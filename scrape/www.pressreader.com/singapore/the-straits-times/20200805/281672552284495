    <p>Sin­ga­pore has made steady progress to­wards re­open­ing the coun­try, mov­ing smoothly into the next stage of phase two while suc­cess­fully keep­ing com­mu­nity trans­mis­sions low. But re­stric­tions could re­turn any time, ex­perts stressed, as they have in many na­tions bat­tling a resur­gence of Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing zero cases dur­ing a full lock­down is to be ex­pected. But the real test of whether a coun­try is cop­ing well is al­low­ing life to re­turn to near nor­malcy while main­tain­ing a low num­ber of com­mu­nity trans­mis­sions for the long term, Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>With the num­ber of daily new com­mu­nity cases in the low sin­gle dig­its, fur­ther eas­ing is set to hap­pen – such as al­low­ing some places of wor­ship to hold gath­er­ings of up to 100 peo­ple from Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“We have to con­tinue to stresstest the sys­tems that we have put in place,” said Prof Teo, point­ing to mea­sures aimed at min­imis­ing com­mu­nity trans­mis­sions and fa­cil­i­tat­ing con­tact trac­ing. These in­clude putting a cap on the num­ber of din­ers per ta­ble, safe dis­tanc­ing in public spa­ces and mask-wear­ing.</p>
    <p>Prof Teo be­lieves that fur­ther eas­ing of the rules is set to hap­pen, which would in­clude al­low­ing more peo­ple to gather so­cially.</p>
    <p>“But I do hope this will not hap­pen too quickly as Covid-19 re­mains highly trans­mis­si­ble and is still out there,” he said.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Alex Cook, vice-dean of re­search at the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, noted that this cau­tious ap­proach of re­lax­ing re­stric­tions has al­lowed Sin­ga­pore to avoid a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions for now, which has de­railed ef­forts by other gov­ern­ments to re­open economies and ease re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Hong Kong had to im­ple­ment fur­ther re­stric­tions at the end of last month, in­clud­ing a ban on gath­er­ings of more than two peo­ple. The Aus­tralian au­thor­i­ties also warned that a sixweek lock­down in parts of the south-eastern Vic­to­ria state may last longer af­ter the coun­try reg­is­tered its high­est daily in­crease in in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Prof Cook is also op­ti­mistic about fur­ther eas­ing here.</p>
    <p>One big change will be the re­turn of cross-bor­der travel, Prof Cook said. Though im­ported cases from coun­tries with high in­fec­tion num­bers is a real risk, it is some­thing which the Sin­ga­pore au­thor­i­ties have learnt to con­tain by putting trav­ellers on quar­an­tine, he added.</p>
    <p>“But for lower risk coun­tries, we can prob­a­bly re­lax that with­out rais­ing the risk too much, es­pe­cially if the trav­ellers are swabbed be­fore en­ter­ing the coun­try. Might that al­low busi­ness travel and some de­gree of per­sonal travel?” Prof Cook mused.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher, a se­nior con­sul­tant in the di­vi­sion of in­fec­tious dis­eases at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal, said it is im­por­tant that these de­ci­sions hap­pen slowly, as in­tro­duc­ing new mea­sures grad­u­ally would give time for the au­thor­i­ties to as­sess if a par­tic­u­lar change is ad­versely af­fect­ing in­fec­tion num­bers.</p>
    <p>“The Covid-19 bat­tle is a marathon and coun­tries that rushed back to­wards pre-Covid life have paid a price,” Prof Fisher said, cau­tion­ing that Sin­ga­pore can­not be too quick to count its chick­ens be­fore they hatch.</p>
    <p>“Any slip by in­di­vid­u­als could spoil this del­i­cate bal­ance for ev­ery­one,” he warned.</p>
    <p>Prof Teo said that where the Repub­lic has done well is in the strict en­force­ment of the rules, such as around mask-wear­ing and safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>“The rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties dili­gently mon­i­tor the im­ple­men­ta­tion of reg­u­la­tions in work­places and public spa­ces, and of­fi­cers and am­bas­sadors check and re­mind the public about the dif­fer­ent guide­lines. I be­lieve this is the main dif­fer­en­tia­tor be­tween Sin­ga­pore and other coun­tries,” Prof Teo said.</p>
    <p>Prof Cook added that a com­pre­hen­sive test­ing strat­egy, ex­ten­sive con­tact trac­ing and treat­ing the quar­an­tine of con­tacts se­ri­ously have also helped to stem com­mu­nity cases.</p>
    <p>But Prof Teo stressed that this does not mean the na­tion has the lib­erty to re­open faster.</p>
    <p>“The pace of eas­ing has to be calibrated so we are able to see which ac­tiv­i­ties ought to be di­alled back down, or mon­i­tored strictly. For ex­am­ple, it was pru­dent to re-en­force some re­stric­tions, such as crowd con­trol mea­sures, on the num­ber of vis­i­tors al­lowed at pop­u­lar public spa­ces such as East Coast Park, Bukit Timah Na­ture Re­serve and the Tree­top Walk. I am heart­ened that Sin­ga­pore does not just re­lax re­stric­tions, but con­tin­ues to mon­i­tor the ef­fects when re­stric­tions are lifted.”</p>
    <p>What lies ahead for all Sin­ga­pore­ans is to con­tinue help­ing the coun­try main­tain a near perfect score card, Prof Teo stressed.</p>
    <p>“The mo­ment a mis­guided pol­icy is im­ple­mented, or a good pol­icy is not ad­hered to, that is when cracks form and clus­ters start spread­ing. We need to look ahead, iden­tify po­ten­tial weak links and blind spots, and con­stantly re­mind ev­ery­one of their re­spon­si­bil­ity to keep this out­break un­der con­trol,” Prof Teo said.</p>
    <p>Prof Cook said other places have shown how frag­ile a suc­cess­ful re­sponse can be – places like Hong Kong and Viet­nam won praise for their man­age­ment of the pan­demic but both had to launch dras­tic mea­sures to ar­rest out­breaks when a resur­gence of cases hap­pened.</p>
    <p>“And this is a re­minder that it, too, could hap­pen here,” he said.</p>
    <p>CALIBRATED EAS­ING</p>
    <p>The pace of eas­ing has to be calibrated so we are able to see which ac­tiv­i­ties ought to be di­alled back down, or mon­i­tored strictly... I am heart­ened that Sin­ga­pore does not just re­lax re­stric­tions, but con­tin­ues to mon­i­tor what are the ef­fects when ’’ re­stric­tions are lifted.
