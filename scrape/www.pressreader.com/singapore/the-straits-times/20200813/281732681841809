    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans will be of­fered more work-study op­por­tu­ni­ties in emerg­ing and growth sec­tors with the in­tro­duc­tion of four new Skill­sFu­ture work-study pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>In­tro­duced by higher learn­ing in­sti­tutes, these pro­grammes will of­fer more than 140 places over the next two years.</p>
    <p>One of them, a Bach­e­lor of Tech­nol­ogy in com­put­ing, will be rolled out this month by the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, in part­ner­ship with Skill­sFu­ture Sin­ga­pore as well as Sin­ga­pore-based global consumer In­ter­net com­pany Sea.</p>
    <p>It will be the first Skill­sFu­ture Work-Study De­gree Pro­gramme to be de­liv­ered in a “place-and-train” mode, with par­tic­i­pants hired as full-time ju­nior an­a­lysts prior to the start of the pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The new pro­grammes were an­nounced by Min­is­ter of State for Ed­u­ca­tion and Man­power Gan Siow Huang at a vir­tual Skill­sFu­ture Work-Study Fair yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The work-study scheme is tar­geted at fresh polytech­nic and In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion grad­u­ates. In­di­vid­u­als who join these pro­grammes hold a job that is as good as be­ing a full-timer in a com­pany, while up­grad­ing their qual­i­fi­ca­tion to a spe­cial­ist or ad­vanced di­ploma through part-time classes.</p>
    <p>As part of the new part­ner­ship, Sea will hire up to 120 stu­dents over the next five years.</p>
    <p>Ngee Ann Polytech­nic and Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic grad­u­ates have been in­vited to ap­ply for the first in­take of this pro­gramme, while en­rol­ment for sub­se­quent in­takes will be open to el­i­gi­ble polytech­nic grad­u­ates from rel­e­vant dis­ci­plines.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants will un­dergo work­place-based train­ing, as­sign­ments and as­sess­ments, which will con­trib­ute close to 30 per cent of cred­its to­wards the de­gree.</p>
    <p>Trainees who grad­u­ate at the end of the 31/ 2- year pro­gramme will have the op­por­tu­nity to be­come full-time an­a­lysts in the com­pany.</p>
    <p>The other three new Skill­sFu­ture Work-Study Pro­grammes, in the bio­med­i­cal sci­ences and me­dia sec­tors, were launched by Nanyang Polytech­nic, Repub­lic Polytech­nic and Te­masek Polytech­nic.</p>
    <p>Ms Gan noted yes­ter­day that many stu­dents have had con­cerns about their grad­u­ate em­ploy­ment prospects due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>She said: “The Covid-19 pan­demic has not only changed our way of life, but also sig­nif­i­cantly dis­rupted our econ­omy. Re­cov­ery will take time and the job mar­ket will be chal­leng­ing in the com­ing years.”</p>
    <p>En­cour­ag­ing fresh grad­u­ates to con­sider tak­ing up work-study pro­grammes, she added: “Be­sides con­fer­ring a higher ed­u­ca­tional qual­i­fi­ca­tion, (the pro­grammes) al­low par­tic­i­pat­ing stu­dents to con­tinue hon­ing their in­dus­try-rel­e­vant skill sets through on-the-job train­ing and work-based projects.</p>
    <p>“From the em­ploy­ers’ per­spec­tive, these pro­grammes en­able com­pa­nies to build their tal­ent pipe­line early. This is espe­cially cru­cial to com­pa­nies look­ing to jump-start their post-pan­demic re­cov­ery.”</p>
    <p>Ms Gan also an­nounced a new por­tal that has been set up to en­able stu­dents and grad­u­ates to learn more about Skill­sFu­ture WorkS­tudy Pro­grammes and sign up for the op­por­tu­ni­ties posted by par­tic­i­pat­ing com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers can also use the por­tal to regis­ter their in­ter­est to par­tic­i­pate in the work-study pro­grammes, post job va­can­cies and hire suit­able trainees.</p>
    <p>Over 130 such op­por­tu­ni­ties are cur­rently fea­tured on the por­tal.</p>
    <p>The Skill­sFu­ture Work-Study Pro­gramme was in­spired by the Ger­man and Swiss tra­di­tion of ap­pren­tice­ships, and was first un­veiled in 2015. It started with 15 pro­grammes across 12 sec­tors, and has now ex­panded to 173 pro­grammes across 36 sec­tors.</p>
    <p>From the em­ploy­ers’ per­spec­tive, these pro­grammes en­able com­pa­nies to build their tal­ent pipe­line early. This is espe­cially cru­cial to com­pa­nies look­ing to jump-start their post-pan­demic re­cov­ery. ’’</p>
