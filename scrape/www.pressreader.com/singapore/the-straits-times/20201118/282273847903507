    <p>The Straits Times In­dex (STI) con­tin­ued its as­cent yes­ter­day, fol­low­ing on the heels of Wall Street, where the S&P hit a record high overnight, as well as pos­i­tive sen­ti­ment on the early success of Moderna’s vac­cine re­sults. Sin­ga­pore Ex­change mar­ket strate­gist Ge­off Howie said: “Mar­kets are tak­ing stock in the fact that the big vac­cine news is walk­ing the walk.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s bench­mark in­dex led the re­gion with its 30.55-point, or 1.1 per cent, in­cline to 2,778.55, as 3.21 bil­lion se­cu­ri­ties worth $1.75 bil­lion changed hands. Ad­vancers out­num­bered de­clin­ers 284 to 199.</p>
    <p>The in­dex’s top per­former was Sin­ga­pore Air­lines. Its shares rose 4.9 per cent to $4.06. The group yes­ter­day said it was dou­bling the limit of its mul­ti­c­ur­rency medium-term note pro­gramme to $10 bil­lion, to raise funds for gen­eral cor­po­rate or work­ing cap­i­tal pur­poses.</p>
    <p>The worst in­dex per­former was As­cen­das Reit, which fin­ished the day 2.6 per cent lower at $2.97. Its units had started de­clin­ing since it an­nounced a $1.2 bil­lion eq­uity fund rais­ing to fi­nance po­ten­tial</p>
    <p>and pro­posed ac­qui­si­tions in the US, Europe and Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Re­gional indices were mostly up. The Hang Seng In­dex added 0.13 per cent; Malaysia’s KLCI gained 0.66 per cent. The Nikkei 225 rose 0.42 per cent, while the Shang­hai Com­pos­ite dipped 0.21 per cent. The most ac­tive counter of the day was LionGold, whose shares rose $0.001 to $0.002 apiece, on a vol­ume of 798 mil­lion shares, af­ter it posted slightly im­proved earn­ings of $1.35 mil­lion for its first quar­ter ended Sept 30 last week.</p>
    <p>Mr Stephen Innes, chief global mar­ket strate­gist at Axi, said that af­ter big gains for risky as­sets fol­low­ing the US elec­tion re­sult, the an­nounce­ment of a po­ten­tially suc­cess­ful Covid-19 vac­cine pro­vided a sec­ond cat­a­lyst to spur mar­kets higher, with most of the funds ro­tat­ing into the lag­gard, cycli­cal and “re­open­ing” sec­tors.</p>
    <p>• Bourses in HK, KL, Tokyo end higher; Shang­hai in­dex dips</p>
