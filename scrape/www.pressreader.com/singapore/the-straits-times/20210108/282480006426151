    <p>To get to lo­cal fra­grance brand Six’s new store in 313@som­er­set, just fol­low the al­lur­ing scent from the base­ment en­trance of Som­er­set MRT sta­tion to the store.</p>
    <p>The ol­fac­tory strat­egy has al­ready worked to at­tract new cus­tomers, says founder Ja­son Lee, 36. They come for the scent and stay for the store ex­pe­ri­ence, he adds.</p>
    <p>The 550 sq ft bou­tique, which opened last month, boasts an earthy pal­ette and soft edges that mimic the con­tours of a cave – or one’s “per­sonal sanc­tu­ary”. Sooth­ing am­bi­ent mu­sic and, of course, calm­ing scents com­plete the cosy ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>He calls it a re­tail-home hy­brid. Per­fumes and mini neb­u­lis­ers are dis­played un­ob­tru­sively on shelves and cof­fee ta­bles. In the back, dif­fer­ent scents are piped out through art­works that clev­erly dis­guise the bulky neb­u­lis­ers be­neath.</p>
    <p>“I want peo­ple to feel com­fort­able here. We don’t want to hard sell them our prod­ucts, but al­low them to ex­pe­ri­ence the con­cept and see how the fra­grances can be ap­plied at home,” says Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>The best­seller is the store scent, a blend named 27°F Biei – the same scent peo­ple smell from the MRT.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee had been look­ing for a sec­ond store space – Six has a bou­tique in Bugis Junc­tion too – since July, af­ter see­ing “good growth in on­line sales” dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The new store was a chance to in­tro­duce Six’s new brand pur­pose – to use fra­grances as a tool to soothe, heal and de­light. He drew de­sign cues from a visit to a co-work­ing space for men­tal health care­givers, where the muted hues and light­ing, and ab­sence of sharp edges, cre­ated a con­ducive en­vi­ron­ment for peo­ple to talk to the coun­sel­lors.</p>
    <p>Spend­ing al­most $150,000 on ren­o­va­tion, he hired lo­cal cre­ative agency In The Wild to de­sign the space, af­ter meet­ing one of its artists, Ms Clara Yee, at an arts fes­ti­val. “She had cre­ated an ex­hi­bi­tion space that was so com­fort­able for peo­ple to walk through; so well-crafted with many an­gles for In­sta­gram-wor­thy shots,” he says.</p>
    <p>Por­tray­ing a “nice home en­vi­ron­ment” was also key as Six in­tends to fo­cus more on its home scents go­ing for­ward.</p>
    <p>WHERE: B2-30, 313@som­er­set</p>
