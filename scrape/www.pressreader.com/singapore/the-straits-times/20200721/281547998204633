    <p>Chil­dren ap­ply­ing to 14 pop­u­lar schools will have to go through bal­lot­ing in the third of seven phases in the an­nual Pri­mary 1 reg­is­tra­tion ex­er­cise. They in­clude Ai Tong School, which has 29 pupils vy­ing for nine places; Gong­shang Pri­mary, which has 33 reg­is­ter­ing for 25; and Te­masek Pri­mary, with 45 try­ing for 13 slots.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren ap­ply­ing to 14 pop­u­lar schools will have to go through bal­lot­ing in the third of seven phases – Phase 2A2 – in the an­nual Pri­mary 1 reg­is­tra­tion ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>They in­clude Ai Tong School, which has 29 pupils vy­ing for nine places; Gong­shang Pri­mary, which has 33 chil­dren reg­is­ter­ing for 25 ; and Te­masek Pri­mary, with 45 chil­dren try­ing for 13 slots.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) said on its web­site last night that for one of the schools – Westwood Pri­mary – which has 77 pupils ap­ply­ing for 71 va­can­cies, all chil­dren with Sin­ga­pore ci­ti­zen­ship had been ad­mit­ted in this phase.</p>
    <p>Bal­lot­ing will be con­ducted for per­ma­nent res­i­dent (PR) chil­dren re­sid­ing within 1km of the school.</p>
    <p>For the other 13 schools, bal­lot­ing will be con­ducted for Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zen chil­dren who live between 1km and 2km, or more than 2km, from the school. The re­sults will be out to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Phase 2A2 is for chil­dren whose sib­lings or par­ents are alumni, whose par­ents are staff of the school, or who are cur­rently in a MOE kinder­garten lo­cated in the pri­mary school.</p>
    <p>In re­cent years, some schools have faced a squeeze be­cause of a rule in­tro­duced in 2014 that re­quires all pri­mary schools to set aside 40 places for chil­dren in the later stages: Phases 2B and 2C.</p>
    <p>Phase 2B is the fourth phase in the ex­er­cise. It is for chil­dren whose par­ents are school vol­un­teers, ac­tive com­mu­nity lead­ers or have ties to church or clan as­so­ci­a­tions di­rectly con­nected with the schools. Reg­is­tra­tion for Phase 2B starts on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Phase 2C is con­sid­ered the most com­pet­i­tive, as it sees the most num­ber of schools need­ing a bal­lot, com­pared with ear­lier stages of the ex­er­cise. It is for chil­dren with no ties to the schools. Reg­is­tra­tion for Phase 2C starts on Aug 3.</p>
    <p>MOE has also said it will be in­tro­duc­ing a cap on the in­take of PR chil­dren in pri­mary schools from this year’s ex­er­cise. This will be about 25 per cent to 30 per cent of a school’s planned Pri­mary 1 in­take, and will only be ap­plied in Phase 2C and 2C Sup­ple­men­tary in 10 schools. The mea­sure is to “pre­vent any con­cen­tra­tion of PR chil­dren in our pri­mary schools, pro­vide a more con­ducive en­vi­ron­ment to en­cour­age in­ter­ac­tion between Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zen and PR chil­dren, and fa­cil­i­tate the in­te­gra­tion of PR chil­dren into Sin­ga­pore”, it said.</p>
    <p>It added that the vast ma­jor­ity of pri­mary schools and PR chil­dren will not be af­fected by this change, as past pat­terns of PR ad­mis­sions are “well be­low the cap of 25 per cent to 30 per cent”.</p>
    <p>Reg­is­tra­tion has been moved com­pletely on­line this year in the light of safe-dis­tanc­ing rules.</p>
