    <p>English Premier League (EPL) in­ves­ti­ga­tors have filed a com­plaint with the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force (SPF) after Brighton for­ward Neal Mau­pay re­ceived threat­en­ing and abu­sive mes­sages on­line from some­one whom they be­lieve to be based in the Repub­lic. The Premier League’s of­fice in Sin­ga­pore de­clined fur­ther com­ment as a po­lice re­port has been made.</p>
    <p>English Premier League in­ves­ti­ga­tors have filed a com­plaint with the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force (SPF) after Brighton for­ward Neal Mau­pay re­ceived threat­en­ing and abu­sive mes­sages on­line from some­one whom they be­lieve to be based in the Repub­lic.</p>
    <p>In an ar­ti­cle on the Premier League web­site posted yesterday, it was re­ported that the in­ves­ti­ga­tors had filed an of­fi­cial com­plaint with the SPF, are li­ais­ing with lo­cal au­thor­i­ties and will sup­port all sub­se­quent le­gal ac­tion on be­half of the player.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old French for­ward signed for Brighton from Brent­ford in the re­cently con­cluded sea­son, scor­ing 10 goals in 37 league games as the Seag­ulls fin­ished 15th out of 20 teams to re­tain their top-flight sta­tus.</p>
    <p>In June, he made the head­lines after scor­ing a dra­matic stop­page­time win­ner in a 2-1 come­back vic­tory over Arse­nal, but was also in­volved in a clash that left Gun­ners goal­keeper Bernd Leno with a knee in­jury.</p>
    <p>Al­though he apol­o­gised for the in­ci­dent, he also said Arse­nal play­ers “need to learn hu­mil­ity” as they were al­legedly mouthing off while in the lead.</p>
    <p>The on­line abuse re­ceived by Mau­pay had been re­ported to the Premier League via its on­line abuse re­port­ing sys­tem, and its in­ves­ti­ga­tions team had been work­ing with the club and the player to re­view the case.</p>
    <p>The Premier League added that it takes on­line abuse se­ri­ously and is com­mit­ted to sup­port­ing play­ers, man­agers and their fam­i­lies who re­ceive such mes­sages. It launched</p>
    <p>SEEK­ING JUS­TICE</p>
    <p>The abuse Neal re­ceived is wholly un­ac­cept­able. We re­sponded im­me­di­ately to seek jus­tice on his be­half, which in this case meant iden­ti­fy­ing the per­pe­tra­tor, track­ing them to where they live, and then pur­su­ing le­gal ac­tion ac­cord­ingly. ’’</p>
    <p>RICHARD MASTERS, Premier League chief ex­ec­u­tive, prom­ises swift ac­tion against those who cross the line.</p>
    <p>the cen­tral rapid re­sponse re­port­ing sys­tem in June.</p>
    <p>Premier League chief ex­ec­u­tive Richard Masters said: “The abuse Neal re­ceived is wholly un­ac­cept­able.</p>
    <p>“We re­sponded im­me­di­ately to seek jus­tice on his be­half, which in this case meant iden­ti­fy­ing the per­pe­tra­tor, track­ing them to where they live, and then pur­su­ing le­gal ac­tion ac­cord­ingly.</p>
    <p>“We take each re­port pro­vided to us ex­tremely se­ri­ously and we will use all pos­si­ble re­sources in sup­port­ing our play­ers and man­agers to in­ves­ti­gate in­ci­dents, re­gard­less of where the of­fender is lo­cated.”</p>
    <p>The Premier League’s of­fice in Sin­ga­pore de­clined fur­ther com­ment as a po­lice re­port has been made.</p>
