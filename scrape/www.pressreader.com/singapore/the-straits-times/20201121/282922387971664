    <p>Fer­rari de­clared last week that it would never have a fully elec­tric line-up.</p>
    <p>This must be mu­sic to the ears of petrol­heads, be­cause com­bus­tion en­gines from the Maranello mar­que make some of the most beau­ti­ful sounds on the planet.</p>
    <p>In a con­vert­ible like the newly landed F8 Spi­der, you get to savour ev­ery strain of that soul­ful, hair­rais­ing me­chan­i­cal mu­sic un­fil­tered.</p>
    <p>Yes, you also en­joy the V8 in the Spi­der’s coupe sib­ling – with mod­ern acous­tic aids, engine sounds are clev­erly trans­mit­ted into the cabin. But with an open-top, your whole be­ing is im­mersed in the con­certo – you are not merely seated in front of hi-fi speak­ers.</p>
    <p>The strange thing about the Spi­der is that there is barely any dis­cernible dif­fer­ence in sound pro­duc­tion be­tween Sport (Nor­mal for Fer­rari) and Race drive modes.</p>
    <p>In the Trib­uto (the coupe ver­sion tested in March), the dif­fer­ence was quite per­cep­ti­ble.</p>
    <p>With 720hp and 770Nm of torque (same as the coupe), it does not mat­ter which mode you are driv­ing in. There is plenty of shove across the rev range, even if you some­times have to work a lit­tle to ac­cess it.</p>
    <p>Given an open stretch of tar­mac,</p>
    <p>the Spi­der will take off like a bird out of the cage, with its tacho wa­ver­ing be­tween 2,500 and 5,000rpm as it piles on speed.</p>
    <p>As with all mod­ern Fer­raris, it does this with a con­trolled fe­roc­ity. The car be­haves pre­dictably and hardly ever takes you by sur­prise.</p>
    <p>Its steer­ing re­mains cen­tred and true de­spite the road and re­quires al­most no correction once the course is set.</p>
    <p>Body rigid­ity and ride qual­ity are com­mon is­sues convertibl­es grap­ple with. If the F8 Spi­der has these short­com­ings, it does not show them.</p>
    <p>The car weighs some 70kg more than the coupe, but its ride is still very de­cent for a sports car and its han­dling is still de­light­ful.</p>
    <p>All these make Fer­rari’s lat­est drop-top a com­pet­i­tive per­former which gives no quarters to its coupe twin. In fact, its cen­tury sprint takes a blis­ter­ing 2.9 sec­onds, which is iden­ti­cal to the Trib­uto’s. So is its 340kmh top speed.</p>
    <p>This is some­what sur­pris­ing, since a heftier car will im­pact per­for­mance fig­ures, even if marginally.</p>
    <p>For day-to-day driv­ing, the car’s mas­sive fire­power is not al­ways ob­vi­ous. You have to work the throt­tle and the shift pad­dles to keep the engine on the boil to savour the best of what it has to of­fer. Or you can en­joy the car as you would a gor­geous art­work.</p>
    <p>Switch­ing from this mode to the rub­bing-burn­ing mode is not as in­stan­ta­neous as you might ex­pect. A car with a far less im­pres­sive ac­cel­er­a­tion fig­ure, like the Porsche Tay­can 4S (0-100kmh in four sec­onds), feels more im­me­di­ate and re­spon­sive on the whole.</p>
    <p>The Tay­can is, of course, elec­tric. And elec­tric cars do of­fer this seam­less ease when tran­si­tion­ing from Jekyll to Hyde.</p>
    <p>So, even if Fer­rari will not have a com­pletely elec­tric line-up, you can bet your last dol­lar it will have at least one such ride within the next decade.</p>
    <p>Be­cause, af­ter all, what is sound with­out fury?</p>
