    <p>I sup­port the new tri­par­tite work group that will study how to in­crease the wages of more low-in­come work­ers (New tri­par­tite group to study how to raise pay of low-wage work­ers, Oct 30).</p>
    <p>To fur­ther pro­tect work­ers, I hope the group also pro­poses mech­a­nisms to iden­tify and dis­cour­age firms which are op­pres­sive in their wage struc­tures and which may be ex­ploit­ing work­ers.</p>
    <p>In­ter­ven­tion mech­a­nisms like the pro­gres­sive wage model or a min­i­mum wage, and di­rect trans­fers like Work­fare, pro­vide a rem­edy for work­ers who re­ceive a lack­ing wage.</p>
    <p>How­ever, we need to go beyond these mech­a­nisms to iden­tify and pre­vent un­fair sup­pres­sion of wages.</p>
    <p>All busi­nesses try to keep costs low to max­imise prof­its, but what if some busi­nesses go too far?</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, there may be em­ploy­ers who are keep­ing work­ers’ wages ex­ces­sively low while pay­ing them­selves large salaries and declar­ing hefty prof­its for their share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>They may refuse calls to in­crease low wages by in­sist­ing that the work­ers im­prove their pro­duc­tiv­ity first.</p>
    <p>Low-wage work­ers of­ten lack the bar­gain­ing power and in­for­ma­tion to suc­cess­fully ne­go­ti­ate with such em­ploy­ers. Find­ing an­other job is also not al­ways an op­tion.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore today, I hope we can rely on our strong tri­par­tite re­la­tion­ship to ad­dress this.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment could also con­sider act­ing against par­tic­u­larly er­rant firms and con­sider them in­el­i­gi­ble for govern­ment as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>This is a dif­fi­cult pe­riod for many of us. Em­ploy­ers and em­ploy­ees need to trust and de­pend on one an­other.</p>
    <p>I hope the tri­par­tite group will make rec­om­men­da­tions to help sus­tain the wel­fare of our work­ers, sup­port our strug­gling firms which are le­git­i­mately try­ing hard to keep their busi­nesses go­ing and act against er­rant em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>I hope Sin­ga­pore will be able to pro­tect busi­nesses and jobs, and bal­ance prof­its with em­pa­thy. Ah­mad Fir­daus Daud</p>
