    <p>KLU­ANG • As strong flood­wa­ter cur­rents took hold of their Pro­ton Waja, a wor­ried hus­band broke the car win­dow to let his wife out – where she was later res­cued by passers-by.</p>
    <p>Mr Md Ra­ji­han Ju­naidi, 28, how­ever, was not as for­tu­nate.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a three-day search, the au­thor­i­ties found his body in a ba­nana farm about 100m away from the main road yes­ter­day evening.</p>
    <p>Klu­ang po­lice chief Low Hang Seng con­firmed that Mr Ra­ji­han’s body had been found.</p>
    <p>“The in­ci­dent oc­curred at about 5.30pm on Satur­day at Batu 18 Jalan Batu Pa­hat-Mers­ing near Ka­hang. The vic­tim had tried to cross the road in his car, but was pushed to the right side of the road by the strong cur­rent,” said Mr Low.</p>
    <p>“The vic­tim broke a win­dow to free his wife. She was later res­cued by mem­bers of the pub­lic. How­ever, he could not get out in time as the car was swept away by the cur­rents,” he said.</p>
    <p>This was the third life lost due to floods in Jo­hor, re­ported The Star. As at 8pm yes­ter­day, the num­ber of flood evac­uees in the south­ern state stood at 5,524.</p>
    <p>On Satur­day, Jo­hor recorded its first flood-re­lated death af­ter a 59-year-old woman fell into a drain along Jalan Se­tia in Kam­pung Con­toh in Klu­ang. The body of Madam Hal­i­jah Ma­jid was re­cov­ered by mem­bers of the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate in­ci­dent, a fam­ily of four on their way back to Muar from Mers­ing found them­selves stranded along Jalan Klu­ang-Mers­ing, Ka­hang, for at least 11 hours be­fore they were res­cued.</p>
    <p>SMK Bukit Pasir teacher Abdul Aziz Je­main and his wife Khairiy­atul Asma, both 30, and their two tod­dlers reached Batu 17, Jalan Klu­ang-Mers­ing at around 3pm on Satur­day – only to find the road flooded.</p>
    <p>“I turned the car around to head back to my home town in Mers­ing but flood­wa­ters had gushed onto the road at Batu 18.</p>
    <p>“With the ac­cess cut off, we had no choice but to wait in the car, along with about 15 other ve­hi­cles, for help, which came at around 2am the fol­low­ing day,” he said at the SMK Seri Sem­brong tem­po­rary flood shel­ter on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, in the eastern state of Pa­hang, fire and res­cue per­son­nel were search­ing yes­ter­day for a woman and her daugh­ter who were swept away by flood­wa­ters af­ter a boat they were on cap­sized in Sun­gai Je­lai, Lipis, about 250km from state cap­i­tal Kuantan, ac­cord­ing to na­tional news agency Ber­nama.</p>
