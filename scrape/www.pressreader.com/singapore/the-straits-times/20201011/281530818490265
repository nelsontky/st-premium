    <p>A new in­ter-agency task force has been con­vened by the Govern­ment to pro­vide a co­or­di­nated na­tional re­sponse to the mental health needs of Sin­ga­pore­ans aris­ing from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing yes­ter­day at the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s vir­tual event, The Big Event for Mental Health, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said it was an ex­am­ple of how Sin­ga­pore has worked to raise mental health lit­er­acy, pro­mote early in­ter­ven­tion and im­prove mental health ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 Mental Well­ness Task­force was con­vened by the Min­istry of Health and the In­sti­tute of Mental Health.</p>
    <p>It will re­view the psy­cho-so­cial im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic on the pop­u­la­tion and take stock of the ini­tia­tives in­tro­duced across the Govern­ment to ad­dress the im­pact so far, MOH said yes­ter­day in re­sponse to queries.</p>
    <p>The task force will also iden­tify gaps that will need to be ad­dressed to bet­ter meet the mental health needs of the pop­u­la­tion dur­ing this time.</p>
    <p>Its mem­bers in­clude rep­re­sen­ta­tives from the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion; Min­istry of Man­power; Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment; Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth; Health Pro­mo­tion Board; Agency for In­te­grated Care; Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion; and the Na­tional Coun­cil of So­cial Ser­vice.</p>
    <p>In his speech, PM Lee said that en­sur­ing ac­cess to qual­ity mental health­care for ev­ery Sin­ga­porean is a ma­jor pri­or­ity, with one in seven peo­ple here suf­fer­ing from a mental health con­di­tion at some point.</p>
    <p>He said aware­ness of the im­por­tance of mental health has grown, but peo­ple with mental health con</p>
    <p>With Covid-19, more peo­ple are fac­ing stresses, pres­sures and dis­rup­tions to their lives and liveli­hoods. Health au­thor­i­ties around the world must not only fight Covid-19, but also man­age its im­pact on the mental health of their pop­u­la­tions... Let’s re­solve to work to­gether to un­der­stand mental health bet­ter, and to care for one another dur­ing these dif­fi­cult times.</p>
    <p>ditions are still not well un­der­stood or fully ac­cepted.</p>
    <p>“With Covid-19, more peo­ple are fac­ing stresses, pres­sures and dis­rup­tions to their lives and liveli­hoods.</p>
    <p>“Health au­thor­i­ties around the world must not only fight Covid-19, but also man­age its im­pact on the mental health of their pop­u­la­tions,” said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>Pro­tect­ing mental health takes a col­lec­tive ef­fort, he said, not­ing ef­forts like the Na­tional Care Hot­line which was set up dur­ing the early stage of the coro­n­avirus out­break here to pro­vide psy­cho­log­i­cal first aid and emo­tional sup­port.</p>
    <p>“To­day, on World Mental Health Day, let’s re­solve to work to­gether to un­der­stand mental health bet­ter, and to care for one another dur­ing these dif­fi­cult times,” said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral other politi­cians were in­volved in mental health-re­lated di­a­logues and events yes­ter­day, in­clud­ing Min­is­ter of State for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth and Trade and In­dus­try Alvin Tan.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing on a panel hosted by Face­book, Mr Tan said mental health con­cerns are not a re­cent phe­nom­e­non, with peo­ple hav­ing lived through events like World War II and past re­ces­sions where they would have ex­pe­ri­enced con­sid­er­able stress.</p>
    <p>But the ac­cel­er­a­tion of tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vance­ments in the past 15 to 20 years has im­pli­ca­tions for mental health, both good and bad.</p>
    <p>These in­clude be­ing bet­ter able to con­nect with each other, but also be­ing sub­ject to un­healthy com­par­isons and cy­ber bul­ly­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said big tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies like Face­book have im­por­tant roles to play in pro­mot­ing on­line safety and mental well­ness in a dig­i­tal age through ac­tions like re­fin­ing al­go­rithms to en­sure the con­tent they host is safe, and by pro­vid­ing re­sources to those in need.</p>
    <p>At a separate event hosted by the Sil­ver Rib­bon non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion, a youth mental health re­source kit was launched to pro­mote mental health, re­duce sui­cide rates and build re­silience.</p>
    <p>The kit con­tains in­for­ma­tion on var­i­ous mental health is­sues and rec­om­men­da­tions by stu­dents, par­ents, teach­ers and school coun­sel­lors on how to man­age a list of chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Sa­mar­i­tans of Sin­ga­pore (SOS), a cri­sis in­ter­ven­tion and sui­cide preven­tion cen­tre, of­fi­cially launched its text mes­sag­ing ser­vice for in­di­vid­u­als in dis­tress yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The ser­vice is avail­able through Face­book Mes­sen­ger or on the SOS web­site from 6pm to 6am on week­days, ex­cept pub­lic hol­i­days.</p>
