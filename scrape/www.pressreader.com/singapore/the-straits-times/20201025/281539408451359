    <p>Malaysia’s nine royal house­holds, which are part of a unique con­sti­tu­tional monar­chy sys­tem, have long been con­tent with play­ing a pas­sive role in up­hold­ing Malay-Mus­lim val­ues in the coun­try’s com­plex and of­ten com­bustible mul­tira­cial pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>Now, with the eth­nic Malay com­mu­nity di­vided like never be­fore, the King is be­ing dragged into the fray to play the cen­tral role of ad­ju­di­ca­tor in a bid to re­solve the coun­try’s wors­en­ing po­lit­i­cal grid­lock – de­vel­op­ments that are stir­ring fresh de­bate on the role of the monar­chy in so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>The King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah, has been re­luc­tant to take on the task be­cause any de­ci­sion would be con­strued as tak­ing sides in the deeply di­vided po­lit­i­cal land­scape.</p>
    <p>But the neu­tral po­si­tion he has adopted in re­cent weeks when deal­ing with Op­po­si­tion Leader An­war Ibrahim’s bid to form the next gov­ern­ment is no longer an op­tion.</p>
    <p>In the com­ing days, the King and his brother rulers must de­cide whether to sanc­tion a con­tro­ver­sial plan by Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin to de­clare a state of emer­gency.</p>
    <p>Sources say the gov­ern­ment is seek­ing the dec­la­ra­tion so that gov­ern­ment spend­ing can be ap­proved with­out go­ing through Par­lia­ment, and to avoid hold­ing elec­tions if Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s gov­ern­ment fails to prove its ma­jor­ity in the bud­get vote early next month.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment’s ar­gu­ment is that emer­gency mea­sures, which could in­clude sus­pend­ing Par­lia­ment, are needed to deal with the pan­demic amid po­lit­i­cal in­sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>But the move has been roundly at­tacked by politi­cians and pub­lic in­ter­est groups as a des­per­ate bid by the em­bat­tled Muhyid­din ad­min­is­tra­tion to cling on to power, prompt­ing calls for the King and the Con­fer­ence of Rulers to be more vis­i­ble in ad­ju­di­cat­ing the po­lit­i­cal process.</p>
    <p>“In un­prece­dented times there is a need for a ref­eree. But the only trou­ble is that many politi­cians are not above ma­nip­u­lat­ing the royal power to their ad­van­tage,” said a se­nior mem­ber of Datuk Seri An­war’s Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat.</p>
    <p>The move to lean on Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah, who was in­stalled as King for a five-year term in late July last year, to re­solve the cur­rent po­lit­i­cal cri­sis rep­re­sents a ma­jor twist in the re­la­tions of Malaysia’s po­lit­i­cal elite and the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>Re­la­tions be­tween the two pil­lars of Malay po­lit­i­cal dom­i­nance have long been prickly, par­tic­u­larly dur­ing the first pre­mier­ship of Tun Dr Ma­hathir Mo­hamad, which be­gan in 1981 and lasted 22 years. Dur­ing that time, Dr Ma­hathir took on the sul­tans on three sep­a­rate oc­ca­sions and in each en­counter se­cured ma­jor vic­to­ries in curb­ing their lim­ited pow­ers.</p>
    <p>The ta­bles were turned on Dr Ma­hathir in March, dur­ing his sec­ond stint in of­fice, when he abruptly re­signed from the pre­mier­ship fol­low­ing the col­lapse of his Pakatan Hara­pan coali­tion.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir had in­tended for the King to al­low him to con­sti­tute a so­called unity gov­ern­ment to re­solve the cri­sis at the time.</p>
    <p>But the break­away po­lit­i­cal fac­tion from his own Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia led by Mr Muhyid­din con­vinced the Con­fer­ence of Rulers that a new premier should be elected.</p>
    <p>Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah spent days meet­ing lawmakers and heads of po­lit­i­cal par­ties be­fore he es­tab­lished that Mr Muhyid­din en­joyed ma­jor­ity sup­port in the 222-mem­ber Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>But the ra­zor-thin ma­jor­ity of just two MPs that the em­bat­tled Premier is widely be­lieved to com­mand is now in ques­tion, fol­low­ing Mr An­war’s dec­la­ra­tion last month that he had se­cured “for­mi­da­ble” sup­port from a ma­jor­ity of MPs, in­clud­ing pow­er­ful fac­tions in Umno, the largest party back­ing Mr Muhyid­din’s Perikatan Na­sional coali­tion gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war has in­sisted that in a meet­ing with the King, he had pro­vided Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah with doc­u­men­tary ev­i­dence of the sup­port he en­joys, and his po­lit­i­cal al­lies have been push­ing the palace to ini­ti­ate a process for the change in gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>But sev­eral lawyers con­tend that the King’s pow­ers are too lim­ited to ini­ti­ate any lead­er­ship change.</p>
    <p>“The King stepped in (in March) be­cause Dr Ma­hathir had re­signed. There needs to be a trig­ger for the King to in­ter­vene this time around,” noted a lawyer closely aligned to for­mer premier Na­jib Razak, who re­mains a pow­er­ful force in Umno de­spite be­ing tainted by the scan­dal sur­round­ing the 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had state in­vest­ment firm.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din’s move on Fri­day to push his pro­posal for emer­gency mea­sures has made it more ur­gent for the King to deal with is­sues over the cur­rent gov­ern­ment’s le­git­i­macy to rule and Mr An­war’s power bid.</p>
    <p>The Op­po­si­tion Leader claims that he has the back­ing of more than 120 elected MPs in the coun­try’s 222-mem­ber Lower House.</p>
    <p>But he has not made pub­lic a list of those sup­port­ing him, rais­ing doubts about the claim.</p>
    <p>Un­der Malaysian law, only the King can de­clare a state of emer­gency if he is sat­is­fied there is a threat to na­tional se­cu­rity. There have been four oc­ca­sions since in­de­pen­dence when a state of emer­gency was de­clared, with the most se­ri­ous in the af­ter­math of the bloody race ri­ots in May 1969. An­other na­tion­wide one was de­clared in 1964 dur­ing the In­done­sia-Malaysia Con­fronta­tion, af­ter In­done­sian sol­diers landed on Malaysian soil.</p>
    <p>Two other dec­la­ra­tions were lim­ited i n na­ture to the states of Sarawak and Ke­lan­tan.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s in­ter­nal se­cu­rity sit­u­a­tion is far from tense or men­ac­ing even though the num­ber of Covid-19 cases has been ris­ing steadily in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal tem­per­a­tures have risen in tan­dem with the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, with the ra­zor-thin ma­jor­ity that brought Mr Muhyid­din the pre­mier­ship in March in­creas­ingly in se­ri­ous doubt.</p>
    <p>Over the last seven months, the Prime Min­is­ter has dodged bids from his ri­vals for a mo­tion of con­fi­dence in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>That vote is sched­uled to be tested on Nov 6 when the gov­ern­ment ta­bles its bud­get in Par­lia­ment and, ac­cord­ing to politi­cians from both sides of the di­vide, the prospect of the spend­ing Bill be­ing re­jected is very likely.</p>
    <p>The po­lit­i­cal log­jam has left Malaysia with no choice but to turn to the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>There are sev­eral op­tions open to Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah.</p>
    <p>First, he could per­suade Mr Muhyid­din to step down if he is con­vinced that Mr An­war’s sup­port in Par­lia­ment will lead to the for­ma­tion of a sta­ble gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The King could also toss the is­sue to Par­lia­ment and re­quest that the Speaker of the Lower House con­vene a spe­cial sit­ting to hold a con­fi­dence vote that could pave the way for a han­dover of power.</p>
    <p>Al­ter­na­tively, the King could push for the dis­so­lu­tion of Par­lia­ment and set the stage for fresh elec­tions that must be held within 60 days, a prospect that every­one ac­knowl­edges would be a dis­as­ter against the back­drop of the ris­ing num­ber of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah and his brother rulers will have to de­cide in the com­ing days what, in their opin­ion, would be best for the coun­try and its peo­ple.</p>
