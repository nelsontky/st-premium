    <p>9 While Sin­ga­pore sports­men and women are now given more say in some as­so­ci­a­tions, oth­ers are not suf­fi­ciently in­volved in de­ci­sion mak­ing and the key is­sue ap­pears to be trust, says Mr Mark Chay, who chairs the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Olympic Coun­cil ath­letes’ com­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal ath­letes have more say in their na­tional bod­ies than ever be­fore but more can be done to em­power them at the ex­ec­u­tive level so they are able to ef­fect change.</p>
    <p>Mark Chay, who chairs the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Olympic Coun­cil (SNOC) ath­letes’ com­mis­sion, says that for this to hap­pen, trust is re­quired.</p>
    <p>There is some form of ath­lete rep­re­sen­ta­tion in 13 of the 64 na­tional sports as­so­ci­a­tions (NSAs) in Sin­ga­pore but only three are in­volved in de­ci­sion-mak­ing at the ex­ec­u­tive level, for ex­am­ple in man­age­ment com­mit­tees (MCs).</p>
    <p>Chay, a for­mer na­tional swim­mer, said: “I’ve spo­ken to many of the NSAs and I know which are re­cep­tive (to the idea) and which are not.</p>
    <p>“There is the idea from those that are not, that the ath­letes’ rep­re­sen­ta­tives will use the op­por­tu­nity to gain in­for­ma­tion and un­der­mine (NSA lead­er­ship)... and so they just don’t trust their ath­letes enough.</p>
    <p>“There may also be a sit­u­a­tion where NSAs can­not find a suit­able rep­re­sen­ta­tive (but)... from ev­ery­thing I have heard, I think it re­ally is mainly about trust. And NSA lead­ers have to re­ally open their minds if this were to hap­pen.”</p>
    <p>The is­sue of ath­lete rep­re­sen­ta­tion in NSAs is in the spot­light fol­low­ing Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics’ (SA) ex­tra­or­di­nary gen­eral meet­ing last Mon­day, in which the track and field fra­ter­nity tabled a pro­posal to re­move vot­ing rights for its ath­letes’ com­mis­sion rep­re­sen­ta­tive. The pro­posed amend­ment re­mains un­re­solved.</p>
    <p>The pur­pose of such com­mis­sions or rep­re­sen­ta­tives is to rep­re­sent the voice of ath­letes in their re­spec­tive NSAs, serv­ing as a link to man­age­ment so sports­men and women can ar­tic­u­late their con­cerns or feed­back.</p>
    <p>MARGINAL IM­PROVE­MENT</p>
    <p>Chay says the over­all land­scape has im­proved. When he was elected SNOC ath­letes’ com­mis­sion chair in 2017, just one NSA – the Sin­ga­pore Swim­ming As­so­ci­a­tion (SSA) – had an ath­letes’ com­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>There are now seven. The govern­ing bod­ies for ath­let­ics, bad­minton, ca­noe­ing, gym­nas­tics, silat and table ten­nis have since formed re­spec­tive ath­letes’ com­mit­tees or com­mis­sions. The Sin­ga­pore Dis­abil­ity Sports Coun­cil also has one.</p>
    <p>Six NSAs – bowl­ing, cy­cling, fenc­ing, rugby, sail­ing and ten­nis – also for­mally recog­nised ath­lete rep­re­sen­ta­tives.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Sport Sin­ga­pore (SportSG) told The Straits Times: “More NSAs are ex­pected to form their own ath­letes’ com­mis­sion as rec­om­mended by SportSG’s model NSA constituti­on.”</p>
    <p>The na­tional sports agency has told ST that it is sup­port­ing ef­forts by the NSAs “to pro­fes­sion­alise and strengthen their gov­er­nance” and that it has “pro­vided guid­ance through a set of gov­er­nance prin­ci­ples for NSAs and a tem­plate of a model constituti­on” to help them re­vise their re­spec­tive char­ters.</p>
    <p>How­ever, only ath­let­ics, ten­nis and ca­noe­ing have these rep­re­sen­ta­tives in their re­spec­tive MCs.</p>
    <p>A STEP BACK­WARDS</p>
    <p>SA’s bid to re­move its ath­letes’ rep­re­sen­ta­tive’s vot­ing rights, there­fore, is seen as a step back­wards by some. Chay was dis­heart­ened by SA’s pro­posed change.</p>
    <p>“I thought that giv­ing their ath­letes a voice and a vote (last year) was a very pro­gres­sive thing, and go­ing back now is re­gres­sive,” he said.</p>
    <p>“My con­ver­sa­tions with SA (on the mat­ter) have also been dis­ap­point­ing be­cause from what I un­der­stand, SA is moot­ing the change be­cause of one in­di­vid­ual.</p>
    <p>“But if you are un­happy with an in­di­vid­ual, deal with that in­di­vid­ual, don’t change the sys­tem. To do this is to take away the vote of the peo­ple they are sup­posed to serve.”</p>
    <p>Na­tional marathoner Soh Rui Yong, who sued SA for defama­tion last year over its state­ment on his non-se­lec­tion for the 2019 SEA Games, said that ath­lete rep­re­sen­ta­tion at the ex­ec­u­tive level is vi­tal to help sports­men and women deal with “on-the-ground chal­lenges” in mod­ern sport, which he be­lieves some on the as­so­ci­a­tion’s MC are “out of touch with”.</p>
    <p>“The ath­letes’ (rep­re­sen­ta­tive) is just as im­por­tant if not more so than the other mem­bers as they (rep­re­sent)... the most im­por­tant stake­hold­ers in this sport – the ath­letes,” he ar­gued.</p>
    <p>“In the SA (gen­eral meet­ing on Mon­day), I be­lieve (hon­orary sec­re­tary) Eric Song said that the ath­letes’ com­mis­sion need not have vot­ing rights, and can still have their voice heard at the table. To me, that is rub­bish.</p>
    <p>“As it is, it doesn’t look to me like that MC lis­tens to the ath­letes’ com­mis­sion when it does have vot­ing rights. What more when it doesn’t?”</p>
    <p>SA has told ST that the de­ci­sion to re­voke the ath­letes’ com­mis­sion rep­re­sen­ta­tive’s vot­ing rights was done with a broader prin­ci­ple in mind – that non-elected mem­bers of its MC or board, who were not demo­crat­i­cally elected by the as­so­ci­a­tion’s clubs, should not be given a vote.</p>
    <p>Soh, who won the marathon at the 2015 and 2017 SEA Games, added that he be­lieved ev­ery NSA should have not just one but two ath­lete rep­re­sen­ta­tives – one male and one fe­male – with both ac­corded vot­ing rights at ex­ec­u­tive level.</p>
    <p>OTHER AV­ENUES AVAIL­ABLE</p>
    <p>BE BROAD-MINDED</p>
    <p>From ev­ery­thing I have heard, I think it re­ally is mainly about trust. And NSA lead­ers have to re­ally open their minds if this were to ’’ hap­pen. MARK CHAY, head of the SNOC’s ath­letes’ com­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>FEED­BACK IS IM­POR­TANT</p>
    <p>I think it’s def­i­nitely good and im­por­tant for the ath­letes’ voice to be heard, but the means would be de­pen­dent on the struc­ture of the ’’ or­gan­i­sa­tion. LEE KOK CHOY, pres­i­dent of the SSA.</p>
    <p>RE­MEM­BER WHO THEY REP­RE­SENT</p>
    <p>The ath­letes’ (rep­re­sen­ta­tive) is just as im­por­tant if not more so than the other mem­bers as they (rep­re­sent)... the most im­por­tant stake­hold­ers in this sport – the ’’ ath­letes. SOH RUI YONG, marathoner.</p>
    <p>SSA pres­i­dent Lee Kok Choy de­scribed his as­so­ci­a­tion’s re­la­tion­ship with its ath­letes’ com­mis­sion, which is headed by Pang Sheng Jun, as “pro­duc­tive and valu­able”.</p>
    <p>Yet he stopped short of ex­hort­ing all NSAs to have of­fi­cial ath­lete rep­re­sen­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>“I think it’s def­i­nitely good and im­por­tant for the ath­letes’ voice to be heard, but the means would be de­pen­dent on the struc­ture of the or­gan­i­sa­tion,” he said. “It could be a com­mis­sion, a sin­gle rep­re­sen­ta­tive, or an equiv­a­lent – the main con­sid­er­a­tion is that prob­lems must be heard and is­sues must be ad­dressed. Dif­fer­ent sports have dif­fer­ent con­sid­er­a­tions, so I would rather not be too pre­scrip­tive.”</p>
    <p>He added that hav­ing an ath­letes’ rep­re­sen­ta­tive at the MC level might not be the most op­ti­mal ap­proach, as it would re­quire them to be a part of “sup­port work” done by the NSA such as work­ing with spon­sors, or strate­gis­ing coach­ing cer­ti­fi­ca­tions, which do not have a di­rect im­pact on ath­letes’ well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>In foot­ball, R. Sasiku­mar, and then fel­low for­mer na­tional de­fender Hafiz Os­man, tried but failed to set up play­ers’ unions to safe­guard the in­ter­ests of play­ers, many of whom ply their trade in the Sin­ga­pore Premier League (SPL).</p>
    <p>The SPL is the only pro­fes­sional sports league in Sin­ga­pore, and there have been nu­mer­ous con­trac­tual dis­putes be­tween clubs and play­ers since the league was started in 1996, when it was known as the S-League.</p>
    <p>A Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (FAS) spokesman told ST that while it does not have of­fi­cial ath­lete rep­re­sen­ta­tion in the NSA, it has es­tab­lished var­i­ous stand­ing com­mit­tees – such as the play­ers’ sta­tus com­mit­tee and play­ers’ wel­fare com­mit­tee – to look into dif­fer­ent ar­eas of the lo­cal ecosys­tem.</p>
    <p>Added the spokesman: “The ma­jor­ity of these stand­ing com­mit­tees are led by and/or con­sist of mem­bers of the cur­rent FAS coun­cil, of which three are for­mer in­ter­na­tional play­ers (Razali Saad, Lim Tong Hai and Yakob Hashim).</p>
    <p>“Although re­tired from ac­tive play, they re­main a key con­duit for ac­tive play­ers, and hav­ing gone through sim­i­lar ex­pe­ri­ences them­selves, they are able to re­late to the cur­rent play­ers and en­sure that their in­ter­ests are taken care of.”</p>
