    <p>SEOUL • South Korea’s new daily Covid-19 case count topped 200 for the sec­ond con­sec­u­tive day yes­ter­day due to spo­radic clus­ters of in­fec­tions, prompt­ing the health au­thor­i­ties to con­sider tight­en­ing re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>South Korea re­ported 208 new coro­n­avirus cases – 176 lo­cally trans­mit­ted and 32 i mported from over­seas, ac­cord­ing to the Korea Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion Agency.</p>
    <p>The daily tally saw a triple-digit gain for eight days straight as of yes­ter­day, with the num­ber of new cases hav­ing ex­ceeded 200 for the first time in 73 days on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>With spo­radic clus­ters of in­fec­tions con­tin­u­ing to emerge in con­nec­tion with so­cial gath­er­ings, nurs­ing homes and med­i­cal in­sti­tu­tions as well as work­places, the gov­ern­ment is mulling over whether to move up the level of so­cial dis­tanc­ing by a notch to level 1.5 in its five-tier scheme.</p>
    <p>Level 1 rules have been in place in most parts of the coun­try, rep­re­sent­ing the low­est level of vig­i­lance, with some mu­nic­i­pal­i­ties hav­ing raised the level due to out­breaks in their re­gions.</p>
    <p>Level 1 rules are im­posed when the num­ber of daily new cases is be­low 100 in the Greater Seoul area; be­low 30 in the Chungcheon­g, Je­olla and Gyeongsang prov­inces; and be­low 10 in Gang­won prov­ince and on Jeju Is­land.</p>
    <p>Un­der level 1, peo­ple must fol­low ba­sic guide­lines such as wear­ing a mask, and gath­er­ings of more than 500 peo­ple are not rec­om­mended.</p>
    <p>Un­der level 1.5, gath­er­ings of 100 or more peo­ple are re­stricted, eat­ing and danc­ing at high-risk fa­cil­i­ties such as night­clubs and karaoke rooms are pro­hib­ited, and fewer peo­ple are al­lowed i nside i ndoor fa­cil­i­ties such as fu­neral homes, pub­lic saunas, the­atres and pri­vate cram schools.</p>
    <p>Of the 32 im­ported cases, 14 were iden­ti­fied while they were un­der manda­tory self-quar­an­tine in South Korea, with the other 18 de­tected dur­ing screen­ings at the bor­der.</p>
    <p>Six­teen cases were from else­where in Asia, 10 from the Amer­i­cas and six from Europe. Ten of the im­ported cases in­volved for­eign na­tion­als.</p>
    <p>So far, of the 28,546 peo­ple con­firmed to have con­tracted the coro­n­avirus, 25,691 have been re­leased from quar­an­tine upon mak­ing full re­cov­ery. Some 2,362 peo­ple are re­ceiv­ing med­i­cal treat­ment un­der quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>The death toll stands at 493 and the over­all fa­tal­ity rate is 1.73 per cent. The num­ber of Covid-19 pa­tients in se­ri­ous or crit­i­cal con­di­tion is 56.</p>
    <p>The coun­try car­ried out 9,589 tests in the past day. A to­tal of 36,378 peo­ple are await­ing re­sults of their tests.</p>
