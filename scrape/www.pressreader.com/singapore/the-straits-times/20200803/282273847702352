    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) • All the talk has been of a po­ten­tial Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) Fi­nals match-up be­tween the l eague’s lead­ing teams, the Mil­wau­kee Bucks and the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers.</p>
    <p>That suits the Toronto Rap­tors just fine. The Cana­dian team were sim­i­larly over­looked en route to their first cham­pi­onship last year and op­po­nents will learn the hard way if they con­tinue to un­der­es­ti­mate them.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the Lak­ers (50-15) suf­fered their se­cond loss in two match-ups this sea­son, fall­ing 107-92 to the Rap­tors at Dis­ney World on Satur­day, Le­Bron James be­lieves they have to be in­cluded in the ti­tle con­ver­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>He paced his team with 20 points and pulled down 10 re­bounds, while team­mate An­thony Davis added 14 points. But Los An­ge­les had their worst shoot­ing per­for­mance of the term, hit­ting 35.8 per cent from the floor and mak­ing just 29 of 82 shots.</p>
    <p>Toronto put on a smoth­er­ing de­fen­sive dis­play, hold­ing the Lak­ers to just 25 per cent or 10-for-40 from three-point range, while on the of­fen­sive end, Kyle Lowry led all scor­ers with 33 points to leave James thor­oughly im­pressed.</p>
    <p>The three-time NBA cham­pion, who is hop­ing to lead his team to</p>
    <p>Se­ri­ously man, we love to play the games and we like to com­pete. We know we’re tough to beat, we re­ally do, and there’s a ceil­ing we can get to yet. ’’</p>
    <p>NICK NURSE, coach of the NBA ti­tle hold­ers Toronto Rap­tors, on his of­ten un­der-rated side.</p>
    <p>their first cham­pi­onship since 2010, said of the Rap­tors: “It’s a great team.</p>
    <p>“They won a cham­pi­onship for a rea­son. It wasn’t just all solely be­cause of Kawhi (Leonard) and ob­vi­ously, you see that.</p>
    <p>“They’ve got the two-headed mon­sters in Fred (VanVleet) and Kyle that set the tone. Their wings are ex­tremely good in Pas­cal (Si­akam) and OG (Anunoby).</p>
    <p>“They’ve got ex­pe­ri­ence in the front court at the cen­tre po­si­tion in Marc (Ga­sol) and Serge (Ibaka) and then they’ve got a bunch of com­ple­men­tary guys. That’s why they’ve been the team they’ve been all year.”</p>
    <p>The for­ward also told ESPN: “No ifs, ands or buts. Ex­cep­tion­ally well-coached and cham­pi­onship DNA, you can never take that away from a ball club if you win a cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>“And even be­fore that, they just got play­off-tested guys. The me­dia may not give them as much credit be­cause Kawhi is gone, but play­ers know what type of team they are.”</p>
    <p>VanVleet, who scored 13 points, told ca­ble chan­nel The Sports Net­work his team­mates had a chuckle af­ter crit­ics dis­counted them as a middle-of-the-pack team fol­low­ing Leonard’s de­par­ture to the Los An­ge­les Clip­pers.</p>
    <p>“It was al­most laugh­able for us,” he said. “We’re not used to get­ting pats on the back or flow­ers so it’s not re­ally that dif­fer­ent for us.”</p>
    <p>The un­der­dogs tag steeled their men­tal­ity dur­ing last sea­son’s cham­pi­onship run and they are rel­ish­ing fly­ing un­der the radar again ahead of the post-sea­son later this month.</p>
    <p>“Se­ri­ously man, we love to play the games and we like to com­pete,” said Rap­tors coach Nick Nurse, whose team are se­cond in the Eastern Con­fer­ence, trail­ing only the Bucks (54-12) with a 47-18 record.</p>
    <p>“We know we’re tough to beat, we re­ally do, and there’s a ceil­ing we can get to yet.”</p>
    <p>In the other key games of the day, Paul Ge­orge con­trib­uted 28 points and Leonard added 24 as the Clip­pers de­feated the New Or­leans Pelicans 126-103, while T.J. War­ren scored 53 points to power the In­di­ana Pac­ers to a 127-121 vic­tory over the Philadelph­ia 76ers.</p>
