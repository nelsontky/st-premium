    <p>No one will de­lib­er­ately plan to fail, but the fail­ure to do any plan­ning can re­sult in sim­i­larly bad or even worse out­comes.</p>
    <p>That is the view of Mr Al­fred Chia, chief ex­ec­u­tive of fi­nan­cial ad­vi­sory firm SingCap­i­tal, who has en­coun­tered many peo­ple of late who find them­selves short of money now be­cause they ne­glected to plan dur­ing the good times be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic hit.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple tend to over­spend and splurge on them­selves when times are bet­ter,” noted Mr Chia, who was speak­ing at the first askST@NLB vir­tual ses­sion, which of­fered ad­vice on how to man­age one’s money bet­ter dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“But we should al­ways re­mem­ber not to overdo it or you will end up spend­ing money that is meant to help your­self in the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>The ses­sion from the monthly video se­ries, which is sup­ported by the Na­tional Li­brary Board, was aired on The Straits Times Face­book page on Friday.</p>
    <p>You can still watch the askST video at str.sg/askstnlb</p>
    <p>Mr Chia, who is also the pres­i­dent of the Fi­nan­cial Plan­ning As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore, says more peo­ple are com­ing to his firm for ad­vice dur­ing the pan­demic, with quite a num­ber feel­ing very stressed over their predica­ment.</p>
    <p>“Some of them have high credit card debts that were chalked up months ear­lier, so the cur­rent down­turn makes it worse for them,” he says.</p>
    <p>The prob­lems hit­ting their in­comes are all too fa­mil­iar by now.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness own­ers have far fewer cus­tomers, which means a dras­tic drop in rev­enue, while those em­ployed face salary cuts or re­trench­ment.</p>
    <p>There are also those who bought in­vest­ment prop­erty but failed to find tenants, while oth­ers can­not col­lect enough rent to meet mort­gage pay­ments.</p>
    <p>Mr Chia says there are some prac­ti­cal steps for peo­ple strapped for cash.</p>
    <p>RALLY THE FAMILY FOR SUP­PORT</p>
    <p>Bad times can some­times bring family mem­bers closer to­gether.</p>
    <p>There is no point brood­ing over things that are be­yond one’s con­trol. So fam­i­lies should be pos­i­tive and work to­gether as a team to see how they can cut non-es­sen­tial house­hold ex­penses.</p>
    <p>They can dis­cuss ways to cope with less money, such as look­ing for cheaper al­ter­na­tives for daily ne­ces­si­ties such as food, and take on part-time jobs if pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>USE PROP­ERTY FOR EXTRA CASH</p>
    <p>If you have a spare room, con­sider rent­ing it out.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, there is a de­mand for short- to mid-term af­ford­able ac­com­mo­da­tion among Malaysian work­ers and even stu­dents, due to tighter move­ment con­trols.</p>
    <p>Hous­ing Board flat own­ers who are 65 and above can take up the Lease Buy­back Scheme and sell part of their leases to boost their monthly pay­outs from Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) Life and have more cash to spend.</p>
    <p>DE­FER PAY­MENTS FOR LOANS</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 re­lief schemes al­low peo­ple with monthly re­pay­ments for loans and in­surance poli­cies to ap­ply to put pay­ments on hold un­til the end of the year.</p>
    <p>This will not re­duce your debt obli­ga­tions but it will ease the cash flow while you get back onto a firmer fi­nan­cial foot­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Chia out­lines how these tips have helped fam­i­lies who came to him re­cently.</p>
    <p>To pro­tect their pri­vacy, he has used pseu­do­nyms for his clients.</p>
    <p>A YOUNG GRAD­U­ATE’S HOPE</p>
    <p>John has al­ways wanted to work for an air­line, so when he grad­u­ated from a lo­cal univer­sity re­cently, he ap­plied for a job in the avi­a­tion sec­tor. But air­lines have been hit hard by global travel re­stric­tions and he could not find a job.</p>
    <p>To make mat­ters worse, both his par­ents have also lost their jobs and the family still has a mort­gage on their HDB flat.</p>
    <p>John wants to help but has his own study loan to worry about.</p>
    <p>Mr Chia got the family to ap­ply for Covid-19 help.</p>
    <p>They qual­i­fied for the Covid-19 Sup­port Grant for those who have lost their jobs – $800 a month for three months – a sub­sidised com­puter and free home broad­band for up to three years.</p>
    <p>Mr Chia also helped them ap­ply for a de­fer­ment of loan re­pay­ments.</p>
    <p>RICH IN GOOD TIMES, POOR IN BAD TIMES</p>
    <p>Henry owned a flour­ish­ing busi­ness that gave him a good in­come.</p>
    <p>It al­lowed him to be very gen­er­ous with his money, of­ten treat­ing clients to ex­pen­sive meals.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, there was no rea­son why his con­struc­tion busi­ness would fail. Then, the pan­demic struck and af­fected his com­pany badly.</p>
    <p>He could not col­lect money owed to him as his clients were also in trou­ble, so he could not re­pay his credit card debts, which be­gan to pile up.</p>
    <p>He ap­plied for a tem­po­rary bridg­ing loan for his busi­ness, but was knocked back due to that huge credit card debt.</p>
    <p>Henry ap­proached Mr Chia re­cently as he did not want to be made a bank­rupt.</p>
    <p>Mr Chia helped him to pri­ori­tise his ex­penses, with the main fo­cus on clear­ing his credit card debt.</p>
    <p>He also helped the busi­ness­man ap­ply for the Pro­duc­tiv­ity Solutions Grant, which sup­ports com­pa­nies keen on adopt­ing IT solutions and equip­ment.</p>
    <p>Henry also sur­ren­dered his en­dow­ment plan to re­duce his debt.</p>
    <p>“He will need at least three to five years, de­pend­ing on his dis­ci­pline, to work on his fi­nan­cial sit­u­a­tion,” notes Mr Chia.</p>
    <p>“The pan­demic truly gives us an im­por­tant les­son that we can­not take things for granted and that we must re­ally plan for a rainy day and for re­tire­ment.”</p>
