    <p>WELLING­TON • All Blacks coach Ian Fos­ter has joined in the broad­sides be­ing fired back and forth across the Tas­man Sea about the fu­ture of Su­per Rugby by warn­ing that any re­vamped com­pe­ti­tion needed to be com­pet­i­tive and fi­nan­cially vi­able.</p>
    <p>New Zealand Rugby is poised to re­lease its pre­ferred com­pe­ti­tion for­mat this week, with just a tran­sTas­man struc­ture in­volv­ing at least eight teams ex­pected to be un­veiled.</p>
    <p>Rugby Aus­tralia, how­ever, has said it is an­noyed the for­mat would in­clude the five ex­ist­ing New Zealand teams and have just two or three Aus­tralian sides.</p>
    <p>But Fos­ter said the com­pe­ti­tion needed to be rel­e­vant to play­ers and fans.</p>
    <p>“This is not a char­ity. We’ve got to ac­tu­ally make sure they’re fea­si­ble, they’re fi­nan­cially vi­able and the pub­lic are go­ing to re­ally get in be­hind them,” he told NewsHub, speak­ing about lim­it­ing the num­ber of Aus­tralian sides.</p>
    <p>“We’ve seen in the past that if you let in teams that ac­tu­ally can’t sur­vive, then you’ve got to keep chang­ing the com­pe­ti­tion around.”</p>
    <p>The war of words be­tween the two coun­tries over the com­pe­ti­tion’s fu­ture has been ratch­eted up in the last week with var­i­ous cur­rent and for­mer of­fi­cials voic­ing their opin­ions.</p>
    <p>One of the big­gest con­cerns in New Zealand has been the strength of Aus­tralian teams.</p>
    <p>Su­per Rugby sides in Aus­tralia have not chal­lenged for the ti­tle since the New South Wales</p>
    <p>Waratahs won the com­pe­ti­tion in 2014. The only Aus­tralian teams to make the play-offs since 2016 have been the do­mes­tic con­fer­ence win­ners.</p>
    <p>New Zealand sides have also dom­i­nated their Aus­tralian coun­ter­parts, with one win­ning streak last­ing 40 games and more than two years.</p>
    <p>“We’ve got to do what­ever we can to get com­pet­i­tive teams against our teams,” Fos­ter added.</p>
    <p>“We’re pretty se­cure in our five (teams), so once they (Aus­tralia) get their num­ber, I guess we sit around and have a con­ver­sa­tion.”</p>
    <p>His thoughts were shared by for­mer All Blacks greats Mils Mu­li­aina and John Kir­wan.</p>
    <p>The duo pub­licly backed a nineteam com­pe­ti­tion, one that fea­tures three teams from Aus­tralia and one from the Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>Mu­li­aina said that a fourth Aus­tralian team could be added to the com­pe­ti­tion if the de­ci­sion could be jus­ti­fied by “player strength and a ro­bust bot­tom line”.</p>
