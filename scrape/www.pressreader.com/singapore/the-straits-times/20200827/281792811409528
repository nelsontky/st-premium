    <p>US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo praised Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s “Amer­ica First” for­eign pol­icy, in­clud­ing his tough stance on China and ne­go­ti­a­tions with North Korea, back­ing Mr Trump’s re-elec­tion in an un­usual speech at the Repub­li­can Na­tional Con­ven­tion (RNC) on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo was the first sit­ting US sec­re­tary of state to ad­dress a na­tional party con­ven­tion in at least 75 years, break­ing with a long­stand­ing tra­di­tion of sec­re­taries of state stay­ing out of do­mes­tic pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>The four-minute video mes­sage was pre-recorded dur­ing Mr Pom­peo’s on­go­ing of­fi­cial visit to the Mid­dle East, and aired on the sec­ond day of the RNC.</p>
    <p>Stand­ing against a scenic back­drop of the Old City in Jerusalem, he said that Mr Trump had made Amer­i­cans safer and their free­doms more se­cure by putting his Amer­ica First vi­sion into ac­tion.</p>
    <p>“This Pres­i­dent has led bold ini­tia­tives in nearly ev­ery cor­ner of the world,” said Mr Pom­peo, high­light­ing Mr Trump’s hard­line stance against China, his with­drawal from a nu­clear deal with Iran and his seal­ing of a peace deal be­tween Is­rael and the United Arab Emi­rates two weeks ago.</p>
    <p>“In China, he’s pulled back the cur­tain on the preda­tory ag­gres­sion of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist</p>
    <p>Party. The Pres­i­dent has held China ac­count­able for cov­er­ing up the China virus and al­low­ing it to spread death and eco­nomic de­struc­tion in Amer­ica and around the world, and he will not rest un­til jus­tice is done.</p>
    <p>“He’s ended the ridicu­lously un­fair trade ar­range­ment with China that punched a hole in our econ­omy. Those jobs, those jobs are com­ing back home,” said Mr Pom­peo, in a nod to the phase one trade deal that marked a cease­fire in the tit-for-tat trade war be­tween the world’s two big­gest economies.</p>
    <p>Un­der Mr Trump’s pres­i­dency, ten­sions be­tween the United States and China have risen sharply as their strate­gic ri­valry deep­ened, with both pow­ers clash­ing on ev­ery­thing from trade to tech­nol­ogy to China’s han­dling of the ini­tial Covid-19 out­break in Wuhan.</p>
    <p>China has emerged as a US elec­tion is­sue, with Mr Trump and his Demo­cratic op­po­nent Joe Bi­den seek­ing to por­tray the other as weak on China.</p>
    <p>The Bi­den cam­paign’s se­nior for­eign pol­icy ad­viser Antony Blinken re­sponded to Mr Pom­peo’s speech, dis­put­ing his por­trayal of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s record.</p>
    <p>“In fact, when China’s gov­ern­ment with­held vi­tal in­for­ma­tion about the virus and denied ac­cess to in­ter­na­tional ex­perts, Pres­i­dent Trump spent nearly two months prais­ing its co­op­er­a­tion and trans­parency to pro­tect his empty trade deal. No speech can erase that his­tory,” said Mr Blinken, who was deputy sec­re­tary of state un­der for­mer pres­i­dent Barack Obama.</p>
    <p>In his speech, Mr Pom­peo also said Mr Trump had “low­ered the tem­per­a­ture” on North Korea, prais­ing him for get­ting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to come to the ta­ble at three his­toric sum­mits.</p>
    <p>Turn­ing to the Mid­dle East and Europe, Mr Pom­peo said Mr Trump had strength­ened the North At­lantic Treaty Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>“The Pres­i­dent moved the US Em­bassy to this very city of God, Jerusalem, the right­ful cap­i­tal of the Jewish home­land,” said Mr Pom­peo, shin­ing the spot­light on a move that ap­pealed to evan­gel­i­cal Chris­tians, a solid core of Mr Trump’s base.</p>
    <p>He did not di­rectly urge view­ers to vote for Mr Trump, nor did he crit­i­cise Mr Bi­den by name. But he said: “The way each of us can best en­sure our free­dom is by elect­ing lead­ers that don’t just talk, but de­liver.”</p>
    <p>His speech at the RNC was con­tro­ver­sial, with ob­servers re­mark­ing that it ap­peared to run counter to his own re­minder to diplo­mats last month not to en­gage in par­ti­san po­lit­i­cal ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>The State De­part­ment said its re­sources were not used and Mr Pom­peo spoke in his per­sonal ca­pac­ity, but House Democrats said they would in­ves­ti­gate whether the speech vi­o­lated fed­eral law.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump will of­fi­cially ac­cept the Repub­li­can Party’s nom­i­na­tion to run for pres­i­dent at the four-day RNC’s fi­nale to­day.</p>
