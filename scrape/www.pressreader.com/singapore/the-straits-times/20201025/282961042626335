    <p>Among the core de­mands of the thou­sands of pro-democ­racy protesters who have taken to the streets of Thai­land since mid-July is one that was pre­vi­ously un­think­able.</p>
    <p>They are ap­peal­ing for the res­ig­na­tion of Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha and amend­ments to the Con­sti­tu­tion, but it is the most re­cent de­mand that is per­haps the most sig­nif­i­cant: The protesters want the monar­chy to be re­formed and the pow­ers of 68-year-old King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn curbed.</p>
    <p>By openly chal­leng­ing the monarch, who was for­mally crowned last year, the protesters have broken a taboo in a king­dom with one of the strictest lese ma­jeste laws in the world – in­sult­ing the royal fam­ily can carry a jail term of up to 15 years.</p>
    <p>“With the ge­nie out of the bot­tle, it could lead to more over­sight and lim­its on the in­sti­tu­tion’s power, though there is strong ob­jec­tion and push­back from staunch roy­al­ists, in­clud­ing the Prime Min­is­ter,” says Mr Jay Har­ri­man, se­nior di­rec­tor at strate­gic ad­vi­sory firm Bower Group Asia, not­ing that re­cent protests are the largest since the 2014 coup where the Thai mil­i­tary led by for­mer j unta l eader, Mr Prayut, seized power.</p>
    <p>The late King Bhu­mi­bol Adulyadej was revered as a demigod and had great in­flu­ence within Thai so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Since as­cend­ing the throne in 2016, months af­ter the death of his fa­ther, King Bhu­mi­bol, King Va­ji­ra­longkorn has sought to in­crease his di­rect con­trol over the coun­try’s in­sti­tu­tions and pub­lic as­sets.</p>
    <p>King Va­ji­ra­longkorn has con­sol­i­dated his power by tak­ing per­sonal con­trol of the multi­bil­lion-dol­lar as­sets of the Crown Prop­erty Bureau and two army units.</p>
    <p>He also di­rected the gov­ern­ment to re­write parts of the Con­sti­tu­tion that touched on the role of the king, in­clud­ing the need to ap­point a re­gent in the king’s ab­sence.</p>
    <p>This comes as for­eign news out­lets have put out nu­mer­ous reports about the King’s ab­sence from Thai­land. He spends most of his time abroad, es­pe­cially i n Ger­many, where he keeps a home.</p>
    <p>Some of the monarch’s moves have been seen as con­tro­ver­sial by crit­ics as, of­fi­cially, Thai­land is a con­sti­tu­tional monar­chy and the roy­als are sup­posed to be po­lit­i­cally neu­tral or above pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>But protesters have ac­cused the monar­chy of en­abling years of mil­i­tary dom­i­na­tion and wanted to curb the King’s pow­ers.</p>
    <p>STU­DENT SEN­TI­MENTS</p>
    <p>The cur­rent stu­dent-led move­ment, com­pris­ing mostly those from Gen­er­a­tion Z and late mil­len­ni­als, dif­fers from protests of pre­vi­ous times, an­a­lysts tell The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ous demon­stra­tions were led by op­po­si­tion politi­cians, ac­tivists and farm­ers and rarely touched on the state or the role of the royal in­sti­tu­tion, says Dr Ayako Toyama from the Grad­u­ate School of Hu­man­i­ties and So­cial Sciences at the Univer­sity of Tsukuba in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>“(This time), most of the par­tic­i­pants are young stu­dents,” she says. “Stu­dents’ re­form de­mands are more pure and ide­al­is­tic than past demon­stra­tions’, which makes it dif­fi­cult for gov­ern­ments to deny demon­stra­tions.</p>
    <p>“This is the first time that such a straight­for­ward ref­er­ence has been made to royal re­form, and many adults are sur­prised.”</p>
    <p>Dr Toyama also says this seg­ment of the pop­u­la­tion might be less rev­er­ent to­wards the monar­chy and mil­i­tary. Frus­tra­tion may be build­ing as there could be per­cep­tions that the pro-mil­i­tary gov­ern­ment has failed to ef­fec­tively ad­dress the eco­nomic prob­lems as­so­ci­ated with the coro­n­avirus pandemic.</p>
    <p>Not ex­empt from the Covid-19 shocks plagu­ing economies world­wide, Thai­land’s econ­omy – South­east Asia’s sec­ond largest – is re­port­edly ex­pected to shrink a record 7 per cent-plus this year.</p>
    <p>The protests are also about the stu­dents’ lost fu­ture, says Dr Thiti­nan Pong­sud­hi­rak, a po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist from Chu­la­longkorn Univer­sity in Thai­land.</p>
    <p>Last month, he wrote in a Straits Times opin­ion piece that “the stu­dent gen­er­a­tion is now chal­leng­ing the sta­tus quo right down to its foun­da­tions, de­mand­ing re­forms even of the once-un­touch­able monar­chy to be­come more trans­par­ent and ac­count­able, and for the en­tire po­lit­i­cal system to be an­swer­able to the pop­u­lar will”.</p>
    <p>SPEAK­ING FRANKLY</p>
    <p>The stu­dents also ap­pear to be un­afraid of the lese ma­jeste laws, says Pro­fes­sor James Chin, di­rec­tor of the Asia In­sti­tute at the Univer­sity of Tas­ma­nia.</p>
    <p>“In terms of the im­pact on the monar­chy, it shows that younger peo­ple have less re­spect for (it).”</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, dur­ing a protest gath­er­ing, human rights lawyer Arnon Nampa, 36, who has been at the fore­front of the move­ment, made un­prece­dented frank and pub­lic com­ments call­ing for re­form of the monar­chy, en­cour­ag­ing oth­ers to speak “frankly” about the topic.</p>
    <p>With such strong calls, an­a­lysts agree that it will be dif­fi­cult for King Va­ji­ra­longkorn to play a me­di­at­ing role in the cur­rent tur­moil as his fa­ther, King Bhu­mi­bol, did dur­ing pre­vi­ous crises.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause the royal in­sti­tu­tion has be­come a di­rect target of the protesters’ de­mands, says Bower Group Asia’s Mr Har­ri­man.</p>
    <p>“We’re un­likely to see a sim­i­lar scene as in 1992 when, on na­tional TV, the King ended the po­lit­i­cal cri­sis by telling op­pos­ing lead­ers, pros­trat­ing on the ground, to bring an end to their vi­o­lence,” he says in ref­er­ence to King Bhu­mi­bol, who helped me­di­ate when gov­ern­ment forces and pro-democ­racy protesters clashed.</p>
    <p>On that May 20 night, King Bhu­mi­bol ap­peared on na­tional broad­casts and in­ter­ceded be­tween the lead­ers of the two ri­val groups who were both seated at his feet, even­tu­ally calm­ing the tense sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to the cur­rent King, Dr Paul Cham­bers of Nare­suan Univer­sity’s Cen­tre of Asean Com­mu­nity Stud­ies says: “If he wants to pre­serve the power of monar­chy in Thai­land, it might help if he in­volves him­self in the prob­lems of Thai­land more fre­quently and vis­i­bly, us­ing his fa­ther as a model.”</p>
    <p>TEN­SIONS ES­CA­LAT­ING</p>
    <p>While t he protests have been largely peace­ful, ten­sions have es­ca­lated fol­low­ing the ar­rests of key protest lead­ers as well as the dec­la­ra­tion of a state of “se­ri­ous emer­gency” in Bangkok dur­ing which wa­ter can­non were used to dis­perse demon­stra­tors.</p>
    <p>At­tempts were made to shut down me­dia out­lets that ap­peared sym­pa­thetic to protesters, as well as re­strict the mes­sag­ing app Telegram used by them.</p>
    <p>How­ever, protesters have con­tin­ued to rally in Bangkok and across Thai­land, de­fy­ing re­stric­tions that ban pub­lic gath­er­ings of five or more peo­ple, and which give se­cu­rity forces broader pow­ers.</p>
    <p>But even with pres­sure mount­ing to curb the monarch’s in­flu­ence, Univer­sity of Tas­ma­nia’s Prof Chin says it is un­likely that the King will agree to the de­mands for change.</p>
    <p>He says: “(He) will not give in be­cause he just re­cently con­sol­i­dated his power, so he won’t ac­cept any moves to ac­cede to con­sti­tu­tional amend­ments.”</p>
    <p>King Va­ji­ra­longkorn has so far made no di­rect com­ment on the three months of protests, but on Oct 16 he ap­peared on state tele­vi­sion, say­ing the coun­try needed peo­ple who loved the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>Thai roy­al­ists have also taken to the streets and so­cial me­dia in at­tempts to counter the anti-monar­chy protesters.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Prayut has said he will not re­sign and, last Thursday, the gov­ern­ment or­dered the re­moval of emer­gency mea­sures put in place a week ear­lier.</p>
    <p>The Thai Par­lia­ment will also hold a spe­cial ses­sion to dis­cuss the de­mands of pro-democ­racy protesters. The two-day sit­ting is ex­pected to take place to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Chu­la­longkorn Univer­sity’s Dr Thiti­nan tells The Sun­day Times that the move might be a “time-buy­ing tac­tic” and that the ses­sion is un­likely to achieve much as a third of Par­lia­ment is still com­prised of the mil­i­tary Se­nate.</p>
    <p>Of the var­i­ous de­mands, the res­ig­na­tion of the Prime Min­is­ter seems the most “work­able”, although it is al­ready a huge de­mand, says Dr Thiti­nan, adding: “Un­less Prayut re­signs, no amount of change is likely to sat­isfy the stu­dent-led protest move­ment.</p>
    <p>“From the gov­ern­ment’s side, there will be re­luc­tance to give in to any de­mand, be­cause this will lead to a slip­pery slope. It’s a face-off to see who is go­ing to budge first.”</p>
