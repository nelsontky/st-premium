    <p>Citi will open its largest wealth ad­vi­sory hub in Or­chard in De­cem­ber as it tar­gets an in­crease in its mar­ket share of ca­ter­ing to the well-heeled. The Citi Wealth Hub will house more than 30 client ad­vi­sory rooms and cater to Cit­igold and Cit­igold Pri­vate Client cus­tomers, said the bank yesterday.</p>
    <p>Citi will open its largest wealth ad­vi­sory hub at 268 Or­chard Road in De­cem­ber as it tar­gets an in­crease in its mar­ket share of ca­ter­ing to the well-heeled.</p>
    <p>The Citi Wealth Hub at 268 Or­chard will oc­cupy an area of 30,000 sq ft across four floors.</p>
    <p>The 268 Or­chard site is where the for­mer Yen San Build­ing stood – and co­in­ci­den­tally, Citibank pre­vi­ously had a branch there.</p>
    <p>The wealth hub will house more than 30 client ad­vi­sory rooms and cater to Cit­igold and Cit­igold Pri­vate Client cus­tomers, said the bank yesterday.</p>
    <p>Cit­igold is the bank’s wealth man­age­ment ser­vice for cus­tomers with at least $250,000 in in­vestible as­sets.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that the in­vest­ment in the hub is in the “dou­ble-digit mil­lions”.</p>
    <p>About 300 re­la­tion­ship man­agers, ad­vis­ers, spe­cial­ists and staff will move from the bank’s ex­ist­ing branches to the hub when it opens.</p>
    <p>The bank has 12 branches in Sin­ga­pore, down from 14 at the start of the year. It said that close to 90 per cent of its re­tail bank­ing cus­tomers use dig­i­tal plat­forms for their daily bank­ing needs, and less than 1 per cent of trans­ac­tions take place in Citi branches.</p>
    <p>It added that the hub will al­low Citibank Sin­ga­pore to have deeper con­ver­sa­tions about wealth with cus­tomers while serv­ing their sim­ple trans­ac­tion needs dig­i­tally. Clients can meet their re­la­tion­ship man­agers and have ac­cess to a team of spe­cial­ists at a cen­tral lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The hub will also have fa­cil­i­ties to host in­vest­ment sem­i­nars and events for clients.</p>
    <p>Mr Bren­dan Car­ney, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Citibank Sin­ga­pore and head of con­sumer bank­ing for Citi in Asean, said: “We see a great op­por­tu­nity for us to serve the grow­ing af­flu­ent seg­ment in Sin­ga­pore... As we con­tinue to grow our busi­ness, we will look to open more of such hubs in the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>The bank said it aims to achieve dou­ble-digit growth in mar­ket share and num­ber of clients in the wealth seg­ment in the next few years.</p>
    <p>The hub will have a bio­philic de­sign and will aim to be cer­ti­fied as a green build­ing. Bio­philic de­sign is based on the idea that hu­mans have an in­her­ent need to con­nect with na­ture, even in modern set­tings.</p>
    <p>Client meet­ing rooms will be named after na­tional flow­ers and trees found in places where Citi has a pres­ence, with some rooms trans­formed into “gar­den pods”.</p>
    <p>An an­timi­cro­bial coat­ing will be ap­plied on all high-touch sur­faces, and safe dis­tanc­ing of at least 2m will be en­forced. All rooms will be dis­in­fected after each use, and plexi-guard shields will be in­stalled as a pre­cau­tion against the trans­mis­sion of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The United States bank is among sev­eral play­ers in the wealth man­age­ment scene here. HSBC in March launched a new global busi­ness – wealth and per­sonal bank­ing – that com­bines re­tail bank­ing, wealth man­age­ment and global pri­vate bank­ing. It is in the midst of re­cruit­ment for wealth teams in Sin­ga­pore, China and Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>As for lo­cal banks, United Over­seas Bank last year launched its first high-street wealth bank­ing branch at Faber House in Or­chard Road to com­ple­ment its on­line chan­nels in a bid to bet­ter equip “emerg­ing af­flu­ent” cus­tomers with in­vest­ment knowl­edge. It de­fines this group as those aged be­tween 25 and 44, with be­tween $100,000 and $350,000 in in­vestible as­sets.</p>
    <p>DBS Wealth Man­age­ment com­prises three client seg­ments – Trea­sures, Trea­sures Pri­vate Client and Pri­vate Bank – for cus­tomers with in­vestible as­sets rang­ing from $350,000 to $5 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>OCBC Premier Bank­ing and Premier Pri­vate Client of­fer cus­tomers ac­cess to 13 premier bank­ing cen­tres here, and in­vest­ment ad­vi­sory ser­vices from the OCBC Wealth Panel, which has ex­perts from across the group’s units.</p>
