    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi’s party’s prom­ise of free Covid-19 vac­cines for poll-bound Bi­har state has not only been called out for be­ing an elec­tion ploy, but has also trig­gered a de­mand for free vac­cines for the en­tire coun­try of 1.35 bil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The states of Tamil Nadu and Mad­hya Pradesh have also said they will pro­vide vac­cines free of charge to res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>While the fed­eral gov­ern­ment has not an­nounced any of­fi­cial plans, at least one fed­eral min­is­ter, Mr Pratap Sarangi, has said ev­ery­one will get a vac­cine for free, when one is avail­able.</p>
    <p>Mr Adar Poon­awalla, head of the Serum In­sti­tute of In­dia, which has been cho­sen by Ox­ford Univer­sity and As­traZeneca to man­u­fac­ture their vac­cine, es­ti­mates it will cost 800 bil­lion ru­pees (S$14.7 bil­lion) to vac­ci­nate the whole coun­try.</p>
    <p>Ques­tions have popped up over the eco­nomics of promis­ing free vac­cines, with vac­cine costs un­known and al­ready over­bur­dened ex­che­quers hit by the pan­demic. Many be­lieve those who can pay should be made to pay.</p>
    <p>The In­dian econ­omy con­tracted 23.9 per cent in the first quar­ter of this year af­ter all eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity was shut down in March in re­sponse to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a re­cent Re­serve Bank of In­dia study, states are ex­pected to see their fis­cal deficit hit 4.6 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) – dou­ble what they had bud­geted for the year pre-pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“It’s go­ing to be a huge bur­den (on the ex­che­quer) un­less there is some at­tempt to force com­pa­nies to lower prices,” said trade econ­o­mist Biswa­jit Dhar, a pro­fes­sor at Jawa­har­lal Nehru Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>There is also con­cern over whether there will be an eq­ui­table distri­bu­tion of any vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Mr Dhar said: “The gov­ern­ment has been talk­ing about a phased in­tro­duc­tion of this vac­cine. But when the vac­cine comes to the mar­ket, in­flu­en­tial peo­ple will pay what­ever and get ac­cess. There is a big gap be­tween the an­nounce­ment and im­ple­men­ta­tion.”</p>
    <p>Mr A.K. Shiva Ku­mar, an in­ter­na­tional devel­op­ment econ­o­mist and pol­icy ad­viser, said the In­dian gov­ern­ment and the global com­mu­nity would need “to en­gage with vac­cine man­u­fac­tur­ers to en­sure that patent laws are not used to cre­ate mo­nop­oly power, prices are reg­u­lated to of­fer the right in­cen­tives to man­u­fac­tur­ers, and vac­cines are mass pro­duced and made avail­able free of cost to the pop­u­la­tion”.</p>
    <p>In­dia, with over eight mil­lion cases, has the se­cond-high­est num­ber of cases in the world af­ter the United States, which has nearly nine mil­lion.</p>
    <p>In­dia has seen a down­ward trend in daily new cases but that is tem­pered by con­cern over the on­go­ing fes­ti­val sea­son, where large gath­er­ings are the norm.</p>
    <p>Still, many have wel­comed the idea of free vac­cines for all.</p>
    <p>Mr Nitin Pai, co-founder and direc­tor of the Tak­shashila In­sti­tu­tion, an in­de­pen­dent cen­tre for re­search and ed­u­ca­tion in public pol­icy, ar­gued that pro­tect­ing the health of the pop­u­la­tion would bring ad­e­quate eco­nomic re­turns.</p>
    <p>“De­spite the fis­cal con­straints, the In­dian gov­ern­ment can ad­e­quately fi­nance the 0.4 per cent of GDP re­quired for a na­tional vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme,” said Mr Pai.</p>
    <p>“Be­sides, if the pro­gramme boosts eco­nomic growth by a cou­ple of points, the higher tax rev­enues alone will jus­tify the public ex­pense.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ku­mar, too, noted: “All gov­ern­ments have a moral obli­ga­tion to en­sure that life-sav­ing vac­cines are pro­vided free to the en­tire pop­u­la­tion. So does In­dia.”</p>
    <p>But the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) pledge of free vac­cines as Bi­har headed to the polls last Wed­nes­day has got the op­po­si­tion see­ing red about public health be­ing tied to pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>The BJP has coun­tered the crit­i­cism, say­ing all state gov­ern­ments were free to make sim­i­lar an­nounce­ments and that the prom­ise showed the im­por­tance given to health­care.</p>
    <p>Con­gress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted on Oct 22: “GOI (Gov­ern­ment of In­dia) just an­nounced In­dia’s Covid ac­cess strat­egy.</p>
    <p>“Kindly re­fer to the state-wise elec­tion sched­ule to know when will you get it, along with a hoard of false prom­ises.”</p>
