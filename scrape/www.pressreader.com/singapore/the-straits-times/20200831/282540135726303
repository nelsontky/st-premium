    <p>English singer­song­writer Liam Payne is now en­gaged to Amer­i­can model Maya Henry (both right), ac­cord­ing to Bri­tish tabloid The Daily Mail.</p>
    <p>A mem­ber of boy band One Direc­tion, Payne – who re­cently turned 27 – re­port­edly pro­posed to Henry, 20, dur­ing wide­spread lock­downs in Bri­tain due to the Covid-19 pan­demic. He had popped the ques­tion with a ring that The Daily Mail es­ti­mates to be around £3 mil­lion (S$5.44 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>The couple were seen leav­ing a Lon­don restau­rant last Thurs­day with Henry sport­ing a huge di­a­mond ring on her left hand.</p>
    <p>The model, who is the daugh­ter of mil­lion­aire Texan lawyer Thomas J. Henry, re­port­edly first met Payne as a One Direc­tion fan dur­ing a meet-and-greet event in 2015, when she was still a teenager.</p>
    <p>The two be­gan dat­ing in 2018, soon af­ter Payne split from English singer Ch­eryl, 37. The former couple met when Ch­eryl was a judge on re­al­ity se­ries The X Fac­tor in 2008 and Payne au­di­tioned for the show.</p>
    <p>They have a son Bear, aged three.</p>
    <p>Payne con­firmed his re­la­tion­ship with Henry in an In­sta­gram post only last year, when he posted their pic­ture and thanked her “for al­ways keep­ing the big­gest smile on (his) face”.</p>
    <p>Henry has also posted pho­tos of Payne on her In­sta­gram ac­count, with one show­ing the couple em­braced in a kiss.</p>
