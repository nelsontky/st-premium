    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) has spent half of the $8.8 bil­lion that it raised through its rights is­sues, as air­lines con­tinue to be bat­tered by the Covid-19 pan­demic that has paral­ysed air travel.</p>
    <p>Of the to­tal amount, $2.5 bil­lion has been used for one-off items.</p>
    <p>This com­prises $2 bil­lion to re­pay a bridge loan that was taken to tide the com­pany over from March to June un­til the pro­ceeds of the rights is­sues came through in early June.</p>
    <p>An­other $500 mil­lion was used to re­deem SIA’s 10-year bonds.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing $1.9 bil­lion was used for ticket re­funds and re­pay­ment of funds pre­vi­ously drawn un­der cer­tain lines of credit.</p>
    <p>It was also used to meet the com­pany’s op­er­at­ing and cap­i­tal ex­pen­di­ture in June and July, SIA said in an an­nounce­ment to the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>SIA raised the funds in June, after the Covid-19 out­break and re­sult­ing bor­der re­stric­tions emp­tied the skies and kept planes grounded.</p>
    <p>The air­line in­dus­try is un­likely to re­cover fully be­fore 2024, the In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion said last month.</p>
    <p>Since the start of the Covid-19 pan­demic, SIA has taken steps to sig­nif­i­cantly re­duce its monthly ex­pen­di­ture, a spokesman told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>These in­clude the de­fer­ral of non-es­sen­tial projects and dis­cus­sions with air­craft man­u­fac­tur­ers to de­fer the de­liv­ery of air­craft.</p>
    <p>“SIA has also cut the salary of all staff mem­bers, we have asked peo­ple to go on fur­lough and of­fered var­i­ous no-pay leave schemes, and we have in­tro­duced vol­un­tary early re­lease schemes”, he said.</p>
    <p>The air­line said: “We will con­tinue to pur­sue cost man­age­ment mea­sures and will also ex­plore ad­di­tional means to shore up our liq­uid­ity as nec­es­sary.”</p>
    <p>To curb costs, the Sin­ga­pore car­rier has slashed salaries and put staff on un­paid leave as it op­er­ates at less than 10 per cent of ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>SIA posted a first-half loss of $1.85 bil­lion as the pan­demic wiped out pas­sen­ger traf­fic. Cathay Pa­cific lost HK$9.9 bil­lion (S$1.78 bil­lion) and Qan­tas A$1.96 bil­lion (S$1.92 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this week, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat an­nounced that an ad­di­tional $187 mil­lion will be pumped into Sin­ga­pore’s avi­a­tion sec­tor, which in­cludes air­lines, ground han­dlers, cargo agents and air­port ten­ants.</p>
    <p>The SIA Group – which com­prises SIA, SilkAir and bud­get car­rier Scoot – has also re­ceived ap­proval for its pas­sen­gers from In­done­sia, Malaysia, Thai­land, Viet­nam and Cam­bo­dia to transit through Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The five coun­tries are the first from the re­gion whose pas­sen­gers the Civil Avi­a­tion Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore has al­lowed to transit here after bor­der re­stric­tions were slightly eased on June 2.</p>
    <p>SIA shares closed 0.28 per cent higher yes­ter­day at $3.63.</p>
