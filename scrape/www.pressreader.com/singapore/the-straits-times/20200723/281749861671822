    <p>Thai­land is plan­ning to ex­tend its state of emer­gency by one month to the end of Au­gust, the rea­son be­ing the need to ef­fec­tively con­trol the Covid-19 out­break as it grad­u­ally opens up its bor­ders.</p>
    <p>“It is nec­es­sary for us to open up our coun­try more… to re­vive the econ­omy,” said Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil sec­re­tary-gen­eral Som­sak Rungsita yesterday. “The only tool (we have) to deal with this tran­si­tion is the emer­gency de­cree.”</p>
    <p>He promised that the au­thor­i­ties will not use the de­cree to pro­hibit pub­lic gath­er­ings. This was said in re­sponse to pre­vi­ous al­le­ga­tions that the law was be­ing abused to con­trol grow­ing street protests against the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The Cab­i­net is ex­pected to ap­prove the ex­ten­sion next Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Thai­land has not recorded any lo­cal coro­n­avirus trans­mis­sion in two months but un­rest is grow­ing.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-ocha is over­see­ing a ten­u­ous Cab­i­net reshuf­fle after six min­is­ters re­signed in the past week amid up­heaval in the rul­ing Palang Pracharath Party. Among the min­is­ters who va­cated their seats were those helm­ing the Fi­nance, En­ergy and Labour min­istries.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, stu­dent-led protests have sprung up across the king­dom. Over 2,000 peo­ple gath­ered in Bangkok last Satur­day to de­mand that Par­lia­ment be dis­solved and the Con­sti­tu­tion amended.</p>
    <p>The Bangkok rally was Thai­land’s big­gest protest since March, when a state of emer­gency was im­posed, en­forc­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing and lim­it­ing large gath­er­ings. Smaller protests have also taken place in Chi­ang Mai and Ubon Ratchathan­i prov­inces and more are planned in sev­eral other prov­inces this week.</p>
    <p>Over the past two months, Bangkok has lifted its night cur­few and eased re­stric­tions on in­ter-pro­vin­cial travel to get its sput­ter­ing econ­omy back on track.</p>
    <p>But bor­der re­stric­tions re­main in place and have caused tourist ar­rivals to plunge. This is a key fac­tor in the cen­tral bank’s pro­jec­tion that the econ­omy will shrink by 8.1 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>De­spite the sag­ging econ­omy, the Thai pub­lic re­mains wary that for­eign ar­rivals may trig­ger a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions. Two fresh cases in­volv­ing for­eign­ers ex­empted from a state quar­an­tine caused a pub­lic up­roar a week ago and forced the gov­ern­ment to tighten con­trol over th­ese spe­cial ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>The first im­ported case was an Egyp­tian mil­i­tary of­fi­cer on a lay­over in Ray­ong prov­ince who vis­ited a shop­ping cen­tre there. The sec­ond was the daugh­ter of a Su­danese diplo­mat, who had trav­elled with her family to a Bangkok con­do­minium after land­ing in Thai­land.</p>
    <p>No in­fec­tions have been found so far among over 7,000 pos­si­bly ex­posed peo­ple who were tested.</p>
    <p>Th­ese lapses, how­ever, caused mass can­cel­la­tions of ho­tel book­ings in Ray­ong.</p>
    <p>Two peo­ple who held up protest plac­ards when Mr Prayut vis­ited Ray­ong last week were re­port­edly charged with vi­o­lat­ing the emer­gency de­cree.</p>
