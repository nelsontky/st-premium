    <p>At 4am, en­cir­cled by smoke from the var­i­ous wild­fires blazing through Cal­i­for­nia, renowned travel writer Pico Iyer turned on Zoom and beamed at more than 950 view­ers half a world away in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Iyer, 63, seemed chip­per given the early hour and the en­vi­ron­ment, es­pe­cially for some­one who, in 1990, watched his house burn in one of the worst man-made fires in Cal­i­for­nian his­tory.</p>
    <p>The house was sur­rounded by 25m-high flames, he re­called. From the road, he watched them sys­tem­at­i­cally burn through the liv­ing room and re­duce ev­ery­thing in his bed­room to ash, wip­ing out eight years’ worth of writ­ing for his next three books.</p>
    <p>If some­body had asked him then where his home was, he would have had noth­ing phys­i­cal to point to.</p>
    <p>“Home is not the place where you live,” he said. “Home is what lives in­side you. And I think these days, even some­body who’s got a very fixed sense of home has to have a global per­spec­tive.”</p>
    <p>Iyer was speak­ing on Tues­day night about lo­cal­ism and glob­al­ism as part of the Lien Fung’s Col­lo­quium se­ries, or­gan­ised by Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>“It’s im­pos­si­ble to have glob­al­ism with­out the lo­cal com­po­nent,” he said. “And it’s dan­ger­ous to have lo­cal­ism with­out global vi­sion.”</p>
    <p>Iyer, who is among the best-known travel writ­ers liv­ing to­day, has writ­ten more than a dozen books, in­clud­ing last year’s Au­tumn Light, A Begin­ner’s Guide To Ja­pan and This Could Be Home, about Sin­ga­pore’s Raf­fles Ho­tel.</p>
    <p>In the we­bi­nar, he spoke of his own back­ground as an “in­ter­na­tional co-pro­duc­tion” who tran­scends bor­ders. Born to In­dian par­ents in Bri­tain, he di­vides his time be­tween the United States and Ja­pan, where he lives with his wife Hiroko Takeuchi and two chil­dren.</p>
    <p>He sees not be­long­ing to any one tribe – and its at­ten­dant loy­al­ties and en­mi­ties – as a “great lib­er­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>“Some­body like me can in some ways be de­fined not by my pass­port, but by my pas­sions,” he said. “Home doesn’t have to be the place that you come from. Home can be the place where you go. In all kinds of ways, I think this frees us from some of the prob­lems of yes­ter­year.</p>
    <p>“In my case, home be­came al­most a col­lage, a stained-glass hall to which I was con­stantly adding new el­e­ments and try­ing to keep them in har­mony. Home be­came a sen­tence I would never com­plete.”</p>
    <p>He thinks that na­tion­al­ism seems to be on the rise be­cause it is in fact “on the run”, as glob­al­ism in­creases in­ex­orably.</p>
    <p>“Every time one of you falls in love with some­body from an­other tra­di­tion or an­other cul­ture, the chil­dren who might arise out of your union will fling an­other black-and-white di­vi­sion out of the win­dow.”</p>
    <p>He has seen such changes oc­cur in his life­time. “I re­mem­ber how, when I was very small, 98 per cent of Amer­i­cans dis­ap­proved of mixed-race mar­riages. The num­ber in 2014 was 3 per cent. That’s an ex­tra­or­di­nary change in one life­time.”</p>
    <p>2020 has served to il­lus­trate ev­ery­thing good and bad about glob­al­ism, he said. “The story of this cu­ri­ous year is how much a lo­cal sneeze has global con­se­quences, that what be­gan with one in­di­vid­ual in a lit­tle mar­ket in Wuhan can to some ex­tent paral­yse the en­tire world.</p>
    <p>“On the one hand, the virus be­gan lo­cally and spread across the world very quickly. On the other, a vac­cine will arise at one lab and, we hope, will spread across the world very quickly.</p>
    <p>“On the one hand, nearly ev­ery­body in every coun­try has had to stay at home. On the other, in ways I lit­er­ally couldn’t have imag­ined 20 years ago, I get to talk to you and see you on­screen while be­ing 8,000 miles away.</p>
    <p>“That was not pos­si­ble in the year 2000 or 2005. And it means that even as we’re all sit­ting apart, we’re in some ways stand­ing to­gether.”</p>
    <p>On the one hand, the virus be­gan lo­cally and spread across the world very quickly.</p>
    <p>On the other, a vac­cine will arise at one lab and, we hope, will spread across the world very quickly. On the one hand, nearly ev­ery­body in every coun­try has had to stay at home. On the other, in ways I lit­er­ally couldn’t have imag­ined 20 years ago, I get to talk to you and see you on­screen while be­ing 8,000 miles away.</p>
