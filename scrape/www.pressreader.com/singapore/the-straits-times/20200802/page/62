        | | B14 The Sunday Times Sunday, August 2, 2020 What banking will look like in the future destroy the confidence of consumers,” he says.
However, instead of seeing this as a chore, banks can gain trust and customer loyalty if they go out of their way to protect customers’ data and use AI to limit fraudulent transactio­ns.
They can also educate customers to be wary of scams by flagging potential threats or suspicious activity before these do any damage. In the way e-commerce giant Amazon has been able to use data to accurately predict what its frequent customers want to buy, banks should use data creatively to offer added value and new services. Many banks now still stick to outdated modes of prospectin­g for new business, such as randomly calling up customers to offer quick loans, even though a simple check on their own databases will reveal that the people have excess funds in their accounts and no credit card debts. Imagine this scenario some time in the near future.
You are in a mall and notice that a few new cars are on sale in the atrium. You are interested in one of the cars and scan a code with a banking app that has the vehicle’s details and price. Then the magic of digital banking kicks in.
In just seconds, your bank replies with a simple message: “As your current car is already more than nine years old, this is a good time to buy a new one.
“From the details that you have forwarded to us, our checks with other car retailers show that this is a competitiv­e price for a car of the same class. Click here for the details.
“You can afford to buy this car. As a special promotion, you can click here to generate a special code for the car loan that we have worked out for you. Use this code if you wish to purchase the car now. We will settle the payment with the dealer.
“If you need to sell your current car, click here to see the offer prices from our panel of used-car traders.”
Sounds too good to be true? If financial technology experts such as Professor Markos Zachariadi­s of The University of Manchester have curately predict what its frequent customers want to buy, banks should use data creatively to offer added value and new services.
Many banks now still stick to outdated modes of prospectin­g for new business, such as randomly calling up customers to offer quick loans, even though a simple check on their own databases will reveal that the people have excess funds in their accounts and no credit card debts. Similarly, few banks follow up and propose good offers to existing customers when their funds mature.
Banks would do well to get these basics right first so that they can upgrade to the next step, which is to work with other partners to offer new products and services. their way, this is how banks should make use of technology to provide better service and a richer experience for their customers.
He says in his recent report, commission­ed by HSBC, that a common myth is that traditiona­l banks are “lumbering dinosaurs ripe for extinction”.
But rather than going out of business, banks have the resources to change the whole operating model and make it even more appealing if they make creative use of data and technology to give their customers a good banking experience.
So instead of selling products, which most banks still do now, Prof Zachariadi­s says they should offer personalis­ed services and experience­s.
“The role of experience as an important part of the mediation in selling goods and services is not new, but it was revived by firms such as Apple that paid particular attention to the emotional components and events packed into their services and products,” he says.
As it is, thanks to e-banking, you can already perform many traditiona­l money transactio­ns without any help from the bank. These include: • Transferri­ng funds to both local and overseas recipients without needing to go to an ATM or the bank;
Making contactles­s payments with smartphone­s or gadgets without needing a physical credit card;
Making foreign exchange conversion­s between different currency accounts;
Buying and selling investment­s like unit trusts and equities online; and
Applying for personal loans or mortgages. CASH IS STILL RELEVANT • E-banking does not mean that cash or plastic credit cards will disappear completely over the next decade.
“Physical money will still have a role to play – albeit a significan­tly reduced one,” Prof Zachariadi­s says.
“Open banking will certainly push large card networks to reduce their fees, but ‘plastic money’ will persist, as there is a huge installed base and infrastruc­ture that cannot be replaced overnight.”
After all, new methods of payment will have to be tested, improved, adopted and – crucially – trusted by consumers before people feel comfortabl­e about leaving home without their cards.
“Banks can certainly play a leading role in this transition, as retail payments processes and IT (informatio­n technology) architectu­res are re-engineered to fill the gap.” • • • Indeed, with the use of artificial intelligen­ce (AI), HSBC can now process transactio­ns quickly. For instance, the duration for mortgage approvals has been cut from 22 days to just one, while credit card approvals, which used to take three to six days, can be done instantly.
But Prof Zachariadi­s says banks can do better in more areas. MAKE DIGITAL BANKING SAFE Prof Zachariadi­s says the No. 1 priority for financial institutio­ns is cyber security, as they are 300 times more likely to be hit by cyber attacks than other companies.
“The security of customers’ money and assets is paramount, and businesses are investing heavily to stay ahead of the criminals.
