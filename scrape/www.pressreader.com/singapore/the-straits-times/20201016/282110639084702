    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has changed work­ing ar­range­ments, with em­ploy­ees find­ing them­selves work­ing en­tirely from home or en­gag­ing in what Zoom Video Com­mu­ni­ca­tions’ chief Eric Yuan refers to as a “hy­brid work model” – that is, work­ing both at home and in the of­fice.</p>
    <p>The re­cent sur­vey on peo­ple’s thoughts about go­ing back to the of­fice re­vealed that a sig­nif­i­cant ma­jor­ity pre­fer to work from home, ei­ther com­pletely or for sev­eral days a week (8 in 10 want to work from home or have more flex­i­bil­ity, Oct 12).</p>
    <p>Up un­til the pan­demic hit, many em­ploy­ees found it dif­fi­cult to ac­cess or re­quest flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments. Many em­ploy­ers wanted em­ploy­ees to be phys­i­cally present at their work­place, re­gard­less of pro­duc­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>In the sur­vey, work­ers ex­pressed a fear of be­ing “pe­nalised by their bosses if they ex­pressed their pref­er­ence to work from home”, and re­counted dif­fi­cul­ties with con­vinc­ing their bosses of their pro­duc­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>These sen­ti­ments were echoed in re­cent re­search by the As­so­ci­a­tion of Women for Ac­tion and Re­search (Aware) into the con­flict be­tween care­giv­ing and work (for both low-in­come moth­ers and fe­male care­givers for the el­derly).</p>
    <p>We found that women who were un­able to adopt suit­able flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments ended up hav­ing to leave the work­force ei­ther com­pletely or par­tially, en­dure fi­nan­cial loss and of­ten re­peat­edly jus­tify their com­mit­ment to their work.</p>
    <p>Un­sup­port­ive or­gan­i­sa­tional cul­tures and man­agers have been found to con­trib­ute to the low take-up rate of flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments. Even when com­pa­nies have poli­cies for such ar­range­ments, mid­dle man­agers with de­ci­sion-mak­ing au­thor­ity of­ten per­sist in judg­ing em­ploy­ees’ pro­duc­tiv­ity by the num­ber of hours they clock on­line or in face-to-face meet­ings.</p>
    <p>The mere avail­abil­ity of flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments is not a suf­fi­cient so­lu­tion to the prob­lems faced by over-bur­dened work­ers. One cru­cial miss­ing com­po­nent is the right for all em­ploy­ees to re­quest such ar­range­ments, ir­re­spec­tive of em­ploy­ment type. Such re­quests should be turned down only on busi­ness-re­lated grounds, and em­ploy­ers should have a dead­line to re­spond to these re­quests (which may pre­vent mis­use of this pro­vi­sion).</p>
    <p>If flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments be­come a labour right, we will not have to de­pend on the benev­o­lence of line man­agers.</p>
    <p>This will ben­e­fit not just moth­ers and care­givers, but ev­ery­one.</p>
