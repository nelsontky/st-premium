    <p>NEW YORK • With Broad­way and the­atres idle in the United States be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, some ac­tors, pro­duc­ers and prop de­sign­ers have found an un­likely out­let for their tal­ents: a mu­si­cal ver­sion of the an­i­mated film Rata­touille (2007) that is play­ing out in ex­u­ber­ant 60-sec­ond in­cre­ments on TikTok.</p>
    <p>Start­ing in Oc­to­ber, thou­sands of TikTok users, in­clud­ing many with Broad­way cred­its, have paid homage to the Disney Pixar film, about a rat who dreams of be­com­ing a French chef, by cre­at­ing their own songs, dances, make-up looks, set de­signs, pup­pets and Play­bill pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>The re­sult is a vir­tual show un­like any on Broad­way.</p>
    <p>There is no di­rec­tor, no chore­og­ra­pher, no stage crew. It has come to­gether or­gan­i­cally on TikTok, where users have only a minute to catch peo­ple’s at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>In the film, Remy the rat fol­lows the ex­am­ple of a fa­mous chef who says “any­one can cook”.</p>
    <p>It is in that spirit that pro­fes­sion­als and am­a­teurs have taken up the Rata­touille mu­si­cal chal­lenge, said Mr Bran­don Hardy, a pup­pet de­signer whose Broad­way cred­its in­clude Char­lie And The Choco­late Fac­tory and The Pee-Wee Her­man Show.</p>
    <p>“He never lim­ited him­self on his vi­sion,” Mr Hardy, 30, said of Remy.</p>
    <p>He added: “We just fell in love with this and we don’t want any­one to stop us.”</p>
    <p>The project be­gan in Au­gust, when Ms Emily Ja­cob­sen, 26, a school­teacher, Disney fa­natic and theatre lover from New York, read about a Rata­touille ride that is sched­uled to open next year at Walt Disney World in Florida.</p>
    <p>As she was clean­ing her apart­ment, she started singing a song about Remy.</p>
    <p>Adopt­ing a high pitch, she recorded what she de­scribed as “a love bal­lad” for the rat – “Remy, the rata­touille/The rat of all my dreams/I praise you, my rata­touille/May the world re­mem­ber your name” – and posted a video of the tune on TikTok.</p>
    <p>Mr Daniel Mert­zlufft, 27, a New York-based com­poser, or­ches­tra­tor and ar­ranger, was tagged in Ms Ja­cob­sen’s video.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber, he used a com­puter pro­gram to en­hance her orig­i­nal ode to Remy, adding a French horn, trum­pets, vo­cals and strings to create a big Disney-style fi­nale for a Rata­touille mu­si­cal.</p>
    <p>Mr Mert­zlufft said he had been in­spired by the mu­sic Alan Menken com­posed for The Lit­tle Mer­maid (1989), Beauty And The Beast (1991) and other clas­sic an­i­mated Disney films.</p>
    <p>Since Mr Mert­zlufft posted his video in mid-Oc­to­ber, thou­sands of oth­ers have shared their own con­tri­bu­tions to what has be­come some­thing of a vir­tual Rata­touille mu­si­cal.</p>
    <p>In the l ast few days, Disney sig­nalled that it had been pay­ing at­ten­tion, quot­ing Ms Ja­cob­sen’s lyrics on In­sta­gram and Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>It even made its own TikTok rap at Ep­cot, where the Rata­touille ride is be­ing built.</p>
    <p>“We love when our fans en­gage with our sto­ries,” Disney said in a state­ment, “and we look for­ward to see­ing these su­per fans ex­pe­ri­ence the at­trac­tion when it opens at Walt Disney World next year.”</p>
    <p>Mr R.J. Chris­tian, 21, a vo­cal per­for­mance stu­dent at New York Univer­sity, said he had been in­spired by the movie’s acer­bic food critic, An­ton Ego, for the solo he con­trib­uted.</p>
    <p>He said he wanted to em­body Ego with “weird chords, spicy har­mony and creepy-crawly kind of mu­sic”.</p>
    <p>For Blake Rouse, 17, the Rata­touille project gave him an out­let af­ter the pan­demic forced the can­cel­la­tion of his high school’s pro­duc­tion of Newsies.</p>
    <p>He con­trib­uted sev­eral songs based on scenes from the movie, in­clud­ing a tango be­tween two chefs and a duet be­tween Remy and his brother.</p>
    <p>“This is no longer a niche TikTok theatre joke,” he said. “This is kind of a thing that peo­ple care about and are start­ing to keep up with.”</p>
    <p>The con­tri­bu­tions go be­yond per­for­mances. Mr Hardy made some masks and small pup­pets for the vir­tual show, even us­ing garbage to create some of the el­e­ments.</p>
    <p>“We’ve cre­ated some­thing that’s en­gag­ing to peo­ple at ev­ery level,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple of ev­ery age group are fas­ci­nated by this and want to con­trib­ute to this. As far as I’ve seen, there hasn’t been a show or mu­si­cal in his­tory that’s sort of op­er­ated that way.”</p>
    <p>Mr Christo­pher Routh, 30, used boxes to create elab­o­rate minia­ture set de­signs for the show, com­plete with light­ing and a Lego ro­bot­ics set to move around the pieces.</p>
    <p>“It’s such an in­cred­i­ble trend on how our com­mu­nity can come to­gether like this and create a mu­si­cal out of nowhere,” he said. “And it all started with one girl.”</p>
