    <p>Could liv­ing things be drift­ing within the toxic at­mo­spheric soup swirling around Venus? As­tronomers say this is a pos­si­bil­ity, af­ter dis­cov­er­ing a foul-smelling gas there that is an in­te­gral part of life as we know it.</p>
    <p>Phos­phine gas – made of phos­pho­rus and three hy­dro­gen atoms – is pro­duced by mi­cro­bial ac­tiv­ity in en­vi­ron­ments such as man­groves, an­i­mal in­testi­nal tracts and sewage. If not for liv­ing things, phos­phine would not be nat­u­rally found on Earth as it can­not be made by any other at­mo­spheric or ge­o­log­i­cal process.</p>
    <p>Work that led to the dis­cov­ery of phos­phine on Venus be­gan more than two years ago.</p>
    <p>In J une 2017, Pro­fes­sor J ane Greaves – an as­tronomer at Cardiff Univer­sity in Bri­tain – and her team stud­ied Venus through a pow­er­ful tele­scope, the James Clerk Maxwell Tele­scope in Hawaii. The tele­scope uses ra­dio wave­lengths to scan the planet, and phos­phine was one of the mol­e­cules that ab­sorbed the ra­dio waves. The gas was dis­cov­ered in Venus’ at­mos­phere, 50km to 60km away from the sur­face.</p>
    <p>The find­ings were con­firmed and repli­cated in an ar­ray of tele­scopes on a plateau in Chile.</p>
    <p>But sci­en­tists will not know for sure if a bi­o­log­i­cal source is re­spon­si­ble for the phos­phine with­out send­ing a space­craft to Venus, which is what Rocket Lab, a pri­vate small-rocket com­pany founded in New Zealand, has been work­ing on, ac­cord­ing to re­ports. The com­pany says it has devel­oped a small satel­lite that it hopes to launch on its elec­tron rocket in two years.</p>
    <p>The phos­phine dis­cov­ery was pub­lished in Na­ture Astron­omy this week, and an­other paper was sub­mit­ted to the jour­nal Astro­bi­ol­ogy.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment sent rip­ples through the plan­e­tary com­mu­nity, cast­ing the spotlight on a hos­tile planet l ong over­looked i n t he search for life be­yond Earth.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists say, how­ever, that we can­not rule out the pos­si­bil­ity that the gas is pro­duced by some as-yet un­known process on the sec­ond planet from the Sun.</p>
    <p>The high-pres­sure at­mos­phere on Venus, and tem­per­a­tures reach­ing 460 deg C, mean that earthly crea­tures would be cooked and crushed al­most im­me­di­ately. Then there is the rain to con­tend with, which on that planet is made up of ex­tremely cor­ro­sive sul­phuric acid.</p>
    <p>How­ever, as early as 1967, renowned as­tronomer Carl Sa­gan and bio­physi­cist Harold Morowitz had sug­gested that Venus’ clouds could sus­tain life.</p>
    <p>“If small amounts of min­er­als are stirred up to the clouds from the sur­face, it is by no means dif­fi­cult to imag­ine an in­dige­nous bi­ol­ogy in the clouds of Venus,” they wrote in a paper pub­lished in Na­ture.</p>
    <p>Fifty years later, the re­searchers who dis­cov­ered phos­phine on the planet have cau­tiously laid the same idea on the table.</p>
    <p>HYPOTHESIS OF LAST RE­SORT</p>
    <p>“It was kind of a hypothesis of last re­sort,” said Dr Sukrit Ran­jan, post­doc­toral fel­low at the Cen­tre for In­ter­dis­ci­plinary Ex­plo­ration and Re­search in Astro­physics at North­west­ern Univer­sity in the United States, and one of the au­thors of the pa­pers.</p>
    <p>“We have to be self-scep­ti­cal and very care­ful. Bi­ol­ogy re­ally needs to be the ex­pla­na­tion of last re­sort be­cause the at­mos­phere of Venus is a very harsh en­vi­ron­ment and it isn’t a nat­u­ral fit at least for life as we know it.”</p>
    <p>He and his team were over the moon when the dis­cov­ery was con­firmed. “Sci­ence of­ten doesn’t have very many of those ‘gotcha’ mo­ments. These eureka mo­ments are ac­tu­ally quite rare,” he said.</p>
    <p>He stressed that it is by no means cer­tain that the find­ing def­i­nitely points to life on the planet, although there is no other way of ex­plain­ing its pres­ence.</p>
    <p>“We’re not propos­ing that there is bi­ol­ogy on Venus. What we’re say­ing is that the ex­ist­ing mech­a­nisms that we have used to ex­plain the pres­ence of phos­phine there have so far fallen short,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal ex­perts ST spoke to also said it was too early to jump to con­clu­sions.</p>
    <p>“I think it is pre­ma­ture to con­sider (the pres­ence of phos­phine) as a sign of life. There is a lot we do not know about the at­mos­phere of Venus, such as the chem­i­cal re­ac­tions that would cre­ate phos­phine, or even the source of phos­pho­rus,” said Dr Abel Yang, a lec­turer at the</p>
    <p>Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) physics depart­ment.</p>
    <p>Dr Ran­jan added that the team had an­a­lysed pos­si­ble pro­cesses that could pro­duce phos­phine, such as lightning, vol­canic gas and me­te­oritic ac­tiv­ity, but none of those could pro­duce such high con­cen­tra­tions of the gas.</p>
    <p>The amount of phos­phine in Venus is about 20 parts per bil­lion, which ex­ceeds the amount that known pro­cesses can churn out, by sev­eral fac­tors of 10.</p>
    <p>That left the team with two op­tions: an ex­otic chem­i­cal or ge­o­log­i­cal mech­a­nism that is un­known, or the more tan­ta­lis­ing op­tion – bi­o­log­i­cal pro­cesses, which are known to re­lease co­pi­ous amounts of phos­phine, at least on Earth.</p>
    <p>EX­TRA­OR­DI­NARY LIFE FORMS</p>
    <p>As the late Dr Sa­gan sug­gested, Venus’ clouds have el­e­ments that make it po­ten­tially hab­it­able.</p>
    <p>For one thing, the area con­tain­ing phos­phine has liq­uid wa­ter, which is a main in­gre­di­ent for life.</p>
    <p>“At about 50km alti­tude, the at­mos­phere has roughly sim­i­lar at­mo­spheric pres­sure and temperatur­e to Earth,” said Dr Yang. “That, how­ever, cov­ers only the phys­i­cal as­pects and does not cover the chem­istry as­pect (of the en­vi­ron­ment).”</p>
    <p>Dr Ran­jan said the prom­ise of wa­ter shrinks in com­par­i­son with the high amounts of sul­phuric acid in the clouds, which cre­ate a harsh and hos­tile home. Sul­phuric acid can de­hy­drate wa­ter.</p>
    <p>“Any kind of life, if it’s present there, would have to en­dure con­di­tions that are much, much more ex­treme than any­thing we have here on Earth,” he added.</p>
    <p>“It’s far out of the bounds of any of the ex­tremophile­s that we have here. So it would need to have some kind of re­ally ex­tra­or­di­nary (traits), if it’s there.”</p>
    <p>Ex­tremophile­s are or­gan­isms on Earth that thrive in ex­treme en­vi­ron­ments such as deep ocean trenches and in­side the Earth’s crust.</p>
    <p>The phos­phine dis­cov­ery is just the pro­logue of this new cos­mic nar­ra­tive, and Dr Ran­jan views the pa­pers more as a “call to ac­tion, as a call to fur­ther work, more than any­thing else”.</p>
    <p>He hopes that the sci­en­tific com­mu­nity will come for­ward to dou­ble-check the team’s find­ings, un­earth the chem­istry of phos­phine fur­ther, and even plan mis­sions to Venus to take a closer look at its at­mos­phere.</p>
    <p>“In or­der to rule out ge­o­log­i­cal process as the cause of phos­phine pro­duc­tion, re­searchers need to con­sider more un­known ge­o­log­i­cal pro­cesses in their mod­el­ling,” stressed Dr Cindy Ng, a se­nior lec­turer at NUS’ physics depart­ment.</p>
    <p>LIFE AS WE DON’T KNOW IT</p>
    <p>All liv­ing things on Earth are made of carbon, the build­ing block of life, but is there a pos­si­bil­ity of non-carbon-based life forms else­where?</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists are of­ten hes­i­tant in spec­u­lat­ing about this as they risk delv­ing into the realms of sci­ence fic­tion.</p>
    <p>But a re­cent study by three of the phos­phine re­searchers from the Mas­sachusetts In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy an­a­lysed the pos­si­bil­ity of sil­i­con-based life, and posited that sul­phuric acid could sup­port more com­pounds with carbon-sil­i­con bonds.</p>
    <p>“The cen­tral ques­tion that lies be­hind this is whether there has been a sec­ond ge­n­e­sis for life any­where other than on Earth,” said Pro­fes­sor Stephen Point­ing, direc­tor of sci­ence at Yale-NUS Col­lege, who has spent more than 20 years re­search­ing mi­cro­bial life in ex­treme en­vi­ron­ments world­wide.</p>
    <p>For­mer Sci­ence Cen­tre Sin­ga­pore chief ex­ec­u­tive Chew Tuan Chiong noted that look­ing for life forms sim­i­lar to what is found on Earth sat­is­fies “an in­nate cu­rios­ity and is also mean­ing­ful for ex­is­ten­tial rea­sons”, although this may be far from re­al­ity.</p>
    <p>“We are likely to be sur­prised and pos­si­bly shocked by what we even­tu­ally find,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Chew added that it is al­most a cer­tainty that there is life – whether it is in a form seen on Earth or some­thing be­yond our wildest imag­i­na­tions – some­where in the vast uni­verse. The dif­fi­culty, how­ever, lies in know­ing what to look for.</p>
    <p>“That’s why we dream about find­ing ex­tra-ter­res­trial in­tel­li­gence in our im­age, or those which at least man­i­fest them­selves that way.</p>
    <p>“In a sense, it is like search­ing for God.”</p>
