    <p>NEW YORK • Bri­tish drug­maker As­traZeneca stopped giv­ing shots of its ex­per­i­men­tal coro­n­avirus vac­cine af­ter a per­son par­tic­i­pat­ing in one of the com­pany’s stud­ies got sick, a po­ten­tial ad­verse re­ac­tion that could de­lay or de­rail ef­forts to speed up im­mu­ni­sa­tion against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The pause stemmed from a standard re­view of the com­pany’s vac­cine tri­als af­ter one per­son de­vel­oped an un­ex­plained ill­ness, the com­pany said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>A vol­un­teer in the Bri­tish tri­als was di­ag­nosed with trans­verse myeli­tis, an in­flam­ma­tion of the spinal cord gen­er­ally caused by in­fec­tions, The New York Times said, cit­ing a source close to the sit­u­a­tion that it did not name.</p>
    <p>The move was in­tended to give re­searchers time to ex­am­ine safety data while main­tain­ing the in­tegrity of the tri­als, As­traZeneca said. The drug­maker’s shares fell as much as 3 per cent in Lon­don yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine, which the com­pany is de­vel­op­ing with re­searchers from the Univer­sity of Ox­ford, has been viewed as one of the lead­ing can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>The part­ners are aiming to en­rol as many as 50,000 par­tic­i­pants for late-stage tri­als that are un­der way in Bri­tain, the United States, Brazil and South Africa, with oth­ers planned for Ja­pan and Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>“This is a rou­tine ac­tion which has to hap­pen when­ever there is a po­ten­tially un­ex­plained ill­ness in one of the tri­als, while it is in­ves­ti­gated, en­sur­ing we main­tain the in­tegrity of the tri­als,” As­traZeneca spokesman Michele Meix­ell said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>She added that it is too early to de­ter­mine the sick par­tic­i­pant’s spe­cific di­ag­no­sis.</p>
    <p>The de­vel­op­ment has the po­ten­tial to dis­rupt one of the most closely watched sci­en­tific sprints in his­tory.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies have been work­ing to find a vac­cine in the hopes of blunt­ing a pan­demic that has sick­ened more than 27.7 mil­lion peo­ple and killed over 900,000 world­wide.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials in the US and Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump have re­peat­edly said that it is pos­si­ble to have an im­mu­ni­sa­tion be­fore the year end, and po­ten­tially as early as next month. But Dr An­thony Fauci, di­rec­tor of the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Al­lergy and In­fec­tious Dis­eases, said on Tues­day it is un­likely a Covid-19 vac­cine will be avail­able to the pub­lic by Nov 3.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s chief sci­en­tist, Dr Soumya Swami­nathan, said yes­ter­day that the safety of a prospec­tive Covid-19 vac­cine comes “first and fore­most”.</p>
    <p>“Just be­cause we talk about speed... it doesn’t mean we start com­pro­mis­ing or cut­ting corners on what would nor­mally be as­sessed,” she said in a so­cial me­dia event.</p>
    <p>“The process still has to fol­low through rules of the game. For drugs and vac­cines which are given to peo­ple, you have to test their safety.”</p>
    <p>Dr Mon­cef Slaoui, the top US of­fi­cial in charge of Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed – the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s pro­gramme to sup­port the rapid de­vel­op­ment of Covid-19 vac­cines and ther­a­peu­tics – said in a state­ment that Data Safety Mon­i­tor­ing Boards in the US and Bri­tain are “con­duct­ing an in-depth re­view of the com­pany’s vac­cine can­di­date, which is standard pro­ce­dure when an ad­verse event oc­curs”.</p>
    <p>A Data Safety Mon­i­tor­ing Board is a panel of out­side ex­perts that watches for po­ten­tial harm from ex­per­i­men­tal drugs and vac­cines dur­ing clin­i­cal tri­als. The bar to pause a vac­cine trial is gen­er­ally low since par­tic­i­pants are healthy and may never need the im­mu­ni­sa­tion they have vol­un­teered to re­ceive.</p>
    <p>If af­ter in­ves­ti­gat­ing, the mon­i­tor­ing board is com­fort­able there are rea­sons un­re­lated to the vac­cine to ex­plain the ad­verse event, the trial will be able to con­tinue, he said.</p>
    <p>The US and other gov­ern­ments have in­vested billions of dol­lars to de­velop a shot at an ac­cel­er­ated pace, and more than two dozen vac­cines are now be­ing tested on vol­un­teers less than a year af­ter the virus was first dis­cov­ered. Eleven can­di­dates are in late-stage tri­als.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, nine lead­ing US and Euro­pean vac­cine de­vel­op­ers pledged on Tues­day to up­hold the sci­en­tific stan­dards their ex­per­i­men­tal im­mu­ni­sa­tions will be held against in the global race to con­tain the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing Pfizer, Glax­oSmithK­line and As­traZeneca, is­sued what they called a “his­toric pledge” af­ter a rise in con­cern that safety and ef­fi­cacy stan­dards might slip in the rush to find a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The com­pa­nies said in a state­ment they would “up­hold the in­tegrity of the sci­en­tific process as they work to­wards po­ten­tial global reg­u­la­tory fil­ings and ap­provals of the first Covid-19 vac­cines”.</p>
    <p>The other sig­na­to­ries were John­son & John­son, Merck & Co, Moderna, No­vavax, Sanofi and BioNTech.</p>
    <p>Co-sig­na­tory Ugur Sahin, the chief ex­ec­u­tive of BioNTech, said: “We want it to be known that also in the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion we are not will­ing to com­pro­mise safety and ef­fi­cacy.”</p>
