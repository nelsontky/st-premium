    <p>With­out a shadow of a doubt, the dan­ger­ous down­ward spi­ral in China-US re­la­tions, cou­pled with Covid-19-in­duced up­heavals, con­sti­tutes one of the gravest chal­lenges to Asean today. Left unchecked, th­ese de­vel­op­ments call into ques­tion Asean’s avowed goal of main­tain­ing the re­gion’s peace and sta­bil­ity and the at­ten­dant decades-long “peace div­i­dend”.</p>
    <p>This dan­ger is not im­me­di­ately ap­par­ent in the vol­umes of for­mal Asean state­ments that obliquely avoid di­rect ref­er­ence to China-US ten­sions and typ­i­cally speak in­stead of the risks stem­ming from “chang­ing geopo­lit­i­cal dy­nam­ics”.</p>
    <p>Yet, sep­a­rately and of­ten in­for­mally, each Asean mem­ber state laments the deep­en­ing China-US strate­gic ri­valry; ably de­scribes its in­creas­ingly mul­ti­fac­eted form, be­yond the tra­di­tional mil­i­tary-se­cu­rity do­main into realms of trade, fi­nance and tech­nol­ogy, to cite a few; and ex­presses deep dis­may and con­cern over its con­se­quences.</p>
    <p>Of­ten, a note of ex­as­per­a­tion can be dis­cerned; a de­sire for Asean “not to be forced to choose sides”. The term “hedg­ing” is some­times used.</p>
    <p>It is time that Asean col­lec­tively and for­mally called it for what it is: US-China ri­valry con­sti­tutes a threat to the re­gion’s peace, se­cu­rity and pros­per­ity.</p>
    <p>It is also time for Asean to go be­yond sim­ply de­scrib­ing the ob­vi­ous – the re­al­ity of de­te­ri­o­rat­ing China-US ties – and in­stead take con­crete ac­tion in keep­ing with its of­ten-cited “cen­tral­ity”.</p>
    <p>The Asean Out­look on the Indo-Pa­cific speaks of Asean be­ing “an hon­est bro­ker within the strate­gic en­vi­ron­ment of competing in­ter­ests”. It’s not an in­signif­i­cant dec­la­ra­tion of in­tent.</p>
    <p>But clearly, me­di­at­ing be­tween China and the United States would be a tall or­der for any coun­try, or even groups of coun­tries, in­clud­ing Asean. Af­ter all, the com­pet­i­tive dy­namic be­tween the US and China is a com­plex one, stem­ming from fun­da­men­tal geopo­lit­i­cal shifts and the chang­ing na­ture of power and in­flu­ence in our time. It is also in­creas­ingly driven by their re­spec­tive do­mes­tic con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>That said, while there is an in­creas­ing sense of in­evitabil­ity in the com­pet­i­tive China-US dy­namic, con­fronta­tion and open con­flict be­tween them is not.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, there ex­ists scope still for the man­age­ment of the most ex­treme forms of US-China ri­valry, in­clud­ing that of mis­cal­cu­la­tions flar­ing into un­in­tended open con­flict.</p>
    <p>WHAT ASEAN CAN DO</p>
    <p>The re­gion has many po­ten­tial flash­points. In view of this re­al­ity and given the stakes, Asean must act de­ci­sively to min­imise the op­por­tu­ni­ties for such dan­ger­ous es­ca­la­tions. For­tu­nately, the re­gional group­ing is not with­out the means to do so.</p>
    <p>Decades-long Asean-ini­ti­ated re­gional norms, prin­ci­ples and ar­chi­tec­ture-build­ing have en­sured that the where­withal ex­ists for Asean to make mean­ing­ful con­tri­bu­tions.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the 1976 Treaty of Amity and Co­op­er­a­tion and the 2011 East Asia Sum­mit (EAS) Bali Prin­ci­ples, to which both China and the US sub­scribe, com­mit states to the non-use of force and peace­ful set­tle­ment of dis­putes among them.</p>
    <p>The Asean-ini­ti­ated EAS pro­vides a lead­ers-led forum for strate­gic di­a­logue among key states of the re­gion, China and US in­cluded. Amid the cur­rent de­te­ri­o­rat­ing China-US ties, th­ese modal­i­ties, and oth­ers like them, can be em­pow­ered and utilised.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, an Asean chair and “Friends of the Chair” mis­sion to Washington and Bei­jing or other forms of com­mu­ni­ca­tion to both – equipped with con­crete pro­pos­als dili­gently pre­pared – would send a clear and un­mis­tak­able sig­nal of Asean’s col­lec­tive in­tent and re­solve to pre­serve peace and sta­bil­ity in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>For the immediate term, a reaf­fir­ma­tion of peace­ful set­tle­ment of dis­putes and the es­tab­lish­ment of a China-US-Asean “hot­line” could help re­duce ten­sions and man­age the po­ten­tial for cri­sis over some of the known flash­points in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>In the longer term, an EAS-wide treaty on the non-use of force for the set­tle­ment of dis­putes and a cri­sis man­age­ment ca­pac­ity within the EAS to deal with po­ten­tial</p>

    <p>con­flicts in a more timely and rel­e­vant man­ner could be de­vel­oped.</p>
    <p>RISKS OF SELF-NEU­TER­ING</p>
    <p>Of course, there are al­ways al­ter­na­tive path­ways. Asean could con­tinue to sim­ply ex­press gen­eral con­cern – with­out nam­ing coun­tries – and make well-re­hearsed ex­hor­ta­tions in favour of peace and se­cu­rity in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>It could even choose, as ev­i­dent in the Aug 8 Asean state­ment on the im­por­tance of main­tain­ing peace and sta­bil­ity in South-east Asia, to rein­vig­o­rate past re­sponses, namely “neu­tral­ity”, as one of the key fea­tures of the re­gion.</p>
    <p>But the idea that the South-east Asia re­gion could some­how cor­don it­self off, in a man­ner of an ex­clu­sion zone, from the dy­nam­ics of re­gions be­yond is sim­ply not per­sua­sive. It could also be cor­ro­sive to Asean’s rea­son for be­ing.</p>
    <p>To un­der­stand why, it is in­struc­tive to re­call that some pro­po­nents of the idea of neu­tral­ity of South-east Asia in the early 1970s sug­gested that coun­tries in the re­gion should col­lec­tively de­clare the “neu­tral­i­sa­tion” of South-east Asia, a sta­tus that would be guar­an­teed by the so-called “big pow­ers”.</p>
    <p>Such sen­ti­ments per­haps re­flected the mood and state of the re­gion then, but if Asean now chose the path of “neu­tral­i­sa­tion”, it would be en­fee­bled and ren­dered in­ef­fec­tual, in keep­ing with its lex­i­cal def­i­ni­tion.</p>
    <p>That does not look a promis­ing road for Asean to em­bark on, es­pe­cially con­sid­er­ing what it has achieved.</p>
    <p>For decades, Asean has cho­sen to proac­tively en­gage in shap­ing and in­flu­enc­ing the wider re­gions’ dy­namic.</p>
    <p>Trans­for­ma­tive and con­fi­dent in its out­look, recog­nis­ing the in­di­vis­i­bil­ity of peace be­tween re­gions and is­sues, Asean could rightly as­sert its claim to “cen­tral­ity” in mat­ters af­fect­ing the re­gion and play a role be­yond that of a mere con­vener of sum­mits.</p>
    <p>In­deed, Asean has in the past en­sured that the di­ver­sity of na­tional for­eign pol­icy ori­en­ta­tions and out­look among its mem­ber states – united within the com­mon Asean tent – serves as a source of strength rather than of weak­ness. Unity in di­ver­sity put into ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Not least of all, Asean was able to show that while it is not the most pow­er­ful group­ing of states, it was able to be an im­par­tial and adroit man­ager of the re­gional com­mons, and with it its se­cu­rity, sta­bil­ity and pros­per­ity.</p>
    <p>But in the face of the dan­gers it faces now, in the gath­er­ing storm that is the grow­ing China-US strug­gle for supremacy, Asean mem­ber states should un­der­stand that an im­par­tial and cen­tral Asean is not one that sim­ply main­tains an imag­i­nary per­fect “equidis­tance” be­tween the so-called ma­jor pow­ers.</p>
    <p>OTHER GEOPO­LIT­I­CAL CHAL­LENGES</p>
    <p>A pas­sive Asean in a re­gion marked by con­stant geopo­lit­i­cal shifts, ter­ri­to­rial dis­putes and trust deficits would risk leav­ing Asean “neu­tralised”, an or­gan­i­sa­tion con­signed to ir­rel­e­vance and in­creas­ing fis­sures; a re­gion marked by Cold War-like chasms.</p>
    <p>It should not be for­got­ten that the US-China dy­namic is only one among many chal­leng­ing geopo­lit­i­cal dy­nam­ics with con­se­quences for the re­gion. China-In­dia, China-Ja­pan, China-Russia and US-Russia are some that come to mind. Asean must seek equi­lib­rium amid them all.</p>
    <p>Peace and se­cu­rity in the re­gion must be ac­tively waged. Asean must pro­ceed be­yond de­scrib­ing or lament­ing the ob­vi­ous. The deep­en­ing China-US ri­val­ries and pos­si­ble con­fronta­tion are too much of a threat to the re­gion for Asean to hide be­hind oblique state­ments.</p>
    <p>It is high time for Asean to ex­plic­itly and openly call on China and US to get their act to­gether. More than ex­hor­ta­tions, it should of­fer con­crete sug­ges­tions to help man­age this and other geopo­lit­i­cal ri­val­ries.</p>
    <p>By do­ing so, the 10 mem­ber states will have ac­com­plished an im­por­tant, foun­da­tional ob­jec­tive: an Asean that mat­ters.</p>
