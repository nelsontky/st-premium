    <p>TAI­WAN’S RE­AC­TION</p>
    <p>These military in­tim­i­da­tions have caused re­sent­ment among the Tai­wanese peo­ple.</p>
    <p>TAI­WAN’S PRES­I­DEN­TIAL OF­FICE, urg­ing China to ex­er­cise restraint. CHINA’S AC­TION</p>
    <p>This is a le­git­i­mate and nec­es­sary ac­tion taken to safe­guard China’s sovereignt­y and ter­ri­to­rial in­tegrity in re­sponse to the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion in the Tai­wan Strait.</p>
    <p>CHI­NESE DE­FENCE MIN­ISTRY SPOKESMAN REN GUOQIANG, say­ing Bei­jing was hold­ing ac­tual com­bat ex­er­cises near the Tai­wan Strait in re­sponse to Mr Keith Krach’s visit.</p>
    <p>U.S. DEL­E­GA­TION SENT FOR FU­NERAL</p>
    <p>We sent the del­e­ga­tion to a fu­neral, and the Chi­nese have ap­par­ently re­sponded by military blus­ter­ing. I’ll leave it at that.</p>
    <p>U.S. SEC­RE­TARY OF STATE MIKE POM­PEO, re­fer­ring to for­mer Tai­wanese pres­i­dent Lee Teng-hui’s me­mo­rial ser­vice to­day.</p>
    <p>A top United States diplo­mat’s visit to Tai­wan was marked by more than a dozen Chi­nese military jets fly­ing into the is­land’s airspace yes­ter­day to sig­nal Bei­jing’s dis­plea­sure, which prompted Taipei to scram­ble its own fighter planes in re­sponse.</p>
    <p>US Un­der­sec­re­tary for Eco­nomic Af­fairs Keith Krach, who ar­rived in Taipei on Thurs­day for a three-day trip, is the most se­nior State Depart­ment of­fi­cial to visit the Chi­nese­claimed is­land in four decades.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan fighter jets took to the skies as 18 Chi­nese air­craft buzzed the is­land, cross­ing the sen­si­tive mid-line of the Tai­wan Strait.</p>
    <p>The Tai­wanese au­thor­i­ties said there were far more air­craft in­volved yes­ter­day than in pre­vi­ous such en­coun­ters.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese De­fence Min­istry spokesman Ren Guoqiang said Bei­jing was “hold­ing ac­tual com­bat ex­er­cises near the Tai­wan Strait” in re­sponse to Mr Krach’s visit.</p>
    <p>He re­ferred to the military drills as “a le­git­i­mate and nec­es­sary ac­tion the main­land has taken to pro­tect its sovereignt­y and in­tegrity”, Chi­nese state-backed tabloid Global Times re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>China re­gards Tai­wan as a rene­gade prov­ince to be re­united with the main­land, by force if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Try­ing to “use Tai­wan to con­trol China” or “rely on for­eign­ers to build up one­self” was wish­ful think­ing and fu­tile, Mr Ren said, warn­ing that “those who play with fire will get burnt”.</p>
    <p>Global Times editor Hu Xi­jin posted on Weibo that the mar­itime and ae­rial drills were part of prepa­ra­tions for an at­tack on Tai­wan if the need arose. He added that the military ex­er­cises were a valu­able ex­pe­ri­ence and gath­ered in­tel­li­gence about Tai­wan’s de­fence sys­tems.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan’s pres­i­den­tial of­fice urged China to ex­er­cise restraint.</p>
    <p>“These military in­tim­i­da­tions have caused re­sent­ment among the Tai­wanese peo­ple,” it said.</p>
    <p>Mr Krach met Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing­wen and other se­nior of­fi­cials yes­ter­day, and will at­tend for­mer pres­i­dent Lee Teng-hui’s me­mo­rial ser­vice to­day.</p>
    <p>Asked about the height­ened Chi­nese ac­tiv­ity dur­ing the diplo­mat’s visit, US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo was dis­mis­sive.</p>
    <p>“We sent the del­e­ga­tion to a fu­neral, and the Chi­nese have ap­par­ently re­sponded by military blus­ter­ing. I’ll leave it at that,” he told a news con­fer­ence on a visit to Guyana, South Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>Ms Tsai’s of­fice is­sued a state­ment yes­ter­day, which said: “The Pres­i­dent be­lieves that by wel­com­ing old and new friends of Tai­wan with the heart­warm­ing ban­quet tonight, Tai­wan is ex­press­ing its de­ter­mi­na­tion in tak­ing a key step to es­tab­lish a new mile­stone in deep­en­ing Tai­wan-US col­lab­o­ra­tions. (We) hope that through fu­ture col­lab­o­ra­tion and di­a­logue, Tai­wan-US re­la­tions can keep de­vel­op­ing, lead­ing to a friend­lier and closer part­ner­ship.”</p>
    <p>Tai­wan’s For­eign Min­istry said in a sep­a­rate state­ment that “Tai­wan is a close part­ner of the US in the In­doPa­cific re­gion and will con­tinue fur­ther­ing this part­ner­ship un­der the foun­da­tion of mu­tual trust and mu­tual ben­e­fit”.</p>
    <p>Both the US and Tai­wan had kept mum on Mr Krach’s visit un­til State Depart­ment spokesman Mor­gan Orta­gus tweeted early on Thurs­day that the of­fi­cial was on his way to the is­land. Bei­jing lodged a com­plaint with Washington over the visit on Thurs­day, say­ing that it would soon make a “nec­es­sary re­sponse”.</p>
    <p>Mr Krach is the sec­ond US of­fi­cial to visit Tai­wan in as many months, af­ter Sec­re­tary of Health and Hu­man Ser­vices Alex Azar’s trip to Taipei on Aug 10.</p>
    <p>On Mr Azar’s visit, dur­ing which he met Ms Tsai, Chi­nese fighter jets also briefly crossed the mid-line of the Tai­wan Strait.</p>
    <p>Sino-US re­la­tions are at their low­est point in decades, and ten­sions over Tai­wan, on top of other is­sues, in­clud­ing the coro­n­avirus, cy­ber se­cu­rity and trade, have wors­ened ties in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>In a move set to fur­ther es­ca­late mat­ters, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion is push­ing the sale of seven large pack­ages of weapons to Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed sale comes as US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and his cam­paign strate­gists try to paint him as get­ting tough on China in the run-up to the elec­tion in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, China has ac­cused Tai­wanese in­tel­li­gence agen­cies of tar­get­ing main­land stu­dents on the is­land. The ac­cu­sa­tions, first made last Satur­day by state broad­caster China Cen­tral Tele­vi­sion, have now been re­ported by at least six other Chi­nese news out­lets.</p>
    <p>The re­ports cited cases from as far back as 2011, and said that in ad­di­tion to stu­dents, a ho­tel em­ployee and a driver for a travel agency had also been tar­geted for in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan’s Main­land Af­fairs Coun­cil blasted China’s ac­cu­sa­tions as hyp­o­crit­i­cal.</p>
