    <p>SEOUL • South Korea’s bat­tle to con­tain a new out­break of the coro­n­avirus has been com­pli­cated by a po­lit­i­cal and re­li­gious fight be­tween Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in’s ad­min­is­tra­tion and some of his fiercest crit­ics.</p>
    <p>Sarang Jeil Church is the sec­ond re­li­gious group at the cen­tre of a ma­jor Covid-19 out­break in South Korea.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment ac­cuses the church of ob­struc­tion by not pro­vid­ing com­plete lists of its mem­bers and spread­ing fake news that is hin­der­ing anti-virus ef­forts, while church mem­bers say they are vic­tims of a po­lit­i­cally mo­ti­vated witch hunt.</p>
    <p>When the first in­fec­tions were re­ported among church mem­bers on Aug 12, the gov­ern­ment said the group flouted so­cial dis­tanc­ing in­struc­tions, with the church’s leader and oth­ers at­tend­ing a mas­sive anti-Moon rally in Seoul on Aug 15.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the rally, Rev­erend Jun Kwang-hoon said Mr Moon had “ter­rorised our church with the Wuhan virus”. The coro­n­avirus out­break was first de­tected in cen­tral China’s Wuhan city late last year.</p>
    <p>Rev­erend Jun, an out­spo­ken gov­ern­ment critic, later tested pos­i­tive for the virus.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 cases tied to the church in north­ern Seoul to­talled 796 as of noon yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It is the largest clus­ter since more than 5,000 Covid-19 cases were traced to another con­tro­ver­sial re­li­gious group, the Shin­cheonji Church of Je­sus, in late Fe­bru­ary and early March.</p>
    <p>That was South Korea’s first ma­jor out­break, ac­count­ing for al­most a third of the coun­try’s to­tal 16,670 cases.</p>
    <p>On Fri­day night, po­lice ex­e­cuted a search war­rant at the Sarang Jeil Church’s of­fice to gather mem­ber­ship lists, church of­fi­cial Lee Dong-ho said.</p>
    <p>The church said it had al­ready pro­vided full lists, but the health au­thor­i­ties ac­cused the church of un­der-re­port­ing its mem­ber­ship.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry said last Sunday it had filed a com­plaint against Rev­erend Jun for vi­o­lat­ing self-iso­la­tion rules by par­tic­i­pat­ing in the rally, and for ob­struct­ing a med­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the out­break.</p>
    <p>Mr Peter Ko, an at­tor­ney for Rev­erend Jun, said the church had fol­lowed so­cial dis­tanc­ing guide­lines and the church leader was at the rally for only about 15 min­utes.</p>
    <p>Some Sarang Jeil mem­bers say the gov­ern­ment is fab­ri­cat­ing the test re­sults as part of a plot to per­se­cute them.</p>
    <p>Mr Ko said that for those who iden­tify them­selves as church mem­bers to clinic staff, their re­sults are more likely to come back pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>“When we go get tested else­where and do not men­tion that we are a mem­ber of the con­gre­ga­tion, we’d test neg­a­tive,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I would say there is a fab­ri­ca­tion,” he added.</p>
    <p>One of the church’s pas­tors, Ms Lee Hae-suk, said she was ini­tially told her test was neg­a­tive, but the next day she re­ceived a mes­sage say­ing she had tested pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>“I can think of no other rea­son than that this is a plot to kill Sarang Jeil Church by in­creas­ing the num­ber of con­firmed cases,” she said.</p>
    <p>When asked who she thinks is be­hind the plot, she said: “Moon Jaein.”</p>
    <p>Another the­ory ad­vanced by some mem­bers is that the out­break is a “ter­ror at­tack”, pos­si­bly</p>
