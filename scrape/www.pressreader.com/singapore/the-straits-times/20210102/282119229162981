    <p>Pres­i­dent-elect Joseph Bi­den has made the restora­tion of Amer­ica’s frayed ties with al­lies a top for­eign pol­icy pri­or­ity. But the in­com­ing Amer­i­can leader will face ma­jor hur­dles in places such as the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>In his lat­est strate­gic out­burst, Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte has threat­ened to fully nix the Vis­it­ing Forces Agree­ment (VFA), the back­bone of Philip­pine-US mil­i­tary co­op­er­a­tion cur­rently placed on pro­ba­tion, un­less Wash­ing­ton pro­vides tens of mil­lions of Covid-19 vac­cines.</p>
    <p>“If they are not able to de­liver a min­i­mum of 20 mil­lion vac­cines, they bet­ter get out. No vac­cine, no stay here,” warned the Philip­pine Pres­i­dent last week­end, to the rap­tur­ous ap­plause of his un­der­lings.</p>
    <p>His ear­lier de­ci­sion to ab­ro­gate the cru­cial de­fence deal had been a form of per­sonal re­tal­i­a­tion against the United States</p>
    <p>Congress’ im­po­si­tion of sanc­tions against top hu­man rights vi­o­la­tors in the Philip­pines, in­clud­ing the Pres­i­dent’s key al­lies.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte’s brazen act of strate­gic black­mail­ing drives home the acute na­ture of Mr Bi­den’s for­eign pol­icy dilemma. Fresh into of­fice, the new Amer­i­can ad­min­is­tra­tion will have to find com­mon ground with prickly al­lies such as the Philip­pines, or risk los­ing use­ful as­sets such as ac­cess to key mil­i­tary bases near the dis­puted South China Sea.</p>
    <p>GOOD GOV­ER­NANCE</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s job of re­build­ing al­liances has been made harder in South-east Asia by two in­ter­con­nected and mu­tu­ally re­in­forc­ing trends – demo­cratic back­slid­ing and ris­ing Chi­nese in­flu­ence. In the past four years, the likes of Mr Duterte and Cam­bo­dian Prime Min­is­ter</p>
    <p>Hun Sen have wel­comed Bei­jing’s pa­tron­age while mak­ing the most of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s seem­ing in­dif­fer­ence to the pro­mo­tion of good gov­er­nance prac­tices.</p>
    <p>One of the chief short­com­ings of the Trump pres­i­dency has been its lack of ap­pre­ci­a­tion for the strate­gic im­por­tance of “good gov­er­nance” pro­mo­tion. Even worse, the out­go­ing US Pres­i­dent at times ap­pears to en­dorse prac­tices such as Mr Duterte’s scorched-earth drug war, which has re­port­edly left thou­sands dead in ex­e­cu­tion-style killings.</p>
    <p>In the con­text of the US-China power play in Asia, good gov­er­nance mat­ters be­cause those coun­tries that have proven most vul­ner­a­ble to Bei­jing’s in­flu­ence are of­ten the more au­thor­i­tar­ian and cor­rupt ones.</p>
    <p>For China, hav­ing au­thor­i­tar­ian lead­ers run­ning dys­func­tional regimes as al­lies is use­ful, not least be­cause this elim­i­nates ideational challenges to its iron-fist rule at home. Demo­cratic back­slid­ing hurts Amer­ica’s po­si­tion in Asia, both in terms of its pro­fessed demo­cratic val­ues as well as pure geopo­lit­i­cal interest.</p>
    <p>MIL­I­TARY MAT­TERS</p>
    <p>The Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will find it chal­leng­ing hav­ing to si­mul­ta­ne­ously move on two fronts, namely pro­mo­tion of good gov­er­nance and as­sem­bling a ro­bust, en­dur­ing coali­tion of like-minded pow­ers and al­lies to re­store</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can lead­er­ship and pre­serve a “free and open” se­cu­rity ar­chi­tec­ture in the Indo-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>Ef­fec­tive man­age­ment of the fraught yet cru­cial Philip­pine-US al­liance is cen­tral to the suc­cess of Mr Bi­den’s pol­icy plans for South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Since the end of World War II, the Philip­pines, which has hosted a large Amer­i­can mil­i­tary pres­ence and boasts the most en­dur­ing demo­cratic in­sti­tu­tions, has served as a force mul­ti­plier for</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can pri­macy in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>To put things into per­spec­tive, in 2019, the two al­lies con­ducted 280 joint mil­i­tary ex­er­cises, which was more than the num­ber of ex­er­cises Amer­ica con­ducted with any of its part­ners and al­lies across the en­tire Indo-Pa­cific. Prior to the Covid-19 pan­demic, both coun­tries sched­uled as many as 318 joint mil­i­tary ac­tiv­i­ties, in­clud­ing large-scale war games in the South China Sea, in ad­di­tion to rou­tine humanitari­an as­sis­tance and dis­as­ter re­lief train­ing as well as counter-ter­ror­ism ex­er­cises.</p>
    <p>Un­der the 2014 En­hanced De­fence Co­op­er­a­tion Agree­ment, the Philip­pines of­fered crit­i­cal mil­i­tary bases, namely Basa Air Base and Bautista Air Base, which are close to dis­puted land fea­tures in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>But dis­agree­ments over hu­man rights is­sues, es­pe­cially Mr Duterte’s drug war and as­sault on demo­cratic in­sti­tu­tions, have com­pli­cated plans for ex­panded mar­itime se­cu­rity co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Things came to a head last Fe­bru­ary when Mr Duterte uni­lat­er­ally ini­ti­ated the six-month-long ab­ro­ga­tion of the VFA, which pro­vides the le­gal frame­work for large-scale en­try of Amer­i­can troops onto Philip­pine soil an­nu­ally.</p>
    <p>The con­tro­ver­sial move, which was openly op­posed by top Cabi­net mem­bers and se­nior leg­is­la­tors, came in re­sponse to US Congress-ini­ti­ated sanc­tions against Mr Duterte’s top lieu­tenants, in­clud­ing for­mer police chief and cur­rent Se­na­tor Ron­ald dela Rosa, over their alleged in­volve­ment in gross hu­man rights vi­o­la­tions.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pine mil­i­tary warned that more than half of the sched­uled joint ex­er­cises with the US could be af­fected by</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte’s de­ci­sion, sig­nif­i­cantly un­der­min­ing joint ef­forts at, among other things, coun­ter­ing Chi­nese pres­sure in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>By last June, how­ever, the Philip­pine de­fence es­tab­lish­ment suc­cess­fully re­in­stated the de­fence deal, al­beit tem­po­rar­ily, by sus­pend­ing the VFA ab­ro­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>THE VFA CARD</p>
    <p>Hav­ing openly en­dorsed Mr Trump’s re-elec­tion, Mr Duterte has been con­cerned about a more ag­gres­sive set of sanc­tions with a Demo­cratic pres­i­dent in the White House. As soon as Mr Bi­den’s vic­tory be­came clear, he sig­nalled his de­ter­mi­na­tion to make full use of the VFA card by once again sus­pend­ing the ab­ro­ga­tion of the de­fence deal un­til the mid­dle of this year.</p>
    <p>What this means is that the in­com­ing Amer­i­can pres­i­dent will have to ne­go­ti­ate the fi­nal sta­tus of the de­fence deal only months into of­fice, as part of a broader ef­fort to re­store global al­liances and develop a mul­ti­lat­eral strat­egy to check China’s mar­itime am­bi­tions.</p>
    <p>The out­go­ing Filipino Pres­i­dent, whose con­sti­tu­tional term in of­fice will end in the mid­dle of next year, will al­most cer­tainly seek to ex­tract max­i­mum con­ces­sions from the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion, in­clud­ing as­sur­ances against fur­ther hu­man rights-re­lated sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>In manag­ing its re­la­tions with Manila, it is paramount that the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion pro­mote good gov­er­nance and push back against anoma­lous in­vest­ments by China, em­pha­sis­ing the im­por­tance of rule of law and hu­man rights to the Philip­pines’ po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity and na­tional sovereignt­y.</p>
    <p>This is best done through firm, di­rect yet sub­tle diplo­macy by Mr Bi­den and his top sur­ro­gates to avoid a public re­la­tions melt­down as we saw in the past.</p>
    <p>Good gov­er­nance re­forms should be in­cen­tivised through, among other things, the restora­tion of Mil­len­nium Chal­lenge Cor­po­ra­tion fund­ing, a bi­lat­eral trade and in­vest­ment deal, and tan­gi­ble and sus­tained as­sis­tance for Covid-19 man­age­ment and recovery across South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Rel­a­tively sta­ble bi­lat­eral re­la­tions are cru­cial, be­cause they will al­low the Philip­pines’ de­fence es­tab­lish­ment, which also has a deep scep­ti­cism to­wards China, to more suc­cess­fully lobby for a ro­bust al­liance and a more long-term-ori­ented de­fence pol­icy that tran­scends Mr Duterte’s more nar­row, per­sonal con­cerns over hu­man rights-re­lated sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>The swift and suc­cess­ful restora­tion of the VFA, there­fore, should be part of a broader ef­fort at pro­mot­ing good gov­er­nance, strength­en­ing a cen­tury-old al­liance, and build­ing a mul­ti­lat­eral coali­tion to up­hold the “free and open” or­der in the Indo-Pa­cific.</p>
