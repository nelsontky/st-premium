    <p>The si­lence is deaf­en­ing in Py­ongyang af­ter Mr Joe Bi­den’s vic­tory in the United States pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Per­haps, not sur­pris­ingly, as po­lit­i­cal watch­ers are al­ready spec­u­lat­ing about a shift in US pol­icy to­wards North Korea – to­wards tighter sanc­tions and less per­sonal diplo­macy.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts say Py­ongyang’s re­ac­tion could be a sig­nal of its sol­i­dar­ity with Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, whom North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has met three times since 2018, or per­haps in­di­cates the regime’s pre­oc­cu­pa­tion with the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>What is clear, how­ever, is that it will be care­fully watch­ing the lead­er­ship tran­si­tion in Wash­ing­ton and re­cal­i­brat­ing its po­si­tion in deal­ing with its big­gest “en­emy”.</p>
    <p>What­ever a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion pur­sues, Py­ongyang’s bot­tom line re­mains un­changed – sanc­tions re­lief, eco­nomic aid and can­cel­la­tion of joint mil­i­tary ex­er­cises with South Korea.</p>
    <p>On top of this, it wants to keep its ar­se­nal of nu­clear war­heads and mis­siles in­tact.</p>
    <p>Some ob­servers say North Korea may fire a mis­sile some time around Mr Bi­den’s in­au­gu­ra­tion to test wa­ters, but oth­ers feel the regime may not make any move in the next few months.</p>
    <p>Mr Tae Yong-ho, a for­mer North Korean diplo­mat who de­fected to the South and is now a mem­ber of the Na­tional As­sem­bly in Seoul, be­lieves Py­ongyang is send­ing two mes­sages with its cur­rent stance.</p>
    <p>“First of all, the most im­por­tant thing for Kim Jong Un now is not to pro­tect North Korea from ex­ter­nal mil­i­tary threats, but to pro­tect it from the coro­n­avirus in­va­sion, so if the US does not touch him first, he will re­main quiet dur­ing Bi­den’s pol­icy re­view pe­riod,” said Mr Tae.</p>
    <p>“Next, North Korea wants to con­vey the mes­sage that sanc­tions poli­cies such as Obama’s ‘strate­gic pa­tience’ will not be ef­fec­tive in the fu­ture, given its own self-con­tain­ment pol­icy.”</p>
    <p>‘THUG’ AND ‘RA­BID DOG’</p>
    <p>One can only make an ed­u­cated guess of how the “thug”, as Mr Bi­den has called Mr Kim, and “ra­bid dog”, as North Korean me­dia la­belled Mr Bi­den, may in­ter­act.</p>
    <p>Dr Cheong Seong-chang of the Se­jong In­sti­tute think-tank noted that Mr Bi­den has “con­sis­tently stuck to the view that a sum­mit with Kim would only be pos­si­ble if cer­tain con­di­tions were met”, and that his “ap­par­ent scep­ti­cism to­wards a sum­mit... stems fun­da­men­tally from his view of Kim as a ‘dic­ta­tor’, ‘tyrant’, ‘butcher’ and ‘thug’.”</p>
    <p>This means a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will “likely rely on pres­sure and even stronger sanc­tions” against the North Kore­ans, said Dr Cheong.</p>
    <p>Mr Kim has kept mum for now but Mr Tae said North Korea has been “analysing Bi­den for a very long time”.</p>
    <p>The US Pres­i­dent-elect’s pre­vi­ous ex­pe­ri­ence in ne­go­ti­at­ing for arms re­duc­tion with the for­mer Soviet Union means that he would be in­ter­ested in such dis­cus­sions with North Korea too, said the for­mer North Korean diplo­mat.</p>
    <p>He added that Py­ongyang’s in­ter­est in arms re­duc­tion ne­go­ti­a­tions, as op­posed to aban­don­ing all of its nu­clear weapons, was ap­par­ent from a state­ment on July 10 by Mr Kim’s sis­ter Yo Jong, who is now widely re­garded as a pow­er­ful fig­ure in the North Korean hi­er­ar­chy, per­haps sec­ond only to her brother. She said “it would be eas­ier and more favourable for the US to rack its brains to make our nukes no threat to them, rather than for us to dis­pose of our nukes”.</p>
    <p>THE NU­CLEAR THREAT</p>
    <p>North Korea’s nu­clear threat ap­pears to have di­min­ished this year, com­pared with 2016 when then newly elected Mr Trump heard from his pre­de­ces­sor, Mr Barack Obama, that it could be the most press­ing dan­ger he would face in his pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>Py­ongyang had by then con­ducted two nu­clear tests and fired 24 mis­siles, and these were fol­lowed up with its first test of an in­ter-con­ti­nen­tal bal­lis­tic mis­sile (ICBM) in 2017.</p>
    <p>Af­ter three Trump-Kim sum­mits, nu­mer­ous “love let­ters” be­tween them, as Mr Trump trum­peted, and one agree­ment to “work to­wards com­plete de­nu­cle­ari­sa­tion”, North Korea has re­scinded on ICBM tests, fir­ing only nine short-range mis­siles so far this year.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts es­ti­mate that the regime now has more than 60 nu­clear weapons.</p>
    <p>Mr Michael Madden, a North Korea lead­er­ship ex­pert at the USbased Stim­son Cen­tre, told The Straits Times that the regime may be less in­clined to use a nu­clear weapon now, but its nu­clear threat has ac­tu­ally in­ten­si­fied as the past few years “al­lowed the re­search and de­vel­op­ment arm am­ple time to im­prove tech­ni­cal and the­o­ret­i­cal ca­pa­bil­i­ties”.</p>
    <p>“Out of this re­search and de­vel­op­ment space, we get the weapons sys­tems we saw pa­raded through Kim Il Sung Square back in Oc­to­ber,” he added, re­fer­ring to a new ICBM that ex­perts noted is larger than the pre­vi­ously tested Hwa­song-15.</p>
    <p>Sum­mit diplo­macy was a “wor­thy at­tempt” but it did not go any­where, said Mr Greg Scar­la­toiu, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of The Com­mit­tee for Hu­man Rights in North Korea.</p>
    <p>“A Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion would likely fo­cus on pres­sure... while per­haps con­sid­er­ing a re­sus­ci­ta­tion of the six-party talks for­mat,” he added, re­fer­ring to the 2003-2007 nu­clear talks in­volv­ing the US, China, Rus­sia, Ja­pan and the two Koreas.</p>
    <p>A scaled-down ver­sion in­volv­ing the US, China and the two Koreas would also work, said Dr Cheong from Se­jong In­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>SOUTH KOREA’S ROLE</p>
    <p>South Korea’s role in talks with the North is also im­por­tant, ex­perts said.</p>
    <p>“North Korea will now have more use for (South Korean) Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in, as Kim will no longer have his own per­sonal diplo­macy hot­line to the White House,” said Asian pol­i­tics ex­pert Sean King from Wash­ing­ton-based con­sult­ing firm Park Strate­gies.</p>
    <p>“The Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will be more about process and al­liances, which means Py­ongyang will again have to spend time and en­ergy go­ing through Seoul to get to the US.”</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts say the Moon ad­min­is­tra­tion is even try­ing to mend ties with Ja­pan that soured over wartime forced labour is­sues, wor­ried that ten­sion with Tokyo could jeop­ar­dise their al­liance with Wash­ing­ton, given Mr Bi­den’s pref­er­ence for mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism and boost­ing US al­liances in Asia.</p>
    <p>The good news for Seoul is that Mr Bi­den, un­like his pre­de­ces­sor, will prob­a­bly de­mand “more mod­est in­creases” in stalled de­fence cost-shar­ing talks with­out threat­en­ing to with­draw US troops, noted Ewha Wo­mans Univer­sity’s as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of in­ter­na­tional stud­ies Leif-Eric Easley.</p>
    <p>He added that the US and its al­lies will “need to co­or­di­nate re­sponses” to North Korea “so South Korea and Ja­pan should han­dle dif­fi­cult his­tory is­sues more re­spon­si­bly to pre­vent dis­rup­tions to co­op­er­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>Mr Madden said the first six months of next year will be “a pe­riod where we test North Korean in­ten­tions and our as­sump­tions about them”.</p>
    <p>“If North Korea does not con­duct high-pro­file test ac­tiv­ity and gives Bi­den some space to shore up al­liances, that means the North is will­ing to en­gage in ne­go­ti­a­tions and thinks there is a good prob­a­bil­ity of at­tain­ing an agree­ment with the US,” he said.</p>
    <p>“How Bi­den and Moon, and the US and South Korea in­ter­act, and what they say will be a ma­jor fac­tor in Kim Jong Un’s de­ci­sion,” he added.</p>
