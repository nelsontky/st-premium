    <p>As­so­ci­ate edi­tor Chua Mui Hoong makes valid points in her com­men­tary (Racism in Sin­ga­pore: Time to lis­ten to mi­nori­ties’ con­cerns, Dec 25). The use of ra­cial stereo­types and racist state­ments do hurt vic­tims – that much is not con­tentious.</p>
    <p>Whether this sen­ti­ment is a prod­uct of “wokeism” is ir­rel­e­vant – we as mem­bers of a civil so­ci­ety must play our part to be con­scious of what we say, and to en­sure that we re­mind oth­ers who may make racist state­ments that what they are do­ing is wrong.</p>
    <p>How­ever, to say that an ac­tion is wrong is not to say that it is il­le­gal (which is what “vi­o­lent” con­duct is). Hurt feel­ings do not ipso facto jus­tify pun­ish­ment by the law. Therein lies the dan­ger of us­ing the word “vi­o­lence” to de­scribe racist speech which hurts the feel­ings of its sub­ject.</p>
    <p>Ar­ti­cle 14 of the Con­sti­tu­tion pro­tects the in­di­vid­ual’s right to free­dom of speech. There are, how­ever, sig­nif­i­cant qual­i­fi­ca­tions to this right (such as for defama­tion, con­tempt of court, pub­lic or­der and moral­ity). These qual­i­fi­ca­tions are ex­haus­tive, and rightly so since they stand in opposition with the fun­da­men­tal right to free­dom of speech.</p>
    <p>To say that racist speech con­sti­tutes “vi­o­lence” is to say that it should be pro­hib­ited by law (rather than merely be so­cially dis­ap­proved of).</p>
    <p>If the ba­sis for clas­si­fy­ing racist speech as “vi­o­lence” is the hurt feel­ings of its vic­tims, this would be the first step into erod­ing what’s left of the right to free­dom of speech.</p>
    <p>The cor­rect so­lu­tion is not a le­gal one. A col­lec­tive ex­pres­sion of dis­ap­proval and a ro­bust dis­cus­sion of this is­sue, as Ms Chua sug­gests, is the way to go.</p>
