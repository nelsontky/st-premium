    <p>•</p>
    <p>ROME Ital­ians headed to the polls yes­ter­day – to the alarm of coro­n­avirus ex­perts – for a ref­er­en­dum and re­gional elec­tions that could weaken the gov­ern­ment and rad­i­cally re­shape the po­lit­i­cal land­scape.</p>
    <p>Just a week af­ter a Her­culean ef­fort by schools to re­open in line with last-minute Covid-19 rules, class­rooms across the coun­try were shut to stu­dents and trans­formed into bal­lot sta­tions for the two-day vote.</p>
    <p>A tri­umph for the far right in this fiercely fought cam­paign would sound alarm bells in Brus­sels.</p>
    <p>Exit polls are due when polling sta­tions close at 3pm today, with ref­er­en­dum and re­gional re­sults ex­pected in the af­ter­noon and evening.</p>
    <p>It will be the first test for Prime Min­is­ter Giuseppe Conte’s cen­treleft coali­tion gov­ern­ment since it im­posed an eco­nom­i­cally crip­pling na­tion­wide lock­down to fight the coro­n­avirus, which has killed al­most 36,000 peo­ple in Italy.</p>
    <p>The ref­er­en­dum, on slash­ing the num­ber of MPs – from 630 to 400 in the Lower House, and 315 to 200 in the Up­per House – is ex­pected to pass, though there has been a late uptick in the num­ber of prom­i­nent</p>
    <p>“no” dec­la­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>A “no” vote on the ref­er­en­dum would dam­age the co-gov­ern­ing Five Star Move­ment (M5S), which is al­ready haem­or­rhag­ing voter sup­port, though other par­ties – in­clud­ing its coali­tion part­ner, the Demo­cratic Party (PD) – have backed the mea­sure as well.</p>
    <p>The cost-cut­ting re­form is the brain­child of M5S, but while PD and par­ties on the right are the­o­ret­i­cally in favour, their sup­port has been lack­lus­tre at best.</p>
    <p>The re­gional bat­tle is for gov­er­nance of Cam­pa­nia, Lig­uria, Marche, Puglia, Tus­cany, Valle d’Aosta and Veneto.</p>
    <p>The right-wing coali­tion is set to eas­ily re­take Veneto and Lig­uria, and it could also snatch Marche and Puglia from the left.</p>
    <p>But all eyes will be on Tus­cany, a his­tor­i­cally left-wing strong­hold that might fall to Mr Mat­teo Salvini’s far-right North­ern League party.</p>
    <p>“If the left per­forms par­tic­u­larly poorly... Brus­sels will grow con­cerned,” Beren­berg econ­o­mist Flo­rian Hense said.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Union will worry whether the national re­cov­ery plan</p>
    <p>Italy has to present – to ob­tain grants or loans to aid its ail­ing econ­omy af­ter the coro­n­avirus lock­down – “will be am­bi­tious enough, given the lim­ited po­lit­i­cal cap­i­tal of the coali­tion in Rome”, he said.</p>
    <p>“And whether, what­ever plan Italy comes up with, it will ac­tu­ally im­ple­ment it, given the un­cer­tain fu­ture of the cur­rent coali­tion.”</p>
    <p>The poll is go­ing ahead de­spite warn­ings against open­ing polling sta­tions while Covid-19 case num­bers are on the rise.</p>
    <p>While Italy cur­rently has fewer new cases than Bri­tain, France or Spain, it is still record­ing more than 1,500 daily.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Massimo Galli, in­fec­tious dis­eases chief at Mi­lan’s Sacco hos­pi­tal, said: “The coun­try is in a state of emer­gency; it is ut­terly con­tra­dic­tory to be mass­ing peo­ple to­gether at polling sta­tions, par­tic­u­larly in the light of the trend in Europe.”</p>
    <p>He said pre­vi­ously that hold­ing the elec­tions now would be “mad­ness”.</p>
    <p>Some pre­cau­tions have been taken, how­ever, with el­derly and preg­nant vot­ers get­ting fast-track lanes to vote.</p>
    <p>With older peo­ple po­ten­tially put off vot­ing be­cause of the health risks, the left has been or­gan­is­ing spe­cial trans­port. One in three vot­ers for the PD and the League are over 65 years old, ac­cord­ing to Italy’s Cor­riere della Sera daily.</p>
    <p>Nearly 2,000 vot­ers in iso­la­tion due to the coro­n­avirus have also reg­is­tered to have their votes col­lected, in­clud­ing for­mer prime min­is­ter Sil­vio Ber­lus­coni.</p>
    <p>But fear of catch­ing the virus from vot­ers obliged to pull down their masks to al­low them­selves to be iden­ti­fied has seen a flurry of last-minute de­ser­tions by polling sta­tion vol­un­teers.</p>
    <p>On Satur­day, Mi­lan was forced to ur­gently call for 100 fresh pairs of hands.</p>
    <p>Mr Conte has clinched a be­hind­doors deal with PD leader Ni­cola Zin­garetti to fight to save each other’s po­lit­i­cal skins should the left per­form dis­as­trously, ac­cord­ing to the Repub­blica daily.</p>
    <p>That might not be enough. Po­lit­i­cal com­men­ta­tor Bar­bara Fi­ammeri for Italy’s Sole 24 Ore daily said: “Th­ese elec­tions are not go­ing to top­ple the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>“But there could well be a cri­sis, whether it be Conte’s fall, the form­ing of a new coali­tion, or even a national unity gov­ern­ment.”</p>
