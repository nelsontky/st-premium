    <p>Barcelona cap­tain Lionel Messi has ad­mit­ted he has found it tough to play with­out fans since March due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, liken­ing the ex­pe­ri­ence to a train­ing ses­sion.</p>
    <p>“It’s hor­ri­ble to play with­out fans, it’s a very ugly sen­sa­tion,” the Ar­gentina for­ward told Span­ish news­pa­per Marca on Mon­day af­ter re­ceiv­ing the Pichichi award for the top scorer in La Liga last sea­son with 25 goals. “See­ing no one in the sta­dium is like a train­ing ses­sion and it is very tough to re­ally get go­ing at the start of a game.”</p>
    <p>The new nor­mal of football in empty sta­di­ums has cer­tainly taken its toll on Messi and Barca.</p>
    <p>The Cata­lans were top of La Liga with 11 games to go when last sea­son was dis­rupted by the pan­demic and they sur­ren­dered the ti­tle to Real Madrid when play re­sumed be­hind closed doors.</p>
    <p>They then suf­fered a record 8-2 de­feat by Bay­ern Mu­nich in the Cham­pi­ons League in an empty Es­ta­dio da Luz in Lis­bon in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>This sea­son, they have made their worst start in 33 years and were fifth in La Liga be­fore yes­ter­day’s games, way off the pace of lead­ers Atletico Madrid, while they failed to fin­ish top of their Cham­pi­ons League group for the first time since 2006.</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old Messi, mean­while, is hav­ing his worst in­di­vid­ual sea­son since the 2007-08 cam­paign, scor­ing only nine goals in all com­pe­ti­tions, five of which have been penal­ties.</p>
    <p>“The truth is it’s very ugly and that’s why we are see­ing such evenly matched games. It’s very dif­fi­cult to win, re­gard­less of who you are play­ing against,” he added.</p>
    <p>“The pan­demic has caused football to change a lot, and for the worse. You can see it i n the matches, and I hope this ends soon and we can get fans back into the sta­di­ums and re­turn to nor­mal­ity.”</p>
    <p>Sup­port­ers have been ab­sent from top-flight games since March but are set to re­turn from April once a large sec­tion of Spain’s pop­u­la­tion has been vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to lo­cal me­dia, the first game with fans will be last sea­son’s post­poned King’s Cup fi­nal between Real So­ciedad and Ath­letic Bil­bao, due to take place on April 4.</p>
    <p>But the lack of an ador­ing Nou Camp crowd is not the only thing that is weigh­ing Messi down.</p>
    <p>Ad­mit­ting his failed at­tempt to leave the club in Au­gust had left an ill feel­ing that he is only be­gin­ning to shake off, he told Span­ish TV chan­nel LaSexta: “Ev­ery­thing that hap­pened be­fore the sum­mer, how the sea­son ended, then the buro­fax... I dragged ev­ery­thing into the start of the sea­son a bit.</p>
    <p>“The truth is right now, I’m feel­ing fine but in the sum­mer, I had a very bad time. I know the club is in a dif­fi­cult mo­ment and ev­ery­thing sur­round­ing Barca right now is dif­fi­cult, but I’m feel­ing ex­cited.”</p>
    <p>He has less than seven months left on his deal and will be able to ne­go­ti­ate with other clubs from next month.</p>
