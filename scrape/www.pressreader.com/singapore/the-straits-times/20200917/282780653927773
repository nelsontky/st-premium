    <p>Tai­wanese host, singer and ac­tor Alien Huang has died at the age of 36, ac­cord­ing to Tai­wanese me­dia.</p>
    <p>Huang, who was fa­mous for co­host­ing the long-run­ning va­ri­ety pro­gramme 100% En­ter­tain­ment with singer Show Lo, was found dead at his home in Beitou district, Taipei, yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Taiwan’s Ap­ple Daily, Huang returned home at about 10pm on Tues­day. There was no one at home at the time.</p>
    <p>He was found ly­ing half-dressed in the hall­way near the bath­room by his fa­ther, who was look­ing for him to have lunch to­gether, at about 11am yes­ter­day. There were some ex­ter­nal in­juries on Huang’s head and some blood stains on the floor.</p>
    <p>He was pro­nounced dead by the paramedics who ar­rived at the scene. The po­lice did not find any drugs, wine bot­tles or signs of strug­gle on the premises.</p>
    <p>Pre­lim­i­nary in­ves­ti­ga­tions show that he died after slip­ping near the bath­room.</p>
    <p>Huang, who had dated singer Rainie Yang in the past, was re­cently ro­man­ti­cally linked to Tai­wanese cheer­leader Wu Han-chun.</p>
    <p>He was for­merly part of Ja­panese-Tai­wanese boy band HC3 in 2002 and Tai­wanese boy band Cosmo in 2003. Both groups have dis­banded.</p>
    <p>He be­gan co-host­ing 100% En­ter­tain­ment in 2006 and was nom­i­nated for Best Host in a Va­ri­ety Pro­gramme with Lo at Taiwan’s Golden Bell Awards in 2015.</p>
    <p>He quit co-host­ing the show in Jan­uary 2016 to fo­cus on his singing and act­ing ca­reer.</p>
    <p>As an ac­tor, he has starred in</p>
    <p>Tai­wanese movies such as Din Tao: Leader Of The Pa­rade (2012) and Go! Crazy Gang­ster (2016).</p>
    <p>He has also acted in sev­eral Sin­ga­pore pro­duc­tions – Chan­nel 8 pe­riod drama Joys Of Life (2012) and ac­tress-di­rec­tor Michelle Chong’s film Al­ready Fa­mous (2011).</p>
    <p>Chong paid trib­ute to him yes­ter­day as she posted sev­eral pho­tos of her with Huang on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>She wrote in Chi­nese: “Un­be­liev­able. ‘You will al­ways be the first lead­ing man in my life.’ RIP.”</p>
    <p>His mu­sic la­bel Rock Records is­sued a state­ment which said: “Alien, hope on your own planet, you can do the mu­sic you want to do and in­dulge in your pas­sion for draw­ing.”</p>
    <p>Huang is the third artist to die at 36 in the last three days. Both South Korean ac­tress Oh In-hye and Ja­panese ac­tress Sei Ashina died of sus­pected sui­cide on Mon­day.</p>
