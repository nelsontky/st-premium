    <p>The PAP’s fourth-gen­er­a­tion team is fo­cused on tack­ling the chal­lenges Sin­ga­pore faces amid the pre­sent cri­sis and does not plan to change its back­ing of Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat as their leader.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to a ques­tion on whether the 4G lead­ers had dis­cussed or re­viewed their po­si­tion on this mat­ter, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said they had not dis­cussed this – and did not plan to.</p>
    <p>“We’re en­tirely fo­cused on help­ing our coun­try over­come the eco­nomic chal­lenges and sav­ing jobs at this point in time,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We have no plans to do oth­er­wise and we have no plans, no dis­cus­sion on any change in plan.”</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong had re­ferred the ques­tion posed by the me­dia to him to Mr Chan, who is Mr Heng’s deputy on the 4G team.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng has been widely ex­pected to take over the premier­ship from PM Lee, af­ter he was ap­pointed as the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party’s first as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral in 2018 and sub­se­quently as Deputy Prime Min­is­ter last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng, in turn, had asked Mr Chan to be his deputy, and Mr Chan was ap­pointed the PAP’s sec­ond as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral in 2018.</p>
    <p>Some ob­servers had com­mented on whether the lead­er­ship suc­ces­sion should be relooked, af­ter the PAP team led by Mr Heng got 53.4 per cent of the vote against a Work­ers’ Party team in East Coast GRC.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, PM Lee ac­knowl­edged that whether he will be able to hand over the reins to his suc­ces­sor by the time he turns 70 in 2022, as he had ini­tially hoped, will de­pend on how quickly the Covid-19 pan­demic can be brought un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>Asked if he saw him­self con­tin­u­ing as Prime Min­is­ter be­yond 70, he said: “I do not de­ter­mine the path of the Covid-19 pan­demic, and a lot will de­pend on how events un­fold.</p>
    <p>“And all I can say is, I will see this through and I’ll hand over in good shape as soon as pos­si­ble to the next team and into good hands.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee also said he had to main­tain a greater de­gree of con­ti­nu­ity in Cabi­net than he would oth­er­wise have done, be­cause of the “ex­is­ten­tial” and “over­whelm­ing” cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has to put all hands on deck and mo­bilise all the ex­pe­ri­ence and ca­pa­bil­i­ties it can muster to deal with the pan­demic, he added.</p>
    <p>“I have kept on many of my older col­leagues who are par­tic­i­pat­ing in this fight against Covid-19 and in sta­bil­is­ing our econ­omy, my Se­nior Min­is­ters, the other older min­is­ters who have been in the team, and re­in­forced by younger ones,” he said.</p>
    <p>This is also why the min­is­ters who have been di­rectly han­dling Covid-19 have been kept in place, said PM Lee. Mr Gan Kim Yong will stay on as Health Min­is­ter and con­tinue to co-chair the multi-min­istry task force on Covid-19 with Mr Lawrence Wong, who takes on a new port­fo­lio as Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter. Mr Chan Chun Sing will re­main as Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter and</p>
    <p>Mrs Josephine Teo as Man­power Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ters of de­fence, for­eign af­fairs, home af­fairs, law and com­mu­ni­ca­tions and in­for­ma­tion will stay in place as well.</p>
    <p>PM Lee de­scribed his Cabi­net as hav­ing a good mix of ex­pe­ri­ence and ideas, that will bring Sin­ga­pore through the Covid-19 cri­sis and be­yond. “I hope that within not too long a time, as the sit­u­a­tion sta­bilises and we get on top of it, it will be pos­si­ble for me to make fur­ther changes,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Prime Min­is­ter also re­it­er­ated an ear­lier pledge to see Sin­ga­pore through the cri­sis, adding: “I will hand over Sin­ga­pore in good work­ing or­der into the good hands of my suc­ces­sors as soon as that is pos­si­ble.”</p>
