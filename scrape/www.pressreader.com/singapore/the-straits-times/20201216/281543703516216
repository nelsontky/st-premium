    <p>The United States’ Covid-19 death toll soared past 300,000 on Mon­day, as the na­tion em­barked on a mass vac­ci­na­tion cam­paign. This comes less than four weeks af­ter its death toll reached a quar­ter-mil­lion. With in­fec­tions surg­ing rapidly, ex­perts say it may take just an­other month to record the next 100,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASHINGTON The num­ber of peo­ple who have died of the coron­avirus in the United States passed 300,000 on Mon­day, as the na­tion started to roll out a mass vac­ci­na­tion cam­paign against the deadly dis­ease.</p>
    <p>The wrench­ing record comes less than four weeks af­ter the coun­try’s Covid-19 death toll reached a quar­ter of a mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The surge in deaths re­flects how much faster Amer­i­cans have spread the virus to one an­other since late Septem­ber, when the num­ber of cases iden­ti­fied daily was be­low 40,000.</p>
    <p>A range of fac­tors – in­clud­ing fi­nan­cial pres­sure to re­turn to work­places, the politi­ci­sa­tion of maskwear­ing and a col­lec­tive sur­ren­der to the de­sire for so­cial con­tact – has since driven new cases to more than 200,000 a day.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts say pre­ventable deaths on a stag­ger­ing scale are sure to fol­low. Al­most the same num­ber of Amer­i­cans are now be­ing lost to the dis­ease each day as were killed in the Sept 11 ter­ror at­tacks or the at­tack on Pearl Har­bour.</p>
    <p>“There’s no need for that many to have died,” said pro­fes­sor of medicine David Hayes-Bautista from the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, Los An­ge­les. “We chose, as a coun­try, to take our foot off the gas pedal. We chose to, and that’s the tragedy.”</p>
    <p>Three hun­dred thou­sand is more than the num­ber of Amer­i­cans who died fight­ing in World War II.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has al­ready sur­passed heart dis­ease as the lead­ing cause of death in Amer­ica, Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion (CDC) di­rec­tor Robert Red­field said in pub­lic re­marks last week. But the worst is yet to come.</p>
    <p>The first 100,000 US deaths were con­firmed by May 27; it then took four months for the na­tion to</p>
    <p>U.S. DEATH TOLL</p>
    <p>log an­other 100,000 deaths. The lat­est 100,000 deaths oc­curred over a span of about three months.</p>
    <p>The next 100,000 Amer­i­cans to die, many pub­lic health ex­perts be­lieve, may do so in closer to one month.</p>
    <p>“I am floored at how much worse it is than what I ex­pected,” said Pro­fes­sor Ashish Jha, dean of Brown Univer­sity’s School of Pub­lic Health.</p>
    <p>The only glim­mer of hope is that Amer­i­cans are now start­ing to get vac­ci­nated against the virus.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can drug maker Pfizer and its part­ners de­liv­ered the first Covid-19 vac­cines to 141 of 145 lo­ca­tions tar­geted by the US govern­ment for the first day of a na­tion­wide roll-out of the mass in­oc­u­la­tion cam­paign on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Health­care fa­cil­i­ties in four is­land ter­ri­to­ries – Amer­i­can Samoa, the US Vir­gin Is­lands, the North Mar­i­ana Is­lands and Guam – are still await­ing their sup­plies, a De­part­ment of Health and Hu­man Ser­vices (HHS) spokesman said.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine de­vel­oped by Pfizer and its Ger­man part­ner BioNTech was au­tho­rised by US reg­u­la­tors for emer­gency use last Fri­day, and the first ship­ments were sent out on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The US govern­ment is aim­ing to dis­trib­ute the first wave of 2.9 mil­lion vac­cine doses to 636 lo­ca­tions na­tion­wide by the end of the week.</p>
    <p>US Army Gen­eral Gus­tave Perna said se­vere storms ex­pected in some parts of the coun­try this week could pose chal­lenges to vac­cine ship­ments.</p>
    <p>Fed­eral of­fi­cials are in talks with Pfizer to ac­quire ad­di­tional vac­cine doses be­yond the 100 mil­lion that the US has al­ready pur­chased, Oper­a­tion Warp Speed chief ad­viser Mon­cef Slaoui said.</p>
    <p>HHS Sec­re­tary Alex Azar said the CDC had pro­vided US$145 mil­lion (S$193 mil­lion) to states to help with the dis­tri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>“Lit­er­ally mil­lions of doses right now are get­ting out there to the Amer­i­can peo­ple. And by next week, we be­lieve we could be hav­ing a sec­ond vac­cine,” Mr Azar said at Ge­orge Washington Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal as part of a vac­ci­na­tion kick-off event.</p>
    <p>“By the end of Fe­bru­ary, what you saw to­day could be repli­cated a 100 mil­lion times.”</p>
    <p>Most doses de­liv­ered in the US will be sourced from Pfizer’s USbased man­u­fac­tur­ing fa­cil­i­ties, in­clud­ing its fac­tory in Kala­ma­zoo, Michi­gan.</p>
    <p>Some of the ini­tial doses were sourced from a fa­cil­ity in Bel­gium, Gen Perna said.</p>
    <p>US of­fi­cials are hop­ing Moderna’s vac­cine, which is be­ing re­viewed by US reg­u­la­tors, will be avail­able for dis­tri­bu­tion as early as the start of next week, he added.</p>
    <p>As­traZeneca has en­rolled 22,000 peo­ple in US clin­i­cal tri­als for its vac­cine and could sub­mit its ap­pli­ca­tion for emer­gency au­tho­ri­sa­tion as soon as next Fe­bru­ary, Dr Slaoui said.</p>
    <p>I am floored at how much worse it is than what I ex­pected.</p>
