    <p>LARGER IS­SUE</p>
    <p>The fo­cus of the prob­lem is not that CFIUS (Com­mit­tee on For­eign In­vest­ment in the United States) forced the sale... the real pur­pose (of the ad­min­is­tra­tion) was for a com­pre­hen­sive ban and more.</p>
    <p>’’ MR ZHANG YIM­ING, the founder of ByteDance which owns TikTok.</p>
    <p>The US gov­ern­ment did not aim to force the sale of TikTok but rather wanted to ban it, the owner of the short video-shar­ing app has said.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhang Yim­ing, the founder of ByteDance which owns TikTok, said in a sec­ond let­ter to em­ploy­ees in as many days that it is pre­pared for fur­ther dif­fi­cul­ties as he per­son­ally came un­der at­tack from Chi­nese na­tion­al­ists who have ac­cused him of be­ing a traitor.</p>
    <p>TikTok is in the midst of ne­go­ti­at­ing a sale to Mi­crosoft af­ter Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump threat­ened it with an out­right ban in the United States, cit­ing na­tional se­cu­rity rea­sons, un­less the com­pany is sold to an Amer­i­can firm.</p>
    <p>“The fo­cus of the prob­lem is not that CFIUS (Com­mit­tee on For­eign In­vest­ment in the United States) forced the sale... the real pur­pose (of the ad­min­is­tra­tion) was for a com­pre­hen­sive ban and more,” Mr Zhang wrote in the let­ter ad­dressed to the Chi­nese staff of ByteDance.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has gone to great lengths to sep­a­rate TikTok’s in­ter­na­tional op­er­a­tions from the Chi­nese part of the firm, which runs Douyin and Jinri Toutiao, a news ag­gre­ga­tor that dou­bles as a so­cial net­work­ing site.</p>
    <p>In the let­ter, Mr Zhang re­ferred to the per­sonal at­tacks he has re­ceived on Weibo for ap­pear­ing to bow to Amer­i­can pres­sure, in­clud­ing old posts where he spoke highly of the US sys­tem. He has now deleted all his so­cial me­dia posts.</p>
    <p>“I ac­tu­ally un­der­stand that peo­ple have high ex­pec­ta­tions for a Chi­nese com­pany go­ing global,” he wrote. “Fur­ther­more, peo­ple have a lot of griev­ances now of the US gov­ern­ment, so it is easy to crit­i­cise us very fiercely.”</p>
    <p>But off­line, Bei­jing has leapt to TikTok’s de­fence, ac­cus­ing the US of “out­right bul­ly­ing” and call­ing its ac­tions tan­ta­mount to theft.</p>
    <p>“(The forced sale) goes against the prin­ci­ples of the mar­ket econ­omy and the (World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s) prin­ci­ples of open­ness, trans­parency and non-dis­crim­i­na­tion,” said Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin.</p>
    <p>“The US, with­out pro­vid­ing any ev­i­dence, has been us­ing an abused con­cept of na­tional se­cu­rity... un­jus­ti­fi­ably sup­press­ing cer­tain non-US com­pa­nies,” he said.</p>
    <p>The na­tional se­cu­rity grounds for Wash­ing­ton’s clam­p­down on Chi­nese firms “do not hold wa­ter”, and Chi­nese com­pa­nies con­duct busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties in ac­cor­dance with in­ter­na­tional rules and US laws, Mr Wang said.</p>
    <p>“But the US is crack­ing down on them on trumped-up charges. This is all po­lit­i­cal ma­nip­u­la­tion,” added Mr Wang, warn­ing Wash­ing­ton not to “open Pan­dora’s box”.</p>
    <p>“As TikTok’s ex­pe­ri­ence shows, no mat­ter how un­founded the claims against them are, as long as they re­main Chi­nese com­pa­nies, they will be pre­sented as be­ing a ‘Red threat’ by the ad­min­is­tra­tion,” the of­fi­cial China Daily wrote in an ed­i­to­rial, call­ing the move of­fi­cially sanc­tioned theft.</p>
    <p>“But China will by no means ac­cept the ‘theft’ of a Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy com­pany, and it has plenty of ways to re­spond if the ad­min­is­tra­tion car­ries out its planned smash and grab,” it added.</p>
