    <p>While the pan­demic has kept us all cooped up in Sin­ga­pore with lit­tle prospect of travel, in­vest­ment ex­pert David Mok says that ad­vances in tech­nol­ogy mean it has never been eas­ier for in­vestors to go global.</p>
    <p>As he tells his clients, a click of the mouse can open in­vest­ment doors across the world, vastly ex­pand­ing the hori­zons for peo­ple look­ing for new money-mak­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>“We are for­tu­nate to be liv­ing in the In­ter­net age, (which) has won­der­fully democra­tised the ac­cess to stocks for the man on the street,” says Mr Mok, 54.</p>
    <p>“(Thus), we can in­vest in stocks of coun­tries glob­ally from the com­fort of home.”</p>
    <p>He adds that tech­nol­ogy has also al­lowed him to shape his in­vest­ment strat­egy and di­ver­sify his port­fo­lio.</p>
    <p>“Fo­cus­ing on Sin­ga­pore stocks may not be op­ti­mal as it ex­poses us to spe­cific risks from a sin­gle coun­try – as this Covid-19 pan­demic has plainly re­vealed.</p>
    <p>“Go­ing global al­lows us to cap­i­talise on the growth of other na­tions and re­gions.”</p>
    <p>Mr Mok, the head of in­vest­ment and re­search at IPP Fi­nan­cial Ad­vis­ers here, prac­tised what he preaches in March when he in­vested in ex­change-traded funds on Wall Street’s Dow, S&P 500 and Nas­daq.</p>
    <p>His go-global strat­egy can also mean buy­ing into funds that in­vest in places like Amer­ica, Europe and Asia, he says, adding that peo­ple can also buy ex­change-traded funds of the re­spec­tive re­gions.</p>
    <p>This ap­proach also un­der­pins the per­for­mance of model port­fo­lios for his clients at IPP.</p>
    <p>The com­pany started in 1983 and now has a staff and sales strength of 400, serv­ing more than 50,000 clients with al­most $1.5 bil­lion in as­sets un­der ad­vi­sory.</p>
    <p>It of­fers ex­per­tise in wealth plan­ning, ad­vance in­surance plan­ning and global in­vest­ment ad­vi­sory ser­vices. Its ser­vices in­clude help­ing clients in re­tire­ment and legacy plan­ning, as well as business con­ti­nu­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Mok is also re­spon­si­ble for the firm’s in-house pro­pri­etary model port­fo­lio, called Ea­gle Eye.</p>
    <p>He han­dles fund man­age­ment and over­sees over­all in­vest­ment strat­egy and as­set al­lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The firm is al­ready present in Malaysia and Hong Kong, and plans to ex­pand fur­ther into the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Mr Mok is mar­ried to a civil ser­vant. They have three boys and a fos­ter daugh­ter, with ages rang­ing from 18 to 23.</p>
    <p>He holds a Mas­ter of Business Ad­min­is­tra­tion de­gree from the Univer­sity of Maryland. Q What’s in your port­fo­lio? A My port­fo­lio con­sists of prop­erty and eq­ui­ties. The eq­ui­ties are Sin­ga­pore-listed real-es­tate in­vest­ment trusts for in­come.</p>
    <p>The port­fo­lio is largely prop­erty, given the quan­tum re­quired to pur­chase the as­set class.</p>
    <p>I hold 90 per cent in prop­erty and 10 per cent in eq­ui­ties.</p>
    <p>Our port­fo­lio for clients is also largely made up of equity and fixed-in­come funds.</p>
    <p>Our equity and fixed-in­come funds largely re­flect the shape and com­po­si­tion of global in­dexes.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, if the global equity in­dex com­prises 50 per cent from the North Amer­i­can markets, our model port­fo­lio will re­flect a sim­i­lar com­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>We main­tain more than 20 dif­fer­ent port­fo­lios, cater­ing to our clients’ var­ied needs and ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>One main con­sid­er­a­tion is a client’s risk ap­petite.</p>
    <p>If the clients have a con­ser­va­tive risk ap­petite, we are likely to match them with a 20 per cent al­lo­ca­tion to eq­ui­ties and 80 per cent to fixed in­come.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, if the client has a more ag­gres­sive risk ap­petite, we are likely to match that with 80 per cent al­lo­ca­tion to equity, with the re­main­ing in fixed in­come.</p>
    <p>Q What are your im­me­di­ate in­vest­ment plans?</p>
    <p>A We are in the mid­dle of a pan­demic. Economies around the world are still reel­ing from the shock of se­vere public health mea­sures im­posed by their re­spec­tive gov­ern­ments.</p>
    <p>All across the world, gross do­mes­tic prod­uct fig­ures have plunged and un­em­ploy­ment rates soared.</p>
    <p>Whether eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity will re­turn to pre-Covid-19 lev­els in the near term re­mains un­cer­tain.</p>
    <p>That said, the stock mar­ket has sur­pris­ingly re­cov­ered in a Vshaped man­ner.</p>
    <p>There ap­pears to be a di­ver­gence be­tween the cur­rent eco­nomic re­al­ity and the ex­pec­ta­tion-loaded stock mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Pre­sented with this dilemma, our im­me­di­ate strat­egy is not to take on more risk but to main­tain a neu­tral po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Q How did you get in­ter­ested in in­vest­ing?</p>
    <p>A I got in­ter­ested when I re­alised that in­vest­ing in the mod­ern age is as es­sen­tial as grow­ing crops in the agrar­ian age.</p>
    <p>It is an es­sen­tial skill set ev­ery­one needs to know and prac­tise to store up grain for our win­ter years.</p>
    <p>In­fla­tion is a by-prod­uct of our eco­nomic sys­tem and we should fig­ure out a way of how to deal with it.</p>
    <p>Q What else is in your fi­nan­cial plan?</p>
    <p>A When I had my first child, my wife and I did what most par­ents do – we started sav­ing for our chil­dren’s education.</p>
    <p>What we did was pru­dent as the com­pounded re­turns of those sav­ings helped when our chil­dren en­tered ter­tiary education.</p>
    <p>That said, the amount saved and in­vested was not suf­fi­cient. The in­fla­tion of the cost of education went be­yond our ini­tial plan.</p>
    <p>It was a bless­ing then that we took con­trol of our other in­vest­ments and grew them in tan­dem with the ris­ing cost of ter­tiary education.</p>
    <p>Q How are you plan­ning for re­tire­ment?</p>
    <p>A We think that once our chil­dren fin­ish their education, we can start to count down to our of­fi­cial re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>While we plan to re­tire, we do not plan to stop work­ing. Our life ex­pectancy has in­creased sub­stan­tially over the past gen­er­a­tion – to cur­rently 85.7 years for a fe­male and 81.4 years for a male.</p>
    <p>That said, we are work­ing to­wards a re­tire­ment monthly al­lowance of $6,000 to $8,000 – in­clud­ing con­tri­bu­tions from Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund Life – for both my wife and my­self.</p>
    <p>We think this is suf­fi­cient as we are happy with just ba­sic liv­ing.</p>
    <p>We are try­ing to live out the phi­los­o­phy be­hind the wis­dom of English cleric John Wes­ley, who said: “Earn all you can, give all you can, save all you can.”</p>
    <p>Q Money­wise, what were your grow­ing-up years like?</p>
    <p>A I grew up in Toa Payoh where two fam­i­lies squeezed into one three-room flat. My mother was a house­wife, while my fa­ther worked as a clerk in a bank.</p>
    <p>Life was un­com­pli­cated and it al­lowed me to ap­pre­ci­ate good re­la­tion­ships and the sim­plic­ity of life.</p>
    <p>Th­ese ex­pe­ri­ences and a guid­ing Christian faith shaped my early years. They helped me not to view money as the be-all and end-all of life.</p>
    <p>By not be­ing fix­ated on prof­its and losses in in­vest­ments, it prob­a­bly helped me to avoid suc­cumb­ing to sub-op­ti­mal emo­tional de­ci­sions in stress­ful mo­ments dur­ing stock mar­ket crashes.</p>
    <p>Q Home is now...</p>
    <p>A A landed prop­erty in Bukit Timah.</p>
    <p>Q I drive...</p>
    <p>A I take the MRT to work.</p>
