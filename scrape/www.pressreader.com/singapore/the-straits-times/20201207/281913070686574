    <p>The Straits Times’ China cor­re­spon­dent Dan­son Cheong tells the story about China’s war against poverty from his per­spec­tive (China’s frag­ile vic­tory over poverty, Nov 28).</p>
    <p>While it helped read­ers know more about China’s poverty erad­i­ca­tion, some points need to be made clear.</p>
    <p>Mr Cheong said Bei­jing’s poverty line is about 12 per cent lower than the World Bank’s in­ter­na­tional stan­dard of US$1.90 (S$2.53) a day. In­come is not the sin­gle in­di­ca­tor for China’s poverty al­le­vi­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Whether poor peo­ple are free from worries over food and cloth­ing and have ac­cess to com­pul­sory ed­u­ca­tion, ba­sic med­i­cal ser­vices and safe hous­ing are also con­sid­ered.</p>
    <p>In 2015, an ex­pert from the World Bank said that in pur­chas­ing power par­ity-ad­justed terms, China’s na­tional poverty line of 2,300 yuan (S$469) was higher than the World Bank’s US$1.90 a day line.</p>
    <p>Over the past five years, China has made more progress in poverty erad­i­ca­tion. Hence, judg­ing</p>
    <p>China’s poverty line solely by the stan­dard of US$1.90 a day is not ob­jec­tive.</p>
    <p>Mr Cheong also ex­pressed con­cern for the sus­tain­abil­ity of China’s poverty erad­i­ca­tion ef­forts. Af­ter needy peo­ple have shaken off poverty, the Com­mu­nist Party of China (CPC) takes multi-pronged mea­sures to con­sol­i­date the hard-won achieve­ments and pre­vent them from fall­ing back into poverty.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping said on Thurs­day that China has ac­com­plished its poverty al­le­vi­a­tion tar­get as sched­uled and nearly 100 mil­lion peo­ple have been lifted out of poverty since 2012, while more work needs to be done to con­sol­i­date these achieve­ments in the war on poverty. Fight­ing poverty is the long-term un­der­tak­ing and mis­sion state­ment of the CPC.</p>
    <p>In ref­er­ence to the mu­ral, “For a happy life, thank the Party”, I would like to say that the CPC’s aim in poverty erad­i­ca­tion is to give the peo­ple a bet­ter life rather than seek grat­i­tude from the peo­ple.</p>
    <p>How­ever, given the enor­mous changes in Chi­nese peo­ple’s lives not only in the last 10 years but also in the past sev­eral decades, it is nat­u­ral for peo­ple to ex­press their grat­i­tude to the party. Na­tional con­di­tions in China and Sin­ga­pore are dif­fer­ent, but I of­ten hear Sin­ga­porean friends thank found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew as well as the Sin­ga­porean Gov­ern­ment for bring­ing them a happy life to­day.</p>
    <p>To seek hap­pi­ness for the Chi­nese peo­ple is the party’s orig­i­nal aspi­ra­tion. Such grat­i­tude in­spires the CPC to work even harder to cre­ate a bet­ter and hap­pier to­mor­row for the Chi­nese peo­ple.</p>
