    <p>With travel off the cards, an­glers here are cast­ing their lines into lo­cal wa­ters more of­ten, raising con­cerns over whether ma­rine crea­tures could be fished out faster than they can re­pro­duce. Work­ing with con­ser­va­tion­ists and ma­rine sci­en­tists, a non-profit group has come up with three guide­lines for fish­er­men.</p>
    <p>With travel off the cards, an­glers here are cast­ing their lines into lo­cal wa­ters more of­ten, raising con­cerns over whether ma­rine crea­tures might be fished out faster than they can re­pro­duce.</p>
    <p>Some mem­bers of the fish­ing com­mu­nity have pro­posed a so­lu­tion. Work­ing with con­ser­va­tion­ists and ma­rine sci­en­tists, the Ma­rine Stew­ards non-profit group has come up with three guide­lines for fish­er­men.</p>
    <p>First, ju­ve­nile fish should be re­leased, so that they may re­pop­u­late the sea. A list of ma­tu­rity lengths for species com­monly found in Singapore wa­ters, such as the or­angespot­ted grouper, is pro­vided on the group’s web­site.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, the crit­i­cally en­dan­gered shov­el­nose ray – com­monly served as “shark head” in restau­rants – should not be taken at all.</p>
    <p>Third, an­glers should keep hy­brid groupers that are caught, Ma­rine Stew­ards rec­om­mends, as these are non-na­tive species that could out­com­pete na­tive fish for food, dis­rupt­ing the lo­cal ecosys­tem.</p>
    <p>“For fish­er­men, sus­tain­able fish­ing will al­low the sport to flour­ish and even im­prove in gen­er­a­tions to come,” said Ms Sue Ye, founder of Ma­rine Stew­ards.</p>
    <p>Ms Ye her­self is from the fish­ing com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Her com­pany, Singapore Fish­ing Char­ter, has seen a 30 per cent in­crease in monthly book­ings for fish­ing char­ters since mid-June, when Singapore re­opened its econ­omy af­ter a two-month cir­cuit breaker pe­riod to stem the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Recre­ational travel is still not per­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>“With the in­creased fish­ing pres­sure, the com­pany is com­mit­ted to en­sur­ing sus­tain­able fish­ing prac­tices on board,” said Ms Ye.</p>
    <p>Mr Con­rad Lee, 47, a teacher who fishes for recre­ation, said that get­ting peo­ple to re­lease ju­ve­nile fish with the right tech­nique would be a good first step in in­cul­cat­ing sus­tain­able fish­ing guide­lines in the com­mu­nity. “But we should not im­pose our will over oth­ers who might need fish for food,” he added.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Univer­sity of Singapore fish sci­en­tist Zee­han Jaa­far, who worked with Ma­rine Stew­ards on the guide­lines, said the ef­fort was a good first pass at gar­ner­ing stake­holder buy-in in the ab­sence of leg­is­la­tion.</p>
    <p>But a catch-and-re­lease pro­gramme would have to be more com­pre­hen­sive, she said, cit­ing how recre­ational an­glers are al­lowed to take species of any size.</p>
    <p>Last month, for in­stance, an 80kg hon­ey­comb whipray – a species vul­ner­a­ble to ex­tinc­tion – was caught off Be­dok Jetty.</p>
    <p>Dr Jaa­far said there was also con­ser­va­tion value in re­leas­ing ma­ture fish. “The high re­pro­duc­tive po­ten­tial of larger in­di­vid­u­als is a ma­jor fac­tor in en­sur­ing healthy fish­ery stock,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mr Stephen Beng, chair of the Friends of Ma­rine Park com­mu­nity, said that be­cause there are no large-scale fish­eries op­er­at­ing in Singapore wa­ters, recre­ational fish­ing could have an im­pact on fish stock here.</p>
    <p>“We need to be aware of the po­ten­tial is­sues caused by mis­man­aged recre­ational fish­ing... It makes more sense there­fore for those who do recre­ational and sport fish­ing to be in­volved in the con­ser­va­tion of our reef and aquatic habi­tats,” said Mr Beng, adding that a bal­ance must be struck be­tween passion for fish­ing and sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>The Friends of Ma­rine Park com­mu­nity, which com­prises stake­hold­ers such as an­glers, boat own­ers, aca­demics and govern­ment agen­cies, is work­ing on outreach and ed­u­ca­tion pro­grammes, es­pe­cially for those new to the ac­tiv­i­ties, be it fish­ing, boat­ing or div­ing.</p>
    <p>Dr Jef­frey Low, se­nior man­ager at the coastal and ma­rine di­vi­sion at the Na­tional Parks Board’s Na­tional Bio­di­ver­sity Cen­tre, said there are sev­eral “no-take” zones here.</p>
    <p>Fish­ing is not al­lowed in the Sis­ters’ Is­lands Ma­rine Park, Sungei Bu­loh Wet­land Re­serve, Labrador Na­ture Re­serve rocky shore, Chek Jawa Wet­lands, and the wa­ters around Coney Is­land Park.</p>
    <p>“These ar­eas are man­aged as sanc­tu­ar­ies for the man­grove and ma­rine habi­tats to flour­ish and the fish pop­u­la­tion to grow to ma­tu­rity,” said Dr Low.</p>
    <p>The re­cent case of a hon­ey­comb stingray caught at Be­dok Jetty led to many di­vi­sive views in so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Any calls from the lo­cal com­mu­nity for list­ing the hon­ey­comb stingray as a na­tion­ally pro­tected species need to come with sci­en­tific back­ing, such as data on lo­cal pop­u­la­tion and ge­netic stud­ies.</p>
    <p>Also, the pub­lic has to be in­formed. Did the an­gler de­serve the lam­bast­ing and ha­rass­ment he re­ceived?</p>
    <p>Re­cently, fish­ing with hand nets at Changi Beach also ap­pears to have at­tracted crit­i­cism, and the Na­tional Parks Board was alerted to the case.</p>
    <p>Pho­tos were shared on so­cial me­dia sham­ing the act.</p>
    <p>Is Changi Beach now a na­ture re­serve where poach­ing laws ap­ply? What forms of recre­ational fish­ing are le­gal?</p>
    <p>Recre­ational line fish­ing and hand net fish­ing do not push ma­rine species to ex­tinc­tion. The main causes for ex­tinc­tion are habi­tat loss, pol­lu­tion, global warm­ing and com­mer­cial fish­ing, like through the use of trawl nets.</p>
    <p>The re­cent case of the smooth hand­fish go­ing ex­tinct in</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia had noth­ing to do with recre­ational col­lec­tion but likely habi­tat loss and de­struc­tive fish­ing prac­tices such as trawl­ing.</p>
    <p>Wildlife laws need to be based on science, and not emo­tive ide­olo­gies that every sin­gle an­i­mal must be pro­tected.</p>
    <p>Wildlife laws crafted on the ba­sis of emo­tion and an­i­mal rights have al­ways back­fired.</p>
    <p>Just look at how the tro­phy hunt­ing ban has re­versed con­ser­va­tion break­throughs of tro­phy hunt­ing in Africa.</p>
    <p>The an­i­mal rights ide­ol­ogy has al­ways been detri­men­tal to con­ser­va­tion, as con­ser­va­tion views sav­ing species as a whole and not fo­cus­ing on sav­ing in­di­vid­ual an­i­mals.</p>
