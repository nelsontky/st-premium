    <p>• South-east Asia is on the brink of a “so­cio-eco­nomic cri­sis” caused by the Covid-19 pan­demic that could re­verse decades of poverty re­duc­tion, the United Na­tions has warned.</p>
    <p>“The cri­sis threat­ens to de­stroy the liveli­hoods of South-east Asia’s 218 mil­lion in­for­mal work­ers,” a UN pol­icy brief re­leased on Thurs­day said.</p>
    <p>“With­out al­ter­na­tive in­come, for­mal so­cial pro­tec­tion sys­tems or sav­ings to buf­fer these shocks, work­ers and their fam­i­lies will be pushed into poverty, re­vers­ing decades of poverty re­duc­tion.”</p>
    <p>The re­gion-wide econ­omy was ex­pected to con­tract by 0.4 per cent this year, it said, while re­mit­tances from South-east Asians work­ing abroad were likely to fall by 13 per cent or US$10 bil­lion (S$13.8 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>The pa­per also urged na­tions to fix “fis­cal ter­mites”: bud­get-sap­ping prob­lems like tax eva­sion, trans­fer pric­ing and fos­sil fuel sub­si­dies so they can de­liver large stim­u­lus pack­ages to help vul­ner­a­ble pop­u­la­tions and boost their economies.</p>
    <p>Cur­rent low oil prices pro­vided an ideal op­por­tu­nity to re­verse fos­sil fuel sub­si­dies, it added.</p>
    <p>In In­done­sia, the re­gion’s most pop­u­lous coun­try, fos­sil fuel sub­si­dies this year will ex­ceed its en­tire Covid-19 so­cial as­sis­tance and stim­u­lus mea­sures, the UN re­port said.</p>
    <p>As well as boost­ing so­cial wel­fare pay­ments, South-east Asian na­tions should pri­ori­tise higher health spend­ing, said Ms Ar­mida Sal­siah Alis­jah­bana, head of the UN Eco­nomic and So­cial Com­mis­sion for Asia and the Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>Six of the 11 coun­tries in the re­gion – in­clud­ing its two big­gest na­tions, In­done­sia and the Philip­pines – re­ceived the low­est rating for health spend­ing on the UN’s five-tier hu­man de­vel­op­ment in­dex.</p>
    <p>Three oth­ers were on the sec­ond-low­est tier and the re­main­ing two were on the mid­dle tier.</p>
    <p>The re­port cov­ered the Philip­pines, Viet­nam, Laos, Cam­bo­dia, Thai­land, Brunei, Malaysia, Myan­mar, Sin­ga­pore, In­done­sia and Ti­mor-Leste.</p>
