    <p>KA T H M A N D U / B E I J I N G • China and Nepal de­nied yes­ter­day the ac­cu­sa­tions of Nepali op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers who al­leged that Bei­jing had seized ter­ri­tory along the Hi­malayan bor­der be­tween the two na­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Jee­van Ba­hadur Shahi, a provin­cial law­maker of the op­po­si­tion Nepali Congress party, said Chi­nese troops had crossed the bor­der and built nine con­crete struc­tures about 1km in­side Nepal, at Limi in the district of Humla bor­der­ing Ti­bet.</p>
    <p>Mr Shahi, who rep­re­sents the area, said China did not ob­ject when Nepali vil­lagers built a road in the sparsely pop­u­lated area 10 years ago. “They are now say­ing the small val­ley be­longs to them,” he said.</p>
    <p>The claims were first re­ported yes­ter­day by Lon­don’s Daily Tele­graph news­pa­per, which quoted Mr Shahi and another Nepali politi­cian as say­ing China had an­nexed dozens of hectares from the Hi­malayan na­tion bor­der­ing Ti­bet, be­gin­ning in May.</p>
    <p>“It is not true that China has en­croached our land and had con­structed build­ings there,” said Ms Sewa Lam­sal, a spokesman for Nepal’s For­eign Min­istry, but she did not elab­o­rate.</p>
    <p>In Bei­jing, a For­eign Min­istry spokesman, Mr Wang Wen­bin, dis­missed the re­port of China seiz­ing ter­ri­tory from Nepal as a “com­pletely un­founded ru­mour”.</p>
    <p>The area of the al­leged Chi­nese i ncur­sion is rugged and moun­tain­ous, with t he bor­der some­times poorly marked.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, Nepal’s For­eign Min­istry said that when sim­i­lar claims were aired about the area in 2016, it had found the build­ings to be sited 1km within Chi­nese ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>Nepal has no bound­ary dis­pute with China, but it has one with its other neigh­bour In­dia, it­self locked in a mil­i­tary stand-off with China along their con­tested Hi­malayan bor­der.</p>
