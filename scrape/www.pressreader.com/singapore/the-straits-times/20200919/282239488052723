    <p>Lo­cal shares ended broadly un­changed yes­ter­day amid a mixed per­for­mance across the re­gion as traders tried to get a han­dle on the global eco­nomic out­look .</p>
    <p>There was lit­tle lead from Wall Street overnight, where tech gi­ants Ama­zon, Face­book and Ap­ple took a hit as in­vestors grow in­creas­ingly con­cerned about the re­silience of a re­cov­ery in the United States.</p>
    <p>The bench­mark Straits Times In­dex (STI) closed 3.07 points or 0.12 per cent lower at 2,497.71, with gain­ers and losers evenly split at 202 to 202 on trade of 1.74 bil­lion shares worth $1.89 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The strong­est per­form­ing STI com­po­nent stock by a long way was the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX), which rose 5.12 per cent to $9.03.</p>
    <p>This comes af­ter the bourse op­er­a­tor an­nounced the list­ing of the world’s largest Chi­nese pure gov­ern­ment bond ex­change-traded fund (ETF), open­ing a po­ten­tial av­enue of growth in its ETF busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The ETF will be­gin trad­ing on Mon­day, with around US$676 mil­lion (S$918 mil­lion) in as­sets un­der man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Gold­man Sachs also up­graded its call on the SGX this week to “buy” from “neu­tral”, on the view that its de­riv­a­tives busi­ness will perform bet­ter than the mar­ket ex­pects. Gold­man raised its price tar­get on the stock from $8.55 to $10. The SGX will trade ex for its fi­nal div­i­dend of eight cents a share on Oct 1.</p>
    <p>The STI’s next best per­former was Kep­pel Corp, which rose 1.91 per cent to $4.28. It was closely fol­lowed by Dairy Farm In­ter­na­tional, 1.8 per cent ahead at US$3.97.</p>
    <p>Among the smaller caps, Mer­maid Mar­itime rose 9.8 per cent to 6.7 cents. The com­pany, which has a mar­ket cap of $94.7 mil­lion, said ear­lier this week that a wholly owned unit had ex­er­cised a put op­tion on a 33.76 per cent stake in Asia Off­shore Drilling with Sead­rill.</p>
    <p>The con­sid­er­a­tion for the dis­posal is US$31 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Mer­maid also an­nounced that it is form­ing a joint ven­ture with a unit of Thai­land’s PTT Ex­plo­ration and Pro­duc­tion to de­velop ro­bot­ics and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence tech­nol­ogy to pro­vide sub­sea en­gi­neer­ing ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Else­where, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 0.47 per cent, Shang­hai shares put on 2.07 per cent and Shen­zhen ad­vanced 1.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>It was a sim­i­lar story in Seoul, where for­eign cash in­flows helped lift the Kospi by 0.26 per cent for its fourth straight week of gains.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian shares dipped in late trade, although tech and min­ing heavy­weights and Mac­quarie Group kept losses to a min­i­mal and al­lowed the mar­ket to dodge a fifth con­sec­u­tive weekly de­cline.</p>
