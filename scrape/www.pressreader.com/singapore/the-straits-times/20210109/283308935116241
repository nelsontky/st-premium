    <p>A smart home need not have all its tech­no­log­i­cal wizardry and so­phis­ti­cated gad­getry bla­tantly dis­played.</p>
    <p>The nightspots along</p>
    <p>Mo­hamed Sul­tan Road used to be among home­owner Ed­mund Chan’s favourite hang­outs when he was grow­ing up, so when he and his wife, Elaine Koh, were look­ing for a new home, they de­cided to ex­plore the River Val­ley area. “It has an ‘other world­li­ness’ about it, and I like the restau­rants in the vicin­ity,” he says.</p>
    <p>When they   nally found an apart­ment that they liked, they de­cided to have the in­te­rior gut­ted, in or­der to start from scratch. “The ren­o­va­tion was so ex­ten­sive that only two of the ex­ist­ing walls were left stand­ing,” he re­calls.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple turned to Laank for its de­sign ex­per­tise. The home-grown bou­tique prac­tice is the cre­ative ge­nius be­hind</p>
    <p>Vi­o­let Oon’s culi­nary con­cepts and came highly rec­om­mended by her daugh­ter, Tay Su-Lyn, who is a class­mate of Elaine’s.</p>
    <p>“Laank has done a lot of com­mer­cial projects, which tend to have very high stan­dards, so I had ut­most con  dence in them,” shares Ed­mund.</p>
    <p>Cherin Tan, the cre­ative di­rec­tor and founder of Laank, be­gan by un­der­stand­ing the cou­ple’s aes­thetic pref­er­ences.</p>
    <p>Ed­mund says: “Elaine put to­gether a col­lec­tion of im­ages il­lus­trat­ing the looks that we liked and Cherin made sense of them, piec­ing them to­gether like</p>
    <p>FA R L E F T</p>
    <p>pieces of a jig­saw puz­zle.”</p>
    <p>He adds: “I also played around with</p>
    <p>Sketchup, 3-D mod­el­ling soft­ware, which I felt fa­cil­i­tated the dis­cus­sion with Cherin and helped move things along.”</p>
    <p>Be­ing in the busi­ness of home au­to­ma­tion, it comes as no sur­prise that he wanted to in­te­grate smart tech­nolo­gies into the home. The chal­lenge for Laank was to ad­dress the client’s brief for a home that pos­sesses the com­fort and op­u­lence of a lux­ury ho­tel, and com­bine it with the con­ve­nience and ease of tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>A voice prompt alerts the home­own­ers when there are visi­tors, who are greeted by a traver­tine fea­ture wall as they cross the thresh­old into the en­trance foyer. “Glass pan­els in­te­grated into the wall al­low glimpses of the in­te­rior, while a metal tray forms a ledge for dec­o­ra­tive items or keys,”</p>
    <p>Cherin points out. To the left of the en­trance foyer is a se­ries of con­cealed cab­i­nets, which houses the “nerve cen­tre” that con­trols the smart fea­tures of the home, along with an au­to­mated shoe carousel.</p>
    <p>A cus­tomised black mar­ble din­ing ta­ble paired with din­ing chairs up­hol­stered in a rich, vel­vety green con­vey a sense of lux­ury that is ac­cen­tu­ated by the choice of brass hard­ware, echoed by the pen­dant lights above. In re­sponse to Ed­mund and Elaine’s re­quire­ment for more stor­age, con­cealed cab­i­nets were built into the din­ing room wall.</p>
    <p>The fo­cus of the liv­ing room has been in­ten­tion­ally shifted away from the tele­vi­sion set, with the Eames lounge chair and ot­toman de­lib­er­ately an­gled such that they do not di­rectly face the tele­vi­sion set. The tele­vi­sion set it­self will be con­cealed be­hind art­work com­pris­ing two au­to­mated split pan­els that the cou­ple spe­cially com­mis­sioned and which is cur­rently be­ing pro­duced.</p>
    <p>A study area has been carved out of the orig­i­nal liv­ing area. This is also where Ed­mund can play on his key­board, which has been in­ge­niously in­te­grated with his desk us­ing a mov­able liftup panel. Ed­mund and</p>
    <p>Cherin even ad­dressed minute de­tails, such as in­cor­po­rat­ing the cir­cuitry so that when the panel is lifted, the key­board and am­pli  er are au­to­mat­i­cally turned on with­out the need for sep­a­rate switches.</p>
    <p>Ed­mund went to the ex­tent of mak­ing sure that the ceil­ing speak­ers were set into a re­cess.</p>
    <p>“The speak­ers are round, but</p>
    <p>I did not want to see a cir­cu­lar el­e­ment, so I en­sured the speak­ers were re­cessed into the ceil­ing, and fab­ri­cated square cov­ers that are   ush with the ceil­ing,” he ex­plains.</p>
    <p>For Cherin, the suc­cess of the project lies in be­ing able to “achieve some­thing that has good aes­thet­ics, with good ma­te­ri­als, and with­out</p>
