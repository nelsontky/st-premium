    <p>In­surer NTUC In­come plans to dou­ble its li­censed fi­nan­cial ad­vis­ers in the next few years, as part of a broader ef­fort to trans­form the busi­ness and reach out to younger cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive An­drew Yeo, 49, told The Straits Times this month that many young clients knew about In­come through their par­ents, who buy in­surance for them.</p>
    <p>A key find­ing by In­come is that young peo­ple ap­pre­ci­ate lower bar­ri­ers to get in­surance, and In­come is ad­dress­ing this through a wider ar­ray of mi­cro and sub­scrip­tion­based prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, its mi­cro-pol­icy in­surance Snack lets users ac­cu­mu­late cov­er­age with pre­mi­ums start­ing from 30 cents through daily ac­tiv­i­ties like tak­ing pub­lic trans­port.</p>
    <p>Launched in June, the Snack app has been down­loaded 80,000 times, with a $26.5 mil­lion to­tal sum as­sured as at Dec 8.</p>
    <p>In­come launched a sim­i­lar ver­sion in part­ner­ship with dig­i­tal pay­ments firm Visa this month, called Snackup. It al­lows cus­tomers to get at least $100 of free in­surance cov­er­age when they spend at par­tic­i­pat­ing mer­chants or pay with cer­tain cards.</p>
    <p>In­come is also rolling out Tribe, a flex­i­ble in­surance model that lets users in­crease or re­duce their cov­er­age through monthly sub­scrip­tions, with no lock-in pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, new par­ents will be able to buy a child in­surance pack with a monthly pre­mium of $10, con­sist­ing of $5 in­jury in­surance and $5 ill­ness in­surance.</p>
    <p>Par­ents can raise the ill­ness in­surance pre­mium to $10 when the tod­dler starts school and is more sus­cep­ti­ble to in­fec­tious diseases, or in­crease the in­jury in­surance pre­mium when he en­ters pri­mary school and does more sports.</p>
    <p>Tribe is avail­able only to mem­bers of In­come’s part­ners, but the in­surer might of­fer it di­rectly to con­sumers in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“It’s bet­ter that we get in and dis­rupt our­selves than get dis­rupted by oth­ers,” said Mr Yeo, who took over In­come’s reins in June last year. “Th­ese busi­ness models can ac­tu­ally open up new cus­tomer seg­ments for In­come, es­pe­cially the young.”</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo said that In­come will also dou­ble its li­censed fi­nan­cial ad­vis­ers, from the cur­rent count of 1,200. Some will be fresh grad­u­ates who are likely to con­nect well with younger cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the in­surer will also fo­cus on its ex­ist­ing work­force by reskilling staff whose j obs have been made ob­so­lete by the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo said In­come has iden­ti­fied about 100 roles that will be­come re­dun­dant over time. It has al­ready reskilled some branch cus­tomer ser­vice of­fi­cers into roles such as un­der­writ­ers and mem­bers of “ag­ile squads” – or cross-di­vi­sion teams that pi­lot projects.</p>
    <p>The labour move­ment’s so­cial en­ter­prise, which turned 50 this year, has also dig­i­talised its core busi­ness of life, health and gen­eral in­surance.</p>
    <p>It has made it eas­ier for cus­tomers to ac­cess ser­vices on­line through tools such as a dig­i­tal life in­surance ad­viser and e-sub­mis­sions, claims and ser­vic­ing, said Mr Yeo.</p>
    <p>Other im­me­di­ate pri­or­i­ties in­clude ex­plor­ing more op­por­tu­ni­ties for re­gional tie-ups with ac­cel­er­a­tor pro­grammes and part­ner­ships with re­lated busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Aurobindo Ghosh of Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity’s Lee Kong Chian School of Busi­ness said mi­cro and sub­scrip­tion-based in­surance might gain pop­u­lar­ity in Sin­ga­pore with the ad­vent of dig­i­tal banks, ecom­merce and ride-hail­ing plat­forms that of­fer a wide suite of prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Prof Ghosh added: “Tra­di­tional in­surance providers which can pivot to new prod­uct of­fer­ings while lever­ag­ing their tra­di­tional as­set of trust would be most suc­cess­ful in the mar­ket­place.”</p>
    <p>NEW CUS­TOMER SEG­MENTS</p>
    <p>It’s bet­ter that we get in and dis­rupt our­selves than get dis­rupted by oth­ers. Th­ese busi­ness models can ac­tu­ally open up new cus­tomer seg­ments for In­come, es­pe­cially the young.</p>
