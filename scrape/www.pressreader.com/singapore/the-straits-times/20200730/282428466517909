    <p>Bri­tish Gym­nas­tics launched a strong de­fence of its pro­ce­dures on Tues­day af­ter Amy Tinkler claimed the gov­ern­ing body had taken too long to deal with her com­plaint over bul­ly­ing and abuse.</p>
    <p>She re­tired in Jan­uary, less than four years af­ter be­com­ing Bri­tain’s youngest medal­list at the Rio 2016 Olympics. The 20-year-old said she ex­pe­ri­enced bul­ly­ing and was frus­trated by the fail­ure of Bri­tish Gym­nas­tics to act on her com­plaint.</p>
    <p>“I can con­firm that the com­plaint I sub­mit­ted in De­cem­ber 2019 re­lated to my ex­pe­ri­ence at South Durham Gym­nas­tics Club and against part of the Bri­tish Gym­nas­tics coach­ing team,” Tinkler wrote on so­cial me­dia on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“I’ve also been chasing Bri­tish Gym­nas­tics for a time­line on their in­ves­ti­ga­tion into my com­plaint. I un­der­stand it could still take four months or more to reach a con­clu­sion, mak­ing it nearly 12 months from my orig­i­nal com­plaint.</p>
    <p>“I’m un­happy at the length of time this is tak­ing as it leaves vul­ner­a­ble gym­nasts at risk of abuse from known clubs and coaches. I beg Bri­tish Gym­nas­tics to move swifter and take proac­tive ac­tion about our com­plaints.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, Bri­tish Gym­nas­tics in­sisted it had acted ap­pro­pri­ately. “We have been in reg­u­lar touch with Amy Tinkler and her mother through­out this process. It is wrong to sug­gest oth­er­wise,” a state­ment said.</p>
    <p>“An ini­tial sum­mary of the com­plaint was made in late De­cem­ber 2019. Full ev­i­dence was pro­vided in mid-March 2020. As we have al­ready ad­vised Amy and her fam­ily, the in­ves­ti­ga­tion phase is now com­plete and we have moved to the next stage of pro­ce­dures.</p>
    <p>“To be clear, ev­ery com­plaint is looked at in ac­cor­dance with our pro­ce­dures by our in­tegrity unit to as­sess im­me­di­ate risk to gym­nasts.</p>
    <p>“If the ev­i­dence avail­able at the time of the ini­tial com­plaint sug­gests an im­me­di­ate risk of harm to gym­nasts, we take im­me­di­ate ac­tion to pro­tect gym­nasts.”</p>
    <p>Bri­tish gym­nasts from all ages and lev­els of the sport have gone pub­lic to re­veal in­stances of bul­ly­ing and abuse, prompt­ing an in­de­pen­dent re­view.</p>
    <p>Tinkler ini­tially spoke out af­ter the Downie sis­ters, Becky and El­lie, de­scribed an “en­vi­ron­ment of fear and men­tal abuse” and said they had been “left deep scars which will never be healed”.</p>
    <p>I’m un­happy at the length of time this is tak­ing as it leaves vul­ner­a­ble gym­nasts at risk of abuse from known clubs and coaches. ’’</p>
