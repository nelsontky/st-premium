    <p>Two au­dio pro­duc­tions by Sin­ga­pore the­atremak­ers are part of the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Fes­ti­val Of Arts’ v2.020 pro­gramme. This wraps up the last quar­ter of the year with a smat­ter­ing of on­line events which pick up from this year’s dis­rupted fes­ti­val fare.</p>
    <p>Mul­ti­dis­ci­plinary artist Ir­fan Kas­ban’s art col­lec­tive Com­pound is pre­sent­ing The Si­lence Of A Fall­ing Tree, a three-track jour­ney which in­vites lis­ten­ers to be­come part of a per­for­mance art piece.</p>
    <p>Ac­tor-direc­tor Tan Shou Chen teams up with play­wright Joel Tan on A Bird Calls You To Moscow, a three­ep­isode au­dio drama with mu­sic to be ex­pe­ri­enced on the move.</p>
    <p>Ir­fan says his piece was in­spired partly by a de­sire to es­cape the Zoom trap – “there’s some­thing in­ter­nal that we are not ad­dress­ing, or tap­ping into, with the per­for­mances we watch on a phone or a lap­top” – and partly by his dis­cov­ery of guided med­i­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>He says: “You lis­ten to a track and there’s a set of in­struc­tions af­ter med­i­ta­tion. There was some­thing quite the­atri­cal about that.”</p>
    <p>Venues are cau­tiously inch­ing to­wards re­open­ing – the lat­est ad­vi­sory re­leased by the Gov­ern­ment last week al­lows two groups of 50 peo­ple each to gather in des­ig­nated per­form­ing venues – af­ter more than six months of clo­sure.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, the­atremak­ers look­ing to re­cap­ture the vibe of live per­for­mances have latched on to the “retro” au­dio for­mat.</p>
    <p>These two shows fol­low on the heels of Check­point The­atre’s three au­dio of­fer­ings ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Tan Shou Chen ob­serves: “In the­atre, sound is al­ways the for­got­ten sib­ling. It’s so ob­vi­ous when it’s done badly. Done well, you ac­tu­ally for­get it’s there.”</p>
    <p>Joel Tan re­cently re­turned from a three-year stint in Eng­land, where he re­dis­cov­ered the plea­sures of au­dio drama.</p>
    <p>He says he ap­proached the work by ask­ing: “How do we use this as an op­por­tu­nity to make some­thing dig­i­tal that is not just mono­logues?”</p>
    <p>A Bird Calls You To Moscow was orig­i­nally in­tended as a re­sponse to An­ton Chekhov’s Three Sis­ters, a fes­ti­val high­light by home-grown com­pany Nine Years The­atre.</p>
    <p>But Tan Shou Chen says: “When I started read­ing it, I was won­der­ing: What is my con­nec­tion with Three Sis­ters at this height of the cir­cuit breaker? Why should I be re­spond­ing to this?”</p>
    <p>He took in­spi­ra­tion in­stead from his love of mu­sic and na­ture walks.</p>
    <p>The re­sult­ing work en­cour­ages lis­ten­ers to pick dif­fer­ent lo­ca­tions to lis­ten to each in­stal­ment, rang­ing from a room to a park with old trees to a ride on pub­lic trans­port.</p>
    <p>The Si­lence Of A Fall­ing Tree also sug­gests lo­ca­tions, such as a su­per­mar­ket, and re­lated ex­er­cises such as “imag­ine ev­ery­one in the su­per­mar­ket is an ac­tor”.</p>
    <p>For these the­atremak­ers, the au­dio for­mat of­fers in­ti­macy and a dif­fer­ent, more in­ter­nal way to ac­cess the au­di­ence ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Ir­fan, who com­pares his work to a choose-your-own-ad­ven­ture book, says: “When you watch a show, all your judg­ment comes into play: Why do you think it’s not a good piece? Why do you res­onate with it?</p>
    <p>“It all comes from you. So I just wanted to make that clear. At the end of the day, we are our own per­form­ers and our own au­di­ences.”</p>
    <p>A lis­tener con­sum­ing an au­dio ex­pe­ri­ence alone means the artists do not re­ceive feed­back from their au­di­ence, un­like in a live the­atre ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>But that is an ad­van­tage for Joel Tan, who says: “I’ve al­ways found some­thing selfish and vam­piric about the need to feel the pub­lic re­spond­ing to your work.</p>
    <p>“This for­mat feels to me like the po­ten­tial for in­ti­macy is a lot higher. It is re­ally be­tween the lis­tener and the sound. I don’t re­ally care what you think. I’m just giv­ing you this frame around which you can spend some time by your­self.”</p>
