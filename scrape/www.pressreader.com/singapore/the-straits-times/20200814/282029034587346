    <p>The Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) is step­ping up its sup­port for fin­tech here.</p>
    <p>It will com­mit $250 mil­lion in the sec­ond edi­tion of a scheme to speed up tech­nol­ogy adop­tion and in­no­va­tion-driven growth in the lo­cal fi­nan­cial sec­tor.</p>
    <p>MAS also aims to strengthen sup­port for large-scale in­no­va­tion projects, and build a stronger pipe­line of Sin­ga­porean fin­tech tal­ent.</p>
    <p>The amount will be in­vested over the next three years un­der the en­hanced Fi­nan­cial Sec­tor Tech­nol­ogy and In­no­va­tion Scheme (FSTI 2.0), MAS man­ag­ing direc­tor Ravi Menon an­nounced yesterday.</p>
    <p>The fund­ing has been ramped up from the $225 mil­lion spread over five years that was in­jected un­der the orig­i­nal FSTI scheme, launched in 2015, with a vi­sion of mak­ing Sin­ga­pore a Smart Fi­nan­cial Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Un­der the en­hanced scheme, the MAS will dou­ble the max­i­mum fund­ing amount, from $200,000 to $400,000, un­der the Proof-of-Con­cept Grant, and will in­crease the max­i­mum fund­ing sup­port from 50 per cent to 70 per cent of qual­i­fy­ing pro­ject cost, the au­thor­ity said in a sep­a­rate state­ment.</p>
    <p>A merit-based tiered fund­ing mech­a­nism will be in­tro­duced to re­place the ex­ist­ing flat 50 per cent fund­ing sup­port of qual­i­fy­ing pro­ject cost.</p>
    <p>The level of fund­ing sup­port and quan­tum cap for each ap­pli­cant will vary ac­cord­ing to the to­tal num­ber of favourable votes awarded by an eval­u­a­tion panel.</p>
    <p>Funded by the Fi­nan­cial Sec­tor De­vel­op­ment Fund, the lat­est ini­tia­tive aims to in­vig­o­rate the cul­ture of in­no­va­tion in Sin­ga­pore and deepen the cy­ber-se­cu­rity ca­pa­bil­i­ties in the fi­nan­cial sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Mr Menon said: “We have made good progress to­wards our vi­sion of a Smart Fi­nan­cial Cen­tre. Sin­ga­pore is con­sis­tently ranked among the top three or five fin­tech hubs.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore now hosts 40 in­no­va­tion labs, com­pared with hardly any five years ago. These labs have em­barked on close to 500 projects.</p>
    <p>Mr Menon said the in­no­va­tion labs MAS funded so far cre­ated 180 high-value jobs, of which about 60 per cent are held by Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>“More than that, there is valu­able learn­ing and ca­pa­bil­ity trans­fer, help­ing to build our lo­cal tal­ent pool and pipe­line for fu­ture lead­er­ship roles,” he said.</p>
    <p>Be­yond the labs, the dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion across fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions here has opened up jobs for many more peo­ple across ar­eas such as cloud com­put­ing, data science, blockchain, dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing and cy­ber se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>These jobs ac­count for a good part of the 22,000 net jobs the fi­nan­cial sec­tor cre­ated be­tween 2016 and last year.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, MAS es­ti­mates there are nearly 10,000 peo­ple em­ployed by fin­tech firms, many of which are also clas­si­fied as part of the fi­nan­cial ser­vices sec­tor.</p>
    <p>High­light­ing the ex­po­nen­tial growth of the fin­tech start-up com­mu­nity here, Mr Menon said Sin­ga­pore now has 1,000 fin­tech firms, com­pared with about 50 five years ago.</p>
    <p>Last year, fin­tech firms at­tracted a record $1 bil­lion of in­vest­ment. Even dur­ing the first half of this year, marred by the pan­demic, the sec­tor con­tin­ued to at­tract eq­uity fund­ing and merg­ers and ac­qui­si­tions amount­ing to $650 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The cen­tral bank is also ramp­ing up sup­port. It said it will raise the max­i­mum fund­ing quan­tum for all qual­i­fy­ing ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence projects un­der the Ar­ti­fi­cial In­tel­li­gence and Data An­a­lyt­ics (AIDA) Grant from $1 mil­lion to $1.5 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, all new projects un­der the Fi­nan­cial In­sti­tu­tion-Level Projects, In­dus­try-Wide Projects and AIDA Tracks will now qual­ify for fund­ing sup­port for ca­pa­bil­ity trans­fer-re­lated train­ing costs.</p>
    <p>Such train­ing costs in­clude ex­penses in­curred to en­gage spe­cial­ists to train the lo­cal tal­ent pool, and ex­penses in­curred to send lo­cal em­ploy­ees for over­seas train­ing.</p>
    <p>These train­ing pro­grammes will help to sup­port work­force trans­for­ma­tion in the fi­nan­cial sec­tor and to ac­cel­er­ate skills and knowl­edge trans­fer to Sin­ga­porean tal­ents.</p>
