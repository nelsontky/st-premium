    <p>The labour move­ment’s top lead­er­ship has reaf­firmed its sup­port for labour chief Ng Chee Meng and said he will re­main sec­re­tary-gen­eral of NTUC.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, Na­tional Trades Union Congress pres­i­dent Mary Liew said Mr Ng will re­tain his po­si­tion in the or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>“As an NTUC elected po­si­tion, it is a po­si­tion which stands in­de­pen­dent of po­lit­i­cal ap­point­ments. The mem­bers of the NTUC cen­tral com­mit­tee stand in unan­i­mous sup­port for Brother Ng Chee Meng as sec­re­tary-gen­eral of NTUC,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ques­tions have been raised about Mr Ng’s po­si­tion in the labour move­ment af­ter the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party team he led in Sengkang GRC lost to the Work­ers’ Party in last Fri­day’s elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The NTUC cen­tral com­mit­tee elects among it­self the pres­i­dent, sec­re­tary-gen­eral and other key of­fice-hold­ers, af­ter com­mit­tee mem­bers are elected by union del­e­gates at a con­fer­ence once every four years.</p>
    <p>Ms Liew said it is on the re­quest of the cen­tral com­mit­tee, and mu­tual agree­ment with the Gov­ern­ment, that a min­is­ter is sec­onded to</p>
    <p>NTUC. A Cabi­net min­is­ter has held the sec­re­tary-gen­eral post for the last 40 years.</p>
    <p>She said: “Whilst the two roles have been in­ex­tri­ca­bly linked, they are in fact in­de­pen­dent of each other... As we head into more chal­leng­ing times ahead, we re­main res­o­lute in our mis­sion to help work­ers.</p>
    <p>“Brother Ng Chee Meng has over the last two years pushed for many good ini­tia­tives for work­ers and this is work that must con­tinue.</p>
    <p>“We stand in sol­i­dar­ity as we con­tinue this jour­ney to­gether.”</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, Mr Ng said he will soon be step­ping down from the Cabi­net, but will con­tinue to ful­fil his elected role in NTUC.</p>
    <p>He said: “I will con­tinue to serve work­ers who have given me their trust and I re­main as un­de­terred as the day I first joined the labour move­ment – to be along­side our work­ers and to be their voice.</p>
    <p>“There will be tough days ahead with the Covid-19 chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>“To­gether with union lead­ers and my NTUC col­leagues, we will stay the course to care for and do right by our work­ers.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ng be­came labour chief on May 22, 2018, tak­ing over from Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing.</p>
    <p>Ms Liew, in her state­ment, said</p>
    <p>Mr Ng has played an in­stru­men­tal role in push­ing for­ward ini­tia­tives to help se­cure work­ers’ liveli­hoods.</p>
    <p>He had cham­pi­oned work­ers’ train­ing through the set­ting up of com­pany train­ing com­mit­tees, where union lead­ers and com­pany man­age­ment work to­gether to plan and op­er­a­tionalise train­ing for work­ers.</p>
    <p>He also launched the NTUC Job Se­cu­rity Coun­cil this year, to match re­trenched work­ers and those at risk of los­ing their jobs amid the Covid-19 pan­demic to op­por­tu­ni­ties in other com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>About 12,000 work­ers have been matched to new roles, said Ms Liew. “Time and again, Mr Ng has shown his heart in caring for work­ers and proven his met­tle,” she added.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion pres­i­dent Robert Yap said he looks for­ward to con­tin­u­ing to work with the NTUC led by Mr Ng, and the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>He said: “I am con­fi­dent that the tri­par­tite part­ner­ship in Sin­ga­pore re­mains strong with Brother Ng Chee Meng as the sec­re­tary-gen­eral of NTUC.”</p>
    <p>Mr Yap said he, Mr Ng and Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo had sev­eral dis­cus­sions in June last year while they were in Geneva for the In­ter­na­tional Labour Con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>The three of them were ad­vis­ers to the Tri­par­tite Work­group on Older Work­ers, which last Au­gust rec­om­mended rais­ing the re­tire­ment and re-em­ploy­ment ages by three years over the next decade.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Yap: “We had to dis­cuss even on week­ends as Mr Ng wanted to en­sure more older work­ers could ben­e­fit from any changes.</p>
    <p>“From the em­ploy­ers’ per­spec­tive, there were con­cerns about tim­ing and flex­i­bil­ity. We fi­nally reached tri­par­tite con­sen­sus af­ter a few rounds of ro­bust dis­cus­sions.</p>
