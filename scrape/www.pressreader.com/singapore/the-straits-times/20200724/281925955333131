    <p>On Sun­day, the 100-day count­down to the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in the US be­gins, and all tra­di­tional met­rics point to a Demo­cratic vic­tory. But we have seen that be­fore.</p>
    <p>Since World War II, all in­cum­bents with an ap­proval rat­ing of 50 per cent or higher in June of their re-elec­tion year have gone on to win while those with rat­ings be­low 40 per cent have al­ways lost. Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s lat­est Gallup job ap­proval rat­ing rests at 38 per cent.</p>
    <p>Across all polls, Mr Joe Bi­den now leads Mr Trump by nearly 9 points in a head-to-head match-up. Since 1976, all can­di­dates who had this large a lead in the polls this close to the elec­tion have gone on to win.</p>
    <p>If un­til elec­tion day a sig­nif­i­cant ma­jor­ity of vot­ers con­tinue to dis­ap­prove of Mr Trump’s over­all job per­for­mance, and his han­dling of the coro­n­avirus in par­tic­u­lar, Mr Bi­den will be the 46th pres­i­dent of the United States.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump must now beat both Mr Bi­den and the cal­en­dar. With early vot­ing, some peo­ple are able to start cast­ing their bal­lots less than two months from now.</p>
    <p>Still, a com­bi­na­tion of for­tu­itous tim­ing, des­per­ate mea­sures by Mr Trump pay­ing off, his his­tory of dis­rup­tive rule-shat­ter­ing be­hav­iour along with stum­bles by the Bi­den cam­paign could turn things around.</p>
    <p>TRUMP’S 2016 STRAT­EGY CAN PAY OFF AGAIN</p>
    <p>First, while much less likely this time, Mr Trump’s path to vic­tory from four years ago could hap­pen again. By win­ning just enough votes in Michi­gan, Penn­syl­va­nia and Wis­con­sin by ap­peal­ing to blue-col­lar, non-col­lege-ed­u­cated males, he can squeak out a vic­tory in the Elec­toral Col­lege while again los­ing the pop­u­lar vote, and prob­a­bly by a larger mar­gin this time. Mr Trump’s strate­gists sug­gest that the cam­paign has iden­ti­fied sig­nif­i­cant num­bers of dis­af­fected or in­ac­tive vot­ers in those key ju­ris­dic­tions and else­where around the coun­try.</p>
    <p>But it will be much tougher for Mr Trump to suc­ceed run­ning as the in­cum­bent given this year’s dire health and eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion. Also, the Democrats claim they will not be caught nap­ping.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s at­tacks against “Sleepy Joe” have proven less im­pact­ful than those against the much more po­lar­is­ing “Crooked Hil­lary”. And now he must run less on his self-ag­gran­dised claims of busi­ness suc­cess and tagged with quan­tifi­able ev­i­dence of his short­com­ings as ex­ec­u­tive.</p>
    <p>Still, since be­com­ing pres­i­dent, Mr Trump has searched for more vot­ers of the same de­mo­graphic to add to his 2016 vote to­tals. His cam­paign and the Repub­li­can Na­tional Com­mit­tee have hired over 1,500 staff in the key states and na­tion­ally have trained 1.4 mil­lion vol­un­teers and con­tacted more than 55 mil­lion vot­ers.</p>
    <p>The in­cum­bent’s ad­van­tage of hav­ing nearly four years to find, tar­get and in­flu­ence vot­ers can re­sult in a re­peat of 2016 – even with a larger loss na­tion­ally this time around.</p>
    <p>A VAC­CINE COULD SAVE THE DAY</p>
    <p>A vac­cine for the coro­n­avirus lead­ing to a V-shaped eco­nomic re­cov­ery be­tween now and elec­tion day could keep Mr Trump in the White House.</p>
    <p>“Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed”, the US gov­ern­ment pro­gramme cre­ated to fa­cil­i­tate and ac­cel­er­ate the de­vel­op­ment, man­u­fac­ture and dis­tri­bu­tion of Covid-19 vac­cines, could suc­ceed.</p>
    <p>And when the vac­cine ar­rives, expect eco­nomic in­di­ca­tors to sky­rocket. The stock mar­ket al­ready goes up on the slight­est hint of good news. There will be a cor­re­spond­ing rise in Mr Trump’s ap­proval rat­ing, one that might even be enough to cat­a­pult him back to the Oval Of­fice.</p>
    <p>But the odds of these two Vs com­ing through in time to save Mr Trump ap­pear slim.</p>
    <p>While the Trump team yearns for a vac­cine by Oc­to­ber, hope alone is not a strat­egy. They will en­gage in other tac­tics to try to win.</p>
    <p>A SUPREME COURT SUR­PRISE</p>
    <p>Nam­ing con­ser­va­tive ju­rists to the fed­eral ju­di­ciary re­mains a pri­mary pil­lar of Mr Trump’s ap­peal to his base of anti-im­mi­gra­tion, anti-abor­tion and pro-gun vot­ers.</p>
    <p>A Supreme Court va­cancy so close to the elec­tion will re­mind those vot­ers what’s at stake in the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion from a ju­di­cial per­spec­tive and could both drive out his base and keep those swing Repub­li­cans who care strongly about these is­sues from con­sid­er­ing vot­ing for Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>Re­tire­ment ru­mours abound qui­etly over whether con­ser­va­tive jus­tices Clarence Thomas (aged 72) or Sa­muel Al­ito (aged 70) could be en­cour­aged to re­tire, giv­ing Mr Trump the chance to nom­i­nate a younger (and most likely fe­male) re­place­ment. Re­cent health is­sues in­volv­ing Chief Jus­tice John Roberts and Jus­tice Ruth Bader Gins­burg add to the spec­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>As a re­minder, Jus­tice An­tonin Scalia died in Fe­bru­ary 2016 and then-and-cur­rent Sen­ate Ma­jor­ity Leader Mitch McCon­nell blocked any ac­tion to con­firm Pres­i­dent Barack Obama’s nom­i­nee, given the close­ness to elec­tion day. Expect no such moral and prin­ci­pled con­sis­tency from the Repub­li­can-con­trolled Sen­ate this time. Mr McCon­nell sees a last­ing con­ser­va­tive Supreme Court as his legacy, and he will em­ploy all his pow­ers to jam through one last con­fir­ma­tion no mat­ter how late the date.</p>
    <p>Also, Mr Trump could is­sue ex­ec­u­tive orders aimed at lim­it­ing de­fec­tions from those who are on the fence but lean­ing to­wards Mr Bi­den. For ex­am­ple, he could of­fer some pro­tec­tions for im­mi­grants who en­tered the US il­le­gally as chil­dren, thereby keep­ing just enough mod­er­ate Repub­li­cans and in­de­pen­dents on his side.</p>
    <p>BI­DEN NEEDS TO AVOID SELF-IN­FLICTED WOUNDS</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has com­mit­ted mul­ti­ple and se­ri­ous er­rors in terms of govern­ing and cam­paign­ing, al­low­ing Mr Bi­den to gain mo­men­tum’s favour with­out hav­ing to do much of any­thing.</p>
    <p>But Mr Bi­den could trip him­self up. First, his pick for vice-pres­i­dent could work against him ei­ther with his base, who may not be sat­is­fied if he goes with a more mod­er­ate choice, or in­de­pen­dent and vot­ers be­ing turned off if he picks a pro­gres­sive as his run­ning mate. It is a tightrope and ei­ther sce­nario play­ing out could keep po­ten­tial vot­ers for Mr Bi­den home.</p>
    <p>While the Demo­cratic Party unites in its op­po­si­tion to Mr Trump, a mis­step in the vice-pres­i­dent roll-out could Balka­nise the party and re­duce voter turnout.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, the can­di­date him­self could com­mit a se­ri­ous er­ror. Dur­ing the 1976 pres­i­den­tial de­bates, Mr Ger­ald Ford said: “There is no Soviet dom­i­na­tion of East­ern Europe and there never will be un­der a Ford ad­min­is­tra­tion.” De­bat­able whether this alone cost Mr Ford the elec­tion, but in no way did it help.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den and his cam­paign are dis­ci­plined but the rigours of a gru­elling con­test in the clos­ing months can make one more prone to mis­takes. A gaffe in Oc­to­ber by Mr Bi­den, who would be the old­est per­son ever elected pres­i­dent, could mat­ter in a very close elec­tion by giv­ing vot­ers pause on his ca­pac­ity to lead.</p>
    <p>In this vein, Demo­cratic strate­gist Peter Goelz op­poses Mr Bi­den’s agree­ing to three de­bates, which gives Mr Trump mul­ti­ple chances to force a Bi­den mis­cue. “He should only agree to the de­bates if Trump agrees to re­lease his tax re­turns, as Bi­den has done,” Mr Goelz ar­gues.</p>
    <p>THE LAT­EST NUM­BERS</p>
    <p>In 2016, pre­dic­tions of a Clin­ton vic­tory were the norm from po­lit­i­cal ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Again, the ex­perts are pre­dict­ing a Trump de­feat.</p>
    <p>Mr Kyle Kondik of the Univer­sity of Vir­ginia Cen­tre for Pol­i­tics finds “Trump is ex­tremely un­likely to win if the polls con­tinue to look the way they do now”.</p>
    <p>The non-par­ti­san Cook Re­port gives Mr Bi­den 279 elec­toral votes in the solid, likely or lean­ing cat­e­gories, which would give him the pres­i­dency. (The Elec­toral Col­lege con­sists of 538 elec­tors, and an ab­so­lute ma­jor­ity of at least 270 votes is needed for vic­tory).</p>
    <p>The Econ­o­mist pres­i­den­tial elec­tion fore­cast, which com­bines state and na­tional polls with eco­nomic data, gives Mr Bi­den a 93 per cent chance of win­ning.</p>
    <p>These mod­els and fore­casts might not be tak­ing into ac­count the chal­lenges to over­come amid vot­ing in the pan­demic era, which could lead to fewer votes for Mr Bi­den. What hap­pens if peo­ple who would have voted for Mr Bi­den in nor­mal cir­cum­stances can­not?</p>
    <p>The can­di­date wor­ries about ac­cess to vot­ing. “Frankly this is the thing that keeps me up most at night,” Mr Bi­den has said. “Mak­ing sure ev­ery­one who wants to vote can vote. Mak­ing sure that the vote is counted, mak­ing sure we’re all trust­ing in the in­tegrity of the re­sults of the elec­tion.”</p>
    <p>If from now till Nov 3 we wit­ness the dis­cov­ery of a vac­cine and cor­re­spond­ing V-shape eco­nomic re­cov­ery, a Supreme Court sur­prise, stum­bles from Mr Bi­den – all while Mr Trump turns out his vot­ers cou­pled with Mr Bi­den’s in­abil­ity to do the same, the ex­perts could very well be wrong again.</p>
