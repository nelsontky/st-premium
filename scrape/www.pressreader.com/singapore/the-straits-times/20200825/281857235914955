    <p>TOKYO • Ja­pan’s Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe yes­ter­day said he wants to take care of his health and do his ut­most at his job, af­ter a sec­ond hospi­tal visit within days sparked con­cern over whether he could stay on as leader of the world’s third-big­gest econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The visit came as Ja­pan’s longest­serv­ing prime min­is­ter sur­passed the record for long­est con­sec­u­tive ten­ure as premier – 2,798 days – set by his great-un­cle Eisaku Sato half a cen­tury ago, adding to spec­u­la­tion Mr Abe could re­sign af­ter reach­ing the mile­stone.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe hit 2,799 days yes­ter­day. Crit­i­cised for his han­dling of the coro­n­avirus out­break and some scan­dals, Mr Abe, 66, has suf­fered a slide in voter sup­port to one of the low­est lev­els since re­turn­ing to of­fice for a sec­ond term in 2012.</p>
    <p>“I’d like to take care of my health and do my best at my job,” Mr Abe told re­porters at his of­fi­cial res­i­dence, af­ter vis­it­ing a Tokyo hospi­tal where he said he had re­ceived re­sults of an exam done last week and un­der­gone ad­di­tional ex­am­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>It was the same hospi­tal where he was treated af­ter his res­ig­na­tion from his pre­vi­ous stint as prime min­is­ter in 2007 for ul­cer­a­tive col­i­tis, a dis­ease he now keeps in check with medicine that was not pre­vi­ously avail­able.</p>
    <p>Ja­panese me­dia has spec­u­lated about Mr Abe’s health this month, in­clud­ing de­tailed re­ports on his walk­ing speed.</p>
    <p>When asked whether Mr Abe would serve out his full term through Septem­ber next year, govern­ment spokesman Yoshi­hide Suga said: “The ad­di­tional tests are be­ing done to achieve that end.”</p>
    <p>If Mr Abe is in­ca­pac­i­tated, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Taro Aso, 79, who dou­bles as fi­nance min­is­ter, would take over tem­po­rar­ily as act­ing prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Those tipped as pos­si­ble suc­ces­sors in­clude Mr Aso, for­mer de­fence min­is­ter Shigeru Ishiba, for­mer for­eign min­is­ter Fu­mio Kishida, Mr Suga, and De­fence Min­is­ter Taro Kono.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts have noted that th­ese vet­er­ans are un­likely to make huge pol­icy shifts.</p>
    <p>But any suc­ces­sor may find it tough to em­u­late Mr Abe’s po­lit­i­cal longevity, which fol­lowed years of re­volv­ing-door pre­miers and was aided by the strong econ­omy, tight con­trol over bu­reau­crats and weak op­po­si­tion par­ties.</p>
