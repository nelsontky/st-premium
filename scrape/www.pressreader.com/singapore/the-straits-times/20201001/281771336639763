    <p>Firms and in­di­vid­u­als can get more help in ob­tain­ing relief dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic as re­lated leg­is­la­tion came into force yes­ter­day, the Min­istry of Law (MinLaw) said.</p>
    <p>Th­ese amend­ments to the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act and re­lated laws strengthen the le­gal mech­a­nisms avail­able to sup­port busi­nesses and peo­ple in deal­ing with the im­pact of the pan­demic, it added.</p>
    <p>The changes in­clude giv­ing ex­panded pow­ers to rental relief assessors and pro­vid­ing a way for those af­fected by con­struc­tion­re­lated de­lays to get help.</p>
    <p>Un­der the new rules, rental relief assessors can now make de­ci­sions on dis­putes that re­late to the amount of rent to be waived, un­der the rental relief frame­work.</p>
    <p>This ap­plies to cases where the amount of waiver is af­fected by is­sues such as main­te­nance and ser­vice charges, es­pe­cially where such charges are not ex­plic­itly listed in lease or li­cence agree­ments.</p>
    <p>It also ap­plies to sce­nar­ios where the amount can be off­set by ear­lier as­sis­tance pro­vided by the land­lord, where the ten­ant oc­cu­pies the prop­erty for only a part of the relief pe­riod and where there is sub-di­vi­sion of prop­erty, which means there are mul­ti­ple sub-ten­ants and not all of them may be el­i­gi­ble for waivers.</p>
    <p>But rental relief assessors will not re­view ex­ist­ing ar­range­ments that have al­ready been agreed upon by land­lords and ten­ants, re­gard­ing the im­ple­men­ta­tion of rental waivers.</p>
    <p>Those who have dis­putes re­lat­ing to the amount of rent waiver can sub­mit ap­pli­ca­tions for a rental relief asses­sor to re­view.</p>
    <p>They have to sub­mit the ap­pli­ca­tion by Oct 14, if they re­ceived no­tice of a cash grant by the In­land Rev­enue Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore on or be­fore Sept 30. Those who re­ceive it af­ter Sept 30 can sub­mit ap­pli­ca­tions within 10 work­ing days of re­ceiv­ing the no­tice.</p>
    <p>Be­sides those with dis­putes, the new changes also pro­vide a mech­a­nism for those af­fected by con­struc­tion-re­lated de­lays to get help.</p>
    <p>This mech­a­nism aims to pro­vide relief for those who rent goods used for con­struc­tion work who are now li­able for ad­di­tional ex­penses due to a de­lay or breach in a re­lated con­tract.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, a con­trac­tor may have rented goods such as scaf­fold­ing ma­te­rial or hand drills from a sup­plier to per­form works un­der a con­struc­tion con­tract with a third party.</p>
    <p>But the works may have been de­layed due to the pan­demic, in­cur­ring ad­di­tional rental ex­penses. The con­trac­tor can then ap­ply for relief, said MinLaw.</p>
    <p>The sup­port also ap­plies to ten­ants of non-res­i­den­tial prop­er­ties who can­not carry out or fin­ish ren­o­va­tion or fit­ting-out works dur­ing their rent-free pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Ten­ants are typ­i­cally granted a rent-free win­dow to fin­ish such works, but they might have lost out on this win­dow if con­trac­tors could not com­plete ren­o­va­tion due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The ten­ant may ap­ply for relief for the part of the rent-free pe­riod that was not used, MinLaw added.</p>
    <p>Lastly, the new mech­a­nism also ap­plies to land­lords of non-res­i­den­tial prop­er­ties who are un­able to de­liver pos­ses­sion to the ten­ant by a stip­u­lated date be­cause of coro­n­avirus-re­lated de­lays in con­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>To be el­i­gi­ble for relief, ap­pli­cants must also check that their af­fected con­tracts had been in force any time be­tween Feb 1 this year and March 31 next year.</p>
    <p>The con­tract must also be en­tered into be­fore March 25, and any de­lay or breach must have oc­curred be­tween Feb 1 this year and March 31 next year.</p>
    <p>They must sub­mit ap­pli­ca­tions for relief by May 31 next year.</p>
    <p>MinLaw added that an asses­sor ap­pointed by the min­istry may ad­just the con­trac­tual terms to mit­i­gate the im­pact of the de­lay, in those spe­cific cir­cum­stances.</p>
