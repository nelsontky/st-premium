    <p>French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron is rightly proud of lead­ing the in­ter­na­tional ef­fort to pro­vide aid to Le­banon in the wake of the cat­a­strophic explosion in its cap­i­tal Beirut, which killed more than 150 peo­ple, left 6,000 wounded and flat­tened a large part of the Lebanese cap­i­tal, in­clud­ing its crit­i­cal sea­port in­fras­truc­ture.</p>
    <p>Mr Macron, whose coun­try was Le­banon’s old colo­nial mas­ter, was the first world leader to fly into the dis­as­ter zone. And it was thanks to his ef­forts that around €253 mil­lion (S$408 mil­lion) had been pledged for re­con­struc­tion ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Yet, as Mr Macron was quick to point out, this hu­man­i­tar­ian aid is not a long-term so­lu­tion. “It is up to the coun­try’s au­thor­i­ties to act and im­ple­ment re­forms, so that the coun­try does not sink,” he noted.</p>
    <p>But that will not be easy since Le­banon ba­si­cally needs to be rein­vented if it is to re­gain its foot­ing. The prob­lem is not only that the coun­try is re­li­giously di­vided – with about half of the pop­u­la­tion Mus­lim and around 41 per cent Chris­tian – but also that there are di­vi­sions within each com­mu­nity, and that po­lit­i­cal par­ties – all based on eth­nic and re­li­gious af­fil­i­a­tions – op­er­ate as states within a state, com­plete with their own eco­nomic in­ter­ests and para­mil­i­tary struc­tures.</p>
    <p>Le­banon’s con­sti­tu­tional ar­range­ment, which re­quires the pres­i­dent to be a Chris­tian, the prime min­is­ter to be a Sunni Mus­lim, the Speaker of Par­lia­ment to be a Shi’ite and the deputy prime min­is­ter to be a Greek Ortho­dox is de­signed to re­as­sure ev­ery com­mu­nity. But it has, in­stead, the para­dox­i­cal ef­fect of en­trench­ing di­vi­sions and en­cour­ag­ing vast cor­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the eco­nomic re­forms which Le­banon needs sim­ply have no chance of be­ing im­ple­mented since they in­vari­ably ben­e­fit one com­mu­nity at the ex­pense of an­other.</p>
    <p>There­fore, the sums raised for hu­man­i­tar­ian re­lief will be dis­bursed through the United Na­tions and in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions, rather than the Lebanese gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>And that is also why Mr Macron has con­di­tioned the re­lief to de­mands for an “im­par­tial, cred­i­ble and in­de­pen­dent in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the causes of the dis­as­ter”, a ref­er­ence to all the past dys­func­tional Lebanese gov­ern­ments that al­lowed huge quan­ti­ties of ex­plo­sive chem­i­cals to be stored for years in the heart of their cap­i­tal – and ef­fec­tively caused the dis­as­ter at the port.</p>
    <p>In the­ory, the op­por­tu­ni­ties for rad­i­cal change have never been bet­ter. The out­rage about what has hap­pened has united the na­tion, re­gard­less of re­li­gious di­vi­sions. And the be­lief that the en­tire po­lit­i­cal class must be re­moved is strong; Lebanese have demon­strated with mock ex­e­cu­tioner’s nooses, a sym­bol of their de­mand for the dis­ap­pear­ance of all their cor­rupt politi­cians.</p>
    <p>And top lead­ers are get­ting the mes­sage. Cor­rup­tion in Le­banon is “big­ger than the state” it­self, and “a very thick and thorny wall sep­a­rates us from change; a wall for­ti­fied by a class that is re­sort­ing to all dirty meth­ods in or­der to re­sist and pre­serve its gains”, Prime Min­is­ter Has­san Diab said in an­nounc­ing his gov­ern­ment’s im­me­di­ate res­ig­na­tion.</p>
    <p>The snag is that there is one force in Le­banon stronger than all the oth­ers and un­will­ing to give up its edge: Hizbol­lah, the Shi’ite mili­tia spon­sored by Iran.</p>
    <p>Hizbol­lah’s Ira­nian-sup­plied ar­se­nals are big­ger than those of many national armies of other coun­tries in the Mid­dle East. And its ten­ta­cles run ev­ery­where, from the con­trol of all of Le­banon’s sea­ports to in­fil­tra­tions into neigh­bour­ing Is­rael, which em­broiled Le­banon in a war with Is­rael more than a decade ago.</p>
    <p>Mired in the civil war in Syria where it is sup­port­ing the pro-Ira­nian fac­tion, Hizbol­lah has no in­ter­est in drag­ging Le­banon into an­other war with Is­rael. But it equally has no in­ten­tion of giv­ing up its po­lit­i­cal con­trol in­side Le­banon.</p>
    <p>Hizbol­lah chief Has­san Nas­ral­lah de­nies any re­spon­si­bil­ity for the Beirut explosion, claim­ing that his or­gan­i­sa­tion is merely in­ter­ested in op­pos­ing Is­rael; “we know more about the port of Haifa than the port of Beirut”, Nas­ral­lah said, re­fer­ring to Is­rael’s main har­bour.</p>
    <p>But few in Le­banon or out­side be­lieve him, and Hizbol­lah is widely viewed as the big­gest sin­gle ob­sta­cle to Lebanese unity. And as he walked through a Chris­tian district of Beirut dur­ing his visit. Mr Macron heard re­peated shouts of “free us from Hizbol­lah”.</p>
    <p>For the mo­ment, France – which con­tin­ues to take the lead in Le­banon – is care­ful to keep Hizbol­lah en­gaged, fear­ing that oth­er­wise the Beirut explosion may lead to an even big­ger tragedy, such as a re­sump­tion of the sec­tar­ian war which tore Le­banon apart dur­ing the 1970s.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem for all those who wish Le­banon well is that if iso­lat­ing Hizbol­lah is a dan­ger­ous propo­si­tion, in­clud­ing Hizbol­lah in any new gov­ern­ment struc­ture would only repeat past er­rors.</p>
