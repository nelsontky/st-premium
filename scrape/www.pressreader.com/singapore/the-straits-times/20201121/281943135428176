    <p>A sense of quiet con­fi­dence per­vades New Delhi, that ties with Wash­ing­ton will re­tain the heft ac­quired un­der United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, but un­cer­tainty lurks over whether the Bi­den pres­i­dency will raise some un­com­fort­able ques­tions.</p>
    <p>Against the back­drop of per­cep­tion that Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi was far too cosy with Mr Trump, In­dia has this week been re­call­ing Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s long-time sup­port for closer ties with Delhi.</p>
    <p>In a phone call with Mr Bi­den on Tues­day, Mr Modi “warmly re­called” his ear­lier in­ter­ac­tions with the Pres­i­dent-elect dur­ing his vis­its to the US in 2014 and 2016.</p>
    <p>Ex­ter­nal Af­fairs Min­is­ter S. Jais­hankar has un­der­lined that Mr Bi­den is no stranger to In­dia.</p>
    <p>He said: “As vice-pres­i­dent, we dealt with him. I hap­pened to be the am­bas­sador dur­ing the last phase of the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion. We knew him when he was in the Se­nate For­eign Re­la­tions Com­mit­tee as the rank­ing Demo­cratic mem­ber, and then as the chair­man.”</p>
    <p>Still, Delhi won­ders whether the Bi­den pres­i­dency will have some­thing to say about In­dia’s do­mes­tic is­sues, rang­ing from the Cit­i­zen­ship Amend­ment Act – a law crit­ics say goes against the sec­u­lar tra­di­tions of the coun­try as it grants re­li­gion-based cit­i­zen­ship – to al­leged hu­man rights abuses in Kash­mir.</p>
    <p>In­dia has tra­di­tion­ally protested against any com­ments on its in­ter­nal poli­cies, but this is a big­ger is­sue for Mr Modi, whose pol­i­tics re­volve around na­tion­al­ism and the idea of a strong In­dia.</p>
    <p>The Prime Min­is­ter may prove adept at cul­ti­vat­ing Mr Bi­den, said Pro­fes­sor Harsh Pant, di­rec­tor of stud­ies and head of the Strate­gic Stud­ies Pro­gramme at the Ob­server Re­search Foun­da­tion in New Delhi.</p>
    <p>“Mr Modi has been nim­ble in his out­reach to both (Barack) Obama and Trump. He dealt with them very dif­fer­ently. With Trump, the ap­proach Modi de­cided to take was to de­velop a per­sonal re­la­tion­ship, mas­sage his ego, which I think paid div­i­dends for In­dia. With Bi­den, the idea is to go back to the ba­sics of the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion and to use that as a launch­ing point.”</p>
    <p>In­dia has po­si­tioned it­self strate­gi­cally closer to the US amid its worst bor­der clashes in over four decades with China, which saw Delhi throw off hes­i­ta­tion in invit­ing Aus­tralia to join the Mal­abar naval ex­er­cises in­volv­ing Ja­pan and the US.</p>
    <p>The group­ing is viewed as ad­ver­sar­ial by Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>The grow­ing pres­ence of China in the In­dian Ocean is a worry as well, and will likely re­main a point of con­ver­gence for In­dia and the US.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Shankari Sun­darara­man at Jawa­har­lal Nehru Univer­sity said that she did not en­vis­age a ma­jor shift. “The pivot to Asia and re­bal­anc­ing came un­der Obama, and the free and open Indo-Pa­cific vi­sion un­der Trump. I don’t see</p>
    <p>Bi­den chang­ing the US ap­proach to main­tain­ing the nor­ma­tive or­der.”</p>
    <p>Still, some ex­pect ini­tial tur­bu­lence. Re­tired naval com­modore C. Uday Bhaskar, di­rec­tor of the in­de­pen­dent think-tank So­ci­ety for Pol­icy Stud­ies, said: “There is cer­tain bag­gage from the Trump pe­riod. In­dia had in a way aligned it­self with the Trump pres­i­dency in a more vis­i­ble man­ner than is the norm.”</p>
    <p>He added: “There will be some tur­bu­lence in the early stages, but con­ti­nu­ity will re­main.”</p>
