    <p>We have the same hunger for ti­tles in the na­tional team as at Bay­ern. There is no dif­fer­ence there.</p>
    <p>NIK­LAS SUELE, Bay­ern Mu­nich and Ger­many de­fender, on his team­mates’ ap­proach to in­ter­na­tional com­pe­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>BER­LIN • Bay­ern Mu­nich’s tre­blewin­ning sea­son should feed the hunger for ti­tles in the na­tional team as Ger­many pre­pare to host Spain i n their Na­tions League opener to­day, Nik­las Suele said.</p>
    <p>The de­fender helped the Bavar­ian gi­ants win the tre­ble – the club’s sec­ond – com­pris­ing the Ger­man Cup, the Bun­desliga ti­tle and their sixth Euro­pean Cup.</p>
    <p>With Bay­ern form­ing the bulk of Die Mannschaft, the play­ers have now set their sights on Euro 2020, which has been post­poned un­til next June due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We have to keep the hunger for more ti­tles af­ter win­ning the tre­ble with Bay­ern,” said Suele, who tore his cru­ci­ate lig­a­ment last year, but re­turned in time to play in the 1-0 fi­nal vic­tory over French cham­pi­ons Paris Saint-Ger­main.</p>
    <p>“I now come here with a lot of joy, know­ing how hard it is to come back af­ter a 10-month ab­sence.</p>
    <p>“The Na­tions League is a good next step. We take any test, against any small or big op­po­nent, seriously be­cause we want to pre­pare for next sum­mer.”</p>
    <p>Ger­many, world cham­pi­ons in 2014, crashed out of the group stage in the 2018 World Cup, their ear­li­est exit in 80 years.</p>
    <p>They have since un­der­gone an over­haul and qual­i­fied with seven wins out of eight Euro 2020 qual­i­fiers.</p>
    <p>“We have the same hunger for ti­tles in the na­tional team as at Bay­ern,” Suele added.</p>
    <p>“There is no dif­fer­ence there. We have to wait and see how the new sea­son goes but I think we will have a team that will be com­pet­ing for the ti­tle at the Euro­pean Cham­pi­onship.”</p>
    <p>Ger­many are in League A, Group 4 in the Na­tions League. Af­ter the Spain game, they will travel to Switzer­land on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Due to their Euro­pean ex­er­tions, most of Bay­ern’s key play­ers in Leon Goret­zka, Joshua Kim­mich, Manuel Neuer and Serge Gnabry have been rested for both closed-door fix­tures.</p>
    <p>How­ever, their ab­sences give coach Joachim Low the chance to assess the fit­ness of for­mer Manch­ester City winger Leroy Sane and Suele.</p>
    <p>Sane, who joined Bay­ern in July in a €45 mil­lion (S$72.7 mil­lion) deal, missed all but one game with the Premier League side be­cause of a cru­ci­ate lig­a­ment in­jury.</p>
    <p>But the 24-year-old has now re­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>Low will, how­ever, still put out a strong side, in­clud­ing new Chelsea striker Timo Werner, and Suele feels it shows the strength and depth the coach has at his dis­posal.</p>
    <p>“We have im­prove­ment po­ten­tial and that is why these games are so im­por­tant,” he added.</p>
    <p>“It is not easy when you (the squad) meet ev­ery two, three months and it must al­ways work.</p>
    <p>“But we will have a team next year that will be ready to play for the ti­tle.”</p>
