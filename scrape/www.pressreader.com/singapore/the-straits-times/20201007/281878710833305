    <p>The num­ber of new Covid-19 cases daily in In­dia has con­tin­ued to drop, giv­ing rise to op­ti­mism that the pan­demic has hit a plateau in the world’s sec­ond-most pop­u­lous coun­try.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the health min­istry said new cases recorded in the last 24 hours stood at 61,267, a fig­ure con­firm­ing a nearly two-week down­ward trend. It hit 98,000 in mid-Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>The fi­nance min­istry, in its report on the eco­nomic out­look for Septem­ber, said the coun­try may have crossed the peak for in­fec­tions last month, set­ting the stage for eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>But it warned that the pan­demic was far from over, a cau­tious ap­proach mir­rored by epi­demi­ol­o­gists and health ex­perts.</p>
    <p>“We need to make sure this is sus­tained for two more weeks be­fore we can speak con­fi­dently that the curve is flat­tened... There are fac­tors com­ing into play which were not con­sid­ered in the past,” Dr Ran­deep Gu­le­ria, di­rec­tor of the All In­dia In­sti­tute of Med­i­cal Sci­ences in Delhi, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>He noted that some big Hindu fes­ti­vals were just around the cor­ner, in­clud­ing Dussehra and Deep­avali as well as state fes­tiv­i­ties like Ch­hath Puja.</p>
    <p>“These are so­cial func­tions where peo­ple gather. If we don’t fol­low Covid-19-ap­pro­pri­ate be­hav­iour in terms of phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing, there may be a spurt (in cases).</p>
    <p>“The sec­ond thing is how will the virus be­have dur­ing win­ter months. This is for North In­dia rather than the South.”</p>
    <p>In­dia, which cur­rently has more than 6.6 mil­lion cases and 103,569 deaths, im­posed a strict lock­down in March, shut­ting down all eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity and pre­vent­ing peo­ple from go­ing out of their houses. The re­stric­tions have slowly been loos­ened.</p>
    <p>In the lat­est such eas­ing, the fed­eral gov­ern­ment has al­lowed states to de­cide if they will re­open schools while cin­ema halls and the­atres are due to open from Oct 15, sub­ject to 50 per cent oc­cu­pancy.</p>
    <p>Much of the drop in in­fec­tions has been at­trib­uted to the big­ger cities, which have so far driven case num­bers in In­dia.</p>
    <p>The state of Ma­ha­rash­tra, home to the fi­nan­cial hub of Mum­bai and the auto hub of Pune, for in­stance, has been among the worst af­fected.</p>
    <p>But the num­ber of daily cases in the state has come down from about 22,000 at the be­gin­ning of Septem­ber to 10,244 on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Some ex­perts, ad­vis­ing cau­tion over the new num­bers, said a big fac­tor to con­sider is the sit­u­a­tion in the ru­ral ar­eas which were hit by the pan­demic long af­ter the cities.</p>
    <p>“In­dia is a large coun­try and the epi­demic is in dif­fer­ent stages in dif­fer­ent parts. In the lead are big cities fol­lowed by smaller cities. Vil­lages (ru­ral In­dia) are in the early phase of the pan­demic. I am hop­ing once cases in big cities come down, it will take the sting out of the epi­demic,” said epi­demi­ol­o­gist Jayaprakas­h Muliyil</p>
    <p>“Cer­tain things are in favour of ru­ral In­dia. They have lesser (pop­u­la­tion) den­sity,” he added.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts have also pointed to the prob­lem of un­der-re­port­ing.</p>
    <p>In­dian Coun­cil for Med­i­cal Re­search (ICMR) sero sur­veys, which check for an­ti­bod­ies in the blood to de­tect Covid-19, have found that far more peo­ple were in­fected than of­fi­cial fig­ures sug­gest. The lat­est sur­vey found that one in 15 In­di­ans was ex­posed to the coro­n­avirus by Au­gust and ICMR of­fi­cials ac­knowl­edge that a large sec­tion of the pop­u­la­tion re­mains vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>Test­ing data has also come in for some scru­tiny.</p>
    <p>“The num­bers of con­firmed cases are in­deed go­ing down but it’s hard to know if that is real. This is be­cause the de­ploy­ment of rapid anti­gen test­ing has in­creased over the past few weeks,” said vi­rol­o­gist Shahid Jameel.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts agree that at the end of the day, much will de­pend on whether peo­ple con­tinue to ob­serve pre­cau­tions or be­come lax with the econ­omy open­ing up and case num­bers com­ing down.</p>
