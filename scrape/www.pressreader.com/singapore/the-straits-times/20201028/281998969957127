    <p>Democ­ra­cies ev­ery­where must pre­pare for the con­tin­gency of a con­tested re­sult in the most im­por­tant US elec­tion in liv­ing memory.</p>
    <p>Learn­ing from the dis­ar­ray around the dis­puted 2000 elec­tion, they should have an in­for­mally co­or­di­nated stance.</p>
    <p>Lis­ten­ing to in­ter­na­tional elec­tion mon­i­tors, they should calmly wait as long as it takes for the ex­traor­di­nar­ily com­plex, de­cen­tralised US sys­tem to pro­duce a clear out­come.</p>
    <p>Mea­sured clar­ity from fel­low democ­ra­cies may con­trib­ute, at the mar­gin, to a more civilised Amer­i­can process and, more sub­stan­tially, calm the in­ter­na­tional en­vi­ron­ment around this febrile con­test.</p>
    <p>Back in 2000, for­eign lead­ers were all over the place. Among oth­ers, the Ger­man pres­i­dent ini­tially con­grat­u­lated can­di­date Ge­orge W. Bush, then with­drew his con­grat­u­la­tions. It took five weeks and the Supreme Court rul­ing in Bush ver­sus Gore to achieve clar­ity.</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion to­day is much worse than in 2000. Be­cause of Covid-19, more than half of all vot­ers are con­sid­er­ing vot­ing by post. That would make things dif­fi­cult even if the US had a cli­mate of Bud­dhist calm.</p>
    <p>But its po­lit­i­cal and me­dia land­scape is now so hy­per-po­larised that each side has its own facts, which for the other side are not facts at all.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has been fu­ri­ously sow­ing dis­trust of the le­git­i­macy of the elec­toral process, and es­pe­cially of postal votes. He re­cently tweeted: “This will be the most cor­rupt Elec­tion in Amer­i­can His­tory!”</p>
    <p>The in­ter­na­tional con­text is also less favourable. In 2000, it seemed the United States was the sole “hy­per­power” and democ­racy was tri­umph­ing around the globe.</p>
    <p>Now, the US is glob­ally chal­lenged by an au­thor­i­tar­ian China, and around the world there is a demo­cratic re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>If cur­rent opin­ion polls trans­late into votes in bat­tle­ground states, there may be no need to ac­ti­vate th­ese con­tin­gency plans. If Demo­crat Joe Bi­den is seen to have won key swing states al­ready on elec­tion night, re­spon­si­ble Repub­li­cans should promptly tell the Pres­i­dent that he must ac­cept the re­sult.</p>
    <p>But given that more Demo­crat than Repub­li­can vot­ers are re­quest­ing mail-in bal­lots, it is quite pos­si­ble that Mr Trump could be lead­ing on the night and then Mr Bi­den moves ahead as postal votes are counted.</p>
    <p>That “blue shift” sce­nario could mean days and even weeks of fu­ri­ous dis­putes, from polling sta­tions, through county, city and state elec­toral ad­min­is­tra­tions, to state and fed­eral courts.</p>
    <p>In a still worse case, the re­sult could end up hang­ing on a de­ci­sion of a Supreme Court whose com­po­si­tion is it­self the sub­ject of fierce par­ti­san dis­agree­ment: a re­peat of Bush ver­sus Gore, but on steroids.</p>
    <p>In the worst case of all, con­tro­versy could stretch into Jan­uary next year amid pos­si­ble vi­o­lence, mar­ket panic and world­wide dis­may.</p>
    <p>A calm, con­sid­ered ap­proach by the world’s other democ­ra­cies</p>
    <p>will be most rel­e­vant in the “blue shift” sce­nario.</p>
    <p>Th­ese coun­tries will have thou­sands of diplo­mats and jour­nal­ists on the ground. The US and in­ter­na­tional me­dia will be re­port­ing this event in­ten­sively, and Face­book and Twit­ter are go­ing to great lengths to stem mis­in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Al­though the facts will be dis­puted, that does not mean there will be no facts. A vi­tal task of lib­eral democ­ra­cies is to stick to and stand up for those facts.</p>
    <p>In do­ing this, they can rely on an elec­tion mon­i­tor­ing mis­sion from the Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Se­cu­rity and Co­op­er­a­tion in Europe (OSCE), which in­cludes the US among its 57 mem­bers.</p>
    <p>The group has con­ducted some 370 elec­tion ob­ser­va­tion mis­sions over 30 years and has, with US help, de­vel­oped bench­mark best prac­tices for rigour and im­par­tial­ity.</p>
    <p>The OSCE mis­sion has just pre­sented an in­terim re­port and will be hold­ing a press con­fer­ence in Wash­ing­ton the day af­ter elec­tion day on Nov 3.</p>
    <p>If, as in 2000, the dis­pute is de­cided by the Supreme Court, the world’s democ­ra­cies will surely have to ac­cept its ver­dict.</p>
    <p>But Stan­ford Univer­sity law pro­fes­sor Nathaniel Persily ar­gues that long be­fore any such ju­di­cial high noon, what will be de­ci­sive will be the ac­tions of in­nu­mer­able lo­cal and state of­fi­cials in the more than 10,000 ju­ris­dic­tions in­volved and of lower court judges.</p>
    <p>Some will be bi­ased, but the ma­jor­ity will be Amer­i­cans com­mit­ted to en­sur­ing that this time-hon­oured if some­what ram­shackle process is as free and fair as it can be in a time of Covid-19, pop­ulism and para­noia. They de­serve our quiet sup­port.</p>
    <p>The stakes are so high for us all. At worst, this could mark a fur­ther down­ward turn in a world­wide demo­cratic re­ces­sion. At best, it could be the be­gin­ning of a wider, global demo­cratic re­newal, so that gov­ern­ment of the peo­ple, by the peo­ple, for the peo­ple, should not per­ish from the earth.</p>

Utah is one of sev&#xAD;eral states that have moved to mail-in bal&#xAD;lots for the Nov 3 pres&#xAD;i&#xAD;den&#xAD;tial elec&#xAD;tion. Given that more Demo&#xAD;crat than Repub&#xAD;li&#xAD;can vot&#xAD;ers are re&#xAD;quest&#xAD;ing mail-in bal&#xAD;lots, it is quite pos&#xAD;si&#xAD;ble that Mr Don&#xAD;ald T rump could be lead&#xAD;ing on the night of the elec&#xAD;tion and then Mr Joe Bi&#xAD;den moves ahead as postal votes are counted, the writer says.</p>
