    <p>LON­DON • Crys­tal Palace de­fender Ma­madou Sakho has won “sub­stan­tial” dam­ages from the World Anti-Dop­ing Agency (Wada) over al­le­ga­tions he had taken banned per­for­mance-en­hanc­ing drugs.</p>
    <p>“I con­sider my­self in­no­cent,” he said in a state­ment. “To of­fi­cially re­ceive the apol­ogy from Wada was for me some­thing es­sen­tial in or­der to be able to defini­tively turn the page.”</p>
    <p>The former Liver­pool de­fender was briefly sus­pended in 2016 af­ter he tested pos­i­tive for a fat-burn­ing sub­stance called hi­ge­namine af­ter a Europa League game against Manch­ester United in March that year.</p>
    <p>He sub­se­quently missed the Reds’ Europa League fi­nal against Sevilla and, he also al­leged, a place in France’s Euro 2016 squad as a re­sult of his sus­pen­sion.</p>
    <p>He also claimed the wrong­ful sus­pen­sion cost him his ca­reer at An­field, with his lawyers ar­gu­ing that “his earn­ings as a player and the worth of his per­sonal brand were re­duced by his move away from Liver­pool”.</p>
    <p>The 30-year-old was ul­ti­mately cleared in July 2016 by Uefa’s dis­ci­plinary body, which found hi­ge­namine was not on Wada’s banned list and the agency’s own lab­o­ra­to­ries were un­sure about its sta­tus.</p>
    <p>Wada, how­ever, is­sued two state­ments, to The Daily Tele­graph in Au­gust 2016 and to The Guardian in April 2017, which said Sakho was guilty of tak­ing a pro­hib­ited per­for­mance-en­hanc­ing drug.</p>
    <p>It also ar­gued his sale to Palace was caused by “dis­ci­plinary is­sues” and a “per­son­al­ity clash” with man­ager Jur­gen Klopp.</p>
    <p>Sakho, who moved to Palace in 2017, sued Wada for defama­tion last year and, at a High Court hear­ing in Lon­don on Wed­nes­day, ac­cepted an apol­ogy from the body as well as an undis­closed sum in dam­ages.</p>
    <p>His bar­ris­ter, Ju­lian San­tos, said that the defam­a­tory al­le­ga­tions “were repub­lished by a very large num­ber of me­dia or­gan­i­sa­tions to many mil­lions of read­ers, caus­ing very se­ri­ous harm to Mr Sakho’s rep­u­ta­tion”.</p>
    <p>He added: “Wada has apol­o­gised and agreed to pay a sub­stan­tial sum by way of com­pen­sa­tion and not to re­peat the al­le­ga­tions.”</p>
    <p>Lawyer Guy Vas­sall-Adams, rep­re­sent­ing Wada, said: “Wada ac­cepts that it should not have made the defam­a­tory al­le­ga­tions it did... given that Mr Sakho had been ac­quit­ted by Uefa.</p>
    <p>“Wada ac­cepts that Mr Sakho did not breach the Uefa anti-dop­ing reg­u­la­tions, did not cheat, had no in­ten­tion of gain­ing any ad­van­tage and acted in good faith.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter the hear­ing, Sakho told re­porters: “I’m pleased with Wada’s ac­cep­tance that I did not breach the Uefa anti-dop­ing reg­u­la­tions, did not cheat, had no in­ten­tion of gain­ing any ad­van­tage and acted in good faith.</p>
    <p>“I am also pleased that Wada has apol­o­gised to me and agreed to pay a sub­stan­tial sum in dam­ages.</p>
    <p>“I con­sider my­self vin­di­cated and now look for­ward to con­tin­u­ing my ca­reer.</p>
    <p>“I feel happy, happy for my fam­ily, happy for all my friends, for all the peo­ple who were around me dur­ing this tough year be­cause it is not easy.</p>
    <p>“This is the worst thing you can be ac­cused of – dop­ing. Today is a big day for my story.”</p>
    <p>Hi­ge­namine, which is a chem­i­cal com­pound found in a va­ri­ety of plants and can act as a gen­eral stim­u­lant to in­crease car­diac out­put, has since been added to Wada’s pro­hib­ited list in 2017, and is now banned both in and out of com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
