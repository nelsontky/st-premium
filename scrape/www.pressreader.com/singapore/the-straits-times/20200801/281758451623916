    <p>• Aus­tralia’s Vic­to­ria state recorded its sec­ond-high­est day of new Covid-19 in­fec­tions yes­ter­day as its Premier re­buked res­i­dents for evad­ing lock­down and flagged the prospect of more rig­or­ous steps to con­tain the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria, whose cap­i­tal Mel­bourne is un­der a reim­posed sixweek stay-home or­der, re­ported 627 new in­fec­tions yes­ter­day, down from a record 723 the pre­vi­ous day.</p>
    <p>The state recorded eight more deaths linked to Covid-19, in­clud­ing two men in their 50s – from a record 14 the day be­fore.</p>
    <p>The state, which for months prided it­self on a tough ap­proach to so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, now ac­counts for more than half of Aus­tralia’s 198 deaths from the virus and about 60 per cent of the coun­try’s 16,900 cases.</p>
    <p>Most of Vic­to­ria’s new cases are in Mel­bourne, Aus­tralia’s sec­ond­biggest city.</p>
    <p>“It is clear to all of us that these num­bers are still far too high,” Premier Daniel An­drews told a news con­fer­ence. “It may well be the case... that we need to take fur­ther steps. The data will tell us, the ex­perts will tell us, what and if any next steps need to be.”</p>
    <p>De­fence and health of­fi­cials are knock­ing on the doors of ev­ery pos­i­tive Covid-19 case in the state, but have found one in four peo­ple not at home. Those peo­ple have been re­ferred to the po­lice and may face a A$1,652 (S$1,629) fine.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria is due to end lock­down on Aug 19 and is analysing how the virus is be­ing trans­mit­ted in the com­mu­nity, which will guide any new re­stric­tions, he added.</p>
    <p>With Mel­bourne en­ter­ing a fourth week of lock­down, many on the streets said they were sad­dened and anx­ious.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple are start­ing to feel de­pressed be­cause you can’t leave the house,” Mel­bourne res­i­dent Ste­fan Paskoski said. “All you do is go to work, come home if you’re work­ing. If you’re un­em­ployed, you rely on gov­ern­ment so­cial se­cu­rity.”</p>
    <p>Mr An­drews said the city of five mil­lion and the sur­round­ing ar­eas would be stuck in “limbo” un­less it could cut in­fec­tion rates.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son said the spike in cases in Mel­bourne re­mained a chal­lenge, but he was con­fi­dent a flare-up in larger Syd­ney was un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>“The level of com­mu­nity out­break and com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion in Vic­to­ria is the great chal­lenge down there,” he said.</p>
    <p>“And there’s still a lot of work to do and we’re not on top of it yet.”</p>
    <p>New South Wales state, of which Syd­ney is the cap­i­tal, had con­tained the virus mainly be­cause of bet­ter con­tact trac­ing than in neigh­bour­ing Vic­to­ria, he added.</p>
    <p>New South Wales recorded just 21 new cases.</p>
    <p>A ban on peo­ple trav­el­ling from Syd­ney to north­ern Queens­land state was set to be­gin at 1am to­day lo­cal time, and im­ages of traf­fic lines at the bor­der be­gan cir­cu­lat­ing on so­cial me­dia late yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“There will be de­lays at the bor­der, so think about your travel plans and think about where you need to go and think about the tim­ing of those jour­neys,” Queens­land Premier An­nasta­cia Palaszczuk said.</p>
    <p>De­fence and health of­fi­cials are knock­ing on the doors of ev­ery pos­i­tive Covid-19 case in the state, but have found one in four peo­ple not at home.</p>
    <p>Those peo­ple have been re­ferred to the po­lice and may face a A$1,652 (S$1,629) fine.</p>
