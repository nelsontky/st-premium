    <p>In­vest ed­i­tor Tan Ooi Boon’s ar­ti­cle on the quick­sand of over­spend­ing is timely as there are many sales on­go­ing (The quick­sand of over­spend­ing, Nov 29).</p>
    <p>We saw record-break­ing sales dur­ing the Nov 11 Sin­gles’ Day pro­mo­tion, and then there were long queues for the Black Fri­day sales. There are just too many op­por­tu­ni­ties for shop­pers to “spend in or­der to save”.</p>
    <p>The irony is that most of the time, we do not need to buy any­thing at all. One of the key rea­sons many peo­ple come un­der fi­nan­cial dis­tress is their overuse of credit cards.</p>
    <p>Many banks of­fer credit cards that pro­fess to give users bet­ter dis­counts or re­bates. Some peo­ple end up hav­ing sev­eral credit cards and spend­ing on a whim.</p>
    <p>The re­sult is that quite a num­ber of th­ese peo­ple can­not af­ford to pay their credit card bills on time, not even the in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>I hope that the au­thor­i­ties will re­strict the num­ber of credit cards a per­son can hold based on his an­nual in­come.</p>
    <p>Assess­ments should be car­ried out on credit card users to en­sure that their an­nual in­come jus­ti­fies the num­ber of cards they have.</p>
    <p>This would re­duce the like­li­hood of a per­son over­spend­ing on his credit cards and ul­ti­mately suf­fer­ing fi­nan­cial dis­tress.</p>
    <p>Banks must not push credit cards to a per­son who has more than two or three cards. Busi­ness in­ter­est aside, so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity should also be part of a bank’s mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Assess­ments should be car­ried out on credit card users to en­sure that their an­nual in­come jus­ti­fies the num­ber of cards they have.</p>
