    <p>With more than 60 per cent of new drug abusers caught last year un­der the age of 30, ef­forts to ar­rest the trend among young peo­ple will get a re­newed fo­cus from the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>A key plank in this fight will be to rope in par­ents and en­list their co­op­er­a­tion, said Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs and Na­tional Devel­op­ment Muham­mad Faishal Ibrahim.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing dur­ing a visit to the Com­mu­nity Re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion Cen­tre (CRC) in Ja­maica Road in Sem­bawang yes­ter­day, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Faishal added that the ex­ist­ing rein­te­gra­tion frame­work would be strength­ened so that for­mer drug ad­dicts do not re­lapse af­ter re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Said Prof Faishal: “Young peo­ple have many years ahead of them and when they start (abus­ing drugs), it dis­rupts not just their life as an in­di­vid­ual, but also their fam­ily and the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“I would like to urge par­ents to be con­cerned about drug abuse be­cause if they are not, our chil­dren, in­clud­ing mine, may be sus­cep­ti­ble to the syn­di­cates. That is why it is im­por­tant to con­tinue to bring the mes­sage of anti-drug use into homes.”</p>
    <p>He added that the Cen­tral Nar­cotics Bureau, Sin­ga­pore Prison Ser­vice (SPS) and other gov­ern­ment agen­cies will con­tinue to ex­pand their en­gage­ment with com­mu­nity part­ners “so that we will be able to give bet­ter re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion ser­vices to our friends who may have made a bad choice, nev­er­the­less we will need the sup­port of the com­mu­nity”.</p>
    <p>He also called for more vol­un­teers to be brought on board to im­prove the after­care com­po­nent of the ex­ist­ing re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion frame­work.</p>
    <p>“We need fam­i­lies, com­mu­nity part­ners to deepen the jour­ney and make it eas­ier for ex-of­fend­ers to rein­te­grate into their fam­i­lies and the so­ci­ety,” he said.</p>
    <p>The CRC was set up in 2014 by SPS as a step-down ar­range­ment for first-time youth drug abusers who have com­pleted a short de­ten­tion at the drug re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion cen­tre. It cur­rently houses 30 res­i­dents aged 16 to 21.</p>
    <p>One of the res­i­dents at the cen­tre, 21-year-old Haikal (name changed), who joined the CRC in May, said he started abus­ing drugs at 14 when he was in­tro­duced to them by friends.</p>
    <p>Since join­ing the cen­tre, he has at­tended coun­selling sup­port and drug in­ter­ven­tion group ses­sions and se­cured a job in the food and bev­er­age sec­tor about two months ago.</p>
    <p>The youngest of seven chil­dren, he said his fam­ily’s sup­port helped him stay strong through his with­drawal and re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Said Haikal: “It was dis­ap­point­ing for my par­ents and sib­lings when they found out about my drug use. But my fam­ily vis­ited me while I was here and mo­ti­vated me to do bet­ter.</p>
    <p>“When I leave, I want to sign on af­ter na­tional ser­vice and be­come a fire­man. I have now made a prom­ise to my­self to not go back to drugs.”</p>
    <p>SPS part­ners the Youth Guid­ance Out­reach Ser­vices, a youth-fo­cused so­cial ser­vice agency, to be the man­ag­ing agent of the CRC.</p>
    <p>Not­ing the role of so­cial ser­vice agen­cies and vol­un­teers in build­ing re­silience against drug abuse in so­ci­ety, Prof Faishal urged more groups to part­ner the Gov­ern­ment in ex­pand­ing pre­ven­tion, re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion and rein­te­gra­tion ef­forts.</p>
    <p>PAR­ENTS HAVE PART TO PLAY</p>
    <p>I would like to urge par­ents to be con­cerned about drug abuse be­cause if they are not, our chil­dren, in­clud­ing mine, may be sus­cep­ti­ble to the syn­di­cates. MIN­IS­TER OF STATE FOR HOME AF­FAIRS AND NA­TIONAL DEVEL­OP­MENT MUHAM­MAD FAISHAL IBRAHIM</p>
