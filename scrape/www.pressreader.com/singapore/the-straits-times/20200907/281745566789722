    <p>NEW DELHI In­dia added more than 90,000 cases of the coron­avirus yes­ter­day, a global daily record, ac­cord­ing to data from the fed­eral Health Min­istry.</p>
    <p>There were 90,632 new cases over a 24-hour pe­riod lead­ing into yes­ter­day, ac­cord­ing to the data from the Min­istry of Health and Fam­ily Wel­fare, while the num­ber of deaths rose by 1,065 to 70,626.</p>
    <p>The coun­try is set to pass Brazil to­day as the sec­ond-most af­fected coun­try by to­tal in­fec­tions and will be be­hind only the United States, which has over 6.2 mil­lion cases and nearly 190,000 deaths, ac­cord­ing to Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Coron­avirus cases in In­dia have crossed 4.1 mil­lion, and about 3.2 mil­lion af­fected peo­ple have been treated so far, the gov­ern­ment data showed.</p>
    <p>Med­i­cal ex­perts said the coun­try was see­ing a sec­ond wave of the pan­demic in some parts of the coun­try, and that case num­bers have surged be­cause of in­creased test­ing and the eas­ing of re­stric­tions on pub­lic move­ment.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment will par­tially re­store metro train ser­vice in the na­tional cap­i­tal of New Delhi from to­day.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic will not end this year as the virus has spread from big cities to other parts of the coun­try, Dr Ran­deep Gu­le­ria, the di­rec­tor of the All In­dia In­sti­tute of Med­i­cal Sci­ences in New Delhi, told In­dia To­day TV last Sat­ur­day.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of cases could con­tinue to rise be­fore the curve flat­tens out, he said.</p>
    <p>In­dia has been log­ging the world’s largest daily coron­avirus case load for al­most a month, even as its gov­ern­ment pushes to open busi­nesses to re­vive a con­tract­ing econ­omy.</p>
