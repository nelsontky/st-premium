    <p>LON­DON • The Royal Bal­let, Bri­tain’s largest bal­let com­pany, leapt back into ac­tion last Fri­day af­ter seven months of Covid-19 gloom, with an ex­trav­a­ganza that mixed clas­sics such as Romeo And Juliet and Don Quixote with play­ful mod­ern dance.</p>
    <p>In a three-hour live-streamed per­for­mance from the Royal Opera House in cen­tral Lon­don, around 70 dancers bounded from Romeo And Juliet, Swan Lake and Don Quixote to­wards a fi­nale of Ken­neth MacMil­lan’s wild Elite Syn­co­pa­tions.</p>
    <p>Re­stric­tions im­posed to slow the spread of the novel coro­n­avirus have bat­tered the per­form­ing arts across the globe: Theatres and con­cert halls have lain empty for months and many mu­si­cians, ac­tors and dancers have been stuck at home.</p>
    <p>The last ma­jor bal­let they per­formed was Swan Lake on March 12, just days be­fore Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son shut­tered the Bri­tish econ­omy and told the coun­try to stay at home.</p>
    <p>Marcelino Sambe, a prin­ci­pal dancer from Por­tu­gal, told Reuters: “It’s like seven months of pent-up en­ergy, ex­cite­ment to de­velop fur­ther.</p>
    <p>“This is what we did all that train­ing for – to per­form, to share this art. And to not have been do­ing that for so long, it re­ally causes a lot of dis­tress, re­ally, and it’s in­cred­i­ble that we get to be back on this glo­ri­ous stage.”</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has dealt a dev­as­tat­ing blow to bal­let and other per­form­ing arts, which also draw cus­tom to once thriv­ing restau­rants and bars of Lon­don that now lie silent or closed.</p>
    <p>Kevin O’Hare, direc­tor of the Royal Bal­let, said: “Frankly, it is a re­ally bad sit­u­a­tion for the Opera House. We have to be per­form­ing. We’ve lost, I think, £3 in ev­ery £5 be­cause we’re not per­form­ing.”</p>
    <p>He said pre­cau­tions had been taken across the pro­duc­tion – from cos­tume fit­ting to so­cial dis­tanc­ing back­stage to danc­ing cou­ples work­ing only to­gether.</p>
    <p>For dancers who need to keep fit and per­fect com­pli­cated fou­ettes, prac­tice dur­ing the pan­demic has been dif­fi­cult. They are, though, hun­gry to get on stage.</p>
    <p>Anna Rose O’Sul­li­van, first soloist, said: “It is prob­a­bly the long­est time, other than (be­cause of) in­juries that dancers may have had, that we’ve all been away from our daily rou­tine and our train­ing as we know it and per­form­ing on stage.</p>
    <p>“All of our classes were via Zoom. So we were look­ing at a lap­top and, you know, the post­man would walk by and think, what’s she do­ing in there, while I was do­ing my daily class and train­ing.”</p>
    <p>The Royal Opera House will also use the event to see how it can get au­di­ences back into live per­for­mances.</p>
    <p>O’Sul­li­van said: “The fact that we’ve been away from it for so long has made us hun­gry and more re­silient and ap­pre­ci­ate it as well – what we do and how much we en­joy per­form­ing.”</p>

        <p data-role="text">(Above) First soloist Anna Rose O&#x2019;Sul&#xAD;li&#xAD;van says the lock&#xAD;down has made her and her fel&#xAD;low dancers more hun&#xAD;gry to per&#xAD;form and also more ap&#xAD;pre&#xAD;cia&#xAD;tive of what they do. (Left) Thrilled to be on stage again, the Royal Bal&#xAD;let bounded from Romeo And Juliet, Swan Lake and Don Quixote to&#xAD;wards a fi&#xAD;nale of Ken&#xAD;neth MacMil&#xAD;lan&#x2019;s wild Elite Syn&#xAD;co&#xAD;pa&#xAD;tions (left).</p>
