    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has “ter­mi­nated” De­fence Sec­re­tary Mark Esper, sig­nalling he may use his fi­nal months in of­fice af­ter de­feat at the polls to set­tle scores within his ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump had split with Mr Esper over a range of is­sues and was par­tic­u­larly an­gered by his pub­lic op­po­si­tion to Mr Trump’s threats to use ac­tive duty mil­i­tary forces this sum­mer to sup­press street protests over racial in­jus­tice af­ter po­lice killed un­armed black Amer­i­can Ge­orge Floyd in Min­neapo­lis.</p>
    <p>Mr Esper’s fir­ing was quickly fol­lowed by spec­u­la­tion that Mr Trump was not fin­ished: Mr Christo­pher Wray, the FBI direc­tor, and Ms Gina Haspel, the CIA direc­tor, could be next, ac­cord­ing to ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>Re­mov­ing these se­nior of­fi­cials – in ef­fect de­cap­i­tat­ing the na­tional se­cu­rity bu­reau­cracy dur­ing the un­cer­tain time be­tween ad­min­is­tra­tions – is hardly with­out risks.</p>
    <p>But Mr Trump en­joys fir­ing peo­ple, two se­nior ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials said on Mon­day. The loom­ing end of his pres­i­dency, the of­fi­cials said, gave him only two more months to ex­er­cise his priv­i­lege to fire. And by an­nounc­ing the De­fence Sec­re­tary’s ouster, Mr Trump was seen as seek­ing to re­claim even a bit of the post-elec­tion nar­ra­tive, which has been dom­i­nated by Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s vic­tory.</p>
    <p>Democrats re­acted with alarm, say­ing Mr Trump’s move on Mon­day sent a dan­ger­ous mes­sage to Amer­ica’s ad­ver­saries and dimmed hopes for an orderly tran­si­tion as Mr Bi­den pre­pares to take of­fice.</p>
    <p>“The abrupt fir­ing of Sec­re­tary Esper is dis­turb­ing ev­i­dence that Pres­i­dent Trump is in­tent on us­ing his fi­nal days in of­fice to sow chaos in our Amer­i­can Democ­racy and around the world,” said House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives Speaker Nancy Pelosi.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump said on Twit­ter that Na­tional Coun­tert­er­ror­ism Cen­tre direc­tor Christo­pher Miller was tak­ing over as act­ing sec­re­tary of de­fence. “Mark Esper has been ter­mi­nated,” Mr Trump wrote in a tweet, adding that Mr Miller would be act­ing sec­re­tary “ef­fec­tive im­me­di­ately”.</p>
    <p>Sources said Mr Esper had long been pre­par­ing for his res­ig­na­tion or dis­missal fol­low­ing last week’s elec­tion. De­fence De­part­ment of­fi­cials have pri­vately ex­pressed wor­ries that Mr Trump might ini­ti­ate op­er­a­tions, overt or se­cret, against Iran or other ad­ver­saries dur­ing his last days in of­fice.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the White House has re­moved Mr Michael Ku­per­berg, ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of the US Global Change Re­search Pro­gramme, in what crit­ics in­ter­preted as the lat­est sign that the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion in­tends to use its re­main­ing months in of­fice to con­tinue im­ped­ing cli­mate sci­ence and pol­icy.</p>
