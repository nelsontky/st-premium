    <p>•</p>
    <p>LONDON The au­thor­i­ties in Bri­tain’s sec­ond l argest city of Birm­ing­ham have an­nounced new coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions as the na­tion’s vi­ral re­pro­duc­tion rate, or R num­ber, ex­ceeded 1.0 for the first time since March.</p>
    <p>From Tues­day, more than 1.1 mil­lion peo­ple will be banned from mix­ing with any other household, af­ter the rate of in­fec­tion in Birm­ing­ham rose from 30 to 75 cases per 100,000 peo­ple over a week last month.</p>
    <p>“I know this is dif­fi­cult, par­tic­u­larly when we have got used to see­ing friends and fam­ily,” said Mr</p>
    <p>Ian Ward, leader of Birm­ing­ham City Coun­cil, on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“But it is vi­tal we stick to th­ese rules and pro­tect each other, given the sud­den rise in in­fec­tion rate.”</p>
    <p>He added: “The virus has not gone away, it has not weak­ened, in fact it is re­lent­less and we must be re­lent­less in our ef­forts to con­trol the spread.”</p>
    <p>Bri­tain has suf­fered the dead­li­est out­break of Covid-19 in Europe. An­other six deaths were re­ported on Fri­day, tak­ing the to­tal to 41,614.</p>
    <p>Cases fell over the sum­mer months but are now ris­ing sharply, with 3,539 new in­fec­tions recorded on Fri­day – the high­est daily fig­ure since May 17, bring­ing the to­tal to 361,677.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment con­firmed the trend on Fri­day by say­ing the R num­ber was now 1.0 to 1.2 across the coun­try. The re­pro­duc­tion rate mea­sures the num­ber of peo­ple in a pop­u­la­tion, on av­er­age, in­fected by each per­son car­ry­ing the virus.</p>
    <p>Any num­ber above 1.0 in­di­cates the dis­ease is ex­pand­ing.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, coro­n­avirus rules were tight­ened across the coun­try last week, with Eng­land and Scot­land no­tably an­nounc­ing bans on meet­ings of more than six peo­ple from dif­fer­ent house­holds.</p>
    <p>“We are now en­ter­ing a phase of in­creas­ing trans­mis­sion as we head into the au­tumn,” noted Pro­fes­sor Azra Ghani, chair in In­fec­tious Dis­ease Epi­demi­ol­ogy at Im­pe­rial Col­lege London.</p>
