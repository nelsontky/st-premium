    <p>A 24-year-old woman, who was ex­tremely drunk af­ter a night out club­bing, was pulled into a car and fon­dled by three men in the ve­hi­cle as the group headed for a Pasir Ris chalet.</p>
    <p>At D’Re­sort @ Down­town East chalet, the un­con­scious woman was raped by one man and sex­u­ally as­saulted by an­other, while a third man furtively filmed the at­tack on his phone.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, one of her as­sailants, Tay Boon Huat, 28, was sen­tenced to 10 years and three months’ jail, and five strokes of the cane.</p>
    <p>He pleaded guilty to a charge of sex­ual as­sault by pen­e­tra­tion for forc­ing him­self on the vic­tim on the morn­ing of Sept 17, 2018, as well as an un­re­lated charge of ri­ot­ing.</p>
    <p>Tay is the sec­ond man to be con­victed for his role in the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Last year, Gan Soon Chai, 35, who filmed the as­sault, was sen­tenced to 15 months’ jail and a fine of $20,800.</p>
    <p>The cases in­volv­ing two oth­ers – Yap Chun Chieh, 40, who is ac­cused of rap­ing the vic­tim, and Yong Chun Hong, 31, who is said to have fon­dled her – are still pend­ing.</p>
    <p>The High Court heard yes­ter­day that Tay had booked the chalet for his friends.</p>
    <p>Af­ter mid­night on Sept 17, four of them trav­elled to Club V5 Ty­coon at Ming Ar­cade in Cus­ca­den Road. They were Tay, Gan, Yong and Mr Yeo We Chieng, 40, who drove them there.</p>
    <p>The woman ar­rived at about 3.35am with her friends, af­ter hav­ing had drinks at an­other club, and pro­ceeded to have more al­co­hol.</p>
    <p>At about 6am, Yong spent about 15 min­utes alone with her in the toi­let. He then passed her over to Yap, telling him to send her home by taxi.</p>
    <p>Both Yong and Yap worked at the club as man­agers-cum-bounc­ers.</p>
    <p>On the drive back to the chalet, the four men spot­ted Yap with the woman. Yong in­vited Yap to join them at the chalet and pulled the woman by her arm into the car.</p>
    <p>The group ar­rived at the chalet at about 7.25am, and Mr Yeo soon fell asleep.</p>
    <p>When the woman was home later, she knew that some­thing had hap­pened to her but did not know what to do.</p>
    <p>That night, she went to the club to talk to a friend about the in­ci­dent and recog­nised Yap.</p>
    <p>Days later, she ap­proached Yap, who apol­o­gised for hav­ing sex with her at the chalet.</p>
    <p>She later made a po­lice re­port.</p>
