    <p>The up­com­ing al­bum of English singer Sam Smith (be­low) may have been born of heart­break af­ter a failed re­la­tion­ship, but the 28-year-old de­scribes it as a more dance and pop work com­pared with pre­vi­ous records. Smith says: “It’s lighter. I didn’t want to be de­pressed in the stu­dio – (in­stead) it be­came a safe space for fun and play this time around.”</p>
    <p>English singer Sam Smith’s up­com­ing al­bum Love Goes may have been born of heart­break af­ter a failed re­la­tion­ship, but the 28-yearold is rar­ing to get back on the dat­ing scene.</p>
    <p>“I’m so ready – ready to love, ready for heart­break and mis­ery, and for it all to come,” Smith says dur­ing a re­gional Zoom press con­fer­ence on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The singer, who iden­ti­fies as non-bi­nary, goes by the pro­nouns they, them and their.</p>
    <p>Smith was in an eight month-long re­la­tion­ship with 13 Rea­sons Why ac­tor Bran­don Flynn be­fore they parted ways in mid-2018.</p>
    <p>The singer of hit bal­lad Too Good At Good­byes is not one to shy away from draw­ing on pain and grief to cre­ate mu­sic, hav­ing made a ca­reer of it since de­but­ing with the Grammy-win­ning al­bum In The Lonely Hour (2014).</p>
    <p>The record spawned hit sin­gles such as Stay With Me and Lay Me</p>
    <p>Down, and was fol­lowed by The Thrill Of It All (2017).</p>
    <p>But Smith’s third al­bum, Love Goes, due out on Oct 30, is de­scribed more as a dance and pop work.</p>
    <p>Smith says: “It’s lighter. I didn’t want to be de­pressed in the stu­dio – (in­stead) it be­came a safe space for fun and play this time around.”</p>
    <p>The dif­fer­ence is no­tice­able – whether it is the snappy beats on How Do You Sleep or the pop hook on the sul­try Danc­ing With A Stranger, which fea­tures Amer­i­can singer Nor­mani.</p>
    <p>Un­like Smith’s pre­vi­ous al­bums, Love Goes “is not nec­es­sar­ily one you lis­ten to from start to fin­ish – (or an al­bum) that is one emo­tion and story”.</p>
    <p>“I feel like with this al­bum, you see the scope of my mu­si­cal taste. So, when you’re lis­ten­ing to the record, I’d say treat each one like a sep­a­rate movie.</p>
    <p>“That’s why I used the flow­ers (on the al­bum cover) – each song has a dif­fer­ent feel­ing and emo­tion.”</p>
    <p>Smith’s ex­plo­ration of dance mu­sic ex­tends to the chore­ographed rou­tines they per­form in the mu­sic videos for How Do You Sleep and the lat­est sin­gle Di­a­monds.</p>
    <p>“Danc­ing for the first time (on those songs) was such a free­ing ex­pe­ri­ence be­cause to dance well, you have to let your head go, and your arms, and be a bit freer with your body.”</p>
    <p>It is part of what Smith de­scribes</p>
    <p>The in­cred­i­ble re­ac­tion to my first record and the fame that came with it... af­fected my writ­ing a lit­tle bit. But what’s changed for me is that with this al­bum, I don’t care any­more what any­one thinks. What I gen­uinely care about is mak­ing some­thing that makes me happy, makes me smile.</p>
    <p>as a “sec­ond com­ing-out” jour­ney.</p>
    <p>“The in­cred­i­ble re­ac­tion to my first record and the fame that came with it def­i­nitely af­fected my cre­ativ­ity. For the first time ever, I was in the stu­dio know­ing that there were go­ing to be peo­ple wait­ing to hear my mu­sic and that af­fected my writ­ing a lit­tle bit.</p>
    <p>“But what’s changed for me is that with this al­bum, I don’t care any­more what any­one thinks. What I gen­uinely care about is mak­ing some­thing that makes me happy, makes me smile.”</p>
    <p>Smith has clearly moved on from wal­low­ing in heart­break.</p>
    <p>“I have so much to look for­ward to and I’ve made lit­tle plans that I’m ex­cited about. When I’m 32, I’m go­ing to get a dog and at 34, I’m go­ing to have a baby.</p>
    <p>“Mu­si­cally, for me, I’m re­ally ex­cited to ex­plore the way I’m feel­ing. I’m writ­ing all the time and I feel like as I get older, my mu­sic’s get­ting bet­ter.”</p>
