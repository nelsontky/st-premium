    <p>WHAT IS QANON?</p>
    <p>QAnon is the um­brella term for a sprawl­ing set of In­ter­net con­spir­acy the­o­ries that al­lege, falsely, that the world is run by a ca­bal of Satan­wor­ship­ping pae­dophiles who are plot­ting against Mr Trump while oper­at­ing a global child sex-traf­fick­ing ring.</p>
    <p>QAnon fol­low­ers be­lieve this clique in­cludes top Democrats like Mr Barack Obama and Mrs Hil­lary Clin­ton, in­vestor Ge­orge Soros, a num­ber of en­ter­tain­ers and Hol­ly­wood celebri­ties such as Oprah Win­frey, Tom Hanks and Ellen De­Generes, and re­li­gious fig­ures in­clud­ing Pope Fran­cis and the Dalai Lama. Many of them also be­lieve that, in ad­di­tion to mo­lest­ing chil­dren, mem­bers of this group kill and eat their vic­tims to ex­tract a life-ex­tend­ing chem­i­cal from their blood.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to QAnon lore, Mr Trump was re­cruited by top mil­i­tary gen­er­als to run for pres­i­dent in 2016 in order to break up this crim­i­nal con­spir­acy, end its con­trol of pol­i­tics and the me­dia, and bring its mem­bers to jus­tice.</p>
    <p>Is that all? Not by a long shot. Since it be­gan, QAnon has in­cor­po­rated el­e­ments of many other con­spir­acy the­ory com­mu­ni­ties, in­clud­ing claims about the as­sas­si­na­tion of John F. Kennedy, the ex­is­tence of UFOs, and the 9/11 “truther” move­ment.</p>
    <p>QAnon Anony­mous, a pod­cast about the QAnon move­ment, calls QAnon a “big tent con­spir­acy the­ory” be­cause it is con­stantly evolv­ing and adding new fea­tures and claims. But the ex­is­tence of a global pae­dophile ca­bal is the core tenet of QAnon, and the one that most, if not all, of its fol­low­ers be­lieve.</p>
    <p>HOW DID THIS ALL START?</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber 2017, a post ap­peared on 4chan, the no­to­ri­ously toxic mes­sage board, from an anony­mous ac­count call­ing it­self “Q Clear­ance Pa­triot”. This poster, who be­came known sim­ply as “Q”, claimed to be a high-rank­ing in­tel­li­gence of­fi­cer with ac­cess to clas­si­fied in­for­ma­tion about Mr Trump’s war against the global ca­bal.</p>
    <p>Q pre­dicted that this war would soon cul­mi­nate in “The Storm” – an ap­pointed time when Mr Trump would fi­nally un­mask the ca­bal, pun­ish its mem­bers for their crimes and re­store Amer­ica to great­ness.</p>
    <p>WHY IS IT CALLED ‘THE STORM’?</p>
    <p>It’s a ref­er­ence to a cryp­tic re­mark Mr Trump made dur­ing an Oc­to­ber 2017 photo op. Pos­ing along­side mil­i­tary gen­er­als, he said: “You guys know what this rep­re­sents? Maybe it’s the calm be­fore the storm.” QAnon be­liev­ers pointed to this mo­ment as proof that Mr Trump was send­ing coded mes­sages about his plans to break up the global ca­bal, with the help of the mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>WHO IS Q, AND WHAT ARE ‘Q DROPS’?</p>
    <p>Q’s iden­tity is still un­known, although there have been hints and spec­u­la­tion about it for years. Some spec­u­late that a sin­gle In­ter­net troll has been post­ing as Q the en­tire time; oth­ers say that mul­ti­ple peo­ple are in­volved in post­ing as Q, or that Q’s iden­tity has changed over time.</p>
    <p>Mak­ing things more com­pli­cated is that Q’s on­line home base has changed sev­eral times. Q’s posts orig­i­nally ap­peared on 4chan. Then they moved to 8chan, where they stayed un­til that site was taken off­line last year after the El Paso, Texas, mass shoot­ing. They now live on 8kun, a site run by the former owner of 8chan. Each of these sites uses a sys­tem of iden­tity ver­i­fi­ca­tion known as a “trip­code” – es­sen­tially, a unique dig­i­tal sig­na­ture that proves that a series of anony­mous posts were writ­ten by the same per­son or peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“Drops” are what QAnon fol­low­ers call Q’s posts. There have been nearly 5,000 of them so far, and most take the form of a cryp­tic coded mes­sage. Here’s an ex­am­ple of a Q drop from Septem­ber 2018:</p>
    <p>PANIC IN DC</p>
    <p>(LL) talking = TRUTH TAR­MAC (BC)?</p>
    <p>re­veal</p>
    <p>(LL) talking = TRUTH re­veal COMEY HRC EMAIL CASE?</p>
    <p>(LL) talking = TRUTH re­veal HUS­SEIN in­struc­tions re: HRC EMAIL CASE?</p>
    <p>(LL) talking = TRUTH re­veal BREN</p>
    <p>NAN NO NAME COORD TO FRAME POTUS?……………..FISA = START</p>
    <p>FISA BRINGS DOWN THE HOUSE.WHEN DO BIRDS SING?</p>
    <p>Q</p>
    <p>In this post, you can see coded ref­er­ences to “LL” (Loretta Lynch, Mr Obama’s former at­tor­ney-gen­eral), “BC” (Bill Clin­ton), “HRC” (Hil­lary Rod­ham Clin­ton), and “HUS­SEIN” (Obama), along with ref­er­ences to former CIA di­rec­tor John Bren­nan, the For­eign In­tel­li­gence Sur­veil­lance Act, and “Potus” – Trump.</p>
    <p>Many QAnon fol­low­ers use “Q Drop” apps that col­lect all of Q’s posts in one place, and alert them every time a new post ar­rives. (One of these apps hit the top 10 paid apps in Ap­ple’s App Store be­fore it was pulled down for vi­o­lat­ing the com­pany’s guide­lines.) They then post these drops in Face­book groups, chat rooms for the Dis­cord chat app and Twit­ter threads, and be­gin dis­cussing and de­bat­ing what it all means.</p>
    <p>IS QANON THE SAME THING AS PIZZAGATE?</p>
    <p>Yes and no. QAnon has been de­scribed as a “big-bud­get se­quel” to Pizzagate, be­cause it takes the orig­i­nal Pizzagate con­spir­acy the­ory – which al­leged, falsely, that Mrs Hil­lary Clin­ton and her cronies were oper­at­ing a child sex-traf­fick­ing ring out of the base­ment of a</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton pizza restau­rant – and adds many more lay­ers of nar­ra­tive on top of it. But many peo­ple be­lieve in both the­o­ries, and for many QAnon be­liev­ers, Pizzagate rep­re­sented a kind of con­spir­acy the­ory on-ramp.</p>
    <p>One new el­e­ment in QAnon is a num­ber of clear and spe­cific pre­dic­tions about when and how “The Storm” would play out. For years, Q has pre­dicted that mass ar­rests of ca­bal mem­bers would oc­cur on cer­tain days, that cer­tain gov­ern­ment re­ports would re­veal the ca­bal’s mis­deeds, and that Repub­li­cans would win nu­mer­ous seats in the 2018 midterm elec­tions.</p>
    <p>None of those pre­dic­tions came true. But most QAnon be­liev­ers didn’t care. They sim­ply found ways to re­frame the nar­ra­tive and ig­nore the dis­crep­an­cies, and moved on.</p>
    <p>HOW MANY PEO­PLE BE­LIEVE IN QANON?</p>
    <p>It’s hard to say, be­cause there’s no of­fi­cial mem­ber­ship di­rec­tory, but the num­ber is not small. Even if you count only the hard­core QAnon be­liev­ers – ex­clud­ing “QAnon-lite” ad­her­ents who might be­lieve in a deep state plot against Mr Trump, but not a ca­bal of child-eat­ing sa­tanists – the num­ber may be at least in the hun­dreds of thou­sands.</p>
    <p>Some of the most pop­u­lar QAnon groups on Face­book have more than 100,000 mem­bers apiece, and Twit­ter re­cently an­nounced it was tak­ing ac­tions to limit the reach of more than 150,000 QAnon-as­so­ci­ated ac­counts. A re­cent re­port by NBC News found that Face­book had con­ducted an in­ter­nal study of QAnon’s pres­ence on its plat­form, and it con­cluded that there were thou­sands of QAnon groups, with mil­lions of mem­bers be­tween them.</p>
    <p>That num­ber has prob­a­bly grown dur­ing the pan­demic, as peo­ple stuck in­doors turn to the In­ter­net for en­ter­tain­ment and so­cial­is­ing and wind up be­ing pulled into the QAnon com­mu­nity. A re­cent ar­ti­cle in The Wall Street Jour­nal found that mem­ber­ship in 10 large Face­book groups de­voted to QAnon had grown by more than 600 per cent since the start of lock­downs.</p>
    <p>WHY ARE SOME PEO­PLE AT­TRACTED TO THE QANON MOVE­MENT?</p>
    <p>A com­mon mis­con­cep­tion is that QAnon is purely a po­lit­i­cal move­ment. But it func­tions – for peo­ple who be­lieve in it – as both a so­cial com­mu­nity and a source of en­ter­tain­ment.</p>
    <p>Some peo­ple have com­pared QAnon to a mas­sive mul­ti­player on­line game, be­cause of the way it in­vites par­tic­i­pants to co-cre­ate a kind of shared re­al­ity filled with re­cur­ring char­ac­ters, shift­ing story lines and in­tri­cate puz­zle-solv­ing quests. QAnon has also been com­pared to a church, in that it pro­vides its fol­low­ers with a so­cial sup­port struc­ture as well as an or­gan­is­ing nar­ra­tive for their ev­ery­day lives.</p>
    <p>Game de­signer Adrian Hon, who has writ­ten about QAnon’s sim­i­lar­ity to al­ter­nate-re­al­ity games, says that be­liev­ers “open a fas­ci­nat­ing fan­tasy world of se­cret wars and ca­bals and Hil­lary Clin­ton con­trol­ling things, and it of­fers con­ve­nient ex­pla­na­tions for things that feel in­ex­pli­ca­ble or wrong about the world”.</p>
    <p>WHAT ROLES HAVE SO­CIAL NET­WORKS PLAYED IN QANON’S POP­U­LAR­ITY?</p>
    <p>Even though Q’s posts ap­pear on fringe mes­sage boards, the QAnon phe­nom­e­non owes much of its pop­u­lar­ity to Twit­ter, Face­book and YouTube, which have am­pli­fied QAnon mes­sages and rec­om­mended QAnon groups and pages to new peo­ple through their al­go­rithms.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, QAnon be­liev­ers have used so­cial me­dia to ha­rass, in­tim­i­date and threaten their per­ceived en­e­mies, and to seed other types of mis­in­for­ma­tion that wind up in­flu­enc­ing pub­lic de­bate. Sev­eral of the most pop­u­lar con­spir­acy the­o­ries on the In­ter­net this year – such as “Plan­demic”, a doc­u­men­tary con­tain­ing false and dan­ger­ous claims about Covid-19, and a vi­ral con­spir­acy the­ory that falsely claimed that Way­fair, the on­line fur­ni­ture com­pany, was traf­fick­ing chil­dren – have been am­pli­fied and pop­u­larised by QAnon fol­low­ers.</p>
    <p>Some of these net­works have started try­ing to re­move QAnon con­tent from their plat­forms. Twit­ter re­cently banned thou­sands of QAnon ac­counts, say­ing they had en­gaged in co­or­di­nated ha­rass­ment. Face­book is re­port­edly com­ing up with its own QAnon con­tain­ment strat­egy. But these in­ter­ven­tions may be too lit­tle, too late.</p>
    <p>HAVEN’T THERE AL­WAYS BEEN FAR-FETCHED CON­SPIR­ACY THE­O­RIES ABOUT POW­ER­FUL ELITES?</p>
    <p>It’s true that much of QAnon’s sub­ject mat­ter is re­cy­cled from ear­lier con­spir­acy the­o­ries. But QAnon is fun­da­men­tally an In­ter­net-based move­ment that op­er­ates in a dif­fer­ent way, and at a dif­fer­ent scale, than any­thing we’ve seen be­fore.</p>
    <p>For starters, QAnon is deeply par­tic­i­pa­tory, in a way that few other pop­u­lar con­spir­acy the­o­ries have been. Fol­low­ers con­gre­gate in chat rooms and Face­book groups to de­code the lat­est Q posts, dis­cuss their the­o­ries about the news of the day, and bond with their fel­low be­liev­ers. The At­lantic has called it “the birth of a new re­li­gion”. There’s also the basic dan­ger of what QAnon fol­low­ers ac­tu­ally be­lieve. It’s one thing to have a po­larised po­lit­i­cal dis­course with heated dis­agree­ments; it’s another to have a fac­tion of Amer­i­cans who think, with com­plete sin­cer­ity, that the lead­ers of the op­po­si­tion party are kid­nap­ping and can­ni­bal­is­ing in­no­cent chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Com­bine those vi­o­lent, para­noid fan­tasies with the fact that QAnon fol­low­ers have been charged with com­mit­ting se­ri­ous crimes in Q’s name, and it’s no won­der peo­ple are wor­ried.</p>
    <p>HOW HAS TRUMP RE­SPONDED TO QANON?</p>
    <p>Mr Trump is the cen­tral and heroic fig­ure in QAnon’s core nar­ra­tive – the brave pa­triot who was cho­sen to save Amer­ica from the global ca­bal. As a re­sult, QAnon be­liev­ers parse Mr Trump’s words and ac­tions closely, look­ing for hid­den mean­ings. When Mr Trump says the num­ber 17, they take it as a sign that he is send­ing se­cret mes­sages to them. (Q is the 17th let­ter of the al­pha­bet.) When he wears a pink tie, they in­ter­pret it as a sign that he is free­ing traf­ficked chil­dren. (Some hospi­tals use “code pink” as a short­hand for a child ab­duc­tion in progress.) Mr Trump has never di­rectly ad­dressed QAnon, but he re­cently de­clined to de­nounce or dis­avow the move­ment when asked about his sup­port for Ms Greene, the QAnon-af­fil­i­ated con­gres­sional can­di­date. And he has shared posts from QAnon fol­low­ers dozens of times on his so­cial me­dia ac­counts.</p>
    <p>For months, QAnon fol­low­ers have also been hi­jack­ing #SaveTheChi­l­dren – which started out as a fund-rais­ing cam­paign for a le­git­i­mate anti-child-traf­fick­ing or­gan­i­sa­tion – as a re­cruit­ing tac­tic.</p>
    <p>What they’re do­ing, ba­si­cally, is us­ing false and ex­ag­ger­ated claims about child traf­fick­ing to at­tract the at­ten­tion of a new au­di­ence – in this case, wor­ried par­ents. Then, they at­tempt to steer the con­ver­sa­tion to QAnon talking points – say­ing that the rea­son chil­dren are be­ing traf­ficked, for ex­am­ple, is be­cause the global ca­bal wants to har­vest a sup­pos­edly life-ex­tend­ing chem­i­cal from their blood.</p>
    <p>This par­tic­u­lar tac­tic has been es­pe­cially prob­lem­atic for le­git­i­mate anti-traf­fick­ing groups, who have had to deal with clogged hot­lines and ram­pant mis­in­for­ma­tion as QAnon has latched on to their is­sue.</p>
