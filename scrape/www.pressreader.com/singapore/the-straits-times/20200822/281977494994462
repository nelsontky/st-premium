    <p>The United States govern­ment does not usu­ally block or cen­sor law­ful web­sites, for­eign or do­mes­tic, be­cause it sub­scribes to the idea that the In­ter­net was de­signed to be open and con­nect ev­ery­one on earth.</p>
    <p>On its face, then, US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s re­cent treat­ment of the Chi­nese apps TikTok and WeChat, which he threat­ened to ban from the US un­less they could find Amer­i­can buy­ers, looks close-minded and bel­liger­ent.</p>
    <p>There is more to this sit­u­a­tion, though, than meets the eye. Were al­most any coun­try other than China in­volved, Mr Trump’s de­mands would be in­de­fen­si­ble. But the threat­ened bans on TikTok and WeChat, what­ever their mo­ti­va­tions, can also be seen as an over­due re­sponse, a tit for tat, in a long bat­tle for the soul of the In­ter­net.</p>
    <p>In China, the for­eign equiv­a­lents of TikTok and WeChat – video and mes­sag­ing apps such as YouTube and What­sApp – have been banned for years. The coun­try’s ex­ten­sive block­ing, cen­sor­ship and sur­veil­lance vi­o­late just about ev­ery prin­ci­ple of In­ter­net open­ness and de­cency. China keeps a closed and cen­so­rial In­ter­net econ­omy at home, while its prod­ucts en­joy full ac­cess to open mar­kets abroad.</p>
    <p>The asym­me­try is un­fair and ought no longer to be tol­er­ated. The priv­i­lege of full In­ter­net ac­cess – the open In­ter­net – should be ex­tended only to com­pa­nies from coun­tries that re­spect that open­ness them­selves.</p>
    <p>Be­hind the TikTok con­tro­versy is an im­por­tant strug­gle be­tween two du­elling vi­sions of the In­ter­net.</p>
    <p>The first is an older vi­sion: the idea that the In­ter­net should, in a neu­tral fash­ion, con­nect ev­ery­one, and that block­ing and cen­sor­ship of sites by na­tion states should be rare and jus­ti­fied by more than the will of the ruler.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond and newer vi­sion, of which China has been the lead­ing ex­po­nent, is “net na­tion­al­ism”, which views the coun­try’s In­ter­net pri­mar­ily as a tool of state power. Eco­nomic growth, sur­veil­lance and thought con­trol, from this per­spec­tive, are the In­ter­net’s most im­por­tant func­tions.</p>
    <p>China, in fur­ther­ance of this vi­sion, bans not only most for­eign com­peti­tors to its tech busi­nesses but also for­eign sources of news, re­li­gious in­struc­tion and other in­for­ma­tion, while us­ing the In­ter­net to pro­mote state pro­pa­ganda and en­gage in for­eign elec­toral in­ter­fer­ence. Though China is the pioneer of net na­tion­al­ism, it is on the rise else­where, par­tic­u­larly in na­tions like Saudi Ara­bia and Iran and, more re­cently, Turkey and In­dia.</p>
    <p>For many years, labour­ing un­der the vain ex­pec­ta­tion that China, suc­cumb­ing to in­ex­orable world-his­tor­i­cal forces, would be­come more like us, West­ern democ­ra­cies have al­lowed China to ex­ploit this sit­u­a­tion. We have ac­cepted, with only muted com­plaints, Chi­nese cen­sor­ship and block­ing of con­tent from abroad while al­low­ing Chi­nese com­pa­nies to ex­plore and ex­ploit what­ever mar­kets it likes. Few for­eign com­pa­nies are al­lowed to reach Chi­nese ci­ti­zens with ideas or ser­vices, but the world is fully open to China’s on­line com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>From China’s per­spec­tive, the asym­me­try has been a bo­nanza that has served eco­nomic as well as po­lit­i­cal goals. While China does have great en­gi­neers, Euro­pean na­tions over­run by Amer­i­can tech com­pa­nies must be jeal­ous of the thriv­ing tech in­dus­try that China has built in the ab­sence of se­ri­ous for­eign com­pe­ti­tion (aided by the theft of trade se­crets). At the same time, China has man­aged, to an ex­tent many be­lieved im­pos­si­ble, to use the In­ter­net to sup­press any nascent po­lit­i­cal op­po­si­tion and cease­lessly pro­mote its rul­ing party. The ide­al­ists who thought the In­ter­net would au­to­mat­i­cally cre­ate democ­racy in China were wrong.</p>
    <p>Some think that it is a tragic mis­take for the US to vi­o­late the prin­ci­ples of In­ter­net open­ness that were pi­o­neered in this coun­try. But there is also such a thing as be­ing a sucker. If China re­fuses to fol­low the rules of the open In­ter­net, why con­tinue to give it ac­cess to In­ter­net mar­kets around the world?</p>
    <p>None of this is to claim that when it comes to In­ter­net sur­veil­lance, the US govern­ment or Amer­i­can tech firms are free from sin. Nor is it to de­fend the bel­li­cose and uni­lat­eral man­ner in which Mr Trump has han­dled TikTok and WeChat. He is the wrong fig­ure to be fight­ing this fight, par­tic­u­larly be­cause his in­cli­na­tions are sus­pect. One imag­ines he might pre­fer an Amer­i­can In­ter­net de­signed to serve his pro­pa­ganda needs. A bet­ter ap­proach would be for more of the world to iso­late China in con­cert.</p>
    <p>But Mr Trump’s provo­ca­tions do make one thing clear: We need to wake up to the game we are play­ing when it comes to the fu­ture of the global In­ter­net. The ide­al­ists of the 1990s and early 2000s be­lieved that build­ing a uni­ver­sal net­work, a kind of dig­i­tal cos­mopoli­tanism, would lead to world peace and har­mony. No one buys that fan­tasy any longer.</p>
    <p>But if we want de­cency and open­ness to sur­vive on the In­ter­net – surely a more at­tain­able goal – the na­tions that hold such val­ues need to be­gin fight­ing to pro­tect them. opin­ion writer for The New York Times and the au­thor, most re­cently, of</p>
