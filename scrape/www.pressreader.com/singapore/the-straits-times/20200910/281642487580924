    <p>At­tor­ney-Gen­eral (A-G) Lu­cien Wong and the deputy at­tor­neysgen­eral were not in­volved in any pros­e­cu­to­rial de­ci­sions in the case of for­mer do­mes­tic worker Parti Liyani.</p>
    <p>The At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC) said this yes­ter­day, adding: “This case was among those rou­tinely han­dled by AGC which did not re­quire the in­volve­ment of the A-G or the DAGs.”</p>
    <p>It is­sued a state­ment in re­sponse to me­dia queries on the case, which has made the head­lines since last Fri­day, when Ms Parti was ac­quit­ted by the High Court of steal­ing from Changi Air­port Group chair­man Liew Mun Leong and his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>The AGC added in its state­ment that Deputy A-G Hri Ku­mar Nair will lead the re­view into the case.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong had, for per­sonal rea­sons, al­ready re­cused him­self from the re­view of this case last Satur­day, soon af­ter the High Court judg­ment was re­leased, the AGC added.</p>
    <p>Its state­ment did not elab­o­rate on the rea­sons.</p>
    <p>But the AGC noted that some years prior to his ap­point­ment as at­tor­ney-gen­eral, Mr Wong sat on the board of direc­tors of Cap­i­ta­Land while Mr Liew was pres­i­dent and chief ex­ec­u­tive of the com­pany.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong stepped down from the board in Jan­uary 2006.</p>
    <p>He was ap­pointed at­tor­ney-gen­eral in 2017.</p>
    <p>“A-G Lu­cien Wong and Mr Liew did not have a per­sonal re­la­tion­ship, and this con­tin­ues to­day,” the state­ment added.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral com­ments on­line and on so­cial me­dia fol­low­ing Ms Parti’s ac­quit­tal had noted that Mr Wong and Mr Liew were on the Cap­i­ta­Land board at the same time.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti, 46, who worked for the Liew fam­ily from 2007 to 2016, was ac­quit­ted of theft last Fri­day in a</p>
    <p>Nei­ther A-G Lu­cien Wong nor the deputy at­tor­neys-gen­eral (DAGs) were in­volved in any pros­e­cu­to­rial de­ci­sions re­gard­ing the charges brought in PP v Parti Liyani. This case was among those rou­tinely han­dled by AGC which did not re­quire the in­volve­ment of the A-G or the DAGs.</p>
    <p>Deputy At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Hri Ku­mar Nair will lead the re­view into the case of Ms Parti Liyani, who was ac­quit­ted last Fri­day of steal­ing from Changi Air­port Group chair­man Liew Mun Leong (third from left) and his fam­ily. At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Lu­cien Wong (left) has re­cused him­self from the re­view, cit­ing per­sonal rea­sons. judg­ment that also raised ques­tions about the mo­ti­va­tion of Mr Liew and his fam­ily in lodg­ing a po­lice re­port against the maid.</p>
    <p>The AGC said on Sun­day that it was study­ing the judg­ment to as­sess what fur­ther ac­tion, if any, ought to be taken in the light of Jus­tice Chan Seng Onn’s com­ments.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan, in his 100-page judg­ment, found the trial judge’s con­vic­tion against Ms Parti to be un­safe.</p>
    <p>He cited, among other things, the im­proper mo­tive be­hind the al­le­ga­tions of some fam­ily mem­bers.</p>
    <p>He noted that “some time prior to her ter­mi­na­tion”, Ms Parti had ex­pressed un­hap­pi­ness at be­ing made to do the ad­di­tional work of clean­ing the house and of­fice of Mr Liew’s son Karl.</p>
    <p>“There is rea­son to be­lieve that the Liew fam­ily, upon re­al­is­ing her un­hap­pi­ness, took the pre-emp­tive first step to ter­mi­nate her em­ploy­ment sud­denly with­out giv­ing her suf­fi­cient time for her to pack, in the hope that Parti would not use the time to make a com­plaint to MOM,” the judge noted.</p>
    <p>When Ms Parti threat­ened to com­plain to the Man­power Min­istry (MOM) af­ter her sud­den ter­mi­na­tion, Mr Liew and his son fol­lowed up with a po­lice re­port to pre­vent her re­turn to Sin­ga­pore to make the com­plaint, said the judge.</p>
    <p>He also cited is­sues with the han­dling of the ev­i­dence by the po­lice, and the record­ing of the al­legedly stolen items.</p>
    <p>The po­lice and MOM have also said they are study­ing the judg­ment.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Home Affairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam said the au­thor­i­ties take very se­ri­ously the judge’s com­ments on the case.</p>
    <p>“Some­thing has gone wrong in the chain of events. We have to look at that, and deal with what went wrong,” he said.</p>
    <p>“In the process, we should not be de­fen­sive. It should not be a witch hunt. It’s got to be a fair process. We have to find out what hap­pened, why it hap­pened and then deal with it. And be ac­count­able,” he added, say­ing this was the best way to build trust in the sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, a mes­sage with a clip­ping of a Straits Times (ST) front page ar­ti­cle from 1986 head­lined “Re­port made against lawyer for al­leged re­moval of le­gal files” was also cir­cu­lated among some lawyers.</p>
    <p>It con­cerned a wo­man se­nior part­ner at a lead­ing law firm who was re­ported to the po­lice for al­leged wrong­ful re­moval of com­pany files. She was seen with them in a carpark with her male lawyer friend.</p>
    <p>The ST ar­ti­cle did not name the lawyers but the male lawyer is un­der­stood to be Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>The On­line Cit­i­zen said in a re­port that the case was stood down af­ter the AGC de­cided not to pur­sue the mat­ter, and that a com­plaint was made to the Law So­ci­ety but it was never re­solved pub­licly.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, a Law So­ci­ety spokesman said of the re­port: “The com­plaint was dis­missed as be­ing un­mer­i­to­ri­ous.”</p>
    <p>AT­TOR­NEY-GEN­ERAL’S CHAM­BERS</p>
    <p>NO PER­SONAL RE­LA­TION­SHIP</p>
    <p>A-G Lu­cien Wong and Mr Liew did not have a per­sonal re­la­tion­ship, and this con­tin­ues to­day.</p>
