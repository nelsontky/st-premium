    <p>Singapore’s city roads are great to drive on, with many multi-lane, one-way ar­te­rial roads. They should be turned back into pedes­trian-friendly, two-way roads that house shops and cafes, like the High Streets of the United King­dom, says ad­junct se­nior re­search fel­low Jas­pal Singh.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has brought home the ur­gency for in­no­va­tive think­ing on a na­tion­wide, trans­for­ma­tive scale.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the pan­demic is but one im­per­a­tive un­der­ly­ing this ur­gency. We are at the point where global trends and dis­rup­tions are threat­en­ing to cre­ate the mother of all per­fect storms.</p>
    <p>The great­est of these threats is global warm­ing. We must change our ways as we are min­utes from mid­night when life on earth will no longer be like it has been since hu­man civil­i­sa­tion be­gan 70,000 years ago.</p>
    <p>To its credit, Te­masek has for over a year thought­fully used its premises to gen­tly urge Sin­ga­pore­ans to help slow cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>Two sober­ing mes­sages hit you from the bill­boards flank­ing Te­masek’s en­trance at Dhoby Ghaut – first, that Singapore’s coolest month now is as warm as the hottest month in the 1970s; and sec­ond, that more than half of all land trans­port emis­sions in Singapore are from pri­vate cars and taxis.</p>
    <p>We can­not stop people from trav­el­ling as they go about their daily lives. So the chal­lenge is to bring about a sea change in the be­hav­iour of car-own­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans to em­brace pub­lic trans­port as their de­fault mode of trans­port.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, the bus sys­tem, which of­fers su­perb point-to-point con­nec­tiv­ity, and which the Govern­ment con­tin­ues to sub­sidise to the tune of mil­lions an­nu­ally since de­cid­ing some years ago to bring it on a par with Lon­don’s bus sys­tem, widely re­garded as best-in-class.</p>
    <p>When I first heard the word “in­no­va­tion” some 40 years ago, I mis­took it as fancy man­age­ment-speak for cre­ativ­ity. Sub­se­quently, I learnt it can also mean do­ing the same thing dif­fer­ently to achieve some larger ob­jec­tive, as well as do­ing something “the old way”, if it serves a new pur­pose. So it is with our road de­sign and bus sys­tem.</p>
    <p>A WORLD-CLASS BUS SYS­TEM</p>
    <p>I was for­tu­nate to be in­volved with the Lon­don Bus sys­tem for many years when I went there in 2004 to look af­ter Com­fortDelGro’s ex­ten­sive in­vest­ments in bus, coach, taxi, pri­vate-hire and en­gi­neer­ing op­er­a­tions across the United King­dom and Ire­land, and which in­clude Lon­don’s sec­ond-largest bus op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing now re­turned home and be­ing an avid bus user – yes, the diesel’s got­ten into my blood – I can hon­estly say the Singapore bus sys­tem to­day is eas­ily the equal of that in Lon­don.</p>
    <p>More than 1,000 new buses have been added, giv­ing it the ca­pac­ity it sorely lacked to cope with peak-hour de­mand and pro­vide a ser­vice as re­li­able as that in Lon­don.</p>
    <p>It may sound pro­saic but there is a fun­da­men­tal truth herein that Trans­port Min­is­ter Khaw Boon Wan, who was once health min­is­ter, must have in­tu­itively known as he went about fix­ing the bus sys­tem: Just as hos­pi­tal bed avail­abil­ity must ex­ceed peak bed re­quire­ment for any na­tional health­care sys­tem to cope with a pan­demic, so must bus avail­abil­ity ex­ceed the peak-hour ve­hi­cle re­quire­ment if a na­tional bus sys­tem is not to col­lapse.</p>
    <p>So it is not the ab­sence of a world-class, fully air-con­di­tioned bus sys­tem that de­ters car own­ers from mak­ing the switch. Per­haps it is pride. Or more likely ig­no­rance, for they may not know what is avail­able and how buses to­day can serve their needs com­fort­ably, re­li­ably and at min­i­mal cost. Moth­ers with ba­bies in prams and those who are in­firm may not know that buses can “kneel” to al­low step-less kerb­side board­ing. They also come with wheel­chair ramps and suf­fi­ciently wide doors to cater to their needs.</p>
    <p>A DRIVER’S DREAM CITY</p>
    <p>In my view, car own­ers are not drawn to buses partly be­cause our roads are a dream to drive on. Our road net­work and the roads them­selves are de­signed to let cars speed up through traf­fic. Never mind that the roads were orig­i­nally meant to pro­vide easy, con­ve­nient ac­cess to shops, leisure out­lets, ho­tels and homes on either side for people go­ing there, be it by car, taxi, bus or on foot.</p>
    <p>That’s why most main roads in the city cen­tre and ur­ban ar­eas have been turned into one-way ar­te­ri­als, with four or five lanes. There are too few pedes­trian cross­ings, for these slow down traf­fic. Just think of Or­chard Road, Robin­son Road and Shen­ton Way. We also take much pride in the traf­fic speed im­prove­ments. Based on lat­est pub­lished statis­tics, av­er­age speed on ar­te­rial roads in­creased by 16 per cent, from 25kmh to 29kmh be­tween 2004 and 2014. They’re prob­a­bly higher to­day.</p>
    <p>De­signed as high­ways, our roads are heaven on earth for car own­ers.</p>
    <p>The road net­work is not de­signed to en­cour­age bus us­age. I should know, for when I was in the Min­istry of Trans­port, I was party to the re­moval of a few bus lanes that were thought to be “un­der-utilised” and thus re­leased to im­prove traf­fic flow.</p>
    <p>A fun­da­men­tal truth that dawned on me in the UK is that bus lanes are the bus equiv­a­lent of rail­way tracks for trains.</p>
    <p>I have never heard any­one com­plain that rail­way tracks are un­der-utilised be­cause you do not see trains stacked up bumper to bumper. Which also ex­plains why bus lanes on some roads in cen­tral Lon­don, like Maryle­bone Road, are in force 24 hours a day, ev­ery day of the year.</p>
    <p>While in­ner-city high­ways make for dream driv­ing, the real prob­lem is their be­ing one-way. This sub­con­sciously sup­presses any in­tu­itive in­cli­na­tion a car owner might have to use the bus.</p>
    <p>Let me ex­plain.</p>
    <p>If you are a car owner liv­ing in a hous­ing estate or a sub­ur­ban area, say, Hol­land Vil­lage, and want to go shop­ping at, say, Shaw Cen­tre, you may know how to get a di­rect bus there. But be­cause Or­chard Road is one-way, would you know how to get the bus back – where to get the bus on Or­chard Boule­vard to get home? And this is be­fore you pic­ture your­self, laden with shop­ping, tak­ing a long walk and hur­riedly cross­ing five lanes of Or­chard Road and Or­chard Boule­vard to get to the bus stop.</p>
    <p>Not sur­pris­ing then if car own­ers ban­ish any thought of tak­ing the bus at that point and take the car, brav­ing traf­fic and high park­ing charges.</p>
    <p>If, how­ever, Or­chard Road were two-way, you would in­tu­itively know that all you need to do is cross the street to the bus stop op­po­site and hop onto the same bus that took you there. And imag­ine if you were con­fi­dent you would not have to wait long, plus you will get a seat, es­pe­cially dur­ing off-peak hours.</p>
    <p>Ask your­self, if this in­tu­itive sense of a con­ve­nient, re­li­able, cheap and com­fort­able al­ter­na­tive is front-of-mind, would you not be much more will­ing to leave your car at home and take the bus?</p>
    <p>An­other in­ad­ver­tent and sad out­come of our pur­suit of one-way roads is that it has made high­ways out of what would oth­er­wise be “High Streets”, com­mon in the UK and Europe, that is, two-way streets with shops, restau­rants and chic street­side cafe­te­rias on either side, for easy ac­cess by people ar­riv­ing there by bus, MRT, car, bi­cy­cle or on foot.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans who have visited Lon­don will know the vi­brant</p>
    <p>“High Street” shop­ping ex­pe­ri­ence that Ox­ford Street, Re­gent Street and Pic­cadilly of­fer.</p>
    <p>All of these are two-way streets, with two, maybe three lanes in each di­rec­tion, and buses ply­ing on bus lanes in both di­rec­tions. In fact, Ox­ford Street, iconic for shop­ping, is “buses and taxis only” for much of its length, much to the de­light of shop­pers and mer­chants.</p>
    <p>A SO­LU­TION FOR OR­CHARD ROAD?</p>
    <p>The Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity (URA) and the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) are now study­ing how to re­vi­talise Or­chard Road into a world-class “High Street”, like Ox­ford Street in Lon­don. Many good sug­ges­tions have been raised, like con­fin­ing it to pub­lic trans­port or pedes­tri­an­is­ing it.</p>
    <p>I hope the URA and STB will con­sider mak­ing it a two-way “High Street” as the first step to­wards a more pro­gres­sive so­lu­tion, like con­fin­ing it fully or par­tially to pub­lic trans­port. But I would think long and hard about pedes­tri­an­is­ing it, for that could be a step too far, es­pe­cially in our weather – re­mem­ber, our coolest month to­day is as warm as the hottest month in the 1970s. You don’t want to risk shop­pers and other leisure-seek­ers tak­ing their cus­tom else­where.</p>
    <p>What­ever de­ci­sion is fi­nally taken on the future of Or­chard Road, we can rest as­sured it would be the right one, based on de­tailed traf­fic mod­el­ling stud­ies and ex­ten­sive con­sul­ta­tion with all stake­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Or­chard Road should be the start and not the end of a “High­ways to High Streets” ini­tia­tive to trans­form parts of our city-state to their orig­i­nal in­tent, as pleas­ant places for people to reach safely and eas­ily to re­lax and en­joy.</p>
    <p>Or­chard Boule­vard is an­other ex­cit­ing can­di­date for this ini­tia­tive. Made two-way and nar­rowed, it could be­come a boule­vard more than just in name, with plenty of shady, kerb­side park­ing spa­ces for the con­ve­nience of those who need, or feel the need, to drive to the Or­chard Road area, and make gen­er­ous con­tri­bu­tions to state cof­fers in park­ing fees for the priv­i­lege.</p>
    <p>Would con­ges­tion be an is­sue if Or­chard Road is made two-way and Or­chard Boule­vard nar­rowed?</p>
    <p>Maybe, but I doubt it, for an­other fun­da­men­tal truth in trans­porta­tion is that con­ges­tion is self-lim­it­ing, as mo­torists tend to find their way around it – se­niors like me will re­mem­ber when con­ges­tion pric­ing was first in­tro­duced in 1975, con­ges­tion fled from the Re­stricted Zone as mo­torists shifted to ring roads and ad­justed their driv­ing pat­terns.</p>
    <p>The idea of turn­ing in­ner-city “High­ways to High Streets” did not come to me as an epiphany. Rather, I saw a sim­i­lar trans­for­ma­tion in Lon­don, where, for the long­est time, Baker Street and Glouces­ter Place were a one-way pair, each four or five lanes wide and sep­a­rated by 90m or so.</p>
    <p>Last year, both were con­verted to two-way streets. And what a dif­fer­ence this has made. Both sides of Baker Street are now con­ve­niently ac­ces­si­ble by bus, which still en­joy the ben­e­fit of a bus lane in each di­rec­tion. Baker Street is now proudly a “High Street”, sim­i­lar to Ox­ford Street.</p>
    <p>But this was not the first trans­for­ma­tion of its kind. A few years ear­lier, Pall Mall (in St James’) was sim­i­larly con­verted to two-way. Even as an oc­ca­sional mo­torist, I was heart­ened by that move as it has im­proved traf­fic cir­cu­la­tion in the area.</p>
    <p>To be clear, I am not sug­gest­ing that our plan­ners erred in the past mak­ing our streets wider, one-way and freer-flow­ing. They were merely serv­ing past im­per­a­tives, like the need to re­duce con­ges­tion and travel times, en­abling more wide­spread car own­er­ship and de­liv­er­ing value for the costly priv­i­lege of car own­er­ship.</p>
    <p>Times have changed and new im­per­a­tives have arisen, like the need to re­ju­ve­nate road­side shop­ping and en­ter­tain­ment, and do­ing our bit to save the planet by mak­ing roads more bus-friendly to nudge people to take pub­lic trans­port.</p>
    <p>Also, Singapore fi­nally has a world-class pub­lic trans­port sys­tem, both bus and rail. As a na­tion, we need to re­spond in­no­va­tively in our be­hav­iour and do jus­tice to our ac­com­plish­ments.</p>
    <p>There is noth­ing wrong with restor­ing “high­ways” that were once “High Streets” back to their former role, and us­ing buses even if we can now af­ford to own a car.</p>
    <p>I be­lieve our skies will turn bluer again, and bring us closer as we en­joy one an­other’s com­pany in the bus.</p>
    <p>For I re­call the late Mr Sim Kee Boon, my first boss in the civil ser­vice, who taught me an­other fun­da­men­tal truth a long time ago: “There are no new ideas in the Mid­dle King­dom; the trick lies in iden­ti­fy­ing an idea whose time has come.”</p>
    <p>He was prob­a­bly quot­ing an­cient Chi­nese rulers, but I think it ap­plies equally to mod­ern Singapore.</p>
