    <p>For Malta, is­su­ing pass­ports has be­come a gold mine. The small is­land in the Mediter­ranean raked in be­tween €1 bil­lion (S$1.6 bil­lion) and €1.5 bil­lion over the past six years by sell­ing Mal­tese cit­i­zen­ship to those who would have it.</p>
    <p>While the 500,000-res­i­dent is­land may not be the most at­trac­tive place to spend the rest of your life, bear­ing a Mal­tese pass­port might be worth it. Mal­tese ci­ti­zens en­joy the nu­mer­ous ad­van­tages of be­long­ing to the Euro­pean Union like visa-free travel in the Schen­gen Area, free­dom of move­ment, and per­mis­sion to work in any of the 27 member states of the EU.</p>
    <p>How­ever, this busi­ness model might come to an end sooner rather than later, as the Euro­pean Court of Jus­tice is on the watch, ready to file a law­suit against coun­tries that sell cit­i­zen­ship for cash.</p>
    <p>EU Com­mis­sioner for Jus­tice Di­dier Reyn­ders re­cently stated that the so-called golden pass­port sys­tem “un­der­mines the essence of EU cit­i­zen­ship”. “Euro­pean val­ues are not for sale,” he said.</p>
    <p>Con­cerns have arisen that a golden pass­port opens the door to money laun­der­ing, tax eva­sion and corruption. In a ple­nary de­bate, del­e­gates of the EU Par­lia­ment in­sisted that Europe must not have “a fast-track en­trance for crim­i­nals”.</p>
    <p>But it is not only Malta that angers the EU com­mis­sioner.</p>
    <p>Cyprus, also l ocated i n the Mediter­ranean sea, has cre­ated a prof­itable busi­ness of sell­ing its pass­ports as well. Around a year ago, Cyprus made head­lines when it be­came known that fugi­tive busi­ness­man Low Taek Jho had a Cypriot pass­port that al­lowed him to evade the Malaysian po­lice.</p>
    <p>Low is the key fig­ure in the 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had scan­dal of 2015, in which he al­legedly helped siphon bil­lions of dol­lars from the state fund into pri­vate ac­counts.</p>
    <p>In Malta, the pre­con­di­tions for be­com­ing a Mal­tese ci­ti­zen are clearly set: The in­ter­ested party has to ac­quire real es­tate worth be­tween €600,000 and €750,00, make an ad­di­tional do­na­tion of €10,000 to a reg­is­tered non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion, and take le­gal res­i­dence in Malta for at least 12 months. Once the re­quire­ments are met, an ap­pli­ca­tion for cit­i­zen­ship can be filed.</p>
    <p>With a min­i­mum in­vest­ment of €2.5 mil­lion, be­com­ing a Cypriot is some­what more ex­pen­sive than ac­quir­ing the Mal­tese cit­i­zen­ship. How­ever, Cyprus came into the cross hairs last au­tumn af­ter re­porters of Arab news chan­nel Al Jazeera found that even the high­est ech­e­lons of pol­i­tics, in­clud­ing the Speaker of Par­lia­ment, had been in­volved in the scheme. In ex­change for ex­tra pay­ments, pass­ports were given to well-known crim­i­nals.</p>
    <p>Al­though Cyprus an­nounced af­ter the rev­e­la­tions that it would dis­con­tinue its pro­gramme in its present form, it did not say whether the coun­try will com­pletely stop the sale of pass­ports.</p>
    <p>More re­cently, Brexit and Covid-19 have led to an in­crease in re­quests from for­eign ci­ti­zens. The pan­demic in par­tic­u­lar, and the prospect of hav­ing ac­cess to rather well-func­tion­ing Euro­pean health­care sys­tems, worked as a mag­net. Some Euro­pean coun­tries have started of­fer­ing golden visas.</p>
    <p>Por­tu­gal, Greece and Spain are putting up for sale per­mits of res­i­dence in ex­change for in­vest­ments. Spain launched its golden visa pro­gramme in 2013. By buy­ing real es­tate worth €500,000, a fam­ily ob­tains the per­mis­sion to stay tem­po­rar­ily in Spain. The visa can be re­newed every two years. Af­ter five years, per­ma­nent res­i­dency is wait­ing and af­ter 10 years, even cit­i­zen­ship.</p>
    <p>Liv­ing in Spain is not re­quired to re­tain and re­new the res­i­dency visa per­mit.</p>
    <p>Es­ti­mates for the pro­ceed­ings from sell­ing golden visas range from €5.5 bil­lion since 2012 in the case of Por­tu­gal and €7 bil­lion for Cyprus since 2013.</p>
    <p>Mr Sven Giegold, a member of the Euro­pean Par­lia­ment and the Ger­man Green Party, says: “EU pass­ports and visas are not com­modi­ties. Money must not be the cri­te­rion for cit­i­zen­ship and res­i­dence rights in the EU.” For years, he has pres­sured the EU Com­mis­sion to crack down on the ben­e­fi­cia­ries of the pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics like Mr Giegold do not buy into the ar­gu­ment that sell­ing cit­i­zen­ship is a sov­er­eign de­ci­sion of a sov­er­eign state. Since a pass­port of Cyprus or Malta also gives ac­cess to ser­vices and ben­e­fits in other EU coun­tries, the mat­ter is not purely a na­tional one, they say.</p>
    <p>Even more, as a EU ci­ti­zen one is el­i­gi­ble to vote. Par­tic­i­pat­ing coun­tries “make prof­its from rights which are valid through­out Europe”, Mr Giegold re­cently stated. Call­ing the EU Com­mis­sion to ac­tion, he said on Oct 20 on his web­site: “It is now time to launch con­crete coun­ter­mea­sures.”</p>
