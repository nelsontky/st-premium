    <p>When Mr Das Dipto ar­rived for work at Block 244, Hougang Street 22 on Sun­day at 7.35am, the land­scape main­te­nance worker did not ex­pect to be in­volved in “the best job I’ve done in my life”.</p>
    <p>The 27-year-old was there to prune trees, but ended up res­cu­ing a child, be­lieved to be six years old, who was stuck on a win­dow ledge barely wide enough for his feet.</p>
    <p>Mr Dipto, who moved from Bangladesh to work here eight years ago, told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that he was clean­ing a boom lift he used for prun­ing trees when a fran­tic woman ap­proached him and his col­league – Mr Biswas Ji­bom, 19. She pointed to the boy, who was cling­ing on to laun­dry poles while on a ledge three storeys high at the neigh­bour­ing Block 243.</p>
    <p>The woman told them the door to the boy’s flat was locked, so Mr Dipto de­cided the best way to reach him was to use the boom lift – a caged plat­form at the end of a mo­bile crane. With Mr Biswas di­rect­ing him, he steered the ma­chine to­wards Block 243 and the boy, who was cry­ing.</p>
    <p>In a video shared on What­sApp and up­loaded onto Face­book, passers-by are heard shout­ing at the child to hold on, es­pe­cially af­ter he loosens his grip at one point.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Dipto is seen ma­noeu­vring the plat­form to be within reach of the stranded boy.</p>
    <p>He told ST that he spoke calmly to the boy in English and ex­plained that he was about to res­cue him.</p>
    <p>When he was close enough, he reached out with both arms and lifted the boy onto the plat­form – an act met with cheers.</p>
    <p>With one arm firmly around the child and the other con­trol­ling the boom lift, he low­ered the fright­ened boy to safety.</p>
    <p>Mr Dipto said a man then took the boy away.</p>
    <p>Re­call­ing the in­ci­dent, Mr Dipto said he was so en­grossed in sav­ing the boy that he did not no­tice a small crowd had gath­ered.</p>
    <p>The youngest of five broth­ers, Mr Dipto said his fourth brother, who like him works for land­scap­ing firm Yong Aik Con­struc­tion, shared the video with neigh­bours and friends back in their home­town of Narail in Dhaka.</p>
    <p>Mr Dipto said his mother – whom he spoke to dur­ing his daily phone call with her yes­ter­day – praised him for do­ing “a very good job” in res­cu­ing the stranded child.</p>
    <p>She was shown the video by a friend in Bangladesh.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese evening daily Lianhe Wan­bao on Mon­day re­ported that the boy had climbed out of a kitchen win­dow af­ter wak­ing up to dis­cover that he was home alone.</p>
    <p>It added that the boy was cry­ing on the ledge as he looked for his</p>

    <p>mother, and that neigh­bours who knocked on the third-floor unit’s door did not get a re­sponse.</p>
    <p>Later on Sun­day morn­ing, the boy’s mother, ac­com­pa­nied by the boy, met Mr Dipto in Hougang and thanked him.</p>
    <p>“She said, ‘Thank you, sir, you saved my son’s life,’” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Mar­cus Ang, Mr Dipto’s su­per­vi­sor, said the com­pany plans to re­ward Mr Dipto and Mr Biswas. He added that the Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force will recog­nise both work­ers’ act with an award to­day.</p>
    <p>“Dipto has been very pos­i­tive over many dif­fer­ent projects, and he has al­ways been a very hard worker,” said Mr Ang.</p>
    <p>Mr Dipto posted photos of the res­cue on his Face­book page on Mon­day night with the cap­tion: “At a work time I sav­ing one chil­dren life in Sin­ga­pore... at last my life is a good job... I pray for the God I do­ing the work prop­erly.”</p>
    <p>Many peo­ple thanked Mr Dipto in the com­ments, prais­ing him for his self­less­ness.</p>
    <p>“So thank­ful for your kind ac­tion. The kid might be in dan­ger if not for you,” wrote Face­book user Yong Yun, who called him a hero.</p>

        <p data-role="text">In the in&#xAD;ci&#xAD;dent on Sun&#xAD;day, the boy (left) was stranded on a third-storey win&#xAD;dow ledge at Block 243 in Hougang Street 22. Mr Das Dipto, a land&#xAD;scape main&#xAD;te&#xAD;nance worker, used a boom lift with his col&#xAD;league&#x2019;s help to reach the child and bring him to safety. Mr Dipto won praise for his act af&#xAD;ter a video of the res&#xAD;cue cir&#xAD;cu&#xAD;lated on so&#xAD;cial media.</p>
