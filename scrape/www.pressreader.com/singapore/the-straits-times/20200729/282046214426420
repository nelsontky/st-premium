    <p>As a vol­un­teer in charge of man­ag­ing peo­ple placed on stay-home no­tice (SHN) on re­turn­ing from over­seas, Ms Grace Koh worked long hours and on public hol­i­days in the past few months to en­sure they are re­ceived prop­erly at des­ig­nated ho­tels.</p>
    <p>But what turned out to be more chal­leng­ing was man­ag­ing the emo­tions of their anxious fam­ily mem­bers, said the se­nior man­ager (Skyrise Green­ery) at the Na­tional Parks Board yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>She re­called a dis­traught mother who missed the op­por­tu­nity to see her daugh­ter be­fore she checked into the ho­tel. The girl, who is in her early teens, had re­turned to Sin­ga­pore un­ac­com­pa­nied. “You just feel help­less be­cause there’s re­ally noth­ing you can do, as the mother had missed the mo­ment when she could have seen her daugh­ter alight from the bus that took her from the air­port to the ho­tel.</p>
    <p>“All I could do was lend an ear and re­as­sure her,” she re­counted.</p>
    <p>Ms Koh, 32, one of the many “un­sung he­roes” who have con­trib­uted to Sin­ga­pore’s fight against Covid-19, will be among guests in­vited to the Na­tional Day cer­e­mony at Kam­pung Ad­mi­ralty on Aug 9. The in­te­grated re­tire­ment com­mu­nity devel­op­ment is one of seven lo­ca­tions – be­sides a scaled-down pa­rade at the Padang – where minicer­e­monies will be held for this year’s Na­tional Day Pa­rade (NDP).</p>
    <p>An­other guest, Ms Maslin­dah Fadzi­lah, 40, has been help­ing to man­age a gov­ern­ment quar­an­tine fa­cil­ity since April.</p>
    <p>The hos­pi­tal­ity man­ager at Insead Res­i­dences in one-north over­sees the quar­an­tine oper­a­tions there, in­clud­ing mak­ing sure those quar­an­tined can con­tact their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>She said every Na­tional Day, she feels proud to be a Sin­ga­porean. Her fam­ily, too, is ex­cited, she added. “Every week­end, when the fighter jets are do­ing their re­hearsals, my nine-year-old son will run ex­cit­edly to the win­dow.”</p>
