    <p>Go big or go home has al­ways been busi­ness­man Bernard Oh’s mantra.</p>
    <p>From par­lay­ing a business in 1995 with just $3,000 in sav­ings into a $60-mil­lion ex­pe­ri­en­tial mar­ket­ing agency with six overseas branches by 2015 called amc asia! (The Au­di­ence Mo­ti­va­tion Com­pany Asia), Mr Oh has bur­nished his cre­den­tials be­ing a diehard glass-half-full man.</p>
    <p>Ever hun­gry for big­ger chal­lenges, the en­tre­pre­neur is now transformi­ng the outer wall can­vas of his of­fice build­ing in Jalan Klapa in Kam­pong Glam into one of the big­gest mu­rals in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Ti­tled I Want To Go There, it is a col­lab­o­ra­tive project with lo­cal cre­ative tal­ents to add buzz to the Kam­pong Glam her­itage en­clave.</p>
    <p>“Larger-than-life wall mu­rals like these blur the line be­tween art and his­tory,” says Mr Oh, 54, who tog­gles be­tween over­see­ing his busi­nesses in Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Shang­hai, Bei­jing, Seoul and Abu Dhabi and work­ing to kick-start con­ver­sa­tions about rein­vent­ing her­itage and cul­ture.</p>
    <p>“Out­door art spurs a viewer to think about how these vis­ual mes­sages in­ter­act with the space and the cul­tural make-up of the precinct, string­ing a time­line that evokes el­e­ments of past, present and fu­ture, cap­tured in a vi­brant mix of colours on the wall,” he says.</p>
    <p>One of his first brushes with street art was with Ernest Zachare­vic in 2013 when he com­mis­sioned the Pe­nang-based world-fa­mous street artist to cre­ate a mu­ral for amc asia!’s 18th an­niver­sary along Jalan Klapa. The mu­ral de­picts chil­dren play­ing in su­per­mar­ket carts, with an ac­tual trol­ley at­tached to the wall for passers-by to grab on to.</p>
    <p>He had heard of how the Lithua­nian artist, a first-class hon­ours grad­u­ate in fine art from Mid­dle­sex Univer­sity in London, had cre­ated whim­si­cal street art for the Ge­orge Town Fes­ti­val in Pe­nang, Malaysia, in 2012, which had be­come ma­jor tourist at­trac­tions.</p>
    <p>Wall mu­rals and street art are in­creas­ingly be­com­ing “place­mak­ing” fea­tures in mod­ern cities around the world, help­ing to cre­ate not only an iden­tity in a cer­tain walk­way or en­clave, but also im­bu­ing it with soul and char­ac­ter.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the trol­ley piece by Zachare­vic is not just an In­sta­gram photo op­por­tu­nity, but also a com­mu­nity out­reach in­stal­la­tion, serv­ing as a free pub­lic pantry where gro­ceries can be placed for those who need it and en­cour­ag­ing the com­mu­nity around the mu­ral to “take what you need, give what you can”.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Author­ity (URA), mu­rals are al­lowed on end gable walls of shop­houses, but the works must be ap­pro­pri­ate to the char­ac­ter of the area. Pro­pos­als for mu­rals must be ap­proved by both the build­ing own­ers and URA be­fore the works are car­ried out.</p>
    <p>“We wel­come pro­pos­als for mu­rals that ac­cen­tu­ate the his­tory and char­ac­ter of our con­ser­va­tion dis­tricts,” says a URA spokesman. “We have guide­lines in place for mu­rals to fa­cil­i­tate a bal­ance be­tween artistic cre­ativ­ity and en­hanc­ing the pub­lic’s ap­pre­ci­a­tion of con­ser­va­tion build­ings.</p>
    <p>“In ad­di­tion, we will con­sult lo­cal stake­holder groups when we re­ceive such pro­pos­als to en­sure that they re­late well to the re­spec­tive ar­eas and com­mu­ni­ties.”</p>
    <p>Mr Oh says: “Of­ten, peo­ple get con­fused about the graf­fiti, street art and mu­rals. Wall mu­rals are not just about rep­re­sen­ta­tion, her­itage or art for art’s sake. These works at­tempt to hu­man­ise a space.”</p>
    <p>From last month to De­cem­ber, five sec­tions of the build­ing wall in Jalan Klapa will serve as a con­crete can­vas for 21 artists com­pris­ing in­di­vid­u­als, stu­dents and a group to ex­press their in­ter­pre­ta­tions of the clar­ion call, I Want To Go There.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the mu­ral, there will also be dig­i­tal place­mak­ing in the form of aug­mented-re­al­ity in­ter­ac­tions</p>
    <p>to un­lock the rich cul­ture and her­itage of Kam­pong Glam.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal stick­ers and fil­ters as well as a mi­crosite ac­ces­si­ble through QR code de­vices will be placed on the walls of amc asia!’s build­ing to add to the over­all ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>An artist in the mu­ral project is Toby­ato, a 26-year-old free­lancer who, like most mu­ral and street artists, prefers to be known by a moniker.</p>
    <p>He hopes that in 10 years, more street art projects will help el­e­vate the arts in Sin­ga­pore as a whole. “I think street art is one of the best ways, if not the best, for art to be ac­ces­si­ble to the pub­lic. Art in pub­lic spa­ces is en­joyed in­stinc­tively, it is out there for ev­ery­one and any­one to en­joy or cri­tique.”</p>
    <p>Artist Rai­hana Ab­dul Rah­man or araikreva, 37, who rep­re­sents art col­lec­tive DPLMT, agrees.</p>
    <p>“There is a charm when a neigh­bour­hood has a vis­ual story,” says the free­lance art di­rec­tor, who is part of a group of six artists work­ing on a sec­tion of the mu­ral. Their piece is in­spired by a tra­di­tional Malay dance to ap­pease guardian sea spir­its called Ulek Mayang. “Be­sides the com­mon rea­son to give cre­atives a plat­form to ex­press them­selves, the dif­fer­ence be­tween a place and a home is its peo­ple. For peo­ple who grew up, worked there and passed by these ar­eas, these sto­ries make street art spe­cial.”</p>
    <p>School of Art, De­sign and Me­dia stu­dent Lee Jia Zhen says street art has the abil­ity to bring peo­ple to­gether. “These blank spa­ces would be can­vases for artists to­day to be­gin con­ver­sa­tions and also help add to the vi­brancy of our art iden­tity,” says the 23-year-old. “See­ing more con­tem­po­rary art fill our streets ex­cites me, and makes me want to cre­ate as I feel en­cour­aged that there is still space for cre­ative ex­pres­sion.”</p>
