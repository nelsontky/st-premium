    <p>So many stay­cays, so lit­tle time. What makes this ho­tel spe­cial? The An­daz chain is the younger, hip­per off­shoot of the Hy­att and the name is Hindi for “per­sonal style”. There’s lots of it in the Sin­ga­pore prop­erty.</p>
    <p>The ser­vice is friendly but also at­ten­tive. Staff do more than pay lip ser­vice to, well, ser­vice. They start con­ver­sa­tions and ask af­ter guests like they mean it.</p>
    <p>I get great wine rec­om­men­da­tions from a staff mem­ber at dinner. And I can­not help but ad­mire the funky sneak­ers on an­other as he set­tles me down in the Sun­room af­ter break­fast. Per­sonal style in spades.</p>
    <p>My deluxe room, with a king-size bed, has a won­der­ful view of the Sin­ga­pore sky­line and the bay – too bad the sky is over­cast dur­ing my stay. It is a stylish room, beau­ti­fully lit.</p>
    <p>You could be in any smart city in any part of the world. But there are touches of Sin­ga­pore that make per­fect sense.</p>
    <p>The toi­letries, by French per­fumer Christophe Lau­damiel, is called Sin­ga­pore Fu­sion #19. Orchid, jas­mine, clove, gin­ger and Chi­nese cedar­wood are just some of the scents that re­mind you, in fra­grant fash­ion, where you are.</p>
    <p>I can’t help but smile when I see that in­stead of the usual bed­room slip­pers, guests get flip-flops. So Sin­ga­porean.</p>
    <p>And then I peer more closely at them. “Stolen from An­daz Sin­ga­pore.” Go on, I dare you to.</p>
    <p>You had drinks in a what?</p>
    <p>Teepee. Mr Stork, the ho­tel’s rooftop bar, has 10 teepees dot­ted around green­ery. When you book your stay­ca­tion, make sure to re­serve one. They are pop­u­lar.</p>
    <p>I re­cline in my teepee and re­lax, the cares of the world and work slip­ping away as the sun sets. Dress cool, my friends who’ve been to the al­fresco bar tell me. You might want to do that, but I feel per­fectly com­fort­able.</p>
    <p>The two cock­tails I have over the two hours I spend there are right up my al­ley. Grape­fruit ($22) is zippy with fresh grape­fruit juice, lime juice, bit­ters and tequila. Even bet­ter is Rhubarb ($22), with rhubarb syrup, straw­berry liqueur, lemon juice, sparkling wine and vodka.</p>
    <p>For nib­bles, I go Mid­dle East­ern, with Baba Ganoush ($18), smoky and served with warm pita bread; and Grilled Squid ($20), with spicy, aro­matic cher­moula sauce.</p>
    <p>And there’s room for dinner?</p>
    <p>Yes in­deed. My dinner reser­va­tion at 665°F, the ho­tel’s steak­house, isn’t un­til 8.30pm. That’s how pop­u­lar it is.</p>
    <p>So there is plenty of time af­ter drinks to go back to my room, ad­mire the night view and get changed for dinner.</p>
    <p>Be­fore check­ing in, I look at the menu on­line and have an idea of what I want to or­der. All that flies out the win­dow when I see the Chef’s Tast­ing Menu – a six-course meal for $110, with good in­gre­di­ents.</p>
    <p>The amuse bouche is crab cakes, and the other cour­ses are just as indulgent – Hokkaido scal­lops with cau­li­flower puree, pan-seared foie gras and a lux­u­ri­ous lob­ster bisque.</p>
    <p>For the main, there is a choice be­tween A4 Kagoshima striploin and Atlantic cod. I go with beef and am not dis­ap­pointed. There is a fierce sear on the out­side and it is per­fectly medium-rare inside. Creamed spinach, with a hint of nut­meg, is an ex­cel­lent ac­com­pa­ni­ment.</p>
    <p>Dessert is mille-feuille lay­ered with salted but­ter caramel. It shat­ters like the thinnest glass.</p>
    <p>I ask ex­ec­u­tive sous chef Raj Kumar how he makes the num­bers work and he tells me he can of­fer that very good price be­cause of economies of scale.</p>
    <p>“We have to come here,” I tell my friends in a text mes­sage.</p>
    <p>It is worth not­ing that the restau­rant serves al­co­hol-free wines from Pierre Chavin. To go with my dinner, I have Back­story Caber­net Sau­vi­gnon 2018 from Cal­i­for­nia ($20 a glass), with a de­li­cious red fruit vibe.</p>
    <p>Verdict: Yay or nay?</p>
    <p>Af­ter check­ing in, I check out the ho­tel. It is just af­ter 3pm and guests are lin­ger­ing over lunch or read­ing</p>
    <p>and work­ing in the Sun­room.</p>
    <p>I find out some stay for days. I would too, if I could. That would be an en­thu­si­as­tic yay.</p>
    <p>Hot Tip</p>
    <p>The ho­tel has tie-ups with busi­nesses nearby to of­fer dis­counts on hair ser­vices, shop­ping, spa treat­ments and food. I feel so at home in the ho­tel and can­not bring my­self to ven­ture out.</p>
    <p>Be­sides, I get to make my own perfume.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore fra­grance com­pany Oo La Lab lets people get cre­ative with its Oo La Lab Perfume Mixol­ogy Brief­case. In the smart plas­tic case is a se­lec­tion of 12 eau de par­fum, nine empty vials and all the ac­cou­trements to mix and match scents. For guests of the ho­tel, the price is $258 in­stead of the usual price of $388.</p>
    <p>I spend a cou­ple of happy hours mix­ing and match­ing and wear my creations to drinks, and then to dinner.</p>
    <p>This stay­ca­tion was hosted by the ho­tel and is part of a weekly se­ries. For more stay­ca­tion re­views, go to str.sg/SuiteLife.</p>
