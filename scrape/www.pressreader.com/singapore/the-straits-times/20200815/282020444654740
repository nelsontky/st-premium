    <p>Un­set­tled by news that the fam­ily of a vic­tim in a per­sonal mo­bil­ity de­vice ac­ci­dent could go with­out any com­pen­sa­tion in the near fu­ture, one 13-year-old de­cided to act.</p>
    <p>Grade 7 stu­dent Sophia Chiam came across The Straits Times ar­ti­cle about Madam Ang Liu Kiow’s plight on July 26, and with the help of her mother, Dr Lisa Chen, the pair launched a fund-rais­ing cam­paign for Madam Ang yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“When I first read Madam Ang’s story, some­thing stirred within me and I wanted to help,” said Sophia, a St Joseph’s In­sti­tu­tion (In­ter­na­tional) stu­dent.</p>
    <p>Madam Ang, 57, was left with brain dam­age after be­ing hit by an e-scooter in 2016, and needs help to carry out ac­tiv­i­ties of daily liv­ing. She also suf­fers from com­mu­ni­ca­tion im­pair­ment.</p>
    <p>The court last month or­dered es­cooter rider Ni­cholas Ting Nai Jie, 21, to pay $445,000 to Madam Ang after her hus­band, Mr Leong Loon Wah, sued him on her be­half. How­ever, Mr Ting said through his lawyer that he will not be able to pay the sum as he has no as­sets and was not cov­ered by in­sur­ance.</p>
    <p>After ST re­ported this, sev­eral con­cerned read­ers – Sophia and her mother in­cluded – wrote in of­fer­ing to help Mr Leong.</p>
    <p>Sophia and Dr Chen, 48, set up a crowd­fund­ing cam­paign on Give.asia, aim­ing to raise $445,000.</p>
    <p>Dr Chen said she was touched that her daugh­ter wanted to help a com­plete stranger. They con­sulted the Leong fam­ily over a video call last week to get ap­proval to help them raise funds, and to see how to best ad­dress their needs.</p>
    <p>“Mr Leong was con­cerned that oth­ers were po­ten­tially in dis­tress them­selves dur­ing this Covid-19 sea­son and ex­pressed his grat­i­tude for the kind­ness and gen­eros­ity he had al­ready re­ceived,” said Dr Chen, a gen­eral prac­ti­tioner.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily is rais­ing aware­ness by word of mouth and through so­cial me­dia, and pub­li­cis­ing the crowd­fund­ing cam­paign at the clin­ics un­der the Min­med Group as well as eater­ies owned by Dr Chen and her hus­band, Dr Eric Chiam. These eater­ies are Saveur, Fra­pasBar, Medi­umRare and Bread & But­ter­fly.</p>
    <p>In the 2016 ac­ci­dent, Madam Ang was hit by an elec­tric scooter along a foot­path in Pasir Ris. She hit her head on the ground when she fell, and later un­der­went emer­gency surgery for bleed­ing in her brain.</p>
    <p>She is now un­able to speak, read or write, and needs help with eat­ing, dress­ing and us­ing the bath­room.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong, 57, is a con­tract worker mak­ing $2,000 to $3,000 a month. He said he has spent more than $60,000 on med­i­cal bills and care for his wife, and the cost is ris­ing.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily has had to hire a helper, and doc­tors do not ex­pect Madam Ang to re­cover fur­ther from her dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Speaking through his l awyer Bene­dict Teo from Drew & Napier, who is act­ing on a pro bono ba­sis, Mr Leong re­it­er­ated that he ap­pre­ci­ates all the help ren­dered, es­pe­cially from Dr Chen and her fam­ily.</p>
    <p>He added: “I am very grate­ful for any dol­lar re­ceived, es­pe­cially given (the) pre­vail­ing eco­nomic cli­mate (that) makes life tough for ev­ery­one.”</p>
