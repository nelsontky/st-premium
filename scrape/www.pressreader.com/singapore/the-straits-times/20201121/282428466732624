    <p>CIMB Sin­ga­pore has laid off three of its bank­ing unit heads as the lender re­struc­tures its busi­ness in an ef­fort to cope with the im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The lo­cal unit of the Malaysian bank has cut its con­sumer bank­ing head Josandi Thor, com­mer­cial bank­ing head Yong Ji­unn Run and cor­po­rate bank­ing head Lai VenLi. They will leave on Nov 30, ac­cord­ing to fi­nan­cial ser­vices ca­reer web­site eFi­nan­cial­Ca­reers.</p>
    <p>CIMB Sin­ga­pore chief ex­ec­u­tive Vic­tor Lee sent an in­ter­nal memo to staff on Tues­day in­form­ing them of the lay­offs, re­ported eFi­nan­cial­Ca­reers. “This un­prece­dented pan­demic has se­verely af­fected the econ­omy and our busi­ness, forc­ing us to take a hard look at our busi­ness model and di­rec­tion,” he wrote in the memo.</p>
    <p>CIMB Sin­ga­pore posted losses of RM939 mil­lion (S$308.2 mil­lion) in the first half of this year due to im­pair­ments, weigh­ing on the group’s per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to CIMB’s growth plan, Mr Lee said the bank has con­ducted a de­tailed anal­y­sis of its Sin­ga­pore busi­ness and re­cal­i­brated its For­ward23+ strat­egy to have greater em­pha­sis on sus­tain­able growth.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, it will re­shape busi­ness port­fo­lios, drive cost ef­fi­ciency, stream­line its lead­er­ship struc­ture and al­low its chief ex­ec­u­tive to fo­cus on key ar­eas im­pact­ing the busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said that let­ting go of Ms Thor, Mr Yong and Ms Lai was a “hard de­ci­sion that group man­age­ment had to make af­ter look­ing into var­i­ous op­tions”.</p>
    <p>Ms Thor joined CIMB Sin­ga­pore in 2010, and pre­vi­ously headed mar­ket­ing for the bank here and in Malaysia, while Mr Yong has been with the bank since 2011.</p>
    <p>It is not known how long Ms Lai has been with CIMB.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said the bank will an­nounce its new Sin­ga­pore lead­er­ship team soon. A CIMB Sin­ga­pore spokesman, when con­tacted, said: “We do not com­ment on any of the bank’s in­ter­nal memos for con­fi­den­tial­ity rea­sons.”</p>
