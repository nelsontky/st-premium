    <p>As the pan­demic draws out, psy­cho­log­i­cal fa­tigue is set­ting in, re­sult­ing in more peo­ple flout­ing rules such as so­cial dis­tanc­ing – a be­havioural trend that en­cour­ages oth­ers to fol­low suit, said lo­cal ex­perts.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Leong Chan-Hoong, a psy­chol­o­gist at the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences’ Cen­tre for Ap­plied Re­search, said the i mpact of the</p>
    <p>Covid-19 pan­demic on peo­ple’s be­hav­iour can be at­trib­uted to two main schools of thought.</p>
    <p>The first group tends to be­lieve preven­ta­tive mea­sures like the cir­cuit breaker are key in mit­i­gat­ing the spread of the dis­ease, while the sec­ond group is more scep­ti­cal, es­pe­cially as the strate­gies re­sult in eco­nomic fall­out, he added.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond group “tends to fol­low these rules as they are legally bind­ing, with­out in­ter­nal­is­ing the norms be­hind them. So, when psy­cho­log­i­cal fa­tigue be­gins to set in, they start to flout the rules”.</p>
    <p>“There­fore, for rules which are harder to en­force like so­cial dis­tanc­ing, peo­ple re­alise that they are un­likely to get caught and have less im­pe­tus to com­ply,” he said.</p>
    <p>And over time, those in the mid­dle of the at­ti­tude spec­trum may feel they are im­mune to the virus, and be­gin to fol­low those who flout the rules, said Prof Leong.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ol­o­gist Tan Ern Ser also noted that at beaches and malls where al­most ev­ery­one is not prac­tis­ing safe dis­tanc­ing, this could be­come an in­for­mal norm. “In fact, a per­son who does so may feel like a de­viant, (and the) odd one out.”</p>
    <p>He at­trib­uted the gen­eral sense of com­pla­cency among the pub­lic to the fact that “only 1 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion has been in­fected, and of these, the ma­jor­ity are from foreign worker dor­mi­to­ries”.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, most peo­ple feel that ev­ery­one is all right, so life can go</p>
