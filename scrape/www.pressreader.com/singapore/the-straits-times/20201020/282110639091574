    <p>In the 1990s, Mr Umej Bha­tia hosted a cur­rent af­fairs pro­gramme on lo­cal tele­vi­sion called Talk­ing Point.</p>
    <p>He saw how Singapore was mak­ing an im­pact on the in­ter­na­tional scene, with vet­eran diplo­mats like Mr Tommy Koh play­ing a piv­otal role in ne­go­ti­a­tions on the United Na­tions Con­fer­ence on the Law of the Sea, which is to­day uni­ver­sally ac­cepted as the mod­ern law of the sea.</p>
    <p>In­spired as well by former per­ma­nent sec­re­taries Kishore Mah­bubani and Bi­la­hari Kausikan, he joined the Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs (MFA) in 1996.</p>
    <p>“They were re­ally mak­ing a dent at the global level and it in­trigued me,” Mr Bha­tia, now 50, told The Straits Times at the MFA build­ing in Sher­wood Road in Tan­glin.</p>
    <p>To­day, he over­sees Singapore’s Of­fices to the UN in Geneva and Vi­enna, in­clud­ing be­ing Per­ma­nent Rep­re­sen­ta­tive to the In­ter­na­tional Atomic En­ergy Agency.</p>
    <p>He has also been on the Mid­dle East cir­cuit and in 2001, his fam­ily was evac­u­ated from their apart­ment dur­ing the Sept 11 ter­ror­ist at­tacks in New York, where he was part of a team that rep­re­sented Singapore at its first and only term as a non-elected mem­ber of the UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>But what was most mem­o­rable for him was the pe­riod lead­ing up to the 2003 war in Iraq, when he was man­ag­ing the Iraq dossier for Singapore. He and a group of ju­nior diplo­mats drafted the UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil Res­o­lu­tion 1441, giv­ing then Iraqi President Sad­dam Hus­sein’s regime a last chance to com­ply with its dis­ar­ma­ment obli­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>“I ex­pe­ri­enced first-hand the high stakes of global war and peace in the coun­cil de­lib­er­a­tions,” he said of the tense, closed-door de­bates in the crowded coun­cil con­sul­ta­tion room then.</p>
    <p>“It was an in­valu­able les­son in real power pol­i­tics – how diplo­macy worked, and did not work.”</p>
