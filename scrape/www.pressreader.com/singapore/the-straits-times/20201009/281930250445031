    <p>With its big­gest city locked down, fac­to­ries shut, coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion rates climb­ing by some 1,000 or more ev­ery day and death toll cross­ing 500, con­di­tions in Myan­mar are look­ing grim.</p>
    <p>Yet its state coun­sel­lor and rul­ing party leader Aung San Suu Kyi says the Nov 8 elec­tion is even more im­por­tant than fight­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>One jus­ti­fi­ca­tion mak­ing the rounds is that de­lay­ing the poll could cre­ate a con­sti­tu­tional cri­sis that paves the way for the mil­i­tary to once again as­sume the reins of gov­ern­ment. This is de­spite the fact that the junta-drafted Con­sti­tu­tion is silent on elec­tion de­lays.</p>
    <p>The de­bate is prob­a­bly moot at this point, be­cause there are no signs the elec­tion will be post­poned – how­ever pre­car­i­ous the cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>The elec­tion com­mis­sion has started col­lect­ing overseas bal­lots. On Tues­day, it held a dry run at a Naypy­itaw high school, com­plete with face masks, hand sani­tis­ers, and tem­per­a­ture checks for mock vot­ers well spaced apart.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts say it re­mains to be seen if such safety ar­range­ments can be repli­cated na­tion­wide.</p>
    <p>The com­mis­sion has mean­while been slammed for cen­sor­ing po­lit­i­cal par­ties’ broad­casts on state me­dia, lend­ing to the per­cep­tion that the ground is heav­ily tilted in favour of the rul­ing Na­tional League for Democ­racy (NLD).</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal par­ties were given 15-minute ra­dio and tele­vi­sion slots.</p>
    <p>But democ­racy ac­tivist Ko Ko</p>
    <p>Gyi, who leads the Peo­ple’s Party, told Ra­dio Free Asia that the com­mis­sion tried to re­move from its pre­sen­ta­tion a state­ment on how high bank in­ter­est rates make it dif­fi­cult for lo­cal en­trepreneur­s to com­pete against for­eign in­vestors.</p>
    <p>The eth­nic-based Chin Na­tional League for Democ­racy said the com­mis­sion tried to cen­sor its de­mand to have an equal num­ber of Up­per House rep­re­sen­ta­tives from the eth­nic Ba­mar ma­jor­ity and eth­nic mi­nori­ties, as well as a line at­tribut­ing Myan­mar’s civil war to eth­nic mi­nori­ties feel­ing that they are be­ing dom­i­nated by the Ba­mar ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>In protest, both par­ties de­cided not to with­draw their broad­casts from state me­dia.</p>
    <p>The votes of the eth­nic mi­nori­ties, who make up about 30 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion, will be closely watched, given that sev­eral eth­nic-based par­ties that closed ranks with NLD in the 2015 elec­tion have now cho­sen to go their own.</p>
    <p>For these par­ties, top­ics like the civil war, fed­er­al­ism and eth­nic mi­nor­ity rights are bread and but­ter, says Ms Ying Lao, deputy di­rec­tor of the Sal­ween In­sti­tute for Pub­lic Pol­icy.</p>
    <p>“These are the core is­sues that eth­nic po­lit­i­cal par­ties stand for,” she told The Straits Times. “Ask­ing them not to talk about their core is­sues, is ask­ing them to not ex­ist.”</p>
    <p>So far, re­stric­tions on mass gath­er­ings are help­ing to re­duce pos­si­ble con­fronta­tion be­tween sup­port­ers of ri­val po­lit­i­cal par­ties, says Ms Mya Nan­dar Thin, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of New Myan­mar Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>But Mr Ye Kyaw Swar Myint, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of elec­tion mon­i­tor Peo­ple’s Al­liance for Cred­i­ble Elec­tions (Pace), says Myan­mar risks a low turnout if the com­mis­sion can­not con­vince peo­ple it is safe to vote.</p>
    <p>On the bright side, peo­ple still value elec­tions de­spite the strug­gles faced by the civil­ian gov­ern­ment in man­ag­ing an es­sen­tially au­ton­o­mous mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a 2,577-per­son sur­vey by Pace re­leased this week , 53 per cent of re­spon­dents dis­agreed with the state­ment that “it does not mat­ter how I vote, noth­ing will change”.</p>
    <p>Ms Suu Kyi alone, with a do­mes­tic stature boosted by fre­quent Face­book video ap­pear­ances, prob­a­bly has what it takes to de­liver NLD to the win­ner’s podium.</p>
    <p>Asked to rate their trust in gov­ern­ment of­fices or or­gan­i­sa­tions – in­clud­ing the United Na­tions and the mil­i­tary – re­spon­dents gave their high­est votes to the state coun­sel­lor.</p>
