    <p>For the past three weeks, Mr Ra­jesh Mulani, 50, has been in­un­dated with in­quiries for fut­sal courts.</p>
    <p>The co-owner of fut­sal fa­cil­ity The Cage, which has pitches at Kal­lang and Turf City, has be­come ac­cus­tomed to the sight of six empty pitches in front of him at his Kal­lang premises.</p>
    <p>But like other pri­vate op­er­a­tors, he has seen a surge in book­ings in re­cent weeks fol­low­ing Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong’s an­nounce­ment that Sin­ga­pore will move into phase three.</p>
    <p>Group size lim­its were in­creased from five to eight from Mon­day, and while safe man­age­ment rules dic­tate there must be no min­gling be­tween groups, the eas­ing of re­stric­tions has been a re­prieve for team sports like fut­sal and floor­ball.</p>
    <p>Mr Mulani said: “While the sweet spot would have been 10, at least a sem­blance of a game can hap­pen with eight peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“From around 30 per cent util­i­sa­tion com­pared with pre-Covid-19, we were at about 60 per cent this past week. But we have to bear in mind it was a pe­cu­liar week, with school hol­i­days and adults clear­ing their leave at the end of the year to co­in­cide with the New Year break.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple will also take time to re­form their groups and so­cial dy­nam­ics, be­cause we are not al­lowed to have more than eight peo­ple lin­ger­ing around as sub­sti­tutes.</p>
    <p>“So, while we don’t ex­pect this surge to con­tinue ev­ery week, we do hope to see some growth from phase two.”</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses like his – Mr Mulani es­ti­mates his monthly run­ning costs, ex­clud­ing rent, to be be­tween $70,000 and $80,000 – were hit hard by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Sports fa­cil­i­ties were closed dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker (April 7 to June 1) and phase one (June 2 to 18). Even when they were al­lowed to restart oper­a­tions in phase two, the rule-of-five made sports like fut­sal and floor­ball im­prac­ti­cal.</p>
    <p>A few doors down Jalan Be­naan Ka­pal, floor­ball fa­cil­ity Red Quar­ters is also ex­pe­ri­enc­ing an uptick in book­ings for its two courts.</p>
    <p>Sens­ing an op­por­tu­nity, with pent-up de­mand here to play sports, the own­ers – a group of five floor­ball en­thu­si­asts – took over the fa­cil­ity in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Co-owner Geral­dine Tan said:</p>
    <p>“We want to serve the floor­ball com­mu­nity by pro­vid­ing a place that’s safe and fun. Dur­ing phase two, we split our courts into two for groups to play three-ver­sustwo in each area, with no min­gling be­tween groups al­lowed.</p>
    <p>“Ever since we en­tered phase three, the book­ing rates have been very en­cour­ag­ing and we are see­ing an in­crease of about 50 per cent.</p>
    <p>“With groups of eight al­lowed now, teams usu­ally play four-aside with no goal­keep­ers. Of course, it would be bet­ter if we can have groups of 10 or 12 to get as close as pos­si­ble to the reg­u­lar sixa-side games, but we un­der­stand it is a grad­ual process to­wards nor­mal­ity.”</p>
    <p>Sta­dio Fut­sal Sin­ga­pore, which has 10 courts across five venues and is co-owned by for­mer Sin­ga­pore na­tional foot­ball coach V. Sun­dramoor­thy and Sin­ga­pore Premier League’s Balestier Khalsa coach Marko Kral­je­vic, saw its rev­enue dive by 90 per cent be­fore phase three.</p>
    <p>The op­er­a­tor, how­ever, will con­tinue to of­fer its cur­rent pro­mo­tional rates of $60 to $70 an hour. Mr Kral­je­vic said this was to en­sure foot traf­fic with a longer-term view.</p>
    <p>He noted: “Book­ings are slowly build­ing up again... by up to 50 per cent to 60 per cent this past week. The sit­u­a­tion is a big im­prove­ment, but we also un­der­stand it is not the same as be­fore.</p>
    <p>“In the past, peo­ple come in groups of 15 and each pays less than $10 an hour to play dur­ing the peak pe­riod. If we were to charge the nor­mal rates with groups of eight now, peo­ple may find it too ex­pen­sive to play, so we de­cided to keep the pric­ing down for now, and hope things will fully open up.”</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 cri­sis has also forced the likes of Mr Mulani to ex­plore other ways to bring in rev­enue. The Cage launched a foot­ball fit­ness pro­gramme for ama­teurs in August, and is ex­plor­ing us­ing some of its larger 11-a-side pitches at Turf City for cricket.</p>
    <p>Na­tional agency Sport Sin­ga­pore has also slowly eased its re­stric­tions. In its lat­est ad­vi­sory, the agency in­creased the limit for per­sons al­lowed at all sports and re­cre­ational fa­cil­i­ties. The ca­pac­ity for venues is now the gross floor area di­vided by 8 sq m per per­son – in­stead of 10 sq m – or 50 per­sons, which­ever is lower.</p>
    <p>AT LEAST A GAME CAN HAP­PEN While the sweet spot would have been 10, at least a sem­blance of a game can hap­pen with eight peo­ple. MR RA­JESH MULANI, co-owner of fut­sal fa­cil­ity The Cage, on the in­crease in group size lim­its.</p>
