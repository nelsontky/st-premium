    <p>A babysit­ter who poi­soned two ba­bies un­der her care with an as­sort­ment of medicines, in­clud­ing some used to treat in­som­nia and anx­i­ety disor­ders, was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to seven years in jail.</p>
    <p>District Judge John Ng had ear­lier con­victed Sa’adiah Ja­mari of two counts of giv­ing poi­sons to the ba­bies, who both sur­vived.</p>
    <p>Sa’adiah, 39, who was a free­lance nurse, com­mit­ted the of­fences on sep­a­rate oc­ca­sions in Novem­ber and De­cem­ber 2016 against the lit­tle girls, who are not re­lated.</p>
    <p>At the time of the of­fences, one of the girls was five months old, while the other was 11 months old.</p>
    <p>The younger girl’s 29-year-old mother had tes­ti­fied dur­ing the trial that in Oc­to­ber 2016, she needed a babysit­ter for her baby and older daugh­ter, who was then five years old.</p>
    <p>Sa’adiah, a di­vorcee with two teenage chil­dren of her own, started tak­ing care of the girls in early Novem­ber that year.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a few vis­its, the younger vic­tim’s mother no­ticed that her baby ap­peared “cranky”.</p>
    <p>She said that the fourth time or so this hap­pened, in late Novem­ber that year, she de­cided to take the child to KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal (KKH).</p>
    <p>The court heard that a health­care pro­fes­sional, af­ter ex­am­in­ing the baby, said she seemed “fine” and that no poi­sonous sub­stances were found in the child.</p>
    <p>The child’s mother took her to Park­way East Hos­pi­tal the fol­low­ing month when the girl’s con­di­tion did not im­prove. The girl was warded for about five days and the mother re­ceived a hos­pi­tal re­port list­ing mul­ti­ple sub­stances de­tected in the baby’s body. They in­cluded the sleep­ing drug temazepam, an­ti­his­tamine chlor­pheni­ramine and al­pra­zo­lam, which is used to treat anx­i­ety disor­ders.</p>
    <p>The other baby’s mother, 22, also tes­ti­fied in court, telling Judge Ng that she had cre­ated a Face­book post in De­cem­ber 2016, stat­ing that she needed some­body to look af­ter her baby on Christ­mas evening.</p>
    <p>Her boyfriend picked up the baby around 6am the next day, and the woman no­ticed that her daugh­ter seemed “tired”.</p>
    <p>The baby was taken to KKH that day and ad­mit­ted. A urine sam­ple taken from the child was later found to con­tain sub­stances that in­cluded al­pra­zo­lam. She was dis­charged on Jan 1, 2017.</p>
    <p>Sa’adiah is ap­peal­ing against her con­vic­tion and sen­tence, and is out on bail of $20,000.</p>
    <p>Her name can no longer be found on the list of health­care pro­fes­sion­als in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
