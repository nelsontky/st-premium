    <p>rest on those lau­rels.</p>
    <p>Though the Gov­ern­ment has met its pro­duc­tiv­ity growth tar­get for the last decade, it re­mains an is­sue that the Repub­lic, along­side many other coun­tries, grap­ples with.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has also brought with it new chal­lenges that Sin­ga­pore has to tackle.</p>
    <p>More­over, labour pro­duc­tiv­ity gains may be harder to achieve at al­ready high lev­els, says May­bank Kim Eng se­nior economist Chua Hak Bin.</p>
    <p>Amid the Covid-19 cri­sis, he notes that labour pro­duc­tiv­ity will “plunge” this year, as many firms are re­tain­ing work­ers in ex­cess of de­mand needs, es­pe­cially air­lines, and recre­ation and hos­pi­tal­ity play­ers.</p>
    <p>“Wage sub­si­dies help firms re­tain work­ers, but do not help boost labour pro­duc­tiv­ity. The gen­er­ous Jobs Sup­port Scheme is de­lay­ing the re­struc­tur­ing and re­de­ploy­ment of work­ers from shrink­ing to grow­ing sec­tors,” he adds.</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank’s head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy Se­lena Ling notes that while over­all labour pro­duc­tiv­ity has grown since 20 years ago, the pic­ture may be un­even across sec­tors, with out­ward-fac­ing sec­tors like man­u­fac­tur­ing and fi­nan­cial ser­vices gen­er­ally out­per­form­ing do­mes­tic sec­tors such as con­struc­tion and re­tail.</p>
    <p>“Typ­i­cally, the out­ward-ori­ented sec­tor (faces) global com­pe­ti­tion, so rais­ing the value-add per worker may be a mat­ter of sur­vival since it serves global de­mand,” she says, point­ing out that for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment and port­fo­lio flows are highly mo­bile.</p>
    <p>But there have been moves by pol­i­cy­mak­ers to im­prove pro­duc­tiv­ity in do­mes­tic sec­tors, Ms Ling says.</p>
    <p>Dr Chua notes that lim­ited pro­duc­tiv­ity gains have been seen in growth sec­tors such as health­care, ed­u­ca­tion and so­cial ser­vices, which could have been a drag on Sin­ga­pore’s over­all labour pro­duc­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>“Man­u­fac­tur­ing tasks are far eas­ier to au­to­mate than ser­vices, which are typ­i­cally more labour in­ten­sive. Re­plac­ing hair­dressers, nurses, plumbers and teach­ers with ro­bots is not (as) straight­for­ward.”</p>
    <p>On the im­pact of for­eign labour on Sin­ga­pore’s pro­duc­tiv­ity, Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore eco­nom­ics pro­fes­sor Ivan Png says: “In the­ory, the sup­ply of for­eign work­ers would re­duce the in­cen­tive of busi­nesses to au­to­mate and up­skill lo­cal work­ers.</p>
    <p>“The re­sult would be rel­a­tively lower wages for lo­cal work­ers.”</p>
    <p>But this ef­fect is weaker in in­dus­tries that are less in­ten­sive in lowskilled labour, he notes.</p>
    <p>CON­CERTED EF­FORT</p>
    <p>Yet, the Gov­ern­ment’s com­mit­ment to in­creas­ing pro­duc­tiv­ity for eco­nomic growth has been ev­i­dent th­ese past 10 years in the form of poli­cies that have sought to re­duce the Repub­lic’s re­liance on for­eign labour and drive pro­duc­tiv­ity gains through au­to­ma­tion and dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>In the 2010 Bud­get state­ment, the word “pro­duc­tiv­ity” was men­tioned 72 times, more than dou­ble the pre­vi­ous peak of 26 times in 1983.</p>
    <p>The re­newed fo­cus on pro­duc­tiv­ity came amid ac­knowl­edge­ment that Sin­ga­pore’s growth in the late 2000s had been driven through a rapid in­crease in for­eign labour, which has be­come a struc­tural prob­lem to­day.</p>
    <p>In­deed, the an­nual in­creases in labour pro­duc­tiv­ity show that the Gov­ern­ment’s push for pro­duc­tiv­ity gains has made some head­way. But the dif­fer­ent work con­di­tions of to­day must also be fac­tored in when con­sid­er­ing pro­duc­tiv­ity gains.</p>
    <p>In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies se­nior re­search fel­low Faizal Yahya says that the in­dus­try en­vi­ron­ment has changed dras­ti­cally in the past few years with the ad­vent of In­dus­try 4.0, which makes it dif­fi­cult to as­sess if Sin­ga­pore work­ers are more pro­duc­tive than they were 20 years ago. Fur­ther changes are afoot due to the needs of in­dus­try th­ese days.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion has re­sulted in changes in job scopes and work­ers have ac­quired new skills to adapt to th­ese busi­ness trans­for­ma­tions,” he adds.</p>
    <p>Mr Samir Bedi, Asean work­force ad­vi­sory leader at pro­fes­sional ser­vices firm EY, points out that while worker pro­duc­tiv­ity has risen over the years, or­gan­i­sa­tions need to em­bark on dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion to drive pro­duc­tiv­ity to a higher level.</p>
    <p>“In­stead of ask­ing if our work­ers are more pro­duc­tive, it is also timely to ask if or­gan­i­sa­tions are ready for the dig­i­tal fu­ture and re­shap­ing their work­ers’ roles and tasks ac­cord­ingly to drive pro­duc­tiv­ity.”</p>
    <p>Man­u­fac­tur­ing tasks are far eas­ier to au­to­mate than ser­vices, which are typ­i­cally more labour in­ten­sive. Re­plac­ing hair­dressers, nurses, plumbers and teach­ers with ro­bots is not (as) straight­for­ward.</p>
