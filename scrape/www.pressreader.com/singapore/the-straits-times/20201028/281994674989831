    <p>This year, re­tail­ers have de­clared war on an un­likely en­emy: Christ­mas glit­ter.</p>
    <p>Those sparkly bits of plas­tic that make or­na­ments twin­kle, wrap­ping pa­per glim­mer and wreaths shim­mer are in­creas­ingly seen as an en­vi­ron­men­tal haz­ard.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, three Bri­tish re­tail­ers are elim­i­nat­ing them from gift bags, Christ­mas crack­ers and other hol­i­day staples. Thus a more sus­tain­able and guilt-free Christ­mas will be had by all.</p>
    <p>Or so the think­ing goes. It is not a crazy idea. Tiny pieces of plas­tic are in­deed a threat to the en­vi­ron­ment, and re­tail­ers can make a dif­fer­ence in re­duc­ing them. But do­ing so will re­quire far more than ban­ning hol­i­day baubles. It’ll mean re­think­ing how ev­ery­day plas­tics are man­u­fac­tured and mar­keted to con­sumers in the first place.</p>
    <p>Plas­tic pol­lu­tion, es­pe­cially in the ocean, is typ­i­cally as­so­ci­ated with sin­gle-use items such as bags and straws. But in re­cent years, sci­en­tists have also fo­cused on the pro­fu­sion of so-called mi­croplas­tics, which are about the size of a sesame seed or less.</p>
    <p>Some of th­ese are gen­er­ated by the break­down and abra­sion of larger prod­ucts. But a sig­nif­i­cant per­cent­age are “pri­mary mi­croplas­tics”, such as syn­thetic cloth­ing fi­bres, worn tyre treads and the mi­crobeads used in prod­ucts such as tooth­paste and body scrubs. They add up. Hu­mans re­lease about 1.5 mil­lion tonnes of pri­mary mi­croplas­tics into the ocean an­nu­ally, a sum equiv­a­lent to one dis­gorged plas­tic bag for ev­ery per­son each week. Such pol­lu­tants now make up as much as 31 per cent of all ocean plas­tic, and they turn up all over the ma­rine en­vi­ron­ment, from the ocean sur­face to the seafloor to the guts of a wide range of fauna.</p>
    <p>Fix­ing the prob­lem is not easy, in part be­cause the ma­jor sources of mi­croplas­tics are not eas­ily reg­u­lated. A com­pre­hen­sive 2017 study of the prob­lem found that just 2 per cent of such plas­tics come from mi­crobeads, which sev­eral coun­tries have started re­strict­ing.</p>
    <p>The lead­ing source – at 35 per cent – turned out to be clothes made from syn­thetic tex­tiles (such as hol­i­day-themed po­lar fleece pullovers) that had been run through the laun­dry.</p>
    <p>In sec­ond place, at 28 per cent, were the abraded bits of car and truck tyres that wash from roads into wa­ter­ways. Glit­ter did not even make the list. But it has be­come some­thing of a pop-cul­ture pariah none­the­less.</p>
    <p>In 2017, glit­ter-scep­ti­cal stud­ies in­spired a Bri­tish day­care chain to stop or­der­ing the stuff for its pre-school­ers. In 2018, Strictly Come Danc­ing, a Bri­tish tele­vi­sion show, an­nounced that glit­ter would no longer be wel­come on con­tes­tants’ cos­tumes.</p>
    <p>Re­tail­ers soon fol­lowed suit. with Waitrose mak­ing plans to ban glit­ter from its own-brand prod­ucts. In re­cent weeks, John Lewis Part­ner­ship and Wm Mor­ri­son Su­per­mar­kets have taken sim­i­lar steps.</p>
    <p>Th­ese ef­forts will not do much to re­duce ma­rine plas­tics (boat paint, not Christ­mas, is the lead­ing mar­ket for glit­ter). But they do of­fer re­tail­ers a way to bur­nish their en­vi­ron­men­tal bona fides with­out hav­ing to mean­ing­fully al­ter how they op­er­ate.</p>
    <p>Mor­risons re­cently went so far as to tell the BBC that it adopted its anti-glit­ter stance so that cus­tomers can en­joy the hol­i­days “with­out wor­ry­ing about the en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact.”</p>
    <p>Shop­pers are un­likely to be fooled by such rhetoric for long. As anti-plas­tic sen­ti­ment grows glob­ally, Bri­tish con­sumers are al­ready de­mand­ing sus­tain­able prod­ucts and shop­ping ex­pe­ri­ences. In time, they will ex­pect re­tail­ers and brands to ad­dress the prod­ucts that are ac­tu­ally con­tribut­ing to the prob­lem.</p>
    <p>The good news is that sev­eral com­pa­nies are on the right track. Lead­ing ap­parel brands – in­clud­ing Patag­o­nia, Adi­das and Hennes & Mau­ritz – have ac­knowl­edged that their syn­thetic gar­ments are a ma­jor source of plas­tic mi­crofi­bre pol­lu­tion. Some are re­search­ing bet­ter man­u­fac­tur­ing meth­ods, while oth­ers are ed­u­cat­ing con­sumers on how to care for gar­ments so that they pol­lute less.</p>
    <p>Re­tail­ers could play an im­por­tant role in am­pli­fy­ing that mes­sage. They could start by mar­ket­ing best prac­tices for man­ag­ing syn­thetic gar­ments and of­fer­ing prod­ucts such as fil­ter bags and front-load­ing wash­ers that help re­duce fi­bre pol­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>Long term, th­ese ef­forts should pres­sure man­u­fac­tur­ers into cre­at­ing more sus­tain­able prod­ucts, and nudge con­sumers to­wards think­ing twice about the en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact of their cloth­ing.</p>
    <p>That will not bring back the once-beloved hol­i­day glit­ter. But it will en­sure that re­tail­ers are not just fak­ing it when they say they are go­ing green.</p>
