    <p>The Pub­lic Hy­giene Coun­cil (PHC) agrees with the views ex­pressed in the let­ters on prob­lems of lit­ter­ing and tray re­turn. Some of them in­clude: Find new ways to break bad habit of lit­ter­ing (Sept 15); Three-pronged ap­proach to lit­ter man­age­ment more ef­fec­tive (Sept 18); Time to pe­nalise those not re­turn­ing trays at food cen­tres (Sept 22); Use per­sua­sion to bring about be­havioural change; Change be­hav­iour through penal­ties and at­ti­tude will fol­low suit; Pass law and make it clear (Sept 25); Mess left be­hind by din­ers is a health haz­ard (Sept 29).</p>
    <p>For years, the PHC has been work­ing with var­i­ous groups, rang­ing from schools, par­ents and grass­roots com­mu­ni­ties to cin­ema and food busi­ness op­er­a­tors and cor­po­ra­tions, to per­suade and ed­u­cate the pub­lic on good hy­giene habits in pub­lic places.</p>
    <p>There has been im­prove­ment in some ar­eas, but less in ar­eas such as re­turn­ing trays. A pub­lic clean­li­ness sat­is­fac­tion sur­vey showed that 36 per cent of peo­ple were un­sure if they should re­turn trays, and about the same pro­por­tion ex­pected clean­ers to do the job in­stead.</p>
    <p>As with mem­bers of the pub­lic, the PHC has also been call­ing for tougher laws to com­ple­ment its ed­u­ca­tional ef­forts.</p>
    <p>We are pleased that the Sus­tain­abil­ity and En­vi­ron­ment Min­istry will in­tro­duce new reg­u­la­tions to en­force higher hy­giene and clean­li­ness stan­dards on busi­ness op­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>We urge the min­istry to also en­force ex­ist­ing anti-lit­ter­ing laws more rig­or­ously and pass new laws re­quir­ing trays, left­over food and used cut­lery to be re­turned to re­ceiv­ing sta­tions at pub­lic eater­ies such as hawker cen­tres, cof­fee shops, food­courts and can­teens.</p>
    <p>In the same sur­vey, al­most all of those sur­veyed agreed there should be laws re­quir­ing stricter hy­giene for pub­lic spa­ces, such as food es­tab­lish­ments and malls.</p>
    <p>We are also car­ry­ing out re­search on peo­ple’s at­ti­tudes and be­hav­iours to­wards lit­ter­ing, and the ef­fec­tive­ness of dif­fer­ent forms of in­ter­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>PHC wel­comes views and sug­ges­tions and hopes that ev­ery­one will work to­gether to keep Sin­ga­pore clean, green and safe. Ed­ward D’Silva</p>
