    <p>In a mus­cu­lar warn­ing to the United States, China fired a se­ries of mis­siles into the South China Sea ear­lier this week, just as the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion sanc­tioned dozens of Chi­nese com­pa­nies linked to China’s mil­i­tari­sa­tion of the dis­puted wa­ters.</p>
    <p>Four medium-range bal­lis­tic mis­siles were ap­par­ently dropped into wa­ters be­tween Hainan is­land and the dis­puted Para­cel Is­lands on Wed­nes­day, as part of the Chi­nese mil­i­tary’s on­go­ing drills, said me­dia re­ports, cit­ing sources.</p>
    <p>The mis­sile tests come at a time when Sino-US ten­sions are at their high­est in decades, and on the back of height­ened mil­i­tary ex­er­cises by the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army (PLA) that an­a­lysts say are un­prece­dented.</p>
    <p>They also co­in­cide with this year’s Rim of the Pa­cific Ex­er­cise, the largest in­ter­na­tional mar­itime ex­er­cise led by the US, in­volv­ing 10 navies in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore’s.</p>
    <p>In the lat­est salvo by the US, its Com­merce Depart­ment on Wed­nes­day placed visa and trade re­stric­tions on 24 com­pa­nies for help­ing the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties re­claim and mil­i­tarise out­posts in the con­tested sea.</p>
    <p>China’s Na­tional De­fence Min­istry yes­ter­day did not con­firm re­ports of the mis­sile launches, but said it was con­duct­ing both sea and air ex­er­cises around the Para­cel and Spratly is­lands as part of its an­nual train­ing sched­ule.</p>
    <p>Its spokesman, Se­nior Colonel Wu Qian, told re­porters at a reg­u­lar brief­ing that its re­cent drills in the South China Sea and the Yel­low Sea “are not tar­geted at any coun­try”.</p>
    <p>The anti-ship bal­lis­tic mis­siles – with a range of be­tween 1,800km and 4,000km – were launched a day af­ter Bei­jing ex­pressed anger over an ap­par­ent in­cur­sion by a US spy plane, which it said had en­tered a no-fly zone.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese De­fence Min­istry called the move by the US a “naked provoca­tive ac­tion”, say­ing it had “se­ri­ously dis­rupted China’s nor­mal ex­er­cises and train­ing ac­tiv­i­ties, se­ri­ously vi­o­lat­ing the Chi­naUS mar­itime and air safety code of con­duct and re­lated in­ter­na­tional prac­tices, and eas­ily lead­ing to mis­un­der­stand­ings”.</p>
    <p>The US said its U2 re­con­nais­sance plane op­er­a­tion did not break any rules.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to the mis­sile test­ing, US Navy Vice-Ad­mi­ral Scott Conn said yes­ter­day: “As long as they’re do­ing it in ac­cor­dance with in­ter­na­tional law and norms, they have every right to do so.”</p>
    <p>Viet­nam has protested China’s mil­i­tary drills around the Para­cel Is­lands, which it claims, say­ing they vi­o­late its sovereignt­y.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Ja­pan also ex­pressed con­cern over the mis­sile fir­ing.</p>
    <p>In July last year, China tested anti-ship mis­siles near the Spratly Is­lands, shortly af­ter one of the US Navy’s big­gest war­ships, air­craft car­rier USS Ron­ald Rea­gan, con­ducted joint ex­er­cises with Ja­pan in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>Mil­i­tary an­a­lyst Alexan­der Neill, who runs a strate­gic ad­vi­sory con­sul­tancy in Sin­ga­pore, said: “There’s a broad ac­knowl­edge­ment that th­ese (the re­cent mis­sile tests) are to demon­strate China’s anti-car­rier ca­pa­bil­ity.”</p>
    <p>He said the mis­siles were dropped in a zone be­tween the Para­cel Is­lands and Hainan, where China’s nuclear sub­marines are based.</p>
    <p>This area would be a po­ten­tial ac­cess point where China could launch a nuclear de­ter­rent and where its ad­ver­saries could try to stop it.</p>
    <p>It is also highly un­usual for the PLA to hold near-si­mul­ta­ne­ous ex­er­cises across mul­ti­ple seas – the South China Sea, East China Sea, Yel­low Sea and Bo­hai Sea.</p>
    <p>The move is a strong sig­nal to the US that th­ese sur­round­ing wa­ters are all within the PLA’s cov­er­age, said naval af­fairs ex­pert Collin Koh.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese wa­ters are tra­di­tion­ally part of the near seas for China and, in re­cent years, we have seen a con­ver­gence on an un­der­stand­ing that the PLA is able to pre­vail in a con­flict within the near seas be­cause they have al­ready gained those ca­pa­bil­i­ties,” said Dr Koh, a re­search fel­low at the In­sti­tute of De­fence and Strate­gic Stud­ies in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>With the in­ten­si­fi­ca­tion of mil­i­tary ac­tiv­ity, the po­ten­tial for un­man­aged es­ca­la­tion in­creases, says Mr Neill.</p>
    <p>“And while there are pro­to­cols in place for un­planned en­coun­ters, those work when every­one is pro­fes­sional. But if there’s a mis­take or er­ror of judg­ment, then you run into trou­ble,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Al­most 20 years on from the Hainan col­li­sion, I think the stakes are much, much higher.”</p>
    <p>A PLA fighter jet crashed into a US spy plane it was in­ter­cept­ing near Hainan in 2001, re­sult­ing in the death of its pi­lot.</p>
