    <p>There will be an­other 50 mil­lion mid­dle-class con­sumers in South-east Asia by 2022, but how can busi­nesses cap­i­talise on this enor­mous op­por­tu­nity? This is the third in a four-part se­ries, The Edges Of South-east Asia – a joint pro­ject of Deloitte, Sin­ga­pore’s Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board and the US-Asean Busi­ness Coun­cil – which fo­cuses each week on a spe­cific “edge” or cus­tomer seg­ment, ge­o­graphic mar­ket or prod­uct that of­fers high growth po­ten­tial op­por­tu­ni­ties in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>It seems un­likely that putting pork floss on top of a sim­ple white-bread bun could help power a com­pany’s ex­pan­sion to 17 in­ter­na­tional mar­kets.</p>
    <p>But that is what has hap­pened at Bread­Talk, the high-growth food and bev­er­age group that sprouted from a sin­gle out­let in Sin­ga­pore’s Bugis Junc­tion sell­ing its sig­na­ture Flosss buns. It has since grown to span 11 food brands, em­ploy close to 7,000 peo­ple and open al­most 1,000 out­lets in Asean and around the world.</p>
    <p>We be­lieve the Bread­Talk story of­fers lessons for other busi­nesses look­ing to suc­ceed in South-east Asia as the re­gion con­tin­ues its me­te­oric rise. The 10 na­tions that make up Asean are al­ready home to more than 650 mil­lion peo­ple and have a com­bined gross do­mes­tic prod­uct of about US$3 tril­lion (S$4 tril­lion). If these na­tions were one coun­try, they would be the fifth-largest econ­omy in the world.</p>
    <p>They would also be among the fastest chang­ing. The per­cent­age of peo­ple in the re­gion cat­e­gorised as mid­dle-class is ex­pected to more than dou­ble from 24 per cent to­day to 51 per cent in 2030 – or from 135 mil­lion peo­ple to 334 mil­lion peo­ple. By 2022, the Asean mid­dle class is ex­pected to wield over US$300 bil­lion in dis­pos­able in­come.</p>
    <p>Some have rightly ob­served that the pri­mary defin­ing char­ac­ter­is­tic of South-east Asia is di­ver­sity. Oth­ers have ar­gued that this is es­sen­tially an­other way of say­ing that South-east Asia has no defin­ing char­ac­ter­is­tics. How­ever, one only needs to look a lit­tle closer to find that the Asean mid­dle class is in fact united by a few key trends.</p>
    <p>GLOBAL YET LO­CAL</p>
    <p>As com­pa­nies like Bread­Talk un­der­stand, Asean is not a mono­lithic en­tity but a di­verse col­lec­tion of na­tions, each with its own rich his­tory and cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Such suc­cess­ful com­pa­nies also un­der­stand that the re­gion’s in­creas­ingly af­flu­ent con­sumers want the best of both global of­fer­ings and their own unique cul­ture.</p>
    <p>For a com­pany like Bread­Talk, this means pro­vid­ing a lo­cal del­i­cacy in clean, mod­ern and air-con­di­tioned stores, and adapt­ing its menu to suit dif­fer­ent mar­kets in the re­gion. It also means cre­at­ing so­phis­ti­cated and large-scale re­gional busi­ness sys­tems and sup­ply chains to match lo­cal con­di­tions across the di­verse Asean re­gion and be­yond.</p>
    <p>Bread­Talk is not the only com­pany mak­ing global goods and ser­vices meet lo­cal needs. Mimpikita, which means “our dreams” in Malay, is a fash­ion la­bel es­tab­lished by a trio of sis­ters from Malaysia that fo­cuses on high-end “mod­est” fash­ion. Their brand made it to the Lon­don Fash­ion Week and has since gar­nered a large fol­low­ing among the re­gion’s Mus­lim pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The Global Ha­lal Data Pool – an in­for­ma­tion re­pos­i­tory de­vel­oped by Serunai Com­merce that con­nects ha­lal sup­pli­ers to man­u­fac­tur­ers, buy­ers, and re­tail­ers to syn­chro­nise the list­ing of their ha­lal-cer­ti­fied prod­ucts glob­ally – is an­other in­stance of a ser­vice tai­lored to lo­cal needs.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies out­side of South-east Asia are also look­ing to put lo­cal cul­tures on the global stage. For ex­am­ple, since 2015, a United States com­pany, 88ris­ing – a new-age me­dia and mu­sic com­pany com­mit­ted to telling an au­then­tic Asian story in an era of dig­i­tal me­dia – has men­tored mul­ti­ple artists from coun­tries such as In­done­sia and the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>This ap­proach is known as “glo­cal­i­sa­tion”, and holds the key to suc­cess for any busi­ness look­ing to ben­e­fit from the bur­geon­ing Asean mid­dle class. There­fore, it is im­por­tant for firms to re­ally un­der­stand what it means to “go glo­cal” in Asean to­day. This means look­ing be­yond the big-pic­ture changes in de­mo­graph­ics and wealth to con­sider how fac­tors such as ur­ban­i­sa­tion, cul­ture and even Covid-19 are shap­ing the emer­gence of the re­gion’s mid­dle class.</p>
    <p>UR­BAN­I­SA­TION AND EMER­GENCE OF THE MID­DLE CLASS</p>
    <p>There is a close as­so­ci­a­tion be­tween ris­ing in­comes and ur­ban­i­sa­tion in South-east Asia. The re­gion’s largest cities are the pri­mary driv­ers of eco­nomic growth and home to most mid­dle-class cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>An­other 90 mil­lion peo­ple are ex­pected to move to the re­gion’s ma­jor cities by 2030, and it is es­ti­mated that nearly 70 per cent of Asean’s pop­u­la­tion will live in ur­ban ar­eas by 2050. Those who are al­ready do­ing well are ex­pected to be­come even more af­flu­ent, join­ing the up­per-mid­dle class, with its own pref­er­ences and as­pi­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>How­ever, busi­nesses should not over­look the rapid growth that is oc­cur­ring in smaller mid­dle-weight cities. Re­search has shown that more than 200 such cities in South-east Asia are grow­ing faster than the high-pro­file cap­i­tals such as Bangkok and Hanoi.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, these smaller cities are ex­pected to drive about 40 per cent of the re­gion’s eco­nomic growth from now to 2030. For ex­am­ple, the In­done­sian cities of Ban­dung, Makas­sar and Surabaya are all grow­ing faster than Jakarta. While these are all places in which the mid­dle class will next emerge, other places to watch are cities ben­e­fit­ing from China’s Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive such as Luang Pra­bang in Laos and Nong Khai in Thai­land, which are cre­at­ing jobs through in­fra­struc­ture in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>DI­VERSE IDEN­TI­TIES</p>
    <p>The emerg­ing Asean mid­dle class will be em­bed­ded in a cul­tural melee and is en­abled by the dig­i­tal ecosys­tem. In other words, South-east Asians will not be a one-di­men­sional mid­dle-class.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the dig­i­tal econ­omy en­ables them to jug­gle their iden­ti­ties as fam­ily mem­bers and as mi­cro-en­trepreneur­s. One can be a full-time par­ent whilst mak­ing money by work­ing as an app-hail­ing driver with Grab or Go­jek or be a stu­dent whilst man­ag­ing home-based busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>South-east Asia also sits at the cross­roads be­tween a tra­di­tion­ally Western-dom­i­nated In­ter­net, a grow­ing Chi­nese In­ter­net cul­ture, and its own emerg­ing na­tive on­line spa­ces.</p>
    <p>Sub­cul­tures like those of K-Pop, Ja­panese anime and even Amer­i­can-led green cul­ture are also in­flu­en­tial. Peo­ple might lis­ten to Amer­i­can pop mu­sic on Spo­tify, use TikTok for both leisure and busi­ness, and watch lo­cal films on Vid­dsee, a grow­ing plat­form for film-mak­ers in South-east Asia to show­case their works.</p>
    <p>With mid­dle-class life­styles also come mid­dle-class hob­bies, which are in turn an­other facet of one’s iden­tity. Leisure and en­ter­tain­ment will be a grow­ing as­pect of South-east Asians’ lives.</p>
    <p>The gam­ing in­dus­try is ex­plod­ing in South-east Asia, with re­lated sales reach­ing US$4.4 bil­lion in 2019. More­over, the toys, hob­bies and DIY seg­ment saw the fastest growth in on­line con­sumer ex­pen­di­ture after gro­ceries, sur­pass­ing US$3.6 bil­lion in 2018.</p>
    <p>The re­sult is that the Asean mid­dle-class con­sumers are defin­ing and ne­go­ti­at­ing rich, multi-lay­ered iden­ti­ties that tra­verse their home and work­ing lives, draw­ing on cul­tures from both the phys­i­cal and vir­tual worlds.</p>
    <p>COVID-19 RE­SHAP­ING THE RE­GION</p>
    <p>It is too early to say what im­pact Covid-19 might have on these longer-term trends. How­ever, there is rea­son to be­lieve the pan­demic will make it even more im­por­tant for com­pa­nies to con­sider glo­cal­i­sa­tion and to en­sure they have ef­fec­tive dig­i­tal strate­gies.</p>
    <p>It is widely recog­nised that the Covid-19 cri­sis has pushed eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity on­line, mak­ing the In­ter­net the new com­pet­i­tive bat­tle­ground for many busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, wide­spread travel re­stric­tions are forc­ing peo­ple to spend more time in their home and en­gag­ing with their lo­cal com­mu­nity and cul­ture. This may</p>
    <p>in­crease peo­ple’s pref­er­ences for prod­ucts and ser­vices that re­flect their lo­cal cul­ture, es­pe­cially those who re­fer back to sim­pler times.</p>
    <p>Many Asean gov­ern­ments have also in­tro­duced eco­nomic stim­u­lus mea­sures aimed at boost­ing eco­nomic re­silience by sus­tain­ing de­mand and con­sump­tion within their borders. These in­clude di­rect in­come sup­port pay­ments and grants to en­able lo­cal small busi­nesses to digi­tise their op­er­a­tions. Taken to­gether, these may fur­ther en­cour­age lo­calised pro­duc­tion and con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>AN EX­CEP­TIONAL PLACE FOR IN­NO­VA­TION AND BUSI­NESS</p>
    <p>The growth of the Asean mid­dle class presents a sig­nif­i­cant op­por­tu­nity for lo­cal and global busi­nesses. We are con­fi­dent that those who take the time to un­der­stand the rich and multi-lay­ered na­ture of the re­gion and act ac­cord­ingly will be re­warded.</p>
    <p>Just as the China-based ByteDance’s in­no­va­tive Tik Tok model of on­line com­mer­cial re­tail mar­ket­ing is now be­ing “tested” by Or­a­cle and Wal­mart in the United States, it would not be sur­pris­ing to see suc­cess­ful com­mer­cial part­ner­ships be­tween global com­pa­nies and in­no­va­tive Asean busi­nesses like Grab, Go­jek, and Lazada to de­velop new busi­ness mod­els and plat­forms for the re­gion and for global mar­kets.</p>
    <p>More­over, the ac­tive par­tic­i­pa­tion of Asean na­tions in global sup­ply chains is likely to ex­pand fur­ther as new free trade and dig­i­tal econ­omy agree­ments come into force across the re­gion.</p>
    <p>These agree­ments should at­tract for­eign pro­duc­ers of goods and ser­vices and en­cour­age them to in­vest in lo­cal com­pa­nies that can in­no­vate to meet the chang­ing needs and tastes of the re­gion’s con­sumers.</p>
    <p>This propen­sity for in­no­va­tion is one more rea­son why mar­kets in South-east Asia with fast-grow­ing mid­dle classes are not just good places to do busi­ness to­day but they are also places that will trans­form how busi­ness gets done to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>South-east Asians will not be a one-di­men­sional mid­dle-class...</p>
    <p>South-east Asia also sits at the cross­roads be­tween a tra­di­tion­ally Western-dom­i­nated In­ter­net, a grow­ing Chi­nese In­ter­net cul­ture, and its own emerg­ing na­tive on­line spa­ces.</p>
