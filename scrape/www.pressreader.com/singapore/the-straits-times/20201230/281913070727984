    <p>Suc­ces­sion plan­ning plays an in­te­gral role in the con­ti­nu­ity of pro­fes­sions and vo­ca­tions rang­ing from busi­ness to pol­i­tics, law to medicine, and teach­ing to en­gi­neer­ing. The trans­mis­sion of skills and val­ues en­sures that knowl­edge built up over gen­er­a­tions is not dis­si­pated in sit­u­a­tions where the young are not keen on keep­ing tra­di­tions alive, are in­ca­pable of do­ing so, or both. It is wel­come there­fore that the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) an­nounced that re­tir­ing hawk­ers will be given fi­nan­cial sup­port while they coach new hawk­ers to take over their stalls. This is an up­date on the hawker suc­ces­sion scheme, which matches re­tir­ing hawk­ers with new en­trants to the pro­fes­sion. The goal is to en­able older hawk­ers to teach and pass on their recipes to as­pi­rants, as their fam­ily mem­bers might not be in­ter­ested in con­tin­u­ing the trade.</p>
    <p>This is a prac­ti­cal way of keep­ing alive the cul­ture of food in Sin­ga­pore’s hawker cen­tres, which the NEA com­mends as a “unique com­bi­na­tion of food, space and com­mu­nity” that “has evolved into a mi­cro­cosm of Sin­ga­pore’s mul­ti­cul­tural so­ci­ety”. Many hawker dishes orig­i­nated in the culi­nary tra­di­tions of the im­mi­grant groups that set­tled in Sin­ga­pore. Over time, those prepa­ra­tions evolved from their for­eign origins to be­come dis­tinc­tive lo­cal dishes that con­trib­uted to Sin­ga­pore’s food her­itage.</p>
    <p>It is this con­tri­bu­tion that is cel­e­brated in the in­clu­sion of Sin­ga­pore’s hawker cul­ture in the Unesco Rep­re­sen­ta­tive List of the In­tan­gi­ble Cul­tural Her­itage of Hu­man­ity ear­lier this month. Although the hawker suc­ces­sion scheme was in­tro­duced shortly be­fore that in­ter­na­tional recog­ni­tion, the fine-tun­ing of the scheme will allow the author­i­ties to mon­i­tor the process of safe­guard­ing and trans­mit­ting hawker cul­ture to fu­ture gen­er­a­tions. For ex­am­ple, while re­tir­ing hawk­ers will be paid a nom­i­nal stipend for guid­ing as­pi­rants, the NEA will as­sess the lat­ter’s culi­nary skills be­fore pair­ing them with re­tir­ing hawk­ers. By fa­cil­i­tat­ing this process of men­tor­ing, the author­i­ties will pro­vide ad­min­is­tra­tive sup­port for the hawk­ing trade as a cul­tural good.</p>
    <p>For the scheme to work, it would have to an­swer to the two de­mands that ap­pren­tices in any pro­fes­sion have to meet be­fore they can win the ap­proval of their men­tor­ing vet­er­ans. First, they must want to be in the pro­fes­sion. Hawk­ing is not an ob­vi­ous choice for the young in a coun­try where phys­i­cally less oner­ous and so­cially more ac­cept­able op­por­tu­ni­ties are avail­able. Hence, en­trants would need to pos­sess a real pas­sion for cook­ing that com­bines the pur­suit of an art with the mak­ing of a liv­ing. Sec­ond, they would need to be pre­pared to learn with an open and cu­ri­ous mind from the mas­ters. That, after all, is how cul­tural knowl­edge sur­vives. Sin­ga­pore’s hawker cul­ture be­longs to a re­silient tra­di­tion.</p>
