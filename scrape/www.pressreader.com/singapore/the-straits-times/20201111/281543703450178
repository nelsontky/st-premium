    <p>The clear signs of an e-com­merce boom in Sin­ga­pore failed to pre­vent its In­ter­net econ­omy from tak­ing a hit from the pan­demic. There was a 24 per cent, or US$3 bil­lion (S$4 bil­lion), drop in the over­all In­ter­net econ­omy to US$9 bil­lion in gross mer­chan­dise value this year.</p>
    <p>LEAD­ING THE WAY</p>
    <p>South-east Asia’s grow­ing dig­i­tal econ­omy is cre­at­ing de­mand for a dig­i­tally skilled work­force. Sin­ga­pore has led the way in grow­ing its tal­ent pool through a gov­ern­ment and busi­ness ecosys­tem com­mit­ted to skilling Sin­ga­pore­ans for the op­por­tu­ni­ties that lie ahead.</p>
    <p>The clear signs of an e-com­merce boom in Sin­ga­pore failed to pre­vent its In­ter­net econ­omy – or busi­ness con­ducted on­line – from tak­ing a hit from the</p>
    <p>Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>On­line travel – Sin­ga­pore’s star dig­i­tal per­former last year – slumped by about 70 per cent this year to US$2 bil­lion (S$2.7 bil­lion) in gross mer­chan­dise value (GMV), stricken by lock­downs and travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>This con­trib­uted to a 24 per cent, or US$3 bil­lion, drop in the over­all In­ter­net econ­omy to US$9 bil­lion in GMV this year, ac­cord­ing to a re­port by Google, Te­masek and con­sult­ing firm Bain & Com­pany.</p>
    <p>The re­port struck a note of op­ti­mism, how­ever, say­ing Sin­ga­pore’s In­ter­net econ­omy is on track to reach US$22 bil­lion in GMV by 2025 as sec­tors se­verely dis­rupted by the pan­demic are ex­pected to re­bound.</p>
    <p>The an­nual e-Con­omy South­east Asia study, first pub­lished in 2016, cov­ers Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia, the Philip­pines, Thai­land, Viet­nam and In­done­sia. The lat­est was re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It looks at trends and data across seven In­ter­net econ­omy sec­tors: e-com­merce, trans­port and food, on­line travel, on­line me­dia, dig­i­tal fi­nan­cial ser­vices, and the newly added sec­tors of health tech­nol­ogy (healthtech) and ed­u­ca­tion tech­nol­ogy (edtech).</p>
    <p>Ex­clud­ing travel, Sin­ga­pore’s In­ter­net econ­omy grew 20 per cent to US$7.6 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Its e-com­merce sec­tor is the new leader, swelling by 87 per cent to US$4 bil­lion in GMV as more peo</p>

    <p>ple stayed home and made on­line pur­chases this year, al­though t his was not large enough to off­set the US$4 bil­lion de­cline in travel.</p>
    <p>Mr Aadarsh Bai­jal, part­ner and head of dig­i­tal prac­tice in South-east Asia at Bain & Com­pany, said Sin­ga­pore’s e-com­merce seg­ment has over­taken on­line travel and is ex­pected to grow over the next few years to be the largest sec­tor here.</p>
    <p>“Travel is ex­pected to re­cover, but in the next few years it will re­main muted, so sec­tors like e-com­merce will be­come larger,” he said.</p>
    <p>As ex­pected, peo­ple here are spend­ing more time on­line – 30 min­utes more com­pared with the pre-pan­demic’s 3.6 hours, the study found.</p>
    <p>Among the sec­tors cov­ered in the re­port, nearly a third (30 per cent) of all dig­i­tal ser­vice con­sumers in Sin­ga­pore were new to the ser­vice. More than nine in 10 of new con­sumers are ex­pected to con­tinue us­ing at least one dig­i­tal ser­vice even af­ter the pan­demic ends.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the trans­port and food sec­tor shrank 26 per cent to US$2 bil­lion this year as more peo­ple work from home and some shunned shared trans­porta­tion.</p>
    <p>With more time at home, peo­ple took to more videos, games and other prod­ucts, pro­pel­ling the on­line me­dia seg­ment by 24 per cent to US$1.8 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>They also gave a boost to dig­i­tal fi­nan­cial ser­vices, with more turn­ing to mo­bile bank­ing apps as well as robo-ad­vis­ers and on­line wealth man­age­ment plat­forms.</p>
    <p>The to­tal value of in­vest­ments in Sin­ga­pore’s In­ter­net econ­omy rose to US$2.5 bil­lion over 325 deals in the first half of the year, up from US$1.8 bil­lion in the sec­ond half of last year.</p>
    <p>The re­port noted that Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ues to be a re­gional hub for var­i­ous dig­i­tal econ­omy sec­tors such as fin­tech due to its strong start-up ecosys­tem. The city-state houses the re­gional head­quar­ters of e-com­merce uni­corns such as Lazada and Shopee owner Sea.</p>
    <p>Ms Stephanie Davis, Google’s vice-pres­i­dent for South-east Asia, said: “South-east Asia’s grow­ing dig­i­tal econ­omy is cre­at­ing de­mand for a dig­i­tally skilled work­force. Sin­ga­pore has led the way in grow­ing its tal­ent pool through a gov­ern­ment and busi­ness ecosys­tem com­mit­ted to skilling Sin­ga­pore­ans for the op­por­tu­ni­ties that lie ahead.”</p>
    <p>The re­port said South-east Asia’s In­ter­net econ­omy as a whole is set to ex­ceed US$300 bil­lion in GMV by 2025, fu­elled by e-com­merce and on­line me­dia con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>The nascent sec­tors of healthtech and edtech also played cru­cial roles in coun­tries across the re­gion, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of users on telemedici­ne plat­forms grew by four times, and these plat­forms re­tained users even af­ter lock­downs ended. Mean­while, the num­ber of stu­dents who in­stalled the top five edtech apps in South-east Asia in­creased by more than three times.</p>
