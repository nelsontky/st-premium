    <p>•</p>
    <p>WELLING­TON World No. 1 No­vak Djokovic has with­drawn from this month’s ATP Player Coun­cil elec­tions, cit­ing the gov­ern­ing body’s new rule that would make it a “con­flict of in­ter­est” be­cause of his role in the Pro­fes­sional Ten­nis Play­ers As­so­ci­a­tion (PTPA).</p>
    <p>The Serb set up the new break­away in­de­pen­dent play­ers’ union on the eve of the US Open in Septem­ber and re­signed as head of the player coun­cil.</p>
    <p>While he con­firmed last month he had been nom­i­nated by his fel­low pro­fes­sion­als for the cur­rent elec­tions, which he ac­cepted, the new ATP rule means he has had to with­draw.</p>
    <p>“My first re­ac­tion to this nom­i­na­tion was to ac­cept it with the in­ten­tion that, if elected, I would do my best to pro­tect play­ers’ in­ter­ests within the ATP,” Djokovic tweeted on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, a few days af­ter my nom­i­na­tion, the ATP passed a new rule which has put me in a dif­fi­cult po­si­tion. Un­for­tu­nately, given these lat­est de­vel­op­ments I feel it is now nec­es­sary to re­move my­self from the list of can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>“I do not wish to cre­ate con­flict or un­cer­tainty around the player elec­tions or cre­ate any is­sues that may arise.”</p>
    <p>He re­peated the as­ser­tions he made sev­eral times this year that the PTPA wanted to co-ex­ist with the sport’s gov­ern­ing bod­ies and had “no in­ten­tion of be­ing in con­flict”, but the ball was now in their court.</p>
    <p>“The PTPA has made it clear it does not in­tend to be com­bat­ive, it is un­clear how the ATP will view the as­so­ci­a­tion in the fu­ture,” the 17-time Ma­jor win­ner said.</p>
    <p>He added that the PTPA was still in the for­ma­tive stages but he was still keen to ad­vance it to fur­ther the in­ter­ests of all play­ers, es­pe­cially those in the lower ranks.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to form the PTPA blind­sided many play­ers, with record 20-time Grand Slam cham­pi­ons Roger Fed­erer and Rafael Nadal voic­ing their op­po­si­tion.</p>
