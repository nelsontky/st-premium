    <p>HOUS­TON • With the likes of James Har­den, John Wall and Eric Gor­don on their ros­ter, the Hous­ton Rock­ets will first and fore­most be known for what they gen­er­ate of­fen­sively on a game-by-game ba­sis.</p>
    <p>But if the Rock­ets are to dis­tin­guish them­selves from a crowded field of con­tenders in the Western Con­fer­ence, they must make head­way de­fen­sively.</p>
    <p>This Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) sea­son re­mains in its in­fancy, but Hous­ton have strug­gled to muster a de­fen­sive iden­tity and any cor­re­spond­ing suc­cess.</p>
    <p>Their de­fence was shred­ded to pieces by the Dal­las Mav­er­icks on Mon­day. To­day, Hous­ton will travel to face the In­di­ana Pac­ers, seek­ing con­ti­nu­ity on both ends of the court.</p>
    <p>“We have to do things to be dis­rup­tive on the de­fen­sive end, whether it’s be­ing a lit­tle bit more ag­gres­sive or re­bound­ing the ball so we can get out and run,” the Rock­ets’ rookie coach Stephen Si­las said.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­body wants to play faster, ev­ery­body wants to play with more pace. We’re not alone in that but we have to do cer­tain things in or­der for that to hap­pen.”</p>
    <p>The Rock­ets could cer­tainly stand to re­bound bet­ter. They rank 27th in re­bounds per game.</p>
    <p>But how they cor­ral op­po­nents de­fen­sively yields an even greater in­flu­ence on pos­i­tive re­sults. It is a chal­lenge the team are em­brac­ing.</p>
    <p>“It’s def­i­nitely a mind­set,” Rock­ets for­ward David Nwaba said. “You’ve got to take pride on the de­fen­sive end. And just go over film and what we need to work on. That’s what we’re go­ing to do.”</p>
    <p>The Pac­ers have their own rookie coach Nate Bjork­gren but un­like the Rock­ets, who are 12th in the West with a 2-3 record, they are off to a solid start in the East, plac­ing third at 5-2.</p>
    <p>Through seven games, In­di­ana rank in or near the top 10 in both of­fen­sive (sixth) and de­fen­sive (11th) ratings, a tell­tale sign of a cham­pi­onship con­tender.</p>
    <p>While none of the ex­perts are pre­dict­ing that the Pac­ers will go on to win their maiden ti­tle, they can at least aim to make it past the first round of the play-offs.</p>
    <p>In­di­ana have qual­i­fied for the post-sea­son for the last five years but have been knocked out each time. Un­der Bjork­gren, though, the team feel they can go one bet­ter.</p>
    <p>“We’ve got one of the best coaches in the league if not the best,” Pac­ers guard Mal­colm Brog­don said.</p>
    <p>“I’m go­ing to con­tinue to say that dur­ing the sea­son and make sure peo­ple un­der­stand how well­coached we are.</p>
    <p>“Nate puts ev­ery­body in a po­si­tion to play their game and show their strengths.”</p>
