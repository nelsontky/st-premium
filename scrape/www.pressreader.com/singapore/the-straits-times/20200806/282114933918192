    <p>Two res­i­dents of a flat in Com­pass­vale were mes­sag­ing some friends on What­sApp amid the Covid-19 out­break when one of them sug­gested hav­ing a so­cial gath­er­ing at the unit.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Leong Chee Mun, 37, and his fi­ancee, Cassie Ong Shi Hong, 32, agreed to host the event at their home on May 8 even though the cir­cuit breaker was still in force.</p>
    <p>They later had 16 peo­ple over at the unit at Block 295C Com­pass­vale Crescent, the court heard.</p>
    <p>Ten of them pleaded guilty yes­ter­day to an of­fence un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act. Each of them also had a sec­ond charge un­der the same Act that was taken into con­sid­er­a­tion dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>Jack­son Tan Chia Ho and Jas­min Tan Ee Lin, both 30, were each fined $3,000.</p>
    <p>Poh Yang Ting, 21, Peh Si Qin, 22, Felisa Chua Jia Xuan, 23, Low Wei Hao, 25, Nic­man Lim Wei Fong, 25, Chee Min Hui, 27, Kho Zi Ting, 27, and Priscilia Tan Sze Hui, 32, were each fined $2,500.</p>
    <p>The cases in­volv­ing Leong, Ong and six other peo­ple are pend­ing.</p>
    <p>From April 7 to June 1, mem­bers of the pub­lic were not al­lowed to leave their places of res­i­dence with­out a valid rea­son or meet other peo­ple not liv­ing in the same place for any so­cial pur­pose.</p>
    <p>De­spite this, Jack­son Tan and Jas­min Tan were in Leong and Ong’s flat since around 6am on May 8 as they had breakfast there, while the other guests turned up from around 9pm that night.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Lee Wei Liang said: “While in the unit, the group... min­gled and came into close con­tact with one an­other while do­ing var­i­ous ac­tiv­i­ties such as eat­ing, drink­ing al­co­holic bev­er­ages, play­ing games and watch­ing Net­flix pro­grammes.”</p>
    <p>A res­i­dent in the same block alerted the po­lice to the gath­er­ing at around 2am the next day, say­ing the ac­tiv­i­ties had been go­ing on al­most ev­ery night.</p>
    <p>A po­lice of­fi­cer, Sergeant Roy Tan, later ar­rived at the unit. When he rang the door­bell, he heard “hush­ing” noises com­ing from in­side. But no one opened the front door.</p>
    <p>The DPP said: “Sergeant Roy had to knock on the door and ring the door­bell nu­mer­ous times and wait for about three min­utes be­fore (Leong) fi­nally opened the door.</p>
    <p>“(Leong) in­formed Sergeant Roy that he was the owner of the unit, and that he had been sleep­ing. He also lied to Sergeant Roy that he and (Ong) were the only ones in the unit.”</p>
    <p>But the po­lice­man called his bluff and said he had heard noises com­ing from in­side the flat.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Leong fi­nally ad­mit­ted that there was a gath­er­ing and po­lice later found the guests in­side the flat.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, DPP Lee urged the court to sen­tence Jack­son Tan and Jas­min Tan to a fine of $3,000 each, stress­ing that they had stayed in the flat for a far greater du­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tor also urged the court to sen­tence the re­main­ing eight peo­ple to a fine of $2,500 each.</p>
    <p>For each charge un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act, a first-time of­fender can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to $10,000. A re­peat of­fender can be jailed for up to a year and fined up to $20,000.</p>
