    <p>For­mer doc­tor Ler Teck Siang, who was in­volved in the HIV registry data leak, took the stand on the sec­ond day of his trial yes­ter­day for not pro­vid­ing nar­cotics of­fi­cers with a sam­ple of his urine.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sent­ing him­self, Ler, 39, pressed on with his ar­gu­ment that he did not be­lieve of­fi­cers were giv­ing him a “le­gal order” to pro­vide the urine sam­ple after he was ar­rested for drug-re­lated of­fences on March 2, 2018.</p>
    <p>While at the Cen­tral Nar­cotics Bureau (CNB) of­fice in New Bridge Road, Ler said the of­fi­cers did not give him enough de­tails on pro­vid­ing a urine sam­ple, which gave him the im­pres­sion that he was not be­ing legally or­dered to do so.</p>
    <p>He said they did not pro­vide him with a time­frame of when he had to pro­vide the sam­ple, in­struct him on how much urine he should pro­vide, or a re­cep­ta­cle to do so.</p>
    <p>“The­o­ret­i­cally, I could have just pro­duced a drop of urine in my pants and that would have been pro­vid­ing urine,” said a shack­led Ler on the stand.</p>
    <p>In cross-ex­am­in­ing Ler, deputy pub­lic pros­e­cu­tors Dwayne Lum and Lu Yi­wei pointed out that the term “le­gal order” was miss­ing in var­i­ous state­ments taken by CNB of­fi­cers which Ler had wit­nessed and signed.</p>
    <p>DPP Lum added that both of­fi­cers who in­structed Ler to pro­vide a urine sam­ple also tes­ti­fied that there was no such con­ver­sa­tion where Ler asked for a le­gal order.</p>
    <p>DPP Lum as­serted that this re­quest was a “fab­ri­ca­tion”, say­ing to Ler: “The only ev­i­dence in this en­tire trial is your own as­ser­tion that you had re­quested a le­gal order.”</p>
    <p>Un­der the Mis­use of Drugs Act, it is an of­fence to fail to pro­vide a CNB of­fi­cer who rea­son­ably sus­pects any per­son to have com­mit­ted a drug-re­lated of­fence with a urine sam­ple with­out rea­son­able ex­cuse. The trial was ad­journed to Oct 15. Last Oc­to­ber, Ler was sen­tenced to 15 months’ jail for in­ject­ing drug abusers for a fee, and for pos­sess­ing drug uten­sils, after he was ar­rested with drug abuser Sim Eng Chee at the Conrad Cen­ten­nial ho­tel on March 2, 2018.</p>
    <p>Ho­tel staff called the au­thor­i­ties after they found drugs in Sim’s ho­tel room.</p>
    <p>Ler was struck off the med­i­cal reg­is­ter ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>He is cur­rently serv­ing a two-year sen­tence for help­ing his HIV-pos­i­tive for­mer part­ner, Amer­i­can Mikhy Far­rera-Brochez, cheat the au­thor­i­ties into is­su­ing him a work pass in 2008.</p>
    <p>In the HIV registry scan­dal last year, the de­tails of 14,200 HIV-pos­i­tive pa­tients were leaked on­line.</p>
    <p>Ler, who was head of the Na­tional Pub­lic Health Unit be­tween March 2012 and May 2013, also faces a charge un­der the Of­fi­cial Se­crets Act.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Mis­use of Drugs Act, it is an of­fence to fail to pro­vide a CNB of­fi­cer who rea­son­ably sus­pects any per­son to have com­mit­ted a drug-re­lated of­fence with a urine sam­ple with­out rea­son­able ex­cuse.</p>
