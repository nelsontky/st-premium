    <p>LONDON • Deaths from HIV, tu­ber­cu­lo­sis (TB) and malaria could surge in poor and mid­dle-in­come coun­tries as al­ready weak health sys­tems grap­ple with se­vere dis­rup­tions from the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>A pre­dic­tive study pub­lished on Mon­day shows that over the next five years, deaths from the three dis­eases could rise by as much as 10 per cent, 20 per cent and 36 per cent re­spec­tively – putting the mor­tal­ity im­pact on a scale sim­i­lar to the di­rect im­pact of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic it­self.</p>
    <p>“In coun­tries with a high malaria bur­den and large HIV and TB epi­demics, even short-term dis­rup­tions could have dev­as­tat­ing con­se­quences for the mil­lions of peo­ple who de­pend on pro­grammes to con­trol and treat these dis­eases,” said Pro­fes­sor Ti­mothy Hal­lett of Im­pe­rial Col­lege London who co-led the mod­el­ling study.</p>
    <p>He said the knock-on im­pact of Covid-19 could undo some of the sig­nif­i­cant progress against these dis­eases made over the past two decades, “com­pound­ing the bur­den caused by the pan­demic di­rectly”.</p>
    <p>But the risks could be mit­i­gated, Prof Hal­lett said, if coun­tries strive to main­tain core health ser­vices and de­ploy pre­ven­ta­tive mea­sures against in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Pub­lished in the Lancet Global Health jour­nal, the study – which used dis­ease-mod­el­ling pro­jec­tions to map out Covid-19 pan­demic sce­nar­ios – found that the great­est im­pact on HIV would be from in­ter­rup­tion to sup­plies of the an­tiretro­vi­ral Aids drugs taken by many pa­tients to keep the dis­ease in check.</p>
    <p>The United Na­tions Aids agency and the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion warned last week of such stock short­ages, with more than a third of the world’s coun­tries al­ready say­ing they are at risk of run­ning out of an­tiretro­vi­rals.</p>
    <p>With malaria, the study found the largest im­pact would be from dis­rupted dis­tri­bu­tion of in­sec­ti­cide­treated bed nets, which pro­tect mil­lions of peo­ple from be­com­ing in­fected by malaria-car­ry­ing mos­qui­toes.</p>
