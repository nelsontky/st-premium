    <p>Fancy spend­ing a day wan­der­ing in and out of book­stores?</p>
    <p>Olivia Ho rec­om­mends this book­shop walk that runs from Kam­pong Glam to Bukit Pa­soh. Bring comfy shoes and a sturdy book bag – though sev­eral book­shops would be happy to sell you the lat­ter 1</p>
    <p>Start at War­dah Books (58 Bus­so­rah Street, above) in Kam­pong Glam, an area that was once the heart of the Malay print­ing and pub­lish­ing scene. Nine­teen-year-old War­dah spe­cialises in books on Mus­lim is­sues, from the­o­log­i­cal texts to works about the Ro­hingya cri­sis.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>Pop into Books Ki­noku­niya Bugis Junc­tion</p>
    <p>(03-09 Bugis Junc­tion, 200 Vic­to­ria Street), a more com­pact ver­sion of the main Ngee Ann City out­let, with a ceil­ing based on the map of the sur­round­ing area.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>Wend your way down North Bridge Road to­wards</p>
    <p>City Book Room (03-10 North Bridge Cen­tre, 420 North Bridge Road), a cosy nook of Chi­nese lit­er­a­ture that pub­lishes the likes of Cul­tural Medal­lion re­cip­i­ent Yeng Pway Ngon. It also has a wide se­lec­tion of books by mi­grant worker writ­ers.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>Set aside plenty of time for Bras Basah Com­plex</p>
    <p>(231 Bain Street), the fa­bled City of Books that you could spend a whole af­ter­noon get­ting lost in, from the Pop­u­lar Pop@Cen­tral flag­ship (04-23/33) to the sec­ond­hand troves of Evernew Book Store (01-07) and Book Point (02-69).</p>
    <p>The com­plex is home to ven­er­a­ble Chi­nese-lan­guage book­stores such as Union Book Co (03-01), Maha Yu Yi (03-07/11) – which has both an adult sec­tion and a cheery chil­dren’s shop – and Xin­hua Cul­tural En­ter­prises (02-101), tucked away at the edge of the build­ing. If you are lucky, you may get to chat with Xin­hua founder Yeo Oi Sang, 81, a vet­eran of the Chi­nese book in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>At the top of the build­ing is Basheer Graphic Books (04-19, be­low), a war­ren of de­lights for the keen-eyed de­sign or ar­chi­tec­ture en­thu­si­ast. Born out of the suit­cases that its founder Basheer Ahamed car­ried door-to-door in the 1980s, to­day it stocks el­e­gant art books from pub­lish­ers like Phaidon and Taschen.</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>To con­tinue the trail to Chi­na­town, take bus ser­vices 51, 61, 63, 80, 145, 197 or 851 from op­po­site the National Li­brary to op­po­site Hong Lim Com­plex. This should take 10 min­utes. You can also walk down North Bridge and South Bridge roads for 25 min­utes.</p>
    <p>Grab a cof­fee or a hu­mor­ously named drink (Grape Ex­pec­ta­tions, any­one?) at The Moon (37 Mosque Street, above), where books by women and au­thors of colour are the star draw. Pick up a tarot deck or sign up for a guided med­i­ta­tion work­shop while you are there.</p>
    <p>If you are feel­ing peck­ish, head over to Huggs-Epi­gram Cof­fee Book­shop (01-01 The URA Cen­tre, 45 Maxwell Road, above) for its new set meal in­spired by Epi­gram’s cook­book Wet Mar­ket To Ta­ble by Pamelia Chia, which in­cludes fish with bor­lotti beans and snake gourd lemon cake. Huggs-Epi­gram is the only book­store to en­tirely sell books by Sin­ga­pore­ans, pub­lished in Sin­ga­pore or about Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>7</p>
    <p>In a quiet cor­ner of Dux­ton Hill is Lit­tered With Books (20 Dux­ton Road, above), where you can find Post-its on the shelves with rec­om­men­da­tions from the staff and a crime sec­tion up­stairs com­plete with a body out­line on the floor.</p>
    <p>8</p>
    <p>Wind down at Grass­roots Book Room (25 Bukit Pa­soh Road, above), a Chi­nese-lan­guage book­shop founded in 1975 and re­opened in 1995 by Yeng Pway Ngon and re­vived in 2014 by three of his fans. At in-house cafe Kata­sumi Koohii, you can tuck into cof­fee and cake with a book in hand – though do buy the book first.</p>
