    <p>BANGKOK • Thousands of high school stu­dents up­set about Thai­land’s lack­lus­tre ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem ral­lied along­side pro­test­ers dressed as danc­ing di­nosaurs in Bangkok yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It was the first mass gath­er­ing in the king­dom since Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha warned that the au­thor­i­ties would use all laws, in­clud­ing harsh royal defama­tion charges, to crack down on prodemoc­racy pro­test­ers.</p>
    <p>Since Au­gust, em­bold­ened by a broader po­lit­i­cal protest move­ment sweep­ing Thai­land, a group called the “Bad Stu­dents” has cam­paigned for the res­ig­na­tion of Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Nat­aphol Teep­suwan, de­manded cul­tural change, equal­ity, a cur­ricu­lum over­haul and re­lax­ation of strict rules.</p>
    <p>Ahead of yes­ter­day’s rally, three stu­dent lead­ers were sum­moned for po­lice ques­tion­ing and Thai Lawyers for Hu­man Rights said there were now four ju­ve­niles fac­ing po­ten­tial pros­e­cu­tion.</p>
    <p>But de­spite the threats, the youth re­mained de­fi­ant as they danced along­side half a dozen TRex char­ac­ters, rep­re­sent­ing Thai­land’s “po­lit­i­cal di­nosaurs”, and bounced around gi­ant “as­ter­oid” balls. “We have to come out and make our voices heard to force change,” Leaf, 15, told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>Many stu­dents wore coloured wrist­bands to in­di­cate they were un­der­age, so older pro­test­ers could pro­tect them.</p>
    <p>“School is not a safe place (for girls),” one stu­dent’s plac­ard said.</p>
    <p>Hun­dreds of pro­test­ers at the rally wore rub­ber duck hair clips, a ref­er­ence to pro-democ­racy pro­test­ers us­ing in­flat­able pool toys to shield them­selves from po­lice wa­ter can­non and tear gas last Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Many pro­test­ers were up­set that fam­i­lies have to fork out ex­tra money for tu­tor­ing be­cause of the poor qual­ity of teach­ing.</p>
    <p>“I spend so much for my daugh­ter’s tu­tor­ing fees and need to en­rol her in a far­away school so that she could get a good ed­u­ca­tion. It should not be like this,” said Ms Su­pa­porn Pra­tum­rat, 41, who at­tended the rally with her daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>Izzy, 18, went to the United States on a stu­dent ex­change last year and said stu­dents there were able to have fun and pur­sue their hob­bies af­ter school, but many Thai stu­dents do not have that lux­ury.</p>
    <p>“In Thai­land some stu­dents go to ex­tra classes from 4pm to 9pm,” he told AFP.</p>
    <p>Since July, Thai­land has been rocked by youth-led protests de­mand­ing a new Con­sti­tu­tion, mak­ing un­prece­dented calls to re­form the un­touch­able monar­chy, and for Mr Prayut, who came to power in a 2014 coup, to re­sign.</p>
    <p>Po­lice used tear gas and wa­ter can­non against pro­test­ers out­side Par­lia­ment last Tues­day and 55 peo­ple were in­jured, in­clud­ing six peo­ple shot dur­ing scuf­fles be­tween democ­racy ac­tivists and hard-line roy­al­ists.</p>
    <p>A day later pro­test­ers sprayed graf­fiti on the fa­cade of the na­tional po­lice head­quar­ters build­ing and threw paint at the com­plex.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment’s de­ci­sion to give po­lice the green light to pur­sue royal defama­tion charges against pro-democ­racy pro­test­ers is likely to in­crease ten­sions ahead of the next ma­jor rally sched­uled for Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“De­stroy­ing pub­lic prop­erty, un­prece­dented vi­o­la­tion of the monar­chy, I per­son­ally can­not ac­cept this,” Mr Prayut said on Fri­day night.</p>
    <p>In Thai­land, lese ma­jeste charges are rou­tinely in­ter­preted to in­clude any crit­i­cism of the monar­chy – in­clud­ing con­tent posted or shared on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Any­one con­victed of de­fam­ing, in­sult­ing or threat­en­ing the king, queen, heir or re­gent faces be­tween three years and 15 years in prison on each count.</p>
