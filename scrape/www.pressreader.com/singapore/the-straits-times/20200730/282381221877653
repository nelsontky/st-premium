    <p>SYD­NEY • Cross-code su­per­star Sonny Bill Wil­liams yes­ter­day con­firmed that he will re­turn to Aus­tralia’s Na­tional Rugby League with the Syd­ney Roost­ers af­ter Covid-19 forced his team, Toronto Wolf­pack, to with­draw from Eng­land’s Su­per League.</p>
    <p>Wil­liams, who has won two Rugby World Cups with the All Blacks and two NRL pre­mier­ships in Aus­tralia, said he would ar­rive in Syd­ney to­day and un­dergo two weeks’ manda­tory quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>“It’s just the chal­lenge that I get so ex­cited about, it lights that fire in­side of you,” he told Aus­tralia’s Chan­nel Nine be­fore depart­ing from Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Wil­liams, who will turn 35 next week, played with the Roost­ers in 2013 and 2014, win­ning a premier­ship in his first year, and said he had re­mained in con­tact with Roost­ers chair­man Nick Poli­tis.</p>
    <p>“Nick hit me up and asked if I had a cou­ple of months in me to come back,” he said. “To be hon­est, I hadn’t trained for a bit. I’d been on hol­i­day mode. We ac­tu­ally booked flights, me and my wife booked flights for a lit­tle fam­ily Euro­pean hol­i­day.”</p>
    <p>Wil­liams is still un­der con­tract with the Wolf­pack, who would nor­mally bar him from play­ing in the NRL, but the game’s hi­er­ar­chy bent the rules to al­low him in due to “ex­cep­tional cir­cum­stances”.</p>
    <p>The New Zealan­der also needed a spe­cial ex­emp­tion to fly into Syd­ney with his wife and chil­dren, as only Aus­tralian cit­i­zens are be­ing al­lowed in at the mo­ment. Once quar­an­tine is com­pleted, he could po­ten­tially take to the field for the Roost­ers’ round 15 match against Wests Tigers on Aug 22.</p>
    <p>He also rep­re­sented New Zealand in rugby sev­ens at the 2016 Rio Olympics and tri­umphed in all seven of his pro­fes­sional heavy­weight box­ing bouts, win­ning the New Zealand ti­tle in 2012.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic yes­ter­day claimed the first two events of the next World Rugby Sev­ens Se­ries sea­son, in Dubai and Cape Town.</p>
    <p>World Rugby said it was con­tin­u­ing to “fo­cus” on stag­ing the rest of the 2021 sev­ens sea­son, in­clud­ing the Sin­ga­pore leg in April. The 2019-20 se­ries was ended pre­ma­turely last month, with the men’s and women’s ti­tles both awarded to pace­set­ters New Zealand.</p>
