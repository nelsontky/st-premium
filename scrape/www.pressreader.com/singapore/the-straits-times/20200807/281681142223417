    <p>The Hong Kong gov­ern­ment said late last night that it would pro­vide free tests to for­eign helpers liv­ing in board­ing houses, af­ter an In­done­sian maid who stayed in two dor­mi­to­ries tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>An­other In­done­sian maid has also come out pos­i­tive in a pre­lim­i­nary test.</p>
    <p>Some 6,000 to 7,000 of the maids are now stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries while wait­ing for their visas, and at least one of the dozens who were in con­tact with the in­fected maids has since moved out to live with her em­ployer.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong Univer­sity’s in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert Ho Pak Le­ung yes­ter­day warned the gov­ern­ment not to un­der­es­ti­mate the risk of hav­ing mas­sive clus­ters at crowded board­ing houses, given Sin­ga­pore’s ex­pe­ri­ence with its for­eign worker pop­u­la­tion, and called for mass test­ing to be con­ducted on maids in dorms.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, health ex­perts pointed to re­laxed bor­der con­trols that al­lowed for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers to en­ter Hong Kong as a rea­son for lo­cal trans­mis­sions.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials are now rac­ing against time to track down at least 28 other do­mes­tic work­ers who came into con­tact with the In­done­sian woman who stayed at two board­ing houses – in Wan Chai and Cause­way Bay – last month.</p>
    <p>Dr Chuang Shuk Kwan, head of the com­mu­ni­ca­ble disease branch at the Cen­tre for Health Pro­tec­tion, said yes­ter­day that of­fi­cials had tracked down some of the maids, in­clud­ing one who had joined her em­ployer.</p>
    <p>“We need to ver­ify if they have been in touch with their em­ploy­ers. We first need to see if they them­selves are in­fected,” Dr Chuang said.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, the au­thor­i­ties said the In­done­sian woman had been job hunt­ing af­ter leav­ing her pre­vi­ous em­ployer on July 20.</p>
    <p>She de­vel­oped a fever on Aug 1. She first stayed at a North Point maid agency from July 20 to July 21, then at a Wan Chai dor­mi­tory in Lock­hart Road with 28 other do­mes­tic work­ers from July 21 to July 25, be­fore mov­ing to an agency – which dou­bles up as a dorm – at the Cause­way Bay Com­mer­cial Build­ing with four other do­mes­tic work­ers from July 30 to July 31.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties are still try­ing to find out where she was be­tween July 26 and July 29.</p>
    <p>Dr Chuang said the sec­ond In­done­sian maid, who tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, had stayed in a She­ung Wan build­ing last month with up to six other maids.</p>
    <p>She moved in with her new em­ployer on Aug 1 and was tested af­ter de­vel­op­ing a fever a few days later.</p>
    <p>Pres­sure is mount­ing on the au­thor­i­ties to con­tain the sit­u­a­tion, even as the main­land sent a sev­en­mem­ber med­i­cal team to help Hong Kong ramp up its test­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment yes­ter­day ex­tended for an­other week – till Aug 16 – work-from-home ar­range­ments for civil ser­vants as the third wave of in­fec­tions showed no signs of abat­ing af­ter over a month.</p>
    <p>This week, two wet mar­kets in the Kowloon City district were iden­ti­fied as clus­ters with about a dozen cases. Yes­ter­day, 95 new cases were con­firmed, bring­ing the to­tal tally in the city to 3,849, in­clud­ing 46 deaths. Of the new cases, 91 were lo­cal trans­mis­sions.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, the gov­ern­ment ex­tended so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures to next Tues­day. They were due to ex­pire on Wed­nes­day this week.</p>
    <p>The mea­sures in­clude com­pul­sory mask-wear­ing in in­door and out­door pub­lic spa­ces, as well as a cap of two peo­ple for pub­lic gath­er­ings. Busi­nesses such as gyms, cine­mas, bars and night­clubs will re­main shut for an­other week too.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials are now rac­ing against time to track down at least 28 other do­mes­tic work­ers who came into con­tact with the In­done­sian woman who stayed at two board­ing houses last month.</p>
