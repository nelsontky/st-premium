    <p>WILM­ING­TON • Mr Joe Bi­den has in­sisted that he will tackle the coro­n­avirus pan­demic from Day 1 if he is elected US pres­i­dent, but warned that there is no magic “switch” that ends it.</p>
    <p>The Demo­crat cast his pres­i­den­tial bal­lot in his home state of Delaware and met health ex­perts on Wed­nes­day as he fine-tuned his pan­demic re­sponse plan, seek­ing to re­as­sure vot­ers that he would use science to fight the con­ta­gion.</p>
    <p>“Even if I win it’s go­ing to take a lot of hard work to end this pan­demic,” the for­mer vice-pres­i­dent said in Wilm­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>“I’m not run­ning on a false prom­ise of be­ing able to end this pan­demic by flip­ping a switch. But what I can prom­ise you is this: We’ll start on Day 1 by do­ing the right thing. We’ll let science guide our de­ci­sions.”</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has upended all as­pects of Amer­i­can life and over­shad­owed the elec­tion, with opin­ion polls show­ing that it may well be Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s un­do­ing as cases of in­fec­tions hit record lev­els in the United States.</p>
    <p>De­spite many Amer­i­cans fear­ing the risk of vot­ing in crowded polling sta­tions, a re­mark­able 74.7 mil­lion peo­ple have al­ready cast their bal­lots.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s team an­nounced yes­ter­day that ex-pres­i­dent Barack Obama will join his for­mer right­hand man on the cam­paign trail in key state Michi­gan.</p>
    <p>It will be their first joint in-per­son ap­pear­ance of the 2020 race, and Mr Obama will no doubt re­peat his sear­ing at­tacks on Mr Trump’s han­dling of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Some 57.4 per cent of Amer­i­cans dis­ap­prove of Mr Trump’s coro­n­avirus re­sponse, while 39.8 per cent ap­prove, ac­cord­ing to a poll av­er­age com­piled by tracker FiveThir­tyEight.com.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, a Re­al­Clear­Pol­i­tics av­er­age shows 50 per cent ap­prove of Mr Trump’s han­dling of the econ­omy while 47.8 per cent do not.</p>
    <p>As polls re­peat­edly show Mr Bi­den lead­ing in the fi­nal week, the 77-year-old has gone on the of­fen­sive as he seeks to ex­pand his state-by-state path to vic­tory.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Mr Bi­den vis­ited Ge­or­gia, tra­di­tion­ally Repub­li­can ter­ri­tory, and he will also travel to Florida, Wis­con­sin and Michi­gan in the clos­ing days of the race. All are states that Mr Trump won in 2016 but which are up for grabs this year.</p>
    <p>On his cam­paign trail, Mr Bi­den blasted Pres­i­dent Trump, call­ing his ad­min­is­tra­tion’s re­sponse to the pan­demic “an in­sult to ev­ery sin­gle per­son suf­fer­ing from Covid-19 and ev­ery fam­ily who’s lost a loved one”.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, both Mr Trump and Mr Bi­den were sched­uled to rally sup­port­ers in the bat­tle­ground state of Florida, vis­it­ing the same city hours apart and putting on full dis­play once more their con­trast­ing ap­proaches to the resur­gent pan­demic.</p>
