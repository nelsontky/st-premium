    <p>About 32,000 work­ers in Sin­ga­pore take home less than the Work­ers’ Party’s (WP) pro­posed min­i­mum wage of $1,300, NTUC deputy sec­re­tary-gen­eral Koh Poh Koon told the House. This drew a re­sponse from WP MPs, who said its in­tro­duc­tion should then not hurt busi­nesses or work­ers.</p>
    <p>Dr Koh had cited the fig­ure to ex­plain that a min­i­mum wage was not nec­es­sary. He said the Gov­ern­ment’s poli­cies, par­tic­u­larly the pro­gres­sive wage model (PWM) and Work­fare In­come Sup­ple­ment, al­ready en­sure the ma­jor­ity of low-wage work­ers take home more than $1,300 a month.</p>
    <p>Among the 850,000 work­ers in oc­cu­pa­tions tra­di­tion­ally deemed lower in­come, such as cler­i­cal sup­port and ser­vice staff and trades­men, about 100,000 earn be­low $1,300, fig­ures from the Min­istry of Man­power show.</p>
    <p>After tak­ing into ac­count Work­fare wage top-ups and em­ploy­ers’ Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund con­tri­bu­tion, about 56,000 earn less than $1,300. Of these, about 32,000 are full-time em­ploy­ees, or 1.7 per cent of the work­force, a “very small num­ber”, said Dr Koh.</p>
    <p>Not­ing this, Leader of the Op­po­si­tion Pri­tam Singh said there should then be no dif­fi­culty in en­sur­ing that all Sin­ga­pore­ans are paid a live­able wage. He added he was pre­pared to work with the Gov­ern­ment to make it hap­pen in “dou­ble-quick time”, as it was un­ac­cept­able for any Sin­ga­porean to be earn­ing be­low $1,300.</p>
    <p>Dr Koh had sug­gested that in­tro­duc­ing a min­i­mum wage now was in­con­sis­tent with what WP MPs have said about help­ing small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) amid the re­ces­sion, and would be akin to adding “more frost to the snow in com­pa­nies that are in deep win­ter right now”.</p>
    <p>Mr Ed­ward Chia (Hol­land-Bukit Timah GRC), a co-founder of Tim­bre Group, said firms fac­ing cost pres­sures could re­place work­ers with tech­nol­ogy, with “low-wage be­com­ing no-wage”.</p>
    <p>But Mr Leon Per­era (Alju­nied GRC) ques­tioned how a min­i­mum wage would hurt SMEs, given that the Gov­ern­ment be­lieves 32,000 to be a small num­ber. He added that many busi­ness own­ers have ex­pressed that they “want to pay their em­ploy­ees with dig­nity”.</p>
    <p>He asked how long it would take to roll out the PWM to all sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Dr Koh said the process would start now, but when it would kick in would de­pend on the eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion. The Gov­ern­ment is not ide­o­log­i­cally against a min­i­mum wage, he said, adding that the PWM is ef­fec­tively one tied to a skills lad­der, which takes a dif­fer­ent ap­proach to lift­ing wages.</p>
    <p>He also said that al­though it now cov­ers only the clean­ing, se­cu­rity and land­scape sec­tors, the PWM has helped lift wages in other sec­tors. Dr Koh pointed to the new work group on ex­pand­ing the PWM, say­ing this would fur­ther re­duce the 32,000 fig­ure.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh said his re­cent Face­book post on the is­sue was not to dis­miss the PWM model, but to nudge the Gov­ern­ment to move faster on those low-wage work­ers at the lower end of the spec­trum.</p>
