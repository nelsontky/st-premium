    <p>Will Sin­ga­pore sink like the Ti­tanic?</p>
    <p>When the Bri­tish lux­ury pas­sen­ger liner Ti­tanic em­barked on its maiden jour­ney in 1912, it was an en­gi­neer­ing marvel of its time. Yet, it struck an ice­berg and sank, killing over 1,500 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Work­ers’ Party MP Leon Per­era (Alju­nied GRC) used the ex­am­ple to draw a metaphor, warn­ing against com­pla­cency when as­sess­ing Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy, which has been billed to be “bril­liantly en­gi­neered and painstak­ingly main­tained through sound pol­icy” .</p>
    <p>The lack of func­tion­ing lifeboats on the Ti­tanic con­trib­uted to the dis­as­ter, he noted, warn­ing that in­suf­fi­cient so­cial safety nets will un­der­mine the con­fi­dence and peace of mind of Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for De­fence Heng Chee How, who is NTUC deputy sec­re­tary-gen­eral, was more op­ti­mistic.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is aware that its econ­omy is one that is con­stantly chang­ing, which is why the Govern­ment has rolled out in­dus­try trans­for­ma­tion maps to adapt to the chang­ing needs of the econ­omy, he said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy is un­like the Ti­tanic, a one-time in­ven­tion “used un­til it (fell) apart”, said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>“We know we have to trans­form. In fact, (this trans­for­ma­tion) is not fast enough, and that is our worry...</p>
    <p>“So, in that sense, we are not the Ti­tanic.”</p>
