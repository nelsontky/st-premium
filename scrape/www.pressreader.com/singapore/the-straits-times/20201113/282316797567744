    <p>Croa­tia de­fender Do­magoj Vida played the open­ing half of their 3-3 friendly draw with Turkey on Wed­nes­day be­fore the team re­ceived the i nfor­ma­tion that he had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, the coun­try’s foot­ball as­so­ci­a­tion con­firmed in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>All Croa­tia play­ers, in­clud­ing Be­sik­tas cen­tre-back Vida, had re­turned neg­a­tive tests on Mon­day and un­der­went an­other rou­tine test on Wed­nes­day morn­ing ahead of the Turkey game in Is­tan­bul, with a Na­tions League match against Swe­den sched­uled for to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>The ex­pe­ri­enced Vida started the game as Croa­tia’s cap­tain, giv­ing away a penalty in the first half.</p>
    <p>The team were ini­tially in­formed of a po­ten­tially pos­i­tive coro­n­avirus re­sult shortly be­fore the sec­ond half of the clash, by which time coach Zlatko Dalic had al­ready brought on Filip Ure­movic in place of Vida.</p>
    <p>Vida, 31, was im­me­di­ately iso­lated from the squad be­fore a retest con­firmed his pos­i­tive re­sult.</p>
    <p>Croa­tia said he will spend the next few days in self-iso­la­tion in Is­tan­bul, home of his club Be­sik­tas, while the team travel to Stock­holm.</p>
    <p>Croa­tia added that an­other mem­ber of their del­e­ga­tion had tested pos­i­tive but was not in con­tact with the team or staff.</p>
    <p>Af­ter to­mor­row’s sched­uled visit to Swe­den, Croa­tia are due to face Por­tu­gal at home on Tues­day in Group 3 of Na­tions League A.</p>
    <p>In an­other friendly, Vin­cenzo Grifo scored his first two in­ter­na­tional goals at the age of 27 to help a makeshift Italy side, miss­ing coach Roberto Mancini due to a Covid-19 in­fec­tion, to a 4-0 win over Es­to­nia.</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant coach Al­berico Evani took charge of the side while Mancini passed in­struc­tions from his home in Rome, where the 55-year-old is self-iso­lat­ing.</p>
    <p>Italy, who ex­tended their un­beaten run to 20 games, had called up a 41-man squad for the match and Na­tions Leagues games against Poland and Bos­nia, us­ing the game to give a run-out to less ex­pe­ri­enced play­ers.</p>
    <p>“It was a game where we had ev­ery­thing to lose but we did what we needed to do,” Evani said.</p>
    <p>“We tried to play, but we learned a few things and there is an ex­tra­or­di­nary hu­man qual­ity in this squad.”</p>
