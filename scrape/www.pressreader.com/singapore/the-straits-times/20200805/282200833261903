    <p>KOLKATA • BlackRock and Sin­ga­pore’s sov­er­eign wealth fund GIC bought shares in Bandhan Bank as the main share­holder of In­dia’s most prof­itable bank sold 106 bil­lion ru­pees (S$1.9 bil­lion) of its stake to meet the reg­u­la­tor’s own­er­ship rules.</p>
    <p>Temasek and SBI Mu­tual Fund also bought shares, the bank’s founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive Chan­dra Shekhar Ghosh said in an in­ter­view. GIC re­ceived the Re­serve Bank of In­dia’s (RBI) ap­proval to raise its stake in the lender to 10 per cent from 4.9 per cent, he said.</p>
    <p>Bandhan Fi­nan­cial Hold­ings sold 337.4 mil­lion shares in the In­dian lender at 313.1 ru­pees in a block trade on Mon­day, a 9.3 per cent dis­count to the last clos­ing price, ac­cord­ing to deal terms seen by Bloomberg News.</p>
    <p>Bandhan Bank’s shares plunged 10.5 per cent to 308.8 ru­pees in Mum­bai af­ter the trans­ac­tion, its big­gest loss since March 30.</p>
    <p>The cen­tral bank re­stricted branch ex­pan­sion by Bandhan Bank, which spe­cialises in lend­ing to small bor­row­ers, af­ter the found­ing firm failed to lower its stake to 40 per cent last year.</p>
    <p>Bandhan Bank then agreed to com­bine with mort­gage fi­nancier Gruh Fi­nance in a US$11.7 bil­lion (S$16.1 bil­lion) deal to pare the founder’s stake as man­dated, af­ter which the cen­tral bank par­tially re­laxed its curbs on the lender.</p>
    <p>Mr Karthik Srini­vasan, group head of fi­nan­cial sec­tor rat­ings at ICRA, the lo­cal arm of credit as­ses­sor Moody’s In­vestors Ser­vice, said: “RBI is very clear that share­hold­ing in pri­vate banks should be diver­si­fied as it re­duces con­cen­tra­tion risk.</p>
    <p>“The ur­gency of stake sale by Bandhan founders shows that RBI is on track on its rules re­gard­ing share­hold­ing in pri­vate banks.”</p>
    <p>The cen­tral bank is re­view­ing its norms on share­hold­ing in pri­vate banks, which stip­u­late founders cut their stake to 15 per cent even­tu­ally, as it aims to im­prove cor­po­rate gov­er­nance. Mr Ghosh, cit­ing RBI rules, said that af­ter the lat­est sale, the founders will need to lower their stake to 20 per cent by Au­gust 2023.</p>
    <p>Bandhan Fi­nan­cial Hold­ings’ share­hold­ers, which in­clude GIC, In­ter­na­tional Fi­nance Corp and Mr Ghosh, plan to use the pro­ceeds to start new ven­tures such as in­sur­ance and as­set man­age­ment, sub­ject to RBI’s ap­proval, Mr Ghosh said.</p>
    <p>Some of Bandhan Bank’s prof­itabil­ity met­rics, in­clud­ing re­turn on as­sets and re­turn on eq­uity, are the high­est among In­dian banks.</p>
    <p>Credit Suisse Se­cu­ri­ties (In­dia), JPMor­gan In­dia, Gold­man Sachs (In­dia) Se­cu­ri­ties and JM Fi­nan­cial In­sti­tu­tional Se­cu­ri­ties are joint bookrun­ners for the deal.</p>
