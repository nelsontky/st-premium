    <p>Con­gres­sional Democrats have ac­cused US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump of in­cit­ing in­sur­rec­tion and weighed up im­peach­ing him for a sec­ond time af­ter sup­port­ers fired up by his false claims of elec­tion fraud stormed the US Capi­tol this week.</p>
    <p>US House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Se­nate Mi­nor­ity Leader Chuck Schumer called on Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence and Mr Trump’s Cab­i­net to in­voke the Con­sti­tu­tion’s 25th Amend­ment, which al­lows them to strip the Pres­i­dent of his pow­ers if he can­not dis­charge his du­ties. But Mr Pence op­poses the idea.</p>
    <p>As the fall-out con­tin­ues, Mr Trump ap­pears to have con­ceded the Nov 3 elec­tion. He has said he will not at­tend Pres­i­dent-elect Joe</p>
    <p>Bi­den’s in­au­gu­ra­tion on Jan 20.</p>
    <p>At least 55 peo­ple have been charged over the un­rest, which led to the death of five peo­ple, in­clud­ing a po­lice of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>Fac­ing calls for his re­moval fol­low­ing the storm­ing of the US Capi­tol on Wed­nes­day by a mob of his sup­port­ers, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump on Thurs­day evening called for calm and, for the first time, ap­peared to con­cede the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Re­turn­ing to Twit­ter af­ter be­ing banned for 12 hours by the plat­form, Mr Trump said in a video mes­sage: “Like all Amer­i­cans, I am out­raged by the vi­o­lence, law­less­ness and may­hem.</p>
    <p>“We have just been through an in­tense elec­tion and emo­tions are high. But now, tem­pers must be cooled and calm re­stored.”</p>
    <p>“A new ad­min­is­tra­tion will be in­au­gu­rated on Jan 20,” he added. “My fo­cus now turns to en­sur­ing a smooth, or­derly and seam­less tran­si­tion of power. This mo­ment calls for heal­ing and rec­on­cil­i­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>He went on to say: “And to all of my won­der­ful sup­port­ers, I know you are dis­ap­pointed, but I also want you to know that our in­cred­i­ble jour­ney is only just be­gin­ning.”</p>
    <p>As in­ves­ti­ga­tors be­gan piec­ing to­gether de­tails on the un­prece­dented storm­ing of the Capi­tol while Congress was in a joint ses­sion to count Elec­toral Col­lege votes, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called on Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence to in­voke the 25th Amend­ment.</p>
    <p>The pro­vi­sion is nor­mally used to tem­po­rar­ily trans­fer power to the vice-pres­i­dent while a pres­i­dent un­der­goes, say, a sur­gi­cal pro­ce­dure.</p>
    <p>The Vice-Pres­i­dent will not do so, The New York Times re­ported yes­ter­day, cit­ing a source close to Mr Pence.</p>
    <p>Cab­i­net of­fi­cials are said to be wor­ried that do­ing so will in­flame the sit­u­a­tion fur­ther.</p>
    <p>If Mr Pence does not in­voke this pro­vi­sion, Congress may be pre­pared to im­peach the Pres­i­dent a sec­ond time, Ms Pelosi said. The House im­peached Mr Trump in 2019, but the Repub­li­can ma­jor­ity in the Se­nate ac­quit­ted him.</p>
    <p>“The Pres­i­dent of the United States in­cited an armed in­sur­rec­tion against Amer­ica,” Ms Pelosi told a news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“In call­ing for this sedi­tious act, the Pres­i­dent has com­mit­ted an un­speak­able as­sault on our na­tion and our peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, in a blis­ter­ing speech while re­veal­ing his Jus­tice Depart­ment ap­pointees, Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den flayed Mr Trump, say­ing that the storm­ing of the Capi­tol was “an un­prece­dented as­sault on our democ­racy”.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den called the mob “in­sur­rec­tion­ists” and “do­mes­tic ter­ror­ists”. He said: “I wish we could say we couldn’t see it com­ing. But that isn’t true. We could.</p>
    <p>“For the past four years, we have had a pres­i­dent who has made his con­tempt for our democ­racy, our Con­sti­tu­tion and the rule of law clear in ev­ery­thing he has done.</p>
    <p>“He has un­leashed an all-out as­sault on the in­sti­tu­tions of our democ­racy. And yes­ter­day was but the cul­mi­na­tion of that un­re­lent­ing at­tack.”</p>
    <p>Congressma­n Adam Kinzinger of Illi­nois be­came the first Repub­li­can law­maker to call for in­vok­ing the Con­sti­tu­tion’s 25th Amend­ment mech­a­nism.</p>
    <p>“Here is the truth: The Pres­i­dent caused this,” he said in a video state­ment. “The Pres­i­dent is un­fit and... un­well. And the Pres­i­dent now must re­lin­quish con­trol of the ex­ec­u­tive branch vol­un­tar­ily or in­vol­un­tar­ily.”</p>
    <p>The 25th Amend­ment has never been used to re­move a pres­i­dent from of­fice against his will.</p>
    <p>The Cab­i­net – now mi­nus two of its mem­bers, with the res­ig­na­tions this week of Trans­port Sec­re­tary Elaine Chao and Ed­u­ca­tion Sec­re­tary Betsy DeVos – would have to de­ter­mine whether to in­voke the pro­vi­sion. And the Pres­i­dent can chal­lenge it.</p>
    <p>As for im­peach­ment, with only days left in of­fice for Mr Trump, it may be pos­si­ble to hold de­bates and a vote in the House, but there may not be time to do the same in the Se­nate.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts are warn­ing that the US is in a highly volatile phase.</p>
    <p>At a brief­ing by the Na­tional Task Force on Elec­tion Crises, a net­work of law and se­cu­rity spe­cial­ists, Dr Rachel Kle­in­feld, se­nior fel­low of the Carnegie En­dow­ment for In­ter­na­tional Peace, said: “What we are deal­ing with... is a well-known facet of far weaker democ­ra­cies, which is a per­sonal army that a politi­cian has cul­ti­vated, which he uses to threaten op­po­nents.”</p>
    <p>More right-wing ral­lies are sched­uled in Wash­ing­ton and some state cap­i­tals in the com­ing days, in­clud­ing on In­au­gu­ra­tion Day.</p>
    <p>Right-wing groups see the storm­ing of the Capi­tol as “a gi­gan­tic tri­umph for their move­ment, a re­cruit­ing tool and a fund-rais­ing tool, sug­gest­ing that... up­com­ing events are go­ing to be larger”, Dr Kle­in­feld said.</p>
    <p>“So, I think we have real wor­ries, par­tic­u­larly around our in­au­gu­ra­tion for... Pres­i­dent-elect Bi­den.”</p>
    <p>“We are in a very frag­ile and vul­ner­a­ble time for our coun­try,” she warned.</p>
    <p>The US has charged 55 peo­ple with crimes stem­ming from the siege of the Capi­tol, while po­lice in Wash­ing­ton are con­duct­ing their own in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
