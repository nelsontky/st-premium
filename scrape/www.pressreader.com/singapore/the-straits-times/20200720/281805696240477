    <p>A 3D-printed face mask that is cus­tomised to your face shape and skin con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>An elec­tronic cleanser that uses ul­tra­sonic waves to clean your face.</p>
    <p>And LED de­vices that pro­vide colour light ther­apy – blue to kill acne-caus­ing bac­te­ria, red to re­duce wrin­kles and yel­low to soothe sen­si­tive skin – for your face and neck.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s beauty in­dus­try has gone high tech, with more in­no­va­tive skin­care prod­ucts and home-use de­vices emerg­ing from the land of K-pop stars with flaw­less skin, in line with a global trend.</p>
    <p>With the coro­n­avirus pan­demic keep­ing peo­ple at home, the de­mand for skin­care gad­gets mim­ick­ing sa­lon-use prod­ucts has risen.</p>
    <p>French beauty gi­ant L’Oreal, the world’s largest cos­met­ics maker, sig­nalled a shift to­wards high-tech ser­vices in 2018 with its ac­qui­si­tion of Cana­dian start-up Mod­i­face, which de­vel­ops aug­mented re­al­ity beauty apps.</p>
    <p>Early last year, it launched a skin di­ag­nos­tic tool en­abled by ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) that can eval­u­ate a per­son’s skin con­di­tions based on up­loaded self­ies, and of­fer per­son­alised prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s Shi­seido fol­lowed suit, re­leas­ing its skin­care sys­tem Op­tune which lever­ages In­ter­net of Things tech­nol­ogy and AI to an­a­lyse a per­son’s skin, com­bined with the user’s in­put on fac­tors such as men­strual cy­cle and air qual­ity.</p>
    <p>It will then rec­om­mend cus­tomised serums or lo­tions – tar­get­ing a grow­ing num­ber of cus­tomers who do not have enough time to try all kinds of prod­ucts to find some­thing suit­able.</p>
    <p>The beauty in­dus­try is in­creas­ingly be­com­ing tech-en­abled, mar­ket data re­search firm CB In­sights said in a re­port last year.</p>
    <p>It added that tech­nolo­gies such as AI and 3D print­ing will “con­tinue to make the beauty prod­uct life cy­cle more ef­fi­cient and per­son­alised for con­sumers”.</p>
    <p>In South Korea, beauty gi­ant Amorepa­cific launched the coun­try’s first 3D-printed face mask un­der the brand Iope in April.</p>
    <p>While Amer­ica’s Neu­tro­gena was the first to un­veil early last year the maskiD app which scans the user’s face to print a per­son­alised, cus­tom-fit hy­dro­gel mask, Iope ups the ante by throw­ing in a ge­net­ics kit that analy­ses 26 genes to fur­ther cus­tomise the skin­care solution.</p>
    <p>Mr Ai­den Park, head of Amorepa­cific’s ba­sic re­search and in­no­va­tion di­vi­sion, said it com­bines ad­vanced tech­nolo­gies with its beauty re­search to cre­ate new so­lu­tions that “can truly make a dif­fer­ence for our cus­tomers”.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, LED colour light ther­apy has walked out of der­ma­tol­ogy clin­ics into homes and is gain­ing rapid pop­u­lar­ity as more com­pa­nies jump onto the band­wagon and en­gage top stars in­clud­ing ac­tor Lee Min-ho and ac­tress Song Hyekyo to sell their prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Start-up firm Cell­re­turn de­vel­oped the first LED face mask in</p>
    <p>South Korea in 2014, in­cor­po­rat­ing AI, big data and wire­less touch tech­nol­ogy. The com­pany has since ex­panded its prod­uct line-up to in­clude a neck-care de­vice and a hair growth de­vice.</p>
    <p>Tech gi­ant LG has also in­creased its lineup of Pra.L beauty gad­gets – from an LED mask to a face mas­sag­ing de­vice and a cleanser that cleans us­ing ul­tra­sonic waves.</p>
    <p>Not to be out­done, Amorepa­cific’s beauty de­vices brand MakeOn has also di­ver­si­fied its prod­uct range. Its lat­est in­no­va­tions in­clude the stick-on LED Face Patch that ad­justs to curves on the face and pro­vides in­ten­sive firm­ing care, as well as the Mag­netight Body Roller that har­nesses the power of mag­nets to boost the ef­fects of body mas­sage.</p>
    <p>Its best­seller, how­ever, is the Skin Light Ther­apy de­vice that prom­ises to im­prove skin elas­tic­ity and mois­ture. Sales of the de­vice have in­creased about 300 per cent, ac­cord­ing to Amorepa­cific.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the com­pany said the high price of beauty gad­gets used to be a hur­dle for many cus­tomers, but “our de­vices have gone vi­ral as they are per­ceived as cost-ef­fec­tive in the long run”, es­pe­cially dur­ing the coro­n­avirus era when con­sumers pre­fer to do their beauty treat­ments at home.</p>
    <p>The Skin Light Ther­apy costs about 200,000 won (S$230).</p>
    <p>The spokesman added that LED de­vices have led the mar­ket to date, but other tech­nolo­gies such as ul­tra­sonic waves and mi­cro-cur­rent are also emerg­ing.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s do­mes­tic mar­ket for home-use beauty de­vices grew to about 500 bil­lion won (S$577.5 mil­lion) last year and is ex­pected to hit 1.6 tril­lion won by 2022.</p>
    <p>The global mar­ket was worth US$47.4 bil­lion (S$66 bil­lion) last year and is ex­pected to grow at 19.7 per cent an­nu­ally, ac­cord­ing to P&S Mar­ket Re­search.</p>
    <p>Con­sumer an­a­lyst An­chal Bisht at the an­a­lyt­ics firm Glob­alData said ris­ing beauty aware­ness among Kore­ans, es­pe­cially the so­cial me­dia-savvy younger work­ing gen­er­a­tion, is re­sult­ing in grow­ing de­mand for in­no­va­tive beauty prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>The ef­fec­tive­ness of LED light ther­apy, how­ever, is de­bat­able, judg­ing by re­views.</p>
    <p>Beauty YouTu­ber GJJB said the LED mask is con­ve­nient to use at home and fits all face sizes. But while her friends found it ef­fec­tive, she could not see any no­tice­able dif­fer­ence or in­crease in elas­tic­ity after us­ing it.</p>
    <p>Added YouTu­ber Dani: “It is hard to see dra­matic re­sults as it is a home-use beauty de­vice, not a med­i­cal prod­uct. Skin im­prove­ment may come in the long term, not im­me­di­ately.”</p>
    <p>South Korea’s do­mes­tic mar­ket for home-use beauty de­vices grew to about 500 bil­lion won (S$577.5 mil­lion) last year and is ex­pected to hit 1.6 tril­lion won by 2022.</p>
    <p>LED colour light ther­apy has walked out of der­ma­tol­ogy clin­ics into homes and is gain­ing more pop­u­lar­ity these days... Amorepa­cific’s best­seller is the Skin Light Ther­apy de­vice that prom­ises to im­prove skin elas­tic­ity and mois­ture. Sales of the de­vice have in­creased about 300 per cent, ac­cord­ing to Amorepa­cific.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has up­ended lo­gis­tics world­wide... One solution sur­faced this month, when Thai­land be­gan a two-mode sys­tem by truck­ing prod­ucts to Viet­nam, then mov­ing the goods into con­tain­ers on trains, which com­plete the de­liv­er­ies to China.</p>
