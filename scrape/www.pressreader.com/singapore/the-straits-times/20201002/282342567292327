    <p>In 2018, when KLA Sin­ga­pore de­cided to regis­ter for The Straits Times Run as a cor­po­rate en­try for the first time, coun­try pres­i­dent Theo Kneep­kens used to have to send re­minders to en­cour­age his staff to sign up.</p>
    <p>But since then, the ST Run has be­come an event that staff, fam­ily mem­bers and cus­tomers of the semi­con­duc­tor sys­tems com­pany look for­ward to.</p>
    <p>This year, KLA Sin­ga­pore, the lo­cal arm of Amer­i­can com­pany KLA Cor­po­ra­tion, will be send­ing its big­gest con­tin­gent of 817 par­tic­i­pants for the run, which will be held as a vir­tual race due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Kneep­kens said: “I ac­tu­ally feel that in ear­lier years, we were en­cour­ag­ing peo­ple more.</p>
    <p>“I think it has be­come so much of a yearly event that peo­ple are look­ing out for it.”</p>
    <p>The 52-year-old added that some might have been en­cour­aged to sign up for The Straits Times Vir­tual Run (STVR) this year be­cause of its flex­i­ble for­mat, which al­lows them to com­plete var­i­ous dis­tances in their own time and at their own pace.</p>
    <p>Of KLA Sin­ga­pore’s 817 par­tic­i­pants, 310 have signed up for the 175km cat­e­gory while 507 will be tack­ling the 17.5km race.</p>
    <p>The race pe­riod for the 17.5km cat­e­gory is Oct 9-18, while that of the 175km is Oct 19-Dec 17.</p>
    <p>Even with the can­cel­la­tion of tra­di­tional mass par­tic­i­pa­tion events due to the pan­demic, Kneep­kens wanted to con­tinue with the com­pany’s an­nual tra­di­tion of tak­ing part in mass runs as a cor­po­rate group­ing.</p>
    <p>He said: “Many peo­ple say that we are maybe more stressed out by work than we were be­fore so I feel ex­er­cis­ing is a way to work on health, both phys­i­cally as well as men­tally, and this helps to en­cour­age peo­ple to ex­er­cise and do it.”</p>
    <p>First-time par­tic­i­pant Vicky Wang, who j oined the com­pany last month, sees the STVR as a step­ping stone to­wards her goal of com­plet­ing her first marathon.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a two-year break from run­ning be­cause of a back strain, the man­u­fac­tur­ing de­sign en­gi­neer picked up the sport again dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, when gyms were closed.</p>
    <p>She started off with 1.5km runs and can now com­plete a 10km run.</p>
    <p>The 29-year-old said: “I en­joy hav­ing a goal, then slowly im­prov­ing to achieve it.</p>
    <p>“Now I keep run­ning and when marathons can fi­nally re­sume, hope­fully I can do a half-marathon or full marathon.”</p>
    <p>The at­mos­phere of this year’s run will be dif­fer­ent as staff will run re­motely, but the or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee has come up with ways to make staff feel con­nected.</p>
    <p>One such ini­tia­tive is the cre­ation of a mon­tage of par­tic­i­pants’ pic­tures that will even­tu­ally spell “KLA”.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee mem­ber Fred­er­ick Tang, 69, said: “You won’t be com­ing i n (with col­leagues) on the day so it’s a bit toned down but I think it’s a good ex­pe­ri­ence to have a vir­tual run.”</p>
