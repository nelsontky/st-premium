    <p>FIC­TION</p>
    <p>Jeong You-jeong is in­dis­putably South Korea’s queen of crime thrillers and she lives up to this billing in Seven Years Of Dark­ness.</p>
    <p>The at­mo­spheric noir thriller, her third of five nov­els to date and the se­cond to be trans­lated into English, was orig­i­nally pub­lished in Korean in 2011.</p>
    <p>It is trans­lated by Kim Chi-young, who had also trans­lated Jeong’s The Good Son (2019), a story about a psy­chopath which is by far one of the most dis­turb­ing nov­els this reviewer has read.</p>
    <p>Jeong’s writ­ing like­wise packs a punch in Seven Years Of Dark­ness.</p>
    <p>She wields a deft hand in nav­i­gat­ing such dark themes as do­mes­tic vi­o­lence, child abuse, an­i­mal abuse, al­co­holism, in­equal­ity and the psy­cho­log­i­cal trauma of hav­ing one’s life­long dreams shat­tered.</p>
    <p>The book starts with a tragedy at the fic­tional Sery­ong Lake seven years ago, in which Choi Hyonsu, a failed base­ball ath­lete turned head of se­cu­rity at the dam, opened the flood­gates and drowned the whole vil­lage.</p>
    <p>His mo­tives had never been clear to his son Sowon, now 18, whose ad­mi­ra­tion for his fa­ther has turned into ha­tred, as he is os­tracised by oth­ers for be­ing as­so­ci­ated with a crook on death row.</p>
    <p>The past he has tried to bury keeps re­turn­ing to haunt him – the work of re­lent­less pa­parazzi or per­haps some­thing more sin­is­ter.</p>
    <p>What had set off the se­ries of un­for­tu­nate events was the death of 11-year-old Oh Sery­ong in a hi­tand-run ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Her fa­ther Yongje, a den­tist and so­ciopath who had beaten her un­til her teeth fell out on the night of her death, plots his re­venge against the cul­prit be­hind his daugh­ter’s death.</p>
    <p>This slow burn of a novel flits be­tween graphic scenes of abuse seven years apart, with Sowon dis­cov­er­ing the truth only on the eve of his fa­ther’s ex­e­cu­tion.</p>
    <p>Jeong has made Hyonsu some­one with whom you can em­pathise, for all his faults. He feels real, as some­one who has an in­fe­ri­or­ity com­plex due to his past fail­ures but who also shows ten­der­ness to­wards his son.</p>
    <p>“They say a cat can sense thunder right be­fore it rum­bles,” Jeong writes. “Per­haps the hu­man brain has a sim­i­lar sen­sory abil­ity – the clock of anx­i­ety that be­gins tick­ing when catastroph­e looms.”</p>
    <p>There is a brief turn into the su­per­nat­u­ral, which might be ac­cept­able in Korean folk­lore but sticks out in the English ver­sion.</p>
    <p>Yet this trip down the rab­bit hole sparks deep con­tem­pla­tion of the ghosts of trauma and the twists and turns of fate.</p>
    <p>If you like this, read:</p>
    <p>The Good Son by Jeong You-jeong, trans­lated by Kim Chi-young (Aba­cus, 2019, $17.95, avail­able at bit.ly/TheGoodSon_Jeong). Jeong takes read­ers on a jour­ney into the un­hinged psy­cho­pathic mind, as a young man wakes up cov­ered in blood and finds his mother with her throat slit.</p>
