    <p>• Orange-vested driv­ers of mo­tor­bike taxis have be­come al­lies of Thai­land’s prodemoc­racy pro­test­ers gath­er­ing across traf­fic-snarled Bangkok, of­fer­ing lifts and keep­ing an eye out for trou­ble.</p>
    <p>When the au­thor­i­ties shut down train lines this month in an ef­fort to curb daily ral­lies, driv­ers of the cap­i­tal’s mo­tor­taxis came to the res­cue, fer­ry­ing stranded pro­test­ers to demon­stra­tion sites.</p>
    <p>But they have long waited on the side­lines of the youth-led move­ment, cheer­ing stu­dent lead­ers on as they de­manded the res­ig­na­tion of Premier Prayut Chan-o-cha and is­sued un­prece­dented calls for re­form to the king­dom’s monar­chy.</p>
    <p>“I root for these kids,” said driver Su­patr Mana­porn­siri, 41, adding that he keeps his prices low be­cause he sup­ports their goals. “My in­come has in­creased a bit,” he said, say­ing it jumps from 1,000 baht (S$43.70) a day to 1,300-1,400 baht dur­ing protests.</p>
    <p>Another driver Pakin Kamhamauk, 44, some­times grants free rides, say­ing: “If they hap­pen to have no money, then that’s fine.”</p>
    <p>Mo­tor­taxis may ap­pear a hap­haz­ard trans­port op­tion for Bangkok’s traf­fic-clogged roads, but there is order in the chaos, with pas­sen­gers lin­ing up on spe­cific street cor­ners to wait for driv­ers.</p>
    <p>Con­gre­gat­ing around demon­stra­tions in their sig­na­ture orange vests, the driv­ers are also help­ful as look­outs. Ear­lier this month, when the au­thor­i­ties de­ployed wa­ter can­non for the first time since protests kicked off in July, it was the driv­ers who rushed to pro­vide early warn­ings and later block­aded some roads so ac­tivists could es­cape the riot po­lice.</p>
    <p>Mr Su­patr said he wor­ries for the mostly young pro­test­ers, who have ral­lied peace­fully for their goals. “They’re well dis­ci­plined. They don’t go off to do stupid things,” he said. “I want ev­ery sin­gle one of them to be safe.”</p>
    <p>Thai­land has a history of street pol­i­tics turn­ing vi­o­lent, with mas­sive demon­stra­tions in the past prompt­ing tough crack­downs from the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mo­tor­taxi driv­ers have aligned them­selves in pre­vi­ous protest cy­cles with the so-called “Red</p>
    <p>Shirts”, mostly work­ing-class blocs sup­port­ing ousted pop­ulist pre­miers Yingluck and Thaksin of the prom­i­nent Shi­nawa­tra clan.</p>
    <p>While today’s grow­ing move­ment is fronted by univer­sity stu­dents, the driv­ers – who of­ten hail from ru­ral north-eastern prov­inces and Bangkok’s slums – have gamely jumped on.</p>
    <p>Dubbed by some as the “Orange Shirts”, a play on Thai­land’s colour-coded po­lit­i­cal fac­tions, mo­tor­taxi driv­ers can snake through tens of thou­sands of pro­test­ers, lean­ing on their in­ti­mate knowl­edge of the cap­i­tal’s back­streets. “If there are pro­test­ers who faint, we’re usu­ally the first to help them out,” driver Yom, 49, who de­clined to give his full name, said.</p>
    <p>Happy to sup­port a move­ment seek­ing to oust Mr Prayut, he said the for­mer mil­i­tary chief has done lit­tle to boost Thai­land’s ail­ing econ­omy since the 2014 coup that brought him to power.</p>
    <p>“He doesn’t know how to man­age a sin­gle thing,” Mr Yom said. “The coun­try keeps edg­ing closer to a cliff. I think it’s time to re­place him with some­one new.”</p>
