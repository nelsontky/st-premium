    <p>Boris John­son isn’t the same as Don­ald Trump, Brexit isn’t “Make Amer­ica Great Again”, Bri­tain’s racial prob­lems aren’t of the same or­der as those of the United States, and the de­sire to fight a “cul­ture war” is re­stricted to a mi­nor­ity of ide­o­log­i­cally com­mit­ted vot­ers on the right and left in the Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Inevitably, par­al­lels be­tween the two coun­tries’ po­lit­i­cal cul­tures present them­selves. But dif­fer­ences mat­ter as much as the sim­i­lar­i­ties.</p>
    <p>A re­cent opin­ion poll by the More in Com­mon think-tank shows 55 per cent of Bri­tish vot­ers be­lieve their views are cen­trist, while only 33 per cent of Amer­i­cans iden­tify as po­lit­i­cally “mod­er­ate”.</p>
    <p>In Bri­tain, 85 per cent of vot­ers think “cli­mate change is an is­sue that con­cerns us all”. In the US, no such con­sen­sus has been reached. If the Black Lives Mat­ter de­bate feels less in­tense in Bri­tain, it’s not be­cause the ar­gu­ments carry less weight, it’s be­cause Bri­tons of African-Caribbean her­itage com­prise 3 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion, while the equiv­a­lent US fig­ure is 14 per cent.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain is also less ide­o­log­i­cally di­vided than many other Euro­pean coun­tries, even in the Brexit era. And yet, the Bri­tish me­dia and some po­lit­i­cal de­bates in­creas­ingly echo the cul­ture wars of the US.</p>
    <p>First, the Brexit ref­er­en­dum put a rocket un­der iden­tity pol­i­tics. More vot­ers now con­sider them­selves Leave or Re­main sup­port­ers than iden­tify with tra­di­tional po­lit­i­cal par­ties on eco­nom­ics, whether Labour or Con­ser­va­tive. Sec­ond, so­cial me­dia am­pli­fies the views of the 12 per cent of vot­ers who use these chan­nels most fre­quently to com­mu­ni­cate their un­com­pro­mis­ing “pro­gres­sive ac­tivist” and “back­bone con­ser­va­tive” views.</p>
    <p>Third, what­ever hap­pens in Amer­ica is soon copied over in Bri­tain; the bad as well as the good.</p>
    <p>Cul­ture wars, un­for­tu­nately, are primed for ex­port across the At­lantic. In re­cent weeks, what lit­tle space in the Bri­tish press that hasn’t been de­voted to Brexit and Covid-19 vac­cines has been taken up with cul­ture and iden­tity controvers­ies.</p>
    <p>Should English soc­cer play­ers keep tak­ing the knee like their Amer­i­can foot­ball coun­ter­parts to show re­spect for Black Lives? Was Eton Col­lege, the world’s most fa­mous pri­vate school, right to sack a teacher for his re­ac­tionary views of the dif­fer­ences be­tween men and women that he posted on YouTube? Should Cam­bridge Univer­sity in­sist speak­ers “re­spect” the views of ev­ery­body else?</p>
    <p>Some of these is­sues are fairly eas­ily ad­dressed, de­spite the me­dia storms.</p>
    <p>Foot­ball fans shouldn’t boo play­ers who take the knee, nor should play­ers be forced by their clubs or col­leagues to make the</p>
    <p>ges­ture. Even prom­i­nent right-wing old Eto­ni­ans think the teacher with chau­vin­ist views was in breach of his em­ploy­ment con­tract when he re­fused to take down his video.</p>
    <p>But the broader de­bate around free­dom of speech, as ex­em­pli­fied by the Cam­bridge ker­fuf­fle, is of far greater con­se­quence – and less eas­ily dealt with.</p>
    <p>US uni­ver­si­ties have been roiled by fierce de­bates about iden­tity pol­i­tics. While Bri­tain is nowhere near as bad, nei­ther is it im­mune.</p>
    <p>“No plat­form for fas­cists” was the slo­gan of stu­dent rad­i­cals in the Thatcherit­e 1980s, in­tent on ex­clud­ing right-wing speak­ers from cam­pus and col­lege. Vi­o­lence on cam­pus wasn’t un­known then. These schisms were real.</p>
    <p>In most Bri­tish uni­ver­si­ties to­day, ar­gu­ments about “snowflakes” and “wok­ery” con­cern only a mi­nor­ity of stu­dents and are con­ducted peace­ably. To­day, it’s the well-mean­ing but ner­vous univer­sity au­thor­i­ties who are likely to over-re­act and close down de­bate.</p>
    <p>The chal­lenge to free speech has spread far enough that Cam­bridge fac­ulty mem­bers felt im­pelled to vote on the mat­ter, over­whelm­ingly back­ing free ex­pres­sion in a vote last week. The roots lie in a transat­lantic row (of course).</p>
    <p>Eight months ago, Dr Jor­dan Peterson, a con­tro­ver­sial</p>
    <p>Cana­dian psy­chol­ogy pro­fes­sor, was of­fered a vis­it­ing fel­low­ship by Cam­bridge. Dr Peterson’s views about the im­por­tance of male self-es­teem and his dis­dain for po­lit­i­cal cor­rect­ness have made him many en­e­mies. Stu­dents protested against this ap­point­ment and the univer­sity au­thor­i­ties with­drew the of­fer.</p>
    <p>Many fac­ulty mem­bers with un­fash­ion­able views be­came alarmed that it might be their turn next. The aca­demic au­thor­i­ties re­pented their de­ci­sion and drew up a pol­icy to up­hold free­dom of speech.</p>
    <p>The new code of con­duct would si­mul­ta­ne­ously up­hold “ro­bust and chal­leng­ing” de­bate, “free speech within the law” and a de­mand that speak­ers should be “free to ex­press them­selves with­out fear of dis­re­spect or dis­crim­i­na­tion”, and be “re­spect­ful of the di­verse iden­ti­ties of oth­ers.”</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, this new code merely height­ened the alarm with its sug­ges­tions that speak­ers must “re­spect” the views of oth­ers, no mat­ter what those might be.</p>
    <p>The univer­sity had in­ad­ver­tently de­vised a char­ter for cen­sor­ship. At Ox­ford Univer­sity, Cam­bridge’s an­cient ri­val, it is ac­knowl­edged that not all the­o­ries de­serve equal re­spect.</p>
    <p>More than 100 aca­demics mounted a re­bel­lion against the word­ing of the code, spear­headed by philoso­pher Arif Ahmed. He put for­ward an amend­ment that the word “re­spect” should be re­placed with “tol­er­ance”.</p>
    <p>Why, for in­stance, should the­ists and athe­ists re­spect each other’s views? Scep­tics like Voltaire and David Hume, and be­liev­ers like</p>
    <p>C.S. Lewis and G.K. Ch­ester­ton would fall foul of that edict.</p>
    <p>In a vote of aca­demics last week, the rebel amend­ments were passed by an over­whelm­ing ma­jor­ity. Mr Roger Mo­sey, mas­ter of Sel­wyn Col­lege, told me the vote re­flects the mod­er­a­tion of fac­ulty and the stu­dent body alike: “Stu­dents are mostly sen­si­ble and much less politi­cised than in my (80s) gen­er­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>He said the 87 per cent ma­jor­ity was a con­vinc­ing en­dorse­ment of aca­demic free­dom.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s univer­sity sys­tem is rated the best in the world af­ter that of the US in most rank­ings.</p>
    <p>The Ivy League is more richly en­dowed, but a rep­u­ta­tion for tol­er­ance will in­crease the at­trac­tion of Bri­tish col­leges in the com­pe­ti­tion for tal­ent.</p>
    <p>Whether we like ar­gu­ments that op­pose us, or their bear­ers, the spirit of John Henry Newman, au­thor of the clas­sic 19th-cen­tury work on academia, The Idea Of A Univer­sity, de­serves to be up­held. “Quarry the gran­ite rock with ra­zors, or moor the ves­sel with a thread of silk; then may you hope with such keen and del­i­cate in­stru­ments as hu­man knowl­edge and hu­man rea­son to con­tend against those gi­ants, the pas­sion and the pride of man.”</p>
    <p>Pas­sion and pride have their place. But de­bar­ring voices from the con­ver­sa­tion on be­half of oth­ers is al­ways an er­ror, whether the row oc­curs in Cam­bridge, Mas­sachusetts, or Cam­bridge, East Anglia.</p>
