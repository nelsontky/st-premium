    <p>All for­eign work­ers who have re­sumed full-time work must be paid their pre­vail­ing salaries, the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) said in re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it would be un­re­al­is­tic to im­pose a uni­form re­quire­ment across all em­ploy­ers, es­pe­cially for work­ers who can­not re­sume work, it added.</p>
    <p>The MOM’s po­si­tion is that em­ploy­ers should en­gage and mu­tu­ally agree with their unions and for­eign em­ploy­ees on ap­pro­pri­ate salary ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>“Im­pos­ing a uni­form re­quire­ment oth­er­wise would re­sult in em­ploy­ers that could give bet­ter sup­port pay­ing j ust the min­i­mum, while em­ploy­ers who can­not af­ford would have to con­trac­tu­ally ter­mi­nate the em­ploy­ment re­la­tion­ship,” said an MOM spokesman.</p>
    <p>“We should also bear in mind that there are many em­ploy­ers who have been se­verely af­fected by the eco­nomic slow­down and would have to im­ple­ment cost-sav­ing mea­sures, in­clud­ing mak­ing ad­just­ments to em­ploy­ees’ salaries.”</p>
    <p>The min­istry ac­knowl­edged that Covid-19 has brought about un­prece­dented chal­lenges for both work­ers and em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>Whether work can re­sume is de­pen­dent on sev­eral fac­tors, in­clud­ing whether sus­pended projects have restarted and if re­quire­ments for safe dis­tanc­ing are in place.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, em­ploy­ers in the con­struc­tion in­dus­try are re­quired to make monthly dec­la­ra­tions on salary pay­ments to their for­eign work­ers.</p>
    <p>Based on the dec­la­ra­tions to MOM, most em­ploy­ers have ei­ther paid salaries or were able to pay out­stand­ing salaries af­ter the min­istry’s in­ter­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>Due to fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties, some em­ploy­ers were un­able to pay owed salaries, MOM said.</p>
    <p>It added that the Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Dis­pute Man­age­ment (TADM) has been work­ing di­rectly with fi­nan­cially strained em­ploy­ers and rel­e­vant stake­hold­ers to en­sure that salaries are paid to work­ers.</p>
    <p>TADM is jointly run by MOM, the Na­tional Trades Union Congress and the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion. To date, it has en­gaged about 750 em­ploy­ers in to­tal on salary mat­ters.</p>
    <p>“As a re­sult of these proac­tive ef­forts, the num­ber of em­ploy­ers whose for­eign work­ers di­rectly filed salary claims at the TADM be­tween April and July 2020 was about 30 per cent less than the same pe­riod last year – about 700 em­ploy­ers this year, com­pared with 950 em­ploy­ers last year,” the MOM spokesman said.</p>
    <p>On April 11, MOM is­sued an advi</p>
    <p>sory to re­mind em­ploy­ers in the con­struc­tion sec­tor that they must con­tinue to pay for­eign work­ers in dor­mi­to­ries their salaries elec­tron­i­cally within seven days af­ter the end of the salary pe­riod.</p>
    <p>For­eign work­ers who do not re­ceive their salaries may con­tact TADM di­rectly or re­port to the For­ward As­sur­ance and Sup­port Team of­fi­cers on the ground.</p>
    <p>Said the spokesman: “MOM will also take en­force­ment ac­tion against er­rant em­ploy­ers who fail to pay salaries to their work­ers, which would in­clude forc­ing work­ers to re­turn salaries that have been paid.”</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers who flout salary mat</p>
    <p>Im­pos­ing a uni­form re­quire­ment oth­er­wise would re­sult in em­ploy­ers that could give bet­ter sup­port pay­ing just the min­i­mum, while em­ploy­ers who can­not af­ford would have to con­trac­tu­ally ter­mi­nate the em­ploy­ment re­la­tion­ship. We should also bear in mind that there are many em­ploy­ers who have been se­verely af­fected by the eco­nomic slow­down and would have to im­ple­ment cost-sav­ing mea­sures, in­clud­ing mak­ing ad­just­ments to em­ploy­ees’ salaries.</p>
    <p>ters may be pe­nalised with hefty fines or im­pris­on­ment.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Em­ploy­ment Act, re­peat of­fend­ers who fail to make timely pay­ment of salaries to their em­ploy­ees can be fined be­tween $6,000 and $30,000 or jailed for up to a year, or both.</p>
    <p>“Re­gard­less of the ex­tent of salary sup­port pro­vided, em­ploy­ers should en­sure that they con­tinue to take care of the well-be­ing of all their work­ers,” the MOM spokesman said. “For work per­mit hold­ers, em­ploy­ers are legally obliged to pro­vide for their up­keep and main­te­nance.</p>
