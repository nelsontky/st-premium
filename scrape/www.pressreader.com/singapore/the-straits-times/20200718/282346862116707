    <p>Fab­ri­cated doc­u­ments, sus­pi­cious trans­ac­tions and US$192 mil­lion (S$267 mil­lion) in the hole.</p>
    <p>That is the predica­ment two banks claim they have found them­selves in af­ter fund­ing crude oil deals in the midst of Sin­ga­pore’s com­modi­ties trad­ing melt­down.</p>
    <p>The trou­bled trans­ac­tions, out­lined in court doc­u­ments, of­fer the clear­est look yet at some of the deals at the heart of a web of scan­dals in the Asian en­ergy-trad­ing hub that have al­ready caused more than US$9 bil­lion in po­ten­tial losses for global len­ders.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore units of CIMB Bank and Natixis claim to be vic­tims in sep­a­rate cases filed in the High Court of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The al­le­ga­tions span four sep­a­rate oil deals, but in­volve the same play­ers.</p>
    <p>They are Hon­top En­ergy (Sin­ga­pore), the oil trad­ing unit of con­glom­er­ate China Wanda Group that is now in re­ceiver­ship; Sin­ga­pore’s Sugih En­ergy In­ter­na­tional, which has re­named it­self as Ae­tur­num En­ergy In­ter­na­tional; and oil ma­jor BP.</p>
    <p>CIMB is su­ing to put Hon­top un­der j udi­cial man­age­ment and is seek­ing US$105 mil­lion from it and its par­ent, say­ing there is ev­i­dence of se­ri­ous fraud and mis­con­duct by its man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Natixis is su­ing Sugih En­ergy in two sep­a­rate cases seek­ing a com­bined US$86 mil­lion and/or the sur­ren­der of rel­e­vant doc­u­ments, ac­cus­ing it of false and fraud­u­lently made rep­re­sen­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>BP is not be­ing ac­cused of wrong­do­ing by ei­ther bank, based on an af­fi­davit CIMB filed in a case against Hon­top in the Sin­ga­pore court on July 1, and claims filed by Natixis against Sugih on June 19 and 29.</p>
    <p>The trades in ques­tion oc­curred late last year.</p>
    <p>Hon­top had ap­proached CIMB in early Novem­ber last year to fi­nance a pur­chase of Rus­sian ESPO crude from Sugih for re­sale to BP.</p>
    <p>It again ap­proached CIMB in De­cem­ber to fi­nance an­other pur­chase of Rus­sian oil from Sugih, this time for re­sale to Mit­sui & Co’s trad­ing unit in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>CIMB ini­tially de­clined to fi­nance the deal be­cause Mit­sui was not on its ap­proved buyer list, but within eight hours Hon­top came back and said BP would buy the cargo in­stead.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, Hon­top ap­proached Natixis in late Novem­ber to fi­nance a pur­chase of Brazil­ian Lula crude from Sugih for re­sale to BP.</p>
    <p>The banks said they is­sued let­ters of credit and paid Sugih for oil on be­half of Hon­top, based on Hon­top show­ing them sup­pos­edly bind­ing con­tracts to on-sell the oil to BP, ac­cord­ing to the fil­ings.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, Hon­top pro­vided Natixis with pur­chase and sale con­tracts with Sugih and BP and bills of lad­ing on the tanker New Honor for about 982,000 bar­rels of Lula crude. How­ever, when the banks went to col­lect from BP, the oil ma­jor said it had never agreed to some of the pur­chases.</p>
    <p>CIMB and Natixis said they paid Sugih a to­tal of about US$192 mil­lion on be­half of Hon­top for oil that Hon­top promised it would sell on to BP, ac­cord­ing to the fil­ings.</p>
    <p>When the banks went to BP’s Sin­ga­pore unit to be paid back, the oil ma­jor told them that the trans­ac­tion for one of the ship­ments was con­tin­gent on an­other pay­ment that never ma­te­ri­alised, and two never ex­isted at all, adding that the len­ders had been vic­tims of their client’s fraud­u­lent con­duct, ac­cord­ing to the fil­ings.</p>
    <p>As for the oil at the cen­tre of the deals, the banks say it is un­clear if the car­goes were there to be­gin with and whether they were dis­charged as planned, ac­cord­ing to the fil­ings.</p>
    <p>An at­tor­ney for Sugih, now Ae­tur­num, said the firm is an in­no­cent party in the se­ries of sales.</p>
    <p>It sold the car­goes to Hon­top, and Hon­top never dis­puted that they were de­liv­ered, he said.</p>
    <p>Hon­top is the one who failed to pay the banks for the car­goes, and that is who the banks should be look­ing to for pay­ment, the at­tor­ney said.</p>
    <p>BP de­clined to com­ment, as did at­tor­neys for Hon­top, CIMB and Natixis.</p>
    <p>The ac­cu­sa­tions shine a spot­light on the spe­cial re­la­tion­ship be­tween banks and com­mod­ity traders, who re­quire am­ple low-cost fi­nanc­ing for the high-cap­i­tal low-mar­gin busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The mag­ni­tude of the losses in Sin­ga­pore is now prompt­ing len­ders to take a long and hard look at whether the re­wards of fi­nanc­ing the sec­tor are suf­fi­cient to off­set the risks amid the most dra­matic oil-price crash in a gen­er­a­tion.</p>
