    <p>The United States yes­ter­day im­posed sanc­tions on Hong Kong leader Car­rie Lam and 10 other se­nior fig­ures, in a ma­jor new step against China’s clam­p­down in the semi-au­ton­o­mous city.</p>
    <p>In the most sig­nif­i­cant US ac­tion since China im­posed a tough na­tional se­cu­rity law on Hong Kong, Mrs Lam and the other se­nior fig­ures in the Asian fi­nan­cial hub will have any as­sets in the United States blocked.</p>
    <p>The move also crim­i­nalises any US fi­nan­cial trans­ac­tions with them.</p>
    <p>“The United States stands with the peo­ple of Hong Kong, and we will use our tools and au­thor­i­ties to target those un­der­min­ing their au­ton­omy,” US Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Steven Mnuchin said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Sanc­tion­ing the of­fi­cials marks yet an­other blow by US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump against Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>On Thursday, he signed a pair of ex­ec­u­tive or­ders bar­ring US res­i­dents and com­pa­nies from do­ing busi­ness with the par­ent com­pa­nies of the Chi­nese-owned TikTok and WeChat apps.</p>
    <p>China has “firmly op­posed” US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s or­ders to ban pop­u­lar Chi­nese so­cial me­dia apps TikTok and WeChat, call­ing it an act of po­lit­i­cal ma­nip­u­la­tion that over­rides mar­ket prin­ci­ples.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump had on Thursday is­sued a pair of ex­ec­u­tive or­ders to ban TikTok and WeChat in 45 days, a move that marks a sig­nif­i­cant es­ca­la­tion in the con­fronta­tion be­tween Bei­jing and Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>The ex­ec­u­tive or­ders will ban any “trans­ac­tions” be­tween Amer­i­cans or Amer­i­can firms and ByteDance, the par­ent com­pany of TikTok, as well as any trans­ac­tions re­lat­ing to WeChat with its par­ent firm Ten­cent. The ban will take ef­fect on Sept 20.</p>
    <p>China’s for­eign min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin said in re­sponse that Wash­ing­ton was us­ing na­tional se­cu­rity as a pre­text to use na­tional power to un­rea­son­ably sup­press Chi­nese en­ter­prises, call­ing it a “naked hege­monic act”.</p>
    <p>While he said Bei­jing “firmly op­posed” the lat­est moves, he stopped short of spell­ing out what coun­ter­mea­sures China would take.</p>
    <p>“The US side does not hes­i­tate to harm the rights and in­ter­ests of the ma­jor­ity of Amer­i­can users and com­pa­nies. It will over­ride mar­ket prin­ci­ples and in­ter­na­tional rules, and wil­fully carry out po­lit­i­cal ma­nip­u­la­tions and po­lit­i­cal sup­pres­sion,” he said at a brief­ing yes­ter­day. “The only re­sult will be a de­cline in its own moral stand­ing, na­tional i mage and in­ter­na­tional trust in the US.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s or­ders do not spell out what sort of trans­ac­tions would be banned, stat­ing that this would be de­fined by the US Sec­re­tary of Com­merce.</p>
    <p>The or­ders pointed out that both apps “au­to­mat­i­cally cap­tures vast swathes of in­for­ma­tion from its users”.</p>
    <p>In re­la­tion to WeChat, a widely used mes­sag­ing and pay­ments plat­form in China, it added that this data col­lec­tion al­lows the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party ac­cess to per­sonal and pro­pri­etary data from Amer­i­cans. It also al­lows China to keep tabs on Chi­nese cit­i­zens who visit the US, it said.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton’s lat­est move also turns up the pres­sure on ByteDance, which is in the mid­dle of ne­go­ti­at­ing a sale of short videoshar­ing app TikTok to Mi­crosoft. Mr Trump has threat­ened to ban the app, which re­port­edly has 100 mil­lion users in the US, un­less it is sold to an Amer­i­can firm.</p>
    <p>TikTok said in a state­ment that it was shocked by the ex­ec­u­tive or­der, which it said was is­sued without due process and that it would “pur­sue all reme­dies avail­able to us in or­der to en­sure... our com­pany and our users are treated fairly – if not by the ad­min­is­tra­tion, then by the US court”.</p>
    <p>Ten­cent said it was re­view­ing the ex­ec­u­tive or­der to get a “full un­der­stand­ing”.</p>
    <p>It is still un­clear how users of both apps would be af­fected by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s lat­est move. But trans­ac­tions that could be banned in­clude pur­chases of ads on the apps and agree­ments to make them avail­able on app stores, Bloomberg re­ported yes­ter­day, cit­ing an ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts have also said that a ban on WeChat, which is widely used for com­mu­ni­ca­tion by Chi­nese busi­nesses, could make it harder for US and Chi­nese firms to com­mu­ni­cate with one an­other.</p>
    <p>The or­ders by Mr Trump come a day af­ter Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo called on US com­pa­nies to re­move “un­trusted” Chi­ne­se­owned apps such as TikTok and WeChat from their app stores. It was a part of a series of mea­sures un­der a “Clean Net­work” pro­gramme that he un­veiled to pro­tect Amer­i­can data.</p>
    <p>Bi­lat­eral ties be­tween Bei­jing and Wash­ing­ton are at a his­toric low, with in­creas­ing con­fronta­tion in the past months over trade, tech­nol­ogy, es­pi­onage and the han­dling of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers say the lat­est moves mark a sig­nif­i­cant up­ping of the ante in the com­pe­ti­tion be­tween both sides.</p>
    <p>Mr Hu Xi­jin, ed­i­tor-in-chief of the na­tion­al­ist tabloid Global Times, wrote on his Weibo ac­count that Wash­ing­ton was out to de­stroy China’s most suc­cess­ful global tech com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>“The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has pub­licly ex­posed its ugly in­ten­tions of bar­ring non-US firms from break­ing through its tech­no­log­i­cal hege­mony,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Wang Huiyao, pres­i­dent of the Bei­jing-based think-tank Cen­tre for China and Glob­al­i­sa­tion, said Wash­ing­ton’s lat­est mea­sures went against the spirit of free en­ter­prise and com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>“We haven’t seen this kind of lan­guage for a long time. This will in­ten­sify ten­sions and ac­cel­er­ate the tech­ni­cal de­cou­pling be­tween China and the US,” he said.</p>
