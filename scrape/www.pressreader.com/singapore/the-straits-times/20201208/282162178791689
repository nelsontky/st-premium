    <p>A for­mer lec­turer at the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion (ITE) who took more than 300 up­skirt video clips us­ing a mod­i­fied mini cam­era was yes­ter­day jailed for 32 weeks.</p>
    <p>Chia Teck Huat, 41, had pleaded guilty on Oct 29 to three charges of in­sult­ing a woman’s mod­esty.</p>
    <p>One other sim­i­lar charge was taken into con­sid­er­a­tion dur­ing sen­tenc­ing by District Judge Adam Nakhoda.</p>
    <p>The court had ear­lier heard that Chia mod­i­fied mini cam­eras that he bought on­line so that they could be con­cealed in his lap­top bag.</p>
    <p>He would at­tach one of the cam­eras to a por­ta­ble charger and po­si­tion it to peek out from the bag.</p>
    <p>Be­tween July and Oc­to­ber 2017, he would walk around shop­ping malls, such as Plaza Sin­ga­pura, look­ing for mid­dle-aged of­fice women wear­ing short skirts.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing th­ese women, he would po­si­tion the cam­era un­der their dresses or skirts and record video clips.</p>
    <p>Chia would later re­view the clips and copy those that suc­cess­fully cap­tured the vic­tim’s un­der­wear to his per­sonal elec­tronic de­vices.</p>
    <p>A man who sus­pected Chia was tak­ing up­skirt images made a po­lice re­port on Oct 23 that year, and Chia was ar­rested the same day.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments state that 362 video clips were re­cov­ered from Chia’s tablet and thumb drive, which were seized in a raid at his home. Of th­ese, 314 were taken be­tween July and Oc­to­ber 2017, while 21 oth­ers were un­dated. The rest could not be played.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, District Judge Nakhoda noted that the for­mer lec­turer had sourced for the mini cam­eras on­line with the pur­pose of com­mit­ting the of­fences, and also ex­per­i­mented with the cam­era set-up in his lap­top bag for “op­ti­mal po­si­tion­ing”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the judge recog­nised that Chia had been di­ag­nosed with voyeuris­tic and ad­just­ment disor­ders, and had gone for 34 coun­selling ses­sions to ad­dress his of­fend­ing be­hav­iour since his ar­rest. He has also not re­of­fended.</p>
