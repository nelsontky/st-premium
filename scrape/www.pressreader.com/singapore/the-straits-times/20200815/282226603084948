    <p>A dull day’s trad­ing in a dull week has left lo­cal in­vestors look­ing for a guid­ing star on the fi­nan­cial hori­zon.</p>
    <p>Cau­tion over the virus-stricken econ­omy here and news of more lock­downs else­where have left traders in a wary mood.</p>
    <p>The sen­ti­ment had its ef­fect on the mar­ket with the Straits Times In­dex (STI) falling 14.65 points, or 0.56 per cent, to 2,581.32 with losers out­pac­ing gain­ers 263 to 184 on trade of 2.3 bil­lion shares worth $1.25 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>“A di­rec­tion­less ses­sion from Wall Street has set up much the same pic­ture in Asia to­day. Most ma­jor in­dices are drift­ing,” said Oanda senior mar­ket an­a­lyst Jef­frey Hal­ley.</p>
    <p>Mr Hal­ley also warned that although Asia con­tin­ues to be boosted by in­vestor sen­ti­ment re­gard­ing a re­cov­ery in global trade, many re­gional markets are now en­ter­ing “over-bought ter­ri­tory”.</p>
    <p>The best per­former among STI’s con­stituents was Sin­ga­pore Tech­nolo­gies En­gi­neer­ing (ST En­gi­neer­ing), which gained 3.67 per cent to close at $3.39. This was de­spite net profit falling by 4.4 per cent to $257.4 mil­lion for the first half.</p>
    <p>OCBC In­vest­ment Re­search said that the com­pany was “seek­ing to cap­ture op­por­tu­ni­ties” from the pan­demic, and was set to re­ceive more than $300 mil­lion in sup­port through­out the year.</p>
    <p>Avi­a­tion-re­lated coun­ters such as Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) and sup­port ser­vices provider Sats also rose. SIA gained 2.16 per cent to $3.79. Sats closed at $2.94, up 2.08 per cent.</p>
    <p>At the other end of the spec­trum, heavy­weights Jar­dine Mathe­son Hold­ings fell 2.78 per cent, while sta­ble­mate Jar­dine Strate­gic Hold­ings dipped 2.37 per cent.</p>
    <p>Other mem­bers of the Jar­dine</p>
    <p>Group were down as well: Hongkong Land fell by 3.17 per cent and Jar­dine Cy­cle & Car­riage re­treated 1.96 per cent. Hongkong Land is trad­ing on a cum-div­i­dend ba­sis.</p>
    <p>Banks also ended the week in the red. DBS Bank shed 1.63 per cent to $21.07, OCBC Bank fell 0.22 per cent to $8.95 and United Over­seas Bank lost 0.05 per cent to $20.07.</p>
    <p>Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore emerged the most heav­ily traded stock for the day, with 28.9 mil­lion shares chang­ing hands. The counter closed un­changed at 72 cents.</p>
    <p>Asian markets ended the week fairly mixed. The Nikkei 225 In­dex in­creased by 0.17 per cent while the Hang Seng added 0.21 per cent but Bursa Malaysia fell 0.75 per cent.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian mar­ket was the stand­out with health and tech shares send­ing the ASX up 0.6 per cent for the day and 2 per cent for the week – its big­gest weekly gain since the start of last month.</p>
