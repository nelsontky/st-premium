Changes to deductible­s Ward/treatment Current Recommende­d Day surgery
• Age above 80 $3,000 $2,000 Changes to pro-ration factors Ward/treatment Current Recommende­d Private hospital (including day surgery) 35% 25% Some examples of how the recommende­d changes can improve coverage for patients A 60-year-old Singaporea­n was hospitalis­ed in a community hospital due to a bone infection.
The patient stayed in a subsidised ward and spent 25 days in sub-acute care.
The patient was transferre­d to the community hospital for sub-acute care after completing treatment in an acute hospital when the intensity of care provided at acute hospitals was no longer required. Hence, the patient had already met the annual MediShield Life deductible from the acute hospital bill. The deductible needs to be met only once per policy year. A 37-year-old Singaporea­n was hospitalis­ed for two days in an acute hospital due to a bacterial infection, likely from eating raw/undercooke­d meat.
The patient stayed in a C-class ward, and about 80 per cent of the bill was for diagnostic tests and investigat­ions.
The patient had already met the annual MediShield Life deductible from a prior hospitalis­ation. The deductible needs to be met only once per policy year. Revised MediShield Life premiums* Age at next birthday Current premiums before subsidy ($) 145 250 390 525 800 1,020 1,100 1,195 1,320 1,530 1,590 1,675 1,935 2,025 2,055 130 195 310 435 630 755 815 885 975 1,130 1,175 1, 250 1,430 1,500 1,530 1 – 20 21 – 30 31 – 40 41 – 50 51 – 60 61 – 65 66 – 70 71 – 73 74 – 75 76 – 78 79 – 80 81 – 83 84 – 85 86 – 90 > 90 * These revised premiums do not include the subsidies that will be given to lowerto middle-income groups, which permanent residents also receive but at half the amount that Singapore citizens get. They also do not include the one-off Covid-19 subsidy for two years and any additional subsidies for Pioneer and Merdeka Generation seniors, which are only for Singaporea­ns. EXAMPLE 1 EXAMPLE 2 Name: Mr Tan Age: 60 Hospitalis­ed: 25 days Bone infection Name: Mr Soh Age: 37 Hospitalis­ed: 2 days Bacterial infection MediShield Life pays
Total that can be withdrawn from Medisave Total out of pocket (cash) NOTES:
1 As the patient is a Singapore citizen who stayed in a subsidised community hospital ward, the MediShield Life claim is computed based on 100 per cent of the bill.
2 Subsidised community hospital ward patients can receive means-tested government subsidies of up to 75 per cent of total bill.
3 Lower of the claim limit for daily ward and treatment charges in a community hospital, ($350 x 25 days) = $8,750, or 100 per cent of charges incurred of $10,700. Therefore, the claimable amount is $8,750.
4 Under the preliminar­ily recommende­d claim limit for sub-acute care in a community hospital, the claimable amount is the lower of the claim limit ($430 x 25 days) = $10,750, or 100 per cent of charges incurred of $10,700. Therefore, the claimable amount is $10,700.
5 The patient had already met the deductible in a prior hospitalis­ation bill.
6 Co-insurance = 10 per cent of claimable amount for the first $5,000, inclusive of deductible, followed by 5 per cent for the next $5,000 and 3 per cent for claimable amount above $10,000. The patient is already at the 3 per cent tier for co-insurance due to claims incurred in a prior hospitalis­ation bill. • • • • • • MediShield Life claim computatio­n MediShield Life claim computatio­n Hospital bill1 Hospital bill1 Bill breakdown Bill breakdown Total bill Total bill $17,300 $3,750 Total bill after government subsidy2 Total bill after government subsidy2 $10,700 $1,800 Current3 Recommende­d4 Current3 Recommende­d4 Daily ward and treatment charges (25 days of sub-acute care in community hospital) Daily ward and treatment charges (two days in normal ward) $8,750 $10,700 $1,400 $1,800 $10,700 $1,800 Total claimable amount Total claimable amount $8,750 $10,700 $1,400 $1,800 – – $0 (already met in prior hospitalis­ation) $0 (already met in prior hospitalis­ation) Less deductible­5 Less deductible­5 – – Less co-insurance6 Less co-insurance6 – ($262.50) ($321) – ($140) ($180) MediShield Life pays
