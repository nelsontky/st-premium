    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son may be cham­pi­oning his last-minute Brexit trade deal, but he faces a bat­tle with Scot­land in the com­ing months that could also de­cide the fu­ture di­rec­tion of the United King­dom.</p>
    <p>Within an hour of Mr John­son an­nounc­ing that an agree­ment with the Euro­pean Union had been reached last Thurs­day, Scot­tish First Min­is­ter Ni­cola Stur­geon quickly re­asserted her de­mand for a sec­ond vote on split­ting away from the three-cen­turies-old union with Eng­land and Wales.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore the spin starts, it’s worth re­mem­ber­ing that Brexit is hap­pen­ing against Scot­land’s will,” she wrote on Twit­ter. “There is no deal that will ever make up for what Brexit takes away from us.”</p>
    <p>Scot­land, which voted by 62 per cent to 38 per cent to re­main in the EU in 2016, is sched­uled to hold elec­tions to its de­volved leg­is­la­ture in Ed­in­burgh in May.</p>
    <p>Polls sug­gest Ms Stur­geon’s proin­de­pen­dence Scot­tish Na­tional Party (SNP) could win a ma­jor­ity that would re­in­force her pledge to hold a ref­er­en­dum on leav­ing Britain in the early part of the new Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>That would es­ca­late the stand­off be­tween Lon­don and Ed­in­burgh, with Mr John­son hav­ing re­fused to sanc­tion a sec­ond vote.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials in­side his Con­ser­va­tive Party have al­ready sounded the alarm bell over Scot­land and the need to counter the SNP.</p>
    <p>The trade deal with the EU opens up “huge op­por­tu­ni­ties” for Scot­tish busi­nesses, Sec­re­tary of State for Scot­land Alis­ter Jack said.</p>
    <p>But that is un­likely to pla­cate Scot­tish firms, which are al­ready strug­gling un­der the bur­den of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, ac­cord­ing to Ms Stur­geon.</p>
    <p>“Scot­land did not vote for any of this and our position is clearer than ever,” she said. “Scot­land now has the right to choose its own fu­ture as an in­de­pen­dent coun­try and once more re­gain the ben­e­fits of EU mem­ber­ship.”</p>
