    <p>Chil­dren’s hap­pi­ness is of­ten linked to the fi­nan­cial pre­pared­ness of their par­ents, and what is wor­ry­ing is that a sur­vey con­ducted by In­come found that about 75 per cent of par­ents here are con­cerned about not hav­ing enough money to pro­vide things that make their chil­dren happy.</p>
    <p>“This is an im­por­tant find­ing, be­cause we also found that 47 per cent of par­ents in Sin­ga­pore were will­ing to com­pro­mise their own life­style in or­der to fi­nan­cially pro­vide for things that make (their chil­dren) happy,” said In­come chief mar­ket­ing of­fi­cer Mar­cus Chew.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey also polled chil­dren, and found that 90 per cent of them were wor­ried that their life­style and hap­pi­ness could be dis­rupted if their par­ents were fi­nan­cially un­pre­pared for life’s un­ex­pected events.</p>
    <p>The chil­dren’s fears in­cluded not be­ing able to go on va­ca­tions, not re­ceiv­ing gifts and not buy­ing the lat­est gad­gets.</p>
    <p>PLAN­NING FOR KIDS</p>
    <p>The sur­vey re­vealed that in or­der for par­ents to help their chil­dren achieve fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity and hap­pi­ness, they will need to safe­guard them­selves fi­nan­cially.</p>
    <p>Mr Chew said that par­ents should pre­pare for life’s un­ex­pected events if they care for the well-be­ing of their chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“We all know that dur­ing un­fore­seen cir­cum­stances such as crit­i­cal ill­ness or death, a pay­out can never re­place... the loss of a loved one. But at least you can tide the fam­ily over, be­cause the last thing you want to worry about is money,” he said.</p>
    <p>HOW TO MAKE KIDS HAPPY</p>
    <p>The sur­vey re­vealed that the par­ents some­times do not re­ally know how their chil­dren feel.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, many par­ents think that their chil­dren will be happy when they are able to pur­sue hob­bies, their pas­sions, sports and gam­ing, and re­ceive presents.</p>
    <p>But their chil­dren see ex­pe­ri­ences such as va­ca­tions, hav­ing good re­la­tions with their peers and spend­ing qual­ity time with their fam­i­lies as more im­por­tant than ma­te­rial needs.</p>
    <p>Mr Chew ad­vises that par­ents should think about fi­nan­cial plan­ning in tan­dem with plan­ning their chil­dren’s ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“In the fu­ture, we will have a gen­er­a­tion of chil­dren who will grow up to be par­ents them­selves. And they will learn to man­age their fi­nances bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>It is never too late to start plan­ning for your­self and your fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“I have a friend who is 56, and he just started an­other round of re­tire­ment plan­ning. So it is never too late. But if you have a child who is 10 or 12 years old, I think it is def­i­nitely crit­i­cal. (Chil­dren of that age) have an­other 10 years be­fore they can start work­ing, so they will be re­ly­ing on you to pro­vide for them,” Mr Chew said.</p>
    <p>For more, tune in to Work­day After­noon with Cla­ressa Mon­teiro on week­days from 1pm to 4pm.</p>
    <p>We all know that dur­ing un­fore­seen cir­cum­stances such as crit­i­cal ill­ness or death, a pay­out can never re­place... the loss of a loved one. But at least you can tide the fam­ily over, be­cause the last thing you want to worry about is money.</p>
    <p>MR MAR­CUS CHEW, on the im­por­tance of pre­par­ing for un­ex­pected events.</p>
