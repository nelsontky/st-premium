    <p>A man used cam­eras dis­guised as pens to record videos of his fe­male friends and ten­ant in the nude.</p>
    <p>Af­ter he was caught, he told the po­lice that he com­mit­ted the of­fences “for fun”.</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old Sin­ga­porean was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to 11 weeks’ jail and a fine of $7,000. He can­not be named ow­ing to a gag or­der to pro­tect his vic­tims’ iden­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>The man had ear­lier ad­mit­ted to two counts of in­sult­ing a woman’s mod­esty and be­ing in pos­ses­sion of ob­scene films.</p>
    <p>The court heard that he bought two spy pens on­line for about $20 to $30 each.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Chew Xin Ying said: “His modus operandi was to en­ter the toi­let be­fore his vic­tims, and plant the de­vice in the toi­let, an­gling it to face the shower area.</p>
    <p>“He ac­ti­vated the cam­era by press­ing a but­ton, and left it in record­ing mode. He only tar­geted his fe­male friends who used the toi­lets and a fe­male ten­ant who was stay­ing at his home.”</p>
    <p>The man would later re­trieve the spy pens to view the videos, the court heard.</p>
    <p>In July 2017, he used one of the de­vices to record a video of one of his close friends, a 26-year-old woman, while she was tak­ing a shower at his home.</p>
    <p>Two months later, he went to an­other friend’s con­do­minium for a swim and com­mit­ted a sim­i­lar of­fence.</p>
    <p>The court heard that he went to a bath­room in the friend’s home on Sept 2, 2017, and placed a spy pen in a tooth­brush holder.</p>
    <p>One of his friends, a 28-year-old man who was also a guest, saw him com­ing out of the bath­room, clutch­ing a black sling bag. The friend’s 26-year-old girl­friend then took a shower there.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tor said: “Shortly af­ter, (the male friend) felt un­easy as he re­called that the ac­cused had come out of the... toi­let hold­ing a black sling bag, and de­cided to check... (He) ini­tially did not find any­thing sus­pi­cious.</p>
    <p>“As he was leav­ing, he saw a pen in the tooth­brush holder. He tried to use it but re­alised that it could not write. He then de­cided to dis­man­tle it, and dis­cov­ered that it was ac­tu­ally a spy pen with cam­era and con­tained an SD card.”</p>
    <p>The male friend took the de­vice and told his girl­friend about it the next day. They checked the SD card and found that it con­tained sev­eral in­crim­i­nat­ing videos.</p>
    <p>The male friend no­ti­fied the other vic­tims, and they con­fronted the of­fender on Sept 11, 2017. A po­lice re­port was made the next day.</p>
