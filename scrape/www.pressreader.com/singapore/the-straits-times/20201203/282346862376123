    <p>There is “noth­ing un­usual or im­proper” about the vot­ing pro­ce­dures adopted for the pro­posed merger of Sa­bana Shari’ah Com­pli­ant In­dus­trial Real Es­tate In­vest­ment Trust (Sa­bana Reit) and ESR-Reit.</p>
    <p>Sa­bana Reit’s man­ager said in a bourse fil­ing yes­ter­day, in re­sponse to con­cerns raised by the deal’s key op­po­nents, that the pro­ce­dures ap­ply equally to all unit hold­ers of the trust.</p>
    <p>The vot­ing pro­ce­dures are the same as those adopted in all Reit merg­ers in Sin­ga­pore to date, in that unit hold­ers – in­clud­ing nom­i­nee com­pa­nies and cus­to­di­ans – were al­lowed to ap­point only one proxy, and unit hold­ers could vote their units only in one di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>Sa­bana Reit is seek­ing ap­proval for an amend­ment to its trust deed to al­low ap­point­ment of only one proxy for the scheme meet­ing (ver­sus two prox­ies for any meet­ing of the Reit) by cus­to­di­ans. If ap­proved at to­mor­row’s ex­tra­or­di­nary gen­eral meet­ing, this will be ap­pli­ca­ble for the scheme meet­ing later that day, when unit hold­ers vote on the merger.</p>
    <p>Quarz Cap­i­tal Man­age­ment and Black Crane Cap­i­tal raised con­cerns that this vot­ing process may be stacked against their in­ter­ests. The two ac­tivist funds have for months op­posed the con­tro­ver­sial merger as a “panic sell” of Sa­bana Reit at a sub­stan­tial dis­count.</p>
    <p>In a Nov 30 let­ter to the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore, they flagged po­ten­tial “vot­ing ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties” as a re­sult of the “one-proxy rule” for cus­to­di­ans or nom­i­nee com­pa­nies (typ­i­cally banks or bro­kers) sub­mit­ting the vote of unit hold­ers who are their clients.</p>
    <p>The fund man­agers claimed the re­stric­tions, for cus­to­di­ans to sub­mit only one proxy form, would mean that cus­to­di­ans can­not fully rep­re­sent all unit hold­ers’ votes. They also said cer­tain cus­to­dian banks were de­ter­min­ing their proxy vote us­ing ei­ther an “off­set­ting” or a “sim­ple ma­jor­ity” rule.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, as­sum­ing i nvestors A and B held Sa­bana Reit units via a cus­to­dian bank, and A sub­mits three votes in favour while B sub­mits two votes against, a cus­to­dian us­ing the “sim­ple ma­jor­ity” rule would sub­mit three votes in favour but none against the merger.</p>
    <p>But un­der the “off­set­ting” rule, the cus­to­dian would sub­mit only one vote in favour.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the Sa­bana Reit man­ager noted that it is not privy to and has no con­trol over the in­ter­nal pro­cesses of the nom­i­nee com­pa­nies and cus­to­di­ans or how they take in­struc­tions from their clients.</p>
    <p>The unit reg­is­trar, Board­room Cor­po­rate & Ad­vi­sory Ser­vices, will re­ceive and count the proxy forms, af­ter which the scru­ti­neer, DrewCorp Ser­vices, will ver­ify the forms.</p>
