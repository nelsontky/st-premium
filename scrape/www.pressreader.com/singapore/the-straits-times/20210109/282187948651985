    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment has pro­vided about $100 bil­lion to help in­di­vid­u­als and com­pa­nies cope with the fi­nan­cial hard­ship caused by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Be­sides fi­nan­cial is­sues, many are af­fected emo­tion­ally and that is why more peo­ple are seek­ing help for men­tal health is­sues amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>I am not a psy­chol­o­gist but a trained nu­merol­o­gist.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, I have no­ticed more peo­ple consulting me to read their life path. Many are feel­ing hope­less and look­ing for di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>I am glad that I am able to con­vince them that what­ever prob­lems they are fac­ing now are tem­po­rary.</p>
    <p>I tell them to try and get what­ever sup­port they can from their fam­ily mem­bers and loved ones, and to lower their ex­pec­ta­tions in life for the time be­ing.</p>
    <p>I also make them prom­ise that they will do good things for oth­ers in what­ever small way they can, be­cause what they sow, they will reap.</p>
    <p>These small acts will make them feel that life is more pur­pose­ful and worth liv­ing.</p>
    <p>I hope there are many other pro­fes­sion­als out there who can help save lives by giv­ing good ad­vice and coun­selling to those in need.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment agen­cies alone can­not reach out to help all those with men­tal health is­sues.</p>
    <p>We who are for­tu­nate should try to help the less for­tu­nate in our so­ci­ety.</p>

        <p data-role="text">The writer says that amid the pan&#xAD;demic, gov&#xAD;ern&#xAD;ment agen&#xAD;cies alone can&#xAD;not reach out to all those with men&#xAD;tal health is&#xAD;sues, so the com&#xAD;mu&#xAD;nity should try to help out.</p>
