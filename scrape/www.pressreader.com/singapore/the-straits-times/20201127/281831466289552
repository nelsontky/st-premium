    <p>•</p>
    <p>South Korea re­ported 583 new coronaviru­s cases yes­ter­day, the high­est since March, as the coun­try grap­ples with a third wave of in­fec­tions that ap­pears to be wors­en­ing de­spite tough new so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment reim­posed tough so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules on the cap­i­tal Seoul and sur­round­ing re­gions this week, only a month af­ter they had been eased fol­low­ing the sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Now some ex­perts say the govern­ment moved too early to re­lax those rules, as the daily of­fi­cial case tally ex­ceeds 500 for the first time since March 6.</p>
    <p>“The eas­ing was done be­cause of economic con­cerns and grow­ing fa­tigue, but it was pre­ma­ture and sowed the seeds of peo­ple’s complacenc­y,” said Dr Kim Woo­joo, a pro­fes­sor of in­fec­tious dis­eases at Korea Univer­sity Guro Hospi­tal in Seoul.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s first wave emerged from meet­ings of a re­li­gious sect but most of the lat­est cases are oc­cur­ring i n of­fices, schools, gyms and small gath­er­ings in the wider gen­eral com­mu­nity around Seoul, mak­ing them harder to trace and con­tain.</p>
    <p>The armed forces or­dered a 10-day ban on leave af­ter a se­ries of out­breaks at mil­i­tary fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Other clus­ters have been traced to a sauna, a high school, an aer­o­bics academy, churches, a chil­dren’s cafe and a friends’ get­to­gether.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 has ar­rived right be­side you and your fam­ily,” Health Min­is­ter Park Ne­ung-hoo told a tele­vised meet­ing of health of­fi­cials. “In par­tic­u­lar, the spread of in­fec­tions among young gen­er­a­tions is ex­tra­or­di­nary.”</p>
    <p>In­fec­tions among young peo­ple, many of whom show no symp</p>
    <p>toms, prompted the govern­ment to urge stu­dents to stop at­tend­ing cram schools and pri­vate lessons ahead of col­lege en­trance ex­ams slated for next Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“In­fec­tions are emerg­ing con­cur­rently in our daily lives, in­clud­ing (at) fam­ily gath­er­ings and in­for­mal get-to­geth­ers, which make it dif­fi­cult for the govern­ment to take pre-emp­tive action,” Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Yoo Eun-hae told a brief­ing.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials did not re­spond di­rectly to crit­i­cism that the govern­ment had been too quick to ease re­stric­tions fol­low­ing the pre­vi­ous spike in in­fec­tions in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>They have ex­pressed re­gret about the economic im­pact of the lat­est mea­sures, com­ing just af­ter Asia’s fourth-largest econ­omy re­turned to growth in the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Of the lat­est cases, 553 were lo­cally trans­mit­ted and al­most 73 per cent of those were in the greater Seoul area, the Korea Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion said.</p>
    <p>To­tal in­fec­tions in South Korea stand at 32,318, with 515 deaths.</p>
    <p>EAS­ING CURBS TOO SOON</p>
    <p>The eas­ing was done be­cause of economic con­cerns and grow­ing fa­tigue, but it was pre­ma­ture and sowed the seeds of peo­ple’s complacenc­y.</p>
