    <p>NEW YORK • Seven months af­ter the United States and China signed a pre­lim­i­nary agree­ment to tem­per their trade war, Bei­jing’s pur­chases of Amer­i­can agri­cul­tural goods have yet to reach the deal’s tar­get.</p>
    <p>As Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump read­ies for a tough re-elec­tion bat­tle in Novem­ber, US me­dia has re­ported that the two sides are set to meet from Aug 15 to dis­cuss the deal, which calls for China to sharply i ncrease its buy­ing of Amer­i­can goods and ser­vices this year and next.</p>
    <p>But ac­cord­ing to data com­piled by the Peter­son In­sti­tute for In­ter­na­tional Eco­nom­ics (PIIE), Chi­nese agri­cul­tural pur­chases at the end of June were far from where they should be at this point in the year. They had reached only 39 per cent of their semi-an­nual tar­get, ac­cord­ing to US fig­ures, or about 48 per cent, based on Chi­nese fig­ures.</p>
    <p>“If we get back to what the level of trade was in 2017, we’ll be lucky,” said PIIE se­nior fel­low Chad Bown, who au­thored the study, re­fer­ring to the year the trade war be­gan.</p>
    <p>Un­der the deal’s terms, China agreed to buy an ad­di­tional US$32 bil­lion (S$44 bil­lion) worth of US agri­cul­ture prod­ucts over the next two years from 2017 lev­els.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese or­ders for corn and soya beans have risen since the mid­dle of last month, with Bei­jing buy­ing j ust over three mil­lion tonnes of Amer­i­can oilseeds be­tween July 14 and Aug 7, ac­cord­ing to data from the US Depart­ment of Agri­cul­ture.</p>
    <p>At the end of July, the US saw the largest-ever daily or­der by China for corn, of 1.9 mil­lion tonnes.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ments came as a re­lief to US farm­ers, who are ex­pect­ing a bumper crop this year and need buy­ers to take it.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese “re­alise that we are not be­ing the best of bud­dies right now, but they need the prod­ucts and they are gonna take as much as they need”, said Mr Jack Scov­ille, an agri­cul­tural mar­ket an­a­lyst for Price Fu­tures Group.</p>
    <p>But an­a­lysts warn that any or­ders could still be called off.</p>
    <p>Brazil and Ar­gentina, two of the world’s largest soya bean and corn pro­duc­ers, are start­ing their har­vests next spring, said Mr Brian Hoops, pres­i­dent of the bro­ker­age firm Mid­west Mar­ket Solutions.</p>
    <p>China “could can­cel all th­ese pur­chases they made in July and buy at much cheaper prices if that’s avail­able to them”, he said.</p>
    <p>The sharp global eco­nomic down­turn caused by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has, mean­while, badly hit in­ter­na­tional trade.</p>
