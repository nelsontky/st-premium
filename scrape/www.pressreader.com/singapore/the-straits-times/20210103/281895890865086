    <p>• Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping touted his govern­ment’s suc­cess in con­trol­ling the Covid-19 out­break, and its hard-won achieve­ments in eco­nomic recovery and poverty erad­i­ca­tion in 2020, in an ad­dress which an­a­lysts said em­pha­sised the im­por­tance of peo­ple and set key na­tional de­vel­op­ment and eco­nomic goals for this year.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi called for con­tin­ued ef­forts to score more “glo­ri­ous” achieve­ments in 2021. The year ahead brings sev­eral mile­stones for Mr Xi and the Com­mu­nist Party, which cel­e­brates its cen­ten­nial in July, and will kick off a 15-year en­deav­our to build China into a “mod­ern so­cial­ist coun­try”.</p>
    <p>China will for­mally an­nounce the coun­try’s suc­cess in build­ing a “mod­er­ately pros­per­ous so­ci­ety” in the first half of 2021, a goal in­tro­duced by paramount leader Deng Xiaop­ing in the 1970s.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi will also lay the ground for a twice-a-decade lead­er­ship reshuf­fle in 2022, that is likely to see him se­cure power for another five years.</p>
    <p>China has writ­ten an epic in fight­ing Covid-19 as the coun­try put peo­ple and life first and fought the epi­demic with unity and per­se­ver­ance, Mr Xi said in his New Year’s Eve ad­dress.</p>
    <p>“We over­came the im­pact of the pan­demic and made sig­nif­i­cant achieve­ments in both con­trol­ling the coro­n­avirus and push­ing eco­nomic de­vel­op­ments,” Mr Xi had said in the speech broad­cast to</p>
    <p>China’s 1.4 bil­lion res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi also said: “Re­form and open­ing up have cre­ated mir­a­cles. In the fu­ture, we will deepen re­form and ex­pand open­ing up with greater bold­ness.”</p>
    <p>Com­ment­ing on the speech, an­a­lysts such as in­ter­na­tional busi­ness law pro­fes­sor Christo­pher Bo­vis at the Univer­sity of Hull in Bri­tain noted that Mr Xi had reaf­firmed China’s com­mit­ment to in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion, mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism, and con­tin­u­ous re­form of do­mes­tic sys­tems.</p>
    <p>But the fo­cus on eco­nomic growth did not lose touch with poli­cies aimed at pro­mot­ing hu­man de­vel­op­ment, Pro­fes­sor Bo­vis said.</p>
    <p>Ox­ford Univer­sity’s pro­fes­sor of his­tory and politics of mod­ern China Rana Mit­ter said: “China can take a lead by mak­ing it clear that mu­tual trade, open mar­kets, and a gen­uine will­ing­ness to ex­change hu­man cap­i­tal and tal­ent across bor­ders will cre­ate a high-value global econ­omy for all.”</p>
    <p>And Pro­fes­sor Jon Tay­lor, chair of the po­lit­i­cal science and geog­ra­phy depart­ment at the Univer­sity of Texas at San An­to­nio, said Mr Xi’s speech set im­por­tant na­tional de­vel­op­ment and eco­nomic goals</p>
    <p>He also cited Mr Xi’s quote that recog­nised the hard work of the av­er­age Chi­nese cit­i­zen in 2020: “Great­ness is forged in the or­di­nary. Heroes come from the peo­ple. Ev­ery per­son is re­mark­able.”</p>
