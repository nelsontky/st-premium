    <p>A 24-year-old en­tre­pre­neur went on trial yesterday for mo­lest­ing and sex­u­ally as­sault­ing his younger sis­ter’s pri­mary school friend, who was stay­ing over at their fam­ily flat after a night of drink­ing to cel­e­brate Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>Nor­van Tan En Jie was 21 years old when he al­legedly com­mit­ted the of­fences against the wo­man, then 19, in the early hours of Dec 26, 2016.</p>
    <p>He is con­test­ing two charges of sex­ual as­sault by pen­e­tra­tion and two charges of out­rage of mod­esty, for acts against the wo­man who was in­tox­i­cated then.</p>
    <p>Tan was de­scribed by life­style site Vul­can Post as a “se­rial en­tre­pre­neur” who had run five dif­fer­ent busi­nesses by the age of 21. In 2018, he co-founded food busi­ness Beef Bro, which has three out­lets.</p>
    <p>The court heard that the wo­man was a pri­mary school class­mate of Tan’s sis­ter, and the two had met friends for drinks on Christ­mas Day evening in 2016. When the two women ar­rived at Tan’s flat at about 5.40am, he was in his room with two friends after a night of drink­ing.</p>
    <p>After help­ing the al­leged vic­tim to the toi­let, Tan’s sis­ter asked him to leave his room so she could speak to one of his friends. Ac­cord­ing to the prosecutor­s, Tan car­ried the wo­man out of the toi­let and placed her on the liv­ing room sofa but she went back to the toi­let to vomit.</p>
    <p>Deputy Public Pros­e­cu­tor Ng Yi­wen said Tan then car­ried the wo­man to his sis­ter’s room, put her on the bed, touched her breast and in­serted his fin­ger into her. The wo­man ran back to the toi­let to throw up again, and felt some­one pull down her shorts and un­der­wear. She recog­nised Tan’s voice and strug­gled, but he sodomised her and then left, said the DPP. Tan’s sis­ter went to the toi­let later and took the wo­man back to her room.</p>
    <p>The wo­man told her friends about the in­ci­dent after that and her sus­pi­cions that Tan had sex­u­ally as­saulted her. She texted Tan’s sis­ter, who said he ad­mit­ted hav­ing “fin­gered” the al­leged vic­tim. She made a po­lice re­port on Dec 27, 2016.</p>
    <p>He is con­test­ing two charges of sex­ual as­sault by pen­e­tra­tion and two charges of out­rage of mod­esty, for acts against the wo­man who was in­tox­i­cated then.</p>
