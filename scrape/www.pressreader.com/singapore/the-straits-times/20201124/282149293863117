    <p>Among oth­ers, he was charged in 2017 with or­gan­is­ing a pub­lic assem­bly with­out a per­mit on MRT trains... He al­legedly did so to com­mem­o­rate the 30th an­niver­sary of Op­er­a­tion Spec­trum – an in­ter­nal se­cu­rity op­er­a­tion that saw 22 ac­tivists ar­rested in 1987 in what the Gov­ern­ment called a Marx­ist plot aimed at over­throw­ing it.</p>
    <p>Civil rights ac­tivist Jolo­van Wham Kwok Han was charged in a dis­trict court yes­ter­day with two of­fences un­der the Pub­lic Or­der Act.</p>
    <p>The 40-year-old Sin­ga­porean, who is the for­mer ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of mi­grant worker ad­vo­cacy group Hu­man­i­tar­ian Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Mi­gra­tion Eco­nom­ics, had al­legedly taken part in an assem­bly at the steps to the main en­trance of the for­mer State Courts build­ing in Have­lock Square around 9am on Dec 13, 2018.</p>
    <p>He is said to have demon­strated sup­port for the ac­tion of Xu Yuanchen, bet­ter known as Terry Xu, 38, the edi­tor of so­ciopo­lit­i­cal web­site The On­line Cit­i­zen (TOC), and TOC con­trib­u­tor Daniel De Costa Au­gustin, 37, by hold­ing up a piece of pa­per with the words – “Drop the charges against Terry Xu and Daniel De Costa”.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments, Wham had a pho­to­graph taken of him­self demon­strat­ing around the same time the pair were to be charged in court that day.</p>
    <p>Xu and De Costa were both charged on Dec 13, 2018, with crim­i­nal defama­tion for al­legedly</p>
    <p>de­fam­ing mem­bers of the Sin­ga­pore Cabi­net in a let­ter pub­lished on the TOC web­site. Their cases are still pend­ing.</p>
    <p>In the other charge, Wham is ac­cused of tak­ing part in a pub­lic assem­bly with­out a per­mit in the vicin­ity of Toa Payoh Cen­tral Com­mu­nity Club and Toa Payoh Neigh­bour­hood Po­lice Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Around 1pm on March 28 this year, he is said to have held up a piece of card­board with a smi­ley face drawn on it.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments state it was to demon­strate his sup­port for Nguyen Nhat Minh, who is said to have a sim­i­lar snap­shot cap­tured at the same lo­ca­tion on March 22.</p>
    <p>In the photo, Minh al­legedly held up a piece of card­board with the words – “SG is bet­ter than oil@ Fri days 4 fut ur esg ”.</p>
    <p>There was no men­tion of Minh’s case in court doc­u­ments seen by The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>With the two cases, Wham is fac­ing seven charges in all.</p>
    <p>Among oth­ers, he was charged in 2017 with or­gan­is­ing a pub­lic assem­bly with­out a per­mit on MRT trains along the North-South Line on June 3 that year.</p>
    <p>He al­legedly did so to com­mem­o­rate the 30th an­niver­sary of Op­er­a­tion Spec­trum – an in­ter­nal se­cu­rity op­er­a­tion that saw 22 ac­tivists ar­rested in 1987 in what the Gov­ern­ment called a Marx­ist plot aimed at over­throw­ing it.</p>
    <p>Wham’s bail was set at $15,000 yes­ter­day and his pre-trial con­fer­ence will be held on Friday.</p>
    <p>For tak­ing part in a pub­lic assem­bly with­out a per­mit, an of­fender can be fined up to $5,000.</p>
