    <p>Scrolling through the e-com­merce app Taobao one week­end last month, mar­ket­ing ex­ec­u­tive Li Nana spent close to 500 yuan (S$102) in de­posits on dozens of items, know­ing she would have to pay the full amounts for them be­tween Nov 1 and Nov 3 to en­joy mas­sive dis­counts.</p>
    <p>But the 26-year-old, like tens of thou­sands of oth­ers, missed the dead­lines when they ar­rived, so she not only for­feited her de­posit but also lost out on the price drop.</p>
    <p>“The de­tails of the sales are slightly dif­fer­ent from pre­vi­ous years, so it’s very con­fus­ing,” she told The Straits Times in a text mes­sage. “So I sup­pose we all pay a price for our neg­li­gence.”</p>
    <p>The on­line shopping phe­nom­e­non of Sin­gles’ Day is ac­tu­ally to­mor­row, but e-com­merce gi­ants such as Alibaba, which owns Taobao, JD.com and Pin­duo­duo, have been run­ning pro­mo­tions ex­tra early, be­gin­ning on Oct 21, to al­low cus­tomers more time to shop.</p>
    <p>What be­gan as a fes­ti­val for stu­dents is now the world’s big­gest shopping event, with re­tail­ers all across Asia tak­ing part.</p>
    <p>It is es­pe­cially i mpor­tant i n China this year as an in­di­ca­tion of whether do­mes­tic con­sump­tion has truly re­cov­ered from the im­pact of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing last year’s Sin­gles’ Day shopping ex­trav­a­ganza, Chi­nese con­sumers spent 410 bil­lion yuan (S$84.5 bil­lion) in 24 hours.</p>
    <p>This year, within 10 min­utes of the fes­ti­val kick­ing off on Oct 21, early sales beat last year’s records, net­ting some 7 bil­lion yuan (S$1.4 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>It is es­ti­mated that China’s top live-stream­ers Li Ji­aqi and Viya Huang sold more than 1 bil­lion yuan worth of prod­ucts through their streams.</p>
    <p>More than 250,000 brands and five mil­lion mer­chants are tak­ing part in the giant shopping spree which, in a sign of how global it has be­come, will cul­mi­nate in a live event tonight fea­tur­ing Amer­i­can pop stars Tay­lor Swift and Katy Perry.</p>
    <p>By the end of the shopping fes­ti­val at mid­night to­mor­row, Alibaba ex­pects some 800 mil­lion users would have taken part in it.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese re­tail­ers are bank­ing on stronger do­mes­tic de­mand – the econ­omy grew 4.9 per cent last quar­ter as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic came largely un­der con­trol in the coun­try – al­low­ing for most in­dus­tries to re­open.</p>
    <p>“Many Chi­nese mer­chants have shifted their sales on­line amid the pan­demic and some new re­tail busi­ness mod­els have thrived af­ter digi­tis­ing their re­tail value chains, ex­pe­dit­ing on­line and off­line in­te­gra­tion,” rat­ings agency Fitch said in a com­men­tary.</p>
    <p>It added: “China’s con­sumer and re­tail mar­ket is likely to fin­ish the year with a strong (fourth quar­ter), un­der­pinned by a faster re­cov­ery in the off­line seg­ment and a boost to con­sumer spend­ing from the up­com­ing (Sin­gles’ Day) shopping fes­ti­val.”</p>
    <p>The early kick-off also meant lo­gis­tics com­pa­nies were not over­whelmed, with de­liv­er­ies spread out over a longer pe­riod.</p>
    <p>De­liv­ery­man Le Yux­uan, who works in cen­tral Bei­jing, said his de­liv­ery load has in­creased by about 100 parcels a day in the past week.</p>
    <p>“It’s more man­age­able for us this way, in­stead of sud­denly hav­ing 500 more pack­ages one day,” the 24-year-old said.</p>
    <p>For shoppers like Miss Li, who has read all the fine print, her mo­bile phone and shopping card will be ready at mid­night when the bulk of the sales be­gins.</p>
    <p>“I’m not go­ing to give away my money for noth­ing again,” she said.</p>
