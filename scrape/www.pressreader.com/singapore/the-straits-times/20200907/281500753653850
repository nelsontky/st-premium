    <p>Typhoon Haishen lashed Ja­pan’s south­ern is­land of Kyushu yes­ter­day, cut­ting power to tens of thou­sands of homes and prompt­ing the au­thor­i­ties to call for some 1.8 mil­lion peo­ple to evac­u­ate.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre of the storm was track­ing close to the coast of Kagoshima pre­fec­ture in Kyushu yes­ter­day evening, ac­cord­ing to the Ja­pan Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Agency.</p>
    <p>It was not clear if it would make land­fall in Kyushu or re­main just off the coast as it heads to­wards South Korea.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties urged evac­u­a­tion for peo­ple in ar­eas across seven pre­fec­tures in south­ern Ja­pan, pub­lic broad­caster NHK said, adding that the storm had cut power to about 180,000 homes.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic trans­port ser­vices were all stopped in the af­fected pre­fec­tures.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies in­clud­ing Toy­ota Mo­tor and Canon said they planned to shut­ter fac­to­ries.</p>
    <p>The typhoon was fore­cast to sus­tain winds of up to 216kmh by to­day, the me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal agency said, and was fore­cast to ap­proach the Goto Is­lands west of Na­gasaki in the early hours of this morn­ing.</p>
    <p>The storm, if it stays on its present track, will be the sec­ond typhoon to hit South Korea in less than a week.</p>
    <p>Typhoon Maysak swept across the Korean penin­sula last Thurs­day, leav­ing at least two dead and thou­sands tem­porar­ily with­out power.</p>
    <p>TOKYO • Typhoon Haishen bat­tered Ja­pan’s south­ern main­land yes­ter­day, cut­ting off power to tens of thou­sands of homes and prompt­ing the au­thor­i­ties to call for 1.8 mil­lion peo­ple to evac­u­ate.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre of the storm was track­ing close to the coast of Kagoshima pre­fec­ture in south­ern Kyushu is­land yes­ter­day evening, ac­cord­ing to the Ja­pan Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Agency. It was not clear if it would make land­fall in Kyushu or re­main just off the coast as it heads to­wards South Korea.</p>
    <p>The typhoon had cut off power to about 180,000 homes, pub­lic broad­caster NHK said, adding that pub­lic trans­port ser­vices were all stopped in the af­fected pre­fec­tures.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have urged evac­u­a­tions for peo­ple in ar­eas across seven pre­fec­tures i n south­ern Ja­pan, NHK said, an ef­fort that was com­pli­cated by so­cial dis­tanc­ing that meant evac­u­a­tion cen­tres could take fewer peo­ple than nor­mal. Com­pa­nies in­clud­ing Toy­ota Mo­tor and Canon planned to shut­ter fac­to­ries.</p>
    <p>“This typhoon is headed to­wards and may po­ten­tially make land­fall in Kyushu, bring­ing record rains, winds, waves and high tides,” Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe said at a meet­ing with Cabi­net min­is­ters. “I am ask­ing that peo­ple ex­er­cise the ut­most cau­tion.”</p>
    <p>A Twit­ter post showed trees on Yakushima, an is­land 100km south of Kagoshima city, shak­ing vi­o­lently in strong winds and driv­ing rain.</p>
    <p>El­derly cit­i­zens wear­ing face masks were gath­er­ing at evac­u­a­tion cen­tres i n Kagoshima and other parts of south­ern Ja­pan, footage on NHK showed.</p>
    <p>Two in­juries had been re­ported, ac­cord­ing to the Fire and Dis­as­ter Man­age­ment Agency, and the au­thor­i­ties were ad­vis­ing the high­est lev­els of cau­tion be­cause of the risk of dam­age from high winds, flood­ing and land­slides.</p>
    <p>The typhoon is fore­cast to have sus­tained winds of up to 216kmh by to­day, the me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal agency said. The storm was ex­pected to ap­proach the Goto Is­lands west of Na­gasaki around 3am to­day (2am Sin­ga­pore time) and then move to the Korean penin­sula, the agency said.</p>
    <p>One evac­u­a­tion cen­tre in Miyazaki has reached its ca­pac­ity and stopped ac­cept­ing evac­uees as a pre­cau­tion against the coron­avirus, ac­cord­ing to NHK.</p>
    <p>Air­lines have can­celled more than 500 flights de­part­ing from Ok­i­nawa and south­ern Ja­pan, NHK said. The bul­let train ser­vice in south­ern and west­ern Ja­pan was sus­pended, it added.</p>
    <p>Canon said it will sus­pend op­er­a­tions at four man­u­fac­tur­ing units, af­fect­ing seven fac­to­ries in Kyushu to­day, while Toy­ota de­cided to halt work at three plants in Fukuoka.</p>
    <p>Dai­hatsu Mo­tor’s fac­to­ries in Oita and Fukuoka pre­fec­tures will be sus­pended dur­ing the morn­ing shift to­day, a com­pany spokesman said. Sony planned to shut pro­duc­tion in Kagoshima, Ku­mamoto and Na­gasaki pre­fec­tures from yes­ter­day, a spokesman said.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s coast­guard last Sat­ur­day sus­pended its search for crew miss­ing from a cat­tle ship that cap­sized in the East China Sea be­cause of the typhoon.</p>
    <p>Typhoon Haishen fol­lows Typhoon Maysak, which smashed into the Korean penin­sula last Thurs­day, leav­ing at least two dead and thou­sands tem­porar­ily with­out power.</p>

Thou&#xAD;sands of house&#xAD;holds were left with&#xAD;out power in the pre&#xAD;fec&#xAD;ture, and some com&#xAD;pa&#xAD;nies planned to shut&#xAD;ter fac&#xAD;to&#xAD;ries.</p>
