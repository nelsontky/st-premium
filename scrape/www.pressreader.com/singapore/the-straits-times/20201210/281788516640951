    <p>In­done­sian po­lice have hard ev­i­dence con­firm­ing that the body­guards of Is­lamic De­fend­ers’ Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shi­hab il­le­gally pos­sessed firearms, which the po­lice said were used against of­fi­cers tail­ing their cars out­side Jakarta on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The ev­i­dence would be dis­closed af­ter an in­ves­ti­ga­tion of the in­ci­dent is com­pleted, the po­lice said.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent in the early hours of Mon­day led to a shoot-out, and six of the 10 body­guards of the vig­i­lante group leader were killed. The other four fled the scene and have re­mained fugi­tives. A po­lice car sus­tained a bump and its wind­shield has a bul­let hole.</p>
    <p>FPI said the six body­guards were vic­tims of “ex­tra-ju­di­cial killings”. It ac­cused the po­lice of breach­ing hu­man rights, and claimed the body­guards did not have firearms.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said the of­fi­cers acted in self-de­fence.</p>
    <p>Jakarta po­lice spokesman Yusri Yunus ap­pealed to peo­ple not to spread false­hoods.</p>
    <p>He was re­spond­ing to un­sub­stan­ti­ated claims that the po­lice had mis­led the pub­lic and that the two firearms shown at a po­lice press con­fer­ence did not be­long to the body­guards. “Af­ter we fin­ish gath­er­ing all the other ev­i­dence, we will dis­close (it) to the me­dia,” Colonel Yusri added, stress­ing that any­one spread­ing lies could be dealt with us­ing crim­i­nal charges.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that the po­lice con­fis­cated the mo­bile phones be­long­ing to the dead body­guards and col­lected sig­nif­i­cant data and ev­i­dence from them.</p>
    <p>When asked about this, a midranked po­lice of­fi­cer, who fol­lows the in­ves­ti­ga­tion, said the po­lice can­not yet dis­close any of the in­for­ma­tion or ev­i­dence col­lected as it would jeop­ar­dise on­go­ing in­ter­ro­ga­tions by the de­tec­tive unit.</p>
    <p>“You are a well-armed of­fi­cer and all of a sud­den, a pos­si­ble vic­tim, a col­league, has a gun pointed at them by an ill-in­ten­tioned per­son. What would you do?” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Rizieq has been un­der close sur­veil­lance af­ter he avoided po­lice sum­monses for in­ter­ro­ga­tion over a Nov 14 mass event, which flouted health mea­sures to con­trol the spread of the coro­n­avirus and sparked fears of fresh out­breaks in the cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>On Dec 1, he was due to ex­plain to the po­lice the mass event where thou­sands of his sup­port­ers gath­ered to at­tend the wed­ding of his daugh­ter and com­mem­o­rate</p>
    <p>Prophet Muham­mad’s birth­day.</p>
    <p>In­stead, he sent lawyers to the Jakarta po­lice sta­tion who cited health rea­sons for Mr Rizieq’s noshow. But no doc­tor’s af­fi­davit was given to the po­lice, a re­quire­ment for us­ing a health rea­son for not ful­fill­ing a sum­mons.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Mr Rizieq was again sup­posed to re­port to the po­lice af­ter a sec­ond sum­mons was is­sued. If he did not show up, the po­lice could then de­tain him.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment sent to for­eign me­dia on Tues­day, the po­lice said of­fi­cers had in­creased sur­veil­lance on FPI and Mr Rizieq’s move­ments af­ter in­for­ma­tion on so­cial me­dia re­vealed that he would mo­bilise thou­sands of his sup­port­ers to de­scend on the po­lice sta­tion where he was due for an in­ter­ro­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day morn­ing, about half an hour af­ter mid­night, on a toll road about 50km from Jakarta, sur­veil­lance of­fi­cers in a car were ob­structed by two of the four cars in Mr Rizieq’s con­voy.</p>
    <p>The body­guards were armed with ma­chetes and sick­les, and pointed a gun at them, the po­lice said. “Of­fi­cers who felt that their lives were at risk im­me­di­ately took mea­sured, de­ci­sive steps,” the state­ment said.</p>
