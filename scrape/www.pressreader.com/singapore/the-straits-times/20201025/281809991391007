    <p>When One FM 91.3 DJ Si­mon Lim re­ceived a let­ter and a present in his stu­dio, he was pleas­antly sur­prised – un­til he re­alised the fan who had sent him the gifts had been on the verge of be­com­ing the vic­tim of a love scam and was nearly duped into part­ing with al­most $5,000 in cash.</p>
    <p>The In­done­sian fan – Ms Inayah Muham­mad, 31 – had writ­ten to alert the Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings ra­dio DJ that a con­man had stolen his iden­tity and used his In­sta­gram pic­tures to try and court her, with the mo­tive to cheat.</p>
    <p>In her let­ter to Mr Lim dated Oct 7, she said she al­most sent close to $5,000 in cash which the man had asked her to trans­fer to his bank ac­count, but had de­cided to hold back and do some checks on him. It was then that she found out she had nearly fallen for the con­man’s ruse.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Sun­day Times, Ms Inayah, who lives in Cen­tral Java and works for the En­vi­ron­ment Min­istry, said the scam­mer had ini­tially reached out to her over Google Hang­outs.</p>
    <p>He in­tro­duced him­self as “Si­mon Hyanth Lim”, and told tall tales about his life us­ing a false pro­file on In­sta­gram with the han­dle si­mon-hycinth.</p>
    <p>This pro­file, which has since been re­moved, was filled with pho­tos ap­par­ently pilfered from Mr Lim’s pub­lic In­sta­gram pro­file, si­mon­lim.per­son­al­ity, to con­vince Ms Inayah of his le­git­i­macy.</p>
    <p>Over sev­eral weeks, the man fed Ms Inayah ran­dom de­tails, telling her he was a 50-year-old Sin­ga­porean marine en­gi­neer liv­ing in Bri­tain. He also told Ms Inayah that he had re­cently di­vorced his wife, and that he had “in­her­ited” a com­pany from his late fa­ther.</p>
    <p>The scam­mer kept on en­gag­ing the sin­gle mother of one in chats over What­sApp, call­ing her his “queen” and show­er­ing her with love and af­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>He also promised to visit her in In­done­sia, and even sent pho­to­graphs of Mr Lim – also taken from the DJ’s pub­lic pro­file – as “up­dates” on how his day was go­ing.</p>
    <p>“I thought that he was re­ally hand­some and we con­tin­ued to talk, but</p>
    <p>I was alarmed when he re­fused to show his face over video call,” said Ms Inayah in English.</p>
    <p>The scam­mer then started to de­mand money from her – first ask­ing her early last month to trans­fer</p>
    <p>$5,000 to him to pur­chase ma­te­ri­als for an en­gi­neer­ing project in the Bri­tish town of Rochester.</p>
    <p>When she re­fused, telling the man that she did not earn enough and had to care for her four-yearold son, the scam­mer scaled down the amount and asked her to trans­fer $100 a week later, to a Nige­rian bank ac­count. She did not do so.</p>
    <p>Ms Inayah said: “I didn’t get the chance to con­front him be­cause he blocked me.”</p>
    <p>When con­tacted, Mr Lim told The Sun­day Times it was not the first time he had spot­ted fake pro­files of him­self on­line, adding that he found it “re­ally scary” to have his iden­tity stolen and his pho­tos used to “cat­fish” some­one for money.</p>
    <p>“I thought that I could live with fake pro­files of my­self pop­ping up once in a while, if there was no harm done. But when I re­alised what had hap­pened, I felt an­gry with this im­pos­tor – it was eth­i­cally wrong.</p>
    <p>“Any­one ask­ing you for money should raise red flags,” Mr Lim said, adding that he hoped Ms Inayah had found peace and clo­sure af­ter her brush with the con­man.</p>
    <p>“I hope this episode will not make her feel jaded about life and love, and pre­vent her from giv­ing some­one gen­uine a chance.”</p>
