    <p>• He once played the guitar in a band called Ugly Ru­mours and hosted Brit­pop’s lead­ing lights at 10 Down­ing Street.</p>
    <p>Now, former Bri­tish prime min­is­ter Tony Blair (right) is the sub­ject of an opera with a colour­ful cast of char­ac­ters.</p>
    <p>Tony! ( A Tony Blair Rock Opera), writ­ten by co­me­dian Harry Hill, will be per­formed next year at the Tur­bine The­atre next to Bat­tersea Power Sta­tion.</p>
    <p>The the­atre called the show, set to open in Fe­bru­ary, “a reck­less reap­praisal” of the life of the Labour Party’s most suc­cess­ful leader, who was in power from 1997 to 2007.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic­ity for the spec­ta­cle says it is “the story of how one man went from peace-lov­ing, long-haired hippy and would-be pop star to war­mon­ger­ing mil­lion­aire in just a cou­ple of decades”.</p>
    <p>The story plays “fast and loose with the facts, ow­ing as much to Ci­ti­zen Kane as it does to The Marx Broth­ers – Karl and Grou­cho”, it added.</p>
    <p>Char­ac­ters set to fea­ture in­clude Mr Blair’s wife, Cherie, his com­bat­ive press sec­re­tary Alas­tair Camp­bell, former Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and former United States pres­i­dent Ge­orge W. Bush.</p>
    <p>De­pic­tions of Princess Diana, former Iraqi dic­ta­tor Sad­dam Hus­sein and former Bri­tish prime min­is­ter Gor­don Brown – Mr Blair’s dour fi­nance min­is­ter and suc­ces­sor – will also ap­pear on stage.</p>
    <p>Mr Blair, now 67, be­came Bri­tain’s youngest prime min­is­ter since Lord Liver­pool in 1812, when he won a land­slide elec­tion vic­tory in 1997 aged 43, end­ing 18 years of un­bro­ken Con­ser­va­tive rule.</p>
    <p>He was ini­tially pop­u­lar, in­tro­duc­ing so­cial and eco­nomic re­forms, with a me­dia-savvy ap­proach, which in­cluded de­scrib­ing Princess Diana as “the peo­ple’s princess” af­ter her death in 1997.</p>
    <p>But crit­ics have still not for­given his sup­port for Mr Bush’s “War on Ter­ror” and in­va­sion of Iraq to oust Sad­dam, who was ex­e­cuted in 2006.</p>
    <p>Since leav­ing of­fice, Mr Blair has been a Mid­dle East en­voy and set up his own foun­da­tion on reli­gion, cli­mate change and Africa. But he has been crit­i­cised for ac­cept­ing lu­cra­tive pri­vate-sec­tor work, in­clud­ing for au­to­crats.</p>
    <p>The opera is not the first spoof about the former prime min­is­ter. Bri­tain’s Chan­nel 4 tele­vi­sion in 2006 broad­cast Tony Blair: Rock Star about his early mu­si­cal am­bi­tion.</p>
