    <p>Pop­u­lar Ja­panese ac­tor Ken­taro Ito, star of the drama Tokyo Love Story 2020, was ar­rested yes­ter­day for a hit-and-run ac­ci­dent that left two peo­ple in­jured.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old is al­leged to have been be­hind the wheel of a car that struck a mo­tor­cy­cle at an in­ter­sec­tion near the Ja­pan Na­tional Sta­dium just be­fore 6pm on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>In the ac­ci­dent in Tokyo’s Shibuya ward, two mo­tor­cy­cle rid­ers were in­jured – a 26-year-old man had light in­juries to his arm, while a 27-yearold woman broke her leg.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese me­dia cited sources from the Hara­juku Po­lice Sta­tion as say­ing that Ito has con­fessed to the al­le­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>“It is not wrong that the ve­hi­cle I was driv­ing had struck a mo­tor­cy­cle, in­jur­ing peo­ple,” he was quoted as say­ing. “It is also not wrong that I fled the scene af­ter the ac­ci­dent.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter driv­ing away from the scene, Ito was chased down by an­other driver who had wit­nessed the col­li­sion and en­cour­aged Ito to re­turn to the site.</p>
    <p>No al­co­hol was de­tected in Ito’s blood, Ja­panese me­dia said, cit­ing po­lice sources.</p>
    <p>The ac­tor was taken in for ques­tion­ing on Wed­nes­day night and ar­rested yes­ter­day just af­ter 10am on sus­pi­cions of a hit-and-run ac­ci­dent, caus­ing in­jury.</p>
    <p>By Ja­panese law, the po­lice can de­tain a sus­pect for up to 23 days upon ar­rest be­fore pros­e­cu­tors de­cide whether to file charges.</p>
    <p>The ar­rest of Ito, who made his act­ing de­but in 2014 and had for­merly ap­peared as a com­men­ta­tor on the Net­flix re­al­ity show Ter­race House, was the trend­ing topic on Twit­ter in Ja­pan yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>His man­age­ment agency, in a state­ment to the JNN News Net­work, apol­o­gised to the two vic­tims, as well as for caus­ing worry and in­con­ve­nienc­ing the pub­lic. It added that it was check­ing the facts of the case.</p>
    <p>Ito plays the lead role in two up­com­ing movies – the man­gaadapted com­edy Tonkatsu DJ Age­taro and the pe­riod com­edy drama Ju­ni­hi­toe Wo Kita Akuma (loosely trans­lated as “Devil wear­ing the Ju­ni­hi­toe for­mal robe”), which pre­mieres in Ja­pan next Fri­day.</p>
    <p>While Tonkatsu DJ Age­taro will be re­leased in Ja­pan to­day as planned, the re­lease date of the se­cond movie is now up in the air.</p>
