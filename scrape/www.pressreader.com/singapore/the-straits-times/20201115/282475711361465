    <p>Two pas­try shops are set to open in the com­ing months, with Sin­ga­pore­ans at the helm.</p>
    <p>What is dif­fer­ent about Le Matin Patisserie and Tigerlily Patisserie is that they are al­ready winning fans with their pas­try boxes, sold on­line for de­liv­ery or self-col­lec­tion.</p>
    <p>The way business is done in the Covid-19 pandemic has changed. En­tre­pre­neur­ial, nim­ble bak­ers and cooks can test the mar­ket first with­out spend­ing a lot of cap­i­tal, and gauge re­sponse be­fore open­ing a brick-and-mor­tar shop. Some never go on to open those shops.</p>
    <p>And this is what sets the two pas­try chefs, Mo­hamed Al-Matin and Max­ine Ngooi, apart from the rest. They do not have vague plans to do so “some­time in the fu­ture”.</p>
    <p>They are se­ri­ous about lo­ca­tions and time­lines.</p>
    <p>Maybe it is be­cause Sin­ga­pore­ans are trapped here and un­able to travel. Maybe they went stir-crazy dur­ing the stay-in pe­riod and needed cheer­ing up. Maybe they just like pas­tries.</p>
    <p>But boxes from both pas­try chefs have been wildly pop­u­lar. Le Matin’s boxes, the lat­est of which costs a princely $59 for five pas­tries, have been snapped up within five min­utes of be­ing re­leased on­line.</p>
    <p>It is the same story with Tigerlily’s boxes – there is a sweet one with four pas­tries for $35 and a savoury box with four pas­tries for $25. Cus­tomers angst over get­ting one box, but fail­ing to snag the other.</p>
    <p>Le Matin is named for the chef be­hind it. He is the mid­dle child of three. His en­gi­neer fa­ther is In­di­anMus­lim and his mother, Chi­nese.</p>
    <p>That “matin” also means “morn­ing” in French is too de­li­cious not to show­case. Morn­ing, pre­sum­ably, is when peo­ple want to wolf down his Kouign-amann and crois­sants.</p>
    <p>Man­power woes have stymied plans for his bak­ers to work from mid­night to morn­ing, to have pas­tries ready for break­fast. Some of his cus­tomers gripe about get­ting their boxes in the even­ing.</p>
    <p>“They say I should call the business Le Soir,” he says, us­ing the French term for the even­ing. The es­car­got, cruffins and galettes are very good post-din­ner treats, it must be said.</p>
    <p>Tigerlily’s chef Ngooi got in­ter­ested in cook­ing and bak­ing while watch­ing her Por­tuguese-Eurasian mother cook. It was her mother who sug­gested she wrap the Per­anakanstyl­e fill­ing for her sausage roll in caul fat.</p>
    <p>The name for her business re­flects her love of botan­i­cals, and the tiger is a nod to her spine of steel.</p>
    <p>She says: “It’s fem­i­nine and fierce, like me. You need to be fierce to hold your ground in the kitchen. From day one at Les Amis, I felt it.”</p>
    <p>To be sure, it is tempt­ing to point out the sim­i­lar­i­ties be­tween them.</p>
    <p>They are both mid­dle chil­dren. Ngooi’s fa­ther is a re­tired banker, her mother a house­wife.</p>
    <p>They both stud­ied and worked in Aus­tralia. Both paid their dues, work­ing in Miche­lin-starred restau­rants here and over­seas. Mo­hamed Al-Matin was pas­try sous chef at Noma in Copenhagen for two years.</p>
    <p>The two chefs have that at­ten­tion to de­tail that is a pre-req­ui­site for pas­try chefs.</p>
    <p>Watch­ing him line up ed­i­ble flow­ers and leaves on sheets of parch­ment, quickly and metic­u­lously, to be laid on one of his lat­est pas­tries, is to marvel at how he has re­cov­ered from an ac­ci­dent that al­most de­stroyed his right hand.</p>
    <p>Her fo­cus is in­tense. The deft­ness when rolling out pas­try be­lies the fact that she did not go to culi­nary school.</p>
    <p>They both want to open dessert restau­rants, but not right away be­cause that is an idea whose time might not have come in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>But their ap­proach to flavours is dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>She flirts with Asian ones. There is that curry sausage roll, the gin­ger flower in a fig galette brushed with ly­chee honey and the mochi in the blondie.</p>
    <p>His fo­cus is de­cid­edly Euro­pean, cloud­ber­ries in the lemon ver­bena tart, green­gage plums on his galette when they were in sea­son. One of his sig­na­ture bakes is the Kouig­na­mann, a Bre­ton pas­try rich with but­ter.</p>
    <p>They are both vy­ing for space in your belly. But don’t even talk about com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>He says: “I’m do­ing what I do now be­cause I want peo­ple to eat tasty food. This is not about com­pe­ti­tion.”</p>
    <p>It can­not be dif­fi­cult to make room for ex­quis­ite pas­tries from the two of them, can it?</p>
