    <p>Even as peo­ple slowly re­turn to shop­ping malls for a qui­eter fes­tive sea­son, re­tail­ers are feel­ing the pain from more than half a year of zero or lit­tle foot traf­fic and less in­come. The re­tail sec­tor saw a 10-month high record in busi­ness clo­sures in Septem­ber, with 457 com­pa­nies shut­ter­ing for good. The sight of hoard­ing at malls is be­com­ing an in­creas­ingly fa­mil­iar, and de­press­ing, sight. Yet there can be new op­por­tu­ni­ties dur­ing these calami­tous times.</p>
    <p>In New York City, non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion Chashama has been match­mak­ing empty shopfronts with artists so that the lat­ter can dis­play their works for sale. Land­lords might not re­ceive rents, but vi­brant art is an im­prove­ment over hol­low hoard­ing and could liven up the place. Artists who are in dire need of plat­forms to high­light their works can also earn in­come to ame­lio­rate the pan­demic’s toll on their fi­nances.</p>
    <p>This sort of syn­ergy has also driven an ini­tia­tive in Mel­bourne where the West Side Place ar­cade has been trans­formed into an “art­cade”. The im­mer­sive pub­lic art gallery, with in­stal­la­tions by con­tem­po­rary and street artists, aims to draw foot traf­fic back to a Cen­tral Busi­ness District area dec­i­mated by pan­demic re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore could draw in­spi­ra­tion from these over­seas ini­tia­tives. There are prece­dents for such col­lab­o­ra­tions. The Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity al­ready has in place a Com­mu­nity/ Sports Fa­cil­i­ties Scheme which of­fers de­vel­op­ers the op­por­tu­nity to add to their gross floor area with spa­ces ded­i­cated to com­mu­nity out­reach uses. Wild Rice’s the­atre at Fu­nan mall is an ex­am­ple of this scheme at work, with foot traf­fic to the the­atre and mall ben­e­fit­ing from the co-lo­ca­tion. Ex­pand­ing such ini­tia­tives could re­ju­ve­nate cur­rently mori­bund re­tail spa­ces, of­fer artists a much needed plat­form as well as en­cour­age a gen­eral ap­pre­ci­a­tion of the arts.</p>
