    <p>Liver­pool are only three games into their Premier League ti­tle de­fence but their stut­ter­ing ri­vals must get their acts to­gether if they are go­ing to pre­vent an An­field pro­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>Jurgen Klopp’s side have an­swered ques­tions about their ap­petite for more suc­cess after win­ning the club’s first English ti­tle for 30 years. Fol­low­ing their chaotic open­ing 4-3 win against Leeds, the Reds have reeled off a pair of im­pres­sive vic­to­ries against Chelsea (2-0) and Arsenal (3-1) to ex­tend their per­fect start to the sea­son.</p>
    <p>A slightly be­low-par de­fen­sive ef­fort against Leeds seems to have sharp­ened Liver­pool’s fo­cus.</p>
    <p>They were back to their ruthless best as they dis­patched big-spend­ing Chelsea at Stam­ford Bridge be­fore brush­ing aside Arsenal after the Gun­ners had the temer­ity to take the lead at An­field.</p>
    <p>The ad­di­tions of Thi­ago Al­can­tara and Diogo Jota have given Liver­pool even more thrust and poise in mid­field and at­tack – a fright­en­ing thought for their ri­vals given the Reds scored 85 goals in 38 league games last sea­son.</p>
    <p>Ahead of their trip to As­ton Villa to­day, Klopp in­sisted he ex­pects Liver­pool to be pushed all the way to the fin­ish line.</p>
    <p>“It’s an open race, Chelsea will be there, (Manch­ester) United will be there, Arsenal, Tot­ten­ham, these teams will al­ways be there,” he said. “There are tough mo­ments for us and other teams and it’s about how you re­act and are you do­ing it in the right way?</p>
    <p>“It’s a marathon, not a sprint, and you have to go through a lot of mo­ments. I have no idea who will win but I know a lot of teams will try.”</p>
    <p>But pri­vately, Klopp is aware that Liver­pool’s bid to de­fend the ti­tle for the first time since 1984 will be greatly en­hanced if their chal­lengers can­not ad­dress their own short­com­ings.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool for­ward Sa­dio Mane, mean­while, has be­come the sec­ond player from the club to test pos­i­tive for Covid-19 this week.</p>
    <p>The Reds said on Fri­day the Sene­galese, who scored in Mon­day’s win over Arsenal, has dis­played mi­nor symp­toms of the coro­n­avirus but feels in good health over­all.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, mid­fielder Thi­ago tested pos­i­tive and was also re­ported to be dis­play­ing mi­nor symp­toms.</p>
