    <p>MUM­BAI • Bol­ly­wood star and for­mer Miss World Aish­warya Rai Bachchan and her daugh­ter have been dis­charged from a Mum­bai hospi­tal where they were be­ing treated for coro­n­avirus, her ac­tor hus­band Ab­hishek Bachchan said on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The pair was ad­mit­ted to hospi­tal about a week ago, sev­eral days af­ter Ab­hishek and his su­per­star fa­ther Amitabh Bachchan, mak­ing them the high­est-pro­file fam­ily to con­tract the virus in In­dia, which has recorded more than 1.4 mil­lion cases.</p>
    <p>“Aish­warya and Aarad­hya have thank­fully tested neg­a­tive and have been dis­charged from the hospi­tal. They will now be at home,” her hus­band tweeted, thank­ing fans for “con­tin­ued prayers and good wishes”.</p>
    <p>“My fa­ther and I re­main in hospi­tal un­der the care of the med­i­cal staff,” he added.</p>
    <p>The 46-year-old ac­tress and her eight-year-old daugh­ter, Aarad­hya, were ini­tially quar­an­tined at home be­fore be­ing moved to the same hospi­tal where her 77-year-old fa­ther-in-law and his son are be­ing treated for the ill­ness.</p>
    <p>Aish­warya won the Miss World crown in 1994, and has be­come one of Bol­ly­wood’s most fa­mous faces. She is a reg­u­lar on the red car­pet at the Cannes Film Fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>The elder Bachchan and his 44-year-old son Ab­hishek are both in the iso­la­tion ward.</p>
    <p>No health up­date has been is­sued since they were ad­mit­ted more than two weeks ago, but Amitabh, an avid so­cial me­dia user, has been dis­pens­ing reg­u­lar mes­sages to his mil­lions of fans on Twit­ter, In­sta­gram and Tum­blr.</p>
    <p>“I couldn’t hold back my tears”, he tweeted late on Mon­day, re­count­ing his re­ac­tion to the news that his grand­daugh­ter and daugh­ter-in-law could now go home.</p>
    <p>A blog en­try posted ear­lier last Satur­day touched on the men­tal trauma and stigma suf­fered by coro­n­avirus pa­tients, re­fer­ring to “the stark re­al­ity that the Covid pa­tient, put in hos­pi­talised iso­la­tion, never gets to see an­other hu­man”.</p>
    <p>Re­cov­ered pa­tients “are afraid to be in public for fear or ap­pre­hen­sion of be­ing treated dif­fer­ently... treated as one that has car­ried the dis­ease... a pariah syn­drome... driv­ing them into deeper de­pres­sion”, he wrote.</p>
    <p>Amitabh Bachchan, idolised in In­dia, has worked for more than half a cen­tury in the film in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Mum­bai, In­dia’s fi­nan­cial and film cap­i­tal, has now recorded over 100,000 cases, with more than 6,000 deaths at­trib­uted to the virus.</p>
