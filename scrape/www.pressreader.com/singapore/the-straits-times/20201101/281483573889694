    <p>In the mat­ter of hearts, my mother fig­u­ra­tively has a big one and lit­er­ally an en­larged one. The first brings a smile, the sec­ond re­cently left her breath­less. Late one Septem­ber night in In­dia, an am­bu­lance had to be called to her gate for she was gasp­ing for air.</p>
    <p>There was an is­sue with the stretcher so Raghu­bir, 48, my mother’s cook for nearly 30 years, scooped her tiny, 87-year-old body into his arms, like a man cradling a half-bro­ken flower, and car­ried her to the am­bu­lance. Then, as she lay rest­less, he stayed close for the long ride. He’s not a man of words but he was telling her: I am here.</p>
    <p>The Dalai Lama would like Raghu­bir be­cause he be­lieves his re­li­gion is kind­ness. Still, the act of giv­ing, with praise not ex­pected, star­tles us for it’s al­most too in­no­cent for th­ese times. And yet I didn’t com­pletely fathom the power of kind­ness till I felt it my­self, when weeks later, on Oct 10, my mother was left twisted by a stroke.</p>
    <p>Fear comes in many forms. In Ernest Hem­ing­way’s book, Death In The Af­ter­noon, he writes: “Nearly all bull­fight­ers are brave and yet nearly all bull­fight­ers are fright­ened at some mo­ment be­fore the fight be­gins.” I know only this, that all of us chil­dren, who live away from our fam­i­lies, are fright­ened by the idea of The Call. It comes from miles away, from a par­ents’ home town, and it will still you. The feared has be­come real.</p>
    <p>Grief has a cruel, mod­ern twist. Covid-19 has closed bor­ders, halted flights, seg­re­gated fam­i­lies and the virus has di­vided us even as it repli­cates. Dehra Dun, where my mother re­sides, is roughly 4,400km away and yet it feels like one of the Moons of Jupiter.</p>
    <p>There are rules and tests, ap­provals and ex­emp­tions, forms and quar­an­tine, too few evac­u­a­tion flights and too much math­e­mat­ics. How long is a test valid? When does the va­lid­ity be­gin? Re­mem­ber Hugh Grant go­ing “bug­ger, bug­ger, bug­ger” in Four Wed­dings And A Fu­neral? That’s me last month but us­ing a less print­able word.</p>
    <p>Stress is like a thug which has its fore­arm against my throat. My ticket comes but not my ap­proval for a test be­cause I had only ap­plied as the week­end be­gan. Do you know what wait­ing feels like? Like heat from a can­dle lick­ing your hand harder and harder.</p>
    <p>The ap­proval comes but I won’t get my Covid-19 test re­sults in time, so I change my ticket, fill new air­port forms, do the test, exit the clinic a day later with the re­sults and a text ar­rives: Flight to In­dia is can­celled. I go home and my best friend lis­tens to me cry. Part of kind­ness is wear­ing an­other’s grief.</p>
    <p>But this isn’t a col­umn about sad­ness, but about de­cency. About peo­ple who recog­nised I needed a hand. About the faith which emerges from kind­ness. Like the taxi driver in Sin­ga­pore, who hears me talk to a friend about whether I should leave my fridge on for the two months I will be away. Later he tells me: “Leave it on. I know, I used to be a me­chanic.”</p>
    <p>Then, he adds: “Good luck with your mother.”</p>
    <p>I had ar­rived at my friend Rad­hika’s flat and she was go­ing to In­dia, too, for her mother was ail­ing, but still she heard my dis­tress and called me over and helped me fill Delhi air­port forms. The forms are not com­pli­cated but</p>
    <p>If we won­der what ties us to­gether, then of­ten it is this. A small word. A tiny act. A thread of con­nec­tion. It is as el­e­men­tal as stop­ping to pick up some­one’s dropped pa­pers. If we walked by, it means we do not see each other.</p>
    <p>my clar­ity had long passed and so she put aside her anx­i­ety to in­dulge mine.</p>
    <p>Kind­ness is not an en­ti­tle­ment and yet it is one of the grand hu­man of­fer­ings we can make to one an­other. Here, take. At its finest it asks for noth­ing, there is no deal in­volved, no agree­ment, just a one-sided giv­ing.</p>
    <p>If we won­der what ties us to­gether, then of­ten it is this. A small word. A tiny act. A thread of con­nec­tion. It is as el­e­men­tal as stop­ping to pick up some­one’s dropped pa­pers. If we walked by, it means we do not see each other.</p>
    <p>There is no time, we think, to recog­nise each other as peo­ple. So much eas­ier to re­duce each other to a case num­ber. But to in­ter­act with­out feel­ing is to steal a lit­tle hu­man­ity from our­selves. On the day my mother was dis­charged, the over­worked at­ten­dant at the hos­pi­tal phar­macy darted down one floor to the store­room to find me ex­tra cans of pro­tein pow­der. He re­fused to see me as a trans­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>We’re mostly a petty world th­ese days of cor­roded com­pas­sion and so the kind­ness I re­ceive is like a reaf­fir­ma­tion of good­ness. It’s like a trickle of ten­der­ness.</p>
    <p>There are the peo­ple on the hot­line of Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of Health who I call to check about my ap­proval let­ter. They ex­press con­cern, they say it’s be­ing ex­pe­dited, they lis­ten and are never curt. Just their tone helps. I dare not com­plain any­way for every­one in line for an ap­proval for a test has their own story.</p>
    <p>There is the man at the tran­sit counter at Dubai air­port – I fly to In­dia via the Gulf – who painstak­ingly pe­ruses my forms and then says: “Hope your mother gets bet­ter.” It’s noth­ing, you say. No, it is some­thing. His job is ef­fi­ciency, but he’s gone five words be­yond it. Maybe, as some­one’s child, he un­der­stands. Or maybe it’s how I choose to see it.</p>
    <p>There is the clinic which does my test, the Bis­han Grace Clinic, a name I pick ran­domly from a list, where the staff is re­spon­sive, prac­ti­cal, pa­tient, flex­i­ble. All the things peo­ple re­quire in a cri­sis. When my flight is can­celled and I won­der if I need ap­proval again for an­other test, they check for me. I lean on their con­cern.</p>
    <p>There are my friends, who look for so­lu­tions, who prom­ise to take care of my flat, who travel miles across Delhi to meet me at the air­port just to talk for four min­utes and give me sand­wiches for my on­ward road trip. You might say this is the nat­u­ral ex­ten­sion of friend­ship, but it isn’t al­ways. There is plat­i­tude and there is ac­tion. My mother once raised an eye­brow and told me, “I’m not quite sure how you have such won­der­ful friends”.</p>
    <p>There is an of­ten-told story from 1939 about base­ball player Lou Gehrig, who is dy­ing from a dis­ease which will be named af­ter him. He’s 36 and leav­ing the game and in a leg­endary speech, he talks to the 61,000 Yan­kee fans about the fine men he played with and says: “For the past two weeks, you have been read­ing about a bad break. Yet, to­day I con­sider my­self the luck­i­est man on the face of the earth.”</p>
    <p>I am lucky, too, for I couldn’t have come so far with­out peo­ple mak­ing a bridge for me. Maybe there was a con­struc­tion worker, go­ing home to see a dy­ing fa­ther, whose flight got can­celled, and were peo­ple as kind to him?</p>
    <p>In my mother’s town, two close cousins and a fine friend have been in­de­fati­ga­bly tak­ing care of her. A sort of re­lent­less love. I am learn­ing about giv­ing and un­der­stand­ing the power of duty and now I feel like a man with a bril­liant debt.</p>
    <p>Win­ter is start­ing to flirt and in­stead of plant­ing nas­tur­tiums, my mother sits in a wheel­chair in her gar­den and asks: “Will I ever walk again?” Her spirit has been roughed up. A doc­tor friend has left his own age­ing fa­ther to come and pa­tiently tu­tor us on chang­ing urine bags and us­ing a mu­cus ex­trac­tor. My mother, fed through a tube, has been plead­ing for days for Coke of all things, and the doc­tor, who can see her mul­ti­ple strug­gles, says “Yes”.</p>
    <p>Very lit­tle in a glass, he says, let the gas es­cape, use a straw, let’s see if she can swal­low it. She slurps, she sips and a hint of a smile licks her lips. This is good medicine. This is hu­man medicine. This is kind­ness.</p>
