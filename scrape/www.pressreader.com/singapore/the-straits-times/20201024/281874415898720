    <p>CORO­N­AVIRUS</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump: We’re round­ing the cor­ner. It’s go­ing away. I caught it. I learnt a lot… We have to re­cover. We can’t close up our na­tion. Demo­cratic nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den: This is the same fel­low who told you this is go­ing to end by Easter last time. This is the same fel­low who told you that, don’t worry, we’re go­ing to end this by the sum­mer. We’re about to go into a dark win­ter, a dark win­ter, and he has no clear plan.</p>
    <p>CHINA</p>
    <p>Mr Trump: China is pay­ing (the tar­iffs)... I just gave US$28 bil­lion (S$38 bil­lion) to our farm­ers. China paid US$28 bil­lion, and you know what they did to pay it, Joe, they de­val­ued their cur­rency and they also paid up... You never charged them any­thing. Mr Bi­den: We need to be hav­ing the rest of our friends with us say­ing to China: Th­ese are the rules. You play by them or you’re go­ing to pay the price for not play­ing by them, eco­nom­i­cally.</p>
    <p>RACE RELATIONS</p>
    <p>Mr Trump: I am the least racist per­son in this room... No­body has done more for the black com­mu­nity than Don­ald Trump. If you look, with the ex­cep­tion of Abra­ham Lin­coln, pos­si­ble ex­cep­tion, no­body has done what I’ve done.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den: (Trump) pours fuel on ev­ery sin­gle racist fire. Ev­ery sin­gle one.</p>
    <p>CLI­MATE CHANGE</p>
    <p>Mr Trump: The Paris ac­cord. I took us out be­cause we were go­ing to have to spend tril­lions of dol­lars and we were treated very un­fairly… It would have de­stroyed our busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den: Four more years of this man, elim­i­nat­ing all the reg­u­la­tions that were put in by us to clean up the cli­mate… will put us in a po­si­tion where we are go­ing to be in real trou­ble.</p>
