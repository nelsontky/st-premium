    <p>Po­lit­i­cal tem­per­a­tures in Malaysia rose yes­ter­day ahead of op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim’s meet­ing with the King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ri’ay­atud­din, over his bid to wrest con­trol of the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Moves by the po­lice yes­ter­day to ques­tion Datuk Seri An­war over spec­u­la­tion in so­cial me­dia about which MPs sup­ported his bid to wrest power from Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s ad­min­is­tra­tion were seen by some pun­dits as po­lit­i­cally-mo­ti­vated.</p>
    <p>The po­lice post­poned the in­ter­view to a date to be de­ter­mined later, af­ter Mr An­war of­fered to go in this morn­ing, ahead of his au­di­ence with the King.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the gov­ern­ment’s an­nounce­ment of strict move­ment re­stric­tions in the cen­tral Se­lan­gor state – which in­cludes Kuala Lumpur and the ad­min­is­tra­tive cap­i­tal Pu­tra­jaya – to curb soar­ing coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions found quick op­po­si­tion from the state gov­ern­ment, which is con­trolled by Mr An­war’s Pakatan Hara­pan coali­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war, 73, is sched­uled to meet Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah at 10am to­day to present him with doc­u­men­ta­tion and let­ters of sup­port from MPs to back up his claims of se­cur­ing a for­mi­da­ble ma­jor­ity to form the next gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Should Mr An­war fail in his bid to con­vince the King of the sup­port he claims, the loom­ing po­lit­i­cal cri­sis will fiz­zle out, leav­ing the op­po­si­tion leader with a cred­i­bil­ity cri­sis that he is un­likely to re­cover from.</p>
    <p>But should he suc­ceed, Malaysian pol­i­tics will be pushed into ter­ri­tory not ex­pe­ri­enced since in­de­pen­dence in 1957.</p>
    <p>Be­cause Par­lia­ment will not re­con­vene un­til some time later this month, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah, whose powers are largely cer­e­mo­nial un­der the fed­eral Con­sti­tu­tion, will have the ul­ti­mate say on how the cri­sis will be resolved – at a time when Malaysia is fac­ing both un­prece­dented po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>Close as­so­ciates of Mr An­war, who are di­rectly in­volved in this cam­paign to wrest power, said that con­sti­tu­tional ex­perts have sug­gested the mat­ter could play out in a num­ber of ways.</p>
    <p>As­sum­ing Mr An­war con­vinces the King that he does pos­sess a healthy ma­jor­ity – said by his as­so­ciates to num­ber at least 120 MPs – in the 222-mem­ber Lower House, Tan Sri Muhyid­din would then be sum­moned to the Palace, and what hap­pens next will be cru­cial.</p>
    <p>A smooth han­dover un­der the King’s guid­ance would be the pre­ferred out­come, with Mr Muhyid­din con­ced­ing that he no longer en­joys the ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Un­der these cir­cum­stances, Mr An­war could be ap­pointed as Malaysia’s ninth premier be­fore the week is out.</p>
    <p>The other prospect would be for the King to ap­prove the dis­so­lu­tion of Par­lia­ment to pave the way for fresh polls, a prospect that an­a­lysts say could have dis­as­trous reper­cus­sions fol­low­ing the lat­est spike in Covid-19 cases that has been traced to cam­paign­ing dur­ing the re­cent Sabah state election.</p>
