    <p>The Elec­tions Depart­ment (ELD) has ac­knowl­edged short­com­ings in the con­duct of polling at this year’s Gen­eral Elec­tion. In do­ing so, it has re­flected on the high stan­dards that it set for it­self and main­tained con­sis­tently in en­abling the most im­por­tant demo­cratic ex­er­cise in Sin­ga­pore to take place. Ob­vi­ously, this year’s elec­tion was spe­cial by any ac­count be­cause it was held amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. Pub­lic health con­cerns were the fore­most chal­lenge be­cause it would have been a so­cial dis­as­ter had polling led to a sig­nif­i­cant out­break of Covid-19 hitting Sin­ga­pore. How­ever, there was a need to hold the polls so that Sin­ga­pore­ans could choose a gov­ern­ment with the man­date to act de­ci­sively to steer the coun­try through and out of the crisis. It fell on the ELD to bal­ance the needs of safety and democ­racy in what was per­haps a most un­usual elec­tion.</p>
    <p>It fared well over­all. In a sur­vey, seven out of 10 vot­ers polled said they were sat­is­fied with their ex­pe­ri­ence at polling sta­tions. How­ever, those who had voted at schools and com­mu­nity cen­tres or clubs, which housed polling sta­tions with more vot­ers, reg­is­tered a poorer vot­ing ex­pe­ri­ence be­cause of the length of time that it took to cast their bal­lots. A 70 per cent sat­is­fac­tion rate in the midst of a pan­demic-hit elec­tion is not a bad result. And it is worth not­ing that the much talked about post-elec­tion surge of virus cases never hap­pened.</p>
    <p>But the ELD has, rightly, also fo­cused on the re­main­ing 30 per cent, ask­ing it­self what could have been done bet­ter. This is im­por­tant, not least since some have won­dered if the queues at some polling sta­tions put off vot­ers suf­fi­ciently to swing their votes. That would be un­for­tu­nate, for demo­cratic choices that could shape the coun­try’s fu­ture should surely turn on more sig­nif­i­cant mat­ters than the time taken in a queue.</p>
    <p>The depart­ment has iden­ti­fied four ar­eas for at­ten­tion in the vot­ing process. One was the de­lay in vot­ing caused by the in­tro­duc­tion of safe-man­age­ment mea­sures, nec­es­sary though they were. Then, large polling sta­tions should have been re­sourced bet­ter. Size com­bined with the pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures must have ag­gra­vated the sit­u­a­tion. More­over, voter turnout was not spread out evenly across the vot­ing hours. For ex­am­ple, time-bands in the morn­ing were al­lo­cated to se­nior vot­ers, but one-third of vot­ers in the morn­ing were not se­niors. Then again, there were is­sues with e-reg­is­tra­tion de­vices.</p>
    <p>The ELD has set out sev­eral im­prove­ments that it will make to pro­cesses in the fu­ture. These in­clude boost­ing man­power and equip­ment al­lo­cated to polling sta­tions and re­duc­ing the num­ber of vot­ers at large polling sta­tions. These should help en­sure that elec­tions in Sin­ga­pore are marked not only by trans­parency but also by the ef­fi­ciency that vot­ers have come to ex­pect.</p>
