    <p>BEI­JING • China’s in­dus­trial out­put last month ac­cel­er­ated the most in eight months, while re­tail sales grew for the first time this year, sug­gest­ing the eco­nomic re­cov­ery is gath­er­ing pace as de­mand starts to im­prove more broadly from the coro­n­avirus crisis.</p>
    <p>An an­nual de­cline in fixed-as­set in­vest­ment over Jan­uary to last month also mod­er­ated, ow­ing to gov­ern­ment stim­u­lus ef­forts, but the au­thor­i­ties re­main wary about the out­look, given height­ened external risks, in­clud­ing from in­ten­si­fy­ing United States-China ten­sions.</p>
    <p>After the pan­demic paral­ysed huge swathes of the econ­omy, China’s re­cov­ery has been gain­ing mo­men­tum as pent-up de­mand, gov­ern­ment stim­u­lus and sur­pris­ingly re­silient ex­ports pro­pel a re­bound.</p>
    <p>“We think that China’s eco­nomic re­cov­ery is on a rea­son­ably firm foot­ing now and should con­tinue through Q4 and into 2021, with solid in­vest­ment growth, grad­u­ally re­cov­er­ing con­sump­tion mo­men­tum and re­silient ex­ports,” said Mr Louis Kuijs of Ox­ford Eco­nom­ics.</p>
    <p>In­dus­trial out­put growth quick­ened to 5.6 per cent last month from a year ear­lier, the fastest gain in eight months, data from the Na­tional Statis­tics Bureau showed yes­ter­day. An­a­lysts polled by Reuters had ex­pected a 5.1 per cent rise from 4.8 per cent in July.</p>
    <p>Re­tail sales also rose 0.5 per cent year on year, snap­ping a seven-month down­turn and beat­ing an­a­lysts’ fore­casts for zero growth. In July, sales fell 1.1 per cent.</p>
    <p>Con­sumer confidence has been pick­ing up lately, from spend­ing on cars and duty-free shop­ping. Auto sales rose 11.8 per cent last month from a year ear­lier, while sales of telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions prod­ucts jumped 25.1 per cent year on year, the data showed.</p>
    <p>The de­cline in fixed-as­set in­vest­ment fell 0.3 per cent over Jan­uary to last month from the same pe­riod last year, com­pared with a fore­cast 0.4 per cent slide and a larger 1.6 per cent de­cline in the first seven months.</p>
    <p>Pri­vate sec­tor fixed-as­set in­vest­ment, which ac­counts for 60 per cent of to­tal in­vest­ment, fell 2.8 per cent in the pe­riod from Jan­uary to last month, com­pared with a 5.7 per cent de­cline in the first seven months of the year.</p>
    <p>Re­cent eco­nomic indicators, from trade to pro­ducer prices and factory ac­tiv­ity, sug­gested a fur­ther pickup in the in­dus­trial sec­tor and the broader econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment stim­u­lus has been a pow­er­ful domestic driver, and mo­men­tum has been supported by Bei­jing’s largely suc­cess­ful ef­forts to get the virus un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>“Fis­cal and mon­e­tary pol­icy stim­u­lus should con­tinue to sup­port the re­cov­ery. But we ex­pect the im­pact of pol­icy stim­u­lus to lose some punch with credit growth eas­ing in Q4,” Mr Kuijs said.</p>
    <p>Data last week showed China’s ex­ports last month mark­ing the strong­est an­nual gain since March last year, as more of its trad­ing part­ners eased coro­n­avirus lock­downs. Factory gate prices also fell at their slow­est an­nual pace in five months last month.</p>
    <p>Some an­a­lysts fear that the re­cov­ery could stall, hurt by ris­ing ten­sions be­tween Wash­ing­ton and Bei­jing, which many ex­pect could es­ca­late ahead of the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>China is also look­ing to re­duce its re­liance on over­seas mar­kets for its de­vel­op­ment as US hos­til­ity and the pan­demic in­crease external risks that could ham­per longer-term progress.</p>
