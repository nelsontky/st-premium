    <p>The in­crease in qual­i­fy­ing salaries for Em­ploy­ment Pass (EP) and S Pass ap­pli­cants will raise costs for some busi­nesses, said ex­perts, who also warned that fur­ther rises could re­duce com­pet­i­tive­ness.</p>
    <p>They added that job seek­ers will have to change their mind­set to­wards cer­tain in­dus­tries that must hire for­eign­ers be­cause lo­cals shun those sec­tors.</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank’s head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy Se­lena Ling noted that the im­pact of the higher qual­i­fy­ing salaries could be more se­vere on sec­tors that hire more S Pass hold­ers such as con­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>She added: “There have been some man­power short­ages in spe­cific fields like pro­gram­mers, cy­ber se­cu­rity and other dig­i­tal skills that are re­quired where it may be dif­fi­cult to plug the gap im­me­di­ately.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion chief ex­ec­u­tive Ho Meng Kit said: “In the immediate term, this move may raise busi­ness costs. We would thus expect more em­ploy­ers to in­crease their ef­forts to look for lo­cals and strengthen the Sin­ga­porean core, and we do hope for this out­come.”</p>
    <p>He added that there is a gap be­tween wage and skills ex­pec­ta­tions that needs to be bridged be­tween em­ploy­ers and mid-ca­reer lo­cal pro­fes­sion­als, so firms should train them while re­tain­ing for­eign­ers to com­ple­ment lo­cal man­power.</p>
    <p>The at­ti­tude of lo­cal job seek­ers will be­come cru­cial, noted em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>Man­u­fac­turer Cer­tact En­gi­neer­ing’s man­ag­ing direc­tor El­lis Eng said: “The root cause is re­ally the is­sue of whether Sin­ga­pore­ans want to take up such jobs.</p>
    <p>“I ad­ver­tised re­cently and in­ter­viewed some can­di­dates, but when they saw that we are a man­u­fac­turer si­t­u­ated in the west, they didn’t take up the job. Sin­ga­pore­ans have to ad­just their ex­pec­ta­tions as well.”</p>
    <p>Ms Eng, who has one EP holder and sev­eral S Pass hold­ers on her staff, said firms have been hard-hit by the pan­demic and this move would drive up op­er­at­ing costs.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Man­u­fac­tur­ing Fed­er­a­tion pres­i­dent Dou­glas Foo also noted that lo­cals need to change their at­ti­tude and be proac­tive in train­ing and up­skilling for growth sec­tors. “Other fac­tors must also not be for­got­ten,” he said. “(Th­ese in­clude) keep­ing salary caps in line with the ris­ing pay of grad­u­ates from our lo­cal uni­ver­si­ties as well as the fact that with our limited do­mes­tic pop­u­la­tion, Sin­ga­pore will not be able to progress as quickly with­out a work­force of for­eign­ers, who in turn con­trib­ute to the larger na­tional econ­omy.”</p>
    <p>Seoul Gar­den Group gen­eral man­ager Garry Lam said his firm does not hire EP hold­ers as they are too ex­pen­sive and it has fewer than 10 S Pass hold­ers.</p>
    <p>“Per­haps the mea­sures shouldn’t ap­ply across all in­dus­tries, be­cause for food ser­vices, not many lo­cals are in­ter­ested and have the im­pres­sion it is a tough job with long hours, which is not true,” he added.</p>
    <p>“They feel if they’re grad­u­ates, they can­not do ser­vice roles.”</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions said they expect the higher qual­i­fy­ing salaries to have min­i­mal im­pact on their op­er­a­tions. The EP salary cri­te­rion will be raised to at least $5,000 for the fi­nan­cial ser­vices sec­tor from Dec 1. This will be the first time the Gov­ern­ment has set higher qual­i­fy­ing salaries for a spe­cific sec­tor.</p>
    <p>A DBS Bank spokesman said the bank sup­ports the Gov­ern­ment’s ef­forts to de­velop a strong pipe­line of lo­cal tal­ent in the fi­nance sec­tor: “We re­main com­mit­ted to hir­ing and de­vel­op­ing a Sin­ga­porean core in our work­force.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ja­son Ho, OCBC Bank’s head of group hu­man re­sources, said: “We look at an ap­pli­cant’s skills, ex­pe­ri­ence and val­ues, rather than their age, gen­der, na­tion­al­ity or race.”</p>
    <p>He added that the bank has var­i­ous train­ing and devel­op­ment pro­grammes to reskill staff and groom fu­ture lead­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr James Lee, Great Eastern man­ag­ing direc­tor of group hu­man cap­i­tal, said the in­surer is cre­at­ing cor­po­rate job op­por­tu­ni­ties through the SGUnited Trainee­ships Pro­gramme. He added that all its fi­nan­cial ad­vi­sory staff are lo­cal.</p>
    <p>Cit­i­zens and per­ma­nent res­i­dents make up about 90 per cent of all three com­pa­nies’ work­force in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
