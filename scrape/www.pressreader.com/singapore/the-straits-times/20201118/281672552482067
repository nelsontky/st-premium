    <p>Fol­low­ing re­cent re­ports that SarsCoV-2 – the virus re­spon­si­ble for Covid-19 – was found on frozen beef and tripe in China, The Straits Times looks at how frozen food and food fa­cil­i­ties could be pos­si­ble modes of trans­mis­sion and the risk of con­tract­ing the virus in such a man­ner.</p>
    <p>Q Should I be wor­ried about con­tract­ing the Covid-19 virus through frozen food or food pack­ag­ing?</p>
    <p>A The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) has said it is un­likely for peo­ple to con­tract Covid-19 from food or food pack­ag­ing, and that trans­mis­sion via con­tam­i­nated food is not a ma­jor in­fec­tion route.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, the Sin­ga­pore Food Agency posted on its web­site that it is “not aware of any ev­i­dence” sug­gest­ing that the virus can be trans­mit­ted to peo­ple via food or food pack­ag­ing and equip­ment.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it added that con­tact with th­ese items is “no dif­fer­ent” from con­tact with com­mon sur­faces such as lift but­tons and door knobs, which could be eas­ily con­tam­i­nated with the virus. The risk of pos­si­ble trans­mis­sion through th­ese sur­faces re­mains low. Still, it is im­por­tant to main­tain good per­sonal hy­giene.</p>
    <p>Q Should Sin­ga­pore be screen­ing all of its frozen food im­ports?</p>
    <p>A No, as the risk of trans­mis­sion from frozen food is low.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Hsu Li Yang, pro­gramme leader of in­fec­tious dis­eases and co-di­rec­tor of global health at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, said: “At present, the cost of screen­ing all frozen goods is high rel­a­tive to the po­ten­tial ben­e­fit, and other routes of trans­mis­sion are more likely and present a higher risk.”</p>
    <p>He added that Sin­ga­pore could con­sider screen­ing all its frozen food if it is ul­ti­mately aim­ing for zero Covid-19 cases and af­ter it has ac­counted for and con­trolled all other com­mon routes of virus trans­mis­sion and im­por­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Q What are the im­pli­ca­tions of the virus per­sist­ing on the pack­ag­ing of th­ese frozen goods and should peo­ple be wary of frozen food im­ports?</p>
    <p>A Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher, se­nior con­sul­tant at the di­vi­sion of in­fec­tious dis­eases at Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal, said there is cir­cum­stan­tial ev­i­dence show­ing that food han­dlers may be­come in­fected from im­ported virus on fresh or frozen food. How­ever, by the time pack­aged food gets to con­sumers, there is al­most no chance that the virus would still be on the pack­ag­ing. Even if it were, there would have to be an ad­e­quate in­fec­tive dose for this to be a route of trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Dr Danielle An­der­son, sci­en­tific di­rec­tor of the Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School ABSL3 lab­o­ra­tory, said that there is cur­rently no de­fin­i­tive ev­i­dence of peo­ple be­ing in­fected from food pack­ag­ing. As a safety pre­cau­tion, peo­ple should en­sure they cook food thor­oughly and wash their hands well af­ter han­dling raw food, as this can also help pre­vent food-borne dis­eases.</p>
    <p>Q Can the Covid-19 virus be spread through cooked food?</p>
    <p>A There is no ev­i­dence that peo­ple can catch Covid-19 from cooked food, ac­cord­ing to the WHO. The virus caus­ing Covid-19 can be killed at tem­per­a­tures sim­i­lar to those at which other known viruses and bac­te­ria are killed. Thus, food such as eggs and all meat – in­clud­ing poul­try – should be cooked to at least 70 deg C.</p>
    <p>Q Should we be wor­ried about food pro­cess­ing and cold stor­age fa­cil­i­ties? Are they a hot spot for the virus to spread?</p>
    <p>A Given that the virus tends to sur­vive longer in colder tem­per­a­tures, the con­di­tions at th­ese fa­cil­i­ties tend to be more favourable for its trans­mis­sion and spread.</p>
    <p>Dr An­der­son feels that the fa­cil­i­ties are a con­cern as work­ers are of­ten in close prox­im­ity to one another. Masks may also be­come damp and in­ef­fec­tive at colder tem­per­a­tures. She noted that many of th­ese work­ers fear los­ing their jobs if they take days off, mak­ing them more likely to go to work even when sick.</p>
    <p>All work­places, in­clud­ing lo­cal food pro­cess­ing fa­cil­i­ties, have to ad­here to safe man­age­ment mea­sures. Em­ploy­ers who fail to do so may face stop-work or­ders or financial penal­ties.</p>
