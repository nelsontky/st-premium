    <p>When Ulu Pan­dan res­i­dent Sab­rina Lee learnt that mi­grant work­ers were be­ing re­housed to a fa­cil­ity at her es­tate, she came up with a plan to wel­come them to the neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>The 24-year-old post­grad­u­ate stu­dent got in touch with vol­un­teer-run mi­grant wel­fare group Wel­come In My Back­yard (Wimby) to put her idea into mo­tion.</p>
    <p>She sug­gested a pay-it-for­ward ini­tia­tive, Back­yard Makan, as a mean­ing­ful way to engage res­i­dents, sup­port small busi­nesses and show ap­pre­ci­a­tion to mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Lee: “One of the sites pretty close to my home was des­ig­nated as a re­hous­ing site. I was wor­ried that at­ti­tudes might arise in the neigh­bour­hood, given that there have not been mi­grant work­ers liv­ing here be­fore.</p>
    <p>“I thought it would be a nice ges­ture for neigh­bours in this es­tate to show their ap­pre­ci­a­tion through this ini­tia­tive.”</p>
    <p>Launched on Dec 1, Back­yard Makan en­cour­aged res­i­dents to pa­tro­n­ise (in-per­son or on­line) par­tic­i­pat­ing bak­eries to spon­sor baked goods and sign fes­tive cards de­signed by Wimby for the work­ers.</p>
    <p>Pro­ceeds from the goods – sold to the public at re­tail prices – went to­wards the busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>The baked goods and fes­tive notes will be dis­trib­uted in the up­com­ing fes­tive sea­son.</p>
    <p>Rop­ing in three bak­eries – The Head­less Baker, Bak­ery Br­era & Fine Foods and on­line bak­ery aw­ild­flower­bak­ery – the team also</p>
    <p>iden­ti­fied pos­si­ble sites in Queensway and Ghim Moh where the baked goods could be de­liv­ered to the work­ers.</p>
    <p>Wimby vol­un­teer Natalie Chu, 22, said get­ting enough vol­un­teers to ex­e­cute ini­tia­tives such as Back­yard Makan was a chal­lenge. “Get­ting enough peo­ple with the time to put in the ef­fort and com­mit to a long-term and com­plex pro­ject is def­i­nitely a chal­lenge,” she said.</p>
    <p>While they set an ini­tial tar­get of</p>
    <p>about 150 baked goods, Ms Lee and the Wimby team were sur­prised by the over­whelm­ing re­sponse from the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>By the close of Back­yard Makan’s cam­paign last Mon­day, over 400 baked goods had been spon­sored.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee said: “We hope the ini­tia­tive can be repli­cated in dif­fer­ent neigh­bour­hoods around Sin­ga­pore, given the pos­i­tive re­sponse we have seen in this pi­lot phase.”</p>
