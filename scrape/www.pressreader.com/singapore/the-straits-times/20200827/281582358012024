    <p>A new lead­er­ship will take over Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics af­ter its pres­i­dent Tang Weng Fei re­vealed he will not stand for re-elec­tion at the an­nual gen­eral meet­ing on Sept 25. One of those eye­ing the post is Mr Lien Choong Luen, Go­jek Sin­ga­pore gen­eral man­ager, who is lead­ing a slate of nine called “Team Ground Up”.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics (SA) pres­i­dent Tang Weng Fei will not stand for re-elec­tion at the as­so­ci­a­tion’s on­line an­nual gen­eral meet­ing on Sept 25, when the elec­tion of its lead­ers will take place.</p>
    <p>Tang, an oil trader and for­mer na­tional hur­dler, told The Straits Times yes­ter­day his de­ci­sion was not an easy one. The 66-year-old said: “As we con­tinue to nav­i­gate the un­cer­tain­ties that Covid-19 has brought, I have to now re-eval­u­ate my abil­ity to man­age all my obli­ga­tions – be it my pas­sion to­wards sports, my busi­nesses and my fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“There was no ‘tip­ping point’ in my de­ci­sion. Hav­ing as­sessed what is cur­rently on my plate, it was a tough de­ci­sion but one that is ul­ti­mately nec­es­sary for the year ahead.”</p>
    <p>The con­clu­sion of his term comes in the midst of a tur­bu­lent time for the as­so­ci­a­tion, which re­cently saw the res­ig­na­tions of its vice-pres­i­dent (fi­nance and part­ner­ship) Poh Seng Song and ath­letes’ com­mis­sion rep­re­sen­ta­tive Gary Yeo, both for­mer na­tional sprint­ers.</p>
    <p>Last De­cem­ber, af­ter a poor cam­paign at the Philip­pines SEA Games, where its ath­letes clinched three bronzes (down from two golds, two sil­vers and four bronzes in 2017 and 3-3-3 in 2015), SA was lam­basted by Sport Sin­ga­pore for in­fight­ing, be­fore it was then hit by the res­ig­na­tions of three coaches.</p>
    <p>It is also em­broiled in a law­suit with t wo-time SEA Games marathon cham­pion Soh Rui Yong over com­ments made fol­low­ing his non-se­lec­tion for the 2019 edi­tion.</p>
    <p>Tang, who was SA pres­i­dent from 2004 to 2006, and again from 2010 to 2016, said of his third stint as pres­i­dent: “(It) was dif­fer­ent from the pre­vi­ous two terms – deal­ing with in­ter­nal dis­putes, court pro­ceed­ings and poor ath­lete per­for­mance, as was seen at the 2019 SEA Games.</p>
    <p>“Man­ag­ing these i ssues were both time con­sum­ing and at times even frus­trat­ing as I truly be­lieve that an NSA (na­tional sports as­so­ci­a­tion) like SA should be fo­cus­ing on other more press­ing is­sues like ath­lete per­for­mance and en­sur­ing we are fo­cused on the well-be­ing and train­ing of our ath­letes.”</p>
    <p>Tang had pre­vi­ously told ST that man­ag­ing an NSA is “not rocket sci­ence”. But he stressed yes­ter­day that it is nec­es­sary to have a “co­he­sive sys­tem and mu­tual trust be­tween all stake­hold­ers and the man­age­ment com­mit­tee”.</p>
    <p>This was “not an easy ask” as the com­mit­tee was “al­ways hav­ing to ad­dress old is­sues and dif­fer­ing opin­ions”, he added.</p>
    <p>Tang con­sid­ers his sec­ond term the most sat­is­fy­ing, dur­ing which</p>
    <p>SA se­cured its own train­ing track at the Home of Ath­let­ics in Kal­lang and clinched three golds at the 2015 SEA Games in Sin­ga­pore, among other things. A high­light of his most re­cent term is the com­ple­tion of the as­so­ci­a­tion’s multi-year sports plan, which re­sulted in its fund­ing – which was cut in 2017 for fail­ing to pro­duce a con­vinc­ing plan – be­ing re­stored.</p>
    <p>He urged his suc­ces­sor to take the time to un­der­stand the sys­tem, its man­age­ment, and the ath­letes, adding that the com­mit­tee must have “a shared pas­sion tem­pered with a proper mind­set for the sport”.</p>
    <p>Tang, who serves on the Olympic Coun­cil of Asia’s sports com­mit­tee and Asian Ath­let­ics As­so­ci­a­tion’s fi­nance and ethics com­mis­sions, also called on the fra­ter­nity to unite.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that while SA’s goal is to have Sin­ga­pore’s track and field ath­letes ranked among the top three coun­tries in South-east Asia, “if our house is not in har­mony, ul­ti­mately our ath­letes and our sport will suf­fer”.</p>
    <p>De­spite the tur­moil within the sport, he urged the ath­letes to plough on, say­ing: “Ev­ery strong ath­lete un­der­stands that the most im­por­tant thing in ev­ery set­back is to set aside all the dis­trac­tions and to fo­cus on what re­ally mat­ters. Be it run­ning on a track, or run­ning an NSA, these prin­ci­ples will al­ways re­main the same – two steps for­ward and one step back is ul­ti­mately still one step for­ward.”</p>
