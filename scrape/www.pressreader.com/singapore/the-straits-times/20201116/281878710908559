    <p>ADDIS ABABA • Gun­men killed at least 34 peo­ple in a “grue­some” at­tack on a pas­sen­ger bus in west Ethiopia, a part of the coun­try that has re­cently seen a spate of deadly as­saults on civil­ians, the na­tional hu­man rights body said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Ethiopian Hu­man Rights Com­mis­sion (EHRC) said in a state­ment that “the es­ti­mated num­ber of ca­su­al­ties, cur­rently at 34, is likely to rise” from the at­tack last Satur­day night in the Ben­is­hangul-Gu­muz re­gion.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the com­mis­sion con­firmed that the ca­su­al­ties were all deaths.</p>
    <p>The state­ment said the bus at­tack oc­curred in the De­bate ad­min­is­tra­tive area, and that “there are re­ports of sim­i­lar at­tacks” in three other ar­eas, as well as “of per­sons who have fled to seek shel­ter”.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Abiy Ahmed’s gov­ern­ment has pro­vided scant in­for­ma­tion on re­cent vi­o­lence in Ben­is­hangul-Gu­muz, par­tic­u­larly in the Metekel zone where De­bate is lo­cated. Twelve peo­ple were killed in an at­tack in the zone last month, while 15 died in a sim­i­lar at­tack in late Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Mr Abiy told law­mak­ers last month that fight­ers re­spon­si­ble for the killings were re­ceiv­ing train­ing and shel­ter in neigh­bour­ing Su­dan and Khar­toum’s as­sis­tance was needed to sta­bilise the area.</p>
    <p>There is no known link be­tween the vi­o­lence in Ben­is­hangul-Gu­muz and mil­i­tary op­er­a­tions in Ethiopia’s north­ern Tigray re­gion, which have killed hun­dreds and sent nearly 25,000 peo­ple flee­ing over the bor­der into Su­dan.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion politi­cians have de­scribed the vi­o­lence in Ben­is­hangul-Gu­muz as eth­ni­cally mo­ti­vated. Specif­i­cally they say there is a tar­geted cam­paign by eth­nic Gu­muz mili­tias against eth­nic Amhara and Agew in Metekel.</p>
    <p>“The un­re­lent­ing pace of at­tacks on civil­ians in Ben­is­hangul-Gu­muz calls for higher vig­i­lance and a more co­or­di­nated ac­tion be­tween re­gional and fed­eral se­cu­rity forces,” EHRC chief com­mis­sioner Daniel Bekele said yes­ter­day.</p>
