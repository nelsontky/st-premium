    <p>A 38-year-old Malaysian es­caped the noose when he was ac­quit­ted in the Court of Ap­peal yesterday of a charge of be­ing a drug courier.</p>
    <p>Beh Chew Boo was ar­rested in 2016 for al­legedly at­tempt­ing to carry 499.97g of metham­phetamine across the cause­way.</p>
    <p>He was sentenced to death in Jan­uary this year by the High Court.</p>
    <p>De­spite the ac­quit­tal, he will con­tinue to be in re­mand while the court de­cides on how it will pro­ceed on four other charges con­nected to his case which have been tem­po­rar­ily stood down.</p>
    <p>The higher court – which was presided over by Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon and Judges of Ap­peal</p>
    <p>Tay Yong Kwang and Steven Chong – found, among other things, that there were in­suf­fi­cient grounds to prove Beh was com­pletely aware that he was fer­ry­ing drugs.</p>
    <p>This was be­cause his fin­ger­prints and DNA were not on the parcels, and the mo­tor­cy­cle he was rid­ing – on which the drugs were found – was bor­rowed from a friend and did not be­long to him.</p>
    <p>Beh was ar­rested on Oct 26, 2016, when he en­tered Sin­ga­pore from Malaysia at the Wood­lands Check­point at around 5.20am.</p>
    <p>He was rid­ing a Malaysian-reg­is­tered mo­tor­cy­cle owned by his friend and for­mer col­league Lew Shyang Huei. Beh’s girl­friend Ting Swee Ling was rid­ing pil­lion.</p>
    <p>Po­lice Con­sta­ble Israel Ra­jan, who stopped Beh and Ting for a rou­tine check, found sev­eral bun­dles of a crys­talline sub­stance – later re­vealed to be metham­phetamine – in the mo­tor­cy­cle’s stor­age com­part­ment, and ar­rested the duo.</p>
    <p>When ques­tioned, Beh said he did not know the drugs were in the mo­tor­cy­cle. He also claimed that he had bor­rowed the mo­tor­cy­cle from Lew many times to en­ter Sin­ga­pore, as toll fees were cheaper than if he were to drive a car.</p>
    <p>Beh de­nied that the drugs found in the mo­tor­cy­cle’s stor­age com­part­ment were his. He also claimed that he had never seen them be­fore his ar­rest and did not know the con­tents of the pack­ages un­til they were un­wrapped.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Tay noted that Beh, at the time of his trial, could not re­but the pre­sump­tions of pos­ses­sion and knowl­edge, which re­sulted in his con­vic­tion.</p>
    <p>But there were other fac­tors that jus­ti­fied an ac­quit­tal, said Jus­tice Tay. For one thing, Beh’s DNA was not found on any of the drug bun­dles, but Lew’s fin­ger­prints and</p>
    <p>DNA were found on the in­te­rior and ex­te­rior of the bun­dles.</p>
    <p>Lew had been ar­rested for un­re­lated drug charges, and was sentenced in July 2018 to a seven-year jail term. He was in prison while Beh stood trial from July last year, but was not called to tes­tify.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Tay added that the pros­e­cu­tion, in de­cid­ing not to call Lew to the stand, de­spite his be­ing “read­ily avail­able to tes­tify”, was not able to fully dis­prove Beh’s defence that he knew noth­ing about the drugs.</p>
    <p>“In the unique cir­cum­stances here, we are of the view that Beh’s ac­count was not in­her­ently in­cred­i­ble,” Jus­tice Tay added.</p>
