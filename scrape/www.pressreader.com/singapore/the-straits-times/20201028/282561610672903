    <p>HONG KONG • Is a re­turn to show busi­ness on the cards for Hong Kong ac­tress Jac­que­line Wong?</p>
    <p>The tele­vi­sion se­ri­als that she had acted in were quickly canned af­ter she was caught in a cheat­ing scan­dal with mar­ried Hong Kong singer Andy Hui in April last year.</p>
    <p>But it seems like the worst is over for Wong, 31, with one of those shows fi­nally sched­uled to be broad­cast in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>The Of­fliners, which is cen­tred on an heiress (Katy Kung) who starts a tech com­pany, was shown in Malaysia last Novem­ber, but has not been re­leased in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, it was among the tele­vi­sion se­ri­als that broad­caster TVB un­veiled for next year. Wong, who plays a sup­port­ing role in the serial, was even seen twice in the trailer for the show.</p>
    <p>This comes af­ter two other drama se­ri­als that Wong had acted in were be­lat­edly re­leased late last year. Find­ing Her Voice was taken out of cold stor­age last Oc­to­ber, while Hand­maid­ens United was re­leased last De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>Another serial, Foren­sic He­roes 4, was reshot to re­move scenes that fea­tured Wong. Her role was taken over in­stead by ac­tress Rox­anne Tong, who is the girl­friend of her for­mer boyfriend, ac­tor Ken­neth Ma. The tele­vi­sion serial aired in Fe­bru­ary this year.</p>
    <p>Asked for a com­ment by the me­dia in Hong Kong, Wong said in a text mes­sage: “I am happy for the team. No other re­sponse. Thank you.”</p>
    <p>She did not re­ply when asked when she would be re­turn­ing to the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try. She has not up­dated her In­sta­gram ac­count since July 22.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, her for­mer boyfriend Ma seems to be the new dar­ling of TVB.</p>
    <p>He will be star­ring i n four tele­vi­sion se­ri­als next year, in­clud­ing Big White Duel 2, the se­quel to the pop­u­lar med­i­cal drama Big White Duel, as well as Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>The 46-year-old ac­tor was crowned Best Ac­tor for the first time at the TVB An­niver­sary Awards 2019 i n Jan­uary, af­ter hav­ing been nom­i­nated 12 times at the awards.</p>
