    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tish health ex­perts have ad­mit­ted that the coro­n­avirus cri­sis is out of con­trol as case num­bers and hospi­tal ad­mis­sions rise de­spite a slew of new re­stric­tions on so­cial gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>“Things are def­i­nitely head­ing in the wrong di­rec­tion,” Bri­tain’s chief sci­en­tific ad­viser Pa­trick Val­lance said on Wed­nes­day, as 7,108 news cases and 71 deaths were re­ported.</p>
    <p>As Eng­land’s chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer Chris Whitty warned that hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions and ad­mis­sions to in­ten­sive care were also ris­ing, Sir Val­lance added: “We don’t have this un­der con­trol at the mo­ment.”</p>
    <p>More than 42,000 peo­ple have died from Covid-19 in Bri­tain, the worst toll in Europe, de­spite a na­tion­wide stay-at-home or­der im­posed in late March. The lock­down was eased in June but the au­thor­i­ties have in re­cent weeks reim­posed re­stric­tions on so­cial gath­er­ings, in­clud­ing a ban on groups of more than six and early clos­ing for pubs.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son said it was “still too early to tell” if these would have an ef­fect and urged peo­ple to fol­low the rules.</p>
    <p>“If we put in the work to­gether now, then we give our­selves the best pos­si­ble chance of avoid­ing that out­come and avoid­ing fur­ther mea­sures,” he said.</p>
    <p>De­spite the warn­ings about ris­ing case num­bers, many of Mr John­son’s Con­ser­va­tive law­mak­ers are in­creas­ingly an­gry at the lim­its im­posed on per­sonal free­dom.</p>
    <p>More than 50 MPs had ear­lier threat­ened to sup­port a mo­tion in Par­lia­ment de­mand­ing more scru­tiny of fu­ture reg­u­la­tions, ac­cus­ing min­is­ters of gov­ern­ing “by de­cree”.</p>
    <p>House of Com­mons Speaker Lind­say Hoyle re­fused to put the amend­ment to a vote for pro­ce­dural rea­sons, spar­ing Mr John­son a re­bel­lion. But then he him­self launched a scathing at­tack on Mr John­son’s “con­tempt” for Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Sir Hoyle has re­peat­edly ad­mon­ished min­is­ters for an­nounc­ing virus re­stric­tions to the me­dia be­fore Par­lia­ment and for not al­low­ing time for de­bate be­fore they come into force.</p>
    <p>Health Sec­re­tary Matt Han­cock later of­fered to con­sult Par­lia­ment and “wher­ever pos­si­ble” hold votes be­fore any new na­tional coro­n­avirus mea­sures came into ef­fect.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, he in­tro­duced more re­stric­tions across a wider area of Eng­land, in­clud­ing the north­ern city of Liver­pool.</p>
    <p>“I am to­day ex­tend­ing these mea­sures that have been in place in the north-east since the start of this week to the Liver­pool city re­gion, War­ring­ton, Hartle­pool and Mid­dles­brough,” he told Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>He said he un­der­stood concerns about pubs and restau­rants, many of which have been hurt by the introducti­on of a 10pm cur­few in Eng­land, Scot­land and Wales.</p>
    <p>“We will do what­ever we can to sup­port them while act­ing fast to keep this virus un­der con­trol,” he said. “I know that these mea­sures are hard, and that they are yet another sac­ri­fice.”</p>
