    <p>The strong de­sire among Sin­ga­pore­ans for more op­po­si­tion voices in Par­lia­ment means the PAP is un­likely to ex­ceed a 65 per cent share of the pop­u­lar vote in fu­ture elec­tions, Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>But while this “ma­jor trend” means sub­se­quent gen­eral elec­tions will only get tougher for the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party, it will aim for “at least the up­per end of the 60 to 65 per cent range” of votes, he said.</p>
    <p>The re­cently con­cluded elec­tion has shown that vot­ers’ de­sire for po­lit­i­cal op­po­si­tion is strong, and that de­sire for checks and bal­ances to a PAP Gov­ern­ment is “per­ma­nent”, Mr Wong told ac­tivists in a livestream­ed speech from the party head­quar­ters in Be­dok.</p>
    <p>“Even those who pre­fer the PAP as gov­ern­ment would vote tac­ti­cally for the op­po­si­tion where it is cred­i­ble,” he said of the party’s pre­lim­i­nary as­sess­ment of the re­sults of the July 10 gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>On the elected op­po­si­tion, he said: “It is here to stay, and we must be pre­pared for this new re­al­ity: For now, Sin­ga­pore­ans want to see the PAP in power, but they also want a cred­i­ble op­po­si­tion to check on the PAP.”</p>
    <p>A rea­son­able ex­pec­ta­tion for the PAP in the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion would have been around 64 to 65 per cent of the vote share, or some­where be­tween the out­comes of the gen­eral elec­tions in 2011 and 2015.</p>
    <p>The PAP got its low­est vote share since in­de­pen­dence, 60.1 per cent, in the 2011 Gen­eral Elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said it would be dif­fi­cult for the PAP to achieve the 69.9 per cent vote share it got in the 2015 Gen­eral Elec­tion or the 75.3 per cent it man­aged in the 2001 Gen­eral Elec­tion, two elec­tions that were “out­liers” to the his­tor­i­cal trend.</p>
    <p>The 2015 Gen­eral Elec­tion was Sin­ga­pore’s SG50 mile­stone and the year found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew died, while the 2001 Gen­eral Elec­tion was called soon af­ter the Sept 11 ter­ror­ist at­tacks in the United States and amid a re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing seven of the nine elec­tions since and in­clud­ing the one in 1984 saw the PAP get be­tween 60 per cent and 66.6 per cent of the votes, with about 63 per cent or less in four.</p>
    <p>This means the PAP’s vote share of 61.2 per cent this year was “not a very good re­sult but it is within the range of ex­pec­ta­tions, and we’ve been here be­fore”, said Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>The over­all re­sults made it clear that vot­ers want the PAP in charge, and the op­po­si­tion ex­plic­itly re­as­sured vot­ers they were not aim­ing to re­place the PAP. “We were up against a ma­jor trend that has been there for many years, and that is a de­sire to have more op­po­si­tion in Par­lia­ment to check the PAP, to have more diver­sity of views and de­bate on pol­icy al­ter­na­tives,” he said.</p>
    <p>The PAP will work to win back the four per cent – or roughly 100,000 vot­ers – who swung away from it this elec­tion, said Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>He told ac­tivists the PAP had to ar­gue for what it be­lieves in, and keep on win­ning the trust and sup­port from a new gen­er­a­tion of vot­ers.</p>
    <p>“Re­mem­ber, the right to lead­er­ship can­not be in­her­ited. Just be­cause the PAP has gov­erned Sin­ga­pore since in­de­pen­dence doesn’t mean that it al­ways will gov­ern Sin­ga­pore through­out,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We must con­tinue to strive to win the trust of our peo­ple and we must prove that we can gov­ern well. Then we can de­velop a sta­ble po­lit­i­cal bal­ance and the PAP can con­tinue win­ning fu­ture elec­tions.”</p>
    <p>“Now that we have put the elec­tion be­hind us and elected a strong team to rep­re­sent Sin­ga­pore­ans, let us stay fo­cused on do­ing our best for Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore­ans,” added Mr Wong. “We have five years to over­come the prob­lems, con­sol­i­date on the ground and show vot­ers what we can do.”</p>
