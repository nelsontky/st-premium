    <p>As the eco­nomic and so­cial fall­out from the Covid-19 pan­demic con­tin­ues to bite, the 21 tem­po­rary shel­ters for the home­less in Sin­ga­pore are mostly full and there are about 100 peo­ple on the wait list.</p>
    <p>These Safe Sound Sleep­ing Places (S3Ps) are run by com­mu­nity and re­li­gious groups, which vol­un­tar­ily open up their premises to pro­vide short-term refuge to those in need of shel­ter.</p>
    <p>There are two main rea­sons for the cur­rent short­age of shel­ter space: in­creased de­mand and re­duced num­ber of S3Ps.</p>
    <p>With the coro­n­avirus out­break, es­pe­cially dur­ing the cir­cuit­breaker pe­riod when non-es­sen­tial ser­vices were shut, more of those who have been sleep­ing on the streets are ask­ing to go into a shel­ter.</p>
    <p>The places where these rough sleep­ers spend their nights, such as void decks and their work­places, be­came off-lim­its to them un­der cir­cuit-breaker mea­sures, said those who work with the home­less.</p>
    <p>A Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment (MSF) spokesman said: “The eco­nomic down­turn has also con­trib­uted to the num­ber of home­less in­di­vid­u­als, who may face the loss of jobs and may no longer be able to af­ford open mar­ket rental rates, as well as ten­sions be­tween fam­i­lies or co-ten­ants.”</p>
    <p>Oth­ers are home­less as they can no longer make the daily com­mute be­tween Sin­ga­pore, where they work, and their homes in Jo­hor Baru or Batam due to travel re­stric­tions, said a spokesman for the Home­less Hearts of Sin­ga­pore, a char­ity group.</p>
    <p>Many turned to the S3Ps for help.</p>
    <p>“S3Ps are tem­po­rary in­terim ac­com­mo­da­tion run by com­mu­nity part­ners who have availed their premises, mostly in re­li­gious premises, to pro­vide overnight stay for rough sleep­ers out of good­will,” said the MSF spokesman.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the cir­cuit breaker started in April, there were just seven S3Ps.</p>
    <p>The num­ber grew to over 40 dur­ing the two-month cir­cuit breaker, but about 20 of them have since closed as they have re­sumed their pri­mary op­er­a­tions, among other rea­sons, said the MSF spokesman.</p>
    <p>There are now 21 S3Ps which can ac­com­mo­date about 560 in­di­vid­u­als. And most of these spa­ces are cur­rently taken up, said the MSF spokesman.</p>
    <p>As at the mid­dle of last month, there were about 100 peo­ple on the wait list.</p>
    <p>The MSF spokesman ex­plained that the re­main­ing va­can­cies in the S3Ps are for peo­ple pend­ing ad­mis­sion, among other things.</p>
    <p>Since April, more than 800 rough sleep­ers and home­less peo­ple have been sup­ported by the Part­ners En­gag­ing and Em­pow­er­ing Rough Sleep­ers (Peers) net­work, so­cial ser­vice agen­cies, other com­mu­nity part­ners and the MSF.</p>
    <p>The Peers net­work is made up of groups com­pris­ing gov­ern­ment agen­cies, re­li­gious groups and char­i­ties work­ing to­gether to help the home­less.</p>
    <p>The spokesman added: “The MSF con­tin­ues to work closely with our com­mu­nity part­ners to in­crease the num­ber of shel­ter spa­ces.”</p>
    <p>Hope Cen­tre, the so­cial arm of Hope Church Sin­ga­pore, started op­er­at­ing as an S3P dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker by of­fer­ing shel­ter at its two drop-in cen­tres.</p>
    <p>A HOPE CEN­TRE SPOKESMAN.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre, the so­cial arm of Hope Church Sin­ga­pore, started op­er­at­ing as a Safe Sound Sleep­ing Place dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker by of­fer­ing shel­ter in its two drop-in cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Its spokesman said: “When the cir­cuit breaker kicked in, we re­alised that the home­less peo­ple would not even have a place to sit and rest (in pub­lic spa­ces)... so we stepped up to meet the need.”</p>
    <p>It had 16 male rough sleep­ers at its King Ge­orge Av­enue cen­tre and 18 fe­male rough sleep­ers at its Craw­ford Lane cen­tre.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it stopped op­er­at­ing as an S3P at the end of Au­gust as it had to re­sume its pro­grammes for chil­dren and se­niors af­ter the cir­cuit breaker ended in June, among other rea­sons.</p>
    <p>The Kas­sim Mosque and the Assyakirin Mosque re­sponded to the call to shel­ter rough sleep­ers dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, a spokesman for the Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore (Muis) said.</p>
    <p>From April 20 to May 28, Kas­sim Mosque pro­vided shel­ter to 10 peo­ple, while the Assyakirin Mosque served seven peo­ple from April 23 to May 27.</p>
    <p>The Muis spokesman said: “Dur­ing their stay, the res­i­dents were pro­vided with daily food vouch­ers, ac­cess to com­pli­men­tary Wi-Fi and pro­vided with ba­sic wash­ing and laundry fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“At the end of the cir­cuit-breaker pe­riod, the res­i­dents were given trans­port and fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance.”</p>
    <p>Groups that are still op­er­at­ing as S3Ps in­clude SowCare, which started wel­com­ing the home­less in April, and Yio Chu Kang Chapel, which did so in Novem­ber last year be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>SowCare, the char­ity arm of the Bi­ble So­ci­ety, con­verted the shel­tered carpark at the Bi­ble So­ci­ety’s premises in Ar­me­nian Street for the home­less to sleep in at night.</p>
    <p>Yio Chu Kang Chapel did like­wise and its shel­tered carpark can now house a max­i­mum of 15 peo­ple at night. The home­less sleep on por­ta­ble beds and have ac­cess to Wi-Fi, tele­vi­sion, wash­ing ma­chines and toi­lets.</p>
    <p>They come in the evenings and leave by 7.30am the next morn­ing, said lead pas­tor Rick Toh.</p>
    <p>“Ours is a long-term project. We are go­ing to keep do­ing this un­til the need no longer ex­ists,” he added.</p>
    <p>A 70-year-old di­vorce, who wanted to be known only as Mr Tan, lived in an S3P be­tween May and Au­gust.</p>
    <p>The for­mer petrol sta­tion at­ten­dant used to pay $25 for a bed in a hos­tel, but he could no longer af­ford the rent as it took half of his $1,500 salary.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 out­break was another rea­son why he wanted to move out of the hos­tel, where the room was shared by eight peo­ple, as he was afraid of catch­ing the virus.</p>
    <p>He sought the help of a so­cial ser­vice of­fice, which ad­min­is­ters gov­ern­ment fi­nan­cial aid schemes, to ap­ply for a highly sub­sidised Hous­ing Board rental flat.</p>
    <p>The so­cial ser­vice of­fice ar­ranged for him to stay at an S3P un­til he has more per­ma­nent ac­com­mo­da­tion.</p>
    <p>He said: “The S3P was okay; they helped me a lot. I’m old al­ready, where else can I go?”</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber, he moved into a one­room rental flat.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan, who is now work­ing as a se­cu­rity guard earn­ing $1,800 a month, said: “I am grate­ful for the help I got in fi­nally get­ting an HDB flat to live in, and I get along with my room­mate.”</p>
    <p>MEET­ING A NEED</p>
    <p>When the cir­cuit breaker kicked in, we re­alised that the home­less peo­ple would not even have a place to sit and rest (in pub­lic spa­ces)... so we stepped up to meet the need.</p>
