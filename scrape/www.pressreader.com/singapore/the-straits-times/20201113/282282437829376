    <p>• The in­au­gu­ral Au­tumn Na­tions Cup starts with Ire­land fac­ing Wales in Dublin to­day as rugby union con­tin­ues to deal with the fall­out from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>An eight-team event will fea­ture Europe’s lead­ing six na­tions as well as Fiji and Geor­gia, who came in af­ter Ja­pan with­drew be­cause of travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Teams will be split into two groups of four, with Eng­land, Wales, Ire­land and Geor­gia form­ing one pool and Scot­land, France, Italy and Fiji the other. They will each play three group matches be­fore the tour­na­ment ends on the week­end of Dec 5-6 with a fi­nal be­tween the pool win­ners, while the other na­tions face a team in the same po­si­tion in the other group to de­ter­mine the mi­nor plac­ings.</p>
    <p>THE ‘COVID’ CUP</p>
    <p>This Cup is a prod­uct of Covid-19. It re­places the end-of-year schedule that usu­ally sees south­ern hemi­sphere giants New Zealand, South Africa and Aus­tralia, none of whom are ven­tur­ing across the Equa­tor this time on health grounds, tour Europe.</p>
    <p>Al­though Au­tumn Na­tions Cup matches are set to be played be­hind closed doors be­cause of the virus, they will gen­er­ate much­needed broad­cast in­come.</p>
    <p>Eng­land’s Rugby Foot­ball Union, one of the game’s wealth­i­est gov­ern­ing bod­ies, re­cently an­nounced an an­nual loss of £10.8 mil­lion (S$19.2 mil­lion), with of­fi­cials braced for more fi­nan­cial bad news in the next year as a re­sult of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Six Na­tions cham­pi­ons Eng­land and a re­vived France will be favourites to reach the fi­nal.</p>
    <p>But French chances may be ham­pered by a deal struck in re­sponse to an ex­panded fix­ture list be­tween the coun­try’s lead­ing clubs and the French Rugby Fed­er­a­tion which means Les Bleus’ play­ers can fea­ture in only one Na­tions Cup match if they played against Wales and Ire­land last month.</p>
    <p>IN­NO­VATE V CON­SOL­I­DATE</p>
    <p>In the build-up to the 2023 World Cup in France, teams may try to develop their squad depth.</p>
    <p>Eng­land coach Ed­die Jones has spo­ken about play­ing nine for­wards in his side’s opener against Geor­gia at Twick­en­ham to­mor­row, rather than the usual eight, in a bid to counter the phys­i­cal Le­los’ pack.</p>
    <p>“When Barcelona beat Man United in the Cham­pi­ons League in 2009, they played the false nine,” he said. “There’s no rea­son why you can’t do that in rugby and play a false 10 or a false winger.”</p>
    <p>Such ex­per­i­men­ta­tion is a lux­ury that Wales, on a run of five suc­ces­sive de­feats un­der coach Wayne Pi­vac, may not be able to af­ford away to Ire­land.</p>
    <p>Mon­day saw Wales dis­pense with the ser­vices of de­fence coach By­ron Hay­ward, who like Pi­vac joined af­ter former boss War­ren Gat­land stood down fol­low­ing last year’s World Cup.</p>
    <p>OP­POR­TU­NITY FOR FIJI, GEOR­GIA</p>
    <p>A com­plaint of teams such as Fiji and Geor­gia is that, be­cause they are not in­volved in a ma­jor an­nual tour­na­ment, they are de­prived of matches against lead­ing na­tions in be­tween World Cups.</p>
    <p>At 11th and 12th re­spec­tively in the world rank­ings, they are bet­ter placed than peren­nial Six Na­tions strug­glers Italy (14th), which makes the Az­zurri’s match against Fiji on Nov 21 a much-an­tic­i­pated clash.</p>
    <p>Per­for­mances, rather than re­sults, may be the best way to gauge Fiji and Geor­gia’s ef­forts, with the Ge­or­gians ham­mered 48-7 by Scot­land last month.</p>
    <p>“When we fin­ish this tour­na­ment, if we know we are a bet­ter team than be­fore the start then we have had a suc­cess­ful Au­tumn Na­tions Cup,” said Geor­gia cap­tain Merab Sharikadze.</p>
