    <p>Cap­i­taLand has posted an 89 per cent drop in net profit to $96.6 mil­lion for the first half ended June 30, from $875.4 mil­lion a year ago.</p>
    <p>This was due mainly to the im­pact of Covid-19 mea­sures on its res­i­den­tial, re­tail and lodg­ing busi­nesses, the real es­tate gi­ant an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Cap­i­taLand’s res­i­den­tial sales of­fices were forced to close, its nonessen­tial re­tail trades were un­able to operate, and the oc­cu­pancy of its lodg­ing as­sets fell be­cause of travel re­stric­tions, it said.</p>
    <p>Ten­ant sup­port mea­sures in var­i­ous mar­kets, in­clud­ing gov­ern­ment-man­dated land­lord obli­ga­tions and the group’s own ini­tia­tives, were also a fac­tor.</p>
    <p>Earn­ings per share stood at 1.9 cents for the half year, down from 21 cents a year ago.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue for the first half fell 4.9 per cent to $2.03 bil­lion, from $2.13 bil­lion a year ago. This was due mainly to about $158.6 mil­lion in rent re­bates granted by land­lords to ten­ants in Sin­ga­pore, China and Malaysia, as well as lower con­tri­bu­tions from the group’s malls, res­i­den­tial projects and lodg­ing busi­nesses amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The fall was par­tially mit­i­gated by con­sol­i­da­tion of the Raf­fles City Chongqing project, and con­tri­bu­tions from the As­cen­das and Sing­bridge port­fo­lio that Cap­i­taLand ac­quired in June last year – which con­tributed $341.5 mil­lion to group rev­enue.</p>
    <p>No div­i­dend was de­clared for the half year, un­changed from a year ago. Cap­i­taLand pays only first and fi­nal div­i­dends.</p>
    <p>Cap­i­taLand group chief ex­ec­u­tive Lee Chee Koon said the com­pany’s bal­ance sheet re­mains in a strong po­si­tion and its long-term growth strat­egy is in­tact.</p>
    <p>“We are on an ac­tive look­out for counter-cycli­cal op­por­tu­ni­ties that will strate­gi­cally up­lift Cap­i­taLand’s growth tra­jec­tory,” he said.</p>
    <p>As­set re­cy­cling re­mains a key driver for the com­pany’s re­turn on eq­uity, and it will look to op­por­tunis­ti­cally di­vest non-core as­sets and busi­nesses, Mr Lee added.</p>
    <p>Cap­i­taLand shares closed down two cents or 0.7 per cent at $2.74 yes­ter­day.</p>
