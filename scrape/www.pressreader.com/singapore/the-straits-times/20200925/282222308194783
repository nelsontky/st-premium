    <p>Ac­ci­dents like top­pled con­tain­ers and col­li­sions are all too fa­mil­iar to lo­gis­tics play­ers when op­er­a­tions run 24/7, so it is no sur­prise that many firms are as­sess­ing high-tech op­tions to im­prove on-site safety.</p>
    <p>Al­lied Con­tainer Ser­vices is one lo­cal com­pany that is em­ploy­ing dig­i­tal solutions in this area.</p>
    <p>It has in­stalled a fleet safety man­age­ment sys­tem that can de­tect early signs of driver fa­tigue and pre­vent po­ten­tial ac­ci­dents.</p>
    <p>The sys­tem uses fa­cial recog­ni­tion tech­nol­ogy to de­tect signs of fa­tigue, such as yawn­ing, and then alerts an op­er­a­tions team, which will check on the driver.</p>
    <p>Man­ag­ing direc­tor Lim Kian Chin said: “If the driver has mul­ti­ple of­fences, such as us­ing his phone while driv­ing, the ven­dor will alert the com­pany.”</p>
    <p>The search for this safety solution started in 2018 af­ter con­cerns were raised by some of the con­tainer trans­port ser­vices firm’s clients, which in­clude petro­chem­i­cal com­pa­nies on Jurong Is­land.</p>
    <p>The sys­tem, which has been im­ple­mented in six ve­hi­cles so far, costs $4,000 for each set. The com­pany is rolling the sys­tem out to the rest of its fleet of more than 60 ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>“We’re still work­ing with the ven­dor to re­fine the sys­tem fur­ther, and au­to­mate it as much as pos­si­ble so that (checks with the driver) can be done our­selves,” Mr Lim added.</p>
    <p>Be­sides safety con­cerns, lo­gis­tics play­ers have also been us­ing dig­i­tal tools to im­prove op­er­a­tional pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG) trans­port and lo­gis­tics direc­tor Lee Meil­ian noted the im­por­tance of tech­nol­ogy in im­prov­ing Sin­ga­pore’s con­nec­tiv­ity in trade and trans­port.</p>
    <p>“Im­proved vis­i­bil­ity of op­er­a­tions and cus­tomers’ sup­ply chains en­able lo­gis­tics com­pa­nies to plan for ship­ments into and out of Sin­ga­pore, and pre­pare for the nec­es­sary trans­port and stor­age of goods in ware­houses,” she said. “The over­all ef­fi­ciency that tech­nol­ogy brings to as­set and man­power man­age­ment can help com­pa­nies op­ti­mise re­sources and stream­line op­er­a­tions.”</p>
    <p>ESG has been part­ner­ing in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing, such as the Cen­tre of In­no­va­tion for Sup­ply Chain Man­age­ment (COI-SCM) at Repub­lic Polytech­nic, to drive the adop­tion of In­dus­try 4.0 solutions and other dig­i­tal ap­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>COI-SCM, which has trained staff from more than 100 com­pa­nies through its ca­pa­bil­ity build­ing pro­grammes since 2018, is a part­ner of the re­cently re­freshed lo­gis­tics In­dus­try Dig­i­tal Plan.</p>
    <p>Around 86,300 work­ers and 5,300 small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) in the in­dus­try are ex­pected to ben­e­fit from the en­hanced plan.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal SME Ever Rich has also adopted dig­i­tal solutions to im­prove its op­er­a­tions. It im­ple­mented an en­ter­prise re­source plan­ning sys­tem last year that in­te­grated its sales and pur­chas­ing, ac­count­ing, in­ven­tory and ware­house man­age­ment sys­tems in one plat­form.</p>
    <p>The firm, which pro­vides stor­age and ware­hous­ing for food whole­sale and re­tail busi­nesses, started look­ing for such a sys­tem in 2017.</p>
    <p>This fol­lowed a change in the firm’s busi­ness model – from a lower quan­tity of large-ticket or­ders to a higher quan­tity of small-ticket ones.</p>
    <p>This meant in­creas­ing its use of dig­i­tal tools, said busi­ness devel­op­ment man­ager Alvin Tan.</p>
    <p>While he was un­able to dis­close the amount the firm in­vested due to com­mer­cial sen­si­tiv­i­ties, Mr Tan noted that the boost the sys­tem has pro­vided is a “very good re­turn”.</p>
    <p>Ever Rich’s oper­a­tion costs have fallen by 15 per cent and ca­pac­ity has in­creased by 20 per cent, he said.</p>
    <p>“Pre­vi­ously, with sep­a­rate sys­tems (for dif­fer­ent func­tions), a lot of cross-check­ing had to be done and took up a lot of time,” he added.</p>
    <p>But with real-time in­for­ma­tion now con­sol­i­dated on a sin­gle plat­form, pro­cesses are more ef­fi­cient and al­low staff to ded­i­cate more time to lo­gis­tics plan­ning rather than repet­i­tive, man­ual func­tions.</p>
    <p>Sharikat Lo­gis­tics, also a home­grown player, has in­vested around $75,000 in ar­eas such as ware­house man­age­ment and RFID (ra­dio-fre­quency iden­ti­fi­ca­tion) scan­ning equip­ment. This means it now takes just one-third the time to process or­ders, said lo­gis­tics man­ager Phang Yuan Long.</p>
    <p>It took about one to two months of on-the-job train­ing to get em­ploy­ees up to speed with the new dig­i­tal tools, he added. The ef­fec­tive­ness of the RFID scan­ning tech­nol­ogy at its am­bi­ent-tem­per­a­ture stor­age ware­house at one of its fa­cil­i­ties in Chin Bee Av­enue has prompted the firm to look into dig­i­tal­is­ing its other fa­cil­i­ties, Mr Phang said.</p>
