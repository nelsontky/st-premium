    <p>United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and his fel­low Repub­li­cans opened their na­tional con­ven­tion by paint­ing a dire por­trait of Amer­ica if Demo­crat Joe Bi­den wins, ar­gu­ing he will usher in an era of rad­i­cal so­cial­ism and chaos. Like its Demo­cratic coun­ter­part, the Repub­li­can con­ven­tion was largely vir­tual.</p>
    <p>CHARLOTTE (North Carolina) • Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and his fel­low Repub­li­cans opened their na­tional con­ven­tion by paint­ing a dire por­trait of Amer­ica if Demo­crat Joe Bi­den wins the White House in Novem­ber, ar­gu­ing he will usher in an era of rad­i­cal so­cial­ism and chaos.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump set the tone early in the day when he ad­dressed del­e­gates in Charlotte af­ter for­mally se­cur­ing their nom­i­na­tion for an­other term and claimed with­out ev­i­dence that Democrats were try­ing to steal the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­cans had vowed to of­fer an in­spir­ing, pos­i­tive mes­sage in con­trast to what they char­ac­terised as a dark and gloomy Demo­cratic con­ven­tion last week. But the first night’s prime-time pro­gramme fea­tured speak­ers who pep­pered their re­marks with omi­nous pre­dic­tions if Democrats win power.</p>
    <p>“They want to de­stroy this coun­try and ev­ery­thing that we have fought for and hold dear,” Trump cam­paign ad­viser Kim­berly Guil­foyle said.</p>
    <p>“They want to steal your lib­erty, your free­dom. They want to con­trol what you see, and think, and be­lieve, so they can con­trol how you live.”</p>
    <p>The four-day con­ven­tion opened at a crit­i­cal junc­ture for Mr Trump, 74, who trails Mr Bi­den, 77, in opinion polls, dur­ing a pan­demic that has killed more than 177,000 Amer­i­cans and erased mil­lions of jobs.</p>
    <p>Democrats drew their own dis­mal pic­ture of what four more years un­der Mr Trump would look like at their con­ven­tion last week.</p>
    <p>Like its Demo­cratic coun­ter­part, the Repub­li­can con­ven­tion was largely vir­tual. Most speak­ers ad­dressed a quiet au­di­to­rium in Wash­ing­ton DC, bow­ing to the re­al­ity of the pan­demic de­spite Mr Trump hav­ing pushed for a big event in front of thou­sands of rau­cous ad­mir­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has fo­cused on a “law and or­der” re­sponse to wide­spread protests fol­low­ing the po­lice killing of Mr Ge­orge Floyd, a black man in Min­neapo­lis, and he has pushed schools and busi­nesses to re­open de­spite the pan­demic. Both mes­sages rep­re­sent the cam­paign’s ef­fort to win back sub­ur­ban vot­ers, es­pe­cially women, who have aban­doned the Repub­li­can Party in droves dur­ing the Trump era.</p>
    <p>Mr Don­ald Trump Jr, the Pres­i­dent’s old­est son and Ms Guil­foyle’s boyfriend, por­trayed the on­go­ing civil un­rest as vi­o­lent as­saults on small busi­nesses by an­ar­chists and said Democrats would fail to keep neigh­bour­hoods safe.</p>
    <p>The dystopian lan­guage echoed that of Mr Trump’s 2017 in­au­gu­ral speech, when he vowed to end the “Amer­i­can car­nage” of crime, poverty and man­u­fac­tur­ing de­cline.</p>
    <p>It re­mains to be seen whether vot­ers find the same ar­gu­ment as com­pelling af­ter Mr Trump has held power for more than three years.</p>
    <p>Ms Kate Bed­ing­field, deputy cam</p>
    <p>BE­WARE DEMOCRATS DE­STROY­ING U.S.</p>
    <p>They want to de­stroy this coun­try and ev­ery­thing that we have fought for and hold dear. They want to steal your lib­erty, your free­dom. They want to con­trol what you see, and think, and be­lieve, so they can con­trol how you live. paign man­ager for Mr Bi­den said: “What you heard tonight was a parade of dark and di­vi­sive fear mon­ger­ing de­signed to dis­tract from the fact that Don­ald Trump does not have an af­fir­ma­tive case to make to the Amer­i­can peo­ple about why he should be re-elected.”</p>
    <p>The Repub­li­can con­ven­tion’s open­ing night also laid out what prom­ises to be a cen­tral theme of the week: that for­mer vice-pres­i­dent Bi­den and his run­ning mate, Sen­a­tor Ka­mala Har­ris, will merely be pup­pets of rad­i­cal left-wing ac­tivists.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral speak­ers ac­cused the mod­er­ate Bi­den of want­ing to de­fund the po­lice and ban frack­ing, though he has re­jected both po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>Two Repub­li­can ris­ing stars – Sen­a­tor Tim Scott of South Carolina, the lone black Repub­li­can in the Se­nate, and Ms Nikki Ha­ley, Mr Trump’s for­mer am­bas­sador to the United Na­tions, who is In­dian Amer­i­can – dis­missed the idea that Mr Bi­den and his party would be bet­ter ste­wards of mi­nor­ity voter in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>“In much of the Demo­cratic Party, it’s now fash­ion­able to say that Amer­ica is racist,” said Ms Ha­ley, widely seen as a pos­si­ble fu­ture pres­i­den­tial con­tender.</p>
    <p>“That is a lie. Amer­ica is not a racist coun­try.”</p>
