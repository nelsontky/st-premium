    <p>Cabby Peter Quek used to make 150 trips a week be­fore the pan­demic struck.</p>
    <p>That has fallen by a third to just more than 100 now.</p>
    <p>The 44-year-old’s monthly take­home in­come is down by half, from $3,000 to $1,500.</p>
    <p>Thank­fully, he qual­i­fied for the Self-Em­ployed Per­son In­come Re­lief Scheme launched in March, which dis­burses $1,000 per month for nine months.</p>
    <p>Ex­plain­ing why his in­come has fallen by half even though the num­ber of trips has not, the cabby of 51/ years, who drives 60 hours a week, said: “Pan­demic or not, what­ever I make in the first few hours of driv­ing goes to cov­er­ing op­er­at­ing costs.</p>
    <p>“It’s only af­ter about seven hours that I break even for the day, and then be­gin to earn my in­come, so the fall in in­come is dis­pro­por­tion­ate to the de­crease in pas­sen­gers.”</p>
    <p>Mr Quek, who tracks his ex­penses and earn­ings us­ing Ex­cel spread­sheets, said his daily op­er­at­ing costs work out to about $180, af­ter rental re­lief from the taxi op­er­a­tor and the Govern­ment.</p>
    <p>“This in­cludes ‘hid­den costs’ that oth­ers might not con­sider, like Medis­ave con­tri­bu­tions and in­come tax de­duc­tions,” said the sin­gle father of two daugh­ters aged 14 and 16. His par­ents live with him.</p>
    <p>“Many driv­ers might not take th­ese into ac­count, but as self-em­ployed per­sons, it’s im­por­tant that we know all the costs our­selves, be­cause we are go­ing to bear them.”</p>
    <p>Mr Quek feels the Covid-19 pan­demic has strength­ened his call for the taxi rental sys­tem to be re­vised.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, he wrote to the Min­istry of Trans­port and Com­fortDelGro propos­ing that in­stead of pay­ing a daily fixed rate, cab­bies should be charged a lower rental, with ad­di­tional charges cal­cu­lated based on how long they use the ve­hi­cle.</p>
    <p>Mr Quek said his sug­ges­tion gives taxi driv­ers more au­ton­omy and en­cour­ages them to take greater own­er­ship in plan­ning their sched­ules.</p>
    <p>“In­stead of slog­ging away for hours just to make up daily rental, a pay-as-you-use sys­tem will let us break even ear­lier in the day and en­joy bet­ter work-life bal­ance,” he said, adding that “be­ing freed from the cur­rent men­tal and phys­i­cal toll of mak­ing rent” will be a big re­lief.</p>
    <p>Mr Quek be­lieves that his pro­posal caters to var­i­ous types of cab­bies, re­gard­less of why and how long they drive.</p>
    <p>“Not all driv­ers have been im­pacted by the pan­demic equally, be­cause not all of us drive full­time.</p>
    <p>“Some are re­tirees who do not need the in­come as much, and can af­ford to drive less. Such a sys­tem will al­low them to,” he said.</p>
