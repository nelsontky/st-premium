    <p>Look­ing at the crest­fallen faces of the Tampines Rovers play­ers at the fi­nal whis­tle of their match against Lion City Sailors yes­ter­day, one would not have been able to tell they had just con­firmed a his­toric qual­i­fi­ca­tion to the group stage of next sea­son’s AFC Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>The Stags played out a 1-1 draw against the Sailors at Bis­han Sta­dium to main­tain their four-point lead over the hosts with just one game left in the Sin­ga­pore Premier League (SPL) sea­son.</p>
    <p>While they will fin­ish as the best lo­cal side and earn a spot at the premier AFC tour­na­ment, the achieve­ment was over­shad­owed by the re­sult. The draw meant Tampines re­lin­quished their po­si­tion at the top of the ta­ble, af­ter Al­birex Ni­igata beat bot­tom side Tan­jong Pa­gar United 3-0 at Jurong East to move one point clear ahead of Satur­day’s fi­nal round of fix­tures.</p>
    <p>With a one-point ad­van­tage, Al­birex will seal their fourth ti­tle in five sea­sons if they win at Hougang, or match Tampines’ re­sult against Gey­lang at Our Tampines Hub.</p>
    <p>The Stags, on the other hand, have to win to stand a bet­ter chance of clinch­ing their first league ti­tle since 2013, and hope the White Swans drop points.</p>
    <p>There is also the pos­si­bil­ity of Tampines win­ning the league on goal dif­fer­ence should they get a point against Gey­lang and Al­birex lose by two goals to Hougang.</p>
    <p>Sailors coach Aure­lio Vid­mar likened the match to a chess game, with his side tak­ing the ini­tia­tive early on and scor­ing via for­mer na­tional skip­per Shahril Ishak, when he squeezed in the ball from a tight an­gle on his sec­ond at­tempt in the 45th minute.</p>
    <p>But the mo­men­tum then swung the visi­tors’ way af­ter Jor­dan Webb was brought on in the sec­ond half. The Cana­dian for­ward chested</p>
    <p>Yasir Hanapi’s cross on to Zehrudin Mehme­dovic to fin­ish past Has­san Sunny in the 63rd minute.</p>
    <p>The Stags just could not muster a third come­back win in five games, with Tampines goal­keeper Syazwan Buhari com­ing up with a big save to deny Hafiz Nor and con­sign Vid­mar’s men to third spot and a place in the AFC Cup.</p>
    <p>Tampines coach Gavin Lee hailed the ef­forts of his team and noted that fa­tigue def­i­nitely played a part in the poor fin­ish­ing shown by both sides.</p>
    <p>He said: “Our boys have made club his­tory and we should feel proud of that. We could have put our­selves in a bet­ter po­si­tion as far as the ti­tle race is con­cerned, but we have put in one year of top work and we will try to fin­ish as strong as we can.”</p>
    <p>Vid­mar added: “We can­not fault the ef­forts of the play­ers who have done an amaz­ing job to play 11 games in 36 days. This was not the re­sult we wanted... we were play­ing catch-up for most of the sea­son, and it could have been dif­fer­ent with a full sea­son.”</p>
    <p>Else­where, the race for the sec­ond AFC Cup spot will also go to the fi­nal day af­ter Balestier Khalsa and Gey­lang In­ter­na­tional pro­duced match­ing 2-1 away wins at Hougang United and Young Lions re­spec­tively to be dead­locked at 19 points, with the Tigers ahead on goal dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Balestier, who play the Sailors on Satur­day, will qual­ify for the AFC Cup as long as they match Gey­lang’s re­sult and main­tain their su­pe­rior goal dif­fer­ence. If both teams have match­ing re­sults, the Eagles have to hope for a four-goal swing to make it to Asia’s sec­ondtier club com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
