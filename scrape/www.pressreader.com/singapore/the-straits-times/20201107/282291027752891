    <p>I thank Mr Kuldip Singh Saggi (Care­givers are the un­sung he­roes of so­ci­ety, Oct 28) and Mr Vin­cent Lim (Pro­fes­sion­ally cer­tify home-based care­givers, Nov 2) for sup­port­ing my sug­ges­tions.</p>
    <p>To en­act a well-cal­i­brated and ro­bust pol­icy that com­pen­sates in­for­mal care­givers and pro­fes­sion­alises care­giv­ing, a sec­ond na­tional study on in­for­mal care­giv­ing should be con­ducted.</p>
    <p>This study should look into the health, well-be­ing, costs and op­por­tu­nity costs of pro­vid­ing in­for­mal care to older adults in Sin­ga­pore, and an­swer dif­fi­cult ques­tions such as the fol­low­ing:</p>
    <p>How many in­for­mal care­givers are there in Sin­ga­pore? What items do they pay for out of pocket to pro­vide care to an older adult at home, and at what cost? How can care­giver bur­den be quan­ti­fied and ad­dressed in a sus­tain­able way? What tech­ni­cal com­pe­ten­cies have care­givers ac­quired ow­ing to care­giv­ing, and at what lev­els of pro­fi­ciency?</p>
    <p>My aca­demic re­search found that care­givers of stroke sur­vivors who were dis­tressed at the start had a 24 per cent prob­a­bil­ity of re­main­ing dis­tressed at the 12-month mark post-stroke.</p>
    <p>My pro­posed na­tional study would in­clude a time di­men­sion, and ask if this trend ap­plies to care­givers of other care re­cip­i­ents and if it per­sists over a longer time hori­zon.</p>
    <p>Apart from an­swer­ing these ques­tions, a na­tional in­ves­ti­ga­tion into in­for­mal care­giv­ing could also point to po­ten­tial solutions to yet-to-be-re­solved is­sues sur­faced by the 2010 Sur­vey on In­for­mal Care­giv­ing that was com­mis­sioned by the for­mer Min­istry of Com­mu­nity De­vel­op­ment, Youth and Sports, such as em­ployed care­givers fac­ing heavy de­mands on their time.</p>
    <p>Some of the above ques­tions were raised in Par­lia­ment but were not ad­e­quately ad­dressed due to lack of data. With a lon­gi­tu­di­nal na­tional study that con­sid­ers vari­a­tions in in­for­mal care­giv­ing ar­range­ments, sub­se­quent par­lia­men­tary de­bates on this topic would be­come more in­sight­ful, and con­se­quent pol­icy solutions would be ev­i­dence-based.</p>
