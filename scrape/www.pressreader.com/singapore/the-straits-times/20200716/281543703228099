    <p>Aus­tralia has im­posed strict lim­its on the num­ber of ex­pa­tri­ates who can re­turn home and will charge them for their 14 days in quar­an­tine, but the mea­sures have been crit­i­cised as deny­ing the ba­sic rights of the coun­try’s cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has im­posed strict lim­its on the num­ber of ex­pa­tri­ates who can re­turn home and will charge them for their 14 days in quar­an­tine, but the mea­sures have been crit­i­cised as deny­ing the ba­sic rights of the na­tion’s cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>With hun­dreds of thou­sands of Aus­tralians liv­ing over­seas, the fed­eral gov­ern­ment has cut weekly ar­rivals of re­turnees from about 7,000 to 4,000. The move fol­lows con­cerns that states and ter­ri­to­ries may be un­able to ac­com­mo­date and mon­i­tor all ar­rivals in quar­an­tine. In the month to last week, about 28,000 Aus­tralians re­turned from abroad, mostly through the Syd­ney air­port.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son said the re­duced flow of in­ter­na­tional ar­rivals was nec­es­sary to en­sure the author­i­ties could con­duct ad­e­quate test­ing and trac­ing. The new lim­its be­gan on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>States and ter­ri­to­ries have also be­gun charg­ing ar­rivals for their stays at quar­an­tine ho­tels.</p>
    <p>New South Wales (NSW) state, the main point of en­try for re­turn­ing cit­i­zens, per­ma­nent res­i­dents and their fam­i­lies, has an­nounced it will charge A$3,000 (S$2,930) for an adult, A$1,000 for an ad­di­tional adult and A$500 per child aged three and over. The charges, which cover food and ac­com­mo­da­tion, will be­gin from Satur­day.</p>
    <p>NSW Pre­mier Gla­dys Bere­jik­lian said the state has spent more than A$65 mil­lion on quar­an­tine for about 35,000 re­turn­ing cit­i­zens since quar­an­tine mea­sures be­gan on March 29.</p>
    <p>“Aus­tralian res­i­dents have been given plenty of time to re­turn home – and we feel it is only fair that they cover some of the costs of their ho­tel ac­com­mo­da­tion,” she said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Other states, such as South Aus­tralia, have in­tro­duced sim­i­lar charges. Western Aus­tralia is charg­ing A$2,520 for an adult, A$3,360 for two adults, and A$5,040 for a fam­ily of four. The charges ex­tend to do­mes­tic trav­ellers who lack a place to self-iso­late.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia had largely sup­pressed the Covid-19 out­break un­til a re­cent wave of cases linked to ho­tels hous­ing in­ter­na­tional trav­ellers in Mel­bourne. The out­break prompted</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s sec­ond-largest city to go back into lock­down for six weeks.</p>
    <p>As of yes­ter­day , Aus­tralia had recorded 10,495 cases of Covid-19 and 111 deaths. Vic­to­ria state yes­ter­day recorded 238 of the coun­try’s 259 new cases. The re­main­der were in NSW and Western Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>The Mel­bourne out­break has led to sev­eral new cases in Syd­ney and prompted states to adopt tighter re­stric­tions, in­clud­ing lim­it­ing trav­ellers from Vic­to­ria and Syd­ney.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria yes­ter­day an­nounced it will re­quire po­lice to wear masks at sta­tions af­ter 57 of­fi­cers were forced to iso­late af­ter com­ing into con­tact with two col­leagues who had the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria Pre­mier Daniel An­drews said the state may in­tro­duce tougher re­stric­tions if peo­ple defy the cur­rent lock­down mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“(If) peo­ple do not do the right thing, then we will have to move to ad­di­tional re­stric­tions be­ing put in place and po­ten­tially pro­long... these re­stric­tions,” he told re­porters.</p>
    <p>NSW this week im­posed new rules on pubs fol­low­ing an out­break cen­tred on a pub in south-west Syd­ney. Ms Bere­jik­lian sig­nalled yes­ter­day that ad­di­tional re­stric­tions for high-risk ac­tiv­i­ties may be in­tro­duced to sup­press fur­ther out­breaks.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the crack­down on Aus­tralians abroad has sparked a back­lash, with ex­pa­tri­ates say­ing they are not a “dan­ger to so­ci­ety” and of­ten have good rea­sons for not hav­ing yet re­turned.</p>
    <p>Ms Amy Knibbs, an Aus­tralian lawyer who re­cently re­turned to Syd­ney from New York, is cur­rently in a quar­an­tine ho­tel, and said the de­ci­sion to charge for quar­an­tine was “cruel” and would pre­vent some ex­pa­tri­ates from re­turn­ing.</p>
    <p>She said it was not easy for all Aus­tralians abroad to quickly pack up their lives and move, es­pe­cially when some may have fam­ily mem­bers abroad or may be forced to give up the visas that al­low them to live in their adopted county.</p>
    <p>“While some may be well-paid fi­nanciers in Dubai or Sin­ga­pore, oth­ers are barely mak­ing a liv­ing teach­ing English in Cam­bo­dia or work­ing in hu­man rights and de­vel­op­ment in Kenya,” she wrote in The Syd­ney Morn­ing Her­ald.</p>
    <p>“In a wealthy coun­try like Aus­tralia, pub­lic health should be paid for by the pub­lic dime, not lumped on those who just hap­pened to be liv­ing over­seas at the wrong time.”</p>
    <p>Another ex­pa­tri­ate, Mr James Mort, who lives in Lon­don, wrote in the Her­ald on Sun­day that re­turn­ing cit­i­zens pose no pub­lic health threat if quar­an­tin­ing and test­ing are well man­aged.</p>
    <p>“The abil­ity for cit­i­zens to re­turn to their coun­try is a fun­da­men­tal hu­man right,” he wrote.</p>
