    <p>HONG KONG • Re­mem­ber Lui Fong?</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong singer, who is fa­mous for songs such as Friends Don’t Cry and The Cres­cent Moon, is now a hus­band and a father.</p>
    <p>It was re­ported last Satur­day that his wife, en­tre­pre­neur Rain­bow Ng, has given birth to a girl.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with the Hong Kong me­dia, Lui, 56, said it was a smooth de­liv­ery and he was very happy.</p>
    <p>“I ac­com­pa­nied my wife to the de­liv­ery room and helped cut the baby’s um­bil­i­cal cord,” the beam­ing father said.</p>
    <p>He added that his baby daugh­ter, who weighs about 3.18kg, looks like him.</p>
    <p>Lui fa­mously dated Hong Kong ac­tress and tele­vi­sion host Carol Cheng, 62, for 16 years be­fore they broke up in 2008.</p>
    <p>He once de­clared dur­ing the courtship that he would nei­ther marry nor have kids.</p>
    <p>He sur­prised fans in May when the Hong Kong me­dia re­ported that he had mar­ried Ms Ng, 40, his girl­friend of seven years.</p>
    <p>He fur­ther sur­prised fans when it was re­vealed that Ms Ng was then five months preg­nant.</p>
