    <p>A woman who sued PUB for $5 mil­lion af­ter she fell into a man­hole and ac­cepted a confidenti­al set­tle­ment of­fer on the fourth day of trial will have to pay over­all le­gal costs of $30,000 to the na­tional wa­ter agency.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the High Court awarded costs of $40,000 to Madam Chan Hui Peng, 47, for le­gal work done from the day she filed the suit in 2018 to the day the of­fer to set­tle was made by PUB on Nov 10 this year.</p>
    <p>But Ju­di­cial Com­mis­sioner An­dre Ma­niam also awarded PUB costs of $70,000, com­pris­ing $48,000 for three days of trial and $22,000 for two amend­ments Madam Chan made to her claim.</p>
    <p>The char­tered ac­coun­tant filed a suit against PUB on Oct 15, 2018, claim­ing dam­ages for in­juries, in­clud­ing a frac­tured an­kle and post­trau­matic stress dis­or­der that she al­legedly suf­fered as a re­sult of the ac­ci­dent in Si­mon Road, near Ko­van, on Dec 1, 2015.</p>
    <p>On Oct 5 this year, her claim was amended to in­clude her re­cent di­ag­no­sis of schizophre­nia as one of the in­juries.</p>
    <p>PUB ac­cepted 70 per cent of the li­a­bil­ity for the ac­ci­dent but dis­puted the na­ture and ex­tent of her in­juries. She had ini­tially claimed the schizophre­nia re­sulted from three po­ten­tial causes: the ac­ci­dent, the stress of lit­i­ga­tion, and be­ing fol­lowed by pri­vate in­ves­ti­ga­tors hired by PUB’s in­sur­ers.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the trial be­gan on Nov 23, Madam Chan amended her case again and dropped the lat­ter two al­leged causes.</p>
    <p>On the evening of Nov 26, af­ter she was grilled on the stand for four days, she ac­cepted PUB’s of­fer to set­tle.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, her lawyers – Mr L. De­vada­son and Mr Ivan Lee from Le­galS­tan­dard – sought costs of $90,000 for work done up to the day the of­fer was made.</p>
    <p>PUB’s lawyers – Mr K. An­parasan and Ms Grace Tan from WhiteFern – sought $95,000 for trial prepa­ra­tion and four days of trial. They also sought $31,000 for the amend­ments.</p>
    <p>Each side ar­gued that the other party should not get costs.</p>
    <p>In giv­ing his de­ci­sion, the ju­di­cial com­mis­sioner noted that there were a num­ber of “un­sat­is­fac­tory” as­pects in Madam Chan’s case.</p>
    <p>He noted that her phys­i­cal in­jury claims were con­tra­dicted by sur­veil­lance footage of her walk­ing with no ap­par­ent dif­fi­culty.</p>
    <p>Ques­tions were also raised about whether she was gen­uinely em­ployed by a firm called HP&S, which turned out to be a dor­mant com­pany owned by her uncle.</p>
    <p>The ju­di­cial com­mis­sioner, how­ever, said the fact re­mains she was in­jured in an ac­ci­dent, for which PUB agreed to be 70 per cent li­able and had made an of­fer to set­tle.</p>
    <p>He mod­er­ated the costs Madam Chan should get be­cause “she seemed to be try­ing to im­prove her case by go­ing to a suc­ces­sion of doc­tors and ask­ing them to change their re­ports”.</p>
    <p>As for PUB’s costs, he noted that un­der court rules, PUB was en­ti­tled to costs from Nov 24 on­wards, or 14 days af­ter the of­fer was served on Madam Chan.</p>
    <p>Thus, PUB could only get costs from Nov 24 to 26, or the sec­ond to fourth day of the trial.</p>
