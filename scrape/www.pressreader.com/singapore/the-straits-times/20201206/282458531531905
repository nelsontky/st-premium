    <p>DU­RA­TION AND DIF­FI­CULTY</p>
    <p>Cover­ing all 25 points will take at least one day. Hop on a bus wher­ever pos­si­ble. An easy walk.</p>
    <p>HIGH­LIGHTS</p>
    <p>Old Jurong line rail­way bridge; Jurong Town Hall; Sci­ence Cen­tre Sin­ga­pore; Ta­man Jurong Mar­ket and Food Cen­tre (site of old Yung Sheng Food Cen­tre); Tuas Pek Kong Tem­ple; Thow Kwang Pot­tery Jun­gle; Jurong Bird Park; Jurong Hill</p>
    <p>THE GOOD</p>
    <p>Jurong is of­ten re­garded as a bor­ing in­dus­trial town, but the high­lights on this trail – from parks and eater­ies to places of wor­ship and pot­tery kilns – will have you see­ing the neigh­bour­hood in a new light.</p>
    <p>Do not miss the mod­ern Jurong Town Hall build­ing, which of­fi­cially opened in 1975 and is a na­tional mon­u­ment. An­other high­light is Thow Kwang Pot­tery Jun­gle – home to a dragon kiln – where you can pick up pot­tery for your home or at­tend pot­tery classes.</p>
    <p>If you want a sweep­ing view of the Jurong in­dus­trial area, go to Jurong Hill and climb up the seven-storey spi­ral look­out tower, which is also near Jurong Bird Park.</p>
    <p>If you need some grub, there is Ta­man Jurong Mar­ket and Food Cen­tre, or Boon Lay Place Mar­ket and Food Vil­lage near the Tuas Pek Kong Tem­ple.</p>
    <p>THE BAD</p>
    <p>Points on the trail are not al­ways num­bered in the or­der they should be vis­ited. For your own san­ity, home in on just a hand­ful of high­lights and craft your own route be­fore go­ing down.</p>
    <p>As of press time, the lo­ca­tion pin for Jurong Rail­way on Roots.gov.sg does not iden­tify the ex­act lo­ca­tion of the old Jurong line rail­way bridge, which is a five-minute walk down the Ulu Pan­dan Park Con­nec­tor.</p>
    <p>Also, Chi­nese Gar­den, Ja­panese Gar­den and Army Mu­seum of Sin­ga­pore are tem­po­rar­ily closed.</p>
    <p>DU­RA­TION AND DIF­FI­CULTY</p>
    <p>Three-and-a-half hours, about 10,000 steps. The map at Roots.gov.sg looks straight­for­ward, but dis­tances be­tween some land­marks are far­ther than I thought.</p>
    <p>HIGH­LIGHTS</p>
    <p>Pasir Ris Park; Man­grove For­est; Loyang Tua Pek Kong Tem­ple</p>
    <p>THE GOOD</p>
    <p>Pasir Ris has been known for its beach hol­i­day vibes since the late 19th cen­tury, when Jewish ty­coon Joseph Elias’ 12-bed­room house, later con­verted into the now-van­ished Pasir Ris Ho­tel, was among the pri­vate coastal bun­ga­lows of the elite. The lure of the sea is still ev­i­dent in this trail.</p>
    <p>At Pasir Ris Park, em­brace the thrill of coastal wildlife-spot­ting. Near carpark B, bird­watch­ers gather on a wooden bridge over Sungei Tampines, one of two rivers in Pasir Ris. Horn­bills, herons and para­keets chit­ter and glide.</p>
    <p>Trees stand an­kle-deep in the brack­ish waters of the park’s Man­grove For­est, where I spy king­fish­ers, crabs and macaques.</p>
    <p>Even the ar­chi­tec­ture has charm­ing nau­ti­cal touches. In Pasir Ris Street 11, Hous­ing Board flats have walls with port­holes or fa­cades fash­ioned like light­houses. The Bum­boat Play­ground, next to Elias Mall,</p>
    <p>fea­tures the epony­mous boat with painted eyes.</p>
    <p>These dopamine hits of nos­tal­gia are fleet­ing, how­ever, and can be ap­pre­ci­ated with­out break­ing one’s stride. My gaze rests briefly, then flut­ters away.</p>
    <p>I sink my teeth in­stead into a full-on sen­sory ex­pe­ri­ence at Loyang Tua Pek Kong in Loyang Way, a tem­ple with glit­ter­ing in­te­ri­ors which wel­comes dif­fer­ent faiths. Tua Pek Kong and other Taoist deities hold court in shrines that ex­tend to the ceil­ing. There are shrines for Gane­sha and</p>
    <p>other Hindu gods, as well as a kera­mat to Datuk Kong, a lo­cal guardian spirit.</p>
    <p>THE BAD</p>
    <p>Pasir Ris is a large neigh­bour­hood and walk­ing around it is no joke. I try to race-walk like a pro, but some­thing dies in­side when I make it to a her­itage spot like Sakya Ten­phel Ling, one of the first Ti­betan tem­ples in South­east Asia, and find the gates shut.</p>
