    <p>Project Power (M18, 113 min­utes, Net­flix, ) is an am­bi­tious take on what is now a stan­dard sci­ence-fic­tion premise of a drug that grants su­per­pow­ers to or­di­nary folk.</p>
    <p>Like thrillers that have used the same idea (Lim­it­less, 2011; Lucy, 2015), it is the old mon­key’s paw hor­ror tale dressed in new clothes, but with the same moral: Those who defy na­ture will face con­se­quences.</p>
    <p>De­fy­ing na­ture here is New Or­leans teenager Robin (Do­minique Fish­back), a dealer in the su­per-stim­u­lant named Power.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Frank (Joseph Gor­don-Le­vitt), a cop, tracks down the source of the drug. Jamie Foxx ap­pears as The Ma­jor, a mys­te­ri­ous su­per-sol­dier who is also look­ing for the mak­ers of the glow­ing or­ange pill.</p>
    <p>There are a cou­ple of fresh twists here, such as the no­tion that swal­low­ing the drug leads to un­pre­dictable re­sults. Its users might de­velop god-like strength or die spec­tac­u­larly.</p>
    <p>There is also an in­con­gru­ously ten­der thread in how so­cial mis­fit Robin (Fish­back) is a whiz at rap­ping, a tal­ent en­cour­aged by one of the male leads, who de­vel­ops a fatherly bond with her.</p>
    <p>It is a set-up that re­calls the Spider-Man tril­ogy (2002 to</p>
    <p>2007), di­rected by Sam Raimi, a se­ries that was a near-per­fect blend of teen com­edy, fam­ily drama and comic-book ac­tion.</p>
    <p>But co-di­rec­tors Henry Joost and Ariel Schul­man have opted to make the ac­tion here gritty and vi­o­lent.</p>
    <p>That tonal con­fu­sion is wors­ened by a story that un­folds through the eyes of all three main char­ac­ters, when set­tling for just Robin’s would have been the best bet.</p>
    <p>The charis­matic Fish­back would also have made a deep and nu­anced Peter Parker. It’s a shame her stage had to be shared with two pa­per-thin male char­ac­ters.</p>
    <p>Slip­ping qui­etly into the HBO Go playlist re­cently is South Korean drama Bori (PG, 105 min­utes, HBO Go, ), a gen­tly mov­ing story about the ti­tle char­ac­ter, an 11-year-old girl.</p>
    <p>Bori (Kim Ah-song) is a coda – child of deaf adults – and her fam­ily’s life­line in a hun­dred small ways, such as call­ing up res­tau­rants for home-de­liv­ery noo­dles and fried chicken.</p>
    <p>Her hear­ing makes her use­ful, but also ex­cludes her from the in­ti­mate bond shared by her par­ents and younger brother, who is also deaf.</p>
    <p>Bori tries to break into their sound­less world in a dis­qui­et­ing but also oddly charm­ing man­ner.</p>
    <p>Her an­tics are mostly a means by which writer-di­rec­tor Kim Jin-yu, who grew up with a deaf mother, de­picts what life is like for a fam­ily whose mem­bers have dis­abil­i­ties in a small, tightly-knit com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>His poignant por­trayal of that life, which snagged him the Best Di­rec­tor award at the Bu­san In­ter­na­tional Film Fes­ti­val, makes a case for how peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties are ev­ery­where, but only if the able-bod­ied choose to see.</p>
    <p>The com­ing-of-age drama</p>
    <p>Martin Eden (NC16, 129 min­utes, $8 for a 48-hour ren­tal pe­riod at the­p­ro­jec­tor.sg, ) is the lat­est adap­ta­tion of the 1909 novel by Amer­i­can au­thor Jack Lon­don, and avail­able for stream­ing here as part of the Ital­ian Film Fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>Di­rec­tor Pi­etro Mar­cello and his team take cer­tain lib­er­ties with the source ma­te­rial, such as by not spec­i­fy­ing the pe­riod but also mov­ing the ac­tion to Naples, Italy.</p>
    <p>What is taken from the book in a more ver­ba­tim man­ner is the per­sonal phi­los­o­phy of the ti­tle char­ac­ter, played with a great deal of mag­netism by Luca Marinelli, whose phys­i­cal­ity will re­mind view­ers of a young Ger­ard Depar­dieu, the French ac­tor.</p>
    <p>Eden is an odd-job labourer who falls in love with Elena (Jessica Cressy), daugh­ter of an in­dus­tri­al­ist. They can never be a cou­ple, she in­sists, un­til he bet­ters him­self through ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>What fol­lows is a hero’s jour­ney through the creative mind, shown by Eden’s evo­lu­tion from naive, happy young man to a bit­ter but wiser mid­dle-aged adult.</p>
    <p>As in the book, Marinelli’s Eden is gripped by the ideas of the now­for­got­ten Her­bert Spencer, the English philoso­pher whose prin­ci­ples might to­day be broadly called right-lean­ing lib­er­tar­ian.</p>
    <p>Mar­cello does what he can to make Eden’s in­ner growth cin­e­matic, but the re­sults are un­even.</p>
    <p>Eden speechi­fies and makes bizarre choices in some places; else­where, flash­backs do the job.</p>
    <p>Learn­ing about the price one pays for en­light­en­ment should not be this hard.</p>
