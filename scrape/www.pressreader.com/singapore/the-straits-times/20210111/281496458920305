    <p>The num­ber of im­ported cases in Sin­ga­pore has been grad­u­ally creep­ing up since the mid­dle of last month, with over 560 such in­fec­tions since Dec 15.</p>
    <p>But ex­perts say the trend is not sur­pris­ing, given that Sin­ga­pore is re­open­ing its borders and the surge in cases glob­ally. Ex­perts say the rise is also a sign that de­tec­tion mea­sures are work­ing.</p>
    <p>The rise in im­ported Covid-19 cases here is to be ex­pected, ex­perts said, adding that it is an in­di­ca­tion of Sin­ga­pore’s lift­ing of border re­stric­tions and the suc­cess of mea­sures to screen out in­fec­tions amid a rise in cases glob­ally.</p>
    <p>From Dec 15 to yes­ter­day, Sin­ga­pore iden­ti­fied 562 im­ported cases from 31 dif­fer­ent coun­tries. The num­ber of daily cases was in the dou­ble dig­its, com­pared with the pe­riod be­tween Oc­to­ber and Novem­ber when fewer than 10 im­ported cases were recorded daily.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore had uni­lat­er­ally lifted border re­stric­tions since Septem­ber, grad­u­ally al­low­ing into the coun­try vis­i­tors from Brunei, China, New Zealand, Viet­nam, Aus­tralia and Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>This eas­ing of re­stric­tions was also ex­tended to new work per­mit and S Pass ap­pli­ca­tions across all sec­tors, to al­le­vi­ate the man­power short­age faced by busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Josip Car, di­rec­tor of the Cen­tre for Pop­u­la­tion Health Sciences at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, said the rise is ex­pected, “given the in­ten­si­fi­ca­tion of the Covid-19 disease glob­ally, es­pe­cially with the dis­cov­ery of the new and highly trans­mis­si­ble strain of the virus”.</p>
    <p>Case num­bers are surg­ing i n many of the coun­tries of ori­gin of those ar­riv­ing here, said Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher, who is from the Depart­ment of Medicine at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, Bri­tain saw 417,620 peo­ple test pos­i­tive from Jan 3 to 9, 75,674 more than in the pre­vi­ous week. Bri­tain has been the third­largest source of im­ported cases since Dec 15, with 32 trav­ellers test­ing pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Prof Fisher, who is also chair of the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s Global Out­break Alert and Re­sponse Net­work, said many of those from high-preva­lence coun­tries will test pos­i­tive dur­ing their 14-day stay-home no­tice in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The num­ber placed on stayhome no­tice, which in­cludes al­most all trav­ellers, rose to 16,695 on Dec 15, up from 14,805 on Nov 15.</p>
    <p>But the pro­por­tion of those on stay-home no­tice test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19 has re­mained low.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Sin­ga­pore saw 35 im­ported cases on Jan 3, or 0.002 per cent of the 18,426 peo­ple on stay-home no­tice at that point.</p>
    <p>Prof Car added that the higher num­ber is “a good sign that our de­tec­tion mea­sures are suc­cess­ful in screen­ing out in­fected cases, given that com­mu­nity spread is still low”.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Alex Cook of the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health said he is not con­cerned.</p>
    <p>“Un­like the first quar­ter of last year, trav­ellers from high-risk source coun­tries are sub­ject to ho­tel-based quar­an­tine, which sub­stan­tially re­duces the risk of spillover.</p>
    <p>“Since Au­gust, we’ve seen con­sis­tent lev­els of im­ported cases but hardly any com­mu­nity cases. That sug­gests the cur­rent quar­an­tine regime is work­ing,” added Prof Cook, the vice-dean of re­search and do­main leader of bio­statis­tics and mod­el­ling at the school.</p>
    <p>The ex­perts said the num­ber of im­ported cases is un­likely to fall un­less the rate of trans­mis­sion over­seas does, or Sin­ga­pore re­duces its num­ber of ar­rivals.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Prof Fisher pointed out that peo­ple trav­el­ling here do so for im­por­tant so­cial or busi­ness rea­sons, and the vast ma­jor­ity of them do not have Covid-19.</p>
    <p>He added: “We are ask­ing a lot from our ho­tels and they should be com­mended for their con­tri­bu­tion to Sin­ga­pore’s re­sponse to Covid-19. They are per­form­ing tasks far be­yond what they are de­signed for. And be­cause of their ef­forts, travel is en­abled (and) the health­care sys­tem will not be over­whelmed by im­ported cases.”</p>
    <p>Prof Cook said that even if a few in­fected trav­ellers are missed, their po­ten­tial im­pact can be “mopped up” by the safe man­age­ment mea­sures in place in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>He added that the slight uptick in com­mu­nity cases is the re­sult of the coun­try grad­u­ally open­ing up.</p>
    <p>“Phase three is char­ac­terised by greater nor­malcy than phase two, which of course means the risk of trans­mis­sion is higher. We be­lieve this can be coun­tered by the safe man­age­ment mea­sures that we have in place now, though time will tell whether the bal­ance is still right,” he said.</p>
    <p>Prof Car said Sin­ga­pore should next look to get­ting the vac­ci­na­tion regime in place while main­tain­ing re­spon­si­ble be­hav­iour to cur­tail pos­si­ble trans­mis­sions.</p>
    <p>“With grow­ing num­bers of peo­ple be­ing vac­ci­nated, the world is hop­ing to pre­vent se­ri­ous in­fec­tions and even­tu­ally re­duce the risk of a wors­en­ing out­break,” he added.</p>
    <p>EF­FEC­TIVE QUAR­AN­TINE REGIME</p>
    <p>Since Au­gust, we’ve seen con­sis­tent lev­els of im­ported cases but hardly any com­mu­nity cases. That sug­gests the cur­rent quar­an­tine regime is work­ing.</p>
