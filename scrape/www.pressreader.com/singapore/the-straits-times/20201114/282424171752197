    <p>STRONG IN­VESTOR CON­FI­DENCE</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) has raised $850 mil­lion through a con­vert­ible bond is­sue that re­ceived strong in­ter­est from in­sti­tu­tional in­vestors.</p>
    <p>The of­fer was more than four times over­sub­scribed, said the air­line yes­ter­day, adding: “As a re­sult, the is­suance was up­sized from the ini­tial $750 mil­lion to $850 mil­lion with more at­trac­tive terms for SIA.”</p>
    <p>Pro­ceeds from the bond is­sue will be used to fund op­er­at­ing and cap­i­tal ex­pen­di­ture, as well as to ser­vice debts, said the flag car­rier.</p>
    <p>The five-year con­vert­ible bonds will carry a coupon of 1.625 per cent a year and be is­sued at par.</p>
    <p>The bonds can be con­verted into or­di­nary shares at $5.743 for each new or­di­nary share. This rep­re­sents a pre­mium of about 45.8 per cent over SIA’s last clos­ing stock price on Thurs­day of $3.94.</p>
    <p>If the bonds are all con­verted, the com­pany will al­lot and is­sue about 148 mil­lion new or­di­nary shares, which make up about 5 per cent of the ex­ist­ing is­sued shares, ex­clud­ing trea­sury shares.</p>
    <p>The un­sub­or­di­nated and un­se­cured bonds will ma­ture on Dec 3, 2025.</p>
    <p>SIA said all the con­vert­ible bonds have been fully placed to in­sti­tu­tional and other in­vestors.</p>
    <p>The hold­ers can opt to con­vert them at least 41 days af­ter the date of is­sue up to the close of busi­ness on the 10th day prior to the ma­tu­rity date, both dates in­clu­sive.</p>
    <p>SIA chief ex­ec­u­tive Goh Choon Phong noted that the place­ment was ex­e­cuted with a “highly com­pet­i­tive coupon and sub­stan­tial con­ver­sion pre­mium”.</p>
    <p>“Such at­trac­tive terms for the com­pany un­der­score the strong con­fi­dence that in­vestors have in Sin­ga­pore Air­lines, as well as our abil­ity to suc­cess­fully over­come the near-term chal­lenges and emerge as a leader in the air­line in­dus­try,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, SIA raised $8.8 bil­lion from a rights is­sue, and has the op­tion of rais­ing up to an­other $6.2 bil­lion in ad­di­tional manda­tory con­vert­ible bonds, which it can ex­er­cise by July next year.</p>
    <p>As an il­lus­tra­tion, the net tan­gi­ble as­set (NTA) per share af­ter the bonds are is­sued but be­fore any con­ver­sion would be $5.06, based on the group’s unau­dited fi­nan­cial state­ments as at Sept 30 this year, com­pared with $5.04 be­fore the is­suance, SIA said.</p>
    <p>As­sum­ing full con­ver­sion of the bonds, the ad­justed NTA per share is es­ti­mated to be $5.07, based on the fi­nan­cial state­ments as at Sept 30.</p>
    <p>Net gear­ing would stand at 0.26 times af­ter the bonds are is­sued, and im­prove to 0.2 times as­sum­ing full con­ver­sion, from 0.27 times as re­ported in the Sept 30 fi­nan­cial state­ments.</p>
    <p>SIA will ap­ply to list the con­vert­ible bonds and new shares aris­ing from the con­ver­sion on the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change.</p>
    <p>HSBC was the sole bookrun­ner and lead man­ager of the deal.</p>
    <p>SIA shares fell 2.79 per cent to $3.83 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Such at­trac­tive terms for the com­pany un­der­score the strong con­fi­dence that in­vestors have in Sin­ga­pore Air­lines, as well as our abil­ity to suc­cess­fully over­come the near-term chal­lenges and emerge as a leader in the air­line in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>SIN­GA­PORE AIR­LINES CHIEF EX­EC­U­TIVE GOH CHOON PHONG, not­ing that the place­ment was ex­e­cuted with a “highly com­pet­i­tive coupon and sub­stan­tial con­ver­sion pre­mium”.</p>
