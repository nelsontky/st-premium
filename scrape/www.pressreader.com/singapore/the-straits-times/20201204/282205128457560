    <p>A se­rial con­man, freed from prison in Oc­to­ber last year, re­turned to his old ways this year by pre­tend­ing to be a fe­male nurse in calls he made to hos­pi­tals here.</p>
    <p>In a video call, he was able to con­vince a preg­nant pa­tient to demon­strate how she mas­sages her ab­domen.</p>
    <p>In sep­a­rate phone calls, he told nurses to move pa­tients to dif­fer­ent wards as well as de­liv­ery suites – acts that could im­pact the hos­pi­tals’ op­er­a­tions, the court heard.</p>
    <p>Kelvin Pang Lock Sheng, who does not suf­fer from a men­tal ill­ness, claimed that he made the calls as he “wanted to speak to some­one”.</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old was sen­tenced on Wed­nes­day to 14 months and seven weeks’ jail af­ter plead­ing guilty to six counts of com­mu­ni­cat­ing a false mes­sage and four un­re­lated cheat­ing charges.</p>
    <p>He also has to spend an ad­di­tional six days be­hind bars for breach­ing a re­mis­sion or­der on Jan 22 this year when he cheated a woman of $28.</p>
    <p>The or­der for his early re­lease from prison re­quired him to stay out of trou­ble from Oct 29 last year to Jan 27 this year.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, he made a series of calls be­tween Jan­uary and April this year to wards in the Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hospi­tal (SGH) and Na­tional Univer­sity Hospi­tal (NUH).</p>
    <p>On Jan 31, Pang, who worked part-time by play­ing mu­sic for fu­neral ser­vice com­pa­nies, called a preg­nant pa­tient in NUH.</p>
    <p>“The ac­cused con­vinced the pa­tient that he was a nurse and the pa­tient showed the ac­cused how she mas­saged her stom­ach over a video call,” Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Norine Tan told a district court.</p>
    <p>He even asked her to show him her pri­vate parts but she re­fused, the DPP added.</p>
    <p>On Feb 5, Pang put on a woman’s voice and, pre­tend­ing to be a labour ward nurse, spoke to an­other NUH pa­tient, a 29-year-old ex­pec­tant mother who was due to de­liver her child the next day.</p>
    <p>He told her that he would “bring her through the steps of labour”.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim learnt the truth af­ter speak­ing to a nurse who had en­tered her room.</p>
    <p>The DPP said: “The vic­tim, who was al­ready fac­ing the pres­sure of child­birth, was con­se­quently very con­cerned about how her (mobile phone) num­ber was ob­tained by a stranger.</p>
    <p>“The ac­cused had un­fairly put her through this stress dur­ing the al­ready stress­ful pe­riod.”</p>
    <p>It was not stated how he got her num­ber.</p>
    <p>On other oc­ca­sions, he had called nurses to move pa­tients to the de­liv­ery suite or other wards.</p>
    <p>Both hos­pi­tals alerted the po­lice and Pang was ar­rested on April 11.</p>
    <p>As for the cheat­ing of­fences, the court heard that he had duped mul­ti­ple women of more than $200 in to­tal by get­ting them to top up the pre­paid card in his mobile phone.</p>
