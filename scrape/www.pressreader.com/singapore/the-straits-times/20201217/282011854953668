    <p>I re­fer to Mr Colin Loh Yoon Fui’s let­ter (As­sisted liv­ing flats not suited for those who need per­ma­nent help with daily ac­tiv­i­ties, Dec 15).</p>
    <p>As­sisted liv­ing, as its name sug­gests, is not a re­tire­ment vil­lage per se, but is in­stead a part of the care con­tin­uum as a per­son ages.</p>
    <p>Up un­til 2015, when Sin­ga­pore’s first as­sisted liv­ing fa­cil­ity was rolled out, the only care op­tion that se­niors had was nurs­ing homes if they could not cope with care at home.</p>
    <p>As­sisted liv­ing hopes to fill this yawn­ing gap be­tween in­de­pen­dent liv­ing and nurs­ing-home-level care.</p>
    <p>Each per­son has in­stru­men­tal ac­tiv­i­ties of daily liv­ing (ADLs) such as cook­ing, clean­ing and shop­ping, and the six ba­sic</p>
    <p>ADLs of wash­ing, toi­let­ing, dressing, feed­ing, mo­bil­ity and trans­fer­ring.</p>
    <p>As a per­son ages, in­stru­men­tal ADLs are the first to be lost for var­i­ous rea­sons such as back prob­lems, os­teoarthri­tis and mild cog­ni­tive im­pair­ment.</p>
    <p>Sub­se­quently, the se­nior may start to re­quire help with one or two ba­sic ADLs.</p>
    <p>As­sisted liv­ing fa­cil­i­ties are specif­i­cally de­signed to cater to se­niors who re­quire as­sis­tance with their in­stru­men­tal ADLs as well as one or two ba­sic ADLs.</p>
    <p>The As­sisted Liv­ing Fa­cil­i­ties As­so­ci­a­tion (Alfa) has ad­vo­cated that as­sisted liv­ing fa­cil­i­ties ad­mit se­niors who may need help with a max­i­mum of two ba­sic ADLs, af­ter which they should be tran­si­tioned to a higher-care needs fa­cil­ity like a nurs­ing home for safety rea­sons.</p>
    <p>The care tran­si­tion plan that has been thought­fully put in place at the Com­mu­nity Care Apart­ments en­sures that se­niors who are as­sessed to need as­sis­tance with more than two ba­sic ADLs will have pri­or­ity for place­ment at the nearby Bukit Ba­tok Care Home.</p>
    <p>The re­tire­ment vil­lage that Mr Loh may be re­fer­ring to should ideally en­com­pass the en­tire con­tin­uum of care, in­clud­ing in­de­pen­dent liv­ing, as­sisted liv­ing and nurs­ing home lev­els of care. The Com­mu­nity Care Apart­ments do not.</p>
    <p>Se­nior age­ing is a con­tin­u­ous process. Alfa has iden­ti­fied as­sisted liv­ing as the miss­ing link in Sin­ga­pore’s el­der­care land­scape and is thus hop­ing to ed­u­cate the pub­lic on its fea­tures and ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>Mr Loh may want to con­sider Kam­pung Ad­mi­ralty in­stead as an al­ter­na­tive for in­de­pen­dent liv­ing.</p>
    <p>I hope this helps to clar­ify the con­cept of as­sisted liv­ing and I in­vite the pub­lic to con­tact Alfa for more in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Belinda Wee (Dr)</p>
