    <p>BEI­JING • Chi­nese ac­tress Qin Lan, who played Em­press Fuca in the hit Chi­nese pe­riod drama Story Of Yanxi Palace (2018), has strong words for those who are ex­ces­sively con­cerned about her per­sonal life.</p>
    <p>In a re­cent in­ter­view with Chi­nese me­dia, the 40-year-old ac­tress was asked about her thoughts on mar­riage.</p>
    <p>She said while she had felt pres­sure to get mar­ried a few years ago, she be­lieves that “just like act­ing, love and mar­riage have to hap­pen nat­u­rally, with­out any de­mands or ex­pec­ta­tions”.</p>
    <p>She added that she is not ready to tie the knot – a de­ci­sion for which she has been crit­i­cised. “Some have said my de­ci­sion not to get mar­ried is be­cause I do not want to be re­spon­si­ble”.</p>
    <p>Qin added that she had al­ways “found the thought very strange”. She noted: “Isn’t it more ir­re­spon­si­ble to get mar­ried for mar­riage’s sake?”</p>
    <p>The in­ter­view then moved on to a dis­cus­sion about child­birth. The ac­tress, in re­sponse to those who say hav­ing chil­dren is a woman’s duty, said heat­edly: “Whether my uterus is used or not, what busi­ness is it of yours?”</p>
    <p>Many fe­male ne­ti­zens praised her frank­ness and pro­gres­sive thoughts on wom­an­hood, with many sup­port­ing her de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>One wrote: “I think it’s good not to get mar­ried. I have a lot of time to do my own things. There is more to a woman’s life than mar­riage and child-rear­ing.”</p>
    <p>Another said: “The de­ci­sion to not get mar­ried or not have chil­dren shouldn’t be seen as an ill­ness. Rather, it is the idea that mar­riage and child­birth are a must that is the ill­ness.”</p>
