    <p>One all-im­por­tant re­quire­ment when for­mu­lat­ing new so­cial sup­port schemes is to keep pro­grammes fis­cally sus­tain­able, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He also stressed that Sin­ga­pore’s so­cial safety nets should be paid for out of cur­rent rev­enues as a mat­ter of prin­ci­ple. “We should not draw down on what we have in­her­ited, nor should we mort­gage the fu­ture of our chil­dren,” he said, on the third day of de­bate in Par­lia­ment on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress.</p>
    <p>Af­ter sev­eral gen­er­a­tions of fru­gal pru­dence, Sin­ga­pore has man­aged to build up sig­nif­i­cant re­serves, he noted.</p>
    <p>“Now the op­po­si­tion says, show me how much we have in the re­serves be­fore I de­cide whether I sup­port your Bud­get and tax plans. Let’s have a look at the money.</p>
    <p>“Ba­si­cally, they’re ask­ing, I have some­thing in the bank al­ready. How much of that can I touch?” said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>Such an at­ti­tude held by the op­po­si­tion is “fun­da­men­tally the wrong ap­proach”, he added.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s found­ing gen­er­a­tion, when build­ing up the na­tion’s re­serves, had never asked them­selves whether they had too much sav­ings, he said. “We were in our early days of na­tion­hood, things were so un­cer­tain and no one knew what the next day would bring.</p>
    <p>“Com­pared to to­day’s wages then, in­comes then were low, but it was never a ques­tion of how much re­serves would be enough,” he added. Rather, the ques­tion was whether Sin­ga­pore could steadily squir­rel away a bit more in its re­serves year af­ter year, decade af­ter decade as pro­tec­tion for a rainy day.</p>
    <p>There can be no good an­swer to the ques­tion of how much re­serves is enough, or too much, he said.</p>
    <p>“The fu­ture is un­know­able. We have no way to tell what may hit us from out of the blue,” he added, point­ing to how the past nine months have played out.</p>
    <p>In January, be­fore the Covid-19 cri­sis hit Sin­ga­pore, the Fi­nance Min­istry had been pre­par­ing the 2020 Bud­get.</p>
    <p>He re­called the Gov­ern­ment then was con­fi­dent it could meet its cur­rent com­mit­ments and set aside funds for the long term, and had ex­pected to have some­thing left at the end of the term of gov­ern­ment to add to past re­serves.</p>
    <p>“But just a few months af­ter that, we are down more than $70 bil­lion and we have had to draw heav­ily on past re­serves to fund four, five Bud­get pack­ages,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore was able to build up sig­nif­i­cant re­serves due to sev­eral gen­er­a­tions of fru­gal pru­dence, and in the face of “this enor­mous mon­ster storm, we’ve been able to draw on (the) re­serves and fund our es­sen­tial Bud­get pack­ages and help peo­ple on a very big scale”.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans, there­fore, should not think of them­selves as “in­her­i­tors spend­ing what we have been lucky enough to be en­dowed with”.</p>
    <p>They should see them­selves as founders for the fu­ture gen­er­a­tions, PM Lee added.</p>
    <p>“Let us not think of touch­ing them in normal times.” They are Sin­ga­pore’s rainy day fund, he said.</p>
    <p>“That is the way to build Sin­ga­pore for the long term and se­cure the fu­ture for our chil­dren and grand­chil­dren.”</p>
