    <p>Mick­leth­wait The last time we spoke, you talked very elo­quently about Sin­ga­pore’s role in Asia, about the ris­ing power of China and about some of the dif­fi­cul­ties of be­ing an ally of Amer­ica in this par­tic­u­lar re­gion. And I won­dered from all those per­spec­tives, what should Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den... do in terms of a pol­icy to­wards the re­gion and to­wards China in par­tic­u­lar?</p>
    <p>PM Lee I think his first pri­or­i­ties will be do­mes­tic. He has got many ur­gent things to deal with, start­ing with Covid-19. Asia is a very im­por­tant part of the world for Amer­ica, and China par­tic­u­larly. I hope that he will be able to fo­cus his mind on de­vel­op­ing a frame­work for an over­all con­struc­tive relationsh­ip with China. That means one where you are go­ing to be com­pet­ing, where there will be is­sues to deal with, but where you do not want to col­lide and will try very hard to de­velop the ar­eas of com­mon in­ter­est and con­strain the ar­eas of dis­agree­ment.</p>
    <p>Within that frame­work, deal with trade, se­cu­rity, cli­mate change, non-pro­lif­er­a­tion, North Korea – all the many is­sues which the two big­gest pow­ers in the world have to fo­cus on. Among those will also be is­sues... of con­cern to all the rest of us in Asia, who are watch­ing care­fully to see how things will de­velop. Be­cause the last four years have been quite a tu­mul­tuous ride.</p>
    <p>Mick­leth­wait Do you think that (United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald) Trump has done per­ma­nent dam­age or changed the way that Amer­ica is viewed in the re­gion?</p>
    <p>PM Lee I think that there will be some long-term im­pact on per­spec­tives on Amer­ica, and on how Amer­ica views it­self. It did not start with Trump, but over the last four years there has been a clearer shift. When you talk about putting Amer­ica first and mak­ing Amer­ica great again, it is a more nar­row def­i­ni­tion of where Amer­ica’s in­ter­ests lie than has hitherto been the way US ad­min­is­tra­tions have seen things.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ous ad­min­is­tra­tions have seen Amer­ica as hav­ing a broad in­ter­est in the sta­bil­ity of the re­gion and the well-be­ing of its part­ners, in the tend­ing of its al­liances with al­lies, in fos­ter­ing an over­all en­vi­ron­ment where many coun­tries can pros­per in an or­derly scheme, and Amer­ica is part of that scheme and sub­jects it­self to the same rules.</p>
    <p>It will take some time for Amer­ica to come back to such a po­si­tion, and for oth­ers to be con­vinced that it is tak­ing such a po­si­tion. It may never come back all the way, cer­tainly in the short term and cer­tainly in terms of its relationsh­ip with China.</p>
    <p>Once you im­pose puni­tive tar­iffs, once you put them on, what­ever their mer­its, no suc­ces­sor gov­ern­ment can just say those were the wrong things to do and I take them away. You have to deal with it, but you are deal­ing from a new start­ing point.</p>
    <p>There are many other steps which are even more sharp in that way. On tech­nol­ogy, the def­i­ni­tion of how you see the other party – whether it is a com­peti­tor, whether it is a chal­lenger, whether it is a strate­gic threat, whether it is a mor­tal en­emy – th­ese are state­ments which have con­se­quences.</p>
    <p>Mick­leth­wait One of the things that peo­ple have talked about Bi­den do­ing is hav­ing a kind of coali­tion of democ­ra­cies that would bring in peo­ple like your­self, In­done­sia, Ja­pan, South Korea. Is that part of the frame­work that you could imag­ine work­ing?</p>
    <p>PM Lee We all want to work to­gether with the US. We all want to work to­gether with other vi­brant economies. We would like to co­op­er­ate within the re­gion. I think not very many coun­tries would like to join a coali­tion against those who have been ex­cluded, chief of whom would be China. Not just Sin­ga­pore and not just in Asia, I think even in Europe there will be coun­tries who want to do busi­ness with China. For ex­am­ple, the EU is try­ing to con­clude an i nvest­ment agree­ment with China.</p>
    <p>It is quite un­der­stand­able, and I think it is bet­ter. You want ev­ery­body in the dis­cus­sion when try­ing to work out ad­just­ments to the world or­der. In that process, you are go­ing to have peo­ple form al­liances, they will co­op­er­ate with one another, they will try and find com­mon cause. But to try and make a line-up, Cold War style, I do not think that is on the cards.</p>
    <p>Mick­leth­wait Do you re­gard the CPTPP (Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship) as dead? Is that gone or do you think that it is pos­si­ble to re­vive?</p>
    <p>PM Lee The CPTPP is very much alive. There were 12 at the party... one fell out, and now there are 11. The 11 car­ried on with the party. It was to the great credit of Mr (Shinzo) Abe, who was then Prime</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter of Ja­pan, that he held it to­gether and brought ev­ery­body back on and we con­cluded the CPTPP.</p>
    <p>Amer­ica is not part of it. We hope that one day Amer­ica will come back to it. I do not think re­al­is­ti­cally that is go­ing to hap­pen any time soon. The stars are not aligned.</p>
    <p>The Democrats, I do not think their base is very keen on this. The Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion, which Bi­den was part of, was keen on this. Hil­lary Clin­ton, who was Sec­re­tary of State, fully sup­ported it. But when she be­came Hil­lary Clin­ton the can­di­date, she had to re­pu­di­ate it. It is the re­al­ity of Amer­i­can pol­i­tics. I still think that it makes sense for the US, but it has to make do­mes­tic po­lit­i­cal sense as well. That will take time and a dif­fer­ent align­ment of the eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion as well as the po­lit­i­cal con­fig­u­ra­tion in the US.</p>
    <p>Mick­leth­wait On that par­tic­u­lar point, do you think that there is a pos­si­bil­ity that Bi­den gen­er­ally could end up be­ing some­what tougher in terms of ev­ery­day things than Trump was? To the ex­tent that Bi­den is more likely to com­plain with China about hu­man rights. And you have also got this side of the Demo­cratic Party for whom things like labour rights, en­vi­ron­men­tal rights mat­ter enor­mously? In some ways, de­spite be­ing pre­dictable, he could be tougher?</p>
    <p>PM Lee It is pos­si­ble. He knows (Chi­nese Pres­i­dent) Xi Jin­ping very well be­cause they spent many hours to­gether with Xi, who vis­ited the US, and he (Bi­den) vis­ited China too. They have en­gaged one another. That per­sonal en­gage­ment at the top is im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>Equally im­por­tant is how each coun­try sees the other and the in­ten­tions of the other, and whether they see the pos­si­bil­ity of be­ing able to work to­gether to mit­i­gate the in­evitable con­tra­dic­tions which are go­ing to arise be­tween them.</p>
    <p>It is not al­ways easy but it is pos­si­ble. It has his­tor­i­cally hap­pened with many ad­min­is­tra­tions, who will make very fierce state­ments on the cam­paign trail. Once you be­come the ad­min­is­tra­tion, you have to deal with re­al­i­ties, and you have to pivot. Bill Clin­ton did that. He is the one who (as a can­di­date) talked about cod­dling dic­ta­tors from Bagh­dad to Bei­jing, but (as Pres­i­dent) he did busi­ness with China.</p>
    <p>I hope that some­thing like that can hap­pen with the next ad­min­is­tra­tion, but I think it is harder be­cause the con­sen­sus to see China as a strate­gic threat is al­most be­com­ing re­ceived wis­dom and un­ques­tion­able in the US, in Wash­ing</p>
    <p>ton. It will be very dif­fi­cult for any ad­min­is­tra­tion, whether it is Bi­den or, on the other side, Trump, to dis­re­gard that and then just pro­ceed as if the last few years had not taken place.</p>
    <p>Mick­leth­wait What about on the other side? Do you think the Chi­nese are pre­pared to do bar­gains about this? It takes two to tango.</p>
    <p>PM Lee Yes, it does. This is a bi­lat­eral relationsh­ip. I do not think the Chi­nese want a col­li­sion. I think they know they are not ready for a col­li­sion. But I am not sure that they are pre­pared to give a lot of ground, and their prin­ci­pal con­sid­er­a­tion will be a do­mes­tic one, rather than the in­ter­na­tional bal­ance.</p>
    <p>In­tel­lec­tu­ally, and in an ab­stract sense, they will agree when you tell them that they used to be 4 per cent of the world’s trade and are now 13 per cent or so. The rules which are set­tled when you were 4 per cent have to be up­dated now that you are 13 per cent. You have to make cer­tain changes. Changes to the over­all bal­ance of con­tri­bu­tions to the over­all sys­tem, and also changes to deal with par­tic­u­lar griev­ances and is­sues which have arisen on spe­cific prob­lems, whether it is trade or whether it is se­cu­rity is­sues.</p>
    <p>In the ab­stract, I think they will agree to, if not to a shift, at least a change in the tra­jec­tory. In prac­tice, when push comes to shove and you have to ne­go­ti­ate a new dis­pen­sa­tion, I think there are hard bar­gains. It is not clear that be­tween the two sides, they will be able to move to a new po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>I can un­der­stand the dif­fi­culty, be­cause we are where we are, as a re­sult of 30 to 40 years of lib­er­al­i­sa­tion and re­form and open­ing up. In the process, China has got­ten more af­flu­ent, more pow­er­ful.</p>
    <p>The part­ners of China have also ben­e­fited from China’s emer­gence as an econ­omy, its con­nec­tion to the world, its pro­duc­tion of man­u­fac­tured goods, its con­sump­tion of ev­ery­thing from aero­planes to movies and financial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese nar­ra­tive would be: It has been win-win, we should all re­joice, why does any­thing need to be i mproved? Ac­tu­ally, things have got­ten bet­ter, yet many coun­tries do feel that things do need to be ad­justed. That ad­just­ment will be very dif­fi­cult to make.</p>
    <p>Mick­leth­wait</p>
    <p>From your per­spec­tive as a democ­racy, how im­por­tant is what is hap­pen­ing in Hong Kong, where you are see­ing the pro-demo­cratic peo­ple re­sign. Most peo­ple would read it as be­ing a clam­p­down on free­doms in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>PM Lee We watch care­fully and with some con­cern what is hap­pen­ing in Hong Kong and re­sponses in Hong Kong. That some­thing was go­ing to hap­pen, was very much on the cards and could not have been avoided, be­cause the demon­stra­tions and ex­pres­sions of de­fi­ance could not have car­ried on in­def­i­nitely. Cer­tainly not to the end of “one coun­try, two sys­tems” i n 2047.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion was how it could be headed off. The Chi­nese gov­ern­ment have set­tled on this for­mu­la­tion where they have made the leg­is­la­tion in China, in the Na­tional Peo­ple’s Congress, and the ad­min­is­tra­tion in Hong Kong has fol­lowed through and car­ried out those new rules.</p>
    <p>We hope that it could be done in a way which would deal with a prob­lem but not shake confidence, and main­tain the Hong Kong sys­tem in­tact, so that it can be valu­able to China and can be part of the pros­per­ity in the re­gion. There is a lot of con­cern in Hong Kong, and you can see the way ac­tions have re­ac­tions and fur­ther anx­i­eties arise. I hope it can set­tle down to a new norm. It will not go back to where it was, but some­thing which is sus</p>
    <p>tain­able, which will en­able the Hong Kong peo­ple to live sta­bly and have the econ­omy work­ing and have a greater de­gree of the free­doms and ac­cess to in­for­ma­tion and ex­pres­sion than per­tains on the other side of “one coun­try, two sys­tems”.</p>
    <p>Mick­leth­wait Jump­ing back to trade. We be­gan with TPP, but there is also the RCEP (Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship)... Do you re­gard that re­motely as a com­par­a­tive thing to TPP?</p>
    <p>PM Lee It is a dif­fer­ent an­i­mal, for a dif­fer­ent pur­pose. The TPP had a rel­a­tively small num­ber of economies... It went for very deep agree­ment re­quir­ing sub­stan­tial com­mit­ments from th­ese par­tic­i­pants, and cov­ered ar­eas which are very dif­fi­cult to cover, like in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty. There was even con­tent on ex­change rates and things like that.</p>
    <p>The RCEP is a dif­fer­ent con­fig­u­ra­tion. It is Asian, it in­cludes all of the ma­jor Asian economies ex­cept In­dia, which un­for­tu­nately has de­cided not to be part of the group­ing. It cov­ers one-third of the global pop­u­la­tion and one-third of the world’s GDP (gross do­mes­tic prod­uct).</p>
    <p>But it does not go as deep. Nev­er­the­less, it is a sig­nif­i­cant step to­wards re­duc­ing trade bar­ri­ers and fa­cil­i­tat­ing trade be­tween th­ese economies. It is also a sig­nif­i­cant state­ment that in Asia, what­ever hap­pens in the broader world, we would like to pro­mote re­gional in­te­gra­tion and that we do be­lieve in a model of co­op­er­a­tion and win-win trade rather than go it alone and beg­gar thy neigh­bour. In th­ese trou­bled times, it is worth quite a lot.</p>
    <p>Mick­leth­wait One thing which wor­ries me about RCEP is if you look at, for in­stance, China’s treat­ment of Aus­tralian ex­porters at the mo­ment. It is pun­ish­ing Aus­tralian ex­ports for po­lit­i­cal rea­sons. Most peo­ple will look at that and say that is an in­fringe­ment of what a trade bloc is about. But un­der this for­mat, there are no tools for deal­ing with this. Do you think that is some­thing that may come in the fu­ture?</p>
    <p>PM Lee The way to deal with those kinds of is­sues is the WTO (World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion)... the WTO does have rules – what re­stric­tions you can im­pose, how you have to jus­tify them, how to ad­ju­di­cate them and ap­peal the ad­ju­di­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>I hope with a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion, the WTO will no longer be de­lib­er­ately pushed to one side, as has been the ex­plicit pol­icy of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Mick­leth­wait Sin­ga­pore has been one of the great suc­cesses of global trade. When you look at the world at the mo­ment, there is a pos­si­bil­ity of di­vi­sion into two In­ter­nets, there is a pos­si­bil­ity in the di­vi­sion into re­gional blocs with maybe things like RCEP be­com­ing a sort of more re­gional va­ri­ety... Do you worry about a global world be­com­ing a much more re­gional one?</p>
    <p>PM Lee Re­gional blocs are a pos­si­bil­ity, but I do not think it will split up all to­gether. Be­cause the tran­sPa­cific trade links and trans-At­lantic trade links are too sub­stan­tial to be cut off, and to di­vide us into two worlds or three worlds.</p>
    <p>The risk of bi­fur­ca­tion of tech­nol­ogy is there. In fact, it is not just a risk, it has al­ready hap­pened be­cause in China, you can­not get Google or Face­book or Twit­ter. They have their own equiv­a­lents.</p>
    <p>There are le­git­i­mate rea­sons why you may be con­cerned about the prove­nance and own­er­ship and con­trol of the tech­nol­ogy for vi­tal parts of your in­for­ma­tion in­fra­struc­ture, like the 5G sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Mick­leth­wait You have fi­nessed Huawei quite el­e­gantly as I re­mem­bered it by giv­ing them some ac­cess to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>PM Lee No, we did what we thought made sense for us. We have strin­gent se­cu­rity re­quire­ments and we stated them up­front. We in­vited the op­er­a­tors to bid. We did not rule any­body out. The op­er­a­tors made their own cal­cu­la­tions, and they de­cided whom they would part­ner with. It is up to them.</p>
    <p>Our at­ti­tude is who­ever’s sys­tem I buy, and it is not go­ing to be my sys­tem, be­cause I do not have a Sin­ga­pore 5G sys­tem, there could be vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties, there could be de­lib­er­ate vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties, and there cer­tainly will be in­trud­ers try­ing to come in even if there are no de­lib­er­ate vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties. Some in­trud­ers are bound to come in. There­fore, ab­so­lute se­cu­rity is not to be had. We have to be prac­ti­cal about it. We will do what we can, and we will use the sys­tems for the risks and pur­poses which suit them.</p>
    <p>If I re­ally have some­thing which I ab­so­lutely can­not risk com­pro­mis­ing or los­ing in­for­ma­tion about, then I have to find some other so­lu­tion. If I say I want ab­so­lute se­cu­rity, that is not to be had in this world.</p>
    <p>Mick­leth­wait</p>
    <p>Do you think (Covid-19) gives Bi­den an op­por­tu­nity to reach out to ar­eas like Asia... of bring­ing your re­gion back to Amer­ica?</p>
    <p>PM Lee I hope so. The chance is there, but he has many pri­or­i­ties and Asia is but one of them. In Europe, he has many pri­or­i­ties too – trade as well as Nato. With Rus­sia, he has is­sues to set­tle, and in the Mid­dle East. I think he has a full plate. I hope that it will be a new di­rec­tion for Amer­ica, but do not for­get that Mr Trump col­lected more votes than Barack Obama. He has not dis­ap­peared, nor the pres­sures which he rep­re­sented, they have not dis­ap­peared from Amer­ica’s body politic ei­ther.</p>
    <p>We all want to work to­gether with the US. We all want to work to­gether with other vi­brant economies. We would like to co­op­er­ate within the re­gion. I think not very many coun­tries would like to join a coali­tion against those who have been ex­cluded, chief of whom would be China. Not just Sin­ga­pore and not just in Asia, I think even in Europe there will be coun­tries who want to do busi­ness with China.</p>
    <p>Mick­leth­wait Con­versely, to the Chi­nese, does this also of­fer an op­por­tu­nity? If you look at th­ese big chal­lenges like Covid-19, cli­mate change, th­ese are things that hap­pen to all hu­man­ity. They of­fer a po­ten­tial bridge to open up a bet­ter relationsh­ip with Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>PM Lee I hope so. When Mr Trump was elected, some Chi­nese com­men­ta­tors, per­haps overly con­fi­dent of their as­cen­dance, thought that they saw a strate­gic op­por­tu­nity – that Amer­ica would now not have a co­her­ent po­si­tion in the world, and there­fore they had the field open to them, and that they could ex­pand their in­flu­ence in the world.</p>
    <p>I think that they have since dis­cov­ered that it is not re­ally that much to their ad­van­tage to have Amer­ica at sixes and sevens, and un­able to have a co­her­ent for­eign pol­icy vis-a-vis China and the rest of the world. It is bet­ter to have some­body there who may not fully agree with you, but un­der­stands his in­ter­est in a broad way and whom you can deal with.</p>
    <p>With Bi­den, maybe they will de­cide that they want a new try. I hope so. It is not easy to do this. You re­mem­ber when Mr Obama first came in and Hil­lary Clin­ton was his Sec­re­tary of State. She met (Rus­sian For­eign Min­is­ter) Sergey Lavrov and said pereza­gruzka (re­set). It did not suc­ceed in re­set­ting re­la­tions, be­cause both sides’ prin­ci­pal con­sid­er­a­tions are do­mes­tic ones. The driv­ing forces, the com­pul­sions, their pri­or­i­ties, are do­mes­tic ones. If you want the out­side world to be at peace, that is un­likely to drive your do­mes­tic pol­icy or cause you to ad­just your do­mes­tic at­ti­tudes to lead to a sta­ble in­ter­na­tional or­der. That is why you end up with mis­cal­cu­la­tions and all kinds of un­ex­pected de­vel­op­ments i n the world.</p>
