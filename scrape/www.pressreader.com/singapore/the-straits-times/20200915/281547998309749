    <p>Thirty re­cently re­trenched staff from the Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) Group have ap­plied for jobs at EtonHouse In­ter­na­tional Ed­u­ca­tion Group. If suc­cess­ful, they will take up about a third of the more than 100 po­si­tions on of­fer at the in­ter­na­tional school group. That is the num­ber of jobs the school com­mit­ted to of­fer last Fri­day to for­mer SIA staff who have been re­trenched.</p>
    <p>BE­ING A ROLE MODEL</p>
    <p>As a flight at­ten­dant, I have in­ter­acted with many peo­ple, and those that are po­lite and well-man­nered al­ways stand out. It mo­ti­vated me to nur­ture and model pos­i­tive be­hav­iour in young chil­dren, so that they can make a dif­fer­ence in their lives and that of oth­ers.</p>
    <p>FOR­MER LEAD­ING AIR STEWARDESS JOSEPHYNE HO, who is now a se­nior principal at EtonHouse Pre-School Mount­bat­ten 223.</p>
    <p>Thirty re­cently re­trenched staff from the Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) Group have ap­plied for jobs at EtonHouse In­ter­na­tional Ed­u­ca­tion Group.</p>
    <p>If suc­cess­ful, they will take up about a third of the more than 100 po­si­tions on of­fer at the in­ter­na­tional school group. That is the num­ber of jobs the school com­mit­ted to of­fer last Fri­day to for­mer SIA staff who have been re­trenched.</p>
    <p>EtonHouse is of­fer­ing two tracks to Sin­ga­porean ap­pli­cants – teach­ing and ad­min­is­tra­tive – and those hired will re­ceive a monthly salary of be­tween $2,000 and $3,000.</p>
    <p>The school’s ef­forts were cited yes­ter­day by Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Chan Chun Sing dur­ing a visit to semi­con­duc­tor firm AEM.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan had said com­pa­nies in the Scale-up SG pro­gramme, which in­cludes EtonHouse, have helped to cre­ate good job out­comes and op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans amid the bleak eco­nomic cli­mate.</p>
    <p>He said: “This is how we in­tend to help one an­other through these very dif­fi­cult times, with the Gov­ern­ment part­ner­ing our com­pa­nies, and our com­pa­nies part­ner­ing the unions, to see how we can place the dis­placed work­ers from one com­pany or one sec­tor to ad­ja­cent ones, so that they can con­tinue to pre­serve the hard-won ca­pa­bil­i­ties that we have built up over the years.”</p>
    <p>Mrs Ng Gim Choo, founder and man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of the EtonHouse Group, said: “I am a fre­quent traveller on Sin­ga­pore Air­lines and I have al­ways ad­mired the pro­fes­sion­al­ism of SIA staff and the high stan­dards of cus­tomer ser­vice and re­la­tion­ship build­ing that they rep­re­sent.</p>
    <p>“They also have a wealth of in­ter­na­tional ex­pe­ri­ence and cul­tural un­der­stand­ing that they bring to their roles.”</p>
    <p>Mrs Ng said she started the pro­gramme to “reach out to the won­der­ful SIA staff who may have lost their jobs and are look­ing for a mean­ing­ful ca­reer path”.</p>
    <p>She said: “As a part of this pro­gramme and pro­fes­sion, they can shape the lives of fu­ture gen­era</p>
    <p>tions. We also wish to play a part in sup­port­ing our so­ci­ety as we fight this dif­fi­cult pe­riod caused by the pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Un­der the two-year teach­ing track, can­di­dates will work part</p>
    <p>time in the schools as teach­ing as­sis­tants, while pur­su­ing an early child­hood qual­i­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>After start­ing off as teach­ing as­sis­tants, they can move up to be­come as­sis­tant teach­ers, and later take on</p>
    <p>more se­nior lead­er­ship po­si­tions, like ex­ec­u­tive principal.</p>
    <p>Those on the ad­min­is­tra­tive track can work in roles in­volv­ing par­ent li­ai­son, school man­age­ment or roles in the head of­fice, such as busi­ness de­vel­op­ment, com­mu­ni­ca­tions or mar­ket­ing.</p>
    <p>Op­por­tu­ni­ties for over­seas post­ings in se­nior po­si­tions are also avail­able. EtonHouse has more than 120 schools in 12 coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The group has in the past also hired for­mer SIA staff who are now prin­ci­pals, teach­ers, par­ent li­ai­son ex­ec­u­tives, or work­ing in busi­ness de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>One of them is for­mer lead­ing air stewardess Josephyne Ho, 50, who in 2003 made the switch to teach­ing at EtonHouse after a decade with SIA. She is now a se­nior principal at EtonHouse Pre-School Mount­bat­ten 223.</p>
    <p>She said: “As a flight at­ten­dant, I have in­ter­acted with many peo­ple, and those that are po­lite and well­man­nered al­ways stand out. It mo­ti­vated me to nur­ture and model pos­i­tive be­hav­iour in young chil­dren, so that they can make a dif­fer­ence in their lives and that of oth­ers.</p>
    <p>“For ev­ery­thing that I lacked in terms of teach­ing, I made it up with de­ter­mi­na­tion, knowl­edge and more knowl­edge.”</p>
