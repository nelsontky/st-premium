    <p>Mr Kuok Khoon Hong is ready to pull off a re­mark­able sec­ond act. The bil­lion­aire sold shares of his China busi­ness in the big­gest ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO) on the Shen­zhen Stock Ex­change, thanks to the most pop­u­lar cook­ing oil brand in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Mr Kuok’s Yi­hai Kerry Arawana Hold­ings de­buted on the tech­heavy ChiNext yes­ter­day after its IPO raised 13.9 bil­lion yuan (S$2.8 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>Its name­sake cook­ing oil with a Golden Dragon Fish logo has been a sta­ple of Chi­nese kitchens for decades, and fu­elled de­mand 3,499 times the amount of shares of­fered to re­tail in­vestors on­line.</p>
    <p>After start­ing pro­duc­tion i n 1991 from the main­land’s first packed oil pro­duc­tion line, the unit of Mr Kuok’s Wil­mar In­ter­na­tional now has 40 per cent of a Chi­nese ed­i­ble oil market that con­sumes al­most 40 mil­lion tonnes an­nu­ally.</p>
    <p>The IPO comes just three years after the coun­try opened doors for for­eign firms to in­vest in the oilseed crush­ing sec­tor, al­low­ing global names such as Bunge and Cargill to take on lo­cal ri­vals, in­clud­ing Arawana and state-run Cofco Corp.</p>
    <p>“Yi­hai Kerry Arawana has tremen­dous con­trol­ling power in its own market, with a solid sales per­for­mance even dur­ing the lock­down pe­riod of the coro­n­avirus,” said Bei­jing-based an­a­lyst Wang Ling of Si­no­link Se­cu­ri­ties.</p>
    <p>Arawana’s shares closed up 117.5 per cent yes­ter­day at 56 yuan, com­pared with the IPO price of 25.70 yuan.</p>
    <p>The share sale sur­passed CGN Power’s 12.6 bil­lion yuan list­ing last year to be the largest IPO in Shen­zhen, ac­cord­ing to data com­piled by Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>Mr Kuok’s IPO of Arawana fol­lows his suc­cess i n turn­ing Wil­mar, with an­nual rev­enue of more than US$40 bil­lion (S$54.4 bil­lion), into the world’s big­gest palm oil busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Shares of the Sin­ga­pore-based com­modi­ties gi­ant have risen 13 per cent so far this year, but tum­bled 6.44 per cent to close at $4.36 yes­ter­day. Archer-Daniel­sMid­land Co owns more than 20 per cent of Wil­mar.</p>
    <p>Arawana pitched the IPO as a re­flec­tion of its po­si­tion in China and a bet on the coun­try’s fu­ture, it said in a state­ment on its web­site last month.</p>
    <p>The com­pany had rev­enue of 171 bil­lion yuan last year with net in­come of 5.56 bil­lion yuan, ac­cord­ing to an ex­change fil­ing.</p>
    <p>The IPO ap­pealed to the main­land’s in­di­vid­ual re­tail­ers with a prom­ise to share prof­its with the Chi­nese peo­ple and con­trib­ute to the econ­omy of its home­land.</p>
    <p>The world’s sec­ond-largest stock market has added US$3.3 tril­lion since a low in March, helped by gov­ern­ment poli­cies to en­cour­age trad­ing, a flurry of new list­ings and the strength­en­ing ren­minbi.</p>
    <p>Mr Huang Xiong, a 53-year-old from Shang­hai, snared an al­lo­ca­tion of shares in the IPO and said he was drawn by Arawana’s strong po­si­tion in the cook­ing oil market.</p>
    <p>“The prod­uct is meet­ing de­mand for some­thing that all homes must con­sume on a daily ba­sis in China,” Mr Huang said in a tele­phone in­ter­view. “Arawana has been in a dom­i­nant po­si­tion here as a brand ev­ery­body knows for many years.”</p>
    <p>Yi­hai Kerry Arawana op­er­ates more than 70 pro­duc­tion bases in China, pro­duc­ing cook­ing oil, rice, flour, dairy and other in­gre­di­ents. It has said the IPO pro­ceeds will be used on 19 food pro­duc­tion projects in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>In its lat­est ex­pan­sion, Arawana will in­vest 10 bil­lion yuan to build the largest food com­plex in Jiangsu’s Lusi port.</p>
