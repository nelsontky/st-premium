    <p>The for­mer Big Box shop­ping mall in Jurong East has been ac­quired by Peren­nial Real Es­tate Hold­ings for $118 mil­lion, said the de­vel­oper yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>More than $70 mil­lion is ex­pected to be in­vested to re­de­velop the site into a busi­ness park, said the com­pany, which has ob­tained JTC Cor­po­ra­tion’s con­fir­ma­tion for the zon­ing of the site to be changed.</p>
    <p>The prop­erty is lo­cated in the Jurong Lake Dis­trict, which is slated to be­come Sin­ga­pore’s largest com­mer­cial and re­gional cen­tre out­side of the city cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Re­de­vel­op­ment will be com­pleted pro­gres­sively from the fourth quar­ter next year, with the prop­erty be­ing re­named Peren­nial Busi­ness City.</p>
    <p>With a land area of ap­prox­i­mately 606,600 sq ft, the for­mer mall’s spa­ces are pre­dom­i­nantly de­signed for ware­hous­ing and ware­house re­tail us­age.</p>
    <p>It is linked to sur­round­ing build­ings such as Jem and IMM and has a shel­tered con­nec­tion to Jurong East MRT sta­tion.</p>
    <p>It is ac­ces­si­ble via ma­jor ex­press­ways, in­clud­ing Ayer Ra­jah Ex­press­way, Pan-Is­land Ex­press­way, and the Tuas Sec­ond Link.</p>
    <p>“The prop­erty is also di­rectly linked... to Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral Hospi­tal and Jurong Com­mu­nity Hospi­tal, which will com­ple­ment its po­ten­tial biomedical sciences and health ten­ants,” Peren­nial said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>It plans to in­crease the prop­erty’s gross floor area from 1.4 mil­lion sq ft to 1.5 mil­lion sq ft, and the net let­table area from 1 mil­lion sq ft to 1.1 mil­lion sq ft.</p>
    <p>The new de­vel­op­ment will fea­ture large floor plates, am­ple carpark spa­ces and a large rooftop gar­den with an am­phithe­atre.</p>
    <p>Peren­nial will own a ma­jor­ity 51 per cent stake in the fu­ture busi­ness park. The re­main­ing stake will be held by other in­vestors, such as HPRY Hold­ings, which is the in­vest­ment ve­hi­cle of Peren­nial di­rec­tor Kuok Khoon Hong.</p>
    <p>The trans­ac­tion is ex­pected to be com­plete by mid-February next year.</p>
    <p>The de­vel­oper has ap­pointed CBRE Sin­ga­pore to kick-start mar­ket­ing and leas­ing to po­ten­tial ten­ants from in­dus­tries such as in­fo­comm tech­nol­ogy and biomedical sciences, and fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>Peren­nial chief ex­ec­u­tive Pua Seck Guan said the ac­qui­si­tion was a “ma­jor mile­stone” for ex­pand­ing the com­pany’s real es­tate port­fo­lio to in­clude busi­ness parks.</p>
    <p>“With its strate­gic lo­ca­tion, ex­cel­lent trans­port con­nec­tiv­ity, close prox­im­ity to ameni­ties and in­no­va­tive de­sign to sup­port ur­ban sus­tain­abil­ity and healthy well-be­ing, Peren­nial Busi­ness City is well poised to cater to local and re­gional busi­nesses geared for the fu­ture econ­omy,” he said.</p>
