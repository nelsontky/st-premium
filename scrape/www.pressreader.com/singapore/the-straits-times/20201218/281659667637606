    <p>Non-res­i­dents took the big­gest hit when the job mar­ket went off the rails dur­ing the pan­demic, said a new re­port, which also noted that va­can­cies shot up in Septem­ber – the first rise all year.</p>
    <p>It found that the to­tal num­ber of peo­ple work­ing, ex­clud­ing for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers, fell by 158,700 from Jan­uary to the end of Septem­ber. Non-res­i­dents made up 139,100 of this, while res­i­dent em­ploy­ment shrank by just 19,600, the Min­istry of Man­power re­port said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In the third quar­ter alone, non­res­i­dent em­ploy­ment de­clines were most ev­i­dent in con­struc­tion, man­u­fac­tur­ing, trans­porta­tion and stor­age, and ad­min­is­tra­tive and sup­port ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents lost jobs in the arts, en­ter­tain­ment and recre­ation sec­tor but took on more po­si­tions in pub­lic ad­min­is­tra­tion and ed­u­ca­tion, health and so­cial ser­vices, and in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>There was also a re­bound in food and bev­er­age ser­vices, re­vers­ing two straight quar­ters of de­cline.</p>
    <p>These ten­ta­tive steps for­ward are re­flected in an in­crease in job open­ings for the first time this tu­mul­tuous year.</p>
    <p>There were 49,600 job va­can­cies in Septem­ber, sea­son­ally ad­justed, a huge im­prove­ment from the decade-low of 42,400 in June.</p>
    <p>This lifted the ra­tio of job va­can­cies to un­em­ployed peo­ple from 0.57 in June to 0.6 in Septem­ber, mean­ing there were six job open­ings for ev­ery 10 job seek­ers.</p>
    <p>There was an in­crease in po­si­tions for pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs) in sec­tors like in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions, pro­fes­sional ser­vices, and health and so­cial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Non-PMET po­si­tions opened up in sec­tors such as con­struc­tion, ad­min­is­tra­tive and sup­port ser­vices, and man­u­fac­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>National Trades Union Con­gress as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Pa­trick Tay said in a Face­book post: “Nev­er­the­less, our PMEs ... con­tinue to be a group that we must pay at­ten­tion to. They are a vul­ner­a­ble group with greater fi­nan­cial bur­dens and at risk of stag­nant skills and ca­reer growth.</p>
    <p>“As Covid-19 ac­cel­er­ates busi­ness trans­for­ma­tion, work­ers in­clud­ing PMEs must con­tinue to up­skill and reskill to... move on from the pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Labour turnover also rose, with re­cruit­ment and res­ig­na­tion rates go­ing up in the third quar­ter to 1.6 per cent, sea­son­ally ad­justed. This is in line with the grad­ual re­sump­tion in hir­ing and vol­un­tary job change as labour mar­ket ac­tiv­ity picked up, the MOM said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, labour turnover re­mained muted com­pared with a year ago, it noted.</p>
    <p>As ac­tiv­ity picked up, the num­ber of work­ers placed on short work­ing weeks or tem­po­rary lay­offs in the third quar­ter fell to 34,240, from about 81,000 in the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dent long-term un­em­ploy­ment rose marginally in Septem­ber, af­ter dip­ping in June.</p>
    <p>De­spite the in­crease in labour mar­ket ac­tiv­ity, im­prove­ment re­mains un­even across the var­i­ous sec­tors, the MOM added.</p>
    <p>Sec­tors where re­mote work is more likely showed the most im­prove­ment, as well as those that are con­sumer-fac­ing and ben­e­fited from the exit from the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>These in­clude pub­lic ad­min­is­tra­tion and ed­u­ca­tion, food and bev­er­age ser­vices, and in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Tourism-de­pen­dent in­dus­tries, in­clud­ing ac­com­mo­da­tion, trans­porta­tion and stor­age, and arts, en­ter­tain­ment and recre­ation, con­tin­ued to strug­gle amid the pan­demic.</p>
