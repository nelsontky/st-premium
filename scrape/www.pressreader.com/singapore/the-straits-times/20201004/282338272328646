    <p>Fu­rama River­Front’s Wa­ter­fall lounge has been draw­ing a steady stream of home of­fice es­capees since its launch – and for good rea­son.</p>
    <p>The ho­tel de­clined to re­veal the num­ber of seats avail­able and the take-up rate.</p>
    <p>How­ever, all 70 or so seats at the Wa­ter­fall lounge were full by 10am when The Sun­day Times vis­ited on a week­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>More seats are avail­able at ho­tel restau­rants The Square and Kin­ta­mani on lev­els two and three, though these make a less pretty Zoom back­drop.</p>
    <p>Since Mon­day, the ho­tel has raised prices from $15 to $28 for a day pass, which may ease de­mand.</p>
    <p>OF­FICE FOR THE DAY</p>
    <p>Re­fur­bished last year, the space feels plush yet youth­ful, like hang­ing out at a trendy friend’s crib.</p>
    <p>Full-length glass pan­els let in an abun­dance of nat­u­ral light and views of green­ery (right). Suede couches, mar­bled table­tops and rat­tan wall decor lend a mod­ern back­drop to Zoom calls.</p>
    <p>Plush couches and cof­fee ta­bles are comfy for loung­ing – I even spot one per­son tak­ing a nap.</p>
    <p>To get se­ri­ous work done, charge for the rat­tan chairs with ta­bles of a reg­u­lar height, though even these feel like a game of Tetris as I bal­ance two lap­tops, pots of tea and lunch. Ta­bles at</p>
    <p>The Square and Kin­ta­mani have more room.</p>
    <p>Power sock­ets are avail­able at most ta­bles, even those in the mid­dle of the lounge. Although my com­pan­ion had prob­lems with the Wi-Fi con­nec­tion at first, staff were quick to trou­bleshoot.</p>
    <p>My Zoom call went off with­out a hitch and those who want to watch Net­flix will have no trou­ble ei­ther.</p>
    <p>A mix of work­ing pro­fes­sion­als and a back­pack-tot­ing, hoodie-wear­ing crowd gives the place a vague school-li­brary feel, com­plete with an air of hushed fo­cus.</p>
    <p>Meet­ings and phone calls go on qui­etly, and pa­trons are gen­er­ally con­sid­er­ate.</p>
    <p>FEEL­ING PECK­ISH?</p>
    <p>Be­sides free-flow cof­fee, tea, juices and soft drinks for the pass holder and one guest, lounge passes come with $15 din­ing credit.</p>
    <p>This can be used for an ex­ten­sive menu that in­cludes pizza and burg­ers, Asian food from Kin­ta­mani, and cakes.</p>
    <p>Set lunches – at $9.80 for mains such as salted egg prawn rice, ba­con aglio olio and a smoked sal­mon bagel – are good value. Or­der­ing via an on­line chat­bot is fuss-free.</p>
    <p>A snack cart stocked with treats, such as ice cream from Ud­ders and salted egg yolk fish skin from Irvin’s, will keep the mid­day munchies at bay.</p>
    <p>PERKS</p>
    <p>Be­sides free park­ing and a concierge to take care of print­ing and mail, each pass grants one child free week­day ad­mis­sion to the ho­tel’s i ndoor play­ground Waka Waka, which usu­ally costs $18 on weekdays.</p>
