    <p>Buy­ing prop­erty can be daunt­ing, given fac­tors like price, lo­ca­tion and ameni­ties to con­sider, but Knight Frank ex­ec­u­tive Linda Ch­ern ap­proaches the task with slide-rule pre­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>She has de­vised her for­mula over many years of real es­tate ex­pe­ri­ence and ap­plies it with a keen eye.</p>
    <p>A prop­erty should have pri­mary schools within 1km to 2km, an MRT sta­tion within a 10-minute walk, and shop­ping malls or su­per­mar­kets no more than 10 min­utes by car.</p>
    <p>High ceil­ings and a north-south ori­en­ta­tion do not hurt, ei­ther.</p>
    <p>She adds: “It would be ideal if there are restau­rants and clin­ics in the vicin­ity as well.</p>
    <p>“Apart from that, prox­im­ity to parks and other sports fa­cil­i­ties is a fur­ther plus point.”</p>
    <p>If the prop­erty is for rental, she favours the Cen­tral Busi­ness District as the yields tend to be good and ten­ants easy to find.</p>
    <p>Ms Ch­ern, 50, who has over two decades of ex­pe­ri­ence in real es­tate, is the head of res­i­den­tial pro­ject mar­ket­ing and prime sales and leas­ing at Knight Frank Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>She holds a diploma in mar­ket­ing from MDIS and started her ca­reer in fi­nan­cial ad­vi­sory.</p>
    <p>Ms Ch­ern also ad­vises home seek­ers to do the usual checks on val­u­a­tions, fi­nanc­ing and in­ter­est rates be­fore jump­ing into the mar­ket, adding that it is also ideal to buy mort­gage in­sur­ance to pro­vide se­cu­rity for loved ones in case of death or per­ma­nent dis­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>She and her 51-year-old busi­ness­man hus­band have two chil­dren, aged 17 and 20.</p>
    <p>They pre­vi­ously owned a unit at Hol­land Hill Man­sion, which went en bloc in 2008, reap­ing them a profit of $1.5 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Now, they live in a con­do­minium unit at Cairn­hill Plaza near New­ton, bought in 2015 for $3.8 mil­lion. The 2,852 sq ft prop­erty has three en-suite bed­rooms.</p>
    <p>Ms Ch­ern says: “We wanted a spa­cious, lat­eral or sin­gle-level apart­ment and were look­ing around for a pe­riod of time.</p>
    <p>“Most apart­ments we saw had big bal­conies, bay win­dows or ter­races, which we were not keen on.”</p>
    <p>Her favourite part of the home is the liv­ing room, which is bright and of­fers a sun­set view.</p>
    <p>She also chose the unit be­cause it is spa­cious enough to ac­com­mo­date her grow­ing chil­dren and meets her key re­quire­ments – prox­im­ity to ameni­ties like the MRT sta­tion and malls.</p>
    <p>Q What are the fac­tors you look out for when buy­ing prop­erty?</p>
    <p>A I look at the de­vel­oper, the prop­erty’s util­i­sa­tion of space, prox­im­ity to ameni­ties, where the unit faces and the price per square foot (psf).</p>
    <p>The rep­u­ta­tion and track record of the de­vel­oper are im­por­tant as they add to the buyer’s con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>They as­sure me of the qual­ity of the prop­erty I’ll be liv­ing in, and in­spire con­fi­dence when it comes to the fin­ish­ings, which hope­fully means fewer main­te­nance is­sues.</p>
    <p>A well-built prop­erty with a good lay­out and fa­cil­i­ties also lets me get a bet­ter ask­ing price from ten­ants should I de­cide to rent it out.</p>
    <p>As for an ideal size, I see it as re­lat­ing to the amount of in­te­rior liv­ing space that my fam­ily and I can en­joy.</p>
    <p>Ideal units are not only reg­u­lar in shape, but also do not have too many bal­conies, ter­races, bay win­dows or air-con­di­tion­ing ledges.</p>
    <p>High ceil­ings are great as they make the prop­erty look brighter and more spa­cious.</p>
    <p>Good-fac­ing units are those that of­fer views of green­ery or have open views and do not cap­ture the noon sun.</p>
    <p>I also pre­fer those that are north­south fac­ing, which I reckon have bet­ter cross ven­ti­la­tion.</p>
    <p>As for the ideal price per square foot, there is no fixed an­swer to this. It de­pends on the lo­ca­tion and the kind of devel­op­ment that I’m look­ing for at the time.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, older projects tend to have a more at­trac­tive price psf com­pared with new launches.</p>
    <p>At the same time, older de­vel­op­ments may have their down­sides due to wear and tear.</p>
    <p>I feel renovation work will cost a lot more than be­fore as a re­sult of the pan­demic, so more buy­ers may move to­wards newer prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>There are new projects that have huge po­ten­tial for growth and pro­vide de­cent rental yields, de­pend­ing on lo­ca­tion and type.</p>
    <p>Q Are you plan­ning to buy prop­erty in the next three to five years?</p>
    <p>A I’m plan­ning to sell my cur­rent prop­erty and pur­chase two smaller units – one for my own oc­cu­pa­tion and one as an in­vest­ment for rental in­come.</p>
    <p>My pref­er­ence would be to own a three-bed­room prop­erty for my oc­cu­pa­tion and ei­ther a two- or three-bed­room unit for rental in­come.</p>
    <p>I will want to in­volve my hus­band and chil­dren in the process of de­cid­ing which prop­erty we want to live in to­gether as a fam­ily. My fam­ily must feel com­fort­able in the place they call home.</p>
    <p>Q How did you get into prop­erty in­vest­ment?</p>
    <p>A I have been in the real es­tate in­dus­try for 23 years and have a pas­sion for prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>In 1999, we bought a three-bed­room apart­ment that spanned 1,216 sq ft in the River Val­ley vicin­ity, which we sold when I was preg­nant with my se­cond child as we needed more space.</p>
    <p>In 2003, we bought a 1,927 sq ft con­do­minium unit in Hol­land Hill Man­sion, which went en bloc and gave us some prof­its.</p>
    <p>That ex­er­cise then spurred me to look more closely at prop­er­ties with po­ten­tial for col­lec­tive sale and cap­i­tal ap­pre­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Now, with my job, the sat­is­fac­tion comes when I help clients find their dream homes or when I help to sell their prop­er­ties at a good price. That keeps me go­ing.</p>
    <p>I love look­ing at prop­er­ties, es­pe­cially their ar­chi­tec­ture and de­sign. Each one is unique and tells you so much about the owner, as well as the ar­chi­tect.</p>
    <p>Q What are the chal­lenges peo­ple usu­ally face when buy­ing or in­vest­ing in prop­erty?</p>
    <p>A Price is def­i­nitely a fac­tor. Some­times a choice home may be out of reach due to bud­get con­straints.</p>
    <p>When in­vest­ing in prop­erty, there is also the ten­dency for some to rely on herd in­stinct or hearsay.</p>
    <p>My ad­vice is al­ways to take a lit­tle time to re­search the lo­ca­tion and the prices trans­acted in the area.</p>
    <p>Comb the area and find out the prop­erty’s prox­im­ity to ameni­ties and its po­ten­tial cap­i­tal ap­pre­ci­a­tion in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Q What’s your view of the prop­erty mar­ket?</p>
    <p>A The Sin­ga­pore prop­erty mar­ket is re­silient. De­spite the on­go­ing pan­demic, prop­erty prices and trans­ac­tions have re­mained ro­bust.</p>
    <p>In­vestors and high-net-worth in­di­vid­u­als are at­tracted to Sin­ga­pore’s safety, world-class in­fra­struc­ture, ed­u­ca­tion and pro-busi­ness Govern­ment.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, prime res­i­den­tial prop­er­ties have shown to be re­silient against down­ward pres­sure from the ex­ter­nal en­vi­ron­ment, mak­ing them ideal as­sets for wealth preser­va­tion.</p>
    <p>As more peo­ple work from home, the search has now widened to in­clude prop­er­ties near parks or open spa­ces, homes with a study, or big­ger apart­ments with a good­sized kitchen.</p>
    <p>Q What other in­stru­ments do you in­vest in and what is your over­all strat­egy?</p>
    <p>A Even though prop­er­ties oc­cupy a size­able por­tion of my in­vest­ment al­lo­ca­tion, I di­ver­sify with for­eign ex­change, shares and bonds to pro­vide my­self with some room for liq­uid­ity and to spread out my ex­po­sure to mar­ket risks.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­vest­ments are usu­ally across a num­ber of in­dus­tries that are a mix of low- to mid-level risks.</p>
    <p>Other than look­ing at fi­nan­cial re­turns, I think we should not for­get to in­vest in our health and per­sonal well-be­ing as well.</p>
    <p>Q What are your top tips to buy­ers dur­ing this un­cer­tain time?</p>
    <p>A Although the mar­ket is ro­bust, I would ad­vise buy­ers to ex­er­cise re­straint in their prop­erty pur­chase.</p>
    <p>It will be pru­dent to look at the Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund amounts they have and their loan el­i­gi­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Pur­chas­ing within their bud­get is im­por­tant so they can meet their monthly mort­gage com­mit­ments and have enough funds to tide over an emer­gency.</p>
    <p>Prior to the pur­chase, it will be wise to run through the num­bers with an ex­pe­ri­enced mort­gage banker or bro­ker.</p>
    <p>They should also check out the in­ter­est rates be­ing of­fered by the var­i­ous banks.</p>
    <p>An in­dica­tive val­u­a­tion of the prop­erty should also be done, so as to buy at a rea­son­able price.</p>
    <p>Q My dream home is ...</p>
    <p>A An apart­ment in the Ard­more area. It has great prox­im­ity to Or­chard Road and its ameni­ties, yet is still away from the hus­tle and bus­tle of it all.</p>
