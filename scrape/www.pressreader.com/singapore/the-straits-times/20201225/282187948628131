    <p>A man flew i nto a rage and punched his es­tranged wife in front of the vice-prin­ci­pals of their chil­dren’s pri­mary school fol­low­ing a do­mes­tic dis­pute.</p>
    <p>The two vice-prin­ci­pals and a school coun­sel­lor had to in­ter­vene be­fore the wife called for po­lice as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>The of­fender was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to eight years, six months and three weeks’ jail af­ter plead­ing guilty to an as­sault charge and three drug-re­lated of­fences.</p>
    <p>The 43-year-old Sin­ga­porean was also or­dered to re­ceive six strokes of the cane.</p>
    <p>Nine other charges, mainly for drug-re­lated of­fences, were con­sid­ered dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>De­tails about the cou­ple and the school can­not be re­vealed to pro­tect the iden­ti­ties of the two chil­dren – a nine-year-old girl and a 12-year-old boy.</p>
    <p>The court heard that in June 2017, the man grabbed his daugh­ter as he wanted to throw her from the 10th storey of a block of flats. It was not dis­closed why he acted in such a man­ner.</p>
    <p>On July 1 last year, he went to the school with two of his si­b­lings to look for his chil­dren. He was sep­a­rated from his wife and in the midst of di­vorce pro­ceed­ings at the time.</p>
    <p>Their daugh­ter told a school coun­sel­lor that she did not want to meet her fa­ther. A vice-prin­ci­pal called the man’s wife around noon to tell her about the sit­u­a­tion. The woman told the school not to al­low the man to see their chil­dren.</p>
    <p>She ar­rived at the school soon af­ter to meet her hus­band in the prin­ci­pal’s of­fice. The vice-prin­ci­pals and the coun­sel­lor were also present to fa­cil­i­tate the meet­ing.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Zhou Yi­hong said: “Dur­ing the con­ver­sa­tion, the vic­tim men­tioned that the ac­cused had not con­trib­uted any­thing for their chil­dren, and brought up a past in­ci­dent in­volv­ing the ac­cused want­ing to throw their daugh­ter down from the 10th floor.</p>
    <p>“In re­sponse, the ac­cused be­came ag­i­tated. He stood up, lurched for­ward to­wards the vic­tim and... punched the vic­tim on the right side of her head.”</p>
    <p>The school staff in­ter­vened and the woman later went to Wood­lands Poly­clinic where she was found to be suf­fer­ing from ten­der­ness to her scalp.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, the man ad­mit­ted in court that he had con­sumed drugs in­clud­ing metham­phetamine in April and June this year.</p>
    <p>For as­sault, he could have been jailed for up to two years and fined up to $5,000. For metham­phetamine con­sump­tion, he could have been jailed for up to 13 years and given up to 12 strokes of the cane.</p>
