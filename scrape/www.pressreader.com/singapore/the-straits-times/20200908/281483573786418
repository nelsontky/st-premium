    <p>The Au­di­tor-Gen­eral’s Of­fice (AGO) has flagged weak­nesses in IT con­trols as well as lapses in pro­cure­ment, con­tract and op­er­a­tions man­age­ment in its an­nual au­dit report re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It high­lighted is­sues in three min­istries and eight statu­tory boards, in­clud­ing IT weak­nesses at na­tional wa­ter agency PUB and gaps in the man­age­ment of busi­ness grant pro­grammes un­der Work­force Sin­ga­pore and En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In its re­sponse to the report, the Min­istry of Fi­nance said pub­lic ac­count­abil­ity re­mains a top pri­or­ity for the Gov­ern­ment, which will con­tinue to strengthen pro­cure­ment and con­tract man­age­ment pro­cesses, as well as tighten its IT au­dit­ing regime.</p>
    <p>De­fi­cien­cies in IT con­trols con­tinue to be a point of con­cern for a num­ber of gov­ern­ment agen­cies, and au­dits have turned up lapses in pro­cure­ment, con­tract and op­er­a­tions man­age­ment at en­ti­ties such as the JTC Cor­po­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>In its an­nual au­dit report re­leased yes­ter­day, the Au­di­tor-Gen­eral’s Of­fice (AGO) flagged is­sues in three min­istries and eight statu­tory boards.</p>
    <p>These in­clude IT weak­nesses at na­tional wa­ter agency PUB, as well as gaps in the man­age­ment of busi­ness grant pro­grammes un­der Work­force Sin­ga­pore (WSG) and En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG).</p>
    <p>Pub­lic ac­count­abil­ity re­mains a top pri­or­ity for the Gov­ern­ment, the Fi­nance Min­istry said in its re­sponse to the report.</p>
    <p>“Heads of the agen­cies con­cerned have re­viewed each case and are tak­ing ac­tive steps to ad­dress the lapses. Where rel­e­vant, re­me­dial ac­tions have been taken at a wholeof-gov­ern­ment level to pre­vent re­cur­rence of these lapses.”</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment agen­cies have ver­i­fied that no con­fi­den­tial data was com­pro­mised and no unau­tho­rised ac­tiv­i­ties re­sulted from the IT lapses, and that they have taken steps to ad­dress lapses in­volv­ing over­pay­ments, the min­istry added.</p>
    <p>This year’s report was de­layed due to Covid-19 mea­sures, in­clud­ing the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, said Au­di­tor-Gen­eral Goh Soon Poh. These af­fected the time­line for the prepa­ra­tion of the gov­ern­ment fi­nan­cial state­ments and con­se­quently, the com­ple­tion of the au­dit by AGO. The report is typ­i­cally is­sued in July.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral IT is­sues in­volved the most priv­i­leged op­er­at­ing sys­tem user ac­counts, said Ms Goh.</p>
    <p>These ac­counts give users full ac­cess priv­i­leges to the op­er­at­ing sys­tem, in­clud­ing the abil­ity to make changes to ac­tiv­ity logs. For this rea­son, it is con­sid­ered pru­dent to re­strict ac­cess to such ac­counts and re­view all ac­tiv­i­ties car­ried out with them.</p>
    <p>But in some or­gan­i­sa­tions, mis­con­fig­u­ra­tions led to op­er­at­ing sys­tem ad­min­is­tra­tors be­ing able to ac­cess these ac­counts with­out pass­word au­then­ti­ca­tion. Oth­ers did not carry out ad­e­quate ac­tiv­ity re­views.</p>
    <p>In the case of PUB, which was in­volved in a pub­lic-pri­vate part­ner­ship project, it did not en­sure that its pri­vate sec­tor part­ner had im­ple­mented ad­e­quate con­trols. For ex­am­ple, ex­ces­sive rights were granted to the part­ner’s ven­dor. An ad­min­is­tra­tor ac­count was also shared among staff from the part­ner and its ven­dor.</p>
    <p>Lapses in pro­cure­ment and con­tract man­age­ment were found at the Gov­ern­ment Tech­nol­ogy Agency, JTC, Na­tional Li­brary Board (NLB) and PUB.</p>
    <p>NLB was found to have poorly man­aged con­tract vari­a­tions and over­all project man­age­ment for its re­vamp of the Na­tional Ar­chives of Sin­ga­pore build­ing. In-prin­ci­ple ap­provals were sought for vari­a­tions with­out com­pelling rea­sons, and ap­proved even though no ball­park cost es­ti­mates were pro­vided.</p>
    <p>In the end, the project ex­ceeded its ap­proved cost by $1.72 mil­lion, the Au­di­tor-Gen­eral noted.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, JTC paid a ter­mi­nated con­trac­tor, even though it could have with­held the pay­ment un­der the con­tract and used this to off­set the debt claimable from the con­trac­tor. JTC sub­se­quently filed a claim against the con­trac­tor for this debt, but as of June, had not yet re­ceived any monies owed.</p>
    <p>Lapses in op­er­a­tional pro­cesses were found at the Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs (MFA), JTC and PUB.</p>
    <p>In MFA’s case, the AGO de­tected is­sues when au­dit­ing an overseas mis­sion. Mea­sures to en­force terms stip­u­lated in ser­vice agree­ments signed with the mis­sion’s au­tho­rised visa agents were in­ad­e­quate, it said. Three of the 16 ap­pointed visa agents were found to have stated visa fees be­tween 16 per cent and 50 per cent higher than what was stip­u­lated in the ser­vice agree­ments.</p>
    <p>The AGO found that JTC’s leased and ten­anted premises may have been sub­let to about 26,000 en­ti­ties with­out ap­proval. It also noted il­le­gal stor­age or sale of diesel to the pub­lic at four leased in­dus­trial premises, which could pose en­vi­ron­men­tal and safety risks. Fol­low­ing this, JTC in­ves­ti­gated around 2,800 en­ti­ties, find­ing about 2,010 sus­pected cases of unau­tho­rised sub­let­ting.</p>
    <p>At PUB, the agency’s pri­vate sec­tor part­ner in a project was able to mod­ify real-time pa­ram­e­ters in an IT sys­tem, which would af­fect the amounts to be paid by PUB.</p>
    <p>In its au­dit of six busi­ness grant pro­grammes man­aged by WSG and ESG, the AGO flagged sev­eral is­sues with grant eval­u­a­tion and ap­proval, as well as with dis­burse­ment and ces­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, it noted three cases where in­di­vid­u­als or com­pa­nies may have cir­cum­vented WSG grant re­quire­ments and con­trols. It also found in­stances of dou­ble claims by com­pa­nies, and cases of dou­ble fund­ing across dif­fer­ent grants. In ad­di­tion, there were in­stances where WSG did not fol­low up to re­cover unutilised grant money in a timely man­ner.</p>
    <p>In the case of ESG, the funds dis­bursed for cer­tain grants were not in line with grant guide­lines, re­sult­ing in ei­ther an ex­cess or a short­fall. Its of­fi­cers also had in­con­sis­tent prac­tices when assess­ing com­pa­nies’ el­i­gi­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Fi­nance said the Gov­ern­ment will con­tinue to strengthen pro­cure­ment and con­tract man­age­ment pro­cesses, and is tight­en­ing its whole-of-gov­ern­ment IT au­dit­ing regime along­side the train­ing of pub­lic of­fi­cers on IT gov­er­nance and se­cu­rity con­trols.</p>
    <p>RE­ME­DIAL AC­TION TAKEN</p>
    <p>Heads of the agen­cies con­cerned have re­viewed each case and are tak­ing ac­tive steps to ad­dress the lapses. Where rel­e­vant, re­me­dial ac­tions have been taken at a whole-of-gov­ern­ment level to pre­vent re­cur­rence of these lapses.</p>
