    <p>Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and Mul­ti­me­dia Min­is­ter Sai­fud­din Ab­dul­lah said yes­ter­day that the Malaysian gov­ern­ment has no in­ten­tion of sti­fling peo­ple from post­ing per­sonal videos on so­cial me­dia, walk­ing back an as­ser­tion that raised a storm in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>His min­istry had ini­ti­ated a probe against broad­caster Al Jazeera for air­ing a con­tro­ver­sial doc­u­men­tary on un­doc­u­mented mi­grants in Malaysia, say­ing the Qatari tele­vi­sion news chan­nel filmed it with­out ob­tain­ing a li­cence from Malaysia’s Na­tional Film De­vel­op­ment Cor­po­ra­tion (Fi­nas).</p>
    <p>Re­ply­ing to a ques­tion in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day from an op­po­si­tion MP, he said all in­di­vid­u­als are re­quired by law to have a li­cence for film­ing ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>It raised the ques­tion of whether those in Malaysia are break­ing the law every time they post videos on YouTube, TikTok, Face­book Live and other so­cial me­dia plat­forms.</p>
    <p>“The rule ap­plies to ev­ery­one, be it main­stream me­dia or per­sonal me­dia,” Datuk Sai­fud­din said.</p>
    <p>“We en­cour­age film­ing ac­tiv­i­ties, but ev­ery­thing is sub­ject to ex­ist­ing laws and reg­u­la­tions.”</p>
    <p>He faced a storm of crit­i­cism in­clud­ing from peo­ple who went onto his so­cial me­dia plat­forms to say the videos he had posted did not seem to have the Fi­nas li­cence ei­ther.</p>
    <p>Mr Sai­fud­din is­sued a state­ment yes­ter­day evening, say­ing: “It must be stressed that the Perikatan Na­sional gov­ern­ment never and does not in­tend to use this Act to ob­struct per­sonal free­dom on so­cial me­dia, a phe­nom­ena that did not ex­ist when the Act was drafted.”</p>
    <p>He said me­dia plat­forms, such as TikTok and YouTube, did not ex­ist when the Act was passed in 1981, and that the reg­u­la­tion needed to be up­dated.</p>
    <p>“I ex­plained in a press con­fer­ence in my 100-day re­port card on June 20 that the min­istry is as­sess­ing all the laws that come un­der it. We are open to sug­ges­tions to im­prove all these laws, and not just the ones de­bated in Par­lia­ment, to be rel­e­vant with the times,” he said.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment’s en­force­ment of the li­cence re­quire­ment un­der the Fi­nas Act against Al Jazeera – the first time it is be­ing used against a me­dia out­let – has drawn con­cerns from me­dia watch­dogs in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The Cen­tre for In­de­pen­dent Jour­nal­ism said that it was alarmed by the gov­ern­ment’s ac­tions against the broad­caster.</p>
    <p>Al Jazeera, which has stood by its re­port, dis­missed the li­cence re­quire­ment in a state­ment on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>It said that by Fi­nas’ own def­i­ni­tion, Al Jazeera’s 101 East doc­u­men­tary is a cur­rent af­fairs show that does not fall un­der the body’s li­cens­ing re­quire­ments.</p>
