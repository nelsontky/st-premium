    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s found­ing fa­thers must have re­alised that the race, re­li­gion and lan­guage di­vide would not go away.</p>
    <p>While the NRIC de­fines each one of us in terms of his name, race, date of birth, sex and coun­try of birth, the Pledge en­cour­ages us to re­main as one united peo­ple re­gard­less of race, lan­guage or re­li­gion. I agree with Mr Asad Latif that, ideally, the al­ter­na­tive and le­git­i­mate means of self-iden­ti­fi­ca­tion that re­sists the temp­ta­tion to be­long to a sin­gu­lar, pu­ta­tive iden­tity must be the way for­ward (The il­lu­sion of one iden­tity, Dec 24).</p>
    <p>But, in re­al­ity, one would be quite pre­pared to fight for his free­dom to be as­so­ci­ated with his race, lan­guage, re­li­gion and cul­ture, should he feel forced to con­form to an im­posed iden­tity that un­der­mined his her­itage.</p>
    <p>It is a gov­ern­ment’s method of in­flu­enc­ing so­ci­ety – so as to en­sure the pub­lic good pre­vails – that mat­ters most.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s sec­u­lar­ism is unique; no one re­li­gion is su­pe­rior to an­other. It lev­els the play­ing field for all re­li­gions to co­ex­ist in the com­fort of trust.</p>
    <p>That the Gov­ern­ment has never had to in­voke the Main­te­nance of Reli­gious Har­mony Act, which was en­acted in 1990, speaks vol­umes about its de­ter­rent ef­fect on ex­treme in­ter­pre­ta­tions of any faith to at­tack the be­liefs and prac­tices of an­other re­li­gion.</p>
    <p>In the con­text of Sin­ga­pore’s sec­u­lar­ism, I be­lieve peo­ple are free to choose their iden­ti­ties. If be­ing Hindu, Mus­lim, Chris­tian, Bud­dhist or non-reli­gious is one’s self-iden­ti­fi­ca­tion, so be it, as long as his free­dom to be him­self doesn’t sti­fle the pub­lic good.</p>
