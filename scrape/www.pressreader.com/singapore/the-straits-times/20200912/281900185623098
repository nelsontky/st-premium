    <p>BEIJING/NEW DELHI • China and In­dia said yes­ter­day they had agreed to de-es­ca­late re­newed ten­sions on their con­tested Hi­malayan bor­der and take steps to re­store peace and tran­quil­lity, fol­low­ing a di­plo­matic meeting in Moscow.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi and his In­dian coun­ter­part S. Jais­hankar met in Moscow on Thurs­day and reached a five-point con­sen­sus, in­clud­ing agree­ments that troops from both sides should quickly dis­en­gage.</p>
    <p>Struck on the side­lines of a Shang­hai Co­op­er­a­tion Or­gan­i­sa­tion meeting, the con­sen­sus came af­ter a con­fronta­tion at the bor­der area in the western Hi­malayas.</p>
    <p>In a joint state­ment, they said: “The two for­eign min­is­ters agreed that the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion in the bor­der ar­eas is not in the in­ter­est of ei­ther side. They agreed there­fore that the bor­der troops of both sides should con­tinue their di­a­logue, quickly dis­en­gage, main­tain proper dis­tance and ease ten­sions.”</p>
    <p>Mr Jais­hankar told Mr Wang the im­me­di­ate task would be for troops to step back from the “ar­eas of fric­tion” so that things do not get worse. Troops are barely a few hun­dred me­tres apart at some points.</p>
    <p>China and In­dia ac­cused each other of fir­ing into the air dur­ing the con­fronta­tion, a vi­o­la­tion of long-held pro­to­col not to use firearms on the sen­si­tive frontier.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang told Mr Jais­hankar the “im­per­a­tive is to im­me­di­ately stop provo­ca­tions such as fir­ing and other dan­ger­ous ac­tions that vi­o­late the com­mit­ments made by the two sides”, China’s For­eign Min­istry said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He also told Mr Jais­hankar that all per­son­nel and equip­ment that have tres­passed at the bor­der must be moved to de-es­ca­late the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>In June, ten­sions erupted into a clash, in which 20 In­dian sol­diers were killed and China suf­fered an un­spec­i­fied num­ber of ca­su­al­ties.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ters’ meeting in Moscow lasted for two hours and was the lat­est di­plo­matic ef­fort to head off a broader con­flict be­tween the world’s two most pop­u­lous coun­tries, which went to war in 1962.</p>
    <p>Mr Jais­hankar told Mr Wang In­dia was deeply con­cerned about the build-up of Chi­nese forces on the Line of Ac­tual Con­trol (LAC) on the poorly de­fined bor­der.</p>
    <p>“The provoca­tive be­hav­iour of Chi­nese front-line troops at nu­mer­ous in­ci­dents of fric­tion along the LAC also showed dis­re­gard for bi­lat­eral agree­ments and pro­to­cols,” Mr Jais­hankar said, adding that any uni­lat­eral at­tempt to change the sta­tus quo would be re­sisted.</p>
