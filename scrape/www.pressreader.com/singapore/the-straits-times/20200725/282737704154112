    <p>What do spoil­ers and air-dams do for the car? I un­der­stand they help the car’s aero­dy­nam­ics and I have seen cars fit­ted with af­ter­mar­ket body parts for this pur­pose. Of­ten, it makes the car look sporty, but I have also seen some that de­stroy its aes­thet­ics.</p>
    <p>In the over­all de­sign of a car, aero­dy­nam­ics is an im­por­tant as­pect for de­vel­op­ing a body shape that trav­els smoothly through the air while main­tain­ing sta­bil­ity at speed.</p>
    <p>Tests in hugely ex­pen­sive pur­pose-built wind tun­nels are used by car man­u­fac­tur­ers to sim­u­late the be­hav­iour of air as the car trav­els through vary­ing at­mo­spheric con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>The stud­ies also re­veal how the car’s sta­bil­ity is af­fected in the pres­ence of high-speed air­flow.</p>
    <p>The term “drag” refers to the re­sis­tance to the mo­tion of a ve­hi­cle cre­ated by the am­bi­ent air. A car that is shaped for min­i­mal drag is said to be aero­dy­nam­i­cally ef­fi­cient, which is ben­e­fi­cial to fuel econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Cru­cially, wind-tun­nel data is also used to make de­tailed changes to the body shape, to erad­i­cate any desta­bil­is­ing ef­fects caused by the fast-flow­ing air around the car.</p>
    <p>This is where spoil­ers and air-dams come into the pic­ture. These ap­pendages “spoil” the nat­u­ral route the air wants to take and di­vert the flow through dif­fer­ent paths – all for the sake of en­hanc­ing sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, at the same time, some in­crease in drag is in­evitable.</p>
    <p>The aero­dy­namist there­fore strives to achieve the best bal­ance be­tween sta­bil­ity and drag.</p>
    <p>The air-dam (a spoiler fit­ted at the lower part of the front bumper) and rear boot-mounted spoiler are de­signed pri­mar­ily to re­duce front and rear lift, which re­sults from the higher-pres­sure air un­der the car rel­a­tive to the air that flows over the bonnet, roof and boot. Spoil­ers al­le­vi­ate the lift-in­duc­ing pres­sure dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>At the other ex­treme of aero­dy­namic de­sign, mod­i­fi­ca­tions to the car’s body shape and the fitting of com­plex spoil­ers, winglets and fins can cre­ate down-force (op­po­site of lift), an aero­dy­namic ef­fect used on rac­ing cars and ex­treme-per­for­mance road cars for high-speed sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Some af­ter­mar­ket spoil­ers might make your car look fast and sporty, but un­less they are ac­ces­sories from the car man­u­fac­turer, it would be pru­dent to re­search the ori­gin of such parts. The last thing you want is a badly de­signed spoiler that causes more drag or less sta­bil­ity, or both.</p>
    <p>Aero­dy­nam­ics is a com­plex sci­ence, so spoil­ers are not just plas­tic mould­ings for cos­metic en­hance­ment.</p>
