    <p>Min­is­ter for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Grace Fu makes it a point to check the ther­mo­stat ev­ery­where she goes – and that in­cludes the Is­tana.</p>
    <p>She is check­ing to make sure the tem­per­a­ture is set no lower than 25 deg C, a go-green tip from the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency un­der her charge.</p>
    <p>“I think I’ve raised the tem­per­a­ture in Is­tana,” she said in an in­ter­view with The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Ms Fu was speak­ing fig­u­ra­tively, but re­mind­ing the pub­lic ser­vice to place sus­tain­abil­ity at its core is a role she sees her­self and her min­istry play­ing.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, her newly re­named min­istry is re­view­ing guide­lines to make sus­tain­abil­ity a part of gov­ern­ment pro­cure­ment de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>“Any­thing the Gov­ern­ment would do, from (mak­ing) in­vest­ments to build­ing (in­fra­struc­ture), we will want them to con­sider sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, if I want to build a school, univer­sity, (or make) any ma­jor cap­i­tal in­vest­ments, I think the pub­lic ser­vice would want to think about its car­bon foot­print, its en­ergy ef­fi­ciency, its wa­ter ef­fi­ciency, its waste re­cy­cling fa­cil­i­ties, for ex­am­ple,” said Ms Fu, who took on the port­fo­lio in the Cab­i­net reshuf­fle in July.</p>
    <p>Sus­tain­abil­ity is not a new con­cept for Sin­ga­pore, she noted, cit­ing how the Repub­lic, which has no nat­u­ral wa­ter re­sources, had dealt with the is­sue of scarcity.</p>
    <p>Ms Fu, who was pre­vi­ously Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Community and Youth, was also Sec­ond Min­is­ter for the Min­istry of the En­vi­ron­ment and Wa­ter Re­sources be­tween 2012 and 2015.</p>
    <p>The sec­tor has changed over the years. For one thing, the aware­ness of and mo­men­tum to­wards sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment is much stronger, she said, adding that even cor­po­rate en­ti­ties are be­gin­ning to re­alise the im­por­tance of sus­tain­able busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Ms Fu, 56, said the dif­fer­ent ministries are in­cor­po­rat­ing sus­tain­abil­ity in their plans as well.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the Trans­port Min­istry had ear­lier de­clared its am­bi­tion to phase out in­ter­nal com­bus­tion engine ve­hi­cles by 2040.</p>
    <p>“So un­like other coun­tries, we didn’t have a sus­tain­abil­ity or green bud­get, but ac­tu­ally I think you can find el­e­ments of it in many, many ministries,” she added.</p>
    <p>World­wide, there is a grow­ing view that two crises – the pan­demic and cli­mate change – can be tack­led si­mul­ta­ne­ously by re­build­ing economies that are greener and more re­silient, and cre­at­ing new jobs and less de­struc­tive in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>Some coun­tries, such as Bri­tain and South Korea, have re­sponded to this by rolling out “green re­cov­ery” plans.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Fu: “In Sin­ga­pore I think our suc­ces­sive Bud­get amend­ments were very much about re­ally sup­port­ing busi­nesses through Covid-19 in the im­me­di­ate time­frame, and also cre­at­ing jobs... The ministries are now look­ing at ways to build up those (sus­tain­able) ca­pa­bil­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>By 2030, she hopes re­cy­cling rates will go up, re­search and de­vel­op­ment ef­forts will pay off in terms of cre­at­ing new jobs and com­pa­nies here, and Sin­ga­pore will be a cleaner place.</p>
    <p>“Not be­cause we have more clean­ers, but be­cause we have fewer clean­ers – that we clean bet­ter, our clean­ers are treated bet­ter, and most im­por­tantly, our peo­ple them­selves have clean habits,” she said.</p>
    <p>GREEN MIND­SET</p>
    <p>If I want to build a school, univer­sity, (or make) any ma­jor cap­i­tal in­vest­ments, I think the pub­lic ser­vice would want to think about its car­bon foot­print, its en­ergy ef­fi­ciency, its wa­ter ef­fi­ciency, its waste re­cy­cling fa­cil­i­ties, for ex­am­ple.</p>
