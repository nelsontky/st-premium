    <p>LON­DON • The equa­tion for Chelsea to­day is sim­ple – avoid de­feat by Wolver­hamp­ton Wan­der­ers at Stam­ford Bridge and the Blues will be play­ing Cham­pi­ons League foot­ball next sea­son.</p>
    <p>How­ever, man­ager Frank Lam­pard has in­sisted his side will “ap­proach it to win” and there will be no let-up in their fi­nal Premier League game of the cam­paign.</p>
    <p>“There’s no other way to ap­proach a game of foot­ball,” he said on Fri­day. “They are a very good op­po­nent, we’ve seen that all sea­son. We’re aware but we’ll try to win.”</p>
    <p>Chelsea, fourth and level on 63 points with third-placed Manch­ester United but be­hind on goal dif­fer­ence, need a win or a draw to guar­an­tee a top-four fin­ish.</p>
    <p>A loss may see them miss out on Cham­pi­ons League qual­i­fi­ca­tion if fifth-placed Le­ices­ter win or draw their match against United.</p>
    <p>Wolves, in sixth, started their sea­son last July with Europa League qual­i­fiers and Lam­pard be­lieves coach Nuno Espir­ito Santo has done an “in­cred­i­ble job” while play­ing nearly 60 matches this sea­son.</p>
    <p>“The man­ager has a great sense of hu­mil­ity and work ethic. That’s why it will be such a hard game,” Lam­pard said. “They have a lot of talent and an iden­tity with a unique way of mak­ing it dif­fi­cult.”</p>
    <p>Nuno re­turned the favour and said: “Frank is do­ing a fan­tas­tic job. We have to be fo­cused on the game and look at Chelsea as a big op­po­nent, but at the same time, let’s play. Let’s com­pete.”</p>
    <p>Wed­nes­day night’s 5-3 loss to Liver­pool high­lighted the Blues’ de­fen­sive woes once more.</p>
    <p>When asked if it is dif­fi­cult to coach his de­fence as a for­mer cre­ative player, Lam­pard, who is Chelsea’s all-time top scorer with 211 goals, dis­agreed but said: “It’s true we’ve con­ceded too many goals. We need to keep work­ing to bring that down.”</p>
    <p>He re­vealed mid­fielder N’Golo Kante could fea­ture af­ter miss­ing the last five matches with a ham­string in­jury. Wolves have no fresh in­jury con­cerns.</p>
    <p>Lam­pard also ad­mit­ted that he lost con­trol when ar­gu­ing with Liver­pool boss Jur­gen Klopp on the touch­line at An­field on Wed­nes­day but has no re­grets over stand­ing up for his team.</p>
    <p>A clip on so­cial me­dia showed a vis­i­bly ag­i­tated Lam­pard ges­tur­ing and yelling ex­ple­tives at Klopp and the Liver­pool dugout when the home side won a free kick.</p>
    <p>Klopp, mean­while, hit back af­ter Lam­pard branded the Reds “ar­ro­gant” in his post-match in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>“Frank was ob­vi­ously in a re­ally com­pet­i­tive mood. But he has to learn to fin­ish it with the fi­nal whis­tle and he didn’t do that,” he said.</p>

        <p data-role="text">With 17 goals in all com&#xAD;pe&#xAD;ti&#xAD;tions, it has been a break&#xAD;out sea&#xAD;son for Manch&#xAD;ester United&#x2019;s 18-year-old for&#xAD;ward Ma&#xAD;son Green&#xAD;wood.</p>
