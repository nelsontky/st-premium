    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Covid-19 cases in the com­mu­nity have been at an all-time low. But the multi-min­istry task force tack­ling the virus has said that phase three could hap­pen be­fore the end of the year only if three con­di­tions were met: a 70 per cent TraceTo­gether take-up rate, safe man­age­ment com­pli­ance and suf­fi­cient test­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Covid-19 cases in the com­mu­nity have been at an all­time low, with zero lo­cal cases for two weeks last month.</p>
    <p>This has raised hopes that the Repub­lic could see off the dif­fi­cult year with a tran­si­tion into phase three of its re­open­ing, which would see more eas­ing of re­stric­tions in­clud­ing al­low­ing for larger gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>The multi-min­istry task force tack­ling the pan­demic has said, how­ever, that phase three can hap­pen be­fore the end of the year only if three key con­di­tions are met.</p>
    <p>They are: a 70 per cent TraceTo­gether take-up rate, safe man­age­ment com­pli­ance and suf­fi­cient test­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>It has been more than five months since the coun­try moved into phase two of its pro­gres­sive re­open­ing, fol­low­ing an eight-week cir­cuit breaker from April 7.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts say the ma­jor stum­bling block to phase three is the in­ad­e­quate adop­tion of the TraceTo­gether app or to­ken, which helps to fa­cil­i­tate more ef­fec­tive con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>So far, around 2.9 mil­lion peo­ple have down­loaded the app or col­lected the to­ken, the Smart Na­tion and Dig­i­tal Gov­ern­ment Of­fice said. With a to­tal pop­u­la­tion of 5.7 mil­lion in Sin­ga­pore, the up­take of TraceTo­gether is 50.8 per cent, a far cry from the 70 per cent tar­get.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Alex Cook, vice-dean of re­search at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said: “One of the tar­gets set has been for suf­fi­cient num­bers of peo­ple to have TraceTo­gether as more ef­fec­tive con­tact trac­ing will counter the re­lax­ation in rules. I think we’re not yet at that tar­get, and that may hold us back from ad­vanc­ing a phase.”</p>
    <p>His col­league, Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the school, agrees, not­ing that adop­tion of TraceTo­gether is lag­ging.</p>
    <p>He said: “At present, it ap­pears we will not be moving to phase three by the end of the year as it ap­pears that to­ken dis­tri­bu­tion has not achieved a com­plete cov­er­age of the en­tire pop­u­la­tion.”</p>
    <p>By the end of the month, the coun­try will move away from SafeEn­try, and check­ing in with the TraceTo­gether app or to­ken will be manda­tory at public venues in­clud­ing restau­rants and shop­ping malls.</p>
    <p>The to­kens are be­ing dis­trib­uted one con­stituency at a time and are cur­rently be­ing given out at 37 com­mu­nity cen­tres and clubs, in­clud­ing Alju­nied CC and Bukit Ba­tok CC.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in re­cent months, the TraceTo­gether pro­gramme has seen some teething is­sues in­clud­ing com­plaints about the app drain­ing phone bat­ter­ies, as well as a surge in de­mand for to­kens, which meant that not ev­ery­one has been able to get hold of one.</p>
    <p>Since the start of the pan­demic, rig­or­ous test­ing regimes have been in place, in­clud­ing as part of com­mu­nity sur­veil­lance. These have helped to de­tect and iso­late cases.</p>
    <p>Eight lo­cal cases have been de­tected since Nov 26, in­clud­ing a stall­holder and a mi­grant worker dur­ing the mass test­ing of those work­ing in and around Tekka Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Whether a com­mu­nity case is linked or un­linked is also worth not­ing. Of the eight re­cent cases, at least five were un­linked while two be­longed to the dorms.</p>
    <p>But there is no need to be overly wor­ried, Prof Cook said, as the two Tekka cases seem to be iso­lated, sug­gest­ing that in­fec­tion con­trol mea­sures have been ef­fec­tive in halt­ing trans­mis­sion chains.</p>
    <p>When asked why Tekka Mar­ket was cho­sen as a test­ing site, Prof Cook ex­plained: “Peo­ple work­ing in cus­tomer-fac­ing roles are more likely to in­ter­act with a case and thus to get in­fected them­selves.”</p>
    <p>He also high­lighted the ways in which test­ing can be done: Proac­tively – such as the pre-school swab­bing ex­er­cise to pro­vide re­as­sur­ance that it was safe to re­open preschools af­ter the cir­cuit breaker – and re­ac­tively, such as when those work­ing in the public bus de­pots and in­ter­changes were tested in re­sponse to a clus­ter that broke out at the Bukit Pan­jang In­te­grated Trans­port Hub in July.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher, se­nior con­sul­tant in the in­fec­tious dis­eases di­vi­sion at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal, said Sin­ga­pore’s test­ing strat­egy is multi-faceted. It in­cludes test­ing those with acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion and close con­tacts, and rou­tine test­ing of res­i­dents in high­risk dor­mi­to­ries and in­dus­tries as well as front-line work­ers.</p>
    <p>He said: “I be­lieve con­tin­u­ing sur­veil­lance in places like hawker stalls is sim­ply an ex­ten­sion of such ef­forts to look around for cases and at the same time re­as­sure our­selves that there is no sig­nif­i­cant com­mu­nity spread go­ing un­recog­nised.”</p>
    <p>With the out­break well un­der con­trol, Sin­ga­pore has the op­por­tu­nity to re­di­rect that ca­pac­ity to look for any uniden­ti­fied prob­lems, he added. “It’s quite a lux­ury com­pared to the rest of the world.”</p>
    <p>KEEP­ING TO THE RULES</p>
    <p>The public seems to have been gen­er­ally com­ply­ing with the rules around mask wear­ing, so­cial dis­tanc­ing and gath­er­ing in groups of no more than five, Prof Teo noted, an area that the coun­try must score well in be­fore the gates to phase three open.</p>
    <p>How­ever, some black sheep re­main. For in­stance, on Nov 28, about 30 peo­ple across six ta­bles in</p>
    <p>Tekka Cen­tre were al­legedly in­ter­min­gling, ac­cord­ing to a Lianhe Zaobao re­port.</p>
    <p>This was one of four re­cent re­ported in­ci­dents of non-com­pli­ance.</p>
    <p>Last week, Gemma Steak­house at Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore was or­dered to close for 20 days start­ing last Thurs­day, for flout­ing safe man­age­ment mea­sures dur­ing a din­ner in­volv­ing 75 peo­ple in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>On Satur­day, shoe re­tailer Foot Locker’s Or­chard out­let was or­dered to close for 10 days af­ter large crowds gath­ered at the store the day be­fore.</p>
    <p>The re­sponse to these in­fringe­ments shows the Gov­ern­ment is com­mit­ted to tak­ing ac­tion against those who do not keep to the rules, Prof Cook said.</p>
    <p>RISKS FROM ABROAD</p>
    <p>With some coun­tries ex­pe­ri­enc­ing new waves of Covid-19 in­fec­tion, and the re­cent burst­ing of the Hong Kong travel bub­ble, ques­tions have been raised if the re­gional and global sit­u­a­tion will af­fect Sin­ga­pore’s phase three re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>If Sin­ga­pore does not in­tend to fur­ther re­view its bor­der con­trol mea­sures, then the global sit­u­a­tion ac­tu­ally has very lit­tle bear­ing on Sin­ga­pore, Prof Teo said.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, if we are ac­tively mak­ing plans to ease fur­ther move­ments of busi­ness trav­ellers and tourists in, then cer­tainly we will be pru­dent to con­sider what is hap­pen­ing glob­ally, es­pe­cially amongst our key busi­ness and tourism part­ner coun­tries.”</p>
    <p>Prof Cook said the global sit­u­a­tion and resur­gence of cases as coun­tries open up pro­vide var­i­ous lessons on what can go wrong in the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“I think we will want to avoid go­ing into phase three and then re­vert­ing to a more strin­gent level of con­trol if the cases pop back up, and the risk of a volte-face will be one of the things be­ing con­sid­ered.”</p>
    <p>Prof Teo cau­tioned that with ad­di­tional re­stric­tions eased in phase three, in­clud­ing al­low­ing for larger gath­er­ings, the risk of an un­con­trolled and ac­cel­er­ated spread within the com­mu­nity will in­crease, as seen in places such as Hong Kong and South Korea.</p>
    <p>South Korea is be­ing gripped by a third wave of in­fec­tions, with 631 new cases on Satur­day – the high­est in nine months.</p>
    <p>Clus­ters have been sprout­ing rapidly in var­i­ous parts of Seoul, in­clud­ing a call cen­tre, gym and a univer­sity, mak­ing it dif­fi­cult for the au­thor­i­ties to stem the spread. Only about 15 per cent of cases re­ported in the past two weeks could be traced to known trans­mis­sion routes. “It is these kinds of ac­cel­er­ated spread that we want to con­trol with our public health mea­sures,” said Prof Teo.</p>
    <p>Prof Cook re­mains up­beat about Sin­ga­pore’s Covid-19 per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>The na­tion has kept deaths very low – just shy of 30 – and if the United States were to be shrunk to the size of Sin­ga­pore, they would have had 4,500 deaths, he pointed out.</p>
    <p>There have been over 280,000 Covid-19 deaths in the US.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, health­care work­ers have pro­vided great care, gov­ern­ment poli­cies have been sen­si­ble and ev­i­dence-based, and most peo­ple have been keep­ing to the rules.</p>
    <p>“Per­son­ally, I think we’re ready to move into phase three,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The longer we’re sub­ject to re­stric­tions but have low cases, the more peo­ple will strug­gle to stay mo­ti­vated to follow the rules. Moving to phase three will be a demon­stra­tion that ev­ery­one’s sac­ri­fices have been worth it to make progress back to nor­malcy.”</p>
    <p>By the end of the month, the coun­try will move away from SafeEn­try, and check­ing in with the TraceTo­gether app or to­ken will be manda­tory at public venues in­clud­ing restau­rants and shop­ping malls. The to­kens are be­ing dis­trib­uted one con­stituency at a time.</p>
