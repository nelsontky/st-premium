    <p>KOH CHIVANG (Cam­bo­dia) • More than a mil­lion peo­ple live on or around the Tonle Sap lake, but wa­ter lev­els have plum­meted and fish stocks have dwin­dled due to cli­mate change and dams up­stream on the Mekong River.</p>
    <p>Tonle Sap – the largest freshwater lake in South-east Asia dur­ing the wet sea­son – was once renowned for its abun­dance of fish and wildlife. Fish­er­man Leng Vann, 43, re­calls catch­ing hun­dreds of kilo­grams a day in his nets.</p>
    <p>His house, which floats on the lake, sits 5m lower than it should in mid-Oc­to­ber, at the end of the rainy sea­son. And when he draws his net from the wa­ters, it is empty.</p>
    <p>The lake, a world her­itage eco­log­i­cal re­serve, de­pends on an un­usual sea­sonal re­ver­sal – in the dry sea­son, it drains into the Mekong via a fast-flow­ing river artery. But when the rains come from May to Oc­to­ber, the mighty Mekong is so pow­er­ful that the wa­ter flows back­wards, re­plen­ish­ing the lake.</p>
    <p>It swells more than four times its small­est size to 14,500 sq km at the height of the floods, ac­cord­ing to the Mekong River Com­mis­sion – an area big­ger than Le­banon.</p>
    <p>But last year, the amount of wa­ter that flowed into the lake was down about a quar­ter from the av­er­age lev­els seen around the turn of the cen­tury. This ef­fect has been at its low­est since 1997, lead­ing to ex­tremely dry con­di­tions, says the Mekong River Com­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Weather con­di­tions linked to cli­mate change, such as a ma­jor drought last year, have con­trib­uted to the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>En­vi­ron­men­tal­ists also point to the dozen or so ma­jor dams built across the main­stream Mekong as a fac­tor in slow­ing the flow, along with smaller ir­ri­ga­tion dams built on trib­u­tary rivers.</p>
    <p>The change in wa­ter lev­els is hav­ing a ma­jor ef­fect on the sur­round­ing wet­lands, pre­cip­i­tat­ing a</p>
    <p>de­cline in en­dan­gered species liv­ing near the lake, ac­cord­ing to a re­cent study by the Wildlife Con­ser­va­tion So­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>“With­out ur­gent, co­or­di­nated ac­tion... the ecosys­tem that has sus­tained Cam­bo­dia for gen­er­a­tions may be lost,” it said.</p>
    <p>Low fish stocks have pushed most of the 2,600 fish­ing fam­i­lies liv­ing in Koh Chivang – a com­mu­nity of five float­ing vil­lages on the lake – to grow chilli and other crops to sup­ple­ment their liv­ing.</p>
    <p>They are now farm­ing land that used to be fish breed­ing grounds,</p>
    <p>and the com­mu­nity’s deputy leader Hun Sotharith says the il­le­gal clear­ing of sur­round­ing forests for agri­cul­ture is on the rise.</p>
    <p>Rangers also warn that other an­i­mal habi­tats are un­der im­mi­nent threat.</p>
    <p>Mr Leng Vann says he may soon need to travel to Siem Reap – about an hour’s boat ride from his home – to l ook for work for a few months. “We fish­er­men de­pend on wa­ter, fish and forests, so when th­ese are gone, we can ex­pect noth­ing,” he said. “It is over.”</p>
