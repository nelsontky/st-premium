    <p>Re­gional mar­kets were mixed but lo­cal shares headed north a smidgeon yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The more op­ti­mistic mood among in­vestors here helped lift the Straits Times In­dex (STI) 7.18 points or 0.28 per cent to 2,582.97.</p>
    <p>Gain­ers out­num­bered losers 237 to 185, with 1.62 bil­lion shares worth $1.27 bil­lion chang­ing hands.</p>
    <p>The STI’s big­gest gainer was Jar­dine Mathe­son, the holding firm for the Jar­dine em­pire, which gained 3.38 per cent to end at US$41.30.</p>
    <p>It was fol­lowed by agri-busi­ness group Wil­mar In­ter­na­tional, which rose 3.01 per cent to $4.45 on news that its Chi­nese unit, Yi­hai Kerry Arawana, re­sponded to more queries from Shen­zhen Stock Ex­change over its pro­posed list­ing. In­vestors likely read it as the com­pany inch­ing a step closer to a list­ing, which is ex­pected to be a share price cat­a­lyst for Wil­mar.</p>
    <p>The big­gest loser was Asia re­tail group Dairy Farm In­ter­na­tional, which re­treated 3.27 per cent to US$4.14, as ex­pec­ta­tions are for its re­sults to be im­pacted by the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>Penny stocks in the gold-min­ing and health­care sec­tors con­tin­ued to lead in trad­ing ac­tiv­ity. Miner CNMC Gold­mine racked up trad­ing vol­umes of 110.6 mil­lion shares, with An­chor Re­sources not far be­hind on 81.5 mil­lion shares traded. Medtecs In­ter­na­tional gained 14.4 per cent with 84.8 mil­lion shares done while Hy­phens Pharma added 10.38 per cent on trade of 56.5 mil­lion shares.</p>
    <p>Bloomberg re­ported that a block of 734,000 shares in Hy­phens Pharma traded at a mar­ket value of $477,740 yes­ter­day af­ter­noon, rep­re­sent­ing a 12 per cent pre­mium from the open price.</p>
    <p>The per­for­mance of re­gional mar­kets was mixed.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.69 per cent on hopes for a fresh United States stim­u­lus pack­age. But Ja­pan’s Nikkei 225 slid 0.26 per cent on cau­tion ahead of earn­ings re­ports later this week. South Korea’s Kospi ended 1.76 per cent higher with Sam­sung Elec­tron­ics ral­ly­ing as much as 5.8 per cent. China’s bench­mark Shang­hai Com­pos­ite In­dex added 0.71 per cent.</p>
    <p>“The re­al­ity is that the Fed has pro­claimed that they are go­ing to keep the print­ing presses rolling, they will print money and it has cre­ated this all-you-can-eat buf­fet,” Sierra In­vest­ment Man­age­ment an­a­lyst Terri Spath told Agence FrancePres­se. “The data doesn’t sup­port this and so ex­pect volatil­ity, ex­pect draw­downs go­ing for­ward. The bot­tom may be in for the year, but we do ex­pect volatil­ity in the fu­ture.”</p>
