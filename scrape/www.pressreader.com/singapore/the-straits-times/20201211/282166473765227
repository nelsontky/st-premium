    <p>Seven gov­ern­ment-funded spe­cial ed­u­ca­tion (Sped) schools will pro­gres­sively be­gin op­er­a­tions on new cam­puses at per­ma­nent sites from 2022.</p>
    <p>This is part of the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion’s (MOE) on­go­ing ef­forts to en­hance ac­ces­si­bil­ity to Sped for students with mod­er­ate to se­vere spe­cial ed­u­ca­tional needs.</p>
    <p>Be­tween 2017 and last year, the min­istry had said it would work with so­cial ser­vice agen­cies AWWA, the Autism As­so­ci­a­tion Sin­ga­pore, Rain­bow Cen­tre and Metta Wel­fare As­so­ci­a­tion to set up four new Sped schools.</p>
    <p>The aim was to ad­dress grow­ing de­mand for places for students with autism spec­trum dis­or­der (ASD) with in­tel­lec­tual im­pair­ment.</p>
    <p>These four Sped schools – Eden School 2, AWWA School 2, Rain­bow Cen­tre School 3 and Metta School 2 – will be­gin op­er­a­tions at their per­ma­nent sites be­tween 2022 and 2024.</p>
    <p>MOE said the of­fi­cial names of these schools will be con­firmed only at the time of school reg­is­tra­tion, be­fore the schools move to their per­ma­nent sites.</p>
    <p>Each school will pro­vide 25 places per year and each will have an even­tual to­tal ca­pac­ity for 300 students.</p>
    <p>Col­lec­tively, they will pro­vide up to 1,200 ad­di­tional places.</p>
    <p>In all, there will be six Sped schools cater­ing to students who have ASD with in­tel­lec­tual im­pair­ment from next year.</p>
    <p>The other two schools are Eden School and St An­drew’s Autism School.</p>
    <p>Last year, MOE also an­nounced three new gov­ern­ment-funded Sped schools to sup­port students with mod­er­ate spe­cial ed­u­ca­tional needs who have ASD but can still ac­cess the na­tional cur­ricu­lum.</p>
    <p>Two of the schools are Path­light School 2 and Path­light School 3, which are run by the Autism Re­source Cen­tre (Sin­ga­pore).</p>
    <p>Path­light School 2 will pro­vide 500 pri­mary-level school places and 300 post-pri­mary-level school places, while Path­light School 3 will pro­vide 500 pri­mary and 400 post-pri­mary-level school places.</p>
    <p>The third school will be run by St An­drew’s Mis­sion Hos­pi­tal. It was se­lected through a lim­ited in­vi­ta­tion for pro­pos­als ap­proach that was open to el­i­gi­ble agen­cies.</p>
    <p>This school will ini­tially pro­vide 75 places per co­hort, but it will be able to pro­vide 500 pri­mary and 350 post-pri­mary-level school places once it shifts to its per­ma­nent site in Cle­menti.</p>
    <p>Along with Path­light School 1, there will be four gov­ern­ment­funded Sped schools that sup­port such students with mod­er­ate spe­cial ed­u­ca­tional needs from 2022.</p>
