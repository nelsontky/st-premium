    <p>We thank Mr Loong Chik Tong for his feed­back on the ex­pe­ri­ence he had at the Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>Na­tional Eye Cen­tre (SNEC) (Long wait to see doc­tor at eye cen­tre, Dec 18, 2020).</p>
    <p>Mr Loong asked if the SNEC clinic he vis­ited was over­whelmed with pa­tients. The SNEC Oc­u­lar In­flam­ma­tion and Im­munol­ogy Clinic man­ages com­plex cases, usu­ally re­quir­ing mul­ti­ple tests to be per­formed be­fore the pa­tient sees the doc­tor.</p>
    <p>These tests al­low our doc­tors to per­form a more com­pre­hen­sive as­sess­ment of eye con­di­tions, which may con­trib­ute to the longer wait time for these pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Be­cause this clinic is a sub­spe­cial­ity clinic that caters to com­plex eye con­di­tions, a longer con­sul­ta­tion time may be re­quired, es­pe­cially when ur­gent in­ter­ven­tion and im­promptu in­ves­ti­ga­tions are re­quired for man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>As Mr Loong men­tioned, he re­quired an im­promptu an­te­rior cham­ber tap pro­ce­dure to be per­formed which ac­counted for the ad­di­tional wait­ing time on his sec­ond visit. He also re­ceived ther­apy while wait­ing for the pro­ce­dure to be per­formed.</p>
    <p>We agree with Mr Loong that long wait­ing times are not ideal for pa­tients, es­pe­cially if they are el­derly, and we will con­tinue to en­hance our in­ter­nal pro­cesses to ad­dress this.</p>
    <p>Last year, due to so­cial dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions, we also im­ple­mented safety mea­sures while aim­ing to min­imise wait­ing times.</p>
    <p>SNEC re­views the work­load reg­u­larly to en­sure that each doc­tor’s clinic load is bal­anced and pa­tients are seen in a timely man­ner at their sched­uled ap­point­ment times.</p>
    <p>We have also in­tro­duced free home delivery of med­i­ca­tions to shorten pa­tients’ stay at SNEC.</p>
    <p>We plan to im­ple­ment video con­sul­ta­tions for suit­able pa­tients.</p>
    <p>We are also ac­tively dis­charg­ing pa­tients who do not need reg­u­lar fol­low-up so that we can man­age more com­plex eye prob­lems that re­quire treat­ment.</p>
    <p>We seek Mr Loong’s and other pa­tients’ un­der­stand­ing as we im­ple­ment these mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Mr Loong also men­tioned the cost of Sim­brinza eye drops. As this is a non-stan­dard eye drop, given only when stan­dard eye drops are not suit­able, it does not qual­ify for any gov­ern­ment sub­sidy.</p>
    <p>We have con­tacted Mr Loong to clar­ify his wait­ing times and ad­dress his con­cerns.</p>
