    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The US mil­i­tary has slammed China for fail­ing to ap­pear for vir­tual, se­nior-level meet­ings this week, call­ing it “an­other ex­am­ple that China does not hon­our its agree­ments”, but Bei­jing said the US ver­sion of events dis­torted the facts.</p>
    <p>Sino-US ties have fur­ther wors­ened this year over a range of is­sues, from Bei­jing’s han­dling of the coro­n­avirus to US sup­port for Tai­wan, China’s clampdown on Hong Kong and rows over Chi­nese tele­coms equip­ment maker Huawei.</p>
    <p>The US has also long op­posed China’s ex­pan­sive ter­ri­to­rial claims in the South China Sea and has sent war­ships reg­u­larly through the strate­gic wa­ter­way.</p>
    <p>Ad­mi­ral Phil David­son, head of the US Indo-Pa­cific Com­mand, on Wed­nes­day said that China’s noshow for the sched­uled meet­ings “should serve as a re­minder to all na­tions as they pur­sue agree­ments with China go­ing for­ward”.</p>
    <p>China had been due to par­tic­i­pate in this week’s meet­ings – from Mon­day to Wed­nes­day – re­lated to the Mil­i­tary Mar­itime Con­sul­ta­tive Agree­ment (MMCA) fo­cused on mar­itime safety, he said.</p>
    <p>China’s Navy re­jected the crit­i­cism, say­ing re­spon­si­bil­ity for the fail­ure of the meet­ing to go ahead “rests solely with the United States”.</p>
    <p>China pro­vided the US side with sug­ges­tions for the meet­ing on Nov 18, Naval Colonel Liu Wen­sheng of the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army (PLA) Navy said.</p>
    <p>But the US “in­sisted on push­ing its uni­lat­eral agenda”, ar­bi­trar­ily short­en­ing and chang­ing the na­ture of the meet­ing and “even at­tempt­ing to force China to par­tic­i­pate in the meet­ing be­fore the two sides reached an agree­ment on the top­ics”, Col Liu said.</p>
    <p>The US mil­i­tary said it has met the PLA reg­u­larly since 1998 to con­duct the MMCA di­a­logue. The talks this year were sched­uled to be held vir­tu­ally due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The MMCA is partly de­signed to re­view any un­safe mil­i­tary in­ci­dents that have oc­curred be­tween US and PLA forces.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, in a rare in­ter­view late on Tues­day, US Trade Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Robert Lighthizer told Reuters that Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den should keep press­ing China to stick to the phase 1 trade deal and use tar­iffs as lever­age.</p>
    <p>Mr Lighthizer said Bei­jing had done a “rea­son­ably good job” in im­ple­ment­ing parts of the deal, as he de­fended the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s record in shred­ding the sta­tus quo on trade and im­pos­ing uni­lat­eral tar­iffs on US$370 bil­lion (S$490 bil­lion) worth of Chi­nese goods.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing signed the phase 1 trade deal nearly a year ago af­ter months of tar­iffs, promis­ing to boost pur­chases of an ar­ray of US goods and ser­vices by US$200 bil­lion above 2017 lev­els over two years.</p>
    <p>“I would keep the tar­iffs in place for sure,” Mr Lighthizer said, when asked what he thought Mr Bi­den should do. “I think if you see the tar­iffs dis­si­pat­ing, that’s a sig­nal that we’re not se­ri­ous about un­der­stand­ing that China is a strate­gic ad­ver­sary.”</p>
