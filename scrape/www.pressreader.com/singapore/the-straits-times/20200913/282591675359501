    <p>No­body chooses which hos­pi­tal to go to be­cause the food at one is bet­ter than at an­other.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the newly minted food ser­vices team at Alexan­dra Hos­pi­tal wants to change the per­cep­tion that hos­pi­tal food is bland, bor­ing and taste­less.</p>
    <p>The hos­pi­tal used to out­source its meals, but has hired a team of about 30 to take charge of meals for the 215-bed hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Mr Se­bas­tian Low, head of the food ser­vices team, has 20 years of ex­pe­ri­ence work­ing in ho­tels, restau­rants and business, in­dus­trial and health­care cater­ing. Ex­ec­u­tive chef Nor­man Leow has 15 years of ex­pe­ri­ence work­ing in ho­tels, restau­rants and cruise lin­ers.</p>
    <p>They are op­er­at­ing out of a tem­po­rary kitchen while the one they are de­sign­ing from scratch is be­ing built. It is ex­pected to be ready in the first quar­ter of next year.</p>
    <p>The hos­pi­tal is work­ing to­wards mak­ing all pa­tient meals in-house. For ex­am­ple, in­stead of re­ly­ing on out­side sources for teatime treats, they plan to make their own muffins and banana and mar­ble cake, which will be free of preser­va­tives and ad­di­tives.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients who have dif­fi­culty swal­low­ing will be served dishes cooked from scratch in the kitchen – for ex­am­ple, steamed fish and spring onions. The dish will be finely chopped or pureed by the team, in­stead of hav­ing soft food done for them by ven­dors. They hope the im­proved flavour of the food will en­tice pa­tients to eat and re­cover.</p>
    <p>Chef Leow says: “We are mov­ing to­wards pro­duc­ing Miche­lin-star-level dishes. To­day, the pre­sen­ta­tion of hos­pi­tal meals is also chang­ing, like serv­ing it in casseroles in­stead of army style. Tasty and healthy food def­i­nitely ex­ists.”</p>
    <p>Alexan­dra de­cided to stop out­sourc­ing its food to have greater con­trol and flex­i­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>A spokesman says: “We have con­trol over the qual­ity of the raw in­gre­di­ents and can en­sure con­sis­tency i n the meals we serve pa­tients, es­pe­cially in the taste and pre­sen­ta­tion.”</p>
    <p>Bet­ter com­mu­ni­ca­tion be­tween ward staff, di­eti­tians and the peo­ple mak­ing the food is also pos­si­ble be­cause they all work on the same cam­pus. Con­trol­ling and keep­ing costs down is also an im­por­tant con­sid­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Chef Leow says a vi­tal part of his job is un­der­stand­ing pa­tients and their needs: “I put my­self in their shoes. We did a lot of R&D on our jelly to make sure pa­tients who have dif­fi­culty swal­low­ing can eat it.”</p>
    <p>He is also work­ing on in­tro­duc­ing hawker-style food such as nasi le­mak, char kway teow and mee re­bus. They will, of course, be tweaked to make them health­ier and to com­ply with nu­tri­tion guide­lines for pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Mr Low says: “You are not com­ing to Alexan­dra Hos­pi­tal be­cause our chicken masala is good.”</p>
    <p>But, Chef Leow adds, “if you are here, we re­ally want to make you happy”.</p>
