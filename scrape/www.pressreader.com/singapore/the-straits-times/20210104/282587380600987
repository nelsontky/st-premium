    <p>SHEILA SIM (Ac­tress)</p>
    <p>Eight hours of un­in­ter­rupted sleep. The thought of los­ing that – at least for the next five years, ac­cord­ing to her friends – wor­ried ac­tress Sheila Sim when she was try­ing for a baby.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally need a lot of sleep,” she says. “So it re­ally sur­prised me that I could still be en­er­getic with only two to three hours of sleep in the first month.”</p>
    <p>Sim, 36, and her bank ex­ec­u­tive-hus­band Deon Woo, 39, wel­comed their first child, Layla, on Sept 22 last year. “When I see her smile in the morn­ing, I’ll be 200 per cent recharged,” Sim adds.</p>
    <p>Gone are the nerve-rack­ing days when the new­born Layla would cry hys­ter­i­cally. Sim now un­der­stands her lit­tle one’s needs and emo­tions bet­ter, and can­not wait to hear her first word.</p>
    <p>Sim, who ob­tained a pos­i­tive psy­chol­ogy diploma from The School Of Pos­i­tive Psy­chol­ogy in Sin­ga­pore last July, hopes to be a mind­ful and con­scious par­ent.</p>
    <p>“Some­times, we have our own is­sues and un­ful­filled needs that we put upon our chil­dren. It should be about them and what they want; it’s the life that they de­serve, not the life that we want them to have,” she says.</p>
    <p>TAY KEWEI & AL­FRED SIM (Singers)</p>
    <p>Singer and ath­let­ics coach Al­fred Sim, 39, is al­ways sur­prised at how his two sons look so dif­fer­ent from each other.</p>
    <p>Both of them were “the same size and height at birth”, but his sec­ond child seems to grow faster.</p>
    <p>Born on June 28 last year, he is now “much big­ger” than the first­born when he was six months old.</p>
    <p>“Oh yes, he has less hair, big­ger eyes, too,” adds Sim, who is mar­ried to fel­low singer Tay Kewei, 37.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple have never re­vealed their chil­dren’s real names and call them by their nick­names.</p>
    <p>Momo, now three, nick­named his lit­tle brother Xiao Pian Pian.</p>
    <p>Be­ing sec­ond-time par­ents, Tay says they are more con­fi­dent in their roles and aware of baby devel­op­ment mile­stones.</p>
    <p>Tay adds: “I hope to ex­pose Xiao Pian Pian to as many new ex­pe­ri­ences as Momo.”</p>
    <p>2020 was all the more mem­o­rable for Sin­ga­pore per­son­al­i­ties who wel­comed new ad­di­tions to their fam­i­lies, re­ports Elisa Chia</p>
