    <p>• A nearly 40-mil­lionyear-old skele­ton be­long­ing to what is pop­u­larly called a sabre-toothed tiger has been sold for US$84,350 (S$112,700), a year af­ter its dis­cov­ery on a United States ranch.</p>
    <p>The skele­ton, about 120cm long, was snapped up by a pri­vate col­lec­tor in just one minute at an auc­tion in Geneva on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The orig­i­nal bones are those of a Ho­plo­phoneus – not tech­ni­cally cats, they are an ex­tinct genus of the Nim­ravi­dae fam­ily and once stalked the plains of North Amer­ica. Such ex­tinct preda­tory mam­mals are com­monly known as sabre-toothed tigers.</p>
    <p>Also on sale was a Tyran­nosaurus rex tooth which fetched just over US$6,000, while an 85cm-long fin from a Mosasaur – a marine rep­tile that in the Cre­ta­ceous pe­riod was at the top of the sub­ma­rine food chain – was bought for al­most US$8,000.</p>
    <p>A 75-mil­lion-year-old am­mo­lite – an opal-like or­ganic gem­stone in shades of red and orange – mea­sur­ing 40cm long by 36cm wide re­mained un­sold be­cause the re­serve price was not met.</p>
    <p>De­bate rages as to the right bal­ance be­tween the sci­en­tific value of such items and their worth on the open mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Some palaeon­tol­o­gists in­sist animal or plant fos­sils are not dec­o­ra­tive ob­jects, but witnesses to the evo­lu­tion of life on earth and there­fore sci­en­tific ar­ti­cles that ought to be stud­ied and then shared with the pub­lic in mu­se­ums.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the sale, Swiss col­lec­tor Yann Cuenin told Agence FrancePres­se: “If we’re talk­ing about the sabre-toothed tiger, for ex­am­ple, it’s not a skele­ton which is of ma­jor sci­en­tific in­ter­est... I am all for mu­se­ums, but I am also in favour of ob­jects liv­ing among us; for there to be col­lec­tors, for pieces to be bought and sold – that’s what brings cul­ture to life.”</p>
