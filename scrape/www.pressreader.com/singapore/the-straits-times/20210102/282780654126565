    <p>I have kept this plant for about a year. Re­cently, four or five leaves started drop­ping daily. The plant is also grow­ing new leaves and flower stalk. Is the plant dy­ing and how can I save it?</p>
    <p>Win­ston Seah</p>
    <p>The plant is the Co­di­aeum var­ie­ga­tum and it is com­monly called cro­ton by gar­den­ers.</p>
    <p>The is­sue de­scribed ap­pears to be one that is re­lated to wa­ter. Since the plant is grown in a pot, was it al­lowed to dry out on sev­eral oc­ca­sions? A plant that has been dried out and wilted will most prob­a­bly have its lower leaves turn­ing yel­low and drop­ping off.</p>
    <p>You may want to en­sure your plant is wa­tered reg­u­larly and thor­oughly. If the plant’s roots have filled the pot, move the plant into a larger con­tainer. A larger pot with more soil vol­ume will be able to hold more wa­ter for the plant’s use.</p>
    <p>You may also want to check the health of your plant’s roots by tak­ing the plant out of the pot and in­spect­ing the root sys­tem. Healthy roots will ap­pear white and solid. If roots are black and mushy, they are likely dead and this could be due to over­wa­ter­ing. Such roots will not be able to up­take wa­ter and should be pruned.</p>
    <p>If there are white cot­tony masses, they could be root mealy bugs. A chem­i­cal pes­ti­cide soak, such as one us­ing cyper­me­thrin, will kill the pests.</p>
