    <p>Care­giv­ing places sig­nif­i­cant strain on one’s fi­nances, as well as phys­i­cal and men­tal well-be­ing. When care­givers ex­pe­ri­ence burnout due to in­suf­fi­cient rest, they pose a risk to them­selves and oth­ers (Care­givers need to seek sup­port to avoid burnout: Ex­perts, Oct 19).</p>
    <p>One group of care­givers of­ten over­looked are the mi­grant do­mes­tic work­ers who many house­holds here in­creas­ingly de­pend on to care for the rapidly age­ing pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>When fam­ily mem­bers strug­gle to care for their el­derly rel­a­tives, they cope by pass­ing on most of the phys­i­cal labour, and some emo­tional labour, to their do­mes­tic helpers. But th­ese work­ers lack the sup­port to cope with their care­giver bur­den.</p>
    <p>An on­go­ing qual­i­ta­tive study by the As­so­ci­a­tion of Women for Ac­tion and Re­search (Aware) on care­giver bur­den ex­pe­ri­enced by 25 mi­grant do­mes­tic work­ers pro­vid­ing el­der­care in Sin­ga­pore iden­ti­fied the lack of ac­cess to care­giv­ing-spe­cific in­for­ma­tion and emo­tional sup­port as contributo­rs to the bur­den.</p>
    <p>Other fac­tors are over­work and in­ac­cu­rate match­ing to el­der­care jobs.</p>
    <p>Sup­port or­gan­i­sa­tions for mi­grant do­mes­tic work­ers are not equipped to pro­vide care­giv­ing-re­lated in­for­ma­tion, while ex­ist­ing care­giver-sup­port net­works of­ten fo­cus on fam­ily care­givers.</p>
    <p>Do­mes­tic work­ers must con­stantly adapt to the evolv­ing needs of their care re­cip­i­ents. When the con­di­tion of care re­cip­i­ents wors­ens, they be­come more de­pen­dent on the do­mes­tic work­ers, fur­ther in­creas­ing their work­load. New care­giv­ing du­ties may in­clude tube-feed­ing, man­ag­ing new med­i­ca­tion, as­sist­ing more fre­quently with toi­let­ing and/or di­a­per changes, and closer su­per­vi­sion to pre­vent falls and in­juries.</p>
    <p>With­out ad­e­quate sup­port, some work­ers strug­gle to cope with th­ese new re­spon­si­bil­i­ties. Yet, fear­ing for their jobs, they avoid voic­ing their con­cerns in case their em­ploy­ers see them as in­com­pe­tent.</p>
    <p>At present, em­ploy­ers and em­ploy­ment agen­cies are not in­cen­tivised to pro­vide ad­e­quate care­giver-spe­cific sup­port to do­mes­tic work­ers em­ployed for el­der­care.</p>
    <p>How­ever, such sup­port is im­por­tant in mit­i­gat­ing the care­giver bur­den.</p>
    <p>One way to help would be to pro­vide train­ing and in­for­ma­tional re­sources about their care re­cip­i­ents’ med­i­cal con­di­tions, es­pe­cially as their needs evolve. Ac­com­pa­ny­ing this, emo­tional sup­port can help to re­duce the work­ers’ fa­tigue from their emo­tional labour and pre­vent burnout.</p>
