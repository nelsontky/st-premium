    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The Bal­ti­more Ravens had at least four dif­fer­ent strains of Covid-19 in their fa­cil­ity dur­ing a ma­jor out­break in­volv­ing 23 play­ers, Dick Cass, the pres­i­dent of the Na­tional Foot­ball League (NFL) team, said on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The Ravens are en­dur­ing one of the big­gest out­breaks of the deadly virus among pro­fes­sional sports teams, one that de­layed their game at the Pitts­burgh Steel­ers for a week and pushed back last week’s game against Dal­las Cow­boys to to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>“With a dan­ger­ous virus like this, ev­ery­one must com­ply with the pro­to­col to avoid in­fect­ing many. We now know that not ev­ery­one at the Ravens fol­lowed the pro­to­col thor­oughly,” Cass said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“Based on i nfor­ma­tion pro­vided by the NFL, we have learnt that we had at least four unique strains of Covid-19 in our fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>“Three of the four were stopped and not spread within our or­gan­i­sa­tion. Un­for­tu­nately, the fourth was a highly con­ta­gious strain and spread through­out our or­gan­i­sa­tion.”</p>
    <p>At least one Ravens player tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 for 10 days in a row. ESPN, cit­ing un­named sources, said a strength and con­di­tion­ing coach was sus­pended for not al­ways wear­ing a mask or con­tact trac­ing de­vice while in the team fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>The Ravens still have 10 play­ers re­main­ing on their Covid-19 re­serve list, in­clud­ing star quar­ter­back La­mar Jack­son.</p>
    <p>At 6-5, Bal­ti­more sit one game be­hind the Mi­ami Dolphins and Indianapol­is Colts for the last play-off spot in the Amer­i­can Con­fer­ence with five games to play. Should they fail to make the post­sea­son, the team will rue their com­pla­cency that has led to a string of ab­sen­tees, Cass ad­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>“To our com­mu­nity, our neigh­bours, our fans and fam­i­lies, we say, ‘Please learn from what hap­pened here’,” he said. “This virus is se­ri­ous. Very se­ri­ous.”</p>
