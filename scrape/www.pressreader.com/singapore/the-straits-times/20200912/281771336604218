    <p>For­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries have taken steps to limit res­i­dents from mix­ing with one another, but these are not fool­proof, say dorm op­er­a­tors who point out that no num­ber of rules will work if peo­ple do not ad­here to them.</p>
    <p>Since the dorms were de­clared clear of Covid-19 a month ago, on Aug 11, an av­er­age of 45 work­ers have tested pos­i­tive for the dis­ease daily, the Health Min­istry dis­closed on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>They were de­tected pri­mar­ily through ac­tive sur­veil­lance test­ing, such as ros­tered rou­tine test­ing (RRT), and ag­gres­sive trac­ing and test­ing when a new case is de­tected.</p>
    <p>The chief ex­ec­u­tive of dor­mi­tory op­er­a­tor Cen­tu­rion, Mr Kong Chee Min, noted that it was pos­si­ble now for work­ers to be in­fected else­where, away from their dorms, be­cause many are spend­ing part of their day out­side fol­low­ing the re­sump­tion of work and the grad­ual re­lax­ation of some restric­tions.</p>
    <p>He called for a co­or­di­nated ef­fort with em­ploy­ers to en­force pre­cau­tions at their work­sites and urged work­ers “to un­der­stand and com­ply with the restric­tions, even as we do our part to ed­u­cate and en­cour­age them in this area”.</p>
    <p>More than 16,000 work­ers cur­rently oc­cupy five Westlite dor­mi­to­ries run by Cen­tu­rion. Two of the dorms re­ported new cases re­cently.</p>
    <p>All five have im­ple­mented var­i­ous mea­sures such as tech­nol­ogy-en­abled doors pro­grammed to open only for res­i­dents of spe­cific blocks or floors, and re­strict­ing res­i­dents to their rooms ex­cept when go­ing to work or for es­sen­tial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>On the new cases, Mr Kong said that the work­ers could have al­ready been in­fected dur­ing ini­tial tests, but they tested neg­a­tive be­cause they were still in the early in­cu­ba­tion stage.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Man­power Tan See Leng also raised this pos­si­bil­ity dur­ing a vir­tual press con­fer­ence on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>When asked if some of the dorm cases had slipped through the tests, Dr Tan re­sponded: “At that par­tic­u­lar point in time, in the cy­cle of the in­cu­ba­tion, we may not have picked up the virus be­cause the man­i­fes­ta­tion of it, the con­cen­tra­tion, has still not reached that level yet.”</p>
    <p>In the light of this, the au­thor­i­ties moved to tighten pro­ce­dures by ros­ter­ing work­ers for test­ing every 14 days. Cur­rently, some 90 per cent of work­ers have been sched­uled for RRT.</p>
    <p>Other mea­sures have also been taken to dis­cour­age co-min­gling in the dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Fences, gates and ded­i­cated routes to com­mon ar­eas and ex­its are now the norm at many of the build­ings. Com­mu­nal fa­cil­i­ties such as cook­ing ar­eas and can­teens have also been fenced up, seg­re­gat­ing them for work­ers stay­ing in dif­fer­ent sec­tions.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, time slots are as­signed for the use of ameni­ties such as su­per­mar­kets, and se­cu­rity of­fi­cers are on duty round the clock to en­force safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Work­ers are grouped by work­sites, and pickup and drop-off times for those head­ing to work are stag­gered to pre­vent crowd­ing, said Dor­mi­tory As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore pres­i­dent Johnathan Cheah.</p>
    <p>Mr Cheah, who is also man­ag­ing direc­tor of S11 Dor­mi­to­ries, which man­ages a to­tal of 19,000 bed spa­ces across three dorms, said the mea­sures were de­signed to “re­duce the in­ter-mix­ing of large groups”. His firm has seen a to­tal of 20 new cases since the all-clear was given.</p>
    <p>At Hulett Dor­mi­tory, move­ment is also strictly con­trolled through fa­cial recog­ni­tion or card ac­cess, said its fa­cil­i­ties man­ager Jack Ng.</p>
    <p>Ded­i­cated lifts serve the dif­fer­ent floors, with each floor separated into var­i­ous wings by a gantry sys­tem.</p>
    <p>The dor­mi­tory has recorded two new Covid-19 cases since it was cleared.</p>
    <p>Still, Mr Ng be­lieves the mea­sures re­main ad­e­quate for now, but said work­ers “need to be ed­u­cated on the im­por­tance of ad­her­ing to them”.</p>
    <p>“Oth­er­wise, no amount of safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures will ever work,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan on Wed­nes­day noted that the au­thor­i­ties had “suc­cess­fully con­tained more than 200 re-emer­gent dor­mi­tory sites” so far. At most of these sites, the num­ber of re-emer­gent in­fec­tions has been low, with fewer than 10 each.</p>
    <p>One dorm op­er­a­tor, who de­clined to be named, had con­cerns how­ever about polic­ing work­ers 24/7 and lim­it­ing their op­por­tu­ni­ties for so­cial in­ter­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>“Some work­ers have al­ready been iso­lated for many months,” said the op­er­a­tor. “We do not want them to feel like they are trapped here.”</p>
    <p>Fences, gates and ded­i­cated routes to com­mon ar­eas and ex­its are now the norm at many of the build­ings.</p>
    <p>Com­mu­nal fa­cil­i­ties such as cook­ing ar­eas and can­teens have also been fenced up, seg­re­gat­ing them for work­ers stay­ing in dif­fer­ent sec­tions.</p>
