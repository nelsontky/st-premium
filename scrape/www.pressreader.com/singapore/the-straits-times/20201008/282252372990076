    <p>• The cost of the coro­n­avirus-post­poned Tokyo Olympics will be slashed by US$280 mil­lion (S$380.6 mil­lion), or­gan­is­ers said yes­ter­day, tout­ing a scaled-back, less flashy Games, with cuts to ev­ery­thing from staffing to py­rotech­nics.</p>
    <p>But the fi­nal cost of next year’s event – of­fi­cially bud­geted be­fore the pan­demic at 1.3 tril­lion yen (S$16.7 bil­lion) – re­mains un­clear be­cause ad­di­tional ex­penses caused by the post­pone­ment have not yet been made pub­lic.</p>
    <p>“Tokyo 2020 be­lieves that this work will help to cre­ate a model for fu­ture global events in­clud­ing forth­com­ing Games amid the new nor­mal in which we now live,” or­gan­is­ers said in a state­ment af­ter a pre­sen­ta­tion to the In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee ex­ec­u­tive board.</p>
    <p>They said they would put out an up­dated bud­get, in­clud­ing ad­di­tional costs linked to post­pone­ment and coro­n­avirus coun­ter­mea­sures, by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>Plans for a lower-key event were un­veiled late last month, with mea­sures in­clud­ing fewer free tick­ets, scrap­ping ath­lete wel­come cer­e­monies, and sav­ings on ban­ners, mas­cots and py­rotech­nics.</p>
    <p>The size of be­hind-the-scenes del­e­ga­tions at the event will be re­duced by 10 to 15 per cent, and perks also cut back, or­gan­is­ers and Olympic of­fi­cials have said.</p>
    <p>The 2020 Games were post­poned ear­lier this year as the coro­n­avirus spread around the globe, and are now set to open on July 23.</p>
    <p>With many coun­tries ex­pe­ri­enc­ing sec­ond or even third waves of in­fec­tion, there have been doubts about whether the event can be staged, but or­gan­is­ers and Olympic of­fi­cials in­sist it can be done safely.</p>
    <p>If held at all, the fi­nal shape of the</p>
    <p>Games re­mains un­clear, with ques­tions over whether to al­low spec­ta­tors and for­eign vis­i­tors yet to be re­solved.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers have made clear that, at the very least, it will be a more sober event com­pared to the usu­ally ex­u­ber­ant spec­ta­cle staged pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>“As we’re in the Covid-19 world, are we in a world where the flashy event that we used to think of as nor­mal be­fore is still suit­able?</p>
    <p>“We’ve reached a turn­ing point in this re­gard,” Tokyo 2020 chief ex­ec­u­tive Toshiro Muto said yes­ter­day.</p>
