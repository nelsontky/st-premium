    <p>NOTH­ING DEF­I­NITE</p>
    <p>Au s t r a l i a ’ s Trade Min­is­ter yes­ter­day called for greater clar­ity from China over re­ports that an em­bargo could hit a slew of in­dus­tries by the end of the week and fur­ther es­ca­late ten­sions be­tween the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Mr Si­mon Birm­ing­ham said he had raised con­cerns with Chi­nese of­fi­cials over sev­eral trade is­sues in­clud­ing in­creased test­ing of live rock lob­sters that “came out of the blue”.</p>
    <p>“There are lots of dif­fer­ent ru­mours and stories at present and it is hard to quite de­fine and dis­cern which things are true, which things are in­flated,” he told Syd­ney ra­dio sta­tion 2GB.</p>
    <p>Although China’s Min­istry of Com­merce had pub­licly de­nied the re­ports of a trade ban, more cer­tainty was needed for Aus­tralian ex­porters, he added.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian wine­mak­ers that have en­joyed a boom­ing de­mand from China’s grow­ing mid­dle-class were also brac­ing them­selves for pos­si­ble tar­iffs. That would add to ten­sions that have al­ready i mpacted beef, bar­ley and coal ex­ports.</p>
    <p>China, Aus­tralia’s big­gest trade part­ner, has threat­ened eco­nomic blow­back on a range of Aus­tralian goods since Canberra called for an in­quiry into the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has al­ready launched a litany of mea­sures this year, in­clud­ing probes into the al­leged dump­ing of Aus­tralian wines, sus­pend­ing beef im­ports, and is­su­ing warn­ings to its cit­i­zens against trav­el­ling to Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Trea­sury Wine Es­tates said that the China Al­co­holic Drinks As­so­ci­a­tion had called on the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment to im­pose ret­ro­spec­tive tar­iffs on some Aus­tralian wine.</p>
    <p>“The re­quest is as­so­ci­ated with the on­go­ing anti-dump­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tion,” the wine­maker said.</p>
    <p>Trea­sury Wine Es­tates said it was un­clear whether the re­quest would be ac­cepted by the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment or if tar­iffs would be ap­plied ret­ro­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>The wine­maker also said it was aware of the “re­ports and spec­u­la­tion” around a larger em­bargo but had not yet re­ceived any no­ti­fi­ca­tion from the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian Fi­nan­cial Re­view, cit­ing un­named sources, said on Mon­day that Chi­nese of­fi­cials met food and wine im­porters last week and warned them not to make new or­ders for Aus­tralian wine and farm prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>What started as a po­lit­i­cal spat be­tween Bei­jing and Canberra has be­come a one-sided trade war that threat­ens se­ri­ous dis­rup­tion for a grow­ing num­ber of Aus­tralian ex­porters.</p>
    <p>The curbs are a ma­jor es­ca­la­tion in Bei­jing’s pres­sure cam­paign fol­low­ing a two-year stand-off over is­sues rang­ing from tech­nol­ogy to the ori­gins of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>China’s black­list – de­liv­ered ver­bally to com­modi­ties traders – also in­cludes sugar and tim­ber. It does not cover ma­te­ri­als such as iron ore and nat­u­ral gas, where im­port curbs could un­duly dam­age China’s own economy.</p>
    <p>“The Chi­nese warned ear­lier this year that many of the goods that Aus­tralia ex­ports were re­place­able,” said se­nior fel­low Richard McGre­gor of Syd­ney-based think­tank Lowy In­sti­tute. “Now they’re go­ing about re­plac­ing them. China seems de­ter­mined to pun­ish Aus­tralia and make it an ex­am­ple to other coun­tries.”</p>
    <p>Coal used to gen­er­ate en­ergy or make steel is the chunki­est of China’s tar­gets. It ac­counted for about 9 per cent of all Aus­tralia’s earn­ings from ex­ports to China last year, far be­hind the big­gest con­trib­u­tor iron ore and a few notches be­low nat­u­ral gas.</p>
    <p>Iron ore is seen as more im­mune from trade ac­tions be­cause China’s sprawl­ing steel sec­tor needs vast quan­ti­ties of Aus­tralia’s high-qual­ity ore.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing prod­ucts now in China’s crosshairs all fall in the “other” cat­e­gory. To­gether, they might ac­count for about 5 per cent of ex­port rev­enues if wheat is in­cluded, based on Bloomberg’s anal­y­sis of Aus­tralian gov­ern­ment data.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing does not seem con­cerned about its richer pop­u­la­tion’s de­mand for Aus­tralian lob­ster or fine wines. For pre­mium wines, China is Aus­tralia’s big­gest buyer, spend­ing al­most A$1.2 bil­lion (S$1.2 bil­lion) in the year through Septem­ber. That is about 2.5 times big­ger than its ex­ports to the United States.</p>
    <p>China said on Tues­day that re­duced im­ports of Aus­tralian prod­ucts were the re­sult of buy­ers’ own de­ci­sions. Asked whether the gov­ern­ment had in­structed im­porters to stop buy­ing Aus­tralian prod­ucts, China’s For­eign Min­istry told Reuters: “Rel­e­vant com­pa­nies re­duc­ing im­ports of rel­e­vant prod­ucts from Aus­tralia are act­ing on their own ini­tia­tive.”</p>
    <p>There are lots of dif­fer­ent ru­mours and stories at present and it is hard to quite de­fine and dis­cern which things are true, which things are in­flated.</p>
