    <p>Views of China, al­ready trend­ing neg­a­tive i n re­cent years, have plunged over the past year across many ad­vanced economies, a new 14-coun­try Pew Re­search Cen­tre sur­vey shows.</p>
    <p>Neg­a­tive views of China in­creased most in Aus­tralia, where 81 per cent now see the coun­try un­favourably, up 24 per­cent­age points since last year. This is in line with a plunge in the China-Aus­tralia re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>In Bri­tain, around three-quar­ters of those polled now see China in a neg­a­tive light – up 19 points from last year.</p>
    <p>And in the United States, neg­a­tive views of China have risen nearly 20 per­cent­age points since Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump took of­fice, an in­crease of 13 points from just last year.</p>
    <p>In Ger­many, the Nether­lands, Swe­den, South Korea, Spain and Canada, neg­a­tive views have reached their high­est points since the cen­tre be­gan polling on this topic more than a decade ago, Pew Re­search said.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey was con­ducted be­tween June 10 and Aug 3, and in­volved 14,276 re­spon­dents. The only Asian coun­tries cov­ered were South Korea and Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic was a key driver of the neg­a­tive sen­ti­ment.</p>
    <p>“Across the 14 na­tions sur­veyed, a me­dian of 61 per cent say China has done a bad job deal­ing with the out­break,” Pew Re­search found.</p>
    <p>“This is many more than say the same of the way the Covid-19 pan­demic was han­dled by their own coun­try or by in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions like the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion or the Euro­pean Union.”</p>
    <p>“Only the US re­ceives more neg­a­tive eval­u­a­tions from the sur­veyed publics, with a me­dian of 84 per cent say­ing the US has han­dled the coro­n­avirus out­break poorly,” Pew Re­search said.</p>
    <p>Dis­ap­proval of how China has han­dled the Covid-19 pan­demic also coloured peo­ple’s con­fi­dence in Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping.</p>
    <p>At least seven in 10 peo­ple in ev­ery coun­try sur­veyed, or a me­dian of 78 per cent across the 14 coun­tries, say they have not too much or no con­fi­dence in him to do the right thing re­gard­ing world af­fairs, Pew Re­search said.</p>
    <p>“This lack of con­fi­dence in (Pres­i­dent) Xi is at his­toric highs in ev­ery coun­try for which trend data is avail­able ex­cept Ja­pan and Spain,” it said.</p>
    <p>“In most coun­tries, the per cent say­ing they have not too much or no con­fi­dence in him has grown by dou­ble dig­its since last year.”</p>
    <p>In the Nether­lands, for in­stance, where around half of re­spon­dents dis­trusted Mr Xi last year, to­day 70 per cent dis­trust him.</p>
    <p>Yet more have faith in Mr Xi than in Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump. In Ger­many, 78 per cent say they have no con­fi­dence in Mr Xi, but 89 per cent say the same of Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi’s global im­age may be some­what bet­ter than Mr Trump’s, but is nonethe­less “sig­nif­i­cantly worse” than that of sev­eral of the other world lead­ers asked about, in­clud­ing Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel, French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron and Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son.</p>
    <p>How­ever, when it comes to per­cep­tions of eco­nomic strength, China fares bet­ter.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple in most coun­tries polled, par­tic­u­larly in Europe, see China as the world’s top econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“Out­side of the US it­self – where 52 per cent of Amer­i­cans say the US is the world’s lead­ing eco­nomic power – only in Ja­pan (53 per cent) and South Korea (77 per cent) do more name the US than China,” the sur­vey found.</p>
    <p>Deep­en­ing the anti-China trend in the US, this is the first year in which more than half of young Amer­i­cans ex­pressed neg­a­tive views to­wards China.</p>
    <p>The only coun­try sur­veyed in which younger peo­ple hold more un­favourable views of China than their elders is South Korea.</p>
