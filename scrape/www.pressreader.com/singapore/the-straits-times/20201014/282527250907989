    <p>• It was a quest wor­thy of a su­per­hero.</p>
    <p>An­i­ma­tor Ra­jiv Chi­laka spent years flog­ging his pitch about a su­per­hu­man In­dian child to Western ex­ec­u­tives – to no avail.</p>
    <p>But to­day, Mighty Lit­tle Bheem is a global hit, as view­ers seek al­ter­na­tives to white-dom­i­nated sto­ry­lines.</p>
    <p>From his mother’s sari to his love of lad­doos, ev­ery­thing about the star tod­dler is In­dian.</p>
    <p>His gi­ant fan base stretches from Seat­tle to Sao Paulo, mak­ing it Net­flix’s most pop­u­lar show for pre-school­ers.</p>
    <p>Since its launch last year, the se­ries has been watched by more than 27 mil­lion house­holds.</p>
    <p>It was Net­flix’s top in­ter­na­tional re­lease of last year in the United States and a third sea­son is now un­der way.</p>
    <p>But the nappy-wear­ing su­per­hero’s jour­ney from the south­ern In­dian city of Hy­der­abad to Hol­ly­wood was not easy.</p>
    <p>“I was thrown out of ev­ery of­fice I went to,” said Chi­laka, who had orig­i­nally ap­proached US tele­vi­sion chan­nels with the hope of tak­ing Ch­hota Bheem (Lit­tle Bheem) – his pop­u­lar In­dian show about a nineyear-old vil­lage boy with su­per­hu­man strength – global.</p>
    <p>TV ex­ec­u­tives de­murred, claim­ing chil­dren in the West would re­ject it be­cause the set­ting was “too bright and colour­ful” and the pro­tag­o­nist was shirt­less, Chi­laka said. “It didn’t re­ally make sense to me. I mean, kids are drawn to colour and Dis­ney made Jun­gle Book – a whole movie about a boy in his un­der­wear – years ago.”</p>
    <p>Al­though US stu­dios reg­u­larly ap­proach In­dian an­i­ma­tors to cre­ate English-lan­guage con­tent at a lower price, the in­dus­try had never won ac­claim for orig­i­nal pro­duc­tions.</p>
    <p>Then Net­flix came call­ing.</p>
    <p>The stream­ing gi­ant wanted to crack In­dia’s mas­sive en­ter­tain­ment mar­ket and hoped a Bheem spin-off, based on a baby ver­sion of Chi­laka’s beloved su­per­hero, would help to do just that.</p>
    <p>NO TRANS­LA­TION NEEDED</p>
    <p>“We re­ally wanted to have a char­ac­ter that res­onated for, first and fore­most, our In­dian mem­bers,” Ms Do­minique Bazay, direc­tor of orig­i­nal an­i­ma­tion for Net­flix, told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>There was no ques­tion of Western­ising the con­tent, she said.</p>
    <p>Bheem wears a tra­di­tional bindi – a dot on the fore­head – and lives in a vil­lage where ev­ery­one is dressed in In­dian cloth­ing.</p>
    <p>Raised by a sin­gle mother, he crawls his way into all kinds of mis­chief, oc­ca­sion­ally in­clud­ing a cheeky mon­key and baby ele­phant in his es­capades.</p>
    <p>The com­pany was not wor­ried about how the show – which has no di­a­logue – would trans­late among over­seas view­ers, Ms Bazay said.</p>
    <p>“Kids are re­ally will­ing to dis­cover (new things) and their cu­rios­ity is bound­less,” she said.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, few ex­pected the ad­ven­tures of Bheem and his furry friends to at­tract such a huge global au­di­ence, as it snapped up fans in the age of Black Pan­ther and the grow­ing de­mand for more di­ver­sity in en­ter­tain­ment.</p>
    <p>New Yorker Lisa-Michelle Houck said her chil­dren, aged four and two, were fast fans of the show.</p>
    <p>Bheem’s fond­ness for lad­doos – a yel­low In­dian sweet – was self­evi­dent to them, she said. “It’s just candy.”</p>
    <p>Bheem’s an­tics – from bang­ing his toy drum non-stop to mak­ing a mess at home – are in­stantly hi­lar­i­ous to young view­ers.</p>
    <p>And, for par­ents seek­ing a break from tra­di­tional kids’ pro­gram­ming and its pa­rade of pink-wear­ing princesses and white pro­tag­o­nists, the show is an easy way to in­tro­duce chil­dren to a more mul­ti­cul­tural world­view.</p>
    <p>Bheem’s sin­gle-par­ent house­hold of­fers im­por­tant lessons on how “there is no one right way to have a fam­ily”, said Ms Houck.</p>
    <p>For Bheem’s cre­ator Chi­laka, the suc­cess has been both stun­ning and sober­ing.</p>
    <p>“When we started work, I was very con­scious that this was the first an­i­mated show from In­dia to find such a large plat­form,” the 46-year-old said.</p>
    <p>“It was a big load on my shoul­ders, be­cause I knew it could open doors for oth­ers.”</p>
    <p>Bheem’s jour­ney from un­der­dog to global phe­nom­e­non could prove a game-changer for In­dia’s an­i­ma­tion in­dus­try, he added.</p>
    <p>It has al­ready trans­formed the for­tunes of Chi­laka’s stu­dio, Green Gold An­i­ma­tion, which has seen its staff num­bers shoot up from 25 to around 1,200 peo­ple based in In­dia, the US, Sin­ga­pore and the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>“We are still pinch­ing our­selves,” Chi­laka said, adding that he hopes to pro­duce a movie about the tod­dler at some point.</p>
    <p>“This lit­tle kid has turned my life up­side down.”</p>
