    <p>Over the 26 years of his pres­i­dency, Mr Alek­sandr Lukashenko sailed through elec­tions mostly with­out much ado. With a tight grip on any op­po­si­tion and mod­est but stable eco­nomic fig­ures back­ing him up, the Pres­i­dent of Be­larus had the po­lit­i­cal sit­u­a­tion un­der con­trol. But this is no longer so.</p>
    <p>For the first time in his reign, Mr Lukashenko, 65, is be­ing se­ri­ously chal­lenged at the polls.</p>
    <p>La­belled “Europe’s last dic­ta­tor­ship”, Be­larus, sand­wiched be­tween the EU and Rus­sia, is fac­ing ten­sions of a mag­ni­tude it has not ex­pe­ri­enced be­fore.</p>
    <p>Un­afraid of reper­cus­sions, Be­laru­sians are tak­ing to the streets and voic­ing their dis­con­tent. Last week, a rally at­tracted tens of thou­sands who gath­ered in the cap­i­tal Minsk – an ex­tra­or­di­nary event for a cit­i­zenry well known for its pa­tience and sto­icism.</p>
    <p>Although Pres­i­dent Lukashenko has banned the most promis­ing op­po­si­tion con­tenders from tak­ing part in the Aug 9 elec­tion, he is now con­fronted with a trio of fe­male politi­cians who have gath­ered around can­di­date Svet­lana Tikhanousk­aya – and the three are get­ting more pop­u­lar by the day.</p>
    <p>As a sign of his in­creas­ing ner­vous­ness, Mr Lukashenko has now even paved the way for a pos­si­ble dec­la­ra­tion of a state of emer­gency or a de­lay­ing of the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>A few days ago, he ac­cused al­leged Rus­sian mer­ce­nar­ies of in­fil­trat­ing the coun­try and plan­ning ter­ror­ist at­tacks. Whether those al­le­ga­tions are true or just an­other at­tempt to even­tu­ally make peo­ple rally around a pres­i­dent who wants to be seen as fend­ing off an ex­ter­nal threat re­mains to be seen.</p>
    <p>For the Euro­pean Union, de­vel­op­ments in Be­larus are highly del­i­cate. They bring back mem­o­ries of events in neigh­bour­ing Ukraine in 2013 and 2014, when the coun­try tried to align it­self closer to the EU but had to change course be­cause of Rus­sian pres­sure.</p>
    <p>This led to the oust­ing of the Moscow-friendly gov­ern­ment of Vik­tor Yanukovych, the sub­se­quent an­nex­a­tion of the Crimea by Rus­sia and civil war in Eastern Ukraine.</p>
    <p>With re­gard to Be­larus, ob­servers are con­vinced that Moscow will do what­ever it can to pre­vent a sim­i­lar course of events in Minsk.</p>
    <p>Be­larus as­sumed in­de­pen­dence af­ter the col­lapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. How­ever, be­cause of its long his­tory as part of Rus­sia, Moscow con­sid­ers it to be a nat­u­ral part of its sphere of in­flu­ence.</p>
    <p>Talks over a merger or an as­so­ci­a­tion with Rus­sia were held, but never con­cluded. Eco­nom­i­cally, Mr Lukashenko’s Be­larus is highly de­pen­dent on Moscow. Al­most 60 per cent of its im­ports ar­rive from Rus­sia, with oil and gas ac­count­ing for the bulk of the trade. Ex­ports from Be­larus go to Rus­sia but also more and more to the EU.</p>
    <p>As a tran­sit coun­try for Rus­sian gas de­liv­er­ies to Western mar­kets, Be­larus has sig­nif­i­cant geostrate­gic im­por­tance for Moscow.</p>
    <p>Mr Lukashenko, who un­der com­mu­nism was a di­rec­tor of an agri­cul­tural farm, has lost much of his sup­port even in the ru­ral ar­eas of the coun­try through his poor han­dling of the coro­n­avirus cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Down­play­ing the im­pact of the virus and mak­ing light of coun­ter­mea­sures – the Pres­i­dent pub­licly rec­om­mended the drink­ing of vodka and op­er­at­ing a trac­tor on the field to fight the dis­ease – he did not take se­ri­ously the con­cerns of the peo­ple of Be­larus.</p>
    <p>Although the of­fi­cial num­bers of coro­n­avirus-re­lated deaths are low (be­low 600), the es­ti­mated num­bers are much higher.</p>
    <p>But Covid-19 is seen as just the spark un­leash­ing open dis­sat­is­fac­tion with the Pres­i­dent that had built up over the past years. Although, im­me­di­ately af­ter events in</p>
    <p>Ukraine in 2014, Mr Lukashenko was judged much more pos­i­tively – as a sta­bil­is­ing fac­tor en­sur­ing in­de­pen­dence from Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>His bal­anc­ing act with the dom­i­nant neigh­bour in the east went mod­estly well and so did – at least for some time – the over­all eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion for Be­laru­sians.</p>
    <p>In re­turn, the peo­ple of Be­larus seemed to be will­ing to pay a price for this by giv­ing up on their po­lit­i­cal free­doms.</p>
    <p>But the fac­tors that en­abled the suc­cess of the past are no longer in play. Ac­cord­ing to a World Bank re­port, cap­i­tal ac­cu­mu­la­tion in the coun­try, which was the main driver for the suc­cess, has been ex­hausted. Even be­fore Covid-19 struck, growth was al­ready down to zero and ex­pected to con­tract fur­ther, a far cry from the 5 per cent it had chalked up in early 2018.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, en­ergy sub­si­dies from Rus­sia are lower than they used to be, thus in­creas­ing the debt bur­den of Be­larus. With the coun­try ne­glect­ing to di­ver­sify its en­ergy im­port struc­ture, com­pa­nies have started com­plain­ing.</p>
    <p>But the more un­pleas­ant the eco­nomic news, the more Mr</p>
    <p>Lukashenko has tight­ened his hold on the reins of po­lit­i­cal power.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cial state broad­cast­ers BT and ONT are cel­e­brat­ing the Pres­i­dent as the benev­o­lent fa­ther of the nation while se­cu­rity forces are crack­ing down on crit­i­cal voices. This is even eas­ier to do in a so­ci­ety where 70 per cent of eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity is con­trolled by the state and em­ploy­ees can be closely mon­i­tored. Ob­servers are also afraid that Mr Lukashenko will forge elec­tion re­sults on a large scale.</p>
    <p>With no po­lit­i­cal heir in sight, Mr Lukashenko seems to have no other op­tion than to cling to his of­fice.</p>
    <p>“Mr Lukashenko’s idea was to split us all and to de­stroy us one by one, and he re­ally did that,” Mr Valery Tspekalo, a lead­ing op­po­si­tion fig­ure now in Rus­sian ex­ile, said re­cently.</p>
    <p>But things have changed. The Pres­i­dent “couldn’t ex­pect that we would be able to or­gan­ise be­hind one per­son who ap­pears to be for Be­larus so­ci­ety a sym­bol, like the sym­bol of the French re­sis­tance move­ment Joan of Arc”, said Mr Tspekalo of Ms Tikhanousk­aya.</p>
