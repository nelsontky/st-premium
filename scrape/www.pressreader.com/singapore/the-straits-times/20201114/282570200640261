    <p>Group 1 Sin­ga­pore Derby-Queen El­iz­a­beth II Cup win­ner Top Knight will pro­ceed to next Satur­day’s $1 mil­lion Group 1 Sin­ga­pore Gold Cup over 2,000m.</p>
    <p>As the high­est-rated en­try on 103 points, the Fal­con Rac­ing No. 7 Rac­ing Sta­ble-owned gal­loper will take pride of place in the third and fi­nal leg of the Sin­ga­pore Triple Crown se­ries.</p>
    <p>Only two horses are rated higher than Top Knight. But Count of mon­te­cristo (114) will be sent to Aus­tralia for a break af­ter his un­placed run in the Queen El­iz­a­beth II Cup, while Jupiter Gold (104) is just mak­ing a come­back in the Group 2 EW Barker Tro­phy to­day, af­ter a long drawn-out bat­tle with in­jury.</p>
    <p>Trainer Michael Cle­ments had said af­ter the Queen El­iz­a­beth II Cup vic­tory on Oct 31 that the Gold Cup would ap­pear to be a log­i­cal op­tion to con­sider. But Top Knight would be close to car­ry­ing top weight on his rat­ings.</p>
    <p>“The Gold Cup is al­ways a hard race for any horse run­ning against younger horses who carry only 50kg,” he added then.</p>
    <p>While the con­nec­tions have weighed in on the Gold Cup, Top Knight could still opt out, in favour of a shot at the pres­ti­gious Hong Kong In­ter­na­tional Races (HKIR) on Dec 13, in par­tic­u­lar the Group 1 Hong Kong Mile over 1,600m.</p>
    <p>Cle­ments and Fal­con Rac­ing Sta­ble had been keen on the HKIR since the Sin­ga­pore Derby suc­cess in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, the Hong Kong Jockey Club ad­vised the Zim­babwe-born trainer that his charge was a re­serve for the HK$20 mil­lion (S$3.5 mil­lion) Hong Kong Mile at this stage.</p>
    <p>While a re­sponse from Hong Kong was nec­es­sary to con­sider the op­tions, Cle­ments re­vealed that was not the trig­ger to def­i­nitely run the five-year-old son of Zous­tar in the Gold Cup.</p>
    <p>“We also en­tered Top Knight for the Hong Kong Cup (2,000m). But, at this point in time, he’s a re­serve run­ner for the Hong Kong Mile,” said Cle­ments.</p>
    <p>“I un­der­stand the Hong Kong Jockey Club is await­ing con­fir­ma­tion from horses rated ahead of him be­fore fi­nal­is­ing the list. At this stage, we’re 50/50 to run, we won’t know un­til the list of run­ners is dis­sem­i­nated on Nov 25.</p>
    <p>“Re­gard­less, it was al­ways the plan to run him in the Gold Cup. It’s a one-mil­lion-dol­lar race and he’s been go­ing good on a wet track.</p>
    <p>“It’ll be his first time over 2,000m, but there is no rea­son why he can’t get the trip. The Gold Cup has al­ways been his main goal. If he gets in the Hong Kong Mile as well, it’s all well and good.”</p>
