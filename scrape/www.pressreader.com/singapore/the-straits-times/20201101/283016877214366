    <p>It is al­most 20 years since Brazil­born striker Eg­mar Gon­calves be­came the Lions’ first im­ported player in 2002, and a decade has passed since Chi­nese for­ward Qiu</p>
    <p>Li be­came the last of nine play­ers the Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (FAS) adopted un­der the For­eign Sports Tal­ent (FST) scheme.</p>
    <p>But South Korean mid­fielder</p>
    <p>Song Ui-young’s suc­cess­ful per­ma­nent res­i­dency ap­pli­ca­tion – sup­ported by Sport Sin­ga­pore and the FAS – and his stated de­sire to be­come a Lion have raised the prospect of the dor­mant pro­gramme be­ing re­vived as the Repub­lic aims to qual­ify for the 2034 World Cup.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to queries from The</p>
    <p>Sun­day Times, an FAS spokesman said it re­mains open to the pos­si­bil­ity of in­te­grat­ing nat­u­ralised play­ers into the na­tional teams to achieve its mid-to-long term goals.</p>
    <p>For­mer na­tional coach Rado­jko Avramovic, who won three Asean Foot­ball Cham­pi­onships in 2004, 2007 and 2012, was able to call up nat­u­ralised play­ers who hailed from Eng­land, Nige­ria, Ser­bia and China dur­ing his ten­ure and de­fended his selections.</p>
    <p>The Serb, 70, told The Sun­day Times: “It would be wrong to fo­cus just on the FST scheme, as ev­ery coun­try needs to de­velop its own foot­ball tal­ents.</p>
    <p>“But it has be­come an ac­cept­able prac­tice in world foot­ball to adopt tal­ents from dif­fer­ent coun­tries. So, if they can adapt and con­trib­ute, then why not do the same with Sin­ga­pore foot­ball?”</p>
    <p>Re­gional ri­vals In­done­sia field the likes of Mon­tene­grin-born striker Ilija Spa­so­je­vic, who de­buted in 2017, while Malaysia also nat­u­ralised Gam­bi­aborn winger Mo­hamadou Su­mareh in 2018.</p>
    <p>For Sin­ga­pore cap­tain Hariss Harun, 29, where his team­mates were born was never an is­sue.</p>
    <p>The mid­fielder said: “It wasn’t easy be­cause I was up against play­ers like Fahrudin Mustafic. But the com­pe­ti­tion helped be­cause I stepped up and raised my game – and it’s the same for many other lo­cal­born play­ers – and the over­all stan­dard was lifted.</p>
    <p>“The nat­u­ralised play­ers con­trib­uted to our suc­cess at Asean level and we al­most qual­i­fied for the 2011 Asian Cup for the first time. In the dress­ing room, we also bonded well and had a lot of fun as a team.”</p>
    <p>For­mer na­tional de­fender R. Sasiku­mar, who was part of an all-Sin­ga­pore-born team who won the 1998 Tiger Cup, re­mains un­con­vinced by the mer­its of FST.</p>
    <p>The 45-year-old said: “What the for­eign tal­ents did was just make us kam­pung he­roes by win­ning the Suzuki Cup. They didn’t take us to the Asian Cup, the next level, which was what they should have done.”</p>
    <p>He also urged the au­thor­i­ties to look at play­ers in pri­vate youth leagues here in­stead of seek­ing out older foot­ballers who may qual­ify un­der the FST scheme.That was one of the mis­takes of past ad­min­is­tra­tions, noted for­mer Sin­ga­pore coach and tech­ni­cal di­rec­tor P. N. Si­vaji, 69.</p>
    <p>He added: “Back then, there was this be­lief FST would work in tan­dem with a good youth de­vel­op­ment pro­gramme, where younger play­ers will get qual­ity train­ing and play reg­u­larly in com­pet­i­tive lo­cal youth leagues and in­ter­na­tional com­pe­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>“Then af­ter a few years, the for­eign tal­ent may leave, and the young play­ers would step in... How­ever, some­where along the way it didn’t hap­pen.”</p>
    <p>In fact, there has been a drop in stan­dards. The Lions have not won the Asean Cham­pi­onship since 2012, while their Fifa rank­ings slipped from 92nd in 2005 to 172nd in 2017. They are now ranked 158th.</p>
    <p>But relook­ing the FST pro­gramme can be com­pli­cated. A vet­eran ob­server, who de­clined to be named, high­lighted how its first two nat­u­ralised play­ers – Gon­calves and Mirko Grabo­vac – re­nounced their Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zen­ship in 2007 and 2008 re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong told ST the scheme re­mains an op­tion, but any de­ci­sion will not be based purely on sport­ing abil­i­ties. He said: “With our struc­tures in place now with Sport Sin­ga­pore, Sin­ga­pore Sport In­sti­tute, Sin­ga­pore Sports School, our fo­cus on the com­mu­nity, par­tic­i­pa­tion grad­u­at­ing into na­tional youth squads... there might be less need to lean on such pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>“I want nat­u­ral lo­cal tal­ents com­ing out of schools to grad­u­ate into elite sports, that ought to be the ob­jec­tive. My own view on how we bring in for­eign tal­ent is we must first en­sure this per­son is some­body you would ac­cept as a nat­u­ralised Sin­ga­porean, whether he’s a sports­man or not. The fore­most con­sid­er­a­tion must still be one of na­tional in­ter­ests and iden­tity.”</p>
