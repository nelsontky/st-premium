    <p>•</p>
    <p>For many marginalis­ed eth­nic mi­nor­ity groups in con­flict­plagued re­gions of Myan­mar, next month’s na­tional elec­tions had at least of­fered a glim­mer of hope for em­pow­er­ment.</p>
    <p>But a de­ci­sion to ex­clude swathes of their home­land from the vote – osten­si­bly over se­cu­rity con­cerns – has in­stead filled them with anger and de­spair, with nearly two mil­lion peo­ple now dis­en­fran­chised.</p>
    <p>Ms Aung San Suu Kyi’s rul­ing Na­tional League for Democ­racy (NLD) is widely ex­pected to be re­turned to power in the Nov 8 polls – only the sec­ond since the coun­try emerged from out­right mil­i­tary rule. But the party faces wan­ing sup­port in many eth­nic mi­nor­ity ar­eas, where dis­con­tent has now in­ten­si­fied.</p>
    <p>Two weeks ago, the elec­tion com­mis­sion an­nounced a long list of con­stituen­cies where vot­ing will not take place, leav­ing dis­en­fran­chised more than a mil­lion in Rakhine and hun­dreds of thou­sands more else­where.</p>
    <p>“This is dev­as­tat­ing,” said Mr Hla Maung Oo, an eth­nic Rakhine and head of one of many camps for dis­placed peo­ple in his state. “I’m de­pressed by the de­ci­sion, be­cause I knew whom I was go­ing to vote for from the be­gin­ning.”</p>
    <p>Ten­sions in Rakhine were high even be­fore the move. A civil war be­tween the Myan­mar mil­i­tary and the Arakan Army (AA) – a mil­i­tant group fight­ing for more au­ton­omy for the eth­nic Rakhine – has killed and wounded hun­dreds and forced 200,000 from their homes.</p>
    <p>Both sides stand ac­cused of abuses, but the AA still en­joys wide­spread sup­port from a peo­ple who have long felt marginalis­ed by the ma­jor­ity Ba­mar in one of the na­tion’s poor­est states.</p>
    <p>One com­mu­nity in Rakhine state was no­tably un­af­fected by this lat­est de­ci­sion, but only be­cause they were al­ready dis­en­fran­chised.</p>
    <p>Myan­mar’s Ro­hingya Mus­lims have had their cit­i­zen­ship and rights stripped away over decades.</p>
    <p>A bru­tal mil­i­tary crack­down in 2017 forced 750,000 to flee to refugee camps in Bangladesh – vi­o­lence that now sees Myan­mar fac­ing geno­cide charges at the United Na­tions’ top court.</p>
    <p>But 600,000 more Ro­hingya still live in Myan­mar, mostly in Rakhine state, liv­ing un­der what rights groups have de­scribed as a system of apartheid.</p>
    <p>“We had no hope be­fore, and we still have no hope,” Mr Saw Aung, a Ro­hingya from Min­bya town­ship, told Agence France-Presse by phone.</p>
    <p>“Even if the elec­tions were held, our sit­u­a­tion would not im­prove.”</p>
    <p>In to­tal, nearly two mil­lion peo­ple of vot­ing age – about 5 per cent of the elec­torate – will now be un­able to cast a bal­lot.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple in other states across the coun­try – no­tably in Shan, Kachin and Karen – have also been left reel­ing by the an­nounce­ment.</p>
    <p>Kachin State Peo­ple’s Party MP Dwe Bu ac­cused the gov­ern­ment of let­ting down eth­nic mi­nori­ties.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieved the NLD gov­ern­ment would strive for democ­racy and work for the pub­lic,” she said.</p>
    <p>“But now, I feel they’re even worse.”</p>
    <p>The NLD de­nied claims that it had in­ter­fered, while the elec­tion com­mis­sion last week tried to de­flect the blame, stat­ing all vot­ing can­cel­la­tions had been de­cided in con­sul­ta­tion with the gov­ern­ment, in­clud­ing two mil­i­tary-con­trolled min­istries.</p>
    <p>Re­gard­less of who made the de­ci­sion, Mr Htoi Aung – forced from his home by fight­ing be­tween the mil­i­tary and Kachin rebels – will be among the many un­able to vote next month.</p>
    <p>“Our peo­ple have lost their rights and our eth­nic party will no longer be able to win.”</p>
