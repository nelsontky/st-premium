    <p>Kim Lim, daugh­ter of bil­lion­aire busi­ness­man Peter Lim, di­vorced her hus­band this year af­ter more than three years. The two had tied the knot in a low-pro­file cer­e­mony at­tended by fam­ily in 2016 and had their son the fol­low­ing year.</p>
    <p>Her re­la­tion­ship with her hus­band has been on and off in the past year, and their love had turned into a “habit” with­out spark.</p>
    <p>“In­stead of forc­ing our­selves to sur­vive in an un­happy mar­riage, it’s bet­ter to give each other free­dom,” she says.</p>
    <p>“We had al­ready sep­a­rated about a year ago, so this is not a rash de­ci­sion. Though we can­not be hus­band and wife, he is still the fa­ther of my son and a very good one at that.”</p>
    <p>Since Lim, 29, sep­a­rated from BK Kho at the end of last year, she has been liv­ing with her fa­ther and her step­mother Cherie, which has brought them closer.</p>
    <p>Lim and Kho also make it a point to at­tend the Chi­nese New Year char­ity events for Cherie Lim’s char­ity Op­er­a­tion Red­shirt, as well as their son’s birth­day to­gether.</p>
    <p>She re­veals that her for­mer hus­band has al­ways been a quiet man and that when she brought up di­vorce, he was silent. He keeps a low pro­file and not much is known about him – so much so that when her friend Cris­tiano Ron­aldo vis­ited her in the hos­pi­tal when she gave birth, ne­ti­zens thought the football star was her baby’s fa­ther.</p>
    <p>Lim de­nies that her par­ents’ lengthy and bit­ter di­vorce caused her to dis­trust the in­sti­tu­tion of mar­riage. She says she had given her failed re­la­tion­ship many chances, but felt they were drag­ging each other down at the end.</p>
    <p>When Lim spoke to Icon in 2018, she said the cou­ple led com­pletely dif­fer­ent lives. She is loud where he is quiet, she loves fash­ion where he dresses sim­ply, she likes sashimi but he eats only cooked food; she is an in­flu­encer but he does not like so­cial me­dia. She said then that these were only dif­fer­ences and not con­flicts, and that they had found a way to live har­mo­niously to­gether.</p>
    <p>Lim is now fo­cus­ing on her ca­reer, piv­ot­ing from in­flu­encer to the aes­thetic medicine business. “I still love fash­ion, but I hope to have my own ca­reer,” she says.</p>
    <p>Though she is fa­mil­iar with the in­dus­try as a cus­tomer, she was new to the man­age­ment side and got an in­sider to be her business part­ner when she de­cided to ven­ture into the scene last year.</p>
    <p>She was in­volved in the en­tire business plan­ning process and opened Papilla Hair­care at Ngee Ann City and Il­lu­mia Ther­a­peu­tics in Whee­lock Place last year.</p>
    <p>“The most un­for­get­table thing is that be­fore Papilla opened, the ren­o­va­tion works could not be done on time, so the en­tire staff stayed back to clean and do the fi­nal prepa­ra­tion work un­til five in the morn­ing,” she says.</p>
    <p>The two es­tab­lish­ments have 23 em­ploy­ees, all about 30 years old. The heiress is the youngest on the team. She is at the two clin­ics six days a week and rests on Sun­days when the clin­ics are closed.</p>
    <p>When faced with un­rea­son­able cus­tomers, she says she can now main­tain a pos­i­tive at­ti­tude. “I feel that I am much more re­silient now.”</p>
    <p>Though her fa­ther owns the Thom­son Med­i­cal health­care business, her clin­ics are not parked un­der it.</p>
    <p>“I want to start a brand with my own ca­pa­bil­i­ties. I told my dad when I was 18 that I wanted to start an aes­thetic business, but he didn’t take it very se­ri­ously then. So I de­cided to give my­self a chal­lenge and do every­thing on my own, and learn and grow from the ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>In Lim’s eyes, her fa­ther is dot­ing yet strict. He does not speak much, but has high ex­pec­ta­tions of his chil­dren.</p>
    <p>She says that she once ex­cit­edly shared her clin­ics’ en­cour­ag­ing open­ing sales with him, but he told her: “This is just tem­po­rary. Ul­ti­mately, it is about how you con­tinue to do.”</p>
    <p>Lim was dis­ap­pointed, but un­der­stood this was her fa­ther’s way of mo­ti­vat­ing her.</p>
    <p>She had hoped to ex­pand her business to Malaysia, In­done­sia and Viet­nam and start her own hair-care line, but Covid-19 put a span­ner in the works, with cir­cuit breaker mea­sures re­quir­ing her clin­ics here to close.</p>
    <p>Lim felt down dur­ing the shut-in pe­riod and talked to her col­leagues about what could be done to raise mo­rale. She then de­cided to de­liver food to front-line med­i­cal staff in hos­pi­tals and those test­ing dor­mi­tory work­ers.</p>
    <p>With so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures re­laxed in phase two, Lim has re­turned to her nor­mal pace of work. Though run­ning her own business is tough, she says with a smile: “I re­gret not chas­ing this dream of mine ear­lier.”</p>
    <p>In July last year, Kim Lim’s for­mer hus­band Kho Bin Kai was charged in court with as­sist­ing in re­mote gam­bling. Kho, who turns 30 at the end of this month, was re­ported to be out on $25,000 bail last year and the out­come of the case is pend­ing.</p>
