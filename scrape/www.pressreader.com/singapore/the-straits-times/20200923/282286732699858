    <p>The fi­nan­cial woes of two large and prom­i­nent lo­cal com­pa­nies are stir­ring con­cerns about the over­all health of cor­po­rate Malaysia – par­tic­u­larly debt-laden pub­licly listed en­ti­ties – amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The prob­lems fac­ing casino ty­coon Lim Kok Thay – Malaysia’s rich­est busi­ness­man – of the Gent­ing group, and record losses at na­tional oil com­pany Petro­liam Na­sional, or Petronas – the coun­try’s rich­est en­tity and its sole For­tune 500 list­ing – sug­gest com­pa­nies in Malaysia that are heavy on debt and light on cash could be in for some chal­leng­ing months if the in­ter­na­tional eco­nomic out­look does not pick up.</p>
    <p>State sup­port, par­tic­u­larly over the mora­to­rium for cor­po­rates and house­holds to ser­vice their bank bor­row­ings, will be with­drawn by the end of this month, and this is set to have dev­as­tat­ing ef­fects for the wider Malaysian econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Mr Manu Bhaskaran, re­gional strate­gist of Cen­ten­nial Group, ar­gues that a num­ber of other fac­tors must come to­gether for pol­i­cy­mak­ers to de­sign a soft land­ing for an econ­omy al­ready in re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>“Gov­ern­ment sup­port in the form of the mora­to­rium on loans needs to be phased out over time and not done abruptly. Also, banks need to be prac­ti­cal when dealing with bor­row­ers, be­cause pulling the plug on one (bor­rower) can have a dan­ger­ous knock-on ef­fect,” he said.</p>
    <p>There is a gen­eral con­sen­sus among econ­o­mists and bankers that busi­ness clo­sures in the ser­vice econ­omy will lead to wide­spread lay­offs i n the com­ing months, piling fur­ther strain on house­hold debt, which, at nearly 83 per cent to gross do­mes­tic prod­uct, is al­ready among the high­est in Asia.</p>
    <p>But how the fall­out will hit Malaysia’s cor­po­rate sec­tor is pro­vok­ing de­bate.</p>
    <p>The op­ti­mistic view among bankers and in­vest­ment an­a­lysts is that it will be lim­ited be­cause the ma­jor­ity of the coun­try’s pub­licly listed com­pa­nies are bet­ter cap­i­talised and its banks are i n a stronger po­si­tion than they were dur­ing the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis more than two decades ago, when re­gional cur­ren­cies were ham­mered down by spec­u­la­tors, send­ing economies into a tail­spin.</p>
    <p>But long-term watch­ers of the Malaysian econ­omy ar­gue that the prob­lems fac­ing Mr Lim’s Gent­ing and the losses at Petronas in­di­cate that the chal­lenges fac­ing both the gov­ern­ment and the pri­vate sec­tor are hugely dif­fer­ent and more daunt­ing this time around.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim stunned in­vestors last month when cruise op­er­a­tor Gent­ing Hong Kong, a listed en­tity he per­son­ally con­trols close to 80 per cent of, de­clared it would sus­pend all pay­ments to cred­i­tors be­cause of se­ri­ous im­pair­ments in its busi­ness, which has been bat­tered by in­ter­na­tional lock­downs that forced the clo­sure of its casi­nos and re­sorts world­wide.</p>
    <p>While Gent­ing’s busi­nesses in Malaysia and Sin­ga­pore are weather­ing the rough eco­nomic head­winds, an­a­lysts fear the group’s health­ier units could be tapped to bail out Gent­ing Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Petronas, which posted a quar­terly net loss of RM21 bil­lion (S$6.9 bil­lion) for the pe­riod ended June 30 against a profit of RM14.7 bil­lion in the same quar­ter last year, played a key role in re­pair­ing the econ­omy dur­ing the cri­sis in the late 1990s.</p>
    <p>The na­tional oil com­pany also spear­headed the devel­op­ment of the coun­try’s ad­min­is­tra­tive cap­i­tal Pu­tra­jaya dur­ing the cri­sis years, and this was vi­tal in boost­ing a slump­ing con­struc­tion sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mists noted that the gov­ern­ment’s re­liance on Petronas to pro­vide fi­nan­cial life­lines for trou­bled com­pa­nies and the gen­eral econ­omy will be lim­ited this time round.</p>
    <p>The mas­sive debt of other large, state-owned in­vest­ment com­pa­nies is also likely to limit the gov­ern­ment’s abil­ity to carry out bailouts.</p>
    <p>Lead­ing the pack is Khaz­anah Hold­ings, the state-owned strate­gic fund that owns com­mand­ing stakes in many of the coun­try’s largest com­pa­nies, such as power util­ity Te­naga Na­sional, wire­less telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions op­er­a­tor Ax­i­ata Group, telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions gi­ant Telekom Malaysia and prop­erty group UEM Sun­rise.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies in the Khaz­anah sta­ble had a net debt po­si­tion of RM57.6 bil­lion as at the end of March, ac­cord­ing to pub­lished ac­counts.</p>
    <p>Other state-owned in­vest­ment en­ti­ties with com­mand­ing in­ter­ests in pub­lic listed en­ti­ties are Per­modalan Na­sional (PNB) and the coun­try’s armed forces pen­sion fund, or Lem­baga Tabung Angkatan Ten­tera (LTAT).</p>
    <p>PNB groups of com­pa­nies, which in­clude con­glom­er­ate Sime Darby, auto and en­gi­neer­ing gi­ant UMW and com­pa­nies in­volved in phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals, prop­erty devel­op­ment and man­u­fac­tur­ing, posted a com­bined net debt of RM23.8 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The net debt po­si­tion of LTAT com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing the di­ver­si­fied Boustead Group, stood at RM7.8 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Se­nior gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials ac­knowl­edge that the debt of many gov­ern­ment-linked en­ti­ties is large be­cause of cor­po­rate ex­pan­sion over the last decade. But they re­main upbeat that the strain will not lead to any ma­jor fall­out.</p>
    <p>Long-term watch­ers of the Malaysian econ­omy ar­gue that the prob­lems fac­ing Gent­ing and the losses at Petronas in­di­cate that the chal­lenges fac­ing both the gov­ern­ment and the pri­vate sec­tor are hugely dif­fer­ent and more daunt­ing this time around.</p>
