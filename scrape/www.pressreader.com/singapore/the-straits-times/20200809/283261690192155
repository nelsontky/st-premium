    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power noted that the as­sess­ment by the Mel­bourne Mer­cer Global Pen­sion In­dex of the Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) sys­tem may not have cov­ered all as­pects of the scheme here.</p>
    <p>“As with many such stud­ies, the method­olo­gies may not take into full ac­count the unique fea­tures of each sys­tem,” it said. “We note the study has iden­ti­fied three ar­eas which would have led to a higher score for Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Those ar­eas are tack­led here:</p>
    <p>1. Re­duce bar­ri­ers to es­tab­lish tax-ap­proved group cor­po­rate re­tire­ment plans</p>
    <p>MOM: Em­ploy­ers can al­ready sup­ple­ment the re­tire­ment sav­ings of their Sin­ga­porean em­ploy­ees via the CPF Re­tire­ment Sum Top­ping-Up Scheme (RSTU) and the Sup­ple­men­tary Re­tire­ment Scheme (SRS). These schemes have some ad­van­tages over cor­po­rate re­tire­ment plans: • Con­tri­bu­tions to the CPF and</p>
    <p>SRS are fully por­ta­ble;</p>
    <p>• By tap­ping the CPF and SRS, em­ploy­ers need not in­cur ex­tra costs to man­age their own sys­tems;</p>
    <p>• Em­ploy­ers who make cash</p>
    <p>top-ups through RSTU to their em­ploy­ees’ CPF will ben­e­fit from an equiv­a­lent amount of tax de­duc­tions for their top-ups; and</p>
    <p>• Un­der the Matched Re­tire­ment Sav­ings Scheme, cash top-ups via RSTU to el­i­gi­ble CPF mem­bers with lower bal­ances (in­clud­ing em­ployer top-ups to em­ploy­ees) will be matched dol­lar for dol­lar by the Gov­ern­ment, up to an an­nual cap of $600, to help the re­cip­i­ents boost their re­tire­ment ad­e­quacy.</p>
    <p>2. Open CPF to non-res­i­dents</p>
    <p>MOM: We do not ex­tend the CPF sys­tem to for­eign­ers be­cause they are not ex­pected to re­tire in Sin­ga­pore and may al­ready be par­tic­i­pat­ing in pen­sion schemes in their home coun­tries.</p>
    <p>In any case, for­eign­ers who wish to save for their re­tire­ment may do so through the SRS which con­fers a tax ben­e­fit.</p>
    <p>3. In­crease the age at which CPF mem­bers can ac­cess their re­tire­ment sav­ings</p>
    <p>MOM: While CPF Life monthly pay­outs can be­gin as early as 65, mem­bers can de­fer them un­til 70.</p>
    <p>Their monthly pay­outs will in­crease by up to 7 per cent for every year of de­fer­ral.</p>
