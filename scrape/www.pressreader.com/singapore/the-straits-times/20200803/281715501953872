    <p>CHICAGO • First, the Pa­cific North­west and the north-east were hit hard­est as the coro­n­avirus tore through the nation.</p>
    <p>Then, it surged across the south. Now, the virus is again pick­ing up dan­ger­ous speed in much of the Mid­west – and in states from Mis­sis­sippi to Florida to Cal­i­for­nia that thought they had al­ready seen the worst of it.</p>
    <p>As the United States rides what amounts to a se­cond wave of cases, with daily new in­fec­tions lev­el­ling off at an alarm­ing higher mark, there is a deep­en­ing na­tional sense that the progress made in fight­ing the pan­demic is com­ing un­done and that no patch of Amer­ica is safe.</p>
    <p>In Mis­souri, Wis­con­sin and Illi­nois, dis­tressed gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials are retight­en­ing re­stric­tions on res­i­dents and busi­nesses, and sound­ing warn­ings about a surge in coro­n­avirus­re­lated hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>In the south and the west, sev­eral states are re­port­ing their high­est lev­els of new Covid-19 cases, with out­breaks over­whelm­ing ur­ban and ru­ral ar­eas alike.</p>
    <p>Across the coun­try, com­mu­ni­ties have seen coro­n­avirus num­bers fall and then shoot back up – not un­like the two ends of a see-saw.</p>
    <p>In Illi­nois, Gov­er­nor J.B. Pritzker sounded an un­usu­ally som­bre note this past week as he de­liv­ered a warn­ing that re­ver­ber­ated across the state: Even though Illi­nois res­i­dents had bat­tled an early flood of in­fec­tions and then man­aged to re­duce the spread of the virus, their suc­cesses were fleet­ing.</p>
    <p>As of last Thurs­day, the state was av­er­ag­ing more than 1,400 cases a day, up from about 800 at the start of last month.</p>
    <p>“We are at a dan­ger point,” Mr Pritzker said.</p>
    <p>Judge Lina Hi­dalgo, the t op elected of­fi­cial in Har­ris County, which in­cludes Hous­ton, Texas, said: “There is a sort of col­lec­tive tired­ness and frus­tra­tion, and of course I feel it too – we all feel it. So, it is dif­fi­cult to know that there is no real end in sight.”</p>
    <p>In US com­mu­ni­ties that saw im­prove­ment in June, such as Mil­wau­kee County in Wis­con­sin, there was a wide­spread feel­ing of re­lief, said Dr Ben We­ston, di­rec­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices for the Mil­wau­kee County Of­fice of Emer­gency Man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>But then mask-wear­ing and so­cial dis­tanc­ing be­gan to re­lax.</p>
    <p>“There was a sense of com­pla­cency, like, ‘We are fi­nally be­yond this; it is fi­nally get­ting bet­ter’,” he said. “We were see­ing our num­bers go down, but the rea­son is be­cause of phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing. It was be­cause peo­ple were be­ing so care­ful. There was no rea­son to think that cases weren’t go­ing to rise.”</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, Wis­con­sin Gov­er­nor Tony Evers, a Demo­crat, made an­other at­tempt to get a han­dle on the out­breaks in his state, is­su­ing an or­der that every res­i­dent wear a mask in­doors and in pub­lic, be­gin­ning last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Many states have traced new out­breaks to the loos­en­ing of the eco­nom­i­cally costly re­stric­tions aimed at stop­ping the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>In Cal­i­for­nia, which has had more than 500,000 coro­n­avirus cases – more than any other state – the re­open­ing has proved dis­as­trous.</p>
    <p>When the pan­demic was rav­aging the north-east in March and April, Cal­i­for­nia kept its daily case count around 2,000, and the state was praised for its early and ag­gres­sive ac­tions to com­bat the virus.</p>
    <p>The state is now av­er­ag­ing more than four times as many cases – 8,500 a day.</p>
    <p>Los An­ge­les County and other South­ern Cal­i­for­nia coun­ties ac­count for the ma­jor­ity of the state’s in­fec­tions, but the virus is now ev­ery­where.</p>
    <p>In Texas, af­ter cases and hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions seemed to level off and even de­crease in re­cent days, Har­ris County broke a sin­gle-day record</p>
    <p>IN­VIS­I­BLE FOE</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>MR ALAN ROSEN, who leads the Har­ris County’s Precinct One Con­sta­ble’s Of­fice, com­par­ing the pan­demic to Hur­ri­cane Har­vey, one of the US’ worst dis­as­ters.</p>
    <p>with 2,100 new cases last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Alan Rosen, who leads the county’s Precinct One Con­sta­ble’s Of­fice, said: “I think, to a cer­tain ex­tent, we saw a spike be­cause peo­ple were fa­tigued over it.</p>
    <p>“They were fa­tigued over hear­ing about it every day. They were fa­tigued about be­ing cooped up in their house and be­ing away from peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Har­ris County res­i­dents have been cop­ing with the lulls and peaks of a phys­i­cal, emo­tional, fis­cal and lo­gis­ti­cal cri­sis from an in­vis­i­ble foe nearly three years af­ter sur­viv­ing Hur­ri­cane Har­vey, one of the worst dis­as­ters in US his­tory.</p>
    <p>“It is a roller coaster,” said Mr Rosen, who has re­cov­ered af­ter get­ting in­fected with the virus in May.</p>
    <p>“It is not like a hur­ri­cane that is com­ing through and we know what to do. We know we got to clean up and re­build, and ev­ery­body is ac­cus­tomed to the time­frame. But with this, there are just so many un­knowns.”</p>
