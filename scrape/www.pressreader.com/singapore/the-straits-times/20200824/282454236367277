    <p>The NTU Cen­tre for Con­tem­po­rary Art (NTU CCA) Singapore, an­chor ten­ant of the Gill­man Bar­racks arts clus­ter, will close its ex­hi­bi­tion space and res­i­dency stu­dios in March next year, when fund­ing from the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board (EDB) ceases.</p>
    <p>This deals yet an­other blow to the arts en­clave off Alexan­dra Road, which in the past five years has seen many art gal­leries leave the area due to low sales and vis­i­tor­ship.</p>
    <p>While NTU CCA’s ex­hi­bi­tion hall and res­i­den­tial stu­dio spa­ces in Blocks 43, 37 and 38 will be gone af­ter March next year, the in­sti­tu­tion will still ex­ist, re­tain­ing its re­search cen­tre and of­fice in Block 6.</p>
    <p>NTU CCA, which opened in Oc­to­ber 2013, was jointly set up by the Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity (NTU) and EDB.</p>
    <p>While its ex­hi­bi­tion hall and res­i­den­cies for in­ter­na­tional artists will be no more, the cen­tre will con­tinue to re­search con­tem­po­rary art and run events for the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Prof Joseph Liow, dean of NTU’s col­lege of hu­man­i­ties, arts and so­cial sciences, told The Straits Times last Fri­day that the cen­tre is “look­ing at di­ver­si­fy­ing the lo­ca­tions of its ex­hi­bi­tion and other ac­tiv­i­ties, and in­creas­ing its pres­ence at the NTU main cam­pus and other NTU lo­ca­tions”.</p>
    <p>Found­ing di­rec­tor Ute Meta Bauer told Chi­nese daily Lianhe Zaobao last Fri­day that the cen­tre chalks up about $2 mil­lion in ex­penses every year, in­clud­ing the cost of rent­ing its ex­hi­bi­tion hall, res­i­den­cies for in­ter­na­tional artists and salaries for staff. With­out fund­ing from EDB, which has sup­ported the cen­tre for the past seven years, it will be hard for it to main­tain its cur­rent range of op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre em­ploys 14 full-time staff, half of whom will not have their con­tracts re­newed af­ter March.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre is still look­ing for new sources of fund­ing, Prof Bauer added.</p>
    <p>Over the years, NTU CCA has con­ducted artist res­i­den­cies and mounted large-scale ex­hi­bi­tions fea­tur­ing top con­tem­po­rary artists such as Sim­ryn Gill, Joan Jonas and Yang Fudong. It has also or­gan­ised nu­mer­ous pub­lic events, in­clud­ing lec­tures, work­shops and fes­ti­vals.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre was tem­po­rar­ily closed due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, but re­opened to the pub­lic last month.</p>
    <p>“The cur­rent en­vi­ron­ment is not easy for many sec­tors in­clud­ing those in arts and cul­ture. Many are look­ing at how to nav­i­gate the new nor­mal and the CCA is no dif­fer­ent,” Prof Liow said.</p>
    <p>“The CCA is go­ing through a pe­riod of tran­si­tion and trans­for­ma­tion of its longer-term ca­pa­bil­i­ties for the post Covid-19 re­cov­ery.”</p>
    <p>This news comes not long af­ter fel­low Gill­man Bar­racks ten­ant Chan + Hori Con­tem­po­rary left in June to trans­form into a cu­ra­to­rial, ad­vi­sory and artist-man­age­ment busi­ness.</p>
    <p>NTU CCA will run an On­line Ben­e­fit Art Auc­tion from Oct 1 to 18 to sup­port two on­go­ing projects – an on­line ar­chive doc­u­ment­ing the cen­tre’s work from its in­cep­tion to the present, and a pub­li­ca­tion ti­tled Cli­mates. Habi­tats. En­vi­ron­ments.</p>
    <p>An ex­hi­bi­tion with works by film­maker Trinh T. Minh-ha, slated to run from Oct 17 to Feb 28 next year, will be the cen­tre’s last show at the en­clave.</p>
    <p>Artist Milenko Pr­vacki, 69, se­nior fel­low at Lasalle Col­lege of the Arts, be­moaned the loss of what he felt was a “very spe­cific and needed space in Singapore”.</p>
    <p>“Singapore artists had the op­por­tu­nity to col­lab­o­rate and have a di­a­logue with in­ter­na­tional artists – and com­pare their place­ment in the world, not only in Singapore... I (also) know many peo­ple who came here and they re­ally en­joyed their res­i­den­cies, learn­ing a lot about Singapore.”</p>
    <p>Robert Zhao, 37, a former Singapore artist-in-res­i­dence, also felt the cen­tre had opened doors for him, not­ing that he met many vis­it­ing cu­ra­tors and had a lot of ex­hi­bi­tion op­por­tu­ni­ties overseas.</p>
    <p>“The cen­tre was very good at mak­ing var­i­ous artists’ works vis­i­ble to the peo­ple who were vis­it­ing.”</p>
    <p>Artist Jen­nifer Teo, 45, co-founder of the Post-Mu­seum col­lec­tive, was sorry to hear the news, adding that the cen­tre’s in­ter­na­tional out­look and large-scale ex­hi­bi­tions helped el­e­vate the stan­dard of art shown in Singapore.</p>
    <p>With a nod to the on­go­ing ex­hi­bi­tion Non-Aligned, whose movingim­age works of­fer “an ed­u­ca­tional, but also de­mand­ing ex­pe­ri­ence”, she said: “Gal­leries might not re­ally show some­thing like this be­cause it’s not that ‘sell­able’ and, for the mu­se­ums, maybe it won’t have such a mass ap­peal.”</p>
    <p>The dis­place­ment of var­i­ous arts in­sti­tu­tions in Singapore has thrown the spot­light on is­sues of fund­ing and pol­icy i n the arts scene.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times re­ported last month that the In­ter­cul­tural Theatre In­sti­tute and theatre com­pany The Nec­es­sary Stage would be los­ing their long-time homes.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, it was an­nounced that Cen­tre 42, a theatre de­vel­op­ment venue in Water­loo Street, would be ren­o­vated and a new Arts Re­source Hub – a Na­tional Arts Coun­cil (NAC) ini­tia­tive to sup­port free­lancers – would co-run the venue, which left the arts com­mu­nity con­cerned that this would af­fect Cen­tre 42’s op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The Sub­sta­tion, a con­tem­po­rary art in­sti­tu­tion founded by late play­wright Kuo Pao Kun in 1990, had also said it was wor­ried about po­ten­tial venue loss af­ter the NAC takes back the build­ing for ren­o­va­tions in July next year.</p>
