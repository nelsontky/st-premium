    <p>Sev­eral waste re­cy­cling com­pa­nies have been taken to task for fail­ing to keep up with safety mea­sures fol­low­ing an en­force­ment blitz which tar­geted firms in the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, a spokesman for the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) said that 34 com­pa­nies were is­sued with warn­ings, with five also re­ceiv­ing fines.</p>
    <p>The com­pa­nies will be re­quired to cor­rect the lapses, fail­ing which they could face stop­page of work or even pros­e­cu­tion in court, said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>Nearly 140 safety lapses pos­ing fire and ex­plo­sion risks were found dur­ing the op­er­a­tion last month.</p>
    <p>The poor han­dling of flammable and toxic gases, as well as ob­struc­tions to fire safety, were among the con­tra­ven­tions MOM in­spec­tors uncovered.</p>
    <p>More than 30 com­pa­nies were in­spected dur­ing the blitz, which was sup­ported by the Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force.</p>
    <p>In­spec­tors also found other dan­ger­ous lapses that could hurt work­ers such as un­safe stack­ing, un­safe elec­tri­cal wiring and poor fork­lift con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, MOM re­minded em­ploy­ers that they should be tak­ing steps to pro­tect their work­ers, such as by con­duct­ing risk as­sess­ments, en­sur­ing that they are not han­dling ma­te­ri­als they are not equipped for, and fol­low­ing safe work prac­tices.</p>
    <p>It also em­pha­sised the im­por­tance of vig­i­lance in pro­tect­ing work­ers’ lives, and re­minded com­pa­nies to en­sure the nec­es­sary safe­guards are in place to pro­tect their em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>“With year-end fes­tiv­i­ties ap­proach­ing, busi­nesses may be ramp­ing up their work ac­tiv­i­ties to meet dead­lines due to ear­lier work sus­pen­sion,” it said.</p>
    <p>“Last year, in Novem­ber and De­cem­ber alone, there was a spate of ac­ci­dents that un­for­tu­nately re­sulted in the death of 13 work­ers,” it added.</p>
