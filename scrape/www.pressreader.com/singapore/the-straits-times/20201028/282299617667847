    <p>• Gym­nasts are used to hav­ing pres­sure on their shoul­ders but the ath­letes head­ing to Tokyo for next month’s spe­cial meet might feel they are car­ry­ing an Olympian bur­den.</p>
    <p>The meet will fea­ture gym­nasts from Ja­pan, the United States, China and Rus­sia, and marks the first in­ter­na­tional event to be held at a Tokyo Olympic venue since the Games were post­poned in March due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>For Tokyo, it is a ma­jor test of the city’s abil­ity to hold an in­ter­na­tional sport­ing event amid the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>For the six Amer­i­can gym­nasts who have elected to com­pete, it is a chance to be a trailblaze­r.</p>
    <p>“This op­por­tu­nity is huge for any ath­lete, not j ust gym­nasts,” Yul Moldauer, a bronze medal­list at the 2017 World Cham­pi­onships, told Reuters from his home in Colorado.</p>
    <p>“We are in a weird time for sport­ing events and so this is our chance to re­ally go out there and kind of make things feel nor­mal again.</p>
    <p>“We get to go out there and com­pete, with ev­ery­thing run­ning smoothly, other coun­tries, other com­peti­tors, (and) other ath­letes will be like, ‘Wow, they have cre</p>
    <p>ated a way, it is safe’.”</p>
    <p>With the pan­demic still rag­ing, the event will not be run ex­actly as it would have been be­fore the health cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“There are pro­ce­dures we will have to fol­low but that is just life right now,” Moldauer, 24, added. “You have to knock down the doors and not let any­thing get in your way, just take it on, ac­cept it and prove to ev­ery­one that it is go­ing to be okay.”</p>
    <p>All four na­tions were in­vited to send up to eight gym­nasts but the US are send­ing a smaller del­e­ga­tion via a char­tered flight as only six felt con­fi­dent in mak­ing the trip.</p>
    <p>The one-day meet will take place on Nov 8 at the Yoyogi Na­tional Gym­na­sium, which will host hand­ball at next year’s Games, and will be at­tended by 2,000 spec­ta­tors.</p>
    <p>For­eign ath­letes are due to ar­rive in Tokyo four days be­fore the event and will not have to go through the usual two-week quar­an­tine pe­riod de­manded of in­ter­na­tional vis­i­tors. How­ever, they will be quar­an­tined for two weeks in their own coun­try be­fore leav­ing for Ja­pan and will un­dergo reg­u­lar Covid-19 test­ing in the build-up to the meet. While in Tokyo, their move­ments will be lim­ited to the gym­na­sium and the team ho­tel.</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional Gym­nas­tics Fed­er­a­tion pres­i­dent Morinari Watan­abe said: “I feel the great­est pres­sure ever at this event in my life. We want to open the door to Tokyo 2020.”</p>
