    <p>WILM­ING­TON (Delaware) • Th­ese are the key ad­vis­ers that United States Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den will rely upon and con­sider for top posts in his new ad­min­is­tra­tion, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple briefed on his early plans:</p>
    <p>IN­NER CIR­CLE</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has long kept a tight in­ner cir­cle on whom he re­lies for strate­gic ad­vice, in­clud­ing his fam­ily mem­bers and chiefs of staff dur­ing his years as Mr Barack Obama’s vice-pres­i­dent – Mr Ron Klain, Mr Steve Ric­chetti and Mr Bruce Reed.</p>
    <p>Mr Klain, a po­lit­i­cal tac­ti­cian, is widely seen as a lead­ing choice to be Mr Bi­den’s ini­tial chief of staff.</p>
    <p>Prom­i­nent roles are also likely for con­gress­man Cedric Rich­mond of Louisiana and Los An­ge­les Mayor Eric Garcetti, who cochaired Mr Bi­den’s cam­paign.</p>
    <p>THE PAN­DEMIC</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s No. 1 pol­icy pri­or­ity is get­ting the coro­n­avirus pan­demic un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>He has promised that he will ask Dr An­thony Fauci, the top US in­fec­tious diseases ex­pert who has clashed with Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, to stay on in his role.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing his cam­paign, he turned most of­ten for brief­ings on the pan­demic to for­mer sur­geon-gen­eral Vivek Murthy, who is also ex­pected to play a role in the new ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>THE RE­COV­ERY</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has a host of top eco­nomic po­si­tions to fill in his ad­min­is­tra­tion, in­clud­ing sec­re­tary of the Trea­sury, where Fed­eral Re­serve gov­er­nor Lael Brainard and for­mer Trea­sury deputy sec­re­tary Sarah Bloom Raskin are seen as top con­tenders.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s se­lec­tion for the post must be ap­proved by the US Se­nate, which might still be in Repub­li­can hands de­pend­ing on the out­come of two Ge­or­gia run-off elec­tions in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den is also ex­pected to tap some of his long-time eco­nomic ad­vis­ers, in­clud­ing Mr Jared Bern­stein and Mr Ben Har­ris, for key eco­nomic ad­vi­sory po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>Both have ad­vo­cated for ag­gres­sive stim­u­lus to prime the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>FOR­EIGN POL­ICY</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den prom­ises to re­set re­la­tion­ships with al­lies and ad­ver­saries abroad early in his term.</p>
    <p>Mr Antony Blinken, one of Mr Bi­den’s clos­est ad­vis­ers on the cam­paign, is be­ing con­sid­ered for national se­cu­rity ad­viser or sec­re­tary of state. Mr Blinken has ad­vo­cated a force­ful lead­er­ship role for the US abroad to con­front pos­si­ble ad­ver­saries, such as China, while also stress­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for co­op­er­a­tion with other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Ms Susan Rice, who was vet­ted to be Mr Bi­den’s run­ning mate, is con­sid­ered a top pick for sec­re­tary of state as well. So, too, is one of Mr Bi­den’s big­gest sup­port­ers in the Se­nate, Mr Chris Coons of Delaware.</p>
    <p>Ms Michele Flournoy, a for­mer top US Depart­ment of De­fence of­fi­cial who co-founded a con­sult­ing firm with Mr Blinken, is con­sid­ered a top pick to run the Pen­tagon.</p>
    <p>CLI­MATE CHANGE</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s team is con­sid­er­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of nam­ing a “cli­mate czar” to de­liver on the prom­ises that the Pres­i­dent-elect made dur­ing his cam­paign to tackle the is­sue.</p>
    <p>Pos­si­bil­i­ties for that role in­clude for­mer se­na­tor John Kerry as well as Mr Brian Deese, both of whom helped ne­go­ti­ate the Paris cli­mate deal that Mr Bi­den wants to rejoin. An­other pos­si­bil­ity is Wash­ing­ton state Gov­er­nor Jay Inslee.</p>

The Louisiana con&#xAD;gress&#xAD;man co-chaired Mr Bi&#xAD;den&#x2019;s cam&#xAD;paign and is ex&#xAD;pected to be con&#xAD;sid&#xAD;ered for a prom&#xAD;i&#xAD;nent role in his new ad&#xAD;min&#xAD;is&#xAD;tra&#xAD;tion.</p>
