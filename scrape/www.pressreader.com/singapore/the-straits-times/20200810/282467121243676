    <p>MU­NICH • Treble-chas­ing Bay­ern Mu­nich are rel­ish­ing their Cham­pi­ons League quar­ter-fi­nal against Barcelona in Lis­bon af­ter Robert Le­wandowski net­ted twice to seal a 4-1 home win over Chelsea on Satur­day in their last-16, re­turn-leg tie.</p>
    <p>“The an­tic­i­pa­tion is enor­mous. Barcelona have a good team with very good play­ers, but if you look at the last few weeks, we can fly to Por­tu­gal with a lot of con­fi­dence,” said de­fender David Alaba.</p>
    <p>Bay­ern have every rea­son to feel con­fi­dent. Un­like Chelsea, the Ger­man cham­pi­ons had not played in a com­pet­i­tive game in over a month fol­low­ing the con­clu­sion of the do­mes­tic cam­paign, yet they were by far the bet­ter, hun­grier and fit­ter team at the Al­lianz Arena.</p>
    <p>Le­wandowski, the Cham­pi­ons League’s top scorer, bagged his 12th and 13th goals in the com­pe­ti­tion this sea­son, play­ing a part in all four of their goals as they pro­gressed 7-1 on ag­gre­gate.</p>
    <p>Ivan Perisic and Corentin Tolisso were their other scor­ers, while Tammy Abra­ham struck for the Blues, leav­ing Alaba con­vinced they can lift their first Euro­pean Cup since 2013, the year of their maiden treble.</p>
    <p>“We can be pleased, it was our first game for a month and it’s not easy to keep the rhythm,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We have pre­pared for this for the last two weeks and you could see the re­sult.”</p>
    <p>Le­wandowski’s hot streak – he has al­ready notched a ca­reer-best 53 goals in all com­pe­ti­tions – will be key to beat­ing Barca on Friday.</p>
    <p>The Poland striker is now four goals short of Cristiano Ron­aldo’s record of 17 Cham­pi­ons League strikes set in the 2013-14 sea­son and as long as he keeps putting chances away, their sixth Euro­pean Cup is on the cards this year.</p>
    <p>“We have a few more games in the knock­out round and I am just as happy cre­at­ing goals as scor­ing them,” the Pole said.</p>
    <p>“We have to per­form well and show our qual­ity as a team against a good Barcelona side, it’s a big game for ev­ery­body.”</p>
    <p>Chelsea boss Frank Lam­pard, how­ever, be­lieves Bay­ern are the favourites af­ter the Lon­don team were hum­bled in both legs.</p>
    <p>“Nights like this, in a foot­balling sense, show me a lot, tell me a lot,” he said. “It was a hard start for us with con­ced­ing two early goals... re­spect to Bay­ern, they de­served the win.</p>
    <p>“They have a lot of ex­pe­ri­ence and know how to win this com­pe­ti­tion, so, yeah, they are among the favourites.”</p>
