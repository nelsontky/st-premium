    <p>For as long as I can re­mem­ber, I have been ad­dicted to in­stant noo­dles. My re­la­tion­ship with in­stant noo­dles can be de­scribed in three phases.</p>
    <p>The first phase be­gan when I en­coun­tered in­stant noo­dles for the first time. A hot, steam­ing bowl of yel­low noo­dles in a pool of savoury broth. It was the first meal I re­mem­ber hav­ing in my life. My pa­ter­nal grand­mother, Ah Ma, fed it to me daily when I was a young child.</p>
    <p>At the time, I didn’t know any bet­ter. I thought every kid in Sin­ga­pore was pre­sented with a bowl of in­stant noo­dles to start the day. How I took it for granted; the bouncy noo­dles, en­tic­ing flavours and fra­grant soup bases. How lucky and happy I felt.</p>
    <p>Ah Ma brought my fa­ther from China to Sin­ga­pore as a baby with noth­ing but the clothes on her back. De­spite hum­ble be­gin­nings, mother and son built a new life here. Food and money were al­ways tight. But af­ter sur­viv­ing numer­ous hard­ships, my fa­ther was able to get a sec­ondary school ed­u­ca­tion and be­came a pri­mary school teacher. In the teach­ing ser­vice, he met my mother and they mar­ried.</p>
    <p>On modest teacher salaries in the late 1970s, my par­ents bought a four-room Hous­ing Board flat and, soon af­ter, a shiny blue Dat­sun 100A. The start of the Sin­ga­pore Dream.</p>
    <p>My fa­ther never for­got how poor he was grow­ing up. He walked with a limp be­cause of a po­lio in­fec­tion as a child, wors­ened by sub­se­quent lack of nour­ish­ment. But he loved Sin­ga­pore be­cause it was the coun­try that gave him a chance. In re­turn, he never said no when asked to do more for his school or stu­dents.</p>
    <p>I learnt from him that serv­ing the coun­try was the nat­u­ral thing to do, as an ex­pres­sion of grat­i­tude for how far we had come as a fam­ily.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond phase of my rocky re­la­tion­ship with in­stant noo­dles be­gan in my angsty teen years. The pack­ets were con­tra­band in our house­hold be­cause of my health-con­scious mother and the death of my fa­ther at age 33.</p>
    <p>The con­ven­tional wis­dom then was that monosodium glu­ta­mate (MSG), the magic in­gre­di­ent that makes the noo­dles taste so good, caused hair loss and other health com­pli­ca­tions. The al­leged health risk, cou­pled with my mother’s stri­dent cam­paigns against salt and sat­u­rated fat, meant that in­stant noo­dles were ex­cised from our house­hold dur­ing my teenage years.</p>
    <p>Mum be­lieved in­stant noo­dles were the di­abol­i­cal food that caused cancer in my fa­ther, re­sult­ing in his pass­ing away when I was six years old. Eat­ing in­stant noo­dles, un­der her watch, was like mak­ing her re­live the tor­ture of watch­ing my fa­ther wast­ing to death all over again.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing those years, my re­la­tion­ship with Sin­ga­pore be­came sim­i­larly fraught. I was in­fat­u­ated with the Amer­i­can First Amend­ment right of free­dom of speech. The con­cept of how the Gov­ern­ment “shall make no law... pro­hibit­ing the free ex­er­cise thereof; or abridg­ing the free­dom of speech, or of the press” ap­pealed greatly to me. My dream was to get a uni­ver­sity schol­ar­ship and study in the United States.</p>
    <p>I be­came the ed­i­tor of my ju­nior col­lege’s stu­dent news­pa­per and used it as a plat­form to pub­lish var­i­ous ar­ti­cles and let­ters to test the lim­its of free speech and the press.</p>
    <p>The prin­ci­pal of the col­lege was a woman blessed with in­fi­nite wis­dom and pa­tience. She of­ten took the time to speak to me and took a gen­uine in­ter­est in my writ­ing and views.</p>
    <p>To her credit, she never took me to task for any of the pub­lished ar­ti­cles. She did, how­ever, call me out on a note I wrote to one of her col­leagues at the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE), which was quite dis­re­spect­ful and cap­tured the hubris I felt at the time. Adding in­sult to in­jury, the note con­tained a trendy swear word used by young peo­ple then.</p>
    <p>My prin­ci­pal asked to see me shortly af­ter. Dur­ing our brief in­ter­ac­tion, she asked that I re­flect on what I had done. Her part­ing words to me were that if I did not sober up, I might not get the schol­ar­ship I so de­sired.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent taught me about the power of the spo­ken and writ­ten word. I learnt that the free­dom to speak and write freely also comes with the re­spon­si­bil­ity of con­sid­er­ing the feel­ings of oth­ers. Upon re­flec­tion, I apol­o­gised to my prin­ci­pal and the MOE of­fi­cial whom I had of­fended.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, I lapsed back into teenage hubris shortly af­ter, throw­ing my­self once again into stu­dent writ­ing and sport­ing ac­tiv­i­ties, ne­glect­ing my stud­ies. Even­tu­ally, I did not land an over­seas uni­ver­sity schol­ar­ship be­cause of modest grades. The lim­ited fi­nan­cial re­sources of my sin­gle mum were in­ad­e­quate to fund any over­seas ed­u­ca­tion as­pi­ra­tions and I was crushed.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal phase of my re­la­tion­ship with in­stant noo­dles started years later, when I was well along in my pro­fes­sional life.</p>
    <p>By then, I had fi­nally made it to the US, the land of my dreams.</p>
    <p>As the chief tech­nol­ogy of­fi­cer of a US med­i­cal de­vice com­pany, I was of­ten urged to ap­ply for a Green Card and con­sider re­lo­cat­ing to the US per­ma­nently. By then, our fam­ily had lived there on and off for five years. We were set­tled and life was easy. But the dis­tance to age­ing par­ents and friends, and an aching long­ing for home, made it dif­fi­cult for us to per­ma­nently up­root from Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Be­ing far away from home with two young kids, my wife and I would some­times pre­pare in­stant noo­dles for din­ner, when work got in the way and there was pre­cious lit­tle time to feed the chil­dren be­fore bed­time.</p>
    <p>Thanks to those meals, my two sons, like me, are in­stant noo­dle ad­dicts. Even today, no stay­ca­tion, va­ca­tion or away-from-home jaunt is com­plete with­out an in­stant noo­dle feast. For us, the burst of flavour in in­stant noo­dles is closely as­so­ci­ated with the cel­e­bra­tion of fam­ily time to­gether.</p>
    <p>The pass­ing years have al­lowed me to de­velop a more nu­anced view of my af­fec­tion for in­stant noo­dles and Sin­ga­pore. In­stant noo­dles will never be the most nu­tri­tious food item in any kitchen. They are a con­ve­nience food that pack a mighty taste punch. They also re­mind me of home and fam­ily, and rekin­dle many pre­cious child­hood mem­o­ries.</p>
    <p>The 30 bil­lion packs of in­stant noo­dles con­sumed world­wide each year in­di­cate that I am not alone in my fond­ness. A Ja­panese poll in the year 2000 voted in­stant noo­dles the coun­try’s best in­ven­tion of all time. As the Ja­panese in­ven­tor of in­stant noo­dle, Mo­mo­fuku Ando, put it: “Mankind is Noodlekind.”</p>
    <p>Like in­stant noo­dles, Sin­ga­pore is by no means per­fect. But it is the lit­tle red dot that punches above its weight in con­ve­nience, ef­fi­ciency and safety, as well as be­ing a glob­ally de­sir­able city to live in and raise kids.</p>
    <p>There are many things about Sin­ga­pore that can be im­proved, like how we treat for­eign work­ers and how we ad­dress the in­equal­ity that is in­creas­ingly vis­i­ble in our coun­try.</p>
    <p>But Sin­ga­pore is a place with much heart. In the words of the na­tional song Home: “This is home truly, where I know I must be, where my dreams wait for me, where the river al­ways flows.”</p>
    <p>So that is my con­fes­sion. I love Sin­ga­pore like I love in­stant noo­dles. Both are not per­fect, but it is a love that binds.</p>
