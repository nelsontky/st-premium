    <p>A panel headed by Jus­tice Ju­dith Prakash yes­ter­day is­sued sen­tenc­ing guide­lines to help the med­i­cal pro­fes­sion “ar­rive at fair and con­sis­tent sen­tenc­ing de­ci­sions”, said the Sin­ga­pore Med­i­cal Coun­cil (SMC).</p>
    <p>The com­mit­tee was one of two set up last year to im­prove the SMC’s dis­ci­plinary process. It com­prised four lawyers, six doc­tors and a rep­re­sen­ta­tive each from the min­istries of health and law. The other com­mit­tee was to speed up dis­ci­plinary pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>The SMC as med­i­cal watch­dog metes out pun­ish­ment to er­rant doc­tors. Its dis­ci­plinary tri­bunals (DTs) usu­ally com­prise two doc­tors and one lay per­son or legally trained per­son.</p>
    <p>Ex­plain­ing the need to re­view the process, Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong told Par­lia­ment in April last year that there had been some un­fair penal­ties from the DTs.</p>
    <p>“Some sen­tences are not com­men­su­rate with the cir­cum­stances of the case,” he said.</p>
    <p>“De­spite their best ef­forts, some DTs are too lax while oth­ers are too dra­co­nian, and the SMC has had to ap­peal to the court against the sen­tences meted out.”</p>
    <p>A num­ber of DT judg­ments had been over­turned by the Court of Three Judges on ap­peal.</p>
    <p>The 54-page guide­lines ex­plain when tri­bunals need to mete out more se­vere penal­ties and when they should be lighter. It gives some real ex­am­ples as ref­er­ences.</p>
    <p>When a doc­tor is found guilty by a DT, sen­tenc­ing op­tions range from coun­selling, cen­sure and fines, to sus­pen­sion and strik­ing the doc­tor’s name off the med­i­cal reg­is­ter so he can no longer prac­tise.</p>
    <p>A doc­tor is sen­tenced for wrong­do­ing in or­der to:</p>
    <p>• Up­hold peo­ple’s faith in doc­tors • Pro­tect peo­ple’s health, safety</p>
    <p>and well-be­ing</p>
    <p>• Act as a gen­eral de­ter­rence by</p>
    <p>mak­ing an ex­am­ple of a doc­tor • Stop a par­tic­u­lar doc­tor from re-of­fend­ing. This is par­tic­u­larly applicable for re­cal­ci­trant doc­tors</p>
    <p>• Retri­bu­tion to pun­ish a doc­tor</p>
    <p>guilty of mis­con­duct • Re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion in less se­ri­ous cases, if the doc­tor is amenable to re­form</p>
    <p>Of all the ob­jec­tives, pub­lic in­ter­est is para­mount, the guide states. It said a sen­tence might ap­pear ex­ces­sive given the of­fence, but might be “war­ranted from a pub­lic in­ter­est per­spec­tive”.</p>
    <p>Harm, it said, is not just bod­ily in­jury, but also emo­tional or psy­cho­log­i­cal dis­tress, se­ri­ous eco­nomic harm, in­creased pre-dis­po­si­tion to cer­tain ill­nesses, de­pen­dence or tol­er­ance of ad­dic­tive drugs, loss of chance of re­cu­per­a­tion, or death.</p>
    <p>It said fines should be for mi­nor of­fences or in ad­di­tion to another penalty where a doc­tor had prof­ited from the mis­con­duct. Fines could also be used where a sus­pen­sion has no im­pact, for ex­am­ple if the doc­tor is no longer prac­tis­ing.</p>
    <p>A sus­pen­sion is mer­ited “when the mis­con­duct is se­ri­ous and un­be­fit­ting of a doc­tor”. As it is a se­ri­ous sanc­tion, it does not rec­om­mend a sus­pen­sion of a nom­i­nal pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Strik­ing a doc­tor off the med­i­cal reg­is­ter is for the most se­ri­ous cases, such as fla­grant abuse of po­si­tion, if he caused grave harm to pa­tients or so­ci­ety, if the mis­con­duct in­di­cates a se­ri­ous char­ac­ter de­fect, or for sex­ual of­fences.</p>
    <p>An im­por­tant rea­son for strik­ing a doc­tor off is dis­hon­esty – even if the of­fence does not in­volve his prac­tice or pa­tients. How­ever, mit­i­gat­ing fac­tors in­clude the ex­tent of the de­cep­tion, the rea­sons for it and if ac­tual harm was caused.</p>
    <p>The guide­lines state that se­nior­ity or the em­i­nence of the of­fender is an ag­gra­vat­ing, and not a mit­i­gat­ing, fac­tor.</p>
