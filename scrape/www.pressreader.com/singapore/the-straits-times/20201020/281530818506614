    <p>Nearly 1,000 house­holds have signed up for the cen­tralised cool­ing sys­tem in the up­com­ing Ten­gah town. Home own­ers who opt for the sys­tem will save around 15 per cent to 20 per cent in up­front costs, com­pared with cur­rent mar­ket rates, and up to 30 per cent in life cy­cle costs, SP Group said.</p>
    <p>Nearly 1,000 house­holds have signed up for the cen­tralised cool­ing sys­tem (CCS) in the up­com­ing “for­est town” of Ten­gah, where some 8,000 Build-To-Or­der (BTO) flats have been launched so far.</p>
    <p>Home own­ers who opt for the en­ergy-ef­fi­cient sys­tem will save around 15 per cent to 20 per cent in up­front costs com­pared with cur­rent mar­ket rates, and up to 30 per cent in life cy­cle costs, en­ergy util­i­ties provider SP Group, which runs the sys­tem in Ten­gah, said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The CCS is one of many smart fea­tures that will be im­ple­mented in Ten­gah, which is billed as a “smart en­ergy” town pow­ered by ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence.</p>
    <p>Un­der the CCS, chilled wa­ter will be piped to homes from cen­tralised chillers in­stalled on the rooftops of se­lected Hous­ing Board blocks. This is more en­ergy-ef­fi­cient com­pared with con­ven­tional air-con­di­tion­ing sys­tems, said SP Group.</p>
    <p>The sys­tem will be pow­ered by so­lar en­ergy gen­er­ated by ver­ti­cal and hor­i­zon­tal so­lar pan­els on the rooftops of HDB blocks.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents can also mon­i­tor and con­trol their home en­ergy us­age via the MyTen­gah app, which will be run by SP Group.</p>
    <p>They will be able to lo­cate elec­tric ve­hi­cle charg­ing points via the app as well, and ac­cu­mu­late points by par­tic­i­pat­ing in sus­tain­able ac­tiv­i­ties that can be ex­changed for re­wards.</p>
    <p>A dig­i­tal dash­board will be in­stalled at the lift lobby of each hous­ing block, which tracks the block’s util­i­ties con­sump­tion and im­pact on the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>These eco-boards will also pro­vide res­i­dents with tips on how to re­duce elec­tri­cal and wa­ter con­sump­tion, on top of pro­mot­ing “sus­tain­able be­hav­iour through util­i­ties-sav­ings com­pe­ti­tions between blocks”, said SP Group.</p>
    <p>From to­day, fu­ture res­i­dents and mem­bers of the pub­lic can visit the new MyTen­gah Ex­pe­ri­ence Cen­tre at HDB Hub in Toa Payoh Cen­tral to learn more about the CCS and other eco-friendly so­lu­tions that will be im­ple­mented in Ten­gah.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors will be able to see the setup of the air-con­di­tion­ing sys­tem in a home set­ting and learn how the sys­tem op­er­ates through var­i­ous in­ter­ac­tive displays.</p>
    <p>Ad­vance book­ing is rec­om­mended, al­though walk-ins are al­lowed, sub­ject to ca­pac­ity lim­its.</p>
    <p>The 97 sq m ex­pe­ri­ence cen­tre can take around 16 vis­i­tors at any one time.</p>
    <p>Mr S Har­sha, man­ag­ing direc­tor of sus­tain­able en­ergy so­lu­tions in Sin­ga­pore for SP Group, said that Ten­gah will be the first town in Sin­ga­pore to have a large-scale cen­tralised cool­ing sys­tem, i n line with na­tional sus­tain­abil­ity ef­forts. There are plans to pro­vide pre­dic­tive air-con­di­tion­ing main­te­nance ser­vices for home own­ers us­ing the data col­lected, he said.</p>
    <p>“This is part of the end-to-end ser­vice SP Group hopes to pro­vide, on top of the reg­u­lar main­te­nance of the cen­tralised chillers,” he added.</p>
    <p>Around 98 per cent of the house­holds that were in­tro­duced to the CCS by staff from SP Group opted in, al­though Mr S Har­sha noted that they were not able to con­tact</p>
    <p>KEEPING UP WITH TECH</p>
    <p>all 8,000 house­holds due to rules dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod and in-per­son re­stric­tions put in place be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Pay­ment will be made only on the day home own­ers col­lect the keys to their new homes, with air-con­di­tion­ing units by Daikin pre-in­stalled in their homes, said SP Group.</p>
    <p>The group de­clined to re­veal the ex­act cost of the CCS.</p>
    <p>When com­pleted, Ten­gah could com­prise around 30,000 pub­lic hous­ing units and 12,000 pri­vate ones.</p>
    <p>Sales­man Lim Kwok Mun, 71, and his wife Su­san Lee, 68, a house­wife, were drawn to the green­ery in Ten­gah and de­cided to ap­ply for a three-room BTO flat in Plan­ta­tion dis­trict last year.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Lim: “The idea of a cen­tralised cool­ing sys­tem is very cool; it’s like a ho­tel where you go in and ev­ery­thing is man­aged for you.</p>
    <p>“We are quite ad­ven­tur­ous and want to keep up with tech­nol­ogy, so we want to make our re­tire­ment home a smart home.”</p>
