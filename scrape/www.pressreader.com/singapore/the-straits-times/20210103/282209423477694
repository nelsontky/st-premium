    <p>It’s ex­cit­ing to be in­tro­duc­ing peo­ple to Sin­ga­pore, Tamil and bilin­gual rap – which I feel is unique to Sin­ga­pore. It’s fun to show peo­ple our colours.</p>
    <p>TAMIL-ENGLISH RAP, HIP-HOP ARTIST YUNG RAJA, who is the first Asian act signed to United States-based Alamo Records</p>
    <p>With his heady blend of spit­fire Tamil-English rap, hip-hop artist Yung Raja is among a hand­ful of en­ter­tain­ers suc­cess­fully putting Sin­ga­pore on the global mu­sic map.</p>
    <p>The Def Jam South East Asia artist is tak­ing a crack at the Amer­i­can mar­ket, the first Sin­ga­porean to be pro­moted glob­ally by par­ent record la­bel Uni­ver­sal Mu­sic Group this year.</p>
    <p>Just like his 2019 song, Mad Bless­ings, Raja – real name Ra­jid Ahamed – says 2020 has been filled with noth­ing but “mad bless­ings” for him.</p>
    <p>The 25-year-old’s unique bilin­gual flow has served him well in mar­kets like bil­lion-strong In­dia, where his mu­sic video for The Dance Song re­ceived a global pre­miere on mu­sic chan­nel VH1 in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>With its cheeky ref­er­ences to lyrics from In­dian com­poser A.R. Rah­man’s songs from the 1990s and le­gendary In­dian ac­tor Ra­jinikanth’s iconic one-lin­ers, The Dance Song i ntro­duced a wider au­di­ence to his brand of bright, lively rap and gar­nered more t han one mil­lion views within two months of its release.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing hot on its heels was an ac­com­pa­ny­ing Gen Z-friendly “The Wig­gly Chal­lenge” on TikTok, jump­ing on the pop­u­lar trend of artists cre­at­ing 15- to 30sec­ond-long dances for fol­low­ers and fans to recre­ate.</p>
    <p>De­spite in­ter­na­tional tour­ing be­ing scup­pered by the pan­demic, Raja was a head­lin­ing per­former at the In­dia-based Bac­ardi NH7 Week­ender last month – a vir­tual mu­sic fes­ti­val that drew 65,000 view­ers over three days.</p>
    <p>Last year, Raja be­came the first</p>
    <p>Asian act signed to United States­based Alamo Records, which rep­re­sents a ros­ter of up­com­ing Amer­i­can rap­pers, in­clud­ing Smokepurpp and Lil Durk.</p>
    <p>“In 2018 and 2019, when I started out, the team had our eyes on In­dia, which was part of the early game plan,” he tells The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>“But with Alamo on board, we’ve had to ad­just our per­spec­tive be­cause the pic­ture might be much larger.</p>
    <p>“Me and my team never saw (a deal from the US) com­ing, but it’s a great in­di­ca­tor that we’ve been go­ing down the right path. Peo­ple are re­cep­tive to the sound and the brand, es­pe­cially through the eyes of the West,” he adds.</p>
    <p>He says that mov­ing for­ward, he will be “keep­ing the Amer­i­can au­di­ence i n mind, more than be­fore”, lever­ag­ing his sign­ings and re­leas­ing new mu­sic and col­lab­o­ra­tions at a greater fre­quency.</p>
    <p>He is tight-lipped on the specifics, but says that “plans for 2021 are shap­ing up nicely, with some ma­jor an­nounce­ments”.</p>
    <p>He ac­knowl­edges his lyrical com­po­si­tions might have to be slightly ad­justed, for ex­am­ple by cut­ting down on Tamil con­tent to get the at­ten­tion of Amer­i­can au­di­ences, but he is stead­fast about the “ul­ti­mate game plan to put ‘Tan­glish’ on the map”.</p>
    <p>He also sees his role as in­tro­duc­ing new au­di­ences to the di­ver­sity of mu­sic from Sin­ga­pore, and shift­ing per­spec­tives.</p>
    <p>“A lot of peo­ple are sur­prised by the fact that I’m a Tamil rap­per from Sin­ga­pore – they never re­alised that we are cul­tur­ally and ar­tis­ti­cally so rich,” he says.</p>
    <p>“It’s ex­cit­ing to be in­tro­duc­ing peo­ple to Sin­ga­pore, Tamil and bilin­gual rap – which I feel is unique to Sin­ga­pore. It’s fun to show peo­ple our colours.”</p>
    <p>The as­cent does not look like it is stop­ping any time soon. Like his rap moniker, Raja, which means king in Tamil, is poised to take the crown.</p>
