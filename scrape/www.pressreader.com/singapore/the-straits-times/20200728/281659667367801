    <p>If there is an up­side to the Covid-19 pan­demic, it is the reaf­fir­ma­tion of the Sin­ga­pore spirit, and how Sin­ga­pore­ans’ re­silience as one peo­ple has seen them through this cri­sis thus far, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob said.</p>
    <p>To see Sin­ga­pore through the next phase of this “ex­is­ten­tial cri­sis” – the most se­ri­ous since in­de­pen­dence – Madam Hal­imah urged Sin­ga­pore­ans to unite be­hind the newly elected govern­ment, and give it their full sup­port to take the coun­try through the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the start of a cer­e­mony to swear in Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong and his new Cabi­net, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah said Sin­ga­pore­ans from all walks of life have come to­gether to mo­bilise re­sources in this “most dif­fi­cult of times” and stood with one an­other.</p>
    <p>“For this next phase, I ask Sin­ga­pore­ans to sim­i­larly unite be­hind the Govern­ment that we have elected, and give it our full sup­port to see Sin­ga­pore through this cri­sis,” she said, adding she had con­fi­dence in PM Lee and his team to steer Sin­ga­pore safely through tu­mul­tuous times.</p>
    <p>Madam Hal­imah also took stock of the sig­nif­i­cant progress Sin­ga­pore has made in the last five years.</p>
    <p>Just six months ago, it was a very dif­fer­ent world, she said. Sin­ga­pore was ad­vanc­ing steadily on the course it had set over many years to develop the coun­try, be it up­grad­ing the econ­omy and work­force, building phys­i­cal in­fra­struc­ture or strength­en­ing so­cial safety nets.</p>
    <p>Although there were grow­ing con­cerns about glob­al­i­sa­tion – with free trade in re­treat and geopo­lit­i­cal ten­sions ris­ing – Sin­ga­pore was cop­ing “bet­ter than most” be­cause its peo­ple were united, and the Govern­ment was fo­cused on ad­dress­ing peo­ple’s con­cerns, she said.</p>
    <p>She noted that many so­ci­eties around the world were un­der stress, with their peo­ple an­gry and frus­trated, fu­elling a wave of na­tivism and pro­tec­tion­ism that erupted in var­i­ous forms such as Brexit, the Yel­low Vests in France or the dras­tic loss of sup­port for mod­er­ate po­lit­i­cal lead­ers else­where. As a highly open so­ci­ety, Sin­ga­pore was ex­posed to these same pres­sures.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, in the last five years, Sin­ga­pore made “sig­nif­i­cant progress” in sev­eral ar­eas, she said. Its com­pet­i­tive­ness on the eco­nomic front was strength­ened, and the Fu­ture Econ­omy Coun­cil chaired by Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat led the ef­fort to trans­form in­dus­tries and re­train work­ers to stay em­ploy­able.</p>
    <p>The so­cial com­pact was also strength­ened, with in­vest­ments and pol­icy re­forms to make ba­sic needs of life more ac­ces­si­ble and af­ford­able, from en­hanced preschool sub­si­dies to the Pi­o­neer and Merdeka Gen­er­a­tion pack­ages. Schemes like Work­fare and ComCare were en­hanced, and de­liv­ery of so­cial ser­vices im­proved.</p>
    <p>Madam Hal­imah de­scribed Covid-19 as an up­heaval that could set Sin­ga­pore back for many years, but said progress made in the last term of govern­ment has given the coun­try a strong base to work from.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had to muster its strength and re­sources to mount an emer­gency re­sponse – in­tro­duc­ing rig­or­ous safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, launch­ing a mas­sive and com­plex op­er­a­tion to bring the out­break in mi­grant worker dor­mi­to­ries un­der con­trol and in­ject­ing close to $100 bil­lion in four Bud­gets to cush­ion the im­pact on jobs and in­comes.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment sought the Pres­i­dent’s per­mis­sion to draw more than half of that amount from past re­serves, which was ap­proved.</p>
    <p>Madam Hal­imah said: “I con­curred with its as­sess­ment that we needed to bring all our re­sources to bear to deal with this ex­is­ten­tial chal­lenge – the most se­ri­ous since our na­tion’s in­de­pen­dence – and pro­tect Sin­ga­pore­ans’ lives and liveli­hoods.”</p>
    <p>She added that af­ter six months of un­remit­ting ef­fort on the part of front-line work­ers, the sit­u­a­tion has sta­bilised in Sin­ga­pore, although the cri­sis is far from over.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment called a gen­eral elec­tion to se­cure a fresh man­date and a new full term, to make nec­es­sary and dif­fi­cult de­ci­sions to deal with the trou­bled times ahead, she said. “Now that the elec­tion is over, we must fo­cus on the chal­lenges and the agenda ahead.”</p>
