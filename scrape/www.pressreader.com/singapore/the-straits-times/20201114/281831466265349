    <p>Mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism and in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion has served the world well since World War II, but global or­gan­i­sa­tions and sys­tems need to be up­dated for to­day’s world, said De­fence Min­is­ter Ng Eng Hen.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic is but the lat­est event to have “shak­ened and weak­ened the very pil­lars” of the cur­rent global sys­tem, said Dr Ng.</p>
    <p>But coun­tries should re­think and re­work the sys­tem with­out throw­ing the baby out with the bath wa­ter, he added at a vir­tual di­a­logue yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Glob­al­i­sa­tion 1.0 was not per­fect, but it did serve our needs,” said Dr Ng, in an hour-long vir­tual di­a­logue or­gan­ised by Ger­man think-tank Kon­rad Ade­nauer Stiftung and the S. Ra­jarat­nam School of In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies (RSIS).</p>
    <p>“A re­gres­sion to parochial na­tivist and dis­crim­i­na­tory poli­cies by any coun­try...will re­sult again in bloc and mis­aligned in­ter­ests which led to the pre­vi­ous two world wars.”</p>
    <p>Of the many chal­lenges fac­ing this gen­er­a­tion, Dr Ng said the threat to mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism and co­op­er­a­tion is the quin­tes­sen­tial one as it af­fects the fun­da­men­tal sta­bil­ity of the cur­rent world or­der.</p>
    <p>This or­der, rooted in mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism, had al­lowed for progress, de­vel­op­ment and peace for many, in­clud­ing Ger­many, Ja­pan, China and Asean.</p>
    <p>Yet even be­fore the pan­demic, a se­ries of global events had dis­rupted this sys­tem. United States for­eign pol­icy, for in­stance, shifted con­sid­er­ably over the past decade, as it saw the sys­tem as un­fair given out­comes that favoured some coun­tries at the ex­pense of oth­ers, in­clud­ing it­self, said Dr Ng.</p>
    <p>China’s rise also presents a chal­lenge to the ex­ist­ing frame­work, which is built on demo­cratic and lib­eral ideas, as has man­ag­ing ten­sions re­lated to ji­hadi ter­ror­ism and mi­gra­tion, which has strained the ex­ist­ing so­cial fab­ric of com­mu­ni­ties in Europe.</p>
    <p>The way for­ward is for mul­ti­lat­eral or­gan­i­sa­tions to build more ro­bust global norms, and en­sure more eq­ui­table and ef­fec­tive use of in­ter­na­tional law to ad­dress in­ad­e­qua­cies that have sur­faced, he said.</p>
    <p>“What is at stake, with­out sound­ing an ex­ag­ger­a­tion, is in­deed a re­vised world or­der,” he said.</p>
    <p>The ses­sion, ti­tled The Indo-Pa­cific: Geostrate­gic Chal­lenges and Op­por­tu­ni­ties for Ger­many and Sin­ga­pore, was also at­tended by Ger­man De­fence Min­is­ter An­negret Kramp-Kar­ren­bauer.</p>
    <p>Mrs Kramp-Kar­ren­bauer agreed, not­ing that com­mon chal­lenges to hu­man­ity such as cli­mate change can be tack­led only with a global ap­proach, with all na­tions on board. Ter­ror­ism also “at­tacks all of us”, from peo­ple in Paris, to Nice, Vi­enna and Kabul, she added.</p>
    <p>“At the same time, we see that there is a cer­tain trend (of) more re­gion­al­i­sa­tion or a need to find more re­gional an­swers – this will not work,” she said. That is why coun­tries with shared val­ues and in­ter­ests need to stand and act to­gether, she said.</p>
    <p>Dr Ng ex­pressed op­ti­mism that a clash be­tween the US and China is not in­evitable. “China has as much to lose as it has to gain from a break­ing down of mul­ti­lat­eral sys­tems, as does the US.</p>
    <p>“The ques­tion is...how do we forge com­mon cause and find com­mon ground, and I think as lead­ers, that to us is the re­spon­si­bil­ity we have to un­der­take.”</p>
