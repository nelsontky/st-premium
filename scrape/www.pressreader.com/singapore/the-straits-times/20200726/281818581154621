    <p>Sin­ga­pore has not reached a pos­tra­cial state, so there are strong gov­ern­ment ef­forts and strict laws to en­sure racial and re­li­gious har­mony.</p>
    <p>But go­ing for­ward, younger Sin­ga­pore­ans must de­cide where to draw the bound­aries on dis­cus­sions on race and re­li­gion, and lead groundup ef­forts to bring these dif­fi­cult con­ver­sa­tions into their re­spec­tive com­mu­ni­ties, said Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In his open­ing re­marks at an on­line di­a­logue or­gan­ised by OnePeo­ple.sg, a na­tional body that pro­motes racial and re­li­gious har­mony, Mr Shan­mugam said the frame­work within which Sin­ga­pore has han­dled race re­la­tion­ships has worked well.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, in a 2016 Gallup World Poll, Sin­ga­pore ranked top out of more than 140 coun­tries for tol­er­ance of eth­nic mi­nori­ties.</p>
    <p>But race and re­li­gion re­main fault lines and are emo­tive is­sues, and con­ver­sa­tions must be man­aged with care, Mr Shan­mugam said.</p>
    <p>“Just be­cause you have dis­course, doesn’t mean you’re go­ing to au­to­mat­i­cally find the an­swers. You need the dis­course, but you need it in a safe en­vi­ron­ment. At the same time, the Gov­ern­ment needs to take ac­tion against peo­ple who are ag­i­tat­ing or fo­ment­ing racial dis­cord.”</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing about 120 young peo­ple, he said that while there are strict laws in place – such as the Main­te­nance of Re­li­gious Har­mony Act, which was up­dated last year – it is im­por­tant for younger Sin­ga­pore­ans to come for­ward and set up com­mu­nity-led ini­tia­tives, and the Gov­ern­ment will be happy to sup­port them.</p>
    <p>“We will em­power you, even if it’s just 10, 50 peo­ple work­ing to­gether to try and bring about change. We can talk about racism, we can talk about class con­scious­ness, and we can prop­a­gate these ideas into your com­mu­ni­ties,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It must be led by you, not the Gov­ern­ment. The Gov­ern­ment can help and sup­port, but we need you to come in too.”</p>
    <p>He also urged them to think about how they want to han­dle racial sen­si­tiv­i­ties go­ing for­ward, bear­ing in mind that this is a dif­fi­cult is­sue all around the world.</p>
    <p>“Even in Latin Amer­ica, with the same re­li­gion and same race, there is a dif­fer­en­ti­a­tion be­tween those who are lighter and those who are darker-skinned. So you get this (dis­crim­i­na­tion) in many ways, and you’re not go­ing to erad­i­cate it.”</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam ac­knowl­edged that while older Sin­ga­pore­ans are less com­fort­able dis­cussing race is­sues in pub­lic, younger Sin­ga­pore­ans are more will­ing to have such con­ver­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>“The only ques­tion is whether there should be bound­aries. What do you think should be the lim­its of of­fen­sive speech, or speech that runs down other races or re­li­gions? Our cur­rent po­si­tion is ‘noth­ing’ – you can­not make deroga­tory re­marks,” he said.</p>
    <p>But if younger Sin­ga­pore­ans think the cur­rent ap­proach should be changed, they may also want to con­sider whether there is a dif­fer­ence be­tween eth­nic mi­nori­ties us­ing racial ep­i­thets and slurs against eth­nic ma­jori­ties, ver­sus the other way around, he said.</p>
    <p>They must also think about the po­ten­tial trade-offs. “Based on what our young peo­ple think, then we’ll have to de­cide what our laws ought to be,” the min­is­ter said.</p>
    <p>A di­a­logue par­tic­i­pant, cit­ing re­cent in­ci­dents in­volv­ing Ms Raeesah Khan of the Work­ers’ Party and lo­cal YouTu­ber Preeti­pls, sug­gested that mi­nori­ties here may per­ceive un­equal treat­ment by the law.</p>
    <p>He pointed out that a con­tro­ver­sial rap video last year – made by Ms Preeti Nair, known as Preeti­pls, in re­sponse to a “brown­face” ad­ver­tise­ment – was taken down, while the ad it­self was given a stern warn­ing.</p>
    <p>The reg­u­la­tors had said that while the ad did not breach the In­ter­net Code of Prac­tice, it was done in poor taste and caused of­fence to mi­nori­ties.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam ex­plained that the brown­face ad was not a crim­i­nal of­fence, as whether a Chi­nese ac­tor plays an In­dian, or an In­dian plays a Chi­nese, is not some­thing that the au­thor­i­ties pre­vent.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, a Chi­nese con­trac­tor in the lo­cal com­edy se­ries, Phua Chu Kang, was played by Gur­mit Singh, an ac­tor of Pun­jabi her­itage.</p>
    <p>What the law pre­vents, Mr Shan­mugam said, is peo­ple say­ing “nasty” things, such as us­ing fourlet­ter words against other races.</p>
    <p>“Do we want that? What do you think should be the lim­its?</p>
    <p>“And I mean it in all se­ri­ous­ness, be­cause young peo­ple have to de­cide what the na­ture of the dis­cus­sion should be.”</p>
    <p>On Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat’s re­marks at a fo­rum last year that Sin­ga­pore is not ready for a non-Chi­nese PM (prime min­is­ter), another par­tic­i­pant asked how he could jus­tify this to his friends, that it is only a statis­tic, and not the Gov­ern­ment’s of­fi­cial po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam said that his vi­sion is of a Sin­ga­pore where the colour of one’s skin does not mat­ter when peo­ple think of a PM.</p>
    <p>“That is the ul­ti­mate ideal of a mer­i­to­cratic so­ci­ety, and one where we have the high­est ideals of mul­tira­cial­ism,” he said, adding that the key con­sid­er­a­tion should be whether the per­son can do the job.</p>
    <p>“It shouldn’t mat­ter what your skin colour is and what your cul­ture is, be­cause you’re Sin­ga­porean first.”</p>
    <p>He also said DPM Heng’s com­ment should be taken in con­text. A 2016 sur­vey by the In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies found that the ma­jor­ity of Sin­ga­pore­ans pre­fer the coun­try’s top lead­ers to be of the same race as them­selves, with the sen­ti­ment markedly stronger among re­spon­dents aged 50 and above.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam asked young peo­ple to share more of their views, with OnePeo­ple.sg to fa­cil­i­tate another di­a­logue later this year.</p>
    <p>He also chal­lenged them to reach out to their own com­mu­ni­ties, such as by form­ing groups to en­gage fel­low stu­dents on race at­ti­tudes and the kind of lan­guage they want to see in these con­ver­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>“Our task is to work to­wards hav­ing a change of these per­cep­tions, where race mat­ters less and less, and we be­come colour blind, a pos­tra­cial so­ci­ety – we’re not there yet,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It will re­quire hard work by the Gov­ern­ment and ev­ery­one who is in­ter­ested in these is­sues.”</p>
