    <p>Su­perPark Sin­ga­pore, one of the big­gest in­door play­grounds here, closed down last Thurs­day af­ter less than two years of op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Its land­lord, Sun­tec City mall, con­firmed the clo­sure. “We took pos­ses­sion of the Su­perPark premises on Oct 8 as the op­er­a­tor was not able to come up with a con­crete plan to restart op­er­a­tions,” said Mr An­thony Yip, deputy chair­man of APM Prop­erty Man­age­ment, the prop­erty man­ager of Sun­tec City.</p>
    <p>The Busi­ness Times re­ported on Sept 29 that the park’s hold­ing com­pany, Su­perPark Asia Group, is un­der in­terim ju­di­cial man­age­ment with $18 mil­lion in li­a­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Its clo­sure fol­lows in the foot­steps of other at­trac­tions for kids such as Kidza­nia Sin­ga­pore in Sen­tosa and Cool De Sac, also in Sun­tec City, which both shut­tered in June due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Span­ning 40,000 sq ft across two lev­els, Su­perPark Sin­ga­pore is the lo­cal out­post of a pop­u­lar Fin­nish in­door ac­tiv­ity park. It opened on Nov 17, 2018, and catered to both adults and chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Other ma­jor in­door play­grounds in Sin­ga­pore that have re­opened in­clude Kiz­topia at Ma­rina Square, Ama­zo­nia at Great World City and Waka Waka at An­nex@Fu­rama.</p>
    <p>Mr Yip said that APM is re­view­ing var­i­ous op­tions for the Sun­tec space, in­clud­ing leas­ing it to other in­door play op­er­a­tors or con­vert­ing it into a play area for shop­pers.</p>
    <p>He added: “We will also con­sider invit­ing the in­terim ju­di­cial man­ager of Su­perPark to sub­mit a pro­posal to restart op­er­a­tions if they choose to.”</p>
    <p>The Straits Times has con­tacted Su­perPark Sin­ga­pore and its Fin­nish par­ent com­pany for com­ment. They did not re­spond by press time.</p>
