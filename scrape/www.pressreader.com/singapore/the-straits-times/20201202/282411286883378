    <p>LON­DON • When Ful­ham were awarded a penalty in the 36th minute at Le­ices­ter on Mon­day, fans watch­ing at home might have been in­clined to avert their gaze.</p>
    <p>So lam­en­ta­ble has the Cot­tagers’ re­cent record from the spot been that hav­ing a penalty awarded in their favour has be­come a poi­soned chalice for who­ever lines up the shot.</p>
    <p>Be­fore Mon­day, Ful­ham had failed to con­vert five of their last eight penalty kicks in the Premier League, in­clud­ing their last three. Three weeks ago Ade­mola Look­man had left man­ager Scott Parker fum­ing af­ter at­tempt­ing a “Pa­nenka” in stop­page time when trail­ing 1-0 to West Ham.</p>
    <p>Then, in their last game, a 3-2 de­feat by Ever­ton, Ivan Cavaleiro slipped in his run-up and kicked the ball against his stand­ing foot and watched in hor­ror as his at­tempt bal­looned over the cross­bar.</p>
    <p>So when he took hold of the ball on Mon­day, the stage was set for an­other en­try into the “how not to take a penalty” cat­a­logue.</p>
    <p>In­stead, he drilled a firm ef­fort past Kasper Sch­me­ichel to dou­ble Ful­ham’s lead given to them by Look­man.</p>
    <p>Parker could not hide his relief as Ful­ham won 2-1 to move out of the rel­e­ga­tion zone into 17th spot.</p>
    <p>“We’ve prac­tised penal­ties all week, I asked (Cavaleiro) yes­ter­day if he’s ready to take one to­mor­row,” the man­ager said.</p>
    <p>“He looked me dead in the eye and said, ‘yeah, I’m ready’. The courage, the brav­ery af­ter a slip, to step up there, they’re the things that we need.</p>
    <p>“They’re the things that will de­ter­mine how good th­ese play­ers will be­come, and us as a team, what we’ll be­come.”</p>
    <p>Le­ices­ter man­ager Bren­dan Rodgers, whose team re­mained fourth, ad­mit­ted that Ful­ham were wor­thy win­ners.</p>
    <p>He said: “We’re dis­ap­pointed, mis­takes were made in the first half. We had a lot more of the ball but lacked cre­ativ­ity. I thought Ful­ham de­served to win it, they had more en­ergy in the first half and pounced on our mis­takes.”</p>
    <p>In an­other match on Mon­day, West Ham climbed to fifth with a 2-1 vic­tory over As­ton Villa.</p>
