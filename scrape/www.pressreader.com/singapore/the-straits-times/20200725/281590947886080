    <p>It has been a while since the Demo­cratic Party has had a new idea that was also a good idea. Mr Joe Bi­den’s for­eign pol­icy think­ing demon­strates the point, says Adam Garfin­kle (be­low).</p>
    <p>De­spite what the polls are say­ing, Mr Joe Bi­den may not be­come the 46th pres­i­dent of the United States on Jan 20, 2021. But he might, so it’s worth pon­der­ing some of the im­pli­ca­tions for US for­eign pol­icy.</p>
    <p>Start by not­ing that Mr Bi­den’s rep­u­ta­tion is mixed. He long served on the Sen­ate For­eign Re­la­tions Com­mit­tee be­fore be­com­ing vice-pres­i­dent, so pre­sum­ably has gained much ex­pe­ri­ence since en­ter­ing the Sen­ate via the 1972 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Yet when for­mer sec­re­tary of de­fence Robert Gates – a Repub­li­can then work­ing for a Demo­cratic ad­min­is­tra­tion, and so bap­tised into ob­jec­tiv­ity – quipped some years back that Mr Bi­den had been wrong on every ma­jor Cold War is­sue, most hoary Wash­ing­ton heads nod­ded as­sent.</p>
    <p>When I worked briefly as a</p>
    <p>Sen­ate staffer in the late 1970s, Mr Bi­den’s rep­u­ta­tion for teeth-clack­ing gaffes, generic bab­bling and sin­cere ge­nial­ity, which com­bined to cre­ate an op­tic of a gen­eral lack of grav­i­tas, was shared across the board.</p>
    <p>But that was 40 years ago; what mat­ters is Mr Bi­den’s cur­rent views. We know some­thing about them thanks both to his en­dur­ing vol­u­bil­ity and be­cause his long-time aide Antony Blinken – who rode that re­la­tion­ship into be­com­ing deputy sec­re­tary of state in the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion – re­cently spoke of things hope­fully to come with The Wall Street Jour­nal’s Wal­ter Rus­sell Mead.</p>
    <p>THE STATE­CRAFT FOR­MULA</p>
    <p>Mark first that, to its credit, Team Bi­den thinks in terms of state­craft.</p>
    <p>State­craft and diplo­macy are of­ten taken for synonyms; they aren’t. Diplo­macy con­cerns only re­la­tions with other states; state­craft con­cerns the con­scious in­te­gra­tion of do­mes­tic and for­eign pol­icy as­sets, so is prior to and es­sen­tial for diplo­macy.</p>
    <p>Here’s the larger in­sight put sim­ply: No great power can have a co­her­ent for­eign pol­icy un­less it has a strat­egy, for pol­icy is a means to achieve strate­gic ob­jec­tives. But strat­egy in turn rests on clar­ity about higher-level goals: What kind of na­tion in the world do Amer­i­cans want to be, and what kind of so­ci­ety do they wish to build at home? These ques­tions are ul­ti­mately in­sep­a­ra­ble, and the an­swers to them con­sti­tute in turn the foun­da­tion for strat­egy and, af­ter it, pol­icy.</p>
    <p>So what is Mr Bi­den’s state­craft think­ing? It is clas­sic Demo­cratic Party old-think held to heart with clas­sic Amer­i­can can-do op­ti­mism.</p>
    <p>Its do­mes­tic pol­icy ba­sis stip­u­lates a reg­u­lated mar­ket econ­omy, a same-size or larger (hence more ex­pen­sive) gov­ern­ment, and an op­er­a­tional po­lit­i­cal pal­ette that in­cludes all hues of key cen­tre-left Demo­cratic Party in­ter­est groups.</p>
    <p>This for­mula is pre­sumed able to gen­er­ate broad eco­nomic growth, keep party frac­tures from widening be­yond re­pair, and so serve as the do­mes­tic ba­sis for un­der­writ­ing the ex­er­cise of lib­eral in­ter­na­tion­al­ism abroad.</p>
    <p>But this is a ver­sion of lib­eral in­ter­na­tion­al­ism with re­al­ist bal­last. A Catholic with a Je­suit ed­u­ca­tion, Mr Bi­den is no mag­i­cal thinker. He knows that mul­ti­lat­eral in­ter­na­tional in­sti­tu­tions do not pro­duce peace, but rather that peace un­der­writ­ten by lib­eral-minded pow­ers pro­duces mul­ti­lat­eral in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>Thus, while his pref­er­ence is for kind and gen­tle diplo­macy over the co­er­cive va­ri­ety, a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion would dis­play and de­ploy mil­i­tary means when ab­so­lutely nec­es­sary. That pos­ture is the right for­mula for bring­ing most of the world’s ma­jor states into good-enough align­ment with core US ob­jec­tives. So the essence: In this field of for­eign pol­icy dreams, if you re­build it, they will come.</p>
    <p>In other words, Mr Bi­den be­lieves that all the pieces nec­es­sary to an ef­fec­tive post-Trump pol­icy are and have re­mained in place all along. The prob­lem has not been</p>
    <p>China’s rise or Rus­sia’s stealthy White House-pro­tected re­vi­sion­ism, or any change in the nor­ma­tive con­text of in­ter­na­tional pol­i­tics. It has been only the ab­sence of in­dis­pens­able US sup­port for the sys­tem that Amer­i­can power and per­sis­tence birthed af­ter World War II.</p>
    <p>The corol­lary, un­stated as­sump­tion: The Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion’s for­eign pol­icy was fine; no prob­lems there.</p>
    <p>What about the big-pic­ture “to do” list?</p>
    <p>Sim­ple: Strengthen the ex­ist­ing al­liance sys­tem – ex­pand­ing it as nec­es­sary and pos­si­ble – and marshal it to de­ter bad and in­cen­tivise good be­hav­iour on the part of China, Rus­sia, North Korea, Iran and other po­ten­tial trou­ble­mak­ers. Use the sys­tem, too, to han­dle global chal­lenges that tran­scend the con­ven­tional state-cen­tric sys­tem.</p>
    <p>IN­TEN­TIONS AND OUT­COMES</p>
    <p>There’s noth­ing wrong with the in­ten­tion here, and op­ti­mism, an old boss of mine liked to say, is in­deed a force mul­ti­plier.</p>
    <p>It’s cer­tainly a vast im­prove­ment over the past nearly four years, which are aptly char­ac­terised as ei­ther strate­gi­cally in­co­her­ent, or as hav­ing been driven to what­ever co­her­ence can be dis­cerned by the pique and pathol­ogy of a man never fit to be pres­i­dent in the first place.</p>
    <p>But in­ten­tions are not out­comes, and op­ti­mism is not a pol­icy. Alas, all the premises of the Bi­den ap­proach are ques­tion­able.</p>
    <p>The con­vic­tion that es­tab­lish­ment Democrats can suc­cess­fully buy off or oth­er­wise dom­i­nate the bur­geon­ing “woke” fac­tion of the party is a toss-up in the emer­gent Amer­i­can cul­tural con­text, which is char­ac­terised by rolling moral pan­ics and widening ide­o­log­i­cal fis­sures within the Demo­cratic Party.</p>
    <p>The as­sump­tion that eco­nomic growth of a mag­ni­tude and a kind that is more class-bal­anced, and hence so­cially sta­bil­is­ing and of ser­vice to Demo­cratic Party con­stituen­cies, can be elicited from the cur­rent plu­to­cra­tised struc­ture of the US po­lit­i­cal econ­omy – a con­di­tion for which both Demo­cratic and Repub­li­can elites are re­spon­si­ble – is also du­bi­ous.</p>
    <p>The fact is, too, that the pre­cur­sor US grand strat­egy has not been in mere sus­pended an­i­ma­tion since Jan­uary 2017.</p>
    <p>The pol­icy Mr Bi­den wants to re­sus­ci­tate started fray­ing al­ready in Novem­ber 1989, when the Ber­lin Wall fell, and frayed fur­ther af­ter the Sept 11, 2001 at­tacks, mainly for lack of a uni­tary ide­o­log­i­cal ad­ver­sary to sus­tain it. The cu­mu­la­tive re­sult to the panorama of US for­eign pol­icy, al­ready man­i­fest dur­ing the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion?</p>
    <p>In Europe, the las­si­tude that has come to char­ac­terise the transat­lantic re­la­tion­ship can­not be reme­died in the con­text of a vir­tu­ally lead­er­less Euro­pean Union now forced to con­front its own ex­is­ten­tial dilem­mas.</p>
    <p>In Asia, the in­her­ent loose­ness of the Cold War-era US al­liance sys­tem could not have coped any­way with the fact that Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s China is not that of Deng Xiaop­ing, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jin­tao. It is not only richer and stronger; it is also both dif­fer­ently minded about the world be­yond its bor­ders and ar­guably less sta­ble in­ter­nally at the same time.</p>
    <p>A STRAT­EGY TOO FAR</p>
    <p>Most im­por­tant, Mr Bi­den’s pol­icy con­cept is linked, at least by</p>
    <p>Cold War-era brain-mus­cle habit, to the suc­cess­ful grand strat­egy of pro­vid­ing se­cu­rity goods to the global com­mons.</p>
    <p>That strat­egy still com­mends it­self, even be­yond its dated ori­gins: Sup­press­ing re­gional se­cu­rity com­pe­ti­tions, their weapons-of-mass-de­struc­tion ac­qui­si­tion itches with them, pro­motes peace and hence en­ables the ex­pan­sion of a pros­per­ity-gen­er­at­ing lib­eral trad­ing or­der.</p>
    <p>But an al­liance-based strat­egy of pro­vid­ing se­cu­rity goods to the global com­mons re­quires two con­di­tions to be sta­ble over time, and nei­ther is in prospect.</p>
    <p>First, every so of­ten Amer­i­can power must be used, and used ef­fec­tively, for its cred­i­bil­ity de­pends on the sagac­ity of the judg­ment in choos­ing to wield Amer­i­can strength as well as on that strength it­self. Al­lies, ad­ver­saries and by­standers alike need to be re­minded oc­ca­sion­ally that the United States has thick skin in the game.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, Amer­i­can pol­icy must be sus­tained at home by cred­i­ble at­tes­ta­tions that the pol­icy en­folds a morally tran­scen­dent pur­pose. Amer­ica will not en­gage in a sus­tained man­ner in the face of sac­ri­fice and dan­ger solely for pur­poses of ex­tended self-de­fence and lu­cre. Here the real prob­lems with Team Bi­den’s op­ti­mism emerge.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can power has not been demon­strated ef­fec­tively in re­cent years, and its mil­i­tary might, while im­pres­sive on pa­per, is in­creas­ingly less so upon ob­jec­tive close inspection where it re­ally mat­ters – say, around China’s lit­toral.</p>
    <p>Suc­ces­sive US ad­min­is­tra­tions have un­der-cap­i­talised the coun­try’s navy and air force, the two key in­stru­ments of the US for­ward-de­ployed grand strat­egy.</p>
    <p>A Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will cut the de­fence bud­get sig­nif­i­cantly for a clutch of po­lit­i­cal, fi­nan­cial and tem­per­a­men­tal rea­sons. Nor can it com­pen­sate for less money with a less crony­ism-af­flicted ac­qui­si­tion sys­tem that pro­duces de­fi­cient de­ploy­ment pos­tures – in­clud­ing that of the Sev­enth Fleet. That is an achieve­ment far be­yond the reach of quick fixes.</p>
    <p>Just one de­bac­u­lar use of US mil­i­tary power un­der a pres­i­dent Bi­den, es­pe­cially in Asia, could crash the en­tire pre­tence of the strat­egy, and the as­so­ci­ated pol­icy meant to ad­vance it.</p>
    <p>More daunt­ing, Amer­i­cans to­day be­lieve on bal­ance that Amer­i­can so­ci­ety it­self lacks virtue, and hence any right to a share of global lead­er­ship. The na­tion is again re­hears­ing its Jeremiad script, as it does from time to time. Its ide­al­ist civil-re­li­gion gods have sprouted feet of clay; ex­cep­tion­al­ist claims have not sounded from the Oval Of­fice now for many years. Amer­ica is there­fore turned de­cid­edly, in­sis­tently in­ward, search­ing to re­store a work­ing con­sen­sus on higher-level goals.</p>
    <p>NEEDED: NEW THINK­ING</p>
    <p>For these rea­sons, the wise US grand strat­egy of old, based on an en­light­ened con­cept of US self-in­ter­est that sought to do good and well si­mul­ta­ne­ously, is at least for the time be­ing not res­ur­rectable. To evade this truth is to al­low op­ti­mism to de­cay into nostal­gia. It is also to beg for nasty sur­prises.</p>
    <p>US lead­ers need new think­ing for new cir­cum­stances. Repub­li­cans have no ideas, only ir­ri­ta­ble men­tal ges­tures mas­querad­ing as ideas; and, un­for­tu­nately, it’s been many years since the Demo­cratic Party has had a gen­uinely new idea that was also a good idea.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s for­eign pol­icy think­ing demon­strates the point. That its be­nign mo­tives and op­ti­mism trump the sta­tus quo of the Trump era just goes to show what a roiled mess US for­eign pol­icy is ac­tu­ally in.</p>
