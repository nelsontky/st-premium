    <p>Dr Leroy Sims, the med­i­cal di­rec­tor of the Na­tional Basketball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA), joined front-line health­care work­ers in Cal­i­for­nia in getting the Covid-19 Pfizer vac­cine last week.</p>
    <p>He was among 148 res­pi­ra­tory ther­a­pists, reg­is­tered nurses, and doc­tors to get the jab at the Mill­sPenin­sula Med­i­cal Cen­tre in Burlingame, Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>“For me, this has been a long­time com­ing,” Sims, who prac­tises emer­gency medicine at the hos­pi­tal as well, said.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been deal­ing with the pan­demic from Jan 4 in terms of in­form­ing the NBA and friends and fam­ily, and fol­lowed it re­ally closely.</p>
    <p>“So to be at this point, there’s no anx­i­ety what­so­ever. I’m re­ally proud to be at this place.”</p>
    <p>His vac­cine came just days be­fore the reg­u­lar sea­son tips off to­day.</p>
    <p>A hand­ful of teams, in­clud­ing the Or­lando Magic, At­lanta Hawks, Mem­phis Griz­zlies and Utah Jazz, are al­low­ing a lim­ited num­ber of fans into their are­nas for the first time since March. Fans of the other teams may have to wait.</p>
    <p>“Re­ally it’s go­ing to be based on what the US looks like. The north­east looks dif­fer­ent from the south-east looks dif­fer­ent from the west,” he added.</p>
    <p>“And what the case bur­den is, pos­i­tiv­ity rates. So un­til we get the green light from the Depart­ment of Pub­lic Health and in those ar­eas where we’re not al­lowed to have fans, we won’t. But to the ex­tent that we can do it and do it safely, we will.”</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, the league re­mains fo­cused on keep­ing play­ers safe, rec­om­mend­ing that they con­tinue to wear masks and keep phys­i­cal dis­tances and will also con­tinue its deep test­ing pro­to­cols, Sims, who also man­aged the bio-se­cure bub­ble in Or­lando, said.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the league and the Na­tional Basketball Play­ers As­so­ci­a­tion, al­most 9 per cent of play­ers tested pos­i­tive be­fore train­ing camps opened ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>Back in late June, just over 5 per cent tested pos­i­tive be­fore they gath­ered in Florida, where teams fin­ished out the sea­son in the bub­ble.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the league’s three-month stay at Dis­ney World, not a sin­gle player or coach tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 af­ter the virus de­railed the sea­son in March for four months.</p>
    <p>As the vac­cine roll-out con­tin­ues into the new year, Sims re­vealed that the NBA would be wait­ing for health­care work­ers, the vul­ner­a­ble, and any nec­es­sary es­sen­tial work­ers to get vac­ci­nated be­fore its play­ers and staff.</p>
    <p>“In every­thing that we do, we have an eye on so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity. So we’re not jump­ing the line,” he said.</p>
    <p>“When the op­por­tu­nity comes for us to roll it out in a larger way to our play­ers and to our staff, we’ll do that.</p>
    <p>“But we’re not go­ing to do that be­fore the nec­es­sary es­sen­tial work­ers get vac­ci­nated.”</p>
