    <p>Stress is not nec­es­sar­ily a bad thing – it is cru­cial in help­ing us to be­come more ef­fi­cient, pro­duc­tive and ef­fec­tive. But what hap­pens when stress threat­ens to over­whelm your life?</p>
    <p>You do not have to move moun­tains to ad­min­is­ter a dose of self­love and self-care, es­pe­cially in these try­ing times. There are many ways to man­age your mood and di­rect your fo­cus onto what is most im­por­tant – your­self.</p>
    <p>Three well­ness ex­perts share the best ways to cope with stress be­fore you hit break­ing point.</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>SHOW YOUR­SELF SOME TLC</p>
    <p>The first step to prac­tis­ing self­care? Be­ing kinder to your­self.</p>
    <p>“Stop feel­ing guilty for tak­ing care of your­self,” says clin­i­cal psy­chol­o­gist Joanne Chua of Mind What Mat­ters Psy­cho­log­i­cal Con­sul­tancy, who adds that you can­not pour from an empty cup.</p>
    <p>“Sched­ule time in your cal­en­dar to nour­ish your body and mind. It should look like a bal­anced overview of your life, rather than an over­whelm­ing list of to-dos ev­ery time you open your cal­en­dar.”</p>
    <p>And give the T.I.E. method a go. “Ad­just the way you per­ceive fail­ures and chal­lenges, based on the sci­ence of pos­i­tive psy­chol­ogy. Train your­self to view set­backs as Tem­po­rary (rather than per­ma­nent fix­tures), Iso­lated to that par­tic­u­lar in­ci­dent (not per­va­sive), and that they can be over­come with Ef­fort,” she adds.</p>
    <p>2 3</p>
    <p>KEEP UP WITH HEALTHY HABITS POS­I­TIVE THINK­ING</p>
    <p>Un­doubt­edly, our phys­i­cal well­ness im­pacts our men­tal well­be­ing in a big way, and that in­cludes reg­u­lar phys­i­cal ac­tiv­i­ties, proper nutri­tion and health­care.</p>
    <p>But for the busy ur­ban­ite, it is easy to rel­e­gate things like ex­er­cise or healthy eat­ing to the back burner.</p>
    <p>Cer­ti­fied per­sonal trainer Mitch Hyde, who is also co-owner and gym man­ager of Spar­tans Box­ing Club (Seran­goon Gar­dens), says: “Strong, pos­i­tive habits will have a long-last­ing ef­fect, not just on self­care, but also on your en­tire life­style. It usu­ally takes 21 days to form new habits, and the side ef­fects can add years to your life.”</p>
    <p>Good habits to adopt, he adds, in­clude drink­ing wa­ter reg­u­larly, do­ing breath­ing ex­er­cises, get­ting out­side reg­u­larly and stretch­ing.</p>
    <p>For psy­chother­a­pist Stephen Lew, who is also a coach and founder of The School of Pos­i­tive Psy­chol­ogy, one daily habit to in­clude is to fo­cus on your breath­ing.</p>
    <p>“Start breath­ing i n and out slowly, in through your nose and out from your mouth, let­ting your breath flow ef­fort­lessly in and out of your body. One cy­cle should last ap­prox­i­mately six sec­onds.</p>
    <p>“Let go of your thoughts, all the things you have on your plate, and the stress that you may have un­con­sciously col­lected in your neck and shoul­der. No­tice how your breath ex­pands and con­tracts your chest and stom­ach, and how it en­ters and leaves your body.”</p>
    <p>Pos­i­tive emo­tions like j oy help im­prove the im­mune sys­tem, as well as help an in­di­vid­ual be­come more cre­ative, so­cia­ble, trust­ing, com­pas­sion­ate and re­silient, notes Mr Lew.</p>
    <p>But stress, frus­tra­tion and neg­a­tiv­ity are part and par­cel of be­ing hu­man. And it is next to im­pos­si­ble to re­main cheer­ful all the time.</p>
    <p>“Neg­a­tive thoughts are nor­mal and okay,” Mr Hyde says. “But in­stead of get­ting down on your­self, a pos­i­tive mind­set could be, ‘Okay, this hap­pened. How can I grow from this?’ or ‘What is the next best-case sce­nario in my sit­u­a­tion?’”</p>
    <p>Ms Chua shares the same sen­ti­ment. “Savour the pos­i­tive, no mat­ter how small; our brain has an in­her­ent neg­a­tiv­ity bias, and we over-learn from painful events and don’t learn enough from pos­i­tive ones.</p>
    <p>“Bring more mind­ful­ness to your daily ac­tiv­i­ties, es­pe­cially the ones that feel good. Start jour­nal­ing all the pleas­ant events that hap­pen through­out the day.”</p>
    <p>She adds that this could be slowly savour­ing a warm cup of tea, be­ing grate­ful for a seat on the MRT, or rel­ish­ing a shared smile with your spouse or lit­tle ones be­fore you start work.</p>
    <p>She says: “Neu­ro­science re­search demon­strates that con­sis­tently do­ing this for 21 days in a row can tip your brain into a pos­i­tive bias.”</p>
    <p>Al­ways jot­ting down ap­point­ments and tasks? Start in­ten­tion­ally plan­ning for joy in­stead.</p>
    <p>Mr Lew says when a per­son plans for joy, he or she com­mits to en­gage pos­i­tive emo­tions or cre­ate mean­ing­ful con­nec­tions with others.</p>
    <p>“A ‘j oy ac­tiv­ity’ could be any­thing, like strolling in the park, shar­ing a joke or try­ing out new food stores with a loved one, shar­ing a grat­i­tude note, spend­ing time amid na­ture, or car­ing for a pet or a plant,” he adds.</p>
    <p>“When peo­ple plan for joy, they also nur­ture an in­ter­est and cu­rios­ity to try new things, and are more likely to put aside time for per­sonal well-be­ing.”</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>THE POWER OF KIND­NESS</p>
    <p>It never hurts to spread a lit­tle kind­ness, and en­gag­ing in acts of co­op­er­a­tion and al­tru­ism can in­crease your sense of well-be­ing too.</p>
    <p>Mr Lew sug­gests choos­ing one day a week to per­form five acts of kind­ness.</p>
    <p>He says: “They should be be­hav­iours that can ben­e­fit other peo­ple or make others happy; it could be do­nat­ing blood, help­ing a friend with a chore, vis­it­ing an el­derly rel­a­tive or a friend who needs en­cour­age­ment, or writ­ing a thank you note to a for­mer em­ployer or teacher. This im­pacts our sat­is­fac­tion with life, hap­pi­ness and well­be­ing.”</p>
