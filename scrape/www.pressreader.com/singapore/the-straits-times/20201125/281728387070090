    <p>With sev­eral pi­lot events un­der way and oth­ers to come, Sin­ga­pore’s meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­ven­tions and ex­hi­bi­tions (Mice) in­dus­try is gear­ing up to en­sure that the Repub­lic re­tains its po­si­tion as a lead­ing Mice hub.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts said that there is a first­mover ad­van­tage to be cap­tured, and Sin­ga­pore’s han­dling of the coro­n­avirus cri­sis means that it is ready to re­in­force its po­si­tion as a global Mice des­ti­na­tion, but with the nec­es­sary pre­cau­tions in place.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) is cur­rently pro­cess­ing up to 50 ap­pli­ca­tions to hold pi­lot Mice events with up to 250 par­tic­i­pants each. At least 20 pi­lot events have been ap­proved so far.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­ca­tions opened early last month, with event or­gan­is­ers re­quired to com­ply with strict safe man­age­ment mea­sures and guide­lines.</p>
    <p>The pi­lot events like last month’s Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional En­ergy Week and the up­com­ing Trav­elRe­vive, where pro­to­types such as meet­ing pods for Mice events are put in place, pro­vide in­sights that en­able mea­sures and guide­lines to be re­fined, said Dr Ed­ward Koh, ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of con­ven­tions, meet­ings and in­cen­tive travel at STB.</p>
    <p>Pi­lot anti­gen rapid test­ing for Covid-19 will be scaled up at Trav­elRe­vive to pave the way for larg­er­scale events to be held, and spe­cial travel itin­er­ar­ies will be cu­rated for the event’s at­ten­dees in prepa­ra­tion for the even­tual re­sump­tion of leisure travel in Sin­ga­pore, he said.</p>
    <p>SEC­TOR’S IM­POR­TANCE</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic has con­sis­tently ranked among the best Mice cities in the world and Asia-Pa­cific, with cities such as Bangkok, Shang­hai and Tokyo also pop­u­lar among event or­gan­is­ers, ob­servers said.</p>
    <p>Mr Teh Seng Leong, global real es­tate, hos­pi­tal­ity and con­struc­tion merg­ers and ac­qui­si­tions leader at pro­fes­sional ser­vices firm EY, said: “Sin­ga­pore’s Mice sec­tor has its strengths in the avail­abil­ity of large spa­ces, rel­a­tive prox­im­ity to the Cen­tral Busi­ness Dis­trict from meet­ing venues, and in­te­grated mixed-use venues in­cor­po­rat­ing re­tail, ho­tels and food and bev­er­age, all of which will be strong con­sid­er­a­tions for meet­ing or­gan­is­ers.”</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lawrence Loh from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s busi­ness school said that the coun­try is well po­si­tioned to cap­ture the de­mand for Mice events – which have been hit by the Covid-19 cri­sis – given its han­dling of the coro­n­avirus out­break thus far.</p>
    <p>“It’s very crit­i­cal for Sin­ga­pore to cap­ture the lost op­por­tu­ni­ties from the past few months while de­mand is still there and un­ful­filled, es­pe­cially while other coun­tries may not be ready to ex­pand and move for­ward be­cause of Covid-19 or other fac­tors,” he said, adding that events must be done safely.</p>
    <p>He added that if Sin­ga­pore does not do so, it could run the risk of event or­gan­is­ers turn­ing their at­ten­tion to other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Dr Michael Chiam, a se­nior tourism lec­turer at Ngee Ann Polytech­nic, said the hy­brid form that Mice events will prob­a­bly take in the post-Covid-19 econ­omy could pro­vide an op­por­tu­nity for in­dus­try play­ers to cap­ture a larger au­di­ence across the world.</p>
    <p>“The in­dus­try will have to lever­age tech­nol­ogy in or­der to stay ahead of the curve,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mice play­ers are ex­plor­ing tech­nolo­gies such as Web con­fer­enc­ing plat­forms and aug­mented re­al­ity ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The Mice sec­tor sup­ported more than 34,000 jobs and con­trib­uted an eco­nomic value-add of $3.8 bil­lion, or nearly 1 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct, ac­cord­ing to a sur­vey com­mis­sioned by the STB last year.</p>
    <p>Dr Koh said: “Be­yond the tan­gi­ble eco­nomic ben­e­fits, Mice is cen­tral to our po­si­tion as a global busi­ness hub and key node within Asia.”</p>
    <p>BUILD­ING CON­FI­DENCE</p>
    <p>Not­ing how Sin­ga­pore’s Mice in­dus­try is largely de­pen­dent on in­ter­na­tional events, Dr Chiam said: “It is crit­i­cal that we build con­fi­dence among par­tic­i­pants – both lo­cal res­i­dents and in­ter­na­tional trav­ellers – that it is safe to at­tend Mice events in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Putting in place mea­sures like pre-event test­ing and us­ing the TraceTo­gether app or to­ken for con­tact trac­ing helps to en­sure a safe vis­i­tor ex­pe­ri­ence and build con­fi­dence in the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Mr Aloy­sius Ar­lando, pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore As­so­ci­a­tion of Con­ven­tion and Ex­hi­bi­tion Or­gan­is­ers and Sup­pli­ers, said that Sin­ga­pore’s lack of a do­mes­tic mar­ket has pushed the in­dus­try to be even more cre­ative and find in­no­va­tive ways of en­gag­ing with au­di­ences over dig­i­tal plat­forms.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, last month’s In­dus­trial Trans­for­ma­tion Asia-Pa­cific event at the Sin­ga­pore Expo also saw the use of a Web plat­form which al­lowed event par­tic­i­pants to net­work with one another and ex­plore a 3D smart fac­tory.</p>
    <p>Mr Ar­lando, who is also the chief ex­ec­u­tive of events or­gan­iser SingEx Hold­ings, ac­knowl­edged that while chal­lenges for the in­dus­try re­main, es­pe­cially with cash­flow con­sid­er­a­tions and rev­enue not coming in, in­dus­try play­ers are re­main­ing re­silient and putting cost man­age­ment mea­sures in place to po­si­tion them­selves as best as they can.</p>
    <p>“For­ward-look­ing, pro­gres­sive com­pa­nies... want to be as­so­ci­ated with part­ners who are path-break­ing, who look at push­ing the bound­aries and yet are able to be trusted. I think that’s the brand value that Sin­ga­pore brings,” he said.</p>
