    <p>•</p>
    <p>MI­AMI/PHILADEL­PHIA Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Joe Bi­den on Thurs­day crit­i­cised what he called Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s “pan­icked” re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, while Mr Trump de­fended his han­dling of a cri­sis that has killed over 220,000 Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>The ri­vals spoke in si­mul­ta­ne­ous town halls broad­cast on sep­a­rate tele­vi­sion net­works af­ter a de­bate orig­i­nally sched­uled for Thurs­day was called off fol­low­ing Mr Trump’s Covid-19 di­ag­no­sis.</p>
    <p>The split-screen show­down of­fered a stark re­minder of the many ways the cam­paign sea­son has been changed by a pan­demic that has prompted more than 18 mil­lion peo­ple to cast bal­lots more than two weeks be­fore the Nov 3 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, speak­ing to vot­ers in Philadel­phia on ABC, blamed the Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent for con­ceal­ing the dead­li­ness of the virus. “He said he didn’t tell any­body be­cause he was afraid Amer­i­cans would panic,” Mr Bi­den said. “Amer­i­cans don’t panic. He pan­icked.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump de­fended both his re­sponse to the pan­demic as well as his own per­sonal con­duct, in­clud­ing stag­ing a Rose Garden event at the White House where few wore masks or prac­tised so­cial dis­tanc­ing, which re­sulted in nu­mer­ous at­ten­dees con­tract­ing the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>“Hey, I’m Pres­i­dent – I have to see peo­ple, I can’t be in a base­ment,” Mr Trump said on NBC in front of an out­door au­di­ence of vot­ers in Mi­ami, im­plic­itly crit­i­cis­ing Mr Bi­den for spend­ing months off the cam­paign trail as the pan­demic raged.</p>
    <p>He did not an­swer ques­tions about the last time he tested neg­a­tive be­fore con­tract­ing the virus, say­ing he did not re­call pre­cisely.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, who ag­gres­sively in­ter­rupted Mr Bi­den dur­ing a chaotic de­bate two weeks ago, showed lit­tle in­ter­est in al­ter­ing his bel­liger­ent tone, spar­ring fre­quently with mod­er­a­tor Sa­van­nah Guthrie.</p>
    <p>He said he “heard dif­fer­ent sto­ries” about the ef­fi­cacy of masks, even though his own ad­min­is­tra­tion’s pub­lic health ex­perts have said wear­ing them is key to stop­ping the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump also de­clined to de­nounce QAnon, the false con­spir­acy the­ory that Democrats are part of a global pae­dophile ring, first prais­ing its ad­her­ents for op­pos­ing pae­dophilia be­fore say­ing he knew noth­ing about the move­ment.</p>
    <p>He also dodged ques­tions about a New York Times in­ves­ti­ga­tion of two decades of his tax re­turns, which he has re­fused to re­lease pub­licly de­spite decades of prece­dent for pres­i­den­tial can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>HID­ING THE TRUTH</p>
    <p>He said he didn’t tell any­body be­cause he was afraid Amer­i­cans would panic. Amer­i­cans don’t panic. He pan­icked.</p>
    <p>DEMO­CRATIC PRES­I­DEN­TIAL CAN­DI­DATE JOE BI­DEN, blam­ing Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump for con­ceal­ing the virus’ dead­li­ness.</p>
    <p>DID NOTH­ING WRONG</p>
    <p>Hey, I’m Pres­i­dent – I have to see peo­ple, I can’t be in a base­ment.</p>
    <p>PRES­I­DENT DON­ALD TRUMP, de­fend­ing his per­sonal con­duct, in­clud­ing stag­ing a Rose Garden event at the White House where few wore masks or prac­tised so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>He ap­peared to con­firm the pa­per’s re­port that he has some US$400 mil­lion (S$543 mil­lion) in per­son­ally guar­an­teed loans, ar­gu­ing that the amount was a “peanut” com­pared with his worth.</p>
    <p>He also did not deny the Times’ re­port that he paid only US$750 in fed­eral in­come tax dur­ing his first year in the White House, although he said at one point the pa­per’s num­bers were “wrong”.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond pres­i­den­tial de­bate had orig­i­nally been sched­uled for Thurs­day, but Mr Trump pulled out of the event af­ter or­gan­is­ers de</p>
    <p>cided to turn it into a virtual af­fair fol­low­ing his di­ag­no­sis two weeks ago.</p>
    <p>A fi­nal de­bate is still sched­uled for Oct 22 in Nashville, Ten­nessee.</p>
    <p>North Carolina, a highly com­pet­i­tive state, saw huge lines as it be­gan more than two weeks of in-per­son early vot­ing on Thurs­day, fol­low­ing record turnouts in Ge­or­gia and Texas ear­lier in the week.</p>
    <p>Some 18.3 mil­lion Amer­i­cans have voted ei­ther in per­son or by mail so far, rep­re­sent­ing 12.9 per cent of the to­tal votes counted in the 2016 gen­eral elec­tion, ac­cord­ing to the US Elec­tions Project at the Uni­ver­sity of Florida.</p>
    <p>The two pres­i­den­tial can­di­dates were set to re­turn to the cam­paign trail yes­ter­day with Mr Trump trav­el­ling to Florida and Ge­or­gia, two states that are seen as cru­cial to his chances of vic­tory, and Mr Bi­den vis­it­ing two cities in Michi­gan, another bat­tle­ground state.</p>
