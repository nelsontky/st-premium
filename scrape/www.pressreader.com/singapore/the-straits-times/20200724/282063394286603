    <p>We thank Mr Ge­orge Lee for his feed­back (Cost of hear­ing aids and spec­ta­cles a bur­den for seniors,</p>
    <p>July 15).</p>
    <p>We recog­nise that some seniors may re­quire as­sis­tive de­vices, such as hear­ing aids and spec­ta­cles, to en­joy a bet­ter qual­ity of life.</p>
    <p>To sup­port these seniors, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) pro­vides el­i­gi­ble Sin­ga­pore­ans aged 60 years and above with means-tested sub­si­dies to off­set the cost of as­sis­tive de­vices and home health­care items through the Seniors’ Mo­bil­ity and En­abling Fund (SMF).</p>
    <p>To­day, more than 90 per cent of the seniors who re­ceive an SMF sub­sidy for their first set of hear­ing aids will see the sub­sidy cov­er­ing most of the de­vice’s cost.</p>
    <p>We un­der­stand that even as SMF sub­si­dies pri­mar­ily sup­port seniors with the pur­chase of their first de­vice, there may be in­stances where seniors need to pur­chase a re­place­ment but have no fi­nan­cial means to do so. We will as­sess such ap­pli­ca­tions for re­place­ment de­vices on a case-by-case ba­sis, tak­ing into ac­count the se­nior’s cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>MOH has part­nered with Te­masek Foun­da­tion to roll out func­tional screen­ing in the com­mu­nity via Project Sil­ver Screen (PSS) for Sin­ga­pore­ans aged 60 and above. Un­der PSS, seniors who are as­sessed to re­quire hear­ing aids and/or spec­ta­cles will re­ceive cor­po­rate vouch­ers, which can be used on top of the SMF sub­sidy to fur­ther de­fray the out-of-pocket costs of the de­vices.</p>
    <p>Seniors who face dif­fi­cul­ties in ac­quir­ing as­sis­tive de­vices may ap­proach their med­i­cal in­sti­tu­tions or visit any AIC (Agency for In­te­grated Care) Link for ad­vice and as­sis­tance. Fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance is avail­able for those who have fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties.</p>
    <p>MOH reg­u­larly re­views our sup­port mea­sures, to en­sure that they con­tinue to meet the needs of Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>I am a reg­u­lar li­brary­goer, and re­cently learnt that some of my favourite li­brary books are go­ing to be phased out.</p>
    <p>Out of cu­rios­ity, I con­tacted the Na­tional Li­brary Board (NLB) to find out if I could pur­chase the books. NLB replied in an e-mail that out­dated books are not for sale, with­out giv­ing a rea­son.</p>
    <p>NLB used to hold an an­nual Li­brary Book Sale, which was well-re­ceived by the pub­lic. Why has it been dis­con­tin­ued? And what will hap­pen to li­brary books that are phased out, if they are not for sale?</p>
    <p>I am heart­ened to know that the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) is work­ing with banks to wean com­pa­nies and in­di­vid­u­als off the re­lief mea­sures rolled out dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic (MAS to help peo­ple, firms ease de­pen­dence on re­lief mea­sures, July 17).</p>
    <p>The re­lief mea­sures can­not last for­ever. Con­sider in­cen­tives such as three to six months of in­ter­est-free re­pay­ments for bor­row­ers.</p>
    <p>By dif­fer­en­ti­at­ing an em­bat­tled bor­rower from the other bor­row­ers, a tar­geted ap­proach may then be adopted for em­bat­tled bor­row­ers, which may in­clude ex­ten­sion of a debt mora­to­rium or a longer re­pay­ment pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, not all com­pa­nies will be able to stay afloat. Banks may need higher pro­vi­sion for bad debts.</p>
    <p>NOT ALL FIRMS CAN BE SAVED</p>
    <p>I un­der­stand that many em­ploy­ees, in­clud­ing those work­ing at statu­tory boards, are cur­rently work­ing from home. But tele­phone calls to said statu­tory boards should still be an­swered promptly and du­ti­fully.</p>
    <p>Since April, I have tried call­ing Sport Sin­ga­pore’s phone num­bers, as well as the phone num­bers of Ac­tiveSG swim­ming com­plexes, but the phone ei­ther rings with no one pick­ing up the call, or I hear an en­gaged tone.</p>
    <p>What other means of com­mu­ni­ca­tion are avail­able if calls are not be­ing an­swered?</p>
    <p>I agree with Mr Kevin Chua Hock Meng (Char­ac­ter and cit­i­zen­ship ed­u­ca­tion of­ten ne­glected in schools, July 23). I find that the schools here may not re­ally en­force char­ac­ter and cit­i­zen­ship ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Also, one thing that should be ad­dressed is the need to ed­u­cate chil­dren to be more in­clu­sive and tol­er­ant to­wards oth­ers who are “dif­fer­ent”, such as chil­dren who are so­cially awk­ward, who are on the autis­tic spec­trum, or who suf­fer from ADHD (at­ten­tion deficit hy­per­ac­tiv­ity dis­or­der) and other neu­ro­log­i­cal chal­lenges. Teach­ing chil­dren not to bully and to stand up for those who are vul­ner­a­ble is key in build­ing char­ac­ter and cit­i­zen­ship.</p>

    <p>CALLS NOT BE­ING AN­SWERED</p>
    <p>David Kwok Ng Kan</p>
    <p>TEACH KIDS TO BE IN­CLU­SIVE</p>
    <p>I re­cently called a bank to in­quire about a per­sonal loan. From the next day, I be­gan to re­ceive mes­sages and calls from un­known num­bers of­fer­ing loans from money­len­ders, a flood that lasted for al­most three weeks.</p>
    <p>I can’t help but won­der if the two are con­nected. Do banks main­tain cus­tomer con­fi­den­tial­ity?</p>
    <p>Florence Beck­mann</p>
    <p>DID BANK LEAK IN­FOR­MA­TION?</p>
