    <p>New Zealand Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern, who led her party to vic­tory at the polls yes­ter­day, de­scribed it as a strong win that al­lows Labour to push ahead for a quick eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>With 99 per cent of the bal­lots counted last night, Labour was ex­pected to pick up 64 of the 120 seats in Par­lia­ment, with 35 for the main op­po­si­tion Na­tional Party, 10 each for the Greens and the ACT Party, and one seat for the Maori Party.</p>
    <p>She said in a vic­tory speech last night: “We will be a party that gov­erns for ev­ery New Zealan­der.</p>
    <p>“Now more than ever is the time to keep go­ing, to keep work­ing.”</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern’s vic­tory was cred­ited to sup­port for her swift moves to quell the Covid-19 out­break. She im­posed one of the world’s most strin­gent lock­downs. As at yes­ter­day, the coun­try, which has about five mil­lion res­i­dents, had recorded 1,883 cases and just 25 deaths.</p>
    <p>New Zealand Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern yes­ter­day de­liv­ered the big­gest elec­tion vic­tory for her Labour Party in half a cen­tury, lead­ing her party to an out­right ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>It is the first party to achieve this feat since the coun­try adopted a pro­por­tional vot­ing sys­tem in 1996.</p>
    <p>To form the gov­ern­ment, a party needs to win 61 of 120 seats.</p>
    <p>But since the mixed mem­ber pro­por­tional sys­tem was in­tro­duced in which each voter has two votes – a party vote and an elec­torate vote – no party has been able to do so on its own.</p>
    <p>De­liv­er­ing an up­beat vic­tory speech last night, Ms Ardern said Labour’s strong win – its best re­sult in decades – would al­low it to ac­cel­er­ate its re­sponse to the coron­avirus pan­demic and push ahead for a quick and trans­for­ma­tive eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>But she sig­nalled that she in­tended to adopt a cen­trist agenda, even though her cen­tre-left party will now be able to pass leg­is­la­tion unim­peded.</p>
    <p>“We will be a party that gov­erns for ev­ery New Zealan­der,” she said.</p>
    <p>“We will govern as we cam­paigned – pos­i­tively, with op­ti­mism… Now more than ever is the time to keep go­ing, to keep work­ing.”</p>
    <p>Labour re­ceived 49 per cent of the vote, com­pared with 27 per cent for the op­po­si­tion Na­tional Party.</p>
    <p>Labour is ex­pected to pick up 64 of the 120 seats in Par­lia­ment, with 35 for Na­tional, 10 each for the Green and the ACT par­ties, and one seat for the Maori Party.</p>
    <p>The New Zealand First party, which is cur­rently in the rul­ing coali­tion and is led by For­eign Min­is­ter Win­ston Peters, failed to win a seat.</p>
    <p>Since her sur­prise suc­cess at the 2017 elec­tion, Ms Ardern, 40, has won ac­claim for her em pa­thetic re­sponses to the Christchur­ch ter­ror­ist at­tack, in which a white su­prem­a­cist killed 51 peo­ple at two mosques, and to a deadly vol­canic erup­tion on White Is­land.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, Ms Ardern moved swiftly to quell the out­break by im­pos­ing one of the world’s most strin­gent lock­downs. As at yes­ter­day, the coun­try of about five mil­lion res­i­dents recorded 1,883 cases and just 25 deaths.</p>
    <p>Aside from curb son in­ter­na­tional trav­ellers, life has re­turned to nor­mal and re­stric­tions have largely been re­moved.</p>
    <p>Cam­paign­ing on the slo­gan “Build back bet­ter”, Ms Ardern promised to fo­cus on eco­nomic re­cov­ery but pro­moted rel­a­tively mod­est poli­cies.</p>
    <p>She pledged to sup­port small busi­nesses, boost vo­ca­tional train­ing, in­vest in in­fra­struc­ture, ad­dress child poverty, and adopt tougher mea­sures to re­duce car­bon emis­sions and sup­port re­new­able en­ergy.</p>
    <p>She said the world was in­creas­ingly po­larised but New Zealand’s polls had shown that dis­agree­ments could be set­tled civilly, with­out ex­ac­er­bat­ing di­vi­sions. “Elec­tions aren’t al­ways great at bring­ing peo­ple to­gether, but they also don’t need to tear one an­other apart.”</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cam­paign, Na­tional’s leader Ju­dith Collins at­tacked Ms Ardern over her han­dling of Covid-19 quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties, sug­gest­ing this led to a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>She also said Labour would sup­port the Green Party’s wealth tax on high-earn­ing New Zealan­ders – a claim Ms Ardern re­jected.</p>
    <p>Ms Collins last night con­grat­u­lated Ms Ardern on an “out­stand­ing” re­sult. “Na­tional will re-emerge from this loss a stronger, dis­ci­plined and more con­nected party,” she said. “I prom­ise you, the Na­tional Party will be a ro­bust op­po­si­tion.”</p>
    <p>Be­fore the 2017 elec­tion, Ms Ardern, a young and rel­a­tively un­known leader, stunned the na­tion dur­ing the cam­paign as she gained huge per­sonal sup­port in a phe­nom­e­non la­belled “Jacin­da­ma­nia”.</p>
    <p>Her win last night showed that the ma­nia has con­tin­ued, and per­haps grown more fer­vent among the coun­try’s 3.5 mil­lion vot­ers.</p>
    <p>Yet, she now faces the un­en­vi­able task of ad­dress­ing a coun­try that is in the grip of a se­vere eco­nomic down­turn.</p>
    <p>Sus­tain­ing the ma­nia in her sec­ond three-year term may prove more dif­fi­cult than dur­ing her first.</p>
