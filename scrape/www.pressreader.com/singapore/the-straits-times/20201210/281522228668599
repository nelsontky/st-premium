    <p>More than 1,600 pas­sen­gers who were aboard the Royal Caribbean’s Quan­tum of the Seas cruise ship dis­em­barked last night in an hours­long process that be­gan nearly 12 hours af­ter the ship re­turned to Sin­ga­pore a day ahead of sched­ule.</p>
    <p>The four-day cruise to nowhere was cut short by a day af­ter an 83-year-old pas­sen­ger tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19. How­ever, two sub­se­quent tests con­ducted by the Na­tional Pub­lic Health Lab­o­ra­tory came back last night with neg­a­tive re­sults – sug­gest­ing the ini­tial test could be a false pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>By then, the dis­em­barka­tion process was well un­der way, with the first pas­sen­gers seen leav­ing the ship, berthed at the Ma­rina Bay Cruise Cen­tre, at around 7.50pm.</p>
    <p>Pas­sen­gers had their tem­per­a­tures taken be­fore leav­ing the ves­sel. They were placed in groups – com­pris­ing 10 to 25 peo­ple – with spe­cific de­par­ture times to re­duce crowd­ing. The last groups dis­em­barked around mid­night.</p>
    <p>Mov­ing in an orderly fash­ion with their bags, they made their way to the cruise cen­tre, where they had to take an anti­gen rapid test and were then free to go.</p>
    <p>Pas­sen­gers were told they would be no­ti­fied within an hour if their re­sults were pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Flight stew­ard Leon Chen, 31, who dis­em­barked at around 8pm, told re­porters the process went smoothly.</p>
    <p>He took about 10 to 15 min­utes to leave the ves­sel, in­clud­ing the time re­quired for the test.</p>
    <p>“There were many at­ten­dants and staff who helped to guide us from our room to the gang­way,” said Mr Chen, who was on the cruise with his girl­friend Lim Jia Yee, 30, a flight stew­ardess.</p>
    <p>How­ever, travel writer Heidi Sarna, 54, said that though she was told to be ready to leave at 7.30pm, she dis­em­barked only at 9pm.</p>
    <p>“There was a bit of a bot­tle­neck in the cor­ri­dors on the ship. An attendant had to tell some of us to go back into the rooms, so that helped the sit­u­a­tion,” said Ms Sarna, an Amer­i­can who has been liv­ing in Sin­ga­pore for 15 years.</p>
    <p>On the neg­a­tive retests, she said: “It’s frus­trat­ing and dis­ap­point­ing that all this may have hap­pened for noth­ing. But you also re­alise there’s noth­ing you can do about it, and I can’t fault any­body for this.”</p>
    <p>Though they were con­fined to their rooms since 2.45am yes­ter­day, pas­sen­gers said they were well taken care of.</p>
    <p>Stu­dent de­vel­op­ment of­fi­cer Muham­mad Rezal Ramli, 40, said his fam­ily of four was given “two rounds of break­fast” and sev­eral large bot­tles of wa­ter.</p>
    <p>“I think eight peo­ple could eat the amount of food we had,” he joked.</p>
    <p>He added that the cruise – his fam­ily’s first – was en­joy­able, though the early end was dis­ap­point­ing.</p>
    <p>Teacher Kelvin Cheng, 31, was on the cruise with his wife and daugh­ter, and dis­em­barked at 10.45pm.</p>
    <p>He was frus­trated by the turn of events, say­ing: “This had been a long-awaited hol­i­day for us, and we un­der­stand the need (for) safety mea­sures... But now that this case has tested neg­a­tive, it makes us ques­tion the re­li­a­bil­ity of the PCR test on board.”</p>
    <p>Ms Ame­line Yan, 29, who works in real es­tate, said she was not up­set. “It was bet­ter to err on the side of cau­tion... A mi­nor in­con­ve­nience is bet­ter than if it had turned out to be an out­break.”</p>
