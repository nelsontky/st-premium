    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON Ruth Bader Gins­burg be­came a hero­ine to the Amer­i­can left af­ter over­com­ing en­trenched sex­ism in the legal pro­fes­sion to as­cend to the US Supreme Court, where she cham­pi­oned gen­der equal­ity and other lib­eral causes dur­ing 27 years on the bench.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Gins­burg, who died on Fri­day at age 87 of com­pli­ca­tions from pan­cre­atic cancer, was a fierce ad­vo­cate for women’s rights – win­ning ma­jor gen­der-dis­crim­i­na­tion cases be­fore the Supreme Court – be­fore be­ing ap­pointed to the top US ju­di­cial body in 1993 by then Pres­i­dent Bill Clin­ton. The diminu­tive dy­namo be­came the court’s lead­ing lib­eral voice.</p>
    <p>Ris­ing from a work­ing class fam­ily in Brook­lyn, she over­came hos­til­ity to­wards women in the male-dom­i­nated worlds of law school and the legal pro­fes­sion to be­come just the sec­ond woman ever to serve on the nine-mem­ber Supreme Court.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing her fi­nal years on the court, she be­came some­thing of a pop icon for Amer­i­can lib­er­als, the sub­ject of the 2018 fea­ture film On The Ba­sis Of Sex, the 2018 Os­carnom­i­nated doc­u­men­tary RBG, and</p>
    <p>sketches on the pop­u­lar TV show Satur­day Night Live, even in­spir­ing an ac­tion fig­ure.</p>
    <p>Her small stature – she stood at 1.55m – and frailty in later years be­lied an out­sized per­sona and clout.</p>
    <p>Fans called her “The No­to­ri­ous R.B.G.”, in­spired by the late Amer­i­can rap­per The No­to­ri­ous B.I.G.</p>
    <p>“I ask no favour for my sex. All I ask of our brethren is that they take their feet off our necks,” Jus­tice Gins­burg said in the doc­u­men­tary.</p>
    <p>She was a re­li­able vote in favour of lib­eral causes on the court on other is­sues as well, in­clud­ing de­fend­ing abor­tion rights, ex­pand­ing gay rights, pre­serv­ing the Oba­macare health­care law, and ad­vanc­ing the rights of racial mi­nori­ties, the poor and dis­en­fran­chised.</p>
    <p>Her death gives Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump the op­por­tu­nity to make his third ap­point­ment to the court and ex­pand its con</p>
    <p>ser­va­tive ma­jor­ity to 6-3.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Gins­burg had ex­pe­ri­enced a se­ries of health is­sues. In July, she dis­closed she had a re­cur­rence of cancer af­ter bouts with pan­cre­atic cancer in 2009 and last year. She also sur­vived bouts with lung cancer in 2018 and colon cancer in 1999.</p>
    <p>For­mer pres­i­dent Jimmy Carter made Jus­tice Gins­burg a fed­eral ap­pel­late judge in 1980 and Mr Clin­ton el­e­vated her to the Supreme Court 13 years later.</p>
    <p>She joined Jus­tice San­dra Day O’Con­nor, who be­came the first woman jus­tice in 1981, on the bench. Dur­ing her ten­ure, two more women were named to the high court: So­nia So­tomayor and Elena Ka­gan. When asked how many women there should be on the court, Jus­tice Gins­burg, with an imp­ish smile, al­ways gave the same an­swer: “Nine.”</p>
