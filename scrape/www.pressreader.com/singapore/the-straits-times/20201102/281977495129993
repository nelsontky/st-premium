    <p>Yan­the No­bel walks through the rain­for­est, look­ing for a car­cass. Re­ports of a dead ele­phant, ly­ing in a stream, have reached camp and her job is to fig­ure out what killed it. It’s not the poach­ers she is wor­ried about – they are in­creas­ingly rare here in the Dzanga-Sangha Spe­cial Re­serve in the Cen­tral African Repub­lic. It is the pathogens.</p>
    <p>When she and her col­leagues find the dead ele­phant, it turns out to be a baby, less than a year old. Dr</p>
    <p>No­bel dresses in full pro­tec­tive gear – gown, face shield, gloves – and starts tak­ing sam­ples. “An­thrax is very com­mon around here,” she says, re­fer­ring to the deadly bac­terium that lives in soil as one pos­si­ble cul­prit. “It could also be that its mother was poached,” she tells me over Skype, back in camp.</p>
    <p>Dr No­bel, a vet and PhD stu­dent in epi­demi­ol­ogy, has come to Dzanga-Sangha to study viruses, mainly in bats and ro­dents. Ele­phants are not usu­ally part of the job – but when a dead an­i­mal is found in the for­est, she al­ways per­forms a necropsy.</p>
    <p>If the cause of death isn’t ob­vi­ous, and none of the usual pathogens shows up in the field lab, the sam­ples are sent on to a big­ger lab in Ger­many. “You al­ways look for some­thing new,” she says. In the big­ger lab, the sam­ples are tested for un­known viruses – pathogens that have not been seen be­fore.</p>
    <p>Hunt­ing for new viruses has be­come more dif­fi­cult dur­ing an ac­tual pan­demic, but it has never been more im­por­tant. This year,</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has brought some of the most pow­er­ful coun­tries in the world to their knees. Like most other novel hu­man viruses, Sars-CoV-2, which causes</p>
    <p>Covid-19, is zoonotic: It crossed from an­i­mals into hu­mans. In this case, prob­a­bly from a bat to a per­son, or through an in­ter­me­di­ary an­i­mal.</p>
    <p>“As a vet­eri­nar­ian, I am al­ready trained to see the dan­ger of spillovers from an­i­mals to peo­ple,” says Dr No­bel, who stud­ies at the Robert Koch In­sti­tute’s Leen­dertz Lab, which spe­cialises in the ecol­ogy of zoonotic dis­ease. Covid-19 has put this in the spot­light, she adds. “Peo­ple are wak­ing up to a story that was al­ready there.”</p>
    <p>For years, epi­demi­ol­o­gists and the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion planned for the ad­vent of an un­known ill­ness – of­ten re­ferred to as “Dis­ease X”. It would be highly con­ta­gious, not pre­vi­ously iden­ti­fied and cause a ma­jor in­ter­na­tional epi­demic.</p>
    <p>In other words: a lot like Covid-19. But even though ev­ery­one knew some­thing like this might come along, no one found it un­til the virus had al­ready in­fected dozens of peo­ple in Wuhan, China.</p>
    <p>Zoonotic viruses are re­spon­si­ble for a long list of ill­nesses: the hu­man im­mun­od­e­fi­ciency virus (HIV), Ebola, the se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome (Sars), Zika and swine flu, to name just a few. And more are emerg­ing all the time – each year, be­tween two and five new zoonotic viruses are dis­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>This year alone has seen sev­eral zoonotic out­breaks in ad­di­tion to Covid-19. There was an Ebola surge in the Demo­cratic Repub­lic of</p>
    <p>Congo – where the dis­ease has claimed thou­sands of lives – and a spike in Lassa fever cases in Nige­ria. Over the past three decades, out­breaks of zoonotic dis­ease have in­creased.</p>
    <p>DE­FOR­ESTA­TION DAN­GERS</p>
    <p>The dis­eases don’t emerge from just any­where. Of­ten they come from rain­for­est edges and places of great di­ver­sity, where hu­mans and an­i­mal species are min­gling. Th­ese “hot spots”, where dis­eases are more likely to spill over from an­i­mals to hu­mans, are closely linked to en­vi­ron­men­tal change such as de­for­esta­tion.</p>
    <p>“Trop­i­cal rain­forests are ex­cep­tion­ally im­por­tant in this re­gard,” says Dr Tom Gille­spie, who leads a lab study­ing pathogens and en­vi­ron­men­tal change at Emory Univer­sity. “Here you have a di­ver­sity of bats, ro­dents, pri­mates – the species where we are most likely to con­tract some­thing – you are go­ing to have a di­ver­sity of pathogens as well.”</p>
    <p>The ac­tual work of hunt­ing for viruses is tough. Dr No­bel has just re­turned to base af­ter two weeks of catch­ing bats at a bush camp, and shows me the deep scratches around her an­kles from walk­ing through the for­est. Sleep­ing in tents, show­er­ing un­der a wa­ter­fall and stay­ing clear of the ele­phant herds can make for ex­haust­ing days.</p>
    <p>This year, Covid-19 has made things even harder for her and other re­searchers. Though there have not yet been any cases in this corner of the Cen­tral African Repub­lic, the lo­cal lab is equipped to run poly­merase chain re­ac­tion tests for the virus, and re­searchers are tak­ing ex­tra pre­cau­tions, in­clud­ing wear­ing masks around the great apes, who could be at risk of catch­ing Covid-19 from hu­mans.</p>
    <p>This is one of the most re­mote forests of Africa, but the re­search is cen­tral to un­der­stand­ing our chang­ing re­la­tion­ship to na­ture and dis­ease. Cli­mate change adds com­plex­ity to this task, as in­sects shift their ranges and plants bear fruit at dif­fer­ent times, cre­at­ing more po­ten­tial for new species to mix. But if we knew more about viruses – how they act and which an­i­mals they in­fect – could it equip us bet­ter the next time a “Dis­ease X” comes around?</p>
    <p>VI­RAL DAN­GERS</p>
    <p>Viruses have been on the planet for mil­lions of years, much longer than Homo sapi­ens. Not quite tech­ni­cally “alive”, a virus is a strand of ge­netic code en­closed in a pro­tein sheath and needs a liv­ing host to re­pro­duce. We know about only a tiny frac­tion of the viruses in the world, although the work of find­ing them has sped up re­cently with the ad­vent of ge­netic se­quenc­ing. There are about 1.6 mil­lion viruses on the planet in mam­mals and birds, of which about 700,000 could have the po­ten­tial to in­fect hu­mans. But of th­ese, only about 250 have been iden­ti­fied in hu­mans. The rest are still out there – they just haven’t made the leap.</p>
    <p>One of the world’s most prom­i­nent virus-hunters is Pro­fes­sor Peter Piot, who co-dis­cov­ered the Ebola virus in 1976. He ex­plains that viruses are so nim­ble be­cause they are al­ways look­ing for their next host.</p>
    <p>“What is the rai­son d’etre of a virus? It is to find a host to sur­vive,”</p>
    <p>he says. Viruses typ­i­cally lurk in a reser­voir host – a plant or an­i­mal that can har­bour them with­out get­ting sick – and then be­come more prob­lem­atic when they cross into a new species.</p>
    <p>Prof Piot, head of the Lon­don School of Hy­giene and Trop­i­cal Medicine, is con­cerned that the coron­avirus will not be our last deadly epi­demic.</p>
    <p>“We are liv­ing in the age of pan­demics,” he says, sound­ing a bit short of breath, a re­flec­tion of his own en­counter with Covid-19 ear­lier this year. “I think we are go­ing to see more and more of them, and the fun­da­men­tal rea­son is that we failed to live in har­mony with na­ture.”</p>
    <p>He points to the fac­tors that make dis­ease emer­gence more likely, such as de­for­esta­tion and the il­le­gal trade in wild an­i­mals. Forests cover about a third of land on earth, but they are be­ing cut down, of­ten to make way for cash crops or cat­tle farm­ing. Ev­ery minute, forests the size of 35 foot­ball pitches are cleared.</p>
    <p>“This prob­a­bly started al­ready when we be­came seden­tary, from no­mads,” Prof Piot says. “And I’m not say­ing we should go back and live like no­mads. But when you put it all to­gether – pop­u­la­tion pres­sure, ur­ban­i­sa­tion, agri­cul­tural prac­tices, de­for­esta­tion, high mo­bil­ity... and then cli­mate change is go­ing to make all th­ese things worse.”</p>
    <p>As the planet warms up, it is chang­ing the pat­terns of dis­ease. In­sects that carry zoonotic dis­eases, such as ticks and mos­qui­toes, are ex­pand­ing their range and mov­ing into new ar­eas. Lyme dis­ease is spread­ing into North Amer­ica and across Europe, re­cently prompt­ing the Euro­pean Cen­tre for Dis­ease Pre­ven­tion and Con­trol to launch a mon­i­tor­ing pro­gramme for the ill­ness, which is car­ried by ticks.</p>
    <p>Ex­treme weather events such as drought and flood­ing also have a big im­pact. For dis­eases like dengue fever, heavy rains make its spread more likely by cre­at­ing breed­ing grounds for the mos­quito that car­ries it. Last year there was a record num­ber of dengue cases in Latin Amer­ica – more than three mil­lion – amid con­cerns that cli­mate change will ex­ac­er­bate the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>VI­RAL DARK MAT­TER</p>
    <p>Dr Den­nis Car­roll has spent nearly his whole life look­ing for viruses and is lead­ing an am­bi­tious pro­ject to find more of them – all of them, in fact.</p>
    <p>He spent a decade lead­ing a US$200 mil­lion (S$273 mil­lion) virus-hunt­ing pro­gramme called “Pre­dict” at the United States Agency for In­ter­na­tional</p>
    <p>Devel­op­ment. Now he is the head of the Global Virome Pro­ject, a re­search group with a mis­sion to cat­a­logue all the viruses that could pose a threat to hu­man health.</p>
    <p>“The Global Virome Pro­ject is ba­si­cally about go­ing to the viruses be­fore they come to us, and put­ting to­gether a com­pre­hen­sive data­base,” he says. “If we had this data, we would have picked up Covid-19 in Oc­to­ber, for in­stance.”</p>
    <p>That’s a bold claim – but Dr Car­roll likes to dream big. He be­lieves our re­sponse to novel viruses is lim­ited be­cause we don’t know about them in ad­vance, be­fore they start in­fect­ing hu­mans. “What­ever the next event will be – and we know there will be an­other event – it’s al­ready out there,” he says. He refers to th­ese un­known viruses as “vi­ral dark mat­ter”.</p>
    <p>To build this data­base will be ex­pen­sive. Dr Car­roll es­ti­mates it would take about US$1.6 bil­lion and at least 10 years to find 75 per cent of the 1.6 mil­lion viruses – or, if they can raise the funds, about US$3 bil­lion to cap­ture 90 per cent of viruses. The Global Virome Pro­ject is work­ing on fund rais­ing from gov­ern­ments, phil­an­thropic foun­da­tions and tech com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>The pro­ject is con­sid­ered some­thing of a moon­shot in the sci­en­tific com­mu­nity: Even if all those viruses were iden­ti­fied, we might not be able to tell which ones are con­ta­gious and threat­en­ing to hu­mans.</p>
    <p>But sup­port­ers say that the re­search at Pre­dict has al­ready helped in the fight against Covid-19, and the Global Virome Pro­ject will too.</p>
    <p>“We dis­cov­ered more than 100 novel coro­n­aviruses, we also iden­ti­fied more than 60 known coro­n­aviruses and started to ex­pand dra­mat­i­cally the in­for­ma­tion on what hosts they’re in,” says pro­fes­sor of epi­demi­ol­ogy Jonna Mazet of the UC Davis School of Vet­eri­nary Medicine, who was the prin­ci­pal in­ves­ti­ga­tor for Pre­dict and is now on the board of the Global Virome Pro­ject.</p>
    <p>Some of those coro­n­aviruses were used to ex­am­ine whether the drug remde­sivir – cur­rently the only retro­vi­ral ap­proved for use against Covid-19 in the US – could be ef­fec­tive against the coron­avirus, she says, adding: “And even if it doesn’t help us pre­vent, it pre­pares us to have the data to be ready to jump into ac­tion.”</p>
    <p>STILL UN­KNOWN</p>
    <p>One thing that sci­en­tists agree on is just how lit­tle we know about what’s out there. We haven’t iden­ti­fied all the mam­mals on the planet, let alone all the viruses. And even the viruses we have iden­ti­fied of­ten re­main mys­te­ri­ous. Ebola is one ex­am­ple: Sci­en­tists have not been able to con­firm which an­i­mal the virus re­sides in. In­fluenza viruses are an­other: Be­cause they mu­tate so quickly, a broad vac­cine has never been pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery time we’re out there do­ing long-term sur­veil­lance, we’re find­ing new species of ver­te­brates,” says Dr Gille­spie. Take bats – about 1,400 species have been iden­ti­fied so far, and that num­ber goes up each year. Bats are par­tic­u­larly in­ter­est­ing to epi­demi­ol­o­gists, be­cause they har­bour so many viruses that can be harm­ful for hu­mans, in­clud­ing Sars and Ebola.</p>
    <p>Dr Gille­spie’s work fo­cuses on mon­keys and great apes, which of­ten act as sen­tinels for pathogens that im­pact hu­mans be­cause of their ge­netic sim­i­lar­ity to us. Some­times they can pass viruses to hu­mans – HIV crossed over from chim­panzees – but hu­mans can also pass viruses to apes.</p>
    <p>An­other thing sci­en­tists can agree on is that de­struc­tion of the nat­u­ral world makes it more likely that new viruses will emerge and spill over into hu­man pop­u­la­tions. Cut­ting down forests, plant­ing sin­gle-crop plan­ta­tions for palm oil and op­er­at­ing large live­stock farms can all in­crease hu­man con­tact with emerg­ing dis­eases.</p>
    <p>“It doesn’t mat­ter if you are a go­rilla or a hu­man, if you have a dis­turbed for­est, you have a shift,” says Dr Fabian Leen­dertz, head of the Leen­dertz Lab.</p>
    <p>An­other is­sue is land­scape frag­men­ta­tion: Dr Gille­spie’s re­search shows that a tip­ping point oc­curs when about 40 per cent of an area has been de­stroyed. “That’s when ev­ery­thing starts pour­ing out,” he says. “An­i­mals are be­hav­ing in very dif­fer­ent ways than they nor­mally would just to sur­vive. They’re look­ing for food.”</p>
    <p>THE GOOD NEWS</p>
    <p>With the world in the grip of the Covid-19 pan­demic, there is a fo­cus on find­ing so­lu­tions like never be­fore – and not just for this virus but for the viruses to come.</p>
    <p>Vac­cine re­search is one area al­ready ben­e­fit­ing from this surge in in­vest­ment – and an area where the hunt for new viruses could help in the long term. One group in this field is the Coali­tion for Epi­demic</p>
    <p>Pre­pared­ness In­no­va­tions (Cepi), which was set up with back­ing from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foun­da­tion to work on vac­cines for emerg­ing dis­eases. This year it is lead­ing the Covax ini­tia­tive, which is de­vel­op­ing a vac­cine for Sars-CoV-2. (Nine vac­cines are un­der devel­op­ment, of which eight are al­ready un­der­go­ing clin­i­cal tri­als.)</p>
    <p>Cepi’s direc­tor of vac­cine re­search Me­lanie Sav­ille strikes a rare note of op­ti­mism. “Sars-CoV-2 is an ex­am­ple where things are get­ting bet­ter all the time in terms of vac­cine devel­op­ment,” she says, adding that know­ing more about what viruses are out there is im­por­tant be­cause it can guide re­search.</p>
    <p>“There are a fi­nite num­ber of virus fam­i­lies, 25 or 26, and peo­ple do see that some of those fam­i­lies are more likely to have an emerg­ing epi­demic,” Dr Sav­ille says. “So work­ing on viruses in those fam­i­lies, you can learn an aw­ful lot, even if that isn’t an ex­act match of what will come in the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>When Sars-CoV-2 came along, pre­vi­ous re­search on Mers (Mid­dle East res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome), which is also caused by a type of coron­avirus, helped ac­cel­er­ate vac­cine devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Cepi and oth­ers are also try­ing to de­velop vac­cines that could tar­get en­tire fam­i­lies of viruses, though that goal has been elu­sive so far. Some­times the bar­ri­ers to devel­op­ment are not just sci­en­tific: Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies have been re­luc­tant to in­vest in vac­cines for dis­eases that im­pact poor and re­mote pop­u­la­tions. De­vel­op­ing fu­tur­is­tic broad vac­cines and cat­a­logu­ing ev­ery zoonotic virus on the planet are both com­pelling ideas – but many years away from be­com­ing re­al­ity.</p>
    <p>What else can be done in the mean­time? Ad­dress­ing the en­vi­ron­men­tal de­struc­tion at the root of many new dis­eases is one op­tion, al­beit a dif­fi­cult one. The log­ging of the Ama­zon rain­for­est – an­other hot spot for dis­ease emer­gence – is of par­tic­u­lar con­cern right now for ecol­o­gists and epi­demi­ol­o­gists.</p>
    <p>But two ap­proaches stand out that may be able to make a dif­fer­ence in the near term. One is to mon­i­tor hu­man health more closely in hot-spot ar­eas so that new dis­eases can be spot­ted and treated more quickly. An­other is to in­cor­po­rate ecol­ogy more closely into public health de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>Ty­ing hu­man health pro­grammes to­gether with wildlife mon­i­tor­ing is al­ready start­ing to hap­pen in some ar­eas. In some parts of Brazil, for ex­am­ple, pri­mates are tested for yel­low fever, so that hu­mans liv­ing nearby can be vac­ci­nated if nec­es­sary. Cli­mate pat­terns and sea­sonal weather vari­a­tions can be used to pre­dict the tim­ing and in­ten­sity of dis­eases such as dengue and cholera.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers on the front line say it is im­pos­si­ble to sep­a­rate hu­man health from the health of our nat­u­ral world. Pro­fes­sor Chris­tian Happi, head of the African Cen­tre of Ex­cel­lence for Ge­nomics of In­fec­tious Dis­eases in Ede, Nige­ria, is set­ting up an early-warn­ing pro­gramme that will de­tect dis­ease in hu­mans and re­port the find­ings to the lo­cal health au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think the next pan­demic is go­ing to be pre­dicted by some ma­chine learn­ing or some al­go­rithm,” says Prof Happi, a pro­fes­sor of molec­u­lar bi­ol­ogy, whose lab di­ag­nosed the first case of Ebola in Nige­ria. “You have to be on the ground. What is needed is to set up a very solid and strong sur­veil­lance sys­tem that en­ables peo­ple to de­tect th­ese pathogens in real time, and then make this in­for­ma­tion avail­able.”</p>
    <p>A re­cent pa­per in Science es­ti­mated that spend­ing about US$30 bil­lion an­nu­ally on mea­sures such as re­duc­ing de­for­esta­tion and curb­ing wildlife traf­fick­ing would pay for it­self many times over by de­creas­ing the risk of the next pan­demic. “A ma­jor ef­fort to re­tain in­tact for­est cover would have a large re­turn on in­vest­ment, even if its only ben­e­fit was to re­duce virus emer­gence events,” it stated.</p>
    <p>As the world fights on against Covid-19, re­searchers say that there are some sil­ver lin­ings. It has trig­gered a huge amount of in­vest­ment and re­search. Sci­en­tists are col­lab­o­rat­ing more across fields – crit­i­cal for an area such as zoonotic dis­ease, which cuts across ecol­ogy, epi­demi­ol­ogy and molec­u­lar bi­ol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Ad­vances in ge­netic se­quenc­ing could arm us bet­ter when the next virus ar­rives. And there is a fresh ac­knowl­edge­ment that hu­man health is deeply con­nected to the health of our planet.</p>
    <p>“A wake-up call is an un­der­state­ment,” says Prof Piot.</p>
    <p>“If Covid doesn’t do it, I don’t know what it will take.”</p>
    <p>KNOWL­EDGE OF VIRUSES KEY</p>
    <p>What­ever the next event will be – and we know there’ll be an­other event – it’s al­ready out there.</p>
