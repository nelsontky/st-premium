    <p>GANGHWA (South Korea) • When hiker Kim Kang-eun found the slopes of Mount Jiri, South Korea’s largest na­tional park, lit­tered with rub­bish dur­ing a two-day trip in 2018, she de­cided it was time to send out a mes­sage about tak­ing bet­ter care of na­ture.</p>
    <p>She founded Clean Hik­ers, a group ded­i­cated to pick­ing up trash from there and the coun­try’s other moun­tain parks, and turn­ing it into art.</p>
    <p>“Junk art is more com­pelling and well re­ceived by peo­ple, rather than just say­ing let’s not lit­ter. We can make an in­ter­est­ing im­age and it at­tracts peo­ple’s at­ten­tion,” Ms Kim, 30, said.</p>
    <p>ART­FUL AP­PROACH</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, she cre­ated with other mem­bers of the group a col­lage of a cry­ing cat tagged with the slo­gan “Save the Earth”, on the sum­mit of Mount Mani on Ganghwa Is­land, a park out­side Seoul where many stray cats roam.</p>
    <p>This and sim­i­lar col­lages of a fish, a bird, a but­ter­fly and a hu­man be­ing that the group has dis­played on moun­tain tops were made en­tirely from rub­bish, in­clud­ing a face mask.</p>
    <p>With curbs linked to Covid-19 re­strict­ing in­door ac­tiv­i­ties and large gath­er­ings, more South Kore­ans are spend­ing time out­doors.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of vis­i­tors to three ma­jor na­tional parks close to the coun­try’s big cities rose by more than 20 per cent in Oc­to­ber com­pared to the same month last year, ac­cord­ing to the Korea Na­tional Park Ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Vis­its to the 22 na­tional parks it man­ages gen­er­ated more than 800 tonnes of rub­bish in the first nine months, it added.</p>
    <p>While most of that rub­bish goes into bins, some does not, and Ms Kim is grate­ful for the new surge of in­ter­est in Clean Hik­ers that the pan­demic has also in­spired.</p>
    <p>“The more im­por­tant thing is to keep do­ing this ac­tiv­ity, tell peo­ple about this, and make more peo­ple join. This is much more cru­cial,” said Ms Kim.</p>
    <p>Junk art is more com­pelling and well re­ceived by peo­ple, rather than just say­ing let’s not lit­ter. We can make an in­ter­est­ing im­age and it at­tracts peo­ple’s at­ten­tion.</p>
