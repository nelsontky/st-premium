    <p>BARCELONA Dy­namo Kiev will take on Barcelona in their Cham­pi­ons League Group G tie to­day with­out nine of their players after sev­eral of them tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>“Due to pos­i­tive Covid-19 tests, a num­ber of players will not be able to help the team in Barcelona,” the Ukrainian side said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Among those who will be miss­ing at the Nou Camp in­clude goal­keep­ers Ge­orgiy Bushchan and Denys Boyko, de­fend­ers Vi­taliy Mykolenko and Oleksandr Kar­avaev, and mid­fielder Mykola Sha­parenko.</p>
    <p>Cap­tain Ser­hiy Sy­dorchuk is suspended after re­ceiv­ing a red card in their pre­vi­ous game at Ferenc­varos, while three other players – Mykyta Burda, Oleksandr Tym­chyk and Volodymyr Kostevych – are in­jured.</p>
    <p>Ajax were in the same predica­ment as the Dutch out­fit played Dan­ish side Midtjyl­land in Group D yes­ter­day with­out four key players in­clud­ing cap­tain Du­san Tadic and goal­keeper An­dre Onana. Two other reg­u­lar starters, mid­field­ers Davy Klaassen and Ryan Graven­berch, were omit­ted from their squad along with seven oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Teams in the Cham­pi­ons League must play, if they have 13 players (in­clud­ing one goal­keeper) avail­able.</p>
    <p>Ajax coach Erik ten Hag was vague about the Covid-19 clus­ter at his club due to “pri­vacy rea­sons”, but ad­mit­ted he had “a num­ber of players who did not get per­mis­sion to en­ter Den­mark”.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Uefa’s Covid-19 pro­to­cols, teams are obliged to play their matches as long as they have at least 13 players avail­able.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Barca plan to hold their pres­i­den­tial elec­tions in the fes­tive sea­son as the La Liga gi­ants try to re­build fol­low­ing the res­ig­na­tion of pre­vi­ous chief Josep Maria Bar­tomeu last week.</p>
    <p>As per the club’s statutes, the elec­tions, ini­tially set for March, must now be held within the next three months as the post is va­cant.</p>
    <p>In­terim pres­i­dent Car­les Tus­quets also re­vealed that the Span­ish club in­tend to hold salary talks with the players, point­ing out that the club’s fi­nan­cial sit­u­a­tion in the wake of Bar­tomeu’s de­par­ture was “highly wor­ry­ing”.</p>
    <p>Even though the squad took a 70 per cent pay cut dur­ing Spain’s na­tional emer­gency from March to June, Barca still face a re­ported €300 mil­lion (S$478 mil­lion) deficit be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We want to con­tinue to re­duce spend­ing in the short term and the most nec­es­sary mea­sure is salary rene­go­ti­a­tions,” Tus­quets said.</p>
    <p>“We hope to reach an agree­ment with the players and non-play­ing staff.”</p>
    <p>Sing­tel Ch111, to­mor­row, 3.55am</p>
