    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysia’s for­mer prime min­is­ter, Tun Dr Mahathir Mo­hamad, said the gov­ern­ment must i gnore advice about the bud­get given by a “con­victed crim­i­nal” in Par­lia­ment who has been found guilty of cor­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to MP Na­jib Razak, an­other for­mer premier, Dr Mahathir told an on­line news site that Par­lia­ment has tainted it­self by al­low­ing Na­jib to speak.</p>
    <p>“Any­where in the world, we can­not find a con­victed crim­i­nal who comes to the House and ad­vises the gov­ern­ment. This is amaz­ing,” Dr Mahathir told The Malaysian In­sight news site yes­ter­day. “Only in Malaysia, we can be proud that pris­on­ers are the gov­ern­ment’s ad­vis­ers. This goes to show this gov­ern­ment is so in­ef­fi­cient that con­victs can rep­ri­mand (the gov­ern­ment). This act has tainted the House.”</p>
    <p>This fol­lowed Dr Mahathir’s re­marks in Par­lia­ment on Thurs­day, when he asked why the “con­vict” Na­jib post­poned his on­go­ing cor­rup­tion trial on other charges linked to state fund 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had (1MDB), but had the time to speak in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>“It is very strange that his tri­als have stopped but the con­vict can be present in Par­lia­ment to de­liver his speech,” Free Malaysia To­day on­line news ser­vice quoted Dr Mahathir as say­ing dur­ing the de­bate on the bud­get.</p>
    <p>Na­jib was in July sen­tenced to 12 years’ jail and fined RM210 mil­lion (S$68.6 mil­lion) af­ter be­ing found guilty of all seven charges in the first of his five tri­als re­lat­ing to the 1MDB scan­dal. He is ap­peal­ing against the sen­tence. His other court cases linked to 1MDB have been post­poned by the court.</p>
    <p>Na­jib, who is still an MP, was re­cently ap­pointed chair­man of the Barisan Na­sional Back­benchers’ Club (BNBBC), which has 42 MPs. He spoke in Par­lia­ment for more than an hour on Tues­day as the BNBBC’s head, telling the gov­ern­ment that his fac­tion will not sup­port the bud­get for next year un­less its pro­pos­als are met.</p>
    <p>Last week, the Malaysian gov­ern­ment, which is backed by Na­jib’s party Umno, re­vealed that 1MDB still had an es­ti­mated RM32.3 bil­lion in out­stand­ing debt as of Septem­ber.</p>
