    <p>On Christ­mas Day in 1989, a con­cert at Ber­lin’s Konz­erthaus fea­tured a per­for­mance of Beethoven’s Ninth Sym­phony, known as his Cho­ral Sym­phony, led by leg­endary Amer­i­can con­duc­tor Leonard Bern­stein.</p>
    <p>The orches­tra and singers com­prised an in­ter­na­tional le­gion of mu­si­cians from Ger­many, the United King­dom, France, the Soviet Union and the United States. The cel­e­bra­tory oc­ca­sion marked the fall of the Ber­lin Wall the month be­fore.</p>
    <p>A sim­i­lar as­sem­blage of per­form­ers, now more than a thou­sand strong from around the world, reprised the sym­phony’s fi­nal move­ment, Ode To Joy, on In­ter­na­tional Friend­ship Day last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Con­duct­ing the In­ter­net-united en­sem­ble was Sin­ga­pore’s Wong Kah Chun (or Kahchun Wong, as he is known in­ter­na­tion­ally), win­ner of the Gus­tav Mahler In­ter­na­tional Con­duct­ing Com­pe­ti­tion and chief con­duc­tor of the Nurem­berg Sym­phony Orches­tra.</p>
    <p>In what is pos­si­bly mankind’s dark­est hour of the new mil­len­nium, be­sieged by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, Wong’s “univer­sal mu­si­cal kam­pung” de­liv­ered a heart­warm­ing mes­sage.</p>
    <p>Alle Men­schen Wer­den Bruder, or All Peo­ple Be­come Broth­ers, was Friedrich Schiller’s clar­ion call of 1785, which be­came Beethoven’s per­sonal credo in his fi­nal sym­phony of 1824.</p>
    <p>All 25 minutes or so of the Ode were per­formed. Even for those with lim­ited at­ten­tion spans, it seemed a breeze.</p>
    <p>The vir­tual con­cert hall, with a 360-de­gree view of all the per­form­ers in so­cially dis­tanced screens with Wong lead­ing at its cen­tre, was a marvel of mod­ern in­no­va­tion and tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>The open­ing out­burst and low string decla­ma­tions sug­gested a world in pri­mor­dial chaos, and the vis­ual was that of Wong con­duct­ing from within a fiery sea of lava and ris­ing steam.</p>
    <p>With each mea­sure of Beethoven’s iconic melody, each player was in­tro­duced in a puff of smoke un­til a re­volv­ing wall of hu­man­ity sur­rounded the mae­stro. Dis­or­der had given way to a sem­blance of form.</p>
    <p>Then it was bass-bari­tone Ni­cholas Brown­lee’s dec­la­ra­tion of O Fre­unde (O Friends), a com­ing to­gether of peo­ples lead­ing into the green­ery of Beethoven Im Garten, Wong and the Sin­ga­pore Ger­man Em­bassy’s shared vi­sion of bring­ing the com­poser’s mu­sic to the masses.</p>
    <p>A ce­les­tial band of an­gel-winged play­ers – pro­vid­ing un­usu­ally comic mo­ments – ac­com­pa­nied tenor Ger­ard Sch­nei­der for the Turk­ish march episode be­fore the tutti cho­rus’ glo­ri­ous state­ment of the big tune.</p>
    <p>With hun­dreds of faces, pos­si­bly a thou­sand, ap­pear­ing on screen for the first time, this was the prover­bial “lump in the throat” mo­ment, send­ing fris­sons down the spine.</p>
    <p>The cho­ral fugue was ac­com­pa­nied by four staves in Ger­man with English translit­er­a­tions, each cor­re­spond­ing to a SATB (so­prano alto tenor bass) voice part, a nifty con­cept that hinted of karaoke in­spi­ra­tions at play.</p>
    <p>The en­sem­ble was then trans­ported into a smart pen­cil­drawn 3D rep­re­sen­ta­tion of the Es­planade Con­cert Hall be­fore clos­ing with a coda in the clouds, where all play­ers were united for the fi­nal time.</p>
    <p>With ex­cel­lent recorded sound as well as crys­tal-clear vi­su­als, Beethoven 360° was a truly mem­o­rable, im­mer­sive ex­pe­ri­ence to be savoured over and over.</p>
