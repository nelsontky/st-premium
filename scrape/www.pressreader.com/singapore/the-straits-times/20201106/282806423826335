    <p>SEOUL • South Korean singer Jung Soo-jung, more widely known as Krys­tal of K-pop girl band f(x), is mov­ing from singing to an act­ing ca­reer.</p>
    <p>She plays a preg­nant univer­sity stu­dent, Toe-il, i n her de­but fea­ture More Than Fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“At first, I was hes­i­tant to play this role. But af­ter read­ing the script, I said I will take the role,” Jung, 26, said dur­ing a press con­fer­ence in Seoul on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“Toe-il is con­fi­dent and she be­lieves in her­self. I think she is rep­re­sen­ta­tive of women today. She is re­lat­able and also at­trac­tive.</p>
    <p>“We shot the film in sum­mer, so it was not easy for me to wear a fake preg­nant belly. But be­sides that, I had so much fun,” she added.</p>
    <p>In the movie, Toe-il finds out she is preg­nant and the fa­ther of the baby is Ho-hoon (Shin Jae-hwi), a younger stu­dent she has been tu­tor­ing.</p>
    <p>She plans to marry him and, while pre­par­ing for the wed­ding, she de­cides to look for her bi­o­log­i­cal fa­ther, who aban­doned her and her mother many years ago. But she can­not re­mem­ber much about him..</p>
    <p>Choi Ha-na, di­rec­tor of the up­com­ing com­edy film, said of Jung: “I thought she would do a great job play­ing Toe-il af­ter I saw her play­ing her role in the MBC sit­com High Kick 3.</p>
    <p>“But I did have some doubts as I also had a strong im­pres­sion of her on­stage as a K-pop girl band mem­ber, Krys­tal.</p>
    <p>“But af­ter our first meet­ing with her, I was sure she could play Toe-il.”</p>
    <p>Jung said: “I am both Krys­tal and Jung Soo-jung. I like both jobs – this time I tried hard to show a great per­for­mance as an ac­tress.”</p>
    <p>More Than Fam­ily is a de­but fea­ture for its di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>Choi, 28, said she wanted to write a story about fam­i­lies to change some of the prej­u­dices that ex­ist in South Korean so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>“Some peo­ple still tend to think that fam­i­lies with di­vorced par­ents are losers. But I want peo­ple to view those fam­i­lies as ones with hap­pier peo­ple,” the di­rec­tor said. “They ac­knowl­edged that there is some­thing wrong with their re­la­tion­ship and de­cided to do some­thing about it.”</p>
    <p>Small de­tails speak vol­umes about the char­ac­ters and the fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“In a con­ven­tional Korean fam­ily, it is not easy for par­ents to wel­come Toe-il’s de­ci­sion to have and raise a child at a young age,” Choi said.</p>
    <p>“Through the bright-coloured clothes of Ho-hoon’s fa­ther and mother, the back­ground mu­sic and their home dec­o­ra­tion, I tried to show that they wel­come Toe-il’s de­ci­sion and are dif­fer­ent from typ­i­cal Korean fam­i­lies.”</p>
    <p>The film opens in cin­e­mas in South Korea next Thurs­day.</p>
