    <p>THE SWORDS­MAN</p>
    <p>You can­not be blamed if you lose track of who’s who in this South Korean mar­tial arts flick that packs in as much his­tor­i­cal tex­ture as it does ac­tion.</p>
    <p>In its com­pact 101-minute run­ning time, a head-spin­ning ar­ray of sup­port­ing char­ac­ters are in­tro­duced, in­clud­ing vil­lage heal­ers, innkeep­ers, feu­dal lords and their fam­i­lies. That is wo­ven into a time-jump­ing, flash­back­driven plot that takes in Qing-ver­sus-Ming dy­nas­tic strug­gles in China and its knock-on ef­fects on Korea.</p>
    <p>Keep­ing it all straight – or at least, mak­ing an at­tempt to do so – is Choi Jae-hoon, who makes his de­but as a direc­tor of a fea­ture film (though he might have a direc­tor credit for a pre­vi­ous un­re­leased pic­ture, ac­cord­ing to hancin­ema.net, a web­site which tracks Korean films).</p>
    <p>That this movie was over­seen by its own writer might ex­plain the undis­ci­plined plot, but that mis­take can be for­given be­cause the end re­sult is a fun, sin­cere ode to sword flicks of Asian cin­ema, in par­tic­u­lar Ja­panese movies about wan­der­ing samurai (of­ten with a dis­abil­ity which never seems to di­min­ish their abil­ity to fight) or lone war­riors shield­ing a child from im­pe­rial mal­ice.</p>
    <p>The film opens with a flash­back to a show­down at the royal palace in­volv­ing the tac­i­turn war­rior Tae-yul (screen heart-throb Jang Hyuk). Its out­come forces him out of aris­to­cratic cir­cles and into a vil­lage where he lives in ob­scu­rity with his daugh­ter Tae-ok (Kim Hyeon-soo), whom he keeps in the dark about his ori­gins.</p>
    <p>The lov­ing child does what she can to slow down her fa­ther’s en­croach­ing blind­ness. En­ter Ku­ru­tai (In­done­sian ac­tor Joe Taslim), a Manchu from China. Like a boss’ son who lords over em­ploy­ees, the bully is re­lated to the pow­er­ful Qing dy­nasty and makes a liv­ing en­slav­ing Kore­ans.</p>
    <p>Ku­ru­tai is cruel, but that does not mean he is a brute. Like a jaded gun­slinger from the Old West, he is tired of fight­ing boys who think they have stud­ied the blade and wants to test him­self against a real mas­ter.</p>
    <p>As the movie winds its way to the in­evitable bat­tle be­tween the Manchu and the man from nowhere, Tae-yul keeps his steel slick with the blood of lesser hench­men. The du­els are more el­e­gant than bru­tal and nowhere as gory as, say, the Marvel su­per­hero movie Lo­gan (2017), which fea­tures the head-lop­ping Wolver­ine played by Hugh Jack­man.</p>
    <p>Stand­ing in con­trast to the re­al­ism in sword stunts and po­lit­i­cal in­trigue is the cringe-in­duc­ing ado­les­cent wack­i­ness go­ing on in the Manchu camp. Pic­ture 1960s James Bond sex kit­tens, Ja­panese nin­jas and vil­lains sprawled on crushed vel­vet cush­ions. The cheesi­ness, how­ever, adds to the film’s charm.</p>
    <p>COF­FEE OR TEA?</p>
    <p>This Chi­nese com­edy is billed as the fol­low-up to the suc­cess­ful Amer­i­can Dreams In China (2013) be­cause its direc­tor Peter Chan is back, but as the pro­ducer. Derek Hui, a rel­a­tive new­comer to fea­ture films, di­rects.</p>
    <p>Struc­turally, the new movie re­sem­bles the older one: Three young men forge a friend­ship based on shared busi­ness goals, only to have the bonds tested by re­al­ity. The first movie was set in the 1980s, when Chi­nese stu­dents in ma­jor cities like Bei­jing were gripped by the craze for a Western ed­u­ca­tion, par­tic­u­larly in the United States.</p>
    <p>Cof­fee Or Tea? re­verses the mo­ti­va­tions by tap­ping the ro­man­tic ideals that city folk in China to­day hold about ru­ral life in their coun­try. It is a yearn­ing ex­pressed in the videos of former city dweller-turned-rustic-god­dess Li Ziqi, who has gained mil­lions of fol­low­ers on YouTube and Chi­nese so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Ac­tors Liu Hao­ran, Peng Yuchang and Yin Fang play three men whose fates be­come entwined in the hills of Yun­nan Prov­ince, where life’s clock runs slowly and tea is revered, both as a bev­er­age and the area’s sole source of income.</p>
    <p>When the lads drag their vil­lage into the 21st cen­tury by in­tro­duc­ing on­line shop­ping and cof­fee, chaos en­sues, along with some learn­ing and laugh­ter.</p>
    <p>As with other Chi­nese films re­leased dur­ing China’s Oct 1 Na­tional Day cel­e­bra­tions, there is some self-con­grat­u­la­tion here over how the gov­ern­ment has helped make farm­ing an at­trac­tive enough vo­ca­tion so young peo­ple choose to stay in­stead of mi­grat­ing to the city.</p>
    <p>That might be so, but the story makes the un­for­tu­nate cre­ative choice of view­ing Yun­nanese farmers mostly as prob­lems in search of a so­lu­tion. Ru­ral folk are in­fan­tilised, be­com­ing ei­ther mag­i­cal elfin crea­tures or sad bump­kins.</p>
    <p>It is an un­fair, lazy por­trayal that sits awk­wardly atop a story that is other­wise a de­cent rags-to-riches tale that touches on the pang of yearn­ing ur­ban folks feel when watching a video of a wo­man ir­ri­gat­ing a cu­cum­ber patch, us­ing wa­ter from a wooden bucket car­ried on her shoul­ders.</p>
    <p>THE SONG OF NAMES</p>
    <p>An­other film that is out this week but not re­viewed is The Song Of Names, a drama star­ring Tim Roth and Clive Owen. The two char­ac­ters first meet as chil­dren dur­ing World War II, when Dovidl, a refugee and vi­o­lin prodigy, is adopted into Martin’s fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Later, as a young man, Dovidl van­ishes be­fore a per­for­mance, trau­ma­tis­ing his fam­ily. Years later, as an adult, Martin (Roth) finds a clue that might lead him to Dovidl.</p>
