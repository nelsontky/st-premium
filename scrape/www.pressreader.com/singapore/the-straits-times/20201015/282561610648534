    <p>• Aus­tralian ac­tress Ni­cole Kid­man stars op­po­site Hugh Grant for the first time in the new HBO se­ries The Un­do­ing, where they play a mar­ried couple whose priv­i­leged lives risk be­ing un­done by their se­crets.</p>
    <p>But if Kid­man had got­ten her way, she would have acted with the English ac­tor much ear­lier in the 1999 movie Not­ting Hill .</p>
    <p>Kid­man, 52, said she “re­ally wanted the role that Ju­lia Roberts played in Not­ting Hill”, in a re­cent Zoom in­ter­view for Marie Claire magazine along with Grant, 60.</p>
    <p>“But I wasn’t well known enough, and I wasn’t tal­ented enough,” said Kid­man, who is known for movies such as Eyes Wide Shut (1999), Moulin Rouge! (2001) and The Hours (2002), which won her a Best Ac­tress Os­car.</p>
    <p>In Not­ting Hill, Grant plays a Lon­don book seller and Roberts an ac­tress who falls for Grant’s char­ac­ter. They were nom­i­nated for Best Ac­tor and Best Ac­tress re­spec­tively at the Golden Globe Awards in 2000, and the ro­man­tic com­edy was one of the high­est-gross­ing Bri­tish movies of all time.</p>
    <p>Kid­man said in the in­ter­view that she was also hop­ing for a role in the movie Love Ac­tu­ally (2003), which fea­tured an en­sem­ble cast i nclud­ing Grant and Emma Thomp­son.</p>
    <p>She said “maybe I was gonna do a small role in Love Ac­tu­ally at one point”.</p>
    <p>“Which part?” asked Grant. “I can’t re­mem­ber. It was not a big role,” said Kid­man.</p>
    <p>Kid­man and Grant also men­tioned they first crossed paths in their 20s at a din­ner in Lon­don, when Kid­man was mar­ried to ac­tor</p>
    <p>Tom Cruise, while Grant was mar­ried to ac­tress El­iz­a­beth Hur­ley.</p>
    <p>Kid­man is now mar­ried to Aus­tralian singer Keith Ur­ban, while Grant is mar­ried to Swedish film pro­ducer Anna Eber­stein.</p>
    <p>Co­in­ci­den­tally, both Kid­man and Grant played the an­tag­o­nists in the live-ac­tion Padding­ton movies, though she was in the first movie (2014), while he was in the 2017 se­quel.</p>
