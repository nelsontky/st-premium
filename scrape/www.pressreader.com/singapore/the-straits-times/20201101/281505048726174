    <p>The world saw more grim milestones in the Covid-19 pan­demic as more than 10 mil­lion cases were re­ported in Europe since it first hit the con­ti­nent at the be­gin­ning of the year, while the United States re­ported an­other record num­ber of new in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Europe, with 52 coun­tries, is now the third most af­fected re­gion in the world af­ter Latin Amer­ica and the Caribbean with 11.2 mil­lion cases, ac­cord­ing to a Fri­day tally by Agence France-Presse based on health author­ity fig­ures.</p>
    <p>Asia has 10.5 mil­lion cases. Europe is record­ing 241,000 new cases a day – com­pared with 15,000 at the start of July – and rep­re­sented roughly half of the pre­vi­ous week’s global in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Some 14 Euro­pean coun­tries mean­while reg­is­tered a record num­ber of hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions linked to the virus last week.</p>
    <p>Italy posted its own daily in­fec­tion record on Fri­day, fu­elling de­bate about whether it should fol­low France into a na­tional lock­down. “Over 31,000 cases and 199 deaths. I ask you one ques­tion: what are you wait­ing for?” vi­rol­o­gist Roberto Bu­ri­oni tweeted.</p>
    <p>Bel­gium, which has the most Covid-19 cases per capita in the world, said it would im­pose tighter lock­down rules from to­mor­row, clos­ing non-es­sen­tial busi­nesses and re­strict­ing house­hold vis­its.</p>
    <p>France’s 65 mil­lion peo­ple woke up on Fri­day to a new lock­down, largely con­fined to their homes and need­ing writ­ten state­ments to leave. But some medics voiced fears that steady traf­fic and ap­pre­cia­ble num­bers of peo­ple on pub­lic trans­port in Paris showed peo­ple were not tak­ing the lock­down as se­ri­ously a sec­ond time round.</p>
    <p>“We don’t have the choice, we are obliged to live, do our shop­ping and be­have as if it is nor­mal even if there are some safety mea­sures,” said 18-year-old Fabrice An­gelique, who was buy­ing head­phones at a store sell­ing books and elec­tron­ics in Paris.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 49,215 new cases were recorded over 24 hours in France, ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cial fig­ures on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>In the Czech Repub­lic, law­mak­ers voted to ex­tend a state of emer­gency un­til Nov 20, while Ice­land or­dered bars and night­clubs to close and limited pub­lic gath­er­ings to no more than 10 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>But there has been re­sis­tance to mea­sures to stop the virus, with clashes be­tween protesters and po­lice erupt­ing on Fri­day in the Span­ish city of Barcelona against new re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>And thou­sands of peo­ple ral­lied in War­saw and across Poland, de­fy­ing gov­ern­ment or­ders and risk­ing coro­n­avirus con­ta­gion to voice their anger at a court rul­ing ban­ning al­most all abor­tions.</p>
    <p>In Rus­sia, Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin said he had no plans to in­tro­duce a sweep­ing lock­down, even as the coun­try saw record tolls with re­ports of am­bu­lance queues at hos­pi­tals and med­i­cal short­ages.</p>
    <p>The virus also con­tin­ued its march through Latin Amer­ica and the Caribbean, with the re­gion pass­ing 400,000 deaths on Fri­day, ac­cord­ing to an AFP tally.</p>
    <p>In North Amer­ica, the US set a new all-time high for coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed in a sin­gle 24-hour pe­riod on Fri­day, re­port­ing just over 100,000 new in­fec­tions to sur­pass the record to­tal of 91,000 posted a day ear­lier, a Reuters tally showed.</p>
    <p>The spike comes just four days ahead of the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>For Sin­ga­porean stu­dents who had re­turned to their uni­ver­si­ties in Europe and the US be­tween Au­gust and last month when the pan­demic ap­peared to be sta­bil­is­ing, the resur­gence of the virus is dis­con­cert­ing.</p>
    <p>The Sun­day Times spoke to stu­dents in Bri­tain, France, Ger­many, the Nether­lands and the US in the past week.</p>
    <p>They said they are wor­ried, have taken pre­cau­tions but are un­able to pre­dict how bad the sit­u­a­tion will be.</p>
    <p>It is turn­ing out to be a win­ter of dis­con­tent for thou­sands of Sin­ga­porean stu­dents who re­turned to cam­puses in Europe and the United States be­tween Au­gust and last month.</p>
    <p>That was when the pan­demic had looked to be sta­bil­is­ing. But there has been a rapid resur­gence of the coro­n­avirus across Europe and the US since.</p>
    <p>This comes as the cold sea­son ap­proaches, with ex­perts warn­ing of a spike in cases dur­ing win­ter.</p>
    <p>The stu­dents’ ex­pec­ta­tions of a full uni­ver­sity life have been un­der­mined by height­ened ten­sions be­tween them and house­mates who are blase about the dis­ease’s risks, choose to party and ig­nore rec­om­men­da­tions such as mask us­age.</p>
    <p>The govern­ments in Europe and the US are also strug­gling to put in place safe­guards, even as they deal with po­lit­i­cal blow­back from a pop­u­lace tired of re­stric­tive mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The Sun­day Times spoke to stu­dents in Bri­tain, France, Ger­many, the Nether­lands and the US in the past week. They said they are wor­ried, have taken pre­cau­tions but are un­able to pre­dict how bad the sit­u­a­tion will be. With their par­ents in Sin­ga­pore, they have to make their own de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>“I’m ac­tu­ally very scared to use all my hos­tel ameni­ties,” said Ms Claire Zhou, 23, a stu­dent at the Uni­ver­sity of Ox­ford in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>“I only stay in my room and I re­frain from cook­ing.”</p>
    <p>Mr Xu Jiaxin, 22, in his sec­ond year at the Men­ton cam­pus of France’s Sci­ences Po Paris uni­ver­sity, said: “Even if you stick to small and re­spon­si­ble so­cial cir­cles, you can’t con­trol what other peo­ple are go­ing to do.”</p>
    <p>For in­stance, one stu­dent in Europe said her house­mate has been play­ing rugby de­spite hav­ing been iden­ti­fied as a close con­tact of a con­firmed Covid-19 case.</p>
    <p>Europe went from six mil­lion cases to seven mil­lion in just 10 days last month, ac­cord­ing to the United Na­tions. In the US, cases sur­passed nine mil­lion on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>It is lock­down time again in France and Ger­many, while the US is brac­ing it­self for an un­pre­dictable pres­i­den­tial elec­tion on Tues­day that could see peo­ple who are not sat­is­fied with the re­sults take to the streets, in vi­o­la­tion of coro­n­avirus rules.</p>
    <p>Mr Kwan Jin Yao, 29, a fi­nal-year PhD stu­dent at the Uni­ver­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, Los An­ge­les, said there is also Thanks­giv­ing on Nov 26, the big­gest fam­ily hol­i­day in the US.“It will be a su­per-spreader event, with peo­ple fly­ing all over the States. It will get worse be­fore it gets bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs had ear­lier in the year ad­vised all over­seas stu­dents to re­turn to Sin­ga­pore, in view of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Some of those on gov­ern­ment schol­ar­ships have been for­bid­den from fly­ing back to school, and have stayed in Sin­ga­pore to do re­mote learn­ing in­stead.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents who pre­fer the full ex­pe­ri­ence are among those who flew back be­tween Au­gust and last month when school terms be­gan.</p>
    <p>Mr Shaun Ang, 21, a Lon­don School of Eco­nomics (LSE) stu­dent in his first year, did so in Septem­ber to “max­imise my ex­pe­ri­ence” in that city.</p>
    <p>He added: “I am pay­ing uni­ver­sity fees and did not want to just be do­ing on­line classes.</p>
    <p>“Back then, the sit­u­a­tion was im­prov­ing so I also didn’t ex­pect the cases to spike.”</p>
    <p>Mas­ter’s stu­dent at Delft Uni­ver­sity of Tech­nol­ogy in the Nether­lands Liaw Su Xin, 25, is back on cam­pus as her course in land­scape ar­chi­tec­ture re­quires her to be on site for some ac­tiv­i­ties, with oth­ers held on­line.</p>
    <p>She said: “The pan­demic is def­i­nitely af­fect­ing my ed­u­ca­tion ex­pe­ri­ence. On­line dis­cus­sions al­ways have some mis­com­mu­ni­ca­tion and a lack of con­nec­tion and spon­ta­neous in­ter­ac­tion.”</p>
    <p>Stu­dents have had to adapt to cum­ber­some com­mu­ni­ca­tion and more in Europe un­der the cloud of the virus.</p>
    <p>They said their Euro­pean coun­ter­parts have taken less to the rules, and that some con­tin­ued to book clubs for par­ties, where there is risk as so­cial dis­tanc­ing is of­ten not ob­served.</p>
    <p>Mr Ang said it is still mostly Asian stu­dents who con­sis­tently wear masks.</p>
    <p>Ms Kelly Yeo, a 20-year-old stu­dent at the Philipps Univer­si­tat Mar­burg in Ger­many, es­ti­mates that only one in five peo­ple wears a mask when they go out.</p>
    <p>Many Euro­pean coun­tries stip­u­late mask-wear­ing only in in­door ar­eas like su­per­mar­kets.</p>
    <p>The rules are in any case dif­fi­cult to en­force, the stu­dents said.</p>
    <p>“It’s very hard to reg­u­late be­cause of the size of Bri­tain and there aren’t any so­cial dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors around,” said Mr Ethan Cheng, 22, of Uni­ver­sity Col­lege Lon­don.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents are mak­ing the ad­just­ments and gear­ing them­selves for a harsh, long win­ter.</p>
    <p>Ms El­iz­a­beth Tong,</p>
    <p>SELF-PRO­TEC­TION</p>
    <p>I’m ac­tu­ally very scared to use all my hos­tel ameni­ties. I only stay in my room and I re­frain from cook­ing.</p>
    <p>MS CLAIRE ZHOU, a stu­dent at the Uni­ver­sity of Ox­ford in Bri­tain, on lim­it­ing con­tact with other stu­dents.</p>
    <p>NO SAFETY GUAR­AN­TEE</p>
    <p>Even if you stick to small and re­spon­si­ble so­cial cir­cles, you can’t con­trol what other peo­ple are go­ing to do.</p>
    <p>MR XU JIAXIN, a sec­ond-year un­der­grad­u­ate at the Sci­ences Po Paris uni­ver­sity in Men­ton, France, on the need for every­one to abide by the rules.</p>
    <p>22, a stu­dent at Heidelberg Uni­ver­sity in Ger­many, said re­turn­ing to Sin­ga­pore is not a vi­able op­tion, cit­ing quar­an­tine costs as a fac­tor.</p>
    <p>She is op­ti­mistic about stay­ing on though, not­ing Ger­many’s re­newed ef­forts to tackle the virus.</p>
    <p>“A dif­fi­cult and gloomy win­ter stands be­fore us, but I feel that if we ad­here to the newly im­posed re­stric­tions du­ti­fully, we will be able to” see virus cases go down, she said.</p>

As pan&#xAD;demic cases surge across Europe, France and Ger&#xAD;many have gone into lock&#xAD;down mode again.</p>
