    <p>A to­tal of 342 mi­grant work­ers will serve a 14-day quar­an­tine af­ter a Covid-19 pa­tient was de­tected in the Tuas dor­mi­tory they were stay­ing in. The work­ers were moved from the Space@Tuas dorm to a govern­ment quar­an­tine fa­cil­ity af­ter the con­firmed Covid-19 case was de­tected on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power said yes­ter­day the new case was dis­cov­ered dur­ing ros­tered rou­tine test­ing.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 342 mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in a Tuas dor­mi­tory will serve a 14-day quar­an­tine af­ter a Covid-19 case was de­tected in their block.</p>
    <p>All of them were moved from the Space@Tuas dorm to a govern­ment quar­an­tine fa­cil­ity af­ter the con­firmed Covid-19 case was de­tected on Mon­day, the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said that the new case was dis­cov­ered through its ros­tered rou­tine test­ing.</p>
    <p>As a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure, a stay-home no­tice was is­sued to all work­ers stay­ing in two dor­mi­tory blocks in Space@Tuas.</p>
    <p>MOM said that this pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure was taken af­ter its pre­lim­i­nary as­sess­ment found that phys­i­cal seg­re­ga­tion mea­sures meant to keep work­ers across the two blocks from in­ter­mix­ing ap­peared to have been breached.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther in­ves­ti­ga­tions, how­ever, es­tab­lished that it was un­likely work­ers from dif­fer­ent blocks had in­ter­mixed.</p>
    <p>There­fore, the stay-home no­tices for the un­af­fected block were re­scinded.</p>
    <p>How­ever, as safe liv­ing mea­sures had not been strictly en­forced in the block that the con­firmed Covid-19 pa­tient stayed in, 342 res­i­dents there – who work for 27 em­ploy­ers – had to be quar­an­tined.</p>
    <p>On Aug 19, MOM had de­clared all dorms clear of Covid-19, in­clud­ing the stand­alone blocks in pur­pose­built dor­mi­to­ries that served as iso­la­tion or quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>How­ever, coro­n­avirus clus­ters con­tin­ued to emerge, with new dorm clus­ters an­nounced for three con­sec­u­tive days from Aug 22 to 24.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause many of the work­ers have not been ex­posed and there­fore re­main sus­cep­ti­ble to the virus, Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Man­power Tan See Leng ex­plained on Sept 9.</p>
    <p>MOM re­minded all dorm op­er­a­tors, em­ploy­ers and work­ers to work to­gether to com­ply with strict safe liv­ing mea­sures within dorms.</p>
    <p>Do­ing so would limit quar­an­tine mea­sures to af­fected work­ers stay­ing on the same level or sec­tion, in­stead of all dorm res­i­dents in the en­tire block, the min­istry added.</p>
    <p>“It is only with the col­lec­tive ef­forts of all par­ties that our mi­grant work­ers can re­main safe and healthy and our busi­nesses face min­i­mal dis­rup­tions to their op­er­a­tions,” the min­istry said.</p>
