    <p>At the Na­tional Mu­seum’s lat­est ex­hi­bi­tion, vis­i­tors can re­live the sights, sounds and even smells of Sin­ga­pore from the 1950s to to­day through pho­tos, arte­facts, au­dio-vis­ual footage and spe­cial dig­i­tal fea­tures. Called Home, Truly: Grow­ing Up With Sin­ga­pore, 1950s To The Present, the free ex­hi­bi­tion opened on Dec 19 and runs till Aug 29.</p>
    <p>At the Na­tional Mu­seum’s lat­est ex­hi­bi­tion, vis­i­tors can re­live the sights, sounds and even smells of Sin­ga­pore from the 1950s to to­day through pho­tos, arte­facts, au­diovisual footage and spe­cial dig­i­tal fea­tures.</p>
    <p>Plonk your­self in an arm­chair and lis­ten to an au­dio record­ing of vet­eran ra­dio dee­jay Brian Richmond talk about the good old days when doors of homes were “al­ways open” for neigh­bours to weave in and out.</p>
    <p>Or step into the scents sta­tion, where the fa­mil­iar aroma of fish head curry wafts through the air.</p>
    <p>At another area, stand in silent re­mem­brance of the vic­tims of the SilkAir Flight MI 185 crash in Palem­bang, In­done­sia, on Dec 19, 1997. It claimed 104 lives, among them 46 Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>The free ex­hi­bi­tion, Home, Truly: Grow­ing Up With Sin­ga­pore, 1950s To The Present, opened on Dec 19 and runs till Aug 29.</p>
    <p>It is or­gan­ised in col­lab­o­ra­tion with The Straits Times to mark the news­pa­per’s 175th an­niver­sary, as well as with pho­tog­ra­phy mar­ket­place Pho­ton­ico and Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings.</p>
    <p>There are five main themes, with the clos­ing chap­ter ad­dress­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>On show are more than 200 pho­tos con­trib­uted by the Na­tional Mu­seum, Na­tional Archives, ST and the public, as well as about 80 arte­facts from the Na­tional Her­itage Board (NHB).</p>
    <p>The mu­seum con­ducted con­ver­sa­tions with more than 120 peo­ple, in­clud­ing mem­bers of the public, on what home means to them, and in­volved them in as­pects such as cu­ra­tion, con­cep­tu­al­is­ing the nar­ra­tive and photo se­lec­tion.</p>
    <p>One of the col­lab­o­ra­tors is As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Eu­gene Dairi­anathan from the Vis­ual and Per­form­ing Arts Aca­demic Group (Mu­sic) at the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Ed­u­ca­tion, who was ap­proached to co-cu­rate an in­ter­ac­tive mu­sic seg­ment called A Singing Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors can play 12 “dis­tinctly Sin­ga­pore” songs from a juke­box.</p>
    <p>“Songs (can give) a sense of au­then­tic­ity of place, space and time of lived ex­pe­ri­ences of home,” Prof Dairi­anathan says.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces of­fi­cer and pho­tog­ra­phy en­thu­si­ast Alex Chua was tasked to cap­ture be­hind-the-scenes sto­ries in for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries af­ter Covid-19 spread there last year.</p>
    <p>The 48-year-old was a team leader in the Min­istry of Man­power’s For­ward As­sur­ance and Sup­port Teams (Fast) de­ployed to the dorms in April.</p>
    <p>Four of his pho­tos – of health­care work­ers don­ning per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment (PPE) for hours</p>
    <p>Four of pho­tog­ra­phy en­thu­si­ast Alex Chua’s shots of health­care work­ers bat­tling Covid-19 are on show. while car­ing for the work­ers – are show­cased at the ex­hi­bi­tion.</p>
    <p>“They res­onate with me very much,” he says. “It is un­com­fort­able wear­ing the PPE and the front­lin­ers are al­ways drenched in sweat when they re­move it at the end of the day.”</p>
    <p>For in­stance, he cre­ated a com­pos­ite shot of Dr Stephanie Yap, a den­tist who was part of the mo­bile swab team – made up of im­ages of her with and with­out PPE on.</p>
    <p>“Her face and hair were drenched in sweat, and she had deep line marks on her face from her mask,” he says.</p>
    <p>Other slices of Sin­ga­pore his­tory are also cap­tured in im­ages by ST pho­tog­ra­phers.</p>
    <p>Ed­i­tor-in-chief War­ren Fer­nan­dez says the news­pa­per has been telling the story of Sin­ga­pore – from its days as a Bri­tish colony to In­de­pen­dence and be­yond.</p>
