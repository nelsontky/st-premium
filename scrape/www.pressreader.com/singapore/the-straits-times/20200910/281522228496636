    <p>At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Lu­cien Wong re­cused him­self from the re­view of the case of for­mer do­mes­tic worker Parti Liyani last Satur­day, a day af­ter the High Court ac­quit­ted her of theft, the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Deputy At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Hri Ku­mar Nair will lead the re­view of the case, the AGC said, adding that Mr Wong and his deputies were not in­volved in any pros­e­cu­to­rial de­ci­sions on the case.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan Seng Onn had, last Fri­day, ac­quit­ted Ms Parti, 46, of steal­ing from Changi Air­port Group chair­man Liew Mun Leong and his fam­ily. The judge also raised ques­tions about the Liews’ mo­ti­va­tion in lodg­ing a po­lice re­port against the maid, who they had il­le­gally de­ployed in son Karl’s home and of­fice.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the AGC noted that Mr Wong had sat on the board of Cap­i­ta­Land while Mr Liew was pres­i­dent and chief ex­ec­u­tive of the com­pany. But Mr Wong stepped down from the board in 2006, years be­fore be­ing ap­pointed at­tor­ney-gen­eral in 2017. Said the AGC: “A-G Lu­cien Wong and Mr Liew did not have a per­sonal re­la­tion­ship, and this con­tin­ues to­day.”</p>
