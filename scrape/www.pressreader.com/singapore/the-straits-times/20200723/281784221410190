    <p>TOKYO • Ja­pan’s push to help re­vive its virus-rav­aged econ­omy with a “Go To” travel cam­paign has dealt a dou­ble blow to Tokyo, whose res­i­dents were cut off from promised travel sub­si­dies and busi­nesses are set to miss out on tourists.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme, pro­mot­ing do­mes­tic travel by of­fer­ing dis­count vouch­ers to boost an ail­ing tourism in­dus­try, kicked off yesterday ahead of a four-day hol­i­day week­end.</p>
    <p>But Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe’s gov­ern­ment last week de­cided to re­move Tokyo res­i­dents after daily con­firmed coro­n­avirus cases reached records in the cap­i­tal and stoked wor­ries that the plan could spread the virus.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing staked its prospects for an economic re­cov­ery on do­mes­tic de­mand, Ja­pan, which has re­lied heav­ily on Chi­nese tourists in re­cent years, has gone fur­ther than most coun­tries by en­cour­ag­ing do­mes­tic travel after an al­most 100 per cent de­cline in for­eign vis­i­tors dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The resur­gence of cases in ma­jor ur­ban cen­tres, how­ever, high­lights the chal­lenges gov­ern­ments face as they try to balance re­build­ing their economies with a con­stantly evolv­ing health cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Tokyo res­i­dents, who pay the big­gest share of in­come taxes of any Ja­panese re­gion, are an­gry over not re­ceiv­ing travel sub­si­dies and have raised ques­tions about the le­gal­ity of their ex­clu­sion.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses say can­cel­la­tions have led to lost rev­enue and the gov­ern­ment re­sponse is mud­dled.</p>
    <p>Tokyo Gov­er­nor Yuriko Koike said on Tues­day she may urge res­i­dents to avoid un­nec­es­sary travel dur­ing the up­com­ing four-day week­end that was orig­i­nally sched­uled to cel­e­brate the start of the now-post­poned Tokyo Olympic Games.</p>
    <p>The to­tal con­firmed virus cases sur­passed 10,000 in Tokyo after around 230 in­fec­tions were found yesterday.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing pub­lic crit­i­cism, Trans­port Min­is­ter Kazuyoshi Ak­aba said the gov­ern­ment will pay for can­cel­la­tion fees for trips to and from Tokyo booked be­tween July 10 and 17.</p>
    <p>But the trou­bles with the pro­gramme have been viewed by many as an­other mis­step in Mr Abe’s man­age­ment of the virus, which many have seen as, at times, be­ing slow and hap­haz­ard.</p>
