    <p>Af­ter three months of work­ing with tour groups with a max­i­mum of 10 par­tic­i­pants, lo­cal tour op­er­a­tors were able to take groups of up to 20 from yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Tour op­er­a­tors said the in­crease in par­tic­i­pant cap has given them much-needed flex­i­bil­ity and al­lows them to save on some costs.</p>
    <p>So­ci­ety of Tourist Guides Sin­ga­pore chair­man Jean Wang said the change will give op­er­a­tors some flex­i­bil­ity in plan­ning, and make them more cost-ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>“In in­stances where clients wanted to add two or three more to a group of 10, we might have had to scram­ble to ac­ti­vate an­other guide to ac­com­mo­date them, but we do not have to worry about that now,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mr Ja­son Loe, founder of Tribe Tours, said the in­crease in group ca­pac­ity could make some of the com­pany’s tours slightly more prof­itable.</p>
    <p>“Prior to this, when tour sizes were re­stricted to 10, costs dou­bled for groups greater than that num­ber. That means more re­sources had to be de­ployed, like two guides or two ve­hi­cles to ac­com­mo­date the group,” he said.</p>
    <p>“More par­tic­i­pants per guide means we can earn more, and keep­ing groups to 12 will not com­pro­mise our ser­vice or safety con­sid­er­a­tions,” said Mr Sim Cher Huey, founder of eco ad­ven­ture travel com­pany Kayaka­sia.</p>
    <p>Mr Tony Tan, direc­tor and guide at Be­tel Box The Real Sin­ga­pore Tours, agreed, say­ing the in­crease in group sizes makes tours more scal­able.</p>
    <p>“When the group sizes are too small, the cost of op­er­a­tions can be quite high for us, and the shared costs for par­tic­i­pants, like guide fees, may also be pro­hib­i­tively high,” said Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>His com­pany has seen more than dou­ble the num­ber of book­ings for Novem­ber com­pared with Oc­to­ber, most of them cor­po­rate book­ings.</p>
    <p>Mr Suen Tat Yam, founder of Mon­ster Day Tours, said the group ca­pac­ity in­crease is un­likely to af­fect the sign-ups for public tours dra­mat­i­cally, but that the new max­i­mum of 20 suits en­ti­ties like com­pa­nies and schools best. Some of them had al­ready made in­quiries with the com­pany, he added.</p>
    <p>“Many of th­ese clients had book­ings with us prior to Covid-19, and we have ex­tended them for a per­pet­ual pe­riod,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Some see that things are set­tling down, and are com­fort­able with dis­cussing the re­sump­tion of tours again for their em­ploy­ees or stu­dents.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, some tour op­er­a­tors are in no rush to raise group sizes.</p>
    <p>Mr Toh Thiam Wei, founder of In­die Sin­ga­pore, said his com­pany’s guides have found smaller group sizes more in­ti­mate and in­ter­ac­tive, es­pe­cially when com­pared with those of up to 40 that they led be­fore Covid-19 struck.</p>
    <p>The com­pany wants to see if it can main­tain smaller group sizes even be­yond the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers like Mr Sim said that he would keep the group ca­pac­ity to about 10 due to the un­cer­tainty of the pan­demic, and in case group sizes were de­creased again if the sit­u­a­tion got worse.</p>
    <p>Those run­ning food tours also cited the “group of five” rule at dine-in es­tab­lish­ments as a hin­drance to in­creas­ing group sizes.</p>
