    <p>Mr Gi­bran Rak­abum­ing Raka, the son of In­done­sian Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo, ap­peared set to em­u­late his fa­ther and be­come the mayor of Solo city in Cen­tral Java, af­ter un­of­fi­cial tal­lies showed he had won more than 85 per cent of the votes in the re­gional elec­tions yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old, who ran with Mr Teguh Prakosa as his deputy, was lead­ing against his chal­lenger, lit­tle-known tai­lor Bagyo Wahy­ono and his deputy FX Su­pardjo, ac­cord­ing to early “quick counts” by two poll­sters, or un­of­fi­cial tal­lies of a sam­ple of votes.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cial re­sults will be known be­tween next Wed­nes­day and Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Gi­bran told a press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day that his pri­or­i­ties would be to tackle the health and eco­nomic chal­lenges brought about by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He said: “I’ve re­peated many times about the need to ac­cel­er­ate the eco­nomic re­cov­ery in Solo. We will not only reach out to young peo­ple but also ev­ery Solo res­i­dent.”</p>
    <p>More than 700 pairs of can­di­dates for var­i­ous lo­cal of­fices con­tested in the sin­gle-day polls, known as the “pilkada” in Ba­hasa In­done­sia, af­ter a three-month de­lay due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Il­ham Sa­pu­tra, com­mis­sioner with the Gen­eral Elec­tion Com­mis­sion or KPU, told The Straits Times that the elec­tions went smoothly with “no re­ports of sig­nif­i­cant hin­drance in the elec­tion process”.</p>
    <p>One of the big­gest con­cerns about hold­ing the elec­tion dur­ing a pan­demic is the po­ten­tial un­con­trolled spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>This democ­racy of 270 mil­lion peo­ple has recorded nearly 600,000 con­firmed cases and more than 18,000 fa­tal­i­ties – South-east Asia’s high­est on both counts.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, Pres­i­dent Joko wrote: “(The) Dec 9 elec­tions had posed a unique chal­lenge as they had taken place dur­ing a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Be­sides hav­ing to im­ple­ment the (elec­tions) demo­crat­i­cally, there’s one thing that must not be ig­nored. Health pro­to­cols must be ad­hered to for the sake of our safety and se­cu­rity.”</p>
    <p>Wear­ing masks and gloves, mil­lions of vot­ers across the coun­try turned out to cast their bal­lots for nine gov­er­nors, 224 re­gents and 37 may­ors – col­lec­tively known as re­gional heads.</p>
    <p>Mr J usuf Melan, a voter i n Medan, said: “I was wor­ried ini­tially but it’s a shame to miss an im­por­tant event that takes place only once in ev­ery five years.”</p>
    <p>But not ev­ery­one was will­ing to take the risk.</p>
    <p>Mr Se­man, a polling of­fi­cer in Medan, said only 190 of 430 el­i­gi­ble vot­ers showed up to cast their bal­lots at his polling sta­tion.</p>
    <p>“This elec­tion has been very quiet. Peo­ple were wor­ried about con­tract­ing the virus so many have stayed at home rather than come out to vote,” he added.</p>
    <p>A huge lo­gis­ti­cal un­der­tak­ing, the elec­tions in­volved more than two mil­lion work­ers who were de­ployed to nearly 300,000 polling sta­tions across the ar­chi­pel­ago.</p>
    <p>Epi­demi­ol­o­gists warned that the elec­tion may trig­ger new clus­ters of in­fec­tion but the KPU as­sured cit­i­zens it had taken nec­es­sary health pre­cau­tions to curb the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>Mr Se­man said he and his col­leagues en­sured vot­ers main­tained a safe dis­tance, washed their hands and wore gloves be­fore they were al­lowed to en­ter the polling sta­tions.</p>
    <p>Vot­ers were also sprayed with dis­in­fec­tant and had their tem­per­a­tures taken.</p>
    <p>Like in pre­vi­ous elec­tions, pub­lic at­ten­tion has been fo­cused on can­di­dates with links to po­lit­i­cal fam­i­lies or the elite.</p>
    <p>Be­sides Mr Gi­bran, the pres­i­dent’s son-in-law Bobby Afif Na­su­tion was also a may­oral can­di­date in Medan and un­of­fi­cial tal­lies showed him as front run­ner there.</p>
    <p>Their can­di­da­cies had stirred spec­u­la­tion that Mr Joko was try­ing to build a po­lit­i­cal dy­nasty, but as early as De­cem­ber last year, the Pres­i­dent, or Jokowi as he is known, had de­nied his in­volve­ment.</p>
    <p>“It’s up to the peo­ple to de­cide. Ev­ery­one has the right to vote or be voted for,” said Mr Joko, who started his po­lit­i­cal ca­reer as mayor of his home town Solo from 2005 to 2012, be­fore get­ting elected as Jakarta gover­nor in 2012 and Pres­i­dent in 2014.</p>
    <p>Solo res­i­dent Agung Wi­bowo, 45, said he voted for Mr Gi­bran as he be­lieved the culi­nary en­tre­pre­neur would be “dy­namic, in­no­va­tive and for­ward-look­ing”.</p>
    <p>He added: “We need broad­minded lead­ers, young peo­ple who can come up with new ideas to keep up with the times.”</p>
    <p>Other well-con­nected can­di­dates in­cluded Vice-Pres­i­dent Ma’ruf Amin’s daugh­ter Siti Nur Az­izah and De­fence Min­is­ter Prabowo Su­bianto’s niece Ra­hayu Saraswati Djo­jo­hadikusumo.</p>
