    <p>Hong Kong yes­ter­day dis­qual­i­fied four op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers af­ter China’s Par­lia­ment passed a new rule re­quir­ing the city’s leg­is­la­tors to be pa­tri­ots and al­low­ing the ex­pul­sion of those who fall short with­out hav­ing to go through the courts.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing more than a dozen pro-democ­racy mem­bers in the Hong Kong leg­is­la­ture said later in the day that they would re­sign en masse fol­low­ing news of their peers’ dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Q What does the new Chi­nese law say?</p>
    <p>A The res­o­lu­tion passed yes­ter­day by China’s top leg­isla­tive body – the Na­tional Peo­ple’s Congress Stand­ing Com­mit­tee (NPCSC) – stip­u­lates that law­mak­ers should be dis­qual­i­fied if they sup­port Hong Kong in­de­pen­dence, refuse to ac­knowl­edge China’s sovereignt­y over the city, ask for­eign forces to in­ter­fere in its af­fairs, fail to up­hold the Ba­sic Law or pledge al­le­giance to Hong Kong, or in any other way threaten na­tional se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Q Why was the rule im­posed?</p>
    <p>A The de­ci­sion came af­ter long-drawn frus­tra­tion in Hong Kong’s pro-Bei­jing cir­cles over op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers’ fil­i­bus­ter­ing and de­lay tac­tics to ob­struct leg­is­la­tion from be­ing passed. The move is “con­ducive to the long-term peace and sta­bil­ity, as well as pros­per­ity and de­vel­op­ment of Hong Kong”, said NPCSC chair­man Li Zhan­shu.</p>
    <p>Q Who are the four law­mak­ers dis­qual­i­fied?</p>
    <p>A The four un­seated law­mak­ers – Mr Alvin Ye­ung, Mr Kwok Ka Ki and Mr Den­nis Kwok of the Civic Party, and Mr Ken­neth Le­ung of the Pro­fes­sion­als Guild – are among 12 who were ear­lier barred from stand­ing in a leg­isla­tive elec­tion that has since been post­poned to next year. The group had called on US of­fi­cials to sanc­tion those re­spon­si­ble for al­leged hu­man rights abuses in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Q How many op­po­si­tion mem­bers are there in the Hong Kong leg­is­la­ture?</p>
    <p>A Sixty-two l aw­mak­ers cur­rently sit in the city’s 70-seat leg­is­la­ture, in­clud­ing 19 from the op­po­si­tion camp and two prodemoc­racy in­de­pen­dents. The pro-es­tab­lish­ment camp oc­cu­pies 41 seats, one short of a twothirds ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>Q What does all this mean for Hong Kong?</p>
    <p>A The dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tion of the four law­mak­ers and sub­se­quent res­ig­na­tion of the re­main­ing pro-democ­racy mem­bers, if it goes through, will ren­der the cham­ber with­out any op­po­si­tion voices, turn­ing it into a rub­ber-stamp leg­is­la­ture. The de­vel­op­ment is likely to fuel con­cern in the West over Hong Kong’s au­ton­omy as promised un­der the “one coun­try, two sys­tems” prin­ci­ple.</p>
