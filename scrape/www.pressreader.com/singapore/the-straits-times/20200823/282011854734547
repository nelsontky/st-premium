    <p>FEL­TON (United States) • Cal­i­for­nia’s light­ning-sparked wild­fires more than dou­bled in size into some of the largest in state history on Fri­day, with one blaze ad­vanc­ing to within 1.6km of the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia Santa Cruz (UCSC).</p>
    <p>At least six peo­ple have died, 43 fire­fight­ers and civil­ians have been in­jured, and more than 500 homes and other struc­tures de­stroyed as fires have burned an area larger than the US state of Rhode Is­land.</p>
    <p>Fire­fight­ing forces were de­pleted as they fought around 560 blazes.</p>
    <p>Only 45 of 375 out-of-state fire crews re­quested by Cal­i­for­nia had ar­rived, said a spokesman for wild­fire author­ity Cal Fire.</p>
    <p>The state has been hit by its worst dry-light­ning storms in nearly two decades.</p>
    <p>Close to 12,000 light­ning strikes have sent fire rac­ing through lands parched by record-break­ing heat, forc­ing 175,000 peo­ple to evac­u­ate their homes, largely in North­ern Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>The light­ning strikes, driven by record tem­per­a­tures, were a con­se­quence of cli­mate change and more such storms are ex­pected to­day,</p>
    <p>Gov­er­nor Gavin New­som told a news con­fer­ence on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“If you are in de­nial about cli­mate change, come to Cal­i­for­nia,” Mr New­som told the Demo­cratic Na­tional Con­ven­tion on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>One of the hottest air tem­per­a­tures recorded any­where on the planet in at least a cen­tury, and pos­si­bly ever, was reached last week­end at Death Val­ley in Cal­i­for­nia’s Mo­jave Desert, where it soared to 54.4 deg C.</p>
    <p>Most of the fires are in the San Fran­cisco Bay Area, with a com­plex of blazes east of Palo Alto and another in Wine Coun­try south of Sacramento now the sev­enth and 10th largest in state history, re­spec­tively, ac­cord­ing to Cal Fire.</p>
    <p>In Santa Cruz, a city of around 65,000, res­i­dents were told to have evac­u­a­tion “go bags” at the ready.</p>
    <p>Bull­doz­ers dug fire lines on the north­ern flank of the UCSC cam­pus, around 4.8km north-west of the coastal city’s board­walk. Videos showed gi­ant red­wood trees, some over 2,000 years old, stand­ing largely un­scathed among the torched ru­ins of build­ings in Cal­i­for­nia’s old­est state park to the north.</p>
    <p>“The fire con­tin­ues to ad­vance, and much of what will hap­pen next de­pends on weather con­di­tions such as wind di­rec­tion and speed,” UCSC chan­cel­lor Cyn­thia Larive wrote in a tweet, after or­der­ing the evac­u­a­tion of the cam­pus.</p>
