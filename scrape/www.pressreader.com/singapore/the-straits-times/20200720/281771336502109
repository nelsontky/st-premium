    <p>As a res­i­dent of the hu­mid coastal In­dian city of Chen­nai, Mr Ang­shu­man De al­ways en­joyed be­ing in cooler climes and would es­cape when­ever pos­si­ble to the Hi­malayas for high-al­ti­tude treks.</p>
    <p>And it is these moun­tains that the fi­nan­cial ser­vices pro­fes­sional has turned to yet again to break the monotony of work­ing from his apart­ment since March 25, when In­dia went into a lock­down.</p>
    <p>“It has been men­tally ex­haust­ing be­ing re­stricted to my apart­ment for more than three months now,” Mr De, 44, told The Straits Times. “There has been no change.”</p>
    <p>With no clar­ity on when phys­i­cal workspaces will re­open, he has now de­cided to move to a home­s­tay in Naddi in the north­ern In­dian state of Hi­machal Pradesh for the next few months. Get­ting there will re­quire two flights as well as a short drive from Dharamshal­a, the near­est air­port.</p>
    <p>“I am lo­ca­tion ag­nos­tic and can work from any­where as long as there is a good broad­band con­nec­tion. So why should I be re­stricted to Chen­nai?” he pointed out.</p>
    <p>It is peo­ple like Mr De, filled with ir­re­press­ible wan­der­lust and able to work re­motely, that the In­dian travel and hos­pi­tal­ity in­dus­try is now bank­ing on for re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Such busi­nesses were forced to shut in March, in­cur­ring bil­lions of ru­pees in losses, and have re­opened cau­tiously only last month fol­low­ing an eas­ing of re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>To lure back trav­ellers, they have launched spe­cial “stay­ca­tion” and</p>
    <p>“worka­tion” pack­ages at at­trac­tive prices, com­bined with Covid-19 safety mea­sures .</p>
    <p>A sur­vey in May by Thomas Cook and SOTC Travel found that 64 per cent of re­spon­dents “are likely” to take a do­mes­tic hol­i­day this year. Both firms launched pack­ages re­cently tar­get­ing do­mes­tic trav­ellers look­ing for short or longer breaks.</p>
    <p>While pas­sen­ger trains are still not op­er­a­tional, do­mes­tic flights have re­sumed and of­fer an­other op­tion for those look­ing to travel, in ad­di­tion to driv­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Daniel D’souza, pres­i­dent and coun­try head, leisure, at SOTC Travel, said there is a pent-up travel de­mand be­cause of the re­stric­tions peo­ple were faced with dur­ing the coun­try­wide lock­down that lasted for more than two months.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple want to get out, at least drive some­where for a hol­i­day,” he told ST, adding that his firm has seen an uptick in travel to des­ti­na­tions that are a drive away.</p>
    <p>These places in­clude Lon­avla near Mum­bai and Jaipur, which is around 280km away from Delhi.</p>
    <p>Homes­tays Of In­dia (HOI), a travel en­ter­prise that lists around 160 home­s­tay op­tions across the coun­try on its por­tal, has been re­ceiv­ing around 20 queries each week – all for long stays of around a month or two from peo­ple look­ing to com­bine a vacation with work.</p>
    <p>“For us, it is a new thing,” said Mr Vinod Verma, di­rec­tor of HOI, which launched its “Work From Home­s­tay” op­tion last month.</p>
    <p>But be­fore trav­ellers head for their favourite hol­i­day spots, they will have to ne­go­ti­ate a com­plex set of rules that re­main fluid, as the pan­demic un­folds with vary­ing in­ten­sity across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, to get to his home­s­tay in Hi­machal Pradesh, Mr De will first have to pro­duce a Covid-19-neg­a­tive re­port from a gov­ern­ment-recog­nised lab­o­ra­tory that dates no more than 72 hours be­fore his ar­rival, reg­is­ter on a state gov­ern­ment por­tal 48 hours be­fore ar­rival, and show proof of hav­ing booked an ac­com­mo­da­tion for at least five days.</p>
    <p>As he is trav­el­ling from Chen­nai, which is a hot spot, he may have to un­dergo an­other test and be quar­an­tined for 14-28 days if re­quired.</p>
    <p>But de­spite these of­fi­cial mea­sures al­low­ing the re­sump­tion of do­mes­tic tourism, lo­cals in cer­tain ar­eas have pre­vented the open­ing of es­tab­lish­ments for fear of out­siders bring­ing in in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Coorg, a pop­u­lar hilly re­treat in Kar­nataka, saw some tourists last month as es­tab­lish­ments des­per­ate for some busi­ness there re­opened.</p>
    <p>But op­po­si­tion from lo­cals as well as sparse foot­fall of around 2 per cent of reg­u­lar traf­fic led to their clo­sure after about a fort­night.</p>
    <p>The dis­trict ad­min­is­tra­tion also fol­lowed this up with an or­der on July 7, ask­ing own­ers of all ho­tels and homes­tays to stop ac­cept­ing new book­ings and can­cel those made in ad­vance till fur­ther no­tice.</p>
    <p>In­dia has more than 935,000 Covid-19 cases and over 24,300 deaths, and a peak is still said to be months away.</p>
    <p>“We frankly are not ex­pect­ing busi­ness to come to nor­mal be­fore 2021,” said Mr Verma.</p>
