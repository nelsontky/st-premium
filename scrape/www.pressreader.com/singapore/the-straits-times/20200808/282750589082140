    <p>NO RE­PLY TO BIRTH­DAY WISHES: Singer Will Pan (right) turned 40 on Thursday, but he might not be in the mood to cel­e­brate given the neg­a­tive pub­lic­ity fol­low­ing the news of his mar­riage.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral of his celebrity friends, in­clud­ing Rainie Yang and her hus­band Li Rong­hao and ac­tress Michelle Chen, had wished him happy birth­day on Weibo.</p>
    <p>But the Tai­wanese-Amer­i­can singer did not re­ply to any of them.</p>
    <p>His wife Luna Xuan, 26, did not send him any birth­day wishes on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Pan, who shot to fame with songs such as Gecko Stroll (2002) and</p>
    <p>Wu Ha (2004), an­nounced late last month that he had tied the knot with the Chi­nese air stew­ardess.</p>
    <p>But he was later ac­cused of be­ing “dis­hon­est” as he was be­lieved to have taken part in celebrity dat­ing show We Are In Love in 2017 while dat­ing Xuan at the same time.</p>
    <p>This was fol­lowed by talk that his wife was part of a “train­ing camp” for women who want to marry su­per­stars, along with Chi­nese model Moka Fang, wife of Hong Kong star Aaron Kwok.</p>
    <p>Fang has dis­missed the on­line snip­ing, while Pan’s agency warned last week that he will pur­sue le­gal ac­tion against any­one who con­tin­ues to spread li­bel­lous com­ments about him and his wife.</p>
    <p>On Thursday, his la­bel also urged fans not to be­lieve in ru­mours.</p>
