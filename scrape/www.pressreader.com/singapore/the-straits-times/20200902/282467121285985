    <p>Fly ANC, the wire­less over-ear head­phone model of au­dio com­pany Har­man Kar­don’s new Fly head­phone se­ries, comes with ac­tive noise-can­celling (ANC) tech­nol­ogy and a sleek, black min­i­mal­ist de­sign.</p>
    <p>It feels pre­mium as well, with a leatherett­e ma­te­rial cov­er­ing most of its ex­te­rior, in­clud­ing the head­band and ear cups.</p>
    <p>Its con­struc­tion is sturdy, though the head­band feels tight. Even af­ter I tried stretch­ing it out, the head­band firmly re­tains its shape and clamps my head tightly.</p>
    <p>The ear cups are a tad small for me and just about cover my ears. As a re­sult, my ears feel warm af­ter an hour of lis­ten­ing, though this might be a good thing when I can travel to colder coun­tries again.</p>
    <p>On the left ear cup is a mi­cro-USB charg­ing port. This is a sur­prise, as most wire­less head­phones use the USB-C port for charg­ing. It might also be a has­sle for users whose smart­phones use USB-C.</p>
    <p>All of the con­trols – vol­ume, play­back, Blue­tooth, ANC and power – are found on the right ear cup. This makes it quick and easy to change con­trols, as there are no touch ges­tures to re­mem­ber.</p>
    <p>You can down­load the My Har­man/Kar­don Head­phones app (avail­able on An­droid and iOS) to se­lect Google As­sis­tant or Ama­zon Alexa as your voice as­sis­tant, as well as change or cus­tomise the equaliser set­tings. The app comes with three equaliser pre­sets: Jazz, Bass and Vo­cal.</p>
    <p>Au­dio qual­ity is im­pres­sive, with sparkly highs, smooth mids and punchy bass. Even when you set the equaliser to the Bass setting, vo­cals are clear and not over­pow­ered by bass. If you love pop songs, the Vo­cal pre­set works a treat.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in terms of ANC per­for­mance, the Fly ANC is prob­a­bly a notch below genre lead­ers such as the Sony WH-1000XM3 and the Bose NC Head­phones 700. With the ANC turned on, I could still hear the loud mu­sic that neigh­bours in my block were blast­ing.</p>
    <p>But the ANC func­tion could be use­ful when you can travel again – it ef­fec­tively blocked out my “recre­ation” of the en­gine hum in­side an air­plane cabin by turn­ing up the fan of my study’s decade-old air­con­di­tion­ing unit to the max­i­mum setting.</p>
    <p>On the pric­ing front, the Fly ANC ($349) has a clear edge over the WH-1000XM3 and the NC Head­phones 700, both of which cost more than $500.</p>
    <p>It also comes with a hard case that re­sem­bles the one found in the WH-1000XM3. The case holds the head­phone, along with ca­bles and the in­cluded air­plane au­dio adapter. Many of its com­peti­tors either do not have one or of­fer only a fab­ric bag.</p>
    <p>Bat­tery life is pretty good, at 20 hours with ANC turned on. This is sim­i­lar to the stamina of the NC Head­phones 700, but not as good as WH-1000XM3’s 30-hour bat­tery life.</p>
