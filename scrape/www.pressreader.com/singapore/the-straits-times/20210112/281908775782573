        <p>In post-pan­demic Sin­ga­pore, reg­u­lar home-based learn­ing is set to be the new nor­mal. Even as we push to ex­pand digital learn­ing, a trend that has ac­cel­er­ated as a re­sult of Covid-19 dis­rup­tions across the world, we must take care to un­cover the mis­con­cep­tions that could un­der­mine its suc­cess.</p>
        <p>Find­ings from two stud­ies con­ducted by the au­thors dur­ing and af­ter the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod of al­most two months be­tween April and June last year in Sin­ga­pore point to gaps be­tween re­al­ity and digital myths that shape every­day teach­ing and learn­ing.</p>
        <p>In one study, we con­ducted a large-scale sur­vey of 2,012</p>
        <p>Pri­mary 4 and 5 pupils’ bilin­gual leisure read­ing habits be­fore and dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod when stu­dents shifted to Full Home-Based Learn­ing (FHBL), and in­ter­viewed 36 chil­dren from one pri­mary school.</p>
        <p>In an­other study, we con­ducted in-depth on­line in­ter­views with five par­ents and their ado­les­cent chil­dren to learn how they used tech­nol­ogy for learn­ing, read­ing and leisure dur­ing FHBL.</p>
        <p>THE MYTH OF THE DIGITAL NA­TIVE</p>
        <p>The term “digital na­tive” was coined by Amer­i­can writer Marc Pren­sky in 2001 to de­scribe the gen­er­a­tion that grew up in an era of ubiq­ui­tous com­puter and In­ter­net ac­cess. He ar­gued that the older teach­ers, who were not born into the digital world, were digital im­mi­grants who would need to adapt to teach the new gen­er­a­tion.</p>
        <p>Par­ents we in­ter­viewed adopted this view of the tech-savvy child, with one mother telling us that “tech is their world”, and an­other say­ing how she re­lied on her teenager to create In­sta­gram videos to pro­mote their food dis­tri­bu­tion ini­tia­tive dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
        <p>This myth of the digital na­tive ob­scures the per­spec­tive that chil­dren and ado­les­cents are digital na­tives in some as­pects of their lives, but not oth­ers.</p>
        <p>Sim­i­lar to find­ings from the United States, Bri­tain and Aus­tralia, the pri­mary school pupils sur­veyed and in­ter­viewed in our study re­ported that they</p>
        <p>were more likely to use their mo­bile phones and elec­tronic de­vices for gam­ing, watch­ing YouTube videos and us­ing so­cial me­dia, such as In­sta­gram and TikTok, than for read­ing.</p>
        <p>Of the 2,012 pri­mary school pupils sur­veyed, only 19.1 per cent of them re­ported us­ing the Na­tional Li­brary Board app to ac­cess English e-read­ing re­sources. The ma­jor­ity of them did not know how to find books on­line and pre­ferred to read print books. Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, time spent on de­vices was neg­a­tively cor­re­lated to time spent on read­ing and an in­creased en­joy­ment of read­ing.</p>
        <p>Left to their own de­vices, few chil­dren were likely to use de­vices for read­ing.</p>
        <p>THE MYTH OF EQUAL AC­CESS</p>
        <p>It is of­ten as­sumed that hav­ing ac­cess to com­put­ers and the In­ter­net will lead to equal learn­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for all stu­dents. In de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, the pro­vi­sion of tech­no­log­i­cal de­vices and In­ter­net ac­cess are in­deed ways to im­prove such ac­cess. How­ever, in de­vel­oped coun­tries such as Sin­ga­pore, clos­ing the digital di­vide be­tween the haves and have-nots can­not stop with just the pro­vi­sion of ac­cess to de­vices and the In­ter­net.</p>
        <p>The con­cept of Digital Di­vide 2.0 sug­gests that un­equal digital lit­er­acy skills to nav­i­gate the on­line en­vi­ron­ment and use of</p>
        <p>tech­nol­ogy for pro­duc­tive pur­poses is the real chasm.</p>
        <p>Ed­u­ca­tors need to be in­ten­tional in the de­vel­op­ment of stu­dents’ digital lit­era­cies to har­ness tech­nol­ogy and in­for­ma­tion for crit­i­cal think­ing and cre­ative pro­duc­tion. This could in­clude fa­cil­i­tat­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for stu­dents to eval­u­ate sources of in­for­ma­tion, de­velop digital au­thor­ing skills and create space for tinker­ing.</p>
        <p>When it comes to read­ing, chil­dren who are mo­ti­vated to read in­de­pen­dently for plea­sure and learn­ing are more likely to read more, thus be­com­ing bet­ter and more flu­ent read­ers. This early read­ing pro­fi­ciency has an im­pact on later read­ing de­vel­op­ment, as well as stu­dents’ digital lit­er­acy skills – that is, their abil­ity to search, nav­i­gate and make use of the in­for­ma­tion on the In­ter­net.</p>
        <p>Mere ac­cess to tech­nol­ogy, how­ever, does not lead to more read­ing among stu­dents un­less schools in­te­grate it into their cur­ricu­lum. The in­for­ma­tion on sum­mer-read­ing loss in the US high­lights that pro­longed breaks from school can re­sult in widen­ing gaps be­tween stu­dents’ read­ing. Unen­gaged stu­dents of­ten end up read­ing less dur­ing sum­mer, un­less there were in­ter­ven­tions en­cour­ag­ing hol­i­day read­ing.</p>
        <p>We saw ev­i­dence of hol­i­day read­ing gain and loss dur­ing FHBL, from the pri­mary school study. Chil­dren who re­ported that they en­joyed read­ing be­fore the cir­cuit</p>
        <p>breaker pe­riod read even more dur­ing the pe­riod. With­out the need to wake up early, a re­duc­tion in school ac­tiv­i­ties and en­rich­ment classes, th­ese chil­dren had more time to spend on read­ing and found it re­lax­ing.</p>
        <p>How­ever, pupils who were al­ready dis­en­gaged read­ers were less likely to read or en­joy read­ing dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod. Out­side the struc­ture of ded­i­cated school read­ing time, they stopped read­ing.</p>
        <p>A teenager who self-iden­ti­fied as a non-avid reader re­ported that she had been read­ing the Jenny Han novel, To All The Boys I’ve Loved Be­fore, reg­u­larly dur­ing the daily Sus­tained Silent Read­ing time in­sti­tuted by her school be­fore the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod. She dis­con­tin­ued the read­ing habit dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
        <p>Chil­dren and ado­les­cents from homes with bet­ter re­sources were more likely to have more books, have ac­cess to reader-friendly de­vices, such as iPads and tablets, and the abil­ity to pur­chase books on­line or sub­scribe to read­ing apps. Lack of ac­cess to phys­i­cal books and knowl­edge about how to ob­tain e-books or on­line read­ing ma­te­rial may hin­der dis­ad­van­taged stu­dents from ac­tual op­por­tu­ni­ties for self-di­rected read­ing and learn­ing.</p>
        <p>THE MYTH OF ON­LINE EN­GAGE­MENT</p>
        <p>Wide­spread con­sump­tion of tech­nol­ogy does not nec­es­sar­ily mean that stu­dents em­brace tech­nol­ogy for learn­ing. A bor­ing les­son can be made worse when trans­lated to a one-hour on­line mono­logue. In our in­ter­views, ado­les­cents and par­ents lamented the abun­dance of work­sheets and lack of “the hu­man touch” dur­ing FHBL.</p>
        <p>There were some ex­cep­tions: An in­ter­ac­tive cook­ing task posted on the Sin­ga­pore Stu­dent Learn­ing Space, which al­lowed mother and child to bond; on­line in­ter-class de­bates and com­pe­ti­tions; and read­ing bin­gos, which en­cour­aged in­de­pen­dent ex­plo­ration of e-books and au­dio­books. The best lessons were those that had clear learn­ing ob­jec­tives, demon­strated aware­ness of the pos­si­bil­i­ties and lim­i­ta­tions of on­line tech­nol­ogy, and of­ten in­volved some form of off­line prepa­ra­tion or ac­tiv­ity.</p>
        <p>As the ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem seeks to create a cul­ture of in­quiry among teach­ers and stu­dents, we need to be­ware the ten­dency for whole­sale trans­la­tion of phys­i­cal lessons into on­line lessons with­out con­sid­er­ing how the digital medium can of­fer dif­fer­ent pos­si­bil­i­ties for the learn­ing ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
        <p>The on­line medium can fa­cil­i­tate in­quiry, but learn­ing by in­quiry re­quires good les­son de­sign. To ask in­ter­est­ing ques­tions and pur­sue them with rigour re­quires a set of skills dif­fer­ent from fill­ing out a work­sheet, which tends to be overem­pha­sised in ex­am­i­na­tion-ori­ented sys­tems.</p>
        <p>Our stu­dents want and expect to be en­gaged with tech­nol­ogy, but we need to chal­lenge the com­mon as­sump­tions in on­line learn­ing... De­sign­ing en­gag­ing and mean­ing­ful on­line learn­ing ex­pe­ri­ences will take prac­tice and hard work. To truly en­sure that blended learn­ing will work for all stu­dents in Sin­ga­pore, we need to go back to the draw­ing board, de­bunk the digital myths and put the child, not tech­nol­ogy, at the heart of our teach­ing and learn­ing ini­tia­tives.</p>
        <p>DE­BUNK THE MYTHS</p>
        <p>As we move towards blended learn­ing, we need to recog­nise the po­ten­tial and lim­i­ta­tions of tech­nol­ogy. Struc­tur­ing blended learn­ing into the cur­ricu­lum and pro­vid­ing equal ac­cess to de­vices for stu­dents are a good start.</p>
        <p>Our stu­dents want and expect to be en­gaged with tech­nol­ogy, but we need to chal­lenge the com­mon as­sump­tions in on­line learn­ing. Even as “digital na­tives”, our stu­dents are not ho­mo­ge­neous and have dif­fer­ent lev­els of digital lit­er­acy skills. De­sign­ing en­gag­ing and mean­ing­ful on­line learn­ing ex­pe­ri­ences will take prac­tice and hard work.</p>
        <p>To truly en­sure that blended learn­ing will work for all stu­dents in Sin­ga­pore, we need to go back to the draw­ing board, de­bunk the digital myths and put the child, not tech­nol­ogy, at the heart of our teach­ing and learn­ing ini­tia­tives.</p>
