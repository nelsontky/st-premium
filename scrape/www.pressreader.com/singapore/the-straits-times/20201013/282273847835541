    <p>That is the beauty of the Na­tions League, you get games against this level of op­po­nent. It’s a great ex­pe­ri­ence for them, and to go and win it should give them a sense of what might be pos­si­ble in the next few years.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>LON­DON It was a for­tu­itous win, but af­ter hav­ing lost their past two meet­ings – both at the 2018 World Cup – Eng­land will be buoyed by the Wembley con­fi­dence-booster.</p>
    <p>That was the as­ser­tion of Three Lions man­ager Gareth South­gate af­ter his side ground out a 2-1 vic­tory over Bel­gium on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The vis­i­tors ar­rived in Lon­don as the No. 1 side in the world fol­low­ing a run of 12 con­sec­u­tive com­pet­i­tive wins.</p>
    <p>It ap­peared the Red Devils would ex­tend that streak af­ter</p>
    <p>Romelu Lukaku’s early penalty put them in front but Eng­land bounced back through Mar­cus Rashford’s spot kick, be­fore a wicked de­flec­tion saw Ma­son Mount grab the win­ner 25 min­utes from time.</p>
    <p>Both sides were miss­ing key per­son­nel – South­gate could not call on Ra­heem Ster­ling and Ben Chilwell, while cap­tain Harry Kane was only fit enough to fea­ture as a sec­ond-half sub­sti­tute. Bel­gium were with­out Eden Hazard and Thibaut Cour­tois.</p>
    <p>But Roberto Martinez’s men were the far brighter side from the start, with Eng­land forced to weather a Bel­gian storm.</p>
    <p>While Bel­gium made their pres­sure count through Lukaku, they failed to build on their lead, with Yan­nick Car­rasco wast­ing two gilt­edged chances, as the hosts, who are ranked world No. 4, worked their way back into the game.</p>
    <p>De­spite in­ter­na­tional foot­ball only restart­ing last month – some 10 months af­ter the last matches were staged ow­ing to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic – Eng­land have not shown much rusti­ness, with three wins in four games since.</p>
    <p>South­gate be­lieves that by up­set­ting Bel­gium, his side gave a glimpse of what they can achieve at next year’s Euro 2020 and be­yond.</p>
    <p>“We are not go­ing to face a more dif­fi­cult game de­fen­sively,” he said. “It was a bril­liant test, the sort of test we need.</p>
    <p>“That is the beauty of the Na­tions League, you get games against this level of op­po­nent. It’s a great ex­pe­ri­ence for them, and to go and win it should give them a sense of what might be pos­si­ble in the next few years.</p>
    <p>“They caused us a lot of prob­lems down the sides of our de­fen­sive block with over­load­ing the wide ar­eas, and we knew that would hap­pen.</p>
    <p>“But re­solv­ing those is­sues in real time, live, was dif­fi­cult for the play­ers, so it was a huge test to come through that.”</p>
    <p>Jor­dan Hen­der­son, who drew the foul for Rashford’s penalty, agreed, adding: “We want to com­pete with the very best teams, and Bel­gium are cer­tainly that.</p>
    <p>“We com­peted very well and that’s what we want to do, keep com­pet­ing and grow­ing, and you never know where that may take us.”</p>
    <p>For Martinez, this was his sec­ond stum­ble in four days – they drew 1-1 with Ivory Coast in a friendly last Fri­day – and while he re­mains con­fi­dent of get­ting re­venge when Eng­land travel to Bel­gium next month for their re­verse Na­tions League tie, he be­moaned the lack of a video as­sis­tant ref­eree here.</p>
    <p>Car­rasco had a goal ruled out for a mar­ginal off­side call against Ti­mothy Castagne, but the Spa­niard in­sisted he was on­side, claim­ing that “it would have been a very dif­fer­ent game” had the tech­nol­ogy been used.</p>
