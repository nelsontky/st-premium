    <p>MUGELLO • Formula One needed Se­bas­tian Vet­tel to stay in the sport and Racing Point, who be­come As­ton Martin F1 next sea­son, made a smart move in sign­ing him, said six-time world cham­pion Lewis Hamil­ton.</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old Bri­ton said at the Tus­can Grand Prix that Vet­tel’s move from Fer­rari to the Sil­ver­stone-based team, an­nounced ear­lier, was ex­cit­ing for the sport.</p>
    <p>“It’s quite a big shift from Fer­rari to an up-and-com­ing team,” he told Sky Sports tele­vi­sion at the</p>
    <p>Mugello cir­cuit. “Formula One needs to keep the great driver that he is in the sport, so I’m happy that he’s con­tin­u­ing and not stop­ping.</p>
    <p>“I’m just re­ally happy for him be­cause it’s not been the eas­i­est of jour­neys at Fer­rari, and I think he’ll learn so much from there.”</p>
    <p>Vet­tel has won 14 grands prix since join­ing Fer­rari in 2015, mak­ing him their third-most suc­cess­ful driver be­hind Michael Schu­macher and Niki Lauda. But he has en­dured a dif­fi­cult sea­son, with Fer­rari hav­ing to go into the team’s 1,000th F1 race deny­ing they are in a cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Af­ter two point-less races at SpaFran­cor­champs and Monza, Fer­rari fell to sixth in the con­struc­tors’ cham­pi­onship last Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Racing Point have said four-time world cham­pion Vet­tel will drive for them next year and be­yond, re­plac­ing Mex­i­can Ser­gio Perez.</p>
    <p>Vet­tel, 33, had come close to re­tir­ing be­fore the deal. His stay­ing means F1 will have three mul­ti­ple world cham­pi­ons still racing, with Spain’s two-time cham­pion Fer­nando Alonso back af­ter two sea­sons out to drive for Re­nault, who will be re­named Alpine F1.</p>
    <p>“I think it’s one of the smartest moves that As­ton Martin could do and I’m ex­cited to see what he con­trib­utes and how he helps progress that team for­ward,” said Hamil­ton, who has shared the podium with Vet­tel 55 times – the most in F1 his­tory.</p>
