    <p>Former na­tional sprinter Poh Seng Song has been ter­mi­nated from his vice-pres­i­dent post at Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics (SA) and banned from hold­ing any of­fice for two terms. SA’s man­age­ment com­mit­tee made the de­ci­sion based on the find­ings of a board of in­quiry. Poh’s lawyers have ap­plied to quash it.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics (SA) has banned its former vice-pres­i­dent (fi­nance and part­ner­ship) Poh Seng Song from hold­ing any of­fice within the ju­ris­dic­tion of the as­so­ci­a­tion and/or its af­fil­i­ates for two terms.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to doc­u­ments filed by Poh’s lawyers in the High Court on Aug 20, SA’s man­age­ment com­mit­tee (MC) made the de­ci­sion based on the find­ings of a board of in­quiry (BOI).</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Poh’s lawyers – he is rep­re­sented by Clarence Lun from Fox­wood LLC – have ap­plied for a quash­ing or­der against the MC’s de­ci­sion made on June 29, which also in­cludes his ter­mi­na­tion and re­moval from the MC and a rep­ri­mand.</p>
    <p>The court doc­u­ments also stated that the BOI was con­vened in March to look into the MC’s What­sApp chat leak. The papers filed by Fox­wood LLC showed that the MC had in a let­ter dated Aug 4 in­formed Poh that it “unan­i­mously agreed” with the find­ings of the BOI.</p>
    <p>The MC de­cided that Poh be ter­mi­nated from his po­si­tion and re­moved from the MC re­gard­less of his res­ig­na­tion, rep­ri­manded and banned from hold­ing any of­fice within the ju­ris­dic­tion of SA and/or its af­fil­i­ates for two con­sec­u­tive terms from next month.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted by The Straits Times, former na­tional sprinter Poh, 37, said he had re­sponded to SA through his lawyers.</p>
    <p>His lawyers had sought to ap­peal against the BOI find­ings, and had re­quested for an open ap­peal hear­ing.</p>
    <p>Poh had also in­di­cated in his af­fi­davit that he had in­tended to con­test the SA elec­tions at its Sept 25 an­nual gen­eral meet­ing.</p>
    <p>He said: “Through­out my en­tire ca­reer in ath­let­ics and my in­volve­ment in (SA) and other ath­letic or­gan­i­sa­tions, my pur­pose was to im­prove ath­let­ics in Sin­ga­pore. It has been my pas­sion and de­sire to see Sin­ga­pore ath­let­ics thrive.”</p>
