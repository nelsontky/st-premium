    <p>A new ex­hibit has been cre­ated to house some spe­cial feath­ered res­i­dents at Jurong Bird Park, said Wildlife Re­serves Sin­ga­pore (WRS).</p>
    <p>Sit­u­ated next to the Hawk Arena, the new aviary ac­com­mo­dates the park’s pi­o­neer gen­er­a­tion of birds that have re­tired from the Kings of the Skies show.</p>
    <p>While they might have left the lime­light, the eight birds of prey from six dif­fer­ent species will con</p>
    <p>tinue to de­light and en­joy their re­tire­ment un­der the watch­ful care of their keep­ers.</p>
    <p>Birds from dif­fer­ent species mix­ing in the aviary is ac­tu­ally good for them, as it stim­u­lates them both phys­i­cally and men­tally, said WRS.</p>
    <p>The old­est res­i­dent is Rod Stewart, an Egyp­tian vul­ture that might be close to 60 years old. Birds of his species have a 21-year life­span in the wild. He now wears a white bib across his chest to pre­vent him from pick­ing at an old wound.</p>
    <p>“By open­ing the aviary to the pub­lic, we hope guests can ap­pre­ci­ate these el­derly an­i­mals and learn how mod­ern zoos care for them,” said Dr Cheng Wen Haur, WRS deputy chief ex­ec­u­tive and chief life sciences of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>Just like peo­ple, many of these older birds have com­mon age-re­lated ail­ments, ex­pe­ri­enc­ing mus­cle at­ro­phy and vi­sion loss as well as hav­ing to take med­i­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Car­los and Jose, two Amer­i­can black vul­ture sib­lings, re­ceive daily medicine in their food for arthri­tis and to keep them ac­tive.</p>
    <p>CARE FOR EL­DERLY AN­I­MALS</p>
    <p>Oth­er­wise, the 22-year-old broth­ers are in good phys­i­cal con­di­tion, pre­fer­ring to perch high up on the aviary.</p>
    <p>All an­i­mals that have reached 75 per cent of their ex­pected life­span are placed un­der a se­nior an­i­mal care plan across WRS’ four wildlife parks.</p>
    <p>Without hav­ing to fend off preda­tors or dis­eases, and with ac­cess to food and qual­ity health­care, an­i­mals un­der hu­man care tend to live longer than their coun­ter­parts in the wild.</p>
    <p>Un­der WRS’ plan, older an­i­mals ben­e­fit from cus­tomised diet and ex­er­cise, as well as more fre­quent visits from the vets.</p>
    <p>They also re­ceive a full health check ev­ery six months and are assessed by their keep­ers and by vets for any health or mo­bil­ity is­sues.</p>
    <p>The se­nior an­i­mal care plan seeks to slow down the on­set of age-re­lated dis­eases and to en­sure the an­i­mals con­tinue to en­joy qual­ity life in their twi­light years, added Dr Cheng.</p>
    <p>By open­ing the aviary to the pub­lic, we hope guests can ap­pre­ci­ate these el­derly an­i­mals and learn how mod­ern zoos care for them.</p>
