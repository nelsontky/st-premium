    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>You have to deal with peo­ple who are push­ing you hard, and you are much bet­ter off if you can force them to stick to the is­sues.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>You are de­fy­ing ex­pec­ta­tions. That could cause some folks to be­come alarmed – just show them that you mean busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>A bit of news or gos­sip could come your way that light­ens your mood con­sid­er­ably. Pass along the good vibes.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Do not take it per­son­ally when a close friend or fam­ily mem­ber mis­reads you. Gen­tly cor­rect him and move on.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>You have a lot to talk about. Try to gen­er­ate in­ter­est in your big ideas be­cause projects that get started to­day could be win­ners.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Try to re­view the lit­tle de­tails of your lat­est big project. You have not spot­ted the flaw yet, but fix­ing it should not be too much work.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Your brain is itch­ing for some­thing new, so give it a great new idea or prob­lem to solve. You may spin off into new realms of imag­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Some­one else of­fers to take over an oner­ous task and you might as well take him or her up on it. Some­times, you need to let some­one else drive.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>You have to stay on the move. It is im­por­tant to stay busy be­cause bore­dom could feel 10 times more in­tense.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>You are sur­rounded by gos­sips and air­heads. You might be able to turn them into an as­set if you can use them to dis­tract your op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>You have to find a bet­ter way to get your mes­sage out. For­tu­nately, your great men­tal en­ergy helps you make your case eas­ily.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>You know that life in­volves change. You are well suited to adapt to mu­ta­bil­ity, so look around and see if you can help some­one else cope.</p>
