    <p>HONG KONG • Po­lice in Hong Kong have ar­rested nine peo­ple sus­pected of help­ing 12 ac­tivists who fled the city in Au­gust, head­ing for Tai­wan but only to be in­ter­cepted by the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties and held on the main­land.</p>
    <p>Rights groups have raised con­cerns as the fam­i­lies of the de­tainees said they were de­nied ac­cess to in­de­pen­dent lawyers, and aired sus­pi­cion that Hong Kong au­thor­i­ties helped in China’s ar­rests.</p>
    <p>Ac­cused of crimes tied to antigov­ern­ment protests i n Hong Kong last year, the group is be­ing de­tained in China’s south­ern city of Shen­zhen af­ter au­thor­i­ties in­ter­cepted their boat and ac­cused them of il­le­gal bor­der cross­ing.</p>
    <p>Po­lice ar­rested four men and five women sus­pected of ar­rang­ing trans­port for the fugi­tives, said Hong Kong po­lice of­fi­cial Ho Chun Tung yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“One di­rec­tion of the in­ves­ti­ga­tion is whether they helped oth­ers to flee,” said Mr Ho, a su­per­in­ten­dent with the force’s or­gan­ised crime and triad bureau, adding that he did not rule out the pos­si­bil­ity of more ar­rests.</p>
    <p>He dis­missed the rel­a­tives’ ac­cu­sa­tions that po­lice in the Asian fi­nan­cial hub had played a role in the ar­rests in China.</p>
    <p>Po­lice also seized HK$500,000 (S$87,500) in cash, com­put­ers, mo­bile phones, and doc­u­ments re­lated to the pur­chase of a boat.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple be­gan flee­ing Hong Kong for self-ruled Tai­wan from the early months of the protests, most of them legally, by air, but some by fish­ing boat, ac­tivists in Taipei who helped Hong Kong cit­i­zens get visas have told Reuters.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong au­thor­i­ties have said those de­tained are to be rep­re­sented by main­land lawyers of their choice, al­beit from a list pro­vided by Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Their fam­i­lies have been of­fered “needed and fea­si­ble” as­sis­tance, which will con­tinue, the au­thor­i­ties have said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, an an­nual World Press Photo ex­hi­bi­tion fea­tur­ing im­ages from Hong Kong’s huge pro-democ­racy protests last year has been shut down in Ma­cau with­out ex­pla­na­tion, spark­ing spec­u­la­tion of po­lit­i­cal pres­sure from Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Both Ma­cau and Hong Kong are for­mer colonies that were granted cer­tain free­doms un­seen in the Chi­nese main­land when they re­turned to com­mu­nist China’s rule.</p>
