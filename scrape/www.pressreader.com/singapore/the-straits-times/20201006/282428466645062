    <p>In­ter­ven­tions and in­ter­mis­sions abound as the Covid-19 pan­demic drives the Es­planade’s an­nual da:ns fes­ti­val on­line. It will present a dig­i­tal fes­ti­val of vir­tual com­mis­sions, dance films and on­line work­shops from Oct 12 to 31.</p>
    <p>From Berlin-based Sin­ga­porean Ming Poon’s The In­ter­ven­tion Of Lone­li­ness to Thai artist Pichet Klunchun’s mini-doc­u­men­tary The In­ter­mis­sion Of No. 60, this year’s line-up re­sponds to the strange in­ter­lude of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Fes­ti­val pro­gram­mer Iris Cheung says: “Dance, an art form which uses the body to ex­press, com­mu­ni­cate and tell sto­ries, may seem ab­stract and dif­fi­cult for some to un­der­stand.</p>
    <p>“This year, we have the added chal­lenge of hav­ing to present the fes­ti­val with­out the im­me­di­acy and in­ti­macy of a live per­for­mance, where the au­di­ence can ex­pe­ri­ence and see phys­i­cal bod­ies breath­ing and danc­ing live in front of them.”</p>
    <p>Though the or­gan­is­ers had been in dis­cus­sions to bring in new head­lin­ers from abroad be­fore Covid-19 struck, plans to present them ei­ther live or dig­i­tally fell through.</p>
    <p>In­stead, they de­cided to re­visit in­ter­na­tional acts whom they had worked with pre­vi­ously, like Ja­panese street dance group s**t kingz, who were fea­tured in last year’s fes­ti­val, and also put out an open call for lo­cal in­de­pen­dent artists to sub­mit new works.</p>
    <p>“Within weeks of var­i­ous lock­down mea­sures glob­ally, a sea of dig­i­tal free-to-view dance works was re­leased by dance artists and com­pa­nies world­wide,” says Ms Cheung.</p>
    <p>“We needed to en­sure that our fes­ti­val’s line-up was not just a repos­i­tory of archival record­ings or dig­i­tal works that had been re­cently shown on other plat­forms.”</p>
    <p>De­spite the pan­demic, the or­gan­is­ers want to get peo­ple danc­ing in their homes, from 10-minute tu­to­ri­als on vogu­ing, and Bol­ly­wood and Ba­li­nese dance to a so­cial me­dia chal­lenge, #dan­s2the­max, which en­cour­ages the pub­lic to at­tempt a short chore­og­ra­phy by Amer­i­can hip-hop dancer Taryn Cheng and share their videos on TikTok and In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>In an­other, very dif­fer­ent time, Sin­ga­porean dance artist Ming Poon stood on the street with a card­board sign that in­vited strangers to stop and slow-dance with him.</p>
    <p>This be­came The In­ter­ven­tion Of Lone­li­ness, which grew out of a pub­lic in­ter­ven­tion that Poon, 52, did in 2014 and later trans­posed onto the stage.</p>
    <p>When the Es­planade ap­proached him in May this year, he and his team were al­ready two months into re­search­ing how they might in­vite strangers to dance with one an­other on-screen.</p>
    <p>“Lone­li­ness didn’t ap­pear af­ter the coro­n­avirus,” says Poon over Zoom from his home in Berlin.</p>
    <p>“It’s an il­lu­sion that the masks and the reg­u­la­tions are caus­ing more lone­li­ness. (The pan­demic) is giv­ing you more time and more aware­ness that there is lone­li­ness, but it has al­ways been there.”</p>
    <p>The work will un­fold live over video con­fer­enc­ing plat­form Zoom, though Poon can­not pre­dict what might hap­pen, as the show hinges on what the au­di­ence does.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery evening is like a so­ci­o­log­i­cal ex­per­i­ment,” he says.</p>
    <p>“It is a very dif­fi­cult medium to work with,” he adds of the tech­nol­ogy. “But I like to work with dif­fi­cult things, be­cause it opens up doors which are amaz­ing.</p>
    <p>“For me, be­ing ‘live’ is not about me and you sit­ting in the same room, that’s not the only ‘live-ness’ that I’m in­ter­ested in. I’m in­ter­ested in the fact that we do not know what hap­pens next, that we share the same un­known. We are in the same space.”</p>
    <p>Poon’s work deals with in­ter­ven­tions, and Covid-19 has proven to be the in­ter­ven­tion of a life­time.</p>
    <p>“This pan­demic has brought out some very beau­ti­ful things that we took for granted,” he says. “That is maybe a good thing, to make ev­ery­one more aware of their priv­i­leges.”</p>
    <p>And will we ever dance with one an­other in the street again? He be­lieves we will.</p>
    <p>“We dance prac­ti­tion­ers are peo­ple who work with the body,” says Poon, who plans to keep adapt­ing the work be­yond da:ns fes­ti­val and ready it for “the next cri­sis”.</p>
    <p>“If a lit­tle mask and 1.5m dis­tance is enough to dis­con­nect us, our prac­tice is not deep enough. Con­nec­tion has so many path­ways. I be­lieve there are al­ways pos­si­bil­i­ties.”</p>
