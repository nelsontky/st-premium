    <p>Andy Mur­ray predicts Rafael Nadal’s record of 13 French Open ti­tles will never be beaten as the Bri­tish for­mer world No. 1 looks to bounce back in Cologne this week from his Roland Gar­ros dis­ap­point­ment.</p>
    <p>Mur­ray, 33, the reign­ing Olympic cham­pion, crashed out of the Grand Slam tour­na­ment in straight sets with a lop­sided first-round loss to Stan Wawrinka last month as he works his way back from hip surgery.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, the Scot watched in awe as Nadal, 34, de­mol­ished No­vak Djokovic 6-0, 6-2, 7-5 in the fi­nal in Paris.</p>
    <p>The Spa­niard has also equalled the all-time record of 20 Grand Slam ti­tles held by Roger Fed­erer, who hailed Nadal’s vic­tory as “one of sport’s greatest achieve­ments”.</p>
    <p>Mur­ray, agree­ing with the Swiss leg­end, doubts any­one will get close to Nadal’s French Open record.</p>
    <p>“It’s an amaz­ing achieve­ment. I don’t think that what he has done at Roland Gar­ros will ever be beaten. I just don’t see it be­ing topped,” he said in Cologne.</p>
    <p>“He is one short of win­ning the same amount of Grand Slams as (Pete) Sam­pras did just at one tour­na­ment. It’s in­cred­i­ble. I don’t think it’ll be re­peated and I don’t think any­one will be close.”</p>
    <p>Nadal was just 19 when he first won at Roland Gar­ros and quickly es­tab­lished him­self as the King of Clay by win­ning four French ti­tles in a row.</p>
    <p>In 2009, he sur­prised ev­ery­one by los­ing to Robin Soder­ling in the fourth round but re­turned the fol­low­ing year to beat the Swede in the fi­nal and start another win­ning run of 39 matches and five ti­tles.</p>
    <p>Djokovic beat him in 2015 and a year later, Nadal had to with­draw af­ter the sec­ond round with a wrist in­jury but he was back on top in 2017 and has re­mained there since.</p>
    <p>“What has changed is age,” Nadal said on Mon­day with a laugh. “The only neg­a­tive is that I am 15 years older. Ev­ery­thing else, the ba­sic and im­por­tant things in my life, have not changed much.</p>
    <p>“I still live prac­ti­cally in the same place, with the same friends and the re­al­ity is that my way of life when I am out of tour­na­ments has changed rel­a­tively lit­tle.”</p>
    <p>Mur­ray reached the sec­ond round of the US Open in his first Slam since hip-resur­fac­ing surgery and Roland Gar­ros was his third tour­na­ment this year.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing needed wild cards to play in Paris and Cologne, the three­time Ma­jor cham­pion hopes the back-to-back ATP in­door tour­na­ments on the Rhine can help im­prove his rank­ing of 115th.</p>
    <p>“It will be good to get a few matches in over these next few weeks – I hope to per­form bet­ter than I did in Paris,” said the Scot. “Phys­i­cally, my body tends to feel bet­ter the more I play.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully, I will play a lot over the next two weeks, per­form well and see how it goes af­ter that.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Scot and three oth­ers have been elected to the ATP Player Coun­cil to re­place the Djokovic-led group that re­signed from the body to form a break­away union, the gov­ern­ing body of men’s ten­nis an­nounced on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Mur­ray, Canada’s Felix AugerAlias­sime, Aus­tralian John Mill­man and French­man Jeremy Chardy will re­place Djokovic, John Is­ner, Vasek Pospisil and Sam Quer­rey – who stepped down to form the Pro­fes­sional Ten­nis Play­ers As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
