    <p>ZURICH • Credit Suisse Group is deal­ing with the fall­out of a fraud in its in­ter­na­tional wealth man­age­ment busi­ness, two years af­ter it was crit­i­cised by a reg­u­la­tor in a sim­i­lar case that rat­tled the bank and raised ques­tions about con­trols.</p>
    <p>The Swiss l en­der dis­missed a Zurich-based banker who forged doc­u­men­ta­tion on an over-the­counter con­tract for an African wealth man­age­ment client, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The de­cep­tion, un­cov­ered ear­lier this year, led to a loss of about 10 mil­lion francs (S$15 mil­lion) for the bank and had also im­pacted ad­di­tional clients, the peo­ple said, ask­ing not to be iden­ti­fied as the mat­ter is pri­vate.</p>
    <p>The lat­est scan­dal fol­lows a re­struc­tur­ing of the risk func­tion at Credit Suisse as chief ex­ec­u­tive Thomas Gottstein seeks to bol­ster over­sight.</p>
    <p>The bank’s rep­u­ta­tion has taken a hit in re­cent months af­ter a dam­ag­ing spy­ing scan­dal and its in­volve­ment in deals linked to failed com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing Luckin Cof­fee and Wire­card.</p>
    <p>“Credit Suisse con­firms a case from the first quar­ter of 2020 in which a small num­ber of clients were af­fected by unau­tho­rised actions of a client ad­viser,” the bank said in a statement. “Credit Suisse took ap­pro­pri­ate le­gal mea­sures and in­formed the af­fected clients and rel­e­vant reg­u­la­tors.”</p>
    <p>The fraud and losses were booked in the unit led by Mr Raj Se­h­gal. The unit serves the non-res­i­dent In­dian com­mu­nity and sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa. Clients are in the process of be­ing com­pen­sated, ac­cord­ing to one of the peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Mr Se­h­gal was named head of the Africa and non-res­i­dent In­dian busi­ness with a di­rect re­port­ing line to former di­vi­sional chief Iqbal Khan two years ago. He is now chair­man be­came the first Reit in Sin­ga­pore to run a DPU-ac­cre­tive, unit buy­back pro­gramme. It had bought and can­celled 95.3 mil­lion units as at Dec 31 last year.</p>
    <p>“We’ve seen the ben­e­fits in our first-half 2020 fi­nan­cial re­sults, where dis­tributable in­come was largely sim­i­lar, but DPU rose due to a smaller unit base.”</p>
    <p>The Reit has also re­duced its over­all cost of debt.</p>
    <p>Kep­pel Reit will re­main Sin­ga­pore-cen­tric, Mr Tham said. “There will be a shift as we raise our over­seas ex­po­sure, but it will be mar­ginal, for ex­am­ple, lift­ing it to 25 per cent or even 30 per cent from 20 per cent.</p>
    <p>“In­vest­ing in as­sets across Aus­tralia and South Korea en­hances our abil­ity to de­liver sus­tain­able re­turns through chang­ing prop­erty cy­cles in these dif­fer­ent mar­kets.”</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian leases tend to run five to 10 years ver­sus Sin­ga­pore’s three to five years. “These longer leases... of­fer more sta­bil­ity and in­crease the Reit’s abil­ity to grow DPU, even if one mar­ket is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a down cy­cle,” he added. of that busi­ness af­ter a shake-up that saw his re­gion merged into the Mid­dle East unit led by Mr Bruno Da­her. In­ter­na­tional wealth man­age­ment which caters to Credit Suisse’s wealthy clients out­side of Switzer­land and Asia re­ported pro­vi­sions for credit losses of 74 mil­lion francs in the first six months.</p>
    <p>The most re­cent fraud echoes a much big­ger case when Pa­trice Lescau­dron, a former star pri­vate banker, was sen­tenced to prison af­ter he forged doc­u­ments to cover mount­ing client losses. Lescau­dron’s ac­tiv­i­ties went un­de­tected by Credit Suisse and his clients for years un­til a mas­sive wrong-way bet on a Cal­i­for­nian drug­maker in 2015 ex­posed his be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>Switzer­land’s fi­nan­cial reg­u­la­tor later iden­ti­fied de­fi­cien­cies in the bank’s anti-money laun­der­ing con­trols and short­com­ings in its over­sight.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal me­dia re­ported that Lescau</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus out­break has cre­ated head­winds, of course.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 has been chal­leng­ing for re­tail and hos­pi­tal­ity as­sets, but for an of­fice land­lord like us with a small re­tail com­po­nent, there’s been min­i­mal im­pact,” Mr Tham notes.</p>
    <p>“None­the­less, there’s a fair amount of un­cer­tainty due to the global re­ces­sion and ris­ing geopo­lit­i­cal ten­sions, so our main fo­cus is en­gage­ment with our tenants.”</p>
    <p>At one end of the spec­trum, techre­lated tenants are still ex­pand­ing, fuelled by dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion trends that ac­cel­er­ated in the pan­demic. At the other end, hos­pi­tal­ity and travel-re­lated busi­nesses are strug­gling.</p>
    <p>Fu­ture-proof­ing the Reit’s com­mer­cial spa­ces is key, Mr Tham says. “We need to en­sure our build­ings have the best-in-class in­fra­struc­ture such as... ad­vanced fil­tra­tion sys­tems.”</p>
    <p>The fo­cus on fu­ture-proof­ing can be seen from the use of a se­cu­rity ro­bot that pa­trols Ocean Fi­nan­cial Cen­tre to en­force safe-dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Longer term, how tenants use spadron has since died by sui­cide.</p>
    <p>Wealth man­age­ment head Philipp Wehle has been re­view­ing the busi­ness as part of a wider re­vamp of the bank. The wealth busi­ness is re­shap­ing how it lends against hard-to-sell as­sets, as well as its ex­po­sure to the oil and gas in­dus­try and ship­ping, which have been hit hard by re­cent mar­ket dis­lo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Gottstein, who took over in Fe­bru­ary af­ter the es­pi­onage scan­dal led to the ouster of former chief ex­ec­u­tive Tid­jane Thiam, is work­ing to re­store calm af­ter a tur­bu­lent pe­riod dur­ing the coro­n­avirus out­break. In April, Credit Suisse took a large hit in its Asian busi­ness, set­ting aside about US$100 mil­lion (S$136 mil­lion) for soured loans which mostly re­lated to three cases, the largest of which was Luckin, where the bank had or­gan­ised a mar­gin loan for founder Lu Zhengyao.</p>
    <p>The bank also helped sell US$1 bil­lion of Wire­card-linked se­cu­ri­ties last year af­ter ques­tions were raised about the Ger­man com­pany’s ac­count­ing, months be­fore it was ex­posed as a fraud.</p>
    <p>As part of a broader over­haul at the bank an­nounced last month, Mr Gottstein pro­moted Ms Lara Warner to be­come group chief risk and com­pli­ance of­fi­cer. Ms Ly­die Hud­son, who was in charge of com­pli­ance, is tak­ing on a new role in sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>IM­POR­TANT LES­SON</p>
    <p>My god­fa­ther taught me the im­por­tance of wis­dom and un­der­stand­ing. Both are tied to two key skills – the will­ing­ness to learn, as well as the abil­ity to learn con­tin­u­ously – and in­volve lots of hard work.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>MR PAUL THAM , chief ex­ec­u­tive of Kep­pel Reit Man­age­ment, on his two touch­stones of wis­dom and learn­ing.</p>
    <p>ces will also evolve. Mr Tham says: “Phys­i­cal of­fices will re­main a ne­ces­sity, al­though the form and func­tions of the of­fice will evolve.</p>
    <p>“Many firms will likely in­cor­po­rate work-from-home pro­to­cols... and em­ploy­ees and tenants will want more flex­i­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>“Space for each em­ployee may be in­creased to in­cor­po­rate so­cial dis­tanc­ing within an of­fice lay­out, re­vers­ing the trend of higher den­sity over the last two decades.”</p>
    <p>The re­sult­ing im­pact on of­fice de­mand is likely to be a mea­sured one as tenants re­assess their needs.</p>
    <p>In tan­dem with these con­sid­er­a­tions, the re­po­si­tion­ing of as­sets has emerged and will con­tinue to gain mo­men­tum. Mr Tham says: “At the end of the day, own­ing the right as­sets will be in­stru­men­tal to land­lords sur­viv­ing, and thriv­ing.”</p>
