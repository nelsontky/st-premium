    <p>Dengue cases fell by around 20 per cent last week, but weekly num­bers re­main high, the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It cau­tioned that while the 1,341 cases last week is more than 400 cases be­low the peak of 1,792 re­ported in the third week of July, Sin­ga­pore is still in the midst of the tra­di­tional dengue sea­son from May to Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>There were 1,668 cases in the first week of this month.</p>
    <p>The NEA is tak­ing an ex­tra step in larger dengue clus­ter ar­eas by work­ing with the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion to pro­vide mos­quito re­pel­lent to schools lo­cated in these sites.</p>
    <p>“This is to fur­ther pro­tect the young from get­ting in­fected with dengue, and also to get their fam­ily mem­bers used to tak­ing steps to pro­tect them­selves,” it said.</p>
    <p>More than 46,000 bot­tles of mos­quito re­pel­lent have been dis­trib­uted to stu­dents in 37 schools.</p>
    <p>The schools have also pro­cured mos­quito re­pel­lent for use in the class­rooms, while stu­dents are taught three ways to pro­tect them­selves – spray­ing in­sec­ti­cide in dark cor­ners around the home; ap­ply­ing in­sect re­pel­lent reg­u­larly; and don­ning long-sleeved tops to cover their arms and trousers to cover their legs.</p>
    <p>This ini­tia­tive comes as the num­ber of dengue cases this year reached a record high.</p>
    <p>In what ap­pears to be the coun­try’s worst dengue out­break, 25,053 peo­ple have con­tracted the disease this year as of Mon­day, sur­pass­ing the pre­vi­ous full-year high of 22,170 in 2013.</p>
    <p>There were 396 ac­tive dengue clus­ters as of Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The largest clus­ter in the Alju­nied-Gey­lang area has 349 cases, while the Bournemout­h Road clus­ter is the sec­ond largest with 309 cases.</p>
    <p>But things may be im­prov­ing.</p>
    <p>Around 80 per cent – or 1,657 of 2,053 dengue clus­ters – have been closed since the start of this year.</p>
    <p>Some clus­ters, in­clud­ing the Bukit Pan­jang Ring Road clus­ter with 307 cases, have a slower rate of disease trans­mis­sion. They have had an av­er­age of less than one case re­ported daily over the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>The NEA said this is partly ow­ing to the Gov­ern­ment’s in­ten­si­fied dengue in­spec­tion and out­reach ef­forts.</p>
    <p>These in­clude de­ploy­ing vol­un­teers every week­end since the end of June to en­gage over 73,000 res­i­dents in large dengue clus­ter ar­eas, as well as mass pub­lic­ity on tele­vi­sion and on­line plat­forms.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the NEA con­tin­ues to call on res­i­dents to co­op­er­ate with its of­fi­cers do­ing in­spec­tion rounds, as well as to check for and re­move stag­nant wa­ter in their homes at least once a week.</p>
