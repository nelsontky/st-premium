    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX) has given no­tice that it will pro­ceed to delist The Strat­ech Group, which is in liq­ui­da­tion, as it has not sub­mit­ted a pro­posal to re­sume trad­ing af­ter more than three years.</p>
    <p>Un­der list­ing rules, the com­pany or its con­trol­ling share­hold­ers must pro­vide a rea­son­able exit of­fer to share­hold­ers, Strat­ech’s court-ap­pointed liq­uida­tors from BDO Ad­vi­sory said in a fil­ing late on Thurs­day night.</p>
    <p>The sur­veil­lance tech­nol­ogy provider’s con­trol­ling share­hold­ers were the hus­band-and-wife team of ex­ec­u­tive chair­man David Chew and ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor and chief cor­po­rate of­fi­cer Leong Sook Ching.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Thurs­day’s fil­ing, Strat­ech has to in­form SGX of its exit of­fer pro­posal as soon as prac­ti­ca­ble – within one month from the date of the bourse op­er­a­tor’s let­ter to the com­pany – and pro­vide up­dates on SGXNet on the sta­tus of the pro­posal.</p>
    <p>Trad­ing i n the main­board­listed stock will re­main sus­pended un­til the com­ple­tion of the exit of­fer.</p>
    <p>In SGX’s no­ti­fi­ca­tion of delist­ing, the bourse op­er­a­tor also noted that it had “pro­vided am­ple op­por­tu­ni­ties for the liq­uida­tors to sub­mit a re­sump­tion pro­posal based on rep­re­sen­ta­tions that have been made by the liq­uida­tors i n each i nstance”.</p>
    <p>BDO on Thurs­day said that de­spite its best en­deav­ours, Strat­ech had not been able to sub­mit any de­fin­i­tive re­sump­tion pro­posal.</p>
