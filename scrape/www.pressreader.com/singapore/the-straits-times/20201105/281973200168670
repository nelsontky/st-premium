    <p>The pains of dy­nas­tic in­her­i­tance are well chron­i­cled from the book of Ge­n­e­sis to Suc­ces­sion, the United States television drama fea­tur­ing an ail­ing bil­lion­aire and his war­ring chil­dren.</p>
    <p>As the se­ries shows, far from cool­ing tem­pers, the pres­ence of large amounts of money gen­er­ally adds fuel to the flames. Or as one pri­vate banker once told me: “I have never met a fam­ily that was united by its wealth.”</p>
    <p>The heart of the prob­lem is of­ten the deep re­luc­tance of older fam­ily heads to share con­trol with the next gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>They do not trust their suc­ces­sors to do the job as well as they do, es­pe­cially in the case of self-made en­trepreneur­s con­vinced of their ge­nius.</p>
    <p>The lat­est ev­i­dence comes in a sur­vey pub­lished last week by the pri­vate bank­ing arm of Bar­clays which found that 67 per cent of first-gen­er­a­tion cre­ators of fam­ily wealth are “highly cau­tious about re­lin­quish­ing au­thor­ity... and of­ten main­tain a po­si­tion of au­thor­ity well into old age”.</p>
    <p>They do not trust their heirs’ com­mit­ment to the fam­ily busi­ness (63 per cent) or their abil­ity to take over the man­age­ment (57 per cent), the study re­ported. It polled around 400 wealthy peo­ple around the world, in­clud­ing nearly 150 in Britain.</p>
    <p>When it comes to han­dling the fam­ily in­vest­ments – which per­haps re­quires fewer spe­cial skills than the core busi­ness – the level of dis­trust is only slightly lower, at 53 per cent.</p>
    <p>The study echoes oth­ers, in­clud­ing a sur­vey last year by Cam­p­den Re­search and Swiss bank UBS cov­er­ing fam­ily of­fices, which found that 44 per cent of bil­lion­aire and multi-mil­lion­aire clans had no suc­ces­sion plan at all.</p>
    <p>Ad­mit­tedly, the rest of us have a sim­i­lar re­luc­tance to con­tem­plate our own mor­tal­ity.</p>
    <p>A sur­vey of 2,000 peo­ple in Britain last year by Macmil­lan Can­cer Sup­port, a char­ity, found that 42 per cent of those aged over 55 had no will.</p>
    <p>How­ever, you might think that wealthy peo­ple would take more care, as so much more is at stake, es­pe­cially in the case of the own­ers of op­er­at­ing com­pa­nies where a lack of suc­ces­sion plan­ning could un­der­mine the man­age­ment and put jobs at risk.</p>
    <p>But no. If any­thing, all that money – and power – makes for an even greater re­sis­tance to think about the end of things. Ms Effie Dat­son, global head of fam­ily of­fice at Bar­clays Pri­vate Bank, says for some en­trepreneur­s, hand­ing over con­trol of a busi­ness they cre­ated is like “giv­ing up an im­por­tant part of them­selves”.</p>
    <p>Of course, among the costly ser­vices pri­vate bankers of­fer is as­sis­tance with suc­ces­sion plan­ning – “rais­ing the topic very gen­tly”, as Ms Dat­son puts it. But even then, as the sur­vey shows, it can be hard go­ing.</p>
    <p>At least the Covid-19 pan­demic seems to be bring­ing a cold dose of re­al­ity, with many Bri­tons de­cid­ing it is high time to write or up­date their wills. The Bar­clays study says 70 per cent of first-gen­er­a­tion wealth “orig­i­na­tors” are re­assess­ing their busi­ness aims in the light of the pan­demic, with the re­sult that “long-es­tab­lished wealth trans­fer plans will likely need to be re­con­sid­ered”.</p>
    <p>What is to be done?</p>
    <p>Clearly, rich clan chiefs should put head be­fore heart and make de­ci­sions well be­fore the ad­vanc­ing years make it dif­fi­cult or im­pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>They ought to have more faith in the young, es­pe­cially their own chil­dren whom they have brought up, and so pre­sum­ably know well. And, per­haps, more con­fi­dence that the money they have fre­quently lav­ished on their off­spring’s ed­u­ca­tion has not been wasted.</p>
    <p>Ms Dat­son says the idea that heirs are in­ter­ested only in frit­ter­ing away the fam­ily for­tune is “a fal­lacy”. The Bar­clays study shows that among the younger gen­er­a­tion, a full 67 per cent feel a strong sense of duty to­wards their in­her­i­tance.</p>
    <p>But with all that said, there is no fun­da­men­tal rea­son why a for­tune once made should in­crease for ever, or even re­main in­tact.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to US-based Fam­ily Firm In­sti­tute, which has a global mem­ber­ship, fewer than a third of fam­ily busi­nesses sur­vive into the sec­ond gen­er­a­tion; 12 per cent make it to the third, and 3 per cent to the fourth.</p>
    <p>The multi-gen­er­a­tional Roth­schild bank­ing dy­nasty is the ex­cep­tion, not the rule.</p>
    <p>In Bud­den­brooks, a mas­ter­ful novel of fam­ily de­cline, Thomas Mann wrote that the rot fre­quently sets in even be­fore a fam­ily reaches the height of its glory.</p>
    <p>“Of­ten, the out­ward and vis­i­ble ma­te­rial signs and sym­bols of hap­pi­ness and suc­cess only show them­selves when the process of de­cline has al­ready set in.”</p>
    <p>But this is all too glum. Hold­ing to­gether a fam­ily for­tune can­not be an end in it­self. Heirs are surely free to make their own de­ci­sions and lead their own lives. If fam­ily for­tunes are di­vided, as one gen­er­a­tion suc­ceeds another, so what?</p>
    <p>If a fam­ily op­er­at­ing com­pany is sold be­cause no­body wants to run it, does it mat­ter as long as it goes to good hands? If the pro­ceeds are split and the money is spread more widely, more peo­ple might ben­e­fit. And, who knows, the pa­tri­arch or ma­tri­arch may even be more fondly re­mem­bered.</p>
