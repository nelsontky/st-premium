    <p>•</p>
    <p>(Tennessee) First came the warning, then came the blast, shat­ter­ing the Christ­mas morn­ing si­lence in the heart of the city’s tourist district.</p>
    <p>Be­fore dawn on Fri­day, po­lice of­fi­cers in the Amer­i­can city of Nashville rushed to calls of gun­fire on Sec­ond Av­enue, a strip of honky­tonks, restau­rants and boot shops. In­stead of gun­fire, they found a recre­ational ve­hi­cle, blar­ing a strange and un­set­tling mes­sage: There was a bomb. It would det­o­nate in 15 min­utes.</p>
    <p>When the ve­hi­cle did ex­plode, it sent plumes of smoke bil­low­ing above the city, blew out win­dows in shops and of­fices for sev­eral blocks, left three peo­ple hos­pi­talised – and Nashville shaken.</p>
    <p>Po­lice said the ex­plo­sion was de­lib­er­ate. It was also deeply un­set­tling, com­ing in an area that draws thou­sands of peo­ple nightly. But who set it off and why re­mained un­known as of­fi­cials be­gan to make sense of the blast.</p>
    <p>“The whole neigh­bour­hood shook,” said Ms Lily Hansen, who was sit­ting on her couch in her sec­ond-floor apart­ment in a loft build­ing a few blocks away. She looked out­side. “I just can’t get the im­age out of my head.”</p>
    <p>Three peo­ple were in­jured in the blast, though none crit­i­cally. The au­thor­i­ties said it was un­cer­tain whether any­one was in­side the ve­hi­cle when it ex­ploded, but po­lice re­ported hours later that in­ves­ti­ga­tors had found pos­si­ble hu­man re­mains nearby.</p>
    <p>Gas lines were shut off in the area and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions com­pany AT&T ex­pe­ri­enced out­ages, which forced the Fed­eral Avi­a­tion Ad­min­is­tra­tion to tem­po­rar­ily halt flights out of Nashville In­ter­na­tional Air­port.</p>
    <p>Nashville Mayor John Cooper or­dered a cur­few im­posed around the blast site through the hol­i­day weekend as Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion in­ves­ti­ga­tors combed the scene, though po­lice said they were aware of no fur­ther threats to Tennessee’s most pop­u­lous city.</p>
    <p>Fire of­fi­cials said one build­ing across from the blast col­lapsed.</p>
    <p>A voice an­nounced through a speaker from the ve­hi­cle prior to the blast, as cap­tured in a record­ing broad­cast later by lo­cal news sta­tions: “This area must be evac­u­ated now. This area must be evac­u­ated now. If you can hear this mes­sage, evac­u­ate now. If you can hear this mes­sage, evac­u­ate now.”</p>
    <p>And then be­gan a count­down in­ter­spersed with music.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cers quickly went door to door in nearby build­ings to hus­tle peo­ple to safety, and called for dis­patch of the po­lice bomb squad, which was on its way to the scene when the ve­hi­cle blew up, po­lice spokesman Don Aaron said.</p>
    <p>The Metro Nashville Po­lice De­part­ment posted a photo of the ve­hi­cle on Twit­ter and said it had ar­rived in the area at 1.22am.</p>
    <p>The ex­plo­sion oc­curred about two blocks from Lower Broad­way, where some of Nashville’s fa­mous live music venues are lo­cated. The Ry­man Au­di­to­rium, for­mer home of the Grand Ole Opry and just three blocks from the blast scene, was un­dam­aged.</p>
    <p>The Gay­lord Opry­land and cur­rent Grand Ole Opry com­plexes,</p>
    <p>The whole neigh­bour­hood shook...</p>
    <p>I just can’t get the im­age out of my head.</p>
    <p>which sit out­side the down­town area, were not im­pacted.</p>
    <p>“It’s a star­tling thing to have it hap­pen in Nashville so close, and on Christ­mas, but we un­der­stand that Amer­ica is in very tu­mul­tuous times right now,” coun­try singer John Rich, who owns a honky-tonk club a block from the ex­plo­sion, told Reuters.</p>
    <p>The blast could be heard for kilo­me­tres and was felt at least nine blocks away, knock­ing one of­fi­cer off his feet, Mr Aaron said.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said the Pres­i­dent had been briefed on the ex­plo­sion and was “grate­ful for the in­cred­i­ble first re­spon­ders and pray­ing for those who were in­jured”.</p>
    <p>The ve­hi­cle ex­ploded just out­side the Melt­ing Pot, a fon­due restaurant in a down­town build­ing that was erected in the late 19th cen­tury. Win­dows on ei­ther end of the build­ing were blown out, as were the large, heavy doors at the build­ing’s en­trance. The ex­plo­sion also trig­gered the sprin­kler sys­tem, which flooded the restaurant for about eight hours.</p>
    <p>“It’s a mess,” said Mr Mark Rosen­thal, one of the restaurant’s own­ers. “We have about 115 peo­ple work­ing there, but that’s 115 peo­ple that now don’t have jobs. So that’s rough to think about.”</p>
    <p>Mr Fred­die O’Con­nell, a city coun­cil­man who rep­re­sents the af­fected area, said dozens of peo­ple had been dis­placed and were taken to a triage area, where they could be checked for in­juries and stay warm on a bit­terly cold morn­ing.</p>
    <p>“2020 al­ready had plenty of dev­as­ta­tion,” Mr O’Con­nell said. “It’s hard to wake up on Christ­mas morn­ing and see more of it in my home town.”</p>
