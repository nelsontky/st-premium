    <p>• It has been more than 22 years since Venus and Ser­ena Wil­liams first played each other on the WTA Tour.</p>
    <p>They were teenagers then, with beads in their hair and braces on their teeth. Ten­nis great­ness was pre­dicted – and not just by Richard Wil­liams, their fa­ther and coach – and the sis­ters have de­liv­ered.</p>
    <p>But what is nearly as re­mark­able as their suc­cess is their longevity. On Thurs­day, they faced each other for the 31st time in a strange and new en­vi­ron­ment, with Ser­ena pre­vail­ing 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 in the sec­ond round of the in­au­gu­ral Top Seed Open.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of the coron­avirus pan­demic, no pay­ing spec­ta­tors were al­lowed and it looked, at first glance, more like a prac­tice match, the kind the sis­ters must have played so of­ten in pri­vate through the decades.</p>
    <p>But that was not the way Venus, 40, and Ser­ena, 38, saw it.</p>
    <p>Not only was it a far bet­ter match than their most re­cent meet­ing – a 6-1, 6-2 rout by Ser­ena in the third round of the 2018 US Open, for the world No. 9, Lex­ing­ton is also act­ing as a cru­cial tune-up for the US Open. This was her first event since Fe­bru­ary’s Fed Cup.</p>
    <p>With just one more warm-up tour­na­ment – the Western & South­ern Open, which starts on Thurs­day – be­fore the hard-court Grand Slam be­gins on Aug 31, she needs all the match prac­tice she can get.</p>
    <p>Ser­ena, who will be aim­ing for a record-ty­ing 24th Ma­jor at Flush­ing Mead­ows, said: “I wanted to win this for my game and my con­fi­dence. I hon­estly didn’t come here to win (a ti­tle) for the first time in my ca­reer. I just came here to get some matches. I haven’t had this much time off since I had the baby.”</p>

    <p>’’ SER­ENA WIL­LIAMS, world No. 9, on the coron­avirus-en­forced hia­tus this year. She gave birth to her daugh­ter in 2017.</p>
    <p>work­out in what was their ear­li­est meet­ing since their first Tour-level clash in the sec­ond round of the 1998 Aus­tralian Open.</p>
    <p>After im­prov­ing to 19-12 in headto-head matches, Ser­ena said of the 67th-ranked Venus: “This was right up there. I’d say it was one of the all-time top five su­per-com­pet­i­tive matches be­tween the two of us.</p>
    <p>“It’s still not like the prac­tice courts’ quiet, but it’s never easy, never easy.”</p>
