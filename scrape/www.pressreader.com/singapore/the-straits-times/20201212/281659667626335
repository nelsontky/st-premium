    <p>With the spec­tre of Dis­ease X loom­ing, Sin­ga­pore is mak­ing sure that di­ag­nos­tics, treat­ments and vac­cines will be ready fast when an­other cri­sis strikes, with a new bat­tle plan against fu­ture out­breaks.</p>
    <p>Un­der the new Pre­pare pro­gramme, the Repub­lic will work closely with other re­searchers in the re­gion to keep a close watch on pathogens cir­cu­lat­ing in an­i­mal pop­u­la­tions. If such viruses jump into hu­mans, they could cause a new, un­known dis­ease and seed an out­break.</p>
    <p>The idea of the pro­gramme is also to mar­shal the forces of sci­en­tists and trans­form dis­cov­er­ies into so­lu­tions – from pin­point­ing the source of an out­break to de­vel­op­ing the best drugs for pa­tients.</p>
    <p>“This pro­gramme will sup­port faster time­lines to pro­duce di­ag­nos­tics, faster time­lines to test and de­velop new ther­a­peu­tics, and faster time­lines to test and maybe to de­velop vac­cines,” the Health</p>
    <p>Ministry’s chief health sci­en­tist, Pro­fes­sor Tan Chorh Chuan, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The new na­tional re­search pro­gramme for epi­demic pre­pared­ness and re­sponse (Pre­pare) was an­nounced yes­ter­day as Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat launched the coun­try’s $25 bil­lion plan chart­ing the coun­try’s re­search land­scape over the next five years. Pre­pare will span five years, and will be helmed by the Ministry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>Prof Tan said the new pro­gramme is meant to be trans­la­tional in na­ture – which means ap­ply­ing sci­en­tific find­ings to re­al­world sit­u­a­tions – although fund­ing will still be avail­able for ba­sic re­search. “What this new pro­gramme would do would be to build the en­ablers in terms of data, tis­sue, pathogen ma­te­ri­als, as well as the net­works that are work­ing around in­fec­tious dis­eases or pub­lic health in­ter­ests,” he said.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, this could in­clude pro­vid­ing fund­ing to build more long-term, core in­fra­struc­ture such as those that would en­able the se­cure stor­age of data, or build­ing a “bank” where clin­i­cal and bi­o­log­i­cal sam­ples can be stored.</p>
    <p>He cited how pa­tient serum sam­ples from the 2003 out­break of se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome (Sars) had come in handy for re­searchers work­ing on a Covid-19 an­ti­body test. The pathogens that cause Sars and Covid-19 are from the same fam­ily – coro­n­aviruses.</p>
    <p>“We were able to use th­ese sam­ples to help us to val­i­date whether the test kits we were de­vel­op­ing had a cross-re­ac­tiv­ity against the 2003 Sars virus. So, those kinds of sam­ples can be very use­ful when we are deal­ing with cur­rent pathogens,” Prof Tan ex­plained.</p>
    <p>Es­tab­lish­ing net­works be­tween re­searchers from dif­fer­ent in­sti­tu­tions and dis­ci­plines is im­por­tant, he said. This could help foster col­lab­o­ra­tions be­tween dif­fer­ent groups of sci­en­tists in the ar­eas of di­ag­nos­tics, ther­a­peu­tics and vac­cines that would lead to bet­ter out­comes.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the devel­op­ment of a di­ag­nos­tic test re­quires re­searchers with ex­per­tise not just in bi­ol­ogy, but also mi­croflu­idics (a field of sci­ence in­volv­ing the ma­nip­u­la­tion of flu­ids on a small scale) and sen­sor sys­tems, he said.</p>
    <p>Pro­duc­ti­sa­tion is also an im­por­tant el­e­ment of bring­ing sci­en­tific re­search from bench to bed­side, said Prof Tan. Such trans­la­tional ac­tiv­ity will bet­ter meet the needs of Sin­ga­pore’s Health Ministry and other pub­lic health agencies in epi­demic con­trol.</p>
    <p>Prof Tan pointed out that the re­search com­mu­nity in Sin­ga­pore has con­trib­uted sig­nif­i­cantly to the pub­lic health re­sponse to Covid-19. How­ever, the pan­demic had also yielded learn­ing points, which is what the new re­search pro­gramme is de­signed to take in.</p>
    <p>“This will fur­ther strengthen our abil­ity to do R&D to help with fu­ture epi­demics and out­breaks.”</p>
