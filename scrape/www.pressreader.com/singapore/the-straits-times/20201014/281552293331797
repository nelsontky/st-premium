    <p>Elec­tric cars will be built at a highly au­to­mated fac­tory in Sin­ga­pore, mark­ing the re­turn of au­to­mo­bile man­u­fac­tur­ing here and in­cor­po­rat­ing first-of-its kind fea­tures.</p>
    <p>Elec­tric cars will be built at a highly au­to­mated fac­tory in Sin­ga­pore, mark­ing the re­turn of au­to­mo­bile man­u­fac­tur­ing here and in­cor­po­rat­ing first-of-its-kind fea­tures.</p>
    <p>At a vir­tual ground­break­ing cer­e­mony of the Hyundai Mo­tor Group In­no­va­tion Cen­tre in Jurong yesterday, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong noted that the in­vest­ment by the South Korean car­maker was a nod to Sin­ga­pore’s strengths.</p>
    <p>“I am happy that Hyundai has cho­sen Sin­ga­pore to lo­cate your new­est fa­cil­ity. It is an in­vest­ment of al­most $400 mil­lion, and may pro­duce up to 30,000 ve­hi­cles per year by 2025, five years from now,” said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre, to be com­pleted by end-2022, will serve as an open in­no­va­tion lab for re­search and devel­op­ment into mo­bil­ity con­cepts, which ob­servers reckon will in­clude au­ton­o­mous ve­hi­cles and new forms of ride-shar­ing.</p>
    <p>Sit­ting on a 44,000 sq m plot – larger than five foot­ball fields – in the Jurong In­no­va­tion Dis­trict, and with a built-up area of some 90,000 sq m, the fa­cil­ity will be fu­tur­is­tic.</p>
    <p>It will have a land­ing pad for pas­sen­ger drones – which Hyundai is also de­vel­op­ing – and em­ploy re­new­able en­ergy sources such as so­lar and hy­dro­gen.</p>
    <p>When ready, the fa­cil­ity will have a small-scale elec­tric car as­sem­bly line which is ex­pected to pro­duce up to 30,000 ve­hi­cles a year.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers will be able to pur­chase and cus­tomise their ve­hi­cles on their phones. Once an or­der is con­firmed, pro­duc­tion will be­gin.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers can then watch their cars be­ing as­sem­bled at the cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The fa­cil­ity will be a “vivid demon­stra­tion” that Sin­ga­pore has what it takes to dream big and rein­vent it­self, said PM Lee. “We did not think that Sin­ga­pore would one day be man­u­fac­tur­ing cars again. But Sin­ga­pore is where we have made the im­pos­si­ble, pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>He said Sin­ga­pore had a car as­sem­bly in­dus­try from as early as the 1940s, but aban­doned it in 1980 when com­mer­cial com­pet­i­tive­ness be­gan to favour high-vol­ume plants.</p>
    <p>But 40 years on, with the re­vival of elec­tric ve­hi­cles, the game has changed again with grow­ing in­ter­est in cleaner, smarter ve­hi­cles and cities fac­ing pres­sure to move peo­ple around in an en­vi­ron­men­tally sus­tain­able man­ner.</p>
    <p>Au­to­mo­tive ac­tiv­i­ties are be­com­ing vi­able in Sin­ga­pore again, he said. “Elec­tric ve­hi­cles have a dif­fer­ent sup­ply chain, fewer me­chan­i­cal parts and more elec­tron­ics, which plays to Sin­ga­pore’s strengths.”</p>
    <p>That is why global com­pa­nies pro­duc­ing au­to­mo­tive elec­tron­ics like Del­phi and In­fi­neon have been in Sin­ga­pore for some time, he added.</p>
    <p>This will hope­fully open up new growth ar­eas for the econ­omy, he said, and cre­ate ex­cit­ing jobs such as In­dus­trial In­ter­net of Things en­gi­neers, data sci­en­tists and dig­i­tal sup­ply chain strate­gists.</p>
    <p>Joined vir­tu­ally by South Korean Trade, In­dus­try and En­ergy Min­is­ter Sung Yun-mo and Hyundai Mo­tor Group ex­ec­u­tive vice-chair­man Chung Eui-sun at the event, Mr Lee added that the fa­cil­ity could pave the way for more South Korean com­pa­nies to in­vest here, part­ner with lo­cal busi­nesses and col­lab­o­rate with univer­si­ties and re­search in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>Hyundai said the fa­cil­ity will em­ploy var­i­ous ad­vanced man­u­fac­tur­ing and lo­gis­ti­cal sys­tems, in­clud­ing ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, In­ter­net of Things and ro­bot­ics.</p>
    <p>Hyundai will also trial bat­tery-asa-ser­vice, where con­sumers buy an elec­tric car with­out its bat­tery – which can ac­count for half its cost – and then lease the cells from Hyundai. This could re­duce the cost of an elec­tric ve­hi­cle dra­mat­i­cally.</p>
    <p>The com­pany would not re­veal the num­ber of peo­ple the fa­cil­ity will em­ploy, say­ing it “will be determined later... as the pro­ject evolves”. Ear­lier, a spokesman said it would cre­ate “hun­dreds of jobs”.</p>
    <p>Hyundai’s move comes af­ter a bid by Bri­tish home ap­pli­ance maker Dyson to make elec­tric cars in Sin­ga­pore. Dyson, how­ever, pulled the plug on the ven­ture.</p>
    <p>Hyundai elec­tric cars made in Sin­ga­pore will be for the lo­cal mar­ket ini­tially, with ex­port plans fur­ther down the road.</p>
    <p>A Hyundai spokesman said: “Prod­ucts built at the in­no­va­tion cen­tre will first be of­fered to cus­tomers in Sin­ga­pore. Hyundai Mo­tor Group will re­view ex­pan­sion plans to other mar­kets at a later stage.”</p>
    <p>With an an­nual ca­pac­ity of up to 30,000 cars, ob­servers reckon the fa­cil­ity will have to ex­port, as the Sin­ga­pore mar­ket is un­likely to be able to ab­sorb all the cars.</p>
    <p>Mr Teo Hock Seng, ex­ec­u­tive chair­man of Hyundai agent Ko­moco Hold­ings, is tar­get­ing to sell 5,000 to 6,000 of the elec­tric cars a year.</p>
    <p>The fig­ures are higher than Ko­moco’s av­er­age an­nual sales vol­ume since it started here 34 years ago.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that mod­els to be as­sem­bled here may in­clude the Ioniq 5, a mid­sized elec­tric cross­over based on the Hyundai Con­cept 45 to be launched in South Korea next year, and the yet-to-be-an­nounced Ioniq 3 elec­tric com­pact cross­over.</p>
    <p>Pro­duc­tion of the Ioniq 5 will start by the end of 2022, while the Ioniq 3 is ex­pected to be pro­duced by 2025.</p>
    <p>Mo­torists hop­ing for the Sin­ga­pore-made cars to be sig­nif­i­cantly cheaper than im­ported ones may be dis­ap­pointed.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try watch­ers said the Hyundai plant is an as­sem­bly fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>As such, it would have to im­port prac­ti­cally all the parts and com­po­nents which go into mak­ing the cars. All ve­hic­u­lar taxes will con­tinue to ap­ply.</p>
    <p>One pos­si­ble ad­van­tage, how­ever, is Hyundai’s bat­tery-as-a-ser­vice busi­ness model.</p>
    <p>The South Korean com­pany said it will ex­plore this con­cept, which al­lows con­sumers to buy a bat­tery­less elec­tric car, and then lease the cells from Hyundai.</p>
    <p>And since the bat­tery ac­counts for half or more of an elec­tric car’s cost, this con­cept may re­duce the pur­chase cost sub­stan­tially.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Hyundai said cus­tomers will be able to pur­chase and cus­tomise their ve­hi­cles on their phones. Once an or­der is con­firmed, pro­duc­tion will be­gin.</p>
    <p>Hyundai is part­ner­ing Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity to, among other things, find ways to fa­cil­i­tate “smart cus­tomis­ing” func­tions which would al­low cus­tomers to tai­lor-make their cars.</p>
    <p>Hyundai said: “Once the car is ready for de­liv­ery, it will be trans­ferred to a 620m Sky Track where the cus­tomer can test-drive the ve­hi­cle.”</p>
    <p>The Sky Track will sit atop the seven-storey fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>Hyundai said it will em­ploy var­i­ous ad­vanced man­u­fac­tur­ing and lo­gis­ti­cal sys­tems, in­clud­ing ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, In­ter­net of Things and ro­bot­ics. These will re­sult in a “highly au­to­mated... safe and ef­fi­cient work en­vi­ron­ment”.</p>
