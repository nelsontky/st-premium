    <p>Based on the DC comics of the same name, tele­vi­sion se­ries Doom</p>
    <p>Pa­trol is about a band of su­per-pow­ered mis­fits try­ing to save the world. Fans and crit­ics say that the wacky show, which also dives into weighty themes such as men­tal ill­ness and trauma, might be the strangest su­per­hero se­ries ever made.</p>
    <p>Doom Pa­trol might be the strangest su­per­hero se­ries ever made, say fans and crit­ics. But that has only made them love the wacky show – about a band of su­per­pow­ered mis­fits try­ing to save the world – even more.</p>
    <p>Based on the DC comics of the same name, it is crammed with weird mo­ments.</p>
    <p>Some of the odder ones in­clude send­ing its su­per­heroes into an alternate di­men­sion via the throat of a fart­ing don­key; an en­counter with an army of car­niv­o­rous, tor­so­less rear ends; and a stom­achchurn­ing scene in­volv­ing the con­sump­tion of fa­cial hair.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the show dives into weighty themes such as men­tal ill­ness and trauma. Its ec­cen­tric hu­mour and ir­rev­er­ence make it the per­fect ad­di­tion to a genre that has taken it­self far too se­ri­ously.</p>
    <p>So says ac­tress Diane Guer­rero, who plays Jane, a woman with 64 dif­fer­ent per­son­al­i­ties, each with its own pow­ers.</p>
    <p>“I think we’ve all taken our­selves too se­ri­ously, and cer­tainly the su­per­hero genre has,” says the 33-year-old.</p>
    <p>“I think that’s why peo­ple are ex­cited for Doom Pa­trol – be­cause it’s not like any­thing we’ve seen su­per­heroes do.</p>
    <p>“Su­per­heroes are of­ten seen as squeaky clean and per­fect, but peo­ple en­joy see­ing their hu­man side. They like see­ing them work on their per­sonal is­sues.</p>
    <p>“And just be­cause you have these pow­ers doesn’t mean you don’t have men­tal health is­sues you also have to work on.”</p>
    <p>The ac­tress jumped on a video call with The Straits Times and other press to talk about the show, which launched last year and co-stars Matt Bomer (Magic Mike, 2012) and Ti­mothy Dal­ton (Li­cence To Kill, 1989).</p>
    <p>Both sea­sons de­buted re­cently on HBO Go, with a new episode of the sec­ond sea­son re­leased every Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Asked how she plays a char­ac­ter with so many iden­ti­ties, Guer­rero chuck­les.</p>
    <p>“Well, if you speak to my mother, she’ll say I’m very sim­i­lar – although maybe not with 64 per­son­al­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>To re­search the role, the per­former read as much as she could on dis­so­cia­tive iden­tity dis­or­der.</p>
    <p>And she per­son­ally iden­ti­fied with Jane’s psy­cho­log­i­cal chal­lenges “be­cause I’ve grap­pled with de­pres­sion and men­tal health is­sues my­self”, she re­veals.</p>
    <p>“Trauma and men­tal health is­sues have al­ways been a part of my work (as an ac­tress), so when this char­ac­ter came my way, I thought this was some­thing I wanted to ex­plore.</p>
    <p>“It also helped clear up a lot of things for me per­son­ally, which was very help­ful,” she said.</p>
    <p>Guer­rero, who starred i n the ac­claimed prison com­edy-drama Orange Is The New Black (2013 to last year), says Doom Pa­trol fills a gap when it comes to the por­trayal of men­tal health on screen.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think we talk about men­tal health as much as we should. I don’t think we re­ally show how much it tor­ments peo­ple and can be de­bil­i­tat­ing. I haven’t seen that on any other show, es­pe­cially one that can reach such a wide au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>“We don’t see the kind of work it re­ally takes in or­der for us to be on that heal­ing jour­ney,” says the ac­tress, who was prompted to restart psy­chother­apy ses­sions her­self while work­ing on the sec­ond sea­son.</p>
    <p>“What you mostly see is peo­ple who are un­well – and then they’re well. What I like about Doom Pa­trol is it does a good job of show­ing you the re­al­ity of that – be­cause it takes years of on­go­ing work (to heal) and that’s not rep­re­sented in any other show as much as this.”</p>
    <p>The se­ries also of­fers a big­ger les­son on com­pas­sion, she says.</p>
    <p>“What the show has taught me is that there is a lot more to peo­ple – a lot more story and a lot more his­tory. It’s taught me that I should think about that when I meet folks and don’t click with them or un­der­stand them.”</p>
    <p>When that hap­pens, “it’s prob­a­bly be­cause they have a lot more go­ing on than you think”, Guer­rero be­lieves. “And our char­ac­ters help open up that world. If some­one maybe seems strange or an­gry or sad, it’s prob­a­bly be­cause some­thing trau­matic or life-chang­ing event has made them that way.</p>
    <p>“So it taught me to look deeper into a per­son and maybe not dis­miss them right away.”</p>
    <p>Both sea­sons of Doom Pa­trol de­buted re­cently on HBO Go, with a new episode of the sec­ond sea­son re­leased every Fri­day.</p>
