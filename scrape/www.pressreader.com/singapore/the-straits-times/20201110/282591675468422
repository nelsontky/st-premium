    <p>Hav­ing spent the bet­ter part of my 20s stay­ing in back­packer hos­tels to stretch my dol­lar, I am de­lighted to find that ST Sig­na­ture Jalan Be­sar, which opened in May, has given com­mu­nal liv­ing a leg-up.</p>
    <p>At the co-liv­ing ho­tel, guests share a kitchen, lounge and pub­lic spa­ces such as a meet­ing room, out­door pa­tio and var­i­ous nooks and cran­nies where they can curl up with a book or a cup of tea.</p>
    <p>Some rooms come with en-suite toi­lets, while oth­ers share a com­mu­nal, uni­sex bath­room and show­ers.</p>
    <p>No dingy, hair-sod­den floors here – the bath­room’s dec­o­ra­tive lamps, Per­anakan tiles, warm light­ing and pan­elled mir­rors make it one of the ho­tel’s most In­sta­grammable spots. There are even Dyson hairdry­ers to boot.</p>
    <p>So it’s cheap, but is it com­fort­able?</p>
    <p>Loft liv­ing is a de­light­ful con­cept and my Cabin M Dou­ble En­suite with no win­dow is com­pact yet cosy. The lower level fits a writ­ing desk, open-con­cept wardrobe and a spa­cious bath­room with a rain shower.</p>
    <p>Steep stairs lead to a queen-size bed be­decked with four pil­lows and a plush quilt.</p>
    <p>Se­nior op­er­a­tions man­ager Ng Xin Fang says mat­tresses are firm on one side and soft on the other, and can be flipped at guests’ re­quest. In line with Asian pref­er­ences, the de­fault set­ting is the firm one, which is just nice for me.</p>
    <p>A smart TV at the foot of the bed comes with Net­flix, Ama­zon Prime and Spo­tify, though guests must log in with their own ac­counts.</p>
    <p>When you are over­seas, it feels like a waste of pre­cious va­ca­tion time to re­watch episodes of Friends. Here, I hun­ker un­der the cov­ers and let the ban­ter of Phoebe, Joey, Rachel, Ross, Monica and Chan­dler lull me to sleep.</p>
    <p>What else is there to do?</p>
    <p>Like a re­sort, the ho­tel runs in-house ac­tiv­i­ties so you do not have to schlep out of its premises for the du­ra­tion of your stay.</p>
    <p>I rouse early for a yoga class at the ho­tel’s open-air pa­tio, run by in­struc­tor Lynette Ng, who is also the owner of Sweat­box Yoga.</p>
    <p>A class costs be­tween $20 and $30, de­pend­ing on the num­ber of stu­dents – about the same as dropin rates at bou­tique studios in town.</p>
    <p>I also join a clay work­shop by so­cial en­ter­prise Tin­kle Arts, which col­lab­o­rates with the Move­ment for the In­tel­lec­tu­ally Dis­abled of Sin­ga­pore and em­ploys staff with spe­cial needs.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the hour-long ses­sion, founder Charlene Chan walks us through craft­ing a mini kueh plat­ter, where we shape clay into on­deh on­deh and kueh cara (pan­dan sponge cake).</p>
    <p>De­spite my but­ter fin­gers, it is a fun and for­giv­ing process. Squished a piece too flat? Just pop it back into the mould for an­other go. Mis­shapen kueh? Tuck it be­hind the oth­ers when glu­ing them down.</p>
    <p>The re­sult is a del­i­cate, cute-as-abut­ton dec­o­ra­tive plat­ter that makes us all hun­gry by the time we are done. Work­shops start at $50, de­pend­ing on the ma­te­ri­als re­quired.</p>
    <p>You’ve saved on a stay, now in­dulge in a good meal</p>
    <p>Head to Side­ways, a five-minute walk away in Row­ell Road, for sour­dough bread and piz­zas baked in a wood-fired oven. Pair the food with pi­quant dips such as av­o­cado pesto ($12), a re­fresh­ing blend that in­cludes basil, mint, parmi­giano and feta cheese.</p>
    <p>Or or­der up a storm at any of the dim sum joints nearby, in­clud­ing sup­per in­sti­tu­tion Swee Choon along Jalan Be­sar, known for its crispy mee sua kueh.</p>
    <p>Other wor­thy con­tenders in­clude Sum Dim Sum and Dim Sum Haus – the lat­ter is just round the cor­ner from the ho­tel.</p>
    <p>Ver­dict: Hid­den gem or bud­get disas­ter?</p>
    <p>Def­i­nitely a hid­den gem. From read­ing nooks to co-work­ing desks, the youth­ful ho­tel brims with per­son­al­ity.</p>
    <p>Net­flix in bed is a treat, es­pe­cially at this price point.</p>
    <p>If you are the bar-hop­ping sort, look out for ST Sig­na­ture’s other branches in Chi­na­town and Tan­jong Pa­gar, which will re­open soon.</p>
