    <p>A new se­ries of con­ver­sa­tions aimed at young fam­i­lies will look at whether work­ing from home – which be­came the norm dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic – should be here to stay.</p>
    <p>The aim is to bet­ter sup­port fam­i­lies and en­cour­age par­ent­hood, as the Govern­ment recog­nises that the past year had been tough for young cou­ples go­ing through the pan­demic, with some de­fer­ring mar­riage plans and oth­ers putting off hav­ing chil­dren.</p>
    <p>The con­ver­sa­tions are ex­pected to start af­ter the first quar­ter of the year and will likely be held vir­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>A new se­ries of con­ver­sa­tions aimed at young fam­i­lies will ex­plore whether work­ing from home, which be­came the norm dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, should be here to stay.</p>
    <p>An­nounc­ing the plan for the con­ver­sa­tions yes­ter­day, Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice Indranee Ra­jah said that the past year had been tough for young cou­ples, with some de­fer­ring mar­riage plans and oth­ers putting off hav­ing chil­dren, and the Govern­ment wants to hear from them about their post­pan­demic hopes and needs.</p>
    <p>Ms Indranee, who over­sees the Na­tional Pop­u­la­tion and Tal­ent Divi­sion, said the ul­ti­mate aim is to bet­ter sup­port fam­i­lies, to en­cour­age par­ent­hood.</p>
    <p>One thing she hopes the con­ver­sa­tions will shed light on is how fam­i­lies feel about work­ing from home, which was forced upon the world by the pan­demic. She noted that some cou­ples ap­pre­ci­ate the flex­i­bil­ity it brings, while there are also those who find it stress­ful.</p>
    <p>“Prior to Covid, many em­ploy­ers, and many em­ploy­ees as well, felt work­ing from home was dif­fi­cult to do,” Ms Indranee said.</p>
    <p>“But... many com­pa­nies have adapted, many peo­ple have also adapted, and what was pre­vi­ously thought not pos­si­ble has been found to be pos­si­ble. What is very clear is it can be done. Even if we get vac­ci­na­tion and come back to a new nor­mal, I don’t think (work­ing from home) will go away.”</p>
    <p>She en­vi­sions that flex­i­ble work­ing ar­range­ments may be­come part of how Sin­ga­pore sup­ports young fam­i­lies. She hopes to also learn more about the con­cerns and as­pi­ra­tions of young fam­i­lies through the con­ver­sa­tions, so that the Govern­ment can look at what pol­icy ad­just­ments or ini­tia­tives are needed.</p>
    <p>“You want fam­i­lies to be happy to grow, but you can only do that if they have the right sup­port and if we know what that sup­port is,” she said at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence held af­ter a visit to KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>The new con­ver­sa­tion se­ries, which comes amid other en­gage­ment ef­forts such as the Emerg­ing Stronger Con­ver­sa­tions and the Con­ver­sa­tions on Women De­vel­op­ment, will fo­cus on young fam­i­lies – from those who are just mar­ried to those with pri­mary school-age chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Ms Indranee said she hopes to hear from a broad spec­trum, from sin­gle-par­ent fam­i­lies to those that have to care for young chil­dren as well as elderly par­ents.</p>
    <p>She also aims to cover as many fam­i­lies as pos­si­ble, from as wide a ge­o­graph­i­cal area as pos­si­ble, and said de­tails on the specifics of the con­ver­sa­tion se­ries will be ironed out in the months ahead.</p>
    <p>It is ex­pected to be­gin af­ter the first quar­ter of the year and will likely be held vir­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>ADAPT­ING TO NEW NORM</p>
    <p>Prior to Covid, many em­ploy­ers, and many em­ploy­ees as well, felt work­ing from home was dif­fi­cult to do... But... many com­pa­nies have adapted, many peo­ple have also adapted, and what was pre­vi­ously thought not pos­si­ble has been found to be pos­si­ble. What is very clear is it can be done. Even if we get vac­ci­na­tion and come back to a new nor­mal, I don’t think (work­ing from home) will go away.</p>
