    <p>NEW YORK • Wal­mart re­moved firearms and am­mu­ni­tion from US store floors this week to pro­tect cus­tomers and em­ploy­ees as ten­sions across the coun­try have been ris­ing, said the world’s largest re­tailer.</p>
    <p>The move comes days be­fore the United States pres­i­den­tial elec­tion on Nov 3, with many wor­ried that the polling re­sult could be con­tested or spark vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>“We have seen some iso­lated civil un­rest and as we have done on sev­eral oc­ca­sions over the last few years, we have moved our firearms and am­mu­ni­tion off the sales floor as a pre­cau­tion for the safety of our as­so­ciates and cus­tomers,” a Wal­mart spokesman said on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The com­pany does not have a date for when it will place the guns and am­mu­ni­tion back on the shelves, he added.</p>
    <p>The Arkansas-based re­tailer, which sells firearms in ap­prox­i­mately half of its more than 5,000 US stores, will still sell the items upon re­quest, it said.</p>
    <p>Re­tail­ers have been on edge af­ter raiders ear­lier this year smashed win­dows, stole mer­chan­dise and, at times, set stores ablaze in Chicago, New York, Los An­ge­les, Port­land and other US cities.</p>
    <p>In an­other trend that has fed con­cerns, gun sales in the US this year have reached record highs.</p>
    <p>More first-time buy­ers have also pur­chased firearms in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>In June, Wal­mart pulled firearms and am­mu­ni­tion from some US stores amid na­tion­wide protests over the death of un­armed black man Ge­orge Floyd at the hands of po­lice in late May.</p>

At&#xAD;ten&#xAD;dees re&#xAD;mained in or near their cars to avoid the pos&#xAD;si&#xAD;ble spread of Covid-19. They were also re&#xAD;quired to wear masks, but they did not al&#xAD;ways main&#xAD;tain so&#xAD;cial dis&#xAD;tanc&#xAD;ing.</p>
