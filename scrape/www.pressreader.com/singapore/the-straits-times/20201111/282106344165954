    <p>The Parti Liyani case, in­volv­ing the for­mer do­mes­tic worker of for­mer Changi Air­port Group chair­man Liew Mun Leong, has gen­er­ated much at­ten­tion and con­cern among Sin­ga­pore­ans, and un­der­stand­ably so, said Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong yes­ter­day, in his first pub­lic com­ments on the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>He also said that if there are any short­com­ings found in Sin­ga­pore’s crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem, they must be reme­died.</p>
    <p>“Build­ing a demo­cratic so­ci­ety based on jus­tice and equal­ity is a fun­da­men­tal goal of our na­tion. To do this, we need proper and fair en­force­ment of our laws,” he added in a Face­book post.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tin­u­ally strive to pro­tect and im­prove our jus­tice sys­tem, so that peo­ple can be as­sured that it is clean, just and works equally for all.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee’s com­ments came af­ter the mat­ter was de­bated in Par­lia­ment last Wed­nes­day in a marathon nine-hour ses­sion.</p>
    <p>The House heard from Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam who de­liv­ered a min­is­te­rial state­ment on Ms Parti’s case, and also de­bated a mo­tion put for­ward by Work­ers’ Party chair­man Sylvia Lim on im­prov­ing the crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem.</p>
    <p>On the ses­sion, PM Lee said the min­is­te­rial state­ment had com­pre­hen­sively put for­ward the facts of the case, adding: “Both sides of the House agreed that it had been treated as a rou­tine case by the po­lice and the AGC (At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Chambers), and that there was no at­tempt by any party to in­flu­ence its out­come.”</p>
    <p>Ms Parti was ac­cused of theft in 2016 by her then em­ployer, Mr Liew, and was con­victed by the State Courts last year.</p>
    <p>She was ac­quit­ted this year by the High Court on ap­peal, spark­ing a pub­lic out­cry among some, who asked why she was charged in the first place and whether Mr Liew had ex­erted any im­proper in­flu­ence on the case.</p>
    <p>Mr Liew is a prom­i­nent busi­ness­man who was also on the boards of gov­ern­ment-linked en­ti­ties such as in­fra­struc­ture con­sul­tancy Sur­bana Jurong and Te­masek Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>He re­signed from these po­si­tions fol­low­ing the pub­lic out­cry.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam dis­closed in Par­lia­ment that the in­ter­nal re­views by the po­lice and the AGC had found lapses in how they han­dled the case, but also con­firmed that there was no im­proper in­flu­ence at any point.</p>
    <p>He said there was no sign that Mr</p>
    <p>Liew or any­one from his fam­ily had lob­bied or ex­erted pres­sure on the po­lice, deputy pub­lic prose­cu­tors or trial judge over the case.</p>
    <p>In fact, it was the in­ves­ti­ga­tion of­fi­cer and his im­me­di­ate su­per­vi­sor, and the deputy pub­lic prose­cu­tors and their di­rec­tors who han­dled the case, as is typ­i­cal of such cases, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam re­it­er­ated this yes­ter­day in a Face­book post which PM Lee shared: “The facts showed that the po­lice and AGC had strong grounds to charge her, and no one at­tempted to ex­ert any in­flu­ence.”</p>
    <p>In the post, Mr Shan­mugam also linked video clips of the key points of his speech, in­clud­ing his crit­i­cism about the “cav­a­lier at­ti­tude” of the Liews, par­tic­u­larly Mr Liew’s son Karl, who has since been charged with per­jury in court and fur­nish­ing false in­for­ma­tion to the po­lice.</p>
    <p>He added in the post that the High Court’s de­ci­sion to over­turn Ms Parti’s con­vic­tion is fi­nal.</p>
    <p>“This case il­lus­trates how the rule of law is ap­plied in Sin­ga­pore,” he said.</p>
