    <p>The ex­pec­ta­tions are sky-high for the Sonos Arc.</p>
    <p>Not only is it the first Dolby At­mos sound­bar from the ac­claimed au­dio brand, but the Arc also runs on the new S2 soft­ware plat­form, which of­fers in­creased au­dio band­width for high-res­o­lu­tion au­dio and Dolby At­mos, as well as new fea­tures and ser­vices.</p>
    <p>I am glad to say it blows away my cur­rent Sonos Beam sound­bar in terms of depth and sound­stage.</p>
    <p>At al­most twice as long as the Beam and with 11 Class-D am­pli­fiers to the Beam’s five, the Arc, un­sur­pris­ingly, of­fers a much wider sound­stage.</p>
    <p>With my eyes closed, the im­me­di­acy of the Arc’s sound al­most con­vinces me that mu­si­cians are play­ing live in front of me.</p>
    <p>The sound is also bright and dy­namic, with punchy bass – though not quite as good as a home theatre sys­tem with a stand­alone sub­woofer.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, the Arc has two up­fir­ing driv­ers to add a di­men­sion of height to the au­dio for its Dolby At­mos fea­tures.</p>
    <p>But there is a ma­jor caveat. To get the most out of the Arc, it re­quires a Dolby At­mos-com­pat­i­ble tele­vi­sion with video stream­ing apps that sup­port Dolby At­mos, such as Ap­ple TV+ and Net­flix, and al­low Dolby At­mos passthroug­h – from a 4K Blu-ray player, for in­stance – to the sound­bar.</p>
    <p>In short, you will need a pre­mium TV made in the past two to three years. In fact, this re­view took longer than usual be­cause I had to bor­row a com­pat­i­ble TV.</p>
    <p>Build-wise, the Arc is im­pec­ca­ble, with a sturdy matt plas­tic body in black or white. It can be wall­mounted ($119 for the mount­ing kit). There are touch-sen­si­tive but­tons at the top and an LED in­di­ca­tor in front above the Sonos logo. A built-in far-field mi­cro­phone ar­ray lis­tens for voice cues to ac­ti­vate either Ama­zon Alexa or Google As­sis­tant.</p>
    <p>At the back of the Arc is its HDMI port, which sup­ports the en­hanced Au­dio Re­turn Chan­nel (eARC) func­tion­al­ity, and an Eth­er­net port. Older TVs with no ARC or eARC HDMI port can use the in­cluded op­ti­cal adapter with the TV’s op­ti­cal au­dio port to send au­dio to the sound­bar.</p>
    <p>Wi-Fi (2.4GHz only) is sup­ported, but not Blue­tooth. Ap­ple AirPlay 2 and Spo­tify Con­nect both let users stream mu­sic wire­lessly from other de­vices to the sound­bar.</p>
    <p>The Sonos S2 app (avail­able for An­droid and iOS) is used to con­trol the Arc and ad­just its set­tings.</p>
    <p>My most-used set­ting is the Speech En­hance­ment fea­ture, which makes di­a­logue sound clearer. The Night Sound mode re­duces the vol­ume late at night, while there are also some ba­sic equaliser set­tings for the tre­ble and bass lev­els.</p>
    <p>The app also shows the Dolby At­mos logo when the Arc is play­ing Dolby At­mos con­tent. I had to rely on this be­cause the Dolby At­mos ef­fect is un­der­whelm­ing in Net­flix.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, in the open­ing car chase scene from the ac­tion movie 6 Un­der­ground (2019), there was some ver­ti­cal­ity in the au­dio from the whirling blades of the po­lice he­li­copter, but the ef­fect was not dis­tinct enough.</p>
    <p>The At­mos ef­fects were more im­pres­sive in a 4K Blu-ray movie such as Blade Run­ner 2049 (2017). In the scrap­yard scene with pro­tag­o­nist K’s fly­ing car com­ing un­der at­tack in the rain, I could clearly dis­cern the di­rec­tion of the gun­fire, the rain pelt­ing down on the car’s wind­screen and the di­a­logue be­tween K and Joi.</p>
    <p>The qui­eter mo­ments i n the movie also showed off the Arc’s crisp, clean sound. I could clearly make out the crunch of boots on gravel and the tin­kle from a splash of whiskey.</p>
    <p>But the sound­bar may not be for ev­ery­one. Since its l aunch last month, some Arc users have com­plained about the muddy bass while play­ing bass-heavy con­tent at high vol­umes.</p>
    <p>A soft­ware up­date was re­cently re­leased to ad­dress this is­sue. But in my test – which was af­ter the up­date – the bass still sounded un­sta­ble at cer­tain low fre­quen­cies.</p>
    <p>To be fair, I could not dis­cern any prob­lem with the bass while us­ing the Arc for movies and mu­sic.</p>
    <p>This is prob­a­bly be­cause I am not close to max­ing out the Arc’s vol­ume, as it is very loud even at the half­way mark.</p>
    <p>At $1,499, the Arc is one of the more ex­pen­sive sound­bars in the mar­ket. Adding a Sonos Sub sub­woofer ($1,149) will def­i­nitely im­prove the bass, but at a price.</p>
