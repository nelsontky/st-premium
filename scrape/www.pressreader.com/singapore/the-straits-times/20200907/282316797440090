    <p>AT­LANTA • Even if Im Sung-jae fails to l and the sea­son-end­ing Tour Cham­pi­onship and his sec­ond PGA Tour ti­tle, that will not stop him from think­ing about the po­ten­tial US$15 mil­lion (S$20.5 mil­lion) wind­fall.</p>
    <p>In fact, the South Korean has al­ready started mak­ing plans on how to spend it.</p>
    <p>The world No. 27 se­cured his first PGA win at the Honda Clas­sic and fin­ished third at the Arnold Palmer In­vi­ta­tional in March be­fore the three-month Covid-19 stop­page.</p>
    <p>While he has not been fir­ing on all cylin­ders since golf re­sumed, Im has re­turned to form at East Lake, roar­ing into con­tention af­ter shoot­ing a six-un­der 64 in the sec­ond round on Sat­ur­day to sit at 12 un­der over­all in sec­ond place, one stroke be­hind leader and top-ranked Dustin John­son (70).</p>
    <p>The win­ner from this week’s elite 30-player field will be crowned the FedEx­Cup cham­pion and take home the US$15 mil­lion prize.</p>
    <p>On the life-chang­ing sum, the 22-year-old, bid­ding to be the sec­ond-youngest FedEx­Cup win­ner af­ter Jor­dan Spi­eth in 2015, said: “I’m aware of the US$15 mil­lion on the line, but I try not to think about it when I play.</p>
    <p>“It all seems like a dream. Just think­ing about it now makes me pretty happy... I would buy a house in the United States and save so that I can live a com­fort­able life in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“I hon­estly wasn’t feel­ing con­fi­dent the last few weeks. I feel like it’s all com­ing back to me now.</p>
    <p>“I haven’t been swing­ing... like I’ve been want­ing to... start­ing last week though, my swing started to feel a lot bet­ter and I was hit­ting the ball sim­i­lar to how I was be­fore the quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>“That al­lowed me to play with more free­dom and con­sis­tency.”</p>
    <p>Im will have to play even bet­ter if he is to put some dis­tance be­tween him­self and the chas­ing pack.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can Xan­der Schauf­fele is third on 11 un­der af­ter a 65, while com­pa­triot and third-ranked Justin Thomas (71) is fourth on 10 un­der.</p>
