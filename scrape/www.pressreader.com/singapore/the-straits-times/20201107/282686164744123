    <p>Sin­ga­pore stocks eased yes­ter­day af­ter tor­rid gains dur­ing the pre­vi­ous trad­ing ses­sion, de­spite strong ad­vances in key global in­dexes.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, mar­ket sen­ti­ment was broadly pos­i­tive i n Asia. Ja­pan’s Nikkei 225 in­dex ended yes­ter­day 0.91 per cent higher at 24,325.23, its high­est level since 1991. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng In­dex and South Korea’s Kospi also ended the trad­ing ses­sion with gains of 0.07 per cent and 0.11 per cent re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Bench­mark in­dexes for the neigh­bour­ing mar­kets of Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok were up by big­ger mar­gins of 1.43 per cent, 1.21 per cent and 0.48 per cent re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Against this back­drop, the Straits Times In­dex’s (STI) de­cline of 9.94 points, or 0.38 per cent, to 2,578.68 seemed rather dis­ap­point­ing.</p>
    <p>Sen­ti­ment across the broader mar­ket was soft too, with ad­vancers lag­ging de­clin­ers 185 to 226.</p>
    <p>The big­gest gain­ers within the STI were the rel­a­tively illiq­uid Jar­dine Cy­cle & Car­riage and Dairy Farm In­ter­na­tional, which ended yes­ter­day 4.33 per cent and 4.08 per cent higher re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore was in a dis­tant third place, with a gain of just 0.74 per cent.</p>
    <p>De­spite fall­ing back yes­ter­day, the STI is still up 154.84 points, or 6.39 per cent, for the week.</p>
    <p>Maple­tree In­dus­trial Trust, which was the big­gest de­cliner within the STI yes­ter­day, slip­ping 2.74 per cent lower, is ac­tu­ally still more than 4.9 per cent higher than a week ago.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, Sing­tel de­clined 1.83 per cent yes­ter­day, mak­ing it the sec­ond-worst per­former within the STI; but it is still more than 5.9 per cent higher than last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The three lo­cal banks, which ac­count for more than one-third of the STI, also had a good week.</p>
    <p>DBS Bank was up more than 10.5 per cent ver­sus last Fri­day, while OCBC Bank and United Over­seas Bank were up nearly 6.1 per cent and 7.7 per cent re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>• Lo­cal banks, ac­count­ing for over a third of STI, have good week too</p>
