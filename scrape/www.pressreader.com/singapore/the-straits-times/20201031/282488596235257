    <p>About 89,000 peo­ple have re­ceived the Covid-19 Sup­port Grant, which pro­vides up to $800 a month for three months to Sin­ga­porean and per­ma­nent res­i­dent work­ers who have lost their jobs, been placed on in­vol­un­tary no-pay leave or have sus­tained sig­nif­i­cant salary loss be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, Min­is­ter for So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli said that among the group, 10,000 re­ceived the first tranche and have suc­cess­fully ap­plied for a sec­ond round of the grant, which will also last three months.</p>
    <p>“Some of us are still feel­ing the ef­fects Covid-19 has brought to our econ­omy, and need a leg-up to pro­vide for your­self and your fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“The Govern­ment is com­mit­ted to help­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans through this pan­demic, with the Covid-19 Sup­port Grant among sev­eral govern­ment as­sis­tance schemes,” said Mr Masa­gos.</p>
    <p>As at Sept 27, about $148 mil­lion had been dis­bursed through the grant. The ap­pli­ca­tion dead­line for the grant, which cov­ers both ful­land part-time em­ploy­ees, is Dec 31 and ap­pli­ca­tions can be made on­line on the SingPass plat­form.</p>
    <p>Mr Masa­gos said those who re­ceived the grant and need more aid can ap­ply again if they meet the re­vised el­i­gi­bil­ity cri­te­ria.</p>
    <p>The cri­te­ria were re­fined to bet­ter di­rect sup­port to those with less means, and the changes took ef­fect on Oct 1. Ap­pli­cants should not own more than one prop­erty and un­em­ployed ap­pli­cants must also pro­vide sup­port­ing doc­u­ments of job search or train­ing ef­forts.</p>
