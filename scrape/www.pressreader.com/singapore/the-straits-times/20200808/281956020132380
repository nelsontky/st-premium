    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power’s de­ci­sion to place 47 em­ploy­ers on a watch list, in ad­di­tion to 1,200 placed on it ear­lier, sug­gests that the fair hir­ing mes­sage is not get­ting through to many com­pa­nies. Er­rant em­ploy­ers must un­der­stand that they are up against the weight of both pub­lic and of­fi­cial opin­ion. There are con­cerns among lo­cal job seek­ers that they are not get­ting a fair deal in a tough job mar­ket, and that some em­ploy­ers ap­pear bi­ased against Sin­ga­pore­ans. This is ex­actly the kind of sit­u­a­tion that the Fair Con­sid­er­a­tion Frame­work watch list seeks to cor­rect by putting bosses on no­tice that they are un­der the min­istry’s scru­tiny so that they do not take ad­van­tage of Sin­ga­pore’s flex­i­ble labour mar­ket poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Not all em­ploy­ers who choose for­eign­ers over lo­cals may be mak­ing a de­lib­er­ate de­ci­sion. Some are not fa­mil­iar with the skill set of job seek­ers and with of­fi­cial sup­port mea­sures to help lo­cal work­ers reskill and up­skill. Some firms say they are un­able to find lo­cals with the nec­es­sary soft skills, spe­cial­ist ex­per­tise or ex­pe­ri­ence, when the truth is that they may not have cast their net wide enough, in­clud­ing by tap­ping pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­grammes. This scheme and labour poli­cies have a pur­pose that is tai­lored to the needs of em­ploy­ers and em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties recog­nise that com­pa­nies will aim to hire the best per­son for a job and, if it is a for­eigner, the firm’s choice must be re­spected be­cause it will con­trib­ute to its com­pet­i­tive­ness. But com­pa­nies’ hir­ing prac­tices be­come ques­tion­able when they also pick em­ploy­ees who are of a sin­gle for­eign na­tion­al­ity – and when this group is sig­nif­i­cantly big­ger com­pared with their in­dus­try peers. The vi­a­bil­ity of com­pa­nies makes it pos­si­ble for them to hire Sin­ga­pore­ans. For­eign em­ploy­ees should, of course, be on board to sup­ple­ment and com­ple­ment them – but not sup­plant them.</p>
    <p>It can­not be the case that some firms de­velop a re­flex in which hir­ing for­eign­ers is the easy op­tion. They must pay due heed to the avail­able pool of lo­cal hires, whose in­ter­ests have been ad­vanced through pro­grammes de­signed to place them on a level play­ing field where they can com­pete fairly with for­eign­ers. Such pro­grammes ex­ist to match the needs of work­ers and com­pa­nies here. Firms which ig­nore them de­serve cen­sure and penal­ties. Po­ten­tially dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices could lead to firms hav­ing their Em­ploy­ment Pass ap­pli­ca­tions for for­eign hires scru­ti­nised closely. Those who are re­cal­ci­trant or un­co­op­er­a­tive will have their work pass priv­i­leges cut back. Sin­ga­porean per­cep­tions of un­fair treat­ment are cause for con­cern even in the best of times, and more so in the cur­rent dif­fi­cult eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion. Com­pa­nies which owe their suc­cess to Sin­ga­pore’s as­tute po­lices, in­ter­na­tional con­nec­tiv­ity, le­gal cer­tainty and har­mo­nious labour prac­tices must play by the rules.</p>
