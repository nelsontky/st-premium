    <p>LEIPZIG • Judg­ing by Manch­ester United’s poor start on Tues­day, one might sur­mise that they were un­set­tled by Paul Pogba’s agent lead­ing up to their 3-2 de­feat at RB Leipzig and exit from the Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>But man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer re­fused to ad­mit his team were af­fected by the mid­fielder’s agent Mino Raiola claim­ing the French­man is “un­happy” at the club.</p>
    <p>United, who dropped to the Europa League, were pun­ished for con­ced­ing early goals by Manch­ester City l oa­nee An­gelino and Amadou Haidara be­fore Justin Kluiv­ert put Leipzig 3-0 up mid­way through the sec­ond half.</p>
    <p>The Red Dev­ils pulled back two goals in the fi­nal 10 min­utes as Pogba came on and con­trib­uted to an Ibrahima Konate own goal to make it 3-2 af­ter Bruno Fer­nan­des con­verted a penalty.</p>
    <p>In an ear­lier in­ter­view with an Ital­ian news­pa­per, Raiola said Pogba, 27, is in need of a “change of scene” af­ter strug­gling to es­tab­lish him­self in four sea­sons at the club.</p>
    <p>The United boss gave a terse re­ply when asked if Raiola’s com­ments had af­fected his side ahead of their game, in which they had needed only a point to ad­vance.</p>
    <p>“The squad is fine, they are a team and they stick to­gether. As soon as Paul’s agent re­alises it’s a team sport and we work to­gether, the bet­ter,” he said.</p>
    <p>“That is the last thing I want to say about it.”</p>
    <p>When asked if he had spo­ken to Pogba about Raiola’s com­ments, the Nor­we­gian added: “You have to ask Paul if he is happy or not.</p>
    <p>“I’m not go­ing to speak for him. Paul is fo­cused on do­ing his best for the team and when he’s here he’s work­ing hard in train­ing and just needs to fo­cus on his per­for­mances.”</p>
    <p>Raiola said the best so­lu­tion was for United to sell the French­man, whose con­tract ends in 2022, in Jan­uary’s trans­fer win­dow.</p>
    <p>Pogba, who re­joined from Ju­ven­tus in 2016, has started just half of United’s 10 Premier League matches this sea­son.</p>
    <p>Sol­sk­jaer in­stead blamed the loss on his side’s lethar­gic start.</p>
    <p>“We didn’t per­form well enough as a team,” he said. “We knew they would come at us and put crosses in the box and, un­for­tu­nately, we con­ceded two goals and never got go­ing.</p>
    <p>“We just didn’t turn up un­til they scored the sec­ond goal – then we started play­ing. I can’t fault any­one’s ef­fort and we were close to get­ting the third, which would have been an achieve­ment against a good Leipzig side.”</p>
    <p>United next host neigh­bours City in the league on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>“As a foot­baller you can’t feel sorry for your­self. You can do for a few min­utes tonight, but that’s it,” Sol­sk­jaer added. “We have a mas­sive game on Satur­day and we need to fo­cus on that.”</p>
    <p>Leipzig avenged their 5-0 trounc­ing at Old Traf­ford to the de­light of their coach Ju­lian Nagels­mann.</p>
    <p>“It wasn’t easy to have had a 5-0 de­feat in Oc­to­ber, then to have to win the sec­ond game to go to the knock­out stage,” said the Ger­man, whose team reached the semi-fi­nals last sea­son.</p>
    <p>“We got the win to­day and I think it’s de­served. The win is very im­por­tant for the boys so they re­alise that we were not a one-hit won­der last year (sea­son), that we ad­vanced again to the knock­out stage.”</p>

Nev&#xAD;er&#xAD;the&#xAD;less, it was too lit&#xAD;tle too late, as the English side crashed out of the Cham&#xAD;pi&#xAD;ons League af&#xAD;ter their 3-2 loss in Ger&#xAD;many.</p>
