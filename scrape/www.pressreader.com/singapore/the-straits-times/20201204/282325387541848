    <p>An on­line exhibition de­pict­ing how re­la­tions be­tween Sin­ga­pore and China have grown was vir­tu­ally launched at the Lianhe Zaobao Sin­ga­pore-China Fo­rum yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The exhibition is based on the photo book, In The Founders’ Foot­steps – 30 years Of Sin­ga­pore-China Diplo­matic Re­la­tions, which was pub­lished on Oct 3 by Zaobao and ThinkChina, an e-mag­a­zine with a fo­cus on that coun­try.</p>
    <p>It fol­lows the l ate found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew’s vis­its to China and how he laid the foun­da­tions for the diplo­matic re­la­tion­ship be­tween the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong said at the fo­rum that Sino-Sin­ga­pore ties have deep­ened, pro­gress­ing from col­lab­o­ra­tions in eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment to those in gov­er­nance and so­cial de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>“That shows the strength of our re­la­tion­ship,” he said, adding that le­gal and ju­di­cial co­op­er­a­tion is an area that “a coun­try may guard more closely be­cause it re­lates to how we pro­tect the well-be­ing of our peo­ple”.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong, who was the fo­rum’s guest of hon­our, pointed out that Chief Jus­tices in both coun­tries have co-chaired an an­nual round­table to im­prove ju­di­cial sys­tems and rule of law since Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong and Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping iden­ti­fied le­gal and ju­di­cial co­op­er­a­tion as a key area of bi­lat­eral co­op­er­a­tion in Septem­ber 2017.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong, who is also Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Law, said: “Although we have dif­fer­ent le­gal sys­tems – com­mon law sys­tem in Sin­ga­pore and civil law sys­tem in China – there are still many com­mon­al­i­ties and much (where) we can share and work with one an­other.</p>
    <p>“Both coun­tries be­lieve that a strong le­gal sys­tem un­der­pins an open, in­clu­sive and rules-based mul­ti­lat­eral trad­ing sys­tem.”</p>
    <p>Eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion in the re­gion, how­ever, should still re­main a fo­cus for the two coun­tries, said former vice-min­is­ter at the Chi­nese Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs He Yafei in his keynote ad­dress.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor He said “con­tin­ued eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion and re­gional in­te­gra­tion is a sure way to ex­pand mar­kets and pro­mote free trade and in­vest­ment in the re­gion”.</p>
    <p>He added: “With geopo­lit­i­cal ten­sions high be­tween ma­jor pow­ers, es­pe­cially be­tween the United States and China, pro­tec­tion­ism surg­ing ahead and global sup­ply chains set to be read­justed, global free trade and in­vest­ment will meet fur­ther head­winds.</p>
    <p>“It is high time, there­fore, to build re­gional sup­ply chains to bet­ter utilise re­sources... in the re­gion.”</p>
    <p>He also urged Asean coun­tries to work to­gether to con­struct a re­gional se­cu­rity frame­work.</p>
    <p>“But that se­cu­rity frame­work should not be purely based on mil­i­tary al­liances... but should be based more, or rather, on col­lec­tive and co­op­er­a­tive se­cu­rity,” he added.</p>
    <p>Prof He said the strat­egy of get­ting “eco­nom­i­cally close to China but re­ly­ing on the US for pro­tec­tion is a bad choice and not go­ing to work for this re­gion”.</p>
    <p>“China has re­peat­edly demon­strated its de­ter­mi­na­tion to peace­ful de­vel­op­ment, and its Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive and will­ing­ness to work out a code of con­duct on the South China Sea should be enough ev­i­dence for the re­gion that China is try­ing its best to build peace in this re­gion,” he added.</p>
    <p>“We shouldn’t use al­liances that are left over from his­tory to tar­get China or other coun­tries. This will cre­ate com­pli­ca­tions. We need to leave al­liances be­hind to build a se­cu­rity frame­work for the re­gion. Asean can play a crit­i­cal role in such a fu­ture ef­fort,” Prof He said.</p>
