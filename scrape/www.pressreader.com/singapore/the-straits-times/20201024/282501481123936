    <p>BU YE TIAN (1982)</p>
    <p>In the early 1980s, a ground-up ini­tia­tive funded by the late play­wright and poet Goh Poh Seng sought to re­ju­ve­nate the Sin­ga­pore River, which had lost much of its vigour.</p>
    <p>Its port ac­tiv­i­ties had been re­lo­cated else­where and the ad­ja­cent fi­nan­cial dis­trict was en­croach­ing men­ac­ingly to­wards its Bri­tish colo­nial-era shop­houses built in the 1920s and 1930s.</p>
    <p>Dr Goh com­mis­sioned Wil­liam Lim As­so­ci­ates to pro­duce an un­so­licited adap­tive re­use scheme.</p>
    <p>A team with Mr Mok at the helm pro­posed to re­tain a length of about 110 shop­houses that had pre­vi­ously been used by the ship­ping in­dus­try for trad­ing and stor­age, ti­tled Bu Ye Tian (right) or a “place of cease­less ac­tiv­i­ties”, which was the traditiona­l name of the nearby Kreta Ayer.</p>
    <p>Although Bu Ye Tian was not of­fi­cially adopted by the Gov­ern­ment, the ground-break­ing pro­posal played a ma­jor role in ac­cel­er­at­ing the con­ser­va­tion move­ment in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In 1989, the plan­ning au­thor­i­ties an­nounced the con­ser­va­tion of all 110 shop­houses.</p>
    <p>Con­ser­va­tion ex­pert Ho Weng Hin, who is a found­ing part­ner of ar­chi­tec­tural con­ser­va­tion spe­cial­ist con­sul­tancy Stu­dio Lapis, first came across the pro­ject when he was a stu­dent of ar­chi­tec­ture in­tern­ing at Wil­liam Lim As­so­ci­ates in 1998.</p>
    <p>“The evoca­tive traditiona­l Chi­nese paint­ing on the cover was cap­ti­vat­ing as it pre­sented a bird’s-eye view of his­toric godowns and shop­houses along Boat Quay in a man­ner never seen be­fore,” says Mr Ho, 45, who is a co-au­thor of the 2015 book, Our Mod­ern Past: A Vis­ual Sur­vey Of</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Ar­chi­tec­ture 1920s-1970s.</p>
    <p>“The Bu Ye Tian re­port came at an im­por­tant point in Sin­ga­pore’s devel­op­ment his­tory, when ur­ban re­newal and de­mo­li­tion of the old city cen­tre was in high gear, in the 1980s. It sought to change how the au­thor­i­ties and the public viewed the di­lap­i­dated ur­ban fab­ric, as be­ing ripe for de­mo­li­tion and rede­vel­op­ment,” adds Mr Ho.</p>
    <p>Mr Mok says he per­son­ally wit­nessed the era when his men­tor Mr Lim and Mr Tay Kheng Soon ad­vo­cated for the con­ser­va­tion of his­toric build­ings. “This time round, it is their works and oth­ers from their gen­er­a­tion that we have to fight for,” says Mr Mok, a for­mer board mem­ber of the Ur­ban Rede­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity and the Preser­va­tion of Sites and Mon­u­ments.</p>
    <p>He cur­rently sits on the boards of the Sin­ga­pore Land Au­thor­ity and JTC Cor­po­ra­tion.</p>
