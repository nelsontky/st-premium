    <p>• Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) play-off games were can­celled for a sec­ond straight day on Thurs­day, but the league yes­ter­day said it would soon is­sue a state­ment to the pub­lic that will deal with mat­ters raised by the Black Lives Mat­ter move­ment.</p>
    <p>Quot­ing NBA com­mis­sioner Adam Sil­ver, an of­fi­cial tweet read: “The dis­cus­sion cen­tred on how we can best col­lab­o­rate to ad­dress a broad range of is­sues, in­clud­ing in­creas­ing ac­cess to vot­ing, pro­mot­ing civic en­gage­ment, and ad­vo­cat­ing for po­lice and crim­i­nal jus­tice re­form... We are ded­i­cated to driv­ing the sus­tain­able change that is long over­due.”</p>
    <p>The full state­ment was not avail­able by press time, but the play­ers have re­port­edly pledged to re­turn to the court while seek­ing sup­port from team own­ers in tack­ling racial injustice.</p>
    <p>While teams yes­ter­day re­turned to prac­tice, a work­out sched­ule at the Dis­ney World cam­pus in­di­cated a third con­sec­u­tive day with­out play-off games.</p>
    <p>About 100 NBA em­ploy­ees also walked off the job yes­ter­day in sup­port of the so­cial jus­tice ef­forts of the play­ers, ESPN re­ported.</p>
    <p>The Mil­wau­kee Bucks-led boy­cott in­side the NBA’s Or­lando bub­ble on Wed­nes­day sparked a wave of protests that saw dozens of games called off across an ar­ray of sports – bas­ket­ball, foot­ball, base­ball, ice hockey and ten­nis.</p>
    <p>Black play­ers, their team­mates and sup­port­ers de­manded ac­tion in the face of yet an­other po­lice shoot­ing of an African-Amer­i­can.</p>
    <p>Ja­cob Blake was shot sev­eral times in the back in the Mid­west­ern city of Kenosha on Sun­day, lead­ing to na­tion­wide protests and un­rest.</p>
    <p>The Bucks’ boy­cott, which was joined by their sched­uled op­po­nents, the Or­lando Magic, prompted the NBA to post­pone all three play-off games sched­uled for Wed­nes­day and three more slated for Thurs­day as play­ers from all teams de­bated whether to con­tinue the sea­son al­ready dis­rupted by the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Play­ers re­port­edly agreed on Thurs­day to con­tinue the play-offs, with LeBron James and the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers – who had been in favour of aban­don­ing the sea­son the night be­fore – re­port­edly “on</p>
    <p>NEED FOR IMMEDIATE CHANGE</p>
    <p>Change doesn’t hap­pen with just talk!! It hap­pens with ac­tion and needs to hap­pen NOW!</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>LEBRON JAMES, in a tweet on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>board” with the de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>“NBA play-off games for (Thurs­day) will not be played as sched­uled,” league ex­ec­u­tive vice-pres­i­dent Mike Bass said in a state­ment af­ter an NBA Board of Gover­nors meet­ing on Thurs­day. “We’re hope­ful to re­sume games ei­ther Fri­day or Satur­day.”</p>
    <p>ESPN and other US me­dia re­ported on Thurs­day that games would most likely re­sume today, but there was no con­fir­ma­tion by press time.</p>
    <p>Play­ers from all 13 teams left in Or­lando, along with rep­re­sen­ta­tives from the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball Play­ers As­so­ci­a­tion, the league of­fice and NBA Labour Re­la­tions Com­mit­tee chair­man and bas­ket­ball leg­end</p>
    <p>Michael Jordan met on Thurs­day to dis­cuss player con­cerns.</p>
    <p>De­tails of the meet­ing were not im­me­di­ately avail­able, but ESPN said that play­ers pushed for own­ers to join them in a “di­rect ac­tion plan” to pro­mote voter turnout, po­lice ac­count­abil­ity and po­lice re­form leg­is­la­tion.</p>
