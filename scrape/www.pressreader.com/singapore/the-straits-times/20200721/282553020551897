    <p>TOKYO Hana Kimura, a pro­fes­sional wrestler in Ja­pan, joined the cast of the hit re­al­ity show Ter­race House in Septem­ber last year be­cause, she said, she wanted “to find a won­der­ful ro­mance”.</p>
    <p>It was a com­mon enough goal on Ter­race House, which fol­lows six young men and women liv­ing to­gether in a gor­geous house as they nav­i­gate love, life and ca­reers.</p>
    <p>Over five sea­sons on Ja­pan’s Fuji TV and Net­flix – which car­ries it in about 190 coun­tries – the se­ries be­came a global phe­nom­e­non, beloved by fans and crit­ics around the world for its gen­tle spin on the “strangers shar­ing a posh res­i­dence” genre, one of the old­est re­al­ity-tele­vi­sion for­mats.</p>
    <p>Nine months later, Kimura was dead. She was found at her home in Tokyo on May 23, along with sev­eral sui­cide notes. A se­ries of fore­bod­ing tweets and In­sta­gram sto­ries pre­ceded her death. She was 22 years old.</p>
    <p>It is im­pos­si­ble to know why some­one would take her own life. But in the weeks lead­ing up to her death, Kimura had be­come the tar­get of ha­tred on so­cial me­dia – much of it in­spired by be­hav­iour on Ter­race House which, she told a friend, the show’s pro­duc­ers had in­structed her to per­form.</p>
    <p>Hours be­fore Kimura died, she tweeted: “Every day, I re­ceive nearly 100 hon­est opin­ions and I can­not deny that I get hurt.”</p>
    <p>Her death sparked a na­tional reck­on­ing with cy­ber bul­ly­ing in Ja­pan and brought a sud­den, tragic end to Ter­race House.</p>
    <p>Fuji TV quickly can­celled the re­main­der of the cur­rent sea­son and has not said whether the show will ever re­turn.</p>
    <p>Net­flix – which con­tin­ues to carry ex­ist­ing episodes, in­clud­ing those fea­tur­ing Kimura – de­clined to com­ment for this ar­ti­cle.</p>
    <p>But those close to Kimura, such as her mother, Kyoko Kimura, con­tinue to won­der to what ex­tent the gen­tle re­al­ity show set Hana up for a fa­tal emo­tional de­cline.</p>
    <p>This week she filed a com­plaint with a Ja­panese broad­cast­ing ethics watch­dog, the Broad­cast­ing Ethics & Pro­gram Im­prove­ment Or­ga­ni­za­tion, im­pli­cat­ing the show in her daugh­ter’s death and al­leg­ing that the show had de­picted Hana as an ag­gres­sive and vi­o­lent per­son, in­fring­ing on her per­sonal rights.</p>
    <p>She said she re­mains deeply dis­ap­pointed with the re­sponse to the tragedy – or lack thereof – by Fuji TV, East En­ter­tain­ment (the pro­duc­tion com­pany that works on Ter­race House) and Net­flix.</p>
    <p>It is com­mon knowl­edge that re­al­ity shows are heav­ily pro­duced and edited to cre­ate nar­ra­tives and drama, but many fans be­lieved the art­fully ba­nal Ter­race House was more real than most.</p>
    <p>The in­ter­ac­tions between room­mates could be en­dear­ingly halt­ing and clumsy, and long stretches of time might pass in which hardly any­thing hap­pened.</p>
    <p>Both Fuji TV and the show’s “gos­sip panel” of celebri­ties, who pro­vided run­ning com­men­tary on the ac­tion in the house from a sep­a­rate stu­dio, re­peat­edly said there was “no script at all”.</p>
    <p>While some for­mer cast mem­bers stand be­hind Ter­race House as an hon­est, trans­par­ent look into their time and ex­pe­ri­ence in the house, oth­ers say the show was just as ma­nip­u­lated as its crasser re­al­i­tyTV cousins.</p>
    <p>In in­ter­views, they said Fuji TV staff mem­bers had ex­ten­sively con­sulted par­tic­i­pants about their feel­ings and told them to have cer­tain con­ver­sa­tions or take cer­tain ac­tions.</p>
    <p>They said staff in­ter­ven­tions had re­sulted in dates, ar­gu­ments and some of the show’s most iconic scenes. This in­ter­ven­tion in­cluded the event that turned Kimura into a pariah.</p>
    <p>One episode, i n which she re­acted an­grily to a room­mate for ac­ci­den­tally ru­in­ing one of her prized wrestling cos­tumes, led to a bar­rage of in­sults on Twit­ter and In­sta­gram, in­clud­ing some telling Kimura to “die” and “dis­ap­pear”.</p>
    <p>Be­cause cast mem­bers tended to have a l ess con­fronta­tional ap­proach to con­flict res­o­lu­tion, as is com­mon i n Ja­pan, the outburst likely seemed like cli­mac­tic drama to many view­ers.</p>
    <p>A se­ries of mes­sages on Line – a pop­u­lar Ja­panese mes­sag­ing app – from Kimura to a friend, orig­i­nally posted by Ja­panese mag­a­zine Bun­shun On­line and shared with The Times by Kyoko Kimura, in­di­cate the scene was staged by pro­duc­ers.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the texts, the staff had in­structed Kimura to slap the room­mate, Kai Kobayashi, and lose her tem­per.</p>
    <p>“It’s not real,” she wrote. “I re­ally feel ter­ri­ble about it.”</p>
    <p>Ms Reiko Hara, a spokesman for Fuji TV, said, “there was no im­proper stag­ing or in­struc­tion given” and added “we are in the mid­dle of in­ves­ti­gat­ing the sit­u­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>Some for­mer par­tic­i­pants dis­pute claims that the ac­tion was en­gi­neered by pro­duc­ers.</p>
    <p>But even those who en­joyed their time on the show ac­knowl­edged that the pas­sion­ate fan base can be cruel.</p>
    <p>The more trou­ble­some as­pects of Ter­race House also shed light on press­ing so­cial is­sues in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment author­i­ties have wres­tled for years with how to bal­ance on­line abuse with free­dom of ex­pres­sion. Af­ter Kimura’s sui­cide, they re­newed the push to pun­ish cy­ber bul­ly­ing.</p>
    <p>Cur­rent ed­u­ca­tion on cy­ber bul­ly­ing in Ja­pan is not suf­fi­cient to deal with the breadth of the prob­lem, said Mr Michal Ptaszyn­ski, a com­puter sci­ence pro­fes­sor at the Ki­tami In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy in Hokkaido, who re­searches cy­ber bul­ly­ing.</p>
    <p>“Kids learn briefly about ha­rass­ment in classes on so­ci­ety,” he said. “It still does not give them any means of de­fence in ac­tual cy­ber­bul­ly­ing sit­u­a­tions.”</p>
