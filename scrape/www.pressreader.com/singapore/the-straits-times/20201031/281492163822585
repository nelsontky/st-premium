    <p>Sin­ga­pore is at a cross­roads.</p>
    <p>Com­mu­nity cases here are now ex­tremely low, with just six in the past fort­night.</p>
    <p>This means mea­sures to con­tain the virus here are work­ing and Sin­ga­pore should be able to sig­nif­i­cantly ease them with lit­tle risk, ex­perts have pointed out to The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore can also open up its bor­ders to vis­i­tors from coun­tries with equally low spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>But it should not do both, the ex­perts cau­tioned.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery eas­ing of mea­sures, whether in­ter­nally or in terms of bor­der con­trol, in­creases risks. Do­ing too much too soon could re­sult in a ma­jor sec­ond-wave out­break, they ex­plained.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has de­cided on open­ing its bor­ders, with the prom­ise of a slight eas­ing of do­mes­tic mea­sures, pro­vided the in­fec­tion num­bers stay low.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple in gen­eral have wel­comed the move that al­lows for eas­ier travel with­out the need for a 14-day quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>But al­low­ing travel to re­sume, even in a con­trolled man­ner, ex­poses the coun­try to the risk of im­ported in­fec­tions that could spread to the com­mu­nity, the ex­perts said.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, there are more than 400,000 new Covid-19 in­fec­tions and about 5,000 deaths a day.</p>
    <p>With win­ter ap­proach­ing in the North­ern Hemi­sphere, there are fears the num­bers may surge.</p>
    <p>While this is not the best time to al­low freer travel with coun­tries there, hold­ing off would mean a de­lay of sev­eral months.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, said Sin­ga­pore must be care­ful about which coun­tries it opens its bor­ders to.</p>
    <p>“There are cer­tainly low-risk coun­tries and ter­ri­to­ries, in­clud­ing New Zealand, Hong Kong, Tai­wan, Thai­land, Viet­nam, Aus­tralia and China, where pub­lic health and bor­der con­trol mea­sures are sen­si­ble, ef­fec­tive, and im­ple­mented and en­forced well,” he said.</p>
    <p>“At the other end of the spec­trum, there are high-risk coun­tries where there are ram­pant trans­mis­sions in the com­mu­nity, in part be­cause of in­ad­e­quate or poorly en­forced mea­sures.”</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Alex Cook, vice-dean of re­search at the school, noted that if the preva­lence of Covid-19 in the other coun­try is the same as in Sin­ga­pore, “there’s no ex­tra risk from hav­ing peo­ple travel from one to the other, and even less risk if there’s pre-de­par­ture and on-ar­rival test­ing”.</p>
    <p>Dr Asok Ku­rup, who chairs the Academy of Medicine’s Chap­ter of In­fec­tious Dis­ease Physi­cians, ques­tioned why Sin­ga­pore is open­ing its doors to In­done­sia, which is fac­ing thou­sands of new in­fec­tions daily.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has also an­nounced green lane travel with Ger­many, which is see­ing thou­sands of new Covid-19 in­fec­tions daily and has gone into lock­down.</p>
    <p>“Coun­tries which have not had a sus­tain­able mit­i­ga­tion of cases should not be con­sid­ered for re­cip­ro­cal green lane travel,” Dr Ku­rup said.</p>
    <p>The travel ar­range­ments vary with each coun­try. Some in­volve the need to ad­here to strict itin­er­ar­ies, while for oth­ers, vis­i­tors are free to roam at will.</p>
    <p>Though trav­ellers need to be tested be­fore their jour­ney and/or on ar­rival, the risk in al­low­ing travel to re­sume lies in for­eign­ers bring­ing the virus here, as well as Sin­ga­pore­ans get­ting in­fected over­seas and re­turn­ing un­de­tected.</p>
    <p>Test­ing picks up only peo­ple who are in­fected, and not those who have the virus in them dur­ing the in­cu­ba­tion pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Prof Cook said: “Re­plac­ing quar­an­tine with pre- and post-de­par­ture test­ing might fil­ter out 80 per cent to 90 per cent of the cases, de­pend­ing on what tests you’re do­ing.”</p>
    <p>While open­ing bor­ders will raise the risk of bring­ing in the virus and rein­tro­duc­ing Covid-19 to the com­mu­nity, not open­ing the bor­ders will have a ma­jor neg­a­tive im­pact on the econ­omy and jobs.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has al­ways looked to the world as its hin­ter­land. Busi­ness travel and tourism are a ma­jor con­trib­u­tor to the econ­omy, not just bring­ing in money, but also pro­vid­ing tens of thou­sands of jobs in re­lated sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Tourism ac­counted for 4 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct last year, or close to $20 bil­lion in di­rect con­tri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>Aside from that, ease of travel is one of Sin­ga­pore’s sell­ing points in at­tract­ing in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>As Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung told Par­lia­ment ear­lier this month: “When a com­pany puts a sig­nif­i­cant in­vest­ment in Sin­ga­pore, one key rea­son for them to do that is our su­pe­rior air con­nec­tiv­ity be­cause that means their cus­tomers, sup­pli­ers, part­ners and key ex­ec­u­tives can travel in and out of Sin­ga­pore eas­ily.”</p>
    <p>He added: “The longer our bor­ders re­main closed, the greater the risk of los­ing our air hub sta­tus and our at­trac­tive­ness as a place to in­vest, and to cre­ate jobs be­cause of those in­vest­ments.”</p>
    <p>Ex­perts in­ter­viewed are con­fi­dent that Sin­ga­pore will be able to han­dle any im­port of the virus, with co­op­er­a­tion from the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple here must con­tinue to dis­in­fect their hands, wear masks and en­sure they stand a me­tre away from the next per­son. The curbs on large gath­er­ings should stay. This will limit the spread of the virus should trav­ellers bring it in.</p>
    <p>Prof Cook said: “I’m sure that we will see clus­ters caused by im­por­ta­tion, but it’s worth high­light­ing that the mea­sures we have in place have been able to con­tain com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion since June.”</p>
    <p>Dr Ku­rup added: “I don’t think we will fall back to the grim ear­lier days, pro­vided we main­tain cur­rent pub­lic health mea­sures which need to be sus­tained.”</p>
    <p>Prof Teo said that if mea­sures here are eased sig­nif­i­cantly and large gath­er­ings are per­mit­ted, then any com­mu­nity spread could hap­pen “at an ac­cel­er­ated pace”.</p>
    <p>But if the mea­sures are prop­erly ad­hered to, and gath­er­ings are capped and con­trolled, the spread can be con­tained at man­age­able lev­els, even if there are leak­ages from trav­ellers, he said.</p>
    <p>Also, Sin­ga­pore is far more pre­pared to­day than it was at the start of the year, when in­fected vis­i­tors brought the out­break here.</p>
    <p>Close to 58,000 peo­ple have been in­fected and 28 peo­ple have died.</p>
    <p>Said Prof Cook: “Back then, we did not have the test­ing ca­pac­ity we have now, we didn’t have all the ad­juncts to our con­tact trac­ing (TraceTo­gether and SafeEn­try) we have now, and mask wear­ing was not man­dated.”</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher, a se­nior in­fec­tious diseases ex­pert at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hospi­tal, agreed. “Mea­sures such as mask­ing, safe dis­tanc­ing and lim­it­ing the size of gath­er­ings are key to open­ing our bor­ders.”</p>
    <p>He said that while open­ing up to vis­i­tors is not with­out risks, “it is not a risk with­out ben­e­fit”. “In fact, it’s a small risk with huge ben­e­fit. I am con­fi­dent Sin­ga­pore can man­age ex­tra cases if they oc­cur.”</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Leo Yee Sin, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Diseases, said</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has been able to keep com­mu­nity cases low on ac­count of “the ef­fort and co­op­er­a­tion of ev­ery­one in the com­mu­nity”.</p>
    <p>Coun­tries with less strict mea­sures and are open to travel con­tinue to see a large num­ber of daily in­fec­tions and deaths.</p>
    <p>Prof Leo said re­lax­ing bor­der con­trols and other mea­sures “must be cal­i­brated with the abil­ity to cush­ion the down­side”.</p>
    <p>Coun­ter­mea­sures must also be</p>
    <p>in place and rolled out quickly if re­quired. Th­ese in­clude tweak­ing bor­der con­trols should num­bers surge.</p>
    <p>Prof Cook said the im­pact of al­low­ing freer travel with part­ner coun­tries de­pends on three fac­tors: how many peo­ple ar­rive in a day, what is the in­ci­dence in the source coun­try, and what frac­tion of in­fected trav­ellers is fil­tered out through bor­der mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“If we’re only ad­mit­ting a hand­ful of busi­ness­men or women, or vis­it­ing dig­ni­taries, then we can ac­cept a more por­ous net. If we’re hop­ing for mass tourism with tens or hun­dreds of thou­sands of trav­ellers a day, then we need a net that will catch cases more thor­oughly,” he said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, even with no quar­an­tine re­quired, Sin­ga­pore is un­likely to see a flood of tourists, given the cost of the test, which is about $200 here.</p>
    <p>Since Sept 1, vis­i­tors from Brunei and New Zealand have been al­lowed in with­out quar­an­tine re­quire­ments, but there has been no large in­flux so far. They have not re­cip­ro­cated the ar­range­ment for Sin­ga­pore­ans want­ing to go there.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is also set­ting up a travel bub­ble with Hong Kong. This is a two-way agree­ment, and un­like green lane ar­range­ments with some coun­tries, al­lows for un­struc­tured leisure travel.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment is also in­di­rectly en­cour­ag­ing peo­ple here to travel by pro­vid­ing free Covid-19 tests on their re­turn and sub­sidised treat­ment, as well as in­sur­ance cov­er­age should they be in­fected.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, when travel was dis­cour­aged, those who left Sin­ga­pore af­ter March 26 had to pay the full cost of any Covid-19 in­fec­tion di­ag­nosed within 14 days of their re­turn. Their treat­ment was also not cov­ered by their health in­sur­ance.</p>
    <p>As some of the ex­perts noted, how suc­cess­ful the re­lax­ation of travel curbs proves to be in safely boost­ing the econ­omy will de­pend on peo­ple’s will­ing­ness to travel while the pan­demic is rag­ing, and on peo­ple here strictly ad­her­ing to pro­tec­tive mea­sures to pre­vent a mas­sive out­break.</p>
    <p>But one thing is clear: It will not be ex­actly like old times.</p>
    <p>As Prof Leo said: “It is im­por­tant to men­tally pre­pare that life will not be the same as be­fore Covid-19.”</p>
