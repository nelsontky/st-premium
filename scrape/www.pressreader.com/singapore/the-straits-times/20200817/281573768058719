    <p>After be­ing cleared of Covid-19, dor­mi­to­ries hous­ing for­eign work­ers in Sin­ga­pore will now be shift­ing their op­er­a­tions out of “cri­sis mode” and on to the next phase. Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo an­nounced the move through a Face­book post on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>After be­ing cleared of Covid-19, dor­mi­to­ries hous­ing for­eign work­ers here will now be shift­ing their op­er­a­tions out of “cri­sis mode” and on to the next phase.</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo an­nounced the move in a Face­book post on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>In her post, she noted the work of the in­ter-agency task force, com­pris­ing close to 3,000 of­fi­cers, in­clud­ing 1,000 from the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM), in car­ing for mi­grant work­ers dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo and Dr Tan See Leng, Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Man­power and for Trade and In­dus­try, hosted Se­nior Min­is­ter and Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Na­tional Se­cu­rity Teo Chee Hean at the MOM Ser­vice Cen­tre last Fri­day to give an up­date on the progress made by the in­ter-agency task force. It was set up to pro­vide sup­port to for­eign work­ers and dor­mi­tory op­er­a­tors as cases of Covid-19 spiked in the dor­mi­to­ries ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>The dor­mi­to­ries will now shift into a sus­tain­able model fo­cus­ing on three key phases: safe re­open­ing, safe tran­si­tion and safe na­tion.</p>
    <p>“In the ini­tial phase, we fo­cused on sav­ing lives dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker by meet­ing short-term needs. As we grad­u­ally re­open, we must now chan­nel our ef­forts into pro­tect­ing liveli­hoods and guard­ing against new in­fec­tions,” said Mrs Teo. She thanked the in­ter-agency task force of­fi­cers and stake­hold­ers, in­clud­ing the em­ploy­ers and dor­mi­tory op­er­a­tors, for their ef­forts to en­sure the safety and well-be­ing of mi­grant work­ers, while ac­knowl­edg­ing the work that lay ahead.</p>
    <p>Last week, new cases were de­tected at dor­mi­to­ries de­clared to be cleared of the coro­n­avirus, and the au­thor­i­ties said they were mon­i­tor­ing the sit­u­a­tion to man­age the risk of new out­breaks.</p>
    <p>A joint state­ment by MOM, the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity, the Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Board and the Health Pro­mo­tion Board last Tues­day pointed to fresh in­fec­tions in cleared dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>It said that safe­guards have been put in place to make sure that the in­ten­sive ef­forts spent over the past four months on the dor­mi­to­ries so far did not go to waste.</p>
    <p>“With more daily move­ments in and out of the dor­mi­to­ries, it is even more im­por­tant for ev­ery­one to re­main vig­i­lant to guard against new in­fec­tions,” the joint state­ment said.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, six new cases were linked to Kian Teck Dor­mi­tory, while two oth­ers were linked to Kian Teck Hos­tel, ac­cord­ing to the Min­istry of Health’s up­date last Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The joint state­ment last Tues­day said the mea­sures to en­sure that work­ers can safely restart work in­clude re­quir­ing them to re­port their tem­per­a­ture and any symp­toms of acute res­pi­ra­tory ill­ness through an app twice a day.</p>
    <p>Work­ers in dor­mi­to­ries and those who work on­site in the con­struc­tion, marine and process sec­tors will also have to be swab tested once ev­ery 14 days.</p>
    <p>Other mea­sures i nclude stag­gered pick-up and drop-off times for work­ers to and from their work­sites, up­dat­ing the ad­dresses of work­ers’ res­i­dences and min­imis­ing mix­ing be­tween blocks.</p>
    <p>Waste­water from higher-risk dor­mi­to­ries is also mon­i­tored closely for traces of the Covid-19 virus, and the num­ber of mi­grant work­ers who re­port sick at any par­tic­u­lar med­i­cal post is tracked as pos­si­ble early in­di­ca­tions of clus­ters.</p>
    <p>Plans are in place to quickly quar­an­tine and iso­late at-risk work­ers if a po­ten­tial in­fec­tion sur­faces.</p>
