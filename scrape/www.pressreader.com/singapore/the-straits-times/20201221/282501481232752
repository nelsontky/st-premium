    <p>• Manch­ester City man­ager Pep Guardi­ola was frus­trated by his side’s profli­gacy in Satur­day’s 1-0 Pre­mier League vic­tory at Southamp­ton, warn­ing his play­ers they must de­velop a killer in­stinct in front of goal if they are to mount a suc­cess­ful ti­tle chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>Ra­heem Ster­ling gave the vis­i­tors an early lead at St Mary’s but Kevin de Bruyne, Bernardo Silva and Riyad Mahrez all missed gilt­edged op­por­tu­ni­ties to drive home their ad­van­tage, a hall­mark of City’s sea­son so far.</p>
    <p>Guardi­ola’s side have scored 19 goals i n 13 Pre­mier League games, just over half of the 37 they had net­ted at the same stage of the pre­vi­ous cam­paign.</p>
    <p>With Brazil for­ward Gabriel Je­sus in a funk – he has just two topflight goals this term – and Ser­gio Aguero, the club’s record scorer, not fit enough to start af­ter an in­jury-dis­rupted cam­paign, Guardi­ola is con­cerned as his play­ers are find­ing it hard to make up for the short­fall.</p>
    <p>“Our goal is to try and win games, to be up there as quickly as pos­si­ble, as close to the top of league,” he said. “But our mo­men­tum is not good up front. We will strug­gle if we don’t break this sit­u­a­tion and score more goals.”</p>
    <p>Ster­ling, who net­ted his fourth league goal this term, agreed, say­ing: “Try­ing to win games and score goals has been dif­fi­cult for us. We had a word with our­selves, dug deep and found some­thing from within. We’re a top foot­ball club and we weren’t where we needed to be at.</p>
    <p>“We knew how im­por­tant it was to win to­day, and we’re happy to get the three points.”</p>
    <p>City were sixth on 23 points – eight adrift of lead­ers and cham­pi­ons Liver­pool, be­fore yes­ter­day’s games – and Guardi­ola ad­mit­ted they could not af­ford to lose more ground on Jur­gen Klopp’s men.</p>
    <p>“We are far away,” he told Ama­zon Prime. “Liver­pool still have mo­men­tum. No doubts about how good they are.”</p>
    <p>City next face Ar­se­nal away in the League Cup quar­ter-fi­nals to­mor­row.</p>
