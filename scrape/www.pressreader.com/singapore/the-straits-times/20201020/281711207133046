    <p>PRAGUE • Hun­dreds of de­mon­stra­tors clashed with riot po­lice in Prague on Sun­day in a protest against so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules and gov­ern­ment mea­sures such as wear­ing face masks to stem the most acute spread of Covid-19 in Europe.</p>
    <p>Po­lice used tear gas, wa­ter can­non and an ar­moured per­son­nel car­rier to dis­perse the crowd of some 2,000 protesters who as­sem­bled at the city’s Old Town Square.</p>
    <p>Some people, mostly hockey and foot­ball fans, re­fused to leave af­ter the au­thor­i­ties ended the demon­stra­tion, and used small ex­plo­sive de­vices against the of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>About 100 people were ar­rested af­ter the protest, and 20 people were in­jured.</p>
    <p>The rally was le­gal on the con­di­tions that there would not be more than 500 people and that protesters fol­lowed so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules and wore face masks.</p>
    <p>The protesters who vi­o­lated the gov­ern­ment rules should be pun­ished “harshly”, Czech Prime Min­is­ter An­drej Babis wrote in a Face­book post.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate post, Mr Babis urged people to stay at home as much as pos­si­ble as this week would be key in the coun­try’s fight against the re­newed out­break.</p>
    <p>The Czech Repub­lic, which was one of Europe’s most suc­cess­ful na­tions in han­dling the pan­demic in the spring, is now fac­ing the con­ti­nent’s worst spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has shut schools, restau­rants and bars, and man­dated the wear­ing of face masks in pub­lic spa­ces.</p>
