    <p>There were no new coro­n­avirus cases in the com­mu­nity re­ported yes­ter­day, but there were two im­ported ones... The first case is a 52-year-old per­ma­nent res­i­dent who re­turned from In­dia. The other is a 32-year-old work per­mit holder who ar­rived from In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>There were no new coro­n­avirus cases in the com­mu­nity re­ported yes­ter­day, but there were two im­ported ones, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said last night.</p>
    <p>This brings Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,230.</p>
    <p>The first case is a 52-year-old per­ma­nent res­i­dent who re­turned from In­dia.</p>
    <p>The other is a 32-year-old work per­mit holder who ar­rived from In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>Both were placed on stay-home no­tice at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore. They were asymp­to­matic and tested pos­i­tive while serv­ing their no­tices.</p>
    <p>There were no cases from for­eign work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Two mosques have been added to the list of places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>The vis­its oc­curred at Masjid Te­meng­gong Daeng Ibrahim in Telok Blan­gah Road on Nov 19, and at Masjid Ah­mad in the West Coast area on Nov 20, said MOH.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients have vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes, and the times they vis­ited, to get peo­ple who were at those places at the same time to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>The full list of lo­ca­tions and times can be found on the gov.sg web­site.</p>
    <p>MOH has said that close con­tacts of the pa­tients would al­ready have been no­ti­fied, and there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>MOH said the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with a to­tal of five un­linked cases in the past week.</p>
    <p>With five cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 58,129 pa­tients have re­cov­ered from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>There are 28 pa­tients still in hospi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 29 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 29 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
