    <p>BEN­GALURU • Global stock mar­kets are forecast to close the year be­low their pre-pan­demic highs, but will still keep alive for at least an­other six months a bull run that is de­fy­ing a som­bre economic out­look across much of the world, Reuters polls of mar­ket ex­perts found.</p>
    <p>Share prices have surged as much as 57 per cent since hit­ting a bot­tom in late March, as traders and in­vestors quickly switched their fo­cus from what is sure to be the deep­est economic re­ces­sion on record to how swiftly the world may re­cover.</p>
    <p>But all the 17 in­dexes in Reuters polls of over 200 eq­uity strate­gists across Asia, Europe and the Amer­i­cas taken from Aug 12 to Tues­day were forecast to end this year be­low their pre-Covid-19 highs. Fif­teen were pro­jected to end the year lower than their 2019 close.</p>
    <p>While the lat­est find­ings were slightly more up­beat than those taken three months ago, the out­look for stock mar­kets from Asia to Europe to Amer­i­cas has limited up­side, if any, on weak cor­po­rate earn­ings and economic wor­ries.</p>
    <p>That sug­gests fur­ther gains will be harder to come by.</p>
    <p>“Eq­uity mar­kets re­bounded... (but) as this higher start­ing point rep­re­sents a mis­match be­tween eq­uity prices and fun­da­men­tals, we expect this di­ver­gence to be grad­u­ally re­flected in prices,” noted Ms Mon­ica De­fend, global head of re­search at Amundi As­set Man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>“Aided by the still-on­go­ing recovery of the eq­uity mar­ket, ex-ante re­turns for eq­uity over­all are set to peak in the medium term, los­ing steam there­after. We main­tain that the sub­se­quent recovery (in stocks) will not hap­pen im­me­di­ately, with spurts of re­lief ral­lies not quite reach­ing pre-pan­demic lev­els.”</p>
    <p>Awash with his­toric amounts of mon­e­tary and fis­cal stim­u­lus, 14 of 17 in­dexes were forecast to rise from here by year end, with nearly 60 per cent of about 110 strate­gists who had a view pre­dict­ing at least an­other six months of the cur­rent bull run.</p>
    <p>“Our view that eq­uity prices will rise fur­ther is un­der­pinned by our forecast that the global econ­omy will con­tinue to re­cover, even if more slowly and un­evenly than dur­ing its ini­tial bounce-back over the past few months, and that am­ple pol­icy sup­port will re­main in place for as long as it is needed,” said Ms Simona Gambarini, mar­kets econ­o­mist at Cap­i­tal Eco­nom­ics.</p>
    <p>Asked about the like­li­hood of a sig­nif­i­cant correction in stock mar­kets in the next three months, re­spon­dents were split, with 67 of 128 strate­gists pre­dict­ing it to be “un­likely” or “very un­likely”, de­spite lofty val­u­a­tions af­ter the re­cent rally. The rest said “likely” or “very likely”.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to a sep­a­rate ques­tion, there was no clear view on what would be the pri­mary driver of stock mar­kets for the rest of the year.</p>
    <p>De­spite the dis­con­nect be­tween United States share prices and the econ­omy, where un­em­ploy­ment has risen sharply as many states are still strug­gling to sup­press the virus, the S&P 500 wiped out all of its 35 per cent loss and swiftly re­turned to a record high.</p>
    <p>But that lat­est run-up on Wall Street is con­cen­trated among a hand­ful of very large tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>In the US, the so-called FAANG stocks – Face­book, Ama­zon, Ap­ple, Net­flix and Google-par­ent Al­pha­bet – have led the tech­nol­ogy and con­sumer dis­cre­tionary sec­tors back to record highs.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple has been a star per­former among FAANG stocks, with its mar­ket value swelling to US$2.15 tril­lion (S$2.94 tril­lion) – greater than all the com­po­nents in the bench­mark Lon­don FTSE 100 in­dex.</p>
    <p>Fore­casts from Refini­tiv I/B/E/S data show an­a­lysts expect a 20 per cent de­cline in earn­ings for S&P 500 com­pa­nies for this year, with the sec­ond quar­ter still seen as the low point for this year.</p>
    <p>“An­chor­ing in­vest­ment views to the past is be­com­ing less rel­e­vant, in our view, as struc­tural trends such as ris­ing in­equal­ity, de­glob­al­i­sa­tion, the pol­icy rev­o­lu­tion and sustainabi­lity race to­wards us,” noted port­fo­lio strate­gists at Black­Rock.</p>
    <p>ECONOMIC RECOVERY</p>
    <p>Our view that eq­uity prices will rise fur­ther is un­der­pinned by our forecast that the global econ­omy will con­tinue to re­cover, even if more slowly and un­evenly than dur­ing its ini­tial bounce-back over the past few months, and that am­ple pol­icy sup­port will re­main in place for as long as it is needed.</p>
    <p>MS SIMONA GAMBARINI,</p>
