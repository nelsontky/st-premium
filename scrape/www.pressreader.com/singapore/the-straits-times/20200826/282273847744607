    <p>ASUN­CION • For­mer Brazil star Ronald­inho was re­leased on Monday by a Paraguayan judge af­ter spend­ing five months in de­ten­tion over a forged pass­port.</p>
    <p>Judge Gus­tavo Amar­illa also re­leased his brother Roberto de As­sis Mor­eira, who like­wise had been held for a month in jail and an­other four months un­der house ar­rest in a ho­tel in the coun­try’s cap­i­tal, Asun­cion, on the same charge.</p>
    <p>Ronald­inho, the 40-year-old for­mer 2002 World Cup win­ner, “is free to travel to what­ever coun­try in the world he wants but he must in­form us if he changes his per­ma­nent res­i­dence” for a pe­riod of one year, Amar­illa said.</p>
    <p>“He has no restric­tions ex­cept for the ful­fil­ment of repa­ra­tions for dam­age to so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>Dressed in jeans, a black beret and black shirt, Ronald­inho ac­cepted the terms of his re­lease, in­clud­ing pay­ment of US$90,000 (S$123,200) in dam­ages.</p>
    <p>Amar­illa stressed that he was not is­su­ing a “de­fin­i­tive dis­missal” of the case but rather that Ronald­inho was ben­e­fit­ing from a “con­di­tional sus­pen­sion of the pro­ce­dure”.</p>
    <p>His brother, who is also the for­mer Barcelona for­ward’s busi­ness man­ager, was, on the other hand, given a two-year sus­pended sen­tence and told to pay US$110,000 in dam­ages.</p>
    <p>He must ap­pear be­fore a judge in Brazil ev­ery four months for two years and will have a crim­i­nal record.</p>
    <p>Prose­cu­tors said they did not be­lieve Ronald­inho took part in the plan to man­u­fac­ture the fake Paraguayan pass­ports but be­lieved Roberto was aware that the pass­ports were false.</p>
    <p>“They fla­grantly used a public doc­u­ment con­tain­ing false con­tent,” added Marcelo Pecci, one of the public prose­cu­tors, who called it a “very se­ri­ous” of­fence.</p>
    <p>Amar­illa said: “Ronald­inho’s sit­u­a­tion is not the same as Roberto’s. He has no obli­ga­tion to ap­pear be­fore any Brazil­ian ju­di­cial au­thor­ity. He must only re­port a change of ad­dress.”</p>
    <p>The broth­ers ar­rived in Paraguay on March 4 with Ronald­inho, the 2005 Bal­lon d’Or win­ner, due to take part in an event in sup­port of dis­ad­van­taged chil­dren.</p>
    <p>How­ever, two days later, the pair were taken into po­lice cus­tody when in­ves­ti­ga­tors raided their ho­tel fol­low­ing the dis­cov­ery they had used fake travel doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>Af­ter be­ing locked up in jail for a month, dur­ing which Ronald­inho cel­e­brated his 40th birth­day on March 21, the two men were then put un­der house ar­rest. They have spent over four months in a lux­ury ho­tel on US$1.6 mil­lion bail.</p>
    <p>The in­ves­ti­ga­tion has since ex­panded into a case of pos­si­ble money laun­der­ing and crim­i­nal as­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Some 18 peo­ple have al­ready been ar­rested in con­nec­tion with the case, most of them im­mi­gra­tion of­fi­cials or po­lice of­fi­cers.</p>
