    <p>The two stu­dents whose com­plaints of sex­ual mis­con­duct led to the sack­ing of Tem­busu Col­lege don Jeremy Fer­nando said that the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) went against their wishes to make a po­lice re­port and it did not in­form them be­fore go­ing to the po­lice.</p>
    <p>Both stu­dents said they were un­happy that NUS in­formed them only af­ter it had made a po­lice re­port against Dr Fer­nando.</p>
    <p>At a press con­fer­ence on Oct 23, NUS said it had reached out to in­form both vic­tims be­fore the po­lice re­port against Dr Fer­nando was made, but was able to reach only one of the vic­tims, and not the other.</p>
    <p>Mes­sages from NUS to the two stu­dents, seen by The Sun­day Times, show that the stu­dents were in­formed about the po­lice re­port af­ter it was made.</p>
    <p>One of the vic­tims said: “The trauma and anx­i­ety this caused was im­mense. It es­ca­lated be­yond my con­trol with­out my con­sent... I feel like I have been robbed of my au­ton­omy and agency.”</p>
    <p>She added: “While the po­lice of­fi­cers I have been in con­tact with have been ex­ceed­ingly ac­com­mo­dat­ing, this en­tire sit­u­a­tion has caused me a lot of anx­i­ety and resur­faced trauma.</p>
    <p>“This prece­dent of the im­per­a­tive to re­port to the po­lice, and do­ing so with­out our con­sent, can se­ri­ously de­ter other sur­vivors from com­ing for­ward.”</p>
    <p>At the press con­fer­ence, NUS said it had a le­gal obli­ga­tion to make a po­lice re­port un­der Sec­tion 424 of the Crim­i­nal Pro­ce­dure Code.</p>
    <p>The uni­ver­sity added that it chose to de­lay mak­ing the re­port out of con­sid­er­a­tion for the stu­dents’ men­tal well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>Un­der the law, any­one aware of the “com­mis­sion or the in­ten­tion of an­other per­son to com­mit any ar­restable of­fence shall, in the ab­sence of rea­son­able ex­cuse,” im­me­di­ately pro­vide the au­thor­i­ties with in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Su­nil Sud­heesan, who is the head of the crim­i­nal depart­ment at Quahe Woo & Palmer, said it is not clear that NUS was obliged to re­port the in­ci­dent to the po­lice.</p>
    <p>He said: “A rea­son­able ex­cuse is that the vic­tims did not want to re­port. It’s sub­ject to in­ter­pre­ta­tion...</p>
    <p>“This, in my opin­ion, is still a bit of a grey area, as to whether the duty is so trusted on NUS for them to re­port.”</p>
    <p>One of the vic­tims said that she wants NUS to make clear that both stu­dents were not given a choice in whether the uni­ver­sity should make a po­lice re­port.</p>
    <p>She also said both stu­dents have ev­i­dence that they were in­formed only af­ter the re­port was made.</p>
    <p>She added that she has asked NUS to is­sue a pub­lic clar­i­fi­ca­tion, but so far, has not heard from them.</p>
    <p>She said: “NUS and the Vic­tim Care Unit keep mak­ing as­sump­tions about what I want and what is ben­e­fi­cial for me as a sur­vivor.</p>
    <p>“Mean­while, my at­tempts to com­mu­ni­cate my needs are ne­glected and ig­nored, even af­ter they de­clared that they will do bet­ter and be more ac­tive in com­mu­ni­ca­tion.”</p>
    <p>A LOSS OF CON­TROL</p>
    <p>The trauma and anx­i­ety this caused was im­mense. It es­ca­lated be­yond my con­trol with­out my con­sent... I feel like I have been robbed of my au­ton­omy and agency.’’</p>
