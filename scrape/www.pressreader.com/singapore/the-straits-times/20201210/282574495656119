    <p>The film-maker and lec­turer in film stud­ies was in the school can­teen with her stu­dents at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s School of Art, De­sign and Me­dia when she found out she had re­ceived the Young Artist Award. She re­calls with a smile: “I was very thrilled. I was told not to tell any­one, so I was try­ing to con­trol my­self in front of my stu­dents.”</p>
    <p>She adds, chuck­ling, that she told her par­ents and her hus­band. “How can you keep a se­cret from your mum?”</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean, whose self-pro­claimed “very ro­jak” an­ces­try in­cludes a Ja­panese grand­mother and a Bri­tish-Por­tuguese Eurasian fa­ther, says she is still in shock. “I feel very flat­tered. It’s a lot of en­cour­age­ment. This has been a ter­ri­ble year for ev­ery­one.”</p>
    <p>The pan­demic scup­pered her plans to shoot her de­but fea­ture, which has been four years in the mak­ing. The Sin­ga­pore-Ja­pan co-pro­duc­tion is now sched­uled to shoot next spring and she is re­hears­ing her lead ac­tress via Zoom.</p>
    <p>Things are look­ing up, too, with re­cent news that she has been cho­sen to di­rect an episode for the sec­ond sea­son of HBO’s Folk­lore an­thol­ogy.</p>
    <p>She hopes to use her award to de­velop an­other project.</p>
    <p>As a female di­rec­tor, she hopes to set a good ex­am­ple for younger women. “I’m very thank­ful I was given the plat­form for my work to reach a larger au­di­ence. There are many bar­ri­ers to en­try in the film in­dus­try. My be­ing there is some sort of sig­nal that it’s fine for women to want to be di­rec­tors.”</p>
