    <p>MWho would have thought Sin­ga­pore­ans would spend most of 2020 with their faces con­cealed from one an­other?</p>
    <p>With masks made manda­tory to re­strict the spread of droplets, face cov­er­ings have be­come this year’s un­ex­pected top ac­ces­sory. The op­tions on the mar­ket – both dis­pos­able and re­us­able – are stag­ger­ing.</p>
    <p>Most have been re­ly­ing on the free re­us­able face masks from the Te­masek Foun­da­tion, which have im­proved in make with each round of dis­tri­bu­tion. In the third and most re­cent dis­tri­bu­tion ex­er­cise, each kit con­tained two black re­us­able masks – touted as “breath­able an­timi­cro­bial 3D masks” – avail­able in sizes and three re­us­able fil­ters.</p>
    <p>Mask­ing up in the new nor­mal also had its spillover ef­fects on the re­tail in­dus­try. Fash­ion de­sign­ers, re­tail brands and in­de­pen­dent tai­lors alike fell into a mask-mak­ing frenzy, sewing cup-shaped cre­ations in var­i­ous fab­rics to cater to con­sumer de­mand and whimsy.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­one from Uniqlo to Louis Vuit­ton now re­tails face masks. Sports brands, too, jumped on the band­wagon, with Asics (above right) and Un­der Ar­mour cre­at­ing sports masks that prom­ise a com­fort­able, safe ex­pe­ri­ence ex­er­cis­ing with a mask on.</p>
    <p>In the beauty space, skin­care and cos­metic com­pa­nies piv­oted to ad­dress new skin con­cerns (read: “maskne”, or mask-in­duced acne) and fo­cused more on make-up above the mouth.</p>
    <p>One com­pany – Dr TWL Bio­ma­te­ri­als run by lo­cal der­ma­tol­o­gist Dr Teo Wan Lin – fash­ioned its own masks in a patented, an­timi­cro­bial fab­ric said to ac­tively pre­vent maskne and photo age­ing, or pre­ma­ture skin age­ing caused by prolonged sun ex­po­sure.</p>
    <p>In­con­ve­nient as it may be, mask­ing up has en­cour­aged in­no­va­tion and led to an en­tirely new mar­ket of mask para­pher­na­lia.</p>
    <p>En­ter mask chains and lan­yards to help you go hands-free when din­ing out; head­bands with but­tons for at­tach­ing ear loops; and mask pouches and stor­age cases to keep your mask clean.</p>
    <p>Masks them­selves got more cre­ative. There were the kooky cre­ations, like masks with dis­creet holes to slip in a bub­ble tea straw.</p>
    <p>More were use­ful, cre­ated to ad­dress needs from spe­cific com­mu­ni­ties: mask ex­ten­ders for those wear­ing hi­jabs; and face masks with plas­tic see-through pan­els at the mouth, to aid lip-read­ing for the deaf.</p>
    <p>Feel­ing breath­less yet? Brace your­self – masks are not go­ing any­where, and new cre­ations are sure to keep com­ing even in the new year.</p>
