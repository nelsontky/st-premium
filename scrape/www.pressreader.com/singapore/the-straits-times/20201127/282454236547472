    <p>• Manch­ester City man­ager Pep Guardi­ola has backed his at­tack­ing play­ers to hit top gear af­ter seal­ing qual­i­fi­ca­tion to the Cham­pi­ons League last 16 with a 1-0 win at Olympiakos on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>City have scored 10 goals in four Euro­pean games this sea­son, as many as they have man­aged in eight Premier League matches.</p>
    <p>But the Spa­niard said he had seen enough in the clash in Greece to sug­gest they were im­prov­ing and would carry over their con­ti­nen­tal scor­ing form to the English top flight, start­ing with Burn­ley at the Eti­had to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>His team dom­i­nated pos­ses­sion for long spells be­fore Phil Fo­den fin­ished off a bril­liant team move in the 36th minute to se­cure the vic­tory and main­tain their perfect record in Group C.</p>
    <p>“We were much more ag­gres­sive to the goal. It’s not easy when there are nine play­ers de­fend­ing. Ev­ery­one was so com­mit­ted and we at­tacked with more de­sire to shoot, to score,” Guardi­ola told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“Un­for­tu­nately, we could only score one goal but the team is alive... We would love to do more, but one day, it will come and we’ll break ev­ery­thing.</p>
    <p>“We came here to get to the last 16 and we are there again, an­other year. Now we re­cover as quick as pos­si­ble and start fo­cus­ing on the Premier League.”</p>
    <p>Join­ing City, who have reached the knock­out stage for the eighth straight cam­paign, in the next round are ti­tle hold­ers Bay­ern Mu­nich.</p>
    <p>The six-time Euro­pean Cup win­ners sealed their berth af­ter beat­ing RB Salzburg 3-1 in Group A, pre­serv­ing their 100 per cent start in the Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>Robert Le­wandowski – with his 71st goal in the com­pe­ti­tion, Kings­ley Co­man and sub­sti­tute Leroy Sane put the Aus­tri­ans to bed, al­though the vis­i­tors pushed the Bavar­ian giants hard af­ter Span­ish mid­fielder Marc Roca was sent off af­ter the break.</p>
    <p>“We didn’t play well in the first half. Things changed with the sec­ond half. De­spite the sending-off we played well. I am very sat­is­fied with our ef­fi­ciency,” said Bay­ern coach Hansi Flick.</p>
