    <p>A wo­man was charged yes­ter­day with ex­po­sure and aban­don­ment of a child below 12 years old after a new­born boy was found in Tai Keng Gar­dens near Up­per Paya Le­bar Road on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>She is said to be the in­fant’s mother and is ac­cused of com­mit­ting the of­fence at around 5pm that day.</p>
    <p>The 29-year-old In­done­sian was ar­rested on Wednes­day and can­not be named due to a gag or­der to pro­tect the child’s iden­tity.</p>
    <p>A res­i­dent who wanted to be known only as Mr Lew had ear­lier told The Straits Times that his sonin-law heard the in­fant shortly after a fam­ily din­ner on Mon­day evening.</p>
    <p>Mr Lew said: “He heard a strange noise com­ing from the re­cy­cling bin, and asked some of us for help to check it out. No one dared to open the bin be­cause they thought it might be a cat or a dog, so they called me for help.”</p>
    <p>After lift­ing the lid, Mr Lew said, he spot­ted the in­fant, wrapped in a towel and placed in­side pa­per bags. The po­lice were alerted soon after.</p>
    <p>His fam­ily man­aged to carry the baby out of the bin and an am­bu­lance ar­rived at the scene min­utes later.</p>
    <p>The baby was then rushed to KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Po­lice had ear­lier said he had no vis­i­ble in­juries and his con­di­tion was sta­ble.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on Wednes­day, po­lice said: “Through ex­ten­sive ground in­ves­ti­ga­tions and with the aid of im­ages from CCTV footage pro­vided by res­i­dents, of­fi­cers from the Ang Mo Kio Po­lice Di­vi­sion es­tab­lished the iden­tity of the wo­man, who is be­lieved to have aban­doned the baby.</p>
    <p>“The po­lice would like to ex­press our ap­pre­ci­a­tion to the mem­bers of the com­mu­nity who pro­vided valu­able in­for­ma­tion which aided in­ves­ti­ga­tions and con­trib­uted to the ar­rest.”</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cers are also look­ing into the iden­tity of the baby’s fa­ther.</p>
    <p>The wo­man’s bail was set at $20,000 yes­ter­day and her case has been ad­journed to Aug 13.</p>
    <p>If con­victed of the of­fence, she can be jailed for up to seven years and fined.</p>
