    <p>MANAMA • The Schu­macher name will re­turn to For­mula One next sea­son with Mick, son of Fer­rari great and seven-time world cham­pion Michael, an­nounced yes­ter­day as a race driver for the USowned Haas team.</p>
    <p>The 21-year-old Ger­man, who has signed a multi-year deal, is lead­ing the For­mula Two cham­pi­onship ahead of this week­end’s fi­nale at Bahrain’s Sakhir cir­cuit.</p>
    <p>“The prospect of be­ing on the For­mula One grid next year makes me in­cred­i­bly happy and I’m sim­ply speech­less,” said Schu­macher. “I have al­ways be­lieved that I would re­alise my dream of For­mula One.”</p>
    <p>Schu­macher, a mem­ber of the Fer­rari young driver academy, will form an all-new line-up at Haas along with Rus­sian Nikita Mazepin, whose sign­ing was an­nounced on Tues­day. The pair re­place French­man Ro­main Gros­jean, re­cov­er­ing from a fiery crash in the Bahrain Grand Prix last Sun­day, and Den­mark’s Kevin Mag­nussen.</p>
    <p>Schu­macher will be in the car next week for Fri­day’s first prac­tice at the sea­son-end­ing Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.</p>
    <p>“The For­mula Two Cham­pi­onship has long served as a prov­ing ground for tal­ent to show­case their cre­den­tials and this year’s field has un­doubt­edly been one of the most com­pet­i­tive in re­cent sea­sons,” said Haas prin­ci­pal Gun­ther Steiner. “I firmly be­lieve he’s earned the op­por­tu­nity to grad­u­ate into For­mula One based on his per­for­mances.”</p>
    <p>Schu­macher has a 14-point lead in the F2 stand­ings with the fi­nal week­end’s two races to go. His father re­tired in 2012 af­ter a three­sea­son come­back with Mercedes.</p>
    <p>The Fer­rari great has not been seen in pub­lic since suf­fer­ing se­vere head in­juries in a ski­ing ac­ci­dent in the French Alps in 2013.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Bri­tain’s Ge­orge Rus­sell will stand in for Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes for Sun­day’s Sakhir Grand Prix af­ter be­ing re­leased by Wil­liams, both teams an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Hamilton, who has al­ready clinched his sev­enth world cham­pi­onship, has been ruled out af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Wil­liams said re­serve driver, Bri­tain’s Jack Aitken, will make his F1 de­but as Rus­sell’s re­place­ment along­side Cana­dian reg­u­lar Ni­cholas Lat­ifi.</p>
    <p>I have al­ways be­lieved that I would re­alise my dream of For­mula One.</p>
