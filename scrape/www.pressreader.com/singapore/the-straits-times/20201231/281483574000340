    <p>The Sin­ga­porean man who spied on the United States for China was ar­rested by the In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity Depart­ment (ISD) yes­ter­day upon his re­turn to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Dick­son Yeo Jun Wei, 39, was sen­tenced to 14 months’ jail in the US for spy­ing. He had re­vealed to in­ves­ti­ga­tors there that his “pre­vi­ous in­tel­li­gence task­ings tar­geted other states apart from the US”, said the ISD in a re­lease yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The ISD will in­ter­view Yeo to es­tab­lish if he had en­gaged in “ac­tiv­i­ties prej­u­di­cial to Sin­ga­pore’s se­cu­rity”.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore will not al­low our na­tion­als to be sub­verted or used by any for­eign ac­tors for ac­tiv­i­ties prej­u­di­cial to our se­cu­rity and na­tional in­ter­ests,” said the depart­ment.</p>
    <p>“The Govern­ment takes a very se­ri­ous view of any Sin­ga­porean who en­ters into a clan­des­tine re­la­tion­ship with a for­eign govern­ment and en­gages in es­pi­onage or sub­ver­sive ac­tiv­i­ties at the be­hest of the for­eign power,” it said.</p>
    <p>The ISD added that such in­di­vid­u­als will be firmly dealt with.</p>
    <p>It can­not pro­vide any fur­ther in­for­ma­tion as in­ves­ti­ga­tions are still un­der way.</p>
    <p>The ISD also said that pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures are in place to en­sure there is early de­tec­tion, in­fec­tion control and safe dis­tanc­ing in the fa­cil­ity where Yeo is be­ing held.</p>
    <p>“Pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures were taken dur­ing the ar­rest process to safe­guard the health of per­son­nel in­volved,” said the depart­ment, adding that Yeo was still sub­ject to the “pre­vail­ing bor­der control re­quire­ments” when he ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In July, Yeo pleaded guilty to ob­tain­ing sen­si­tive in­for­ma­tion from Amer­i­cans un­der the di­rec­tion of Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>He had main­tained that he was sup­port­ive of the Chi­nese “cause”, even to­wards the end of his court hear­ings and he claimed that he did not “be­tray Sin­ga­pore”.</p>
    <p>He spied on the US for four years,</p>
    <p>SAFE­GUARD­ING NA­TIONAL IN­TER­ESTS</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore will not al­low our na­tion­als to be sub­verted or used by any for­eign ac­tors for ac­tiv­i­ties prej­u­di­cial to our se­cu­rity and na­tional in­ter­ests... The Govern­ment takes a very se­ri­ous view of any Sin­ga­porean who en­ters into a clan­des­tine re­la­tion­ship with a for­eign govern­ment and en­gages in es­pi­onage or sub­ver­sive ac­tiv­i­ties at the be­hest of the for­eign power.</p>
    <p>after be­ing re­cruited by Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence of­fi­cials in 2015. At that time, he had gone to Bei­jing for a pre­sen­ta­tion on the po­lit­i­cal situation in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Yeo was then a PhD stu­dent at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Pol­icy. He was tasked by Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence to spot and as­sess Amer­i­can cit­i­zens, in­clud­ing US mil­i­tary and govern­ment em­ploy­ees, who had ac­cess to valu­able non-public in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Yeo ad­mit­ted that he paid Amer­i­can cit­i­zens to write re­ports that he then sent to the Chi­nese govern­ment with­out the writ­ers’ knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>He set up a fake po­lit­i­cal con­sul­tancy to do so and trawled through so­cial net­work­ing sites to find his tar­gets.</p>
    <p>He was caught and ar­rested in the US in Novem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>After news broke of Yeo’s ar­rest, China de­nied re­cruit­ing him as a spy and ac­cused the US of hav­ing reached “a state of ex­treme sus­pi­cion”.</p>
    <p>Yeo’s PhD can­di­da­ture was ter­mi­nated when the school learnt of his es­pi­onage ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The ISD said it has in­formed Yeo’s fam­ily mem­bers of his ar­rest and that the depart­ment is in con­tact with them, should they need any as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>How­ever, as it is still in­ves­ti­gat­ing Yeo, he may be de­nied calls and vis­its, said the ISD.</p>
