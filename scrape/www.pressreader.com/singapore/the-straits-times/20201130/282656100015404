    <p>QIam al­ways forced to go with my par­ents when they visit their friends as they say their friends have not seen me for a long time. I get bored go­ing to such vis­its be­cause while my par­ents catch up with their friends, my sis­ter and I just sit there. We have quar­relled a few times over this with my par­ents. Am I be­ing re­bel­lious or is my re­quest a rea­son­able one? Bul­lied</p>
    <p>A Dear</p>
    <p>Bul­lied,</p>
    <p>Like most par­ents, yours are proud of you and wish to show you off on these oc­ca­sions. How­ever, af­ter the ini­tial so­cial in­tro­duc­tions, you and your sis­ter are left to your own de­vices, which gen­er­ally means keep­ing your­self oc­cu­pied for the du­ra­tion of the vis­its.</p>
    <p>Ar­gu­ing only re­flects your re­sis­tance, which may re­sult in your par­ents see­ing you as un­rea­son­able. This might be neg­a­tive com­mu­ni­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>None­the­less, it may be time to ne­go­ti­ate with your par­ents – in a con­struc­tive way – about al­ter­na­tive op­tions. Here are some sug­ges­tions. 1. Find an op­por­tu­nity to dis­cuss the mat­ter with your par­ents. For in­stance, af­ter din­ner when ev­ery­one is re­lax­ing, watch­ing tele­vi­sion and in a good mood. Or bring it up at a struc­tured fam­ily meet­ing time.</p>
    <p>Three main rules for dis­cus­sion:</p>
    <p>• Each party is al­lowed to be heard and not be in­ter­rupted;</p>
    <p>• Each party is given a spe­cific time to talk, maybe 30 min­utes; • No rais­ing of voices or stomp­ing out of the dis­cus­sion.</p>
    <p>2. In­stead of sim­ply say­ing no to the vis­its, come up with log­i­cal or ra­tio­nal points to con­vince your par­ents, such as, that you can use the time bet­ter to re­vise your school­work or en­gage in a hobby that you pre­fer.</p>
    <p>3. Con­sider pos­si­ble al­ter­na­tives. For ex­am­ple, find a com­pro­mise on the num­ber of vis­its within a time­frame or ask if your sis­ter and you need not be re­quired to stay for the en­tire du­ra­tion of the visit.</p>
    <p>4. Take lots of pic­tures of your­self and your sis­ter for your par­ents’ wal­lets or smart­phones. They could use these to show you off in­stead of hav­ing you turn up per­son­ally.</p>

    <p>The Straits Times. This ex­cerpt first ap­peared in Dr Delin­quent: A Guide To De­cod­ing The Teenage Years. The book is avail­able at stbooks.sg</p>
