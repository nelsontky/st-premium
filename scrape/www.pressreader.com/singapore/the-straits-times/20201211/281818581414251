    <p>OT­TAWA • Canada has be­come only the sec­ond Western coun­try to ap­prove a coro­n­avirus vac­cine, a week after Bri­tain did so and with US reg­u­la­tors set to meet yes­ter­day to con­sider tak­ing that step, open­ing up the pos­si­bil­ity that Cana­di­ans will start be­ing in­oc­u­lated next week.</p>
    <p>Lib­eral Prime Min­is­ter Justin Trudeau said in Par­lia­ment that it was “a good day for Cana­di­ans”.</p>
    <p>“We will see 30,000 vac­cines be­gin to ar­rive next week, with many more on the hori­zon, but... we’ve got a tough win­ter to get through,” Mr Trudeau said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Gen­eral in­oc­u­la­tions for all Cana­di­ans will be­gin in April after pri­or­ity pop­u­la­tions are taken care of, the gov­ern­ment said in a vac­ci­na­tion plan re­leased the same day.</p>
    <p>The nation is now “well-po­si­tioned to im­mu­nise 100 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion in 2021”, the plan said, while a sep­a­rate ta­ble dis­trib­uted by the Health Min­istry said im­mu­ni­sa­tion could be com­pleted by the end of Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­la­tory agency Health Canada on Wed­nes­day ap­proved the same vac­cine, de­vel­oped by Amer­i­can com­pany Pfizer and Ger­man firm BioN­Tech, that was au­tho­rised in Bri­tain and is up for a de­ci­sion in the US.</p>
    <p>Canada’s move marks another mile­stone i n the global fight against a pan­demic that has killed more than 1.5 mil­lion peo­ple, con­tin­ues to spread rapidly and has driven the world into a deep re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>Health Canada said that it had com­pleted a rig­or­ous, in­de­pen­dent re­view of the data from clin­i­cal tri­als on the vac­cine’s safety and ef­fec­tive­ness, which in­volved tens of thou­sands of peo­ple – the same kind of scru­tiny ap­plied by the US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Bahrain ap­proved the same vac­cine last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Ot­tawa’s go-ahead means that Cana­di­ans could re­ceive the vac­cine – which re­quires two doses, weeks apart – be­fore Amer­i­cans do, though Pfizer is based in the United States.</p>
    <p>The first ship­ments to Canada, of 249,000 doses, will come from a plant in Bel­gium, of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>Canada, which has a pop­u­la­tion of 38 mil­lion, has agreed to buy up to 76 mil­lion doses from Pfizer, and 414 mil­lion doses of other po­ten­tial vac­cines from other com­pa­nies, but the roll-out will take months.</p>
    <p>As of Tues­day, Canada had re­ported 429,035 to­tal cases, an in­crease of 5,981 on the day be­fore, and 12,867 deaths.</p>
