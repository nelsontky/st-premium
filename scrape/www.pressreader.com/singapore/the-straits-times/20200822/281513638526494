    <p>For­mer United States vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den has ac­cepted the Demo­cratic Party’s nom­i­na­tion to run for pres­i­dent, vow­ing to tackle the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and to bring to­gether a deeply di­vided coun­try un­der­go­ing a national reck­on­ing on race.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, 77, ended the four-day Demo­cratic National Con­ven­tion (DNC) on Thurs­day with a mes­sage of unity and a prom­ise to rep­re­sent all Amer­i­cans if he was elected.</p>
    <p>“His­tory has de­liv­ered us to one of the most dif­fi­cult mo­ments Amer­ica has ever faced,” he said in his ac­cep­tance speech, de­liv­ered live from a con­ven­tion cen­tre in Wilm­ing­ton, Del­a­ware, the state he rep­re­sented as a sen­a­tor from 1973 to 2009.</p>
    <p>“The worst pan­demic in over 100 years. The worst eco­nomic cri­sis since the Great De­pres­sion. The most com­pelling call for racial jus­tice since the ’60s. And the un­de­ni­able re­al­i­ties and ac­cel­er­at­ing threats of cli­mate change,” he said.</p>
    <p>Driv­ing home a mes­sage de­liv­ered mul­ti­ple times over the four days of the DNC, Mr Bi­den said: “This is a life-chang­ing elec­tion that will de­ter­mine Amer­ica’s fu­ture for a very long time. Char­ac­ter is on the bal­lot. Com­pas­sion is on the bal­lot. De­cency, science, democ­racy. They are all on the bal­lot.”</p>
    <p>This year’s DNC was largely vir­tual, fea­tur­ing so­cially dis­tanced speeches and cer­e­monies, and more per­sonal mes­sages from or­di­nary Amer­i­cans and party lead­ers across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>It strove to bring to­gether the Demo­cratic Party’s lib­eral and mod­er­ate wings in op­po­si­tion against Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, while ap­peal­ing to swing vot­ers and dis­af­fected Repub­li­cans not to sit out the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Af­ter two pre­vi­ous un­suc­cess­ful runs for pres­i­dent and a cam­paign that floun­dered in the early stages of the pri­mary con­tests, Mr Bi­den is now the Demo­cratic nom­i­nee and cur­rent front run­ner, with Cal­i­for­nia Sen­a­tor Ka­mala Har­ris as his run­ning mate.</p>
    <p>Re­cent polls place Mr Bi­den be­tween 7 and 11 points ahead of Mr Trump, whose ap­proval rat­ings have been hurt by the protests against racial in­jus­tice this year and his han­dling of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The US leads the world in con­firmed cases and deaths, said Mr Bi­den, adding that as pres­i­dent, he would im­ple­ment mask-wear­ing and other el­e­ments of his national strat­egy, in­clud­ing de­vel­op­ing and rolling out rapid tests.</p>
    <p>Lay­ing out his vi­sion for re­build­ing the US econ­omy, Mr Bi­den promised to in­vest in in­fra­struc­ture and af­ford­able health­care, child­care and el­der­care, boost wages and deal with cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>His ad­min­is­tra­tion would pay for these in­vest­ments by mak­ing the wealth­i­est peo­ple and big­gest cor­po­ra­tions in the US pay their fair share, he said, in a di­rect crit­i­cism of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s tax cuts.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier on Thurs­day, Mr Trump held a rally in Mr Bi­den’s birth­place of Scran­ton, Penn­syl­va­nia, call­ing his op­po­nent “a pup­pet of the rad­i­cal left”.</p>
    <p>“If you want a vi­sion of your life un­der a Joe Bi­den pres­i­dency, imag­ine the smoul­der­ing ru­ins of Min­neapo­lis, the vi­o­lent an­ar­chy of Portland and the blood­stained side­walks of Chicago com­ing to ev­ery city and town in Amer­ica,” said Mr Trump, re­fer­ring to protests in the Demo­crat-led ci­ties that took place dur­ing his pres­i­dency, as well as gang-re­lated vi­o­lence in Chicago.</p>
    <p>The DNC fea­tured many re­but­tals of Mr Trump’s char­ac­ter and poli­cies. Mil­i­tary vet­eran and Illi­nois Sen­a­tor Tammy Duck­worth, whose legs were am­pu­tated af­ter she was in­jured in the Iraq War, slammed Mr Trump as a “coward-in-chief” who was un­sup­port­ive of US troops and weak against ad­ver­saries.</p>
    <p>In brief re­marks on for­eign pol­icy, Mr Bi­den said he would stand with the US’ al­lies and friends and “make it clear to our ad­ver­saries the days of cosy­ing up to dic­ta­tors are over”.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, who would be the old­est pres­i­dent in US his­tory if elected, also ac­knowl­edged the con­cerns of young ac­tivists, from cli­mate change to gun con­trol, and their cries for racial jus­tice and con­dem­na­tion of eco­nomic in­equal­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den re­counted how Mr Trump’s re­fusal to con­demn white su­prem­a­cists at a neo-Nazi rally in Char­lottesvill­e in 2017 spurred him to run for pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>“How­ever it has come to be, Amer­ica is ready to... do the hard work of root­ing out our sys­temic racism,” he said. “In this dark mo­ment, I be­lieve we are poised to make great progress again.”</p>
    <p>A LOT AT STAKE</p>
    <p>His­tory has de­liv­ered us to one of the most dif­fi­cult mo­ments Amer­ica has ever faced. The worst pan­demic in over 100 years.</p>
    <p>The worst eco­nomic cri­sis since the</p>
    <p>Great De­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>The most com­pelling call for racial jus­tice since the ‘60s.</p>
    <p>And the un­de­ni­able re­al­i­ties and ac­cel­er­at­ing threats of cli­mate change... This is a life-chang­ing elec­tion that will de­ter­mine Amer­ica’s fu­ture for a very long time. Char­ac­ter is on the bal­lot. Com­pas­sion is on the bal­lot. De­cency, science, democ­racy.</p>
    <p>They are all on the bal­lot.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>MR JOE BI­DEN, for­mer United States vice-pres­i­dent, in his ac­cep­tance speech, de­liv­ered live from a con­ven­tion cen­tre in Wilm­ing­ton, Del­a­ware, the state he rep­re­sented as a sen­a­tor from 1973 to 2009.</p>
    <p>An un­prej­u­diced view of the United States to­day shows the world’s most pow­er­ful na­tion in a state of dis­ar­ray. It has the largest number of Covid-19 cases and the most deaths, as it faces its worst eco­nomic cri­sis since the Great De­pres­sion and copes with un­re­solved ques­tions on race in­equal­ity that have scarred civic life. If the mood of the na­tion is tense and pes­simistic, its stand­ing in the comity of na­tions is no source of re­as­sur­ance. Re­la­tions with its key trade and busi­ness part­ner China have turned bit­ter to an ex­tent that a con­fronta­tion can­not be com­pletely ruled out. Even al­lies are mis­trust­ful. The pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, some 10 weeks away, is an op­por­tu­nity to pon­der the signs and ad­dress the de­cline.</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic Party can­di­date Joe Bi­den, 77, yes­ter­day made his case for the Oval Of­fice, promis­ing a national pan­demic plan and due at­ten­tion to eco­nomic re­cov­ery and chal­lenges rang­ing from racism to cli­mate change. He pre­sented a steady hand, an em­pa­thetic face, in an ef­fort to draw a con­trast with Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s mer­cu­rial and pug­na­cious style. The for­mer vice-pres­i­dent and vet­eran sen­a­tor has faced ques­tions about his age – he will be the old­est pres­i­dent if elected. And while his track record as a mod­er­ate will be a draw for the in­de­pen­dent vot­ers, it is not en­tirely clear whether the pro­gres­sive wing of his party will have his back.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, 74, will make his pitch to re­new the deal with the elec­torate next week, likely promis­ing to lead a great Amer­i­can come­back. The de­clin­ing un­em­ploy­ment rate bol­sters his case but the chances of a toutable V-shaped growth in time for the Nov 3 elec­tion ap­pear dim.</p>
    <p>His tough stance on China is geared at reviving Amer­ica’s in­dus­trial heart­land, but it is far from cer­tain that his rem­edy will cure Amer­ica’s eco­nomic ills. He has painted Mr Bi­den as be­ing cap­tive to the rad­i­cal left wing of his party and, so far, his own Repub­li­can base is solidly be­hind him – some 85 per cent tell poll­sters they will vote for him. The weak­est link ap­pears to be his ad­min­is­tra­tion’s chaotic han­dling of the pan­demic. But if the US wit­nesses a sus­tained drop in in­fec­tions and the ef­forts to pump re­sources into a vac­cine pay off, he could shape a bet­ter nar­ra­tive.</p>
    <p>In the clos­ing phase of the cam­paign, Mr Bi­den has a clear lead in opin­ion polls. But in the up­com­ing set of pres­i­den­tial de­bates, Mr Trump may yet hold sway. As al­ways, the world is pay­ing close at­ten­tion to the race, be­cause the White House oc­cu­pant in the next four years will have a sin­gu­lar role in how se­ri­ous is­sues on the hori­zon – the pan­demic, eco­nomic cri­sis or cli­mate change – are tack­led. But also at stake in this elec­tion are tra­di­tional Amer­i­can val­ues, in­clud­ing the es­pousal of racial equality and a rules-based or­der. For those rea­sons too, this elec­tion may al­ter the course of global af­fairs for years to come.</p>
