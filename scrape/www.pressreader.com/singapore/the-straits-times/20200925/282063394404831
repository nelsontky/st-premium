    <p>DBS PayLah! and Stan­dard Char­tered Bank cus­tomers can now use Google Pay to trans­fer funds di­rectly from their bank ac­counts to any­one reg­is­tered with PayNow.</p>
    <p>DBS Bank and StanChart are the latest banks to of­fer this pay­ment op­tion af­ter OCBC Bank in­tro­duced it in April.</p>
    <p>Through the in­te­gra­tion of Google Pay with funds trans­fer ser­vice PayNow, DBS PayLah!, OCBC and StanChart cus­tomers can link their bank ac­counts to the Google Pay mo­bile app so that pay­ments will be di­rectly deb­ited without need­ing a card.</p>
    <p>Launched in 2017, PayNow lets cus­tomers of nine par­tic­i­pat­ing banks send and re­ceive money from their bank ac­counts us­ing their mo­bile or NRIC num­bers.</p>
    <p>Google Pay users can also pay mer­chants by scan­ning QR codes (SGQR or PayNow QR) or by en­ter­ing a unique en­tity num­ber. Re­cip­i­ents do not need to be on Google Pay.</p>
    <p>Google Pay has a daily trans­fer limit of $2,000, but part­ner banks are al­lowed to set stricter lim­its. For in­stance, StanChart cus­tomers are lim­ited to $1,000, while DBS PayLah! users will be re­stricted by the wal­let limit in their ac­counts. OCBC cus­tomers can make daily trans­fers of up to $2,000 within the app.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers of banks other than DBS, OCBC and StanChart can also use Google Pay to trans­fer funds by link­ing their bank ac­counts through DBS PayLah!. Pre­vi­ously, Google Pay users, like those us­ing Ap­ple Pay and Sam­sung Pay, could pay mer­chants us­ing only their credit cards. Ap­ple Pay and Sam­sung Pay do not sup­port PayNow.</p>
    <p>Mr Pa­trick Teo, Google Pay’s direc­tor of en­gi­neer­ing, said: “We are ex­cited to launch a new Google Pay ex­pe­ri­ence that builds on Sin­ga­pore’s ro­bust pay­ments in­fra­struc­ture – PayNow and SGQR. De­signed and built for Sin­ga­pore­ans, the new Google Pay en­ables a con­sol­i­dated pay­ment solution that is sim­ple, se­cure and help­ful.”</p>
    <p>Google Pay lets users pay for pur­chases at phys­i­cal stores by tap­ping their smart­phones on con­tact­less readers. They can also use Google Pay for MRT and bus rides, as well as on­line pur­chases on web­sites or apps that sup­port the dig­i­tal wal­let.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is the sec­ond mar­ket af­ter In­dia to launch the re­freshed app. Since its in­tro­duc­tion early this year, the tech gi­ant has been grad­u­ally rolling out fea­tures to cater to lo­cal users. In April, Google Pay added an Or­der Food fea­ture to let users or­der take­away or de­liv­ery from lo­cal food and bev­er­age out­lets.</p>
