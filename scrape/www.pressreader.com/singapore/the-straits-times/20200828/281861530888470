    <p>As gov­ern­ments across the world con­tinue to bat­tle the coro­n­avirus, most peo­ple be­lieve their coun­tries have done well in stem­ming the out­break, ac­cord­ing to a sur­vey of 14 ad­vanced economies by think-tank Pew Re­search Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Over­all, a me­dian of 73 per cent of re­spon­dents said their gov­ern­ments have done a good job in han­dling the coro­n­avirus, which has in­fected more than 24 mil­lion peo­ple world­wide and re­sulted in over 825,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>Just 27 per cent be­lieved their coun­tries have han­dled the pan­demic poorly.</p>
    <p>The data was ob­tained from a na­tion­ally rep­re­sen­ta­tive sur­vey of 14,276 adults from 14 ad­vanced economies, con­ducted by phone from June 10 to Aug 3. The coun­tries are the United States, Canada,</p>
    <p>Bel­gium, Den­mark, France, Ger­many, Italy, the Nether­lands, Spain, Swe­den, the United King­dom, Aus­tralia, Ja­pan and South Korea.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Pew Re­search found that peo­ple in the US and the UK were di­vided in their be­liefs when it comes to rat­ing their gov­ern­ment’s re­sponse to the pan­demic. Th­ese two na­tions also have high lev­els of po­lit­i­cal po­lar­i­sa­tion on views of the gov­ern­ment’s han­dling of this cri­sis.</p>
    <p>In the US, 76 per cent of Repub­li­cans and in­de­pen­dents who lean to­wards the Repub­li­can Party said the gov­ern­ment has done a good job, while just a quar­ter of Democrats and Demo­cratic sup­port­ers agreed – a 51 per­cent­age point dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>In the UK, 55 per cent of rightlean­ing Bri­tons gave a pos­i­tive rat­ing for the coun­try’s han­dling of the pan­demic, led by Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son’s Con­ser­va­tive gov­ern­ment, but just 26 per cent on the left thought the same.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey also found that a me­dian of 58 per cent said the pan­demic has changed their life, while 42 per cent re­ported not too much change or none at all.</p>
    <p>About two-thirds or more in</p>
    <p>South Korea, Swe­den, the US, the UK, Ja­pan and Canada said their lives have changed at least a fair amount due to the pan­demic, with at least three in 10 in South Korea, the US, Swe­den and the UK say­ing that their lives have changed a great deal since the out­break be­gan.</p>
    <p>In six coun­tries – the Nether­lands, Aus­tralia, France, Bel­gium, Ger­many and Den­mark – about half of the re­spon­dents said their lives have not changed much or at all since the on­set of the virus.</p>
    <p>There is lit­tle con­sen­sus among those sur­veyed in the 14 coun­tries on whether the pan­demic has brought peo­ple to­gether, with a me­dian of 46 per cent say­ing their coun­try is more united and 48 per cent think­ing oth­er­wise.</p>
    <p>But in the US, where a patch­work of coro­n­avirus-re­lated re­stric­tions re­flects broad dis­agree­ment over the best path to economic recovery while mit­i­gat­ing the spread of the virus, roughly three-quar­ters said that the US is more di­vided than be­fore. Only about two in 10 Amer­i­cans said the coun­try has be­come more united.</p>
    <p>By con­trast, nearly three-quar</p>
    <p>As global Covid-19 cases show no signs of abat­ing, an av­er­age of 59 per cent of re­spon­dents said in­fec­tions could have been min­imised through stronger in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion, while 36 per cent said such co­op­er­a­tion would have been fu­tile.</p>
    <p>ters in Den­mark said there is more unity now, while more than half in Canada, Swe­den, South Korea and Aus­tralia also said their coun­tries have be­come more united.</p>
    <p>As global Covid-19 cases show no signs of abat­ing, an av­er­age of 59 per cent of re­spon­dents said in­fec­tions could have been min­imised through stronger in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion, while 36 per cent said such co­op­er­a­tion would have been fu­tile.</p>
    <p>The missed chances for co­op­er­a­tion are felt es­pe­cially strongly in Europe, with more than half sur­veyed in Bel­gium, the UK, Spain, France, the Nether­lands, Swe­den and Italy say­ing more co­op­er­a­tion would have re­duced coro­n­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>Some 58 per cent of Amer­i­can adults also said that if the US had co­op­er­ated with more coun­tries, the num­ber of in­fected Amer­i­cans would have been lower.</p>
