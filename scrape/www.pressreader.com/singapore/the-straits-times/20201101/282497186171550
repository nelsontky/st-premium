    <p>GLEN TAY AND ALEX PHAN, both 33 AV­ENUE 87 av­enue87.sg</p>
    <p>Th­ese friends, both grad­u­ates of Shatec, be­came chefs at age 22. For the last 11 years, they have worked for other peo­ple; at restau­rants such as The Tip­pling Club, Sor­rel and Em­ber.</p>
    <p>In fact, Tay is still work­ing at Ul­tra­vi­o­let, French chef Paul Pairet’s avant garde restau­rant in Shang­hai. He is due home next March.</p>
    <p>Un­til that hap­pens, he and Phan col­lab­o­rate on the menu for their restau­rant in Amoy Street, which opened in Septem­ber, via WeChat. It is la­bo­ri­ous. They mea­sure ev­ery­thing to the last gram, so they can each repli­cate dishes and el­e­ments of dishes ex­actly, and they both de­cide what they should add or take away.</p>
    <p>It helps that they have known each other a long time, know each other’s strengths and can fig­ure out what the other thinks.</p>
    <p>Tay tells The Sun­day Times via WeChat: “I run with my heart. Alex is very good at the busi­ness side of things. I’m just start­ing to see the num­bers, how the money is flow­ing.”</p>
    <p>Phan adds: “A lot of chefs know how to run restau­rants, but fail be­cause they can’t man­age ex­penses.”</p>
    <p>Both know Av­enue 87 is the chance for them to put out the kind of food they have dreamt of while work­ing for oth­ers. Their Sin­ga­porean in­vestor, who ap­proached Tay in Shang­hai in 2018, gives them carte blanche.</p>
    <p>Phan says: “Our food is lit­er­ally like Sin­ga­pore – multi-racial; fa­mil­iar flavours us­ing Euro­pean tech­niques.”</p>
    <p>The price is friendly too, a six-course meal costs $98. Their open­ing menu fea­tures a fish soup, with a deeply flavoured broth, lo­cally grown seabass, egg floss, com­pressed bit­ter­gourd and semi-dried toma­toes. It looks like the fa­mil­iar hawker sta­ple, right down to the milk­i­ness, but tastes more re­fined.</p>
    <p>One of the side dishes to go with the main course is an aro­matic bas­mati rice pi­laf with a dis­tinct biryani vibe. An­other op­tion is a savoury mashed potato mixed with yam, a new way of look­ing at orh nee, the Teochew yam dessert.</p>
    <p>Phan says when he asks din­ers for feed­back, he re­ally wants to know what they think. “Some chefs ask but don’t take ac­tion,” he says. He gives the ex­am­ple of how he de­cided to sea­son the raw salmon in one of the cour­ses with red Kam­pot pep­per­corns af­ter get­ting feed­back from cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>“We are con­stantly tweak­ing,” he says.</p>
    <p>Their food is find­ing favour with din­ers, who, in very un-Sin­ga­porean fash­ion, are open about giv­ing them feed­back. Phan says: “A cou­ple who dined here wrote us a note, say­ing it might be their last meal at our restau­rant be­cause next year we might have a star.”</p>
    <p>But he is de­ter­mined to in­vite them back when the menu changes, since get­ting Miche­lin stars is not on the list of pri­or­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Tay says: “My goal is to feed peo­ple, and see­ing the smile on their faces when they en­joy the food. I’m not chas­ing stars.”</p>
    <p>He is also well aware of what is at stake.</p>
    <p>“We are ob­vi­ously very brand new, and our names are on the line. We have al­ways worked for peo­ple, now we are on our own.”</p>
