    <p>The reg­u­la­tory au­thor­i­ties are gear­ing up for a del­uge of peo­ple re­port­ing side ef­fects when the new Covid-19 vac­cines go into use. Even if the vac­cines prove safe – a rea­son­able as­sump­tion based on cur­rent in­for­ma­tion – man­ag­ing the re­port­ing and fol­low-up of what are known as ad­verse drug re­ac­tions will be crit­i­cal to keep­ing to the high lev­els of pub­lic par­tic­i­pa­tion needed for a vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme to be suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>The United States Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion plans to send daily texts to those who are vac­ci­nated for the first week and then weekly texts for six weeks, while the Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion will also be mon­i­tor­ing side ef­fects in real time.</p>
    <p>It’s not clear if Bri­tain’s mon­i­tor­ing sys­tem will have sim­i­lar ca­pa­bil­i­ties by the time the vac­cine is rolled out. The coun­try’s Medicines and Health­care Prod­ucts Reg­u­la­tory Agency is­sued an ur­gent ten­der no­tice (recorded last month in a Euro­pean Union pub­lic pro­cure­ment jour­nal) for an ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence soft­ware tool to help deal with the ex­pected high vol­ume of re­ported ef­fects. (The roughly US$2 mil­lion, or</p>
    <p>S$2.7 mil­lion, con­tract went to out­sourc­ing firm Gen­pact.)</p>
    <p>The agency didn’t mince words in ex­plain­ing the rea­sons for the ur­gency: Its legacy sys­tem would be over­whelmed by the vol­ume of re­ports and could not be retro­fit­ted to cope with the new vac­cine. The ab­sence of a new tool would “hin­der its abil­ity to rapidly iden­tify any po­ten­tial safety is­sues within the Covid-19 vac­cine”.</p>
    <p>That, in turn, would rep­re­sent a “di­rect threat to pa­tient life and pub­lic health”.</p>
    <p>Even if the lan­guage may have been partly crafted to ex­empt it from nor­mal EU ten­der re­quire­ments, it un­der­scores what’s at stake for gov­ern­ments around the world as these brand new vac­cines are rolled out with un­prece­dented speed to a far wider pub­lic than ever be­fore.</p>
    <p>As with any new drug, the range of these ad­verse drug re­ac­tions (ADRs) – un­in­tended, harm­ful events linked to the med­i­ca­tion – will be known only when a very large num­ber of peo­ple have been vac­ci­nated. A re­ported ad­verse ef­fect doesn’t mean a vac­cine isn’t safe, and in some cases, it may not be re­lated to the in­oc­u­la­tion at all. But ADRs help doc­tors, phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies and reg­u­la­tors mon­i­tor the im­pact of li­censed drugs. They can iden­tify mis­use of a drug, com­pro­mised batches or sim­ply side ef­fects that need to be dis­closed even if it doesn’t change the safety pro­file.</p>
    <p>Ef­fec­tive mon­i­tor­ing is es­pe­cially im­por­tant, given that these vac­cines will be re­leased with less safety fol­low-up than is typ­i­cal for widely used shots. Hav­ing a ro­bust sys­tem to log, an­a­lyse and al­low for prompt feed­back from re­ported side ef­fects is es­sen­tial to en­sur­ing pub­lic safety. Com­bined with clear com­mu­ni­ca­tion, it will also be cen­tral to build­ing con­fi­dence in the new vac­cines.</p>
    <p>In general, most side ef­fects ap­pear soon af­ter an in­jec­tion and re­main only for a short pe­riod. A small per­cent­age of peo­ple will ex­pe­ri­ence them from any well-es­tab­lished vac­cine, or even your typ­i­cal pain re­lief med­i­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Most peo­ple are will­ing to ac­cept that small level of risk for mas­sive ben­e­fit – to their chil­dren and pub­lic health gen­er­ally – from vac­ci­na­tion pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s Yel­low Card sys­tem might re­ceive one re­port per 1,000 im­mu­ni­sa­tions. But if you dra­mat­i­cally in­crease the num­ber of peo­ple be­ing vac­ci­nated, the amount of re­ported ef­fects can be ex­pected to in­crease pro­por­tion­ately. With Covid-19 vac­cines likely to go to the old­est and most vul­ner­a­ble first, there may be even more ADRs re­ported than usual.</p>
    <p>Even if they aren’t re­lated to the vac­cine, they can spook the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>The side-ef­fect re­ports have the po­ten­tial to be a gold mine for anti-vaxxers. Vac­cine scep­ti­cism is higher in the United States, but Bri­tain bears the scars of the now thor­oughly de­bunked link­ing of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vac­cine to autism.</p>
    <p>In a sur­vey last week by the Lon­don Assem­bly Health Com­mit­tee, only three in five re­spon­dents said they are likely to or will def­i­nitely get vac­ci­nated; al­most half of those who said they wouldn’t or might not do so cited lack of trust in gov­ern­ment guid­ance or drug com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Such concerns aren’t en­tirely ir­ra­tional. If vac­cines have tra­di­tion­ally taken up to a decade to win ap­proval, peo­ple won­der how can we trust the safety of one pro­duced in a small frac­tion of the time. One an­swer is that in the bat­tle against Covid-19, no ef­fort, brain­power or re­source was spared. That in­tense, global com­pe­ti­tion has borne im­pres­sive fruit. The tech­nol­ogy has also ad­vanced so rapidly that past timeta­bles aren’t a very good guide.</p>
    <p>The so-called mes­sen­ger RNA (ri­bonu­cleic acid) tech­nol­ogy, used by the two lead­ing in­oc­u­la­tion can­di­dates from Moderna and the part­ner­ship of Pfizer and BioNTech, is al­ready rev­o­lu­tion­is­ing vac­cine devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>With all of this in mind, it’s vi­tal gov­ern­ments ed­u­cate the pub­lic about what they might ex­pect. The side-ef­fect pro­files so far seem noth­ing to be con­cerned about. Still, they may be a bit harsher than a typ­i­cal flu shot, which is the only ref­er­ence point most of us have.</p>
    <p>If peo­ple know what to ex­pect, they’ll be less likely to worry or flood hot­lines. These may well be mod­ern-day mir­a­cles, but as the saying goes, vac­cines don’t save lives, vac­ci­na­tions do.</p>
    <p>With vac­cines ex­pected to cover as much as a third of the pop­u­la­tion by the first part of next year, ef­fec­tive mon­i­tor­ing and to­tal trans­parency will be es­sen­tial if we are to de­feat not just this pandemic, but the next one too.</p>
