    <p>WELLING­TON • New Zealand re­ported 13 new com­mu­nity in­fec­tions yesterday as it scram­bled to trace the source of its first coro­n­avirus out­break in more than three months after Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern had sought to erad­i­cate the virus with a hard lock­down.</p>
    <p>The resur­gence of Covid-19 comes just weeks be­fore a sched­uled gen­eral elec­tion, in­creas­ing pres­sure on Ms Ardern to get the out­break un­der con­trol amid grow­ing crit­i­cism.</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern swiftly reim­posed tight move­ment re­stric­tions in Auck­land and so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures across the rest of the coun­try after the dis­cov­ery this week of four in­fected fam­ily mem­bers in the city.</p>
    <p>“Once again we are re­minded of how tricky this virus is and how eas­ily it can spread,” she said dur­ing a tele­vised news con­fer­ence yesterday. “Go­ing hard and early is still the best course of ac­tion.”</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials re­ported 13 new cases in the com­mu­nity, and one over­seas ar­rival who had not left quar­an­tine since ar­riv­ing in the coun­try, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber of ac­tive cases to 36.</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern said it was a pos­i­tive sign that all 13 new com­mu­nity cases were linked to one in­fected fam­ily, ei­ther via work or broader fam­ily con­nec­tions, and that all were be­ing placed in quar­an­tine. She said that ex­pe­ri­ence showed “things will get worse be­fore they get bet­ter”, and more cases were likely to be re­ported in the com­ing days.</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Win­ston Peters said he sus­pected the cause of the out­break came from quar­an­tine, and that con­fir­ma­tion should come soon. “I think there’s been a breach in­side our quar­an­tine sys­tem, and I think, when that comes out very shortly, in a mat­ter of maybe less than a day, we’ll find out that was the case,” he told the Aus­tralian Broad­cast­ing Cor­po­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Peters said he had been in­formed of the de­tails by a New Zealand jour­nal­ist.</p>
    <p>Direc­tor-gen­eral of health Ash­ley Bloom­field said health of­fi­cials were get­ting “closer ev­ery hour” to find­ing pa­tient zero of the out­break.</p>
    <p>Dr Bloom­field had raised the pos­si­bil­ity ear­lier on Wed­nes­day that the virus had ar­rived in New Zealand via freight, given that one of the ini­tially in­fected fam­ily mem­bers works in a cold store that takes im­ported frozen goods from over­seas.</p>
    <p>Ten of the new cases were ei­ther cold store staff or their fam­ily mem­bers. The cold store is op­er­ated by the New Zealand unit of US-based Ameri­cold Realty Trust.</p>
    <p>Yesterday, Dr Bloom­field said that im­port­ing the virus via freight was con­sid­ered “a low pos­si­bil­ity” as the in­fec­tion source, but of­fi­cials wanted to for­mally rule it out. China has re­ported the virus on frozen food pack­aged in South Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>Some prom­i­nent lo­cal health ex­perts sug­gested it was more likely the virus had been qui­etly spread­ing in Auck­land for weeks, de­spite Ms Ardern’s ef­forts to erad­i­cate it with an ini­tial five-week hard lock­down.</p>
    <p>This pos­si­bil­ity has al­lowed the ma­jor op­po­si­tion Na­tional Party to seize on po­ten­tial flaws in Ms Ardern’s ap­proach ahead of the Sept 19 elec­tion, which she de­scribed as a “Covid elec­tion” when launch­ing her cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern is on track to eas­ily win the elec­tion, ac­cord­ing to re­cent polls, but the Na­tional Party is pres­sur­ing her to de­lay the vote un­til at least Novem­ber, ar­gu­ing that the in­abil­ity to cam­paign gives Ms Ardern an un­fair ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern said she will an­nounce a de­ci­sion on the elec­tion date after she re­veals to­day whether lock­down mea­sures will be ex­tended. The elec­tion must be held by Nov 21.</p>
    <p>In Auck­land, home to around 1.7 mil­lion peo­ple, po­lice set up check­points at the city’s bor­ders as scores of peo­ple at­tempted to leave to avoid a sus­tained lock­down, as Ms Ardern warned they would be turned back.</p>
    <p>Long queues of peo­ple formed at pop-up clin­ics, with some wait­ing hours to be tested for the virus, and there was a rush to su­per­mar­kets to stock up on es­sen­tials.</p>
    <p>There was also grow­ing anger at rev­e­la­tions that mem­bers of the in­fected fam­ily had vis­ited sev­eral tourist sites in the town of Ro­torua and an aged-care home in the Waikato district, both south of Auck­land.</p>
    <p>“We can see the se­ri­ous­ness of the sit­u­a­tion we are in,” Ms Ardern said. “It’s be­ing dealt with in an ur­gent but calm and me­thod­i­cal way.”</p>
    <p>With 1,238 con­firmed cases and 22 deaths, New Zealand’s ex­po­sure to the virus re­mains well below many other de­vel­oped nations.</p>
    <p>Some prom­i­nent lo­cal health ex­perts sug­gested it was more likely the virus had been qui­etly spread­ing in Auck­land for weeks, de­spite Ms Ardern’s ef­forts to erad­i­cate it with an ini­tial five-week hard lock­down. This pos­si­bil­ity has al­lowed the ma­jor op­po­si­tion Na­tional Party to seize on po­ten­tial flaws in Ms Ardern’s ap­proach ahead of the Sept 19 polls.</p>
