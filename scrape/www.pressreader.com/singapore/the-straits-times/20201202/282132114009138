    <p>The num­ber of Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents di­ag­nosed with the hu­man im­mun­od­e­fi­ciency virus (HIV) this year is pro­jected to drop be­low 300 for the first time in 17 years.</p>
    <p>From Jan­uary to Oc­to­ber, there were 220 newly di­ag­nosed HIV cases, said the Health Min­istry (MOH) on World Aids Day yes­ter­day. The last time case num­bers dropped be­low 300 was in 2003, when there were 242 cases. Be­tween 2007 and 2017, cases hov­ered in the 400 to 500 range.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors at­tribute the marked re­duc­tion in new HIV cases this year to safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures due to the pan­demic as well as the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod from April to June.</p>
    <p>Dr Colleen Thomas, an in­ter­nal medicine spe­cial­ist at Mount El­iz­a­beth Novena Spe­cial­ist Cen­tre, said: “Fear of Covid-19 caused peo­ple to min­imise so­cial in­ter­ac­tions and ba­si­cally stay home. Gath­er­ings and night life were all af­fected.”</p>
    <p>But in­fec­tious diseases spe­cial­ist Leong Hoe Nam from Mount El­iz­a­beth Novena Hos­pi­tal noted there may have been some in­fected with HIV who opted to forgo test­ing due to the pan­demic, and they would not be re­flected in the fig­ures.</p>
    <p>Said Dr Leong: “There might have been re­duced test­ing this year due to Covid-19. Peo­ple may... have been fright­ened to see a doc­tor or go to hos­pi­tals.”</p>
    <p>Of the 125 cases re­ported in the first half of the year, 90 per cent were male and about four in 10 were aged be­tween 40 and 59.</p>
    <p>Sex­ual in­ter­course re­mains the main mode of HIV trans­mis­sion, ac­count­ing for 96 per cent of the 125 cases.</p>
    <p>Mr Rayner Tan, a doc­toral can­di­date at the Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, who has con­ducted re­search on HIV and sex­u­ally trans­mit­ted in­fec­tions, noted a steeper drop in yearly cases af­ter 2017, at­tribut­ing it to the roll-out of the new HIV pre­ven­tive drug – HIV pre-ex­po­sure pro­phy­laxis (PrEP) – in late 2016.</p>
    <p>The an­tiretro­vi­ral med­i­ca­tion is taken by HIV-neg­a­tive in­di­vid­u­als to pre­vent HIV in­fec­tion. Since 2018, yearly cases have hov­ered in the low 300 range, down dras­ti­cally from 434 cases in 2017.</p>
    <p>“Re­search un­der­pinned both the ef­fi­cacy of PrEP, as well as its ac­cept­abil­ity and higher up­take among ho­mo­sex­ual and bi­sex­ual men,” said Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>“If we are able to scale up ac­cess to HIV PrEP, our mod­el­ling stud­ies at the school sug­gest that it is pos­si­ble to elim­i­nate the on­ward trans­mis­sion of HIV as early as 2030.”</p>
    <p>More than half the cases re­ported this year were de­tected by HIV tests done in the course of med­i­cal care, while 15 per cent of cases were de­tected through vol­un­tary HIV screen­ing, down from 19 per cent last year.</p>
    <p>MOH and the Health Pro­mo­tion Board urged in­di­vid­u­als at risk of HIV in­fec­tion to un­dergo reg­u­lar test­ing.</p>
    <p>“With early and ef­fec­tive treat­ment, per­sons liv­ing with HIV can de­lay the on­set of ac­quired im­mune de­fi­ciency syn­drome (Aids) for many years and con­tinue to lead an ac­tive and pro­duc­tive life,” said the min­istry.</p>
