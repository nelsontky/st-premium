    <p>The bright colours and smells of the Sin­ga­pore Food Expo will be missed this year as the Sin­ga­pore Food Man­u­fac­tur­ers’ As­so­ci­a­tion (SFMA) will hold the an­nual event on­line on a smaller scale due to the coronaviru­s outbreak. But busi­nesses and the public can check out the var­i­ous prod­ucts on a cen­tralised por­tal and on Face­book live shows.</p>
    <p>With just 52 ven­dors, down from the 104 ven­dors with 147 booths last year, the event from Oct 5 to Nov 1 will fo­cus on help­ing Sin­ga­porean food man­u­fac­tur­ers dig­i­talise their busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>SFMA has part­nered e-com­merce web­site Sin­ga­pore Food United to en­able man­u­fac­tur­ers to sell their prod­ucts on­line. The web­site has a min­i­mum spend­ing of $40 for each brand and a $1.50 flat de­liv­ery charge, said SFMA.</p>
    <p>There will also be Face­book live shows and posts where the prod­ucts will be show­cased by Sin­ga­pore Home Cooks, an on­line com­mu­nity with more than 220,000 mem­bers. The group will host eight live shows ev­ery Wed­nes­day and Satur­day dur­ing the expo, which is the 21st edi­tion of the an­nual event.</p>
    <p>At the launch event yes­ter­day, where Min­is­ter of State for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth as well as Trade and In­dus­try Low Yen Ling learnt how to cook lo­cal favourite laksa, she also shared her “recipe” for busi­ness trans­for­ma­tion. “I would like to share with you what I think are three key in­gre­di­ents that are nec­es­sary for busi­nesses to trans­form suc­cess­fully: in­no­va­tion, col­lab­o­ra­tion and dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion.”</p>
    <p>Ms Low em­pha­sised the need for man­u­fac­tur­ers to trans­form their busi­nesses due to the outbreak. She cited Sin Mui Heng Food In­dus­tries as a firm that has suc­cess­fully piv­oted to­wards e-com­merce. “At the on­set of Covid-19, the com­pany saw that their pri­mary stream of in­come could come from di­rect con­sumer sales. They were quick to start mar­ket­ing their prod­ucts ag­gres­sively on so­cial me­dia plat­forms and on­line stores, such as Face­book, In­sta­gram and Shopee. These moves en­abled Sin Mui Heng to build a loyal cus­tomer base on­line, and grow its In­ter­net sales by more than 37 times.”</p>
    <p>SFMA pres­i­dent David Tan said: “Most of our mem­bers are still en­gag­ing their cus­tomers di­rectly. The Sin­ga­pore Food United e-com­merce plat­form will help them move on­line with a re­duced de­liv­ery charge.”</p>
    <p>Last year’s Sin­ga­pore Food Expo drew a crowd of 450,000 peo­ple.</p>
