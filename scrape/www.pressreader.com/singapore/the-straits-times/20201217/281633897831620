    <p>Two Sin­ga­pore­ans were among the 12 new coro­n­avirus cases an­nounced by the Min­istry of Health (MOH) last night.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore­ans are a 39-yearold man who re­turned from In­done­sia and a 50-year-old woman who ar­rived from Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>The man showed symp­toms last Satur­day, and was con­firmed pos­i­tive on Tues­day. The woman was asymp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>All the 12 new cases were im­ported and placed on stay-home no­tice on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,353.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the two Sin­ga­pore­ans, the re­main­ing im­ported cases in­clude two per­ma­nent res­i­dents (PRs), four work per­mit hold­ers, two de­pen­dant’s pass hold­ers, a long-term visit pass holder and a short-term visit pass holder.</p>
    <p>The PRs re­turned from Philip­pines and In­dia, while the work per­mit hold­ers, who are cur­rently em­ployed in Sin­ga­pore, ar­rived from In­dia, Myan­mar and In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>There were no new com­mu­nity cases and none in work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with no new cases in the past week.</p>
    <p>With five cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 58,223 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 25 pa­tients re­mained in hos­pi­tals yes­ter­day, with none in in­ten­sive care, and 61 pa­tients were still re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 29 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, the virus out­break, which be­gan in De­cem­ber last year, has in­fected more than 72.8 mil­lion peo­ple. More than 1.6 mil­lion peo­ple have died.</p>
