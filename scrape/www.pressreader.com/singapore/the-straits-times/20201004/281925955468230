    <p>•</p>
    <p>The tragic case of a ru­ral live-streamer who died after be­ing set alight by her for­mer hus­band has trig­gered ou­trage over do­mes­tic vi­o­lence in China.</p>
    <p>The 30-year-old woman, named Lamu, died last Wed­nes­day after ef­forts to save her life failed, ac­cord­ing to a state­ment from po­lice in Sichuan prov­ince’s Jinchuan county.</p>
    <p>She had more than 885,000 fol­low­ers on Douyin – the Chi­nese ver­sion of TikTok – and reg­u­larly posted videos of her daily life for­ag­ing in the moun­tains, cook­ing and lip­sync­ing to songs while dressed in tra­di­tional Ti­betan cloth­ing.</p>
    <p>The po­lice state­ment said Lamu was doused in petrol and set alight at home by her for­mer hus­band, sur­named Tang, on Sept 14. He was de­tained on sus­pi­cion of in­ten­tional homi­cide.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal me­dia re­ported that Tang at­tacked Lamu while she was livestream­ing and that he had a his­tory of do­mes­tic vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>She suf­fered burns to 90 per cent of her body, her sis­ter told the Chengdu Com­mer­cial Daily.</p>
    <p>Lamu’s fans raised one mil­lion yuan (S$201,000) for her hos­pi­tal treat­ment shortly after the at­tack, lo­cal me­dia said.</p>
    <p>Mil­lions of users on the Twit­ter­like plat­form Weibo de­manded justice us­ing the trend­ing hash­tags #Lamu case and #Lamu died after be­ing set on fire by her ex-hus­band – which were later cen­sored.</p>
    <p>“Re­move the ‘In­ter­net celebrity’ la­bel, she is just an or­di­nary woman who un­for­tu­nately suf­fered do­mes­tic vi­o­lence and was abused and threat­ened,” read one com­ment with more than 28,000 likes.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral other high-pro­file cases of do­mes­tic vi­o­lence have sparked an out­cry in China this year, with peo­ple call­ing on law­mak­ers to do more to seek justice for vic­tims.</p>
    <p>In June, a woman from He­nan prov­ince was de­nied a di­vorce after she jumped out of a sec­ond-storey win­dow to es­cape her hus­band’s phys­i­cal abuse, leav­ing her paral­ysed. The court later granted the di­vorce after her case drew na­tion­wide at­ten­tion on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>China crim­i­nalised do­mes­tic vi­o­lence only in 2016, but the is­sue re­mains per­va­sive and un­der-re­ported, es­pe­cially in un­der­de­vel­oped ru­ral com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Ac­tivists are wor­ried that a re­cent change to China’s civil code – which in­tro­duced a manda­tory 30-day “cool­ing off” pe­riod for di­vorc­ing cou­ples – may make it harder for vic­tims to leave abu­sive mar­riages.</p>
