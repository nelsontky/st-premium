    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • LeBron James and An­thony Davis will sit out the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers’ first ex­hi­bi­tion game fol­low­ing the short­est off-sea­son in Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) his­tory, US me­dia re­ported on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The Lak­ers faced the Los An­ge­les Clip­pers yes­ter­day in the first of four ex­hi­bi­tion games ahead of the 2020-21 sea­son, which starts on Dec 22, but the con­test did not in­clude the star duo.</p>
    <p>On the rea­son for “load man­age­ment” even be­fore the term be­gins, Lak­ers coach Frank Vo­gel told the Los An­ge­les Times: “It makes me want to do less live work, ac­tu­ally, just out of con­cern for mak­ing sure our play­ers aren’t put in a sit­u­a­tion where they can be vul­ner­a­ble to in­jury.</p>
    <p>“If your body is not used to play­ing live bas­ket­ball, like you typ­i­cally would be build­ing up to a nor­mal train­ing camp, I think you have to take it slower, do more drill work, try to put your sys­tem in through drill work as much as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“And then, in­tro­duce the live ac­tion at a slower pace to get their bod­ies used to con­tact again.”</p>
    <p>NBA play­ers are get­ting six weeks less rest com­pared to the typ­i­cal off-sea­son and Davis is wary of overex­ert­ing him­self too fast, too soon, par­tic­u­larly as the NBA Fi­nals are ex­pected to con­clude by late July, just be­fore the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.</p>
    <p>“I don’t want to rush into any­thing,” the All-Star for­ward told the LA Times. “We’ve seen, un­for­tu­nately, how (Amer­i­can) foot­ball went with no pre-sea­son, shorter sea­son, and a lot of in­juries hap­pen.</p>
    <p>“You don’t want that same thing. So, I’m go­ing to build up the right way.</p>
    <p>“(Vo­gel) has been do­ing a great job of do­ing that with our team, build­ing up the right way.</p>
    <p>“Coach is al­ready on ev­ery­body about tak­ing care of your body with a shorter sea­son, es­pe­cially with no bub­ble, Covid play­ing a fac­tor. My job is to be on the floor with the team, but also do­ing it the right way.”</p>
    <p>The Lak­ers de­feated the Mi­ami Heat in Game 6 of the NBA Fi­nals on Oct 11 to claim a record-ty­ing 17th cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>They have three more pre-sea­son games, one against the Clip­pers and two against the Phoenix Suns, be­fore open­ing the reg­u­lar sea­son on Dec 22 against the Clip­pers at the Sta­ples Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The other match-up on the first day will see the Golden State War­riors travel to the Brook­lyn Nets.</p>
