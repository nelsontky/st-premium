    <p>Cen­sor­ship in China has in­ten­si­fied in re­cent months, with Bei­jing grap­pling with the Covid-19 pan­demic and in­creas­ingly fraught re­la­tions with the United States.</p>
    <p>A new study by re­searchers at the Univer­sity of Toronto’s Cit­i­zen Lab found that Chi­nese app WeChat blocked 2,174 key­words re­lated to Covid-19 from Jan­uary to May.</p>
    <p>Mi­croblog­ging site Weibo has been block­ing users from post­ing mes­sages sup­port­ing ei­ther Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump or his Demo­cratic chal­lenger, Mr Joe Bi­den, in the up­com­ing US elec­tion.</p>
    <p>A num­ber of in­flu­en­tial WeChat ac­counts have also been deleted af­ter new In­ter­net cen­sor­ship reg­u­la­tions came into ef­fect in March, said one ex­pert on Chi­nese so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>These are just some re­cent ex­am­ples of an on­go­ing Web clampdown by Bei­jing that ex­perts say is part of ef­forts to seize the nar­ra­tive and shift pub­lic un­hap­pi­ness to­wards ad­ver­saries of China like the US.</p>
    <p>In a study re­leased last month, Cit­i­zen Lab out­lined Bei­jing’s cen­sor­ship on Covid-19 from Jan­uary to May, when key words rang­ing from crit­i­cism of the govern­ment to in­for­ma­tion on the virus were blocked.</p>
    <p>In the early days of the pan­demic, Chi­nese cen­sors mostly fo­cused on crit­i­cism of the govern­ment’s re­sponse to the pan­demic and in­for­ma­tion on the new coro­n­avirus, in­clud­ing its po­ten­tial for hu­man-to-hu­man trans­mis­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>As the pan­demic spread glob­ally, cen­sors turned to the in­ter­na­tional re­sponse to Covid-19, global crit­i­cism of China and US-re­lated top­ics.</p>
    <p>The study said cen­sored con­tent showed “ar­eas of sen­si­tiv­ity for the Chi­nese govern­ment from how the virus is con­tained in China, in­ter­na­tional diplo­macy and on­go­ing ten­sions be­tween the US and China”.</p>
    <p>It also said it was ap­par­ent that there had been “of­fi­cial pres­sure” to re­strict in­for­ma­tion since the start of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Another area that cen­sors are be­gin­ning to tar­get is the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese ne­ti­zens no­ticed last month that at­tempt­ing to post mes­sages on Weibo sup­port­ing ei­ther one of the US pres­i­den­tial can­di­dates would lead to a no­tice that such con­tent “con­tra­vened reg­u­la­tions or</p>
    <p>Weibo’s com­mu­nity guide­lines”.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ti­tus Chen from Tai­wan’s Na­tional Sun YatSen Univer­sity, who has stud­ied Chi­nese so­cial me­dia ex­ten­sively, said that apart from Covid-19, one fac­tor that has con­trib­uted to in­ten­si­fy­ing cen­sor­ship is the in­tro­duc­tion of the new In­ter­net con­tent reg­u­la­tions, which came into force in March.</p>
    <p>These reg­u­la­tions – which tar­get vir­tu­ally all In­ter­net users in China, from those who pro­duce con­tent to plat­forms – ban a wide range of ma­te­rial, from pornog­ra­phy to con­tent that would “neg­a­tively im­pact the on­line ecosys­tem”, and re­quires plat­forms or users to delete of­fend­ing con­tent or even close ac­counts.</p>
    <p>Prof Chen said the rules have “fur­ther shack­led Chi­nese so­cial me­dia ac­tors”, adding that he has also no­ticed a num­ber of in­flu­en­tial WeChat ac­counts that have been closed for good.</p>
    <p>“Some pub­lic ac­counts have retroac­tively re­moved or re­vised ar­ti­cles they posted in the past. This is some­thing we’ve not seen be­fore,” he said.</p>
    <p>In the case of Covid-19, Prof Chen said Bei­jing used cen­sor­ship to re­move “in­cen­di­ary, an­tiregime nar­ra­tives”, while its pro­pa­ganda work has rewrit­ten the his­tory of the pan­demic by cheer­lead­ing China’s per­for­mance and shift­ing the blame to its ad­ver­saries.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers have noted how pub­lic un­hap­pi­ness over China’s ini­tial han­dling of Covid-19 has been redi­rected against the US, which in re­cent months has been ex­ert­ing pres­sure on Bei­jing over is­sues rang­ing from trade and tech­nol­ogy to es­pi­onage.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese state me­dia, in par­tic­u­lar, have been re­spon­si­ble for con­tent that has gen­er­ated huge dis­cus­sion on US-re­lated top­ics, said me­dia scholar Fu King-wa from the Univer­sity of Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>But Bei­jing wants state me­dia or of­fi­cial sources to frame such dis­cus­sion, and con­tent run­ning counter to the state nar­ra­tive could at­tract cen­sor­ship, said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Fu. “It’s not al­ways the case that cen­sor­ship is trig­gered be­cause of crit­i­cism of the govern­ment... pub­lic opin­ion must fol­low the state’s di­rec­tions.”</p>
