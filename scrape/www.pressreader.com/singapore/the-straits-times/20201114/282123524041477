    <p>Reg­u­la­tors are not against in­no­va­tion, said Mr Liang Tao, a vice-chair­man of the China Bank­ing and In­sur­ance Reg­u­la­tory Com­mis­sion, but they can­not ig­nore the risks and chal­lenges posed by fin­tech. Digi­ti­sa­tion doesn’t change the fun­da­men­tals of the fi­nan­cial in­dus­try and that means that fi­nan­cial tech­nol­ogy op­er­a­tors should be sub­ject to the same su­per­vi­sion and risk man­age­ment re­quire­ments as banks.</p>
    <p>When China’s rich­est man Jack Ma took on the coun­try’s fi­nan­cial watch­dogs late last month, he knew it was risky and that there could be reper­cus­sions.</p>
    <p>It was a bold but baf­fling move to say the least, with less than two weeks to go be­fore his fin­tech gi­ant Ant Group’s US$37 bil­lion (S$50 bil­lion) ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO) – the world’s largest stock mar­ket de­but.</p>
    <p>The IPO, which has since been sus­pended, would have taken the bil­lion­aire’s for­tune to US$71.1 bil­lion on the Bloomberg Bil­lion­aires In­dex, mak­ing him the world’s 11th rich­est man. There was no ra­tio­nal rea­son to rock the boat. Some ob­servers say Mr Ma was blinded by hubris fol­low­ing the phe­nom­e­nal suc­cess of his busi­ness em­pire and thought he could get away with his open dis­dain for China’s bank­ing sys­tem.</p>
    <p>But oth­ers saw it dif­fer­ently. The re­marks rub­bish­ing China’s big lenders were more of a gam­bit than a gaffe by the 56-year-old co-founder of e-com­merce be­he­moth Alibaba Group Hold­ing – a ma­jor share­holder of Ant – ac­cord­ing to two fi­nan­cial in­dus­try sources who spoke to</p>
    <p>The Straits Times on con­di­tion of anonymity due to the sen­si­tive na­ture of the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Ma usu­ally speaks off the cuff. But on Oct 24, he read from a pre­pared speech at the Bund Sum­mit in Shang­hai, where he took a swipe at China’s out­dated fi­nan­cial and reg­u­la­tory sys­tem for im­ped­ing in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>“China has no sys­temic fi­nan­cial risks be­cause there is no sys­tem... We can­not reg­u­late the fu­ture with yes­ter­day’s means,” he told the fo­rum. He called for re­forms, and likened Chi­nese banks to “pawn­shops” and the Basel Com­mit­tee of global bank­ing reg­u­la­tors to “an old man’s club”.</p>
    <p>“Some say Ma Yun mis­spoke, rais­ing the sen­si­tive is­sue at the wrong place and time,” a vet­eran Chi­nese banker told ST, re­fer­ring to the self-made bil­lion­aire by his</p>
    <p>Chi­nese name.</p>
    <p>“Oth­ers say it was his strat­egy. He was count­ing on a looser reg­u­la­tory en­vi­ron­ment, which would be con­ducive to in­no­va­tion.”</p>
    <p>Those who be­lieve Mr Ma made a cal­cu­lated, if high-risk, gam­ble ar­gue that the flam­boy­ant busi­ness­man is not with­out po­lit­i­cal smarts and knows bet­ter than to gra­tu­itously up­set China’s pow­er­ful fi­nan­cial reg­u­la­tors, es­pe­cially when shar­ing a stage with heavy­weights such as Vice-Pres­i­dent Wang Qis­han and for­mer cen­tral bank gov­er­nor Zhou Xiaochuan.</p>
    <p>For Mr Ma, the crit­i­cism was a means to an end and not an end in it­self. If his aim was to shake up the sta­tus quo, he suc­ceeded, but not in the way he in­tended.</p>
    <p>“He wanted clar­ity from reg­u­la­tory bod­ies on whether Ant is the wife or a mis­tress,” a for­mer cen­tral bank of­fi­cial said, re­fer­ring to Mr Ma’s ar­gu­ment that Ant should be viewed as a tech­nol­ogy com­pany and given more lat­i­tude in its op­er­a­tions, rather than as a tightly reg­u­lated fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>The an­swer came quickly and bru­tally. On Nov 2, the cen­tral bank and the bank­ing, in­sur­ance, se­cu­ri­ties and for­eign ex­change reg­u­la­tors sum­moned Mr Ma and Ant ex­ec­u­tives for a dress­ing down. The mes­sage: The days of loose gov­ern­ment over­sight were over and the on­line lend­ing busi­ness would face tighter scru­tiny. The IPO is­sue did not come up dur­ing the meet­ing.</p>
    <p>That even­ing, the cen­tral bank and the bank­ing watchdog pub­lished draft rules spell­ing out lend­ing caps and ge­o­graph­i­cal curbs. The pro­posed rules also dic­tate that small on­line lenders must pro­vide at least 30 per cent of any loan they jointly fund with do­mes­tic banks in­stead of ab­solv­ing them­selves of any risk by just charg­ing a match­mak­ing fee.</p>
    <p>KILLING CHICK­ENS</p>
    <p>In a clas­sic case of the pop­u­lar Chi­nese say­ing, “Killing the chicken to scare the mon­key”, the Shang­hai Stock Ex­change abruptly halted on Nov 3 Ant’s much-an­tic­i­pated de­but, send­ing shock waves through the fi­nan­cial world. The move prompted Ant to also freeze the Hong Kong leg of its dual list­ing sched­uled for Nov 5.</p>
    <p>Hum­bled, Ant pledged to em­brace reg­u­la­tion, apol­o­gised to in­vestors and promised re­funds.</p>
    <p>But there was more to come – on Tues­day, the an­titrust watchdog un­veiled draft reg­u­la­tions to put an end to prac­tices that had al­lowed Alibaba, Ten­cent Hold­ings, Baidu and other big In­ter­net com­pa­nies to flour­ish. Th­ese in­clude shar­ing sen­si­tive con­sumer data and preda­tory pric­ing to kill off ri­vals.</p>
    <p>On the same day, Mr Liang Tao, a vice-chair­man of the China Bank­ing and In­sur­ance Reg­u­la­tory Com­mis­sion, ef­fec­tively de­clared that “mis­tresses” too have to toe the line.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­la­tors are not against in­no­va­tion, he said at a con­fer­ence in Bei­jing, but they can­not ig­nore the risks and chal­lenges posed by fin­tech. Digi­ti­sa­tion doesn’t change the fun­da­men­tals of the fi­nan­cial in­dus­try and that means that fi­nan­cial tech­nol­ogy op­er­a­tors should be sub­ject to the same su­per­vi­sion and risk man­age­ment re­quire­ments as banks.</p>
    <p>In his keynote speech to the Bund Sum­mit, Vice-Pres­i­dent</p>
    <p>Wang had a mes­sage dif­fer­ent from Mr Ma’s, call­ing for a bal­ance be­tween in­no­va­tion and tough reg­u­la­tions to pre­vent fi­nan­cial risks, echo­ing Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s warn­ing last year against “black swan” and “grey rhino” fi­nan­cial events amid a slow­ing econ­omy.</p>
    <p>As a mem­ber of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party (CCP) and China’s best-known en­tre­pre­neur, Mr Ma could have qui­etly talked to his friends in high places and raised his mis­giv­ings about what he sees as un­rea­son­able reg­u­la­tions. In­stead, he chose to go pub­lic, per­haps be­liev­ing he had a good case plus the quiet sup­port of China’s pri­vate-sec­tor com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing the vast num­bers of small and medium-sized en­ter­prises hun­gry for loans but were forced to turn to Ant af­ter be­ing re­jected by risk-averse banks.</p>
    <p>What he had not reck­oned with was the grow­ing un­ease among China’s reg­u­la­tors about the risks of do­mes­tic banks in­creas­ingly us­ing mi­cro-lenders or third-party tech­nol­ogy plat­forms such as Ant to un­der­write loans amid all the un­cer­tain­ties of a pan­demic-hit econ­omy. De­faults en masse could spawn fi­nan­cial and so­cial in­sta­bil­ity – a night­mare sce­nario for sta­bil­ity-ob­sessed reg­u­la­tors.</p>
    <p>Prior to the Ant slap­down, there was al­ready con­cern about the flood of easy credit, es­pe­cially that tar­geted at young peo­ple, a point the for­mer cen­tral banker also made to ST.</p>
    <p>That comes amid a surge in growth of on­line con­sumer lend­ing through ve­hi­cles such as Huabei (just spend) and Jiebei (just bor­row) – two of Ant’s credit prod­ucts. The ag­gres­sive lend­ing has on oc­ca­sion back­fired, as in the case of a re­cent Huabei com­mer­cial that was crit­i­cised by ne­ti­zens for sug­gest­ing that work­ing-class par­ents in­cur debts on be­half of their chil­dren.</p>
    <p>It is there­fore not sur­pris­ing that Mr Ma did not elicit much sym­pa­thy from China’s so­cial me­dia users when he was smacked down by reg­u­la­tors, with one call­ing him a “greedy cap­i­tal­ist”.</p>
    <p>So­cial prob­lems aside, there is also an el­e­ment of in­creas­ing gov­ern­ment wari­ness over the in­flu­ence that Alibaba, Ten­cent and other In­ter­net giants have over broad swathes of the econ­omy – from e-com­merce, in­sur­ance and gam­ing to food de­liv­ery and trans­port.</p>
    <p>When the CCP’s elite Cen­tral Com­mit­tee wrapped up a four-day con­clave on Oct 29, it out­lined goals for China to be­come a leader in in­no­va­tion and to achieve ma­jor break­throughs in key core tech­nolo­gies by 2035.</p>
    <p>WHO CALLS THE SHOTS?</p>
    <p>What the crush­ing of Ant’s am­bi­tions and the moves to rein in China’s tech be­he­moths show is that how­ever much the party lead­er­ship wants China to achieve on the in­no­va­tion front, it is Pres­i­dent Xi and the CCP who will de­ter­mine how th­ese goals will be achieved.</p>
    <p>As Vic­tor Shih, au­thor of</p>
    <p>Fac­tions And Fi­nance In China: Elite Con­flict And In­fla­tion, puts it, the CCP is ef­fec­tively say­ing to Mr Ma – you may be plan­ning to launch the big­gest IPO in the world, but that’s no big deal to the party, which over­sees the world’s sec­ond-largest econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The as­ser­tion of gov­ern­ment con­trol over China’s tech giants not un­sur­pris­ingly roiled the mar­kets and raised ques­tions about how China will at­tain its tech and global fi­nance am­bi­tions, es­pe­cially against an Amer­ica that may be di­vided but is still open to free-spir­ited en­trepreneur­s and in­no­va­tors.</p>
    <p>In an ar­ti­cle head­lined “Jack Ma needs a re­fresher on how fi­nan­cial reg­u­la­tion works”, Ms Hu Yue of Caixin sug­gests that there is an­other way of look­ing at the is­sue: “With­out ef­fec­tive reg­u­la­tions, fi­nan­cial en­trepreneur­s can reap all the ben­e­fits from in­no­va­tions while so­ci­ety bears the risks.”</p>
    <p>Seen in that light, while mis­tresses may be more ex­cit­ing, the sta­bil­ity of the house­hold comes first.</p>
