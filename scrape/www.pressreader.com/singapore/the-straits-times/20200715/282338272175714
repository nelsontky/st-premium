    <p>LONDON • Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer has vowed his Manch­ester United side “will put it right” af­ter con­ced­ing a late goal against Southamp­ton on Mon­day, dent­ing their hopes of reach­ing next sea­son’s Cham­pi­ons League af­ter a one-year ab­sence.</p>
    <p>The fifth-placed Red Devils were on course for a fifth straight Premier League vic­tory af­ter bounc­ing back from Stu­art Arm­strong’s early opener with strikes from Mar­cus Rash­ford and An­thony Mar­tial.</p>
    <p>But just as Sol­sk­jaer’s men looked to have a lock on a top-four place, Saints sub­sti­tute Michael Obafemi struck in stop­page time to seal a 2-2 draw at Old Traf­ford.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier on Mon­day, the Court of Ar­bi­tra­tion for Sport over­turned Manch­ester City’s two-sea­son Euro­pean ban, mean­ing only the top­four English top-flight teams will qual­ify for next sea­son’s Cham­pi­ons league.</p>
    <p>Cham­pi­ons Liver­pool and sec­ond-placed City have al­ready se­cured their berths, leav­ing United, Chelsea and Le­ices­ter in a tus­sle for the two re­main­ing places, with one of the three teams set to miss out.</p>
    <p>Manch­ester United are un­beaten in 18 games in all com­pe­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>Still, United have an eas­ier run-in com­pared to the Blues and Foxes, whom they are be­hind only on goal dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Their next two games are against a Crys­tal Palace side in free fall – they have lost their past five league games – and West Ham, who are fight­ing for their lives and just three points above the rel­e­ga­tion zone.</p>
    <p>United travel to Le­ices­ter on the last day of the term, but with Bren­dan Rodgers’ side first need­ing to take on Europa League hope­fuls Sh­effield United and Tot­ten­ham, the King Power Sta­dium clash may not be a de­cider, pro­vided they do their part and re­sults go their way.</p>
    <p>“I have to say the men­tal­ity of the boys has been bril­liant,” Sol­sk­jaer said. “We’ve had a few set­backs over the sea­son, of course, and this is an­other chal­lenge for us.</p>
    <p>“I am very con­fi­dent in the men­tal­ity of them. Very dis­ap­pointed, of course, but we have to take the dis­ap­point­ments as well as the pos­i­tives when you win games.</p>
    <p>“We’ve learnt a hard les­son to­day, hope­fully, so we’ll make it right. I trust the boys in that re­spect.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter their trip to Palace to­mor­row, United will head to Wem­b­ley for their FA Cup semi-fi­nal with Chelsea on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Sol­sk­jaer may, how­ever, have a prob­lem at left-back af­ter he con­firmed Luke Shaw was a doubt for both games fol­low­ing an an­kle in­jury picked up against the Saints.</p>
    <p>His re­place­ment, Bran­don Wil­liams, was also forced off fol­low­ing a clash of heads that left him blood­ied.</p>

A win would have seen United leapfrog&#xAD;ging Le&#xAD;ices&#xAD;ter and Chelsea for third spot in the fight for Cham&#xAD;pi&#xAD;ons League places.</p>
