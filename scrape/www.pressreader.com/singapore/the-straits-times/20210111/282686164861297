    <p>LOS ANGELES • Michael Apted, a ver­sa­tile di­rec­tor who made his most last­ing mark with the Up doc­u­men­tary se­ries (1964 to 2019), which fol­lowed the lives of a group of Bri­tish peo­ple in seven-year in­ter­vals for more than a half cen­tury, died l ast Thurs­day at his home in Los Angeles. He was 79.</p>
    <p>His agent in the United States, Mr Roy Ash­ton, con­firmed the death but did not spec­ify a cause.</p>
    <p>Apted, who was Bri­tish, was a re­searcher at Granada Tele­vi­sion in Eng­land when he helped pick the 14 chil­dren, all of them aged seven, who be­came the sub­jects of Seven Up!. The ini­tial doc­u­men­tary in the Up se­ries, it was di­rected by the late Paul Al­mond and shown on Bri­tish tele­vi­sion in 1964.</p>
    <p>The film was in­tended as a one­off, but Apted picked up the ball seven years (more or less) later, act­ing as di­rec­tor of 7 Plus Seven, broad­cast in Eng­land in late 1970, in which he in­ter­viewed the same chil­dren, now at a more de­vel­oped stage of life.</p>
    <p>Then came 21 Up in 1977, 28 Up in 1984 and so on, with new in­stal­ments ar­riv­ing ev­ery seven years, all di­rected by Apted. 63 Up was re­leased in 2019.</p>
    <p>The films are a se­rial por­trait of a group of or­di­nary peo­ple, ob­serv­ing them as they ad­vance through life, from child­hood through adult­hood, and chart­ing their dif­fer­ent paths, chang­ing per­spec­tives and var­i­ous fates (one par­tic­i­pant, Lynn John­son, died in 2013).</p>
    <p>While re­vis­it­ing Up pe­ri­od­i­cally across six decades, Apted worked in tele­vi­sion and com­mer­cial film.</p>
    <p>Fic­tional drama Agatha (1979) about nov­el­ist Agatha Christie starred Vanessa Red­grave in the ti­tle role.</p>
    <p>Apted had par­tic­u­lar suc­cess in the 1980s, be­gin­ning in 1980 with Coal Miner’s Daugh­ter about coun­try singer Loretta Lynn, played by Sissy Spacek, who won the Best Ac­tress Os­car. The next year, he di­rected the John Belushi-Blair Brown com­edy Con­ti­nen­tal Di­vide (1981); two years later came the crime drama Gorky Park (1983), based on the Martin Cruz Smith novel, star­ring Wil­liam Hurt.</p>
    <p>In 1988, there was Go­ril­las In The Mist, the story of nat­u­ral­ist Dian</p>
    <p>Fossey. Its five Os­car nom­i­na­tions in­cluded one for Sigour­ney Weaver, who played Fossey.</p>
    <p>Apted’s 1990s films in­cluded Thun­der­heart (1992), a thriller with Val Kilmer; and the drama Nell (1994), a ve­hi­cle for Jodie Foster.</p>
    <p>Then came his en­try in the James Bond fran­chise – The World Is Not Enough (1999), with Pierce Bros­nan as agent 007.</p>
    <p>Apted was ac­tive in the Direc­tors Guild of Amer­ica and served as its pres­i­dent from 2003 to 2009.</p>
    <p>On­line bi­ogra­phies say he was mar­ried three times, most re­cently to Paige Simpson, who sur­vives him, along with a sis­ter, Carolyn; three chil­dren, Jim and John Apted and Lily Mel­lis; and four grand­chil­dren.</p>
