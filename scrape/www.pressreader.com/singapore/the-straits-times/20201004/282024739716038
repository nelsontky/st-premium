    <p>MO­SUL • As sun­set nears, the res­i­dents of Iraq’s Mo­sul flock to a gold-tinted statue of a woman look­ing out over their scarred city with an ex­pres­sion of steady de­fi­ance.</p>
    <p>It is one of a half-dozen works by lo­cal artists that have been erected across the north­ern Iraqi city since the Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group lost con­trol of it three years ago.</p>
    <p>The art­works are help­ing res­i­dents shake off mem­o­ries of bru­tal pun­ish­ments meted out by ISIS in squares and round­abouts, even as much of their city re­mains in ru­ins.</p>
    <p>My Lovely Lady was the first, put up in Septem­ber 2018 at a traf­fic cir­cle where ISIS fight­ers used to be­head or lash res­i­dents who had bro­ken its ul­tra-con­ser­va­tive rules.</p>
    <p>“By plac­ing this statue here, I was try­ing to erase these dark, ter­ri­fy­ing images from peo­ple’s minds,” said Mr Omar Ibrahim, the 35-year-old artist be­hind the work.</p>
    <p>“My Lovely Lady rep­re­sents Mo­sul’s beauty, its re­birth after over­com­ing all the ob­sta­cles of this nerve-rack­ing pe­riod,” he told</p>
    <p>Agence France-Press.</p>
    <p>Nerve-rack­ing it was: Mr Ibrahim cre­ated the sculp­ture in a se­cret base­ment stu­dio while ISIS was still con­trol­ling Mo­sul.</p>
    <p>When they first over­ran the city, the ter­ror­ists smashed works of art, mu­si­cal in­stru­ments and mil­len­nia-old arte­facts, deem­ing them vi­o­la­tions of their ul­tra-con­ser­va­tive views. They also banned artists from work­ing un­der penalty of death.</p>
    <p>It was a dev­as­tat­ing blow for Mo­sul, which had been known for cen­turies as a hub for mu­si­cians, writ­ers and artists.</p>
    <p>One favourite de­stroyed by ISIS was The Spring Girl, a young woman car­ry­ing a bou­quet and buf­feted by the wind. Mo­sul is known as “the Mother of Two Springs” be­cause of its mild weather in both spring and au­tumn. A re­make of the sculp­ture of a woman with flow­ing hair and a sly half-smile was erected this year against a back­drop of a bul­let-rid­dled build­ing, a reminder of Mo­sul’s grim re­cent his­tory.</p>
