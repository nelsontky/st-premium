    <p>OCBC Cen­tre in Raf­fles Place and Al-Hussain Restau­rant in Tampines were vis­ited by coro­n­avirus pa­tients while they were in­fec­tious, the Min­istry of Health said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Both were newly added to a list of places vis­ited by pa­tients in the com­mu­nity dur­ing their in­fec­tious pe­riod. The list can be ac­cessed on the gov.sg web­site.</p>
    <p>MOH an­nounced seven new Covid-19 pa­tients here yes­ter­day, of which one was a pa­tient in the com­mu­nity. It said the 39-year-old In­dian na­tional is a short­term visit pass holder whose spouse is a per­ma­nent res­i­dent. He is cur­rently not linked to other cases.</p>
    <p>The man ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore from the United States on Oct 11, and was placed on stay-home no­tice upon ar­rival. He tested neg­a­tive on Oct 22 while serv­ing his no­tice at a ded­i­cated fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>On Oct 30, he de­vel­oped a fever and sought med­i­cal treat­ment at a clinic, but was di­ag­nosed with sus­pected dengue. He later de­vel­oped acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion (ARI) symp­toms, and was tested for Covid-19 on Mon­day un­der en­hanced com­mu­nity testing to test all in­di­vid­u­als aged 13 and above who are di­ag­nosed with ARI.</p>
    <p>He was then taken to a hospi­tal when his test came back pos­i­tive on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Six im­ported pa­tients were also an­nounced yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,043. Among the six im­ported cases is a Sin­ga­porean toddler.</p>
    <p>The two-year-old boy re­turned from the Philip­pines. An­other two im­ported pa­tients are per­ma­nent res­i­dents. The first, a 61-year-old woman, re­turned from Iran, while the other, a 45-year-old man, ar­rived from In­dia.</p>
    <p>The fourth im­ported pa­tient is a long-term visit pass holder. The 33-year-old Viet­namese woman ar­rived from the United Arab Emi­rates.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing two im­ported cases are fe­male work per­mit hold­ers cur­rently em­ployed in Sin­ga­pore who ar­rived from In­done­sia. Both are In­done­sians, aged 31 and 36, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>All six im­ported cases did not show symp­toms, and tested pos­i­tive on Wed­nes­day. They had all been placed on stay-home no­tice upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore and were tested while serv­ing their no­tices.</p>
    <p>No new cases from within work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries were an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>MOH said that the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with a to­tal of two such cases in the past week. Both cases are cur­rently un­linked.</p>
    <p>With 11 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,934 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 40 pa­tients re­mained in hospi­tal yes­ter­day, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 26 were re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 28 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
