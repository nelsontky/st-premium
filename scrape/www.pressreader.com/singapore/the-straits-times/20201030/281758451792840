    <p>The num­ber of daily coro­n­avirus cases re­mains low, with none in the com­mu­nity or in mi­grant worker dor­mi­to­ries for two days in a row, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>But there has been a slight uptick in the av­er­age num­ber of new com­mu­nity cases.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity in­creased from an av­er­age of two cases two weeks ago to three in the past week, MOH added.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week also in­creased from one to three in the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore con­firmed seven new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day. All were im­ported.</p>
    <p>They com­prise two Sin­ga­pore­ans, one de­pen­dant’s pass holder, three work per­mit hold­ers and one spe­cial pass holder.</p>
    <p>The two Sin­ga­pore­ans are a 52-year-old man and a 46-year-old woman who ar­rived from In­dia, while the de­pen­dant’s pass holder is a 33-year-old woman who trav­elled from Switzer­land. She is a con­tact of a pre­vi­ous case.</p>
    <p>Two of the work per­mit hold­ers came from the Philip­pines and one ar­rived from In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>The one spe­cial pass holder is a 52-year-old man who re­turned from the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>They had all been placed on stay-home no­tices on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore and were tested while serv­ing their no­tices.</p>
    <p>MOH also an­nounced that the clus­ters at Avery Lodge Dor­mi­tory and Jurong Pen­juru Dor­mi­tory 2 have been closed as they have not had new cases linked to them for 28 days, or two in­cu­ba­tion pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s new cases take Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,994 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>With nine cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,884 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 37 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tals, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 30 are in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 28 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>With nine cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,884 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease. A to­tal of 37 pa­tients re­main in hospi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 30 are in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
