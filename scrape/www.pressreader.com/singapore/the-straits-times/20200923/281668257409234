    <p>•</p>
    <p>When the coro­n­avirus swept across Europe this spring, over­whelm­ing hos­pi­tals and killing thou­sands each day, only the sick­est pa­tients could be tested, leav­ing health of­fi­cials in the dark about how widely Covid-19 had spread.</p>
    <p>Six months on, with the virus surg­ing again, the au­thor­i­ties can point to dra­mat­i­cally ex­panded test­ing ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain alone car­ried out some 1.3 mil­lion tests in a re­cent week – a twen­ty­fold in­crease from early April.</p>
    <p>France and Spain, both Covid-19 hot spots, have like­wise in­creased their ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The ramp-up is help­ing the au­thor­i­ties to iden­tify thou­sands of in­fected in­di­vid­u­als, a key step to­wards curb­ing the pathogen with­out re­sort­ing to eco­nom­i­cally dev­as­tat­ing lock­downs.</p>
    <p>But cracks are emerg­ing.</p>
    <p>The mass test­ing is strain­ing lab­o­ra­to­ries, slow­ing re­sults and com­pli­cat­ing the con­tact trac­ing that is cru­cial to con­tain the virus.</p>
    <p>And many with the disease are ig­nor­ing rules on self-iso­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“That warps ev­ery­thing,” said struc­tural bi­ol­ogy pro­fes­sor James Nai­smith at Ox­ford Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>“Test­ing is only use­ful if it’s paired with rig­or­ous con­tact trac­ing and iso­la­tion.”</p>
    <p>With in­fec­tions ris­ing and win­ter around the cor­ner, some pub­lic health ad­vo­cates are sound­ing the alarm that the fo­cus on test­ing is tak­ing at­ten­tion away from the other mea­sures nec­es­sary to fight the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In France, the gov­ern­ment made tests free and widely avail­able, re­cently ratch­et­ing up the to­tal to 1.2 mil­lion a week.</p>
    <p>That has led to “grid­lock in ac­cess to tests, espe­cially in some large cities where the virus cir­cu­lates a lot”, Health Min­is­ter Olivier Ve­ran said last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Un­til re­cently, more than 99 per cent of tests were com­ing back neg­a­tive in some na­tions – a far cry from pos­i­tive rates of as much as half dur­ing the spring.</p>
    <p>Nowhere has the turn­about been more pro­nounced – or the po­lit­i­cal heat more in­tense – than in Bri­tain, which lagged be­hind other Euro­pean coun­tries in test­ing early on, but has now been do­ing more of it than any of its con­ti­nen­tal neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>With labs unable to han­dle the vol­ume, of­fi­cials in some coun­tries are again pri­ori­tis­ing test­ing for those who show symp­toms or may have been ex­posed to the virus.</p>
    <p>While that ap­proach is in line with World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion guide­lines, it is re­viv­ing con­cern for some that tests are in short sup­ply.</p>
    <p>To i mprove trac­ing, France, Bri­tain and other coun­tries rolled out smart­phone apps de­signed to no­tify those who may have been ex­posed to the virus, but pri­vacy con­cerns kept many from us­ing them.</p>
    <p>And, as the num­ber of Covid-19 clus­ters in­creases, the j ob of those work­ing the phones to track down the con­tacts of in­fected in­di­vid­u­als grows more daunt­ing each day.</p>
    <p>Still, if trac­ers man­age to reach some 50 per cent to 80 per cent of con­tacts – and if those peo­ple then ad­here to rules on quar­an­tin­ing – those ef­forts could be enough to pre­vent an­other lock­down, es­ti­mated Dr An­nelies Wilder-Smith, a pro­fes­sor of in­fec­tious dis­eases.</p>
    <p>“We are morally and eco­nom­i­cally ob­li­gated not to give up,” she said. “We owe it to our cit­i­zens.”</p>
    <p>Iso­lat­ing the in­fected, espe­cially those with a mild case, is an­other chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>Only one in five peo­ple with Covid-19 symp­toms in Bri­tain is prop­erly iso­lat­ing at home, ac­cord­ing to a re­cent re­port from a gov­ern­ment ad­vi­sory panel.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son’s of­fice said on Sun­day that those in Eng­land who refuse an or­der to self-iso­late could be fined as much as £10,000 (S$17,400).</p>
    <p>France re­cently loos­ened its manda­tory pe­riod of self-iso­la­tion for the in­fected to seven days from 14 days, bet­ting that peo­ple will be more likely to obey if the pe­riod is shorter.</p>
    <p>Ger­many has drawn praise dur­ing the pan­demic for rolling out mass test­ing early on.</p>
    <p>Even so, its case num­bers are ris­ing again, height­en­ing anx­i­eties about au­tumn and win­ter. In the Ger­man alpine re­sort town of Garmisch-Partenkirc­hen, the lim­its of test­ing re­cently came into sharp re­lief.</p>
    <p>An Amer­i­can woman in her 20s spent sev­eral nights vis­it­ing bars.</p>
    <p>When she showed symp­toms a few days later, she was tested and told by of­fi­cials to self-iso­late, but she con­tin­ued to go out.</p>
    <p>Health work­ers later f ound more than 30 new in­fec­tions po­ten­tially linked to the woman.</p>
    <p>Prose­cu­tors from Mu­nich are in­ves­ti­gat­ing whether to press charges.</p>
    <p>“That’s the whole story right there,” Dr Wilder-Smith said.</p>
    <p>“Iso­la­tion must be ab­so­lutely strict; you can­not have a mis­take.”</p>
    <p>Bri­tain alone car­ried out some 1.3 mil­lion tests in a re­cent week – a twen­ty­fold in­crease from early April. France and Spain, both Covid-19 hot spots, have like­wise in­creased their ca­pa­bil­i­ties. The ramp-up is help­ing the au­thor­i­ties to iden­tify thou­sands of in­fected in­di­vid­u­als, a key step to­wards curb­ing the pathogen with­out re­sort­ing to lock­downs. But cracks are emerg­ing.</p>
