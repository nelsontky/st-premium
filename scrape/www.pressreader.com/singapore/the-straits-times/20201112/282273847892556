    <p>Sem­b­corp Ma­rine (Sem­bMarine) con­tin­ued to in­cur losses for its fis­cal third quar­ter end­ing Sept 30, with low over­all busi­ness vol­ume and ex­e­cu­tion de­lays, it said yes­ter­day in a busi­ness update.</p>
    <p>Sem­bMarine “ex­pects losses to con­tinue into the fourth quar­ter”, the group added in the ex­change fil­ing. It did not pro­vide de­tails on the level of losses in­curred in the third quar­ter or ex­pected for the fourth quar­ter.</p>
    <p>In July, Sem­bMarine had re­ported a net loss of $192.1 mil­lion for the first half of this year.</p>
    <p>In its busi­ness update, Sem­bMarine said its Sin­ga­pore yards be­gan to re­sume pro­duc­tion ac­tiv­i­ties in early July, fol­low­ing the re­lax­ation of Covid-19 mea­sures. Its op­er­at­ing yard work­force, in­clud­ing sub­con­trac­tors, has since in­creased to al­most full work­force lev­els.</p>
    <p>It added: “With oil prices re­cov­er­ing since the March col­lapse, there have been ac­tive re­views of de­ferred projects by the oil com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>“New or­ders vis­i­bil­ity has im­proved as a re­sult, and the group is in­creas­ingly ac­tive in bid­ding for new projects and dis­cussing re­sump­tion of de­layed projects.”</p>
    <p>The group is ac­tively ten­der­ing for more than 10 projects, es­pe­cially in the greener en­ergy mar­ket seg­ments such as re­new­able en­ergy and gas so­lu­tions. It added that a sim­i­lar num­ber of ten­ders are also in progress for the process so­lu­tions seg­ment.</p>
    <p>Sem­bMarine said it is ex­e­cut­ing a to­tal of $1.78 bil­lion of sig­nif­i­cant projects. Its re­pairs and up­grades busi­ness is also un­der­tak­ing about $330 mil­lion of on­go­ing jobs and new or­ders se­cured dur­ing the quar­ter.</p>
    <p>De­liv­ery dates for most of its ex­ist­ing projects have been resched­uled by be­tween three and 12 months, but there has been no can­cel­la­tion of any ex­ist­ing project to date, Sem­bMarine noted.</p>
    <p>It said the com­ple­tion of the group’s $2.1 bil­lion rights is­sue has strength­ened its liq­uid­ity po­si­tion and bal­ance sheet. It is now fo­cused on ex­e­cut­ing its projects and se­cur­ing new or­ders.</p>
    <p>“We will work to man­age our costs and liq­uid­ity pru­dently to en­sure we are able to sus­tain our op­er­a­tions and ride through the se­vere in­dus­try down­turn and Covid-19 pan­demic,” Sem­bMarine said.</p>
