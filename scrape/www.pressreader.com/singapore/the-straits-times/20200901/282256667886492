    <p>The Govern­ment, em­ploy­ers and cit­i­zens will need to step up to the plate for the Sin­ga­porean work­force to hold its own in a com­pet­i­tive and rapidly chang­ing market, said newly elected Peo­ple’s Action Party MP Mariam Jaa­far (Sem­bawang GRC).</p>
    <p>Be­low are ex­cerpts from her maiden speech in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day:</p>
    <p>I be­lieve Sin­ga­pore can build a last­ing com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tage by be­ing the na­tion that learns the fastest.</p>
    <p>To­day, I will fo­cus on two things we must pri­ori­tise to do that. One, in­vest­ing in our peo­ple and two, giv­ing them op­por­tu­nity...</p>
    <p>I be­lieve it’s time to go full throt­tle to help our peo­ple quickly ac­quire job-ori­ented skills and, cru­cially, to pro­vide them im­me­di­ate op­por­tu­ni­ties to use those skills in mean­ing­ful work.</p>
    <p>For this to hap­pen, em­ploy­ers must be a big­ger part of the so­lu­tion. First, they must take greater ac­count­abil­ity for their em­ploy­ees’ learn­ing.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, they must be will­ing to give more Sin­ga­pore­ans a chance, and look be­yond pa­per and past ex­pe­ri­ence, in­stead mak­ing their hir­ing and ca­reer pro­gres­sion and re­ten­tion de­ci­sions based on skills...</p>
    <p>Google launched its new Google Ca­reer Cer­tifi­cates pro­gramme, a col­lec­tion of six-month-long cour­ses de­signed to help par­tic­i­pants get qual­i­fi­ca­tions in high-pay­ing, high-growth job fields with­out at­tend­ing univer­sity...</p>
    <p>The cost of this pro­gramme? The IT sup­port cer­tifi­cate costs US$49 (S$67) a month, or US$300 for six months. That’s less than what you and I get in Skill­sFu­ture credit...</p>
    <p>Of course, we don’t know how many of those who com­plete the Google Cer­tifi­cates pro­gramme will ac­tu­ally get jobs as a re­sult, but it does paint what the fu­ture could look like: Em­ploy­ers de­vel­op­ing their own or col­lab­o­rat­ing with higher-learn­ing in­sti­tutes and other part­ners to of­fer pre-skilling, up­skilling and reskilling op­por­tu­ni­ties, from ap­pren­tice­ships and trainee­ships, to short cour­ses, to reskilling boot camps, along a life­long learn­ing path where they are able to quickly ap­ply what they learn...</p>
    <p>To in­crease op­por­tu­ni­ties for job seek­ers in par­tic­u­lar, we also ask com­pa­nies to con­sider if they can hire a lit­tle ahead of de­mand, or to loosen their screen­ing cri­te­ria and take a chance on Sin­ga­pore­ans who may not look like the per­fect fit in terms of pa­per qual­i­fi­ca­tions and past in­dus­try ex­pe­ri­ence, but have suf­fi­cient rel­e­vant skills to get in the door and the at­ti­tude to learn the rest on the job if they are just given the op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>Some com­pa­nies will re­quire sup­port to do all this. For ex­am­ple, for small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs), the Govern­ment can play a big­ger role, cre­at­ing plat­forms to train their em­ploy­ees at scale and at speed, while si­mul­ta­ne­ously help­ing the SMEs to trans­form and re­design their jobs where nec­es­sary. And of course, the Govern­ment is al­ready help­ing...</p>
    <p>But good pol­icy in it­self is not enough.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple must also trust the im­ple­men­ta­tion. Trust that they will be given a fair chance. But we also know the best schemes don’t al­ways work out for ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>We’ve met them. We’ve all met them among our res­i­dents, our friends – Sin­ga­pore­ans who don’t feel they are be­ing given a fair chance.</p>
    <p>The 50-some­thing PMET who was re­trenched when his com­pany was ac­quired and has gone for count­less in­ter­views, only to be told he is “overqual­i­fied” for the roles.</p>
    <p>The 40-some­thing banker who was first put on no-pay leave and then let go be­cause he was told there was no busi­ness need, only to see a for­eigner take his place two months later, while he him­self is un­able to get back into an in­dus­try that is sup­posed to be still grow­ing.</p>
    <p>The 30-some­thing Malay ac­counts clerk who goes through count­less job ad­ver­tise­ments and in­ter­views, only to find that many of the jobs are for Man­darin speak­ers only, as if com­put­ers and ledgers can speak only Man­darin.</p>
    <p>The 20-some­thing grad­u­ate, a few years out of school, who in­ter­views for jobs that ask for ex­pe­ri­ence, only to be of­fered a ba­sic pay that he be­lieves can only be called a low-ball of­fer, lower than what a fresh grad should be mak­ing.</p>
    <p>If peo­ple get a bad taste that no mat­ter how hard they work, the sys­tem is stacked against them, it leads to cyn­i­cism.</p>
    <p>And be­cause we Sin­ga­pore­ans ac­tu­ally have a strong sense of fair­ness and root­ing for the un­der­dog, if peo­ple see too many peo­ple around them like that, it can lead to po­lar­i­sa­tion, which only hurts our com­pet­i­tive­ness.</p>
