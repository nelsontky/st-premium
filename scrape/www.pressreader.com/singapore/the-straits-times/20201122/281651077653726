    <p>The Malaysian govern­ment will lift the con­di­tional move­ment con­trol or­der (CMCO) on four states, but has put Ke­lan­tan un­der l ock­down and an­nounced that all for­eign work­ers i n se­lect re­gions will have to un­dergo manda­tory Covid-19 tests.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter Is­mail Sabri Yaakob said a CMCO was im­posed on Ke­lan­tan from yes­ter­day due to a hike in Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>This comes af­ter the Mengketil clus­ter in the state recorded 41 cases across mul­ti­ple districts.</p>
    <p>He also said the CMCO would end in Kedah, Me­laka, Tereng­ganu and Jo­hor from to­day, ear­lier than the ini­tially set date of Dec 6.</p>
    <p>Malaysia on Nov 9 ex­panded CMCO to nine of its 13 states af­ter a spike in coron­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the coun­try recorded 1,041 new i nfec­tions, bring­ing the to­tal to 53,679.</p>
    <p>It also re­ported three more Covid-19-re­lated deaths, which pushed the death toll to 332.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Is­mail Sabri also an­nounced that for­eign work­ers in Se­lan­gor, Negeri Sem­bi­lan, Pe­nang, Sabah, Kuala Lumpur and the is­land of Labuan in all sec­tors and in­dus­tries are to un­dergo com­pul­sory Covid-19 tests.</p>
    <p>The or­der does not cover do­mes­tic work­ers such as maids.</p>
    <p>The Se­nior Min­is­ter said this would be phase one of the pol­icy to com­pel for­eign work­ers to be</p>
    <p>tested, fol­low­ing an in­crease in the num­ber of cases among them.</p>
    <p>He said the Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil (MKN) de­cided on this at a meet­ing on Fri­day fol­low­ing a pro­posal tabled by the Hu­man Re­sources Min­istry.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter lis­ten­ing to the pro­posal and on the ad­vice of the Health Min­istry, the spe­cial meet­ing agreed to make it com­pul­sory for for­eign work­ers in th­ese states as well as Kuala Lumpur and Labuan to un­dergo RTK-anti­gen (rapid test kit-anti­gen) swab tests,” he said.</p>
    <p>He did not say when the manda­tory test­ing of for­eign work­ers would take ef­fect.</p>
    <p>The MKN spe­cial meet­ing was told that as at Oct 31, there were 1,615,83 for­eign work­ers in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Mr Is­mail Sabri said the for­eign work­ers will be tested at their work­places and con­struc­tion sites.</p>
    <p>The RTK-anti­gen test would be used as it can re­turn re­sults faster.</p>
