    <p>THESEUS CHAN, 59</p>
    <p>Founder of mul­ti­dis­ci­plinary de­sign stu­dio Work, and De­signer of the Year at the in­au­gu­ral Pres­i­dent’s De­sign Award in 2006.</p>
    <p>“While 2020 has the mak­ings of an an­nus hor­ri­bilis, it has not been all doom and gloom for the de­sign com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>I have seen de­sign­ers bond­ing, shar­ing re­sources and gen­er­ally look­ing out for one an­other through­out 2020. If any­thing, it has dawned on me that as the year ends, we must all reach out to one an­other. We also need to cel­e­brate our de­signs, which I think have made great strides in the last two decades.</p>
    <p>Mov­ing ahead, we must con­tinue to share Sin­ga­pore’s de­sign, de­sign­ers, cre­ations and ur­ban cul­ture with the rest of the world with con­fi­dence and strength.”</p>
    <p>PIYUSH GUPTA, 60</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive of DBS Group, which was named World’s Best Bank by fi­nan­cial pub­li­ca­tion Global Fi­nance for the third con­sec­u­tive year.</p>
    <p>“We will look back at 2020 as a sem­i­nal year in three important re­gards.</p>
    <p>First, a ma­jor in­flec­tion point in dig­i­tal con­sump­tion, es­pe­cially of ser­vices like health, ed­u­ca­tion and fi­nance.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, a dra­matic evo­lu­tion in work ar­range­ments, with ’Zoom’ and ‘work from home’ be­com­ing by­words.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, a recog­ni­tion that tail risks do oc­cur and at­ten­tion to these is of para­mount im­por­tance.</p>
    <p>But, above all, the year served to re­mind us that it is sol­i­dar­ity and the per­sonal touch that make us a hu­man race.”</p>
    <p>JOSEPH SCHOOL­ING, 25</p>
    <p>Olympic swim­ming cham­pion who was meant to de­fend his 100m but­ter­fly ti­tle at the Tokyo Games, which were even­tu­ally post­poned to next year.</p>
    <p>“2020 is a mixed bag of emo­tions for me. I think you can find pos­i­tives out of ev­ery negative. On one hand, I am glad to have more time to pre­pare for Tokyo 2020.</p>
    <p>It gives me an ex­tra year to get phys­i­cally and men­tally stronger, work­ing on the things that can get me to where I want to be in 2021.</p>
    <p>Although we’ve had to do things a bit dif­fer­ently, ‘dif­fer­ent’ doesn’t mean we can’t do other things to get me to the same spot I wanted to be in.</p>
    <p>So I’m look­ing at the ex­tra year as a pos­i­tive boost for my­self.”</p>
    <p>NG CHEE MENG, 52</p>
    <p>Sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC).</p>
    <p>“To me as the labour chief, 2020 has been about jobs, jobs and jobs – help­ing our work­ers keep their jobs; help­ing those who lost their jobs find jobs soon­est; and up­skilling those with jobs to take on higher-value roles.</p>
    <p>It has been a year of trep­i­da­tion, with the pan­demic im­pact­ing ev­ery­one world­wide. But one thing is cer­tain in Sin­ga­pore – that NTUC, unions and tri­par­tite part­ners are do­ing all we can to save the lives and liveli­hoods of our work­ers.</p>
    <p>As 2020 draws to a close, I want to as­sure our work­ers that you will re­main at the heart of ev­ery­thing we do, and NTUC will con­tinue to do all we can to pro­tect and care for you.”</p>
