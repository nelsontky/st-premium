    <p>A to­tal of 71 com­plaints of sex­ual mis­con­duct in­volv­ing stu­dents were made to the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) in the past five years.</p>
    <p>The num­ber was high­est in 2019, when 25 such re­ports were made.</p>
    <p>This was the year former NUS stu­dent Mon­ica Baey sparked a dis­cus­sion about sex­ual mis­con­duct, by voic­ing her frus­tra­tion that the univer­sity had not done more against a male stu­dent who filmed her in the shower at the Eu­soff Hall stu­dent res­i­dence.</p>
    <p>In its first re­port on sex­ual mis­con­duct, sent to stu­dents and staff yes­ter­day, NUS laid out a sum­mary of past and present cases, in­clud­ing the type of com­plaints it re­ceived, and a break­down of last year’s cases.</p>
    <p>It had 12 com­plaints of sex­ual mis­con­duct last year. Dur­ing the year, its Board of Dis­ci­pline or Dis­ci­plinary Ap­peals Board also dealt with an­other three cases in­volv­ing stu­dents, act­ing on com­plaints made prior to last year.</p>
    <p>The univer­sity said the re­port will be pro­vided ev­ery six months, with the hope of strength­en­ing and deep­en­ing trust within the NUS com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“It is im­por­tant that ev­ery in­ci­dent of sex­ual mis­con­duct be man­aged in a just and sen­si­tive man­ner, guided by the prin­ci­ples of fair­ness and neu­tral­ity. Each com­plaint is taken se­ri­ously and in­ves­ti­gated thor­oughly fol­low­ing due pro­cesses,” it stated in the re­port.</p>
    <p>It added that more in­di­vid­u­als are com­ing for­ward to file re­ports against al­leged per­pe­tra­tors of sex­ual mis­con­duct.</p>
    <p>NUS said the ma­jor­ity of the com­plaints in 2019 were made af­ter a town hall meet­ing it held on sex­ual mis­con­duct in April that year to ad­dress stu­dents’ con­cerns.</p>
    <p>One-third of the com­plaints – 24 out of 71 – made be­tween 2016 and last year in­volved ver­bal or phys­i­cal con­tact of a sex­ual nature and 18 re­ports were of voyeurism.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing com­plaints were of other types, such as un­der­gar­ment theft, up­skirt pho­to­graphs or videos and in­de­cent ex­po­sure.</p>
    <p>There were also two re­ports of rape made to the univer­sity dur­ing these years. NUS said the com­plainants al­leged non-con­sen­sual sex, but no fur­ther ac­tion was taken af­ter in­ves­ti­ga­tions by both the po­lice and the univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Of the 71 cases, 42 were seen by the NUS Board of Dis­ci­pline, while 11 were re­ferred to their re­spec­tive fac­ul­ties for dis­ci­plinary ac­tion. No fur­ther ac­tion was taken for 13 cases due to in­suf­fi­cient ev­i­dence and in­ves­ti­ga­tions are pend­ing in the re­main­ing five com­plaints.</p>
    <p>NUS also re­ceived 19 com­plaints of sex­ual mis­con­duct in­volv­ing staff be­tween 2016 and last year.</p>
    <p>Most of these were clas­si­fied un­der ver­bal or phys­i­cal con­tact of a sex­ual nature, and mak­ing un­wanted sex­ual ad­vances or re­quests for sex­ual favours.</p>
    <p>In its re­port, NUS also gave an up­date on its ini­tia­tives to build a cul­ture of re­spect and con­sent. All stu­dents and staff un­dergo manda­tory train­ing on re­spect and con­sent.</p>
    <p>About 97 per cent of 30,000 stu­dents have com­pleted an on­line mod­ule on the topic, with 7,274 of them who stay on cam­pus also at­tend­ing a face-to-face work­shop.</p>
    <p>Most staff – 84 per cent of about 13,200 – have com­pleted an on­line mod­ule on re­spect and con­sent.</p>
    <p>NUS will in­tro­duce by­stander train­ing to re­in­force the im­por­tance of by­standers in tack­ling sex­ual mis­con­duct.</p>
    <p>It is hold­ing first-re­spon­der train­ing work­shops for staff such as depart­ment heads, who are likely to be the first re­spon­ders in in­ci­dents of sex­ual mis­con­duct.</p>
    <p>To date, 284 staff have been iden­ti­fied and trained.</p>
