    <p>Mr Mar­cus Yeo had to join the job hunt in April, when his fam­i­ly­owned es­tab­lish­ment Baystro Bud­dies had to shut due to Covid-19 re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>“When we were forced to close, it was re­ally bad. We had no in­come at all,” said the 35-year-old, who was a man­ager at the pub for 11/ years.</p>
    <p>“The rental was high and we couldn’t main­tain it, so we de­cided to close it for good a few months later.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter two months, Mr Yeo, who had more than 10 years of ex­pe­ri­ence in sales and mar­ket­ing be­fore that, fi­nally landed a job, but in a dif­fer­ent line. He was of­fered a sup­ply chain man­ager po­si­tion at New Re­tail In­ter­na­tional, where he now man­ages its e-com­merce gro­cery shop­ping plat­form WeBuy.</p>
    <p>“I ap­plied for the job be­cause it in­volves han­dling sup­pli­ers and build­ing re­la­tion­ships with them. I thought it was some­thing I could be good at, since I like deal­ing with peo­ple,” he said. “So I took the job, but it came with a lot of un­knowns.”</p>
    <p>Thank­fully, his gen­eral man­ager pa­tiently guided him through the en­tire lo­gis­tics process.</p>
    <p>The com­pany also en­rolled him in a lo­gis­tics pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­gramme in Au­gust to aid in his tran­si­tion.</p>
    <p>He has since learnt about the in­dus­try’s best prac­tices, in­clud­ing how au­to­ma­tion can be used to speed up work­flow.</p>
    <p>The ca­reer switch has been a boon for Mr Yeo, who now deals with lo­cal and over­seas sup­pli­ers.</p>
    <p>His salary has in­creased by nearly 10 per cent from his pre­vi­ous job as a pub man­ager.</p>
    <p>He has also found job sat­is­fac­tion. “It is not mun­dane. Ev­ery day comes with a dif­fer­ent sit­u­a­tion to han­dle,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo, who is mar­ried to a 35-year-old dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing pro­ject man­ager, urged job seek­ers who may be hes­i­tant to move to a dif­fer­ent sec­tor to give it a try.</p>
    <p>“If I never made the switch, I would never have ex­plored lo­gis­tics and found some­thing I en­joy do­ing,” he added.</p>
