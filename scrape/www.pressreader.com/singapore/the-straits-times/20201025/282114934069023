    <p>Justin Thomas fired a sec­ond suc­ces­sive seven-un­der 65 for the halfway lead at the Zozo Cham­pi­onship on Fri­day, but he was not a happy man de­spite be­ing in prime po­si­tion for a 14th PGA Tour ti­tle.</p>
    <p>“I played well. But I’m not very pleased with the fin­ish. The last six holes I would have liked to at least have got some­thing,” said the 27-year-old who leads on 14-un­der 130 at Sher­wood Coun­try Club, Thou­sand Oaks, Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>The 2017 FedExCup cham­pion made seven birdies in his open­ing 12 holes af­ter start­ing from the 10th but parred home the last six on an­other day of low scor­ing in the US$8 mil­lion (S$10.9 mil­lion) show­piece which moved from Ja­pan to the United States this year due to the coro­n­avirus pandemic.</p>
    <p>De­spite go­ing bo­gey-free, Thomas was dis­ap­pointed he did not take ad­van­tage of ideal scor­ing con­di­tions, es­pe­cially on the par fives on his in­ward nine.</p>
    <p>He ended the day one ahead of Lanto Grif­fin and South Africa’s Dy­lan Frit­telli, who shot match­ing 65s. Last sea­son’s Rookie of the</p>
    <p>Year, Scot­tie Sch­ef­fler, and world No. 14 Pa­trick Cant­lay also carded 65s to lie two back.</p>
    <p>With Sher­wood yield­ing l ow scores – 56 play­ers shot in the 60s on Fri­day – Thomas knows he needs to keep his foot on the pedal to savour a first win of the 2020-21 sea­son.</p>
    <p>It will be the 11th oc­ca­sion he has led or co-led af­ter 36-holes on Tour where he has gone on to win on six oc­ca­sions, the last be­ing at the CJ Cup in South Korea last Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>“It’s not very dif­fi­cult,” said Thomas. “Got off to a hot start to­day and kind of coasted com­ing in. If you are get­ting the ball in play off the tee there are so many scor­ing clubs. You can at­tack it if you are re­ally play­ing well.</p>
    <p>“It’s short and the greens are soft right now. So ob­vi­ously if they get firmer and they tuck the pins a lit­tle bit more, it is go­ing to be harder and the scores will be higher.”</p>
    <p>A pack on 133 in­cluded Bubba Wat­son and Pa­trick Reed, who both shot 63, and fel­low Amer­i­can Richy Weren­ski, who set a course record with a 61.</p>
    <p>He made six birdies on both the front and back nine against a lone bo­gey at the par-four sixth to break the old mark of 62 set by Tiger Woods.</p>
    <p>De­fend­ing Zozo cham­pion Woods, who won the in­au­gu­ral edition last year in Ja­pan, opened with a 76 but bounced back with a 66, match­ing his best since last year’s event.</p>
    <p>“I hit the ball so much bet­ter,” he said. “To­day was a lot more sharp and a lot more crisp and clean.”</p>
    <p>The 15-time Ma­jor cham­pion birdied four of the first six holes and two of the last three but still shared 66th in a field of 77.</p>
    <p>He had four birdies and a par on the par-five holes af­ter go­ing three­over on them on Thursday.</p>
    <p>“Yes­ter­day was not very good,”</p>
    <p>Woods added. “I re­ally didn’t swing the club that poorly. I was just a frac­tion off and I got out of po­si­tion a cou­ple times.</p>
    <p>“It just snow­balled into a high num­ber. Was never re­ally able to get any kind of mo­men­tum go­ing.</p>
    <p>“To­day was dif­fer­ent. Got off to a much bet­ter start and kept rolling.”</p>
