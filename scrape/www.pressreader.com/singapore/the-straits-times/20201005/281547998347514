    <p>Uruguayan striker Edin­son Ca­vani (right) is head­ing to Old Traf­ford. The 33-year-old is set to sign a one-year deal with Manch­ester United, with an op­tion for an­other year. Ca­vani, Paris Saint-Ger­main’s all-time top scorer with 200 goals, has been with­out a club since leav­ing the French cham­pi­ons at the end of June.</p>
    <p>Edin­son Ca­vani is ex­pected to be con­firmed as a Manch­ester United player to­day af­ter fly­ing into Eng­land yes­ter­day for talks and a med­i­cal.</p>
    <p>The free agent, who has been with­out a club since leav­ing Paris Saint-Ger­main at the end of June, is set to sign a one-year deal, with an op­tion for an ad­di­tional year.</p>
    <p>Ca­vani’s agent Wal­ter Gugliel­mone told In­side Fut­bol on Satur­day night: “It’s true. There is an agree­ment.”</p>
    <p>The Uruguayan striker will add com­pe­ti­tion to their front line in a com­pressed sea­son af­fected by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. Odion Ighalo is pro­vid­ing backup to An­thony Mar­tial but will re­turn to Shang­hai Shen­hua when his loan ex­pires at the end of Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Ca­vani, PSG’s all-time top scorer with 200 goals in seven sea­sons at the Parc des Princes, could make his de­but against his for­mer club as United open their Cham­pi­ons League cam­paign away to the French cham­pi­ons on Oct 20.</p>
    <p>He has also scored 50 goals in 116 ap­pear­ances for Uruguay.</p>
    <p>United be­lieve the 33-year-old can bring a win­ning men­tal­ity, lead­er­ship and ex­pe­ri­ence to Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer’s young squad. He has won 20 hon­ours in his time in Europe and also claimed the Copa Amer­ica with Uruguay in 2011.</p>
    <p>The hope is that Mason Green­wood, 18, Mar­cus Rash­ford, 22, and Mar­tial, 24, can learn from Ca­vani.</p>
    <p>United also point to Zla­tan Ibrahi­movic’s suc­cess­ful spell at the club for sign­ing a vet­eran. The Swede ar­rived at Old Traf­ford in 2016 at the age of 34 and scored 28 goals in 46 games in his first sea­son at the club.</p>
    <p>United fans, how­ever, will also re­mem­ber ex­pen­sive older flops in Radamel Fal­cao, 28 in 2014, and Alexis Sanchez, 29 in 2018. The lat­ter was given a £350,000-a-week (S$617,411) con­tract. Ca­vani re­port­edly took home £360,000-a-week at PSG but the Daily Mail re­ported that his United deal will be worth £210,000 af­ter tax.</p>
    <p>United tried to sign Ca­vani dur­ing David Moyes’ reign in 2014, when he was one of the world’s most coveted strik­ers.</p>
    <p>Yet his i mpend­ing ar­rival on trans­fer dead­line day hints at des­per­a­tion, not least be­cause he has been avail­able all sum­mer.</p>
    <p>The club have been crit­i­cised by fans for their lack of ac­tiv­ity in the trans­fer mar­ket, which they went into with the aim of sign­ing a winger, left-back and cen­tre-back.</p>
    <p>Dutch mid­fielder Donny van de</p>
    <p>Beek is the only sign­ing of the win­dow so far with the Red Devils re­fus­ing to match Borus­sia Dort­mund’s ask­ing price of £108 mil­lion for first-choice tar­get Jadon San­cho.</p>
    <p>Wa t f o r d ’ s Is­maila Sarr, Fiorentina’s Fed­erico Chiesa, and Barcelona’s Ous­mane Dem­bele have been con­sid­ered as al­ter­na­tives but the winger who is due in Manch­ester to­day is 18-year-old Fa­cundo Pel­listri from Pe­narol.</p>
    <p>The Uruguayan, rec­om­mended by his for­mer Pe­narol coach and United striker Diego For­lan, is ex­pected to cost £10 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Ques­tions over de­fen­sive re­in­force­ments in light of United’s frail­ties at the back re­main.</p>
    <p>De­spite be­ing linked with RB</p>
    <p>Leipzig’s Dayot Upame­cano and Napoli’s Kali­dou Koulibaly, United still have not brought in a cen­tral de­fender that could part­ner cap­tain Harry Maguire.</p>
    <p>The club are re­port­edly work­ing on a deal to sign Porto left-back Alex Telles af­ter watch­ing their other tar­get Ser­gio Reguilon move to ri­vals Tot­ten­ham.</p>
    <p>For­mer United de­fender Gary Neville has been frus­trated by the lack of new sign­ings.</p>
    <p>“United just don’t seem to be able to get deals done. Even with Harry Maguire last year, it dragged on right to the end, San­cho this year,” he said. “They just don’t seem to be able to get deals over the line, they don’t seem to be able to get things done.”</p>

        <p data-role="text">Uruguay in&#xAD;ter&#xAD;na&#xAD;tional Edin&#xAD;son Ca&#xAD;vani has a long pedi&#xAD;gree as a top striker in Europe, but at 33, he will be no more than a stop-gap mea&#xAD;sure with Manch&#xAD;ester United un&#xAD;able to make head&#xAD;way in land&#xAD;ing other pre&#xAD;ferred tar&#xAD;gets.</p>
