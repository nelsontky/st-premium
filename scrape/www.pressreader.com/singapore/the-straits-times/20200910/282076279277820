    <p>A to­tal of 273 peo­ple have been ar­rested in a two-week anti-loan­shark blitz.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on Tues­day, the po­lice said they ar­rested 207 men and 66 women, aged be­tween 16 and 70, for their sus­pected in­volve­ment in loan-shark­ing ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The op­er­a­tion took place over a fort­night from Aug 24 to last Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the op­er­a­tion, of­fi­cers from the Crim­i­nal In­ves­ti­ga­tion De­part­ment and the seven po­lice land di­vi­sions con­ducted si­mul­ta­ne­ous raids at mul­ti­ple lo­ca­tions is­land­wide.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said pre­lim­i­nary in­ves­ti­ga­tions re­vealed that 67 sus­pects were likely run­ners who had as­sisted loan sharks to carry out ATM trans­fers and col­lect debts in per­son.</p>
    <p>An­other seven sus­pects are be­lieved to have car­ried out acts of ha­rass­ment by splash­ing paint and scrawl­ing loan shark-re­lated graf­fiti on walls.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing 199 peo­ple ar­rested are sus­pected to have opened bank ac­counts and handed over their ATM cards and PINs to loan sharks to fa­cil­i­tate their un­li­censed mon­eylend­ing.</p>
    <p>Po­lice said in­ves­ti­ga­tions are un­der way.</p>
    <p>They added that un­der the Moneylen­ders’ Act (Re­vised Edi­tion 2010), when a bank ac­count or</p>
    <p>ATM card of any per­son is used to fa­cil­i­tate mon­eylend­ing by an un­li­censed money­len­der, that per­son is pre­sumed to have as­sisted in un­li­censed mon­eylend­ing.</p>
    <p>First-time of­fend­ers found guilty of car­ry­ing out or as­sist­ing in the busi­ness of un­li­censed mon­eylend­ing may be fined be­tween $30,000 and $300,000, jailed for up to four years and given up to six strokes of the cane.</p>
    <p>Those guilty of act­ing on be­half of an un­li­censed money­len­der, com­mit­ting or at­tempt­ing to com­mit any acts of ha­rass­ment for the first time, face jail of up to five years, a fine of be­tween $5,000 and $50,000, and be­tween three and six strokes of the cane.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said they will con­tinue to take tough en­force­ment ac­tion against those in­volved in the loan­shark­ing busi­ness, re­gard­less of their roles, and they will face the full brunt of the law.</p>
    <p>“This would in­clude tak­ing ac­tion against those who open or give away their bank ac­counts to aid un­li­censed moneylen­ders,” they added.</p>
    <p>Those who sus­pect or know of any­one who could be in­volved in il­le­gal loan-shark­ing ac­tiv­i­ties can call the po­lice on 999 or the X-Ah Long hot­line on 1800-924-5664.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said they will con­tinue to take tough en­force­ment ac­tion against those in­volved in the loan-shark­ing busi­ness, re­gard­less of their roles, and they will face the full brunt of the law.</p>
