    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong has called on Sin­ga­pore­ans to unite to help the coun­try face the dif­fi­cult months and years that lie ahead in the light of the Covid-19 pan­demic. Speak­ing at a cer­e­mony to swear in his new team, he said that he has formed the strong­est Cabi­net he could, to vig­or­ously deal with the se­vere eco­nomic and pub­lic health chal­lenges con­fronting the na­tion.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong has called on Sin­ga­pore­ans to unite to help the coun­try face the dif­fi­cult months and years that lie ahead in the light of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at a cer­e­mony to swear in his new team, he said that he has formed the strong­est Cabi­net he could, to deal vig­or­ously with the se­vere eco­nomic and pub­lic health chal­lenges con­fronting the na­tion.</p>
    <p>Now that the gen­eral elec­tion is over, the work of the new Cabi­net and Govern­ment has al­ready be­gun. Apart from de­vel­op­ing the abil­ity to stamp out any fresh Covid-19 out­breaks, the na­tion needed to get its econ­omy go­ing again, save jobs and reskill work­ers for new ones.</p>
    <p>“The elec­tions are be­hind us. What­ever our po­lit­i­cal per­sua­sions, never for­get that we are first and fore­most Sin­ga­pore­ans,” said PM Lee. “Let us all unite and fo­cus our en­er­gies on the ma­jor chal­lenges ahead.”</p>
    <p>He was ad­dress­ing col­leagues at the Is­tana’s State Room in a cer­e­mony to swear in the Cabi­net that in­cluded a video link to Par­lia­ment House, where Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat and an­other group of min­is­ters were as­sem­bled, in keep­ing with safe dis­tanc­ing re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>Pre­sid­ing over the swear­ing-in cer­e­mony, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob said that the Covid-19 pan­demic has reaf­firmed Sin­ga­pore­ans’ re­silience as one peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“I am proud of how we have stood to­gether, in sol­i­dar­ity with one an­other,” she said. “So for this next phase, I ask Sin­ga­pore­ans to sim­i­larly unite be­hind the Govern­ment that we have elected, and give it our full sup­port to see Sin­ga­pore through this cri­sis.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee noted that the global Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion has taken a turn for the worse. Cities, such as Hong Kong and Seoul, that ini­tially brought the virus un­der con­trol are suf­fer­ing re­peated out­breaks.</p>
    <p>This is why the Govern­ment is building up the ca­pac­ity to test and con­tact trace, so as to stamp out new out­breaks quickly, he said.</p>
    <p>He also pledged to save as many jobs as pos­si­ble and help work­ers who lose jobs to find new work. The Govern­ment will help busi­nesses that have been shut down by the pan­demic to start up again, he said, es­pe­cially in the badly hit con­struc­tion, tourism and avi­a­tion sec­tors.</p>
    <p>But he cau­tioned that some in­dus­tries might fail and work­ers may have to reskill. “The bet­ter, longterm so­lu­tion is to in­vest our re­sources to develop new ca­pa­bil­i­ties, grow new in­dus­tries and cre­ate new jobs. Then we can help firms in de­clin­ing in­dus­tries to rein­vent them­selves or pivot to other fields of busi­ness,” said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>Be­yond eco­nomic pros­per­ity, Sin­ga­pore­ans also want a fair and just so­ci­ety with op­por­tu­ni­ties for all and the hope that their chil­dren would have bet­ter lives than them­selves, he said.</p>
    <p>For this, the po­lit­i­cal sys­tem must con­tinue to work well for Sin­ga­pore, PM Lee added.</p>
    <p>He said the re­cent elec­tion has shown a strong de­sire from Sin­ga­pore­ans for greater di­ver­sity of views in pol­i­tics. This trend, he noted, is here to stay.</p>
    <p>“We have to give ex­pres­sion to it, and evolve our po­lit­i­cal sys­tem to ac­com­mo­date it, while main­tain­ing our co­he­sion and sense of na­tional pur­pose.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee urged the 10 MPs from the Work­ers’ Party, and two NonCon­stituency MPs from the Progress Sin­ga­pore Party, to play their role of a re­spon­si­ble and loyal op­po­si­tion, and put for­ward se­ri­ous pol­icy al­ter­na­tives to be scru­ti­nised and de­bated.</p>
    <p>In all, 33 min­is­ters and min­is­ters of state, start­ing with PM Lee, took their oaths of of­fice, led by Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon, dur­ing the one-hour cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>PM Lee said that good pol­i­tics de­pends not only on sound in­sti­tu­tions, but also on high-qual­ity po­lit­i­cal lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that lead­er­ship re­newal is a “never-end­ing task”, he asked Sin­ga­pore­ans to ex­tend to the younger min­is­ters the same sup­port they have given him over the years.</p>
    <p>“Only with an ex­cep­tional lead­er­ship team, work­ing closely with Sin­ga­pore­ans, can we con­tinue to stand out in the world,” he said.</p>
    <p>I have spent my en­tire adult life in pub­lic ser­vice. I will con­tinue to de­vote my­self to my coun­try and peo­ple, draw­ing strength and pur­pose from the sup­port of Sin­ga­pore­ans, young and old. My aim is to see through this cri­sis, and hand over Sin­ga­pore, in­tact and in work­ing or­der, into good hands who can take the coun­try fur­ther for­ward. I ask Sin­ga­pore­ans to ex­tend to the younger min­is­ters the same sup­port that you have given me all these years.</p>
    <p>PRIME MIN­IS­TER LEE HSIEN LOONG</p>
    <p>While eco­nomic con­di­tions will re­main dif­fi­cult amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, the Govern­ment will do its best to keep Sin­ga­pore­ans em­ployed and give busi­nesses the help they need, said Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
    <p>In a speech yes­ter­day af­ter the new Cabi­net was sworn in, PM Lee out­lined the chal­lenges fac­ing Sin­ga­pore, in­clud­ing the “enor­mous task” of get­ting the coun­try’s econ­omy go­ing again.</p>
    <p>The global coro­n­avirus sit­u­a­tion has wors­ened, he said, with cities that ini­tially brought the virus un­der con­trol – such as Hong Kong and Seoul – suf­fer­ing re­peated out­breaks af­ter eas­ing re­stric­tions and re­open­ing their economies.</p>
    <p>“It shows just how dif­fi­cult it will be for Sin­ga­pore to keep our­selves free from the virus,” he added.</p>
    <p>That is why Sin­ga­pore is building up its test­ing and con­tact trac­ing ca­pac­i­ties, to iden­tify and stamp out new Covid-19 out­breaks quickly as it grad­u­ally re­stores eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity and re­opens its bor­ders.</p>
    <p>PM Lee noted that Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy shrank a record 12.6 per cent year on year in the sec­ond quar­ter this year.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment’s four Bud­gets this year – to the tune of nearly $100 bil­lion – have kept com­pa­nies afloat and min­imised re­trench­ments so far, he said.</p>
    <p>“But eco­nomic con­di­tions will con­tinue to be dif­fi­cult, and we must ex­pect to lose many more jobs,” he added. “We will do our best to save as many as we can, and help work­ers who still lose their jobs to find new work.”</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Jobs Coun­cil, chaired by Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam, is “ur­gently work­ing with the unions, busi­ness as­so­ci­a­tions and govern­ment agen­cies” on the vi­tal task of cre­at­ing jobs and op­por­tu­ni­ties for those out of work, he said.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment will also help busi­nesses that have been shut down by Covid-19 to start up again, he said, point­ing to how it will “lighten the bur­den” of foreign worker levies and fees on com­pa­nies in the con­struc­tion sec­tor, which have been badly af­fected by the Covid-19 out­break in mi­grant worker dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>He added that the Govern­ment is al­most done test­ing all the work­ers for the coro­n­avirus, and clear­ing the dorms of it.</p>
    <p>All is be­ing done to make sure liv­ing and work­ing con­di­tions are safe for these work­ers so that they can get back to work as soon as pos­si­ble, while keep­ing the virus in check, he said.</p>
    <p>“But it is a very com­pli­cated task, and de­spite our best ef­forts, will take a few weeks more to com­plete.”</p>
    <p>Other sec­tors hard hit by the pan­demic are those that de­pend on travel such as tourism and avi­a­tion.</p>
    <p>These sec­tors rely heav­ily on the in­ter­na­tional mar­ket, with­out a large do­mes­tic mar­ket to prop up de­mand.</p>
    <p>“We are de­ter­mined to help these sec­tors pull through, as they are linked to many other parts of our econ­omy,” PM Lee said, not­ing that al­most $2 bil­lion has been set aside in the four Bud­gets to help them.</p>
    <p>Both the Govern­ment and busi­nesses will face dif­fi­cult choices ahead, he said, not­ing that some in­dus­tries will not re­turn to how they were be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We can­not af­ford to prop up fail­ing in­dus­tries in­def­i­nitely, or trap work­ers in jobs that are no longer vi­able,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The bet­ter, long-term so­lu­tion is to in­vest our re­sources to develop new ca­pa­bil­i­ties, grow new in­dus­tries and cre­ate new jobs. Then we can help firms in the de­clin­ing in­dus­tries to rein­vent them­selves or pivot to other fields of busi­ness.”</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment will help work­ers in these in­dus­tries reskill for the new jobs cre­ated, he added.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has to press on with trans­form­ing its econ­omy and skills up­grad­ing, PM Lee said, so that Sin­ga­pore­ans can make the most of new op­por­tu­ni­ties, cope with new un­cer­tain­ties and im­prove their lives.</p>
    <p>“One day, the pan­demic will be over, and the eco­nomic cri­sis will pass. When that day comes, we have to be ready for the postCovid-19 world,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Our aim is not just to sur­vive the storm, but also to set the long-term direc­tion for our coun­try. We must keep on im­prov­ing Sin­ga­pore, year af­ter year, gen­er­a­tion af­ter gen­er­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>There can be no more vivid demon­stra­tion of how our mer­i­to­cratic sys­tem works, and the lengths we have gone to, to en­sure equal treat­ment and op­por­tu­ni­ties for ev­ery cit­i­zen, re­gard­less of race, lan­guage ’’ or re­li­gion.</p>
