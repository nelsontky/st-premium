    <p>WHO Di­vian Nair – one of the hosts of the Maddy, An­dre & Di­vian show, which airs on week­day morn­ings on</p>
    <p>Kiss 92FM – is a man of many hats.</p>
    <p>He sits on the board of the Na­tional Youth Coun­cil and is the chief ex­ec­u­tive and creative di­rec­tor of film company Sto­ry­teller Pro­duc­tions, which he founded in 2015 and where he dreams up scripts and di­rects short films and com­mer­cial videos.</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old, who re­cently mar­ried dig­i­tal mar­keter Rachel Nair, has also been a much-sought-af­ter voiceover tal­ent for the last 10 years for his rich bari­tone.</p>
    <p>Fri­day and Satur­day nights are most valu­able for me be­cause I have the op­tion of stay­ing up at night a lit­tle later than usual, given the un­for­giv­ing sched­ule of my morn­ing shows.</p>
    <p>Rachel and I usu­ally ar­range din­ner with good</p>
    <p>friends and I spend the rest of the night catch­ing up on my hobby, which is play­ing the gui­tar.</p>
    <p>I wish I had the lux­ury of rou­tine when it comes to week­ends, but un­for­tu­nately, I do not.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral times, I have sac­ri­ficed pre­cious per­sonal time for work com­mit­ments, while at other times, I have had to tend to var­i­ous er­rands or prob­lems around the house that need to be fixed. As they say, adult­ing is hard.</p>
    <p>On a good week­end, I will spend most of my time with my wife and our dog Django as well as pay a visit to my par­ents and hope­fully squeeze in some time for close friends.</p>
    <p>On the rare oc­ca­sion when I have more than three un­in­ter­rupted hours, Rachel and I will take Django to ex­plore a new trail.</p>
    <p>My other favourite es­cape is jam ses­sions with one of my friends, where we play the gui­tar and write new songs to­gether.</p>
