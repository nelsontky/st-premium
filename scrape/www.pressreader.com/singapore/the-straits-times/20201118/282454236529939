    <p>When Ms Janet Tay was told she had been re­trenched from her job as a di­rec­tor in a hos­pi­tal­ity com­pany in Septem­ber, the 57-yearold was calm and com­posed.</p>
    <p>But it was very dif­fer­ent for her last year – she was highly stressed at work and eas­ily ir­ri­tated. She also had trou­ble sleep­ing and fre­quent eczema flare-ups.</p>
    <p>To i mprove her health, she joined a meditation pro­gramme at SoulCen­tre in Jan­uary. Since then, she has been prac­tis­ing meditation at least twice daily. It has helped her to calm her mind and man­age her emo­tions bet­ter.</p>
    <p>“I do feel a slight sense of loss (about the re­trench­ment), but it is nat­u­ral. Meditation has helped me to take the emo­tion, process it, think why I am feel­ing this way, recog­nise it, ac­cept it and move on,” said Ms Tay, who is sin­gle.</p>
    <p>Meditation is a prac­tice in which a per­son uses a tech­nique to fo­cus the mind on a par­tic­u­lar ob­ject, thought or ac­tiv­ity so as to train at­ten­tion and aware­ness, and achieve a men­tally clear and emo­tion­ally calm and sta­ble state.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to stud­ies, the ben­e­fits of meditation in­clude re­duced stress and anx­i­ety, lower blood pres­sure, in­creased self-es­teem and bet­ter con­cen­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Across the Asia-Pa­cific, more peo­ple are cop­ing with the Covid-19 pan­demic by turn­ing in­wards and med­i­tat­ing, ac­cord­ing to a study by dig­i­tal health com­pany Fit­bit, which makes health track­ing de­vices.</p>
    <p>A Fit­bit re­search team an­a­lysed ag­gre­gated, anony­mous pop­u­la­tion-level data from mil­lions of Fit­bit users aged 18 to 80 across the globe from March 1 to Aug 31, com­pared with the same pe­riod last year. Th­ese in­cluded data on step counts, ac­tive min­utes and ac­tiv­ity types.</p>
    <p>In the Asia-Pa­cific, a lot more peo­ple took to meditation, yoga and pi­lates this year, the study found, with meditation, in par­tic­u­lar, see­ing mas­sive gains in pop­u­lar­ity among Fit­bit users.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, par­tic­i­pa­tion in meditation among Fit­bit users jumped by a whop­ping 6,128 per cent. Fit­bit was un­able to give a break­down of the num­ber of Sin­ga­pore users in the study.</p>
    <p>Ms Sophia Goh, a coun­sel­lor and psy­chother­a­pist at Sofia Well­ness Clinic, said there has been a greater fo­cus on men­tal well­ness and stress man­age­ment among Sin­ga­pore­ans this year.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing emo­tional dis­tress due to anx­i­ety and fears brought about by the Covid-19 pan­demic, such as un­cer­tainty about the fu­ture, financial chal­lenges, and in­creased fam­ily ten­sion. This ex­plains why more are turn­ing to activities such as meditation to feel calm,” she said.</p>
    <p>At least three meditation cen­tres here, which of­fer a mix of in­per­son and on­line classes, have seen an in­crease in peo­ple tak­ing part in meditation pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>SoulCen­tre, for ex­am­ple, re­ported a 40 per cent in­crease since July, when it reopened.</p>
    <p>Its co-founder and man­ag­ing di­rec­tor, Ms Sally For­rest, said work­ers from the bank­ing, re­tail, and food and bev­er­age sec­tors, as well as doc­tors, are turn­ing to meditation to cope with the chal­leng­ing times.</p>
    <p>“Apart from the stress at work, clients say they are not con­fi­dent liv­ing with the un­known. Peo­ple are used to be­ing in con­trol of their di­aries and plan­ning things and, sud­denly, they can­not do this with confidence,” said Ms For­rest.</p>
    <p>Meditation cen­tre The Golden Space has seen a 25 per cent in­crease in clients since May.</p>
    <p>Ms Yii Hui Lee, a meditation teacher at the cen­tre, said peo­ple have been forced to slow down dur­ing the pan­demic and think about how to take bet­ter care of them­selves.</p>
    <p>She said: “Meditation came up as one of the well­ness op­tions that peo­ple could try. There were many clients who came in feel­ing lost, iso­lated and un­cer­tain about what the fu­ture holds. This caused sad­ness and anx­i­ety and that is when peo­ple turned to meditation.”</p>
    <p>Meditation, she noted, is es­pe­cially help­ful for peo­ple who are emo­tion­ally over­whelmed and tend to sweep their feel­ings or prob­lems un­der the car­pet.</p>
    <p>“The prac­tice al­lows such in­di­vid­u­als to process neg­a­tive emo­tions and re­lease them,” she said.</p>
    <p>With virtual classes now part and par­cel of of­fer­ings at meditation cen­tres, some have had to make ad­just­ments.</p>
    <p>Ms Michele Chong, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor at The Golden Space, who has been con­duct­ing sleep sound ther­apy ses­sions on­line since April, bought four mi­cro­phones to aid her in teach­ing vir­tu­ally.</p>
