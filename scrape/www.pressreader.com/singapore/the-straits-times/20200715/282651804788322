    <p>LONDON • Movie star Johnny Depp on Mon­day con­cluded giv­ing ev­i­dence in his li­bel ac­tion against Bri­tain’s Sun news­pa­per af­ter five days in the wit­ness box.</p>
    <p>He again re­jected ac­cu­sa­tions he had hit his for­mer wife, ac­tress Am­ber Heard, and ac­cused her of us­ing vi­o­lence against him.</p>
    <p>The Pi­rates Of The Caribbean (2003 to 2017) star is su­ing the Sun’s pub­lisher, News Group News­pa­pers, at London’s High Court af­ter the tabloid la­belled him a “wife beater” in a 2018 ar­ti­cle.</p>
    <p>The court has heard ev­i­dence from the pa­per’s lawyer that Depp, 57, vi­o­lently at­tacked Heard on at least 14 oc­ca­sions over three years from 2013, when en­raged by jeal­ousy and hav­ing con­sumed large amounts of al­co­hol or drugs.</p>
    <p>The ac­tor would be­come, ac­cord­ing to Heard, 34, and by his own ac­count, “the mon­ster”, the Sun’s lawyer Sasha Wass told the court.</p>
    <p>Depp re­jected all the al­le­ga­tions that he at­tacked his wife and said</p>
    <p>Heard was l ying, mak­ing up a chore­ographed hoax as part of an “in­sur­ance pol­icy” dossier, and that she had at­tacked him.</p>
    <p>The court was told on Mon­day that one in­ci­dent oc­curred in 2016 af­ter Heard’s 30th birth­day party, which Depp ar­rived at late fol­low­ing a meet­ing with his busi­ness ad­vis­ers.</p>
    <p>At that meet­ing, he was told his pre­vi­ous man­agers had lost US$650 mil­lion he had made from films and he owed US$100 mil­lion be­cause he had not paid any tax for 17 years.</p>
    <p>Ap­pear­ing in the wit­ness box for a fifth day, Depp was asked by his lawyer David Sher­borne about the tran­script of a con­ver­sa­tion the cou­ple had in 2016 af­ter Heard had gone pub­lic with her ac­cu­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>“Ei­ther I’m in a se­cret fight club... (or) I have been plot­ting to do this for three years,” Heard said, ac­cord­ing to Mr Sher­borne. “No one is go­ing to be­lieve that.”</p>
    <p>Depp said he be­lieved what Heard was say­ing was a “re­verse con­fes­sion”.</p>
    <p>“It seemed ev­ery­thing she ac­cused me of was some­thing she had done to me,” he said.</p>
    <p>Heard and Depp met in 2011 while co-star­ring in the film The Rum Di­ary and mar­ried in 2015. Heard filed for di­vorce 15 months later when she first said pub­licly that Depp had abused her and the di­vorce was fi­nalised the fol­low­ing year.</p>
    <p>The court has been shown a num­ber of pic­tures Heard took of her­self with in­juries she says Depp in­flicted.</p>
    <p>Ms Wass said the pho­tos were taken to show the Hol­ly­wood star when he had sobered up and in her wit­ness state­ment, Heard had said she “never imag­ined” they would form part of a court case.</p>
    <p>Depp said he was never shown the pic­tures.</p>
    <p>Heard is due to give ev­i­dence on Fri­day with the trial ex­pected to last three weeks.</p>
