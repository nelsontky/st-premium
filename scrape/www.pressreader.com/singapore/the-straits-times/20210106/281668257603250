    <p>Sev­eral MPs yes­ter­day had ques­tions for Min­is­ter-in-charge of the Smart Na­tion Ini­tia­tive Vi­vian Balakrishn­an and Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam fol­low­ing the dis­clo­sure in Par­lia­ment on Mon­day that TraceTo­gether data can be used in po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions, and yes­ter­day’s clar­i­fi­ca­tion on how it will be used ju­di­ciously. Here are edited ex­cerpts of the ex­change.</p>
    <p>Leader of the Op­po­si­tion Pri­tam Singh (Alju­nied GRC):</p>
    <p>(On the) com­ment Min­is­ter made about the po­lice ju­di­ciously us­ing in­for­ma­tion col­lected by TraceTo­gether, can the Min­is­ter fur­ther ex­plain un­der what cir­cum­stances the po­lice would be call­ing on that in­for­ma­tion?</p>
    <p>The ex­pec­ta­tion can­not be that this in­for­ma­tion would be used at first in­stance when­ever a po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tion com­mences.</p>
    <p>Some clar­i­fi­ca­tion of this would be quite im­por­tant for mem­bers of the pub­lic be­cause ev­ery­body wants TraceTo­gether to suc­ceed in view of the pub­lic health con­sid­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>But this par­tic­u­lar point has caused con­ster­na­tion and that also prob­a­bly ex­plains why Min­is­ter has de­cided to make this clar­i­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam: Un­der Sec­tion 20 of the Crim­i­nal Pro­ce­dure Code (CPC), the po­lice are au­tho­rised to re­cover, seek any i nfor­ma­tion within the pos­ses­sion of a per­son.</p>
    <p>Let’s say there is a mur­der and in­for­ma­tion is avail­able on the TraceTo­gether to­ken. If po­lice choose not to seek that in­for­ma­tion, you can imag­ine how the vic­tim’s family and the rest of Sin­ga­pore might re­act to that. You could even ar­gue that there can be a ju­di­cial re­view ap­pli­ca­tion in such a sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, given that this TraceTo­gether to­ken is nec­es­sary for deal­ing with the epi­demic and it is of na­tional im­por­tance and its pur­poses are to help us deal with the pan­demic, the po­lice ap­proach has been – and will be – that it is pretty much re­stricted to very se­ri­ous of­fences. And while that re­quire­ment is not in the leg­is­la­tion, it will be care­fully con­sid­ered within the po­lice, and dis­cre­tion will be ex­er­cised in seek­ing this in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Christo­pher de Souza (Hol­land-Bukit Timah GRC):</p>
    <p>Will the data be deleted at the end of the in­ves­ti­ga­tions if it doesn’t yield any­thing, or at the end of the case?</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam: If the data is of no par­tic­u­lar use, yes, it will be deleted, oth­er­wise it will have to be pro­duced in court... or used for trial pur­poses even if not pro­duced in court.</p>
    <p>Mr Ger­ald Giam (Alju­nied GRC):</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter Balakrishn­an just said that once the pan­demic has passed, the TraceTo­gether pro­gramme will be stood down. Will t he data that is col­lected, in­clud­ing data that is beyond 25 days, will that be stored on a server and will that still be ac­ces­si­ble by the po­lice if they in­voke the CPC?</p>
    <p>And has the Gov­ern­ment con­sid­ered the im­pact that yes­ter­day’s clar­i­fi­ca­tion would have on the adop­tion and the us­age of the TraceTo­gether app as well as the to­ken, be­cause although we might have 78 per cent adop­tion, there is no real way of find­ing out whether peo­ple are ac­tu­ally us­ing the sys­tem?</p>
    <p>Dr Balakrishn­an: First, let me deal with the data in your phones and in your to­kens. All that is en­crypted and it is auto purged af­ter 25 days. So, you don’t need to wait for the end of the pan­demic be­fore your longer-term his­tor­i­cal data, beyond 25 days, is auto deleted.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, what im­pact does all this open dis­cus­sion have on par­tic­i­pa­tion and on the way we han­dle the pan­demic it­self? There were peo­ple who said: “Well, you have got a tool, make it com­pul­sory, just en­force it. This is a clear and present emer­gency.” And Mem­bers will re­call that on nu­mer­ous oc­ca­sions in this House and out­side, I have asked that to the max­i­mum ex­tent, I am go­ing to try to make this vol­un­tary – a much harder tar­get, an ap­proach which re­quires con­stant ex­pla­na­tion, and some­times I will get it wrong. And when I get it wrong, I will just come clean and say so.</p>
    <p>You should be ask­ing me: Why do you take such a leceh, la­bo­ri­ous ap­proach? And that is be­cause I be­lieve that our vic­tory over this pan­demic is not by us sit­ting up here is­su­ing rules and edicts, but that our peo­ple must un­der­stand not only the mea­sures that we are im­ple­ment­ing, but why we are im­ple­ment­ing it, the spirit be­hind it, so that with their un­der­stand­ing and vol­un­tary and full co­op­er­a­tion, we can achieve suc­cess.</p>
    <p>And the rea­son we are now in this happy sit­u­a­tion, in stark con­trast to vir­tu­ally any­where else in the world, is not just be­cause we have got two won­der­ful co-chair­men, Min­is­ter Gan (Kim Yong) and Mr Lawrence Wong, and it is not be­cause we have got such tech­no­log­i­cal wiz­ardry, but it is trust, it is un­der­stand­ing, it is co­op­er­a­tion and it is col­lec­tive re­spon­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>So, the pur­pose of the answer to the question yes­ter­day by Min­is­ter of State (for Home Af­fairs) Des­mond Tan is that we want to be com­pletely above board and trans­par­ent. The rea­son I asked Speaker’s per­mis­sion to make this clar­i­fi­ca­tion is be­cause of this.</p>
    <p>If there is disquiet, if there is un­cer­tainty, we must answer it. We must be forth­right, hon­est, open, trans­par­ent... It is in that spirit that we have these open dis­cus­sions and why I re­main con­fi­dent that the par­tic­i­pa­tion rate in con­tact trac­ing us­ing the lat­est tools that we have will re­main high, and why I hope we will con­tinue to be one of the bright spots in the world.</p>
    <p>I ap­peal to you, by all means, con­tinue to push us, ask us, question us, dis­agree with us. This is the at­ti­tude by which we will make progress and over­come.</p>
    <p>Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPher­son):</p>
    <p>The TraceTo­gether to­ken does not have the GPS func­tion and the data will be deleted af­ter 25 days.</p>
    <p>For the hand­phone app, be­cause the hand­phone it­self has GPS func­tion, would this also ap­ply to the TT ap­pli­ca­tions on phones?</p>
    <p>Next, the po­lice have a range of ways of col­lect­ing the data or in­for­ma­tion that they need for crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions. Given the ex­changes of Blue­tooth in­for­ma­tion, how is the data from TraceTo­gether use­ful to po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tion into crimes?</p>
    <p>Lastly, I would like to ask Min­is­ter for his reaf­fir­ma­tion that the vast ma­jor­ity of Sin­ga­pore­ans will not be af­fected by this.</p>
    <p>Dr Balakrishn­an: First, the to­ken has no GPS chip, and we have opened it up, we have al­lowed ex­ter­nal par­ties to dis­sem­ble it. So, there is no way the to­ken can keep track of lo­ca­tion. Ms Tin makes the point that most smart­phones nowa­days do have a GPS chip. But we have been very care­ful in our cod­ing for the TraceTo­gether app that it does not keep a record of GPS lo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>The only thing the TraceTo­gether app keeps track of is prox­im­ity on the ba­sis of Blue­tooth data.</p>
    <p>On your sec­ond question whether this is use­ful, that is an op­er­a­tional question which I will leave to the po­lice – whether prox­im­ity data is use­ful or not, and how they would use it.</p>
    <p>Your fi­nal question was on the as­sur­ance that the ma­jor­ity will not be af­fected. The vast ma­jor­ity of Sin­ga­pore­ans are not in­volved in or as­sist­ing in crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions. In that sense, they are not af­fected.</p>
    <p>But TraceTo­gether, and its suc­cess, af­fects the wel­fare and the pub­lic health of all of us.</p>
    <p>And in that sense, con­fi­dence in this pro­gramme makes a dif­fer­ence to all of us.</p>
    <p>Non-Con­stituency MP Leong Mun Wai:</p>
    <p>How many in­stances are there where the po­lice have tapped the data from the TraceTo­gether app?</p>
    <p>I would also like the Min­is­ter to clar­ify fur­ther, when did he dis­cover that his state­ment (on TraceTo­gether be­ing used only for con­tact trac­ing) is go­ing to be af­fected by the CPC?</p>
    <p>Two, his mes­sage to­day, is it (that) he wants to apol­o­gise that the Gov­ern­ment or the Min­is­ter had made an over­sight, or is he telling us that in Sin­ga­pore, we should just take it that un­der the CPC, they will be able to ac­cess all the in­for­ma­tion they have on us?</p>
    <p>Dr Balakrishn­an: As far as I am aware, there has been only one, which in­volved a mur­der case. But I am not privy to op­er­a­tional de­tails, and I shouldn’t be, and there­fore I am not in a po­si­tion to com­ment fur­ther on the in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>(When) I made the com­ments and state­ments ear­lier, the CPC was not in my mind. Sub­se­quently, we have been hav­ing dis­cus­sions, es­pe­cially over the last few weeks, as to whether we should in fact change the law or whether we con­tinue as we are now. In any case, we de­cided it is bet­ter to be up­front.</p>
    <p>That is why we are very glad Mr de Souza asked the question and Min­is­ter of State Des­mond Tan an­swered it yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>I have been in the House now for al­most 20 years and all the staff who have worked with me over the years will know that I am ob­ses­sively con­cerned with ac­cu­racy, need­less to say, ab­so­lute ad­her­ence to hon­esty. And that means over the years, from time to time, when I have mis­spo­ken, I have said so.</p>
    <p>I have never shied away from say­ing so be­cause, as I said, it is far more im­por­tant to main­tain trust. And I might be right or I might be wrong or I might have mis­taken some­thing or over­looked some­thing, but rest as­sured when I dis­cover it, I will say so, and to the best ex­tent pos­si­ble, we will find a so­lu­tion to­gether.</p>
    <p>That is my ap­proach, and I don’t see any need to change from that, and I hope you un­der­stand.</p>
    <p>Mr Mu­rali Pil­lai (Bukit Ba­tok):</p>
    <p>I re­call Mr Giam, in the de­bate on the Per­sonal Data Pro­tec­tion (Amend­ment) Bill, raised the pos­si­bil­ity of link­ing the stan­dards un­der the Per­sonal Data Pro­tec­tion Act (PDPA) and the gov­ern­ment stan­dards in re­la­tion to data pro­tec­tion with the Gen­eral Data Pro­tec­tion Reg­u­la­tion (GDPR) of the Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>Now, as far as the gen­eral data pro­tec­tion reg­u­la­tions of the EU are con­cerned, there is a carve-out in re­la­tion to po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>In fact, po­lice may ac­cess per­sonal data in re­la­tion to de­tec­tion, preven­tion, in­ves­ti­ga­tion as well as pros­e­cu­tion for crim­i­nal of­fences. So, in a sense, there is par­ity in re­la­tion to the Sin­ga­pore sit­u­a­tion with that of the sit­u­a­tion in the EU.</p>
    <p>Mr Giam: My pur­pose for rais­ing that in­ter­ven­tion yes­ter­day was mainly in the in­ter­est of max­imis­ing the adop­tion of TraceTo­gether.</p>
    <p>I have been a strong ad­vo­cate of it on the ground with my res­i­dents, in the face of quite a bit of scep­ti­cism about the sys­tem. And I have ac­tu­ally tried to con­vince peo­ple to not only use the to­ken, but also use the app, and use the app in­stead of us­ing the to­ken if they have a mo­bile phone. I just want to put on record that I do sup­port the TraceTo­gether sys­tem and I do en­cour­age Sin­ga­pore­ans to use the to­ken or the app as much as they can.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to Mr Mu­rali’s point about the GDPR and the PDPA, I don’t in­tend to open up a whole de­bate about this, but just to clar­ify that what I said dur­ing the de­bate was that the GDPR does have carve-outs for se­cu­rity pur­poses.</p>
    <p>So, it is pos­si­ble to have a PDPA that has carve-outs that al­low the po­lice to do cer­tain things and ac­cess cer­tain data. So, it is not in­con­gru­ent to what I said ear­lier on.</p>
