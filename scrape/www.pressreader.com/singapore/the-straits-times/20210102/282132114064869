    <p>If last year was the Year of Covid-19, this year may well be called the Year of the Vac­cine. The first batch of vac­cines has ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore, and in­oc­u­la­tion has be­gun. And as Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said in his New Year mes­sage, we can now see light at the end of the tunnel. Af­ter the per­va­sive dark­ness that filled the tunnel for al­most 12 months, the vac­cines carry the hope of med­i­cal recovery from a dis­ease that has bat­tered per­sonal and so­cial lives, and the econ­omy. For­tu­nately, the fa­tal­ity rate has been very low in Sin­ga­pore, un­like in na­tions where the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has cut a deeper swathe through large seg­ments of the pop­u­la­tion. Nev­er­the­less, Sin­ga­pore­ans suf­fered like ev­ery­one else.</p>
    <p>Look­ing ahead, the fruits of sta­bil­ity, achieved painstak­ingly over a year of so­cial and eco­nomic con­trac­tion, should be­come avail­able for en­joy­ment by Sin­ga­pore­ans. True, it will take time for suf­fi­cient numbers of peo­ple to be vac­ci­nated be­fore Sin­ga­pore is safe from another ma­jor un­con­trolled out­break. But that is a re­al­is­able goal be­cause of the avail­abil­ity of vac­cines. What also mat­ters is the will­ing­ness of Sin­ga­pore­ans and oth­ers who are el­i­gi­ble to go for in­oc­u­la­tions in­stead of be­ing held back by non-med­i­cal con­cerns – and mis­in­for­ma­tion. It stands to rea­son that the ef­fec­tive­ness of the vac­cines in­cludes their safety. The sooner ev­ery­one here can en­joy col­lec­tive pro­tec­tion from Covid-19, the sooner they will feel safe and com­fort­able enough to fully re­sume work and other ac­tiv­i­ties, al­beit with changes. Re­al­is­ti­cally, there is no like­li­hood of re­turn­ing to the days and rou­tines be­fore the pan­demic struck. Mea­sures such as safe dis­tanc­ing and mask wear­ing con­tinue to be nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans should also not as­sume that Covid-19 was merely an episodic at­tack on the fab­ric of life that has passed. In­stead, a new nor­mal is here to stay. It re­quires be­ing con­stantly on alert, and a mind­set that does not set­tle back into com­pla­cency sim­ply be­cause the out­break ap­pears to have been con­tained. The new nor­mal will also help pre­pare Sin­ga­pore­ans psy­cho­log­i­cally for a fu­ture marked by epi­demi­o­log­i­cal un­cer­tain­ties.</p>
    <p>Nascent signs of eco­nomic recovery have ap­peared, with em­ploy­ment hav­ing picked up and multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tions mak­ing sig­nif­i­cant new in­vest­ments in Sin­ga­pore. Un­for­tu­nately, the recovery will be un­even, and eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity is likely to re­main be­low pre-Covid-19 lev­els for some time. But the sur­vival of the so­cial ecosys­tem in the past year should add mo­men­tum to the re­bound ex­pected this year. So, too, the public trust in the work­ings of the au­thor­i­ties as they fought back the pan­demic, and the resilience of the tri­par­tite sys­tem of col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween unions, em­ploy­ers and govern­ment. All these en­sured that the Sin­ga­pore sys­tem held in dif­fi­cult times. A bet­ter year is now in sight.</p>
