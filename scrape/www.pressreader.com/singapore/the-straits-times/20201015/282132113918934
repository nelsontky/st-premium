    <p>Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings (SPH) shares sank yes­ter­day af­ter the me­dia and prop­erty group fell into the red for the first time and slashed its div­i­dend pay­out.</p>
    <p>The counter shed 5.2 per cent, or 5.5 cents, to 99.5 cents in early trade – the first time it has dipped be­low $1 – but re­gained a lit­tle mo­men­tum to close at $1, down 4.76 per cent, with 44 mil­lion shares done.</p>
    <p>The board de­clared a final div­i­dend of one cent a share on Tues­day, markedly down on last year’s 5.5 cent pay­out with a spe­cial div­i­dend of one cent.</p>
    <p>An in­terim div­i­dend of 1.5 cents brings the to­tal pay­out for this fi­nan­cial year to 2.5 cents.</p>
    <p>SPH, which pub­lishes The Straits Times and The Busi­ness Times, among other ti­tles, posted a net loss of $83.7 mil­lion for the 12 months to Aug 31, re­vers­ing the net profit of $213.2 mil­lion a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>It took a hit from non-cash fair­value losses of $232 mil­lion – mostly on its malls and pur­pose­built stu­dent ac­com­mo­da­tion as­sets, while the me­dia busi­ness con­tin­ued to be hurt by de­clin­ing ad­ver­tis­ing turnover.</p>
    <p>Me­dia turnover shrank 22.8 per cent to $445.1 mil­lion for the year, ow­ing to a fall in news­pa­per print ad rev­enue.</p>
    <p>Losses be­fore tax for the seg­ment were $11.4 mil­lion, com­pared with a profit of $54.7 mil­lion last year, af­ter fac­tor­ing in re­trench­ment costs of $16.6 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Prop­erty posted a bet­ter show­ing, ris­ing 10.3 per cent to $327.2 mil­lion. But the loss be­fore tax was $75.8 mil­lion, com­pared with a profit of $263 mil­lion last year, due to the fair-value losses.</p>
    <p>DBS Bank an­a­lysts Al­fie Yeo and Andy Sim have main­tained their “hold” rat­ing on SPH but low­ered their tar­get price from $1.26 to $1.09, as they ex­pect weak­ness to per­sist in the me­dia seg­ment.</p>
    <p>The group’s core rev­enue fell within ex­pec­ta­tions, but core op­er­at­ing profit came in short, ow­ing to higher-than-ex­pected op­er­at­ing costs, Mr Yeo and Mr Sim said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We ex­pect me­dia to con­tinue to be a drag in the im­me­di­ate term, given the weak ad­ver­tis­ing ex­pen­di­ture out­look, with (the) prop­erty seg­ment driv­ing earn­ings growth and mar­gins,” they wrote.</p>
    <p>This back­drop has prompted them to lower their fore­casts for earn­ings next year to 2022 by 7 per cent to 18 per cent, af­ter fac­tor­ing in lower op­er­at­ing mar­gins.</p>
    <p>How­ever, they re­main bullish on the group’s prop­erty busi­ness. “We see prop­erty driv­ing earn­ings growth in the longer term, con­tribut­ing to bet­ter mar­gins from the 2022 (fi­nan­cial year).”</p>
