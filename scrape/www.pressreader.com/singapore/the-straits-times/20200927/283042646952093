    <p>In a world of low-wage pres­sure, Sin­ga­pore work­ers have been for­tu­nate to have their pay keep on ris­ing. Just look at the fig­ures.</p>
    <p>Over the past two decades, nom­i­nal me­dian wages for Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents – cit­i­zens and per­ma­nent res­i­dents (PRs) – have out­paced gen­eral cost of liv­ing pres­sures.</p>
    <p>Cu­mu­la­tively, real me­dian gross monthly in­come of full-time em­ployed Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents, in­clud­ing em­ployer Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund con­tri­bu­tions, has risen by 32.5 per cent be­tween 2009 and last year.</p>
    <p>High­light­ing this in July, Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam said: “Very few coun­tries at the same level of de­vel­op­ment as Sin­ga­pore, the same ad­vanced coun­try lev­els, have seen that con­tin­u­ous in­crease in in­comes.”</p>
    <p>But while wages are keep­ing up, or even out­strip­ping in­fla­tion­ary pres­sures, real me­dian wage growth does not nec­es­sar­ily mean that Sin­ga­pore work­ers have higher liv­ing stan­dards, or con­sider them­selves bet­ter off than work­ers two decades ago.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Uni­ver­sity of So­cial Sci­ences economist Wal­ter Th­e­seira points out: “Me­dian wage growth is not the same thing as wages go­ing up for ev­ery worker in the econ­omy.”</p>
    <p>Rather, it re­flects the change in the me­dian wage of all the peo­ple who re­ported in­comes in one year, com­pared with the pre­vi­ous year.</p>
    <p>But the group of peo­ple draw­ing wages in the two years can be dif­fer­ent, he says.</p>
    <p>“In Sin­ga­pore’s case, the par­tic­u­lar is­sue we have to be aware of is that the na­ture of that group of peo­ple, year to year, changes sys­tem­at­i­cally be­cause of the very sig­nif­i­cant dif­fer­ence in ed­u­ca­tion and work pro­files be­tween young Sin­ga­pore­ans en­ter­ing the work­force and old Sin­ga­pore­ans leav­ing,” As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Th­e­seira notes.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, me­dian wage changes also take into ac­count the ad­di­tion of new cit­i­zens and new PRs, who are al­most al­ways earn­ing a higher wage than the av­er­age Sin­ga­porean, he adds.</p>
    <p>BET­TER WAGES, BET­TER LIV­ING?</p>
    <p>Ms Se­lena Ling, head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy at OCBC Bank, high­lights how ex­pec­ta­tions about qual­ity of life have also evolved.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, hav­ing Wi-Fi con­nec­tion, com­put­ers and smart­phones may be more im­por­tant than hav­ing a tele­vi­sion set or a land­line, and the con­cept of 5Cs – tra­di­tion­ally cash, car, credit card, con­do­minium and coun­try club mem­ber­ship – may also have changed with time.</p>
    <p>Dr Chew Soon Beng, se­nior as­so­ci­ate at the Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Uni­ver­sity’s Cen­tre for Lib­eral Arts and So­cial Sci­ences, also urges look­ing be­yond cost prices to con­sider quan­ti­ties too.</p>
    <p>He says: “In other words, if price is con­stant, but peo­ple need to buy more, the cost of liv­ing is higher. Why the higher quan­tity?</p>
    <p>“One rea­son is that food prices per unit might be the same, but food quan­tity per unit has re­duced. The other rea­son is demon­stra­tion ef­fect – keep­ing up with the Jone­ses.”</p>
    <p>HOUS­ING AS­PI­RA­TIONS</p>
    <p>Pay­ing the same amount – or in some cases, more – for a smaller quan­tity is ev­i­dent in hous­ing.</p>
    <p>Fewer five-room Hous­ing Board flats have been re­leased in the last five years and, even so, they are con­cen­trated in non-ma­ture es­tates rather than prime ar­eas.</p>
    <p>This is due to lim­ited land for new hous­ing in cen­tral ar­eas, an HDB spokesman said in re­sponse to queries from The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>What does this mean for the Sin­ga­porean cou­ple as­pir­ing to­wards a larger five-room flat in a cen­tral area?</p>
    <p>Given the lim­ited sup­ply, they may have to turn to the re­sale mar­ket, which means higher prices, or move far­ther out to non-ma­ture es­tates, which most would con­sider less de­sir­able.</p>
    <p>But what about those who con­sider lo­ca­tion fore­most?</p>
    <p>Their op­tion is a smaller, four­room flat that is about 90 sq m, com­pared with the typ­i­cal 110 sq m five­room unit.</p>
    <p>Elab­o­rat­ing on the pres­sures Sin­ga­pore­ans face, Prof Th­e­seira stresses that it is not about go­ing on va­ca­tions or out for meals.</p>
    <p>“It is the need to keep up so­cially, not just in terms of con­sump­tion, but also what is per­ceived as nec­es­sary in­vest­ments for the fu­ture,” he says, not­ing that a lot of angst is cen­tred on ex­pen­di­ture de­ci­sions sur­round­ing chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, do Sin­ga­porean work­ers con­sider them­selves to be en­joy­ing higher stan­dards of liv­ing, given the Repub­lic’s sig­nif­i­cant real me­dian wage growth over the years?</p>
    <p>Dr Chew sug­gests this is not the case.</p>
    <p>“Many Sin­ga­porean work­ers would say they are worse off. They might earn the same but need to spend more,” he says.</p>
    <p>“They might earn the same, but need to put in more hours.”</p>
