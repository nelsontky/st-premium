    <p>LON­DON • Diogo Jota has ad­mit­ted that Liver­pool man­ager Ju­r­gen Klopp’s ad­vice was vi­tal in help­ing him find a way into the Reds’ starstud­ded at­tack.</p>
    <p>The Por­tuguese for­ward, who has scored nine goals in 15 games in all com­pe­ti­tions since join­ing Liver­pool from Wolver­hamp­ton Wan­der­ers in the close sea­son, is set to face his for­mer team for the first time when they visit An­field to­day.</p>
    <p>“When you reach a new club, hav­ing an open mind is key to be able to adapt as quickly as pos­si­ble,” Jota said ahead of the Premier League clash.</p>
    <p>“I did that with the help of Ju­r­gen. He’s a fan­tas­tic man­ager who took care of me. When I first ar­rived, he had a meet­ing with me and he ex­plained how the team works.</p>
    <p>“Then it’s down to the player to try to learn as fast as you can and to prove to the man­ager that you can be an im­por­tant player for him.”</p>
    <p>The 24-year-old has had an im­pres­sive start, over­shad­ow­ing Liver­pool’s famed at­tack­ing trio of Mo­hamed Salah, Sa­dio Mane and Roberto Firmino. Salah has scored 10 goals in 16 games, while Firmino has two in 16, and Mane five in 15.</p>
    <p>Jota is also the only for­ward who has scored in four of Liver­pool’s last five league games.</p>
    <p>Pun­dit Owen Har­g­reaves sug­gested com­pe­ti­tion could be brew­ing be­tween Jota, Salah and Mane.</p>
    <p>“If ev­ery­body is try­ing to have a shot when they get the ball – Salah, Jota and Mane – I think you’re go­ing to start see­ing a slight bit of ten­sion,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Reds, who al­ready have a lengthy in­jury list, beat Ajax 1-0 in the Cham­pi­ons League on Tues­day with An­drew Robert­son and Jor­dan Hen­der­son both pick­ing up knocks.</p>
    <p>But Klopp con­firmed that the in­juries are not se­ri­ous and they are in con­tention to face Wolves.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Wolver­hamp­ton boss Nuno Espir­ito Santo has lauded Jota for hit­ting the ground run­ning at Liver­pool.</p>
    <p>“We are proud and happy Diogo is do­ing well. He is a fan­tas­tic player and a fan­tas­tic boy,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We know his char­ac­ter­is­tics but we are go­ing to face Liver­pool so we have to be aware of their qual­i­ties, Diogo plus all the other tal­ented play­ers Liver­pool have.”</p>
    <p>Nuno added that Raul Jimenez is mak­ing ex­cel­lent progress fol­low­ing surgery on a frac­tured skull but it was too early to set a time­frame for the Mex­i­can striker’s re­turn.</p>
    <p>Jimenez, 29, was in­jured af­ter a clash of heads with Arse­nal de­fender David Luiz at the Emi­rates Sta­dium last Sun­day. He re­ceived lengthy treat­ment on the pitch be­fore be­ing taken off and rushed to hos­pi­tal and could be dis­charged as early as this week.</p>
