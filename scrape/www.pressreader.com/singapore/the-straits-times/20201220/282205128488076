    <p>Vir­tual fit­ness be­came part of the new nor­mal as gyms here were forced to take their fit­ness classes on­line dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, when many busi­nesses had to shut to curb the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Gym­go­ers were quick to adapt by tun­ing into live or pre-recorded work­out classes from home (be­low).</p>
    <p>As vir­tual fit­ness classes gained pop­u­lar­ity, so did home fit­ness equip­ment. Re­tail­ers en­joyed a surge in sales of prod­ucts such as yoga mats and train­ing bands.</p>
    <p>In April, na­tional sports body Sport Sin­ga­pore launched Ac­tiveSG Cir­cle to pro­vide a plat­form for the public to ac­cess on­line classes, such as yoga or strength-train­ing classes.</p>
    <p>True Group, which con­sists of fit­ness chains True Fit­ness, TFX and GFX, has also been of­fer­ing a wide range of classes on social media to its mem­bers. Th­ese in­clude zumba, pi­lates and high-in­ten­sity in­ter­val train­ing classes.</p>
    <p>Since July, it has been live-stream­ing some phys­i­cal classes via video­con­fer­enc­ing plat­form Zoom to al­low more mem­bers to work out from home due to caps on the num­ber of peo­ple who can at­tend fit­ness classes in per­son.</p>
    <p>True Group chief ex­ec­u­tive Ken Mok says there was “a huge spike” in view­er­ship of its on-de­mand classes dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker and the strong view­er­ship con­tin­ued well into Au­gust. “Apart from the re­stric­tions on class ca­pac­ity, peo­ple may also have got used to the con­ve­nience of work­ing out from their own home as it helps to re­duce trav­el­ling time,” he says.</p>
    <p>Mixed-mar­tial arts chain Evolve MMA has been con­duct­ing vir­tual classes in muay thai, box­ing and Brazil­ian jiu-jitsu via Zoom and its social media chan­nels.</p>
    <p>Mr Wes­ley De Souza, vice-pres­i­dent of Evolve MMA, sees the trend of on­line fit­ness classes con­tin­u­ing even when the pan­demic ends. “The pan­demic has ac­cel­er­ated the move to­wards on­line fit­ness and made it pos­si­ble for peo­ple to keep up a fit­ness rou­tine at their own time and pace. It has al­lowed fit­ness rou­tines and reg­i­mens to be­come a lot more ac­ces­si­ble. We don’t think that’s go­ing away any time soon.”</p>
