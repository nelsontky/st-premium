    <p>The clo­sure of in­ter­na­tional bor­ders, flight caps and quar­an­tine pro­ce­dures ow­ing to Covid-19 pose a grave threat to global ship­ping sup­ply chains and the wel­fare of sea­far­ers, the head of Aus­tralia’s mar­itime safety au­thor­ity has warned.</p>
    <p>Mr Mick Kin­ley, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Aus­tralian Mar­itime Safety Au­thor­ity (Amsa), said there was an in­creas­ing risk that the global ship­ping in­dus­try could “grind to a halt” or se­ri­ous ac­ci­dents oc­cur be­cause of the ex­treme pres­sure on crew, some of whom have not set foot on land for 17 months.</p>
    <p>“If we don’t deal with this prob­lem, then even­tu­ally they (sea­far­ers) could down tools. So we have to keep on top of it and we have to keep work­ing on it,” he told the Fi­nan­cial Times.</p>
    <p>The in­ter­na­tional ship­ping in­dus­try is re­spon­si­ble for about 90 per cent of the car­riage of global trade.</p>
    <p>Since the end of June, Amsa has de­tained seven ships vis­it­ing Aus­tralian ports be­cause of al­leged breaches of mar­itime reg­u­la­tions and last week banned a bulk car­rier, Uni­son Jasper, for six months.</p>
    <p>In some in­stances, ships have been un­able to leave port ow­ing to the dif­fi­culty of re­plac­ing crew, who have asked the au­thor­i­ties to help them to be al­lowed off ves­sels.</p>
    <p>Re­stric­tions at ports around the world on ships dock­ing to change crew – an es­sen­tial process within the day-to-day run­ning of the in­dus­try – have meant that huge num­bers of sea­far­ers have been un­able to re­turn home this year.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Cham­ber of Ship­ping has re­cently es­ti­mated that 250,000 sea­far­ers are stuck at sea, be­yond their con­tracts.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Mar­itime Labour Con­ven­tion, a bind­ing in­ter­na­tional reg­u­la­tion, the max­i­mum pe­riod sea­far­ers should serve on­board a ves­sel with­out leave is 11 months.</p>
    <p>Mr Kin­ley said Covid-19 travel re­stric­tions on a global level were mak­ing it dif­fi­cult for sea­far­ers to get to their home na­tions when they com­pleted their con­tracts or for re­place­ment crew to get on to ships to meet min­i­mum crew re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>Can­berra’s de­ci­sion to close state bor­ders had added an ex­tra layer of com­plex­ity to the is­sue, he said.</p>
    <p>Some ship­ping com­pa­nies are do­ing their best to repa­tri­ate for­eign sailors — many of whom are from In­dia or the Philip­pines — and re­place crew while oth­ers are flout­ing reg­u­la­tions, said Mr Kin­ley, who has or­dered a crack­down on rogue op­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>Amsa has un­der­taken 600 port inspection­s since June 26 and re­ceived 104 com­plaints from one or more crew mem­bers about al­leged vi­o­la­tions of mar­itime reg­u­la­tions. More than three-quar­ters of those com­plaints in­volved crew spend­ing longer than 11 months on board with­out leave.</p>
    <p>“We’ve seen in­stances where some of these poor guys have been on the ship for 17 months. And that’s not good for any­body in that en­vi­ron­ment. It’s con­stant fa­tigue – sys­temic fa­tigue builds up. Ev­ery­one in the in­dus­try is con­cerned that this will man­i­fest into in­ci­dents,” said Mr Kin­ley.</p>
    <p>He added that some peo­ple in the in­dus­try were al­ready spec­u­lat­ing that fa­tigue could have played a role in the ground­ing of the MV Wakashio in Mau­ri­tius, which led to a cat­a­strophic oil spill in July.</p>
    <p>Men­tal health and sui­cide were big con­cerns for fa­tigued sea­far­ers, said Mr Kin­ley.</p>
    <p>Last month, Amsa banned two Liberian flagged tankers, Agia</p>
    <p>Sofia and TW Ham­burg, for al­leged sys­tem­atic un­der­pay­ment of sea­far­ers.</p>
    <p>Last week, it banned the Union Jasper – a ship trans­port­ing alu­mina to a smelter jointly owned by Rio Tinto, CSR and Hy­dro Alu­minium – for al­leged breaches of reg­u­la­tions re­gard­ing wages, food and em­ploy­ment agree­ments.</p>
    <p>Rio Tinto and CSR did not re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment about the Union Jasper.</p>
    <p>Uni­son Marine Cor­po­ra­tion did not re­ply to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Dean Sum­mers of the In­ter­na­tional Trans­port Work­ers’ Fed­er­a­tion said con­di­tions for sea­far­ers stuck on board ves­sels for up to 18 months was edg­ing to­wards “mod­ern day slav­ery”.</p>
    <p>Ship own­ers, char­ter­ers and gov­ern­ments needed to do more to pro­tect crew and en­sure safety and the main­te­nance of vi­tal sup­ply chains, he said.</p>
