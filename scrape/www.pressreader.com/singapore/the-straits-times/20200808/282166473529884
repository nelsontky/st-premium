    <p>There is al­ways a lit­tle bit of magic in science, and this year’s Sin­ga­pore Science Fes­ti­val seems to be tak­ing this to heart, cap­ping its two-week run on­line with a sim­ple home ex­per­i­ment ev­ery­one can join in per­form­ing.</p>
    <p>A bowl of milk, a few drops of food dye and a dash of dish­wash­ing liq­uid are all it takes to cre­ate a colour­ful, mar­bled art piece.</p>
    <p>The ex­per­i­ment, dubbed Magic Milk, is a high­light of this year’s fes­ti­val, which ends to­day.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers are hop­ing to set a record for the “most num­ber of peo­ple do­ing a science ex­per­i­ment to­gether on an on­line plat­form”. Here’s how the ex­per­i­ment works. First, add droplets of food dye to the milk in a shal­low plate.</p>
    <p>The food dye will sit on the sur­face in­stead of mix­ing – the milk is caus­ing this as it ex­hibits sur­face ten­sion, form­ing a film on the sur­face of the liq­uid which be­comes a bar­rier against the food dye.</p>
    <p>Then, to weaken this film and to al­low the dif­fer­ent colours to blend, a chem­i­cal re­ac­tion is ini­ti­ated us­ing dish­wash­ing soap.</p>
    <p>As milk is made up of wa­ter, fat and pro­teins, the soap mol­e­cules sep­a­rate the wa­ter and fat in it – the hy­dropho­bic, or wa­ter-re­pelling, end of the soap mol­e­cules bind with the fat mol­e­cules in the milk, while the hy­drophilic, or wa­ter-lov­ing, end of the soap mol­e­cules bind with the wa­ter mol­e­cules.</p>
    <p>This ex­plains why when a cot­ton bud coated with soap is dipped into the bowl, the soap mol­e­cules race around try­ing to bind with the fat mol­e­cules, push­ing the food dye mol­e­cules in all direc­tions, caus­ing an ex­plo­sion of colour.</p>
    <p>The move­ment even­tu­ally stops when all the fat mol­e­cules bind with the soap mol­e­cules.</p>
    <p>For the best ef­fect, use milk with high fat con­tent.</p>
    <p>A science ed­u­ca­tor from Science Cen­tre Sin­ga­pore will be con­duct­ing the ex­per­i­ment on­line, and par­tic­i­pants are en­cour­aged to turn on their video func­tion and con­duct the ex­per­i­ment si­mul­ta­ne­ously in their own homes.</p>
    <p>The event is jointly or­gan­ised by Science Cen­tre Sin­ga­pore and the Agency for Science, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search in col­lab­o­ra­tion with the Sin­ga­pore Book of Records.</p>
    <p>Science Cen­tre chief ex­ec­u­tive Lim Tit Meng said: “In line with this year’s theme, Em­pow­ered by Science, the Magic Milk ex­per­i­ment in­vites bud­ding sci­en­tists and cu­ri­ous minds, young and old alike, to dis­cover how science shapes our lives in amaz­ing ways.”</p>
    <p>The ex­per­i­ment will be con­ducted from 4pm to 5pm to­day. Par­tic­i­pants can sign up at the Sin­ga­pore Science Fes­ti­val Facebook page.</p>
