    <p>WASHINGTON • US Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence and his Demo­cratic chal­lenger, Se­na­tor Ka­mala Har­ris, will be sep­a­rated by a plex­i­glass bar­rier dur­ing their de­bate to­day in an ef­fort to lower the risk of coro­n­avirus trans­mis­sion, the com­mis­sion over­see­ing the event said.</p>
    <p>The de­bate, the only one sched­uled be­tween the vice-pres­i­den­tial can­di­dates, is sched­uled to be held in Salt Lake City, six days af­ter Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump an­nounced he had con­tracted the virus.</p>
    <p>Both Ms Har­ris and Mr Pence have tested neg­a­tive for the virus in re­cent days, with the Repub­li­can Vice-Pres­i­dent work­ing from home over the week­end in­stead of at the White House.</p>
    <p>A num­ber of White House staff and prom­i­nent Repub­li­cans, in­clud­ing three US sen­a­tors, have tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The com­mis­sion on pres­i­den­tial de­bates said the two would be seated more than 3.7m apart.</p>
    <p>Also, there will be a lim­ited num­ber of guests at the de­bate, all of whom will un­dergo test­ing, and any­one who does not wear a mask will be “es­corted out”.</p>
    <p>At the first pres­i­den­tial de­bate be­tween Mr Trump and Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den last week, sev­eral mem­bers of Mr Trump’s fam­ily did not wear masks while sit­ting in the au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, Mr Pence’s spokesman, Ms Katie Miller, said: “If Se­na­tor Har­ris wants to use a fortress around her­self, have at it.”</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Ms Sab­rina Singh, a spokesman for Ms Har­ris, wrote on Twit­ter: “In­ter­est­ing that @VPComDir Katie Miller mocks our want­ing a plex­i­glass bar­rier on the de­bate stage, when her own boss is sup­pos­edly in charge of the Covid-19 task force and should be ad­vo­cat­ing for this too.”</p>
    <p>Ms Miller her­self had Covid-19 in the spring.</p>
    <p>Also on Mon­day, Trump cam­paign spokesman Tim Mur­taugh said the Pres­i­dent in­tends to par­tic­i­pate in the next pres­i­den­tial de­bate, sched­uled for Oct 15 in Mi­ami.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump left a mil­i­tary hos­pi­tal on Mon­day af­ter three days of treat­ment, al­though mixed mes­sages from the White House have prompted un­cer­tainty about how ill he be­came.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den said on Mon­day that he was will­ing to par­tic­i­pate in next week’s sched­uled de­bate with Mr Trump as long as health ex­perts say it would be safe.</p>
    <p>The di­ag­no­sis has raised ques­tions about the safety of stag­ing the de­bates for the Nov 3 elec­tion. The first of three sched­uled de­bates took place last week, two days be­fore Mr Trump tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>“If the sci­en­tists say that it’s safe and the dis­tances are safe, then I think that’s fine. I’ll do what­ever the ex­perts say is the ap­pro­pri­ate thing to do,” Mr Bi­den, who tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19 over the week­end, told re­porters.</p>
    <p>WILL LIS­TEN TO EX­PERTS</p>
    <p>If the sci­en­tists say that it’s safe and the dis­tances are safe, then I think that’s fine. I’ll do what­ever the ex­perts say is the ap­pro­pri­ate thing to do.</p>
