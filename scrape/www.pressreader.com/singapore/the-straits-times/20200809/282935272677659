    <p>As a vol­un­teer ca­reer coach with a non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion, I have spo­ken to six Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents and lis­tened to their sto­ries in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>Four of them are un­em­ployed and look­ing for paid work at a time when jobs are scarce. The other two no longer find their jobs a good fit and want change.</p>
    <p>Theirs are the faces, hopes and fears that hide be­neath the de­press­ing job num­bers we read about week in, week out as the Covid-19 pan­demic drags on and its eco­nomic fall­out widens.</p>
    <p>Their strug­gles bring home to me the scale of the dis­lo­ca­tion tak­ing place, re­sult­ing in many job seek­ers hav­ing to make not just one, not just two, but three or more painful ad­just­ments at the same time, just for the chance to se­cure a re­place­ment job. These may in­clude dras­ti­cally re­vis­ing down their salary ex­pec­ta­tions, set­ting aside years of ex­pe­ri­ence so as to start learn­ing – some at age 40 or 50 – skills they never knew they needed, adapt­ing to a new work environmen­t, new work con­di­tions or a new work cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Each of these on its own is a sig­nif­i­cant tran­si­tion that in more nor­mal times, peo­ple would need time to ad­just to and set­tle into. Now, ad­just­ment time is a lux­ury only those with enough fi­nan­cial cush­ion can af­ford.</p>
    <p>Today’s job seek­ers and their fam­i­lies have to cope with change lay­ered upon change, even as un­cer­tainty hangs over what a post-Covid-19 world will look like. No one can be sure if the level of so­cial and eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity we used to take for granted will re­sume.</p>
    <p>That is a scary thought for sure, since con­sump­tion and eco­nomic growth have proven to be ef­fi­cient en­gines of job cre­ation in the past. But per­haps, in­stead of be­ing bogged down by grief over what we have lost and long­ing for a re­turn to the way things were, we need to seize this chance to re-imag­ine our so­ci­ety and econ­omy for the bet­ter.</p>
    <p>One change I con­sider long over­due is a greater fo­cus on the care econ­omy.</p>
    <p>A NEW CAR­ING ECO­NOM­ICS</p>
    <p>For too long, our so­ci­ety has nor­malised and priv­i­leged self-in­ter­est and the profit mo­tive as the best driv­ers for eco­nomic growth and devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>This model has en­abled Sin­ga­pore to grow very rich very fast, but it has also con­tributed to so­cial ills such as wealth and in­come in­equal­ity. Be­yond that, it has re­sulted in a com­pet­i­tive, stress­ful so­ci­ety which prizes ef­fi­ciency and mea­sur­able re­sults at the ex­pense of in­tan­gi­ble hu­man qual­i­ties, such as com­pas­sion.</p>
    <p>So­cial sci­en­tists like Ms Ta­nia Singer of the Max Planck In­sti­tute have cham­pi­oned other mod­els which they be­lieve re­flect more fully man’s na­ture and mo­ti­va­tions.</p>
    <p>In a piece pub­lished on the World Eco­nomic Forum blog in 2015, Ms Singer, a psy­chol­o­gist and so­cial neu­ro­sci­en­tist, ar­gued that the neo-clas­si­cal eco­nomic no­tion of man as essen­tially self­ish and act­ing ra­tio­nally only to max­imise his own util­ity “de­scribes only a part of our na­ture”.</p>
    <p>There is a need to “for­mu­late new mod­els of co­op­er­a­tion that... in­clude dif­fer­ent mo­ti­va­tional sys­tems able to guide dif­fer­ent types of hu­man be­hav­iour”. Such mod­els, she added, would be more re­al­is­tic and based on ex­pe­ri­ence, and they would “al­low us to cul­ti­vate greater pow­ers of com­pas­sion and build these into a new Car­ing Eco­nom­ics that fully re­flects what it is to be hu­man”.</p>
    <p>THE CARE ECON­OMY</p>
    <p>The care econ­omy refers to the sec­tor of eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties, both paid and un­paid, re­lated to the pro­vi­sion of so­cial and ma­te­rial care. It in­cludes care for chil­dren, the el­derly and the dis­abled, health care, ed­u­ca­tion and, as well, leisure and other per­sonal ser­vices, all of which con­trib­ute to nur­tur­ing and sup­port­ing present and fu­ture pop­u­la­tions. That’s the def­i­ni­tion used by the gov­ern­ment of Canada.</p>
    <p>My in­ter­est in the care econ­omy arose from my vol­un­teer work as a ca­reer coach, and the ex­pe­ri­ence of one of my clients who tried out for a job in Sin­ga­pore’s long-term care sec­tor. This sec­tor pro­vides care to se­niors and oth­ers who need help with their daily ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Af­ter at­tend­ing a ba­sic train­ing course or­gan­ised by the Agency for In­te­grated Care, my client was of­fered a job as she was able to re­late well to a se­nior in her care. But the monthly salary of around $2,000 was less than a third of what she used to earn do­ing re­gional sales for an equip­ment man­u­fac­turer. In the end, she turned down the job of­fer be­cause of her weak back, which meant she could not lift the se­niors in her care.</p>
    <p>It seems that long-term care is one sec­tor of the econ­omy where job va­can­cies go un­filled, even in a re­ces­sion like this one. A study com­mis­sioned by the Lien Foun­da­tion and pub­lished in 2018 makes clear why.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore needs to grow its pool of long-term care work­ers by at least 45 per cent be­tween 2017 and 2020, as more nurs­ing homes, day cen­tres for se­niors and home care ser­vices are de­vel­oped to cater to a rapidly age­ing pop­u­la­tion. But low pay, lim­ited prospects and con­tin­u­ing churn in the sec­tor may make it hard to meet this tar­get,” the Lien Foun­da­tion said about the study’s find­ings.</p>
    <p>The study com­pared the pay and perks of lo­cal long-term care work­ers with their coun­ter­parts in four other age­ing Asia-Pa­cific economies – Ja­pan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Aus­tralia. It found that lo­cal long-term care work­ers are the low­est paid. The me­dian monthly pay of sup­port care work­ers, such as nurs­ing aides and health­care as­sis­tants, who make up the bulk of the care work­force, ranged at that time from $1,300 to $1,350 – less than that of a data en­try clerk, shop as­sis­tant or lorry driver.</p>
    <p>The study also found that about 70 per cent of the di­rect care work­ers in the long-term care sec­tor were be­lieved to be for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>FROM 5 Cs TO 3 Cs</p>
    <p>These find­ings dis­turb me on sev­eral counts.</p>
    <p>First, they re­flect the low value we at­tach to care work. That in­cludes not just those who care for the el­derly but those who work in child­care and health­care, school teach­ers, coun­sel­lors, so­cial work­ers etc. This pan­demic has brought home our de­pen­dence on many es­sen­tial but lowly paid work­ers whose labour has di­rect im­pact on peo­ple’s wel­fare and daily needs.</p>
    <p>We now recog­nise the hero­ism of health­care work­ers but as the men­tal and emo­tional toll of un­cer­tainty and un­em­ploy­ment set in, coun­sel­lors and other men­tal health pro­fes­sion­als will be just as needed.</p>
    <p>School clo­sure opened par­ents’ eyes to just how hard teach­ers work to en­gage and ed­u­cate chil­dren and teens. Some par­ents went on so­cial me­dia to ex­press their heart­felt thanks, with one fa­ther say­ing teach­ers should each be paid a mil­lion dol­lars.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, the low sta­tus of care econ­omy jobs means Sin­ga­pore­ans will con­tinue to shun them when the coun­try needs them to do the op­po­site. With a rapidly age­ing pop­u­la­tion, Sin­ga­pore needs many more of its res­i­dents to join and re­main in the long-term care sec­tor, in­clud­ing those dis­placed due to the ef­fects of Covid-19 and whose jobs may never re­turn.</p>
    <p>For that to hap­pen, we must im­prove the pay, prospects and work con­di­tions of those in the care econ­omy, and ac­cord them the re­spect they so richly de­serve.</p>
    <p>As Sin­ga­pore cel­e­brates 55 years of in­de­pen­dence, let us com­mit our­selves to a new era of devel­op­ment founded on a fresh set of Cs – care, com­pas­sion and co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
