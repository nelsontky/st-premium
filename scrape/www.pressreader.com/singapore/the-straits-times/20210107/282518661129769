    <p>Ecuado­rian the­atre artiste Yulissa Cam­pos moved to Canada for univer­sity about eight years ago and later spent some time as a set­tle­ment worker, help­ing other new­com­ers such as im­mi­grants and refugees find their feet.</p>
    <p>Her story – and those of the peo­ple she en­coun­tered – are wo­ven into the warp and woof of I, Frida, her one-woman show about a young woman from Venezuela who mi­grates to Canada and tries to fit in.</p>
    <p>The pro­tag­o­nist, an ac­tivist for im­mi­grants’ rights, draws in­spi­ra­tion from two fig­ures – her mother and the late Mex­i­can painter Frida Kahlo. The comedic play, which in­cor­po­rates el­e­ments of magic re­al­ism, de­buted at the 2019 Saska­toon Fringe Fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>Cam­pos, 26, founded Ay, Caramba! The­atre, which is based in the Cana­dian city of Saska­toon and which seeks to di­ver­sify Cana­dian the­atre through His­panic sto­ries.</p>
    <p>She had wanted to per­form the play in Sin­ga­pore, but the Covid-19 pan­demic put paid to that. As a re­sult, the play was filmed at a lo­cal the­atre in Saska­toon and will be shown on­line at the M1 Sin­ga­pore Fringe Fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>Im­mi­gra­tion and dis­place­ment are com­mon is­sues, Cam­pos says, not­ing that the peo­ple who move are sim­ply seek­ing a bet­ter life.</p>
    <p>“I feel the out­side world thinks that in Canada, we open the bor­ders to ev­ery­body. But there’s a cer­tain stan­dard and qual­i­fi­ca­tions refugees need to have in or­der to be spon­sored. That is an­other thing I would like to share in my play – that noth­ing is granted for free,” she adds.</p>
    <p>“I think that’s the great­est mis­con­cep­tion, that refugees are just ben­e­fit­ing from the gov­ern­ment and not giv­ing any­thing in re­turn. But the re­al­ity is that they also have to pay their own share.”</p>
    <p>She hopes au­di­ences in Sin­ga­pore iden­tify with the play and that it sparks con­ver­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>“We have all been new in a dif­fer­ent home, in a dif­fer­ent city. You don’t need to be a new­comer to iden­tify with what it’s like to be dif­fer­ent in a new place,” she says.</p>
    <p>“The main mes­sage in the play is that we are all long­ing for home and find­ing who we are, no mat­ter where we are.”</p>
