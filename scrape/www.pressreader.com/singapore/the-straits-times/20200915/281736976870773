    <p>Re­trenched Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) staff who started re­ceiv­ing their pink slips from yes­ter­day have been told that they will con­tinue to re­ceive their salaries un­til Dec 15, The Straits Times has learnt.</p>
    <p>They will also re­tain their med­i­cal and other ben­e­fits un­til then.</p>
    <p>On top of this, each af­fected em­ployee will be paid in lieu of the no­tice pe­riod in their employment con­tract. This can be up to three months’ salary.</p>
    <p>Those who have been in ser­vice for two years or more will re­ceive one month of pay for ev­ery year of ser­vice, capped at 25 months.</p>
    <p>The re­trench­ment ex­er­cise – which af­fects about 2,400 staff – is be­ing con­ducted at the SIA Train­ing Cen­tre near Changi Air­port, for Sin­ga­pore-based staff.</p>
    <p>Staff are in­formed in ad­vance and given al­lo­cated dates for brief­ings.</p>
    <p>ST un­der­stands that on the first day, af­fected staff were driven to the venue in pre-booked taxis and driven back af­ter­wards.</p>
    <p>Upon ar­rival, they were ush­ered into a wait­ing room and given snacks and water.</p>
    <p>For cabin crew, about 30 were ush­ered into the au­di­to­rium at a time, where Mr Tan Pee Teck, SIA’s head of cabin crew, ad­dressed them.</p>
    <p>They were then di­vided into two groups, be­fore pro­ceed­ing for in­di­vid­ual ses­sions where they were given their re­trench­ment con­tracts and briefed on them.</p>
    <p>At the end of the brief­ing, they had to sur­ren­der their staff passes.</p>
    <p>SIA an­nounced last Thurs­day that it would slash around 20 per cent of its head­count – about 4,300 po­si­tions–amid the Covid-19 pan­demic that has paral­ysed the air travel sec­tor.</p>
    <p>About 2,400 staff in Sin­ga­pore and over­seas will be re­trenched, while the re­main­ing 1,900 roles will be ac­counted for through nat­u­ral at­tri­tion, a re­cruit­ment freeze and vol­un­tary-de­par­ture schemes.</p>
    <p>An SIA spokesman said yes­ter­day that the air­line has be­gun “the dif­fi­cult and painful process of re­leas­ing some of our staff mem­bers from their ser­vice”.</p>
    <p>He said: “We have worked closely with our unions to fi­nalise the ar­range­ments as soon as pos­si­ble for those who are af­fected, and we will aim to min­imise the stress and anx­i­ety for our peo­ple. The terms of the re­lease are in ac­cor­dance with our col­lec­tive agree­ments with our unions. SIA has also pro­vided addi</p>
    <p>tional as­sis­tance, where pos­si­ble and nec­es­sary.”</p>
    <p>The spokesman added that dur­ing the ex­er­cise, SIA de­ployed re­sources from across the com­pany to sup­port the af­fected staff.</p>
    <p>“The terms of the re­lease pack­age were ex­plained in­di­vid­u­ally to each af­fected staff. SIA also ar­ranged for</p>
    <p>on-site coun­sel­lors and med­i­cal staff, and pro­vided trans­port to and from their homes.”</p>
    <p>Union lead­ers were also present on-site to pro­vide sup­port to the af­fected staff.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ees who are cur­rently over­seas are be­ing in­formed per­son­ally via tele­phone calls or tele</p>
    <p>con­fer­enc­ing by com­pany rep­re­sen­ta­tives, said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>“We will sup­port any staff who are over­seas and need to re­turn to Sin­ga­pore to set­tle their af­fairs. Sin­ga­pore-based staff will also be given time to set­tle their af­fairs, and given as­sis­tance to re­turn to their home coun­tries if nec­es­sary,”</p>
    <p>the spokesman added.</p>
    <p>A por­tal list­ing avail­able job va­can­cies in external com­pa­nies has been cre­ated, with unions also pro­vid­ing sup­port where pos­si­ble.</p>
