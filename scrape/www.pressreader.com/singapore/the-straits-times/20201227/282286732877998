    <p>By Barack Obama Crown/ Hard­cover/ 751 pages/ $72.92/Ma­jor book­stores</p>
    <p>This first of what is to be a two-part au­to­bi­og­ra­phy has been an ex­pen­sive book for me.</p>
    <p>Rooted to my seat, of­ten fin­ish­ing 70 or 80 pages with­out stir­ring, I de­vel­oped a back­ache that has al­ready cost me a few hun­dred dol­lars in phys­io­ther­apy ses­sions.</p>
    <p>That said, at the end of what has in many ways been a dis­mal year, thanks to the Covid-19 pan­demic, the book was an up­lift­ing ex­pe­ri­ence and a re­minder of what is truly important at the end of the day – wife, chil­dren, the ex­tended fam­ily, friends, col­leagues and, of course, your na­tion. All fig­ure hand­somely in A Promised Land.</p>
    <p>Au­to­bi­ogra­phies can some­times be self-serv­ing at­tempts to present the in­di­vid­ual’s ver­sion of events or, on oc­ca­sion, set­tle scores.</p>
    <p>Mr Barack Obama is too cere­bral, too hon­est for that. He is a fly on the wall unto him­self, beam­ing in and out as par­tic­i­pant and ob­server on a daily ba­sis, his thoughts penned down in the quiet of his res­i­den­tial of­fice af­ter dinner with the fam­ily, which in­cludes his mother-in-law, for whose pres­ence in the house­hold he is grate­ful.</p>
    <p>He likes rap music and ad­mits to smok­ing in the White House and us­ing pro­fan­ity with his clos­est ad­vis­ers, some of whom he reg­u­larly plays bas­ket­ball with. Not for him silly for­mu­la­tions such as “smoked, but did not in­hale”.</p>
    <p>Un­like fel­low Democrats John Kennedy and Bill Clin­ton, who were cel­e­brated for their en­ter­tain­ing as much as their smarts, Mr Obama, at 47 the third-youngest to be voted into of­fice, seems to have been a far more re­strained giver of din­ners.</p>
    <p>In­stead, he prizes the fam­ily time he is de­ter­mined to have and he re­turns to talk of his wife and daugh­ters all the time.</p>
    <p>In­deed, the book is not just about how he sees the world, but how he sees the world with them in it. It is au­then­tic.</p>
    <p>Re­mem­ber the White House video of his meet­ing with the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew?</p>
    <p>Asked a ques­tion on Afghanista­n at the end of his open­ing re­marks with Mr Lee, Mr Obama’s re­sponse be­gins with “Michelle and I are al­ways con­scious...” about the sac­ri­fices of the men in uni­form.</p>
    <p>Mr Obama was the first AfricanAme­r­i­can pres­i­dent of the United States. On the day he took of­fice, many around the world, Sin­ga­pore in­cluded, asked them­selves: Could some­thing sim­i­lar not be pos­si­ble in their coun­tries too?</p>
    <p>Yet that achieve­ment, re­mark­able in it­self, owes some­thing to the prior Demo­cratic pres­i­dent, Mr Clin­ton, who was ad­mit­ted into the Black Hall of Fame. Mr Clin­ton’s colour-blind­ness i n some ways set the stage for Mr Obama’s rise. I would have loved to hear more about that from Mr Obama.</p>
    <p>The book’s nar­ra­tive ends in May 2011 with the death of Al-Qaeda’s Osama bin Laden, a lit­tle over two years into the pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>The big ques­tions about why Mr Obama backed off from his red lines over Syria and why he stood by and watched China’s Xi Jin­ping break his solemn prom­ise to not mil­i­tarise the South China Sea will need to wait for the next vol­ume.</p>
    <p>So, too, will a fuller ex­am­i­na­tion of how his per­sona and poli­cies may have con­trib­uted to the rise of Mr Don­ald Trump, who suc­ceeded him as pres­i­dent, and Trump­ism.</p>
    <p>Shades of this show up in patches, in­clud­ing Mr Obama’s con­trolled anger and in­dig­na­tion at Mr Trump, who spawned the zero-merit birther con­spir­acy.</p>
    <p>Mr Obama de­scribes Mr Trump “tepidly smil­ing” as he sits at a table hosted by The Washington Post at the annual White House Correspond­ents dinner, lis­ten­ing to the pres­i­dent roast him over the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>As lyri­cal as he is and rich as the thoughts and ideas he of­fers are, you get the feel­ing Mr Obama wants to say noth­ing to spoil the US’ ties with cur­rent or fu­ture world lead­ers. Per­haps he is just leav­ing the red meat for the next vol­ume.</p>
    <p>He does not mind re­veal­ing his dis­ap­point­ment with the an­o­dyne Hu Jin­tao or In­dia’s Rahul Gandhi, whose thoughts he found some­what “un­formed”. But the first has re­tired and no one gives the lat­ter’s po­lit­i­cal chances much prospects. This man still thinks pres­i­den­tial.</p>
    <p>On the con­fronta­tion with China, you have to be sat­is­fied with a de­light­ful story of how, at the Copen­hagen Sum­mit, he bearded then-Premier Wen Ji­abao, grouped in a small room up­stairs at the sum­mit venue with lead­ers of fel­low hold­outs In­dia, Brazil and South Africa, and got him to wave down his en­vi­ron­ment min­is­ter to en­dorse the Obama-crafted cli­mate change deal.</p>
    <p>Asians tend to see Mr Obama as the pres­i­dent un­der whom US in­flu­ence in Asia be­gan to wane, per­haps in­ter­minably, de­spite his talk of a “re­bal­ance” to­wards the re­gion.</p>
    <p>His own view on the sub­ject is nu­anced. He notes the Ge­orge W. Bush ad­min­is­tra­tion’s to­tal ab­sorp­tion with West Asia and the Wall Street fi­asco that led some other Asian lead­ers to ques­tion the US’ rel­e­vance to the re­gion and the in­creas­ing de­pen­dence of close US al­lies Ja­pan and South Korea on China’s mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Still, China had over­played its hand and this was fu­elling a de­sire for a more sus­tained US pres­ence.</p>
    <p>While see­ing these trends, Mr Obama seems to have set­tled for a slow de­cline in US in­flu­ence. Dur­ing his visit to Sin­ga­pore for the 2009 Asia-Pa­cific Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion sum­mit, his first to Asia as pres­i­dent, he sees a shift in the way Asean lead­ers saw them­selves.</p>
    <p>While they re­mained re­spect­ful of Amer­i­can power, “they no longer viewed the West as the cen­tre of the world, with their own coun­tries in­evitably cast as bit play­ers. In­stead, they con­sid­ered them­selves at least equal to their for­mer colonis­ers... As far as I was con­cerned, that was a good thing, an ex­ten­sion of Amer­ica’s faith in the dig­nity of all peo­ple”.</p>
    <p>Mr Obama is can­did about his own vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties, whether dis­cussing his early jour­nals (“a pretty ac­cu­rate chron­i­cle of all my short­com­ings”); the ini­tial shy­ness from his Hawai­ian and Indonesian up­bring­ing; or his “sen­si­tiv­ity to re­jec­tion or look­ing stupid. Maybe even a fun­da­men­tal lazi­ness”.</p>
    <p>A fun­da­men­tal de­cency in­hab­its this vol­ume. When he dis­cusses how the US ran bin Laden to the ground in a gar­ri­son town in Ab­bot­tabad, Pakistan, there is no trace of tri­umphal­ism, even as the Amer­i­can pub­lic in­stinc­tively seemed to seize on bin Laden’s death as a con­tem­po­rary V-day.</p>
    <p>He is more ex­u­ber­ant about the pas­sage of the Af­ford­able Care Act, his trade­mark health bill.</p>
    <p>Meet­ing the Navy Seals who ex­e­cuted the mis­sion, he does not wish to know who re­leased the fa­tal bul­let and or­ders that no pho­to­graphs of bin Laden in death ever see the light of day, partly with a re­al­ist’s re­luc­tance to al­low the man mar­tyr­dom.</p>
    <p>Mr Obama’s life is not merely about am­bi­tion or dogged­ness, but also rare beauty and the strength de­rived from strong re­la­tion­ships.</p>
    <p>It is his or­di­nar­i­ness that makes for com­pelling read­ing: the smok­ing habit he fi­nally man­ages to kick, t he emo­tions as he ob­serves his young daugh­ters ma­ture and bloom, the abil­ity to marvel at t he beauty of t he Mary­land coun­try­side from his Marine One he­li­copter at the tailend of a tir­ing over­seas jour­ney.</p>
    <p>Through it all is a con­vic­tion that the US is the great­est coun­try on earth, along with his pride in be­ing Amer­i­can.</p>
    <p>De­spite the op­ti­mism and the way he draws you into his life, I ended the book with a pro­found sense of fore­bod­ing for the US.</p>
    <p>If his ac­counts of US pol­i­tics are half­way ac­cu­rate, the na­tion is too di­vided, too prej­u­diced and too dys­func­tional to hold its great­ness.</p>
    <p>Of course, things could change as it waits for an­other turn of his­tory’s wheel.</p>
    <p>Come Jan 20, it will have not only its first woman vice-pres­i­dent, but also one that mixes African and Asian parent­age.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s vic­tory was no doubt powered by vast numbers of Amer­i­cans re­pu­di­at­ing Mr Trump, but Mr Obama’s ro­bust en­dorse­ment of his for­mer vice-pres­i­dent was important too. In some ways, the Obama pres­i­dency has not ended yet.</p>
    <p>Fam­ily keeps the best of us real and rooted and it is fit­ting that such a clear-eyed work of per­sonal and po­lit­i­cal his­tory should have been ded­i­cated to Michelle and their daugh­ters Malia and Sasha.</p>
    <p>When Michelle asks her hus­band what an early morn­ing phone call was about and he re­sponds that he had just been awarded the No­bel Peace Prize, she says, “That’s won­der­ful, honey”, and rolls over to con­tinue sleep­ing.</p>
    <p>It is too late to rec­om­mend this book as Christ­mas read­ing. But it would make a worth­while gift for Chi­nese New Year or Valen­tine’s Day. As the say­ing goes, give a pretty woman a book.</p>
    <p>If you like this, read: Be­com­ing by Michelle Obama (Crown, 2018, $49.76, ma­jor book­stores), for the for­mer US first lady’s side of things.</p>
