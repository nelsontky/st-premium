    <p>The ca­pac­ity for Fri­day prayers in some mosques will be in­creased to 250, as the Is­lamic gov­ern­ing body looks to grad­u­ally dou­ble the to­tal weekly spa­ces to 30,000. From next Wednesday, 19 mosques are set to in­crease their ca­pac­ity for daily con­gre­ga­tional prayers from 50 to 100, in line with na­tional guide­lines.</p>
    <p>The ca­pac­ity for Fri­day prayers in some mosques will be in­creased to 250, as the Is­lamic gov­ern­ing body looks to grad­u­ally dou­ble the weekly spa­ces to 30,000.</p>
    <p>An­nounc­ing this yes­ter­day, the Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore (Muis) also said se­niors who wish to visit the mosques can now do so in the light of the im­prov­ing Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion here.</p>
    <p>From next Wednesday, 19 mosques are set to in­crease their ca­pac­ity for daily con­gre­ga­tional prayers from 50 to 100, in line with na­tional guide­lines.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing dur­ing a vir­tual me­dia brief­ing yes­ter­day on the eas­ing of re­stric­tions on mosque ac­tiv­i­ties, Muis chief ex­ec­u­tive Esa Ma­sood said that since Fri­day prayers re­sumed in June af­ter the cir­cuit breaker, about 85,000 con­gre­gants have at­tended Fri­day prayers so far.</p>
    <p>“Cur­rently, Muis is able to of­fer 15,000 spa­ces each week for Fri­day prayers at our 64 mosques. We aim to ramp this up grad­u­ally to pro­vide 30,000 spa­ces each week. And this will al­low con­gre­gants to per­form their Fri­day prayers more reg­u­larly,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mus­lims have to re­serve their slots via an on­line book­ing sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Some mosques will run a pilot scheme to ac­com­mo­date up to 250 con­gre­gants, split across five zones, for each of the three Fri­day prayer ses­sions weekly. The pilot to fur­ther raise the Fri­day prayer ca­pac­ity is part of pro­gres­sive re­open­ing plans an­nounced by Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Esa said Muis will pro­vide more de­tails about the pilot af­ter it gets more clar­ity and ap­proval from the Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth. The mosques will be se­lected based on whether there is high de­mand for prayer slots and also if the venue has enough room to split con­gre­gants into five zones, he added.</p>
    <p>Muis’ se­nior direc­tor of mosque and com­mu­nity de­vel­op­ment Helmy Isa also an­nounced that, in line with the na­tional guide­lines for the sil­ver gen­er­a­tion, con­gre­gants aged 60 and above who are feeling well may re­turn to the mosques.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, when mosques re­opened in June, Muis had ad­vised se­niors to re­frain from vis­it­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Helmy, how­ever, urged those who are feeling un­well, vul­ner­a­ble in­di­vid­u­als and chil­dren aged below 12 against vis­it­ing the mosques and to per­form their prayers at home.</p>
    <p>Mufti Nazirudin Mohd Nasir noted that some chal­lenges will re­main as the pan­demic is not over.</p>
    <p>“Even with the in­crease in the num­ber of prayer spa­ces, we will not be able to per­form our Fri­day prayers... on a weekly ba­sis yet,” he said, adding that those who fail to se­cure a slot can skip the prayers and tune in to the ser­mons on­line.</p>
    <p>Mr Helmy said aLIVE classes, an Is­lamic ed­u­ca­tion pro­gramme, will grad­u­ally restart, with some mosques pi­lot­ing phys­i­cal classes from the mid­dle of this month. He added that mosques will or­gan­ise Maulid, or Prophet’s Birth­day cel­e­bra­tions, at the month end with on-site ac­tiv­i­ties and live streams.</p>
