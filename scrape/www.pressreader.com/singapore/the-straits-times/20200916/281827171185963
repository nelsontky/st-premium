    <p>PARIS • If Europe has a strat­egy to stop the spread of Covid-19, it’s keep­ing it well hid­den.</p>
    <p>France’s Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron has vowed not to go back to the dark days of na­tional lock­down, pre­fer­ring in­stead to “live” with the coro­n­avirus dis­ease, but his gov­ern­ment is strug­gling to halt a jump in cases.</p>
    <p>France re­ported more than 10,000 new cases in 24 hours over the weekend, a grim post­script to its de­ci­sion to cut the re­quired quar­an­tine for pos­i­tive cases in half to seven days.</p>
    <p>It is a sim­i­lar story in Spain, the coun­try with the most num­ber of cases in Europe and the first to cross the bar­rier of more than half a mil­lion in to­tal.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Pe­dro Sanchez has also ruled out a na­tional lock­down, but messy pub­lic health dis­agree­ments be­tween Madrid and re­gions such as Cat­alo­nia – and an ini­tially lax ap­proach to nightlife – have wors­ened a post-lock­down surge in cases.</p>
    <p>Tak­ing pop­u­la­tion into ac­count, the seven-day av­er­age rate of new cases in France and Spain is above that in the United States.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish cases are not too far be­hind, hitting their high­est level since May.</p>
    <p>Aus­tria is warn­ing that this is the start of a “sec­ond wave”.</p>
    <p>We’re not there yet in terms of deaths and hos­pi­tal ad­mis­sions, which re­main well be­low the virus’ April peak. For now, the bulk of new cases seem to be asymp­to­matic or mildly symp­to­matic young adults.</p>
    <p>Still, young peo­ple do not live in a vac­uum, and in­fec­tions are spread­ing to those who are older and more vul­ner­a­ble. The drive to get adults back into the of­fice and kids back into class­rooms, how­ever laud­able, is ac­cel­er­at­ing the virus’ spread.</p>
    <p>Es­ti­mates of the re­pro­duc­tion rate from Bank of Amer­ica sug­gest it’s above 1 in all big Euro­pean coun­tries bar Ger­many, mean­ing one in­fected per­son will, on av­er­age, spread it to more than one other per­son.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors warn of a rough win­ter ahead with­out a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>That is why fill­ing gaps in the testing, trac­ing and iso­la­tion of cases will be cru­cial in break­ing chains of trans­mis­sion over the next few months.</p>
    <p>Europe is testing far more than at the start of the pan­demic, with the share of tests com­ing back pos­i­tive at 10 per cent or be­low, but the al­lo­ca­tion of re­sources is still pretty woe­ful. The open­ing of the testing flood­gates to al­most any sus­pected case has over­whelmed lab­o­ra­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Tales of wait­ing for as long as eight days for a result in France, or the re­ported back­log of al­most 200,000 tests in the United King­dom, are a far­ci­cal coun­ter­point to the coun­tries’ head­line-grab­bing po­lit­i­cal tar­gets of one mil­lion or more tests per week. They’re a drag on pub­lic confidence and on the econ­omy, given the need to self-iso­late while wait­ing for the re­sults. No won­der peo­ple of­ten ig­nore stay-at-home rules.</p>
    <p>The trac­ing part of the equa­tion has also flopped. Dig­i­tal trac­ing apps de­signed to eas­ily track po­ten­tial trans­mis­sions from one pos­i­tive case have failed to at­tract a crit­i­cal mass of users in some coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The UK has yet to even launch its re­designed ver­sion. Hu­man trac­ers are strug­gling with a de­cline in con­tacts iden­ti­fied per pos­i­tive case – in France, it’s cur­rently around 2, while in Spain, the fig­ure is about 3.</p>
    <p>This is nee­dle-in-a-haystack ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>In France’s north­west Mayenne re­gion, where a flare-up of cases was suc­cess­fully curbed last month, mass testing was rolled out along­side a tar­get of de­liv­er­ing re­sults within be­tween 24 to 48 hours.</p>
    <p>Why not sim­ply aim for this turn­around time na­tion­ally? It might make those “no more lock­down” prom­ises a lit­tle eas­ier to keep.</p>
