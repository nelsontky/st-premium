    <p>A young man and his step­fa­ther de­cided to take mat­ters into their own hands af­ter a 26-year-old man re­peat­edly vis­ited their flat, and con­tin­ued do­ing so even af­ter the fam­ily lodged 56 po­lice re­ports against him.</p>
    <p>Ryan Xavier Tay Seet Choong, now 24, and his step­fa­ther,</p>
    <p>Lawrence Lim Peck Beng, were so frus­trated with Mr Shawn Ig­natius Ro­driguez that they as­saulted him on eight oc­ca­sions in 2015 and 2016.</p>
    <p>Things took a tragic turn on July 9, 2016, when Tay as­saulted Mr Ro­driguez, who was then serv­ing his na­tional ser­vice with the Repub­lic of Sin­ga­pore Air Force, and Mr Ro­driguez later died of trau­matic as­phyxia with a head in­jury.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, af­ter a trial, Dis­trict Judge Tan Jen Tse found Tay guilty of vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing griev­ous hurt to Mr Ro­driguez. Lim, now 58, was found guilty of abet­ting his step­son in com­mit­ting the of­fence.</p>
    <p>Be­fore he died, Mr Ro­driguez at­tended 10 coun­selling ses­sions at the Cen­tre for Psy­chother­apy and Dr Nisha Rani found that he was pos­si­bly suf­fer­ing from ero­to­ma­nia – an ob­ses­sion and a be­lief that some­body loves the af­flicted per­son. He was later re­ferred to the In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health and Dr Su­san Zachariah, a psy­chi­a­trist, as­sessed him on July 7, 2016.</p>
    <p>Dr Zachariah found Mr Ro­driguez could be suf­fer­ing from Asperger’s syn­drome and ob­ses­sive-com­pul­sive dis­or­der. But Tay as­saulted him two days later. He died be­fore re­ceiv­ing his de­fin­i­tive di­ag­no­sis.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tors Wong Kok Weng, Ja­son Chua and Chong Kee En had ear­lier stated in their sub­mis­sions that Mr Ro­driguez and Tay knew each other in 2006 when they were altar boys at the Church of Our Lady Star of the Sea in Yishun.</p>
    <p>Tay, how­ever, left eight years later as he felt that Mr Ro­driguez was “fix­ated” with him.</p>
    <p>Mr Ro­driguez then tried to con­tact Tay by making fre­quent phone calls, and started loi­ter­ing around the void deck of the lat­ter’s home at Yishun Street 22.</p>
    <p>The prose­cu­tors had said that in Jan­uary 2016, Tay’s mother, Madam Irene Ng, filed a mag­is­trate’s com­plaint against Mr Ro­driguez that led to me­di­a­tion pro­ceed­ings in the State Courts.</p>
    <p>A me­di­a­tion judge then told him to stop vis­it­ing Tay. De­spite this, Mr Ro­driguez con­tin­ued vis­it­ing the Yishun flat. Mr Ro­driguez vis­ited the block on July 9 that year.</p>
    <p>The prose­cu­tors said: “At about 7.40pm, the de­ceased re­turned. Lawrence opened the door and shouted at the de­ceased for about</p>
    <p>Num­ber of coun­selling ses­sions the vic­tim had at­tended at the Cen­tre for Psy­chother­apy be­fore he died. Dr Nisha Rani found that he was pos­si­bly suf­fer­ing from ero­to­ma­nia – an ob­ses­sion and a be­lief that some­body loves the af­flicted per­son. five min­utes and opened the gate in­tend­ing to phys­i­cally en­gage him.</p>
    <p>“At this junc­ture, Ryan came out of the unit and the de­ceased started to run away. Ryan chased the de­ceased down the cor­ri­dor and up the stair­case at lift land­ing B.”</p>
    <p>A scuf­fle broke out be­tween the two men and Tay later used his right knee to press against Mr Ro­driguez’s back even though the lat­ter did not strug­gle.</p>
    <p>Lim then sat on Mr Ro­driguez’s but­tocks and per­formed a leg lock by cross­ing the lat­ter’s lower legs.</p>
    <p>The court heard that a few neigh­bours later brought items in­clud­ing a rope and raf­fia string.</p>
    <p>One of them, Mr Lim Hock Piou, tied Mr Ro­driguez’s an­kles while Lim held on to Mr Ro­driguez legs.</p>
    <p>Tay, mean­while, con­tin­ued to press his knee against his back.</p>
    <p>The po­lice ar­rived at the scene be­fore Mr Lim Hock Piou could com­plete ty­ing Mr Ro­driguez’s legs.</p>
    <p>A Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force para­medic pro­nounced him dead at around 8.30pm. Tay and Lim will be sen­tenced on Oct 5.</p>
