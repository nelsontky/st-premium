    <p>Last month, Face­book re­leased a state­ment ti­tled What The So­cial Dilemma Gets Wrong. Here is an ex­cerpt. For the full state­ment, go to bit.ly/399ZpHk.</p>
    <p>“We should have con­ver­sa­tions about the im­pact of so­cial me­dia on our lives. But The So­cial Dilemma buries the sub­stance in sen­sa­tion­al­ism. Rather than of­fer a nu­anced look at tech­nol­ogy, it gives a dis­torted view of how so­cial me­dia plat­forms work to cre­ate a con­ve­nient scape­goat for what are dif­fi­cult and com­plex so­ci­etal prob­lems.</p>
    <p>The film’s cre­ators do not in­clude in­sights from those cur­rently work­ing at the com­pa­nies or any ex­perts that take a dif­fer­ent view to the nar­ra­tive put for­ward by the film.</p>
    <p>They also do not ac­knowl­edge – crit­i­cally or oth­er­wise – the ef­forts al­ready taken by com­pa­nies to ad­dress many of the is­sues they raise. In­stead, they rely on com­men­tary from those who haven’t been on the in­side for many years.</p>
    <p>Here are the core points the film gets wrong: 1. Face­book builds its prod­ucts to cre­ate value, not to be ad­dic­tive. Our News Feed prod­uct teams are not in­cen­tivised to build fea­tures that in­crease time spent on our prod­ucts. In­stead we want to make sure we of­fer value to peo­ple, not just drive us­age.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, in 2018, we changed our rank­ing for</p>
    <p>News Feed to pri­ori­tise mean­ing­ful so­cial interactio­ns and de­pri­ori­tise things like vi­ral videos. The change led to a de­crease of 50 mil­lion hours a day worth of time spent on Face­book. That isn’t the kind of thing you do if you are sim­ply try­ing to drive peo­ple to use your ser­vices more.</p>
    <p>We col­lab­o­rate with lead­ing men­tal health ex­perts, or­gan­i­sa­tions and aca­demics, and have our re­search teams de­voted to un­der­stand­ing the im­pact that so­cial me­dia may have on peo­ple’s well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>We want peo­ple to con­trol how they use our prod­ucts, which is why we pro­vide time man­age­ment tools like an ac­tiv­ity dash­board, a daily re­minder and ways to limit no­ti­fi­ca­tions. We have al­ready started ded­i­cat­ing prod­uct teams to fo­cus on other ar­eas like lone­li­ness, racial jus­tice, men­tor­ship... We will con­tinue in­no­vat­ing and com­ing up with new tools to help peo­ple stay safe.</p>
    <p>2. You are not the prod­uct. Face­book is funded by ad­ver­tis­ing so that it re­mains free for peo­ple. Face­book is an ad­ver­tise­ments-sup­ported plat­form, which means that sell­ing ads al­lows us to of­fer ev­ery­one else the abil­ity to con­nect for free. This model al­lows small busi­nesses and en­trepreneur­s to grow and com­pete with big­ger brands by more eas­ily find­ing new cus­tomers.”</p>
