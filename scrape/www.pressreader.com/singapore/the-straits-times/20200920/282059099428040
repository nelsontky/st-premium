    <p>NEW YORK • Tiger Woods de­parted Winged Foot dis­ap­pointed and frus­trated af­ter miss­ing the US Open cut, but is al­ready look­ing for­ward to de­fend­ing his Masters ti­tle in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>The 15-time Ma­jor win­ner fired a seven-over 77 on Fri­day at the famed Ma­maro­neck, New York, lay­out to fin­ish on 10-over 150, four strokes be­yond the cut line.</p>
    <p>“It’s frus­trat­ing that I’m not go­ing to be here for the week­end,” he said. “It feels like the way the golf course is chang­ing, any­body who makes the cut has the op­por­tu­nity to win this cham­pi­onship. I didn’t get my­self that op­por­tu­nity.”</p>
    <p>What is next for the 44-year-old is some rest and recovery time.</p>
    <p>Shots adrift of the cut line for Tiger Woods af­ter card­ing a seven-over 77 for a 150 to­tal on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“Well, prob­a­bly I’m not go­ing to be swing­ing a club for a lit­tle bit,” he said. “Take a lit­tle break. And then re­fo­cus and get back af­ter it.”</p>
    <p>The next time he tees off in a Ma­jor will be in Novem­ber when he has his long-de­layed op­por­tu­nity to de­fend his Masters ti­tle. He cap­tured the green jacket in April last year but, be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, has to wait un­til Nov 12-15 to re­turn to Au­gusta Na­tional.</p>
    <p>“There’s still one more Ma­jor to go, and my ti­tle de­fence at Sher­wood,” he said of the Zozo Cham­pi­onship, which he won in Ja­pan last Oc­to­ber but will next take place at Sher­wood Coun­try Club in Cal­i­for­nia next month.</p>
    <p>“We have a cou­ple (of) big, big things ahead of us.”</p>
    <p>US Open de­fend­ing cham­pion Gary Wood­land, who shot a sec­ond-round 74 for a 148 to­tal, was among a host of Ma­jor win­ners who joined Woods in miss­ing the cut. PGA Cham­pi­onship win­ner Collin Morikawa (71, 147), Justin Rose (77, 150), Hen­rik Sten­son (77, 151), Phil Mick­el­son (74, 153), Jor­dan Spi­eth (81, 154) and Ser­gio Gar­cia (81, 155) all ex­ited pre­ma­turely.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can Pa­trick Reed, how­ever, rel­ished the chal­leng­ing con­di­tions, over­com­ing swirling winds, thick rough and speedy greens to jump to the top of the leader­board.</p>
    <p>The 2018 Masters cham­pion fired a 70 for a four-un­der 136 to­tal, one stroke ahead of com­pa­triot Bryson DeCham­beau. “I love the grind,” he said, af­ter hit­ting just five fair­ways. “I love when it’s hard, when you have to be cre­ative on all dif­fer­ent golf shots.”</p>
    <p>The 30-year-old is con­fi­dent he can tidy up his game as he guns for his sec­ond Ma­jor ti­tle. “I feel ready to go out and put my­self in po­si­tion hope­fully to­mor­row to have a chance late on Sun­day,” he said.</p>
    <p>“But I think the big­gest thing is, I feel like the game is where it needs to be. I feel good. I just need to tighten a few things up here or there, but the short game is sharp, and when I play around a place like this, that’s what you need.”</p>
