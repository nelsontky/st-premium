    <p>From to­day, the min­i­mum le­gal age to buy to­bacco in Sin­ga­pore will be raised from 20 to 21. This is part of the Gov­ern­ment’s re­cent ef­fort to tackle the prob­lem of smok­ing, to­gether with mea­sures such as plain pack­ag­ing, point-of-sale dis­play bans and the Or­chard Road smok­ing ban.</p>
    <p>The con­certed ef­fort in to­bacco con­trol has seen smok­ing rates in Sin­ga­pore fall steadily from 14.3 per cent in 2010 to 10.6 per cent in 2019. While this is a laud­able achieve­ment, the coun­try can­not af­ford to rest on its lau­rels and more needs to be done.</p>
    <p>The youth con­tinue to pick up smok­ing, with around 16 per cent of males and 11 per cent of fe­males who started smok­ing be­fore the age of 21.</p>
    <p>Among cur­rent smok­ers, one in two will die from a to­bacco-re­lated dis­ease. In Sin­ga­pore alone, over 300 non-smok­ers die each year be­cause of ex­po­sure to se­cond-hand smoke.</p>
    <p>To­bacco con­trol poli­cies gen­er­ally tar­get one or more of the fol­low­ing three groups: would-be smok­ers, mostly youth; cur­rent smok­ers; and peo­ple af­fected by se­cond-hand smoke. A range of mea­sures is needed to dis­cour­age smok­ing ini­ti­a­tion, mo­ti­vate and sup­port quit­ting, and pro­tect peo­ple from se­cond-hand smoke.</p>
    <p>The min­i­mum le­gal age will stop in­creas­ing year on year from this year and sta­bilise at the age of 21. This ap­pears to be the cul­mi­na­tion of the se­ries of to­bacco con­trol mea­sures in­tro­duced in the past four years.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion is, is there any­thing else Sin­ga­pore can do to ad­dress the prob­lem of to­bacco?</p>
    <p>We think there are.</p>
    <p>RAISE MIN­I­MUM AGE TO 25</p>
    <p>First, there is no rea­son why Sin­ga­pore should stop the year-on-year in­crease of the min­i­mum le­gal age at 21. In fact, we be­lieve this should con­tinue un­til 2025, to al­low the min­i­mum le­gal age to in­crease yearly un­til 25.</p>
    <p>Vir­tu­ally ev­ery­one who smokes started the first cig­a­rette be­fore the age of 25, which is when the de­vel­op­ing brain is most vul­ner­a­ble to ad­dic­tions. Re­search has shown that peo­ple are more likely to develop a smok­ing habit if they start be­fore this age.</p>
    <p>Rais­ing the min­i­mum le­gal age to 25 thus im­poses a pow­er­ful reg­u­la­tory mea­sure against any bi­o­log­i­cal im­pulse to con­tinue smok­ing when ini­ti­ated.</p>
    <p>This is not dif­fi­cult to im­ple­ment since re­tail­ers are al­ready fa­mil­iar with the need to check IDs prior to to­bacco sales. Oper­a­tionally, it is also much eas­ier to con­tinue the year-on-year in­crease with­out any break. This way, it is clear the reg­u­la­tion af­fects ev­ery­one born af­ter 2000.</p>
    <p>RAISE TO­BACCO TAXES</p>
    <p>Se­cond, Sin­ga­pore can con­tinue to in­crease to­bacco taxes.</p>
    <p>In de­vel­oped coun­tries such as Aus­tralia and the United King­dom, to­bacco taxes ac­count for around 80 per cent of the to­tal price, whereas this is only around 67 per cent in Sin­ga­pore, which is be­low the min­i­mum tax rate of 70 per cent rec­om­mended by the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) . To­bacco con­sump­tion gen­er­ally falls when tax in­creases go beyond in­cre­ments in salary.</p>
    <p>Young peo­ple, who have less dis­pos­able in­come, are more sen­si­tive to price in­creases. High prices for to­bacco prod­ucts, as a re­sult of high taxes, are es­pe­cially ef­fec­tive in de­ter­ring smok­ing among young peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The WHO calls to­bacco taxes a “best buy” against chronic dis­eases – a pol­icy mea­sure that is cost-ef­fec­tive to en­act at the pop­u­la­tion level.</p>
    <p>In fact, taxes on to­bacco prod­ucts are con­sid­ered a “win-win-win” pol­icy as they de­crease con­sump­tion, re­duce fu­ture health­care ex­pen­di­ture as a re­sult of to­bacco-re­lated mor­bid­ity and mor­tal­ity, and gen­er­ate tax rev­enue that can be used to sub­sidise smok­ing ces­sa­tion med­i­ca­tions or pub­lic ed­u­ca­tion cam­paigns.</p>
    <p>BAN FLAVOURS IN TO­BACCO</p>
    <p>Third, Sin­ga­pore should ban to­bacco flavours.</p>
    <p>Half of the cig­a­rettes sold here con­tain added flavours such as men­thol, mint or fruit. To­bacco com­pa­nies add these flavours into cig­a­rettes to make cig­a­rettes more ap­peal­ing to young peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Men­thol, the most com­mon flavour, masks the harsh­ness for first-time smok­ers and makes cig­a­rettes more ad­dic­tive. Tak­ing flavoured cig­a­rettes off the mar­ket is likely to have a huge im­pact on de­ter­ring young peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore from ini­ti­at­ing smok­ing.</p>
    <p>This will cer­tainly af­fect cur­rent smok­ers as well, and some may even be com­pelled to quit when they are faced with the unadul­ter­ated truth about the smell of non-flavoured to­bacco. For these peo­ple, they should be aptly pro­vided with quit sup­port.</p>
    <p>MORE QUIT PRO­GRAMMES</p>
    <p>This leads us to the fourth rec­om­men­da­tion, that Sin­ga­pore should do more to sup­port smok­ers in their quit at­tempts.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age suc­cess rate for a cold tur­key quit at­tempt is only around 5 per cent. The use of ev­i­dence-based in­ter­ven­tions such as nico­tine re­place­ment ther­apy and coun­selling can in­crease the suc­cess rate to 30 per cent, or six times higher.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment could sub­sidise such ev­i­dence-based in­ter­ven­tions, and col­lab­o­rate with em­ploy­ers to in­stall smok­ing ces­sa­tion pro­grammes at the work­place as an in­te­gral com­po­nent of the To­tal Work­place Safety and Health pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>By mak­ing smok­ing ces­sa­tion aids more af­ford­able and ac­ces­si­ble, it be­comes eas­ier for cur­rent smok­ers to em­bark on a quit-smok­ing jour­ney.</p>
    <p>CURB SE­COND-HAND SMOKE</p>
    <p>Fifth, Sin­ga­pore needs to do more to pro­tect peo­ple from se­cond-hand smoke.</p>
    <p>Se­cond-hand smoke con­tains over 60 known car­cino­gens and can cause heart dis­ease, lung cancer and “cot death” or sud­den un­ex­plained in­fant death, among many other se­ri­ous dis­eases. There is no safe level of ex­po­sure to se­cond-hand smoke.</p>
    <p>Al­though smok­ing is banned in most pub­lic spa­ces, peo­ple are still ex­posed to se­cond-hand smoke at places such as cof­fee shops, bus stops and even en­trances to shop­ping malls. In fact, it is not un­com­mon for one to have to brave the fog of cig­a­rette smoke when nav­i­gat­ing crowded out­door spa­ces.</p>
    <p>En­forc­ing the smok­ing ban should be just as vi­tal as how safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors en­sure com­pli­ance with mask wear­ing and so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules in com­bat­ing Covid-19. Af­ter all, it is even more in­ex­cus­able and vex­ing for any­one to fall ill as a re­sult of un­con­trol­lable ex­po­sure to se­cond-hand smoke.</p>
    <p>It is also per­haps time to con­sider ex­tend­ing the smoke-free zon­ing in Or­chard</p>
    <p>Road to even more places, in­clud­ing the Cen­tral Busi­ness Dis­trict and the heart­land neigh­bour­hoods.</p>
    <p>Des­ig­nated smok­ing ar­eas will still al­low smok­ers to have the nec­es­sary out­let to sat­isfy their nico­tine fix, but if the ar­eas are lo­cated well, this rad­i­cally re­duces any in­ad­ver­tent ex­po­sure to se­cond-hand smoke.</p>
    <p>To­bacco con­trol is a com­plex is­sue. While sev­eral coun­tries, such as Ire­land, Fin­land, Canada and New Zealand, have set tar­gets to be­come to­bacco-free na­tions by a cer­tain year, none of them will achieve this overnight. In­stead, they will reach this goal grad­u­ally by adopt­ing sen­si­ble poli­cies that are proven to work.</p>
    <p>What is clear is that there is no sin­gle mea­sure that can act as a magic bul­let to pro­tect and main­tain the health of all three groups of peo­ple. We will al­ways need a com­pre­hen­sive suite of mea­sures work­ing in tan­dem to tackle the to­bacco epi­demic.</p>
