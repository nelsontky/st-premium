    <p>When a power fault first struck the North-South and East-West Lines on Oct 14, SMRT’s first fo­cus was to avoid hav­ing to evac­u­ate pas­sen­gers on stalled trains, said its chief ex­ec­u­tive Neo Kian Hong.</p>
    <p>That was why the op­er­a­tor de­cided to draw power from an al­ter­na­tive sub­sta­tion in Buona Vista, in a bid to re­store ser­vice along the af­fected sta­tions more quickly.</p>
    <p>But two em­ploy­ees – a su­per­vi­sor and a staff mem­ber – mis­read equip­ment at the sub­sta­tion and thought the power fault in Tuas had been iso­lated when that was not the case.</p>
    <p>The fail­ure to iso­late the fault be­fore drawing power caused a volt­age dip at the sub­sta­tion, which pow­ers the Cir­cle Line. This caused a power trip and af­fected ser­vice on the Cir­cle Line.</p>
    <p>The two em­ploy­ees have been sus­pended and will have to un­dergo re­train­ing and re-cer­ti­fi­ca­tion be­fore they can re­sume their du­ties, said Mr Neo at a me­dia brief­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He added that SMRT took “a lot of safety pre­cau­tions” when it de­cided it had to evac­u­ate pas­sen­gers from the stalled trains, to main­tain the safety and well-be­ing of com­muters on board.</p>
    <p>These in­cluded sus­pend­ing de­train­ment for one of the trains near Bukit Ba­tok at 8.44pm due to rain and light­ning risk. The train, which was the last to be cleared of pas­sen­gers, was emp­tied only at 9.43pm, two hours and 45 min­utes af­ter the fault be­gan.</p>
    <p>The Land Trans­port Author­ity (LTA) yes­ter­day said pas­sen­gers had to be de­trained from 15 stalled trains – three on the Cir­cle Line and 12 on the North-South and EastWest Lines. De­train­ment was com­pleted within 20 min­utes on the Cir­cle Line, but took more than an hour on the North-South and EastWest Lines.</p>
    <p>In a re­port re­leased yes­ter­day, LTA said it had re­ceived feed­back that more up­dates should be pro­vided on the sit­u­a­tion lead­ing up to the de­train­ment, “for bet­ter aware­ness and pre­pared­ness”.</p>
    <p>SMRT will con­tinue to im­prove its com­mu­ni­ca­tions dur­ing dis­rup­tions and ar­range for its staff to pro­vide com­muters in stalled trains with more up­dates, LTA said.</p>
    <p>It noted that reg­u­lar bus ser­vices ply­ing the af­fected sta­tions were made free im­me­di­ately and 120 shut­tle buses were mo­bilised to ferry com­muters. “There were pe­ri­ods of crowd con­ges­tion at the bus points of the af­fected sta­tions ini­tially and later at the sta­tions where trains turned around,” it said.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions con­ducted later that night found that power ca­bles</p>
    <p>lo­cated around 500m from Tuas Link sta­tion along the Tuas West Ex­ten­sion were burned through.</p>
    <p>There were short cir­cuits be­tween three ca­bles on the up­per layer of the two-layer power cable network, which led to a high fault cur­rent burn­ing through the ca­bles.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, a trip coil – a com­po­nent of a nearby cir­cuit breaker which should have kicked in to iso­late the fault – was found to have melted. This caused the cir­cuit breaker to fail.</p>
    <p>LTA said re­pair works on the faulty power ca­bles be­tween Tuas Link and Tuas West Road sta­tions were com­pleted over two nights, on Oct 16 and 17. The faulty trip coil was re­placed on the night of the in­ci­dent it­self.</p>
    <p>SMRT checked all trip coils along the Tuas West Ex­ten­sion as a pre­cau­tion and found two other trip coils that “ex­hib­ited in­con­sis­tent per­for­mance that could re­sult in a sim­i­lar fail­ure”.</p>
    <p>French firm Al­stom, which sup­plied the power sys­tem, is con­duct­ing foren­sic in­ves­ti­ga­tions on the faulty trip coils, the LTA said.</p>
    <p>The re­port also re­vealed that the Tuas West Ex­ten­sion had ex­pe­ri­enced sim­i­lar cable faults since it be­gan op­er­a­tions in May 2017.</p>
    <p>Two cable faults oc­curred in 2018 and two more this year, in Jan­uary and June. The faults all oc­curred at the up­per layer of the ca­bles, along dif­fer­ent stretches of the MRT ex­ten­sion line. Train ser­vices were not af­fected be­cause the cir­cuit break­ers kicked in to iso­late the faulty ca­bles, LTA said.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the fault in June, Al­stom had agreed to re­place all up­per-layer power ca­bles with ca­bles that have tougher in­su­la­tion. The re­place­ment was sched­uled to start this month. Al­stom had also agreed to a 20-year war­ranty ex­ten­sion for the lower-layer ca­bles.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the Oct 14 dis­rup­tion, Al­stom has also agreed to re­place all the lower-layer ca­bles. In all, it will re­place about 150km of ca­bles along the Tuas West Ex­ten­sion by the end of next year, at its own cost.</p>
