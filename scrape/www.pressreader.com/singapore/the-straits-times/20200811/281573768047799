    <p>Golf’s ris­ing young star Collin Morikawa (right) showed fans on Sun­day that tim­ing is an art form in sport, as the Asian Amer­i­can picked the per­fect mo­ment to land two per­fect shots en route to win­ning the PGA Cham­pi­onship ti­tle. It was the 23-year-old’s maiden Ma­jor since turn­ing pro­fes­sional last year.</p>
    <p>SAN FRAN­CISCO • In a sports year up­ended by the coro­n­avirus cri­sis, cham­pi­onship mo­ments have been long awaited, and Collin Morikawa cre­ated an ex­traor­di­nary one on Sun­day at the 102nd PGA Cham­pi­onship at TPC Hard­ing Park.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old na­tive Cal­i­for­nian of half Ja­panese de­scent etched his name on the Wana­maker Tro­phy with a fi­nal-round six-un­der 64 for a 13-un­der 267 to­tal in only his sec­ond ap­pear­ance at a Ma­jor cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>He be­came the third-youngest win­ner of the PGA Cham­pi­onship since it be­came a stroke­play event in 1958 – only Jack Nick­laus in 1963 and Rory McIl­roy in 2012 were younger when they won it.</p>
    <p>“I’m so ex­cited, but it feels like this is where I’m sup­posed to be,” said Morikawa, who only turned pro­fes­sional just last year af­ter grad­u­at­ing from the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, Berke­ley.</p>
    <p>His play down the stretch on Sun­day, how­ever, sug­gested a ma­tu­rity that can­not be mea­sured in years.</p>
    <p>This PGA Cham­pi­onship will be re­mem­bered for many things – its sta­tus as the first Ma­jor to be played af­ter the Covid-19 pan­demic shut down the PGA Tour for three months, the ab­sence of fans and the quiet on the course.</p>
    <p>But from a purely golf per­spec­tive, it will be re­mem­bered as the place where Morikawa hit the shot of dreams – driv­ing his ball from the tee to seven feet from the hole at the 294-yard, par-four 16th.</p>
    <p>Then he con­verted an ea­gle putt to break a tie with Paul Casey. One could only imag­ine how a Sun­day gallery would have re­acted.</p>
    <p>Prac­tis­ing on the range in case of a play-off, the English­man could only mar­vel.</p>
    <p>“What a shot he hit on 16,” said Casey, who shot a 66 to end joint sec­ond on 269 along­side overnight leader Dustin John­son, who carded a 68. “Just awe­some golf. There’s noth­ing you can do ex­cept tip your cap. Collin took on the chal­lenge. That’s what cham­pi­ons do.”</p>
    <p>John­son, who fell to 0-4 at Ma­jors where he held at least a share of the lead af­ter 54 holes and whose sole Ma­jor came at the 2016 US Open, de­clined to talk to the me­dia.</p>
    <p>Morikawa, who parred Nos. 17 and 18 to close the deal, later re­counted the con­ver­sa­tion at the 16th tee box, where his cad­die, J.J. Jako­vac, asked what club he wanted. “I said, ‘Let’s hit driver.’ This is per­fect. That’s when you have to cap­i­talise,” he added.</p>
    <p>He also re­mem­bered a sim­i­lar drive he hit at Muir­field Vil­lage en route to his victory at the Tour’s Work­day Char­ity Open last month. “It fit my eye,” he said. Un­leash­ing his driver on an ag­gres­sive line, his bold play cut slightly towards the tar­get, cleared a dan­ger­ous pack of cy­press trees guard­ing the green and landed softly, rolling to a stop seven feet away. The shot in­stantly had the sheen of leg­end.</p>
    <p>“We were hop­ing for a good bounce, and we got one,” he said.</p>
    <p>Morikawa, who started the fi­nal round two shots be­hind fel­low Amer­i­can John­son, now has three wins in 27 starts over­all in his brief time on the PGA Tour and his run of 22 straight made cuts since turn­ing pro is sec­ond only to 15-time Ma­jor win­ner Tiger Woods (25).</p>
    <p>“It’s amaz­ing,” Morikawa said af­ter re­ceiv­ing the Wana­maker Tro­phy on the 18th green. “To close it out in San Fran­cisco, which is pretty much my sec­ond home, where I spent the last four years (in col­lege), is pretty spe­cial.”</p>
    <p>Part of Hard­ing Park’s ap­peal has been its il­lus­tri­ous ros­ter of cham­pi­ons. Woods, who fin­ished tied for 37th over the week­end at one-un­der for the tour­na­ment af­ter a solid round of 67, won the 2005 WGCAmer­i­can Ex­press Cham­pi­onship here, while four-time Ma­jor win­ner Rory McIl­roy won the WGC-Match­play in 2015.</p>
    <p>It has also pro­duced ti­tles for the Hall of Famers By­ron Nel­son, Gary Player and Ken Ven­turi. Add the new world No. 5 to the list.</p>
    <p>HARD TO BE­LIEVE I’m on cloud nine right now. It’s hard to think about what this cham­pi­onship means. Ob­vi­ously it’s a Ma­jor, and this is what guys go for, es­pe­cially at the end of their ca­reer. And we’re just start­ing. ’’ COLLIN MORIKAWA, 23-year-old Ja­panese-Amer­i­can, on be­ing the third-youngest PGA Cham­pi­onship win­ner.</p>
    <p>SAN FRAN­CISCO • The per­for­mance of some of the PGA Tour’s bright­est young tal­ents at the PGA Cham­pi­onship shows the fu­ture of golf is in good hands, as sea­soned pros and vet­er­ans heaped praise on maiden win­ner 23-year-old Collin Morikawa on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can, who turned pro­fes­sional last year and was ap­pear­ing in just his sec­ond Ma­jor, shot a six-un­der 64 for a to­tal of 13-un­der 267 to top the leader­board at TPC</p>
    <p>Great at­ti­tude. Stayed very calm and stayed in the present. Wasn’t enough. The glo­ri­ous shots Collin hit like on 16 to make ea­gle, you have to tip your cap.</p>
    <p>Hard­ing Park in Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>While com­pa­triot and former world No. 1 Dustin John­son, and Eng­land’s Paul Casey, who turned pro 20 years ago, ran Morikawa clos­est, the chas­ing pack fea­tured the likes of Amer­i­cans Matthew Wolff, 21, Scot­tie Sch­ef­fler, 24, and Bryson DeCham­beau, 26, who all fin­ished three stokes back in joint­fourth.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can Cameron Champ, 25, was also in con­tention on Sun­day be­fore he stum­bled with a dou­ble bo­gey on the ninth hole, end­ing tied for 10th.</p>
    <p>Wolff, Morikawa and Champ all won their first Tour event be­fore their 10th pro start, leav­ing Brooks Koepka im­pressed with how eas­ily the younger play­ers have made the tran­si­tion from col­lege golf to the pro ranks.</p>
    <p>“You see these guys com­ing out of col­lege now, they are ready to win,” said the 30-year-old former world No. 1 and four-time Ma­jor cham­pion, who had been going for a third straight PGA Cham­pi­onship win.</p>
    <p>“I think of that group, Collin Morikawa, Matt Wolff, (22-yearold Nor­we­gian) Vik­tor Hov­land, it’s im­pres­sive what they do. They come out of col­lege and they’re ready to play out here. Hats off to him (Morikawa).”</p>
    <p>Casey, 43, said that it was clear that Morikawa, in his short ca­reer on the PGA Tour so far, would be a force in the game.</p>
    <p>He’s not going any­where any­time soon. He’s a heck of a player. He doesn’t have a weak­ness in his game. He doesn’t have a weak­ness men­tally.</p>
    <p>“There’s al­ways a bunch of guys that rock up on the scene, and he didn’t nec­es­sar­ily get the most pub­lic­ity out of the group he was in, but you know, I can con­sider my­self vet­eran – I’ve been around the block – so I know tal­ent when I see it,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sch­ef­fler felt that with younger play­ers mak­ing waves and win­ners com­ing from any­where in the field, “golf is in a great spot”.</p>
    <p>“It seems like any­one can win on any given week, so it’s ex­cit­ing,” he said. “You saw it to­day, a lot of guys had a chance towards the end and con­grat­u­la­tions to Collin, he had a great back nine to­day and a good golf tour­na­ment. Yeah, I think golf is in a good place.”</p>

    <p>I’m free for the next three months if you need a cad­die or re­place­ment. No, J.J. (Jako­vac) is a great guy, but if you need me, I’m avail­able.</p>
