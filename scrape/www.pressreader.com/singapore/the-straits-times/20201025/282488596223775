    <p>FIC­TION</p>
    <p>By Bran­don Tay­lor/River­head/ Hard­cover/327pages/ $44.89/ Avail­able at bit.ly/RealLife_BTay­lor</p>
    <p>Wallace is a schol­ar­ship stu­dent from a poor fam­ily pur­su­ing post­grad­u­ate stud­ies in sci­ence at a univer­sity in the Mid­west. He also hap­pens to be gay and black.</p>
    <p>It is not so much his sex­u­al­ity or back­ground that threat­ens to dis­turb his idyl­lic stu­dent life. In­stead, he finds him­self in­creas­ingly an­gry and torn af­ter com­ing up against racism one too many times.</p>
    <p>Over a long week­end at the tailend of summer, Wallace, the only black per­son in his cir­cle, grows in in­ti­macy with an­other male stu­dent, Miller, and suf­fers an injustice that makes him con­tem­plate his fu­ture.</p>
    <p>This in­ci­sive de­but novel by black Amer­i­can writer Bran­don Tay­lor, who dropped out of a bio­chem­istry pro­gramme to take up writ­ing, takes a with­er­ing look at in­sid­i­ous racism in higher ed­u­ca­tion. It is one of six books short­listed for this year’s Booker Prize.</p>
    <p>Like Wallace, Tay­lor was raised in Alabama in the south­ern part of the United States and fur­thered his stud­ies in the Mid­west. He was an Iowa Arts Fel­low at the Iowa Writ­ers’ Work­shop in fic­tion.</p>
    <p>He gets un­der the skin of Wallace, who still feels the pain of child­hood abuse and finds him­self fac­ing cru­elty once more in the elite white en­vi­ron­ment which he has worked very hard to be part of.</p>
    <p>At a din­ner, a stu­dent named Ro­man tells Wallace it is “un­grate­ful” for him to con­sider quit­ting as the school had “brought you in know­ing what your de­fi­cien­cies were”.</p>
    <p>Wallace thinks about the ex­per­tise he has worked hard to ac­quire, but what Ro­man is re­fer­ring to “is in­stead a de­fi­ciency of white­ness, a lack of some req­ui­site same­ness”.</p>
    <p>Tay­lor skew­ers the com­plic­ity of Wallace’s friends. No­body at the din­ner speaks up for him. One of them laughs ner­vously.</p>
    <p>“They are al­ways laugh­ing. This is it, Wallace thinks. That’s how they get by. Si­lence and laugh­ter, si­lence and laugh­ter, switch and swing. The way one glides through this life with­out hav­ing to think about any­thing hard.”</p>
    <p>The irony stings when a stu­dent ac­cuses Wallace of be­ing a misog­y­nist when she her­self hurls racist and ho­mo­pho­bic in­sults at him.</p>
    <p>Wallace feels in­creas­ingly alien­ated but fears “real life” out­side cam­pus, where his prospects are bleak and peo­ple are, to him, “bloated and com­mer­cial and with so lit­tle de­sire in life ex­cept to see the next day”. But the racism that lies be­hind ivory tow­ers re­mains very real too.</p>
    <p>The novel strikes a note of hope with its ten­der de­pic­tion of Wallace’s re­la­tion­ship with Miller, who opens up to Wallace.</p>
    <p>Deeply com­pelling and ex­is­ten­tial, Real Life at­tempts to get to the heart of how peo­ple strug­gle to con­nect and the many ways in which they in­flict hurt on oth­ers.</p>
    <p>If you like this, read: Sally Rooney’s Con­ver­sa­tions With Friends (Faber & Faber, 2018, $19.26, avail­able at bit.ly/Conv WFriend­s_SRooney).</p>
    <p>Ir­ish writer Sally Rooney’s de­but novel, about the en­tan­gle­ment be­tween for­mer lovers Bobbi and Frances and mar­ried cou­ple Melissa and Nick, is an en­gross­ing read that of­fers sharp ob­ser­va­tions on how peo­ple hurt one an­other.</p>
