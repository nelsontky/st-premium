    <p>NEW YORK • The cat-and- mouse bat­tle be­tween ath­letes who cheat and those who try to find them has gone dig­i­tal.</p>
    <p>With a pro­lif­er­a­tion of on­line en­durance events dur­ing the pan­demic, catch­ing cheats is the chal­lenge faced by com­pa­nies like Zwift, which pro­duces an app that al­lows am­a­teur and pro­fes­sional cy­clists and run­ners to com­pete against one an­other from home.</p>
    <p>Now the com­pany is try­ing to crack down on so-called dig­i­tal dop­ing, or the prac­tice of ma­nip­u­lat­ing race data to im­prove dig­i­tal per­for­mances or cover up hu­man or tech­ni­cal er­rors.</p>
    <p>“There’s so much cheat­ing in Zwift that I think a lot of peo­ple would like to see more ac­count­abil­ity,” said Ray Maker, who writes the en­durance sports tech­nol­ogy blog DC Rain­maker.</p>
    <p>Yet pro­fes­sional ath­letes pub­licly ac­cused of gam­ing Zwift’s sys­tem have said they did not in­ten­tion­ally cheat and that they had been made scape­goats as the com­pany tries to show it is tak­ing the mat­ter se­ri­ously.</p>
    <p>The pres­sure has been on to get the process right, es­pe­cially lead­ing to a new event, the Cy­cling Es­ports World Cham­pi­onships, which the In­ter­na­tional Cy­cling Union, the global cy­cling gov­ern­ing body, hosted last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>South African Ash­leigh Mool­man and Ger­many’s Ja­son Os­borne be­came cy­cling’s first vir­tual world cham­pi­ons when they – or rather their avatars – won the 50km women’s and men’s race on the dig­i­tal roads of “Watopia”.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to tra­di­tional an­tidop­ing con­trols to bar the use of per­for­mance-en­hanc­ing drugs, data anal­y­sis was em­ployed to pre­vent dig­i­tal dop­ing. “We feel con­fi­dent in the abil­ity to catch cheaters and to po­lice the races,” said Zwift spokesman Chris Snook.</p>
    <p>A group called Zwift Ac­cu­racy and Data Anal­y­sis, made up of sports sci­en­tists and tech­ni­cal ex­perts, analy­ses race data.</p>
    <p>It looks at the rid­ers’ race files reg­is­tered on Zwift and on a sec­ond de­vice, and in­spects met­rics from power me­ters and heart rate mon­i­tors to com­pare the ath­letes’ dig­i­tal race per­for­mance to their past data.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants also had to sub­mit their height and weight through a recorded video process, pro­vid­ing ad­di­tional data that in­flu­ences the rider’s power per weight num­bers and fi­nal rank­ings.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the race, ath­letes had to man­u­ally up­load the sec­ond race file that they record on a sec­ond de­vice con­nected to a power me­ter (usu­ally a pedal or an­other de­vice in their crank arms or chain rings).</p>
    <p>This sec­ond file is used to dou­ble-check the va­lid­ity of the first file reg­is­tered on Zwift.</p>
    <p>There have been sev­eral ac­cu­sa­tions of dig­i­tal dop­ing since last year, when Bri­tish Cy­cling stripped Cam Jef­fers of his Cy­cling e-Rac­ing Cham­pi­onship ti­tle; bar­ring him from all races for six months.</p>
    <p>Last month, two rid­ers – Lizi Dun­combe of Bri­tain and Is­rael’s Shanni Berger of Is­rael – were banned for six months from Zwift races for “fab­ri­ca­tion or mod­i­fi­ca­tion of any data” and “bring­ing the sport into dis­re­pute”.</p>
