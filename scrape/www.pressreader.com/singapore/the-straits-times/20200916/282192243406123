    <p>Close to 100 part­ners, in­clud­ing ho­tels, food and bev­er­age out­lets, and schools, have pledged to re­duce food wastage and the use of dis­pos­ables as part of a Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) campaign that was launched on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>This is al­most dou­ble the num­ber from last year, when 59 part­ners took part in the first edi­tion of the Say Yes To Waste Less campaign.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies will en­cour­age their cus­tomers to plan their meals in ad­vance and to in­di­cate if they want smaller food por­tions so as to re­duce food wastage.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers will also re­ceive free food top­pings or l oy­alty points when they bring their own take­away con­tain­ers.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, bub­ble tea chain HeyTea of­fers cus­tomers a 50-cent dis­count when they bring their own tum­blers.</p>
    <p>Of the 95 or­gan­i­sa­tions sup­port­ing NEA’s campaign, 45 are new, while the re­main­ing 50 have been on board since last year.</p>
    <p>To­gether, they en­com­pass more than 2,100 premises this year.</p>
    <p>New­com­ers in­clude DBS Bank, which is the first bank to join the campaign.</p>
    <p>Since this month, DBS has part­nered Chope to of­fer dis­counts of up to 50 per cent at a slew of din­ing out­lets in the fi­nal hours be­fore clos­ing, to re­duce the amount of fresh pro­duce wasted.</p>
    <p>Also newly on board the campaign is home-grown cof­fee chain Huggs Cof­fee.</p>
    <p>The cof­fee shop will be re­pur­pos­ing used cof­fee grounds into life­style prod­ucts such as scrubs and fer­tilis­ers from this month.</p>
    <p>It also has plans to turn used cof­fee bags into totes.</p>
    <p>Food waste, which is one of the largest waste streams in Sin­ga­pore, has in­creased by about 20 per cent over the l ast 10 years, said NEA.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic gen­er­ated 744,000 tonnes of food waste last year.</p>
    <p>This is equiv­a­lent to each in­di­vid­ual dis­card­ing two bowls of food a day.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, of the domestic waste dis­posed of last year, 200,000 tonnes were dis­pos­ables, in­clud­ing items such as car­rier bags and take­away con­tain­ers.</p>
    <p>This amount is enough to fill 400 Olympic-size swim­ming pools.</p>
    <p>NEA chief ex­ec­u­tive Tan Meng Dui said that he was en­cour­aged by the grow­ing num­ber of part­ners who have come on board to sup­port the agency’s anti-waste campaign.</p>
    <p>“We hope to mo­bilise more of the pub­lic to­wards the habit of bring­ing their own reusables and re­duc­ing food wastage, to cre­ate a more sus­tain­able fu­ture for Sin­ga­pore,” he added.</p>
    <p>Food waste has in­creased by about 20 per cent over the last 10 years, said NEA.</p>
