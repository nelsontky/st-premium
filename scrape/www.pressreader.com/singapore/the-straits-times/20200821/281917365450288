    <p>WASHINGTON • Steve Ban­non, an ar­chi­tect of Amer­i­can Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s 2016 elec­tion vic­tory, has been charged with fundrais­ing fraud in a cam­paign that claimed it would help Mr Trump build his sig­na­ture wall on the USMex­ico bor­der, the US Jus­tice Depart­ment said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ban­non was among sev­eral peo­ple charged with wire fraud in an in­dict­ment by fed­eral pros­e­cu­tors in Man­hat­tan for al­legedly de­fraud­ing hun­dreds of thou­sands of donors through a US$25 mil­lion (S$34 mil­lion) crowd­fund­ing cam­paign called “We Build the Wall”.</p>
    <p>“As al­leged, the de­fen­dants de­frauded hun­dreds of thou­sands of donors, cap­i­tal­is­ing on their in­ter­est in fund­ing a bor­der wall to raise mil­lions of dol­lars, un­der the false pre­tence that all of that money would be spent on con­struc­tion,” US at­tor­ney Au­drey Strauss said in a press re­lease yes­ter­day, re­ported Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>Pros­e­cu­tors said Ban­non re­ceived more than US$1 mil­lion of that money through a non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion. MSNBC re­ported that Ban­non is ex­pected to plead not guilty to the charges.</p>
    <p>As a top ad­viser to Mr Trump’s pres­i­den­tial cam­paign who later served as chief White House strate­gist, Ban­non helped ar­tic­u­late the right-wing pop­ulism and fierce op­po­si­tion to im­mi­gra­tion that have helped de­fine Mr Trump’s 31 /</p>
    <p>2 years in of­fice.</p>
    <p>Ban­non left the White House in Au­gust 2017, re­ported Reuters.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s sig­na­ture ef­fort to build a wall along the US-Mex­ico bor­der – a key 2016 cam­paign prom­ise – has strug­gled amid court chal­lenges, lo­gis­ti­cal hur­dles and op­po­si­tion from Democrats in Congress.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, more than 330,000 sup­port­ers have do­nated to pri­vate fund-rais­ers and prof­i­teers who have promised to build the wall on their own, ac­cord­ing to a 2019 Reuters in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>Those ef­forts like­wise have met with lim­ited suc­cess.</p>
    <p>The in­dict­ment comes as Mr Trump trails in opin­ion polls be­hind Demo­cratic chal­lenger Joe Bi­den ahead of the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Ban­non could not be im­me­di­ately reached for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Also charged were Brian Kolfage, An­drew Badolato and Ti­mothy Shea.</p>
    <p>Kolfage, who pros­e­cu­tors de­scribed as the pub­lic face and founder of the op­er­a­tion, re­ceived thou­sands of dol­lars that he used to fund a lav­ish life­style.</p>
    <p>Kolfage was due to ap­pear in fed­eral court yes­ter­day in Florida, while Ban­non was set to ap­pear in fed­eral court in Man­hat­tan.</p>
    <p>The other two de­fen­dants were due to ap­pear in courts in the Mid­dle Dis­trict of Florida and Colorado.</p>
    <p>Web­site Ax­ios re­ported that Ban­non is the sixth per­son linked to the 2016 Trump cam­paign to be hit with fed­eral charges.</p>
    <p>The oth­ers are Roger Stone, Michael Flynn, Rick Gates, Paul Manafort and Michael Co­hen.</p>
