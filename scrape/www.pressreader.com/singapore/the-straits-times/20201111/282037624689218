    <p>Three new fea­tures have been rolled out on the na­tional jobs por­tal MyCa­reer­sFu­ture to strengthen pro­gres­sive hir­ing prac­tices among em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>In a joint state­ment yes­ter­day, Work­force Sin­ga­pore (WSG), the Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Fair and Pro­gres­sive Em­ploy­ment Prac­tices (Tafep) and the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) said a key thrust of the por­tal is to “pro­vide as many job seek­ers as pos­si­ble a fair chance at the roles ad­ver­tised”.</p>
    <p>These are the new fea­tures, which aim to set a new stan­dard for other job por­tals to fol­low.</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>PROMPT­ING EM­PLOY­ERS TO ABIDE BY GUIDE­LINES WHEN POST­ING JOB ADS</p>
    <p>An Em­ployer Prompt fea­ture re­minds em­ploy­ers to ad­here to the Tri­par­tite Guide­lines on Fair Em­ploy­ment Prac­tices (TGFEP) when craft­ing job post­ings, and be­fore they are pub­lished on MyCa­reer­sFu­ture.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>BET­TER GUID­ANCE FOR EM­PLOY­ERS TO CRAFT NEU­TRAL JOB ADS</p>
    <p>So­cial lis­ten­ing tech­nol­ogy is used to re­view all job post­ings listed on</p>
    <p>MyCa­reer­sFu­ture, and po­ten­tially dis­crim­i­na­tory terms or men­tions are flagged to em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers will be guided on how they can im­prove their job post­ings to at­tract and find the most suit­able can­di­dates, said the agen­cies. Em­ploy­ers will also be ex­pected to amend dis­crim­i­na­tory job ad­ver­tise­ments.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>MAK­ING IT EAS­IER TO RE­PORT POS­SI­BLE DIS­CRIM­I­NA­TION</p>
    <p>The Re­port Dis­crim­i­na­tory Job Ads fea­ture al­lows job seek­ers to con­ve­niently re­port any ob­jec­tion­able post­ing they come across on MyCa­reer­sFu­ture. Tafep will re­view the re­ports and in­ves­ti­gate any breaches of the TGFEP.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s an­nounce­ment comes amid con­cerns from lo­cal job seek­ers that they are not get­ting a fair deal in a tough labour mar­ket, and that some em­ploy­ers are bi­ased against Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, a fresh group of 47 em­ploy­ers were placed on the Fair Con­sid­er­a­tion Frame­work (FCF) watch list for po­ten­tially dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices.</p>
    <p>Since Jan­uary, the min­istry has sus­pended the work pass priv­i­leges of 90 em­ploy­ers un­der the frame­work, of which 45 were due to the post­ing of dis­crim­i­na­tory job ad­ver­tise­ments.</p>
    <p>The FCF was in­tro­duced in 2014 to main­tain a strong Sin­ga­porean core in pro­fes­sional, man­ager, ex­ec­u­tive and tech­ni­cian (PMET) jobs. It sets out the re­quire­ments for em­ploy­ers to con­sider the lo­cal work­force fairly for open­ings, in­clud­ing those for job ad­ver­tise­ments.</p>
    <p>WSG, Tafep and MOM said all em­ploy­ers must en­sure that they do not use phrases that in­di­cate a pref­er­ence for cer­tain groups of staff.</p>
    <p>They cited the ex­am­ple of a pri­vate school which posted an ad­ver­tise­ment for a le­gal man­ager on MyCa­reer­sFu­ture in July, stat­ing its pref­er­ence for can­di­dates aged be­low 30.</p>
    <p>As the po­si­tion in­volved more than 60 busi­ness trips a year, the em­ployer had as­sumed that older em­ploy­ees would not be able to cope with the fre­quent travel.</p>
    <p>For breach­ing the TGFEP, the em­ployer was barred from hir­ing for­eign­ers and re­new­ing the work passes of its ex­ist­ing for­eign em­ploy­ees for 12 months.</p>
    <p>Tafep gen­eral man­ager Faith Li said: “We look for­ward to work­ing with more job por­tals so that more em­ploy­ers and job seek­ers can ben­e­fit from fair and pro­gres­sive em­ploy­ment prac­tices.”</p>
    <p>Dr Joyce Tan, WSG’s direc­tor for dig­i­tal ex­pe­ri­ence for ca­reer ser­vices, said: “To build an in­clu­sive hir­ing cul­ture is cru­cial in this cli­mate and we are glad to be able to play our part to em­power the pub­lic to be in­volved through the use of tech­nol­ogy.”</p>
