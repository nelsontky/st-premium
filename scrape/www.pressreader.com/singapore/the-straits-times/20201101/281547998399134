    <p>SEX­UAL MIS­CON­DUCT CASES</p>
    <p>Where there is the pos­si­bil­ity that such an of­fence was com­mit­ted, they will re­port the case to po­lice for in­ves­ti­ga­tion.’’</p>
    <p>A MIN­ISTRY OF ED­U­CA­TION SPOKESMAN, on uni­ver­si­ties here con­duct­ing in­ter­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions when alerted to al­leged of­fences.</p>
    <p>More than a year af­ter the Mon­ica Baey voyeurism saga, Sin­ga­pore uni­ver­si­ties are still grap­pling with in­ci­dents of sex­ual mis­con­duct. The Sun­day Times looks at what has been done to ad­dress the prob­lem, and how there is still room for im­prove­ment in the way such cases are han­dled.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, Ms Lynn Neo started lock­ing the door of her hos­tel room when­ever she took a nap.</p>
    <p>The third-year busi­ness stu­dent at the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) would also keep a look­out for men en­ter­ing the toi­let when she was in the shower, and would not let strangers – men or women – fol­low her into her res­i­den­tial col­lege.</p>
    <p>She and other friends be­gan tak­ing pre­cau­tions like th­ese im­me­di­ately af­ter they heard about a 24-year-old male stu­dent at NUS who had mounted two spy­cams in women’s toi­lets in their col­lege.</p>
    <p>He was ar­rested by the po­lice and sus­pended by NUS.</p>
    <p>Ms Neo, 21, said the in­ci­dent in March spooked some of her col­lege mates. “I had al­ways felt safe ini­tially be­cause there wasn’t a sin­gle voyeurism case in my col­lege, but the spy­cam in­ci­dent made some of us more para­noid and wor­ried for our safety.”</p>
    <p>She is not the only one.</p>
    <p>In a sur­vey com­mis­sioned by The Sun­day Times two weeks ago, nearly 60 per cent of stu­dents re­ported that they were tak­ing pre­cau­tions such as us­ing busier routes to get around cam­pus.</p>
    <p>The lat­est sex­ual-mis­con­duct al­le­ga­tions – by two fe­male stu­dents against for­mer Tem­busu Col­lege don Jeremy Fer­nando – trig­gered more un­easi­ness, with over 80 per cent in the poll say­ing they felt con­cerned about the case, which in­cluded ac­cu­sa­tions of non-con­sen­sual sex­ual ad­vances such as kiss­ing, grop­ing and oral sex.</p>
    <p>But the sur­vey by on­line mar­ket re­search firm Milieu In­sight also un­cov­ered some pos­i­tive as­pects. About 40 per cent of stu­dents polled said they were sat­is­fied with ac­tions taken by the uni­ver­si­ties to com­bat sex­ual ha­rass­ment in the past year.</p>
    <p>Still, a fifth of the re­spon­dents were not sat­is­fied, and 35 per cent said they felt “neu­tral”. About 40 per cent felt their uni­ver­sity was on the right track.</p>
    <p>In all, 440 un­der­grad­u­ates from</p>
    <p>NUS and Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Uni­ver­sity (NTU) were sur­veyed.</p>
    <p>Most of the 15 stu­dents and re­cent alumni in­ter­viewed by The Sun­day Times said there has been progress made by lo­cal uni­ver­si­ties in com­ing down harder on sex­ual of­fences since the vic­tim of a voyeur on cam­pus went pub­lic in April last year.</p>
    <p>For­mer un­der­grad­u­ate Mon­ica Baey had been filmed show­er­ing at Eu­soff Hall by an­other stu­dent in 2018. She said NUS asked the per­pe­tra­tor to write an apol­ogy to her and un­dergo coun­selling.</p>
    <p>NUS later con­firmed that the case was in­ves­ti­gated by the po­lice and the man was given a 12-month con­di­tional warn­ing by the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>This prompted a na­tional de­bate about how sex­ual mis­con­duct cases were dealt with in uni­ver­si­ties here, af­ter Ms Baey ex­pressed her frus­tra­tion over the per­ceived light pun­ish­ment meted out to the per­pe­tra­tor.</p>
    <p>In the af­ter­math, NUS ac­cepted rec­om­men­da­tions such as tougher penal­ties for Peep­ing Tom of­fences. The out­cry also led to NUS and other uni­ver­si­ties step­ping up se­cu­rity in their dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>MORE TIME NEEDED FOR CHANGE</p>
    <p>The up­roar shone a spot­light on the gaps that needed to be filled, said stu­dents, and brought about a greater recog­ni­tion that sex­ual ha­rass­ment in higher learn­ing in­sti­tu­tions can­not be treated lightly.</p>
    <p>NTU third-year pub­lic pol­icy and global af­fairs stu­dent Bryan Chiew, 23, said: “The in­ci­dent was a cat­a­lyst for change. It def­i­nitely gal­vanised not just vic­tims to speak out but my peers to be more vo­cal in dis­cus­sions.”</p>
    <p>Ef­forts by the lo­cal uni­ver­si­ties to tackle the is­sue in the past year have not gone un­no­ticed.</p>
    <p>Ms Neo, who moved out of her res­i­den­tial col­lege dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, said: “Cam­pus se­cu­rity can be seen pa­trolling more of­ten now, even late at night. There are also more warn­ing posters telling us that CCTVs are in op­er­a­tion, and the num­ber we should call for help if we spot any sus­pi­cious peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>NUS and the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Uni­ver­sity have set up units ded­i­cated to help­ing vic­tims of sex­ual mis­con­duct. In tan­dem with tougher penal­ties for of­fend­ers, uni­ver­si­ties have also put out more in­for­ma­tion on sex­ual ha­rass­ment and in­tro­duced com­pul­sory mod­ules on re­spect and con­sent.</p>
    <p>At Yale-NUS Col­lege, apart from a manda­tory ses­sion for all fresh­men on con­sent and re­spect, more is be­ing done to make sure staff are on the same page on how to han­dle sex­ual ha­rass­ment. This year, the col­lege up­dated its sex­ual mis­con­duct pol­icy and pro­ce­dures for staff and fac­ulty, and con­ducted a train­ing pro­gramme for them.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) said it has been work­ing with the uni­ver­si­ties to re­view and step up ef­forts to tackle such mis­con­duct.</p>
    <p>An MOE spokesman said the uni­ver­si­ties con­duct their own in­ter­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions when alerted to al­leged of­fences. “Separately, where there is the pos­si­bil­ity that such an of­fence was com­mit­ted, they will re­port the case to po­lice for in­ves­ti­ga­tion,” she added.</p>
    <p>If a stu­dent or staff mem­ber has breached the code of con­duct, he will be sub­ject to dis­ci­plinary sanc­tions, which could in­clude sus­pen­sion or ex­pul­sion, or – for staff – even dis­missal, she said.</p>
    <p>NUS fi­nal-year his­tory and so­cial work dou­ble ma­jor Jeremiah Tan, 24, said stiffer penal­ties for those who com­mit sex­ual of­fences work to some ex­tent as a de­ter­rent.</p>
    <p>“It makes peo­ple think twice about their ac­tions,” he said.</p>
    <p>But se­cu­rity and puni­tive mea­sures are not enough to ad­dress the root causes of sex­ual mis­con­duct, said Ms Carissa Cheow, 25, co-founder of Stu­dents for a Safer NUS, a ground-up group formed in Oc­to­ber last year.</p>
    <p>The group wants to do more by en­gag­ing the stu­dent body about such top­ics and ex­tend­ing sup­port to stu­dents who need help. It is also re­search­ing poli­cies and best prac­tices over­seas.</p>
    <p>How­ever, no one ex­pects change to hap­pen overnight.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­a­tion of Women for Ac­tion and Re­search ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor</p>
    <p>Corinna Lim said: “The gen­der dy­nam­ics that un­der­pin sex­ual vi­o­lence are mil­len­nia old and not likely to dis­ap­pear any time soon.</p>
    <p>“We are glad to see that many uni­ver­si­ties in Sin­ga­pore have, in the wake of re­cent cases, stepped up their vic­tim sup­port and penalty frame­works. But those steps must go hand in hand with ed­u­ca­tional cam­paigns about em­pa­thy, con­sent, healthy re­la­tion­ships and gen­der-based vi­o­lence at all lev­els of so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>BROADER PROB­LEM</p>
    <p>Sex­ual ha­rass­ment is not limited to uni­ver­si­ties, said ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Lim: “Gen­er­ally speak­ing, sex­ual vi­o­lence – whether as­sault, voyeurism or other forms of ha­rass­ment – hap­pens on uni­ver­sity cam­puses for many of the same rea­sons it hap­pens else­where.”</p>
    <p>Sex­ual ob­jec­ti­fi­ca­tion of women is deeply in­grained in so­ci­ety and vic­tim-blam­ing at­ti­tudes per­pet­u­ate th­ese acts, she said.</p>
    <p>The uni­ver­si­ties do not di­vulge fig­ures of sex­ual mis­con­duct cases pub­licly, and to date, have also not shared any data from sur­veys to de­ter­mine how preva­lent the prob­lem is on cam­puses.</p>
    <p>In Par­lia­ment last year, then Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said the uni­ver­si­ties han­dled 56 such cases in the 2015 to 2017 aca­demic years.</p>
    <p>Two-thirds of the cases were re­lated to voyeurism – which ex­perts said stems from an over­ex­po­sure to sex­ual ma­te­ri­als on­line, like pornog­ra­phy, from a young age.</p>
    <p>Mr De­lane Lim, founder of youth lead­er­ship train­ing firm Fu­tuready Asia (Sin­ga­pore), said: “Some boys as young as 10 are al­ready ex­posed to porn, whether know­ingly or not.</p>
    <p>“By the time they reach a cer­tain age, they’re ex­per­i­ment­ing with what sex­ual grat­i­fi­ca­tion can look like in real life. If not pro­fes­sion­ally treated for this com­pul­sion, it can man­i­fest later, as a young adult in uni­ver­sity, in a crav­ing to get more images with­out be­ing caught.”</p>
    <p>Crim­i­nal lawyer Su­nil Sud­heesan, who has seen an uptick in voyeurism of­fences in re­cent years, said ad­vances in cam­era phone tech­nol­ogy have her­alded a new realm of sex­ual mis­con­duct.</p>
    <p>“In the past, there were guys peep­ing at girls show­er­ing, as op­posed to now, guys are tak­ing videos of girls show­er­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>Clin­i­cal psy­chol­o­gist Cherie Chan from Thrive Clinic said peo­ple tend to be more brazen in uni­ver­sity hos­tels as they have more free­dom with­out their par­ents’ pres­ence to “do things that they may not be able to do at home or out­side”.</p>
    <p>She said: “It is likely that it leads to peo­ple feed­ing off this en­ergy and be­ing more will­ing to en­gage in th­ese risky be­hav­iours as well.”</p>
    <p>HIGHER STAN­DARDS</p>
    <p>While sex­ual ha­rass­ment can hap­pen any­where, cases on uni­ver­sity cam­puses tend to at­tract more pub­lic at­ten­tion, said ob­servers.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim said: “It is not clear the sit­u­a­tion is any worse on cam­puses than off cam­puses. Cam­pus sex­ual vi­o­lence cases do seem to get a lot of pub­lic at­ten­tion, per­haps be­cause so­ci­ety ex­pects cam­puses to be safe places for youth.”</p>
    <p>This is even more so when of­fences are per­pe­trated by staff, be­cause of the un­equal po­si­tions of power.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Lim: “On uni­ver­sity cam­puses, stu­dents are rel­a­tively young – most are just en­ter­ing adult­hood – and thus may be more vul­ner­a­ble to sex­ual abuse than older adults. They may find them­selves in sit­u­a­tions or ac­tiv­i­ties they may not be equipped to han­dle, at the hands of fac­ulty mem­bers or staff who are in po­si­tions of author­ity, power or trust.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lim said: “Cor­po­ra­tions typ­i­cally don’t in­form em­ploy­ees about any­one’s dis­missal due to per­sonal in­dis­cre­tion. But it’s dif­fer­ent in the case of an ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tion. So­ci­ety has high re­gard for pro­fes­sors, and they have an obli­ga­tion to take care of their charges.”</p>
    <p>Stu­dents said they also ex­pect in­sti­tu­tions to be trans­par­ent about sex­ual mis­con­duct. All 15 stu­dents The Sun­day Times spoke to felt that NUS failed to give timely and ad­e­quate up­dates about the com­plaints re­gard­ing Dr Fer­nando, al­though they ac­knowl­edged it is not easy to bal­ance the de­mands of shar­ing in­for­ma­tion and pro­tect­ing vic­tims’ pri­vacy.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Neo: “When we don’t get any in­for­ma­tion from the school, we spec­u­late. None of us know what is re­ally hap­pen­ing and we do not know who and what to be­lieve.</p>
    <p>“Would they have swept it un­der the car­pet and not in­formed us if the me­dia hadn’t re­ported it?”</p>
    <p>NUS re­ceived a com­plaint about</p>
    <p>Dr Fer­nando on Aug 27. A sec­ond com­plaint was made on Sept 7. It sacked him on Oct 7 and re­leased a pub­lic state­ment on Oct 18, the day staff and stu­dents at Tem­busu Col­lege were told of his dis­missal.</p>
    <p>A day ear­lier, on Oct 17, a col­lege alum­nus had put up a Face­book post about the case and crit­i­cised the col­lege for its in­ac­tion and lack of clar­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Chiew said in­sti­tu­tions should in­form stu­dents of such cases, maybe with names redacted and sen­si­tive in­for­ma­tion re­moved.</p>
    <p>He said: “I think this will go some way to­wards be­ing more trans­par­ent while also act­ing as a de­ter­rent. I think I speak for the ma­jor­ity of NTU stu­dents that we only find out about such cases when they come out on the news.</p>
    <p>“Once there is suf­fi­cient ev­i­dence that an in­ci­dent has taken place, the school should try to be as trans­par­ent as pos­si­ble with the uni­ver­sity com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“Too of­ten, this sort of news spreads by word of mouth and ru­mours, which are not the most con­struc­tive. More com­mu­ni­ca­tion is needed.”</p>
    <p>An NUS Stu­dents’ Union spokesman said: “The re­cent in­ci­dent has sur­faced con­cerns of the clar­ity and time­li­ness of com­mu­ni­ca­tion to the gen­eral stu­dent pop­u­la­tion on se­ri­ous is­sues such as staff mis­con­duct, and the lack of in­for­ma­tion pro­vided to stu­dents on steps be­ing taken by the uni­ver­sity to en­sure a safe cam­pus en­vi­ron­ment.”</p>
    <p>The union will con­tinue to en­gage with NUS se­nior man­age­ment to en­sure greater ac­count­abil­ity, fair and trans­par­ent in­ves­ti­ga­tion pro­cesses and ad­e­quate sup­port struc­tures for vic­tims, the spokesman said.</p>
    <p>PUSH TO DO MORE</p>
    <p>Uni­ver­si­ties world­wide are try­ing to tackle the prob­lem of sex­ual mis­con­duct.</p>
    <p>In Bri­tain, a task force was set up in 2015 to study how to com­bat ha­rass­ment in uni­ver­si­ties and pro­vide rec­om­men­da­tions. It also con­ducted sur­veys of nearly 100 in­sti­tu­tions to gauge progress and un­der­stand the chal­lenges they faced.</p>
    <p>The As­so­ci­a­tion of Amer­i­can Uni­ver­si­ties re­leased a large-scale re­port af­ter polling more than 180,000 stu­dents on sex­ual as­sault and mis­con­duct last year, to high­light how var­si­ties can do bet­ter.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore’s case, Ms Lim sug­gested that the Gov­ern­ment set up a na­tional code and stan­dards on sex­ual vi­o­lence in uni­ver­si­ties, mod­elled af­ter the Tri­par­tite Ad­vi­sory on Man­ag­ing Work­place Ha­rass­ment, with adap­ta­tions made for the cam­pus set­ting.</p>
    <p>An­other pos­si­bil­ity is to set up an in­de­pen­dent body to deal with uni­ver­sity sex­ual vi­o­lence, she said. It could com­prise ex­pe­ri­enced in­ves­ti­ga­tors, and a panel could man­age in­ves­ti­ga­tions, en­sure safety stan­dards in uni­ver­si­ties and train­ing for on-cam­pus staff.</p>
    <p>It can also con­duct an­nual stu­dent, staff and fac­ulty cli­mate polls, and carry out in­sti­tu­tional au­dits of re­sponses to sex­ual mis­con­duct.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Tan: “I don’t think what we are see­ing are iso­lated in­ci­dents. There are prob­a­bly a lot more cases that go un­re­ported. It’s not just the uni­ver­sity’s prob­lem, but a so­ci­etal one. The so­lu­tion, in ad­di­tion to pre­ven­tive mea­sures, is to em­pha­sise the need for val­ues, apart from aca­demics.</p>
    <p>“The uni­ver­sity as a col­lec­tive has to de­cide what cul­ture it wants and go back to help­ing stu­dents re­spect bound­aries and em­pathise with each other.”</p>
