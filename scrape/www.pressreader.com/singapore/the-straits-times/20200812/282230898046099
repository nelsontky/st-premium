    <p>BER­LIN • Ger­many agreed on Mon­day to ex­tend a ban for spec­ta­tors in sta­di­ums at Bun­desliga football matches un­til at least the end of Oc­to­ber due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the au­thor­i­ties said.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man league restarted in mid-May af­ter a sus­pen­sion of more than two months, be­com­ing the first Euro­pean league to re­sume un­der strict rules to con­tain the spread of the Covid-19 disease.</p>
    <p>Last week, the clubs in Ger­many’s top-two leagues agreed to the Bun­desliga’s plans to al­low the par­tial re­turn of fans when the new league season be­gins on Sept 18, but re­it­er­ated that it was sub­ject to gov­ern­ment ap­proval.</p>
    <p>Borus­sia Dort­mund had al­ready be­gun to ex­plore plans to ad­mit up to 16,000 peo­ple at its West­falen­sta­dion home and the Ger­man Football League had hoped the au­thor­i­ties would ac­cept an up­dated pro­posal to al­low spec­ta­tors again un­der cer­tain con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>But the health min­is­ters of Ger­many’s fed­eral and 16 state gov­ern­ments have re­jected the pro­posal, point­ing to a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry of the state of Ber­lin said: “In par­tic­u­lar, lo­cal health au­thor­i­ties are cur­rently fo­cused on con­tact trac­ing, the school start and the re­turn of hol­i­day trav­ellers.”</p>
    <p>As other ma­jor events in Ger­many re­mained banned un­til the end of Oc­to­ber, on top of the can­cel­la­tion of Ok­to­ber­fest – the world’s big­gest and most fa­mous beer fes­ti­val – the min­is­ters agreed that no ex­cep­tion could be made for football matches, adding that their de­ci­sion would not be re­vis­ited be­fore the au­tumn.</p>
    <p>“We need to stay vig­i­lant. In the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion, spec­ta­tors in the sta­di­ums would be the wrong sig­nal,” the coun­try’s Health Min­is­ter Jens Spahn tweeted, also high­light­ing an uptick in cases.</p>
    <p>“Thou­sands of spec­ta­tors in the sta­di­ums – that is not suit­able given the in­fec­tion rate.</p>
    <p>“Now is not the time to take any avoid­able risks.”</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials have re­peat­edly urged lo­cals to stick with such pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures as so­cial dis­tanc­ing and the wear­ing of masks.</p>
    <p>But the ris­ing num­ber of in­fec­tions sug­gest some have be­come less care­ful dur­ing the sum­mer months.</p>
    <p>Ger­many re­ported over 218,000 cases and 9,265 deaths as of yes­ter­day.</p>
