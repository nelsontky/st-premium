    <p>Af­ter 162 years, depart­ment store stal­wart Robin­sons is throw­ing in the towel. It said yes­ter­day it is clos­ing its last two depart­ment stores here at The Heeren and Raf­fles City Shop­ping Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The re­tailer said the de­ci­sion to liq­ui­date its stores was prompted by a range of fac­tors, in­clud­ing chang­ing con­sumer tastes and cost pres­sures such as rent.</p>
    <p>“The over­ar­ch­ing busi­ness model of depart­ment stores is out­dated,” it said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>While the re­tailer’s e-com­merce plat­forms are no l onger op­er­a­tional, shop­pers can con­tinue to visit its bricks-and-mor­tar stores for the time be­ing.</p>
    <p>The last day for the two phys­i­cal stores is not clear. Robin­sons said the ap­pointed liq­uida­tors are in ne­go­ti­a­tions with the land­lords, but “we hope that the stores will stay open for the com­ing weeks”.</p>
    <p>Robin­sons stores in Malaysia, lo­cated at Shoppes at Four Sea­sons Place and The Gar­dens Mall, will also be liq­ui­dated.</p>
    <p>But other re­tail­ers un­der the Al-Fut­taim Group, which in­clude Marks & Spencer and Zara, will not be af­fected, a spokesman has con­firmed.</p>
    <p>Mr Danny Lim, Robin­sons’ se­nior gen­eral man­ager, said: “We re­gret this out­come to­day. De­spite re­cent chal­lenges in the in­dus­try, the Robin­sons team con­tin­ued to pur­sue the suc­cess of the brand.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, the chang­ing con­sumer land­scape makes it dif­fi­cult for us to suc­ceed over the long term, and the Covid-19 pan­demic has fur­ther ex­ac­er­bated our chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>“We have en­joyed suc­cess over the years, and it has been an hon­our for Robin­sons to serve the Sin­ga­pore mar­ket. I am grate­ful for the ded­i­ca­tion of our team, and for the sup­port shown by our cus­tomers over the years.”</p>
    <p>Robin­sons said chang­ing re­tail trends brought about by the rise of e-com­merce and lower de­mand for depart­ment stores are to blame for slump­ing sales, a prob­lem made worse by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Robin­sons was bought by the Dubai-based Al-Fut­taim Group in 2008 for $600 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The chain suf­fered losses for at least the last six years from shrink­ing sales, The Busi­ness Times re­ported. In 2018, it sank $54.4 mil­lion into the red af­ter rev­enue fell to $153.8 mil­lion. In con­trast, 2014’s turnover was $257.3 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>In the third quar­ter of this year, Robin­sons closed its Jem out­let.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the re­tailer’s an­nounce­ment yes­ter­day, OCBC Bank said it is can­celling its OCBC Robin­sons Credit Card from April 15 next year.</p>
    <p>Mr Vin­cent Tan, head of cards busi­ness at OCBC, said: “We are grate­ful to have been able to part­ner Robin­sons in a suc­cess­ful co­branded credit card plat­form in Sin­ga­pore over the past 18 years.”</p>
    <p>Robin­sons also en­cour­aged all cus­tomers hold­ing on to gift cards and vouch­ers to re­deem them as soon as pos­si­ble. “The stores in Sin­ga­pore will ac­cept Robin­sons... gift cards and vouch­ers dur­ing the liq­ui­da­tion process and for as long as the stores re­main open,” it said.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers were told yes­ter­day that vouch­ers can be used only for pur­chases of at least twice the voucher value. So, a $20 voucher can be used only with a min­i­mum spend of $40, for in­stance.</p>
    <p>Cor­po­rate ad­vi­sory and re­struc­tur­ing firm Kor­daMen­tha’s Mr Cameron Dun­can and Mr David Kim have been ap­pointed pro­vi­sional liq­uida­tors.</p>
    <p>They will take con­trol of the com­pany’s as­sets and as­sess op­tions to re­alise value to max­imise re­turns to cred­i­tors, in­clud­ing em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>For the liq­ui­da­tion of Robin­sons’ two stores i n Malaysia, Datuk Robert Teo Keng Tuan of RSM Malaysia was ap­pointed yes­ter­day as in­terim liq­uida­tor.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted, Raf­fles City Sin­ga­pore said it is in dis­cus­sions with Robin­sons on the smooth han­dover of the premises. “Shop­pers can look for­ward to a re­freshed Raf­fles City ten­ant mix with the in­tro­duc­tion of ex­cit­ing of­fer­ings. More de­tails will be shared in due course,” it added.</p>
    <p>De­spite re­cent chal­lenges in the in­dus­try, the Robin­sons team con­tin­ued to pur­sue the suc­cess of the brand. How­ever, the chang­ing con­sumer land­scape makes it dif­fi­cult for us to suc­ceed over the long term, and the Covid-19 pan­demic has fur­ther ex­ac­er­bated our chal­lenges.</p>
