    <p>Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said the world is chang­ing with Covid-19 and Sin­ga­pore must po­si­tion it­self to take ad­van­tage of fresh op­por­tu­ni­ties. Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy con­tracted 6.7 per cent in the first half of this year and is ex­pected to shrink by be­tween 5 per cent and 7 per cent this year, he said at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence on the sec­ond-quar­ter re­sults.</p>
    <p>This is our worst quar­terly per­for­mance on record. The fore­cast for 2020 es­sen­tially means the growth gen­er­ated over the past two to three years will be negated.</p>
    <p>The num­bers re­flect the im­pact of Covid-19, as well as deeper forces re­shap­ing the global econ­omy and our po­si­tion in the global value chains.</p>
    <p>I know that some are still hop­ing for a quick re­cov­ery, and a re­turn to the fa­mil­iar­ity of the “old nor­mal”.</p>
    <p>The painful truth is this: We are not re­turn­ing to a pre-Covid-19 world. Re­cov­ery will still be some time yet and the re­cov­ery is not likely to be smooth. We can ex­pect recurring waves of in­fec­tion and dis­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, re­cov­ery will be un­even across sec­tors. Some sec­tors will pro­gres­sively re­cover, while oth­ers will be per­ma­nently changed. We have to start now to build a new econ­omy, and to cre­ate more and bet­ter job op­por­tu­ni­ties for our peo­ple. We can­not wait for Covid-19 to blow over. The world has changed ir­re­vo­ca­bly in four ar­eas.</p>
    <p>CHANG­ING GEOPOL­I­TICS</p>
    <p>First, the geopo­lit­i­cal en­vi­ron­ment which had al­lowed us to thrive in the last 50 years has changed. The ten­sions amongst the ma­jor pow­ers are in­creas­ing. The com­pe­ti­tion and ten­sion per­me­ate not just politics, but also trade, tech­nol­ogy and se­cu­rity. And be­cause the ben­e­fits of glob­al­i­sa­tion have been un­evenly dis­trib­uted, the mer­its of free trade and global in­te­gra­tion are in­creas­ingly be­ing ques­tioned.</p>
    <p>We hope that the geopo­lit­i­cal is­sues will not spill into open con­flict that will fur­ther desta­bilise the rest of the world. We must avoid be­ing caught be­tween the con­flicts of ma­jor pow­ers, or be stranded in a frag­ment­ing world of trade re­la­tions and tech­no­log­i­cal stan­dards.</p>
    <p>One sim­ple ex­am­ple of the chal­lenges – if we do business in China, we com­mu­ni­cate with our Chi­nese coun­ter­parts by WeChat. They can’t ac­cess What­sApp. If we do business in the US, we use What­sApp. WeChat may not even be avail­able in the US in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Fric­tions like these will be in­evitable in a more com­pli­cated world.</p>
    <p>CHANG­ING SUP­PLY CHAINS</p>
    <p>The sec­ond fac­tor is the way global com­pa­nies are re­or­gan­is­ing their pro­duc­tion and sup­ply chains.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies are re­view­ing the need for re­gional hubs, thanks to dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy and ubiq­ui­tous com­mu­ni­ca­tions. A few have de­cided to just have one global HQ, and a few lo­cal cen­tres where their cus­tomers, pro­duc­tion or spe­cialised tal­ent are.</p>
    <p>Man­u­fac­tur­ers are re­view­ing where their fac­to­ries are sited.</p>
    <p>Many are shift­ing from a fo­cus on ef­fi­ciency or “just in time” to re­silience or “just in case”.</p>
    <p>They want to di­ver­sify their op­er­a­tions, mar­kets and sup­ply chains, so that they are not de­pen­dent on any one site.</p>
    <p>On one hand, new in­vest­ments will come our way. For in­stance, some man­u­fac­tur­ers are think­ing of a “China plus one” strat­egy and ac­tively look­ing at Asean, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, some ex­ist­ing in­vest­ments may di­ver­sify away from Sin­ga­pore, es­pe­cially where Sin­ga­pore is the sole man­u­fac­tur­ing site for some MNCs.</p>
    <p>It is a fluid land­scape and we must do every­thing we can to de­fend our ca­pa­bil­i­ties and ca­pac­i­ties while win­ning new ones.</p>
    <p>We must also har­ness our com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tages of le­gal cer­tainty, in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty pro­tec­tion, con­nec­tiv­ity, pol­icy con­sis­tency and co­her­ence to over­come our con­straints in land and labour.</p>
    <p>The na­ture of pacts and how it af­fects in­vest­ment de­ci­sions have also changed. The US has al­ready made a ma­jor tax over­haul.</p>
    <p>Many coun­tries are spend­ing more than they are bring­ing in and there is pres­sure for them to col­lect more taxes from MNCs and to pres­sure com­pa­nies to do more in their home coun­tries, rather than over­seas.</p>
    <p>Some coun­tries have uni­lat­er­ally taken mea­sures to tax dig­i­tal ac­tiv­ity and are look­ing to do more.</p>
    <p>They are also as­sert­ing their in­flu­ence through global plat­forms like the OECD (Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and De­vel­op­ment). All these will af­fect com­pa­nies’ in­vest­ment de­ci­sions over­seas, in­clud­ing in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The above cir­cum­stances pro­vide us op­por­tu­ni­ties but also chal­lenges. If we do not adapt quickly, we will be by­passed.</p>
    <p>CHANG­ING NA­TURE OF JOBS</p>
    <p>Third, the na­ture of jobs has changed. Covid-19 has shown com­pa­nies and work­ers that re­mote work­ing is pos­si­ble. Over the years, we have suc­cess­fully cre­ated many jobs here, es­pe­cially PMET (pro­fes­sional, man­ager, ex­ec­u­tive and tech­ni­cian) jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans, by hav­ing many HQs and fac­to­ries lo­cated here. With re­mote work, more global job op­por­tu­ni­ties for our work­ers will come.</p>
    <p>But it also means that other work­ers, in other coun­tries, can do our jobs from their homes. You might have no­ticed that some jobs in the re­gional HQs here are be­ing ad­ver­tised as “can work in Sin­ga­pore” or “can work re­motely”.</p>
    <p>This will af­fect many PMET jobs which can ei­ther be done vir­tu­ally, or through au­to­ma­tion and AI (ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence).</p>
    <p>MORE SO­CI­ETAL FRIC­TIONS</p>
    <p>Fourth, as the eco­nomic pie grows more slowly or con­tracts, it will cause more so­ci­etal fric­tions and ten­sions be­tween those who have more and those with less; be­tween lo­cal and for­eign; and even be­tween Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens and PRs (per­ma­nent res­i­dents). The calls for greater pro­tec­tion and more re­dis­tri­bu­tion can be ex­pected in many so­ci­eties, in­clud­ing ours. We can­not iso­late our­selves from the world. With­out the world as our hin­ter­land and mar­ket, we will re­duce Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic ma­noeu­vring space, and limit rather than ex­pand op­por­tu­ni­ties for our peo­ple.</p>
    <p>We will need to bet­ter take care of those af­fected by job and business losses. We have and we will con­tinue to do these in a sus­tain­able way that is not di­vi­sive, af­firms the dig­nity of work and strength­ens our so­cial fab­ric.</p>
    <p>These ten­sions, un­less well man­aged, can di­vide our so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>This is not the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis or the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis where, if we hun­ker down, things will im­prove in a few months.</p>
    <p>If we wait it out, we will likely be in worse shape than we are now.</p>
    <p>There­fore, we must chart a new di­rec­tion now for a very dif­fer­ent and un­cer­tain fu­ture.</p>
    <p>We do not have all the an­swers yet, and the ground re­al­i­ties are fast evolv­ing, of­ten with­out prece­dence. But we know that stay­ing still is not an op­tion, but we must walk and we will walk this path to­gether. Ev­ery­one must chip in, par­tic­i­pat­ing, in­clud­ing con­tri­bu­tion of ideas and sug­ges­tions, as we move into un­charted wa­ters.</p>
    <p>We must work to­gether with our peo­ple to help them un­der­stand the need for the changes and to im­ple­ment them smoothly.</p>
    <p>In the next few months, we will pro­vide reg­u­lar up­dates on the econ­omy and job sit­u­a­tion, sec­tor by sec­tor. We will in­volve the unions, the em­ploy­ers and the trade as­so­ci­a­tions. We will visit com­pa­nies in var­i­ous sec­tors, work with the unions and as­so­ci­a­tions, dis­cuss with them the changes and chart the way for­ward to­gether to get us through this cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, chal­lenges will not de­fine us. How we re­spond to these chal­lenges to­gether will de­fine us.</p>
    <p>PRIN­CI­PLES TO CHART THE PATH AHEAD</p>
    <p>While the path for­ward is un­clear, we will hold on to three prin­ci­ples as we chart the new path ahead.</p>
    <p>First, we will open for business, safely and sus­tain­ably. It will not be a bi­nary op­tion of open or close. It can be done.</p>
    <p>We must stay open while iso­lat­ing the im­pacted clus­ters quickly and tightly, do­ing it pro­gres­sively and sys­tem­at­i­cally, to know which are the high-risk ar­eas.</p>
    <p>We will learn from the ex­pe­ri­ences of oth­ers and watch their de­vel­op­ments closely. We must learn to man­age the spec­trum of risks from dif­fer­ent ac­tiv­i­ties pro­por­tion­ately, and put in place tighter mea­sures for the higher-risk ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Above all, if each and ev­ery one of us ex­er­cises so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity, we can per­mit more ac­tiv­i­ties to re­open with less risk.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, we will help our busi­nesses and work­ers make sense of and ad­just to the new world. We have three archetypes of firms. The first group of firms are those with op­por­tu­ni­ties, notwith­stand­ing Covid-19 and per­haps be­cause of Covid-19. We will give a boost to help these firms grow be­cause as they grow, they will cre­ate more jobs and op­por­tu­ni­ties for our work­ers.</p>
    <p>Ex­am­ples of these in­clude many in the ICT (in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy), bio­pharma, sup­ply chains and pre­ci­sion en­gi­neer­ing sec­tors. The com­pe­ti­tion for new in­vest­ments has be­come more in­tense. We will con­tinue to cre­ate and pro­vide a con­ducive and at­trac­tive en­vi­ron­ment for new busi­nesses to start up here and for them to plant their in­vest­ments here for the long term.</p>
    <p>We will com­pete for the new in­dus­tries that will en­trench our role in the global value chains. It is not just about mak­ing money now; it is about build­ing re­silient and sus­tain­able sys­tems for the fu­ture, and job creation in the next one/two years will be crit­i­cal be­yond just the value-add cap­tured.</p>
    <p>Jobs pre­serve the dig­nity and liveli­hoods of our work­force, and the con­fi­dence of our in­vestors.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond group of firms are those who are suf­fer­ing a drop in de­mand but will even­tu­ally re­cover.</p>
    <p>We will pre­serve their core ca­pa­bil­i­ties in the mean­time and help them emerge stronger. Help­ing these com­pa­nies with their cash flows, from JSS (Jobs Sup­port Scheme) to rental re­lief schemes, is part of these over­all ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Over time, we should re­di­rect the sup­port to­wards help­ing them gen­er­ate fresh rev­enue and be­come more cost-ef­fi­cient.</p>
    <p>Some F&B com­pa­nies, such as A-One F&B group, built new rev­enue streams in prod­ucts and de­liv­ery, even af­ter din­ing in re­sumed. Some en­rich­ment classes and event com­pa­nies have ex­panded to on­line events and ser­vices, to build new rev­enue streams and to ad­just to the new way com­pa­nies are work­ing.</p>
    <p>The third group of com­pa­nies are those in in­dus­tries that have per­ma­nently changed. This is the most dif­fi­cult part. We will help them rein­vent them­selves, pivot into new mar­kets and new prod­ucts. Some busi­nesses are al­ready act­ing now. They know that the good old days will not re­turn.</p>
    <p>Many of the mass mar­ket tourism, Mice (meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­fer­ences and exhibition­s) and so­cial en­ter­tain­ment com­pa­nies are think­ing and act­ing along these lines al­ready, and we will help them along. We know these are tough de­ci­sions to make but they are nec­es­sary for us to over­come the cri­sis to­gether. The faster we adapt and change, the faster our re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, the slower we adapt and change, oth­ers will over­take us, and the op­por­tu­ni­ties will by­pass us.</p>
    <p>Third, the Gov­ern­ment will fully sup­port our busi­nesses in this process by es­tab­lish­ing the right macro con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>To pre­serve Sin­ga­pore’s abil­ity to com­pete for jobs for our peo­ple, we will strengthen our links to the global mar­kets for sup­plies, tech­nol­ogy and tal­ent.</p>
    <p>Our avi­a­tion and port hub sta­tus can never be taken for granted.</p>
    <p>We will fight to de­fend our net­works and pre­serve our ca­pa­bil­i­ties. We will say more about this in the com­ing weeks.</p>
    <p>Our business and fi­nan­cial hub sta­tus de­pend on strong con­nec­tiv­ity with the world – be it with peo­ple, data, fi­nance or le­gal.</p>
    <p>We will con­tinue to break new ground for the dig­i­tal FTAs (free trade agree­ments) to open up more mar­kets for our busi­nesses while pre­serv­ing ac­cess to con­ven­tional mar­kets through the con­ven­tional FTAs.</p>
    <p>And we will con­tinue to in­vest in our peo­ple and train them for to­mor­row’s jobs.</p>
    <p>And we will strengthen our job match­ing ef­forts.</p>
    <p>In the com­ing months, re­trench­ments will rise, some com­pa­nies will be forced to close, and it will be a dif­fi­cult time for our peo­ple and our busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies must treat work­ers fairly, with dig­nity and re­spect. We will help our peo­ple to take on new jobs with new skills, and we must pre­serve the Sin­ga­pore core for skills and ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>We are in a cri­sis of a gen­er­a­tion. But we are start­ing from a much stronger po­si­tion than the Merdeka Gen­er­a­tion and the Pioneer Gen­er­a­tion. Over the last 55 years, we have built up a strong rep­u­ta­tion of be­ing a trusted place to do business.</p>
    <p>We have de­vel­oped strong net­works and con­nec­tiv­ity with the rest of the world, we abide by the rule of law to give cer­tainty to our in­vestors, we have a highly skilled work­force and we have strong tri­par­tite re­la­tion­ships.</p>
    <p>All these fac­tors will put us in good stead in the com­ing months as we com­pete for in­vest­ments to cre­ate new job op­por­tu­ni­ties for our peo­ple. All our gov­ern­ment agen­cies will work to­gether to make sure ex­ter­nally we pro­vide the best con­di­tions pos­si­ble for our com­pa­nies to do business and re­main con­nected with the world.</p>
    <p>In­ter­nally, we’ll make sure that we pro­vide the strong­est pos­si­ble rea­sons for oth­ers, both lo­cal and for­eign, com­pa­nies to want to in­vest in Sin­ga­pore and cre­ate those jobs for fel­low Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>We will strengthen our ef­forts to help match jobs with our peo­ple and to train them to ac­quire those new jobs with new skills.</p>
    <p>Our prom­ise to all Sin­ga­pore­ans is this: While the fu­ture may be un­cer­tain, while the con­di­tions might be chal­leng­ing, our com­mit­ment to ev­ery Sin­ga­porean re­mains un­changed.</p>
    <p>We will do our ut­most to pre­pare our peo­ple for the chal­lenges ahead, for us not only to sur­vive but to thrive in the new en­vi­ron­ment, and we will not wait for the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion to blow over.</p>
    <p>We will start now, re­fresh­ing our econ­omy and build­ing those new op­por­tu­ni­ties for our peo­ple and the next gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>In the next few months, we will pro­vide reg­u­lar up­dates on the econ­omy and job sit­u­a­tion, sec­tor by sec­tor. We will in­volve the unions, the em­ploy­ers and the trade as­so­ci­a­tions. We will visit com­pa­nies in var­i­ous sec­tors, work with the unions and as­so­ci­a­tions, dis­cuss with them the changes and chart the way for­ward to­gether to get us through this cri­sis. Ul­ti­mately, chal­lenges will not de­fine us. How we re­spond to these chal­lenges to­gether will de­fine us.</p>
