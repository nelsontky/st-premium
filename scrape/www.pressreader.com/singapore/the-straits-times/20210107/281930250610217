    <p>Aus­tralians marked the New Year on Jan 1 with a small but im­por­tant change to their na­tional an­them. Just one word was al­tered, so that the sec­ond line of the song no longer de­scribes Aus­tralia as “young and free”, but as “one and free”.</p>
    <p>Why? Be­cause while the Bri­tish set­tled in the con­ti­nent only 232 years ago, the Abo­rig­i­nal so­ci­ety they en­coun­tered is not young. In fact, it is the world’s old­est liv­ing cul­ture – 60,000 years old.</p>
    <p>The word “young” was dropped to recog­nise this as cen­tral to Aus­tralia’s mod­ern iden­tity.</p>
    <p>It is a small but widely wel­comed step in the long, hard strug­gle to rec­on­cile Aus­tralia’s in­dige­nous peo­ples and the so­ci­ety largely cre­ated by the mil­lions of im­mi­grants who have ar­rived since 1788.</p>
    <p>It was a re­as­sur­ingly pos­i­tive note to New Year cel­e­bra­tions that were dis­rupted by a new wave of Covid-19 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>So far, Aus­tralia has suf­fered less from the pan­demic than many other coun­tries, but Covid-19 has fun­da­men­tally trans­formed the way peo­ple live and work, and will con­tinue to do so. Huge chal­lenges re­main to get the virus un­der con­trol, repair the dam­age to the econ­omy and re­store a sense of nor­mal­ity.</p>
    <p>But that is not go­ing to hap­pen, no mat­ter how well the pan­demic is man­aged, be­cause the year just past has re­vealed sev­eral forces, more for­mi­da­ble than even the Covid-19 virus, that are drag­ging Aus­tralia fur­ther away from the cosy nor­mal­ity it craves.</p>
    <p>For 25 years, since Mr John Howard be­came prime min­is­ter by promis­ing to make them “re­laxed and com­fort­able”, Aus­tralians have been con­tent to let things drift.</p>
    <p>But now, the ur­gent need for ma­jor, and pos­si­bly wrench­ing, change is im­pos­si­ble to ig­nore. That was the great les­son of 2020.</p>
    <p>The great ques­tion of 2021 is whether Aus­tralia can and will meet the chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>BUSH FIRES: A WAKE-UP CALL</p>
    <p>The pan­demic was far from Aus­tralia’s only wake-up call last year. It be­gan with the most cat­a­stroph­i­cally wide­spread bush fires the coun­try has ever seen. Bush fires are al­ways a haz­ard of the Aus­tralian sum­mer, but never be­fore like this. An es­ti­mated 186,000 sq km was burned – that’s more than 250 times the area of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The fed­eral gov­ern­ment in Canberra was slow to recog­nise the se­ri­ous­ness of the cri­sis, as were state gov­ern­ments. De­spite clear warn­ings from re­spected ex­perts months in ad­vance, no one seemed pre­pared to deal with fires on such a scale.</p>
    <p>But the deeper im­pli­ca­tions were even more sober­ing. The scale of the fires was the di­rect re­sult of the longer droughts, drier forests, hotter sum­mers and stronger winds that have re­sulted from global warm­ing. That means that the coun­try can­not af­ford to see the fires as ex­cep­tional. In­deed, it must be pre­pared to face the same kind of catas­tro­phe again and again.</p>
    <p>The fires of­fered Aus­tralians the most com­pelling proof yet of the re­al­ity of cli­mate change. And yet, Aus­tralia’s po­lit­i­cal lead­er­ship has re­fused to see them in those terms. Cli­mate change has been a po­lit­i­cal mine­field, fu­elling the po­lit­i­cal in­sta­bil­ity that has seen five prime min­is­ters in 10 years.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the coun­try has been among the slow­est in the world to re­spond ef­fec­tively to the global cli­mate cri­sis, putting it in­creas­ingly at odds with close friends like Bri­tain and, un­der the new Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion, Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia must find a way to con­trib­ute fully to an ef­fec­tive global re­sponse to cli­mate change if life there is not to face ma­jor dis­rup­tion from fires and drought.</p>
    <p>ECO­NOMIC CHAL­LENGES</p>
    <p>The sec­ond big chal­lenge is to re-imag­ine Aus­tralia’s eco­nomic tra­jec­tory. Un­til last year, Aus­tralia had en­joyed a record long run of un­in­ter­rupted eco­nomic growth, but in­creases in pro­duc­tiv­ity have slowed over re­cent decades. Ma­jor eco­nomic re­forms, on the scale of those im­ple­mented in the 1980s by the Hawke gov­ern­ment, are needed to drive growth.</p>
    <p>But such re­forms are never easy to sell to the elec­torate. They re­quire the kind of po­lit­i­cal lead­er­ship that fig­ures like the late prime min­is­ter Bob Hawke could pro­vide.</p>
    <p>It will be a ma­jor test for the cur­rent gen­er­a­tion of ris­ing politi­cians to em­u­late his achieve­ments. For ex­am­ple, fu­ture pro­duc­tiv­ity growth de­pends crit­i­cally on the qual­ity of Aus­tralia’s ter­tiary ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem – tra­di­tion­ally one of the coun­try’s key com­pet­i­tive strengths.</p>
    <p>But the sec­tor has been plunged into cri­sis af­ter Covid-19 col­lapsed the in­ter­na­tional stu­dent mar­ket that had be­come cen­tral to the fi­nan­cial vi­a­bil­ity of Aus­tralian univer­si­ties. Both short-term fi­nan­cial sup­port and long-term struc­tural re­forms are es­sen­tial if they are to re­cover and flour­ish. So far, none of that is hap­pen­ing.</p>
    <p>And then there is China. For a gen­er­a­tion now, Aus­tralia’s pros­per­ity has been driven by surg­ing Chi­nese de­mand for its ex­ports. As a re­sult, China now pro­vides al­most 50 per cent of Aus­tralia’s ex­port in­come.</p>
    <p>But this lu­cra­tive trade has been hit by a cri­sis that be­gan in 2017 but es­ca­lated sharply last year. Over the past six months, Bei­jing has im­posed lim­its on a wide range of Aus­tralian ex­ports, in­clud­ing wine, seafood, bar­ley, tim­ber, cop­per and coal, and there is real fear that more prod­ucts will be hit over the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>No other mar­kets of­fer any­thing like the op­por­tu­ni­ties that are be­ing lost as a re­sult.</p>
    <p>Su­per­fi­cially, all this seems to be in re­tal­i­a­tion for what Bei­jing sees as un­friendly ac­tions by Canberra, in­clud­ing bans on Chi­nese in­vest­ment, mea­sures to curb al­leged Chi­nese in­ter­fer­ence in Aus­tralian do­mes­tic pol­i­tics, and Canberra’s ef­forts to pin blame on China for the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But the real rea­sons go much deeper.</p>
    <p>China is sig­nalling to Aus­tralia – and many other coun­tries as well – that it can no longer en­joy the eco­nomic ben­e­fits of open ac­cess to China’s huge mar­ket while also sup­port­ing Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>DIF­FI­CULT CHOICE</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia seems to face an ex­traor­di­nar­ily dif­fi­cult choice. If it stands by Amer­ica – its tra­di­tional ally – it faces a col­lapse in its fu­ture eco­nomic prospects. If it aban­dons Amer­ica, it will face China’s ruth­less power with­out a ma­jor ally.</p>
    <p>In truth, the choice is even harder than that. No one can be sure that Amer­ica will re­main the pri­mary power in Asia for much longer, as the new pres­i­dent in Wash­ing­ton comes to un­der­stand how much a con­fronta­tion with China in Asia will cost Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>And if Wash­ing­ton can’t pre­vail over China, then its ca­pac­ity to pro­tect Aus­tralia will dwin­dle any­way, no mat­ter what Aus­tralia de­cides.</p>
    <p>That may be why Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son has al­ready taken a half-step away from Wash­ing­ton, by re­as­sur­ing Bei­jing that Aus­tralia does not share Amer­ica’s view of China as a strate­gic ri­val.</p>
    <p>He hinted at the se­ri­ous­ness of the strate­gic dilem­mas fac­ing Aus­tralia when he said in July last year that Aus­tralia’s sit­u­a­tion was more dan­ger­ous than any it has faced since the late 1930s on the eve of World War II.</p>
    <p>All this con­fronts Aus­tralia with a mo­men­tous chal­lenge. It must re­de­fine it­self and its place in Asia as China’s rise brings the long era of Western dom­i­na­tion in the re­gion to an end.</p>
    <p>For 232 years, Aus­tralians have re­lied on Bri­tain, and then Amer­ica, to keep Asia safe for them. Now, they are in­creas­ingly on their own as they wres­tle with an un­prece­dented com­plex of epi­demi­o­log­i­cal, eco­nomic, en­vi­ron­men­tal and strate­gic prob­lems.</p>
    <p>This new year looms as one of the most dif­fi­cult and de­ci­sive in their long his­tory.</p>
