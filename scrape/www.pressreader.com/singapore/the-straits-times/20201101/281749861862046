    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son will im­pose a new month-long na­tional lock­down in Eng­land un­til Dec 2, ITV’s po­lit­i­cal edi­tor said yes­ter­day, as the coro­n­avirus out­break spreads faster than even the gov­ern­ment’s worst case sce­nario.</p>
    <p>If the lock­down is im­ple­mented, schools and uni­ver­si­ties, as well as es­sen­tial busi­nesses, would be ex­empt from the re­stric­tions, said peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the plan, who asked not to be iden­ti­fied be­cause a fi­nal de­ci­sion has not yet been made.</p>
    <p>It will take ef­fect as soon as Wed­nes­day, said the Times, which first re­ported on the plan.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son is ex­pected to hold a news con­fer­ence to­mor­row to an­nounce the new mea­sures, said the re­port.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic is spread­ing in most parts of Bri­tain, where the of­fi­cial death toll of 46,299 is the high­est in Europe.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment’s sci­en­tific ad­vis­ers are warn­ing Covid-19 in­fec­tions are ris­ing so fast that un­less some­thing can be done to re­duce in­fec­tions, the “rea­son­able worst case” sce­nario of 80,000 dead could be ex­ceeded.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, the gov­ern­ment has a three-tier sys­tem of re­stric­tions for lo­cal ar­eas in Eng­land, with Level 3 the high­est.</p>
    <p>Wales last month adopted a “fire­break lock­down” un­til Nov 9 to try to lower the trans­mis­sion rate, while sci­en­tists and op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers have long been urg­ing Mr John­son to do the same for Eng­land.</p>
    <p>“For the naysay­ers that don’t be­lieve in a sec­ond wave, there is a sec­ond wave,” Pro­fes­sor Calum</p>
    <p>Sem­ple, an ex­pert in out­break medicine at the Uni­ver­sity of Liver­pool, told the BBC.</p>
    <p>“And un­like the first wave, where we had a na­tional lock­down which pro­tected huge swathes of so­ci­ety, this out­break is now run­ning riot across all age groups.”</p>
    <p>To ease pres­sure on the coun­try’s health sys­tem bat­tling the pan­demic, Bri­tain on Fri­day an­nounced it would re­strict the ex­port of flu vac­cines as it em­barks on a mass vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials have warned some hos­pi­tals could soon be­come over­loaded as win­ter ap­proaches.</p>
    <p>Hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions sky­rock­eted in more than a dozen coun­tries in Europe, with ad­mis­sions soar­ing be­yond the peak reached l ast spring in a swathe from Aus­tria to Por­tu­gal. The Czech Repub­lic even re­sorted to de­ploy­ing stu­dents to work at un­der­staffed hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Greece, where a new peak of 1,690 new Covid-19 cases was recorded on Fri­day, said it will ex­pand a night-time cur­few on move­ment and shut restau­rants and bars in the most pop­u­lous ar­eas of the coun­try for one month from Tues­day to con­tain a resur­gence in cases.</p>
