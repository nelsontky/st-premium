    <p>Amid the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, ev­ery­one has to play his part to keep safe. It does not mean just wear­ing a mask, but ev­ery­one prac­tis­ing good clean habits all around.</p>
    <p>I wish to high­light a par­tic­u­lar food­court that has had a habit of not wash­ing the food trays even be­fore Covid-19 was upon us.</p>
    <p>The clean­ers would use the same cloth to clean dirty trays and to wipe the ta­bles, and re­turn those “cleaned” trays to the stalls with­out wash­ing them.</p>
    <p>Imag­ine a tray that held food crumbs, bones and used tis­sue pa­per, but was merely wiped in­stead of washed. These are the same trays that stall­hold­ers use to hold cut vegeta­bles.</p>
    <p>I have brought this to the at­ten­tion of the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency and the Sin­ga­pore Food Agency (SFA).</p>
    <p>The SFA’s re­sponse was that it had “in­spected the said food­court on July 27 but did not de­tect any lapses at the time of in­spec­tion”.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, we have high­lighted this feed­back to the op­er­a­tor and ad­vised them to ask their clean­ing con­trac­tor to use dif­fer­ent coloured cloth for clean­ing food waste and the ta­ble and to sani­tise these cloths regularly,” it added.</p>
    <p>I am ap­palled that the SFA would even sug­gest just us­ing dif­fer­ent cloths to clean trays and ta­bles, and not go the dis­tance and re­quire all trays to be washed. How is this prac­tis­ing good hy­giene?</p>
    <p>Food trays carry food and uten­sils. We carry the trays with our bare hands. Shouldn’t these trays be washed af­ter ev­ery use?</p>
    <p>By the same to­ken, shouldn’t all food­courts also be told to sani­tise all ta­bles af­ter clear­ing them?</p>
    <p>If hawker cen­tres are made to close for thor­ough clean­ing pe­ri­od­i­cally, then should food­courts not be made to do the same?</p>
    <p>How is it that there are dif­fer­ent rules when both serve food? An air-con­di­tioned food­court does not mean a cleaner eat­ing en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>It is one thing to tell Sin­ga­pore­ans to prac­tise good hy­giene, it is an­other thing to not en­force good hy­giene prac­tices in the very places that we pa­tro­n­ise for our meals.</p>
