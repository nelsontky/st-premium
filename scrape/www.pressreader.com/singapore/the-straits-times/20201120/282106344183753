    <p>In 2002, Ms Fa­timah Taha Suhaimi, then an en­rolled nurse, cared for a 21-year-old pa­tient who suf­fered from trauma af­ter a traffic ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the pa­tient was dis­charged, Ms Fa­timah stayed in touch with her and ad­vised her over the phone when she com­plained of gid­di­ness at home.</p>
    <p>It was for such in­stances of metic­u­lous care that the 52-year-old, now a prin­ci­pal en­rolled nurse at Changi General Hospi­tal, re­ceived first prize at the Tan Chin Tuan Nurs­ing Award for En­rolled Nurses yesterday.</p>
    <p>The late Mr Tan Chin Tuan was one of Sin­ga­pore’s pi­o­neer bankers and chair­man of OCBC Bank from 1966 to 1983.</p>
    <p>The an­nual award is the high­est ac­co­lade for en­rolled nurses in Sin­ga­pore. En­rolled nurses – usu­ally the first point of con­tact for pa­tients – have to com­plete a twoyear nurs­ing course, while reg­is­tered nurses have to com­plete a diploma or de­gree in nurs­ing.</p>
    <p>Al­most ev­ery year since 2006, the nurs­ing award is given to 10 en­rolled nurses across pub­lic and pri­vate in­sti­tu­tions, with the top three win­ners usu­ally be­ing prin­ci­pal en­rolled nurses.</p>
    <p>Ms Fa­timah re­ceived $3,500, a spe­cially minted gold medal­lion and a tro­phy. The sec­ond and third prize win­ners re­ceived $3,000 and $2,500 re­spec­tively, along with medal­lions. The re­main­ing seven win­ners re­ceived $800. The cash prizes will go to­wards the nurses’ pro­fes­sional devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>“I feel very grate­ful and hon­oured to re­ceive this award. It is good that en­rolled nurses are en­cour­aged to go for fur­ther stud­ies,” said Ms Fa­timah, a sin­gle mother.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Health Koh Poh Koon, who de­liv­ered a pre-recorded mes­sage to the awardees, said: “I am heart­ened by the ded­i­ca­tion and pro­fes­sion­al­ism of our nurses in over­com­ing chal­lenges to con­tinue to pro­vide qual­ity, safe and pa­tient-cen­tric clin­i­cal care to all pa­tients.”</p>
    <p>Mr Se­bas­tian Tan, di­rec­tor of the</p>
    <p>D. S. Lee Foun­da­tion which founded the award, said the honour is for en­rolled nurses “who have very of­ten not been pub­licly recog­nised for their con­tri­bu­tions to the health­care sec­tor”.</p>
    <p>Prin­ci­pal en­rolled nurses are also tasked to train and guide new en­rolled nurses and nurs­ing stu­dents. Ms Fa­timah said many of the young en­rolled nurses see her as a mother fig­ure.</p>
    <p>An­other prin­ci­pal en­rolled nurse who is of­ten called “mum” is Ms Ow Yong Lai Chan from the In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health. But it is her younger pa­tients who ad­dress her af­fec­tion­ately that way.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond-prize re­cip­i­ent helps pa­tients un­dergo vo­ca­tional train­ing and re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion to re­turn to the com­mu­nity and find em­ploy­ment. The 58-year-old said be­ing the pa­tients’ big­gest fan and al­ways of­fer­ing a lis­ten­ing ear are key to her pa­tients’ re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Third-prize win­ner Yew Xuel­ing, 38, from Sengkang General Hospi­tal, said she in­tends to use the cash to em­bark on more part-time cour­ses in ar­eas such as coun­selling skills and de­men­tia care.</p>
