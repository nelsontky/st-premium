    <p>HONG KONG • The Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties have ar­rested at least 10 peo­ple af­ter in­ter­cept­ing a boat off the coast of the south­ern prov­ince of Guang­dong, the pro­vin­cial Coast Guard Bu­reau said in a post on its so­cial me­dia site.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong me­dia, cit­ing uniden­ti­fied sources, said 12 peo­ple from the city were ar­rested while sail­ing to Tai­wan where they had planned to ap­ply for po­lit­i­cal asy­lum.</p>
    <p>It was not clear what law they would be charged with vi­o­lat­ing but, if con­firmed, it would be a rare in­stance of the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties ar­rest­ing peo­ple from Hong Kong try­ing to leave the city.</p>
    <p>The Guang­dong Coast Guard said on its so­cial me­dia plat­form late on Wed­nes­day that the peo­ple on the boat were ar­rested on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Two of the sus­pects de­tained were sur­named Li and Tang, the coast guard said. It did not pro­vide fur­ther de­tails and could not be reached for comment.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong me­dia iden­ti­fied one of those on the ves­sel as Andy Li, whom they said was re­cently ar­rested un­der a sweep­ing na­tional se­cu­rity law im­posed by Bei­jing on Hong Kong on June 30.</p>
    <p>Mr Chris Tang, the Chi­nese-ruled city’s po­lice chief, said at a press con­fer­ence that he had not re­ceived any in­for­ma­tion from the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties re­gard­ing the ar­rests.</p>
    <p>In Taipei, Tai­wan’s top China pol­icy body – the Main­land Af­fairs Coun­cil – did not con­firm the me­dia re­port, but said those who come to Tai­wan via il­le­gal means will face crim­i­nal charges and re­it­er­ated the gov­ern­ment’s pledges to give hu­man­i­tar­ian as­sis­tance to Hong Kong pro­test­ers.</p>
    <p>The new se­cu­rity leg­is­la­tion, op­posed by many in Hong Kong, pun­ishes what Bei­jing broadly de­fines as sub­ver­sion, se­ces­sion, ter­ror­ism and col­lu­sion with for­eign forces with up to life in prison.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong gov­ern­ment, po­lice and se­cu­rity bu­reau did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a re­quest for comment.</p>
