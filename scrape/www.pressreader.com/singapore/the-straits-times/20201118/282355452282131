    <p>• Daniil Medvedev’s ATP Fi­nals de­but last year proved to be a chas­ten­ing ex­pe­ri­ence as he suf­fered three de­feats but the Rus­sian feels he has grown as a player since then.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, the world No. 4 made his mark with an open­ing win against 2018 cham­pion Alexan­der Zverev of Ger­many.</p>
    <p>His 6-3, 6-4 win put him joint top of the Tokyo 1970 group along­side world No. 1 No­vak Djokovic, who ear­lier trounced Ar­gen­tinian debu­tant Diego Schwartz­man 6-3, 6-2.</p>
    <p>Medvedev will face Djokovic to­day and will take heart from the fact that the Serb also lost all three of his group matches on his de­but in 2007 but re­turned a year later to beat Rus­sia’s Niko­lay Davy­denko to claim the ti­tle in Shang­hai.</p>
    <p>“I ac­tu­ally didn’t know that he (Djokovic) was 0-3 in his first ap­pear­ance,” Medvedev, who also beat Zverev to win the Paris Mas­ters ear­lier this month, told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“I also saw to­day that he’s won 12 con­sec­u­tive open­ing (group) matches at the ATP fi­nals so hope­fully, I can do the same.”</p>
    <p>Djokovic has a 4-2 ad­van­tage in head-to-head clashes with Medvedev but a loss for ei­ther player will not be de­ci­sive.</p>
    <p>Schwartz­man takes on Zverev to­day and another de­feat for ei­ther – their ca­reer meet­ings are tied at two wins apiece – will seal an exit from the sea­son fi­nale.</p>
    <p>Zverev be­lieves he will be head­ing home un­less he can raise his game, say­ing: “Since the restart it was one of my worst matches.”</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, last year’s los­ing fi­nal­ist Do­minic Thiem edged out 20-time Grand Slam cham­pion Rafael Nadal 7-6 (9-7), 7-6 (7-4) for his sec­ond win in the Lon­don 2020 group.</p>
    <p>Day 4: StarHub Ch211, 10pm & to­mor­row, 4am</p>
