    <p>More than 48,000 peo­ple in six Malaysian states were shel­ter­ing in re­lief cen­tres yes­ter­day to es­cape ris­ing flood­wa­ters as mon­soon rain con­tin­ued to lash parts of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of evac­uees has more than dou­bled from the 20,575 re­ported on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Apart from those evac­u­ated in the east coast states of Ke­lan­tan, Tereng­ganu and Pa­hang, and in eastern Jo­hor, sev­eral dozen peo­ple were evac­u­ated from ru­ral ar­eas in Perak and Sabah states, Ber­nama news agency re­ported.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s flood cri­sis, which is into its third month, has sent veg­etable prices soar­ing, with de­liv­ery to Sin­ga­pore af­fected due to the clo­sure of flooded roads.</p>
    <p>Fed­er­a­tion of Malaysian Veg­etable Farm­ers As­so­ci­a­tion pres­i­dent Lim Ser Kwee said prices have risen as the bad weather has af­fected out­put. “There has been no sun for one week, and rain for three to four days. So the veg­eta­bles can’t grow,” Mr Lim told The Straits Times. He said the pro­longed rainy sea­son also caused a drop in sup­ply by around 30 to 40 per cent. The price of chye sim has in­creased from RM3 (S$1) a kg to RM4, while the price of long beans has risen to RM8 a kg from RM4 last month, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Bernard Teh, man­ager of Yong Kah veg­etable farm in Sim­pang Renggam, Jo­hor, which ex­ports 60 to 70 per cent of its pro­duce to Sin­ga­pore, said de­liv­er­ies were af­fected as some roads are closed due to the floods.</p>
    <p>Non-stop heavy rain over the past 72 hours caused his crops to die, with pro­duc­tion over the last one to two weeks drop­ping by more than 50 per cent.</p>
    <p>“The sup­ply is­sue may con­tinue un­til af­ter Chi­nese New Year,” he said, as veg­eta­bles such as beans and cu­cum­bers re­quire 60 to 80 days to ma­ture, while leafy veg­eta­bles will need 20 to 30 days.</p>
    <p>Mr Momy Ket Jik, se­nior sales man­ager at Sin­ga­pore’s Ban Choon</p>
    <p>Mar­ket­ing, said veg­etable sup­ply from Malaysia has been af­fected since last week, caus­ing the com­pany to rely more heav­ily on its other im­port sources.</p>
    <p>Also, floods in some ar­eas have led to a de­crease in quan­tity and in­crease in prices, he said.</p>
    <p>Pa­hang state is the worst hit in the cur­rent rainy sea­son, with 27,073 evac­uees from nine dis­tricts, Ber­nama re­ported.</p>
    <p>In neigh­bour­ing Tereng­ganu state, the num­ber of flood vic­tims to­talled 12,899 yes­ter­day morn­ing. North-east Ke­lan­tan state had 6,319 peo­ple in re­lief cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Jo­hor had 1,276 evac­uees. There were 359 peo­ple in Perak re­lief cen­tres and 35 in Sabah.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Sin­ga­pore Red Cross said it would con­trib­ute $50,000 to sup­port re­lief and re­cov­ery op­er­a­tions by the Malaysian Red Cres­cent So­ci­ety.</p>
