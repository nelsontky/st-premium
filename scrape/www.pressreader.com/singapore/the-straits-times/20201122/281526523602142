    <p>The term Ah Beng is pe­jo­ra­tive, used to de­scribe loud and un­couth young Chi­nese men with ques­tion­able sar­to­rial and cul­tural tastes.</p>
    <p>Many would bris­tle if the la­bel were ap­plied to them. Not Jason Chua and Hung Zhen Long who pro­claim them­selves card-car­ry­ing mem­bers of this fra­ter­nity.</p>
    <p>You can laugh – it doesn’t bother them. The duo are se­cure about who they are.</p>
    <p>Any­way, if your mock­ing taunts get out of line, they are more than ca­pa­ble of beat­ing you to a pulp.</p>
    <p>Zhen Long, 27, is a muay thai ex­po­nent, and Jason – 27 and heav­ily tat­tooed – is a for­mer boxer with the Sin­ga­pore na­tional team who has taken part in nearly 50 fights.</p>
    <p>But they’d prob­a­bly pre­fer to ex­pend their en­ergy on more sat­is­fy­ing pur­suits, like their new restau­rant, Beng Who Cooks, in Tan­jong Pa­gar.</p>
    <p>Opened two weeks ago, it serves dishes with in­trigu­ing names like Crab’s Well (blue swim­mer crab, soya sauce ikura, parme­san chips and tomato soup), Bak Chor Rice (flavoured rice with minced pork and on­sen egg) and Happy End­ing, which on the menu comes with this de­scrip­tion: “Surprise! De­pends on the pas­try chef’s mood lor.”</p>
    <p>It’s a new chap­ter in the sto­ried lives of th­ese two pals. The for­mer hawk­ers, who ran a stall – also named Beng Who Cooks, in Hong Lim Com­plex – be­came Covid-19 heroes when they of­fered free meals, no ques­tions asked, to any­one who needed them dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>What they did earned them a nom­i­na­tion, and then a spe­cial com­men­da­tion, for the Pres­i­dent’s Vol­un­teerism and Phi­lan­thropy Awards 2020 Spe­cial Edi­tion – Our Finest Hour in the City of Good.</p>
    <p>Recog­nised in the “Peo­ple of Good” cat­e­gory, they were in­vited to the Is­tana last month to meet Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Yaa­cob.</p>
    <p>They make quite a pair. Blunt and di­rect to a fault, Jason ob­vi­ously doesn’t suf­fer any fools. Zhen Long is more chill and af­fa­ble.</p>
    <p>Their vo­cab­u­lary may be salty, but both of them are re­minders that ap­pear­ances de­ceive. Th­ese two self-pro­claimed Ah Bengs pos­sess more self-aware­ness, drive and in­tegrity than many of their bet­ter-ed­u­cated and more pol­ished peers.</p>
    <p>This, in part, may have been shaped by their ex­pe­ri­ences, which were not al­ways warm and fuzzy.</p>
    <p>Jason is the younger of two chil­dren of a cou­ple who run a food busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“Since the age of 12, I told my­self: ‘I want to be self-em­ployed, I don’t want to work for any­body.’”</p>
    <p>When he was 15, the for­mer stu­dent of Pung­gol Sec­ondary School had an ex­pe­ri­ence which, he says, left a “mark” in his heart and hard­ened him.</p>
    <p>His mother had kicked him out of the house af­ter dis­cov­er­ing that he had gone to get him­self tat­tooed.</p>
    <p>“When I think back, I guess 15 is ac­tu­ally very young,” says the lanky man, whose en­tire back is the can­vas for a gi­ant skull.</p>
    <p>He high­tailed it to his ma­ter­nal grand­mother’s house, think­ing that he had a cool story to tell his friends. “At that age, your friends are your world,” he says.</p>
    <p>Sadly, de­spite sev­eral calls and one week of wait­ing, not even one of them came to visit him.</p>
    <p>“That’s when I re­alised my friends were not my world. I told my­self: ‘If I get my life back to­gether, if I can sur­vive this, I will make sure that I will de­pend on my­self’,” he says.</p>
    <p>The ex­pe­ri­ence broke but also built him.</p>
    <p>“My friends and part­ners will tell you I never com­plain about hard work be­cause I know in life, you have to do things your­self,” he says.</p>
    <p>It also ex­plains why he loves his grand­mother so much, be­cause she shel­tered him and fed him for a month be­fore he went home.</p>
    <p>Zhen Long, too, went through a for­ma­tive episode dur­ing his teens.</p>
    <p>Can­didly, he lets on that he mixed with the wrong com­pany and was in­volved in some un­savoury ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“There were quite a few things like fights. Then one day, my friends broke into a shop. I was there. I didn’t do any­thing, but I got ar­rested be­cause they were break­ing the law and I didn’t re­port. So quite suay... I was in the wrong place at the wrong time,” he says, us­ing the Hokkien word for un­lucky.</p>
    <p>The for­mer Yio Chu Kang Sec­ondary School stu­dent ended up in a boys’ home, and like Jason, he re­alised that friends could leave you when you needed them most.</p>
    <p>“It was a wake-up call. Your friends are not the ones who visit you or bail you out when you’re in trou­ble. My par­ents and my sis­ter were the ones who vis­ited me, and they would cry. That’s when I told my­self: ‘Eh, wake up lah!’” says Zhen Long, who has an el­der sis­ter.</p>
    <p>His father is a painter, and his mother is a part-time helper in a Ja­panese restau­rant.</p>
    <p>To get rid of his teen angst and ag­gres­sion, he took up muay thai. Through friends who were also into com­bat sports, he met the tat­tooed boxer who is now his busi­ness part­ner.</p>
    <p>Trad­ing fists with an op­po­nent in a squared ring suits Jason’s lone wolf per­son­al­ity.</p>
    <p>Un­like team sports, a boxer is ul­ti­mately re­spon­si­ble for his own tri­umph or de­feat, he says.</p>
    <p>The hap­pi­ness that comes with a vic­tory or the sad­ness with a de­feat is some­thing he doesn’t have to share or ex­plain.</p>
    <p>“When you lose and you’re sad, no one can un­der­stand that sad­ness.”</p>
    <p>Turn­ing in­tro­spec­tive, he says that box­ing was also a cop­ing mech­a­nism, an es­cape from the painful thoughts he har­boured.</p>
    <p>“Per­haps I’m stuck in that time of my life when my friends were my world and my world gave up on me,” he says.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the duo joined hands and be­came busi­ness part­ners two years ago, they tried their hands at a num­ber of things.</p>
    <p>Zhen Long stud­ied elec­tronic en­gi­neer­ing at the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion and, later, psy­chol­ogy in a pri­vate school.</p>
    <p>He worked at nightspots and sev­eral food and bev­er­age (F&B) out­lets, did a stint in re­tail and also sold cars.</p>
    <p>“I hated the job be­cause I had no in­ter­est in cars. But the money at­tracted me. But af­ter a while, life felt stag­nant. I asked my­self if I wanted to do it for the rest of my life, and ac­tu­ally felt de­pressed.”</p>
    <p>In fact, he had a bout of de­pres­sion. Be­cause he was study­ing psy­chol­ogy, he recog­nised the symp­toms and went to see a coun­sel­lor.</p>
    <p>“I was di­ag­nosed with dys­thymia or some­thing like that,” he says, re­fer­ring to the mood dis­or­der that re­sults in – among other symp­toms – dis­turbed sleep, low en­ergy and a sense of hope­less­ness. “Some­times I couldn’t breathe and I’d break out in a cold sweat and break down.” Coun­selling helped.</p>
    <p>Jason, mean­while, stud­ied sports science at Repub­lic Polytech­nic.</p>
    <p>The for­mer com­pet­i­tive boxer har­boured dreams of be­com­ing a per­sonal trainer, but de­cided against it af­ter an in­tern­ship at a gym where he found the cul­ture “toxic and poi­sonous”.</p>
    <p>He had a brief stint as a cargo han­dler, worked at sev­eral F&B out­lets and even­tu­ally took up a culi­nary course at OSAC In­ter­na­tional Col­lege.</p>
    <p>Egged on by the praise of friends who had tasted his cook­ing, he poured his sav­ings into start­ing Beng Who Cooks at Hong Lim Mar­ket and Food Cen­tre two years ago with a cou­ple of part­ners.</p>
    <p>By then, he al­ready had nearly 90 tried and tested recipes.</p>
    <p>Zhen Long came on board about eight months af­ter Beng Who Cooks started, ini­tially to help out. Two months later, af­ter Jason’s orig­i­nal part­ners left, Zhen Long took a stake in the busi­ness.</p>
    <p>They have learnt to work with each other. Hav­ing been friends for more than a decade helps; there’s noth­ing they can­not tell each other.</p>
    <p>Zhen Long, says Jason, has also calmed him down and made him re­alise he doesn’t have to be so hard on him­self.</p>
    <p>Be­cause they are cheeky and friendly, the two quickly be­came a pres­ence at the food cen­tre, where they could, each day, sell up to 70 pro­tein bowls – their spe­cial­ity – pre-Covid-19.</p>
    <p>It helped that Jason also has a strong so­cial me­dia game, with zany, un­fil­tered posts on Face­book and In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>The duo were even ap­proached by Club Rain­bow – a chil­dren’s char­ity with a branch in Hong Lim – to con­duct a con­fi­dence-build­ing work­shop for chil­dren with spe­cial needs.</p>
    <p>Jason and Zhen Long spent seven Satur­days in­ter­act­ing with the chil­dren. Among other ac­tiv­i­ties, they taught their charges how to cook.</p>
    <p>“If you ask me, that is a per­sonal high for me. I have a soft spot for kids be­cause I don’t want them to be­come de­pressed and sad and lonely,” says Jason, who is mar­ried to a kinder­garten teacher.</p>
    <p>The two al­ready had plans to open their own restau­rant be­fore the pan­demic hit.</p>
    <p>“Work­ing in Hong Lim, we saw a lot of old un­cles and aun­ties who have been hawk­ers for more than 40 years. Be­cause they work so hard, many have a lot of (ill­nesses). We de­cided we didn’t want to end up like that. We are young, we want to ex­plore other ways to make money and build a bet­ter fu­ture for our­selves.”</p>
    <p>Zhen Long says: “We felt we couldn’t grow any more, be­cause ev­ery­thing was stag­nant. In life, the scari­est thing is to be stag­nant.”</p>
    <p>Their plan, how­ever, had to be put on hold when Covid-19 struck.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, the two set up a Beng Who Cares Foun­da­tion, giv­ing free meals to those who needed them.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive came about af­ter a friend told them about an old man who had ap­proached him for money to buy food.</p>
    <p>“I wouldn’t call our­selves heroes. Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, we had planned to close be­cause we couldn’t have dine-in, and there were also prob­lems with de­liv­ery. But this re­ally mo­ti­vated us to come down and work,” says Jason, adding that they gave away $15,000 worth of free meals.</p>
    <p>They learnt a few things about hu­man­ity from the episode.</p>
    <p>Zhen Long re­calls peo­ple call­ing up, de­mand­ing to know why the meals couldn’t be de­liv­ered or why there were not more op­tions. But there were also scores who vol­un­teered to fund what they were do­ing. One job­less man was so in­spired by what they did, he went all out to get him­self back on his feet.</p>
    <p>It took them a long time to find the premises for their restau­rant at 39 Neil Road.</p>
    <p>The con­cept?</p>
    <p>“In­no­va­tive cui­sine. We want to ed­u­cate peo­ple about food and tell them that fine food need not be ex­pen­sive,” they say.</p>
    <p>Asked if they are stressed as they’ve poured their life sav­ings into the ven­ture, both say si­mul­ta­ne­ously: “We’re more ex­cited than stressed.”</p>
    <p>Zhen Long says: “I feel like, okay, we are ready to soar, we are ready to fly.”</p>
