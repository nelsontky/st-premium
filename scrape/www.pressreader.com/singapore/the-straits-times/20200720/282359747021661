    <p>BUDAPEST • A mas­ter­ful Lewis Hamil­ton won the Hun­gar­ian Grand Prix in dom­i­nant style and for a record eighth time yes­ter­day to wrest the For­mula One cham­pi­onship lead from Mercedes team­mate Valt­teri Bot­tas.</p>
    <p>Max Ver­stap­pen took sec­ond place for Red Bull, with the Dutch­man win­ning the “Drive of the Day” award de­spite crash­ing on the way to the start­ing grid in early drama that had his me­chan­ics scram­bling to fix the dam­age be­fore the start.</p>
    <p>Bot­tas, now five points be­hind Hamil­ton after three races, fin­ished a close third after bat­tling back from a botched start off the front row.</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton’s 86th ca­reer vic­tory from his 90th pole po­si­tion left the six-time world cham­pion five short of Michael Schu­macher’s all-time record of 91 wins.</p>
    <p>The Bri­ton also equalled Schu­macher’s mark of win­ning a grand prix eight times, some­thing the Ferrari great achieved in France from 1994 to 2006.</p>
    <p>“Round one had mul­ti­ple dif­fer­ent punches that I wasn’t per­haps ready for, but I re­fo­cused and the last two (races) have been fan­tas­tic,” Hamil­ton, who also col­lected a bonus point for the fastest lap yes­ter­day, said of the sea­son so far.</p>
    <p>“This week­end, we’ve just been on point through­out so we need to try and keep this up.”</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old, win­ner of the maiden Steier­mark Grand Prix the week­end be­fore and fourth in the sea­son opener, now has two vic­to­ries for the sea­son and three in a row in Hun­gary, with the next two races on home soil at Sil­ver­stone.</p>
    <p>Like his pre­vi­ous two races, he also “took a knee” and wore a Black Lives Mat­ter T-shirt at the Hun­garor­ing to protest po­lice bru­tal­ity in the US and racial in­jus­tice.</p>
    <p>Equally pleased was Ver­stap­pen, who hailed his team’s me­chan­ics as they won their own race against the clock, giv­ing him a car to drive from sev­enth place on the grid as he al­most had a zero to hero comeback.</p>
    <p>“I thought I was not go­ing to race, so to be sec­ond is like a vic­tory for me,” the 22-year-old Dutch­man said.</p>
    <p>Cana­dian Lance Stroll fin­ished fourth for Racing Point, with Alex Al­bon fifth for Red Bull in an­other turn-up for the team who ap­peared to be strug­gling in qual­i­fi­ca­tion, while Al­pha Tauri’s French driver Pierre Gasly was the only re­tire­ment of the race.</p>
