    <p>Home-grown in­die game de­vel­oper The Gentle­bros cel­e­brated the third an­niver­sary of its ac­tion role-play­ing game se­ries, Cat</p>
    <p>Quest, by re­leas­ing a glow­ing re­port card for it. The five-year-old com­pany, founded by three Sin­ga­pore­ans, an­nounced last Satur­day that it has made more than $5.2 mil­lion in prof­its from over 1.3 mil­lion paid down­loads of Cat Quest games.</p>
    <p>As Sin­ga­pore cel­e­brated its 55th birth­day the past week­end, lo­cal in­die game de­vel­oper The Gentle­bros cel­e­brated the third an­niver­sary of its cutesy, ac­tion role-play­ing game se­ries, Cat Quest, by re­leas­ing a glow­ing re­port card for it.</p>
    <p>The five-year-old home-grown com­pany – founded by three Sin­ga­pore­ans who are for­mer staff of Ja­panese video game com­pany Koei Tecmo – an­nounced last Satur­day that it has made more than $5.2 mil­lion in prof­its from over 1.3 mil­lion paid down­loads of Cat Quest games.</p>
    <p>The co-founders are chief ex­ec­u­tive Des­mond Wong, 32, chief tech­nol­ogy of­fi­cer Leon Ho, 32, and writer/artist Nursyazana Zainal, 30.</p>
    <p>On why the se­ries has been pop­u­lar, Mr Wong says: “Ob­vi­ously, it’s the cats. Ev­ery­one loves cats.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ho adds: “But in all se­ri­ous­ness, we think the Cat Quest se­ries has al­ways walked the bal­ance be­tween ac­ces­si­bil­ity and depth.</p>
    <p>The vi­su­als are bright and colour­ful enough to at­tract kids and ca­sual gamers, but the gameplay is deep and ap­peal­ing for long-time gamers as well.”</p>
    <p>To cel­e­brate the feline fran­chise’s third birth­day, The Gentle­bros has re­leased a free up­date called The Mew World for Cat Quest II.</p>
    <p>Ms Nursyazana says: “Gamers can ex­pect a new mode (for the up­date) called Mew Game, which adds many in­ter­est­ing chal­lenges. There will also be a mul­ti­tude of im­prove­ments to the base game, with new en­e­mies, abil­i­ties, ar­mours and weapons and many qual­ity of life im­prove­ments.”</p>
    <p>Mr Wong adds: “It will truly feel like a whole ‘mew’ world.”</p>
    <p>The co-founders left their jobs in 2015 to cre­ate their own games be­cause they “didn’t want to be just an­other cog in a ma­chine” and felt there was a hole they could fill in the games in­dus­try, Mr Wong says.</p>
    <p>As its name im­plies, Cat Quest ($6.98 for mo­bile; $13 for PC and video game con­soles) in­volves the player tak­ing con­trol of a cute cat swash­buck­ling its way to res­cue its kid­napped sis­ter. Known for its in­ces­sant feline puns, the game is played in a 2D top-down per­spec­tive based in a fic­tional open world called Felin­gard.</p>
    <p>The orig­i­nal game was avail­able on sev­eral plat­forms in­clud­ing PC, An­droid, iOS, Nin­tendo Switch and Sony PS4. But the se­quel, Cat Quest II ($14.50 for PC and con­soles), was launched ex­clu­sively for mo­bile in Ap­ple Ar­cade, the tech gi­ant’s gam­ing sub­scrip­tion ser­vice, in Septem­ber last year. Cat Quest II sub­se­quently be­came avail­able on other plat­forms ex­cept An­droid.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong says: “If you in­clude the sub­scriber num­bers, it is much closer to two mil­lion down­loads. Most of the paid down­loads were split evenly be­tween mo­bile, PC and con­soles.”</p>
    <p>He says Ap­ple helped the in­die out­fit im­mensely with the first game.</p>
    <p>“So when (Ap­ple) learnt that we were de­vel­op­ing Cat Quest II, it reached out to us to see if there was any in­ter­est in putting it on a new gam­ing ser­vice it was work­ing on,” he says.</p>
    <p>He felt it was a great op­por­tu­nity as the re­lease sched­ule of Cat Quest II lined up with the new ser­vice. It was only later that the team re­alised it was Ap­ple Ar­cade.</p>
    <p>The ma­jor im­prove­ment in Cat Quest II is the ad­di­tion of lo­cal co­op­er­a­tive play, which al­lows gamers to in­tro­duce the game to their sig­nif­i­cant other, fam­ily mem­bers or chil­dren with­out the usual bar­rier to en­try seen in other ti­tles.</p>
    <p>There are al­ready plans to make Cat Quest III.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong re­veals that the team in­tends to make nine games for the fran­chise “be­cause cats have nine lives”. But they have no time­line for the third game.</p>
    <p>In­stead, they will be con­cen­trat­ing on mak­ing other games, or spinoffs, in the Cat Quest fran­chise.</p>
    <p>While not giv­ing de­tails about these spin-off games, Mr Wong says: “(This spin-off) will al­low us to try new gen­res of gameplay and fo­cus on char­ac­ters that we would not be able to if we make an­other main Cat Quest game.”</p>
