    <p>An In­done­sian maid who killed an el­derly cou­ple in 2017 claimed she wanted only to run away, and that the dou­ble mur­ders hap­pened dur­ing a scuf­fle.</p>
    <p>Khasanah, who is from Java, said when Mr Chia Ngim Fong started bleed­ing, she pan­icked and used a stool to hit the 79-year-old in the head.</p>
    <p>When his wife con­fronted the maid, Khasanah pushed the 78-year-old onto the floor and stomped on Madam Chin Sek Fah re­peat­edly un­til she went quiet.</p>
    <p>The de­tails were re­vealed yes­ter­day in a coroner’s in­quiry into the deaths of the el­derly cou­ple. The maid was ar­rested in In­done­sia a week af­ter the dou­ble mur­der.</p>
    <p>State Coroner Ka­mala Pon­nam­palam said Khasanah, who was 41 at the time, had de­cided to leave for Batam on June 21, 2017, af­ter spot­ting her pass­port in a cup­board at the cou­ple’s maisonette flat at Block 717, Be­dok Reser­voir Road.</p>
    <p>She had been work­ing for the cou­ple for only about a month.</p>
    <p>But Khasanah, who goes by only one name, told In­done­sian po­lice in the course of their in­ves­ti­ga­tion that she had been un­happy work­ing for the cou­ple. She said she did not like be­ing scolded by Madam Chin.</p>
    <p>In her es­cape plans, Khasanah de­cided she had to re­strain the cou­ple and cover their mouths with duct tape to pre­vent them from stop­ping her.</p>
    <p>When she went into Mr Chia’s bed­room, she found him sleep­ing on a bed.</p>
    <p>State Coroner Ka­mala said: “She went up to Mr Chia, held his hands and pasted the duct tape over his mouth. She started to tie his hands with the raf­fia string. Mr Chia woke up and be­gan to strug­gle.</p>
    <p>“The duct tape cov­er­ing his mouth came loose and he be­gan to scream. Khasanah turned on the tele­vi­sion to drown out his screams. She used her fists to punch him in the face.”</p>
    <p>She then picked up a wooden stool and used it to re­peat­edly hit his head.</p>
    <p>When Madam Chin con­fronted</p>
    <p>Khasanah soon af­ter, the maid pushed her, which caused the el­derly woman to fall on to the floor.</p>
    <p>“Khasanah tied Madam Chin’s hands and legs with the raf­fia string and an­chored the strings to the towel rail­ing in the bath­room.</p>
    <p>“When she saw Madam Chin con­tin­u­ing to strug­gle, Khasanah stepped on Madam Chin’s body sev­eral times while hold­ing on to the bath­room sink, un­til Madam Chin lay mo­tion­less on the floor,” said State Coroner Ka­mala.</p>
    <p>The maid then left the flat af­ter tak­ing her pass­port and some of her vic­tims’ valu­ables.</p>
    <p>Mr Chia and Madam Chin, who were later found tied up and un­con­scious, were pro­nounced dead at around 4pm that same day.</p>
    <p>Mr Chia had suf­fered blunt force trauma to his head, while Madam Chin had suf­fered blunt force trauma to her head and chest.</p>
    <p>In her find­ings yes­ter­day, State Coroner Ka­mala said the in­ci­dent was one of un­law­ful killing per­pe­trated by Khasanah.</p>
    <p>The maid went on trial in In­done­sia between Feb 27, 2018 and May 2, 2018. She was later con­victed of the mur­ders and sen­tenced to life im­pris­on­ment, but it was re­duced to 20 years’ jail on ap­peal.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times vis­ited the cou­ple’s home on Tues­day night. A man who was at the unit po­litely de­clined com­ment when ap­proached. Neigh­bours said the cou­ple have at least one son who con­tin­ues to live in the flat.</p>
    <p>Ms Wahi­dah Haron, a house­wife in her 50s who has lived in the block for more than 20 years, de­scribed the el­derly cou­ple as gen­tle and con­sid­er­ate.</p>
