    <p>Pho­tog­ra­phy en­clave Deck, which is up for de­mo­li­tion next March, has launched a year-long campaign to raise funds to con­struct a permanent space where artists can hone their craft. Made from used ship­ping con­tain­ers, the current space has hosted more than 350 work­shops and ex­hi­bi­tions since it started six years ago. The new two-storey cen­tre will be thrice the size of the old one.</p>
    <p>Take a walk down Prin­sep Street and you might no­tice a stack of ship­ping con­tain­ers nes­tled be­tween two non­de­script build­ings.</p>
    <p>This hip pho­tog­ra­phy space, known as Deck, sailed onto the scene six years ago. Since then, it has or­gan­ised the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Pho­tog­ra­phy Fes­ti­val, as well as more than 350 work­shops and ex­hi­bi­tions with ac­claimed artists such as Robert Zhao, Chou Ching-Hui, Nobuyoshi Araki and Daido Moriyama.</p>
    <p>None of this could have hap­pened with­out help from the com­mu­nity. Years ago, when the area was a plot of empty land, in­di­vid­u­als and com­pa­nies chipped in with money and aid.</p>
    <p>Laud Ar­chi­tects de­signed the build­ing pro bono, with 20 used ship­ping con­tain­ers do­nated by Pa­cific In­ter­na­tional Lines.</p>
    <p>Bok Seng Group helped with lo­gis­tics and con­struc­tion firm Tong Hai Yang spon­sored the toi­lets.</p>
    <p>The lights came from lo­cal elec­tron­ics firm Aztech, and City De­vel­op­ments Lim­ited and Hong Leong Foun­da­tion do­nated cash.</p>
    <p>Most of the sec­ond-floor li­brary’s 4,200 books are from lo­cal and over­seas donors.</p>
    <p>Deck’s co-founders Gwen Lee and Jay Lau – who were part of the team be­hind 2902 Gallery at the now de­funct Old School arts en­clave in Mount Sophia – dug into their own pock­ets as well.</p>
    <p>“When we em­braced this piece of land, there was no elec­tric­ity, no water, no sewage (sys­tem). We had to bring in the elec­tric­ity, the water, and build up the toi­lets, ev­ery­thing, from scratch,” re­calls Lee, 44, who is Deck’s artis­tic di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>To­day, there is a sense of deja vu in the air: An­other ma­jor fund-rais­ing and build­ing project is un­der way.</p>
    <p>In March next year, Deck’s con­tainer struc­ture will be de­mol­ished to make way for a $2.8 mil­lion permanent build­ing of brick, mor­tar and steel.</p>
    <p>The new two-storey cen­tre – to take up 1,400 sq m – will be thrice the size of the old one, with a de­sign that pays homage to its ori­gins.</p>
    <p>Fa­cil­i­ties will in­clude a larger main gallery, a li­brary and re­search cen­tre (in­clud­ing an art stu­dio and read­ing room), and a mul­ti­pur­pose black box that dou­bles as a dark room.</p>
    <p>A me­dia gallery will show­case new me­dia cre­ations such as dig­i­tal sound art, as well as vir­tual-re­al­ity and mov­ing-im­age in­stal­la­tions.</p>
    <p>The build­ing will be ready by late next year, with Lego-style pre­fab­ri­cated con­struc­tion speed­ing up the process.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to build a permanent space came about after Deck – which had held the par­cel of land on a se­ries of two-year leases – man­aged to se­cure a much longer lease.</p>
    <p>Lee says: “A lot of peo­ple might ask, why not check out pos­si­ble spa­ces you can rent from the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil or work with ex­ist­ing in­dus­trial build­ings?”</p>
    <p>But this would mean mov­ing – and they want Deck to sink its roots deep into the neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre’s current lo­ca­tion, after all, is highly strate­gic. It sits be­tween Lasalle Col­lege of the Arts and the Nanyang Acad­emy of Fine Arts, and across the road from Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity’s stu­dent quar­ters.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple recog­nise us as be­ing on Prin­sep Street. We want to build on it, deepen our roots and get peo­ple to know that this or­gan­i­sa­tion is go­ing to grow with them,” says Lee.</p>
    <p>“Per­haps un­der­grad­u­ates from the art schools, when they grad­u­ate, can pitch their works at Deck. Later on, as they grow, they can hold their mid-ca­reer show­cases here.”</p>
    <p>Deck has launched a year-long campaign on Giv­ing.sg to raise $500,000 from the pub­lic. Do­na­tions will be matched dol­lar for dol­lar by the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil’s (NAC) Cul­tural Match­ing Fund.</p>
    <p>Deck’s Ma­jor Com­pany grant from the NAC helps de­fray its pro­gram­ming and man­power ex­penses, but does not sup­port build­ing and in­fras­truc­tural costs.</p>
    <p>There will be other fund-rais­ing events such as work­shops and talks, as well as an auc­tion in Novem­ber. Deck is hop­ing to raise funds from cor­po­rates and foun­da­tions to cover the rest of the $2.8 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Lee adds that space in Sin­ga­pore is of­ten seen as some­thing tem­po­ral. “What does this mean for art spa­ces and for Deck?” she muses.</p>
    <p>She says rent­ing a space un­der the NAC’s Arts Hous­ing Scheme would be shorter-term than they would like and sub­ject to cer­tain con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>“It is very prag­matic think­ing – our re­sources are lim­ited and we have to make sure (spa­ces are ro­tated) to en­sure new gen­er­a­tions of artists have a space to es­tab­lish them­selves.</p>
    <p>“But it also l eaves mid-ca­reer artists and arts or­gan­i­sa­tions in limbo. Per­haps there are other ways that an art space can be built – sus­tain­ably and hav­ing this deep con­nec­tion with the com­mu­nity be­yond the arts coun­cil’s hous­ing or the struc­tures that they have.”</p>
    <p>Pho­tog­ra­pher Kevin WY Lee, 47, who had a solo show at Deck two years ago, says pho­tog­ra­phy as an art form in Sin­ga­pore is “al­most a niche within a niche”.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing a space like Deck is vi­tal, he says – not l east be­cause it pro­vides a space for younger or less es­tab­lished pho­tog­ra­phers who might not fea­ture promi­nently in com­mer­cial gal­leries. “If you look at what Gwen has done, it’s re­ally com­mend­able. She has quite an eclec­tic taste, which is good to have in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Deck’s co-founder reaches for a for­est metaphor when asked what she hopes will change in the arts scene.</p>
    <p>“I hope the com­mu­nity will em­brace (the fact that) the arts and arts spa­ces can grow i n a very or­ganic way with the com­mu­nity at heart, as op­posed to a very highly struc­tured pol­i­cy­mak­ing sys­tem that only em­braces the big in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>“It’s not just (about) the big trees. In an ecosys­tem, low-ly­ing shrubs sup­port a dif­fer­ent species of crea­ture... which sup­port those crea­tures that the big trees need, too.”</p>
