    <p>In times of cri­sis, vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties be­come es­pe­cially ap­par­ent.</p>
    <p>For Sin­ga­pore, the empty su­per­mar­ket shelves dur­ing the early days of the Covid-19 pan­demic were but a symp­tom of a larger worry for a na­tion that im­ports most of its food: food se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>There were at least two pan­icbuy­ing sprees here in the first quar­ter of the year.</p>
    <p>The first was on Feb 7, after Sin­ga­pore announced that it would be rais­ing its dis­ease outbreak re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus situation by a notch to orange, which is just be­low the high­est level of red.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond hap­pened after Malaysia announced a na­tion­wide move­ment control or­der on March 16 to pre­vent fur­ther spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>So­cial me­dia swirled with pho­to­graphs of shop­pers throng­ing su­per­mar­kets, grab­bing mul­ti­ple bags of toi­let pa­per, rice and other es­sen­tials. Re­tail­ers later im­posed pur­chase re­stric­tions, while politi­cians urged calm, ask­ing peo­ple to buy only what they needed.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore im­ports food from more than 170 coun­tries and ju­ris­dic­tions, and has long con­sid­ered di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion a key pil­lar of its food se­cu­rity strat­egy.</p>
    <p>But the pan­demic has shown that di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion alone may be less ef­fec­tive in the face of global sup­ply shocks, when mul­ti­ple sup­ply chains are strained as coun­tries go into lockdown, and food­pro­duc­ing coun­tries ex­port less.</p>
    <p>As Ms Grace Fu, Min­is­ter for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment, said in an in­ter­view with The Straits Times last month, the mo­men­tary panic had al­luded to the pos­si­bil­ity of a global short­age.</p>
    <p>Cli­mate change could have a sim­i­lar im­pact on global food sup­ply, with er­ratic rain­fall and ex­treme weather events af­fect­ing agri­cul­tural out­put.</p>
    <p>But Sin­ga­pore has risen to the chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>Even though many ac­tiv­i­ties ground to a halt over the past year be­cause of the pan­demic, ef­forts to in­crease lo­cal food pro­duc­tion con­tin­ued.</p>
    <p>Take, for in­stance, the goal Sin­ga­pore set last year to pro­duce 30 per cent of its own food by 2030, up from less than 10 per cent to­day. The Govern­ment wants farm­ers to achieve this “30 by 30” tar­get by lev­er­ag­ing tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has not set back this goal, with ef­forts sped up to help lo­cal farms ramp up pro­duc­tion over the next six to 24 months.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, the Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>Food Agency awarded close to $40 mil­lion un­der its 30X30 Ex­press grant to ac­cel­er­ate lo­cal food pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>Nine ur­ban farms were offered fund­ing for their abil­ity to in­cor­po­rate highly pro­duc­tive farm­ing sys­tems that could be con­structed and im­ple­mented quickly to achieve high pro­duc­tion lev­els.</p>
    <p>They in­clude projects such as build­ing ad­di­tional green­houses, lev­er­ag­ing tech­nol­ogy and au­to­ma­tion to re­duce man­power, and bring­ing ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) to high-tech farms.</p>
    <p>SFA said it had to in­crease its orig­i­nal $30 mil­lion bud­get for the grant to close to $40 mil­lion to sup­port the nine com­pa­nies’ pro­pos­als.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, one farm, I.F.F.I, will set up a mega high-tech in­door veg­etable farm that de­pends on AI to mon­i­tor the growth of its leafy greens, along with an ad­vanced en­vi­ron­men­tal control sys­tem to en­sure op­ti­mum yield all year round.</p>
    <p>The farm will also use an in­no­va­tive wa­ter treat­ment sys­tem that re­duces the amount of bac­te­ria in the crops and ex­tends the shelf life of its pro­duce.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is also us­ing sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy to fur­ther rev­o­lu­tionise food pro­duc­tion sys­tems.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, the Re­pub­lic be­came the first coun­try in the world to ap­prove the sale of a cell­cul­tured meat prod­uct, bite-size chicken pieces by California­n start-up Eat Just.</p>
    <p>Cul­tur­ing meat in­volves tak­ing cells from an an­i­mal (of­ten done in a way that is harm­less to the</p>
    <p>an­i­mal), and then grow­ing the cells in a nu­tri­ent broth within a biore­ac­tor.</p>
    <p>Eat Just has said that its cul­tured chicken bites will be man­u­fac­tured in Sin­ga­pore, and its chief ex­ec­u­tive Josh Tet­rick had told The Straits Times that it aims to pro­duce enough not just for the do­mes­tic mar­ket, but also the rest of Asia.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore over­came its lack of nat­u­ral wa­ter re­sources by in­no­vat­ing and com­ing up with solutions like Ne­wa­ter, or re­claimed wa­ter, and de­sali­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Now, it is do­ing the same with food.</p>
    <p>Whether they be high-tech farm­ing meth­ods for eggs, veg­eta­bles or food fish, or cul­ti­vat­ing meat in biore­ac­tors, these Sin­ga­pore-made solutions could be ex­ported to feed other cities as well.</p>
    <p>But in­fra­struc­ture is just one el­e­ment of en­sur­ing food se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the panic buy­ing sprees, some shop­pers loaded their bas­kets with frozen food items, only to aban­don them near the check­out coun­ters when they found the queues too long.</p>
    <p>Kept out of the freezer for too long, many of the per­ish­ables had to be thrown away.</p>
    <p>So just as the empty su­per­mar­ket shelves were a symp­tom of the coun­try’s vul­ner­a­bil­ity to global sup­ply shocks, it also re­flected the na­tion’s food waste prob­lem.</p>
    <p>Food waste is one of the big­gest waste streams in Sin­ga­pore, mak­ing up about half of the av­er­age 1.5kg of waste dis­posed of by each house­hold in Sin­ga­pore daily.</p>
    <p>So while ef­forts are made to boost in­fra­struc­ture for lo­cal pro­duc­tion, mind­sets must change too.</p>
