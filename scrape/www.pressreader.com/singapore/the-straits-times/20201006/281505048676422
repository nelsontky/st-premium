    <p>Safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures to curb the spread of Covid-19 can be fur­ther eased, in­clud­ing the five-per­son limit for so­cial gath­er­ings, if Sin­ga­pore can keep the pan­demic un­der con­trol, said Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He was re­spond­ing to sev­eral MPs on the eas­ing of Covid-19 rules here, as com­mu­nity cases re­main low. The au­thor­i­ties here are be­ing care­ful in re­open­ing Sin­ga­pore, as they have learnt from the ex­pe­ri­ences of other coun­tries, he added.</p>
    <p>De­tails on plans to move to­wards phase three will be pro­vided in the com­ing weeks, he told the House.</p>
    <p>The Dis­ease Out­break Re­sponse Sys­tem Con­di­tion (Dorscon) level will con­tinue to re­main at orange un­til the global sit­u­a­tion im­proves, Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong said in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He was re­spond­ing to a ques­tion from Work­ers’ Party MP Louis Chua Kheng Wee (Sengkang GRC) on whether the Gov­ern­ment would re­view Sin­ga­pore’s Dorscon level, given the sig­nif­i­cant drop in the num­ber of daily lo­cal cases in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>The Dorscon sys­tem is a colour­coded frame­work that pro­vides gen­eral guide­lines on what needs to be done dur­ing a dis­ease sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The Re­pub­lic’s Dorscon level has been at orange since Feb 7, fol­low­ing a rise in un­linked lo­cal Covid-19 cases at the time.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to guide­lines by the Min­istry of Health (MOH), this in­di­cates that the dis­ease is se­vere and spreads eas­ily from per­son to per­son, but has not spread widely in Sin­ga­pore and is be­ing con­tained.</p>
    <p>Mod­er­ate dis­rup­tions to daily life are to be ex­pected at this level, such as tem­per­a­ture screen­ing, quar­an­tine or­ders and vis­i­tor re­stric­tions at hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, Dorscon yel­low – the tier be­low orange – could mean that the dis­ease is se­vere and spreads eas­ily be­tween peo­ple but is oc­cur­ring out­side of Sin­ga­pore, or that it is spread­ing in Sin­ga­pore but is ei­ther mild, or be­ing con­tained.</p>
    <p>Min­i­mal dis­rup­tions are to be ex­pected at this level, such as ad­di­tional mea­sures at the bor­ders and health­care set­tings.</p>
    <p>MOH has said that the Dorscon cat­e­gories are not cast in stone, but are gen­eral guide­lines for ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier in the pan­demic, “orange” mea­sures such as quar­an­tine and tem­per­a­ture screen­ing were im­ple­mented while the Dorscon level was still at yel­low.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has re­cently seen the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity drop to an av­er­age of about less than one to two a week.</p>
    <p>But Mr Gan also pointed out that the Dorscon level is not de­ter­mined by the num­ber of cases alone.</p>
    <p>“At this moment par­tic­u­larly, we have to be very mind­ful that while the num­ber of cases in Sin­ga­pore is low, the cases around us in other parts of the world are still ris­ing. So, there­fore, we can­not let our guard down. I would con­tinue to main­tain Dorscon orange for the time be­ing un­til we’re quite con­fi­dent that the global sit­u­a­tion is un­der con­trol,” he said.</p>
    <p>He noted that Sin­ga­pore is a hub city and needs to open its bor­ders and en­cour­age peo­ple to travel so that its sta­tus as a travel and business hub do not get un­der­mined.</p>
    <p>But he added: “Un­til the world is safe, we will not be safe. There­fore, we have to con­tinue to main­tain the Dorscon level and keep our guard up so that we can con­tinue to keep the num­ber of cases low, es­pe­cially in the com­mu­nity.”</p>
