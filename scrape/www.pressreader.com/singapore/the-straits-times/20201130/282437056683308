    <p>NEW YORK • Na­tional Bas­ket­ball Associatio­n (NBA) play­ers have started to un­dergo daily Covid-19 tests ahead of next month’s start of the 2020-21 sea­son un­der health and safety pro­ce­dures out­lined by the league to teams.</p>
    <p>The guide, un­veiled last Satur­day, de­tails pro­to­cols re­gard­ing the up­com­ing cam­paign, which is set to start on Dec 22.</p>
    <p>Pre-sea­son con­tests will open from Dec 11 and train­ing camps will start this week.</p>
    <p>Last sea­son was com­pleted in a bio-se­cure “bub­ble” in Or­lando af­ter be­ing halted for four months from March by the Covid-19 pan­demic. This sea­son will see 72 games per club which are to be staged at empty home are­nas.</p>
    <p>The league is to an­nounce its up­com­ing sea­son sched­ule in the next few days. In­di­vid­ual work­outs will be vol­un­tary to­day, fol­lowed by re­quired ones from to­mor­row to Satur­day and com­pul­sory group work­outs from Sunday to Dec 10.</p>
    <p>Among the key pro­vi­sions of the pro­to­cols, which men­tion no cri­te­ria that might cause the NBA to sus­pend the sea­son, were a small num­ber of Covid-19 pos­i­tive cases not re­quir­ing a sea­son shut­down.</p>
    <p>Any­one test­ing pos­i­tive can re­turn to work af­ter 10 or more days fol­low­ing the first pos­i­tive test or on­set of symp­toms, or pro­duce two neg­a­tive tests at least 24 hours apart.</p>
    <p>Any player who tests pos­i­tive, even if without symp­toms, must wait 10 days and then be mon­i­tored in solo work­outs for two more days be­fore re­turn­ing to the team.</p>
    <p>An anony­mous tip line will be es­tab­lished to re­port pos­si­ble safety pro­to­col vi­o­la­tions, some­thing that was also used in the “bub­ble”.</p>
    <p>Team travel par­ties will be lim­ited to 45 peo­ple, 17 of them play­ers, as they use are­nas across the na­tion.</p>
