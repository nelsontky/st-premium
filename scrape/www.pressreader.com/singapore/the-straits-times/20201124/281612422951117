    <p>A sin­gle plat­form to re­deem the soon-to-be-dis­trib­uted dig­i­tal tourism vouch­ers would be ideal, but hav­ing op­tions has its draws too, ob­servers say.</p>
    <p>The five on­line book­ing plat­forms ap­pointed by the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) to ad­min­is­ter the redemp­tion of the Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers vouch­ers are court­ing mer­chants and con­sumers ahead of the scheme’s launch on Dec 1.</p>
    <p>Com­pli­men­tary e-vouch­ers, food and bev­er­age cred­its, and exclusive dis­counts are among the perks be­ing dan­gled by Changi Rec­om­mends, Glob­alTix, Trav­eloka, Trip.com and Klook to en­cour­age Sin­ga­pore­ans to spend their $100 vouch­ers on their plat­forms.</p>
    <p>El­i­gi­ble ho­tels, leisure at­trac­tions and tour oper­a­tors can choose to list on as many of the five plat­forms as they wish to tai­lor their own of­fer­ings and bun­dles.</p>
    <p>How­ever, hav­ing too many plat­forms can con­fuse con­sumers, said Dr Kevin Cheong, chair­man of the As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore At­trac­tions.</p>
    <p>“We hope this doesn’t frus­trate the redemp­tion process be­cause ex­pec­ta­tions are high, and it is im­por­tant to de­liver,” he added.</p>
    <p>STB said in re­sponse to queries that “cre­at­ing a uni­fied book­ing plat­form from scratch, or re­quir­ing phys­i­cal coun­ters with ev­ery book­ing part­ner, would not have been prac­ti­cal, timely or cost­ef­fec­tive”.</p>
    <p>Still, some in­dus­try play­ers said that hav­ing dif­fer­ent plat­forms can re­sult in com­pe­ti­tion and more choices for mer­chants.</p>
    <p>Dr Cheong said: “Some may choose to go on all five plat­forms, oth­ers will go with just one. At least there are op­tions.”</p>
    <p>While mer­chants will have to pay a com­mis­sion to the book­ing plat­forms, STB said it helped to se­cure a “much lower range of com­mis­sion rates”.</p>
    <p>The five book­ing plat­forms de­clined to dis­close the com­mis­sion rates they charge to mer­chants par­tic­i­pat­ing in the voucher scheme.</p>
    <p>But busi­nesses on board the plat­forms told The Straits Times that the rates can range from zero to 12 per cent, down from 20 per cent to 25 per cent nor­mally.</p>
    <p>Trip.com said it will be in­vest­ing $2 mil­lion in mar­ket­ing and part­ner­ship ef­forts for the cam­paign, and ex­pe­dit­ing pay­ment to mer­chants to help them with cash flow.</p>
    <p>Glob­alTix, a lo­cal tech­nol­ogy provider that pow­ers the book­ing plat­forms of tourism oper­a­tors such as Gar­dens by the Bay, will launch a ded­i­cated site for its roughly 100 part­ner mer­chants par­tic­i­pat­ing in the voucher scheme.</p>
    <p>Trav­eloka said it is work­ing closely with its more than 200 part­ner mer­chants to cre­ate of­fer­ings that can be show­cased in sec­tions such as “hid­den gems” and “spe­cial pro­mo­tions”.</p>
    <p>Ms Sarah Wan, Klook’s mar­ket­ing di­rec­tor for South-east Asia, said it will kick off with more than 200 mer­chants on its plat­form, in­clud­ing 14 exclusive tie-ups.</p>
    <p>Mer­chants that sell their prod­ucts ex­clu­sively on Klook can ex­pect bet­ter place­ments on its plat­form, Ms Wan said.</p>
    <p>Tour op­er­a­tor Tribe is among those have taken up Klook’s of­fer. “We felt they were the strong­est in terms of mar­ket­ing to lo­cals and could give us dis­pro­por­tion­ate cov­er­age by go­ing exclusive,” said Tribe founder Jason Loe.</p>
    <p>Tribe’s of­fer­ings will in­clude its pop­u­lar es­cape room game/ guided tour hy­brid launched ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Dr Cheong, who is also Sen­tosa 4D Ad­ven­tureLand’s ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor, said the fees charged by the plat­forms are “eq­ui­table”, adding that STB has taken con­cerns about po­ten­tial prof­i­teer­ing se­ri­ously and en­sured trans­ac­tion costs are trans­par­ent.</p>
