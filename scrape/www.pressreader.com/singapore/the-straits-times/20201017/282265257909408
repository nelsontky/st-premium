    <p>MI­LAN • Mul­ti­ple world swim­ming cham­pion Fed­er­ica Pel­le­grini has con­tracted Covid-19, the Ital­ian said in a so­cial me­dia post on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The 32-year-old, who in­tends to take part in her fifth and fi­nal Olympic Games in Tokyo next year, was due to leave for the In­ter­na­tional Swim­ming League (ISL) event in Bu­dapest but felt un­well af­ter train­ing on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“Un­for­tu­nately I have some bad news: Yes­ter­day I stopped train­ing be­cause I felt pain and on the way home I also got a sore throat. So this af­ter­noon I took a swab and I tested pos­i­tive for Covid,” the 200m freestyle world record holder said in an In­sta­gram post. “I was sup­posed to leave on Monday for Bu­dapest to take part in the ISL.</p>
    <p>“I was look­ing for­ward to get­ting back into the wa­ter and fi­nally start­ing a nor­mal sea­son, even more so be­cause I was fine and had trained well. In­stead I have to stop again and in the mean­time I will un­dergo 10 days of quar­an­tine.”</p>
    <p>Pel­le­grini won the 200m freestyle gold medal at the Bei­jing Olympics in 2008 and the world cham­pi­onship in the same event in 2009, 2011, 2017 and 2019, plus the world ti­tle in the 400m freestyle in 2009 and 2011.</p>
    <p>She was not the only Ital­ian world cham­pion to have caught the virus this week – seven-time Mo­toGP world cham­pion Valentino Rossi also said on Thurs­day that he will miss Sun­day’s Grand Prix of Aragon.</p>
    <p>The 41-year-old added he could also miss next week’s Teruel Grand</p>
    <p>Prix at the same cir­cuit in Spain.</p>
    <p>“Un­for­tu­nately, this morn­ing I woke up and I was not feel­ing good. My bones were sore and I had a slight fever, so I im­me­di­ately called the doc­tor who tested me twice,” said Rossi in a state­ment. “The quick PCR (poly­merase chain re­ac­tion) test re­sult was neg­a­tive, just like the test I un­der­went on Tues­day. But the sec­ond one, of which the re­sult was sent to me this af­ter­noon, was un­for­tu­nately pos­i­tive.”</p>
    <p>Rossi, in his fi­nal sea­son with the fac­tory Yamaha team, had en­dured a tough sea­son with three suc­ces­sive crashes, leav­ing “The Doc­tor” down in 13th in the world cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>“I’d like to be op­ti­mistic and con­fi­dent, but I ex­pect the sec­ond round in Aragon to be a ‘no-go’ for me as well,” he added.</p>
    <p>His ab­sence is another set­back for the team, af­ter six of their tech­ni­cal staff missed last week’s race at Le Mans when a mem­ber tested pos­i­tive.</p>
