    <p>It is “rein­vent or die out” as nightlife busi­nesses con­tinue to be shut­tered un­der coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Some clubs, like Zouk, are piv­ot­ing from dance floors to din­ing es­tab­lish­ments.</p>
    <p>But at least a hun­dred oth­ers re­main shut as they do not yet have li­cences that al­low them to op­er­ate as food and bev­er­age (F&B) es­tab­lish­ments.</p>
    <p>The rein­vent-or-die-out mes­sage to still-shut­tered nightlife busi­nesses in Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat’s min­is­te­rial state­ment last Monday was clear, as he noted that such busi­nesses will not be able to open any time soon.</p>
    <p>But he added that the Gov­ern­ment will help them tran­si­tion to other ac­tiv­i­ties or ease their exit, with the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try set to pro­vide more de­tails in the com­ing weeks.</p>
    <p>Zouk was first off the blocks, trans­form­ing its Cap­i­tal lounge in Clarke Quay into pop-up restau­rant Cap­i­tal Kitchen, which has been open for al­most two months, while Ce La Vi’s SkyBar at Ma­rina Bay Sands’ (MBS) is now a fast and ca­sual din­ing con­cept, Bao, which opened ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>Dor­mant clubs like Nine­teen80 in Tan­jong Pa­gar are look­ing at con­vert­ing their busi­nesses to ac­com­mo­date dine-in op­tions.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers, such as Lulu’s Lounge and Bang Bang, both in Pan Pa­cific Sin­ga­pore, are cur­rently in “hi­ber­na­tion mode” un­til re­stric­tions lift, most likely in phase three of the econ­omy’s re­open­ing, as their own­ers fo­cus on the F&B side of their sta­ble of busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>EARLY MOVERS</p>
    <p>Zouk’s Cap­i­tal Kitchen, which saw the Cap­i­tal lounge’s dance floor fit­ted out with 27 diner-friendly ta­bles, has been a suc­cess, at­tract­ing a mix of Zouk reg­u­lars and new pa­trons, mainly young work­ing adults.</p>
    <p>It can seat 135 peo­ple, and serves Asian and Western fare like con­gee and fish and chips, cooked in the kitchen of its ad­join­ing bar con­cept, Red Tail.</p>
    <p>Zouk Group chief ex­ec­u­tive An­drew Li said it started the process of ob­tain­ing a li­cence to run an F&B es­tab­lish­ment “very early on dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod... given the Gov­ern­ment’s clear mes­sage to pivot and adapt”.</p>
    <p>“It took about four to five weeks for the li­cence to be ap­proved,” he said, adding that most of the chal­lenges in trans­form­ing the space were op­er­a­tions-re­lated.</p>
    <p>“Our kitchen pre­dom­i­nantly served bar snacks, but now we have branched into a full restau­rant menu, so in terms of staffing, we also had to up­skill our team to pro­vide the nec­es­sary ser­vice.”</p>
    <p>Zouk de­clined to re­veal the cost of the re­vamp and re­train­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Alexan­der Wong, 30, who goes to Cap­i­tal Kitchen twice a week, said of its ap­peal: “It’s the clos­est thing I can get to a club in this dif­fi­cult pe­riod... we prob­a­bly can’t club in the near fu­ture, so as a club­ber, it’s a sub­sti­tute that re­spects all the safe dis­tanc­ing and gov­ern­ment mea­sures.”</p>
    <p>The bank em­ployee used to fre­quent Cap­i­tal lounge weekly be­fore all mass gath­er­ings were halted in end-March.</p>
    <p>Given Cap­i­tal Kitchen’s suc­cess, Mr Li said Zouk is look­ing into mak­ing it per­ma­nent.</p>
    <p>For clubs that are part of mul­ti­con­cept venues, like Ce La Vi – which com­prises a restau­rant, SkyBar and a club lounge – the dearth of tourists means cater­ing to the lo­cal crowd.</p>
    <p>The SkyBar pa­tio area, which re­opened on Aug 4, is now home to Bao by Ce La Vi, which serves baoburger fu­sion dishes. Mean­while, its restau­rant now hosts Sky High Hawker, which fea­tures a ro­tat­ing line-up of lo­cal guest chefs and hawk­ers each month, who of­fer spe­cial ver­sions of their sig­na­ture dishes from $10 each.</p>
    <p>Ce La Vi’s club lounge, how­ever, re­mains closed. A spokesman said it is work­ing with its land­lord and oth­ers on op­tions for the lounge.</p>
    <p>The ur­gency to adapt and change is not lost on clubs, as re­lief mea­sures and funds dry up, and as re­stric­tions im­posed by the virus drag on.</p>
    <p>The Jobs Sup­port Scheme, which pays part of the wages for lo­cal work­ers, and rental re­liefs have been help­ing to tide clubs over.</p>
    <p>How­ever, rental re­bates have ended and nightlife joints have to con­tinue pay­ing rent for the spaces while de­cid­ing to pivot or exit.</p>
    <p>Nightlife busi­nesses are seek­ing a more ur­gent shot in the arm, es­pe­cially in terms of li­cens­ing. About a third of the Sin­ga­pore Nightlife Busi­ness As­so­ci­a­tion’s 320 mem­bers re­main shut as they do not have li­cences that al­low them to op­er­ate as F&B es­tab­lish­ments.</p>
    <p>Those hop­ing for ex­pe­dited and tem­po­rary li­cence changes in­clude SJS Group, which owns and op­er­ates Bang Bang and Lulu’s Lounge; as well as A Phat Cat Col­lec­tive, which runs Nine­teen80.</p>
    <p>“I un­der­stand some or­gan­i­sa­tions have been in dis­cus­sion with En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore to po­ten­tially make that hap­pen – that is, re-li­cense tem­po­rar­ily to be able to con­vert a bar or pub­lic en­ter­tain­ment space into a restau­rant or bar,” said</p>
    <p>SJS Group man­ag­ing part­ner Sarissa Ro­driguez-Schwartz.</p>
    <p>“For Lulu’s Lounge, it would be great if we could op­er­ate with a 12am li­cence and still have so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures in place.”</p>
    <p>While their clubs are in “hi­ber­na­tion mode”, Ms Ro­driguezSch­wartz said they are ready to open upon a phase-three an­nounce­ment. In the mean­time, SJS is fo­cus­ing on its F&B busi­nesses, which in­clude Pasta Bar and the re­cently opened Bar Mi­lano in Keong Saik Road.</p>
    <p>Nine­teen80 owner A Phat Cat Col­lec­tive is ex­plor­ing ways to in­cor­po­rate din­ing into its retro-themed ar­cade night­club, but recog­nises that it would have to spend on ren­o­va­tions, work on a menu and hire the ap­pro­pri­ate staff.</p>
    <p>The two-year-old club had just dou­bled in size and opened its ex­panded space on March 19 when clubs were man­dated to close on March 25, prior to the cir­cuit breaker. Closed for the last five months, dur­ing which it ven­tured into cock­tail de­liv­ery and selling face masks, it took a 98 per cent hit in busi­ness tak­ings.</p>
    <p>“With our ex­pan­sion, we were plan­ning to fit out a small kitchen for a kiosk – some­where to go for a mid­night snack – but now it has to be a full-ser­vice kitchen,” said Ms Francesca Way, co-founder of A Phat Cat Col­lec­tive.</p>
    <p>Pend­ing clar­ity over its re­quest for li­cence changes and cap­i­tal in­jec­tions from in­vestors, Nine­teen80 hopes to re­open next month.</p>
    <p>LET MORE SPACES RE­OPEN</p>
    <p>That is what reg­u­lar club­bers like 31-year-old Holly Wu are hop­ing for. A fre­quent vis­i­tor to Cap­i­tal Kitchen, she wants other clubs to also ven­ture into trans­form­ing their spaces so she can visit them again.</p>
    <p>“It will be in­ter­est­ing to see how Mar­quee can trans­form... with its three lev­els, it will feel quite grand,” said Ms Wu, who works in the se­cu­rity in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>MBS, which is home to Mar­quee, Sin­ga­pore’s largest night­club, de­clined to com­ment on whether the space will be re­pur­posed.</p>
    <p>Club­ber Ch­eryl Ko, 37, who works in mar­ket­ing, said: “Even if we can’t min­gle, the fa­mil­iar­ity of the space, the lights and video walls and stuff will (be enough to) recre­ate the am­bi­ence of be­ing in a club.”</p>
    <p>For nightlife busi­nesses, how­ever, sur­vival is the top pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>“That’s the whole idea – to sur­vive the sit­u­a­tion, not to make a profit,” said A Phat Cat Col­lec­tive co-founder Joshua Pil­lai.</p>
    <p>“Covid keeps throw­ing us curve­balls, but we have to cross each hur­dle at a time.”</p>

        <p data-role="text">A Sky High Hawker event on Aug 9 at Ce La Vi. The club at Ma&#xAD;rina Bay Sands has rein&#xAD;vented it&#xAD;self to be able to con&#xAD;tinue oper&#xAD;at&#xAD;ing at a time when coro&#xAD;n&#xAD;avirus re&#xAD;stric&#xAD;tions have shut&#xAD;tered nightlife busi&#xAD;nesses. Ce La Vi now has a ca&#xAD;sual din&#xAD;ing con&#xAD;cept called Bao at its SkyBar, while its restau&#xAD;rant hosts Sky High Hawker, a ro&#xAD;tat&#xAD;ing line-up of lo&#xAD;cal guest chefs and hawk&#xAD;ers every month.</p>
