    <p>HONG KONG • Moka Fang, the wife of singer Aaron Kwok, has dis­missed talk that she is part of a “train­ing camp” for women who want to marry su­per­stars, along with Will Pan’s wife.</p>
    <p>The on­line al­le­ga­tions arose af­ter Tai­wanese-Amer­i­can singer Pan, 40, an­nounced last month that he had mar­ried Chi­nese air stew­ardess Luna Xuan, 26.</p>
    <p>Some claimed that Xuan and Fang were part of a group of trainees care­fully coached by a spe­cialised agency to get near to celebri­ties, with the even­tual aim of marrying them.</p>
    <p>Fang, who turned 33 on Wed­nes­day, was asked by a ne­ti­zen on Weibo if the ru­mours were true.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese model did not re­spond di­rectly but posted an art il­lus­tra­tion of an el­derly man look­ing at the rain, with the Chi­nese char­ac­ters for “ru­mours” among the rain­drops.</p>
    <p>It was ac­com­pa­nied by the cap­tion: “Keep calm and don’t fol­low blindly. The ru­mours will col­lapse by them­selves.”</p>
    <p>Kwok, 54, pub­licly ac­knowl­edged Fang as his girl­friend in late 2015, and they mar­ried in 2017. They have two daugh­ters – Chantelle, who turns three next month, and Charlotte, one.</p>
    <p>As for Pan, his agency said last week that he will pur­sue le­gal ac­tion against any­one who con­tin­ues to spread li­bel­lous com­ments about him and his wife.</p>
