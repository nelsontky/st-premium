    <p>Sri Lanka’s par­lia­men­tary elec­tions handed Pres­i­dent Gotabaya Ra­japaksa and his older brother an over­whelm­ing ma­jor­ity, re­sults showed yes­ter­day, giv­ing the fam­ily the power to en­act sweep­ing changes to the Con­sti­tu­tion, a move an­a­lysts say could push the coun­try to­wards au­thor­i­tar­i­an­ism.</p>
    <p>• Sri Lanka’s par­lia­men­tary elec­tions handed Pres­i­dent Gotabaya Ra­japaksa and his older brother an over­whelm­ing ma­jor­ity, fi­nal re­sults showed yes­ter­day, giv­ing the fam­ily the power to en­act sweep­ing changes to the Con­sti­tu­tion of the is­land na­tion.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Ra­japaksa had sought, and achieved, a two-thirds ma­jor­ity for his Sri Lanka Po­du­jana Per­a­muna party and its al­lies to be able to re­store full ex­ec­u­tive pow­ers to the pres­i­dency, a move an­a­lysts say could push the coun­try to­wards au­thor­i­tar­i­an­ism.</p>
    <p>The rul­ing group won 145 seats in Wed­nes­day’s elec­tions and can count on at least five al­lies in the new 225-mem­ber leg­is­la­ture, ac­cord­ing to Elec­tion Com­mis­sion re­sults.</p>
    <p>The two-thirds ma­jor­ity will see Mr Ra­japaksa’s brother and for­mer pres­i­dent Mahinda Ra­japaksa, 74, tak­ing over as prime min­is­ter tomorrow as the tourism-de­pen­dent na­tion strug­gles to re­cover from last year’s deadly Is­lamist mil­i­tant at­tacks and, more re­cently, lock­downs to curb the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The broth­ers’ pop­u­lar­ity has risen among the ma­jor­ity Sin­halese since the 2019 Easter Sun­day at­tacks and be­cause of their record in crush­ing Tamil sep­a­ratist rebels in 2009.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Ra­japaksa, 71, said the restora­tion of full ex­ec­u­tive pow­ers was nec­es­sary to im­ple­ment his agenda to make the coun­try of 21 mil­lion eco­nom­i­cally and mil­i­tar­ily se­cure. No time­line has been set for such a move.</p>
    <p>“We will en­sure (Sri Lanka) will not stand dis­ap­pointed dur­ing our ten­ure,” Mr Mahinda Ra­japaksa said on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, sig­nif­i­cant power is be­stowed on Par­lia­ment and the prime min­is­ter af­ter a pre­vi­ous gov­ern­ment led by the now- op­po­si­tion amended the Con­sti­tu­tion and set up in­de­pen­dent com­mis­sions to over­see the po­lice and the ju­di­ciary, among other arms of the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>“We have seen in the past when gov­ern­ments have had a twothirds ma­jor­ity, (they do) not have to worry about checks and bal­ances,” his­to­rian and po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Jayadeva Uyan­goda said.</p>
    <p>“In fact they have un­tram­melled power, that is what we have ob­served in both In­dia and Sri Lanka. In the past in Sri Lanka, the gov­ern­ments which had this level of power in 1970 and there­after in 1977 gen­er­ated a lot of so­cial dis­con­tent.”</p>
    <p>Vet­eran jour­nal­ist and po­lit­i­cal com­men­ta­tor Vic­tor Ivan an­tic­i­pates a power strug­gle be­tween the broth­ers, who are known for stamp­ing out the Tamil Tigers in­sur­gency for a sep­a­rate home­land for the Hindu mi­nor­ity dur­ing the el­der Ra­japaksa’s pres­i­dency in 2009, end­ing a 25-year civil war.</p>
    <p>“The Pres­i­dent wants to change the Con­sti­tu­tion to take back the power to the pres­i­dency,” Mr Ivan said.</p>
    <p>UN­TRAM­MELLED POWER</p>
    <p>We have seen in the past when gov­ern­ments have had a two-thirds ma­jor­ity, (they do) not have to worry about checks and bal­ances. In fact they have un­tram­melled power, that is what we have ob­served in both</p>
