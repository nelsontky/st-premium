    <p>The web­site op­er­a­tor of on­line travel com­pany Ex­pe­dia Sin­ga­pore – BEX Travel Asia – has ceased its false claims on the va­lid­ity pe­riod of its “Daily Deals” pro­mo­tions and said yes­ter­day that it will not en­gage in fur­ther un­fair prac­tices.</p>
    <p>This comes af­ter a warn­ing yes­ter­day from the Com­pe­ti­tion and Con­sumer Com­mis­sion of Sin­ga­pore (CCCS) that mis­lead­ing con­sumers in such a man­ner con­sti­tutes an un­fair prac­tice in breach of the Con­sumer Pro­tec­tion (Fair Trad­ing) Act (CPFTA).</p>
    <p>The con­sumer watch­dog be­gan in­ves­ti­gat­ing BEX in April last year.</p>
    <p>CCCS found that there were at least 55 “Daily Deals” of­fers on the web­site, which claimed to ex­pire at 11.59pm each day but the prices re­mained the same af­ter mid­night.</p>
    <p>These mis­lead­ing pro­mo­tions in­cluded ho­tel deals and hol­i­day pack­age deals which were of­fered on the Ex­pe­dia Sin­ga­pore web­site and emailed to cus­tomers on BEX’s mail­ing list.</p>
    <p>“Such false claims in re­la­tion to pro­mo­tional prices mis­lead con­sumers into be­liev­ing that there is a price ben­e­fit which is avail­able only for a lim­ited pe­riod, thus cre­at­ing un­war­ranted pres­sure or a sense of ur­gency for con­sumers to make an im­me­di­ate pur­chase,” said CCCS.</p>
    <p>BEX had used such false pro­mo­tional claims since 2016, but took such list­ings down in Oc­to­ber last year while in­ves­ti­ga­tions were on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>BEX said yes­ter­day that it will en­sure that pro­mo­tions on the Ex­pe­dia Sin­ga­pore web­site will not claim to be avail­able for a lim­ited pe­riod if that is not the case.</p>
    <p>Also, it will not claim that pro­mo­tions are valid for a spe­cific pe­riod if they may end be­fore then.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, it said it will com­ply with the CPFTA and take prompt steps to cease any un­fair prac­tices in breach of the Act.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times, an Ex­pe­dia spokesman said the com­pany has worked with the CCCS over the past few months on im­prov­ing how its travel-re­lated in­for­ma­tion is pre­sented to con­sumers.</p>
    <p>“We gave our com­mit­ment to the CCCS on a vol­un­tary ba­sis that we will re­view our in­ter­nal mar­ket­ing pro­cesses to en­sure that we con­tinue to help cus­tomers book travel that meets their re­quire­ments and pro­vide all rel­e­vant in­for­ma­tion that cus­tomers need. The CCCS in turn, has closed its in­ves­ti­ga­tion into BEX Travel Asia,” said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>CCCS said other busi­nesses that en­gage in sim­i­lar un­fair prac­tices</p>
    <p>MIS­LEAD­ING TO CON­SUMERS</p>
    <p>are be­ing mon­i­tored closely. It urged all busi­nesses to re­view their busi­ness prac­tices to com­ply with the CPFTA.</p>
    <p>On Nov 1, the CCCS’ guide­lines on price trans­parency came into ef­fect. They pro­vide more clar­ity on what con­sti­tutes an in­fringe­ment of con­sumer pro­tec­tion laws, and set out the fac­tors and cir­cum­stances that the com­mis­sion may con­sider in as­sess­ing if ad­ver­tised prices and re­lated prac­tices are po­ten­tially mis­lead­ing.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Act, the CCCS is em­pow­ered to in­ves­ti­gate er­rant busi­nesses and file an in­junc­tion ap­pli­ca­tion against them.</p>
    <p>If they do not cease the un­fair prac­tice, the busi­nesses can be charged with con­tempt of court, which car­ries a fine of up to $10,000, or up to a year’s im­pris­on­ment, or both.</p>
    <p>Such false claims in re­la­tion to pro­mo­tional prices mis­lead con­sumers into be­liev­ing that there is a price ben­e­fit which is avail­able only for a lim­ited pe­riod, thus cre­at­ing un­war­ranted pres­sure or a sense of ur­gency for con­sumers to make an im­me­di­ate pur­chase.</p>
