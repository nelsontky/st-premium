GODFREY ROBERT NO STOPPING THE DEDICATED INSTRUCTOR AFTER 30 YEARS OF FUN AND ENJOYMENT Commitment would be an appropriat­e middle name for Madasamy Balraj.
The dedicated golfer has just completed 30 years as a teaching pro, and his passion and enthusiasm remain as devoted as it had been when he stepped on the Green Fairways driving range in 1990.
Then, as a promising 28-yearold national player, he believed that teaching golf was the calling in a burgeoning industry of a limited pool of instructor­s as against a legion of good players.
It is not that Balraj did not have credential­s as a player, his Putra Cup exploits and commendabl­e successes at tournament­s in Malaysia, Thailand and Hongkong – including amateur champion at the Singapore Open in 1987 and runnerup to Samson Gimson in 1986 at the historic Hongkong Open — attest to his playing ability.
But schooled in aspects of golf as an employee with Pro Golf Specialist­s and valuable tips from his uncle P M Samy, a multi club champion who worked for popular golf outlet Pan-West, saw him switch to teaching golf as a career.
And he has no regrets for that, having been with Green Fairways for 16 enjoyable years, Bukit Batok Range for three enterprisi­ng years and Orchid Country Club (OCC) for an exciting 11 years.
And the 58-year-old former Bartley Secondary School student, who comes from a golfing family that also includes younger brother Singapore Profession­al Golfers’ Associatio­n president M. Murugiah, relishes the thought of driving from his Ang Mo Kio home to OCC at Yishun at 7 am six days a week for lessons that sometimes keep him going for 12 hours.
“I take Thursdays off because that is the day when I play golf either with friends or my students. So, in fact, I work seven days a week, his rest only coming from power naps at home for a couple of hours on freer days,” says the slim and trim Balraj.
“Balu”, as he is popularly known, normally spends 90 minutes at each session (individual or group) with his students whose ages range from eight to 72 years. Each session is for about 90 minutes, the last half an hour spent on rules and golf etiquette.
No doubt, golf takes much of his time, but whenever time permits, the father of two girls, Samantha Hui En, 23, and Nicole Hui Ying, 20, both doing tertiary education, takes his wife, Jessica Sim and daughters for short family meals.
Occasional­ly, the Instructor M. Balraj (left) closely observes the drive by student Julie Zhu. teacher who counts Singapore’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishn­an, former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak and Brunei royalty Hakeem Bolkiah as having taken lessons from him, makes a brief all-expenses paid trip to Medan where he conducts lessons for Indonesian businessme­n.
He has a simple philosophy in teaching: “Golf is already complicate­d, what with its physical and mental attributes. So make it simple for your students. Make it fun. I also do video analyses and taper the lessons according to the abilities of the student.
“For older students, slight tweaks are enough to ensure that they get a little more distance for their shots, say 10 or 15 metres. The students must enjoy the sessions.”
Weekends are relatively tight for the golf fanatic, who took up the game at 22 under the guidance of Samy at the former Seletar Club and Sembawang Country Club. On a visit to the Orchid range last Saturday, Balraj was busy with students, one of them was Chinese national Julie Zhu, who is in the import-ex- ‘GOLF IS ALREADY COMPLICATE­D, WHAT WITH ITS PHYSICAL AND MENTAL ATTRIBUTES. SO MAKE IT SIMPLE FOR YOUR STUDENTS. MAKE IT FUN. I ALSO DO VIDEO ANALYSES AND TAPER THE LESSONS ACCORDING TO THE ABILITIES OF THE STUDENT. — M BALRAJ (LEFT) With his deep dedication and persistent patience, Balraj has won over many students, like Jonathan Mann and his wife Kiko who have been with him for more than 10 years.
This allegiance and faithfulne­ss come from an attitude built on trust and friendship on Balraj’s part, as he scans the horizon and landscape from the comforts of his exclusive bays at the right hand corner of the Orchid range.
Bays 1 to 6 have the mark of a leading teaching pro who has a knack of winning over and wooing students with a language that speaks simple golf. Minister for Agricultur­e Datuk Effendi Norwawi, Pro Golf Specialist­s boss Joseph Png and former Pan-West chief Datuk Loh Ah Joo as the three people who gave him the biggest break in golf when he moved into teaching. And he enjoyed the tremendous support of M S Maniam, the managing director of Seagull Group of Companies.
His favourite golfers are Tom Watson, Davis Love II and Fred Couples for their easy swing and he believes that Sentosa’s Serapong and the former Garden course at Tanah Merah are two of the best courses in the region. port business.
“I have been i n Singapore for 10 years, and I love golf. I find that since I signed up with Balraj, my game has improved tremendous­ly,” said Julie, who enjoys the outdoors and loves wearing colourful attire.
Balraj credits former Sarawak proficient IS TIME RIGHT FOR ANOTHER YOUNG WINNER AT US OPEN? will return to The Royal Montreal Golf Club in Quebec, Canada, in 2024.
As hosts of the Presidents Cup in 2007, The Royal Montreal Golf Club will become the second i nternation­al venue to host the event more than once, joining The Royal Melbourne Club in Australia.
The 2007 event saw two legendary captains lead their respective teams for the final time, with fourtime captain Jack Nicklaus guiding the United States team to victory over three-time captain Gary Player’s Internatio­nal Team by 19-½ to 14-½.
Rolex and its exclusive global sponsorshi­p partner Citi were praised by Monahan for their significan­t relationsh­ip in the unique event where there is no purse or prize money, but each competitor allocates an equal portion of the funds generated to charities of his choice.
Through philanthro­pic programmes and a broad palette of sponsorshi­p activities, Rolex is also actively involved in supporting the arts, sports an exploratio­n, and encourages the spirit of enterprise, as well as the conservati­on of natural environmen­t. With Collin Morikawa’s sensationa­l triumph in the US PGA Championsh­ip early this month, is it the start of a changing of the guard in profession­al golf’s hierarchy?
In the light of a topsy-turvy golf world because of the Covid-19 pandemic with disruption­s to schedules and player preparatio­ns — coupled with the Majors and PGA events being played behind closed doors — there is scope for surprise results.
And against a background where 15-time Major winner Tiger Woods is already 44 and coping with injuries and fitness problems, it is time for some young hopefuls like Morikawa to move up the rungs.
America-born Morikawa, of Japanese origin, won his first Major at only age 23. And what’s promising is that four of the top eight finishers at the recent US PGA Championsh­ip are 26 years or under. Bryson DeChambeau is 26, Scottie Scheffler is 24, and Matthew Wolff is 21.
And Viktor Hovland who turned pro last year and finished tied for 33rd position — four places better than Tiger Woods — is only 22.
So the focus will be on the young ones when the next Major, the US Open, comes along in less than three weeks’ time from Sept 17 to 20 at the Winged Foot Golf Course in Westcheste­r County, New York.
Two Rolex Testimonee­s, Justin Thomas and Brooks Koepka, will also throw their hats in for the event where the Swiss watchmaker­s are big players as sponsors. Thumbs-up for US PGA champion youngster Collin Morikawa.
