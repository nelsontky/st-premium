    <p>In a first for res­i­den­tial prop­er­ties in Sin­ga­pore, 191 two-storey ter­raced houses in Gey­lang Lorong 3 that are set to be re­turned to the state upon their lease ex­piry will be de­mol­ished to make way for fu­ture pub­lic hous­ing.</p>
    <p>De­mo­li­tion works are ex­pected to start in the third quar­ter of next year and will be com­pleted by the first quar­ter of 2023, ac­cord­ing to ten­der doc­u­ments seen by The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The 37 fam­i­lies still liv­ing there are ex­pected to hand back their homes to the Sin­ga­pore Land Au­thor­ity (SLA) by the end of this</p>
    <p>year with no com­pen­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>These houses were sold to res­i­dents in 1960 on a 60-year lease which will ex­pire on Dec 31.</p>
    <p>“As a gen­eral pol­icy, lease­hold</p>
    <p>land will re­turn to the state upon lease ex­piry to al­low the land to be re­ju­ve­nated to meet the chang­ing so­cial and eco­nomic needs of Sin­ga­pore­ans,” said SLA, in re­sponse to</p>
    <p>queries from The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>When asked about the fu­ture pub­lic hous­ing plans, the Hous­ing Board said it was un­able to pro­vide more de­tails.</p>
    <p>Of the 37 fam­i­lies still there, 30 have found al­ter­na­tive hous­ing.</p>
    <p>The other seven are “con­sid­er­ing rent­ing an­other prop­erty in the in­terim”, said SLA. “SLA will con­tinue to pro­vide as­sis­tance to the owner-oc­cu­pants with their tran­si­tion to their new homes,” it said.</p>
    <p>Five units have been vol­un­tar­ily re­turned to the state by fam­i­lies who have al­ready moved out.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing 149 units are mainly rented out to for­eign work­ers or for re­li­gious ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>SLA said it worked with the Min­istry of Man­power to con­tact the em­ploy­ers of the for­eign work pass hold­ers to make re­lo­ca­tion ar­range­ments for work­ers who live there.</p>
    <p>Oc­cu­pants who con­duct re­li­gious ac­tiv­i­ties there have been ad­vised to con­sider co-lo­cat­ing with re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions op­er­at­ing in other ar­eas or to rent suit­able spa­ces in com­mer­cial or in­dus­trial premises. Those who need help to re­lo­cate al­tars and deities have been ad­vised to con­tact their re­spec­tive apex re­li­gious groups for as­sis­tance, said SLA.</p>
    <p>In June 2017, SLA an­nounced that the 2ha plot of land would be re­turned to the state with no ex­ten­sions. These homes were built by the Gov­ern­ment for peo­ple dis­placed from at­tap houses in the</p>
    <p>nearby Kam­pung Kuchai that had been de­stroyed in a big fire in the 1950s.</p>
    <p>Re­tired seam­stress Yeo Ai, 79, said her par­ents paid about $4,850 for their unit, which they bought first-hand from the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>This is the first time a res­i­den­tial plot of land in in­de­pen­dent Sin­ga­pore has reached the end of its lease. The 70-year lease­hold pri­vate houses in Jalan Chempaka Kun­ing and Jalan Chempaka Puteh, near Tanah Merah MRT sta­tion, are the next in line to reach ex­piry, in 2034. There are at least two other pri­vate res­i­den­tial ar­eas – Fuy­ong es­tate in Up­per Bukit Timah and homes in Ri­fle Range Road – with less than 40 years left on the lease.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral long-time res­i­dents in Gey­lang Lorong 3 ex­pressed sad­ness at hav­ing to move, but most said they had ex­pected this day.</p>
    <p>Re­tired seam­stress Koh Peck Choon, 76, who in­her­ited her unit from her par­ents and has lived there from the time the house was built, said she has grown ac­cus­tomed to the place but is ready to move out as “the time is up”.</p>
    <p>The es­tate is not as lively as it was in its golden years as many neigh­bours have left, she said.</p>
    <p>Her fond­est mem­ory was of the light­ing of fire crack­ers dur­ing Chi­nese New Year in the 1970s.</p>
    <p>Madam Koh, who never mar­ried, will be mov­ing to a one-room rental flat in Wham­poa within weeks. Un­der HDB’s pub­lic rental scheme, the monthly rent for a one-room flat for first-time ap­pli­cants who earn be­low $800 is be­tween $26 and $33.</p>
    <p>“It’s a lit­tle sayang (pity) to leave be­cause I won’t be able to grow flow­ers out­side my house any more, but there’s no choice. The lease is up and I know we all have to move out even­tu­ally,” she said.</p>
    <p>Her only worry is tak­ing the lift to her sev­enth-floor flat as she has lived on the ground level all her life.</p>
    <p>For Mr Sam Guam, 64, mov­ing out of his unit will mean say­ing good­bye to the 12 chick­ens he has been rear­ing for the past three to four years. Dur­ing the day, the chick­ens roam freely in the grass patch be­hind his home and go back to their coops, just out­side the back door of his unit in the even­ing. He will soon have to give them away to farms and nearby schools as he is not able to take them to his rental HDB flat.</p>
    <p>But Mr Guam, who used to work as a cam­era as­sis­tant, is tak­ing the move in his stride. “In a way, I’m for­tu­nate to be able to live here. Not many Sin­ga­pore­ans can live in a landed prop­erty like this. It’s nice and cheap, but the down­side is that it doesn’t last you a life­time.”</p>
