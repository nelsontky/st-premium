    <p>•</p>
    <p>De­spite en­dur­ing an­other Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) sea­son of dis­ap­point­ment, Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo en­sured all is not lost for the Bucks.</p>
    <p>The for­ward ef­fec­tively pledged to stay at Milwaukee fol­low­ing the top seeds’ 4-1 elim­i­na­tion by the Mi­ami Heat in their Eastern Con­fer­ence semi-fi­nal se­ries with a 103-94 loss on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>It was not the Dis­ney World end­ing the Bucks (56-17) had an­tic­i­pated in Or­lando af­ter fin­ish­ing the reg­u­lar sea­son with the league’s best record for the sec­ond straight year.</p>
    <p>An­te­tok­oun­mpo, who is set to col­lect his sec­ond straight NBA Most Valu­able Player Award in the com­ing days, did not play in Game 5. He sprained his right an­kle in Game 3 and ag­gra­vated the in­jury early in Game 4.</p>
    <p>“The Greek Freak” av­er­aged ca­reer highs of 29.5 points and 13.6 re­bounds per game this sea­son and his team­mates could not com­pen­sate for his ab­sence.</p>
    <p>Khris Mid­dle­ton led the Bucks with 23 points. But the Heat held them to 36.3 per cent shoot­ing, in­clud­ing a third-quar­ter drought that lasted over six min­utes.</p>
    <p>Heat star Jimmy But­ler and Go­ran Dragic scored 17 points apiece while team­mates Jae Crow­der, Bam Ade­bayo, Kelly Olynyk and Tyler Herro also scored in dou­ble fig­ures.</p>
    <p>But­ler, who added 10 re­bounds and six as­sists and was a per­fect eight-for-eight from the foul line, said: “It was tough... Ob­vi­ously they missed their MVP. But we knew we were go­ing to have to get one out of the mud and I think this was the one.”</p>
    <p>Last sea­son, the Bucks lost to even­tual cham­pi­ons Toronto Rap­tors in the con­fer­ence fi­nals, rais­ing ques­tions about An­te­tok­oun­mpo’s fu­ture.</p>
    <p>The 25-year-old could be­come an un­re­stricted free agent af­ter next sea­son if he de­cides against sign­ing a con­tract ex­ten­sion this off-sea­son. But he re­vealed he will not force a trade out of Milwaukee.</p>
    <p>“It’s not hap­pen­ing. That’s not hap­pen­ing,” An­te­tok­oun­mpo told Ya­hoo Sports. “Some see a wall and go in (an­other di­rec­tion). I plough through it. We just have to get bet­ter as a team, in­di­vid­u­ally and get right back at it next sea­son.”</p>
    <p>In the West­ern Con­fer­ence, LeBron James scored a team-high 36 points and be­came the all-time leader in NBA post-sea­son wins as the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers claimed a 112-102 win over the Hous­ton Rock­ets in Game 3 of their semi-fi­nals.</p>
    <p>The Lak­ers take a 2-1 lead into Game 4 of the best-of-seven se­ries to­day. James’ 162nd play-off vic­tory topped the record set by for­mer Laker Derek Fisher.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Milwaukee&#x2019;s Brook Lopez re&#xAD;sort&#xAD;ing to foul&#xAD;ing Jimmy But&#xAD;ler to stop the Mi&#xAD;ami star from an easy bucket. But&#xAD;ler was more suc&#xAD;cess&#xAD;ful on other drives to the bas&#xAD;ket as the Heat dumped the Bucks out of the play-offs.</p>
