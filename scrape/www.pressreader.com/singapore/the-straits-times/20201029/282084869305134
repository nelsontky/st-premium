    <p>The news that Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong have agreed to cre­ate a two-way air travel bub­ble for leisure travel with­out the need for quar­an­tine is much wel­comed (Two-way air travel bub­ble a first for HK and Sin­ga­pore, Oct 16).</p>
    <p>With the year-end school hol­i­days com­ing, it seems that Hong Kong could be the only po­ten­tial over­seas hol­i­day des­ti­na­tion for Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>De­tails of the agree­ment have yet to be re­vealed and would be sub­ject to con­di­tions, in­clud­ing test­ing neg­a­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>I as­sume trav­ellers would have a Covid-19 swab test done be­fore depar­ture, and have another test upon ar­rival at the des­ti­na­tion. So pre­sum­ably, each trav­eller would have a to­tal of four Covid-19 swabs done on the to and fro jour­ney.</p>
    <p>The cost of travel will in­crease but trav­ellers will not have to un­dergo a 14-day quar­an­tine at ei­ther place.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a cir­cu­lar by the Min­istry of Health dated Sept 7, healthcare work­ers who travel over­seas will be sub­jected to a spe­cial quar­an­tine upon re­turn. For 14 days af­ter re­turn­ing from over­seas, healthcare work­ers like doc­tors are not al­lowed to have con­tact with pa­tients.</p>
    <p>So if a doc­tor takes his fam­ily to Hong Kong for a one-week hol­i­day in De­cem­ber, he would have to stay away from pa­tients for another 14 days upon re­turn­ing to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>For salaried doc­tors like those in pub­lic hos­pi­tals, it will be hard to take three con­sec­u­tive weeks off.</p>
    <p>Even for doc­tors in pri­vate prac­tice, the ex­tra two weeks of no-pa­tient con­tact would mean a sub­stan­tial loss of in­come.</p>
    <p>All healthcare work­ers wear per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment at work when com­ing in con­tact with pa­tients. The risk of trans­mis­sion dur­ing a con­sul­ta­tion is neg­li­gi­ble.</p>
    <p>I hope the multi-min­istry task force will al­low healthcare work­ers to travel just like any other Sin­ga­porean.</p>
