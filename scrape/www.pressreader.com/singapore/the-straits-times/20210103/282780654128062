    <p>Eng­land cap­tain Joe Root says any of the play­ers on the forth­com­ing tour of Sri Lanka who feel they are not in the right place men­tally are free to re­turn home.</p>
    <p>The tour­ing party, in­clud­ing for the first time a psy­chol­o­gist, left for the South Asian is­land yes­ter­day and due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic will be in a two-week bub­ble in Ham­ban­tota ahead of the two Tests in Galle.</p>
    <p>The Sri Lanka leg of the tour – they go to In­dia af­ter­wards – was post­poned last March due to the pan­demic and their re­cent visit to South Africa ended pre­ma­turely af­ter a hand­ful of pos­i­tive cases at the team ho­tel.</p>
    <p>Tour­ing and be­ing away from fam­ily for long stretches has taxed play­ers in the past, but the squad have the added pres­sure of liv­ing in a bio-se­cure bub­ble.</p>
    <p>Head coach Chris Sil­ver­wood has for the first time de­cided to bring on the tour a psy­chol­o­gist, James Bick­ley.</p>
    <p>“There’s go­ing to be a lit­tle bit of ex­tra sup­port for the play­ers in terms of a psy­chol­o­gist on the ground at all times mak­ing sure there’s some­one to speak to,” said Root at his pre-tour press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one is very aware that, if at any stage it be­comes too much, they are en­ti­tled to get out and that’s an im­por­tant thing to re­mem­ber.</p>
    <p>“It’s im­por­tant they can say if they don’t feel they’re in the right space phys­i­cally or men­tally to go out and rep­re­sent their coun­try.”</p>
    <p>Root, who turned 30 on Wed­nes­day and joked he is “wait­ing for his hair to fall out”, said his team­mates should not hide away if they are feel­ing blue.</p>
    <p>“As play­ers you have a re­spon­si­bil­ity to speak up, not just use the staff but the other guys around you as well,” he said.</p>
    <p>“As cap­tain that’s a big part of my role to make sure peo­ple are com­fort­able in the en­vi­ron­ment, in a po­si­tion to be at the top of their game and play Test cricket to the best of their abil­ity.</p>
    <p>“It’s a huge part of the role any­way but it’s cer­tainly height­ened more in times like these.”</p>
    <p>He said the play­ers were learn­ing all the time how to op­er­ate un­der the strict re­stric­tions im­posed dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Un­for­tu­nately the last two tours haven’t been able to be ful­filled as we would like but there is more in­for­ma­tion now and each time we go away we learn more,” he said.</p>
    <p>Root added that even if some of the play­ers do test pos­i­tive on tour, they may be able to play on even with­out them.</p>
    <p>“Wher­ever we are go­ing to be we are go­ing to be in con­tact with it in some way shape or form,” he said.</p>
    <p>“If you look around the rest of the world other teams, when they have trav­elled, have had to deal with cases on tour and that might be the case for us. We’ll have to man­age as best we can.”</p>
