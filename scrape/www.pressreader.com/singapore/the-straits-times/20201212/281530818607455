    <p>The in­vis­i­ble labour of run­ning a house­hold is what some ex­perts de­scribe as the men­tal load. Also called “worry work” or cog­ni­tive labour, it is not just about phys­i­cal tasks but also the plan­ning and over­see­ing of those tasks.</p>
    <p>Se­nior po­lit­i­cal cor­re­spon­dent Grace Ho looks at what can be done to ad­dress gen­der im­bal­ances.</p>
    <p>Three years ago, a comic by French car­toon­ist Emma de­picted a scene fa­mil­iar to many women.</p>
    <p>A fraz­zled mother tries to cook and feed her chil­dren at the same time. She ends up burn­ing the din­ner and rages at her hus­band who is re­lax­ing in the liv­ing room. Bewil­dered, he shoots back: “You should have asked! I would have helped.”</p>
    <p>The nub of the prob­lem, ex­plained Emma, is not that women are born to be nag­ging ter­ma­gants, but this: When a man ex­pects his part­ner to ask him to do things, he views her as the man­ager of house­hold chores.</p>
    <p>“Plan­ning and or­gan­is­ing things is al­ready a full-time job. When we ask women to take on this task of or­gan­i­sa­tion and at the same time to ex­e­cute a large por­tion, in the end it rep­re­sents 75 per cent of the work,” she wrote.</p>
    <p>MEN­TAL LOAD</p>
    <p>The in­vis­i­ble labour of run­ning a house­hold is what some ex­perts de­scribe as the men­tal load. Also called “worry work” or cog­ni­tive labour, it is not just about phys­i­cal tasks but also the plan­ning and over­see­ing of those tasks.</p>
    <p>If the air-con­di­tioner has bro­ken down and no one acts on it, and your spouse says, “I don’t know why you’re up­set you had to call the re­pair­man – just ask for help”, guess what? You are the one who had to re­mem­ber or carry the men­tal load.</p>
    <p>Stud­ies have shown that the men­tal load is linked to strains on moth­ers’ well-be­ing and lower re­la­tion­ship sat­is­fac­tion.</p>
    <p>Their ten­dency to shoul­der more house­hold cog­ni­tive labour could also mean choos­ing lower-pay­ing jobs that re­quire fewer hours, or drop­ping out of the work­force.</p>
    <p>A sur­vey of 6,500 em­ploy­ees in 14 coun­tries last year by the Bos­ton Con­sult­ing Group found that women of­ten han­dle time-sen­si­tive daily tasks – for in­stance, leav­ing work on time to make din­ner for the fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Men, on the other hand, take on the less fre­quent tasks, which are not as time-sen­si­tive and more eas­ily out­sourced, such as fi­nances.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese men get more time to fo­cus on their ca­reers – to stay late at the of­fice, meet col­leagues for drinks or din­ner af­ter work, take on stretch as­sign­ments, or travel for busi­ness – and more time to de­com­press from the work­day,” the sur­vey noted.</p>
    <p>The re­sult, ac­cord­ing to the Har­vard Busi­ness Re­view, is that 43 per cent of highly qual­i­fied women with chil­dren are leav­ing ca­reers or tak­ing a ca­reer break. The fi­nan­cial price paid is an 18 per cent de­crease in their earn­ing power on av­er­age, and a 37 per cent de­crease when they are out of the work­force for three years or more.</p>
    <p>What can be done to lighten women’s phys­i­cal as well as men­tal load, both di­rectly and in­di­rectly? Here are a few points to con­sider:</p>
    <p>MAKE SURE EM­PLOY­EES USE THEIR BEN­E­FITS</p>
    <p>Re­searchers Joseph Fuller and Man­jari Ra­man stated in a re­port last year that “by not of­fer­ing ben­e­fits that em­ploy­ees ac­tu­ally want – and by not en­cour­ag­ing em­ploy­ees to use the ben­e­fits they do of­fer – com­pa­nies in­cur mil­lions of dol­lars of hid­den costs due to em­ployee turnover, loss of in­sti­tu­tional knowl­edge, and tem­po­rary hir­ing.”</p>
    <p>If com­pa­nies wish to re­tain their tal­ent – and not just women – they must do more than pay lip ser­vice to such ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>A com­pany may es­pouse work-life bal­ance but hag­gle over peo­ple tak­ing leave, or ex­pect them to stay late ev­ery night. It may ad­vo­cate train­ing, but not give peo­ple time to ac­tu­ally at­tend classes.</p>
    <p>Can more or­gan­i­sa­tions en­sure that ev­ery­one uses up his or her leave each year? Do bosses set a good ex­am­ple by draw­ing clear work-life bound­aries for them­selves?</p>
    <p>OF­FER FLEX­I­BLE WORK AR­RANGE­MENTS</p>
    <p>An­other is­sue is “work­place flex­i­bil­ity bias”, or how em­ploy­ees be­lieve that go­ing off on time or work­ing flex­i­ble hours will hin­der their ca­reer pro­gres­sion. This hurts not just work­ing moth­ers, but also all em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>Greater flex­i­bil­ity can take the form of formal pro­grammes such as flex­i­ble start times, as well as in­for­mal prac­tices such as be­ing able to leave early if a child has a shorter school day or has to visit the doc­tor.</p>
    <p>Re­mote work and on­line meet­ing tools can pro­vide more flex­i­bil­ity for work­ing par­ents. While not ev­ery com­pany can be like Twit­ter, which has al­lowed some staff to work from home per­ma­nently, Covid-19 has de­mol­ished the be­lief that one has to be phys­i­cally present all the time in or­der to be ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>EN­COUR­AGE PATERNITY LEAVE</p>
    <p>Work­ing fa­thers here are en­ti­tled to two weeks of gov­ern­ment-funded paternity leave, and al­lowed to share part of their wives’ ma­ter­nity leave. Yet many seem hes­i­tant to max­imise the use of this leave.</p>
    <p>Num­bers from the Ministry of So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment show the take-up rate for paternity leave was only 35 per cent in 2018, com­pared with 53 per cent in 2017 and 47 per cent in 2016. In those three years, more than 94 per cent of fa­thers did not take up any shared leave.</p>
    <p>Do men here feel that tak­ing such leave will be frowned upon by their em­ploy­ers? Or do they as­sume that women can do a bet­ter job of tak­ing care of young chil­dren? What in­cen­tives can be given so they will proac­tively take parental leave?</p>
    <p>Swe­den, for ex­am­ple, in­tro­duced a “daddy month” in 1995, with 30 days of leave re­served for fa­thers on a use-it-or-lose-it ba­sis. If the fa­ther de­cided not to use that month off work, the cou­ple would lose a month’s paid leave.</p>
    <p>Since 2016, this has in­creased to three months of paid pa­ter­nal leave – re­sult­ing in a wide­spread phe­nom­e­non called “latte dads”, or Swedish men hang­ing out at cafes with their ba­bies in slings.</p>
    <p>DIVVY UP RE­SPON­SI­BIL­I­TIES</p>
    <p>Much ink has been spilt on leg­is­la­tion af­fect­ing women, such as the land­mark Women’s Char­ter of 1961, and more re­cent amend­ments to the Crim­i­nal Pro­ce­dure Code and Ev­i­dence Act, Pe­nal Code, and Pro­tec­tion from Ha­rass­ment (Amend­ment) Act.</p>
    <p>But aside from gov­ern­ment leg­is­la­tion, it is in the pri­vate space of one’s home that gen­der in­equal­ity per­sists. Re­search from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore shows moth­ers here spend twice as much time with their young chil­dren, when com­pared with fa­thers, on week­days. The gap is nar­rowed, but not elim­i­nated, on week­ends.</p>
    <p>A start­ing point could be for cou­ples to in­clude not just phys­i­cal tasks but also cog­ni­tive ones on their house­hold “bal­ance sheet”.</p>
    <p>This is not about men “help­ing” or women “del­e­gat­ing”. Rather, it is an ef­fort to track ac­tual time spent on spe­cific tasks – in­clud­ing plan­ning – and dis­cussing how such tasks can be di­vided eq­ui­tably.</p>
    <p>RE­DUCE UN­CON­SCIOUS BIAS</p>
    <p>Mean­while, in­sti­tu­tions that in­ter­act with par­ents should be mind­ful of the cog­ni­tive labour they im­pose, and seek to min­imise it.</p>
    <p>The late US Supreme Court Jus­tice Ruth Bader Gins­burg, re­spond­ing to a teacher who kept call­ing her – not her hus­band – about their son’s prob­lem be­hav­iour in school, said coolly: “This child has two par­ents. Please al­ter­nate calls. It’s his fa­ther’s turn.”</p>
    <p>The fre­quency of such calls dwin­dled, as the teach­ers had to think harder each time they were go­ing to take a man away from his work.</p>
    <p>And while many com­mer­cials still per­pet­u­ate out­dated gen­der roles, the im­per­a­tive to change is both an eco­nomic and moral one.</p>
    <p>Re­search by Unilever has shown that ads free from stereo­types are 25 per cent more ef­fec­tive, and de­liver bet­ter im­pact for the brands de­picted.</p>
    <p>In In­dia, for ex­am­ple, Proc­ter & Gam­ble launched an ad cam­paign in 2015 called “Share the Load” for its laun­dry de­ter­gent brand Ariel Matic, en­cour­ag­ing dads to help work­ing mums with laun­dry.</p>
    <p>The ads went viral and gen­er­ated a 42 per cent in­crease in brand aware­ness, along with me­dia cov­er­age and con­ver­sa­tions on so­cial me­dia worth an es­ti­mated US$12.3 mil­lion (S$16.5 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>A WHOLE-OF-SO­CI­ETY EF­FORT</p>
    <p>Deep-seated gen­der im­bal­ances are some­thing that the au­thor­i­ties here recog­nise and seek to re­dress.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, Home Affairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam an­nounced that a White Pa­per on women’s is­sues will be un­veiled next year. A se­ries of na­tional con­ver­sa­tions on women’s devel­op­ment is un­der way.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam ac­knowl­edged there are some struc­tural is­sues in Sin­ga­pore that are “prod­ucts of (the) so­cio-cul­tural sys­tem” and have not been dealt with yet.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, he said, women take up more care­giv­ing re­spon­si­bil­i­ties. Work­ing women are of­ten forced to make a choice be­tween work and fam­ily – a dif­fi­cult de­ci­sion that men sel­dom have to con­front.</p>
    <p>“We want women to be pre­sented with real choices, un­en­cum­bered by un­equal ex­pec­ta­tions on the roles of men and women in so­ci­ety,” he said.</p>
    <p>He stressed that th­ese is­sues can­not be dealt with by the Gov­ern­ment alone. “It tells you the role that men play is very im­por­tant in try­ing to have a changed per­spec­tive.”</p>
    <p>In the com­ing years, women – par­tic­u­larly those in the prime of their work­ing lives – may face more pres­sure to drop out, as the de­mands of car­ing for their age­ing par­ents and young chil­dren grow.</p>
    <p>Their part­ners and em­ploy­ers need to step up if they are to re­main pro­duc­tive, which is why th­ese con­ver­sa­tions are im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>As the min­is­ter said, the end re­sult can­not just be a White Pa­per with rec­om­men­da­tions – “it has got to be a clear mes­sage to ev­ery young girl to­day and in the fu­ture, that Sin­ga­pore will al­ways be a place where they can achieve their fullest po­ten­tial”.</p>
    <p>In the com­ing years, women – par­tic­u­larly those in the prime of their work­ing lives – may face more pres­sure to drop out, as the de­mands of car­ing for their age­ing par­ents and young chil­dren grow. Their part­ners and em­ploy­ers need to step up if they are to re­main pro­duc­tive, which is why th­ese con­ver­sa­tions are im­por­tant.</p>
