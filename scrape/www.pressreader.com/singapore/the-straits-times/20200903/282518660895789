    <p>Hey you! Are you dis­re­spected and pow­er­less? Do you feel op­pressed? Why do some guys have it all – money, re­la­tion­ships, ca­reer – while you strug­gle?</p>
    <p>This week’s films might give you an­swers. From Poland comes the team of di­rec­tor Jan Ko­masa and screen­writer Ma­teusz Pacewicz, who peer into the hearts of so­ci­ety’s sec­ond-raters, the wannabes and the losers.</p>
    <p>Two re­cent projects of theirs – a drama and a thriller – show­case their abil­ity to craft young male char­ac­ters too creepy to like. Then be­fore you know it, they have crept un­der your skin and be­come a lit­tle heroic.</p>
    <p>In the psy­cho­log­i­cal thriller</p>
    <p>The Hater (R21, 136 min­utes, Net­flix, ), Ma­ciej Mu­sialowski is To­masz, or “Tomek” to his friends. The law stu­dent is the clas­sic hov­er­ing guy, or in chat fo­rum par­lance, the “beta or­biter”, a de-mas­culin­is­ing term that be­comes more rel­e­vant as the story pro­gresses.</p>
    <p>The lad from the prov­inces be­comes a drab satel­lite of the sparkling Kra­sucki fam­ily. He takes a spe­cial in­ter­est in the gor­geous daugh­ter, Gabi (Vanessa Alek­sander). The lib­eral elites and mem­bers of the “woke rich” pity</p>
    <p>Tomek, but qui­etly sneer at him. They hap­pily ac­cept his labour when he is re­cruited into their cause, yet shud­der at the thought of see­ing him as an equal.</p>
    <p>What hap­pens next is a grip­ping tale of re­venge set in the cul­ture of the right-wingers who in­fest gam­ing com­mu­ni­ties, the ones who wail about man­hoods tram­pled by fem­i­nists and a proud white race erased by non-white im­mi­grants.</p>
    <p>Through Tomek’s malev­o­lent eyes, we see a Europe torn apart by care­fully scripted so­cial media smears, made vi­ral by bot farms in In­dia that are cre­ated to weaponise Red­dit, 4Chan and Face­book con­spir­acy the­o­rists.</p>
    <p>Ko­masa and Pacewicz cre­ate an ironic bleak­ness that of­ten feels like them be­ing edgy for its own sake, but by never los­ing sight of Tomek’s hunger and hu­man­ity, this tragedy feels grounded in truth.</p>
    <p>In the drama Cor­pus Christi (R21, 115 min­utes, now show­ing at se­lected Golden Vil­lage cin­e­mas and The Pro­jec­tor, ),</p>
    <p>Ko­masa and Pacewicz take an­other alien­ated young man and weave his story into that of Poland’s Catholic cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Daniel, played by Bar­tosz Bie­le­nia, is sly, vi­o­lent and pos­si­bly psy­cho­pathic. The in­mate of a ju­ve­nile de­ten­tion cen­tre has an epiphany. In Catholic par­lance, he has heard the call.</p>
    <p>His crim­i­nal past, how­ever, bars him from the sem­i­nary. Then, an open­ing presents it­self and the nat­u­ral-born trick­ster grabs it. The street punk is now a vil­lage priest, a pow­er­ful fig­ure who hears con­fes­sions and gives com­fort to the dy­ing.</p>
    <p>Poland’s en­try into the Best In­ter­na­tional Fea­ture cat­e­gory of</p>
    <p>The Hater stars Ma­ciej Mu­sialowski and Vanessa Alek­sander (both left). this year’s Academy Awards made it into the fi­nal shortlist. It of­fers a por­trait of a spir­i­tual faker that never goes for the ob­vi­ous shots.</p>
    <p>In the tra­di­tion of comic satire, one might ex­pect the con­man to ex­pose the foibles of the Church and the gulli­bil­ity of the lo­cal yokels. There is some of that, but this movie – re­leased as part of the Pol­ish Film Fes­ti­val hosted by The Pro­jec­tor this month – avoids the smug re­li­gion-is-a-scam per­spec­tive.</p>
    <p>Daniel gets what he wants – a pul­pit from which to blast his rad­i­cal take on the cat­e­chism – but faces the grim re­al­ity of the vil­lage priest’s life, an ex­is­tence that can be marked by drudgery, de­pres­sion and, worst of all, lone­li­ness.</p>
    <p>In the hands of Ko­masa and Pacewicz, Daniel is a crea­ture of in­stinct and as such, can be frus­trat­ingly con­tra­dic­tory – an­i­mal­is­tic yet God-fear­ing, vi­o­lent yet em­pa­thetic – but the jour­ney of the bo­gan who be­comes a bo­gus cleric is never not in­ter­est­ing.</p>
    <p>Other films open­ing this week but not re­viewed in­clude the Dis­ney pe­riod fan­tasy drama Mu­lan (PG13, 115 min­utes, opens to­mor­row), a live-ac­tion ver­sion of the much-loved 1998 an­i­mated fea­ture. It stars Liu Yifei, Don­nie Yen, Gong Li and Jet Li, and will be re­viewed in The Straits Times this week af­ter the re­view em­bargo is lifted.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese ro­mance fan­tasy Love You For­ever (PG, 115 min­utes, now show­ing at Golden Vil­lage cin­e­mas) tells the story of child­hood sweet­hearts, Lin Ge (Lee Hongchi) and Qiu Qian (Li Yi­tong), whose love can­not be de­feated by death.</p>
