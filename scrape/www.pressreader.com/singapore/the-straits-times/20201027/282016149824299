    <p>How to get more from my monthly CPF pay­outs af­ter retirement? Should I sign up for CPF Life? Here are the an­swers to some of your ques­tions on grow­ing your sav­ings in your golden years</p>
    <p>Where will my monthly pay­outs in retirement come from: CPF Life or the Retirement Sum Scheme?</p>
    <p>It de­pends on whether you are on the Retirement Sum Scheme (RSS) or CPF Life, a na­tional longevity in­sur­ance an­nu­ity scheme. RSS mem­bers will re­ceive monthly pay­outs from their Retirement Ac­count (R A) un­til their sav­ings are de­pleted, whereas CPF Life mem­bers will re­ceive monthly pay­outs for as long as they live.</p>
    <p>If you were born be­fore 1958, you will be on RSS. If you were born from 1958 on­wards and have the fol­low­ing R A bal­ances, you will join CPF Life: If you are not on CPF Life, you can ap­ply to join any­time be­fore you turn 80 by fol­low­ing the steps be­low: Log in to my cpf On­line Ser­vices with your SingPass Click on My Re­quests and ap­ply for CPF Life</p>
    <p>How much do I get in CPF Life monthly pay­outs when I re­tire?</p>
    <p>Your monthly pay­outs would de­pend mostly on the amount of pre­mium that you paid with your CPF retirement sav­ings to join CPF Life.</p>
    <p>The amount you re­ceive in monthly pay­outs gen­er­ally in­creases if you set aside more in your R A . For ex­am­ple, if you turn 55 in 2020, these will be your es­ti­mated CPF Life pay­outs, based on the R A sav­ings you have set aside at this age and the CPF Life pre­mium you even­tu­ally pay at age 65. ^Pro­jected amount at age 65 based on cor­re­spond­ing RA sav­ings set aside at age 55</p>
    <p>*Es­ti­mates are based on CPF Life Stan­dard Plan as of 2020</p>
    <p>To in­crease your monthly pay­outs, you can also con­sider top­ping up your R A or de­fer­ring the start of your pay­outs.</p>
    <p>Use the CPF Life Es­ti­ma­tor to find out how much you need in your RA to re­ceive your de­sired monthly pay­outs or how much you could re­ceive monthly un­der the dif­fer­ent CPF Life plans.</p>
    <p>Does my CPF Life pre­mium con­tinue to earn in­ter­est af­ter I start my pay­outs?</p>
    <p>Yes, you will con­tinue to earn in­ter­est on your CPF Life pre­mium. As a re­sult, you will see a higher monthly pay­out. As with any other an­nu­ity prod­uct, in­ter­est earned on the pre­mium is ac­cu­mu­lated and shared to al­low you and other CPF Life mem­bers to con­tinue re­ceiv­ing life­long monthly pay­outs even af­ter your CPF Life pre­mium is de­pleted.</p>
    <p>I am now 57 years old and have met the Full Retirement Sum in my Retirement Ac­count. Can I trans­fer some of my money from the Or­di­nary Ac­count to Spe­cial Ac­count as it earns a higher in­ter­est?</p>
    <p>When you turned 55 years old, your R A was cre­ated us­ing sav­ings from your Spe­cial and Or­di­nary Ac­counts to form your retirement sum.</p>
    <p>Hence, top-ups — whether in cash or through CPF trans­fers — to the Spe­cial Ac­count are no longer ap­pli­ca­ble af­ter you turn 55 years old.</p>
    <p>If you would like to en­hance your retirement sav­ings, you can top up your R A with your Spe­cial and Or­di­nary Ac­count sav­ings. The max­i­mum amount you can trans­fer is capped at the En­hanced Retirement Sum for the year.</p>
    <p>Q: Should I leave my sav­ings in my CPF ac­count or invest them?</p>
    <p>The CPF In­vest­ment Scheme (CPFIS) is for those who have both the knowl­edge and the time to invest and are pre­pared to take the risks. You can try the CPFIS Self-Aware­ness Ques­tion­naire on cpf.gov.sg to help gauge your readi­ness to invest your CPF money.</p>
    <p>The CPFIS gives you the op­tion of in­vest­ing part of your CPF sav­ings in var­i­ous in­stru­ments, such as in­sur­ance prod­ucts, unit trusts, bonds and shares, to di­ver­sify and po­ten­tially grow your retirement nest egg. How­ever, all in­vest­ments come with risks and you may lose some or the en­tire amount in­vested.</p>
    <p>If you are not con­fi­dent of in­vest­ing on your own, you may con­sider leav­ing your money in your CPF ac­counts that earn risk-free in­ter­est of up to 5 per cent per an­num for those be­low the age of 55, and up to 6 per cent per an­num for those 55 years old and older.</p>
    <p>What hap­pens to my CPF sav­ings af­ter I die?</p>
    <p>Af­ter you die, your CPF sav­ings, by de­fault, will be distribute­d to your ben­e­fi­cia­ries in cash.</p>
    <p>If you made a CPF nom­i­na­tion, your CPF sav­ings will be distribute­d to your nom­i­nees. Oth­er­wise, it will be trans­ferred to the Pub­lic Trustee’s Of­fice to be distribute­d in cash to fam­ily mem­bers ac­cord­ing to Sin­ga­pore’s in­tes­tacy laws or Mus­lim in­her­i­tance laws.</p>
