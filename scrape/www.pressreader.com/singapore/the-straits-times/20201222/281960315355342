    <p>When Covid-19 first hit Europe in Fe­bru­ary, Dr An­gela Merkel, a physi­cist by ed­u­ca­tion, quickly un­der­stood the per­ils a pan­demic with ex­po­nen­tial growth could bring.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man Chan­cel­lor man­aged to swiftly get the heads of the 16 Ger­man states on board, and by March, a se­vere lock­down was al­ready in place. The spread of the virus seemed to be un­der con­trol, and Ger­many was hailed for its ef­fec­tive cri­sis man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Now, just nine months later, this op­ti­mism is gone.</p>
    <p>It was In­te­rior Min­is­ter Horst See­hofer who con­ceded the ob­vi­ous. The ad­van­tage Ger­many had gained on the pan­demic in spring has been squan­dered, he said in an in­ter­view this month.</p>
    <p>Mr See­hofer, one of the strong­men in the gov­ern­ment, made clear that the cit­i­zens were not to blame for this fail­ure. “Above all, this is due to in­suf­fi­cient mea­sures,” he is quoted as say­ing.</p>
    <p>Last month, Ger­many went into a light lock­down, hop­ing this could pre-empt stricter mea­sures and pre­vent fur­ther dam­age to the econ­omy. This, how­ever, the mag­a­zine Der Spiegel now calls noth­ing less than “pos­si­bly the big­gest po­lit­i­cal mis­judg­ment of the year”.</p>
    <p>When it be­came clear that the re­duced ver­sion of the lock­down had not done the trick, a rigid one went into ef­fect last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>In fact, Ger­man pol­i­tics th­ese days is mainly driven by num­bers – and they are sober­ing: Daily new in­fec­tions have climbed well over 30,000, an in­crease by one-third com­pared with a month ear­lier. Although the death rate, with a to­tal of over 26,000, is still a rather low one in Europe, this in­di­ca­tor is also clearly on the rise.</p>
    <p>And the oc­cu­pancy rate of in­ten­sive care beds in hos­pi­tals has seen a steep up­swing to more than 5,000, al­most dou­bling since early last month. Nurs­ing staff are work­ing at ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the first lock­down in spring, the wave of in­fec­tions could be re­versed, but this is not hap­pen­ing now. In­fec­tion rates are still ris­ing, driv­ing up con­cerns that at some point, hos­pi­tals may not be able to han­dle all new in­com­ing pa­tients.</p>
    <p>A few days ago, one doc­tor in a hos­pi­tal in the state of Sax­ony said that the triage sys­tem had to be ap­plied. Triage is used in cri­sis sit­u­a­tions when de­ci­sions have to be taken on which pa­tients will re­ceive treat­ment. The ba­sic val­ues un­der­ly­ing triage de­ci­sions in­clude pri­ori­ti­sa­tion of med­i­cal ur­gency, ca­pac­ity to ben­e­fit, fair­ness, sever­ity of the health con­di­tion of the pa­tient and likely out­come.</p>
    <p>The doc­tor’s state­ment pro­duced a pub­lic out­cry – but also brought to light how se­vere the sit­u­a­tion has be­come.</p>
    <p>The rude awak­en­ing in the au­tumn months of Septem­ber to Novem­ber makes the re­stric­tions of sum­mer look like a cake­walk.</p>
    <p>Although Dr Merkel was telling the pub­lic that the win­ter months would be much worse, some heads of Ger­man states were more con­cerned about their lo­cal busi­nesses and did not heed the warn­ings.</p>
    <p>Since many of the re­stric­tions in Ger­many have to be im­ple­mented at the re­gional level, the op­tions to act are lim­ited for a chan­cel­lor.</p>
    <p>The fed­eral sys­tem is based on per­sua­sion rather than by de­cree.</p>
    <p>Dr Merkel has not been able to pre­vail over lo­cal pre­miers, even those from her own party, the con­ser­va­tive Chris­tian</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic Union.</p>
    <p>Two things have con­trib­uted to Dr Merkel’s weak­ness. Since she gave up the chair­man­ship of the party two years ago, she has lost in­flu­ence within party struc­tures. A loss of po­lit­i­cal clout also came when she an­nounced she will not run for an­other term as chan­cel­lor in the 2021 elec­tion. She is not a lame duck yet, but her po­lit­i­cal en­vi­ron­ment is clearly al­ready fo­cused on a fu­ture with­out her.</p>
    <p>And an­other con­flict is al­ready on the hori­zon: Although BioNTech – a fore­run­ner in de­vel­op­ing a vac­cine against Covid-19 – is Ger­man, it looks as if Ger­many will not be able to ac­quire enough doses to get peo­ple vac­ci­nated un­til next sum­mer.</p>
    <p>Ber­lin strictly wanted to toe the line of the Euro­pean Union and not make use of the home ad­van­tage. This means Ger­many will get the vac­cine not ear­lier than all the other mem­bers of the EU, and only ac­cord­ing to an al­lo­ca­tion key.</p>
    <p>But ac­cord­ing to a re­port in Der Spiegel, the EU may not have con­tracted enough doses, or may have signed agree­ments with the wrong part­ners. While the vac­cine pro­duc­tion of BioNTech-Pfizer is on track, Bri­tish-Swedish As­traZeneca is in trou­ble with its test runs, French Sanofi may get the green light only at the end of next year, and CureVac, also Ger­man, prob­a­bly needs an­other half year un­til its vac­cine is ready.</p>
    <p>Ger­many, which needs up to 120 mil­lion doses to vac­ci­nate around 70 per cent of its pop­u­la­tion twice, now prob­a­bly has to wait till well into au­tumn or even win­ter next year be­fore full im­mu­ni­sa­tion is achieved.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, vac­ci­na­tions are al­ready un­der way in Bri­tain and the United States.</p>
    <p>The rude awak­en­ing in the au­tumn months of Septem­ber to Novem­ber makes the re­stric­tions of sum­mer look like a cake­walk... Since many of the re­stric­tions in Ger­many have to be im­ple­mented at the re­gional level, the op­tions to act are lim­ited for a chan­cel­lor. The fed­eral sys­tem is based on per­sua­sion rather than by de­cree.</p>

        <p data-role="text">A near-empty Neuer Wall shop&#xAD;ping street in Ham&#xAD;burg last Fri&#xAD;day. Ger&#xAD;many went into a light lock&#xAD;down last month, hop&#xAD;ing this would curb the spread of the coro&#xAD;n&#xAD;avirus while pre-empt&#xAD;ing stricter mea&#xAD;sures. It did not do the trick, and a rigid lock&#xAD;down was im&#xAD;posed last Wed&#xAD;nes&#xAD;day.</p>
