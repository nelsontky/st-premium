    <p>SYD­NEY • An emo­tional Nick Kyr­gios pulled out of the US Open yes­ter­day for “the hun­dreds of thou­sands of Amer­i­cans who have lost their lives” be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>His de­ci­sion fol­lows fel­low Aus­tralian and women’s world No. 1 Ash­leigh Barty, who last week with­drew from the Aug 31-Sept 13 hard­court Grand Slam in New York, cit­ing “sig­nif­i­cant risks” amid the cur­rent cli­mate.</p>
    <p>“Dear Ten­nis, I will not be play­ing this year at the US Open. It hurts me at my core not to be out there com­pet­ing i n one of the sport’s great­est are­nas, Arthur Ashe Sta­dium,” Kyr­gios said in a Twit­ter video. “But I’m sit­ting out for the peo­ple, for my Aussies, for the hun­dreds of thou­sands of Amer­i­cans who have lost their lives, for all of you.”</p>
    <p>More than 157,000 peo­ple have died from Covid-19 in the US, with over 4.7 mil­lion in­fec­tions since the pan­demic’s out­set in March.</p>
    <p>Kyr­gios, ranked just world No. 40 but still con­sid­ered to be a ma­jor draw-card, last month blasted the ATP Tour as “self­ish” for press­ing ahead with plans for the Flush­ing Mead­ows event.</p>
    <p>He tem­pered crit­i­cism of the or­gan­is­ers dur­ing his video state­ment, say­ing he had “no prob­lem” with it be­ing held, cit­ing the need to keep non-play­ing per­son­nel like restau­rant work­ers, clean­ers, and locker room at­ten­dants em­ployed.</p>
    <p>But Kyr­gios had strong words for some of the top names in the game, de­liv­er­ing a veiled jab at those who took part in No­vak Djokovic’s re­cent ill-fated Adria Tour ex­hi­bi­tion. The lack of safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures and the stag­ing of af­terevent par­ties led to pos­i­tive Covid-19 tests for the world No. 1 and fel­low play­ers Vik­tor Troicki, Grigor Dim­itrov and Borna Coric.</p>
    <p>“Ten­nis play­ers, you have to act in the in­ter­ests of each other and work to­gether,” said the 25-yearold. “You can’t be danc­ing on ta­bles, money-grab­bing your way around Europe or try­ing to make a quick buck host­ing an ex­hi­bi­tion – that’s just so self­ish. Think of the other peo­ple for once, that’s what this virus is about.”</p>
    <p>Those same fears over Covid-19 will be of the ut­most con­cern for WTA Palermo or­gan­is­ers to­day.</p>
    <p>The clay-court event marks the first time in five months that a pro ten­nis tour­na­ment is be­ing staged af­ter both the women’s cir­cuit and the men’s ATP Tour were halted in March due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers con­firmed on Satur­day that a qual­i­fier, re­ported to be 140th-ranked Vik­toriya To­mova of Bul­garia, had been in­fected, but in­sisted the event would still be go­ing ahead.</p>
    <p>Top seed Pe­tra Mar­tic is hope­ful noth­ing else will de­rail the com­pe­ti­tion. “It’s been so long with­out ten­nis, with­out com­pe­ti­tion, with­out the adren­a­line that we all kind of love,” she said.</p>
    <p>“To be back on the court right now is re­ally just a priv­i­lege with­out think­ing about any re­sults or any goals or fo­cused on num­bers or any­thing else.”</p>
    <p>The 15th-ranked Croat is the top draw af­ter Wim­ble­don cham­pion Si­mona Halep of Ro­ma­nia had to with­draw ow­ing to travel con­cerns. Af­ter Palermo, the WTA will move to Prague from next Mon­day.</p>
