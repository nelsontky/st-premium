    <p>A “flag­ship killer” smart­phone is one that of­fers high-end hard­ware at an af­ford­able price.</p>
    <p>One of the best ex­am­ples was 2018’s Xiaomi Po­co­phone F1, which mar­ried flag­ship-tier per­for­mance and ex­cel­lent bat­tery life with bud­get fea­tures such as a huge cam­era notch and a plas­tic chas­sis.</p>
    <p>But, de­spite the F1 gen­er­at­ing much buzz among smart­phone en­thu­si­asts, Xiaomi did not fol­low up with a se­quel.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the Chi­nese smart­phone maker spun the Poco sub-brand off as a stand­alone firm in Jan­uary this year. Poco sub­se­quently re­leased a se­quel to the F1 in May.</p>
    <p>Mar­keted as the “ul­ti­mate flag­ship killer”, the Poco F2 Pro ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore ear­lier this month, priced at $899.</p>
    <p>This is sig­nif­i­cantly higher than the F1 ($449), though the F2 Pro comes with sev­eral ma­jor up­grades over its pre­de­ces­sor, such as 5G con­nec­tiv­ity, an Oled screen, a big­ger bat­tery and quad rear cam­eras.</p>
    <p>What ini­tially caught my eye is the F2 Pro’s al­most bezel-less screen with no cam­era notch. Poco has gone with a mo­torised pop-up selfie cam­era, which emerges with much fan­fare – com­plete with flash­ing lights and a short jin­gle – from the top of the phone.</p>
    <p>Com­plet­ing the all-screen fa­cade is an in-dis­play fin­ger­print sen­sor un­der its screen. It gen­er­ally works well enough, though there were the oc­ca­sional misses.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of the pop-up cam­era, the F2 Pro lacks wa­ter­proof­ing – a typ­i­cal fea­ture of a flag­ship phone.</p>
    <p>Also miss­ing is wire­less charg­ing, though I do not miss it that much be­cause the F2 Pro, like many newer phones, charges very fast when us­ing a ca­ble.</p>
    <p>With its bun­dled 33W charger, the F2 Pro can be fully topped up in an hour. This is im­pres­sive con­sid­er­ing its large 4,700mAh bat­tery.</p>
    <p>This up­sized bat­tery (from the F1’s 4,000mAh) adds to the weight of the phone (218g). Cou­pled with a slip­pery glass-and-metal chas­sis and a rel­a­tively l arge 6.67-inch screen, the F2 Pro is un­wieldy.</p>
    <p>Like flag­ship phones, the F2 Pro uses Oled tech­nol­ogy for its dis­play. Thus, blacks look truly dark and colours ap­pear more vi­brant than its pre­de­ces­sor’s LCD screen. And, given its lack of bezels or notch, this screen is ex­cel­lent for watch­ing videos.</p>
    <p>The Oled screen also en­ables an al­ways-on dis­play fea­ture that shows the clock and key sta­tus in­di­ca­tors, such as bat­tery life, when the phone is asleep.</p>
    <p>In fact, the only thing lack­ing about the F2 Pro’s dis­play is its stan­dard 60Hz re­fresh rate when com­pared with the smoother 90Hz or 120Hz ver­sion in flag­ship phones.</p>
    <p>The quad rear cam­eras are not quite up to par with the ones in flag­ship phones. The best of the bunch is the 64-megapixel (MP) main cam­era, which pro­duces crisp, de­tailed pho­tos in good light. But shots of the sky ex­hibit some chro­matic noise, while the over­all white bal­ance is not as ac­cu­rate as my Google Pixel 4 XL.</p>
    <p>Among its sec­ondary cam­eras is a tele­photo macro cam­era that sup­ports 2x op­ti­cal zoom and close-up shots. The ul­tra-wide cam­era is use­ful enough, but the pho­tos from it are much nois­ier com­pared to ones taken by the main cam­era.</p>
    <p>Lastly, the depth sen­sor plays its part to en­sure portrait shots (with ad­justable blurred back­ground ef­fect) mostly turn out fine.</p>
    <p>For low-light shots, the cam­era’s Night mode, which takes around four sec­onds to snap a photo, is de­cent enough for a mid-range phone. Scenes are def­i­nitely brighter while high­lights are not overblown. Over­all, how­ever, pho­tos are soft and noisy.</p>
    <p>Given its em­pha­sis on high-end specs, I was un­sur­prised by the F2 Pro’s per­for­mance. It feels fast and re­spon­sive when open­ing or switch­ing apps.</p>
    <p>This fluid feel is re­flected in its Geek­bench 5 scores: 904 (sin­glecore) and 3,362 (multi-core). They are vir­tu­ally iden­ti­cal to those of the OnePlus 8 Pro, which has the same flag­ship Qual­comm Snap­dragon 865 chip.</p>
    <p>But I am blown away by the F2 Pro’s in­cred­i­ble bat­tery life. In The Straits Times’ video-loop bat­tery test with the screen set to max­i­mum bright­ness, it clocked an as­ton­ish­ing 19 hours and 10 min­utes, mak­ing it the long­est-last­ing phone I have ever tested.</p>
    <p>In the end, per­haps the ex­tra weight it car­ries is worth it for such im­pres­sive bat­tery stamina.</p>
    <p>As a flag­ship killer, the F2 Pro gives more ex­pen­sive phones a run for their money – at least in terms of build qual­ity, per­for­mance and bat­tery life. But its av­er­age cam­eras and lack of wa­ter­proof­ing hold it back.</p>
