    <p>Four years after be­ing sex­u­ally ha­rassed by her boss – the mayor of Seoul city – and ig­nored when she sought help within the of­fice, a woman mus­tered all her courage to re­port him to the po­lice.</p>
    <p>“I wanted to re­ceive a hu­mane apol­ogy and (for him to) be judged by the law,” she said in a state­ment. But it was not to be.</p>
    <p>Mr Park Won-soon was found dead in an ap­par­ent sui­cide in the woods of Mount Bu­gak on July 10, two days after his for­mer sec­re­tary lodged a com­plaint against him.</p>
    <p>This made him the fourth in a string of politi­cians from the rul­ing Demo­cratic Party (DP) to be hit by sex scan­dals – one is cur­rently in jail for re­peat­edly rap­ing his sec­re­tary – and his case was all the more shock­ing as he had earned a rep­u­ta­tion for fight­ing for women’s rights from as early as the 1980s, when he was a lawyer.</p>
    <p>His death has also prompted soul search­ing about deep-rooted malpractic­es in South Korea’s male­dom­i­nated work en­vi­ron­ment, as more women are now em­bold­ened to speak up against the back­drop of a global #Me­Too move­ment against sex­ual ha­rass­ment.</p>
    <p>Legally, the case has been closed as South Korean law does not al­low in­dict­ment against a dead sus­pect. But the vic­tim, whose iden­tity is with­held, re­fuses to be si­lenced.</p>
    <p>She has held two press con­fer­ences, speak­ing through her lawyer, and she helped the po­lice to un­lock Mr Park’s phone on July 22.</p>
    <p>She is backed by women’s rights groups, who called her sit­u­a­tion “a case of or­gan­ised crime sus­tained by power”.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, the Na­tional Hu­man Rights Com­mis­sion an­nounced that its rep­re­sen­ta­tives have been in talks with the vic­tim and will launch a probe into the case and a re­view of gov­ern­ment mea­sures against sex­ual ha­rass­ment in­volv­ing high-rank­ing of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>Law pro­fes­sor Lee Jae-min of Seoul Na­tional Uni­ver­sity said there is still a need to find out the truth, de­spite the mayor’s death.</p>
    <p>“Given the grav­ity of the sit­u­a­tion and the peo­ple in­volved, in­clud­ing Mayor Park, the nec­es­sary in­ves­ti­ga­tions by the rel­e­vant gov­ern­ment agen­cies will con­tinue to be car­ried out, even though it takes time. We need to clar­ify what hap­pened,” he told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s pa­tri­ar­chal so­ci­ety and hi­er­ar­chi­cal work cul­ture makes it hard for a female sub­or­di­nate to say no to a male su­pe­rior’s de­mands, even if it is sex­ual in na­ture, for fear of los­ing her job.</p>
    <p>In Mr Park’s case, the vic­tim said she ap­proached some 20 peo­ple in the of­fice for help, but did not get any support. Some waved it off and ex­pressed dis­be­lief, while oth­ers blamed her for be­ing “pretty”.</p>
    <p>“Let his death lead to a deeper re­flec­tion and frank dis­cus­sion on the toxic grip of sex­ual ha­rass­ment in</p>

    <p>the work­place, and in our cul­ture at large,” hu­man sci­ences pro­fes­sor Cho Kyung-jin of Cy­ber Uni­ver­sity of Korea said in a com­men­tary for The Korea Times news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>“This is not about la­belling Mayor Park as a per­vert, nor is it about deny­ing his legacy. It is about recog­nis­ing a sys­tem that en­ables pow­er­ful men to take ad­van­tage of their po­si­tion to do what they please with female staff in the lower ech­e­lons of the rank and file.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, po­lit­i­cal watch­ers warn that the sex­ual abuse sur­fac­ing in the DP does not bode well for the rul­ing party and Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in. Both rose to power promis­ing gen­der equal­ity and bet­ter treat­ment of women.</p>
    <p>“The fact that of­fi­cials from Moon’s party are in­volved in sex­ual abuse against women makes a mock­ery of the Pres­i­dent’s ef­forts,” said Ms Jes­sica Lee, a senior re­search fel­low on East Asia at Quincy In­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>The al­le­ga­tions against Mr Park could “spell trou­ble” for the Moon ad­min­is­tra­tion in the re­main­ing two years of his five-year term, Ms Lee added. This is es­pe­cially so if the rul­ing party loses the may­oral seats in Seoul and Bu­san – the country’s two largest and most im­por­tant cities – at April’s by-elec­tion.</p>
    <p>For­mer Bu­san mayor Oh Keo-don re­signed in April after sex­ual ha­rass­ment charges against him sur­faced.</p>
    <p>Law­maker Nam In-soon, the head of DP’s sex­ual abuse erad­i­ca­tion task force and a close ally of the late Seoul mayor, of­fered a tear­ful apol­ogy last Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“The world has changed, and so has the pub­lic’s view­point,” she was cited as say­ing. “Female vot­ers will no longer want to support the Demo­cratic Party after see­ing a string of sex­ual abuse cases in­volv­ing DP lo­cal gov­ern­ment heads.”</p>
    <p>Oh re­signed i n April after it emerged that he had sex­u­ally as­saulted a female em­ployee. He was also ex­pelled from the rul­ing Demo­cratic Party. The po­lice sought to ar­rest him on charges of an in­de­cent act by com­pul­sion but a Bu­san court de­nied the re­quest in June, say­ing there was al­ready enough ev­i­dence against him and de­ten­tion was not nec­es­sary. In­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing.</p>
