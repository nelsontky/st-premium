    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • With 98.4 mil­lion fol­low­ers, Charli D’Ame­lio (left) is the top cre­ator on TikTok. But that num­ber is falling.</p>
    <p>The 16-year-old so­cial me­dia star has lost more than one mil­lion fol­low­ers since she posted a YouTube video ear­lier in the week, in which she whined about not hav­ing 100 mil­lion fol­low­ers. At the time, the dancer had 95 mil­lion fol­low­ers and was inch­ing to­wards the mile­stone fig­ure.</p>
    <p>In the video, she is seen hav­ing din­ner with her par­ents, sis­ter Dixie and beauty in­flu­encer James Charles.</p>
    <p>In an ex­change be­tween D’Ame­lio and Charles, she com­plained that she would not hit her tar­get of go­ing from one mil­lion to 100 mil­lion fol­low­ers within a year.</p>
    <p>“Ugh. I wish I had more time,” she said, to which he re­torted: “Was the 95 mil­lion not enough for you?”</p>
    <p>In the same video, she and her sis­ter Dixie were seen be­hav­ing rudely while hav­ing a meal cooked by a pri­vate chef.</p>
    <p>At one point, Dixie, who has 43.8 mil­lion TikTok fol­low­ers, gagged on a snail and vom­ited, while Charli asked for dino nuggets.</p>
    <p>Their bratty be­hav­iour prompted a wave of back­lash, as they were called “en­ti­tled”, “dis­re­spect­ful” and “un­grate­ful” in on­line com­ments.</p>
    <p>Sub­se­quently, Charli posted a teary mes­sage on In­sta­gram Live on Thurs­day about what she termed a “mis­un­der­stand­ing”.</p>
    <p>Wip­ing away tears, she said she had re­ceived death threats and hate­ful mes­sages, adding: “Peo­ple just, like, bla­tantly dis­re­spect­ing the fact that I’m still a hu­man be­ing is not okay at all.</p>
    <p>“And if this is the com­mu­nity I’m in and the com­mu­nity that I put my­self in, I don’t know if I want to do that any­more.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, even as for­mer fans un­fol­lowed her in droves, she is in no dan­ger of los­ing her crown – the sec­ond-most pop­u­lar TikTok per­son­al­ity, Ad­di­son Rae, has 69.1 mil­lion fol­low­ers.</p>
