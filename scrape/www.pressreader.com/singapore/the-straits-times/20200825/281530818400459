    <p>Two ex­plo­sions rocked the in­sur­gency-plagued town of Jolo in south­ern Philip­pines yes­ter­day, killing at least 15 peo­ple, in­clud­ing a sus­pected sui­cide bomber. Sus­pi­cions fall on a fac­tion of the Abu Sayyaf ex­trem­ist group which was be­hind twin sui­cide bomb­ings last year that tar­geted a Catholic cathe­dral, also in Jolo. WORLD</p>
    <p>Two ex­plo­sions rocked the in­sur­gency-plagued town of Jolo in the south­ern Philip­pines yes­ter­day, killing at least 15 peo­ple, in­clud­ing a sus­pected sui­cide bomber.</p>
    <p>Ini­tial re­ports said the first ex­plo­sion hap­pened at around noon.</p>
    <p>The tar­get seemed to have been a mil­i­tary truck parked in front of a com­mer­cial build­ing near the Jolo town plaza. At least six sol­diers and six civil­ians were killed in the first ex­plo­sion, ac­cord­ing to Ma­jor-Gen­eral Cor­leto Vin­luan, chief of the Western Min­danao Com­mand.</p>
    <p>A sec­ond blast hap­pened at around 1pm at a nearby street, as in­ves­ti­ga­tors were al­ready se­cur­ing the first tar­get. Cit­ing un­ver­i­fied ac­counts, Maj-Gen Vin­luan said a woman set off a bomb as a sol­dier ap­proached her. Both the sus­pected bomber and the sol­dier died. A po­lice­man was also killed.</p>
    <p>Some 70 other sol­diers, po­lice­men and civil­ians were in­jured, Colonel Rafael Abund­abar, a spokesman for the Western Min­danao Com­mand, told on­line news site Rap­pler.</p>
    <p>Th­ese at­tacks were rem­i­nis­cent of twin sui­cide bomb­ings that tar­geted a Catholic cathe­dral, also in Jolo, in Jan­uary last year.</p>
    <p>At least 23 were killed and more than 100 in­jured in that at­tack.</p>
    <p>Mil­i­tary re­ports said an In­done­sian cou­ple blew them­selves up min­utes apart, one in­side the cathe­dral and the other out­side.</p>
    <p>Com­mu­ni­ca­tions Sec­re­tary Martin An­da­nar said of the lat­est at­tacks yes­ter­day: “We strongly de­nounce the twin blasts that tran­spired in Jolo... to­day. Grave acts against hu­man­ity, such as th­ese, have no place in our so­ci­ety, es­pe­cially as we con­tinue to re­spond to the Covid-19 pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Maj-Gen Vin­luan said yes­ter­day’s at­tacks could be the work of the same fac­tion of the Abu Sayyaf ex­trem­ist group that was be­hind the cathe­dral bomb­ings.</p>
    <p>He named Mundi Sawad­jaan, nephew of Abu Sayyaf chief­tain Hatib Sawad­jaan, as the main sus­pect in the lat­est at­tacks.</p>
    <p>Hatib Sawad­jaan, deemed an act­ing “emir” of the Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria in the Philip­pines, is in­cluded in the United States’ list of global ter­ror­ists. His group was said to have aided the In­done­sian cou­ple be­hind the sui­cide bomb­ings at the Jolo cathe­dral.</p>
    <p>It was also be­hind an at­tack in June last year on an army coun­tert­er­ror­ism unit brigade in In­danan town, Sulu prov­ince, that killed eight peo­ple and in­jured 22.</p>
    <p>This was the first of­fi­cially con­firmed case of a sui­cide bomb­ing car­ried out by a Filipino – iden­ti­fied as Nor­man La­suca – in the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>Hatib Sawad­jaan also over­saw the 2012 kid­nap­ping of Arab News’ Asia bureau chief Baker Atyani, who was work­ing as a cor­re­spon­dent for tele­vi­sion news chan­nel Al-Ara­biya.</p>
    <p>Mundi Sawad­jaan is be­lieved to have taken over the reins from Hatib Sawad­jaan, who is in his 60s and re­ported to have been se­ri­ously in­jured in a re­cent fire­fight with se­cu­rity forces.</p>
    <p>Maj-Gen Vin­luan said the per­pe­tra­tors of yes­ter­day’s at­tacks could be the two sus­pected bombers who were be­ing tracked by four army in­tel­li­gence of­fi­cers in June. In cir­cum­stances that are still murky, the in­tel­li­gence of­fi­cers were gunned down by po­lice­men en­forc­ing rou­tine quar­an­tine re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Mundi Sawad­jaan was said to be of­fer­ing refuge to the two pur­ported bombers. The mil­i­tary and po­lice have traded ac­cu­sa­tions as in­ves­ti­ga­tors tried to sort out what re­ally hap­pened.</p>
    <p>Maj-Gen Vin­luan ear­lier told law­mak­ers at a con­gres­sional hear­ing it was pos­si­ble that the po­lice­men knew the two sus­pected bombers.</p>
    <p>But Bri­gadier-Gen­eral Manuel Abu, chief of the Bangsamoro po­lice force, said one of the in­tel­li­gence of­fi­cers killed had ties to the il­le­gal drug trade in Jolo.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s at­tacks came just weeks af­ter the ar­rest of another Abu Sayyaf chief­tain, An­dulji­han Susukan, through the in­ter­ven­tion of Moro Na­tional Lib­er­a­tion Front leader Nur Misuari. Susukan had been wanted in the Philip­pines and Malaysia for a se­ries of kid­nap­pings off the coast of Sabah from 2013.</p>
