    <p>BEI­JING • Bei­jing has tight­ened Covid-19 curbs over con­cerns that China’s mass travel dur­ing the hol­i­day pe­riod could cause cases to spike in the cap­i­tal, as it re­ported lo­cally trans­mit­ted cases for a fourth straight day yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A meet­ing led by the cap­i­tal’s Com­mu­nist Party boss Cai Qi urged all dis­tricts in Bei­jing to en­ter emer­gency mode, seal­ing off res­i­den­tial com­pounds and vil­lages where in­fec­tions are found.</p>
    <p>China’s south­ern tech­nol­ogy hub of Shen­zhen re­ported one asymp­to­matic case yes­ter­day – a pa­tient who made two busi­ness trips to Bei­jing this month.</p>
    <p>Shunyi dis­trict, where all the re­cent coro­n­avirus cases have been re­ported, has de­clared a wartime mode and test­ing for all its 800,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>All the cases re­ported last Satur­day were close con­tacts of pre­vi­ous cases.</p>
    <p>Two vil­lages i n Shunyi have been sealed off as a re­sult.</p>
    <p>Chaoyang dis­trict, which neigh­bours Shunyi, has fin­ished test­ing 234,413 peo­ple in three neigh­bour­hoods, with none test­ing pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple who have not re­ceived their test re­sults are not al­lowed to go out, the dis­trict gov­ern­ment said.</p>
    <p>Some res­i­den­tial com­pounds in the Tongzhou dis­trict, 36km south of Shunyi, have reim­posed tem­per­a­ture checks upon en­try, and the num­ber of en­trances has been re­duced.</p>
    <p>Shunyi’s ex­ec­u­tive deputy chief Zhi Xian­wei said the dis­trict ac­ti­vated an emer­gency re­sponse plan, do­ing epi­demi­o­log­i­cal sur­veys, source trac­ing, nu­cleic acid test­ing, com­mu­nity man­age­ment and en­vi­ron­men­tal dis­in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>China has largely brought the coro­n­avirus un­der con­trol, but spo­radic cases are resur­fac­ing in a small num­ber of cities.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties plan to vac­ci­nate 50 mil­lion peo­ple in high-risk groups be­fore the week-long Chi­nese New Year hol­i­day from Feb 11, said state me­dia Global Times.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has asked its civil ser­vants to stay in the city from Fri­day un­til the hol­i­day, and the pub­lic to avoid un­nec­es­sary travel dur­ing the pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic venues such as theme parks and churches have scaled back op­er­at­ing hours.</p>
    <p>Some Catholic churches in Bei­jing, in­clud­ing Wang­fu­jing’s Catholic church, have stopped ad­mit­ting church­go­ers and halted group ac­tiv­i­ties, the arch­dio­cese of Bei­jing said on its web­site.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese main­land re­ported 22 newly con­firmed Covid-19 cases yes­ter­day. Seven of them were re­ported in north-east China’s Liaon­ing prov­ince, while five were re­ported in Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the coun­try’s avi­a­tion reg­u­la­tor said yes­ter­day that it will sus­pend flights to and from Bri­tain un­til Jan 10 over fears of a new strain of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The to­tal num­ber of con­firmed Covid-19 cases on the main­land reached 86,955 by last Satur­day, and 4,634 had died as a re­sult of the virus, ac­cord­ing to the Na­tional Health Com­mis­sion.</p>
