    <p>A fish­ing boat car­ry­ing 370 mi­grants landed overnight on the Ital­ian is­land of Lampe­dusa, lo­cal news agen­cies re­ported yes­ter­day, as a nearby hu­man­i­tar­ian ship car­ry­ing an­other 350 peo­ple sought a port of dis­em­barka­tion. Among them were 150 peo­ple res­cued in the Mediter­ranean by the MV Louise Michel. WORLD</p>
    <p>ROME • A fish­ing boat car­ry­ing nearly 370 mi­grants landed overnight on the Ital­ian is­land of Lampe­dusa, the coun­try’s news agen­cies re­ported yes­ter­day, as a nearby hu­man­i­tar­ian ship car­ry­ing an­other 350 peo­ple sought a port of dis­em­barka­tion.</p>
    <p>Italy has been strug­gling in re­cent months to deal with daily ar­rivals of hun­dreds of mi­grants at its south­ern shores, a task com­pli­cated by se­cu­rity mea­sures im­posed by the on­go­ing coro­n­avirus cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The ves­sel car­ry­ing 367 peo­ple was in danger of sink­ing due to high winds, and was es­corted by the Ital­ian coast guard and po­lice to the is­land’s port, Ansa news agency said.</p>
    <p>They were met at the port by a de­mon­stra­tion or­gan­ised by the far-right, anti-im­mi­grant League party.</p>
    <p>The mi­grants un­der­went tem­per­a­ture checks be­fore they were taken to an emer­gency re­cep­tion cen­tre on the is­land which now houses some 1,160 peo­ple – 10 times its max­i­mum ca­pac­ity – Lampe­dusa’s mayor, Mr Toto Martello, told Ansa.</p>
    <p>About 30 other small boats, mostly from the Tu­nisian coast, had al­ready reached the is­land as of Friday, car­ry­ing some 500 mi­grants, the Ital­ian press re­ported.</p>
    <p>Mr Se­bas­tiano Musumeci, the right-lean­ing leader of sis­ter is­land Si­cily, yes­ter­day wrote on Face­book that he would ask the govern­ment for a meet­ing on the “hu­man­i­tar­ian and health cri­sis”.</p>
    <p>The Ital­ian coast guard on Saturday also trans­ported 49 peo­ple res­cued in the Mediter­ranean by the MV Louise Michel, a ves­sel funded by Bri­tish street artist Banksy.</p>
    <p>The 150 other pas­sen­gers on that ship were trans­ferred late on Saturday to hu­man­i­tar­ian rescue ves­sel Sea-Watch 4, which now has some 350 peo­ple on board and is look­ing for a port of dis­em­barka­tion. The crew of the ves­sel char­tered by Ger­man non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion Sea Watch and med­i­cal char­ity Doc­tors With­out Bor­ders wrote on</p>
    <p>Twit­ter that it was treat­ing peo­ple for “fuel burns, de­hy­dra­tion, hy­pother­mia & trau­matic in­juries”.</p>
    <p>The res­cued mi­grants later said three peo­ple had died at sea.</p>
    <p>Banksy, who keeps his iden­tity a se­cret, ex­plained in an on­line video that he had bought the ship to help mi­grants “be­cause EU au­thor­i­ties de­lib­er­ately ig­nore dis­tress calls from non-Euro­peans”.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, at least three mi­grants died when a fire broke out on a boat car­ry­ing them close to the south­ern coast of Italy yes­ter­day, po­lice and health of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>An­other five mi­grants were in­jured and taken to hos­pi­tal, the health au­thor­i­ties in the Ital­ian port city of Cro­tone said. Two po­lice of­fi­cers were hurt as they tried to help the mi­grants, the po­lice said.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to United Na­tions refugee agency UNHCR, at­tempts by mi­grant boats to cross the Mediter­ranean into Europe have in­creased by 91 per cent from Jan­uary to July this year over last year’s fig­ures, to more than 14,000 peo­ple.</p>
