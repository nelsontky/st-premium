    <p>Med­i­cal pro­fes­sion­als and ad­vo­cates have praised a pro­posal to in­clude in­surance cov­er­age of treat­ment for drug ad­dic­tion, al­co­holism and in­juries aris­ing from at­tempted sui­cide or de­lib­er­ate self­harm un­der MediShield Life.</p>
    <p>This will be a step in the right di­rec­tion that will bet­ter sup­port pa­tients who need such treat­ments and re­duce the stigma against seek­ing help, they said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The changes were among the rec­om­men­da­tions an­nounced by the MediShield Life Coun­cil on Tues­day. They will likely take ef­fect early next year if they are ac­cepted.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Straits Times, Dr Daniel Fung, chair­man of the med­i­cal board at the In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health, said the change would help re­duce stigma and lower the fi­nan­cial and psy­cho­log­i­cal bar­ri­ers as­so­ci­ated with seek­ing help.</p>
    <p>He added that it will also serve as a sig­nal to the pub­lic that ad­dic­tion and self-harm can be med­i­cally treated and are not sim­ply so­cially un­de­sir­able be­hav­iours.</p>
    <p>“Stigma is de­ter­mined by the way so­ci­ety views the ill­ness, and if there is a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of the med­i­cal as­pect of such be­hav­iours, there will be bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of the med­i­cal con­di­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Lim Boon Leng, a psy­chi­a­trist at Gle­nea­gles Hos­pi­tal, agreed. “Ad­dic­tion is a chronic re­laps­ing med­i­cal con­di­tion, and like many other med­i­cal con­di­tions, it is re­lated to a com­plex interplay be­tween one’s genes and en­vi­ron­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Sui­cide ten­den­cies and self­harm, whilst not di­ag­noses in them­selves, are of­ten symp­toms of un­der­ly­ing psy­chi­atric di­ag­noses like de­pres­sion, which can be treated.”</p>
    <p>He said th­ese psy­chi­atric con­di­tions are bona fide med­i­cal con­di­tions and should be viewed as such.</p>
    <p>“Re­mov­ing them from the ex­clu­sions is sig­nif­i­cant in re­mov­ing the dis­crim­i­na­tion and stig­ma­ti­sa­tion to­wards men­tal ill­nesses. Hope­fully, this is the first step to­wards pro­vid­ing bet­ter in­surance cov­er­age for all men­tal ill­nesses.”</p>
    <p>The rea­son­ing be­hind ex­clud­ing at­tempted sui­cide and self-harm from MediShield Life cov­er­age was to not en­cour­age such be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>In March, Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong, who was then Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Health, had said this in re­sponse to a par­lia­men­tary ques­tion asked by then Nom­i­nated MP Anthea Ong.</p>
    <p>But Dr Lim said yes­ter­day that con­tin­u­ing to ex­clude such treat­ments would not be ef­fec­tive in dis­cour­ag­ing the be­hav­iours and would in­stead dis­cour­age af­flicted in­di­vid­u­als from seek­ing help and treat­ment.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, would re­mov­ing treat­ments of di­a­betes en­cour­age the pub­lic to adopt be­hav­iours to pre­vent di­a­betes? I don’t think so.”</p>
    <p>Ad­vo­cacy groups also praised the pro­posed changes.</p>
    <p>Mr Gasper Tan, chief ex­ec­u­tive of com­mu­nity sup­port group Sa­mar­i­tans of Sin­ga­pore, said the group hopes the in­clu­sion of treat­ment for sui­cide at­tempts in MediShield Life will lower the bar­rier to seek­ing help for in­di­vid­u­als fac­ing a cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“The feel­ings of con­fu­sion, worry and shame fol­low­ing a sui­cide at­tempt can get very over­whelm­ing. The fi­nan­cial wor­ries fol­low­ing med­i­cal treat­ment would, at times, am­plify their feel­ings of hope­less­ness and trauma,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Va­lerie Lim, a co-found­ing mem­ber of the PleaseS­tay youth sui­cide pre­ven­tion ad­vo­cacy group, said the rec­om­mended changes to MediShield Life are a sig­nif­i­cant step for­ward. Like the de­crim­i­nal­i­sa­tion of sui­cide at­tempts in Jan­uary, th­ese changes re­flect a recog­ni­tion that treat­ment and sup­port are bet­ter so­lu­tions than pun­ish­ment and penal­ties, she added.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health (MOH) ear­lier this week an­nounced the first ma­jor re­view of MediShield Life since its launch in 2015. A slew of rec­om­men­da­tions has been put for­ward by the MediShield Life Coun­cil to bal­ance the health in­surance scheme’s “bene­fits and pre­mi­ums to keep pace with evolv­ing med­i­cal prac­tice, health­care cost in­fla­tion and ac­tual claims ex­pe­ri­ence, so that it con­tin­ues to pro­vide as­sur­ance for Sin­ga­pore­ans while re­main­ing sus­tain­able”.</p>
    <p>Bene­fits will be en­hanced, with higher claim lim­its for a num­ber of con­di­tions as well as, for the first time, cov­er­age for at­tempted sui­cide and ad­dic­tion dis­or­ders.</p>
    <p>How­ever, pre­mi­ums will “rise by up to 35 per cent for some”, as one head­line noted, and pol­i­cy­hold­ers will, on av­er­age – af­ter gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies are fac­tored in – pay 10 per cent more in pre­mi­ums for the first year.</p>
    <p>ARE HIGHER PRE­MI­UMS JUS­TI­FIED?</p>
    <p>The coun­cil has high­lighted that pay­outs have in­creased al­most 40 per cent over the last four years. But pre­mium col­lec­tion has also in­creased since 2016, as MediShield Life pre­mi­ums are higher than those for the pre­vi­ous MediShield scheme. It is the net ef­fect that is im­por­tant. Thus, it is dif­fi­cult to as­cer­tain whether the pro­posed higher pre­mi­ums are jus­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>What would have been help­ful would be to pro­vide the med­i­cal loss ra­tios (MLRs) for the four years since in­cep­tion.</p>
    <p>The MLR, a key met­ric for health in­sur­ers, is de­ter­mined by di­vid­ing the to­tal claims by the to­tal pre­mi­ums col­lected. If it is greater than 100 per cent, the in­surer has paid out more than it has col­lected, and over time, will be­come in­sol­vent.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a very low MLR may not nec­es­sar­ily mean the in­surer is charg­ing ex­ces­sive pre­mi­ums. In 2014, Dr Janil Puthuc­heary, now</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Health, clar­i­fied in Par­lia­ment when queried about why MediShield was pay­ing out only 44 cents in claims for ev­ery dol­lar of pre­mium col­lected, that this amount re­ferred only to di­rect claims in­curred for a par­tic­u­lar year.</p>
    <p>He ex­plained that if un­paid claims re­serves, change in con­tract re­serves (to ac­count for the value of fu­ture ben­e­fit pay­ments) and re­serves for con­tin­gent bene­fits were also in­cluded, MediShield’s MLR would have been a very re­spectable 96 per cent.</p>
    <p>In this era of trans­parency and greater cit­i­zen en­gage­ment, it would be valu­able to share sim­i­lar sta­tis­tics on the MLR as well as the Gov­ern­ment’s for­mu­las and as­sump­tions in work­ing out the amount set aside for claims re­serves and fu­ture bene­fits.</p>
    <p>GovTech in June or­gan­ised a “tear down” event to al­lay privacy con­cerns about the TraceTo­gether to­ken, invit­ing ex­perts to probe the to­ken and in­de­pen­dently pro­vide as­sess­ments. Per­haps MOH should do like­wise with MediShield Life, as pub­lic con­fi­dence in the fair­ness of its pre­mium set­ting is cru­cial.</p>
    <p>Sim­ply stat­ing, as the coun­cil did, that it was “ad­just­ing the pre­mi­ums this round as pro­posed by the ac­tu­ary”, is in­suf­fi­cient.</p>
    <p>What should have been elab­o­rated on also was the im­pact</p>
    <p>of low­er­ing the pro-ra­tion fac­tor for pri­vate hos­pi­tals from 35 per cent to 25 per cent. (The pro-ra­tion fac­tor in­volves bills from pri­vate hos­pi­tals be­ing pro-rated be­fore MediShield Life pay­outs are cal­cu­lated, to make them com­pa­ra­ble to those from a pub­lic hos­pi­tal, and en­sures pri­vate hos­pi­tal pa­tients do not re­ceive a larger pay­out.)</p>
    <p>In sim­ple terms, it means fewer MediShield Life dol­lars will be used to cover pri­vate hos­pi­tal bills, and the short­fall has to be made up else­where.</p>
    <p>This “else­where” is most likely to be the In­te­grated Plans (IPs) or pa­tients’ wal­lets. Two-thirds of Sin­ga­pore­ans have pur­chased IPs, and thus it is a mat­ter of pub­lic in­ter­est to know how low­er­ing the pro-ra­tion fac­tor will af­fect IP pre­mi­ums.</p>
    <p>CON­TROL­LING COSTS</p>
    <p>The coun­cil is to be com­mended for us­ing MediShield Life strate­gi­cally to fur­ther na­tional health­care trans­for­ma­tion ob­jec­tives.</p>
    <p>The rec­om­men­da­tions to in­crease claim lim­its for treat­ments out­side the area of acute hos­pi­tal stays – such as sub-acute care in com­mu­nity hos­pi­tals – and re­duce the de­ductible for older Sin­ga­pore­ans un­der­go­ing day surgery should en­cour­age more to seek care out­side the walls of the hos­pi­tal. This will help de­con­gest our very crowded acute hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>Th­ese mea­sures also help to con­trol costs, al­beit in­di­rectly, by shift­ing care to less ex­pen­sive fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The rec­om­men­da­tions – for which pub­lic con­sul­ta­tion is now open un­til Oct 20 – are sen­si­ble, but they don’t di­rectly ad­dress the ele­phant in the room, which is ris­ing health­care costs.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing this year’s Com­mit­tee of Sup­ply de­bate, Health Min­is­ter</p>
    <p>Gan Kim Yong re­vealed that Sin­ga­pore’s na­tional health ex­pen­di­ture in­creased from $13 bil­lion in 2012 to $22 bil­lion in 2017, a wor­ry­ing rise of 11 per cent per an­num.</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy has been dealt a body blow by Covid-19, our fun­da­men­tal health­care fi­nanc­ing chal­lenges con­tinue un­abated. The pop­u­la­tion con­tin­ues to age even as we are still wag­ing a war on di­a­betes, which af­fects many older adults.</p>
    <p>We need to be ruth­less as a coun­try in driv­ing cost-ef­ficiency and ensuring Sin­ga­pore­ans get the best value for their health­care dol­lar. What, then, can MediShield Life do?</p>
    <p>Well, MediShield Life has paid out an av­er­age of al­most</p>
    <p>$900 mil­lion a year, which makes it – other than the MOH, through sub­si­dies – the largest sin­gle payer of health­care in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Why should it not use its pur­chas­ing power to ob­tain bet­ter prices for all Sin­ga­pore­ans? Af­ter all, this is what in­sur­ers are sup­posed to do. AIA, one of the largest in­sur­ers here, as­sures its HealthShie­ld Gold Max pol­i­cy­hold­ers that they will “en­joy pre-ne­go­ti­ated con­sul­ta­tion fees” and have the abil­ity to “ef­fort­lessly se­cure an ap­point­ment within three work­ing days”.</p>
    <p>Within the pub­lic sec­tor, health­care lo­gis­tics firm Alps lever­ages the scale of its three pub­lic health­care clus­ter par­ents – the Na­tional Health­care Group, Na­tional Univer­sity Health Sys­tem and Sin­ga­pore Health Ser­vices – to ne­go­ti­ate bet­ter prices with phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal and med­i­cal de­vice man­u­fac­tur­ers.</p>
    <p>MediShield Life like­wise can, and should, be proac­tive in en­gag­ing health­care providers in both the pub­lic and pri­vate sec­tors to se­cure for Sin­ga­pore­ans the best rates pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>MediShield Life is a crit­i­cal pil­lar of Sin­ga­pore’s health­care fi­nanc­ing strat­egy. The re­view is timely and has high­lighted a num­ber of ar­eas to strengthen, but more can be done. Sin­ga­pore­ans need fur­ther pro­tec­tion against ris­ing health­care costs, and Sin­ga­pore as a na­tion needs to slow ris­ing health­care costs. MediShield Life can help ad­dress both is­sues.</p>
