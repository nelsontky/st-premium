    <p>Lawyer M. Ravi has filed a civil suit against the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral, two deputy at­tor­neys-gen­eral and five pros­e­cu­tors on be­half of a Malaysian drug run­ner who was spared the death penalty last month by the Court of Ap­peal.</p>
    <p>Gobi Ave­dian, 32, who was in­stead given 15 years’ jail and 10 strokes of the cane, is seek­ing un­spec­i­fied dam­ages from the de­fen­dants. In court pa­pers, he al­leged that the de­fen­dants had “abused their pow­ers and acted in bad faith by im­prop­erly per­form­ing a le­gal act which re­sulted in harm to the plain­tiff”.</p>
    <p>He also al­leged that the de­fen­dants had “breached their fun­da­men­tal du­ties to assist in the ad­min­is­tra­tion of jus­tice”.</p>
    <p>Nine de­fen­dants are named in the suit: the of­fice of the At­tor­neyGen­eral, cur­rent At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Lu­cien Wong, deputy at­tor­neysgen­eral Hri Ku­mar Nair and Lionel Yee, deputy chief prose­cu­tor Mo­hamed Faizal Mo­hamed Ab­dul Kadir, and pros­e­cu­tors Tan Zhong­shan, Ni­cholas Wuan, Chin Jincheng and Chong Kee En.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the At­tor­neyGen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC) con­firmed with The Straits Times that it has been served the court pa­pers. “The claims are with­out merit and we will de­fend them vig­or­ously,” said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>The Court of Ap­peal’s de­ci­sion last month was the re­sult of a change in le­gal po­si­tion last year on the doc­trine of wil­ful blind­ness, as well as a change in the pros­e­cu­tion’s case against Gobi at the trial and at the ap­peal.</p>
    <p>Wil­ful blind­ness is a le­gal term for the men­tal state of a per­son who sus­pects the truth but de­lib­er­ately re­fuses to in­ves­ti­gate fur­ther.</p>
    <p>Gobi was orig­i­nally charged over the im­por­ta­tion of 40.22g of heroin, af­ter he was caught at Wood­lands Check­point in 2014.</p>
    <p>He first avoided the death penalty in 2017 af­ter the High Court found that he did not know the na­ture of the drugs he was car­ry­ing and con­victed him of a lesser charge. In 2018, the apex court al­lowed the pros­e­cu­tion’s ap­peal and con­victed Gobi of the orig­i­nal cap­i­tal charge.</p>
    <p>Last year, in a sep­a­rate case, Nige­rian Adili Chibuike Ejike was spared the gal­lows upon ap­peal as he was found not to know about the pres­ence of drugs in his suit­case.</p>
    <p>In that case, the Court of Ap­peal held that wil­ful blind­ness is not rel­e­vant in con­sid­er­ing whether the pre­sump­tion of pos­ses­sion has been re­but­ted.</p>
    <p>Gobi, who was rep­re­sented by Mr Ravi, then asked the apex court to re­view its 2018 de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>Mr Ravi ar­gued that the rul­ing in Adili’s case should be ex­tended to the pre­sump­tion of knowl­edge of the na­ture of the drugs, which was the le­gal is­sue in Gobi’s case.</p>
    <p>The apex court agreed and quashed Gobi’s con­vic­tion on the cap­i­tal charge. It also held that the dif­fer­ent cases run by the pros­e­cu­tion were prej­u­di­cial to Gobi.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the judg­ment on Oct 19, Mr Ravi called the pros­e­cu­tors “overzeal­ous” in a video in­ter­view with al­ter­na­tive news site The On­line Cit­i­zen.</p>
    <p>The AGC’s re­but­tal was that the Court of Ap­peal ex­plic­itly pointed out that its de­ci­sion to con­vict Gobi was cor­rect at the time it was made.</p>
    <p>The AGC de­manded that Mr Ravi apol­o­gise and re­tract his com­ments. He did nei­ther.</p>
    <p>On Oct 23, the AGC said it had filed a dis­ci­plinary complaint to the Law So­ci­ety against Mr Ravi for pos­si­ble pro­fes­sional mis­con­duct.</p>
