    <p>Sun­tec Reit</p>
    <p>Sun­tec Real Es­tate In­vest­ment Trust’s (Sun­tec Reit) dis­tri­bu­tion per unit fell 21.9 per cent to 1.848 cents for its third quar­ter ended Sept 30, from 2.365 cents a year ago.</p>
    <p>This came as dis­tributable in­come from op­er­a­tions dropped 12.6 per cent year on year to $52.2 mil­lion, from $59.7 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>This was due to the ab­sence of con­tri­bu­tion from Sun­tec Sin­ga­pore and one-off com­pen­sa­tion re­ceived at Ma­rina Bay Fi­nan­cial Cen­tre prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>It was mit­i­gated by the bet­ter per­for­mance from the Aus­tralia of­fice port­fo­lio and of One Raf­fles Quay, and lower fi­nanc­ing costs, the Reit man­ager said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Gross rev­enue was down 13.4 per cent to</p>
    <p>$79.6 mil­lion for the quar­ter, from $91.9 mil­lion a year ago. Net prop­erty in­come fell 19 per cent on the year to $47.3 mil­lion for the quar­ter, from $58.4 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The dis­tri­bu­tion will be paid out on Nov 25.</p>
    <p>Alibaba Group Hold­ing has agreed to sub­scribe to more than a fifth of Ant Group’s im­mi­nent ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO), prop­ping up the po­ten­tial US$35 bil­lion (S$48 bil­lion) de­but of its part-owned fin­tech gi­ant.</p>
    <p>Asia’s largest cor­po­ra­tion will buy 730 mil­lion of about 1.67 bil­lion Shang­hai-listed A shares as part of a place­ment to strate­gic in­vestors, the e-com­merce gi­ant said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In­clud­ing the Hong Kong tranche of its IPO, Ant in­tends to sell a to­tal of 3.3 bil­lion shares.</p>
    <p>The fi­nan­cial ser­vices gi­ant plans to is­sue about 1.16 bil­lion Hong Kong-listed, or H, shares to Alibaba, part of a dis­tri­bu­tion of about 3.26 bil­lion shares to ex­ist­ing back­ers.</p>
    <p>Tesla on Wed­nes­day said prof­its in the past quar­ter more than dou­bled as the elec­tric car gi­ant fore­cast de­liv­er­ies hit­ting 500,000 this year.</p>
    <p>Net profit in the quar­ter rose to US$331 mil­lion (S$449 mil­lion), up from US$143 mil­lion a year ear­lier, as rev­enue rose nearly 40 per cent to US$8.7 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Tesla’s share price was up more than 3 per cent in after-hours trade on the re­sults.</p>
    <p>The com­pany de­liv­ered 139,000 ve­hi­cles in the past quar­ter, amid strong growth in its Model 3 car, the least ex­pen­sive in its line-up.</p>
    <p>Left: Fu­nan, one of the malls owned by Cap­i­taLand Mall Trust. The trust saw its gross rev­enue tum­ble 25.3 per cent to $150.3 mil­lion.</p>
