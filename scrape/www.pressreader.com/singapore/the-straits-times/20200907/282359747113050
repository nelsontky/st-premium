    <p>PARIS • Eng­land, world cham­pi­ons France, Euro­pean cham­pi­ons and ti­tle-hold­ers Por­tu­gal and Bel­gium all en­joyed win­ning starts to their Na­tions League top-tier cam­paign on Sat­ur­day, even if there were clear signs of rust fol­low­ing the coron­avirus shut­down.</p>
    <p>In Reyk­javik, the Three Li­ons needed a stop­page-time penalty by Ra­heem Ster­ling to beat Ice­land 1-0 in Group 2.</p>
    <p>It sal­vaged Eng­land from an­other em­bar­rass­ing re­sult against the Nordic side, whose 2-1 vic­tory in the last 16 of Euro 2016 re­mains one of foot­ball’s most fa­mous re­sults.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there was a huge slice of luck as Gareth South­gate’s men not only sur­vived go­ing down to 10 men af­ter Kyle Walker was sent off for two yel­low cards 20 min­utes from time, but saw Birkir Bjar­na­son blaze over a spot-kick soon af­ter Ster­ling’s suc­cess­ful ef­fort.</p>
    <p>All of Ice­land’s good work was un­done in the 89th minute when Sver­rir In­ga­son was harshly dis­missed for a sec­ond book­ing, lead­ing to Ster­ling’s penalty.</p>
    <p>But the drama did not end there as straight from the kick-off, Joe Gomez was ad­judged to have bun­dled over Holm­bert Frid­jon­s­son in­side the area, only for Bjar­na­son to miss.</p>
    <p>Ad­mit­ting his play­ers “got away with it”, Eng­land man­ager South­gate said: “It was an un­nec­es­sary red card.</p>
    <p>“We leave here with the win but a bit flat.”</p>
    <p>France saw off Swe­den by the same score­line, but it was just as un­con­vinc­ing with Kylian Mbappe scor­ing via their only shot on tar­get in their Group 3 clash in Solna.</p>
    <p>“It was a com­mit­ted match, not a great match,” said Les Bleus coach Di­dier Deschamps.</p>
    <p>“It was a good back-to-school game, con­sid­er­ing the fit­ness lev­els.”</p>
    <p>Por­tu­gal shrugged off the ab­sence of cap­tain Cris­tiano Ron­aldo to thrash Croa­tia 4-1, while world No. 1 Bel­gium came away from Den­mark with a 2-0 win.</p>
    <p>The Ju­ven­tus for­ward was miss­ing with an in­fected toe – caused by a bee st­ing, ac­cord­ing to Ital­ian me­dia – but the Sele­cao were still too good for their tired-look­ing Group 3 op­po­nents.</p>
    <p>Croa­tia are re­build­ing af­ter a string of in­ter­na­tional re­tire­ments fol­low­ing their ap­pear­ance at the 2018 World Cup fi­nal and were also miss­ing the vet­eran mid­field pair of skip­per Luka Mo­dric and Ivan Rakitic.</p>
    <p>Por­tu­gal took full ad­van­tage of their lack of ex­pe­ri­ence, hit­ting the wood­work three times and net­ting through Joao Cancelo, Diogo Jota, Joao Felix and An­dre Silva.</p>
    <p>“It has been a long time since we all got to­gether and some play­ers came straight from their va­ca­tion, but the team re­sponded well,” said Atletico Madrid for­ward Felix.</p>
    <p>Bel­gium also did not miss the pres­ence of star mid­fielder Kevin de Bruyne, who chose to ac­com­pany his wife as she gave birth to their daugh­ter and third child, whose name was re­vealed on In­sta­gram as Suri.</p>
    <p>The Red Devils handed the Danes, coached by Kasper Hjul­mand for the first time, a first home loss in four years via strikes by Ja­son De­nayer and Dries Mertens in Group 2.</p>
