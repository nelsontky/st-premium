    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s un­prece­dented de­mand that the United States get a cut of the pro­ceeds from the forced sale of Chi­nese In­ter­net gi­ant ByteDance’s Tik­Tok short-video app is based on an in­ter­pre­ta­tion of US law that reg­u­la­tory lawyers say may be open to chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>White House of­fi­cials on Tues­day also could not say how the US gov­ern­ment would re­ceive a por­tion of the pro­ceeds from any sale of Tik­Tok’s US oper­a­tions, one day af­ter Mr Trump called for a cut of the money.</p>
    <p>The Com­mit­tee on For­eign In­vest­ment i n the United States (CFIUS), a US gov­ern­ment panel that re­views deals for po­ten­tial na­tional se­cu­rity risks, has given ByteDance un­til Sept 15 to ne­go­ti­ate a sale of Tik­Tok to Mi­crosoft, amid con­cerns over the safety of per­sonal data that the app han­dles un­der its Chi­nese par­ent.</p>
    <p>Mi­crosoft has said it is seek­ing to buy the as­sets of Tik­Tok in North Amer­ica, Aus­tralia and New Zealand. It has not dis­closed how much it is will­ing to pay, though sources pre­vi­ously told Reuters that ByteDance ex­ec­u­tives value all of Tik­Tok at more than US$50 bil­lion (S$68.4 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>“A very sub­stan­tial por­tion of that price is go­ing to have to come into the Trea­sury of the United States be­cause we’re mak­ing it pos­si­ble for this deal to hap­pen,” Mr Trump told re­porters on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>CFIUS legislatio­n gives the US gov­ern­ment broad author­ity to seek mit­i­ga­tion from com­pa­nies that are jeop­ar­dis­ing na­tional se­cu­rity, le­gal ex­perts said.</p>
    <p>While CFIUS has never be­fore sought a cut from the pro­ceeds of a di­vesti­ture it has ordered, the White House could ar­gue that im­pos­ing a fee on ByteDance would de­prive it of re­sources that would other­wise sup­port China’s gov­ern­ment on tech­nol­ogy ini­tia­tives that could harm US in­ter­ests, some of the le­gal ex­perts added.</p>
    <p>“It’s cer­tainly in­con­sis­tent with the in­tent of Con­gress... and with CFIUS’ long­stand­ing con­cern to main­tain a rep­u­ta­tion for act­ing apo­lit­i­cally and solely on grounds of na­tional se­cu­rity, but it’s not clear that it’s out­side the Pres­i­dent’s statu­tory author­ity,” said Mr Paul Mar­quardt, a reg­u­la­tory lawyer at Cleary Got­tlieb.</p>
    <p>US law states that pres­i­den­tial de­ci­sions block­ing deals on na­tional se­cu­rity grounds are not sub­ject to ju­di­cial re­views.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a le­gal chal­lenge is pos­si­ble un­der the fifth amend­ment of the US Con­sti­tu­tion, which pro­hibits the gov­ern­ment from seiz­ing prop­erty with­out just com­pen­sa­tion, as well as un­der other laws, le­gal ex­perts said.</p>
    <p>While a pre­vi­ous fifth amend­ment chal­lenge to a CFIUS or­der had lim­ited suc­cess, this would be the first time a chal­lenge could be mounted against the US gov­ern­ment im­pos­ing a deal fee, the ex­perts added.</p>
    <p>“This is akin to the For­eign Cor­rupt Prac­tices Act but on US soil, where the US gov­ern­ment would be able to re­quire what is tan­ta­mount to a bribe in or­der to ob­tain a reg­u­la­tory ap­proval for a busi­ness trans­ac­tion,” DLA Piper lawyer Nicholas Klein said.</p>
    <p>It is not clear if Mr Trump will make good on his de­mand for a slice of the Tik­Tok deal pro­ceeds.</p>
    <p>“There’s no spe­cific blue­print here,” White House eco­nomic ad­viser Larry Kud­low said on Fox Busi­ness Net­work on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“It may be that the Pres­i­dent was think­ing, be­cause the Trea­sury has had to do so much work on this, there are a lot of op­tions here. I’m not sure it’s a spe­cific con­cept that will be fol­lowed through... Re­gard­ing fees or any­thing like that, all that re­mains to be seen,” Mr Kud­low said.</p>
    <p>White House spokesman Kayleigh McE­nany, speak­ing to re­porters at a sep­a­rate brief­ing, also gave no other de­tails and said she did not want to get ahead of Mr Trump on the is­sue. She re­it­er­ated that the US planned to take some ac­tion on Chi­nese-owned apps, in­clud­ing Tik­Tok, i n the com­ing days, but gave no de­tails.</p>
    <p>In its blog post, Mi­crosoft pledged to add more se­cu­rity, pri­vacy and dig­i­tal safety pro­tec­tions to the Tik­Tok app and en­sure that all pri­vate data of Amer­i­cans be trans­ferred back to the US and deleted from servers out­side the coun­try.</p>
