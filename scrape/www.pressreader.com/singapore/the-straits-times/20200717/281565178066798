    <p>The use of a new con­tact trac­ing de­vice and dig­i­tal check-in sys­tem for Covid-19 pa­tients is be­ing tri­alled by Sur­bana Jurong. The tech­nol­ogy could help min­imise in­fec­tion spread at work­sites and po­ten­tially re­place the con­tact trac­ing de­vice, TraceTo­gether to­ken, and dig­i­tal check-in sys­tem SafeEn­try at work­places.</p>
    <p>Sur­bana Jurong is tri­alling the use of a new con­tact trac­ing de­vice and dig­i­tal check-in sys­tem to have more vis­i­bil­ity and con­trol over the so­cial en­coun­ters of Covid-19 pa­tients to min­imise in­fec­tion spread at work­sites.</p>
    <p>The move is said to be nec­es­sary to avoid con­tribut­ing to an­other wave of in­fec­tions and busi­ness shut­downs.</p>
    <p>The tech­nol­ogy on trial is de­vel­oped by Te­masek Hold­ings-owned cryp­to­graphic tech­nol­ogy spe­cial­ist D’Crypt, and could po­ten­tially re­place the na­tional con­tact trac­ing de­vice TraceTo­gether To­ken and dig­i­tal check-in sys­tem SafeEn­try at work­places.</p>
    <p>In an ex­clu­sive in­ter­view with The Straits Times, Mr Wong Heang Fine, group chief ex­ec­u­tive of ur­ban and in­fra­struc­ture con­sul­tancy firm Sur­bana, said: “It is im­por­tant for com­pa­nies to have to­tal con­trol over the con­tact trac­ing process.”</p>
    <p>This in­cludes own­ing the data of peo­ple who had been in close con­tact with a Covid-19 pa­tient and the places the pa­tient had vis­ited so that po­ten­tially in­fected work­ers can be iso­lated quickly and tar­geted ar­eas can be closed off for sani­tis­ing with­out se­verely dis­rupt­ing op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>GovTech, which de­vel­oped the TraceTo­gether To­ken and SafeEn­try, does not pro­vide com­pa­nies with the data it col­lects, for con­fi­den­tial­ity rea­sons.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that the Health Min­istry takes about a day to in­form com­pa­nies of the po­ten­tially in­fected in­di­vid­u­als. As a pre­cau­tion, most firms quar­an­tine their en­tire fa­cil­ity while wait­ing for the in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>“If I need to quar­an­tine the whole work­site just to be safe, the fi­nan­cial im­pact will be huge,” said Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>The sen­ti­ment is shared by ST En­gi­neer­ing, whose 15,000 staff have down­loaded its in-house con­tact trac­ing app, AGIL Trace.</p>
    <p>The app was de­vel­oped “to ad­dress ur­gent needs for proac­tive and ef­fi­cient con­tact trac­ing dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic”, said a spokesman.</p>
    <p>“When the need arises, data can be ex­tracted and an­a­lysed for a faster... iden­ti­fi­ca­tion of close in­ter­ac­tions. This al­lows im­me­di­ate mit­i­ga­tion ef­forts to limit the spread of the virus and pro­tect em­ploy­ees.”</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal tools can quicken the con­tact trac­ing process to un­der two hours, a de­par­ture from the te­dious process of scan­ning closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion footage and in­ter­view­ing staff to map out who had been in close con­tact with a Covid-19 pa­tient con­firmed by the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Some 10,000 se­niors have re­ceived the first batch of TraceTo­gether To­kens, with the Gov­ern­ment plan­ning to is­sue more to broaden the use of the tool for more ef­fec­tive con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>So far, the TraceTo­gether app has been down­loaded by about 2.1 mil­lion peo­ple, short of the three-quar­ters of the pop­u­la­tion needed for it to work ef­fec­tively.</p>
    <p>The com­pa­nies’ con­tact trac­ing apps and wear­able de­vices, while lim­ited in scope, can still be ef­fec­tive as they are in sec­tors where the dis­ease trans­mis­sion risk is high.</p>
    <p>In the con­struc­tion sec­tor, for in­stance, work­ers live in com­mu­nal spa­ces and work in close prox­im­ity. In other com­pany set­tings, em­ploy­ees spend most of their time at work­sites.</p>
    <p>Even though for­eign work­ers are re­quired to down­load TraceTo­gether be­fore they can re­turn to work at their re­spec­tive con­struc­tion, marine ship­yard and process sec­tors, firms have no im­me­di­ate vis­i­bil­ity of the so­cial en­coun­ters of Covid-19-in­fected work­ers.</p>
    <p>This short­com­ing can be over­come if com­pa­nies buy or cre­ate their own con­tact trac­ing sys­tems.</p>
    <p>Over the past week, Sur­bana has been tri­alling D’Crypt’s BluePass and BlueGate tech­nolo­gies at a con­struc­tion work­site it man­ages in Tampines.</p>
    <p>More than 400 work­ers have been is­sued with a BluePass de­vice, which can be worn on the wrist or a lan­yard, or put in gar­ment pock­ets.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar to the TraceTo­gether To­ken, BluePass uses Blue­tooth sig­nal ex­changes to log nearby users ev­ery five to 10 min­utes. Each BluePass to­ken is linked to a con­tact num­ber and the last four char­ac­ters of the user’s NRIC, FIN or pass­port num­ber – all en­crypted on the de­vice.</p>
    <p>BlueGate is a ver­sion of BluePass con­nected to a power source and set to scan­ning mode at all times to record check-ins to premises.</p>
    <p>But un­like SafeEn­try, BluePass does not re­quire peo­ple to scan a QR code or fid­dle with their mo­bile phones. It au­to­mat­i­cally scans nearby BluePass de­vices and can be pro­grammed to beep when it de­tects unau­tho­rised en­tries.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said BlueGate will be use­ful when sep­a­rate teams of work­ers are not al­lowed to in­ter</p>
    <p>min­gle or en­ter non-des­ig­nated ar­eas. BlueGate can also be in­stalled in high-fre­quency ar­eas such as toi­lets and pantries where the risk of virus trans­mis­sion is higher.</p>
    <p>He hopes to roll out BlueGate and is­sue BluePass to some 30,000 work­ers at the 15 con­struc­tion sites Sur­bana cur­rently man­ages, as early as next month.</p>
    <p>Sur­bana also man­ages com­mu­nity care fa­cil­i­ties at Sin­ga­pore Expo and Big Box in Jurong for re­cov­er­ing Covid-19 pa­tients – where BluePass and BlueGate will be used.</p>
    <p>Other po­ten­tial uses in­clude Sur­bana-owned Ae­tos’ se­cu­rity op­er­a­tions at big events such as air shows or grand prix races.</p>
    <p>D’Crypt CEO Antony Ng said that if or­gan­i­sa­tions can take greater own­er­ship of the con­tact trac­ing process, they can help to re­duce the chances of an­other cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>D’Crypt is in dis­cus­sions to pilot its tech­nolo­gies in the petro­chem­i­cal, med­i­cal equip­ment man­u­fac­tur­ing, mar­itime and con­struc­tion in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>“Stu­dents can go back to school and eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties need not be dis­rupted,” said Dr Ng.</p>
    <p>He de­clined to dis­close the pric­ing of BluePass and BlueGate, but said it will not be “oner­ous”.</p>
