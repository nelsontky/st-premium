    <p>De­spite do­ing well in the Ex­press stream in sec­ondary school, Mrs Kousalya Sel­vaku­mar, 34, had to give up her stud­ies when she had her first child at the age of 16.</p>
    <p>She spent the next 14 years as a house­wife and stay-home mother to her four chil­dren.</p>
    <p>But on cel­e­brat­ing her 30th birthday, she de­cided it was time to look into ful­fill­ing her per­sonal and ca­reer as­pi­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>She loved car­ing for chil­dren and was pas­sion­ate about help­ing peo­ple. Af­ter some re­flec­tion and re­search into the of­fer­ings at the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion (ITE), she de­cided to en­rol in the twoyear Nitec course in nurs­ing.</p>
    <p>She was ner­vous about go­ing back to study­ing at 31, and won­dered if she could jug­gle car­ing for her fam­ily with full-time stud­ies.</p>
    <p>It helped that she had the full sup­port of her hus­band, Mr Chithravel Pandy, 46, an op­er­a­tions man­ager in a lo­gis­tics firm.</p>
    <p>He took on ex­tra du­ties around the home, in­clud­ing car­ing for the chil­dren when she was busy with her stud­ies.</p>
    <p>“I was torn and felt I was ne­glect­ing my kids, espe­cially when I had to go on ex­change pro­grammes. But they all kept telling me that they were okay and, be­sides, their dad was there.”</p>
    <p>ITE’s hands-on proach suited her.</p>
    <p>“I was very hes­i­tant when I started at ITE. I thought I was go­ing to feel out of place study­ing with a bunch of teenagers,” she said.</p>
    <p>“But ev­ery­thing just clicked af­ter a while. The com­bi­na­tion of the­ory and prac­tice was good, and soon I found my­self en­joy­ing my stud­ies.”</p>
    <p>Mrs Kousalya said there were sev­eral ma­ture stu­dents at ITE, espe­cially in nurs­ing, and it was in­spir­ing that many ex­celled and were top stu­dents.</p>
    <p>“I made many friends and I loved what I stud­ied. I had the op­por­tu­nity to travel abroad for sem­i­nars and ex­change pro­grammes in Hong Kong and the United States, where I got to see how healthcare is de­liv­ered and the role of nurses.</p>
    <p>“It was eye-open­ing.”</p>
    <p>She did so well that she made it to the Direc­tor’s List ev­ery se­mes­ter at ITE Col­lege East in Simei and grad­u­ated with a Cer­tifi­cate of Merit and grade point aver­age of 3.8, which qual­i­fied her to move on to the sec­ond year of the diploma in nurs­ing pro­gramme at Ngee learn­ing ap</p>
    <p>Ann Polytech­nic.</p>
    <p>She also re­ceived the Sinda Ex­cel­lence Award for ex­celling at ITE.</p>
    <p>Now in Ngee Ann Polytech­nic, she hopes to keep her grades up so that she can even­tu­ally go on to take a de­gree in nurs­ing and re­alise her am­bi­tion of be­com­ing a staff nurse in the pae­di­atric or gy­nae­co­log­i­cal field.</p>
    <p>“I still have some way to go, but I am de­ter­mined to keep on learn­ing. I had to give up my stud­ies to have my first son, but I al­ways felt that there was more I could achieve.</p>
    <p>“I am glad that I have had good op­por­tu­ni­ties at ITE and now at Ngee Ann Poly.”</p>
    <p>Her chil­dren – Suren­dra, 18, Dhan­vin, 10, Davitha, eight, and Vi­nayak, six – are proud of their mother.</p>
    <p>Suren­dra, who is cur­rently tak­ing the Nitec course in Web ap­pli­ca­tions at ITE, said of his mother: “She didn’t find it easy at first and was al­ways wor­ried if she was ne­glect­ing us, espe­cially when she went abroad on the ex­change pro­gramme. But we have all been push­ing her to keep at it.</p>
    <p>“For me, she has been such an in­spi­ra­tion. She worked so hard and did so well in ITE. Now, I feel like I have to fol­low suit and do as well.”</p>
