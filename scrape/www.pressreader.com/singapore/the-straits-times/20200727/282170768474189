    <p>A man took home bot­tles of hand sani­tiser placed inside a lift, which were meant for res­i­dents of a Bis­han Hous­ing Board block.</p>
    <p>On other oc­ca­sions, he emp­tied their con­tents onto the floor of the same lift.</p>
    <p>When con­fronted, Low Ken Lum claimed that he wanted to dis­in­fect the area.</p>
    <p>But in­ves­ti­ga­tions showed that he also tore posters placed inside the same lift, in­sist­ing they were not prop­erly af­fixed.</p>
    <p>The 50-year-old Sin­ga­porean was fined $4,000 on Fri­day af­ter plead­ing guilty to two counts of mis­chief.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Low had emp­tied a bot­tle of hand sani­tiser placed inside lift A at Block 182 Bis­han Street 23 at around 4.30pm on March 21. He dumped the con­tents on the floor.</p>
    <p>Low also tore down two posters from the lift wall and flung them onto the floor be­fore step­ping out of the lift.</p>
    <p>It emerged that Low com­mit­ted a sim­i­lar act in the same lift at around 11am six days later, Deputy Public Pros­e­cu­tor Tan Wee Hao said.</p>
    <p>It was not stated if he lives in the same block.</p>
    <p>Deputy Public Pros­e­cu­tor Tan Wee Hao told Dis­trict Judge Carol Ling on Fri­day that Low Ken Lum’s of­fences caused wrong­ful loss to the town coun­cil, which had to put up new posters, and the Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion as it had to re­place the hand sani­tiser bot­tles.</p>
    <p>Bis­han-Toa Payoh Town Coun­cil re­ceived mul­ti­ple feed­back re­ports in March about the posters and the dam­aged bot­tles of hand sani­tiser.</p>
    <p>Low’s acts were even­tu­ally cap­tured on a closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion cam­era, prompt­ing a town coun­cil of­fi­cer to alert the po­lice on April 1.</p>
    <p>Low ad­mit­ted dur­ing the in­ves­ti­ga­tion that he had also taken some sani­tiser bot­tles home for his own use.</p>
    <p>DPP Tan told Dis­trict Judge Carol Ling on Fri­day that Low’s of­fences caused wrong­ful loss to the town coun­cil, which had to put up new posters, and the Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion as it had to re­place the hand sani­tiser bot­tles.</p>
    <p>The DPP added that the four posters cost about $5 each, while the bot­tles of hand sani­tiser were of an un­known value.</p>
    <p>Low, who has made no resti­tu­tion, pleaded for le­niency yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>For each count of mis­chief, an of­fender can be jailed for up to two years and fined.</p>
