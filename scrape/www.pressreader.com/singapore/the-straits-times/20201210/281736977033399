    <p>LON­DON • As­traZeneca and Ox­ford Univer­sity have more work to do to con­firm if their Covid-19 vac­cine can be 90 per cent ef­fec­tive, a peer-re­viewed pa­per in The Lancet showed on Tues­day, po­ten­tially slow­ing its roll-out in the fight against the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Once seen as the front run­ner in the de­vel­op­ment of a vac­cine against the coro­n­avirus cri­sis, the Bri­tish team was over­taken by US drug­maker Pfizer, whose shots – with a suc­cess rate of around 95 per cent – were ad­min­is­tered to Bri­tish pen­sion­ers on Tues­day in a world-first hailed as V-Day.</p>
    <p>De­tailed re­sults from the As­traZeneca/Ox­ford vac­cine tri­als have been ea­gerly awaited.</p>
    <p>But the Lancet pub­li­ca­tion gave few ex­tra clues as to why ef­fi­cacy was 62 per cent for trial par­tic­i­pants given two full doses, but 90 per cent for a smaller sub-group given a half, then a full dose.</p>
    <p>“(This) will re­quire fur­ther re­search as more data be­comes avail­able,” the re­searchers said.</p>
    <p>Vi­rol­o­gist John Moore of Weill Cor­nell Med­i­cal Col­lege in New York said the team’s Lancet pa­per was “a hotch­potch of fac­toids and is hard to digest”.</p>
    <p>Asked if the half-, then full-dose reg­i­men, had been a mistake, Pro­fes­sor An­drew Pol­lard, di­rec­tor of the Ox­ford Vac­cine Group and chief in­ves­ti­ga­tor into the tri­als, said it had been “un­planned”.</p>
    <p>Less than 6 per cent of Bri­tish trial par­tic­i­pants were given the lower dose reg­i­men and none of them was over 55, so more stud­ies are needed to in­ves­ti­gate the vac­cine’s ef­fi­cacy in older peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“The im­por­tant thing to­day is that we have put all of our data into a pub­li­ca­tion in the Lancet which has been peer re­viewed and been through that sci­en­tific scru­tiny,” Prof Pol­lard said.</p>
