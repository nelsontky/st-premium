    <p>My kids and I are shoot­ing at zom­bies with Nerf guns. I miss my shots un­til I point my Nerf blaster, which fires foam darts, mere inches from the tar­gets. It is sat­is­fy­ing to take down en­e­mies, even those that can­not fight back.</p>
    <p>To win more points, we have to find a vac­cine (so far, so on trend) that will pro­tect us against the un­dead/Covid-19/2020.</p>
    <p>I run around like a head­less chicken un­til a voice mur­murs “look be­side you” and I pick up a rugby-shaped vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The game fa­cil­i­ta­tor uses the same low, in­sis­tent tones I em­ploy at trea­sure hunts at chil­dren’s par­ties, when urg­ing lit­tle ones to find ran­dom stuff I have hidden in front of their noses.</p>
    <p>The roles are re­versed at Nerf Ac­tion Xpe­ri­ence, an in­door play­ground in Ma­rina Square that wel­comes both chil­dren and adults.</p>
    <p>Here, my kids, aged 11 and seven, are the pros, while I am the kind of noob who calls IT sup­port when her lap­top is not con­nected to Wi-Fi. It is a con­fronta­tion with the lim­i­ta­tions of my age­ing body.</p>
    <p>Nerf Ac­tion Xpe­ri­ence of­fers far more than Nerf gun bat­tles. We move be­yond the Zombie City arena into the Con­quer zone, which fea­tures climb­ing walls, rope cour­ses and ob­sta­cle runs, which are a cou­ple of storeys above ground.</p>
    <p>We put on hel­mets and har­nesses, with a well-se­cured rope to tether us to safety.</p>
    <p>The Mis­sion: Im­pos­si­ble vibes evap­o­rate when I re­alise I can­not get past the climb­ing frames and webs with­out my fore­arms trem­bling with the un­ac­cus­tomed ex­er­cise. My palms turn too sweaty to hold fast to metal grips and han­dles.</p>
    <p>“Don’t look down,” the daugh­ter calls out.</p>
    <p>I look down. It is a mis­take. Perched on a ledge about 12m above ground, I am stuck be­tween an out­size net and an ob­sta­cle course with a skate­board at­tached to a tightrope.</p>
    <p>I know I am safe as houses, but, look­ing side­ways, I glimpse es­ca­la­tors scrolling up and down lazily, far be­low. Do I look like an es­capee from Cirque du Soleil?</p>
    <p>Phys­i­cal chal­lenges are sup­posed to help us over­come our fears. But I hug my fear like a chou­chou (a col­lo­quial term for a child’s some­times-stinky se­cu­rity blan­ket). I re­solve to never again spout guff about re­silience to my kids.</p>
    <p>I give up and turn back. But my 11-year-old son, Micah, com­pletes the course. I did not know I had birthed a would-be Olympian, but he brushes off my gushy mum praise.</p>
    <p>At the Chal­lenge zone, one test in­volves bash­ing through ob­sta­cles as quickly as pos­si­ble. I am soon face down in a foam pit, where I may have suf­fo­cated, al­beit very slowly, in a sea of soft, small pyra­mids. Luck­ily, I have the gump­tion to lift my head and con­tinue.</p>
    <p>I pre­fer an­other game from the tra­di­tional whack-a-mole genre. It in­volves bang­ing on big but­tons, which emit squeaks that sound like Stormtroop­er gun­fire from Star Wars.</p>
    <p>Like the other kids there, pinkcheeke­d from dash­ing around, my chil­dren love the in­door play­ground. I re­frain from mut­ter­ing darkly about how “child’s play” is a mis­nomer.</p>
    <p>True, I am a woman in mid­dle age who needs more ex­er­cise. But why does play have to be quite so full of ef­fort? Why do I have to chisel my mus­cles for fun?</p>
    <p>My child­hood mem­o­ries of play­ing zero point and Pepsi-Cola One Two Three burn ever brighter. I am glad I grew up in a gen­tler age.</p>

    <p>Pro tip: Con­cen­trate on putting one foot af­ter the other on the high-level rope cour­ses, rather than feel­ing over­whelmed when you look at how far you have to go. This ad­vice comes from my son, since I ab­jectly failed to con­quer this chal­lenge.</p>
