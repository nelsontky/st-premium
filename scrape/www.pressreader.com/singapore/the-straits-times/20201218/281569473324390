    <p>The Rus­sian flag and an­them will not be seen and heard at next year’s de­layed Tokyo Sum­mer Olympics and at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</p>
    <p>A Swiss court yes­ter­day up­held dop­ing sanc­tions against the coun­try but cut the orig­i­nal ban from four years to two. Still, Rus­sia’s ath­letes can com­pete as neu­trals.</p>
    <p>MOSCOW A Swiss court yes­ter­day up­held dop­ing sanc­tions that will pre­vent Rus­sian ath­letes from com­pet­ing at ma­jor in­ter­na­tional events un­der the coun­try’s flag, but halved the pe­riod of the ban to two from four years.</p>
    <p>The rul­ing will leave Rus­sian ath­letes with­out their flag and national an­them at next year’s post­poned Tokyo Olympics and at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, a se­vere blow to Rus­sian sport which has been hit in re­cent years by a string of dop­ing scan­dals.</p>
    <p>The World Anti-Dop­ing Agency (Wada) had orig­i­nally banned Rus­sia from the world’s top sport­ing events for four years in De­cem­ber, 2019, but the sanc­tion could not be im­ple­mented un­til the end of the ap­peal process.</p>
    <p>Rus­sian gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials or rep­re­sen­ta­tives will be banned from at­tend­ing events such as the Games and world cham­pi­onships in ma­jor sports for two years.</p>
    <p>Rus­sians will also not be able to be ap­pointed to com­mit­tees or serve as board mem­bers at or­gan­i­sa­tions that must abide by the Wada code.</p>
    <p>The Court of Ar­bi­tra­tion for Sport (CAS) said the sanc­tions, which also bar Rus­sia from host­ing or bid­ding for ma­jor sport­ing events dur­ing the two-year pe­riod, came into force yes­ter­day and will end on Dec 16, 2022. But hockey’s 2023 world cham­pi­onship, set to be held in St Peters­burg, falls out­side the scope of the ban.</p>
    <p>Rus­sian ath­letes will also still be al­lowed to par­tic­i­pate in events as neu­trals pro­vided Wada does not prove any link to the state-spon­sored dop­ing scheme.</p>
    <p>It was un­clear why the three­judge panel re­duced Rus­sia’s pun­ish­ment even as it largely agreed with Wada’s ar­gu­ments in the case. It stressed in its rul­ing that, while it was re­duc­ing the sanc­tions, Rus­sia should not at­tempt to claim its de­ci­sion as any kind of vin­di­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“This panel has im­posed con­se­quences to re­flect the na­ture and se­ri­ous­ness of the non-com­pli­ance and to en­sure that the in­tegrity of sport against the scourge of dop­ing is main­tained,” the panel’s mem­bers wrote.</p>
    <p>“The con­se­quences which the panel has de­cided to im­pose are not as ex­ten­sive as those sought by Wada. This should not, how­ever, be read as any val­i­da­tion of the con­duct of Rusada (Rus­sian Anti-Dop­ing Agency) or the Rus­sian au­thor­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>Wada was dis­ap­pointed the court had not en­dorsed all of its rec­om­men­da­tions but still pro­claimed a “land­mark” vic­tory.</p>
    <p>“Wada is pleased to have won this land­mark case,” said Wada pres­i­dent Wi­told Banka, adding that the ver­dict has “clearly up­held our find­ings that the Rus­sian au­thor­i­ties brazenly and il­le­gally ma­nip­u­lated the Moscow lab­o­ra­tory data in an ef­fort to cover up an in­sti­tu­tion­alised dop­ing scheme”.</p>
    <p>But Jim Walden, the lawyer for Rus­sian dop­ing whis­tle-blower Grig­ory Rod­chenkov, slammed CAS’ de­ci­sion, say­ing the tri­bunal was “un­will­ing and un­able to mean­ing­fully deal with sys­tem­atic and long-stand­ing crim­i­nal­ity by Rus­sia”.</p>
    <p>“The de­ci­sion by CAS to ef­fec­tively ‘split the baby’ is non­sen­si­cal and un­de­served,” he added, say­ing the rul­ing was made de­spite “over­whelm­ing proof” of cor­rup­tion and dop­ing fraud.</p>
