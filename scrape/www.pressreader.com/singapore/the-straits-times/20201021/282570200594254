    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Me­dia Fes­ti­val this year will be a mix of vir­tual and phys­i­cal pro­grammes as it aims to show­case Asian sto­ries to a global au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>Hosted by the In­fo­comm Me­dia Devel­op­ment Au­thor­ity (IMDA), the sev­enth edi­tion of the fes­ti­val, which fa­cil­i­tated $2.3 bil­lion worth of deals be­tween home-grown and in­ter­na­tional me­dia com­pa­nies from 2014 to last year, will re­turn this year from Nov 26 to Dec 6.</p>
    <p>It con­sists of the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Film Fes­ti­val (SGIFF), Asian Academy Cre­ative Awards (AAA), the Asia TV Fo­rum & Mar­ket (ATF) and ScreenSin­ga­pore as well as the in­au­gu­ral Su­perGamerFe­st.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Comic Con will be on hia­tus this year due to Covid-19 re­stric­tions on large-scale events.</p>
    <p>New to the fes­ti­val is the e-sports-fo­cused Su­perGamerFe­st – with events for the gam­ing com­mu­nity such as watch par­ties, vir­tual meet-and-greet ses­sions with pop­u­lar e-sports per­son­al­i­ties, mas­ter­classes and an awards show, the Su­perGamerFe­st Awards, to hon­our e-sports tal­ent in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>The SGIFF will run for the en­tire du­ra­tion of the Sin­ga­pore Me­dia Fes­ti­val and will com­bine vir­tual film screen­ings and phys­i­cal events.</p>
    <p>While its full line-up of films has yet to be un­veiled, its pro­gramme in­cludes a talk with Mr Shozo Ichiyama, vet­eran pro­ducer, founder and direc­tor of Tokyo Filmex film fes­ti­val. He has worked on beloved Asian movies such as Chi­nese film-maker Jia Zhangke’s A Touch Of Sin (2013) and Tai­wanese au­teur Hou Hsiaohsien’s Flow­ers Of Shang­hai (1998).</p>
    <p>SGIFF is also run­ning a New Waves pro­gramme be­fore the fes­ti­val to cel­e­brate women film-mak­ers. The line-up in­cludes short films by fe­male di­rec­tors and panel dis­cus­sions with women in film and it takes place on Oct 24 and 25 at the Old­ham Theatre. For more in­for­ma­tion, go to www.sgiff.com/newwaves.</p>
    <p>The AAA will hold its grand awards and gala event on Dec 3 and 4. Na­tional win­ners pre­vi­ously an­nounced last Thurs­day will rep­re­sent their coun­try at the grand awards cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore will be rep­re­sented by HBO Asia se­ries In­vis­i­ble Sto­ries’ Yeo Yann Yann com­pet­ing for Best Ac­tress and Au­gust Pic­tures’ Mind’s Eye for Me­di­a­corp com­pet­ing for Best Drama. Thriller Mind’s Eye is up against South Korea’s hit ro­mance se­ries Crash Land­ing On You.</p>
    <p>The event’s vir­tual red car­pet will be hosted by home-grown ac­tress Mu­nah Bagharib.</p>
    <p>This year’s ATF, a re­gional me­dia trade event, will move com­pletely on­line for its run from Dec 1 to 4 through its ATF On­line+ dig­i­tal plat­form. The four-day event will in­clude vir­tual trade mar­kets and con­fer­ences.</p>
    <p>Film mar­ket ScreenSin­ga­pore will also go on­line this year, con­nect­ing film-mak­ers and pro­duc­ers to po­ten­tial in­vestors and dis­trib­u­tors.</p>
