    <p>Are­cently an­nounced series of di­a­logues be­tween the pub­lic and pri­vate sec­tors on women’s is­sues, which will cul­mi­nate in a White Pa­per next year, comes at an ap­pro­pri­ate time. Ac­cord­ing to the United Na­tions Devel­op­ment Pro­gramme, women have been dis­pro­por­tion­ately af­fected by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic – from ex­pe­ri­enc­ing poorer health and ed­u­ca­tion, to be­ing bur­dened with more un­paid care work and fam­ily vi­o­lence. This lat­est ef­fort in Sin­ga­pore also comes on the heels of a spate of voyeurism cases at lo­cal uni­ver­si­ties, as well as pub­lic de­bate over a stu­dent who was given a com­mu­nity-based sen­tence – which would al­low him to have no crim­i­nal record – af­ter be­ing found guilty of chok­ing his ex-girl­friend.</p>
    <p>There should cer­tainly be more dis­cus­sion on whether stiffer penal­ties are needed for such of­fences. It would be a con­tin­u­a­tion of a jour­ney that started in 1961 with the pass­ing of the land­mark Women’s Char­ter, which pro­vided for monogamy and the rights and du­ties of mar­ried peo­ple; fol­lowed by amend­ments to the Crim­i­nal Pro­ce­dure Code and Ev­i­dence Act in 2018 to re­duce trauma in­flicted on vic­tims dur­ing the crim­i­nal jus­tice process. Changes to the Pe­nal Code last year re­pealed mar­i­tal im­mu­nity for rape, among other things. This year, changes to the Pro­tec­tion from Ha­rass­ment (Amend­ment) Act made it pos­si­ble for vic­tims to ob­tain pro­tec­tion or­ders against ha­rass­ment, stalk­ing and on­line bul­ly­ing.</p>
    <p>But while women here now en­joy bet­ter le­gal pro­tec­tion and are well rep­re­sented in pol­i­tics and se­nior man­age­ment, sig­nif­i­cant cul­tural, so­cial and struc­tural hur­dles re­main. The au­thor­i­ties’ lat­est – and more philo­soph­i­cal – ap­proach ac­knowl­edges that laws can only do so much for gen­der equal­ity. A shift in Sin­ga­pore’s value sys­tem is needed. So­ci­etal ex­pec­ta­tions that women should bear the lion’s share of care-giv­ing must evolve. Val­ues such as re­spect for women must also be in­ter­nalised by all boys and girls from a young age. Such a mind­set change would en­sure that sex­ual vi­o­lence, and dif­fer­en­tial treat­ment in the work­place based on gen­der, come to be seen as a deep vi­o­la­tion of fun­da­men­tal val­ues.</p>
    <p>As the late United States Supreme Court Jus­tice Ruth Bader Gins­burg said, women be­long in all places where de­ci­sions are be­ing made and it should not be that women are the ex­cep­tion.</p>
    <p>A so­ci­ety which does not recog­nise the equal po­si­tion of women can­not live up to its po­ten­tial. No amount of hard work or am­bi­tion can erase the stark choices be­tween work and fam­ily that con­front some women but not men. The out­come of the di­a­logue must go be­yond a White Pa­per to en­com­pass a lived re­al­ity where ev­ery woman and girl in Sin­ga­pore can achieve their fullest po­ten­tial. This is not a woman’s prob­lem, but a cul­tural, so­cial, eco­nomic and work­place chal­lenge that must be jointly tack­led by both men and women.</p>
