    <p>KIM SEEKS COM­PAS­SION</p>
    <p>FOR KANYE:</p>
    <p>Kim Kar­dashian (left) on Wed­nes­day asked for com­pas­sion and em­pa­thy for her rap­per hus­band Kanye West’s (above) strug­gles with bipo­lar dis­or­der, which have led to a se­ries of ram­bling pub­lic re­marks on sub­jects rang­ing from pol­i­tics to his mar­riage.</p>
    <p>Kar­dashian’s state­ment on Instagram was her first pub­lic com­ment on weeks of in­ter­views, pub­lic ap­pear­ances and Twit­ter posts by West that have raised con­cern about the</p>
    <p>Grammy-win­ning mu­si­cian’s men­tal health.</p>
    <p>“As many of you know, Kanye has bipo­lar dis­or­der,” she wrote, call­ing him a “bril­liant but com­pli­cated per­son”.</p>
    <p>Kar­dashian did not men­tion West’s stated plan to run for the White House in the Novem­ber elec­tion. West held a rally in South Carolina over the week­end un­der his self-styled Birth­day Party ban­ner, but has not out­lined any co­her­ent poli­cies.</p>
    <p>“Those who are close with Kanye know his heart and un­der­stand his words some­times do not align with his in­ten­tions,” Kar­dashian wrote.</p>
    <p>Her com­ments fol­lowed a se­ries of late-night tweets from West, in­clud­ing one in which he said he was try­ing to di­vorce Kar­dashian.</p>
    <p>The tweet in ques­tion was swiftly deleted.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple mar­ried in 2014 and have four chil­dren. Ear­lier this week, West tweeted that his fam­ily was try­ing to get him com­mit­ted to a psy­chi­atric in­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>The rap­per an­nounced his dis­or­der in 2018 and has in the past lamented that he feels med­i­ca­tion sti­fles his cre­ativ­ity. He was hos­pi­talised for psy­chi­atric treat­ment in 2016.</p>
    <p>Bipo­lar dis­or­der is a form of men­tal ill­ness char­ac­terised by unusual mood swings be­tween ex­treme en­ergy and ac­tiv­ity and de­pres­sion, ac­cord­ing to the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health. It can be treated with a com­bi­na­tion of med­i­ca­tion and ther­apy.</p>
    <p>Kar­dashian, a cos­met­ics busi­ness­woman who first found fame on re­al­ity-tele­vi­sion show Keep­ing Up With The Kar­dashi­ans, said she and her fam­ily were try­ing to get help for West. She also spoke about the stigma and mis­un­der­stand­ings around men­tal health.</p>
    <p>“Those that un­der­stand men­tal ill­ness or even com­pul­sive be­hav­iour know the fam­ily is pow­er­less un­less the mem­ber is a mi­nor,” she said.</p>
    <p>She said in­di­vid­u­als them­selves have to en­gage in the process of get­ting help, no mat­ter how hard oth­ers try.</p>
    <p>“I kindly ask that the me­dia and pub­lic give us the com­pas­sion and em­pa­thy that is needed so that we can get through this,” she added.</p>
