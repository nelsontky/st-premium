    <p>A spe­cial pay­out of $100 each will be made to about 10,000 stu­dents who re­ceive reg­u­lar help from The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund (STSPMF) to help them cope dur­ing the down­turn caused by the on­go­ing pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Fam­i­lies who have been hit hard by job cuts will also be given a hand, with the fund of­fer­ing as­sis­tance for three to six months. This is to en­sure that the chil­dren’s ed­u­ca­tion does not suf­fer while their par­ents are look­ing for work.</p>
    <p>Th­ese new moves are be­ing made as the fund – ini­ti­ated by ST jour­nal­ists on Chil­dren’s Day in 2000 as part of the news­room’s ef­forts to reach out to the com­mu­nity – marks its 20th an­niver­sary to­day.</p>
    <p>An­nounc­ing the ad­di­tional as­sis­tance, the fund’s chair­man, Mr War­ren Fer­nan­dez, said: “We know that th­ese are ex­cep­tion­ally dif­fi­cult times for many fam­i­lies so we are do­ing all we can to try to help.</p>
    <p>“We are able to do so only be­cause of the sup­port of our gen­er­ous donors who have stepped up in this time of great need.”</p>
    <p>The ad­di­tional help, he added, would come in handy for par­ents who need to pay for books and other ed­u­ca­tional needs at the end of the year.</p>
    <p>It would also help pre­vent chil­dren from hav­ing to go hun­gry if their par­ents are af­fected by the eco­nomic down­turn, said Mr Fer­nan­dez, who is ed­i­tor of The Straits Times and ed­i­tor-in­chief of Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings’ English/Malay/Tamil Me­dia Group.</p>
    <p>The monthly fi­nan­cial aid for pri­mary school pupils is $60 while those in sec­ondary school re­ceive $95. The as­sis­tance lasts for up to 24 months. Each post-sec­ondary stu­dent gets $120 a month, and is sup­ported for up to 48 months.</p>
    <p>Since ear­lier this year, the ST char­ity has taken steps to beef up fi­nan­cial aid for stu­dents whose fam­i­lies have been hit hard by the Covid-19 pan­demic. This year, ben­e­fi­cia­ries re­ceived $50 per month for two months – in May and July – on top of the reg­u­lar monthly aid that was given out.</p>
    <p>About 2,000 stu­dents have also been se­lected by schools and so­cial ser­vice agen­cies for a $500 egrant from the fund to buy prod­ucts from Chal­lenger or Har­vey Nor­man to help them with their home-based learn­ing.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, the fund has dis­bursed nearly $11 mil­lion this year to help ben­e­fi­cia­ries cope with the ex­traor­di­nary fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties wrought by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Over the past two decades, the fund has given out about $80 mil­lion to close to 180,000 stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan Bee Heong, gen­eral man­ager of the STSPMF, said the fund has re­ceived tremen­dous sup­port from the pub­lic this year, with more than $10 mil­lion in do­na­tions.</p>
    <p>The amount was the largest do­na­tion the fund has re­ceived since its in­cep­tion, she added.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Tan: “The school pocket money not only en­sures that our ben­e­fi­cia­ries do not go hun­gry in school and are able to fo­cus on their stud­ies, but it also gives their par­ents a sense of se­cu­rity and as­sur­ance that they do not have to worry about their chil­dren go­ing hun­gry in school. Par­ents are then able to fo­cus on re­solv­ing their other chal­lenges.”</p>
    <p>Since 2017, more than 250 main­stream schools have joined the fund as dis­burs­ing part­ners to give out school pocket money to their stu­dents.</p>
    <p>To reach out to stu­dents dur­ing the school hol­i­days this year, the STSPMF part­nered with the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion to pro­vide close to $2 mil­lion of a match­ing grant to sup­port about 45,000 stu­dents in May. The grant helped to pro­vide pocket money to stu­dents who needed to buy meals dur­ing the school hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>To adapt to the chang­ing needs of its ben­e­fi­cia­ries, Ms Tan said the fund con­ducts reg­u­lar re­views of the so­cial ser­vice land­scape to en­sure it stays rel­e­vant and re­spon­sive to needs on the ground.</p>
    <p>Some of the past re­views and ad­just­ments to the fund’s poli­cies in­cluded ad­just­ing the per capita in­come re­quire­ment and monthly school pocket money when the cost of liv­ing in­creased. In 2013, the fund was ex­panded to in­clude stu­dents in ju­nior col­leges, polytech­nics and the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Fer­nan­dez: “We are very grate­ful for the strong sup­port of our donors. Our aim is to en­sure we re­pay their kind­ness by do­ing as much as we pos­si­bly can for the kids and fam­i­lies who turn to us for help.”</p>
