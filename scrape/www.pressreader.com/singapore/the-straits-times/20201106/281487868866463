    <p>Karl Liew (left), the son of former Changi Air­port Group (CAG) chair­man Liew Mun Leong, ap­peared in a district court yes­ter­day, charged with giv­ing false in­for­ma­tion to a pub­lic ser­vant.</p>
    <p>Karl Liew, 43, is also ac­cused of giv­ing false ev­i­dence dur­ing a ju­di­cial pro­ceed­ing. He will be back in court on Dec 17.</p>
    <p>For giv­ing false in­for­ma­tion to a pub­lic ser­vant, an of­fender can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to $5,000.</p>
    <p>Of­fend­ers con­victed of giv­ing false ev­i­dence dur­ing a ju­di­cial pro­ceed­ing can be jailed for up to</p>
    <p>seven years and fined.</p>
    <p>Karl Liew is linked to a case in­volv­ing Ms Parti Liyani, 46, who used to work as a do­mes­tic helper for the older Mr Liew and his fam­ily from 2007 to 2016.</p>
    <p>She was later ac­cused of steal­ing more than $34,000 worth of items from the house­hold.</p>
    <p>The items in­cluded a $10,000 Ger­ald Genta watch, 115 items of cloth­ing worth $150 each as well as two iPhones with ac­ces­sories val­ued at more than $2,000 in to­tal.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments, Karl Liew al­legedly gave false in­for­ma­tion to As­sis­tant Su­per­in­ten­dent Tang Ru Long at around 8pm on Dec 10, 2016.</p>
    <p>He is ac­cused of telling ASP Tang in a state­ment that he had found 119 pieces of cloth­ing be­long­ing to him in­side boxes packed by Ms Parti.</p>
    <p>Karl Liew is also ac­cused of in­ten­tion­ally giv­ing false ev­i­dence in a ju­di­cial pro­ceed­ing be­fore District Judge Olivia Low at the State Courts on July 17, 2018.</p>
    <p>He al­legedly tes­ti­fied dur­ing the trial, while legally bound by an oath, that a cream polo T-shirt and a red blouse be­longed to him.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti was sen­tenced to two years and two months in jail in March last year.</p>
    <p>But Jus­tice Chan Seng Onn over­turned her con­vic­tion on four theft charges fol­low­ing an ap­peal in Septem­ber this year.</p>
    <p>Her lawyer, Mr Anil Balchan­dani, who acted pro bono, had ar­gued at her ap­peal that she was be­ing framed to pre­vent her from lodg­ing a complaint against the fam­ily for il­le­gal de­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Balchan­dani said that be­sides work­ing at the Chancery Lane fam­ily home, Ms Parti had also been told to clean the of­fice and home of Karl Liew.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan had found that there was an “im­proper mo­tive” on the part of the older Mr Liew and his son to pre­vent Ms Parti from com­plain­ing to the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam told Par­lia­ment in a min­is­te­rial state­ment on Wed­nes­day that the At­tor­neyGen­eral’ s Cham­bers (AGC) will, from this case here­after, se­ri­ously con­sider look­ing into al­le­ga­tions of per­jury or other se­ri­ous of­fences should such find­ings arise in court-is­sued judg­ments or de­ci­sions in le­gal pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on Wed­nes­day evening, the po­lice said: “Fol­low­ing the re­lease of the High Court judg­ment and in the light of the High Court’s com­ments, the AGC di­rected the po­lice to con­duct fur­ther in­ves­ti­ga­tions with a view to as­sess if any of­fences have been com­mit­ted by the Liews.”</p>
    <p>The po­lice added that they have com­pleted their in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Karl Liew, who is rep­re­sented by lawyer Adam Ma­niam from Drew & Napier, was ex­pres­sion­less as he stood in the dock at around 9.30am yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ac­com­pa­nied by his le­gal team and an uniden­ti­fied woman, he left the State Courts build­ing at around 11am and en­tered a black BMW car.</p>
    <p>All of them de­clined to com­ment when The Straits Times ap­proached them.</p>
    <p>The key ques­tion is whether the case was han­dled dif­fer­ently be­cause of the sta­tus of the com­plainant, or if there has been any im­proper in­flu­ence.</p>
    <p>Did Mr Liew Mun Leong in any way in­flu­ence these pro­ceed­ings? Or was the case in­ves­ti­gated and pros­e­cuted in ac­cor­dance with the rules like any other case? I have said it ear­lier, and I will re­it­er­ate. I can be cat­e­gor­i­cal. There was no in­flu­ence by Mr Liew. It was treated as any other theft case and han­dled ac­cord­ingly.</p>
    <p>This case is in fact an il­lus­tra­tion of how the rule of law ap­plies. A for­eign do­mes­tic worker is charged. The High Court ac­quits her. The com­plainant is a wealthy, pow­er­ful per­son. But all are equal be­fore the law. It doesn’t mat­ter who the par­ties are. (They re­ceive) jus­tice ac­cord­ing to the facts and the law as the courts see it.</p>
    <p>We may agree or dis­agree with the State Courts’ or High Court’s de­ci­sions and con­clu­sions. But that is a dif­fer­ent mat­ter.</p>
    <p>CRIM­I­NAL JUS­TICE SYS­TEM</p>
    <p>If you look at a sys­temic level, at the high­est level, you talk about “the crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem”.</p>
    <p>We have the po­lice who in­ves­ti­gate in ac­cor­dance with the le­gal frame­work for po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions. The At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC) makes the charg­ing de­ci­sion based on (1) avail­able ev­i­dence; and (2) pub­lic in­ter­est. The trial courts con­sider the suf­fi­ciency of the ev­i­dence and the le­gal is­sues. The ap­pel­late courts re­view the de­ci­sion of the trial court.</p>
    <p>This case shows that the crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem as a whole works.</p>
    <p>If you drill down to the next level, we have “sys­tems”. For ex­am­ple, these would com­prise in­ves­tiga­tive pro­to­cols, stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures for how the po­lice and deputy pub­lic pros­e­cu­tors op­er­ate. I have men­tioned some er­rors that were made; we have to try to strengthen the sys­tems at that level and try to pre­vent a re­oc­cur­rence. I have also men­tioned the chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>Be­sides these lev­els to the sys­tem, there will al­ways be the risk of mis­takes by in­di­vid­u­als. These lapses will have to be dealt with. The idea of rule of law is cen­tral to our ideas of fair­ness, equal­ity and jus­tice. It is even more im­por­tant in the cur­rent zeit­geist that is sweep­ing through coun­tries.</p>
    <p>So­ci­eties around the world are grap­pling with de­bates on in­equal­ity. (There is) a sense that the elite are cream­ing off most of the eco­nomic ben­e­fits and bend­ing the rules and sys­tems to their own ad­van­tage, and in the process, buy­ing off and sub­orn­ing those in gov­ern­ment. Peo­ple are fed up with un­fair struc­tures.</p>
    <p>Equal op­por­tu­ni­ties are dry­ing up.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, we are not in the same sit­u­a­tion. Our ac­tive in­ter­ven­tion in so­cioe­co­nomic is­sues has helped most peo­ple to ben­e­fit. But our peo­ple know we must jeal­ously guard the avail­abil­ity of equal op­por­tu­ni­ties. We must en­sure that ev­ery­one has a fair shake. We must be alert and guard against the wealthy and the pow­er­ful tak­ing un­fair ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>If a sig­nif­i­cant sec­tion of our peo­ple feel that the sys­tem favours some, or that it is un­fairly stacked against them, then Sin­ga­pore will lose its co­he­sion and it can’t suc­ceed. Thus it is es­sen­tial that we have a fair sys­tem, that we have a clean sys­tem, that we have a sys­tem that gives op­por­tu­ni­ties to all.</p>
    <p>These are our fun­da­men­tal con­cerns. If Mr Liew did un­fairly in­flu­ence the pro­ceed­ings, then it will be a hit to our foun­da­tions. It will be a hit to our sense of fair­ness, equal­ity, jus­tice, and a dent to Project Sin­ga­pore it­self, be­cause Sin­ga­pore is built on these ideals.</p>
    <p>We have al­ways been jealous about guard­ing against such cor­ro­sion. It does not mean there will be no abuse of power and no cor­rup­tion. But when it hap­pens, swift, de­ci­sive ac­tion must be taken. MPs will know that suc­ces­sive gov­ern­ments have been clear about this.</p>
    <p>CASES OF COR­RUP­TION</p>
    <p>There has to be a ruth­less in­ten­sity in up­hold­ing in­tegrity. Found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew set the tone. The case of Mr Teh Cheang Wan is a prime ex­am­ple of that ap­proach.</p>
    <p>He was one of the most se­nior mem­bers in Mr Lee’s Cab­i­net. But when cor­rup­tion al­le­ga­tions sur­faced, Mr Lee di­rected the Cor­rupt Prac­tices In­ves­ti­ga­tion Bureau (CPIB) to con­duct in­ves­ti­ga­tions. Mr Teh was placed on leave of ab­sence. He ul­ti­mately chose to end his life rather than face trial or cor­rup­tion charges which the AGC had (then) yet to set­tle.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said at that time: “There is no way a min­is­ter can avoid in­ves­ti­ga­tions, and a trial if there is ev­i­dence to sup­port one.”</p>
    <p>These were the val­ues of our found­ing gen­er­a­tion. And these are, and have to be, our con­tin­u­ing val­ues.</p>
    <p>They have been scrupu­lously stressed and ad­hered to by the two suc­ceed­ing prime min­is­ters. They are like re­li­gious com­mand­ments. There can­not be any com­pro­mise. Where there is a breach, ac­tion is taken. Ac­tion will be taken.</p>
    <p>Let me re­fer to some cases. In 2012, you had:</p>
    <p>Mr Peter Lim, Com­mis­sioner of the Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force (SCDF). In fact, he was Com­mis­sioner of SCDF when I was Min­is­ter of Home Af­fairs. He was con­victed of cor­rup­tion charges for re­ceiv­ing sex­ual favours with three dif­fer­ent women. He was sen­tenced to six months’ im­pris­on­ment, and was dis­missed from pub­lic ser­vice fol­low­ing dis­ci­plinary pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>In 2013, you had CPIB as­sis­tant di­rec­tor Ed­win Yeo mis­ap­pro­pri­at­ing money. He was jailed for 10 years for crim­i­nal breach of trust as a pub­lic ser­vant and for forgery. In 2007, you had Mr T.T. Du­rai, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Na­tional Kid­ney Foun­da­tion. He was con­victed of cor­rup­tion and sen­tenced to im­pris­on­ment. He ap­pealed to the High Court but (the ap­peal) was dis­missed. In 2012, Mr Howard Shaw, then ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Sin­ga­pore En­vi­ron­ment Coun­cil, was con­victed of ob­tain­ing com­mer­cial sex with mi­nors. He had asked for a nom­i­nal fine based on tes­ti­mo­ni­als of his good char­ac­ter and so­cial stand­ing. The court found no ex­cep­tional cir­cum­stances and sen­tenced him to 12 weeks’ im­pris­on­ment. The sen­tence was to pro­vide a strong de­ter­rence to oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim was a se­nior Home Team of­fi­cer. In many coun­tries, his ac­tions would not have at­tracted crim­i­nal pun­ish­ment. In most coun­tries, com­mis­sion­ers of SCDF and as­sis­tant di­rec­tors of CPIB are pretty much un­touch­able. But not in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>GUARD AGAINST IN­FLU­ENCE PED­DLING</p>
    <p>The mes­sage is, it doesn’t mat­ter who you are. If you do wrong, ac­tion will be taken. But it is not only cor­rup­tion that we must guard against. We must also guard against soft cor­rup­tion and in­flu­ence ped­dling. Let me quote what Mr Lee Kuan Yew and</p>
    <p>Dr Goh Keng Swee have said. In 1984, Mr Lee said, and I quote: “We ex­er­cised power as trustees for the peo­ple, with an abid­ing sense of our fidu­ciary re­spon­si­bil­ity. Our hon­our, our sense of duty made us ex­er­cise power scrupu­lously. We have curbed, re­strained, pre­vented any dis­tor­tion of poli­cies which would have been in­evitable, if the per­sonal in­ter­ests of the few</p>
    <p>in charge were al­lowed full rein. This is the case in many new coun­tries.”</p>
    <p>“When those in of­fice re­gard the power vested in them as a per­sonal pre­rog­a­tive, they in­evitably en­rich them­selves, pro­mote their fam­i­lies, favour their friends. The fun­da­men­tal struc­tures of the mod­ern state are eroded, like the sup­port­ing beams of a house af­ter ter­mites have at­tacked them. Then the peo­ple have to pay dearly and long for the sins and crimes of their lead­ers.”</p>
    <p>And as early as 1961, Dr Goh warned about the risks that groups of elites might cre­ate an en­vi­ron­ment that would favour one com­mu­nity at the ex­pense of an­other.</p>
    <p>In an ar­ti­cle in the Nanyang Univer­sity journal in 1961, he said, and I quote:</p>
    <p>“To achieve an hon­est and en­er­getic ad­min­is­tra­tion ap­pears easy in the­ory. In prac­tice, very few of the young and emer­gent na­tions have achieved this. Even in the most ad­vanced and lead­ing so­ci­eties, whether com­mu­nist or demo­cratic, the prob­lem of nepo­tism is a re­cur­ring one and can only be coun­tered by con­stant vig­i­lance.</p>
    <p>“In ad­vanced so­ci­eties, it is not so much open nepo­tism that is to be feared, but the in­sid­i­ous ‘old boy’ type whereby no il­le­gal­i­ties are com­mit­ted, but in which the pin­na­cles of power, in­flu­ence and wealth are the re­serve of those born into the right fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>“In un­der­de­vel­oped coun­tries, the mat­ter could be more se­ri­ous. A sys­tem may arise in which the dom­i­nant ma­jor­ity, whether of fam­i­lies, clans or even en­tire com­mu­ni­ties, ar­ro­gates to it­self not only the open­ings to the seats of power, but also the av­enues by which in­di­vid­u­als can fit them­selves out for such po­si­tions of power. The dom­i­nant ma­jor­ity is thus able to point out that those out­side of the charmed cir­cle just do not have the nec­es­sary qual­i­fi­ca­tions to be ad­mit­ted to this elite group.</p>
    <p>“Thus many able and as­pir­ing peo­ple are de­nied the op­por­tu­nity for the full use of their abil­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>I per­son­ally find these words, very pow­er­ful, in­sight­ful, and I have more than once quoted the speech of Dr Goh in my own speeches be­cause Dr Goh has, I think, iden­ti­fied pre­cisely a se­ri­ous, in­sid­i­ous risk in any so­ci­ety, in­clud­ing ours.</p>
    <p>We are not that spe­cial that we can be im­mune to these risks. We have to con­stantly make sure that we don’t al­low it. We have to be very care­ful, to try to stamp it out wher­ever it ap­pears. And make no mis­take, make no mis­take – it will keep ap­pear­ing in big and small ways.</p>
    <p>LET­TER FROM PM TO MPS</p>
    <p>This is again some­thing suc­ces­sive prime min­is­ters have been vig­i­lant about. One il­lus­tra­tion of that is the let­ter that the prime min­is­ter sends out at the start of each new term of this House. Most mem­bers are aware of the let­ter.</p>
    <p>I quote parts:</p>
    <p>“The con­text each time may be dif­fer­ent, but the sub­ject re­mains con­stant. In­tegrity, hon­esty and in­cor­rupt­ibil­ity are fun­da­men­tal. We must never tire of re­mind­ing our­selves of their im­por­tance. One vi­tal fac­tor to re­tain the trust of Sin­ga­pore­ans all these years is hon­esty and in­tegrity. The rep­u­ta­tion for clean, in­cor­rupt­ible gov­ern­ment is one of our most pre­cious as­sets.</p>
    <p>“I can­not stress strongly enough ev­ery MP must up­hold the rig­or­ous stan­dards we have set for our­selves. Do noth­ing to com­pro­mise them. Never give cause for al­le­ga­tions that you are mis­us­ing your po­si­tion, es­pe­cially your ac­cess to min­is­ters.</p>
    <p>“A few will cul­ti­vate you to ob­tain ben­e­fits for them­selves or their com­pa­nies, to gain re­spectabil­ity by as­so­ci­a­tion with you, or to get you to in­flu­ence min­istries and statu­tory boards to make de­ci­sions in their favour. Per­sonal favours big and small are just some of the count­less so­cial lu­bri­cants which such peo­ple use to in­gra­ti­ate them­selves to MPs and make you obliged to them.</p>
    <p>“At all times be seen to be be­yond the in­flu­ence of gifts or favours. Sep­a­rate your pub­lic po­lit­i­cal po­si­tion from your pri­vate, pro­fes­sional or busi­ness in­ter­ests. MPs who are in busi­ness, who oc­cupy se­nior man­age­ment po­si­tions in com­pa­nies, or who sit on com­pany boards should be es­pe­cially vig­i­lant.</p>
    <p>“You must not ex­ploit your pub­lic po­si­tion as gov­ern­ment MPs, your close con­tacts with the min­is­ters, or your ac­cess to gov­ern­ment de­part­ments and civil ser­vants, for your per­sonal in­ter­est or the ben­e­fit of your em­ploy­ers. Your con­duct must be al­ways above board. We have held our po­si­tion be­cause our in­tegrity has never been in doubt. Al­ways con­duct your­selves with mod­esty, deco­rum and dig­nity.”</p>
    <p>I can tell MPs this is all not just nice-sound­ing ad­vice. Even be­fore it reaches the kind of con­duct re­ferred to in the prime min­is­ter’s let­ter, if we feel that there is some con­duct that re­quires a closer look, we do take a closer look.</p>
    <p>I am re­fer­ring here to con­duct which is not crim­i­nal, nor a breach of ethics, but which in our view should be avoided. Some­thing that may be le­gal but, for ex­am­ple, could lead even­tu­ally to some­thing which is not of so good odour.</p>
    <p>When we sense that, I usu­ally</p>
    <p>have a chat with the rel­e­vant MP. They come and have a cup of cof­fee with me. When they leave, the is­sue is usu­ally re­solved. And if it is not re­solved, then they don’t re­main as MPs. But don’t worry, it doesn’t hap­pen ev­ery time peo­ple come and have cof­fee with me.</p>
    <p>If it is crim­i­nal, of course there will be pros­e­cu­tion. And there have been MPs and former MPs who have been pros­e­cuted. And if there are breaches of other rules, the re­spec­tive pro­fes­sional or reg­u­la­tory bod­ies will take ac­tion, as they have done. We don’t in­ter­vene or try to stop any of this.</p>
    <p>I have dealt with this at some length be­cause we must un­der­stand these are fun­da­men­tal val­ues. If we don’t keep them, we will be in trou­ble. In Sin­ga­pore, in this con­text, we have a more chal­leng­ing en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>We are a small place. A lot of peo­ple know each other. (There are) many ed­u­ca­tional, pro­fes­sional, work-re­lated and so­cial fam­ily con­nec­tions – same schools, col­leges, uni­ver­si­ties, time spent in na­tional ser­vice, other con­nec­tions. Peo­ple in­ter­act with each other fre­quently.</p>
    <p>We try to look for peo­ple on the ba­sis of merit. And they will of­ten, be­cause of their ca­reers and ed­u­ca­tion, have deep con­nec­tions with many oth­ers whom they in­ter­act with. The way we han­dle this is to make sure the per­sons ap­pointed are men and women of char­ac­ter. That they have the moral fi­bre to do the right thing.</p>
    <p>Our small size means these con­nec­tions and in­ter­ac­tions are in­evitable.</p>
    <p>And so, we will al­ways have to be very care­ful. Al­ways re­mem­ber, we are fidu­cia­ries. This is a sa­cred trust. We do this for the peo­ple. We do the right thing. Do not al­low any cor­ro­sion of pub­lic in­ter­est. Act with hon­our. Be wor­thy of the trust peo­ple have re­posed in us.</p>
    <p>It is crit­i­cal that what­ever the re­la­tion­ship, the Gov­ern­ment main­tains high stan­dards of pro­bity, of con­duct, so that de­ci­sions are made on ob­jec­tive and im­par­tial as­sess­ment.</p>
    <p>And have we lived up to those stan­dards? MPs can ask that ques­tion hon­estly. What is the lived re­al­ity for Sin­ga­pore­ans? How much cor­rup­tion do peo­ple encounter here?</p>
    <p>We rank highly on cred­i­ble in­ter­na­tional in­dices for ab­sence of cor­rup­tion, for rule of law, for the way our sys­tem func­tions cleanly. This is a coun­try known for all this – and that con­tin­ues to be the case.</p>
    <p>WHEN THE SYS­TEM GOES AWRY</p>
    <p>What hap­pens if you al­low the sys­tem to go awry? What hap­pens when you al­low in­flu­ence ped­dling? What hap­pens when you al­low cor­rup­tion, abuse of</p>
    <p>po­si­tion and abuse of power?</p>
    <p>Let me give you a cou­ple of ex­am­ples.</p>
    <p>First, the United States. In­flu­ence ped­dling has be­come part and par­cel of pol­i­tics and gov­er­nance. The US Supreme Court has said that “in­gra­ti­a­tion and ac­cess em­body a cen­tral fea­ture of democ­racy”. (It is) not against the law for of­fi­cials to set up meet­ings, host events and call other of­fi­cials on be­half of lob­by­ists. Big busi­nesses ex­ten­sively lobby reg­u­la­tors, us­ing middlemen.</p>
    <p>I per­son­ally think this is not good for the healthy func­tion­ing of so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Lob­by­ing it­self is a mas­sive busi­ness. Big Pharma, for ex­am­ple, spent US$4.45 bil­lion (S$6.03 bil­lion) on lob­by­ing alone, over the last 22 years. And it works. One study found that reg­u­la­tors were 45 per cent less likely to ini­ti­ate en­force­ment ac­tion against banks that lobby, ver­sus banks that don’t.</p>
    <p>The ex­pe­ri­ence of South Africa of­fers an­other ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>In South Africa, “state cap­ture” is a buzz­word be­cause of how pri­vate in­ter­ests have ex­erted in­flu­ence over gov­ern­ment de­ci­sion mak­ing and used this in­flu­ence to plun­der the state. Cor­rup­tion scan­dals in­volv­ing the former pres­i­dent and the Gupta brothers are the most fa­mous ex­am­ples. It is, of course, an ex­treme ex­am­ple of the sys­tem go­ing awry.</p>
    <p>Crit­i­cal ques­tion for us: How do we en­sure that the sys­tem stays clean? That we don’t al­low what Mr Lee and Dr Goh warned against?</p>
    <p>We have a me­dia that high­lights these is­sues. See the num­ber of ar­ti­cles that have ap­peared in this mat­ter in the Sin­ga­pore me­dia. Ac­count­abil­ity – a well-ed­u­cated, aware pop­u­la­tion that holds us ac­count­able. And Par­lia­ment, where we have these is­sues to be openly dis­cussed, de­bated. All these are es­sen­tial.</p>
    <p>But these fac­tors are also present in many coun­tries where in­flu­ence ped­dling is nev­er­the­less a cancer.</p>
    <p>We have avoided that slip­pery path, be­cause in ad­di­tion to the above, we have had in our three prime min­is­ters the strong will to en­sure a clean sys­tem and the de­ci­sive­ness to act when some­thing goes wrong. Al­ways, al­ways – re­gard­less of your rules, and re­gard­less of your sys­tems – the rot starts at the top. If the top is clean, the sys­tem can work well. And we’ve got to make sure of that. And if it starts, then very few things can save such a coun­try.</p>
    <p>In this case, if we had seen any­thing wrong by way of in­flu­ence ped­dling, swift, open, trans­par­ent ac­tion would have been taken.</p>
