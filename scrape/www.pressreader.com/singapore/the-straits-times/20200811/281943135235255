    <p>BEIRUT • Lebanon’s Prime Min­is­ter an­nounced the res­ig­na­tion of his gov­ern­ment yes­ter­day, af­ter last week’s dev­as­tat­ing ex­plo­sion in Beirut that has stirred pub­lic out­rage and spurred a string of ministers to step down.</p>
    <p>The Aug 4 port ware­house det­o­na­tion of more than 2,000 tonnes of am­mo­nium ni­trate killed at least 163 peo­ple, in­jured more than 6,000 and de­stroyed swathes of the bustling Mediter­ranean cap­i­tal, com­pound­ing months of po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic melt­down.</p>
    <p>The Cab­i­net, formed in Jan­uary with the back­ing of the pow­er­ful Ira­nian-backed Hizbol­lah group and its allies, met yes­ter­day, with many ministers want­ing to resign, ac­cord­ing to min­is­te­rial and po­lit­i­cal sources.</p>
    <p>In an ad­dress to the na­tion last night, Prime Min­is­ter Has­san Diab said the Beirut blast was the re­sult of en­demic cor­rup­tion. “We are with the peo­ple in call­ing for try­ing those re­spon­si­ble for this crime,” Mr Diab said as he an­nounced his gov­ern­ment’s res­ig­na­tion.</p>
    <p>For many or­di­nary Le­banese, the ex­plo­sion was the last straw in a pro­tracted cri­sis over the col­lapse of the econ­omy, cor­rup­tion, waste and dys­func­tional gov­er­nance, and they have taken to the streets de­mand­ing root-and-branch change.</p>
    <p>In­for­ma­tion Min­is­ter Manal Ab­del Sa­mad and En­vi­ron­ment Min­is­ter Dami­anos Kat­tar quit on Sun­day, as well as sev­eral law­mak­ers. Jus­tice Min­is­ter Marie Claude Na­jem fol­lowed them out the door yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Fi­nance Min­is­ter Ghazi Wazni, a key ne­go­tia­tor with the In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund over a res­cue plan to help Lebanon exit a fi­nan­cial cri­sis, pre­pared his res­ig­na­tion let­ter and took it with him to the Cab­i­net meet­ing, a source close to him and lo­cal me­dia said.</p>
    <p>Lebanon’s Pres­i­dent Michel Aoun had pre­vi­ously said ex­plo­sive ma­te­rial was stored un­safely for years at the port. He later said the in­ves­ti­ga­tion would con­sider whether the cause was ex­ter­nal in­ter­fer­ence as well as neg­li­gence or an ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Anti-gov­ern­ment protests in the past two days have been the big­gest since Oc­to­ber, when an­gry demon­stra­tions spread over an eco­nomic cri­sis rooted in per­va­sive graft, mis­man­age­ment and high-level un­ac­count­abil­ity. Protesters ac­cused the po­lit­i­cal elite of si­phon­ing off state re­sources for their own ben­e­fit.</p>
    <p>“The en­tire regime needs to change. It will make no dif­fer­ence if there is a new gov­ern­ment,” Mr Joe Had­dad, an en­gi­neer, told Reuters. “We need quick elec­tions.”</p>
    <p>Mr Eli Abi Hanna’s house and his car re­pair shop were de­stroyed in the blast. “The econ­omy was al­ready a dis­as­ter, and now, I have no way of mak­ing money again,” he said. “It was eas­ier to make money dur­ing the civil war. The politi­cians and the eco­nomic dis­as­ter have ru­ined ev­ery­thing.”</p>
    <p>Said Ms An­toinette Baak­lini, an em­ployee of an elec­tric­ity com­pany that was de­mol­ished in the blast: “It won’t work, it’s just the same peo­ple. It’s a mafia.”</p>
    <p>Work­ers picked up fallen ma­sonry near the build­ing where wall graf­fiti mocked Lebanon’s chronic elec­tric­ity cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Said univer­sity stu­dent Mar­i­lyne Kas­sis: “Ev­ery­one else in the world has elec­tric­ity while we have a don­key... It will al­ways be the same. It is just a po­lit­i­cal game, noth­ing will change.”</p>
    <p>When I first heard the news of the ter­ri­ble ex­plo­sion in Beirut, and then the ram­pant spec­u­la­tion about who might have set it off, my mind drifted back some 40 years to a din­ner party I at­tended at the res­i­dence of Mr Mal­colm Kerr, then pres­i­dent of the Amer­i­can Univer­sity of Beirut.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing din­ner, some­one men­tioned the un­usual hail­storms that had pelted Beirut the pre­vi­ous two nights. Ev­ery­one of­fered their ex­pla­na­tions for this ex­treme weather event, be­fore Mal­colm, tongue in cheek, asked his guests: “Do you think the Syr­i­ans did it?”</p>
    <p>Mal­colm – a charm­ing man and bril­liant scholar, who was trag­i­cally mur­dered a few months later by uniden­ti­fied as­sas­sins – was be­ing both hu­mor­ous and pro­found. He was pok­ing fun at the Le­banese ten­dency to ex­plain ev­ery­thing as a con­spir­acy and, in par­tic­u­lar, a con­spir­acy per­pe­trated by Syria, which is why we all laughed.</p>
    <p>But he was also say­ing some­thing pro­found about Le­banese so­ci­ety that, alas, also ap­plies to the United States to­day: the fact that in Lebanon then, and even more so to­day, ev­ery­thing, even the weather, had be­come po­lit­i­cal.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of the sec­tar­ian na­ture of Le­banese so­ci­ety, where all the pow­ers of gov­ern­ing and the spoils of the state had been di­vided, con­sti­tu­tion­ally or in­for­mally, in a very care­ful bal­ance be­tween dif­fer­ent Chris­tian and Mus­lim sects, ev­ery­thing was in­deed po­lit­i­cal. Ev­ery job ap­point­ment, ev­ery in­ves­ti­ga­tion into malfea­sance, ev­ery gov­ern­ment de­ci­sion to fund this and not that was seen as ad­van­tag­ing one group and dis­ad­van­tag­ing an­other.</p>
    <p>It was a sys­tem that bought sta­bil­ity in a highly di­verse so­ci­ety (be­tween spasms of civil war) – but at the price of a con­stant lack of ac­count­abil­ity, cor­rup­tion, mis­gov­er­nance and mis­trust.</p>
    <p>That is why the first ques­tion so many Le­banese asked af­ter the re­cent ex­plo­sion was not what hap­pened, but who did it and for what ad­van­tage?</p>
    <p>The US is be­com­ing like Lebanon and other Mid­dle East coun­tries in two re­spects. First, our po­lit­i­cal dif­fer­ences are be­com­ing so deep that our two par­ties now re­sem­ble re­li­gious sects in a zero-sum con­test for power. They call theirs “Shi’ites and Sun­nis and Ma­ronites” or “Is­raelis and Pales­tini­ans”. We call ours “Democrats and Repub­li­cans”, but ours now be­have just like ri­val tribes who be­lieve they must rule or die.</p>
    <p>And sec­ond, as in the Mid­dle</p>
    <p>East, so in­creas­ingly in the US: Ev­ery­thing is now pol­i­tics – even the cli­mate, even en­ergy, even face masks in a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In­deed, the US is be­com­ing so much like a Mid­dle Eastern coun­try that, while the Le­banese were con­clud­ing that the blast was truly an ac­ci­dent, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump was talk­ing like a Beirut mili­tia leader, declar­ing that it must have been a con­spir­acy. “It was an at­tack. It was a bomb of some kind,” he said his gen­er­als had told him.</p>
    <p>But a so­ci­ety, and cer­tainly a democ­racy, even­tu­ally dies when ev­ery­thing be­comes pol­i­tics. Gov­er­nance gets stran­gled by it. In­deed, it was re­port­edly the fail­ure of the cor­rupt Le­banese courts to act as guardians of the com­mon good and or­der the re­moval of the ex­plo­sives from the port – as the port au­thor­i­ties had re­quested years ago – that paved the way for the ex­plo­sion.</p>
    <p>“For a healthy pol­i­tics to flour­ish, it needs ref­er­ence points out­side it­self – ref­er­ence points of truth and a con­cep­tion of the com­mon good,” ex­plained He­brew Univer­sity re­li­gious philoso­pher, Pro­fes­sor Moshe Hal­ber­tal. “When ev­ery­thing be­comes po­lit­i­cal, that is the end of pol­i­tics.”</p>
    <p>To put it dif­fer­ently, when ev­ery­thing is pol­i­tics, it means that ev­ery­thing is just about power. There is no cen­tre, there are only sides; there’s no truth, there are only ver­sions; there are no facts, there’s only a con­test of wills.</p>
    <p>If you be­lieve that cli­mate change is real, it must be be­cause some­one paid you off with a re­search grant. If you be­lieve the pres­i­dent com­mit­ted an im­peach­able of­fence try­ing to en­list the pres­i­dent of Ukraine to un­der­mine his ri­val Joe Bi­den, it’s only be­cause you want power for your party.</p>
    <p>Il­lib­eral pop­ulists like Mr Trump – or Bibi Ne­tanyahu in Is­rael, Jair Bol­sonaro in Brazil, Vik­tor Or­ban in Hun­gary, Re­cep Tayyip Er­do­gan in Tur­key and Vladimir Putin in Rus­sia – de­lib­er­ately try to un­der­mine the guardians of facts and the com­mon good. Their message to their peo­ple is: “Don’t be­lieve the courts, the in­de­pen­dent civil ser­vants or the fake news gen­er­a­tors; only trust me, my words and my de­ci­sions. It’s a jun­gle out there. My critics are killers (which is what Mr Trump called his press corps), and only I can pro­tect our tribe from theirs. It’s rule or die.” This trend is not only hurt­ing us, it’s killing us.</p>
    <p>The rea­son Mr Trump has ut­terly failed to man­age the Covid-19 pan­demic is that he fi­nally met a force he could not dis­credit and de­flect by turn­ing it into pol­i­tics: Mother Na­ture. She is im­pen­e­tra­ble to pol­i­tics be­cause all she con­sists of is chem­istry, bi­ol­ogy and physics. And she will do what­ever they dic­tate – in this case, spread a coro­n­avirus – whether or not Mr Trump af­firms it.</p>
    <p>The leaders of Ger­many, Swe­den and South Korea as­serted just the op­po­site, say­ing: “No, there are sci­en­tific facts in­de­pen­dent of pol­i­tics, and there is the com­mon good, and we will bow to those facts, and we will serve the com­mon good with a pub­lic health strat­egy.”</p>
    <p>The other day Mr Trump told a GOP au­di­ence in Cleve­land that, if Mr Bi­den won, he would “hurt the Bi­ble, hurt God. He’s against God. He’s against guns. He’s against en­ergy – our kind of en­ergy”.</p>
    <p>Our kind of en­ergy? Yup, it turns out there is now Repub­li­can en­ergy – oil, gas and coal – and Demo­cratic en­ergy – wind, so­lar and hy­dro.</p>
    <p>And if you be­lieve in oil, gas and coal, you are also sup­posed to op­pose abor­tion and face masks. And if you be­lieve in so­lar, wind and hy­dro, you are pre­sumed to be pro-abor­tion rights and pro-masks.</p>
    <p>This kind of think­ing, in the ex­treme, is what de­stroyed Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Libya and Ye­men and is eat­ing away at Is­rael.</p>
    <p>But if you lis­ten to the street demon­stra­tors in Beirut, you can hear how so many Le­banese are starved for a gov­ern­ment that rep­re­sents the com­mon good. Here in Amer­ica, too. Who are the leaders many of us still re­spect and yearn for – even when we dis­agree with them, Prof Hal­ber­tal asked.</p>
    <p>“They are the leaders,” he an­swered, “who be­lieve that there is a realm of the sa­cred – of the com­mon good – that is out­side of pol­i­tics and who make big de­ci­sions based on their best judg­ment of the com­mon good, not their naked power in­ter­ests.”</p>
    <p>These leaders will do a lot for their par­ties; they are not averse to pol­i­tics. They en­gage in it in­tensely – but they recog­nise where it has to stop and start. They won’t sub­vert the Con­sti­tu­tion or start a war or play down a pub­lic health haz­ard to save their own power.</p>
    <p>In the Mid­dle East, those peo­ple are rare and usu­ally get as­sas­si­nated – but we re­mem­ber their names: Yitzhak Rabin,</p>
    <p>Anwar Sa­dat, Rafik Hariri and coura­geous Le­banese jour­nal­ists like my col­leagues Gi­bran Tueni and Samir Kas­sir.</p>
    <p>It is why many of us ad­mire Jus­tice John Roberts when he oc­ca­sion­ally sides with the lib­er­als on Supreme Court de­ci­sions. It is not be­cause the de­ci­sion is lib­eral but be­cause he seems to be act­ing on be­half of the com­mon good, not his po­lit­i­cal tribe.</p>
    <p>It is also why we still ad­mire our mil­i­tary, the guardians of our com­mon good, and are ap­palled and alarmed when we see Mr Trump drag­ging them into “pol­i­tics”. Think of the dig­nity of Mr Al Gore grace­fully sub­mit­ting to a highly politicise­d Supreme Court de­ci­sion giv­ing the 2000 elec­tion to Mr Ge­orge W. Bush. Mr Gore put the com­mon good first. He took a bul­let for Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump would have torn Amer­ica apart over that, and trust me, if he loses in Novem­ber, there is no way he will put the com­mon good ahead of his own and go qui­etly into this good night.</p>
    <p>“When you lose the realm of the sa­cred, that realm of the com­mon good out­side of pol­i­tics, that is when so­ci­eties col­lapse,” Prof Hal­ber­tal said.</p>
    <p>That is what hap­pened to Lebanon, Syria, Ye­men, Libya and Iraq. And that is what is slowly hap­pen­ing to Is­rael and the US. Re­vers­ing this trend is the most im­por­tant project of our gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>When ev­ery­thing is pol­i­tics, it means that ev­ery­thing is just about power. There is no cen­tre, there are only sides; there’s no truth, there are only ver­sions; there are no facts, there’s only a con­test of wills.</p>
