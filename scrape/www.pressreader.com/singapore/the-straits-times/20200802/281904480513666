    <p>It is far-fetched and self-serv­ing for the ac­cused to claim that he was de­ceived and de­frauded by Jho Low. The ac­cused, de­spite claims of be­ing scammed, did not lose money. In­stead, he ben­e­fited im­mensely by the re­mit­tances of huge amounts of money into his ac­count. ’’</p>
    <p>JUS­TICE MOHD NAZLAN MOHD GHAZ­ALI, re­fer­ring to Na­jib Razak. MALAYSIA TAR­NISHED BY CASE</p>
    <p>This case tar­nished Malaysia as a klep­toc­racy. I don’t think Malaysians de­serve that. If not for... the press,</p>
    <p>’’ this crime may have never been de­tected.</p>
    <p>LEAD PROS­E­CU­TOR V. SITHAMBARA­M NA­JIB TRUSTED WRONG PEO­PLE</p>
    <p>If he was at fault, he was only at fault in trust­ing peo­ple that ought to run the com­pany – 1MDB as well as SRC</p>
    <p>’’ In­ter­na­tional. One can say he over-trusted them.</p>
    <p>LEAD DE­FENCE COUN­SEL SHAFEE AB­DUL­LAH, re­fer­ring to Na­jib. ‘I DIDN’T ASK FOR THE MONEY’</p>
    <p>I did not de­mand for the RM42 mil­lion, I did not plan for it, it was never of­fered to me. No ev­i­dence to say so.</p>
    <p>’’ That’s all I want to say. NA­JIB RAZAK</p>
