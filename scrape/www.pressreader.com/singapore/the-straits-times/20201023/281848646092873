    <p>Euro­pean gov­ern­ments are step­ping up re­stric­tive mea­sures to con­tain the spread of the coro­n­avirus, from reim­pos­ing shut­downs to set­ting cur­fews to clos­ing bars and restau­rants.</p>
    <p>Ire­land has be­come the first Euro­pean coun­try to re­turn to a na­tion­wide shut­down as Covid-19 cases rise, and the Czech Re­pub­lic is fol­low­ing in its foot­steps.</p>
    <p>France has in­tro­duced a gen­eral cur­few. And Bri­tain has tight­ened re­stric­tions by clos­ing pubs and restau­rants, with even more dra­co­nian mea­sures ap­plied in dif­fer­ent parts of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Europe now gen­er­ates al­most half of the newly reg­is­tered Covid-19 in­fec­tions, ac­cord­ing to statis­tics com­piled by the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion. And there is no agree­ment on what should be done; the only con­sen­sus to have emerged in the con­ti­nent is that what­ever tra­jec­tory the pan­demic takes, the eco­nomic costs of reim­pos­ing to­tal shut­downs are in­creas­ingly be­com­ing un­af­ford­able.</p>
    <p>Ire­land, which has ex­pe­ri­enced a 75 per cent rise in in­fec­tions over the past month and has al­ready recorded al­most 2,000 deaths in a pop­u­la­tion of around five mil­lion, has, from yes­ter­day, en­forced its high­est level of re­stric­tions. For the next six weeks, its peo­ple have been told to stay at home and can go out only briefly, within a 5km ra­dius.</p>
    <p>“We’re mak­ing a pre-emp­tive strike against the virus, act­ing be</p>
    <p>fore it’s too late,” Ire­land’s Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Leo Varad­kar said.</p>
    <p>But he also ad­mit­ted that the coun­try ex­pects 150,000 peo­ple to lose their jobs over the next “cou­ple of days”. He es­ti­mated that the shut­down would in­flict a loss of around €1.5 bil­lion (S$2.4 bil­lion) on Ire­land in ex­tra spend­ing on un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits and grants, and this is be­fore one takes into ac­count the po­ten­tial drop in tax rev­enue.</p>
    <p>Mr Varad­kar said: “Lock­downs save lives, but they also come with huge costs.”</p>
    <p>It is no­tice­able that although the Czech Re­pub­lic – which now suf­fers Europe’s high­est in­fec­tion rate at al</p>
    <p>most 900 per 100,000 res­i­dents – fol­lowed Ire­land into a to­tal lock­down, its mea­sure is in­tended to last only un­til Nov 3, largely in or­der to con­tain the fi­nan­cial im­pact.</p>
    <p>Else­where in Europe, the pub­lic au­thor­i­ties in­sist that they do not en­vis­age com­plete shut­downs like the ones in Fe­bru­ary and March when the pan­demic first struck the con­ti­nent. In­stead, they are fo­cus­ing on ban­ning so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>In Bel­gium, which at over 800 cases per 100,000 in­hab­i­tants is only sec­ond to the Czech Re­pub­lic in the in­fec­tion stakes, cafes and restau­rants are closed for four weeks and a cur­few from mid­night</p>
    <p>to 5am came into force on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Bel­gium, which in­vented the con­cept of a “so­cial bub­ble” this sum­mer by lim­it­ing the num­ber of peo­ple with whom one can have con­tact to a to­tal of six per month, has now re­duced this num­ber to four.</p>
    <p>And in the Nether­lands, which is third in Europe’s rank­ings for virus in­fec­tions, bars and restau­rants have been or­dered shut since Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Cur­fews are in force else­where in Europe, from France’s big­gest cities on the western part of the con­ti­nent, to Slove­nia on Europe’s eastern edges. And even Switzer­land, which has so far been re­luc­tant to in­tro­duce com­pul­sory mea­sures, has just made it oblig­a­tory to wear masks in pub­lic places.</p>
    <p>In Italy, new re­stric­tions came into ef­fect on Mon­day for bars and restau­rants (which must close by mid­night), along with a ban on par­ties, fairs and am­a­teur team sports.</p>
    <p>Lom­bardy, the wealthy north­ern re­gion which in­cludes the city of Mi­lan and was the most af­fected by the first wave of the pan­demic, yes­ter­day en­forced an overnight cur­few for three weeks.</p>
    <p>Ger­many has yet to re­in­state very strict mea­sures, although Chan­cel­lor Angela Merkel is en­gaged in tough ne­go­ti­a­tions with lead­ers of its fed­eral states on new re­stric­tions, and most cross-border move­ments are sub­ject to quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, in Bri­tain, Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son’s plans to shut down only those re­gions most af­fected in or­der to avoid bring­ing the en­tire coun­try to a stand­still are meet­ing with fierce re­sis­tance from lo­cal au­thor­i­ties and city may­ors, who are de­mand­ing to know how much money they can be ex­pected to get in sub­si­dies.</p>
    <p>The re­sult is a patch­work of con­tra­dic­tory moves, and con­fu­sion about the rel­a­tive in­fec­tion risks in var­i­ous parts of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>For the mo­ment, many of the newly in­fected are still rel­a­tively young and healthy.</p>
    <p>But that could soon change; health au­thor­i­ties through­out the con­ti­nent are con­cerned about a ris­ing in­flux of pa­tients in hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Lothar Wieler, who heads the Robert Koch In­sti­tute, Ger­many’s dis­ease con­trol cen­tre, claims that it is still pos­si­ble to bring the virus un­der con­trol in Europe.</p>
    <p>But “the over­all sit­u­a­tion has be­come very se­ri­ous”, he ad­mit­ted.</p>
