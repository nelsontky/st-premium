    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s na­tional dis­abil­ity in­sur­ance, CareShield Life, will be­gin in Oc­to­ber, the Min­istry of Health an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The in­sur­ance scheme will give a pol­i­cy­holder a monthly pay­out of at least $600 for life if he suf­fers from a se­vere dis­abil­ity that needs longterm care.</p>
    <p>This means the pay­outs will con­tinue even af­ter a per­son has fin­ished pay­ing all the pre­mi­ums for the in­sur­ance scheme.</p>
    <p>The pay­out amount will also rise over the years so that it is enough to meet ris­ing costs.</p>
    <p>CareShield Life is com­pul­sory for res­i­dents born in 1980 or later. Peo­ple aged 30 to 40 will be­gin to pay pre­mi­ums for the scheme from Oct 1.</p>
    <p>The pre­mi­ums will be paid through a per­son’s Medis­ave ac­count from when he turns 30 un­til he reaches the age of 67.</p>
    <p>But once the pol­i­cy­holder has a se­vere dis­abil­ity that re­sults in pay­outs from CareShield Life, the per­son stops pay­ing pre­mi­ums for it.</p>
    <p>Se­vere dis­abil­ity is de­fined as need­ing help in at least three of th­ese ac­tiv­i­ties of daily liv­ing: eat­ing, get­ting dressed, us­ing the toi­let, bathing, mov­ing or walk­ing around, and get­ting from the bed to a chair or vice versa.</p>
    <p>CareShield Life, which pro­vides life­time pay­outs of at least $600 a month in the event of se­vere dis­abil­ity re­quir­ing long-term care, will start on Oct 1 this year.</p>
    <p>It will be com­pul­sory for all res­i­dents born in 1980 or later – in other words, peo­ple who are 40 years old or younger this year.</p>
    <p>Un­der the scheme, they will start pay­ing an­nual pre­mi­ums us­ing their Medis­ave ac­counts on reach­ing their 30th birth­day and stop pay­ing at the age of 67, which means pay­ing pre­mi­ums a to­tal of 38 times.</p>
    <p>They con­tinue to be cov­ered for the rest of their lives even af­ter they stop pay­ing pre­mi­ums.</p>
    <p>On Oct 1, all those aged 30 to 40 will start pay­ing pre­mi­ums and be in­cluded in the na­tional long-term care in­sur­ance scheme.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple who do not have enough money in their Medis­ave ac­count may use money from their spouse’s Medis­ave ac­count, or that of an ap­proved fam­ily mem­ber.</p>
    <p>There are also gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies. Lower- to mid­dle-in­come res­i­dents, who make up two-thirds of house­holds, will get up to 30 per cent sub­sidy for their pre­mi­ums.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans who still can­not af­ford the pre­mi­ums can ap­ply for ad­di­tional sup­port from the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>There is also a tran­si­tional sub­sidy of up to $250 for every­one join­ing the scheme in the first five years.</p>
    <p>Should they de­velop se­vere dis­abil­ity that en­ti­tles them to a pay­out, they stop pay­ing pre­mi­ums</p>
    <p>even if they are younger than the last pre­mium pay­ment age of 67 years.</p>
    <p>As it pro­vides univer­sal cov­er­age, any­one with se­vere dis­abil­ity at the join­ing age of 30 years has to pay only the first pre­mium to qual­ify for life­time pay­outs.</p>
    <p>The amount of pay­out will in­crease over the years, start­ing with $600 a month this year.</p>
    <p>This is to en­sure that the pay­out is enough to meet ris­ing costs.</p>
    <p>For the first five years, both pre­mi­ums and pay­outs will go up by 2 per cent a year.</p>
    <p>In the launch year, pre­mi­ums for 30-year-olds start at $206 a year for men and $253 for women.</p>
    <p>The amount of pre­mi­ums and pay­outs in fu­ture will be de­cided by the CareShield Life Coun­cil, which was set up in April this year.</p>
    <p>How­ever, once a per­son starts col­lect­ing a pay­out, that amount be­comes fixed for the per­son and will not in­crease, even though the scheme’s pay­out amount will go up in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, the pay­out quan­tum will be frozen at the amount in force the year a per­son pays the last pre­mium at the age of 67.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Health Gan Kim Yong said in a state­ment yes­ter­day: “As our pop­u­la­tion ages, we want to en­sure that Sin­ga­pore­ans con­tinue to have ac­ces­si­ble and af­ford­able long-term care.</p>
    <p>“With CareShield Life, se­verely dis­abled Sin­ga­pore­ans can be as­sured that they will re­ceive fi­nan­cial sup­port for life.”</p>
    <p>Se­vere dis­abil­ity is de­fined as need­ing help in at least three of th­ese ac­tiv­i­ties of daily liv­ing: eat­ing, get­ting dressed, us­ing the toi­let, bathing, mov­ing or walk­ing around, and get­ting from the bed to a chair or vice versa.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan said that to­gether with ElderFund, which helps lower-in­come and se­verely dis­abled Sin­ga­pore­ans, “th­ese schemes will col­lec­tively en­hance sup­port for longterm care costs”.</p>
    <p>Those who are on an ElderShiel­d scheme may want to up­grade as their cur­rent in­sur­ance pays a fixed sum for a fixed num­ber of years.</p>
    <p>De­tails of how older res­i­dents may join CareShield Life will be re­leased next year. It will not be com­pul­sory for them.</p>
    <p>Those who opt to join will have to pay top-up pre­mi­ums, but the Gov­ern­ment has al­ready an­nounced that it will pro­vide sub­si­dies to help them.</p>
    <p>As our pop­u­la­tion ages, we want to en­sure that Sin­ga­pore­ans con­tinue to have ac­ces­si­ble and af­ford­able long-term care. With CareShield Life, se­verely dis­abled Sin­ga­pore­ans can be as­sured that they will re­ceive fi­nan­cial sup­port for life.</p>
