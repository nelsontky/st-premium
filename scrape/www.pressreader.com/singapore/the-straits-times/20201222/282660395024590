    <p>Bangkok­born Jongkol­nee Tho­boonme (right), in her 60s, is a Thai na­tional who moved to Sin­ga­pore in 1988.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent, af­fec­tion­ately known as Ms Noo, is the founder and owner of the restau­rant Sabai Fine Thai on the Bay.</p>
    <p>A Bud­dhist, she is mar­ried with two grown-up chil­dren.</p>
    <p>She says: “I miss Thai­land very much dur­ing this pe­riod – its moun­tains, beaches and oh-so-de­li­cious food.</p>
    <p>“When I think of home, I will go to Tan­jong Beach in Sen­tosa, which re­minds me of the beaches in Thai­land’s Hua Hin dis­trict. I sit on the beach with a pic­nic mat and some food, and re­lax by look­ing at the calm­ing wa­ter and the lovely blue sky. I also like to go to Tan­jong Beach Club, a beach bar, for a glass of wine and snacks.</p>
    <p>“Apart from the food at my restau­rant, I have also been go­ing to the Red House Seafood restau­rant in River Val­ley Road for more than 20 years.</p>
    <p>“I love its steamed crab with shred­ded ginger and Chi­nese wine, and its herbal drunken prawn soup, which re­mind me of some seafood dishes back in Thai­land.</p>
    <p>“I also visit the Wat Ananda Met­yarama, a Thai Bud­dhist tem­ple in Jalan Bukit Merah. I make do­na­tions and of­fer food to the monks, es­pe­cially on spe­cial oc­ca­sions such as Ve­sak Day. I also go to med­i­tate and find a sense of peace and calm.”</p>
