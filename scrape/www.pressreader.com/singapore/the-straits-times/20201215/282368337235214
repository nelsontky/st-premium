    <p>Ev­ery­thing might come to those who wait but it seemed a very long one for Max Verstappen, from Sil­ver­stone’s An­niver­sary GP on Aug 9 un­til the sea­son fi­nale in Abu Dhabi on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Mercedes, who be­gan the year with an en­gine prob­lem and dodged a bul­let when the</p>
    <p>Covid-19 pan­demic de­layed the start of the sea­son and en­abled them to fix it, ended it with an­other. Their W11 was un­set­tled on the softest Pirelli tyre, but Toto Wolff also ad­mit­ted that an MGU-K prob­lem – which had seen Ser­gio Perez’s Rac­ing Point ex­pire at the Bahrain GP and Ge­orge Rus­sell’s Wil­liams struck down in FP 1 in Abu Dhabi – had obliged them to turn down the wick on all their en­gines. That ex­plained why Red Bull’s Hon­das had su­pe­rior max­i­mum speed down the long straight.</p>
    <p>Max didn’t care why ei­ther way. It was fun to wear the boot on the other foot.</p>
    <p>Red Bull had be­gun the sea­son full of hope, with their star driver and the promis­ing Alex Al­bon. Much was ex­pected of them.</p>
    <p>But where Lewis Hamil­ton would win 11 of 16 races up to Abu Dhabi on his way to a sev­enth ti­tle and a record of 95 tri­umphs while fin­ish­ing ev­ery race he was in, Valt­teri Bot­tas would win two and fin­ish 15, and Mercedes would end the sea­son cham­pi­ons yet again with 540 points at that stage, Red Bull had fallen flat again.</p>
    <p>Max had won once, and failed to fin­ish five times, and with Al­bon fin­ish­ing 14 but never higher than third, Red Bull had only 282.</p>
    <p>Max re­tired in the open­ing race in Aus­tria and at Monza with en­gine prob­lems; at Mugello and Bahrain when he was caught up in other driv­ers’ shunts, and at Imola when a tyre failed. Oth­er­wise it was all too of­ten the same story: qual­ify third, fol­low the Mercs home. Of­ten the frus­tra­tion was all too ev­i­dent. He was driv­ing his heart out, for the fi­nal podium place. Like Hamil­ton, he is a warrior. And war­riors love the chance to fight.</p>
    <p>In Abu Dhabi things fi­nally played out in his favour. He was fastest in FP1, close in FP2, fastest in FP3, then fastest in Q3 af­ter Hamil­ton had set the pace in Q1 and Q2. It was his first pole of the sea­son, the only one achieved with­out a Mercedes en­gine. And, he dom­i­nated the race, beat­ing Bot­tas by 15.9sec with Hamil­ton a fur­ther 2.4sec down. Small won­der he de­scribed it as “a sim­ply lovely race”.</p>
    <p>It wasn’t enough to un­seat Bot­tas from sec­ond over­all, but it sends Red Bull into the win­ter in a su­per-buoy­ant mood, Mercedes’ en­gine grem­lin not­with­stand­ing. Now the trick they must per­form is to come out fight­ing straight away next sea­son, rather than start­ing be­hind Mercedes and play­ing catch-up.</p>
    <p>It was ironic that a bumper year end ed with such a dull race at Yas Ma­rina, but given the tu­mul­tuous events of the past two grands prix, that was per­haps a bless­ing for the weary F1 cir­cus, which had packed no fewer than three triple-head­ers into the cal­en­dar. It was the short­est F1 sea­son since 1966, yet one of the best.</p>
    <p>It saw, per­force, the re­turn to favourite old school tracks such as Nur­bur­gring, Imola and Turkey, and F1 ven­tured to new venues such as Mugello and Por­ti­mao, all throw­ing curve balls as they de­prived en­gi­neers of rel­e­vant ac­cu­mu­lated track knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>Fer­rari was hum­bled as a grip­ping fight for third over­all was waged be­tween vet­er­ans McLaren, ram­bunc­tious Rac­ing Point with their “pink Mercedes”, and resur­gent Renault, which was set­tled in McLaren’s favour right at the end.</p>
    <p>Pierre Gasly and Perez scored emo­tional first vic­to­ries, and Car­los Sainz, Lando Nor­ris and Rus­sell em­bel­lished their cre­den­tials as Se­bas­tian Vet­tel’s were tar­nished.</p>
    <p>Now, as ev­ery­one pauses for breath and the much-needed Christ­mas break, the prospect of Verstappen fi­nally be­ing able to take the fight to Hamil­ton in 2021 seems ir­re­sistible – and tan­ta­lis­ingly pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Now the trick Red Bull must per­form is to come out fight­ing straight away next sea­son, rather than start­ing be­hind Mercedes and play­ing catch-up.</p>
