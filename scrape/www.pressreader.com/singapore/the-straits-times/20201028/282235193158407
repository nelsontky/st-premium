    <p>Sin­ga­pore shares yes­ter­day posted losses on a com­bi­na­tion of fac­tors – from jit­ters ahead of the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion and ris­ing Covid-19 cases around the world to overnight falls on Wall Street.</p>
    <p>The key Straits Times In­dex (STI) traded un­der wa­ter all day, al­though it pared some of its losses in mid-day trad­ing and wrapped up the day at 2,512.87 – down 10.44 points or 0.4 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ex­cept for China and Malaysia, key gauges else­where in the re­gion – in­clud­ing Ja­pan, Hong Kong, Tai­wan and South Korea – closed in the red too. Aus­tralia lost the most, down 1.7 per cent, de­spite the state of Vic­to­ria re­port­ing its sec­ond day of no new Covid cases or deaths.</p>
    <p>Malaysia share prices rose, with the FTSE Bursa Malaysia Kuala Lumpur Com­pos­ite In­dex up 5.74 points to 1,500.35.</p>
    <p>US stock in­dices had posted their sharpest loss in a month on Mon­day, led by Covid-19 fears and the ab­sence of a much-awaited ac­tion­able stim­u­lus Bill. Prospects of re­cov­ery have dimmed for the world’s largest econ­omy.</p>
    <p>With the United States’ hotly-con­tested pres­i­den­tial elec­tion merely days away – on Nov 3 – OCBC In­vest­ment Re­search said in­vestors may be in­clined to just hold tight.</p>
    <p>This week also marks the end of the month and brings re­bal­anc­ing flows from in­sti­tu­tional in­vestors. This has weighed on stocks, OCBC added, as in­sti­tu­tional in­vestors have lately favoured bonds.</p>
    <p>Over­all trad­ing vol­ume in the Sin­ga­pore mar­ket stood at 1.17 bil­lion shares worth $937 mil­lion. Among the STI con­stituents, six coun­ters were up and 21 down.</p>
    <p>The losses were led by UOB, OCBC and Sing­tel, which col­lec­tively shaved nearly 7 points off the</p>
    <p>STI. Sing­tel dipped 2 cents or 0.9 per cent to $2.10. The counter was rated a “buy” by DBS Group Re­search, given its un­der­val­ued core busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The re­search house said other cat­a­lysts in­clude po­ten­tial di­vest­ments and a strong chance of the Grab-Sing­tel joint ven­ture snag­ging a full dig­i­tal bank­ing li­cence by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>As­cen­das Real Es­tate In­vest­ment Trust out­per­formed the mar­ket’s key barom­e­ter, adding 5 cents or 1.7 per cent to $3.08. The Reit drew a string of favourable rat­ings from bro­kers yes­ter­day, fol­low­ing its third-quar­ter busi­ness up­date which showed bet­ter oc­cu­pancy rates and strong fun­da­men­tals, in­clud­ing a ro­bust bal­ance sheet.</p>
    <p>Catal­ist-listed Aspen (Group) Hold­ings surged 5.5 cents or 25 per cent to 27.5 cents on news that it plans to trans­fer to the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change’s main­board.</p>
