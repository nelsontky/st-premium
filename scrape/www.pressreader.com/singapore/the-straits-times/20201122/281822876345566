    <p>• Tun Dr Ma­hathir Mo­hamad said yes­ter­day that his res­ig­na­tion as Malaysian prime min­is­ter in Fe­bru­ary had noth­ing to do with the Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) coali­tion want­ing Datuk Seri An­war Ibrahim to take over the post, and it was be­cause he had lost the trust of his own party.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir said that af­ter his res­ig­na­tion on Feb 24, he and Mr An­war both failed to garner enough sup­port from MPs to be­come the prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir, 95, was ex­plain­ing why he sud­denly quit as prime min­is­ter this year, a move that threw Malaysia into po­lit­i­cal tur­moil for a week in Fe­bru­ary. He has faced reg­u­lar ac­cu­sa­tions since then that he abruptly re­signed in or­der to pre­vent Mr An­war, 73, from re­plac­ing him as prime min­is­ter as had been agreed by the then rul­ing PH coali­tion.</p>
    <p>The col­lapse of PH led to the emer­gence of Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia pres­i­dent Muhyid­din Yassin as a vi­able can­di­date to be­come Malaysia’s eighth prime min­is­ter. Tan Sri Muhyid­din was ap­pointed premier on March 1 by the Malaysian King, af­ter get­ting a suf­fi­cient num­ber of MPs to sup­port him.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir, who was then chair­man of Ber­satu, said in a blog post that his party went against him on Feb 23 and left the PH coali­tion, thus caus­ing au­to­matic col­lapse of the govern­ment.</p>
    <p>“On Feb 23, I told Ber­satu pres­i­dent Tan Sri Muhyid­din Yassin that his idea of Ber­satu leav­ing Pakatan must be post­poned as Pakatan was still sup­port­ing me. When the Ber­satu supreme coun­cil met af­ter my meet­ing with Muhyid­din and his friends, I begged that they post­pone l eav­ing Pakatan. I sug­gested that we wait and see Pakatan’s re­ac­tion,” Dr Ma­hathir wrote.</p>
    <p>“The supreme coun­cil re­jected my sug­ges­tion and agreed that Ber­satu would leave Pakatan im­me­di­ately. To me, this was the fi­nal de­ci­sion. This meant the trust in me as the chair­man was no more.</p>
    <p>“This also meant that Ber­satu had left Pakatan and the govern­ment had fallen.”</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing PH’s col­lapse, both Dr Ma­hathir and Mr An­war failed to get the min­i­mum 112 MPs from the 222-strong Par­lia­ment, to sup­port their can­di­dacy as the new prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir said that af­ter PH’s col­lapse, he had sup­port from just 66 MPs, while Mr An­war could get only 92 MPs to back him.</p>
