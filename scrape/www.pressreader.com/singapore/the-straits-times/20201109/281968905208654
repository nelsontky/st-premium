    </section>

    <p>A for­mer mas­sage ther­a­pist i n Sin­ga­pore who claims God speaks to him di­rectly and preaches that gam­bling is per­mit­ted in or­der to help needy Mus­lims has sev­eral men blam­ing him for the end of their mar­riages.</p>
    <p>They claim he has taken the women as his spir­i­tual wives.</p>
    <p>Even though the men ad­mit­ted to ini­tially be­ing fol­low­ers of the man’s al­leged de­viant teach­ings, con­ducted in ses­sions that of­ten had him go­ing into a trance, they</p>
    <p>said they quit when he made claims that they dis­agreed with.</p>
    <p>Among other things, he had de­scribed him­self as a prophet.</p>
    <p>The women in­clude lo­cal university grad­u­ates, one of whom was a se­nior ex­ec­u­tive at a Malay-Mus­lim or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times was alerted to the man’s ac­tiv­i­ties by the for­mer hus­bands of three of the women, as well as four for­mer fol­low­ers of the group. They say they want to warn the Mus­lim com­mu­nity about the group, which at its largest had more than a dozen mem­bers.</p>
    <p>The man, who is in his 50s and now a small busi­ness op­er­a­tor, is legally mar­ried un­der the Registry</p>
    <p>of Mus­lim Mar­riages and has three adult chil­dren. He al­legedly also has five “spir­i­tual wives”.</p>
    <p>Checks with the Sin­ga­pore Is­lamic Schol­ars and Reli­gious Teach­ers As­so­ci­a­tion show that his name is not listed on the Asati­zah Recog­ni­tion Scheme, a data­base of cer­ti­fied reli­gious teach­ers here.</p>
    <p>When ap­proached at his home in the west­ern part of Sin­ga­pore, he de­nied any knowl­edge of the group and said he has no “spir­i­tual wives”. ST also con­tacted four of the women, who re­fer to one an­other as “sis­ter”.</p>
    <p>One of them said peo­ple with an</p>
    <p>Such claims are non­sense and they give the women false hope. Be­cause the leader touts him­self as a prophet, the women put him on a pedestal at the ex­pense of their fam­i­lies.’’</p>
    <p>MR MO­HAMED, who said his for­mer wife at­tended the man’s classes and kept notes that showed that the man claimed to be a prophet.</p>
    <p>agenda have been spread­ing “un­truths” about the group.</p>
    <p>The man is known to the au­thor­i­ties here. He was the sub­ject of a po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tion in 2015 after al­le­ga­tions emerged that he had be­haved in­ap­pro­pri­ately to­wards the daugh­ter of one of the “spir­i­tual wives”.</p>
    <p>The po­lice had replied in 2016 that after care­ful con­sid­er­a­tion of the facts and cir­cum­stances, it was not tak­ing ac­tion against him.</p>
    <p>ST also un­der­stands that fol­low­ing com­plaints by mem­bers of the pub­lic, the man was coun­selled by the Fatwa Com­mit­tee of the Is­lamic Reli­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore (Muis), the high­est Is­lamic reli­gious author­ity here.</p>
    <p>ST looked at the claims over a three-month pe­riod – more than 300 pages of hand­writ­ten notes, in­clud­ing a 90-page doc­u­ment which one of the for­mer hus­bands said was the group’s reli­gious man­ual.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing on con­di­tion of anonymity, one for­mer fol­lower said he used to at­tend prayer classes con­ducted by the man. The classes were held in homes and an of­fice in Jalan Sul­tan. They are now con­ducted in a restau­rant near town that the man op­er­ates.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing one of the ses­sions he at­tended with his wife, the for­mer fol­lower said the man told him to buy 4D and Toto so that the win­nings could be used to help other Mus­lims and grow the event man­age­ment busi­ness the group ran.</p>
    <p>“We tracked 4D numbers and were told to re­cite a spe­cial prayer be­fore buy­ing the numbers,” said the for­mer fol­lower.</p>
    <p>Gam­bling is pro­hib­ited in Is­lam. ST also man­aged to un­cover min­utes of meet­ings from 2003 to 2015, as well as What­sApp chat mes­sages among the group’s mem­bers.</p>
    <p>They paint a pic­ture of a man who used his charisma and knowl­edge of reli­gion to con­vince oth­ers that his bless­ings were needed for them to suc­ceed in busi­ness and life.</p>
    <p>WIFE LIED</p>
    <p>Mr Mo­hamed (not his real name) said his for­mer wife started at­tend­ing the man’s classes in 2003.</p>
    <p>The 49-year-old se­nior tech­ni­cian and fa­ther of two adult daugh­ters told ST: “I trusted my wife when she said she needed to at­tend late-night meet­ings be­fore events. I did not know it was all a cover and that she had been at­tend­ing his ‘reli­gious’ classes.”</p>
    <p>He be­came sus­pi­cious in 2006 when he re­turned to Sin­ga­pore after an over­seas post­ing and no­ticed his wife be­hav­ing coldly to­wards him. He said she ap­peared closer to the man in­stead and would of­ten kiss his hand when­ever she met him.</p>
    <p>Her dis­tant be­hav­iour con­tin­ued un­til 2015 when Mr Mo­hamed learnt from notes she kept that she had been se­cretly at­tend­ing the man’s classes for years. The cou­ple di­vorced in 2017. The notes showed the man claimed to be a prophet.</p>
    <p>Mr Mo­hamed said: “Such claims are non­sense and they give the women false hope. Be­cause the leader touts him­self as a prophet, the women put him on a pedestal at the ex­pense of their fam­i­lies.”</p>
    <p>DECEIVED</p>
    <p>I trusted my wife when she said she needed to at­tend late-night meet­ings be­fore events. I did not know it was all a cover and that she had been at­tend­ing his ‘reli­gious’ classes.’’</p>
