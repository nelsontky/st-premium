    <p>Nearly six in 10 Sin­ga­pore­ans or per­ma­nent res­i­dents have en­coun­tered and be­lieved false in­for­ma­tion in the form of text or images, a study has shown.</p>
    <p>The In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies (IPS) sur­vey also found that no one is im­mune to false in­for­ma­tion across all ages, so­cio-eco­nomic sta­tus and ed­u­ca­tional back­grounds, with more than two-thirds of over 2,000 re­spon­dents trust­ing a ma­nip­u­lated “news ar­ti­cle” pre­sented to them as part of the study.</p>
    <p>Se­niors and those liv­ing in oneto three-room Hous­ing Board flats were the most sus­cep­ti­ble to false in­for­ma­tion. Those who had lower lev­els of knowl­edge about the me­dia and i nfor­ma­tion l and­scape were also more sus­cep­ti­ble.</p>
    <p>The study’s find­ings also sug­gest that dig­i­tal and in­for­ma­tion lit­er­acy among Sin­ga­pore­ans is gen­er­ally low, as fewer than a third of re­spon­dents suc­cess­fully recog­nised signs that the “news ar­ti­cle” had been ma­nip­u­lated, among other things.</p>
    <p>Trust in lo­cal main­stream me­dia, such as on­line news web­sites, news­pa­pers and tele­vi­sion, is higher than plat­forms such as so­cial net­work­ing sites (SNS) and in­stant mes­sag­ing (IM).</p>
    <p>IPS yes­ter­day re­leased the find­ings of phase one of its study, which aims to un­der­stand the sus­cep­ti­bil­ity of Sin­ga­pore­ans to­wards false in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The study was con­ducted be­tween Novem­ber and De­cem­ber last year by Dr Carol Soon and re­search as­sis­tant Shawn Goh.</p>
    <p>It found that six in 10 re­spon­dents said they some­times, of­ten, or very of­ten en­coun­tered and be­lieved false in­for­ma­tion in the form of text and images.</p>
    <p>More than two-thirds of them also trusted the ma­nip­u­lated “news ar­ti­cle”, even though its source URL had been changed, it cited false au­thor­i­ties and had mul­ti­ple gram­mat­i­cal er­rors.</p>
    <p>Only 32.5 per cent said the ar­ti­cle was un­trust­wor­thy.</p>
    <p>Even those who are more savvy – such as younger Sin­ga­pore­ans with ter­tiary ed­u­ca­tion – were not im­mune, with 46.9 per cent of them trust­ing the doc­tored ar­ti­cle.</p>
    <p>In terms of spread­ing false in­for­ma­tion, the study found that IM plat­forms and SNS were the main chan­nels for do­ing so.</p>
    <p>Close to three-quar­ters of re­spon­dents said they had shared false in­for­ma­tion on these chan­nels be­cause the in­for­ma­tion came from close fam­ily and friends.</p>
    <p>“In the case of so­cial net­work­ing sites, one ad­di­tional fac­tor may be be­cause peo­ple’s so­cial me­dia feeds ex­ist in in­for­ma­tion bub­bles,” said the study.</p>
    <p>It added that the per­son­alised in­for­ma­tion streams in­crease peo­ple’s chances of be­ing pre­sented with false in­for­ma­tion that re­in­forces their in­di­vid­ual bi­ases.</p>
    <p>The study also looked at re­spon­dents’ trust in me­dia.</p>
    <p>It found that most Sin­ga­pore­ans still rely on what IPS calls le­gacy me­dia – com­monly re­ferred to as main­stream me­dia – for news and cur­rent af­fairs.</p>
    <p>Tele­vi­sion was used most fre­quently by 59.3 per cent of re­spon­dents, fol­lowed by web­sites of lo­cal main­stream me­dia such as The Straits Times and CNA (52.2 per cent), and lo­cal print news­pa­pers (34.8 per cent).</p>
    <p>Trust in these me­dia types was higher than that in SNS such as Face­book, and IM plat­forms such as What­sApp.</p>
    <p>Up to 74 per cent of re­spon­dents said TV news was trust­wor­thy or very trust­wor­thy, fol­lowed by print news­pa­pers (70.1 per cent), ra­dio (67.6 per cent) and on­line web­sites of Sin­ga­pore’s main­stream me­dia (61.6 per cent).</p>
    <p>The study’s au­thors also high­lighted sev­eral im­pli­ca­tions of their find­ings for pub­lic pol­icy.</p>
    <p>First, there is a need to boost dig­i­tal lit­er­acy by equip­ping peo­ple with tools and skills to as­sess dif­fer­ent el­e­ments of in­for­ma­tion, such as sen­sa­tion­alised head­lines, ty­pos, news sources and tone of lan­guage used.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, there should be more tar­geted in­ter­ven­tions for se­niors and those from lower so­cio-eco­nomic back­grounds. Their greater ten­dency to trust the ma­nip­u­lated news ar­ti­cle could sug­gest a class di­vide in in­for­ma­tion lit­er­acy, the study’s au­thors said.</p>
    <p>Third, the qual­ity of jour­nal­ism should be im­proved, par­tic­u­larly for non-main­stream me­dia which may lack the pro­cesses that es­tab­lished news­rooms have in place to en­sure ac­cu­racy.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties can also tap trusted me­dia, as well as tech plat­forms such as search en­gines, to spread cor­rec­tive in­for­ma­tion and de­bunk false­hoods.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, it is use­ful to tap the power of so­cial and com­mu­nity net­works to de­bunk false­hoods.</p>
    <p>The study said: “Dig­i­tal lit­er­acy pro­grammes should also look into im­part­ing soft skills re­lat­ing to in­ter­ven­tion, such as how to re­spond to fam­ily mem­bers and friends who for­ward un­ver­i­fied or false in­for­ma­tion, in a sen­si­tive yet ef­fec­tive man­ner.”</p>
    <p>DON’T NE­GLECT SOFT SKILLS</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal lit­er­acy pro­grammes should also look into im­part­ing soft skills re­lat­ing to in­ter­ven­tion, such as how to re­spond to fam­ily mem­bers and friends who for­ward un­ver­i­fied or false in­for­ma­tion, in a sen­si­tive yet ef­fec­tive man­ner.</p>
