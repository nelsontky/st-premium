    <p>THE­ATRE</p>
    <p>AN AC­TRESS PRE­PARES</p>
    <p>Wild Rice</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, Wild Rice @ Fu­nan</p>
    <p>There are at most 50 peo­ple in the au­di­ence, but ac­tress Siti Khal­i­jah Zainal pulls laugh­ter from them so read­ily, she makes it feel like a full house.</p>
    <p>She bounds onto the stage not as if she is about to put on a pro­duc­tion, but as if she is com­ing home.</p>
    <p>An Ac­tress Pre­pares is, in many ways, the per­fect play for Wild Rice to re­open its the­atre with af­ter months of coro­n­avirus-in­duced clo­sure. It is a mono­logue – no need for so­cial dis­tanc­ing if there is only one per­son on­stage.</p>
    <p>But more than that, it is a love let­ter to live the­atre. It is the story of how act­ing changed one per­son’s life and how this, in turn, has placed her in a po­si­tion to change the lives of oth­ers.</p>
    <p>An Ac­tress Pre­pares, writ­ten by Al­fian Sa’at, riffs on the book An Ac­tor Pre­pares by Rus­sian ac­tor and direc­tor Kon­stantin Stanislavs­ki. It was first devised in 2016, re­worked in 2018 and has now been up­dated for the Covid-19 era.</p>
    <p>Siti, a two-time Life The­atre Award Best Ac­tress win­ner, puts on her make-up while telling her life story. She delves into her child­hood and how she came to be an ac­tress, de­spite the odds.</p>
    <p>She was re­jected for a schol­ar­ship that would have helped her pur­sue act­ing be­cause she was an In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion stu­dent. She man­aged to ap­peal with the help of the­atre com­pany The Nec­es­sary Stage.</p>
    <p>She makes it clear, how­ever, that she is the ex­cep­tion, not the rule.</p>
    <p>She ques­tions if the­atre is at times just mid­dle-class peo­ple telling work­ing-class sto­ries for a mid­dle-class au­di­ence. Many char­ac­ters she has played would not in real life have been able to af­ford a seat in the the­atre, she ob­serves.</p>
    <p>She per­forms ex­tracts from Kuo</p>
    <p>Pao Kun’s banned play The Strug­gle and Wong Souk Yee and Tay Hong Seng’s Esper­anza, a 1986 play about a Filipino helper ac­cused of steal­ing from her em­ployer.</p>
    <p>If Esper­anza feels like an un­can­nily pre­scient choice given the re­cent High Court ac­quit­tal of In­done­sian do­mes­tic worker Parti Liyani of theft, Siti does not com­ment on it. She sim­ply speaks the words, brings the char­ac­ter to life and leaves the au­di­ence to judge.</p>
    <p>Siti pays trib­ute to trail­blaz­ers like Aidli “Alin” Mos­bit – who di­rects her here – and in one of the play’s most mov­ing mo­ments, sings in com­mem­o­ra­tion of Sin­ga­pore the­atre’s late leg­ends – Kr­ishen Jit, Christina Sergeant, Emma Yong and more.</p>
    <p>Af­ter months of Zoom, one is likely to view any sort of live the­atre through a rose-tinted lens. Yet An Ac­tress Pre­pares is finely cal­i­brated for this mo­ment, when the world has come so very close to los­ing the in­dus­try of per­form­ing arts.</p>
    <p>“Noth­ing’s wasted,” says Siti. She is re­fer­ring to method act­ing, but one senses she is also talk­ing of what her in­dus­try has been through in this pan­demic.</p>
    <p>This time has not been wasted, she is say­ing. It is pre­par­ing them for what they will cre­ate next.</p>
