    <p>Chi­nese streaming gi­ant iQiyi’s global arm iQiyi In­ter­na­tional will pro­duce a K-drama for the first time, it an­nounced at the Asia TV Fo­rum and Mar­ket (ATF) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>iQiyi In­ter­na­tional, which is head­quar­tered in Sin­ga­pore, will work with South Korean pro­duc­tion house Stu­dio Dragon and broad­caster JTBC to cre­ate the orig­i­nal Korean-lan­guage series My Room­mate Is A Gu­miho.</p>
    <p>Based on a pop­u­lar South Korean web comic called Liv­ing To­gether, the series will star Jang Ki-yong (Search: WWW, 2019) and Lee Hye-ri (Re­ply 1988, 2015). It is ex­pected to air next year.</p>
    <p>Jang, 28, stars as a myth­i­cal nine-tailed fox spirit, or gu­miho, who has been try­ing to at­tain hu­man form for 999 years.</p>
    <p>But, just as he is on the verge of suc­ceed­ing, a col­lege stu­dent – played by Lee, 26 – ac­ci­den­tally dis­rupts his plans.</p>
    <p>The ro­man­tic com­edy about co­hab­i­ta­tion will be di­rected by Nam Sung-woo (Kkon­dae In­tern, 2020) and writ­ten by Baek Sun­woo and Choi Bo-rim, who adapted the 2018 ro­mance series What’s Wrong With Sec­re­tary Kim to much suc­cess.</p>
    <p>Stu­dio Dragon is be­hind some of the big­gest K-drama hits in re­cent years, in­clud­ing Crash Land­ing On You, which fin­ished its run ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>JTBC has rat­ings jug­ger­nauts in its his­tory as well, such as this year’s crit­i­cally ac­claimed in­fi­delity drama The World Of The Mar­ried and last year’s Sky Cas­tle.</p>
    <p>My Room­mate Is A Gu­miho is the only K-drama pro­duc­tion that has been an­nounced by iQiyi, which held the soft launch of its in­ter­na­tional site www.iq.com last year.</p>
    <p>At ATF, which is held as part of the an­nual Sin­ga­pore Me­dia Fes­ti­val and took place on­line this year, iQiyi also looked back at some of its well-re­ceived pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude mys­tery series The Bad Kids, star­ring Chi­nese ac­tor Qin Hao, which won Best Cre­ative Award at this year’s Bu­san In­ter­na­tional Film Fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>Its com­pe­ti­tion re­al­ity series Youth With You 2 was also a global sen­sa­tion. Of­fi­cial clips of the show, such as per­for­mances of the con­tes­tants, to­talled around 300 mil­lion views.</p>
    <p>iQiyi In­ter­na­tional also signed a three-year mem­o­ran­dum of un­der­stand­ing with the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board to mar­ket Sin­ga­pore as a des­ti­na­tion in China and other key mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, home-grown broad­caster Me­di­a­corp an­nounced on</p>
    <p>Wed­nes­day a dis­tri­bu­tion deal with Hangzhou-based dig­i­tal ser­vice provider Wasu Group.</p>
    <p>More than 1,000 hours of Me­di­a­corp’s Chi­nese-lan­guage</p>
    <p>con­tent will be of­fered to 100 mil­lion sub­scribers across 100 cities in 29 prov­inces in China.</p>
    <p>The three-year col­lab­o­ra­tion is Me­di­a­corp’s largest dis­tri­bu­tion of its cat­a­logue in the Chi­nese mar­ket. Un­der the deal, Wasu au­di­ences in China will get at least 100 hours of fresh Me­di­a­corp ti­tles and con­tent an­nu­ally.</p>
