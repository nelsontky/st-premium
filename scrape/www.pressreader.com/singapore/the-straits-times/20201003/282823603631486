    <p>Aries</p>
    <p>(March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>You need to stand by your plan – oth­er­wise, you may go off the rails en­tirely. It is a good time for you to en­list sup­port.</p>
    <p>Tau­rus</p>
    <p>(April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>In­dulge your­self – even if some­thing feels like it may be too much, keep up the deca­dence. You can al­ways re­cover to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Gem­ini</p>
    <p>(May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>It is a good time to get a grip on debt, if that is an is­sue for you – maybe you can con­sol­i­date mul­ti­ple bills or ne­go­ti­ate lower rates.</p>
    <p>Can­cer</p>
    <p>(June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>You need to deal with crazy ideas – you can pick the best of them and run for­ward far faster than the com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>Leo</p>
    <p>(July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Le­gal is­sues may push you back – but you do not have to let them bring you down. Make sure you have sup­port.</p>
    <p>Virgo</p>
    <p>(Aug 23 - Sept 22) Some­thing small piques your cu­rios­ity and you may de­cide to fol­low up on it. If so, ex­pect a long, in­ter­est­ing jour­ney.</p>
    <p>Li­bra</p>
    <p>(Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Take a sec­ond look – things are not quite what they seem. You may find that peo­ple have been hid­ing some­thing from you.</p>
    <p>Scor­pio</p>
    <p>(Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>You feel you do not have ev­ery­thing you de­serve. It may come across as greedy, but you know what is right.</p>
    <p>Sagit­tar­ius</p>
    <p>(Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>You have to ex­am­ine all the de­tails – things are not what they should be and the sit­u­a­tion can­not im­prove un­til you track down the prob­lems.</p>
    <p>Capri­corn</p>
    <p>(Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>You are filled with ter­rific en­ergy and it helps you to take care of ev­ery­thing im­por­tant. You will feel re­laxed when the day is over.</p>
    <p>Aquar­ius</p>
    <p>(Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Reach out to your fam­ily – es­pe­cially the older folk. You have a chance to score points with and learn some­thing from them.</p>
    <p>Pisces</p>
    <p>(Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>Your en­ergy is per­fect for do­mes­tic pur­suits and maybe for the right kind of ro­mance. Go on a date and things should go well.</p>
