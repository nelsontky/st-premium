    <p>Three sea­soned singers on the home-grown Malay rock scene – Hanafie War­ren, Yazid Love­hunters and Eiss – will hold a joint con­cert, Rock 21, at the Es­planade Con­cert Hall on New Year’s Day.</p>
    <p>It will have a live au­di­ence of up to 250, with no pre-event test­ing re­quired. Al­most all the tick­ets were sold within days of re­lease.</p>
    <p>The show is among a re­cently an­nounced slate of con­certs with live au­di­ences and is part of the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil and Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board’s pi­lot tri­als for live per­for­mances.</p>
    <p>The con­cert will be hosted by vet­eran tele­vi­sion host Na­jip Ali and ac­tress-host Era Farida.</p>
    <p>Hanafie, 66, is look­ing for­ward to singing in front of fans who have been starved of live con­certs. “I am ex­cited to be able to per­form to a live au­di­ence af­ter a long time.”</p>
    <p>The for­mer singer of rock band The Un­wanted started his mu­sic ca­reer in the 1970s and went solo in 1986. He has sold more than 65,000 al­bums through­out his ca­reer and re­leased his ninth al­bum Ri­way­atku (My His­tory) in 2015.</p>
    <p>Yazid, front­man of vet­eran rock trio Love­hunters, has mixed feel­ings about be­ing able to play a live show again. “I am happy and anx­ious and I can­not be­lieve I am able to per­form live again,” says the 58-year-old.</p>
    <p>“The cir­cuit breaker pe­riod made me feel use­less and sad that I was not able to share my pas­sion with oth­ers. Singing and en­ter­tain­ing oth­ers is my rice bowl and it did af­fect me a lot. How­ever, I know how im­por­tant it is for ev­ery­one to stay safe,” he adds.</p>
    <p>Love­hunters, which will not be play­ing with Yazid at this con­cert, re­leased their de­but al­bum, Se­hari Dalam Hidup (A Day In The Life) in 1987. They played a sold-out show at the same venue on New Year’s Day in 2011.</p>
    <p>The band are known for hits on Malay ra­dio, in­clud­ing Ku Ukir Nama Mu (I Carve Your Name) from their first al­bum; Ber­pin­dah Minda (Mov­ing Minds) from the 1991 al­bum Blues Un­tuk Rakyat (Blues For The Peo­ple); and Sam­but­lah Kasihku (Re­ceive My Love) from the 1999 al­bum Kem­bali (Re­turn).</p>
    <p>They also re­leased one English al­bum in 1995 that pro­duced An­gel In The Night, which won the Favourite Lo­cal Song award on Me­di­aCorp ra­dio sta­tion Per­fect 10, now known as 987FM.</p>
    <p>Eiss, 42, win­ner of re­al­ity singing com­pe­ti­tion SG Ma­nia in 2014, wel­comes the re­turn of con­certs with live au­di­ences.</p>
    <p>“This is cer­tainly a step for­ward for our per­for­mance venues and the lo­cal mu­sic in­dus­try,” he says.</p>
