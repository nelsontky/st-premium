    <p>For more than three years, Chi­nese na­tional Chen Bichun paid for forged pass­port stamps in or­der to re­main in Sin­ga­pore il­le­gally to work as a sex worker.</p>
    <p>Her il­licit stay started on March 19, 2016, and came to an end on July 23 last year when she was caught in a Balestier ho­tel room dur­ing a po­lice raid.</p>
    <p>Chen, 38, was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to 14 months’ jail and a $2,000 fine on two charges, one un­der the Im­mi­gra­tion Act and an­other over the forged doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>One other sim­i­lar charge was taken into con­sid­er­a­tion dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>The court heard that her pass­port con­tained 19 en­try stamps and an ap­pli­ca­tion to ex­tend her short-term visit pass, all of which were forged.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions found that Chen came to Sin­ga­pore on March 4, 2016, and was granted 14 days of stay on a so­cial visit pass.</p>
    <p>A friend told Chen that she could help her stay on in Sin­ga­pore and make it ap­pear to the au­thor­i­ties that her stay was le­gal. Each ex­ten­sion would cost $200 and last about two months.</p>
    <p>Chen agreed to the ar­range­ment.</p>
    <p>Af­ter her friend was ar­rested in April 2017 and repa­tri­ated to China, Chen started be­ing con­tacted by an uniden­ti­fied per­son to get the ex­ten­sions.</p>
    <p>She was fi­nally caught on July 23 last year dur­ing a po­lice raid at Balestier Ho­tel.</p>
    <p>The Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Au­thor­ity con­firmed that the 19 en­try stamps and an ap­pli­ca­tion to ex­tend a short-term visit pass were forged, af­ter her Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China pass­port was seized.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther in­ves­ti­ga­tions found that Chen had stayed in Sin­ga­pore il­le­gally for a to­tal of 1,222 days, or about three years and four months.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tor R. Arvin­dren urged the court to sen­tence Chen to at least 15 months’ jail and im­pose a $2,000 fine, not­ing that she “went on a pat­tern of con­duct to get forged stamps”.</p>
    <p>In sen­tenc­ing Chen, District Judge Shaif­fudin Saruwan said the sen­tence was ap­pro­pri­ate to re­flect the se­ri­ous­ness of the crimes and de­ter other like-minded of­fend­ers from fol­low­ing suit.</p>
