    <p>Ship crews check­ing in at Ma­rina South Pier and West Coast Pier to board their ves­sels have been us­ing self-ser­vice kiosks since the start of this month, re­duc­ing queue­ing time and phys­i­cal in­ter­ac­tions dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ship parts such as en­gine com­po­nents and fuel noz­zles are also be­ing 3D-printed lo­cally and tested on Sin­ga­pore-reg­is­tered ves­sels from tug boats to mas­sive con­tainer ships.</p>
    <p>Th­ese are among the 11 joint in­dus­try projects worth $1.625 mil­lion awarded by the Mar­itime and Port Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MPA) un­der the Mar­itime In­no­va­tion and Tech­nol­ogy Fund. They are meant to drive dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and the adop­tion of 3D print­ing in the mar­itime sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the Smart Port Chal­lenge 2020 fi­nals yes­ter­day, Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Trans­port and For­eign Af­fairs Chee Hong Tat said in­no­va­tion is cru­cial in tack­ling dis­rup­tion, dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and de­car­bon­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>He also em­pha­sised the need to re­view poli­cies and rules to sup­port in­no­va­tion. He cited the use of telemedici­ne in ex­am­in­ing and cer­ti­fy­ing fit sea­far­ers on ves­sels, be­fore they dis­em­bark for crew changes. Crew changes have been se­verely af­fected by the pan­demic, with bor­der and travel re­stric­tions leav­ing 400,000 sea­far­ers stranded at sea.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors ini­tially had to take a boat out to the ves­sels at sea to phys­i­cally ex­am­ine the crew. It was costly, time-con­sum­ing and car­ried a high risk of in­fec­tion for the doc­tors.</p>
    <p>“MPA worked with the Min­istry of Health to re­vise our crewchange pro­to­col and port marine cir­cu­lars,” said Mr Chee.</p>
    <p>With the use of telemedici­ne, Sin­ga­pore has fa­cil­i­tated over 54,000 crew changes since March 27, and cre­ated a pro­ce­dure hailed as a global model.</p>
    <p>Mr Chee also said that be­ing in­no­va­tive re­quires ex­per­i­men­ta­tion and risk-tak­ing, and as the world’s largest tran­ship­ment port, Sin­ga­pore is a good lo­ca­tion to test out new ideas. “So­lu­tions that work well in a busy hub port like Sin­ga­pore could be adapted for other ports glob­ally,” he said.</p>
    <p>MPA, with the Sin­ga­pore Ship­ping As­so­ci­a­tion (SSA) and Na­tional Ad­di­tive Man­u­fac­tur­ing In­no­va­tion Clus­ter, had ear­lier this year called for pro­pos­als to drive dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and the adop­tion of 3D print­ing, and had re­ceived 40 sub­mis­sions.</p>
    <p>Of the 11 ap­proved projects, five are fo­cused on im­prov­ing op­er­a­tional re­silience and pro­duc­tiv­ity in the mar­itime sec­tor in a post­pan­demic new nor­mal.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal tech­nol­ogy start-up Ship­sFo­cus is col­lab­o­rat­ing with another mar­itime firm In­novez One to de­velop con­tact­less counter ser­vices at the two piers, said Mr Chee.</p>
    <p>The pro­ject could re­duce queues and save roughly up to $180,000 per year, chang­ing an in­dus­try typ­i­cally used to sched­ul­ing ves­sels and pas­sen­gers us­ing pen and pa­per.</p>
    <p>Ship­sFo­cus founder Chua Chye Poh said that phys­i­cal coun­ters are usu­ally manned 24/7 by around six peo­ple. Costs can be cut as th­ese roles are grad­u­ally au­to­mated with a dig­i­tal book­ing plat­form and self­ser­vice kiosks.</p>
    <p>Another six projects are aimed at de­vel­op­ing 3D-print­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties in the sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Wil­helm­sen Ships Ser­vice and Ger­man man­u­fac­turer Thyssenkru­pp will jointly lead two projects to print and trial the use of 14 ship parts on board Sin­ga­pore-reg­is­tered ves­sels from eight dif­fer­ent ship­ping firms.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish con­struc­tion en­gi­neer­ing firm Lloyd’s Reg­is­ter is also col­lab­o­rat­ing with Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic to pro­duce ship parts that will be fit­ted and tri­alled on ocean-go­ing ves­sels from Nep­tune Pa­cific Line.</p>
