    <p>Gold prices are ex­pected to con­tinue climb­ing next year as in­vestors flock to the safe-haven as­set amid the lin­ger­ing un­cer­tainty of the pan­demic. The yel­low metal has lost some of its shine, but prices are still set to rise as coun­tries grap­ple with vac­cine roll-outs and cur­ren­cies de­pre­ci­ate, say an­a­lysts.</p>
    <p>Gold prices are ex­pected to con­tinue climb­ing next year as in­vestors flock to the safe-haven as­set amid the lin­ger­ing un­cer­tainty of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The yel­low metal has lost some of its shine due to grow­ing vac­cine op­ti­mism and grad­ual eco­nomic re­cov­ery, but prices are still set to rise as coun­tries grap­ple with vac­cine roll-outs and cur­ren­cies de­pre­ci­ate as cen­tral banks ramp up relief mea­sures, say an­a­lysts.</p>
    <p>DBS Pri­vate Bank in­vest­ment strate­gist Joanne Goh said gold is seen as a safe-haven as­set be­cause it is un­cor­re­lated to other risk as­sets such as eq­ui­ties.</p>
    <p>“It is ex­pected to re­tain its value when other as­sets crum­ble.”</p>
    <p>Gold spot prices climbed as much as 36 per cent this year, top­ping US$2,000 an ounce for the first time on Aug 4 be­fore hit­ting a peak of US$2,063.54 two days later.</p>
    <p>UOB Pri­vate Bank in­vest­ment strate­gist Fran­cis Tan said the record prices were due to grow­ing fear and poor in­vestor con­fi­dence in the global econ­omy over sev­eral months.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing that time, vac­cines were still not in sight while in­fec­tions kept climb­ing, so there were ex­pec­ta­tions that the fu­ture would not be so bright,” he added.</p>
    <p>Ms Goh said prices mainly rose due to quan­ti­ta­tive eas­ing by the Fed­eral Re­serve in the United States.</p>
    <p>“Quan­ti­ta­tive eas­ing (QE) has the ef­fect of pro­vid­ing liq­uid­ity into the sys­tem, bring­ing bond yields downs, weak­en­ing the dol­lar and driv­ing higher in­fla­tion. These fac­tors are pos­i­tive for gold prices,” she added.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said prices are un­likely to hit the same peak next year but they are still set to rise.</p>
    <p>He cited UOB’s fore­cast that gold will trend up towards US$2,000 by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>“Although there are vac­cines, there’s still a big ques­tion mark on their ca­pac­ity, pro­duc­tion, dis­tri­bu­tion and im­ple­men­ta­tion,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan noted that cen­tral banks, in­clud­ing the US Fed, have also said they will still sup­port the econ­omy and im­ple­ment QE, which will also en­cour­age in­vestors to turn to gold.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, Ms Goh said: “This time round, we are not only see­ing quan­ti­ta­tive eas­ing in the United States, but also other coun­tries in­clud­ing Ja­pan, Europe, Aus­tralia. This is not only un­prece­dented but the size of QE is also over­whelm­ing and a lot larger than the Fed’s QE in 2008.”</p>
    <p>Gold prices also surged dur­ing the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis and sub­se­quent years. They rose 166.8 per cent from US$712.25 on Nov 12, 2008, to US$1,900 on Sept 5, 2011.</p>
    <p>DBS Pri­vate Bank ex­pects gold to hit a new high of US$2,300 next year due to the un­prece­dented level of QE that is ex­pected to con­tinue un­til the end of 2021, said Ms Goh.</p>
    <p>“In­ter­est rates are ex­pected to stay low for the next two years. We rec­om­mend gold as a risk di­ver­si­fier which pro­tects the port­fo­lio in times of high volatil­ity in the stock mar­ket.”</p>
