    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Five-time Ma­jor win­ner Phil Mick­el­son and re­tired Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) star Charles Barkley de­feated NBA guard Stephen Curry and re­tired NFL quar­ter­back Pey­ton Man­ning 4 and 3 in a char­ity golf match on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The made-for-tele­vi­sion spec­ta­cle, The Match: Cham­pi­ons for Change, was staged be­hind closed doors at Stone Canyon Golf Club in Oro Val­ley, Ari­zona, to ben­e­fit his­tor­i­cally black uni­ver­si­ties as well as feed­ing-the-needy char­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The first edi­tion of The Match was played in 2018 at Shadow Creek in Las Ve­gas, where Mick­el­son beat Tiger Woods in a win­ner-take-all US$9 mil­lion (S$12 mil­lion) show­down.</p>
    <p>A re­match was held in May at Medal­ist Golf Club in Hobe Sound, Florida, where Woods and Man­ning beat Mick­el­son and six-time Su­per Bowl-win­ning quar­ter­back Tom Brady, rais­ing over US$20 mil­lion for Covid-19 re­lief.</p>
    <p>On Fri­day, Mick­el­son sank four birdie putts and Barkley, known for his swing strug­gles, was bet­ter than ex­pected i n dis­patch­ing Golden State War­riors sharp­shooter Curry and two-time Su­per Bowl cham­pion Man­ning.</p>
    <p>“The man is strong and has a deft, soft touch around the green,” Mick­el­son de­clared about Barkley, a 1993 NBA Most Valu­able Player who is now a 57-year-old TV com­men­ta­tor. “He has sim­pli­fied ev­ery­thing and calmed his mind down.”</p>
    <p>Barkley’s er­rant tee shots were played for laughs early on, with pre-match gifts of a safety vest, mace, snakebite kit and snacks in case he got lost seek­ing a woe­fully er­rant drive.</p>
    <p>But he had the last laugh, do­ing a re­spectable job off the tees and with his short game.</p>
    <p>“I’m go­ing to keep get­ting bet­ter,” he said. “I’m get­ting there.”</p>
    <p>The 18-hole mod­i­fied al­ter­nate shot event be­gan with Man­ning par­ring the open­ing hole to put him­self and Curry ahead, but Mick­el­son and Barkley, shak­ing off the taunts, won the next four holes to seize a 3-up ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>A way­ward drive at the sev­enth turned into a win for Mick­el­son and Barkley when Man­ning found a green­side bunker, but the 4-up lead lasted only un­til a missed Barkley putt let Curry, 32, and Man­ning, 44, win the eighth to pull within 3-down.</p>
    <p>Barkley and Mick­el­son, 50, won the 10th to re­gain a 4-up edge but Mick­el­son’s tee shot at No. 11 found desert bushes and they needed five to reach the green as Curry and Man­ning pulled within three with seven holes to play.</p>
    <p>A strong Barkley chip from green­side rough en­abled the Mick­el­son duo to cap­ture the 12th hole with a dou­ble bo­gey, as Man­ning and Curry strug­gled in the desert sand.</p>
    <p>After halv­ing the 13th and 14th holes to go dormy, Mick­el­son and Barkley won at the par-five 15th.</p>
    <p>Man­ning holed an eight-foot birdie putt, but Mick­el­son topped him from six feet to halve the hole and claim the match.</p>
