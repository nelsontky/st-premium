    <p>1 Fire forces evac­u­a­tions A wind-driven wild­fire that erupted in Cal­i­for­nia’s Napa Val­ley on Sun­day has forced the evac­u­a­tion of a hos­pi­tal and hun­dreds of homes.</p>
    <p>It was the hos­pi­tal’s sec­ond wild­fire-re­lated evac­u­a­tion in a month, af­ter a mas­sive clus­ter of light­ning-sparked blazes swept through coun­ties north of the San Fran­cisco Bay re­gion last month.</p>
    <p>(Cal­i­for­nia) • A wind­driven wild­fire that erupted on Sun­day in north­ern Cal­i­for­nia’s Napa Val­ley wine coun­try spread across nearly 809ha and forced the evac­u­a­tion of a hos­pi­tal and hun­dreds of homes, au­thor­i­ties said.</p>
    <p>Fire crews were out in force, scram­bling to fend off flames threat­en­ing neigh­bour­hoods and vine­yards at the north­ern end of the famed wine-grow­ing val­ley and sur­round­ing hill­sides, about 120km north of San Fran­cisco.</p>
    <p>The blaze, dubbed the Glass Fire, broke out be­fore dawn near Cal­is­toga and raced to­wards the ad­ja­cent com­mu­ni­ties of Deer Park and St He­lena, with flames reach­ing near the Ad­ven­tist Health St He­lena hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>All 55 pa­tients there at the time were safely evac­u­ated by am­bu­lance and he­li­copter over the course of five hours, hos­pi­tal spokesman Linda Wil­liams said. “We had am­bu­lances lined up from all over the Bay area,” she told Reuters, adding that al­though smoke shrouded the fa­cil­ity, the skies above were clear enough for the he­li­copters’ air­lift ef­forts.</p>
    <p>It was the sec­ond wild­fire-re­lated evac­u­a­tion of the 151-bed hos­pi­tal in a month, af­ter a mas­sive clus­ter of light­ning-sparked blazes that swept through sev­eral coun­ties north of the San Fran­cisco Bay re­gion last month.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties also or­dered about 600 homes evac­u­ated on Sun­day, with res­i­dents of 1,400 more warned to be ready to flee at a mo­ment’s no­tice, said Mr Tyree Zan­der, a spokesman for the state’s forestry and fire pro­tec­tion depart­ment. The no­tices af­fected at least 5,000 peo­ple, he added.</p>
    <p>By evening, flames stoked by winds gust­ing up to 80kmh had scorched about 728ha of grassy rolling hill­sides and oak wood­lands, with lit­tle or no con­tain­ment, Mr Zan­der said.</p>
    <p>The cause of the fire is be­ing in­ves­ti­gated. There were no im­me­di­ate re­ports of in­juries.</p>
    <p>The blaze erupted mid­way through the tra­di­tional grape-har­vest­ing pe­riod in the Napa Val­ley, world renowned as one of Cal­i­for­nia’s premier wine-pro­duc­ing re­gions. The area’s 475 winer­ies ac­count for just 4 per cent of the state’s to­tal an­nual grape har­vest but half of the re­tail value of all Cal­i­for­nia wines sold, ac­cord­ing to the Napa Val­ley Vint­ners trade group.</p>
    <p>Napa and other wine-grow­ing re­gions have been hit by wild­fires in and around the Bay area for sev­eral years. Ms Su­san Krausz, co-owner of Arken­stone Es­tate Vine­yards in the How­ell Moun­tain com­mu­nity of Ang­win, said it would take days or weeks to as­sess the im­pact of the lat­est blaze on val­ley vint­ners.</p>
    <p>“Most peo­ple have har­vested,” she said, but added: “Any time’s a bad time for a fire.”</p>
    <p>The public safety power shut­offs were ex­pected to af­fect about 65,000 re­gional homes and busi­nesses, said PG&E, the state’s largest elec­tric util­ity.</p>
    <p>A red flag warn­ing for ex­treme wild­fire risks for Napa Val­ley would run through yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia wild­fires have scorched more than 1.5 mil­lion ha in the first nine months of 2020, far ex­ceed­ing any sin­gle year in state his­tory, killing 26 peo­ple and de­stroy­ing more than 7,000 struc­tures.</p>
