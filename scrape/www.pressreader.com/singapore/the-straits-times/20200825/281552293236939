    <p>In­dia’s main op­po­si­tion party Congress was thrown into tur­moil yes­ter­day as a lead­er­ship cri­sis spilled out into the open. The party, which is fight­ing an up­hill bat­tle for po­lit­i­cal sur­vival and rel­e­vance, has seen a lead­er­ship vac­uum since Mr Rahul Gandhi re­signed as party pres­i­dent last year.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s main op­po­si­tion party Congress was thrown into tur­moil yes­ter­day as a lead­er­ship cri­sis spilled out into the open, in the lat­est set­back for the party which is fight­ing an up­hill bat­tle for po­lit­i­cal sur­vival and rel­e­vance.</p>
    <p>A marathon meet­ing of the Congress Work­ing Com­mit­tee (CWC), the party’s top de­ci­sion-making body, was held yes­ter­day af­ter a let­ter from 23 party lead­ers sought in­ter­nal changes in­clud­ing a “full­time and vis­i­ble” lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>Congress has seen a lead­er­ship vac­uum since Mr Rahul Gandhi re­signed as pres­i­dent last year to take moral re­spon­si­bil­ity for the party’s loss in the gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>His mother So­nia Gandhi, who be­came in­terim pres­i­dent, is known to be in poor health and he has re­sisted calls over the past year to re­sume charge.</p>
    <p>The meet­ing ap­peared to have put a lid on the cri­sis of lead­er­ship for now, with most Congress lead­ers ral­ly­ing around the Gandhi fam­ily and ex­press­ing faith in their lead­er­ship. A CWC state­ment said “no one can be per­mit­ted to weaken the party”.</p>
    <p>The let­ter has been in­ter­preted as a crit­i­cism of the Gandhi-Nehru fam­ily that has dom­i­nated Congress since In­dia’s in­de­pen­dence in 1947 and given the coun­try three prime min­is­ters, even as its writ­ers main­tained it was to help re­vive the party.</p>
    <p>Those who penned the let­ter in­cluded heavy­weights such as Mr Ghu­lam Nabi Azad, Mr Shashi Tha­roor and Mr Kapil Sibal, who found them­selves un­der at­tack from col­leagues at the meet­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Gandhi crit­i­cised the tim­ing of the let­ter, even as his mother, who had wanted to quit be­cause of it, was per­suaded dur­ing the meet­ing to con­tinue for now.</p>
    <p>He said it was un­for­tu­nate the let­ter came at a time when his mother was ail­ing and the party had just re­cov­ered from a cri­sis in Ra­jasthan.</p>
    <p>He is un­der­stood to have said that Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would ben­e­fit from the cur­rent cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Mrs Gandhi said in con­clud­ing re­marks at the meet­ing that the party needed to be united and she did not hold any “ill will against any­one”.</p>
    <p>The trou­ble is not new to Congress, which has been strug­gling po­lit­i­cally since 2014 when Prime Min­is­ter Modi swept to power on a land­slide win and then re­turned last year with an even big­ger man­date.</p>
    <p>Congress won just 44 of 542 seats in the Lower House of Par­lia­ment last year, in con­trast to the 303 seats won by the BJP.</p>
    <p>Al­though Mr Gandhi re­signed as Congress pres­i­dent af­ter the loss, he has con­tin­ued to be the face of the party and makes de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>Still, this style of func­tion­ing is seen to have rubbed some se­nior party lead­ers the wrong way amid con­cerns that Mr Gandhi re­sisted tak­ing them into his con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts said the cur­rent cri­sis would only strengthen the per­cep­tion that the 135-year-old party re­mained in­ca­pable of play­ing the cru­cial role of a strong op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor San­jay Ku­mar, di­rec­tor of the Cen­tre for the Study of De­vel­op­ing So­ci­eties, said: “Congress is al­ready a ship which is sink­ing. What­ever is com­ing out from th­ese meet­ings, it gives an in­di­ca­tion to com­mon peo­ple that the party, which should be work­ing to win the con­fi­dence of the peo­ple, is not able to do so. It (the con­tro­versy) is only do­ing harm to the party.”</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal com­men­ta­tor and colum­nist Neerja Chowdhury called it a “missed op­por­tu­nity” for the party.</p>
    <p>“You see from the way the whole thing has been han­dled... every­body has come to the res­cue of the Gand­his and crit­i­cised those who wrote the let­ter. The re­sult is that the Gand­his be­came the fo­cal point of the ex­er­cise and not the is­sues raised by the 23 peo­ple about what needs to change and the need for a full-time pres­i­dent to end the drift. All that has been put on the back-burner.”</p>
    <p>The party has seen a num­ber of crises in the past year.</p>
    <p>In March, it suf­fered a po­lit­i­cal set­back fol­low­ing the res­ig­na­tion of Mr Jy­oti­ra­ditya Scin­dia, who top­pled the Congress govern­ment in Mad­hya Pradesh and helped the BJP to come back to power.</p>
    <p>Last month, Congress staved off a po­lit­i­cal cri­sis in Ra­jasthan af­ter state leader Sachin Pi­lot and a hand­ful of Mem­bers of the Leg­isla­tive As­sem­bly re­volted. But he was per­suaded to re­turn to the party fold.</p>
    <p>Still, the crit­i­cism against those who wrote the let­ter is seen as a sign that a sec­tion of the party is not ready to give up on the dy­nasty.</p>
    <p>Bengaluru-based po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst San­deep Shas­tri said: “I don’t think the non-fam­ily lead­er­ship is ready to bite the bul­let, partly be­cause of the ca­bal around the (Gandhi) lead­er­ship. This ca­bal con­sists of lead­ers who haven’t won di­rect elec­tions for some time. They have no mass base of their own and if the First Fam­ily doesn’t have its place, this ca­bal would lose its im­por­tance.”</p>
    <p>Congress is al­ready a ship which is sink­ing. What­ever is com­ing out from th­ese meet­ings, it gives an in­di­ca­tion to com­mon peo­ple that the party, which should be work­ing to win the con­fi­dence of the peo­ple, is not able to do so. It (the con­tro­versy) is only do­ing harm to the party.’’</p>
