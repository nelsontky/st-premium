    <p>• For­mer Liver­pool man­ager Ger­ard Houl­lier, who re­built the Reds from Premier League un­der­achiev­ers into a Cup tre­blewin­ning side in 2001, yesterday died aged 73.</p>
    <p>French me­dia out­lets RMC sport and L’Equipe said Houl­lier, who also coached the French na­tional team, Paris Saint-Ger­main, Lyon and As­ton Villa, died in Paris af­ter a heart op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“We are mourn­ing the pass­ing of our tre­ble-win­ning man­ager, Ger­ard Houl­lier,” Liver­pool said on Twit­ter. “The thoughts of ev­ery­one at Liver­pool Foot­ball Club are with Ger­ard’s fam­ily and many friends. Rest in peace, Ger­ard Houl­lier 1947-2020.”</p>
    <p>Houl­lier had a his­tory of heart prob­lems, dat­ing back to 2001 when he was rushed to hos­pi­tal at half-time dur­ing a Premier League game be­tween Liver­pool and Leeds. His spell at Villa was also dis­rupted by his health. He did not re­turn to the touch­line af­ter leav­ing by mu­tual con­sent in 2011 be­cause of a heart prob­lem.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to The Daily Mail, Houl­lier re­port­edly sent a text mes­sage to his friends and fam­ily over the week­end, say­ing: “I am strug­gling but I am go­ing to come out of this.”</p>
    <p>For­mer Liver­pool striker Michael Owen, whose two late goals won the 2001 FA Cup fi­nal against Arse­nal with Houl­lier in charge, was among many lead­ing fig­ures in English foot­ball to pay trib­ute to the French­man.</p>
    <p>He tweeted: “Ab­so­lutely heart­bro­ken to hear that my old boss, Ger­ard Houl­lier, has sadly passed away. A great man­ager and a gen­uinely car­ing man. #RIPBoss”</p>
    <p>For­mer Liver­pool de­fender Jamie Car­ragher added: “Ab­so­lutely dev­as­tated by the news about Ger­ard Houl­lier, I was in touch with him only last month to ar­range him com­ing to Liver­pool.</p>
    <p>“Loved that man to bits, he changed me as a per­son and as a player and got Liver­pool back win­ning tro­phies. RIP Boss.”</p>
    <p>Phil Thomp­son, Houl­lier’s as­sis­tant at Liver­pool who was care­taker coach while he was re­cov­er­ing from his or­deals, paid trib­ute to his men­tor.</p>
    <p>“My mate, my col­league, my boss,” he tweeted. “One of the great­est mo­ments of my life was when we came to­gether in 1998. Just to be in his com­pany was an ab­so­lute treat. So loyal, so pas­sion­ate and ex­tremely fierce.”</p>
    <p>Steven Gerrard, who was made Liver­pool cap­tain by Houl­lier, wrote on In­sta­gram: “Dev­as­tated to hear the news my for­mer man­ager Ger­ard Houl­lier has passed away. I will never for­get what this man did for me and my ca­reer. Rest in peace Boss. YNWA x”</p>
    <p>Af­ter an in­signif­i­cant play­ing ca­reer in France’s lower leagues, Houl­lier be­gan coach­ing in 1973, earn­ing his first big job with Lens be­fore tak­ing over at PSG.</p>
    <p>He be­came France’s na­tional team coach in 1992 but that spell was un­suc­cess­ful and no­table for their fail­ure to qual­ify for the 1994 World Cup fol­low­ing shock home de­feats by Is­rael and Bul­garia. He de­scribed the 2-1 loss to Bul­garia as “the most cat­a­strophic sce­nario imag­in­able” when a draw would have been enough to qual­ify, only for a goal in added time to sink their hopes.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the de­ba­cle, Houl­lier took some time away from top-level foot­ball to fo­cus on youth coach­ing but he even­tu­ally re­built his rep­u­ta­tion at An­field.</p>
    <p>He first joined the Reds by shar­ing man­ager du­ties with Roy Evans in 1998. He as­sumed full re­spon­si­bil­ity and led the team to a tre­ble of the FA Cup, League Cup and Uefa Cup in 2001.</p>
    <p>Houl­lier, who left An­field in 2004 af­ter win­ning five ma­jor tro­phies, also had suc­cess in France with Lyon, lead­ing them to backto-back Ligue 1 ti­tles.</p>
