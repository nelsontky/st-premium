    <p>WASH­ING­TON Dr An­thony Fauci, the top United States in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­pert, said that a gath­er­ing in the White House Rose Gar­den last month was a “su­per-spreader event” for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>He also said US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s talk about an ex­per­i­men­tal Covid-19 treat­ment he re­ceived as “a cure” may cause con­fu­sion.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump held a cer­e­mony in the White House Rose Gar­den on Sept 26 to hon­our Supreme Court nom­i­nee Amy Coney Bar­rett.</p>
    <p>While the White House had a test­ing regime in place to screen for virus cases, few guests wore masks and at­ten­dees min­gled and sat in close prox­im­ity to one another, both in­doors and out­doors. Sub­se­quently, the Pres­i­dent and sev­eral top staff, as well as sen­a­tors and mil­i­tary of­fi­cials, tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Dr Fauci said in an in­ter­view on Fri­day with CBS News Ra­dio: “We had a su­per-spreader event in the</p>
    <p>White House. And it was in a sit­u­a­tion where peo­ple were crowded to­gether, were not wear­ing masks. So the data speak for them­selves.”</p>
    <p>He said that peo­ple who are in­fected with the coro­n­avirus but are not yet show­ing symp­toms can trans­mit the pathogen to oth­ers, which makes the case for wear­ing face cov­er­ings.</p>
    <p>Asymp­to­matic in­di­vid­u­als “are a sub­stan­tial part of the peo­ple that ac­tu­ally trans­mit in­fec­tions to other peo­ple”, he said. “So the bet­ter part of the rec­om­men­da­tion would be every­body wear a mask, lit­er­ally uni­ver­sally.”</p>
    <p>Asked about Mr Trump’s ef­fu­sive praise for Re­gen­eron’s an­ti­body treat­ment, Dr Fauci said talk­ing about a “cure” could be mis­lead­ing be­cause it has not yet been proven, and the drugs that are cur­rently avail­able have been shown to have only mod­est to mod­er­ate re­sults.</p>
    <p>“We don’t have any in­di­ca­tion – I think you re­ally have to de­pend on what you mean by a cure, be­cause that’s the word that leads to a lot of con­fu­sion,” he said.</p>
