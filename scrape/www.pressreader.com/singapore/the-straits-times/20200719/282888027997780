    <p>Will China’s in­flu­ence in WHO grow? Editorial</p>
    <p>The Yomi­uri Shim­bun, Ja­pan</p>
    <p>The United States has of­fi­cially no­ti­fied the United Na­tions that it will with­draw from the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO).</p>
    <p>If the United States ful­fils the pre­req­ui­site con­di­tions, the with­drawal will take ef­fect one year af­ter the no­ti­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The root of this ac­tion is ap­par­ently US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s strong dis­sat­is­fac­tion with the UN agency, say­ing: “China has to­tal con­trol over the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion.”</p>
    <p>When coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions first spread in China, the re­al­ity is that WHO failed to deal ap­pro­pri­ately with the is­sue, ex­pos­ing prob­lems in the way in­for­ma­tion is trans­mit­ted and main­tain­ing neu­tral­ity.</p>
    <p>WHO is re­quested to carry out im­par­tial re­views and or­gan­i­sa­tional re­form.</p>
    <p>The with­drawal of the US from WHO, how­ever, will not nec­es­sar­ily im­prove the sit­u­a­tion. Is it re­ally pos­si­ble to say it is bet­ter for the or­gan­i­sa­tion serv­ing as the head­quar­ters for coro­n­avirus mea­sures to be shaken and</p>
    <p>China’s in­flu­ence in it to be ex­panded?</p>
    <p>The US con­trib­utes to about 16 per cent of the WHO bud­get. WHO ac­tiv­i­ties will in­evitably be dealt a blow if WHO can­not ob­tain such funds from the US gov­ern­ment. There is a fear that the co­op­er­a­tive sys­tem be­tween the US and other coun­tries to de­velop coro­n­avirus vac­cines and ther­a­peu­tic drugs could also be ad­versely af­fected.</p>
    <p>For­mer US vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den, the pre­sump­tive chal­lenger to Mr Trump in the pres­i­den­tial race, ex­pressed his view that the US will re­main in WHO if he is elected. The fi­nal de­ci­sion on whether the US will with­draw will de­pend on the out­come of the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Cal­lous po­lit­i­cal gam­ble Editorial</p>
    <p>China Daily, China</p>
    <p>Hav­ing thrown a to-do list at WHO to com­mit to “sub­stan­tive im­prove­ments” and giv­ing it a 30-day ul­ti­ma­tum to carry it out, the US has used the or­gan­i­sa­tion’s re­jec­tion of the un­jus­ti­fied de­mands as the ex­cuse to make good on the US pres­i­dent’s prom­ise to with­draw the coun­try from the global health body.</p>
    <p>In of­fi­cially no­ti­fy­ing the United Na­tions that it is with­draw­ing from WHO, the ad­min­is­tra­tion is de­liv­er­ing on the vow the US pres­i­dent made in May, when he was scrab­bling around look­ing for scape­goats for his ad­min­is­tra­tion’s woe­ful re­sponse to the pan­demic, and WHO and China were cho­sen to be the main de­flec­tors of pub­lic anger.</p>
    <p>Com­ing af­ter the US ad­min­is­tra­tion had bought up vir­tu­ally all stocks for the next three months of the anti-vi­ral drug Remde­sivir, which has been shown to have some ef­fi­cacy in the treat­ment of Covid-19, the move re­in­forces the fact that the White House is will­ing to cal­lously gam­ble with peo­ple’s lives to se­cure votes.</p>
    <p>With the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion loom­ing ever closer, the White House is des­per­ate to pin the blame on oth­ers for the mess in the US, and it knows China is a sure­fire vote-win­ning bete noire of some.</p>
    <p>The US’ fund­ing to WHO is roughly US$400 mil­lion ($556 mil­lion) a year and that ac­counts for nearly 17 per cent of the or­gan­i­sa­tion’s ex­pen­di­ture, which has helped WHO in its ef­forts to com­bat small­pox, po­lio, Ebola, Zika and measles.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic health ex­perts and politi­cians around the world have been unan­i­mous in lam­bast­ing the</p>
    <p>US’ de­ci­sion, call­ing it “sense­less”, “as­tound­ing”, “aw­ful”, “rogue” and short­sighted”, among other things.</p>
    <p>When even WHO can be­come a card in the US ad­min­is­tra­tion’s hand, some of the lives claimed by the virus would be lost as stakes in the ad­min­is­tra­tion’s in­iq­ui­tous po­lit­i­cal gam­ble.</p>
    <p>Exit from WHO</p>
    <p>Editorial</p>
    <p>The States­man, In­dia</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s hith­erto carp­ing crit­i­cism of and re­duc­tion of fund­ing to WHO has fruc­ti­fied with his de­ci­sion to pull out.</p>
    <p>The ac­tion is as much against the in­ter­na­tional en­tity as it is against China. As was only to be ex­pected, China has promptly ad­vanced a spir­ited de­fence of WHO.</p>
    <p>The move is an­other demon­stra­tion of the US pur­su­ing uni­lat­er­al­ism in diplo­macy, with­draw­ing from groups and break­ing con­tracts.</p>
    <p>WHO has been de­scribed as “the most au­thor­i­ta­tive and pro­fes­sional in­ter­na­tional in­sti­tu­tion in the field of global pub­lic health security” by China’s for­eign min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian.</p>
    <p>But this ring­ing en­dorse­ment may well be a con­se­quence of WHO’s de­ci­sion to send a team to China to in­ves­ti­gate the source of the virus, which was first de­tected in the cen­tral city of Wuhan last year.</p>
    <p>China has said it re­mains un­clear where the virus orig­i­nated and has re­jected an in­de­pen­dent probe, but re­it­er­ated that it is work­ing closely with WHO.</p>
    <p>The re­jec­tion of the de­mand for an in­de­pen­dent probe in a sense but­tresses Pres­i­dent Trump’s harsh crit­i­cism that WHO and China are joined at the hip in their re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Amer­ica’s exit will most par­tic­u­larly af­fect the devel­op­ing coun­tries and the ones that are chron­i­cally in the cusp of poverty, no­tably sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa.</p>
    <p>Will it im­pact Tai­wan’s WHO bid?</p>
    <p>Dou­glas Lee</p>
    <p>The China Post, Tai­wan</p>
    <p>The United States’ de­ci­sion has come un­der a mi­cro­scope as peo­ple are cu­ri­ous to un­der­stand the im­pli­ca­tions of this de­ci­sion on Tai­wan’s WHO bid.</p>
    <p>The US de­ci­sion will cause WHO to be­come more re­liant on China. Since Washington is cur­rently the largest donor to the health agency, its with­drawal will leave a mas­sive void that Bei­jing can fill in.</p>
    <p>This can be seen in the sit­u­a­tion in the past few months.</p>
    <p>Al­though the US has been ex­ert­ing pres­sure on WHO to be­come more in­de­pen­dent from</p>
    <p>China, WHO has only be­come closer to China. This will al­low China to be in the driver’s seat in com­bat­ing fu­ture pan­demics.</p>
    <p>China’s re­la­tions have been much more pos­i­tive with WHO over the past few months.</p>
    <p>Be­ing the next leader of WHO, China can con­tinue to pres­sure the agency to not in­vite Tai­wan to fu­ture World Health As­sem­blies.</p>
    <p>On the US front, the with­drawal will also have se­ri­ous im­pli­ca­tions on Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>First, US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s de­ci­sion has split US law­mak­ers along party lines, mak­ing it not only harder for them to co­op­er­ate on do­mes­tic is­sues but also on is­sues such as spon­sor­ing leg­is­la­tion to in­crease Tai­wan’s par­tic­i­pa­tion on the in­ter­na­tional level.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, the leader of the coali­tion that had been de­mand­ing Tai­wan’s in­clu­sion in the agency will no longer be in the agency it­self.</p>
    <p>While it is true that the US has many al­lies that can still fight for Tai­wan’s par­tic­i­pa­tion in the agency, Mr Trump’s de­ci­sion has only iso­lated these coun­tries.</p>
    <p>With­out the US, which cur­rently serves as the strong uni­fy­ing force and leader of the pro-Tai­wan bloc, calls for Tai­wan’s par­tic­i­pa­tion will be largely si­lenced.</p>
