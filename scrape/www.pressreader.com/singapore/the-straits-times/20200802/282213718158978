    <p>Top on com­mu­ni­ca­tions spe­cial­ist Joscelin Kwek’s wish­list was a sta­ble cor­po­rate job with reg­u­lar hours, which would give her time to take Mas­ter of Busi­ness Ad­min­is­tra­tion classes in the evenings.</p>
    <p>But in Jan­uary this year, it was an­nounced that the com­pany she worked for – an off­shoot of a bou­tique pub­lic re­la­tions firm – would be dis­solved, and all her best-laid plans went awry.</p>
    <p>The 38-year-old was in­formed that she – and seven other mem­bers of her team, who are in their 20s – would be out of a job in less than two months.</p>
    <p>En­ter a change of plans.</p>
    <p>Ms Kwek started her own com­mu­ni­ca­tions agency, Muse & Mo­tif, in Fe­bru­ary, and hired her en­tire pre­vi­ous team.</p>
    <p>Call­ing her­self an “ac­ci­den­tal en­tre­pre­neur”, she says: “The dis­so­lu­tion of the com­pany was a set­back, but also an op­por­tu­nity. I found the con­vic­tion to try something I never had the courage to at­tempt before, which is to start a busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“In the past, I lived in a com­fort­able fa­mil­iar­ity, so I did not con­sider other pos­si­bil­i­ties apart from an in-house cor­po­rate com­mu­ni­ca­tions po­si­tion.”</p>
    <p>Ms Kwek also felt re­spon­si­ble for her team mem­bers.</p>
    <p>“As their leader, I felt I had to do something. They are young and for some, it was just their first or sec­ond job. I wanted them to know that they were let go not be­cause they were in­ca­pable or not val­ued,” she says.</p>
    <p>“I also wanted to en­sure there was con­ti­nu­ity in the work for our clients.”</p>
    <p>Apart from hav­ing zero ex­pe­ri­ence in man­ag­ing a busi­ness, Ms Kwek, who is mar­ried with two young sons, ad­mits she is also highly risk-averse. “I am some­one who needs a clear con­struc­tive plan before I can move for­ward on something.”</p>
    <p>What she has, though, is more than a decade of busi­ness and personal con­tacts – from for­mer bosses and en­tre­pre­neur friends to church lead­ers and a personal ad­viser. After con­sult­ing them, she de­cided to take the plunge.</p>
    <p>Mr Wil­liam Chin, the founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of on­line mar­ket­place Mum­mys Mar­ket, which or­gan­ises mother-and-baby care prod­uct ex­hi­bi­tions, also came on­board as a share­holder and co-di­rec­tor, which made it fi­nan­cially pos­si­ble for Ms Kwek to hire all seven of her ex-col­leagues. Five are still with Muse & Mo­tif to­day.</p>
    <p>One of them, Mr Ni­cholas Chew, 26, says: “I was touched by her de­ci­sion to set up a new com­pany and keep us em­ployed. I was also re­lieved I still had a job.”</p>
    <p>He re­calls her lead­ing the team around the Cen­tral Busi­ness Dis­trict to view of­fice spa­ces. “The team be­came closer from the ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>Ms Kwek started prepa­ra­tions for Muse & Mo­tif when they were serv­ing no­tice at their old com­pany. By mid-Fe­bru­ary, the new busi­ness was ready for op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Muse & Mo­tif found a home at OCBC Centre and its clients in­clude Arts House Lim­ited, the Na­tional Vol­un­teer & Phi­lan­thropy Centre and food com­pany Nissin.</p>
    <p>The busi­ness is cur­rently prof­itable with a seven-digit rev­enue.</p>
    <p>Ms Kwek says: “I wouldn’t say my com­pany has tasted suc­cess yet. But busi­ness has been im­prov­ing and I think this is be­cause my team has worked re­ally hard to carry us through this dif­fi­cult time, with the pan­demic and all. I also got to know them bet­ter as sub­or­di­nates and friends.”</p>
    <p>She has yet to em­bark on her MBA as her busy sched­ule does not al­low her to com­mit to long-term stud­ies, but has been able to take some short cour­ses in con­tract law and sus­tain­able busi­ness strat­egy.</p>
    <p>“I am grate­ful for the guid­ance and wis­dom im­parted to me dur­ing this jour­ney – be it from my fam­ily, Wil­liam, the team or clients.”</p>
