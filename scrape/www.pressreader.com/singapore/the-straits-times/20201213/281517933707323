    <p>Christ­mas is muted in a pan­demic year, with wor­ship­pers mouthing car­ols be­hind masks, as no live singing is al­lowed in church.</p>
    <p>Gone are the glitzy song-and­dance shows, sump­tu­ous buf­fets and street light-ups staged by churches for their an­nual throngs of guests.</p>
    <p>In place of these ex­trav­a­gan­zas are hum­bler, home-cen­tred pizza spreads or watch par­ties for five.</p>
    <p>Such safe-dis­tanc­ing sea changes wrought by Covid-19 are stark at St An­drew’s Cathe­dral, which had never be­fore closed its doors in 160 years, not even dur­ing the dark­est days of World War II.</p>
    <p>Yet Chris­tians are find­ing il­lu­mi­nat­ing ways to cel­e­brate safely and em­bed beloved car­ols in wor­ship.</p>
    <p>A trio of cre­atives filmed a halfhour video of car­ols and Bible read­ings in a chapel, for Chris­tians across de­nom­i­na­tions to stream in church or at home on Christ­mas Eve.</p>
    <p>COM­ING HOME</p>
    <p>Many churches, big and small, have also launched Christ­mas-ath­ome fes­tiv­i­ties, in­ti­mate events con­nect­ing peo­ple around a ta­ble.</p>
    <p>“Home” is now the de­fault con­cept, with vari­a­tions such as Christ­mas@Home (City Har­vest Church) and Come To The Ta­ble (Cor­ner­stone Com­mu­nity Church).</p>
    <p>The 8,000-strong Faith Com­mu­nity Bap­tist Church calls it I’ll Be Home For Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>For years, it went big with sleek drama pro­duc­tions and a street light-up at its Marine Pa­rade lo­cale. But this time, the con­gre­ga­tion will in­vite friends home for a pre-recorded “party” hosted on YouTube by se­nior pas­tor Daniel Khong.</p>
    <p>He will lead ev­ery­one in a ses­sion of games, car­ols and thanks­giv­ing, and also share a Christ­mas mes­sage. To be rolled out from this Fri­day, this vir­tual party will be colos­sal yet cosy, struc­tured for peo­ple to in­ter­act in real time, with­out feel­ing com­pelled to keep up with what is hap­pen­ing on-screen.</p>
    <p>He says: “With the pan­demic, many things we have be­come used to had to change, from the way our ser­vices are run to how our venues are used.De­spite all that, we can still be a com­mu­nity. We just needed to find dif­fer­ent ways to con­nect.”</p>
    <p>Cor­ner­stone Com­mu­nity Church, where mu­si­cals used to be the main­stay in con­vey­ing the Christ­mas mes­sage, has crafted a new Come To The Ta­ble plat­form to kick-start con­ver­sa­tions about faith.</p>
    <p>Church mem­bers are en­cour­aged to in­vite guests to their homes or out­side for meals. They get starter packs which in­clude tips to en­gage guests, plus lists of eater­ies to help sup­port lo­cal busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>They can also tap short videos that re-en­act pan­demic chal­lenges, in­clud­ing the story of a con­gre­ga­tion mem­ber who over­came Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Ex­ec­u­tive pas­tor Lim Lip Yong hopes his 5,500 parish­ioners will con­nect with those around them per­son­ally, per­haps over a cup of cof­fee or an ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>“While we may be phys­i­cally dis­tanced, we can still build deeper bonds with those who may have gone through a chal­leng­ing year,” he says.</p>
    <p>“With scaled-down cel­e­bra­tions and ac­tiv­i­ties, we can scale up in­stead on things that mean a whole lot more – mu­tual care, sup­port and sol­i­dar­ity.”</p>
    <p>HY­BRID SER­VICES</p>
    <p>Mean­while, St John’s-St Mar­garet’s Church is de­lighted that the cap on at­ten­dance has been raised to 200 in time for Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>Its vicar, Dr Joshua Sud­har­man, says: “We be­lieve this is a sig­nif­i­cant op­por­tu­nity to sig­nal that even though on­line wor­ship can help plug the gap in a pan­demic, it can­not sat­is­fac­to­rily re­place con­gre­ga­tional wor­ship.”</p>
    <p>For the home-bound, small teams will bring Holy Com­mu­nion and Christ­mas cheer.</p>
    <p>Over at City Har­vest Church, a hy­brid of on-site and on­line events for its 16,000 mem­bers has been planned.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the Christ­mas week­end, mem­bers of the megachurch will gather phys­i­cally for ser­vices at Sun­tec City for the first time since March, with a cap of 100 wor­ship­pers at each ser­vice.</p>
    <p>In par­al­lel, watch par­ties will be ar­ranged at home for guests to en­joy a light meal and watch the es­er­vice to­gether.</p>
    <p>Fi­nal-year Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic stu­dent Amanda Loo, 19, a church youth leader, says mem­bers of her cell group will split up into groups of five and gather at dif­fer­ent homes for games and gift ex­changes.</p>
    <p>“We can’t wait to see how Christ­mas will un­fold this year,” she says.</p>
    <p>“Gath­er­ing in a smaller group is an op­por­tu­nity to draw closer. 2020 ac­tu­ally taught us that re­la­tion­ships are not re­stricted by phys­i­cal dis­tance. We can con­nect any­time and any­where to cel­e­brate Je­sus through tech­nol­ogy.”</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, cell groups are the glue for churches whose mem­bers dis­persed dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>City Har­vest has seen its cell groups “thriv­ing”, with nonchurch­go­ing fam­ily mem­bers be­gin­ning to join on­line ser­vices from home for the first time.</p>
    <p>Its ex­ec­u­tive pas­tor Bobby Chaw says lives can be touched any­where and “not just in a phys­i­cal build­ing”.</p>
    <p>He adds: “We know the spirit of Christ­mas is alive and well among mem­bers of City Har­vest.”</p>
    <p>Smaller churches can be more flex­i­ble in ad­just­ing to a cur­tailed Christ­mas, says lead pas­tor Vin­cent Lee from Live For Eter­nity Church.</p>
    <p>To be­gin with, there are no flashy pro­grammes. Two ser­vices can ac­com­mo­date his flock of 80 to 100 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“The feed­back is that at­tend­ing in per­son is dif­fer­ent from at­tend­ing an on­line ser­vice. Mem­bers feel the bond­ing of fam­ily as we gather in church,” he says.</p>
    <p>This con­nec­tion will be prized at Christ­mas – although, in­stead of min­gling over the usual buf­fet lunch, small groups of five will head to malls near the Ou­tram church for a meal.</p>
    <p>He re­flects: “This Christ­mas will be quiet, like when Je­sus came al­most 2,000 years ago.”</p>
    <p>What has not changed, pan­demic or not, is that his church still helps debtors through a so­cial agency.</p>
    <p>REACH­ING OUT</p>
    <p>As the re­ces­sion deep­ens, churches say reach­ing out to the vul­ner­a­ble is more sig­nif­i­cant than ever.</p>
    <p>Be­cause City Har­vest Church can­not put on mass shows this year, it has de­ployed its pro­duc­tion bud­get to a Care Fund to sup­port hard-hit church mem­bers and their fam­i­lies. A to­tal of 162 in­di­vid­u­als were sup­ported this year.</p>
    <p>St An­drew’s Cathe­dral has on­line classes for mi­grant work­ers and tends to a spec­trum of el­derly parish­ioners. While some se­niors have picked up dig­i­tal skills to tithe on­line and Zoom into small-group meet­ings, the house-bound have started to re­ceive vis­its again.</p>
    <p>Other churches such as St John’s-St Mar­garet’s Church and Amaz­ing Grace Pres­by­te­rian Church send Christ­mas care packs to res­i­dents in their re­spec­tive Dover and Kem­ban­gan-Chai Chee neigh­bour­hoods.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren and youth are also roped in to cel­e­brate the mean­ing of Christ­mas, safely.</p>
    <p>At Amaz­ing Grace Pres­by­te­rian Church, kids in Sun­day school and their par­ents are en­cour­aged to in­vite up to five neigh­bour­hood chil­dren or friends to their home to join church-or­gan­ised on­line Christ­mas sto­ry­telling, which is pack­aged with an arts and crafts ses­sion.</p>
    <p>The Faith Com­mu­nity Bap­tist Church has filmed Christ­mas Un­boxed, an orig­i­nal five-episode va­ri­ety show for kids on its YouTube chan­nel.</p>
    <p>City Har­vest has also delved into a 22-week on­line Bible study with se­nior pas­tor and founder Kong Hee.</p>
    <p>The fo­cus of the church now is to grow into “spir­i­tual ma­tu­rity” with such deep dives, says Pas­tor Chaw from the church.</p>
    <p>“It is an en­deav­our that may not have re­ceived as much at­ten­tion if we were not all work­ing from home and ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a travel freeze,” he adds.</p>
    <p>It has been a “dark and dif­fi­cult year for many”, re­flects Dr Steven Gan, se­nior min­is­ter at Amaz­ing Grace Pres­by­te­rian, but he prays that Christ­mas will bring ra­di­ance. He cites a Bible verse about Christ­mas: “The peo­ple who walked in dark­ness have seen a great light.”</p>
    <p>St An­drew’s Cathe­dral, the old­est Angli­can place of wor­ship in Sin­ga­pore, will have both livestream­ed and on-site ser­vices for Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>Look­ing back, Ms Vivien Chen, di­rec­tor of ad­min­is­tra­tion and op­er­a­tions, says: “The cathe­dral re­mained open to all, through all the vi­cis­si­tudes of life in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>This is the first year in its his­tory the church has been phys­i­cally closed, ex­cept for ser­vices.</p>
    <p>While this Christ­mas is qui­eter, the church bells will still ring at the end of its Christ­mas Eve and New Year’s Eve ser­vices, af­ter mid­night.</p>
    <p>The bells will also chime car­ols for half an hour from 10pm on Christ­mas Eve. “Peo­ple in the civic district will be able to hear them,” she says.</p>
    <p>Mu­sic is “in­dis­pens­able at Christ­mas”, says Ven­er­a­ble Wong Tak Meng, who rep­re­sents 27 Angli­can churches. This year, it will play on in the form of pre-recorded vir­tual choirs and wor­ship bands.</p>
    <p>Angli­can mu­si­cian-song­writer cou­ple Earnest Lau and Tan Ming Li have recorded a 30-minute on­line carol ser­vice of songs and Bible read­ings, so any­one can have a time of “quiet thanks­giv­ing and sa­cred re­flec­tion”, de­spite Covid-19 re­stric­tions on big gath­er­ings and singing. It will pre­miere on YouTube and Vimeo on Christ­mas Eve at noon.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sion­ally shot at the St John’s-St Mar­garet’s Church by film-maker Clare Chao, 22, the mul­ti­me­dia mo­ments are in­ti­mate and nat­u­ral.</p>
    <p>The project is very dif­fer­ent from the bright lights and “hec­tic-vity” the trio them­selves ex­pe­ri­enced in Christ­mases past.</p>
    <p>Mr Lau, 52, says: “We sing sim­ply, qui­etly. The scrip­tures are read from the pews. This is the chapel spilling into the house.”</p>
