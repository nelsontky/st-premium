    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) • Paul George has been the butt of jokes through­out the Western Con­fer­ence play­off open­ing-round series.</p>
    <p>The All-Star is known to re­fer to him­self as “Play-off P” – a nod to hav­ing never failed to make the post-sea­son in his 10 sea­sons in the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA), ex­cept in 2015 due to a bro­ken leg.</p>
    <p>But while George is one of the NBA’s elite play­ers, he has never won a cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>With Fi­nals Most Valu­able Player Kawhi Leonard join­ing the Los An­ge­les Clip­pers l ast sum­mer and George leav­ing the Ok­la­homa City Thun­der at the same time, the star duo had been ex­pected to turn the Clip­pers, who have never gone past the West Fi­nals, into in­stant con­tenders.</p>
    <p>Ex­cept it has not quite worked out that way. The Dal­las Mav­er­icks have per­formed at a level that be­lies their sev­enth seed­ing, tak­ing two games off the sec­ond-seeded Clip­pers.</p>
    <p>And prior to Tues­day, George had shot 10-for-47 over­all, lead­ing ne­ti­zens and l eague great Charles Barkley to roast the for­ward.</p>
    <p>“You can’t be call­ing your­self Play-off P and los­ing all the time,” he said. “You don’t see me walk­ing around say­ing, ‘I won a cham­pi­onship’ and I didn’t win it’. They don’t call me cham­pi­onship Chuck.”</p>
    <p>But in Game 5, with the Clip­pers at the cross­roads of their series at two games apiece, George fi­nally came up big, scor­ing a team-high 35 points in a crush­ing 154-111 win.</p>
    <p>Be­hind their two best play­ers, Los An­ge­les set fran­chise play-off records for the most points, three­p­oint­ers (22-of-35) and shoot­ing per­cent­age (63.1).</p>
    <p>Af­ter­wards, George claimed he had been in a “dark place”, but had fi­nally got rid of the demons af­ter speak­ing to a team ther­a­pist and was ready to help the Clip­pers live up to their favourites tag.</p>
    <p>“The bub­ble got the best of me,” he said. “I wasn’t here, I checked out. I was just in a bad place. I found my way. I am back and I look for­ward to the rest of this run. A shout out to peo­ple that stood be­hind me and were in my cor­ner.</p>
    <p>“It was hard to get into play-off mode with no in­ten­sity, no fans, and no at­mos­phere. We cre­ated the en­ergy. I came in with the at­ti­tude that this is Sta­ples Arena and the place is packed. I had to cre­ate my own en­ergy.”</p>
    <p>Leonard fin­ished with 32 points, while team­mate Mon­trezl Har­rell added 19 points and 11 re­bounds off the bench.</p>
    <p>Reign­ing Rookie of the Year Luka Don­cic paced the Mav­er­icks, who were miss­ing the in­jured Kristaps Porzingis for the sec­ond straight game, with 22 points.</p>
    <p>The frus­tra­tion told as Dal­las coach Rick Carlisle was ejected for ar­gu­ing with of­fi­cials mid­way through the third quar­ter. Game 6 is to­day, with the Clip­pers lead­ing 3-2 and need­ing just one more vic­tory to elim­i­nate their op­po­nents.</p>
    <p>In the other play-off game in the West, Ja­mal Mur­ray had 42 points as Den­ver stayed alive with a 117-107 vic­tory over the Utah Jazz in Game 5. The Nuggets trail 3-2 ahead of Game 6 to­day.</p>
    <p>UP AND FIR­ING AGAIN</p>
    <p>The bub­ble got the best of me. I wasn’t here, I checked out. I was just in a bad place. I found my way. I am back and I look for­ward to the rest of this run.</p>
