    <p>Thai­land’s yel­low-shirted roy­al­ists came out in force to show sup­port for King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn yes­ter­day, as the Par­lia­ment met for a sec­ond day to weigh a pro­posal to set up a com­mit­tee to ex­plore ways to end the coun­try’s months-long anti-gov­ern­ment protests.</p>
    <p>BANGKOK • More than 1,000 yel­low-shirt Thai roy­al­ists demon­strated in sup­port of King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn yes­ter­day, close to where thou­sands of peo­ple had marched a day ear­lier to de­mand re­forms of the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>Youth and stu­dent-led protests be­gan in Thai­land in July to call for the res­ig­na­tion of Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha – a for­mer army ruler – and a new Con­sti­tu­tion, but have in­creas­ingly sought curbs on the monar­chy’s pow­ers.</p>
    <p>“We want to show sup­port and en­cour­age­ment to His Majesty,” said Mr Thatcha­pan Bo­riphet, 57, at Lumphini Park in cen­tral Bangkok. “I am neu­tral po­lit­i­cally but I can­not stand it when there is a vi­o­la­tion of the monar­chy.”</p>
    <p>So far, roy­al­ist demon­stra­tions have been con­sid­er­ably smaller than the tens of thou­sands of peo­ple who have joined the big­gest protests against the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers have ac­cused the King of po­lit­i­cal in­volve­ment and marched to the Ger­man Em­bassy on Mon­day to seek an in­quiry into whether he ex­er­cised his pow­ers dur­ing long stays in Ger­many, some­thing Ber­lin has said would be un­ac­cept­able.</p>
    <p>The palace has a pol­icy of not com­ment­ing to the me­dia and has made no com­ment since the start of the protests. The King is in Thai­land.</p>
    <p>Roy­al­ists took heart at the week­end when the King lauded as “very brave” a man who had de­fied pro­test­ers by hold­ing up a pic­ture of the late King Bhu­mi­bol Adulyadej, but the re­ac­tion of pro­test­ers has been scathing.</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut has ig­nored demands to quit and said the cri­sis should be dis­cussed in Par­lia­ment, where his sup­port­ers are in the ma­jor­ity, dur­ing an emer­gency ses­sion on Mon­day and yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In Par­lia­ment, Thai law­mak­ers are weigh­ing a pro­posal to set up a com­mit­tee to ex­plore ways to end the protests.</p>
    <p>A work­ing group is look­ing at a panel pro­posed by Deputy Pre­mier Jurin Lak­sanaw­isit, House Speaker Chuan Leek­pai said yes­ter­day, with Par­lia­ment set to wrap up the spe­cial two-day ses­sion.</p>
    <p>Pro-democ­racy groups vowed to stage more ral­lies if they did not like the re­sult from Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>“We’re as­sess­ing the sit­u­a­tion daily to plan our next move,” said Mr Jatu­pat Boon­pat­tararaksa, a protest leader. “We sub­mit­ted a let­ter to the Ger­man Em­bassy, so we’re still wait­ing for a re­sponse, and we still have to lis­ten to what the Par­lia­ment has to say to­day.”</p>
    <p>The pro­test­ers want Mr Prayut to re­sign, changes to a Con­sti­tu­tion writ­ten af­ter a 2014 coup and greater ac­count­abil­ity and trans­parency for the monar­chy – the most pow­er­ful in­sti­tu­tion in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>“The ses­sion was just a move to show that the gov­ern­ment is work­ing on find­ing so­lu­tions, but in fact they haven’t re­ally con­sid­ered the in­put from the pro­test­ers and the pub­lic,” said Dr Virot Ali, a lec­turer at Tham­masat Univer­sity’s Fac­ulty of Po­lit­i­cal Sci­ence.</p>
    <p>“A com­mit­tee that would be set up likely won’t re­sult in any­thing. It won’t de-es­ca­late the protest move­ment.”</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut has strug­gled to quell the protest move­ment, forc­ing him to with­draw a state of emer­gency in the cap­i­tal within a week of its im­po­si­tion and ask­ing pro­test­ers to “take a step back” to de-es­ca­late the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Mr Prayut told Par­lia­ment that it can take up the char­ter amend­ment process next month and con­clude dis­cus­sions in De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion par­ties have told him that he should step down for the good of the coun­try and stop us­ing his pro­claimed sup­port for the monar­chy as an ar­gu­ment to keep power.</p>
    <p>His op­po­nents say he kept power in last year’s elec­tion only thanks to elec­toral rules and a Con­sti­tu­tion drawn up by the junta he headed af­ter the 2014 coup. He says that the bal­lot was fair.</p>
    <p>The sug­ges­tions of past rec­on­cil­i­a­tion com­mit­tees in Thai­land have largely gone ig­nored, in­clud­ing rec­om­men­da­tions is­sued af­ter a bloody crack­down on pro-democ­racy pro­test­ers in 2010.</p>
