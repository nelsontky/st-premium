    <p>IN­CREASE IN HEAT-RE­LATED DEATHS AMONG OLDER PEO­PLE IN PAST TWO DECADES, AC­CORD­ING TO THE LANCET’S RE­PORT ON THE LINKS BE­TWEEN HEALTH AND CLI­MATE |</p>
    <p>PARIS • From small is­land states to ur­banised pow­er­houses, ev­ery coun­try on earth faces “mul­ti­ply­ing and in­ten­si­fy­ing” threats to hu­man health as cli­mate change ren­ders fu­ture pan­demics and sys­tem col­lapses ever more likely, a ma­jor study con­cluded yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A deadly mix of ex­treme heat, air pol­lu­tion and in­tense farm­ing is pro­duc­ing the “worst out­look for pub­lic health our gen­er­a­tion has seen”, ac­cord­ing to the Lancet’s fifth an­nual re­port on the links be­tween health and cli­mate.</p>
    <p>The assess­ment showed that the past two decades have seen a 54 per cent in­crease in heat-re­lated deaths among older peo­ple, with ex­treme heat­waves claim­ing close to 300,000 lives in 2018 alone.</p>
    <p>While cli­mate-linked phe­nom­ena such as trop­i­cal storms re­main for now prob­lems over­whelm­ingly faced by de­vel­op­ing na­tions, the study’s au­thors said ex­treme heat was al­ready in­flict­ing dev­as­tat­ing dam­age on peo­ple’s health in wealth­ier coun­tries.</p>
    <p>In 2018, France alone ex­pe­ri­enced 8,000 heat-re­lated deaths among over-65s, in­flict­ing an eco­nomic cost equiv­a­lent to 1.3 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct that year, the re­port found.</p>
    <p>“The threats to hu­man health are mul­ti­ply­ing and in­ten­si­fy­ing due to cli­mate change and un­less we change course our health­care sys­tems are at risk of be­ing over­whelmed in the fu­ture,” said Mr Ian Hamil­ton, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Lancet Count­down re­port.</p>
    <p>Heat and drought are driv­ing sharp in­creases in hu­man ex­po­sure to wild­fires, with 128 coun­tries see­ing an in­crease in the pop­u­la­tion in­jured, killed or dis­placed by blazes since the early 2000s, the re­port found.</p>
    <p>It said that pro­jected sea level rises caused by fos­sil fuel, farm­ing and trans­port emis­sions could threaten to dis­place up to 565 mil­lion peo­ple by 2100, in turn ex­pos­ing them to a range of health prob­lems.</p>
    <p>With more than nine mil­lion deaths at­trib­ut­able to poor diet each year, the ex­pert panel be­hind the re­port found that mor­tal­ity linked to ex­cess red meat con­sump­tion had risen 70 per cent in just three decades.</p>
    <p>Ex­cess red meat eat­ing was be­hind at least 13,000 deaths in France in 2017, out of nearly 90,000 deaths that year at­trib­ut­able to poor diet.</p>
    <p>The au­thors warned that con­tin­ued ur­ban­i­sa­tion, in­ten­sive agri­cul­ture, air travel and life­styles pow­ered by fos­sil fu­els would ren­der fu­ture pan­demics such as Covid-19 far more likely.</p>
    <p>They called for ur­gent ac­tion to mit­i­gate emis­sions in or­der to stave off the worst ef­fects of cli­mate change and re­duce its im­pact as a health threat mul­ti­plier.</p>
    <p>“Now is the time for all of us to take the en­vi­ron­men­tal de­ter­mi­nants of health more se­ri­ously,” said The Lancet’s ed­i­tor-in-chief Richard Horton.</p>
    <p>“We must ad­dress the cli­mate emer­gency, pro­tect bio­di­ver­sity, and strengthen the nat­u­ral sys­tems on which our civil­i­sa­tion de­pends.”</p>
    <p>The re­port comes near the fiveyear an­niver­sary of the Paris cli­mate ac­cord, which en­joins na­tions to limit global tem­per­a­ture rises to well be­low 2 deg C above pre-in­dus­trial lev­els through sweep­ing emis­sions cuts.</p>
    <p>The agree­ment also en­vis­ages a safer warm­ing cap of 1.5 deg C.</p>
    <p>The Lancet panel called for an “align­ing of cli­mate and pan­demic re­cov­ery” to de­liver near- and long-term health and eco­nomic ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>It said that the health ben­e­fits from lower lev­els of air pol­lu­tion and fewer ex­treme weather events as well as im­proved di­ets alone would more than pay for the costs of cli­mate mit­i­ga­tion.</p>
