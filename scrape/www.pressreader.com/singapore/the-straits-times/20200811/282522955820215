    <p>Four years ago, Chanel Miller, still known as “Emily Doe” in the sex­ual as­sault case against Brock Turner, wrote a 12-page vic­tim im­pact state­ment so pow­er­ful that it went vi­ral on Buz­zFeed and landed her a ma­jor book deal.</p>
    <p>It also helped in­spire Mrs Hil­lary Clin­ton’s con­ces­sion speech – the part where she urged young girls never to doubt their value.</p>
    <p>Miller wrote the first draft of her state­ment through tears and anger in one sleep­less night in May 2016. But few of her sup­port­ers knew that the pre­vi­ous day, she had had an­other kind of cre­ative out­pour­ing.</p>
    <p>She spent hours with a black marker in hand, stand­ing in front of three white poster boards taped to a closet door, draw­ing as­sorted bushy-tailed, beaked and hu­manoid crea­tures rid­ing scoot­ers, bikes and ve­hi­cles of her in­ven­tion along a cir­cu­lar road.</p>
    <p>She cre­ated this whim­si­cal scene be­fore start­ing the ex­cru­ci­at­ing process of writ­ing the vic­tim im­pact state­ment – as a way of clear­ing her head and also re­con­nect­ing to a tal­ent that has been a source of strength since child­hood.</p>
    <p>“Draw­ing was a way for me to see that I was still there be­fore I went to a darker place again,” Miller, 28, said slowly and thought­fully by Zoom. “It’s like the rope to lower my­self is longer be­cause I can draw.”</p>
    <p>She was speak­ing from her apart­ment in New York, where she moved into with her long-time boyfriend the week be­fore the city is­sued a stay-at-home pan­demic or­der, giv­ing her more time for art-mak­ing.</p>
    <p>She made draw­ings she calls “joy­ful” at par­tic­u­larly try­ing mo­ments dur­ing the run-up to the 2016 trial of Turner, a former Stan­ford stu­dent who was found guilty of three felony charges for sex­u­ally as­sault­ing Miller when she was un­con­scious. He was sen­tenced to six months in prison, prompt­ing a pub­lic out­cry and wide­spread de­mand for the judge to be re­called.</p>
    <p>Miller re­turned to draw­ing reg­u­larly af­ter the trial, while writ­ing her award-win­ning 2019 mem­oir, Know My Name.</p>
    <p>This year, she pub­lished pan­demic-themed car­toons in Time and The New Yorker, ex­plor­ing the surge of racism against Asian Amer­i­cans and the emo­tional roller coaster of fac­ing a sud­denly empty sched­ule dur­ing lock­down.</p>
    <p>Now, she is mak­ing her mu­seum de­but with her big­gest work, a 23m-long mu­ral mark­ing themes of per­sonal trauma and heal­ing, on view at the Asian Art Mu­seum in San Fran­cisco. While still closed be­cause of Covid-19, the mu­seum has in­stalled her work in its new, glass-walled con­tem­po­rary-art gal­leries, vis­i­ble to pedes­tri­ans from Hyde Street.</p>
    <p>Miller, who is Chi­nese Amer­i­can and grew up in Palo Alto, Cal­i­for­nia, was ex­cited to get the in­vi­ta­tion from the mu­seum to work in this new space, a part of the in­sti­tu­tion’s US$38 mil­lion (S$52 mil­lion) reimag­in­ing and ex­pan­sion by ar­chi­tect Ku­la­pat Yantrasast.</p>
    <p>“I spent the first two decades of my life shying away from my Chi­nese her­itage, try­ing to be nor­mal, bland and main­stream, like so many kids do,” she said. “But this is a chance to em­brace that as­pect of my­self pub­licly. I also love that they are adding this con­tem­po­rary wing to ad­dress the here and now.”</p>
    <p>The vinyl mu­ral, I Was, I Am, I Will Be, printed from her draw­ing, con­sists of three pan­els show­ing a sim­ply ren­dered char­ac­ter – she says the perfectly cir­cu­lar nos­trils re­flect her Asian her­itage – on a jour­ney through phys­i­cal and emo­tional states.</p>
    <p>In the first panel, the some­what lumpy fig­ure is on the ground in a foetal po­si­tion, tears pool­ing. In the cen­tre, it is in a lo­tus po­si­tion and the tears have been trans­formed into an en­ergy field. Fi­nally, the fig­ure is stand­ing and ad­vanc­ing.</p>
    <p>The first im­age could eas­ily be read as a ref­er­ence to how Miller was found on the ground in 2015 out­side a Stan­ford fra­ter­nity by two grad­u­ate stu­dents on bi­cy­cles who wit­nessed Turner’s as­sault.</p>
    <p>But she says it is not quite that di­rect, rep­re­sent­ing “any state of be­ing re­signed”, she said. “My draw­ings are never about the as­sault, but how to live with it.”</p>
    <p>In the sum­mer fol­low­ing the as­sault, she left for Prov­i­dence, Rhode Is­land, to take a print-mak­ing course at the Rhode Is­land School of De­sign, where she cre­ated odd­ball an­i­mals like a two-headed rooster in­spired in part, she says, by the fan­tas­ti­cal menageries of Cana­dian artist Mar­cel Dzama.</p>
    <p>“I think of these lit­tle crea­tures as in­de­pen­dent of me,” she said of her draw­ings. “If I’m not tak­ing care of my­self and giv­ing them the time and space to emerge, then they have to sit with their arms crossed in­side me where it’s murky and hu­man.”</p>
    <p>That sum­mer, strug­gling to func­tion and sleep, she drew two bi­cy­cles and taped it over her bed “to re­mind my­self that there was a point in time when two peo­ple knew for a fact that I de­served to be pro­tected, even if I didn’t un­der­stand how to help my­self”.</p>
    <p>Later, she drew the faces of the ju­rors who found Turner guilty as a “way to doc­u­ment these peo­ple who saw me and bore wit­ness to my story and spit me out in a place where I knew I would be able to re­cover”.</p>
