    <p>Four coronaviru­s pa­tients linked to a clus­ter at Bukit Pan­jang In­te­grated Trans­port Hub are all bus driv­ers, said trans­port op­er­a­tor SMRT yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The clus­ter was first an­nounced by the Min­istry of Health (MOH) last Fri­day night.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to SMRT, three of the driv­ers con­tracted Covid-19 in their house­holds.</p>
    <p>The last driver, a 28-year-old Malaysian work per­mit holder, was con­firmed pos­i­tive last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>MOH said last Fri­day that his in­fec­tion was de­tected as part of the min­istry’s proac­tive case-find­ing of in­di­vid­u­als work­ing at a newly emer­gent work­place clus­ter, adding that his re­sults in­di­cated that he was likely to have a past in­fec­tion and was no longer in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the worker showed symp­toms on July 1 and sub­se­quently went to work at Ulu Pan­dan Bus De­pot and Bukit Pan­jang In­te­grated Trans­port Hub.</p>
    <p>When asked, SMRT was un­able to say for how long the driver con­tin­ued work­ing af­ter he showed symp­toms.</p>
    <p>All four driv­ers tested pos­i­tive be­tween July 7 and July 24, said SMRT.</p>
    <p>They drove bus ser­vices 976, 184 and 176.</p>
    <p>SMRT chief com­mu­ni­ca­tions of­fi­cer Mar­garet Teo said the com­pany is closely mon­i­tor­ing the driv­ers’ con­di­tions and of­fer­ing help to their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>She added that SMRT’s em­ploy­ees who were in close con­tact with the four driv­ers have been placed on leave of ab­sence.</p>
    <p>A Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA) spokesman also said SMRT is as­sist­ing MOH with con­tact trac­ing, as well as dis­in­fect­ing buses</p>
    <p>Mr Ting was under 21 at the time, so his mother, Madam Dolly Quek Mui Choo, was named as his lit­i­ga­tion rep­re­sen­ta­tive.</p>
    <p>He as­serted that Madam Ang failed to keep a proper look­out for his e-scooter, failed to heed his “loud oral warn­ing” to keep away and was reck­less to have dashed out with­out en­sur­ing it was safe to do so.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong told ST that he filed the suit as a last re­sort be­cause Mr Ting and his fam­ily re­fused to pay any com­pen­sa­tion be­yond the sum of $2,470.65 or­dered in the crim­i­nal pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong, who earns $2,000 to $3,000 a month, said the cost of Madam Ang’s med­i­cal treatment and care re­mains sub­stan­tial de­spite govern­ment sub­si­dies. His three chil­dren are aged be­tween 20 and 30.</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment passed changes to the law in Fe­bru­ary to en­hance pun­ish­ment for er­rant users of e-scoot­ers and other ac­tive mobility de­vices. All mo­torised per­sonal mobility de­vices (PMDs) were also banned from foot­paths from April.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral MPs also called for com­pul­sory third-party li­a­bil­ity in­sur­ance for all PMD rid­ers to bet­ter pro­tect ac­ci­dent vic­tims.</p>
    <p>Then Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Trans­port Janil Puthuc­heary told Par­lia­ment that cer­tain busi­nesses like food de­liv­ery com­pa­nies will be re­quired to en­sure their rid­ers are cov­ered by third-party li­a­bil­ity in­sur­ance. He added that the min­istry is look­ing into how to ex­tend such re­quire­ments to in­di­vid­ual rid­ers.</p>
