    <p>LON­DON • The Haas For­mula One team con­demned new sign­ing Nikita Mazepin for “ab­hor­rent” be­hav­iour yes­ter­day, af­ter the young Rus­sian posted and then deleted a video in which he groped a female pas­sen­ger in a car.</p>
    <p>The clip, first posted in an In­sta­gram story, con­tin­ued to cir­cu­late on­line af­ter its re­moval.</p>
    <p>“Haas F1 team does not con­done the be­hav­iour of Nikita Mazepin in the video re­cently posted on his so­cial me­dia,” the team said in a state­ment from Abu Dhabi, where they are pre­par­ing for the fi­nal race of the sea­son on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>“Ad­di­tion­ally, the very fact that the video was posted on so­cial me­dia is also ab­hor­rent to Haas F1 team,” it added, say­ing the mat­ter was be­ing dealt with in­ter­nally.</p>
    <p>Mazepin, son of a Rus­sian bil­lion­aire who made his for­tune in fer­tilis­ers, apol­o­gised on Twit­ter for his “in­ap­pro­pri­ate be­hav­iour” and the fact that the video was posted.</p>
    <p>“I am sorry for the of­fence I have rightly caused and to the em­bar­rass­ment I have brought to Haas F1 team,” added the 21-year-old.</p>
    <p>“I have to hold my­self to a higher stan­dard as a For­mula One driver and I ac­knowl­edge I have let my­self and many peo­ple down. I prom­ise I will learn from this.”</p>
    <p>The woman in the video, model An­drea D’lVal, shared her own state­ment on In­sta­gram, in­sist­ing that she and Mazepin are “good friends”, that the video was a “joke” and she was the one who posted it on his story. She added that “he would never do any­thing to hurt or hu­mil­i­ate me”.</p>
    <p>Last week, Mazepin was named as a Haas driver for 2021 along with Mick Schu­macher, son of seven-time world cham­pion Michael.</p>
    <p>While Schu­macher won the For­mula Two ti­tle in Bahrain at the week­end, Mazepin was handed two penal­ties for forc­ing one ri­val off track and block­ing an­other.</p>
    <p>He fin­ished the F2 sea­son fifth over­all, enough to gain an F1 su­per­li­cence.</p>
    <p>He also stood out for ac­cru­ing 11 penalty points, one short of trig­ger­ing a ban.</p>
    <p>Haas team prin­ci­pal Gun­ther Steiner said the penal­ties were part of learn­ing. “These things hap­pen when your brain goes away,” he added.</p>
