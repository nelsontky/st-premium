    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, Nanyang Sauce owner Ken Koh did the food de­liv­er­ies him­self.</p>
    <p>The sud­den shut­down hit his food and bev­er­age busi­ness hard be­cause he had Malaysian work­ers who were stuck on the other side of the Cause­way.</p>
    <p>Over a drink at his shop in South Bridge Road, the 36-year-old says sim­ply: “If we want to sur­vive, we have to take the load.”</p>
    <p>Food re­tail is not even his core busi­ness. He started an eatery, which sells braised chicken, as a way of show­cas­ing his fam­ily’s hand­made soya sauces and he has learnt some hard lessons along the way.</p>
    <p>The first it­er­a­tion of Nanyang Chicken was in a shop­house and he ad­mits: “The space was a lit­tle too big for us to han­dle.”</p>
    <p>His cur­rent shop is lit­er­ally a hole-in-the-wall with just enough space for a tiny kitchen dis­pens­ing braised and curry chicken, a counter with two so­cially dis­tanced high seats, and three ta­bles on an out­side walk­way.</p>
    <p>His de­ter­mi­na­tion to keep his fam­ily’s busi­ness alive is pal­pa­ble as he talks about the tra­di­tional way his com­pany still brews soya sauce. While com­mer­cial soya sauce is made the quick way with hy­drochlo­ric acid and vegetable pro­tein, Nanyang Sauce mixes non-GMO soya beans with wheat flour and as­pergillus mould be­fore the mix­ture is fer­mented nat­u­rally un­der the sun in gi­ant vats.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh re­lates with pride how, when he vis­ited a 250-year-old soya sauce fac­tory in Ja­pan, its 72-year-old soya sauce mas­ter was shocked when Mr Koh shared a video of the way Nanyang Sauce makes its sauce. “He said, ‘This is how I used to make sauce as a 16-year-old.’”</p>
    <p>Mod­ern au­to­mated pro­cesses use de­fat­ted soya beans be­cause fat can jam up the ma­chines. At Nanyang Sauce, work­ers still mix whole soya beans by hand be­fore de­cant­ing them into vats for the nine-month fer­men­ta­tion process.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh stepped in to take over the busi­ness three years ago be­cause “no­body wanted to take over”. He grew up in the fac­tory, play­ing among the soya sauce vats and rear­ing chick­ens and fish, be­fore go­ing on to study busi­ness at Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>His mother has helped out at the fac­tory since she was 16, and his 94-year-old grand­mother still goes to work there. His grand­fa­ther died at work from a heart at­tack when Mr Koh was 12 years old, so he feels a deep at­tach­ment to the busi­ness where three gen­er­a­tions have lived and worked.</p>
    <p>It was a typ­i­cal small fam­ily en­ter­prise set-up with no mar­ket­ing depart­ment, he re­calls wryly.</p>
    <p>“No­body knew about us. When we first came out, peo­ple were ask­ing, ‘Are you fake?’” he says.</p>
    <p>His so­lu­tion was to go to the In­tel­lec­tual Prop­erty Of­fice of Sin­ga­pore to un­earth the 1962 stamp reg­is­tered to the com­pany to prove its prove­nance. Part of the rea­son Nanyang Sauce was so un­der the radar was be­cause it sup­plied mainly to old-school gro­cery stores and hawker stalls and many of those busi­nesses were clos­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh found new ways to pro­mote the soya sauces.</p>
    <p>A Hong Kong cus­tomer who walked into his East Coast sauce bou­tique one day to ask for soya sauce salt helped him raise funds for new equip­ment for the fac­tory.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh had no idea the salt crys­tals left over in his soya sauce vats were worth any­thing. “If he told me it was worth $1, I would have sold it for $1.”</p>
    <p>In­stead, the salt, aged 10 years, was the cen­tre­piece of a Kick­starter cam­paign which helped him raise more than $70,000. There are still limited jars, which are sold in a gift box priced at $68 each.</p>
    <p>“Gift­ing is big for us. It’s a blue ocean,” says Mr Koh. He de­clines to re­veal the pri­vately owned com­pany’s an­nual turnover, say­ing mod­estly: “It’s so small, peo­ple will laugh at us.”</p>
    <p>He jokes that he does not drive a Rolls-Royce, but a Volk­swa­gen Polo. “We are poor, but we take pride in what we do.”</p>
    <p>He sees po­ten­tial for growth, given cur­rent trends in Sin­ga­pore and the world. Younger food­ies, he notes, are far more health-con­scious and aware of the prove­nance of the food prod­ucts they con­sume, so his com­pany’s ar­ti­sanal roots give its prod­ucts an edge.</p>
    <p>The by-prod­uct of the sauce­mak­ing process has also of­fered an un­ex­pected rev­enue stream. The lees, sim­i­lar to okara, which the com­pany once sold to pig farm­ers, now goes to com­pa­nies hop­ing to make the next meat sub­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh is brim­ming with ideas for the sauces too. While he is in­tent on keep­ing the old-school la­bels, he is us­ing his shop as an “R&D” out­let to test new prod­ucts. He has a soya sauce ice cream, which will be in­tro­duced in a 100ml-cup of­fer­ing at the end of the year. An­other prod­uct, a soya sauce cake, will also be launched soon.</p>
    <p>He is also hop­ing to ex­pand his fac­tory and that the Govern­ment’s push to in­crease lo­cal food pro­duc­tion will help his com­pany grow in the com­ing years.</p>
    <p>He is re­al­is­tic about the changes that will be nec­es­sary to keep the busi­ness rel­e­vant in the mod­ern age. “You can make a very good qual­ity prod­uct, but you also need to make it fi­nan­cially vi­able.”</p>
    <p>But his fam­ily’s his­tory and her­itage mean he will try his best to keep it alive. “This is tribal knowl­edge. Once it’s gone, it’s gone.”</p>
    <p>The video is part of Made In Sin­ga­pore, a se­ries of videos pro­duced by Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings in part­ner­ship with the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Author­ity (IMDA), as part of IMDA’s Public Ser­vice Broad­cast ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond sea­son of Made In Sin­ga­pore cel­e­brates the en­tre­pre­neur­ial spirit of Sin­ga­pore­ans who de­sign and hand­craft goods, mak­ing a busi­ness out of what they love.</p>
