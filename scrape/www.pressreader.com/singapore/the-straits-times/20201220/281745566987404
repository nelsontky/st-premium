    <p>BRUS­SELS • Euro­pean Union and Bri­tish ne­go­tia­tors held “tech­ni­cal talks” in Brus­sels yes­ter­day with no sign of them break­ing an im­passe over post-Brexit fish­ing rights in time to save a trade deal.</p>
    <p>Sources on both sides said fish­ing is now the main ob­sta­cle to any pact that could be in place on Jan 1 to pre­vent a sud­den re­turn to tar­iffs that would deal an eco­nomic jolt to both sides of the Chan­nel.</p>
    <p>“It re­mains very blocked,” one EU diplo­mat told Agence FrancePres­se.</p>
    <p>An­other said Brus­sels had made Bri­tain its last of­fer on fish­ing ac­cess and it was down now to Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son to de­cide whether he wants a deal.</p>
    <p>The United King­dom has sug­gested this com­pro­mise last for three years be­fore it is rene­go­ti­ated, whereas Europe is hold­ing out for seven.</p>
    <p>“It’s all down to num­bers now,” the sec­ond Euro­pean diplo­mat said.</p>
    <p>The EU’s point man in the talks, Mr Michel Barnier, has con­sulted mem­ber states that share fish­ing wa­ters with Bri­tain on the hag­gling over the is­sue, the diplo­mat added.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Par­lia­ment has high­lighted a dead­line of mid­night to­day (7am to­mor­row, Sin­ga­pore time) as the last mo­ment to re­ceive a deal for re­view if EU law­mak­ers are to rat­ify it be­fore the end of the year.</p>
    <p>Their Bri­tish par­lia­men­tary coun­ter­parts are in re­cess, but can be re­called within 48 hours to do like­wise.</p>
    <p>But EU cap­i­tals are not bind­ing them­selves to the Euro­pean Par­lia­ment’s dead­line.</p>
    <p>France’s Euro­pean Affairs Min­is­ter Cle­ment Beaune warned that time left to get a deal was “a mat­ter of hours”, echo­ing words used by Mr Barnier a day ear­lier.</p>
    <p>But, Mr Beaune told French ra­dio, talks will not be called to a halt even if they go past to­day.</p>
    <p>“We won’t do that be­cause what is at risk is whole sec­tors like fish­ing, like sus­tain­able com­pe­ti­tion con­di­tions for our busi­nesses.”</p>
    <p>The ur­gency of reach­ing a deal is be­ing driven home by scenes of long lines of lor­ries at the en­trance to the freight rail link that goes through the Chan­nel Tun­nel as Bri­tish com­pa­nies fran­ti­cally stock­pile goods.</p>
    <p>A group of Bri­tish MPs warned in a re­port re­leased yes­ter­day that Bri­tain has not yet in­stalled all the com­plex in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy sys­tems and port in­fras­truc­ture needed to en­sure post-Brexit trade with the EU runs smoothly.</p>
    <p>“With just seven work­ing days un­til the end of the tran­si­tion pe­riod, sig­nif­i­cant con­cerns re­main,” said Mr Hi­lary Benn, a prom­i­nent Labour MP who chairs the cross­party Com­mit­tee on the Fu­ture Re­la­tion­ship with the EU, which put out the re­port.</p>
    <p>Dis­rup­tion is in­evitable whether a deal hap­pens or not.</p>
    <p>Out­side the sin­gle mar­ket, Bri­tish and Euro­pean traders will have to fill out im­port-ex­port, health and tax forms to send and re­ceive goods.</p>
    <p>A deal would lighten that bur­den by re­mov­ing tar­iffs, but there would still be traf­fic snarls as checks on lorry loads and driv­ers’ pa­pers are car­ried out.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, lo­gis­tics com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing DB Schenker and DSV Panalpina, have be­gun char­ter­ing planes to keep Bri­tish fac­to­ries sup­plied with com­po­nents and avoid the ex­pected dis­rup­tion to road and sea trans­port.</p>
    <p>DB Schenker, owned by rail gi­ant Deutsche Bahn, told Bloomberg that a ma­jor Ger­man in­dus­trial cus­tomer has asked it to send parts to and from Bri­tish pro­duc­tion fa­cil­i­ties by air from Jan 1.</p>
    <p>DSV is separately work­ing to es­tab­lish a daily air shut­tle be­tween main­land Europe and Bri­tain from the start of next year to help cus­tomers main­tain de­liv­er­ies.</p>
    <p>The firms are among the world’s five largest freight for­warders.</p>
    <p>The ur­gency of reach­ing a deal is be­ing driven home by scenes of long lines of lor­ries at the en­trance to the freight rail link that goes through the Chan­nel Tun­nel as Bri­tish com­pa­nies fran­ti­cally stock­pile goods.</p>
