    <p>Q What has been your big­gest in­vest­ing mis­take?</p>
    <p>A When I started in­vest­ing in eq­ui­ties as a teenager in 1998, I re­alised that I could take lev­er­age and that would mag­nify my re­turns man­i­fold.</p>
    <p>How­ever, as we all know, lev­er­age is a dou­ble-edged sword. Af­ter mak­ing hand­some prof­its on my first few trades, I lost a con­sid­er­able chunk of money in the dot.com bust. I had to ask my fam­ily to help fund those losses.</p>
    <p>That was when I took my worst loss from in­vest­ments, about $10,000 – a con­sid­er­able sum of money for me at that point in time as I was around 20 years old and liv­ing in In­dia.</p>
    <p>Since then, I have not traded and in­vest only for the long term.</p>
    <p>Q And your best in­vest­ment?</p>
    <p>A Tech­nol­ogy has al­ways fas­ci­nated me – I was amazed when I first saw a mo­bile phone and con­sid­ered the power of the de­vice. A few years ago, I started to con­sider how out­sized re­turns could be made by in­vest­ing in com­pa­nies with cut­ting-edge tech­nol­ogy that can chal­lenge the sta­tus quo.</p>
    <p>Over the past few years, I have bought sev­eral tech­nol­ogy stocks, some of which have quadru­pled or quin­tu­pled in value.</p>
    <p>Aside from FAANG stocks (Face­book, Ap­ple, Ama­zon, Net­flix and Google par­ent Al­pha­bet), one of my best in­vest­ments was in Twilio, a United States-based cloud com­mu­ni­ca­tions plat­form.</p>
    <p>I bought shares at around US$27 in 2017 and sold them at US$90 in 2018, which at the time seemed like a fan­tas­tic re­turn.</p>
    <p>In hind­sight, I wish I had not sold when I did, as the shares are cur­rently trad­ing at around US$250, which again re­it­er­ates the power of long-term in­vest­ing.</p>
