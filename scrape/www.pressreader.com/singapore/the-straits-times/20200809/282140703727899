    <p>Ideally, your work­out should be quick, fuss-free and well-rounded. In re­al­ity, how­ever, most of us play favourites, choos­ing to do only what we en­joy.</p>
    <p>But when you do the same thing day in and out, you’re likely to ne­glect cer­tain mus­cle groups.</p>
    <p>That’s why we asked var­i­ous fit­ness in­struc­tors for these non-ne­go­tiable ex­er­cises that every woman should do.</p>
    <p>RUS­SIAN TWIST</p>
    <p>Works obliques and abs.</p>
    <p>Why do it: This tough­ens up the up­per body, and will help in ac­tiv­i­ties that re­quire torso ro­ta­tion, such as swim­ming, ten­nis and golf.</p>
    <p>How of­ten: Three to five times a week.</p>
    <p>Sit on mat with knees bent at about 90 de­grees. Lean back slightly and clasp hands in front of chest. Con­tract ab­dom­i­nal mus­cles. As you ex­hale, twist torso to left, keep­ing back straight. In­hale, re­turn to cen­tre and re­peat other side to com­plete rep. Do three sets of 20 reps.</p>
    <p>SQUAT</p>
    <p>Works quads, ham­strings, in­ner and outer thighs, glutes and core. Why do it: This ex­er­cise re­cruits many mus­cles at once, and is in­cred­i­bly func­tional. It mim­ics ba­sic move­ments like stand­ing up, lift­ing some­thing heavy off the ground and climb­ing the stairs. For any­one look­ing to build a perky butt, squats are one of your best bets.</p>
    <p>How of­ten: Three or four times a week, with a rest day in be­tween. Stand with feet slightly wider than hips, turned slightly out­wards. Pull shoul­der blades down and back. Keep chest lifted and chin par­al­lel to ground. Tighten core and ab­dom­i­nal mus­cles, then shift weight to heels. Push hips back as if you’re about to sit on a chair, and lower your­self un­til thighs are par­al­lel or al­most par­al­lel to ground.</p>
    <p>Feet should be firm on ground and knees aligned with sec­ond toe, with­out go­ing past toes. Ex­tend fore­arms in front of you to sta­bilise. Avoid tuck­ing tail­bone or arch­ing lower back. Re­turn to start­ing po­si­tion by push­ing through heels. Do three to five sets of 10 to 15 reps.</p>
    <p>DUMB-BELL PULLOVER</p>
    <p>Works chest, back, rear del­toids, tri­ceps and abs.</p>
    <p>Why do it: Score a stronger up­per body for bet­ter bal­ance and pos­ture. This move also ben­e­fits women at risk of de­vel­op­ing mus­cu­lar im­bal­ance, es­pe­cially those who tend to carry a child on one side of their hips.</p>
    <p>How of­ten: Thrice a week, with a rest day in be­tween.</p>
    <p>Lie face up on mat, knees bent and shoul­der-width apart. Hold a medicine ball weigh­ing at least 2kg above chest, arms ex­tended with el­bows slightly bent. In­hale and slowly lower ball to back un­til arms are in line with torso. Ex­hale and slowly re­turn to the ini­tial po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Do three sets of 15 reps, rest­ing 20 sec­onds be­tween each set. If us­ing a dumb-bell, hold it hor­i­zon­tally and grip both ends firmly. In­crease weight of medicine ball or dumb­bell as you get stronger.</p>
    <p>PLANK</p>
    <p>Works abs, obliques and lower back.</p>
    <p>Why do it: It’s a pow­er­ful ex­er­cise to sculpt and strengthen the core mus­cles, such as the obliques, abs and lower back. A strong core en­ables you to per­form ex­er­cises and daily move­ments (even sit­ting down!) with good pos­ture.</p>
    <p>How of­ten: Twice or thrice a week. In face-down po­si­tion, bal­ance on knees and el­bows with hands balled and wrists fac­ing in­wards. Lift body off ground, en­gag­ing mus­cles in back, abs, arms and legs to form a line from head to heel.</p>
    <p>Make sure back is not arched and hips do not sag. Keep eyes on hands with­out low­er­ing head or tuck­ing in chin. Hold for 10 to 15 sec­onds and re­peat three times, rest­ing up to 60 sec­onds in be­tween. In­crease hold­ing time as you get stronger.</p>
    <p>BIKRAM HALF MOON</p>
    <p>Works abs, butt, hips, thighs, del­toids, trapez­ius and chest.</p>
    <p>Why do it: Strike this pose for a more flex­i­ble spine, and to al­le­vi­ate back pain, stiff shoul­ders and torso as well as sco­l­io­sis. It makes you ac­ti­vate the abs, butt and thighs.</p>
    <p>How of­ten: Every day.</p>
    <p>Raise arms over­head and in­ter­lock fin­gers. Re­lease in­dex fin­gers, keep­ing thumbs crossed. In­hale, then slowly bend body to right and push hips to left un­til you feel a deep stretch down left side. Keep spine neu­tral and arms close to ears. Hold for one minute and switch sides. Re­peat set once more.</p>
    <p>DOWN­WARD FAC­ING DOG</p>
    <p>Works del­toids, tri­ceps, spine, ham­strings, glutes and calves.</p>
    <p>Why do it: This com­mon yoga pose strength­ens your up­per body while giv­ing the spine, ham­strings, glutes and calves a good stretch. Be­ing in the in­verted pose boosts blood cir­cu­la­tion too.</p>
    <p>How of­ten: Every day; if not, at least thrice a week. Get on all fours with feet and knees hip-width apart. Place hands shoul­der-width apart and spread fin­gers wide.</p>
    <p>Press­ing firmly through hands, lift knees off mat and straighten legs. Walk hands for­ward and feet back­wards to ad­just po­si­tion. (If you have tight ham­strings, bend knees gently.)</p>
    <p>Squeeze thighs and imag­ine press­ing them against a flat plane. Press heels down onto mat as much as pos­si­ble. Keep neck re­laxed and breathe deeply. Hold for at least 60 sec­onds.</p>
    <p>PUSH-UP</p>
    <p>Works chest, tri­ceps, shoul­ders, up­per back and abs.</p>
    <p>Why do it: The push-up tar­gets the chest, tri­ceps, shoul­ders and up­per back. It ac­ti­vates the core and im­proves torso sta­bil­ity too, re­duc­ing your risk of lower back in­juries. How of­ten: Twice or thrice a week, with at least one rest day in be­tween.</p>
    <p>Get into plank po­si­tion with arms un­der shoul­ders and slightly wider than shoul­der-width apart. Body should be aligned from shoul­ders to an­kles. Shift weight to balls of feet. In­hale and lower body un­til it al­most touches mat.</p>
    <p>Keep pelvis neu­tral, el­bows close to body, and head in line with back. Ex­hale, straighten arms and re­turn to the ini­tial po­si­tion. Do as many reps as you can in proper form. In­crease the num­ber as you get stronger.</p>
    <p>RE­VERSE PLANK</p>
    <p>Works glutes, ham­strings, abs and back.</p>
    <p>Why do it: This move iso­lates and strength­ens the glutes and ham­strings, so it’s par­tic­u­larly use­ful for run­ners. Done cor­rectly, it en­gages both the abs and back to im­prove pos­ture. As a weight-bear­ing ex­er­cise, it also helps to build bone den­sity, which is im­por­tant to fight os­teo­poro­sis.</p>
    <p>How of­ten: Thrice a week.</p>
    <p>Sit on mat with legs ex­tended be­fore you. Place palms on floor slightly be­hind and out­side hips, fin­gers spread wide. Press­ing into palms, lift hips and torso to­wards ceil­ing, un­til body is aligned from head to heels. Look up slightly and point toes. Keep arms and legs straight. Hold for 30 sec­onds and re­peat three times, rest­ing up to 60 sec­onds in be­tween.</p>
