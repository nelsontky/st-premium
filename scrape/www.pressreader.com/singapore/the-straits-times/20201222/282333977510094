    <p>Al­ter­na­tive pro­tein com­pany Per­fect Day, which pro­duces an­i­mal­free dairy pro­teins, is link­ing up with the Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search (A*Star) to set up a re­search and de­vel­op­ment (R&D) lab­o­ra­tory here, bol­ster­ing Sin­ga­pore’s am­bi­tions in the grow­ing agri-food tech sec­tor.</p>
    <p>The lab, which will open in April next year, will sup­port the Cal­i­for­nia-head­quar­tered firm’s global R&D ac­tiv­i­ties. It will help en­sure the ac­cu­racy, speci­ficity and con­sis­tency of the firm’s pro­cesses and prod­ucts, which can be used to make milk, cheese and ice cream.</p>
    <p>At the same time, Per­fect Day will hire and train a pool of re­searchers, sci­en­tists and en­gi­neers for mi­croflora pro­tein in­no­va­tion in Sin­ga­pore, help­ing to de­velop lo­cal R&D tal­ent and ex­pos­ing them to high-value op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>It an­tic­i­pates that its work­force in Sin­ga­pore will be about 10 per cent of its head­count in the near term, said Per­fect Day co-founder Peru­mal Gandhi. The firm cur­rently has about 200 em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>An­nounc­ing the lab yes­ter­day dur­ing a visit to A*Star, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing noted how the agri-food tech sec­tor is of grow­ing im­por­tance in Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy as the world looks for in­no­va­tive, cost-ef­fec­tive and sus­tain­able food so­lu­tions to feed its grow­ing pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The sec­tor re­mains a bright spot amid the pan­demic, which has dis­rupted and weak­ened food sup­ply chains glob­ally, he added.</p>
    <p>“Lever­ag­ing Sin­ga­pore’s unique farm-to-fork ecosys­tem and track record for tech­ni­cal ca­pa­bil­i­ties, qual­ity brand­ing and in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty pro­tec­tion, we aim to cap­ture a sig­nif­i­cant share of the eco­nomic op­por­tu­ni­ties in the agri­food tech sec­tor,” Mr Chan said.</p>
    <p>There are in­creas­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore to grow its sus­tain­able food in­dus­try here and in the re­gion, he added, not­ing how there has been ris­ing in­ter­est among global firms to an­chor new agri-food ca­pa­bil­i­ties here.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, Ger­man in­door ver­ti­cal farm­ing firm &ever is set­ting up a farm in Sin­ga­pore that will pro­duce 500 tonnes of veg­eta­bles a year, and also a global R&D cen­tre that will col­lab­o­rate with lo­cal part­ners to re­duce en­ergy con­sump­tion and op­ti­mise yield.</p>
    <p>The open­ing of the Agri-Food In­no­va­tion Park in the sec­ond quar­ter of next year will fur­ther catal­yse in­no­va­tion in the sec­tor, bring­ing to­gether high-tech farm­ing and as­so­ci­ated R&D ac­tiv­i­ties to dis­cover syn­er­gies along value chains, Mr Chan said.</p>
    <p>It will also serve as a base to at­tract com­pa­nies, R&D tal­ent and in­vest­ment to Sin­ga­pore, he added.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment is build­ing a vi­brant clus­ter of fi­nanc­ing firms across var­i­ous stages and agri-food ac­cel­er­a­tors, and aims to build up the tal­ent pool with ex­per­tise to de­ploy more than $90 mil­lion of cap­i­tal in agri-tech com­pa­nies, he said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore may not be able to scale up pro­duc­tion for all the food types here, but it looks to po­si­tion it­self to at­tract in­vest­ments and the high in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty com­po­nents of the global value chain.</p>
    <p>While the Re­pub­lic has am­bi­tions to have 30 per cent of its nu­tri­tional needs pro­duced lo­cally by 2030, it is also look­ing to cap­ture the grow­ing needs of the Asia-Pa­cific mar­ket with its agri-tech ca­pa­bil­i­ties, as the grow­ing mid­dle class in the re­gion seeks out higher-qual­ity food prod­ucts, he added.</p>
    <p>“Over­all, we are build­ing up the en­tire ecosys­tem to en­able Sin­ga­pore to be a bright spot in this re­gion for the new food in­dus­try that is much more sus­tain­able, much more af­ford­able and ac­ces­si­ble to the mar­kets in Asia and beyond,” Mr Chan said.</p>
