    <p>Af­ter a wet June and July, warmer and drier con­di­tions are ex­pected in the first half of this month, said the weath­er­man.</p>
    <p>The daily max­i­mum tem­per­a­ture is ex­pected to range be­tween 33 deg C and 34 deg C on most days, with highs of around 35 deg C on a few days.</p>
    <p>A few warm and hu­mid nights are also fore­cast, with tem­per­a­tures hov­er­ing at about 28 deg C.</p>
    <p>With the mon­soon rain band likely to shift north­ward, away from the equa­to­rial South-east Asia re­gion, rain­fall for the first fort­night of this month is fore­cast to be slightly below nor­mal over most parts of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>How­ever, wide­spread thun­dery show­ers with gusty winds are ex­pected in the early morn­ing on two to three days.</p>
    <p>Some days may also have short, mod­er­ate to heavy thun­dery show­ers over parts of the is­land be­tween the late morn­ing and af­ter­noon due to so­lar heat­ing of land ar­eas.</p>
    <p>As for July, more than two-thirds of the is­land re­ceived above av­er­age rain­fall dur­ing the month, as the mon­soon rain band re­mained over the equa­to­rial South-east Asia re­gion.</p>
    <p>The month’s low­est daily max­i­mum tem­per­a­ture of 25.9 deg C was recorded at Khatib on July 13, which was linked to the is­land­wide thun­dery show­ers and over­cast skies that day.</p>
    <p>The daily max­i­mum tem­per­a­tures at all sta­tions across the is­land in July were below 33 deg C for more than half the month. On nine of those days, the daily max­i­mum tem­per­a­ture was below 32 deg C.</p>
    <p>This June was also the wettest in the last decade, due to strong so­lar heat­ing of the land. Large-scale con­ver­gence of winds in the sur­round­ing re­gion and the pas­sage of Su­ma­tra squalls over Sin­ga­pore on some days also con­trib­uted to thun­dery show­ers.</p>
    <p>The squalls are or­gan­ised lines of thun­der­storms that orig­i­nate over Su­ma­tra or the Strait of Malacca, and typ­i­cally move east­ward to­wards Sin­ga­pore.</p>
