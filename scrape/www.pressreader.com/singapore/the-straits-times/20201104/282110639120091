    <p>I en­joy go­ing to Be­dok Town Park for leisure walks in the morn­ing or late af­ter­noon. And I love tak­ing photos of but­ter­flies, drag­on­flies and birds in the park.</p>
    <p>The place is spa­cious and tran­quil, and ideal for ex­er­cis­ing, re­lax­ing and de­stress­ing with na­ture.</p>
    <p>How­ever, of late, some of the go­ings-on in the park are an­noy­ing users like me who go there for some peace and quiet.</p>
    <p>First, there is the use of pow­ered leaf-blow­ers to col­lect fallen leaves. The ear-split­ting noise from the blow­ers goes on for hours for two or three days in a row, and the noise re­ver­ber­ates through much of the park.</p>
    <p>Even for just a few leaves, I no­tice the work­ers will use the blow­ers to move them to a heap of al­ready col­lected leaves me­tres away. The few leaves can eas­ily be picked up with a sharp stick or a thin iron rod.</p>
    <p>What has hap­pened to the rakes and brooms which can do the job equally well with­out the ugly noise.</p>
    <p>Then there is the catch­ing of but­ter­flies by chil­dren ac­com­pa­nied by adults. While I try to cap­ture these but­ter­flies with my cam­era, they try to catch them with nets. I think a sign should be put up telling vis­i­tors to leave the but­ter­flies alone.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren should be taught to ap­pre­ci­ate but­ter­flies in their nat­u­ral habi­tat. Catch­ing them means killing them.</p>
    <p>Third, there are peo­ple who are not en­gaged in any form of stren­u­ous ex­er­cise but are not wear­ing masks. They have be­come com­pla­cent and let their guard down. These self­ish peo­ple en­dan­ger the lives of other park users and must be stopped. Since the start of the cir­cuit breaker in April, I have not seen any en­force­ment of­fi­cer in the park.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, bi­cy­cles are parked il­le­gally on the cov­ered walk­way, right un­der the sign that says no bi­cy­cle park­ing just out­side the MRT sta­tion.</p>
    <p>There is a big des­ig­nated bi­cy­cle park a few me­tres away. It is usu­ally the same two or three bi­cy­cles parked on the cov­ered walk­way.</p>
