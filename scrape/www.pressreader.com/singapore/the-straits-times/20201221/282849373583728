    <p>DIN­NER AND JAM­MING:</p>
    <p>Man­dopop su­per­stars JJ Lin (above right) and Jay Chou (above, sec­ond from left) and Hong Kong ac­tor Shawn Yue (above, sec­ond from right) got a free din­ner cour­tesy of pow­er­house Tai­wanese singer Jam Hsiao (above left).</p>
    <p>The four men shared photos of their din­ner last Thurs­day at the high-end Ja­panese omakase restau­rant Watan­abe in Taipei, which is Hsiao’s lat­est busi­ness ven­ture.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore-born Lin posted photos of the dishes served at the din­ner and wrote: “Thanks, Boss Jam Hsiao, for treat­ing us. The food at your new restau­rant is de­li­cious.”</p>
    <p>They were part of a big­ger group to cel­e­brate the 44th birth­day of Chou’s close friend, Tai­wanese ma­gi­cian Chen Kuan-lin.</p>
    <p>Tai­wanese singer Chou tagged Chen in a video of the group singing him Happy Birth­day and wrote: “The birth­day boy must feel so happy that so many hand­some men are cel­e­brat­ing his birth­day for him.”</p>
    <p>Chen shared a group photo of the din­ner, which showed that Chou’s model-wife Han­nah Quin­li­van, Yue’s wife Sarah Wang and Sum­mer Lin – who is Hsiao’s long-time man­ager and ru­moured girl­friend – were also present.</p>
    <p>The party did not seem to end at the restau­rant as Hsiao also made a post later – a video of Chou and JJ Lin tak­ing turns to play the pi­ano. In the clip, Hsiao does a silly dance be­hind Lin and gives him a hug from the back.</p>
    <p>Hsiao wrote: “These were the two guys play­ing the pi­ano at 1am in the morn­ing.”</p>
