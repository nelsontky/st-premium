    <p>For years, she has been known as the founder of de­signer dress rental com­pany Covetella, but Carol Chen is fi­nally ful­fill­ing her life­long dream of start­ing her own fash­ion la­bel.</p>
    <p>Trained as a fash­ion de­signer, the 38-year-old had started cloth­ing brands in the past, but with niche con­cepts – such as a cloth­ing line for mixed-mar­tial arts fight­ers and cheer­lead­ing uni­forms. These have since closed or are now run by her busi­ness part­ners with­out her.</p>
    <p>She also did ca­sual wom­enswear, but har­boured an as­pi­ra­tion of de­sign­ing some­thing “very run­way and avant-garde” – dressy pieces in her per­sonal style, like those cu­rated for Covetella.</p>
    <p>But it was never the right time – un­til now. With no events to at­tend dur­ing the pandemic, her com­pany, which spe­cialises in dress­ing women in lux­ury gowns, is on a hia­tus.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Sto­ries gave her the push she needed.</p>
    <p>“As an en­trepreneur, I’ve al­ways cre­ated com­pa­nies to fill a need. ‘Carol Chen’ the brand was more of a want,” says the Amer­ica-born Chi­nese, who started Covetella in 2015 when she came to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Inspired by the cities she has trav­elled to – she has lived in nine in­clud­ing Lon­don and Hong Kong – she says: “Sin­ga­pore is by far my favourite city to live in.”</p>
    <p>It was the in­ter­twin­ing of mod­ern ar­chi­tec­ture, tech­nol­ogy and na­ture here that stole her heart.</p>
    <p>“It’s hard to see that in other cities. I love that jux­ta­po­si­tion.”</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, her de­signs for the com­pe­ti­tion will jux­ta­pose fab­rics – “tech-look­ing” laser-cut fab­rics that re­mind her of Ion Or­chard – with em­broi­dered fab­ric to rep­re­sent the na­ture here.</p>
    <p>“I’m not born or from here, so my Sin­ga­pore story is hon­estly what I see. I live in the CBD and my view over­looks Ma­rina Bay Sands,” she says.</p>
    <p>All her five looks are inspired by the city’s ar­chi­tec­ture, par­tic­u­larly Gar­dens by the Bay and Jewel Changi Air­port.</p>
    <p>Her first is a mod­ern ke­baya fea­tur­ing mesh de­tails inspired by the sky net play­ground at Jewel. Mod­u­lar pieces make up the out­fit, so peo­ple can mix and match with sep­a­rates they al­ready own.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 has made us re-think how we spend money,” says Chen. “Some­thing becomes an in­vest­ment piece when you can wear it many ways.”</p>
    <p>Hope­ful that peo­ple will once more dress up and go out post-pandemic, she is de­sign­ing Carol Chen “with the fu­ture world in mind”.</p>
    <p>“It’s not the most op­por­tune time to start a fash­ion la­bel now, but it’s still a re­ally good time to cre­ate and dream of a bet­ter fu­ture.”</p>
