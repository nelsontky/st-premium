    <p>•</p>
    <p>A third of US vot­ers listed the economy as the is­sue that mat­tered most to them when de­cid­ing their choice for pres­i­dent while two out of 10 cited Covid-19, ac­cord­ing to an Edi­son Re­search exit poll on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus has in­fected more than 9.4 mil­lion peo­ple in the United States this year and killed more than 230,000.</p>
    <p>In the na­tional exit poll, four out of 10 vot­ers said they think the ef­fort to con­tain the virus is go­ing “very badly”.</p>
    <p>In the bat­tle­ground states of Florida and North Carolina, five in 10 vot­ers said the na­tional re­sponse to the pan­demic is go­ing “some­what or very badly”.</p>
    <p>Half the US vot­ers said it was more im­por­tant to con­tain the coro­n­avirus even if it hurts the economy, ac­cord­ing to the poll, which is based on in-per­son in­ter­views with vot­ers on Tues­day, in­per­son in­ter­views at early vot­ing cen­tres be­fore Election Day and tele­phone in­ter­views with peo­ple who voted by mail.</p>
    <p>Six in 10 said the pan­demic had cre­ated at least a mod­er­ate fi­nan­cial hard­ship. And seven in 10 said wear­ing a face mask in public is a “public health re­spon­si­bil­ity” ver­sus three in 10 who see it as a per­sonal choice.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to an As­so­ci­ated</p>
    <p>Press (AP) can­vass of those who had cast bal­lots, nearly two-thirds of vot­ers said they be­lieved that the coun­try was head­ing in the wrong di­rec­tion, re­flect­ing a per­va­sive pes­simism – and those vot­ers over­whelm­ingly picked Demo­cratic can­di­date Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>And while in­cum­bent Don­ald Trump had at­tempted to fo­cus the cam­paign on any­thing other than the pan­demic, it re­mained a defin­ing is­sue: More than four in 10 vot­ers said it was the most im­por­tant prob­lem fac­ing the coun­try, far more than any other is­sue.</p>
    <p>The opin­ion of vot­ers fell along starkly par­ti­san lines, with those who viewed the pan­demic as the most press­ing is­sue favour­ing Mr Bi­den for pres­i­dent, while those who named the economy and jobs break­ing over­whelm­ingly to­wards re-elect­ing Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>The Edi­son poll found that nine out of 10 vot­ers had al­ready de­cided who to vote for be­fore last month, and nine out of 10 vot­ers said they were con­fi­dent that their state would ac­cu­rately count votes.</p>
    <p>One in 10 vot­ers said they were vot­ing for the first time, which was sim­i­lar to the 2016 election sur­vey.</p>
    <p>Other is­sues that were top of mind for vot­ers in­cluded racial in­equal­ity, crime and safety, and healthcare pol­icy.</p>
    <p>For the first time, not one but two prob­a­bil­ity-based, sci­en­tif­i­cally sound voter sur­veys were con­ducted amid the election.</p>
    <p>The Edi­son exit poll, con­ducted on be­half of the Na­tional Election Pool me­dia con­sor­tium, was car­ried out by phone with vot­ers who had cast bal­lots early, and by in­per­son in­ter­views at vot­ing places.</p>
    <p>The AP also con­ducted its own voter sur­vey, called VoteCast, us­ing a panel of on­line re­spon­dents as­sem­bled by NORC, a re­search group based at the Univer­sity of Chicago.</p>
    <p>The over­all trends in the re­sults were con­sis­tent be­tween the two or­gan­i­sa­tions’ sur­veys, although the exit poll ap­peared to show Mr Trump run­ning strongly in more states than the VoteCast sur­vey did.</p>
