    <p>Just three Covid-19 com­mu­nity care fa­cil­i­ties con­tinue to op­er­ate and there were only 36 pa­tients in all as of yes­ter­day, down from as many as more than 17,000 in May.</p>
    <p>In line with the fall­ing num­bers, some of the coun­try’s big­gest fa­cil­i­ties that iso­lated and treated thou­sands of pa­tients just months ago are down­siz­ing and go­ing back to their orig­i­nal pur­pose.</p>
    <p>Such fa­cil­i­ties house peo­ple who tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 but have mild symp­toms and lower risk fac­tors.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Min­istry of Health told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that as of last Wed­nes­day, the only fa­cil­i­ties op­er­at­ing are at D’Re­sort NTUC, Sin­ga­pore Expo and Big Box.</p>
    <p>Fa­cil­i­ties that have been taken off the list in­clude those at Changi Ex­hi­bi­tion Cen­tre (CEC), Prince Ge­orge’s Park Res­i­dences at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, and some of the halls at Sin­ga­pore Expo.</p>
    <p>“A few sites have re­turned to their orig­i­nal use while oth­ers have been re­pur­posed as tem­po­rary ac­com­mo­da­tion sites for re­cov­ered work­ers,” said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>The spokesman added that each fa­cil­ity was de­signed and built to fa­cil­i­tate rapid scal­ing up and down, de­pend­ing on the num­ber of cases of Covid-19 here.</p>
    <p>“Should the need arise, MOH can re­ac­ti­vate the var­i­ous re­serve fa­cil­i­ties to meet a surge in de­mand, as well as to swiftly de­ploy the nec­es­sary med­i­cal ser­vice and an­cil­lary man­power needed to sup­port the op­er­a­tions,” said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, ST vis­ited the CEC and saw most of the fa­cil­ity was empty and fenced up with large can­vas sheets. Mem­bers of the pub­lic were not al­lowed to en­ter, and around 10 con­struc­tion work­ers could be seen at work, with some op­er­at­ing machin­ery like fork­lifts.</p>
    <p>ST un­der­stands that work is un­der way to open up the Sin­ga­pore Expo for con­ven­tions. In April, it was con­verted into a care fa­cil­ity with 8,000 beds.</p>
    <p>To­mor­row, the venue will see the start of a three-day In­dus­trial Trans­for­ma­tion Asia Pa­cific 2020 ex­hi­bi­tion, where speak­ers and guests will par­tic­i­pate in dis­cus­sions in per­son and vir­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Expo said since it was re­pur­posed as a care fa­cil­ity, it had im­ple­mented safe man­age­ment mea­sures, in­clud­ing strin­gent san­i­ta­tion and hy­giene stan­dards.</p>
    <p>It is also invit­ing venue and event in­quiries for its con­ven­tion wing, which will re­open for events with up to 250 at­ten­dees.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore re­ported seven new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, tak­ing the coun­try’s to­tal to 57,911.</p>
    <p>As of yes­ter­day, 40 cases re­main hos­pi­talised.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, the virus out­break, which be­gan in De­cem­ber last year, has in­fected more than 39.6 mil­lion peo­ple. More than 1.11 mil­lion peo­ple have died.</p>
