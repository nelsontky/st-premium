    <p>Short-term vis­i­tors can­not use pub­lic trans­port</p>
    <p>7-day stay-home no­tice for those stay­ing longer</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­ca­tions for cross-bor­der travel be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia for long-term pass hold­ers and trav­ellers on es­sen­tial busi­ness and of­fi­cial vis­its will start on Aug 10.</p>
    <p>But those trav­el­ling un­der the two schemes meant for short- and long-term vis­its would have to abide by strict pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures before, dur­ing and after their vis­its.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, work pass hold­ers en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore un­der the scheme that re­quires them to stay here for longer pe­ri­ods of at least 90 days will be re­quired to take a Covid-19 swab test and serve a stay­home no­tice (SHN) of at least seven days.</p>
    <p>This is shorter than the usual 14-day SHN pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Shorter-term vis­i­tors who plan to stay in the des­ti­na­tion country for up to 14 days must also ad­here to a con­trolled itin­er­ary for the du­ra­tion of their stay.</p>
    <p>They will also not be al­lowed to use pub­lic trans­port in Sin­ga­pore or Malaysia for the du­ra­tion of their stay, ex­cept for pri­vate-hire cars, taxis or com­pany trans­port.</p>
    <p>All trav­ellers must also ob­tain ap­proval for the trip from the au­thor­i­ties of the des­ti­na­tion country through ap­pli­ca­tions made by em­ploy­ers, com­pa­nies or gov­ern­ment agen­cies.</p>
    <p>All vis­i­tors must also be tested for Covid-19 upon ar­rival.</p>
    <p>De­tails on the re­quire­ments, health pro­to­cols and ap­pli­ca­tion pro­cesses in­volved for en­try and exit into Malaysia and Sin­ga­pore were posted on the web­site of the Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Au­thor­ity yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>They fol­low an ear­lier agree­ment be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia on July 14 to start dis­cus­sions on how cross-bor­der travel can be fa­cil­i­tated for long-term pass hold­ers as well as es­sen­tial busi­ness and of­fi­cial trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>The re­sump­tion of cross-bor­der travel be­tween the two coun­tries will take place un­der two schemes: the re­cip­ro­cal green lane for trav­ellers on shorter vis­its, and the longer-term pe­ri­odic com­mut­ing ar­range­ment.</p>
    <p>These schemes are not avail­able to stu­dents or tourists.</p>
    <p>The pe­ri­odic com­mut­ing ar­range­ment scheme al­lows for longert­erm work and busi­ness-re­lated travel, with vis­i­tors hav­ing to re­main in the des­ti­na­tion country for at least 90 days before re­turn­ing for home leave.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers un­der this scheme can only do so via the two land bor­der cross­ings at Wood­lands and Tuas check­points.</p>
    <p>Those en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore are re­quired to serve an SHN of at least seven days and take a Covid-19 poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) swab test.</p>
    <p>The em­ployee can com­mence work only after serv­ing the SHN and test­ing neg­a­tive for the coron­avirus in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>If tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, he will be treated here.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens and per­ma­nent res­i­dents re­turn­ing to Sin­ga­pore for home leave after work­ing for at least 90 days in Malaysia un­der the pe­ri­odic com­mut­ing ar­range­ment can ap­ply for a waiver of SHN.</p>
    <p>The other scheme, the re­cip­ro­cal green lane, al­lows short-term travel for es­sen­tial busi­ness or of­fi­cial pur­poses be­tween the two coun­tries for up to 14 days.</p>
    <p>Such trav­ellers can travel only via air­ports that have avail­able non­stop flight routes be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia, or via the land check­points.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers must also take other mea­sures prior to their ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore or Malaysia.</p>
    <p>These in­clude tak­ing a pre-de­par­ture Covid-19 PCR test at ac­cred­ited lab­o­ra­to­ries within 72 hours before de­par­ture and ob­tain­ing a cer­tifi­cate of hav­ing tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>This cer­tifi­cate must be pre­sented in the country of ar­rival.</p>
    <p>Another swab test will be done on the trav­eller upon his ar­rival.</p>
    <p>After the swab test, trav­ellers must re­main in iso­la­tion un­til neg­a­tive test re­sults are re­leased.</p>
    <p>Those who test pos­i­tive for Covid-19 will un­dergo treat­ment at their own cost.</p>
    <p>Those vis­it­ing Malaysia or Sin­ga­pore un­der this scheme must also ad­here to a con­trolled itin­er­ary for</p>
    <p>the du­ra­tion of their stay, and would not be al­lowed to use pub­lic trans­port, ex­cept for pri­vate-hire cars, taxis or com­pany trans­port.</p>
    <p>They must also down­load and use con­tact-trac­ing ap­pli­ca­tions, TraceTo­gether i n Sin­ga­pore and the MySe­jahtera app in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>More i n f o r ma t i o n on the schemes is avail­able at https:// safetravel.ica.gov.sg</p>
