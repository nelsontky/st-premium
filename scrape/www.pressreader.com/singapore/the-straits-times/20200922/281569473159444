    <p>A speed­ing mo­torist who ploughed into pedes­tri­ans near the Ma­rina Bay Fi­nan­cial Cen­tre, af­ter he lost con­trol of his car af­ter over­tak­ing an­other ve­hi­cle, was jailed for 15 weeks. Lim Wei Sheng, 27, drove at speeds of up to 102kmh for about two sec­onds be­fore the crash, which left three pedes­tri­ans and his rear pas­sen­ger in­jured.</p>
    <p>A speed­ing mo­torist who ploughed into pedes­tri­ans near the Ma­rina Bay Fi­nan­cial Cen­tre (MBFC), when he lost con­trol of his car af­ter over­tak­ing an­other ve­hi­cle, was jailed for 15 weeks yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Lim Wei Sheng, 27, drove at speeds of up to 102kmh – twice the le­gal limit – for about two sec­onds be­fore the crash that left three pedes­tri­ans and his rear pas­sen­ger in­jured.</p>
    <p>Two of the pedes­tri­ans were se­ri­ously hurt in the in­ci­dent in April last year. Ms Yang Jing, 40, suf­fered shin­bone frac­tures and loss of leg mus­cles while Ms Song Jiao­jiao, 37, sus­tained mul­ti­ple frac­tures and torn knee lig­a­ments.</p>
    <p>Ms Song now at­tends psy­cho­log­i­cal coun­selling for post-trau­matic stress dis­or­der and is sched­uled to un­dergo fur­ther surgery to re­con­struct her right knee lig­a­ments and menis­cus next month. Her right knee move­ment re­mained lim­ited as of Aug 19.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the jail term, Lim was also dis­qual­i­fied from driv­ing all classes of ve­hi­cles for four years.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean pleaded guilty to two counts of caus­ing griev­ous hurt by driv­ing in a rash man­ner and ad­mit­ted to one count of caus­ing hurt to the third pedes­trian by rash driv­ing.</p>
    <p>A fourth charge in­volv­ing his pas­sen­ger was con­sid­ered dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Tan Zhi Hao said Lim was driv­ing along the sec­ond lane of the five-lane Cen­tral Boule­vard to­wards Cross Street be­hind a sil­ver car shortly be­fore the ac­ci­dent at around 6pm on April 15 last year.</p>
    <p>He then switched to the first lane, which is a right-turn-only lane, ac­cel­er­ated and over­took the sil­ver car.</p>
    <p>Lim was about to switch back to the sec­ond lane when a blue car in that lane tried to make a right turn into Ma­rina Way to­wards Ma­rina Boule­vard.</p>
    <p>The court heard that the blue car was in the sec­ond lane which al­lowed ve­hi­cles to ei­ther go straight or turn right.</p>
    <p>Lim tried to avoid hit­ting it by sw­erv­ing to the right but he lost con­trol. His car ploughed into pedes­tri­ans waiting to cross the road at a traf­fic light near MBFC Tower 3.</p>
    <p>His car ran over Ms Yang’s left leg while Ms Song was trapped un­der the front bumper.</p>
    <p>A third pedes­trian, Ms Ade­lene Ho, 35, suf­fered in­juries, in­clud­ing wounds to her left leg and mul­ti­ple bruises.</p>
    <p>All three women were rushed to the Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>Lim is out on bail of $10,000 to set­tle some per­sonal mat­ters. He will sur­ren­der him­self at the State Courts on Oct 12 to be­gin serv­ing his jail term.</p>
