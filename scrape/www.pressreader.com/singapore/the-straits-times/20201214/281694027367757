    <p>WASH­ING­TON When the coro­n­avirus stealth­ily in­fected 99 peo­ple af­ter phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firm Bio­gen held a two-day con­fer­ence in Fe­bru­ary, it added the term “su­per­spreader” to the pan­demic lex­i­con.</p>
    <p>Lit­tle did any­one know how su­per the spread would be­come.</p>
    <p>A new anal­y­sis of the Bio­gen event at a Bos­ton ho­tel has con­cluded that the coro­n­avirus strains let loose at the meet­ing have since mi­grated world­wide, in­fect­ing about 245,000 Amer­i­cans – and po­ten­tially as many as 300,000 – by the end of Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>The virus strains spread to at least 29 states. They were found in Aus­tralia, Swe­den and Slo­vakia.</p>
    <p>They wended their way from a room of biotech­nol­ogy ex­ec­u­tives to Bos­ton home­less shel­ters.</p>
    <p>Those are just the in­fec­tions. How many peo­ple were killed by the virus strains can­not be re­li­ably es­ti­mated. Nor do the fig­ures in­clude in­fec­tions among the six mil­lion Amer­i­cans who have tested pos­i­tive since Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>“When we hear these sto­ries of clus­ters where 20 or 50 or 100 were af­fected, that does not ac­count for what hap­pens af­ter,” said ge­nomic epi­demi­ol­o­gist Bron­wyn MacIn­nis at the Broad In­sti­tute of MIT and Har­vard.</p>
    <p>The anal­y­sis, by more than 50 health­care ex­perts and re­searchers based pri­mar­ily in the Bos­ton area, was pub­lished last Thurs­day in Sci­ence, the jour­nal of the Amer­i­can As­so­ci­a­tion for the Ad­vance­ment of Sci­ence.</p>
    <p>It is based on ge­netic analy­ses of the coro­n­avirus taken from 28 peo­ple who at­tended the Bio­gen an­nual lead­er­ship con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>At the time, only 30 Covid-19 in­fec­tions had been con­firmed in the United States. Bio­gen brought in 175 ex­ec­u­tives, in­clud­ing of­fi­cials from Italy, Switzer­land and Ger­many, for the meet­ing.</p>
    <p>The anal­y­sis of the 28 cases de­ter­mined that each per­son had been in­fected with a strain of the coro­n­avirus, named C2416T, that had not pre­vi­ously been seen in the US.</p>
    <p>The only known in­stances of the strain that pre­ceded the Bio­gen con­fer­ence in­volved two French pa­tients, aged 87 and 88.</p>
    <p>“We think there was a sin­gle im­por­ta­tion into Bos­ton, and that sin­gle im­por­ta­tion was tightly linked to the spread that oc­curred at the con­fer­ence,” Dr Ja­cob E. Lemieux, an in­fec­tious dis­ease spe­cial­ist at Mas­sachusetts Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal and a re­searcher at the Broad In­sti­tute, said.</p>
    <p>By May, it was es­ti­mated that up to 56,000 known Covid-19 cases were di­rectly tied to the Bio­gen con­fer­ence. About 40 per cent were in Bos­ton, but the C2416T strain was also car­ried across the coun­try and else­where.</p>
    <p>Fresh data in­cluded in the cur­rent anal­y­sis raised the es­ti­mate to as high as 300,000 cases in 29 states. The re­searchers es­ti­mated that the Cam­bridge strain of the virus was re­spon­si­ble for 1.9 per cent of all known cases in the US to Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>One of the study’s more ar­rest­ing find­ings was that within a month of the Bio­gen con­fer­ence, the virus strains had made their way to Bos­ton-area home­less shel­ters.</p>
    <p>Tests at the shel­ters found 14 strains of the coro­n­avirus, four of which ap­peared to have be­come su­per­spread­ers.</p>
    <p>Dr Lemieux said this of­fers a les­son for those who take a ca­sual at­ti­tude to­wards the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>“We are so con­nected that we don’t ap­pre­ci­ate the link­ages and in­ter­ac­tions we have,” he said.</p>
    <p>In the months since the Bio­gen out­break, the firm has come un­der fire for stag­ing a global con­fer­ence at a time when the like­li­hood of a pan­demic was be­com­ing clearer.</p>
    <p>“The irony is that a large drug com­pany was re­spon­si­ble for trig­ger­ing the mother of all su­per­spreader events that played a ma­jor role in mak­ing the virus en­demic in the US, killing more than 3,000 Amer­i­cans a day,” said Mr John Car­roll, edi­tor of End­points News, which cov­ers the biotech in­dus­try. “Top Bio­gen ex­ecs ac­ci­den­tally trig­gered a mas­sive health­care train wreck.”</p>
