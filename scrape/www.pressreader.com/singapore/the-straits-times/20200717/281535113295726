    <p>The lay­offs at Re­sorts World Sen­tosa (RWS) are a sign of things to come for Sin­ga­pore’s tourism sec­tor, in­dus­try ob­servers warn. While mass re­trench­ments had up till now largely been pre­vented, job losses and busi­ness clo­sures are likely to rise over the next two months, as wage sub­si­dies end and firms grap­ple with the con­tin­u­ing tourist drought, they say.</p>
    <p>The lay­offs at Re­sorts World Sen­tosa (RWS) are a sign of things to come for Sin­ga­pore’s tourism sec­tor, in­dus­try ob­servers warn.</p>
    <p>While mass re­trench­ments had up till now largely been pre­vented, job losses and busi­ness clo­sures are likely to rise over the next two months, as wage sub­si­dies end and firms grap­ple with the con­tin­u­ing tourist drought, they say.</p>
    <p>As at­trac­tions, ho­tels and tour op­er­a­tors be­gin to re­open, they are turn­ing to the lo­cal mar­ket and the pent-up de­mand from be­ing cooped up at home dur­ing Sin­ga­pore’s two-month cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>But the lo­cal mar­ket is too small to sus­tain the tourism in­dus­try, and with no end in sight to Sin­ga­pore’s re­stric­tions on mass travel, things are look­ing bleak.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tor ar­rivals in April and May hov­ered at record lows of about 800, af­ter Sin­ga­pore took the un­prece­dented step of clos­ing its bor­ders to tourists in March.</p>
    <p>Dr Kevin Cheong, chair­man of the As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore At­trac­tions (ASA), said many tourism es­tab­lish­ments, in­clud­ing his own Sen­tosa 4D Ad­ven­tureLand busi­ness, have been able to sur­vive and re­tain most of their lo­cal staff, thanks to wage sub­si­dies that will end next month.</p>
    <p>“The worst will come when the money runs out and those who re­opened have to face op­er­at­ing costs with lit­tle busi­ness,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Cheong noted that con­sumer sen­ti­ment has wors­ened sig­nif­i­cantly since be­fore the cir­cuit breaker, with mount­ing job losses and a re­ces­sion likely to tighten purse strings.</p>
    <p>And while lo­cals may be ex­pect­ing dis­counts galore, ca­pac­ity lim­its at at­trac­tions make this a dif­fi­cult propo­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Said Dr Cheong: “The eco­nom­ics of dis­count­ing is I bring the price down for vol­ume. But with a limit on ca­pac­ity, how do I do that?”</p>
    <p>Of the at­trac­tions that have been ap­proved to re­open, such as the Sin­ga­pore Zoo, most have been re­stricted to no more than 25 per cent of their op­er­at­ing ca­pac­ity at any one time to en­sure safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Such lim­its may not be sus­tain­able for long. Ac­cord­ing to an ASA sur­vey of 21 at­trac­tions, 45 per cent said they would wind up if their rev­enue from ad­mis­sions re­mained at half of pre-Covid-19 lev­els for four months or longer.</p>
    <p>RWS be­came the first ma­jor player to an­nounce mass lay­offs on Wed­nes­day. While it did not con­firm how many of its 7,000 em­ploy­ees were re­trenched, ST un­der­stands the num­ber to be about 2,000. The shares of Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore, which owns RWS, fell by 2.55 per cent yes­ter­day, mak­ing it the worst-per­form­ing com­po­nent stock on the Straits Times In­dex for the day.</p>
    <p>Last year, Sin­ga­pore’s tourism in­dus­try em­ployed about 65,000 work­ers across ar­eas such as ho­tels, busi­ness events and at­trac­tions.</p>
    <p>The tourism in­dus­try, which has been paral­ysed for half a year, is pin­ning its hopes on the green lane ar­range­ments Sin­ga­pore is mak­ing with coun­tries such as China and Malaysia. While they cur­rently fa­cil­i­tate only es­sen­tial busi­ness and of­fi­cial travel, the hope is that small group travel will even­tu­ally be a pos­si­bil­ity as well.</p>
    <p>Some coun­tries have be­gun to re­open their bor­ders to tourists, al­though the threat of a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions has prompted a few to reim­pose re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Ngee Ann Polytech­nic se­nior tourism lec­turer Michael Chiam said that with re­cent spikes in places such as Hong Kong, South Korea and Aus­tralia, the eas­ing of travel re­stric­tions for leisure trav­ellers to Sin­ga­pore may not be likely un­til the end of this year or early next year.</p>
    <p>Safe dis­tanc­ing and travel re­stric­tions are likely to re­main the norm un­til a vac­cine for the coro­n­avirus is cre­ated and made widely avail­able.</p>
    <p>For tourism busi­nesses, this means scal­ing down op­er­a­tions and re-en­gi­neer­ing their of­fer­ings, or throw­ing in the towel.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong Soon-Hwa, chair­man of the Pa­cific Asia Travel As­so­ci­a­tion’s Sin­ga­pore Chap­ter, said it will likely take three to five years for the air­line in­dus­try to re­build ca­pac­ity and de­mand.</p>
    <p>Con­fi­dence is high among in­dus­try play­ers that Sin­ga­pore’s tourism sec­tor will see a strong re­bound when the cri­sis is over, but the chal­lenge for busi­nesses is to find a way to sur­vive un­til then.</p>
    <p>Big­ger play­ers with deeper pock­ets are likely to sur­vive bet­ter, said Mr Wong. “We are in the same storm, but we are not in the same boat. Some are sam­pans, some are yachts, some are big cruise ships. All try­ing to stay afloat.”</p>
