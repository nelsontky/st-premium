    <p>Sen­si­tive doc­u­ments from the Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN) and a host of stolen mil­i­tary-re­lated in­for­ma­tion from other coun­tries ended up on a Dark Web por­tal last month.</p>
    <p>Other leaked doc­u­ments sup­pos­edly be­longed to the Nige­rian Navy, United States Army and Air Force, as well as var­i­ous de­fence con­trac­tors.</p>
    <p>In April, the Armed Forces of the Philip­pines also con­firmed the ex­is­tence of a leaked in­ter­nal memo on troop de­ploy­ment to help en­force a lock­down amid the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>While such data breaches may seem shock­ing, leaked mil­i­tary doc­u­ments are not un­com­mon, se­cu­rity and in­tel­li­gence ex­perts told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Mr Mikko Niemela, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Cy­ber In­tel­li­gence House, said mil­i­tary and in­tel­li­gence doc­u­ments are like any other con­fi­den­tial doc­u­ment from a value per­spec­tive.</p>
    <p>“The rea­son why they are of­ten seen in ‘spe­cialised’ mar­kets or fo­rums (on the Dark Web) is be­cause it makes it eas­ier for the po­ten­tial clien­tele to ac­cess that in­for­ma­tion,” Mr Niemela said.</p>
    <p>Un­like the “sur­face Web” of web­sites and in­for­ma­tion that can be found via search en­gines like Google, a Dark Web por­tal can be ac­cessed only via a spe­cial browser and spe­cific URL ad­dress.</p>
    <p>Pay­ment for the doc­u­ments is usu­ally made in bit­coin as such trans­ac­tions of­fer anonymity to both seller and buyer.</p>
    <p>In the RMN’s case, about 70 doc­u­ments were up­loaded onto the web­site. It is not known if who­ever was re­spon­si­ble for this in­tended to sell or share the in­for­ma­tion. But ST un­der­stands that the i nfor­ma­tion gath­ered was from a few sources who had hacked into e-mail ac­counts of mil­i­tary per­son­nel.</p>
    <p>Among them were doc­u­ments per­tain­ing to troop strength at sev­eral Malaysian navy and army bases dur­ing a hol­i­day last year; se­nior and ju­nior navy of­fi­cers charged with cor­rup­tion, drug con­sump­tion and be­ing ab­sent without leave; and naval exam re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>There was also a US diplo­matic let­ter dated July last year re­quest­ing that a US Navy ship be berthed at a Sabah port last Au­gust. It pro­vided de­tails on the ship’s radar equip­ment and fre­quen­cies used.</p>
    <p>The same web­site also pro­vided links to con­fi­den­tial files from hacked e-mail ac­counts of Nige­rian navy per­son­nel and Euro­pean and In­dian de­fence con­trac­tors.</p>
    <p>Main­te­nance man­u­als for the MQ-9 Reaper drone and US M1</p>
    <p>Abrams tank were avail­able too.</p>
    <p>In the last f i v e y e a r s , Mr Niemela’s re­search has led him to mil­i­tary doc­u­ments such as blue­prints for a fighter jet, ra­dios and drones; lo­gis­tics and sup­ply chain in­for­ma­tion about de­fence ven­dors; pric­ing in­for­ma­tion and peace­keep­ing op­er­a­tion in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>While clas­si­fied data usu­ally comes with a price tag, some hack­ers of­fer the in­for­ma­tion free, said Mr Muham­mad Faizal Ab­dul Rah­man, a re­search fel­low at the S. Ra­jarat­nam School of In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies.</p>
    <p>“To un­der­stand a ‘hack and leak’ cy­ber at­tack, it is es­sen­tial to as­sess the in­ten­tion of the pos­si­ble at­tack­ers, who may be ei­ther state-spon­sored or pa­tri­otic hack­ers,” Mr Faizal said.</p>
    <p>“In South-east Asia, cy­ber es­pi­onage against mil­i­tary agen­cies is not un­usual, in part due to ten­sions aris­ing from over­lap­ping claims in the South China Sea.”</p>
    <p>Stolen in­for­ma­tion may also be leaked if the vic­tim re­fuses to pay a ran­som.</p>
    <p>Ex­posed mil­i­tary se­crets float­ing in cy­berspace can be detri­men­tal to a na­tion’s se­cu­rity. This is be­cause the in­for­ma­tion re­sides where crim­i­nal and ter­ror net­works are known to co­ex­ist with other il­licit ac­tiv­i­ties in­volv­ing drug traf­fick­ing, pornog­ra­phy, fake cur­rency, weapons traf­fick­ing and ter­ror­ist com­mu­ni­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Added Mr Faizal: “The way the data is weaponised could un­der­cut na­tional de­fence by re­veal­ing mil­i­tary strengths and weak­nesses, serve as com­pro­mis­ing in­for­ma­tion that an ad­ver­sary could use to re­cruit mil­i­tary of­fi­cers as spies, and un­der­mine the peo­ple’s con­fi­dence in their po­lit­i­cal lead­er­ship.”</p>
    <p>But re­triev­ing the stolen data – usu­ally pre­sented as sam­ples – could con­trib­ute to the cy­cle of cy­bertheft.</p>
    <p>“Mil­i­taries around the world have the in­cen­tive to get that data to see how widely in­for­ma­tion has been com­pro­mised,” said Mr Niemela, who also leads a Dark Web re­search team in the United Na­tions Of­fice on Drugs and Crime.</p>
    <p>“Usu­ally the only way to get it is to pay, and then they end up fi­nanc­ing crime, which will even­tu­ally lead to more (cy­ber-at­tack) at­tempts.”</p>
    <p>Most of the leaks – in­clud­ing the ma­jor ones by Amer­i­can whistle­blower Ed­ward Snow­den in 2013 – are by in­sid­ers, Mr Niemela said.</p>
    <p>When the MQ-9 Reaper drone man­ual was first put up for sale on the Dark Web in 2015, in­ves­ti­ga­tors dis­cov­ered that a hacker “in­fil­trated the com­puter of a cap­tain at an air­craft main­te­nance unit (AMU) and stole a cache of sen­si­tive doc­u­ments, in­clud­ing Reaper main­te­nance course books and the list of air­men as­signed to Reaper AMU”, ac­cord­ing to a re­port by Recorded Fu­ture’s In­sikt Group, a Swedish cy­ber-se­cu­rity com­pany.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Niemela: “The in­for­ma­tion in­side mil­i­tary or­gan­i­sa­tions is al­ready com­part­men­talised, and very re­stric­tive data loss-pre­ven­tion mech­a­nisms have been ap­plied in ev­ery mod­ern mil­i­tary.”</p>
    <p>But as mil­i­tary sys­tems and pro­cesses be­come more com­plex, users may be prone to mis­takes that could be ex­ploited by hack­ers, he said.</p>
    <p>ST alerted the RMN re­gard­ing the leaked in­for­ma­tion, but a spokesman said “the RMN has no com­ment on the is­sue”.</p>

        <p data-role="text">The vil&#xAD;lage of Lidi in cen&#xAD;tral Nepal after a land&#xAD;slide oc&#xAD;curred, bury&#xAD;ing dozens of homes and killing at least 18 peo&#xAD;ple.&#xD;&#xA;Of&#xAD;fi&#xAD;cials said 21 peo&#xAD;ple were still miss&#xAD;ing after un&#xAD;usu&#xAD;ally heavy rain caused the hill to slip in the early hours of Fri&#xAD;day, re&#xAD;ported news agency Xinhua. The res&#xAD;cue op&#xAD;er&#xAD;a&#xAD;tion, in&#xAD;volv&#xAD;ing sol&#xAD;diers, po&#xAD;lice of&#xAD;fi&#xAD;cers, paramil&#xAD;i&#xAD;taries and res&#xAD;i&#xAD;dents con&#xAD;tin&#xAD;ued yes&#xAD;ter&#xAD;day.&#xD;&#xA;Sind&#xAD;hu&#xAD;pal&#xAD;chok district, which in&#xAD;cludes Lidi, sees fre&#xAD;quent land&#xAD;slides. Ac&#xAD;cord&#xAD;ing to The New York Times, it was one of the worst-hit ar&#xAD;eas in the April 2015 earth&#xAD;quake that killed over 8,700 peo&#xAD;ple in Nepal. Of those deaths, 3,440 were in Sind&#xAD;hu&#xAD;pal&#xAD;chok.&#xD;&#xA;Some of the 37 homes lost in Fri&#xAD;day&#x2019;s land&#xAD;slide had been re&#xAD;built after the 2015 quake.&#xD;&#xA;Res&#xAD;i&#xAD;dents were re&#xAD;lo&#xAD;cated over con&#xAD;cerns that an&#xAD;other land&#xAD;slide could oc&#xAD;cur. &#x201C;A nearby hill has also re&#xAD;mained split open and there are 25 houses be&#xAD;low that hill,&#x201D; Sind&#xAD;hu&#xAD;pal&#xAD;chowk&#x2019;s district po&#xAD;lice chief Pra&#xAD;j&#xAD;wol Ma&#xAD;har&#xAD;jan told Xinhua.&#xD;&#xA;Nepal&#x2019;s re&#xAD;mote, hilly re&#xAD;gions are of&#xAD;ten plagued by land&#xAD;slides dur&#xAD;ing the mon&#xAD;soon sea&#xAD;son from June to Septem&#xAD;ber. But of&#xAD;fi&#xAD;cials said the rain&#xAD;fall and the land&#xAD;slide death toll so far this sea&#xAD;son have been un&#xAD;prece&#xAD;dented. Nearly 200 peo&#xAD;ple are known to have died this year, with over 40 miss&#xAD;ing, said NYT.</p>
