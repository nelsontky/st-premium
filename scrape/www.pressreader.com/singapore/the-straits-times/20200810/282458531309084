    <p>BARCELONA • If Quique Se­tien is to re­main in the Barcelona hot seat be­yond this sum­mer, he will have to guide his side past Bay­ern Mu­nich in the Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>That is the task fac­ing the Cata­lan gi­ants af­ter they beat Napoli 3-1 on Satur­day to progress to the quar­ter-fi­nals 4-2 on ag­gre­gate.</p>
    <p>It was a far from con­vinc­ing dis­play at the Nou Camp but first-half goals from Cle­ment Len­glet, cap­tain Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez sent Barca on their way into the “Fi­nal Eight” tour­na­ment in Lis­bon.</p>
    <p>Their re­ward is a block­buster clash with the eight-time de­fend­ing Ger­man cham­pi­ons on Friday. Bay­ern romped into the last eight with a 4-1 rout of Chelsea on Satur­day, go­ing through 7-1 on ag­gre­gate, but Se­tien is not over­awed by their next op­po­nents.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics have in­stalled the Bavar­i­ans as favourites, point­ing out that Napoli dom­i­nated the sec­ond half, only for poor fin­ish­ing to cost them as they failed to add to Lorenzo In­signe’s penalty.</p>
    <p>Barca’s re­cently con­cluded do­mes­tic cam­paign has also been par­tic­u­larly un­der­whelm­ing and they re­main in danger of fin­ish­ing tro­phy­less for the first time since 2008.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Se­tien has in­sisted his side should not be un­der­es­ti­mated against Bay­ern, who in con­trast, swept to a do­mes­tic dou­ble.</p>
    <p>“It will be tough for us be­cause they’ve had an ex­cel­lent sea­son and dom­i­nated their tie,” he said. “It will be dif­fi­cult for us but also for them. They are an ex­cel­lent team, but so are we.”</p>
    <p>What may count i n Barca’s favour is that the Cham­pi­ons League has been changed to a knock­out for­mat from the last eight, with the pre­vi­ous two­legged ties ditched be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Suarez said: “In a one-off game, any­one has a chance, so it’s per­fectly bal­anced, 50-50. Bay­ern are a great team, one of the can­di­dates to win the com­pe­ti­tion, but it’s 11 v 11 over 90 min­utes.”</p>
    <p>His side have been haunted in the past two years, ca­pit­u­lat­ing to Roma and Liver­pool re­spec­tively de­spite hold­ing size­able first-leg leads, so Sergi Roberto is hope­ful the re­for­mat­ting of the tour­na­ment will work to their ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>“Every game is its own dif­fer­ent world and that is true now more than ever,” he said. “There are no favourites in this Cham­pi­ons League, any­one can win or lose a one-off game. Every match will feel like a fi­nal so we are go­ing to have to be very con­cen­trated.”</p>
