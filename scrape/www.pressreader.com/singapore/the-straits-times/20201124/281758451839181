    <p>• In­done­sia hit a grim mile­stone yes­ter­day in sur­pass­ing more than half a mil­lion cases of the coro­n­avirus, as hospi­tals across the coun­try’s most pop­u­lated province edged closer to­wards ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia now has 502,110 in­fec­tions and 16,002 deaths from Covid-19, the high­est num­bers in South-east Asia, hav­ing strug­gled to con­tain the spread since its first case in March.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic health ex­perts say short­falls in test­ing and con­tact trac­ing and a con­sis­tently high pos­i­tiv­ity rate in­di­cate the real num­bers are likely to be sig­nif­i­cantly higher.</p>
    <p>In the cap­i­tal Jakarta, where rel­a­tively loose so­cial curbs will stay in place till Dec 6, some met the mile­stone with glum res­ig­na­tion.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment isn’t se­ri­ous and the people are get­ting fa­tigued,” said clothes trader Ah­mad Rozali at Tanah Abang mar­ket.</p>
    <p>An­other trader, Ms Dewi Nu­raini, 45, said: “There’s an air of fear among the people.”</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing the econ­omy as “crum­bling”, she added: “If we want to start a busi­ness, it will meet a dead end.”</p>
    <p>In­done­sia has recorded a daily av­er­age of al­most 4,000 new cases so far this month, with a spike in some prov­inces strain­ing hospi­tals on the main island of Java.</p>
    <p>In Ban­dung, the cap­i­tal of West Java province, which has al­most 50 mil­lion people, oc­cu­pancy at 27 re­fer­ral hospi­tals was 88.8 per cent yes­ter­day, city sec­re­tary Ema Sur­mana told Reuters, with 698 of 786 beds for virus pa­tients taken.</p>
    <p>West Java epi­demi­ol­o­gist Panji For­tuna Hadis­oe­marto said lo­cal and na­tional trans­mis­sion pat­terns in­di­cate In­done­sia’s strug­gle with the virus is far from over.</p>
    <p>West Java’s oc­cu­pancy rate in its Covid-19 wards was 73 per cent, and also hov­er­ing above 70 per cent were Ban­ten and Cen­tral Java prov­inces, ac­cord­ing to an in­ter­nal Health Min­istry doc­u­ment seen by Reuters.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, new Covid-19 cases have been recorded fol­low­ing a se­ries of mass gath­er­ings cen­tred around the re­turn of Is­lamic De­fend­ers Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shi­hab from self-ex­ile in Saudi Ara­bia on Nov 10.</p>
    <p>He was mobbed by thou­sands of sup­port­ers at the Jakarta in­ter­na­tional air­port and thou­sands more at­tended his daugh­ter’s wed­ding on Nov 14, alarm­ing the health au­thor­i­ties. There were also gath­er­ings at FPI’s head­quar­ters in Pe­tam­bu­ran, Cen­tral Jakarta.</p>
    <p>Data re­ceived by the na­tional Covid-19 task force last Thursday re­vealed that seven out 15 people who had taken swab tests in Pe­tam­bu­ran turned out to be pos­i­tive for the dis­ease.</p>
