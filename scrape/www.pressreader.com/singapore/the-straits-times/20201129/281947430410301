    <p>When 33-year-old Eu­dora Tan made the switch to early child­hood ed­u­ca­tion from ar­chi­tec­ture five years ago, there were many who ques­tioned her de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>She had spent five years study­ing to be an ar­chi­tect at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, in­clud­ing com­plet­ing a mas­ter’s de­gree.</p>
    <p>“To them, ar­chi­tec­ture seemed like a pro­fes­sion that took me such a long time to learn, but I gave it up after just a few years of work­ing,” said Ms Tan.</p>
    <p>She found the work too de­mand­ing be­cause of the long hours in­volved, and de­cided to try some­thing dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>“I’ve al­ways had the op­por­tu­nity to be with chil­dren, whether at Sun­day school in church or with my neph­ews, and that got me think­ing – that I do like work­ing with them.”</p>
    <p>In 2014, Ms Tan took the leap by tak­ing a Diploma (Con­ver­sion) in Kin­der­garten Ed­u­ca­tion-Teach­ing at Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic. She joined St James’ Church Kin­der­garten (Gil­stead) as a math­e­mat­ics teacher in 2015, and was pro­moted to prin­ci­pal in July this year.</p>
    <p>She re­ceived the Out­stand­ing Early Child­hood Teacher Award at the Early Child­hood De­vel­op­ment Agency Awards for Ex­cel­lence in Early Child­hood De­vel­op­ment vir­tual cer­e­mony yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“I just en­joy go­ing to school – the chil­dren are amaz­ing. I sim­ply love the con­ver­sa­tions with them, they re­veal their cu­riosi­ties and their thought pro­cesses.”</p>
    <p>Her train­ing as an ar­chi­tect has been put to good use, said Ms Tan, who is mar­ried and has a two-year-old son.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing an ar­chi­tect is not just about de­sign, but see­ing a pro­ject through and think­ing about how to solve prob­lems, work­ing through the de­tails.</p>
    <p>“It has trans­lated into how I work with chil­dren, by help­ing them to solve prob­lems in­stead of just giv­ing them the an­swers.”</p>
    <p>She added: “I may not be de­sign­ing a build­ing but I am build­ing the lives of the chil­dren, and that goes a long way.”</p>
