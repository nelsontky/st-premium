    <p>During the third quar­ter, we of­fered se­lect em­ploy­ees... to opt for early re­lease through a mu­tu­ally agreed sep­a­ra­tion scheme, in the light of the sus­tained im­pact of Covid-19 on some parts of our busi­ness.</p>
    <p>AN ST EN­GI­NEER­ING SPOKESMAN on the scheme, adding that those who did not ac­cept the of­fer were re­de­ployed.</p>
    <p>ST En­gi­neer­ing has of­fered some of its em­ploy­ees the op­tion of “early re­lease” from their jobs, but stressed that it was not en­gag­ing in a re­trench­ment ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to queries from The Straits T i me s , a company spokesman said: “During the third quar­ter, we of­fered se­lect em­ploy­ees... to opt for early re­lease through a mu­tu­ally agreed sep­a­ra­tion scheme, in the light of the sus­tained im­pact of Covid-19 on some parts of our busi­ness.”</p>
    <p>ST En­gi­neer­ing, which em­ploys about 23,000 peo­ple world­wide, did not say how many em­ploy­ees were of­fered the scheme or how many ac­cepted the of­fer.</p>
    <p>“That was not a re­trench­ment ex­er­cise. Em­ploy­ees who did not ac­cept the scheme were re­de­ployed,” the spokesman added.</p>
    <p>She said the group was, and con­tin­ues to be, sig­nif­i­cantly im­pacted by Covid-19 due to a drop in cus­tomer de­mand, sup­ply chain chal­lenges and work­force dis­rup­tions.</p>
    <p>To stay vi­able as a busi­ness, ST En­gi­neer­ing has been im­ple­ment­ing cost-sav­ing mea­sures to mit­i­gate the im­pact of Covid-19, the spokesman added. These mea­sures in­clude de­fer­ment of dis­cre­tionary cap­i­tal ex­pen­di­ture, tight­en­ing of op­er­at­ing ex­pen­di­ture in­clud­ing staff and staff-re­lated ex­penses, cuts in pro­mo­tional ex­penses re­lated to trade ex­hi­bi­tions and sus­pen­sion of busi­ness travel.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, the main­board­listed company said in a third-quar­ter busi­ness up­date that it ex­pects full-year rev­enue to be around 10 per cent lower for FY2020 than in FY2019. This fol­lowed its an­nounce­ment on Tues­day that the company will be re­struc­tured into two main clus­ters from Jan­uary next year – com­mer­cial, and de­fence and pub­lic se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>It is cur­rently or­gan­ised ac­cord­ing to sec­tors: aero­space, elec­tron­ics, land sys­tems and marine.</p>
    <p>The spokesman yesterday also stressed that the group’s re­or­gan­i­sa­tion is not a cost ra­tio­nal­i­sa­tion ex­er­cise, but a move to bet­ter po­si­tion the company for global growth and suc­cess.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral com­pa­nies badly af­fected by the pandemic have also of­fered their staff early re­lease or re­tire­ment pack­ages.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA), which was op­er­at­ing at only 7 per cent of its sched­uled ca­pac­ity, in­tro­duced a vol­un­tary re­tire­ment scheme for its cabin crew in Au­gust. A month later, SIA Group an­nounced about 2,400 staff would be re­trenched.</p>
    <p>Last month, em­ploy­ers were given the green light by the Na­tional Wages Coun­cil to im­ple­ment tem­po­rary wage cuts if it means sav­ing jobs.</p>
