    <p>Whether it is with a large firm or a small en­ter­prise, ris­ing through the ranks to take on a lead­er­ship role in a com­pany takes years of hard work and learn­ing along the way.</p>
    <p>But even af­ter reach­ing the pin­na­cle, ex­perts say, it is im­por­tant for se­nior lead­ers to keep up­grad­ing their skills.</p>
    <p>“Due to in­creased dis­rup­tion, along with the ever-chang­ing con­text of busi­ness, tech­nol­ogy and so­ci­ety in Asia, the need for lead­er­ship de­vel­op­ment is more pro­nounced than ever,” said Cen­tre for Cre­ative Lead­er­ship manag­ing direc­tor and vice-pres­i­dent for</p>
    <p>Asia-Pa­cific, Ms Elisa Mal­lis.</p>
    <p>She added that this is es­pe­cially ap­par­ent as the past one year has chal­lenged as­sump­tions on busi­ness mod­els, work­flows, tech­nol­ogy and people.</p>
    <p>In­sti­tute for Hu­man Re­source Pro­fes­sion­als chief ex­ec­u­tive Mayank Parekh echoed the view, say­ing lead­ers, like all work­ers, should keep pace with tech­no­log­i­cal changes and the per­va­sive use of dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing and com­mu­ni­ca­tion tools. How adept lead­ers are at this de­pends on their per­sonal goals and mo­ti­va­tions.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­i­sa­tions with lead­ers who con­tinue to learn set a good ex­am­ple for staff by demon­strat­ing that learn­ing is age­less, said Singapore Hu­man Re­sources In­sti­tute pres­i­dent Low Peck Kem.</p>
    <p>Ex­ec­u­tive coach Su­man Balani, who is manag­ing direc­tor of Flour­ish Con­sult­ing, said lead­ers with such a mind­set know there are al­ways ar­eas to grow as a per­son.</p>
    <p>Those who con­tinue to up­grade their skills are ef­fec­tive lead­ers who bal­ance their per­for­mance with emo­tion­ally in­tel­li­gent con­duct, she added.</p>
    <p>“The or­gan­i­sa­tion will ben­e­fit from bet­ter en­gaged staff, im­pact­ful re­sults and hap­pier teams,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ex­am­ples of cour­ses se­nior lead­ers could at­tend are ad­vanced man­age­ment pro­grammes in busi­ness schools.</p>
    <p>They could also learn tech­ni­cal skills to broaden their ca­pa­bil­i­ties or deepen their in­dus­try knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>Mr Parekh, for ex­am­ple, said he has taken on­line cour­ses in sub­jects such as data an­a­lyt­ics and ma­chine learn­ing, which he found very help­ful to his work.</p>
    <p>Ms Balani said di­ver­sity and in­clu­sion is now a hot topic in multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tions. She pro­vides coach­ing for a pro­gramme in which lead­ers dis­cuss un­con­scious bi­ases and learn to bring out an en­vi­ron­ment which sup­ports di­ver­sity, eq­uity and in­clu­sion.</p>
    <p>In small and medium-sized en­ter­prises, the fo­cus is more about build­ing lead­er­ship ca­pac­ity and en­gage­ment to max­imise per­for­mance, she said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it can be chal­leng­ing for a chief ex­ec­u­tive and other se­nior lead­ers to at­tend train­ing. De­vot­ing time for it is one is­sue.</p>
    <p>Some lead­ers may also not know where to start or have dif­fi­culty stay­ing the course, said Mr Parekh, adding that pro­fes­sional bod­ies have a ma­jor role to play in this re­spect.</p>
    <p>They can cu­rate and sig­nal emerg­ing ar­eas, build a net­work for peer-to-peer learn­ing and set stan­dards and recog­ni­tion.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has also thrown a span­ner in the works for some com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Ms Mal­lis said: “Covid-19 came across like a wreck­ing ball and ac­cel­er­ated years of change in a few months.</p>
    <p>“Sev­eral or­gan­i­sa­tional chal­lenges re­lated to train­ing and up­skilling were am­pli­fied: tighter bud­get, even higher ex­pec­ta­tions and ur­gency for lead­ers to go faster and bal­ance many things, huge amounts of change and restruc­tur­ing and re­trench­ment in some cases, as well as fa­tigue and burn out.”</p>
    <p>Another fac­tor to con­sider is whether the train­ing is de­liv­ered ef­fec­tively, said Ms Balani.</p>
    <p>“Hon­estly, when I was a se­nior leader, I of­ten felt all th­ese pro­grammes were a waste of time – we could not link their rel­e­vance to the pos­si­ble im­pact on the self, team and the or­gan­i­sa­tion and busi­ness – no one could ex­plain their rel­e­vance.</p>
    <p>“Also many were de­signed with just train­ing pro­grammes which were for­got­ten once the class was over. I have come to re­alise that the most ef­fec­tive model is to have mi­cro-cus­tomised train­ing with coach­ing sup­port to en­sure in­te­gra­tion and spe­cific learn­ing that is specif­i­cally rel­e­vant to the leader,” she said.</p>
    <p>Learn­ing can and should con­tinue even af­ter the top job is done, said Ms Low.</p>
    <p>She said that when se­nior lead­ers make way for suc­ces­sors, they have to en­sure they reskill them­selves for their new role. It could be skills re­lated to coach­ing, ad­vi­sory and con­sult­ing, rather than run­ning day-to-day oper­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“Se­nior lead­ers def­i­nitely need to reskill to re­main rel­e­vant af­ter they step aside or step down to en­sure a smooth tran­si­tion and at the same time, ex­er­cise self-care for them­selves to en­sure that they re­main rel­e­vant do­ing the things they love to do,” she said.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­i­sa­tions with lead­ers who con­tinue to learn set a good ex­am­ple for staff by demon­strat­ing that learn­ing is age­less, says Singapore Hu­man Re­sources In­sti­tute pres­i­dent Low Peck Kem.</p>
