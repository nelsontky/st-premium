    <p>BRUSSELS • Lead­ers of Europe’s coro­n­avirus-stricken travel and tourism in­dus­tries have ap­pealed to the Euro­pean Union’s chief ex­ec­u­tive to press gov­ern­ments to end quar­an­tine re­quire­ments and in­stead em­brace co­or­di­nated re­stric­tions and test­ing.</p>
    <p>“This chaotic sit­u­a­tion re­quires your im­me­di­ate per­sonal in­volve­ment,” a broad ad hoc group of more than 20 in­dus­try groups, in­clud­ing air­line body Iata, told Euro­pean Com­mis­sion Pres­i­dent Ur­sula von der Leyen in a let­ter seen by Reuters.</p>
    <p>The ap­peal came as data from air­ports group ACI Europe, one of the sig­na­to­ries to the let­ter that was is­sued on Thurs­day, pointed to a “dou­ble-dip” slump in air traf­fic, with pas­sen­ger num­bers down 73 per cent in the first two weeks of this month, af­ter a 65 per cent de­cline last month.</p>
    <p>The EU ex­ec­u­tive this month pro­posed a com­mon “traf­fic light” sys­tem de­signed to co­or­di­nate travel re­stric­tions among EU states and re­place the patch­work of rules and quar­an­tine regimes blamed for the re­newed col­lapse in travel.</p>
    <p>But with Covid-19 cases ris­ing, gov­ern­ments are re­luc­tant to drop more dras­tic re­stric­tions and quar­an­tines – con­demned by the in­dus­try as dis­pro­por­tion­ate to the risks of travel within a re­gion where com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion is al­ready wide­spread.</p>
    <p>Ire­land, where travel curbs have been chal­lenged in court by Ryanair, moved on Thurs­day to quar­an­tine arrivals from Italy and Greece on the ba­sis of stricter in­fec­tion-rate cri­te­ria than those pro­posed by the EU.</p>
    <p>“Fail­ure to fully im­ple­ment the com­mis­sion’s pro­posal would kill any chances of a po­ten­tial re­cov­ery,” the travel in­dus­try bod­ies wrote to Ms Von der Leyen.</p>
    <p>The let­ter was signed by an al­pha­bet soup of trade bod­ies to­gether rep­re­sent­ing more than 5,000 com­pa­nies and mil­lions of work­ers in sec­tors rang­ing from avi­a­tion and travel agents to ho­tels, restau­rants and camp­sites, and their sup­ply chains.</p>
    <p>“We are thus urg­ing you make this is­sue a top pri­or­ity” in dis­cus­sions with na­tional lead­ers, it added, high­light­ing the 10 per cent of EU eco­nomic out­put gen­er­ated by tourism and its 12 per cent share of the work­force.</p>
    <p>“What is ac­tu­ally at stake is the re­cov­ery of Europe and Euro­pean economies.”</p>
    <p>In a non-bind­ing vote on Thurs­day, EU law­mak­ers urged mem­ber states to adopt com­mon method­olo­gies in their fight against the pan­demic, ahead of a meet­ing on Tues­day of Euro­pean Af­fairs min­is­ters that will ad­dress bet­ter co­or­di­nated bor­der con­trols.</p>
