    <p>LON­DON • Manch­ester United man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer in­sisted he will not set­tle for the point that would guar­an­tee his side a re­turn to the Cham­pi­ons League next sea­son when the Red Devils travel to Le­ices­ter to­day.</p>
    <p>United sit third in the Premier League ta­ble on 63 points go­ing into the fi­nal day of the sea­son, but de­feat by the Foxes (62) at the King Power Sta­dium would see them fall to fifth should Chelsea (63) avoid los­ing at home to Wolves.</p>
    <p>TO FIN­ISH IN THE TOP FOUR</p>
    <p>“We’ve given our­selves a good chance of be­ing in the Cham­pi­ons League next year but we can’t go into a game think­ing about what the out­come can be,” said Sol­sk­jaer.</p>
    <p>“We’ve just got to go and per­form and per­form at a high enough level and stan­dard so we can get a re­sult.</p>
    <p>“We want to go there and dom­i­nate the game. We wanted to get this po­si­tion to be able to go to Le­ices­ter and hav­ing to beat them, and we’re not go­ing to change our ap­proach. We want to go there and try and win the game.”</p>
    <p>United have over­turned an eight­point deficit to Le­ices­ter in the eight games since English foot­ball’s re­turn from the three-month Covid hia­tus, but have looked low on en­ergy in re­cent games as they crashed out of the FA Cup to Chelsea last week­end and were held 1-1 at home by West Ham on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Nor­we­gian stresses he is still de­lighted with the progress that has been made, with his side on a 13-match un­beaten run in the league stretch­ing back to Jan­uary, when they lost 2-0 to Burn­ley.</p>
    <p>The for­mer United striker, 47, over­saw the club’s worst start to a top-flight cam­paign in 30 years and faced ques­tions about his suit­abil­ity for the team’s re­build­ing, but United have turned things around in the sec­ond half of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>They can also se­cure their high­est fin­ish since the 2017-18 sea­son, when Jose Mour­inho guided them to sec­ond place.</p>
    <p>“We’ve had some hard times this sea­son, some set­backs, but we have shown this is a team go­ing places,” Sol­sk­jaer added.</p>
    <p>“We’re go­ing to go into it with a strong frame of mind. It’s not job done, we have one more game in this sea­son. That’s this sea­son, and this is a jour­ney for this team.</p>
    <p>“Men­tally I think we’ve shown more ro­bust­ness, re­silience, when we’ve lost the first goal in games, for ex­am­ple, but we’ve also shown the heights when every­thing’s flow­ing.</p>
    <p>“We’ve got our best play­ers fit and rar­ing to go. I’m de­lighted with how the de­vel­op­ment looks.”</p>
    <p>Luke Shaw and Eric Bailly are doubt­ful for to­day, while Le­ices­ter are with­out the sus­pended Caglar Soyuncu and the in­jured quin­tet of Ben Chilwell, Ri­cardo Pereira, Chris­tian Fuchs, Daniel Amartey and James Mad­di­son.</p>
    <p>A re­turn to the Cham­pi­ons League is vi­tal for the health of United’s fi­nances, but they will have a sec­ond chance even if they lose at Le­ices­ter by win­ning the Europa League when it re­turns next month. The Red Devils are 5-0 up against Lask and will host the Aus­trian side in the sec­ond leg of their last-16 clash on Aug 5.</p>
    <p>Le­ices­ter man­ager Bren­dan Rodgers, mean­while, has called on his play­ers to give it one last shot.</p>
    <p>“What they have done has been ab­so­lutely bril­liant up un­til this point. Now they have the chance to make a re­sult that will be heard around the world. Let’s go and en­joy it,” he said.</p>
