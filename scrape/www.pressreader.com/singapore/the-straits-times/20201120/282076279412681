    <p>A mar­ried busi­ness­man from China who was woo­ing a flight at­ten­dant bought her a $3 mil­lion apart­ment at The In­ter­lace as a birth­day present.</p>
    <p>On the day she signed pur­chase</p>
    <p>doc­u­ments, he told her to or­der a Mercedes-Benz of her choice.</p>
    <p>Af­ter they be­gan their af­fair, Mr Xu Zhi­gang trans­ferred two sums to­talling US$9.6 mil­lion (S$12.9 mil­lion) to Ms Wang Fang, in July 2014 and Fe­bru­ary 2015. Their re­la­tion­ship ended in Novem­ber 2017.</p>
    <p>Last year, Mr Xu sued his for­mer mis­tress to get back the money, the apart­ment and the car, claim</p>
    <p>ing that she was hold­ing them on trust for him. Ms Wang, who re­fused to re­turn the as­sets, ar­gued that they were gifts.</p>
    <p>Yesterday, Mr Xu largely suc­ceeded in his claim to get back the money, af­ter the High Court al­lowed him to re­cover about US$9.4 mil­lion (S$12.7 mil­lion) from Ms Wang.</p>
    <p>In a writ­ten judg­ment, Jus­tice Au</p>
    <p>drey Lim ac­cepted Mr Xu’s ex­pla­na­tion that the sums of money were moved to Ms Wang for tem­po­rary safe­keep­ing as his com­pa­nies in China were fac­ing fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties at the time.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the judge dis­missed Mr Xu’s claims re­gard­ing the apart­ment and the car, which she con</p>
    <p>The judge ac­cepted Mr Xu’s ex­pla­na­tion that he had trans­ferred US$2.6 mil­lion to Ms Wang as part of a plan to in­su­late East­port from his troubles in China.</p>
    <p>There was also ev­i­dence to sup­port Mr Xu’s ex­pla­na­tion that he had trans­ferred US$7 mil­lion to Ms Wang to keep funds out of reach of po­ten­tial cred­i­tors, and to en­able him to res­tart his busi­ness.</p>
    <p>cluded were gifts.</p>
    <p>Mr Xu, who is in his 40s, used to be the main share­holder of East­port Petro­chem­i­cal (Sin­ga­pore).</p>
    <p>He first met Ms Wang on a flight in 2011.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore they be­gan a ro­man­tic re­la­tion­ship in Fe­bru­ary 2014, Mr Xu plied her with gifts and gave her ben­e­fits, in­clud­ing the use of his ATM card linked to his bank ac­count where his salary of $20,000 per month was de­posited.</p>
    <p>Be­tween De­cem­ber 2013 and Fe­bru­ary 2014, Mr Xu trans­ferred $4.2 mil­lion to Ms Wang to buy the apart­ment and the car, both of which were reg­is­tered in her name. He also got a job for her at his company, which paid her $10,000 a month be­tween April 2014 and June 2016, although she did not do any sub­stan­tive work.</p>
    <p>From end Jan­uary to early Fe­bru­ary 2014, the pair spent time to­gether in China, in­clud­ing vis­it­ing Ms Wang’s par­ents during Chi­nese New Year.</p>
    <p>Around Fe­bru­ary 2014, she dis­cov­ered that Mr Xu had had an­other re­la­tion­ship, but he as­sured her that he was no longer see­ing the other woman, who worked at his company.</p>
    <p>In his law­suit, Mr Xu, who was rep­re­sented by Se­nior Coun­sel Tan Chee Meng, claimed he had bought the apart­ment to im­prove Ms Wang’s liv­ing con­di­tions as he re­garded her as a sib­ling.</p>
    <p>Mr Xu said he bought the car as he needed to meet cus­tomers in Sin­ga­pore. He said he told Ms Wang he would let her drive it, and was not buy­ing it for her.</p>
    <p>He said the apart­ment and the car were reg­is­tered in her name to make it con­ve­nient for her to han­dle ad­min­is­tra­tive mat­ters con­cern­ing the as­sets.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Lim said Mr Xu’s ex­pla­na­tions were un­con­vinc­ing.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the judge ac­cepted his ex­pla­na­tion that he had trans­ferred US$2.6 mil­lion to Ms Wang as part of a plan to in­su­late East­port from his troubles in China.</p>
    <p>There was also ev­i­dence to sup­port Mr Xu’s ex­pla­na­tion that he had trans­ferred US$7 mil­lion to Ms Wang to keep funds out of reach of po­ten­tial cred­i­tors, and to en­able him to res­tart his busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Ms Wang, who was rep­re­sented by Se­nior Coun­sel Lee Eng Beng, said Mr Xu gave her the money to show his sin­cer­ity and grat­i­tude for stay­ing with him and to give her a sense of se­cu­rity.</p>
