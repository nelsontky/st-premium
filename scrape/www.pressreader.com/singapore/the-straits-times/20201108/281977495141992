    <p>Nightlife es­tab­lish­ments – bars, pubs, night­clubs, dis­cothe­ques and karaoke lounges – can look for­ward to a new lease of life with the an­nounce­ment that a lim­ited num­ber will be al­lowed to re­open un­der a pi­lot trial with strin­gent safe man­age­ment mea­sures in place. This is a sen­si­ble way of as­sess­ing the vi­a­bil­ity of safety and other mea­sures nec­es­sary to pre­vent a mass out­break of coro­n­avirus cases. If the small num­ber of out­lets tak­ing part in the pi­lot pro­gramme are able to suc­cess­fully com­ply with safety mea­sures, there would be a case for ex­pan­sion, thus al­low­ing more es­tab­lish­ments to re­sume op­er­a­tions. Do­ing so will brighten and im­prove prospects for an in­dus­try that has been hard-hit for nearly nine months now.</p>
    <p>But the re­sump­tion of ac­tiv­i­ties at se­lected nightlife venues is, un­der­stand­ably, be­ing ap­proached with pru­dence and cau­tion. The goa­head for pubs and bars will com­mence by De­cem­ber and last for two months. As for karaoke lounges and night­clubs, their pi­lot pro­gramme will com­mence by Jan­uary next year and last three months. The safety of pa­trons and staff, in par­tic­u­lar, and of the pub­lic in gen­eral is the para­mount con­sid­er­a­tion, as it should be. Any pre­ma­ture re­lax­ation of re­stric­tions on so­cial gath­er­ings could have un­in­tended and dire con­se­quences that would ne­ces­si­tate a fur­ther painful lock­down. Sin­ga­pore­ans would do well to re­mem­ber how sim­i­lar ac­tiv­i­ties else­where con­trib­uted to re­newed out­breaks of the coro­n­avirus. Still, rev­ellers miss­ing the nightlife will find some com­fort in the de­ci­sion, not least be­cause it spans the fes­tive pe­riod from the end of this year to the early part of next year. Some es­tab­lish­ments not un­der the pi­lot may opt to pivot to other ac­tiv­i­ties, or exit the in­dus­try. Hard as that de­ci­sion will be on them and their em­ploy­ees, they will at least re­ceive as­sis­tance to make that tran­si­tion.</p>
