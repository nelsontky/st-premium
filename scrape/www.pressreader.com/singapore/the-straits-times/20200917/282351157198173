    <p>Ex­ist­ing StarHub sports pack­age sub­scribers will be able to watch their favourite Ger­man foot­ball clubs live in ac­tion at no ad­di­tional cost from this sea­son.</p>
    <p>StarHub on Tues­day an­nounced a new multi-year deal to air Bun­desliga and Bun­desliga 2 matches, and be­come the league’s of­fi­cial telco part­ner in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>As part of the agree­ment with Bun­desliga In­ter­na­tional, fans will be able to watch the Ger­man Su­per Cup and end-of-sea­son promotion and rel­e­ga­tion play-off matches, in ad­di­tion to the league games – more than 200 matches in to­tal – on the telco’s plat­forms.</p>
    <p>StarHub con­sumer busi­ness group chief Jo­han Buse said: “We are de­lighted to bring Bun­desliga, one of the most pop­u­lar foot­ball leagues in the world, to Sin­ga­pore for the com­ing sea­sons, and look for­ward to pro­vid­ing our cus­tomers with a new and re­fresh­ing Bun­desliga ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>StarHub will be launch­ing a Bun­desliga mi­crosite, which will host match high­lights, match-day clips and the Bun­desliga Re­port – a show that will fea­ture stars, stories and ex­clu­sive be­hind-the-scenes con­tent.</p>
    <p>Fans will also be able to watch two ad­di­tional pro­grammes – Bun­desliga Weekly and Best of the Month – for lat­est up­dates on team news and key play­ers for each match ev­ery Thurs­day, while look­ing back at the best goals, matches and play­ers for each month.</p>
    <p>Sup­port­ers can also look for­ward to in­ter­ac­tions with their favourite teams and play­ers through subscriber-only events such as mee­tand-greet ses­sions or so­cial me­dia con­tests to win jer­seys as the sea­son pro­gresses.</p>
    <p>Bun­desliga In­ter­na­tional chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Robert Klein said: “This agree­ment is not only about bring­ing the best cov­er­age of our world-class play­ers and clubs, but also get­ting closer to the fans by work­ing with StarHub and its ex­ten­sive reach in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>The new Bun­desliga cam­paign kicks off on Satur­day, when Euro­pean and Ger­man cham­pi­ons Bay­ern Mu­nich host Schalke in their bid to ex­tend their record to nine con­sec­u­tive league ti­tles.</p>
    <p>Bay­ern fan Ja­son Tan said: “Over the years, we have seen Ger­man club foot­ball rise to be­come Euro­pean pow­er­houses, with Bay­ern win­ning the lat­est Cham­pi­ons League fi­nal.</p>
    <p>“As an ex­ist­ing sports pack­age subscriber, it’s great that we will be able to con­tinue en­joy­ing live Bun­desliga games on StarHub, watch some of the best young tal­ents such as Alphonso Davies com­pete, and get to know more about them.”</p>
    <p>Fans can sub­scribe to the StarHub Sports+ Pass at $20 per month.</p>
