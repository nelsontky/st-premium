    <p>What can a movie say about teenage preg­nancy that has not been said a mil­lion times over on tele­vi­sion or in films?</p>
    <p>The dar­ingly sim­ple Never</p>
    <p>Rarely Some­times Al­ways (NC16, 102 min­utes, opens to­day at the Pro­jec­tor, ) asks just one thing of the viewer: Be with Au­tumn (Sid­ney Flani­gan, in a re­mark­able de­but) over sev­eral of the most dif­fi­cult days of her young life – and just feel.</p>
    <p>Writer-di­rec­tor El­iza Hittman’s screen­play is sparse with in­for­ma­tion. Au­tumn is tight-lipped, even to best friend and cousin Sky­lar (Talia Ry­der). When she chooses to have an abor­tion, the au­di­ence is not privy as to why.</p>
    <p>Any Amer­i­can movie that has abor­tion as its trig­ger­ing event is, by def­i­ni­tion, a po­lit­i­cal movie – whether its mak­ers want to dive into those wa­ters or not. Hittman adopts a doc­u­men­tary-like mode of quiet ob­ser­va­tion: Au­tumn and Sky­lar, mak­ing their way from their con­ser­va­tive state to the more abor­tion-friendly New York, are forced to grow up be­fore their time.</p>
    <p>This is a project that feels tai­lor-made for melo­drama, but Hittman never reaches for the big notes. In­stead, she places her trust in the emo­tional power of ob­served de­tail.</p>
    <p>In one heart­break­ing scene, Au­tumn is run through a sex­ual abuse check­list; the choices of an­swers give the film its ti­tle. In an­other, she is given flawed ad­vice by re­li­giously mo­ti­vated med­i­cal pro­fes­sion­als. When one is young, poor and vul­ner­a­ble, this is the help one gets or none at all.</p>
    <p>Hittman never pulls the cam­era away, let­ting the facts of the teen’s plight ac­cu­mu­late, mak­ing the point that Au­tumn’s or­deal is tragic, yet hor­ri­fy­ingly com­mon­place.</p>
    <p>An­other film cen­tred on a pow­er­ful fe­male char­ac­ter is ac­tion thriller The Hunt (M18, 90 min­utes, opens to­day, ).</p>
    <p>Mil­i­tary vet­eran Crys­tal (Betty Gilpin) wakes up in a park one day and must dis­cover its se­crets be­fore she be­comes one of its many dead. Un­known per­sons have kid­napped her, along with about a dozen oth­ers, and are hunt­ing her group for sport.</p>
    <p>This movie takes an old thriller premise – that hu­mans are the ul­ti­mate hunt­ing tro­phy – but gives it a po­lit­i­cal twist by mak­ing the hunted and hunters peo­ple from dif­fer­ent ends of the Amer­i­can left-right po­lit­i­cal spec­trum.</p>
    <p>As the say­ing goes, you do not in­tro­duce a loaded gun in Act One with­out fir­ing it be­fore the cur­tain falls, but that is what hap­pens with the po­lit­i­cal satire – the setup fiz­zles away to noth­ing as the story pri­mar­ily con­cerns it­self with cat-and-mouse car­nage.</p>
    <p>Gilpin, as the tough-as-nails Creasey, is one re­deem­ing fea­ture. Her de­liv­ery of her lines car­ries old-fash­ioned machismo, but is mod­er­ated with a more con­tem­po­rary vul­ner­a­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing of satire, a vein of it runs through the drama The Burnt</p>
    <p>Or­ange Heresy (R21, 99 min­utes, opens to­day, ).</p>
    <p>Dan­ish ac­tor Claes Bang, re­cently seen in art-world satire The Square (2017), once again plays a char­ac­ter who bluffs and flat­ters his way to com­fort­able liv­ing among peo­ple much wealth­ier than he is.</p>
    <p>The black com­edy el­e­ments, com­pared with The Square, are much more muted, though. Bang’s Figueras is an art critic whose words carry weight. When Cas­sidy (rock star Mick Jag­ger, turn­ing in a fine per­for­mance) in­vites Figueras to his Tus­can villa to cat­a­logue his col­lec­tion, the critic meets Cas­sidy’s house guest, the leg­endary but reclu­sive painter Deb­ney (Don­ald Suther­land).</p>
    <p>Deb­ney, Figueras and Berenice (El­iz­a­beth De­bicki) – Figueras’ new lover – be­gin a friend­ship, one marked by an im­bal­ance of power. In arts and cul­ture, cre­ators like Deb­ney are the suns around which plan­ets like Figueras and Cas­sidy re­volve – and if they are just a bit sadis­tic, as the charm­ing Deb­ney seems to be, life can be mis­er­able for those hang­ing on.</p>
    <p>Di­rec­tor Giuseppe Capo­tondi, work­ing with a screen­play by</p>
    <p>Scott Smith (an Os­car nom­i­nee for his script for noir thriller A Sim­ple Plan, 1998) gets fine per­for­mances from ev­ery­one, even though their char­ac­ters and the story never snap into sat­is­fy­ing fo­cus.</p>
    <p>Christo­pher Nolan’s land­mark 2010 science-fic­tion thriller re­turns as In­cep­tion 10th</p>
    <p>An­niver­sary (PG, 162 min­utes, opens to­day, ).</p>
    <p>Aimed at re­watch­ers and those too young for its first run, this cut is the same as the one that came out a decade ago. The bonus ma­te­rial is a be­hind-the-scenes short film about Nolan’s next science-fic­tion project, Tenet, which opens here on Aug 27 and is an Asian ex­clu­sive.</p>
    <p>Is it worth watch­ing again on a large screen? Fans of the work al­ready know the an­swer. For those on the fence, it might be worth an­other look for two rea­sons: To see how a master like Nolan makes big ac­tion feel not just re­al­is­tic but also po­etic; and to scratch the block­buster itch un­til Tenet and other big-bud­get movies come along.</p>
    <p>Other films open­ing this week but not re­viewed in­clude dis­as­ter thriller Green­land (PG13, 120 min­utes, opens to­day). As a comet nears col­li­sion with Earth, Gar­rity (Gerard But­ler), his wife Al­li­son (Morena Bac­carin) and their son must fight their way to the is­land na­tion of the film’s ti­tle to shel­ter in a spe­cially con­structed struc­ture.</p>
    <p>In hor­ror film The Wretched (NC16, 96 min­utes, opens to­day), teenager Ben (John-Paul Howard) be­comes the only per­son who can see a fe­male ghoul hunt­ing the young fam­ily liv­ing next door. He has to find the in­ner strength to stop the de­mon be­fore it de­stroys the en­tire fam­ily.</p>
