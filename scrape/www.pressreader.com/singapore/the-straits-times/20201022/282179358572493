    <p>The let­ter by Mr Ron Ng Yong Kiang needs fur­ther elu­ci­da­tion (Is China the threat or the threat­ened?, Oct 20).</p>
    <p>The United States has im­posed sanc­tions on se­nior of­fi­cials in the In­ter­na­tional Crim­i­nal Court (ICC), in­clud­ing chief prose­cu­tor Fa­tou Ben­souda. Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo ac­cused the court of “il­le­git­i­mate at­tempts to sub­ject Amer­i­cans to its ju­ris­dic­tion”.</p>
    <p>The Hague-based ICC is cur­rently in­ves­ti­gat­ing whether US forces com­mit­ted war crimes in Afghanista­n. The US has crit­i­cised the court since its foun­da­tion and is one of a dozen states that do not ac­cept the ICC’s ju­ris­dic­tion.</p>
    <p>Yet not one word from the US’ al­lies – Aus­tralia, New Zealand and Canada – on this in­jus­tice.</p>
    <p>Imag­ine the same re­ac­tion if China were to do it.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain is now on the verge of break­ing in­ter­na­tional law over Brexit in a very “spe­cific and lim­ited” way, but there is zero con­dem­na­tion from Aus­tralia, New Zealand, Canada and the US.</p>
    <p>Yet they were up in vo­cif­er­ous con­dem­na­tion of China and</p>
    <p>Hong Kong when they im­ple­mented their own se­cu­rity laws. Why is that?</p>
    <p>Break­ing a law, be it a lit­tle bit or wholly, is the same. If Bri­tain does not re­spect in­ter­na­tional law, how can it ex­pect others to do so.</p>
    <p>By the same means, can China “break in­ter­na­tional law in a very spe­cific and lim­ited way”?</p>
    <p>Some ex­am­ples of how in­ter­na­tional law has been used or bro­ken in the past year in­clude how Bri­tain con­demned China for its new se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish For­eign Sec­re­tary Dominic Raab said China was in “se­ri­ous vi­o­la­tion” of the coun­try’s in­ter­na­tional obli­ga­tions. Yet it seems that it is ac­cept­able to ev­ery­one for Bri­tain to break in­ter­na­tional law and un­der­mine trust. Why the dou­ble stan­dards?</p>
    <p>Like­wise, Myan­mar should fol­low the lead of the US by not en­ter­tain­ing any in­ves­ti­ga­tions by ICC rep­re­sen­ta­tives into the coun­try. If US sol­diers can­not be brought to task for their ac­tions in Afghanista­n, why the dif­fer­ent treat­ment for Myan­mar sol­diers, who are ac­cused of com­mit­ting atroc­i­ties against the Ro­hingya?</p>
