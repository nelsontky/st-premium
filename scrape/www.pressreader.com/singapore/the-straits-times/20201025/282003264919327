    <p>• A man who sup­plied the weapons that were used by a cou­ple to kill 14 peo­ple in San Bernardino, Cal­i­for­nia, in 2015 has been sen­tenced to 20 years in fed­eral prison.</p>
    <p>En­rique Mar­quez Jr, 28, pleaded guilty in 2017 to pro­vid­ing the two as­sault ri­fles used by his friend Syed Rizwan Fa­rook and Fa­rook’s wife Tash­feen Ma­lik, in the at­tack at a hol­i­day party on Dec 2, 2015, with Fa­rook’s co-work­ers at a so­cial ser­vices cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Mar­quez also pleaded guilty to plot­ting two un­re­alised ter­ror­ist at­tacks in Cal­i­for­nia in 2011 and 2012.</p>
    <p>In plead­ing guilty, Mar­quez had ac­knowl­edged mak­ing false state­ments in con­nec­tion with his role as a “straw buyer” of the ri­fles, fed­eral pros­e­cu­tors said.</p>
    <p>Fa­rook and Ma­lik were killed in a shootout with the au­thor­i­ties hours af­ter the mas­sacre, which was the worst ter­ror­ist at­tack on Amer­i­can soil since Sept 11, 2001. Mar­quez, of River­side, Cal­i­for­nia, did not par­tic­i­pate in the shoot­ing, which also in­jured more than 20 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have called the shoot­ing an at­tack in­spired by the Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) mil­i­tants, and have pointed out that Ma­lik pledged al­le­giance to ISIS on Face­book on the day of the shoot­ing.</p>
    <p>Fed­eral pros­e­cu­tors said Mar­quez had ad­mit­ted in a plea agree­ment and in open court that he had also plot­ted with Fa­rook in 2011 and 2012 to at­tack River­side City Col­lege and a Cal­i­for­nia free­way.</p>
    <p>Those at­tacks were never car­ried out, but Mar­quez had dis­cussed with Fa­rook about us­ing ra­dio­con­trolled im­pro­vised ex­plo­sive de­vices for the at­tacks and bought Christ­mas tree light bulbs and a con­tainer of smoke­less pow­der to use in the de­vices, fed­eral pros­e­cu­tors said.</p>
    <p>In court last Fri­day, rel­a­tives of the vic­tims asked Judge Je­sus Ber­nal of the US District Court in Cen­tral Cal­i­for­nia to im­pose a lengthy sen­tence.</p>
    <p>“He’s a ter­ror­ist, your hon­our,” said Mr Gre­gory Clay­born, whose daugh­ter Sierra was killed. “And if you let him out, he’s go­ing to do it again.”</p>
