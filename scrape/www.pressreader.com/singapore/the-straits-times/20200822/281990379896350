    <p>The gov­ern­ments of Eng­land and Scot­land have fed the hopes and dreams of stu­dents into a paper shred­der, yanked out the tat­ters and handed them to uni­ver­sity ad­min­is­tra­tors with in­struc­tions to tape ev­ery­thing back to­gether.</p>
    <p>The fi­asco of al­go­rith­mi­cally as­signed exam grades is a night­mare for stu­dents, a huge em­bar­rass­ment for those in charge and should be a cau­tion­ary tale for the rest of the world. With all too many classes can­celled in re­cent months, here, at least, is a teach­able mo­ment, with lessons that go far be­yond ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>To sum­marise the train wreck: With schools closed and ex­ams can­celled, but grades needed to as­sign places at uni­ver­sity, stu­dents were promised that re­sults would be forth­com­ing. The fi­nal grades were as­signed by a data-driven view of each school’s his­tor­i­cal record. No stu­dent, no mat­ter how out­stand­ing, would be awarded top marks if the al­go­rithm con­cluded that her or his school was not a top-grade-sort-of-place. Count­less in­di­vid­ual in­jus­tices re­sulted.</p>
    <p>To add in­sult, stu­dents sit­ting niche sub­jects in small classes were spared the harsh dis­ci­pline of the al­go­rithm. Be­cause pri­vate schools ben­e­fited dis­pro­por­tion­ately from this se­lec­tive in­dul­gence, it looked as though a govern­ment full of over-priv­i­leged dimwits was us­ing an al­go­rithm to favour the over-priv­i­leged dimwits of the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>The U-turn part of the al­go­sham­bles was to wait un­til uni­ver­si­ties had re­as­signed their of­fers and only then can­cel the down­grades in favour of the orig­i­nal school pre­dic­tions, which were sig­nif­i­cantly higher.</p>
    <p>With many stu­dents sud­denly en­ti­tled to uni­ver­sity places that no longer ex­isted, the en­tire rolling dump­ster fire has now been pushed to uni­ver­sity ad­mis­sions of­fices.</p>
    <p>The in­jus­tice and the in­com­pe­tence here are pal­pa­ble enough. But there is a deeper point about the in­tox­i­cat­ing charm of al­go­rithms. In March, when the govern­ment faced ag­o­nis­ing choices about schools and ex­ams, the al­go­rithm promised fast, ef­fec­tive pain re­lief through the mir­a­cle of mod­ern tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>“When faced with a dif­fi­cult ques­tion, we of­ten an­swer an eas­ier one in­stead, usu­ally with­out notic­ing the sub­sti­tu­tion,” writes psy­chol­o­gist Daniel Kah­ne­man, in Think­ing, Fast And Slow.</p>
    <p>The dif­fi­cult ques­tion here was: Could we give stu­dents the grades they would have earned in the ex­ams? The eas­ier sub­sti­tute was: Could we make the over­all pat­tern of exam re­sults this year look the same as usual?</p>
    <p>That’s not hard. An al­go­rithm could mimic any his­tor­i­cal pat­tern you like – or en­sure equality</p>
    <p>(within the lim­its of arith­metic) based on gen­der or race. But note the sub­sti­tu­tion of the easy ques­tion for hard. It is im­pos­si­ble to give stu­dents the right grades for ex­ams they never sat – one would have to be in­fat­u­ated with al­go­rith­mic mir­a­cles not to re­alise that.</p>
    <p>But in­fat­u­a­tion with al­go­rith­mic mir­a­cles is not new. One of the first com­puter dat­ing ser­vices was called Op­er­a­tion Match. In the mid-1960s, it promised that the com­puter would “sci­en­tif­i­cally find the right date for you”. In fact it mostly matched peo­ple who lived near each other.</p>
    <p>An al­go­rithm might try to pre­dict ro­man­tic com­pat­i­bil­ity, but a wise cou­ple would not marry on that ba­sis with­out meet­ing. An al­go­rithm might try to pre­dict who will com­mit crime, and we might fo­cus sup­port on that ba­sis. But I hope we will never dare to jail peo­ple for al­go­rith­mi­cally pre­dicted pre-crimes.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther should we make the life-chang­ing de­ci­sion to deny a uni­ver­sity place for the pre-crime of pre­sump­tively miss­ing a grade in a hy­po­thet­i­cal exam. Per­haps the least bad op­tion this year was to fo­cus on max­imis­ing ac­cess to jobs, ap­pren­tice­ships and higher ed­u­ca­tion, cram­ming more stu­dents into uni­ver­si­ties rather than play­ing the game of fan­tasy grades.</p>
    <p>Re­gard­less, we would all be in a bet­ter po­si­tion now if back in March the govern­ment had faced the truth rather than be­ing daz­zled by the sparkling prom­ise of the al­go­rithm.</p>
