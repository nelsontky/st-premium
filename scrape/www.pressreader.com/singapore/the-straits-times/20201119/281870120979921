    <p>WASH­ING­TON The United States yes­ter­day an­nounced a sweep­ing new sanc­tions pack­age on Iran tar­get­ing a foun­da­tion con­trolled by Supreme Leader Ay­a­tol­lah Ali Khamenei as Wash­ing­ton ac­cused Te­heran of­fi­cials of hu­man rights abuses, a year after a deadly crack­down on anti-gov­ern­ment demon­stra­tors.</p>
    <p>The sanc­tions im­posed by the US Trea­sury Depart­ment mark the lat­est ac­tion to re­in­force the “max­i­mum pres­sure” cam­paign on Te­heran pur­sued by the ad­min­is­tra­tion of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and come just over two months be­fore he is due to leave of­fice after his loss in the Nov 3 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The depart­ment i mposed the sanc­tions on what it de­scribed as a key pa­tron­age net­work for the supreme leader.</p>
    <p>It said it black­listed the Bonyad Mostazafan, or the Foun­da­tion of the Op­pressed, which is con­trolled by Mr Khamenei, as well as 10 in­di­vid­u­als and 51 en­ti­ties that it said were as­so­ci­ated with the body.</p>
    <p>The char­i­ta­ble foun­da­tion – an eco­nomic, cul­tural, and so­cial wel­fare in­sti­tu­tion – has amassed vast amounts of wealth to the detri­ment of the rest of the Ira­nian econ­omy and con­trols hun­dreds of com­pa­nies and prop­er­ties con­fis­cated since the Is­lamic Rev­o­lu­tion in 1979.</p>
    <p>“Iran’s Supreme Leader uses Bonyad Mostazafan to re­ward his al­lies un­der the pre­tence of char­ity,” US Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Steven Mnuchin said in the state­ment.</p>
    <p>“The United States will con­tinue to tar­get key of­fi­cials and rev­enue gen­er­at­ing sources that en­able the regime’s on­go­ing re­pres­sion of its own peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>The Trea­sury Depart­ment also slapped sanc­tions on Ira­nian In­tel­li­gence Min­is­ter Mah­moud Alavi, ac­cus­ing his min­istry of play­ing a role i n se­ri­ous hu­man rights abuses against Ira­ni­ans, in­clud­ing dur­ing the protests in No­vem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>The crack­down a year ago may have been the blood­i­est re­pres­sion of pro­test­ers in Iran since the 1979 rev­o­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>Reuters re­ported last year that about 1,500 peo­ple were killed dur­ing less than two weeks of un­rest that started on Nov 15.</p>
    <p>The toll, pro­vided to Reuters by three Ira­nian in­te­rior min­istry of­fi­cials, in­cluded at least 17 teenagers and about 400 women as well as some mem­bers of the se­cu­rity forces and po­lice.</p>
    <p>Iran’s In­te­rior Min­istry has said that around 225 peo­ple were killed dur­ing the demon­stra­tions, which erupted after state me­dia an­nounced that gas prices would rise by as much as 200 per cent and the rev­enue would be used to help needy fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>The move to im­pose fresh sanc­tions comes as US Pres­i­dent-elect</p>
    <p>Joe Bi­den promised to re­in­state the nu­clear deal which the US con­cluded with Iran in 2015, but with­drew from un­der the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Iran’s for­eign min­is­ter had wel­comed the prospect of the US re­join­ing the nu­clear deal and said his coun­try is will­ing to re­turn to full com­pli­ance if Mr Bi­den lifts the crush­ing sanc­tions or­dered by Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>“The fact that Mr Bi­den wants to re­turn to the nu­clear deal is great,” Mr Mo­ham­mad Javad Zarif told the state-owned news­pa­per Iran in an in­ter­view pub­lished yes­ter­day. “We’re ready to hold talks over how the US can re-en­ter the nu­clear deal.”</p>
    <p>The Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion, he added, can lift sanc­tions on Iran with three ex­ec­u­tive or­ders, re­peat­ing an Ira­nian pre­req­ui­site to re­turn­ing to ne­go­ti­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Zarif’s com­ments were the most con­cil­ia­tory yet since Mr Bi­den was pro­claimed the win­ner of the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, the re­sults of which Mr Trump con­tin­ues to con­test.</p>
