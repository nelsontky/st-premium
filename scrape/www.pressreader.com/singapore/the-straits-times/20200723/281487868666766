    <p>Ac­tress Jo Tan is kiss­ing her hus­band Ed­ward Choy a lit­tle more th­ese days. And it is hap­pen­ing on cam­era.</p>
    <p>Their home has also be­come a film set for com­mer­cials and skits for vir­tual cor­po­rate din­ners, which they shoot to­gether.</p>
    <p>Un­der cur­rent pan­demic rules, only per­sons from the same house­hold are al­lowed to cross so­cial dis­tanc­ing bound­aries on film sets and the­atre stages. As a re­sult, Tan and Choy are called upon to per­form jobs that oth­ers can­not.</p>
    <p>They play an on-screen cou­ple in an up­com­ing Me­di­a­corp se­ries.</p>
    <p>Tan, 37, tells The Straits Times: “I was ap­proached to do the se­ries and they wanted to know if my hus­band was avail­able be­cause hand­hold­ing and kiss­ing were in­volved.”</p>
    <p>While they count them­selves for­tu­nate to have an edge in hir­ing, they re­main less busy than be­fore be­cause the film, tele­vi­sion and live per­for­mance in­dus­tries have been hard hit by the pan­demic. Their spare time is now spent learn­ing new skills, such as video-edit­ing so they can be more self-suf­fi­cient at pro­duc­ing con­tent with lim­ited re­sources.</p>
    <p>Choy, 40, is a free­lance ac­tor and lec­turer at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Tan, who is a singer as well, also ap­peared in videos for cor­po­ra­tions and a com­mer­cial for Cre­ative head­phones – all shot in her home. Her hus­band did the film­ing and edit­ing.</p>
    <p>When she works out­side, Tan has to fol­low safety mea­sures laid out for film and the­atre pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>At 7.30pm tonight, she will ap­pear in a live stream of a play that she wrote. Staged by T:>Works and di­rected by Jas­mine Ng, King (R18, bit.ly/2OMkMmM) is a one-woman drama-com­edy about an of­fice worker com­ing to terms with a new iden­tity.</p>
    <p>For the re­hearsals and per­for­mance, Tan and the crew have to ob­serve rules that in­clude lim­its on the num­ber of peo­ple on lo­ca­tion (from 10 to 30, de­pend­ing on the kind of pro­duc­tion) and who do not have to wear a mask at the same time, 1m so­cial dis­tanc­ing (2m if live singing is in­volved), split teams, the use of re­mote video or con­fer­enc­ing, and the clean­ing and dis­in­fec­tion of equip­ment.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore ac­tor-di­rec­tor Jack Neo, 60, says the new pro­ce­dures will im­pact film-mak­ing here.</p>
    <p>“Lim­it­ing the head­count on set, safe dis­tanc­ing and en­sur­ing all guide­lines are ad­hered to will slow down the pro­duc­tion process,” he tells ST in an e-mail in­ter­view. For in­stance, he notes that staff have to be hired to deal with on­look­ers crowd­ing the mar­gins of a film set.</p>
    <p>He has taken up the role of chief ex­ec­u­tive of the newly formed pro­duc­tion house Asia Mo­men­tum Me­dia (AMM), a sub­sidiary of Hong Kong’s Asia Tele­vi­sion Hold­ings.</p>
    <p>“Cur­rent AMM projects are not af­fected at the mo­ment as we are fo­cus­ing our ef­forts on our AMM app for on­line con­tent and live stream­ing,” says the maker of hit movies such as the four Ah Boys To Men mil­i­tary come­dies (2012 to 2017). The app is ex­pected to launch soon.</p>
    <p>While he has not been mak­ing shows dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, he has made an in­spi­ra­tional music video (bit.ly/3jDdqQG) in which he sings about keep­ing safe dur­ing this pe­riod, us­ing a crew of three to four and main­tain­ing safety pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>But when the cam­eras start rolling again, men­tal and lo­gis­ti­cal ad­just­ments have to be made, he says.</p>
    <p>Film-maker Ng, who di­rects Tan in the live-streamed per­for­mance of King, says film and video projects be­gan drying up from Fe­bru­ary. Clients post­poned, then can­celled com­mer­cials and cor­po­rate videos as more Covid-19 cases were re­ported. Un­cer­tainty gripped the film in­dus­try as in­fec­tion rates went up – some crews can num­ber more than 30.</p>
    <p>When the cir­cuit breaker started on April 7, the film and tele­vi­sion in­dus­try was ef­fec­tively shut down. “Peo­ple were won­der­ing, ‘what hap­pens next?’” Ng, 47, says.</p>
    <p>In on­line town halls at­tended by about 2,000 prac­ti­tion­ers in the in­dus­try, they spoke of wor­ries such as how well they could be pro­tected from in­fec­tion while re­main­ing ef­fec­tive in their jobs.</p>
    <p>Ng is the co-founder and pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore As­so­ci­a­tion of Mo­tion Pic­ture Pro­fes­sion­als, which works for the bet­ter­ment of the i ndus­try and or­gan­ised the town halls.</p>
    <p>Since then, work­ing in con­sul­ta­tion with the in­dus­try, the au­thor­i­ties have de­fined rules that al­low crews to work while keep­ing safe.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, in phase two, which started on June 19, a house­hold can have up to five vis­i­tors a day. This al­lows for small film crews to go to homes to shoot.</p>
    <p>“Pro­duc­tion peo­ple al­ways have to think on our feet, so we just have to get cre­ative and adapt along with the changes,” Ng says.</p>
    <p>Film-maker Des­mond Tan, head of pro­duc­tion house atyp­i­cal­films, notes that the Covid-19 cri­sis has made pro­fes­sion­als like him look deeper into work­ing re­motely so that cast, crew and clients can safely col­lab­o­rate.</p>
    <p>The 45-year-old has in­vested in live-stream­ing technology so that those not on-site, such as clients, can view what his cam­eras are cap­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>It has been chal­leng­ing, though, he says. Clients, for ex­am­ple, have a lim­ited pic­ture of the go­ings-on, which makes it hard for them to un­der­stand the flow of the shoot.</p>
    <p>“They have no pe­riph­eral vi­sion, so they can’t see what’s about to hap­pen. Some­one has to walk them through the shot.”</p>
    <p>As for crew mem­bers, if he is shoot­ing in one room of an apart­ment, they will po­si­tion them­selves in other rooms or even in the lobby of the build­ing, and watch the ac­tion on their phones or mon­i­tors. Ev­ery­one is linked by wire­less com­mu­ni­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>He has heard of shoots with crews dis­persed across sev­eral coun­tries. The di­rec­tor was not even in the same coun­try as the ac­tors, he says.</p>
    <p>Free­lance film-maker Alvin Lee, 29, made the short film From Grace To Grit (bit.ly/2EaXq8l), which fol­lows a Sin­ga­pore Air­lines ste­wardess adapt­ing to hospi­tal work fol­low­ing the down­turn in the air­line in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The short, one of four in the Stronger To­gether se­ries com­mis­sioned by the Min­istry of Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion, has chalked up more than 144,000 views.</p>
    <p>There is a be­hind-the-scenes video (bit.ly/39fw­foc) ex­plain­ing how the four films were made with safety pro­to­cols in place.</p>
    <p>Lee con­ducted on­line au­di­tions, but dur­ing the three-day shoot in May, he would of­ten fall back on old habits, only to be re­minded the world is now a dif­fer­ent place.</p>
    <p>“I like to move close to the ac­tors to give di­rec­tion, cri­tiques or sup­port, but my as­sis­tant di­rec­tor would tell me, ‘hey, so­cial dis­tanc­ing, please.’”</p>
