    <p>As di­vi­sion roils the coun­try ahead of the United States pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, Ms Jus­tine Lee is out to “Make Amer­ica Din­ner Again” and foster un­der­stand­ing in the process.</p>
    <p>The cre­ator of the pri­vate Face­book group by that name faces the chal­lenge of keep­ing con­ver­sa­tion civil at a so­cial net­work crit­i­cised as a caul­dron of tox­i­c­ity.</p>
    <p>Make Amer­ica Din­ner Again, or Mada, was started when Ms Lee, who lives in New York’s Bronx bor­ough, and a friend were stunned by the out­come of the 2016 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion and be­gan hold­ing din­ner par­ties to bring to­gether peo­ple with op­pos­ing po­lit­i­cal view­points.</p>
    <p>The din­ners caught on. Af­ter the coro­n­avirus pan­demic struck and pre­vented face-to-face gath­er­ings, Mada went vir­tual with a Face­book group.</p>
    <p>The group has not shied away from hot-but­ton dis­cus­sion top­ics in­clud­ing race, po­lice bru­tal­ity and abor­tion.</p>
    <p>While Face­book re­lies on au­to­mated sys­tems and user re­ports to fil­ter out un­ac­cept­able vit­riol, groups have hu­man mod­er­a­tors who can re­ject posts or turn off com­ments if dis­cus­sions go off the rails. Rather than Face­book or its chief Mark Zucker­berg de­cid­ing what is ac­cept­able, groups out­line their own stan­dards.</p>
    <p>“It is clear that these are the norms that we’ve agreed to as a group, and if you don’t agree with them or you can’t ad­here to them, you’re out,” Ms Lee said. “I feel like the rest of the In­ter­net is just too big to be like that.”</p>
    <p>Mada has around 850 mem­bers and a dozen mod­er­a­tors – six of them po­lit­i­cally left-lean­ing and six right-lean­ing.</p>
    <p>Face­book – which with more than 2.7 bil­lion monthly users is the lead­ing so­cial net­work – has been try­ing to shake off its im­age as a dan­ger­ously sprawl­ing plat­form by em­pha­sis­ing pri­vate com­mu­ni­ca­tions and small groups.</p>
    <p>“As the world gets big­ger and more con­nected, we need that sense of in­ti­macy more than ever,” Mr Zucker­berg said, when an­nounc­ing a tac­ti­cal shift last year.</p>
    <p>“That’s why I be­lieve the fu­ture is pri­vate.”</p>
    <p>Face­book does not place ads in groups, but data col­lected in pub­lic groups is used to rec­om­mend con­tent and tar­get ads else­where on the plat­form.</p>
    <p>Num­ber of mem­bers that Make Amer­ica Din­ner Again (Mada), a pri­vate Face­book group, has</p>
    <p>Mada hosted a vir­tual watch party last week for the first US pres­i­den­tial de­bate be­tween Mr Don­ald Trump and Mr Joe Bi­den. Ms Lee helped mod­er­ate the party.</p>
    <p>“When things got a lit­tle bit tense, we in­vited peo­ple to use ‘gifts’ and emo­jis to lighten the mood a bit and ex­press what they were feel­ing rather than their words,” Ms Lee said.</p>
    <p>Even with flash­point top­ics, group con­ver­sa­tions of­ten ben­e­fit from mem­bers hav­ing bonded over chil­dren, pets, hob­bies and other shared in­ter­ests or ad­ver­si­ties, ac­cord­ing to Ms Lee.</p>
    <p>Af­ter see­ing the ram­pant anx­i­ety caused by Covid-19, Aus­tralian doc­tor Cather­ine Bar­rett launched The Kind­ness Pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The group, which fo­cuses par­tic­u­larly on acts of kind­ness be­tween gen­er­a­tions, has grown to more than 500,000 mem­bers.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple join our group to cre­ate a bet­ter world,” said Dr Bar­rett, with a draw­ing of a heart dec­o­rat­ing a re­frig­er­a­tor be­hind her dur­ing a video call. “That sounds lofty, but it’s re­ally where it comes from. Our group has a very low tol­er­ance for un­kind­ness.”</p>
    <p>Face­book just added soft­ware tools for group ad­min­is­tra­tors, such as au­to­mat­i­cally flag­ging spec­i­fied words or bar­ring mem­bers from post­ing un­til they have been in a group for awhile.</p>
    <p>Posts shared to spark group dis­cus­sions typ­i­cally must be pre-ap­proved by mod­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>“I don’t en­joy Face­book be­cause I think peo­ple have been re­ally neg­a­tive,” Dr Bar­rett said of the broader so­cial net­work. “I think peo­ple in our group ap­pre­ci­ate the fact it is not toxic.”</p>
    <p>Face­book last week said it is rais­ing the pro­file of mem­ber groups, hop­ing peo­ple with dif­fer­ent views will find com­mon ground there.</p>
    <p>“Groups are al­low­ing peo­ple to en­gage with very dif­fer­ent per­spec­tives and back­grounds,” said Ms Fidji Simo, head of Face­book App. “It’s some­thing we can use now more than ever.”</p>
    <p>But as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor of com­mu­ni­ca­tions Jen­nifer Gry­giel at Syra­cuse Univer­sity said she wor­ries that pro­mot­ing groups might fur­ther drown out the free press ahead of a cru­cial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“The tim­ing is so off,” Ms Gry­giel said. “This is risky.”</p>
