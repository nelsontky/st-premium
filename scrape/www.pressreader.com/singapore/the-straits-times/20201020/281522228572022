    <p>A spot­light il­lu­mi­nates a punch­ing bag. A young man steps up and starts punch­ing as a voiceover be­gins, telling his life story.</p>
    <p>He is one of six young men who live in Wham­poa rental flats, and their sto­ries speak of ad­ver­sity, men­tal ill­ness, fam­ily vi­o­lence and aca­demic chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>This work­shopped per­for­mance, Men With Pens, is an on­go­ing project by Be­yond So­cial Ser­vices, which reaches out to un­der­priv­i­leged com­mu­ni­ties. It was pre­sented at The Sub­sta­tion as part of its Sep­tFest fringe re­cently.</p>
    <p>A theatre work­shop is not the first ac­tiv­ity one as­so­ci­ates with so­cial ser­vices. But arts out­reach pro­grammes, rang­ing from drama work­shops to sto­ry­telling ses­sions, have been sprout­ing at the grass­roots level as com­mu­nity work­ers and artists recog­nise how the arts can help un­lock com­mu­ni­ca­tions with at-risk chil­dren and youth, as well as serve ther­a­peu­tic pur­poses.</p>
    <p>Com­mu­nity worker Mos­samad So­bikun Na­har, 21, who worked with vol­un­teers Yanni Chia and Sub­has Nair on Men With Pens, ob­serves: “A lot of boys go for coun­selling, but they find it hard to de­scribe their feel­ings. What I no­tice in the arts pro­grammes is that they help to ex­ter­nalise ‘messy’ thoughts.”</p>
    <p>Men With Pens par­tic­i­pant Ab­dul­lah Al Sahil, 16, says: “I was shy at first and, to be hon­est, I didn’t want to come. But all of my friends and Sobi, Yanni and Sub­has gave me the courage to join.</p>
    <p>“It turned out to be the best ex­pe­ri­ence, and we had fun to­gether as a fam­ily and l earnt a l ot of new things. We all left the ses­sion trust­ing one an­other more.”</p>
    <p>Arts prac­tice helps draw chil­dren and youth out of their shells, says Ms Saleemah Is­mail, 52, co-founder and ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of New Life Sto­ries, which works with in­car­cer­ated par­ents and their chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“The chil­dren are not ex­pres­sive ver­bally. Some of them are with­drawn and pre­fer ex­press­ing emo­tion through draw­ing,” she says.</p>
    <p>Ms Lin Shiyun, 38, an arts pro­ducer and cre­ative direc­tor of com­mu­nity arts group 3Pump­kins, which runs the Tak Takut Kids Club in Boon Lay Drive, adds that lan­guage flu­ency can be an­other bar­rier to ex­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>Adults and coun­sel­lors also use art as a way of un­der­stand­ing the chil­dren’s men­tal states and emo­tional needs.</p>
    <p>Ms Saleemah cites the ex­am­ple of a young boy, who lived with his 24-year-old brother from one to five years old be­cause his fa­ther was in pri­son and his mother was ab­sent.</p>
    <p>The older brother was a fan of zom­bie movies and vi­o­lent first­per­son shooter games. The child’s draw­ings were “very dark, with blood splat­ters and peo­ple be­ing stabbed”, she re­calls.</p>
    <p>“We could an­a­lyse through his draw­ings that vi­o­lence has been nor­malised in his life. His nar­ra­tive is ‘ you have to kill these peo­ple be­fore they can hurt you’.”</p>
    <p>A New Life coun­sel­lor worked in­ten­sively with the child for a year and his draw­ings re­flected a grad­ual change in per­spec­tive. “His draw­ings now have him hold­ing hands with his fa­ther, who is home with him, and with his fa­ther and brother in the park,” she says.</p>
    <p>While so­cial en­ter­prises like Be­yond and New Life fo­cus on arts out­reach in Sin­ga­pore, the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Foun­da­tion’s Arts For Good ini­tia­tive is sup­port­ing arts out­reach pro­grammes that cross na­tional bor­ders.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans Teng Zi Ying, 27, and Re­bekah Lin, 34, came up with ArtSEA, a dig­i­tal re­source and train­ing pack fo­cus­ing on South-east Asian artists, which helps com­mu­nity work­ers and arts ed­u­ca­tors in un­der-re­sourced com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>They tar­geted five com­mu­ni­ties in South-east Asia, but ended up work­ing with 10 across Cam­bo­dia, In­done­sia, Malaysia and the Philip­pines be­cause of de­mand.</p>
    <p>The idea, says Ms Lin, is to equip com­mu­nity work­ers and sup­port ed­u­ca­tors so that they, in turn, can help the chil­dren in their com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>She says: “We pro­vide and struc­ture our work­shops and ma­te­ri­als in a way where even if they can­not have ac­cess to the In­ter­net and print­ing, when they go back and teach the other peo­ple, the com­mu­ni­ties that they work with, we are able to trans­late it.</p>
    <p>“There’s a lot of em­pha­sis on mak­ing arts an ac­ces­si­ble ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>I was shy at first and, to be hon­est, I didn’t want to come... It turned out to be the best ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>AB­DUL­LAH AL SAHIL, 16, on his par­tic­i­pa­tion in Men With Pens</p>
    <p>The duo ac­knowl­edge that i n Maslow’s hi­er­ar­chy of needs, the arts is nowhere near the top.</p>
    <p>But Ms Teng says work­ing with pris­on­ers in Lon­don, where she stud­ied ap­plied arts, gave her “a jolt” in un­der­stand­ing the im­por­tance of arts in com­mu­ni­ties where there are other ur­gent needs.</p>
    <p>“The arts feeds emo­tional, men­tal and psy­cho­log­i­cal needs in ways that other things strug­gle to,” she says.</p>
    <p>The pris­on­ers she worked with, for ex­am­ple, used theatre-mak­ing to con­nect with their chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Ms Teng adds: “Arts gen­er­ates hope. With com­mu­ni­ties that are un­der­served or vul­ner­a­ble, hope is very pow­er­ful be­cause it helps them break out. It helps them dream and al­lows this space for them to imag­ine, and reimag­ine, a dif­fer­ent life.”</p>
    <p>She points out that stud­ies have shown that the risk of re-of­fend­ing in pris­on­ers with strong fam­ily ties drops by more than 90 per cent.</p>
    <p>These com­mu­nity work­ers are pas­sion­ate ad­vo­cates of the arts, but they ac­knowl­edge that it is of­ten hard to get the broader com­mu­nity to ap­pre­ci­ate the need for it when food, shel­ter and work seem to pose more im­me­di­ate con­cerns.</p>
    <p>Ms Lin Shiyun used her sav­ings to rent a space for Tak Takut Kids Club last year be­cause she saw a need for such a space in the neigh­bour­hood where she lives.</p>
    <p>“I have to con­vince fun­ders be­cause they have not seen it be­fore. So I thought I’ll use my own money first.”</p>
    <p>The club is stocked with art sup­plies and games. 3Pump­kins’ “per­ma­nent free­lancers” such as Mr Fariz Na­jid run the place, con­duct­ing arts and craft work­shops, and sto­ry­telling and read­ing ses­sions.</p>
    <p>Ms Lin says: “We open from 5 to 9pm to re­ally sup­port the chil­dren whose par­ents have to be at shift work and there’s no adult su­per­vi­sion.”</p>
    <p>It is ev­i­dent that the staff have built bonds with the chil­dren, one of whom is wait­ing im­pa­tiently out­side the doors from 4.40pm on a re­cent week­day.</p>
    <p>In between pa­tiently reit­er­at­ing the rules and try­ing to get the Pri­mary 3 pupil to read the time on a clock, Mr Fariz ex­plains: “We set some rules to get them used to rou­tines.”</p>
    <p>The staff un­der­stand the chil­dren’s needs and tweak ac­tiv­i­ties to match, right down to bor­row­ing books from the li­brary to help them ad­dress spe­cific i ssues such as bul­ly­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Lin is hop­ing to get more com­mu­nity part­ners on board, rang­ing from the Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion to fam­ily cen­tres so as to ex­pand the club’s reach to do more good.</p>
    <p>She says: “We are very fo­cused on chil­dren. We can’t en­gage with the par­ents.”</p>
    <p>The out­reach work is very in­ten­sive, as Ms So­bikun says. She cred­its the suc­cess of Men With Pens to Mr Chia and Mr Nair, who com­mit­ted to weekly meet­ings and took a non-judg­men­tal ap­proach to lis­ten­ing. “It’s a very in­vested vol­un­teer ex­pe­ri­ence. No mat­ter what, they al­ways show up. They have been very com­mit­ted with the boys.”</p>
    <p>Such pro­gres­sive male vol­un­teers will be key in the fu­ture, she says, as Be­yond is hop­ing to repli­cate the ex­pe­ri­ence in other neigh­bour­hoods.</p>
    <p>While so­ci­ety at large may think these arts in­ter­ven­tions are friv­o­lous, the gen­eral con­sen­sus of the com­mu­nity work­ers is that such out­reach is crit­i­cal.</p>
    <p>New Life Sto­ries’ cur­rent project is its Close The Gap cam­paign, which aims to raise $15,000 for a cre­ative ac­tiv­ity pack for kids. Based on Ming Tan’s chil­dren’s book Near And Far, the pack will in­clude a plant grow­ing kit, a draw­ing block and colour pen­cil set and an oca­rina.</p>
    <p>While these may seem like high­cost items, Ms Saleemah says: “Su­per­fi­cially, it looks like a high­bud­get, high-care cost. But in fact, it isn’t a high cost be­cause what­ever in­vest­ment we make now in them as chil­dren is go­ing to save the state a lot more fi­nan­cial re­sources when they are adults and there was no in­ter­ven­tion through­out their child­hood and youth.”</p>
    <p>While the or­gan­i­sa­tion is not driven by such con­sid­er­a­tions of fi­nan­cial re­turns on in­vest­ment, she is a firm be­liever in the case for pre­ven­tive in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>“Qual­ity early child­hood now will re­sult in less so­cial costs in the fu­ture.”</p>
