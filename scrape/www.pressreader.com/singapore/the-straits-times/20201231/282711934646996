    <p>The French fash­ion de­signer died at age 98 on Tues­day. No cause was given</p>
    <p>• Five ways in which he was ahead of the fash­ion curve</p>
    <p>• In­dus­try vet­er­ans here talk about his legacy</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>Li­cens­ing pi­o­neer</p>
    <p>“Fash­ion is not enough,” French fash­ion de­signer Pierre Cardin once told Eu­ge­nia Shep­pard, the Amer­i­can news­pa­per colum­nist and fash­ion critic. “I don’t want to be just a de­signer.”</p>
    <p>He dressed the fa­mous – artists, po­lit­i­cal lu­mi­nar­ies, tastemak­ers and mem­bers of the haute bour­geoisie – but he was also a li­cens­ing pi­o­neer, a mer­chant to the gen­eral public with his name on a cor­nu­copia of prod­ucts. There were bub­ble dresses and avi­a­tor jump­suits, fra­grances and au­to­mo­biles, ash­trays and even pickle jars.</p>
    <p>Cardin, who died aged 98 on Tues­day in a hospi­tal just out­side of Paris, turned France’s fash­ion es­tab­lish­ment on its head, re­pro­duc­ing fash­ion for mass, ready-to-wear con­sump­tion and deal­ing a blow to the elitism that had gov­erned the Parisian cou­ture.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>Avant-garde de­signer</p>
    <p>In a ca­reer of more than three-quar­ters of a century, Cardin re­mained a fu­tur­ist.</p>
    <p>He for­sook his hard-edge aes­thetic for a time in the 1970s, in­cor­po­rat­ing draped fab­rics, pleat­ing, quilt­ing and asym­met­ri­cal col­lars and hems into his de­signs. His cou­ture col­lec­tion of 1986 fea­tured en­tire dresses made from bil­low­ing scarves.</p>
    <p>As the space age dawned, he dressed men, and women, in space­suits. In 1969, the United States’ Na­tional Aero­nau­tics and Space Ad­min­is­tra­tion (Nasa) com­mis­sioned him to cre­ate an in­ter­pre­ta­tion of a space­suit, a sig­nal in­spi­ra­tion in his later work.</p>
    <p>“The dresses I pre­fer,” he said at the time, “are those I in­vent for a life that does not yet ex­ist.”</p>
    <p>His de­signs were in­flu­enced by geo­met­ric shapes, of­ten ren­dered in fab­rics like sil­ver foil, pa­per and brightly coloured vinyl.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>Re­lent­less trend­set­ter</p>
    <p>His first col­lec­tion for the House of Cardin, es­tab­lished in 1950, fea­tured suits and coats mod­elled in heavy­weight wool with em­phatic de­tails and the geo­met­ric shapes and cutouts that were to be­come hall­marks of his col­lec­tions.</p>
    <p>His men’s ready-to-wear de­signs, in­tro­duced in 1960, were de­cid­edly more faith­ful to the body’s out­lines. Built on nar­row shoul­ders, high arm­holes and a fit­ted waist, they were stream­lined and some­what se­vere – dis­pens­ing in some cases with tra­di­tional col­lars in favour of the sim­ple banded Nehru, a name­sake adap­ta­tion of the style worn by the In­dian prime min­is­ter. Those suits were slow to catch on in the</p>
    <p>United States – un­til the Bea­tles ap­peared in knock­off ver­sions on the Ed Sul­li­van tele­vi­sion show in 1966. Nehru-ma­nia en­sued.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>Global ex­pan­sion­ist</p>
    <p>Cardin had laid the foun­da­tions for a global em­pire by the late 1950s, tak­ing his de­signs to Moscow, Tokyo and Bei­jing. He rel­ished his role as the over­seer of a realm that en­com­passed cloth­ing ac­ces­sories, fur­ni­ture, house­hold prod­ucts and fra­grances sold through some 800 li­censees in more than 140 coun­tries on five con­ti­nents.</p>
    <p>“I wash with my own soap,” he once boasted. “I wear my own per­fume, go to bed with my own sheets, have my own food prod­ucts. I live on me.”</p>
    <p>In 1981 he bought Maxim’s, once the world’s most fa­mous restau­rant, a land­mark of the belle epoque on the Rue Royale in Paris. Two years later, as part of an in­ter­na­tional ex­pan­sion, Maxim’s opened its first branch in Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>En­dur­ing in­flu­encer</p>
    <p>Cardin, who was a men­tor to de­sign­ers such as Jean Paul Gaultier, was ac­tive in fash­ion cir­cles un­til the last, still tak­ing young de­sign­ers un­der his wing, at­tend­ing par­ties and events and reg­u­larly vis­it­ing his Paris of­fice by Jaguar.</p>
    <p>“Thank you Mr Cardin for open­ing (for) me the doors to fash­ion and for mak­ing my dream pos­si­ble,” Gaultier wrote on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>Cardin lived to see his fash­ions reap­praised. His col­lec­tions served as the in­spi­ra­tion for de­sign­ers like Gareth Pugh, Si­mon Porte Jac­que­mus and, to some de­gree, Karl Lager­feld at Chanel.</p>
    <p>That he re­mained a force in the 21st century was at­tested to by Lady Gaga, who once wore one of his metal­lic chain­mail cre­ations on the con­cert stage.</p>
