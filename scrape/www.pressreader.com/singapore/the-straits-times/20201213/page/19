Source: MILIEU INSIGHT SUNDAY TIMES GRAPHICS RETAIL 1. To understand the scale of the problem, 1,000 people were polled on what they know about food production, consumptio­n and disposal here. 2. There is something fishy going on if, on a global scale, about one-third of all edible food, or about 1.3 billion tonnes, is wasted every year. 3. Volunteers regularly rescue vegetables and fruits discarded at
Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre for aesthetic reasons or because of oversupply. 4. Four years ago, France became the first country to ban supermarke­ts from throwing away edible food. How far behind are Singapore stores? 5. How much of the food in the family fridge ends up in the bin? Changing consumers' spending patterns can turn the tide on food waste. 6.
