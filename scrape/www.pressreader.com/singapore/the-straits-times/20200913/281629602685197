    <p>UN­WEL­COME MOVE</p>
    <p>Jakarta res­i­dents are de­spon­dent, an­gry, anx­ious and pes­simistic about the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>This fol­lows the an­nounce­ment that the city of more 10 mil­lion will have to en­dure tighter re­stric­tions for the sec­ond time from to­mor­row as Covid-19 cases rise in­ex­orably.</p>
    <p>En­ter­tain­ment venues will be shut, restau­rants and cafes will of­fer only de­liv­er­ies and take­aways, and staff in non-es­sen­tial sec­tors will work from home.</p>
    <p>When re­stric­tions – bet­ter known here by the lo­cal acro­nym PSBB – were first im­posed on April 10, the ini­tial pub­lic re­ac­tion was that of fear of get­ting in­fected.</p>
    <p>But not so this time around. Many, in fact, were hop­ing that Jakarta Gov­er­nor Anies Baswedan would call off the mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Fish­cake soup seller Okky Satria, 27, told The Sun­day Times: “I feel like a ping-pong ball, bounc­ing back and forth.”</p>
    <p>“Why must we go through this again? Peo­ple in other coun­tries never had to. When the gov­ern­ment lifted re­stric­tions, they should be for good,” he said.</p>
    <p>Then he got an­gry – mostly at those who ig­nored safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures as well as at the gov­ern­ment for not en­forc­ing dis­ci­pline and com­ing down hard on rule break­ers.</p>
    <p>“I hate peo­ple who do not wear masks. Frankly, I have de­clined to serve any­one with­out a mask. They are the big­gest cul­prits,” said Mr Okky, who is now ex­pect­ing business to nose­dive.</p>
    <p>He said his daily tak­ings started pick­ing up only two weeks ago, reach­ing five mil­lion ru­piah (S$460) on week­ends. This was only half the amount he used to make be­fore the pan­demic gripped the city in March.</p>
    <p>“I’m just so dis­ap­pointed now. The gov­ern­ment should have been stricter,” he said in res­ig­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Okky’s sen­ti­ments echo across the city.</p>
    <p>Jakarta be­gan to re­lax re­stric­tions on June 4, but still main­tained social dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Most res­i­dents, per­haps grudg­ingly, now ac­cept the need to re­in­state tougher mea­sures, but the impact on liveli­hoods is hard to swal­low.</p>
    <p>On Fri­day, two days af­ter an­nounc­ing the fresh re­stric­tions, Mr Anies posted on Face­book: “Please pre­pare well.”</p>
    <p>“This is the time for us to unite and work to­gether to fight this virus,” he added.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia has recorded 214,746 con­firmed Covid-19 cases, of which 52,840 were from Jakarta. The num­ber of deaths to­talled 8,650 na­tion­wide with 1,386 re­ported in Jakarta alone as of yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Anies was forced to re­in­state tough mea­sures af­ter the spike in cases put a mas­sive strain on Jakarta hos­pi­tals and its health­care work­ers.</p>
    <p>The cri­sis has ren­dered mil­lions of In­done­sians job­less, and an­a­lysts have warned of a sharp rise in the ranks of the poor. In­evitably, South-east Asia’s largest econ­omy of 270 mil­lion – like many oth­ers around the world – will suf­fer its first re­ces­sion in more than two decades.</p>
    <p>In­for­mal work­ers and the ur­ban poor have borne the brunt of the eco­nomic fall­out from the pan­demic, and many are be­lieved to have left Jakarta in re­cent days to re­turn to their vil­lages.</p>
    <p>Mr Muham­mad Rusli, 47, who runs a mo­tor­cy­cle steam wash shop in South Jakarta, said his neigh­bour has re­turned to his vil­lage in Subang, in West Java prov­ince.</p>
    <p>“He has no choice as he will have zero in­come. At least back in his kam­pung, he can sur­vive as his par­ents and other rel­a­tives will help him.”</p>
    <p>Mr Rusli is al­ready an­tic­i­pat­ing a cat-and-mouse game with the au­thor­i­ties from to­mor­row be­cause he ex­pects to con­tinue op­er­at­ing his business de­spite the re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>“When they come, I will close my shop. When they leave, I will re­open. They don’t have the right to tell me to stop earn­ing money,” he said in frus­tra­tion, adding that he had three chil­dren to feed.</p>
    <p>He said: “Why worry about the coro­n­avirus? Death and dis­eases are God’s will. Any­one, even the gov­ern­ment, should not in­ter­vene, oth­er­wise it would be a sin.”</p>
    <p>Road­side ven­dor Her­man, who sells hair ac­ces­sories from a push­cart, also said he would “con­tinue to roam the streets”.</p>
    <p>“I’m only wor­ried about hav­ing fewer cus­tomers,” he said.</p>
    <p>Un­der­stand­ably, most peo­ple are wor­ried about bread-and-but­ter is­sues.</p>
    <p>Mr Ha­jo­ran Sire­gar, 49, who rents out dor­mi­tory rooms to of­fice work­ers in the Jakarta business dis­trict, said only half of his prop­erty is cur­rently oc­cu­pied.</p>
    <p>“We used to be full house. Some</p>
    <p>I feel like a ping-pong ball, bounc­ing back and forth... Why must we go through this again? Peo­ple in other coun­tries never had to. When the gov­ern­ment lifted re­stric­tions, they should be for good.</p>
    <p>MR OKKY SATRIA, a fish­cake soup seller.</p>
    <p>DE­FY­ING THE AU­THOR­I­TIES</p>
    <p>When they come, I will close my shop. When they leave, I will re­open. They don’t have the right to tell me to stop earn­ing money.</p>
    <p>MR MUHAM­MAD RUSLI, who runs a mo­tor­cy­cle steam wash shop.</p>
    <p>ANX­IOUS FOR FAM­ILY</p>
    <p>I’m not wor­ried about Jakarta run­ning out of food but I’m anx­ious about whether I can af­ford to put that food on the ta­ble for my fam­ily.</p>
    <p>AGUS, who was out shop­ping.</p>
    <p>of them left be­cause their of­fice de­cided to let ev­ery­one work from home un­til the year end,” he said.</p>
    <p>A Sun­day Times check with mosques, su­per­mar­kets and wet</p>
    <p>mar­kets found it was business as usual at most places. Un­like in April, there was no sign of panic. Five months ago, har­ried shop­pers could be seen clear­ing the shelves as they</p>
    <p>stocked up on in­stant noo­dles, bot­tled wa­ter and other food sta­ples.</p>
    <p>“We have gone through a lock­down be­fore. I’m sure things will run nor­mally. The last time I</p>
    <p>stocked up on food, noth­ing hap­pened. Why panic now?” said a shop­per, who wanted to be known only as Agus.</p>
    <p>But he was less in­dif­fer­ent about</p>
    <p>the prospects for his shrimp rice business.</p>
    <p>“I’m not wor­ried about Jakarta run­ning out of food but I’m anx­ious about whether I can af­ford to put</p>
    <p>that food on the ta­ble for my fam­ily,” he said.</p>
