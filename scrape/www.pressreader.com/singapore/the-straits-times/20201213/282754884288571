    <p>All in­vestors have their weak points and of­ten think they are smarter than they ac­tu­ally are, so a steady tem­per­a­ment is crit­i­cal when putting your money on the line, says as­set man­age­ment ex­ec­u­tive Omar Slim.</p>
    <p>“We of­ten can be emo­tional, greedy, hasty, scared or de­ceived. That’s all nor­mal,” he says.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, suc­cess­ful in­vest­ing re­quires an aware­ness of those bi­ases and some con­trol over them.”</p>
    <p>Mr Slim, se­nior vice-pres­i­dent and a port­fo­lio man­ager at PineBridge In­vest­ments, ar­rived at his views af­ter a globe-trot­ting life­style that has given him a wealth of in­sight.</p>
    <p>He was born in Le­banon but has Cana­dian cit­i­zen­ship, and lived in France and the United States be­fore com­ing to Sin­ga­pore, where he has lived for eight years, some as a per­ma­nent res­i­dent.</p>
    <p>He holds a mas­ter’s de­gree in fi­nance from Bos­ton Col­lege and is a char­tered fi­nan­cial an­a­lyst.</p>
    <p>His role as lead port­fo­lio man­ager at PineBridge In­vest­ments in­volves in­vest­ing in the cor­po­rate, struc­tured and sovereign bond sec­tors as well as the cur­rency ex­change mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Be­fore j oin­ing the New York­head­quar­tered in­vest­ment man­ager in 2013, Mr Slim, 40, worked in var­i­ous roles at as­set man­ager State Street Global Ad­vi­sors and was a re­search an­a­lyst at bank­ing group BNP Paribas.</p>
    <p>His typ­i­cal day is hec­tic, re­volv­ing around stay­ing on top of mar­ket-im­pact­ing de­vel­op­ments such as eco­nomic re­leases, cor­po­rate an­nounce­ments and po­lit­i­cal de­vel­op­ments.</p>
    <p>“It is easy to get too im­mersed in all of this. How­ever, our real goal is to im­prove the lives of those who trust us with their in­vest­ments,” notes Mr Slim, who is sin­gle.</p>
    <p>“It is very ful­fill­ing when that hap­pens.”</p>
    <p>He sees money as “the ul­ti­mate fa­cil­i­ta­tor, whether you’re us­ing it to feel se­cure, to en­sure a dig­ni­fied and healthy life, to pro­vide the fu­ture one wishes for their loved ones, to give to causes one feels strongly about or gen­er­ally to live life the way one wants.</p>
    <p>“Money might not buy hap­pi­ness but it’s cer­tainly eas­ier to be happy with money than with­out it.”</p>
    <p>Q What’s in your per­sonal port­fo­lio? A My per­sonal port­fo­lio con­sists of liq­uid i nvest­ments like eq­uity, bond and gold ex­po­sure, as well as less liq­uid in­vest­ments like real es­tate.</p>
    <p>My in­vest­ments are mostly con­cen­trated in North Amer­ica and Asia, in­clud­ing Ja­pan, be­cause this is where I see the most op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Both the fixed in­come and eq­uity mar­kets present plenty of op­por­tu­ni­ties. For in­stance, there are plenty of smaller-cap Asian stocks that are un­der-an­a­lysed, es­pe­cially in tech and man­u­fac­tur­ing. These al­low in­vestors to ac­cess the re­gion’s rel­a­tive growth story and its in­creas­ing in­ter­con­nec­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>In Ja­pan, there are plenty of smaller-sized com­pa­nies with top­notch prod­ucts and ex­per­tise with plenty of cash. These can be un­cov­ered with proper re­search.</p>
    <p>Asian fixed in­come, par­tic­u­larly the US dol­lar-de­nom­i­nated seg­ment, has been of­fer­ing some of the best risk-ad­justed re­turns among all as­set classes and I think this will con­tinue to be the case for the fore­see­able fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Q De­scribe your in­vest­ing strat­egy.</p>
    <p>A With re­gard to my per­sonal style of in­vest­ing, I have con­trar­ian ten­den­cies, an ap­proach that has gen­er­ally served me well.</p>
    <p>I am more of­ten than not scep­ti­cal of con­sen­sus, par­tic­u­larly when it re­lates to macro strat­egy, which refers to the high level eco­nomic trends and their im­pact on cor­re­spond­ing mar­ket in­di­ca­tors.</p>
    <p>Some­times con­sen­sus is right. Some­times it is wrong. But it is al­ways worth ques­tion­ing.</p>
    <p>I am the lead man­ager for a num­ber of strate­gies that in­vest in the cor­po­rate credit mar­kets, the rates and cur­rency mar­kets. I spend a lot of time with the broader team analysing credit and eco­nomic trends as well as po­lit­i­cal de­vel­op­ments.</p>
    <p>Our job is re­ally to an­tic­i­pate those trends and act on them to the ben­e­fit of our in­vestors.</p>
    <p>As renowned eco­nomic John May­nard Keynes said, suc­cess­ful in­vest­ing is an­tic­i­pat­ing the an­tic­i­pa­tion of oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Q What else is in your fi­nan­cial plan?</p>
    <p>A My per­sonal fi­nan­cial plan is to se­cure my fu­ture and the fu­ture of my loved ones. There are also a num­ber of causes that I feel strongly about and sup­port.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, I sup­port the Sin­ga­pore Red Cross, which does great work both lo­cally and in­ter­na­tion­ally, with no­table ef­forts this year re­lat­ing to Covid-19 re­lief ini­tia­tives.</p>
    <p>I am also in­volved in some ini­tia­tives out­side of Sin­ga­pore, fo­cused pre­dom­i­nantly on ed­u­ca­tion for the un­der­priv­i­leged.</p>
    <p>This year, for ex­am­ple, I was ac­tively in­volved in a PineBridge cam­paign that sup­ported Be­yond So­cial Ser­vices, a Sin­ga­pore char­ity ded­i­cated to help­ing youth from less priv­i­leged back­grounds break away from the poverty cy­cle.</p>
    <p>My mother is a huge in­flu­ence on my in­volve­ment and in­ter­est in char­i­ta­ble ac­tiv­i­ties; help­ing those in need is some­thing she has al­ways been pas­sion­ate about.</p>
    <p>I am also an avid sup­porter of the arts, par­tic­u­larly mu­sic and the­atre. The Sin­ga­pore Sym­phony Or­ches­tra and the­atre com­pa­nies like Wild Rice are, in my view, ex­cel­lent.</p>
    <p>Q</p>
    <p>How are you plan­ning for re­tire­ment?</p>
    <p>A I love what I do, so I am not re­ally think­ing about re­tire­ment for the time be­ing. Ob­vi­ously, I plan for a pe­riod when I will ded­i­cate my time to ac­tiv­i­ties other than pro­fes­sional in­vest­ing.</p>
    <p>On that, I also think it’s good to live a lit­tle be­fore old age, so don’t wait for re­tire­ment to en­joy life!</p>
    <p>Q Home is now ... A</p>
    <p>Home is Sin­ga­pore, where I’ve lived for the past eight years. I live in a rented two-bed­room, 1,200 sq ft apart­ment in the Ma­rina Bay area.</p>
    <p>Q A</p>
    <p>I drive ...</p>
    <p>I don’t own a car in Sin­ga­pore. It’s pro­hib­i­tively ex­pen­sive to own cars here, and it’s not re­ally nec­es­sary given the ex­cel­lent pub­lic trans­port in­fra­struc­ture and size of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>I do, how­ever, like driv­ing and it is some­thing I would of­ten do when out of Sin­ga­pore in the preCovid-19 days.</p>
