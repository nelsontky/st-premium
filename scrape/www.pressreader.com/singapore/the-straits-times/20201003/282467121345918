    <p>PARIS • Top seed Si­mona Halep knew ex­actly what she had to do when she ex­acted bru­tal re­venge on Amer­i­can teenager Amanda Anisi­mova yes­ter­day with a 6-0, 6-1 vic­tory to move omi­nously into the last 16 of the French Open.</p>
    <p>Anisi­mova caused a huge up­set last year when she beat the Ro­ma­nian, then the de­fend­ing cham­pion, com­fort­ably in the quar­ter-fi­nals, but could not re­pro­duce that form as she re­ceived a 54-minute clay-court les­son yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Halep was in typ­i­cally miserly mood on Court Philippe Cha­trier, mak­ing only seven un­forced er­rors and wait­ing for her 19-year-old op­po­nent to make mis­takes, of which she made 32.</p>
    <p>“I learnt so many things from last year,” she told Eurosport.</p>
    <p>“So I just wanted to show my­self that I was able to win against her. Re­ally happy the way I played.</p>
    <p>“Even if the ball was re­ally heavy, I played very ag­gres­sive. I think last year, I stood too far back on the re­turn but to­day, I did well and the I think the plan was great for to­day.”</p>
    <p>It took her only 23 minutes to win the open­ing set in which she made ev­ery sin­gle ser­vice re­turn.</p>
    <p>The 29th-seeded Anisi­mova, who had dropped only four games in her first two matches, briefly threat­ened a re­vival at the start of the sec­ond set but Halep raced away to vic­tory.</p>
    <p>It ex­tended her ca­reer-best win­ning run to 17 matches and she will next meet an­other 19-year-old, Poland’s Iga Swiatek, for a place in the quar­ter-fi­nals.</p>
    <p>Halep, the 2018 French Open cham­pion and two-time run­ner up at Roland Gar­ros, dropped just one game when she played Swiatek here in the last 16 a year ago.</p>
    <p>“I played against her be­fore,” the 29-year-old said. “She’s hit­ting strong and flat. I have to stay fo­cused on my­self.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally want to win again.” Two-time quar­ter-fi­nal­ist Elina Svi­tolina also en­sured she will stick around for the sec­ond week in Paris with a 6-4, 7-5 win over Rus­sia’s Eka­te­rina Alexan­drova, the 27th seed.</p>
    <p>The Ukrainian is full of con­fi­dence af­ter cap­tur­ing her 15th ca­reer WTA ti­tle at Stras­bourg last week­end.</p>
    <p>“It’s al­ways re­ally nice to have an­other chance to go deep in the tour­na­ment,” she said. “It’s a lit­tle bit dif­fer­ent with­out the crowd, so you start to trea­sure ev­ery match and ev­ery Grand Slam you play.”</p>
    <p>In the men’s draw, third seed Do­minic Thiem was not at his best but still had enough fire­power to see off the chal­lenge of Nor­way’s Casper Ruud with a 6-4, 6-3, 6-1 win to march into the fourth round.</p>
    <p>The US Open cham­pion, who lost to Rafael Nadal in the last two fi­nals at Roland Gar­ros, strug­gled with his serve in the open­ing set and faced six break­points, but im­proved as the match pro­gressed un­der the closed roof.</p>
    <p>Fac­ing the 21-year-old Ruud for the first time, the Aus­trian broke the 28th seed’s serve six times and hit 32 win­ners to seal the match with a fifth ace on his sec­ond match­point.</p>
    <p>“I’m very happy. It was a great match, I didn’t do any mis­takes,” Thiem said in his court­side in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>“Casper is a re­ally great player, very at­trac­tive to play, I think there were many good ral­lies, it was a good match from both of us.</p>
    <p>“The con­di­tions are very nice to play un­der the roof, no wind, so the court is per­fect and ev­ery­thing is pre­pared for great matches like that.”</p>
