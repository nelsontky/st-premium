    <p>All gym­nasts are en­ti­tled to train with­out fear of phys­i­cal or psy­cho­log­i­cal abuse, the Gym­nas­tics Ethics Foun­da­tion’s (GEF) di­rec­tor Alex McLin re­it­er­ated to The Straits Times in a re­cent in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>The GEF is an in­de­pen­dent body set up by the In­ter­na­tional Gym­nas­tics Fed­er­a­tion (FIG) last year in the wake of the USA Gym­nas­tics scandal, which saw its former team doc­tor Larry Nas­sar j ailed af­ter plead­ing guilty to sex­u­ally abus­ing ath­letes un­der his care.</p>
    <p>McLin told ST via email: “Whilst the magnitude of the USA Gym­nas­tics scandal is ab­so­lutely stag­ger­ing, ev­ery sin­gle case of abuse is ter­ri­ble and un­ac­cept­able.</p>
    <p>“We see tes­ti­monies com­ing from across the globe and no two sit­u­a­tions are ex­actly alike. Ev­ery gym­nast, re­gard­less of the level, must be able to train in a safe en­vi­ron­ment, free of phys­i­cal or psy­cho­log­i­cal ha­rass­ment or abuse.”</p>
    <p>GEF has a hot­line and an email ad­dress on its web­site where “in­stances or threats of non-ac­ci­den­tal vi­o­lence, ha­rass­ment, abuse, and/or ne­glect may be re­ported”.</p>
    <p>McLin stressed the var­i­ous na­tional fed­er­a­tions world­wide also have a re­spon­si­bil­ity to im­ple­ment poli­cies and pro­ce­dures that pro­tect their ath­letes from ha­rass­ment and abuse. The GEF of­fers as­sis­tance to na­tional fed­er­a­tions that need help with this.</p>
    <p>If a na­tional fed­er­a­tion does not com­ply with FIG reg­u­la­tions, the GEF may open dis­ci­plinary pro­ceed­ings against it. This could re­sult in sanc­tions be­ing im­posed.</p>
    <p>Gym­nas­tics’ lead­ers have been go­ing all out to fix its toxic cul­ture in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>The many al­le­ga­tions of abuse prompted FIG pres­i­dent Mori­nari Watan­abe to la­bel the men­tal­ity of those coaches lord­ing over their charges as an an­ti­quated and dan­ger­ous way of coach­ing last month.</p>
    <p>The FIG also held a two-day vir­tual con­fer­ence last month to dis­cuss and erad­i­cate toxic prac­tices that have plagued the sport for years. It drew more than 800 rep­re­sen­ta­tives from about 80 fed­er­a­tions world­wide.</p>
    <p>Ath­letes, in­clud­ing Olympians Fabian Ham­buchen, Carolina Ro­driguez and Danu­sia Fran­cis, coaches and sports ad­min­is­tra­tors were among the par­tic­i­pants in the in­ter­ac­tive fo­rum, where they dis­cussed ways to bet­ter safe­guard gym­nasts’ wel­fare.</p>
