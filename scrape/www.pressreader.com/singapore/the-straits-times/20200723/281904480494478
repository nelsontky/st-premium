    <p>STOCK­HOLM • The No­bel Foun­da­tion, which man­ages the No­bel Prizes, has can­celled its tra­di­tional December ban­quet be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and said the award cer­e­monies would be held in “new forms”.</p>
    <p>This is the first time since 1956 that the lav­ish ban­quet has been can­celled, ac­cord­ing to the foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>The event tra­di­tion­ally marks the end of the so-called No­bel Week, when the year’s prize win­ners are in­vited to Swedish cap­i­tal Stock­holm for talks and the award cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>“The No­bel Week will not be as it usu­ally is due to the cur­rent pan­demic. This is a very spe­cial year when ev­ery­one needs to make sac­ri­fices and adapt to com­pletely new cir­cum­stances,” Dr Lars Heiken­sten, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the No­bel Foun­da­tion, said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>He added that the lau­re­ates and their work would be high­lighted in “dif­fer­ent ways”, hint­ing that prize win­ners would re­ceive their awards in their home coun­tries or at em­bassies.</p>
    <p>Tra­di­tion­ally, the prize win­ners join the Swedish royal family and some 1,300 guests for the ban­quet at Stock­holm’s City Hall after the award cer­e­mony – held on Dec 10, the an­niver­sary of the death of the prizes’ founder, dy­na­mite in­ven­tor and busi­ness­man Alfred No­bel.</p>
    <p>The win­ners, ex­cept Peace Prize lau­re­ates who are hon­oured i n Oslo, also usu­ally give speeches dur­ing the din­ner.</p>
    <p>Many of the events will be held un­der new ar­range­ments be­cause of the un­cer­tainty around l arge gath­er­ings and in­ter­na­tional travel, the foun­da­tion said.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment of the prizes (Medicine, Physics, Chem­istry, Lit­er­a­ture, Peace and Eco­nom­ics) would still be made be­tween Oct 5 and 12, the Foun­da­tion said.</p>
    <p>The No­bel Ban­quet was l ast can­celled in 1956 to avoid invit­ing the Soviet am­bas­sador be­cause of the re­pres­sion of the Hun­gar­ian Revo­lu­tion, Ms Re­becka Ox­el­strom, head of press at the No­bel Foun­da­tion, told Agence FrancePres­se.</p>
    <p>“An un­of­fi­cial din­ner was neverthele­ss or­gan­ised, without the am­bas­sador, in an­other room,” she said.</p>
    <p>The ban­quet was also can­celled dur­ing the two world wars and in 1907 and 1924.</p>
    <p>While no prizes were awarded dur­ing World War II, they were handed out dur­ing World War I – although the cer­e­monies were post­poned, No­bel ex­pert Gus­tav Kall­strand told AFP.</p>
    <p>“A cer­e­mony and din­ner, without roy­als, was held in the sum­mer of 1920 when they handed out the awards for pre­vi­ous years,” Dr Kall­strand said.</p>
