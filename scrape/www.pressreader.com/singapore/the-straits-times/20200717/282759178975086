    </section>

    <p>SWEATY HOT BOD: Wang Leehom is known for his good looks and physique. The Chi­nese-Amer­i­can singer-song­writer re­vealed on so­cial me­dia last year that he worked out six times a week for 18 months be­fore flaunt­ing his toned body on the cover of the July 2019 edi­tion of Men’s Health mag­a­zine.</p>
    <p>In the post, the 44-year-old even jok­ingly asked his wife Li Jin­glei, 34, if his physique was good enough to dis­tract her. He was re­fer­ring to a 2018 photo which showed her en­grossed in her mo­bile phone de­spite him bar­ing his up­per body.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple have two daugh­ters, aged six and three, and a son who turns two next month.</p>
    <p>The Man­dopop star, who held his con­cert in Sin­ga­pore in Jan­uary last year, has main­tained his physique. On Wed­nes­day, he posted a photo of him­self do­ing the sus­pended crunch, with the cap­tion “sus­pended oblique twists make the sweat drip” and the hash­tag #morn­ing­work­out.</p>
    <p>His In­sta­gram post has re­ceived more than 35,000 likes as of yes­ter­day af­ter­noon, with some fans say­ing that he looked like mar­tial arts su­per­star Bruce Lee in the photo.</p>
    <p>Even Tai­wanese pop star Jay Chou praised him for look­ing “so fit”. His com­ment led to a flurry of re­ac­tions, with fans urg­ing Chou, 41, to stop drink­ing bub­ble tea which he adores. Oth­ers urged him to hit the gym with Wang or with his good friend, singer-ac­tor Will Liu, a fit­ness buff also known for his physique.</p>
