    <p>ZHENGZHOU (China) • Bi­ol­ogy stu­dent Ma Jingjing wan­dered around the hall of a j ob fair in cen­tral China, among other young job seek­ers, hop­ing to find work in an econ­omy crushed by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ms Ma, 26, is one of al­most nine mil­lion peo­ple grad­u­at­ing and en­ter­ing the job mar­ket this year at a time of great un­cer­tainty, an is­sue that has the rul­ing Com­mu­nist Party wor­ried to the point that Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping has made it a pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>China re­ported 49 Covid-19 cases on the main­land for Satur­day, up from 45 cases a day ear­lier, the health com­mis­sion said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The world’s se­cond-largest econ­omy may have re­bounded sharply from a his­toric virus-in­duced con­trac­tion, but its young grad­u­ate job­less rate in June was more than three times that for ur­ban un­em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>Ms Ma was among hun­dreds of young faces stream­ing in and out of the job fair on a re­cent week­end in Zhengzhou, where em­ploy­ers in in­dus­tries rang­ing from real es­tate to man­u­fac­tur­ing were re­cruit­ing.</p>
    <p>Like many oth­ers, the as­pir­ing teacher is at a loss and won­der­ing if she should set­tle for any job or hold off work for fur­ther ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“I have ap­plied to seven or eight pri­vate schools, but only one has called me back for an in­ter­view,” she told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>“I have stud­ied for so many years and don’t want my fam­ily to pay for fur­ther train­ing. I am es­pe­cially wor­ried about my fi­nances.”</p>
    <p>Aware of the risk that mass un­em­ploy­ment can spark po­lit­i­cal un­rest – jeop­ar­dis­ing the party’s pledge of pros­per­ity in re­turn for un­ques­tioned po­lit­i­cal power – the gov­ern­ment has been mak­ing ef­forts to boost grad­u­ate em­ploy­ment via state-owned en­ter­prises (SOEs).</p>
    <p>But poorer op­por­tu­ni­ties this year are push­ing some into fur­ther stud­ies, less ideal jobs or other op­tions.</p>
    <p>Although China’s econ­omy ap­peared to make a strong come­back in the se­cond quar­ter – grow­ing 3.2 per cent year on year – an­a­lysts cau­tion that the re­bound may be over­es­ti­mated, with a gap re-emerg­ing be­tween na­tional fig­ures and higher-fre­quency data.</p>
    <p>Mr Louis Kuijs of Ox­ford Eco­nom­ics said there is no doubt China is re­cov­er­ing, but the mag­ni­tude would de­ter­mine if growth is “strong enough to re-ab­sorb some of the labour mar­ket prob­lems” that emerged this year, such as lay­offs.</p>
    <p>A gap in growth of a few per­cent­age points could lead to a dif­fer­ence of mil­lions of jobs cre­ated, he added.</p>
    <p>Although China’s ur­ban un­em­ploy­ment rate slipped to 5.7 per cent in June, 19.3 per cent of new grad­u­ates re­mained job­less, UOB econ­o­mists said in a re­port, adding that the labour mar­ket “con­tin­ued to face chal­lenges”.</p>
    <p>Top-level eco­nomic data has not nec­es­sar­ily meant bet­ter hir­ing on the ground.</p>
    <p>A 27-year-old with the sur­name Kang, who grad­u­ated in 2017, is back on the mar­ket af­ter his con­tract in the com­mu­ni­ca­tions in­dus­try in Bei­jing ended. He de­cided to re­turn to Zhengzhou, but has re­ceived only five call­backs af­ter send­ing out more than 30 re­sumes.</p>
    <p>“The virus outbreak has lim­ited travel and a lot of job fairs have been post­poned or can­celled,” he said. “I am ex­tremely anx­ious.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lu Yi­fan, 25, said the pan­demic had caused many overseas Chi­nese stu­dents like him to re­turn home sooner than planned, adding to the flood of job seek­ers.</p>
    <p>Guang­dong grad­u­ate Zhao Jingy­ing, 22, said: “For us (this year), get­ting a sin­gle job of­fer is a feat.”</p>
    <p>The cri­sis is also caus­ing prob­lems for em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Yang Chang­wei, man­ager of Deyou Real Es­tate, told Agence France-Presse that it was get­ting harder to hire sales staff based on com­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>He said: “It feels like job seek­ers’ mind­sets have shifted. In sales, you may or may not make deals, but with other jobs, there can be more sta­bil­ity in in­come.”</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials are ramp­ing up ef­forts to boost grad­u­ate em­ploy­ment, and Pre­mier Li Ke­qiang an­nounced that more than nine mil­lion new roles will be cre­ated this year.</p>
    <p>A State Coun­cil guide­line i n March said smaller firms that re­cruit grad­u­ates with con­tracts longer than a year will be given a sub­sidy, while SOEs will con­tin­u­ously ex­pand the scale of grad­u­ate­hir­ing this year and the next.</p>
    <p>The He­nan au­thor­i­ties, for one, said that at least half the re­cruit­ment po­si­tions at SOEs within the prov­ince should be re­served for this year’s grad­u­ates, while Nan­jing city in Jiangsu prov­ince set aside one bil­lion yuan (S$197 mil­lion) to pro­vide 100,000 in­tern­ships for strug­gling grad­u­ates, Xin­hua news agency re­ported.</p>
