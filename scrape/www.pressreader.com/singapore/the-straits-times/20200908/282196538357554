    <p>Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo is helped off court by Bucks team­mates but the East top seeds beat Mi­ami to cut the deficit to 3-1.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) Mil­wau­kee star Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo limped out of the Bucks’ 118-115 over­time vic­tory over the Mi­ami Heat on Sun­day, and it is not clear if he will be able to play when they con­tinue their bat­tle to stay alive in the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) play-offs.</p>
    <p>The reign­ing NBA Most Valu­able Player had rolled his right an­kle in the Bucks’ Game 3 loss to the Heat, which left the Eastern Con­fer­ence top seeds in an 0-3 hole in the be­stof-seven se­ries and fac­ing elim­i­na­tion on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>An­te­tok­oun­mpo, who played on and in­sisted the an­kle did not bother him on Fri­day, twisted it again in the sec­ond quar­ter on a drive to the rim against Mi­ami’s An­dre Iguo­dala.</p>
    <p>He was fouled and went down hard, but stayed in the game and shot two free throws, mak­ing one, be­fore limp­ing to the locker room.</p>
    <p>He left the arena in the NBA’s quar­an­tine bub­ble in Or­lando, Florida, wear­ing a pro­tec­tive boot on the af­fected leg. Bucks coach Mike Bu­den­holzer said he did not yet know if his star for­ward would be avail­able for Game 5 to­day.</p>
    <p>“As far as for Game 5, they’re eval­u­at­ing him now,” he said. “He’ll get treat­ment through the night, and we’ll just see how he does over the next 24 to 48 hours.”</p>
    <p>Bu­den­holzer said less than two hours be­fore Sun­day’s game that An­te­tok­oun­mpo was still test­ing the an­kle. But the Greek star looked un­hin­dered early on, scor­ing 19 points in 11 min­utes be­fore he was hurt again.</p>
    <p>Khris Mid­dle­ton scored a game­high 36 points and hit a pair of free throws with 2.2 sec­onds left in over­time as the Bucks staved off elim­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>The for­ward said one thought went through his mind late in the game. “Just keep fight­ing,” he said. “I saw what my team­mates did. We all fought.”</p>
    <p>In the West, LeBron James and An­thony Davis com­bined for 62 points and 21 re­bounds, and the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers needed to hold off the fourth-seeded Rock­ets’ sec­ond-half rally to win 117-109 to even their semi-fi­nals se­ries 1-1.</p>
    <p>James narrowly missed a triple­dou­ble, fin­ish­ing with 28 points, 11 re­bounds and nine as­sists.</p>
