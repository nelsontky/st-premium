    <p>ZURICH • Nick­named “The Body” and dubbed a “ma­chine” by his wife, Robert Le­wandowski has done what many thought im­pos­si­ble – rel­e­gat­ing su­per­stars Cris­tiano Ron­aldo and Lionel Messi to sup­port­ing roles at a foot­ball awards show.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, the Bay­ern Mu­nich striker was named The Best Fifa Men’s Player 2020, af­ter a tre­ble-win­ning sea­son capped by the club’s sixth Euro­pean Cup.</p>
    <p>Croa­tia and Real Madrid mid­fielder Luka Mo­dric, who won in 2018, is the only other player to have bro­ken Ron­aldo and Messi’s dom­i­na­tion – the pair have won five and six times re­spec­tively – since 2008.</p>
    <p>“He de­served it more than any­one else. He played the sea­son of his life,” said Bay­ern chair­man Karl-Heinz Rum­menigge of Le­wandowski, who fired i n 55 goals in all com­pe­ti­tions last term.</p>
    <p>The Poland for­ward has al­ready scored 18 goals in 17 games this term, hit­ting the net twice against Wolfs­burg on Wed­nes­day to pass the mile­stone of 250 Bun­desliga goals.</p>
    <p>The fact he has taken this long to win at Fifa’s The Best awards is down to the way he proved him­self in the knock­out stage of the Cham­pi­ons League last sea­son.</p>
    <p>De­spite hav­ing been the Bun­desliga’s top scorer for five of the last seven terms, he was get­ting a rep­u­ta­tion for chok­ing i n key games in Eu­rope. Up un­til Fe­bru­ary, the 32-year-old had failed to score in his pre­vi­ous seven matches in the knock­out phase.</p>
    <p>All that changed i n Bay­ern’s last-16, first-leg win over Chelsea, with Le­wandowski net­ting at Stamford Bridge and set­ting up Serge Gnabry’s two goals in the 3-0 win.</p>
    <p>When the re­turn leg was played six months later, Le­wandowski had a hand in all four goals – scor­ing twice and cre­at­ing two more – in the 4-1 win at the Al­lianz Arena.</p>
    <p>He fol­lowed that up by scor­ing in the his­toric 8-2 quar­ter-fi­nal rout of Barcelona – their worst de­feat in Eu­rope – and net­ted again in the 3-0 semi-fi­nal win over Lyon.</p>
    <p>Le­wandowski fin­ished as the com­pe­ti­tion’s top scorer with 15 goals, two short of Ron­aldo’s record for a sin­gle sea­son and was dubbed “Le­wangoalski” by team­mate Thomas Muller.</p>
    <p>He also fin­ished top scorer in the Bun­desliga and the German Cup.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber, he was named Uefa’s Player of the Year af­ter Bay­ern added the Uefa Su­per Cup to their Bun­desliga, German Cup and Cham­pi­ons League ti­tles and he could com­plete the set in Fe­bru­ary if the Bavar­ian gi­ants win the Club World Cup in Qatar.</p>
    <p>On the big­gest in­di­vid­ual award he has re­ceived, Le­wandowski, who also led his coun­try to Euro 2020 qual­i­fi­ca­tion, said: “To win such an award and share this ti­tle with Messi and Ron­aldo, is un­be­liev­able and means so much to me.</p>
    <p>“I am very proud and happy. This is a great day for me, and also for my club and col­leagues.</p>
    <p>“This award also be­longs to my col­leagues, the coach and Bay­ern in gen­eral. It is an in­cred­i­ble feel­ing, a lot of emo­tions.”</p>
    <p>Manch­ester City full-back Lucy Bronze won the Best Women’s Player award, be­com­ing the first fe­male Eng­lish player to take the prize, while Jur­gen Klopp was named the Best Men’s Coach for the sec­ond suc­ces­sive year af­ter guid­ing Liver­pool to a first Pre­mier League ti­tle in 30 years.</p>
    <p>To win such an award and share this ti­tle with Messi and Ron­aldo, is un­be­liev­able and means so much to me... It is an in­cred­i­ble feel­ing, a lot of emo­tions.</p>
