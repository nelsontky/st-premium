    <p>Bri­tain is set to kick off Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tions to­mor­row, while the United States may com­mence in­oc­u­la­tions us­ing a Pfiz­erBioNTech vac­cine as early as Fri­day. Queen El­iz­a­beth II and Prince Philip are ex­pected to be among those who will re­ceive a shot as part of the coun­try’s first wave of in­oc­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON Bri­tain will start Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tions to­mor­row, with Queen El­iz­a­beth II re­port­edly to get a jab as part of the coun­try’s first wave of in­oc­u­la­tions. Vac­ci­na­tions could also be­gin as early as Fri­day in the United States.</p>
    <p>The news comes as coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions and fa­tal­i­ties con­tinue to rise in the US, the worst-hit na­tion, ac­count­ing for about a fifth of all Covid-19 cases and deaths world­wide.</p>
    <p>In Bri­tain – which has seen the most num­ber of Covid-19 deaths in Europe – Queen El­iz­a­beth, 94, and her hus­band, Prince Philip, 99, will likely re­ceive the Pfizer</p>
    <p>BioNTech vac­cine within weeks.</p>
    <p>The royal cou­ple will then share the news of their vac­ci­na­tion to help com­bat anti-vac­cine con­spir­acy the­o­ries that have left some Bri­tons scep­ti­cal.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine was ap­proved for mass use in Bri­tain last week. The coun­try has bought 40 mil­lion doses of vac­cine, enough to in­oc­u­late 20 mil­lion peo­ple on a two­dose reg­i­men. The shots will be given in or­der of pri­or­ity, with the first vac­cines go­ing to those in care homes, in­clud­ing work­ers, and peo­ple aged over 80.</p>
    <p>“This com­ing week will be a his­toric mo­ment as we be­gin vac­ci­na­tion against Covid-19,” Health Secretary Matt Han­cock said.</p>
    <p>The plan calls for more than 1,000 cen­tres across the coun­try to pro­vide the shots over the com­ing weeks, with the first jab ex­pected to be given to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Mr Han­cock told the Tele­graph that Bri­tain may be able to ease virus re­stric­tions by the end of March fol­low­ing the vac­ci­na­tions.</p>
    <p>The roll-out co­in­cides with a cru­cial and per­ilous mo­ment in ne­go­ti­a­tions be­tween Bri­tain and the Euro­pean Union on a post-Brexit trade agree­ment.</p>
    <p>A sta­tus quo tran­si­tion pe­riod will end on Dec 31 and a no-deal sce­nario would lead to ma­jor dis­rup­tions in the move­ment of goods be­tween Bri­tain and EU coun­tries such as Bel­gium.</p>
    <p>The Observer news­pa­per re­ported yes­ter­day that un­der Bri­tish gov­ern­ment con­tin­gency plans, tens of mil­lions of vac­cine doses could be flown to Bri­tain by mil­i­tary air­craft to avoid de­lays at ports caused by Brexit.</p>
    <p>Else­where in Europe, Switzer­land is pre­par­ing to start vac­ci­na­tions next month and ex­pects to com­plete the in­oc­u­la­tions by sum­mer. Up to 70,000 vac­ci­na­tions per day are planned.</p>
    <p>Bel­gium, France and Spain have also said that jabs will be­gin next month for their most vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia started wide­spread vac­ci­na­tion of its front-line work­ers and other high-risk peo­ple in its cap­i­tal of Moscow on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>In the US, the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine could be in use by Fri­day if the Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA) ap­proves an emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion, ac­cord­ing to Dr James Hil­dreth, a mem­ber of the ad­min­is­tra­tion’s vac­cine ad­vi­sory com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>The panel is sched­uled to vote on the mat­ter at a Thurs­day meet­ing, which would al­low vac­ci­na­tions to be­gin across the coun­try from the next day.</p>
    <p>The de­vel­op­ment came as Cal­i­for­nia set an­other record for Covid-19 in­fec­tions on Satur­day, with more than half the state now fac­ing new re­stric­tions. New York City’s out­break sim­i­larly wors­ened. Across the coun­try, deaths from the disease are ris­ing sharply.</p>
    <p>In Asia, South Korea’s new daily cases reached a nine-month high yes­ter­day with 631 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Chung Sye-kyun raised the so­cial dis­tanc­ing alert for the greater Seoul area to 2.5 from two, ban­ning all gath­er­ings of more than 50 peo­ple. Cafes will con­tinue to serve only take­aways, while restau­rants must close by 9pm, with only de­liv­er­ies per­mit­ted af­ter­wards.</p>
    <p>Other coun­tries will also see hol­i­day re­stric­tions, with Switzer­land ban­ning Christ­mas car­olling in the streets and the Span­ish cap­i­tal Madrid can­celling most New Year events in the city cen­tre.</p>
    <p>LONDON • Bri­tain’s Queen El­iz­a­beth will re­ceive the Pfizer-BioNTech coro­n­avirus vac­cine within weeks, af­ter Bri­tish reg­u­la­tors granted emer­gency ap­proval and the world’s first roll-out be­gins this week.</p>
    <p>The monarch, 94, and her 99-year-old hus­band, Prince Philip, are in line to get the jab early due to their age and will not re­ceive pref­er­en­tial treat­ment, the Mail on Sunday re­ported.</p>
    <p>The news­pa­per said Bri­tain’s most se­nior roy­als would re­veal they have been given the in­oc­u­la­tion “to en­cour­age more peo­ple to take up the vi­tal jab”, amid fears that peo­ple who op­pose vac­ci­na­tion could dent en­thu­si­asm for it.</p>
    <p>In 1957, the Queen let it be known that Prince Charles and Princess Anne had re­ceived po­lio vac­cines, help­ing build public sup­port, the pa­per said.</p>
    <p>Buck­ing­ham Palace did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Last Wed­nes­day, Bri­tain granted emer­gency ap­proval to the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine, with health of­fi­cials set to use cri­te­ria based on age and vul­ner­a­bil­ity to de­cide the or­der of peo­ple to re­ceive it.</p>
    <p>The Daily Mir­ror also re­ported that a string of high-pro­file fig­ures in Bri­tain had com­mit­ted pub­licly to get­ting the vac­cine in a bid to boost take-up. They in­clude Monty Python star Michael Palin and singer-song­writer Bob Geldof, the tabloid said.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment will start a large-scale ad­ver­tis­ing cam­paign, fronted by celebri­ties and other trusted voices be­fore Christ­mas to sup­port vac­ci­na­tion ef­forts, Health Secretary Matt Han­cock told the Tele­graph.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing a vac­cine “will bring for­ward the mo­ment when we can get rid of these blasted re­stric­tions”, Mr Han­cock said of the coun­try’s rules to pre­vent the spread of the virus. “But un­til then we have got to follow them.”</p>
    <p>Reg­u­la­tors were forced to de­fend their world-first ap­proval last Wed­nes­day of the Pfiz­erBioNTech vac­cine, in­sist­ing that it met all safety stan­dards, af­ter the United States and Euro­pean of­fi­cials queried the rapid process.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple should have “no doubt what­ever that this is a very safe and highly ef­fec­tive vac­cine”, Dr June Raine, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Bri­tain’s medicine watch­dog Medicines and Health­care prod­ucts Reg­u­la­tory Agency, said on BBC TV’s An­drew Marr Show yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“The high­est stan­dards of scru­tiny, of safety and of ef­fec­tive­ness and qual­ity have been met. In­ter­na­tional stan­dards,” she said, adding that the vac­cine “will help us turn the cor­ner”.</p>
    <p>As of yes­ter­day af­ter­noon, Bri­tain had recorded a cu­mu­la­tive to­tal of more than 1.7 mil­lion Covid-19 cases, ac­cord­ing to data compiled by Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity, with more than 61,000 deaths.</p>
