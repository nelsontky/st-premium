    <p>Ad­di­tive man­u­fac­tur­ing – of­ten known as 3D print­ing – might seem more suited to high-tech in­dus­trial fac­to­ries, but it can sup­port many other sec­tors, such as health­care, a panel dis­cus­sion said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Khoo Teck Puat Hos­pi­tal (KTPH) se­nior prin­ci­pal di­eti­tian Gla­dys Wong said 3D-printed food can feed the el­derly and those with chew­ing or swal­low­ing dif­fi­cul­ties, such as pa­tients with stroke, pro­gres­sive de­men­tia and those who might be too frail to eat.</p>
    <p>But most pureed food does not look ap­petis­ing and may be re­jected by pa­tients, re­sult­ing in mal­nu­tri­tion. This is where 3D-printed food can be cre­ated in ap­peal­ing shapes, while be­ing pureed and con­tain­ing the nec­es­sary nu­tri­ents.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong said: “We (can) per­son­alise palat­able and vis­ually pre­sentable pureed food (to cre­ate) a dig­ni­fied and plea­sur­able din­ing ex­pe­ri­ence that is af­ford­able...</p>
    <p>“So we look at safety and also from a vis­ual per­spec­tive, the food should look ap­peal­ing such that they are will­ing to eat more.”</p>
    <p>KTPH is work­ing with the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy and De­sign (SUTD) and Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity on sev­eral 3D food-print­ing re­search pro­jects.</p>
    <p>The hos­pi­tal will be the test-bed kitchen when the re­search is com­pleted, with a printer, food inks and food safety reg­u­la­tions in place.</p>
    <p>“All this is in line with cre­at­ing a health­care sys­tem that is ready for our age­ing pop­u­la­tion,” said Ms Wong, who was on a panel dis­cussing the com­mer­cial­i­sa­tion and adop­tion of 3D-printed food that was held in con­junc­tion with the In­dus­try Trans­for­ma­tion Asia-Pa­cific event that ended yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“From a food-ser­vice pro­duc­tion per­spec­tive, we want to feed the el­derly with safe 3D-printed meals with con­sis­tent tex­ture re­peat­edly and that are palat­able, so we can pre­vent mal­nu­tri­tion and sar­cope­nia,” she added. Sar­cope­nia is a con­di­tion where a per­son loses mus­cle mass and strength.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong said any food that is nu­tri­tious can be 3D-printed, in­clud­ing in­sect pro­tein, bones, car­ti­lage, “ugly” pro­duce and seeds that would oth­er­wise be dis­carded.</p>
    <p>These ma­te­ri­als can be ground into paste form and printed into vis­ually at­trac­tive 3D cre­ations.</p>
    <p>An­other vari­a­tion would be to cus­tomise 3D-printed food as per­son­alised nu­tri­tion, based on an in­di­vid­ual’s needs and pref­er­ences.</p>
    <p>Be­sides health­care, 3D-printed food can also solve cur­rent food se­cu­rity and sus­tain­abil­ity is­sues, say ex­perts.</p>
    <p>SUTD’s head of pil­lar for engi­neer­ing prod­uct de­vel­op­ment Chua Chee Kai said: “An im­por­tant as­pect is food se­cu­rity and sus­tain­abil­ity, where we can lit­er­ally pul­verise any food, whether food waste or food and in­sect pro­tein which oth­er­wise will not be ac­cept­able by the ma­jor­ity to eat as they are.”</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Chua, who is also lead­ing a dig­i­tal food project, added that it will be up to tech­nol­o­gists to cre­ate food with flavours that can taste like any­thing an in­di­vid­ual wishes.</p>
    <p>Dr Ling Ka Yi, co-founder and chief sci­en­tific of­fi­cer of cell-based seafood com­pany Shiok Meats, is also ex­plor­ing 3D-printed seafood.</p>
    <p>“We’re still de­vel­op­ing the rest of the tech­nol­ogy to scale up how we pro­duce the pro­teins, and then we (have to) cre­ate the shape and tex­ture that con­sumers are used to.”</p>
