    <p>NEW YORK • On May 3, Pavle Jo­vanovic, a f ormer bob­sleigher, rigged a chain to a crane he and his brother kept in the shop of their fam­ily’s metal works in Toms River, New Jersey.</p>
    <p>He tied the loose end around his neck and hanged him­self.</p>
    <p>Jo­vanovic, an Olympian, was just 43, but ex­pe­ri­enc­ing the shakes and tremors of­ten as­so­ci­ated with Parkinson’s dis­ease. He was also the third elite North Amer­i­can bob­sleigher to kill him­self in re­cent years after Adam Wood, 32, in 2013 and Travis Bell, 42, in 2014.</p>
    <p>In re­cent years, an in­creas­ing num­ber of ath­letes, cur­rent and re­tired, in slid­ing sports, es­pe­cially bob­sleigh and skele­ton – a sis­ter sport in which com­peti­tors slide head­first on a small sledge made of metal and car­bon fi­bre – have said they bat­tle chronic headaches, a height­ened sen­si­tiv­ity to bright lights and loud noises, for­get­ful­ness and psy­cho­log­i­cal prob­lems.</p>
    <p>Only a few hun­dred peo­ple pur­sue slid­ing sports se­ri­ously in the United States and Canada at any time, which makes the preva­lence of these symp­toms and the early deaths, which are of­ten re­lated to brain in­juries, stark.</p>
    <p>For years, the tight-knit slid­ing sports com­mu­nity has viewed brain in­juries as a prob­lem for foot­ball and other di­rect con­tact sports.</p>
    <p>But Jo­vanovic’s de­te­ri­o­ra­tion and sui­cide, so soon after Steven Hol­comb’s death from an over­dose, have forced it to con­front dif­fi­cult ques­tions with un­cer­tain an­swers.</p>
    <p>Brain ex­perts who have stud­ied these ath­letes say the symp­toms most likely stem, at least in part, from years of en­dur­ing the no­to­ri­ous crashes, rou­tine head bang­ing, brain-rat­tling vi­bra­tions and strong grav­i­ta­tional ac­cel­er­a­tion forces that are com­mon in their sports.</p>
    <p>The ath­letes even have a name for the ex­hausted fog that even a rou­tine run down the track can leave them in. They call it “sledge head”, a term that trou­bles brain ex­perts be­cause they say it has nor­malised the clas­sic symp­toms as­so­ci­ated with con­cus­sions and mild trau­matic brain in­juries fa­mil­iar to those who par­tic­i­pate in high-im­pact sports.</p>
    <p>Dr Brian Ben­son, the chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer for the Canadian Sport In­sti­tute in Cal­gary, Al­berta, com­pares it to shaken baby syn­drome, but for adults.</p>
    <p>Even on a rou­tine run with­out a crash, the bob­sleigh whips in and out of the tighter turns, and heads slap hard against its fi­bre­glass side.</p>
    <p>When the 630kg sledges crash, they ca­reen out of con­trol at 128kmh with two or four peo­ple aboard.</p>
    <p>No one is wear­ing a seat belt. Heads slam into walls, into other heads and into the sledge it­self. Ul­ti­mately, ev­ery­one slides down the rest of the way, of­ten un­der­neath the ve­hi­cle, their hel­mets grind­ing along the ice at speeds as fast as 96kmh.</p>
    <p>Lugers, who slide feet first and reach the high­est speeds, ex­pe­ri­ence some of the same forces, but suf­fer far fewer con­cus­sion-like symp­toms, prob­a­bly be­cause a support strap of­ten pre­vents their heads from bang­ing into the ice.</p>
    <p>While ex­perts be­lieve slid­ing sports pose sig­nif­i­cant dan­gers to the brain, even the lead­ing neu­ro­sci­en­tists read­ily ac­knowl­edge how much they do not know.</p>
    <p>Dr Robert Stern, di­rec­tor of clin­i­cal re­search for Bos­ton Uni­ver­sity’s CTE (Chronic Trau­matic En­cephalopa­thy) Centre, said: “It’s not a sur­prise to me that bob­sleigh and skele­ton ath­letes have a huge amount of repet­i­tive mild brain trauma, and it’s not an in­cred­i­ble leap to say that would lead to these kinds of symp­toms and cause in­cred­i­ble dis­rup­tion of emo­tional reg­u­la­tion.”</p>
