    <p>It is not ev­ery day you get to wear mil­lions of dol­lars worth of Cartier jew­ellery.</p>
    <p>For many peo­ple, di­a­monds are a once-in-a-life­time af­fair – usu­ally stuck to a gold band and ac­com­pa­nied with pa­per­work for a BuildTo-Or­der flat.</p>
    <p>So, when in the name of work, I am of­fered a chance to pre­view and try on high-jew­ellery pieces from Cartier, I jump at it.</p>
    <p>The French l ux­ury house re­leased its new high-jew­ellery launches in phases start­ing from June. There are sev­eral price­less pre­cious gems and some new ad­di­tions to the Pan­there de Cartier line (eas­ily iden­ti­fi­able from the house’s iconic spot­ted fe­line).</p>
    <p>Pre­views for the trav­el­ling col­lec­tion are by ap­point­ment only, mostly for VIP clients, and I am here on one of its last few days in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Af­ter oohing and aahing from be­hind glass cases, a col­league and I are ush­ered into a pri­vate room to try on the pieces.</p>
    <p>We be­gin with the creme de la creme – the Dioscures neck­lace, part of Cartier’s Mag­ni­tude high­jew­ellery col­lec­tion.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, this beauty of per­fectly laid di­a­monds caught ev­ery­one’s at­ten­tion – for the pair of 26.35and 26.37-carat, Type IIa di­a­monds an­chor­ing the neck­lace.</p>
    <p>Type IIa di­a­monds are some of the world’s rarest stones. Less than 2 per cent of nat­u­ral di­a­monds meet the Ge­mo­log­i­cal In­sti­tute of Amer­ica’s (GIA) cri­te­ria to be clas­si­fied as such.</p>
    <p>Th­ese two are a GIA colour grade D – the high­est on the scale – and a clar­ity grade of In­ter­nally Flaw­less, cer­ti­fied colour­less rar­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Cartier does not dis­close the prices of its high jew­ellery, but the Dioscures set, which comes with ear­rings, is be­lieved to be priced up­wards of $30 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Up close, the neck­lace is hyp­no­tis­ing, catch­ing light at ev­ery an­gle.</p>
    <p>I sud­denly think of the scene in the 2018 heist film Ocean’s 8, in which Anne Hath­away tries on a $150-mil­lion Cartier neck­lace.</p>
    <p>Any minute now, I am ex­pect­ing guards to bring in a spe­cial mag­net to un­clasp it – or ar­rest me.</p>
    <p>I arch my neck this way and that, like Hath­away did, to ad­mire it. The di­a­monds sit cold on my skin, but it can­not beat the icy re­al­i­sa­tion that my net worth will never come close to this. Is this how it feels to be weighed down by wealth?</p>
    <p>Bril­liance aside, the Dioscures neck­lace is a mar­vel in crafts­man­ship. The 107 smaller di­a­monds (to­talling 93.93 carats) lin­ing it are laid to cas­cade nat­u­rally with­out a sin­gle piece be­ing ob­scured.</p>
    <p>Dubbed a “trans­former piece” or mod­u­lar jew­ellery, the neck­lace’s two pear-shaped di­a­mond drops can be re­moved and trans­ferred onto the ear­rings.</p>
    <p>The neck­lace is a bit too rich for my blood, but the ear­rings I could get be­hind. When it comes time to un­clasp them from my ears, I feel wist­ful.</p>
    <p>The next set quickly dis­tracts me from pin­ing.</p>
    <p>The Pan­there de Cartier has been a fix­ture in the Cartier uni­verse since the big cat first graced a wrist­watch in 1914.</p>
    <p>Over the years, it was rein­vented to suit chang­ing tastes, tak­ing on in­creas­ingly three-di­men­sional and graphic sil­hou­ettes – like to­day’s neck­lace in front of me.</p>
    <p>In­spired by the in­dus­trial lines of the Eif­fel Tower, the mas­sive choker is set with white gold, emer­alds, di­a­monds and cheeky ac­cents of onyx as the twin pan­thers’ noses – to bring out the bril­liance of the di­a­monds in con­trast.</p>
    <p>As Cartier’s high-jew­ellery com­mu­nity man­ager Eu­gene Wong pro­ceeds to un­lock and clasp it around my neck, I bite back the urge to shout “Wakanda for­ever”.</p>
    <p>This year’s Pan­there de Cartier ad­di­tions in­clude bracelets and rings in the same de­tailed make – es­ti­mated to be $1 mil­lion or so.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, we try another set of mod­u­lar jew­ellery – the Varan­tia set from the Mag­ni­tude col­lec­tion. Com­pris­ing a neck­lace, ear­rings and ring, the set spot­lights un­treated, pi­geon-blood Burmese ru­bies.</p>
    <p>A pre­cious stone with th­ese qual­i­ties is ex­tremely rare, Mr Wong tells us. And the Varan­tia neck­lace con­tains seven of th­ese cush­ion­shaped ru­bies (to­talling 17.61 carats), which glow se­duc­tively from among the white gold, onyx and di­a­monds.</p>
    <p>Con­trast­ing red and the black of onyx has been a Cartier colour com­bi­na­tion since the be­gin­ning of the 20th cen­tury.</p>
    <p>In­spired by the multi-lay­ered jew­ellery of ma­hara­jas, the long and short neck­laces can be worn to­gether or sep­a­rately. The long neck­lace can also be turned into a bracelet and a shorter neck­lace for ev­ery­day wear.</p>
    <p>The hours fly by and I leave the store in a daze, some­how a changed woman from an after­noon of play­mod­elling bling.</p>
    <p>There is some­thing es­capist about gin­gerly han­dling jew­ellery which I can never af­ford in this life­time. It is my one last Crazy Rich Asian fan­tasy to end the dreary year on a high. Af­ter all, a lit­tle sparkle dur­ing the hol­i­days never hurt any­one.</p>
