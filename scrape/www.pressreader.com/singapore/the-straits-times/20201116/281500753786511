    <p>•</p>
    <p>The words “Still I Rise” are tat­tooed large across Lewis Hamil­ton’s shoul­der blades and that as­ser­tion has been self-ev­i­dent this year.</p>
    <p>The Mercedes driver’s sev­enth For­mula One cham­pi­onship was se­cured in Turkey with three races to spare yes­ter­day, rais­ing him to new heights as the sport’s joint­most suc­cess­ful driver of all time and with surely more to come.</p>
    <p>“I feel like I’m only just get­ting started,” he said after winning the Turk­ish Grand Prix for a record­e­qualling sev­enth driv­ers’ ti­tle, match­ing Fer­rari great Michael Schu­macher’s feat.</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton has al­ready pow­ered past the Ger­man when it comes to wins (94), pole po­si­tions (97), podi­ums (163) and most con­sec­u­tive points fin­ishes (47), and the Bri­ton told re­porters that it was the cul­mi­na­tion of a child­hood dream.</p>
    <p>“Def­i­nitely a bit lost for words. I think I have to al­ways start with say­ing a huge thank you to all the guys here and back at the fac­tory for giv­ing us this op­por­tu­nity,” he said. “I wouldn’t be able to do this if I didn’t join this team (in 2013). The jour­ney we have been on has been mon­u­men­tal.</p>
    <p>“I know I of­ten I say it is be­yond (my) wildest dreams but my whole life, se­cretly I have dreamt as high as this.</p>
    <p>“It felt so far fetched. I re­mem­ber watch­ing Michael win those world cham­pi­onships. To get one or two or even three is so hard.</p>
    <p>“Seven is unimag­in­able. There is no end to what we can do to­gether, me and this team.</p>
    <p>“We dreamed of this when I was young. It is so im­por­tant for kids to see this and don’t lis­ten to any­one who says you can’t achieve some­thing. Dream the im­pos­si­ble. You have got to chase it and never give up.”</p>
    <p>De­spite start­ing sixth on the grid, the 35-year-old sealed his lat­est ti­tle with a typ­i­cally mea­sured master­class.</p>
    <p>In what will go down as one of his finest tri­umphs, he han­dled treach­er­ous wet early con­di­tions to lap his only re­main­ing ti­tle ri­val Valt­teri Bot­tas for his 10th vic­tory in 14 races this sea­son.</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton came home over half a minute clear of Ser­gio Perez for Rac­ing Point, while Se­bas­tian Vet­tel earned his first podium of the term after fin­ish­ing third.</p>
    <p>Mercedes team prin­ci­pal Toto Wolff felt the race at Is­tan­bul Park showed why his star driver is a cut</p>
    <p>above the com­pe­ti­tion, telling Sky Sports: “It shows how he is ca­pa­ble to the sit­u­a­tion that went against him, he was the only one who kept it on the road and that is the dif­fer­ence to­day.</p>
    <p>“Look at what has hap­pened to­day, he was as hun­gry as a lion, driv­ing a car on slicks in the end. I don’t see any of the mo­ti­va­tion stop­ping.</p>
    <p>“This year has been very, very spe­cial, in dif­fi­cult cir­cum­stances for ev­ery­one... I hope we’ve en­ter­tained and that’s why com­ing on top after such a year in such a tough race, it’s ex­cep­tional.”</p>
    <p>Bot­tas, who fin­ished 14th after a desul­tory out­ing that saw him spin sev­eral times, ad­mit­ted that his Sil­ver Ar­rows team­mate was the su­pe­rior driver, adding: “He de­serves it fully. He was bet­ter over­all. It is re­ally good for him. I will try to beat him next year.”</p>
    <p>Eng­land foot­ball great Gary Lineker, for­mer Manch­ester United de­fender Rio Fer­di­nand and for­mer Mercedes team­mate and 2016 cham­pion Nico Ros­berg led the cho­rus of praise after Hamil­ton’s lat­est achieve­ment.</p>
    <p>Pun­dit Fer­di­nand tweeted: “Just watched Lewis Hamil­ton drive to his 7th world ti­tle. The great­est sports­man this coun­try has ever pro­duced – no doubts.”</p>
    <p>Lineker agreed, tweet­ing: “Has to be right up there along­side our great­est ever sports­peo­ple. Stun­ning”, while Ros­berg said it was “mas­sively de­served” and one of the “great­est achieve­ments in the his­tory of sport”.</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton’s con­tin­ued F1 mas­tery also re­newed calls for him to be knighted, with com­pa­triot and McLaren driver Lando Nor­ris say­ing: “Only one per­son in the whole world has achieved what he has done, that is Michael Schu­macher.</p>
    <p>“He has led both on and off the track, and other ath­letes who have done such things in sport have been hon­oured. So I see no rea­son why he shouldn’t.”</p>
    <p>WHEN THERE’S A WILL</p>
    <p>I know I of­ten I say it is be­yond (my) wildest dreams but my whole life, se­cretly I have dreamt as high as this.</p>
    <p>LEWIS HAMIL­TON, Mercedes driver, who has now tied Michael Schu­macher on seven F1 driv­ers’ ti­tles.</p>
