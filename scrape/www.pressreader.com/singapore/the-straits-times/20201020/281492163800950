    <p>MS EMILIE PALAMY PRADICHIT, direc­tor of the Manushya Foun­da­tion, ac­cus­ing the Thai gov­ern­ment of try­ing to si­lence the me­dia.</p>
    <p>AP­PEAL AGAINST VI­O­LENCE</p>
    <p>We are just ask­ing peo­ple not to do wrong and de­stroy the gov­ern­ment and peo­ple’s prop­erty... I re­quest that pro­test­ers rally peace­fully. The gov­ern­ment has al­ready com­pro­mised to some de­gree.</p>
    <p>PRIME MIN­IS­TER PRAYUT CHAN-O-CHA, in a bid to re­duce ten­sions.</p>
    <p>BANGKOK • Po­lice in Thai­land said yes­ter­day that they have or­dered an in­ves­ti­ga­tion of four news out­lets un­der emer­gency mea­sures in­tro­duced last week and im­posed curbs on mes­sag­ing app Tele­gram to try to stop three months of protests against the gov­ern­ment and monar­chy.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment prompted anger from me­dia groups and ac­cu­sa­tions of an at­tack on press free­dom by the gov­ern­ment of Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha, the former junta leader the pro­test­ers are seek­ing to drive from of­fice.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a po­lice doc­u­ment dated Oct 16, in­ves­ti­ga­tions have been or­dered into con­tent from four me­dia out­lets as well as the Face­book page of a protest group.</p>
    <p>“We re­ceived in­for­ma­tion from in­tel­li­gence units con­cerned that parts of the con­tent and dis­torted in­for­ma­tion have been used and dis­sem­i­nated to cause con­fu­sion and in­sti­gate caus­ing un­rest to so­ci­ety,” said po­lice spokesman Kis­sana</p>
    <p>Phathanach­aroen at a news con­fer­ence. He said it was for Thai­land’s broad­cast reg­u­la­tor and dig­i­tal min­istry to in­ves­ti­gate and take ap­pro­pri­ate ac­tion, adding that there was no plan to curb press free­dom.</p>
    <p>Mr Putchapong Nodthaison­g, a spokesman for the dig­i­tal min­istry, said it had re­quested court or­ders to take down con­tent by the four me­dia out­lets and the Face­book page of the protest group Free Youth, among more than 300,000 pieces of con­tent that it said vi­o­lated Thai laws over the last week.</p>
    <p>The Manushya Foun­da­tion, an in­de­pen­dent group which cam­paigns for on­line free­dom, called the mea­sures an at­tempt to si­lence free me­dia. “Since the ban on protests did not work, the mil­i­tary-backed gov­ern­ment hopes to cre­ate fear of telling the truth,” its direc­tor Emilie Palamy Pradichit said. “We urge free me­dia to re­sist.”</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment last Thurs­day or­dered a ban on news and on­line in­for­ma­tion that could af­fect na­tional se­cu­rity. The au­thor­i­ties also banned po­lit­i­cal gath­er­ings of five or more peo­ple in the face of the grow­ing challenge.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, po­lice chief Suwat Jangy­o­d­suk told re­porters yes­ter­day that he had or­dered the dig­i­tal min­istry to re­strict Free Youth’s group on Tele­gram, a mes­sag­ing ap­pli­ca­tion that pro­test­ers had used to co­or­di­nate in re­cent days.</p>
    <p>Mr Putchapong, the min­istry’s spokesman, de­clined to ver­ify an­other doc­u­ment, ap­par­ently signed by him, that asked In­ter­net ser­vice providers and mo­bile op­er­a­tors to “sus­pend Tele­gram” com­pletely.</p>
    <p>Protests have taken place ev­ery day since they were banned last Thurs­day, and Sun­day’s demon­stra­tions drew tens of thou­sands of peo­ple in Bangkok and across the coun­try. Yes­ter­day, pro­test­ers gath­ered again in Bangkok.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers are seek­ing the re­moval of Prime Min­is­ter Prayut, ac­cus­ing him of en­gi­neer­ing last year’s elec­tion to hold on to the power he first seized in a 2014 coup. Mr Prayut main­tains that the elec­tion was fair, and he will not quit.</p>
    <p>The pro­test­ers have also grown more vo­cal in de­mand­ing re­forms to the monar­chy to re­duce the pow­ers of King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, speak­ing at Gov­ern­ment House yes­ter­day, Mr Prayut said he sup­ported a pro­posal for a spe­cial Par­lia­ment ses­sion to dis­cuss how to re­duce the ten­sion, and he also adopted a softer tone with the pro­test­ers.</p>
    <p>“We are just ask­ing peo­ple not to do wrong and de­stroy the gov­ern­ment and peo­ple’s prop­erty,” he said. “What the gov­ern­ment needs to do is to pro­tect the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>“I re­quest that pro­test­ers rally peace­fully. The gov­ern­ment has al­ready com­pro­mised to some de­gree,” he added.</p>
