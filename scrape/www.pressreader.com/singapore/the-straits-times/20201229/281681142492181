    <p>SEOUL • South Korean of­fi­cials are vow­ing to speed up ef­forts to launch a pub­lic coro­n­avirus vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme as the coun­try yes­ter­day an­nounced it had detected its first cases of the virus vari­ant linked to the rapid rise in in­fec­tions in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>The new vari­ant, thought to be more trans­mis­si­ble than oth­ers cur­rently cir­cu­lat­ing, was found in three peo­ple who had en­tered South Korea from London last Tues­day, the Korea Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion Agency (KDCA) said.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the KDCA re­ported 808 new cases as at mid­night on Sun­day, the low­est since a record 1,241 in­fec­tions were logged last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties cau­tioned that the drop may be due to less test­ing done over the week­end and the Christ­mas hol­i­day, and said on Sun­day that they would be ex­tend­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures un­til early next month.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s gov­ern­ment has faced mount­ing do­mes­tic crit­i­cism over its vac­cine pro­cure­ment and roll-out plans, which call for the first vac­ci­na­tions to be­gin in the first quar­ter of next year, months after places such as the United States and the Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>Neg­a­tive views of the vac­cine plans were one of the lead­ing rea­sons that drove Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in’s dis­ap­proval rat­ing to an all-time high of nearly 60 per cent, poll­ster Real­me­ter said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­la­tors will shorten the pe­riod re­quired to ap­prove vac­cines and treat­ments from an av­er­age of 180 days to as lit­tle as 40 days, the Min­istry of Food and Drug Safety an­nounced on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>An ad­di­tional ap­proval process for the dis­tri­bu­tion and sale of vac­cines, which usu­ally takes sev­eral months, will be short­ened to around 20 days, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>Med­i­cal work­ers and el­derly res­i­dents will be­gin re­ceiv­ing the vac­ci­na­tions in Fe­bru­ary, and plans to vac­ci­nate the broader pub­lic are ac­cel­er­at­ing, pres­i­den­tial chief of staff Noh Young-min said on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment is do­ing all it can to ad­vance this time­frame and is also mak­ing progress,” he said.</p>
    <p>South Korea has said it plans to buy enough doses to even­tu­ally vac­ci­nate 46 mil­lion peo­ple, or more than 85 per cent of its pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The pres­i­den­tial chief of staff said the au­thor­i­ties ex­pected South Korea’s pop­u­la­tion to reach a level of herd im­mu­nity through the vac­cines as fast as or faster than many other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>South Korea has re­ported a to­tal of 57,680 coro­n­avirus cases, with 819 deaths.</p>
