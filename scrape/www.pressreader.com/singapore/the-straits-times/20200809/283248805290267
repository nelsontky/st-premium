    <p>Should you start spend­ing the money that you have saved in your Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) at 55? You don’t need to know rocket sci­ence to an­swer this ques­tion – a sim­ple maths cal­cu­la­tion will give you the in­sights you need.</p>
    <p>It is a fact that due to the over­all im­prove­ment in our health, the aver­age longevity of Sin­ga­pore­ans has in­creased, with half of today’s 65-year-olds ex­pected to live be­yond 85.</p>
    <p>So as­sum­ing you start to spend your re­tire­ment sav­ings at 55 – even if you just need $500 a month, you will need to have $180,000 to last you through to 85. If your spend­ing in­creases to $1,000 a month, you need sav­ings of $360,000.</p>
    <p>But if you want to have a cosier life­style with $2,000 a month, you need $720,000.</p>
    <p>If you are shocked by such num­bers, the good news is that these sums are not out of reach for or­di­nary work­ers. This is what the CPF Life longevity in­sur­ance seeks to pro­vide for all present and fu­ture re­tirees.</p>
    <p>It is also why re­tire­ment ex­perts strongly dis­cour­age peo­ple from touch­ing their re­tire­ment money at 55, be­cause ev­ery­one needs to save enough to last not just a few years, but over three decades or more.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, not ev­ery­one is as lucky – there are only 37 coun­tries that have some form of re­tire­ment scheme, but even so, not all of them pro­vide ad­e­quate sup­port that can last through old age.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s CPF Life can pro­vide de­cent to good monthly pay­outs for life, at rel­a­tively low thresh­olds, even look­ing at the high­est sums that will be set aside in 2022.</p>
    <p>A re­tire­ment pot of $96,000 by the age of 55 will as­sure guar­an­teed monthly pay­ments of up to $850 a month from age 65. One of $192,000 will yield $1,600 a month, while a $288,000 sum de­liv­ers $2,300.</p>
    <p>A per­son who set aside the small­est amount – $96,000 – would have re­ceived $204,000 if he lives to 85. It’s $384,000 for those who ac­cu­mu­lated $192,000, and $552,200 for re­tirees who put away $288,000.</p>
    <p>And those who live longer will con­tinue to re­ceive these monthly pay­ments.</p>
    <p>This is why CPF is ranked so highly glob­ally – not many Sin­ga­pore­ans can gen­er­ate and earn these kinds of re­turns for them­selves.</p>
    <p>This is es­pe­cially true now when the whole world is in trou­ble due to the pan­demic and there is no telling how long and deep the re­ces­sion will be.</p>
    <p>This begs the ques­tion: Why do some peo­ple still want to empty their CPF ac­counts when do­ing so is likely to hurt them later?</p>
    <p>Based on the many cases that CPF of­fi­cials have come across, many of those who with­draw their CPF at 55 do not have an ur­gent need for the cash; they take out the money only to put it in their own sav­ings ac­counts that do not earn any mean­ing­ful re­turns.</p>
    <p>There are two rea­sons why they do this. The first is due to their poor un­der­stand­ing of the scheme be­cause they lis­ten to peo­ple who are sim­i­larly ig­no­rant. As they also do not bother to check on their own, they fol­low the wrong herd, think­ing that it is pru­dent to with­draw from CPF at 55, when it is not.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond rea­son is more lu­di­crous – it is based on il­log­i­cal fears that if they leave any money be­hind in the CPF, they will not see it as the Gov­ern­ment will al­legedly come up with more rea­sons to de­prive them of their money.</p>
    <p>Just go to any so­cial me­dia forum and you are likely to stum­ble across some of these com­ments that are highly crit­i­cal of the CPF.</p>
    <p>Some even go as far as to ad­vise younger work­ers that to avoid be­ing “scammed”, they should de­plete their CPF bal­ances by us­ing them to pay for a prop­erty, for ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>Such com­ments run counter to what the in­de­pen­dent panel of ex­perts at the Mel­bourne Mer­cer Global Pen­sion In­dex has found – that Sin­ga­pore’s CPF is the best re­tire­ment scheme in Asia for its ad­e­quacy, sus­tain­abil­ity and in­tegrity.</p>
    <p>In­deed, the ex­perts cau­tion that hav­ing suf­fi­cient sav­ings for re­tire­ment is no longer a lux­ury, but an es­sen­tial and nec­es­sary ac­tion for ev­ery­one be­cause ad­vances in med­i­cal sci­ence are likely to lead to longer life for many peo­ple.</p>
    <p>So en­sur­ing that re­tirees are liv­ing in good health and can meet the costs of liv­ing be­comes an es­sen­tial is­sue for every coun­try.</p>
    <p>There is also an ur­gent need to ed­u­cate an in­creas­ing num­ber of young peo­ple who work as free­lancers in the “gig econ­omy” that they must de­velop the habit of sav­ing in their CPF, which earns higher in­ter­est, so that they do not have to con­tinue work­ing through their old age.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, the CPF is the best and safest in­vest­ment ac­count in this cli­mate be­cause even most gov­ern­ment bonds can­not match its in­ter­est rates of be­tween 2.5 per cent and 6 per cent.</p>
    <p>So in­stead of think­ing about tak­ing money out, you would do well to find ways to grow your funds through cash top-ups or re­fund­ing what you used for a mort­gage.</p>
    <p>Many se­niors are not as lucky as the younger gen­er­a­tion be­cause it has taken much ef­fort by the Gov­ern­ment to cre­ate the CPF of today that is so pro-re­tire­ment. So those who choose to be blind to these ben­e­fits will ac­tu­ally lose out to the ma­jor­ity of Sin­ga­pore­ans who know how to use the CPF to grow their money. There is no con­spir­acy be­hind the CPF – it is just sim­ple maths to let you have a com­fort­able re­tire­ment.</p>
