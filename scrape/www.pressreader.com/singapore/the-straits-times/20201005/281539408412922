    <p>Mr Don­ald Trump, sick with Covid-19, is not the only US pres­i­dent to face the pres­sure to down­play health con­cerns. The ex­pec­ta­tion that pres­i­dents be fight­ing fit has led oth­ers to mask their ail­ments and dis­abil­i­ties, says global af­fairs correspond­ent Jonathan Eyal (be­low).</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump is not the only world leader to con­tract the coro­n­avirus. Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son got in­fected at the height of the pan­demic in April, and for a while his life hung in the bal­ance. Brazil­ian Pres­i­dent Jair Bol­sonaro was also hit by the virus, as were a clutch of other lead­ers in Latin Amer­ica and Europe, from Monaco’s Prince Al­bert II on the western tip of the con­ti­nent, to the Prime Min­is­ter of Ar­me­nia on the east­ern side of Europe.</p>
    <p>And then, there is the story of the Pres­i­dent of the African state of Bu­rundi, a healthy 55-year-old who died sud­denly in June of a sus­pected coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the ill­ness of the leader of the world’s top power and what is still the world’s big­gest econ­omy is, of course, in a cat­e­gory all on its own. For Pres­i­dent Trump’s fate has im­pli­ca­tions be­yond the bor­ders of the United States.</p>
    <p>But the med­i­cal drama now un­fold­ing in a mil­i­tary hos­pi­tal out­side the US cap­i­tal also sheds light on a broader ques­tion: the po­lit­i­cal im­por­tance of the per­sonal med­i­cal con­di­tion of lead­ers in power and the im­pli­ca­tion this has on the way they gov­ern. Or, to put it dif­fer­ently, how much bi­ol­ogy is pol­i­tics, or how much of pol­i­tics should be as­cribed to per­sonal bi­o­log­i­cal con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>ROO­SEVELT AND CHURCHILL</p>
    <p>His­tory is full of ex­am­ples of peo­ple who led their na­tions to great things de­spite their phys­i­cal in­fir­mi­ties.</p>
    <p>It is by now largely for­got­ten that both the lead­ers of the US and Bri­tain, the two top Western na­tions which were in­stru­men­tal in shap­ing the post-World War II po­lit­i­cal en­vi­ron­ment we know to­day, as well as cre­at­ing most of the global in­sti­tu­tions which still gov­ern our lives, were both to­tal med­i­cal wrecks while still in of­fice.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Franklin De­lano Roo­sevelt was per­ma­nently con­fined to a wheel­chair af­ter con­tract­ing po­lio when he was 39, and when he won an un­prece­dented fourth term in of­fice in 1944, his health had de­te­ri­o­rated so much that his per­sonal physi­cian pre­dicted he wouldn’t com­plete his pres­i­den­tial term. The pre­dic­tion was spot on: A year later, the Pres­i­dent died in of­fice of a mas­sive cere­bral haem­or­rhage.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Win­ston Churchill – Roo­sevelt’s coun­ter­part in man­ag­ing the war – came to power only in his late 60s and suf­fered from what to­day’s doc­tors would clas­sify as mor­bid obe­sity. He was also a very heavy drinker and smoker, fac­tors that con­trib­uted to the se­ri­ous stroke he suf­fered a few years af­ter the end of the war.</p>
    <p>Yet, al­though the sub­stance of the po­lit­i­cal de­ci­sions ei­ther of these lead­ers took may be crit­i­cised, few would dis­agree that Roo­sevelt and Churchill were among the great­est – if not the great­est – lead­ers of their gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, both Roo­sevelt and Churchill went to great lengths to hide their med­i­cal con­di­tions. Dur­ing his life­time, most US vot­ers did not know that their Pres­i­dent was in a wheel­chair; a pli­ant US me­dia con­nived in this de­cep­tion by not pub­lish­ing any pho­to­graph show­ing him in a wheel­chair, and world lead­ers in­clud­ing Churchill dis­creetly helped by prop­ping up the US Pres­i­dent for the oblig­a­tory pho­to­graphs at var­i­ous in­ter­na­tional sum­mits.</p>
    <p>Churchill was no bet­ter. Dis­cus­sion of his med­i­cal con­di­tion was taboo as long as he re­mained in of­fice and when he did suf­fer a stroke, the Bri­tish peo­ple were told noth­ing; even the Queen was ini­tially kept in the dark.</p>
    <p>Nor is this se­crecy unique to these in­di­vid­u­als. Grover Cleve­land, the only US pres­i­dent in his­tory to have served two non-con­sec­u­tive terms, was op­er­ated for can­cer of the mouth while in of­fice in the late 19th cen­tury, and not even his vice-pres­i­dent knew of this.</p>
    <p>HEALTH-RE­LATED COVER-UPS</p>
    <p>Woodrow Wil­son, an aus­tere aca­demic who ran the US dur­ing World War I, was largely in­ca­pac­i­tated for the last two years of his pres­i­dency due to a stroke and left the business of gov­ern­ment to his wife; his in­abil­ity to lead led to the fail­ure of the global se­cu­rity sys­tem he wished to put in place, and that, in turn, was a con­tribut­ing fac­tor to the events which ul­ti­mately led to World War II.</p>
    <p>Then there was Dwight Eisen­hower, who served as US pres­i­dent in the 1950s, and who des­per­ately tried but failed to cover up his heart at­tack only be­cause the US me­dia was no longer pre­pared to be as rev­er­en­tial to au­thor­ity as it had pre­vi­ously been.</p>
    <p>And who can for­get that hand­some, youth­ful Pres­i­dent John F. Kennedy? Well, none of those who voted for him in the 1960 US elec­tions knew that their “wun­derkind” was di­ag­nosed with Ad­di­son’s dis­ease when he was 30 and had to rely on hor­mone ther­apy to fight off the de­bil­i­tat­ing ef­fects of the au­toim­mune dis­or­der.</p>
    <p>Nor were Amer­i­can vot­ers told of their Pres­i­dent’s ad­dic­tion to pro­caine – an anaes­thetic sub­stance to re­duce mus­cle pain. The man who has gone down in his­tory as a heart-throb with a toothy grin was es­sen­tially wear­ing a mask. To main­tain his im­age of vigour, he was, at times, on a cock­tail of 12 med­i­ca­tions in­clud­ing codeine, Ri­talin, anti-psy­chotics and bar­bi­tu­rates, to fight off chronic back pain, al­ler­gies and di­ges­tive tract prob­lems as well as to counter the side-ef­fects of all the medicine he was tak­ing.</p>
    <p>Over the past few decades, how­ever, it has be­come far more dif­fi­cult for lead­ers in the US or else­where to hide their med­i­cal con­di­tion, partly be­cause the elec­tronic me­dia can track their ev­ery step, but also be­cause they are ex­pected to be con­stantly avail­able, and there­fore find it im­pos­si­ble to of­fer a plau­si­ble ex­pla­na­tion for any dis­ap­pear­ance from the pub­lic eye.</p>
    <p>So, those who wish to run for pub­lic of­fice in the US now rou­tinely pub­lish their med­i­cal records. And ques­tions about a pres­i­dent’s health are now re­garded as a le­git­i­mate topic of pub­lic de­bate.</p>
    <p>Still, the de­cep­tion of per­fect health con­tin­ues, al­beit in a dif­fer­ent for­mat.</p>
    <p>Ron­ald Rea­gan, who was 70 when he came to of­fice as pres­i­dent, fa­mously dis­armed crit­ics who ar­gued that he was too old by pledg­ing “not to ex­ploit” his op­po­nents’ “youth and in­ex­pe­ri­ence”. Yet, through­out his pres­i­dency, he sported a jet-black shock of hair that he claimed was nat­u­ral, and made a spe­cific point of run­ning up and down the stairs of his Air Force One jet, just to re­mind peo­ple of how youth­ful he was, at least in spirit.</p>
    <p>TRUMP’S AP­PROACH</p>
    <p>Al­ways larger than life, Pres­i­dent Trump went even fur­ther. In his 2016 cam­paign, he pub­lished a let­ter from his own doc­tor claim­ing that if he be­came pres­i­dent, he would be “the health­i­est in­di­vid­ual ever elected”. It later turned out that Mr Trump had dic­tated the let­ter him­self.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump also made health an is­sue with which to brow­beat his op­po­nents: Back in 2016, he pub­licly mocked Mrs Hil­lary Clin­ton, his then op­po­nent, for faint­ing dur­ing the cam­paign, and nowa­days he reg­u­larly refers to Mr Joe Bi­den, his cur­rent op­po­nent, as “Sleepy Joe”, a de­lib­er­ate slur in­tended to sug­gest that the Demo­cratic can­di­date is far too old for of­fice.</p>
    <p>But it is worth point­ing out that the “health card” is be­ing played by Mr Trump’s op­po­nents as well. One of the most widely cir­cu­lated anti-Trump videos now mak­ing the rounds shows the Pres­i­dent walk­ing very slowly and hes­i­tantly down a ramp at a mil­i­tary academy cer­e­mony, an episode that has zero prac­ti­cal sig­nif­i­cance but is used to im­ply that the man who runs the US is sup­pos­edly not in con­trol of his fac­ul­ties.</p>
    <p>And it should also be men­tioned that the ob­vi­ous re­luc­tance of many politi­cians around the world to be seen wear­ing a mask in the cur­rent pan­demic is also due to fears that they may look silly or vul­ner­a­ble; the lat­est trend among politi­cians around the world to wear “de­signer masks” – usu­ally in black, some­times im­printed with na­tional em­blems or na­tional colours – is also born out of a de­sire to avoid health con­no­ta­tions by trans­form­ing the masks into mere fash­ion ac­ces­sories.</p>
    <p>Why is the health of US pres­i­dents such a touchy mat­ter? Partly be­cause elec­torates ev­ery­where ex­pect or wish their lead­ers to be some­how above av­er­age, to have more en­ergy than oth­ers and to in­spire con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>An­other ex­pla­na­tion for this cult of a healthy leader is that once a US pres­i­dent ad­mits to some in­fir­mity, the spec­u­la­tion never stops, with ev­ery day bring­ing new the­o­ries about the leader’s vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>As we see with Pres­i­dent Trump’s cur­rent hos­pi­tal treat­ment, no amount of in­for­ma­tion re­leased by his doc­tors about the Pres­i­dent’s real con­di­tion is con­sid­ered suf­fi­cient. So, the in­stinct is al­ways not to ad­mit to any frailty and to main­tain this de­nial for as long as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>A NEW MYTH?</p>
    <p>But ul­ti­mately, the ob­ses­sively ma­cho cult of the US pres­i­dency is due to the fact that power in the US is so per­son­alised, so the in­ca­pac­i­ta­tion or demise of an Amer­i­can leader can re­sult in a fun­da­men­tal change of poli­cies, lit­er­ally overnight, in a way that is un­think­able in most par­lia­men­tary sys­tems of gov­ern­ments, where Cab­i­nets are more col­le­giate, power is more dis­persed, and prime min­is­ters are not al­ways so crit­i­cal to the over­all, long-term pol­icy ori­en­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Al­though he is in a high-risk group, Mr Trump has the advantage of hav­ing an army of doc­tors to de­liver top-level care. But his catch­ing Covid-19 has up­ended plans for cam­paign ral­lies, with just weeks to go be­fore the Nov 3 polls. Should Mr Trump be de­feated in the bal­lots, he and his sup­port­ers are cer­tain to claim that they lost power un­fairly and that had it not been for the virus, he would have re­gained ground and would have won his re-elec­tion bid.</p>
    <p>So, to the long­stand­ing myth of the al­ways-healthy pres­i­dent, we may now see an ad­di­tion: the cre­ation of a new myth which claims that a pres­i­dent was de­feated merely be­cause of a vi­ral in­fec­tion.</p>
