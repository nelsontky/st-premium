    <p>A group of re­la­tion­ship man­agers from United Over­seas Bank (UOB) are be­lieved to be un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion for rec­om­mend­ing “in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties” with the former ex­ec­u­tive chair­man and act­ing chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of former Ap­ple au­tho­rised re­seller Epi­cen­tre, who had gone miss­ing last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Ken­neth Lim Tiong Hian be­came un­con­tactable in late May last year, and the com­pany fired the 45-year-old in July that year.</p>
    <p>The Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS), in re­sponse to a query by The Straits Times on whether the au­thor­i­ties are aware that a group of UOB re­la­tion­ship man­agers were ap­par­ently in­volved in rec­om­mend­ing “in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties” with Mr Lim, said: “The mat­ter is un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion by MAS and CAD (Com­mer­cial Af­fairs Depart­ment). We are un­able to com­ment fur­ther given that the in­ves­ti­ga­tion is on­go­ing.”</p>
    <p>The CAD is the po­lice unit that deals with white-col­lar crime.</p>
    <p>A UOB spokesman de­clined to re­spond for the same rea­son, adding the bank makes clear to its em­ploy­ees that be­hav­iour which could un­der­mine the con­fi­dence and trust of its stake­hold­ers will not be tol­er­ated.</p>
    <p>“Any vi­o­la­tion of UOB’s code of con­duct is taken very se­ri­ously and the bank will take the nec­es­sary and ap­pro­pri­ate ac­tion, which in­cludes dis­missal and re­port­ing the rel­e­vant in­di­vid­u­als to the au­thor­i­ties,” she said.</p>
    <p>Sources told ST the in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties were loan agree­ments signed by Mr Lim for and on be­half of Epi­cen­tre Holdings. Some of the agree­ments also bear the com­pany name Broad­well, a com­pany in­cor­po­rated in the Bri­tish Vir­gin Is­lands.</p>
    <p>Some of the loan agree­ments promised in­vestors in­ter­est rates of over 6 per cent per an­num, they added.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to pre­vi­ous re­ports and court doc­u­ments filed, losses claimed by at least five in­vestors could to­tal more than $5 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>It is not known how many of the re­la­tion­ship man­agers al­legedly in­volved are be­ing in­ves­ti­gated.</p>
    <p>MAS said: “Un­der the Fi­nan­cial Ad­vis­ers Act, a rep­re­sen­ta­tive is pro­hib­ited from act­ing for an­other firm (other than his prin­ci­pal fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion or its re­lated cor­po­ra­tion) in ad­vis­ing oth­ers on in­vest­ment prod­ucts, un­less he has ob­tained MAS’ ap­proval in writ­ing. The rep­re­sen­ta­tive is also not al­lowed to act of his own ac­cord to carry on a busi­ness of pro­vid­ing such ad­vi­sory ser­vices, un­less he is li­censed or ex­empted by MAS to do so.”</p>
    <p>MAS said con­tra­ven­tion of these re­quire­ments is an of­fence un­der the Act and it would take ac­tion against those who did so.</p>
    <p>Epi­cen­tre, a former Ap­ple au­tho­rised re­seller, sus­pended trad­ing shortly af­ter Mr Lim’s dis­ap­pear­ance last year. It is cur­rently un­der ju­di­cial man­age­ment af­ter a cred­i­tor, a Mr Goh Chee Hong, ap­plied to the High Court to re­cover a loan of $3 mil­lion to the com­pany.</p>
    <p>A Mareva in­junc­tion was also ob­tained against Mr Lim, pre­vent­ing him from dis­pos­ing any of his as­sets in Sin­ga­pore, whether solely or jointly owned, up to a value of $3.85 mil­lion. Last De­cem­ber, he was re­ported to be fac­ing a bank­ruptcy pe­ti­tion for a judg­ment over a debt of $588,020.</p>
    <p>Epi­cen­tre had pre­vi­ously said the com­pany was un­aware of five fi­nanc­ing agree­ments with two cred­i­tors amount­ing to close to $1 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The two cred­i­tors are a Span­ish cou­ple who moved their fam­ily to Sin­ga­pore be­tween 2013 and 2014 to de­velop their busi­ness in the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion. The said fi­nanc­ing agree­ments were signed by Mr Lim.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple, rep­re­sented by Mr Calvin Liang of Es­sex Court Cham­bers Dux­ton and Ark Law Cor­po­ra­tion, have com­menced le­gal pro­ceed­ings in this re­gard.</p>
    <p>Epi­cen­tre signed an agree­ment on July 13 this year with Kossen Co and Tardis Cap­i­tal, which is listed in South Korea, to trans­fer its Sin­ga­pore Ex­change list­ing for $3 mil­lion to an un­named en­tity that will be in­cor­po­rated in Sin­ga­pore. If the trans­fer is suc­cess­ful, it seeks to pro­vide some re­cov­ery to its share­hold­ers and cred­i­tors, the ju­di­cial man­agers said.</p>
    <p>Epi­cen­tre, which opened i n 2002, had more than 10 stores in Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia and China in 2011.</p>
