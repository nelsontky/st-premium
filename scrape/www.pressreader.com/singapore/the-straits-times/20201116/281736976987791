    <p>WASH­ING­TON • At a chic cafe in the West End neigh­bour­hood of Wash­ing­ton, a young waiter knew that the in­com­ing US Vice-pres­i­dent lived “up­stairs”, as he noted by ges­tur­ing to an up­scale con­do­minium build­ing over­head, but said he had not seen her lately.</p>
    <p>“The Se­cret Ser­vice some­times stops me from tak­ing out the trash,” he added, say­ing that agents closed off the build­ing’s al­ley when their pro­tectee came and went from its garage.</p>
    <p>Around the cor­ner, two black Subur­bans with fed­eral li­cence plates were parked by the build­ing’s en­trance – the only vis­i­ble clue to the nearby pres­ence of Vice-Pres­i­dent-elect Ka­mala Har­ris.</p>
    <p>In the days since he pre­vailed in the elec­tion, Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den has made sev­eral pub­lic re­marks and re­leased sum­maries of his calls with for­eign lead­ers. But Ms Har­ris has barely ap­peared on the pub­lic radar since her ac­cep­tance speech two Satur­days ago, when she de­clared “a new day for Amer­ica”.</p>
    <p>It is not un­prece­dented for a vice-pres­i­dent-elect to keep a low pro­file in an elec­tion’s af­ter­math.</p>
    <p>“You’ve been fairly in­vis­i­ble since the elec­tion,” ABC News host Ge­orge Stephanopo­u­los told Mr Bi­den in an in­ter­view more than a month after his own elec­tion as Mr Barack Obama’s vice-pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den replied by in­sist­ing that he had “been in the room” for ev­ery one of Mr Obama’s im­por­tant tran­si­tion meet­ings. But be­cause of coro­n­avirus so­cial dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions, Ms Har­ris has no such lux­ury, at least not in the phys­i­cal sense.</p>
    <p>After spend­ing elec­tion week in Delaware, she has re­turned to her two-bed­room Wash­ing­ton condo. From there, she is in reg­u­lar touch with Mr Bi­den, by text mes­sage or tele­phone, ac­cord­ing to aides with the Bi­den-Har­ris tran­si­tion team.</p>
    <p>One fo­cus of her time is the quan­tum leap that Ms Har­ris is soon to make from the leg­isla­tive to the ex­ec­u­tive branch.</p>
    <p>Whereas Mr Bi­den will have vir­tu­ally no learn­ing curve upon re­turn­ing to the White House after eight years as vice-pres­i­dent, Ms Har­ris has spent lit­tle, if any, sub­stan­tive time at 1600 Penn­syl­va­nia Ave.</p>
    <p>That process is made no eas­ier by Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s re­fusal to ac­knowl­edge the elec­tion re­sults and au­tho­rise an of­fi­cial tran­si­tion process in which Ms Har­ris and her aides would have ac­cess to White House of­fi­cials and doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris has not been con­tacted by her de­part­ing coun­ter­part, Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence.</p>
    <p>Days after the 2016 elec­tion, Mr Bi­den hosted Mr Pence for nearly two hours at the of­fi­cial vice-pres­i­den­tial com­pound at the US Naval Ob­ser­va­tory.</p>
    <p>Like Mr Bi­den, Ms Har­ris also has her own staff to build – an­other task po­ten­tially made more chal­leng­ing by her rel­a­tive lack of Wash­ing­ton ex­pe­ri­ence. While Mr Bi­den, after nearly 50 years in the cap­i­tal, has a net­work of hun­dreds of for­mer Se­nate and White House aides, Ms Har­ris has a smaller cir­cle, though she is ex­pected to hire sev­eral fa­mil­iar faces from her Se­nate of­fice and 2020 cam­paign.</p>
    <p>On so­cial me­dia, Ms Har­ris has stayed rig­or­ously on mes­sage, post­ing on Twit­ter sev­eral times about the coro­n­avirus and her de­ter­mi­na­tion to work with Mr Bi­den to con­tain it.</p>
    <p>“In just a few months, we will swear in a new pres­i­dent who is com­mit­ted to get­ting the pandemic un­der con­trol: @Joe­Biden,” she tweeted last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris has ven­tured out in the Wash­ing­ton area at least once since the elec­tion. On rainy Veter­ans Day, wear­ing blue jeans and a black rain­coat, she and her hus­band Dou­glas Emhoff dropped by Ge­orge­town’s Dog Tag Bak­ery, which was founded to help sup­port veter­ans. She has other­wise been out of sight at her condo build­ing.</p>
    <p>“No great thing is cre­ated sud­denly,” reads an in­scrip­tion on the build­ing, a quote from the Greek Stoic philoso­pher Epicte­tus.</p>
    <p>Mim­ick­ing a sad face, the server at the Blue­stone Lane cafe on the build­ing’s ground floor said he hoped she would visit again soon.</p>
