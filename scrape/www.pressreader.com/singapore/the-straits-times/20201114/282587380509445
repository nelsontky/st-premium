    <p>The game changer lifts, dares and ex­pands our vo­cab­u­lar­ies. Muham­mad Ali brought us “rope-a-dope” and cricket the he­li­copter shot. Ath­letes change the way we ap­proach a game – Barcelona and tiki-taka – and how far we can go. Yes, it is now pos­si­ble to slide on a hard court.</p>
    <p>Bryson DeCham­beau is a full-time golfer, ac­tive weightlift­er, part-time ag­i­ta­tor and earnest revo­lu­tion­ary, who is mak­ing golf clubs won­der if they need more land and lead­ing golfers to hitch up their sleeves to ex­am­ine their se­ri­ously in­suf­fi­cient bi­ceps.</p>
    <p>Damn, what has this dude done? Tiger Woods took golf re­luc­tantly to the weight room, but DeCham­beau is lead­ing them to an­other mus­cled land. The dis­tance be­tween him (344.4 yards) and the No. 2 (331.9) in the US PGA Tour’s driv­ing stats – 12.5 yards – is equiv­a­lent to the gap be­tween No. 2 and No. 10.</p>
    <p>Game chang­ers are bril­liant and an­noy­ing, for they force other ath­letes to im­prove yet also make them won­der: How did we not con­sider an idea so ut­terly sim­ple? Add 18kg of mus­cle and whack the ball into or­bit.</p>
    <p>For that mat­ter, how did no one think of prac­tis­ing ev­ery day for five years as Michael Phelps did? Which means if you only trained six days a week, he had a 52-day, an­nual head start over you. Phelps wanted “to change swim­ming” and this is what revo­lu­tion feels like. Hard, re­lent­less labour.</p>
    <p>Game chang­ers in­vent a tech­nique, al­ter di­ets and force a shift in think­ing. A girl from Prague who ini­tially loved junk food rewrote the man­ual on ath­leti­cism in ten­nis with her lung­ing, leap­ing beauty. Martina Navratilov­a’s mes­sage was get fit or take up check­ers. Else­where a school­boy foot­ball goal­keeper from In­dia al­tered the way teams chased down scores in 50-over cricket.</p>
    <p>M. S. Dhoni had a lum­ber­jack’s fore­arms but a tightrope walker’s nerve.</p>
    <p>Game chang­ers are fid­dlers and ex­per­i­menters, who stum­ble on ideas and re­fine them. Bri­ton John Trud­gen’s break­through stroke – de­scribed by the In­ter­na­tional Swim­ming Hall of Fame as “a side­stroke leg thrash that ac­com­mo­dates a turn onto the side with a breath­ing pause in the arm stroke” – was in fact learned from the na­tives of Ar­gentina.</p>
    <p>In­tel­li­gence is of­ten at the heart of change. Ed­win Moses, an ath­lete who earned an aca­demic schol­ar­ship, learnt – as he told CNN – pre­ci­sion move­ments from a room-mate who was a bal­let dancer and tried out ice baths “in the early 80s when ev­ery­one else thought it was crazy”.</p>
    <p>To his 400m hur­dling, Moses brought bi­ol­ogy, en­gi­neer­ing, physics and cu­rios­ity. So did Dick Fos­bury in the 1960s. The Port­land boy de­cided strad­dling a high jump bar wasn’t work­ing and so he went over it back­wards. It was so rad­i­cal an idea that a coach, ap­par­ently rather wryly, told The New York Times that if a trend be­gan,</p>
    <p>Fos­bury is “li­able to wipe out an en­tire gen­er­a­tion of high jumpers. They’ll all have bro­ken necks”. Not quite.</p>
    <p>You can’t see game chang­ers com­ing, but at kitchen ta­bles and at train­ing they count calo­ries and watch old film and reimag­ine what sport could be. There is a courage to the new idea, for one must con­sider how of­ten Si­mone Biles fell be­fore she mas­tered gym­nas­tic moves no one had done be­fore.</p>
    <p>The game changer lifts, dares and ex­pands our vo­cab­u­lar­ies. Muham­mad Ali brought us “rope-a-dope” and cricket the he­li­copter shot. Ath­letes change the way we ap­proach a game – Barcelona and tiki-taka – and how far we can go. Yes, it is now pos­si­ble to slide on a hard court.</p>
    <p>Speed and strength is the centre of most mod­ern change and when Sau­rav Ghosal, world No. 13 in squash, was asked about game chang­ers in his sport, he replied, “Ramy Ashour (the re­tired great), for el­e­vat­ing the pace of the game to an un­be­liev­able level.”</p>
    <p>This is where DeCham­beau is go­ing, tak­ing se­date golf into wild places. “Faster and stronger,” said the Amer­i­can at the Masters of his goal, ut­ter­ing two of the three words of the Olympic motto. Golf is more than mere length, but he is short­en­ing the game.</p>
    <p>Like a fel­low once did to pants. Bunny Austin, a ten­nis player dur­ing the 1920s and 30s, de­cided that cricket flan­nels were too sweaty and opted to play Wim­ble­don in a pair of shorts. No one fainted in the Royal Box at this his­toric change and ev­ery ten­nis player since owes him their thanks. Some­times, revo­lu­tion can be a breeze.</p>
