    <p>An ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence-pow­ered tool has been de­vel­oped to de­tect abnormal chest X-rays quickly dur­ing Covid-19 screen­ing at the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases (NCID).</p>
    <p>With rapid flag­ging of pneu­mo­nia cases, doc­tors can in­ter­vene ear­lier as more se­vere find­ings on chest X-rays may mean an ur­gent need for sup­ple­men­tal oxy­gen ther­apy and ven­ti­la­tion for pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Sus­pected Covid-19 pa­tients who have pneu­mo­nia must be ad­mit­ted to the hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­one who vis­its the NCID</p>
    <p>Screen­ing Cen­tre who is sus­pected of Covid-19 or who has res­pi­ra­tory symp­toms must do a chest X-ray.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, each X-ray im­age was re­viewed by a ra­di­ol­o­gist within an hour. The ra­di­ol­o­gists had to an­a­lyse each X-ray re­sult in se­quence, which was time-con­sum­ing.</p>
    <p>Now, the AI tool, called RadiLogic, can an­a­lyse each X-ray im­age within three sec­onds and high­light abnormal chest X-rays on a com­puter quickly, help­ing ra­di­ol­o­gists pri­ori­tise which im­ages to re­view. This al­lows ra­di­ol­o­gists to re­port such cases in about 50 min­utes, af­ter each pa­tient com­pletes the pro­ce­dure.</p>
    <p>The tool has an ac­cu­racy of up to 96.1 per cent, and has been used in the screen­ing cen­tre since May.</p>
    <p>The screen­ing cen­tre saw 200 to 300 X-ray im­ages a day dur­ing the peak of the pan­demic in April.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, there are 100 im­ages com­ing in each day.</p>
    <p>“The AI tool is per­form­ing close to hu­man ca­pa­bil­i­ties and it helps us pri­ori­tise the work­flow to en­hance our ef­fi­ciency and di­ag­nos­tic con­fi­dence,” said Ad­junct As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Tan Cher Heng, se­nior con­sul­tant at Tan Tock Seng Hospi­tal’s (TTSH) de­part­ment of di­ag­nos­tic ra­di­ol­ogy. He is also part of the team that de­vel­oped the tool.</p>
    <p>RadiLogic is not the first AI sys­tem for chest X-rays, but the team be­lieves that it is the first chest Xray AI tool de­vel­oped for Covid-19 in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Pro­grammed through deep learn</p>
    <p>ing, RadiLogic was fed with 1,000 anonymised abnormal chest Xrays from Covid-19 pa­tients and 4,000 anonymised normal chest X-rays to train it to de­tect pneu­mo­nia ac­cu­rately.</p>
    <p>White patches or hazi­ness over parts of the lungs in the X-ray im­age in­di­cate lung in­fec­tions and pneu­mo­nia. The big­ger the patches, the more se­ri­ous the in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The tool was de­vel­oped by ra­di­ol­o­gists from TTSH and re­searchers from the Agency for Science, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search’s In­sti­tute of High Per­for­mance Com­put­ing, and In­sti­tute for In­fo­comm Re­search.</p>
    <p>The team is hop­ing to de­ploy the tool to Covid-19 screen­ing sites such as com­mu­nity care fa­cil­i­ties and bor­der con­trol check­points, where ra­di­ol­o­gists are not on-site, and other hospi­tals such as Singa</p>
    <p>pore Gen­eral Hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>The team is also work­ing to en­hance the tool’s AI ca­pa­bil­i­ties in a few ways.</p>
    <p>One is to train the sys­tem to dis­tin­guish between Covid-19 pneu­mo­nia and other types of lung in­fec­tion, while an­other one is to zero in on abnormal re­gions and in­di­cate the prob­a­bil­ity of pneu­mo­nia.</p>
