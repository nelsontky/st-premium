    <p>TOKYO Ja­pan’s econ­omy sank deeper into its worst post-war con­trac­tion in the sec­ond quar­ter as the coro­n­avirus out­break j olted busi­nesses more than first thought, un­der­scor­ing the daunt­ing task the new prime min­is­ter faces in avert­ing a steeper re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>Other data has put that chal­lenge in per­spec­tive, with house­hold spend­ing and wages fall­ing in July as the im­pact of the pan­demic kept con­sump­tion frail even af­ter lock­down mea­sures were lifted in May.</p>
    <p>The world’s third-largest econ­omy shrank an an­nu­alised 28.1 per cent in the April-June pe­riod, more than a pre­lim­i­nary read­ing of a 27.8 per cent con­trac­tion, re­vised gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) data showed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The data will put the new prime min­is­ter, to be elected in a rul­ing party lead­er­ship race next Mon­day, un­der pres­sure to take bolder eco­nomic sup­port mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Chief Cab­i­net Sec­re­tary Yoshi­hide Suga, the front run­ner to be­come the next premier, has sig­nalled his readi­ness to boost spend­ing if he were to lead the coun­try.</p>
    <p>“The risk ahead is that the ef­fect of mea­sures taken so far, such as pay­outs to house­holds, will peter out,” econ­o­mist Koichi Fu­jishiro at Dai-ichi Life Re­search In­sti­tute said. “If Covid-19 weighs heav­ily on wages, the new ad­min­is­tra­tion could take ad­di­tional steps to help house­holds.”</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has so far un­veiled a US$2 tril­lion (S$2.7 tril­lion) pack­age of stim­u­lus mea­sures, adding to an en­hanced eas­ing pro­gramme from the Bank of Ja­pan (BOJ).</p>
    <p>Ja­pan re­cently recorded a re­newed rise in virus in­fec­tions but has been spared the kind of big ca­su­al­ties seen in Western coun­tries. To­tal in­fec­tions stood at 72,321 as of Mon­day, with 1,380 deaths, against a global tally of over 27 mil­lion cases and more than 888,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>The main cul­prit be­hind the down­ward GDP re­vi­sion was a 4.7 per cent drop in capital ex­pen­di­ture, much big­ger than a pre­lim­i­nary 1.5 per cent fall, sug­gest­ing the pan­demic was hit­ting broader sec­tors of the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“We can’t ex­pect capital ex­pen­di­ture to strengthen much ahead. Com­pa­nies won’t boost spend­ing when the out­look is so un­cer­tain,” said Mr Hiroshi Miyazaki, se­nior econ­o­mist at Mit­subishi UFJ Mor­gan Stan­ley Se­cu­ri­ties.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s econ­omy has shown some signs of life af­ter suf­fer­ing three straight quar­ters of con­trac­tion, with fac­tory out­put ris­ing in July at the fastest pace on record thanks to re­bound­ing de­mand for au­to­mo­biles.</p>
    <p>But sep­a­rate data yes­ter­day sug­gested that any re­cov­ery will likely be mod­est, as house­hold spend­ing fell a big­ger-than-ex­pected 7.6 per cent in July year on year, while real wages de­clined for the fifth straight month, point­ing to more pres­sure on con­sumer spend­ing.</p>
    <p>The health cri­sis has rav­aged a broad ar­ray of sec­tors, with firms such as au­tomaker Honda Motor fore­cast­ing a 68 per cent de­crease in an­nual op­er­at­ing profit.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts polled by Reuters last month said they ex­pect the econ­omy to shrink 5.6 per cent in the cur­rent fis­cal year to next March, and grow just 3.3 per cent the fol­low­ing year.</p>
    <p>The fresh batch of data will be among fac­tors the BOJ will scru­ti­nise at its rate re­view next week, when it is widely ex­pected to keep mon­e­tary set­tings un­changed.</p>
    <p>The cen­tral bank eased pol­icy twice this year to pump money to cash-strapped small firms, com­ple­ment­ing two big gov­ern­ment spend­ing pack­ages.</p>
    <p>The BOJ is widely ex­pected to hold off on ramp­ing up stim­u­lus for now as steps to spur de­mand could risk spread­ing the virus.</p>
    <p>“It will prob­a­bly take a long time for the econ­omy to nor­malise and re­turn to lev­els be­fore the pan­demic,” said chief econ­o­mist Yoshiki Shinke at Dai-ichi Life Re­search In­sti­tute.</p>
