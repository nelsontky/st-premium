    <p>He walks too slowly, a lan­guorous Hawai­ian am­bler. She’s a get-to-the-point woman, in gait and gab. He’s a politi­cian. She has no use for the type. He gets tan­gled up in fancy talk. She cuts through the fluff. He smoked. She loathes the smell of cig­a­rettes. Can this mar­riage be saved?</p>
    <p>We know, of course, that it can.</p>
    <p>We now have more than 1,100 pages on the ex­tra­or­di­nary lives of for­mer first cou­ple Michelle and Barack Obama, as told by them­selves.</p>
    <p>The two books – her Be­com­ing, pub­lished in 2018, and his A Promised Land, out last month – broke sales records, al­most sin­gle-hand­edly res­cu­ing the book­stores of North Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>The na­tional ground they cover, like the coun­try it­self, is vast: The big­gest fi­nan­cial cri­sis since the</p>
    <p>Great De­pres­sion. The heavy lift of ex­pand­ing health­care. The stone-cold bar­na­cle of Mr Mitch McCon­nell. Their own his­toric marker: the first black pres­i­dent and first lady.</p>
    <p>But be­hind their na­tional iden­ti­ties, there’s also the pri­vate love story, and scenes from a mar­riage just as com­pli­cated as any other.</p>
    <p>In­deed, long af­ter peo­ple stop won­der­ing how the Af­ford­able Care Act came to be, they’ll likely be read­ing the Oba­mas as a mar­riage tu­to­rial.</p>
    <p>Though he seems to get his way on his grand­est am­bi­tions, she fre­quently pushes back, saying their lives have to be about we, not me, or it won’t work.</p>
    <p>It’s been a long time, and is likely to be a long time com­ing, be­fore a mar­ried cou­ple from 1600 Penn­syl­va­nia Av­enue have as much to say about one of the cen­tral mys­ter­ies of life.</p>
    <p>I would have liked to have seen more of the in­te­rior life of the first lady Edith Wil­son, af­ter she es­sen­tially ran the ex­ec­u­tive branch fol­low­ing pres­i­dent Woodrow Wil­son’s stroke. And who doesn’t won­der what went on be­hind the sad gaze of the long-suf­fer­ing Pat Nixon?</p>
    <p>The Obama mar­riage, as they tell it, re­flects both the strains of their place in his­tory, and the con­tem­po­rary ag­gra­va­tions of pro­fes­sional strivers – the hard bal­anc­ing of dual ca­reers.</p>
    <p>Seem­ingly op­po­sites, Barack and Michelle ac­tu­ally com­plete each other. At times, her sub­tle snubs are just right, as when the pres­i­dent bolts out of bed early one morn­ing to re­ceive the news that he’s been awarded the No­bel Peace Prize. “That’s won­der­ful, honey,” she says, unim­pressed, then rolls over to get more sleep.</p>
    <p>He knows how lucky he was to find her, and how – at the peak of his power – he misses the bond from sim­pler times. He says: “There were nights when, ly­ing next to Michelle in the dark, I’d think about those days when every­thing be­tween us felt lighter, when her smile was more con­stant and our love less en­cum­bered.”</p>
    <p>Some­how, they de­fied the stereo­type of those liv­ing their vows in­side a po­lit­i­cal bub­ble – the wife with the ador­ing stare, the ab­sen­tee hus­band who only seems to care. What’s more, their de­scrip­tion of how the two be­came one and stayed that way seems, dare I say, au­then­tic.</p>
    <p>Here’s Michelle, a first-year lawyer by way of the south side of Chicago, Prince­ton and Har­vard Law School, on meet­ing, dis­miss­ing and then fall­ing in love with the man who walked into her of­fice one sum­mer day. She’d heard he was cute, smart and am­bi­tious. “I was scep­ti­cal of all of it. In my ex­pe­ri­ence, you put a suit on any half-in­tel­li­gent black man and white peo­ple tended to go bonkers.” And just to be clear: “He was re­fresh­ing, un­con­ven­tional, and weirdly el­e­gant. Not once, though, did I think about him as some­one I’d want to date.”</p>
    <p>But as sum­mer went on, she fell for his weird­ness and his wit, his tar­di­ness and his tran­quil­lity, and when the mys­tery tug at her heart be­came too strong to re­sist, she knew she was in trou­ble. “He was like a wind that threat­ened to un­set­tle every­thing,” she writes. She spends more than 50 pages in her mem­oir on the courtship.</p>
    <p>By con­trast, it takes Barack, a no­to­ri­ously lo­qua­cious man, a mere four pages in a book of more than 700 pages to get from meet­ing Michelle to their wed­ding day.</p>
    <p>Go­ing into pol­i­tics proved to be one of the big­gest sources of con­tention in their mar­riage. “We be­gan ar­gu­ing more, usu­ally late at night when the two of us were thor­oughly drained,” he writes. “‘This isn’t what I signed up for, Barack,’” says Michelle. “‘I feel like I’m do­ing it all by my­self.’”</p>
    <p>In­deed, like so many women, she made a con­sid­er­able sac­ri­fice of her own ca­reer to en­sure that the fam­ily they raised would be nor­mal, and to help Barack be­come the most pow­er­ful man in the world – some­thing he con­sis­tently ac­knowl­edges.</p>
    <p>His wife, ever the prag­ma­tist, and the more suc­cinct of the writ­ers, has the best ex­pla­na­tion of how they have stayed to­gether for nearly three decades: “What hap­pens when a soli­tude-lov­ing in­di­vid­u­al­ist mar­ries an out­go­ing fam­ily woman who does not love soli­tude one bit? The an­swer, I’m guess­ing, is prob­a­bly the best and most sus­tain­ing an­swer to nearly ev­ery ques­tion aris­ing in­side a mar­riage, no mat­ter who you are or what the is­sue is: You find ways to adapt. If you’re in it for­ever, there’s re­ally no choice.”</p>
