    <p>HONG KONG • Hang Seng In­dexes is con­sid­er­ing wide-rang­ing changes to Hong Kong’s stock bench­mark that would di­lute the in­flu­ence of its largest com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>The five pro­pos­als in­clude main­tain­ing “a cer­tain num­ber of con­stituents clas­si­fied as Hong Kong com­pa­nies”, ac­cord­ing to a 16-page con­sul­ta­tion pa­per re­leased on Tues­day. Hang Seng is also con­sid­er­ing in­creas­ing the num­ber of mem­bers to between 65 and 80, as well as cap­ping weight­ings at 8 per cent and fast-track­ing new listings.</p>
    <p>The in­dex cur­rently has 52 stocks with weight­ings lim­ited to 10 per cent. Se­condary listings or shares with un­equal vot­ing rights are capped at 5 per cent.</p>
    <p>The sweep­ing pro­pos­als come amid sig­nif­i­cant changes within the city’s stock mar­ket, as a wave of Chi­nese mega caps choose the fi­nan­cial hub as a pre­ferred venue to sell shares.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s bench­mark in­dex is near its low­est level ver­sus the MSCI World In­dex in 17 years, and the gauge’s abun­dance of old-econ­omy fi­nan­cial stocks has made it look out­dated in an age when China’s tech­nol­ogy gi­ants have in­creas­ing sway.</p>
    <p>“The ob­jec­tive of an in­dex is to rep­re­sent the lo­cal mar­ket, not the lo­cal econ­omy,” said Mr Kenny Wen, wealth-man­age­ment strate­gist at Ever­bright Sun Hung Kai. “So yes, the bench­mark will in­evitably lose its Hong Kong colour. The in­dex could have higher val­u­a­tions and greater volatil­ity if these changes lead to the in­clu­sion of more tech and health­care firms. It will be eas­ier to trade.”</p>
    <p>The Hang Seng In­dex started out in 1969 with 33 con­stituents, ris­ing to 38 in 2007 when it be­gan to in­clude H-share firms. In 2012, it ex­panded to 50, with the in­dex cov­er­ing roughly 60 per cent of the ag­gre­gate mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion at the time, a num­ber un­changed un­til this year. The pro­por­tion of main­land com­pa­nies in­creased to 79 per cent of the in­dex this year from 41.6 per cent in 2005, ac­cord­ing to Hang Seng’s con­sul­ta­tion pa­per.</p>
    <p>Hang Seng is so­lic­it­ing feed­back to the pro­pos­als till Jan 24. The changes would af­fect tens of bil­lions of dol­lars in pen­sion fund as­sets and ex­change-traded funds that track the in­dex.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s bench­mark in­dex is near its low­est level ver­sus the MSCI World In­dex in 17 years, and the gauge’s abun­dance of old-econ­omy fi­nan­cial stocks has made it look out­dated in an age when China’s tech­nol­ogy gi­ants have in­creas­ing sway.</p>
