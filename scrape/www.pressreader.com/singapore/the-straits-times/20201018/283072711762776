    <p>Vanessa Lim is of­ten ac­cused of be­ing “ki­asu” (Hokkien for fear of los­ing out), when it comes to man­ag­ing her money. The gen­eral man­ager of her father ’s fur­ni­ture busi­ness is cov­ered by 11 in­sur­ance poli­cies and saves half of her four-fig­ure salary ev­ery month.</p>
    <p>And she is only 30 years old.</p>
    <p>Yet, she notes, amid frail­ties and un­cer­tain­ties from the Covid-19 cri­sis, be­ing ki­asu is be­com­ing more praise­wor­thy than deroga­tory. The pan­demic jus­ti­fies her be­lief in be­ing pre­pared for sud­den shocks.</p>
    <p>About seven years ago, her close friend lost her hus­band to can­cer. He was in his late 30s.</p>
    <p>If not for a life in­sur­ance pay­out that she re­ceived upon her hus­band’s death, she would have been weighed down by the fi­nan­cial bur­den of his can­cer treat­ment.</p>
    <p>“That had a sig­nif­i­cant im­pact on me and I re­alised that we should never take things for granted,” says Ms Lim, who has had her share of per­sonal strug­gles too.</p>
    <p>Her father suf­fered a stroke when she was just 10 years old. Three years ago, her younger sis­ter sud­denly lost con­scious­ness — suf­fer­ing a split lip and bro­ken front teeth. In both in­stances, her fam­ily was able to de­fray large hos­pi­tal bills with med­i­cal and per­sonal ac­ci­dent in­sur­ance.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim has amassed an im­pres­sive port­fo­lio of in­sur­ance plans over the last eight years.</p>
    <p>She has one pol­icy each un­der five types of health-re­lated in­sur­ance: Hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion, life, crit­i­cal ill­ness, dis­abil­ity and per­sonal ac­ci­dent. Some cover the costs of med­i­cal treat­ments and pro­ce­dures, oth­ers pro­vide a lump-sum pay­out.</p>
    <p>Those are on top of MediShield Life and CareShield Life.</p>
    <p>“I’d rather pay now when I don’t have any pre-ex­ist­ing med­i­cal con­di­tions. Should I ever have to make a claim, I’ll be able to do so without any wor­ries.”</p>
    <p>All Sin­ga­pore­ans are cov­ered by MediShield Life (medishield­life.sg), a com­pul­sory ba­sic health in­sur­ance plan that sub­sidises the cost of treat­ment in pub­lic hos­pi­tals. CareShield Life (careshield­life.gov.sg), launched on Oct 1, pro­vides life­long monthly pay­outs in the event that the in­sured has a se­vere dis­abil­ity and re­quires long-term care.</p>
    <p>She and her hus­band, a re­search con­sul­tant who is also 30, are work­ing to­wards two mile­stones: Hav­ing a child and re­tir­ing by the age of 55. They were mar­ried last year and live in a four­room Hous­ing Board flat.</p>
    <p>They have three en­dow­ment poli­cies and plan to sign up for an­other to boost their sav­ings.</p>
    <p>I’d rather pay now when I don’t have any pre-ex­ist­ing med­i­cal con­di­tions. Should I ever have to make a claim, I’ll be able to do so without any wor­ries.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim sets aside about 25 per cent of her salary ev­ery month to pay for her in­sur­ance pre­mi­ums. She watches her spend­ing and gets by on a smaller bud­get than her friends.</p>
    <p>“It’s worth the ef­fort. I’ll see the ben­e­fits later on when, for ex­am­ple, I can use the pay­outs to fund my child’s ed­u­ca­tion.”</p>
    <p>For now, the cou­ple is also build­ing their nest egg with other in­vest­ment in­stru­ments and aims to set aside half of their re­spec­tive in­comes ev­ery month as sav­ings for their re­tire­ment goals.</p>
    <p>Says Ms Lim: “I would like to re­tire early and, most im­por­tantly, re­tire without worry. This means I have to start my fi­nan­cial plan­ning early so I have a longer lead time to build my sav­ings.”</p>
