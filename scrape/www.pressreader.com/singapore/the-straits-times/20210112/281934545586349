        <p>No one could have pre­dicted the scale and dis­rup­tion of Covid-19 in 2020.</p>
        <p>We now have 90 mil­lion cases and nearly two mil­lion deaths. Busi­ness and travel have been hit, and jobs lost. The pic­ture in East Asia has been rel­a­tively bet­ter, but there have still been sub­se­quent out­breaks. Our economies have not been spared.</p>
        <p>The out­look re­mains highly un­cer­tain. 2020 saw mas­sive gov­ern­ment stim­u­lus to sup­port jobs and busi­nesses. But this can­not con­tinue in­def­i­nitely, and we will need to find a more sus­tain­able path to re­cov­ery.</p>
        <p>Much will also de­pend on our col­lec­tive will to im­ple­ment ef­fec­tive na­tional in­ter­ven­tions, and col­lab­o­rate across bor­ders. 2021 be­gins with some hope. Vac­ci­na­tion programmes are be­gin­ning, and sci­en­tific co­op­er­a­tion has taken great strides in a short pe­riod of time. But the emer­gence of more in­fec­tious variants re­minds us that the fight is far from over.</p>
        <p>If the vac­cine roll-out is suc­cess­ful, and with con­tin­ued pol­icy stim­u­lus, we may see the be­gin­ning of global eco­nomic re­cov­ery in the sec­ond half of this year.</p>
        <p>Pan­demic in the age of glob­al­i­sa­tion</p>
        <p>This is not the first time the world has con­fronted a dev­as­tat­ing pan­demic. A cen­tury ago, the Span­ish Flu swept the globe. A third of the world be­came in­fected, and nearly 50 mil­lion peo­ple died.</p>
        <p>Back then, there was no co­or­di­nated global re­sponse. The sci­ence of vi­rol­ogy was far less de­vel­oped. So was our abil­ity to de­velop vac­cines. Ba­sic in­for­ma­tion shar­ing and in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion for the pan­demic was al­most non-ex­is­tent.</p>
        <p>It was only af­ter the Sec­ond World War that our present rules-based mul­ti­lat­eral sys­tem emerged.</p>
        <p>The United Na­tions and other in­sti­tu­tions were es­tab­lished. The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion</p>
        <p>(WHO) is one such in­sti­tu­tion. With­out it, small­pox, po­lio, Ebola, and even in­fluenza would be big­ger prob­lems.</p>
        <p>Our global or­der has laid the foun­da­tion for progress. Glob­al­i­sa­tion has pow­ered the world’s econ­omy for most of our life­times. How­ever, its fruits have not al­ways been evenly spread, within and across coun­tries. Un­hap­pi­ness over in­equal­ity has po­larised pol­i­tics in some places. Sup­port for global trade and in­te­gra­tion has weak­ened.</p>
        <p>But it is not use­ful to sim­ply re­ject the sys­tem whole­sale. On the con­trary, we need greater co­op­er­a­tion to adapt the rules-based mul­ti­lat­eral sys­tem and make it work bet­ter for all.</p>
        <p>We must ac­cept that there will be no re­turn to the pre-pan­demic era. It is up to us to chart the course towards a new nor­mal.</p>
        <p>Covid-19 has ac­cel­er­ated struc­tural shifts that were al­ready tak­ing place. Digital and tech­no­log­i­cal dis­rup­tion have ac­cel­er­ated. United States-China ten­sions have in­ten­si­fied, with no equi­lib­rium in sight. Global trad­ing rules have not kept pace with cur­rent re­al­i­ties.</p>
        <p>How­ever, the pan­demic has also given us com­mon cause to work to­gether.</p>
        <p>Early in the cri­sis, China’s sci­en­tists shared ge­netic data for the virus. This al­lowed the swift de­vel­op­ment of di­ag­nos­tic tests, in­clud­ing by Sin­ga­pore. In­sti­tu­tions are co­op­er­at­ing across bor­ders on treat­ments and vac­cines. One hun­dred and ninety economies are par­tic­i­pat­ing in the Covax Fa­cil­ity, which seeks to se­cure fair and eq­ui­table ac­cess to vac­cines for all.</p>
        <p>In short, through global co­op­er­a­tion, the world has an op­por­tu­nity to re­build and emerge stronger from this cri­sis.</p>
        <p>The great pow­ers: Com­pe­ti­tion, but also com­mon ground</p>
        <p>The US-China re­la­tion­ship is a key fac­tor shap­ing global co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
        <p>They are the world’s two largest economies, top spenders on de­fence, big­gest sources of in­ter­na­tional patents and top re­searchers, and two largest emit­ters of car­bon diox­ide.</p>
        <p>In many ways, we must be prepared for sharper com­pe­ti­tion be­tween them. There has been a fun­da­men­tal shift in at­ti­tudes – not only in the US, but also else­where. China is now re­garded as a strate­gic com­peti­tor.</p>
        <p>In the US, there is now bi­par­ti­san sup­port for a tougher stance on China. The in­com­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion will be tak­ing of­fice next week. But they may not re­verse some of the moves that the pre­vi­ous gov­ern­ment put in place.</p>
        <p>Strate­gic ri­valry will colour this re­la­tion­ship for a long time to come. There will be dis­agree­ment and fric­tion.</p>
        <p>De­spite this, they can still reach a more mea­sured tone of en­gage­ment, and greater pre­dictabil­ity in de­ci­sion-mak­ing.</p>
        <p>While the US and China will com­pete, con­flict is not in­evitable. Com­pe­ti­tion and co­op­er­a­tion can co-ex­ist. It is in the in­ter­est of both to re­main en­gaged with each other, and with the global sys­tem.</p>
        <p>There are chal­lenges that the US will not be able to man­age alone.</p>
        <p>China has been a ma­jor ben­e­fi­ciary of the global sys­tem since it un­der­took re­forms and its en­try into the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO) two decades ago.</p>
        <p>It is use­ful to re­mem­ber that even in the depths of the Cold War, a min­i­mal level of prac­ti­cal co­op­er­a­tion pre­vailed. As one ex­am­ple, the US and the Soviet Union worked to­gether through the WHO to erad­i­cate small­pox in the 1960s. Even in the con­tested area of space, the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz mis­sion de­vel­oped com­pat­i­ble ren­dezvous and dock­ing sys­tems, which re­mained in use for decades.</p>
        <p>The key is that both sides must take a ra­tio­nal view, and find com­mon ground. To com­pete when nec­es­sary, and co­op­er­ate wher­ever pos­si­ble.</p>
        <p>The cur­rent global or­der did not come about nat­u­rally. It was cre­ated through strong lead­er­ship and pur­pose­ful de­ci­sions. There is now an even greater im­per­a­tive for prag­ma­tism and co­op­er­a­tion, given how in­ter­con­nected and in­ter­de­pen­dent we are.</p>
        <p>There are early signs that the US and China could be will­ing to seek com­mon ground on some key global chal­lenges like cli­mate change and pub­lic health. Much will de­pend on whether they are able to find a frame­work for co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
        <p>Asia’s prospects</p>
        <p>The state of US-China re­la­tions will have a sig­nif­i­cant bear­ing on our re­gion.</p>
        <p>Asia’s share of global gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) has been grow­ing steadily. It is pro­jected to re­cover faster than the rest of the world, and will con­trib­ute 60 per cent of global growth by 2030.</p>
        <p>But an Asian cen­tury is nei­ther in­evitable nor fore­or­dained. Eco­nomic re­cov­ery will be un­even across coun­tries. Di­vi­sive, tit-for-tat com­pe­ti­tion be­tween the US and China may also im­pact growth.</p>
        <p>To se­cure the re­gion’s po­ten­tial and ad­dress risks, lead­ers need to work to­gether to take ac­tion.</p>
        <p>One ex­am­ple was the sign­ing of the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive</p>
        <p>Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship last year. This was ini­ti­ated by Asean nine years ago, well be­fore US-China ten­sions over trade emerged. It showed how we could catal­yse re­gional co­op­er­a­tion in con­crete ways. We con­tinue to wel­come In­dia’s par­tic­i­pa­tion when it de­cides the time is right.</p>
        <p>An­other ex­am­ple was the con­clu­sion of the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship (CPTPP). Be­yond re­duc­ing costs for busi­ness, the CPTPP will help safe­guard in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty rights, and high labour and en­vi­ron­men­tal stan­dards across the re­gion. The door re­mains open for the US and other like-minded part­ners to join.</p>
        <p>Th­ese re­gional part­ner­ships are not exclusive re­gional eco­nomic blocs. They are build­ing blocks that can en­hance ca­pac­ity and con­fi­dence towards broader global in­te­gra­tion.</p>
        <p>Asean cen­tral­ity and co­op­er­a­tion</p>
        <p>Within South-east Asia, the fun­da­men­tals for growth are strong. We have a grow­ing mid­dle class and a fast-grow­ing digital econ­omy. We are in a good po­si­tion to ben­e­fit from the re­con­fig­u­ra­tion of sup­ply chains.</p>
        <p>Both the US and China’s ac­tive pres­ence are im­por­tant for Asean to progress. The US’ pres­ence un­der­pins re­gional sta­bil­ity, which cre­ates a hos­pitable en­vi­ron­ment for busi­ness and in­vest­ments. Amer­i­can in­vest­ments also drive many key in­dus­tries.</p>
        <p>China has deep eco­nomic in­ter­de­pen­dence with Asean. It is now the largest trad­ing part­ner for eight Asean coun­tries, and Asean has over­taken the Euro­pean Union to be­come China’s largest trad­ing part­ner.</p>
        <p>Asean has and will con­tinue to feel the tug of US-China com­pe­ti­tion. We can­not de­ter­mine the tra­jec­tory of this con­test, but we can stand to­gether to ad­vance Asean’s col­lec­tive in­ter­ests.</p>
        <p>And Asean’s in­ter­ests must be de­fined by Asean, not by oth­ers who seek to de­fine them for us. It is not a ques­tion of choos­ing sides, but rather, re­tain­ing our abil­ity to make choices for our­selves.</p>
        <p>To safe­guard our in­de­pen­dence and agency, our re­gion must re­main an­chored on Asean Cen­tral­ity. Asean must play a proac­tive and cen­tral role in en­gag­ing ex­ter­nal part­ners, al­ways work­ing in­clu­sively and prag­mat­i­cally, and tran­scend­ing dis­agree­ments be­tween ex­ter­nal pow­ers.</p>
        <p>One ex­am­ple is the ne­go­ti­a­tion of a Code of Con­duct in the South China Sea, which will help keep our re­gion open, and avoid mis­cal­cu­la­tion and mis­un­der­stand­ing.</p>
        <p>Within Asean, we must con­tinue to sup­port one an­other. Asean’s great­est suc­cess has been to main­tain peace in a very di­verse re­gion, which has his­tor­i­cally been in con­flict among our­selves.</p>
        <p>Five decades on, in the mid­dle of a global pan­demic, many of us do­nated test kits and equip­ment to one an­other, and helped each other repa­tri­ate cit­i­zens stuck over­seas.</p>
        <p>De­spite the pan­demic, we have pressed on with the Asean Eco­nomic Com­mu­nity Blue­print 2025. Trade has con­tin­ued, and goods still move across bor­ders. Un­der Brunei’s chair­man­ship this year, we will con­tinue to strengthen re­silience and deepen co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
        <p>Global co­op­er­a­tion: A way for­ward</p>
        <p>At the broader level, global co­op­er­a­tion will be es­pe­cially im­por­tant as we seek to exit the pan­demic and re­build. Let me high­light three im­por­tant ar­eas.</p>
        <p>1</p>
        <p>PUB­LIC HEALTH CO­OP­ER­A­TION</p>
        <p>First, in pub­lic health. The Covax Fa­cil­ity is a ma­jor step in the right di­rec­tion. With vac­cines au­tho­rised for use and in mass pro­duc­tion, the next step is to work to­gether to trans­port them swiftly and safely, and dis­trib­ute them eq­ui­tably.</p>
        <p>A fur­ther step is safe re­sump­tion of the move­ment of peo­ple, by es­tab­lish­ing com­mon pro­to­cols and stan­dards for safe in­ter­na­tional travel.</p>
        <p>In the longer term, we need to strengthen our col­lec­tive re­sponse to fu­ture pan­demics. Dis­ease X is not a mat­ter of if, but when.</p>
        <p>We must lock in and strengthen the un­prece­dented level of in­for­ma­tion ex­change – in sci­ence, re­search and best prac­tices.</p>
        <p>Pub­lic health co­op­er­a­tion can also ex­pand be­yond pan­demic re­sponse. Col­lab­o­ra­tion on health­care in­no­va­tion will en­hance the re­silience and ef­fec­tive­ness of our health­care sys­tems. Sev­eral so­ci­eties have age­ing pop­u­la­tions, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore. We can co­op­er­ate on re­search and the shar­ing of ex­pe­ri­ences, to en­able our se­niors to stay healthy and ac­tive for as long as pos­si­ble.</p>
        <p>2</p>
        <p>CLI­MATE CHANGE</p>
        <p>The sec­ond area for global co­op­er­a­tion is cli­mate change, which af­fects all coun­tries, es­pe­cially small is­land states like Sin­ga­pore.</p>
        <p>We need a global ef­fort, and mul­ti­lat­eral so­lu­tions. So I am glad that the US will be recom­mit­ting to the Paris Agree­ment.</p>
        <p>This is also an area where co­op­er­a­tion in sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy can pro­pel us towards a green re­cov­ery.</p>
        <p>In­no­va­tion and tech­nol­ogy can of­fer so­lu­tions to achieve both eco­nomic growth and sus­tain­abil­ity. There is great po­ten­tial to im­prove re­source ef­fi­ciency for en­ergy, wa­ter and food pro­duc­tion, de­velop na­ture-based so­lu­tions for cli­mate change, and em­ploy bio­philic de­sign to build greener, more sus­tain­able and live­able cities.</p>
        <p>3</p>
        <p>DIGITAL GOV­ER­NANCE</p>
        <p>A third area is in digital gov­er­nance.</p>
        <p>The digital rev­o­lu­tion was well un­der way be­fore Covid, and sped up dur­ing the cri­sis as life shifted on­line. But global norms and rules in cy­berspace have not been fully worked out.</p>
        <p>As tech­nol­ogy be­comes ever more per­va­sive in our daily lives, cy­ber se­cu­rity will be even more crit­i­cal.</p>
        <p>In­ter­na­tional col­lab­o­ra­tion is cru­cial to main­tain­ing a safer and se­cure cy­berspace. We will also need stronger tech gov­er­nance, to en­sure that tech­nol­ogy pro­gresses in a fair and eth­i­cal man­ner.</p>
        <p>For ex­am­ple, Sin­ga­pore is a found­ing mem­ber of the Global Part­ner­ship on Ar­ti­fi­cial In­tel­li­gence. This in­ter­na­tional ini­tia­tive was started last year to sup­port the re­spon­si­ble use of AI, data gov­er­nance and how AI can be used to em­power work­ers.</p>
        <p>As digital trade grows, we will also need com­mon stan­dards to en­able trusted data flows across bor­ders.</p>
        <p>There is an on­go­ing ef­fort by a group of WTO mem­bers to up­date global trade rules to fa­cil­i­tate digital trade. The G-20 is also look­ing at im­por­tant is­sues like the free flow of data and cy­ber se­cu­rity.</p>
        <p>Sin­ga­pore has pur­sued Digital Econ­omy Agree­ments with our part­ners, to de­velop new ap­proaches for the cross-bor­der digital econ­omy, such as e-pay­ment across ju­ris­dic­tions.</p>
        <p>As with trade, such agree­ments build a com­mon frame­work for progress, es­pe­cially in this new and rapidly evolv­ing field.</p>
        <p>Covid-19 has brought us to a cross­roads. The forces of change will take their course, whether we act or not. If we do not come to­gether to tackle th­ese com­mon chal­lenges, we will be headed towards a more frac­tious, more un­equal world. Our planet will be less hab­it­able... Covid-19 has given us com­mon cause to work to­gether. Let us build on the mo­men­tum of co­op­er­a­tion from this cri­sis, to make the best of this mo­ment, and lay the foun­da­tion for a more re­silient, more sus­tain­able and more vi­brant fu­ture.</p>
        <p>It will not be easy. Covid has laid bare many of our vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties. But we can take small con­crete steps, es­pe­cially in the ar­eas I have just high­lighted.</p>
        <p>Each coun­try will also need to adapt how it works ex­ter­nally with oth­ers – in an open and more in­clu­sive way.</p>
        <p>At home, each coun­try will need to un­der­take struc­tural re­forms, to build new com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tages to ben­e­fit from glob­al­i­sa­tion, and to en­sure that so­cial poli­cies are sus­tain­able.</p>
        <p>If we suc­ceed, each coun­try can grow new strengths and com­ple­ment one an­other, achiev­ing more to­gether than we could on our own, and giv­ing us a stake in one an­other’s suc­cess.</p>
        <p>Sin­ga­pore’s place in the world</p>
        <p>Now, what do all th­ese mean for Sin­ga­pore?</p>
        <p>As a small coun­try, our open­ness un­der­pins our eco­nomic suc­cess. To­day, trade is three times our GDP. We are also a global trans­port, man­u­fac­tur­ing and fi­nan­cial node. If we close up, we will soon lose our value and rel­e­vance to the world. This is why, even with Covid-19, we are ac­tively look­ing for ways to re­open safely, while re­main­ing vig­i­lant.</p>
        <p>Be­ing small and open means we feel the tugs of ex­ter­nal events more keenly, es­pe­cially as the mul­ti­lat­eral sys­tem comes un­der pres­sure. Even so, be­ing small has its ad­van­tages. We can be more adapt­able, flex­i­ble and in­no­va­tive in tap­ping op­por­tu­ni­ties brought about by global co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
        <p>In cli­mate change, Sin­ga­pore is putting sus­tain­abil­ity at the core of what we do.</p>
        <p>Cli­mate change is an ex­is­ten­tial threat for Sin­ga­pore, but can also create new op­por­tu­ni­ties. For ex­am­ple, through in­ter­na­tional sci­en­tific col­lab­o­ra­tion, we are deep­en­ing our un­der­stand­ing of cli­mate sci­ence, es­pe­cially for a highly ur­ban en­vi­ron­ment like Sin­ga­pore.</p>
        <p>We are also de­vel­op­ing cre­ative so­lu­tions to de­car­bonise our econ­omy, in­clud­ing car­bon-cap­ture util­i­sa­tion and stor­age, and low-car­bon hy­dro­gen.</p>
        <p>As a global fi­nan­cial hub, we can also con­trib­ute to a green re­cov­ery in Asia. For ex­am­ple, we are ex­plor­ing how we can serve the re­gion as a mar­ket­place for high-qual­ity car­bon cred­its and pro­vide tech­nol­ogy-en­abled ver­i­fi­ca­tion sys­tems for car­bon so­lu­tions.</p>
        <p>As the world grows ever more digital, the tech sec­tor is also a bright spot for busi­nesses and work­ers in Sin­ga­pore. We will con­tinue to grow our tech and start-up eco-sys­tem, and nur­ture uni­corns like Sea and Grab.</p>
        <p>We will con­tinue to in­vest in in­no­va­tion, deepen our ca­pa­bil­i­ties in tech­nolo­gies like AI, which al­ready has wide­spread ap­pli­ca­tions, and de­velop emer­gent ar­eas like quan­tum com­put­ing.</p>
        <p>We will also con­tinue to grow our part­ner­ships with tech gi­ants from around the world.</p>
        <p>But our abil­ity to make the best of th­ese op­por­tu­ni­ties and our rel­e­vance to the world ul­ti­mately de­pends on our strengths at home.</p>
        <p>As we strive to re­main open and grow, we must en­sure that the ben­e­fits of growth are spread more eq­ui­tably.</p>
        <p>We do so by help­ing our busi­nesses to trans­form, while at­tract­ing more com­pa­nies to set up op­er­a­tions here. We are also in­vest­ing sig­nif­i­cantly to bring out the best in our peo­ple, while com­ple­ment­ing our work­force with ex­per­tise from abroad.</p>
        <p>Above all, we must con­tinue to strengthen na­tional sol­i­dar­ity, and push back against the divi­sion and po­lar­i­sa­tion seen else­where. We must con­tinue to grow what we have in com­mon, and deepen our shared com­mit­ment to do what is right for the longer term.</p>
        <p>The stronger we are at home, the more we can con­trib­ute to the global com­mons and create op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
        <p>Con­clu­sion</p>
        <p>Covid-19 has given the world a sharp shock. But it has also given us com­mon cause to work to­gether.</p>
        <p>A decade from now, in the 20th edi­tion of the ST Global Out­look, I hope we can say that while Covid-19 was a dark chap­ter, the world was able to rally to­gether and turn the page, lay­ing the foun­da­tion for a more re­silient, sus­tain­able and dy­namic fu­ture.</p>
