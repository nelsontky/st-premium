    <p>In­stead of go­ing down aisles serv­ing food, some cur­rent and for­mer cabin crew are now work­ing be­hind the stove, mak­ing it.</p>
    <p>For­mer Sin­ga­pore Girl Ce­line Ho, 27, for ex­am­ple, re­signed in April and is now a co-founder of Ce­line’s Ge­lato, a cafe which sells Ital­ianstyle ice cream in flavours such as black sesame, yuzu sor­bet and durian.</p>
    <p>It is l ocated at the mixed devel­op­ment Novena Re­gency.</p>
    <p>She says: “I run my cafe just as if I am serv­ing pas­sen­gers on board a flight. I think my train­ing at Sin­ga­pore Air­lines has re­ally helped me in my cur­rent busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“I still use the com­mu­ni­ca­tion and ser­vice skills, as well as the abil­ity to mul­ti­task, solve prob­lems and work un­der pres­sure ev­ery day.”</p>
    <p>Nowa­days, when a cus­tomer asks for a flavour that has run out, she swiftly of­fers an al­ter­na­tive. When all her cafe’s 13 seats are oc­cu­pied, she asks new cus­tomers if they would like to browse through the menu while wait­ing, or or­der to go.</p>
    <p>And when guests ap­pear to be look­ing for the toi­let or carpark, she proac­tively ap­proaches them to help.</p>
    <p>In­deed, it was fly­ing that helped build her vast knowl­edge of the icecold treat. It gave her the op­por­tu­nity to taste some of the best ge­lato in Mi­lan, Italy, which she has vis­ited about 10 times.</p>
    <p>Tast­ing dif­fer­ent types of sweet treats around the world – from pat­bingsu in South Korea to mochi ice cream in Ja­pan to salted caramel soft-serve ice cream in Lon­don – helped to refine her palate and hone a win­ning recipe to start a busi­ness with.</p>
    <p>For Mr Tan Wei Chang, 27, a cur­rent flight stew­ard at SilkAir, his pas­sion for bak­ing cakes since he was young led him to start his own home-based bak­ing busi­ness, 31choc, which sells prod­ucts such as durian on­deh on­deh cake, sea salt Nutella tarts and sea salt cho­co­late cook­ies.</p>
    <p>A few days after sell­ing each cake, he con­tacts the cus­tomer to ask for feed­back on the cake, and uses this feed­back to fine-tune his recipes. In this way, he hopes to im­prove on his busi­ness’ of­fer­ings.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing in SilkAir has taught us to be adapt­able in dif­fer­ent sit­u­a­tions. So no mat­ter how chal­leng­ing the sit­u­a­tion is, we will han­dle it calmly and with em­pa­thy, grace and dig­nity,” he says.</p>
    <p>His col­league, Ms Nor Az­izah Ibrahim, 42, a se­nior flight stew­ardess at SilkAir, has also started a home­based Malay food busi­ness, Z.kookt, which sells dishes such as kueh mak­mur, pineap­ple tarts and ayam masak merah.</p>
    <p>She says she main­tains the same at­ten­tion to de­tail and stan­dards of hy­giene when cook­ing food for her cus­tomers as when she was fly­ing.</p>
    <p>And just as she did when she was in the air, she has also per­formed “ser­vice re­cov­er­ies” in busi­ness.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, an irate cus­tomer once con­tacted her about a miss­ing or­der of chicken ren­dang. Ms Az­izah quickly apol­o­gised and gave a full re­fund.</p>
    <p>She then fol­lowed up by cook­ing the chicken ren­dang and de­liv­er­ing it as soon as pos­si­ble as a good­will ges­ture.</p>
    <p>“The cus­tomer was i mpressed by the prompt ser­vice,” Ms Az­izah adds proudly.</p>
