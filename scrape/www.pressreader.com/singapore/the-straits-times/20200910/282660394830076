    <p>NEW YORK • When the coro­n­avirus pan­demic struck, even the most en­thu­si­as­tic cooks had to ad­just to a new, more com­pli­cated re­la­tion­ship with their kitchens.</p>
    <p>For the first time in a gen­er­a­tion, Amer­i­cans be­gan spend­ing more money at the su­per­mar­ket than at places where some­one else made the food. Gro­cers saw eight years of pro­jected sales growth packed into one month. Shop­ping trends that were in their in­fancy were tur­bocharged.</p>
    <p>Here are seven ways the pan­demic has changed the way Amer­i­cans shop for food.</p>
    <p>1. Trips are fewer, lists are bet­ter</p>
    <p>The need to avoid in­fec­tion has taught peo­ple how to get by on fewer trips to the store and to make good shop­ping lists.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple now go to the store with pur­pose,” said Mr John Owen, as­so­ciate di­rec­tor for food and re­tail of mar­ket anal­y­sis group Min­tel. “The num­ber of trips went way down and the size of the bas­ket went way up in April. We have eased back on that, but not by much.”</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pan­demic, 19 per cent of Amer­i­cans shopped for food more than three times a week, ac­cord­ing to a study by man­age­ment firm McKin­sey & Co. That num­ber had dropped to 10 per cent by June.</p>
    <p>2. On­line aisles are bustling</p>
    <p>A year ago, 81 per cent of shop­pers sur­veyed by Gallup said they never turned to the In­ter­net for gro­ceries. On­line shop­ping was lolling at around 3 per cent of all gro­cery sales, or about US$1.2 bil­lion (S$1.6 bil­lion), ac­cord­ing to a sur­vey by Brick Meets Click/Mer­ca­tus.</p>
    <p>But in June, on­line gro­cery sales in the United States hit US$7.2 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Curb­side pick-up, de­liv­ery’s sib­ling, has also ex­ploded. Stores are con­vert­ing carparks to bet­ter han­dle traf­fic from shop­pers who drive by to pick up or­ders.</p>
    <p>3. Or­ange is the new snack</p>
    <p>Pro­duce sales have been rid­ing high since March and are still up 11 per cent from a year ear­lier, said Mr Joe Wat­son, vice-pres­i­dent at the Pro­duce Mar­ket­ing As­so­ci­a­tion. But one item is a real out­lier: or­anges.</p>
    <p>In May, gro­cers sold 73 per cent more or­anges than dur­ing the same month last year. Even into July, sales re­mained 52 per cent higher than a year be­fore.</p>
    <p>“Or­anges were a sur­prise, but they are pop­u­lar from an im­mu­nity stand­point,” Mr Wat­son said.</p>
    <p>They also last longer than some other fruit, which mat­ters when peo­ple are go­ing to the store less of­ten, he said.</p>
    <p>4.Re­draw­ing the store</p>
    <p>Pan­demic shop­ping has ush­ered in wider aisles, new meth­ods of san­i­ta­tion and less-crowded stores. Health con­cerns have also sped up the growth in pay­ment apps and self-check­out.</p>
    <p>Re­tail gi­ant Wal­mart is test­ing a new sys­tem that re­places tra­di­tional check­out lines with an open plaza ringed by 34 ter­mi­nals. Shop</p>
    <p>pers can scan their pur­chases or ask an em­ployee to do the scan­ning for them.</p>
    <p>5. Choices are shrink­ing</p>
    <p>Af­ter decades in which Amer­i­can su­per­mar­kets ex­panded to of­fer a dizzy­ing se­lec­tion of prod­ucts and brands, they are pulling back on va­ri­ety.</p>
    <p>There are no more free sam­ples (a health risk) and fewer spe­cial­ity pro­mo­tions. Shop­pers, in­tent on get­ting in and out quickly, are stick­ing to items they al­ready know.</p>
    <p>Gro­cers have found that they can still do a brisk busi­ness with fewer choices. By re­duc­ing choices, stores can more eas­ily surf the ups and downs of the sup­ply chain, which are also lim­it­ing what is avail­able.</p>
    <p>6. The freezer is hot</p>
    <p>Frozen food is an­other sur­prise break­out. Sales ini­tially jumped by 94 per cent in March from a year ear­lier, ac­cord­ing to the Amer­i­can Frozen Food In­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>For some con­sumers, frozen fruit and veg­eta­bles be­came a less ex­pen­sive and more re­li­able al­ter­na­tive to fresh. And then there was a sim­ple re­al­ity: Some days it is just eas­ier to pull a meal from the freezer.</p>
    <p>7. ‘Lo­cal’ is a big­ger lure</p>
    <p>The fragility of the sup­ply chain, con­cerns over health and safety and an ap­pre­ci­a­tion of com­mu­nity have buoyed the move­ment to­wards food that is raised or pro­duced lo­cally.</p>
    <p>Gro­cers are team­ing up with chefs to sell meal kits. Lo­cally grown pro­duce is sell­ing out quickly. It is all part of a greater aware­ness of food waste and cli­mate change.</p>
