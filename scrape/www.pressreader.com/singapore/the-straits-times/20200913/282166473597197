    <p>It is 5am at Changi Beach. The tide is out and dawn is nowhere in sight.</p>
    <p>I meet Mr Den­nis Chan, 26, who hands me a torch. Mr Chan, the founder of The Un­tamed Paths, which pro­vides lo­cal wildlife tours, is my guide for the day.</p>
    <p>We are ex­plor­ing the in­ter­tidal zone, the part of the coast that is sub­merged at high tide and ex­posed dur­ing low tide. We walk 50m away from the shore­line, sink­ing an­kle-deep in some places.</p>
    <p>The shal­lows are teem­ing. Sil­ver fishes dart in 5cm of sea­wa­ter, while white terns flit like ghosts above them.</p>
    <p>There are shell-steal­ing her­mit crabs, pur­ple-tinged moon crabs and baby flower crabs that may grow up des­tined for seafood restau­rant menus.</p>
    <p>There are hun­dreds of tiny sea snails, which look like ball bear­ings that have sud­denly started to wrig­gle and squirm.</p>
    <p>It is as if I have dis­cov­ered a se­cret planet at my feet.</p>
    <p>One won­ders, how­ever, why Mother Na­ture has to be quite so weird. There seem to be too many squishy blobs like sea anemones and sea squirts.</p>
    <p>Un­like its dull, con­form­ist peers, the pink warty sea cu­cum­ber is decked in a trippy com­bi­na­tion of hot pink and banana yel­low.</p>
    <p>I had not re­alised be­fore that Sin­ga­pore is an ap­par­ent hot­bed for bizarre wildlife.</p>
    <p>Chief among th­ese is the colugo, an elu­sive glid­ing mam­mal that I en­counter on an­other guided walk with Mr Chan, this time at night in</p>
    <p>Bukit Ba­tok Na­ture Park.</p>
    <p>The sunda colugo, a na­tive of ma­ture forests in Sin­ga­pore, has a gi­ant mem­brane called a patag­ium, which stretches from its face to its dig­its to its tail. If it were a su­per­hero, it would be all cape and a pair of bug eyes.</p>
    <p>This out­sized skin flap helps the noc­tur­nal crit­ter – whose other odd­ball qual­i­ties in­clude hav­ing teeth shaped like a comb – glide long dis­tances from tree to tree.</p>
    <p>To get the most of any na­ture walk, look out for “sub­tle noises and move­ments”, Mr Chan ad­vises.</p>
    <p>He points out an Asian toad, whose brush against a blade of grass is be­yond my hear­ing range.</p>
    <p>Sud­denly, he looks up into the trees. Ever the Muggle gawk­ing at his Dum­ble­dore pow­ers of ob­ser­va­tion, all I see is a tree branch un­til he points to what looks like a de­flated brown plas­tic bag hang­ing off it.</p>
    <p>The colugo’s “body l an­guage” shows it’s about to “fly”, he whis­pers.</p>
    <p>Our pho­tog­ra­pher gets into po­si­tion just in time: the colugo spreads its mem­brane, re­veal­ing an un­sus­pected baby cling­ing un­der­neath, and shoots like a mis­sile to a nearby tree. It takes an elec­tri­fy­ing sec­ond.</p>
    <p>While the early hours at the coast im­part a sense of zen, wildlifesp­ot­ting at night is edgier.</p>
    <p>The air is muggy and heavy with ex­pectancy. The an­i­mals are awake and ac­tive, if only I could see them. I am not sure I want full night vi­sion, though; I am a lit­tle afraid of snakes.</p>
    <p>We head off to Up­per Sele­tar Reser­voir Park. The night sky, with its gib­bous moon, is the bright­est spot in the dark­ened for­est.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan stops by a log next to the sandy path. He whips out an ul­tra­vi­o­let light, which shows scor­pi­ons glow­ing blue, their men­ac­ing tails curled up.</p>
    <p>Who knew that all scor­pi­ons fluoresce un­der UV light? It is the witch­ing hour, af­ter all, and I have learnt that there is plenty of magic in the sci­ence in our own back­yard.</p>
