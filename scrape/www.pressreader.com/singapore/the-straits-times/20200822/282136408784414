    <p>A man rode an un­reg­is­tered es­cooter against the flow of traf­fic in Selegie Road last Oc­to­ber and struck a pedes­trian, caus­ing her to suf­fer a frac­tured skull.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim, Ms Shi Xueqi, 24, also had sub­du­ral haematoma, a con­di­tion where blood col­lects be­tween the skull and the sur­face of the brain.</p>
    <p>Although she was dis­charged three days later, the court heard that she con­tin­ues to ex­pe­ri­ence oc­ca­sional gid­di­ness.</p>
    <p>E-scooter rider Chen Yue, 61, was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to six weeks’ jail and a fine of $500.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese national had pleaded guilty to one count each of rid­ing an un­reg­is­tered e-scooter and caus­ing griev­ous hurt to Ms Shi by rid­ing the de­vice in a rash man­ner.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tor Grace Teo said that Chen bought the es­cooter last Septem­ber and knew that he had to reg­is­ter it.</p>
    <p>He did not do so, as he wanted to sell the de­vice.</p>
    <p>At about 4pm on Oct 23 last year, he was rid­ing the e-scooter on a foot­path in Selegie Road on his way to meet a po­ten­tial buyer when he no­ticed that there were many pedes­tri­ans in the vicin­ity.</p>
    <p>He de­cided to ride the e-scooter against the flow of traf­fic on the road at a speed of around 15kmh.</p>
    <p>Ms Shi stepped off the foot­path about 10 min­utes later to cross the road when the de­vice slammed into her, caus­ing her to fall.</p>
    <p>The prose­cu­tor said: “(Chen) stopped the (de­vice) on the right side of the road and looked back, where­upon he saw the vic­tim ly­ing face down on the road, bleed­ing from her mouth and face.</p>
    <p>“He car­ried her to the side of the road and onto the foot­path. A crowd of pedes­tri­ans gath­ered, and one of them called for an am­bu­lance. The ac­cused stayed un­til the po­lice ar­rived.”</p>
    <p>Ms Shi was taken to hos­pi­tal, and a med­i­cal re­port from the National Neu­ro­science In­sti­tute later stated that she had sub­du­ral haematoma and a frac­tured skull.</p>
    <p>She was dis­charged on Oct 26 last year and given 31 days of hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion leave.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the court heard that her med­i­cal fees were fully cov­ered by in­sur­ance.</p>
    <p>Chen also made a vol­un­tary com­pen­sa­tion of $8,000 to her on May 4.</p>
    <p>For caus­ing griev­ous hurt to Ms Shi by rid­ing his e-scooter in a rash man­ner, he could have been jailed for up to four years and fined up to $10,000.</p>
