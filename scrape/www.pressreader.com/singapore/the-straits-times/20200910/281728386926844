    <p>Test­ing seniors to de­ter­mine if they have been i nfected with Covid-19 needs to be done in a tar­geted and ra­tio­nal man­ner in­stead of just test­ing all of them.</p>
    <p>But the multi-min­istry task force will con­tinue to keep an eye on them, as more se­nior-cen­tric ac­tiv­i­ties started to re­sume yes­ter­day, said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ken­neth Mak, di­rec­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices at the Health Min­istry.</p>
    <p>He ex­plained that var­i­ous test­ing regimes and sur­veil­lance have been put in place in dif­fer­ent ways. For in­stance, the task force is pilot­ing the use of waste­water test­ing in some nurs­ing homes to find out if there are any pos­si­ble signs of cryp­tic in­fec­tion in that set­ting.</p>
    <p>“So far we have not found any,” Prof Mak said.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, test­ing was also con­ducted among res­i­dents in nurs­ing homes only to find that there was no sig­nif­i­cant com­mu­nity spread of Covid-19 there, he added.</p>
    <p>He stressed that the task force will be keep­ing a close watch on this, es­pe­cially with the grad­ual open­ing-up of nurs­ing homes and hos­pi­tals to vis­i­tors, which could ex­pose vul­ner­a­ble seniors to the virus.</p>
    <p>Se­nior ac­tiv­ity cen­tres will also be closely watched to de­ter­mine if there is a need to ex­tend mon­i­tor­ing be­yond just the health of par­tic­i­pat­ing seniors, he added.</p>
    <p>“We want to make sure that there’s some level of ra­tio­nal­is­ing of the dif­fer­ent forms of sur­veil­lance that we’re do­ing for all these seniors.”</p>
