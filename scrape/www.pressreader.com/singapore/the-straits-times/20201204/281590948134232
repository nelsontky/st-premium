    <p>Pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs) were not hit as hard as non-PMETs by the Covid-19 pan­demic, ac­cord­ing to an­nual ad­vance es­ti­mates for the res­i­dent labour force re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with PMETs, nonPMETs saw a steeper in­crease in un­em­ploy­ment rates and a greater re­duc­tion in work­ing hours.</p>
    <p>This is mainly be­cause in­dus­tries more se­verely im­pacted by Covid-19 have a higher con­cen­tra­tion of non-PMETs, and their jobs are less suit­able for re­mote work, the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) said in its re­port.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­dus­tries in­clude con­struc­tion, re­tail trade, and food and bev­er­age ser­vices.</p>
    <p>But the un­em­ploy­ment rate of 6.4 per cent for non-PMETs this year re­mained be­low past re­ces­sion­ary peaks. This was also the case for PMETs, whose un­em­ploy­ment rate was 3.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis, the job­less rates for non-PMETs peaked at 6.9 per cent in 2009, and 3.9 per cent for PMETs.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, MOM said the in­creases in over­all un­em­ploy­ment rates for both PMETs and nonPMETs were driven by short­ert­erm un­em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>The in­crease in long-term un­em­ploy­ment rates – cov­er­ing those out of work for more than 25 weeks – for both groups was smaller.</p>
    <p>PMETs in their 40s ex­pe­ri­enced a larger in­crease in the long-term un­em­ploy­ment rate than those in other age groups.</p>
    <p>Among non-PMETs, long-term un­em­ploy­ment rose for res­i­dents be­low 30 and in their 40s, but held steady for those aged 50 and older.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 also led to re­duced work­ing hours for more nonPMETs (14 per cent) than for PMETs (5.7 per cent).</p>
    <p>Sec­tors that saw the high­est pro­por­tion of work­ers hav­ing their work­ing hours re­duced in­cluded ac­com­mo­da­tion (25.8 per cent), food and bev­er­age ser­vices (21.1 per cent) and other com­mu­nity, so­cial and per­sonal ser­vices (15.1 per cent).</p>
    <p>Lower-wage work­ers also saw a steeper de­cline in monthly in­come at the 20th per­centile, from $2,457 in June last year to $2,340 in June this year.</p>
    <p>“This is quite con­sis­tent with the trend that you see in many other coun­tries, be­cause the na­ture of the work that was more im­pacted by Covid-19 did have a larger share of their work­force earn­ing less,” Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said dur­ing a visit to se­cu­rity agency Soverus yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>How­ever, when fac­tor­ing in gov­ern­ment as­sis­tance for low-wage work­ers, such as the Work­fare In­come Sup­ple­ment and Work­fare Spe­cial Pay­ment, the me­dian in­come for the 20th per­centile fell far less, to $2,449 in June this year.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said MOM will be work­ing with other agen­cies to en­sure that eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties will con­tinue to ex­pand to make jobs avail­able to job seek­ers. But th­ese jobs will likely re­quire dis­placed work­ers to pick up new skills, she added.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said MOM will con­tin­u­ously re­fine and en­hance ex­ist­ing schemes, such as the SGUnited trainee­ship pro­grammes and pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­grammes for mid-ca­reer in­di­vid­u­als, to help job seek­ers pick up the skills needed.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, Soverus tapped the Se­cu­rity Pro­duc­tiv­ity Ini­tia­tive to re­design and en­hance the j ob scope of its se­cu­rity of­fi­cers, in­clud­ing Mr Al­lan Chan, 57, a se­cu­rity su­per­vi­sor.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan, who su­per­vises two se­cu­rity of­fi­cers at a church in Paya Le­bar, un­der­went train­ing to pick up cus­tomer ser­vice skills last year.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said that MOM and its tri­par­tite part­ners are also study­ing how to in­crease wages of low­in­come work­ers, and the work­group will re­lease its rec­om­men­da­tions in the near fu­ture.</p>
