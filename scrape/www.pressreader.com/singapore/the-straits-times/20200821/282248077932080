    <p>ORLANDO (Florida) • The warn­ing signs were al­ready ev­i­dent i n Game 1. Had Kristaps Porzingis not been ejected with al­most two quar­ters to go – a soft call that was uni­ver­sally con­demned as “bo­gus” – when the Dal­las Mavericks were in the as­cen­dancy, the Los An­ge­les Clippers may well have lost the first game in this se­ries.</p>
    <p>This time, though, there was no ques­tion­able of­fi­ci­at­ing as the Lat­vian played the en­tire game and the Mavericks’ qual­ity shone as they stunned the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) con­tenders 127-114 to level their play-off se­ries at one apiece.</p>
    <p>Porzingis con­trib­uted 23 points and seven re­bounds and such was Dal­las’ dom­i­nance that their lead never once slipped, even though their best player Luka Don­cic sat out most of the fourth quar­ter at Dis­ney World.</p>
    <p>The reign­ing Rookie of the Year paced his team, who are in the post-sea­son for the first time since 2016, with 28 points, break­ing an­other record in the process.</p>
    <p>In Game 1, the All-Star guard recorded 42 points – the most scored by a player on his play-off de­but – and on Wed­nes­day, he passed league great Ka­reem Ab­dulJab­bar to be­come the first player in his­tory to score 70 points in his first two play-off games.</p>
    <p>Last year’s Fi­nals Most Valu­able Player Kawhi Leonard led all scor­ers with 35 points, but the Clippers strug­gled to deal with the Mavericks’ re­lent­less shoot­ing.</p>
    <p>Their other All-Star for­ward, Paul Ge­orge, could only add 14 points after run­ning into foul trou­ble and Clippers coach Doc Rivers ad­mit­ted he is wor­ried the matchup is turn­ing out to be a far more even con­test than ex­pected.</p>
    <p>He said: “They (Dal­las) were just look­ing us in the eye, tak­ing us off the drib­ble, play­ing bas­ket­ball. They played to­gether, moved the ball. I thought that stood out.</p>
    <p>“I think at half-time, we had seven as­sists. Our starters had two as­sists at half-time. I think we ended up with four as­sists from our starters.</p>
    <p>“That’s not how we’ve played all year. If we play like that, we can’t win.”</p>
    <p>“I j ust thought they were the more phys­i­cal team. They played harder. They at­tacked us. We didn’t re­spond well.”</p>
    <p>The Clippers’ pri­mary de­fen­sive as­set, Pa­trick Bev­er­ley, was lim­ited to just 20 min­utes in Game 1 and was ab­sent on Wed­nes­day due to a lin­ger­ing calf prob­lem that Rivers re­vealed could keep him out of Game 3 to­day.</p>
    <p>With the tena­cious guard miss­ing, the Mavericks were able to free up their shoot­ers eas­ily. Their bench also stepped up, outscor­ing the Clippers’ bench by 10.</p>
    <p>That strength in depth will be key to up­set­ting one of the favourites for the cham­pi­onship, ac­cord­ing to Don­cic.</p>
    <p>“We’ve just got three (wins) left,” the Slove­nian guard told ESPN. “We can fight with them. Any se­ries we go in, we’re go­ing to be­lieve we can win, for sure.</p>
    <p>“If you don’t be­lieve it, you’re not sup­posed to be here.</p>
    <p>“That’s great stats (over­tak­ing Ab­dul-Jab­bar), but we got a win. They (crit­ics) should be say­ing we got a chance in this first round. A lot of peo­ple counted us out. But I know they should be say­ing we got a chance.”</p>
    <p>Porzingis, also play­ing i n the play-offs for the first time, added: “We knew after the first game we were right there and we could com­pete with prob­a­bly one of the favourites to win it all.”</p>
    <p>We can fight with them. Any se­ries we go in, we’re go­ing to be­lieve we can win, for sure. If you don’t be­lieve it, you’re not sup­posed to be here. ’’ LUKA DON­CIC, Dal­las tal­is­man, on his team’s se­ries with the LA Clippers.</p>
