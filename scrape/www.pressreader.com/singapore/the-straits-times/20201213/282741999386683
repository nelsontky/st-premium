    <p>9.9, 10.10, 11.11 and 12.12. For those who have switched to on­line shop­ping in a big way, these num­bers have be­come part of their lingo.</p>
    <p>The same goes for a techno­phobe Gen­er­a­tion X-er like me, who is miss­ing the onio­ma­nia gene. But thanks to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, these four su­per shop­ping days on Asia’s e-Com­merce cal­en­dar are now part of my vo­cab­u­lary.</p>
    <p>Switch­ing to on­line shop­ping was a no brainer, es­pe­cially af­ter the lock­down made this in­evitable. My mi­crowave oven died dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, and I had no other way of get­ting a re­place­ment. I found my new oven and even got it de­liv­ered for free, thanks to on­line shop­ping guides like Drum It Loud, which did the leg­work by get­ting price com­par­isons on Shopee, Lazada, Ama­zon and Qoo10.</p>
    <p>Even af­ter Sin­ga­pore en­tered Phase 2, I felt no com­pelling need to visit phys­i­cal stores for house­hold es­sen­tials or even food; my shop­ping habits have gone dig­i­tal. These su­per shop­ping days only made it more at­trac­tive to bar­gain-hunt on­line.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther, Shopee, op­er­ated by home-grown In­ter­net gi­ant Sea, has clev­erly par­layed its Garena unit’s ex­per­tise in gam­ing to keep techno­phobes like me in their on­line store through “shop­per­tain­ment”.</p>
    <p>The trend orig­i­nated in China and draws on in-app en­ter­tain­ment fea­tures like games and live-stream­ing shows that al­low sell­ers and in­vited hosts to en­gage with users.</p>
    <p>Live-stream­ing repli­cates the phys­i­cal in-store ex­pe­ri­ence on­line – an el­e­ment that had been miss­ing up to now. This has found trac­tion among con­sumers in South-east Asia as they in­creas­ingly switch to on­line modes of en­ter­tain­ment in the wake of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>A re­cent re­port from data con­tent firm Black­box noted that sev­eral key re­gional e-com­merce play­ers seem to have strength­ened their po­si­tions dur­ing the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>It found that 71 per cent of nearly 4,800 con­sumers sur­veyed across Asean re­ported us­ing Shopee since the pan­demic started, with us­age the strong­est in Malaysia (83 per cent) and In­done­sia (76 per cent), but lower in Sin­ga­pore (52 per cent).</p>
    <p>The re­port also found that 63 per cent of Sin­ga­pore­ans are spend­ing more on­line with their to­tal out­lay up 31 per cent on av­er­age.</p>
    <p>Lazada is the re­gion’s sec­ond big­gest e-com­merce player at 48 per cent, with its high­est mar­ket share in Thai­land (62 per cent). This is fol­lowed by Grab, with a 42 per cent slice of the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>But while Shopee, Lazada and Grab have higher us­age rates, sat­is­fac­tion lev­els fell be­hind, par­tic­u­larly for Lazada, ac­cord­ing to the re­port.</p>
    <p>“Many of the is­sues re­lat­ing to Lazada/Redmart re­late to chal­lenges across the en­tire ful­fil­ment cy­cle: from users com­plain­ing of dif­fi­culty find­ing the right prod­uct or ser­vice, to un­re­li­able in­for­ma­tion and re­views, in ad­di­tion to a de­liv­ery ser­vice that lacks re­li­a­bil­ity,” the re­port said.</p>
    <p>“The stan­dards that ma­jor e-com­merce brands have achieved – for ex­am­ple, Ama­zon with its in­ven­tory, price, re­li­a­bil­ity and speed of ser­vice – will in­creas­ingly ap­ply to all oth­ers.</p>
    <p>“(Given) the stiff com­pe­ti­tion, it is en­tirely plau­si­ble that con­sumers will turn to a com­peti­tor brand should a sin­gle ex­pe­ri­ence turn them off for good.”</p>
    <p>That is a find­ing I can per­son­ally re­late to, given my re­cent dis­cov­ery that buy­ing a T-shirt on plat­forms like Shopee or Lazada re­quires a lot more leg­work than I thought, not just be­cause I had to trawl through the sheer vol­ume of sell­ers.</p>
    <p>The big­ger prob­lem is that there is no uni­for­mity in clothes size, so an XL-sized T-shirt from one main­land Chi­nese seller may not be of the same mea­sure­ments as an XL-sized one sold by an In­done­sian seller.</p>
    <p>Some ads carry size charts, but some don’t. You then have to try to con­tact the seller to get that in­for­ma­tion and hope he or she re­sponds. Small won­der that a num­ber of con­sumers com­plain in prod­uct rat­ings that what they saw in the ad dif­fered from what they ac­tu­ally got. Some­times, the ad­ver­tised price doesn’t even match the price at check­out.</p>
    <p>Be­ing able to read what other con­sumers say in prod­uct rat­ings about an item you are plan­ning to get from a par­tic­u­lar seller is gen­er­ally help­ful. But a draw­back is that those who ask for re­funds or do re­turns, don’t get to give rea­sons why they did so – this is feed­back I feel would help con­sumers and keep sell­ers ac­count­able.</p>
    <p>Shopee has a fea­ture called Shopee Guar­an­tee that with­holds pay­ment to sell­ers un­til buy­ers con­firm that they have re­ceived their or­ders in good con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>This is aimed at re­duc­ing fraud and trans­ac­tion risks.</p>
    <p>“E-com­merce is still a nascent in­dus­try in the re­gion. As a whole, e-com­merce play­ers must con­tinue to take steps to im­ple­ment stronger pro­cesses and in­no­va­tive fea­tures that can cul­ti­vate trust among users,” a Shopee spokesman said.</p>
    <p>With the in­creas­ing use of on­line chan­nels by con­sumers, on­line re­tail­ers need to work harder on im­prov­ing the con­sumer ex­pe­ri­ence in brows­ing, search, pur­chase and de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>“With 5G tech­nol­ogy on the verge of trans­form­ing plat­form ca­pa­bil­i­ties, cur­rent mar­ket lead­ers may wake to find them­selves no longer at the front of that queue if they don’t ad­dress con­cerns and work to de­liver a more fric­tion­less ex­pe­ri­ence,” said Black­box Re­search in­ter­na­tional com­mer­cial di­rec­tor Yashan Cama.</p>
    <p>While the over­whelm­ing ma­jor­ity of users of on­line ser­vices are com­fort­able with the shift to dig­i­tal, 15 per cent of re­spon­dents in the Black­box poll re­main un­com­fort­able. This trans­lates to mil­lions of peo­ple still not get­ting an ex­pe­ri­ence that works for them, the re­port found.</p>
    <p>The stakes are there­fore get­ting higher, es­pe­cially with the pos­si­bil­ity of more cross-plat­form merg­ers.</p>
    <p>Alibaba Group is re­port­edly in talks to in­vest US$3 bil­lion (S$4 bil­lion) in Grab Hold­ings, and pos­si­bly to in­te­grate Grab’s de­liv­ery net­work into Lazada, giv­ing the start-up ac­cess to a wider net­work of con­sumers.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Sea is set to see ac­cel­er­ated growth in dig­i­tal fi­nan­cial ser­vices across South-east Asia, thanks to its new dig­i­tal bank­ing li­cence.</p>
    <p>DBS Group Re­search noted last week that the ex­pected im­pact from the li­cence is “promis­ing”, as mil­len­ni­als who use Garena’s gam­ing plat­form “might find it com­fort­able” to also main­tain a bank ac­count with Sea. Tak­ing de­posits and serv­ing as a lender for its mer­chants on Shopee will also give Sea an edge over its e-wal­let com­peti­tors, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>But in the race for mar­ket share, they should de­vote more re­sources to rais­ing seller ser­vice and prod­uct stan­dards, and im­prov­ing con­sumer pro­tec­tions es­pe­cially as they ac­cel­er­ate their ex­pan­sion into dig­i­tal fi­nan­cial ser­vices.</p>
