    <p>Amid a drive for dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion that is al­ready chang­ing economies, Sin­ga­pore ini­ti­ated dis­cus­sions with like-minded trade part­ners to de­velop ba­sic rules for dig­i­tal trade and a frame­work for col­lab­o­ra­tion. Th­ese pave the way for growth and hir­ing amid chal­leng­ing global con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Amid a drive for dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion that is al­ready chang­ing cities and economies, Sin­ga­pore ini­ti­ated dis­cus­sions with like-minded trade part­ners to de­velop ba­sic rules for dig­i­tal trade and a frame­work for col­lab­o­ra­tion in the dig­i­tal era.</p>
    <p>For­mal ne­go­ti­a­tions cul­mi­nated this year in two pacts – the Dig­i­tal Econ­omy Part­ner­ship Agree­ment (Depa) with New Zealand and Chile, and the Sin­ga­pore-Aus­tralia Dig­i­tal Econ­omy Agree­ment (Sadea).</p>
    <p>A Dig­i­tal Econ­omy Agree­ment (DEA) with South Korea is cur­rently in the works.</p>
    <p>Mr Aaron Maniam, deputy sec­re­tary of in­dus­try and in­for­ma­tion at the Min­istry of Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion, said the agree­ments lay down ba­sic rules on or­gan­is­ing the in­no­va­tion process in value chains across bor­ders, while lever­ag­ing tech­nol­ogy to boost the trade of tra­di­tional goods and ser­vices.</p>
    <p>“The fact is that the dig­i­tal econ­omy is now more in­ter­twined with so many as­pects of the con­ven­tional econ­omy. And it is the in­ter­twin­ing that we are try­ing to re­spond to,” he said in an in­ter­view with The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>An­other ben­e­fit comes in the form of hir­ing more peo­ple to sup­port ex­pan­sion as more Sin­ga­pore com­pa­nies tap busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties made pos­si­ble by DEAs, he said.</p>
    <p>“The more there is de­mand for what com­pa­nies do and the eas­ier it</p>
    <p>ADAPT­ING TO NEW RE­AL­ITY</p>
    <p>is to do busi­ness, the more jobs will ac­tu­ally be cre­ated.”</p>
    <p>Such agree­ments are all the more cru­cial given that the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and geopo­lit­i­cal ten­sions may have made growth in cross-bor­der trade more chal­leng­ing for now.</p>
    <p>How­ever, amid in­creas­ing global po­lar­i­sa­tion, set­ting ba­sic rules and stan­dards for fa­cil­i­tat­ing the use and avoid­ing abuse of tech­nol­ogy in trade has made lit­tle progress at global trade fo­rums.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the trans­for­ma­tion brought about by tech­nol­ogy, in both the so­cial and busi­ness spheres, seems ir­re­versible.</p>
    <p>While ex­ist­ing free trade agree­ments (FTAs) also take dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy into ac­count, most of them have been de­signed for tra­di­tional trade in goods and ser­vices, said Mr Maniam.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, the DEA with Aus­tralia, for ex­am­ple, cov­ers is­sues such as pa­per­less trad­ing, e-in­voic­ing, e-pay­ments, fin­tech, per­sonal in­for­ma­tion pro­tec­tion, ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, dig­i­tal ID, data in­no­va­tion, small and medium-sized en­ter­prise (SME) co­op­er­a­tion, on­line con­sumer pro­tec­tion, cross-bor­der data flows, data lo­cal­i­sa­tion, source code, sub­ma­rine ca­bles and stan­dards for dig­i­tal trade.</p>
    <p>“What we’re see­ing today is a need to re­spond to trends that are in­ten­si­fy­ing and ac­cel­er­at­ing,” said Mr Maniam.</p>
    <p>There is a need for rules and poli­cies to keep pace with the speed of dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion, he added.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a study by the Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and Devel­op­ment (OECD), a 10 per cent in­crease in dig­i­tal con­nec­tiv­ity be­tween two coun­tries raises goods trade by nearly 2 per cent and trade in ser­vices by over 3 per cent.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion also in­creases the ben­e­fits that can be drawn from re­gional trade agree­ments.</p>
    <p>When com­bined with a trade pact, a 10 per cent in­crease in dig­i­tal con­nec­tiv­ity in­creases ex­ports by an ad­di­tional 2.3 per cent, the OECD study shows.</p>
    <p>Ms Ng Bee Kim, direc­tor-gen­eral of trade at the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try, said it is im­per­a­tive for com­pa­nies in Sin­ga­pore to seize the chance of­fered by dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion and take ad­van­tage of both do­mes­tic and in­ter­na­tional op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>“DEAs help com­pa­nies here get plugged into global sup­ply chains, as well as fa­cil­i­tate dig­i­tal and data con­nec­tiv­ity across bor­ders. Th­ese are the ar­eas of col­lab­o­ra­tion across tech­no­log­i­cal and dig­i­tal ar­eas that we hope to achieve with our trade part­ners,” she said.</p>
    <p>Be­sides driv­ing strong de­mand for dig­i­tal so­lu­tions in the in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy sec­tor, the pan­demic has also ac­cel­er­ated tech­nol­ogy adop­tion across in­dus­tries and catal­ysed trans­for­ma­tion of their busi­ness mod­els – es­pe­cially for in­dus­tries that tra­di­tion­ally rely on phys­i­cal in­ter­ac­tions, such as retail, food ser­vices, health­care, man­u­fac­tur­ing and lo­gis­tics.</p>
    <p>This ac­cel­er­a­tion of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion has en­abled busi­nesses in th­ese sec­tors to ac­cess broader mar­kets and con­sumer seg­ments than be­fore, in or­der to thrive even amid the on­go­ing pub­lic health cri­sis.</p>
    <p>SMEs, in par­tic­u­lar, can now en­ter mar­kets more eas­ily and com­pete more ef­fi­ciently.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, pay­ment pro­cesses con­tinue to re­quire en­ter­prises to labour against mil­lions of pa­per in­voices or PDF at­tach­ments, all of which must be man­aged by hand. But last year, Sin­ga­pore took a leap to­wards help­ing com­pa­nies break through this pa­per jam by an­nounc­ing that gov­ern­ment agen­cies can now ac­cept e-in­voices within the coun­try or across bor­ders via a na­tion­wide e-in­voic­ing network. The network lever­ages the Pan-Euro­pean Pub­lic Pro­cure­ment On-Line frame­work.</p>
    <p>Cou­pled with DEAs that pro­mote in­ter­op­er­a­ble e-in­voic­ing net­works, SMEs can now save time and money through dig­i­tal­is­ing their in­voic­ing sys­tems, and when trans­act­ing in­ter­na­tion­ally.</p>
    <p>Mr Maniam said elec­tronic in­voic­ing and elec­tronic trade doc­u­men­ta­tion have in­creased, re­flect­ing the im­pact of Depa and Sadea.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, New Zealand and Sin­ga­pore’s Cus­toms au­thor­i­ties have be­gun work un­der the DEA on a sys­tem that will fa­cil­i­tate the ex­change of e-cer­tifi­cates for an­i­mal prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Rules and stan­dards set in the DEAs will make busi­ness out­comes more pre­dictable, Mr Maniam said.</p>
    <p>“Rules are com­mon knowl­edge. And com­mon knowl­edge is what ac­tu­ally causes en­able­ment and fa­cil­i­ta­tion. Estab­lish­ing mu­tual trust with our trad­ing part­ners on how to col­lab­o­rate on deal­ing with the dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion is what DEAs are about.”</p>
    <p>The fact is that the dig­i­tal econ­omy is now more in­ter­twined with so many as­pects of the con­ven­tional econ­omy. And it is the in­ter­twin­ing that we are try­ing to re­spond to... The more there is de­mand for what com­pa­nies do and the eas­ier it is to do busi­ness, the more jobs will ac­tu­ally be cre­ated.</p>
    <p>MR AARON MANIAM, deputy sec­re­tary of in­dus­try and in­for­ma­tion at the Min­istry of Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion.</p>
