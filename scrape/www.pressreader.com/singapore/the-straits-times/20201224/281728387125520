    <p>Ev­ery Christ­mas, Mr Euphraim Yu­varaj trav­els to visit his grand­mother and other rel­a­tives in Taip­ing, Perak, some 250km north of Malaysia’s cap­i­tal Kuala Lumpur.</p>
    <p>He will not be mak­ing the three­hour jour­ney this year, even though travel curbs across most of Penin­su­lar Malaysia were lifted in time for Christ­mas cel­e­bra­tions.</p>
    <p>In­ter­state and in­ter-dis­trict travel has been al­lowed in much of the coun­try since Dec 7, but Mr Euphraim, 33, re­mains very con­cerned over the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has shown no signs of abat­ing in Malaysia de­spite the par­tial lock­down im­posed on much of Klang Val­ley – the coun­try’s big­gest ur­ban re­gion which in­cludes Kuala Lumpur – from midOc­to­ber till early this month.</p>
    <p>Christ­mas will be the first ma­jor re­li­gious fes­ti­val not to be sub­jected to travel curbs since the gov­ern­ment im­posed the move­ment con­trol or­der in re­sponse to the pan­demic in mid-March.</p>
    <p>The coun­try, where Mus­lims form the ma­jor­ity of the pop­u­la­tion, was still in the grip of a rel­a­tively strict lock­down dur­ing Hari Raya Aidil­fitri in May. Much of Klang Val­ley was also un­der par­tial lock­down dur­ing Deep­avali last month.</p>
    <p>Mr Euphraim lives in Pu­chong, a large sub­urb in the state of Se­lan­gor. He usu­ally trav­els with his fam­ily – which now in­cludes an in­fant daugh­ter – to Taip­ing to cel­e­brate both Deep­avali and Christ­mas, but has opted not to do so this year due to the high num­ber of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>He said: “We see cases are breach­ing 2,000 ev­ery day, and I do not want to risk it, hav­ing a young daugh­ter. We are stay­ing back here and cel­e­brat­ing with just the im­me­di­ate fam­ily.”</p>
    <p>Mr Euphraim added that he would also not be hav­ing vis­i­tors in his house.</p>
    <p>Malaysia is in the midst of a third wave of in­fec­tion which be­gan in late Septem­ber, sparked by the Sabah state leg­isla­tive elec­tions.</p>
    <p>Many who trav­elled to the east Malaysian state to cam­paign or vote re­turned to the penin­sula and spread the virus.</p>
    <p>Since then, the coun­try has con­sis­tently recorded daily cases in the thou­sands and the num­bers have shown no signs of abat­ing.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar con­cerns have also dis­cour­aged Ms Eve­lyn Baskaradas, an IT pro­fes­sional, from trav­el­ling any­where to cel­e­brate Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>She said she has trav­elled in­ter­state fre­quently in the past dur­ing the Christ­mas hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>“We will have a lim­ited and in­for­mal fam­ily group this year as ev­ery­one is sim­i­larly cau­tious. We won’t be hav­ing any­one over.”</p>
    <p>In the two weeks since the travel curbs were lifted, Malaysia has recorded a daily tally of over 2,000 cases three times, in­clud­ing on Mon­day and Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has reg­is­tered a thou­sand cases for all but one day since Dec 7.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, 1,348 new cases were reg­is­tered, bring­ing the num­ber of ac­tive cases to 18,279 – an all-time high.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin an­nounced that the gov­ern­ment was well on the way to ac­quir­ing vac­cines for at least 83 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The first batch is ex­pected to ar­rive in Fe­bru­ary and Tan Sri Muhyid­din has said he will be among the first to be vac­ci­nated to con­vince the peo­ple that the vac­cine ob­tained is safe and ef­fec­tive.</p>
