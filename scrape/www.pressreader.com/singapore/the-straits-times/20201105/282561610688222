    <p>PARIS • Ste­fanos Tsit­si­pas says he is un­sure how his ATP Fi­nals ti­tle de­fence will go later this month, after the Greek suf­fered a re­cur­rence of a leg in­jury dur­ing his sec­ond-round de­feat at the Paris Mas­ters on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Seeded sec­ond at the last ATP Mas­ters event of the year, the world No. 6 bowed out after los­ing to French­man Ugo Hum­bert 7-6 (7-4), 6-7 (6-8), 7-6 (7-3) at an empty Bercy arena.</p>
    <p>“Right now, I don’t know. I re­ally don’t know,” Tsit­si­pas told re­porters when asked about his chances at The O2 in Lon­don, where the sea­son-end­ing ATP Fi­nals will be held with­out spec­ta­tors from Nov 15 to 22.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing the sec­ond set my Roland Gar­ros in­jury came back, and it wasn’t as bad as at the French Open, but it kind of had me on the edge of things, and I wasn’t sure if that’s good for me to be out there.</p>
    <p>“But that’s not an ex­cuse, for sure. I still fought and gave my best out there, de­spite this thing that I had on court. I’m sad, for sure.”</p>
    <p>It was a sec­ond straight nar­row de­feat for Tsit­si­pas after his loss to Bul­gar­ian Grigor Dim­itrov in Vi­enna last week. The Greek said he had in­jured his l eg dur­ing his French Open semi-fi­nal against world No. 1 No­vak Djokovic last month, which ham­pered him in the fifth set of his loss.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier on Tues­day, Bel­gian eighth seed David Gof­fin fell at his first hur­dle, los­ing 6-4, 7-6 (8-6) to Slo­vakian world No. 105 Nor­bert Gom­bos.</p>
    <p>Mat­teo Ber­ret­tini was another high seed to bow out in his open­ing match, the sev­enth-seeded Ital­ian los­ing 7-6 (7-3), 6-7 (0-7), 7-5 to Amer­i­can Mar­cos Giron in a match which fin­ished at al­most 1am lo­cal time.</p>
    <p>In yes­ter­day’s ac­tion, South Africa’s Kevin An­der­son re­tired in­jured dur­ing the first set of the round-of-32 clash against third seed Daniil Medvedev of Rus­sia with the score level at 6-6.</p>
    <p>Ar­gentina’s Diego Schwartz­man, the French Open semi-fi­nal­ist, de­feated French­man Richard Gas­quet 7-5, 6-3.</p>
    <p>He next faces Span­ish qual­i­fier Ale­jan­dro Davi­dovich Fok­ina and will se­cure the last spot in Lon­don by reach­ing the semi-fi­nals. But he would qual­ify even if he fails to do so, as long as nei­ther Pablo Car­reno Busta, Mi­los Raonic or Stan Wawrinka wins the ti­tle.</p>
    <p>Cana­dian Raonic beat French­man Pierre-Hugues Her­bert 6-4, 6-4, while Ger­man Alexan­der Zverev cruised past Serb Miomir Kec­manovic 6-2, 6-2.</p>
