    <p>A man be­friended a 13-year-old boy who had dis­ci­plinary is­sues and promised the lat­ter’s fa­ther that he would “guide and ad­vise” the teenager.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the 25-year-old man mo­lested the boy on two oc­ca­sions in March.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean of­fender was yes­ter­day sen­tenced to two years’ jail with five strokes of the cane and a fine of $2,500. He pleaded guilty to one count of mo­lesta­tion and an un­re­lated charge of crim­i­nal breach of trust.</p>
    <p>He is not named ow­ing to a gag order to pro­tect the vic­tim’s iden­tity.</p>
    <p>The man got to know the vic­tim in early March through a mu­tual friend. He later asked the boy to join him on an overnight fish­ing trip.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Ken­neth Kee said: “The vic­tim was not or­di­nar­ily al­lowed by his par­ents to stay out overnight, so the ac­cused spoke to the vic­tim’s fa­ther.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing this con­ver­sa­tion, the vic­tim’s fa­ther in­formed the ac­cused about his con­cern that the vic­tim had been hav­ing dis­ci­plinary is­sues.”</p>
    <p>The man then as­sured the fa­ther that he could “guide and ad­vise” the teenager “ap­pro­pri­ately”.</p>
    <p>The two went on a fish­ing trip on March 16 and con­tin­ued to spend time to­gether there­after.</p>
    <p>On March 19, the man in­vited the boy to stay overnight at his Choa Chu Kang flat and they shared a bed.</p>
    <p>DPP Kee said that the man mo­lested the boy in the wee hours of March 20. “The vic­tim, who did not con­sent to the act, was shocked, scared and un­cer­tain as to how he should have re­acted at the time. None­the­less, the vic­tim kept si­lent and pre­tended to stay asleep on the bed,” he added.</p>
    <p>Af­ter they got up, the boy joined the man in set­ting up some dec­o­ra­tions for a wed­ding.</p>
    <p>Later that day, the man sent the boy’s mother a text mes­sage, ask­ing if she would al­low her son to stay over for one more night. The woman agreed as she thought he was a good role model for her son.</p>
    <p>The boy agreed to re­turn to the man’s flat as he had left his be­long­ings there. They were rest­ing in bed in the wee hours of March 21, when the man mo­lested him again.</p>
    <p>The boy later told his par­ents about his or­deal. He lodged a po­lice re­port on March 22, the court heard.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, the man was work­ing as a de­liv­ery­man from Feb 24 to March 6 when he was tasked to de­liver some items to a ware­house. But he made off with items in­clud­ing four pairs of shoes and three jack­ets worth $1,360 in all.</p>
    <p>He was caught and has since made full resti­tu­tion.</p>
