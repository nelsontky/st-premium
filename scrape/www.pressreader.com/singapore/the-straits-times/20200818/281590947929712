    <p>Hong Kong ac­tress Car­man Lee, who is known for star­ring in the 1995 TV adap­ta­tion of The Re­turn Of The Con­dor Heroes, has long kept her age a se­cret. But on her birth­day on Sun­day, the ac­tress fi­nally revealed her age. She dis­closed on Weibo that she is 54.</p>
    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong ac­tress Car­man Lee, known for play­ing Xiao Long Nu (Little Dragon Maiden) in the 1995 tele­vi­sion adap­ta­tion of Louis Cha’s The Re­turn Of The Con­dor Heroes, has fi­nally revealed her ac­tual age.</p>
    <p>Of­ten re­garded to be the most beau­ti­ful Xiao Long Nu, Lee has kept her age a mys­tery for a long time and was thought to be as young as 47 or at most 53.</p>
    <p>How­ever, on her birth­day on Sun­day, the svelte Lee, who has been praised for her youth­ful looks, dis­closed on Weibo that she is ac­tu­ally 54.</p>
    <p>“The me of to­day, who turns 54, has walked through much of life. In the eyes of some peo­ple, I might no longer be a woman, much less a fe­male ac­tress in her prime,” she wrote.</p>
    <p>But she main­tained that what is most im­por­tant is to stay healthy.</p>
    <p>“There might be some that feel that when a woman is young, she should be skinny. And when she ages, she should have more meat. How­ever, ev­ery­one’s per­cep­tion of beauty is dif­fer­ent. Fat or thin, it is best to be healthy.”</p>
    <p>Chi­nese me­dia re­ports com­mented that Lee, who acted op­po­site Louis Koo, 49, in Con­dor Heroes, has turned out to be older than Koo in real life as in the show.</p>
    <p>In ear­lier in­ter­views, Lee dis­closed that she had slipped into de­pres­sion about a decade ago af­ter break­ing up with her boyfriend of 10 years in 2008 and her father’s death from ill­ness in 2009.</p>
    <p>She cred­its her fam­ily and friends for help­ing her to re­cover.</p>
    <p>In re­cent years, she has ap­peared in Chi­nese pro­duc­tions, in­clud­ing pop­u­lar fan­tasy se­ries The Untamed, and is known for her healthy life­style and toned fig­ure.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, she also took some ques­tions from ne­ti­zens, in­clud­ing why she has not got­ten mar­ried.</p>
    <p>She wrote: “I have al­ways felt that an ideal mar­riage is to sim­ply meet the right per­son at the right time – and not to get mar­ried in it­self.”</p>
