    <p>Filipino ac­tress Crisel Con­sunji was thrilled to be named Best New Per­former at last year’s Hong Kong Film Awards for her de­but role in Still Hu­man (2018), where she played a do­mes­tic helper op­po­site vet­eran ac­tor An­thony Wong.</p>
    <p>But the 36-year-old Hong Kong­based ac­tress is not jump­ing at the chance to play an­other sim­i­lar role. She is glad to be able to break away from the stereo­type as­so­ci­ated with her na­tion­al­ity in the Hong Kong film in­dus­try and play a teacher in the drama se­ries Sin­gle Papa.</p>
    <p>The show – about a man rais­ing his young son alone after his wife’s death – is led by Hong Kong ac­tors Ron­ald Cheng and Mag­gie Che­ung Ho-yee. It is avail­able on Viu.</p>
    <p>Con­sunji speaks to The Straits Times over e-mail about her new project.</p>
    <p>What at­tracted you to the script and the role?</p>
    <p>First, there’s the em­pha­sis on the role of the fam­ily in so­ci­ety and how we must give time and ef­fort to nur­ture chil­dren in this spe­cial unit.</p>
    <p>I also ap­pre­ci­ate how the show val­ues men­tal health and sees the strug­gles of every char­ac­ter.</p>
    <p>Lastly, from a per­sonal an­gle, I ap­pre­ci­ate how the pro­duc­ers and di­rec­tors de­cided to break the stereo­type as­so­ci­ated with my na­tion­al­ity.</p>
    <p>I think be­ing a Filip­ina in Hong Kong, there are still many pock­ets in so­ci­ety who can­not imag­ine me in roles other than the com­mon stereo­type.</p>
    <p>And while I truly ap­pre­ci­ate the</p>
    <p>women work­ing in do­mes­tic ser­vices, I can­not keep play­ing the same char­ac­ter sim­ply be­cause some peo­ple can­not en­vi­sion me in a dif­fer­ent mould.</p>
    <p>What was it like work­ing with Ron­ald Cheng and Mag­gie Che­ung?</p>
    <p>They are such warm and sup­port­ive peo­ple. I was of­ten em­bar­rassed to be slow­ing down the shoot­ing process when I fum­bled with my Can­tonese lines, but they were al­ways so en­cour­ag­ing.</p>
    <p>They are gen­uinely warm peo­ple who con­nect with ev­ery­one on set.</p>
    <p>Do you feel any pres­sure to live up to the high ex­pec­ta­tions peo­ple may have of you as an ac­tress after your award-win­ning per­for­mance in Still Hu­man?</p>
    <p>I have to ad­mit the t hought crossed my mind. How­ever, the prag­ma­tist in me told me to drop my ego and treat all these as learn­ing ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>I’m new in this field and have much to learn.</p>
    <p>You have also been an ed­u­ca­tor in Hong Kong (Con­sunji co­founded the learn­ing cen­tre Baumhaus for chil­dren in Hong Kong in 2015). What were some chal­lenges you faced?</p>
    <p>When I was get­ting es­tab­lished in ed­u­ca­tion about 10 years ago, I ex­pe­ri­enced dis­crim­i­na­tion be­cause of the per­cep­tion that Filipino teach­ers could not be up to par with West­ern­ers.</p>
    <p>I had peo­ple tell me that par­ents would pre­fer to have their chil­dren taught by “na­tive English teach­ers”. The field has since evolved, thank­fully.</p>
    <p>In the field of act­ing, how­ever, I am sur­prised at how stereo­types seem to pre­vail. I still have peo­ple gen­uinely sur­prised that I speak good English or that I won’t jump at the op­por­tu­nity of por­tray­ing a do­mes­tic worker again.</p>
    <p>I don’t think this is re­flec­tive of the whole in­dus­try, but I’ve had my fair share of ex­pe­ri­ences that make me cringe.</p>
    <p>You trained with Reper­tory Philip­pines in Manila as a pro­fes­sional stage ac­tress and singer as a child and later moved to Hong Kong at age 23 to be a vo­cal­ist in Hong Kong Dis­ney­land pro­duc­tions. Yet you made your de­but as a tele­vi­sion and film ac­tress only three years ago. Why so late?</p>
    <p>I was not plan­ning on pur­su­ing a tele­vi­sion and film ca­reer.</p>
    <p>I grew up as a pro­fes­sional stage per­former, but was raised by my par­ents to be prag­matic – to re­mem­ber that even if I had tal­ent, there is also an el­e­ment of luck.</p>
    <p>So I pur­sued my mas­ter’s de­grees in po­lit­i­cal sci­ence and ed­u­ca­tion be­cause I felt I could make an im­pact with my tal­ent with­out nec­es­sar­ily try­ing to “make it”.</p>
    <p>The rea­son I did Still Hu­man was be­cause I be­lieved in its mes­sage and the op­por­tu­nity to rep­re­sent voices of women on the mar­gins. I did not ex­pect the project to grow as big as it did.</p>
    <p>I see TV and film as a creative chal­lenge and a plat­form to pro­mote so­cial good.</p>
