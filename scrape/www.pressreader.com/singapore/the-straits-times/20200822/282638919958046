    <p>• Em­ploy­ees at day­time tele­vi­sion talk show, The Ellen De­Generes Show (2003 to present), wi l l be re­ceiv­ing in­creased ben­e­fits as the show con­tin­ues to grap­ple with al­le­ga­tions of work­place tox­i­c­ity.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to en­ter­tain­ment news out­let Va­ri­ety, re­cently added ben­e­fits for staff in­clude birth­days off and five paid days off to use at their dis­cre­tion as well as paid time for fam­ily mat­ters and med­i­cal ap­point­ments.</p>
    <p>The news was de­liv­ered ear­lier this week by se­nior Ellen pro­duc­ers Mary Con­nelly and Andy Lass­ner, at a vir­tual town hall.</p>
    <p>The meet­ing also saw a teary De</p>
    <p>Generes apol­o­gise to em­ploy­ees for on-set tox­i­c­ity that oc­curred “on her watch”.</p>
    <p>Last month, Buz­zfeed News pub­lished an ex­plo­sive re­port, ex­pos­ing the re­al­i­ties of work­ing on set at the pop­u­lar talk show.</p>
    <p>For­mer and cur­rent em­ploy­ees re­counted in­ci­dents of sex­ual mis­con­duct and racial prej­u­dice, among other in­stances of in­tim­i­da­tion and bul­ly­ing.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing an in­ter­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion by Warner Bros Tele­vi­sion, which pro­duces the talk show, three of the show’s top pro­duc­ers – Ed Glavin, Kevin Le­man and Jonathan Nor­man – were fired.</p>
    <p>All three have been lev­elled with al­le­ga­tions of sex­ual mis­con­duct. Glavin has not pub­licly ad­dressed the claims, while Le­man and Nor­man have de­nied the ac­cu­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, De­Generes, 62, has apol­o­gised to em­ploy­ees mul­ti­ple times.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic opin­ion has been split. At the start of this month, a #Re­placeEllen hash­tag went vi­ral on Twit­ter. There were ru­mours that English co­me­dian-ac­tor James Cor­den was in talks to re­place De­Generes.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she has had sup­port­ers in­clud­ing her wife, ac­tress Por­tia de Rossi, singer Katy Perry as well as ac­tor and co­me­dian Kevin Hart.</p>
