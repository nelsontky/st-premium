    <p>The perkier re­tail sec­tor sug­gests rents could bot­tom out by the end of this year or early next year, Knight Frank noted in a re­port yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It said over­all re­tail rents are ex­pected to fall by 10 per cent to 15 per cent for the whole of this year due to the re­ces­sion and safe dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions, although de­clines in sub­ur­ban ar­eas will likely be just 7.5 per cent or less.</p>
    <p>“As phys­i­cal re­tail stores re­sumed op­er­a­tions, shop­per traf­fic also re­turned to a greater ex­tent in the sub­ur­ban malls com­pared to the cen­trally lo­cated ones that are more re­liant on the tourist dol­lar,” noted Knight Frank an­a­lysts.</p>
    <p>The ren­tal gap between sub­ur­ban malls and those in the Or­chard area will likely con­tinue to nar­row, they added, given much-re­duced tourist ar­rivals.</p>
    <p>Sub­ur­ban re­tail rents are ex­pected to re­cover sooner be­cause they are sup­ported by do­mes­tic con­sumers.</p>
    <p>Prime re­tail rents is­land­wide de­creased 10.3 per cent year on year in the third quar­ter to an av­er­age of $27.40 per sq ft (psf) per month.</p>
    <p>This drop was largely led by the 11 per cent fall in gross rents for prime re­tail spa­ces in the Or­chard Road shop­ping belt as stores con­tin­ued to strug­gle with the ab­sence of in­ter­na­tional tourists, Knight Frank noted.</p>
    <p>Prime space refers to units of between 350 sq ft and 1,500 sq ft with the best frontage, con­nec­tiv­ity, foot­fall and ac­ces­si­bil­ity in a mall.</p>
    <p>They are typ­i­cally on the ground or base­ment level, linked to an MRT sta­tion or bus in­ter­change.</p>
    <p>Gross rents of prime space in the Ma­rina Cen­tre, City Hall and Bugis re­gion tum­bled by 13.5 per cent year on year to $25.40 psf a month on av­er­age for the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>The city fringe posted an 8.6 per cent de­cline from a year ear­lier to $23.40 psf a month.</p>
    <p>Sub­ur­ban ar­eas, where rents started to sta­bilise in the three months to Sept 30, propped up the re­tail mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“As more em­ploy­ees work from home, the malls lo­cated within res­i­den­tial pop­u­la­tion cen­tres were vis­ited by many for daily ne­ces­si­ties and house­hold sun­dries,” the an­a­lysts wrote.</p>
    <p>The sub­ur­ban re­gion recorded the small­est drop in gross prime re­tail rents dur­ing the quar­ter, slip­ping 6.9 per cent on the year to av­er­age $26.60 psf per month.</p>
    <p>While tra­di­tional re­tail­ers such as Top­shop at VivoCity and Robin­sons at Jem closed in the third quar­ter, there were also new­com­ers such as 100-year-old Hong Kong bak­ery Hang He­ung, which opened its first Sin­ga­pore out­let at Ion Or­chard, Knight Frank noted.</p>
    <p>Other notable open­ings in­cluded store ex­pan­sions like Foot Locker at Or­chard Gate­way @ Emer­ald and De­cathlon at The Cen­tre­point.</p>
    <p>Au­gust re­tail sales – ex­clud­ing mo­tor ve­hi­cles – fell 8.4 per cent year on year, ac­cord­ing to fig­ures re­leased by the Depart­ment of Sta­tis­tics last week.</p>
    <p>To­tal re­tail sales were higher by 1.4 per cent in Au­gust on a sea­son­ally ad­justed month-on-month ba­sis. Ex­clud­ing mo­tor ve­hi­cles, they edged up 0.1 per cent on the month.</p>
