    <p>Covid-19 has put ad­di­tional stress on Sin­ga­pore­ans’ fi­nan­cial well-be­ing, ac­cord­ing to the lat­est sur­vey by OCBC Bank. About one-third of re­spon­dents faced dif­fi­cul­ties pay­ing off their hous­ing loans, with 9 per cent stat­ing that they may need to sell or down­grade.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has put ad­di­tional stress on Sin­ga­pore­ans’ fi­nan­cial well­be­ing, ac­cord­ing to the lat­est sur­vey by OCBC Bank.</p>
    <p>Al­though most Sin­ga­pore­ans are good at the “ba­sics”, par­tic­u­larly saving their money, many are now strug­gling to keep up with hous­ing loan pay­ments and main­tain­ing their usual lev­els of pas­sive in­come.</p>
    <p>The OCBC Fi­nan­cial Well­ness In­dex, which was first pub­lished last year, fell from 63 to 61 this year, re­flect­ing the global eco­nomic down­turn caused by the pan­demic, the bank said.</p>
    <p>For its sur­vey, OCBC polled 2,000 work­ing adults in Sin­ga­pore be­tween the ages of 21 and 65. Par­tic­i­pants were as­sessed on 10 pil­lars of fi­nan­cial well­ness, de­fined by the bank’s wealth man­age­ment ex­perts.</p>
    <p>About one-third (31 per cent) of re­spon­dents faced dif­fi­cul­ties pay­ing off their hous­ing loans, with 9 per cent stat­ing that they may need to sell or down­grade. The poor per­for­mance of stocks and div­i­dends also re­sulted in a loss in pas­sive in­come for most re­spon­dents.</p>
    <p>Out of three age groups, mil­len­ni­als – those aged 21 to 39 – seemed the most wor­ried about their fi­nances, with 49 per cent of those sur­veyed pre­oc­cu­pied with fi­nan­cial mat­ters, com­pared with 37 per cent of Gen­er­a­tion X and 26 per cent of baby boomers.</p>
    <p>At the same time, a sig­nif­i­cant pro­por­tion (48 per cent) of them spent to a large ex­tent “to keep up with their peers”.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with older gen­er­a­tions, mil­len­ni­als started in­vest­ing ear­lier, as they wanted to grow their wealth quickly. But they were also less in­clined to seek pro­fes­sional ad­vice when mak­ing in­vest­ment de­ci­sions, with only 26 per cent stat­ing they would do so, de­spite nearly half of them (42 per cent) ad­mit­ting they did not know the best way to grow their money.</p>
    <p>When asked how mil­len­ni­als, es­pe­cially younger ones, can start plan­ning prop­erly for re­tire­ment, the ad­vice from Ms Tan Siew Lee, OCBC’s head of wealth man­age­ment, was “to start small”.</p>
    <p>She said: “Your run­way is very long. Start with a reg­u­lar sav­ings plan, and get an ap­pro­pri­ate in­sur­ance pol­icy. You can ben­e­fit from the power of com­pound­ing.”</p>
    <p>The sur­vey also il­lu­mi­nated the dif­fer­ences in fi­nan­cial goals and at­ti­tudes be­tween men and women.</p>
    <p>When queried, more than onethird of women (38 per cent) felt that in­vest­ing was akin to gam­bling. But those who do in­vest af­ter re­search­ing and seek­ing ad­vice from qual­i­fied fi­nan­cial rep­re­sen­ta­tives of­ten out­per­form the men, with 68 per cent meet­ing or ex­ceed­ing their in­vest­ment target, com­pared with 59 per cent for the men.</p>
    <p>Ms Ni­cole Foo, vice-pres­i­dent of mar­ket re­search and group cus­tomer ex­pe­ri­ence at OCBC, ex­pressed her be­lief that this find­ing showed “women lack con­fi­dence, not com­pe­tence”.</p>
    <p>She said: “When we put women and men side by side, with the same vari­ables, women can ac­tu­ally do bet­ter in terms of their in­vest­ment per­for­mance.”</p>
    <p>In gen­eral, the sur­vey found that 78 per cent of Sin­ga­pore­ans un­der­es­ti­mate the amount re­quired for re­tire­ment by more than a third. And 75 per cent of them are not on track with their re­tire­ment plan­ning either.</p>
    <p>None­the­less, Ms Koh Ching Ching, head of group brand and com­mu­ni­ca­tions at OCBC, pointed out: “In the face of the pan­demic, Sin­ga­pore­ans are be­ing pru­dent and saving reg­u­larly, while also putting aside ad­e­quate emer­gency funds.”</p>
    <p>She added: “If these habits stick and lessons are learnt from the cri­sis, we ex­pect to see a rise in the in­dex next year – per­haps even sur­pass­ing 2019’s re­sult.”</p>
    <p>BEN­E­FIT FROM POWER OF COM­POUND­ING</p>
    <p>Your run­way is very long. Start with a reg­u­lar sav­ings plan, and get an ap­pro­pri­ate in­sur­ance pol­icy. You can ben­e­fit from the power of com­pound­ing.</p>
