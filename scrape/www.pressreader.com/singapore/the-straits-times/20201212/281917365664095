    <p>WASH­ING­TON The newly dis­closed fed­eral tax in­ves­ti­ga­tion into his son will test United States Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s stated com­mit­ment to in­de­pen­dent law en­force­ment, while leav­ing him in a no-win sit­u­a­tion that could prove dis­tract­ing at best and po­lit­i­cally and legally per­ilous at worst.</p>
    <p>Un­less Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s De­part­ment of Jus­tice (DOJ) clears Mr Hunter Bi­den of wrong­do­ing be­fore l eav­ing of­fice, the new pres­i­dent will con­front the prospect of his own newly in­stalled ad­min­is­tra­tion de­cid­ing how or whether to pro­ceed with an in­quiry that could ex­pose his son to crim­i­nal pros­e­cu­tion.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, some Repub­li­cans are de­mand­ing that a spe­cial coun­sel be ap­pointed to in­su­late the case from po­lit­i­cal in­flu­ence.</p>
    <p>On the cam­paign trail, Mr Joe Bi­den ex­co­ri­ated Mr Trump’s ef­forts to use the Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion (FBI) and DOJ to go af­ter his en­e­mies and go easy on his friends, vow­ing to re­store a mea­sure of au­ton­omy for law en­force­ment if he won the presidenti­al elec­tion.</p>
    <p>News of the in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the younger Mr Bi­den now fo­cuses even more at­ten­tion on the in­com­ing pres­i­dent’s choice for at­tor­ney-gen­eral, and it will in­evitably raise ques­tions if he ap­points some­one per­ceived as a po­lit­i­cal ally rather than some­one seen as more in­de­pen­dent of the White House.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent-elect has made no com­ment, since his son dis­closed on Wed­nes­day that he had been in­formed about the in­ves­ti­ga­tion be­ing con­ducted by the US at­tor­ney in Delaware, be­yond a state­ment is­sued by his staff ex­press­ing sup­port for his son.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, who has him­self en­gaged in du­bi­ous schemes to avoid pay­ing taxes, in­clud­ing in­stances of out­right fraud, seized on the is­sue to claim that jour­nal­ists and even his own ad­min­is­tra­tion should have re­vealed the Hunter Bi­den in­ves­ti­ga­tion in time to help him win the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“Why didn’t the Fake News Me­dia, the FBI and the DOJ re­port the Bi­den mat­ter be­fore the elec­tion?” he wrote on Twit­ter on Thurs­day, be­fore go­ing on to falsely claim that he won any­way.</p>
    <p>Ei­ther way, the mat­ter now ap­pears likely to hang over Mr Joe Bi­den even as he takes of­fice.</p>
    <p>If he re­fuses to ap­point a spe­cial coun­sel and his Jus­tice De­part­ment opts not to pros­e­cute his son, many will in­vari­ably sus­pect favouritis­m.</p>
    <p>If it does pros­e­cute, then he will face the prospect of see­ing his own son threat­ened with crim­i­nal pros­e­cu­tion.</p>
