    <p>LONDON • Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son, un­der fire over his han­dling of the Covid-19 pan­demic, has vowed to trans­form Bri­tain rather than set­tle for the “sta­tus quo” by build­ing more new homes, im­prov­ing education and boost­ing the green econ­omy.</p>
    <p>In a speech yes­ter­day aimed at ral­ly­ing his Con­ser­va­tive Party, which has be­come in­creas­ingly crit­i­cal of its leader, Mr John­son laid out his vi­sion for a coun­try where deep-rooted in­equal­ity has been ex­posed by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Us­ing his own bat­tle to shed ex­cess weight – which made a bout of Covid-19 more dif­fi­cult to over­come – as a metaphor for chang­ing Bri­tain, he listed the ar­eas he wanted to tackle: hous­ing, education, j obs, cli­mate change and crime.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr John­son of­fered few clues on fund­ing af­ter huge bud­get-bust­ing ex­pen­di­tures to com­bat the pan­demic, and op­po­si­tion par­ties crit­i­cised the speech for be­ing the “usual blus­ter” with scant de­tail on how he would pro­tect jobs or get con­trol over the in­creas­ing num­ber of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain has recorded the high­est Covid-19 death toll in Europe.</p>
    <p>“We’ve been through too much frus­tra­tion and hard­ship just to set­tle for the sta­tus quo and to think that life can go on as it was be­fore the plague,” he said at his party’s an­nual con­fer­ence, held vir­tu­ally this year.</p>
    <p>“It will not, be­cause his­tory teaches us that events of this mag­ni­tude, wars, famines, plagues, events that af­fect the vast bulk of hu­man­ity, as this virus has, they don’t just come and go... We can­not now de­fine the mis­sion of this coun­try as merely to re­store nor­mal­ity. That isn’t good enough.”</p>
    <p>Hit­ting back at crit­ics who say he has both lost con­trol of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic in Bri­tain and strug­gled per­son­ally since suf­fer­ing from Covid-19, Mr John­son said the sug­ges­tion he had lost his “mojo” was “self-ev­i­dent drivel”.</p>
    <p>“The kind of sedi­tious pro­pa­ganda that you’d ex­pect from peo­ple who don’t want this gov­ern­ment to suc­ceed, who wanted to stop us de­liv­er­ing Brexit and all our other man­i­festo pledges,” he said, adding that he was stick­ing with a diet af­ter los­ing 12kg.</p>
    <p>Af­ter be­ing crit­i­cised for pre­sid­ing over a glitch-plagued Covid-19 test­ing sys­tem, giv­ing the pub­lic con­fus­ing guid­ance and re­peat­edly back­track­ing on pol­icy, Mr John­son sought to buoy party mem­bers, many of whom are in­creas­ingly con­cerned just less than a year af­ter the Con­ser­va­tives won a re­sound­ing elec­tion vic­tory.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to re­search pub­lished on Mon­day by for­mer Con­ser­va­tive deputy chair­man Michael Ashcroft, Labour leader Keir Starmer has over­taken Mr John­son as the per­son those polled thought would make a bet­ter prime min­is­ter. Mr John­son’s stand­ing among Con­ser­va­tive Party mem­bers has also plunged, polls show.</p>
    <p>To try to turn the tide, he vowed to curb vi­o­lent crime and pro­tect the justice sys­tem from “lefty hu­man rights lawyers”, while also ac­cus­ing his po­lit­i­cal op­po­nents of try­ing to re­write his­tory, say­ing he was proud to sing Rule Bri­tan­nia.</p>
    <p>For many in the party, it was just the ticket. One Con­ser­va­tive law­maker said Mr John­son had ral­lied the troops while an­other felt that al­though the Prime Min­is­ter looked “tired”, it was good enough.</p>
    <p>Keen to as­sert his green credential­s be­fore Bri­tain hosts the COP26 cli­mate sum­mit next year, Mr John­son promised to cre­ate jobs and make progress to­wards net zero car­bon emis­sions by 2050 by “build­ing back greener” and in­vest­ing in wind power.</p>
    <p>He also pledged to con­struct more homes and make them more ac­ces­si­ble to younger peo­ple, and to im­prove education.</p>
