    <p>Days af­ter Ok­i­nawa pre­fec­ture de­clared a state of emer­gency, the cen­tral Ja­panese pre­fec­ture of Aichi, where Nagoya city is lo­cated, fol­lowed in its foot­steps yes­ter­day amid a surge in Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>Tokyo is also see­ing a sharp rise, prompt­ing Gov­er­nor Yuriko Koike to yes­ter­day urge the cap­i­tal’s res­i­dents to ab­stain from trav­el­ling dur­ing the sum­mer hol­i­days, as have her coun­ter­parts else­where in Ja­pan, as daily records for new in­fec­tions are rou­tinely be­ing shat­tered.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, the na­tional gov­ern­ment is seen as be­ing dawdling and bungling amid Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe’s re­luc­tance to con­vene Diet ses­sions and even hold news con­fer­ences.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe, who met re­porters briefly in Hiroshima yes­ter­day af­ter a cer­e­mony to mark the 75th an­niver­sary of the atomic bomb­ing, in­sisted the coun­try was not at a stage to need an­other state of emer­gency.</p>
    <p>It was his first news con­fer­ence since June 18, and it ended abruptly as he ig­nored ques­tions from re­porters call­ing for greater ac­count­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe said there are now far fewer se­ri­ous cases, with hospi­tals not as bur­dened as they were dur­ing the coun­try’s state of emer­gency from April 7 to May 25.</p>
    <p>“The aim is to pre­vent the spread of in­fec­tions while also keep­ing so­cial and eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties go­ing,” he added. “This is a very dif­fi­cult task, but we must act quickly and nec­es­sar­ily to pro­tect lives and liveli­hoods while avoid­ing the need for an­other state of emer­gency.”</p>
    <p>But these state­ments, re­peated ad nau­seam for weeks by Cab­i­net min­is­ters, have in­creas­ingly sug­gested that the gov­ern­ment is tone-deaf to the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Osaka reg­is­tered a new high of 225 cases yes­ter­day, as did Kana­gawa and Chiba in the Greater Tokyo re­gion, with 119 and 76 in­fec­tions re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Tokyo had 360 cases yes­ter­day, the 10th day in a row it has recorded more than 200 cases. Its 14,645 in­fec­tions ac­count for about onethird of Ja­pan’s more than 44,000 cases.</p>
    <p>In sharp con­trast to the day the state of emer­gency was lifted on May 25, when there were just 21 cases in the en­tire coun­try, yes­ter­day saw 1,473 cases as at 8pm.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe’s Cab­i­net sup­port has hit new lows. A poll by Ja­pan News Net­work on Mon­day showed ap­proval at just 35.4 per cent, with sup­port for his gov­ern­ment’s han­dling of the cri­sis plung­ing 20 per­cent­age points from last month to 26 per cent.</p>
    <p>The Prime Min­is­ter has said it was not nec­es­sary for him to ad­dress the na­tion on Covid-19 is­sues, pass­ing the buck to Health Min­is­ter Kat­sunobu Kato, Econ­omy Min­is­ter Ya­su­toshi Nishimura and Chief Cab­i­net Sec­re­tary Yoshi­hide Suga.</p>
    <p>He has also re­sisted calls to re­open the Diet.</p>
    <p>Mr Jun Azumi, the Diet Af­fairs Chief of the op­po­si­tion Con­sti­tu­tional Demo­cratic Party of Ja­pan, said: “This on­go­ing coro­n­avirus cri­sis is not some­thing that can be over­come by leav­ing the mat­ter to oth­ers or rel­e­vant Cab­i­net min­is­ters. It’s in­com­pre­hen­si­ble as to why a coun­try’s leader doesn’t pro­vide an ex­pla­na­tion to the peo­ple, in­clud­ing at the Diet.”</p>
    <p>Mr Abe has not is­sued any travel ad­vi­sories for the sum­mer va­ca­tion and over the up­com­ing Bon fes­ti­val, when mil­lions of Ja­panese tra­di­tion­ally re­turn to their home towns.</p>
    <p>“We hope a new and safe style of travel will take root in Ja­pan in the era of Covid-19,” he said, adding that travel should con­tinue but with the nec­es­sary safe­guards.</p>
    <p>This is in con­trast to lo­cal lead­ers such as Ms Koike and Aichi Gov­er­nor Hideaki Omura, who said yes­ter­day: “Dur­ing the sum­mer va­ca­tion... we would like all res­i­dents to re­strain their be­hav­iour and try to dras­ti­cally curb virus in­fec­tions.”</p>
    <p>Shizuoka Gov­er­nor Heita Kawakatsu added: “Please re­think if your fam­ily vis­its re­ally must take place now.”</p>
