    <p>Noth­ing ex­cites me as much as wan­der­ing through su­per­mar­kets, go­ing down ev­ery aisle and pick­ing out things I want to eat and drink.</p>
    <p>I find much to love at FairPrice Down­town East and FairPrice Finest at Artra, a con­do­minium de­vel­op­ment in the Alexan­dra Road area. Come ex­plore th­ese su­per­mar­kets with me, as I look for posh nosh at FairPrice. 1. Ind­o­food</p>
    <p>Bal­ado Merah and Bal­ado Hi­jau (right, $4.20 for a 200g pouch)</p>
    <p>2. Uleg Sam­bal Terasi (be­low right;</p>
    <p>$3.50 for 10 sa­chets of 20g each)</p>
    <p>FAIRPRICE DOWN­TOWN EAST</p>
    <p>This huge su­per­mar­ket was re­cently ren­o­vated, and is now big­ger, to take in a Unity phar­macy. My jaw drops at the range. What catches my eye: a tray of live hairy crabs, a big se­lec­tion of mala and other spicy condi­ments, and Woh Hup’s new range of sauces. Where: 02-127 e!Hub, Down­town East, 1 Pasir Ris Close Open: 8am to 11pm daily</p>
    <p>Find th­ese in the ha­lal sec­tion, which has a huge se­lec­tion of es­sen­tials, sauces, condi­ments, bak­ing prod­ucts and snacks. Th­ese sauces are made in In­done­sia, and are feisty and punchy – they do not hold back on the heat. But even a chilli coward like me can ap­pre­ci­ate how good they taste and how easy they are to use.</p>
    <p>Have the sam­bal terasi with nasi lemak, grilled fish or fried chicken, but a great way to use it is to spread some on a slice of bread, slap cheese on top and toast un­til bub­bly.</p>
    <p>The pos­si­bil­i­ties for the be­lado sauces are end­less. I pre­fer the hi­jau – it has fresh­ness and nu­ance, and does not make my head ex­plode from heat. I would mar­i­nate lamb chops with this and bar­be­cue them.</p>
    <p>The merah ver­sion is su­per spicy. Use it as a base for a dif­fer­ent kind of na­chos. Stir-fry onions and minced beef with the sauce and spoon over tor­tilla chips, blan­ket with a mix of shred­ded moz­zarella and ched­dar, bake un­til golden brown and tuck in.</p>
    <p>3. Vit’s Ital­ian Mi Goreng Aglio Olio</p>
    <p>($3.45 for a pack of four)</p>
    <p>I have seen – and eaten – many ver­sions of in­stant noo­dles, but Ital­ian mee goreng? Vit’s from Malaysia is of­fer­ing some­thing very dif­fer­ent. The olive oil could be bet­ter, but there is noth­ing wrong with the springy tex­ture of the noo­dles or the pouch of de­hy­drated veg­eta­bles, which spring mag­i­cally to life when tossed with hot noo­dles. There is just enough chilli to ex­cite – but not paral­yse – the taste buds and a gen­tle kick from gar­lic.</p>
    <p>For some­thing more fancy, the noo­dles come in an­other flavour: Bolog­nese Ital­ian Mi Goreng.</p>
    <p>4. Vi­etJoy Tea</p>
    <p>($15 for a box of 20 teabags)</p>
    <p>This brand is a col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Viet­nam, and in­volves Nanyang Polytech­nic, Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore and Saigon Tech­nol­ogy Uni­ver­sity. The idea is to show­case Viet­nam’s pro­duce and help farm­ers there earn ex­tra in­come.</p>
    <p>I could go on about the sup­posed health ben­e­fits of tea made with moringa, mul­berry, sour­sop and guava leaves, but noth­ing will make me drink them un­less they taste good. My pick is moringa (above), with its fra­grant, herbal flavour. It tastes al­most like nori sea­weed.</p>
    <p>This is the new­est FairPrice Finest su­per­mar­ket and it has an up­mar­ket feel, in keep­ing with the swanky con­do­mini­ums in the area. Half the store is de­voted to fresh and frozen food, com­pared with 30 to 40 per cent in other su­per­mar­kets. Shop­ping here is a lit­tle like wan­der­ing through a farm­ers’ mar­ket, with beau­ti­ful dis­plays of fruit and veg­eta­bles.</p>
    <p>When I went, there was a gor­geous Hal­loween dis­play near the en­trance. If you are plan­ning a party, ask for help from the store’s concierge, who can help you put to­gether a feast. There are also Fresh Am­bas­sadors on hand to help you pick the ripest, sweet­est fruit.</p>
    <p>Where: 01-18 Artra, 10 Alexan­dra View (next to Red­hill MRT sta­tion) Open: 8am to 11pm daily</p>
    <p>1. Gul­lon Gluten Free Crack­ers ($4.90 for a 200g box)</p>
    <p>FairPrice at Artra car­ries a well-cu­rated range of prod­ucts for those with food al­ler­gies and in­tol­er­ances.</p>
    <p>But I would get th­ese any­way be­cause they taste good. Th­ese savoury crack­ers, with a smidgen of sweet­ness, are made with corn, potato and rice starches.</p>
    <p>They are phe­nom­e­nally crisp and make good blank can­vasses for jam, peanut but­ter, smoked salmon and sour cream, pate or char­cu­terie.</p>
    <p>2. ComCrop Sweet Basil</p>
    <p>($3.95 for 50g)</p>
    <p>Grown in Sin­ga­pore, on rooftops – basil does not come fresher than this.</p>
    <p>I made a pesto, to go with zuc­chini noo­dles and to work into the dough of a tomato bread I’m work­ing on.</p>
    <p>You will, of course, find pine nuts, olive oil and parme­san cheese in the store.</p>
    <p>3. Hook Cof­fee Cherry Bomb Drip Cof­fee Bags</p>
    <p>($18 for a box of 10 bags)</p>
    <p>I start my morn­ings with a cuppa and I’m go­ing to want Cherry Bomb ev­ery day. This is de­spite the fact that it is made with Ethiopian beans and I usu­ally find them way too bright for early in the morn­ing.</p>
    <p>Not this one. I don’t have to wear sun­glasses. It has a touch of acid, but then the cherry starts bomb­ing the palate. Juicy.</p>
    <p>Okay, I’m go­ing to make my­self a sec­ond cup. And en­joy read­ing the funny copy on the box of this Sin­ga­porean brand of cof­fee.</p>

    <p>Posh Nosh is brought to you by FairPrice.</p>
