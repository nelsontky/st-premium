    <p>Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son said no Bri­tish prime min­is­ter could ac­cept the Euro­pean Union’s Brexit de­mands as he was head­ing to Brus­sels for a show­down with the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion’s Ur­sula von der Leyen yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The face-to-face con­ver­sa­tion be­tween Mr John­son and the Com­mis­sion pres­i­dent is an at­tempt to in­ject po­lit­i­cal i mpe­tus i nto the stalled ne­go­ti­a­tions.</p>
    <p>If it goes well, ne­go­tia­tors could be back in a room ham­mer­ing out the de­tails within hours.</p>
    <p>If it goes badly, of­fi­cials on both sides fear the chances of a deal be­ing ready be­fore the end of this month – when the Brexit tran­si­tion pe­riod ends – will fade away.</p>
    <p>“Our friends in the EU are cur­rently in­sist­ing that if they pass a new law in the fu­ture with which we in this coun­try do not com­ply or don’t fol­low suit, then they want the au­to­matic right to pun­ish us and to re­tal­i­ate,” Mr John­son told mem­bers of Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>“They’re say­ing we should be the only coun­try in the world not to have sov­er­eign con­trol over its fish­ing wa­ters. I don’t be­lieve that those are terms any prime min­is­ter of this coun­try should ac­cept.”</p>
    <p>He also said “a good deal is still there to be done” and that he was look­ing for­ward to dis­cussing it with Dr von der Leyen at din­ner.</p>
    <p>The main stick­ing points in the Brexit stale­mate have been over fish­ing rights in Bri­tish wa­ters, en­sur­ing fair com­pe­ti­tion for com­pa­nies on either side and ways to solve fu­ture dis­putes.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son’s meet­ing with Dr von der Leyen won’t be a ne­go­ti­a­tion, but rather “a con­ver­sa­tion be­tween two po­lit­i­cal lead­ers try­ing to as­sess where they both stand,” Mr John­son’s press sec­re­tary Al­le­gra Strat­ton told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“The Prime Min­is­ter is go­ing to be clear this evening that he can’t ac­cept any­thing that un­der­mines our abil­ity to con­trol our laws or con­trol our wa­ters.”</p>
    <p>Ms Strat­ton also stressed that the UK won’t ex­tend the ne­go­ti­a­tions into 2021.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to Mr John­son’s speech, EU Fi­nan­cial Ser­vices Com­mis­sioner Mairead McGuin­ness said yes­ter­day that the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion is pre­par­ing spe­cific and very nar­rowly fo­cused con­tin­gency plans to pre­pare for the pos­si­bil­ity of a no-deal Brexit.</p>
    <p>“I think there is a fail­ure to un­der­stand, which per­haps is a fail­ure of Brexit at the very out­set, if you choose to leave, there are con­se­quences, par­tic­u­larly where that coun­try wants to stay part of the sin­gle mar­ket,” she added on the chances of a trade deal.</p>
    <p>Fail­ure to reach a deal by Dec 31 would af­fect the US$1 tril­lion (S$1.33 tril­lion) in an­nual trade from tar­iffs and quo­tas and sow chaos through sup­ply chains across Europe and be­yond.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son por­trays Brexit as a chance to give Bri­tain an in­de­pen­dent and more ag­ile econ­omy.</p>
    <p>EU pow­ers fear Lon­don wants the best of both worlds – pref­er­en­tial ac­cess to EU mar­kets but with the ad­van­tage of be­ing able to set its own rules.</p>
    <p>Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel said: “We must have a level play­ing field, not just for to­day but for to­mor­row and be­yond, and for that we must agree how we can re­act when the other changes his le­gal sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“Oth­er­wise, un­fair com­pe­ti­tion con­di­tions arise to which we can­not sub­ject our com­pa­nies.”</p>
    <p>Bri­tain said on Tues­day it had clinched a deal with the EU that would ex­empt as much as 98 per cent of goods flow­ing be­tween Bri­tain and North­ern Ire­land from tar­iffs from Jan 1.</p>
    <p>But in an in­ter­view with the Ir­ish Times, Prime Min­is­ter Micheal Martin said he is “on the pes­simistic side” about the prospects for a deal.</p>
