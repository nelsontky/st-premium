    <p>WASHINGTON • US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump sought to dis­pel any per­cep­tion of weak­ness on Sun­day with a sur­prise out­ing from his hos­pi­tal bed to greet sup­port­ers, even as his doc­tors again rewrote the of­fi­cial nar­ra­tive of his ill­ness by re­veal­ing two alarm­ing episodes they had pre­vi­ously not dis­closed.</p>
    <p>The doc­tors said Mr Trump’s blood oxy­gen level dropped twice in the two days af­ter he was di­ag­nosed with Covid-19, re­quir­ing med­i­cal in­ter­ven­tion, and that he had been put on steroids, sug­gest­ing his con­di­tion may be more se­ri­ous than de­scribed. But they in­sisted his sit­u­a­tion had im­proved enough since, and that he could be dis­charged as early as yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The episodes raised new ques­tions about the cred­i­bil­ity of the in­for­ma­tion pro­vided about the Pres­i­dent. Of­fi­cials have ac­knowl­edged pro­vid­ing rosy as­sess­ments to sat­isfy their prickly pa­tient.</p>
    <p>De­ter­mined to re­assert him­self on the po­lit­i­cal stage, Mr Trump made an unan­nounced exit from Wal­ter Reed Na­tional Mil­i­tary Med­i­cal Cen­tre on Sun­day evening, rid­ing past sup­port­ers in his ar­moured Chevro­let Sub­ur­ban. Masked, he waved at the crowd through a closed win­dow.</p>
    <p>“It’s been a very in­ter­est­ing jour­ney,” he said in a minute-long video on Twit­ter, sound­ing more en­er­getic than he had been in the last couple of days. “I learned a lot about Covid... and I’m go­ing to be let­ting you know about it.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s morale-boost­ing visit may have masked the re­al­ity of his con­di­tion, and his seem­ing en­ergy may have re­flected the fact that he was given the steroid dex­am­etha­sone, health ex­perts said.</p>
    <p>Dex­am­etha­sone has been shown to help pa­tients who are se­verely ill with Covid-19, but it is typ­i­cally not used in mild cases.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery sin­gle per­son in the ve­hi­cle dur­ing that com­pletely un­nec­es­sary Pres­i­den­tial ‘drive-by’ just now has to be quar­an­tined for 14 days,” Dr James Phillips, an at­tend­ing physi­cian at Wal­ter Reed, tweeted. “Com­manded by Trump to put their lives at risk for the­atre. This is in­san­ity.”</p>
    <p>Dr Phillips said the trip raised the ques­tion of whether the Pres­i­dent was di­rect­ing his doc­tors.</p>
    <p>“Were those doc­tors or­dered to al­low this to hap­pen?” he asked, not­ing that it vi­o­lated stan­dards of care and would not be an op­tion open to any other pa­tient.</p>
    <p>White House spokesman Judd Deere said pre­cau­tions were taken in or­gan­is­ing the ex­cur­sion.</p>
    <p>But the crit­i­cism threat­ened to re­in­force views of Mr Trump’s han­dling of the pan­demic as a whole, which has been widely crit­i­cised and re­mains his big­gest po­lit­i­cal vul­ner­a­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Two of­fi­cials speak­ing on con­di­tion of anonymity ac­knowl­edged that Mr Trump had an undis­closed pos­i­tive re­sult from a rapid test last Thurs­day af­ter re­turn­ing from a fund-raiser in New Jersey. But he did not re­veal it when he called into Mr Sean Han­nity’s Fox News show and, in a raspy voice, said he was still wait­ing for re­sults.</p>
    <p>Only af­ter the TV show did the re­sults of an­other, more so­phis­ti­cated PCR test come back con­firm­ing the pos­i­tive read­ing, said the of­fi­cials. It was that later test re­sult that Mr Trump an­nounced on Twit­ter around 1am on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Each pass­ing day brings new in­for­ma­tion about those early hours of the ill­ness that con­tra­dicts the ver­sion of events orig­i­nally put out by the White House.</p>
    <p>Dr Sean Con­ley, the White House physi­cian, ac­knowl­edged on Sun­day that Mr Trump had a high fever and had seen his oxy­gen drop on Fri­day. That episode prompted the de­ci­sion to trans­fer Mr Trump to the hos­pi­tal, a move ini­tially de­scribed by the White House as sim­ply a pre­cau­tion.</p>
    <p>Dr Con­ley and other doc­tors were nonethe­less op­ti­mistic on Sun­day that Mr Trump was do­ing bet­ter and could soon be sent back to con­va­lesce at the White House.</p>
    <p>But ad­vis­ers were also trou­bled by the doc­tors’ pre­dic­tion that they might re­lease him yes­ter­day, be­cause if they do not, it would sig­nal that the Pres­i­dent is not do­ing as well as in­di­cated.</p>
    <p>They also wor­ried that a pre­ma­ture re­turn could lead to a sec­ond trip to the hos­pi­tal if his con­di­tion wors­ened.</p>
