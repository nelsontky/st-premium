    <p>The over­all pay­ment per­for­mance of Sin­ga­pore firms hit an all-time low last year amid the eco­nomic fall­out from the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The an­nual av­er­age pro­por­tion of prompt pay­ments fell to less than half of to­tal pay­ment trans­ac­tions, to 40.74 per cent last year, from 49.05 per cent in 2019, the Sin­ga­pore Com­mer­cial Credit Bureau (SCCB) said in a quar­terly re­port yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age pro­por­tion of slow pay­ments rose to 44.72 per cent in 2020, from 37.68 per cent in 2019. Mean­while, par­tial pay­ments hit an all-time high in 2020 at 14.54 per cent, up from 13.27 per cent in 2019.</p>
    <p>Prompt pay­ments i n last year’s Q4 inched up by 2.9 per­cent­age points to 41.3 per cent, from 38.4 per cent in the quar­ter be­fore. Year on year, prompt pay­ments fell by 4.9 per­cent­age points from 46.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>Slow pay­ments were down by one per­cent­age point to 43.2 per cent in the fourth quar­ter, from 44.2 per cent in the third quar­ter, and rose by 3.4 per­cent­age points from 39.8 per cent the year be­fore.</p>
    <p>Par­tial pay­ments dipped by 1.9 per­cent­age points to 15.6 per cent in Q4, from 17.5 per cent in Q3, and rose by 1.5 per­cent­age points from 14 per cent in the fourth quar­ter of 2019.</p>
    <p>All five sec­tors saw slight im­prove­ments in slow pay­ments quar­ter on quar­ter. But slow pay­ments de­te­ri­o­rated across all in­dus­tries year on year.</p>
    <p>The con­struc­tion sec­tor saw the high­est pro­por­tion of slow pay­ments – ac­count­ing for more than half of pay­ment trans­ac­tions in the fourth quar­ter. The other sec­tors – man­u­fac­tur­ing, re­tail, ser­vices and whole­sale trade – saw de­creases in slow pay­ments.</p>
    <p>D&B Sin­ga­pore chief ex­ec­u­tive Au­drey Chia said: “Although the Sin­ga­pore econ­omy is ex­pected to re­turn to growth this year, we an­tic­i­pate the con­tin­u­ing trend of im­prove­ment in pay­ment per­for­mance to be grad­ual af­ter hit­ting an all-time low in 2020.”</p>
    <p>D&B Sin­ga­pore com­piled the fig­ures in the re­port by mon­i­tor­ing, through the SCCB, more than 2.4 mil­lion pay­ment trans­ac­tions of firms.</p>
    <p>Prompt pay­ment is when 90 per cent or more of to­tal bills are paid within the agreed pay­ment terms, while slow pay­ment is when less than 50 per cent of to­tal bills are paid within the agreed terms. And par­tial pay­ment is when be­tween 50 per cent and 90 per cent of to­tal bills are paid within the agreed terms.</p>
