    <p>Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings (SPH) will be lay­ing off 140 em­ploy­ees from its me­dia sales and mag­a­zines op­er­a­tions as it ad­dresses the im­pact Covid-19 has had on ad­ver­tis­ing rev­enues.</p>
    <p>The re­trench­ments will af­fect about 5 per cent of its Me­dia Group’s head­count, and is part of its me­dia trans­for­ma­tion road map, it said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Af­fected staff will re­ceive com­pen­sa­tion on terms ne­go­ti­ated and agreed with the Cre­ative Me­dia and Pub­lish­ing Union.</p>
    <p>SPH has also been work­ing closely with the union and e2i – NTUC’s Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute which matches work­ers to jobs – to en­sure that they get the help and sup­port they need dur­ing this pe­riod, the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>SPH chief ex­ec­u­tive Ng Yat Chung said that the eco­nomic down­turn has sig­nif­i­cantly im­pacted SPH’s ad­ver­tis­ing rev­enue, al­though sub­scrip­tions and read­er­ship of the group’s news ti­tles have in­creased since the on­set of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal cir­cu­la­tion of its news ti­tles, in­clud­ing The Straits Times, has grown 52.6 per cent so far this year, com­pared with a year ago, boost­ing over­all cir­cu­la­tion of these ti­tles by 9.8 per cent in the same pe­riod. News­room staff and jour­nal­ists are not af­fected by this ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng said: “A more in­te­grated ap­proach of pro­duc­ing and sell­ing our con­tent across our var­i­ous plat­forms will al­low us to deal more ef­fi­ciently and ef­fec­tively with the new level of demand we are see­ing from our ad­ver­tis­ers and au­di­ence.”</p>
    <p>Be­sides me­dia, SPH is in prop­erty, pur­pose-built stu­dent ac­com­mo­da­tion and nurs­ing homes. It owns malls such as Paragon, Cle­menti Mall and the Rail Mall.</p>
    <p>Last year, the com­pany started a re­view of its me­dia busi­ness to pro­vide ad­ver­tis­ers with more ef­fec­tive mar­ket­ing solutions by adopt­ing an in­te­grated sales ap­proach across its dif­fer­ent plat­forms and ti­tles, the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>SPH had brought to­gether the spe­cial­ist ap­peal of its magazine ti­tles and ra­dio au­di­ences with the broader mass mar­ket au­di­ences of its news­pa­per ti­tles, and rolled out self-ser­vice op­tions for ad­ver­tis­ers to cus­tomise their cam­paigns.</p>
    <p>SPH has also in­ten­si­fied its ef­forts to share its con­tent re­sources across its print, dig­i­tal and voice plat­forms, the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>It added: “The stream­lin­ing of op­er­a­tions for greater ef­fi­ciency and syn­ergy has led to the re­dun­dancy of some roles.”</p>
    <p>SPH said yes­ter­day that it has ex­ited its magazine busi­ness i n Malaysia, and that Cleo and Young Par­ents mag­a­zines have ceased pub­li­ca­tion. The re­trench­ment ex­er­cise will cost about $8 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Last year, the com­pany shed 130 jobs from the group’s me­dia solutions di­vi­sion, mag­a­zines and smaller sub­sidiaries to rein in costs. In 2017, it trimmed 130 jobs, which af­fected news­rooms and its In­te­grated Mar­ket­ing Di­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>Asked if there will be more lay­offs, an SPH spokesman said: “There are none planned, and the fo­cus is on ex­e­cut­ing the trans­for­ma­tion plan to make sure the busi</p>
    <p>A more in­te­grated ap­proach of pro­duc­ing and sell­ing our con­tent across our var­i­ous plat­forms will al­low us to deal more ef­fi­ciently and ef­fec­tively with the new level of demand we are see­ing from our ad­ver­tis­ers and au­di­ence.</p>

    <p>ness con­tin­ues to be sus­tain­able. How­ever, it will also be de­pen­dent on when the econ­omy re­cov­ers.”</p>
    <p>The com­pany noted that since the Covid-19 pan­demic, it has re­viewed its costs, cut back on dis­cre­tionary spend­ing and in­sti­tuted pay cuts for se­nior man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>In March, SPH an­nounced that its di­rec­tors, in­clud­ing the CEO, and se­nior man­age­ment would take vol­un­tary pay cuts of 10 per cent and 5 per cent re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>SPH shares closed down 0.89 per cent at $1.11 yes­ter­day, be­fore the an­nounce­ment was made.</p>
