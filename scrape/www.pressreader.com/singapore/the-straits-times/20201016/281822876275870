    <p>Kyr­gyz Pres­i­dent Sooron­bai Jeen­bekov re­signed yes­ter­day after days of un­rest fol­low­ing a dis­puted elec­tion, say­ing he wanted to pre­vent clashes be­tween se­cu­rity forces and pro­test­ers who have de­manded his re­moval from of­fice.</p>
    <p>He be­comes the third pres­i­dent of the small Cen­tral Asian nation since 2005 to be top­pled in a pop­u­lar up­ris­ing.</p>
    <p>Kyr­gyzs­tan, a Rus­sian ally that bor­ders China, has been in tur­moil since the Oct 4 par­lia­men­tary elec­tion, which the op­po­si­tion re­jected after Mr Jeen­bekov’s al­lies were de­clared the win­ners.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, Mr Jeen­bekov said he feared vi­o­lence might break out if pro­test­ers carry out a threat to march on his com­pound.</p>
    <p>“The mil­i­tary and se­cu­rity forces will be obliged to use their weapons to pro­tect the state res­i­dence. Blood will be in­evitably shed. I urge both sides not to fall for provo­ca­tions,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I do not want to go down in Kyr­gyzs­tan’s his­tory as a pres­i­dent who shed blood and shot at his own cit­i­zens.”</p>
    <p>After the elec­tion, op­po­si­tion sup­port­ers took to the streets and seized gov­ern­ment build­ings, prompt­ing the au­thor­i­ties to an­nul the vote.</p>
    <p>Mr Jeen­bekov an­nounced last week that he would re­sign, but this week he de­layed his exit, say­ing he would stay in of­fice un­til a new elec­tion was held.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, Mr Jeen­bekov ac­cepted Par­lia­ment’s choice of Mr Sadyr Ja­parov – a na­tion­al­ist whose sup­port­ers freed him from pri­son last week – for prime min­is­ter. Mr Ja­parov and his fol­low­ers have de­manded Mr Jeen­bekov leave of­fice.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing Mr Jeen­bekov’s res­ig­na­tion, Par­lia­ment Speaker Kanat­bek Isayev would as­sume pres­i­den­tial pow­ers. Should he also re­sign, the pow­ers would trans­fer to Mr Ja­parov.</p>
