    <p>The tourism in­dus­try must be pre­pared for a long win­ter as in­ter­na­tional travel could take three to five years to re­turn to pre-pan­demic lev­els, even if a vac­cine for the coronaviru­s is de­vel­oped soon.</p>
    <p>But busi­nesses can­not go into hi­ber­na­tion mode if Sin­ga­pore is to come roar­ing back as a top des­ti­na­tion for high-value tourists when the sit­u­a­tion be­gins to nor­malise.</p>
    <p>This was the stark mes­sage from Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board’s (STB) chief ex­ec­u­tive Keith Tan to in­dus­try mem­bers at a vir­tual roundtable ses­sion yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Echo­ing the bleak out­look, As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore At­trac­tions (ASA) chair­man Kevin Cheong urged op­er­a­tors that are barely hang­ing on to cut their losses.</p>
    <p>“If you think the light at the end of the tun­nel is around the cor­ner, this is not a cor­ner. It is a huge turn­pike,” said Dr Cheong.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said the Gov­ern­ment will do its best to aid the in­dus­try, such as by stim­u­lat­ing lo­cal de­mand. He also urged firms to de­velop of­fer­ings that can help dif­fer­en­ti­ate Sin­ga­pore as a travel des­ti­na­tion, say­ing that sup­port will be avail­able to sus­tain these ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“We need to be pre­pared for trav­ellers who are look­ing for more exclusive, smaller-scale or spe­cial ex­pe­ri­ences that are hard to find else­where be­cause we be­lieve that in the years af­ter Covid-19, peo­ple will not be trav­el­ling so fre­quently,” he said.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses will have to be cre­ative in com­ing up with new rev­enue streams in the in­terim, and some may have to re­po­si­tion or pivot their busi­ness to sur­vive, he noted.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the two-hour ses­sion, in­dus­try lead­ers across sec­tors such as ho­tels, re­tail and at­trac­tions spoke about the chal­lenges they face amid the tourist drought and safe dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions, as well as the need to col­lab­o­rate and to im­prove ser­vice lev­els.</p>
    <p>Sus­tained border clo­sures have put the ho­tel in­dus­try here in a “crit­i­cal fi­nan­cial cri­sis” as in­ter­na­tional tourism con­trib­utes to about 90 per cent of rev­enue, said Ms Margaret Heng, ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of the Sin­ga­pore Ho­tel As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>While the pan­demic has has­tened the adop­tion of con­tact­less guest touch­points and on­line shop­ping, the per­sonal touch will re­main key for the hos­pi­tal­ity and re­tail in­dus­tries, pan­el­lists said.</p>
    <p>Better ser­vice in stores is also needed if re­tail­ers are to give shop­pers in­cen­tive to visit bricks-and­mor­tar out­lets, said Sin­ga­pore Re­tail­ers As­so­ci­a­tion ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor Rose Tong. “If a shop­per steps into the store and is not well treated and not served, then they might as well shop on­line,” she said.</p>
    <p>Re­tail staff should thus be trained in con­ver­sa­tional and soft skills to better en­gage cus­tomers, Ms Tong said.</p>
    <p>And when it comes to vis­it­ing leisure at­trac­tions at home, lo­cals tend to be lethar­gic, but they are gen­er­ally will­ing to pay more while over­seas, said ASA’s Dr Cheong.</p>
    <p>Op­er­a­tors will have to better study and cater to the lo­cal mar­ket to con­vince Sin­ga­pore­ans to spend on tick­eted ac­tiv­i­ties here, he said.</p>
    <p>“We need to de­velop our own unique con­tent, own lo­cal sto­ries and re­ally pull at the heart­strings of our guests.”</p>
    <p>When in­ter­na­tional travel does re­sume, travel agents may see a resur­gence, with hol­i­day­mak­ers seek­ing guid­ance on coun­try re­quire­ments and more struc­tured itin­er­ar­ies, said Mr Steven Ler, pres­i­dent of the Na­tional As­so­ci­a­tion of Travel Agents Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>There is also scope for cross-sec­tor col­lab­o­ra­tion, he said, adding: “Peo­ple whom you never thought are pos­si­ble to work with will po­ten­tially be your strength to dif­fer­en­ti­ate your prod­uct.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Or­chard Road Busi­ness As­so­ci­a­tion (Orba) chair­man Mark Shaw said ca­pac­ity lim­its have made sur­vival a strug­gle for busi­nesses de­signed for much larger crowds at Sin­ga­pore’s premier shop­ping belt.</p>
    <p>But the pan­demic presents a good op­por­tu­nity for Or­chard Road to better utilise its street space, he said.</p>
    <p>“We re­ally do need to all pull to­gether to make sure that busi­nesses sur­vive, even as we re­tool and as we re­think how we do our busi­ness,” he said.</p>
    <p>This year’s Or­chard Road Christ­mas light-up will go ahead with scaled-down ac­tiv­i­ties in the light of safe dis­tanc­ing reg­u­la­tions, Orba said yes­ter­day. More de­tails are ex­pected early next month.</p>
