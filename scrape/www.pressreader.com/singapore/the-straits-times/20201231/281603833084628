    <p>ter­wards to en­sure that they tol­er­ated it well.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing NCID staff will be pro­gres­sively vac­ci­nated, with the rest of the Na­tional Health­care Group man­age­ment and staff from next month.</p>
    <p>Dr Kal­is­var, who read the reg­u­la­tory re­ports and at­tended the town halls at hos­pi­tals on the vac­cine, is con­fi­dent of the prod­uct, about which he said pa­tients had many ques­tions.</p>
    <p>“I think it is only rea­son­able that they feel con­cerned,” he said. “Be­cause it is such an im­por­tant vac­cine, even small prob­lems may be high­lighted a lot in the news.</p>
    <p>“As a doc­tor, it is my job to al­le­vi­ate some of these con­cerns that pa­tients have. And these are real con­cerns.”</p>
    <p>Tran­sient ef­fects of the vac­ci­na­tion can be al­le­vi­ated, he said, for in­stance by tak­ing a Panadol for any pain that might fol­low the jab.</p>
    <p>In fact, pain is some­thing which peo­ple should feel as it shows that the body is re­act­ing to the vac­cine, he added.</p>
    <p>Dr Kal­is­var also ad­dressed con­cerns about re­ported ana­phy­laxis re­ac­tion to the vac­cines.</p>
    <p>“It’s so rare and I know that ana­phy­laxis is eas­ily treat­able with an in­jec­tion. I know they’re go­ing to mon­i­tor me after the vac­ci­na­tion, be­cause usu­ally ana­phy­laxis hap­pens im­me­di­ately after the vac­ci­na­tion,” he added.</p>
    <p>First to get the jab was NCID se­nior staff nurse Sarah Lim, 46, whose job is to screen sus­pected Covid-19 cases. She said the in­jec­tion was like an ant bite.</p>
    <p>“I am feel­ing fine...,” she told re­porters. “I feel grate­ful and thank­ful for be­ing the first to be vac­ci­nated. I would en­cour­age (oth­ers) to go for it.”</p>
    <p>She added i n Man­darin: “I wanted to take the in­jec­tion to pro­tect my­self, my loved ones, (my) pa­tients and the public.”</p>
    <p>The i njec­tion was given at 9.24am by se­nior staff nurse Kho Wei Lian, 26. It was re­moved from the fridge at NCID at 8.30am – ac­cord­ing to a note on the wall – and de­liv­ered about 45 min­utes later.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine needs to be at room tem­per­a­ture for 30 min­utes be­fore it is di­luted. Only a small vol­ume, or just 0.3ml, is in­jected. The vac­cine vial, once opened, must be used within six hours.</p>
    <p>Third in line to get vac­ci­nated was se­nior staff nurse Mo­hamed Fir­daus Mo­hamed Salleh, 38.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine will give him con­fi­dence when he car­ries out his du­ties, said Mr Fir­daus who works in the in­ten­sive care unit look­ing after Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>“This also gives me the as­sur­ance that I can go home safely to my kids,” said the father of four.</p>
    <p>He did not ex­pe­ri­ence any side ef­fects, and com­mended the ef­fi­cient and smooth work­flow.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine re­quires two in­jec­tions, given 21 days apart. Those who got their shots yes­ter­day will re­turn for a sec­ond dose on Jan 20.</p>
