    <p>Armed pi­rates struck at three ships in the east­bound lane of the Sin­ga­pore Strait within a span of six hours over Sun­day and yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>As the per­pe­tra­tors have not been caught, they may strike again, said the Re­gional Co­op­er­a­tion Agree­ment on Com­bat­ing Piracy and Armed Rob­bery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP) In­for­ma­tion Shar­ing Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>There was no con­fronta­tion dur­ing the in­ci­dents and none of the crew were in­jured, it added.</p>
    <p>Ship equip­ment was stolen from one ves­sel, and a lifebuoy from an­other, while noth­ing was taken from the third ship.</p>
    <p>The lat­est armed in­ci­dents take the to­tal num­ber of such at­tacks this year in the Sin­ga­pore Strait to 31, the same num­ber of in­ci­dents for the whole of last year.</p>
    <p>The first oc­curred at 9.25pm on Sun­day, as tanker Zeno was trav­el­ling near Tan­jung Bu­lat in East Jo­hor, Malaysia. Three pi­rates were spot­ted in the en­gine room.</p>
    <p>Shipping equip­ment, in­clud­ing a sound­ing rod and a por­ta­ble breath­ing ap­pa­ra­tus, were later found stolen from the en­gine room.</p>
    <p>At 2.20am yes­ter­day, two pi­rates were spot­ted near the en­gine room on bulk car­rier Le­fkada, which was trav­el­ling near Tan­jung Ra­mu­nia in East Jo­hor, Malaysia.</p>
    <p>The alarm was raised and a search of the ship con­ducted, but the in­trud­ers could not be found.</p>
    <p>The oil spill equip­ment locker was found un­locked and a life buoy had been stolen.</p>
    <p>And at 3.08am, one pi­rate was seen near the steer­ing gear com­part­ment on bulk car­rier At­lantic Diana, which was near Tan­jung Pergam in Pu­lau Bin­tan, In­done­sia. The crew searched the ship but could not find the in­truder. They found noth­ing stolen.</p>
    <p>ReCAAP warned: “All ships are ad­vised to ex­er­cise ut­most vig­i­lance, adopt ex­tra pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures and re­port all in­ci­dents im­me­di­ately to the near­est coastal state.”</p>
    <p>It also ad­vised lit­toral states to in­crease their pa­trols and en­force­ment, and to in­crease co­or­di­na­tion and in­for­ma­tion shar­ing to ap­pre­hend the per­pe­tra­tors.</p>
