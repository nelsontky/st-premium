    <p>Sin­ga­pore Post (SingPost) posted a net profit of $30.9 mil­lion for the first half of the fis­cal year ended Septem­ber, down 42.1 per cent from $53.4 mil­lion in the cor­re­spond­ing pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Earn­ings per share fell to 1.04 cents, down from 2.57 cents a year ago.</p>
    <p>In a bourse fil­ing yes­ter­day, the group at­trib­uted the de­cline in bot­tom line fig­ures to a “sharp rise” in in­ter­na­tional con­veyance costs and labour-re­lated ex­penses due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The fall in net profit was de­spite a 9.6 per cent in­crease in rev­enue to $707.8 mil­lion from $645.6 mil­lion l ast year, spear­headed by growth in the group’s post and parcel as well as lo­gis­tics seg­ments.</p>
    <p>SingPost said this was due to strong e-com­merce vol­ume growth across the group.</p>
    <p>But the group re­ported in­creases across most of its ex­pense cat­e­gories, which weighed on its mar­gins. In par­tic­u­lar, vol­ume-re­lated ex­penses rose by 26.7 per cent to $429.2 mil­lion, in line with higher e-com­merce vol­umes.</p>
    <p>Seg­men­tally, rev­enue from SingPost’s post and parcel seg­ment rose 5.2 per cent year on year, amid a 43 per cent rise in do­mes­tic e-com­merce vol­ume growth. The group added that ini­tia­tives such as its new tracked let­ter­box prod­uct were well re­ceived by cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Vol­umes of let­ters and printed pa­pers con­tin­ued to de­cline due to elec­tronic sub­sti­tu­tion. The group also faced higher costs with ad­di­tional health and safety ar­range­ments for Covid-19, such as hous­ing ar­range­ments for its Malaysian em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue from the lo­gis­tics seg­ment also rose 20.3 per cent on</p>
    <p>the back of in­creased e-com­merce ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>SingPost said the cross-bor­der e-com­merce vol­umes of its in­ter­na­tional post and parcel busi­ness re­mained “largely re­silient” de­spite a 96 per cent re­duc­tion in pas­sen­ger fleet due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The seg­ment’s mar­gins, how­ever, were eroded by higher costs due to long de­lays and lim­ited cargo space.</p>
    <p>The prop­erty seg­ment’s rev­enue fell 7.8 per cent to $55.5 mil­lion in the pe­riod, due pri­mar­ily to rental re­bates pro­vided for el­i­gi­ble ten­ants that amounted to about $3.2 mil­lion, as well as lower re­ceipts from carpark and atrium sales.</p>
    <p>Due to the un­cer­tain out­look, the group has de­clared an in­terim div­i­dend of 0.5 cent per or­di­nary share, half that of the div­i­dend of one cent in the pe­riod last year. The div­i­dend is ex­pected to be paid out on Dec 2.</p>
    <p>SingPost chief ex­ec­u­tive Paul Coutts said: “De­spite the strong de</p>
    <p>mand for our lo­gis­tics and de­liv­ery ser­vices, mar­gins for some of our busi­ness seg­ments have been eroded through higher costs as­so­ci­ated with Covid-19, and we ex­pect this to be the case for as long as the global pan­demic con­tin­ues.</p>
    <p>“While we re­main op­ti­mistic in the strate­gies taken to re­po­si­tion our­selves for the new nor­mal, Covid-19 con­tin­ues to pose sig­nif­i­cant chal­lenges to the op­er­at­ing en­vi­ron­ment for busi­nesses.”</p>
    <p>Look­ing ahead, SingPost said its earn­ings and op­er­at­ing cash flows will con­tinue to face head­winds from dis­rup­tions to busi­nesses. The ex­tent and du­ra­tion of these head­winds will de­pend on when the pan­demic eases, the group warned.</p>
    <p>It added that it is care­fully man­ag­ing its ex­penses, cash flows and liq­uid­ity, and will con­tinue to seek out op­por­tu­ni­ties to strengthen its com­pet­i­tive­ness and ca­pa­bil­i­ties in its key mar­kets.</p>
