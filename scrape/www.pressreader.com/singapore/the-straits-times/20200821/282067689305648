    <p>Pop­u­lar home-grown YouTube chan­nel Night Owl Cine­mat­ics (NOC) has put its work with Dee Kosh “on hold in­def­i­nitely” in the wake of sex­ual ha­rass­ment al­le­ga­tions against the dee­jay and YouTu­ber.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment re­leased on Wed­nes­day, NOC – which has a mil­lion sub­scribers – said it had re­ceived a re­quest from Dee Kosh’s man­age­ment “for him to be re­leased of any pro­fes­sional ser­vice en­gage­ment with us”.</p>
    <p>NOC said: “We can con­firm that he has no out­stand­ing or on­go­ing projects with NOC at present. All fur­ther col­lab­o­ra­tions with Dee Kosh have been put on hold in­def­i­nitely.”</p>
    <p>The 32-year-old, whose real name is Dar­ryl Ian Koshy, has been ac­cused of so­lic­it­ing nude pic­tures and of­fer­ing money to mi­nors in re­turn for sex­ual favours, among other things. Sev­eral po­lice reports have been filed and po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>Koshy’s work with the chan­nel mostly cen­tred on food re­views in its Food King se­ries, with the last be­ing a Na­tional Day video re­leased on Aug 9.</p>
    <p>Koshy has also been re­moved from NOC’s About Us page, where he was pre­vi­ously listed as a part­ner/ac­tor/host. NOC said he had been en­gaged on a free­lance ba­sis for its Food King pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>It added that it had ini­ti­ated a com­pany-wide in­ves­ti­ga­tion in­volv­ing 37 crew and 24 tal­ents, and con­cluded that Dee Kosh had not made sex­ual ad­vances to­wards any of its staff mem­bers.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Koshy posted an apol­ogy on In­sta­gram, say­ing: “I now ad­mit that there is truth to some of the things which are be­ing said now, and I am sorry to the peo­ple I have hurt in the process.”</p>
    <p>In this, he back­tracked on an ear­lier state­ment deny­ing he had had sex­ual re­la­tions with a mi­nor, and say­ing he would take “nec­es­sary steps to clear this all up”.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, two tal­ents un­der Koshy’s man­age­ment – who also ap­peared on his YouTube chan­nel of 380,000 fol­low­ers – re­leased state­ments to ad­dress the back­lash against them and clar­ify their deal­ings with Koshy were pro­fes­sional.</p>
    <p>YouTu­ber Ben Tang, who counts Koshy as “friend, men­tor and man­ager”, wrote on In­sta­gram on Wed­nes­day he was dis­ap­pointed and did not con­done his ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Tang said he has also been on the re­ceiv­ing end of abu­sive com­ments, di­rect mes­sages and in­sults aimed at his fam­ily and per­sonal life. “Now I un­der­stand that most of you are an­gry and frus­trated...but there is no need to be un­rea­son­able and tar­get your hate at the rest of the tal­ents and I,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>Pho­tos have also been cir­cu­lat­ing of Tang and Koshy dressed as a fe­male char­ac­ter called Xiaotina, in “var­i­ous stages of staged in­ti­macy”. Tang clar­i­fied that the pic­tures were part of a “fic­tional nar­ra­tive in an on­go­ing plot in­volv­ing Xiaotina” and were staged, pho­to­shopped and “not forced upon him”.</p>
    <p>He also de­nied hav­ing had a sex­ual re­la­tion­ship with Koshy. “Ev­ery­thing has been strictly pro­fes­sional since we started work­ing to­gether five years ago,” he said.</p>
    <p>An­other tal­ent un­der Koshy’s man­age­ment, Hamza Zaidi, also re­leased a state­ment on Wed­nes­day say­ing he had never re­ceived any sex­ual ad­vances from Koshy.</p>
    <p>“All of the boys and I were ap­proached by Dee Kosh on In­sta­gram and after get­ting to know us, he would sign us if he felt we were a good fit for the chan­nel. Ev­ery­thing work-re­lated was ex­tremely pro­fes­sional,” said Hamza.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral firms that Dee Kosh pre­vi­ously worked with, in­clud­ing Huawei, Food­panda and Len­ovo, said their en­gage­ments with him had ended and there were no on­go­ing or fu­ture projects planned. Power 98 FM, where he hosts week­day night shows, said on Mon­day that he is on leave and that the sta­tion “does not tol­er­ate any form of ha­rass­ment”.</p>
