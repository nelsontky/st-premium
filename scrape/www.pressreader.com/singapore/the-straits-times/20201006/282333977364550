    <p>JACK­SON (Mis­sis­sippi) All week the fo­cus was on his eyes.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery time Ser­gio Gar­cia stroked a putt, the cam­eras showed a bat­tlescarred 40-year-old who had missed so many over his ca­reer he had seen enough. Per­haps, he rea­soned, the see­ing it­self was the prob­lem. He let his lids fall, trusted the stroke, and when the last putt fell at the San­der­son Farms Cham­pi­onship, a kick-in birdie on the par­four 18th to beat Peter Mal­nati (63) by one, those eyes filled with tears.</p>
    <p>It was his first vic­tory on Tour since the 2017 Masters, and the first since he be­came a father, first to two-year-old Aza­lea and then to six-month-old Enzo.</p>
    <p>More than his putting woes, or his ti­tle drought, he thought of fam­ily.</p>
    <p>He es­pe­cially thought of the two un­cles he lost to the on­go­ing coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“My father has a lot of fam­ily in Madrid,” Gar­cia said af­ter a five-un­der 67 brought him to a 19-un­der to­tal of 269. “He’s one of nine sib­lings, and un­for­tu­nately, we lost two of his broth­ers be­cause of Covid, one at the be­gin­ning, Un­cle Paco, and one just last Satur­day... Un­cle An­gel. You know, it’s sad.</p>
    <p>“And I know that a lot of fam­i­lies have lost a lot more peo­ple, but you never want to lose any­one like that, and I wanted to win this for them.”</p>
    <p>An 11th Tour ti­tle did not look on the cards. He missed three of his pre­vi­ous four cuts on Tour, had fallen out of the world top 50, and was com­ing off a sea­son in which he recorded just one top-25 fin­ish.</p>
    <p>He had never recorded fewer than four top-25s in 21 pre­vi­ous Tour sea­sons, and missed the play­offs for just the sec­ond time in the FedExCup era.</p>
    <p>Two shots stood out on Sun­day: His five-wood sec­ond shot that trun­dled up to within four feet of the par-five 14th hole for ea­gle, and his eight-iron ap­proach on the 18th, which set up a 30-inch birdie.</p>
    <p>The ball-strik­ing that has defined his ca­reer took cen­tre stage at the Coun­try Club of Jack­son, as Gar­cia was first in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee, Strokes Gained: Tee to Green, and driv­ing dis­tance.</p>
    <p>Al­though he was only 28th in Strokes Gained: Putting, he was in pos­i­tive num­bers all four days.</p>
    <p>His un­usual putting, which he said he has been do­ing on and off for over three years, fi­nally paid off.</p>
    <p>“I was be­liev­ing in my­self the whole week,” said the Spa­niard, up to fourth in the FedExCup just three events into the new sea­son.</p>
    <p>His ex­pe­ri­ence tun­ing out the doubters served him well and with an­other Masters only a month away, he may be com­ing into form.</p>
    <p>“Well, it’s ob­vi­ously a boost of con­fi­dence,” he said. “To be able to do a lot of the things that I did... it showed me a lot of what I still have, and what I still can do.”</p>
