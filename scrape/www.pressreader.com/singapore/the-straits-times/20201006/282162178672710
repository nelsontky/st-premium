    <p>For Mr Louis Ng (Nee Soon GRC), find­ing a pub­lic toi­let with clean seats that his young daugh­ters can use is al­ways a “mad, crazy race”.</p>
    <p>“The re­al­ity is that many of our pub­lic toi­lets stink. And I’m not just talk­ing about the smell. Of­ten, seats are cov­ered in urine and the en­tire fa­cil­ity is un­hy­gienic,” he said yes­ter­day dur­ing the de­bate on the En­vi­ron­men­tal Pub­lic Health (Amend­ment) Bill.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng, who chairs the Gov­ern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee (GPC) on Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment, also high­lighted the need to “go up­stream” to im­prove pub­lic hy­giene.</p>
    <p>“While this Bill will help, we urge all Sin­ga­pore­ans to move away from the mind­set that clean­ers will be there to clean up af­ter us,” he said.</p>
    <p>Most of the other 11 MPs who spoke dur­ing the de­bate echoed the call for Sin­ga­pore­ans to step up their civic con­scious­ness to im­prove hy­giene stan­dards here.</p>
    <p>Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang GRC) said: “What does it say about us as a peo­ple when we leave our food dishes and rub­bish strewn all over the ta­ble af­ter a meal and jus­tify it by not want­ing the poor clean­ers to lose their jobs?”</p>
    <p>The Work­ers’ Party (WP) MP added that Sin­ga­pore has much to learn from so­ci­eties such as Switzer­land, Ja­pan and Tai­wan, which main­tain high lev­els of clean­li­ness de­spite not hav­ing many lit­ter bins or em­ploy­ing many clean­ers.</p>
    <p>Ms He said this is a re­sult of the civic-minded cul­ture of those so­ci­eties, where peo­ple who are sick au­to­mat­i­cally wear masks and res­i­dents sort their rub­bish into dif­fer­ent cat­e­gories for re­cy­cling, rather than wait­ing for clean­ers to do it for them.</p>
    <p>The MPs also gave sug­ges­tions to im­prove clean­li­ness and hy­giene stan­dards.</p>
    <p>WP’s Raeesah Khan (Sengkang GRC) said young peo­ple should be ex­posed to more com­mu­nity-based pro­grammes and made re­spon­si­ble for the clean­li­ness of their schools.</p>
    <p>Ms Joan Pereira (Tan­jong Pa­gar GRC) pro­posed that the Min­istry for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment spec­ify toi­let de­sign re­quire­ments to en­sure that toi­lets are eas­ier to main­tain and keep dry.</p>
    <p>Ms Poh Li San (Sem­bawang GRC) sug­gested that the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) con­sider an an­nual con­test where mem­bers of the pub­lic vote for the top three venues with the clean­est toi­lets, as well as the three venues with the dirt­i­est toi­lets.</p>
    <p>“Such a con­test may put some so­cial pres­sure to keep premise own­ers mo­ti­vated and this could pos­si­bly be more ef­fec­tive than sum­mons and fines by NEA,” she said.</p>
