    <p>Sum­mer may be over but the fi­nan­cial world is siz­zling with a his­toric de­but on Thurs­day of ground­break­ing pro­por­tions.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese home­grown fin­tech gi­ant Ant Group may not be set for list­ing in the Lon­don or New York stock ex­changes, but it is about to break all ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO) records with its launch in Hong Kong and Shang­hai.</p>
    <p>On Fri­day, re­tail in­vestors in the two cities snapped up at least US$3 tril­lion (S$4.1 tril­lion) worth of the group’s shares, enough money to buy JPMor­gan Chase 10 times over.</p>
    <p>Bid­ding in Hong Kong was so in­tense that one bro­ker­age’s plat­form re­port­edly briefly shut down af­ter be­com­ing over­whelmed by or­ders, while de­mand for the re­tail por­tion in Shang­hai ex­ceeded ini­tial sup­ply by more than 870 times.</p>
    <p>The closely watched event will strengthen Hong Kong’s po­si­tion as Asia’s IPO hub and in­ject much vi­brancy into the Hang Seng In­dex, which has lost some ground since the start of the year, ow­ing to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and the mar­ket up­heavals it has caused.</p>
    <p>Ant Group, a fi­nan­cial ser­vices com­po­nent carved out of multi-bil­lion­aire Jack Ma’s Alibaba em­pire, is set to break global records by rais­ing about US$34.4 bil­lion in the world’s big­gest IPO, sur­pass­ing the US$25 bil­lion raised in 2014 by its for­mer par­ent Alibaba Group Hold­ing and the US$29.4 bil­lion raised by Saudi Aramco last De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>This dual list­ing will turn Ant into one of the most valu­able tech com­pa­nies in the world. It will also make it a poster boy for Chi­nese fin­tech firms hop­ing to fol­low in its foot­steps.</p>
    <p>“Hong Kong’s edge in mas­sive list­ings will likely be strength­ened, not re­duced, by the in­creas­ing num­ber of Chi­nese tech IPOs in re­cent years,” said IG an­a­lyst Mar­garet Yang.</p>
    <p>Since ten­sions be­tween the United States and China ratch­eted up in 2018, the Hong Kong stock mar­ket has wel­comed prom­i­nent Chi­nese tech firms Alibaba, JD.com, Xiaomi and Meituan.</p>
    <p>“This trend may con­tinue as Bei­jing tries to pro­mote an ‘in­ter­nal cir­cu­la­tion’ strat­egy to shed re­liance on US trade, tech­nol­ogy and even the fi­nan­cial mar­ket,” said Ms Yang, who added that th­ese ad­di­tions have helped cush­ion the bench­mark in­dex from ex­ter­nal head­winds.</p>
    <p>Ant is look­ing to raise about US$17.2 bil­lion in Shang­hai and the same in Hong Kong, with share prices set at 68.8 yuan and HK$80 re­spec­tively. The Hangzhou-based group’s val­u­a­tion is es­ti­mated to hit about US$313 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Mr Ma, who re­tired from Alibaba last year and con­trols Ant with more than 50 per cent of its vot­ing rights, said in late Oc­to­ber at a fi­nan­cial fo­rum in Shang­hai that this is the first time such a big IPO was priced out­side of New York.</p>
    <p>This is some­thing “we wouldn’t have dared to think about five, or even three years ago”, he said then.</p>
    <p>Mar­ket watch­ers say the over­whelm­ing de­mand for Ant shares from in­vestors both do­mes­tic and over­seas lends con­fi­dence to other pri­vate uni­corns.</p>
    <p>And the repa­tri­a­tion of Chi­ne­selisted cor­po­ra­tions – trig­gered first by Bei­jing’s de­sire to ex­ert greater con­trol over China’s over­seas firms and their of­ten wealthy founders and later driven by de­te­ri­o­rat­ing US-China ties – has pro­vided a much-needed morale boost to the Hong Kong mar­ket, said Mr Brock Sil­vers, chief in­vest­ment of­fi­cer of Kaiyuan Cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>“Should the bi­lat­eral re­la­tion­ship con­tinue to sour, es­pe­cially in a sec­ond Trump term, the trend may ex­tend from large-cap to mid­cap com­pa­nies. This would be good news for Hong Kong, es­pe­cially if that trend can out­last the eco­nomic down­turns,” he said.</p>
    <p>On the Shang­hai side of the Ant deal, in­vestors in­clude China’s na­tional pen­sion fund and fund man­agers linked to state-owned firms, lenders and in­sur­ers.</p>
    <p>For­eign in­vestors in­clude Sin­ga­pore’s GIC and Te­masek Fuller­ton Al­pha, Canada Pen­sion Plan In­vest­ment Board and the Abu Dhabi In­vest­ment Author­ity.</p>
    <p>Alibaba is set to buy 51.1 bil­lion yuan worth of shares to keep its stake at about one-third of Ant, while Mr Ma and Ant’s top man­age­ment will col­lec­tively own about 39.5 per cent of the lat­ter.</p>
    <p>Asked about the nu­ances of Shang­hai’s in­volve­ment in this be­he­moth deal, Mr Sil­vers said many Chi­nese “home­grown cham­pi­ons” opt for dual main­land or Hong</p>
    <p>Kong list­ings for var­i­ous rea­sons.</p>
    <p>Main­land list­ings please the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties as firms come un­der main­land reg­u­la­tory con­trol. Such list­ings also al­low share­holder bases to be en­larged and help com­pa­nies raise ren­minbi cap­i­tal. But many com­pa­nies also value the hard cur­rency fundrais­ing and ex­po­sure pro­vided by Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>So, for now, th­ese dual list­ings can blunt US lever­age re­sult­ing from New York’s pri­macy in global fi­nance, Mr Sil­vers said.</p>
    <p>“Hong Kong has now seem­ingly trans­ferred from be­ing a West­ern ‘win­dow into China’ into be­ing</p>
    <p>China’s ‘win­dow to the West’.”</p>
    <p>And, as Ms Yang pointed out, over­seas in­vestors may still pre­fer to trade in Hong Kong’s ex­change in­stead of Shang­hai due to its ease of ac­cess, liq­uid­ity, forex ex­change and set­tle­ment con­ve­nience.</p>
