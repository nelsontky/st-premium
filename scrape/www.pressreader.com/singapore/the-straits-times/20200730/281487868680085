    <p>Bank ac­count hold­ers can now scan their faces on their phones to ap­ply for an on­line bank­ing ac­count, with the launch yes­ter­day of a na­tional fa­cial iden­ti­fi­ca­tion ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Called SingPass Face Ver­i­fi­ca­tion, the ser­vice matches cap­tured fa­cial im­ages against the Gov­ern­ment’s bio­met­ric data­base. This na­tional data­base con­tains the fa­cial im­ages and iden­ti­ties of four mil­lion lo­cal res­i­dents aged 15 years and above, cap­tured through ap­pli­ca­tions for pass­ports and NRICs.</p>
    <p>Its use has so far been lim­ited to of­fi­cial pur­poses, in­clud­ing ver­i­fi­ca­tion at border check­points and in some gov­ern­ment build­ings to limit ac­cess rights.</p>
    <p>With SingPass Face Ver­i­fi­ca­tion, pri­vate-sec­tor or­gan­i­sa­tions can now tap the na­tion’s dig­i­tal iden­tity in­fra­struc­ture to se­curely ver­ify on­line trans­ac­tions with­out need­ing to build their own sys­tems.</p>
    <p>DBS Bank is the first pri­vate-sec­tor en­tity to pi­lot the ser­vice, which is in­te­grated into its di­gibank app.</p>
    <p>For a start, its cus­tomers can choose to scan their faces – in­stead of en­ter­ing their ATM, credit or debit card num­ber and a cor­re­spond­ing PIN – to sign up for an on­line bank­ing ac­count. Users need to down­load the lat­est ver­sion of the bank’s di­gibank app, rolled out yes­ter­day, to ac­cess the new fea­ture.</p>
    <p>In the com­ing months, new cus­tomers may also be able to scan their faces re­motely to ver­ify who they are with­out hav­ing to up­load pic­tures of their NRIC or show up in per­son to, say, open a bank ac­count.</p>
    <p>Mr Jeremy Soo, head of Con­sumer Bank­ing Group (Sin­ga­pore) at DBS, said: “To­gether with GovTech (Gov­ern­ment Tech­nol­ogy Agency), we aim to sup­port those who are jour­ney­ing into dig­i­tal bank­ing for the first time and to help foster re­silient dig­i­tal habits that will last for years to come.”</p>
    <p>The Straits Times re­ported on the gov­ern­ment-backed fa­cial iden­ti­fi­ca­tion ser­vice in­volv­ing greater use of the na­tional bio­met­ric data­base in Novem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>Dr Vi­vian Balakrishn­an, Min­is­terin-charge of the Smart Na­tion ini­tia­tive, an­nounced the ser­vice in Par­lia­ment in Fe­bru­ary this year.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple here are al­ready scan­ning their faces or fin­ger­prints on their phones to ac­cess e-gov­ern­ment ser­vices via the SingPass Mo­bile app, which was launched in 2018 and now has 1.6 mil­lion users.</p>
    <p>Pri­vate-sec­tor firms like in­surer NTUC In­come are also us­ing the SingPass Mo­bile app to se­cure ac­cess to their e-ser­vices.</p>
    <p>SingPass Face Ver­i­fi­ca­tion takes the mo­bile ser­vice for­ward by match­ing cap­tured fa­cial im­ages against the bio­met­ric data­base.</p>
    <p>This step makes it eas­ier to ver­ify high-risk on­line trans­ac­tions, in­clud­ing those in­volv­ing cashier’s or­ders of more than $10,000, said ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Kok Ping Soon, chief ex­ec­u­tive of GovTech, which cre­ated the SingPass au­then­ti­ca­tion sys­tem: “We look for­ward to build­ing more im­pact­ful ser­vices with the fi­nan­cial sec­tor and be­yond to bring greater con­ve­nience to our cit­i­zens.”</p>
    <p>SingPass Face Ver­i­fi­ca­tion’s launch, with DBS as its first user, fol­lows a suc­cess­ful trial ear­lier this month with more than 100 se­niors and stu­dents from ITE Col­lege West.</p>
    <p>Some users found fa­cial ver­i­fi­ca­tion to be more con­ve­nient as they do not need to re­mem­ber their PIN num­ber or whip out their ATM, credit or debit card to com­plete the reg­is­tra­tion process.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, those with­out a card or who could not re­mem­ber their PIN num­ber had to wait up to five work­ing days to re­ceive their card or PIN num­ber by post to ac­ti­vate their dig­i­tal bank­ing ac­counts.</p>
    <p>Said re­tiree Nancy Yeo, 66: “Reg­is­ter­ing for an on­line bank­ing ac­count by fa­cial scan­ning was just like tak­ing a selfie photo with my grand­child on my smart­phone... it re­ally isn’t as com­pli­cated as I had thought.”</p>
