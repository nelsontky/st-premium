    <p>South Korean Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in has ap­pointed Mr Park Jie-won as di­rec­tor of the Na­tional In­tel­li­gence Ser­vice and Mr Lee In-young as the Uni­fi­ca­tion Min­is­ter. The move seeks to ce­ment progress with North Korea as a ma­jor legacy in Mr Moon’s fi­nal two years in of­fice. WORLD</p>
    <p>SEOUL • South Korean Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in’s new point men on North Korea face a daunt­ing chal­lenge: They must en­gi­neer a break­through in strained ties amid pub­lic scru­tiny of their his­tory with Py­ongyang, which once l anded them in pri­son.</p>
    <p>Mr Moon this week ap­pointed Mr Park Jie-won as di­rec­tor of the Na­tional In­tel­li­gence Agency (NIS) and Mr Lee In-young as uni­fi­ca­tion min­is­ter, seek­ing to ce­ment progress with North Korea as a ma­jor legacy in his fi­nal two years in of­fice.</p>
    <p>The two men, both l ong-time law­mak­ers, are key ad­vo­cates of Mr Moon’s drive for in­ter-Korea rap­proche­ment, but their po­lit­i­cal pasts rekin­dled the con­tro­ver­sies and de­bates that have shaped Seoul’s re­la­tions with Py­ongyang.</p>
    <p>Both of them have a dra­matic his­tory with North Korea. A for­mer busi­ness­man, Mr Park was sen­tenced to three years in pri­son for help­ing the late South Korean pres­i­dent Kim Dae-jung ar­range for Hyundai, which was op­er­at­ing North Korea busi­nesses, to send US$450 mil­lion (S$619 mil­lion) to Py­ongyang.</p>
    <p>Hyundai said the money was for busi­ness rights, but the court ruled that the pay­ment was to fa­cil­i­tate the in­ter-Korea sum­mit in 2000 with then North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, and had come through the NIS.</p>
    <p>Mr Park served about eight months in pri­son be­fore he was par­doned. The 78-year-old said at his con­fir­ma­tion hear­ing on Mon­day that the pay­ment was “in­ap­pro­pri­ate” and that he com­plied with the court rul­ing, but the ver­dict was wrong as the money was wired by Hyundai with­out his knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers said Mr Park’s ap­point­ment could send the wrong mes­sage to Py­ongyang and Wash­ing­ton. Mr Moon is try­ing to restart in­ter-Korea eco­nomic projects even as nu­clear ne­go­ti­a­tions have stag­nated.</p>
    <p>The NIS could play a cat­alytic role in be­hind-the-scenes ne­go­ti­a­tions with the North, but the agency’s opaque struc­ture has trig­gered calls for an over­haul. Many for­mer di­rec­tors and se­nior of­fi­cials have been im­pris­oned for po­lit­i­cal med­dling.</p>
    <p>“I don’t be­lieve the gov­ern­ment would seek il­licit fi­nan­cial trans­ac­tions for an­other sum­mit, but there would be greater temp­ta­tions to re­sort to an ab­nor­mal ap­proach in find­ing a break­through with North Korea,” said Mr Cho Tae-yong, an op­po­si­tion law­maker who was for­merly a deputy na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser and nu­clear ne­go­tia­tor.</p>
    <p>Mr Park vowed to trans­par­ently carry out pol­icy and steer clear of il­le­gal ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>“I would help bring a break­through in in­ter-Korea re­la­tions and re­spond with re­form that cleans up the dark side of the NIS’ his­tory,” he told Mr Moon dur­ing an ap­point­ment cer­e­mony yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee, 56, was a prom­i­nent democ­racy cam­paigner who led a stu­dent ac­tivist group in the 1980s seen by some as rever­ing North Korea’s found­ing fa­ther Kim Il Sung and his “juche”, or self-re­liance, ide­ol­ogy.</p>
    <p>He was sen­tenced to 11/2 years in pri­son in 1988 on charges of pos­sess­ing North Korean pro­pa­ganda ma­te­ri­als and host­ing protests that might cause “so­cial un­rest”, but was par­doned six months later.</p>
    <p>“When I was young, our pri­mary cause was to ac­com­plish uni­fi­ca­tion, be­cause dic­ta­tors ex­ploited the na­tional divi­sion to per­se­cute us democ­racy ac­tivists,” Mr Lee told Reuters in 2018. “Some peo­ple called us North fol­low­ers but that’s not true, though we might have a warmer heart than oth­ers to­wards the North and greater pa­tience to achieve peace.”</p>
