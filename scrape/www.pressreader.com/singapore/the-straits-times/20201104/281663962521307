    <p>Dis­tressed mi­cro and small com­pa­nies will be able to re­struc­ture their debts quickly to deal with the eco­nomic im­pact from the pan­demic, with help from a new scheme.</p>
    <p>The Sim­pli­fied In­sol­vency Pro­gramme (SIP), which also in­cludes pro­cesses to help com­pa­nies which are no longer vi­able to wind up ef­fi­ciently while max­imis­ing re­turns to cred­i­tors and com­pany stake­hold­ers, was in­tro­duced as part of changes to the In­sol­vency, Re­struc­tur­ing and Dis­so­lu­tion Act yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Pre­sent­ing the Bill for de­bate in Par­lia­ment, Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Law Ed­win Tong said the pro­posed amend­ments pro­vide tem­po­rary pro­cesses that ben­e­fit com­pany stake­hold­ers such as em­ploy­ees, cred­i­tors and share­hold­ers by re­duc­ing the time needed for both re­struc­tur­ing and liq­ui­da­tion.</p>
    <p>The pro­grammes un­der the SIP will bet­ter suit the needs of mi­cro and small com­pa­nies, which may find it fi­nan­cially chal­leng­ing to ap­ply the cur­rent Act’s pro­vi­sions, he added.</p>
    <p>Mi­cro and small com­pa­nies are de­fined as hav­ing an­nual rev­enue of less than $1 mil­lion and $10 mil­lion re­spec­tively, and they ac­count for about 95 per cent of en­ter­prises in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong high­lighted that a suc­cess­ful re­struc­tur­ing will al­low a com­pany to con­tinue op­er­at­ing, thereby sav­ing jobs, and re­sult in bet­ter out­comes for em­ploy­ees, cred­i­tors and in­vestors as a whole.</p>
    <p>An ef­fec­tive liq­ui­da­tion process also en­ables the re­al­lo­ca­tion of re­sources to more pro­duc­tive busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties, and max­imises the re­turns to com­pany stake­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, civil engi­neer­ing con­tract­ing firm Swee Hong was granted an or­der by the High Court to give su­per-pri­or­ity sta­tus to over US$2 mil­lion (S$2.7 mil­lion) of res­cue fi­nanc­ing in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>This al­lowed the com­pany to con­tinue op­er­at­ing while at­tempt­ing to re­struc­ture, with its pro­posed scheme of ar­range­ment ap­proved around seven months later.</p>
    <p>“If sanc­tioned by the court, the re­struc­tur­ing would al­low Swee Hong, which was in­sol­vent, to con­tinue as a go­ing con­cern and avert a wind­ing-up.</p>
    <p>“This in turn helps to save the busi­ness (and) keeps jobs, not only for Swee Hong but also for many of its coun­ter­par­ties and sub­con­trac­tors,” Mr Tong said.</p>
    <p>But while the cur­rent Act has fa­cil­i­tated pos­i­tive re­sults such as for Swee Hong, Mr Tong said it was not de­signed with the ef­fects of a global pan­demic in mind.</p>
    <p>The SIP seeks to fill this gap by ad­dress­ing the needs of mi­cro and small com­pa­nies, which are likely to be badly hit by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The sim­pli­fied debt re­struc­tur­ing pro­gramme in­cludes sev­eral mea­sures to help trou­bled firms save costs and time, such as al­low­ing an au­tho­rised of­fi­cer of the com­pany to rep­re­sent it in court pro­ceed­ings in­stead of hav­ing to en­gage le­gal coun­sel.</p>
    <p>A re­struc­tur­ing ad­viser will also be ap­pointed to as­sist the firm in the process.</p>
    <p>Firms will need to make only one court ap­pli­ca­tion, com­pared with at least three typ­i­cally.</p>
    <p>For non-vi­able firms look­ing to dis­solve op­er­a­tions, the sim­pli­fied wind­ing-up pro­gramme will be a more stream­lined process, com­menced through an ap­pli­ca­tion to the Of­fi­cial Re­ceiver with­out hav­ing to nom­i­nate a liq­uida­tor, which cred­i­tors may dis­agree with. Un­der the sim­pli­fied process, the Of­fi­cial Re­ceiver steps in to be the liq­uida­tor.</p>
    <p>The SIP and the Re-Align Frame­work, in­tro­duced on Mon­day, are a nec­es­sary part of the suite of mea­sures that the Gov­ern­ment is pro­vid­ing to help busi­nesses and the work­force emerge stronger from the pan­demic, Mr Tong said.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the Bill also in­tro­duced an amend­ment which will em­power the min­is­ter to al­low in­di­vid­u­als to hold an in­sol­vency prac­ti­tioner’s li­cence with­out be­ing a “qual­i­fied per­son”, such as for pro­fes­sion­als who act for com­pa­nies or cred­i­tors in cross-bor­der trans­ac­tions or re­struc­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pat­ing in the de­bate yes­ter­day, Mr Vikram Nair (Sem­bawang GRC) said that while the sim­pli­fied in­sol­vency pro­cesses may seem “rough and ready” com­pared with the cur­rent pro­cesses in court, it is a fair trade-off for lower costs and im­proved ef­fi­ciency.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that the main driver for the changes to the Act is the Covid-19 cri­sis and the need for ur­gent mea­sures to help firms sur­vive this pe­riod, he sug­gested that these amend­ments could be made a per­ma­nent fea­ture of Sin­ga­pore’s leg­is­la­tion should the sim­pli­fied pro­cesses prove ef­fec­tive.</p>
