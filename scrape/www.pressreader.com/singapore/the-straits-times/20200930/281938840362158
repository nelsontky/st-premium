    <p>The South China Sea is not the only wa­ter­way in South-east Asia over which the United States and China are en­gaged in a con­test for in­flu­ence. Less high pro­file but of great sig­nif­i­cance too to the re­gion is the power play over the Mekong River.</p>
    <p>The Mekong be­gins in the icy Ti­betan high­lands and runs for over 4,000km through China,</p>
    <p>Myan­mar, Thai­land, Laos, Cam­bo­dia and Viet­nam be­fore emp­ty­ing into the South China Sea. Its river basin is home to the largest in­land fishery in the world and more than 60 mil­lion peo­ple de­pend on it for their liveli­hood.</p>
    <p>In re­cent weeks, two meet­ings took place that re­flected the grow­ing importance of the Mekong re­gion to the US-China tus­sle for in­flu­ence in main­land South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>The first, held late last month, was be­tween China and the five Mekong mem­bers of Asean – Cam­bo­dia, Laos, Myan­mar, Thai­land and Viet­nam. The se­cond, held this month, was the in­au­gu­ral Mekong-US Part­ner­ship Min­is­te­rial Meet­ing be­tween the US and the same Asean coun­tries.</p>
    <p>At the third Lan­cang-Mekong Co­op­er­a­tion (LMC) Lead­ers’ Meet­ing last month, Chi­nese Premier Li Ke­qiang pledged to share water man­age­ment data from its por­tion of the Mekong River – also known as Lan­cang River – for the whole year with the rest of the Mekong coun­tries. The data from China is meant to help down­stream coun­tries make plans and re­quest ad­just­ments in the river’s flow based on their needs.</p>
    <p>This was a wel­come change for the down­stream Asean coun­tries, par­tic­u­larly after a se­vere drought last year re­duced water lev­els in the Mekong to their low­est level in over 100 years.</p>
    <p>While the prob­lem was partly at­trib­uted to the ef­fects of ex­treme weather, ex­perts also pointed to China’s 11 hy­dro-dams in the up­per stretches of the Mekong as hav­ing played a role in ag­gra­vat­ing the water cri­sis in the past two years.</p>
    <p>In the past, China shared its Mekong water data only dur­ing the wet sea­son from June to Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing’s shift in its po­si­tion re­flected greater sen­si­tiv­ity to the needs of its Mekong coun­ter­parts, with Premier Li say­ing that China will re­spect the “le­git­i­mate rights and in­ter­ests of Lan­cang-Mekong coun­tries to ra­tio­nally de­velop and utilise water re­sources”. The change in tone came on the heels of heavy crit­i­cism by US of­fi­cials and a damn­ing re­port on China’s ma­nip­u­la­tion of the Mekong River by US-based re­search com­pany Eyes on Earth.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, at the Mekong-US Part­ner­ship Min­is­te­rial Meet­ing on Sept 11, US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo launched the Mekong-US Part­ner­ship and pledged to pro­vide at least US$153 mil­lion (S$209 mil­lion) for joint projects.</p>
    <p>The Part­ner­ship ex­pands on co­op­er­a­tion be­gun in 2009 un­der the Lower Mekong Ini­tia­tive, which is aimed at strength­en­ing the au­ton­omy, eco­nomic in­de­pen­dence and sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment of the Mekong part­ner coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Amer­ica’s re­newed com­mit­ment and fresh fund­ing to the Mekong sub-re­gion has been wel­comed by the Asean Mekong coun­tries but whether that trans­lates into vi­able al­ter­na­tives for them as they re­cal­i­brate their po­si­tions vis a vis China re­mains to be seen.</p>
    <p>The Mekong sub-re­gion is clearly and rapidly turn­ing into a new bat­tle­ground for US-China ri­valry. This year saw a string of barbs ex­changed be­tween the US and China. Se­nior US diplo­mat</p>
    <p>David Stil­well said in an on­line we­bi­nar that China was “ma­nip­u­lat­ing” the Mekong River “for its own profit (and) at great cost to down­stream na­tions”.</p>
    <p>China has re­jected claims that it is hold­ing back water from the mil­lions of peo­ple liv­ing down­stream who de­pend on the Mekong for their food and in­come.</p>
    <p>MORE THAN AN EN­VI­RON­MEN­TAL IS­SUE</p>
    <p>Yet com­pared to Asean’s trou­bles in the South China Sea, the Mekong is­sues have not at­tained a “re­gional” sta­tus that al­low for them to be dis­cussed among all Asean mem­ber states.</p>
    <p>As the Asean chair for 2020, Viet­nam has tried to put the Mekong is­sues on the re­gional agenda but the coro­n­avirus pan­demic cri­sis has shifted the re­gion’s at­ten­tion to fo­cus on public health and eco­nomic re­cov­ery, thereby nar­row­ing Viet­nam’s win­dow of op­por­tu­nity to do so this year.</p>
    <p>As Viet­nam pre­pares to hand over the chair­man­ship to Brunei for next year, there is a risk that the Mekong is­sues will con­tinue to re­main un­der the radar of Asean, as they have so far, with po­ten­tially dis­as­trous con­se­quences for the re­gion as a whole.</p>
    <p>The trou­bles over the Mekong River have been largely viewed through an en­vi­ron­men­tal and so­cio-eco­nomic lens, af­fect­ing only the main­land coun­tries of Asean.</p>
    <p>Its link­ages with the re­gion’s broader se­cu­rity and geopo­lit­i­cal con­sid­er­a­tions have been given less at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>In the last two decades, there has been a rush of hy­dro-dam con­struc­tion on the river, with the hope of gen­er­at­ing re­new­able en­ergy for the re­gion. China has built 11 dams on the Lan­cang River, with another 11 main­stream dams in the lower Mekong and 120 dams in the trib­u­taries in the pipe­line. The im­pact on fish­eries and rice crops in the down­stream coun­tries has been dev­as­tat­ing and is well doc­u­mented.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing last year’s drought cri­sis, ex­perts have also sounded the alarm on the even­tual col­lapse of the ecosys­tem in the Mekong basin.</p>
    <p>Sadly, the costs of the damming of the Mekong have been largely borne by lo­cal com­mu­ni­ties. The loss of liveli­hoods and in­creased food in­se­cu­rity have driven many to mi­grate as a re­sult.</p>
    <p>Forced dis­place­ment brings with it other hu­man se­cu­rity prob­lems such as hu­man traf­fick­ing, drug traf­fick­ing and other forms of or­gan­ised crime, which un­der­mines re­gional sta­bil­ity and eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>A re­cent as­sess­ment by the</p>
    <p>Asean In­sti­tutes of Strate­gic and In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies network of think-tanks high­lights the risk of loom­ing dual crises as the in­ter­con­nect­ed­ness of se­cu­rity threats in­creases (for ex­am­ple, pan­demic-hunger, pan­demic-nat­u­ral disas­ters, pan­demic-hu­man­i­tar­ian crises). The cur­rent sit­u­a­tion in the Mekong basin may well be the back­ground for the un­fold­ing of th­ese crises.</p>
    <p>There are geopo­lit­i­cal con­sid­er­a­tions too. A re­port by Fitch So­lu­tions says that heavy losses in fish­ing and farm­ing – long re­garded as pri­mary sub­sis­tence for many lo­cal com­mu­ni­ties – as a re­sult of dam build­ing will force Asean coun­tries to rely on in­creased food im­ports from China.</p>
    <p>CHINA’S WATER SU­PER­HIGH­WAY PRO­JECT</p>
    <p>At the same time, China’s plans to cre­ate a water su­per­high­way for com­mer­cial cargo through the Mekong “rapids blast­ing” pro­ject has been con­tro­ver­sial. The pro­ject calls for the re­moval of rapids from stretches of the Mekong River through dredg­ing and blast­ing, en­abling com­mer­cial ship­ping to move eas­ily along the wa­ter­way.</p>
    <p>While the pro­ject has been im­ple­mented in stretches of the Mekong in China, Myan­mar and along the Lao border, it has met with strong re­sis­tance from Thai Mekong com­mu­ni­ties and en­vi­ron­men­tal groups in the last two decades, cul­mi­nat­ing in the ter­mi­na­tion of the pro­ject by the Thai Cabinet early this year.</p>
    <p>It re­mains to be seen how long Thai­land can put a pause but­ton on China’s long-term plan to deepen the Mekong River for trade.</p>
    <p>There are sig­nif­i­cant cor­po­rate and geopo­lit­i­cal in­ter­ests in trans­form­ing the Mekong River into an in­dus­trial water cor­ri­dor be­tween China and the Mekong coun­tries of Asean.</p>
    <p>On top of that, China’s mas­sive trade with and in­vest­ments into the Asean Mekong coun­tries and its pledge of US$300 mil­lion to the LMC Spe­cial Fund makes it hard for the Asean coun­tries to turn away from China.</p>
    <p>The strate­gic importance of the Mekong River to South-east Asia calls for an ur­gent and new ap­proach from Asean. Beyond Viet­nam, fu­ture chairs of Asean should sup­port the in­clu­sion of the Mekong is­sues into its re­gional agenda.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the idea of re­viv­ing the Asean troika mech­a­nism should be con­sid­ered as a way to ad­dress press­ing is­sues such as the Mekong is­sues in a timely and fo­cused man­ner. The cur­rent</p>
    <p>Asean coun­try co­or­di­na­tor of Asean-China Di­a­logue Re­la­tions – the Philip­pines – should proac­tively in­clude the Mekong is­sues in fu­ture dis­cus­sions with China.</p>
    <p>It is also in the in­ter­est of Asean to pro­mote greater co­or­di­na­tion and col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween the</p>
    <p>LMC and other in­ter­gov­ern­men­tal mech­a­nisms such as the Mekong River Com­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>More fun­da­men­tally, Asean needs to fo­cus on nar­row­ing the de­vel­op­ment gaps be­tween the more de­vel­oped economies of the grouping and coun­tries such as Cam­bo­dia, Laos and Myan­mar.</p>
    <p>This is to avoid any coun­try be­ing trapped in Bei­jing’s or­bit with reper­cus­sions on Asean’s abil­ity to act co­he­sively on key re­gional is­sues.</p>
    <p>In the words of Sin­ga­pore’s Am­bas­sador-at-Large Bi­la­hari Kausikan, Asean needs to “dis­card a nar­row trans­ac­tional ap­proach to­wards Mekong is­sues and think about South-east Asia holis­ti­cally as one strate­gic theatre”.</p>
    <p>The importance of the Mekong to South-east Asia de­mands a timely and de­ci­sive re­sponse from Asean. In the ab­sence of this, Asean’s cen­tral­ity will be fur­ther im­paired and the re­gion’s sta­bil­ity and growth in the long term will be chal­lenged.</p>
