    <p>PARIS France will start eas­ing its Covid-19 lock­down this week­end so that by Christ­mas, shops, the­atres and cin­e­mas will re­open and peo­ple will be able to spend the hol­i­day with their fam­i­lies, Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron said.</p>
    <p>In a tele­vised ad­dress to the na­tion on Tues­day, Mr Macron said the worst of the sec­ond wave of the pan­demic in France was over, but that restau­rants, cafes and bars would have to stay shut un­til Jan 20 to avoid trig­ger­ing a third wave. “We must do ev­ery­thing to avoid a third wave, do ev­ery­thing to avoid a third lock­down,” he said.</p>
    <p>Af­ter cur­fews in ma­jor French ci­ties in mid-Oc­to­ber failed to pro­duce the re­sults hoped for, the gov­ern­ment im­posed a one-month lock­down on Oct 30.</p>
    <p>Pos­i­tive trends, in­clud­ing a de­cline in Covid-19 hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions, com­bined with pres­sure from busi­ness lob­bies who say they are fac­ing fi­nan­cial ruin, have led to calls to start loos­en­ing the lock­down as soon as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Mr Macron’s gov­ern­ment is keen to stress to peo­ple they should ex­pect only a grad­ual re­open­ing of the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>On Saturday, shops will re­open but peo­ple will still need a doc­u­ment to ven­ture out. They will be al­lowed to ex­er­cise for three hours in­stead of one, and within a 20km ra­dius of their homes, ver­sus the 1km al­lowed now.</p>
    <p>In mid-De­cem­ber, the l ock­down will be lifted if the num­ber of new cases has fallen to around 5,000 a day, Mr Macron said, but a cur­few would be im­posed from 9pm.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent said peo­ple will be free to travel across the coun­try to see their loved ones dur­ing the end-of-year hol­i­day and l eave home to so­cialise on Christ­mas Eve and New Year’s Eve, de­spite the 9pm cur­few. But no public gath­er­ings will be al­lowed and ski re­sorts will not re­open be­fore Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>“The Christ­mas hol­i­days won’t be the same as be­fore, that’s for sure,” Mr Macron said.</p>
    <p>France will be ready to start a vac­ci­na­tion cam­paign at the end of next month or the be­gin­ning of Jan­uary, Mr Macron said, start­ing with the most vul­ner­a­ble and older peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine, which he called “a glim­mer of hope”, will not be manda­tory, he said.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment is tread­ing care­fully on a fu­ture vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme, aware that the French, fol­low­ing a se­ries of public health scan­dals in re­cent decades, have some of the low­est lev­els of trust in vac­cines in the world.</p>
    <p>An Ip­sos poll for the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum showed only 59 per cent of French re­spon­dents said they would get a Covid-19 vac­cine if it be­came avail­able, com­pared with 67 per cent in the United States and 85 per cent in Britain.</p>
    <p>Over in Britain, Eng­land, Scot­land, Wales and North­ern Ire­land have all agreed to re­lax Covid-19 re­stric­tions for Christ­mas to al­low up to three house­holds to meet at home for five days.</p>
    <p>Three house­holds will be able to form a “Christ­mas bubble”, al­low­ing them to meet up at home, places of wor­ship and out­door public places but not in in­door hos­pi­tal­ity or en­ter­tain­ment venues from Dec 23 to 27.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple want to be with their loved ones and those close to them for what is the most im­por­tant hol­i­day of the year,” se­nior min­is­ter Michael Gove said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Lim­its on travel will also be scrapped so that peo­ple can meet up, with an ad­di­tional day on ei­ther side for those go­ing to and from North­ern Ire­land.</p>
    <p>A na­tional lock­down in Eng­land is due to end next week af­ter which dif­fer­ent parts of the coun­try will face vary­ing re­stric­tions as part of a tiered sys­tem an­nounced by Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son.</p>
    <p>A de­ci­sion is ex­pected later this week on which ar­eas will fall into the dif­fer­ent cat­e­gories.</p>
    <p>“The virus won’t take time off, so please be cau­tious,” said Scot­land’s First Min­is­ter Ni­cola Stur­geon. “If you can, stay at home with your own house­hold.”</p>
    <p>In Germany, the coun­try re­ported a record 410 Covid-19 deaths in the last 24 hours, be­fore the 16 fed­eral state lead­ers and Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel were due to meet yes­ter­day to dis­cuss re­stric­tions for the Christ­mas and New Year hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>Sax­ony’s Pre­mier Michael Kretschmer warned of a col­lapse of med­i­cal care in the com­ing weeks.</p>
    <p>“The sit­u­a­tion in the hos­pi­tals is worrying... We can­not guar­an­tee med­i­cal care at this high level (of in­fec­tions),” he told MDR ra­dio.</p>
    <p>The fed­eral states were yes­ter­day ex­pected to de­cide to ex­tend the “lock­down light” un­til Dec 20. This will keep bars, restau­rants and en­ter­tain­ment venues shut while schools and shops stay open.</p>
    <p>They also plan to re­duce the num­ber of peo­ple al­lowed to meet to five from Dec 1, but al­low gath­er­ings of up to 10 peo­ple over Christ­mas and New Year to let fam­i­lies and friends cel­e­brate to­gether, a draft pro­posal showed on Tues­day.</p>
