    <p>•</p>
    <p>A Rus­sian his­to­rian and Napoleon en­thu­si­ast has been sen­tenced to 121/ years in</p>
    <p>2 prison for mur­der­ing and dis­mem­ber­ing his young lover last year.</p>
    <p>The St Pe­ters­burg trial, which spurred ac­tivists to voice grow­ing anger over do­mes­tic abuse in Rus­sia, be­gan in June af­ter de­lays due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Oleg Sokolov, 64, ad­mit­ted mur­der­ing 24-year-old Anas­ta­sia Yeshchenko, but said he com­mit­ted the crime against his for­mer stu­dent and lover in the heat of the mo­ment dur­ing an ar­gu­ment.</p>
    <p>He was ar­rested in Novem­ber last year, af­ter he was hauled out of the freez­ing Moika River in St Pe­ters­burg while drunk and car­ry­ing a back­pack con­tain­ing a woman’s arms.</p>
    <p>Judge Yu­lia Maxi­menko sen­tenced Sokolov on Fri­day to “12 years and six months in a strict regime pe­nal colony” on charges of murder and the il­le­gal pos­ses­sion of firearms.</p>
    <p>“He was aware of his ac­tions at the time of the crime,” the judge said, adding that the in­tent to murder arose “sud­denly”.</p>
    <p>Sokolov, a his­to­rian who re­ceived France’s Le­gion d’Hon­neur in 2003, paced back and forth as the sen­tence was read.</p>
    <p>His lawyer Sergei Lukyanov said the de­fence “does not agree” with the sen­tence but will de­cide whether to ap­peal af­ter re­ceiv­ing a copy of the ver­dict.</p>
    <p>The court heard the fi­nal ar­gu­ments in the case this month, and pros­e­cu­tors sought a 15-year-term.</p>
    <p>Ms Yeshchenko’s par­ents at­tended the sen­tenc­ing on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Their lawyer Alexan­dra Bak­sheyeva told re­porters that even though “noth­ing can bring their daugh­ter back”, the fam­ily does not in­tend to ap­peal against the ver­dict and to re­quest a harsher sen­tence.</p>
    <p>Sokolov taught his­tory at St Pe­ters­burg State Univer­sity, Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin’s alma mater, and was close to the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The dec­o­rated his­to­rian au­thored sev­eral books on Napoleon Bon­a­parte and of­ten led his­tor­i­cal reen­act­ments of the French em­peror’s 1812 Rus­sian cam­paign.</p>
    <p>The grue­some murder shocked Rus­sia, while many of his stu­dents said Sokolov had ex­hib­ited in­ap­pro­pri­ate be­hav­iour in the past and de­manded that man­age­ment at the univer­sity be in­ves­ti­gated.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery year, nearly 16.5 mil­lion women across Rus­sia fall vic­tim to do­mes­tic vi­o­lence, ac­cord­ing to rights ac­tivists.</p>
    <p>How­ever, ef­forts to lobby for a spe­cialised law against vi­o­lence and pro­tect vic­tims have failed.</p>
