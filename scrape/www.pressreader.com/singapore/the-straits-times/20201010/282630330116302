    <p>Patis­serie-cafe chain Bakerzin is clos­ing all five of its out­lets here af­ter 22 years, ac­cord­ing to a report in fi­nan­cial daily Business Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It said Bakerzin Hold­ings had on Mon­day given no­tice of a cred­i­tors’ meet­ing for the pur­pose of wind­ing up. One of the items on the agenda is to con­firm the ap­point­ment of the liq­uida­tor.</p>
    <p>The eatery, which had been op­er­at­ing for more than two decades to date, had out­lets in Maju Av­enue, Raf­fles Hos­pi­tal, Gar­dens by the Bay, United Square and Wisma Atria.</p>
    <p>Its web­site has been taken down and the com­pany could not be reached for com­ment.</p>
    <p>It was still sell­ing moon­cakes last month for the Mid-Au­tumn Fes­ti­val and its last Face­book post on Sept 30 was to pro­mote the fes­tive pas­tries.</p>
    <p>Bakerzin was founded by pas­try chef Daniel Tay in 1998 as Baker’s Inn in Sem­bawang and was re­named in 2004.</p>
    <p>He sold the business in 2007, but con­tin­ued to run it as chief ex­ec­u­tive un­til 2013.</p>
    <p>He now op­er­ates Cat & The Fid­dle, a cheese­cake business, and tra­di­tional pas­try brand Old Seng Choong un­der his own com­pany Foodg­nos­tic.</p>
    <p>Tay, 49, said he got wind of the com­pany’s im­pend­ing clo­sure about three months ago from his for­mer staff at the com­pany, but was told that it had wanted to ful­fil its moon­cake or­ders first.</p>
    <p>“They were re­trench­ing many of the staff too,” he said, adding that some of them have since joined him.</p>
    <p>On the clo­sure of the brand he cre­ated, he said: “I feel very sad. If I have the chance, I would like to buy it back and open a small shop.</p>
    <p>“The cost of op­er­at­ing a chain of eater­ies is very high, but it can still work as a sin­gle-shop con­cept.”</p>
    <p>“I would like to bring back the old-style cakes,” he added.</p>
    <p>Bakerzin was known for its choco­late cake made with Val­rhona choco­late and straw­berry short­cake in its early days.</p>
    <p>Tay sold the business dur­ing the fi­nan­cial cri­sis be­cause rental costs were too high.</p>
    <p>“I was a small player and thought I would let some­one else take over in­stead,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Sim­i­larly, I wish the cur­rent own­ers had cho­sen not to close, but to pass the business on to some­one else.”</p>
