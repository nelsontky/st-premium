    <p>This is the 10th in The Straits Times se­ries by Se­nior Law Cor­re­spon­dent K.C. Vi­jayan on le­gal is­sues, with each edi­tion tied to an area of law. Today’s ar­ti­cles are cen­tred on re­struc­tur­ing and in­sol­vency, in­clud­ing a look at Sin­ga­pore’s role as a re­gional hub as the Covid-19 pan­demic claims more firms and a Sin­ga­porean award win­ner in the field.</p>
    <p>Re­cent debt re­struc­tur­ing cases un­der­score Sin­ga­pore’s po­si­tion as a re­gional in­sol­vency hub, with the lat­est be­ing a note hold­ers’ goa­head last week for a Jakarta-based con­glom­er­ate’s scheme to re­struc­ture US$231 mil­lion (S$311 mil­lion) of se­cured notes due next year.</p>
    <p>The note hold­ers, who are a class of cred­i­tors of PT MNC In­ves­tama hold­ing at least 75 per cent value of the claims, voted last Thurs­day in favour of the “pre-pack­aged” scheme of ar­range­ment.</p>
    <p>In a pre-pack­aged scheme, a debtor com­pany can seek court sanc­tion for a scheme with­out the need to go to court first to get leave to con­vene a statu­tory meet­ing, if the court is con­vinced the scheme would have passed, had a meet­ing been called.</p>
    <p>PT MNC had ear­lier this year ob­tained a mora­to­rium against cred­i­tor en­force­ment on the com­pany’s as­sets from the Sin­ga­pore High Court, said lawyer Tan Mei Yen, head of the in­sol­vency and re­struc­tur­ing prac­tice at Oon & Bazul.</p>
    <p>“This pre-pack­aged ar­range­ment pro­ce­dure is par­tic­u­larly suited for less con­tentious re­struc­tur­ings where the sig­nif­i­cant ma­jor­ity of the com­pany’s cred­i­tors are sup­port­ive of the scheme. In such cases, the pro­ce­dure saves the time and costs as­so­ci­ated with the con­ven­ing of a statu­tory meet­ing, which also in­cludes a court ap­pli­ca­tion for leave to con­vene the meet­ing,” she said.</p>
    <p>PT MNC, whose busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties in­clude me­dia, fi­nan­cial ser­vices and life­style prop­erty, had is­sued US$231 mil­lion of the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX)-listed se­nior se­cured notes due in 2021.</p>
    <p>In­vok­ing the In­sol­vency, Re­struc­tur­ing and Dis­so­lu­tion Act (IRDA), the firm aimed, through the ar­range­ment scheme, to re­place the notes due next year with a mix of new notes and new shares, as it faced fi­nan­cial dis­rup­tion from the Covid-19 pan­demic, said the Global Re­struc­tur­ing Re­view, a London-based global pub­li­ca­tion on cross-bor­der re­struc­tur­ing and in­sol­vency law, last month.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan said: “We have found the pre-pack­aged scheme of ar­range­ment pro­ce­dure to be pop­u­lar with In­done­sian com­pa­nies seek­ing to re­struc­ture their bonds is­sued on SGX – we are cur­rently ad­vis­ing at least one other ma­jor In­done­sian group of com­pa­nies in re­la­tion to a sim­i­lar pro­ce­dure.”</p>
    <p>She said the ap­pli­ca­tion by PT MNC for mora­to­rium pro­tec­tion un­der the IRDA is sig­nif­i­cant, be­cause it is the first In­done­sian com­pany known to have made such an ap­pli­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“The High Court de­ci­sion on the ap­pli­ca­tion ear­lier this year lends clar­ity and opens the door to other for­eign com­pa­nies in sim­i­lar po­si­tions to seek to re­struc­ture in Sin­ga­pore, and to ap­ply for the mora­to­rium pro­tec­tion that is avail­able un­der Sin­ga­pore’s re­struc­tur­ing regime.”</p>
    <p>She added that In­done­sia-based Modern­land group very re­cently ob­tained mora­to­rium pro­tec­tion in Sin­ga­pore and is sim­i­larly seek­ing to adopt a pre-pack­aged scheme of ar­range­ment.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try play­ers an­tic­i­pate that given the eco­nomic dis­tress caused by Covid-19 in the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion, more com­pa­nies will look to Sin­ga­pore to carry out their re­struc­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>“Cross-bor­der in­sol­ven­cies are re­garded as a po­ten­tial growth area, and there would be more im­pe­tus and op­por­tu­nity for for­eign in­sol­vency cases to be ven­ti­lated or other­wise dealt with in Sin­ga­pore,” said se­nior law part­ner Justin Chan from Tito Isaac & Co.</p>
    <p>Black­Oak man­ag­ing part­ner Ashok Ku­mar said: “Sin­ga­pore’s rise as a re­struc­tur­ing and in­sol­vency hub will help to boost the le­gal and fi­nan­cial ser­vices sec­tor in the coun­try and grow the mar­ket.”</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore mar­ket has also seen a rise in re­struc­tur­ing and in­sol­vency ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Veteran lawyer Beatrice Yeo said there have been con­cerns raised here over firms com­mer­cially af­fected by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>She noted that the Govern­ment has been ad­dress­ing this area with moves such as a debt mora­to­rium.</p>
    <p>“At Yeo & As­so­ci­ates, we see a surge in com­pa­nies and in­di­vid­u­als seek­ing vi­able meth­ods to pro­vide as­sur­ance to their cred­i­tors, and also to pace their fi­nan­cial obli­ga­tions to banks and fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions,” said Ms Yeo, the firm’s founder and man­ag­ing direc­tor.</p>
    <p>“They are ac­tu­ally do­ing their best to be re­spon­si­ble for their fi</p>
    <p>nan­cial debts and li­a­bil­i­ties. The new laws would pro­vide an eas­ier exit for clearly un­sus­tain­able busi­nesses,” she added.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try re­cruit­ment spe­cial­ist Lee Shulin said the surge in in­ter­est in re­struc­tur­ing and in­sol­vency (R&I) has led to an in­crease in de­mand for lawyers with ex­per­tise in</p>
    <p>the area over the last three years.</p>
    <p>“There is a group of lawyers who get a con­tin­u­ous stream of R&I in­struc­tions, such as in bou­tique dis­pute firms, and this group of lawyers has been steadily in­creas­ing,” she added.</p>
    <p>“Such de­vel­op­ments and move­ments make man­i­fest the sig­nif­i­cance of the in­dus­try as an up and com­ing area,” said Ms Lee, who is co-founder and direc­tor of le­gal and com­pli­ance re­cruit­ment firm Ansa Search.</p>
