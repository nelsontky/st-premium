    <p>Sin­ga­pore and China’s Shan­dong prov­ince can deepen their co­op­er­a­tion in trade and con­nec­tiv­ity, sus­tain­abil­ity and mod­ern ser­vices, said Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for For­eign Af­fairs and Trans­port Chee Hong Tat yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Chee, who also co-chairs the Sin­ga­pore-Shan­dong Busi­ness Coun­cil, told vir­tual par­tic­i­pants at the 22nd coun­cil meet­ing: “Sin­ga­pore and Shan­dong can work hand in hand to deepen, strengthen and ac­cel­er­ate our co­op­er­a­tion, so that we can over­come the chal­lenges dur­ing this pan­demic and emerge stronger to­gether af­ter the cri­sis.”</p>
    <p>He said that de­spite the Covid-19 pan­demic, two-way trade be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Shan­dong grew sig­nif­i­cantly this year, reach­ing a to­tal of US$3.6 bil­lion (S$4.9 bil­lion) in the first nine months. This marks a year-on-year growth of 117 per cent.</p>
    <p>The fig­ures in­clude trad­ing ac­tiv­i­ties by Sin­ga­pore com­pa­nies that im­ported food and med­i­cal sup­plies such as sur­gi­cal masks from Shan­dong.</p>
    <p>Shan­dong is now Sin­ga­pore’s fifth-largest des­ti­na­tion for in­vest­ment in China, af­ter the prov­inces of Jiangsu and Guang­dong, and the mu­nic­i­pal­i­ties of Shang­hai and Chongqing. Last year, Sin­ga­pore’s for­eign di­rect i nvest­ment i nto Shan­dong reached US$750 mil­lion, across 70 projects.</p>
    <p>Mr Chee said: “There is op­por­tu­nity for Chi­nese ex­porters to broaden the range of ex­ported pro­duce from Shan­dong to Sin­ga­pore, in­clud­ing pre­mium fruits and veg­eta­bles such as cher­ries and black gar­lic.</p>
    <p>“Be­yond meet­ing our do­mes­tic de­mand, we are also happy to work with the Shan­dong gov­ern­ment to in­crease food trade with South­east Asia and other re­gions, us­ing Sin­ga­pore as a trad­ing hub.”</p>
    <p>He said progress has been made in help­ing Sin­ga­pore com­pa­nies par­tic­i­pate in Shan­dong’s eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion, pro­mot­ing the in­ter­na­tion­al­i­sa­tion of Shan­dong en­ter­prises through Sin­ga­pore, and strength­en­ing peo­pleto-peo­ple ex­changes.</p>
    <p>Co­op­er­a­tion can also be strength­ened in sus­tain­abil­ity, he added, as both Sin­ga­pore and China work to de­velop so­lu­tions for a cleaner and greener en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies from both coun­tries can also ac­cel­er­ate their part­ner­ships in mod­ern ser­vices. Sin­ga­pore’s fi­nan­cial ser­vices com­pa­nies and law firms, with their ex­ten­sive net­works and ex­pe­ri­ence in South­east Asia, can be good part­ners to Shan­dong com­pa­nies look­ing to in­ter­na­tion­alise, Mr Chee said.</p>
    <p>To in­crease col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween both coun­tries, five part­ner­ships were signed be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Shan­dong or­gan­i­sa­tions. The sign­ings were wit­nessed by</p>
    <p>Mr Chee and Shan­dong Vice-Gov­er­nor Ren Airong.</p>
    <p>They in­clude a tie-up be­tween two tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies to set up busi­nesses in China and Asean mar­kets, and a part­ner­ship be­tween an ed­u­ca­tion group here and the Qing­dao Blue Sil­i­con Val­ley ad­min­is­tra­tive com­mit­tee to de­velop tal­ent in vo­ca­tional ed­u­ca­tion in Qing­dao.</p>
    <p>A Sin­ga­pore wa­ter treat­ment com­pany also inked an agree­ment with the Yicheng dis­trict gov­ern­ment for the con­struc­tion of the town­ship and in­dus­trial park sewage net­work.</p>
    <p>Mr Chee said: “It may be chal­leng­ing for com­pa­nies to en­ter new mar­kets now due to the Covid-19 pan­demic. We will over­come Covid-19 – it is a ques­tion of when.</p>
    <p>“Com­pa­nies should use this pe­riod to pre­pare them­selves by un­der­stand­ing the mar­ket op­por­tu­ni­ties and find­ing po­ten­tial part­ners, so that they are ready to move swiftly when the global econ­omy re­cov­ers.”</p>
