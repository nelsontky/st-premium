    <p>Tall peo­ple tend to show more con­fi­dence. I can’t say the same for tall cars.</p>
    <p>The new and mas­sive MercedesBe­nz GLE450, stand­ing at nearly 1.8m, has the gait of an ele­phant on stilts. Its woolly steer­ing makes a mam­moth task of keep­ing the multi-seat sport util­ity ve­hi­cle (SUV) from prun­ing shrubs or kiss­ing kerbs around bends. Even go­ing straight is oc­ca­sion­ally iffy, as the slight­est in­den­ta­tion seems to un­set­tle the 2.2-tonne beast.</p>
    <p>The re­tail vari­ant has air sus­pen­sion and should be­have bet­ter. But we can­not say for sure be­cause the test-car has steel springs.</p>
    <p>Good thing the car is equipped with all man­ner of elec­tronic aids to help you stay in lane.</p>
    <p>Yet, not all big and tall cars are so un­wieldy. The BMW X5, for ex­am­ple, is a bal­le­rina in com­par­i­son.</p>
    <p>Mea­sur­ing nearly 5m long and just a tad over 2m wide, the GLE – which is based on the Mer­cedes E-class – is size­ably larger than its pre­de­ces­sor. And at 1,797mm (the test-car), it is just as tall.</p>
    <p>De­spite its di­men­sions, MercedesBe­nz claims the new GLE has a more rigid struc­ture. This is not quite ev­i­dent at the helm, but per­haps in the way the car man­ages to keep noise and vi­bra­tion at bay.</p>
    <p>In that re­spect, the GLE450 is a com­pe­tent pas­sen­ger ve­hi­cle, even if it pales as a driver’s car.</p>
    <p>With a 2,995mm wheel­base (an ad­di­tional 80mm), in­te­rior space is ad­e­quate, es­pe­cially for those in the sec­ond row. Here, they can ad­just their seats in­di­vid­u­ally to get the best po­si­tion for that long haul.</p>
    <p>The third row is com­fort­able enough for pint-size, screen-glued pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>If this last row is oc­cu­pied, stowage is rather lim­ited. But if it is not, you can free up a size­able boot.</p>
    <p>Front-row oc­cu­pants also get more room, thanks to a more up­right A-pil­lar. There is also less need to</p>
    <p>duck as you get in and out. While side-steps are su­per­flu­ous in some other SUVs, the ones on the GLE come in handy for not-so-tall folks.</p>
    <p>The car is pow­ered by a 3-litre tur­bocharged six-cylin­der mak­ing 367hp and 500Nm. Mated to a nine-speed au­to­box, it drives all four wheels. A vari­able four-wheeldrive sys­tem ap­por­tions torque in­fin­itely be­tween axles.</p>
    <p>As pow­er­trains go though, this set-up seems un­der­whelm­ing for such a big car. For starters, the GLE450 feels more slug­gish than what its de­clared 5.7-sec­ond cen­tury sprint sug­gests.</p>
    <p>Its rel­a­tively high rolling re­sis­tance does not help. Lift your foot off the ac­cel­er­a­tor on a flat road and it slows down like a hy­brid with en­ergy re­cu­per­a­tion.</p>
    <p>In­ci­den­tally, the new GLE has a 48-volt “mild hy­brid” sys­tem which aids ef­fi­ciency. The test-car av­er­aged 12 litres/100km, which is no­tice­ably poorer than the 9.1 litres/100km de­clared by Mer­cedes.</p>
    <p>It is only when it is cruis­ing on the high­way that it con­veys a sem­blance of ef­fort­less­ness. Mer­cedes says it will peak at 250kmh, but I imag­ine that pace in this car might cause white knuck­les and fur­rowed brows.</p>
    <p>Pas­sen­gers, how­ever, will be obliv­i­ous to the strug­gles at the helm as they sit co­cooned in the GLE’s lux­u­ri­ous cli­mate-con­trolled cabin.</p>
