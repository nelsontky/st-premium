    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tain ex­pects to have 10 mil­lion doses of Pfizer and BioN­Tech’s can­di­date Covid-19 vac­cine avail­able by the end of the year, but Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son on Mon­day said there were sev­eral hur­dles to go af­ter its pos­i­tive clin­i­cal trial re­sults.</p>
    <p>Pfizer said its ex­per­i­men­tal Covid-19 vac­cine was more than 90 per cent ef­fec­tive, a big gain in the fight against a pan­demic that has killed more than a mil­lion peo­ple and bat­tered the world’s econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son said Bri­tain had now or­dered 40 mil­lion doses of the can­di­date vac­cine de­vel­oped by Pfizer and BioN­Tech, enough to give pro­tec­tion to a third of the coun­try’s pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>His spokesman said 10 mil­lion doses were due by the end of this year pend­ing reg­u­la­tory ap­proval.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son has said that the prospects of a vac­cine are one cause for op­ti­mism that the sit­u­a­tion will im­prove by spring, but said new lock­down rules in Eng­land still needed to be obeyed even though sci­en­tific progress was on the hori­zon.</p>
    <p>“We have cleared one sig­nif­i­cant hur­dle but there are sev­eral more to go be­fore we know the vac­cine can be used,” he said, re­fer­ring to the need to see safety data and for ap­proval by reg­u­la­tors.</p>
    <p>“We ab­so­lutely can­not rely on this as a so­lu­tion. The big­gest mis­take we could make now would be to slacken our re­solve at such a crit­i­cal mo­ment.”</p>
    <p>Mr John­son, who was hos­pi­talised ear­lier this year af­ter be­ing stricken with Covid-19, said that once the vac­cine is ap­proved, Bri­tain would be ready to start us­ing it.</p>
    <p>The health ser­vice would lead a pro­gramme of dis­tri­bu­tion, with the el­derly and front-line work­ers first in line.</p>
    <p>“I am hope­ful, but not yet cer­tain, that we could be­gin to see some vac­cine by Christ­mas,” said</p>
    <p>Eng­land’s deputy chief med­i­cal of­fice Jonathan Van-Tam.</p>
    <p>In all, the gov­ern­ment has signed six sup­ply deals for vac­cine can­di­dates, in­clud­ing Pfizer and BioN­Tech’s and one de­vel­oped by Ox­ford Univer­sity and As­traZeneca.</p>
    <p>Ox­ford regius pro­fes­sor of medicine John Bell, who sits on the gov­ern­ment’s vac­cine task force, told BBC Ra­dio that he could not see “any rea­son now why we shouldn’t have a hand­ful of good vac­cines avail­able to this dis­ease”.</p>
    <p>He added that he was “op­ti­mistic that given this re­sult, we’ll have a rea­son­ably good chance of get­ting a good re­sult as well”, re­fer­ring to Ox­ford’s own late-stage trial re­sults that he said would come in “weeks, not months”.</p>
    <p>Asked if life would be re­turn­ing to nor­mal by the spring, he said: “Yes, yes, yes.</p>
    <p>“I’m prob­a­bly the first guy to say that but... I will say that with some con­fi­dence.”</p>
