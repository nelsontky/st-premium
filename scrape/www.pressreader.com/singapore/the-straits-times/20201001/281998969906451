    <p>“I’m an il­lit­er­ate” would be an awk­ward ad­mis­sion in any so­ci­ety. Ad­mit­ting one’s in­nu­mer­acy, how­ever, very much de­pends on the cul­ture.</p>
    <p>My many en­coun­ters while liv­ing in North Amer­ica sug­gest that quite a sub­stan­tial seg­ment of the pop­u­la­tion wouldn’t hes­i­tate to say: “I’m not good at math­e­mat­ics.” I am in­clined to be­lieve that many peo­ple to­day wouldn’t be em­bar­rassed to say out loud: “I’m not good at those dig­i­tal things.”</p>
    <p>But are we re­ally clear about what dig­i­tal lit­er­acy means?</p>
    <p>In think­ing about this is­sue, are we in a way re­peat­ing the para­ble of the blind men and the ele­phant, mis­tak­ing the part for the whole? We need to zoom out to get a broader view of dig­i­tal lit­er­acy. It is not sim­ply a mat­ter of se­man­tics be­cause of the real-life im­pli­ca­tions that fol­low from our un­der­stand­ing of the con­cept.</p>
    <p>With prac­ti­cally ev­ery­thing dig­i­tally con­nected th­ese days, we are of­ten bom­barded with com­ments and advice on what it takes to sur­vive the Fourth</p>
    <p>In­dus­trial Rev­o­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>It was with this thought in mind that I asked my­self the other day: “Am I dig­i­tally lit­er­ate?”</p>
    <p>Com­pared with my stu­dents and younger staff, I am clumsy when it comes to us­ing mo­bile de­vices and still feel un­com­fort­able with mul­ti­task­ing on a com­puter. Young peo­ple have no such prob­lems.</p>
    <p>But their ease with cod­ing and gad­getry is not suf­fi­cient for them to thrive in a world that de­mands dig­i­tal lit­er­acy.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal lit­er­acy, like many things in life, has sev­eral facets and dif­fer­ent shades.</p>
    <p>First, a pos­i­tive and em­brac­ing at­ti­tude to­wards dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy is a nec­es­sary first step to­wards dig­i­tal lit­er­acy. Sub­jec­tive feeling de­ter­mines how we hu­mans frame and deal with a mat­ter. “I’m not good at maths” re­flects an at­ti­tude that can by it­self be an im­ped­i­ment to ac­quir­ing the nec­es­sary skills in that field. The same ap­plies to dig­i­tal lit­er­acy.</p>
    <p>It does not take high in­tel­li­gence to ac­quire basic read­ing and writ­ing skills. By ex­ten­sion, it won’t take too much ef­fort to be in a po­si­tion to ap­pre­ci­ate and ap­ply dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy at the elementary level if the men­tal bar­rier can be crossed.</p>
    <p>Most se­niors to­day have gone from re­ly­ing on snail mail to e-mail to text mes­sag­ing to voice/video chats. In a way, we have al­ready be­come dig­i­tally lit­er­ate con­sumers even though some of us may still be clumsy in us­ing elec­tronic de­vices.</p>
    <p>CON­SUMERS AND SER­VICE PROVIDERS</p>
    <p>And yet be­ing able to read, write and speak a lan­guage does not guar­an­tee that one can make a liv­ing as an ed­i­tor, writer or stand-up co­me­dian. Why should we then ex­pect that mas­ter­ing the use of com­mon dig­i­tal gad­gets can en­hance one’s job prospects in this dig­i­tal era?</p>
    <p>We can be clumsy as con­sumers of goods and ser­vices in­volv­ing dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy but still be tol­er­ated be­cause our money, not skills, gives us that priv­i­lege.</p>
    <p>On the sup­ply side though, only value-added propo­si­tions can at­tract in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>Must-have dig­i­tal lit­er­acy in or­der to do well in the new econ­omy is far more com­plex and de­pen­dent on a num­ber of con­tin­gent fac­tors.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, a young per­son pro­fi­cient in cod­ing blockchain­s but lack­ing knowl­edge in data an­a­lytics is dig­i­tally lit­er­ate but lim­ited in the same way a mono­lin­gual per­son is less adap­tive than one who is mul­ti­lin­gual.</p>
    <p>Yes, there will be a cod­ing job wait­ing for this young per­son if blockchain­s re­main a hot area. But bear in mind we are talk­ing about a rapidly evolv­ing sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, a per­son’s job prospects and the level of dig­i­tal lit­er­acy re­quired of him de­pend very much on which part of the value chain he in­tends to oc­cupy.</p>
    <p>A su­per coder will get many good job of­fers but one able to ef­fec­tively man­age a project in­volv­ing dig­i­tal prod­ucts or ser­vices will land a bet­ter job. The abil­ity to con­cep­tu­alise suc­cess­ful dig­i­tal prod­ucts/ser­vices brings even greater re­wards. Hav­ing an eye to spot a great ven­ture early on can make you rich in this dig­i­tal era even if you are not the most adept at us­ing dig­i­tal gad­gets.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy evolves at a quick pace. Nar­row dig­i­tal skills may prove to have a short shelf life. One can be dig­i­tally lit­er­ate in a nar­row sense but still lack the mar­ketable dig­i­tal skills that ap­peal to po­ten­tial em­ploy­ers. Con­tin­ual learn­ing is re­quired as in­di­vid­u­als strive to move on from be­ing a dig­i­tal tech­ni­cian to a man­ager of dig­i­tal ap­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>It is in a broader sense that I con­sider my­self dig­i­tally lit­er­ate even though I have never coded a blockchain al­go­rithm. But I have read up enough to un­der­stand how blockchain­s work and know their po­ten­tial and lim­i­ta­tions. That has en­abled me to bet­ter as­sess is­sues such as the fu­ture of dig­i­tal cur­ren­cies and of­fer advice ac­cord­ingly.</p>
    <p>STRUC­TURAL DIG­I­TAL KNOWL­EDGE</p>
    <p>I will go be­yond the cliche “in­for­ma­tion does not equal knowl­edge” to say that knowl­edge isn’t equiv­a­lent to struc­tural knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>Why so? Watch­ing a cou­ple of episodes of ma­rine mam­mals on Dis­cov­ery Chan­nel won’t turn us into trained ma­rine bi­ol­o­gists.</p>
    <p>Knowl­edge is use­ful but struc­tural knowl­edge makes one an ex­pert. Real cod­ing skills in the Python lan­guage can’t, for ex­am­ple, be learnt by just watch­ing a few YouTube videos. Cod­ing skills can be de­vel­oped only by learn­ing the prin­ci­ples, prac­tis­ing of­ten and re­ceiv­ing feed­back/guid­ance in a struc­tured way.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing struc­tural knowl­edge also makes it eas­ier for a per­son to ac­quire an­other set of con­nected struc­tural knowl­edge. If Python falls out of favour, one can quickly learn the new lan­guage of the day to still possess the wanted dig­i­tal lit­er­acy in this fast-chang­ing world.</p>
    <p>HOPE FOR US ALL</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy can be a won­der­ful thing but may also un­leash tremen­dously dis­rup­tive forces. The mov­ing train of dig­i­tal rev­o­lu­tion is ob­vi­ously un­stop­pable, and many con­ven­tional jobs will in time dis­ap­pear.</p>
    <p>A gov­ern­ment, no mat­ter how will­ing and ca­pable, can only help ease the tran­si­tional pain of dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion be­ing ex­pe­ri­enced by a sig­nif­i­cant seg­ment of the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The spec­trum of dig­i­tal lit­er­acy is wide. Un­der­stand­ing the im­pli­ca­tions of dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy on one’s line of work is as im­por­tant as hav­ing some level of tech­ni­cal pro­fi­ciency in work­ing with ex­ist­ing dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Not ev­ery­one can be a gifted coder or an ap­pli­ca­tions vi­sion­ary, but ev­ery in­di­vid­ual of work­ing age can and will need to en­hance dig­i­tal lit­er­acy skills to the best of his or her abil­ity. With some re­tool­ing and a pos­i­tive at­ti­tude, many of us will be able to find a dig­i­tal niche that suits our in­di­vid­ual cir­cum­stances; that is the key to rid­ing the wave of what­ever changes that come our way.</p>
