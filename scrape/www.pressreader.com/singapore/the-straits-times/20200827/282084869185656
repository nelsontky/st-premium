    <p>A man went on the run for about 19 years af­ter cheat­ing three peo­ple of more than $6,600 in to­tal.</p>
    <p>For­mer sales ex­ec­u­tive Wong Chee Kuan is be­lieved to have fled to Thai­land be­fore he fi­nally sur­ren­dered him­self to the Sin­ga­pore au­thor­i­ties ear­lier this year. Court doc­u­ments did not re­veal why he de­cided to re­turn here.</p>
    <p>The 46-year-old Sin­ga­porean was sen­tenced on Tues­day to seven months’ jail af­ter plead­ing guilty to three counts of cheat­ing.</p>
    <p>Wong used to work at a com­pany known as Auto As­sist Global, which was then lo­cated in Up­per Thom­son Road. It sold an­nual mem­ber­ships for Ad­mi­ralty Re­sort and Coun­try Club and also of­fered a pro­gramme which pro­vided un­lim­ited car wash ser­vices.</p>
    <p>On Jan 29, 1996, a man iden­ti­fied as Mo­hamed Foad Buang con­tacted the firm and Wong told him about its ser­vices. Mr Foad then agreed to pay for the car wash pro­gramme and coun­try club mem­ber­ship.</p>
    <p>Wong ar­ranged to meet Mr Foad at Hock Hin En­gi­neer­ing in Bukit Merah Lane the next day.</p>
    <p>Wong turned up at 10.30am on Jan 30, 1996, and or­dered a CD player and four cas­sette play­ers worth nearly $1,400 in to­tal.</p>
    <p>Mr Foad ar­rived about two hours later. He passed his credit card to Wong who used it to pay for his goods in­stead.</p>
    <p>In an­other in­ci­dent, Wong cheated an­other man, iden­ti­fied as Mr Mohd Hashim Abu Oth­man.</p>
    <p>Mr Hashim went to Auto As­sist Global on Feb 22, 1996, to sign up for the car wash pro­gramme and Wong at­tended to him.</p>
    <p>The court heard that $288 was later charged to Mr Hashim’s credit card for the ser­vice. On March 1 that year, Wong went to Mr Hashim’s home and told him that credit card pay­ments would “take a long time” to be pro­cessed.</p>
    <p>Wong then lied to Mr Hashim, claim­ing that he had paid $288 in cash to the firm on his vic­tim’s be­half. Wong also said that the com­pany would void the ear­lier credit card pay­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Hashim be­lieved him and handed over a cheque for the amount, only to find out later that he had been duped af­ter re­ceiv­ing his bank state­ment.</p>
    <p>Separately, in Novem­ber 2000, Wong duped a woman, Madam Jessie Wee, i nto hand­ing him $5,000 in cash af­ter claim­ing that he needed the money to pay his fa­ther’s hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion bill.</p>
    <p>Madam Wee, who agreed to loan him the amount, later re­ceived from Wong a cheque for $5,000 and banked it in.</p>
    <p>Later that month, she re­ceived a bank no­tice stat­ing that t he cheque could not be hon­oured as the ac­count linked to it had been closed.</p>
