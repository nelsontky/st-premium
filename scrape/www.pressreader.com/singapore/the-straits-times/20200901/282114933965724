    <p>The dis­lodg­ing of a ven­ti­la­tion duct from the ceil­ing of a cin­ema hall at Nex shop­ping mall on Sun­day was pos­si­bly a re­sult of weak­en­ing duct sup­ports, such as loose nuts and bolts or spalling con­crete slabs, said in­dus­trial experts here.</p>
    <p>Th­ese ducts carry cool air from a cen­tral air-con­di­tion­ing sys­tem to dif­fer­ent parts of a build­ing.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Daniel Wong from the de­part­ment of build­ing at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s School of De­sign and En­vi­ron­ment said that the duct is usu­ally bolted to metal rods that are se­cured to a con­crete ceil­ing slab.</p>
    <p>“For the ven­ti­la­tion duct to fall, there are three main pos­si­bil­i­ties: a dam­aged rod, nuts and bolts which are loose or faulty, or that the con­crete slab is be­gin­ning to rust or break,” ex­plained Prof Wong.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, based on the pho­tos of the dis­lodged duct, it seems that the metal rod is still in­tact and re­mains con­nected to the duct, so there is a higher pos­si­bil­ity for the other two sce­nar­ios,” he said.</p>
    <p>Prof Wong, who has been in the projects and fa­cil­i­ties man­age­ment in­dus­try for over 20 years, said he has seen only three or four cases of ven­ti­la­tion ducts be­com­ing dis­lodged.</p>
    <p>In those cases, the rod was ac­ci­den­tally hit dur­ing clean­ing, or nuts and bolts that had been re­moved dur­ing main­te­nance had not been se­curely tight­ened.</p>
    <p>Prof Wong said that to pre­vent such ac­ci­dents, th­ese parts have to be reg­u­larly re­placed once their prod­uct life cy­cle has been reached, and car­ry­ing out reg­u­lar in­spec­tions can de­tect wear and tear early.</p>
    <p>Project man­ager Zaw Myo Lwin, who works at a lo­cal air-con­di­tion­ing main­te­nance com­pany, noted that the metal rods at­tached to the ducts are typ­i­cally able to carry a weight of be­tween 50kg and 100kg.</p>
    <p>How­ever, based on the pho­tos of the dis­lodged duct at Shaw Theatres Nex, the likely weight for its size would be around 20kg, he said. Hence he sus­pects that it was a drop-in an­chor, a type of fas­tener which se­cures the duct to the con­crete, that be­came loose.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times, a spokesman for the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity said that a pro­fes­sional en­gi­neer has been ap­pointed to in­ves­ti­gate the in­ci­dent, along with other ducts in the cin­ema.</p>
    <p>Rec­ti­fi­ca­tion mea­sures will be rec­om­mended de­pend­ing on the find­ings, and th­ese will be car­ried out by the build­ing owner, she added.</p>
