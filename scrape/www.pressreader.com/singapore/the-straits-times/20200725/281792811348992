    <p>• The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) is see­ing in­tense transmissi­on of the coro­n­avirus in rel­a­tively few coun­tries, its chief Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus said on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“We con­tinue to see in­tense transmissi­on in a rel­a­tively small group of coun­tries,” he told a vir­tual brief­ing in Geneva. “Two-thirds of all cases are from 10 coun­tries. Al­most half of all cases re­ported so far are from just three coun­tries.”</p>
    <p>United States coro­n­avirus cases ex­ceeded four mil­lion on Thurs­day, with over 2,600 new cases every hour on av­er­age, the high­est rate in the world, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters tally. In­fec­tions in the US have rapidly ac­cel­er­ated since the first case was de­tected on Jan 21.</p>
    <p>It took the coun­try 98 days to reach one mil­lion cases. It took an­other 43 days to reach two mil­lion, and then 27 days to reach three mil­lion.</p>
    <p>It has taken only 16 days to reach four mil­lion at a rate of 43 new cases a minute.</p>
    <p>Dr Te­dros also said that just be­cause cases may be at a low level where some­one lives does not mean that he should let down his guard. “Know your sit­u­a­tion – do you know how many cases were re­ported where you live yes­ter­day? Do you know how to find that in­for­ma­tion? Do you know how to min­imise your ex­po­sure?” he said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a Chi­nese city of nearly six mil­lion peo­ple will in­tro­duce a wave of coro­n­avirus test­ing to stamp out a small clus­ter of cases, the au­thor­i­ties said yes­ter­day, with state me­dia re­port­ing that com­mu­ni­ties will be locked down.</p>
    <p>Since the virus first sur­faced in the cen­tral city of Wuhan late last year, the coun­try’s of­fi­cial num­ber of in­fec­tions has been re­stricted to a trickle, mainly among ar­rivals from abroad. All mass lock­downs have been lifted. But re­cent do­mes­tic out­breaks have proven the dif­fi­culty of stamp­ing out the con­ta­gion en­tirely.</p>
    <p>The port city of Dalian in north-east­ern Liaon­ing prov­ince has re­ported three cases in re­cent days af­ter go­ing nearly four months with­out any. The fresh out­break has been linked to a seafood pro­cess­ing com­pany that deals with im­ported prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the Dalian health com­mis­sion said the city had to “quickly en­ter wartime mode, go all out, mo­bilise all peo­ple and res­o­lutely curb the spread of the epi­demic”.</p>
    <p>It an­nounced strict new mea­sures, in­clud­ing on-thes­pot nu­cleic acid tests for ev­ery­one tak­ing the sub­way line that passes the af­fected seafood com­pany. Kinder­gartens and nurs­eries have been closed, and some com­mu­ni­ties have been placed un­der lock­down, ac­cord­ing to the state-run Global Times news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>The city au­thor­i­ties said they would test more than 190,000 peo­ple, in­clud­ing em­ploy­ees at shop­ping malls, whole­sale mar­kets and warehouses.</p>
    <p>The out­break comes as hun­dreds of foot­ball play­ers from the Chi­nese Su­per League – which will kick off its much de­layed sea­son to­day – are in a sealed-off ho­tel in the city. The league’s 16 teams have been split into two groups for the first games of the dras­ti­cally re­jigged sea­son, with the oth­ers to be played in Suzhou, near Shanghai.</p>
    <p>The lat­est clus­ter has turned the spot­light on the coun­try’s food sup­ply chain, and China has banned im­ports from a num­ber of over­seas food pro­duc­ers in­volved in virus out­breaks. One Chi­nese im­porter told Agence France-Presse that ex­porters had ear­lier been asked to guar­an­tee that their ship­ments were not con­tam­i­nated.</p>
    <p>A doc­u­ment pub­lished on Thurs­day by China’s State Coun­cil also warned that the coun­try’s pub­lic health sys­tem should pre­pare for a pos­si­ble sec­ond wave of the virus in the win­ter.</p>
    <p>At a press con­fer­ence ear­lier this month, of­fi­cials said sam­ples taken from white­leg shrimp pack­ag­ing in Dalian had tested pos­i­tive for the virus.</p>
    <p>China re­ported 21 new coro­n­avirus cases for Thurs­day, com­pared with 22 cases a day ear­lier, the health com­mis­sion said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Of the new in­fec­tions, 13 were in the far western re­gion of Xin­jiang, ac­cord­ing to a state­ment by the Na­tional Health Com­mis­sion. Two were in Dalian city, while the re­main­ing six were im­ported cases.</p>
