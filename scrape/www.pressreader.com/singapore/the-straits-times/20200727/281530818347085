    <p>Amid all the at­ten­tion on the fight against the coronaviru­s pan­demic, the other bat­tle against dengue is also a cause for con­cern as the num­ber of cases con­tin­ues to rise.</p>
    <p>And while both are vi­ral in­fec­tions that are present with fever, doc­tors say there are sev­eral fea­tures that dif­fer­en­ti­ate them.</p>
    <p>Nine­teen peo­ple have died from dengue fever this year – only eight fewer than the num­ber of Covid-19 deaths.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 1,733 dengue cases were re­ported from July 12 to 18 – the high­est num­ber of weekly cases recorded in Sin­ga­pore, ac­cord­ing to data from the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency. It was the sixth week run­ning with more than 1,000 cases. As of July 20, more than 18,900 peo­ple have been in­fected this year.</p>
    <p>Dr Ed­win Chng, med­i­cal direc­tor at Park­way Shen­ton, said: “The public has mainly been riv­eted by the pan­demic for the last seven to eight months be­cause, un­der­stand­ably, the virus is new and rel­a­tively un­known, hence it triggers fears and con­cerns.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, in view of the re­cent es­ca­la­tion of dengue cases and deaths, it is im­por­tant we pay at­ten­tion to fight­ing dengue fever as well.”</p>
    <p>Un­like Covid-19, dengue is not spread di­rectly from per­son to per­son. It is trans­mit­ted through the bite of an in­fected Aedes mos­quito.</p>
    <p>A mos­quito be­comes in­fected when it bites a dengue-in­fected per­son. When it bites other peo­ple, it trans­mits the virus to them.</p>
    <p>Dengue symp­toms in­clude a sud­den on­set of fever that lasts be­tween two and seven days, se­vere headache and pain be­hind the eyes, nau­sea and vom­it­ing, and joint and muscle ache.</p>
    <p>Se­vere dengue de­vel­ops three to seven days af­ter the first signs of ill­ness with wors­en­ing symp­toms, such as se­vere ab­dom­i­nal pain, per­sis­tent vom­it­ing, bleed­ing gums, vom­it­ing blood, rapid breath­ing and fa­tigue or rest­less­ness.</p>
    <p>The public has mainly been riv­eted by the pan­demic for the last seven to eight months... How­ever, in view of the re­cent es­ca­la­tion of dengue cases and deaths, it is im­por­tant we pay at­ten­tion to fight­ing dengue fever as well. ’’</p>
    <p>DR ED­WIN CHNG , med­i­cal direc­tor at Park­way Shen­ton</p>
    <p>Se­vere dengue, also known as dengue haem­or­rhagic fever, can cause the num­ber of platelets – tiny blood cells that help the body to form clots to stop bleed­ing – to fall dan­ger­ously low, lead­ing to bleed­ing in the in­ter­nal or­gans, a sud­den drop in blood pres­sure and death.</p>
    <p>Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an in­fec­tious dis­ease spe­cial­ist at Mount El­iz­a­beth Novena Hospi­tal, wrote in on­line health and well­ness Web re­source Health Plus: “Rare but known com­pli­ca­tions of dengue in­clude my­ocardi­tis (in­flam­ma­tion of the heart), re­sult­ing in se­vere and pro­found hy­poten­sion (low blood pres­sure), heart fail­ure and dam­age to pe­riph­eral nerves.”</p>
    <p>Dr Ni­cholas Chew, an in­fec­tious dis­eases spe­cial­ist, said in an ad­vi­sory pub­lished by Far­rer Park Hospi­tal that while Covid-19 and dengue fever are vi­ral in­fec­tions that present with fever, there are sev­eral fea­tures that dif­fer­en­ti­ate them.</p>
    <p>“Most pa­tients in­fected with Covid-19 would dis­play an up­per res­pi­ra­tory tract in­fec­tion with symp­toms such as sore throat, cough or runny nose. Dengue fever is dif­fer­ent. There would be other symp­toms such as fever, joint aches or pains. Some­times, pa­tients may also de­velop a rash.”</p>
    <p>He added: “When a pa­tient does come in with non-spe­cific symp­toms such as fever, most doc­tors in</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore would be quite wary be­cause th­ese are two com­mon in­fec­tions ac­tive at the mo­ment and a thor­ough check-up is re­quired.”</p>
    <p>Dr Chng said it can be “quite dif­fi­cult” to dif­fer­en­ti­ate dengue and Covid-19. “In gen­eral, muscle aches, fa­tigue, headache, joint pain, nau­sea and vom­it­ing are usu­ally more se­vere in dengue fever. In ad­di­tion, bleed­ing is seen only in dengue fever, but not Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>Dengue can also be present with min­i­mal or no symp­toms at all, es­pe­cially in chil­dren, he added.</p>
    <p>The di­ag­no­sis is usu­ally con­firmed with a blood test and it typ­i­cally takes a few hours for the re­sults to be avail­able.</p>
    <p>There is no spe­cific treatment for dengue, but doc­tors can pro­vide sup­port and ease pain. Most peo­ple can be treated at out­pa­tient clin­ics.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple liv­ing or trav­el­ling in trop­i­cal and sub-trop­i­cal ar­eas are an in­creased risk of ex­po­sure to dengue fever, said Dr Chng. Th­ese ar­eas in­clude South-east Asia, the Western Pa­cific is­lands, Latin Amer­ica and the Caribbean, where the pri­mary car­rier for dengue fever, the Aedes mos­quito, is widely dis­trib­uted.</p>
    <p>It typ­i­cally breeds in or close to houses, lay­ing eggs in both man­made and nat­u­ral wa­ter con­tain­ers.</p>
