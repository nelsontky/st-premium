    <p>Barely a month into his new job at Tanah Merah Ferry Ter­mi­nal, a Malaysian cleaner had an ar­gu­ment with his su­per­vi­sor, stabbed her with a pair of grass cut­ters, and blud­geoned her as she pleaded for mercy.</p>
    <p>Ah­mad Muin Yaa­cob then stole the gold Madam Mai­mumah Awang, 54, was wear­ing, hid her body in a drain and fled across the Cause­way to Malaysia where he pawned the jewellery, partly to pay for his wed­ding in Ke­lan­tan two weeks later.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Ah­mad Muin, 27, was sen­tenced to 18 strokes of the cane and life im­pris­on­ment.</p>
    <p>In a court­room filled with Madam Mai­mumah’s fam­ily mem­bers, the court heard that dur­ing the al­ter­ca­tion on Nov 24, 2016, he was alone in a store room with her when he at­tacked her, thrust­ing the blades of the grass cut­ters into her chest.</p>
    <p>She fell and pleaded with him not to harm or kill her. She tried to get up but he re­peat­edly hit her head with the grass cut­ters.</p>
    <p>He then pulled her body to a 1.8m drain out­side, re­moved the drain cov­ers, pushed her in and closed the cov­ers.</p>
    <p>After tak­ing her jewellery and phone, he took a taxi to Wood­lands Check­point, where he took a bus to Jo­hor.</p>
    <p>He pawned one of her bracelets for RM1,000 (S$328) in Jo­hor be­fore ar­riv­ing home in Pasir Puteh, Ke­lan­tan, where he pawned two neck­laces and a bracelet for RM7,500.</p>
    <p>He set aside RM6,000 for the dowry and used some money to gam­ble. He later sold the pawn ticket to another pawn­shop for RM1,054 and used part of the pro­ceeds for his wed­ding ex­penses.</p>
    <p>He went ahead with his wed­ding on Dec 9, 2016.</p>
    <p>Nine days later, he was ar­rested by Malaysian po­lice and handed over to the Sin­ga­pore po­lice the next day at Kuala Lumpur In­ter­na­tional Air­port.</p>
    <p>He was ar­rested upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore later that day.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Ah­mad Muin chose not to tes­tify in his de­fence.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Aedit Abdullah con­victed him of a re­duced mur­der charge un­der Sec­tion 300(c) of the Pe­nal Code, which car­ries ei­ther life im­pris­on­ment or the death penalty.</p>
    <p>Deputy public prosecutor­s Ku­mare­san Go­hu­la­balan and Se­lene Yap ar­gued that Ah­mad Muin should face 24 strokes of the cane owing to the ag­gra­vat­ing fac­tors of the “ex­tent of the bru­tal­ity”, the lack of re­morse and the de­lib­er­ate step to con­ceal the body.</p>
    <p>How­ever, his lawyers Jo­hannes Hadi and Eu­gene Thu­raisingam ar­gued for 12 strokes, cit­ing the lack of pre­med­i­ta­tion in the at­tack, and that it was pro­voked by a brief ar­gu­ment in which Madam Mai­mumah called Ah­mad Muin’s fam­ily “bodoh” (Malay for “stupid”).</p>
    <p>The court heard in mit­i­ga­tion that Ah­mad Muin is the sev­enth of 11 chil­dren born in a kam­pung. He was of­fered the clean­ing job at the ferry ter­mi­nal in Oc­to­ber 2016 and, barely a month into the job, he was told to leave in or­der for his em­ployer to cut costs.</p>
    <p>Mr Hadi also told the court that Ah­mad Muin’s wife has since di­vorced him.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Straits Times after the court pro­ceed­ings, one of Madam Mai­mumah’s three daugh­ters, Ms Su­mi­nah Sukardi, 35, who works as an ad­min­is­tra­tor in a trans­port com­pany, said the ini­tial stage of los­ing their mother was very tough on the fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Her sis­ter Norhay­ati Sukardi, 34, an ad­min­is­tra­tor in a cake shop, said that while she was ex­pect­ing a slightly harsher pun­ish­ment, she is all right with the out­come.</p>
    <p>She said: “My mum is al­ready rest­ing in peace what­ever the sen­tence is. She can­not come back to life.”</p>
