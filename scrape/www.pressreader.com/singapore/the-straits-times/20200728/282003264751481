    <p>Lawyer Sa­muel Seow Theng Beng prod­ded the fore­head of one of his sub­or­di­nates twice with his fin­ger, caus­ing her pain, in an in­ci­dent that took place at his law firm in 2018. At the time, he was upset with her over work she had not com­pleted.</p>
    <p>Min­utes later and still an­gry, he as­saulted a sec­ond woman – a lawyer work­ing at the firm – af­ter she failed to in­form him of the where­abouts of the com­pany’s as­so­ciate direc­tor.</p>
    <p>A district court heard that he slapped Ms Brenda Kong Shin Ying, who is also his niece, on both her cheeks and the top of her head.</p>
    <p>Seow pleaded guilty in court yes­ter­day to one count each of as­sault­ing Ms Kong, 26, and us­ing crim­i­nal force on Ms Rachel Kang Pei Shan, 21.</p>
    <p>The court heard that the 47-yearold Sin­ga­porean owned com­pa­nies in­clud­ing Sa­muel Seow Law Cor­po­ra­tion and talent agency Beam Artistes.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor (DPP) Ku­mare­san Go­hu­la­balan said Ms Kang worked as an artiste and events ex­ec­u­tive at Beam Artistes.</p>
    <p>She was at the law firm’s of­fice in</p>
    <p>South Bridge Road on April 17, 2018, and was about to leave for a com­pany event when Seow rep­ri­manded her at 5.47pm.</p>
    <p>He then prod­ded her fore­head twice be­fore push­ing a file she was hold­ing, caus­ing her to stag­ger back­wards.</p>
    <p>Three min­utes later, Seow asked aloud for the where­abouts of the firm’s as­so­ciate direc­tor. The court was told that Ms Kong heard what Seow had said, but did not re­spond.</p>
    <p>He later spot­ted her and re­peated his ques­tion. She replied that the as­so­ciate direc­tor had a meet­ing from 4pm to 5pm that day, but did not know where he went to af­ter that.</p>
    <p>Seow then walked to­wards his niece and re­peat­edly asked her why she did not re­ply to his ear­lier queries.</p>
    <p>DPP Ku­mare­san said: “The ac­cused came close to Brenda’s face and Brenda raised her arm across her chest to pro­tect her­self, fear­ing that the ac­cused may get vi­o­lent. In do­ing so, Brenda ac­ci­den­tally touched the ac­cused’s chest.”</p>
    <p>In­censed, Seow as­saulted Ms Kong. A male col­league stepped in and sep­a­rated the pair. Ms Kong man­aged to slip away soon af­ter.</p>
    <p>On May 12 that year, Ms Kang lodged a po­lice re­port.</p>
    <p>The case has been ad­journed to a hear­ing to as­sess if Seow had ad­just­ment dis­or­der be­fore, dur­ing or af­ter he com­mit­ted the of­fences.</p>
    <p>The pre-trial con­fer­ence will be held on Aug 13.</p>
