    <p>• Ger­man Health Min­is­ter Jens Spahn is con­sid­er­ing a run to take over from Dr An­gela Merkel as chan­cel­lor, as com­pe­ti­tion to suc­ceed her after Septem­ber’s elec­tion heats up.</p>
    <p>Mr Spahn, whose stand­ing among vot­ers has risen dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, has been sound­ing out party col­leagues to gauge sup­port for a bid to be the con­ser­va­tive chan­cel­lor can­di­date, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the plan who asked not to be iden­ti­fied. Mr Spahn’s gam­bit was re­ported ear­lier on Fri­day by Der Spiegel magazine and Bild news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>The 40-year-old has long been con­sid­ered a ris­ing star in Dr Merkel’s Chris­tian Demo­cratic Union/Chris­tian So­cial Union (CDU/CSU) bloc, and one poll last month showed he had moved ahead of her to be­come the na­tion’s most pop­u­lar politi­cian. A pro­tege of for­mer fi­nance min­is­ter Wolfgang Schaeu­ble, Mr Spahn made a name for him­self with at­tacks on Dr Merkel over her han­dling of the euro cri­sis and her mi­grant pol­icy. He put his hat in the ring in 2018 as a can­di­date for CDU leader, and although he came in third, his run was well re­ceived by the party and the me­dia.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a Kan­tar poll in Bild last month, 52 per cent of those sur­veyed said Mr Spahn should play a ma­jor role in Ger­man pol­i­tics this year, up from 28 per cent at the end of 2019. Dr Merkel’s ap­proval rat­ing was 51 per cent, up 11 per­cent­age points from the pre­vi­ous year.</p>
    <p>Since then, how­ever, criticism has swirled around the start of Ger­many’s Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme, putting Mr Spahn un­der pres­sure. Dr Merkel was drawn into the con­tro­versy after a June let­ter from Mr Spahn was leaked to Bild. The mes­sage to the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion in­di­cated that the Ger­man leader was be­hind the strat­egy to hand off vac­cine pro­cure­ment to the bloc.</p>
    <p>The fall­out could hurt his chances. An in­frat­est dimap poll for ARD tele­vi­sion pub­lished on Thurs­day showed his ap­proval rat­ing had dropped by eight points to 56 per cent, the low­est since May last year, though he held on to sec­ond place be­hind Dr Merkel on 72 per cent.</p>
    <p>The Chan­cel­lor will step down fol­low­ing the next elec­tion in Septem­ber after 16 years in power. The CDU will elect a new leader – who will have a strong say in the chan­cel­lor can­di­dacy – at a vir­tual congress next week in a tight three-way race.</p>
    <p>Mr Spahn has backed Mr Ar­min Laschet to be­come CDU chief, but the premier of the state of North Rhine-West­phalia has mounted an un­con­vinc­ing cam­paign. Mr Friedrich Merz, a long-time Merkel ri­val, and Dr Nor­bert Roettgen, a for­mer en­vi­ron­ment min­is­ter, are also running.</p>
    <p>The win­ner could step aside to al­low Mr Spahn to run as chan­cel­lor if he is seen as hav­ing the best chance of win­ning the elec­tion. Bavar­ian Premier Markus Soeder from the CSU sis­ter party is also a lead­ing con­tender to be­come the con­ser­va­tive chan­cel­lor can­di­date.</p>
    <p>Mr Laschet – who has sig­nalled he may be will­ing to cede the can­di­dacy to some­one else with stronger chances – said on Fri­day he did not think Mr Spahn’s han­dling of the vac­cine pro­gramme would af­fect his own bid for the CDU chair­man­ship. “In the cri­sis, it gets bumpy some­times – there are problems, the vac­cine doesn’t come as quick as you think or what­ever. He’s do­ing a good job.”</p>
