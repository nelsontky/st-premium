    <p>When Amanda Heng moved into Telok Ku­rau Stu­dios in the late 1990s, she was asked to sign an agree­ment not to do per­for­mances in her stu­dio.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Arts Coun­cil, which was sub­si­dis­ing her rent, had with­drawn fund­ing sup­port for per­for­mance art in Sin­ga­pore – the fall­out from Brother Cane, in which Josef Ng bared his but­tocks and trimmed his pu­bic hair in a 1994 per­for­mance to protest me­dia cov­er­age of an anti-gay op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Heng had pre­vi­ously pre­sented per­for­mance pieces such as Let’s Chat (1996) – first shown at The Sub­sta­tion – where she in­vited peo­ple to pull out a chair and pre­pare bean sprouts with her.</p>
    <p>Frus­trated by the re­stric­tions on per­for­mance art, Heng re­sponded with what she calls “self-help”.</p>
    <p>“I thought, okay, if I can’t do per­for­mance here, then I’ll bring it onto the street. If any­one can bring his or her pet walk­ing around in the streets with­out a li­cence, why can’t I walk my ‘pet’ – my stu­dio stool?”</p>
    <p>So she tied a leash to her stool and pulled it around the city. Thus, Walk­ing The Stool (1999), her first per­for­mance piece draw­ing on the act of walk­ing, was born.</p>
    <p>“It was after that walk that I learnt per­for­mance does not nec­es­sar­ily have to hap­pen in an art space,” says Heng, 69, adding that the whole world be­came her can­vas or “mov­ing stage”.</p>
    <p>Later that year, she staged Let’s Walk, an on­go­ing se­ries where she and mem­bers of the public tread bare­foot and back­wards, hold­ing a mir­ror in hand and a high heel in the mouth. It ini­tially be­gan as a state­ment on women’s progress in con­tem­po­rary so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>But her walks have, over the years, served as a way of ex­plor­ing other topics.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, who is mis­us­ing or abus­ing public space? Does the public space only be­long to peo­ple with cars? And there’s the much de­bated is­sue of the cy­clist and pedes­trian – who has the right to these dif­fer­ent public spa­ces? Who makes the de­ci­sions?”</p>
    <p>Heng, who was awarded the Cul­tural Medal­lion in 2010, says that Let’s Walk “opened up ideas of en­gag­ing with ev­ery­day peo­ple, rather than the ‘art au­di­ence’”.</p>
    <p>“This be­came very im­por­tant for me – to deal with the stigma of per­for­mance art and how it can be pre­sented in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“Walk­ing is a very com­mon ges­ture. The chal­lenge is – how can this ges­ture be trans­formed into art?,” adds Heng, who also con­sid­ers Indian po­lit­i­cal leader Ma­hatma Gandhi, who “mo­bilised crowds of peo­ple with his ideals”, to be an artist.</p>
    <p>Live per­for­mances are shaped by the au­di­ence’s re­sponses.</p>
    <p>When she walked her stool around the city, well-mean­ing passers-by thought she had just vis­ited Ikea and told her she could get her fur­ni­ture home-de­liv­ered next time.</p>
    <p>Over the years, walk­ing has opened up dif­fer­ent av­enues of thought for Heng. She has be­come more con­scious of the age­ing body.</p>
    <p>“This body is an i mpor­tant ma­te­rial for per­for­mance. And it is not a fixed ob­ject or sub­ject. It is a grow­ing, liv­ing thing. That be­comes even more com­pli­cated, interestin­g and chal­leng­ing for me,” says the artist, who also runs tu­to­ri­als for stu­dents from Lasalle Col­lege of the Arts.</p>
    <p>She goes for an hour-long walk at 5am and 5pm ev­ery day, de­scrib­ing this as “an im­por­tant way of keep­ing my­self alive and car­ry­ing on de­spite what­ever dif­fi­cul­ties I have”.</p>
    <p>Walk­ing is a med­i­ta­tive process, she adds. “Be­cause I deal with iden­tity, I need to ad­dress how the ex­ter­nal en­vi­ron­ment has grown and im­pacted my life. I need to ground my­self so I can move for­ward.”</p>
