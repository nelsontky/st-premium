    <p>•</p>
    <p>New Zealand suf­fered its worst eco­nomic slump since the Great De­pres­sion in the sec­ond quar­ter as a strict lock­down to com­bat the coron­avirus brought the coun­try to a stand­still.</p>
    <p>Gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) plunged 12.2 per cent from the first quar­ter, Statis­tics New Zealand said yes­ter­day. That is the big­gest three-month con­trac­tion since quar­terly records be­gan in 1977. Economists had fore­cast a 12.5 per cent de­cline.</p>
    <p>From a year ear­lier, the econ­omy shrank 12.4 per cent, the most recorded in com­pa­ra­ble of­fi­cial data dat­ing back to 1955.</p>
    <p>New Zealand is go­ing through a sharper but shorter eco­nomic shock than it ex­pe­ri­enced dur­ing the de­pres­sion, when GDP fell 5.3 per cent in 1931 and a fur­ther 7.1 per cent in 1932, ac­cord­ing to aca­demic re­search. Nor is the Covid-19 slump as bad as ini­tially feared.</p>
    <p>The South Pa­cific na­tion suc­ceeded in elim­i­nat­ing com­mu­nity spread of the virus, al­low­ing it to emerge early from lock­down, and in­di­ca­tors sug­gest growth surged in the third quar­ter as con­sumers went on a spend­ing spree.</p>
    <p>But the real pain may lie ahead. The bor­der re­mains closed to for­eign­ers, crip­pling the tourism in­dus­try, and the end of the gov­ern­ment’s wage sub­sidy is ex­pected to see un­em­ploy­ment rise.</p>
    <p>The New Zealand dol­lar was lit­tle changed at 67.31 US cents af­ter the re­lease of the data.</p>
    <p>“It’s not the size of the fall that mat­ters, but the size of the re­bound and, like many, we ex­pect to see a strong bounce back in ac­tiv­ity over the third quar­ter,” said Ms Jane Turner, se­nior econ­o­mist at ASB Bank in Auck­land.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s re­port con­firms the first re­ces­sion – de­fined as two con­sec­u­tive quar­ters of eco­nomic de­cline – since 2010. GDP fell a re­vised 1.4 per cent in the first quar­ter of the year.</p>
    <p>The data is un­likely to dent Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern’s chances of win­ning a sec­ond term in the elec­tion on Oct 17. Ms Ardern is rid­ing high in the polls af­ter her deft han­dling of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment’s elim­i­na­tion strat­egy saw it im­pose one of the world’s strictest lock­downs, but al­lowed a quicker re­sump­tion of eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity once the virus was con­tained. New Zealand has recorded 1,451 con­firmed cases of Covid-19 and just 25 deaths.</p>
    <p>The na­tion’s ini­tial seven-week lock­down be­gan in the fi­nal week of March and ended in May.</p>
    <p>While a fresh com­mu­nity out­break in mid-Au­gust led to a sec­ond lock­down in the largest city Auck­land, the coun­try has fared bet­ter than many of its peers which still do not have the virus un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s GDP plunged 20.4 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter from the first and 21.7 per cent from a year ear­lier. The United States econ­omy shrank 9.5 per cent in the quar­ter, a drop that equals an an­nu­alised pace of 32.9 per cent, its sharpest down­turn since at least the 1940s.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s econ­omy shrank less – 7 per cent in the quar­ter and 6.3 per cent in the year.</p>
    <p>The New Zealand gov­ern­ment has pledged NZ$62 bil­lion (S$57 bil­lion) of fis­cal sup­port to help re­vive do­mes­tic de­mand and pro­tect jobs, while the cen­tral bank has slashed in­ter­est rates and em­barked on quan­ti­ta­tive eas­ing to drive down bor­row­ing costs. Re­serve Bank of New Zealand pol­i­cy­mak­ers are con­sid­er­ing tak­ing in­ter­est rates neg­a­tive to fur­ther nurse the econ­omy through the down­turn.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond-quar­ter con­trac­tion was driven by ser­vice in­dus­tries, par­tic­u­larly hos­pi­tal­ity and ac­com­mo­da­tion as in­ter­na­tional travel stopped, ac­cord­ing to the statis­tics agency.</p>
    <p>Gross do­mes­tic prod­uct plunged 12.2 per cent from the first quar­ter, Statis­tics New Zealand said yes­ter­day. That is the big­gest three-month con­trac­tion since quar­terly records be­gan in 1977. Economists had fore­cast a 12.5 per cent de­cline.</p>
