    <p>The Hous­ing Board’s deficit climbed to $2.66 bil­lion in the fi­nan­cial year ended March 31, from about $1.98 bil­lion the year be­fore. This is the statu­tory board’s high­est deficit fig­ure so far, and comes on the back of a gross loss on the sale of flats.</p>
    <p>The Hous­ing Board re­sale mar­ket roared to life in the third quar­ter amid a re­ces­sion trig­gered by the Covid-19 pan­demic, with trans­ac­tions surg­ing to a 10-year high and prices grow­ing at the fastest clip in the past eight years.</p>
    <p>In the pri­vate mar­ket, prices con­tin­ued to sur­prise on the up­side, driven by landed homes and a burst of buy­ing in the city fringes and the sub­urbs af­ter the two-month cir­cuit breaker to stem the spread of Covid-19 ended on June 1.</p>
    <p>Data re­leased yes­ter­day showed the Ur­ban Rede­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity’s (URA) pri­vate home price index rose 0.8 per cent in the third quar­ter from the pre­vi­ous three months, un­changed from its flash es­ti­mate.</p>
    <p>De­spite the eco­nomic down­turn, the pri­vate res­i­den­tial mar­ket re­ceived a boost from fis­cal stim­u­lus in­clud­ing job sup­port schemes, record low in­ter­est rates, and a buoy­ant public hous­ing mar­ket that en­abled up­graders to af­ford new pri­vate homes, noted Ms Tri­cia Song, head of re­search for Sin­ga­pore at Col­liers In­ter­na­tional.</p>
    <p>Prices of re­sale HDB flats rose 1.5 per cent quar­ter on quar­ter af­ter edg­ing up 0.3 per cent in the se­cond quar­ter. This is the fastest rate of growth in the past eight years since prices rose 2.5 per cent in the fourth quar­ter of 2012, said ERA Realty’s head of re­search and con­sul­tancy Nicholas Mak.</p>
    <p>Year on year, prices rose 2.3 per cent. They are up 1.8 per cent for the first nine months of this year.</p>
    <p>The HDB re­sale vol­ume is also the high­est in 10 years, since 8,205 flats were sold in the third quar­ter of 2010. There were 7,787 re­sale flats trans­acted in the July to Sep­tem­ber quar­ter this year, a 127.3 per cent surge from 3,426 units in the se­cond quar­ter, when sales fell 40 per cent quar­ter on quar­ter ow­ing to the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Orange Tee & Tie head of re­search and con­sul­tancy Chris­tine Sun said some de­mand came from buy­ers switch­ing to re­sales as many Build-To-Or­der (BTO) launches were heav­ily over­sub­scribed.</p>
    <p>The HDB said around 9,300 BTO flats will be of­fered next month and next Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, in the pri­vate non­landed mar­ket, prices edged up 0.1 per cent in the third quar­ter, fol­low­ing a 0.4 per cent rise in the se­cond quar­ter. This came as both de­vel­oper sales and sec­ondary sales re­bounded strongly post-cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>In the first nine months of this year, de­vel­op­ers man­aged to sell 7,379 new homes, slightly be­low the 7,469 units sold dur­ing the same pe­riod a year ear­lier, noted Mr Ong Teck Hui, se­nior direc­tor of re­search and con­sul­tancy at JLL.</p>
    <p>Pri­vate re­sale vol­umes hit a twoyear high of 3,530 units sold in the third quar­ter, com­pared with 951 units in the se­cond quar­ter, he said.</p>
    <p>But Ms Song warned that pent-up de­mand is start­ing to fiz­zle. This is es­pe­cially af­ter the URA clamped down on some de­vel­op­ers’ prac­tice of reis­su­ing op­tions to pur­chase to the same buyer mul­ti­ple times.</p>
    <p>Based on the caveats as at Thurs­day, 299 new pri­vate homes (ex­clud­ing ex­ec­u­tive con­do­mini­ums, or ECs) were sold in the first 13 days of this month, com­pared with 1,329 pri­vate home sales in the whole of last month, she pointed out.</p>
    <p>In the third quar­ter, de­vel­op­ers sold 3,517 units (ex­clud­ing ECs), up 105 per cent from the 1,713 units taken up in the se­cond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>They launched 3,791 units (ex­clud­ing ECs), com­pared with 1,852 units in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>In the first nine months of the year, Sin­ga­pore­ans ac­counted for some 80 per cent of new homes sold – the high­est pro­por­tion since 2010, said Mr Is­mail Gafoor, chief ex­ec­u­tive of PropNex, cit­ing Realis data.</p>
    <p>For­eign­ers bought 225 units in the third quar­ter, up from 119 in the se­cond quar­ter de­spite travel re­stric­tions, due in part to more for­eign firms set­ting up op­er­a­tions in Sin­ga­pore, said Mr Lee Sze Teck, direc­tor of re­search at Hut­tons Asia.</p>
    <p>The URA said prices of non-landed prop­er­ties in the prime or core cen­tral re­gion fell 3.8 per cent in the third quar­ter, com­pared with a 2.7 per cent fall in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Prices of non-landed prop­er­ties in the city fringe or rest of cen­tral re­gion jumped 2.5 per cent, com­pared with a 1.7 per cent fall in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Prices in the sub­urbs or out­side cen­tral re­gion jumped 1.7 per cent, com­pared with a 0.1 per cent gain in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>De­mand re­mains strong in city fringe and sub­ur­ban projects at the</p>
    <p>The Ur­ban Rede­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity’s pri­vate home price index rose 0.8 per cent in the third quar­ter from the pre­vi­ous three months. Mean­while, prices of re­sale HDB flats rose</p>
    <p>1.5 per cent af­ter edg­ing up 0.3 per cent in the se­cond quar­ter. sweet spot of $1 mil­lion to $1.5 mil­lion per unit, Ms Song said.</p>
    <p>The URA also said prices of landed prop­er­ties jumped 3.7 per cent in the third quar­ter, af­ter re­main­ing un­changed in the se­cond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Un­like prices, rents of pri­vate res­i­den­tial prop­er­ties con­tin­ued to weaken in the third quar­ter. Rents of non-landed prop­er­ties dipped 0.6 per cent in the third quar­ter, eas­ing from a drop of 1.1 per cent in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter due to the pan­demic and ris­ing un­em­ploy­ment among for­eign work­ers, an­a­lysts say.</p>
    <p>De­vel­op­ers did not launch any EC units for sale in the third quar­ter, and sold 164 EC units in the quar­ter. In com­par­i­son, they sold 71 EC units in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>As at the end of the third quar­ter, there was a to­tal sup­ply of 50,369 un­com­pleted pri­vate res­i­den­tial units (ex­clud­ing ECs) in the pipe­line with plan­ning ap­provals, com­pared with 49,090 units in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Of this num­ber, 26,483 units re­mained un­sold as at the end of the third quar­ter, com­pared with the 27,977 units in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
