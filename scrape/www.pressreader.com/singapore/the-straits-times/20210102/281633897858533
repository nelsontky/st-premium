    <p>Malaysia’s de­ci­sion yes­ter­day to can­cel the high-speed rail (HSR) project with Sin­ga­pore was a painful one, say an­a­lysts, but a nec­es­sary move to shore up its do­mes­tic econ­omy against the more im­me­di­ate on­slaught of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The 350km link be­tween Kuala Lumpur and Sin­ga­pore cost­ing an estimated RM60 bil­lion</p>
    <p>(S$19.7 bil­lion) to RM80 bil­lion would have slashed travel times be­tween the coun­tries, ramped up trade and boosted tourism when com­pleted in 2031. Towns sit­u­ated at key stops along the line in Malaysia had been ex­pect­ing to wel­come mil­lions of ring­git in de­vel­op­ment and in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>“The de­ci­sion to ter­mi­nate must have been a painful one, at least on the Malaysian side, given that ex­pe­di­tious trans­port link­age with Sin­ga­pore was viewed as trans­for­ma­tional for the econ­omy. But the slump brought about by the pan­demic makes other do­mes­tic so­cio-eco­nomic pri­or­i­ties more ur­gent, leav­ing Malaysia in no po­si­tion to pro­ceed with the HSR at the mo­ment,” Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of In­ter­na­tional Af­fairs se­nior fel­low Oh Ei Sun told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The project, agreed to in 2013 and signed on in 2016, was tem­po­rar­ily shelved in 2018 by then Prime Min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad, cit­ing the high debt – over RM1 tril­lion – left be­hind by the pre­vi­ous Na­jib Razak ad­min­is­tra­tion, which had ini­tially pur­sued the rail link with Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The dead­line to pro­ceed was shunted fur­ther from last May to last month, as both coun­tries reeled from the coro­n­avirus out­break. But while Sin­ga­pore could dip into its re­serves to weather the down­turn, Malaysia has had to bor­row to fund stim­u­lus pack­ages that are ex­pected to push the fis­cal deficit to 6 per cent last year and 5.4 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>The re­ces­sion caused by shut­downs aimed at curb­ing the spread of the coro­n­avirus is set to see Malaysia’s econ­omy con­tract by 3.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent last year. Kuala Lumpur had hoped to achieve a fis­cal balance by 2023, a goal it has since aban­doned.</p>
    <p>More­over, the sud­den col­lapse of in­ter­na­tional travel dur­ing the pan­demic would have given pol­i­cy­mak­ers pause over in­vest­ing to in­crease such ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>“It’s a set­back to medium-term as­pi­ra­tions of deeper Asean in­te­gra­tion, but also a nod per­haps to the re­al­i­sa­tion that bor­ders can be shut with star­tling speed and, as seen with the avi­a­tion in­dus­try, re­sult in dire cir­cum­stances for such transna­tional links,” said Bar­clays’ re­gional econ­o­mist Brian Tan.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Depart­ment Mustapa Mo­hamed said the project was ter­mi­nated af­ter the two coun­tries failed to agree on changes pro­posed by Malaysia in the light of the global out­break.</p>
    <p>He said “a num­ber of al­ter­na­tives to re­duce the cost” ex­plored since late 2018 had “be­come more ur­gent with the on­set of the Covid-19 pan­demic” that “ad­versely af­fected Malaysia’s fis­cal po­si­tion”.</p>
    <p>“More im­por­tantly, the pro­posed changes to the project struc­ture would have al­lowed us to lever­age the HSR project to ac­cel­er­ate Malaysia’s eco­nomic recovery post the Covid-19 pan­demic, by bring­ing for­ward the start of the con­struc­tion phase by al­most two years. This would have pro­vided a much-needed boost to our con­struc­tion sec­tor and its sup­port­ing ecosys­tem,” said Datuk Seri Mustapa, who is in charge of the Eco­nomic Plan­ning Unit that over­sees mega projects like the HSR.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cial sources told ST that Malaysia’s wish to ac­cel­er­ate the project’s con­struc­tion phase by two years im­plied re­mov­ing the need for in­ter­na­tional ten­ders, and en­sur­ing that the RM60 bil­lion or more it was plough­ing in from public cof­fers would be mostly reaped by lo­cal con­trac­tors.</p>
    <p>Firms from China, Ja­pan and France had shown interest in bid­ding for HSR con­tracts but, should a do­mes­tic ten­der be called, they would likely have to form joint ven­tures with Malaysian part­ners.</p>
    <p>Mr Mustapa had said “a de­tailed study to ex­plore all pos­si­ble op­tions” would now be con­ducted, and ex­plained that “the new project struc­ture” that could not be agreed with Sin­ga­pore would have pro­vided the govern­ment with “the flex­i­bil­ity in fi­nanc­ing op­tions, such as de­ferred pay­ments, public-pri­vate part­ner­ships and the pos­si­bil­ity of ac­cess­ing fi­nanc­ing at favourable rates”. He did not pro­vide fur­ther de­tails.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Malaysian news re­ports have quoted un­named sources as say­ing that the Cabi­net is look­ing at im­ple­ment­ing the HSR with­out Sin­ga­pore’s in­volve­ment and ter­mi­nat­ing the line in Johor, just across the bor­der with Sin­ga­pore. Sources with knowl­edge of the mat­ter have confirmed this op­tion, telling ST that the ex­ist­ing Ex­press Rail Link that con­nects Kuala Lumpur to its in­ter­na­tional air­port in Sepang 57km away could be ex­tended with a po­ten­tial sta­tion at Se­nai Air­port, which serves Johor.</p>
    <p>For­mer prime min­is­ter Na­jib yes­ter­day slammed the de­ci­sion to de­rail the HSR – a mar­quee project of his ad­min­is­tra­tion – say­ing “the dream of join­ing two of the largest economies and cap­i­tals in Asean will not be achieved” and “eco­nomic ben­e­fits for Malaysia from this project will shrink by tril­lions of ring­git”.</p>
    <p>Claim­ing that the estimated tourism spend of Sin­ga­pore­ans in Malaysia was RM25 bil­lion an­nu­ally, Na­jib said “if the HSR can in­crease tourists from Sin­ga­pore by just 50 per cent, the amount spent by Sin­ga­pore­ans could in­crease by RM12.5 bil­lion per year”. This would more than pay back the cost of the project within a decade, he con­cluded.</p>
    <p>The for­mer premier, who has been con­victed of graft re­lat­ing to the 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had scan­dal, also im­plied that can­celling the HSR and in­vest­ing in a do­mes­tic al­ter­na­tive gave the cur­rent govern­ment free rein to award con­struc­tion con­tracts.</p>
    <p>“One of the ben­e­fits for the Malaysian govern­ment is that it can make all pro­cure­ment de­ci­sions to hand con­tracts to any party, com­pared to the JV (joint ven­ture) model pre­vi­ously where all pro­cure­ment and ven­dor se­lec­tion must be eval­u­ated, ex­e­cuted and su­per­vised by both coun­tries,” he said in a Face­book post.</p>
