    <p>Rome may boast its walk­ing tours of cat­a­combs and crypts packed to the rafters with skele­tal re­mains, while Salem, Mas­sachusetts, in the United States is a mag­net for tourists check­ing out its witch tri­als sites.</p>
    <p>Ghoul­ish after-dark tours abroad may not be pos­si­ble dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, but Sin­ga­pore has no short­age of venues where things go bump in the night too.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to home-grown, self-styled ghost­buster Noel Boyd, there are more than 20 haunted places dot­ted around the is­land where he has recorded para­nor­mal ac­tiv­ity since 2011.</p>
    <p>The 41-year-old started putting up Ghost Files Sin­ga­pore videos on YouTube then and cre­ated the pop­u­lar on­line series Ghost Watch with lo­cal film pro­duc­tion com­pany mm2 En­ter­tain­ment. Each episode gar­ners about 300,000 views.</p>
    <p>“Strange things started hap­pen­ing in 2011, when I was film­ing at the former CID (Crim­i­nal In­ves­ti­ga­tion Depart­ment) head­quar­ters in Eu Tong Sen Street,” he re­lates.</p>
    <p>“It was the first time I made con­tact with an ap­pari­tion,” he claims. “It was a dark shadow-like en­tity, but not the kind you can see through as it had an opaque qual­ity.”</p>
    <p>The “para­nor­mal in­ves­ti­ga­tor” also wears other hats – he is a free­lance life coach and con­tent cre­ator for In­ter­net TV pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>In 2015, Mr Boyd re­leased his first pa­per­back on Ama­zon.com ti­tled Ghost Files: Sin­ga­pore, billed as a col­lec­tion of hor­ror sto­ries based on real events “ex­pe­ri­enced by Sin­ga­pore’s very own ghost hunter”. It has sold close to 10,000 copies since 2017.</p>
    <p>As fod­der for his so­cial me­dia fright­fests, Mr Boyd has tra­versed the length and breadth of the is­land to doc­u­ment aban­doned build­ings, ceme­ter­ies and as­sorted hot spots, where “pon­tianaks” (Malay for fe­male vam­pires), poltergeis­ts and demons are said to hang out at, at least ac­cord­ing to decades-old ur­ban le­gends.</p>
    <p>He notes that many be­lieve the spirit world is macabre and fore­bod­ing, but a coun­ter­point i n Chi­nese cul­ture is that spir­its are not to be feared, but to be ap­peased.</p>
    <p>The an­nual tra­di­tion of the Hun­gry Ghost Fes­ti­val has noth­ing to do with the fear fac­tor. It is, in­stead, a time when rev­er­ence for the departed is en­cour­aged. The fes­ti­val, also re­ferred to as the Sev­enth Lu­nar Month, started last Wednes­day and will end on Sept 16 this year.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to feng­shui master Ce­cil Lee of Geo­mancy.Net, it is also a time to de­bunk myths and su­per­sti­tions sur­round­ing the spirit world.</p>
    <p>“The Chi­nese Ghost Month teaches two virtues – giv­ing gen­er­ously and ex­press­ing grat­i­tude,” says Mr Lee, who is in his 60s and who has ad­vised clients on geo­mancy mat­ters since 1996.</p>
    <p>He says the Ghost Month is not meant to scare devo­tees, but to im­part a sense of giv­ing and honour­ing the dead. “Dur­ing this pe­riod, there is re­spect for the departed,” he says. “How­ever, if one is anx­ious about leav­ing the home at night, it is ad­vis­able to go out with a fam­ily mem­ber or a trusted com­pan­ion.”</p>
