    <p>PhD pro­grammes in the United States are in for some big changes.</p>
    <p>Hu­man­i­ties and so­cial sci­ence fields prob­a­bly pro­duce too many PhDs and will need to cut back. But a big ex­pan­sion of gov­ern­ment-funded re­search could pre­vent a sim­i­lar fate from be­falling Stem (sci­ence, tech­nol­ogy, en­gi­neer­ing and math­e­mat­ics) PhDs.</p>
    <p>The over­pro­duc­tion of PhDs has been an is­sue for years in the US, which has a higher rate of doc­tor­ate hold­ers than al­most any other rich coun­try.</p>
    <p>That by it­self isn’t a bad thing; it’s gen­er­ally good to have a more ed­u­cated pop­u­lace, and US re­searchers help keep the coun­try’s knowl­edge in­dus­tries at the fore­front of the global econ­omy.</p>
    <p>PhDs con­trib­ute sub­stan­tially to the univer­sity sys­tem, pro­vid­ing a source of cheap, highly skilled labour for both re­search and un­der­grad­u­ate ed­u­ca­tion. But the prob­lem starts when the PhD stu­dents col­lect their de­gree and go out into the world. The aca­demic jobs they’re ac­cus­tomed to pur­su­ing have been dry­ing up.</p>
    <p>The end of the big 20th cen­tury univer­sity build­ing boom was the first death knell for this pipe­line.</p>
    <p>Since many pro­fes­sor jobs are tenured, there just aren’t many open spots for young schol­ars un­less the coun­try is build­ing more uni­ver­si­ties – which it no longer is.</p>
    <p>Do a quick Google search for trends in any aca­demic field – history, or an­thro­pol­ogy or English – and you’re likely to find scary num­bers show­ing a de­cline in ten­ure-track fac­ulty open­ings.</p>
    <p>An­other rea­son for the job short­age is that col­leges, un­der im­mense pres­sure to cut costs, have been shift­ing away from tenured fac­ulty to­wards lower-paid lec­tur­ers and ad­juncts.</p>
    <p>That pres­sure has been ex­ac­er­bated as un­der­grad­u­ate en­rol­ment has flat­lined. This con­demns many would-be schol­ars to a bleak ex­is­tence of low-wage, con­tin­gent work.</p>
    <p>Like wait­ers hang­ing around Hol­ly­wood hop­ing for their big break, many stick around year af­ter year, for­go­ing health in­sur­ance or liv­ing in shabby apart­ments while their qual­i­fi­ca­tions for jobs out­side academia de­cay.</p>
    <p>But even as that cov­eted pro­fes­sor life drifted fur­ther out of reach, the coun­try kept pro­duc­ing more PhDs: And of course, this was all pre-Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has dealt a grievous blow to higher ed­u­ca­tion, keep­ing stu­dents home and caus­ing some to question whether they’re get­ting value for money at their schools.</p>
    <p>One ob­vi­ous so­lu­tion is that PhDs need to for­sake the un­re­al­is­tic aca­demic dream and go into the pri­vate sec­tor. And that’s a sen­si­ble course. The prob­lem is that stu­dents’ main ca­reer ad­vis­ers are also their doc­toral the­sis ad­vis­ers, who are them­selves aca­demics and there­fore, tend to know only the aca­demic route.</p>
    <p>Even more fun­da­men­tally, many doc­tor­ates are sim­ply not worth it in purely pri­vate-sec­tor terms.</p>
    <p>A history PhD can go into a cor­po­rate per­son­nel depart­ment or mar­ket­ing or con­sult­ing, or launch their own start-up or do a mil­lion other things – but it’s highly ques­tion­able whether they’ll do much bet­ter than they would have if they’d just taken a job straight out of col­lege or ac­quired a mas­ter’s de­gree.</p>
    <p>So while com­puter sci­ence or statis­tics PhDs can prob­a­bly hop up a few rungs on the cor­po­rate lad­der as a re­sult of their de­grees, and en­gi­neer­ing and bi­ol­ogy PhDs can go get a job in a pri­vate lab, doc­tor­ate hold­ers in the hu­man­i­ties and so­cial sciences are of­ten go­ing to be un­der­em­ployed.</p>
    <p>That’s a recipe for so­ci­etal dys­func­tion.</p>
    <p>Many his­to­ri­ans have ad­vanced some ver­sion of the the­sis that dashed ex­pec­ta­tions among elites can lead to so­cial un­rest.</p>
    <p>Most re­cently, his­to­rian Peter Turchin has warned that over­pro­duc­tion of elites is a har­bin­ger of dis­cord in mod­ern Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>There’s ev­i­dence that PhD school, never a par­tic­u­larly fun ex­pe­ri­ence, is be­com­ing in­creas­ingly stress­ful thanks to grow­ing worry about ca­reers.</p>
    <p>A hand­ful of an­gry, down­wardly mo­bile English PhDs aren’t by them­selves enough to over­throw the in­sti­tu­tions of so­ci­ety, but they can make hugely out­sized con­tri­bu­tions to un­rest and dis­cord if they are so in­clined. Re­mem­ber, these are very smart peo­ple who are very good at writ­ing things, and well-schooled in any num­ber of dis­si­dent ideas. Those are the kind of peo­ple who tend to lead rev­o­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>There are two so­lu­tions to the PhD over­pro­duc­tion prob­lem.</p>
    <p>The first is to in­crease the de­mand for PhDs. In the Stem fields, that’s ac­tu­ally pretty easy to do: Sim­ply pour a lot more gov­ern­ment money into re­search. That’s some­thing the US badly needs to do any­way, in or­der to main­tain tech­no­log­i­cal lead­er­ship and push up eco­nomic growth rates.</p>
    <p>The End­less Fron­tier Act, a Bill in­tro­duced by Demo­cratic Sen­a­tor Charles Schumer in May with bi­par­ti­san sup­port, pro­poses spend­ing US$20 billion (S$26.4 billion) a year on re­search and devel­op­ment. If that leg­is­la­tion were to be passed, it would prob­a­bly be suf­fi­cient to mop up any ex­cess PhDs in en­gi­neer­ing, bi­ol­ogy and other Stem fields.</p>
    <p>But for hu­man­i­ties and so­cial sci­ence PhDs, there’s no such quick fix. The gov­ern­ment isn’t go­ing to dole out bil­lions a year boost­ing re­search in non-Stem ar­eas. So the pro­duc­tion of PhDs in these fields sim­ply needs to be re­duced to a level in line with new eco­nomic re­al­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, this is hap­pen­ing, with more than 140 hu­man­i­ties and so­cial sci­ence pro­grammes sus­pend­ing PhD stu­dent ad­mis­sions for this year. This is go­ing to be painful and frus­trat­ing for some young peo­ple who dream of study­ing those sub­jects for a liv­ing.</p>
    <p>But the squeeze on uni­ver­si­ties meant that those dreams al­ways con­tained an el­e­ment of fan­tasy. As with so many other things, Amer­ica is go­ing to have to do the hard work of bring­ing its aca­demic dreams down to earth.</p>
