    <p>BAN­GA­LORE • Leg­endary In­dian singer S. P. Bala­sub­rah­manyam died in a Chen­nai hos­pi­tal yes­ter­day af­ter two months of treat­ment for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The hos­pi­tal said the 74-year-old singer died of car­dio-res­pi­ra­tory ar­rest.</p>
    <p>Mr Bala­sub­rah­manyam, lov­ingly called SPB in In­dia, recorded over 40,000 songs for films in Tamil, Tel­ugu, Kan­nada, Hindi and Malay­alam.</p>
    <p>Min­utes af­ter the news of his death broke, mu­sic com­poser A. R. Rah­man tweeted a single word: “Dev­as­tated”. Later, he shared an au­dio snip­pet of SPB’s soar­ing voice, and wrote: “The voice of vic­tory, love, de­vo­tion and joy!”</p>
    <p>In a 50-year ca­reer, SPB re­mained a promi­nent singer even as newer gen­er­a­tions of mu­sic com­posers emerged. He was of­ten roped in to sing the most pow­er­ful and heroic num­bers i n Tamil su­per­star Ra­jnikanth’s films and was also the singing voice of Bol­ly­wood heart­throb Sal­man Khan.</p>
    <p>Born in Nel­lore in Andhra Pradesh to theatre artists, Mr Bala­sub­rah­manyam started to per­form film and de­vo­tional songs in con­certs at a young age. His first play­back song in a film was in Tel­ugu, his mother tongue.</p>
    <p>He broke into the Tamil film in­dus­try a few years later with a knock­out song in Adi­mai Penn, a movie star­ring megas­tar and for­mer Tamil Nadu chief min­is­ter M. G. Ra­machan­dran.</p>
    <p>SPB was ad­mit­ted into MGM Health­care on Aug 5 af­ter he ex­pe­ri­enced chest con­ges­tion. As pray­ers and wor­ried wishes poured in, he re­leased a video as­sur­ing ev­ery­one that he was get­ting well fast.</p>
    <p>On Sept 5, he tested neg­a­tive for the coro­n­avirus but his health took a turn for the worse on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>He is sur­vived by his wife, daugh­ter Pallavi and son S. P. B. Cha­ran, also a play­back singer and pro­ducer.</p>
