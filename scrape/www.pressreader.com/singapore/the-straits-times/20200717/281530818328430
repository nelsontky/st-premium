    <p>China’s “wolf war­rior” diplo­matic strat­egy has raised the hack­les of other pow­ers, which, one an­a­lyst says, has left China boxed in. A new con­sen­sus seems to be evolv­ing that China’s chal­lenge to the ba­sic norms of the ex­tant global or­der can­not go un­chal­lenged, ac­cord­ing to an­other an­a­lyst.</p>
    <p>From Wash­ing­ton to Lon­don and from New Delhi to Tokyo and Can­berra, it is in­creas­ingly clear that Bei­jing’s ag­gres­sive “wolf war­rior” diplo­matic strat­egy has raised the hack­les of other pow­ers, pro­duc­ing a widen­ing back­lash.</p>
    <p>“Things have shifted dra­mat­i­cally in the re­gion,” US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo told The Straits Times at a State Depart­ment brief­ing on Wed­nes­day, two days af­ter he is­sued a strong state­ment align­ing the United States with China’s ri­val claimants in the South China Sea, in­clud­ing sev­eral Asean coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“I think you’re see­ing coun­tries all through­out Asia, and in­deed in South-east Asia and in the Pa­cific, recog­nis­ing that the United States is pre­pared to do the things nec­es­sary to as­sist them in pro­tect­ing their valid le­gal claims,” Mr Pom­peo said.</p>
    <p>“We will… use the tools that we have avail­able, and we will sup­port coun­tries all across the world who recog­nise that China has vi­o­lated their le­gal ter­ri­to­rial or mar­itime claims,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo’s com­ments came against the back­drop of a num­ber of steps taken by the US as well as sev­eral other coun­tries that were clearly aimed at China.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump signed the Hong Kong Au­ton­omy Act, which au­tho­rises sanc­tions on “for­eign per­sons, en­ti­ties, and fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions that con­trib­ute to China’s ac­tions to re­move au­ton­omy from Hong Kong”. Wash­ing­ton has also an­nounced visa bans on Chi­nese as well as Huawei of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>The United King­dom on Wed­nes­day banned Chi­nese tele­coms com­pany Huawei.</p>
    <p>China also faces new re­solve from In­dia, partly be­cause Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi can­not ap­pear weak in the af­ter­math of the worst bor­der clash be­tween the two coun­tries in decades. France is bring­ing for­ward delivery of Rafale fighter jets to In­dia and, two weeks ago, New Delhi signed a deal worth more than US$2.4 bil­lion (S$3.3 bil­lion) to buy new Rus­sian MiG-29 and Su-30 MKI fighter jets and up­grade oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan, in its de­fence White Pa­per on Wed­nes­day, blasted Chi­nese ter­ri­to­rial claims and vowed to “strengthen its de­fence ca­pa­bil­ity at speeds that are fun­da­men­tally dif­fer­ent from the past”.</p>
    <p>With an eye mainly on China, Aus­tralia is also arm­ing up. Ear­lier this month, Can­berra an­nounced it would al­lo­cate US$270 bil­lion over the next decade – up from US$195 bil­lion planned in 2016 – un­der its 2020 De­fence Strate­gic Up­date and Force Struc­ture Plan.</p>
    <p>In­dia is ex­pected to in­vite Aus­tralia to join its up­com­ing Mal­abar naval ex­er­cise along­side Ja­pan and the US, in what may sig­nal a so­lid­i­fy­ing of the thus far largely in­for­mal Quadri­lat­eral Se­cu­rity Dia­logue – a strate­gic fo­rum in­volv­ing the US, Ja­pan, Aus­tralia and In­dia.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, on June 23, the US Agency for In­ter­na­tional De­vel­op­ment gave al­most US$1 mil­lion to the In­dia-based Cen­tral Ti­betan Ad­min­is­tra­tion (CTA) – in ef­fect the Ti­betan gov­ern­ment in ex­ile, which is not recog­nised by China.</p>
    <p>This was ap­par­ently the first time any fund­ing agency af­fil­i­ated with the US gov­ern­ment has awarded de­vel­op­ment as­sis­tance di­rectly to the CTA.</p>
    <p>“The US is re­ally leav­ing no stones un­turned at this point with China, ev­ery day we see some­thing new,” Ms Yun Sun, se­nior fel­low and di­rec­tor, China Pro­gramme at the Stim­son Cen­tre in Wash­ing­ton, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The world is pre­par­ing to chal­lenge China more frontally than ever be­fore, said Pro­fes­sor Harsh V. Pant, pro­fes­sor of in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions at King’s In­dia In­sti­tute and head of the strate­gic stud­ies pro­gramme at the Ob­server Re­search Foun­da­tion (ORF) in New Delhi.</p>
    <p>“From the West to the East, a new con­sen­sus seems to be evolv­ing that China’s chal­lenge to the ba­sic norms of the ex­tant global or­der can­not go un­chal­lenged as the costs of in­ac­tion might be too high in the fu­ture,” he wrote in a July 9 ar­ti­cle on the ORF web­site.</p>
    <p>“The global land­scape, which till a few months back looked re­mark­ably be­nign for China, has now turned against the Mid­dle King­dom in a man­ner that Chi­nese pol­i­cy­mak­ers can ill af­ford to ig­nore.”</p>
    <p>Ms Yun Sun said China can blame it­self for be­ing boxed in. “The Chi­nese… chose to act or re­act ag­gres­sively to any­one who shows any sign of dis­agree­ment with China, and that put China in a cor­ner, China boxed it­self in,” she said.</p>
    <p>But, judg­ing from con­cil­ia­tory state­ments from Bei­jing this past week, China re­alises this, she added – and now has to find a way out.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Bei­jing con­tin­ues to also blame Wash­ing­ton. “They feel the whole world is against China be­cause of US in­sti­ga­tion. They per­ceive any sign of dis­re­spect, any dis­agree­ments, re­gard­less of the other coun­try’s own na­tional in­ter­est, as a sign of the US stim­u­lat­ing or ag­i­tat­ing that coun­try to act against China,” said Ms Yun Sun.</p>
    <p>Some in China be­lieve they can wait un­til the Nov 3 US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion pro­duces a change of guard in Wash­ing­ton. But that is mis­placed hope; there is bi­par­ti­san con­sen­sus in Wash­ing­ton on push­ing back against Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Cer­tainly the Chi­nese are do­ing “some hard soul-search­ing now”, said Ms Yun Sun. The broad in­ter­na­tional anti-China coali­tion may force Bei­jing to re­think and change course.</p>
    <p>How­ever, an­a­lysts cau­tion that none of the de­vel­op­ments will change the sta­tus quo in the South China Sea. Dr Robert Man­ning, res­i­dent se­nior fel­low at the At­lantic Coun­cil’s Scowcroft Cen­tre for Strat­egy and Se­cu­rity, told The Straits Times that he wor­ries about a “clas­sic sleep­walk­ing into war”, adding: “I see a con­tin­u­ing game of chicken in the South China Sea.”</p>
    <p>RE­LENT­LESS</p>
    <p>The US is re­ally leav­ing no stones un­turned at this point with China, ev­ery day we see some­thing new.</p>
