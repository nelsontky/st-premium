    <p>•</p>
    <p>SEOUL South Korea re­ported 205 new coro­n­avirus cases as at Friday mid­night, ris­ing above 200 daily in­fec­tions for the first time since Septem­ber, ac­cord­ing to the Korea Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion Agency (KDCA).</p>
    <p>Of the cases, 166 were do­mes­ti­cally trans­mit­ted and 39 im­ported, said the agency yes­ter­day. More than 65 per cent of the lo­cally trans­mit­ted cases were from Seoul and Gyeonggi prov­ince, a densely pop­u­lated re­gion near the cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>On Friday, South Korea be­gan im­pos­ing fines on peo­ple who fail to wear masks in pub­lic when it re­ported 191 new coro­n­avirus cases, with daily in­fec­tions con­tin­u­ing to creep higher.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in urged the au­thor­i­ties to raise aware­ness of the spread of the coro­n­avirus, re­in­forc­ing thor­ough su­per­vi­sion of safety guide­lines such as manda­tory mask-wear­ing.</p>
    <p>“As we are at the point where there are in­creased travel and meet­ings, it would be dif­fi­cult to main­tain the cur­rent quar­an­tine stage” of the na­tion’s so­cial-dis­tanc­ing scheme, Mr Moon said in a Face­book post.</p>
    <p>“If we lower our guard and dis­re­gard quar­an­tine mea­sures, our jobs and daily lives would be put at risk and greater dam­age and suf­fer­ing may come,” he added.</p>
    <p>The coun­try is “inch­ing closer” to need­ing to tighten so­cial dis­tanc­ing, as con­firmed cases in­crease sub­stan­tially, se­nior KDCA of­fi­cial Lim Sook-young told a brief­ing.</p>
    <p>Con­firmed daily cases have av­er­aged 122.4 last week, jump­ing from 88.7 the week be­fore and 75.3 in the fourth week of last month, ac­cord­ing to the KDCA.</p>
    <p>Four South Korean soc­cer play­ers and one staff mem­ber tested pos­i­tive for the virus that causes Covid-19, though none showed symp­toms, Yonhap re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The lat­est daily tally takes the coun­try’s to­tal num­ber of in­fec­tions to 28,338 with 492 deaths, said the KDCA.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment is in fi­nal talks with global drug­mak­ers over po­ten­tial vac­cines as it seeks to se­cure sup­plies to cover 60 per cent of its pop­u­la­tion this year.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Ja­pan’s coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion tally rose to a record 1,731 yes­ter­day, hit­ting a new high for a third straight day, pub­lic broad­caster NHK said.</p>
    <p>Tokyo yes­ter­day con­firmed 352 in­fec­tions of the new coro­n­avirus, ex­ceed­ing 300 for a fourth straight day, data from the metropoli­tan gov­ern­ment showed.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga said on Friday the na­tion did not need an­other state of emer­gency to tackle the pandemic.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan is shift­ing to­wards eas­ing re­stric­tions to boost the econ­omy, such as pro­mot­ing do­mes­tic travel, and pre­par­ing for next year’s post­poned Tokyo Olympics.</p>
