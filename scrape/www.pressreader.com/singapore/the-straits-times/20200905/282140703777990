    <p>A post-Covid so­ci­ety should be a warmer and more co­he­sive so­ci­ety... and I hope that this sur­pass­ing of self we’ve seen will con­trib­ute to a more vi­brant and in­de­pen­dent post-Covid so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>De­spite tough times dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, many Sin­ga­pore­ans have sur­passed them­selves, whether in car­ing for oth­ers, show­ing em­pa­thy for front-line work­ers or pick­ing up new skills, said Ms Sim Ann, Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion, and Na­tional De­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>This spirit, she added, should con­tinue even af­ter the pan­demic so that Sin­ga­pore­ans can build a warmer and more co­he­sive so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing in Man­darin dur­ing the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress yes­ter­day, Ms Sim fo­cused on two trends that have emerged dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>First, a greater ap­pre­ci­a­tion among Sin­ga­pore­ans for for­eign work­ers and those work­ing on the front lines. Se­cond, how Sin­ga­pore­ans have taken the op­por­tu­nity to de­velop their tal­ents, such as bak­ing, mask mak­ing and gar­den­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Sim said since the pan­demic struck, many peo­ple have given her masks and hand sani­tiser to pass on to front-line work­ers such as clean­ers, se­cu­rity guards and early child­hood ed­u­ca­tors.</p>
    <p>She added that more peo­ple have also been do­nat­ing money and vol­un­teer­ing their time, in­clud­ing giv­ing up their $600 Sol­i­dar­ity Pay­ments to those who need it more.</p>
    <p>She said: “Covid-19 has led us to be more ap­pre­cia­tive of for­eign work­ers and front-line work­ers, and we want to ex­press our re­spect and grat­i­tude to­wards them.”</p>
    <p>She added that she hoped Sin­ga­pore­ans who have stepped up to help oth­ers dur­ing the pan­demic would con­sider do­ing so in the long run, and con­tinue to do­nate funds and vol­un­teer their time well af­ter the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion is over.</p>
    <p>The care and con­cern shown to­wards vul­ner­a­ble groups, for­eign work­ers and front-line fight­ers should also con­tinue, she added.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Sim: “A post-Covid so­ci­ety should be a warmer and more co­he­sive so­ci­ety... and I hope that this sur­pass­ing of self we’ve seen will con­trib­ute to a more vi­brant and in­de­pen­dent post-Covid so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>As for Sin­ga­pore­ans who have picked up new skills to help them­selves and oth­ers, she said she wished for the trend to con­tinue as well.</p>
    <p>“In a highly com­modi­tised global con­sumer mar­ket, where al­most ev­ery­thing can be bought off the</p>
    <p>MS SIM ANN, Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion, and Na­tional De­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>shelves... the pan­demic has in­di­rectly cre­ated a DIY re­nais­sance of home-based skills like bak­ing and sew­ing,” she said.</p>
    <p>If this re­vival can help peo­ple achieve a more self-re­liant and sus­tain­able life af­ter the pan­demic, and en­cour­age peo­ple to ap­pre­ci­ate and cher­ish the fruits of other peo­ple’s labour, that would be a good thing, she added.</p>
    <p>Ms Sim said the pan­demic has posed a se­ri­ous threat to Sin­ga­pore, but it has also been a huge force of change.</p>
    <p>While the Gov­ern­ment has been mak­ing a push to­wards dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion for some years, the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion has made the use of tech­nol­ogy more per­va­sive.</p>
    <p>Many busi­nesses have moved to on­line plat­forms to re­main com­pet­i­tive and in­tro­duced dig­i­tal pay­ment meth­ods to re­duce con­tact and to stay safe.</p>
    <p>“But while the whole coun­try moves to­wards dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion, the most chal­leng­ing part is how to help the el­derly grasp ba­sic dig­i­tal skills like us­ing a smart­phone,” said Ms Sim.</p>
    <p>The for­ma­tion of the Sin­ga­pore Dig­i­tal Of­fice, re­cruit­ment of dig­i­tal am­bas­sadors and the launch of the Se­niors Go Dig­i­tal move­ment are all part of ef­forts to help se­niors be­come more com­fort­able with tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Ms Sim asked Par­lia­ment to imag­ine a sit­u­a­tion where an el­derly woman equipped with dig­i­tal skills is able to use tech­nol­ogy in her daily life, for in­stance, us­ing PayNow to pay for her gro­ceries.</p>
    <p>“Such a way of life is al­ready the reg­u­lar rou­tine for some dig­i­tally savvy se­niors. With the ef­forts of the Sin­ga­pore Dig­i­tal Of­fice and dig­i­tal am­bas­sadors, I be­lieve more se­nior cit­i­zens can also have a dig­i­talised post-Covid way of life,” she added.</p>
    <p>And there will def­i­nitely come a day when the na­tion will con­quer the Covid-19 virus, but whether life will re­turn to nor­mal is an­other mat­ter al­to­gether, she said.</p>
    <p>“Not be­ing able to go back to the past may be a pity. But we can def­i­nitely grasp the present, and shape the fu­ture,” she added.</p>
