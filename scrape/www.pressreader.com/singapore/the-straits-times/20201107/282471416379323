    <p>Many of us were anx­ious when Covid-19 first hap­pened. We didn’t know how long it would last, and some of us had is­sues back home that we could not at­tend to be­cause of the quar­an­tine. Now things are bet­ter. Our ba­sic needs are taken care of, but know­ing that the au­thor­i­ties are there to hear our prob­lems and of­fer more sup­port is a step fur­ther.</p>
    <p>MR VELUCHAMY MUNIAPPARA­J, a mi­grant worker from In­dia who is also an am­bas­sador for the Mi­grant Work­ers’ Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>A new task force has been set up to boost men­tal health­care and sup­port for mi­grant work­ers in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Called Project Dawn, it will com­prise rep­re­sen­ta­tives from the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM), In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health (IMH), Mi­grant Work­ers’ Cen­tre (MWC) and non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion (NGO) HealthServ­e, as well as gov­ern­ment psy­chol­o­gists.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Man­power Tan See Leng, who pro­vided de­tails of the ini­tia­tive at an event yes­ter­day, ex­plained that the name Dawn is an acro­nym for de­pres­sion (a com­mon men­tal health is­sue), aware­ness, well­ness and nor­mal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The task force will fo­cus on sev­eral key ar­eas, in­clud­ing rais­ing aware­ness of men­tal health is­sues and screen­ing mi­grant work­ers who may have men­tal health prob­lems. It will also step up ef­forts to equip front-line of­fi­cers, dor­mi­tory op­er­a­tors, em­ploy­ers and NGOs with the skills and in­for­ma­tion needed to iden­tify at-risk work­ers early, and chan­nel them to­wards get­ting the right care.</p>
    <p>Other ar­eas of fo­cus will in­clude look­ing out for signs of men­tal and emo­tional dis­tress among mi­grant work­ers, and train­ing para-coun­sel­lors as part of ef­forts to make coun­selling ser­vices avail­able to mi­grant work­ers who need it.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tives will be rolled out over a two-year pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan said mi­grant work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries have faced sig­nif­i­cant anx­i­ety and stress dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, and that it was im­por­tant to care for other as­pects of their well-be­ing, be­yond their phys­i­cal needs.</p>
    <p>HealthServ­e ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Michael Cheah said its coun­selling hot­line re­ceived about 250 calls a week dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod. The calls to HealthServ­e – an NGO that helps pro­vide med­i­cal care and other ser­vices to mi­grant work­ers – have fallen to about 20 calls a week now, he added.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers are still ad­just­ing de­spite the sit­u­a­tion slowly re­turn­ing to nor­mal, he said.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers tend to have poorer men­tal health than the gen­eral pop­u­la­tion, said Dr Jared Ng, a con­sul­tant for emer­gency and cri­sis ser­vices at IMH and MOM’s As­sur­ance, Care and En­gage­ment Group.</p>
    <p>This could be due to a va­ri­ety of stress fac­tors, such as be­ing wor­ried about their loved ones or the stig­ma­ti­sa­tion they face as mi­grants, he added.</p>
    <p>“Mi­grant work­ers also need to ad­just to a new cul­ture, new norms and a new way of life in Sin­ga­pore and these are stres­sors as well,” said Dr Ng.</p>
    <p>Mr Veluchamy Muniappara­j, 35, a mi­grant worker from In­dia who is also an MWC am­bas­sador, said he wel­comed the move to ad­dress men­tal health is­sues among mi­grant work­ers as it would give them greater peace of mind know­ing that their emo­tional needs were be­ing looked out for.</p>
    <p>“Many of us were anx­ious when Covid-19 first hap­pened. We didn’t know how long it would last, and some of us had is­sues back home that we could not at­tend to be­cause of the quar­an­tine,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Now things are bet­ter. Our ba­sic needs are taken care of, but know­ing that the au­thor­i­ties are there to hear our prob­lems and of­fer more sup­port is a step fur­ther.”</p>
    <p>Dr Tan said sup­port­ing work­ers’ me n t a l h e a l t h is a work in progress. He added that MOM will con­tinue to look for ways to col­lab­o­rate with NGOs, whose work the min­istry is “deeply grate­ful for and very ap­pre­cia­tive of”.</p>
    <p>More will be done in the com­ing months to make men­tal health re­sources more cul­tur­ally rel­e­vant for mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Mr Cheah said HealthServ­e is hop­ing to bring on board coun­sel­lors from the home coun­tries of the mi­grant work­ers to help with coun­selling ses­sions.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing some­one who un­der­stands their cul­ture and en­vi­ron­ment is likely to bring more com­fort and re­lief to dis­tressed work­ers, he added.</p>
