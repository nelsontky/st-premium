    <p>In­done­sian artist Prabu Per­dana, 36, has won the UOB South-east Asian Paint­ing of the Year award for an art­work born out of iso­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Draw­ing on the idea of sol­i­dar­ity in soli­tude dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, the work de­picts his stu­dio as a gar­den lit­tered with per­sonal be­long­ings.</p>
    <p>The scene was partly based on Stone Gar­den, a park not far from his home in Ban­dung, West Java.</p>
    <p>“It’s about iso­lat­ing our­selves in or­der to end the pan­demic,” the artist told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>His win was an­nounced yes­ter­day at a vir­tual award cer­e­mony, which was streamed on Face­book and YouTube.</p>
    <p>The com­pe­ti­tion, or­gan­ised by United Over­seas Bank (UOB), is Sin­ga­pore’s long­est-run­ning art con­test and is now in its 39th year.</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat, the guest of honour, said that the theme of this year’s con­test, Sol­i­dar­ity, “res­onates in these dif­fi­cult times”.</p>
    <p>He ac­knowl­edged UOB’s con­tin­ued sup­port for the arts.</p>
    <p>“To re­cover from this cri­sis and bet­ter po­si­tion the arts in a postCovid world, we will need to work closely with all stake­hold­ers, in­clud­ing artists, arts pa­trons and au­di­ences.”</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth will host a se­ries of Emerg­ing Stronger Con­ver­sa­tions for the arts com­mu­nity, he added.</p>
    <p>Prabu re­ceived US$10,000 (S$13,400) for win­ning the re­gional prize, in ad­di­tion to 250 mil­lion ru­piah (S$23,700) for the UOB Paint­ing of the Year (In­done­sia) award.</p>
    <p>The full-time artist, who rents a room in Ban­dung and watched the cer­e­mony in a cafe on a friend’s lap­top, plans to use the prize money to buy his own house, where he might set up a sec­ond stu­dio.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the re­gional prize was in­tro­duced in 2013, artists com­peted only in their re­spec­tive coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The South-east Asian win­ner is se­lected from the na­tional winners of the UOB Paint­ing of the Year con­tests in In­done­sia, Malaysia, Sin­ga­pore and Thai­land.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian artists have long had a strong show­ing and have won the re­gional prize six times.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore artists Zhang Chun­lei, 51, and Emil Ni­code­mus Chew, 22, topped the is­land’s es­tab­lished</p>
    <p>and emerg­ing artist cat­e­gories, win­ning US$25,000 and US$3,000, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Zhang’s oil on can­vas work, Art Stages Pasar 2020, is crowded with</p>
    <p>masked cul­tural icons from the East and West – such as Astro Boy, the Mona Lisa and Spi­der-Man – sit­ting in an open-air din­ing area.</p>
    <p>The free­lance artist, who was</p>
    <p>struck by the sight of an empty mar­ket dur­ing the Covid-19 cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, said in Man­darin: “This has been a dif­fi­cult year, but we need to stay posi</p>
    <p>tive and press on.”</p>
