    <p>The Work­ers’ Party (WP) has changed its po­si­tion on the $1,300 min­i­mum wage it ad­vo­cates for, Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Man­power Zaqy Mo­hamad sug­gested yes­ter­day dur­ing an ex­change in Par­lia­ment with WP MP Ja­mus Lim.</p>
    <p>This prompted As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lim (Sengkang GRC) to clar­ify that his party’s po­si­tion of $1,300 is for monthly min­i­mum take­home wage, not gross in­come, and to as­sert that the WP has been con­sis­tent on its po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>In a par­lia­men­tary ques­tion, Prof Lim had asked for the num­ber of Sin­ga­pore­ans earn­ing $1,300 a month or less on a take-home ba­sis, ex­clud­ing em­ployer and em­ployee Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) con­tri­bu­tions and other in­come de­duc­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Zaqy replied that there are around 30,000 Sin­ga­porean work­ers earn­ing less than that amount per month, after in­clud­ing Work­fare In­come Sup­ple­ment pay­outs and CPF con­tri­bu­tions.</p>
    <p>When Prof Lim pressed for the fig­ures he wanted in a fol­low-up ques­tion, Mr Zaqy said “it would not be mean­ing­ful nor ac­cu­rate to con­sider in­come ac­cord­ing to the pa­ram­e­ters of (Prof Lim’s) query”, given in­ter­na­tional con­ven­tions on how in­come is mea­sured.</p>
    <p>Us­ing gross in­come – which in­cludes CPF con­tri­bu­tions but be­fore tax de­duc­tions – as a bench­mark is aligned with how the In­ter­na­tional Labour Or­gan­i­sa­tion de­fines gross earn­ings, and “is not a pure Sin­ga­pore def­i­ni­tion”, said Mr Zaqy.</p>
    <p>He also noted that coun­tries with a min­i­mum wage sys­tem also stip­u­late that the min­i­mum wage is sub­ject to taxes and so­cial se­cu­rity con­tri­bu­tions.</p>
    <p>Turn­ing the ques­tion around, Mr Zaqy asked Prof Lim to clar­ify the level of min­i­mum wage that the WP stands for.</p>
    <p>Mr Zaqy said that in pre­vi­ous Par­lia­ment de­bates, Prof Lim had said his party was propos­ing a min­i­mum wage of $1,300, but that his cur­rent query sug­gested that the WP is now propos­ing a min­i­mum take-home pay of $1,300.</p>
    <p>“That’s a shift in where the line is – if this is the case, then the gross wage, in­clu­sive of CPF con­tri­bu­tions, should be higher – $1,600, $1,700, there­abouts,” Mr Zaqy said.</p>
    <p>Prof Lim replied that the premise of his ques­tion had noth­ing to do with the min­i­mum wage.</p>
    <p>“The ques­tion did not spec­ify any­thing about the min­i­mum wage... in part, the rea­son why we raised $1,300 was be­cause that was the no­tion of how much a rea­son­able bas­ket of goods and ser­vices for ad­e­quate liv­ing in Sin­ga­pore would en­tail,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Zaqy replied: “Mr Speaker, I think the Mem­ber is evad­ing the ques­tion be­cause I have shown that in the (WP) man­i­festo, it was $1,300 men­tioned. The last few de­bates, too, the same fig­ure was men­tioned but in dif­fer­ent def­i­ni­tions.</p>
    <p>“At the root of the is­sue now is</p>
    <p>THAT SAME $1,300 FIG­URE</p>
    <p>I have shown that in the (WP) man­i­festo, it was $1,300 men­tioned. The last few de­bates, too, the same fig­ure was men­tioned but in dif­fer­ent def­i­ni­tions.</p>
    <p>SE­NIOR MIN­IS­TER OF STATE FOR MAN­POWER ZAQY MO­HAMAD, ask­ing As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ja­mus Lim to clar­ify the level of min­i­mum wage that the Work­ers’ Party stands for.</p>
    <p>Asked once more by Mr Zaqy if the WP’s pro­posed min­i­mum wage line is $1,300 in gross in­come, Prof Lim (above) said this was cor­rect and “a fair char­ac­ter­i­sa­tion”. But he later clar­i­fied that his party’s po­si­tion is for a min­i­mum take-home pay of $1,300 a month for full-time work, and not gross in­come.</p>
    <p>the WP changed its def­i­ni­tion for its min­i­mum wage line.”</p>
    <p>Prof Lim dis­agreed that he was evad­ing the ques­tion, as Mr Zaqy had “im­puted an in­fer­ence” from the $1,300 fig­ure in his ques­tion.</p>
    <p>Asked once more by Mr Zaqy if the WP’s pro­posed min­i­mum wage line is $1,300 in gross in­come, Prof Lim said this was cor­rect and “a fair char­ac­ter­i­sa­tion”. But he later clar­i­fied that his party’s po­si­tion is for a min­i­mum take-home pay of $1,300 a month for full-time work, and not gross in­come.</p>
    <p>This was not the first time the WP has crossed swords with the Gov­ern­ment over the is­sue.</p>
    <p>At a Par­lia­ment sit­ting last month, a pro­longed de­bate en­sued be­tween the Na­tional Trades Union Congress’ deputy sec­re­tary­gen­eral Koh Poh Koon and Leader of the Op­po­si­tion Pri­tam Singh.</p>
