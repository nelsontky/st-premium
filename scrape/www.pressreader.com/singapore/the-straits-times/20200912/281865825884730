    <p>TRUMP’S CON­TENTIOUS PHONE CALL WITH TRADE BODY CHIEF</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump threat­ened to with­draw the United States from the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO) dur­ing a con­tentious phone call with the group’s then leader, ac­cord­ing to jour­nal­ist Bob Wood­ward’s new book Rage.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump de­manded that Mr Roberto Azevedo des­ig­nate the US a “de­vel­op­ing na­tion” like China and In­dia in or­der to get more favourable trad­ing terms.</p>
    <p>When Mr Azevedo ob­jected, Mr Trump said: “Here’s what I’m do­ing: I’m pulling out of the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion.”</p>
    <p>Mr Azevedo re­signed from his po­si­tion in May, well be­fore his term was set to end next year, say­ing the group’s work had ground to a halt. The ap­point­ment of judges to the WTO’s ap­peals panel was halted in De­cem­ber af­ter the US blocked all nom­i­na­tions and al­lowed mem­bers’ terms to ex­pire, ham­per­ing the body’s abil­ity to re­solve trade dis­putes.</p>
    <p>The headless body of Mr Kim Jong Un’s ex­e­cuted un­cle was dis­played to se­nior North Korean of­fi­cials, Mr Trump said.</p>
    <p>Jang Song Thaek, the North Korean leader’s un­cle by mar­riage and a hugely pow­er­ful fig­ure within the regime, was purged for trea­son and cor­rup­tion in 2013, in what was widely seen as Mr Kim as­sert­ing his au­thor­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Kim “tells me ev­ery­thing. Told me ev­ery­thing”, Mr Trump told Mr Wood­ward in the book.</p>
    <p>“He killed his un­cle and he put the body right in the steps,” Mr Trump said. “And the head was cut, sit­ting on the chest.”</p>
    <p>North Korea has never of­fi­cially stated how Jang was ex­e­cuted.</p>
    <p>The new book also un­veils let­ters be­tween the two lead­ers, in which Mr Kim de­ployed flat­tery and florid prose in his di­plo­matic courtship of Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>“Even now I can­not for­get that mo­ment of his­tory when I firmly held Your Ex­cel­lency’s hand at the beau­ti­ful and sa­cred lo­ca­tion as the whole world watched with great in­ter­est and hope to re­live the hon­our of that day,” Mr Kim wrote to Mr Trump on Christ­mas</p>
    <p>Day 2018, fol­low­ing their first meeting in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>TRUMP BOASTED OF HELP­ING SAUDI PRINCE IN MUR­DER CASE</p>
    <p>Mr Trump boasted that he saved Saudi Ara­bia’s crown prince from greater scru­tiny over the killing of jour­nal­ist Ja­mal Khashoggi.</p>
    <p>He de­fended Prince Mo­hammed bin Sal­man over the grue­some mur­der in­side a Saudi con­sulate of Mr Khashoggi, a USbased critic of the prince’s rule.</p>
    <p>“I saved his ass. I was able to get Congress to leave him alone. I was able to get them to stop,” Mr Trump said. “He will al­ways say that he didn’t do it. He says that to ev­ery­body, and frankly I’m happy that he says that... He’s never said he did it.”</p>
    <p>Mr Khashoggi’s killing trig­gered an up­roar among US law­mak­ers but the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has stood by Saudi Ara­bia.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump boasted of a po­ten­tially nu­clear weapons sys­tem that “no­body’s ever had”, ap­pear­ing to dis­close top-se­cret de­fence in­for­ma­tion in one of the on-there­cord in­ter­views he gave Mr Wood­ward.</p>
    <p>Such a rev­e­la­tion, if true, could shake up great power politics and in­flame the arms race.</p>
    <p>“I have built a nu­cle-, a weap-, I have built a weapons sys­tem, weapons sys­tem, that no­body’s ever had in this coun­try be­fore,” Mr Trump said.</p>
    <p>“We have stuff that (Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir) Putin and (Chi­nese Pres­i­dent) Xi (Jin­ping) have never heard about be­fore... What we have is in­cred­i­ble.”</p>
    <p>Mr Wood­ward said he had con­firmed sep­a­rately with sources that the US in­deed has a new se­cret weapon, but did not say whether it was nu­clear or not.</p>
