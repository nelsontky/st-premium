    <p>HONG KONG • Petrol bombs were hurled at a Hong Kong po­lice re­cre­ation club in the early hours of yes­ter­day, a rare at­tack on a po­lice fa­cil­ity since Bei­jing i mposed a sweep­ing na­tional se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>Po­lice said they re­ceived a re­port of three men dressed in black hurl­ing Molo­tov cock­tails into the car park of the Po­lice Sports and Re­cre­ation Club in Mongkok, a district that saw many clashes dur­ing last year’s huge democ­racy protests.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal me­dia im­ages showed the front of a truck was burned out but no fur­ther dam­age.</p>
    <p>An 18-year-old man was later ar­rested a short walk away from the club car­ry­ing pep­per spray, po­lice said, although it was not clear if he was a sus­pect.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong was con­vulsed by seven straight months of huge and of­ten vi­o­lent ral­lies last year call­ing for democ­racy and greater po­lice ac­count­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>Riot po­lice fired thou­sands of rounds of tear gas and rub­ber bul­lets at crowds – as well as some live rounds.</p>
    <p>Groups of pro­test­ers re­sorted to rocks and petrol bombs, with po­lice sta­tions of­ten tar­geted.</p>
    <p>Mass ar­rests and the emer­gence of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic damp­ened the protests at the start of this year. Bei­jing then ramped up a crack­down, in­clud­ing the im­po­si­tion of a se­cu­rity law that out­laws calls for greater au­ton­omy or in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>At­tacks on po­lice are now clas­si­fied as ter­ror­ism and are pun­ish­able by sen­tences of 10 years to life in prison.</p>
    <p>The first per­son charged un­der the new law was a man who al­legedly rode a mo­tor­cy­cle into a group of po­lice while fly­ing an in­de­pen­dence flag. He is be­ing pros­e­cuted for two new se­cu­rity crimes: se­ces­sion and ter­ror­ism.</p>
    <p>Most of those ar­rested un­der the new law are be­ing in­ves­ti­gated or pros­e­cuted for things they have said, not vi­o­lent crimes.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing says the law has re­stored sta­bil­ity in the Asian fi­nan­cial cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics, in­clud­ing many Western pow­ers, say it has evis­cer­ated the free­doms and au­ton­omy that China promised Hong Kong could keep af­ter its han­dover from colo­nial ruler Bri­tain in 1997.</p>
