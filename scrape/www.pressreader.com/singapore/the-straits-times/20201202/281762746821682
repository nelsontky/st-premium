    <p>WASHINGTON • US Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence told gov­er­nors on Mon­day that dis­tri­bu­tion of a coro­n­avirus vac­cine could be­gin by the third week of this month, sig­nalling that US reg­u­la­tors will swiftly ap­prove an emer­gency au­tho­ri­sa­tion for the first shots.</p>
    <p>“We strongly be­lieve the vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion process could be­gin the week of Dec 14,” Mr Pence said, ac­cord­ing to a sum­mary of the call pro­vided by the of­fice of Washington Gov­er­nor Jay Inslee. “The Amer­i­can peo­ple de­serve to know the cav­alry is on the way.”</p>
    <p>Mr Pence told the gov­er­nors that they will have the fi­nal say on vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion as the “ul­ti­mate ar­biters” in their states, ac­cord­ing to the sum­mary.</p>
    <p>Biotech firm Moderna on Mon­day re­quested that the Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA) is­sue an emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion for its shot, fol­low­ing in Pfizer’s foot­steps. Both com­pa­nies’ vac­cines are more than 90 per cent ef­fec­tive, ac­cord­ing to pre­lim­i­nary re­sults of clin­i­cal tri­als, though their dis­tri­bu­tion chal­lenges in­clude re­quir­ing two shots.</p>
    <p>Health and Hu­man Ser­vices Sec­re­tary Alex Azar, FDA com­mis­sioner Stephen Hahn, Cen­tres for Disease Con­trol and Preven­tion (CDC) di­rec­tor Robert Red­field and Dr An­thony Fauci, di­rec­tor of the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Al­lergy and In­fec­tious Diseases, also par­tic­i­pated in the call.</p>
    <p>An FDA ad­vi­sory panel is sched­uled to meet on Dec 10 to dis­cuss the vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Mr Azar told the gov­er­nors that dis­tri­bu­tion could be­gin within 24 hours of reg­u­la­tory ap­proval, while Mr Pence said the ad­min­is­tra­tion be­lieves that will be the week of the 14th.</p>
    <p>Vac­cines will be largely ad­min­is­tered by phar­ma­cies such as those owned by CVS Health and Wal­greens Boots Al­liance, Mr Azar said.</p>
    <p>“It was a very happy call,” said Ohio Gov­er­nor Mike DeWine, a Repub­li­can. He said Pfizer’s vac­cine could be­gin ar­riv­ing in his state by Dec 15.</p>
    <p>The call took place against a back­drop of a rag­ing pan­demic.</p>
    <p>US coro­n­avirus cases surged in the days be­fore the Thanks­giv­ing week­end, in­clud­ing a record 205,000 cases recorded last Fri­day. The US recorded nearly four mil­lion cases last month alone, out of 13.5 mil­lion so far.</p>
    <p>Deaths have been trending up and hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions are at a record level.</p>
    <p>“Our health­care sys­tem is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a real chal­lenge,” Mr Azar ac­knowl­edged on the call.</p>
    <p>Some gov­er­nors on the call ex­pressed sur­prise to learn that vac­cines would be dis­trib­uted to states at first based on a per capita for­mula, count­ing only those aged 18 and older.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the call, Min­nesota Gov­er­nor Tim Walz said the ad­min­is­tra­tion is un­de­cided on who should be vac­ci­nated first.</p>
    <p>“The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion be­lieves you vac­ci­nate those 65 and older,” Mr Walz told re­porters. “The CDC, Dr Fauci, and oth­ers say you vac­ci­nate the health­care work­ers to get the big­gest bang for the buck. Those are dis­cus­sions that are hap­pen­ing right now.”</p>
    <p>Mr Pence as­sured the gov­er­nors that the ad­min­is­tra­tion would sup­port any dis­tri­bu­tion plan they choose. His of­fice re­leased a sum­mary of the call, not­ing that Mr Hahn in­sisted that the vac­cine pro­gramme “leads to no cut cor­ners”.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Cal­i­for­nia Gov­er­nor Gavin New­som said on Mon­day the state was at a “tip­ping point” in the Covid-19 pan­demic, which would soon over­whelm hos­pi­tals as po­lit­i­cal lead­ers na­tion­wide turn to in­creas­ingly ag­gres­sive mea­sures to hold back the lat­est surge.</p>
    <p>He said he may clamp new “stayat-home” or­ders on Cal­i­for­nia’s roughly 40 mil­lion res­i­dents in the face of in­fec­tions and hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions that are still ris­ing weeks be­fore emer­gency vac­cines are pre­dicted for re­lease.</p>
    <p>“(Cal­i­for­nia) has worked hard to pre­pare for a surge – but we can’t sus­tain the record high cases we’re see­ing,” Mr New­som said on Twit­ter. “Cur­rent pro­jec­tions show Cal­i­for­nia will run out of cur­rent ICU (in­ten­sive care unit) beds be­fore Christ­mas Eve.”</p>
    <p>The gov­er­nor told re­porters that dis­cus­sions were un­der way among state health of­fi­cials over the po­ten­tial stay-at-home or­der. He ex­pects to is­sue a de­ci­sion in the next day or two.</p>
    <p>Last week, he or­dered a daily cur­few bar­ring so­cial gath­er­ings and other non-es­sen­tial ac­tiv­i­ties across most of the state be­tween 10pm and 5am daily.</p>
