    <p>• In­done­sia must use the pan­demic to re­boot South-east Asia’s big­gest econ­omy, in­clud­ing by im­prov­ing food and en­ergy se­cu­rity, as well as pro­cess­ing more nat­u­ral re­sources at home, Pres­i­dent Joko Widodo said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Joko made the re­marks in his an­nual state of the union speech to Par­lia­ment. Ow­ing to coron­avirus pre­cau­tions, fewer than half of the law­mak­ers were present for his ad­dress, with the rest watch­ing on­line.</p>
    <p>The na­tion is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing its worst cri­sis in more than two decades as re­stric­tions on move­ment to fight the pan­demic and a plunge in global de­mand have wreaked havoc on house­holds and busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Liken­ing the cur­rent eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion to “a com­puter crash” caus­ing stag­na­tion, he said In­done­sia, along with other coun­tries, must “shut down, restart and re­boot”.</p>
    <p>“We must not let the cri­sis bring about set­backs. In fact, we must cap­i­talise on the cri­sis as a mo­men­tum to make a big leap,” said Mr Joko, who was wear­ing a tra­di­tional out­fit from the Sabu peo­ple in the east­ern part of the ar­chi­pel­ago.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment ex­pects the econ­omy to post near flat growth this year be­cause of the pan­demic, which has in­fected more than 135,000 peo­ple in the coun­try and caused over 6,000 deaths, the high­est death toll in South-east Asia. Last year, the econ­omy grew by 5 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mr Joko said ac­cel­er­at­ing re­form of the health sec­tor was a top pri­or­ity, along with strength­en­ing food sup­ply chains, in­clud­ing with a newly planned food es­tate on Bor­neo is­land.</p>
    <p>Un­der en­ergy re­forms, Mr Joko high­lighted plans to slash ex­pen­sive oil im­ports by us­ing fuel made from palm oil.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia’s Per­tam­ina pro­duced a first batch of biodiesel made fully from palm oil last month and is set to pro­duce 1,000 bar­rels of the fuel at its Du­mai re­fin­ery.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia cur­rently has a manda­tory use of biodiesel with 30 per cent palm oil con­tent.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent also stressed a need to push for­ward the down­stream pro­cess­ing of raw ma­te­ri­als, in­clud­ing con­vert­ing coal into gas and nickel ore into ferro nickel and stain­less steel, as part of gov­ern­ment ef­forts to cre­ate jobs.</p>
    <p>Later yes­ter­day, the Pres­i­dent pro­posed to Par­lia­ment a 2,747.5 tril­lion ru­piah (S$253.8 bil­lion) bud­get for next year and pledged to con­tinue ef­forts to sup­port the econ­omy amid un­cer­tain­ties sur­round­ing the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The bud­get pro­posal, which rep­re­sents only a 0.3 per cent in­crease com­pared with this year’s spend­ing plans, as­sumed growth in South­east Asia’s largest econ­omy will re­bound to 4.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent next year.</p>
    <p>The pro­posal as­sumes a bud­get deficit of 5.5 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct, smaller than the 6.34 per cent ex­pected this year.</p>
    <p>“The 2021 state bud­get bill is de­signed to ac­cel­er­ate eco­nomic re­cov­ery na­tion­wide amid the Covid-19 pan­demic,” Mr Joko said in his bud­get speech to Par­lia­ment, ahead of the coun­try’s in­de­pen­dence cel­e­bra­tions on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>With gov­ern­ment rev­enue falling, the Pres­i­dent has turned to the cen­tral bank to share the bur­den, and said he in­tends to do so again next year.</p>
    <p>United Over­seas Bank’s Jakartabas­ed econ­o­mist En­rico Tanuwid­jaja said: “The gov­ern­ment is com­mit­ted to de­liv­er­ing pos­i­tive growth in 2021 and be­yond by fis­cal stim­u­lus, and such counter-cycli­cal fis­cal strat­egy is in­deed ap­pro­pri­ate.”</p>
    <p>But the ru­piah could weaken fur­ther. “As In­done­sia will fi­nance its 2021 deficit with cen­tral bank co­op­er­a­tion, it will un­der­mine the ru­piah on con­cerns over more debt mon­eti­sa­tion,” said Asia FX strate­gist Gao Qi of Sco­tia­bank in Sin­ga­pore. “The ru­piah is likely to test 15,000 (to the US dol­lar) in the next few weeks.”</p>
