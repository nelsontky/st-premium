    <p>Bri­tain yes­ter­day gave emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion to the Covid-19 vac­cine by Pfizer and BioNTech, be­com­ing the first Western coun­try to pave the way for mass in­oc­u­la­tions against a dis­ease that has killed more than 1.4 mil­lion world­wide.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is also in dis­cus­sions with the firms to se­cure a sup­ply of the vac­cine doses here, said BioNTech’s chief busi­ness and chief com­mer­cial of­fi­cer Sean Marett dur­ing a vir­tual press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish gov­ern­ment said yes­ter­day it had ac­cepted the rec­om­men­da­tion from the in­de­pen­dent Medicines and Health­care prod­ucts Reg­u­la­tory Agency to ap­prove Pfizer-BioNTech’s Covid-19 vac­cine for use and that it will be rolled out from next week.</p>
    <p>Dr Ugur Sahin, chief ex­ec­u­tive and co-founder of BioNTech, noted that the emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion in Bri­tain will mark the first time that cit­i­zens out­side of the tri­als will have the op­por­tu­nity to be im­mu­nised against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Un­til yes­ter­day, no coun­try had au­tho­rised a fully tested coro­n­avirus vac­cine. Rus­sia and China ap­proved vac­cines with­out wait­ing for large-scale ef­fi­cacy tests.</p>
    <p>Pfizer chair and CEO Al­bert Bourla said: “As we an­tic­i­pate fur­ther au­tho­ri­sa­tions and ap­provals, we are fo­cused on mov­ing with the same level of ur­gency to safely sup­ply a high-qual­ity vac­cine around the world.</p>
    <p>“With thou­sands of peo­ple be­com­ing in­fected, ev­ery day mat­ters in the col­lec­tive race to end this dev­as­tat­ing pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Bri­tain said it would start vac­ci­nat­ing early next week those most at risk of dy­ing, af­ter it gets 800,000 doses from Pfizer’s man­u­fac­tur­ing cen­tre in Bel­gium.</p>
    <p>Both the United States and the Euro­pean Medicines Agency are likely to make a de­ci­sion on emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion for the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine this month.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, with­out giv­ing de­tails, Mr Marett said: “In Sin­ga­pore, we have a sup­ply agree­ment un­der dis­cus­sion.”</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong had said last month that Sin­ga­pore was in talks over this is­sue.</p>
    <p>This would add to the Repub­lic’s Covid-19 vac­cine port­fo­lio, with the au­thor­i­ties here al­ready re­view­ing another front run­ner by Moderna.</p>
    <p>The Health Sci­ences Au­thor­ity (HSA) said it has started eval­u­at­ing the avail­able data sub­mit­ted by Moderna, which wants the au­thor­i­ties to ap­prove the use of its Covid-19 vac­cine in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>When queried, an HSA spokesman de­clined to say if other firms had ap­proached it to ap­prove the use of other Covid-19 vac­cines here, cit­ing pro­pri­etary rea­sons.</p>
    <p>Both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vac­cines – which lever­age a new tech­nol­ogy called mes­sen­ger RNA – ap­pear highly ef­fec­tive in pre­vent­ing in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Pfizer said fi­nal re­sults from the late-stage trial showed that its vac­cine was 95 per cent ef­fec­tive, while Moderna said its tri­als have shown a 94.1 per cent ef­fi­cacy.</p>
    <p>How­ever, while the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine needs to be stored at mi­nus 70 deg C, the Moderna one can tol­er­ate much warmer stor­age – at mi­nus 20 deg C, which is stan­dard for most hospi­tal and phar­macy freez­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Marett said yes­ter­day the devel­op­ment of a vac­cine was not a com­pe­ti­tion be­tween com­pa­nies. “We see us col­lec­tively pro­vid­ing a so­lu­tion to end this pan­demic so we can all get back to nor­mal life again. And that’s the most im­por­tant thing to fo­cus on,” he added.</p>
