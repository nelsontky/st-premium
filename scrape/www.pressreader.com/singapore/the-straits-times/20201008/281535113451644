    <p>Mi­ami Heat will have to stop ri­vals Los An­ge­les Lak­ers from clinch­ing the lead af­ter three quar­ters if they are to have any chance of claw­ing back from a 3-1 deficit in the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) Fi­nals to­mor­row. Led by LeBron James, the Lak­ers are one win away from a 17th NBA crown af­ter a 102-96 Game 4 win on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>If the Mi­ami Heat were to have any chance of claw­ing back from a 3-1 deficit in the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) Fi­nals to­mor­row, they must first stop the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers from tak­ing the lead af­ter three quar­ters.</p>
    <p>LeBron James and the Lak­ers main­tained their re­mark­able fourth-quar­ter win­ning streak as they se­cured a 102-96 Game 4 vic­tory on Tues­day that left them on the brink of a 17th NBA crown.</p>
    <p>Los An­ge­les took a com­mand­ing lead in the best-of-seven se­ries in Or­lando, with the re­sult also ex­tend­ing their record of re­main­ing un­beaten this sea­son when­ever they have led go­ing into the fourth quar­ter. The team are 56-0 when tak­ing a lead into the fourth.</p>
    <p>“I think the fourth quar­ter, ob­vi­ously it’s win­ning time,” Lak­ers star James said of the game in which he team took a 75-70 lead af­ter three pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>“You’ve got 12 minutes to buckle down de­fen­sively with the lead, kind of hold that lead, and then you have to ex­e­cute of­fen­sively.</p>
    <p>“That’s the mind­set for us. We’ve got 12 minutes. If we have the lead, it’s our job to outscore the op­po­nent or to hold them to (as many) points as us, which is the same ex­act thing, be­cause if we win the quar­ter, we win the game. That’s kind of been our mind­set all year long.”</p>
    <p>James, who will win a fourth cham­pi­onship ring if the Lak­ers win one of the re­main­ing three games in the se­ries, is al­ready look­ing for­ward to Game 5 to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>“I get so ex­cited – like right now, I’m ex­cited about our meet­ing to­mor­row watch­ing film and break­ing that down and see­ing things that we can do bet­ter,” he said.</p>
    <p>“See­ing things that we did do well. Think­ing about the ad­just­ments that they pos­si­bly will do... that’s the best part about it. It’s a chess match.”</p>
    <p>While James led the scor­ing for the Lak­ers on 28 points, the team’s win came off of a Her­culean de­fen­sive ef­fort from An­thony Davis (22 points), who shut down Mi­ami dan­ger man Jimmy But­ler.</p>
    <p>But­ler, the 40-point hero of Mi­ami’s win on Sun­day, was re­stricted to 22 points, frus­trated through­out by Davis.</p>
    <p>“Jimmy is so great, it’s hard to even slow him down but AD did a great job,” Lak­ers coach Frank Vo­gel said. “It starts there but you have to credit our guys’ com­pet­i­tive spirit. They were fly­ing around and just com­pet­ing at an ex­tremely high level that end of the floor.”</p>
    <p>He added that he had not needed to mo­ti­vate Davis af­ter a dis­ap­point­ing out­ing in Sun­day’s Game 3 de­feat.</p>
    <p>“You don’t have to say any­thing to An­thony Davis,” Vo­gel said. “He wants this more than any­thing. Ob­vi­ously he’s a great player ca­pa­ble of im­pos­ing his will on the game on both ends of the floor.”</p>
    <p>Tyler Herro scored 21 points for the Heat and Dun­can Robin­son had 17.</p>
    <p>Bam Ade­bayo re­turned from two games missed with a neck in­jury to score 15 while Go­ran Dragic (foot) re­mained side­lined.</p>
    <p>De­spite the de­feat, Heat coach Erik Spoel­stra backed his team to bounce back to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Only once be­fore in NBA Fi­nals his­tory has a team over­turned a 3-1 deficit, when a James-in­spired Cleve­land Cava­liers stunned the Golden State War­riors in 2016.</p>
    <p>But Spoel­stra struck a de­fi­ant stance, say­ing: “Our guys love com­pe­ti­tion and love the chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>“We are here for a pur­pose. We never ex­pected this to be easy. We’ll just rest and re­cover to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>“Re­cal­i­brate, get back to work on Thurs­day. I know our group’s go­ing to be ready. We’ll re­spond, that’s aca­demic at this point. We’ll just rest up and get ready for the next one.”</p>
