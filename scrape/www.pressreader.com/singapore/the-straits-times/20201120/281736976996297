    <p>A 68-year-old Sin­ga­porean man, who was an­nounced yesterday as a new im­ported coro­n­avirus case, is be­ing in­ves­ti­gated for not declar­ing he had symp­toms.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health (MOH) said in a state­ment yesterday that in­ves­ti­ga­tions are be­ing done to as­sess if there has been any breach of travel re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>The man had trav­elled from In­done­sia and had been hav­ing short­ness of breath since Nov 11.</p>
    <p>But on Tues­day, he said in his health dec­la­ra­tion form for im­mi­gra­tion clear­ance that he did not have any symp­toms.</p>
    <p>“We urge ev­ery­one to con­tinue to ex­er­cise social re­spon­si­bil­ity and will not hes­i­tate to take en­force­ment ac­tions against those who breach the rules,” said MOH.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean man is one of four new coro­n­avirus cases an­nounced yesterday, all of whom were im­ported. There were no new lo­cally trans­mit­ted cases for the ninth day in a row, the long­est</p>
    <p>such pe­riod since a 12-day streak from Jan 23 to Feb 3.</p>
    <p>Yesterday’s fig­ure takes Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,139.</p>
    <p>The new im­ported cases were placed on stay-home no­tice on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>They in­clude a spe­cial pass holder, a per­ma­nent res­i­dent (PR) and a work per­mit holder.</p>
    <p>The spe­cial pass holder ar­rived from Mon­tene­gro to board a ship</p>
    <p>docked here as a crew mem­ber. The PR came from In­dia, while the work per­mit holder ar­rived from In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>Other than the Sin­ga­porean, all the im­ported cases were asymp­to­matic when tested.</p>
    <p>MOH also said yesterday that of the 28 Covid-19 pa­tients in hospi­tal, one is in crit­i­cal con­di­tion in the in­ten­sive care unit. This is the first crit­i­cal case in just over a month since Oct 11.</p>
    <p>To­gether with the 31 pa­tients re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties, Sin­ga­pore has 59 ac­tive cases.</p>
