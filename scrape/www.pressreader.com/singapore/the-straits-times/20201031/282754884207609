    <p>MI­AMI • Peter Mal­nati birdied the fi­nal hole to grab a one-shot lead af­ter the open­ing round of the Ber­muda Cham­pi­onship on Thurs­day in the first PGA Tour event to have fans since the on­set of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mal­nati made nine birdies, in­clud­ing five straight over a scorch­ing stretch around the turn, and one bo­gey for an eight-un­der 63 at Port Royal Golf Course in Southampto­n. Fel­low Amer­i­cans Doug Ghim and Ryan Ar­mour were one shot off the pace.</p>
    <p>Mal­nati, ranked 166th, won his only PGA crown at the 2015 San­der­son Farms Cham­pi­onship, but is com­ing off two of his best tour fin­ishes ear­lier this month, sec­ond at the San­der­son Farms and joint fifth at Las Ve­gas.</p>
    <p>“With ev­ery­thing in the world right now, this is­land is do­ing a phe­nom­e­nal job with their test­ing pro­to­col and keep­ing ev­ery­one safe,” said Mal­nati, whose wife and oneyear-old son fol­lowed him dur­ing his round.</p>
    <p>“I just didn’t know if it was ac­tu­ally go­ing to work for them to get out here. So com­ing off that dis­ap­point­ing bo­gey on 17, I hit a nice drive on 18 and be­fore I even get my yardage or any­thing, I see my wife and boy stand­ing out there.”</p>
    <p>The tour­na­ment is al­low­ing a max­i­mum of 500 fans at Port Royal for each day, mak­ing it the first PGA Tour event to have spec­ta­tors since the Play­ers Cham­pi­onship in March was can­celled af­ter one round be­cause of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Doc Red­man, who holed out for ea­gle from 94 yards at the par-four 15th, was among a group of three play­ers sit­ting two shots back of Mal­nati.</p>
    <p>De­fend­ing cham­pion Bren­don Todd, look­ing to be­come the first player to re­tain a Tour ti­tle since Brooks Koepka at the 2019 PGA Cham­pi­onship, off­set four bo­geys with four birdies for an open­ing 71.</p>
    <p>Separately, the LPGA Tour will stage the Tour­na­ment of Champions with spec­ta­tors for its 2021 sea­son opener from Jan 21-24 at Or­lando, Florida, the women’s cir­cuit an­nounced on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The event, which mixes top play­ers and celebri­ties, will be con­tested at Tran­quilo Golf Course at Four Sea­sons Golf and Sports Club and re­turn through 2024 as part of a three-year con­tract ex­ten­sion an­nounced Thurs­day with Di­a­mond Re­sorts.</p>
    <p>Mex­ico’s Gaby Lopez is the de­fend­ing cham­pion, while for­mer Ma­jor League Base­ball pitcher John Smoltz will chase a third con­sec­u­tive celebrity crown.</p>
    <p>“The par­ties, the food, the at­mos­phere – this isn’t just any tour­na­ment. This is one we def­i­nitely all hope to play in ev­ery year,” said world No. 4 Danielle Kang of the United States.</p>
    <p>A lim­ited num­ber of spec­ta­tors will be al­lowed to at­tend fol­low­ing state, lo­cal and US Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion (CDC) guide­lines. They in­clude med­i­cal screen­ings, daily tem­per­a­ture checks, face masks and so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
