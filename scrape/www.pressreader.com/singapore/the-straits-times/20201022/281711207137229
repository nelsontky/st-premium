    <p>MOSCOW • Rus­sia is not plan­ning to im­pose any fur­ther lock­downs to con­tain the Covid-19 pan­demic, the Krem­lin said yes­ter­day, af­ter the coun­try notched up a record daily death toll of 317.</p>
    <p>Krem­lin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said no harsh re­stric­tions were re­quired to con­tain the virus, and that safety pre­cau­tions, hy­giene and cer­tain curbs im­posed by the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties were key.</p>
    <p>He added that Rus­sia was now bet­ter equipped to re­spond to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“The work that has been done has al­ready yielded re­sults,” Mr Peskov told re­porters on a con­fer­ence call.</p>
    <p>“The health sys­tem is ready to sus­tain the pres­sure caused by the pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Rus­sia’s health watch­dog said it was in­ves­ti­gat­ing af­ter lo­cal me­dia out­let 161.ru re­ported that sev­eral peo­ple in a hos­pi­tal in the south­ern city of Ros­tov-on-Don had died when their oxy­gen sup­ply ran out.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a city of­fi­cial de­nied the re­port.</p>
    <p>Mr Peskov called the re­port alarm­ing.</p>
    <p>Separately, a video clip posted on so­cial me­dia showed at least two dozen bod­ies in black bags on beds or ly­ing on the floor in the base­ment cor­ri­dor of a Siberian hos­pi­tal for Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>The Al­tai re­gion’s Health Min­istry con­firmed the au­then­tic­ity of the video and said the bod­ies had built up be­cause doc­tors have to con­duct post-mortem ex­am­i­na­tions on all Covid-19 vic­tims and were un­able to keep up de­spite work­ing over­time.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia recorded 15,700 new coron­avirus in­fec­tions yes­ter­day, while the daily record high of 317 deaths pushed the to­tal num­ber of fa­tal­i­ties since the start of the pan­demic to 24,952.</p>
    <p>With 1,447,335 in­fec­tions in to­tal, the coun­try of around 145 million has the world’s fourth-largest caseload af­ter that of the United States, In­dia and Brazil.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia has seen 1,096,560 pa­tients re­cover.</p>
    <p>Along with many other Euro­pean coun­tries, Rus­sia has been wit­ness­ing a steep growth in Covid-19 cases over the past weeks, af­ter many re­stric­tions were lifted and so­cial gath­er­ings were seen dur­ing the sum­mer.</p>
    <p>SYS­TEM ABLE TO COPE The work that has been done has al­ready yielded re­sults... The health sys­tem is ready to sus­tain the pres­sure caused by the pan­demic. KREM­LIN SPOKESMAN DMITRY PESKOV, who also said Rus­sia was now bet­ter equipped to re­spond to the pan­demic.</p>
