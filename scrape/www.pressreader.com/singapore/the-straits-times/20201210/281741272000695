    <p>Ja­pan busted its one-day tally of Covid-19 in­fec­tions yes­ter­day with at least 2,810 cases, marked by new highs in tourist hot spots, such as Ky­oto and Hiroshima.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of ac­tive se­ri­ous cases also rose to 555, set­ting a record for the third con­sec­u­tive day and dou­bling in three weeks.</p>
    <p>These un­wanted records will likely mount pres­sure on Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga, who has been in­sist­ing that a Go To Travel cam­paign that pro­vides mas­sive sub­si­dies for do­mes­tic tourists should not be made a scape­goat for the third wave of Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>As his Cab­i­net’s ap­proval tum­bled in three sep­a­rate me­dia polls over the week­end, with more peo­ple dis­ap­prov­ing of his gov­ern­ment’s re­sponse to Covid-19 than in sup­port­ing it, the gov­ern­ment is stand­ing firm on the scheme.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, the gov­ern­ment ap­proved a third stim­u­lus pack­age worth 73.6 tril­lion yen (S$944 bil­lion), in­clud­ing a top-up of 1.35 tril­lion yen to fund an ex­ten­sion of the travel scheme to June, from the orig­i­nal end date of next month.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment did not con­sult its own Covid-19 ad­vi­sory panel of med­i­cal ex­perts on the ex­ten­sion, or lis­ten to their ad­vice. Dr Shigeru Omi, who leads the panel, yes­ter­day again urged the gov­ern­ment to take more de­ci­sive ac­tion: “I’ve re­peat­edly sug­gested that the Go To pro­gramme should be stopped in the cur­rent in­fec­tion sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>And the gov­ern­ment had also rub­bished a sci­en­tific study by a team of re­searchers, in­clud­ing Dr At­sushi Miyawaki of the Grad­u­ate School of Medicine at the Univer­sity of Tokyo, that drew a con­clu­sive link be­tween the travel cam­paign and the rise in cases.</p>
    <p>It was the first such study to do so, and put paid to Mr Suga’s claims that there has been no proof that the cam­paign was to blame.</p>
    <p>Econ­omy Min­is­ter Ya­su­toshi Nishimura, Ja­pan’s point man for Covid-19 strat­egy, said on Tues­day that the study was in­con­clu­sive be­cause it was not peer-re­viewed.</p>
    <p>He also dis­missed it as fun­da­men­tally flawed, not­ing that the 28,000 re­spon­dents, aged be­tween 15 and 79, had not taken poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) tests.</p>
    <p>He ar­gued that they were merely asked if they had ex­hib­ited symp­toms of Covid-19, in­clud­ing fever, cough, headache, sore throat and the loss of sense of taste and smell.</p>
    <p>“Ex­hibit­ing Covid-19 symp­toms clearly does not mean that one is nec­es­sar­ily in­fected with the coro­n­avirus,” he said. “This is an im­por­tant point. The re­searchers only asked about symp­toms.”</p>
    <p>In the study done from Aug 25 to Sept 30, re­spon­dents were asked if they had taken part in the Go To Travel cam­paign, and whether they had Covid-19 symp­toms.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers found “the users of gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies for do­mes­tic travel ex­pe­ri­enced a higher in­ci­dence of symp­toms in­dica­tive of the Covid-19 in­fec­tion”.</p>
    <p>They stressed that PCR tests were not a catch-all, and that symp­toms unique to Covid-19 would serve as a good proxy as “PCR test­ing will un­der­es­ti­mate the true num­ber of in­fec­tions be­cause not ev­ery­one with symp­toms in­dica­tive of Covid-19 is tested”.</p>
    <p>The clash be­tween pol­i­tics and science comes as cases re­main on the rise through­out the coun­try, though Mr Suga is re­luc­tant to crip­ple an econ­omy on the re­bound from a na­tion­wide state of emer­gency ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Hiroshima and Ky­oto, which added 77 and 75 new cases re­spec­tively, were among five pre­fec­tures that set new one-day highs. Aichi, where the in­dus­trial city of Nagoya is lo­cated, also set a new record with 245 cases.</p>
    <p>Tokyo recorded 572 new cases, in its sec­ond-high­est daily tally ever. Osaka, which de­clared a med­i­cal “red alert” and on Mon­day asked for back-up from Self-De­fence Forces nurses, logged 427 new cases in the pre­fec­ture’s third-high­est daily caseload.</p>
    <p>Hokkaido, which also sought re­in­force­ment from mil­i­tary nurses for its sec­ond-largest city Asahikawa, added 197 new cases and ex­tended its pre­fec­ture-wide re­quest for res­i­dents to avoid non-es­sen­tial out­ings for two weeks, un­til Dec 25.</p>
    <p>The Mainichi daily urged the gov­ern­ment to re­think the travel cam­paign and “ap­ply the brakes when ap­pro­pri­ate”, rather than per­sist­ing on a dan­ger­ous course.</p>
