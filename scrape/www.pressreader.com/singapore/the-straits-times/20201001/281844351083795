    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON In the last week, lead­ing epi­demi­ol­o­gists from re­spected in­sti­tu­tions have, through dif­fer­ent meth­ods, reached the same con­clu­sion: About 85 per cent to 90 per cent of the Amer­i­can pop­u­la­tion is still sus­cep­ti­ble to SarsCoV-2, the virus caus­ing the cur­rent pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The num­ber is im­por­tant be­cause it means that “herd im­mu­nity” – the point at which a dis­ease stops spread­ing be­cause nearly ev­ery­one in a pop­u­la­tion has con­tracted it – is still very far off.</p>
    <p>The ev­i­dence came from an­ti­body test­ing and from epi­demi­o­log­i­cal mod­el­ling.</p>
    <p>At the re­quest of The New York Times, three epi­demi­o­log­i­cal teams last week cal­cu­lated the per­cent­age of the coun­try that is in­fected.</p>
    <p>What they found runs strongly counter to a the­ory be­ing pro­moted in in­flu­en­tial cir­cles that the United States has ei­ther al­ready achieved herd im­mu­nity or is close to do­ing so, and that the pan­demic is all but over.</p>
    <p>That con­clu­sion would im­ply that busi­nesses, schools and restau­rants could safely re­open, and that masks and other so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures could be aban­doned.</p>
    <p>“The idea that herd im­mu­nity will hap­pen at 10 per cent or 20 per cent is just non­sense,” said Dr Christo­pher Mur­ray, direc­tor of the Univer­sity of Wash­ing­ton’s In­sti­tute for Health Met­rics and Eval­u­a­tion, which pro­duced the epi­demic model fre­quently cited dur­ing White House news brief­ings as the epi­demic hit hard in the spring.</p>
    <p>That be­lief be­gan cir­cu­lat­ing months ago on con­ser­va­tive news pro­grammes like those of Mr Rush Lim­baugh and Ms Laura In­gra­ham.</p>
    <p>It has been cited sev­eral times by Dr Scott At­las, US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s new pan­demic ad­viser. It ap­pears to be be­hind Mr Trump’s re­cent re­marks that the pan­demic is “round­ing the cor­ner” and “would go away even with­out the vac­cine”.</p>
    <p>Its most vo­cal ad­her­ents are call­ing for mask wear­ing and so­cial dis­tanc­ing to end just as cold weather is shift­ing so­cial ac­tiv­ity in­doors, where the risk of trans­mis­sion is higher.</p>
    <p>Even in places where the pan­demic hit es­pe­cially hard – a French air­craft car­rier, the Brazil­ian city of Manaus, the slums of Mumbai in In­dia and a neigh­bour­hood in Queens, New York – in­fec­tions did not no­tice­ably slow down un­til al­most 60 per cent of the in­hab­i­tants were in­fected.</p>
    <p>And even those lev­els may not suf­fice, given that cases are in­creas­ing again in Brazil and in ar­eas in the New York bor­ough of Brook­lyn that had seen cases spike and then drop off.</p>
    <p>The chief pro­po­nents of the idea that herd im­mu­nity is some­how close at hand con­tend that most peo­ple in the world are im­mune to the virus, thanks to “T cell im­mu­nity” de­rived from hav­ing con­tracted com­mon colds that were caused by the four rela­tively be­nign coro­n­aviruses that have cir­cu­lated for years.</p>
    <p>But this the­ory is un­founded. Dr Thomas Frieden, a for­mer direc­tor of the Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion, said: “Im­mu­nity in 2020 is no closer to be­ing just around the cor­ner than pros­per­ity was in 1930.”</p>
    <p>More than 200,000 Amer­i­cans have al­ready died, and mod­els es­ti­mate that if peo­ple re­turn to old habits, more than 300,000 and pos­si­bly 400,000 could die be­fore a vac­cine is widely avail­able.</p>
