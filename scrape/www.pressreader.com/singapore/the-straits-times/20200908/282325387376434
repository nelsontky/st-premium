    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong star Gil­lian Chung, 39, one half of Can­topop duo Twins, suf­fered a head in­jury in an ac­ci­dent in Xi­a­men, China, and was taken to hos­pi­tal yes­ter­day morn­ing, Hong Kong me­dia re­ported.</p>
    <p>Chung suf­fered a se­ri­ous head in­jury in the ac­ci­dent that took place at about 2am at the ho­tel she was stay­ing in, said the Em­peror En­ter­tain­ment Group, which man­ages her.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the group, Chung was plan­ning to go to the toi­let when she felt giddy and fell, hit­ting the right side of her head against a mar­ble struc­ture.</p>
    <p>Chung called her col­leagues for help, as they rushed to her room and called the hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>They also in­formed her good friend, singer Joey Yung, and man­ager Mani Fok, as they took the first flight from Bei­jing to Xi­a­men to visit her, said the group.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors at the hos­pi­tal did a brain scan and ex­am­ined her head for other in­juries. Her wound was re­ported to be 6cm long and she needed dozens of stitches.</p>
    <p>Chung is re­ported to be in Xi­a­men to film a new drama. She wanted to con­tinue with work as yes­ter­day was sup­posed to be the last day of film­ing, but she was per­suaded by Ms Fok to re­main in hos­pi­tal for ob­ser­va­tion, said the group.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Ap­ple Daily, Chung has mes­saged her fam­ily to in­form them that she was fine.</p>
    <p>She had made the news in May af­ter di­vorc­ing Tai­wanese aes­thet­ics doc­tor Michael Lai, 31. They mar­ried in 2018 and have no chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Dr Lai told the me­dia he has not called her af­ter her re­ported in­jury, but wished her a speedy re­cov­ery.</p>
