    <p>PRO­FES­SOR RENU MAL­HO­TRA, on the clos­est Saturn and Jupiter will come to each other since 1623</p>
    <p>NEW YORK • For months, Saturn and Jupiter have ap­peared to be court­ing, as the gi­ant ce­les­tial bod­ies have grad­u­ally drawn nearer in the night sky.</p>
    <p>Over the next two weeks, as their or­bits align more closely, the plan­ets will pull closer un­til they ap­pear to be just a tenth of a de­gree apart – about the thick­ness of a dime held at arm’s length, ac­cord­ing to the United States’ Na­tional Aero­nau­tics and Space Ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>The en­counter, known as a great con­junc­tion, hap­pens about ev­ery 20 years. But this one – ar­riv­ing on Dec 21, the win­ter sol­stice – is spe­cial, as­tronomers said.</p>
    <p>It will be the clos­est align­ment of Saturn and Jupiter, the largest plan­ets in our so­lar sys­tem, since 1623.</p>
    <p>But that con­junc­tion, just 14 years af­ter Ital­ian as­tronomer Galileo Galilei built his first tele­scope, was 13 de­grees away from the Sun, mak­ing it al­most im­pos­si­ble to view from Earth, said Ms Amy Oliver, a spokesman for the Cen­tre for Astro­physics, Har­vard & Smith­so­nian.</p>
    <p>This one will be the clos­est vis­i­ble en­counter be­tween the two giants since the Mid­dle Ages, in 1226, Ms Oliver added.</p>
    <p>The next time the plan­ets will be this close is 2080, she said, mak­ing the event a once-in-a-life­time spec­ta­cle for most adults.</p>
    <p>Across the US, the best view of the two com­ing into near-align­ment will be just af­ter sun­set, in the south-western por­tion of the sky.</p>
    <p>“It’s a very el­e­gant as­tro­nom­i­cal event to watch in the night sky,” said Pro­fes­sor Renu Mal­ho­tra, a plan­e­tary sciences ex­pert at the Univer­sity of Ari­zona. “It’s a very ro­man­tic event – to see th­ese plan­ets ap­proach­ing each other.”</p>
    <p>Al­though best viewed with binoc­u­lars or a tele­scope, the en­counter should be vis­i­ble to the naked eye.</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of plan­e­tary sci­ence Kon­stantin Baty­gin said he had been watch­ing Jupiter, his favourite planet, and Saturn draw closer to each other on nightly walks with his dog.</p>
    <p>“It’s the rare as­tro­nom­i­cal event where you can ap­pre­ci­ate the mo­tion of the plan­ets around the sun with­out be­ing some kind of as­tronomer,” Prof Baty­gin said.</p>
    <p>“You can still go out­side close to Christ­mas and say, ‘Wow, those two plan­ets sure are close to one an­other, and they aren’t usu­ally’. It’s one of th­ese rare times when the majesty of the so­lar sys­tem presents it­self to the naked eye.”</p>
    <p>But such en­coun­ters were not al­ways viewed so lyri­cally.</p>
    <p>Prof Mal­ho­tra said that in an­cient times, peo­ple con­sid­ered plan­e­tary align­ments to be bad omens, por­tend­ing calamity.</p>
    <p>“There was rea­son to fear that the gods were con­spir­ing when they got closer in the night sky,” she said. “It might have omi­nous mean­ing to peo­ple on earth.”</p>
    <p>The con­junc­tion is the re­sult of the or­bital paths of Jupiter and Saturn com­ing into line, as viewed from Earth. Jupiter or­bits the sun about ev­ery 12 years, and Saturn about ev­ery 29 years.</p>
    <p>Al­though they will ap­pear to be close to­gether – re­sem­bling a bright ball or a tipped-over snow­man in the sky, Ms Oliver said – the plan­ets will not ac­tu­ally be that close.</p>
    <p>In fact, they will be more than 64 mil­lion km apart, she said.</p>
