    <p>With Sin­ga­pore mak­ing a name for it­self as a cen­tre for al­ter­na­tive dis­pute res­o­lu­tion, even an old hand like Bri­tain has said it can “learn a lot from the ap­proach Sin­ga­pore has taken in re­cent decades” on the sub­ject.</p>
    <p>A Bri­tish par­lia­men­tary group said this in a re­port is­sued last month that was based on a week­long study visit to Sin­ga­pore in Au­gust last year.</p>
    <p>The All-Party Par­lia­men­tary Group for Al­ter­na­tive Dis­pute Res­o­lu­tion (ADR) also said: “From adopt­ing a ‘whole-of-govern­ment’ pol­icy for dis­putes pol­icy to ef­forts to boost the sta­tus of me­di­a­tion as a means for set­tling in­ter­na­tional com­mer­cial dis­putes, there are sev­eral el­e­ments of the Sin­ga­porean ap­proach which we think the UK should em­u­late and, where nec­es­sary, adapt and mod­ify.”</p>
    <p>The group is one of many cross­party in­for­mal groups com­pris­ing mem­bers of both Houses of Bri­tain’s Par­lia­ment with a com­mon in­ter­est in par­tic­u­lar is­sues.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the visit, the group met key fig­ures from the Sin­ga­pore Govern­ment, ju­di­ciary and busi­ness to learn more about how the coun­try has es­tab­lished it­self as a lead­ing global dis­putes hub.</p>
    <p>The re­port, ti­tled “Se­cur­ing the UK’s po­si­tion as a global dis­putes hub: Best prac­tice lessons be­tween Sin­ga­pore and the UK”, said: “The holis­tic ap­proach to ADR in Sin­ga­pore’s court sys­tem is mir­rored by the ac­tions taken by the Govern­ment across the board.”</p>
    <p>The re­port cited the devel­op­ment of Maxwell Cham­bers as Sin­ga­pore’s ded­i­cated in­te­grated ADR cen­tre, with seed cap­i­tal pro­vided by the Govern­ment, as “one of the most tan­gi­ble ex­am­ples”, not­ing it was part of a “holis­tic, for­ward-look­ing strat­egy to give real heft to the coun­try’s dis­putes sec­tor”.</p>
    <p>It added: “Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon is hugely re­spected world­wide for his con­tri­bu­tions to the ADR sec­tor and through his in­flu­ence me­di­a­tion, has taken great strides for­ward, both in Sin­ga­pore and in­ter­na­tion­ally.”</p>
    <p>In­dus­try play­ers here said the re­port is a nod to Sin­ga­pore’s ef­forts to be a top global ADR hub. Mr Chou Sean Yu, WongPart­ner­ship’s head of lit­i­ga­tion and dis­pute res­o­lu­tion, said: “It is heart­en­ing that this group has made var­i­ous ob­ser­va­tions in its re­port which re­flects that the steps taken in Sin­ga­pore to pro­mote it­self as a hub for dis­pute res­o­lu­tion are clearly pro­gres­sive and on the right track.</p>
    <p>“The Govern­ment’s lead, the ju­di­ciary’s ex­cel­lence and the con­certed sup­port from the var­i­ous stake­hold­ers in the Sin­ga­pore le­gal ecosys­tem have now re­ceived, in this re­port, de­served recog­ni­tion.”</p>
