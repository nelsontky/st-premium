    <p>Don­ning Team Sin­ga­pore’s jersey at the SEA Games in the Philip­pines last De­cem­ber is a mem­ory that e-sports player Ste­fan “Soul” Chong will cher­ish as he logs off for good af­ter com­pet­ing in his fi­nal tour­na­ment next year.</p>
    <p>Chong, 25, was part of the Mo­bile Leg­ends team who com­peted in e-sports’ de­but at the re­gional Games, where they fin­ished third in their group and did not qual­ify for the next round.</p>
    <p>Mo­bile Leg­ends is a mo­bile multi-player on­line battle arena game i n which two op­pos­ing teams fight to de­stroy the en­emy’s base while de­fend­ing their own for con­trol of a path, which con­nects the bases.</p>
    <p>“The SEA Games is a pres­ti­gious event for ath­letes and I never thought that I could be part of the SEA Games as an ath­lete for Sin­ga­pore,” said the cap­tain of the Evos SG team.</p>
    <p>“It’s kind of a dream come true to wear the Team Sin­ga­pore jersey.”</p>
    <p>Hav­ing grad­u­ated from the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy last month, he is ready to call time on his three-year pro­fes­sional es­ports ca­reer af­ter play­ing his fi­nal tour­na­ments: the Nov 27-Dec 6 Mo­bile Leg­ends Pro­fes­sional League In­vi­ta­tional and the M2 World Cham­pi­onship next year.</p>
    <p>Chong, who is plan­ning to look for a job, said: “I have mixed feel­ings.</p>
    <p>I’m look­ing for­ward to my ca­reer (out­side of e-sports), but it’s quite sad to leave the scene know­ing I’ve built up a strong fan base and won’t be able to see the friends I’ve made in the game as of­ten.”</p>
    <p>He is not ex­pect­ing things to be easy at the league in­vi­ta­tional with pow­er­houses In­done­sia and the Philip­pines fea­tur­ing in the yearend com­pe­ti­tion, which is his big­gest this sea­son.</p>
    <p>The Mo­bile Leg­ends Pro­fes­sional League In­vi­ta­tional is or­gan­ised by One Es­ports, the game’s de­vel­oper Moon­ton, and In­done­sia’s Min­istry of Tourism and Cre­ative Econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Twenty South-east Asian teams, in­clud­ing from Malaysia and Myan­mar, will com­pete for a prize pool of US$100,000 (S$135,000).</p>
    <p>Chong’s Evos SG and Resur­gence are the two teams from Sin­ga­pore who will be par­tic­i­pat­ing in the tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>Carlos Alimu­rung, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of One Es­ports, said: “I’m proud of how the One Es­ports and Moon­ton re­la­tion­ship has blos­somed to now in­clude this unique com­pe­ti­tion, which, for the first time, will en­able the best teams from each of the four Mo­bile Leg­ends Pro­fes­sional Leagues to com­pete in an on­line tour­na­ment.”</p>
    <p>With the cur­tains set to come down on his ca­reer, Chong is hope­ful that e-sports will even­tu­ally be seen in the same light as tra­di­tional sports so that more tal­ented play­ers will be given op­por­tu­ni­ties to ex­cel.</p>
    <p>He said: “Maybe be­cause of our ap­pear­ance, maybe we do not look ath­letic, and there’s that so­cial stigma that we are just play­ing games.</p>
    <p>“I hope for that to go away in the near fu­ture and if there’s enough sup­port, we can ac­tu­ally have promis­ing tal­ents that could go into e-sports and make Sin­ga­pore proud with proper train­ing.”</p>
    <p>It’s quite sad to leave the scene know­ing that I’ve built up a strong fan base and won’t be able to see the friends I’ve made in the game as of­ten. STE­FAN “SOUL” CHONG, on call­ing time on his three-year pro­fes­sional e-sports ca­reer.</p>
