    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Turf Club (STC) has cut the prize money of its fea­ture races by up to 50 per cent, as well as can­celling three such races, to sus­tain the coro­n­avirus-af­fected Sin­ga­pore rac­ing in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>This trans­lates to more than $4 mil­lion which will help ease such dif­fi­cult and un­cer­tain times.</p>
    <p>The STC said that, due to the on­go­ing manda­tory re­stric­tions on pub­lic at­ten­dances at the race­course and off-course bet­ting cen­tres, it is “fac­ing a hugely neg­a­tive fi­nan­cial out­look” for the fi­nan­cial year 2020/2021.</p>
    <p>“The club, there­fore, has to un­der­take cost man­age­ment mea­sures to sus­tain the rac­ing in­dus­try in Sin­ga­pore,” it said.</p>
    <p>“We have taken the de­ci­sion to can­cel three races, namely Chair­man’s Tro­phy, Jumbo Jet Tro­phy and El Dorado Clas­sic with ef­fect from Aug 1, 2020.</p>
    <p>“In ad­di­tion, the club also needs to ra­tio­nalise the prize money struc­ture for the re­main­ing fea­ture races to bet­ter man­age the fi­nan­cial losses.”</p>
    <p>Its mar­quee event – the Kranji Mile – will see the stakes re­duced from $1.5 mil­lion to $1 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>It was sup­posed to be run on May 23 as an in­vi­ta­tion race, but was post­poned to Aug 16 be­cause of the</p>
    <p>Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>It was also changed from an In­ter­na­tional Group 3 event to a do­mes­tic Group 1 af­fair re­stricted to Sin­ga­pore horses.</p>
    <p>The Group 1 Sin­ga­pore Derby, which was post­poned from April 18 to Sept 6, will be see its prize money halved – from $1 mil­lion to $500,000.</p>
    <p>The stakes for the Group 1 Sin­ga­pore Gold Cup, which is tra­di­tion­ally run in Novem­ber, re­main at $1 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Other Group 1 fea­tures, such as the Sin­ga­pore Guineas (Sept 26), Lion City Cup, Raf­fles Cup and Queen Elizabeth II Cup, will now carry $400,000 – a 50 per cent cut.</p>
    <p>The Mer­lion Tro­phy (Aug 23), Sin­ga­pore Clas­sic (Aug 30), Stew­ards’ Cup and EW Barker Tro­phy – all Group 2 races – are now worth $250,000, in­stead of $400,000. This con­sti­tutes to a 37.5 per cent re­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>Group 3 races will take a 14.3 per cent cut to $150,000 (from $175,000). They are the New Year Cup, For­tune Bowl, Sil­ver Bowl and Colo­nial Chief Stakes.</p>
    <p>Al­though the Sin­ga­pore Golden Horse­shoe is a Group 3 race, it will carry lower prize money – $125,000.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­a­tion of Race­horse Train­ers (Sin­ga­pore) pres­i­dent Michael Cle­ments said it is in­evitable that there will be fi­nan­cial cuts in cer­tain ar­eas, with the neg­a­tive im­pact that Covid-19 pan­demic has had on the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“For­tu­nately, most of the fea­ture races will be staged as planned, al­beit for lesser stake money,” added the sea­son’s lead­ing trainer. “We must re­main pos­i­tive and keep mov­ing for­ward through these dif­fi­cult times and, hope­fully, all will re­turn to pros­per­ity in 2021.”</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has also hit many other rac­ing coun­tries hard, caus­ing shut­downs and prize­money re­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the prize money for the pres­ti­gious four-day Royal As­cot meet­ing in Eng­land in June was more than halved.</p>
    <p>A Reuters re­port had the or­gan­is­ers as say­ing in De­cem­ber that more than £8 mil­lion (S$14.1 mil­lion) would be of­fered, with the meet­ing host­ing mil­lion-pound races for the first time.</p>
    <p>But this was even­tu­ally re­duced to £3.68 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Reuters re­ported As­cot Race­course chief ex­ec­u­tive Guy Hen­der­son’s state­ment that 2020 had been set to be a land­mark year be­fore the “un­prece­dented times”.</p>
    <p>“Some 70 per cent of our an­nual in­come comes from pub­lic ad­mis­sions, in­clud­ing hos­pi­tal­ity,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore rac­ing was halted in early April and re­sumed on July 11 be­hind closed doors. There were only two race days for last month.</p>
    <p>There are just four race days each this month and next month.</p>
