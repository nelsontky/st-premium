    <p>PHOENIX • The Phoenix Suns will try to con­tinue the joint-best start in the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion when they host the Los An­ge­les Clip­pers this morn­ing.</p>
    <p>While they failed to qual­ify for the play-offs last sea­son, the Suns were the hottest team dur­ing the reg­u­lar-sea­son por­tion of the “bub­ble” as the only one to win all eight games.</p>
    <p>Phoenix have car­ried over that form with a 5-1 start and have won four in a row to move atop the Western Con­fer­ence stand­ings.</p>
    <p>But the Suns are not get­ting car­ried away de­spite mak­ing their best start to a cam­paign since the 2009-10 sea­son, when they won eight of their first nine games and even­tu­ally qual­i­fied for the play­offs.</p>
    <p>That was the last time Phoenix reached the post-sea­son and with their re­peated fail­ures in mind, the team are keep­ing grounded.</p>
    <p>“It’s early. It’s a long sea­son,” star sum­mer acquisitio­n Chris Paul said. “We’re just try­ing to pile up wins.”</p>
    <p>His ex­pe­ri­ence was why the Suns traded four play­ers plus a 2022 pro­tected first-round pick as they seek to fi­nally get over the line this term.</p>
    <p>All-Star Paul spent six sea­sons with the Clip­pers, lead­ing them to the play-offs ev­ery year.</p>
    <p>The guard also reached the post­sea­son in the past three sea­sons with the Hous­ton Rock­ets and the Ok­la­homa City Thun­der, and it is a streak he wants to con­tinue with the Suns.</p>
    <p>His new team­mates have al­ready no­ticed a dif­fer­ence when the 35-year-old is on the floor.</p>
    <p>“Chris is the guy who’s very vo­cal,” cen­tre De­an­dre Ay­ton said. “He knows how things need to be done.”</p>
    <p>The hosts will need to call on ev­ery bit of Paul’s know-how as they take on the vis­it­ing Clip­pers in what will be their big­gest test of the nascent sea­son.</p>
    <p>Widely tipped as cham­pi­onship con­tenders, Los An­ge­les are off to a 4-2 start, with All-Star duo Kawhi Leonard (23.8 points per game) and Paul Ge­orge (22.8) lead­ing the team in scor­ing and most other cat­e­gories.</p>
    <p>Leonard, the 2019 Fi­nals Most Valu­able Player, is set to play his third straight game in a mask af­ter re­ceiv­ing eight stitches when he was struck by a stray el­bow from team­mate Serge Ibaka on Christ­mas Day that caused him to miss two sub­se­quent con­tests.</p>
    <p>The for­ward is hope­ful of play­ing mask-free soon.</p>
    <p>“It’s still un­com­fort­able,” he ad­mit­ted. “I don’t know how you get used to wear­ing some­thing on your head, you know what I mean? It’s not some­thing I want to do but I’m try­ing to pro­tect my­self right now. It’ll be off soon.”</p>
