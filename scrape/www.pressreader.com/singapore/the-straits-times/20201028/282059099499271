    <p>She has fos­tered five chil­dren in the past eight years, and in that time also started a com­mu­nity ini­tia­tive to help needy fam­i­lies and vul­ner­a­ble se­niors. House­wife Sarimah Amat also runs a pro­gramme to pro­vide sta­tionery to needy chil­dren here and abroad, has helped orphans in Thai­land and In­done­sia and or­gan­ised re­lief ef­forts for flood vic­tims in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>For her ef­forts, the 53-year-old was recog­nised as the in­au­gu­ral Yishunite of the Year yes­ter­day. Or­gan­ised by Nee Soon Town Coun­cil, the award recog­nises a Nee Soon GRC res­i­dent who has con­trib­uted to the com­mu­nity and em­bod­ies the spirit of ser­vice and giv­ing.</p>
    <p>Madam Sarimah, who re­ceived the most votes among five fi­nal­ists in a Face­book poll, had to leave her job as a child­care teacher and silat in­struc­tor in 2010 due to a knee in­jury. Hav­ing worked for a decade, she won­dered what to pur­sue next.</p>
    <p>She found out about the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment’s fos­ter­ing scheme from her brother, and de­cided to ap­ply. “I wanted to do some­thing that is sat­is­fy­ing to the soul, and not just for mon­e­tary value. It is more of help­ing peo­ple out of their predica­ments and their chal­lenges,” said Madam Sarimah.</p>
    <p>In 2012, she took in a four-yearold girl, who is still liv­ing with her. The fol­low­ing year, she took in a three-year-old boy but he died from in­fan­tile epilepsy seven months later. In 2014, Madam Sarimah fos­tered a three-year-old boy for half a year, and in 2015 took in a two-year-old boy for five months. She wel­comed a twom­onth-old girl into her home in 2016, and the child is also still liv­ing with her.</p>
    <p>Madam Sarimah’s own three chil­dren are all grown up. Her el­dest child is 29. He is mar­ried and he and his wife have a 10-month-old daugh­ter. Madam Sarimah also has a 27-year-old daugh­ter and another son, 25, who is do­ing his na­tional ser­vice i n the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force. Her hus­band, 54, is a con­struc­tion safety su­per­vi­sor.</p>
    <p>The nine of them live in a mini jumbo flat i n Yishun Street 71, which has been home to Madam Sarimah for 35 years now.</p>
    <p>Com­ment­ing on her fos­ter­ing, she said: “It is still with a heavy heart that you let them go, but at the end of the day it is time for them to re­turn to their fam­i­lies... I be­lieve while they are with us, in our care, we still have to nur­ture them with the best knowl­edge and val­ues.”</p>
    <p>Madam Sarimah started a com­mu­nity ini­tia­tive called Yishun 71 in March this year, to help vul­ner­a­ble se­niors and needy fam­i­lies in 16 blocks in her es­tate, in­clud­ing by de­liv­er­ing food, tak­ing them for health check-ups and buy­ing gro­ceries for them. She said she is hon­oured to win the award, and com­mended her fel­low fi­nal­ists, say­ing: “The main thing is we’re help­ing the com­mu­nity. It just makes me more de­ter­mined to do more and reach out to more peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Nee Soon GRC MP Der­rick Goh, who chairs Nee Soon Town Coun­cil, said: “I’m glad that with the start of Yishunite of the Year, more of Sin­ga­pore can get to know Yishun as the some­what quirky but ul­ti­mately car­ing com­mu­nity that we are.”</p>
