    <p>NEW YORK • The for­mula for re­tail­ers on Black Fri­day is usu­ally pretty sim­ple: Cut prices, stock shelves, pre­pare for crowds and make sure or­ders ar­rive on time. This year – like ev­ery­thing in 2020 – is any­thing but.</p>
    <p>Amer­ica’s big­gest ap­parel re­tail­ers and de­part­ment stores are anx­ious ahead of the cru­cial hol­i­day pe­riod. That is be­cause all the new tools they have hastily rolled out and scaled up amid the global pan­demic, such as in-store and curb­side pickup and di­rect ship­ping from stores, have not re­ally been bat­tle-tested. So if they fail, an al­ready dis­as­trous year could get that much worse.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese com­pa­nies are used to some­what reg­u­lar pat­terns,” said Fitch Rat­ings re­tail an­a­lyst David Sil­ver­man. “All of that has gone out of the win­dow.”</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies have laid out how they are get­ting ready: Kohl’s Corp chief ex­ec­u­tive Michelle Gass, for ex­am­ple, said she is push­ing shop­pers to retrieve their on­line pur­chases in stores, in­stead of get­ting them shipped to their homes. This would re­lieve the com­pany’s dis­tri­bu­tion cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Old Navy CEO Nancy Green, mean­while, said the bud­get ap­parel chain is ship­ping more prod­ucts di­rectly from stores to cus­tomers’ homes.</p>
    <p>But it is clear that this year is dif­fer­ent. Levi Strauss & Co CEO Chip Bergh has said he is con­cerned enough about the po­ten­tial crunch around the hol­i­days that he may move the guar­an­teed ship-by date ear­lier than usual.</p>
    <p>That means the win­dow of time around the hol­i­days in which ship­ping times are not guar­an­teed, due to the high vol­ume of or­ders, would start ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Data showed com­pa­nies have cause for con­cern. More than half of United States shop­pers said they would not buy from a store again if they were un­sat­is­fied with the de­liv­ery ex­pe­ri­ence, ac­cord­ing to a Septem­ber sur­vey from Ac­cen­ture. On­line sales are ex­pected to spike 33 per cent to US$189 bil­lion (S$254 bil­lion), test­ing the lim­its of ful­fil­ment networks across the US, ac­cord­ing to Adobe An­a­lyt­ics.</p>
    <p>Shares of Amazon.com and es­sen­tial re­tail­ers such as Tar­get and Wal­mart have gained this year, while de­part­ment stores and many ap­parel chains have slumped amid de­clin­ing sales.</p>
    <p>Many of th­ese non-es­sen­tial re­tail­ers closed down dur­ing the lockdown ear­lier this year and used that time to re­fine their e-com­merce op­er­a­tions with an eye on the hol­i­day sea­son.</p>
    <p>But Fitch’s Mr Sil­ver­man said he is con­cerned that new pro­grammes adopted by re­tail­ers may not be pre­cise enough for them to ac­cu­rately report in­ven­tory and limit de­lays and snags, which could po­ten­tially im­pact sales.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tion­ally, con­sumer habits are chang­ing dra­mat­i­cally dur­ing the pan­demic, and many in­dus­try ob­servers said that shifts to­wards e-com­merce and so­cially dis­tanced shop­ping meth­ods could be per­ma­nent. So if shop­pers do not have a good ex­pe­ri­ence, re­tail­ers risk los­ing them for good.</p>
    <p>De­part­ment stores, in par­tic­u­lar, want to keep shop­pers happy. It has been one of the worst per­form­ing ar­eas in re­tail, and Macy’s and Kohl’s have shed more than US$7 bil­lion in mar­ket value this year. The manda­tory lock­downs erased mil­lions in sales ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Big-box stores Wal­mart and Tar­get, which have ben­e­fited from pantry load­ing this year, also report quar­terly re­sults this week. The lat­est round of dis­clo­sures is ex­pected to shed light on how re­tail­ers are han­dling ship­ping and higher de­mand in the fi­nal weeks of the year.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies should be ready for a flood of shop­pers pick­ing up or­ders, both inside stores and out­side in the park­ing lot. An­a­lysts at Adobe An­a­lyt­ics expect pick-up lines to lengthen as Christmas ap­proaches and us­age of pick-up op­tions to spike 40 per cent com­pared with last year, sur­pass­ing stan­dard mail ship­ping as the most pop­u­lar buy­ing op­tion.</p>
    <p>At the same time, higher levels of e-com­merce will strain tra­di­tional car­ri­ers like FedEx and United Par­cel Ser­vice, which re­tail­ers fear may limit ship­ping ca­pac­ity from stores as or­ders ramp up.</p>
    <p>Both com­pa­nies are pre­par­ing for el­e­vated de­mand at the end of the year amid a rise in e-com­merce.</p>
