    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong will meet his re­gional coun­ter­parts vir­tu­ally for this week’s Asean Sum­mit and re­lated meet­ings, dur­ing which the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (RCEP) trade deal is ex­pected to be signed. The deal’s con­clu­sion has been a key goal of the group­ing this year.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong will meet his re­gional coun­ter­parts vir­tu­ally for this week’s Asean Sum­mit and re­lated meet­ings, dur­ing which the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (RCEP) trade deal is ex­pected to be signed, af­ter years of ne­go­ti­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Other items on the agenda in­clude the of­fi­cial launch of the re­gion’s re­serve stock­pile of es­sen­tial med­i­cal sup­plies, as well as the Asean Com­pre­hen­sive Re­cov­ery Frame­work to help coun­tries re­bound from the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In line with this year’s theme – Co­he­sive and Re­spon­sive Asean – re­gional lead­ers will also dis­cuss the public health and so­cioe­co­nomic chal­lenges posed by Covid-19, and chart a path to re­cov­ery, said the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“The lead­ers will also ex­change views on re­gional and in­ter­na­tional is­sues, and con­tinue dis­cus­sions on how to strengthen re­gional co­op­er­a­tion, re­in­force Asean cen­tral­ity and pro­mote re­gional peace and sta­bil­ity,” it added.</p>
    <p>This week’s meet­ings will be chaired by Viet­nam’s Prime Min­is­ter Nguyen Xuan Phuc, whose</p>
    <p>coun­try holds the ro­tat­ing chair­man­ship of Asean this year.</p>
    <p>The con­clu­sion of the re­gion­wide trade deal, which is set to be signed on Sun­day, has been a key goal of the group­ing this year. If ev­ery­thing falls into place, the RCEP will be the world’s largest trade</p>
    <p>pact, even with­out the in­clu­sion of In­dia, which pulled out last year.</p>
    <p>The deal in­volves 15 coun­tries: Asean’s 10 mem­ber states, as well as China, Ja­pan, South Korea, Aus­tralia and New Zealand. To­gether, they con­trib­ute about one-third of the world’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct.</p>
    <p>Asean alone has a pop­u­la­tion of nearly 640 mil­lion peo­ple and a com­bined gross do­mes­tic prod­uct of US$2.57 tril­lion (S$3.47 tril­lion). Some sug­gest that it is poised to be­come the fourth-largest econ­omy in the world by 2030.</p>
    <p>Se­nior In­done­sian trade of­fi­cial</p>
    <p>Iman Pam­bagyo, who chairs the RCEP Trade Ne­go­ti­at­ing Com­mit­tee, told The Straits Times that par­tic­i­pat­ing coun­tries hope the agree­ment will drive eco­nomic re­cov­ery in the next two years in the re­gion, where a re­gional sup­ply chain has been built, thanks to ex­ist­ing free trade deals be­tween Asean and its trad­ing part­ners.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ters from the RCEP par­tic­i­pat­ing coun­tries noted in June that the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has added the im­por­tance of the deal.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Iman added: “Against the back­drop of low con­fi­dence in the mul­ti­lat­eral trad­ing sys­tem, on­go­ing trade ten­sions amongst a num­ber of coun­tries, ris­ing pro­tec­tion­ism and the im­pact of Covid-19, the sign­ing of the RCEP is a sig­nal to the world and busi­nesses that coun­tries in this re­gion re­main op­ti­mistic and have a for­ward-look­ing ori­en­ta­tion in terms of deep­en­ing and ex­pand­ing re­gional eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion to play a bolder role in the global value chain.”</p>
    <p>The twice-yearly meet­ings of re­gional lead­ers of­fi­cially start to­day and will end on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>To­day, Asean lead­ers will have their an­nual sum­mits with China, In­dia, Ja­pan and South Korea. The Asean-Ja­pan Sum­mit will see the launch of the new Asean Cen­tre for Public Health Emer­gen­cies and Emerg­ing Dis­eases. The in­au­gu­ral Asean Women Lead­ers’ Sum­mit will also take place this evening.</p>
    <p>On Satur­day, Asean lead­ers will have sum­mits with the United States, Aus­tralia and New Zealand, as well as the Asean Plus Three Sum­mit with China, Ja­pan and South Korea. The East Asia Sum­mit (EAS) will cap that day’s meet­ings.</p>
    <p>The EAS is a fo­rum for the 10 Asean na­tions and their eight key part­ners – Aus­tralia, China, In­dia, Ja­pan, New Zealand, South Korea, the US and Rus­sia – to dis­cuss po­lit­i­cal, se­cu­rity and eco­nomic is­sues af­fect­ing the wider Asia-Pa­cific re­gion.</p>
    <p>The var­i­ous ini­tia­tives launched at the Asean sum­mit will help chart the re­gion’s re­cov­ery, said For­eign Min­is­ter Vi­vian Balakrishn­an in a Face­book post on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>At the close of the sum­mit, Viet­nam will hand over the Asean chair­man­ship to Brunei.</p>
