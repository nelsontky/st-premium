    <p>Two cruise lines have been given the green light to of­fer cruises to nowhere from Sin­ga­pore start­ing next month, giv­ing lo­cals what is likely to be their only op­tion for a year-end overseas hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>Gent­ing Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean In­ter­na­tional will be part of a “safe cruise” pi­lot scheme that will cater only to Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents, at a re­duced ca­pac­ity of 50 per cent, the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The round-trip cruises will not have ports of call, and fea­ture strict screen­ing and safety mea­sures to pre­vent the on-board spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>All pas­sen­gers will have to be tested for Covid-19 prior to board­ing as part of the STB’s Cruise Safe pro­gramme, jointly de­vel­oped by global classifica­tion body DNV GL.</p>
    <p>They will also have to com­ply with safe man­age­ment mea­sures, such as mask-wear­ing and safe dis­tanc­ing of 1m be­tween groups. The travel group size is also sub­ject to pre­vail­ing laws on group sizes.</p>
    <p>Cruise lines must be au­dited and re­ceive Cruise Safe cer­ti­fi­ca­tion to sail out of Sin­ga­pore, the STB said.</p>
    <p>Manda­tory mea­sures in­clude test­ing of pas­sen­gers and crew, en­sur­ing fresh air through­out the ship and emer­gency re­sponse plans for in­ci­dents re­lated to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Ship crew ar­riv­ing from overseas will be sub­ject to iso­la­tion and test­ing re­quire­ments both in their home coun­try and here.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­lar on-board in­spec­tions will be con­ducted, and cruise lines found to be non-com­pli­ant will face penalties in­clud­ing fines, sus­pen­sion of sail­ings and hav­ing their CruiseSafe cer­ti­fi­ca­tions re­voked, the STB said.</p>
    <p>Cruise ships have not been al­lowed to call here since March 13, when the Re­pub­lic joined a num­ber of coun­tries in clos­ing its ports to these ves­sels over fears that they may carry in­fected pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>The Di­a­mond Princess, which was quar­an­tined off the coast of Ja­pan in Fe­bru­ary, served as a cau­tion­ary tale of the coro­n­avirus’ rapid spread, with more than 700 pas­sen­gers and crew mem­bers found ill.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tious dis­ease ex­perts say the like­li­hood of an out­break on board Sin­ga­pore’s planned cruises is low, given the strin­gent mea­sures and lack of ports of call, though there is no guar­an­tee that test­ing will elim­i­nate the pos­si­bil­ity of an in­fected per­son em­bark­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms An­nie Chang, STB’s cruise di­rec­tor, told The Straits Times that with the ap­pro­pri­ate mea­sures in place, such cruises are no less safe than other ac­tiv­i­ties that have re­sumed in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Con­tin­gency plans are in place in the event of an in­fec­tion or out­break, she said. These in­clude iso­lat­ing in­fected pas­sen­gers and their close con­tacts, ceas­ing on-board ac­tiv­i­ties and hav­ing the ship re­turn to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The tourism board said that Sin­ga­pore is one of the first coun­tries in the world to de­velop and im­ple­ment a manda­tory au­dit and cer­ti­fi­ca­tion pro­gramme for cruise lines, adding that it aims to set a bench­mark for the fu­ture of cruis­ing in the South­east Asian re­gion as the lead co­or­di­na­tor for cruises in Asean.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment will mon­i­tor the out­comes of the pi­lot trips care­fully in the com­ing months be­fore de­cid­ing on the next steps for cruises, STB said.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers said the re­sump­tion of cruises from Sin­ga­pore and its cer­ti­fi­ca­tion pro­gramme are a step for­ward for the cruise in­dus­try, which has been largely on pause for more than six months.</p>
    <p>Ms Kelly Craig­head, pres­i­dent and chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Cruise Lines In­ter­na­tional As­so­ci­a­tion, said that it sup­ports a mea­sured and care­fully man­aged re­sump­tion of lo­cal cruise itin­er­ar­ies that work within in­ter­na­tional bor­der re­stric­tions, such as those an­nounced in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“We have seen a very lim­ited and care­fully con­trolled re­sump­tion of cruise oper­a­tions in some ar­eas, most no­tably in Europe and parts of Asia. The suc­cesses of these oper­a­tions, to­gether with the ex­ten­sive health mea­sures that sup­port them, will help in­form the cruise in­dus­try’s global re­sponse to Covid-19,” she said.</p>
