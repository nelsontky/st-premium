    <p>Two Bri­tish na­tion­als who flouted safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod by gath­er­ing with oth­ers in Robert­son Quay were fined yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Al­fred Jon Veloso War­ing, 35, and Ola­gunju Daniel Olalekan Ola­sunkanmi, 31, each faced one charge of breach­ing Covid-19 mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Ola­sunkanmi was fined $8,500, while War­ing was fined $8,000.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that the two men are work pass hold­ers. Both were rep­re­sented by Mr Ra­machan­dran Shiever Subra­ma­niam.</p>
    <p>The court heard that at 3.47pm on May 16, Ola­sunkanmi greeted a woman who was sit­ting on the steps near River­gate Con­do­minium. An­other woman who had a child with her joined them soon af­ter.</p>
    <p>At 4.53pm, War­ing ar­rived and joined them. Both men left and re­turned with beer and wa­ter re­peat­edly un­til 6.45pm when they were ap­proached by safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors.</p>
    <p>The am­bas­sadors f ound that those among the group ei­ther had their masks pulled down or were not wear­ing them. They also did not main­tain a distance of at least 1m from one an­other.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate case, a group of seven oth­ers were also fined in June for meet­ing up in Robert­son Quay on the same day. Six of them had their work passes re­voked by the Min­istry of Man­power and were banned from work­ing here again. The min­istry did not name them.</p>
    <p>Four were each fined $9,000, and three were fined $8,000 each.</p>
    <p>Pic­tures of crowds at Robert­son Quay cir­cu­lated on so­cial me­dia in May, show­ing peo­ple not keep­ing a 1m distance from one an­other at</p>
    <p>The am­bas­sadors found that those among the group ei­ther had their masks pulled down or were not wear­ing them. They also did not main­tain a distance of at least 1m from one an­other.</p>
    <p>the river­side din­ing en­clave.</p>
    <p>Most of the peo­ple pic­tured were not wear­ing masks, while some had their masks low­ered.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tors Ti­motheus Koh and Colin Ng asked for a fine of at least $9,000 for each of the two men, not­ing that their in­ter­ac­tion with oth­ers was lengthy – about one hour and 51 min­utes for War­ing and two hours and 45 min­utes for Ola­sunkanmi.</p>
    <p>DPP Ng urged the court to give suf­fi­cient weight to the fact that the pair com­mit­ted the act in “full view of the pub­lic” and were “un­daunted and un­de­terred” that their ac­tions would cause alarm to those ad­her­ing to safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Mr Subra­ma­niam sought a fine of $7,000 each. He ar­gued that the gath­er­ing was a “chance meet­ing” and took place in one lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Re­gard­ing Ola­sunkanmi, Mr Subra­ma­niam ar­gued that he was con­fined alone dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, so when he chanced upon his friends, he “lin­gered”.</p>
