    <p>UN­PER­TURBED BY A FAN’S</p>
    <p>“MAR­RIAGE PRO­POSAL”: Even a man try­ing to gain at­ten­tion by “propos­ing” to Fan Bing­bing did not af­fect the Chi­nese ac­tress’ ap­petite.</p>
    <p>Last week, a video of a Chi­nese man who said he was Fan’s loyal fan went vi­ral on Weibo, as he claimed to have 20 mil­lion yuan (S$3.9 mil­lion) and wanted to marry her.</p>
    <p>The mid­dle-aged man, re­port­edly a nou­veau riche, was ridiculed by Chi­nese ne­ti­zens. They said he should take a good look at him­self and that the ac­tress was out of his league.</p>
    <p>Other ne­ti­zens said his wealth was un­likely to at­tract Fan, who topped Forbes’ China Celebrity List in 2017 with es­ti­mated earn­ings of</p>
    <p>300 mil­lion yuan a year.</p>
    <p>Ne­ti­zens later re­ported that the man was fond of pro­duc­ing videos which are ei­ther wacky or re­lated to food.</p>
    <p>Fan, who turns 39 next month, has so far not re­acted to the video. How­ever, on Mon­day night, she posted sev­eral pho­tos of her­self hav­ing din­ner on Weibo with the cap­tion: “Din­ner in sum­mer. A lit­tle bit too full.”</p>
    <p>She looked to be in good spir­its and even winked in one of the im­ages.</p>
    <p>Fan, who last made a cameo ap­pear­ance in the war movie Air Strike (2018), has yet to make a full re­turn to the Chi­nese en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try after she was em­broiled in a tax eva­sion scan­dal in 2018. She broke off with her fi­ance Li Chen in June last year.</p>
