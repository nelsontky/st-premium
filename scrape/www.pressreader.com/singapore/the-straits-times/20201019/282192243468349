    <p>It is dis­ap­point­ing that the Ur­ban Rede­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity (URA) has granted an out­line ap­proval to re­de­velop the 752,015 sq ft Calde­cott Broad­cast Cen­tre site into two-storey bun­ga­lows (Me­di­a­corp’s for­mer Calde­cott Hill home put up for sale, Oct 15).</p>
    <p>Al­low­ing for the de­vel­op­ment of an ex­clu­sive and gated com­mu­nity serves to ac­cen­tu­ate the rich-poor di­vide.</p>
    <p>It was men­tioned that URA may also be pre­pared to con­sider a pro­posal for the site to be re­de­vel­oped into a re­tire­ment vil­lage.</p>
    <p>The con­cept of a re­tire­ment vil­lage has not taken off, and lo­cat­ing it on a hill­top will pose ac­ces­si­bil­ity is­sues for the el­derly. A re­cently pro­posed de­men­tia vil­lage in Sem­bawang also failed to take off, re­ceiv­ing only one bid, which was re­jected as the of­fer price was deemed too low.</p>
    <p>Per­haps in­spi­ra­tion can be drawn from other sim­i­lar hill­top sites. Take, for ex­am­ple, Fort Can­ning with its hill­top capped with a colo­nial-era ser­vice reser­voir. Pearl’s Hill City Park also fea­tures an­other ser­vice reser­voir.</p>
    <p>The hill­top site in Calde­cott can main­tain the cur­rent zon­ing for civic and com­mu­nity in­sti­tu­tion use, cou­pled with the in­cor­po­ra­tion of a size­able park and a ser­vice reser­voir to in­crease Sin­ga­pore’s wa­ter catch­ment as we strive fur­ther to be more self-suf­fi­cient in our wa­ter sourc­ing and needs.</p>
    <p>An­other idea would be to con­sider the site for a sec­ond in­fec­tious dis­eases cen­tre, sur­rounded by lush and size­able park­land, to ex­pand upon the cur­rent suc­cess of the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases.</p>
    <p>The past has shown us that hill­top sites are pre­ferred for hos­pi­tal de­vel­op­ments for ease of disease con­tain­ment and treat­ment. Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal and Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal are both set on top of hills.</p>
    <p>An al­ter­na­tive is to ex­pand the Mount Alver­nia Hos­pi­tal cam­pus lo­cated just across the road as the cur­rent site has reached its de­vel­op­ment po­ten­tial and space con­straints.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties could launch a de­sign com­pe­ti­tion for ideas and to seek lo­cal ar­chi­tec­ture firms’ in­put and cre­ativ­ity to har­ness the max­i­mum po­ten­tial of the site.</p>
    <p>This would be bet­ter than the land owner’s ap­point­ment of its pre­ferred ar­chi­tect to plan out the space for the de­vel­op­ment of good class bun­ga­lows, which ex­cludes any pub­lic en­gage­ment and does noth­ing to bridge the rich-poor di­vide.</p>
