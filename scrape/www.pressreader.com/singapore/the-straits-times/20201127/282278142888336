    <p>The green econ­omy is here al­ready... South-east Asia re­ally needs to be much bolder in its am­bi­tion.</p>
    <p>MR DALE HARDCASTLE, co-au­thor of the re­port and co-di­rec­tor of the Global Sus­tain­abil­ity Innovation Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Go­ing green could bring up to US$1 tril­lion (S$1.3 tril­lion) in an­nual economic ben­e­fits to South-east Asian economies by 2030, a re­port by global man­age­ment con­sult­ing firm Bain and Com­pany said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Greater in­vest­ments in re­new­able en­ergy, re­duced con­sump­tion and bet­ter waste man­age­ment, less dam­ag­ing crop grow­ing prac­tices and im­proved ur­ban plan­ning are among the ar­eas that could bring new growth op­por­tu­ni­ties for economies and greater ef­fi­cien­cies and sav­ings, the au­thors say.</p>
    <p>But change needs to hap­pen quickly as cli­mate change risks grow along with ris­ing threats to the en­vi­ron­ment and hu­man health from de­for­esta­tion, air pol­lu­tion and grow­ing moun­tains of rub­bish, par­tic­u­larly plas­tic waste.</p>
    <p>The re­port, South-East Asia’s Green Econ­omy: Path­way To Full Po­ten­tial, said Asean is at risk of be­ing left be­hind other re­gions, but the good news is that it is wak­ing up to the need to change and could make rapid ad­vances with the right poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Along with the re­port, Bain also launched its Global Sus­tain­abil­ity Innovation Cen­tre (GSIC) in Sin­ga­pore. It aims to ad­vise firms on adapt­ing to a less pol­lut­ing and more ef­fi­cient world.</p>
    <p>“The green econ­omy is here al­ready,” said Mr Dale Hardcastle, co-au­thor of the re­port and co-di­rec­tor of the GSIC. “We strongly be­lieve that South-east Asia re­ally needs to be much bolder in its am­bi­tion,” he told a me­dia round­table.</p>
    <p>Economies around the world have passed ma­jor stim­u­lus pro­grammes to ad­dress the Covid-19 pan­demic and pro­mote “build back bet­ter” ini­tia­tives.</p>
    <p>This is ac­cel­er­at­ing the push to­wards greener in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>While Asean coun­tries have not been fo­cused on green stim­u­lus spend­ing, that is start­ing to change, the au­thors say.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ments are see­ing what other re­gions are do­ing in terms of green stim­u­lus plans, plus mid-cen­tury net-zero emis­sions tar­gets from China, Ja­pan and oth­ers that will drive in­vest­ments away from pol­lut­ing fos­sil fu­els.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers and in­vestors are also putting pres­sure on com­pa­nies to show they are tak­ing action to cut emis­sions and make their op­er­a­tions, ser­vices and prod­ucts less waste­ful.</p>
    <p>The au­thors iden­ti­fied sev­eral ar­eas where green in­vest­ments and poli­cies could yield sig­nif­i­cant fi­nan­cial op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>These in­cluded US$270 bil­lion by shift­ing away from pol­lut­ing fos­sil fu­els, ex­ces­sive ex­trac­tion, over­con­sump­tion and poor waste dis­posal. Ramp­ing up green power gen­er­a­tion, cleaner trans­port, more ef­fi­cient use of re­sources and bet­ter waste man­age­ment and re­cy­cling could create new busi­nesses and jobs, and create large sav­ings.</p>
    <p>Over­haul­ing food pro­duc­tion could yield US$205 bil­lion in ben­e­fits, in­clud­ing ac­cess to bet­ter and more af­ford­able nu­tri­tion, less food waste, more ef­fi­cient and less dam­ag­ing crop pro­duc­tion and far more ef­fi­cient food sup­ply chains.</p>
    <p>“Un­less ad­dressed, in­ac­tion presents a real threat to South-east Asia’s global com­pet­i­tive­ness in the decade ahead,” the au­thors note.</p>
    <p>“In­vestors in­creas­ingly favour com­pa­nies with bet­ter sus­tain­abil­ity stew­ard­ship, while gov­ern­ments are con­sid­er­ing taxes on im­ports from coun­tries with high car­bon foot­prints.”</p>
    <p>Bain’s GSIC, which has been es­tab­lished with the help of the Economic De­vel­op­ment Board, will tap the firm’s ex­per­tise as well as ex­ter­nal part­ners to help com­pa­nies fig­ure out how to make the switch to more sus­tain­able busi­ness prac­tices.</p>
    <p>“In a nut­shell, we’re here to help com­pa­nies solve their sus­tain­abil­ity is­sues, find prac­ti­cal so­lu­tions to them and the right way to fi­nance them,” said Mr Gerry Mat­tios, re­port co-au­thor and GSIC codi­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>Mr Hardcastle said many com­pa­nies are strug­gling with what to do about sus­tain­abil­ity. “But that’s not nec­es­sar­ily neg­a­tive.”</p>
    <p>He said sus­tain­abil­ity lead­ers, such as Mi­crosoft, have set am­bi­tious tar­gets that will stretch their or­gan­i­sa­tions. But he added: “Those com­pa­nies don’t have all the answers and need help.”</p>
    <p>“If we look at many of the com­pa­nies in the re­gion, they want to catch up. They want to learn from global busi­ness lead­ers and how they can make their sus­tain­abil­ity jour­ney faster. So the cen­tre can play a role there,” he said.</p>
