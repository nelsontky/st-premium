    <p>What most peo­ple see as dirty, Mr Ho Lip Teng sees as op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>The busi­ness de­vel­op­ment man­ager, 32, brims with ideas on how the waste sec­tor he works in can be rev­o­lu­tionised with tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Food wastage at gro­cery stores could be re­duced with a sys­tem that orders per­ish­ables only if stocks are run­ning low. Re­cy­cling can be more ef­fi­cient through the use of smart bins that can iden­tify and sort what they are fed.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve there are op­por­tu­ni­ties ev­ery­where,” says Mr Ho, who works in a firm that sup­plies and ser­vices waste man­age­ment equip­ment such as bins and food waste di­gesters.</p>
    <p>And, in­deed, there are. The en­vi­ron­men­tal ser­vice sec­tor – which waste falls un­der – has been pin­pointed by the Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment (MSE) as one area in the sus­tain­abil­ity space which could see more new jobs and up­graded roles over the next decade.</p>
    <p>Deal­ing with waste more ef­fi­ciently, and wring­ing value from ev­ery dreg – such as turn­ing in­cin­er­a­tion bot­tom ash into con­struc­tion ma­te­rial – will put the coun­try in good stead in a re­source-con­strained fu­ture. It would also cre­ate more jobs for pro­fes­sional, man­ager, ex­ec­u­tive and tech­ni­cian (PMET) and rank-and-file roles, or im­prove ex­ist­ing ones, so that the pay is bet­ter, and the work im­proved with tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>As Sin­ga­pore re­cov­ers from the eco­nomic fall­out from the Covid-19 pan­demic, there has been a push to “build back bet­ter”.</p>
    <p>Says a min­istry spokesman: “As MSE con­tin­ues to pur­sue sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment and strengthen Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic, cli­mate and re­source re­silience, there will be op­por­tu­ni­ties for growth in re­lated sec­tors, and the cre­ation of new and up­graded jobs.”</p>
    <p>World­wide, there is a grow­ing view that two crises – the pan­demic and cli­mate change – can be tack­led si­mul­ta­ne­ously by re­build­ing economies that are greener and more re­silient, and cre­at­ing new jobs and less de­struc­tive in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>“I think the ar­rival of this Covid-19 cri­sis has re­ally ex­posed hu­man­ity’s great­est vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties and has mag­ni­fied its most ur­gent chal­lenges,” Ms Pa­tri­cia Espinosa, ex­ec­u­tive sec­re­tary of the United Na­tions Frame­work Con­ven­tion on Cli­mate Change, told The Straits Times ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>Chang­ing weather pat­terns and ex­treme weather events could have sim­i­lar im­pact on the world as Covid-19 – the loss of lives and liveli­hoods, strain on health­care sys­tems and global sup­ply chains, and shat­tered economies.</p>
    <p>The world is still pay­ing the price for this pan­demic. And to avoid sink­ing into na­ture’s debt in the fu­ture, Sin­ga­pore – and the rest of the world – needs a green re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>BRIGHT SPOTS</p>
    <p>Green jobs have been high­lighted in a num­ber of sec­tors: en­vi­ron­men­tal ser­vices, which in­clude waste man­age­ment, pub­lic san­i­ta­tion and vec­tor con­trol; agri-tech; and green build­ings.</p>
    <p>MSE, which over­sees agen­cies in­clud­ing the Sin­ga­pore Food Agency, Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency and na­tional wa­ter agency PUB, says it ex­pects to cre­ate 55,000 new and up­graded jobs over the next 10 years.</p>
    <p>In the en­vi­ron­men­tal ser­vice sec­tor alone, MSE ex­pects close to 50,000 jobs to be cre­ated and up­skilled. For in­stance, clean­ing pro­fes­sion­als will be up­skilled so they can also per­form en­vi­ron­men­tal in­fec­tion con­trol tasks in non-health­care fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“With the en­hanced skill sets, these pro­fes­sion­als will be bet­ter equipped to take on more spe­cialised job roles, with im­proved salaries and ca­reer prospects,” says the MSE spokesman.</p>
    <p>An­other 4,700 jobs could be cre­ated and up­skilled in the agri- and aqua-tech food in­dus­try, she adds.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic hy­giene and food re­silience have al­ways been im­por­tant for Sin­ga­pore. But the coro­n­avirus has high­lighted the ur­gency in en­sur­ing they are done well.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore now pro­duces less than 10 per cent of its own food. The goal is to ramp this up to 30 per cent by 2030, and the Gov­ern­ment wants farm­ers to lever­age tech­nol­ogy to do this.</p>
    <p>One such farmer – if you can call him that – is Mr Ong Shu­jian, 25. Be­neath his soft-spo­ken ex­te­rior is a hard­core am­bi­tion to cre­ate cuts of pork us­ing cell-cul­ture tech­nol­ogy. He co-founded Ants In­no­vate to do just that. The firm – spun off from the Agency of Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search (A*Star) in May this year – spe­cialises in cell-based meat.</p>
    <p>He tells In­sight: “The cur­rent sup­ply chain for meat is spread over a wide foot­print, from rear­ing the an­i­mal in a pad­dock, to ship­ping it to a slaugh­ter­house else­where, and then to some­where else for pro­cess­ing and pack­ag­ing, be­fore be­ing sold at a mar­ket.”</p>
    <p>But grow­ing pig mus­cle cells us­ing cell cul­ture tech­nol­ogy, and then putting these cells onto cel­lu­lar “scaf­fold­ing”, will al­low the firm to be able to pro­duce en­tire cuts of meat, from pork chops to shoul­ders, with a much smaller foot­print, cut­ting down emis­sions from trans­port.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber last year, a study com­mis­sioned by Te­masek found that in Sin­ga­pore, pork ac­counts for the most green­house gas emis­sions from food con­sumed per per­son ev­ery year – even sur­pass­ing emis­sions from beef, blamed glob­ally for be­ing the most car­bon-in­ten­sive meat – due to the sheer amount of pork be­ing con­sumed.</p>
    <p>For Mr Ong, there is an ad­di­tional im­pe­tus for want­ing to de­velop cell-based pork cuts: The ethics of eat­ing an­i­mals reared in fac­tory farm set­tings.</p>
    <p>He had tried go­ing veg­e­tar­ian but, like many who have tried to do so be­fore him, found it dif­fi­cult. “Go­ing veg­e­tar­ian, the im­pact is from one in­di­vid­ual. But by cre­at­ing this prod­uct, the im­pact could be much greater,” he says.</p>
    <p>In this land-scarce coun­try, build­ings now loom where forests once stood. But there is a push now to make the grey cityscape more en­vi­ron­men­tally friendly.</p>
    <p>The Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity projects that 25,000 green pro­fes­sion­als will be re­quired by 2025 for the de­vel­op­ment, de­sign, con­struc­tion, op­er­a­tion and main­te­nance of green build­ings, up from about 20,000 today.</p>
    <p>The cre­ation of jobs in ar­eas that would boost the na­tion’s re­silience against fu­ture shocks, such as cli­mate change, is nec­es­sary. But the ques­tion is: Are they enough for a green re­cov­ery?</p>
    <p>ELE­PHANT IN THE ROOM</p>
    <p>Hu­man ac­tiv­ity, such as the burn­ing of fos­sil fu­els for en­ergy and de­for­esta­tion, are belch­ing heat-trap­ping car­bon diox­ide into the at­mos­phere. With more heat on the planet, Earth’s nat­u­ral sys­tems are thrown out of whack.</p>
    <p>So the great green tran­si­tion must in­clude plans for a car­bon diet. Glob­ally, this is ap­par­ent.</p>
    <p>Ger­many has com­mit­ted €130 bil­lion (S$207 bil­lion) to pan­demic re­cov­ery, with about 30 per cent to be spent on ac­tiv­i­ties that will cut emis­sions, Bloomberg re­ported.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes fed­eral funds for the con­ser­va­tion and sus­tain­able man­age­ment of forests, and in­vest­ing in re­new­able en­ergy.</p>
    <p>Closer to home, the South Korean gov­ern­ment has set aside funds for the re­place­ment of old fos­sil fuel-based util­ity sys­tems with high-ef­fi­ciency green en­ergy ones, and more funds to set up in­fra­struc­ture for the util­i­sa­tion of so­lar, wind and hy­dro­gen en­ergy. What about Sin­ga­pore?</p>
    <p>Dr Vinod Thomas, a for­mer se­nior vice-pres­i­dent of the World Bank and a vis­it­ing pro­fes­sor at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS), says: “Dras­ti­cally low­er­ing the car­bon con­tent of en­ergy is Sin­ga­pore’s green growth im­per­a­tive.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore re­lies largely on nat­u­ral gas – the clean­est form of fos­sil fuel, but a fos­sil fuel none­the­less – for its en­ergy. More­over, the na­tion also has a thriv­ing petro­chem­i­cal sec­tor – the world’s fifth largest when it comes to re­fin­ery ex­ports, says Dr Thomas.</p>
    <p>A third or more of those ex­ports goes to China, he adds. “As China and the world move away from the heavy re­liance on petroleum-based prod­ucts, as they should, Sin­ga­pore could an­tic­i­pate a need to trans­form out of the cur­rent prod­uct mix and tech­nol­ogy,” he tells In­sight.</p>
    <p>There are al­ready signs of this. Shell Sin­ga­pore said ear­lier this month that its 1,300-strong work­force on Pu­lau Bukom will be cut to 1,100 by the end of next year, and to 800 in an­other two years as it piv­ots away from crude oil. It will also be re­duc­ing its crude re­fin­ing ca­pac­ity – to 250,000 bar­rels a day from the cur­rent level of 500,000.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, in­vest­ment is set to in­crease and cre­ate mil­lions of new jobs in the re­new­able en­ergy sec­tor over the rest of the decade, many of those in Asia, says the In­ter­na­tional Re­new­able En­ergy Agency (Irena).</p>
    <p>As at last year, the re­new­able en­ergy sec­tor em­ployed 11.5 mil­lion peo­ple, Irena says, and could em­ploy up to 30 mil­lion by the end of the decade if na­tions re­ally ramp up the green tran­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has rolled out ini­tia­tives that make up a do­mes­tic car­bon diet. These in­clude en­ergy ef­fi­ciency mea­sures, a car­bon tax, and green build­ing and trans­port poli­cies, says Ms Melissa Low, a re­search fel­low at the NUS En­ergy Stud­ies In­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>But in terms of the car­bon it ex­ports, the fu­ture of the en­ergy and chem­i­cals sec­tor – which con­trib­uted 2.3 per cent to Sin­ga­pore’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct last year, and ac­counted for more than $85 bil­lion in to­tal man­u­fac­tur­ing out­put and pro­vided jobs for over 26,000 work­ers – is less clear.</p>
    <p>Mr Damian Chan, ex­ec­u­tive vi­cepres­i­dent of the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board, says the sec­tor in Sin­ga­pore will con­tinue to have an im­por­tant role in our lives, even as the world de­car­bonises.</p>
    <p>“The sec­tor plays a key role in en­abling Sin­ga­pore to meet our cli­mate change goals and our en­ergy tran­si­tion to a low-car­bon econ­omy,” he tells In­sight. Many com­pa­nies in the sec­tor are equipped with re­sources and ca­pa­bil­i­ties to “value-add to Sin­ga­pore’s en­ergy tran­si­tion jour­ney”, he says.</p>
    <p>“These on­go­ing ef­forts in­clude adopt­ing re­new­ables and en­ergy ef­fi­ciency, and pur­su­ing novel so­lu­tions such as car­bon cap­ture, util­i­sa­tion and stor­age, and other low­car­bon en­ergy vec­tors like hy­dro­gen,” he adds.The Gov­ern­ment will con­tinue to part­ner like-minded com­pa­nies in driv­ing in­vest­ments and in­no­va­tion in the en­ergy tran­si­tion, and ex­plore in­vest­ing in new eco­nomic op­por­tu­ni­ties aris­ing from green growth, he says.</p>
    <p>THE WAY FOR­WARD</p>
    <p>MSE agrees that in the l onger term, there will be more promis­ing job and busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>For one thing, as Sin­ga­pore seeks to pro­tect its coast­lines from ris­ing sea lev­els due to melt­ing land ice in a warm­ing planet, cli­mate sci­ence and coastal pro­tec­tion are ar­eas of growth for the Repub­lic.</p>
    <p>The min­istry spokesman says: “Ef­forts to limit the growth of car­bon emis­sions will in­crease the de­mand for en­gi­neer­ing, le­gal and con­sul­tancy ser­vices re­lated to car­bon ser­vices.”</p>
    <p>The car­bon ser­vice sec­tor aims to help firms cut emis­sions, re­duce risks from cli­mate change im­pacts and en­cour­age a shift away from stranded, or car­bon-in­ten­sive, as­sets. It also helps firms man­age their car­bon emis­sions by buy­ing and trad­ing green power cer­tifi­cates and car­bon off­sets gen­er­ated lo­cally or over­seas. In­vestors in so­lar farms, for in­stance, can sell units of the green power to those who want to off­set emis­sions from their own elec­tric­ity use, es­pe­cially if from coal or gas.</p>
    <p>Re­for­esta­tion and for­est preser­va­tion projects that lock away car­bon which might have other­wise been emit­ted are an­other source of car­bon cred­its that help com­pa­nies off­set their own emis­sions.</p>
    <p>In short, car­bon trad­ing and emis­sion re­duc­tion projects, if fully au­dited and ver­i­fied, can boost green in­vest­ment, par­tic­u­larly in de­vel­op­ing na­tions.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor of strate­gic man­age­ment Si­mon Schille­beeckx points to how South-east Asia is home to large swathes of forests, man­groves and peat­lands – all of which are ef­fi­cient and nat­u­ral so­lu­tions that ab­sorb car­bon diox­ide from the at­mos­phere. “There is clearly a need for a fi­nan­cial in­ter­me­di­ary to sup­port the re­for­esta­tion or con­ser­va­tion of such ar­eas,” he says.</p>
    <p>And Sin­ga­pore, with its strong ex­per­tise in fi­nan­cial ser­vices, could play that role, sourc­ing funds from else­where in the world and in­vest­ing them in such projects, he adds. Prof Schille­beeckx is also founder of so­cial en­ter­prise Hand­print Tech that helps firms in­te­grate trees into their sales pro­cesses. “We are look­ing to hire four peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore, do­ing our part for green job cre­ation,” he says.</p>
    <p>The road to re­cov­ery is filled with plans to build back bet­ter. But will they see fruition and are they am­bi­tious enough to set the world on the right track?</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore con­trib­utes 0.11 per cent to global emis­sions. But just as how it showed its might in other sec­tors, so too can the coun­try have an out­size im­pact in help­ing the world avert the harsh­est im­pacts of cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>It took an open mind for Mr Ho, the man­ager in the waste sec­tor, to see the op­por­tu­nity in a field plagued with a strong irk fac­tor.</p>
    <p>Per­haps this open­ness, and will­ing­ness to push the bound­aries, is what is needed from the rest of so­ci­ety to help Sin­ga­pore tran­si­tion into a cleaner, greener fu­ture.</p>
    <p>JOB CRE­ATION</p>
    <p>As MSE con­tin­ues to pur­sue sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment and strengthen Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic, cli­mate and re­source re­silience, there will be op­por­tu­ni­ties for growth in re­lated sec­tors, and the cre­ation of new and up­graded jobs.</p>
