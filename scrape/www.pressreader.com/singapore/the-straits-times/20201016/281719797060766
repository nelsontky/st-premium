    <p>Free Covid-19 test­ing will be of­fered to more than 45,000 stall­hold­ers and their as­sis­tants, clean­ers and food de­liv­ery per­son­nel from now un­til the end of the year as part of ef­forts to con­tain pos­si­ble hid­den cases in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>The one-off test will be con­ducted for in­di­vid­u­als work­ing at 110 hawker cen­tres and mar­kets and more than 1,120 cof­fee shops, as well as food de­liv­ery rid­ers work­ing in those places.</p>
    <p>Test­ing is vol­un­tary, but the work­ers are strongly en­cour­aged to get tested to pro­tect them­selves and their loved ones, the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA), Sin­ga­pore Food Agency (SFA) and En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Start­ing yes­ter­day, more than 2,200 stall­hold­ers, stall as­sis­tants and clean­ers work­ing at 11 hawker cen­tres and mar­kets, and 82 cof­fee shops in Ang Mo Kio GRC, Ke­bun Baru and Yio Chu Kang, as well as food de­liv­ery rid­ers, were slated to be tested.</p>
    <p>The tests will be con­ducted un­til to­day at screen­ing cen­tres set up near the hawker cen­tres and mar­kets.</p>
    <p>To­day, five screen­ing cen­tres – run­ning from 10am to 4pm – will be set up in the Ang Mo Kio area, in­clud­ing Ang Mo Kio Cen­tral Stage and Block 214 Ang Mo Kio Av­enue 3.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cers from NEA and SFA, grass­roots lead­ers as well as hawk­ers’ and mer­chants’ as­so­ci­a­tions have been reach­ing out to the tar­get groups in these ar­eas since last Satur­day. ESG has also in­formed food de­liv­ery com­pa­nies about the test­ing ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>This wider roll-out of test­ing fol­lows a pi­lot swab-test­ing ini­tia­tive con­ducted at some hawker cen­tres, mar­kets and cof­fee shops in Marine Pa­rade last month.</p>
    <p>Be­yond Ang Mo Kio town, NEA is talk­ing to town coun­cils and hawk­ers’ and mer­chants’ as­so­ci­a­tions in other parts of Sin­ga­pore to iden­tify suit­able sites, dates and tim­ings for test­ing.</p>
    <p>The plan is to cover the re­main­ing hawker cen­tres, mar­kets and cof­fee shops be­fore the end of the year, said the three agen­cies.</p>
    <p>Feed­back from those who took the test in Marine Pa­rade will be con­sid­ered for the wider test­ing. These in­clude sched­ul­ing the tests on week­days, when the work­ers will be less busy. The screen­ing cen­tres will also be set up close to each hawker cen­tre and market where pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>In­for­ma­tion on the test sched­ules and lo­ca­tions of up­com­ing screen­ing cen­tres will be pro­vided when ready.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong said last month that the Gov­ern­ment will con­sider ex­pand­ing the test­ing scheme to other groups, in­clud­ing univer­sity stu­dents in hos­tels.</p>
