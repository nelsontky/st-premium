    <p>WHO Ac­tor Li Nanx­ing, who turns 56 to­mor­row , has starred in many Me­di­a­corp drama se­ri­als such as</p>
    <p>The Un­beat­a­bles tril­ogy (1993 to 2002) and The Golden Path (2007), which are at­tract­ing a new gen­er­a­tion of view­ers on Net­flix. He won Best Ac­tor thrice at the Star Awards and was voted one of the Top 10 Most Pop­u­lar Male Artistes 10 years in a row. He is also a good cook and will be col­lab­o­rat­ing with new bak­ery Bak­ers & Co to pair his hae bee hiam (dried shrimp sam­bal) with its crois­sant and his curry chicken with its baguette. The bak­ery will open at Taste Gourmet Mar­ket in Raf­fles Holland V mall in the mid­dle of this month. Li, who is sin­gle, lives alone in a semi-de­tached house in the Holland Road area.</p>
    <p>I stay home on most week­ends these days and cook dishes that my mother and grand­mother whipped up when I was a child. I want to recre­ate the tastes I re­mem­ber and love, but de­spite many at­tempts, I still can’t do it.</p>
    <p>The most dif­fi­cult dish is stewed pork be­cause I don’t know what in­gre­di­ents they put in. Even though what I cook may smell amaz­ing, it still tastes dif­fer­ent from theirs.</p>
    <p>Only my hae bee hiam comes very close be­cause I helped my mum pre­pare the in­gre­di­ents when I was about 10. She was a very good cook and used to sell fried bee­hoon to the army boys who came to the Lim Chu Kang kam­pung we lived in. I helped her wrap the pack­ets.</p>
    <p>When I cook now, I in­vite friends over or pass some of the food to neigh­bours. I also re­pur­pose leftovers, like us­ing them to make nasi ulam.</p>
    <p>I give my­self 50 points out of 100 for my cook­ing. It’s not per­fect, but friends en­joy it.</p>
    <p>I like to cook new dishes but can’t han­dle too many types of cuisines, es­pe­cially West­ern cook­ing. I pre­fer Chi­nese food be­cause it comes nat­u­rally to me.</p>
    <p>Some­times I go to the Ghim Moh wet mar­ket to get fresh items. Many of the stall­hold­ers there recog­nise me and will call me over to their stalls. So I of­ten come home with 10 things when I want to buy only one item.</p>
    <p>I en­joy vis­it­ing the wet mar­ket be­cause I will browse and come up with ideas of what to cook with what I see there. I like the process of turn­ing in­gre­di­ents into a de­li­cious dish, like com­ing up with an orig­i­nal recipe for a spicy crab dish.</p>
    <p>My lat­est at­tempt is cook­ing sup kamb­ing</p>
    <p>(Malay mut­ton soup) be­cause my favourite stalls sell­ing it are gone. But I haven’t suc­ceeded yet. If there is too much spice, the taste is too strong; too lit­tle and there’s not enough flavour. And if it’s boiled for too long, the soup be­comes sticky.</p>
    <p>But I’m not giv­ing up.</p>
