    <p>SHANG­HAI • Asian com­pa­nies ac­counted for al­most half of the global stock of­fer­ing haul in the first half of this year, with the three big­gest deals all com­ing from the re­gion, as sec­ond list­ings by Chi­nese busi­nesses boosted vol­umes.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies in Asia raised US$46.2 bil­lion (S$64.2 bil­lion) through ini­tial share sales in the first six months of this year, rep­re­sent­ing 49 per cent of the US$93.9 bil­lion fetched glob­ally, data com­piled by Bloomberg shows.</p>
    <p>That is the high­est pro­por­tion for the first half of a year in the last decade, the data shows, un­der­scor­ing Asia’s ris­ing share of eq­uity cap­i­tal mar­kets ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese com­pa­nies ac­counted for most of Asia’s list­ings in the sec­ond quar­ter, as the world’s sec­ond­largest econ­omy emerged from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic sooner than other parts of the world.</p>
    <p>The grow­ing trend of US-traded Chi­nese com­pa­nies seek­ing to list closer to home amid ris­ing global trade ten­sions also con­trib­uted to the height­ened ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>“The re­sponse to Covid-19 in Asia and the quick ac­tions taken helped un­der­pin in­vestor con­fi­dence,” said Mr Ken­neth Chow, co­head of eq­uity cap­i­tal mar­kets for Asia at Cit­i­group.</p>
    <p>“We’re see­ing a stream of health­care and biotech com­pa­nies get­ting listed in Hong Kong. The val­u­a­tions have gone up, so they’re com­ing to the mar­ket.”</p>
    <p>Biotech firms were some of the only com­pa­nies com­plet­ing IPOs (ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ings) when the eq­uity mar­ket was slump­ing in March, with the sec­tor emerg­ing as a win­ner from the pan­demic, driven by higher de­mand for health­care.</p>
    <p>Asian health­care, phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal and biotech com­pa­nies raised US$8.6 bil­lion through list­ings in the first half, al­most as much as what was fetched in all of last year.</p>
    <p>Boost­ing Asia’s share of global list­ing vol­umes is also the fact that Euro­pean and United States com­pa­nies raised less money through ini­tial share sales than a year ago, as economies in those re­gions were pum­melled by strict lock­downs.</p>
    <p>First-time share sales by Euro­pean com­pa­nies slumped 50 per cent in the first half, while those by Amer­i­can firms de­clined 13 per cent, ac­cord­ing to Bloomberg-com­piled data.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, Asian firms raised 54 per cent more than last year through IPOs and sec­ond list­ings.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, the top three list­ings of the first half were by Chi­nese com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>JD.com was the largest, rais­ing US$4.46 bil­lion in its Hong Kong share sale. It was fol­lowed by Bei­jing-Shang­hai High Speed Rail­way, which fetched US$4.34 bil­lion on Shang­hai’s Nas­daq-style Star board in Jan­uary, and NetEase, which com­pleted a US$3.13 bil­lion sec­ond list­ing in Hong Kong last month.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies from Asia tend to dom­i­nate list­ing ac­tiv­ity in the sec­ond half of the year, ac­count­ing for an av­er­age of 53 per cent of global vol­umes in July to De­cem­ber over the past decade, data shows.</p>
    <p>In the sec­ond half of last year, Asian com­pa­nies made up 52 per cent of stock list­ing pro­ceeds, helped by Alibaba Group Hold­ing’s US$13 bil­lion deal in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond half of this year is al­ready off to a strong start for Asian com­pa­nies, with China’s Semi­con­duc­tor Man­u­fac­tur­ing In­ter­na­tional set to raise as much as US$7.5 bil­lion in the world’s largest list­ing, year to date.</p>
