    <p>Real es­tate de­vel­oper and man­ager Frasers Prop­erty has posted a 66.4 per cent drop in net profit to $188.1 mil­lion for the full year end­ing Sept 30.</p>
    <p>The drop from $560.3 mil­lion a year ago came as earn­ings were hit by the Covid-19 pan­demic, the main­board-listed group said in a reg­u­la­tory fil­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Earn­ings per share af­ter fair value change and ex­cep­tional items stood at 3.81 cents for the full year, down from 15.94 cents in the pre­ced­ing year.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue slipped 5.1 per cent to $3.6 bil­lion, from $3.79 bil­lion a year ear­lier. Mean­while, profit be­fore in­ter­est, fair value change, tax­a­tion and ex­cep­tional items fell 3.6 per cent on the year to $1.25 bil­lion, from $1.29 bil­lion last year.</p>
    <p>Frasers Prop­erty said the pan­demic brought about world­wide ho­tel clo­sures, gov­ern­ment-im­posed move­ment re­stric­tions and tem­po­rary ces­sa­tions of non-es­sen­tial ser­vices, which ad­versely af­fected op­er­a­tions of the group’s hos­pi­tal­ity and re­tail prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the group ex­tended rental re­bates mainly to its re­tail ten­ants and recorded lower con­tri­bu­tions from de­vel­op­ment projects in Aus­tralia and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Th­ese de­creases were par­tially off­set by higher con­tri­bu­tions from Asi­aRe­tail Fund and Golden Land Prop­erty De­vel­op­ment, fol­low­ing the group’s step-up ac­qui­si­tion and con­sol­i­da­tion of their re­sults, Frasers Prop­erty noted.</p>
    <p>The board has rec­om­mended a fi­nal div­i­dend of 1.5 cents per share for FY20, com­pared with six cents per share for FY19. This is in view of the pan­demic’s im­pact on earn­ings and in keep­ing with the group’s con­ser­va­tion of fi­nan­cial re­sources given the un­cer­tain­ties ahead, Frasers Prop­erty said.</p>
    <p>Sub­ject to share­hold­ers’ ap­proval, the div­i­dend is to be paid on Feb 10 next year.</p>
    <p>The group said the out­look for its var­i­ous busi­nesses will con­tinue to re­main chal­leng­ing in the months ahead and will have an im­pact on its rev­enue and earn­ings.</p>
    <p>It added that the full im­pact of the pan­demic can­not be as­cer­tained at this stage as the sit­u­a­tion is still evolv­ing and af­fected by un­cer­tain­ties.</p>
