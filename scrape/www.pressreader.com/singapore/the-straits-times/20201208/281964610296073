    <p>Some time later this month, Ja­pan will re­lease the first es­ti­mate of births and deaths for this year – an an­nual gift from the Health Min­istry that ar­rives around Dec 25 with all the sea­sonal joy of a bro­ken boiler.</p>
    <p>For the past 13 years, this re­lease has de­liv­ered ev­i­dence of Ja­pan’s shrink­ing indige­nous pop­u­la­tion and its dark­en­ing de­mo­graphic shadow via a se­ries of bleak mile­stones. Th­ese seem all the starker for their stub­born re­sis­tance to rem­edy and for the cau­tion­ary road map they pro­vide the out­side world.</p>
    <p>By 2008 – one year af­ter the great in­flec­tion from growth to de­cline – deaths in Ja­pan out­num­bered births by just over 50,000. By 2019, that im­bal­ance had in­creased to more than half a mil­lion. In 2016, the pop­u­la­tion de­creased at an av­er­age rate of 1,000 per day. Based on monthly num­bers, 2020 is on tra­jec­tory for a pos­si­ble shrink­age rate equiv­a­lent to 1,500 per day, or one per­son per minute.</p>
    <p>As per tra­di­tion, Ja­pan’s me­dia will greet this by as­sem­bling ex­perts to shake their heads and wring their hands. But for</p>
    <p>Ja­panese view­ers, both young and old, it is all gloomy non-news. They may not rel­ish it, but the pop­u­lace, whose pop­u­lar books in­clude En­joy­ing Nurs­ing Care, has al­ready struck a bit­ter peace with re­al­ity.</p>
    <p>The au­di­ence that re­ally mat­ters – in a coun­try where birth rates fell to a 70-year low last year and of­fi­cials of­ten high­light “warn­ing lines” on fertility rates – is China.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion for Bei­jing is not how wor­ried to be, but rather when the weight of de­mo­graphic con­cern makes it­self felt.</p>
    <p>Along the road of age­ing and pop­u­la­tion de­cline, there are some un­ex­pected mo­ments of ben­e­fit: Ja­pan’s job-to-ap­pli­cant rate, for ex­am­ple, has stayed above 1.0 this year, de­spite Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Yet, an aged pop­u­la­tion is noth­ing to look for­ward to. There are also im­por­tant dif­fer­ences in what brought the two coun­tries to their de­mo­graphic present: China’s 1979 one-child pol­icy is prime among them. Even so, Ja­pan’s ex­pe­ri­ence is in­struc­tive.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s lat­est Health Min­istry num­bers will con­firm a phe­nom­e­non whose ef­fects are now plain but that have been the sub­ject of warn­ing for over a quar­ter of a cen­tury. From gi­ant type­faces on menus, to empty schools be­ing razed to build care homes, daily life teems with mun­dane ex­am­ples where Ja­pan’s phys­i­cal fab­ric is chang­ing.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses, fam­i­lies and the pub­lic sec­tor must adapt to hav­ing al­most 29 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion aged over 65 and a re­lent­lessly shrink­ing work­force to sup­port them.</p>
    <p>Changes to the macro fab­ric – such as a his­toric risk re­bal­anc­ing by pen­sion funds, or a surge in out­bound ac­qui­si­tions – can also re­ver­ber­ate glob­ally.</p>
    <p>For China, where the over-65s ra­tio stood at 11.9 per cent last year, a Ja­panese-style de­mo­graphic fate may seem dis­tant. But China’s ra­tio is ris­ing more rapidly than it did in Ja­pan and some pro­jec­tions sug­gest it will hit 25 per cent in about 15 years.</p>
    <p>The crit­i­cal death-birth cross­over that Ja­pan ex­pe­ri­enced in 2007 will, on cur­rent pro­jec­tions, hap­pen in China a decade from now.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s les­son is that real peril lies in the ex­pec­ta­tion of pain. In the more than 30 years since the burst­ing of Ja­pan’s stock mar­ket and prop­erty bub­ble, there has evolved a spec­trum of the­o­ries about the eco­nomic land­scape that formed in its af­ter­math: for some, a per­ma­nently half-baked flir­ta­tion with re­cov­ery; for oth­ers, a rea­son­ably man­aged de­cline with dig­nity.</p>
    <p>Less in doubt is that there has never since been any real sense that Ja­pan will ever sus­tain­ably re­cap­ture the op­ti­mism and eupho­ria that once acted upon the coun­try as such a pow­er­ful pro­pel­lant.</p>
    <p>Re­cent days have been a re­minder of that. Any cel­e­bra­tion of the Nikkei 225 stock mar­ket in­dex hit­ting a 29-year high last week was tem­pered by the fact that it is still a third be­low the 1989 peak.</p>
    <p>There are many rea­sons for this, but de­mo­graph­ics are surely cen­tral: once the idea beds in that pop­u­la­tion de­cline is in­ex­orable, it is dif­fi­cult to look out at the eco­nomic hori­zon and see, as Ja­pan once did, in­fi­nite pos­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s fertility rate fell to 1.5 the year af­ter the bub­ble burst in 1990; five years later the work­ing-age pop­u­la­tion be­gan to fall. By 1997, de­mog­ra­phers were pre­dict­ing that the cross­over into over­all pop­u­la­tion de­cline would come a decade on – as it duly did.</p>
    <p>China faces a sim­i­lar se­ries of mile­stones over the next 30 years. The dou­ble chal­lenge is not only to pre­pare the econ­omy for the prac­ti­cal ef­fects of pop­u­la­tion de­cline and age­ing, but to find ways to be op­ti­mistic in their shadow.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s lat­est Health Min­istry num­bers will con­firm a phe­nom­e­non whose ef­fects are now plain but that have been the sub­ject of warn­ing for over a quar­ter of a cen­tury. From gi­ant type­faces on menus, to empty schools be­ing razed to build care homes, daily life teems with mun­dane ex­am­ples where Ja­pan’s phys­i­cal fab­ric is chang­ing.</p>
