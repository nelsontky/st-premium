    <p>• The United Na­tions World Food Pro­gramme (WFP) will need to raise US$6.8 bil­lion (S$9.2 bil­lion) over the next six months to avert famine amid the Covid-19 cri­sis, the agency said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The WFP, which was awarded the No­bel Peace Prize last week for its ef­forts to pre­vent the use of hunger as a weapon of war and con­flict, said it had so far raised US$1.6 bil­lion (S$2.17 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>“We’ve got a lot more money to raise to make cer­tain we avert famine,” Mr David Beasley, ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of the WFP, said at a con­fer­ence or­gan­ised by the UN’s Food and Agri­cul­ture Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Beasley also noted that seven mil­lion peo­ple had died from hunger this year as the Covid-19 pan­demic, which could dou­ble hunger world­wide, claimed a fur­ther one mil­lion lives.</p>
    <p>“If we don’t sort out Covid, (the) hunger death rate could be three, four, five times that,” said Mr Beasley.</p>
    <p>The Rome-based WFP says it helps some 97 mil­lion peo­ple in about 88 coun­tries each year, and that one in nine peo­ple world­wide still does not have enough to eat.</p>
    <p>Af­ter de­clin­ing for sev­eral decades, world hunger has been on the rise again since 2016, driven by the twin scourges of con­flict and cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>“If you think about the wealth on Earth to­day, we shouldn’t see one sin­gle child (go) hun­gry or die from star­va­tion,” said Mr Beasley.</p>
    <p>The WFP has dis­patched med­i­cal car­goes to over 120 coun­tries dur­ing the pan­demic, and pro­vided pas­sen­ger ser­vices to ferry hu­man­i­tar­ian work­ers in cases where com­mer­cial flights were un­avail­able.</p>
    <p>The agency, the world’s largest hu­man­i­tar­ian or­gan­i­sa­tion, is funded en­tirely by do­na­tions. It pro­vides school meals to 17.3 mil­lion chil­dren glob­ally and de­liv­ered 4.2 mil­lion tonnes of food to re­gions or coun­tries in need in 2019.</p>
