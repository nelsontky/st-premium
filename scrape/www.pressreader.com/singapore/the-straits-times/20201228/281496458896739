    <p>The world may be in the throes of a pan­demic, but for Sin­ga­porean master pot­ter Iskan­dar Jalil, the art-mak­ing car­ries on.</p>
    <p>He turns 81 next week, but still rides a mo­tor­bike to his stu­dio in Te­masek Polytech­nic nearly every day. Last week, he opened a solo ex­hi­bi­tion of his new­est works.</p>
    <p>Awak­en­ing, the ti­tle of the show at Ion Art Gallery, opened on Christ­mas Day with more than 80 works mostly from the past two years. It is or­gan­ised by Tem­busu Art Gallery and cu­rated by in­de­pen­dent cu­ra­tor Syed Muhd Hafiz.</p>
    <p>Among the works are Let The Sleep­ing Dogs Lie, a 2.8m-long, 150kg series of sin­u­ous forms mounted on Mer­bau wood; and Where Is My Kam­pong?, a stoneware ves­sel bear­ing the names of old kam­pungs and dis­played along with some seem­ingly bro­ken frag­ments.</p>
    <p>There is also Dor­mi­tory, a re­sponse to the spread of Covid-19 in the ac­com­mo­da­tion of mi­grant work­ers here; and Lit­tle Dragon, which in­cor­po­rates drift­wood that he picked up on New Zealand’s coast a decade ago.</p>
    <p>Iskan­dar’s stu­dio lies on the edge of Te­masek Polytech­nic, where he worked till his re­tire­ment in 1999. The Cul­tural Medal­lion re­cip­i­ent does not teach much any­more, although he has been groom­ing sev­eral adult dis­ci­ples.</p>
    <p>When this re­porter meets him at his stu­dio, he is stand­ing out­side the en­trance, busy han­dling wet clay in a basin.</p>
    <p>“I am re­claim­ing re­jected pots,” he says. “Pots that are not good, we re­ject them and put them in wa­ter. The pots will dis­in­te­grate and, to­mor­row morn­ing, I will get my clay again.”</p>
    <p>The artist, who stresses the im­por­tance of dis­ci­pline and prop­erly un­der­stand­ing one’s ma­te­rial, goes to his stu­dio nearly every day. He gets there on his Yamaha mo­tor­bike or by tak­ing a 1½-hour walk from his home in Kem­ban­gan. He of­ten stays for the whole day, some­times till late.</p>
    <p>“Fir­ing takes two days, one night.</p>
    <p>It’s tir­ing, you miss your sleep,” says Iskan­dar, who uses a gas-fired kiln to fire his clay works be­cause the elec­tric ones are “very dull”.</p>
    <p>“With an elec­tric kiln, you get what you ex­pect. If you have cobalt ox­ide, it gives you blue. If you use gas, the blue will have cer­tain nu­ances, changes, dif­fer­ences, that’s the beauty of it,” adds the for­mer math­e­mat­ics and science teacher, who makes his own colours.</p>
    <p>The airy stu­dio, filled with ce­ramic pieces, has sev­eral signs on the wall. “Make this work­shop your home”, reads one. “Poor & shoddy work will be thrown into the clay bin prior to fir­ing”, warns an­other.</p>
    <p>Iskan­dar’s works re­flect the Ja­panese aes­thetic of wabi sabi, which finds beauty in im­per­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>“A per­fect pot is very easy to make. But to get it im­per­fect and good to the eye, that’s very rare. There is im­per­fec­tion when you want to make some­thing per­fectly round, but some­thing hap­pens – the wheel spins too fast or you put your hand like that and it caves in.”</p>
    <p>He wears a blue T-shirt with the words Mt Fuji on them. He has a deep af­fec­tion for Ja­pan, where he stud­ied ce­ram­ics on a Colombo Plan schol­ar­ship and fell in love with the craft.</p>
    <p>He speaks of his ad­mi­ra­tion for ce­ramic artists in Ja­panese vil­lages, such as the late Shoji</p>
    <p>Ha­mada, a ma­jor fig­ure of the mingei folk craft move­ment of the early 1900s.</p>
    <p>At the pot­ter’s wheel, the ease of Iskan­dar’s deft move­ments re­flects decades of ex­pe­ri­ence. He dips his fin­gers into blue pig­ment and colours the clay with it. Later, af­ter the round ves­sel has taken shape, he puts his hands in and widens its lips, like a smile.</p>
    <p>“I do what the clay can do for me – not what I think I should do,” says the artist, whose palms are smooth from years of clay-mak­ing.</p>
    <p>He re­calls that dur­ing his teach­ing days, he would hurl stu­dents’ works off the third-floor para­pet when they were not up to stan­dard. Some were “too per­fect”,</p>
    <p>oth­ers failed to re­spect the ma­te­rial they were us­ing.</p>
    <p>“You talk to them, they will lis­ten, but they for­get. Pun­ish them that way and they’ll re­mem­ber that till they grow old.”</p>
    <p>The ti­tle of the cur­rent ex­hi­bi­tion, orig­i­nally slated to run in Au­gust, is Awak­en­ing. “It dawned on me that I’m no longer young,” says the prostate cancer sur­vivor.</p>
    <p>For now, the work goes on. “A pot­ter will never stop. He’ll con­tinue on and on and on... as long as my legs can carry me on the walk from my home to my stu­dio, as long as my hands are strong and can do the work.”</p>
