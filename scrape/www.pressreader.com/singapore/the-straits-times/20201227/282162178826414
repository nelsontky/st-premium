    <p>JAS­MINE SOKKO, 25 Singer and song­writer</p>
    <p>The elec­tronic pop singer, song­writer and pro­ducer started off 2020 with a bang.</p>
    <p>She had just been crowned Best South-east Asia Act at the MTV Europe Music Awards in Spain in Novem­ber last year. Then the pan­demic hap­pened.</p>
    <p>But the fa­mously masked singer did not let it put the brakes on her ris­ing music ca­reer.</p>
    <p>She forged full speed ahead with new ven­tures and mak­ing an im­pact in both the English and Chi­nese music mar­kets, hence earn­ing a spot in this year’s Life Power List.</p>
    <p>The bilin­gual singer ex­panded her re­gional reach with her first Mandarin EP, Made In Fu­ture, re­leased by ma­jor record label Warner Music’s China wing. It in­cludes a high-pro­file col­lab­o­ra­tion with one of China’s most prom­i­nent rap­pers, Vava, on the fe­male em­pow­er­ment track Girls.</p>
    <p>With travel out of the ques­tion, most of the work for the EP took place on­line with pro­duc­ers and di­rec­tors from coun­tries such as Swe­den, Canada and China.</p>
    <p>It was ironic, she notes, that the songs are about “break­ing out of an il­lu­sion­ary dig­i­tal world we all live in”.</p>
    <p>“Son­i­cally, I see this EP as a var­ied palate of ex­pe­ri­ence of dif­fer­ent styles and sounds. I used to make very co­he­sive music, but for once, I just want to ac­cept that I am a mul­ti­di­men­sional per­son ca­pa­ble of lik­ing more than one type of sound.”</p>
    <p>She played live-stream gigs in ma­jor on­line events such as Zouk Phuturesca­pes, a vir­tual party span­ning three time zones that fea­tured global elec­tronic dance music stars such as Amer­i­can DJ Diplo.</p>
    <p>On music stream­ing ser­vice</p>
    <p>Spo­tify’s list of most lis­tened to Sin­ga­pore artists this year, she ranked fifth, be­hind far more sea­soned re­gional stars such as JJ Lin and Stefanie Sun.</p>
    <p>“In a strange year like 2020, the most trans­for­ma­tive mo­ments hap­pened be­tween when you are try­ing to adapt to changes and learn­ing how to live and work in what peo­ple have deemed as ‘the new nor­mal’,” she muses.</p>
    <p>“It turns out we are all pretty re­silient and that’s some­thing worth cel­e­brat­ing.”</p>
    <p>She has big ad­ven­tur­ous plans for next year, in­clud­ing launch­ing a new EP, this time with English songs, with in­ter­na­tional col­lab­o­ra­tors. “I’m cur­rently work­ing with new folks that bring so much new en­ergy and per­spec­tives for my new English EP.”</p>
    <p>She scored a coup by en­list­ing Grammy-nom­i­nated Canadian artist Jenna An­drews to be her ex­ec­u­tive pro­ducer. An­drews is known for her work on one of 2020’s global break­out pop songs, Su­palonely, by New Zealand singer Be­nee. She also pro­duced the vo­cals on one of the big­gest hits of 2020, Dy­na­mite, by K-pop stars BTS.</p>
