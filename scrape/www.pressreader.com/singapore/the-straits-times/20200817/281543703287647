    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans have learnt over time to bet­ter ad­just to work­ing from home, as new sur­vey data showed that over­all pro­duc­tiv­ity among em­ploy­ees has in­creased grad­u­ally from April to June. The sur­vey by em­ployee en­gage­ment plat­form En­gageRocket found that about 23 per cent in June said they were more pro­duc­tive work­ing from home, up from 15 per cent in April.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans have l earnt over time to bet­ter ad­just to work­ing from home, as new sur­vey data shows that over­all pro­duc­tiv­ity among em­ploy­ees grad­u­ally in­creased from April to June.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a sur­vey by em­ployee en­gage­ment plat­form En­gageRocket that had 20,000 re­spon­dents from 127 com­pa­nies across var­i­ous sec­tors, about 23 per cent said in June that they were more pro­duc­tive work­ing from home than when they worked in the of­fice be­fore the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>This num­ber was up from the 15 per cent in April, when the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod had just be­gun and em­ploy­ees were start­ing to work from home.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong Chee Tung, co­founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of En­gageRocket, said: “Pro­duc­tiv­ity lev­els in­creased be­tween the start of the cir­cuit breaker and phase two, re­flect­ing the way lead­ers (of com­pa­nies) are suc­cess­fully re­spond­ing to this cri­sis.”</p>
    <p>He added: “Our study paints a re­mark­able pic­ture of the re­silience and adapt­abil­ity of Sin­ga­pore’s work­ers.”</p>
    <p>The re­port, re­leased last week, was con­ducted in part­ner­ship with the Sin­ga­pore Hu­man Re­sources In­sti­tute and the In­sti­tute for Hu­man Re­source Pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>De­spite the grad­ual im­prove­ment in pro­duc­tiv­ity, chal­lenges in re­mote work per­sist for some em­ploy­ees. These in­clude space con­straints at home or dis­trac­tions from fam­ily mem­bers, and they can cause high lev­els of stress for work­ers.</p>
    <p>“Even in the best of times, pro­longed work­ing from home is linked to harm­ful im­pacts on men­tal well-be­ing,” said the re­port.</p>
    <p>The men­tal-health im­pact is not the same across all sec­tors, how­ever.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the fi­nance and tech­nol­ogy sec­tors, which rely largely on a desked work­force who can more eas­ily work re­motely, had em­ploy­ees who were l ess likely to be stressed. Eleven per cent of work­ers in fi­nance said that their stress lev­els were un­ac­cept­able, while 17 per cent of work­ers at tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies said the same.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the ed­u­ca­tion sec­tor had the big­gest pro­por­tion of work­ers – 30 per cent – who said their stress l evels while work­ing re­motely were un­ac­cept­able. This was most likely linked to un­cer­tain­ties dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker when schools were shut and had to move to full home-based learn­ing.</p>
    <p>Even after re­stric­tions were lifted and schools started open­ing in phases, 23 per cent of those work­ing in ed­u­ca­tion said they had un­ac­cept­able lev­els of stress, still the high­est across all sec­tors sur­veyed.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey also found that 40 per cent of em­ploy­ees who are par­ents said they felt stressed while work­ing from home – dou­ble the over­all av­er­age.</p>
    <p>Among the rea­sons for par­ents’ stress lev­els are the need to work longer hours than usual, fam­ily pres­ence and space con­straints, and hav­ing to at­tend to their chil­dren’s home-based learn­ing as­sign­ments.</p>
    <p>Telecom­mut­ing re­mains the de­fault mode of work for all com­pa­nies, ac­cord­ing to Min­istry of Man­power guide­lines. Em­ploy­ees should go to the of­fice only when nec­es­sary, or to ful­fil le­gal re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>How­ever, at some com­pa­nies, em­ploy­ees have asked if they could re­turn to the work­place.</p>
    <p>At cloud-based soft­ware com­pany Deskera, some work­ers “can’t wait” for the virus sit­u­a­tion to get bet­ter so that they can go back to the of­fice, said chief ex­ec­u­tive Shashank Dixit.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that there is no ad­e­quate vir­tual re­place­ment for phys­i­cal of­fice in­ter­ac­tions, he said: “For some peo­ple, it’s also a so­cial need, be­cause peo­ple who are used to work­ing in teams can some­times feel like they are work­ing in si­los when at home, and feel a lit­tle lost.”</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ees at pub­lic re­la­tions agency PRe­cious Com­mu­ni­ca­tions have also re­quested that they be al­lowed to re­turn to the work­place, cit­ing rea­sons such as the num­ber of house­hold mem­bers at home and poor In­ter­net con­nec­tions.</p>
    <p>Man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Lars Voedisch said that the com­pany gave each of its 30 em­ploy­ees a nom­i­nal bud­get of $100 to up­grade their home of­fice set-up, such as by buy­ing a more com­fort­able chair.</p>
    <p>He said: “While we try to be sup­port­ive and un­der­stand­ing, we are strictly ad­her­ing to the over­all guide­lines, with work-from-home be­ing the sta­tus quo for the time be­ing.”</p>
    <p>The re­port added that com­pa­nies should look into the men­tal wellness of their work­ers, be­cause “mov­ing for­ward, em­ploy­ees’ pri­or­i­ties are sure to shift” amid the pan­demic. This is be­yond the ini­tial con­cerns over ba­sic dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion of pro­cesses just to be able to get work done.</p>
    <p>At Soft­ware AG, which has about 50 em­ploy­ees here, lead­ers reg­u­larly check in with their staff to chat about things out­side of work.</p>
    <p>Mind­ful of the stress that can come from work­ing overly long hours, the com­pany’s man­agers also lead by ex­am­ple by mak­ing it a point to go off­line at 6pm and avoid­ing work e-mails after hours.</p>
    <p>Ms An­neliese Schulz, Soft­ware AG’s pres­i­dent for Asia-Pa­cific and Ja­pan, said: “The tran­si­tion to work­ing from home has been smooth for us, with no im­pact to pro­duc­tiv­ity. Our fo­cus has shifted now to en­sur­ing that we en­cour­age peo­ple to watch their work­ing times and pro­tect them­selves from feel­ing over­whelmed.”</p>
    <p>Over at tech giant Google, em­ploy­ees can ac­cess a free and con­fi­den­tial ser­vice, 24 hours a day, to re­ceive coun­selling over the phone. The com­pany also has its own men­tal health aware­ness group, com­pris­ing em­ployee vol­un­teers who pro­vide sup­port for peers should they need it.</p>
    <p>Said the En­gageRocket re­port: “In a so­cially dis­tant world, many man­agers lack the time and tools they need to ef­fec­tively iden­tify flight risk, burnout or dis­en­gage­ment. Lead­ers need to help them un­der­stand how their team feels and track progress.”</p>
