    <p>MOSCOW • Rus­sia’s Sput­nik V vac­cine is 92 per cent ef­fec­tive at pro­tect­ing peo­ple from Covid-19 ac­cord­ing to in­terim trial re­sults, the coun­try’s sov­er­eign wealth fund said yes­ter­day, as Moscow rushes to keep pace with Western drug­mak­ers in the race for a shot.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia’s re­sults are only the sec­ond from a lat­estage hu­man trial, fol­low­ing on swiftly from data re­leased on Mon­day by Pfizer and BioNTech, which said their shot was also more than 90 per cent ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>While ex­perts said the Rus­sian data was en­cour­ag­ing and re­in­forced the idea the pan­demic could be halted by vac­cines, they warned that the re­sults were based only on a small num­ber of trial vol­un­teers who had con­tracted Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The anal­y­sis was con­ducted af­ter 20 par­tic­i­pants de­vel­oped the virus and ex­am­ined how many had re­ceived the vac­cine ver­sus a placebo. That is sig­nif­i­cantly lower than the 94 in­fec­tions in the trial of the vac­cine by Pfizer and BioNTech.</p>
    <p>“I as­sume there was po­lit­i­cal pres­sure af­ter the press re­lease from Pfizer and BioNTech ear­lier in the week to now draw level with their own data,” said Mr Bodo Plachter, deputy di­rec­tor of the In­sti­tute of Virol­ogy at the Mainz Uni­ver­sity. “What is miss­ing for now is an anal­y­sis of sta­tis­ti­cal sig­nif­i­cance.”</p>
    <p>To con­firm the ef­fi­cacy rate of its vac­cine, Pfizer said it would con­tinue its trial un­til there were 164 Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>The Rus­sian Di­rect In­vest­ment Fund, which has been back­ing Sput­nik V’s de­vel­op­ment, said the Rus­sian trial would con­tinue for six months. Mr Alexan­der Gints­burg, di­rec­tor of the Ga­ma­leya In­sti­tute which de­vel­oped the vac­cine, said the in­terim re­sults demon­strated that Sput­nik V was ef­fec­tive and mass vac­ci­na­tions would be rolled out in Rus­sia in the com­ing weeks.</p>
    <p>Vac­cines are seen as cru­cial to restor­ing daily life around the world by help­ing end the pan­demic that has killed more than 1.26 mil­lion peo­ple, shut­tered busi­nesses and put mil­lions out of work.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts said knowl­edge about the Rus­sian trial’s de­sign was sparse, mak­ing it hard to in­ter­pret the data. The Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine uses mes­sen­ger RNA tech­nol­ogy and is de­signed to trig­ger an im­mune re­sponse with­out us­ing pathogens such as ac­tual virus par­ti­cles.</p>
