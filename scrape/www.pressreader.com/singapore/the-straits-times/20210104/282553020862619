    <p>Net­baller Talisha Michelle Savaridas had dreamt of win­ning the Na­tional School Games (NSG) A Di­vi­sion ti­tle when she was ac­cepted into An­glo-Chi­nese Ju­nior Col­lege (ACJC) – net­ball cham­pi­ons for 2018 and 2019 – through the Di­rect School Ad­mis­sion (DSA) scheme two years ago.</p>
    <p>But Talisha, now a JC2 stu­dent, is star­ing at a sec­ond straight year of not com­pet­ing in the an­nual school com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>For the first time in its 61-year his­tory, the NSG was can­celled last year – af­ter it was sus­pended twice – ow­ing to the Covid-19 pan­demic. While the Games will re­sume this year, eight team sports – cricket, foot­ball, hockey, net­ball, rugby, soft­ball, vol­ley­ball and wa­ter polo – have been benched for now as they “do not meet the na­tional guide­lines”, said the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE). Judo has also been omit­ted from the NSG.</p>
    <p>Other team sports like bas­ket­ball and floor­ball have been mod­i­fied to ad­here to the lat­est Covid-19 guide­lines that limit sports ac­tiv­i­ties to groups of eight peo­ple. The com­pe­ti­tions for the two sports will be held in 3v3 for­mats.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there is still hope for stu­dent-ath­letes like Talisha as the MOE said in its press state­ment last month that it is “work­ing on how these sports can re­sume safely for NSG 2021”.</p>
    <p>The NSG, which typ­i­cally runs from Jan­uary to Au­gust, sees about 60,000 stu­dent-ath­letes com­pet­ing across 29 sports.</p>
    <p>Talisha, 17, said: “I came in last year with the in­ten­tion that I’m go­ing to play in the A Di­vi­sion and we’re go­ing to win, but no one ex­pected Covid to hit. None­the­less, I still had some hope that it was go­ing to die down sooner or later, but it hasn’t and I don’t think we’ll be play­ing this year.</p>
    <p>“It’s just re­ally sad to know that I won’t be able to play my fi­nal NSG prop­erly and end it on a high and the fact that I didn’t even get to play with the school sucks, but at least I still got to train with my team­mates at ACJC and ex­pe­ri­ence what train­ing with coach (Kok Mun Wai) was like.”</p>
    <p>Other stu­dent-ath­letes shared her dis­ap­point­ment at the pos­si­bil­ity of not com­pet­ing in this year’s in­ter-school games.</p>
    <p>Soft­ball player Nur Aliya Nata­sya, 15, said the omis­sion was ex­pected but not be­ing able to rep­re­sent her Pe­icai Se­condary School team felt “very sad and wasted be­cause hard work has not paid off”.</p>
    <p>“It’s re­ally a huge deal for me be­cause not be­ing able to play and win for my se­condary school for the last time be­fore I leave is not what I had in mind,” she added.</p>
    <p>HOW TO STAY MO­TI­VATED</p>
    <p>De­spite the an­nounce­ment that their sports may not be in­cluded in this year’s NSG, the stu­dent-ath­letes are still train­ing and hop­ing that like other team sports, their sport can be mod­i­fied to be in­cluded in the com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>Net­ball coach Kok, 52, who trains the ACJC and CHIJ Se­condary (Toa Payoh) teams, said: “It will be a good com­pro­mise if they can mod­ify the game be­cause we can­not ex­pect every­thing to go back to nor­mal... At least they get to play in a com­pe­ti­tion and they’re just dy­ing to play.”</p>
    <p>Hockey coach Robin Ng, who coaches CHIJ St Ni­cholas Girls’</p>
    <p>School and Eunoia Ju­nior Col­lege, sug­gested hockey could also be played in a 3v3 for­mat, adding: “Maybe they can also al­low each school to send three teams for the 3v3 for­mat so that more play­ers can get a chance to play as well and you don’t kill the in­ter­est of the play­ers.”</p>
    <p>With the lack of com­pe­ti­tions, keep­ing stu­dent-ath­letes mo­ti­vated could prove to be chal­leng­ing. Foot­ball coach Razif Ariff, 34, said: “We un­der­stand (that this is nec­es­sary with) the sit­u­a­tion that is hap­pen­ing now. But it could be frus­trat­ing, or the kids may lack mo­ti­va­tion be­cause they don’t know the pur­pose of train­ing.”</p>
    <p>The un­cer­tainty has forced some school coaches to get cre­ative with their train­ing ses­sions to keep their charges driven.</p>
    <p>Razif, who coaches Kent Ridge Se­condary School and Jurongvill­e Se­condary School, holds in­ter­nal com­pe­ti­tions dur­ing train­ing to pit his charges against one an­other in 1v1 or 2v2 chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>If the NSG is can­celled, Ng hopes there could be a mini hockey tour­na­ment among schools that is held within the safety guide­lines or an in­ter­nal com­pe­ti­tion for the school’s cur­rent play­ers and its alumni to give the stu­dent-ath­letes a chance to com­pete.</p>
    <p>The 45-year-old said: “It’s dif­fer­ent but it gets them to­gether and at least they get to com­pete one last time be­fore they go to their re­spec­tive uni­ver­si­ties. They’re re­ally very dis­ap­pointed be­cause they’ve been train­ing very hard.”</p>
    <p>Not hav­ing com­pe­ti­tion ex­pe­ri­ence this year could also af­fect those who are bank­ing on their sports per­for­mance for the DSA ex­er­cise or schol­ar­ship ap­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus out­break saw last year’s DSA ex­er­cise mov­ing on­line, with MOE an­nounc­ing last May that schools would not hold phys­i­cal tri­als or face-to-face in­ter­views as part of their se­lec­tion process to en­sure that there was no in­ter­min­gling of stu­dents across schools.</p>
    <p>TRAIN­ING MUST GO ON</p>
    <p>They keep ask­ing me (about NSG)... But for now, at least they still can con­tinue train­ing, even if it’s in small groups.</p>
    <p>THINK­ING POS­I­TIVELY</p>
    <p>While the coaches un­der­stand their charges’ de­spair at pos­si­bly missing their sec­ond con­sec­u­tive NSG, they were thank­ful that they could still train.</p>
    <p>Queensway Se­condary School girls’ foot­ball coach Merah Ah­mad, 63, said: “They keep ask­ing me (whether foot­ball is in­cluded in the NSG), but we just have to wait for MOE’s de­ci­sion and fol­low it.</p>
    <p>“But for now, at least they still can con­tinue train­ing, even if it’s in small groups.”</p>
    <p>While she felt de­mor­alised when she heard the news, St An­drew’s Ju­nior Col­lege (SAJC) net­baller Amelia Chu, 17, is try­ing to look at the sit­u­a­tion pos­i­tively.</p>
    <p>The JC2 stu­dent said: “We will not give up and be ready for what­ever comes our way.</p>
    <p>“I play net­ball be­cause I like it. Though it’s re­ally sad be­cause play­ing for the school is a gift that comes with my pas­sion for net­ball, it doesn’t make me not like net­ball any more. I’ll just find other ways to play or par­tic­i­pate in fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>MERAH AH­MAD, Queensway Se­condary‘s girls’ foot­ball coach.</p>
    <p>NO FAREWELL</p>
    <p>It’s just re­ally sad to know that I won’t be able to play my fi­nal NSG prop­erly and end it on a high.</p>
