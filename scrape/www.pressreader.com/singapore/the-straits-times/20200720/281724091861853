    <p>MEL­BOURNE • Aus­tralia’s sec­ond-big­gest city, Mel­bourne, will make it com­pul­sory to wear a mask in pub­lic, the au­thor­i­ties an­nounced yes­ter­day, as they step up ef­forts to bring a coro­n­avirus out­break un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria state, of which Mel­bourne is the cap­i­tal, now has nearly 3,000 ac­tive cases of Covid-19 after a fur­ther 363 in­fec­tions were re­ported yes­ter­day, de­spite a 10-day lock­down.</p>
    <p>Premier Daniel An­drews said more than five mil­lion peo­ple in Mel­bourne and the neigh­bour­ing Mitchell Shire would be re­quired to wear a mask or other face-cov­er­ing in pub­lic spa­ces from midnight on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“There’s no vac­cine to this wildly in­fec­tious virus,” he said. Masks are “a sim­ple thing, but it’s about chang­ing habits, it’s about be­com­ing a sim­ple part of your rou­tine”.</p>
    <p>Fail­ure to com­ply with the new rule will mean a fine of A$200 (S$195) – though Mr An­drews said “com­mon sense” dis­cre­tion would be ap­plied to ac­tiv­i­ties such as run­ning or vis­it­ing a bank.</p>
    <p>Ban­danas and scarves will be ac­cept­able as face-cov­er­ings un­til the state can boost sup­plies of masks, Mr An­drews said, adding that any­thing was “bet­ter than no face-cov­er­ing at all”.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion makes Mel­bourne the first place in Aus­tralia to man­date the use of face-cov­er­ings.</p>
    <p>Mask-wear­ing is not com­mon in Aus­tralia and has not been part of the coun­try’s Covid-19 re­sponse un­til now.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Aus­tralia’s other states and ter­ri­to­ries have closed their bor­ders to peo­ple from Vic­to­ria in a bid to stop the out­break from spread­ing, as most re­gions have not re­ported any new lo­cally trans­mit­ted in­fec­tions for weeks.</p>
    <p>But the con­ta­gion has reached Syd­ney, where lo­cally trans­mit­ted cases have spiked in re­cent days after an ini­tial clus­ter emerged from an in­fected Mel­bour­nian who vis­ited a pop­u­lar pub.</p>
    <p>About 60 peo­ple in Syd­ney are fac­ing a fine of US$1,000 (S$1,390) each after at­tend­ing a party last Satur­day night and break­ing the pub­lic health guide­lines of no more than 20 vis­i­tors to a home, po­lice said.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has re­ported al­most 12,000 cases of Covid-19 na­tion­wide and 122 deaths in a pop­u­la­tion of about 25 mil­lion.</p>
