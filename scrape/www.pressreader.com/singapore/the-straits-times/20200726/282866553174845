    <p>Com­pa­nies of­ten give per­for­mance bonuses to spur their staff to do bet­ter. But are such re­wards ef­fec­tive in driv­ing them to work harder?</p>
    <p>A Swedish bank may be about to change per­cep­tions of how bonuses af­fect per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Den­nis Camp­bell of the Har­vard Busi­ness School has been study­ing how com­pa­nies de­sign com­pen­sa­tion strate­gies.</p>
    <p>His work led him to the big­gest bank in Swe­den, Sven­ska Han­dels­banken, which he says uses a model that raises se­ri­ous ques­tions about how well bonuses drive re­sults.</p>
    <p>Han­dels­banken caught Prof Camp­bell’s at­ten­tion about five years ago. Since then, he’s writ­ten two case stud­ies on the Stock­holm­based lender, and his con­clu­sions chal­lenge the con­ven­tional wis­dom.</p>
    <p>He says staff at Han­dels­banken were highly mo­ti­vated de­spite the ab­sence of bonuses for all but a tiny group.</p>
    <p>What struck him was how flat Han­dels­banken’s cor­po­rate hi­er­ar­chy is, and how im­por­tant branch man­agers are.</p>
    <p>“Han­dels­banken just stood out as a re­ally in­ter­est­ing ex­am­ple be­cause they have re­ally un­usual lev­els of em­pow­er­ment,” he said in an in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>What’s more, he says the Swedish bank has “had these re­ally un­usual per­for­mance out­comes that nor­mally don’t go along with that level of de­cen­tral­i­sa­tion”.</p>
    <p>Banker bonuses have be­come an in­creas­ingly thorny sub­ject since the global fi­nan­cial melt­down of 2008.</p>
    <p>More re­cently, gov­ern­ments and reg­u­la­tors have put pres­sure on the in­dus­try to show re­straint on pay and in­stead use sur­plus cash for loans to busi­nesses hit by the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Many banks have com­plained that such re­stric­tions make it hard to at­tract the right talent. But the link be­tween bonuses and per­for­mance is hard to prove.</p>
    <p>Prof Camp­bell says Han­dels­banken stood out in part be­cause of its abil­ity to keep im­pair­ments low. He at­tributes that in no small mea­sure to a broad net­work of branches at which lo­cal em­ploy­ees know their clients bet­ter than most in the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Co­in­ci­den­tally, Han­dels­banken has placed less em­pha­sis on au­tomat­ing a lot of client-fac­ing ser­vices than some of its peers.</p>
    <p>“We would nor­mally think that the level of de­cen­tral­i­sa­tion that they have would lead to things like higher loan losses, would lead to less ef­fi­cien­cies in their cost struc­ture,” Prof Camp­bell says.</p>
    <p>“Yet here’s this bank that has op­er­ated this way since the 1970s and has had higher re­turns on eq­uity than its peers, not just on av­er­age over those years but lit­er­ally ev­ery sin­gle year, go­ing back that far, and has also had a frac­tion of the loan losses of their com­peti­tors in any given year, in­clud­ing in years when there were ma­jor eco­nomic crises.”</p>
    <p>About 1 per cent of Han­dels­banken’s em­ploy­ees, mostly in in­vest­ment bank­ing, re­ceive some form of vari­able pay, ac­cord­ing to Mr Jor­gen Olan­der, head of com­pen­sa­tion and ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>But it’s of­fered “with great cau­tion” and not to em­ploy­ees who can have a “ma­te­rial im­pact” on the bank’s risk pro­file, he says. In the first quar­ter, Han­dels­banken booked smaller im­pair­ments than any other ma­jor Nordic bank.</p>
    <p>Prof Camp­bell says his study showed that, de­spite not hav­ing “any skin in the game” in terms of per­sonal en­rich­ment, branch man­agers at Han­dels­banken ap­peared to “re­ally care deeply” about the cost-to-in­come ra­tio.</p>
    <p>Han­dels­banken does of­fer a profit-shar­ing plan – the Ok­to­go­nen Foun­da­tion, which also holds a 10 per cent stake in the com­pany –but em­ploy­ees have to wait till they turn 60 to see any of that money. That re­duces the risk that they’ll chase short-term gains with­out con­sid­er­ing long-term out­comes, he adds.</p>
    <p>The main take­away is that Han­dels­banken has man­aged to cre­ate “a very strong cul­ture or­gan­i­sa­tion” which, if done prop­erly, is a more po­tent way to gen­er­ate long-term prof­its than a bonus pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple are nat­u­rally mo­ti­vated,” he says. “That’s very dif­fer­ent than the as­sump­tion that many lead­ers make.”</p>
