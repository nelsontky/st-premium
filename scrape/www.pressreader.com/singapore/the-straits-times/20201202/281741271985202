    <p>Tech gi­ant Face­book will pay Bri­tish news out­lets mil­lions of pounds a year for con­tent as it read­ies to launch a ded­i­cated news tab on its UK plat­form next month.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment by Face­book on Mon­day comes as the so­cial net­work com­pany faces the threat of a gov­ern­ment crack­down over its dom­i­nance in on­line ad­ver­tis­ing, re­ported The Guardian.</p>
    <p>The Face­book News fea­ture, which was launched in the United States last year, will “pay pub­lish­ers for con­tent that is not al­ready on the plat­form and help pub­lish­ers reach new au­di­ences and bring more ad­ver­tis­ing and sub­scrip­tion op­por­tu­ni­ties”, said Face­book’s di­rec­tor of news part­ner­ships, Mr Jes­per Doub.</p>
    <p>A num­ber of main­stream Bri­tish news­pa­per groups have al­ready joined the fea­ture, un­der which their ar­ti­cles will ap­pear in a ded­i­cated news sec­tion on the site.</p>
    <p>The pub­lish­ers in­clude those that pro­duce The Econ­o­mist, The Guardian, The In­de­pen­dent and The Lon­don Evening Stan­dard, among oth­ers. “We ex­pect many more part­ners to join prior to launch,” said Mr Doub.</p>
    <p>News is typ­i­cally con­sumed on Face­book through links shared on one’s news feed, but the new ded­i­cated news tab will in­volve em­ploy­ees of the so­cial net­work site select­ing what they con­sider to be the main ar­ti­cles of the day from main­stream out­lets, said The Guardian.</p>
    <p>In re­turn, pub­lish­ers are be­ing promised sub­stan­tial cash sums and the prom­ise of new read­ers.</p>
    <p>The new fea­ture comes af­ter years of ten­sion be­tween tech gi­ants like Face­book and Google over calls by news pub­lish­ers in var­i­ous coun­tries for pay­ment of con­tent used on the on­line plat­forms.</p>
    <p>The Guardian re­ported that Face­book de­clined to com­ment on the amount of money it is putting into the new scheme, but some pub­lish­ers are pri­vately ex­pect­ing to make mil­lions of pounds a year from the multi-year deals they have signed with the so­cial net­work site.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, news in­dus­try sources es­ti­mated that the to­tal an­nual bill for Face­book is likely to run into the tens of mil­lions in the UK alone, mak­ing a dif­fer­ence to the fi­nances of strug­gling news out­lets.</p>
    <p>Ms Sarah Brown, Face­book’s head of news part­ner­ships in north­ern Europe, said: “It’s an ex­tremely large in­vest­ment and it’s some­thing we’ve done over mul­ti­ple years.” She said the cu­ra­tors would pri­ori­tise checks and bal­ances as­so­ci­ated with orig­i­nal re­port­ing when choos­ing which ar­ti­cles to high­light.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the launch of Face­book News in the US, fig­ures have shown that 95 per cent of the traf­fic to the news pub­lish­ers through the tab are new read­ers who “have not in­ter­acted with those news out­lets in the past”, said the com­pany.</p>
    <p>Mr Doub said Face­book is in “ac­tive ne­go­ti­a­tions” to bring the news fea­ture to France and Ger­many, and will “con­tinue to work with pub­lish­ers in coun­tries where mar­ket con­di­tions and reg­u­la­tory en­vi­ron­ments in­vite this kind of in­vest­ment and in­no­va­tion”.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this week, the UK au­thor­i­ties an­nounced a new tech reg­u­la­tor called the Dig­i­tal Mar­kets Unit, which will gov­ern the com­mer­cial re­la­tion­ships be­tween news pub­lish­ers and tech gi­ants to en­sure fair terms, es­pe­cially in the area of on­line ad­ver­tis­ing.</p>
    <p>In June, Face­book re­jected a pro­posal by the Aus­tralian au­thor­i­ties to share ad­ver­tis­ing rev­enue with news pub­lish­ers, adding that it could cut out news com­pletely with­out any sig­nif­i­cant im­pact on its busi­ness.</p>
    <p>...Face­book de­clined to com­ment on the amount of money it is putting into the new scheme, but some pub­lish­ers are pri­vately ex­pect­ing to make mil­lions of pounds a year from the multi-year deals they have signed with the so­cial net­work.</p>
