    <p>The star­tling news that United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and his wife had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 rat­tled in­vestors across the globe yes­ter­day, but lo­cal traders soon got back on an even keel.</p>
    <p>The ini­tial re­ac­tion on the lo­cal mar­ket saw the Straits Times In­dex (STI) fall as much as 1.2 per cent, but that ap­peared to be a knee-jerk re­ac­tion as the in­dex clawed back losses to fin­ish just 4.63 points, or 0.19 per cent, lower at 2,496.11, and up 0.96 per cent for the week.</p>
    <p>There were 946.63 mil­lion shares worth $860.45 mil­lion traded, with losers out­pac­ing gainers 192 to 137.</p>
    <p>Air­line gate­way ser­vices provider Sats was the in­dex’s best per­former, ris­ing 2.07 per cent to $2.96 af­ter DBS Bank raised it to a “buy” call with a tar­get price of $3.66.</p>
    <p>The bro­ker­age pointed to a re­cov­ery to pre-Covid-19 lev­els for in­ter­na­tional air travel in 2022. It ex­pects the stock to re-rate and nor­malise ahead of an an­tic­i­pated vac­cine ap­proval next year.</p>
    <p>The STI’s worst per­former was Thai Bev­er­age, which lost 2.46 per cent to 59.5 cents on news that the bev­er­age com­pany was wait­ing to hear from its unit, Saigon Beer Al­co­hol Bev­er­age Corp, if the Viet­namese gov­ern­ment was plan­ning to di­vest its re­main­ing stake in the beer maker.</p>
    <p>Sem­b­corp Marine was the most ac­tive counter for the fourth con­sec­u­tive day, trad­ing strong with a vol­ume of 123.8 mil­lion shares, although it closed down 3.9 per cent to 14.8 cents af­ter a four-day price rally. In­vestors ap­peared to be hope­ful of a merger with ri­val Kep­pel’s off­shore and marine unit.</p>
    <p>Mar­kets around the re­gion were mixed. Ja­pan’s Nikkei 225 shed 0.67 per cent af­ter re­cov­er­ing from an out­age on Thurs­day. Malaysian shares added 0.24 per cent.</p>
    <p>Weak com­mod­ity prices and risk aver­sion in the wake of Mr Trump’s di­ag­no­sis sent Aus­tralia’s S&P/ASX 200 in­dex slid­ing 1.4 per cent, leav­ing it down 2.9 per cent for the week – its worst weekly fall since lateApril.</p>
    <p>Oanda se­nior mar­ket an­a­lyst Jeffrey Hal­ley said: “The Trump Covid-19 di­ag­no­sis is a strong neg­a­tive for fi­nan­cial mar­kets and will lead to a ro­ta­tion into de­fen­sive po­si­tion­ing.”</p>
    <p>Even be­fore Mr Trump tested pos­i­tive, mar­kets had been pric­ing in the like­li­hood of tur­bu­lence on elec­tion day and the en­su­ing weeks.</p>
    <p>Now, with his health in doubt, in­vestors are warn­ing that the pro­longed un­cer­tainty and po­lit­i­cal chaos could be­come an even big­ger risk for mar­kets.</p>
