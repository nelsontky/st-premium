    <p>This one has it all: a brand-name film-maker in Christophe­r Nolan, big names in the cast and, most im­por­tantly, big ac­tion.</p>
    <p>In the science-fic­tion thriller, East Euro­pean arms trader An­drei Sa­tor con­sid­ers buy­ing foot­ball teams, elec­tions or pri­vate is­lands to be old hat. As played by a scar­ily stone-faced Ken­neth Branagh, su­per-vil­lain Sa­tor yearns for a re­source only he can af­ford: time.</p>
    <p>Like so much “hard” science fic­tion, Nolan’s sto­ries use a Big Idea to il­lus­trate a hu­man truth. In In­ter­stel­lar (2014) and In­cep­tion (2010), it is the yearn­ing of fathers to be with their chil­dren.</p>
    <p>In Tenet, the parental urge to re­unite is found in Sa­tor’s wife Kat, played by El­iz­a­beth De­bicki. Her path crosses with that of two mys­te­ri­ous men, Neil (Robert Pat­tin­son, above, right) and a name­less op­er­a­tive played by John David Washington (above, cen­tre).</p>
    <p>Things are berserk in their world – crashed cars right them­selves and bul­lets are sucked into a gun rather than ex­plode out of it. As one char­ac­ter says, some­one is caus­ing time in­ver­sion to hap­pen – it is not chang­ing speed, but di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>With its palin­dromic struc­ture – like its ti­tle, it can be read in ei­ther di­rec­tion – this is Nolan’s most am­bi­tious head-scratcher yet.</p>
    <p>At a dis­tance, the idea of time in­ver­sion will oc­ca­sion­ally cre­ate a sat­is­fy­ing men­tal click, while at a mi­cro level, the vis­ual au­dac­ity of the ac­tion set­pieces – a raid at the air­port, a mil­i­tary at­tack on an un­der­ground struc­ture, both done largely with­out com­puter-gen­er­ated ef­fects – makes one’s brain buzz with joy.</p>
