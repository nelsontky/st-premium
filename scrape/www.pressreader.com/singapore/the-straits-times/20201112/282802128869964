    <p>• Armed with a re­tort in­volv­ing proc­tol­o­gists, Os­car-nom­i­nated ac­tor Viggo Mortensen (left) is pre­pared for crit­i­cism of his de­ci­sion – as a straight man – to play a gay char­ac­ter in his di­rec­to­rial de­but, which pre­mieres in Bri­tain on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“I apol­o­gise to all the proc­tol­o­gists for cast­ing David Cro­nen­berg,” Mortensen, 62, said of his new film Fall­ing, in which the renowned Cana­dian di­rec­tor plays a col­orec­tal sur­geon.</p>
    <p>Mortensen, best known for his por­trayal of Aragorn in The Lord Of The Rings tril­ogy (2001 to 2003), said he was jok­ing, but wanted to make the point that ac­tors are ac­tors – sim­ply play­ing a role whether a gay man or a proc­tol­o­gist.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral high-pro­file ac­tors have been crit­i­cised re­cently for play­ing les­bian, gay, bi­sex­ual, trans­gen­der and queer char­ac­ters. Os­car winner Halle Berry pulled out of a trans­gen­der film role fol­low­ing crit­i­cism from ac­tivists.</p>
    <p>“There are cer­tain char­ac­ters I’m not go­ing to play,” said Mortensen, who has been nom­i­nated for three Os­cars, four Golden Globes and three Baf­tas.</p>
    <p>“I wouldn’t play Eric, the Chi­nese-Hawai­ian Amer­i­can,” Mortensen, who is Dan­ish-Amer­i­can, said of the hus­band of his film’s main char­ac­ter, John.</p>
    <p>Fall­ing tells the story of John’s racist and ho­mo­pho­bic fa­ther Wil­lis, played by Lance Hen­rik­sen, who moves from his rural farm to live with his son in Los An­ge­les when he starts show­ing early signs of de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>Mortensen, who wrote and di­rected the film as well as played its main pro­tag­o­nist, was keen to stress that his de­ci­sion to make John a gay man was not “a gim­mick, an­chor or some trig­ger”.</p>
    <p>It was while writ­ing an early scene in which John gets a tele­phone call from his part­ner as Wil­lis wan­ders off in an air­port, that Mortensen de­cided to switch John’s sex­u­al­ity.</p>
    <p>“I thought, what if it’s not a wife? What if it’s a hus­band?” Mortensen said.</p>
    <p>“I’ll try that. I’ll write the next scene and see how it feels. If it doesn’t work or feels some­how not right for the story, then I won’t use it, but I liked it.”</p>
    <p>Fall­ing can be seen as a mi­cro­cosm of a po­larised so­ci­ety, riven by is­sues of race and gen­der as much by sex­u­al­ity, Mortensen said. “There’s been so much in­jus­tice to­wards un­der-rep­re­sented groups, racially, sex­ual ori­en­ta­tion (and in terms of) sex­ual iden­ti­fi­ca­tion.”</p>
    <p>The film, which also stars Os­car-nom­i­nated ac­tress Laura Lin­ney, was ac­cepted for the of­fi­cial se­lec­tion at the Cannes Film Fes­ti­val be­fore the coro­n­avirus pan­demic forced the can­cel­la­tion of the pres­ti­gious event.</p>
    <p>Fall­ing opens in Bri­tain as part of the vir­tual Am­plify! Fes­ti­val, a joint event by the re­gional film fes­ti­vals of Bath, Brighton, Cam­bridge and Corn­wall, be­fore go­ing on gen­eral re­lease from Dec 4.</p>
