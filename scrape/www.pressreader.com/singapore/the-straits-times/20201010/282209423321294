    <p>BUENOS AIRES • Lionel Messi said he hoped Ar­gentina’s 1-0 de­feat of Ecuador i n their open­ing 2022 World Cup qual­i­fier on Thurs­day would pro­vide some re­lief to Ar­gen­tini­ans suf­fer­ing from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old scored the only goal of the match by con­vert­ing a first-half penalty as the Al­bice­leste started their cam­paign with a gritty, if not en­tirely con­vinc­ing, home vic­tory at La Bom­bon­era.</p>
    <p>“It has been a com­pli­cated year for ev­ery­one,” the Barcelona for­ward told re­porters. “With the na­tional team we want to try to make peo­ple happy with this vic­tory in a dif­fi­cult sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“It was good to de­com­press the sit­u­a­tion a lit­tle bit and send strength to all Ar­gen­tines.”</p>
    <p>Ar­gentina has been one of the worst-af­fected coun­tries by the virus with more than 856,000 cases and over 22,700 fa­tal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>While there had been con­cerns re­gard­ing play­ers trav­el­ling be­tween South Amer­ica and Europe to play in the qual­i­fiers, Fifa had said ear­lier that they must be ex­empted from any quar­an­tine re­stric­tions, both in the coun­tries where they are due to play matches and in the coun­try where their clubs are based.</p>
    <p>If there was a quar­an­tine pe­riod of five days or more on ar­rival in any of those coun­tries, then clubs would not be obliged to re­lease them.</p>
    <p>In the sur­real at­mos­phere of an empty Bom­bon­era – the iconic Boca Ju­niors sta­dium in Buenos Aires that is usu­ally bounc­ing from the pas­sion of fer­vent fans – Ar</p>
    <p>Ar­gentina cap­tain Lionel Messi elud­ing Ecuador’s An­gel Mena in their World Cup qual­i­fier in Buenos Aires on Thurs­day. The 2022 Fi­nals will ar­guably be the 33-year-old su­per­star’s last chance to win the ti­tle.</p>
    <p>gen­tina dom­i­nated pos­ses­sion but strug­gled to break down an or­gan­ised and phys­i­cal Ecuador out­fit.</p>
    <p>Messi un­suc­cess­fully tried to force his way out of Barcelona in the close sea­son but he seemed much hap­pier in the light blue and white jersey of his coun­try.</p>
    <p>And he was once again the match win­ner when Ar­gentina needed him to be, to avoid slip­ping up at home to Ecuador for the sec­ond time run­ning in an open­ing World Cup qual­i­fier, hav­ing lost 2-0 to the same op­po­nents four years ago.</p>
    <p>But he also ad­mit­ted that the match did not pan out as the team had hoped, ru­ing their lethargy early on.</p>
    <p>“I was ex­pect­ing an­other level of</p>
    <p>play, some­thing else, but it’s nor­mal. We haven’t played for a year,” the six-time Bal­lon d’Or win­ner said. “It’s the anx­i­ety of the first game. The im­por­tant thing is to keep grow­ing as we have done since the (2019) Copa Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>“They (Ecuador) came at us with­out fear and it was dif­fi­cult for us to play, but we were calm. In the first half we man­aged to get the ball back and if we had played more quickly, it would have been dif­fer­ent, but it turned out like this, and we have to con­tinue. It was im­por­tant to get off to a win­ning start be­cause all matches are go­ing to be tough.”</p>
    <p>Ar­gentina’s next qual­i­fier will be away to Bo­livia on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>In Mon­te­v­ideo, Luis Suarez scored a record-ex­tend­ing 60th in­ter­na­tional goal for Uruguay be­fore sub­sti­tute Maxi Gomez bagged a stop­page-time win­ner against Chile.</p>
    <p>Atletico Madrid for­ward Suarez opened the scor­ing from the penalty spot on 39 minutes af­ter Se­bas­tian Ve­gas was harshly pe­nalised for hand­ball.</p>
    <p>In­ter Mi­lan’s Alexis Sanchez equalised with a low shot on 54 minutes but Gomez had the last word with a stun­ning half-vol­ley from 20 yards to com­plete the 2-1 win.</p>
    <p>Paraguay’s An­gel Romero and Peru’s An­dre Car­rillo both scored a brace as their match ended in a 2-2 draw.</p>
