    <p>(Gansu) • Glaciers in China’s bleak Qil­ian moun­tains are dis­ap­pear­ing at a shock­ing rate as global warm­ing brings un­pre­dictable change and raises the prospect of crip­pling, long-term wa­ter short­ages, ac­cord­ing to sci­en­tists.</p>
    <p>The largest glacier in the 800km moun­tain chain on the arid north­east­ern edge of the Ti­betan plateau has re­treated about 450m since the 1950s, when re­searchers set up China’s first mon­i­tor­ing sta­tion to study it.</p>
    <p>The 20 sq km glacier, known as Lao­hugou No. 12, is criss-crossed by rivulets of wa­ter down its craggy, grit-blown sur­face.</p>
    <p>It has shrunk by about 7 per cent since mea­sure­ments be­gan, with melt­ing ac­cel­er­at­ing i n re­cent years, sci­en­tists say. Equally alarm­ing is the loss of thick­ness, with about 13m of ice dis­ap­pear­ing as tem­per­a­tures have risen, said Mr Qin Xiang, the direc­tor at the mon­i­tor­ing sta­tion.</p>
    <p>“The speed that this glacier has been shrink­ing is re­ally shock­ing,” he told Reuters on a re­cent visit to the spar­tan sta­tion in a frozen, tree­less world where he and a small team of re­searchers track the changes.</p>
    <p>The Ti­betan plateau is known as the world’s Third Pole for the amount of ice long locked in the high-al­ti­tude wilder­ness. But since the 1950s, av­er­age tem­per­a­tures in the area have risen about 1.5 deg C, Mr Qin said, and with no sign of an end to warm­ing, the out­look is grim for the 2,684 glaciers in the Qil­ian range.</p>
    <p>Across the moun­tains, glacier re­treat was 50 per cent faster in 1990-2010 than it was from 1956 to 1990, data from the China Academy of Sciences shows.</p>
    <p>“When I first came here in 2005, the glacier was around that point there where the river bends,” Mr Qin said, point­ing to where the rock-strewn slopes of the Lao­hugou val­ley chan­nel the wind­ing river to lower ground.</p>
    <p>The flow of wa­ter in a stream near the ter­mi­nus of the Lao­hugou No. 12 runoff is about dou­ble what it was 60 years ago, Mr Qin said.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther down­stream, near Dun­huang, once a ma­jor junc­tion on the an­cient Silk Road, wa­ter flow­ing out of the moun­tains has formed a lake in the desert for the first time in 300 years, state me­dia re­ported.</p>
    <p>Global warm­ing is also blamed for changes in the weather that have brought other un­pre­dictable con­di­tions. Snow­fall and rain had at times been much less than nor­mal, so even though the melt­ing glaciers have brought more runoff, farm­ers down­stream can still face wa­ter short­ages for their crops and their an­i­mals.</p>
    <p>Large sec­tions of the Shule River, on the out­skirts of Dun­huang, were ei­ther dry or re­duced to murky patches of pool, iso­lated in desert scrub when Reuters vis­ited in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>The new fluc­tu­a­tions also bring dan­ger. “Across the re­gion, glacial melt wa­ter is pool­ing into lakes and caus­ing dev­as­tat­ing floods,” said Green­peace East Asia cli­mate and en­ergy cam­paigner Liu Jun­yan. “In spring, we’re see­ing in­creased flood­ing, and then when wa­ter is needed most for ir­ri­ga­tion later in the sum­mer, we’re see­ing short­ages.”</p>
    <p>The melt­ing in the moun­tains could peak within a decade, af­ter which snow melt would sharply de­crease due to the smaller, fewer glaciers, said China Academy of Sciences ex­pert Shen Yong­ping.</p>
