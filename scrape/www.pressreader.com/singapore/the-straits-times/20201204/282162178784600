    <p>When she started re­ceiv­ing un­so­licited mes­sages of a sex­ual na­ture from a male col­league, she ig­nored them ini­tially.</p>
    <p>But Tina (not her real name) re­ported him to her man­ager when he con­tin­ued to harass her, only to be told she was over­re­act­ing. The man­ager re­fused to take any ac­tion, so</p>
    <p>Tina re­signed as she felt un­safe.</p>
    <p>Cases in­volv­ing un­wanted and ex­plicit sex­ual mes­sages and calls quadru­pled be­tween 2016 and last year, the As­so­ci­a­tion of Women for Ac­tion and Re­search (Aware) told The New Pa­per on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of cases in which the per­pe­tra­tor was from the vic­tim’s work­place also more than tripled in the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>This is con­sis­tent with a con­tin­ued spike in tech­nol­ogy-en­abled sex­ual vi­o­lence that the women’s rights group has ob­served over the last four years. Its Sex­ual As­sault Care Cen­tre han­dled 140 such cases last year, triple the 47 in 2016.</p>
    <p>The cases in­volved acts such as voyeurism and co­er­cive sex-based com­mu­ni­ca­tions en­abled by dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies like so­cial me­dia and mes­sag­ing plat­forms.</p>
    <p>Aware’s head of ad­vo­cacy and re­search Shai­ley Hin­go­rani said: “The terms sur­round­ing tech­nol­ogy-fa­cil­i­tated sex­ual vi­o­lence – from ‘up­skirt­ing’ to ‘SG Nasi Le­mak’ – have be­come de­press­ingly com­mon par­lance in Sin­ga­pore of late.”</p>
    <p>There were 41 cases in­volv­ing un­wanted and ex­plicit sex­ual mes­sages and calls last year. A third of the cases were per­pe­trated by some­one from the vic­tim’s work­place.</p>
    <p>Ms Hin­go­rani told TNP: “We must bear in mind that sex­ual abuse cases tend to be se­verely un­der­re­ported.</p>
    <p>“In the case of work­place sex­ual ha­rass­ment, many vic­tims do not re­port the abuse be­cause they fear they are not go­ing to be be­lieved or they are afraid of re­tal­i­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>In some cases, vic­tims do not know who to re­port to, or may not have faith that the man­age­ment or hu­man re­source depart­ment will take their com­plaints se­ri­ously.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Hin­go­rani: “We rec­om­mend the in­tro­duc­tion of work­place sex­ual ha­rass­ment leg­is­la­tion that places le­gal obli­ga­tions on em­ploy­ers to take ac­tive steps to pre­vent ha­rass­ment and to thor­oughly in­ves­ti­gate ev­ery re­ported case.”</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy can also fa­cil­i­tate off­line abuse, in­clud­ing rape and sex­ual as­sault. This hap­pened in 50 of the 140 cases last year. For in­stance, ride-hail­ing or dat­ing apps pro­vide a plat­form for per­pe­tra­tors to be con­nected to vic­tims, said Aware.</p>
    <p>In one case, a woman was raped by a man she met through a dat­ing app. In an­other, a woman who hailed a ride to work was ha­rassed by her driver who made ex­plicit re­marks, in­clud­ing how he liked to touch fe­males on the train.</p>
    <p>Both Grab and Go­jek said they have zero tol­er­ance for driv­ers and cus­tomers found to have such be­hav­iour, and have lever­aged tech­nol­ogy to safe­guard pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>Go­jek Sin­ga­pore gen­eral man­ager Lien Choong Luen said users guilty of ha­rass­ment will be banned from the plat­form and re­ported to the po­lice. He said the com­pany con­tin­ues to in­vest in pre­ven­tion and other safety mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Man­ual ver­i­fi­ca­tion of users is key for match­mak­ing com­pany Lunch Ac­tu­ally, which has a dat­ing app.</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive Vi­o­let Lim said: “We have en­coun­tered very few cases (of sex­ual vi­o­lence) in the last 16 years... Any ac­tion that causes harm or dis­tress will be in­ves­ti­gated thor­oughly.”</p>
    <p>Im­age-based sex­ual abuse, which in­cludes voyeurism and revenge porn, re­mained the most com­mon form of tech-en­abled sex­ual vi­o­lence, with 54 cases last year, said Aware.</p>
