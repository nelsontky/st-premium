    <p>MR PA­TRICK KY, EU AVI­A­TION SAFETY AGENCY EX­EC­U­TIVE DI­REC­TOR, ON THE IM­PACT OF THE PAN­DEMIC ON PI­LOTS.</p>
    <p>NEW YORK • On Sept 15, an In­done­sian flight car­ry­ing 307 pas­sen­gers and 11 crew to the north­ern city of Medan mo­men­tar­ily veered off the run­way af­ter land­ing, spark­ing an in­ves­ti­ga­tion by the coun­try’s trans­port safety reg­u­la­tor.</p>
    <p>It found the pi­lot had flown less than three hours in the pre­vi­ous 90 days. The first of­fi­cer had not flown since Feb 1.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent un­der­lines an emerg­ing risk from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic: Pi­lots are not get­ting enough op­por­tu­nity to fly be­cause air­lines have grounded planes and scaled back op­er­a­tions due to a slump in de­mand for air travel.</p>
    <p>In its pre­lim­i­nary re­port, In­done­sia’s Na­tional Trans­porta­tion Safety Com­mit­tee said the pan­demic has made it harder to main­tain pi­lot pro­fi­ciency and fly­ing ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>The Lion Air air­craft in­volved was an Air­bus SE A330, one of 10 in the car­rier’s fleet. Be­cause Lion Air does not have a sim­u­la­tor for the A330, its pi­lots are trained at third­party fa­cil­i­ties in In­done­sia, Malaysia and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 travel re­stric­tions have made those harder to ac­cess. “Reg­u­lar fly­ing keeps your mind in the cock­pit,” said Cap­tain Mo­han Ran­ganathan, an avi­a­tion safety con­sul­tant who was an ad­viser to In­dia’s Direc­torate-Gen­eral of Civil Avi­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing away from fly­ing for such a long time brings in some com­pla­cency. Add loss of in­come, un­cer­tainty about jobs or the fu­ture of the air­line, that brings in ad­di­tional stress. With an in­crease in stress lev­els, pro­fi­ciency drops.”</p>
    <p>An­a­lyt­ics com­pany Cir­ium says al­most a third of the world’s pas­sen­ger jets re­main in stor­age – parked in the cen­tre of Aus­tralia and the United States’ Mo­jave Desert.</p>
    <p>While there has been a re­cov­ery in do­mes­tic travel in larger mar­kets such as China, in­ter­na­tional traf­fic is way off pre-pan­demic lev­els be­cause of bor­der re­stric­tions and manda­tory quar­an­tine, a big deter­rent to trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of pi­lots have been laid off or fur­loughed, and those still in work are fly­ing a lot less be­cause there is so lit­tle de­mand.</p>
    <p>The re­turn to the skies of Boe­ing’s 737 Max could add an­other layer of com­plex­ity. The jet was grounded world­wide in March last year af­ter two fa­tal crashes, but was last month cleared by the US Fed­eral Avi­a­tion Ad­min­is­tra­tion with an ex­ten­sive pack­age of fixes.</p>
    <p>Pi­lot rusti­ness was also cited by Europe’s top avi­a­tion safety of­fi­cial as a pos­si­ble fac­tor in the crash of a Pak­istan In­ter­na­tional Air­lines (PIA) plane in Karachi in May that killed all but two of the 99 peo­ple on board. No­body was in­jured in the Lion Air run­way in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Said Euro­pean Union Avi­a­tion Safety Agency ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Pa­trick Ky in Septem­ber re­gard­ing the PIA flight: “The pi­lots did not seem to be as flu­ent in the way they were con­duct­ing their flights as they should have been.</p>
    <p>“If you haven’t flown for three months, six months, you need to be re­trained in some way in or­der to come back.”</p>
    <p>That con­cern is shared by oth­ers. At an event in Oc­to­ber, Sin­ga­pore’s cen­tral bank chief Ravi Menon spoke about the lin­ger­ing ef­fect Covid-19 will have on the avi­a­tion in­dus­try and pi­lots who have not flown for long pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>“It’s not like pick­ing up af­ter tak­ing two months off. When you take two years off, it’s very dif­fer­ent,” he said.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with Bloomberg Tele­vi­sion last week, the In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion’s vice-pres­i­dent for the Asia-Pa­cific, Mr Con­rad Clif­ford, said the in­dus­try group has been look­ing at creat­ing spe­cial travel bub­bles so pi­lots can ac­cess sim­u­la­tors to en­sure they can re­main cur­rent. “I’m glad to say that gov­ern­ments are do­ing some­thing about this,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tion­ally, the In­ter­na­tional Civil Avi­a­tion Or­gan­i­sa­tion has called for flight crew to be recog­nised as key work­ers so they can use travel bub­bles and ac­cess train­ing fa­cil­i­ties, in­clud­ing sim­u­la­tors, to main­tain cer­ti­fi­ca­tions, ex­pe­ri­ence and pro­fi­ciency.</p>
    <p>Cap­tain Ian Cheng, se­nior vicepres­i­dent of flight op­er­a­tions at Scoot, Sin­ga­pore Air­lines’ low-cost car­rier, said its pi­lots are be­ing kept en­gaged with sim­u­la­tor ses­sions and meet­ings to be up­dated on lat­est de­vel­op­ments.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause of the low amount of fly­ing, it’s es­sen­tial to keep pro­fi­ciency lev­els up,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Capt Ran­ganathan, it will take about a month of reg­u­lar fly­ing for pi­lots to get their con­fi­dence and skill lev­els back, along with lots of train­ing.</p>
    <p>“When you are not fo­cused, de­ci­sions can get de­layed,” he said. “Just a few sec­onds can make a dif­fer­ence be­tween a safe flight or an ac­ci­dent.”</p>
