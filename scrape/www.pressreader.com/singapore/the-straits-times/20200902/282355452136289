    <p>Mr Feroz Ak­bar plans to over­haul his video game sys­tem at the end of the year. In his crosshairs is the up­com­ing Sony PlayS­ta­tion 5 (PS5) game con­sole.</p>
    <p>The 39-year-old busi­ness owner is also eye­ing a new tele­vi­sion set to get the most out of the PS5. “I would even go as far as buy­ing only a Sony 4K tele­vi­sion be­cause I feel the PlayS­ta­tion folks might ac­tu­ally de­sign some­thing that would give Sony TVs an edge in terms of gam­ing per­for­mance,” he says.</p>
    <p>Sony’s PS5 and Mi­crosoft’s Xbox Se­ries X are the highly an­tic­i­pated next-gen­er­a­tion con­soles from the two video game ti­tans.</p>
    <p>Both are ex­pected to launch in Novem­ber and will pack the lat­est tech­nolo­gies – such as fast stor­age drives and more re­al­is­tic-look­ing graph­ics – that are de­signed to stay rel­e­vant over a con­sole’s typ­i­cal life­span of six to eight years.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Mr Tom Wi­j­man, lead an­a­lyst at gam­ing and e-sports an­a­lyt­ics provider New­zoo, many early buy­ers will be like Mr Ak­bar, look­ing to also up­grade their TVs to mod­els that can tap the new ca­pa­bil­i­ties and fea­tures of the up­com­ing con­soles.</p>
    <p>“Early adopters will care more about op­ti­mal per­for­mance than most, es­pe­cially since launch con­tent is not shap­ing up to be a ma­jor driver to up­grade,” he says.</p>
    <p>To help gam­ing en­thu­si­asts pick a new TV to com­ple­ment their PS5 con­sole, Sony launched a “Ready for PlayS­ta­tion 5” tagline in July to de­note “op­ti­mum TVs” for the PS5. The first two TVs to carry this new brand­ing are Sony’s X90H and Z8H.</p>
    <p>How­ever, be­sides read­ing the man­u­fac­turer’s mar­ket­ing la­bels, early adopters should pay at­ten­tion to TVs that sup­port the lat­est HDMI 2.1 stan­dard, ac­cord­ing to an­a­lysts.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause HDMI 2.1 has the nec­es­sary band­width and the fea­ture sup­port for the new gam­ing tech­nolo­gies that dif­fer­en­ti­ate the up­com­ing game con­soles from their pre­de­ces­sors, al­low­ing for a smoother, more re­spon­sive gam­ing ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>“The new con­soles will push the tech­ni­cal spec­i­fi­ca­tions of cur­rent TV sets as they sup­port high frame rates of up to 120 frames per se­cond, high dy­namic range and 8K res­o­lu­tion,” says Mr To­mas ArceGil, se­nior lec­turer at DigiPen In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In fact, both game con­soles will be among the first source de­vices to sup­port HDMI 2.1.</p>
    <p>The up­date to HDMI 2.1 in­creases the max­i­mum band­width ca­pa­bil­ity of the HDMI in­ter­face – the pre­vail­ing dis­play con­nec­tor for TVs – from 18Gbps (in HDMI 2.0) to 48Gbps. The in­creased band­width al­lows res­o­lu­tions of up to 10K to be car­ried through this in­ter­face and re­quires new HDMI 2.1-com­pli­ant ca­bles.</p>
    <p>HDMI 2.1 will also en­able game con­soles to send 4K res­o­lu­tion video at a re­fresh rate of 120Hz to a com­pat­i­ble TV set, up from 4K at 60Hz for cur­rent game con­soles.</p>
    <p>A 120Hz re­fresh rate means that the TV re­draws the con­tents of the screen 120 times a se­cond. As video games of­ten in­volve fast-mov­ing im­ages, a higher re­fresh rate will lead to smoother game­play.</p>
    <p>An­other key gam­ing fea­ture in HDMI 2.1 is vari­able re­fresh rate (VRR). TVs that sup­port it will be able to dy­nam­i­cally change its re­fresh rate to ad­just to the frame rate out­put by a source de­vice like a game con­sole.</p>
    <p>Un­like movies, video games do not run at a con­sis­tent frame rate – some scenes may in­volve more in­ten­sive graph­i­cal ef­fects that cause a dip in frame rates while less in­ten­sive scenes may see a spike in frame rates. With­out VRR, a TV is un­able to re­spond to such changes, re­sult­ing in stut­ter­ing or un­sightly lines ap­pear­ing on the screen.</p>
    <p>HDMI 2.1 also adds auto lowla­tency mode (ALLM), a con­ve­nient fea­ture that al­lows a de­vice con­nected to a com­pat­i­ble TV to au­to­mat­i­cally switch to the TV’s game mode if it is avail­able.</p>
    <p>Game mode ba­si­cally tells the TV to dis­able most of its im­age pro­cess­ing, which re­duces in­put lag – the de­lay be­tween an im­age cre­ated by the con­sole and see­ing it on the screen. A lower in­put lag means that games will feel more re­spon­sive as gamers ex­pe­ri­ence l ess de­lay be­tween press­ing a but­ton on the con­troller and see­ing the re­sult on screen.</p>
    <p>For the best gam­ing ex­pe­ri­ence on the up­com­ing PS5 and Xbox Se­ries X con­soles, your tele­vi­sion sets should have the lat­est gam­ing fea­tures such as vari­able re­fresh rate (VRR) and auto low-la­tency mode (ALLM).</p>
    <p>A su­per-low in­put lag – less than 20ms – will also make games feel very re­spon­sive.</p>
    <p>Here are five picks to con­sider.</p>
    <p>LG CX Oled (left), from $3,699</p>
    <p>LG has been an early adopter of the lat­est gam­ing fea­tures on its TVs. With sup­port for VRR, ALLM and the abil­ity to pro­duce 4K res­o­lu­tion at 120Hz, the new LG CX Oled TV is tai­lor-made for the up­com­ing con­soles.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, the smaller 48-inch model, which would be per­fect for a gam­ing den, is not avail­able in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Al­ter­na­tively, the CX’s pre­de­ces­sor,</p>
    <p>2019’s C9 Oled TV, is equally ca­pa­ble when it comes to gam­ing, with four HDMI 2.1 ports.</p>
    <p>That is, if you can still find it in stores.</p>
    <p>LG Nano91 (left), from $2,799</p>
    <p>For those with a smaller bud­get, the LG Nano91 of­fers sim­i­lar gam­ing fea­tures as the more ex­pen­sive LG CX. But the Nano91 uses an in-plane switch­ing (IPS) screen that is not as good as the CX’s Oled screen in terms of pic­ture qual­ity and view­ing an­gles.</p>
    <p>Sam­sung Q95T (left), from $3,771</p>
    <p>The up­com­ing con­soles can sup­port 8K res­o­lu­tion, but the jury is still out on the is­sue of games run­ning at 8K res­o­lu­tion as there has been lit­tle men­tion about it from de­vel­op­ers.</p>
    <p>Hence, go with Sam­sung’s best 4K tele­vi­sion of this year, the Q95T, in­stead of its flag­ship Q950T, which is an 8K model.</p>
    <p>The Q95T has all the nec­es­sary pre­req­ui­sites for next-gen­er­a­tion con­sole gam­ing, such as sup­port of VRR (via AMD FreeSync). Sam­sung also has a Real Game En­hancer+ fea­ture that au­to­mat­i­cally re­duces ghost­ing and mo­tion blur in fast-mov­ing games.</p>
