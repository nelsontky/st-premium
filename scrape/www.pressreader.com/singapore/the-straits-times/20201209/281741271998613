    <p>AGE OF CHUCK YEA­GER, THE FIRST MAN TO FLY FASTER THAN SOUND, WHEN HE DIED ON MON­DAY |</p>
    <p>WASHINGTON • World War II fighter ace Chuck Yea­ger, who was the first man to travel faster than sound and whose gutsy test pi­lot ex­ploits were im­mor­talised in the Hol­ly­wood block­buster The Right Stuff, died on Mon­day. He was 97.</p>
    <p>“It is w/ pro­found sor­row, I must tell you that my life love Gen­eral Chuck Yea­ger passed just be­fore 9pm ET,” Mrs Vic­to­ria Yea­ger tweeted on her hus­band’s ac­count.</p>
    <p>“An in­cred­i­ble life well lived, Amer­ica’s great­est Pi­lot, & a legacy of strength, ad­ven­ture, & pa­tri­o­tism will be re­mem­bered for­ever.”</p>
    <p>She did not spec­ify the cause of her hus­band’s death.</p>
    <p>Mr Yea­ger rock­eted into his­tory by break­ing the sound bar­rier in the ex­per­i­men­tal Bell X-1 re­search air­craft in 1947, help­ing to pave the way for the US space pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>“It opened up space, Star Wars, satel­lites,” Mr Yea­ger said in a 2007 in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>Charles El­wood Yea­ger was born on Feb 13, 1923, in Myra, West Vir­ginia, and grew up fix­ing pick-up trucks along­side his fa­ther.</p>
    <p>He joined the Army Air Corps in Septem­ber 1941, three months be­fore the United States en­tered World War II, and started out as an air­craft me­chanic be­fore un­der­go­ing flight train­ing.</p>
    <p>Based in Eng­land, Mr Yea­ger be­gan fly­ing com­bat mis­sions in a P-51 Mus­tang long-range fighter in Fe­bru­ary 1944.</p>
    <p>He was shot down be­hind en­emy lines in March 1944 but was able to re­join his unit in Eng­land with the help of the French re­sis­tance after a har­row­ing trek over the Pyre­nees.</p>
    <p>Mr Yea­ger re­sumed com­bat and was cred­ited with 12½ aerial vic­to­ries by the war’s end, in­clud­ing down­ing five Ger­man Bf 109s on a sin­gle day.</p>
    <p>He booked his place in his­tory as a test pi­lot when he broke the sound bar­rier in the rocket-pow­ered Bell X-1 on Oct 14, 1947, earn­ing him the ti­tle of The Fastest Man Alive. After the X-1 was dropped from the belly of a B-29 bomber at 13,700m, he flew at su­per­sonic Mach 1.06 (1,130 kmh).</p>
    <p>Mr Yea­ger’s col­league Chalmers “Slick” Goodlin, an­other test pi­lot for Bell Lab­o­ra­to­ries, once fa­mously de­scribed the X-1 as a “bul­let with wings”. It was mod­elled after a .50-cal­i­bre bul­let, with short wings and a pointed tip, al­low­ing it to pierce the air more ef­fi­ciently.</p>
    <p>The air­craft, nick­named Glam­orous Glen­nis in hon­our of Mr Yea­ger’s first wife, is now in the Na­tional Air and Space Mu­seum in Washington DC.</p>
    <p>Be­fore his his­toric flight, Mr Yea­ger said he re­ceived ad­vice from Colonel Al­bert Boyd, who headed the Air Force’s su­per­sonic flight pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>“Get above Mach 1 as soon as you can, don’t bust your butt, and don’t em­bar­rass the Air Force,” Mr Yea­ger said Col Boyd told him.</p>
    <p>“I had done what the old man had sent us out to do,” Mr Yea­ger said.</p>
    <p>Mr Yea­ger’s ac­com­plish­ment was de­picted in the 1983 film The Right Stuff, based on the book by Tom Wolfe.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can ac­tor Sam Shep­ard re­ceived an Os­car nom­i­na­tion for Best Sup­port­ing Ac­tor for his por­trayal of Mr Yea­ger in the movie.</p>
    <p>Mr Yea­ger would go on to set nu­mer­ous other flight records, but most of his ca­reer was spent as a mil­i­tary com­man­der di­rect­ing US fighter squadrons through­out the 1950s and 1960s.</p>
    <p>He re­tired from the US Air Force in 1975 as a brigadier-gen­eral, hav­ing logged more than 10,000 hours of flight time in around 360 dif­fer­ent mod­els of mil­i­tary air­craft.</p>
    <p>Mr Yea­ger was in­ducted into the Na­tional Avi­a­tion Hall of Fame in 1973, and he kept fly­ing into his later years, even break­ing the sound bar­rier at age 89.</p>
