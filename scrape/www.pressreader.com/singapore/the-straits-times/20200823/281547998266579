    <p>Din­ers are still at­tempt­ing to book mul­ti­ple ta­bles at some food and bev­er­age (F&B) out­lets to cir­cum­vent so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules, although the ma­jor­ity ad­here to safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Checks by The Sunday Times yes­ter­day with three restau­rant own­ers showed some pa­trons con­tinue their at­tempts to bend rules that limit each ta­ble to five.</p>
    <p>Mr Sid Kim, owner of Kore­anMex­i­can restau­rants Vatos Ur­ban Ta­cos at South Beach and Vatos Cantina at Hol­land Vil­lage, said his out­lets re­ceive at least one re­quest a day to ac­com­mo­date groups larger than five peo­ple across mul­ti­ple ta­bles.</p>
    <p>These re­quests, whether made on­line or dur­ing walk-ins, are im­me­di­ately turned down.</p>
    <p>“We are al­most bit­ing the hand that feeds us,” said Mr Kim.</p>
    <p>“We need cus­tomers to sur­vive but we are asked to po­lice them our­selves now, which is not really our job. But the sit­u­a­tion be­ing what it is, I guess we don’t have much choice.”</p>
    <p>On Fri­day, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said only house­holds with more than five mem­bers can book more than one ta­ble to have a meal to­gether.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong co-chairs the multi-min­istry task force bat­tling Covid-19 which also tight­ened other rules re­cently, with F&B out­lets lim­ited to recorded mu­sic played softly in the back­ground so pa­trons do not have to raise their voices to be heard.</p>
    <p>Live mu­sic and live broad­casts – on TV and ra­dio – as well as video screen­ings are still banned.</p>
    <p>Mr Kim said that while he will ac­cept book­ings from large house­holds, he is wor­ried din­ers may “work” the sys­tem and claim to be from the same home.</p>
    <p>“How do we really know every­one is part of the same fam­ily? How can we ver­ify? If a safe am­bas­sador comes and dis­cov­ers that sev­eral mem­bers are not fam­ily, does the restau­rant get into trou­ble?” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Collin Ho, chief ex­ec­u­tive of ca­sual restau­rant chain Collin’s, said its 10 out­lets have not en­coun­tered din­ers mak­ing mul­ti­ple-ta­ble reser­va­tions.</p>
    <p>“Oc­ca­sion­ally, our staff have had to po­litely re­mind our cus­tomers that they can only re­move their masks once the food and drinks have been served,” he added, not­ing that cus­tomers gen­er­ally do not linger after they have fin­ished their meals.</p>
    <p>Mr Ho wel­comed the new rule al­low­ing house­holds with more than five fam­ily mem­bers to dine to­gether. “Our staff will con­tinue to seat the cus­tomers at ta­bles based on the 1m rule and are trained to keep a look­out for cus­tomers who do not com­ply with this safety mea­sure,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Cedric Tang, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of lo­cal her­itage restau­rant brand Ka-Soh, said he has been quite lucky, as most of his din­ers typ­i­cally turn up in groups of three or four.</p>
    <p>While only one of his three out­lets has a sound sys­tem play­ing soft back­ground mu­sic, he is seek­ing clar­ity on what con­sti­tutes “soft mu­sic”.</p>
    <p>“If there are 10 safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors go­ing around en­forc­ing this, I be­lieve all 10 will have a dif­fer­ent stan­dard of what ‘soft mu­sic’ is. How soft is soft?”</p>
    <p>On Aug 15, hot­pot restau­rant Hai Xian Lao was fined $2,000 and or­dered to sus­pend op­er­a­tions for 10 days for fail­ing to com­ply with safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The restau­rant, lo­cated on the fourth level of Shaw House in Or­chard Road, had al­lowed cus­tomers to con­sume al­co­hol on its premises after 10.30pm and failed to en­sure that group sizes did not ex­ceed five peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Checks by the au­thor­i­ties showed a group of more than 20 had been seated in a locked pri­vate room within the restau­rant.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Lorong Mam&#xAD;bong, which has pop&#xAD;u&#xAD;lar eater&#xAD;ies, was busy last night. Food and bev&#xAD;er&#xAD;age out&#xAD;lets still find some cus&#xAD;tomers at&#xAD;tempt&#xAD;ing to bend so&#xAD;cial dis&#xAD;tanc&#xAD;ing rules lim&#xAD;it&#xAD;ing the size of groups din&#xAD;ing out.</p>
