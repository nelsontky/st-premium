    <p>•</p>
    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES After three tour­na­ment wins and a FedExCup ti­tle, Dustin John­son added more hard­ware to his tro­phy case on Mon­day when he was named PGA Tour Player of the Year for a sec­ond time.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can missed the start of the sea­son due to a knee in­jury and also had to sit out the three-month Covid-19 shut­down like ev­ery­one else.</p>
    <p>But he then had a blaz­ing end to the campaign with two wins and two run­ner-up fin­ishes in his last four starts that pushed him back to the top of the world rank­ings.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ries at the North­ern Trust and Tour Cham­pi­onships earned the 36-year-old a first FedExCup ti­tle and the US$15 mil­lion (S$20.4 mil­lion) pay­day that goes with the tro­phy.</p>
    <p>The Player of Year is voted by Tour mem­bers who played in at least 10 events dur­ing the 2019-20 sea­son.</p>
    <p>“Dustin made it known through­out the sea­son the FedExCup was a pri­or­ity and his per­for­mances in the FedExCup play-offs were noth­ing short of spec­tac­u­lar with two wins and a play-off run­ner-up at the BMW Cham­pi­onship,” said Tour com­mis­sioner Jay Mon­a­han.</p>
    <p>“His de­meanour and ath­leti­cism on the course make it look very easy, but be­hind the scenes, he’s worked in­cred­i­bly hard and his sea­son speaks for it­self.”</p>
    <p>The Tour did not re­lease the re­sults of bal­lot­ing, say­ing only that</p>
    <p>John­son, who also won in 2016, was se­lected over PGA Cham­pi­onship win­ner Collin Morikawa, Jon Rahm, Webb Simp­son and Justin Thomas.</p>
    <p>John­son, the 2016 US Open cham­pion, will now at­tempt to land his sec­ond ca­reer Ma­jor at the 120th US Open after fin­ish­ing run­ner-up be­hind com­pa­triot Morikawa at TPC Hard­ing Park in San Fran­cisco.</p>
    <p>The long-driv­ing star, who has come in sec­ond in three of the past five Ma­jors, will be a big favourite when the field tee off in to­mor­row’s open­ing round at Winged Foot, New York.</p>
    <p>“Win­ning a Ma­jor is just tough,” said John­son. “Get­ting that first one I feel is def­i­nitely the hard­est. After you win the first one, you know you can do it so it makes it eas­ier, but it’s never easy to win a Ma­jor.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­thing has got to go well. Ev­ery part of your game needs to be on point.”</p>
    <p>But he hopes to roll into the US Open and Novem­ber’s Masters with mo­men­tum from his FedExCup romp.</p>
    <p>“I’m ex­cited. I’m play­ing well,” he said. “I’ve got a lot of confidence in the game, so I’m re­ally look­ing for­ward to the next cou­ple of months.”</p>
    <p>While John­son has never played the 7,477-yard Winged Foot lay­out, which last hosted a Ma­jor 14 years ago, the 2006 US Open, world No. 2 Rahm is ex­pect­ing tough scor­ing con­di­tions, not too dis­sim­i­lar to Oak­mont in Pitts­burgh.</p>
    <p>“The greens kind of gave me an Oak­mont vibe: Ex­tremely dif­fi­cult, ex­tremely un­du­lated,” he said.</p>
    <p>“You can hold all the greens, even if you don’t hit a per­fect shot. It’s just a dif­fi­cult course. It’s long. It’s nar­row. It’s un­du­lated. You just need to play re­ally good golf.”</p>
    <p>WIN­NING COM­BI­NA­TION</p>
    <p>His de­meanour and ath­leti­cism on the course make it look very easy but be­hind the scenes, he’s worked in­cred­i­bly hard.</p>
