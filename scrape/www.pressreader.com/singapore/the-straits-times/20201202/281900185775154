    <p>LON­DON • The Bri­tish gov­ern­ment is urg­ing busi­nesses to make fi­nal prepa­ra­tions for a new trad­ing re­la­tion­ship with the Euro­pean Union from Jan 1, say­ing a new cen­tre to mon­i­tor goods will help ease what it de­scribed as “short-term dis­rup­tion” af­ter Brexit.</p>
    <p>With just a month to go be­fore the end of the Brexit tran­si­tion pe­riod, the gov­ern­ment re­minded ex­porters and im­porters that, with or with­out a trade deal, they must get ready for new pa­per­work and pro­ce­dures at the bor­der when Bri­tain leaves the EU’s sin­gle mar­ket and Cus­toms union.</p>
    <p>Many busi­nesses say they are strug­gling to pre­pare be­cause of a lack of clar­ity over the fu­ture re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain and the EU are still try­ing to seal a trade deal amid big dif­fer­ences on is­sues such as fishing and state aid.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, the gov­ern­ment said a new bor­der op­er­a­tions cen­tre would be set up to gather in­for­ma­tion on the flow of goods and peo­ple, adding: “Changes to the way we trade with Europe will likely mean that there is short­term dis­rup­tion at the bor­der.”</p>
    <p>Mr Michael Gove, the min­is­ter han­dling Bri­tain’s di­vorce deal, said: “This (cen­tre) will help us tackle chal­lenges quickly and de­ci­sively, and give us in­creased in­for­ma­tion which will make us safer and more se­cure.”</p>
    <p>And Busi­ness Min­is­ter Alok Sharma said he had writ­ten to nearly five mil­lion Bri­tish com­pa­nies to out­line “the top ac­tions they need to take”.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment’s crit­ics say it is putting the onus on busi­ness to take the hit from a new Cus­toms regime rather than equip­ping them with the tools to deal with what they fear will be chaos at the bor­der, even if the gov­ern­ment se­cures a deal. Fail­ure to se­cure a deal would mean higher prices and short­ages of fresh food in su­per­mar­kets, the crit­ics say.</p>
    <p>The Of­fice for Bud­get Re­spon­si­bil­ity has said such a fail­ure would wipe an ex­tra 2 per cent off the United King­dom’s eco­nomic out­put. Even with a deal, com­pa­nies will have to nav­i­gate Cus­toms checks and new rules at the bor­der af­ter Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son early on ruled out re­main­ing in the EU’s Cus­toms union.</p>
    <p>With each side urg­ing the other to com­pro­mise, a French of­fi­cial said Bri­tain must clar­ify its po­si­tions and “really ne­go­ti­ate”, and cau­tioned that the EU would not ac­cept a “sub­stan­dard deal”.</p>
    <p>Both sides have con­tin­gency plans for a no-deal exit.</p>
    <p>Even if a trade ac­cord is se­cured, it is likely to be just a nar­row deal on goods, and some dis­rup­tion is cer­tain as bor­der con­trols are erected be­tween Bri­tain and the world’s big­gest trad­ing bloc.</p>
    <p>A trade deal would not only safe­guard trade but also but­tress peace in Bri­tish-ruled North­ern Ire­land. Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel, Europe’s most pow­er­ful na­tional leader, has said some of the EU’s 27 mem­ber states are get­ting im­pa­tient.</p>
    <p>Ir­ish Prime Min­is­ter Micheal Martin said a deal could be done this week. “There is a land­ing zone for an agree­ment,” Mr Martin told the Ir­ish Times. “We are now really in the end-game if a deal is to be ar­rived at this week.”</p>
