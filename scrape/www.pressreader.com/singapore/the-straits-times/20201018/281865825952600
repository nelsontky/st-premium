    <p>Re­gional li­braries in Jurong, Tampines and Wood­lands can be vis­ited for up to three hours, a sig­nif­i­cant in­crease from the pre­vi­ous 30-minute limit. For all other pub­lic li­braries, the length of stay will be in­creased from 30 min­utes to two hours.</p>
    <p>Those vis­it­ing li­braries to read, study or work can look for­ward to more ser­vices re­sum­ing from Tues­day at the Na­tional Li­brary Build­ing, 25 pub­lic li­braries and Old­ham Theatre in the Na­tional Ar­chives of Sin­ga­pore Build­ing.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Li­brary Board (NLB) said in a state­ment on Thurs­day that it will open up seat­ing and study ar­eas in pub­lic li­braries, in­clud­ing the eNews­pa­per and mul­ti­me­dia sta­tions, with a timed en­try sys­tem and safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures still in place.</p>
    <p>It will also grad­u­ally re­sume pub­lic pro­grammes, apart from guided tours.</p>
    <p>More in­for­ma­tion about these pro­grammes can be found at NLB’s GoLi­brary site.</p>
    <p>The Study Lounge at level five of the Na­tional Li­brary Build­ing will also be re­opened, with a three-hour visit limit.</p>
    <p>Li­brary users will be able to visit the Lee Kong Chian Ref­er­ence Li­brary for up to three hours, up from the two-hour limit pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>Re­gional li­braries i n Jurong, Tampines and Wood­lands can be vis­ited for up to three hours, a sig­nif­i­cant in­crease from the pre­vi­ous 30-minute limit.</p>
    <p>For all other pub­lic li­braries, the length of stay will be in­creased from 30 min­utes to two hours.</p>
    <p>En­tries will be timed to man­age crowds. Li­brary users can make their on­line book­ings at https://go.gov.sg/li­brary-vis­it­book­ing for their pre­ferred slots.</p>
    <p>Book­ings are lim­ited to one per day, with slots re­leased daily for the fol­low­ing day.</p>
    <p>The Asian Film Archive’s pub­lic screen­ings of films at Old­ham Theatre will have an in­creased ca­pac­ity of 50 peo­ple per screen­ing for both the theatre and the atrium, with safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures con­tin­ued for seat­ing in the theatre and to limit in­ter­min­gling be­tween groups, NLB said.</p>
    <p>The grad­ual re­sump­tion of ser­vices comes af­ter pub­lic li­braries here re­sumed reg­u­lar open­ing hours on Sept 1.</p>
    <p>Safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, ca­pac­ity con­trols and fre­quent dis­in­fec­tion of high-touch points will con­tinue to be im­ple­mented at all NLB premises. Li­brary users must con­tinue to wear masks at all times.</p>
    <p>With pro­grammes re­sum­ing, ad­di­tional clean­ing, sani­tis­ing and ven­ti­la­tion of pro­gramme ar­eas will also be car­ried out be­tween ses­sions, NLB added.</p>
    <p>Due to ca­pac­ity re­stric­tions, li­brary users might have to queue and wait be­fore en­ter­ing the premises.</p>
    <p>Those head­ing to a li­brary can check the web­site https://go.gov.sg/li­brary-vis­itcrowd or the NLB mo­bile app for real-time crowd ca­pac­ity i n li­braries and ar­chives be­fore vis­it­ing.</p>
