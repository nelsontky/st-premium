    <p>With heavy snow­fall jam­ming the roads in Seoul, Sin­ga­porean Do­minic Phua spent nearly an hour walk­ing home af­ter work.</p>
    <p>The 30-year-old mar­ket­ing di­rec­tor saw a biker zoom by cov­ered in snow, cars skid­ding even at tor­toise pace, and a car stuck between two buses.</p>
    <p>“The snow sud­denly came and hit so fast and hard,” he told The Straits Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“The roads were too slip­pery and driv­ers in Seoul were just not pre­pared, with no win­ter tyres.”</p>
    <p>A cold snap has gripped South Korea, with a warn­ing is­sued for south­ern is­land Jeju for the first time in 57 years and overnight snow­fall na­tion­wide from Wed­nes­day caus­ing train de­lays, flight can­cel­la­tions and mi­nor traf­fic ac­ci­dents.</p>
    <p>Tem­per­a­tures in Seoul plunged to mi­nus 16.1 deg C yes­ter­day morn­ing, with a wind chill of mi­nus 25.3 deg C, ac­cord­ing to the Korea Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Ad­min­is­tra­tion (KMA).</p>
    <p>The mer­cury is ex­pected to drop to as low as mi­nus 20 deg C by to­mor­row and is ex­pected to rise above zero only on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The cap­i­tal’s south­ern Seo­cho dis­trict got the most snow, 13.7cm from Wed­nes­day evening to early yes­ter­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>In the more ru­ral north-eastern Gang­won prov­ince, Mount Se­o­rak recorded mi­nus 29.4 deg C.</p>
    <p>A cold wave warn­ing was is­sued na­tion­wide on Wed­nes­day night – the first time in three years.</p>
    <p>The KMA said the plum­met­ing mer­cury is caused by cold air flow­ing down from near Siberia, but some ex­perts also at­trib­uted it to a lower car­bon foot­print last year, with fac­to­ries shut­ting down dur­ing the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Heavy snow con­tin­ued across the na­tion yes­ter­day, caus­ing at least 86 flights to be can­celled at Gimpo In­ter­na­tional Air­port, west of the cap­i­tal. In­cheon In­ter­na­tional Air­port also re­ported seven flights can­celled as at 4pm.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day morn­ing, traf­fic was af­fected, with se­vere con­ges­tion re­ported. Wary of slip­pery roads, cars moved at an av­er­age speed of 19kmh.</p>
    <p>Sub­way trains were de­layed by break­downs, and some doors were stuck in the freez­ing cold.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Chung Sye-kyun has is­sued an emer­gency order to speed up snow re­moval work to avoid fur­ther traf­fic dis­rup­tions.</p>
    <p>More than 8,000 ve­hi­cles have been de­ployed along with some 17,000 peo­ple to clear the snow.</p>
    <p>The cold wave came as South Korea con­tin­ues to bat­tle a third surge of Covid-19 in­fec­tions that has pushed the to­tal num­ber of cases up to 66,686.</p>
    <p>The health au­thor­i­ties said the in­fec­tion curve is fi­nally start­ing to flat­ten due to tight­ened so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules, which in­cludes a ban on so­cial gath­er­ings of more than four peo­ple, and ag­gres­sive pre-emp­tive test­ing.</p>
    <p>Wed­nes­day’s snow­fall was wel­comed by many peo­ple, who took to so­cial me­dia to post self­ies and videos.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren could be heard laugh­ing as they dashed out to make snow­men or sledge on small slopes in the neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>Mr Phua, who has lived in Seoul for five years, said this is the first time that he has wit­nessed such heavy snow­fall in the city.</p>
    <p>He de­cided to walk home as road traf­fic in the posh dis­trict of Gang­nam, where he lives and works, was hardly mov­ing.</p>
    <p>“Plus the snow was quite a rare sight, so I just wanted to en­joy the walk home,” he said.</p>
    <p>Along the way, he saw peo­ple slip­ping and fall­ing.</p>
    <p>He also saw peo­ple push­ing ve­hi­cles that had stalled in the snow.</p>
    <p>“I felt re­ally bad for the peo­ple who got stuck try­ing to get home,” he said, adding that some of his friends took up to six hours to get home.</p>
    <p>“But it was also quite funny, like when I saw this de­liv­ery guy rid­ing a scooter with his whole body cov­ered in snow.”</p>
