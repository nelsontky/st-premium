    <p>China has urged the United States to aban­don its “Cold War” men­tal­ity, ac­cus­ing US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo of ma­li­ciously cre­at­ing po­lit­i­cal con­fronta­tion and smear­ing Bei­jing. Mr Pom­peo had on Tues­day called for deeper co­op­er­a­tion with Aus­tralia, In­dia and Ja­pan to counter China’s grow­ing re­gional in­flu­ence.</p>
    <p>China has said that the United States should stop its un­pro­voked at­tacks and ac­cu­sa­tions against China, ac­cus­ing US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo of ma­li­ciously cre­at­ing po­lit­i­cal con­fronta­tion and smear­ing Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo on Tues­day vis­ited Ja­pan and called for deeper co­op­er­a­tion with Aus­tralia, In­dia and Ja­pan to counter China’s grow­ing re­gional in­flu­ence.</p>
    <p>“Pom­peo has re­peat­edly fab­ri­cated lies about China and ma­li­ciously cre­ated po­lit­i­cal con­fronta­tion,” the Chi­nese Em­bassy in Ja­pan said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We once again urge the US to aban­don its Cold War men­tal­ity and ide­o­log­i­cal prej­u­dice, stop un­pro­voked ac­cu­sa­tions and at­tacks against China and treat re­la­tions with China in a con­struc­tive man­ner,” the em­bassy said.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo’s East Asia visit, his first in more than a year, co­in­cides with Washington’s wors­en­ing ten­sions with Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>The US and China, the world’s top two economies, are at log­ger­heads over a wide range of is­sues – from Bei­jing’s han­dling of the coro­n­avirus to its im­po­si­tion of a new se­cu­rity law in Hong Kong to its am­bi­tions in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo’s call for the Quad na­tions of the US, Ja­pan, In­dia and Aus­tralia to form a united front against China’s grow­ing in­flu­ence is a sen­si­tive sub­ject for Washington’s re­gional al­lies, which are re­liant on China for trade.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian For­eign Min­is­ter Marise Payne on Tues­day had a sep­a­rate meet­ing with Mr Pom­peo, and the two dis­cussed their shared con­cerns re­gard­ing China’s ac­tiv­i­ties in the Indo-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>A state­ment about the meet­ing de­scribed their dis­cus­sions of “China’s ma­lign ac­tiv­ity in the re­gion”.</p>
    <p>Ms Payne’s com­ments on Face­book about the meet­ing did not call out China by name, but her im­pli­ca­tion was clear.</p>
    <p>“Whether it is in­di­vid­ual hu­man rights, mar­ket-based economies, coun­ter­ing dis­in­for­ma­tion or build­ing greater re­silience into our sup­ply chains,” she wrote, “our com­mon val­ues and in­ter­ests mean we share a vi­sion for a free, open and pros­per­ous Indo-Pa­cific.”</p>
    <p>Diplo­mats and an­a­lysts know well that vari­a­tions on the catch­phrase “free and open Indo-Pa­cific” – which was in­voked in re­marks by Ms Payne, Ja­panese For­eign Min­is­ter Toshim­itsu Motegi, and In­dian For­eign Min­is­ter Subrah­manyam Jais­hankar – are all di­rected at China.</p>
    <p>In Tokyo, at the start of the Quad meet­ing yes­ter­day with Ms Payne, Mr Motegi said Ja­pan and Aus­tralia have a spe­cial, strate­gic part­ner­ship and the co­op­er­a­tion pos­si­bil­i­ties are great.</p>
    <p>Mr Motegi gave no fur­ther de­tails.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese min­is­ter also told Dr Jais­hankar yes­ter­day that Ja­pan will re­tain a strong em­pha­sis on strate­gic ties with In­dia un­der the new ad­min­is­tra­tion of Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to Mr Motegi’s re­marks, Dr Jais­hankar wel­comed the chance to re­view the two na­tions’ “very spe­cial part­ner­ship”, but did not elab­o­rate.</p>
    <p>We once again urge the US to aban­don its Cold War men­tal­ity and ide­o­log­i­cal prej­u­dice, stop un­pro­voked ac­cu­sa­tions and at­tacks against China and treat re­la­tions with China in a con­struc­tive man­ner.</p>
