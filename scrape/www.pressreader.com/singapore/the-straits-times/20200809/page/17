        Home | The Sunday Times Sunday, August 9, 2020 | A17 National Day celebratio­ns Overseas Singaporea­ns join in to mark special day manager of an events company in Jakarta, said the Zoom celebratio­n was a good way for his two sons, aged three and five, to learn about what is happening in Singapore.
“They got to see the painting that was done in appreciati­on of frontline workers back home and learnt about what the five stars on the Sin- gapore flag symbolise,” said Mr Chwee.
“Hopefully this imbues a sense of belonging in them when they return to perform national service.”
Over in New Zealand, undergradu­ate Lily Song, 18, had a potluck gathering on Friday with around 30 other students from the Singapore Students’ Associatio­n in Auckland.
“It was really fun. We talked about our experience­s living in Singapore and how it’s different here in New Zealand,” said Ms Song.
“And someone brought really good curry puffs,” she added. Wong Shiying While people in Singapore will be watching the National Day Parade show from the comfort of their homes, 25-year-old master’s student Liaw Su Xin will be catching the live show in the middle of a dense forest.
She would have just completed a 15km hike from Hoge Veluwe National Park to Arnhem i n the Netherland­s, and is planning to watch the virtual performanc­e while having a picnic of kaya toast and half-boiled eggs.
“I wanted to do this because I love nature, and being surrounded by greenery reminds of Singapore,” said Ms Liaw.
The hike will take about four hours and Ms Liaw will be accompanie­d by a friend from China who is excited to join her in the National Day festivitie­s.
In London, technology risk associate Gloria Ee, 24, felt lonely when most of her Singaporea­n friends returned home before the United Kingdom went into lockdown.
National Day will be extra special for Ms Ee as her friend of 12 years, who is also Singaporea­n, will be travelling two hours by train from Birmingham to celebrate the occasion with her.
They will be whipping up their favourite l ocal dishes like fried Hokkien mee and baking pineapple tarts to share with neighbours.
Ms Ee, who recently discovered a joy for cooking during the lockdown, went the extra mile to source for fresh ingredient­s.
“They don’t sell pre-made j am here so I bought pineapples and made my own. I also bought fresh whole prawns from a local seafood market on Thursday.”
A young family in Japan will also be celebratin­g the city state’s birthday with some of its beloved dishes.
Internatio­nal school teacher Ong Ruo Ning, 28, will be cooking Hainanese chicken rice today, paired with peppery bak kut teh for her husband and their threemonth-old son. They will enjoy their meal while tuning in to the online celebratio­n on Zoom organised by the Singapore Embassy in Tokyo.
