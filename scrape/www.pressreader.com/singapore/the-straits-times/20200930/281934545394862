    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s higher ed­u­ca­tion scene re­ceived a wel­come shake-up with the an­nounce­ment that the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) would be bring­ing to­gether two of its fac­ul­ties to form a new in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary col­lege next year. It has been pro­posed that the Fac­ulty of Arts and So­cial Sciences be brought to­gether with the Fac­ulty of Science to form the Col­lege of Hu­man­i­ties and Sciences. The move is a step in the right di­rec­tion. Univer­sity stu­dents de­serve an ed­u­ca­tion that crosses dis­ci­plinary di­vides in an age when the econ­omy re­quires work­ers who can think out of sin­gle method­olog­i­cal boxes, no mat­ter how sound and time-hal­lowed they might be.</p>
    <p>Both NUS fac­ul­ties date as far back as 1929, and they are well re­garded for their pool of spe­cial­i­sa­tions, from psy­chol­ogy and history to math­e­mat­ics and life sciences. How­ever, there is ur­gency in the need to pre­serve sub­ject spe­cial­i­sa­tion but to also make it a part of in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary teach­ing and re­search. The ob­jec­tive would be to pro­duce grad­u­ates who pos­sess core skills and knowl­edge while re­main­ing adapt­able to chang­ing con­di­tions of life and work. The hard con­tours of schol­arly in­quiry in the nat­u­ral sciences pro­vide the con­cep­tual mi­cro­cosm of a world de­fined by a fini­tude of re­sources. The hu­man­i­ties and the so­cial sciences of­fer imag­i­na­tive and ame­lio­ra­tive so­lu­tions for some of the harsh peren­ni­als of the hu­man con­di­tion. Both ap­proaches are re­quired.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to one anal­y­sis of in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary learn­ing, it boasts four ad­van­tages. It en­cour­ages stu­dents to recog­nise bias, think crit­i­cally, tol­er­ate am­bi­gu­ity, and to ac­knowl­edge and ap­pre­ci­ate eth­i­cal con­cerns. It is not that young adults are un­fa­mil­iar with the di­ver­gent na­ture of hu­man needs. How­ever, the ex­clu­sive struc­tures of aca­demic dis­ci­plines might make them favour one view of the world over oth­ers. To think crit­i­cally is to ac­knowl­edge the bias that is in­her­ent in pre­con­ceived no­tions and to be alert to am­bi­gu­ity, or the pres­ence of al­ter­na­tive per­spec­tives on so­cial is­sues. Since some aca­demic dis­ci­plines might treat moral con­cerns as be­ing sub­jec­tive and there­fore sec­ondary, eth­i­cal con­sid­er­a­tions draw at­ten­tion to moral think­ing in the minds of stu­dents in an in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary at­mos­phere where no sub­ject en­joys a priv­i­leged po­si­tion over oth­ers.</p>
    <p>It is heart­en­ing that uni­ver­si­ties in Sin­ga­pore, as do many abroad, al­ready have courses that strad­dle dis­ci­plines so as to of­fer un­der­grad­u­ates a broad-based ed­u­ca­tion. The lib­eral arts ap­proach, pop­u­lar in the United States, is a promis­ing one be­cause it obliges stu­dents to break out of dis­ci­plinary si­los, such as the pure hu­man­i­ties or the hard sciences or the so­cial sciences. In the process, they de­velop both spe­cialised and soft skills that are nec­es­sary for sur­vival and suc­cess in the job mar­ket. Sin­ga­pore must keep abreast of changes in global ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
