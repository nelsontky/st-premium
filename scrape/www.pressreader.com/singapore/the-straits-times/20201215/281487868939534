    <p>A CHANCE TO IRON OUT IS­SUES</p>
    <p>The re­cent dis­rup­tion of TEL prompted LTA to re­view the soft­ware of the sys­tem, which con­tributed to the de­lay, more thor­oughly with our con­trac­tor. As rail sys­tems are com­plex, it is bet­ter that we try to iron out as many teething is­sues as pos­si­ble be­fore open­ing the next phase. This is a key rea­son why TEL is be­ing opened in phases.</p>
    <p>LAND TRANS­PORT AU­THOR­ITY, re­fer­ring to the Dec 4 dis­rup­tion to train ser­vices be­tween Wood­lands North and Wood­lands South sta­tions on the Thom­son-East Coast Line due to a sig­nalling fault.</p>
    <p>A sig­nalling fault that dis­rupted train ser­vices on the Thom­son-East Coast Line (TEL) on Dec 4 has led to a de­lay in the open­ing of the sec­ond stage of the line.</p>
    <p>It has been pushed back by an­other six months till the third quar­ter of next year for a more thor­ough re­view of the rail sys­tem soft­ware, said the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA) yesterday.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, other ma­jor rail and road in­fras­truc­ture projects are also fac­ing de­lays – of up to a year – be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the LTA added in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Those af­fected in­clude the third and fourth stages of the TEL, Cross Is­land Line, Jurong Re­gion Line, Cir­cle Line Stage 6 and the North-South Cor­ri­dor ex­press­way net­work which links the north­ern parts of the is­land to the city cen­tre.</p>
    <p>A ma­jor cause of the de­lays is the sus­pen­sion of work dur­ing the eight-week cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, which ended on June 1.</p>
    <p>Other fac­tors cited by the LTA in­clude dis­rup­tions to the global sup­ply chain for con­struc­tion ma­te­ri­als and a gen­eral man­power crunch ow­ing to bor­der clo­sures.</p>
    <p>The LTA said the re­vised com­ple­tion and open­ing time­lines for th­ese projects are still be­ing fi­nalised, and it will is­sue up­dates in due course.</p>
    <p>Ex­plain­ing the TEL de­lay, it said: “The re­cent dis­rup­tion of TEL prompted LTA to re­view the soft­ware of the sys­tem, which con­tributed to the de­lay, more thor­oughly with our con­trac­tor.</p>
    <p>“As rail sys­tems are com­plex, it is bet­ter that we try to iron out as many teething is­sues as pos­si­ble be­fore open­ing the next phase. This is a key rea­son why TEL is be­ing opened in phases.”</p>
    <p>The sig­nalling prob­lem dis­rupted train ser­vices be­tween Wood­lands North and Wood­lands South sta­tions for more than five hours on the morn­ing of Dec 4, in­clud­ing peak hours.</p>
    <p>To­gether with Wood­lands sta­tion, the two sta­tions fall un­der the first stage of the TEL, which has been open since Jan 31.</p>
    <p>TEL op­er­a­tor SMRT later said the fault was caused by a soft­ware glitch in the sig­nalling sys­tem’s net­work com­po­nent, which had to be re­con­fig­ured be­fore the sys­tem could be re­set.</p>
    <p>This lat­est de­lay is the sec­ond set­back for TEL’s sec­ond stage, which in­volves six sta­tions from Springleaf to Calde­cott. The first was a three-month de­lay, with the com­ple­tion date pushed back from the end of this year to the first quar­ter of next year.</p>
    <p>Yesterday, the LTA said con­struc­tion has pro­gres­sively re­sumed at all its work sites since June 2. “Our con­trac­tors have been ad­her­ing to strict safe man­age­ment mea­sures at work sites, in­clud­ing manda­tory daily tem­per­a­ture mon­i­tor­ing, us­ing SafeEn­try or TraceTo­gether to check in and out, as well as en­sur­ing work is car­ried out in groups of no more than five work­ers with no in­ter­min­gling be­tween groups.”</p>
    <p>Mr Sak­tiandi Su­paat, chair­man of the Gov­ern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee for Trans­port, told The Straits Times yesterday that the de­lay is un­der­stand­able given the pan­demic sit­u­a­tion. It is im­por­tant to have a thor­ough re­view of the sys­tem and soft­ware to en­sure things are done prop­erly, he said.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment will ex­pand the MRT net­work sig­nif­i­cantly, from around 230km to­day to 360km by the early 2030s. This in­cludes open­ing the re­main­ing stages of the TEL, Cir­cle Line Stage 6, the North East Line ex­ten­sion, Jurong Re­gion Line and Cross Is­land Line.</p>
    <p>Orig­i­nally slated to be com­pleted by 2024, the TEL – Singapore’s sixth MRT line – is ex­pected to serve about 500,000 com­muters daily in its ini­tial years.</p>
    <p>The Cir­cle Line Stage 6 ex­ten­sion was orig­i­nally slated to be op­er­a­tional in 2025, while the first stage of the Cross Is­land Line was to be ready by 2029. The North-South Cor­ri­dor was slated to be ready by end-2026 be­fore Covid-19 forced the de­lay.</p>
