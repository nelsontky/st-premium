    <p>WASHINGTON The United States has im­posed sanc­tions on In­ter­na­tional Crim­i­nal Court (ICC) pros­e­cu­tor Fa­tou Ben­souda, Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo said, over her in­ves­ti­ga­tion into whether Amer­i­can forces com­mit­ted war crimes in Afghanista­n.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo added on Wed­nes­day that Mr Phak­iso Mo­cho­choko, head of the ICC’s Ju­ris­dic­tion, Com­ple­men­tar­ity and Co­op­er­a­tion Divi­sion, had also been black­listed un­der sanc­tions au­tho­rised by Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump in June that al­low for as­set freezes and travel bans.</p>
    <p>He also said that in­di­vid­u­als and en­ti­ties that con­tinue to ma­te­ri­ally sup­port Ms Ben­souda and Mr Mo­cho­choko would risk ex­po­sure to sanc­tions as well.</p>
    <p>The ICC dis­missed the mea­sures as “an­other at­tempt to in­ter­fere with the court’s ju­di­cial and pros­e­cu­to­rial in­de­pen­dence”.</p>
    <p>“These co­er­cive acts, di­rected at an in­ter­na­tional ju­di­cial in­sti­tu­tion and its civil ser­vants, are un­prece­dented and con­sti­tute se­ri­ous attacks against the court, the Rome Statute sys­tem of in­ter­na­tional crim­i­nal jus­tice, and the rule of law more gen­er­ally,” it said in a rare joint state­ment on behalf of the en­tire ICC.</p>
    <p>The State Depart­ment also re­stricted the is­suance of visas for in­di­vid­u­als that Mr Pom­peo said were in­volved in the court’s ef­forts to in­ves­ti­gate US per­son­nel.</p>
    <p>United Na­tions Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral An­to­nio Guter­res was con­cerned by Mr Pom­peo’s an­nounce­ment, UN spokesman Stephane Du­jar­ric told re­porters.</p>
    <p>Mr Du­jar­ric said “we trust that any re­stric­tion taken against in­di­vid­u­als will be im­ple­mented con­sis­tently” with a decades-old US deal with the UN to host the world body’s head­quar­ters in New York.</p>
    <p>Ms Ben­souda was given the goa­head by the court in March to in­ves­ti­gate whether war crimes were com­mit­ted in Afghanista­n by the Tale­ban, Afghan mil­i­tary and US forces.</p>
    <p>The US re­voked her en­try visa last year over the pos­si­ble Afghanista­n in­quiry. But un­der an agree­ment be­tween the UN and Washington, she was still able to reg­u­larly travel to New York to brief the UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil on cases it had re­ferred to the court in The Hague.</p>
    <p>Mr Richard Dicker, Hu­man Rights Watch in­ter­na­tional jus­tice di­rec­tor, said: “The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has twisted these sanc­tions to ob­struct jus­tice, not only for cer­tain war crimes vic­tims, but for atroc­ity vic­tims any­where look­ing to the In­ter­na­tional Crim­i­nal Court for jus­tice,” he said.</p>
