    <p>Sales of Hous­ing Board re­sale flats re­mained strong last month, with five units chang­ing hands for at least $1 mil­lion, as prices grew at the fastest monthly rate since Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>There were 1.4 per cent fewer HDB re­sale flats sold last month com­pared with July, but this vol­ume was 23.5 per cent higher than in the same month last year.</p>
    <p>In all, there were 2,435 HDB re­sale trans­ac­tions last month, flash es­ti­mates from real es­tate por­tal SRX showed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Of the HDB flats sold l ast month, 40.3 per cent were four­room flats, 26 per cent were five­room flats, 23.2 per cent were three-room flats and 8.8 per cent were ex­ec­u­tive flats. The rest of the trans­ac­tions in­volved multi­gen­er­a­tion and two-room flats.</p>
    <p>OrangeTee & Tie head of re­search and con­sul­tancy Chris­tine Sun said the HDB re­sale mar­ket re­mained strong last month de­spite the Hun­gry Ghost Fes­ti­val that takes place from Aug 19 to Sept 16, which typ­i­cally sees lower sales ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>“The strong sales vol­ume over the past three months is not likely to be a ‘ blip’ af­ter the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Mar­ket sen­ti­ment could be slowly re­cov­er­ing since the virus out­break is sta­bil­is­ing in Sin­ga­pore, and some sec­tors are start­ing to ex­pe­ri­ence a busi­ness turn­around af­ter the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.”</p>
    <p>Data from SRX showed a 0.7 per cent in­crease in last month’s re­sale prices com­pared with July’s.</p>
    <p>Au­gust’s re­sale prices were 2.1 per cent higher than those of the same month last year, but 12.1 per cent lower than the peak for HDB re­sale prices in April 2013.</p>
    <p>Prices in non-ma­ture es­tates rose by 3.3 per cent year on year, while those in ma­ture es­tates rose by 0.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>ERA Realty head of re­search and con­sul­tancy Nicholas Mak said the in­crease in the HDB re­sale price in­dex last month rep­re­sented the high­est rate of monthly growth since Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>He said: “The growth in the price in­dex was con­trib­uted by the re­sale trans­ac­tions of HDB flats that re­cently com­pleted the five-year min­i­mum oc­cu­pa­tion pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“These newer flats would usu­ally com­mand higher prices than the older flats in the vicin­ity.”</p>
    <p>A five-room flat at Pin­na­cle@Dux­ton recorded the high­est trans­acted price for a re­sale flat last month – at $1,185,000.</p>
    <p>It was one of five HDB re­sale flats that sold for at least $1 mil­lion that month.</p>
    <p>An ex­ec­u­tive maisonette flat in Hougang sold for $890,000 in what was the high­est re­sale price for non-ma­ture es­tates.</p>
    <p>Data from SRX also showed that the over­all me­dian trans­ac­tion over X-value (TOX) was a pos­i­tive $3,000 last month, an in­crease of $2,000 com­pared with July.</p>
    <p>Me­dian TOX mea­sures whether peo­ple are over­pay­ing (in the case of pos­i­tive TOX) or un­der­pay­ing (when there is neg­a­tive TOX) rel­a­tive to the SRX Prop­erty X-value es­ti­mated mar­ket value for flats.</p>
    <p>Flats in Bukit Ba­tok recorded the high­est me­dian TOX, at pos­i­tive $10,500, while those i n Kal­lang/Wham­poa recorded the low­est me­dian TOX, at neg­a­tive $4,000.</p>
