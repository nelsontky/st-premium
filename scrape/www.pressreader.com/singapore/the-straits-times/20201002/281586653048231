    <p>Some 5,870 jobs in the pro­fes­sional ser­vices sec­tor have been on of­fer to job seek­ers since April, with four in five for pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians. The Govern­ment will of­fer sub­stan­tial salary sup­port un­der the jobs growth in­cen­tive scheme, which would sup­port two-thirds of the job op­por­tu­ni­ties in pro­fes­sional ser­vices, if the el­i­gi­bil­ity cri­te­ria are met.</p>
    <p>Even as Covid-19 con­tin­ues to bat­ter the econ­omy, some 5,870 largely high-pay­ing jobs have been on of­fer since April in pro­fes­sional ser­vices, which is a high-growth sec­tor for Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Four in five of these roles are for pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs), Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said while shar­ing the sev­enth edi­tion of her weekly jobs sit­u­a­tion re­port yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment will of­fer sub­stan­tial salary sup­port un­der the jobs growth in­cen­tive scheme to en­cour­age em­ploy­ers to bring for­ward their hir­ing plans and hire more lo­cal work­ers, she said.</p>
    <p>It takes time to fill PMET va­can­cies. “We have no­ticed con­sis­tently for all of the SGUnited jobs that have been made avail­able, for PMET roles, it takes a longer time for them to be filled, and this is not sur­pris­ing be­cause com­pa­nies... are tak­ing on a big­ger com­mit­ment and they want to find the right fit,” said Mrs Teo.</p>
    <p>The jobs growth in­cen­tive, which lasts till Fe­bru­ary, could be a game changer. It would sup­port twothirds of the job op­por­tu­ni­ties in pro­fes­sional ser­vices – which cov­ers ar­chi­tec­ture, en­gi­neer­ing, con­sul­tancy, ac­coun­tancy, de­sign, ad­ver­tis­ing and mar­ket­ing – if the el­i­gi­bil­ity cri­te­ria are met.</p>
    <p>“This has al­ready spurred firms that pro­vide au­dit and ad­vi­sory ad­vice to hire ad­di­tional Sin­ga­pore­ans in Septem­ber,” said Mrs Teo.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to jobs, about 2,070 com­pany-hosted trainee­ships and at­tach­ments and 1,080 train­ing places have been avail­able in the sec­tor. “Even for firms that may not be ready to hire, they have gra­ciously stepped for­ward to host fresh grad­u­ates or mid-ca­reer in­di­vid­u­als in trainee­ships and at­tach­ment roles,” said Mrs Teo.</p>
    <p>So far, about 1,400 of the op­por­tu­ni­ties in the sec­tor have been taken up.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo’s weekly job re­ports, which started on Aug 11, have high­lighted a to­tal of 22,800 jobs and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties in sec­tors such as man­u­fac­tur­ing, bio­med­i­cal sci­ence, tourism and food.</p>
    <p>So far, about 4,230 peo­ple have been placed in these op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>In yes­ter­day’s re­port, Mrs Teo noted that the im­pact of Covid-19 has been un­even in the pro­fes­sional ser­vices in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>In ar­chi­tec­ture and en­gi­neer­ing, for ex­am­ple, ac­tiv­ity lev­els “fell sharply” as most con­struc­tion works were put on hold dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod. And among law firms, about 70 per cent re­ported a de­crease in work, ac­cord­ing to a Law So­ci­ety of Sin­ga­pore sur­vey, said Mrs Teo.</p>
    <p>But con­sul­tancy, de­sign, ad­ver­tis­ing and mar­ket­ing ser­vices with dig­i­tal ex­per­tise have been in de­mand due to the ac­cel­er­ated pace of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion brought about by Covid-19, said Mrs Teo.</p>
    <p>Specif­i­cally, in con­sul­tancy, there has been an in­creased de­mand for tech­nol­ogy and cy­ber-se­cu­rity ex­per­tise, she added.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the ad­ver­tis­ing and mar­ket­ing sub-sec­tor is see­ing high de­mand for roles such as con­tent strate­gists, com­mu­nity man­agers and com­mer­cial and mar­ket­ing sales ex­ec­u­tives.</p>
    <p>In de­sign ser­vices, roles in user ex­pe­ri­ence and user in­ter­face de­sign are gain­ing promi­nence.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, speak­ing at a visit to PwC Sin­ga­pore, Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Chan Chun Sing said: “The pro­fes­sional ser­vices sec­tor un­der­pins our sta­tus as a busi­ness hub, and how well it does will also de­ter­mine and shape the fu­ture tra­jec­tory of Sin­ga­pore’s growth.”</p>
    <p>But the sec­tor had be­come glob­ally con­nected, said Mr Chan, which meant that while Sin­ga­pore­ans could fight for busi­ness else­where, oth­ers could also fight for mar­ket share here.</p>
    <p>To stay com­pet­i­tive, he said, Sin­ga­pore would keep work­ing on its net­work of free trade agree­ments to ac­cess other mar­kets.</p>
    <p>It would also seek to strengthen the ca­pa­bil­i­ties of its work­ers.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans, too, should try to seek over­seas ex­po­sure in or­der to thrive in the pro­fes­sional ser­vices sec­tor, said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>Top pro­fes­sional ser­vices firms like PwC, KPMG and Bos­ton Con­sult­ing can op­er­ate from any­where in the world, and it is im­por­tant for Sin­ga­pore to re­main at­trac­tive to such busi­nesses so that its peo­ple have op­por­tu­ni­ties to de­velop their po­ten­tial, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to re­porters on a visit to PwC’s of­fice in Ma­rina One, he cited three fac­tors that at­tract such firms here: ac­cess to tal­ent, con­nec­tiv­ity and in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore’s rep­u­ta­tion as a hub for tal­ent is hard-won. But at the same time, this rep­u­ta­tion can also be eas­ily lost if we are not care­ful,” he said, un­der­lin­ing the need for the coun­try to look at strength­en­ing its abil­ity to grow and at­tract tal­ent to serve the global mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore must also strengthen its con­nec­tiv­ity – i nclud­ing in terms of flows of data, fi­nance and tech­nol­ogy, he said.</p>
    <p>“If we con­tinue to do this well, then we have ev­ery op­por­tu­nity to con­tinue to ex­cel as a global busi­ness hub with a very strong, vi­brant pro­fes­sional ser­vices sec­tor.”</p>
    <p>With Mr Chan on the visit were Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo and Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice In­dra­nee Ra­jah.</p>
    <p>It is part of an on­go­ing se­ries of vis­its to com­pa­nies in key sec­tors to look at how they are far­ing amid the cri­sis and mak­ing ad­just­ments for a post-Covid-19 world.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan noted that the pro­fes­sional ser­vices sec­tor un­der­pins Sin­ga­pore’s sta­tus as a busi­ness hub, and how well it does will de­ter­mine and shape the fu­ture tra­jec­tory of Sin­ga­pore’s growth. It con­trib­uted 5.1 per cent to Sin­ga­pore’s nom­i­nal gross do­mes­tic prod­uct last year.</p>
    <p>“The sec­tor does not just cre­ate jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans in Sin­ga­pore, it also cre­ates very high val­ueadded and chal­leng­ing jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans be­yond Sin­ga­pore, and that is how we are able to grow our ex­ter­nal wing as well,” he said.</p>
    <p>He also noted that the sec­tor is one with lit­tle, if any, ge­o­graph­i­cal in­su­la­tion – mean­ing any­one, any­where can com­pete with Sin­ga­pore­ans or Sin­ga­pore busi­nesses without be­ing here.</p>
    <p>“It is all about who has the best team, who has the tal­ent, who is able to bet­ter con­nect with his clients and who can bet­ter in­no­vate. The com­pe­ti­tion is no longer lo­cal (or) on a sin­gle do­main.”</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter cited PwC as a good ex­am­ple of a firm that has trans­formed, pro­vid­ing a range of ser­vices that com­ple­ment one another.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan also said there is an op­por­tu­nity for Sin­ga­pore, with many com­pa­nies con­cerned about be­ing able to op­er­ate across dif­fer­ent mar­kets in a bi­fur­cat­ing or frag­ment­ing world. They find it im­por­tant to be based in a place where they can ser­vice dif­fer­ent parts of the global ecosys­tem, he noted.</p>
    <p>He out­lined var­i­ous ways in which Sin­ga­pore plans to strengthen its com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tage in the sec­tor.</p>
    <p>It is es­tab­lish­ing con­di­tions for the sec­tor to thrive, in­clud­ing build­ing a net­work of dig­i­tal econ­omy agree­ments that will help pro­fes­sional ser­vices firms ac­cess over­seas mar­kets, and strength­en­ing its work­ers’ com­pe­ten­cies.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore must also en­hance its peo­ple’s ex­po­sure to in­tern­ships over­seas, and con­tinue to en­cour­age ci­ti­zens to get re­gional ex­pe­ri­ence so that they can take up re­gional and global po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>And it has to be able to draw tal­ent here to con­trib­ute.</p>
    <p>He re­called how a busi­ness­man told him that while this may be the cri­sis of a gen­er­a­tion, it can also be “the op­por­tu­nity of a gen­er­a­tion for Sin­ga­pore to at­tract the very best from all around the world to come and join Team Sin­ga­pore”.</p>
    <p>This will cre­ate more op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans here as well as be­yond Sin­ga­pore, Mr Chan said.</p>
    <p>“We are com­mit­ted to strength­en­ing our at­trac­tive­ness to busi­nesses and tal­ent to (get them to) join Team Sin­ga­pore in or­der for us to ex­cel against our com­peti­tors,” he added.</p>
    <p>Ms In­dra­nee, who is also Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Fi­nance and Na­tional De­vel­op­ment, said that in the medium and longer term, pro­fes­sional ser­vices are a ma­jor growth area. “We do have the tal­ent and abil­ity here,” she said.</p>
    <p>She added that while 70 per cent of law firms re­ported a drop in work due to the re­ces­sion, ar­eas such as in­sol­vency, lit­i­ga­tion and dis­pute res­o­lu­tion ser­vices are pick­ing up.</p>
    <p>Cor­po­rate and trans­ac­tion work has taken more of a hit, “but there’s po­ten­tial for merg­ers and ac­qui­si­tions as in­vestors start to... look for the ones they can pick up and in­vest in”.</p>
    <p>What is cru­cial is help­ing law firms po­si­tion them­selves for fu­ture growth when the econ­omy picks up, as le­gal ser­vices de­mand will also re­cover, she added.</p>
