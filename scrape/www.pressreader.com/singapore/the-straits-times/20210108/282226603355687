    <p>•</p>
    <p>China’s tech com­pa­nies did a pretty good job con­vinc­ing global in­vestors that they op­er­ated in­de­pen­dently from the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party (CCP). Now, Mr Jack Ma has be­come a case study for the firms’ big­gest scep­tics.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies from Alibaba Group Hold­ing to Ten­cent Hold­ings splashed out bil­lions on over­seas ac­qui­si­tions while de­vel­op­ing apps and tech­nolo­gies that chal­lenged Western ri­vals, with lit­tle or no state in­ter­fer­ence. But Bei­jing’s pur­suit of Mr Ma and his Ant Group af­ter he crit­i­cised reg­u­la­tors ar­guably plays di­rectly into the hands of China’s big­gest crit­ics in Wash­ing­ton, who have long as­serted that no Chi­nese tech gi­ant or en­tre­pre­neur is be­yond the reach of Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping.</p>
    <p>The US au­thor­i­ties are now de­bat­ing whether to ban i nvest­ments in Alibaba and Ten­cent, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter, in what would be a dra­matic blow to two of the com­pa­nies whose shares are most widely held by global in­vestors.</p>
    <p>Al­ready on Tues­day, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump signed an ex­ec­u­tive order ban­ning trans­ac­tions with eight Chi­nese soft­ware ap­pli­ca­tions in­clud­ing Ant’s Ali­pay, and Ten­cent’s WeChat Pay, cit­ing con­cerns that Bei­jing will have ac­cess to the data col­lected by the plat­forms. “I stand with Pres­i­dent Trump’s com­mit­ment to pro­tect­ing the pri­vacy and se­cu­rity of Amer­i­cans from threats posed by the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party,” Com­merce Sec­re­tary Wil­bur Ross said in a state­ment on the order.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing’s moves could raise pres­sure on the in­com­ing Joe Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion to push through fur­ther ac­tion detri­men­tal to China, though it is not clear how much of Mr Trump’s ag­gres­sive poli­cies the Pres­i­dent-elect will con­tinue.</p>
    <p>The Com­mu­nist Party’s sway over busi­ness has be­come even clearer over the past 12 months as</p>
    <p>Mr Xi pushes to con­sol­i­date power ahead of next year’s big party congress, when he is ex­pected to ex­tend his rule for at least another five years. Covid-19 has only served to strengthen his grip, fu­elling a war-like cam­paign to steer the econ­omy back on track and snuff out per­ceived threats to na­tional se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>“You need to be very mind­ful of who ul­ti­mately con­trols reg­u­la­tions, who con­trols li­cens­ing – of who’s in charge,” said Mr Mark Natkin, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Bei­jing-based Mar­bridge Con­sult­ing.</p>
    <p>“And if you for­get and you start to be overly crit­i­cal or take too much of a role that nor­mally be­longs to the party, then you’re go­ing to get chopped down a notch or two.”</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has moved to fun­da­men­tally over­haul Mr Ma’s tril­lion-dol­lar In­ter­net em­pire since de­mol­ish­ing Ant’s US$35 bil­lion (S$46 bil­lion) initial public of­fer­ing (IPO) last Novem­ber, a record-break­ing de­but that was to have been the en­tre­pre­neur’s crown­ing achieve­ment. The au­thor­i­ties then forced his on­line fi­nance ti­tan to cap loans and de­vise a plan to hive off its most lu­cra­tive busi­nesses. The gov­ern­ment also launched a probe into al­leged anti-com­pet­i­tive prac­tices at Alibaba. The bil­lion­aire has not been seen in public since Novem­ber and his ab­sence from the re­cent tap­ing of an African TV pro­gramme he cre­ated spurred spec­u­la­tion of his where­abouts.</p>
    <p>“There is a lot of power in the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment’s eco­nomic and fi­nan­cial man­age­ment in­fra­struc­ture, and if Ant was go­ing to erode that power, im­por­tant peo­ple would see it as a step too far,” said Mr Gra­ham Web­ster, edi­tor of the DigiChina pro­ject at the Stan­ford Cy­ber Pol­icy Cen­tre. But “the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment also prizes th­ese lead­ing com­pa­nies as driv­ers of tech­no­log­i­cal in­de­pen­dence. The party would have to per­ceive sig­nif­i­cant threats to tear them down.”</p>
    <p>The ac­tion against Mr Ma sends the lat­est sig­nal that Bei­jing feels em­bold­ened to risk in­ter­na­tional fall­out from mea­sures meant to ad­dress do­mes­tic chal­lenges. Mr Xi has pre­vi­ously de­fied threats of US sanc­tions to im­pose sweep­ing na­tional se­cu­rity leg­is­la­tion on the for­mer Bri­tish colony of Hong Kong. Crush­ing Ant’s IPO risked alien­at­ing a plethora of pow­er­ful global fi­nanciers from Sin­ga­pore’s sov­er­eign wealth fund to Car­lyle.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton has also cited con­cerns about Chi­nese gov­ern­ment in­flu­ence over pri­vate in­dus­try to jus­tify its ef­forts to force ByteDance to sell the Amer­i­can share of its TikTok so­cial net­work and the global cam­paign to con­vince al­lies to swear off equip­ment</p>
    <p>made by Huawei Tech­nolo­gies. Sup­port­ers of such ac­tions of­ten cite Chi­nese poli­cies such as a 2017 law that re­quires com­pa­nies to “sup­port, as­sist and co­op­er­ate” with in­tel­li­gence agen­cies.</p>
    <p>Like Huawei, Ant has also as­serted its in­de­pen­dence from the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment, say­ing in a 2017 ap­pli­ca­tion to the US se­cu­ri­ties reg­u­la­tor that it is “a pri­vate sec­tor com­pany and while a hand­ful of Chi­nese state-owned or af­fil­i­ated funds own non-con­trol­ling mi­nor­ity stakes, they do not par­tic­i­pate in com­pany man­age­ment”.</p>
    <p>The party has long reached into pri­vate firms, in­clud­ing for­eign ones op­er­at­ing in China. One way it does that is through the pres­ence of party com­mit­tees in com­pa­nies, among them tech en­ter­prises, that are made up of em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, it dis­patches of­fi­cials to com­pa­nies to over­see cer­tain ac­tiv­i­ties. Many tech lead­ers also be­long to the CCP, in­clud­ing Mr Ma, Len­ovo founder Liu Chuanzhi and Huawei’s Ren Zhengfei. Ten­cent’s Pony Ma and Xiaomi’s Lei Jun are both del­e­gates to the Na­tional Peo­ple’s Congress.</p>
    <p>The party has also stepped in on sev­eral oc­ca­sions to pun­ish ex­ec­u­tives for mis­man­age­ment, in­clud­ing An­bang In­sur­ance Group’s Wu Xiao­hui.</p>
    <p>But re­cent party ef­forts to ex­ert gov­ern­ment in­flu­ence over com­pa­nies and in­ter­vene in the busi­ness land­scape have reached new lev­els. That has pro­vided fuel to the China hawks in Wash­ing­ton, who ar­gue that the CCP ex­erts too much in­flu­ence over Chi­nese com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi needs busi­ness ex­ec­u­tives on his side to achieve strate­gic goals such as the “dual-cir­cula</p>
    <p>tion” eco­nomic plan fo­cused on do­mes­tic con­sump­tion, de­vel­op­ing se­cure sup­ply chains and re­duc­ing re­liance on for­eign tech­nol­ogy. While the world’s sec­ond-largest econ­omy was the first to re­bound from Covid-19, its re­cov­ery is show­ing signs of peak­ing even as global growth re­mains slug­gish and ties with the US stay fraught.</p>
    <p>In a rare di­rect plea to the busi­ness sec­tor in July, Mr Xi urged ex­ec­u­tives in­clud­ing those from the tech in­dus­try to be more pa­tri­otic and help the post-pan­demic eco­nomic re­cov­ery. “Out­stand­ing en­trepreneur­s must have a strong sense of mis­sion and re­spon­si­bil­ity for the na­tion, and align their busi­nesses’ de­vel­op­ment with the pros­per­ity of the na­tion and the hap­pi­ness of the peo­ple,” he said.</p>
    <p>Weeks later, the party re­vealed plans to tighten con­trol over the pri­vate sec­tor by ex­tend­ing its United Front net­work­ing op­er­a­tions fur­ther into the busi­ness com­mu­nity. The pol­icy will “strengthen ide­o­log­i­cal guid­ance” and “cre­ate a core group of pri­vate sec­tor lead­ers who can be re­lied upon dur­ing crit­i­cal times”, ac­cord­ing to guide­lines pub­lished at the time.</p>
    <p>“Un­der Pres­i­dent Xi, the CCP has tight­ened its grip over tech com­pa­nies and dou­bled down on its techno-na­tion­al­ist ini­tia­tives,” re­searcher Alex Capri wrote in a re­cent re­port for the Hin­rich Foun­da­tion. “In ad­di­tion to plac­ing party of­fi­cials within prom­i­nent com­pa­nies, it con­tin­ues to neuter high­pro­file cor­po­rate ex­ec­u­tives where there is the per­cep­tion that they were op­er­at­ing in­de­pen­dently from party di­rec­tive or be­com­ing too in­flu­en­tial.”</p>
    <p>TIGHT LEASH</p>
    <p>You need to be very mind­ful of who ul­ti­mately con­trols reg­u­la­tions, who con­trols li­cens­ing – of who’s in charge. And if you for­get and you start to be overly crit­i­cal or take too much of a role that nor­mally be­longs to the party, then you’re go­ing to get chopped down a notch or two.</p>
    <p>MR MARK NATKIN, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Bei­jing-based Mar­bridge Con­sult­ing, on the CCP’s con­trol over Chi­nese com­pa­nies.</p>
