    <p>Hu­man re­source (HR) pro­fes­sion­als will get more sup­port for up­skilling as part of ef­forts to en­sure that they are equip­ped to har­ness the bene­fits of tech trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>To do so, the In­sti­tute for Hu­man Re­source Pro­fes­sion­als (IHRP) will de­velop more and dif­fer­ent learn­ing av­enues for HR pro­fes­sion­als, with a greater fo­cus on emerg­ing skills, said Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Man­power Zaqy Mo­hamad yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This was one of the rec­om­men­da­tions by the HR In­dus­try Trans­for­ma­tion Ad­vi­sory Panel (HRTAP) to help build a stronger HR sec­tor in Sin­ga­pore to en­able busi­ness and work­force trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The panel was con­vened last year to come up with ways for HR pro­fes­sion­als to use more tech­nol­ogy as they help work­ers and busi­nesses trans­form.</p>
    <p>It aims to have more than 10,000 HR pro­fes­sion­als take up IHRP or equiv­a­lent cer­ti­fi­ca­tion, and con­fer 10,000 skills badges in emerg­ing skills such as data-led tal­ent ac­qui­si­tion by 2025, Mr Zaqy said.</p>
    <p>“Through up­skilling and sup­port­ing busi­ness and work­force trans­for­ma­tion, we will con­tinue to el­e­vate HR pro­fes­sion­als into strate­gic busi­ness part­ners and lead­ers. In turn, this also means bet­ter jobs in HR,” he said, not­ing that there are about 47,000 HR pro­fes­sion­als in Sin­ga­pore, of whom 90 per cent are lo­cal.</p>
    <p>Mr Zaqy high­lighted that me­dian wages for HR pro­fes­sion­als have grown by about 10 per cent from 2015, and HRTAP aims to sup­port th­ese work­ers to take on roles with higher value-add and wages through HR trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The panel has also rec­om­mended both tar­geted and broad­based ini­tia­tives to help com­pa­nies build HR ca­pabil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>As part of its tar­geted sup­port, the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) and IHRP are work­ing with agen­cies to de­velop sec­tor-spe­cific HR play­books, with cu­rated tools and so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment will also in­te­grate HR ca­pa­bil­ity-build­ing com­po­nents into its en­ter­prise sup­port schemes, such as the Scale-Up SG pro­gramme, which helps high­growth com­pa­nies, said Mr Zaqy, who was speak­ing on the sec­ond day of the vir­tual HR Tech Fes­ti­val Asia, which ends to­day.</p>
    <p>Broader mea­sures im­ple­mented in­clude pro­vid­ing busi­nesses with greater ac­cess to more af­ford­able HR tech­nol­ogy so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>The MOM will also in­tro­duce an em­ployer data por­tal to al­low com­pa­nies to ac­cess com­pany-spe­cific work­force in­sights in the fourth quar­ter of this year, to help em­ploy­ers in man­power plan­ning and im­prov­ing their hir­ing and em­ploy­ment practices.</p>
    <p>Mr Zaqy high­lighted that the na­tional Hu­man Cap­i­tal Di­ag­nos­tic Tool (HCDT), which iden­ti­fies strengths and gaps in hu­man cap­i­tal pro­cesses as well as ap­pro­pri­ate so­lu­tions, is a use­ful re­source that busi­nesses can tap.</p>
    <p>More than 1,000 firms have used the HCDT to date, said Mr Zaqy, cit­ing lo­cal fur­ni­ture re­tailer Scan­teak, which im­ple­mented a new HR sys­tem and e-learn­ing plat­form for its sales staff af­ter us­ing the tool. The new sys­tems have helped en­hance its work­ers’ dig­i­tal com­pe­ten­cies since, he added.</p>
    <p>The HRTAP aims to have 5,000 HCDT as­sess­ments by 2025, and for 80 per cent of com­pa­nies to have im­proved di­ag­nos­tic scores by the same year, he said.</p>
    <p>In a vir­tual panel dis­cus­sion, sev­eral mem­bers of the HRTAP spoke on how HR will sup­port busi­ness trans­for­ma­tion, and the im­pact of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic on the role of HR pro­fes­sion­als and the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>IHRP chief ex­ec­u­tive Mayank Parekh em­pha­sised the need for HR pro­fes­sion­als to de­velop dig­i­tal acu­men, and utilise an­a­lytics to im­prove per­for­mance and em­ployee ex­pe­ri­ences. “It is crit­i­cal now that HR lead­ers progress from just anec­do­tal ap­proaches to con­vince busi­ness lead­ers to more ev­i­dence­based think­ing and pro­vid­ing more data and de­ci­sion sci­ence be­hind the rec­om­men­da­tions that they are mak­ing,” he said.</p>
