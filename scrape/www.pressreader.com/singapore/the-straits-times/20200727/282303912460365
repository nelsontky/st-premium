    <p>NEW YORK • Le­Bron J ames has seen a great deal dur­ing his 17 sea­sons in the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA). He has al­ready won three cham­pi­onships, and now as­pires to earn his first with the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers (49-14), who lead the Western Con­fer­ence stand­ings.</p>
    <p>At 35, he is one of the old­est play­ers in the league, with patches of grey show­ing in the beard he grew out dur­ing the four months he re­cently spent in rel­a­tive seclu­sion.</p>
    <p>It is not of­ten, then, that he finds him­self in a new en­vi­ron­ment, cop­ing with un­usual cir­cum­stances that no one could have seen com­ing.</p>
    <p>But there he was on Thurs­day night, sta­tioned on the foul line in a largely empty arena at Walt Dis­ney World, bark­ing de­fen­sive as­sign­ments at team­mates as op­er­a­tions crew piped in ar­ti­fi­cial crowd noise.</p>
    <p>James had not played bas­ket­ball for the tele­vi­sion-view­ing public in 135 days, since the NBA sus­pended its sea­son in March be­cause of the coronaviru­s pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But if there were ques­tions about how he would look in his re­turn, as the Lak­ers faced the Dal­las Mavericks in a scrim­mage be­fore the league’s of­fi­cial restart on Thurs­day, he crammed his 15 min­utes of play­ing time full of an­swers.</p>
    <p>In short, “King James” looked ex­actly the same.</p>
    <p>There are so few guar­an­tees as the NBA hopes to fin­ish the sea­son in its so-called bubble at the sprawl­ing theme park near Or­lando, Florida, but James seems de­ter­mined to fill his fa­mil­iar role.</p>
    <p>Against the Mavericks, he col­lected 12 points, five as­sists and three re­bounds. He watched the sec­ond half from the bench, where he put ice packs on parts of his body.</p>
    <p>The Mavericks’ 108-104 vic­tory in a game with 10-minute quar­ters was an af­ter­thought.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to try to get bet­ter,” James said. “We’re us­ing this mo­ment as a train­ing camp to im­ple­ment our iden­tity, and our iden­tity is to de­fend, share the ball, push the tempo and play to­gether. I think we were able to ac­com­plish that for as close to 40 min­utes as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>Scep­tics have sug­gested that this sea­son – in­ter­rupted and un­cer­tain – will come with an as­ter­isk.</p>
    <p>James does not sub­scribe to that the­ory.</p>
    <p>As the win­dow on his ca­reer nar­rows, he wants to seize another crack at a ti­tle. His­tory will not re­mem­ber that he won his fourth ring in a bubble.</p>
    <p>Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo would love to win his first. The Mil­wau­kee Bucks’ do-ev­ery­thing for­ward and the league’s reign­ing Most Valu­able Player de­scribed the for­mat as “the tough­est cham­pi­onship you could ever win, be­cause the cir­cum­stances are re­ally, re­ally tough right now”.</p>
    <p>Play­ers had to stay in shape dur­ing the long lay­off, and even now, teams are short-handed.</p>
    <p>Like the Lak­ers, the Bucks made their Dis­ney de­but on Thurs­day. And in a 113-92 win over the San An­to­nio Spurs, the Bucks were with­out Eric Bled­soe, their start­ing point guard, and Pat Con­naughton, one of their re­serves. Both play­ers re­cently tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>As for An­te­tok­oun­mpo, 25, the odd at­mos­phere be­came ap­par­ent to him when he went to shoot free throws in the first quar­ter.</p>
    <p>“It was just quiet,” he said. “But at the end of the day, you play bas­ket­ball, try to make the right play. So for me per­son­ally, I tried to lock in.”</p>
    <p>The “Greek Freak” also said that he felt out of shape, adding that he</p>
    <p>TEAM BUILD­ING</p>
    <p>We wanted to try to get bet­ter. We’re us­ing this mo­ment as a train­ing camp to im­ple­ment our iden­tity, and our iden­tity is to de­fend, share the ball, push the tempo and play to­gether.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>LE­BRON JAMES, re­flect­ing on the Lak­ers’ modus operandi in Florida.</p>
    <p>hoped to spend the next cou­ple of weeks ratch­et­ing up his fit­ness.</p>
    <p>All he did against the Spurs was score 22 points in 21 min­utes. Imag­ine the havoc once he is fit.</p>
    <p>The Lak­ers are deal­ing with some ab­sences too.</p>
    <p>Avery Bradley, their top perime­ter de­fender, opted out of par­tic­i­pat­ing in the restart, cit­ing fam­ily rea­sons.</p>
    <p>Fel­low guard Ra­jon Rondo is ex­pected to miss sev­eral weeks af­ter frac­tur­ing his right thumb, and Alex Caruso, another back­court player, has a back in­jury.</p>
    <p>James of­ten has the ball in his hands re­gard­less of his sup­port­ing cast, but it is a safe as­sump­tion that he will be his team’s pri­mary fa­cil­i­ta­tor through­out their stay at Dis­ney.</p>
    <p>One scrim­mage is a small sam­ple, but he was the driv­ing force. And it worked out well, per usual.</p>
    <p>“You’ve got to cre­ate your own en­ergy here,” James said.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Le&#xAD;Bron James has emerged as fit as a fid&#xAD;dle in the NBA bubble in Or&#xAD;lando. He will be ex&#xAD;pected to make the Lak&#xAD;ers&#x2019; plays while his back&#xAD;court team&#xAD;mates re&#xAD;cover, as the league&#x2019;s restart nears.</p>
