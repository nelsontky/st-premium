    <p>Aus­tralian singer Kylie Minogue made what she called a “crazy” slice of pop mu­sic his­tory last Friday, be­com­ing the first fe­male artist to have No. 1 al­bums i n Bri­tain across five decades as Disco t opped the charts.</p>
    <p>Mostly recorded at home dur­ing the coro­n­avirus l ock­down, her 15th stu­dio al­bum also notched up the best open­ing week for any Bri­tish re­lease so far this year with 55,000 chart sales, the Of­fi­cial Charts Com­pany said.</p>
    <p>“That sounds crazy to me. I’m 52 years old,” Minogue said of the five-decade record – an ac­co­lade she now shares with rock star Bruce Spring­steen – be­fore it was an­nounced.</p>
    <p>Disco, in which she re­vis­its her dance mu­sic roots, also marks Minogue’s eighth Bri­tish No. 1 al­bum, tak­ing her one ahead of singers Cliff Richard, El­ton John and Ge­orge Michael with seven apiece.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing about the power of pop, Minogue said it can be a marker for peo­ple’s lives.</p>
    <p>“A lot of the best pop songs that seem so sim­ple are the trick­i­est ones to do. There’s no dis­trac­tion. There’s no tricks. It’s just an amaz­ing song,” she said.</p>
    <p>After mak­ing her name in hit soap opera Neigh­bours (1985 to present), Minogue burst onto the mu­sic scene in the late 1980s, work­ing with the song­writ­ing and record-pro­duc­ing trio Stock, Aitken and Water­man.</p>
    <p>Mike Stock, 68, re­called their first meet­ing in 1987.</p>
    <p>“When Kylie first came into the stu­dio, she sat in the cor­ner in the back cro­chet­ing and Matt Aitken and I both thought, ‘Well, God, I hope she’s got some kind of sparkle’... But we got her be­hind the mic... the switch flicked and she was a star,” he said.</p>
    <p>To­gether they made four al­bums, with the first two – Kylie (1988) and En­joy Your­self (1989) – also reach­ing No. 1.</p>
    <p>“The first al­bum we did was one of the best-sell­ing al­bums of the whole decade,” Stock said.</p>
    <p>“I’m ob­vi­ously very proud of that. Proud to have worked with Kylie who has lasted in the business – just to sur­vive is an achieve­ment. But she’s do­ing bril­liant.”</p>
