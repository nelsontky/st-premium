    <p>1 JUSTIN, $400</p>
    <p>He is al­ways blue, just like the colour of his fur. Made in June, this hand pup­pet is cyn­i­cism in­car­nate, see­ing a prob­lem in every so­lu­tion. Although he is highly crit­i­cal of ev­ery­thing around him, his weird way of look­ing at the world strangely makes sense at times.</p>
    <p>2 CAR­MEN, $1,800</p>
    <p>This skilled cabaret per­former is sexy and she knows it. In­spired by the late Brazil­ian samba singer-ac­tress Car­men Mi­randa, this danc­ing mar­i­onette can tan­ta­lise her au­di­ence, swish­ing her skirt and do­ing splits and high kicks. With her big, blink­ing eyes, the flir­ta­tious char­ac­ter has been a reg­u­lar at Mr Yeo’s shows since 2000.</p>
    <p>3 MELODY, $400</p>
    <p>A vet­eran at Mr Yeo’s shows, this gullible hand pup­pet is al­ways mak­ing friends. Dressed in Mid­dle East­ern-style garb, she sings a song ti­tled The Camel’s Nose, about a camel seek­ing warmth in her tent on a frosty desert night. She lets the camel in, but, bit by bit, finds her­self pushed out of her tent and into the cold. So much for be­ing kind.</p>
    <p>4 FACECHANGI­NG PUP­PET, $2,300</p>
    <p>In­spired by the mag­i­cal sub-genre of face-chang­ing in Chi­nese opera, this mys­te­ri­ous char­ac­ter can whip out seven colour­ful faces in one per­for­mance. His elab­o­rate out­fit fea­tures real pheas­ant feath­ers and he is held up by high-ten­sion fish­ing lines. Cre­ated in 2017, he has not made his de­but, although the user will have to master his face-chang­ing se­crets be­fore tak­ing the stage.</p>
    <p>5 BUNNY PUP­PET, $400</p>
    <p>A ma­gi­cian pulls a bunny out of a hat, but why can’t it be the other way around? So asks this cu­ri­ous, ques­tion­ing rab­bit pup­pet, which has no name. Made in June from foam and vel­vet, it is con­trolled by a hand at the back of its neck. Its pos­able ears al­low it a wide range of emo­tions – from shy­ness to timid­ity to wide-eyed ex­cite­ment.</p>
