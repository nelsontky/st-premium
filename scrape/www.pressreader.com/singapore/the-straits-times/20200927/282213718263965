    <p>Mr Al­bert See, 81, loves flights to nowhere.</p>
    <p>Th­ese no-des­ti­na­tion jaunts are now cap­tur­ing the imag­i­na­tion, but the tour agency vet­eran was a pro­po­nent long be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He char­tered new Jumbo jets from Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) and the su­per­sonic Con­corde from Bri­tish Air­ways for high-al­ti­tude joyrides four decades ago for his clients.</p>
    <p>He has also flown round-trip on a Qan­tas plane from Australia to Antarc­tica, hov­er­ing low over the white con­ti­nent.</p>
    <p>And his de­light in th­ese air ad­ven­tures sparked a busi­ness pro­posal. Last month, Mr See, who is man­ag­ing direc­tor and chief ex­ec­u­tive of ASA Hol­i­days, sent SIA his plan for “fly­ca­tions” that com­bine air, sea and land ex­pe­ri­ences. He is await­ing a re­sponse.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times re­ported re­cently that the car­rier is plan­ning to l aunch a flights-to-nowhere cam­paign.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries, Sin­ga­pore Air­lines said sev­eral ini­tia­tives are be­ing con­sid­ered, adding: “We will make an an­nounce­ment at the ap­pro­pri­ate time if we go ahead with th­ese plans.”</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Sun­day Times, Mr See – who will mark his sixth decade i n travel next year – re­counts his flights to nowhere and looks ahead to post-pan­demic glo­be­trot­ting.</p>
    <p>Back in 1980, he char­tered new Boe­ing 747 jumbo jets from SIA for sev­eral one-hour flights around the is­land, with teatime treats served by stew­ardesses. Cer­tifi­cates signed by the cap­tain were pre­sented to each group of 300-plus pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>“The flights were full. Many peo­ple had never taken a plane in those days,” he says.</p>
    <p>He priced econ­omy seats at $69. Busi­ness- and first-class fares were around $200 and $300. To pub­li­cise the no-pass­port flights, he booked huge ad­ver­tise­ments, in­clud­ing in The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines is in a very messy sit­u­a­tion. It needs busi­ness. Oth­er­wise, its air­craft are stay­ing in the desert and its pi­lots are not fly­ing... It’s a new way of travel. Have you flown to nowhere? Why not try one time?</p>
    <p>The fol­low­ing year, when the na­tional car­rier was re­lo­cat­ing its planes from Paya Le­bar Air­port to the new Changi Air­port, he char­tered a smaller Boe­ing 727 High Tail air­craft for another spin in the sky.</p>
    <p>Econ­omy tick­ets cost less than $100 for the one-hour ride over the South China Sea, again with teatime treats and a cer­tifi­cate. The nar­row-body air­liner had a ca­pac­ity of about 100.</p>
    <p>“This was the one and only do­mes­tic flight in Sin­ga­pore,” he quips.</p>
    <p>In a trip he calls “his­toric”, the plane took off and landed in two dif­fer­ent air­ports in the Repub­lic.</p>
    <p>In 1981, too, Mr See char­tered a Con­corde that flew at twice the speed of sound over the At­lantic. The twohour flight from Lon­don’s Heathrow Air­port capped a tour of Europe for a hun­dred clients from Sin­ga­pore and other parts of South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>He says: “The Con­corde cruised at Mach 2 at an al­ti­tude of more than 50,000 feet. All the pas­sen­gers en­joyed the blue sky with good food and the hos­pi­tal­ity of the cap­tain and hostesses on board.”</p>
    <p>Again, his clients had the op­por­tu­nity to ex­pe­ri­ence a slice of his­tory be­fore the rev­o­lu­tion­ary Con­corde was de­com­mis­sioned in 2003 due to pro­hib­i­tive ex­penses.</p>
    <p>Mr See’s idea for char­ter flights to nowhere orig­i­nated in his dreamy 13-hour round trip from Syd­ney to Antarc­tica in 1979, on board a Qan­tas 747 air­craft. The Antarc­tica char­ter still op­er­ates, though there was a hiatus for some years.</p>
    <p>He de­scribes it as “the world’s long­est flight to nowhere”. Look­ing back, he says: “Ev­ery­one had a fan­tas­tic time and a great bird’s-eye view of the con­ti­nent.”</p>
    <p>Last year, he sent a group of clients on the Qan­tas char­ter flight. They flew from Mel­bourne to Antarc­tica af­ter eight days of sight­see­ing.</p>
    <p>With th­ese joy-flights in mind, he wrote to SIA last month, re­quest­ing to char­ter the dou­ble-decker Air­bus 380 “be­fore it be­comes his­tory” be­cause of high op­er­at­ing costs.</p>
    <p>He wants to host 300 pas­sen­gers on the A380, rather than fill it to its 400-plus ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>This will be 75 per cent of the pas­sen­ger load fac­tor for safety and se­cu­rity, he says.</p>
    <p>Al­ter­na­tively, another wide-body air­craft will suf­fice for his pro­posed flight of 60 to 70 min­utes.</p>
    <p>The dif­fer­ence this time is that he wants to pack­age the flight with mix-and-match el­e­ments, such as is­land-hop­ping in style on a mini­cruise, lux­ury-coach lo­cal ex­cur­sions, stay­ca­tions, gourmet din­ing and shop­ping deals at Jewel Changi Air­port and else­where.</p>
    <p>Mr See reck­ons that the price for a one-day pack­age with air, sea and land com­po­nents can start at $268. The price will vary ac­cord­ing to the du­ra­tion of the “Air-Sea-Land Cir­cle” pack­age or the level of lux­ury. There may be four cabin cat­e­gories in a plane, for in­stance, while a week in a five-star ho­tel will be a big­ger splurge than a ba­sic stay.</p>
    <p>He hopes to start the char­ter from De­cem­ber, if the air­line is re­cep­tive.</p>
    <p>Mind­ful that crit­ics are warn­ing about the en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact or fad­dish­ness of flights to nowhere, Mr See has a cou­ple of re­sponses.</p>
    <p>For one thing, he thinks the sur­vival of SIA may out­weigh con­cerns about car­bon emis­sions.</p>
    <p>“SIA is in a very messy sit­u­a­tion. It needs busi­ness. Oth­er­wise, its air­craft are stay­ing in the desert and its pi­lots are not fly­ing,” he says.</p>
    <p>More­over, the flights would be one facet of a big­ger va­ca­tion plan with cruises and land ac­tiv­i­ties, he adds.</p>
    <p>“It’s a new way of travel. Have you flown to nowhere? Why not try one time? I want Sin­ga­pore­ans to en­joy them­selves,” says Mr See, who also played a role in found­ing tour agen­cies SA Tours and CTC Travel.</p>
    <p>With leisure travel still al­most im­pos­si­ble – un­like Sars in 2003, when he could still fly to Europe and North Amer­ica – he fig­ures that stay-home hol­i­days have an ap­peal for Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>It is also a life­line for the in­dus­try un­til travel to the re­gion re­sumes, which he an­tic­i­pates will be next year.</p>
    <p>“The Gov­ern­ment has re­serve funds, but we do not. We have had zero rev­enue since March. So, we cre­ate a new thing,” he says, adding</p>
    <p>MR AL­BERT SEE, who is mind­ful of crit­ics warn­ing about the en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact of flights to nowhere, but thinks the sur­vival of Sin­ga­pore’s flag­ship car­rier may out­weigh con­cerns about car­bon emis­sions</p>
    <p>that he can sell his pack­ages to other tour op­er­a­tors so the pie is shared.</p>
    <p>He says he has spent so many years in the busi­ness, weath­er­ing crises and savour­ing suc­cess, that he is on even keel now.</p>
    <p>In the glory days of the 1980s, he had of­fices in San Fran­cisco, Lon­don, Paris, Syd­ney, Seoul, all over Malaysia and else­where.</p>
    <p>ASA Hol­i­days, a fam­ily busi­ness, or­gan­ised large-scale travel fairs and gave away grand prizes such as Mercedes-Benz lux­ury sa­loons.</p>
    <p>It de­vel­oped China as a de­sir­able des­ti­na­tion for clients, with ban­quets held at the Great Hall of the Peo­ple in Bei­jing for 1,500 din­ers, and de­signed a Bill Clin­ton-themed tour that fol­lowed in the foot­steps of the for­mer United States pres­i­dent, who vis­ited China in 1998.</p>
    <p>Mr See’s dream then – and now with his flights to nowhere – was to make travel “avail­able to all”.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic is painful, but not in­sur­mount­able, he says. “I am not so de­pressed. The only thing is to find a way to go through the pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>He hopes the pan­demic will ease at the be­gin­ning of next year. He will then re­ju­ve­nate his plans, which in­clude trips to pretty vil­lages in Asia, funny TikTok el­e­ments on the book­ing site and, cer­tainly, char­ters.</p>
    <p>Mr See is now think­ing of send­ing a trade mis­sion to the new Bei­jing Dax­ing In­ter­na­tional Air­port – the world’s big­gest – which opened in Septem­ber last year. Antarc­tica, which started him dream­ing up char­ter flights, still beck­ons as well.</p>
    <p>Next year, he wants to send a party on a Qan­tas Boe­ing 787 Dream­liner jour­ney that strad­dles the last day of 2021 and the first day of 2022. “So you spend ‘two years’ in the air, with cock­tails and mu­sic on board.”</p>
    <p>The high-spir­ited bach­e­lor, who has cir­cum­nav­i­gated the globe by air and camped in the Cam­bo­dian jun­gle, can­not wait to travel again.</p>
    <p>And then he will con­tinue mak­ing friends across bor­ders and gen­er­a­tions in nat­u­ral havens and cities ev­ery­where.</p>
