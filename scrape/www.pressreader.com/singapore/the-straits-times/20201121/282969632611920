    <p>Will 200hp be enough to move a car like the Land Rover Dis­cov­ery Sport? Yes, but just barely.</p>
    <p>Even though the Dis­cov­ery Sport is a com­pact sport util­ity ve­hi­cle, it weighs nearly two tonnes. And if all its seven seats are oc­cu­pied, the 200 ponies will be heav­ing 2.5 tonnes from junc­tion to junc­tion.</p>
    <p>The car’s 2-litre tur­bocharged in­line-4 is the same as the pre­vi­ous 240hp engine. It has been de­tuned to pro­duce 200hp for bet­ter ef­fi­ciency and emis­sion.</p>
    <p>Alas, nei­ther ob­jec­tive seems to have been achieved. The car’s band­ing un­der the Ve­hic­u­lar Emis­sions Scheme re­mains un­changed at C1 (sur­charge of $10,000). And for this test-drive, done largely on high­ways, the car av­er­aged 18 litres/100km – more than dou­ble its de­clared 7.7 litres.</p>
    <p>This is sur­pris­ing, since the car is fit­ted with a “mild hy­brid” sys­tem which helps save fuel by giv­ing the engine a boost when start­ing off, and fa­cil­i­tat­ing engine-off coast­ing. The lat­ter hap­pens only at speeds below 17kmh, which means over the last sev­eral me­tres be­fore the car comes to a stop.</p>
    <p>On the whole, the Land Rover, be­ing a tra­di­tional 4x4, does not coast ex­ceed­ingly well. You feel the ef­fects of engine brak­ing as soon as you lift your foot off the pedal.</p>
    <p>The changes have done noth­ing for its drive­abil­ity. The Dis­cov­ery</p>
    <p>Sport re­quires a heavy right foot to get go­ing. Even at a trot, it of­ten re­quires gen­er­ous prod­ding to get up to a gal­lop.</p>
    <p>Its stated 9.2-sec­ond cen­tury sprint seems op­ti­mistic. Even for ev­ery­day chores, it is not un­com­mon to hear the engine spin­ning above 3,500rpm.</p>
    <p>Thank­fully, steer­ing-mounted cruise con­trol but­tons al­low you to</p>
    <p>drive the car with just your thumb. But even here, the de­cel­er­ate but­ton does not al­ways work.</p>
    <p>Dreary driv­ing aside, the Dis­cov­ery Sport is as like­able as be­fore. It is size­able, but not enor­mous like the Dis­cov­ery. So it is more ag­ile and less un­wieldy in our city.</p>
    <p>The park­ing cam­era on its lat­est in­fo­tain­ment screen helps. And if that is not enough, there is a dig­i­tal mir­ror (linked to a cam­era on the car’s shark-fin an­tenna) which gives a wide-an­gle rear view for safer rev­ers­ing.</p>
    <p>The costlier R-Dy­namic SE vari­ant has ClearSight Ground View, which projects a graphic rep­re­sen­ta­tion of where the wheels are in re­la­tion to kerbs and other ob­jects. Use­ful in trick­ier carparks, or nar­row bridges in the woods (if you are among the 1 per cent of own­ers who go off-road).</p>
    <p>The in­te­rior has am­ple space for five, with col­lapsi­ble emer­gency seats for two more in the third row. They are easy to fold and de­ploy, un­der­scor­ing Land Rover’s main propo­si­tion – ver­sa­til­ity and util­ity.</p>
    <p>There are rub­ber mats with raised sides, too. So, pick­ing up the kids af­ter soc­cer prac­tice or a day out at the beach will not lead to a clean-up cri­sis af­ter­wards.</p>
    <p>The car comes with a wire­less phone-charg­ing pad, USB ports, 4G Wi-Fi hot spot and 12-volt sock­ets.</p>
    <p>So, if you are a leisurely driver with a grow­ing, ac­tive fam­ily, the de­tuned Dis­cov­ery Sport is still a rather at­trac­tive choice.</p>
    <p>The car is now slightly sharper look­ing too, with a new grille which is more an­gled, restyled LED head­lamps and bolder tail­lights.</p>
