    <p>Three-time Olympic medal­list Feng Tian­wei ad­mit­ted her re­lief at re­turn­ing to win­ning ways yes­ter­day af­ter two con­sec­u­tive open­ing de­feats in two weeks.</p>
    <p>The world No. 9 put up a strong per­for­mance to com­fort­ably beat Amer­i­can world No. 27 Lily Zhang 3-0 (11-5, 11-4, 11-6) and ad­vance to the quar­ter-fi­nals at the pro­mo­tional World Ta­ble Ten­nis (WTT) Ma­cau show­case.</p>
    <p>Feng told The Straits Times: “It’s true that to­day’s match gave me some con­fi­dence. Af­ter all, my last two events were a blow to me.</p>
    <p>“It’s been a tough last month but I still man­aged to over­come the big­gest hur­dle through hard work and that marks a new begin­ning for my Olympic prepa­ra­tions. An­other bad re­sult would have meant be­ing stuck i n the rut longer.”</p>
    <p>Her vic­tory comes af­ter de­feats by Zhang at the In­ter­na­tional Ta­ble Ten­nis Fed­er­a­tion (ITTF) Women’s World Cup in Wei­hai on</p>
    <p>Nov 9 and Ger­man world No. 20 Petrissa Solja at the ITTF Fi­nals last week.</p>
    <p>Feng, 34, has a sil­ver and two bronze Olympic medals and is seek­ing to add to her col­lec­tion at next year’s Tokyo Games, which will be her fourth ap­pear­ance at the Olympics.</p>
    <p>Coach He Keyi, 35, was pleased with Feng’s per­for­mance and said the win will give her a platform to build on.</p>
    <p>“Her over­all per­for­mance to­day was up to stan­dard. Af­ter her loss in the World Cup, we made some tac­ti­cal changes to bet­ter tar­get her op­po­nent’s weak­ness.</p>
    <p>“She ex­e­cuted that well so the match was rather smooth to­day. We also ad­justed her men­tal­ity to help her get back into the rhythm of com­pet­ing.</p>
    <p>“In fu­ture games, we will go with the flow, make changes and learn along the way.”</p>
    <p>Held at the Tap Seac Multisport Pavil­ion, WTT Ma­cau started on Wed­nes­day and will end on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The tour­na­ment fea­tures 32 global stars in­clud­ing reign­ing</p>
    <p>Olympic men’s and women’s cham­pi­ons Ma Long and Ding Ning, and top seed Chen Meng, who won the Women’s World Cup and ITTF Fi­nals ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>It has a prize purse of US$800,000 (S$1.07 mil­lion) that in­cludes a US$15,000 ap­pear­ance fee for each pad­dler.</p>
    <p>Feng will face world No. 1 Chen of China in to­day’s quar­ter-fi­nal.</p>
    <p>“For to­mor­row’s match, I’m pre­par­ing for it with a learn­ing at­ti­tude and hope I’ll be able to do my best,” said Feng, who ad­justed her men­tal­ity to take a 2-1 lead in her head-to-head meet­ings with Zhang.</p>
    <p>“I’m not think­ing about win­ning or los­ing, the most im­por­tant thing to me now is still to get my match con­di­tion to its best.</p>
    <p>“This will help me iden­tify and solve prob­lems more eas­ily dur­ing a game.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter WTT Ma­cau 2020, Feng will head to Ja­pan, where she will rep­re­sent Osaka-based Ja­pan Paint Maretz in the T.League.</p>
