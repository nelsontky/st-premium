    <p>Since sta­tis­tics have been pub­lished pe­ri­od­i­cally to con­vince the pub­lic that the trains are more re­li­able, it was both sur­pris­ing and sad­den­ing to learn that the re­cent train dis­rup­tion was the worst of its kind to hit the MRT net­work since 2017 (Bid to fix fault led to dis­rup­tion of 3 MRT lines, Oct 16).</p>
    <p>SMRT re­vealed that the in­ci­dent started with the break­down of the in­su­la­tion of a power ca­ble in Tuas on the East-West Line. As the cir­cuit breaker did not work, the power sys­tem of other train lines tripped. This brings into ques­tion the ef­fec­tive­ness of the main­te­nance works done reg­u­larly through early MRT line clo­sures and late open­ings.</p>
    <p>With the avoid­able con­cur­rent fail­ure of three train lines tak­ing place when many peo­ple are still work­ing from home, SMRT must take the op­por­tu­nity to put in place sys­tem pro­to­cols to pre­pare for the full re­open­ing of the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic trans­port op­er­a­tor must also take good care of its em­ploy­ees so that these nec­es­sary pro­to­cols can be car­ried out safely and ef­fi­ciently in a sup­port­ive work­ing cul­ture.</p>
    <p>It is the na­tional ex­am­i­na­tion sea­son for stu­dents now, and par­ents should not have to bear the added worry of an un­re­li­able train net­work af­fect­ing their chil­dren. The crowded bus stops, closed MRT sta­tions and long hours of de­lay can be very up­set­ting.</p>
    <p>Cit­i­zens have con­fi­dence that our newly ap­pointed Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung will not be com­pla­cent and will en­sure that such dis­ap­point­ing ma­jor trans­port dis­rup­tions will not hap­pen again.</p>
    <p>Many would agree that this one in­ci­dent is one too many. We must all con­tin­u­ally work to­gether for Sin­ga­pore to come back stronger in the post-pan­demic econ­omy.</p>
