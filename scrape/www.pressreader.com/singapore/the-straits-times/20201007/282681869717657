    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Bri­tish rock­ers Led Zep­pelin have won a long-run­ning le­gal dis­pute over the band’s clas­sic song, Stair­way To Heaven, af­ter the United States Supreme Court on Mon­day re­fused to take up a copyright claim over the case.</p>
    <p>A lower court in Cal­i­for­nia last March had ruled that Led Zep­pelin had not swiped the song’s open­ing riff from Taurus, which was writ­ten by the late Randy Wolfe of a Los An­ge­les band called Spirit.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion on Mon­day by the coun­try’s high­est court not to hear the case defini­tively ends the le­gal chal­lenges which had been closely watched by the mu­sic in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Led Zep­pelin had ini­tially won the case in 2016, with the court at the time find­ing no proof that the 1971 clas­sic breached the copyright of Taurus. How­ever, that rul­ing was over­turned on ap­peal in 2018.</p>
    <p>Led Zep­pelin gui­tarist Jimmy Page – who was sued along with the group’s singer Robert Plant and an­other sur­viv­ing band­mate John Paul Jones – tes­ti­fied in 2016 that the chord se­quence in ques­tion had “been around for­ever”.</p>
    <p>Wolfe’s trustee, Mr Michael Skidmore, filed the case in 2014 on be­half of his friend, who long main­tained he de­served credit for Stair­way, but Wolfe drowned in 1997, hav­ing never taken le­gal ac­tion over the song.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts called by the plain­tiffs at the lower court trial said there were sub­stan­tial sim­i­lar­i­ties be­tween key parts of the two songs.</p>
    <p>How­ever, de­fence wit­nesses tes­ti­fied that the chord pat­tern used in the melan­cholic gui­tar in­tro to Stair­way was so com­mon­place that copyright did not ap­ply.</p>
