    <p>•</p>
    <p>The cri­sis-hit In­ter­na­tional Weightlift­ing Fed­er­a­tion (IWF), fight­ing to keep its place at the 2024 Paris Olympics, last Fri­day named a third president in a trou­bled week.</p>
    <p>It had ap­pointed Michael Irani, the Bri­tish chair of the fed­er­a­tion’s med­i­cal com­mit­tee and a former chair of its anti-dop­ing commission, as its in­terim president.</p>
    <p>While Irani ac­cepted the nom­i­na­tion, he in­sisted he was not in­ter­ested do­ing the job full time, but was com­mit­ted to fur­ther­ing re­forms around the is­sue of drug test­ing that has plagued the sport.</p>
    <p>“I am grate­ful to the IWF ex­ec­u­tive board for en­trust­ing me with the pres­i­dency on an in­terim ba­sis,” he said. “I do not in­tend to stand as a can­di­date for the IWF president po­si­tion in the fu­ture, so I will be able to focus fully on the re­forms lead­ing up to a clear and trans­par­ent IWF Congress (In March next year).”</p>
    <p>The Bu­da­pest-based IWF had re­moved its in­terim president, Amer­i­can Ur­sula Garza Pa­pan­drea, af­ter an ex­ec­u­tive board vote at an emer­gency meet­ing last Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee (IOC) said the next day that it was “very wor­ried” about the board­room putsch, say­ing they had “en­joyed ex­cel­lent co­op­er­a­tion” with Pa­pan­drea.</p>
    <p>The IOC did not name her re­place­ment but the chief ex­ec­u­tive of USA Weightlift­ing Phil An­drews an­nounced in a state­ment that Thai­land’s In­tarat Yod­bang­toey had taken over the post.</p>
    <p>The Olympic body has threat­ened last week to “re­con­sider the place of weightlift­ing on the pro­gramme of the Olympic Games in Paris 2024”.</p>
    <p>It will make a fi­nal de­ci­sion on the events and quo­tas of ath­letes for the Games by De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>Weightlift­ing has been in tur­moil since Jan­uary when a doc­u­men­tary by Ger­man TV chan­nel ARD re­vealed what it de­scribed as a “cul­ture of cor­rup­tion” in the sport in­tended to mask the use of dop­ing.</p>
    <p>Hun­gar­ian Ta­mas Ajan, 81, president of the IWF for 20 years af­ter serv­ing as its sec­re­tary-gen­eral for 24, re­jected the ac­cu­sa­tions as “lies” be­fore be­ing pres­sured into re­sign­ing in April.</p>
