    <p>TREAT­MENT DE­LAYED</p>
    <p>Mr Ab­dul Rashid Sa­hari and his wife Safiah Rawi Abed had planned to fly home to Sin­ga­pore this month from Jakarta, where Mr Rashid works, to cel­e­brate their 33rd wed­ding an­niver­sary with their daugh­ters and grand­chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Never did they ex­pect to make the jour­ney back sep­a­rately – and by air am­bu­lance.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple con­tracted Covid-19, with Mr Rashid, 64, be­com­ing se­verely ill. Both were evac­u­ated to Sin­ga­pore on Dec 7 and Dec 8 for ur­gent med­i­cal treat­ment.</p>
    <p>While Madam Safiah, 56, has re­cov­ered, Mr Rashid is still in in­ten­sive care at the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to queries from The Straits Times, the Min­istry of</p>
    <p>Health (MOH) said that while the cou­ple were treated in Sin­ga­pore, they are not counted in the of­fi­cial Covid-19 num­bers as they had tested pos­i­tive over­seas. This is in line with World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion guide­lines that coun­tries should count only cases in their ju­ris­dic­tions so as to avoid dou­ble count­ing, said MOH.</p>
    <p>Mr Rashid’s symp­toms be­gan with a fever and cough. His con­di­tion de­te­ri­o­rated quickly, to the point where In­done­sian doc­tors rec­om­mended in­tu­ba­tion to help him breathe.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple’s son-in-law Haikel Fahim, 34, told ST: “De­spite him feel­ing re­ally sick, he was not ad­mit­ted to hospi­tal when he went to the clinic in Jakarta on Dec 1.”</p>
    <p>Mr Rashid, who has a his­tory of high blood pres­sure, has been work­ing in In­done­sia for more than 20 years. Cur­rently, he is a qual­ity con­trol of­fi­cer at a power plant in Jakarta.</p>
    <p>Madam Safiah, a per­ma­nent res­i­dent orig­i­nally from In­done­sia, lives in Sin­ga­pore. She and her fam­ily vis­ited her hus­band in Fe­bru­ary, and she de­cided to stay on with him in Jakarta.</p>
    <p>Mr Rashid was even­tu­ally ad­mit­ted to a pri­vate hospi­tal in Jakarta on Dec 3, a week af­ter he tested pos­i­tive for the virus on Nov 27.</p>
    <p>“It was re­ally stress­ful the first day my fa­ther-in-law was warded, be­cause we couldn’t get through to the hospi­tal... or speak to the doc­tor in charge,” said Mr Haikel, who works in pub­lic re­la­tions. “We were also wor­ried about my mother-in-law, who was Covid-19 pos­i­tive and alone at home.”</p>
    <p>As Mr Rashid’s con­di­tion wors­ened, the fam­ily had to make the snap de­ci­sion to bring him home.</p>
    <p>“We made an ur­gent ap­peal on so­cial me­dia, ask­ing if any­one knew how we could get him back, be­cause a com­mer­cial flight couldn’t take him... by that point, he was al­ready on oxy­gen,” Mr Haikel said.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily even­tu­ally f ound Hope Am­bu­lance, which was able to trans­port the cou­ple us­ing a pri­vate jet retro­fit­ted with the ap­pro­pri­ate med­i­cal equip­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Rashid was flown back on Dec 7, the day he was meant to fly back for his an­niver­sary. Madam Safiah re­turned the next day, also in an air am­bu­lance.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily es­ti­mate that the cost of the evac­u­a­tion and sub­se­quent treat­ment would come to $85,000, with the air am­bu­lance flights alone cost­ing $67,000.</p>
    <p>On a blog put up by Mr Haikel de­tail­ing the cou­ple’s ex­pe­ri­ences, the fam­ily made an ap­peal for funds to help cover the costs of the med­i­cal evac­u­a­tion and what they have been told will be a l ong process of re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion for Mr Rashid. He will need a lot of phys­io­ther­apy, said Mr Haikel.</p>
    <p>Since the blog went up on Dec 13, the fam­ily has raised more than $88,000. They said any ex­cess monies will be do­nated to char­ity.</p>
    <p>De­spite him feel­ing re­ally sick, he was not ad­mit­ted to hospi­tal when he went to the clinic in Jakarta on Dec 1.</p>
    <p>MR HAIKEL FAHIM, son-in-law of Mr Ab­dul Rashid Sa­hari.</p>
