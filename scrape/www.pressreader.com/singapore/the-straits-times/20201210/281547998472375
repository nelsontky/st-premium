    <p>Be­fore na­tional health in­sur­ance costs spi­ral out of con­trol, ac­tion should be taken on is­sues such as high man­age­ment and dis­tri­bu­tion pay­ments and the dif­fi­culty of chang­ing in­sur­ers. Oth­er­wise, health­care may no longer be af­ford­able for many, says se­nior health cor­re­spon­dent Salma Kha­lik.</p>
    <p>The health in­sur­ance scene in Sin­ga­pore needs ma­jor tweaks to en­sure costs do not spi­ral out of con­trol – the way they have in coun­tries like the United States.</p>
    <p>Oth­er­wise, health­care may no longer be af­ford­able for many.</p>
    <p>Some rea­sons for the rise in costs must be ac­cepted, even em­braced. For ex­am­ple, bet­ter ser­vices are be­ing pro­vided to keep peo­ple healthy for longer.</p>
    <p>These could be in the form of health screen­ings, vac­ci­na­tions, bet­ter drugs and pro­ce­dures as well as treat­ments such as knee re­place­ment surgery to al­le­vi­ate pain and in­crease mo­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Such spend­ing im­proves the qual­ity of life and prob­a­bly ac­counts for Sin­ga­pore­ans liv­ing the long­est num­ber of healthy years in the world.</p>
    <p>One must also ac­cept that as the pop­u­la­tion ages, costs will rise, as older peo­ple tend to suf­fer more health prob­lems and thus need more care than healthy young adults.</p>
    <p>But there are other fac­tors driv­ing up costs that need to be curbed in the early stages, be­fore they be­come en­trenched.</p>
    <p>RID­ERS DRIV­ING SOAR­ING COSTS</p>
    <p>Stud­ies have shown that when peo­ple pay noth­ing for their treat­ment, they tend to con­sume more, re­gard­less of whether they need it or whether it is good for them.</p>
    <p>That is why the Gov­ern­ment has al­ways in­sisted on pa­tients pay­ing part of the bill for the na­tional health in­sur­ance, MediShield Life.</p>
    <p>Be­cause they need to pay, pa­tients, as well as their doc­tors, are more care­ful about adding on treat­ments and pro­ce­dures that may not be re­quired.</p>
    <p>When pri­vate in­sur­ance com­pa­nies that of­fer in­te­grated plans (IPs) – as add-ons to MediShield Life for non-sub­sidised treat­ments – started of­fer­ing rid­ers that paid ev­ery cent of a pa­tient’s hospi­tal bill, claims shot up.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Life In­sur­ance As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (LIA), of the 2.94 mil­lion peo­ple here who are cov­ered by IPs, 1.75 mil­lion are cov­ered for pri­vate hospi­tal care. About half of the peo­ple with pri­vate hospi­tal IPs also have rid­ers.</p>
    <p>Given those num­bers, soar­ing IP pre­mi­ums are of na­tional con­cern.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing ap­peals from in­sur­ers who had suf­fered years of un­der­writ­ing losses, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) an­nounced in March 2018 that it would no longer al­low peo­ple to buy rid­ers that leave pa­tients with noth­ing to pay of their med­i­cal bills.</p>
    <p>In­stead, any­one buy­ing a new rider will need to pay at least 5 per cent of the hospi­tal bill, capped at $3,000 a year, sub­ject to cer­tain con­di­tions such as ob­tain­ing prior ap­proval from the in­sur­ance com­pany for the pro­ce­dure. Oth­er­wise, the $3,000 cap does not ap­ply.</p>
    <p>How­ever, this new rul­ing does not ap­ply to the 1.1 mil­lion peo­ple who al­ready have rid­ers. Sev­eral in­sur­ers have said they plan to of­fer cheaper pre­mi­ums for this group if they are will­ing to move to a co-pay rider scheme.</p>
    <p>To soften the blow, the new mea­sures will be­come ef­fec­tive only from April 1 next year, for those who have bought new rid­ers since the an­nounce­ment.</p>
    <p>The move is aimed at bring­ing down in­sur­ance claims. But on its own, it may not be enough to check soar­ing health­care costs.</p>
    <p>About six in 10 IPs are for pri­vate hospi­tal care – where in­creases out­pace those in the rest of the in­dus­try. This has pulled up the cost of health­care for ev­ery­one, since the ba­sic MediShield Life pays part of these pri­vate bills.</p>
    <p>The LIA told The Straits Times: “Claims data from IP in­sur­ers in­di­cates that about 20 to 30 per cent of pri­vate sec­tor cases with a sur­gi­cal pro­ce­dure have a sur­geon fee above the up­per bound of the MOH fee bench­mark range, and these cases ac­count for 40 to 50 per cent of to­tal sur­geon fee paid.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Depart­ment of Sta­tis­tics Sin­ga­pore, Western clin­ics en­joyed a prof­itabil­ity ra­tio of 23.7 per cent in 2018 from receipts to­talling $4.6 bil­lion, against just 6.1 per cent profit made by hos­pi­tals. The ma­jor­ity of sur­geons in pri­vate prac­tice op­er­ate out of clin­ics.</p>
    <p>Be­cause all IPs in­cor­po­rate MediShield Life, part of the pre­mi­ums they col­lect is passed on to the na­tional scheme. Sim­i­larly, MediShield Life pays part of the claims made.</p>
    <p>For Sin­ga­pore­ans, this ranges from full pay­ment of al­low­able claims in sub­sidised wards, to 43 per cent in a Class B1 ward, to 35 per cent for Class A and pri­vate hospi­tal bills. For those with IPs, the pri­vate in­surer will pay the rest.</p>
    <p>The MediShield Life Coun­cil has re­cently sug­gested drop­ping the pro­por­tion of pri­vate hospi­tal bills that MediShield Life pays from 35 per cent to 25 per cent, but that would still work out to be higher than most sub­sidised bills.</p>
    <p>The MOH said the av­er­age bill for a heart an­giogram to check for blocked ar­ter­ies is $2,470 in a more ex­pen­sive B2 sub­sidised ward, and $10,314 in a pri­vate hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, MediShield Life pays 35 per cent of the pri­vate hospi­tal bill, which comes to $3,610. If the pro-ra­tion drops to 25 per cent, MediShield Life will pay only $2,579.</p>
    <p>Even then, it is higher than the sub­sidised bill, so peo­ple who do not have a pri­vate hospi­tal IP are sub­si­dis­ing the higher bills of those who have one. The dif­fer­ence would worsen if pri­vate hospi­tal bills con­tinue to out­pace pub­lic sec­tor bills.</p>
    <p>While it might ap­pear more sen­si­ble to put a dol­lar limit on pay­ment of pri­vate hospi­tal bills based on sub­sidised costs, there are so many pos­si­ble treat­ment com­bi­na­tions that it is not a prac­ti­cal so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>HIGH COSTS AND COM­MIS­SIONS</p>
    <p>An­other area of pos­si­ble con­cern is the high man­age­ment costs – and com­mis­sions given to agents – in­curred by some in­sur­ers.</p>
    <p>Of course, man­ag­ing an in­sur­ance scheme has costs. And no one ex­pects a pri­vate in­sur­ance com­pany to do it free.</p>
    <p>It is the quan­tum that is wor­ry­ing.</p>
    <p>Let’s look at just the five IP in­sur­ers who have been in the mar­ket for a long time – since ini­tial costs are usu­ally far higher for new en­trants.</p>
    <p>About 4.6 per cent to 13 per cent of the pre­mi­ums col­lected was used to pay for man­age­ment costs last year, based on the re­turns sub­mit­ted to the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) for health in­sur­ance – the vast bulk of it be­ing IPs and their rid­ers.</p>
    <p>Dis­tri­bu­tion costs, which largely com­prise com­mis­sions to agents, ranged from 6.9 per cent to 20.2 per cent among these five in­sur­ers.</p>
    <p>The higher amounts may be due to some in­sur­ers hav­ing fewer pol­i­cy­hold­ers and thus not en­joy­ing economies of scale; to in­ef­fi­ciency; or to of­fer­ing high com­mis­sions in a bid to gar­ner a larger mar­ket share.</p>
    <p>What­ever the rea­son, it is the pol­i­cy­hold­ers who pay.</p>
    <p>Across the seven IP in­sur­ers, al­most $1 out of ev­ery $4 col­lected in pre­mi­ums does not go to­wards pay­ment of med­i­cal bills.</p>
    <p>This ap­pears ex­ces­sive, es­pe­cially since most of the pre­mi­ums are paid with Medis­ave money.</p>
    <p>Per­haps the MAS should look at cap­ping the amount in­sur­ers can claim for man­age­ment and dis­tri­bu­tion costs.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies that are un­able to keep within those lim­its may want to con­sider leav­ing IP cov­er­age to those who can pro­vide it with lower ad­min­is­tra­tive mar­gins.</p>
    <p>Last year, only two in­sur­ers were able to keep their com­bined man­age­ment and dis­tri­bu­tion cost to un­der 20 per cent of pre­mi­ums col­lected.</p>
    <p>One in­surer used more than half the pre­mi­ums col­lected on man­age­ment and dis­tri­bu­tion costs.</p>
    <p>With so much of the health dol­lar go­ing to pay­ment for things not di­rectly re­lated to health pro­ce­dures for pa­tients, it’s not at all sur­pris­ing to see pre­mi­ums soar­ing.</p>
    <p>Agents con­tinue col­lect­ing pre­mi­ums as long as the pol­i­cy­holder re­mains with the in­surer.</p>
    <p>While the com­mis­sion is high­est in the first few years and drops to a much smaller amount in the years that fol­low, is the per­pet­ual pay­ment of com­mis­sion jus­ti­fied?</p>
    <p>The ar­gu­ment is that the agents help pol­i­cy­hold­ers when they need to make claims. But there are peo­ple with health in­sur­ance who have not made a sin­gle claim in decades.</p>
    <p>Per­haps those who want such ser­vice from agents should pay for it sep­a­rately, and not with Medis­ave money. Such ser­vice should also not be manda­tory, so pol­i­cy­hold­ers who do not re­quire it should pay lower pre­mi­ums.</p>
    <p>Of course, the best out­come would be for the in­surer to take on this role and to stop pay­ing com­mis­sions to agents af­ter a fixed num­ber of years, and for the MAS to cap the com­mis­sion payable, since it comes from Medis­ave.</p>
    <p>POR­TA­BLE HEALTH IN­SUR­ANCE</p>
    <p>An­other ma­jor prob­lem with IPs is the dif­fi­culty of mov­ing from one in­surer to an­other as a per­son gets older.</p>
    <p>By the time they are in their 50s, most peo­ple have some pre-ex­ist­ing med­i­cal prob­lems that raise their health risks. The most com­mon of them are high blood pres­sure and choles­terol lev­els, and di­a­betes.</p>
    <p>In­sur­ers have dif­fer­ent poli­cies, but gen­er­ally, they won’t ac­cept some­one who is more likely to make claims, un­less they tag on ex­cep­tions.</p>
    <p>In other words, the per­son has to agree not to be cov­ered for cer­tain con­di­tions. For ex­am­ple, a per­son with early-stage kid­ney prob­lems may not be cov­ered for kid­ney fail­ure, or even for heart dis­ease or stroke.</p>
    <p>This de­feats the pur­pose of in­sur­ance, since the ex­emp­tions are the con­di­tions these peo­ple are most likely to need cov­er­age for.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, be­yond a cer­tain age, it be­comes prac­ti­cally im­pos­si­ble for peo­ple to switch to an­other in­surer, even if there is a big dif­fer­ence in pre­mi­ums paid.</p>
    <p>Pre­mi­ums for pri­vate hospi­tal IPs for those aged 71 to 73 range from $2,494 to $4,788 a year. The most ex­pen­sive pre­mium is al­most dou­ble that of the cheap­est.</p>
    <p>The dif­fer­ence widens as peo­ple age. For the old­est group – those aged above 90 years – pre­mi­ums range from $5,114 to $12,167 a year.</p>
    <p>Some of the dif­fer­ence may be at­trib­uted to the cov­er­age of­fered. But since most schemes pay “as charged”, the dif­fer­ence in cov­er­age surely can’t jus­tify the huge dif­fer­ence in pre­mi­ums.</p>
    <p>And yet, be­cause it is al­most im­pos­si­ble to move from one in­surer to an­other, pol­i­cy­hold­ers have to bite the bul­let if they want to con­tinue hav­ing that level of cov­er­age.</p>
    <p>In Aus­tralia, the gov­ern­ment has man­dated that health in­sur­ance be por­ta­ble. This means no in­surer can refuse to ac­cept a pol­i­cy­holder from an­other in­surer, or add ex­emp­tions un­less these al­ready ex­ist un­der the pre­vi­ous cov­er­age – as long as it is a move to a scheme that pro­vides sim­i­lar or lower cov­er­age.</p>
    <p>In­tro­duc­ing por­ta­ble health in­sur­ance in Sin­ga­pore would be a great move.</p>
    <p>It will re­quire a lot of back-end work among the in­sur­ers of­fer­ing IP schemes. It will not be easy to set up, but will be cer­tainly be worth the ef­fort in the long run.</p>
    <p>It will give peo­ple the choice of cov­er­age with lower pre­mi­ums with­out in­cur­ring penal­ties.</p>
    <p>It would also force in­sur­ance com­pa­nies to be more care­ful about the pre­mi­ums they charge.</p>
    <p>Some in­sur­ers charge younger peo­ple much lower pre­mi­ums to en­tice them, and raise pre­mi­ums sig­nif­i­cantly when they reach an age at which it be­comes dif­fi­cult for them to switch to an­other in­surer.</p>
    <p>Mak­ing health in­sur­ance por­ta­ble will do away with such a prac­tice.</p>
    <p>This will be good for pol­i­cy­hold­ers and the na­tion as a whole.</p>
