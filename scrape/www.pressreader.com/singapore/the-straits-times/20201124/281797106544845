    <p>The bat­tle against the coro­n­avirus pan­demic is in­ten­si­fy­ing as many coun­tries go through sec­ond or even third waves of the out­break.</p>
    <p>But while cases and fatal­i­ties spike in Europe, Asia or the Amer­i­cas, the re­gion of Africa ap­pears to be fac­ing a less dras­tic im­pact from the virus, with a lower per­cent­age of cases and deaths than oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Africa ac­counts for 17 per cent of the global pop­u­la­tion with over 1.3 bil­lion people, but the con­ti­nent makes up about 4 per cent of global Covid-19 cases, re­ported Reuters.</p>
    <p>As at last Thursday, the con­ti­nent had a lit­tle over two mil­lion cases and more than 48,000 deaths – with a case fa­tal­ity rate among the low­est glob­ally – de­spite the poor health in­fras­truc­ture in many African coun­tries.</p>
    <p>In com­par­i­son, the United States – the world’s worst af­fected coun­try – had more than 11 mil­lion cases and over 250,000 deaths as at last Thursday.</p>
    <p>UNDERCOUNT­ING</p>
    <p>Lim­ited test­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties and patchy data in some parts of Africa could be why it seems to have weath­ered the Covid-19 storm, with some ex­perts point­ing to undercount­ing and un­der-re­port­ing.</p>
    <p>Last month, Dr Mat­shidiso Moeti, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s re­gional di­rec­tor for Africa, said the test­ing level in Africa is still very low com­pared with other con­ti­nents.</p>
    <p>“Most African coun­tries are fo­cused on test­ing trav­ellers, pa­tients or con­tacts, and we es­ti­mate that a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of cases are still missed,” she said.</p>
    <p>QUICK RE­SPONSE</p>
    <p>The virus hit Africa later than other con­ti­nents, giv­ing coun­tries and med­i­cal per­son­nel there time to set up field hospi­tals, source for equip­ment, and also learn from oth­ers’ treat­ment and safety meth­ods.</p>
    <p>The con­ti­nent’s past ex­pe­ri­ence bat­tling other deadly en­demic dis­eases such as Ebola, malaria, tu­ber­cu­lo­sis and cholera also guided its gov­ern­ments’ pub­lic health re­sponses and many were quick to take ac­tion.</p>
    <p>As soon as the first case was con­firmed in Fe­bru­ary in Egypt, some na­tions started early pre­ven­tive mea­sures, such as air­port screen­ing, sus­pend­ing flights from badly af­fected ar­eas, and en­forc­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures and mask wear­ing.</p>
    <p>YOUNG POP­U­LA­TION</p>
    <p>Re­search has found that the risk of de­vel­op­ing se­vere Covid-19 in­creases with age and glob­ally, most of those who have died have been over the age of 80.</p>
    <p>Africa is home to the world’s youngest pop­u­la­tion – with the me­dian age be­ing 19 years – and this is a likely fac­tor in its rel­a­tively low case mor­tal­ity rate, said ex­perts.</p>
    <p>A United Na­tions re­port last year said 62 per cent of sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa’s pop­u­la­tion was un­der 25 and just 3 per cent was 65 or over.</p>
    <p>In com­par­i­son, Europe, North Amer­ica and wealth­ier Asian coun­tries have the old­est in­hab­i­tants.</p>
    <p>The virus is also known to have a higher mor­tal­ity rate for those with health prob­lems such as obe­sity and Type 2 di­a­betes, which are also less com­mon in Africa.</p>
    <p>FAVOURABLE CLI­MATE</p>
    <p>A study con­ducted by re­searchers in the US found a cor­re­la­tion be­tween tem­per­a­ture, hu­mid­ity and lat­i­tude, and that the virus spreads more eas­ily in lower tem­per­a­tures and hu­mid­ity.</p>
    <p>Warm and dry cli­mates pre­vail in Africa with its north­ern and south­ern fringes dom­i­nated by vast stretches of desert con­di­tions. The cen­tral por­tion is wet­ter, with trop­i­cal rain­forests, grass­lands and semi-arid cli­mates.</p>
    <p>African coun­tries far­ther from the trop­ics have been worse off, re­ported the BBC.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the spread of the virus ac­cel­er­ated in South Africa – the most af­fected African coun­try – as the south­ern hemi­sphere went into win­ter around July. But as it be­came warmer in Septem­ber, the num­ber of cases dropped sig­nif­i­cantly.</p>
