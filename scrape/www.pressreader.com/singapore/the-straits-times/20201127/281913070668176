    <p>• A South Korean court yes­ter­day sen­tenced the leader of an on­line sex black­mail ring to 40 years in pri­son, the Yon­hap news agency re­ported.</p>
    <p>Cho Ju-bin, 24, was found guilty of run­ning an on­line net­work that black­mailed at least 74 women, in­clud­ing 16 teenagers, into what the au­thor­i­ties called “vir­tual en­slave­ment” by forc­ing them to send in­creas­ingly de­grad­ing and some­times vi­o­lent sex­ual im­agery of them­selves be­tween May last year and this Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>The Seoul Cen­tral District Court sen­tenced Cho for vi­o­lat­ing crim­i­nal and child pro­tec­tion laws by mak­ing and re­leas­ing pornog­ra­phy and run­ning a crim­i­nal or­gan­i­sa­tion, Yon­hap said.</p>
    <p>Cho’s lawyer could not be reached for com­ment.</p>
    <p>How­ever, when he was taken into po­lice cus­tody in March, Cho said he wanted to apol­o­gise to the vic­tims.</p>
    <p>“The de­fen­dant had lured and threat­ened mul­ti­ple vic­tims in var­i­ous ways to pro­duce pornog­ra­phy and dis­trib­uted it for a long time to many,” Yon­hap re­ported, cit­ing the uniden­ti­fied judge who handed down the verdict and sen­tence.</p>
    <p>Cho “in par­tic­u­lar in­flicted ir­recov­er­able dam­age on many vic­tims by pub­lish­ing their iden­ti­fies”.</p>
    <p>The case sparked a na­tional out­cry, with mil­lions of Kore­ans sign­ing pe­ti­tions urg­ing the au­thor­i­ties to re­lease Cho’s iden­tity and in­ves­ti­gate not only the or­gan­is­ers of the net­work but also its par­tic­i­pants, who paid as much as 1.5 mil­lion won (S$1,810) to see the abu­sive videos and im­ages.</p>
    <p>Po­lice have said that at least 124 sus­pects have been ar­rested and 18 op­er­a­tors of chat rooms on Tele­gram and other so­cial me­dia plat­forms were de­tained fol­low­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tions into sim­i­lar sex­ual crimes since late last year.</p>
