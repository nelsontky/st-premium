    <p>Given the crowds out for a re­lax­ing time at the beaches or throng­ing Or­chard Road and shop­ping malls over the week­end, one might think we have put the threat of Covid-19 be­hind us.</p>
    <p>The only give­away is the sight of masks on peo­ple’s faces. Oth­er­wise, these closely packed crowds make a mock­ery of so­cial dis­tanc­ing. But throw­ing cau­tion to the wind could spell trou­ble.</p>
    <p>Of course, one can em­pathise with the de­sire to see life re­turn to nor­mal.</p>
    <p>Af­ter six months of liv­ing with fear, of tak­ing ex­tra­or­di­nary pre­cau­tions, of stay­ing cooped up, some­times in small homes with large fam­i­lies, many are yearn­ing to let their hair down.</p>
    <p>They are en­cour­aged by the fact that Sin­ga­pore ap­pears to have things un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>The dor­mi­tory in­fec­tion num­bers have been com­ing down. Cases in the com­mu­nity have gone down to an av­er­age of two a day for the past week. There are now only around 100 Covid-19 pa­tients in hospi­tal, and none of them is crit­i­cally ill.</p>
    <p>Yes, Covid-19 is still rag­ing around the world, with 20.5 mil­lion peo­ple in­fected and al­most 750,000 peo­ple dead. But the real crises seem far away – largely in the</p>
    <p>Amer­i­cas, In­dia and Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>True, nearer to home, the Philip­pines and In­done­sia are see­ing high num­bers with thou­sands of new cases daily.</p>
    <p>But Sin­ga­pore has closed its bor­ders and peo­ple al­lowed in have to keep them­selves locked up for 14 days to en­sure they do not trans­mit the virus they might have brought here with them.</p>
    <p>On the face of it, the virus ap­pears to have been checked here and mat­ters seem un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>Even the tough mea­sures im­posed to achieve this state of affairs are grad­u­ally be­ing re­laxed.</p>
    <p>Up to five peo­ple are now al­lowed to dine out to­gether. The au­thor­i­ties have also raised the ceil­ing on the num­ber of peo­ple who can at­tend wed­dings and fu­ner­als.</p>
    <p>Still, re­stric­tions re­main in place to man­age risks, should there be a su­per spreader. It is also im­por­tant to re­main cau­tious and not to push the en­ve­lope too far.</p>
    <p>The low in­fec­tion num­bers in Sin­ga­pore and the greater free­dom to move around are a re­ward for ev­ery­one work­ing to­gether to fight Covid-19.</p>
    <p>If peo­ple start think­ing that the pan­demic is now his­tory in Sin­ga­pore then, as they say, his­tory has a habit of re­peat­ing it­self.</p>
    <p>No one wants an­other round of cir­cuit break­ers.</p>
    <p>Some coun­tries that thought they had beaten Covid-19 are now fac­ing a surge in cases. Ja­pan is now di­ag­nos­ing more than 1,000 new in­fec­tions a day. Aus­tralia, which acted firmly in the state of Vic­to­ria to stamp out a resur­gence, has now brought its num­bers down to about 300 new cases a day.</p>
    <p>Af­ter 102 days with­out new in­fec­tions, New Zealand now has four. How did that hap­pen?</p>
    <p>There is a the­ory that the virus en­tered New Zealand through the freight brought in. This has not been con­firmed, but it re­in­forces the need for vig­i­lance in Sin­ga­pore, which con­tin­ues to al­low goods in and out of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>But Pro­fes­sor Wang Linfa, di­rec­tor of the emerg­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases pro­gramme at Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School, said one of those in­fected worked in a cold store. He said: “Im­por­ta­tion (of the virus) from frozen food is cer­tainly a pos­si­bil­ity if the pro­duce is heav­ily con­tam­i­nated.”</p>
    <p>He said the coro­n­avirus re­mains vi­able for longer in cool con­di­tions – which was what hap­pened with the large clus­ter em­a­nat­ing from the Bei­jing mar­ket.</p>

        <p data-role="text">The bus&#xAD;tle in Bugis Street on Mon&#xAD;day, with the masks on peo&#xAD;ple&#x2019;s faces the only give&#xAD;away that Sin&#xAD;ga&#xAD;pore is still bat&#xAD;tling a pan&#xAD;demic. The cur&#xAD;rently low in&#xAD;fec&#xAD;tion num&#xAD;bers here and the greater free&#xAD;dom to move around are a re&#xAD;ward for ev&#xAD;ery&#xAD;one work&#xAD;ing to&#xAD;gether to fight Covid-19, but Sin&#xAD;ga&#xAD;pore&#xAD;ans must not let their guard down un&#xAD;til the whole world is safe again.</p>
