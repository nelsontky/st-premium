    <p>PARIS • Twelve-time cham­pion Rafael Nadal reached his 13th French Open fi­nal yes­ter­day with a 6-3, 6-3, 7-6 (7-0) win over Ar­gentina’s Diego Schwartz­man, set­ting up a ti­tle clash to­mor­row against No­vak Djokovic or Ste­fanos Tsit­si­pas.</p>
    <p>For 34-year-old Nadal, it was a 99th win – with only two losses – at Roland Gar­ros since his 2005 de­but and put him just one vic­tory away from equalling Roger Fed­erer’s men’s record of 20 Grand Slam sin­gles ti­tles. He is also into his 28th fi­nal at the Ma­jors.</p>
    <p>“It’s al­ways spe­cial to play here, to be in the fi­nal an­other time – it’s al­ways a spe­cial moment,” said the world No. 2 Spa­niard, who is now 124-2 in best-of-five matches on clay and has yet to drop a set in this year’s French Open.</p>
    <p>“I made a couple of mis­takes (af­ter win­ning the first two sets). He played some good points. I then missed two vol­leys. I know against Diego he makes more breaks with­out a doubt.</p>
    <p>“I lost to him in Rome re­cently so I know it’d be a tough match.</p>
    <p>“Three days ago he played an amaz­ing match against Do­minic Thiem. I looked at what hap­pened in that match and what hap­pened in Rome and tried to change that.</p>
    <p>“Happy the way that I played. I have been im­prov­ing and to­day has been a very pos­i­tive match for me.”</p>
    <p>Nadal was beaten by the 12th seed a lit­tle over two weeks ago in Rome but he showed he was still the undis­puted king of Roland Gar­ros as he notched up a 10th win in 11 meet­ings over the Ar­gen­tinian.</p>
    <p>Schwartz­man, play­ing his first Grand Slam semi-fi­nal, had two break points in the open­ing game but Nadal saved both to win the game af­ter bat­tling for 14 minutes.</p>
    <p>The Spa­niard went on to break twice in each of the first two sets.</p>
    <p>The duo traded dou­ble ser­vice breaks in the third set be­fore Nadal aced the tiebreak.</p>
    <p>Schwartz­man, 28, found the net with a re­turn to hand Nadal vic­tory in 3hr 9min.</p>
    <p>Djokovic, the 2016 cham­pion in Paris and chas­ing an 18th Grand Slam ti­tle, took on Greek fifth seed Tsit­si­pas in the sec­ond semi-fi­nal later yes­ter­day. The re­sult was un­avail­able at press time.</p>
    <p>The world No. 1 is bid­ding to be­come the first man in half a cen­tury to win all four Slams twice.</p>
