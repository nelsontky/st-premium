    <p>MUM­BAI • The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has hit women world­wide with j ob losses and clo­sures of child­care cen­tres. Yet a sur­pris­ing bright spot is emerg­ing: In­dia’s US$200 bil­lion (S$268.4 bil­lion) tech­nol­ogy ser­vices in­dus­try, where new rules are ex­pected to pro­vide fe­male work­ers with a broad swathe of flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments and fresh em­ploy­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>On the out­skirts of New Delhi, Ms Teena Likhari, 45, quit her job run­ning op­er­a­tions for the In­dian back of­fice of a Sil­i­con Val­ley com­pany in 2018 be­cause of a fam­ily med­i­cal emer­gency. Look­ing to re­join the work­force this year, she ex­pected a mar­ket stunted by lock­downs.</p>
    <p>Not only did the op­er­a­tions man­ager quickly land a job with In­dian out­sourcer WNS Global Ser­vices, but work­ing from her home in the city of Gur­gaon, she be­gan over­see­ing a 100-mem­ber team in the city of Pune about 1,450km away.</p>
    <p>Ms Likhari is one of the early ben­e­fi­cia­ries of In­dia’s de­ci­sion to lift decades-old re­stric­tions on re­mote work in back-of­fice firms be­cause of the pan­demic. The tech ser­vices in­dus­try – one of the coun­try’s most im­por­tant fi­nan­cially – can now al­low em­ploy­ees to shift from tra­di­tional of­fices to work­from-any­where ar­range­ments, per­ma­nently if needed.</p>
    <p>In­dian women, who have of­ten had to sac­ri­fice for their hus­bands’ ca­reers or other com­mit­ments at home, have much to gain from the pol­icy change. “Even a year ago, an op­er­a­tions leader work­ing re­motely would’ve been unimag­in­able,” said Ms Likhari.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s large num­bers of English­s­peak­ing grad­u­ates and lower costs rel­a­tive to the West have spawned a sprawl­ing in­dus­try that is of­ten called the world’s back of­fice be­cause of its global reach.</p>
    <p>The broad out­sourc­ing sec­tor, which in­cludes tech­nol­ogy ser­vices in ad­di­tion to busi­ness pro­cesses, em­ploys about 4.5 mil­lion peo­ple. For­eign banks from Deutsche Bank to Bar­clays run cen­tres han­dling ev­ery­thing from global pay­rolls to tech­nol­ogy in­fra­struc­ture main­te­nance for them­selves and clients.</p>
    <p>Such new norms are par­tic­u­larly sig­nif­i­cant in In­dia. So­cial con­ven­tions that re­quired a woman to move to her hus­band’s lo­ca­tions or stay with fam­ily in small towns, or sim­ply be avail­able i nside the home to care for el­ders and chil­dren, have shut out mil­lions of qual­i­fied fe­male work­ers.</p>
    <p>Greater flex­i­bil­ity and the op­por­tu­nity to work from any­where would give them choices they have never had be­fore.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s old rules – orig­i­nally de­signed to pre­vent mis­use of leased tele­com lines – had pre­vented per­ma­nent work from home ar­range­ments in back of­fices. But the pan­demic pushed the gov­ern­ment to re­move decades-old reporting obli­ga­tions, such as those re­quir­ing com­pa­nies to pro­vide of­fice net­work di­a­grams in or­der to get in­ter­na­tional com­mu­ni­ca­tion cir­cuit al­lo­ca­tions. The changes opened the door for peo­ple to work from home on a long-term ba­sis.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies like WNS, which caters to the likes of Vir­gin At­lantic Air­ways, Tesco and Avon Prod­ucts, are en­vis­ag­ing a hy­brid of­fice and home model, satel­lite of­fices in small ci­ties and a blend of full­time em­ploy­ees and gig work­ers.</p>
    <p>“We’ll see work go­ing to peo­ple rather than peo­ple go­ing to work,” said Mr Ke­shav Mu­rugesh, group chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of WNS which em­ploys 43,000 work­ers glob­ally, nearly 30,000 of them in In­dia. “With flex­i­ble hours or se­lected work days, over 100 mil­lion In­dian women with sec­ondary de­grees could po­ten­tially find em­ploy­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mum­bai-head­quar­tered Tata Con­sul­tancy, clos­ing in on half a mil­lion work­ers, has com­mit­ted to a strat­egy that by 2025, only 25 per cent of its work­force will be work­ing in­side an of­fice at any one time.</p>
    <p>“Given time and lo­ca­tion flex­i­bil­ity, fewer women will quit af­ter hav­ing chil­dren,” said chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer N.G. Subra­ma­niam of Tata Con­sul­tancy, Asia’s largest out­sourcer with US$22 bil­lion in an­nual rev­enue. “More women will stay in the work­force, more will reach se­nior lead­er­ship lev­els.”</p>
    <p>Most of the back-of­fice out­sourc­ing cen­tres are lo­cated in sprawl­ing cam­puses within big ci­ties like Ban­ga­lore or New Delhi. Bar­clays, for in­stance, has over 20,000 work­ers pro­vid­ing tech­nol­ogy so­lu­tions glob­ally and UBS Group has 6,000 em­ploy­ees, about a third of them in Mum­bai alone. Deutsche Bank em­ploys 11,500, nearly half of whom are in the neigh­bour­ing city of Pune. Most of these work­ers have been op­er­at­ing from home dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“There is so much tal­ent i n smaller ci­ties that has been un­tapped so far,” said Deutsche Bank In­dia head of hu­man re­sources Madhavi Lall. “Flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments would cer­tainly bring that tal­ent to the fore, es­pe­cially women who find it dif­fi­cult to mi­grate or shift their base.”</p>
