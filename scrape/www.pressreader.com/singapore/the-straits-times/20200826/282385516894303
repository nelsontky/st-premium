    <p>Too tired to get out of bed to an­swer the door­bell? Per­haps you need a smart video door­bell such as the Arlo Video Door­bell, which lets you view and talk to visi­tors through a smart­phone app.</p>
    <p>Launched in Sin­ga­pore at the end of June, the Arlo Video Door­bell is the first smart video door­bell from Arlo, which is known for its home se­cu­rity cam­eras.</p>
    <p>Un­like most video door­bells that have cam­eras with a 16:9 as­pect ra­tio, the Arlo’s cam­era has a 1:1 as­pect ra­tio that pro­duces a square im­age with a greater ver­ti­cal field of view.</p>
    <p>As­sum­ing you mount the door­bell at shoul­der height, you should be able to see pack­ages left in front of the door.</p>
    <p>In my test­ing, I was able to see most pack­ages ex­cept thin and small ones such as a let­ter – with the cam­era mounted shoul­der height at the side of my door.</p>
    <p>The Arlo Video Door­bell is a wired model that uses the wiring of your ex­ist­ing door­bell for power, as well as tap­ping your chime for au­dio.</p>
    <p>Hence, it is trick­ier to in­stall than its bat­tery-op­er­ated peers, as you have to re­move your ex­ist­ing door­bell and con­nect the elec­tri­cal wires to it. Al­though the Arlo app pro­vides a thor­ough walk-through of the in­stal­la­tion process, I rec­om­mend hir­ing an elec­tri­cian if you are un­sure.</p>
    <p>It uses the same user-friendly Arlo app (avail­able for iOS and An­droid) as Arlo’s cam­eras. But un­like them, it does not re­quire an Arlo SmartHub or base sta­tion – the door­bell con­nects di­rectly to your home router via Wi-Fi.</p>
    <p>There is, how­ever, a good rea­son to want an Arlo base sta­tion – you can pair the door­bell with it to record and store videos in a USB­con­nected drive or mi­croSD card (de­pend­ing on the model of the base sta­tion).</p>
    <p>The door­bell l acks any lo­cal stor­age for videos and you can view videos only in real time. But it comes with a three-month trial for the Arlo Smart ser­vice (from $4.49 a month), which pro­vides 30-day rolling cloud video record­ings and smart no­ti­fi­ca­tions that can, for in­stance, dis­tin­guish between a per­son and an an­i­mal.</p>
    <p>The video qual­ity is ex­cel­lent, es­pe­cially with high dy­namic range (HDR) en­abled, but ob­jects look slightly curved from lens dis­tor­tion.</p>
    <p>The cam­era has night vi­sion up to about 6m, but I did not test this as my door­way is well-lit.</p>
    <p>When the cam­era de­tects mo­tion, it sends an app alert to your phone. If the vis­i­tor pro­ceeds to press the door­bell, you will re­ceive a phone call.</p>
    <p>You can ei­ther an­swer the call and talk to your vis­i­tor or re­spond us­ing five pre-recorded mes­sages that cover most com­mon sce­nar­ios, such as ask­ing a courier to leave the pack­age out­side. There is also an op­tion for the vis­i­tor to leave a mes­sage if he does not get a re­sponse to a call af­ter 20 sec­onds.</p>
    <p>The door­bell speaker is loud at the max­i­mum vol­ume. I rec­om­mend set­ting it at 50 per cent or lower so as not to star­tle your vis­i­tor.</p>
    <p>Like Arlo’s cam­eras, the door­bell sup­ports Ama­zon Alexa and Google As­sis­tant. You can speak to these vir­tual as­sis­tants to get the door­bell to per­form a hand­ful of tasks, in­clud­ing stream­ing the live­cam­era view on a smart dis­play such as Ama­zon Echo Show or Google Nest Hub.</p>
    <p>At $279, the Arlo Video Door­bell is priced com­pet­i­tively against the smart door­bells from mar­ket leader Ring, which are in the $300 range.</p>
