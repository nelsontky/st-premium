    <p>TOKYO • Ja­pan’s Olympic bad­minton cham­pion Ayaka Taka­hashi will not de­fend her dou­bles crown with Misaki Mat­su­tomo at next year’s Tokyo Games after an­nounc­ing that she will re­tire at the end of the month.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese pair de­feated Dan­ish duo Kamilla Ryt­ter Juhl and Christinna Ped­er­sen to win the women’s dou­bles gold medal and their na­tion’s first bad­minton ti­tle at the 2016 Rio Games.</p>
    <p>Taka­hashi, 30, cited the 12-month post­pone­ment of the Tokyo Olympics due to the Covid-19 pan­demic as one of the rea­sons for her de­ci­sion to step away, say­ing her body might not hold up for an­other year.</p>
    <p>Next year’s Games is slated to start on July 23 and end on Aug 8 fol­low­ing the con­fir­ma­tion of post­pone­ment ear­lier in March.</p>
    <p>“I’ve de­cided to end my ca­reer on Aug 31 as I had doubts as to whether my in­ner fire and body would get through an­other year,” she told a news con­fer­ence on Wed­nes­day. “For me, it has al­ways been all or noth­ing. When I train, I train, when I rest, I rest.</p>
    <p>“When I shared my hon­est feel­ings with my part­ner Mat­su­tomo and (my em­ployer) Ni­hon Unisys, they re­spected my de­ci­sion. My par­ents were un­der­stand­ing as well, and telling them was a big weight off my shoul­ders.”</p>
    <p>Taka­hashi and Mat­su­tomo, 28, were dou­bles part­ners for over a decade and last played to­gether at the All Eng­land Open in March, where they de­feated the topranked Chi­nese pair­ing of Chen Qingchen and Jia Yi­fan en route to the semi-fi­nals.</p>
    <p>“I have no re­grets about this de­ci­sion. I thought the match at the All Eng­land could be the last for me as we were not sure at that time whether the Olympic qual­i­fy­ing race would con­tinue,” she said.</p>
    <p>“That is why I wanted to play my best and we man­aged to beat them. I am proud of my achieve­ments.”</p>
    <p>Her re­tire­ment leaves men’s world No. 1 Kento Mo­mota as Ja­pan’s best bad­minton gold medal hope at Tokyo 2020.</p>
    <p>The 25-year-old was in­jured in a car accident in Jan­uary, hours after win­ning the Malaysia Mas­ters.</p>
    <p>Al­though he has re­cov­ered, he has not played com­pet­i­tively since.</p>
    <p>This year’s All Eng­land tour­na­ment was the last bad­minton event to be staged, with the cir­cuit on ice be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
