    <p>Malaysia expects to pay Sin­ga­pore less than $270 mil­lion for the ter­mi­na­tion of the high-speed rail project, Malaysian Cab­i­net min­is­ter Mustapa Mo­hamed said, adding that the coun­try would hon­our its com­pen­sa­tion obli­ga­tions. Malaysia had let the deal lapse af­ter both sides could not agree to changes it had pro­posed.</p>
    <p>Malaysia had al­lowed the bi­lat­eral agree­ment to lapse on the dead­line of Dec 31, 2020, af­ter both sides could not agree to changes it had pro­posed. Sin­ga­pore’s Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said in Par­lia­ment that costs in­curred so far in­cluded abortive costs for con­sul­tancy ser­vices, de­sign of in­fra­struc­ture and man­power re­quired.</p>
    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysia expects to pay less than $270 mil­lion to Sin­ga­pore for the ter­mi­na­tion of the high-speed rail (HSR) project, said a Cab­i­net min­is­ter who was deeply in­volved in dis­cus­sions on the project.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Mustapa Mo­hamed, Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Depart­ment (Econ­omy), was re­fer­ring to re­marks in the Sin­ga­pore Par­lia­ment on Mon­day by Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung that the Re­pub­lic has spent about $270 mil­lion on the project.</p>
    <p>“The Trans­port Min­is­ter also said the com­pen­sa­tion would not in­clude l and costs and we are made to un­der­stand that the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment has ac­quired sev­eral pieces of land to im­ple­ment the project.</p>
    <p>“There­fore, we are con­fi­dent that the com­pen­sa­tion cost will be much lower than $270 mil­lion. Any­way, the mat­ter has not been fi­nalised and will be dis­cussed soon,” Mr Mustapa said in an in­ter­view on Astro Awani TV sta­tion on Mon­day evening, as quoted by Ber­nama news agency.</p>
    <p>Malaysia had al­lowed the bi­lat­eral agree­ment to lapse on the dead­line of Dec 31, 2020, af­ter both sides could not agree to changes it had pro­posed.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said in Par­lia­ment that costs in­curred so far in­cluded abortive costs for con­sul­tancy ser­vices, de­sign of in­fra­struc­ture and man­power re­quired.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore re­ceived some $15 mil­lion from Malaysia in 2019, aris­ing from the lat­ter’s re­quest to sus­pend the project in 2018.</p>
    <p>The com­pen­sa­tion amount and the sched­ule for pay­ment are both spec­i­fied in the le­gal agree­ments, said Mr Ong. But due to con­fi­den­tial­ity obli­ga­tions, Sin­ga­pore can­not re­veal the ex­act terms of com­pen­sa­tion for the ter­mi­na­tion of the HSR project, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said the com­pen­sa­tion will not in­clude land ac­qui­si­tion costs, since the value of the land can be re­cov­ered. There is also a small com­po­nent of mis­cel­la­neous abortive costs that Sin­ga­pore is cur­rently ver­i­fy­ing, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Mustapa said Malaysia will hon­our its obli­ga­tions on the com­pen­sa­tion, and both coun­tries will ini­ti­ate the nec­es­sary pro­ce­dures to de­ter­mine the amount.</p>
    <p>Mr Mustapa wrote on Face­book on Mon­day that the com­pen­sa­tion amount can­not be dis­closed as both coun­tries are bound by a con­fi­den­tial­ity clause in the agree­ment. But he said in the TV in­ter­view that the gov­ern­ment would an­nounce the com­pen­sa­tion amount as soon as it is fi­nalised, Ber­nama re­ported.</p>
    <p>RE­MOV­ING ASSETSCO</p>
    <p>Ex­plain­ing why the Malaysian gov­ern­ment wanted to re­move the ser­vices of As­sets Com­pany (AssetsCo) dur­ing the HSR dis­cus­sions, Mr Mustapa said the gov­ern­ment would have saved 30 per cent of costs by not us­ing its ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said on Mon­day that Sin­ga­pore could not ac­cept Malaysia’s pro­posal to re­move AssetsCo, the sys­tems sup­plier and net­work op­er­a­tor of the HSR project, as it con­sti­tuted a “fun­da­men­tal de­par­ture” from the orig­i­nal agree­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said this “par­tic­u­larly sig­nif­i­cant change” to re­move AssetsCo – which was nec­es­sary to pro­tect the in­ter­ests of both coun­tries – had led to the ter­mi­na­tion of the Kuala Lumpur-Sin­ga­pore HSR project.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Mustapa on the TV pro­gramme: “The Malaysian gov­ern­ment had given a 30-year guar­an­tee to AssetsCo amount­ing to RM60 billion (S$19.7 billion), or about RM2 billion an­nu­ally.</p>
    <p>“The guar­an­tee would mean that if the pay­ments to AssetsCo were less than RM60 billion, the gov­ern­ment must pay by us­ing other rev­enue to cover the gap. This is also a form of sav­ings,” he said, as quoted by Ber­nama.</p>
    <p>Mr Mustapa was fur­ther quoted as say­ing that tak­ing into ac­count the de­sign, sta­tions and other things with the ap­proach with­out AssetsCo, the over­all es­ti­mated cost sav­ings was 30 per cent.</p>
    <p>Malaysia, the Cab­i­net min­is­ter said, is still in­ter­ested to con­tinue the HSR project but the Covid-19 pan­demic has forced the gov­ern­ment to re­view the im­ple­men­ta­tion model.</p>
    <p>“Ac­cord­ing to a study, the ben­e­fits to the econ­omy over 50 years would to­tal about RM300 billion. The ben­e­fits are great, which is why we are still keen to im­ple­ment the project.</p>
    <p>“It’s only the model, or method, that we felt may not be ap­pro­pri­ate amid the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion,” he said, as quoted by the news agency.</p>
