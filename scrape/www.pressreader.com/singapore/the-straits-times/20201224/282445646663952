    <p>Ac­tor Kurt Rus­sell played Santa Claus in 2018’s The Christ­mas Chron­i­cles, an ad­ven­ture com­edy that saw sib­lings Kate (Darby Camp) and Teddy (Ju­dah Lewis) sneak into his sleigh, which then crashes and spills all the presents, ru­in­ing the hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>The kids even­tu­ally team up with Santa to save Christ­mas – and they do it all over again in the se­quel, The Christ­mas Chron­i­cles 2.</p>
    <p>But this time, there is a much big­ger role for a char­ac­ter who has been some­what ne­glected in Christ­mas fic­tion: Mrs Claus, played by Rus­sell’s real-life part­ner Goldie Hawn.</p>
    <p>Hawn made a brief ap­pear­ance as Santa’s wife in the first film and it was Rus­sell, 69, who had the idea to cast her. He says: “Be­cause the minute you have me play­ing Santa Claus, sub­con­sciously the au­di­ence starts think­ing of Mrs Claus as you know who.”</p>
    <p>The star of the western The Hate­ful Eight (2015) and ac­tion hits such as Es­cape From New York (1981) sat down with Hawn to chat with the press over Zoom.</p>
    <p>Even though Mrs Claus is usu­ally side­lined in Santa tales and was “just a sug­ges­tion in the first one”, he and di­rec­tor Chris Colum­bus (Home Alone, 1990) de­cided they “wanted to bring Mrs Claus to the fore” in the se­quel.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause she’s a big part of Santa’s world, the North Pole and the elves’ lives, and the first one was a teaser, if you will,” Rus­sell says.</p>
    <p>So when a now teenage Kate re­turns to the North Pole for a new ad­ven­ture, she dis­cov­ers that Mrs Claus has for­mi­da­ble pow­ers of her own and plays a key role in the magic of Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>Hawn, 75, re­calls that in the first film, the part was so small that she “didn’t re­ally have a char­ac­ter, Mrs Claus wasn’t re­ally writ­ten”.</p>
    <p>But for the fol­low-up, the film­mak­ers “came up with a great char­ac­ter, whom I was ex­cited to play be­cause she was mag­i­cal”, says the comedic star of films such as Over­board (1987) and The First Wives Club (1996).</p>
    <p>“And I wanted to play a cur­rent fe­male char­ac­ter,” the ac­tress adds. “I didn’t want to play any­thing that was sort of an ar­chaic fe­male char­ac­ter who just bakes cook­ies.</p>
    <p>“There’s noth­ing wrong with bak­ing cook­ies, but I wanted her to be more present. And they did, and made her a beau­ti­ful char­ac­ter. So I was very happy to play her.”</p>
    <p>And Rus­sell says if there are more in­stal­ments in the fran­chise, “it’s cer­tainly opened the door to ex­plor­ing who this woman was, what she has gone through and be­come”.</p>
    <p>But while their char­ac­ters in the film em­body ev­ery­thing good about Christ­mas, the cou­ple do be­lieve the hol­i­day has a bit of a dark side be­cause of how com­mer­cialised it is to­day.</p>
    <p>Rus­sell points out that ad­ver­tise­ments for the hol­i­day pe­riod now start as early as Oc­to­ber in the United States.</p>
    <p>“It’s too early, guys, let’s hold on to the spe­cial-ness of Christ­mas. The time pe­riod, for me, should be 21/ weeks be­fore Christ­mas,” says</p>
    <p>2 the ac­tor, whose fam­ily with Hawn in­cludes their three ac­tor chil­dren – Rus­sell and Hawn’s son Wy­att Rus­sell, 34; and Hawn’s chil­dren from a pre­vi­ous mar­riage, Kate Hud­son, 41, and Oliver Hud­son, 44.</p>
    <p>Hawn fondly re­mem­bers a time when she could not af­ford ex­pen­sive gifts.</p>
    <p>“When I was a dancer in the 1970s and had l ots of dancer friends, we didn’t make a lot of money and it was so fan­tas­tic to ac­tu­ally get some­thing like a sweater or a hat my girl­friend made for me. And I made lots of presents too.</p>
    <p>“One day, I’d love to have a Christ­mas where we don’t go to the store, but ev­ery­body makes some­thing for one an­other. There’s some­thing so nice about that.”</p>
