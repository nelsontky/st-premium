    <p>Lo­cal ac­tor Mark Lee’s turn as a white-col­lar worker who be­comes a drag per­former in Num­ber 1 is de­serv­ing of his Golden Horse nom­i­na­tion, says John Lui.</p>
    <p>REVIEW / COMEDY NUM­BER 1 (NC16) 98 min­utes/Now show­ing/</p>
    <p>The story: Re­trenched civil en­gi­neer Chow Chee Beng (Mark Lee), des­per­ate for work, takes up a job at a night­club. He finds the job en­tails much more than he bar­gained for. He has to man­age a group of drag per­form­ers, a task which dis­mays him as he has grown up think­ing that the cross­ing of gen­der lines is un­nat­u­ral.</p>
    <p>John Lui</p>
    <p>You would ex­pect a movie cen­tred on a night­club with a drag show to be drenched in fab­u­lous­ness and this work de­liv­ers – the eye­lashes go out to there, the dresses are shim­mery and the mu­si­cal num­bers keep on com­ing.</p>
    <p>In­deed, the queens do a Hokkien ver­sion of It’s Rain­ing Men that per­fectly sum­marises the movie: Ah Beng in drag won­der­land.</p>
    <p>To make the point, Lee’s char­ac­ter is ac­tu­ally given that name. Through his eyes, the au­di­ences take a peek un­der the wigs and make-up, so to speak. And they do, but not to the ex­tent one would ex­pect.</p>
    <p>Beng, a good dad to his chil­dren and lov­ing hus­band to wife Marie (Gina Tan), is front and cen­tre through­out. Lee breaks out of the cast­ing box that has pegged him as Loud­mouth Bully for much of his ca­reer and turns in a con­fi­dently re­strained per­for­mance – you never feel he has over­stayed his wel­come on screen.</p>
    <p>Direc­tor Ong Kuo Sin (the comedy Mr Un­be­liev­able, 2015) makes Beng an easy char­ac­ter to like and Lee’s Golden Horse nom­i­na­tion for Best Ac­tor is de­served.</p>
    <p>Un­like, say, Roys­ton Tan’s 881 (2007), which has getai per­form­ers tak­ing the lead in a movie set in the world of getai, or the clas­sic comedy The Ad­ven­tures Of Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert (1994), about a troupe tak­ing a drag show across ru­ral Aus­tralia, this movie’s pro­tag­o­nist is a fam­ily man. His strug­gles are meant to be re­lat­able. A lot of it is eco­nomic – he fights to keep his fancy car and up­per-mid­dle-class lifestyle, for ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>Not only is it stuff movie­go­ers have seen be­fore, but the thread of eco­nomic anx­i­ety also never comes to a con­clu­sion, one of sev­eral here milked for a skit or two be­fore van­ish­ing from the story.</p>
    <p>On the side­lines and beg­ging to be dived into are the lives of sev­eral gay men and at least one trans­gen­der char­ac­ter, played by trans­gen­der ac­tress Ki­we­baby Chang from Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>When their lives are shown, it is to elicit pity for the hate they live with or to win praise for be­ing ex­em­plary ci­ti­zens who per­form char­ity work.</p>
    <p>Some might see it as a timid step taken to fight ho­mo­pho­bia and trans­pho­bia, but by the stan­dards of mass-ap­peal come­dies here, it’s a gi­ant leap.</p>
