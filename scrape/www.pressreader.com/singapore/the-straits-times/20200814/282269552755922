    <p>At Burberry’s new­est store in Shen­zhen, China, you can dig­i­tally per­son­alise your fit­ting room’s in­te­rior and mu­sic, ac­cess styling op­tions for items of cloth­ing and un­lock a se­cret “in­ter­ac­tive weather” room – all through so­cial me­dia app WeChat.</p>
    <p>These func­tions are part of the im­mer­sive dig­i­tal ex­pe­ri­ence Burberry hopes to give its cus­tomers. The Bri­tish fash­ion house un­veiled its “so­cial re­tail” store in Shen­zhen, China’s tech­nol­ogy hub, on July 31.</p>
    <p>Cre­ated from a part­ner­ship with In­ter­net ser­vices gi­ant Ten­cent, which owns WeChat, the store blends phys­i­cal and dig­i­tal worlds by tap­ping WeChat’s ex­ten­sive net­work and so­cial me­dia ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>In an ex­clu­sive Zoom in­ter­view with The Straits Times, Burberry’s se­nior vice-pres­i­dent of dig­i­tal com­merce Mark Mor­ris ex­plains that “every­thing ex­ists within the WeChat en­vi­ron­ment”.</p>
    <p>Through a WeChat mini pro­gramme Ten­cent cre­ated, vis­i­tors can do things like book an ap­point­ment with a store as­so­ciate or make a reser­va­tion at the in-store cafe.</p>
    <p>With ev­ery on­line in­ter­ac­tion – a like, share, book­ing or pur­chase – vis­i­tors “step up the level of so­cial cur­rency”, pro­gress­ing to un­lock more fea­tures within the store such as ex­clu­sive items on the cafe menu.</p>
    <p>“This is a way of re­ward­ing phys­i­cal in­ter­ac­tions and mak­ing the ex­pe­ri­ence more holis­tic for cus­tomers. It’s in­tended as a sort of fun dis­cov­er­abil­ity – peo­ple like un­lock­ing and play­ing with these things,” says Mr Mor­ris, ad­ding that the pro­gramme goes be­yond of­fer­ing in-store ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>On the con­cept of so­cial cur­rency, he lists Gi­phys and aug­ment­e­dreal­ity in­ter­ac­tions as “play­ful, share­able con­tent” a vis­i­tor can con­tinue to en­gage with even after he or she leaves the store.</p>
    <p>“Those two sides of the puz­zle gain value from each other – your on­line life de­vel­ops from what you do in-store, and your in-store life de­vel­ops based on what you do on­line.”</p>
    <p>The cy­cle of omni-chan­nel en­gage­ment keeps peo­ple com­ing back, he says.</p>
    <p>When look­ing at cus­tomer be­hav­iour, Burberry re­alised peo­ple were very so­cial when re­search­ing a brand or prod­uct, but still wanted a lot of the tra­di­tional ex­pe­ri­ences of a store, Mr Mor­ris adds.</p>
    <p>“Es­sen­tially, peo­ple like to be so­cial at the be­gin­ning of their jour­ney; still crave the hu­man, tra­di­tional com­po­nents of lux­ury within the store visit; and then want to share and en­gage again in a so­cial en­vi­ron­ment once they fin­ish their jour­ney.”</p>
    <p>China has proven to be a key dig­i­tal mar­ket for Burberry, with “a very hun­gry so­cial au­di­ence”.</p>
    <p>The house re­cently did a Chi­naex­clu­sive bag col­lab­o­ra­tion with Chi­nese in­flu­encer Tao Liang (pro­fes­sion­ally known as Mr Bags). All 100 pieces of the limited-edi­tion pocket bag sold out in 31 sec­onds “just from peo­ple buy­ing di­rectly within WeChat”, Mr Mor­ris says.</p>
    <p>Be­yond that, Burberry has seen a di­rect in­crease in dig­i­tal sales over the years, with 80 per cent of cus­tomers hav­ing some form of on­line en­gage­ment with the brand.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieved Shen­zhen was the right place for the store, with a young, fash­ion-for­ward and tech­savvy au­di­ence.”</p>
    <p>DIG­I­TAL NOT A THREAT</p>
    <p>Given the lux­ury mar­ket’s no­to­ri­ous re­sis­tance to en­ter­ing the dig­i­tal space, a store like this is cer­tainly a bold in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>But the Bri­tish house known for its trench coats has made its mark as a leader in dig­i­tal in­no­va­tion in the last 10 years.</p>
    <p>In 2010, Burberry was the first lux­ury brand to live-stream a run­way show on­line. It be­came the first lux­ury brand to launch an e-com­merce web­site (burberry.com) in 2011 and an In­sta­gram ac­count in 2013.</p>
    <p>And in 2018, it launched a monthly shop­ping series, re­leas­ing lim­it­ededi­tion pieces ex­clu­sively through its so­cial me­dia ac­counts, avail­able for pur­chase only for 24 hours.</p>
    <p>Last year, the brand de­buted its first game, B Bounce, with an an­i­mated deer as the main char­ac­ter, pay­ing homage to chief cre­ative of­fi­cer Ric­cardo Tisci’s use of the deer mo­tif in Burberry’s his­tory.</p>
    <p>A game might seem off-brand for a lux­ury house, but it serves a larger pur­pose in cre­ative sto­ry­telling, says Mr Mor­ris.</p>
    <p>Ele­ments pep­pered through­out – the deer char­ac­ter and a race track shaped like the TB (short for Burberry founder Thomas Burberry) mono­gram – help cre­ate “a kind of vis­ual lan­guage that both en­hances the prod­uct and plays a role in so­cialto-phys­i­cal en­gage­ment”.</p>
    <p>The brand ex­panded on that this year with a mul­ti­player game, B Surf, where play­ers can im­merse them­selves in the world of the la­bel’s sum­mer cam­paign while com­pet­ing with friends. Play­ers se­lect a surf­board and dress their char­ac­ter in out­fits from the col­lec­tion, be­fore rac­ing on wa­ter around the TB-shaped track.</p>
    <p>The house has seen it pay off both in the short and long term, says Mr Mor­ris.</p>
    <p>The short-term ob­jec­tive of sell­ing the sum­mer cam­paign prod­ucts was achieved. Be­yond that, B Surf brought “the en­ergy and ex­cite­ment of sum­mer” to change the per­cep­tion of Burberry as an out­er­wear brand syn­ony­mous with win­ter.</p>
    <p>“We’re not a game-maker. But we have a clear idea of what we’re try­ing to achieve as a lux­ury fash­ion brand, and we use our dig­i­tal ca­pa­bil­i­ties to sup­port that.”</p>
    <p>Where other brands might go wrong is view­ing dig­i­tal as just a chan­nel, he says. “The key to how dig­i­tal adds value to lux­ury is un­der­stand­ing that it’s not just about com­merce – it’s about brand and in­spi­ra­tion paired with com­merce.”</p>
    <p>Lux­ury re­mains a “very hu­man in­dus­try”, where cus­tomers de­sire el­e­vated ser­vice and con­nec­tion. So a lot of the in­no­va­tion at Burberry has more to do with driv­ing in-store rather than on­line sales.</p>
    <p>“It is about ad­ding to that over­all end-to-end cus­tomer ex­pe­ri­ence. You’re us­ing tech to en­hance that as­so­ciate ex­pe­ri­ence and con­nec­tion – but in no way re­plac­ing the store.”</p>
    <p>Asked how one might strike a bal­ance be­tween go­ing dig­i­tal and re­tain­ing lux­ury pres­tige, he says: “Dig­i­tal is a lux­ury ex­pe­ri­ence if done well.”</p>
    <p>In­ter­act­ing with a cus­tomer has to be holis­tic and sin­cere, where the brand knows the buyer both on­line and off­line.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, if you bought a Burberry trench on­line, you should have an as­so­ciate reach out to you years later, ask­ing, ‘Would you like that trench re­proofed?’” he says. “That, to me, is lux­ury.”</p>
    <p>Those sim­ply rush­ing for a slice of the dig­i­tal pie may run into pit­falls such as a con­flict be­tween one’s on­line and off­line busi­ness or a poor over­all ex­pe­ri­ence when cus­tomers start ex­pect­ing om­nichan­nel ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The most im­por­tant thing, he says, is know­ing what a brand’s pur­pose is.</p>
    <p>For Burberry, founded in 1856, that means “a bal­ance of brand and com­merce, where dig­i­tal is used to en­hance the her­itage of the brand and tell its story in a mod­ern way”.</p>
    <p>While the house is ex­plor­ing dig­i­tal con­cepts outside of China, the Shen­zhen store re­mains a nov­elty.</p>
    <p>Due to the na­ture of the Ten­cent part­ner­ship, repli­cat­ing the store in other mar­kets would re­quire Burberry to work with more part­ners, Mr Mor­ris says.</p>
    <p>“But I wouldn’t say it’s some­thing that’s unique to China. The Shen­zhen store is a real jump­ing-off point for the next five years of plan­ning what dig­i­tal in­no­va­tion looks like for Burberry.”</p>
    <p>Peo­ple like to be so­cial at the be­gin­ning of their jour­ney; still crave the hu­man, tra­di­tional com­po­nents of lux­ury within the store visit; and then want to share and en­gage again in a so­cial en­vi­ron­ment once they fin­ish their jour­ney.</p>
