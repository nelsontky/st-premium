    <p>IMOLA • Lewis Hamil­ton may go on to win 10 world drivers’ ti­tles, but his sta­tus as the great­est could be un­der­mined by a lack of true ri­vals, ac­cord­ing to two of Bri­tain’s best-known for­mer rac­ers.</p>
    <p>Martin Brun­dle and Da­mon Hill both agreed the six-time Formula One cham­pion is a de­served suc­cess story, with the for­mer say­ing he felt priv­i­leged to wit­ness his feats.</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton last Sun­day claimed a record 92nd win, one clear of seven-time world cham­pion Michael Schu­macher’s 14-year record of 91 wins.</p>
    <p>Hill, the 1996 world cham­pion, be­lieves Hamil­ton needs to be chal­lenged by and beat an­other driver of the same cal­i­bre if he is to si­lence the doubters.</p>
    <p>“There’s a risk that Lewis’ achieve­ments will be mea­sured against the in­ten­sity of his com­pe­ti­tion,” said Hill, who had to beat Schu­macher to win his ti­tle. “Mercedes have to­tally dom­i­nated this era and Lewis is not chal­lenged.”</p>
    <p>Brun­dle said he would not be sur­prised if Hamil­ton won 10 cham­pi­onships. “I’m not sure we ever thought any­body would ap­proach, let alone sur­pass, Michael Schu­macher’s tally of 91 vic­to­ries,” the com­men­ta­tor told Sky Sports be­fore adding “and I think there’s a long way to go yet”.</p>
    <p>He added that Hamil­ton, like Schu­macher, says he is not in­ter­ested in statis­tics, but did this only to de­flect pres­sure.</p>
    <p>“I could see Lewis aim­ing at some­thing like 10 frankly and a long way north of 100 vic­to­ries.”</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton will be seek­ing to help Mercedes seal an un­prece­dented sev­enth con­sec­u­tive con­struc­tors’ ti­tle at this week­end’s Emilia Ro­magna Grand Prix amid much spec­u­la­tion about his fu­ture.</p>
    <p>He is out of con­tract this year and F1 is head­ing to­wards a likely salary cap for drivers in 2023. Re­ports have sug­gested he wants to im­prove on his cur­rent deal, said to be worth around €40 mil­lion (S$64 mil­lion) a sea­son while Mercedes want to cut costs.</p>
    <p>Team boss Toto Wolff is also out of con­tract this year, but like Hamil­ton, has said he wants to stay with the team – and would much pre­fer to se­cure the cham­pion on a multi-year deal in­stead of a one-year ex­ten­sion.</p>
