    <p>The num­ber of Amer­i­cans who have turned out for early vot­ing is set­ting records with just two weeks to go to the United States pres­i­den­tial elec­tion. En­thu­si­asm in the Demo­cratic Party’s base is spell­ing dan­ger for Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s re-elec­tion bid.</p>
    <p>Early vot­ing is re­ported to be set­ting records with just two weeks to go to the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, point­ing to en­thu­si­asm in the Demo­cratic Party’s base which spells dan­ger for Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s bid for re-elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Take the state of Ge­or­gia, in the south­ern United States, for in­stance. As at noon on Sun­day, 1,451,131 vot­ers had al­ready cast bal­lots – a 152 per cent in­crease over the same point in 2016. Vot­ing by ab­sen­tee bal­lots has shot up 648 per cent over 2016.</p>
    <p>“Early vot­ing records are be­ing bro­ken each day,” the At­lanta Jour­nal-Con­sti­tu­tion re­ported on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Var­i­ous analy­ses show that more than six times as many Democrats have cast their bal­lots than at the same point in 2016.</p>
    <p>Na­tion­wide, 28 mil­lion have voted and African Amer­i­cans, tra­di­tion­ally a ma­jor part of the Demo­cratic base, are a big part of that num­ber.</p>
    <p>In North Carolina, which be­gan early vot­ing last Thurs­day, black vot­ers ac­counted for more than 30 per cent of the turnout on the first day – well above their 23 per cent share over­all in 2016, the Wash­ing­ton Post re­ported.</p>
    <p>In Ge­or­gia, black vot­ers ac­counted for about 32 per cent of mail and in-per­son votes cast through last Thurs­day, also out­pac­ing their over­all share of the elec­torate in 2016.</p>
    <p>African-Amer­i­can Demo­cratic poll­ster Cor­nell Belcher told the Wash­ing­ton Post: “There is no group of Amer­i­cans who are more vested in this demo­cratic ex­per­i­ment, his­tor­i­cally, than the black per­son in the United States of Amer­ica. Black peo­ple are lit­er­ally vot­ing like their lives de­pend on it.”</p>
    <p>But no­body is writ­ing off Pres­i­dent Trump. Delv­ing deeply into sep­a­rate polling data shows that he has made gains among some groups – like younger African Amer­i­cans, col­lege-ed­u­cated His­pan­ics and col­lege-ed­u­cated white peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­cans pre­fer vot­ing in per­son. Mr Trump’s sup­port base may be nar­row but is fa­nat­i­cally loyal, and mid-western states that pow­ered him to the White House with a nar­row mar­gin of vic­tory en­abling him to win the Elec­toral Col­lege, while los­ing the pop­u­lar vote in 2016, will mostly vote in per­son on Nov 3.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent has also been ques­tion­ing the in­tegrity of the elec­toral process it­self, in par­tic­u­lar mail-in bal­lots – and has been urg­ing vot­ers to go to the polls in per­son. There is thus less of an im­per­a­tive for his sup­port­ers to vote early.</p>
    <p>“I can’t help but look at this data with the lens of Trump telling Repub­li­cans so con­sis­tently that voteby-mail is a scam,” data firm Hawk­fish chief ex­ec­u­tive Josh Men­del­sohn told Ax­ios. “That dis­trust – it bears out in this data.”</p>
    <p>Cer­tainly, Mr Trump is run­ning 10.5 points be­hind chal­lenger Joe Bi­den na­tion­ally, and seven to 7.5 points be­hind in tipping states, ac­cord­ing to statis­ti­cian Nate Sil­ver, founder of the FiveThir­tyEight web­site which tracks poll data.</p>
    <p>But he em­pha­sised that the Pres­i­dent’s chances are not zero.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump still has a 12 per cent chance of win­ning the Elec­toral Col­lege, ac­cord­ing to a FiveThir­tyEight model as at Sun­day af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately the Cook Po­lit­i­cal Re­port’s run­ning Elec­toral Col­lege es­ti­mates project Democrats win­ning 290 elec­toral votes in the “solid, likely and lean” cat­e­gories.</p>
    <p>The magic num­ber that spells a ma­jor­ity in the Elec­toral Col­lege is 270.</p>
    <p>In 2016, Mr Trump won 304 in what was seen as one of the great­est po­lit­i­cal up­sets in mod­ern his­tory.</p>
    <p>cal news out­lets, with names like Des Moines Sun, Ann Ar­bor Times and Em­pire State To­day. But be­hind the scenes, many of the sto­ries are directed by po­lit­i­cal groups and cor­po­rate PR firms to pro­mote a Repub­li­can can­di­date or to smear their ri­vals.</p>
    <p>The net­work is largely over­seen by Mr Brian Tim­pone, a TV re­porter turned In­ter­net en­trepreneur. He has built the net­work with the help of sev­eral oth­ers, in­clud­ing a Texas brand man­age­ment con­sul­tant and a con­ser­va­tive Chicago ra­dio per­son­al­ity.</p>
    <p>NY­Times un­cov­ered de­tails about the op­er­a­tion through in­ter­views with more than 30 cur­rent and former em­ploy­ees and clients as well as thou­sands of in­ter­nal emails between re­porters and ed­i­tors span­ning sev­eral years.</p>
    <p>Mr Tim­pone did not re­spond to re­peated at­tempts to con­tact him. Many of his ex­ec­u­tives did not re­spond to, or de­clined, re­quests for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Tim­pone’s net­work has more than twice as many sites as the na­tion’s largest news­pa­per chain, Gan­nett. While Mr Tim­pone’s sites gen­er­ally do not post in­for­ma­tion that is out­right false, the op­er­a­tion is rooted in de­cep­tion, es­chew­ing hall­marks of news re­port­ing like fair­ness and trans­parency.</p>
    <p>Most of the sites de­clare in their “About” pages that they aim “to pro­vide ob­jec­tive, data-driven in­for­ma­tion with­out po­lit­i­cal bias”.</p>
    <p>But in April, an edi­tor for the net­work re­minded free­lancers that “clients want a po­lit­i­cally con­ser­va­tive fo­cus on their sto­ries, so avoid writ­ing sto­ries that only fo­cus on a Demo­crat law­maker, Bill, etc”, ac­cord­ing to an e-mail viewed by NY­Times.</p>
    <p>The com­pa­nies that run the sites have re­ceived at least US$1.7 mil­lion from Repub­li­can po­lit­i­cal cam­paigns and con­ser­va­tive groups, ac­cord­ing to tax records and cam­paign fi­nance re­ports.</p>
    <p>Mr Ian Prior, a Repub­li­can op­er­a­tive, was be­hind the ar­ti­cles about Ms Gideon. He pre­vi­ously worked for the Se­nate Lead­er­ship Fund, a po­lit­i­cal ac­tion com­mit­tee that has spent US$9.7 mil­lion against Ms Gideon.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Ms Collins, the Maine sen­a­tor, said the cam­paign an­swers ques­tions “from me­dia out­lets of all stripes and per­sua­sions”.</p>
    <p>Mr Prior leads a PR firm, and said in an e-mail that he pitches sto­ries to a va­ri­ety of out­lets. He did not re­spond to ques­tions about whether he had paid for the cov­er­age.</p>
    <p>Mr Ben Ashkar, chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer of Lo­cal­ity Labs, one of the com­pa­nies con­nected to the sites, said he did not think peo­ple would pay for cov­er­age.</p>
    <p>“I hope not,” he said. “How would I know? Hon­estly, I don’t think peo­ple are pay­ing.”</p>
    <p>Ms Jeanne Ives, a Repub­li­can can­di­date for the US House in Illi­nois, paid Mr Tim­pone’s com­pa­nies US$55,000 over the past three years, ac­cord­ing to state and fed­eral records. Dur­ing that time, the Illi­nois sites have pub­lished over­whelm­ingly pos­i­tive cov­er­age of her, in­clud­ing run­ning some of her news re­leases ver­ba­tim.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view, she said her pay­ments were to cre­ate her web­site and mon­i­tor her Wikipedia page.</p>
    <p>Asked if she was pay­ing for pos­i­tive cov­er­age, she replied: “Oh, no, there’s none of that go­ing on, I as­sure you.”</p>
