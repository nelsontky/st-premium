    <p>Even as Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic out­look wors­ens, there prob­a­bly will not be a sharp spike in mort­gagee sales this year be­cause of gov­ern­ment re­lief mea­sures such as the de­fer­ment of loan re­pay­ments, and banks hold­ing off on fore­clo­sures un­til the loan de­fer­ment pe­riod ends.</p>
    <p>Even as Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic out­look wors­ens, there prob­a­bly will not be a sharp spike in mort­gagee sales this year be­cause of gov­ern­ment re­lief mea­sures such as a de­fer­ment of loan re­pay­ments, and banks hold­ing off on fore­clo­sures un­til the loan de­fer­ment pe­riod ends.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, real es­tate auc­tions were suspended dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker for nearly two months un­til June 1, and even now, auc­tions are still not al­lowed as phys­i­cal gath­er­ings of more than five peo­ple are for­bid­den, an­a­lysts said.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Knight Frank Re­search, the total num­ber of mort­gagee list­ings for the first half of this year dropped to 177, from 305 in the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Mort­gagee sales re­fer to prop­er­ties that are re­pos­sessed by banks and fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions when those who mort­gage these prop­er­ties de­fault on their loans. The bank can then sell them on the open mar­ket to re­cover the out­stand­ing amount.</p>
    <p>While the pan­demic-fu­elled re­ces­sion has yet to run its course, the Gov­ern­ment has pro­vided re­lief in the form of de­ferred re­pay­ments of loans un­til Dec 31 to home own­ers and busi­nesses, an­a­lysts said.</p>
    <p>From April 6, distressed prop­erty own­ers can ask to de­fer both prin­ci­pal and in­ter­est pay­ments, or just the prin­ci­pal pay­ments, un­til Dec 31. Nearly 34,000 mort­gage loans now en­joy de­fer­ment of prin­ci­pal or in­ter­est pay­ments, or both.</p>
    <p>Many fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions have also ex­tended pay­ment de­fer­ments to in­di­vid­u­als with com­mer­cial or in­dus­trial prop­erty loans.</p>
    <p>Also, el­i­gi­ble small and medi­um­sized en­ter­prises have been able, from April 6, to de­fer their prin­ci­pal pay­ments on their se­cured term loans un­til Dec 31. More than 5,300 SME se­cured loans now en­joy re­pay­ment de­fer­ments till the end of the year.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, this may mean fewer mort­gagee prop­er­ties listed on the mar­ket this year, com­pared with last year when mort­gagee list­ings hit a 13-year high at 657, ac­cord­ing to Ms Mok Sze Sze, JLL’s head of auc­tions and sales for Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>While the num­ber of list­ings from now till the year’s end may in­crease, it will likely not ex­ceed last year’s num­bers, she added.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, the num­ber of mort­gagee sales by auc­tion for this year is ex­pected to be lack­lus­tre.</p>
    <p>With only one mort­gagee sale done by auc­tion by Knight Frank in the first quar­ter, it is highly un­likely that this year’s total will ex­ceed 10, said Ms Sharon Lee, Knight Frank Sin­ga­pore’s head of auc­tions and sales. This com­pares with 11 mort­gagee sales by auc­tion last year.</p>
    <p>There were a few fore­clo­sure sales that trans­acted at close to the guide price, she added. “But most banks are still look­ing to sell above the forced sale value, or they may con­sider leas­ing the units if these have been on the mar­ket for many months,” Ms Lee said.</p>
    <p>But 2021 is a whole new ball game, once the de­ferred re­pay­ment pe­riod ends.</p>
    <p>Mr Steven Tan, se­nior di­rec­tor of in­vest­ment ser­vices at Col­liers In­ter­na­tional, said he ex­pects more mort­gagee list­ings next year if un­em­ploy­ment and busi­ness clo­sures in­crease and busi­ness con­di­tions worsen, should the pan­demic and geopo­lit­i­cal ten­sions con­tinue to es­ca­late.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee added: “If that hap­pens, the strata re­tail seg­ment may be the most af­fected due to its di­rect ex­po­sure to dis­rup­tions brought on by the pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>While the pan­demic-fu­elled re­ces­sion has yet to run its course, the Gov­ern­ment has pro­vided re­lief in the form of de­ferred re­pay­ments of loans un­til Dec 31 to home own­ers and busi­nesses, an­a­lysts said. From April 6, distressed prop­erty own­ers can ask to de­fer both prin­ci­pal and in­ter­est pay­ments, or just the prin­ci­pal pay­ments, un­til Dec 31. Nearly 34,000 mort­gage loans now en­joy de­fer­ment of prin­ci­pal or in­ter­est pay­ments, or both.</p>
