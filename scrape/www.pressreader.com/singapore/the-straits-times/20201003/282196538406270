    <p>A woman cheated the di­rec­tor of on­line re­tailer Premi­umMall of nearly $220,000 in to­tal af­ter dup­ing the seller of lux­ury goods into be­liev­ing that she had paid for some items, even though no cash was trans­ferred to the firm.</p>
    <p>Hetty Rafeta Rose­lan, 35, was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to two years and four months’ jail af­ter plead­ing guilty to a cheat­ing charge in­volv­ing nearly $130,000. Three other sim­i­lar charges linked to the re­main­ing sum were con­sid­ered dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>Premi­umMall is a re­tailer that sells lux­ury items, such as bags and shoes, on on­line chan­nels in­clud­ing Face­book, Carousell and Lazada.</p>
    <p>Some time in early 2015, Hetty found an ad­ver­tise­ment on Premi­umMall’s Face­book page and de­cided to buy a hand­bag from the re­tailer.</p>
    <p>The job­less Singaporea­n com­mu­ni­cated with Premi­umMall’s di­rec­tor, Ms Lee Bee Yee, 48, via mes­sag­ing app Tele­gram to ar­range for pay­ment to be made in advance via a bank trans­fer.</p>
    <p>Hetty trans­ferred the pay­ment to the firm’s bank ac­count and sent a screen­shot of the trans­ac­tion to Ms Lee. Af­ter ver­i­fy­ing that she had re­ceived the money in the bank ac­count, Ms Lee de­liv­ered the hand­bag to Hetty. Court doc­u­ments did not re­veal the amount in­volved in this trans­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Colin Ng said: “Af­ter sev­eral suc­cess­ful trans­ac­tions with the ac­cused, the vic­tim found the ac­cused to be re­li­able.</p>
    <p>“She would de­liver the items to the ac­cused upon re­ceipt of the screen­shots of the pay­ment de­tails, with­out ver­i­fy­ing that the bank trans­fers were in­deed suc­cess­ful – that the pay­ments were re­ceived in the (firm’s) bank ac­count.”</p>
    <p>Around July 2015, Hetty or­dered a hand­bag from Premi­umMall even though there were in­suf­fi­cient funds in her bank ac­count.</p>
    <p>The DPP said: “As such, while en­ter­ing the pay­ment de­tails to Premi­umMall, the ac­cused de­lib­er­ately opted for the bank trans­fer to be car­ried out on the fol­low­ing day.</p>
    <p>“The ac­cused knew that by do­ing so, she would be able to ob­tain a screen­shot of the pay­ment de­tails be­fore any monies would be trans­ferred to the (firm’s) bank ac­count.”</p>
    <p>Hetty then sent a screen­shot of the trans­ac­tion to Ms Lee, who de­liv­ered the hand­bag on trust with­out en­sur­ing that the money was in the firm’s bank ac­count.</p>
    <p>Us­ing a sim­i­lar method, Hetty con­tin­ued cheat­ing Ms Lee af­ter this.</p>
    <p>Her of­fences fi­nally came to light in 2018, when Premi­umMall con­ducted an in­ter­nal au­dit.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions re­vealed that Hetty had failed to make pay­ments on 161 oc­ca­sions be­tween July 2015 and March 2018.</p>
