    <p>NEW YORK • Pfizer and BioNTech’s Covid-19 vac­cine ap­peared to work against a key mu­ta­tion in the highly trans­mis­si­ble new vari­ants of the coro­n­avirus dis­cov­ered in Bri­tain and South Africa, ac­cord­ing to a l ab­o­ra­tory study con­ducted by the US drug­maker.</p>
    <p>The not-yet peer re­viewed study by Pfizer and sci­en­tists from the Univer­sity of Texas Med­i­cal Branch in­di­cated the vac­cine was ef­fec­tive in neu­tral­is­ing virus with the so-called N501Y mu­ta­tion of the spike pro­tein.</p>
    <p>The mu­ta­tion could be re­spon­si­ble for the virus’ greater trans­mis­si­bil­ity and there had been con­cern it could also make the virus es­cape an­ti­body neu­tral­i­sa­tion elicited by the vac­cine, said Dr Phil Dor</p>
    <p>So we’ve now tested 16 dif­fer­ent mu­ta­tions, and none of them have re­ally had any sig­nif­i­cant im­pact. That’s the good news.</p>
    <p>That doesn’t mean that the 17th won’t.</p>
    <p>mitzer, one of Pfizer’s top vi­ral vac­cine sci­en­tists.</p>
    <p>The study was con­ducted on blood taken from peo­ple who had been given the vac­cine. Its find­ings are lim­ited be­cause it does not look at the full set of mu­ta­tions found in ei­ther of the new vari­ants of the rapidly spread­ing virus.</p>
    <p>Dr Dor­mitzer said it was en­cour­ag­ing that the vac­cine ap­pears ef­fec­tive against the mu­ta­tion, as well as 15 other mu­ta­tions the com­pany has pre­vi­ously tested against.</p>
    <p>“So we’ve now tested 16 dif­fer­ent mu­ta­tions, and none of them have re­ally had any sig­nif­i­cant im­pact. That’s the good news,” he said, adding: “That doesn’t mean that the 17th won’t.”</p>
    <p>Dr Dor­mitzer noted that an­other mu­ta­tion found in the South African vari­ant, called the E484K mu­ta­tion, is also con­cern­ing.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers plan to run sim­i­lar tests to see if the vac­cine is ef­fec­tive against other mu­ta­tions found in the Bri­tish and South African</p>
    <p>vari­ants and hope to have more data within weeks.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists have ex­pressed con­cern that vac­cines be­ing rolled out may not be able to pro­tect against the new vari­ants, par­tic­u­larly the one that emerged in South Africa.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Si­mon Clarke, a cel­lu­lar mi­cro­bi­ol­ogy ex­pert from the Univer­sity of Read­ing, said ear­lier this week that while both vari­ants had some new fea­tures in com­mon, the one found in South Africa “has a num­ber of ad</p>
    <p>di­tional mu­ta­tions” that in­cluded more ex­ten­sive al­ter­ations to the spike pro­tein.</p>
    <p>The Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine and the one from Moderna, which use syn­thetic mes­sen­ger RNA tech­nol­ogy, can be quickly tweaked to ad­dress new mu­ta­tions of a virus if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists have sug­gested that the changes could be made in as lit­tle as six weeks.</p>
