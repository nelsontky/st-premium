    <p>DOHA The Gulf cri­sis which has pit­ted re­gional play­ers against their neigh­bour Qatar could be mov­ing closer to res­o­lu­tion as the key coun­tries pre­pare to meet in Saudi Ara­bia to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Riyadh led a coali­tion of coun­tries in the Gulf and be­yond in 2017 to cut ties with Doha over charges that it was too close to Te­heran and was back­ing rad­i­cal Is­lamist groups. Qatar de­nies the claims.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton has in­ten­si­fied pres­sure on the na­tions im­pos­ing what Qatar calls a “block­ade” to re­solve the cri­sis, in­sist­ing Gulf unity is nec­es­sary to iso­late US ri­val Iran as the cur­tain falls on Mr Don­ald Trump’s pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>The row will top the agenda at to­mor­row’s meet­ing of lead­ers of the Gulf Co­op­er­a­tion Coun­cil in the north-western Saudi city of Al-Ula.</p>
    <p>While Gulf sources say an agree­ment on fur­ther talks and lim­ited con­fi­dence-build­ing mea­sures is ready, not all of the boy­cotting coun­tries have yet signed up.</p>
    <p>The Gulf Co­op­er­a­tion Coun­cil is a bloc com­pris­ing boy­cotting coun­tries Bahrain, Saudi Ara­bia and the United Arab Emi­rates (UAE), neu­tral Kuwait and Oman, and Qatar.</p>
    <p>Af­ter sev­er­ing ties in June 2017, the Saudi-led al­liance sub­se­quently forced out Qatari ex­pa­tri­ate res­i­dents, closed their airspace to Qatari air­craft and sealed their bor­ders and ports, sep­a­rat­ing some mixed-na­tion­al­ity fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>The boy­cotting coun­tries later is­sued a list of 13 de­mands to Doha, in­clud­ing the clo­sure of pan-Arab satel­lite tele­vi­sion chan­nel Al Jazeera, un­der­tak­ings on ter­ror fi­nanc­ing, and the shut­ter­ing of a Turk­ish mil­i­tary base in Qatar.</p>
    <p>Doha has not pub­licly bowed to any of the de­mands.</p>
    <p>The White House has ramped up its rhetoric against Te­heran, hav­ing walked out of an in­ter­na­tional deal to rein in Iran’s nu­clear pro­gramme in 2018.</p>
    <p>US Na­tional Se­cu­rity Ad­viser Robert O’Brien said last Novem­ber that al­low­ing Qatari planes to fly over Saudi Ara­bia via an “air bridge” was a pri­or­ity for the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>In re­turn, an­a­lysts have sug­gested that Qatar could agree to tone down the cov­er­age of Saudi Ara­bia by its me­dia, in­clud­ing the Al Jazeera broad­caster.</p>
    <p>“They will an­nounce the in­terim deal with the emir most likely in at­ten­dance,” said King’s Col­lege Lon­don as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor An­dreas Krieg, adding: “Bahrain has still not signed but all of the other blockad­ing states have.”</p>
    <p>It has re­peat­edly clashed with Qatar over the en­force­ment of mar­itime bound­aries, with sev­eral in­ci­dents in re­cent months that have seen the Qatari coast­guard in­ter­cept Bahraini ves­sels.</p>
    <p>It then flew four of its fighter jets over Qatar’s ter­ri­to­rial wa­ters on Dec 9, Doha has al­leged in a let­ter to the United Na­tions Se­cu­rity Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>Bahrain is act­ing as “a proxy”, said Pro­fes­sor Krieg. “While the UAE and Saudi feel pres­sure to fall in line with US pres­sure, they can use Bahrain as a dis­rup­tor to con­tin­u­ously show their dis­con­tent with Qatar.”</p>
    <p>Ex­perts had warned that the UAE could be the spoiler for any re­gional rec­on­cil­i­a­tion at­tempt, hav­ing heaped crit­i­cism on Qatar and its lead­er­ship since the spat erupted.</p>
    <p>Abu Dhabi’s Min­is­ter of State for For­eign Af­fairs An­war Gar­gash tweeted on Dec 22 that “po­lit­i­cal and so­cial at­mos­pheres in the Gulf are look­ing to end the Qatar cri­sis”, but he com­plained about Qatari me­dia – a long­stand­ing griev­ance in the boy­cotting coun­tries.</p>
    <p>It also re­mains un­clear if Qatar’s ruler, Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Ha­mad Al-Thani, will at­tend the sum­mit in per­son, hav­ing skipped the gath­er­ings since 2017.</p>
    <p>The Saudi For­eign Min­is­ter, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, has said that a res­o­lu­tion of the Gulf diplo­matic cri­sis is in sight, with all gov­ern­ments in­volved on board and a fi­nal agree­ment ex­pected soon.</p>
    <p>Egypt and the UAE have since given their pub­lic sup­port to the ne­go­ti­a­tions, al­though diplo­matic sources say the UAE has been reluc­tant to com­pro­mise.</p>
    <p>The po­ten­tial thaw comes as Gulf states pre­pare for the in­com­ing US ad­min­is­tra­tion of Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den.</p>
