    <p>... via EARLY AD­MIS­SIONS EX­ER­CISE</p>
    <p>When 20-year-old Pear­lyn Tan re­ceived her sec­ond batch of Olevel re­sults af­ter tak­ing the exam again, she was dis­ap­pointed.</p>
    <p>“I thought there was no way I could get into the polytech­nic course that I wanted as it is quite com­pet­i­tive,” she says.</p>
    <p>She wanted to do a diploma in mu­sic and au­dio tech­nol­ogy at Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic, a course which she has now got into three years later, through the Early Ad­mis­sions Ex­er­cise (EAE) scheme for work­ing adults.</p>
    <p>The EAE scheme is an ap­ti­tude-based pro­gramme for stu­dents hold­ing O-level or In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion cer­tifi­cates, or adults with two or more years of rel­e­vant work ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents sub­mit port­fo­lios to their cho­sen poly­tech­nics and are ac­cepted for fac­tors be­yond their aca­demic per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>For Ms Tan, the EAE was a wel­come sur­prise. “I didn’t even know it ex­isted un­til one day, my mother saw some­thing about it in a news­pa­per.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter fin­ish­ing se­condary school at 17, Ms Tan found work as a DJ in lo­cal night­clubs for three years, work­ing on her craft as some­one who wants to pro­duce mu­sic.</p>
    <p>“Dee­jay­ing was some­thing that I started learn­ing in my fi­nal year of se­condary school, but what I re­ally wanted to do was to make my own mu­sic,” she says.</p>
    <p>She is now en­rolled in a course which will help her to achieve her goal. “They are teach­ing us a lot of prac­ti­cal and tech­ni­cal skills which are re­ally valu­able to me as I want to be a pro­ducer in the fu­ture,” she adds.</p>
    <p>The EAE scheme has given her a chance to pur­sue a course that she had al­ways wanted to do.</p>
    <p>“I’m def­i­nitely very thank­ful. I’m glad I’m able to get in through my back­ground in mu­sic rather than just aca­demics alone,” she says.</p>
