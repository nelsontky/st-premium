    <p>• Two 18-year-old men and a 17-year-old woman were to be brought be­fore a French judge as part of the in­quiry into the grisly killing of a teacher who showed stu­dents car­toons of Prophet Muham­mad, ju­di­cial sources said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The three sus­pects, who were de­tained on Tues­day, face charges of “as­so­ci­at­ing with ter­ror­ist crim­i­nals” fol­low­ing the death of Mr Sa­muel Paty near his school in a Paris sub­urb last month.</p>
    <p>Mr Paty, 47, was de­cap­i­tated by an 18-year-old Chechen who re­sponded to a so­cial me­dia cam­paign de­nounc­ing Mr Paty’s use of car­toons re­pub­lished by the satir­i­cal weekly Char­lie Hebdo as part of a class on free­dom of ex­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>At least one of the two men is sus­pected of hav­ing ex­changed text mes­sages with Mr Paty’s killer, Ab­dul­lakh An­zorov, who was shot and killed by po­lice af­ter the at­tack.</p>
    <p>They were de­tained in sep­a­rate re­gions of east­ern France, one source said, hun­dreds of kilo­me­tres from the Paris sub­urb of Con­flans-Sainte-Honorine where Mr Paty was killed, and from the Nor­mandy city of Evreux where An­zorov lived.</p>
    <p>Seven peo­ple have al­ready been charged in the in­ves­ti­ga­tion of Mr Paty’s mur­der, in­clud­ing t wo teenagers aged 14 and 15 who are ac­cused of point­ing out Mr Paty to his killer.</p>
    <p>Also charged is a known Is­lamist rad­i­cal who helped an out­raged fa­ther of one of Mr Paty’s stu­dents stir up a cam­paign against him via so­cial me­dia. The fa­ther has also been charged.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, pros­e­cu­tors in the north­ern city of Cam­brai said three more stu­dents, aged 15 to 17, were charged with “sup­port­ing ter­ror­ism” for threats made dur­ing a na­tional homage to Mr Paty on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar in­ci­dents were re­ported in sev­eral French cities of youth sug­gest­ing Mr Paty had got what he de­served for show­ing the Char­lie Hebdo car­toons that an­gered many Mus­lims and sparked fu­ri­ous protests in sev­eral coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Char­lie Hebdo had re­pub­lished the car­toons in Septem­ber to mark the start of a trial for 14 sus­pects ac­cused of com­plic­ity in the Jan­uary 2015 mas­sacre of 12 peo­ple at the pa­per’s Paris of­fices by two Is­lamist gun­men.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Jean-Michel Blan­quer told RTL ra­dio yes­ter­day that about 400 in­ci­dents dur­ing Paty’s homage had been re­ported, “some ex­pressed mildly, oth­ers more force­fully”.</p>
    <p>But le­gal ac­tion is likely in only about a dozen cases, Mr Blan­quer said.</p>
