    <p>So­cial iso­la­tion dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod re­sulted in lower so­cial sat­is­fac­tion lev­els for se­nior cit­i­zens, ac­cord­ing to re­sults of a monthly sur­vey of about 7,500 peo­ple aged be­tween 55 and 75 here.</p>
    <p>So­cial sat­is­fac­tion lev­els dipped by about 4 per cent in May when com­pared with Jan­u­ary.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, for se­nior cit­i­zens liv­ing with oth­ers, sat­is­fac­tion lev­els fell to the pre-cir­cuit-breaker lev­els of peers liv­ing alone, while those liv­ing alone saw even lower sat­is­fac­tion lev­els, as safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures made it more dif­fi­cult to find sup­port from friends and the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>As of last month, while sat­is­fac­tion lev­els have re­bounded af­ter the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, which was from April 7 to June 1, they are not back to the lev­els they were at be­fore.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19-re­lated find­ings from the May to July it­er­a­tions of the lon­gi­tu­di­nal Sin­ga­pore Life Panel sur­vey, done by Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Uni­ver­sity’s (SMU)</p>
    <p>Cen­tre for Re­search on Suc­cess­ful Age­ing (Rosa), were re­vealed at a me­dia brief­ing yes­ter­day by cen­tre direc­tor Paulin Straughan.</p>
    <p>As Sin­ga­pore’s pop­u­la­tion ages, the pro­por­tion of those who re­main sin­gle and live alone will in­crease, said Pro­fes­sor Straughan, a so­ci­ol­o­gist and for­mer Nom­i­nated MP.</p>
    <p>She added that so­ci­ety will have to be re­designed such that every Sin­ga­porean, re­gard­less of cir­cum­stances, can look for­ward to grow­ing old grace­fully.</p>
    <p>She sug­gested that liv­ing ar­range­ments in­clude an en­clave of so­cial sup­port for se­nior cit­i­zens even while they live in the pri­vacy of their own homes.</p>
    <p>The find­ings also sug­gested that a dig­i­tal di­vide af­fected the well­be­ing of se­nior cit­i­zens. Those who used com­mu­ni­ca­tion tech­nol­ogy – such as phone calls and text and smart­phone apps to mes­sage and video-call oth­ers, as well as so­cial me­dia – re­ported higher lev­els of sat­is­fac­tion and well-be­ing and a lower sense of so­cial iso­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey also showed that older Sin­ga­pore­ans who ex­pe­ri­enced un­fore­seen in­come loss dur­ing the pan­demic re­ported lower life sat­is­fac­tion lev­els. Many in their late 60s and 70s con­tinue to be con­cerned about em­ploy­ment and em­ploy­a­bil­ity, said Prof Straughan.</p>
    <p>It was also an­nounced yes­ter­day that non-profit foun­da­tion Ngee Ann Kongsi would con­trib­ute $15 mil­lion over seven years to SMU to sup­port re­search on the well­be­ing of the el­derly and suc­cess­ful age­ing in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The amount is the largest re­search fund­ing that the uni­ver­sity has re­ceived from a non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion and is also Ngee Ann Kongsi’s largest do­na­tion for re­search to date.</p>
    <p>About $1.5 mil­lion of the fund­ing will go to­wards help­ing Rosa to trans­late re­search into pol­icy in­sights this year.</p>
    <p>In view of the sur­vey find­ings, the re­search team will meet rep­re­sen­ta­tives from the Gov­ern­ment and so­cial ser­vice agen­cies to as­sess the Covid-19 poli­cies im­ple­mented, and look into strength­en­ing cur­rent ini­tia­tives and the devel­op­ment of new ap­proaches to tack­ling is­sues ex­pe­ri­enced by the el­derly.</p>
    <p>Speaker of Par­lia­ment Tan Chuan-Jin, who was guest of hon­our at the me­dia brief­ing, said that re­search in this area is very im­por­tant, given that by 2030, one in four Sin­ga­pore­ans will be 65 or older.</p>
    <p>“We need to en­sure that the qual­ity of life for those who are age­ing is looked af­ter... It’s not just about the health­care sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“It’s also about liv­ing life healthily, phys­i­cally and, from a men­tal health per­spec­tive, be­ing en­gaged,” said Mr Tan, who is also chair­man of the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party Se­niors Group.</p>
