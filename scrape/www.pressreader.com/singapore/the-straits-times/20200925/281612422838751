    <p>Malaysia’s po­lit­i­cal un­cer­tainty deep­ened yes­ter­day with Datuk Seri An­war Ibrahim’s claim that he had se­cured a ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment still highly ques­tion­able. But the move was stir­ring enough de­bate to raise ques­tions about Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s le­git­i­macy to stay in power.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s po­lit­i­cal un­cer­tainty deep­ened yes­ter­day with op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim’s claim that he has se­cured a for­mi­da­ble ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment still highly ques­tion­able.</p>
    <p>But his au­da­cious bid to seize power was stir­ring enough de­bate to raise ques­tions about Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s le­git­i­macy to stay in power.</p>
    <p>The po­lit­i­cal drama was far more sub­dued yes­ter­day com­pared with the day ear­lier, when Datuk Seri An­war de­clared he had se­cured enough sup­port from par­lia­men­tar­i­ans to replace the em­bat­tled ad­min­is­tra­tion of Tan Sri Muhyid­din.</p>
    <p>“The ques­tion many are ask­ing is whether An­war has over­reached once again,” said a long-time aide, re­fer­ring to the episode in 2008 when the former deputy premier said he had se­cured the num­bers to top­ple the gov­ern­ment of then Prime Min­is­ter Ab­dul­lah Badawi.</p>
    <p>But other se­nior op­er­a­tives in the An­war camp re­mained up­beat, ar­gu­ing that their boss had the nec­es­sary num­bers.</p>
    <p>Back­ing for him, they noted, came from fac­tions within Umno, headed by party pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi and his pre­de­ces­sor, former premier Na­jib Razak, who re­mains a pow­er­ful fig­ure in the party de­spite be­ing tainted by the 1Malaysia Devel­op­ment Ber­had scan­dal.</p>
    <p>The sources also in­sisted that a pow­er­ful faction in Sarawak, Gabun­gan Parti Sarawak (GPS), was also back­ing the op­po­si­tion leader in his bid for the premier­ship.</p>
    <p>How­ever, those claims of sup­port have yet to be ac­com­pa­nied by ac­tual public pledges, ei­ther from Umno or GPS, leav­ing Mr An­war very much in po­lit­i­cal limbo for the moment.</p>
    <p>But Mr Muhyid­din is fac­ing prob­lems of his own.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war’s claim of hav­ing se­cured a ma­jor­ity with mem­bers of fac­tions within Umno has raised se­ri­ous ques­tions about Mr Muhyid­din’s wafer-thin ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment, prompt­ing his pre­de­ces­sor and one-time strong­man Ma­hathir Mo­hamad to call for a vote of no con­fi­dence on the cur­rent gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Here is a look at the is­sues and key play­ers in this un­fold­ing saga and the pos­si­ble sce­nar­ios that could shape Malaysia in the com­ing weeks.</p>
    <p>Q How cred­i­ble is Mr An­war’s bid for power?</p>
    <p>A De­spite the scep­ti­cism, there is rea­son to take Mr An­war’s po­lit­i­cal gam­bit se­ri­ously. As one se­nior op­er­a­tive in his Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat (PKR) said: “This is do or die for An­war and if he fails this time around, I re­ally do not see him hav­ing an­other chance.”</p>
    <p>Con­fir­ma­tion from the Palace on Wed­nes­day that Mr An­war had been granted an au­di­ence with the King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ri’ay­atud­din, showed that the op­po­si­tion leader had the nec­es­sary num­bers to be taken se­ri­ously, said the of­fi­cial, even though that meet­ing was later post­poned be­cause the monarch was ad­mit­ted to hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war, who turned 73 last month, has worked to keep to­gether the core of his Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) pact – com­pris­ing PKR, the Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party (DAP) and Parti Amanah Ne­gara – while court­ing other power cen­tres in the coun­try’s frag­mented po­lit­i­cal land­scape.</p>
    <p>Sources said the cru­cial pieces to his gam­bit fell in place 10 days ago when he se­cured sup­port pledges from elected rep­re­sen­ta­tives aligned to Datuk Seri Ah­mad Zahid and Na­jib.</p>
    <p>Q What does Mr An­war need to do next?</p>
    <p>A Un­der the Con­sti­tu­tion, Mr An­war must demon­strate that he has the sup­port of the ma­jor­ity of the MPs in Par­lia­ment. Since Par­lia­ment is not in ses­sion, only Malaysia’s King can re­solve this grow­ing po­lit­i­cal im­passe.</p>
    <p>While his role is largely cer­e­mo­nial, the monarch has the sole power to ap­point the prime min­is­ter he be­lieves to have the ma­jor­ity sup­port of the elected rep­re­sen­ta­tives in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war must se­cure an au­di­ence to show that he has the num­bers and the next cou­ple of days could prove cru­cial. The op­po­si­tion leader will need to se­cure more public pledges of sup­port from elected par­lia­men­tar­i­ans other than from PKR, DAP and Amanah to com­pel the Palace to hold the all-im­por­tant au­di­ence with the King to pave the way for the power tran­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Q What could up­set Mr An­war’s high-stakes po­lit­i­cal gam­bit?</p>
    <p>A The most likely curve­ball is the prospect that the King will al­low Mr Muhyid­din to dis­solve Par­lia­ment and set the stage for a fresh elec­tion. To head off such an out­come, Mr An­war must demon­strate that he has a very com­fort­able ma­jor­ity sup­port, with enough con­tin­gen­cies to up­set any po­ten­tial ap­ple cart.</p>
    <p>Tun Dr Ma­hathir is an­other po­ten­tial spoiler and his pro­cliv­ity to up­set Mr An­war’s plans can­not be un­der­es­ti­mated. But there is a gen­eral con­sen­sus that Dr Ma­hathir is no longer a ma­jor force in the cur­rent po­lit­i­cal land­scape.</p>
    <p>What does this po­lit­i­cal drama mean for Mr Muhyid­din? Even if he sur­vives the latest po­lit­i­cal on­slaught, his coali­tion could still be on thin ice.</p>
    <p>His gov­ern­ment must de­liver its an­nual bud­get in Par­lia­ment in early Novem­ber. If the spend­ing plan is not ap­proved, his gov­ern­ment tech­ni­cally falls, paving the way for an elec­tion.</p>

        <p data-role="text">The placid wa&#xAD;ters of a lake in Pu&#xAD;tra&#xAD;jaya, Malaysia&#x2019;s ad&#xAD;min&#xAD;is&#xAD;tra&#xAD;tive cap&#xAD;i&#xAD;tal, be&#xAD;lie the tur&#xAD;bu&#xAD;lence that has rocked the po&#xAD;lit&#xAD;i&#xAD;cal scene. Prime Min&#xAD;is&#xAD;ter Muhyid&#xAD;din Yassin (left), who has a wafer-thin ma&#xAD;jor&#xAD;ity in Par&#xAD;lia&#xAD;ment, has to stave off a power play from Mr An&#xAD;war Ibrahim (right). Since Par&#xAD;lia&#xAD;ment is not in ses&#xAD;sion, only the King can re&#xAD;solve the con&#xAD;flict.</p>
