    <p>A man ac­cused of Ms Feli­cia Teo Wei Ling’s mur­der in 2007 will be re­manded for three weeks for psy­chi­atric eval­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Ah­mad Da­nial Mo­hamed Rafa’ee’s case will be heard in court again on Jan 28 af­ter the eval­u­a­tion at the Changi Prison Com­plex Med­i­cal Cen­tre. Yes­ter­day, the po­lice told the court that they have com­pleted in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old is rep­re­sented by Mr Shashi Nathan, Ms Ta­nia Chin and Ms Laura Yeo from law firm Withers Khat­tarWong.</p>
    <p>Ah­mad is ac­cused of mur­der­ing Ms Teo, 19, in a Marine Ter­race flat on June 30, 2007.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean is said to have com­mit­ted the of­fence with another man, Ragil Pu­tra Se­tia Suk­marah­jana, now 32. Both men are be­lieved to have been friends with Ms Teo.</p>
    <p>There were no up­dates on the where­abouts of her re­mains and in­ves­ti­ga­tions sur­round­ing Ragil, who is said to be over­seas.</p>
    <p>Ms Teo’s dis­ap­pear­ance made head­lines when her fam­ily and friends ap­pealed for help.</p>
    <p>The last time they saw her was on June 29, 2007, when she left her home in the Bras Basah area.</p>
    <p>Closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion footage later showed her en­ter­ing a lift in a Marine Ter­race hous­ing block with two men. She has not been seen or heard from again. Her mother lodged a miss­ing per­sons po­lice re­port on July 3 that year.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cers ini­tially clas­si­fied Ms Teo’s dis­ap­pear­ance as a miss­ing per­sons case, as they did not find any facts link­ing the two men to her dis­ap­pear­ance.</p>
    <p>The men had ear­lier told of­fi­cers that Ms Teo left the flat of her own ac­cord.</p>
    <p>Her friends and fam­ily then con­ducted their own search and more than 200 peo­ple were in­volved.</p>
    <p>The po­lice con­tin­ued to re­view the case reg­u­larly and fi­nally un­cov­ered new leads af­ter the case was re­ferred to the Crim­i­nal In­ves­ti­ga­tion Depart­ment last July.</p>
    <p>They ar­rested Ah­mad on Dec 15 last year and he was charged with mur­der two days later.</p>
    <p>Of­fend­ers con­victed of mur­der can face the death sen­tence.</p>
