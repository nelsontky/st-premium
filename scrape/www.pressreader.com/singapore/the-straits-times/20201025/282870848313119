    <p>Ms Me­gan Clarken, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Criteo, knows a thing or two about tack­ling ad­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>As a teenage star ath­lete in her na­tive New Zealand, she held the women’s record for long jump and had qual­i­fied to rep­re­sent her coun­try in the 1988 Olympics when a crunch­ing knee in­jury sus­tained on her jump­ing leg put her out of con­tention.</p>
    <p>Three decades later, af­ter a 15-year ca­reer with Nielsen, where she rose to be chief com­mer­cial of­fi­cer, Ms Clarken thought she was all set to be given the top role when the direc­tors de­cided to bring in some­one else.</p>
    <p>She made her dis­ap­point­ment plain, but said she would stay un­til a strate­gic re­view Nielsen was do­ing got com­pleted.</p>
    <p>Once that was done, she took the job at Criteo, an ad­ver­tis­ing technology com­pany that works with In­ter­net re­tail­ers.</p>
    <p>“I love Nielsen and had been very loyal to them for a long time, but it’s very hard to move things there.</p>
    <p>“They are a whale be­cause of what they do,” says the 53-year-old, who next month com­pletes a year in the Criteo job.</p>
    <p>“So, go­ing into a very ag­ile, adapt­able en­vi­ron­ment was also some­thing I was crav­ing. I felt like an old lady mov­ing into that en­vi­ron­ment. I think the av­er­age age (at Criteo) is 32.”</p>
    <p>Ms Clarken had barely got enough time to know key staff at her new work­place when a busi­ness-crit­i­cal is­sue erupted un­ex­pect­edly.</p>
    <p>Google an­nounced in mid-Jan­uary that it would join Sa­fari and Fire­fox in block­ing third-party cook­ies in its Chrome browser, shak­ing up the mar­ket­ing world, which was now re­quired to adapt to the new pri­vacy en­vi­ron­ment and build mar­ket­ing and an­a­lyt­i­cal tools afresh.</p>
    <p>Criteo’s shares tanked, wip­ing off two-thirds of the value of the stock.</p>
    <p>Then, chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer Benoit Fouil­land – whose eight-year ten­ure saw Criteo move from a US$200 mil­lion busi­ness to a US$2.26 billion (S$3.1 billion) en­ter­prise and a Nas­daq list­ing – an­nounced he was leav­ing. He would turn up as CFO of Fir­menich, the world’s largest pri­vately owned per­fume and taste com­pany.</p>
    <p>And, of course, there is the pandemic, which just won’t go away.</p>
    <p>“I have thick skin, so all this is, ‘Okay, let’s get on with it’,” says Ms Clarken, speak­ing from her home in up­state New York, where she has been en­sconced since March, away from her Paris head­quar­ters, thanks to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“But Covid flexes a dif­fer­ent mus­cle group that ev­ery­body has had to ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>Criteo’s shares, cur­rently trad­ing at US$13.83, have more than dou­bled from their 52-week lows, but given the tur­bu­lence all round, there is much work to be done.</p>
    <p>Still, while the eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion is dis­mal around the world, there are some tail winds that, caught at the flood, could lead to for­tune.</p>
    <p>One ob­vi­ous trend, of course, is e-com­merce, ac­cel­er­ated by the lock­downs. While some big re­tail­ers have strug­gled to cope, mid-mar­ket play­ers who learnt to ad­just ap­pear to have done well.</p>
    <p>“Eighty-one per cent of con­sumers are say­ing they won’t go back to the old brand and have tried a new one,” Ms Clarken says, cit­ing stud­ies.</p>
    <p>“When all this lifts, the big brands are go­ing to have to work very, very hard.</p>
    <p>“Se­condly, there is a change in be­hav­iour glob­ally in terms of where search for prod­ucts is be­ing done. Dur­ing Covid, we have seen this steady in­crease in searches go­ing di­rectly to re­tail sites (rather than Google search or Ama­zon).”</p>
    <p>In the Asia-Pa­cific, she adds, an­a­lyt­ics sug­gest that 55 per cent of shop­pers have down­loaded at least one shopping app since Covid-19 ar­rived on the land­scape.</p>
    <p>No sur­prise there. The re­gion is a very app-ori­ented mar­ket­place.</p>
    <p>Criteo helps re­tail­ers with apps, gath­er­ing a fee when a cus­tomer in­stalls an app. Although only a small part of the wider busi­ness, it nev­er­the­less is an im­por­tant part of the Asia-Pa­cific port­fo­lio.</p>
    <p>There have been some ques­tions on whether Criteo has been able to main­tain its abil­ity to re­tain big clients. Ms Clarken says that small re­tail­ers aside, Criteo has started get­ting trac­tion with some big clients, in­clud­ing those who are white la­belling some pieces of what the com­pany of­fers as part of their own tech en­gines.</p>
    <p>White-la­bel prod­ucts are sold by re­tail­ers with their own brand­ing and logo, even as the prod­ucts are cre­ated by third par­ties.</p>
    <p>Now, her chal­lenge is to re­po­si­tion Criteo from be­ing an ad­ver­tis­ing re­tar­get­ing com­pany to the “ad-tech com­pany for the open In­ter­net” at a time when the mar­ket­ing game it­self is chang­ing.</p>
    <p>One ex­am­ple: Brand­ing cam­paigns are mov­ing from prod­uct-fo­cused ad­ver­tise­ments to human-cen­tred ones.</p>
    <p>GUT PUNCH</p>
    <p>That’s one chal­lenge. There’s also the mat­ter of con­sumer pri­vacy and the third-party cook­ies be­ing blocked by Chrome that de­liv­ered a gut punch to busi­nesses such as hers.</p>
    <p>Ms Clarken says she un­der­stands that Google is re­spond­ing to pres­sures to pro­tect peo­ple’s pri­vacy and the re­sponse is le­git­i­mate. But, she adds, con­sumers have rights too.</p>
    <p>“We also be­lieve in the need for the con­sumer to get the best ex­pe­ri­ence that they pos­si­bly can from their dig­i­tal en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>“The dig­i­tal play­ers on the In­ter­net need to work to­gether to come up with what’s next.</p>
    <p>“How do we con­tinue to run our busi­nesses and give con­sumers what they need, while pro­tect­ing their rights? It is a hard one, but we have to do it. Criteo will work it out.”</p>
    <p>If the in­dus­try can­not man­age that, she says, the ads will not get in front of cus­tomers, es­pe­cially so-called con­tex­tual ads.</p>
    <p>Th­ese are a form of tar­geted ad­ver­tis­ing for ads ap­pear­ing on web­sites or other me­dia.</p>
    <p>“Now you have four or five walled gar­dens that rule the world,” she says. “So, it’s a sys­temic prob­lem and it’s a big one for all of us. You prob­a­bly have read that we’re work­ing very closely with Chrome as well and try­ing to re­solve some of th­ese is­sues.”</p>
    <p>Criteo built its rep­u­ta­tion as a re­tar­get­ing com­pany, es­sen­tially one that hits you with ads un­til you be­come a con­vert and buy a prod­uct, or the com­pany fig­ures it can­not in­ter­est you more.</p>
    <p>Lately, Ms Clarken has spo­ken of build­ing “de­mand side plat­forms” which she de­scribes as some­thing of a dat­ing game be­tween peo­ple who buy ad space, or ad­ver­tis­ers, and those who sell space.</p>
    <p>In this world, ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and al­go­rithms will com­bine to iden­tify groups of peo­ple with a high de­gree of sim­i­lar­ity and then pitch those at­tributes to the high­est bid­der who could then fo­cus ads on target au­di­ences.</p>
    <p>The chal­lenge in ad­ver­tis­ing is to get the right mes­sage to the right per­son at the right time on the most con­ve­nient de­vice.</p>
    <p>“The promise of dig­i­tal is that we can give you some­thing that is con­tex­tu­ally in­ter­est­ing to you,” she says. “We have all the ca­pa­bil­ity to do ev­ery­thing up the stack be­cause we have this enor­mous ca­pa­bil­ity at re­tar­get­ing at the bot­tom. We are build­ing out all of the pieces of the program.”</p>
    <p>If ad­ver­tis­ing is so much of a sci­ence, where’s the room for cre­ativ­ity? Do in­flu­encers mat­ter?</p>
    <p>And at what point do ads be­come an intrusion and a nui­sance?</p>
    <p>Ms Clarken says in­flu­encers mat­ter in any en­vi­ron­ment and make for ef­fec­tive am­pli­fiers of mes­sages. And she doesn’t mind stir­ring con­tro­versy by say­ing some of the ad­ver­tis­ing to­day can in­deed be an intrusion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she adds, a lot of that is be­cause cus­tomers are be­ing chased to buy prod­ucts they al­ready own – ads for shoes fol­low­ing you around for a year when you’ve al­ready bought them or do not need them any more.</p>
    <p>Criteo, she says, is de­ter­mined to make sure con­sumers aren’t an­noyed and have the best ex­pe­ri­ence they can pos­si­bly get.</p>
    <p>Whether she man­ages to take Criteo where she wants to will be keenly watched, by the in­dus­try and in­vestors alike.</p>
    <p>If she suc­ceeds, it will be an­other layer to a re­mark­able story of a woman who says she “stum­bled through the 20s” to emerge as a com­puter op­er­a­tor do­ing shift work for nearly a decade.</p>
    <p>Mov­ing across the Tas­man Sea to Aus­tralia, as many of her coun­try peo­ple are wont to do, she worked in IT for Air New Zealand be­fore mov­ing to ninemsn.</p>
    <p>“They were look­ing for any­body who knew any­thing about a com­puter at the time and I could do it,” she quips.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a stint con­sult­ing for News Corp and work­ing for Aka­mai Tech­nolo­gies, she found her niche at Nielsen, which she joined in 2004. In 2013, she moved to New York to run its me­dia op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Among her fortunes she counts hav­ing what she calls a close-knit “func­tion­ing fam­ily” and per­spec­tives on di­ver­sity partly gained in the early years in South Auck­land, when she mixed with Poly­ne­sian chil­dren from poor back­grounds.</p>
    <p>I asked if there was an ath­lete she ad­mired most and the re­sponse was un­hesi­tat­ing: Martina Navratilov­a, the win­ner of 18 Grand Slam sin­gles ti­tles in women’s ten­nis.</p>
    <p>“Some friends of mine are friends of hers and so I had din­ner with her,” says Ms Clarken.</p>
    <p>“And she is just a won­der­ful, won­der­ful human be­ing.”</p>
