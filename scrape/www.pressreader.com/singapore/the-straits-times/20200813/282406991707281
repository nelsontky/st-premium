    <p>DUIS­BURG • Wolver­hamp­ton Wan­der­ers man­ager Nuno Espir­ito Santo was proud of his play­ers de­spite their 1-0 Europa League quar­ter-fi­nal de­feat by Sevilla on Tues­day, and re­fused to blame striker Raul Jimenez for a costly first-half penalty miss.</p>
    <p>Up against a Sevilla team who won three Europa League ti­tles from 2014-16, Wolves gave a good ac­count of them­selves, even though they were play­ing in their 59th match of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Lu­cas Ocam­pos’ late header en­sured their sea­son ended 383 days af­ter it had be­gun.</p>
    <p>“Like I’ve said many times it’s a long jour­ney,” Nuno said. “We wanted to go as far as we could. We came re­ally close to­day.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one is dis­ap­pointed but we should not ig­nore the ef­fort of the play­ers. It’s 14 months of hard work – in the Europa League and the Premier League – and we’ve achieved good things.</p>
    <p>“The dis­ap­point­ment can­not take away from all the good things we’ve been do­ing.”</p>
    <p>Play­ers used by Wolver­hamp­ton in the Premier League last sea­son – the fewest in the field.</p>
    <p>Wolves, who fin­ished sev­enth in the Premier League and missed a Europa League spot for next sea­son, had a golden chance to open the scor­ing at the MSV Arena but Jimenez, nor­mally so re­li­able from the spot, saw his penalty saved.</p>
    <p>“Raul is an amaz­ing player, all the things he does for the team,” Nuno added. “The work, the goals, the tal­ent he has is amaz­ing.”</p>
    <p>But the Por­tuguese also ad­mit­ted that the club will need to bring in new faces in or­der to re­main com­pet­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Wolves used just 21 play­ers in Premier League matches last sea­son – fewer than any other team – while as many as eight play­ers fea­tured in at least 50 games in all com­pe­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>“It’s a small squad and we must be re­ally proud, but now we need to make good de­ci­sions. We need more play­ers that can help us,” Nuno said.</p>
    <p>Sevilla have made the semi-fi­nals of the Uefa Cup/Europa League for the sev­enth time – only In­ter Mi­lan have reached the same stage on more oc­ca­sions – and will face Manch­ester United next in their last­four clash in Cologne on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>“I think we de­served the win,” Sevilla man­ager Julen Lopetegui said. “The key was to chip, chip, chip away, have pa­tience and wait un­til the right mo­ment.</p>
    <p>“We are go­ing to play against Manch­ester United in the next match. They’re the big­gest team in the world but we’re go­ing to be pre­pared for them.”</p>
    <p>In­ter face Shakhtar Donetsk, who thrashed FC Basel 4-1 on Tues­day, in the sec­ond semi-fi­nal next Mon­day.</p>
