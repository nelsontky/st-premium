    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Start on some­thing novel. Your en­ergy is prac­ti­cally forc­ing you to try a new ac­tiv­ity. It could be a project at work or at home.</p>
    <p>Tau­rus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>You may find your home life so ap­peal­ing, you do not want to leave the house. That is fine, as long as you do not make it a life­long habit.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>You can­not get at the root of to­day’s is­sue. Let all the pos­si­bil­i­ties per­co­late through your mind for an­other day.</p>
    <p>Cancer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Fo­cus on per­sonal is­sues. If noth­ing else, that should strengthen you for when oth­ers in your life turn to you in the near fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Your emo­tions are tightly un­der con­trol. Do not walk into sit­u­a­tions that re­quire more flam­boy­ance or pas­sion.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Try not to get tan­gled up in the minu­tiae. Think of the big pic­ture and how best to or­gan­ise your peo­ple to get the best re­sults.</p>
    <p>Li­bra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Dig into life’s lit­tle plea­sures. Things may not be per­fectly sta­ble, but you know how to en­joy your­self. Show some­one else how to do it.</p>
    <p>Scor­pio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Loosen your grip on some­thing or some­one. You do not know what is com­ing next, but you are pretty cer­tain you need to be flex­i­ble.</p>
    <p>Sagit­tar­ius (Nov 22 - Dec 21) You are not in sync with to­day’s work, so try to shift gears. You are bet­ter off do­ing what feels right than what is in front of you.</p>
    <p>Capri­corn (Dec 22 - Jan 19) Some­one close is over­re­act­ing. Give him or her time to freak out, then swoop in to­mor­row with a muf­fin bas­ket or some­thing just as sweet.</p>
    <p>Aquar­ius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Push your­self to walk a lit­tle more or do what­ever you can to ex­er­cise more. You could be­gin a new habit, but only if you do it con­sciously.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>Your emo­tional side is mak­ing a play for con­trol, so see if you can shake things up. You can tell that this is the right way to go.</p>
