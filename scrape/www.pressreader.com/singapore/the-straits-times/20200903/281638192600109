    <p>Sin­ga­pore is ex­pected to face greater eco­nomic un­cer­tainty and tur­bu­lence af­ter the Covid-19 cri­sis, as well as longer-term trends of an age­ing pop­u­la­tion and ris­ing health­care costs.</p>
    <p>These chal­lenges re­quire the coun­try to start think­ing about how to strengthen so­cial safety nets, and the best way to do so, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“The Gov­ern­ment is not ide­o­log­i­cally op­posed to any pro­posed so­lu­tion,” added PM Lee, though he warned that the im­pact of such so­lu­tions has to be as­sessed care­fully.</p>
    <p>“We know greater chal­lenges lie ahead. We need to do more, and we are ready to do more.</p>
    <p>“The ques­tion is: What more will we need to do? And what’s the best way to do it?” he said, speak­ing on the third day of the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s ap­proach to so­lu­tions has al­ways been prag­matic and em­pir­i­cal, with the Gov­ern­ment mak­ing the best use of re­sources to meet the needs of dif­fer­ent groups in so­ci­ety in a tar­geted man­ner, said the Prime Minister.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause if we help ev­ery­one equally, then we are not giv­ing more help to those who need it most.”</p>
    <p>For in­stance, older work­ers, who tend to draw higher salaries than younger work­ers as they have stayed in the work­force longer, may have skills that are less cur­rent.</p>
    <p>They will find it harder to find an­other sim­i­lar job at the same pay if they lose their job. This puts them at greater risk of long-term un­em­ploy­ment, he added.</p>
    <p>So­lu­tions like un­em­ploy­ment in­sur­ance can of­fer older work­ers “tran­sient re­lief” at best, he said.</p>
    <p>A bet­ter ap­proach, he added, is to re­train and up­skill older work­ers, as it will en­able em­ploy­ers to con­tinue find­ing value in them and, in turn, they are less likely to be made re­dun­dant.</p>
    <p>“And if the older worker does get re­trenched, with these skills, he or she can find a new job more eas­ily.</p>
    <p>“The best un­em­ploy­ment in­sur­ance is, in fact, the as­sur­ance of an­other job,” PM Lee said.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment’s ef­forts, sup­ported by unions and em­ploy­ers, have worked, he added, with older work­ers now stay­ing in the work­force longer.</p>
    <p>Schemes like the Work­fare In­come Sup­ple­ment and the Pro­gres­sive Wage Model, which will be ex­tended to more sec­tors over time, have also made a ma­te­rial dif­fer­ence to low-wage work­ers, with real wages of the bot­tom 20 per cent grow­ing con­sis­tently faster than wages in the mid-range, he noted. “That clearly shows that our ap­proaches are work­ing.”</p>
    <p>The Prime Minister said Sin­ga­pore should take some time to assess the land­scape af­ter Covid-19 to see how things un­fold and what spe­cific prob­lems de­velop.</p>
    <p>“We must keep an open mind as we build and im­prove on the sys­tems we have, and con­sider so­lu­tions that can work in our con­text.”</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­pore has pro­gres­sively strength­ened its so­cial safety nets in the past 15 years, and rolled out schemes tar­geted at the lower in­come and those who have fallen on hard times, it found that such peace­time mea­sures were not enough to ad­dress the needs of cit­i­zens amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Thus, emer­gency re­lief mea­sures like the Self-Em­ployed Per­son In­come Re­lief Scheme and the Covid-19 Sup­port Grant were in­tro­duced to of­fer fi­nan­cial aid to af­fected groups, and these re­quired the draw­ing down of past re­serves to fund them.</p>
    <p>“These are emer­gency mea­sures. They are cru­cial for now, but they can­not con­tinue in­def­i­nitely. We have to start think­ing about what comes af­ter them, about the level of so­cial sup­port we will re­turn to, af­ter Covid-19 is over,” he added.</p>
    <p>This work in­volves go­ing be­yond float­ing ideas such as min­i­mum wage or un­em­ploy­ment in­sur­ance, said the PM.</p>
    <p>It re­quires as­sess­ing their im­pact care­fully, in­clud­ing look­ing at who wins and who loses in the work­force, and how small and medi­um­sized en­ter­prises and the pub­lic will be af­fected by the mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“We must iden­tify prag­matic so­lu­tions which will make a real and sus­tain­able dif­fer­ence, and give peo­ple jus­ti­fied as­sur­ance that when they need help, they will get the help that is rel­e­vant to them.</p>
    <p>“And it must not cre­ate new prob­lems in the process, for ex­am­ple, by erod­ing our spirit of self-re­liance.”</p>
