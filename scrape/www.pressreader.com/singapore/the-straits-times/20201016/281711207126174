    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s two-way air travel bub­ble with Hong Kong will pave the way for leisure and other forms of travel be­tween both places.</p>
    <p>While de­tails are still be­ing worked out, peo­ple could be trav­el­ling be­tween both places in sev­eral weeks. Here are an­swers to some com­monly asked questions:</p>
    <p>Q Who can ap­ply?</p>
    <p>A Any­one who has stayed 14 days in the ter­ri­tory of ei­ther party, re­gard­less of age and na­tion­al­ity, will be el­i­gi­ble to travel, Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The only ex­cep­tions so far, at the re­quest of Hong Kong, said Mr Ong, are the for­eign work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>He said that “in the in­ter­est of get­ting this started, we will prob­a­bly ex­clude that group first”, but as the sit­u­a­tion con­tin­ues to sta­bilise, they may be in­cluded in time.</p>
    <p>There will be a quota for the num­ber of flights ply­ing both sides, but nei­ther side has re­vealed numbers.</p>
    <p>De­tails such as how close to the flights the tests would have to be car­ried out, and which air­lines are in­volved, have also not been fi­nalised.</p>
    <p>The launch date of the Sin­ga­poreHong Kong air travel bub­ble and other im­ple­men­ta­tion de­tails will be an­nounced later.</p>
    <p>Q When will flights be launched and how much will they cost?</p>
    <p>A Mr Ong said the price of flights will be “a com­mer­cial de­ci­sion”.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers us­ing the air travel bub­ble will also have to take mu­tu­ally recog­nised Covid-19 poly­merase chain re­ac­tion tests, and test neg­a­tive for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>This is sim­i­lar to the re­quire­ments for the ar­range­ments Sin­ga­pore has with other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times pre­vi­ously re­ported that such tests cost $186.</p>
    <p>Q Why Hong Kong?</p>
    <p>A Hong Kong is the 10th place that Sin­ga­pore has made spe­cial travel ar­range­ments with.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said a key fac­tor in mak­ing such travel ar­range­ment de­ci­sions is en­sur­ing that there are low in­ci­dence rates in both ter­ri­to­ries.</p>
    <p>He noted that both par­ties will have to “agree to a cer­tain in­ci­dence rate that health of­fi­cials on both sides are com­fort­able with”.</p>
    <p>A sec­ond wave of Covid-19 cases is a pos­si­bil­ity, and if it hap­pens, “the agree­ment must have an abil­ity to be scaled back at a very short no­tice”.</p>
    <p>Q How are air travel bub­bles dif­fer­ent from the other schemes in place?</p>
    <p>A Air travel bub­bles are for gen­eral trav­ellers and have no re­quire­ments for a con­trolled itin­er­ary.</p>
    <p>Un­der this agree­ment, there will also be no re­stric­tions on seg­ments of the pop­u­la­tion or pur­pose of travel on both sides.</p>
    <p>Other schemes in place, such as bi­lat­eral green lane ar­range­ments, are for es­sen­tial busi­ness and of­fi­cial travel.</p>
    <p>Uni­lat­eral bor­der open­ings, which are one-sided, “safely lift our bor­der re­stric­tions for these coun­tries and re­gions, and wel­come their trav­ellers”, Mr Ong said pre­vi­ously. Coun­tries in this group are New Zealand, Brunei, Aus­tralia (ex­clud­ing Vic­to­ria) and Viet­nam.</p>
