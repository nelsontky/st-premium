    <p>WASH­ING­TON Van­der­bilt Univer­sity kicker Sarah Fuller (right) made US col­le­giate Amer­i­can foot­ball his­tory on Satur­day, as the first woman to play in a “Power Five” con­test in the Com­modores’ 41-0 loss to Mis­souri.</p>
    <p>Fuller, the goal­keeper for the school’s South­east­ern Con­fer­ence cham­pion women’s foot­ball team, was given the chance to play on the grid­iron af­ter Covid-19 test­ing left Van­der­bilt without a kicker.</p>
    <p>“I was re­ally ex­cited to step out on the field and do my thing,” the 21-year-old said.</p>
    <p>Be­cause Van­der­bilt’s of­fen­sive unit sput­tered, her con­tri­bu­tion was lim­ited to a sin­gle play – the sec­ond-half kick-off.</p>
    <p>She punched the ball to the Mis­souri 35-yard line, a tricky low of­fer­ing com­pared to the usual deeper kicks, where the Tigers fell upon it. Van­der­bilt coach Derek Ma­son said she ex­e­cuted the kick ex­actly as planned.</p>
    <p>Although other women have kicked pre­vi­ously for col­lege teams, Fuller, whose hel­met had the mes­sage “Play like a girl” on the back, was the first woman to play for a ma­jor col­lege Amer­i­can foot­ball pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>“Hon­estly, it’s just so ex­cit­ing,” she said.</p>
    <p>“The fact I can rep­re­sent the lit­tle girls out there who wanted to do this – or thought about play­ing foot­ball or any sport, re­ally – and it en­cour­ages them to be able to step out and do some­thing big like this, it’s so awe­some.”</p>
    <p>Fuller had a 7-2 record for the Com­modores women’s foot­ball team and was pleased to send a mes­sage to young girls who might em­u­late her ex­am­ple in what­ever field they might choose.</p>
    <p>“I just want to tell all the girls out there – you can do any­thing you set your mind to, that’s the No. 1 thing,” she said. “You re­ally can. If you have that men­tal­ity all the way through, you can do big things.</p>
    <p>“All I want to is be a good in­flu­ence to the young girls. There were times that I strug­gled in sports but I am thank­ful I stuck with it.”</p>
    <p>In 1997, Liz Heas­ton be­came the first woman to play and score in a col­lege Amer­i­can foot­ball game when she kicked two ex­tra points in Wil­lamette Univer­sity’s 27-0 win over Lin­field Col­lege.</p>
