    <p>Japan is set to de­clare a lo­calised state of emer­gency over Tokyo and three neigh­bour­ing pre­fec­tures to­day, in a move that is be­ing dis­par­aged as too lit­tle, too late, and too half-hearted to have any im­pact.</p>
    <p>The dec­la­ra­tion is set to take ef­fect from to­mor­row to Feb 7 in the cap­i­tal, Kana­gawa, Saitama and Chiba.</p>
    <p>The mea­sure comes as the Tokyo Olympic Games are set to flag off in less than 200 days. But ques­tions are fast ris­ing over whether Japan can do enough to in­stil con­fi­dence do­mes­ti­cally and in­ter­na­tion­ally so that a safe Games can be held.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga, who has long been re­luc­tant to is­sue any emer­gency de­cree due to the eco­nomic im­pact, has had to backpedal af­ter Covid-19 in­fec­tion</p>
    <p>num­bers rose as quickly as his sup­port ratings tum­bled.</p>
    <p>Japan yes­ter­day busted its one-day na­tional tally, with at least 6,001 new cases. This topped the pre­vi­ous high of 4,913 set on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The surge was led by Tokyo, with its 1,591 fresh cases yes­ter­day top­ping the pre­vi­ous high of 1,337 on New Year’s Eve. But other sta­tis­tics in the cap­i­tal make for grim read­ing: The num­ber of pa­tients in se­ri­ous con­di­tion stood at a new high of 113, while the seven-day av­er­age soared to 1,071 cases.</p>
    <p>Kana­gawa, to the south of Tokyo,</p>
    <p>set its sec­ond-high­est tally of 591 cases yes­ter­day. Saitama to the north and Chiba to the east both rewrote new highs, with 394 and 311 cases re­spec­tively. Worse still, more than 50 per cent of the new cases in Tokyo, Kana­gawa and Chiba have no known trans­mis­sion routes.</p>
    <p>These four pre­fec­tures are home to a to­tal of 36.8 mil­lion peo­ple – one of the world’s most densely pop­u­lated ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Yet, the state of emer­gency is ex­pected to be highly lim­ited in scope and po­ten­tially lack­ing in teeth. It will likely not en­com­pass any fa­cil­ity clo­sures, keep­ing open</p>
    <p>schools, depart­ment stores, sports venues and In­ter­net cafes. Events can still be held, with re­duced ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>Eater­ies, bars, karaoke boxes and pachinko par­lours can still open but must close by 8pm.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts are pes­simistic that this will be enough to bring in­fec­tions in the cap­i­tal re­gion down to man­age­able lev­els within one month.</p>
    <p>In other metropoli­tan ar­eas, in­fec­tions are also fast ris­ing, with new one-day records set yes­ter­day in Osaka (560), Aichi (364) and Fukuoka (316). Ru­ral ar­eas are like­wise see­ing new highs, such as</p>
    <p>Tochigi (131), Gifu (102) and Miyazaki (80).</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment should look into the pos­si­bil­ity of ex­pand­ing the emer­gency dec­la­ra­tion na­tion­wide,” said Japan Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion pres­i­dent Toshio Nak­a­gawa.</p>
    <p>Dr Shigeru Omi, who heads the gov­ern­ment ad­vi­sory panel, was also scep­ti­cal that the sit­u­a­tion could be brought un­der con­trol within one month.</p>
    <p>A study by Ky­oto Univer­sity epi­demi­ol­o­gist Hiroshi Nishiura sug­gested that it could take two months for daily new cases in Tokyo to fall below 100, even if more ag­gres­sive mea­sures are taken.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Mr Suga said dur­ing his New Year press con­fer­ence that prepa­ra­tions for the Olympics are pro­gress­ing steadily, though this note of op­ti­mism comes across as dis­cor­dant to a ma­jor­ity of Ja­panese who ei­ther want the Games to be post­poned again or can­celled.</p>
    <p>The fact that there is still heated de­bate amid the spi­ralling cri­sis ex­em­pli­fies the risks of Japan’s erst­while fluid ap­proach to – as The Asahi Shim­bun crit­i­cised – “wait and see, and hope for the best”.</p>
    <p>Un­like other na­tions, Japan has not laid out spe­cific anti-in­fec­tion lim­its – such as the num­ber of peo­ple al­lowed at gath­er­ings – that will kick in when barom­e­ters – such as the proportion of un­linked cases – are hit.</p>
    <p>Many Twit­ter users said the mea­sures will pro­long ev­ery­one’s agony. One user named Kou said: “With such a per­func­tory state of emer­gency, hold­ing the Olympics will be im­pos­si­ble.”</p>
