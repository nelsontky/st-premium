    <p>Built en­vi­ron­ment com­pa­nies can now sub­mit and process pro­pos­als with­out hav­ing to ap­proach mul­ti­ple agen­cies and re­ceive the nec­es­sary sup­port through a new “on­estop” shop launched by the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity (BCA).</p>
    <p>In­di­vid­u­als who wish to join or progress within the built en­vi­ron­ment in­dus­try can also chart pos­si­ble ca­reer path­ways via a new skills frame­work, Min­is­ter of State in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice and for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Tan Kiat How an­nounced yesterday.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, work has re­sumed at al­most all sus­pended con­struc­tion projects, said Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>He told par­tic­i­pants at the fi­nal we­bi­nar of the In­ter­na­tional Built En­vi­ron­ment Week 2020 that con­trac­tors’ ad­her­ence to safe man­age­ment mea­sures has helped min­imise the im­pact on the progress of con­struc­tion works, even in cases of Covid-19 clus­ters re-emerg­ing in dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the seg­re­ga­tion of work­ers on work­sites has al­lowed the Govern­ment to quar­an­tine only those in the zones af­fected by a new Covid-19 case, he said.</p>
    <p>He noted that the pan­demic has demon­strated how sec­tors that rely on a large for­eign work­force can be vul­ner­a­ble to such dis­rup­tions.</p>
    <p>“We need to press on with our in­dus­try trans­for­ma­tion ef­forts and lever­age even more in­no­va­tive tech­nolo­gies to tackle the chal­lenges and dis­rup­tions posed in a Covid-19 en­vi­ron­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>Through the new Built En­vi­ron­ment Liv­ing Lab­o­ra­tory Frame­work, which func­tions as a “on­estop” shop, firms will be able to gain ac­cess to Govern­ment lab­o­ra­to­ries to test their in­no­va­tions and re­ceive as­sis­tance from agen­cies to en­sure a smooth roll-out.</p>
    <p>Th­ese pro­pos­als can be test-bed­ded at des­ig­nated ar­eas in Pung­gol town and Jurong Lake Gar­den.</p>
    <p>The ser­vice is ad­min­is­tered by the</p>
    <p>Built En­vi­ron­ment Tech­nol­ogy Al­liance, or Beta, and is open to all built en­vi­ron­ment firms and tech­nol­ogy so­lu­tion providers.</p>
    <p>A new skills frame­work, which out­lines pos­si­ble ca­reer paths across or within eight tracks cov­er­ing 49 job roles, is also avail­able to aid in­di­vid­u­als in their ca­reer plan­ning.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies can also use it to as­sess the skill lev­els of their em­ploy­ees and sup­port their ca­reer de­vel­op­ment and skills up­grad­ing where nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Aligned with the Con­struc­tion In­dus­try Trans­for­ma­tion Map, the skills frame­work was jointly de­vel­oped by the BCA, Skill­sFu­ture Sin­ga­pore and Work­force Sin­ga­pore, with in­put from in­dus­try play­ers.</p>
    <p>The con­struc­tion sec­tor is poised to take a $10 bil­lion hit this year, with de­mand drop­ping and projects get­ting pushed back in the wake of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the BCA said con­struc­tion de­mand is ex­pected to re­cover to some ex­tent from next year as public res­i­den­tial de­vel­op­ments and var­i­ous in­fra­struc­ture projects, like the con­struc­tion of the Cross Is­land MRT line, will sup­port de­mand.</p>
    <p>BCA chief ex­ec­u­tive Hugh Lim said: “The skills frame­work for built en­vi­ron­ment will sup­port our col­lec­tive de­sire to have a skilled and pro­gres­sive work­force, to sup­port our shared am­bi­tions for the sec­tor.”</p>
