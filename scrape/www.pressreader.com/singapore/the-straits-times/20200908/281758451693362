    <p>PARIS The French author­i­ties have placed seven more de­part­ments cov­er­ing ma­jor cities such as Lille, Stras­bourg and Dijon on high alert as in­creases in Covid-19 in­fec­tions ac­cel­er­ate.</p>
    <p>Of France’s 101 main­land and overseas de­part­ments, 28 are now con­sid­ered “red zones” where the author­i­ties will be able to im­pose ex­cep­tional mea­sures to slow the num­ber of new coro­n­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>Sun­day’s move came as France re­ported a record of nearly 9,000 daily cases last Fri­day, and a fur­ther 8,550 cases in the past 24 hours on Satur­day, when the na­tion­wide test pos­i­tiv­ity rate in­creased to 4.7 per cent.</p>
    <p>Paris and the Rhone depart­ment en­com­pass­ing the south-eastern city of Lyon were the first to be placed on high alert by the gov­ern­ment on Aug 14 af­ter in­fec­tion rates be­gan to climb.</p>
    <p>That prompted of­fi­cials to make face masks nec­es­sary in all pub­lic spa­ces to slow the virus’ spread, in the hope of avoid­ing a spike in cases that could again over­whelm hos­pi­tals as au­tumn ap­proaches.</p>
    <p>The Sante Publique France health agency, which has warned of “ex­po­nen­tial” caseload in­creases, said last Satur­day that 53 new clus­ters had been dis­cov­ered in the pre­vi­ous 24 hours, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion to 484.</p>
    <p>Twelve more Covid-19 deaths were re­ported, for an over­all toll of 30,698 since the pan­demic flared last March.</p>
    <p>Con­cerns over in­fec­tion risks have al­ready prompted of­fi­cials to close 22 schools af­ter cases were de­tected just days af­ter stu­dents re­turned from the sum­mer break last week, and dozens of in­di­vid­ual classes have also been sus­pended.</p>
    <p>And in the south-west­ern re­gion of Avey­ron, of­fi­cials an­nounced that at a care home for the el­derly, 43 res­i­dents and 11 mem­bers of staff had tested pos­i­tive for the virus, with two el­derly peo­ple be­ing hos­pi­talised.</p>
    <p>The Coun­cil of State, France’s high­est ad­min­is­tra­tive court, mean­while, has slightly mod­i­fied or­ders re­quir­ing the wear­ing of masks in sev­eral cities in the eastern Bas-Rhin re­gion, in­clud­ing Stras­bourg, and in the south-eastern Rhone re­gion cov­er­ing Lyon.</p>
    <p>It ac­cepted health min­istry ar­gu­ments that city­wide or­ders im­pos­ing the wear­ing of masks were rea­son­able, but or­dered less re­stric­tive mea­sures in less built-up ar­eas in Bas-Rhin – as well as changes to the or­ders in Rhone to al­low for the prac­tice of sports.</p>
