    <p>The gov­ern­ment has passed laws and even won a cru­cial Budget 2021 vote de­spite a frac­tious 10 months in power.</p>
    <p>But Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin, who is pres­i­dent of one of the four par­ties that made up the Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) coali­tion which forced Malaysia’s first ever change of gov­ern­ment at the 2018 elec­tion, has been un­able to shake off ac­cu­sa­tions that he is now lead­ing a “back­door gov­ern­ment”.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause the ma­jor­ity of MPs in his cur­rent rul­ing al­liance are mem­bers of the Barisan Na­sional (BN) coali­tion which lost the elec­tion in 2018 af­ter more than 60 years in power.</p>
    <p>Although per­fectly le­gal and con­sti­tu­tional, the re­align­ment of loy­al­ties in Fe­bru­ary’s so-called Sher­a­ton Move saw par­ties from the van­quished Umno-led BN find their way back to power just 22 months af­ter their de­feat, with Tan Sri Muhyid­din sworn into of­fice even­tu­ally on March 1.</p>
    <p>It is un­clear when the phrase “back­door gov­ern­ment” was first used to re­fer to what would be­come the Perikatan Na­sional (PN) rul­ing pact.</p>
    <p>But one PH leader used it as early as Feb 23 when lead­ers of sev­eral par­ties gath­ered at the Sher­a­ton Ho­tel just out­side Kuala Lumpur to block the promised trans­fer of power in PH to Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat (PKR) chief An­war Ibrahim.</p>
    <p>Mr Nga Kor Ming, Perak chief of the Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party (DAP) – the largest party in PH – had posted on Twit­ter that “any ‘back­door gov­ern­ment’ with­out man­date from the peo­ple is a be­trayal to the coun­try and the peo­ple”.</p>
    <p>Civil so­ci­ety and PH lead­ers, in­clud­ing ousted for­mer premier Ma­hathir Mo­hamad, would con­tinue to re­peat this claim, es­pe­cially as Mr Muhyid­din’s as­cen­sion was a con­tro­ver­sial one.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the new premier was ap­pointed, the King in­ter­viewed all MPs but no leader se­cured an out­right ma­jor­ity. In­stead, sev­eral party pres­i­dents pledged their sup­port for Mr Muhyid­din, de­spite Tun Dr Ma­hathir also claim­ing that 115 out of the 222 MPs in Par­lia­ment backed him.</p>
    <p>De­trac­tors then pressed the newly ap­pointed premier to prove his ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment. In­stead, the Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia pres­i­dent post­poned a sit­ting sched­uled for March 9 to May 18. Even then, the House was ad­journed un­til July im­me­di­ately af­ter the King’s open­ing speech.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din him­self ac­knowl­edged on March 27 that “this gov­ern­ment may not be the gov­ern­ment that you voted for”, but then added, when an­nounc­ing mea­sures to ad­dress the Covid-19 pan­demic, that the gov­ern­ment “cares for you”.</p>
    <p>The hand­ful of no con­fi­dence mo­tions on Par­lia­ment’s agenda in May has since grown to about two dozen to­day, all of which have not been tabled with the Premier cur­rently sad­dled with the slimmest ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment in Malaysian his­tory, of 111 out of 220 MPs. Two seats are va­cant be­cause the MPs died.</p>
    <p>Although Mr Muhyid­din – as well as his largest ally Umno – talk up the pos­si­bil­ity of a snap elec­tion the mo­ment Covid-19 is un­der con­trol, only a few par­ties have for­mally signed up to the reg­is­tered PN coali­tion, and they are nowhere near fi­nal­is­ing al­lo­ca­tions for the 222 par­lia­men­tary and 600 state wards for the next gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Per­haps, this in­sta­bil­ity, as much as the shock Fe­bru­ary coup, is why the “back­door” moniker sticks. That PN is, in fact, a loose group of par­ties cob­bled to­gether makes the Muhyid­din ad­min­is­tra­tion seem more a mar­riage of con­ve­nience, rather than a coali­tion with any pol­icy blue­print based on ide­ol­ogy.</p>
    <p>While sev­eral state gov­ern­ments were re­placed as a di­rect con­se­quence of the Sher­a­ton Move, the fact that sev­eral more were top­pled be­cause of de­fec­tions has helped resur­face the “back­door” phrase.</p>
    <p>Worse, PN could not agree on a new chief min­is­ter in Sabah for weeks af­ter fresh polls were held to solve an im­passe in Septem­ber. Umno even co-opted PH as­sem­bly­men to oust Ber­satu deputy pres­i­dent Faizal Azumu in Perak this month.</p>
    <p>Cut­ting the Gor­dian knot with an early gen­eral elec­tion might even not throw up a de­ci­sive re­sult as a po­ten­tial PN ver­sus BN ver­sus PH bat­tle could re­sult in a hung Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>No one in Malaysia can truth­fully say they can see be­yond the next 12 months, or even six, given that Covid-19 vac­cines are al­ready be­ing rolled out. This Christ­mas and New Year, many will en­thu­si­as­ti­cally wave good­bye to the night­mare that was 2020, but, at best, it will be with cau­tious op­ti­mism for the new year.</p>
    <p>One never knows what sur­prises may be on the way through the back­door.</p>
