    <p>Nvidia will buy Bri­tish chip de­signer Arm from Ja­pan’s SoftBank Group for as much as US$40 bil­lion (S$55 bil­lion), the com­pa­nies said yes­ter­day, in a deal set to re­shape the global semi­con­duc­tor sec­tor. Within hours of the an­nounce­ment, crit­ics ques­tioned how Arm would main­tain its open ap­proach un­der US own­er­ship and at a time of fric­tion with China.</p>
    <p>Nvidia is buy­ing up tech­nolo­gies in parts of the boom­ing data cen­tre busi­ness where it does not cur­rently play. In April, it com­pleted the pur­chase of Is­rael-based Mel­lanox, which makes high-speed net­work­ing tech­nol­ogy that is used in data cen­tres and su­per­com­put­ers.</p>
    <p>• Nvidia will buy Bri­tish­based chip de­signer Arm from Ja­pan’s SoftBank Group for as much as US$40 bil­lion (S$54.7 bil­lion), the com­pa­nies said yes­ter­day, in a deal set to re­shape the global semi­con­duc­tor sec­tor.</p>
    <p>The sale puts a vi­tal sup­plier to Ap­ple and oth­ers across the in­dus­try un­der the con­trol of a sin­gle player and faces likely push­back from reg­u­la­tors and ri­vals to Nvidia, the big­gest US chip com­pany by mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Within hours of the an­nounce­ment, crit­ics ques­tioned how Arm would main­tain its open ap­proach un­der US own­er­ship and at a time of fric­tion with China.</p>
    <p>Nvidia chief ex­ec­u­tive Jensen Huang em­pha­sised that Arm would re­tain its neu­tral li­cens­ing model and ex­pand it by li­cens­ing out Nvidia in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty for the first time. “We want to grow Arm and make it be­come even greater,” he told an­a­lysts on a con­fer­ence call.</p>
    <p>For SoftBank, the sale marks an early exit from Arm, which it ac­quired for US$32 bil­lion. Chief ex­ec­u­tive Masayoshi Son has li­onised the po­ten­tial of Arm but is slash­ing his stakes in ma­jor as­sets to raise cash.</p>
    <p>It comes as SoftBank ex­ec­u­tives, frus­trated at the group’s stock per­for­mance, have held early-stage talks about tak­ing the Ja­panese tech­nol­ogy group pri­vate, a source told Reuters. Those talks could gain mo­men­tum fol­low­ing the Arm sale. SoftBank’s shares soared 10 per cent in Tokyo.</p>
    <p>Nvidia will pay SoftBank US$21.5 bil­lion in shares and US$12 bil­lion in cash, in­clud­ing US$2 bil­lion on sign­ing. The deal will see SoftBank and its US$100 bil­lion Vi­sion Fund, which has a 25 per cent stake in Arm, take a stake in Nvidia of be­tween 6.7 per cent and 8.1 per cent.</p>
    <p>Nvidia will li­cense its flag­ship graph­i­cal pro­ces­sor unit through Arm’s net­work of sil­i­con part­ners.</p>
    <p>It will build chips for de­vices like self-driv­ing cars but also make its tech­nol­ogy avail­able for oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan-born Huang has promised to site a new ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence re­search cen­tre – equipped with its own su­per­com­puter – at Arm’s base in the univer­sity city of Cam­bridge, and said the com­pany was ready to talk to the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment about ex­pand­ing Arm’s re­search ef­forts.</p>
    <p>He stopped short of of­fer­ing fresh job guar­an­tees, how­ever.</p>
    <p>Arm does not make chips but has cre­ated an in­struc­tion set ar­chi­tec­ture – the most fun­da­men­tal in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty that un­der­pins com­put­ing chips – on which it bases de­signs for com­put­ing cores.</p>
    <p>It li­censes its chip de­signs and tech to cus­tomers like Qual­comm, Ap­ple and Sam­sung Elec­tron­ics. Ap­ple’s forth­com­ing Mac com­put­ers will use Arm-based chips.</p>
    <p>Arm will not be­come sub­ject to US ex­port con­trols un­der the deal, said Mr Huang.</p>
    <p>The pur­chase, which is sub­ject to reg­u­la­tory ap­provals, in­clud­ing in Britain, the United States and China, is likely to come un­der close scru­tiny in China, where thou­sands of com­pa­nies from Huawei to small start-ups use Arm tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Nvidia will take con­trol of the mi­nor­ity stake in joint ven­ture Arm China. Arm is in dis­pute with the ven­ture, which li­censes chip ar­chi­tec­ture to lo­cal com­pa­nies, over its man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>The Arm ac­qui­si­tion will put Nvidia into even more in­tense com­pe­ti­tion with ri­vals in the data cen­tre chip mar­ket such as In­tel and Ad­vanced Mi­cro De­vices be­cause Arm has been de­vel­op­ing tech­nol­ogy to com­pete with their chips.</p>
    <p>In a pos­si­ble di­rect chal­lenge to those ri­vals, Mr Huang said it is “pos­si­ble” Nvidia will build its own server chips based on Arm de­signs.</p>
    <p>Nvidia is buy­ing up tech­nolo­gies in parts of the boom­ing data cen­tre busi­ness where it does not cur­rently play. In April, it com­pleted the pur­chase of Is­rael-based Mel­lanox, which makes high-speed net­work­ing tech­nol­ogy that is used in data cen­tres and su­per­com­put­ers.</p>
    <p>The Arm deal is ex­pected to close by March 2022. SoftBank could be paid an ad­di­tional US$5 bil­lion in cash or shares, de­pend­ing on the chip de­signer’s busi­ness per­for­mance, with Arm em­ploy­ees to be paid US$1.5 bil­lion in Nvidia shares.</p>
