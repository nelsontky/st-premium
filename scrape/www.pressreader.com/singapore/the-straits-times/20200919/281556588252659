    <p>1 Big Thai protest planned</p>
    <p>Thai protest lead­ers said that they ex­pected as many as 100,000 peo­ple to at­tend to­day’s anti-gov­ern­ment demon­stra­tion in Bangkok, and vowed to re­it­er­ate calls for re­forms of the monar­chy. Demon­stra­tors have since mid-July been de­mand­ing the re­moval of Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha and changes to the Con­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>BANGKOK Thai protest lead­ers said yes­ter­day that they ex­pected the big­gest anti-gov­ern­ment demon­stra­tion in years this week­end, and vowed to re­it­er­ate their calls for re­forms of the monar­chy de­spite of­fi­cial pres­sure to stop.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers have, since the mid­dle of July, been de­mand­ing the re­moval of Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha, a for­mer junta leader, and changes to a Con­sti­tu­tion that they say was de­signed to ex­tend military dom­i­na­tion of pol­i­tics af­ter a gen­eral elec­tion last year.</p>
    <p>Some pro­test­ers have also called for un­prece­dented re­forms of the monar­chy, pre­vi­ously a taboo sub­ject in Thai­land.</p>
    <p>To­day’s “rally will make his­tory and will be the big­gest one since the 2014 coup”, said Mr Parit “Pen­guin” Chi­warak, one of the protest lead­ers, adding that he be­lieved up to 100,000 peo­ple could show up.</p>
    <p>Po­lice said they ex­pected up to 50,000 to join the protest.</p>
    <p>Thai pol­i­tics has for years been marked by chal­lenges to the roy­al­ist, military estab­lish­ment by politi­cians backed by poor ur­ban and ru­ral vot­ers, and more re­cently by the stu­dent pro­test­ers.</p>
    <p>The military, which pro­claims it­self the de­fender of the coun­try’s core in­sti­tu­tions, in par­tic­u­lar the monar­chy, has stepped in to over­throw civil­ian gov­ern­ments numer­ous times, most re­cently in 2014, cit­ing the need to main­tain sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Tens of thou­sands of pro­test­ers are due to gather to­day at Bangkok’s Tham­masat Univer­sity and march to the prime min­is­ter’s of­fices, known as Gov­ern­ment House, to­mor­row to put pres­sure on Mr Prayut.</p>
    <p>A group of pro­test­ers from the univer­sity last month staged a rally at which a 10-point de­mand for re­form of the monar­chy was read out, in­clud­ing a call for the abo­li­tion of a law against royal crit­i­cism.</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut has said the gov­ern­ment would al­low protests as a form of free speech, but that de­mands for re­form of the monar­chy were not ac­cept­able.</p>
    <p>Mr Parit said the de­mands would be re­it­er­ated this week­end.</p>
    <p>Tham­masat Univer­sity said last week that it would not al­low the gath­er­ing on its cam­pus, but pro­test­ers said they were stick­ing to their plan.</p>
    <p>They will also use nearby Sanam Luang, a large open space in front of the Grand Palace.</p>
    <p>Po­lice said march­ing to Gov­ern­ment House could break a law pro­hibit­ing large gath­er­ings near re­stricted sites.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, Mr Prayut warned the pro­test­ers against rais­ing the risks of spread­ing the coro­n­avirus and urged them to put the health cri­sis be­fore pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, many film­go­ers in Thai­land are choos­ing to sit when the royal an­them is played be­fore cin­ema screen­ings, the South China Morn­ing Post re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The an­them is played along­side a video mon­tage cel­e­brat­ing the life of King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong news­pa­per said this week that a Thai-lan­guage hash­tag trans­lat­ing to “don’t stand in the cin­ema” was shared more than 52,000 times.</p>
    <p>“I don’t stand. I don’t want to, it’s not nec­es­sary, I don’t care,” wrote one Face­book user, as quoted by the news­pa­per.</p>
