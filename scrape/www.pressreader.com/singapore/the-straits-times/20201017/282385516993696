    <p>• Manch­ester City’s Kevin de Bruyne will miss to­day’s home Pre­mier League game against Ar­se­nal af­ter pick­ing up an in­jury on in­ter­na­tional duty with Bel­gium last week­end, man­ager Pep Guardi­ola said.</p>
    <p>The mid­fielder was sub­sti­tuted in the sec­ond half of Bel­gium’s 2-1 Na­tions League de­feat by Eng­land at Wem­b­ley last Sun­day and then with­drew from the na­tional squad with an un­spec­i­fied in­jury.</p>
    <p>“The squad have come back a lit­tle bet­ter than the pre­vi­ous time. Un­for­tu­nately Kevin is out but the rest of the play­ers came back well,” Guardi­ola told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think it’s much but the next games I think he will be out. We will see day by day how he is.”</p>
    <p>City have a busy fix­ture list, host­ing Porto in the Cham­pi­ons League group stage on Wed­nes­day be­fore a league trip to West Ham the fol­low­ing Saturday. They then travel to Mar­seille for another group­stage game the Tues­day af­ter.</p>
    <p>Guardi­ola had bet­ter news on striker Ser­gio Aguero, City’s record scorer, af­ter the Ar­gen­tinian re­turned to train­ing fol­low­ing a knee in­jury in June.</p>
    <p>“Ser­gio is train­ing well and I’m so happy to see him on the pitch af­ter such a long t i me , ” s a i d the Spa­niard. “Ev­ery team needs a striker and we have played with­out them the last two, three games.”</p>
    <p>Gabriel Je­sus still has a mus­cle in­jury and Guardi­ola said he did not know when the striker might re­turn.</p>
    <p>To­day’s match is another clash between Guardi­ola, whose side have taken only four points from their first three matches, and his for­mer as­sis­tant Mikel Arteta. But the City boss ques­tioned any “master and ap­pren­tice” head­lines.</p>
    <p>“Maybe we should clar­ify who’s the master and who’s the ap­pren­tice first,” he said. “He set­tled re­ally well and the way his team is play­ing right now is per­fect for the qual­ity they have.”</p>
    <p>Arteta is hop­ing to have de­fender Kieran Tier­ney avail­able as dis­cus­sions over his need to self-iso­late con­tinue. Tier­ney and Ryan Christie were told to quar­an­tine for 14 days af­ter Scot­land team­mate Stu­art Arm­strong tested pos­i­tive for coro­n­avirus while on in­ter­na­tional duty. But both Tier­ney and Christie re­turned neg­a­tive tests and have in­sisted they com­plied with so­cial dis­tanc­ing guide­lines.</p>
    <p>Arteta re­fused to be drawn on whether dead­line-day sign­ing Thomas Partey will make his de­but at City, given he is yet to train with his team­mates. He also sug­gested teenage de­fender Wil­liam Sal­iba would not be de­part­ing on loan.</p>
    <p>Asked about fac­ing Guardi­ola again fol­low­ing July’s 2-0 FA Cup semi-fi­nal win over City, he said: “I know him re­ally well be­cause we worked to­gether for four years. We both know how we think.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter (that) is to try to pre­vent them ex­e­cut­ing on the foot­ball pitch when every­thing is go­ing a hun­dred miles an hour which is very dif­fi­cult, much more dif­fi­cult than just on tac­tics boards.”</p>
