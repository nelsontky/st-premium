    <p>The death of Madam Mandy Yeong due to pul­monary fat em­bolism was the sec­ond fa­tal­ity in Sin­ga­pore aris­ing from a neg­li­gent liposuctio­n pro­ce­dure.</p>
    <p>In De­cem­ber 2009, Mr Franklin Heng, chief ex­ec­u­tive of YTL Starhill Global Reit Man­age­ment, died af­ter he was given too much anaes­the­sia dur­ing a liposuctio­n pro­ce­dure.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng, who was 44 at the time, suf­fo­cated when his air­way col­lapsed be­cause of the heavy se­da­tion.</p>
    <p>Es­tate trustees sued the two doc­tors and the clinic re­spon­si­ble on be­half of his fam­ily. In May 2015, his fam­ily was awarded $5.3 mil­lion by Jus­tice Choo Han Teck.</p>
    <p>The sum in­cluded $3.88 mil­lion to make up for the loss of in­her­i­tance his de­pen­dants suf­fered. In Septem­ber 2016, the Court of Ap­peal re­duced the pay­out from $5.3 mil­lion to $3.2 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>In Novem­ber 2018, a Court of Three Judges or­dered one doc­tor, Wong Meng Hang, to be struck off the register, and the other, Zhu Xiu Chun, to be sus­pended for 18 months. The court also called for the duo to be in­ves­ti­gated for pos­si­ble crim­i­nal of­fences.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary this year, Wong was charged with caus­ing Mr Heng’s death through a rash act, while Zhu was charged with abet­ting him.</p>
