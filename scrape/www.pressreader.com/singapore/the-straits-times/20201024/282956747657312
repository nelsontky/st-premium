    <p>What are the im­por­tant traits of an ef­fec­tive early child­hood ed­u­ca­tor?</p>
    <p>Early child­hood ed­u­ca­tors need to be pa­tient and quick to re­spond to changes, as well as have the abil­ity to think on your feet. You will play an im­por­tant role in shap­ing young minds and you are giv­ing the chil­dren beau­ti­ful mem­o­ries that they will carry through­out their en­tire life­time.</p>
    <p>What makes PCF Sparkle­tots’ teach­ing model dif­fer­ent from its com­peti­tors?</p>
    <p>At PCF Sparkle­tots, we be­lieve that chil­dren de­velop and learn through mean­ing­ful and au­then­tic ex­pe­ri­ences. We plan ac­tiv­i­ties and events, such as cel­e­brat­ing fes­ti­vals that al­low chil­dren to make mean­ing­ful con­nec­tions to their roots, to help them un­der­stand dif­fer­ent races and cul­tures. As a mother tongue lan­guage teacher, I get to en­liven the process of teach­ing the Chi­nese cul­ture and the lan­guage by sim­u­lat­ing real-life ex­pe­ri­ences in the class­room.</p>
    <p>What are some unique chal­lenges you face be­cause of Covid-19?</p>
    <p>When the chil­dren first re­turned to school af­ter the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, I was con­cerned about how they were go­ing to adapt to the safety mea­sures in place. I used sto­ry­telling and songs to help them un­der­stand why we need to have the mea­sures in place and the im­por­tance of fol­low­ing them. The chil­dren adapted well, but I still con­stantly re­mind them of the im­por­tance of hand hy­giene and other mea­sures through­out the day. I am talk­ing a lot more than usual, and while it may be tax­ing, it is cru­cial to en­sure that the chil­dren un­der my care are safe and learn­ing well.</p>
    <p>What is your ad­vice to those look­ing to fol­low in your foot­steps?</p>
    <p>It is im­por­tant for new­com­ers to find an or­gan­i­sa­tion that puts the em­ploy­ees first and en­cour­ages pro­fes­sional devel­op­ment. I am happy to have found an or­gan­i­sa­tion that ticks all the boxes.</p>
