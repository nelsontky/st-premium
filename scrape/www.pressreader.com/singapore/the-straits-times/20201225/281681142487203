    <p>2020 has been a year of up­heaval and cri­sis – one that was shaped by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. It also saw sig­nif­i­cant de­vel­op­ments, such as a gen­eral elec­tion in Sin­ga­pore, and the United States elect­ing its next leader. In this 12-day se­ries,</p>
    <p>The Straits Times spot­lights 20 words or phrases that de­fined 2020.</p>
    <p>Trav­el­ling over­seas for leisure has been a priv­i­lege that was part of many Sin­ga­pore­ans’ life­styles.</p>
    <p>But the wings of travel bugs were abruptly clipped ear­lier this year as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic shut down air travel.</p>
    <p>Coun­tries closed their borders to stem the spread of the virus, and many of th­ese re­stric­tions re­main in place as 2020 draws to a close.</p>
    <p>One way coun­tries – in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore – have tried to re­vive in­ter­na­tional travel and bat­tered tourism-linked in­dus­tries is via an air travel bub­ble, which would al­low trav­ellers from one coun­try to en­ter another for leisure with­out serv­ing quar­an­tine, pro­vided they test neg­a­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Th­ese travel bub­bles were mooted as a way to restart travel be­tween coun­tries that had Covid-19 un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>Un­der Sin­ga­pore’s in­ter­pre­ta­tion of such bub­bles, tourists and other trav­ellers will be tested for the coro­n­avirus upon ar­rival in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>They will not have to be quar­an­tined or fol­low a fixed itin­er­ary if they test neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>This goes a step be­yond ear­lier an­nounced ar­range­ments, such as re­cip­ro­cal green lanes which al­low for only of­fi­cial and es­sen­tial busi­ness travel.</p>
    <p>Ex­cite­ment about the re­sump­tion of leisure travel reached fever pitch when Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung an­nounced on Nov 11 that Sin­ga­pore­ans would be able to travel to Hong Kong for leisure from Nov 22.</p>
    <p>Tick­ets were quickly snapped up. The avi­a­tion au­thor­i­ties in both cities ea­gerly pre­pared for the launch of the bub­ble, with elab­o­rate wel­come cer­e­monies planned in both coun­tries.</p>
    <p>But just one day be­fore, a spike in Covid-19 cases in Hong Kong led to both cities agree­ing to a two-week de­lay to the travel ar­range­ment.</p>
    <p>That has now stretched in­def­i­nitely into the next year.</p>
    <p>But Mr Ong said this month that Sin­ga­pore will con­tinue to seek new re­gions to es­tab­lish travel bub­bles with. Po­ten­tial part­ner coun­tries in­clude those that Sin­ga­pore has uni­lat­er­ally opened its borders to, such as Aus­tralia (ex­clud­ing New South Wales) and Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>The avi­a­tion sec­tor will be hop­ing for good news on this front soon af­ter a suf­fo­cat­ing year.</p>
    <p>Changi Air­port has reg­is­tered just 11.6 mil­lion pas­sen­ger move­ments up till last month.</p>
    <p>This is 81.2 per cent lower than the 68.3 mil­lion pas­sen­ger move­ments reg­is­tered in the whole of last year.</p>
    <p>More than half of this year’s traf­fic – 5.95 mil­lion – was reg­is­tered in Jan­uary alone, be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic es­ca­lated.</p>
    <p>The low num­ber of pas­sen­gers re­sulted in the sus­pen­sion of op­er­a­tions at Changi Air­port ter­mi­nals 2 and 4. The mega Changi Air­port Ter­mi­nal 5 project, due to be com­pleted in the 2030s, was also paused for at least two years.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) Group – made up of SIA, bud­get arm Scoot and re­gional arm SilkAir – car­ried 98.1 per cent fewer pas­sen­gers last month com­pared with Novem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>The con­tin­ued sever­ity of the pan­demic meant that firms in the sec­tor have had to cut jobs in a bid to cush­ion the im­pact of the fall­ing num­ber of trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>The SIA Group said in Septem­ber that it would cut around 4,300 po­si­tions across its three air­lines.</p>
    <p>The other lo­cal car­rier, Jet­star Asia, said in June that it would cut about 180 peo­ple – 26 per cent of its work­force – with most of the re­main­ing staff stay­ing fur­loughed till the end of this year.</p>
    <p>Sig­nif­i­cant pay cuts were also in­tro­duced at SIA, Changi Air­port Group and other avi­a­tion firms.</p>
    <p>But af­ter the bleak­est of years, the lo­cal and global avi­a­tion sec­tor will likely find some re­lief next year.</p>
    <p>Pas­sen­ger num­bers are slowly pick­ing up again, af­ter hit­ting rock bot­tom in the ear­lier half of this year.</p>
    <p>The in­tro­duc­tion of vac­cines against Covid-19 has also sparked hope that there is now a clearer path to re­cov­ery for air travel.</p>
    <p>The air travel in­dus­try has used this pe­riod to im­prove its of­fer­ings in prepa­ra­tion for post-pan­demic travel, with con­tact­less jour­neys now pos­si­ble and tech­nol­ogy for vac­cine pass­ports in the works.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic has shown that it re­mains sup­port­ive of the lo­cal air hub even amid time away from the skies.</p>
    <p>One-off of­fer­ings by SIA, such as a din­ing ex­pe­ri­ence on board its grounded Air­bus A-380 planes, as well as tours of its train­ing school, were very well re­ceived.</p>
    <p>The road to re­cov­ery will be long and ar­du­ous for the air travel in­dus­try, with the In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion pre­dict­ing that air pas­sen­ger traf­fic will fully re­cover only by 2024.</p>
    <p>But as Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said in an ad­dress to Par­lia­ment in Septem­ber, the avi­a­tion sec­tor will take flight again.</p>
    <p>He said: “Do not doubt. Do not fear. Jewel will shine again. Changi will thrive again. SIA will be a great way to fly once more.”</p>
