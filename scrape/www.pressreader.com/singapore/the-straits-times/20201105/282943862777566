    <p>Amer­i­can ac­tor Har­ri­son Ford has paid trib­ute to his on-screen fa­ther – the late Scot­tish ac­tor Sean Con­nery, who died aged 90 last week in the Ba­hamas.</p>
    <p>Ford mourned the loss in a state­ment to en­ter­tain­ment pub­li­ca­tion Va­ri­ety.</p>
    <p>The 78-year-old star wrote: “He was my fa­ther... not in life... but in Indy 3. You don’t know plea­sure un­til some­one pays you to take Sean Con­nery for a ride in the side car of a Rus­sian mo­tor­cy­cle bounc­ing along a bumpy, twisty moun­tain trail and get­ting to watch him squirm.</p>
    <p>“We had fun. If he’s in heaven, I hope they have golf cour­ses. Rest in peace, dear friend.”</p>
    <p>Con­nery played Ford’s fa­ther in In­di­ana Jones And The Last Cru­sade (1989) – the third film in the In­di­ana Jones film fran­chise (1981 to 2008), in which the lat­ter took on the tit­u­lar role.</p>
    <p>Con­nery is beloved as the first ac­tor to play the fic­tional Bri­tish se­cret ser­vice agent James Bond. He was the first to ut­ter the char­ac­ter’s now fa­mous catch­phrase, “The name’s Bond... James Bond”, on the big screen.</p>
    <p>Ge­orge Lu­cas, the screen ti­tan who cre­ated the In­di­ana Jones fran­chise, also hon­oured the late ac­tor.</p>
    <p>He said in a state­ment: “He will al­ways hold a spe­cial place in my heart as Indy’s dad. With an air of in­tel­li­gent au­thor­ity and sly sense of comedic mischief, only some­one like Sean Con­nery could ren­der In­di­ana Jones im­me­di­ately into boy­ish re­gret or re­lief through a stern fa­therly chid­ing or re­joice­ful hug.”</p>
    <p>Con­nery’s death and his sev­en­decade ca­reer has led to an out­pour­ing of trib­utes, in­clud­ing from ac­tor Daniel Craig, the cur­rent James Bond.</p>
    <p>Craig said: “He de­fined an era and a style... He helped cre­ate the modern block­buster.”</p>
    <p>Con­nery, who largely re­tired from act­ing in 2006, suf­fered from de­men­tia in his later years.</p>
