    <p>LON­DON • An un­fa­mil­iar course, poor weather and the ab­sence of 750,000 cheer­ing fans sug­gest a world record is un­likely in Sun­day’s Lon­don Marathon but long­stand­ing ri­vals Eliud Kip­choge and Ke­nenisa Bekele could still pro­duce a race for the ages.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the can­cel­la­tion of the orig­i­nal race, ini­tially set for April, due to Covid-19, or­gan­is­ers have pulled to­gether an elite-only event, fea­tur­ing al­most 20 laps of St James’ Park, be­hind high fences and watched only by a hand­ful of jour­nal­ists, coaches and event of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>Run­ners are re­quired to take a coro­n­avirus test be­fore they leave for Lon­don and when they ar­rive. They will be stay­ing at an ath­le­teonly ho­tel, and will be tested again to­day be­fore the event on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>For Kenya’s Kip­choge, the change in route will feel fa­mil­iar af­ter he be­came the first man to break two hours on a sim­i­lar mul­ti­lap course in Vi­enna last year, but his 1hr 59min 40sec time was ruled un­of­fi­cial due to pace­maker and drink sta­tion anom­alies.</p>
    <p>There is no get­ting around his of­fi­cial record, how­ever, posted 2:01.39 in Ber­lin in 2018.</p>
    <p>Ethiopia’s Bekele had won mul­ti­ple world and Olympic track ti­tles, set­ting long­stand­ing world records along the way.</p>
    <p>But his marathon best seemed to be be­hind him un­til he some­how set a 2:01.41 time in Ber­lin last year to miss Kip­choge’s mark by two sec­onds, mak­ing the duo the only men to have bro­ken 2hr 2min for the dis­tance.</p>
    <p>It is re­mark­able that both won dis­tance world ti­tles in 2003 and now, 17 years on, are still break­ing new ground.</p>
    <p>Bekele, who still holds the 10,000m world record al­though he lost his 5,000m mark last month, is 38 years old, while Kip­choge is three years younger.</p>
    <p>“It should be a great race and I’m re­ally look­ing for­ward to it af­ter al­most a year since I last com­peted,” said Kip­choge, who is seek­ing a record fifth Lon­don ti­tle.</p>
    <p>“It’s (world record) not an easy thing. It’s a long way and maybe at some point, you’re los­ing some speed be­cause of the curve. I don’t know how curved it is, we will see.”</p>
    <p>Bekele agreed that break­ing the mark would be tough, adding: “It’s a new course. At this mo­ment, it’s re­ally dif­fi­cult to say if it’s a re­ally fast course or not.”</p>
    <p>Both run­ners also ad­mit­ted the race would have a dif­fer­ent feel without fans lin­ing the route.</p>
    <p>“Crowds plays a mas­sive role, es­pe­cially in marathons,” said Kip­choge. “Sun­day will be a dif­fer­ent race whereby it will be a silent feel.”</p>
    <p>Kip­choge will wear the lat­est ver­sion of Nike’s car­bon-plated Al­phafly Next% shoe, which com­ply with World Ath­let­ics’ new re­stric­tions on cush­ion­ing height but are still per­ceived to give a con­sid­er­able ad­van­tage over tra­di­tional shoes.</p>
    <p>Bekele has opted for the older Va­por­fly ver­sion that served him so well last year.</p>
