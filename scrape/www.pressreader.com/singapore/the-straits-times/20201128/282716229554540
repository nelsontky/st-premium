    <p>All Blacks skip­per Sam Cane yes­ter­day said his team have an ex­tra “edge” about them head­ing into their crunch clash with Ar­gentina, driven by the “hor­ri­ble” feel­ing of two straight de­feats.</p>
    <p>New Zealand are in the rare sit­u­a­tion of try­ing to avoid three losses in a row, a fate they have not suf­fered since 1998.</p>
    <p>Stand­ing in their way in New­cas­tle to­day is an Argentinia­n side who not only beat them 25-15 in the Tri Na­tions this month, but fol­lowed it up with a bat­tling draw against Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Cane ad­mit­ted suf­fer­ing two Test de­feats in a row – they also lost to the Wal­la­bies – and a back­lash from their no­to­ri­ously de­mand­ing fans had left them rat­tled.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one in the squad is hurt­ing and there is an op­por­tu­nity to try and right some wrongs, and put some pride back in the All Blacks jer­sey,” he said.</p>
    <p>“There is a slightly dif­fer­ent mood. The eas­i­est way to ex­plain it is there is a bit of an edge, al­most a grumpi­ness through­out the week.</p>
    <p>“Some­times (in train­ing), it’s good to have a bit of fun, but we are so fo­cused and have just wanted to get the most out of ev­ery train­ing session this week to give our­selves the best chance of play­ing well.”</p>
    <p>Much of the flak from the backto-back de­feats had been di­rected at coach Ian Fos­ter, al­though Cane had also been un­der scru­tiny for his lead­er­ship skills.</p>
    <p>He in­sisted his head had been “in a good place” this week with “tremen­dous sup­port” from his team­mates.</p>
    <p>“We are very fo­cused on what we can con­trol and in try­ing to get a good per­for­mance, and sort of block­ing out any out­side noise,” the loose for­ward said.</p>
    <p>“We’re em­brac­ing the pres­sure we’re un­der but us­ing that in a pos­i­tive way to drive us... We’re driven to try and put a per­for­mance to­gether that we’re proud of.”</p>
    <p>He added that his team would keep their emo­tions i n check against a Pu­mas side who could be ex­tra mo­ti­vated fol­low­ing the death of Ar­gentina foot­ball leg­end Diego Maradona ear­lier this week.</p>
    <p>“Know­ing the Argentinia­n peo­ple, from my limited ex­pe­ri­ence I am sure he was viewed as a God­like fig­ure,” he said. “I’m sure that will be a big driv­ing fac­tor for them.”</p>
    <p>Fos­ter has reshuf­fled his for­wards to bet­ter tackle the phys­i­cal­ity of Ar­gentina, bring­ing in prop Nepo Laulala for Tyrel Lo­max, lock Scott Barrett ahead of Pa­trick Tuip­u­lotu and l oose for­ward Akira Ioane in­stead of Shan­non Frizell.</p>
