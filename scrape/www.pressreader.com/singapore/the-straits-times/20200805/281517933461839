    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has re­peat­edly in­sisted that any sale of TikTok’s US op­er­a­tions would have to in­clude a sub­stan­tial pay­ment to the United States – but it was not clear un­der what au­thor­ity he can ex­tract a pay­out.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier on Mon­day, Mr Trump said TikTok will have to close in the US by Sept 15 – un­less there is a deal to sell the so­cial net­work’s do­mes­tic op­er­a­tions to Mi­crosoft or an­other US com­pany.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhang Yim­ing, the founder of ByteDance, which owns TikTok, said the US gov­ern­ment did not aim to force the sale of TikTok, but rather wanted to ban it. While a forced sale of TikTok to a US buyer is “un­rea­son­able”, the com­pany has no choice but to abide by the law, he said.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has leapt to TikTok’s de­fence, ac­cus­ing the US of “out­right bul­ly­ing”.</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said TikTok will have to close in the US by Sept 15 – un­less there is a deal to sell the so­cial net­work’s do­mes­tic op­er­a­tions to Mi­crosoft or an­other Amer­i­can firm.</p>
    <p>He also said the fed­eral gov­ern­ment will have to be paid an amount equal to a per­cent­age of the deal, “whether it’s Mi­crosoft or some­body else or it was Chi­nese”. But it was not clear un­der what au­thor­ity he can ex­tract a pay­out.</p>
    <p>It would be un­prece­dented, based on re­cent his­tory, for the US gov­ern­ment to col­lect a cut of a trans­ac­tion in­volv­ing com­pa­nies in which it does not hold a stake.</p>
    <p>“The United States should get a very large per­cent­age of that price, be­cause we’re making it pos­si­ble,” Mr Trump told re­porters at a news con­fer­ence on Mon­day evening.</p>
    <p>“What­ever the num­ber is, it would come from the sale, which no­body else would be think­ing out but me, but that’s the way I think. And I think it’s very fair,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump set off a fu­ri­ous scram­ble over the fate of the Chi­ne­se­owned app last Fri­day, when he said he would ban the com­pany’s op­er­a­tions through an ex­ec­u­tive ac­tion the next day. But the week­end passed with­out any of­fi­cial move from the White House, af­ter Mr Trump spoke with Mi­crosoft chief ex­ec­u­tive Satya Nadella about his com­pany’s ef­forts to pur­chase the vi­ral video ap­pli­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Mi­crosoft said in a blog post that it was aim­ing to com­plete a deal for TikTok’s op­er­a­tions in the US, as well as in Canada, Aus­tralia and</p>
    <p>New Zealand, no later than Sept 15.</p>
    <p>The White House had in­sisted on that dead­line, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>It could prove an up­hill climb, with key de­tails for the deal – in­clud­ing price – still not worked out, peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the dis­cus­sions said.</p>
    <p>Mi­crosoft’s blog post also said it is com­mit­ted to “pro­vid­ing proper eco­nomic ben­e­fits to the United States, in­clud­ing the United States Trea­sury”.</p>
    <p>That lan­guage re­ferred to tax rev­enue and job creation, ac­cord­ing to a per­son fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter – rather than some sort of special trans­ac­tion fee.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump com­pared the ar­range­ment to land­lord-ten­ant dy­nam­ics.</p>
    <p>“With­out the lease, the ten­ant doesn’t have the value,” he said. “Well, we’re sort of in a cer­tain way the lease. We make it pos­si­ble to have this great suc­cess.”</p>
    <p>The US as­sesses fees as­so­ci­ated with deals un­der re­view by the Com­mit­tee on For­eign In­vest­ment in the US, or CFIUS, which in­ves­ti­gates over­seas ac­qui­si­tions of Amer­i­can busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>But those charges – set on a slid­ing scale and go­ing no higher than US$300,000 (S$413,000) – did not fit what Mr Trump de­scribed.</p>
    <p>CFIUS has been re­view­ing ByteDance’s 2017 pur­chase of the lip-synch­ing app Mu­si­cal.ly that was later folded into TikTok.</p>
    <p>The White House has said it is con­cerned that ByteDance could be com­pelled to hand over Amer­i­can users’ data to Bei­jing or use the app to in­flu­ence the 165 mil­lion Amer­i­cans, and more than 2 bil­lion users glob­ally, who have down­loaded it.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has looked to ratchet up pres­sure on China ahead of Novem­ber’s pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, frus­trated by slow im­ple­men­ta­tion of the trade pact inked ear­lier this year and the spread of the coro­n­avirus for which he blames China.</p>
    <p>By go­ing af­ter TikTok, Wash­ing­ton is ex­pand­ing a fight against Bei­jing us­ing Chi­nese-style re­stric­tions on tech com­pa­nies in a move that could po­ten­tially have enor­mous ram­i­fi­ca­tions for the world’s big­gest economies.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s threat to ban ByteDance’s vi­ral teen phe­nom­e­non and other Chi­ne­se­owned apps could sig­nif­i­cantly ham­per their ac­cess to global user data, which is an im­mensely valu­able re­source in a mod­ern In­ter­net econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“This sets a dan­ger­ous prece­dent for the US,” said Ms Samm Sacks, a fel­low on cy­ber-se­cu­rity pol­icy and China dig­i­tal econ­omy at the New Amer­ica think-tank.</p>
    <p>“We are mov­ing down a path of techno-na­tion­al­ism.”</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton’s moves un­der­score how quickly the con­cept of an In­ter­net de­cou­pling is be­com­ing a re­al­ity, even as the world is still fig­ur­ing out its con­se­quences.</p>
