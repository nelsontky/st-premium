    <p>• From the out­side, Ja­panese ac­tress Yuko Takeuchi seemed to have a golden life.</p>
    <p>She had won Ja­pan’s top act­ing award three times and had re­cently given birth to her sec­ond child. She also ap­peared i n a box-of­fice favourite last year and ad­ver­tise­ments for a top ra­men brand.</p>
    <p>Takeuchi, 40, died late month, ap­par­ently in a sui­cide.</p>
    <p>No one can fully know what pri­vate tor­ment lurked be­neath the sur­face, but in a Ja­panese so­ci­ety that val­ues “gaman” – en­durance or self-de­nial – many feel pres­sure to hide their per­sonal strug­gles. The bur­den is com­pounded for celebri­ties, whose pro­fes­sional suc­cess de­pends on pro­ject­ing a flawless ideal.</p>
    <p>Takeuchi is the lat­est Ja­panese film and tele­vi­sion star to die by sui­cide this year.</p>
    <p>Her death came less than two weeks af­ter the sui­cide of ac­tress Sei Ashina, 36, and two months af­ter Haruma Miura, 30, a pop­u­lar tele­vi­sion ac­tor, was found dead in his home, leav­ing a sui­cide note.</p>
    <p>In May this year, Hana Kimura, a 22-year-old pro­fes­sional wrestler and star of re­al­ity show Ter­race House, took her own life af­ter re­lent­less bul­ly­ing on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Aside from Kimura, none of the other celebri­ties who died in sui­cides had shown pub­lic signs of emo­tional dis­tress. last</p>
    <p>Their deaths have been echoed by an alarm­ing rise in the sui­cide rates within Ja­pan’s pub­lic dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, af­ter a decade of hard-won de­cline from some of the high­est such rates in the world.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties re­ported a nearly 16 per cent in­crease in sui­cides in Au­gust com­pared with a year ear­lier, with the num­ber spik­ing by 74 per cent among teenage girls and women in their 20s and 30s.</p>
    <p>“As a so­ci­ety, we feel like we can­not show our weak­nesses, that we must hold all of it in,” said Mr Yasuyuki Shimizu, di­rec­tor of the Ja­pan Sui­cide Coun­ter­mea­sures Pro­mo­tion Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>“It’s not just that peo­ple feel like they can’t go to a coun­sel­lor or a ther­a­pist, but many feel like they can­not even show their weak­nesses to the peo­ple they are close to.”</p>
    <p>The rea­sons for sui­cide are com­plex. Many of the strains felt by the Ja­panese are uni­ver­sal: They, like many oth­ers, feel the ruth­less de­mands of so­cial me­dia, where peo­ple feel they must cul­ti­vate a nar­ra­tive of eter­nal suc­cess and hap­pi­ness.</p>
    <p>“This can def­i­nitely be a cause for spi­ralling into a de­pres­sion” if a per­son’s re­al­ity does not match some­one else’s cu­rated por­trait, Mr Shimizu said.</p>
    <p>Even away from so­cial me­dia, the</p>
    <p>Ja­panese tend to project a pos­i­tive pub­lic front. There is a strict di­vi­sion be­tween “uchi” (the home or in­side) and “soto” (out­side), with emo­tions – par­tic­u­larly messy ones – restricted to the pri­vate sphere.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple also feel they must con­form to rules and not stand out in ways that could be per­ceived as bur­den­ing oth­ers.</p>
    <p>For celebri­ties, nor­mal so­ci­etal pres­sures can be mag­ni­fied by the ex­pec­ta­tions of mil­lions of fans.</p>
    <p>And un­like in the United States, where celebri­ties now talk more openly about seek­ing psy­cho­log­i­cal help, such be­hav­iour is largely taboo in Ja­pan, which has been slower to de­velop men­tal health ser­vices, de­spite some im­prove­ment.</p>
    <p>“If you are a per­son in the spot­light and the me­dia finds out that you are re­ceiv­ing men­tal health sup­port, that would play badly for you and your ca­reer,” said Ms Ta­maki Tsuda, a TV pro­ducer.</p>
    <p>“If you go out once for men­tal ill­ness, that’s the im­age that will be tacked on to your brand for­ever. And when that hap­pens, fewer and fewer job of­fers will come in.”</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has been par­tic­u­larly tough for those in show business, as TV and film pro­duc­tion has been sus­pended or al­tered due to virus pro­tec­tion pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple in the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try lost their gigs in an in­stant when the coro­n­avirus hit, so it’s been an ex­treme blow,” Ms Tsuda said. “A lot of these ac­tors were given blank sched­ules over the past few months from their man­age­ment com­pa­nies.”</p>
    <p>At a news con­fer­ence the day af­ter Takeuchi’s death, Mr Kat­sunobu Kato, chief Cabi­net sec­re­tary to Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga, said he was con­cerned that re­ports of the celebrity sui­cides might prompt oth­ers to take their own lives.</p>
    <p>“In or­der for peo­ple not to feel iso­lated with their own wor­ries, we must work to­gether to build a so­ci­ety where we can warmly sup­port and watch over each other,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts said they were wary of vague gov­ern­ment prom­ises.</p>
    <p>“They say we should cre­ate a so­ci­ety where no­body feels lonely,” said Dr Michiko Ueda, a pro­fes­sor of po­lit­i­cal sci­ence at Waseda Univer­sity in Tokyo who has re­searched sui­cide. “But, as is typ­i­cal with any Ja­panese gov­ern­ment plan, there is no con­crete plan.”</p>
    <p>She added: “We can’t change so­ci­ety in one day.”</p>
