    <p>Sin­ga­pore is not let­ting its guard down and should be pre­pared for a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions, Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, the num­ber of coro­n­avirus cases con­tin­ues to climb, with some re­gions see­ing a resur­gence af­ter eas­ing re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>While the num­ber of com­mu­nity cases here re­mains low, care is be­ing taken to pre­vent a spike in im­ported cases. That is why those en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore with a his­tory of re­cent travel to Ja­pan, Hong Kong and the Aus­tralian state of Vic­to­ria will soon have to serve their 14-day stay­home no­tice at a ded­i­cated fa­cil­ity in­stead of their own res­i­dence.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic will do what it can to avoid a sec­ond wave, and this will en­tail vig­i­lance both at its bor­ders and within the com­mu­nity, the task force han­dling the Covid-19 out­break said dur­ing a vir­tual press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Sin­ga­pore re­ported 327 new coro­n­avirus cases, of which nine were com­mu­nity cases.</p>
    <p>Hun­dreds of for­eign work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries con­tinue to test pos­i­tive daily, but the task force said that this should no longer be the case by the mid­dle of next month, when all 323,000 such work­ers will have been cleared.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of com­mu­nity cases av­er­aged 12 per day last week, sim­i­lar to the week be­fore.</p>
    <p>That the fig­ures have re­mained sta­ble de­spite scaled-up test­ing of those show­ing symp­toms of acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion sug­gests that virus preva­lence in the com­mu­nity is low, Mr Gan said.</p>
    <p>But it is no time to be com­pla­cent as “we are cer­tainly not out of the woods yet”, he cau­tioned.</p>
    <p>Ris­ing in­fec­tions are show­ing no signs of slow­ing in coun­tries like the United States and Brazil, and the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion has re­cently warned that the sit­u­a­tion will get worse un­less there is a col­lec­tive ef­fort to con­trol the trans­mis­sion of the virus, said Mr Gan.</p>
    <p>While some, in­clud­ing China and New Zealand, have largely man­aged to bring the out­break un­der con­trol, oth­ers are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a resur­gence weeks af­ter re­lax­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, he noted.</p>
    <p>“We must be pre­pared for a sec­ond wave too. But we must do our best to avoid it, if we can.”</p>
    <p>In many coun­tries or re­gions where there had been a resur­gence, it was be­cause safe man­age­ment and safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures were not ad­hered to, Mr Gan said.</p>
    <p>In Tokyo, for ex­am­ple, more than 300 cases have been linked to nightlife es­tab­lish­ments, while in South Korea, re­li­gious gath­er­ings have led to more than 110 cases.</p>
    <p>“I know many Sin­ga­pore­ans and or­gan­i­sa­tions are keen for more flex­i­bil­ity and fur­ther re­lax­ation. But from these ex­am­ples, we know there are set­tings and ac­tiv­i­ties that are more sus­cep­ti­ble to trans­mis­sion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong also ac­knowl­edged that there may be “a fair bit of fa­tigue” with re­stric­tive mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Some eas­ing of rules, such as the num­ber of peo­ple al­lowed to gather, may be on the hori­zon if the sit­u­a­tion re­mains sta­ble, he said.</p>
    <p>At­trac­tions and ho­tels have al­ready been given the green light to re­open with safety mea­sures in place.</p>
    <p>But phase three, when events may re­sume and Sin­ga­pore en­ters a new nor­mal, will not be hap­pen­ing any time soon, Mr Wong said.</p>
    <p>Ex­am­ples from other coun­tries show how hard work to bring the out­break un­der con­trol can be un­der­mined by the lapses of a few, and lead to a ma­jor resur­gence, he said. “We would like very much to avoid this out­come.”</p>
