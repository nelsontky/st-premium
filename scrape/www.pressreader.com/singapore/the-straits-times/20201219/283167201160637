    <p>• Liver­pool boss Jur­gen Klopp was again left scratch­ing his head af­ter Pre­mier League clubs voted once more against al­low­ing five sub­sti­tutes per side in games, de­spite the con­densed sched­ule, but knows it is time to move on af­ter a third re­jec­tion.</p>
    <p>The German, who was crowned by Fifa as the Best Coach in men’s foot­ball on Thurs­day, has been a vo­cal critic of the league’s re­luc­tance to in­tro­duce the mea­sure, but ad­mit­ted de­feat in his at­tempt to get other clubs to adopt it.</p>
    <p>“I don’t want to cre­ate head­lines, ev­ery­one knows my opin­ion,” Klopp told a vir­tual press con­fer­ence ahead of to­day’s Pre­mier League trip to Crys­tal Palace. “You have to ask other peo­ple about it.</p>
    <p>“There are 10 clubs who voted against it and ev­ery­one knows who those clubs are. They voted against some­thing that was not about the com­pe­ti­tion, not about ad­van­tages, only about player wel­fare and they voted against it.</p>
    <p>“Pretty much only them voted against it i n Eu­rope, even the world, if I’m right. There must be a good rea­son for it.”</p>
    <p>Cham­pi­ons Liver­pool sit top of the Pre­mier League on 28 points de­spite hav­ing won just once away from home this sea­son, a run that in­cludes a lack­lus­tre 1-1 draw at Ful­ham last Sunday.</p>
    <p>Klopp claimed that he was not wor­ried by his side’s away form, even though he ad­mit­ted the 12th­placed Ea­gles, who drew 1-1 with Tot­ten­ham in their last game at Sel­hurst Park, will be a tough test.</p>
    <p>“It’s not that much of a con­cern, or at least we didn’t feel it,” he said. “We were slightly un­lucky as well in one or two games, I’d say. It’s a fact we didn’t win a lot away from home but we try to change that by do­ing the right things again.</p>
    <p>“Put an­other shift in, play­ing the best pos­si­ble foot­ball is the plan both away and home. I’m very im­pressed be­cause of the tal­ent of the (Palace) group.</p>
    <p>“Re­sults is one thing, but for me, it’s much more im­por­tant what kind of per­for­mance level they are ca­pa­ble of and that’s im­pres­sive.”</p>
    <p>The Reds’ in­jury cri­sis has not eased up, with eight first-team play­ers miss­ing, while the hosts can­not call on for­mer Liver­pool de­fender Ma­madou Sakho due to in­jury.</p>
