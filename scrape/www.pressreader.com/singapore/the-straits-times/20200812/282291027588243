    <p>The Galaxy Tab S7+ is one of the new de­vices un­veiled dur­ing the Sam­sung Un­packed vir­tual event on Aug 5.</p>
    <p>It is the flag­ship tablet of the Sam­sung Galaxy Tab se­ries, re­plac­ing last year’s top-tier Tab S6. The 12.4-inch tablet also has a smaller sib­ling – the 11-inch Tab S7.</p>
    <p>Apart from hav­ing a larger screen than the Tab S7, the Tab S7+ also has a larger bat­tery (a 10,090mAh unit com­pared with the Tab S7’s 8,000mAh one).</p>
    <p>It uses an on-dis­play fin­ger­print sen­sor, un­like the Tab S7, which has a fin­ger­print sen­sor on its side but­ton. The Tab S7+ comes with 5G con­nec­tiv­ity, while its smaller sib­ling has only 4G (both have Wi-Fi-only ver­sions too).</p>
    <p>Oth­er­wise, both S7 tablets share the same spec­i­fi­ca­tions, in­clud­ing a Qual­comm Snap­dragon 865 Plus pro­ces­sor, 120Hz dis­play re­fresh rate and Wi-Fi 6. Both also in­clude the same im­proved S Pen sty­lus.</p>
    <p>De­sign wise, the Tab S7+ looks sim­i­lar to the 10.5-inch Tab S6, with a sleek and pre­mium-look­ing grey metal­lic chas­sis. The Tab S7+ also re­tains its pre­de­ces­sor’s ex­cel­lent quar­tet of speak­ers.</p>
    <p>While big­ger than its pre­de­ces­sor, the Tab S7+ is still thin and light­weight, mea­sur­ing 5.7mm thick and weigh­ing 575g.</p>
    <p>The front-fac­ing cam­era is now at the top of the dis­play when the tablet is in land­scape mode – great for video-con­fer­enc­ing as you will be in the cen­tre of the frame.</p>
    <p>This also means face recog­ni­tion works bet­ter as your hand will not be block­ing the cam­era, which might hap­pen of­ten in, say, the Ap­ple iPad Pro. I find the fac­ere­cog­ni­tion fea­ture to work faster in un­lock­ing the tablet than the on-dis­play fin­ger­print sen­sor.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar to the Tab S 6, the in­cluded S Pen sty­lus can be mag­net­i­cally at­tached to the back of the tablet. The sty­lus is said to have been im­proved with de­creased la­tency.</p>
    <p>Writ­ing or draw­ing with the S Pen is as fluid as it gets – it feels like us­ing pen on pa­per.</p>
    <p>But the thing I love most about the Tab S7+ is its gor­geous Amoled dis­play. Brows­ing web­sites or just swip­ing on the screen feels smooth, thanks to the 120Hz re­fresh rate.</p>
    <p>Whether YouTube videos, high dy­namic range Net­flix shows or video games, the con­tent dis­played on the Tab S7+ looks just lovely and sharp. Games run fast too. Fur­ther­more, the built-in speak­ers of­fer su­perb stereo out­put to go with the sump­tu­ous vi­su­als.</p>
    <p>For this re­view, Sam­sung sent the op­tional Key­board Cover ($358 for Tab S7+), which con­sists of a rear cover and a front key­board cover.</p>
    <p>There ar cover in­cludes an ad­justable kick­stand and it mag­net­i­cally at­taches to the back of the tablet, while the front cover con­nects to one side of the tablet via pogo pin con­nec­tors. The rear cover also has a flap to hold the S Pen.</p>
    <p>And you will want to get this cover to turn the Tab S7+ into a lap­top. The key­board has a small but suf­fi­ciently am­ple touch­pad for you to con­trol the “mouse cur­sor”.</p>
    <p>On the down­side, the kick­stand de­sign, which is sim­i­lar to Mi­crosoft Sur­face’s, does not pro­vide much “la­pa­bil­ity” – the ease of us­ing a de­vice with it rest­ing on the lap. The key­board also lacks back­light.</p>
    <p>In terms of pro­duc­tiv­ity, the Tab S7+ shows marked im­prove­ments from its pre­de­ces­sor. It now al­lows up to three con­cur­rent sup­ported apps (pre­vi­ously only two) in split screen mode in An­droid, so you can mul­ti­task bet­ter.</p>
    <p>A new App Pair fea­ture al­lows you to com­bine three apps to launch at one go. The fea­ture is ac­ces­si­ble via the Edge screen – found in Galaxy smart­phones – which lets you quickly ac­cess your most used apps with a swipe on the dis­play’s right edge.</p>
    <p>You can also switch to Sam­sung’s DeX mode, which repli­cates the Win­dows ex­pe­ri­ence. The fea­ture works wire­lessly, so you can mir­ror the tablet to com­pat­i­ble smart TVs and mon­i­tors with­out need­ing to use a ca­ble like in the past.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the DeX mode still does not give you the pro­duc­tiv­ity of a Win­dows tablet. For in­stance, app win­dows turn small when you switch to DeX and you will have to man­u­ally re­size them af­ter­wards.</p>
    <p>Plus, you can­not use the touch­pad to highlight text in the Chrome browser in DeX mode. These are the lit­tle ir­ri­ta­tions that need to be im­proved.</p>
    <p>The Tab S7+ should eas­ily get you through a work­ing day. In The Straits Times’ video-loop bat­tery test with the dis­play set at the 120Hz re­fresh rate, it lasts 11 hours 24 min­utes.</p>
    <p>In com­par­i­son, the Tab S6 man­ages 11 hours 40 min­utes with a smaller dis­play and 60Hz re­fresh rate, though with a smaller bat­tery.</p>
    <p>The Tab S7+ is un­doubt­edly the best An­droid tablet on the mar­ket right now. But with prices start­ing at $1,598, it is not cheap. Add the Key­board Cover and you are look­ing at spend­ing about $2,000 – as good as buy­ing a lap­top.</p>
    <p>But if you pre-or­der the Tab S7+ be­fore its launch on Aug 21, you can get the Key­board Cover for free.</p>
    <p>With the lat­ter, it means you are ef­fec­tively get­ting a lap­top as well as a tablet.</p>
