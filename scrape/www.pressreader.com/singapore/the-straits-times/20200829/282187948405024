    <p>The newly up­graded Choa Chu Kang Water­works was named Wa­ter Project of the Year at the Global Wa­ter Awards 2020, said na­tional wa­ter agency PUB yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The awards recog­nise the most im­por­tant achieve­ments in the in­ter­na­tional wa­ter in­dus­try, in­clud­ing im­proved op­er­at­ing per­for­mance, in­no­va­tive tech­nol­ogy adop­tion and sus­tain­able fi­nan­cial mod­els.</p>
    <p>The other projects in the run­ning for the Wa­ter Project of the Year award were the Mon­tev­ina Wa­ter Treat­ment Plant Up­grade in the United States, Pu­tatan 2 Drink­ing Wa­ter Plant in the Philip­pines, and Tai Po Wa­ter Treat­ment Works Ex­pan­sion in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>The award is the PUB’s third con­sec­u­tive win at the pres­ti­gious an­nual Global Wa­ter Awards, es­tab­lished by pub­lisher and events or­gan­iser Global Wa­ter In­tel­li­gence since 2006.</p>
    <p>Last year, the PUB-owned Tuas De­sali­na­tion Plant won the De­sali­na­tion Plant of the Year award, while Ulu Pan­dan Waste­water Treat­ment Demon­stra­tion Plant was named Wa­ter/Waste­water Project of the Year in 2018.</p>
    <p>Built in two phases in 1975 and 1981, Choa Chu Kang Water­works is one of Sin­ga­pore’s old­est wa­ter treat­ment plants.</p>
    <p>De­spite its age, the plant houses the largest ce­ramic mem­brane sys­tem in the world, fol­low­ing an ex­ten­sive three-year up­grade that started in 2016 and cost $162 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The ce­ramic mem­brane sys­tem is more ef­fi­cient at re­mov­ing sus­pended par­ti­cles from raw wa­ter than the plant’s pre­vi­ous sand fil­tra­tion sys­tem.</p>
    <p>The plant has a ca­pac­ity of up to 80 mil­lion gal­lons (302.8 mil­lion litres) a day, enough to fill about 145 Olympic-sized swim­ming pools.</p>
    <p>It treats wa­ter from the Kranji, Pan­dan and Tengeh reser­voirs be­fore it is de­liv­ered to taps in homes, busi­nesses and in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng Joo Hee, PUB’s chief ex­ec­u­tive, said: “Our chal­lenge in Sin­ga­pore is to treat eco­nom­i­cally, to drink­ing wa­ter stan­dards, the run-off in what we be­lieve is the most ur­banised catch­ment in the world.</p>
    <p>“The de­ploy­ment of ce­ramic mem­branes in Choa Chu Kang Water­works, at scale and cur­rently the largest in the world, makes this al­most a breeze.</p>
    <p>“We are happy to have helped push the en­ve­lope in wa­ter treat­ment and are most grate­ful for the recog­ni­tion.”</p>
