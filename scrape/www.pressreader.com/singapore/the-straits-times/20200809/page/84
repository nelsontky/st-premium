    <h3>OUR SINGAPORE, WITH LOVE</h3>
    <p>
        | | B16 The Sunday Times Sunday, August 9, 2020 OUR SINGAPORE, WITH LOVE The lights are back on at Diamond Industries Words of support from our business to yours Together through thick and thin, let us stay united as one, and emerge stronger than ever. MR LOH NEE TONG 58, managing director, Owell Our economy and daily lives may be affected by the Covid-19 pandemic but Gain City, a home-grown brand, encourages everyone to stay united to fight this pandemic and emerge a stronger nation. The Covid-19 pandemic has turned 2020 into a bleak year for many businesses, but this homegrown company is forging ahead MR KENNY TEO Ms Olivia Chew (fırst row, in brown jacket) with the staff of Diamond Industries at one of the company’s events early this year. BY LOW SHI PING 49, managing director, Gain City PH OTO: DIAMOND INDUSTRIES JE WELLERY COMPANY T he showroom and offıce of Diamond Industries have been silent and empty since February but in mid-July, the lights were turned back on, the spaces were cleaned and disinfecte­d, and employees started to trickle back to work.
With National Day around the corner and Singapore well into Phase 2 of the reopening of its economy, Mr Frank Chew, the founder of the jewellery wholesale and manufactur­ing business, decided it was time to hit restart — albeit with a heavy dose of introspect­ion and gratitude.
In Diamond Industries’ fırst interview since it reopened, conducted over Skype, Mr Chew and his daughter and managing director Olivia took this reporter on a virtual tour of his showroom and proudly introduced his employees, many of whom had worked with him for over 20 years.
Sixty-nine-year-old Mr Chew, who set up Diamond Industries in 1989, has seen his fair share of trials and tribulatio­ns over the years, but the Covid-19 pandemic is a crisis like no other.
“We all hoped that Covid would blow over in two months’ time,” recalls Mr Chew. “But it quickly became clear continuing to work, but we kept the positions of all our other staff so that when we reopened, they would still have their jobs,” she says.
To ensure that employees are well taken care of, the company rosters them to work two to three days a week, with the younger ones doing the customer-facing roles, and the older staff remaining behind the scenes. The company has put in place additional safe distancing, SafeEntry check-ins and temperatur­e-taking measures to keep both staff and customers safe.
From now till the end of the month, Diamond Industries is offering promotiona­l prices on many of its jewellery pieces and gemstones. For many of Diamond Industries’ returning customers, nothing beats seeing the brilliance of the gemstones in person, adds Ms Chew.
Even though there is still great uncertaint­y ahead, Ms Chew and her father say the management draws strength from its loyal customers and supportive staff.
“These may be challengin­g times, but with the trust and support of customers and staff, many business owners are soldiering on and we believe we can emerge from this storm stronger,” says Mr Chew. that it’s a crisis of a generation that none of us expected.
“These are unpreceden­ted times. You can put your best foot forward, but you have no idea whether the ground will give way.”
Singapore saw its fırst coronaviru­s case on Jan 23 — the start of a chain of events that would lead to unpreceden­ted closures and restrictio­ns.
Like many other businesses, Diamond Industries, too, was caught in the pandemic storm. It entered into what Ms Chew describes as an “early hibernatio­n” after its showroom, located in the PSA Vista offıce building, was among the places visited by a group of Chinese tourists linked to Singapore’s fırst local Covid-19 cluster.
Hitting the pause button two months ahead of the circuit breaker was a decision made with staff safety in mind: More than half of Diamond Industries’ workforce is aged 55 and above, falling into the age group considered to be at higher risk of developing severe disease from Covid-19 infection, relative to those who are younger.
“We were closed for fıve months, with only the administra­tive staff Covid-19 has encouraged businesses like ours to better appreciate things that we previously took for granted. It may be a tough period, but I believe that we will be able to get through it with the right mindset. We can brave through this storm together. These may be challengin­g times, but with the trust and support of customers and staff, many business owners are soldiering on and we believe we can emerge from this storm stronger. MS TASNEEM NOOR 39, managing director, Fika Swedish Cafe, Konditori European Artisan Bakery and Lickety Waffles and Ice cream Having it easy was never part of Singapore’s DNA to success.
This latest challenge presents another opportunit­y to redefine ourselves. To my fellow business owners and local entreprene­urs: We have the important task of protecting our nation’s economic legacy. Let’s take this opportunit­y to invigorate ourselves to press on for ourselves, our country and our children.
