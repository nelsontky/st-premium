    <p>Com­mu­nity lead­ers have an im­por­tant role to play in rais­ing aware­ness among res­i­dents about where job and skill op­por­tu­ni­ties are avail­able.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion S. Iswaran said this in re­sponse to a ques­tion from a par­tic­i­pant dur­ing a vir­tual di­a­logue with the Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion In­dian Ac­tiv­ity Ex­ec­u­tive Com­mit­tees Coun­cil (Narpani Pear­a­vai) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>When asked about the cur­rent un­em­ploy­ment rate and how grass­roots lead­ers can help those in need dur­ing the pan­demic, he said: “Giv­ing our peo­ple a sense of con­fi­dence that we can over­come this, we can do well, and help­ing them have the right at­ti­tude about it, is key. I think as com­mu­nity lead­ers, all of us have an im­por­tant role to play here.”</p>
    <p>In his in­tro­duc­tory ad­dress to the par­tic­i­pants, he touched on the eco­nomic ef­fect of the pan­demic glob­ally and in Sin­ga­pore, and said that while some in­dus­tries had been se­verely af­fected, there were op­por­tu­ni­ties in sec­tors such as in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy, health­care and ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Iswaran was joined at the nearly two-hour-long ses­sion by Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Health and Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion, Dr Janil Puthuc­heary, who is also an ad­viser to Narpani Pear­a­vai.</p>
    <p>The di­a­logue, at­tended by about 200 par­tic­i­pants from In­dian or­gan­i­sa­tions and grass­roots vol­un­teers, was con­vened to let com­mu­nity lead­ers share their ideas and views on re­cent de­vel­op­ments in Sin­ga­pore and seek clar­i­fi­ca­tions from the two pan­el­lists, Mr Iswaran and Dr Janil.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to a ques­tion on as­sis­tance for re­tired se­nior ci­ti­zens af­fected by Covid-19, Dr Janil said it was im­por­tant to en­sure their costs in ar­eas such as health­care, trans­port and hous­ing do not rise.</p>
    <p>Re­ply­ing to an­other ques­tion on post-pan­demic ed­u­ca­tion in Sin­ga­pore, he said: “What we have seen in the last few years is an in­creas­ing link be­tween in­dus­try and our ed­u­ca­tion space. That has served us well in the past and is likely to serve us well in the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>In his con­clud­ing re­marks, Mr Iswaran touched on the im­por­tance of main­tain­ing har­mony and re­ject­ing di­vi­sive think­ing dur­ing an eco­nomic down­turn.</p>
    <p>“We want to make sure that Sin­ga­pore­ans do well, thrive and take full ad­van­tage of op­por­tu­ni­ties, but we also want to make sure that we stay open as a coun­try so that we can con­tinue to ben­e­fit from the con­tri­bu­tions of those who are com­ing here be­cause they want to be part of us and con­trib­ute to the growth of Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
