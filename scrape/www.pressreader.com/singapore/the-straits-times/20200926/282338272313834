    <p>The for­mer head of world ath­let­ics Lamine Di­ack was back be­fore a judge in Paris on Thurs­day a week af­ter his con­vic­tion for cor­rup­tion in cov­er­ing up Rus­sian dop­ing cases, ju­di­cial sources re­ported.</p>
    <p>This time, the 87-year-old was be­ing quizzed as part of an in­ves­ti­ga­tion into an al­leged votes-for-cash scan­dal in­volv­ing the 2016 and 2020 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Di­ack “was in­ter­viewed to­day” con­firmed one of his lawyers, Si­mon Ndi­aye, with­out dis­clos­ing any fur­ther de­tails.</p>
    <p>Last week, the Sene­galese was sen­tenced to four years in pri­son, two of which were sus­pended, for his part in hush­ing up 23 Rus­sian dop­ing of­fences so the ath­letes in­volved could com­pete at the 2012 London Olympics and 2013 world cham­pi­onships in Moscow.</p>
    <p>Other for­mer se­nior fig­ures in track and field, in­clud­ing Di­ack’s son, Papa Mas­sata Di­ack, and the In­ter­na­tional As­so­ci­a­tion of Ath­let­ics Fed­er­a­tions’ (IAAF) for­mer head of anti-dop­ing Gabriel Dolle, were also given pri­son terms for their part in the scheme.</p>
    <p>Thurs­day’s ju­di­cial out­ing not only con­cerned the case of Rio and Tokyo, but also the at­tri­bu­tion of the world ath­let­ics cham­pi­onships in 2015 to Bei­jing, and in 2017 and 2019 when Qatar was a can­di­date.</p>
    <p>Along with his son, Di­ack is sus­pected of tak­ing bribes, some dis­guised as lob­by­ing con­tracts, in re­turn for lend­ing sup­port to the host cities.</p>
    <p>French au­thor­i­ties are prob­ing pay­ments of US$1.197 mil­lion (S$1.64 mil­lion) and US$1.685 mil­lion by the Tokyo bid com­mit­tee to Black Tid­ings, a Sin­ga­pore-based firm linked to Papa Mas­sata, be­fore and af­ter the Ja­panese cap­i­tal was awarded the 2020 Games in 2013 by the In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee (IOC).</p>
    <p>As a for­mer mem­ber of the IOC,</p>
    <p>Di­ack had in­flu­ence over African votes at the time of the Tokyo bid in Septem­ber 2013.</p>
    <p>The for­mer head of the Tokyo bid com­mit­tee, Tsunekazu Takeda, was charged with cor­rup­tion in De­cem­ber 2018 by French in­ves­ti­gat­ing mag­is­trates.</p>
    <p>Di­ack has since ac­knowl­edged he voted for the Ja­panese cap­i­tal and told many of his fel­low African IOC mem­bers that he had done so, but de­nies cor­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Ja­pan’s Ky­odo News re­ported that Black Tid­ings paid some US$370,000 to Papa Mas­sata be­fore and af­ter Tokyo was picked as hosts.</p>
