    <p>HONG KONG China warned yes­ter­day that the mass res­ig­na­tions of pro-democ­racy law­mak­ers in Hong Kong were a “bla­tant chal­lenge” to its au­thor­ity over the city.</p>
    <p>Fif­teen leg­is­la­tors quit the cham­ber in protest against the Bei­jing­sanc­tioned ouster of four col­leagues, leav­ing the as­sem­bly a muted gath­er­ing of gov­ern­ment loy­al­ists.</p>
    <p>“This move makes it clear that dic­ta­tor­ship has de­scended onto Hong Kong and that the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party can erad­i­cate all op­pos­ing voices in the leg­is­la­ture,” said Mr Fer­nando Che­ung, one of the law­mak­ers. “There’s no more sep­a­ra­tion of pow­ers, no more ‘one coun­try, two sys­tems’, and there­fore no more Hong Kong as we know it.”</p>
    <p>The res­ig­na­tions sparked a fu­ri­ous re­sponse from Bei­jing’s Hong Kong and Ma­cau Af­fairs Of­fice.</p>
    <p>“It once again showed their stub­born con­fronta­tion against the cen­tral gov­ern­ment and a bla­tant chal­lenge to the power of the cen­tral gov­ern­ment. We se­verely con­demn this,” a state­ment said. “We have to tell these op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers, that if they want to use this to ad­vo­cate a rad­i­cal fight, and beg for for­eign forces to in­ter­fere, and once again drag Hong Kong into chaos, that’s a wrong cal­cu­la­tion.”</p>
    <p>In­side the cham­ber, gov­ern­ment loy­al­ists dis­cussed a trans­port Bill, but with­out any of the ram­bunc­tious de­bate that has been the mark of Hong Kong’s semi-democ­racy in re­cent years.</p>

    <p>rie Lam, a Bei­jing ap­pointee, on Wed­nes­day was granted the power to turf out any leg­is­la­tor whom she deems in­suf­fi­ciently pa­tri­otic, with­out re­course to the city’s courts.</p>
    <p>She im­me­di­ately made use of</p>
    <p>those pow­ers, kick­ing out four law­mak­ers she said were a threat to na­tional se­cu­rity, and spark­ing crit­i­cism both at home and abroad, with the United States threat­en­ing fur­ther sanc­tions on regime fig­ures.</p>

    <p>Robert O’Brien said China’s lat­est clam­p­down in Hong Kong shows that the “one coun­try, two sys­tems” ar­range­ment for the ter­ri­tory amounts to a “fig leaf” for dic­ta­tor­ship.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain yes­ter­day said China had bro­ken its main bi­lat­eral treaty on Hong Kong, cau­tion­ing that it would con­sider also sanc­tions as part of its re­sponse.</p>
    <p>“Bei­jing’s im­po­si­tion of new rules to dis­qual­ify elected leg­is­la­tors in Hong Kong con­sti­tutes a clear breach of the legally bind­ing Si­noBri­tish Joint Dec­la­ra­tion,” For­eign Sec­re­tary Do­minic Raab said.</p>
    <p>The city’s last colo­nial gov­er­nor Chris Pat­ten said the move demon­strated Bei­jing’s “to­tal hos­til­ity to demo­cratic ac­count­abil­ity, and those who wish to stand up for it”.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Union called on China to “im­me­di­ately re­verse” the rules placed on Hong Kong’s leg­is­la­ture and urged the leg­is­la­tors’ “im­me­di­ate re­in­state­ment”.</p>
    <p>Any sanc­tions would in­fu­ri­ate Bei­jing and ac­cel­er­ate a de­te­ri­o­ra­tion in re­la­tions be­tween the na­tions on a va­ri­ety of is­sues.</p>
    <p>China’s For­eign Min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin re­jected the in­ter­na­tional crit­i­cism. “We urge the rel­e­vant peo­ple to strictly abide by the ba­sic norms of in­ter­na­tional law and in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions, stop any form of in­ter­fer­ence into China’s in­ter­nal af­fairs, of which Hong Kong af­fairs are a part,” he said.</p>
    <p>The ex­o­dus of op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers neuters one of the last fo­rums for dis­sent in Hong Kong, as its me­dia reels un­der a crack­down un­leashed by the na­tional se­cu­rity law and Bei­jing loy­al­ists tar­get the le­gal sys­tem that has un­der­pinned the city’s suc­cess as a fi­nance hub.</p>
