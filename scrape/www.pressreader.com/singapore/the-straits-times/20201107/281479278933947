    <p>Malaysia will con­tinue pump-prim­ing its coro­n­avirus-bat­tered econ­omy, with Bud­get 2021 un­veiled yes­ter­day be­ing the na­tion’s largest ever, in a bid to re­verse its first re­ces­sion in over a decade.</p>
    <p>The pro­jected 5.4 per cent deficit for next year is lower than this year’s 6 per cent – which is in part due to a short­fall in rev­enue by 7 per cent to RM227.3 bil­lion (S$74 bil­lion) this year.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment’s to­tal ex­pen­di­ture is pro­jected to top RM322 bil­lion (S$105 bil­lion) next year, 2.5 per cent more than this year, de­spite sev­eral stim­u­lus pack­ages an­nounced this year.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin had said ear­lier this week that his ad­min­is­tra­tion’s first bud­get will be ex­pan­sion­ary, in line with bi­par­ti­san calls to res­cue cit­i­zens and busi­nesses, given that gross do­mes­tic prod­uct is ex­pected to shrink by 4.5 per cent this year, the first con­trac­tion since 2009.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy is pro­jected to re­bound with growth of be­tween 6.5 per cent and 7.5 per cent next year.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah, has in re­cent weeks re­peat­edly called on law­mak­ers to back the bud­get to en­sure the fight against Covid-19 is well funded.</p>
    <p>This comes amid grow­ing un­cer­tainty since Septem­ber over Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s ma­jor­ity, which was al­ready ra­zor-thin at the last par­lia­men­tary sit­ting in Au­gust, with just 113 out of 222 MPs in the gov­ern­ment bench.</p>
    <p>“This is an un­prece­dented cri­sis... de­scribed as the worst eco­nomic cri­sis since the 1930s’ Great De­pres­sion,” Fi­nance Min­is­ter Tengku Zafrul Aziz said when tabling the bud­get.</p>
    <p>“We can ar­gue and dis­agree on sec­ondary is­sues, but we should unite to agree on prin­ci­ple.”</p>
    <p>Among ini­tia­tives to ease the public bur­den are cash hand­outs to 8.1 mil­lion re­cip­i­ents worth RM6.5 bil­lion, as com­pared with Bud­get 2020’s RM5 bil­lion for 4.3 mil­lion ben­e­fi­cia­ries.</p>
    <p>A new RM3.7 bil­lion jobs scheme to sub­sidise up to 40 per cent of wages is ex­pected to cre­ate 500,000 new op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>How­ever, an­a­lysts be­lieve the bud­get l acks sub­stan­tive mea­sures to over­come the con­tin­u­ing im­pact of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Any ex­pan­sion­ary bud­get will spur the econ­omy. But it lacks a plan for sus­tain­able and eq­ui­table growth to re­pair the dam­age suf­fered and im­bal­ances ex­ac­er­bated due to the Covid-19 pan­demic,” Ke­nanga In­vest­ment’s head of eco­nomic re­search Wan Suhaimie Sai­die told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Malaysia has an­nounced four stim­u­lus pack­ages so far this year, to soften the eco­nomic im­pact of Covid-19-re­lated shut­downs, val­ued at RM305 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>A to­tal di­rect fis­cal in­jec­tion of RM55 bil­lion has led to the Fi­nance Min­istry nearly dou­bling the 3.2 per cent deficit fore­cast in Bud­get 2020, which was tabled last year. How­ever, the deficit spike will see a huge in­crease in bor­row­ings, as to­tal rev­enue is only slightly more than the op­er­at­ing ex­pen­di­ture of RM226.7 bil­lion and RM236.5 bil­lion for this year and next year re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the gov­ern­ment’s fis­cal out­look re­port, funds raised for Covid-19 stim­u­lus and de­vel­op­ment ex­pen­di­ture worth RM88 bil­lion and RM85 bil­lion this year and next year, re­spec­tively, will be fi­nanced with debt, up from RM54 bil­lion in de­vel­op­ment spend­ing for last year.</p>
    <p>Kuala Lumpur is seek­ing to di­ver­sify fur­ther from a re­liance on petroleum. The gov­ern­ment fore­casts just RM37.8 bil­lion in to­tal petroleum rev­enue next year, against the RM50 bil­lion this year.</p>
    <p>The sharp drop next year will be largely due to a lower div­i­dend pay­out of RM18 bil­lion from state oil gi­ant Petronas, in­stead of the RM34 bil­lion this year and RM54 bil­lion last year.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Zafrul also re­vealed that the Muhyid­din ad­min­is­tra­tion in­tends to pro­ceed with the Rapid Tran­sit Sys­tem link­ing Jo­hor Baru and Sin­ga­pore, while “the gov­ern­ment will also con­tinue the High-Speed Rail Project or HSR as this project is ex­pected to gen­er­ate a pos­i­tive mul­ti­plier ef­fect to the coun­try’s econ­omy. How­ever, it is sub­ject to fur­ther dis­cus­sion with Sin­ga­pore”.</p>
