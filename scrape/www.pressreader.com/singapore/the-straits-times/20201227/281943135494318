    <p>Malay/Mus­lim Sin­ga­pore­ans have re­sponded in a re­spon­si­ble way to Covid-19 this year and helped keep the coro­n­avirus from spread­ing fur­ther, Min­is­ter-in-charge of Mus­lim Af­fairs Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli said last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Masa­gos, who is also the Min­is­ter for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment, high­lighted how the com­mu­nity not only stepped up to help one an­other, but also played their part in curb­ing the spread of the virus in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a me­dia in­ter­view with Malay/Mus­lim lead­ers on Dec 18, the min­is­ter held up the ad­just­ments the com­mu­nity made to its way of life to pre­vent the virus sit­u­a­tion from wors­en­ing here.</p>
    <p>These in­clude ac­cept­ing the clo­sure of mosques, the sus­pen­sion of con­gre­ga­tional prayers, the post­pone­ment of the haj pil­grim­age and the in­abil­ity to visit loved ones dur­ing Hari Raya cel­e­bra­tions.</p>
    <p>At the same time, Malay/Mus­lim</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans worked to help those among them who were most in need.</p>
    <p>Mr Masa­gos said the com­mu­nity raised $3 mil­lion for the SGUnited Buka Puasa – a ground-up ef­fort dur­ing the fast­ing month of Ra­madan, which be­gan in late April and co­in­cided with the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>The amount, which was raised within a month of its launch, was used to dis­trib­ute food to 20,000 front-lin­ers and needy fam­i­lies on a daily ba­sis. “These are all great out­comes from the spirit of to­geth­er­ness in our com­mu­nity – the level of achieve­ment, of be­ing ed­u­cated in an open so­ci­ety, be­ing able to get the com­mu­nity to­gether,” said Mr Masa­gos.</p>
    <p>“Not only for what it needs for it­self, but also to con­trib­ute to­wards not spread­ing the virus to other peo­ple be­cause of the prac­tices that we are used to.”</p>
    <p>He said that through the sound ad­vice and co­op­er­a­tion of re­li­gious au­thor­i­ties and med­i­cal ex­perts in the com­mu­nity, clear guide­lines for re­li­gious so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties could be given promptly.</p>
    <p>Large-scale re­li­gious ac­tiv­i­ties have been known to be flash­points for Covid-19 clus­ters to de­velop.</p>
    <p>A no­table one was a Mus­lim mis­sion­ary move­ment’s gath­er­ing at a mosque on the out­skirts of Kuala Lumpur from Feb 27 to March 1, which re­port­edly in­volved up to 10,000 peo­ple and re­sulted in sev­eral im­ported cases of the virus.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing this, the Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore de­cided to close mosques in Sin­ga­pore later in March.</p>
    <p>Asked whether it would be pos­si­ble to re­sume spe­cial con­gre­ga­tional prayers – known as ter­awih prayers – at mosques dur­ing next year’s Ra­madan, Mr Masa­gos said the au­thor­i­ties hope to al­low for them to con­tinue and mul­ti­ple, shorter ses­sions could be con­sid­ered.</p>
