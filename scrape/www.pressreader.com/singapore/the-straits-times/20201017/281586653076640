    <p>Ex­porters had another good month in Septem­ber, but the slower pace has prompted an­a­lysts to warn that the road to re­cov­ery re­mains bumpy. Non-oil do­mes­tic ex­ports rose 5.9 per cent over the same month last year, but it was markedly down on Au­gust’s 7.7 per cent ex­pan­sion and missed the 11.5 per cent rise fore­cast by econ­o­mists in a Bloomberg poll.</p>
    <p>Ex­porters had another good month in Septem­ber but the slower pace has prompted an­a­lysts to warn that the road to re­cov­ery re­mains bumpy.</p>
    <p>Non-oil do­mes­tic ex­ports (Nodx) rose 5.9 per cent over the same month last year, but that was markedly down on Au­gust’s 7.7 per cent ex­pan­sion and missed the 11.5 per cent rise fore­cast by econ­o­mists in a Bloomberg poll.</p>
    <p>Nodx has now risen in seven out of nine months of this year com­pared with only one month of gain last year.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mist Sung Eun Jung from Ox­ford Eco­nomics said: “While Sin­ga­pore’s trade has turned the cor­ner af­ter con­tract­ing in May, its re­cov­ery path re­mains un­cer­tain as coun­tries still grap­ple with lo­calised out­breaks. Ac­cord­ingly, we ex­pect the re­cov­ery in trade to ease in the fourth quar­ter.”</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment pre­dicted in Au­gust that Nodx would grow by 3 per cent to 5 per cent this year over last year, re­vers­ing an ear­lier view of a 1 per cent to 4 per cent fall.</p>
    <p>Nodx last month shrank 11.3 per cent on a sea­son­ally ad­justed ba­sis from the pre­vi­ous month af­ter a 10.5 per cent ex­pan­sion from July to Au­gust. The main cul­prit was a de­cline in non-elec­tron­ics ex­ports that out­weighed the growth in elec­tron­ics ship­ments.</p>
    <p>Last month’s Nodx was mainly driven by elec­tronic goods from a low base last year, En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore data noted yes­ter­day, with ship­ments up 21.4 per cent year on year af­ter a 5.7 per cent in­crease in Au­gust. Ex­ports of in­te­grated cir­cuits shot up 30.1 per cent, disk me­dia prod­ucts grew 15.2 per cent while PC parts ex­panded 22.7 per cent.</p>
    <p>May­bank Kim Eng econ­o­mists</p>
    <p>Chua Hak Bin and Lee Ju Ye noted that global de­mand for semi­con­duc­tors re­mains firm as more peo­ple are buy­ing work-from-home gad­gets and in­dus­tries are go­ing dig­i­tal amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Bar­clays Bank econ­o­mist Brian Tan said last month’s slower rate of growth was mainly due to a sharp pull­back in non-elec­tron­ics ex­ports, es­pe­cially non-mone­tary gold, which off­set the boost from a favourable base ef­fect in elec­tron­ics ship­ments.</p>
    <p>Non-elec­tron­ics Nodx rose 1.8 per cent last month af­ter 8.3 per cent growth in Au­gust. The big­gest con­trib­u­tors were non-mone­tary gold, up 53.4 per cent, spe­cialised ma­chin­ery, ahead 34.2 per cent, and food prepa­ra­tion ship­ments, which rose 30.7 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ms Se­lena Ling, OCBC Bank’s head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy, noted the un­ex­pected drag from phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal ex­ports, which plunged 27.3 per cent year on year.</p>
    <p>“(This) could be due to the high base last year. Nev­er­the­less, the volatile na­ture of the Covid-19 pan­demic and vac­il­lat­ing global vac­cine prospects could also mean that one can­not rely on phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals ex­ports to drive Nodx growth,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Ling said that Nodx growth in the fourth quar­ter could ease to around 2.2 per cent year on year. “I ex­pect fourth-quar­ter Nodx growth may run into a more bumpy road, given the lat­est Covid-19 uptick in Europe and the con­di­tional move­ment con­trol or­der in Malaysia.”</p>
    <p>Ship­ments reached $13.8 bil­lion last month, down from $15.6 bil­lion in Au­gust, on a sea­son­ally ad­justed ba­sis.</p>
    <p>Ex­ports to Sin­ga­pore’s top mar­kets as a whole grew last month but de­clined for In­done­sia, Hong Kong, Thai­land and South Korea.</p>
    <p>Ship­ments to the Euro­pean Union’s 27 mem­ber states surged 60.5 per cent and rose 28.8 per cent to Malaysia but ad­vanced just 3.7 per cent to the United States.</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­pore’s trade has turned the cor­ner af­ter con­tract­ing in May, its re­cov­ery path re­mains un­cer­tain as coun­tries still grap­ple with lo­calised out­breaks.</p>
