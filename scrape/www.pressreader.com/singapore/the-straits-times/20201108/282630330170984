    <p>Beauty in­dus­try ex­ec­u­tive Amy Quek saw the value of build­ing fi­nan­cial in­de­pen­dence early in life after her father died when she was just 12.</p>
    <p>Ms Quek, 55, tells The Sun­day Times: “He was the sole bread­win­ner in the fam­ily, and this taught me to be self-suf­fi­cient.</p>
    <p>“When we reach a cer­tain age, we will want to grow our fi­nances, which is what drove me to start ex­plor­ing in­vest­ing.”</p>
    <p>Much of that in­vest­ing has been in her own com­pa­nies – skin­care chain BMF Bella Marie France and Sven­son Hair Cen­ter – which she has built steadily over the years.</p>
    <p>The brands now have 10 out­lets here in to­tal, in­clud­ing in malls like Or­chard Gate­way.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic and re­sult­ing shut­downs could have dealt the en­ter­prise a se­vere blow, but Ms Quek’s de­ci­sion to in­vest in dig­i­tal so­lu­tions en­abled it to stay afloat.</p>
    <p>“With the gov­ern­ment-man­dated clo­sure of our treat­ment cen­tres, we re­lied on our e-com­merce plat­form dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker to en­sure that our clients and other new cus­tomers con­tinue to have ac­cess to our prod­ucts round the clock,” she says.</p>
    <p>“Grow­ing our on­line pres­ence both on so­cial me­dia and e-com­merce had helped us pivot our busi­ness to a more dig­i­talised and ef­fi­cient op­er­a­tion model that helped to en­sure busi­ness con­ti­nu­ity.”</p>
    <p>She adds that the com­pany re­tained staff with no pay cuts, thanks to sup­port from gov­ern­ment schemes.</p>
    <p>The team also con­tin­ued to stay con­nected to clients through phone calls and mes­sages.</p>
    <p>Ms Quek, whose be­lief in life­long learn­ing led her to a master’s in busi­ness ad­min­is­tra­tion from Mur­doch Univer­sity this year, started her ca­reer as a con­sul­tant at Marie France Body­line Sin­ga­pore be­fore ris­ing through the ranks.</p>
    <p>Bella Marie France re­sulted from a merger of Bella Skin Care and Marie France Body­line.</p>
    <p>Now, BMF Bella Marie France of­fers skin­care and body sculpt­ing treat­ments, while Sven­son Hair Cen­ter pro­vides hair-loss and hair­weav­ing ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The brands come un­der um­brella com­pany Global Beauty In­ter­na­tional, which is head­quar­tered here. It owns and op­er­ates a net­work of beauty treat­ment cen­tres in Sin­ga­pore, Hong Kong, Ma­cau and Malaysia.</p>
    <p>The busi­ness, which started in 1989, now has a head­count of about 500. It racked up an­nual turnover of around US$43 mil­lion (S$58 mil­lion) last year, while earn­ings be­fore in­ter­est, taxes and amor­ti­sa­tion grew by about 40 per cent from 2016 to last year.</p>
    <p>Ms Quek is mar­ried with three chil­dren aged 30, 26 and 19, and a one-year-old grand­child. She de­clined to re­veal her hus­band’s oc­cu­pa­tion.</p>
    <p>Q A</p>
    <p>What’s in your port­fo­lio?</p>
    <p>I am gen­er­ally a safe in­vestor (but) I pre­fer to in­vest more in for­eign cur­rency-linked struc­tured notes with higher re­turns de­spite their volatil­ity, and I lever­age with cur­rency ex­change rates and the in­ter­est through a 15-month ten­ure.</p>
    <p>How­ever, now that we’re in the midst of a pan­demic, I am more cau­tious, aside from the in­vest­ments I have made pre-pan­demic.</p>
    <p>I have ac­tu­ally taken a break from in­vest­ments since July last year due to mar­ket un­cer­tain­ties, such as the protests in Hong Kong, the United States and China trade war and now the pan­demic, so I’m play­ing it safe for now un­til things are more sta­ble.</p>
    <p>I also like the flex­i­bil­ity of forex in­vest­ments as I can go ei­ther long or short term. Some­times, if I pre­dict that both cur­ren­cies will in­crease in value, I will in­vest in both – the base cur­rency and the quote cur­rency. I have bought eu­ros, Bri­tish pounds, and US and Aus­tralian dol­lars.</p>
    <p>I don’t have much time to watch over the mar­ket, hence I don’t nor­mally in­vest in stocks and shares.</p>
    <p>My port­fo­lio is 70 per cent struc­tured notes and the re­main­ing 30 per cent on forex or for­eign cur­rency.</p>
    <p>Q What are your im­me­di­ate in­vest­ment plans?</p>
    <p>A On the pro­fes­sional front, as an ar­dent ad­vo­cate of adopt­ing in­no­va­tive tech­nol­ogy to drive vis­i­ble and ef­fec­tive re­sults through our treat­ments, we plan to re­in­force this com­pet­i­tive edge that the busi­ness has and is known for, by in­vest­ing US$2 mil­lion to pro­cure 40 units of the lat­est treat­ment equip­ment for the group.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to the pro­vi­sion of the lat­est and most ad­vanced tech­nolo­gies in our beauty treat­ments, the train­ing and up­grad­ing of our em­ploy­ees play a key role in my busi­ness ap­proach. Last year alone, we ac­cu­mu­lated 1,106 train­ing hours for the group.</p>
    <p>We in­tend to con­tinue in­vest­ing in our em­ploy­ees through train­ing hours, and thus pro­vid­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for growth and im­prove­ment for them as in­di­vid­u­als, and for the group as a whole.</p>
    <p>Q De­scribe your in­vest­ing strat­egy.</p>
    <p>A My strat­egy is sim­ple – I pre­fer some­thing that doesn’t take up too much of my time as I have a very hec­tic work­ing sched­ule. I have tried in­vest­ing with the help of a bro­ker, and the re­turns were very slow, though safe.</p>
    <p>My in­vest­ment monies are set aside from spare cash, and, with this in mind, I much pre­fer to in­vest in a mix­ture of risks and lever­ages, such as notes in dif­fer­ent cur­ren­cies, and, even if my notes get knocked out, I’ll still have the forex and in­ter­est as a buf­fer.</p>
    <p>Q What else is in your fi­nan­cial plan?</p>
    <p>A I will cer­tainly draw up my will, Last­ing Power of At­tor­ney and Ad­vance Med­i­cal Di­rec­tive. I don’t be­lieve in leav­ing be­hind prob­lems for my chil­dren, or putting my chil­dren in a dif­fi­cult po­si­tion of hav­ing to make de­ci­sions on my be­half.</p>
    <p>Q How are you plan­ning for re­tire­ment?</p>
    <p>A I’ve no­ticed on nu­mer­ous oc­ca­sions that peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore have to com­pro­mise their stan­dards of liv­ing after re­tire­ment. After spend­ing many years work­ing and build­ing my ca­reer, I hope to be able to main­tain a sim­i­lar life­style that I had en­joyed pre-re­tire­ment – I still want to drive, en­joy the oc­ca­sional din­ner at a nice Miche­lin-starred restau­rant and, of course, travel – hence the in­vest­ments in my busi­ness and per­sonal port­fo­lio.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing said that, I per­son­ally do not think there should be an age for re­tire­ment. I be­lieve that as long as I am still pas­sion­ate about what I’m do­ing, I will con­tinue to build my busi­ness and con­trib­ute to the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>At any age, hav­ing pas­sion has to be your strong­est driv­ing force and is very im­por­tant in all as­pects of life and what we do.</p>
    <p>At 55, I ac­quired my master’s in busi­ness ad­min­is­tra­tion with Mur­doch Univer­sity be­cause I be­lieve that con­stant learn­ing and gain­ing knowl­edge have no age limit.</p>
    <p>Q What does money mean to you?</p>
    <p>A When we sud­denly lost my father, who was the sole bread­win­ner of the fam­ily, all our rel­a­tives avoided us as they were afraid that we would be a bur­den to them. Hence, from the age of 12, I learnt to work hard and be self-suf­fi­cient so as to help my mother make ends meet. I feel blessed with how far things have come and I am able to share my bless­ings with oth­ers who are less for­tu­nate and might not have the means to af­ford even a sim­ple meal.</p>
    <p>As such, I do make a con­scious ef­fort to give back to so­ci­ety, both on a per­sonal and pro­fes­sional level. Re­cently, BMF Bella Marie France and Sven­son Hair Cen­ter do­nated $40,874, which is from a per­cent­age of our sales from July to Au­gust this year, to Food from the Heart, a char­ity that reaches out to the less for­tu­nate and bright­ens up their lives by al­le­vi­at­ing hunger through a food dis­tri­bu­tion pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Q A</p>
    <p>Home is now ...</p>
    <p>A 2,500 sq ft pent­house in cen­tral Sin­ga­pore with four bed­rooms, two liv­ing halls and a rooftop ter­race, with my hus­band and two chil­dren who are not mar­ried.</p>
    <p>Q I drive ...</p>
    <p>A A black Mercedes-Benz S350</p>
