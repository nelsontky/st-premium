    <p>A prime free­hold site at 15 Hoe Chi­ang Road will be put up for sale with a guide price of $715 mil­lion via ex­pres­sion of in­ter­est to­day, ex­clu­sive mar­ket­ing agent JLL said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The free­hold 39,337 sq ft site has been ap­proved for hos­pi­tal­ity use with a gross floor area (GFA) of about 248,483 sq ft, or an equiv­a­lent gross plot ra­tio (GPR) of above 6.31, based on writ­ten per­mis­sion is­sued in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Pro­vi­sional per­mis­sion was granted early this year al­low­ing for an ex­tra 25 per cent of GFA ap­proved for pro­posed use on the site with an­cil­lary fa­cil­i­ties and carparks of up to 37 storeys.</p>
    <p>This ef­fec­tively in­creases the GFA to about 310,604 sq ft un­der the Cen­tral Busi­ness Dis­trict (CBD) In­cen­tive Scheme, JLL said.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, the site has non-res­i­den­tial zon­ing, which means there is no ad­di­tional buyer’s stamp duty payable and no for­eign own­er­ship re­stric­tions. The build­ing that sits on the site – Tower Fif­teen – has since been de­com­mis­sioned, ac­cord­ing to JLL.</p>
    <p>Buy­ers of the site will be able to cap­i­talise on the ad­di­tional GPR ac­corded un­der the CBD In­cen­tive Scheme, JLL said.</p>
    <p>The scheme was created to en­cour­age the con­ver­sion of ex­ist­ing of­fice de­vel­op­ments to ho­tel and res­i­den­tial uses, and ap­plies to the An­son Road, Ce­cil Street, Shen­ton Way, Robin­son Road and Tan­jong Pa­gar ar­eas.</p>
    <p>The site was pre­vi­ously put up for sale in 2015 via ex­pres­sion of in­ter­est, but did not change hands, The Busi­ness Times un­der­stands.</p>
    <p>This was be­fore the launch of the CBD In­cen­tive Scheme in March last year.</p>
    <p>Sub­ject to plan­ning ap­proval, de­vel­op­ers and in­vestors will have sev­eral op­tions un­der the in­cen­tive scheme.</p>
    <p>They in­clude a “res­i­den­tial and com­mer­cial” de­vel­op­ment with at least 60 per cent res­i­den­tial GFA or a full ho­tel with 25 per cent ad­di­tional GPR.</p>
    <p>There is an op­tion of “res­i­den­tial with com­mer­cial at the first storey” with an ad­di­tional 30 per cent GPR.</p>
    <p>The Hoe Chi­ang Road site is across from the Tan­jong Pa­gar Ter­mi­nal con­tainer port and about 500m from Tan­jong Pa­gar MRT sta­tion and 650m from Ou­tram Park In­ter­change.</p>
    <p>It is also near the up­com­ing Can­ton­ment MRT sta­tion and Prince Ed­ward MRT sta­tion, both slated to be com­pleted in 2025.</p>
    <p>It is in the cen­tre of many es­tab­lished Grade A of­fices, ho­tels and food and bev­er­age of­fer­ings along Shen­ton Way, An­son Road, Tan­jong Pa­gar Road, Can­ton­ment Road and her­itage clus­ters of con­ser­va­tion shop­houses.</p>
    <p>High-end res­i­den­tial de­vel­op­ments such as Wal­lich Res­i­dence, Al­tez, V On Shen­ton, Icon and Sky­suites @ An­son are nearby.</p>
    <p>Upon re­de­vel­op­ment with a new tower, 15 Hoe Chi­ang Road will pro­vide future oc­cu­pants panoramic sea views to­wards Sen­tosa and the South­ern Is­lands in the con­text of the up­com­ing Greater South­ern Wa­ter­front mas­ter­plan, JLL said.</p>
    <p>The lat­est ex­pres­sion of in­ter­est ex­er­cise will close on Sept 11 at 2.30pm.</p>
