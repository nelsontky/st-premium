    <p>Many work­places usu­ally re­ver­ber­ate with the sound of year-end cel­e­bra­tions and other fes­tiv­i­ties in De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>This year, not so much.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has pushed many cor­po­ra­tions to tighten their purse strings and sup­pli­ers of cor­po­rate gifts are now feel­ing the pinch.</p>
    <p>“Cor­po­rate cus­tomers seem to be more mind­ful of their spend­ing,” said Ms Jess Chan, prod­uct and ser­vices man­ager of Noel Gifts.</p>
    <p>“We have more in­quiries and pend­ing or­ders than real sales locked in.”</p>
    <p>Mr Calvin Foo, co-founder of Gift Mar­ket, gave a sim­i­lar opin­ion.</p>
    <p>“There’s a bud­get is­sue. The big multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tions are be­ing more con­ser­va­tive,” he said.</p>
    <p>Gift Mar­ket, which sells non-per­ish­able items such as shirts, note­books and pens, saw its num­ber of or­ders drop by “al­most 70 per cent to 80 per cent” dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker im­posed ear­lier this year to stem the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Now, de­spite sales pick­ing up again, the out­look re­mains un­cer­tain.</p>
    <p>Mr Foo cal­cu­lated that Gift Mar­ket re­ceived around 600 or­ders last month, com­pared with 900 or­ders in the same month last year.</p>
    <p>Aside from more fru­gal spend­ing, work-from-home ar­range­ments and curbs on large gath­er­ings have also lim­ited the op­por­tu­ni­ties for cor­po­rate events.</p>
    <p>Gone too are the year-end cel­e­bra­tions where em­ploy­ees gather to mark cer­tain mile­stones or</p>
    <p>Christ­mas and the New Year.</p>
    <p>Noel Gifts, which has a cat­a­logue ded­i­cated to Christ­mas prod­ucts, said its or­ders have dropped by about 20 per cent.</p>
    <p>When gift-giv­ing does hap­pen, it is of­ten more sub­dued and with an eye to­wards util­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Foo said items such as masks and other prod­ucts re­lated to Covid-19 are “more pop­u­lar, per­haps be­cause peo­ple find them more prac­ti­cal”.</p>
    <p>Ms Chan said com­pa­nies are re­quest­ing Christ­mas and New Year gifts that are more prac­ti­cal, such as hand sani­tiser and health-re­lated food op­tions.</p>
    <p>Three other cor­po­rate gifts sup­pli­ers de­clined to com­ment when con­tacted by The Sun­day Times.</p>
