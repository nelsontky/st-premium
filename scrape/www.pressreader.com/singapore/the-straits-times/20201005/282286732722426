    <p>VER­SA­TIL­ITY IS KEY</p>
    <p>What I liked is we adapted to a very dif­fer­ent sce­nario. We had the right pa­tience.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>Arsenal teenager Bukayo Saka cel­e­brated his first Eng­land call-up by putting the Gun­ners on course for a 2-1 win against Sh­effield United yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Saka was i ncluded i n Gareth South­gate’s squad ear­lier this week for up­com­ing in­ter­na­tion­als against Wales, Bel­gium and Den­mark. But it was his club man­ager he re­warded im­me­di­ately, with the promis­ing 19-year-old giv­ing Arsenal the lead with his first goal at the Emi­rates Sta­dium.</p>
    <p>Ni­co­las Pepe came off the bench to add Arsenal’s sec­ond as Mikel Arteta’s team struck twice in four minutes in the sec­ond half.</p>
    <p>David McGoldrick got United’s first league goal of the term in the clos­ing stages, but it was too late.</p>
    <p>Arsenal were not at their best, but Arteta will be en­cour­aged by the way they kept their fo­cus and even­tu­ally found a way to se­cure their third Premier League win in four matches this sea­son.</p>
    <p>It was the kind of game that has tripped up Arsenal in re­cent years and the vic­tory un­der­lined their progress since Arteta took charge in De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>The FA Cup hold­ers are un­beaten at home since Fe­bru­ary and no longer look a soft touch, rais­ing hopes of a sus­tained chal­lenge for a top four fin­ish.</p>
    <p>Chris Wilder’s Blades have lost all four league games this sea­son, leav­ing them in the rel­e­ga­tion zone just weeks af­ter the con­clu­sion of their im­pres­sive first sea­son back in the top flight.</p>
    <p>Wilder, with­out new club-record sign­ing Rhian Brew­ster yes­ter­day, must have feared more mis­for­tune would be­fall his side when David Luiz es­caped with­out a red card when the Arsenal de­fender pulled back Oliver Burke as he sprinted clear in the open­ing minutes.</p>
    <p>That was a rare moment of drama in a tepid open­ing and for the first time in a Premier League match since last De­cem­ber, the first 28 minutes passed with­out a sin­gle shot from ei­ther team.</p>
    <p>Arteta has made no se­cret of his ad­mi­ra­tion for Wilder’s tac­tics and has been send­ing out Arsenal in a sim­i­lar fash­ion since tak­ing charge.</p>
    <p>The Spa­niard’s tac­tics ul­ti­mately proved su­pe­rior, but it was not un­til Pierre-Em­er­ick Aubameyang’s curl­ing long-range strike that forced a tip-over from Aaron Rams­dale that Arsenal sparked into life.</p>
    <p>Arteta’s side fi­nally broke the dead­lock in the 61st minute. Mo­hamed El­neny and Aubameyang com­bined to tee up Hec­tor Bel­lerin and his cross to the far post found Saka, who headed home.</p>
    <p>“All the things that have hap­pened to me – I feel blessed. I’m a happy man,” said the winger.</p>
    <p>“I don’t get a lot of head­ers but it fell per­fectly for me. I told Hec­tor what a cross it was.</p>
    <p>“It is the kind of pat­terns we work on. I am try­ing to do my best when the boss picks me. I try to re­pay the trust.”</p>
    <p>Arteta had sent on Pepe just be­fore the goal and the Ivory Coast winger made a rapid im­pact as he dou­bled the lead in the 64th minute.</p>
    <p>Bel­lerin slipped a pass to Pepe down the right flank and with the Blades’ de­fence back­ing off, he ad­vanced to the edge of the area be­fore guid­ing a com­posed low shot past Rams­dale at the cli­max of a flow­ing 19-pass move.</p>
    <p>“What I liked is we adapted to a very dif­fer­ent sce­nario,” Arteta said. “We had the right pa­tience. The team is evolv­ing in the right way in pos­ses­sion. We in­creased our ball speed, at­tacked with more pur­pose.”</p>
    <p>Like Arsenal, Wolves re­turned to win­ning ways in the top flight yes­ter­day, de­feat­ing Fulham 1-0 at Mo­lineux through Pe­dro Neto’s strike.</p>
    <p>MIKEL ARTETA, Arsenal man­ager on his Gun­ners side grind­ing out the 2-1 vic­tory over Sh­effield United de­spite not be­ing at their cus­tom­ary free-flow­ing best.</p>
