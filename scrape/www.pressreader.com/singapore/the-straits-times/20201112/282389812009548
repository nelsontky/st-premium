    <p>NO PA­TRONS, NO ROARS</p>
    <p>The most con­spic­u­ous dif­fer­ence will be the quiet, spec­ta­tor-less grounds through­out the week. This has been the norm in golf and other sports for months, but the Masters has a spe­cial re­la­tion­ship with its live au­di­ence, whose mem­bers are called “pa­trons”.</p>
    <p>An Au­gusta Na­tional course with­out pa­trons will look odd, but quan­ti­fy­ing a crowd’s im­pact is a chal­lenge, par­tic­u­larly on the back nine holes where Au­gusta’s famed roars have pro­vided the sound­track to the event’s most mem­o­rable fin­ishes. But not hav­ing to deal with the dis­trac­tions could also be an ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>THE WEATHER</p>
    <p>For all the con­cerns about a frigid Masters, tem­per­a­tures should ap­prox­i­mate April’s. In­stead, thun­der­storms will likely be a far greater threat than the tem­per­a­ture. Play­ers have said the course ap­pears to be play­ing longer and that chip­ping around the greens could be im­pacted if rain rolls across Au­gusta.</p>
    <p>FEWER AZA­LEAS, MORE FALL FO­LIAGE</p>
    <p>The tim­ing of the tour­na­ment lends it­self to dif­fer­ent play­ing con­di­tions and, for con­nois­seurs of Au­gusta Na­tional’s flora, a dif­fer­ent land­scape marked more by dog­woods and maples.</p>
    <p>The ropes and grand­stands are ab­sent this year, re­placed by dark painted lines to keep the hand­ful of peo­ple at the course out of play and there are some hints of au­tumn colour.</p>
    <p>Some shots, play­ers like Brooks Koepka have sug­gested, may be more tempt­ing be­cause they are more vis­i­ble be­cause of the lack of leaves or, in some spots, fans.</p>
    <p>A SPLIT TEE START</p>
    <p>With lim­ited day­light in Novem­ber, the Masters will use a twotee start for the first two rounds – play­ers will be­gin on the No. 1 and No. 10 tees in early and late morn­ing waves. The tour­na­ment used the rare two-tee start for the fi­nal round last year, when it raced to beat af­ter­noon thun­der­storms that had been fore­cast.</p>
