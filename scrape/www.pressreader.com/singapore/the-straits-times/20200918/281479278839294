    <p>Joseph School­ing may not have raced since the SEA Games in De­cem­ber – the long­est he has gone with­out com­pet­ing – but the 25-year-old Olympic cham­pion is not wor­ried about the lack of com­pe­ti­tion prac­tice.</p>
    <p>He told The Straits Times in a re­cent in­ter­view: “(Not rac­ing) is tough on one hand, but on the other hand I needed to change a lot of things and this has re­ally given me the time to do those things.</p>
    <p>“We’re start­ing to see some ex­cit­ing things so just the prospect of hav­ing that much time to get back into rac­ing.</p>
    <p>“I know how to race, so that isn’t the point, the point is get­ting to where I want to be phys­i­cally and men­tally to be able to race the way I want to. If I can do that, we’re go­ing to be in a good spot.”</p>
    <p>He had in Fe­bru­ary gone to Vir­ginia in the United States to train with for­mer coach Ser­gio Lopez, but re­turned to Sin­ga­pore in March due to the coron­avirus.</p>
    <p>Now train­ing at the Na­tional Train­ing Cen­tre (NTC), he is in the pro­cess of ap­ply­ing for his visa to re­unite with Lopez, and his de­par­ture date has not been con­firmed.</p>
    <p>“Def­i­nitely in the fore­see­able fu­ture... it’s also de­pen­dent on how the Covid cases are do­ing in Vir­ginia, but hope­fully sooner rather than later,” added School­ing, who is in “con­stant com­mu­ni­ca­tion” with Lopez.</p>
    <p>“I talk to him al­most ev­ery day, he texts me through prac­tice and the coaches at the NTC are all keep­ing Ser­gio up to date with my progress. We’ve got a good team around me.”</p>
    <p>He is con­fi­dent of be­ing able to “jump back into it pretty quickly” upon re­turn­ing to rac­ing, say­ing that his coaches at the NTC have been sim­u­lat­ing race en­vi­ron­ments here.</p>
    <p>“We’ve been do­ing a num­ber (of such sim­u­la­tions) and it’s all about get­ting reps in.</p>
    <p>“It’s go­ing to be tough rac­ing again, but at the same time that’s what we’re do­ing right now – try­ing to get as well-pre­pared as we can so we can let it rip when it’s time,” he added.</p>
    <p>“Rac­ing the guys (at the NTC) has been good, they keep me on my feet and I can see we’re all get­ting faster to­gether.”</p>
    <p>He has yet to equal or bet­ter his 100m but­ter­fly per­sonal best and Olympic record of 50.39 sec­onds, which he clocked en route to win­ning the ti­tle at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio.</p>
    <p>At last July’s world cham­pi­onships in Gwangju, he did not progress to the semi-fi­nals af­ter post­ing 52.93sec. The ti­tle was won by his for­mer Bolles School team­mate Caeleb Dres­sel, who set a world record (49.50sec) in the semi-fi­nal.</p>
    <p>School­ing re­tained his SEA Games crown in 51.84sec in the Philip­pines last year, where he won four of the six events he swam in.</p>
    <p>Asked if he is on the right track to­wards de­fend­ing his 100m but­ter­fly Olympic ti­tle at the post­poned Games in Tokyo next year, he said: “It’s hard to just quan­tify it as be­ing yes or no. We’ve def­i­nitely taken some steps in the right di­rec­tion and be­cause of that, we’re on a bet­ter plat­form to do the things I want to do in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“Some (im­prove­ments) hap­pen faster than oth­ers, but for the most part, we’re on the right track.”</p>
    <p>ON THE RIGHT PATH</p>
    <p>We’ve def­i­nitely taken some steps in the right di­rec­tion and be­cause of that, we’re on a bet­ter plat­form to do the things I want to do in the fu­ture. Some (im­prove­ments) hap­pen faster than oth­ers, but for the most part, we’re on the right track. ’’</p>
