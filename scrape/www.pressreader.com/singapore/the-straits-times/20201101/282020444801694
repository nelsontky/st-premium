    <p>When Madam Lim Ee Chin, 81, re­alised that her neigh­bour’s flat was on fire, she rushed to help put it out with­out a sec­ond thought.</p>
    <p>Alarmed by the bil­low­ing, acrid smoke and the sound of sev­eral loud ex­plo­sions, she dragged buck­ets of wa­ter from her bath­room and passed them to her next-door neigh­bour Aisyah Vil­le­gas to put out the flames.</p>
    <p>She never once con­sid­ered her curved spine and heart trou­ble.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing in Man­darin, Madam Lim said: “I was wor­ried that if their house burnt down, they would have no place to stay.”</p>
    <p>She was also afraid the fire would spread to her flat.</p>
    <p>Wor­ried about Madam Lim’s safety, her sis­ter Loh Guet Wah, 68, who lives with her, said she tried to get her to leave the flat, but Madam Lim re­fused.</p>
    <p>Both women are not mar­ried.</p>
    <p>For her courage, Madam Lim is one of the nom­i­nees for The Straits Times Sin­ga­porean of the Year award this year.</p>
    <p>The se­nior cit­i­zen was watch­ing TV in the liv­ing room of her 12th­storey flat in Block 917 Jurong West Street 91 at about 11.20pm on Aug 9, when the fire broke out next door.</p>
    <p>Madam Lim, with the help of other neigh­bours, put out most of the fire be­fore fire­fight­ers from the Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force (SCDF) ar­rived. Af­ter they left, she spent the next few hours mop­ping up her flat.</p>
    <p>For her ef­forts, she be­came the old­est re­cip­i­ent of the SCDF Com­mu­nity First Re­spon­der Award on Aug 27. The award is given to mem­bers of the pub­lic who lend a hand to those in trou­ble.</p>
    <p>SCDF, in a Face­book post on Sept 10, said: “De­spite her age, she did not hes­i­tate to help put out the fire... Madam Lim’s ac­tion ex­em­pli­fied brav­ery and in her own words, the kam­pung spirit.”</p>
    <p>It added that her ac­tions helped cut down on the dam­age and in­juries caused by the fire.</p>
    <p>Her neigh­bours showed their ap­pre­ci­a­tion by giv­ing her moon­cakes and a pat­terned mask.</p>
    <p>Since the blaze, three of the five peo­ple liv­ing in the flat that caught fire have moved out, and Madam Lim misses chat­ting with them in the cor­ri­dor, where she of­ten saw them, she said.</p>
    <p>Af­ter work­ing in a tin fac­tory for 36 years, Madam Lim re­tired two years ago and now spends most of her time at home, go­ing out mainly to buy food and visit the doc­tor.</p>
    <p>Madam Loh, who does ad­min­is­tra­tive work for an au­dit firm, said her mother adopted Madam Lim at a young age, but her sis­ter did not change her sur­name.</p>
    <p>Said Madam Loh: “When I am not feel­ing well, she will buy food for me. I’m veg­e­tar­ian, so it’s harder to find food I can eat, but she will go and look for it.”</p>
    <p>She said that when they were chil­dren, Madam Lim would take her and their other five sib­lings on ex­cur­sions to places like Haw Par Villa and the Botanic Gar­dens.</p>
    <p>“She helped to raise me,” said Madam Loh.</p>
