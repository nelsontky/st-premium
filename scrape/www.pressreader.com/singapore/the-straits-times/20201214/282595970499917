    <p>•</p>
    <p>MADRID Real Madrid coach Zine­dine Zidane said the club used the crit­i­cism thrown at them in re­cent weeks to their ad­van­tage in an em­phatic 2-0 La Liga home win over crosstown ri­vals Atletico Madrid on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Less than two weeks ago, the hosts were reel­ing from shock de­feats by Alaves and Shakhtar Donetsk, with a triple test against Sevilla, Borus­sia Monchengla­d­bach and Atletico on the hori­zon.</p>
    <p>But with Zidane’s fu­ture on the line, they have risen to the oc­ca­sion, win­ning all three matches in a re­turn to the form that saw them rack up 10 straight vic­to­ries en route to win­ning the La Liga ti­tle last sea­son.</p>
    <p>Real are now in third, three points be­hind l ead­ers Atletico (26), and de­spite hav­ing played a game more, have mo­men­tum af­ter end­ing their ri­vals’ un­beaten league run go­ing back to Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>“We have been hurt by some of the things that have been said but they have made us stronger,” Zidane said af­ter Casemiro and Jan Oblak’s own goal gave his side brag­ging rights in the Madrid derby.</p>
    <p>“Crit­i­cism is part of foot­ball and you have to learn how to cope with it. But the most im­por­tant thing is that we be­lieve in what we are do­ing. And to­day, we proved Real Madrid know how to play.”</p>
    <p>The French­man also gave spe­cial men­tion to his mid­field pair of Toni Kroos and Luka Mo­dric, who he said were in the same form as when they led Madrid to three con­sec­u­tive Cham­pi­ons League ti­tles.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he em­pha­sised that Real still had a lot of work to do to main­tain con­sis­tency, adding: “I’m happy with ev­ery­thing we did in the game. We pressed them all over the pitch and didn’t Atletico into the game.</p>
    <p>“We built on the last two games and com­peted very well for the ma­jor­ity of the game. But there’s noth­ing to cel­e­brate be­cause we haven’t won any­thing yet.”</p>
    <p>While he was eu­phoric, his coun­ter­part Diego Sime­one was down­cast af­ter the vis­i­tors, who were the last un­beaten team in the let league, were thor­oughly beaten at the Al­fredo di Ste­fano Sta­dium.</p>
    <p>“To­day we played very badly, the coach did not have the lu­cid­ity to in­ter­pret the game bet­ter and the team did not do what was asked of them,” he said. “I’ll take some im­por­tant lessons from the de­feat, there are ar­eas I need to im­prove in as a coach as they were far su­pe­rior to us.”</p>
