    <p>Af­ter be­ing a pre­sen­ter on Money FM 89.3 for more than two years, ra­dio vet­eran Bernard Lim will go off the air to take on a new role as the pro­gramme di­rec­tor of sis­ter sta­tions Kiss92 FM and One FM 91.3.</p>
    <p>All three sta­tions are run by SPH Ra­dio.</p>
    <p>He re­places Mr Jamie Mel­drum, who died of nat­u­ral causes at the age of 50 in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Lim hosted his l ast show on Money FM 89.3 yes­ter­day and will start his new po­si­tion on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“No­body ex­pected what hap­pened to Jamie – we’re all quite shocked,” he says. “The two sta­tions have been han­dled very well by him and, mov­ing on, we will con­tinue to do what Jamie has done. But we will also think about how to make some im­prove­ments.”</p>
    <p>Lim is no stranger to ra­dio man­age­ment. He first made his name in 1992 as a DJ on the Me­di­a­corp ra­dio sta­tion now known as 987, and be­came pro­gram­ming man­ager at Class 95 in 1996.</p>
    <p>He later be­came vice-pres­i­dent of in­te­grated me­dia plan­ning and man­ag­ing di­rec­tor for tele­vi­sion in the com­pany.</p>
    <p>He also spent time in the nightlife and en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try as chief ex­ec­u­tive of en­ter­tain­ment group LifeBrandz.</p>
    <p>In 2014, he suf­fered a stroke and had to un­dergo two oper­a­tions. He has since fully re­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>When he joined Money FM as a pre­sen­ter in 2018, it was his first time go­ing on the air in more than two decades.</p>
    <p>While he is fa­mil­iar with many of the sea­soned pre­sen­ters who used to work with him in Me­di­a­corp – in­clud­ing One FM’s Glenn Ong and the Fly­ing Dutch­man, as well as Kiss92’s Maddy Bar­ber – Lim ac­knowl­edges that the ra­dio scene has changed a lot since the 1990s.</p>
    <p>He says: “Ra­dio is not what it used to be. Lis­ten­ers to­day have a lot of other dis­trac­tions. So I see this role as a new chal­lenge and I’m look­ing for­ward to tak­ing on that chal­lenge.”</p>
    <p>He will be work­ing closely with the per­son­al­i­ties from the two sta­tions, he adds. “I need to un­der­stand their mind­set and re­ally help them im­prove their per­for­mance.”</p>
    <p>A key fo­cus will be on the new team that helms Kiss 92’s morn­ing show, com­pris­ing DJs Bar­ber, Di­vian Nair and pre­sen­ter and ex­ec­u­tive pro­ducer An­dre Hoe­den, pre­vi­ously from One FM.</p>
    <p>For­mer Kiss 92 DJ Jason John­son left the team in late Au­gust to “pur­sue other per­sonal in­ter­ests”, says Lim.</p>
