    <p>WILM­ING­TON • US Pres­i­den­t­elect Joe Bi­den wel­comed Mr Don­ald Trump’s an­nounce­ment that he will not at­tend the Jan 20 in­au­gu­ra­tion, call­ing it a “good thing”.</p>
    <p>“I was told on the way over here that he in­di­cated he wasn’t go­ing to show up at the in­au­gu­ra­tion,” Mr Bi­den told re­porters in Wilm­ing­ton, Delaware.</p>
    <p>“One of the few things he and I have ever agreed on,” Mr Bi­den said.</p>
    <p>“It’s a good thing, him not show­ing up. He’s been an em­bar­rass­ment to the coun­try,” Mr Bi­den pointed out.</p>
    <p>“He’s not fit to serve,” he added of Mr Trump, who is fac­ing a pos­si­bil­ity of be­ing im­peached this week for in­cit­ing his sup­port­ers to storm the US Capi­tol in Wash­ing­ton last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“He ex­ceeded even my worst no­tions about him,” Mr Bi­den said.</p>
    <p>“He’s one of the most in­com­pe­tent pres­i­dents in the his­tory of the United States of Amer­ica.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den added that Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence would be wel­come at his in­au­gu­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s re­marks came af­ter Mr Trump tweeted ear­lier on Fri­day that he would not at­tend the in­au­gu­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>“To all of those who have asked, I will not be go­ing to the in­au­gu­ra­tion on Jan 20,” he said.</p>
    <p>It re­mains un­clear if Mr Pence will at­tend the cer­e­mony, which is ex­pected to take place un­der height­ened se­cu­rity af­ter the deadly siege of the Capi­tol last week and with heavy pre­cau­tions to pre­vent the spread of the coron­avirus.</p>
    <p>Mr Pence has sig­nalled his will­ing­ness to at­tend, an ad­min­is­tra­tion source said, but added that he had yet to re­ceive a for­mal in­vi­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Only three pres­i­dents have skipped their suc­ces­sor’s swear­ing-in: John Adams in 1801; his son John Quincy Adams in 1829; and An­drew John­son, a Demo­crat who sat out the 1869 in­au­gu­ra­tion of Repub­li­can Ulysses S. Grant.</p>
