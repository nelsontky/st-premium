    <p>NEW YORK • The cen­tral, be­fud­dling eco­nomic re­al­ity of the United States at the close of last year is that ev­ery­thing is ter­ri­ble in the world, while ev­ery­thing is won­der­ful in the fi­nan­cial mar­kets.</p>
    <p>It is a macabre spec­ta­cle. As­set prices keep reach­ing new, ex­tra­or­di­nary highs, when around 3,000 peo­ple a day are dy­ing of the coro­n­avirus and 800,000 peo­ple a week are fil­ing new un­em­ploy­ment claims. Even an en­thu­si­ast of modern cap­i­tal­ism might won­der if some­thing is deeply bro­ken in how the econ­omy works.</p>
    <p>To bet­ter un­der­stand this strange mix of buoy­ant mar­kets and eco­nomic de­spair, it is worth turn­ing to the data. As it hap­pens, the num­bers of­fer a co­her­ent nar­ra­tive about how the US ar­rived at this point – one with lessons about how pol­icy, mar­kets and the econ­omy in­ter­sect – and re­veal the sharp dis­par­ity be­tween the pan­demic year’s haves and have-nots.</p>
    <p>IN­COME</p>
    <p>It starts, as so many epic tales do, with a ta­ble of data from the Na­tional In­come and Prod­uct Ac­counts – namely, “Per­sonal In­come and Its Dis­po­si­tion, Monthly”.</p>
    <p>This re­port cap­tures how Amer­i­cans are earn­ing and spend­ing, two ac­tiv­i­ties that the coro­n­avirus dras­ti­cally al­tered last year.</p>
    <p>By com­bin­ing the num­bers from March through Novem­ber (the lat­est avail­able) and com­par­ing them with the same pe­riod in 2019, we can see more clearly the pan­demic’s whip­saw ef­fects.</p>
    <p>The first im­por­tant ob­ser­va­tion: Salaries and wages fell less, in the ag­gre­gate, than even a care­ful ob­server of the econ­omy might think.</p>
    <p>To­tal em­ployee com­pen­sa­tion was down only 0.5 per cent for those nine months, more akin to a mild re­ces­sion than an eco­nomic catas­tro­phe.</p>
    <p>That might seem im­pos­si­ble. Large swathes of the econ­omy have been shut down; mil­lions are out of work. The num­ber of jobs em­ploy­ers re­ported hav­ing on their pay­rolls was down 6.1 per cent in Novem­ber com­pared with a year ear­lier, ac­cord­ing to sep­a­rate Labour Depart­ment data.</p>
    <p>So how can the num­ber of jobs be down 6 per cent but em­ployee com­pen­sa­tion be down only 0.5 per cent? It has to do with which jobs have been lost. The mil­lions of peo­ple no longer work­ing be­cause of the pan­demic were dis­pro­por­tion­ately in lower-pay­ing ser­vice jobs.</p>
    <p>Higher-pay­ing pro­fes­sional jobs were more likely to be un­af­fected, and a hand­ful of other sec­tors have been boom­ing, such as ware­hous­ing and gro­cery stores, lead­ing to higher in­comes for those work­ers.</p>
    <p>For all the at­tacks on the coro­n­avirus re­lief Bill that Congress passed in late March, the de­gree to which it served to sup­port the in­comes of Amer­i­cans, es­pe­cially</p>
    <p>those who lost jobs, is ex­tra­or­di­nary.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­cans’ in­come from un­em­ploy­ment in­surance ben­e­fits was 25 times higher from March through Novem­ber last year than in the same pe­riod of 2019.</p>
    <p>That partly re­flects that mil­lions more job­less peo­ple were seek­ing ben­e­fits, of course.</p>
    <p>But it also re­flects a US$600 (S$790) weekly sup­ple­ment to job­less ben­e­fits that the Act in­cluded through late July – along with a pro­gramme to sup­port free­lance and con­tract work­ers who lost jobs and who oth­er­wise would have been in­el­i­gi­ble for ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, un­em­ploy­ment in­surance pro­grammes pumped US$499 bil­lion more into Amer­i­cans’ pock­ets from March to Novem­ber than the pre­vi­ous year; US$365 bil­lion of it was a re­sult of the ex­pan­sion in the coro­n­avirus re­lief Bill.</p>
    <p>The US$1,200 cheques to most US house­holds that were in­cluded in that leg­is­la­tion con­trib­uted a fur­ther US$276 bil­lion to per­sonal in­come – much of which ac­crued to fam­i­lies that did not ex­pe­ri­ence a drop in earn­ings.</p>
    <p>And the law’s sig­na­ture pro­gramme to en­cour­age busi­nesses</p>
    <p>to keep peo­ple on their pay­rolls, the Pay­cheque Pro­tec­tion Pro­gramme (PPP), pre­vented a col­lapse in “pro­pri­etor’s in­come” – prof­its that ac­crued to own­ers of busi­nesses and farms. This in­come rose nar­rowly, by US$29 bil­lion, but would have fallen by US$143 bil­lion if not for the PPP and a coro­n­avirus food as­sis­tance pro­gramme. These are re­mark­able num­bers. When it is all tal­lied up, Amer­i­cans’ cu­mu­la­tive af­ter-tax per­sonal in­come was US$1.03 tril­lion higher from March to Novem­ber last year than in 2019, an in­crease of more than 8 per cent.</p>
    <p>Some of the pes­simism among eco­nomic fore­cast­ers (and jour­nal­ists) in the spring re­flected a fail­ure to un­der­stand just how large and in­flu­en­tial those stim­u­lus pay­ments would turn out to be.</p>
    <p>But in­come also is only part of the story. Big changes last year also took place on the other side of the ledger: spend­ing.</p>
    <p>SPEND­ING</p>
    <p>By turn­ing to an­other rivet­ing story, “Per­sonal Con­sump­tion Ex­pen­di­tures by Ma­jor Type of Prod­uct, Monthly”, we see a pat­tern that may seem ob­vi­ous with hind</p>
    <p>sight but was not as easy to pre­dict while the econ­omy was col­laps­ing dur­ing the spring.</p>
    <p>The ob­vi­ous part was a de­cline in spend­ing on ser­vices.</p>
    <p>All those restau­rant reser­va­tions never made, flights not taken, and sports and con­cert tick­ets not bought added up to se­ri­ous money.</p>
    <p>Ser­vices spend­ing fell by US$575 bil­lion, or nearly 8 per cent.</p>
    <p>Less ob­vi­ous were some of the other pat­terns af­fect­ing con­sumer spend­ing in a pan­demic. Amer­i­cans spent mean­ing­ful dol­lars – those they would not or could not spend on ser­vices – on stuff.</p>
    <p>Durable goods spend­ing was up by US$60 bil­lion (a bet­ter chair for work­ing from home, or maybe a new bi­cy­cle), while non-durable goods spend­ing rose by US$39 bil­lion (think of the bour­bon pur­chased for con­sump­tion at home that in an al­ter­nate uni­verse would have been logged as “ser­vices” con­sump­tion in a bar).</p>
    <p>But the ex­tra spend­ing on stuff did not ex­ceed the drop in spend­ing on ser­vices.</p>
    <p>And, thanks to lower rates, house­holds’ per­sonal in­ter­est pay­ments and other miscellane­ous out­lays dropped by US$59 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Not only were US house­holds, in the ag­gre­gate, tak­ing in more money, but they were also spend­ing less of it. To­tal out­lays fell by US$535 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>SAV­INGS</p>
    <p>This com­bi­na­tion of soar­ing per­sonal in­come and fall­ing spend­ing pushed Amer­i­cans’ sav­ings rate through the roof.</p>
    <p>From March through Novem­ber, per­sonal sav­ings were US$1.56 tril­lion higher than in 2019, a rise of 173 per cent. Nor­mally, the sav­ings rate bounces around in a nar­row range, around 7 per cent just be­fore the pan­demic. It spiked to 33.7 per cent in April, its high­est level on record dat­ing to 1959.</p>
    <p>Even as mil­lions of in­di­vid­u­als faced great fi­nan­cial hard­ship last year, Amer­i­cans in the ag­gre­gate were build­ing sav­ings at a star­tling rate. It had to go some­where.</p>
    <p>But where? Hold­ing on to ex­tra cash was one op­tion – and sure enough, cur­rency in cir­cu­la­tion has spiked by US$260 bil­lion since Fe­bru­ary, a 14 per cent in­crease.</p>
    <p>De­posits in com­mer­cial banks are way up – by 19 per cent since the first week of March.</p>
    <p>Or, for those a lit­tle more com­fort­able with risk, there was in­vest­ing in stocks, which helps ex­plain the 16 per cent rise in the S&P 500 In­dex for last year.</p>
    <p>For those com­fort­able with a lot of risk – and with tak­ing ad­van­tage of the mar­ket’s momentum – there was buy­ing a mar­ket dar­ling stock like Tesla or trad­ing op­tions.</p>
    <p>Or you could have used the oc­ca­sion of the pan­demic to buy a new house. Home sales surged, and the S&P Core­L­ogic na­tional home price in­dex was up 8.4 per cent in Oc­to­ber from a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Es­sen­tially, the rise in sav­ings among the peo­ple who have avoided ma­jor eco­nomic dam­age from the pan­demic is cre­at­ing a tide lift­ing the val­ues of nearly all fi­nan­cial as­sets.</p>
    <p>Cer­tainly, the Fed­eral Re­serve plays a role. The cen­tral bank has low­ered in­ter­est rates to nearly zero, promised to keep them there for years, bought govern­ment debt and sup­ported cor­po­rate bond mar­kets.</p>
    <p>But the surge in as­set prices has made its way into many sec­tors far from any form of Fed sup­port, like stocks and bit­coin. And the surge had, if any­thing, ac­cel­er­ated this au­tumn de­spite a lack of ad­di­tional stim­u­la­tive ac­tion from the Fed.</p>
    <p>The Fed played a big part in engi­neer­ing the sta­bil­i­sa­tion of the mar­kets in March and April, but the rally since then prob­a­bly re­flects these broader dy­nam­ics around sav­ings.</p>
    <p>Just be­cause one can ex­plain these mar­ket gains does not mean that high as­set prices will hold.</p>
    <p>One could tell a story in which the econ­omy roars back as peo­ple are vac­ci­nated, and the en­tire pat­tern re­verses it­self, with the sav­ings rate turn­ing neg­a­tive as Amer­i­cans spend down their stock­piled wealth on trips and other lux­u­ries that were off-lim­its last year.</p>
    <p>It could spur in­fla­tion, which, if se­vere enough, could cause the Fed to back off its easy money ap­proach sooner than peo­ple now think.</p>
    <p>But this year’s eco­nomic nar­ra­tive has yet to be writ­ten – and if last year teaches one thing, it is that the story arc is more un­pre­dictable than you might think.</p>
    <p>Es­sen­tially, the rise in sav­ings among the peo­ple who have avoided ma­jor eco­nomic dam­age from the pan­demic is cre­at­ing a tide lift­ing the val­ues of nearly all fi­nan­cial as­sets.</p>
