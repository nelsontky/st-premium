    <p>Malaysian glove maker Top Glove will sus­pend op­er­a­tions at 28 of its fac­to­ries in Klang, Se­lan­gor, af­ter more than two thou­sand em­ploy­ees tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter (Se­cu­rity clus­ter) Is­mail Sabri Yaakob yes­ter­day said the clo­sure would al­low for the test­ing and quar­an­tin­ing of work­ers at the world’s largest dis­pos­able glove man­u­fac­turer.</p>
    <p>“I am made to un­der­stand that to­day alone, there are 1,067 pos­i­tive cases. On the ad­vice of the health min­istry, to­day’s meet­ing has agreed to close these 28 Top Glove fac­to­ries in Klang in stages to en­able the work­ers to un­dergo test­ing and quar­an­tine,” the min­is­ter told a news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>More than 1,800 pos­i­tive cases had been recorded as of yes­ter­day, he added.</p>
    <p>Health di­rec­tor-gen­eral Noor Hisham Ab­dul­lah told a sep­a­rate news con­fer­ence later that a to­tal of 5,767 people in the Top Glove fac­tory-linked clus­ter have been tested and 2,524 of them were con­firmed to have Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Of these, 2,453 pa­tients are fac­tory work­ers, while 71 are close con­tacts, in­clud­ing a two-year-old.</p>
    <p>Most of those in­fected, or 2,360 of them, are non-cit­i­zens and the re­main­ing 164 are Malaysians.</p>
    <p>Top Glove’s worker dor­mi­to­ries in Klang and its sur­round­ing ar­eas are un­der the en­hanced move­ment con­trol or­der (Emco).</p>
    <p>The re­stric­tions, in ef­fect un­til the end of this month, kicked in af­ter 215 Covid-19 cases were re­ported on Nov 15.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Emco, no one is al­lowed to en­ter or leave the area for 14 days while health officials con­duct in­tense screen­ings. Food and medicines are dis­trib­uted to people in the lock­down area.</p>
    <p>While the Emco on Top Glove’s dor­mi­to­ries in­volves some 5,900 work­ers, Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham noted that the glove maker em­ployed around 13,000 work­ers, in­clud­ing those who live out­side the lock­down area.</p>
    <p>Nine of Malaysia’s 13 states and its three fed­eral ter­ri­to­ries – Kuala Lumpur, Pu­tra­jaya and Labuan – are un­der a par­tial lock­down called con­di­tional MCO (CMCO) as the gov­ern­ment tries to bring un­der con­trol a third wave of Covid-19 cases in the past two months.</p>
    <p>Un­der the CMCO, in­ter-dis­trict travel is re­stricted to emer­gen­cies or for work, and mass gath­er­ings are banned.</p>
    <p>Malaysia reg­is­tered a new daily high of 1,884 Covid-19 in­fec­tions yes­ter­day. There were two new deaths, tak­ing the toll to 337. Pre­vi­ously, the record for in­fec­tions in a sin­gle day was 1,755, on Nov 6.</p>
    <p>Se­lan­gor recorded the most cases out of all states, with 1,203 in­fec­tions. Sabah recorded 289 cases, while Kuala Lumpur saw 196 cases.</p>
    <p>Top Glove makes 220 mil­lion dis­pos­able rub­ber gloves daily, and the com­pany’s value has mul­ti­plied by at least six times this year – mak­ing it the sec­ond-largest listed com­pany in Malaysia – due to a sharp in­crease in de­mand dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Shares in the com­pany fell 10 per cent on Nov 17, af­ter the tight­ened move­ment curbs were first an­nounced.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the counter rose marginally from Friday’s clos­ing, fol­low­ing its list­ing on the Dow Jones Sus­tain­abil­ity In­dices un­der the Emerg­ing Mar­kets cat­e­gory.</p>
