    <p>The plan to de­merge Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries and Sem­b­corp Ma­rine (Sem­bMarine) will meet the loss­mak­ing ma­rine unit’s “crit­i­cal” liq­uid­ity needs, strengthen both com­pa­nies’ fi­nan­cial po­si­tions and is in the best in­ter­est of share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>This is ac­cord­ing to the com­pa­nies’ boards and man­age­ment teams as they re­sponded yesterday to ques­tions from the Se­cu­ri­ties In­vestors As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore), or Sias.</p>
    <p>Last month, the two firms pro­posed a $2.1 bil­lion re­cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion for Sem­bMarine as well as a de­merger from each other, which will re­sult in Te­masek hav­ing a di­rect stake in the ma­rine arm.</p>
    <p>Sias had asked, among other things, why they were un­der­tak­ing the cor­po­rate ac­tion now, while economic con­di­tions were poor.</p>
    <p>The com­pa­nies yesterday replied that they had ear­lier been ex­plor­ing mul­ti­ple options to re­cap­i­talise Sem­bMarine. The trans­ac­tion was then pro­posed shortly after both the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion and the sudden drop in oil prices had trig­gered the im­me­di­ate need for funds.</p>
    <p>DE­CID­ING SAY</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Sem­bMarine clar­i­fied that its in­de­pen­dent share­hold­ers will have the de­cid­ing say in whether the rights is­sue will pro­ceed.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause th­ese share­hold­ers will be the only ones vot­ing on the white­wash res­o­lu­tion waiv­ing rights to a gen­eral of­fer by Te­masek, which is in­ter-con­di­tional with the rights is­sue res­o­lu­tion. If the white­wash res­o­lu­tion is not ap­proved, the rights is­sue will not pro­ceed even if its res­o­lu­tion was ap­proved.</p>
    <p>Sias had asked how the pro­posal’s struc­ture gives Sem­bMarine’s pub­lic share­hold­ers an ac­tual say in the mat­ter, given that Sem­b­corp owns 61 per cent of Sem­bMarine and has un­der­taken to vote in favour of the rights is­sue, which re­quires a sim­ple ma­jor­ity to be green­lit.</p>
    <p>All Sem­b­corp direc­tors who hold shares in Sem­bMarine will ab­stain from vot­ing on the white­wash res­o­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>REFINANCIN­G</p>
    <p>Sem­bMarine also said that con­tin­u­ing to add debt is not a long-term solution, as this will fur­ther bur­den its balance sheet with higher gear­ing and in­ter­est pay­ments at a time when its cash flow and fi­nan­cial flex­i­bil­ity are still con­strained by the “chal­leng­ing mar­ket dy­nam­ics and out­look”.</p>
    <p>The group’s cur­rent balance sheet is al­ready highly geared, and ob­tain­ing sup­port from banks to main­tain its cur­rent loan fa­cil­i­ties is al­ready “chal­leng­ing”, it noted.</p>
    <p>“To re­quest banks to pro­vide ad­di­tional loan fa­cil­i­ties is there­fore not re­al­is­tic and also un­likely to be suf­fi­cient to meet our liq­uid­ity needs.”</p>
    <p>This was in re­sponse to Sias’ ques­tion as to whether Sem­bMarine would con­sider tak­ing on new debt given that in­ter­est rates have fallen sub­stan­tially in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>‘A NEW WAY FOR­WARD’</p>
    <p>If ap­proved, the rights is­sue will al­low Sem­bMarine to “chart a new way for­ward” by im­prov­ing its cash po­si­tion and strength­en­ing the balance sheet. It will en­able the firm to fund on­go­ing com­mit­ments, help the group com­pete for new high­value projects and en­sure longterm vi­a­bil­ity, it said.</p>
    <p>Un­der “gen­eral cor­po­rate pur­poses”, the group will also use some of the $600 mil­lion raised to fund its re­search and de­vel­op­ment ef­forts, and strengthen core en­gi­neer­ing and ex­e­cu­tion ca­pa­bil­i­ties that will drive fu­ture growth ini­tia­tives.</p>
    <p>In the im­me­di­ate term, Sem­bMarine will fo­cus on com­plet­ing on­go­ing projects. To date, none of them has been can­celled.</p>
    <p>Over the longer term, the com­pany will di­ver­sify into clean en­ergy growth ar­eas, such as off­shore wind, and ex­pand into its es­tab­lished seg­ments, such as the gas value chain.</p>
    <p>While all of Sem­bMarine busi­ness seg­ments have been af­fected by the cur­rent chal­leng­ing busi­ness con­di­tions, the re­pair and up­grades seg­ment has re­mained prof­itable and gen­er­ated over $600 mil­lion in rev­enue for FY2019. Sem­bMarine said it will con­tinue to grow this seg­ment.</p>
    <p>SUBORDINAT­ED LOAN</p>
    <p>Sem­b­corp clar­i­fied that un­der the pro­posal, it will not “write off” the $1.5 bil­lion out­stand­ing prin­ci­pal loaned to Sem­bMarine. In­stead, the debt will be con­verted into an eq­uity stake in Sem­bMarine via the rights is­sue.</p>
    <p>Sias had asked how writ­ing off a re­lated party’s debt will ben­e­fit Sem­b­corp. If the debt were in­deed writ­ten off, Sem­b­corp would not have re­ceived any con­sid­er­a­tion in re­turn.</p>
    <p>The loan set­tle­ment through the rights is­sue sub­stan­tially re­cap­i­talises Sem­bMarine’s busi­ness, ma­te­ri­ally re­duces its debt ser­vic­ing obli­ga­tions and puts it in a strong po­si­tion to ride out the cur­rent cri­sis, said Sem­b­corp.</p>
    <p>It added that the set­tle­ment also pro­vides value to Sem­b­corp, in the form of Sem­bMarine shares. All Sem­b­corp share­hold­ers will ben­e­fit as well, as they will get the flex­i­bil­ity to cal­i­brate their hold­ings in both com­pa­nies once there is a clean de­merger after the loan set­tle­ment and dis­tri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>BALANCE SHEET</p>
    <p>Sias ar­gued that Sem­b­corp’s re­duced debt post-trans­ac­tion may be driven by ac­count­ing treat­ment rather than ex­pected economic im­prove­ments to its busi­ness.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, the com­pany pointed out that a de­con­sol­i­da­tion of Sem­bMarine will bring “tan­gi­ble” ben­e­fits, as the im­proved debt po­si­tion will open up op­por­tu­ni­ties for more debt fi­nanc­ing, and is not sim­ply ac­count­ing treat­ment.</p>
    <p>If the trans­ac­tion goes through, Sem­b­corp will no longer need to set aside the re­main­ing $500 mil­lion com­mit­ment un­der the $2 bil­lion subordinat­ed loan, given that this re­main­ing com­mit­ment will be can­celled.</p>
    <p>With a less con­strained balance sheet, Sem­b­corp said it will be bet­ter placed to pur­sue some of the op­por­tu­ni­ties to serve Asian mar­kets where there is bur­geon­ing de­mand for sus­tain­able en­ergy so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>Sem­b­corp also replied that the de­merger will de­liver a “clearer in­vest­ment propo­si­tion” to its share­hold­ers, and this may lead to a pos­i­tive re-rat­ing of its eq­uity value and ap­peal to eq­uity in­vestors fo­cused on the en­ergy and ur­ban space.</p>
    <p>Sias had asked for specifics on the ex­pected im­prove­ment to share­holder value when Sem­b­corp trans­forms into a fo­cused en­ergy and ur­ban com­pany.</p>
    <p>The two com­pa­nies will seek their share­hold­ers’ ap­proval for the pro­posal at ex­tra­or­di­nary gen­eral meet­ings ex­pected to take place around end-Au­gust and early Septem­ber.</p>
