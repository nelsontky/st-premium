    <p>BRASILIA • De­for­esta­tion in Brazil’s Ama­zon rain­for­est surged to a 12-year high this year, of­fi­cial gov­ern­ment data showed on Mon­day, with de­struc­tion soar­ing since Pres­i­dent Jair Bol­sonaro took of­fice and amid weak­ened en­vi­ron­men­tal en­force­ment.</p>
    <p>This year, de­struc­tion of the world’s largest rain­for­est rose 9.5 per cent from a year ear­lier to 11,088 sq km – seven times the size of Lon­don – ac­cord­ing to data from Brazil’s na­tional space re­search agency Inpe.</p>
    <p>That means Brazil will miss its own tar­get, es­tab­lished un­der a 2009 cli­mate change law, for re­duc­ing de­for­esta­tion to roughly 3,900 sq km.</p>
    <p>The con­se­quences for miss­ing the tar­get are not laid out in the law, but could leave the gov­ern­ment open to law­suits.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cial an­nual mea­sure, known as PRODES, is taken by com­par­ing satel­lite im­ages from the end of July this year with those from the be­gin­ning of Au­gust last year. Th­ese dates are cho­sen to co­in­cide with the Ama­zon’s dry sea­son, when there is less cloud cover to in­ter­fere with cal­cu­la­tions.</p>
    <p>The Ama­zon is the world’s largest rain­for­est and its pro­tec­tion is cru­cial to stop­ping cat­a­strophic cli­mate change be­cause of the vast amount of car­bon diox­ide it ab­sorbs. The lat­est an­nual de­struc­tion is a sub­stan­tial in­crease from the 7,536 sq km that were de­for­ested in 2018, the year be­fore Mr Bol­sonaro took of­fice.</p>
    <p>While en­vi­ron­men­tal­ists blamed the gov­ern­ment for the rise, fed­eral of­fi­cials hailed the fig­ures as a sign of progress in fight­ing de­for­esta­tion, as the in­crease was far lower than the 34 per cent in­crease recorded last year.</p>
    <p>“While we are not here to cel­e­brate this, it does sig­nify that the ef­forts we are mak­ing are be­gin­ning to bear fruit,” Vice-Pres­i­dent Hamil­ton Mourao told re­porters at Inpe head­quar­ters in the Sao Paulo satel­lite city of Sao Jose dos Cam­pos.</p>
    <p>Mr Bol­sonaro has weak­ened the en­vi­ron­men­tal en­force­ment agency Ibama and called for in­tro­duc­ing more com­mer­cial farm­ing and min­ing in the Ama­zon re­gion, ar­gu­ing it will lift the re­gion out of poverty.</p>
    <p>En­vi­ron­men­tal ad­vo­cates say this has em­bold­ened il­le­gal ranch­ers, min­ers and land grab­bers to clear the for­est.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent’s main pol­icy re­sponse to global out­cry over Ama­zon de­struc­tion has been to send in the mil­i­tary, who were first de­ployed last year and are ex­pected to re­main in the re­gion fight­ing de­for­esta­tion and for­est fires through next April.</p>
    <p>Mr Mourao said the gov­ern­ment is plan­ning fur­ther mea­sures to com­bat de­for­esta­tion af­ter the mil­i­tary op­er­a­tion ends in April, with­out giv­ing de­tails. He said the gov­ern­ment must work within its cur­rently tight bud­get con­straints.</p>
    <p>The elec­tion of Mr Joe Bi­den as United States pres­i­dent has raised the pos­si­bil­ity that the US will ramp up pres­sure on Brazil over the rain­for­est. Mr Bi­den had said in a de­bate that the world should of­fer Brazil money to fund ef­forts to stop de­for­esta­tion, and threat­ened eco­nomic con­se­quences against Brazil if it did not.</p>
    <p>In the western US, the yearly land area burned by se­vere wild­fires has grown eight times larger in less than four decades, re­searchers said on Mon­day, warn­ing that higher tem­per­a­tures and drier con­di­tions are threat­en­ing ir­repara­ble for­est loss.</p>
    <p>Some 84,900ha burned in 2017, up from 10,520ha in 1985, in high sever­ity fires that killed more than 95 per cent of trees in their path, ac­cord­ing to a study by the US For­est Ser­vice Rocky Moun­tain Re­search Station, a gov­ern­ment or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The study’s au­thors sug­gested that land man­agers pro­mote the use of con­trolled burns in western US forests.</p>
