    <p>In the midst of a pan­demic that has dealt brick-and-mor­tar re­tail a blow and driven book­stores on­line, the last thing most peo­ple would at­tempt is to sell books in a mall.</p>
    <p>Book­seller An­thony Koh Waugh, how­ever, rarely does what peo­ple ex­pect of him.</p>
    <p>Three years af­ter the clo­sure of his Ci­tyLink Mall book­store Book­tique - Where Writ­ers Shop, he has re­turned with a new pop-up con­cept, Chio Books.</p>
    <p>It opened in Beach Road mall City Gate, near Golden Mile Com­plex and art-house cinema The Pro­jec­tor, on Tues­day and will run un­til Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh, 47, hopes Chio Books – its name is a pun on “chio bu”, Hokkien for “pretty girl” – will at­tract not just con­verted read­ers, but also peo­ple who do not typ­i­cally read books to be­gin with.</p>
    <p>Chio Books, a dim space lit by the puls­ing neon glow of LED fur­ni­ture, has the vibe of a chill af­ter­hours bar. Bub­blegum pink and cool mint-toned posters of mod­els hold­ing books adorn the walls.</p>
    <p>While the shop’s 1 80 ti­tles in­clude what Mr Koh terms “lit­er­ary” books – among them this year’s Epi­gram Books Fic­tion Prize-win­ning novel How The Man In Green Saved Pa­hang, And Pos­si­bly The World by Joshua Kam – its stock tends largely to­wards eclec­tic life­style reads.</p>
    <p>Books on dis­play in­clude mor­ti­cian Caitlin Doughty’s in­trigu­ingly ti­tled Will My Cat Eat My Eye­balls? And Other Ques­tions About Dead Bod­ies (2019).</p>
    <p>The space was orig­i­nally in­tended to be a food-and-bev­er­age out­let and comes equipped with sinks, though these have since been re­pur­posed to dis­play books such as Reck­less Daugh­ter (2017), a bi­og­ra­phy of singer-song­writer Joni Mitchell.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has not been kind to phys­i­cal book­stores. Ear­lier this year, in­die stal­wart Book­sAc­tu­ally shut its Tiong Bahru space to move wholly on­line; other brick-and­mor­tar book­sell­ers say they have strug­gled.</p>
    <p>“I am ap­pre­hen­sive,” ad­mits Mr Koh. “This mall has very lit­tle foot traf­fic and there are a lot of un­oc­cu­pied units.”</p>
    <p>City Gate, a mixed-use devel­op­ment on the fringe of Kam­pong Glam, is a world away from Book­tique’s for­mer lo­ca­tion in Ci­tyLink, a bustling stretch fre­quented by MRT com­muters and the of­fice crowd – though this was not enough to save the store, which shut in 2017 af­ter a pro­tracted strug­gle with rent and bills. “Some­times, traf­fic is over­rated,” says Mr Koh.</p>
    <p>He es­ti­mates that he spent $4,000 on the new pop-up, not in­clud­ing rental, which he de­clines to re­veal.</p>
    <p>In the past three years, he has run mostly pop-up book fairs and does not in­tend to set­tle down.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally don’t want to start a phys­i­cal store any more,” he says. “This is some­thing new and, hope­fully, we’ll get dif­fer­ent kinds of col­lab­o­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>“If we can bring our books to a night­club or a pub, that would be great.”</p>
    <p>He has kept some things from Book­tique though, like his old cash reg­is­ter, with which he was try­ing to re­fa­mil­iarise him­self when The Straits Times vis­ited on a rainy af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>“I’ve al­ways liked to chal­lenge my­self,” he says. “Let’s see if this ex­per­i­ment works.”</p>
