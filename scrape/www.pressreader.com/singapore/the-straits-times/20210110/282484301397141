    <p>Mr An­thony Chai and Ms Jade Ng have truly turned their art­fully de­signed home into a busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Their jour­ney started in March 2018 with them record­ing their home ren­o­va­tion process on their In­sta­gram ac­count House­ofchais.</p>
    <p>They quickly gained a fol­low­ing, and the per­sonal record grew first into a side hus­tle and ul­ti­mately, a full-fledged in­te­rior de­sign and styling busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“At first, it was dif­fi­cult to con­vince clients with­out a port­fo­lio, but af­ter get­ting a cou­ple of clients and post­ing our work on In­sta­gram... we started to hit our stride,” said Mr Chai and Ms Ng in an e-mail in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple, who were mar­ried in 2017, reg­is­tered the firm in Septem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>Mr Chai, 32, quit his fi­nance an­a­lyst job the fol­low­ing year to fo­cus on run­ning and grow­ing the com­pany. Ms Ng, 30, still works full time as a re­gional brand man­ager and con­tributes de­sign di­rec­tion and social me­dia con­tent to House­ofchais in her free time.</p>
    <p>Last year, the busi­ness out­grew their home and they rented a cowork­ing space be­fore tak­ing the plunge in Au­gust to open a 1,400 sq ft stu­dio space in Jurong East.</p>
    <p>They have not had to draw on their sav­ings as all prof­its from the busi­ness have been rein­vested.</p>
    <p>“The big­gest in­vest­ment is our time – start­ing and grow­ing this busi­ness has been and still is a 24/7 (task), plus the in­dus­try is a pretty de­mand­ing one,” they said.</p>
    <p>As direc­tor and chief ex­ec­u­tive, Mr Chai draws a salary, though it is less than what he was earn­ing pre­vi­ously. When he was con­sid­er­ing quit­ting his job, the busi­ness was al­ready show­ing po­ten­tial for rev­enue sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>House­ofchais hired its first in­tern in 2019 and its first full-time em­ployee last year. It now has three full-time staff.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple’s ad­vice to oth­ers hop­ing to grow a home-based busi­ness: “Start with a side hus­tle that re­quires lit­tle start-up cap­i­tal, or test an idea at a smaller scale be­fore go­ing all in. Do some­thing you’re pas­sion­ate about and of­fer some­thing dif­fer­ent than what the mar­ket is of­fer­ing...</p>
    <p>“If pos­si­ble, spend time to work on the busi­ness and not in the busi­ness – don’t get lost in day-to-day oper­a­tions.”</p>

They kept costs low through do-it-your&#xAD;self projects, and paint&#xAD;ing the walls and in&#xAD;stalling lights by them&#xAD;selves.</p>
