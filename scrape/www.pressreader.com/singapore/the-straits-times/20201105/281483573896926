    <p>What do artists think about when they think about walk­ing? Many things, as it turns out.</p>
    <p>Putting one foot in front of the other can be a pream­ble to pro­duc­tiv­ity, an es­cape from it, a process of dis­cov­ery – or some­thing else en­tirely.</p>
    <p>The Western world abounds with ex­cur­sions into the idea of walk­ing – from Charles Baude­laire and Wal­ter Ben­jamin’s ideas of the “fla­neur” to more re­cent med­i­ta­tions by writ­ers such as Re­becca Sol­nit and Robert Macfarlane.</p>
    <p>In 1988, per­for­mance artists Ma­rina Abramovic and Ulay fa­mously staged The Lovers, an epic walk where they trekked from op­po­site ends of the Great Wall of China to meet in the mid­dle – and break up with each other.</p>
    <p>But what about the Sin­ga­pore walker?</p>
    <p>The Straits Times speaks to lo­cal arts prac­ti­tion­ers such as pi­o­neer­ing per­for­mance artist Amanda Heng and in­sa­tiable am­bu­list He­man Chong, for whom walk­ing plays a vi­tal role.</p>
    <p>Some of them speak of the med­i­ta­tive as­pect of walk­ing and the way it in­vites serendip­i­tous en­coun­ters.</p>
    <p>Theatremak­er Tan Shou Chen, 38,</p>
    <p>says walk­ing can lead to cre­ative break­throughs.</p>
    <p>A few months ago, he was strolling be­neath the rain­trees in Pasir Ris Park when he came upon the idea for A Bird Calls You To Moscow, an au­dio drama brought to fruition in col­lab­o­ra­tion with play­wright Joel Tan.</p>
    <p>Lis­ten­ers are en­cour­aged to tune in to the sec­ond of three episodes while walk­ing in “a park where the trees are old”.</p>
    <p>The seg­ment is about a woman reach­ing out to her emo­tion­ally dis­tant lover, think­ing about the past and try­ing to fig­ure out how she got to her present sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“Walk­ing is pretty much about stop­ping grav­ity,” Tan Shou Chen says. “We are con­stantly in a state of fall­ing when­ever we are walk­ing. The mo­ment we stop mov­ing, time stops for us – that’s death.</p>
    <p>“I see this episode as some­thing im­por­tant to walk to. She (the woman in the drama) is also search­ing for an­swers, for a path.” Lis­ten to A Bird Calls You To Moscow at str.sg/JuuD</p>
    <p>Pho­tog­ra­pher Marc Nair, 38, has been comb­ing the streets of Bras Basah for scenes of “of­fence”.</p>
    <p>“I’m look­ing at the use of pri­vate and public space, and how the pri­vate pushes its way into public space – ‘softer’ forms of of­fence, not ‘hard’ things like tres­pass­ing,” says Nair, who will cre­ate 15 im­ages as part of an on­go­ing res­i­dency with the Ex­actly Foun­da­tion, a non­profit or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Some scenes have left an im­pres­sion on him – the shock of en­coun­ter­ing funeral wreathes in a com­mu­nal lift land­ing and a man near Raf­fles Ho­tel who de­cided to nap on the side­walk.</p>
    <p>Nair, who is also a poet, says walk­ing is about rhythm.</p>
    <p>“You can walk with the rhythm of the city or walk against it. The pace of Sin­ga­pore is pur­port­edly fast, but there are a lot of slow mo­ments in the city. The cam­era, or the po­etic eye, is able to pull those out. There’s of­ten a very con­tem­pla­tive, al­most med­i­ta­tive, qual­ity to my writ­ing and im­ages be­cause I think I am drawn to find­ing the slow­ness or a sense of per­pe­tu­ity within the city.”</p>
    <p>Nair is do­ing a PhD at RMIT Univer­sity’s School of Me­dia and Com­mu­ni­ca­tion and his the­sis ex­plores how cre­ative prac­tice in­forms the loss of faith. He says, with a nod to philoso­pher Roland Barthes, that he is after a kind of “punc­tum” – that which “wounds” or “pricks” the viewer – when he makes his art.</p>
    <p>When I join him for a walk in Bras Basah one morn­ing, some mo­ments leap out from the quo­tid­ian.</p>
    <p>He points to a bro­ken-down am­bu­lance that has stopped on the road, wait­ing to be res­cued. He also no­tices that some – but not all – of the Ni­coll High­way street signs are ab­bre­vi­ated. “Where’s the con­sis­tency? ‘Ni­coll Hway’ is so weird,” he says, be­fore snap­ping a pic­ture.</p>
    <p>Walk­ing is the best way to un­der­stand a city, he says.</p>
    <p>In March, he and fel­low poet Crispin Ro­drigues cu­rated Un­canny Yishun: A Lit­er­ary Tour, where po­ems, flash fic­tion and flash non-fic­tion of­fered con­trast­ing per­spec­tives of the neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>Nair ad­mits he does more walk­ing when he trav­els, as he is some­times de­terred by Sin­ga­pore’s heat and the “same­ness” of its es­tates.</p>
    <p>Even so, there are things that ex­cite him about Bras Basah – its di­ver­sity and “mi­cro sites and mi­cro scenes”, those fleet­ing mo­ments that might oth­er­wise pass you by.</p>
