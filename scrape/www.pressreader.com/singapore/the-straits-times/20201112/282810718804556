    <p>Hong Kong ac­tor Gallen Lo has sparked spec­u­la­tion that he is un­well af­ter he was re­cently spot­ted at a can­cer cen­tre in the ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>The 57-year-old, who wed Chi­nese ac­tress Su Yan in 2009, is based in Bei­jing. They have a seven-year-old daugh­ter and he has a 20-year-old son from a pre­vi­ous mar­riage.</p>
    <p>Known for TVB se­ri­als such as Old Time Buddy (1997), Se­cret Of The Heart (1998) and Golden Faith (2002), Lo was seen en­ter­ing the can­cer cen­tre at about 9am and left about three hours later.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Ori­en­tal Daily News (ODN), it was prob­a­bly not his first trip there as there were claims pre­vi­ously that he had been spot­ted there a few times, usu­ally in the morn­ing when there are fewer vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>On the day he was spot­ted by ODN, he went to an open-air cafe with his chauf­feur af­ter leav­ing the cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Lo, a known smoker, or­dered a bowl of noo­dles be­fore step­ping out­side for a smoke. He was seen tak­ing two puffs be­fore he stopped smok­ing.</p>
    <p>ODN noted that he took only a few bites of his noo­dles and that he looked thin when he took off his jacket.</p>
    <p>The three-time TVB Best Ac­tor winner told the news­pa­per he was vis­it­ing a friend at the can­cer cen­tre, and that he also took a nu­cleic acid test and con­sulted the doc­tor.</p>
    <p>He said he does not have can­cer and that he goes for health screen­ings reg­u­larly. There was a false ru­mour pre­vi­ously that he was suf­fer­ing from liver can­cer.</p>
    <p>The ac­tor added that he was in Hong Kong to han­dle some mat­ters and visit his son, who has since re­turned to Canada.</p>
    <p>He is cur­rently serv­ing a 14-day quar­an­tine in Shen­zhen, China, and will go to Yangzhou in Jiangsu prov­ince for film­ing af­ter that.</p>
