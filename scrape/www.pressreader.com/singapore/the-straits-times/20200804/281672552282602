    <p>Users who have to don a new mon­i­tor­ing de­vice while they serve out their stay-home no­tice (SHN) need not fear that their ac­tions will be snooped on, the au­thor­i­ties said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The elec­tronic wrist­bands, which alert the au­thor­i­ties should their wear­ers stray from their places of res­i­dence, do not store any per­sonal data and can­not record any video or au­dio, said the Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Author­ity (ICA), Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) and Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE).</p>
    <p>Any data trans­mit­ted is also pro­tected by end-toend cer­tifi­cate-based en­cryp­tion.</p>
    <p>“Only gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials au­tho­rised by the re­spec­tive au­thor­i­ties will have ac­cess to the data for the pur­poses of mon­i­tor­ing and in­ves­ti­ga­tion,” the au­thor­i­ties added.</p>
    <p>Dif­fer­ent de­vices are is­sued by ICA and MOM. ICA’s de­vice is also used by MOE for its stu­dents, while MOM’s is for work pass hold­ers and their de­pen­dants. Stu­dents on SHN re­sid­ing in hos­tels at ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tions are ex­cluded as they would be un­der close ob­ser­va­tion.</p>
    <p>For ICA’s de­vice, the pro­tected data in­cludes the per­sonal de­tails en­tered when users reg­is­ter their de­vices on an ac­com­pa­ny­ing mo­bile app, Stay­Home@SG. The de­vice, de­vel­oped with the Home Team Sci­ence and Tech­nol­ogy Agency (HTX), uses Blue­tooth sig­nals to de­ter­mine if a per­son is within range of his home through the use of a “gate­way de­vice”.</p>
    <p>This gate­way de­vice, linked to the wrist­band, needs to be plugged into a wall power socket at the place of res­i­dence. It uses its own con­nec­tion to ICA, and is not de­pen­dent on ex­ter­nal networks. Nei­ther the gate­way nor wrist­band de­vices store any data. The de­vices work by send­ing an alert to the au­thor­i­ties if the dis­tance be­tween them gets too large.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties get alerts if the wearer at­tempts to re­move or tam­per with the wrist­band, or switch off the gate­way de­vice. While the mo­bile app can use the global po­si­tion­ing sys­tem (GPS) to ob­tain the dis­tance the wearer has strayed from his home, ICA can­not use the app or de­vices to track the ex­act lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the wear­able de­vices is­sued by MOM use GPS tech­nol­ogy in­stead of a linked gate­way de­vice. More de­tails on this de­vice were not avail­able.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties said pub­lic sec­tor data pro­tec­tion rules will be fol­lowed strictly in man­ag­ing and pro­tect­ing per­sonal data col­lected by th­ese de­vices.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude the rec­om­men­da­tions of the Pub­lic Sec­tor Data Se­cu­rity Re­view Com­mit­tee, they added. Among other things, the re­view said the Gov­ern­ment should col­lect only data that is nec­es­sary for its agency, and oth­er­wise min­imise the col­lec­tion and re­ten­tion pe­riod of data.</p>
    <p>While the au­thor­i­ties did not say how long the data col­lected would be kept, ICA and HTX said their de­vice will stop trans­mit­ting data once the SHN pe­riod ceases. The Stay­Home@SG app will also be locked from fur­ther use af­ter that.</p>
