    <p>•</p>
    <p>NEW YORK With no ro­bust sys­tem to iden­tify ge­netic variations of the coron­avirus, ex­perts warn that the United States is woe­fully ill-equipped to track a dan­ger­ous new mu­tant strain, leav­ing health of­fi­cials blind as they try to com­bat the grave threat.</p>
    <p>The vari­ant, which is now surg­ing in Bri­tain and bur­den­ing its hos­pi­tals with new cases, is still rare in the US. But it has the po­ten­tial to ex­plode in the next few weeks, putting new pres­sures on US hos­pi­tals, some of which are al­ready near break­ing point.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has no large-scale, na­tion­wide sys­tem for check­ing coron­avirus genomes for new mu­ta­tions, in­clud­ing the ones car­ried by the new vari­ant.</p>
    <p>About 1.4 mil­lion peo­ple test pos­i­tive for the virus in the US each week, but re­searchers are do­ing genome se­quenc­ing – a method that can defini­tively spot the new vari­ant – only on fewer than 3,000 of those weekly sam­ples.</p>
    <p>And that work is done by a patch­work of aca­demic, state and com­mer­cial lab­o­ra­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists say that a na­tional surveil­lance pro­gramme would be able to de­ter­mine just how widespread the new vari­ant is and help con­tain emerg­ing hot spots, ex­tend­ing the cru­cial win­dow of time in which vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple could get vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>That would cost the US sev­eral hun­dred mil­lion dol­lars or more.</p>
    <p>While that may seem like a steep price tag, it is a tiny frac­tion of the US$16 tril­lion (S$21.16 tril­lion) in eco­nomic losses that the coun­try is es­ti­mated to have sus­tained be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We need some sort of leadership,” said Dr Charles Chiu, a re­searcher at the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, San Fran­cisco, whose team spot­ted some of the first Cal­i­for­nia cases of the new vari­ant.</p>
    <p>“This has to be a sys­tem that is im­ple­mented on a na­tional level. Without that kind of ded­i­cated sup­port, it’s sim­ply not go­ing to get done.”</p>
    <p>With such a sys­tem in place, health of­fi­cials could warn the public in af­fected ar­eas and in­sti­tute new mea­sures to con­tend with the vari­ant – such as us­ing bet­ter masks, con­tact trac­ing, clos­ing schools or im­pos­ing tem­po­rary lockdowns – and do so early, rather than wait­ing un­til a new surge flooded hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>The in­com­ing Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion may be open to the idea.</p>
    <p>“The Pres­i­dent-elect sup­ports a na­tional test­ing pro­gramme that can help stop the spread of Covid-19 and find vari­ants,” said Mr T. J. Ducklo, a spokesman for the tran­si­tion team. “That means more tests, in­creased lab ca­pac­ity and genome se­quenc­ing.”</p>
    <p>Ex­perts point to Bri­tain as a model for what the US could do.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish re­searchers se­quence the genome – that is, the com­plete ge­netic ma­te­rial in a coron­avirus – from up to 10 per cent of new pos­i­tive sam­ples.</p>
    <p>Even if the US se­quenced just 1 per cent of genomes from across the coun­try, or about 2,000 new sam­ples a day, that would shine a bright light on new vari­ants.</p>
    <p>But the US falls far short of that goal now. Over the past month, Amer­i­can re­searchers have se­quenced only a few hun­dred genomes a day, ac­cord­ing to Gisaid, an in­ter­na­tional data­base where re­searchers share new genomes from coro­n­aviruses.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s in­ten­sive pro­gramme to track the ge­netic evo­lu­tion of the coron­avirus, be­gun in March, is prob­a­bly why last month it be­came the first coun­try to iden­tify the new vari­ant, known as B.1.1.7.</p>
    <p>Yale Univer­sity virus ex­pert Nathan Grubaugh and other sci­en­tists are cre­at­ing cus­tom tests for B.1.1.7. But Dr Grubaugh said it would be far bet­ter if re­searchers did not have to scram­ble to cre­ate th­ese tests long af­ter a dan­ger­ous new vari­ant ar­rived in the US.</p>
    <p>“It’s over­all just a Band-Aid on our lack of hav­ing ge­nomic surveil­lance,” he said.</p>
