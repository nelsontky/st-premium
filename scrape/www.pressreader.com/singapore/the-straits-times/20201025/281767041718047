    <p>More than 450 jobs in re­tail, health­care, ed­u­ca­tion and lo­gis­tics were of­fered by five em­ploy­ers at the North West Skill­sFu­ture Mar­ket­place held at Yew Tee Com­mu­nity Club yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The po­si­tions, which are of­fered by Cold Stor­age Sin­ga­pore, E-Bridge Pre-school, Gain City, Methodist Wel­fare Ser­vices and Sankyu Sin­ga­pore, in­clude those for re­tail as­sis­tants, se­cu­rity of­fi­cers, depart­ment man­agers and pre-school teach­ers.</p>
    <p>Some of th­ese roles, such as those in re­tail or the lo­gis­tics in­dus­try, have come about with Covid-19 lead­ing to an in­crease in busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­ised by the North West Com­mu­nity De­vel­op­ment Coun­cil (CDC), the job fair was the first of four to be held monthly over four months across the district, reach­ing out to about 600 res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents can look for­ward to on­site job in­ter­views with prospec­tive em­ploy­ers and seek ca­reer guid­ance from the Na­tional Trades Union Congress’ Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute (e2i).</p>
    <p>There will also be vir­tual work­shops and events to guide job seek­ers on top­ics such as re­sume writ­ing and Skill­sFu­ture cour­ses.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at yes­ter­day’s fair, held in Mar­sil­ing-Yew Tee GRC, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter and Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Fi­nance Lawrence Wong said he hopes the Covid-19 pandemic will spur more Sin­ga­pore­ans to pick up new skills.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, who is also an MP for Mar­sil­ing-Yew Tee GRC, said: “2020 will be a year that we re­mem­ber as a year of Covid-19, a year of tremen­dous dif­fi­cul­ties for the world and for Sin­ga­pore, but if there is a sil­ver lin­ing through this cri­sis, it is that it has also mo­ti­vated many of us to move out of our com­fort zones... to up­grade our­selves.</p>
    <p>“So while the im­me­di­ate fo­cus is on jobs, let’s think harder about how we can con­tinue this mo­men­tum to make Skill­sFu­ture a na­tional move­ment and a na­tional habit for Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
    <p>North West District Mayor Alex Yam, who was at the fair, said: “What we found with some of the job seek­ers is that they pre­fer to look at jobs that are closer to home, which is why we tried to cu­rate, as much as pos­si­ble, jobs that are more fo­cused and re­quire less travel time.”</p>
    <p>Mr Yam, who is also an MP for the GRC, added that North West CDC will con­tinue to bring to­gether em­ploy­ers and com­mu­nity part­ners like e2i to make job and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties ac­ces­si­ble to res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive of e2i Gil­bert Tan said the in­sti­tute has part­nered North West CDC on var­i­ous ini­tia­tives as part of its ef­forts to pro­vide em­ploy­ment as­sis­tance to res­i­dents whose liveli­hoods have been af­fected by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tinue to pro­vide the nec­es­sary ca­reer guid­ance and job match­ing fa­cil­i­ta­tion and train­ing sup­port to our lo­cal work­force dur­ing this dif­fi­cult pe­riod,” he said in a state­ment.</p>
