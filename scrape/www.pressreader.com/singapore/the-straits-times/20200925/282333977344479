    <p>•</p>
    <p>SYD­NEY West­pac Bank­ing will pay a record A$1.3 bil­lion (S$1.26 bil­lion) fine to set­tle Aus­tralia’s big­gest breach of anti-money laun­der­ing laws, cap­ping a saga that shred­ded the bank’s rep­u­ta­tion and cost former chief ex­ec­u­tive Brian Hartzer his job.</p>
    <p>The fine, the largest levied against an Aus­tralian com­pany, is more than the A$900 mil­lion West­pac had set aside for a po­ten­tial penalty, and al­most dou­ble the A$700 mil­lion that ri­val Com­mon­wealth Bank of Aus­tralia paid to set­tle its own money-laun­der­ing breaches in 2018.</p>
    <p>In reach­ing the agree­ment, West­pac ad­mit­ted to about 76,000 ad­di­tional breaches on top of the 23 mil­lion con­tra­ven­tions in the orig­i­nal suit, the fi­nan­cial crimes agency said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>These in­cluded fail­ing to mon­i­tor cus­tomers for trans­ac­tions re­lated to pos­si­ble child abuse or con­duct ad­e­quate risk as­sess­ment of over­seas banks.</p>
    <p>The set­tle­ment closes a sorry 10-month chap­ter in the his­tory of Aus­tralia’s old­est bank. In the im­me­di­ate af­ter­math of the suit, in­tense in­vestor pres­sure led to Mr Hartzer’s res­ig­na­tion and the early re­tire­ment of Mr Lindsay Maxsted as chair­man.</p>
    <p>An in­ves­ti­ga­tion ex­co­ri­ated the lender for an “im­ma­ture and re­ac­tive” risk cul­ture, and found staff lacked the skills, ex­per­tise and ex­pe­ri­ence to ef­fec­tively man­age risk.</p>
    <p>The agree­ment comes with the global fi­nan­cial in­dus­try again fall­ing un­der the spot­light af­ter a cache of leaked doc­u­ments showed that years of trans­ac­tions han­dled by the world’s largest banks were linked to money laun­der­ing, cor­rup­tion and fraud.</p>
    <p>West­pac’s set­tle­ment “sends a strong mes­sage that Aus­trac will take ac­tion to en­sure our fi­nan­cial sys­tem re­mains strong so it can’t be ex­ploited by crim­i­nals”, the fi­nan­cial crimes reg­u­la­tor’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Ni­cole Rose said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“Our role is to harden the fi­nan­cial sys­tem against se­ri­ous crime and ter­ror­ism fi­nanc­ing and this penalty re­flects the se­ri­ous and sys­temic na­ture of West­pac’s non-com­pli­ance.”</p>
    <p>West­pac shares fell as much as 2.4 per cent in early Syd­ney trade. The stock is down 34 per cent this year, mak­ing it the worst per­former among Aus­tralia’s big four banks.</p>
    <p>The fine is equal to the bank’s first-half cash profit. It will take a fur­ther A$404 mil­lion pro­vi­sion to ac­count for the higher penalty and pay Aus­trac’s le­gal costs of A$3.75 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive Peter King again apol­o­gised for the bank’s fail­ings. “We are com­mit­ted to fix­ing the is­sues to en­sure that these mis­takes do not hap­pen again,” he said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“This has been my No. 1 pri­or­ity. We have also closed down rel­e­vant prod­ucts and re­ported all rel­e­vant his­tor­i­cal trans­ac­tions.”</p>
