    <p>NEW YORK • US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den and Vice-Pres­i­den­t­elect Ka­mala Harris have been jointly named Time mag­a­zine’s 2020 Per­son of the Year.</p>
    <p>They were cho­sen from a list of fi­nal­ists that in­cluded the man Mr Bi­den van­quished at the polls – Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>The Demo­cratic for­mer vi­cepres­i­dent and his run­ning mate, a Cal­i­for­nia se­na­tor whose elec­tion broke gen­der and racial bar­ri­ers, to­gether “of­fered restora­tion and re­newal in a sin­gle ticket”, Time said in a pro­file of the pair pub­lished on­line with its an­nounce­ment on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the most tu­mul­tuous US presidenti­al cam­paign in modern times, waged in the throes of a deadly pan­demic, eco­nomic dev­as­ta­tion and a strife-torn na­tional reck­on­ing with racism, Mr Bi­den and Ms Harris pre­vailed in an elec­tion that drew the high­est voter turnout in a cen­tury.</p>
    <p>Time ed­i­tor-in-chief and chief ex­ec­u­tive Ed­ward Felsen­thal cred­ited the vic­tors with suc­ceed­ing in “an ex­is­ten­tial de­bate over what re­al­ity we in­habit”.</p>
    <p>“For chang­ing the Amer­i­can story, for show­ing that the forces of em­pa­thy are greater than the fu­ries of di­vi­sion, for shar­ing a vi­sion of heal­ing in a griev­ing world, Joe Bi­den and Ka­mala Harris are Time’s 2020 Per­son of the Year.”</p>
    <p>He noted that it was the first time that the mag­a­zine had cho­sen to in­clude the vice-pres­i­dent as a per­son of the year.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, the 45th US pres­i­dent and Time’s 2016 Per­son of the Year – so hon­oured a month af­ter his up­set elec­tion vic­tory as the Repub­li­can nom­i­nee that year – was among three other fi­nal­ists in the run­ning this year, Time said.</p>
    <p>The two other fi­nal­ists, both group can­di­dates, were the health­care work­ers bat­tling the Covid-19 pan­demic – which in­cluded the US’ lead­ing in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­pert An­thony Fauci – and par­tic­i­pants in the racial jus­tice move­ment sparked by the May 25 killing of Mr Ge­orge Floyd, a black man who died af­ter a white Min­neapo­lis of­fi­cer knelt on his neck for nearly nine min­utes.</p>
    <p>Time has noted that its se­lec­tion process is not a pop­u­lar­ity con­test, how­ever. Its choice re­flects “the per­son or per­sons who most af­fected the news and our lives, for bet­ter or worse”.</p>
    <p>Along with its Per­son of the Year hon­our, Time mag­a­zine named the Korean pop group BTS as its En­ter­tainer of the Year, and it also crowned bas­ket­ball star LeBron James as Ath­lete of the Year.</p>
    <p>The tra­di­tion goes back to 1927, when Time named avi­a­tor Charles Lind­bergh its first man of the year, as the hon­our was then called.</p>
    <p>Last year, Time named Swedish teenager Greta Thun­berg its per­son of the year, choos­ing her over US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Mr Trump and the Hong Kong pro­test­ers.</p>
