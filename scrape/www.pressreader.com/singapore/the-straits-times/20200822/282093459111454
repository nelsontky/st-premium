    <p>The ap­peal hear­ing in­volv­ing Alju­nied-Hougang Town Coun­cil (AHTC), which is run by the Work­ers’ Party (WP), has been post­poned, fol­low­ing a re­quest by the new Sengkang Town Coun­cil (SKTC).</p>
    <p>The hear­ing was due to be held last Mon­day, but MP He Ting Ru, on be­half of SKTC town coun­cil­lors, had asked for an ad­journ­ment to al­low for “suf­fi­cient time” to con­sider its le­gal po­si­tion on the case, ac­cord­ing to court pa­pers.</p>
    <p>Ms He had writ­ten on Aug 10 to the Supreme Court Reg­istry to re­quest a six-week ad­journ­ment.</p>
    <p>In her let­ter, Ms He re­ferred to the Town Coun­cils (Dec­la­ra­tion) Or­der 2020 and ar­gued that the rel­e­vant sec­tions sug­gest “to us that the out­come of the ap­peal hear­ing and any judg­ment of the Court of Ap­peal will bind SKTC and, there­fore, ul­ti­mately af­fect the res­i­dents of Sengkang whose in­ter­ests we must safe­guard”.</p>
    <p>She added: “We con­sider it pru­dent to ob­tain le­gal ad­vice re­lat­ing to the steps SKTC ought to take (if any) in­clud­ing whether to file an ap­pli­ca­tion for in­ter­ven­tion and if so, the le­gal po­si­tion to take.”</p>
    <p>SKTC’s in­volve­ment in the case stems from the chang­ing sta­tus of Pung­gol East since 2013.</p>
    <p>Pung­gol East was man­aged by AHTC when it was a sin­gle-seat con­stituency won by the WP in the 2013 by-elec­tion.</p>
    <p>But in the 2015 Gen­eral Elec­tion, it was wrested back by the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party and came un­der the Pasir Ris-Pung­gol Town Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>The sin­gle-seat con­stituency, how­ever, be­came part of the new Sengkang GRC when the elec­toral bound­aries were drawn for the gen­eral elec­tion on July 10.</p>
    <p>With the WP win­ning Sengkang GRC, the area now comes un­der the SKTC.</p>
    <p>The ap­peals court hear­ing fol­lows a High Court judg­ment last year which held that for­mer WP chief Low Thia Khi­ang and party chair­man Sylvia Lim had breached their fidu­ciary du­ties to the AHTC, among other things.</p>
    <p>Both of them were then town coun­cil­lors of AHTC, which had taken a civil suit against them for al­leged im­proper pay­ments made un­der their watch.</p>
    <p>The case also in­volved WP chief Pri­tam Singh and other AHTC town coun­cil­lors as well as the for­mer man­ag­ing agents of AHTC. They, too, are ap­peal­ing against the High Court judg­ment.</p>
    <p>The re­quest for ad­journ­ment by SKTC fol­lowed from a let­ter that the law firms in­volved in the case, in­clud­ing Davin­der Singh Cham­bers, had re­ceived from the Supreme Court ear­lier this month, in­form­ing them that the hear­ing of the ap­peals was to be held on Aug 17.</p>
    <p>They wrote to the Supreme Court Reg­istry on Aug 5, say­ing that they would leave it to the court to de­cide whether the ap­peal hear­ing should pro­ceed on Aug 17.</p>
    <p>The court replied that it would pro­ceed un­less SKTC ap­plies to in­ter­vene or seek any re­lief, such as an ad­journ­ment.</p>
    <p>As Sengkang Town Coun­cil was not a party to the ap­peals, it sent its re­quest for an ad­journ­ment to the Supreme Court Reg­istry and also wrote sep­a­rately to Davin­der Singh Cham­bers for its as­sis­tance in draw­ing the Reg­istry’s at­ten­tion to the re­quest which, in turn, was brought to the top court’s no­tice.</p>
