    <p>SEAT­TLE • Weeks of vi­o­lent clashes be­tween fed­eral agents and pro­test­ers in Port­land, Ore­gon, gal­vanised thou­sands of peo­ple to march through the streets of Amer­i­can cities on Satur­day, in­ject­ing new life into protests that had largely waned in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>One of the most intense protests was in Seat­tle, where a day of clashes left a trail of bro­ken win­dows, slashed tyres and burn­ing trail­ers.</p>
    <p>At least 45 pro­test­ers had been ar­rested by the early evening, and both pro­test­ers and po­lice of­fi­cers were in­jured.</p>
    <p>Car­ry­ing signs say­ing “Feds Go Home” and shout­ing chants of “No jus­tice, no peace”, some among the crowd of about 5,000 pro­test­ers stopped at the site of a fu­ture youth de­ten­tion cen­tre and lit build­ings there on fire.</p>
    <p>Some smashed win­dows of nearby busi­nesses, ig­nited a fire in a cof­fee shop and blew a 20cm hole through the wall of the Seat­tle Po­lice Depart­ment’s East Precinct build­ing, the po­lice said.</p>
    <p>“At this point, we de­clared the event to be a riot, and sev­eral or­ders to dis­perse were given,” Seat­tle po­lice chief Car­men Best said at a news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>The po­lice con­fronted the crowd, de­ploy­ing flash grenades and pep­per spray be­fore tak­ing peo­ple into cus­tody.</p>
    <p>In Austin, Texas, the po­lice said one man was shot and killed just be­fore 10pm dur­ing a protest in the city’s down­town.</p>
    <p>In Los An­ge­les, pro­test­ers clashed with of­fi­cers in front of the fed­eral court­house down­town. Videos showed peo­ple smash­ing win­dows and lob­bing wa­ter bot­tles at of­fi­cers af­ter pro­test­ers said the po­lice fired pro­jec­tiles at them.</p>
    <p>The fed­eral court­house in Port­land has been the scene of nightly, chaotic demon­stra­tions for weeks, which looked likely to con­tinue on Satur­day as thou­sands par­tic­i­pated in marches around the city, in the 58th con­sec­u­tive day of protests there.</p>
    <p>Nurses in scrubs joined an or­gan­ised group of mothers in hel­mets and fathers in hard hats be­side the fence of a fed­eral court­house where fed­eral agents – a de­ploy­ment that has been a key fo­cus of the re­cent demon­stra­tions – have been as­sem­bled.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers in sev­eral cities said the smoke-filled videos of fed­eral agents fir­ing tear gas and shov­ing pro­test­ers in Port­land had brought them to the streets on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Ms Bipasha Mukher­jee, 52, from Kirk­land, Wash­ing­ton state, said she had been protest­ing on the streets since May and that it was wor­ri­some to her to see such ag­gres­sive tac­tics used by the po­lice.</p>
    <p>“This is not the coun­try I im­mi­grated to,” said Ms Mukher­jee, who ar­rived from In­dia more than 30 years ago. “It feels like we are rapidly be­com­ing a fas­cist state and a po­lice state.”</p>
    <p>A CHANGED COUN­TRY</p>
