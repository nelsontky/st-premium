    <p>“It is im­por­tant your home re­flects your char­ac­ter,” say own­ers Lindy Lin and Denice Chua of this five­room Hous­ing Board flat in Jurong West. And theirs, filled with vin­tage sou­venirs from their trav­els, toys and other me­men­toes, does ex­actly that.</p>
    <p>The own­ers, who are in their 30s, called on Ms Car­men Tang, de­sign di­rec­tor of home-grown bou­tique de­sign stu­dio Wolf Woof, to cre­ate a cosy abode that caters to their dif­fer­ing pref­er­ences: a love of a lighter pal­ette ver­sus a pen­chant for punchy hues and black ac­cents.</p>
    <p>A key fea­ture is the dec­o­ra­tive ce­ment breeze-block at the en­trance that pays homage to Ms Lin’s Per­anakan her­itage on her grand­mother’s side. Be­yond it is the kitchen with glass ac­cor­dion doors that let light in, lend a sense of open­ness and keep cook­ing fumes away from the rest of the home.</p>
    <p>The com­bined liv­ing and din­ing area is spa­cious but ir­reg­u­larly shaped. In­ter­est­ingly, its an­gles gel smoothly with the eclec­tic, play­ful vibe of the decor.</p>
    <p>“Work­ing around the odd lay­out was one of the main chal­lenges,” Ms Tang points out. “Built-in fur­nish­ings were kept min­i­mal to keep the place from feel­ing cramped.”</p>
    <p>Thought­fully placed fur­ni­ture and a di­vider help de­mar­cate the dif­fer­ent ar­eas in the open lay­out of the 1,185 sq ft home. The pair moved in af­ter a three-month ren­o­va­tion, which set them back by $62,000, in­clud­ing the fur­ni­ture.</p>
    <p>The neu­tral base pal­ette is punched up with a cheer­ful mix of pat­terned rugs, bright cush­ions, movie posters and shelves of toys.</p>
    <p>One’s gaze is in­stantly drawn to a sculp­tural wooden swing chair from shop­ping web­site Taobao that sits i n one of the home own­ers’ favourite spot.</p>
    <p>The home is also brim­ming with vin­tage finds, i nclud­ing an old pro­jec­tor that used to be­long to a rel­a­tive, a red let­ter­box from an an­tique shop in Haji Lane and an an­tique Siemens Broth­ers & Co tele­phone on the wall.</p>
    <p>“I bought that from Lon­don’s Por­to­bello Road Mar­ket in 2013 and it still works. The cus­toms of­fi­cer thought it was a bomb as I’d stuffed it i nto my back­pack,” re­calls Ms Lin, a cor­po­rate sales man­ager, with a laugh.</p>
    <p>What was pre­vi­ously a walk­way with a built-in wardrobe that led to the mas­ter bed­room is now a cosy study that pro­vides the pair with more op­por­tu­ni­ties to show­case their mas­sive toy col­lec­tion in two dis­play cab­i­nets.</p>
    <p>The new mas­ter bed­room is dressed in sooth­ing mint and light wood, and is sim­ply but taste­fully fur­nished with a cu­rated selec­tion of quirky finds, in­clud­ing a su­per­hero ro­bot-in­spired lamp from Kick­starter.</p>
    <p>When it comes to build­ing a home you love, the own­ers say: “It is im­por­tant to be on the same page as the de­signer. You also have to be pre­pared to scrap things that aren’t cost-ef­fec­tive and be flex­i­ble. We were ini­tially into the mid­cen­tury mod­ern look, but changed things up to fit our tastes.</p>
    <p>“Talk to your part­ner and be open to ideas. If you’re stub­born, you’ll wind up with a home that looks like ev­ery­one else’s.”</p>
