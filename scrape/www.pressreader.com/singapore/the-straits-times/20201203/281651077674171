    <p>Cell-cul­tured meat may be an in­no­va­tion that started out in a lab­o­ra­tory – but when scaled up, it will be done in a fa­cil­ity sim­i­lar to a beer brew­ery, said Mr Josh Tet­rick, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Eat Just.</p>
    <p>“The meat we’re mak­ing is cre­ated in large cul­ti­va­tors or biore­ac­tors that, in time, will re­sem­ble a beer brew­ery or sim­i­lar fa­cil­ity used for pro­duc­tion of cul­tured food prod­ucts,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Cal­i­for­nian start-up has just re­ceived ap­proval from the Sin­ga­pore au­thor­i­ties to sell its cul­tured chicken bites here – the first time that cul­tured meat prod­ucts will be avail­able on the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Mr Tet­rick said: “(Re­fer­ring to it as) lab-made is a red her­ring and has an in­her­ently neg­a­tive con­no­ta­tion. Many of the foods we eat... in­clud­ing most pro­cessed foods, start in a lab set­ting and are scaled up and com­mer­cialised.”</p>
    <p>The cre­ation of the cul­tured meat prod­uct be­gins with iso­lat­ing cells from an an­i­mal, which can be done through meth­ods such as per­form­ing a biopsy from a live an­i­mal, or get­ting the cells from an es­tab­lished an­i­mal cell bank.</p>
    <p>Then, the cells are trans­ferred into a nu­tri­ent-rich cul­ture me­dia, where they nat­u­rally mul­ti­ply.</p>
    <p>“Once a cul­ture of cells has been es­tab­lished, the cells are fed with a pro­pri­etary mix of pro­teins, amino acids, min­er­als, sug­ars and salts and other nu­tri­ents while in­side of a biore­ac­tor, which mim­ics con­di­tions in­side the body of an an­i­mal,” said Mr Tet­rick.</p>
    <p>Once the an­i­mal cells achieve a suf­fi­cient den­sity within the biore</p>
    <p>ac­tor, they are har­vested.</p>
    <p>“The har­vested prod­uct can be used by chefs in mul­ti­ple fi­nal for­mats, from less-struc­tured crispy chicken bites, savoury chorizo and sausages, to more tex­tured prod­ucts such as grilled chicken breasts,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Elaine Siu, manag­ing di­rec­tor of The Good Food In­sti­tute Asia-Pa­cific, an in­ter­na­tional non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion that pro­motes pro­tein al­ter­na­tives, said cul­ti­vat­ing meat in the equiv­a­lent of a brew­ery is safer, cleaner and more ef­fi­cient than rais­ing an­i­mals in farms.</p>
    <p>“Rather than grow­ing mus­cle tis­sue in­side live an­i­mals, cul­ti­vated meat pro­duc­ers take a few an­i­mal cells and use a mix­ture of nu­tri­ents to grow those cells into a piece of meat,” she said.</p>
    <p>“As a re­sult, we get pure meat, the pro­duc­tion of which doesn’t re­quire an­tibi­otics, doesn’t re­quire slaugh­ter, and doesn’t suf­fer from fe­cal E. coli, sal­mo­nella or other con­tam­i­na­tion.”</p>
    <p>Also, fac­tory farms are not so nat­u­ral, Ms Siu noted, adding: “Al­most all con­ven­tional meat is the prod­uct of both ar­ti­fi­cial in­sem­i­na­tion and mas­sive doses of growth-pro­mot­ing drugs.”</p>
    <p>The need for al­ter­na­tive pro­teins is mount­ing in the face of chal­lenges such as feeding a grow­ing global pop­u­la­tion and cli­mate change. Al­ter­na­tive pro­tein is con­sid­ered more sus­tain­able as large vol­umes can be pro­duced with rel­a­tively small amounts of land and labour. But more stud­ies need to be done be­fore the pros and cons of cul­tured meat can be as­sessed.</p>
    <p>A paper pub­lished in sci­en­tific jour­nal Fron­tiers In Nu­tri­tion in Fe­bru­ary noted that in terms of en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact, there has been no con­sen­sus about cul­ti­vated meat com­pared with con­ven­tional meat.</p>
    <p>The paper also said the loss of the live­stock sec­tor would have im­pli­ca­tions on re­lated in­dus­tries, such as wool, fi­bre and leather, and im­pact ru­ral pop­u­la­tions that de­pend on live­stock for in­come.</p>
