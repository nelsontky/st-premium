    <p>BANGKOK • In the murky wa­ters of the Strait of Malacca, about 144km south of Phuket, Thai­land, four divers dis­cov­ered a World War II sub­ma­rine that was scut­tled 77 years ago and is now teem­ing with ma­rine life.</p>
    <p>The wreck­age, be­lieved to be the USS Gre­nadier, was found last Oc­to­ber by divers Jean Luc Rivoire, Lance Horowitz, Benoit La­borie and Ben Rey­menants, the team an­nounced this month.</p>
    <p>Over the sub­se­quent six months, the men com­pleted six dives to study and iden­tify the sub­ma­rine, Mr Horowitz, 36, said last Fri­day from Phuket.</p>
    <p>Af­ter mea­sur­ing parts of the sub­ma­rine and com­par­ing them with tech­ni­cal draw­ings from the US National Archives and Records Ad­min­is­tra­tion, they felt con­fi­dent they had lo­cated the Gre­nadier, he said.</p>
    <p>“It was as good as we were hop­ing for, re­ally,” Mr Horowitz said of the team’s US$110,000 (S$150,000) ex­pe­di­tion. “It was a very pow­er­ful feel­ing; it was won­der­ful.”</p>
    <p>The Gre­nadier is more than 91m long and weighs 1,475 tonnes, ac­cord­ing to the Naval His­tory and Her­itage Com­mand.</p>
    <p>The sub­ma­rine was found sit­ting up­right more than 79m un­der­wa­ter, the divers said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Robert Palmer, a sailor who was aboard the Gre­nadier, wrote in a book ti­tled The Silent Ser­vice In World War II that in the early morn­ing of April 22, 1943, crew mem­bers fired at a Ja­panese plane, which dropped a bomb nearby.</p>
    <p>All 76 men sur­vived but were picked up by a Ja­panese armed mer­chant ship and tor­tured, Mr Palmer said. Four died in cap­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>The next step is to have the find­ings ver­i­fied by the naval his­tory com­mand.</p>
    <p>That will likely take a few months, ac­cord­ing to Dr Robert Ney­land, head of the com­mand’s un­der­wa­ter ar­chae­ol­ogy branch.</p>
    <p>“Con­firm­ing the iden­tity of any po­ten­tial dis­cov­ery, as in the case of USS Gre­nadier, is a process that is given much weight by the US Navy, as not only does it af­ford le­gal pro­tec­tions to the site through the Sunken Mil­i­tary Craft Act, but the act can also pro­vide clo­sure to the fam­i­lies of those sailors lost in the line of duty,” he said in an email.</p>
