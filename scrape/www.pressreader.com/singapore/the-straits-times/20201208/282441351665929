    <p>BARCELONA • Lionel Messi’s ri­valry with Cris­tiano Ron­aldo has en­thralled foot­ball for the bet­ter part of a decade, and the pair will duel for the first time in the group stage when Barcelona host Ju­ven­tus in the Cham­pi­ons League to­day.</p>
    <p>Both teams have al­ready qual­i­fied for the last 16 so the clash will sim­ply de­cide which team claims top spot in Group G.</p>
    <p>With the hosts lead­ing by three points and a su­pe­rior goal dif­fer­ence, Barca are al­most guar­an­teed to emerge as group win­ners un­less Juve score at least three goals and win by a mar­gin that over­turns their 2-0 de­feat in the re­verse fix­ture in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>The game, how­ever, will not just be a dead rub­ber for Ron­ald Koe­man’s men. With four de­feats this sea­son, Barca are floun­der­ing in La Liga, and the team are in search of a con­fi­dence booster at the Nou Camp.</p>
    <p>At his vir­tual pre-match press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, the Barca coach said: “Our ob­jec­tive is to play well and win each game. We won 2-0 away at their ground and took all three points, so for that rea­son, we have a great chance of fin­ish­ing first in the group.”</p>
    <p>“We are miss­ing im­por­tant play­ers. We will have to look to do the best we can, both tech­ni­cally and tac­ti­cally, as well as be­ing fresh. Against Ju­ven­tus, we will put out a strong side be­cause we want to fin­ish first in the group.”</p>
    <p>Winger Ous­mane Dem­bele, who picked up a ham­string in­jury in their de­feat by Cadiz over the week­end, has been ruled out while Ger­ard Pique and Ansu Fati re­main out for the long term.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the wors­en­ing in­jury sit­u­a­tion is not an ex­cuse for a se­quence of costly de­fen­sive howlers in their past three away league games, Koe­man in­sisted.</p>
    <p>The Dutch­man, who re­mains un­der pres­sure af­ter an un­der­whelm­ing start since be­ing ap­pointed in Au­gust, added: “You al­ways have to an­a­lyse de­feats. You have to look at how they are scor­ing and our ef­fec­tive­ness out there on the field. If I lose, I am an­gry.</p>
    <p>“I think be­ing at Barca, we can’t ac­cept some of the goals that we have con­ceded in cer­tain games.</p>
    <p>“The play­ers know we have to im­prove cer­tain things. We want to find a bal­ance be­tween per­for­mance, ef­fec­tive­ness and not mak­ing so many mis­takes at the back.”</p>
    <p>On fac­ing Ron­aldo, who missed the game in Turin due to a pos­i­tive Covid-19 test, he said: “For us, it’s not a mo­ti­vat­ing fac­tor (to face him).</p>
    <p>“They (Juve) are a big team and there are two big teams fight­ing to be top of the group.</p>
    <p>“Cris­tiano is one of the best, he al­ways bat­tles and al­ways scores. He is still at the top due to him work­ing hard ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>“It’s great (Barca captain) Messi and Cris­tiano are at the top level... They are both play­ers to ad­mire.”</p>
    <p>I think be­ing at Barca, we can’t ac­cept some of the goals that we have con­ceded in cer­tain games. The play­ers know we have to im­prove cer­tain things.</p>
    <p>RON­ALD KOE­MAN, Barcelona coach, who is an­gry with their re­cent per­for­mances in La Liga.</p>
