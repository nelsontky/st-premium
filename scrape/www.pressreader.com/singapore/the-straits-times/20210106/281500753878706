    <p>We are in a new year and af­ter all that feast­ing dur­ing the fes­tive sea­son, it is time to bring the fo­cus back to healthy eat­ing.</p>
    <p>Break­fast is of­ten called the most im­por­tant meal of the day, so what bet­ter way to be­gin the year right than by start­ing each day with a healthy meal?</p>
    <p>Com­pared with other meals, break­fast is unique in that it can set the tone for the whole day, for bet­ter or for worse, said Ms Me­lanie An­tho­nysamy, who leads the nutri­tion team at dig­i­tal health plat­form Health­i­fyMe.</p>
    <p>It fu­els us up for the day by giv­ing our bod­ies the re­quired nu­tri­ents, kick-starts our me­tab­o­lism and helps us to con­cen­trate bet­ter.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing a nu­tri­tious break­fast will lead to a good start (to the day), as it cre­ates pos­i­tive en­ergy and mo­men­tum, mak­ing it more likely that you’ll do what you need to do and do it well,” said Ms An­tho­nysamy.</p>
    <p>Break­fast is im­por­tant as it helps to man­age a per­son’s en­ergy level.</p>
    <p>“When you wake up in the morn­ing af­ter go­ing with­out food for at least eight to nine hours, your glyco­gen stores are low. Eat­ing break­fast boosts your en­ergy level and re­stores these glyco­gen lev­els to keep your me­tab­o­lism up for the day,” she ex­plained.</p>
    <p>While it is good to start the day with break­fast, Mr Louis Yap, a se­nior di­eti­tian at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hos­pi­tal, said it is im­por­tant to watch what we eat, as poor break­fast choices may in­crease the risk of de­vel­op­ing heart dis­eases.</p>
    <p>A bal­anced break­fast should con­tain car­bo­hy­drates, pro­tein, fi­bre, vi­ta­mins and min­er­als. Food high in nu­tri­ents in­clude oat­meal with low-fat yo­gurt and fresh fruits, tuna sand­wich, multi-grain ce­real with low-fat milk and omelette with spinach, tomato and cheese.</p>
    <p>Fried bee hoon, fried frit­ters, cakes, roti prata with su­gar or curry should be avoided as they are high in sat­u­rated fat, calo­ries and su­gar, and can cause obe­sity and chronic dis­eases such as can­cer.</p>
    <p>The best time to con­sume break­fast is within two hours of wak­ing up, said Ms An­tho­nysamy.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing a meal within this pe­riod helps to sta­bilise blood su­gar and reg­u­late one’s ap­petite through­out the day. Go­ing about the day with an empty stom­ach or hav­ing a late break­fast will lead to overeat­ing in the next meal, she added.</p>
    <p>Teacher Pal Singh, 35, starts ev­ery day with a hearty break­fast con­sist­ing of a slice of pur­ple wheat bread, a bowl of whole­grain oats with low-fat milk, an ap­ple and a glass of kale and veg­gie juice.</p>
    <p>He said he feels more en­er­getic through­out the day and does not need to snack in be­tween meals. “I am also on track to eat healthy meals for the day, hav­ing started the day with one,” he said.</p>
    <p>In­deed, hav­ing a healthy break­fast reg­u­larly en­cour­ages peo­ple to main­tain bet­ter eat­ing habits and makes it less likely for them to eat snacks dur­ing the day, said Ms An­tho­nysamy.</p>
    <p>Stud­ies have also shown that those who con­sume a healthy</p>
    <p>While skip­ping a meal in the morn­ing is com­mon in some in­ter­mit­tent fast­ing meth­ods... it may put a per­son at an in­creased risk of di­a­betes. Not con­sum­ing break­fast af­fects one’s glu­cose me­tab­o­lism and how sen­si­tive the body is to in­sulin – the hor­mone which helps keep our blood su­gar level bal­anced.</p>
    <p>break­fast have a lower risk of de­vel­op­ing obe­sity-re­lated dis­eases and chronic dis­eases such as type 2 di­a­betes and car­dio­vas­cu­lar disease.</p>
    <p>Re­search has also shown that a healthy break­fast can boost brain power and im­prove at­ten­tion and the con­cen­tra­tion span needed for the day’s ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>While skip­ping a meal in the morn­ing is com­mon in some in­ter­mit­tent fast­ing meth­ods, Ms An­tho­nysamy ad­vises against it as it may put a per­son at an in­creased risk of di­a­betes.</p>
    <p>Not con­sum­ing break­fast af­fects one’s glu­cose me­tab­o­lism and how sen­si­tive the body is to in­sulin – the hor­mone that helps keep our blood su­gar level bal­anced, she said.</p>
    <p>Ms An­tho­nysamy said the body goes through a fast­ing phase while sleep­ing. The lack of food dur­ing this pe­riod re­duces the blood glu­cose level and, in or­der to main­tain a bal­anced level, the body ac­ti­vates a process called glu­co­neo­ge­n­e­sis to con­vert amino acids (pro­tein) into glu­cose.</p>
    <p>“Over time, if one con­tin­u­ally skips break­fast, the body will adapt to this process and the ef­fi­ciency of ‘burn­ing’ glu­cose for en­ergy will be im­paired, which may in­crease the risk of di­a­betes,” she added.</p>
    <p>Mr Derrick Ong, a di­eti­tian and founder of Eat Right Clinic & Nutri­tion Con­sul­tancy, said in­ter­mit­tent fast­ing that in­cludes skip­ping break­fast can be dan­ger­ous for cer­tain groups of peo­ple such as di­a­bet­ics on blood su­gar-low­er­ing or in­sulin med­i­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>They may be at a greater risk of get­ting hy­po­gly­caemia, also known as low blood su­gar.</p>
    <p>Preg­nant women should also not skip break­fast, as the foe­tus needs nu­tri­ents for healthy growth, he said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Yap said peo­ple who have not been tak­ing break­fast should prob­a­bly re­main that way.</p>
    <p>A study in peer-re­viewed jour­nal Tay­lor & Fran­cis On­line in Septem­ber last year found that peo­ple who have not been eat­ing break­fast pre­vi­ously and start do­ing so may put on weight, par­tic­u­larly fat mass, putting them at an in­creased risk of car­dio­vas­cu­lar dis­eases.</p>
    <p>But Mr Yap also stressed that the ev­i­dence re­mains lim­ited due to fac­tors such as the small sam­ple size of the study. “What mat­ters is that we should try to opt for health­ier food,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms An­tho­nysamy agreed. “By eat­ing a healthy break­fast, you are send­ing a mes­sage to your­self that you re­spect your body, want to take care of your health and well­be­ing, and that you de­serve to en­joy a good life.”</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>HAV­ING BREAK­FAST HELPS WITH WEIGHT LOSS</p>
    <p>Stud­ies have shown sim­i­lar weight loss for in­di­vid­u­als who have break­fast and those who do not. There is still a lack of long-term data in this area.</p>
    <p>Any­one on a weight loss pro­gramme should seek med­i­cal at­ten­tion from doc­tors and di­eti­tians to en­sure that the weight loss is done in a healthy and safe man­ner.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>PRE­PAR­ING BREAK­FAST IS TIME CON­SUM­ING</p>
    <p>Pre­par­ing a healthy break­fast does not take a lot of ef­fort.</p>
    <p>It could be as sim­ple as ce­real and low-fat milk, toast with scram­bled egg, or even overnight oats to grab and go in the morn­ing.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>EAT­ING BREAK­FAST DOES NOT MAKE A DIF­FER­ENCE</p>
    <p>This is not true.</p>
    <p>Eat­ing a well bal­anced break­fast with the right amount of car­bo­hy­drates, pro­tein and fi­bre is ef­fec­tive in main­tain­ing en­ergy.</p>
    <p>It re­duces crav­ings through­out the day and helps boost per­for­mance and me­tab­o­lism.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>IT IS BET­TER TO EAT FRUIT ON AN EMPTY STOM­ACH</p>
    <p>This is not true.</p>
    <p>Our stom­ach mixes the food con­tent, what­ever the se­quence you con­sume it in. It does not nec­es­sar­ily mean fruit will be the first to be ab­sorbed.</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>I DON’T MOVE MUCH IN THE MORN­ING, SO I DON’T NEED TO EAT BREAK­FAST</p>
    <p>This is a com­mon mis­con­cep­tion.</p>
    <p>Our or­gans re­quire en­ergy to func­tion well at all times.</p>

Add chicken or fish for sati&#xAD;ety and some mush&#xAD;room to make the meal whole&#xAD;some.&#xD;&#xA;OVERNIGHT OATS: A mix of rolled oats, milk, yo&#xAD;gurt, nuts and fruit is a nu&#xAD;tri&#xAD;tious meal that can be pre&#xAD;pared in five min&#xAD;utes or less. Rolled oats help to reg&#xAD;u&#xAD;late blood su&#xAD;gar, thanks to their mod&#xAD;er&#xAD;ate to high fi&#xAD;bre con&#xAD;tent and lower gly&#xAD;caemic in&#xAD;dex.</p>

        <p data-role="text">CLEAR SOUP NOO&#xAD;DLES: Com&#xAD;pared with curry noo&#xAD;dles, laksa and other creamy soup dishes, clear soup has fewer calo&#xAD;ries and less sat&#xAD;u&#xAD;rated fat as no co&#xAD;conut milk is added. Add some minced meat, bean sprouts and leafy veg&#xAD;eta&#xAD;bles to make it a whole&#xAD;some meal.&#xD;&#xA;BROWN BREAD SAND&#xAD;WICH: It can be an egg, cheese or tuna sand&#xAD;wich or even an unsweet&#xAD;ened peanut but&#xAD;ter sand&#xAD;wich. Add some let&#xAD;tuce, tomato and cu&#xAD;cum&#xAD;ber slices for a healthy break&#xAD;fast.</p>

        <p data-role="text">ROTI PRATA AND TEH TARIK: Roti prata is high in re&#xAD;fined car&#xAD;bo&#xAD;hy&#xAD;drates and fat. Each piece has 272kcal, ex&#xAD;clud&#xAD;ing curry. Teh tarik has two to three ta&#xAD;ble&#xAD;spoons of su&#xAD;gar &#x2013; 60 per cent of the rec&#xAD;om&#xAD;mended su&#xAD;gar in&#xAD;take in a day.&#xD;&#xA;CHAR KWAY TEOW: This meal is not rec&#xAD;om&#xAD;mended as it is loaded with calo&#xAD;ries and is high in fat due to the oil used in fry&#xAD;ing. A plate has 510kcal with 21g of oil, or about four tea&#xAD;spoons.&#xD;&#xA;PURI AND POTATO GRAVY: This is a com&#xAD;mon break&#xAD;fast among In&#xAD;di&#xAD;ans. How&#xAD;ever, this dish is not very healthy as puri is deep fried and, when com&#xAD;bined with potato gravy, is loaded with car&#xAD;bo&#xAD;hy&#xAD;drates.</p>
