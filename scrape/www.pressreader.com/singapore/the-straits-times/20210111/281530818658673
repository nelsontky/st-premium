    <p>More O-level school leavers are tak­ing the poly­tech­nic route. The Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion said that of the 20,300 can­di­dates posted to a post-sec­ondary ed­u­ca­tion in­sti­tu­tion last year via the Joint Ad­mis­sions Ex­er­cise, 52 per cent were posted to the five poly­tech­nics here. This is a record in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>With a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of their study and ca­reer as­pi­ra­tions and en­cour­aged by the in­creas­ing num­ber of poly­tech­nic grad­u­ates mak­ing it to the lo­cal uni­ver­si­ties, more O-level school leavers are tak­ing the poly­tech­nic route.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) said that of the 20,300 can­di­dates posted to a post-sec­ondary ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tion last year via the Joint Ad­mis­sions Ex­er­cise, 52 per cent were posted to the five poly­tech­nics here. This is a record in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>An­other 38 per cent were given places in the ju­nior col­leges (JCs) and Mil­len­nia In­sti­tute, a fig­ure that did not ac­count for those en­rolled in the six-year In­te­grated Pro­gramme, where stu­dents skip the O lev­els and go straight to JC1.</p>
    <p>An­other 10 per cent were posted to the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion. MOE said around 45 per cent of the O-level stu­dents ad­mit­ted to the poly­tech­nics last year had qual­i­fied for JC, which re­quires bet­ter re­sults for en­try, com­pared with 40 per cent in 2014.</p>
    <p>To qual­ify for a JC place, a stu­dent’s L1R5 score – based on English and five rel­e­vant sub­jects – must not ex­ceed 20 points.</p>
    <p>Poly­tech­nics re­quire grades for English and four other sub­jects to not ex­ceed 26 points, although for the more pop­u­lar cour­ses, suc­cess­ful ap­pli­cants need to score un­der 12 points.</p>
    <p>Te­masek Poly­tech­nic (TP) bio­med­i­cal engi­neer­ing stu­dent Jove Lee, 18, re­alised while in sec­ondary school that he prefers hands-on learn­ing.</p>
    <p>The stu­dent, who had done well enough in his O lev­els to en­ter a top JC, said: “I hope to go on to do re­search in bio­med­i­cine, but I chose to go to a poly be­cause I learn so much bet­ter when I get to prac­tise what I learn.”</p>
    <p>TP prin­ci­pal Peter Lam noted that in re­cent years, the poly­tech­nic has seen an in­creased pro­por­tion of JC-el­i­gi­ble stu­dents en­rolling in its di­ploma pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>He said: “I see this as the di­rect re­sult of MOE’s ed­u­ca­tion and ca­reer guid­ance pro­gramme, which has suc­cess­fully pro­vided stu­dents with com­pre­hen­sive in­for­ma­tion re­gard­ing their ed­u­ca­tion and ca­reer op­tions.”</p>
    <p>Schools have stepped up ed­u­ca­tion and ca­reer coun­selling so that those go­ing for fur­ther ed­u­ca­tion will be able to make more in­formed de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>Added Mr Lam: “There is now a greater aware­ness of poly ed­u­ca­tion and the many path­ways be­yond the di­ploma apart from work, such as fur­ther stud­ies in the uni­ver­si­ties and work-study pro­grammes.”</p>
    <p>Stu­dents and par­ents in­ter­viewed said the poly route has also be­come more ap­peal­ing, with the Gov­ern­ment mak­ing more places avail­able to those who want to up­grade their di­ploma to a de­gree.</p>
    <p>When the Gov­ern­ment an­nounced the ex­pan­sion of univer­sity places in 2012, only 20 per cent of poly grad­u­ates made it to the lo­cal uni­ver­si­ties. By 2019, 30 per cent of poly grad­u­ates made it to one of the six lo­cal uni­ver­si­ties.</p>
    <p>Most of the new univer­sity places cre­ated, in­clud­ing at the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences and Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy, went to poly di­ploma hold­ers.</p>
    <p>House­wife R. Mallika, 46, and her hus­band, who both hold de­grees, said their en­tre­pre­neur­ial 17-yearold son, who is col­lect­ing his Olevel re­sults to­day, wants to study bank­ing and fi­nance in Ngee Ann Poly­tech­nic.</p>
    <p>“We both started off pre­fer­ring the JCs, but now look­ing at the in­creas­ing num­ber of poly grads mak­ing it to lo­cal unis and the top cour­ses they are get­ting into, we have changed our minds,” said Mrs Mallika.</p>
    <p>More adults, in­clud­ing de­gree hold­ers, are en­rolling in the five poly­tech­nics here, a path­way pop­u­lar with N-level and O-level hold­ers as well as In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion (ITE) stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Fig­ures pro­vided by the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion to The Straits Times show that in 2019, 5,900 adults, in­clud­ing di­ploma, de­gree, master’s and PhD hold­ers, had en­rolled in the poly­tech­nics to take up spe­cialised and ad­vanced diplo­mas.</p>
    <p>Work­ing adults head­ing to the poly­tech­nics to up­grade their knowl­edge and skills say they suit them bet­ter as the cour­ses are more work-fo­cused and shorter.</p>
    <p>Mar­ket­ing man­ager Benny Tan, 46, who is look­ing to take up a spe­cial­ist di­ploma course in dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing, said: “The busi­ness de­gree I did cov­ered mar­ket­ing, but of course it was 20 years ago and quite dated.</p>
    <p>“So when I de­cided to do a course on dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing, I did my re­search and found the ones by the polys to be more work-rel­e­vant. So it made sense to head to a poly in­stead of one of the uni­ver­si­ties.”</p>
    <p>Sec­ondary school leavers who took ad­van­tage of spe­cial en­try schemes, such as the Poly­tech­nic Early Ad­mis­sions Ex­er­cise and Poly­tech­nic Foun­da­tion Pro­gramme, said they were thank­ful for the mul­ti­ple ad­mis­sion routes into the poly­tech­nics.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral of the new schemes look be­yond re­sults and take into ac­count a stu­dent’s in­ter­est and ap­ti­tude.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the Early Ad­mis­sions Ex­er­cise is an ap­ti­tude­based scheme that al­lows stu­dents to ap­ply for and re­ceive con­di­tional of­fers prior to re­ceiv­ing their fi­nal grades.</p>
    <p>The Foun­da­tional Pro­gramme is a one-year pro­gramme run by the poly­tech­nics as an al­ter­na­tive to the Sec­ondary 5 year for stu­dents in the Nor­mal (Aca­demic) stream.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, the ma­jor­ity of poly­tech­nic stu­dents were ad­mit­ted based on their O-level re­sults.</p>
    <p>Said 17-year-old Aileen Tan, who re­ceived an Early Ad­mis­sions Ex­er­cise of­fer to study de­sign at Te­masek Poly­tech­nic this year: “I don’t think I will be able to get into the course at Te­masek based on my re­sults alone. I’m glad that I was able to show my en­thu­si­asm and tal­ent in the field, through my port­fo­lio and in­ter­view.”</p>
    <p>She will be re­ceiv­ing her O-level re­sults to­day.</p>
    <p>Last year, more than 19,000 sec­ondary school leavers, ITE and Alevel grad­u­ates en­rolled in the poly­tech­nics. Of this num­ber, 10,600 were ad­mit­ted through the Joint Ad­mis­sions Ex­er­cise, which is held after the re­lease of the O-level re­sults in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>It also in­cluded 200 A-level hold­ers, a num­ber that has re­mained rel­a­tively sta­ble over the past few years.</p>
    <p>The oth­ers en­rolled were:</p>
    <p>• 4,400 ad­mit­ted through Early Ad­mis­sions Ex­er­cises for O-level stu­dents, ITE stu­dents and adults with at least two years of rel­e­vant work ex­pe­ri­ence;</p>
    <p>• 2,500 ad­mit­ted through the Joint Poly­tech­nic Ad­mis­sions Ex­er­cise for ITE grad­u­ates. They in­cluded 700 ad­mit­ted through the Di­rect En­try Scheme to Poly­tech­nic Pro­gramme, which al­lows Sec­ondary 4 Nor­mal (Aca­demic) stu­dents to first en­rol in a Higher Nitec course at ITE and then a poly­tech­nic course;</p>
    <p>• 1,400 ad­mit­ted through the Poly­tech­nic Foun­da­tion Pro­gramme, which is taught over two poly­tech­nic semesters.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents must pass all their Foun­da­tion Pro­gramme mod­ules to move on to the first year of their cour­ses. Stu­dents can ap­ply with their N-level and O-level re­sults.</p>
