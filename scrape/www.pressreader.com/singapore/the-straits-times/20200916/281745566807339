    <p>As mi­grant work­ers are re­housed ac­cord­ing to new rules to pre­vent Covid-19 trans­mis­sion, guide­lines have been set to help dor­mi­tory oper­a­tors and em­ploy­ers come to mu­tual agree­ment on ex­ist­ing rental con­tracts.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power, the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity and the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board said on Mon­day that they have asked that em­ploy­ers re­solve out­stand­ing rental ar­rears with dor­mi­tory oper­a­tors even if con­tracts have ex­pired, or if they want to ter­mi­nate or mod­ify ex­ist­ing con­tracts.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the pan­demic, many work­ers were moved from their dor­mi­to­ries to other tem­po­rary ac­com­mo­da­tion as the au­thor­i­ties fought to stem the out­break.</p>
    <p>The new guide­lines come as em­ploy­ers can choose to re­house their work­ers, for in­stance, so that those work­ing on the same project stay in the same place, or move them around within the same ac­com­mo­da­tion.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties sug­gested that em­ploy­ers dis­cuss with dor­mi­tory oper­a­tors how they can se­gre­gate work­ers along those lines, or con­sider the rea­son­able ter­mi­na­tion clauses if of­fered by the oper­a­tors.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties also asked dor­mi­tory oper­a­tors to con­sider allowing ex­ist­ing ten­ants to ter­mi­nate rental con­tracts early if the ten­ants pro­vide rea­son­able no­tice when mov­ing to other ac­com­mo­da­tion, and to waive ter­mi­na­tion penal­ties.</p>
    <p>Dor­mi­tory oper­a­tors are also en­cour­aged to al­low ex­ist­ing ten­ants to ter­mi­nate rental con­tracts with­out penal­ties if they are mov­ing to other rooms with dif­fer­ent rental rates but are in the same dor­mi­tory.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties pro­posed that oper­a­tors pro­vide some rental re­bate to em­ploy­ers who had tem­po­rar­ily moved their mi­grant work­ers to al­ter­na­tive non-gov­ern­ment ac­com­mo­da­tion, but con­tin­ued to pay for their dor­mi­tory ac­com­mo­da­tion with a view to re­turn­ing.</p>
    <p>“This takes into con­sid­er­a­tion that the op­er­a­tor would not have to in­cur util­i­ties and man­power costs to take care of the mi­grant work­ers who had tem­po­rar­ily moved out of the dor­mi­tory,” they added.</p>
    <p>“Sim­i­larly, em­ploy­ers are ad­vised to not de­mand for a full waiver of the rental fees as oper­a­tors in­cur costs in main­tain­ing the empty room dur­ing this pe­riod.”</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment agen­cies will mon­i­tor and re­view the ef­fec­tive­ness of the guide­lines, said the au­thor­i­ties, adding that steps will be taken to ex­pe­dite the process of group­ing work­ers and re­hous­ing them, if nec­es­sary.</p>
