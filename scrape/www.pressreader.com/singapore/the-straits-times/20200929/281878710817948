    <p>There’s lit­tle ques­tion that na­tional lead­ers ev­ery­where are on edge, and with good rea­son. The Covid-19 pan­demic has up­ended life for the mighty and the weak, rich and poor. Even those with ac­cess to the finest med­i­cal care have not been spared. In the United States, for in­stance, the ca­su­al­ties have included singer Trini Lopez and for­mer Repub­li­can pres­i­den­tial hope­ful Her­man Cain, who was hos­pi­talised less than two weeks af­ter at­tend­ing Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s June 20 cam­paign rally in Tulsa, Ok­la­homa. Tony Award-nom­i­nated Nick Cordero was only 41 when he died of com­pli­ca­tions from the virus. The list is long, and length­en­ing. US cases have now breached the seven mil­lion mark, a record.</p>
    <p>It is against this back­drop that Mr Trump, trail­ing in the polls against Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial chal­lenger Joe Bi­den, de­liv­ered his most re­cent anti-China com­ments. At the an­nual ses­sion of the United Na­tions Gen­eral Assem­bly, he re­turned to his “China virus” theme and called for China to be held ac­count­able for the Covid-19 plague af­fect­ing the world. Not sur­pris­ingly, China re­sponded strongly. Speak­ing in English to avoid any am­bi­gu­ity, its UN am­bas­sador Zhang Jun shot back that “enough is enough”. He said the US had cre­ated enough prob­lems for the world and re­minded it that even with the most ad­vanced med­i­cal tech­nolo­gies, it still had the most ca­su­al­ties and fa­tal­i­ties, and that if any­one is to be ac­count­able, it should be a few US politi­cians them­selves.</p>
    <p>There is lit­tle ques­tion the virus was first iden­ti­fied in China and that Bei­jing was slow to alert the world to its ram­i­fi­ca­tions. But the US, hav­ing the most ex­ten­sive in­tel­li­gence ser­vice avail­able, ei­ther did not have a good mea­sure of the po­ten­tial for the disease to spread, or the sci­en­tific ad­vice to mit­i­gate its threat. What emerged, in­stead, has been a se­ries of ex­ag­ger­a­tions about China and a prej­u­dice-tinged ap­proach to pan­demic con­trol that has been costly for the Amer­i­can peo­ple. Worse is to come. Na­tional In­sti­tute of Al­lergy and In­fec­tious Dis­eases di­rec­tor An­thony Fauci says the US faces a dif­fi­cult au­tumn and win­ter.</p>
    <p>US-China ties, in­creas­ingly prob­lem­atic as they have be­come, nev­er­the­less have to be con­ducted within the bounds of ci­vil­ity be­cause the reper­cus­sions glob­ally of their grow­ing ac­ri­mony will be se­vere. While us­ing a good-cop-bad-cop rou­tine in diplo­macy is a time-tested de­vice of gov­ern­ments, the stakes change when a head of state him­self hits out heav­ily and di­rectly. This can limit room for po­ten­tial rec­on­cil­i­a­tion and res­o­lu­tion, a win­dow that should never be closed off. China has, over the past decades, de­vel­oped a so­phis­ti­cated un­der­stand­ing of the US and its pro­cesses, and has been able to re­spond in a mea­sured way. Mr Trump’s Amer­ica needs to cal­i­brate its out­look and ap­proach, lest a fall­ing-out be­tween the two be­comes too dif­fi­cult to mend.</p>
