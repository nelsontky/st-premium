    <p>• Pros­e­cu­tors have asked Ja­pan’s former prime min­is­ter Shinzo Abe to re­port for vol­un­tary ques­tion­ing in a case they are build­ing against his sec­re­tary over un­re­ported po­lit­i­cal funds in­volv­ing as much as 40 mil­lion yen (S$513,000), the me­dia said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe, who stepped down due to ill health in Septem­ber, is un­der fire af­ter sources told the me­dia that his of­fice helped cover the costs of din­ner par­ties for sup­port­ers, a pos­si­ble vi­o­la­tion of fund­ing laws that con­flicts with Mr Abe’s ve­he­ment de­nials in Par­lia­ment last year.</p>
    <p>The scan­dal also threat­ens to em­broil Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga, who was widely seen as Mr Abe’s right-hand man dur­ing his ten­ure and has de­fended him in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe’s sec­re­tary is quoted as telling in­ves­ti­ga­tors that the in­come and ex­pen­di­tures “should have been in­cluded in the po­lit­i­cal fund­ing re­port” though “it was com­mon prac­tice not to”, ac­cord­ing to the Yomi­uri</p>
    <p>Shim­bun news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe’s of­fice did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to re­quests for com­ment, while a spokesman for the Tokyo District Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tors Of­fice said she was un­aware of the de­vel­op­ment and the of­fice would not make an­nounce­ments on any case while in­ves­ti­ga­tions were on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>Pros­e­cu­tors are build­ing their case on what they see as the fail­ure to re­port 14 mil­lion yen in five years’ worth of party at­tendee con­tri­bu­tions – via ticket sales – as both in­come and ex­pen­di­ture, as well as an ad­di­tional eight mil­lion yen that Mr Abe’s of­fice paid to cover short­falls in party costs that the con­tri­bu­tions did not cover, the Yomi­uri said. The news­pa­per did not iden­tify how the re­main­ing 18 mil­lion yen was spent.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe had re­peat­edly said in Par­lia­ment that “there was no in­come or ex­pen­di­ture that needed to be in­cluded in the po­lit­i­cal fund­ing re­port”, and de­nied his of­fice had cov­ered the gap be­tween ticket sales and the costs of the party.</p>
