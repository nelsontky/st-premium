    <p>LONDON • Ethiopia’s Ke­nenisa Bekele, the sec­ond-fastest man in his­tory over the dis­tance, has with­drawn from to­mor­row’s London Marathon with a calf in­jury, en­sur­ing there will be no show­down with world-record holder and long-time ri­val Eliud Kip­choge of Kenya.</p>
    <p>Bekele said he picked up the in­jury af­ter “two fast train­ing ses­sions too close to­gether”, leav­ing Kip­choge as an even hot­ter favourite to win his fifth ti­tle here.</p>
    <p>The closed-door race – which is open to only 100 elite-level com­peti­tors– will be run on a new, multi-lap course at St James’ Park.</p>
    <p>“I was in good shape but then, I picked up a nig­gle in my left calf in the last weeks of prepa­ra­tion,” Bekele said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“I have been hav­ing treat­ment ev­ery day since then and I truly be­lieved I would be ready but to­day, it is worse and I now know I can­not race on it.</p>
    <p>“This race was so im­por­tant to me. My time in Berlin (Septem­ber of) last year gave me great con­fi­dence and mo­ti­va­tion, and I was look­ing for­ward to show­ing that again.”</p>
    <p>Bekele’s time of 2hr 1min 41sec in Berlin was two sec­onds shy of Kip­choge’s world record set on the same course a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>“I know many peo­ple around the world have been look­ing for­ward to this race, and I am sorry to dis­ap­point my fans, the or­gan­is­ers and my fel­low com­peti­tors.” added the 38-year-old.</p>
    <p>“It has been a tough prepa­ra­tion time, with l ock­down, when I couldn’t have my team around me. I will take time to re­cover and be­come fit again and I hope to be back in London next year.”</p>
    <p>Kip­choge, 35, ran 1:59:40 in an un­of­fi­cial race in Vi­enna last Oc­to­ber – it did not count as a worl­drecord time due to the pres­ence of pace­mak­ers among other con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>With Covid-19 wip­ing out much of the year’s ath­let­ics pro­gramme, to­mor­row would have been their first race for a year, so London Marathon or­gan­is­ers were dis­ap­pointed to learn the big­gest pull for TV view­ers could not ma­te­ri­alise, but they talked up the qual­ity of the other com­peti­tors.</p>
    <p>“The world has been wait­ing to see this head-to-head (clash), but it will now not hap­pen this Sun­day,” said race di­rec­tor Hugh Brasher.</p>
    <p>“We know how dis­ap­pointed he (Bekele) is and we wish him a speedy re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>“This was never likely to be just a two-man race as we had four of the top-10 fastest marathon run­ners ever and six men in the field who have bro­ken 2:05, in­clud­ing (Ethiopi­ans) Mosinet Gere­mew and Mule Wasi­hun, sec­ond and third last year, and 2018 run­nerup Shura Ki­tata.”</p>
