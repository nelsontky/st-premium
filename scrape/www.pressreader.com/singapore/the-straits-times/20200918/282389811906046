    <p>Ed­i­tor-in-chief of Harper’s Bazaar Sin­ga­pore Ken­neth Goh turned down his big role three times.</p>
    <p>Once in 2006 when he was still a fash­ion direc­tor at the mag­a­zine, and on two more oc­ca­sions when two edi­tors came and went while he was a cre­ative direc­tor.</p>
    <p>In all three in­stances, he had not felt ready for the role. Pre­fer­ring the cre­ative pro­cess of styling, writ­ing and trav­el­ling to work with pro­duc­tion teams, he found an ed­i­tor’s job too desk-bound and “con­sumed with the busi­ness side of things”.</p>
    <p>“The fourth time, my then-pub­lisher told me ‘Look, Ken, I’m not go­ing to of­fer you this po­si­tion again. If you turn it down again, that’s it.’ So I took it,” Goh, who is in his 40s, tells The Straits Times with a sheep­ish grin.</p>
    <p>This year marks his 17th at Harper’s Bazaar, which re­cently saw a re­vamp for its print and dig­i­tal medi­ums.</p>
    <p>New to the web­site are a Bazaar Man sec­tion, a monthly guide that cu­rates for men “through a woman’s gaze”; and A Fash­ion­able Life, a se­ries that of­fers a glimpse into the lives and homes of per­son­al­i­ties and celebri­ties – in­spired by how “Covid-19 brought new in­ter­est in stylish women’s homes”, says Goh.</p>
    <p>The boy­ish ed­i­tor with his sig­na­ture bowl cut and avi­a­tor spec­ta­cles looks at home in Ion Or­chard, where this in­ter­view takes place, against the back­drop of lux­ury stores. Af­ter all, fash­ion is his big­gest pas­sion.</p>
    <p>He fell into the in­dus­try – and pub­lish­ing – quite nat­u­rally.</p>
    <p>The only child of for­mer news­pa­per jour­nal­ists – his mother, Ms Teresa Ooi, is in her 60s – Goh grew up with the sight of news­pa­pers and mag­a­zines strewn on the floor.</p>
    <p>“I come from news­pa­per stock,” he says. “I used to sit on my par­ents’ bed on Sun­day with crois­sants, coffee, tea and a mil­lion pa­pers all around us.”</p>
    <p>In 1985, the fam­ily mi­grated to Lon­don, where Goh com­pleted his pri­mary and sec­ondary ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Grow­ing up in 1990s Lon­don – liv­ing and breath­ing the English cap­i­tal’s fash­ion – shaped him. It was the era when Princess Diana was a global style icon, he re­calls, and her pic­tures “made the front page of ev­ery news­pa­per”.</p>
    <p>“My for­ma­tive years were in Lon­don, which was re­ally at the fore­front of jour­nal­ism and fash­ion in the 1990s. That was what in­formed my ca­reer goals, I think – be­ing im­mersed in Bri­tish pop cul­ture,” he adds, a slight Bri­tish ac­cent lin­ger­ing to­day.</p>
    <p>He had hoped to en­rol in art school Cen­tral Saint Martins in Lon­don to study fash­ion, but this fell through when he had to re­turn to Sin­ga­pore to do na­tional ser­vice. He ended up study­ing mass com­mu­ni­ca­tions and jour­nal­ism at the Univer­sity of Lon­don.</p>
    <p>Un­able to se­cure a fash­ion in­tern­ship in Lon­don upon grad­u­at­ing, he re­turned to Sin­ga­pore to work.</p>
    <p>He landed his first full-time job as a writer and stylist at Lime mag­a­zine, work­ing un­der play­wright and then ed­i­to­rial direc­tor of Me­di­a­corp Pub­lish­ing Michael Chiang.</p>
    <p>His pub­lish­ing ca­reer took him to var­i­ous other glossies, in­clud­ing Elle mag­a­zine and 8 Days, be­fore he joined Harper’s Bazaar in 2003 – three years af­ter the in­ter­na­tional fash­ion ti­tle was launched in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The pre­vi­ous fash­ion direc­tor was Aus­tralian, and Goh was brought in to give “a high-fash­ion point of view with a dis­tinct un­der­stand­ing of the Sin­ga­pore mar­ket” and en­gage the lo­cal fash­ion com­mu­nity in shoots and fea­tures.</p>
    <p>In 2013, the mag­a­zine launched the Harper’s Bazaar Asia NewGen Fash­ion Award, to nur­ture and de­velop fash­ion tal­ent across Asia. The awards will re­turn in a non­com­pet­i­tive for­mat this year, to in­stead cel­e­brate and up­lift the past Sin­ga­pore win­ners.</p>
    <p>THE ORIG­I­NAL IN­FLU­ENCER</p>
    <p>While so­cial me­dia has of­ten been de­scribed as a dou­ble-edged sword in the pub­lish­ing world, Goh be­lieves it has only helped him in his jour­ney.</p>
    <p>In fact, it was what gave him the con­fi­dence to fi­nally ac­cept the role of ed­i­tor-in-chief in 2014, says Goh, who to­day strad­dles both the tra­di­tional me­dia and in­flu­encer worlds, with a mod­est fol­low­ing of his own on In­sta­gram (33,400 fol­low­ers at @ken­nieboy).</p>
    <p>“By then, the l and­scape had changed sig­nif­i­cantly – so­cial me­dia was re­ally be­gin­ning to gain trac­tion and I felt that I could be a lot more of a cre­ative ed­i­tor-in-chief.”</p>
    <p>He launched Bazaar’s In­sta­gram in 2012 and its web­site in 2014.</p>
    <p>Then there was his un­nerv­ing but mean­ing­ful stint on tele­vi­sion. He re­calls with ap­pre­hen­sion be­ing “sud­denly pushed in front of the cam­era” for reality tele­vi­sion show Asia’s Next Top Model (2012 to 2018), for which Harper’s Bazaar was the of­fi­cial me­dia part­ner.</p>
    <p>Cri­tiquing mod­els as a guest judge on live tele­vi­sion was no easy job, says Goh.</p>
    <p>Be­cause each model rep­re­sented her coun­try, his crit­i­cism some­times ruf­fled the feath­ers of view­ers and their strong “na­tion­al­ist spirit”.</p>
    <p>“The show be­came like the mod­el­ling equiv­a­lent of Miss Uni­verse,” he says.</p>
    <p>Fac­ing haters, he had to de­ac­ti­vate his so­cial me­dia af­ter the first sea­son aired be­cause ne­ti­zens started ha­rass­ing him and his loved ones on­line.</p>
    <p>“Sud­denly you’ve got an au­di­ence that fol­lows the model or the show be­cause he wants to root for his coun­try. I was fac­ing a very new, young au­di­ence whose un­der­stand­ing of fash­ion was very dif­fer­ent from what I was used to.”</p>
    <p>But along with bat­tle scars and thick­ened skin, the show left him new take­aways – like re­al­is­ing what young au­di­ences around the world wanted in fash­ion. Namely, in­flu­encers.</p>
    <p>Youth looked up to them and fash­ion de­sign­ers he met at the NewGen Fash­ion Awards wanted to dress them, Goh says.</p>
    <p>“I re­alised that these in­flu­encers are able to cut across so many mar­kets and re­gions be­cause they have that global in­flu­ence – which no ti­tle in Sin­ga­pore has.”</p>
    <p>He linked up with In­sta­gram It girls Nicole Warne (for­merly @garypep­per­girl) and Irene Kim (@ireneis­good), invit­ing them to be men­tors and guest judges at the NewGen Fash­ion Awards.</p>
    <p>In re­turn, they were be­stowed mag­a­zine cov­ers.</p>
    <p>Asked if he views him­self as an in­flu­encer, Goh squirms and an­swers: “I see my­self as more of a per­son of in­flu­ence.”</p>
    <p>“In­flu­ence can come i n your thought pro­cess, one-on-one en­gage­ment; it can come in the way I en­gage with brands be­hind the scenes,” says Goh, who has been ap­proached nu­mer­ous times as an un­of­fi­cial fash­ion con­sul­tant by brands look­ing to en­ter the Sin­ga­pore mar­ket.</p>
    <p>One such brand was footwear la­bel Roger Vivier from the Tod’s Group, which con­sulted him on en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore in 2013; it now has a store in Ngee Ann City.</p>
    <p>And when Ion Or­chard was first built in 2009, in­ter­na­tional brands sought his opin­ion on hav­ing a store pres­ence at the new mall.</p>
    <p>“That’s the pri­vate side of in­flu­ence. I’ve been very for­tu­nate in help­ing to, I guess, con­trib­ute to the fash­ion l and­scape i n Sin­ga­pore over the past 20 years.”</p>
    <p>These days, he is busy with pro­duc­ing stay-home con­tent for Bazaar’s In­sta­gram – part­ner­ing with crafts­men, artists and in­flu­encers – to make quar­an­tine life more en­gag­ing.</p>
    <p>Re­flect­ing on his colour­ful ca­reer, Goh counts the many travel op­por­tu­ni­ties (he has been flown to Cuba, Mau­ri­tius and Mar­rakesh on var­i­ous press jun­kets) and in­ter­view­ing fash­ion leg­end, the late Karl Lager­feld, in 2013 as some of his per­sonal ca­reer highs.</p>
    <p>Yet what he misses most is styling shoots – “the pro­cess of cre­at­ing movie sce­nar­ios with lights, fash­ion, bril­liant hair and make-up”.</p>
    <p>He has styled and shot de­signer and for­mer Spice Girl Vic­to­ria Beck­ham in Lon­don, pop star Janet Jack­son i n Tokyo and su­per­model Cindy Crawford twice – in Kuala Lumpur and Los An­ge­les.</p>
    <p>“I think my ca­reer goal would be to style Bey­once,” he fin­ishes with a laugh. “That would be fas­ci­nat­ing.”</p>
