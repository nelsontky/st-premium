    <p>In Septem­ber, for­mer for­eign do­mes­tic worker Parti Liyani be­came a house­hold name when she was ac­quit­ted of steal­ing from her wealthy and pow­er­ful em­ployer.</p>
    <p>She also be­came a sym­bol of per­ceived in­jus­tice in the way the less ad­van­taged were treated in the le­gal sys­tem.</p>
    <p>The case, which bore the hall­marks of a David and Go­liath story, gained promi­nence as Sin­ga­pore­ans grap­pled with the ques­tion of whether a cor­po­rate big­wig held sway over how his maid was in­ves­ti­gated and pros­e­cuted.</p>
    <p>It snow­balled from a seem­ingly sim­ple case of theft i nto a marathon nine-hour par­lia­men­tary de­bate last month about the fair­ness of the crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti used to work for for­mer Changi Airport Group chair­man Liew Mun Leong, who was also on the board of gov­ern­ment-linked en­ti­ties such as in­fra­struc­ture con­sul­tancy Sur­bana Jurong and Te­masek Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber 2016, Mr Liew de­cided to ter­mi­nate her em­ploy­ment while he was overseas.</p>
    <p>On Oct 28, 2016, his son Karl told Ms Parti that she was fired. Given two hours to pack, she ut­tered a threat to lodge a com­plaint with the Man­power Min­istry.</p>
    <p>Two days later, while she was back in In­done­sia, Mr Liew Mun Leong and his son made a po­lice re­port after the fam­ily opened the three boxes that the younger man had agreed to ship to her.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti was ar­rested after she re­turned to Sin­ga­pore in De­cem­ber that year.</p>
    <p>She was housed by non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion Humanitari­an Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Mi­gra­tion Eco­nomics (Home), which sought le­gal rep­re­sen­ta­tion for her.</p>
    <p>Lawyer Anil Balchan­dani agreed to act for Ms Parti un­der the Law So­ci­ety’s Crim­i­nal Le­gal Aid Scheme.</p>
    <p>Charged with steal­ing more than $50,000 worth of items, in­clud­ing luxury watches and brand-name bags, Ms Parti fought the charges in a State Courts trial that stretched over more than 20 days.</p>
    <p>She con­tended that some of the items were found in the trash, some were bought by her and some were given to her.</p>
    <p>District Judge Olivia Low did not com­pletely ac­cept the tes­ti­mony of Karl Liew, who claimed that items such as women’s clothes be­longed to him. But she found that the pros­e­cu­tion had proved its case beyond rea­son­able doubt, and con­victed Ms Parti of steal­ing $34,000 worth of items.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti ap­pealed to the High Court. In Septem­ber, Jus­tice Chan Seng Onn ac­quit­ted her of all four charges after con­clud­ing that the con­vic­tions were un­safe.</p>
    <p>Among other things, he found that the po­lice’s de­lay in vis­it­ing the crime scene cre­ated a rea­son­able doubt as to whether the pho­to­graphs taken by in­ves­ti­ga­tors some five weeks later ac­cu­rately doc­u­mented the items i n the boxes.</p>
    <p>He also sin­gled out Karl Liew for his “dis­hon­esty” on the stand.</p>
    <p>The cir­cum­stances of the case sparked a pub­lic out­cry, with on­line chat­ter dwelling on whether Mr Liew Mun Leong’s so­cial sta­tus had bi­ased the ini­tial di­rec­tion of the case.</p>
    <p>Less than a week after Ms Parti’s ac­quit­tal, Mr Liew an­nounced his de­ci­sion to step down from his var­i­ous po­si­tions. He said he re­spected the court’s de­ci­sion but stressed he made a po­lice re­port be­cause he be­lieved it was his civic duty to re­port sus­pi­cions of wrong­do­ing .</p>
    <p>On Nov 4, Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam spoke in Par­lia­ment for more than two hours on the case, pro­vid­ing new in­for­ma­tion that emerged from an in­ter­nal re­view.</p>
    <p>He cat­e­gor­i­cally said there was no at­tempt by any­one to ex­ert in­flu­ence on the in­ves­ti­ga­tors or pros­e­cu­tors – the Liews’ po­lice re­port was han­dled as a rou­tine theft case.</p>
    <p>There was also suf­fi­cient ev­i­dence and good rea­sons to pros­e­cute Ms Parti, as she had ad­mit­ted to tak­ing some items of cloth­ing with­out per­mis­sion, among other things, he added.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter also said lapses were found in the in­ves­ti­ga­tion process, and dis­ci­plinary ac­tion was be­ing taken against the of­fi­cer con­cerned and his su­per­vi­sor.</p>
    <p>The House also de­bated a mo­tion put for­ward by Work­ers’ Party chair­man Sylvia Lim on im­prov­ing the crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem after</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam’s state­ment.</p>
    <p>Karl Liew was charged in court the next day with per­jury and fur­nish­ing false in­for­ma­tion to the po­lice, of­fences that carry pos­si­ble jail terms.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti’s four-year le­gal saga is far from over, al­though she is now the one in the driver’s seat. The two pros­e­cu­tors who han­dled her trial are now the sub­ject of un­prece­dented dis­ci­plinary pro­ceed­ings against le­gal ser­vice of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>Her com­plaint of mis­con­duct cen­tred on how they car­ried out a demon­stra­tion of a faulty DVD player dur­ing the court trial.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti is also seek­ing com­pen­sa­tion from the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers for al­leged “friv­o­lous or vex­a­tious” pros­e­cu­tion, es­chew­ing the op­tion of ap­proach­ing the Liews to re­coup four years of salary.</p>
    <p>Mr Balchan­dani made it clear that she was not merely after mone­tary com­pen­sa­tion, but was seek­ing “a nom­i­nal amount to show that some­thing went wrong”.</p>
