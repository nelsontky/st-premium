    <p>BEI­JING/NAN­JING • China is plan­ning to vac­ci­nate 50 mil­lion peo­ple in the high-pri­or­ity group against the coro­n­avirus be­fore the start of the peak Chi­nese New Year travel sea­son early next year, the South China Morn­ing Post re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing is plan­ning to dis­trib­ute 100 mil­lion doses of the vac­cines made by Chi­nese firms Sinopharm and Si­no­vac Biotech, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>China has granted emer­gency use sta­tus to two can­di­date vac­cines from Sinopharm and one from Si­no­vac Biotech.</p>
    <p>It has ap­proved a fourth, from CanSino Bi­o­log­ics, for mil­i­tary use.</p>
    <p>The South China Morn­ing Post re­port said that Chi­nese of­fi­cials have been asked to com­plete the first 50 mil­lion doses by Jan 15 and the sec­ond by Feb 5.</p>
    <p>The mass in­oc­u­la­tion for high­pri­or­ity groups aims to re­duce the risks of the spread of the disease dur­ing the an­nual week-long hol­i­day, the re­port added.</p>
    <p>The high-pri­or­ity group in­cludes health work­ers, po­lice of­fi­cers, fire­fight­ers, Cus­toms of­fi­cers, cargo han­dlers, as well as trans­port and lo­gis­tics work­ers.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, China’s Sichuan province could start vac­ci­nat­ing the elderly and peo­ple with un­der­ly­ing con­di­tions at the be­gin­ning of next month, af­ter it com­pletes in­oc­u­la­tions for pri­or­ity groups, of­fi­cials have said.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials said on Thurs­day that 118,000 vac­cine doses had ar­rived in the province so far, with plans to in­oc­u­late all high-risk groups by</p>
    <p>Feb 5 be­fore rolling out the pro­gramme to the rest of the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus, which first emerged in China late last year, has largely been brought un­der con­trol in the coun­try, but there have been a se­ries of do­mes­tic out­breaks.</p>
    <p>Sichuan has been hit by a small clus­ter of Covid-19 cases in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>As of yes­ter­day noon, China has re­ported a cu­mu­la­tive 94,734 con­firmed Covid-19 cases, with 4,759 deaths, ac­cord­ing to data com­piled by Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, in east­ern Jiangsu province, the au­thor­i­ties said sam­ples col­lected from the pack­ag­ing of im­ported frozen hair­tail fish have tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Wuxi city’s Covid-19 preven­tion and con­trol of­fice said they de­tected the coro­n­avirus in the pack­ag­ing sam­ples taken from the hair­tail stored in a lo­cal food shop.</p>
    <p>The batch of fish had been im­ported from Myan­mar.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have sealed rel­e­vant prod­ucts that have been traced, and dis­in­fected the fa­cil­i­ties and ve­hi­cles used to store and trans­port the prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 17 peo­ple who came into con­tact with the con­tam­i­nated pack­ag­ing are cur­rently un­der iso­lated ob­ser­va­tion and have all tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Trans­port re­leased a guide­line in mid-Novem­ber to pre­vent the trans­mis­sion of Covid-19 through cold-chain food im­ported via roads and wa­ter­ways.</p>
