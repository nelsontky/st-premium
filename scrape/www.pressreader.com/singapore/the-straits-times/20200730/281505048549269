    <p>Na­tional sports agency Sport Sin­ga­pore (SportSG) has suspended the Ac­tiveSG mem­ber­ship ac­counts of play­ers from a so­cial bad­minton group that flouted safe man­age­ment mea­sures on June 22.</p>
    <p>The group of 29 peo­ple, one of whom was a Covid-19 pa­tient, had not fol­lowed safe dis­tanc­ing rules and in­ter-min­gled across the courts dur­ing their three-hour ses­sion at Jurong East Sport Hall.</p>
    <p>On June 28, SportSG no­ti­fied the play­ers of the sus­pen­sion via e-mail.</p>
    <p>A SportSG spokesman said yes­ter­day the users’ ac­counts will re­main suspended “un­til the rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties com­plete the in­ves­ti­ga­tions”.</p>
    <p>This means they will not be able to make book­ings or have ac­cess to all Ac­tiveSG fa­cil­i­ties for the time be­ing, in­clud­ing the na­tional sports move­ment’s sports halls, swim­ming com­plexes, gyms and fit­ness stu­dios.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral mem­bers of the group have ap­pealed to SportSG, say­ing that they had not in­ten­tion­ally breached the rules. The or­gan­iser, who de­clined to be named, wrote to SportSG on July 24 to ap­peal against the sus­pen­sion.</p>
    <p>He told The Straits Times: “Whether we com­mit­ted any wrong­do­ing or not, we are all suspended. We also didn’t do it on pur­pose. The rules weren’t very clear. I saw the guide­lines and they were changed again for bad­minton, which shows that they weren’t very clear.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter the in­ci­dent, SportSG in­tro­duced new mea­sures such as the manda­tory wear­ing of wrist­bands to iden­tify peo­ple from dif­fer­ent courts to curb the spread of the coron­avirus.</p>
    <p>But SportSG said yes­ter­day that the safe man­age­ment mea­sures, in­clud­ing the one ban­ning the in­ter-mix­ing of groups, were clearly spelt out in its ad­vi­sory and at its fa­cil­i­ties. The agency warned that it will “act against er­rant users who have in­fringed the reg­u­la­tions”, in­clud­ing bar­ring them from the use of Ac­tiveSG fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­iser said that he had waited a month to ap­proach SportSG as he was await­ing the swab test re­sults of those who were tested. About half of them were tested and all had re­ceived neg­a­tive re­sults for Covid-19, he added.</p>
    <p>A group mem­ber who also did not want to be named said the de­ci­sion was too harsh, as sports fa­cil­i­ties had only re­opened on June 19, a few days be­fore the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>SportSG said on July 18 that there had been about 1,000 cases of safe man­age­ment vi­o­la­tions at Ac­tiveSG fa­cil­i­ties since they re­opened in phase two.</p>
    <p>The mem­ber re­counted that the safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sador at Jurong East Sport Hall had re­minded some in the group to rest or warm up out­side the hall if they were not us­ing the courts, but did not men­tion any­thing about in­ter-mix­ing.</p>
    <p>While news of the sus­pen­sion was some­what ex­pected, he said that SportSG could have en­gaged the play­ers in its in­ves­ti­ga­tion of the in­ci­dent be­fore met­ing out the pu­n­ish­ment.</p>
    <p>“If only they had given us the (chance to give a) proper state­ment and called us to tell us why we were suspended and at least hear our side so that when they do choose, they would have made all con­sid­er­a­tions.”</p>
    <p>Whether we com­mit­ted any wrong­do­ing or not, we are all suspended. We also didn’t do it on ’’ pur­pose. THE GROUP OR­GAN­ISER, who de­clined to be named.</p>
