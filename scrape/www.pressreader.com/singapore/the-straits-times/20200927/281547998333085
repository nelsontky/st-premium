    <p>• Manch­ester United man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer ad­mit­ted that his team were lucky to clinch all three points yes­ter­day af­ter beat­ing Brighton 3-2 at the very last sec­ond, and said that the Red Devils have plenty of work to do.</p>
    <p>Bruno Fer­nan­des scored a penalty, awarded fol­low­ing a video as­sis­tant ref­eree (VAR) re­view af­ter the fi­nal whis­tle had been blown, as United rode their luck at the Amex Sta­dium to reg­is­ter their first Premier League points of the sea­son. Speak­ing to BT Sport af­ter the game, Sol­sk­jaer said: “We got away with one. Maybe one point we de­served, we didn’t de­serve more. But the char­ac­ter de­served more.</p>
    <p>“Last sea­son we had too many draws, so that is a big plus for us.</p>
    <p>“They are a dif­fi­cult team to play against. We don’t have the legs and sharp­ness but we will get there. We have plenty of work ahead.”</p>
    <p>The Seag­ulls hit the wood­work five times and thought they had earned a de­served point when Solly March headed home to equalise in the 95th minute.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Neal Mau­pay’s hand­ball was pe­nalised by ref­eree Chris Ka­vanagh af­ter he had blown for full-time and Fer­nan­des con­verted from the spot in the 100th minute.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Opta sta­tis­tics, the Por­tuguese play­maker’s goal at 99 min­utes 45 sec­onds is the lat­est scored in the Premier League since Juan Mata’s strike for Chelsea against Nor­wich in Au­gust 2011 (100min 3sec).</p>
    <p>Luck aside, United were slug­gish. It took them 33 min­utes to muster a flow­ing move in­volv­ing the front three of Mar­cus Rash­ford, An­thony Mar­tial, and Mason Greenwood, who scored but his goal was ruled out for off­side against Rash­ford.</p>
    <p>Brighton opened the scor­ing when Tariq Lamptey burst into the box from right wing­back and was clipped by Fer­nan­des. Mau­pay con­verted the penalty with a cheeky chip down the mid­dle of the goal.</p>
    <p>The lead lasted just three min­utes as, from a fiercely driven Fer­nan­des free kick, Lewis Dunk turned the ball into his own net.</p>
    <p>The VAR came to the res­cue of both sides within the first 10 min­utes of the sec­ond half.</p>
    <p>United thought they had given a away a sec­ond spot kick of the match when Paul Pogba was pe­nalised for pulling back Aaron Con­nolly. How­ever, Ka­vanagh over­turned his ini­tial de­ci­sion when he saw a re­play of the in­ci­dent. At the other end, Rash­ford swept home Greenwood’s low cross but the VAR ruled against United with the scorer marginally off­side.</p>
    <p>There was no stop­ping Rash­ford mo­ments later when he raced onto Fer­nan­des’ ball over the top and, with a de­flected ef­fort, the ball found the top cor­ner.</p>
    <p>The Seag­ulls seemed to fi­nally have their re­ward when March ghosted in at the back post to head home Alireza Ja­han­bakash’s cross.</p>
    <p>But, in a chaotic fi­nale, Harry Maguire’s header from a cor­ner struck Mau­pay’s arm. Fer­nan­des stayed cool to en­sure United es­caped with all three points.</p>
    <p>Brighton boss Gra­ham Pot­ter told BBC Sport: “It’s a sore one, to say the least. Some­times life isn’t fair and it feels like that at the mo­ment. I don’t know what the shot count (18-7) was but we were dom­i­nant. We de­served some­thing from the game to say the least.”</p>
    <p>In the later match, the VAR was a cen­tral fig­ure again, as Ever­ton were awarded a penalty af­ter Crys­tal Palace’s Joel Ward was ad­judged to have han­dled in the area.</p>
    <p>Richarli­son fired home from the spot to seal Ever­ton’s 2-1 win at Sel­hurst Park, main­tain­ing their 100 per cent record this sea­son.</p>
    <p>SCOR­ING THE KEY, BAR NONE</p>
    <p>Brighton did very well... Maybe they de­served more. The point is to score goals not hit the bar.</p>
    <p>BRUNO FER­NAN­DES, Manch­ester United mid­fielder, af­ter the hosts’ Le­an­dro Trossard (thrice), Adam Webster and Solly March all hit the wood­work.</p>
    <p>HEART­BREAK­ING LOSS</p>
    <p>It’s a sore one, to say the least. Some­times life isn’t fair and it feels like that at the mo­ment.</p>
    <p>GRA­HAM POT­TER, Brighton boss, af­ter see­ing his side take 18 shots to United’s seven. The visi­tors scored from all three of their shots on tar­get.</p>
