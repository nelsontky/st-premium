    <p>ByteDance, the Chi­nese owner of video app TikTok, is mov­ing to a big­ger of­fice in Sin­ga­pore’s fi­nan­cial dis­trict, paving the way for it to make the city-state its beach­head for the rest of Asia. It has signed an agree­ment to lease three floors mea­sur­ing over 60,000 sq ft at One Raf­fles Quay, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the plan.</p>
    <p>ByteDance’s of­fice ex­pan­sion will help the world’s most richly val­ued start-up to an­chor it­self in Sin­ga­pore, where it plans to in­vest sev­eral bil­lion dol­lars. The move will sup­port the com­pany’s hir­ing spree, as it plans to add hun­dreds of jobs over the next three years i n the city state, the peo­ple have said.</p>
    <p>Con­trolled by bil­lion­aire Zhang Yim­ing, the firm is push­ing its so­cial me­dia ser­vice across Asia fol­low­ing set­backs in In­dia, Bri­tain and the United States, where Chi­nese tech com­pa­nies are fac­ing grow­ing hos­til­ity amid se­cu­rity con­cerns.</p>
    <p>The new of­fice is be­ing re­fur­bished and it is likely that em­ploy­ees will move in by the first quar­ter of next year and will be in­formed about it later this month or next month, the peo­ple said. A ByteDance rep­re­sen­ta­tive de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese tech firm’s move in Sin­ga­pore co­in­cides with other tech gi­ants’ plans. Ama­zon is set to move to a larger of­fice space in the city’s fi­nan­cial dis­trict. Ten­cent Hold­ings is also set­ting up a re­gional head­quar­ters in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is seen as an at­trac­tive base for both West­ern and Asian firms be­cause of its po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity and de­vel­oped fi­nan­cial and le­gal sys­tem, espe­cially as its ri­val Hong Kong is still grap­pling with up­heaval and China’s tight­en­ing grip.</p>
    <p>ByteDance’s move to One Raf­fles Quay – which is j ointly owned by Hong Kong Land Hold­ings, Kep­pel Reit and Sun­tec Reit – will be a boost to the of­fice build­ing since its an­chor ten­ant UBS Group is mov­ing out, hav­ing se­cured another of­fice space to con­sol­i­date its op­er­a­tions in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>ByteDance now has a shared space on one of the floors in Asia Square Tower 1, which is owned by Qatar’s sov­er­eign wealth fund.</p>
    <p>The tech firm cur­rently has more than 200 job open­ings in Sin­ga­pore, for po­si­tions from data an­a­lyst to prod­uct pol­icy and le­gal coun­sel. Some of the po­si­tions are based in the city but will deal with is­sues in other South-east Asian coun­tries, ac­cord­ing to its ca­reer site.</p>
