    <p>The Singapore Ex­change (SGX) is launch­ing Asia’s first in­ter­na­tional real es­tate in­vest­ment trust (Reit) fu­tures – SGX FTSE EPRA Nareit Asia ex-Ja­pan In­dex Fu­tures – track­ing di­verse trusts listed in Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Thai­land, to­gether with SGX iEdge S-Reit Lead­ers In­dex Fu­tures.</p>
    <p>To­day’s launch comes on the heels of last Thurs­day’s an­nounce­ment of a tie-up with the Lon­don Stock Ex­change-owned FTSE to de­velop and mar­ket a multi-as­set in­dex de­riv­a­tives of­fer­ing fo­cus­ing on Asian and emerg­ing mar­kets.</p>
    <p>The SGX and FTSE Rus­sell will roll out new fixed in­come, listed real es­tate, global eq­ui­ties and cur­rency prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>In June, the SGX launched a blue-chip sin­gle stock fu­tures which has been well re­ceived by the mar­ket. Late last month, it launched the SGX FTSE Tai­wan In­dex Fu­tures, whose daily vol­ume has crossed 20,000 con­tracts, reach­ing al­most US$1 bil­lion (S$1.37 bil­lion) in daily value. Open in­ter­est is now over US$420 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>All this ac­tiv­ity comes just three months af­ter a shock an­nounce­ment by long-term part­ner MSCI that it would mi­grate its suite of 37 MSCI fu­tures and op­tions con­tracts to Hong Kong in Fe­bru­ary next year.</p>
    <p>News of the loss of these lu­cra­tive con­tracts sent SGX shares plung­ing the most in 17 years, wip­ing out around $2 bil­lion from its mar­ket cap. On its part, SGX guided for a 10 per cent to 15 per cent im­pact on its 2021 profit on a pro forma ba­sis, in the ab­sence of mit­i­gat­ing ac­qui­si­tions.</p>
    <p>As ex­pected, an­a­lysts were quick to down­grade the stock.</p>
    <p>Well, events of the past two months show that the mit­i­gat­ing ac­qui­si­tions and deals are be­gin­ning to hap­pen. And the mar­ket has re­sponded, push­ing SGX to $8.68 last week de­spite gen­er­ally weak and volatile mar­ket con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>But the mar­ket is given to of­ten com­par­ing SGX some­what un­favourably with its coun­ter­part in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Ex­change (HKEX) is per­ceived, rightly, as be­ing bet­ter po­si­tioned to serve a mas­sive North-east Asian mar­ket an­chored by China.</p>
    <p>One can spill a lot of ink writ­ing about how it stands to ben­e­fit from Chi­nese cor­po­rate fund raising via the ter­ri­tory. HKEX is also a larger de­riv­a­tives mar­ket com­pared with SGX at the mo­ment.</p>
    <p>But SGX sits at the epi­cen­tre of a thriv­ing South-east Asian re­gion, which has be­come in­creas­ingly prom­i­nent as a des­ti­na­tion for global funds and cor­po­ra­tions amid the un­cer­tain­ties aris­ing from the geopo­lit­i­cal jostling be­tween the West and China.</p>
    <p>In re­cent months, global banks have also iden­ti­fied this re­gion as the next global tech hot spot and a po­ten­tial base for funds seek­ing to hedge their bets and bases.</p>
    <p>In the wake of the MSCI an­nounce­ment, I asked SGX chief ex­ec­u­tive Loh Boon Chye what his plans were to meet the chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>With­out go­ing into specifics, he re­sponded that moves were un­der way to ac­cel­er­ate the roll-out of a “di­ver­si­fied pan-Asian multi-as­set strat­egy with bolt-on ac­qui­si­tions”. Be­sides adding more prod­ucts into the cash mar­ket, the strat­egy also in­cludes broad­en­ing and deep­en­ing Asian cov­er­age by de­vel­op­ing more de­riv­a­tive prod­ucts both on its own or via col­lab­o­ra­tion with other part­ners. Key among these is to build a suite of fixed in­come prod­ucts, while grow­ing its mar­ket data and in­dex busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Ac­tu­ally, work on this started as early as the mid­dle of last year.</p>
    <p>Since the start of the last fi­nan­cial year on July 1, 2019, SGX has been re­or­gan­is­ing its busi­nesses to grow and scale its as­set classes. This in­cludes merg­ing its cash eq­ui­ties with eq­uity de­riv­a­tives to form an en­larged eq­uity plat­form.</p>
    <p>Its fixed in­come, cur­ren­cies and com­modi­ties (FICC) unit has seen rev­enue in­crease 23 per cent year on year to $171.4 mil­lion, ac­count­ing for 16 per cent of to­tal rev­enue.</p>
    <p>The data, con­nec­tiv­ity and in­dices (DCI) rev­enue in the 2020 fi­nan­cial year in­creased 19 per cent to $121.6 mil­lion, ac­count­ing for 12 per cent of to­tal turnover. Its Jan­uary ac­qui­si­tion of Sci­en­tific Beta bol­stered its grow­ing in­dex busi­ness, con­tribut­ing $14.4 mil­lion in rev­enue this year.</p>
    <p>The ex­panded range of prod­ucts, plat­forms and ca­pa­bil­i­ties en­abled SGX rev­enue to cross $1 bil­lion for this year, its high­est since list­ing in Novem­ber 2000. Its div­i­dend pay­out rose to 30.5 cents, up from 30 cents in the pre­vi­ous fi­nan­cial year.</p>
    <p>SGX plans to dou­ble its FICC and DCI pil­lars in five years’ time.</p>
    <p>As I’ve stated in pre­vi­ous col­umns – in­clud­ing the week when SGX shares were smashed fol­low­ing the MSCI news – in­vestors who have watched the firm over the past two decades would know that it is an in­sti­tu­tion with the DNA to build pi­o­neer­ing prod­ucts when it mat­tered.</p>
    <p>HKEX is in­deed well po­si­tioned to serve North-east Asia and ben­e­fit from China. But given un­ex­pected and volatile de­vel­op­ments on the geopo­lit­i­cal front, there are now le­git­i­mate con­cerns about Hong</p>
    <p>Kong’s longer-term stand­ing as the pre­mier Asian fi­nan­cial hub.</p>
    <p>But that does not mean SGX will have it easy.</p>
    <p>Given the global pan­demic, un­cer­tain geopol­i­tics and the dis­con­nect be­tween Wall Street and Main Street, there is a risk of mas­sive global volatil­ity in eq­uity mar­kets. Any re­sul­tant pull­back in vol­umes could im­pact SGX’s bot­tom line and busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Also, its am­bi­tion of tie-ups with Asian ex­changes is un­likely to be re­alised any time soon, given the na­tion­al­is­tic pri­or­i­ties of neigh­bour­ing coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, SGX has been able to com­mand a high trans­ac­tion fee struc­ture thanks to its mo­nop­oly here. But given Singapore’s knack for un­ex­pect­edly open­ing up var­i­ous sec­tors to global com­pe­ti­tion, this may not last for­ever. The ex­change needs to pre­pare for such even­tu­al­i­ties.</p>
    <p>SGX also needs to ex­am­ine where and why it is fall­ing short on at­tract­ing qual­ity list­ings. This year, it has at­tracted a frac­tion of the new list­ings HKEX has gar­nered.</p>
    <p>But as I have said in pre­vi­ous col­umns, money knows no loy­alty and sen­ti­ment can be fickle. And his­tory has shown that tides – and trades – can shift quickly. The mar­ket is mer­i­to­cratic and money man­agers know that di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion is a hall­mark of risk man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>For the mo­ment, SGX seems to be do­ing the right things. And do­ing them right.</p>
