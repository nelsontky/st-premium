    <p>Google suf­fered an hour-long global out­age yes­ter­day morn­ing that af­fected many of its ser­vices, in­clud­ing e-mail, cal­en­dar, chat and video­con­fer­enc­ing.</p>
    <p>The dis­rup­tion hit users at a time when they needed the tools the most to stay pro­duc­tive amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It is also the sec­ond time in less than two months that Google ser­vices were down.</p>
    <p>From around 9am yes­ter­day, many users, in­clud­ing in Sin­ga­pore, had trou­ble send­ing e-mails via Gmail, while oth­ers had to en­dure lengthy waits to load their in­boxes.</p>
    <p>Pri­vate ed­u­ca­tor Gwen­do­line Quek, 38, had is­sues with Gmail for about 20 min­utes.</p>
    <p>“My e-mails re­fused to go out, they kept get­ting stuck in the out­box. It was very frus­trat­ing be­cause I had some ur­gent mes­sages I needed to send out,” she told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Google con­firmed on its sta­tus dash­board at 9.30am yes­ter­day that it was aware of prob­lems with a num­ber of its ser­vices.</p>
    <p>At 10.07am, it posted an up­date to say all prob­lems should be re­solved.</p>
    <p>The tech gi­ant apol­o­gised for the in­con­ve­nience and said: “Sys­tem re­li­a­bil­ity is a top priority at Google and we are mak­ing con­tin­u­ous im­prove­ments to make our sys­tems bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>Google did not re­spond to ST’s queries on the cause of the out­age.</p>
    <p>Mr Urs Hol­zle, se­nior vice-pres­i­dent of tech­ni­cal in­fras­truc­ture at Google, said on Twit­ter yes­ter­day: “A pool of servers that route traf­fic to ap­pli­ca­tion back­ends crashed, and users on that par­tic­u­lar pool ex­pe­ri­enced the out­age... We’re very sorry... We’re work­ing on a post­mortem to en­sure this won’t hap­pen again.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a live out­age map by third-party Web mon­i­tor­ing firm Down­de­tec­tor, the out­age af­fected mostly users across South­east Asia, In­dia, Ja­pan, Aus­tralia, and the United States. In Sin­ga­pore, it recorded over 1,200 re­ports of prob­lems with Gmail – the ma­jor­ity re­ported is­sues with log­ging in and re­ceiv­ing mes­sages.</p>
    <p>Mr Loo Wee Teck, global head of con­sumer elec­tron­ics at mar­ket re­search firm Euromon­i­tor In­ter­na­tional, said: “While out­ages are un­avoid­able, the is­sues seemed to be oc­cur­ring too fre­quently for Google, which is bad for their rep­u­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>“Free users do not have other al­ter­na­tives and will have to put up with the out­ages, (but) com­pa­nies will be look­ing to di­ver­sify and hedge its cloud-based ser­vices, open­ing up op­por­tu­ni­ties for com­peti­tors like Mi­crosoft and Zoom.”</p>
