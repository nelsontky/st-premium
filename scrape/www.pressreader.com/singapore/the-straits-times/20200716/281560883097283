    <p>Sem­b­corp Ma­rine (Sem­bMarine) posted a net loss of $192.1 mil­lion in the half-year ended June 30, ow­ing to the shut­down of pro­duc­tion ac­tiv­i­ties at all its Sin­ga­pore yards since April as a re­sult of the pan­demic. Staff will have their salaries cut by dif­fer­ing ex­tents, ex­cept for those earn­ing un­der $1,800 a month.</p>
    <p>Sem­b­corp Ma­rine (Sem­bmarine) has posted a net loss of $192.1 mil­lion in the half-year ended June 30, due to the shut­down of pro­duc­tion ac­tiv­i­ties at all its Sin­ga­pore yards since April as a re­sult of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>By com­par­i­son, the group recorded a net loss of $6.8 mil­lion in the same pe­riod the year be­fore.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue in the first half was $906 mil­lion, down 41 per cent from the same pe­riod a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>All seg­ments posted losses in the six-month pe­riod, with the ex­cep­tion of the re­pairs and up­grades busi­ness, which re­ported higher prof­its on bet­ter prod­uct mix of high­er­mar­gin up­grade projects ex­e­cuted in the first quar­ter of this year.</p>
    <p>Sem­bmarine pres­i­dent and chief ex­ec­u­tive Wong Weng Sun said yes­ter­day: “We had po­si­tioned our­selves for re­cov­ery in 2020, but we were un­ex­pect­edly hit by Covid-19 and the col­lapse of oil prices.</p>
    <p>“Given the de­lays in ex­e­cut­ing our ex­ist­ing projects, and with new or­ders likely to re­main de­pressed in 2020, the group now fore­sees that re­cov­ery will be pushed out to 2021 and be­yond.”</p>
    <p>The net or­der book was $1.91 bil­lion at end-June, down from $2.4 bil­lion at end-2019. “While we have yet to an­nounce sig­nif­i­cant new or­ders this year, we have re­sumed dis­cus­sions on sev­eral pro­ject op­por­tu­ni­ties,” Mr Wong said.</p>
    <p>With the eas­ing of Covid-19 mea­sures last month, pro­duc­tion ac­tiv­i­ties grad­u­ally re­sumed from early this month, but Sem­bmarine con­tin­ues to right-size its work­force.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong has vol­un­teered to take a 50 per cent pay cut. Se­nior man­age­ment will take a 15 per cent salary re­duc­tion; mid­dle man­age­ment will take 10 per cent less.</p>
    <p>All other em­ploy­ees in Sin­ga­pore and over­seas will take a 5 per cent pay cut, ex­cept for those earn­ing un­der $1,800 a month. Sem­bmarine’s board is also con­tin­u­ing with a 10 per cent re­duc­tion in di­rec­tor’s fees this year, sim­i­lar to FY2019.</p>
    <p>All non-es­sen­tial cap­i­tal ex­pen­di­tures have been de­ferred. Capex in the first half of this year was $58 mil­lion, less than a third of the amount in­curred in the first half of last year.</p>
    <p>Sem­bmarine re­mained in a net cur­rent li­a­bil­i­ties po­si­tion of $259 mil­lion as of June 30, due mainly to term loans ma­tur­ing over the next 12 months.</p>
    <p>With no op­er­at­ing ac­tiv­i­ties for al­most three months in the first half of this year, cash flow from op­er­a­tions was a neg­a­tive $122 mil­lion, against a pos­i­tive $273 mil­lion in the cor­re­spond­ing pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Net gear­ing was 1.35 times as of end-June, com­pared with 1.14 times at end-2019. First-half loss per share was 9.19 cents, widen­ing from a loss per share of 0.33 cent in the first half of last year.</p>
    <p>Net as­set value per share was 94.77 cents as of June 30 this year, down from 103.96 cents as of Dec 31 last year.</p>
