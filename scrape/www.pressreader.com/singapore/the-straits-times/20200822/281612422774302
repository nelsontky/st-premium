    <p>The uni­lat­eral re­open­ing of bor­ders to Brunei and New Zealand is a “small, cau­tious” step that can re­sus­ci­tate Changi Air­port.</p>
    <p>It is also an in­vi­ta­tion to the world, say­ing that Sin­ga­pore is open for busi­ness, said Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“The avi­a­tion sec­tor, Changi Air­port and Sin­ga­pore Air­lines do not just con­cern the sec­tor it­self, but are linked to the whole econ­omy,” he said in an in­ter­view with re­porters at the PSA Build­ing.</p>
    <p>“So we need to re­ally start to take steps to open up in a safe man­ner that can re­vive Changi Air­port and re­sus­ci­tate the avi­a­tion sec­tor.”</p>
    <p>The multi-min­istry task force bat­tling the Covid-19 out­break is re­lax­ing Sin­ga­pore’s bor­der con­trols, so that visi­tors from Brunei or New Zealand who have re­mained in the coun­try in the last con­sec­u­tive 14 days prior to their visit to Sin­ga­pore will not have to serve a stay-home no­tice when they ar­rive.</p>
    <p>How­ever, they will need to take a Covid-19 test upon their ar­rival at the air­port, and will be al­lowed to go about their ac­tiv­i­ties in Sin­ga­pore only af­ter re­ceiv­ing a neg­a­tive test re­sult.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said both coun­tries have been able to con­trol the Covid-19 out­break, with in­fec­tion rates well be­low 0.1 in­fec­tion per 100,000 peo­ple in their pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>He also said the number of trav­ellers com­ing from both coun­tries would be man­age­able.</p>
    <p>There are only two flights weekly that can fly a to­tal of 500 pas­sen­gers from Brunei to Sin­ga­pore, said Mr Ong.</p>
    <p>For New Zealand, there are four flights weekly that can fly a to­tal of about 1,200 pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said the coun­tries’ low in­fec­tion rates, com­bined with the testing upon ar­rival, means “a very, very low risk that we can man­age”.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve we can strike a good bal­ance be­tween keep­ing Sin­ga­pore and trav­ellers here safe, as well as reviving the air traf­fic sec­tor.”</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Trans­port will an­nounce op­er­a­tional de­tails re­gard­ing the ar­range­ment next week.</p>
    <p>Visi­tors from Brunei and New Zealand who want to en­ter Sin­ga­pore will have to ap­ply for an Air Travel Pass be­tween seven and 30 days be­fore the in­tended date of ar­rival.</p>
    <p>On this, Mr Ong said: “It gives us the flex­i­bil­ity that should there be an un­for­tu­nate turn of events, which I don’t think there will be... we can quickly re­act. And so that is re­ally the pur­pose of the Air Travel Pass.”</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter first floated the idea of uni­lat­er­ally open­ing up Sin­ga­pore’s bor­ders to coun­tries where the virus has been brought un­der con­trol in an ad­dress to Trans­port Min­istry staff ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>He said then that Covid-19 has set Changi Air­port back “by at least 40 years”. Sin­ga­pore’s chal­lenge, he said, is to re­store pas­sen­ger vol­ume while keep­ing virus trans­mis­sion un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>In ex­plain­ing why Sin­ga­pore has taken the ini­tia­tive to uni­lat­er­ally ease re­stric­tions on trav­ellers com­ing in from Brunei and New Zealand, be­fore re­cip­ro­cal ar­range­ments are made, Mr Ong said open­ness has been a hall­mark of Sin­ga­pore’s his­tory.</p>
    <p>He cited how Sin­ga­pore uni­lat­er­ally be­came a free port 200 years ago, and also uni­lat­er­ally opened up its skies in the 1980s when it built Ter­mi­nal 1.</p>
    <p>He added that the uni­lat­eral lift­ing of re­stric­tions on travel does not pre­clude the Re­pub­lic from ne­go­ti­at­ing re­cip­ro­cal agree­ments with like-minded part­ners or go­ing a step fur­ther in up­grad­ing such agree­ments.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to a ques­tion about broader travel agree­ments with China, with which Sin­ga­pore has a re­cip­ro­cal green lane ar­range­ment for es­sen­tial and busi­ness travel, Mr Ong said in Man­darin that Sin­ga­pore hopes to es­tab­lish a safe travel bub­ble if both coun­tries can reach a com­mon un­der­stand­ing.</p>
    <p>On a sim­i­lar ques­tion about Ja­pan, he said Sin­ga­pore will con­sider the pos­si­bil­ity of ne­go­ti­at­ing an air traf­fic cor­ri­dor if there is an op­por­tu­nity. He noted that Sin­ga­pore and Ja­pan al­ready have plans to dis­cuss a re­cip­ro­cal green lane ar­range­ment for es­sen­tial busi­ness travel.</p>
    <p>Asked which other coun­tries Sin­ga­pore could open its bor­ders to, through ei­ther uni­lat­eral or bi­lat­eral agree­ments, Mr Ong said the Trans­port Min­istry is work­ing with the Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs and Min­istry of Health to mon­i­tor the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion world­wide.</p>
    <p>“I think a rea­son­able start­ing point is to look at those coun­tries where the stay-home no­tice has been re­duced to seven days, and to see whether there are pos­si­bil­i­ties to progress,” he said.</p>
    <p>These coun­tries in­clude China, Viet­nam and Malaysia.</p>
    <p>The key to en­cour­ag­ing travel again was to safely re­move the quar­an­tine re­quire­ments, Mr Ong added.</p>
    <p>“I think the air­line in­dus­try is quite clear – when you have a stay­home no­tice re­quire­ment, you do dis­cour­age travel quite a bit,” he said. “So we have to try to have like­minded part­ners, sim­i­lar risk pro­files, sim­i­larly suc­cess­ful in con­trol­ling the virus, to open up a bub­ble, open up a chan­nel, and use tests to re­place stay-home no­tices.”</p>
    <p>The Changi air hub – which in­cludes air­lines, the air­port and ground-han­dling firms – has been con­tribut­ing more than 5 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct and em­ploy­ing 192,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts have noted that the re­cov­ery for Sin­ga­pore’s avi­a­tion sec­tor will be more dif­fi­cult, given the lack of a do­mes­tic mar­ket here.</p>
    <p>Last month, Changi Air­port had just 86,000 pas­sen­gers pass­ing through. This was a 98.5 per cent drop com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
