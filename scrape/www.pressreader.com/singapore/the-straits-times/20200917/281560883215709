    <p>The global eco­nomic slump will not be as sharp as pre­vi­ously feared this year, though the re­cov­ery is los­ing pace and will need sup­port from gov­ern­ments and cen­tral banks for some time yet, ac­cord­ing to the Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and Devel­op­ment (OECD). The world econ­omy will shrink by 4.5 per cent this year, less than the 6 per cent fore­cast in June, it said.</p>
    <p>• The global eco­nomic slump will not be as sharp as pre­vi­ously feared this year, though the re­cov­ery is los­ing pace and will need sup­port from gov­ern­ments and cen­tral banks for some time yet, ac­cord­ing to the Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co-op­er­a­tion and Devel­op­ment (OECD).</p>
    <p>The world econ­omy will shrink 4.5 per cent this year, less than the 6 per cent fore­cast in June, the Paris-based in­sti­tu­tion said yes­ter­day, up­grad­ing its out­look in re­sponse to re­bounds in ac­tiv­ity since lock­downs ended. There were big re­vi­sions for the United States and the euro area, as well as China, which is now fore­cast to grow mod­estly, the only Group of 20 coun­try with such a prospect.</p>
    <p>The bet­ter view re­flects the strong eco­nomic pickup in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>The US unem­ploy­ment rate fell more than fore­cast last month, while China this week re­ported pos­i­tive re­tail and in­dus­trial pro­duc­tion data. While that ini­tially strong pickup means the 2020 num­ber looks a lit­tle less grim, the pace of the re­cov­ery is now fad­ing, and out­put in many coun­tries will still be below its pre-cri­sis level at the end of 2021. There is also a risk of long-last­ing dam­age to economies, as well as bank­rupt­cies and job losses.</p>
    <p>Amid such dan­gers, the OECD said gov­ern­ments and cen­tral banks must con­tinue to pro­vide sup­port into 2021, after huge ef­forts this year that have bloated bal­ance sheets and stretched fis­cal bud­gets.</p>
    <p>But it added that as­sis­tance pro­grammes must evolve as growth picks up, al­low­ing money to be bet­ter tar­geted at pro­tect­ing busi­nesses and jobs in sec­tors with a vi­able fu­ture. That echoes com­ments from the Bank for In­ter­na­tional Set­tle­ments on Mon­day, which said the chal­lenge is to sup­port com­pa­nies with­out cre­at­ing “zom­bie” firms that dam­age economies in the longer term.</p>
    <p>While the OECD up­graded the global out­look, it also made huge down­ward re­vi­sions to a num­ber of emerg­ing mar­kets. In­dia’s econ­omy will shrink 10.2 per cent this year, al­most three times the pre­vi­ous fore­cast, while Ar­gentina, Mex­ico and South Africa will also suf­fer more than pre­dicted in June.</p>
    <p>The OECD said there is still huge un­cer­tainty about the out­look, and its lat­est pro­jec­tions as­sume con­tin­ued spo­radic virus out­breaks along with tar­geted lo­cal in­ter­ven­tions. The new fore­casts com­pare with its “sin­gle shock” sce­nario in June, which was based on no sec­ond wave of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The world econ­omy will shrink 4.5 per cent this year, less than the 6 per cent fore­cast in June, the OECD said, up­grad­ing its out­look in re­sponse to re­bounds in ac­tiv­ity since lock­downs ended.</p>
