    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>You should find that your en­ergy is just right for jump­ing into new fields and shak­ing up your col­leagues’ old pre­con­cep­tions.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>You have some deep-seated mis­trust of the new ideas or changes com­ing out of the day’s meet­ings, but this time, you are right.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Your mind is more flex­i­ble than most and the day brings an op­por­tu­nity to show off a lit­tle as you ab­sorb new facts and con­cepts quickly and eas­ily.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Some­one needs con­vinc­ing – you may need to push him or her a lit­tle bit, but you are far bet­ter off go­ing for rea­soned ar­gu­ments than im­pas­sioned pleas.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>You are not at the top of your game – but you still have it. Watch the sit­u­a­tion evolve and try to adapt to meet its chang­ing needs.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>You need more facts, so look for in­for­ma­tion that can help you.</p>
    <p>It is a good time to play sci­en­tist and ex­per­i­ment on your sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>You feel bet­ter about that one fam­ily mem­ber who has been act­ing strange be­cause you now un­der­stand him or her bet­ter.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>It is im­por­tant to col­lab­o­rate with oth­ers, if only to get their votes on the big changes you want to make. That may mean you have to ne­go­ti­ate.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>Reach out – that great so­cial en­ergy is still with you. It is eas­ier than ever to get peo­ple to like you or at least no­tice you.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>Your abil­ity to think about money with­out hy­per­ven­ti­lat­ing is ad­mirable, but it may be tested. That could be due to a debt.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Your bril­liance is on dis­play – a friend may com­ment on an idea you had or your boss may drag you into an­other meet­ing to show off your tal­ent.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>You are fac­ing the fu­ture in a new way and should find that your en­ergy is just right for ex­plor­ing new idea or plans. Think about what you want next.</p>
