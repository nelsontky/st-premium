    <p>The tides are bring­ing trash to Sin­ga­pore’s south­ern coast­lines.</p>
    <p>At East Coast Park, vis­i­tors may have no­ticed a hotch­potch of plas­tic items, such as cups and bot­tles, and sty­ro­foam con­tain­ers strewn on the beaches.</p>
    <p>And those who think the trash sit­u­a­tion looks worse than usual would not be wrong.</p>
    <p>The cause? Not so much the beach­go­ers, but the way the winds blow dur­ing the south-west mon­soon sea­son, which Sin­ga­pore is cur­rently ex­pe­ri­enc­ing.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) said there has been an al­most 90 per cent in­crease in the amount of flot­sam col­lected from the beaches at East Coast Park dur­ing this pe­riod, com­pared with other times of the year.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Parks Board (NParks) and NEA said that while there have been more vis­i­tors to the park in the sec­ond phase of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing, most vis­i­tors con­tinue to prac­tise good park eti­quette, in­clud­ing throw­ing their lit­ter into des­ig­nated bins.</p>
    <p>“The wind blows from the south or south-east be­tween June and Septem­ber, bring­ing an in­creased amount of flot­sam from the im­me­di­ate re­gion, which ac­cu­mu­lates on the shores of neigh­bour­ing coun­tries and is­lands, in­clud­ing East Coast Park,” said the agen­cies in a joint state­ment.</p>
    <p>A Straits Times check at one of the beaches at the park last Fri­day showed de­bris bear­ing the names of In­done­sian brands, such as Pop Mie in­stant noo­dles and Ale-Ale­brand drinks.</p>
    <p>The NEA said it has in­creased the fre­quency of clean­ing op­er­a­tions dur­ing this pe­riod, from four times a week to twice daily.</p>
    <p>“De­spite these in­ten­si­fied clean­ing ef­forts, it is not pos­si­ble to elim­i­nate the pres­ence of flot­sam on our beaches al­to­gether, as dur­ing each high tide, new waves of flot­sam from the open sea will be washed onto our shores,” said the state­ment.</p>
    <p>The sight of the trash-strewn beaches dur­ing her jogs so irked lo­cal marine en­thu­si­ast Sa­man­tha Thian, 25, that she de­cided to take mat­ters into her own hands.</p>
    <p>Early last month, she started a move­ment call­ing for vol­un­teers to help pick up trash on the beaches at East Coast Park.</p>
    <p>The cleanup ses­sions are ini­ti­ated by in­di­vid­u­als over the “Best East</p>
    <p>Coast Clean-up Plan” group on mes­sag­ing ap­pli­ca­tion Tele­gram. The group had more than 500 mem­bers as of last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Ms Thian, founder of so­cial en­ter­prise Seas­t­ain­able, which sells items such as metal straws and re­us­able cups to en­cour­age peo­ple to use less dis­pos­ables, said she hopes that the beach cleanup ini­tia­tive will raise aware­ness about the harm of sin­gle-use items.</p>
    <p>She added that while it may be the winds and cur­rents that bring trash onto Sin­ga­pore’s shores, the amount of plas­tic de­bris that washes up high­lights the broader prob­lem of the world’s reliance on these sin­gle-use items and the im­pact it could have on the oceans and marine life.</p>
    <p>“The bod­ies of fish or mam­mals are un­able to break down plas­tic, caus­ing plas­tic to re­main in their stom­achs, which even­tu­ally causes them to starve,” she said.</p>
    <p>The NEA said it col­lected more than 1,000 tonnes of flot­sam from the beaches at East Coast Park last year.</p>
    <p>Ms Thian also pointed to signs of the coro­n­avirus out­break in the trash: Vol­un­teers have found de­bris fur­ther inland near walk­ing paths, in­clud­ing med­i­cal equip­ment such as sur­gi­cal masks, gloves and even a box of sy­ringes, she said.</p>
    <p>NParks and NEA urged vis­i­tors to be con­sid­er­ate of oth­ers when en­joy­ing the park’s fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“Our parks, gar­dens and na­ture ar­eas are for all to en­joy. Keep­ing our parks clean is ev­ery­one’s re­spon­si­bil­ity. Lit­ter­ing not only spoils the beauty of our parks, but may harm wildlife too,” said the agen­cies.</p>
