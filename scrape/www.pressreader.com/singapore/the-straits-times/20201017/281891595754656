    <p>To me, a Ger­man, the United States of Amer­ica has al­ways been more than just a su­per­power that one had no choice but to live with.</p>
    <p>The US was more than the force oc­cu­py­ing Ger­many af­ter the war. And much more than the pro­tect­ing part­ner dur­ing the Cold War.</p>
    <p>The US was a shin­ing light, an in­spi­ra­tion – and at times, also quite an an­noy­ance. But what­ever it was, it never left me dis­in­ter­ested in what hap­pened across the</p>
    <p>At­lantic. The US was my yard­stick, of the good and the bad.</p>
    <p>I lis­tened to the ra­dio of the Amer­i­can armed forces, be­cause back in the 1970s West Ger­man ra­dio was so lame.</p>
    <p>Such was Amer­ica’s almighty geopo­lit­i­cal pres­ence that I was glued to the TV when the last Amer­i­can sol­diers, mo­men­tously for the re­gion, left Saigon in 1975.</p>
    <p>And in the 1980s I wanted to study in the US to even­tu­ally breathe the air of the New World. For the fresh­ness of it com­pared with old man Europe, and the pos­si­bil­ity of right­ing in­jus­tices, of the world be­com­ing a fairer place.</p>
    <p>In­deed, there was not much that could rock my be­lief in the ul­ti­mate good the US would bring. Amer­ica had a built-in mech­a­nism of au­to­cor­rect, I was con­vinced. And didn’t his­tory prove me right?</p>
    <p>Mr Robert F. Kennedy and Mr Lyn­don B. John­son in­tro­duced the Vot­ing Rights Act, do­ing away with the bla­tant in­jus­tice against black Amer­i­cans. The war in Viet­nam was brought to an end by peo­ple power. Mr Richard Nixon had to re­sign over an out­ra­geous cover-up that was un­masked by two brave in­ves­tiga­tive jour­nal­ists. And in 2008, the US even took the badge of courage fur­ther and elected a black politi­cian, Mr Barack Obama, to the high­est of­fice. This coun­try seemed to be able to al­ways put right its past de­fi­cien­cies.</p>
    <p>But cracks had be­gun to ap­pear. Slight cracks first, but hard to over­look.</p>
    <p>In the 1990s, par­ti­san pol­i­tics took root. Mr Newt Gin­grich, Repub­li­can Speaker in the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives, was not only overly com­bat­ive, ob­struc­tive and poi­sonous. He fought Mr Bill Clin­ton with an ag­gres­sive­ness that was as if the pres­i­dent was the in­car­na­tion of evil.</p>
    <p>Brush­ing aside ci­vil­ity, Mr Gin­grich paved the way for a cir­cle of neo­con ide­o­logues who were pulling the strings dur­ing the pres­i­dency of Mr Ge­orge W. Bush. This was fol­lowed by the con­fronta­tional Tea Party move­ment dur­ing the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion, and even­tu­ally led to Mr Don­ald Trump, who is the em­bod­i­ment of par­ti­san pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>POL­I­TICS OF DIVI­SION</p>
    <p>The term “work­ing across the aisle” now seems like a dis­tant mem­ory – the times when politi­cians ditched party ide­ol­ogy to come to bi­par­ti­san un­der­stand­ings are prac­ti­cally over. In Wash­ing­ton, draw­ing di­vid­ing lines and fir­ing up the base have be­come the top po­lit­i­cal pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>This is ex­actly what the pop­ulist text­book rec­om­mends: To first di­vide so­ci­ety into “Us” and “Them”, and then to at­tack in­sti­tu­tions such as the me­dia and the ju­di­ciary. The re­sult can be seen in to­day’s US: The coun­try suf­fers from an un­prece­dented ero­sion of trust.</p>
    <p>The ero­sion runs so deep that even the ques­tion of wear­ing masks against the pan­demic is a topic of po­lit­i­cal de­bate – as if only Democrats wear masks and Repub­li­cans don’t.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple are se­ri­ously ar­gu­ing over con­spir­acy the­o­ries – for ex­am­ple, whether lib­er­als are build­ing a “deep state”, a state within the state, that is un­der­min­ing the elected gov­ern­ment. In the past when such bizarre ideas sur­faced, they were laughed away. To­day, th­ese the­o­ries have made it into the up­per ech­e­lons of pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>Why? Be­cause facts are not facts any more. Every­thing is sub­ject to in­ter­pre­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>There is no Wal­ter Cronkite, the news an­chor who for 19 years pre­sented the evening news on CBS and who ex­em­pli­fied cred­i­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>To­day, TV, talk ra­dio and the In­ter­net are dom­i­nated by a ca­coph­ony of voices that preach to their re­spec­tive fol­low­ers – with Mr Trump be­ing just one of them. Truth is not any more what is, but what you be­lieve in.</p>
    <p>Can the clock be turned back? Is there a way out of this down­ward spi­ral?</p>
    <p>Even if Mr Joe Bi­den gets elected on Nov 3, the legacy he will in­herit is dev­as­tat­ing. Although some of the fate­ful de­ci­sions of the past four years can be cor­rected – whether it is on cli­mate, Nato, trade or dis­ar­ma­ment – the un­der­ly­ing so­ci­etal dis­trust will not go away.</p>
    <p>Why? Be­cause if Mr Bi­den be­comes pres­i­dent, this hap­pens mainly thanks to the poor han­dling of the pan­demic by Mr Trump, not be­cause peo­ple have turned away from the toxic pol­i­tics of the past.</p>
    <p>The coun­try is spoilt. This is the sober­ing re­al­ity.</p>
    <p>And yes, my faith in the self-heal­ing pow­ers of the US is deeply shaken. For the time be­ing, Amer­i­cans will con­tinue to fight and to bat­tle. The US will be busy deal­ing with it­self. In other words: We’d prob­a­bly bet­ter pre­pare for a post-Amer­i­can world.</p>
