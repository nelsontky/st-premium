    <p>As Amer­ica’s elec­tion cam­paign ap­proaches the Sept 7 Labour Day landmark, events of the past week have thrown into sharp re­lief the pow­er­ful ef­fect of fear, and the fragility of so­ci­eties with un­der­ly­ing racial and eco­nomic ten­sions.</p>
    <p>First, how­ever, Democrats got a dose of re­al­ity when a post-Repub­li­can Na­tional Con­ven­tion poll last Friday by data in­tel­li­gence com­pany Morn­ing Con­sult showed that United States Pres­i­dent Donald Trump has nar­rowed the gap with his ri­val Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>Former vice-pres­i­dent Bi­den led Mr Trump 50 per cent to 44 per cent among likely vot­ers, the poll showed. The lead was 52 per cent to 42 per cent be­fore the con­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has cut into Mr Bi­den’s lead among sub­ur­ban­ites and grown his sup­port among white vot­ers, though he wors­ened his stand­ing with vot­ers of colour, Morn­ing Con­sult re­ported.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the melt­down in Kenosha, a town of barely more than 100,000 in Wis­con­sin, has shown what hap­pens when a so­ci­ety with un­der­ly­ing race and eco­nomic fis­sures erupts at a deeply di­vi­sive time.</p>
    <p>Within two days, Kenosha went from a rel­a­tively sta­ble, nor­mal town to see­ing burn­ing and loot­ing af­ter the po­lice on Aug 23 shot a black man seven times in the back at close range. The shoot­ing hap­pened as he was reach­ing into his car fol­low­ing an al­ter­ca­tion and a scuf­fle.</p>
    <p>De­tails con­tinue to be murky, but 29-year-old Ja­cob Blake ap­par­ently did not have a gun; at most, he had a knife, re­ports say. He is in hos­pi­tal and paral­ysed from the waist down.</p>
    <p>Last Tues­day, white mili­ti­a­men armed with semi-au­to­matic weapons ap­peared in the town, ap­par­ently given a free pass by the po­lice. Among them was 17-year-old white teenager Kyle Rit­ten­house. All were in vi­o­la­tion of cur­few.</p>
    <p>Rit­ten­house has since been charged with homi­cide af­ter killing two peo­ple and wound­ing one that chaotic night. His lawyer is claim­ing self-de­fence.</p>
    <p>He may not have links to or­gan­ised, white mili­tia groups, but he is be­ing called a hero by many on the fur­ther-right reaches of the di­vide.</p>
    <p>Award-win­ning Chicago Sun-Times colum­nist Mary Mitchell wrote: “Do you re­ally think a young African Amer­i­can male could walk down the mid­dle of the street dur­ing a protest march car­ry­ing a semi-au­to­matic weapon, and po­lice wouldn’t stop him?”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump and his sur­ro­gates paint a pic­ture of a so­cial­ist hell await­ing Amer­ica if Mr Bi­den wins: com­fort­able sub­ur­bia – in­creas­ingly di­verse but still mostly white – will be in­vaded by low-in­come hous­ing; and il­le­gal im­mi­grants will be al­lowed to run loose, rap­ing and loot­ing.</p>
    <p>But both sides are play­ing up the fear fac­tor. The Demo­cratic Party says hell is al­ready here, and points to Kenosha as ev­i­dence. More is to come if Mr Trump wins re-elec­tion, they warn.</p>
    <p>The vi­o­lence in Kenosha was such that many res­i­dents ac­tu­ally left. Mr Andy Berg, Kenosha</p>
    <p>County board su­per­vi­sor, who lives in a di­verse dis­trict, was one of those who sent his family away for their own safety.</p>
    <p>There were no in­ci­dents last</p>
    <p>Friday, but “peo­ple are still scared”, he told The Straits Times on Saturday. “You’ve had groups of men come down with ri­fles and shot­guns and act like law en­force­ment when they’re not. Some of them were lo­cal folks.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to an ABC News/Wash­ing­ton Post poll ear­lier this month, 32 per cent of the coun­try said they thought they would be less safe from crime un­der a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion, com­pared with 25 per cent who thought they would be more safe.</p>
    <p>Kenosha “un­der­scores the mes­sage of fear that Trump is preach­ing – that if it can hap­pen in Kenosha, it can hap­pen in your rel­a­tively small city also, not just in New York or Los An­ge­les”, said po­lit­i­cal sci­ence pro­fes­sor Charles Bul­lock of the Univer­sity of Ge­or­gia.</p>
    <p>“And fear is a very strong mo­ti­va­tor. You’re wor­ried about your life, your kids, your busi­ness. It gets peo­ple’s at­ten­tion.”</p>
    <p>The pol­i­tics of fear, pick­ing at eth­nic or other di­vi­sions, is, of course, not exclusive to Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>But the late renowned po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Richard Hof­s­tadter fa­mously de­scribed a “para­noid style in Amer­i­can pol­i­tics” whose tar­gets have ranged from “in­ter­na­tional bankers” to mu­ni­tions mak­ers, and from Je­suits to Ma­sons to al­leged slave­hold­ers’ con­spir­a­cies.</p>
    <p>Hof­s­tadter wrote in 1964: “There is a style of mind that is far from new and that is not nec­es­sar­ily right-wing. I call it the para­noid style sim­ply be­cause no other word ad­e­quately evokes the sense of heated ex­ag­ger­a­tion, sus­pi­cious­ness and con­spir­a­to­rial fan­tasy.</p>
    <p>“The para­noid style is an old and re­cur­rent phe­nom­e­non in our pub­lic life which has been fre­quently linked with move­ments of sus­pi­cious dis­con­tent.”</p>
    <p>Labour Day is con­ven­tion­ally seen as the un­of­fi­cial start of the cam­paign. Mr Bi­den has said he will start cam­paign­ing af­ter that day.</p>
    <p>But Mr Trump, who in 2016 de­fied the odds to win the White House, has never re­ally stopped cam­paign­ing. That he out­raged crit­ics last Thurs­day by giv­ing his ac­cep­tance speech from the White House, is par for the course for him. He is not in­ter­ested in ad­her­ing to con­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>The 2020 elec­tion is head­ing into a street fight, in which there are no Queens­berry rules.</p>
