    <p>Q What were some of the chal­lenges you and Savour! faced at the start? A One of the big­gest chal­lenges was get­ting buy-in from the first mer­chant and cus­tomer.</p>
    <p>As a stu­dent en­tre­pre­neur with an idea, it was dif­fi­cult to con­vince es­tab­lished busi­nesses. I started by cold-call­ing po­ten­tial cus­tomers and mer­chants. I sent e-mails to 100 mer­chants seek­ing part­ner­ships, but only one replied.</p>
    <p>Many small and medium-sized en­ter­prises had not heard about sus­tain­abil­ity. We spent a long time try­ing to con­vince them of the ben­e­fits of re­duc­ing food waste via the plat­form to re­coup costs and clear in­ven­tory. I guess my per­sis­tence paid off and af­ter about a year, Savour! was of­fi­cially launched.</p>
    <p>Q So why not gather a group of vol­un­teers to do the job?</p>
    <p>A There are cur­rently many es­tab­lished and large food res­cue groups in Sin­ga­pore and I learnt that they have many in­ef­fi­cien­cies in the man­ual pro­cesses. These, I felt, could be made more ef­fec­tive with tech­nol­ogy, es­pe­cially since time is of the essence for ex­pir­ing, blem­ished and sur­plus food. Savour! al­lows our B2B cus­tomers easy ac­cess to the avail­able prod­ucts with just a few clicks.</p>
    <p>Q How far has Savour! come since it was just an idea in your mind?</p>
    <p>A To date, Savour! has over 1,000 plat­form list­ings and about 140 mer­chants and B2B cus­tomers. They in­clude restau­rant Grain, non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tions like the Sal­va­tion Army and stu­dent groups such as the NUS Stu­dents’ Com­mu­nity Ser­vice Club.</p>
    <p>We are also col­lab­o­rat­ing with the Na­tional Vol­un­teer and Phi­lan­thropy Cen­tre, Na­tional Coun­cil of So­cial Ser­vice and Na­tional Youth Coun­cil to raise aware­ness of Savour! among their mem­bers. Q What’s in the fu­ture for you and Savour!?</p>
    <p>A Savour! has ex­panded its of­fer­ings to in­clude reg­u­lar food, cor­po­rate gifts and of­fice sup­plies made from re­cy­clable and biodegrad­able prod­ucts. It is also rais­ing aware­ness of food waste and food in­se­cu­rity through ed­u­ca­tion, mar­ket­ing cam­paigns and we­bi­nars.</p>
