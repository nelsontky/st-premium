    <p>MEL­BOURNE • New South Wales Waratahs chair­man Roger Davis has fired a broad­side at New Zealand Rugby (NZR), ac­cus­ing the gov­ern­ing body of seek­ing to drive a wedge be­tween Aus­tralia’s pro­fes­sional sides and the coun­try’s na­tional rugby union.</p>
    <p>He told Aus­tralian me­dia that NZR had ap­proached Aus­tralia’s Su­per Rugby teams di­rectly to join its pro­posed 2021 com­pe­ti­tion while sidelin­ing Rugby Aus­tralia (RA).</p>
    <p>With the broader Su­per Rugby com­pe­ti­tion un­der a cloud due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, NZR has com­mit­ted to a tour­na­ment of eight to 10 teams, fea­tur­ing its five Su­per Rugby teams and a po­ten­tial side from the Pa­cific is­lands.</p>
    <p>RA is push­ing for its four Su­per Rugby teams and Perth-based West­ern Force to be in­volved in any fu­ture com­pe­ti­tion with New Zealand.</p>
    <p>“They’re try­ing to split us from Rugby Aus­tralia,” Davis said in com­ments pub­lished by the Syd­ney Morn­ing Her­ald late yesterday.</p>
    <p>“It’s ap­palling re­ally. We’re not go­ing to split or de­stroy the code by dump­ing two or three sides. It would do ir­repara­ble dam­age to the game here.”</p>
    <p>NZR and RA did not pro­vide im­me­di­ate com­ment on the re­port.</p>
    <p>NZR said last Fri­day it would work with RA to seek ex­pres­sions of in­ter­est from Aus­tralian clubs and other in­ter­ested par­ties to join the com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>Davis said Aus­tralia should flip the script and set up its own com­pe­ti­tion. “What’s good for the goose is good for the gan­der. NZR went straight to the clubs and by­passed Rugby Aus­tralia. We can do ex­actly the same,” he said.</p>
    <p>He also ques­tioned whether Aus­tralia or NZ could af­ford to snub each other.</p>
    <p>“You need 12 (teams) to make any money and they want to play against us,” Davis said.</p>
    <p>“We need New Zealand as much as New Zealand needs us... We’ve got 25 mil­lion peo­ple in our coun­try, they’ve got five. Eco­nom­ics runs this game and says they would part­ner with us.”</p>
