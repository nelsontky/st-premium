    <p>There were three new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>They in­cluded two per­ma­nent res­i­dents – a 61-year-old man and an 18-year-old woman – who re­turned from In­dia.</p>
    <p>The other is a short-term visit pass holder, a 30-year-old Amer­i­can woman who ar­rived from Italy. She is an en­gi­neer on a work project in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>All three were im­ported cases who were placed on stay-home no­tice on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH). They were asymp­to­matic and tested pos­i­tive while serv­ing their stay-home no­tice.</p>
    <p>The new cases take Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,119.</p>
    <p>This was the fifth day in a row where there were no new com­mu­nity cases and none from work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries. The num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with one case in the past week that is un­linked, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>MOH added that epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions are in progress.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, all the iden­ti­fied close con­tacts of the cases have been iso­lated and placed on quar­an­tine. They will be tested at the start and end of their quar­an­tine pe­riod so that asymp­to­matic cases can be de­tected.</p>
    <p>The min­istry will also con­duct sero­log­i­cal tests for the close con­tacts to de­ter­mine if the cases could have been in­fected by them.</p>
    <p>With 10 new cases dis­charged, 58,014 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 41 pa­tients re­main in hospi­tal, with none in the in­ten­sive care unit, while 21 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 28 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, the virus out­break that be­gan in De­cem­ber last year has in­fected more than 54 mil­lion peo­ple. More than 1.3 mil­lion peo­ple have died.</p>
