    <p>Sin­ga­pore may con­sider in­tro­duc­ing re­cip­ro­cal green lanes at Changi Air­port for tourists from coun­tries where the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion is sim­i­lar to or bet­ter than that in the Re­pub­lic. Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung sug­gested the ar­range­ment as a way to help boost Changi’s pas­sen­ger num­bers to about 40 per cent of pre-Covid lev­els.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore may con­sider in­tro­duc­ing re­cip­ro­cal green lanes at Changi Air­port for tourists from coun­tries where the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion is sim­i­lar to or bet­ter than that in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>This means leisure trav­ellers from such a coun­try will be ex­empted from hav­ing to serve a 14-day quar­an­tine on ar­rival here, and like­wise for Sin­ga­pore­ans visit­ing the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung sug­gested the ar­range­ment as a way to help boost Changi’s pas­sen­ger num­bers to about 40 per cent of pre-Covid-19 lev­els.</p>
    <p>“Serv­ing 14 days in iso­la­tion is a ma­jor de­ter­rent to trav­ellers, and we may have to con­sider re­plac­ing this with a rig­or­ous test­ing regime,” he said yes­ter­day in his maiden speech to the staff of his min­istry, which he was ap­pointed to last month in a Cab­i­net reshuf­fle.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong also said Sin­ga­pore could ex­plore let­ting tourists from coun­tries or re­gions which have kept the virus un­der con­trol to fly into Sin­ga­pore, even though they may bar Sin­ga­pore­ans from en­ter­ing.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, Sin­ga­pore has re­cip­ro­cal fast lane ar­range­ments at the air­port for visi­tors from China and Malaysia on busi­ness and of­fi­cial trips. For in­stance, those from China trav­el­ling to Sin­ga­pore must un­dergo a Covid-19 swab test 48 hours be­fore de­par­ture and after they land, among other con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar pacts are in the works with coun­tries like New Zealand.</p>
    <p>While these pos­si­bil­i­ties will help lift the air­port and avi­a­tion sec­tor out of its worst cri­sis in his­tory, Mr Ong also un­der­lined the need for the same en­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore had in its early days that led to the cre­ation of not just the air hub, but the sea port as well.</p>
    <p>In his ad­dress to mark National Day, Mr Ong painted, in broad strokes, the growth of Sin­ga­pore’s trans­port sec­tor, es­pe­cially its global con­nec­tions by sea and air, which can be at­trib­uted to the coun­try’s ge­o­graph­i­cal lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“But ge­o­graph­i­cal en­dow­ment is not enough be­cause the road we trav­elled since then is not made by</p>
    <p>BIG CHAL­LENGE</p>
    <p>As col­leagues from Changi Air­port told me, Covid-19 set us back by at least 40 years, to 1981, when Ter­mi­nal 1 first opened... Our chal­lenge is to re­store pas­sen­ger vol­ume, while keep­ing virus trans­mis­sion un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>The cir­cum­stances are dif­fer­ent, but we need the same hunger and en­ter­prise as we had in the early 1980s. ’’</p>
    <p>TRANS­PORT MIN­IS­TER ONG YE KUNG</p>
    <p>na­ture, but carved by hand.”</p>
    <p>Gen­er­a­tions of Sin­ga­pore­ans worked hard as they seized the mar­itime op­por­tu­ni­ties that, over the years, led to the rise of var­i­ous hubs, in­clud­ing in avi­a­tion, fi­nance and in­fo­com­mu­ni­ca­tions, he noted.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s port is the world’s No. 2 in terms of cargo vol­ume, a spot it has held for nearly 50 years. On land, “the MRT map to­day is as tight and as com­pre­hen­sive as many ad­vanced Euro­pean cities”, he said.</p>
    <p>And Changi Air­port is among the top, if not the top, in the world.</p>
    <p>Then Covid-19 struck and the dam­age to Changi has been crip­pling.</p>
    <p>It was the world’s sev­enth busiest air­port in terms of in­ter­na­tional pas­sen­ger traf­fic. Daily, it had more than 1,000 plane move­ments.</p>
    <p>To­day, it is in 50th po­si­tion, with just 150 plane move­ments.</p>
    <p>“The air­port has been al­most to­tally in­ca­pac­i­tated. Strict bor­der mea­sures and health con­cerns have de­flated in­ter­na­tional air travel to al­most zero,” Mr Ong said.</p>
    <p>Changi has be­gun to serve trans­fer and tran­sit pas­sen­gers, but it is a trickle, at 400 pas­sen­ger move­ments a day, or 150,000 a year, com­pared with the pre-Covid-19 vol­ume of close to 20 mil­lion a year.</p>
    <p>“As col­leagues from Changi Air­port told me, Covid-19 set us back by at least 40 years, to 1981, when Ter­mi­nal 1 first opened,” the min­is­ter said.</p>
    <p>It was a time when air­lines had not de­cided on fly­ing to Sin­ga­pore. “We went all out... to in­vite the car­ri­ers to Changi.</p>
    <p>“To­day, the air­lines are here, and Changi has grown into a world-class air­port,” he added.</p>
    <p>“Our chal­lenge is to re­store pas­sen­ger vol­ume, while keep­ing virus trans­mis­sion un­der con­trol. The cir­cum­stances are dif­fer­ent, but we need the same hunger and en­ter­prise as we had in the early 1980s.”</p>
    <p>As a new world or­der re­shapes Sin­ga­pore, Mr Ong turned to Changi Air­port again to make his point on the unyield­ing truths for the coun­try’s con­tin­u­ing sta­tus as an air and sea hub.</p>
    <p>He re­counted visit­ing Ter­mi­nal 2 re­cently and be­ing greeted by with­ered bougainvil­lea plants – a far cry from the lush blooms that line the en­trances to the de­par­ture hall. Why? he asked.</p>
    <p>The re­ply: Ter­mi­nal 2 is closed, and they had to save costs, in­clud­ing on plant main­te­nance. But bougainvil­lea plants are hardy, and they will live, he was told.</p>
    <p>He scratched a plant and un­der­neath its dried brown bark, he saw a bright green stem. “If the plant had a heart, it was still pump­ing strong,” said Mr Ong, in­spired to draw an anal­ogy. “When it comes to the fate of Sin­ga­pore, the fol­low­ing truth holds: To sur­vive, we have to keep our bor­ders open. To thrive, we have to con­nect to the world.</p>
    <p>“To pros­per, we have to be a hub of the global econ­omy.”</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has “in­ca­pac­i­tated one of our lungs, but the Sin­ga­pore heart – our de­ter­mi­na­tion, dy­namism and en­ter­prise – is still pump­ing strong”, he added.</p>
    <p>“Changi Air­port will one day be full again, SIA planes will once again soar. This is our col­lec­tive mis­sion in the com­ing months and years ahead, as we await the bloom­ing of the bougainvil­lea once again.”</p>
