    <p>Chance for US to change China pol­icy</p>
    <p>Ed­i­to­rial</p>
    <p>China Daily, China</p>
    <p>The US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion marks an op­por­tu­nity for the world’s two largest economies to re­boot their re­la­tions. It should not be squan­dered. The two coun­tries des­per­ately need to man­age their in­creas­ingly an­tag­o­nis­tic re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Given the broad com­mon in­ter­ests of the two coun­tries, not to men­tion their global re­spon­si­bil­i­ties, the two coun­tries have ev­ery rea­son to strengthen their co­or­di­na­tion and co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The phase one trade deal – the bumpy process that has led to it, the step-by-step phi­los­o­phy it em­bod­ies in re­solv­ing com­pli­cated is­sues and the two sides’ com­mit­ment to car­ry­ing it out – shows that their re­la­tions are not yet bro­ken be­yond re­pair.</p>
    <p>China-bash­ing might have fu­elled the elec­tion cam­paigns, but it will not help the US adapt to the pro­found changes trans­form­ing the world.</p>
    <p>The hard-lin­ers in Wash­ing­ton should re-ex­am­ine their strate­gies and poli­cies in the light of re­al­ity rather than ide­ol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Ted Gover</p>
    <p>The States­man, In­dia</p>
    <p>The Nov 3 US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion of­fers a choice be­tween two can­di­dates with markedly dif­fer­ent for­eign pol­icy plat­forms.</p>
    <p>A sec­ond term of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump would see a con­tin­u­a­tion of “Amer­ica First”, that is, Mr Trump’s na­tion­al­ist pol­icy of par­ing down Amer­i­can se­cu­rity com­mit­ments abroad, se­cur­ing new trade agree­ments and re-ex­am­in­ing Wash­ing­ton’s re­la­tion­ships with in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>It would likely in­volve a near-com­plete with­drawal of US troops from Afghanista­n, an at­tempt at a nu­clear arms agree­ment with Rus­sia, a re­newed drive for sum­mitry to ne­go­ti­ate North Korean de­nu­cle­ari­sa­tion, fur­ther squab­bles with Nato mem­bers over the al­liance’s fund­ing and ad­di­tional de­mands for Ja­pan and South Korea to in­crease spend­ing for host­ing Amer­i­can forces.</p>
    <p>On Covid-19, a Trump II ad­min­is­tra­tion would stay out of the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) and steer clear of its Covax project of de­vel­op­ing and dis­tribut­ing a coro­n­avirus vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Con­cern­ing China, a new</p>
    <p>Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion would strive to ne­go­ti­ate a phase two trade deal while main­tain­ing US tar­iffs on Chi­nese im­ports, sus­tain the global cam­paign of dis­cour­ag­ing coun­tries from us­ing Huawei 5G net­works and deepen re­la­tion­ships with Asian part­ners for pur­poses of chal­leng­ing Bei­jing’s claims in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar to Mr Trump, Mr Joe Bi­den is not in­clined for the US to re-as­sume its prior role as the world’s po­lice­man. To demon­strate its com­mit­ment to mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism, a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion would re­join bod­ies like the Paris Cli­mate Agree­ment, the WHO, the Covax ini­tia­tive and pos­si­bly the Iran nu­clear deal to ad­dress global prob­lems.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den would seek a less high-pro­file ap­proach to North Korea than Mr Trump, and he would work on re­pair­ing re­la­tions</p>
    <p>with Nato, Ja­pan, South Korea and other tra­di­tional al­lies.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Bi­den would make known his op­po­si­tion to China’s in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty theft, trade cheat­ing, crack­down in Hong Kong and hu­man rights abuses against its Mus­lim and Chris­tian pop­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Amid the in­creas­ingly volatile is­sue of tech­nol­ogy and China, Mr Bi­den would likely con­tinue Mr Trump’s pol­icy of be­ing tough on tech agree­ments and tech com­pe­ti­tion out of na­tional se­cu­rity con­cerns.</p>
    <p>With trade, a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion would con­sider join­ing the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship to gain ac­cess to new mar­kets, pro­vid­ing an op­por­tu­nity for the US to in­flu­ence the re­gion’s next gen­er­a­tion of trade pol­icy.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den would con­tinue se­lect arms sales to Tai­wan, work with re­gional Asian part­ners on se­cu­rity is­sues in the South China Sea and East China Sea, en­hance se­cu­rity re­la­tions with In­dia and at­tend Asean Sum­mits and</p>
    <p>Asia-Pa­cific Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion fo­rums from which Mr Trump has been ab­sent.</p>
