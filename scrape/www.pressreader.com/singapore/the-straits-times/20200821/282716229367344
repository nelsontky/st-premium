    <p>HAV­ING THEIR CAKE AND EAT­ING IT TOO: Two Hong Kong singers turned 48 this week – Leo Ku on Tues­day and Can­topop diva Sammi Cheng a day later, on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>To mark the oc­ca­sion, Cheng, who is mar­ried to fel­low singer Andy Hui, posted on so­cial me­dia a com­pos­ite im­age of four cakes she re­ceived for her birth­day. One of the cakes was dec­o­rated with the fig­ures of her pet dog Lucky and cat Mike (left). It was also topped with three pack­ets of potato chips and cheese sticks, her favourite tid­bits.</p>
    <p>Cheng, fa­mous for songs such as Beau­ti­ful Life and Worth It, thanked her friends for their love and bless­ings by shar­ing a photo of her­self with Lucky and Mike, and an­other one sur­rounded by bou­quets of flow­ers (above). She wrote in Chi­nese: “I did not plan any cel­e­bra­tions to­day. Just like this, I have en­tered the 48th year of my life, as we ‘grew this way’,” re­fer­ring to the name of the sin­gle she re­leased last year.</p>
    <p>She added that while the cakes were full of calo­ries, birth­days come around but once a year.</p>
    <p>The fit­ness buff up­dated her post later in the day, writ­ing: “Back to nor­mal to­mor­row. Say no to junk food (and tid­bits). Train harder at 48.”</p>
    <p>Her views echoed those of vet­eran singer Alan Tam, who was con­cerned about gain­ing weight ear­lier this week, after he re­ceived his first cake for his 70th birth­day on Sun­day. He went jog­ging the next day.</p>
