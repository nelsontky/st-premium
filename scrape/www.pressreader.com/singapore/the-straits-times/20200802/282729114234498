    <p>The suc­cess­ful launch of the Mars 2020 mis­sion from Cape Canaveral in Florida on Thurs­day put the Per­se­ver­ance rover and its In­ge­nu­ity he­li­copter fi­nally on the jour­ney to the red planet. Amer­ica’s Na­tional Aero­nau­tics and Space Ad­min­is­tra­tion (Nasa) should be pleased to have par­tic­i­pated in a his­toric mo­ment that be­longs to hu­mankind as a whole. Nasa ad­min­is­tra­tor Jim Bri­den­s­tine is quoted as hav­ing said that this was the first time in his­tory where a mis­sion’s goal is ex­plic­itly to find life on another world – an­cient life on Mars. Key to that quest is the Jezero Crater, the land­ing site of the Per­se­ver­ance rover, an SUV-size ve­hi­cle. According to Nasa, it chose the crater be­cause sci­en­tists be­lieve the area was once flooded with wa­ter and was home to an an­cient river delta. Jezero Crater re­calls the on-again, off-again na­ture of the wet past of Mars.</p>
    <p>More than 3.5 bil­lion years ago, Nasa says, river chan­nels spilled over the crater wall and cre­ated a lake. It is con­ceiv­able that mi­cro­bial life ex­isted in Jezero dur­ing one or more of the wet times. Signs of their re­mains might be found in lakebed or shore­line sed­i­ments. The re­sult of the mis­sion will not be clear soon be­cause the rover is sched­uled to land after trav­el­ling through space for about seven months. Yet, once those re­sults be­gin to ar­rive, hu­mans would be able to have a bet­ter sense of the pos­si­bil­ity of life on Mars.</p>
    <p>Space­craft from the United Arab Emi­rates and</p>
    <p>China have joined the race to the red planet as well. This is all for the good. As in war and sports, space mis­sions test the lim­its of hu­man in­ge­nu­ity, plan­ning and ex­e­cu­tion. They are a tri­umph for science no mat­ter who wins. How­ever, like sports and un­like war, which is in­ju­ri­ous, space mis­sions could be col­lab­o­ra­tive as well as be­ing com­pet­i­tive. If the aim is to make Mars hab­it­able one day, it should be a joint ef­fort with a less heavy em­pha­sis on the na­tion­al­ity of those in­volved.</p>
