    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Twenty-six Ro­hingya refugees feared to have drowned while try­ing to swim to the Malaysian re­sort is­land of Langkawi have been found hid­ing in the bushes on a nearby islet, ac­cord­ing to a se­nior coast­guard of­fi­cial yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Malaysia does not recog­nise refugee sta­tus, but the Mus­lim-ma­jor­ity coun­try is a favoured des­ti­na­tion for Ro­hingya Mus­lims seek­ing a bet­ter life af­ter es­cap­ing a 2017 mil­i­tary crack­down in Myan­mar and, more re­cently, refugee camps in Bangladesh.</p>
    <p>Late last Satur­day, one Ro­hingya swam ashore from a small boat off Langkawi’s west coast. Of­fi­cials feared that the rest of the group had drowned while try­ing to reach the beach, but they were later dis­cov­ered on an islet just off the coast.</p>
    <p>“They were found hid­ing in the bushes on the is­land,” Mr Mohd Zu­bil Mat Som, direc­tor-gen­eral of the Malaysian Mar­itime En­force­ment Agency (MMEA), said in a text mes­sage.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have de­tained the refugees. Two more Ro­hingya mi­grants have also been ar­rested for sus­pected traf­fick­ing in con­nec­tion with the peo­ple found.</p>
    <p>The refugees were be­lieved to have trans­ferred to a small boat to sneak into Malaysia, hav­ing trav­elled on a “mother boat” car­ry­ing hun­dreds of Ro­hingya from Bangladesh, the coast­guard of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>MMEA’s pro­vin­cial direc­tor</p>
    <p>Mohd Zawawi Ab­dul­lah said the refugees were smug­gled in on lo­cal fish­ing boats that acted as “trans­porters” to take them to Langkawi.</p>
    <p>“Our in­ves­ti­ga­tions found that this syndicate trans­fers mi­grants from mother boats near the mar­itime border to lo­cal fish­ing boats to evade lo­cal au­thor­i­ties,” he said.</p>
    <p>Last month, Malaysia de­tained 269 Ro­hingya who ar­rived in Langkawi on a dam­aged boat.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin said last month that Malaysia was un­able to take in any more Ro­hingya, cit­ing a strug­gling econ­omy bat­tered by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
