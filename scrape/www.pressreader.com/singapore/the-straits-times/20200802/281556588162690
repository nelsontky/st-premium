    <p>A 26-year-old Sin­ga­porean woman was one of 307 new Covid-19 cases de­tected in Sin­ga­pore as at noon yes­ter­day, said the Health Min­istry (MOH) in its daily up­date of coron­avirus in­fec­tions here.</p>
    <p>Five were im­ported cases who had been serv­ing their 14-day stay­home no­tice upon ar­riv­ing in Sin­ga­pore from the Philip­pines, In­dia and China.</p>
    <p>The five pa­tients are aged be­tween one and 62 years old.</p>
    <p>Of the five, only a 34-year-old female work pass holder from the Philip­pines had ex­pe­ri­enced the on­set of symp­toms. The rest were asymp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing cases were mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>The sole com­mu­nity case re­ported yes­ter­day had been de­tected un­der the en­hanced com­mu­nity test­ing done on all in­di­vid­u­als aged 13 and above who are di­ag­nosed with an acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion by a doc­tor, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>“This al­lows us to iden­tify in­fected i ndi­vid­u­als early and to quickly con­tain fur­ther spread,” it added.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has de­creased from an av­er­age of seven cases per day in the week before, to an av­er­age of three per day in the past week, said MOH.</p>
    <p>“The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also de­creased, from an av­er­age of four cases per day in the week before, to an av­er­age of one per day in the past week. We will con­tinue to closely mon­i­tor these num­bers, as well as the cases de­tected through our sur­veil­lance pro­gramme,” added the min­istry.</p>
    <p>MOH also said it has closed 36 Covid-19 dor­mi­tory clus­ters, which now house only re­cov­ered in­di­vid­u­als and those who have re­cently tested neg­a­tive for the coron­avirus in­fec­tion, fol­low­ing ex­ten­sive test­ing of mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries here.</p>
    <p>MOH also said that 249 more Covid-19 pa­tients have been dis­charged from hos­pi­tals or com­mu­nity iso­la­tion fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>This brings the total num­ber of pa­tients who have fully re­cov­ered from the in­fec­tion and have been dis­charged from hos­pi­tals or com­mu­nity care fa­cil­i­ties to 46,740.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Al-Sahira Restau­rant at 200 Jalan Sul­tan and the adi­das and KFC out­lets at Bugis Junc­tion were among places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were still in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>Other places added to the list in­clude Omakase Burger at Wisma Atria, Ikea Alexan­dra and the Giant supermarke­t at Sun­shine Place, lo­cated at 475 Choa Chu Kang Av­enue 3.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions and the times that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients have vis­ited them, to get those who were at these places dur­ing the spec­i­fied pe­ri­ods to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit. The full list of lo­ca­tions and times can be found on the min­istry’s web­site.</p>
