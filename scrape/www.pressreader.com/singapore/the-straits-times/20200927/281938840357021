    <p>BUENOS AIRES An Ar­gen­tine law­maker has re­signed af­ter be­ing caught on live cam­era ca­ress­ing his part­ner be­fore ap­pear­ing to par­tially pull down her top and kiss her breast dur­ing a vir­tual ses­sion of the coun­try’s Lower House of Congress on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The Cham­ber of Deputies said on Twit­ter early on Friday that it had voted to ac­cept the res­ig­na­tion of Mr Juan Ameri, a rep­re­sen­ta­tive from the north­ern prov­ince of Salta in the rul­ing coali­tion.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a spe­cial meet­ing of the coun­try’s deputies, with a few law­mak­ers in phys­i­cal at­ten­dance but most oth­ers ap­pear­ing via large screens in the cham­ber, Mr Ameri ap­peared on a screen sit­ting with his part­ner, be­fore per­form­ing the lewd act.</p>
    <p>Shortly af­ter the in­ci­dent, which went vi­ral and sparked out­rage in Argentina, law­mak­ers voted to sus­pend Mr Ameri while a panel was con­vened to de­cide his fi­nal sanc­tion. It later ac­cepted his res­ig­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Vir­tual meet­ings amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic have tripped up law­mak­ers be­fore.</p>
    <p>In June, Ir­ish politi­cian Luke Ming Flana­gan ap­peared to be wear­ing no trousers as he dis­cussed pol­icy mat­ters with his Euro­pean Par­lia­ment peers.</p>
    <p>Mr Ameri, in com­ments to lo­cal ra­dio, said that he felt bad about what had hap­pened, adding that his In­ter­net con­nec­tion had been poor and that he had been caught un­awares in an in­ti­mate mo­ment.</p>
    <p>The rul­ing Frente de To­dos coali­tion said the in­ci­dent had shown a lack of re­spect for the Ar­gen­tine peo­ple and the leg­is­la­ture, and had called for a strong sanc­tion.</p>
    <p>“As rep­re­sen­ta­tives of the peo­ple we can­not al­low ir­re­spon­si­bil­ity of this mag­ni­tude,” the party said be­fore Mr Ameri’s res­ig­na­tion was con­firmed.</p>
