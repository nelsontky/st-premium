    <p>• New Zealand Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern yes­ter­day said she will step down as leader of the cen­tre-left Labour Party if opin­ion polls prove wrong and she loses to­mor­row’s gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The prospect ap­pears re­mote, with Labour en­joy­ing a 15-per­cent­age-point lead in the polls, but Ms Ardern re­sponded with a firm “no” when asked dur­ing a tele­vised de­bate if she would be­come op­po­si­tion leader should the vote not go her way.</p>
    <p>The 40-year-old, who has led New Zealand through a string of crises in the past three years, cul­mi­nat­ing in the Covid-19 pan­demic, said her com­mit­ment to the job had de­manded sac­ri­fice.</p>
    <p>“I never take for granted that I’m here. I give my ev­ery­thing,” she said. “No mat­ter what cri­sis is thrown my way, you will al­ways be as­sured I will give my ev­ery­thing to this job, even if that means a huge sac­ri­fice.”</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern said even if she was not in Par­lia­ment, she would still be in­volved in pol­i­tics in some way, say­ing she wanted to ef­fect change and take de­bate be­yond mud­sling­ing in­sults. “I want our nation not to be com­pletely po­larised, and ac­tu­ally, rel­a­tive to other coun­tries, we do a pretty good job on that,” she said.</p>
    <p>A TVNZ poll yes­ter­day put Labour’s sup­port at 46 per cent, down 1 per­cent­age point on a month ago, but well ahead of the con­ser­va­tive Na­tional Party which also slipped 1 per­cent­age point, to 31 per cent.</p>
    <p>Un­der New Zealand’s pro­por­tional vot­ing sys­tem, Ms Ardern would still need mi­nor party sup­port to gov­ern, but coali­tion part­ner the Greens would eas­ily get her over the line. Ms Ardern’s pop­u­lar­ity as pre­ferred premier was up 5 per­cent­age points to 55 per cent, while Na­tional leader Ju­dith Collins fell 3 per­cent­age points to 20 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern has framed the bal­lot as “the Covid elec­tion” and her ap­peal rests largely on her suc­cess in com­bat­ing the virus, with just 25 deaths in New Zealand’s pop­u­la­tion of five mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Asked what mes­sage she had for un­de­cided vot­ers, she said New Zealan­ders needed stable gov­ern­ment and should “stick to­gether in un­cer­tain times” to work on a fast eco­nomic re­cov­ery. “Yes we have to man­age the Covid cri­sis... but we have to look to the fu­ture too and all those chal­lenges, en­vi­ron­men­tal sus­tain­abil­ity, train­ing and so on.”</p>
    <p>Ms Collins said her party was best placed to steer the econ­omy through a coro­n­avirus-in­duced re­ces­sion. “I bring real busi­ness ex­pe­ri­ence at a time of grave eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion that we’re mov­ing into now, and the abil­ity to make de­ci­sions,” she said.</p>
