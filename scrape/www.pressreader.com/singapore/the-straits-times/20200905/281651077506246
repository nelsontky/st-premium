    <p>Pre­lim­i­nary data shows that 5,280 Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens were re­trenched be­tween Jan­uary and June this year, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo told Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to ques­tions by the Work­ers’ Party’s Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang GRC), Mrs Teo said that about 11,000 cit­i­zens were placed on un­paid leave com­pared with 33,000 non-cit­i­zens dur­ing the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Ms He also asked about Sin­ga­pore­ans who have had their pay cut by more than half since the start of cir­cuit breaker mea­sures.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Mrs Teo said em­ploy­ees who had their pay re­duced by more than half formed a “small mi­nor­ity” as of Aug 20.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers with more than 10 staff are re­quired to no­tify the Min­istry of Man­power within one week of im­ple­ment­ing cost-sav­ing mea­sures, such as shorter work hours or no-pay leave, that re­sult in a more than 25 per cent cut in gross monthly salary for lo­cal em­ploy­ees or ba­sic monthly salary for for­eign em­ploy­ees since April 6.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said: “We are not able to pro­vide the break­down be­tween Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens and per­ma­nent res­i­dents as the dis­tinc­tion was not made in the no­ti­fi­ca­tion by em­ploy­ers.”</p>
    <p>The Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party’s Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio GRC) asked about the num­ber of un­em­ployed work­ers who are above 50, and the av­er­age time it takes for them to be em­ployed again.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said the min­istry es­ti­mates there were 90,500 un­em­ployed res­i­dents – Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents – in June this year, an in­crease of 16,600 from De­cem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>She pointed out that the pro­por­tion of those un­em­ployed aged 50 and over has been sta­ble, at one in three work­ers. About one in four per­sons in the res­i­dent work­force is aged 50 and over, she added.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said: “Based on the lat­est avail­able data on the du­ra­tion of un­em­ploy­ment, the me­dian pe­riod for res­i­dents aged 50 and over was 12 weeks. This had been broadly sta­ble for a num­ber of years.”</p>
    <p>But Mrs Teo ex­pects the du­ra­tion “to rise in times of eco­nomic down­turns, al­though the ex­tent re­mains to be seen”.</p>
    <p>So far, more than 95,000 po­si­tions – job, trainee­ship and at­tach­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties – have been</p>

    <p>They com­prise 65,000 job op­por­tu­ni­ties, close to 20,000 com­pa­ny­hosted trainee­ships, at­tach­ments or train­ing places, and more than 10,000 op­por­tu­ni­ties un­der the SGUnited skills pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The min­istry has helped to place over 25,000 job seek­ers in jobs, trainee­ships and train­ing places.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo noted that 24,000 across var­i­ous age groups had been placed in new jobs. About half are in the pub­lic sec­tor, with about 25 per cent in the mod­ern ser­vices and life­style sec­tors.</p>
    <p>“The salary range of jobs can vary, de­pend­ing on the sec­tor and the spe­cific job role that an in­di­vid­ual takes up,” Mrs Teo said.</p>
