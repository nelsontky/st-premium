    <p>•</p>
    <p>Rus­sian op­po­si­tion politi­cian Alexei Navalny shared a pho­to­graph from a Ber­lin hos­pi­tal yes­ter­day, sit­ting up in bed and sur­rounded by his fam­ily, and said he could now breathe in­de­pen­dently after be­ing poi­soned in Siberia last month.</p>
    <p>The photo – the strong­est ev­i­dence yet of Mr Navalny’s ad­vanc­ing re­cov­ery after emerg­ing from a coma last week – was swiftly fol­lowed by con­fir­ma­tion from his press spokesman that he planned to re­turn to Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>“Hi, this is Navalny. I miss you all,” he wrote in the cap­tion to his In­sta­gram fol­low­ers. “I can still hardly do any­thing, but yes­ter­day I could breathe all day on my own. Ac­tu­ally on my own.”</p>
    <p>The lead­ing op­po­nent of Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin fell ill while cam­paign­ing on Aug 20 and was air­lifted to Ber­lin.</p>
    <p>Ger­many says lab­o­ra­tory tests in three coun­tries have de­ter­mined he was poi­soned with a Novi­chok nerve agent, and Western gov­ern­ments have de­manded an ex­pla­na­tion from Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>Moscow has called the ac­cu­sa­tions ground­less.</p>
    <p>Krem­lin spokesman Dmitry Peskov yes­ter­day re­it­er­ated that</p>
    <p>Moscow was open to clear­ing up what hap­pened to Mr Navalny, but needed ac­cess to in­for­ma­tion on his case from Ber­lin.</p>
    <p>He said Moscow did not un­der­stand why, if French and Swedish labs had been able to test his med­i­cal sam­ples, Rus­sia was not be­ing given the same ac­cess.</p>
    <p>The case has fur­ther strained re­la­tions be­tween Rus­sia and the West, al­ready at a post-Cold War low.</p>
    <p>The New York Times yes­ter­day quoted a Ger­man se­cu­rity of­fi­cial as say­ing Mr Navalny planned to re­turn to Rus­sia as soon as he re­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>Con­firm­ing the re­port, Mr Navalny’s spokesman Kira Yarmysh wrote on Twit­ter: “No other op­tions were ever con­sid­ered.”</p>
    <p>When asked for com­ment, Mr Peskov said: “Any cit­i­zen of the Rus­sian Fed­er­a­tion is free to leave Rus­sia and re­turn to Rus­sia. If a cit­i­zen of the Rus­sian Fed­er­a­tion re­cov­ers his health, then of course ev­ery­one will be happy about that.”</p>
    <p>Mr Navalny, 44, has riled Mr Putin for the past decade with de­tailed cam­paigns ex­pos­ing of­fi­cial cor­rup­tion, by­pass­ing the state­con­trolled me­dia by us­ing In­sta­gram and YouTube.</p>
