    <p>My son re­cently par­tic­i­pated in a Pri­mary 2 co-cur­ric­u­lar ac­tiv­ity (CCA) ex­po­sure pro­gramme or­gan­ised by his school.</p>
    <p>The week-long pro­gramme ex­posed pupils to the CCAs of­fered in school to help them choose one based on their in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the pro­gramme, my son was ex­cited to dis­cuss his CCA choices with me. But he felt sad for a class­mate who had been in­formed by a teacher that she could not join the foot­ball CCA as it was in­tended only for boys.</p>
    <p>I was deeply af­fected on learn­ing of this mat­ter. At the pri­mary school level, is it re­ally an is­sue if the girls train with the boys? It is not as if they are play­ing for any ma­jor league.</p>
    <p>My two older boys at­tend foot­ball train­ing ses­sions or­gan­ised by the Ac­tiveSG Foot­ball Academy where fe­male par­tic­i­pants train with the male par­tic­i­pants. Play well, and they get high fives all around. Do poorly, and they all get chided by the coach. No one makes a big deal out of it.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tion­ally, with more mixed-gen­der events in var­i­ous sports ap­proved for the up­com­ing Olympics in Tokyo, per­haps it is time for us to start rewrit­ing the rules and chal­lenge the sta­tus quo that we have grown so com­fort­able with in our schools.</p>
    <p>If CCAs are meant to de­velop chil­dren holis­ti­cally and to en­cour­age them to dis­cover their in­ter­ests and tal­ents, then how can we pos­si­bly say “no” to a nine-year-old girl who sim­ply wants to play foot­ball?</p>
