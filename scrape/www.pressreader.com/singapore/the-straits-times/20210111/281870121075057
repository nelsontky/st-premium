    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASHINGTON Fed­eral agents ar­rested two more Capi­tol Hill ri­ot­ers whose im­ages had gone vi­ral – one was pic­tured car­ry­ing off the House Speaker’s lectern and an­other was seen wear­ing horns and a fur pelt – while a top Demo­cratic law­maker called on mo­bile car­ri­ers to pre­serve so­cial me­dia con­tent re­lated to the car­nage.</p>
    <p>Dozens of peo­ple have been charged fol­low­ing the storm­ing of the Capi­tol last Wed­nes­day, with the Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion (FBI) ask­ing the public to help iden­tify par­tic­i­pants, given the pro­lif­er­a­tion of im­ages of the ri­ots on the In­ter­net. Five peo­ple died, in­clud­ing a po­lice of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>Ja­cob An­thony Chans­ley, who fea­tured promi­nently on so­cial me­dia wear­ing horns, a fur pelt and face paint and bran­dish­ing a spear adorned with the US flag, turned him­self in to po­lice, the Depart­ment of Jus­tice (DOJ) said.</p>
    <p>Chans­ley, also known as Jake An­geli, called the FBI’s Washington of­fice on Thurs­day and later told agents “he came as part of a group ef­fort with other ‘pa­tri­ots’ from Ari­zona, at the re­quest of the Pres­i­dent that all ‘pa­tri­ots’ come to DC on Jan 6”, the DOJ said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Fed­eral agents also ar­rested Adam Chris­tian John­son. A photo of him smil­ing and wav­ing as he car­ried off House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s lectern had also gone vi­ral.</p>
    <p>John­son, of Par­rish, Florida, also streamed live video footage on Face­book of him­self as he walked the halls of the Capi­tol, ac­cord­ing to the Tampa Bay Times. The video has been re­moved from on­line plat­forms and all of John­son’s pages have been taken down.</p>
    <p>On Satur­day, Sen­a­tor Mark Warner, a Demo­crat who is the in­com­ing chair­man of the Se­nate In­tel­li­gence Com­mit­tee, wrote to the chief ex­ec­u­tives of 11 mo­bile car­ri­ers and so­cial me­dia com­pa­nies, urg­ing them to pre­serve con­tent and associated meta­data con­nected to the riot, which erupted as law­mak­ers gath­ered to cer­tify the elec­tion of Demo­cratic Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>In his let­ters, Mr Warner em­pha­sised how the ri­ot­ers took time to doc­u­ment the event and share it through so­cial me­dia and text mes­sages “to cel­e­brate their dis­dain for our demo­cratic process”.</p>
    <p>Be­fore his ar­rest, NBC net­work re­ported, Chans­ley gloated about how the crowd in­fil­trated the Capi­tol, forc­ing law­mak­ers to flee.</p>
    <p>He faces sev­eral fed­eral charges, in­clud­ing vi­o­lent en­try and dis­or­derly con­duct on Capi­tol grounds.</p>
    <p>One man who was ar­rested in con­nec­tion with the events at the Capi­tol and threats to law­mak­ers told FBI agents he ar­rived in Washington on Thurs­day, a day late for the rally, after be­ing de­layed en route in Ohio, fed­eral court doc­u­ments showed.</p>
    <p>Cleve­land Mered­ith was found with a Ta­vor X95 as­sault ri­fle, a Glock pis­tol and hun­dreds of rounds of am­mu­ni­tion, and was de­tained in con­nec­tion with mak­ing threats to Mrs Pelosi after an FBI agent read a Jan 7 text mes­sage in which Mered­ith talked about “putting a bul­let in her nog­gin on Live TV” and running her over with his truck, ac­cord­ing to a crim­i­nal com­plaint.</p>
    <p>At least a dozen other peo­ple were fac­ing crim­i­nal charges in the US District Court for the District of Columbia in con­nec­tion to the riot, and at least an­other 40 peo­ple faced lesser charges in the District of Columbia Su­pe­rior Court.</p>
