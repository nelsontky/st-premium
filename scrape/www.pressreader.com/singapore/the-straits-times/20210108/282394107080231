    <p>• Liver­pool manager Jur­gen Klopp in­sisted he is tak­ing the FA Cup se­ri­ously de­spite the Reds’ dis­ap­point­ing record in the com­pe­ti­tion un­der his man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>The Premier League cham­pi­ons have crashed out in the third round once and three times in the fourth round since Klopp took charge of the club in 2015.</p>
    <p>Last sea­son, they reached the fifth round but lost 2-0 to even­tual fi­nal­ists Chelsea. They travel to As­ton Villa for to­day’s third-round tie al­though there is a chance the match could be post­poned af­ter Villa re­ported fresh Covid-19 cases in their first-team squad.</p>
    <p>Klopp said: “The FA Cup is im­por­tant. We didn’t go far so far.</p>
    <p>Not blessed with sen­sa­tional draws, now Villa is tough too.</p>
    <p>“Al­ways taken it se­ri­ously but we can­not for­get in­ten­sity of the period. We are pro­fes­sion­als and only thing we have to do is win.”</p>
    <p>Villa have beaten Liver­pool once this sea­son when they thrashed the Reds 7-2 in the Premier League in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Klopp’s men will en­ter this clash on the back of a 1-0 de­feat at Southamp­ton on Mon­day, which made it three games without a vic­tory in the league. Sec­ond-placed Manch­ester United are level on points with a game in hand.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool’s away form is also wor­ry­ing, hav­ing won just one of their last seven games. But Klopp be­lieves that his side have not done too badly de­spite win­ning only two of their pre­vi­ous six league matches.</p>
    <p>“We don’t en­joy it (the poor run). But not too many re­ally bad games, we cre­ate a lot, shoot a lot, but de­ci­sion mak­ing in last third was not good. Not the stan­dard we ex­pect of our­selves,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We need to find a bal­ance of a team we haven’t changed too much. We need some fresh legs. The op­po­nent is too strong for us to make whole­sale changes.”</p>
    <p>Joe Gomez, Virgil van Dijk, Diogo Jota, Kostas Tsimikas, Naby Keita, Joel Matip are all still side­lined but Klopp said he is un­likely to sign a cen­tral de­fender this month as cover and he would look within the squad for op­tions.</p>
    <p>Villa will miss Wes­ley and Trezeguet, while Ross Barkley is doubt­ful. Dean Smith’s side are en­joy­ing an im­pres­sive league cam­paign and are eighth in the stand­ings hav­ing nar­rowly avoided rel­e­ga­tion on the last day of last sea­son. But Villa said they had closed their train­ing ground and can­celled yes­ter­day’s train­ing ses­sion, as a num­ber of play­ers and staff went into iso­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“A sec­ond round of test­ing was car­ried out im­me­di­ately and pro­duced more pos­i­tive re­sults to­day,” Villa said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Derby in­terim manager Wayne Rooney and his en­tire first team will miss to­mor­row’s trip to sixth-tier Chor­ley due to nine pos­i­tive Covid-19 tests among play­ers and staff. The Rams will in­stead send a group of play­ers from the club’s Un­der-23 and U-18 teams.</p>
    <p>Southamp­ton’s match against Shrews­bury Town will not take place as sched­uled to­mor­row af­ter the third-tier team re­ported sev­eral cases in their squad.</p>
    <p>Shrews­bury in­formed the FA that they did not have enough fit play­ers who were not in self-iso­la­tion to ful­fil the fix­ture.</p>
