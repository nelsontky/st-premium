    <p>As the Covid-19 out­break in­ten­si­fies and ac­cel­er­ates large-scale so­cio-eco­nomic and tech­nol­ogy trends, there will be last­ing ef­fects on how peo­ple live, work and in­ter­act with one an­other. This ap­plies to ed­u­ca­tion too. Across the world, stu­dents have been shut out of class­rooms. Where schools have stayed open, tests have been in­ter­rupted and lessons moved on­line. Rapid shifts in the em­ploy­ment land­scape, made starker by the pan­demic, have also called into ques­tion what sort of fu­ture schools are pre­par­ing stu­dents for. This has made more ur­gent the need to en­sure that the ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem here equips Sin­ga­pore­ans with the abil­ity to learn, work and thrive in a dis­rupted and sig­nif­i­cantly changed world.</p>
    <p>The most press­ing task is to en­sure that ed­u­ca­tion con­tin­ues to en­able chil­dren from dis­ad­van­taged homes to level up to their peers. For in­stance, schools with a higher pro­por­tion of such stu­dents could re­ceive more state sup­port to or­gan­ise af­ter-school pro­grammes – a needs-based re­sourc­ing ap­proach which the Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter al­luded to in his speech last week. Stu­dents must also be al­lowed to ex­cel across mul­ti­ple path­ways, with each child – and school – thriv­ing in his – and its – area of in­ter­est or spe­cial­i­sa­tion. A care­ful bal­ance will have to be struck be­tween gen­er­al­ist cour­ses, deep skills, and vo­ca­tional train­ing, so that stu­dents meet the needs of in­dus­try and are pre­pared for the work­ing world.</p>
    <p>The third task is to de­velop at­ti­tudes and skills which can­not be re­placed by ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence. Home-based learn­ing dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker has shown that stu­dents are ca­pa­ble of be­ing more self-di­rected in their learn­ing and can adapt to a more un­struc­tured en­vi­ron­ment. This presents new op­por­tu­ni­ties for blended learn­ing and “flipped” class­rooms. This in­creases stu­dent en­gage­ment by hav­ing them com­plete readings on their own at home, so that they can con­cen­trate on live prob­lem-solv­ing dur­ing les­son time in school. In­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing should pro­vide more op­por­tu­ni­ties for stu­dents to col­lab­o­rate with in­dus­try on in­no­va­tive re­al­life ap­pli­ca­tions and en­trepreneur­ship projects.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal piece of the puz­zle is in­ter-dis­ci­plinary learn­ing. This will sup­port ca­reer mo­bil­ity and cog­ni­tive agility – qual­i­ties that are im­por­tant in a world where prob­lems and their so­lu­tions are in­creas­ingly cross-cut­ting in na­ture. Uni­ver­si­ties here have kick-started this process by re­view­ing their cur­ricu­lum, so as to give stu­dents wider ex­po­sure across dif­fer­ent sub­jects. Soon, all stu­dents may need to mas­ter foun­da­tional com­pe­ten­cies in ar­eas such as data and dig­i­tal lit­er­acy. For those who have grad­u­ated, more in­vest­ments are also be­ing made in life­long ed­u­ca­tion and train­ing. The shape of the fu­ture may not be en­tirely clear, but the goal is to make sure that ev­ery­one is ad­e­quately pre­pared for it.</p>
