    <p>BEI­JING • China has ap­proved a wealth man­age­ment joint ven­ture be­tween Amer­i­can as­set man­ager Black­Rock, Singapore’s in­vest­ment com­pany Te­masek and China Con­struc­tion Bank, as China grad­u­ally opens up its fi­nan­cial sec­tor to in­ter­na­tional firms.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment, which con­firms what peo­ple with di­rect knowl­edge of the mat­ter told Reuters last De­cem­ber, was an­nounced on the web­site of the China Bank­ing and In­sur­ance Reg­u­la­tory Com­mis­sion (CBIRC) last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The ar­ti­cle gave no fur­ther de­tails about the ven­ture or what ser­vices it would be of­fer­ing.</p>
    <p>The deal comes as China’s govern­ment looks to open up its fi­nan­cial mar­ket to for­eign firms, of­fer­ing po­ten­tially rich re­wards for in­ter­na­tional fund man­agers and oth­ers in the broader fi­nan­cial sec­tor. to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>The pain ex­tends to big com­pa­nies too. G2000 Ap­parel, a pro­fes­sional work­wear chain with about 40 out­lets, was forced to close two of its stores tem­po­rar­ily in Har­bour City, Hong Kong’s big­gest mall, on Aug 12 be­cause it could not pay the full rent for the past few months, said founder Michael Tien.</p>
    <p>The court bailiff will auc­tion off the store’s in­ven­tory on be­half of the land­lord, Wharf Real Es­tate In­vest­ment Com­pany (REIC), to re­coup the missed pay­ments, said Mr Tien.</p>
    <p>“If the land­lord was a heav­ily in­debted in­di­vid­ual, then I’d un­der­stand their strug­gle when I couldn’t pay rent,” Mr Tien said.</p>
    <p>“But these listed com­pa­nies have earn­ings in the multi-mil­lions every year, and they are still a stake­holder in so­ci­ety even though they may be mak­ing a loss right now.”</p>
    <p>OTHER NA­TIONS</p>
    <p>Wharf REIC, a de­vel­oper with rev­enue of HK$16 bil­lion last year and a mar­ket value of HK$95 bil­lion, said it ex­tended HK$1 bil­lion to ten­ants in the first half of this year.</p>
    <p>Top global fi­nan­cial play­ers have long sought to in­crease their pres­ence in the rel­a­tively fast-grow­ing Chi­nese econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Last Oc­to­ber, China scrapped some re­stric­tions on for­eign banks’ op­er­a­tions in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Two months later, France-based Amundi – Europe’s largest as­set man­ager – and Bank of China Wealth Man­age­ment won ap­proval to set up a joint ven­ture, while banks such as UBS and JP­Mor­gan Chase have been al­lowed to set up ma­jor­ity-owned China ven­tures.</p>
    <p>But the Chi­nese in­dus­try re­mains dom­i­nated by do­mes­tic state firms</p>
    <p>It de­clined to com­ment on G2000, cit­ing con­fi­den­tial­ity agree­ments.</p>
    <p>Pleas from re­tail­ers and their in­dus­try as­so­ci­a­tion for ex­tended help have largely been ig­nored, though some de­vel­op­ers pro­vided rent breaks of 10 per cent to 50 per cent start­ing in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, re­tail­ers in the US have been able to cush­ion the blow with US$40.4 bil­lion (S$55.4 bil­lion) in fed­eral aid, while Singapore and Bri­tain have schemes to pre­vent evic­tion.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s govern­ment, which of­fered one-time re­lief to re­tail­ers of up to HK$80,000 in March, has ver­bally urged land­lords to pro­vide sup­port, but has not leg­is­lated any­thing.</p>
    <p>Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam “has re­peat­edly men­tioned in pub­lic that she has ap­pealed to the real es­tate sec­tor that, as land­lords, they should ride out the dif­fi­cult times with their ten­ants to­gether”, said a govern­ment spokesman.</p>
    <p>FLAT ‘NO’</p>
    <p>Mr Tommy Che­ung, a mem­ber of Mrs Lam’s ad­vi­sory coun­cil, said she re­sponded with a “flat no” when he and China has yet to open up some more sen­si­tive ar­eas of its fi­nan­cial in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>CBIRC said more for­eign fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions are ex­pected to join or ex­pand in the Chi­nese mar­ket, and are do­ing their due dili­gence be­fore en­ter­ing. Some have sub­mit­ted pre­lim­i­nary ap­pli­ca­tions to open a unit, it said.</p>
    <p>“It is ex­pected that more for­eign in­sti­tu­tions will par­tic­i­pate in China’s fi­nan­cial mar­ket in the com­ing pe­riod and be­come a vi­able force for the high-qual­ity de­vel­op­ment of China’s fi­nan­cial in­dus­try,” CBIRC said. sug­gested she pro­vide more sup­port for restau­rants and other re­tail­ers.</p>
    <p>He is propos­ing the govern­ment pay two months’ rent for ten­ants who have lost more than 30 per cent of their rev­enue, and leg­is­late that land­lords pro­vide an ad­di­tional two months’ re­lief.</p>
    <p>Mr Che­ung said Mrs Lam has called the land­lords and urged them to get on board and give re­duc­tions be­fore “all hell breaks loose”.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Che­ung: “I’m hop­ing the land­lords will come through. But noth­ing is for sure un­til we have leg­is­la­tion that makes them do it.”</p>
    <p>In Hong Kong, land­lords have con­sid­er­able clout.</p>
    <p>Seven of the 10 rich­est peo­ple in the city made their for­tunes from prop­erty, with a com­bined net worth of more than US$100 bil­lion, ac­cord­ing to the Bloomberg Bil­lion­aires In­dex.</p>
    <p>The four big­gest de­vel­op­ers – CK As­set Hold­ings, Sun Hung Kai Prop­er­ties, New World De­vel­op­ment and Hen­der­son Land De­vel­op­ment – own every­thing from the city’s most ex­pen­sive sky­scrapers to su­per­mar­ket chains and elec­tric­ity sup­pli­ers.</p>
    <p>A CBIRC spokesman also said in an in­ter­view pub­lished on the watch­dog’s web­site last Satur­day that China will pro­vide sup­port for its fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions which are do­ing busi­ness in Hong Kong, while com­ply­ing with reg­u­la­tions and of­fer­ing ser­vices to res­i­dents and com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>CBIRC pledged its back­ing for Hong Kong as a fi­nance hub and re­it­er­ated a com­mit­ment to open­ing up the Chi­nese fi­nan­cial sec­tor amid a deep­en­ing stand-off with the United States.</p>
    <p>Ten­sions be­tween the US and China over Hong Kong have</p>
    <p>In Cause­way Bay, where some of the ty­coons’ malls are lo­cated, street-shop rents eclipse even New York’s Fifth Av­enue and the Champs-El­y­sees in Paris, ac­cord­ing to data from Cush­man & Wake­field.</p>
    <p>Sun Hung Kai de­clined to com­ment on rent re­lief. The last time it of­fered con­ces­sions was in April.</p>
    <p>New World De­vel­op­ment said it had of­fered rent re­duc­tions ac­cord­ing to ten­ant needs, with­out spec­i­fy­ing the amount. CK As­set and Hen­der­son Land did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to re­quests for com­ment.</p>
    <p>To be sure, land­lords face their own chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>Prop­erty sales have been slow as buy­ers avoid go­ing out, and the of­fice va­cancy rate is at its high­est in more than a decade.</p>
    <p>Prom­i­nent land­lords like Swire Prop­er­ties and Wharf REIC saw their prop­erty val­u­a­tions re­duced.</p>
    <p>The in­dex track­ing the city’s de­vel­op­ers has plunged 19 per cent this year, more than any other in­dus­try group.</p>
    <p>Hen­der­son Land saw its net in­come slump by 62 per cent for the first six months of this year, mainly sparked tit-for-tat sanc­tions on politi­cians and of­fi­cials on both sides that have left global bank­ing in­sti­tu­tions walk­ing a tightrope be­tween the two world pow­ers.</p>
    <p>A new na­tional se­cu­rity law has fu­elled con­cerns about the state of Hong Kong’s au­ton­omy from China, in­clud­ing free­dom of the press and the in­de­pen­dence of its ju­di­cial sys­tem. Both have helped un­der­pin Hong Kong’s rep­u­ta­tion as a global fi­nan­cial hub.</p>
    <p>The US has also ended pref­er­en­tial trad­ing treat­ment for the city, which Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and his team say was now es­sen­tially just an­other Chi­nese city.</p>
    <p>CBIRC said: “At present, Hong Kong’s fi­nan­cial mar­ket is gen­er­ally op­er­at­ing smoothly, and the linked ex­change rate sys­tem has a solid foun­da­tion, which also re­flects the con­fi­dence of the in­ter­na­tional mar­ket in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>“Hong Kong’s sta­tus as an in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial cen­tre will not be weak­ened and shaken, but it will be­come more pros­per­ous and sta­ble in the fu­ture.”</p>

    <p>due to a loss of HK$2.3 bil­lion in value for its in­vest­ment prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>“Big land­lords have to be re­spon­si­ble to their share­hold­ers,” said Mr Si­mon Lee, co-di­rec­tor of the In­ter­na­tional Busi­ness and Chi­nese En­ter­prise Pro­gramme at the Chi­nese Univer­sity of Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>“If they re­duce rents, it would af­fect their val­u­a­tions. So they ei­ther don’t do it, or cut rents just by a small por­tion.”</p>
    <p>Even though they risk los­ing ten­ants with evic­tions, land­lords are con­fi­dent they can find re­place­ments once the pan­demic eases, said Mr Patrick Wong, an an­a­lyst with Bloomberg In­tel­li­gence.</p>
    <p>“They aren’t too wor­ried about not get­ting ten­ants if some of their space is va­cant, es­pe­cially when they have prop­er­ties in prime lo­ca­tions,” he added.</p>
