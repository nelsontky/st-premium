    <p>While we shower praise on coro­n­avirus front-line staff, some pan­demic work­ers were de­spised dur­ing the world’s worst-ever out­break in the 1300s – none more so than Italy’s in­fa­mous “Bec­chini” body col­lec­tors.</p>
    <p>All across Italy, homes were boarded up. Hid­den inside, ter­ri­fied res­i­dents hud­dled to­gether, pray­ing they would not be the next vic­tims of a virus out­break that had killed more than half the pop­u­la­tion in some Ital­ian cities.</p>
    <p>Oc­ca­sion­ally, a ruckus was heard in the streets. Whistling, singing or even laugh­ter would drift into the for­ti­fied homes.</p>
    <p>You see, not ev­ery­one was scared of the Black Death. Some Ital­ians, in fact, saw op­por­tu­nity amid this cri­sis. If you pos­sessed the courage, the com­po­sure, the reck­less­ness to stare down the bubonic plague, you could po­ten­tially make a small for­tune.</p>
    <p>That was the ethos of one group of bold men. Rather than hol­ing up and wait­ing for the pan­demic to abate, they took a job no one else would. Called the Bec­chini, they were Italy’s corpse col­lec­tors.</p>
    <p>Un­like our ad­mired coro­n­avirus front-line work­ers, the Bec­chini were hated and feared.</p>
    <p>They didn’t just gather and bury the bod­ies of plague vic­tims. Sens­ing the chance to make easy money, some ran­sacked the houses of the dead, ex­torted money from fam­i­lies, and even threat­ened to mur­der ill peo­ple to cre­ate new “busi­ness”.</p>
    <p>I was shocked when I learnt the sor­did story of the Bec­chini on one of my most re­cent trips to Italy. Fas­ci­nated by what I had read about the plague’s last­ing im­pact on this na­tion, I de­cided to visit a host of an­cient sites linked to the Black Death.</p>
    <p>In a quiet side street in down­town Mi­lan, I came across a church which dates back nearly 1,800 years where many plague vic­tims were given fu­ner­als.</p>
    <p>Mod­est i n size by Mi­lanese stan­dards, the red-brick church of San Sim­pli­ciano was a place of refuge dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>So, too, was Santo Ste­fano church, which I found in the un­der­rated north­ern Ital­ian city of Bologna. One of the high­lights of Bologna’s won­der­fully authen­tic Old Town area, this sprawl­ing com­plex of reli­gious struc­tures is al­most 1,500 years old.</p>
    <p>Bologna was also dev­as­tated by the Black Death, but avoided the apoc­a­lyp­tic scenes i n Florence, where bod­ies were piled up in the grounds of the Santa Maria Novella church.</p>
    <p>As I ad­mired the in­tri­cately dec­o­rated fa­cade of this church, I found it dif­fi­cult to imag­ine the grim events that un­folded here.</p>
    <p>While the coro­n­avirus is un­like any­thing we have ex­pe­ri­enced, imag­ine be­ing in Europe in 1347. Each day, news ar­rived of another vil­lage, town or city that had been dec­i­mated by a fe­ro­cious virus creep­ing across the con­ti­nent from east to west.</p>
    <p>Un­like Covid-19, which spread rapidly due to air travel, the march of the Black Death was slow and steady. Orig­i­nat­ing in China, the plague ad­vanced along the trade routes that con­nected Asia with the Mediter­ranean and North Africa. By 1347, it had ar­rived in Italy, be­fore reach­ing France, Spain, and Eng­land in 1348, and then mov­ing into north­ern Europe over the next two years.</p>
    <p>The Ital­ians were not af­forded a warn­ing. While many other Euro­pean na­tions knew what was com­ing, the plague am­bushed Italy.</p>
    <p>As I stood in the Pi­azza della Sig­no­ria, Florence’s main pub­lic square, I con­sid­ered the chaos and ter­ror that had gripped this city. This me­trop­o­lis in Tus­cany was hit harder than al­most any other part of Italy.</p>
    <p>A thriv­ing hub of art, fash­ion and com­merce, Florence in the 1340s was a densely pop­u­lated city of about 100,000 peo­ple. Some his­to­ri­ans be­lieve up to two-thirds of its res­i­dents were killed by the Black Death.</p>
    <p>The task of col­lect­ing and bury­ing these corpses was so per­ilous that Italy’s reg­u­lar sys­tem for dis­pos­ing of the dead broke down. Char­i­ties and churches that pre­vi­ously or­gan­ised such ser­vices for free were no longer able to get will­ing staff.</p>
    <p>En­ter the Bec­chini. Mostly from the lower classes or of crim­i­nal back­grounds, these men filled the breach. For a fee, they would come to a home, col­lect a dead body and then bury it.</p>
    <p>But they were not Good Sa­mar­i­tans. Ruth­less, un­scrupu­lous and dan­ger­ous – that was how most Florence res­i­dents viewed the Bec­chini.</p>
    <p>At best, they charged high prices to col­lect bod­ies. Fam­i­lies un­will­ing to pay these hefty fees were stuck liv­ing along­side the bod­ies of their de­ceased rel­a­tives.</p>
    <p>At worst, the Bec­chini ran amok, tak­ing ad­van­tage of oth­ers’ mis­ery. Com­monly, they would steal the valu­ables of the corpse.</p>
    <p>Some­times, this would es­ca­late into rob­bery of the de­ceased’s fam­ily. Fam­ily mem­bers who re­fused to pay up were some­times as­saulted or even re­ceived mur­der threats.</p>
    <p>The Bec­chini be­came as de­spised as the plague it­self. That is why they were given that name – de­rived from the Ital­ian verb “bec­care”, which</p>
    <p>Ruth­less, un­scrupu­lous and dan­ger­ous – that was how most Florence res­i­dents viewed the Bec­chini. At best, they charged high prices to col­lect bod­ies. Fam­i­lies un­will­ing to pay were stuck liv­ing along­side the bod­ies of their de­ceased rel­a­tives. At worst, the Bec­chini ran amok, tak­ing ad­van­tage of oth­ers’ mis­ery.</p>
    <p>means to peck at some­thing for sus­te­nance. In this way, Ital­ians per­ceived the Bec­chini as feed­ing off the dead. They were hu­man vul­tures.</p>
    <p>Seven cen­turies later, these scav­engers en­tered my mind as I stared at a wall of hu­man skulls and bones in a room inside Mi­lan’s San Bernardino alle Ossa church.</p>
    <p>Care­fully ar­ranged to cre­ate a num­ber of pat­terns, in­clud­ing a Catholic cross, it is be­lieved that some of these hu­man re­mains were plague vic­tims.</p>
    <p>This room and its con­tents are un­de­ni­ably macabre. Yet, af­ter a few min­utes, I be­gan to see these ar­range­ments of hu­man rem­nants as in­spir­ing and unique.</p>
    <p>They rep­re­sent the cre­ativ­ity of hu­mans. They show­case our abil­ity to adapt to hard­ship. They high­light our ca­pac­ity for cre­at­ing beauty from tragedy. Even the ghoul­ish Bec­chini could not tar­nish that.</p>
