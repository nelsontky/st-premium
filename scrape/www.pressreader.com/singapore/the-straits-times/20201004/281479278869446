    <p>Ms Gil­lian Tee pulls a face and moans: “I’m tired.”</p>
    <p>Her voice drips with mock woe, but the fa­tigue is real. Since the pan­demic started, the 37-year-old founder of Homage – a home and nurs­ing care start-up – has been pulling long days and late nights.</p>
    <p>“We never ex­pected to play such a role in the fight against Covid-19,” says Ms Tee, whose out­fit has trained and been field­ing an army of about 400 health pro­fes­sion­als to, among other things, op­er­ate mo­bile health screen­ing sta­tions, carry out swab test­ing and give telemedici­ne con­sul­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>“They have gone into quar­an­tine zones, nurs­ing homes, hos­pi­tals and mi­grant worker com­mu­ni­ties and dor­mi­to­ries,” she says proudly.</p>
    <p>In­deed, Homage has come a long way from 2017, when it be­gan as an app match­ing clients who need home-based care to a pool of about 250 nurses.</p>
    <p>In three years, that pool has grown ten­fold and now boasts a net­work of about 3,000 care pro­fes­sion­als, in­clud­ing doc­tors and phys­io­ther­a­pists.</p>
    <p>Be­yond just el­der­care, Homage of­fers a suite of home and nurs­ing care ser­vices – from med­i­cal es­cort­ing to fa­cil­ity-based care in hos­pi­tal wards to sup­port for chil­dren with mus­cu­lar dys­tro­phy and other ill­nesses or dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“Our team no longer just goes into homes, but also day­care cen­tres, nurs­ing homes and hos­pi­tals,” says Ms Tee.</p>
    <p>The events of the last nine months have also shown that Homage can play a crit­i­cal role in the event of a health cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus was a bolt from the blue, Ms Tee says. “We just felt this strong sense of ur­gency to act be­cause we knew that with the num­ber of health­care pro­fes­sion­als on our plat­form, we couldn’t sit back and needed to be a part of the so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>“At a time like this, do we hide in a cor­ner and cover our faces? No,” she says em­phat­i­cally.</p>
    <p>Still, she was blown away by just how many in her team rose to the oc­ca­sion.</p>
    <p>“The re­spon­ders all raised their hands and said ‘count me in’,” she says. “They could have cho­sen to take a back seat, but in­stead con­tin­ued to help those who needed help and stayed true to the health­care and care­giv­ing pro­fes­sion of be­ing there in good and bad times.”</p>
    <p>The pan­demic, she says, has been good for busi­ness “but not in the kind of tra­jec­tory we ex­pected”.</p>
    <p>“But it has cer­tainly con­sol­i­dated our be­lief in what we do,” she says.</p>
    <p>Homage has ex­panded into Malaysia and raised more than $10 mil­lion in Se­ries B fund­ing ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Psy­chol­o­gist Jef­frey Ar­nett of Clark Univer­sity once de­scribed mil­len­ni­als – those born be­tween 1981 and 1996 – as “an ex­cep­tion­ally gen­er­ous gen­er­a­tion that holds great prom­ise for im­prov­ing the world”.</p>
    <p>Ms Tee – who has a Master of Busi­ness Ad­min­is­tra­tion from Columbia Busi­ness School as well as a master’s in in­ter­na­tional af­fairs from Columbia Univer­sity – cer­tainly lives up to that de­scrip­tion.</p>
    <p>Although she was en­joy­ing a heady ca­reer in New York and Sil­i­con Val­ley, where she co­founded Rock­etrip, a suc­cess­ful travel start-up, she gave up that glitzy life to start Homage.</p>
    <p>The rea­son? She has a soft spot for the el­derly, hav­ing been lov­ingly raised by her nanny and ma­ter­nal grand­mother.</p>
    <p>Per­son­ally and pro­fes­sion­ally cu­ri­ous – she was also once an ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence re­searcher, soft­ware en­gi­neer and tech­nol­ogy con­sul­tant – she be­lieves in liv­ing life on her own terms.</p>
    <p>She started out with a dream to lever­age tech­nol­ogy to im­prove se­nior care in Sin­ga­pore, but now wants to in­clude the whole de­cen­tralised care con­tin­uum.</p>
    <p>Build­ing Homage, she says, has been a pro­found jour­ney of per­sonal growth. “I wouldn’t trade that for any­thing in the world.”</p>
    <p>That Homage – a 2016 DBS Foun­da­tion So­cial En­ter­prise Grant awardee – has a so­cial im­pact is some­thing which makes her proud.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one is go­ing through an ex­is­ten­tial cri­sis. What does it mean to per­son­ally care? How can I be there? What do I do to be there? Let’s care about things that mat­ter. Let’s play a part and make it count.”</p>
    <p>You were in your early 30s when you started Homage. Isn’t el­der­care an odd busi­ness idea for some­one so young?</p>
    <p>I lived with my two grand­moth­ers while grow­ing up and I was also close to my el­derly nanny, who was em­ployed by my par­ents to help look after me since I was a baby.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, I am fa­mil­iar with the dif­fi­cul­ties, lik­ings, think­ing, prob­lems which are faced by se­niors. Fun­da­men­tally, the el­derly are peo­ple who are sim­ply us, but in a dif­fer­ent stage of life and their needs trans­late across from their de­sire to con­tinue con­tribut­ing to those around them.</p>
    <p>Like us, many also need help even when they are not sick. So, I see our­selves very much in the busi­ness of sim­ply well­ness, health and care­giv­ing, which im­pacts the en­tire fam­ily unit.</p>
    <p>Ap­par­ently, you do not like to have things too easy and pre­fer to learn the hard way. How well has this at­ti­tude served you in life?</p>
    <p>It has def­i­nitely taken me down paths filled with ad­ven­tures. I think fun­da­men­tally, over­com­ing tough times builds grit and that trans­lates to con­tin­ued per­sonal growth.</p>
    <p>Not back­ing down from chal­lenges has been cru­cial in my jour­ney as an en­tre­pre­neur be­cause I en­counter set­backs al­most on a daily ba­sis. You just have to keep learning and not re­lent in spite of fail­ures, mis­steps or chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, it’s helped me build a team and make an im­pact. Homage, at the end of the day, is a busi­ness with a mission and we’re se­ri­ous about push­ing hard and with­stand­ing tough times for a wor­thy cause.</p>
    <p>In three years, Homage has grown more than ten­fold. You started with a net­work of just over 200 nurses, but to­day, have nearly 3,000 nurses, ther­a­pists, gen­eral care­givers and doc­tors. How did that hap­pen?</p>
    <p>The Homage team made t hat hap­pen. When I look back, it’s the process of reap­ply­ing fun­da­men­tal prin­ci­ples over and over again that got us to where we are.</p>
    <p>The fun­da­men­tals of build­ing the right team; en­sur­ing we have a cul­ture that em­braces change and a growth mind­set; en­sur­ing we are rig­or­ous, move fast and to­wards a sin­gle fo­cal point; and the im­pact of con­stant reap­pli­ca­tion of these fun­da­men­tals when mak­ing mi­cro de­ci­sions com­pounds over time.</p>
    <p>You can achieve much more than you can imag­ine, given the right alchemy of peo­ple fo­cus­ing on solv­ing a wor­thy prob­lem.</p>
    <p>How has Covid-19 been a game changer for Homage?</p>
    <p>A thought I carry with me nowa­days is that if we can go through the past year, we can go through any­thing as a team.</p>
    <p>When the Dorscon turned orange, we started to build a task force that was PCR (poly­merase chain re­ac­tion) swab and PPE (per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment) trained as well as mask-fit­ted. Fast for­ward nine months, we’ve built up a task force of 400 Covid-19 re­spon­ders – in­clud­ing train­ers, nurses, care aides and doc­tors.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 deep­ened and so­lid­i­fied our fun­da­men­tal be­lief that we need to build more plat­forms to en­able health­care in the com­mu­nity at scale and also in­vest in com­mu­nity care in­fras­truc­ture and pre­ven­ta­tive health pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>More than any­thing, I think the pan­demic made the Homage team stronger and more united as we came to­gether to build so­lu­tions to be­come part of the na­tional re­sponse.</p>
    <p>What are the three most pro­found lessons you have learnt about life and age­ing since you started Homage?</p>
    <p>First, en­coun­ter­ing the var­i­ous types of cases ad­dressed by Homage, I have learnt from and been in­spired by our own care pro­fes­sion­als the worth of per­sonal sac­ri­fice, ded­i­ca­tion and de­vo­tion to­wards help­ing oth­ers and our so­ci­ety. If you look back, it is of­ten mo­ments of per­sonal care – akin to the care I re­ceived from se­niors when I was young – that mean and count the most.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, age­ing is a nor­mal process and in­evitable. Just be­cause you pass a cer­tain age doesn’t make you a dif­fer­ent per­son. It is im­por­tant for ev­ery­one at any stage in his or her life to be treated with re­spect and dig­nity, and good phys­i­cal and men­tal health is im­por­tant for ev­ery­one – se­nior, adult, youth or child.</p>
    <p>Last, the abil­ity to link short-term ob­jec­tives to long-term goals is one of the key fac­tors for the over­all con­tin­ued growth of a busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The process de­pends on nim­ble and good de­ci­sion-mak­ing, op­ti­mis­ing how re­sources are al­lo­cated and sound peo­ple and re­la­tion­ship man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Do you be­lieve there is a rea­son for ev­ery­thing, and that ev­ery­thing you have done – per­son­ally and pro­fes­sion­ally – has some­how led you here?</p>
    <p>Def­i­nitely. Work­ing on Homage feels like com­ing full cir­cle for me. It’s com­bin­ing many of my worlds – tech­nol­ogy, busi­ness or so­cial and eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>I’m still grow­ing and feel­ing stretched on my cur­rent jour­ney, though. I feel like it’s only just be­gin­ning and I have lots more to learn.</p>
    <p>What does pur­pose mean to you?</p>
    <p>Pur­pose to me is work­ing on a cause that is per­son­ally worth­while.</p>
