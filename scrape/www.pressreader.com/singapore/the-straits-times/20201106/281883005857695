    <p>• Thai pro-democ­racy protesters plan to hold a fresh rally this week­end and pe­ti­tion King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn, a day af­ter re­ject­ing a Par­lia­ment-ini­ti­ated plan to form a com­mit­tee to ease the po­lit­i­cal ten­sions.</p>
    <p>The ac­tivists will gather at Bangkok’s Democ­racy Mon­u­ment on Sun­day be­fore hand­ing over a let­ter in sup­port of their de­mands to the King, said Free Youth, one of the protest groups, yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The protesters want the im­me­di­ate res­ig­na­tion of Prime Min­is­ter</p>
    <p>Prayut Chan-o-cha and his ad­min­is­tra­tion, a new Constituti­on and re­form of the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>“These de­mands are not an op­tion, but the only way to move the coun­try for­ward out of a cri­sis,” Free Youth said in the state­ment.</p>
    <p>The youth-led protesters have held al­most daily ral­lies in Bangkok and other cities for three weeks, trig­ger­ing counter ral­lies by pro-roy­al­ist groups op­posed to any re­form of the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>The move to pe­ti­tion the King comes days af­ter King Va­ji­ra­longkorn of­fered an olive branch to protesters in which he called Thai­land “the land of com­pro­mise”.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, the protesters re­jected a rec­on­cil­i­a­tion panel be­ing set up by Par­lia­ment, say­ing it was a “po­lit­i­cal ploy to buy time”.</p>
    <p>Pro-democ­racy groups have said that Par­lia­ment should vote on a new prime min­is­ter whose role should be lim­ited to char­ter amend­ment, adding that the Se­nate must be kept out of the process.</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut, a former army chief who took power in a 2014 coup, kept his premier­ship af­ter elec­tions last year with the help of char­ter rules writ­ten un­der his mil­i­tary gov­ern­ment and the junta-ap­pointed Se­nate.</p>
    <p>The pre­mier, who has re­peat­edly re­jected calls to quit, signed a draft law on Wed­nes­day for Par­lia­ment to de­lib­er­ate a ref­er­en­dum for char­ter amend­ment. Mr Prayut has also said he is open to chang­ing parts of the Constituti­on and tak­ing away the Se­nate’s power to elect prime min­is­ters.</p>
