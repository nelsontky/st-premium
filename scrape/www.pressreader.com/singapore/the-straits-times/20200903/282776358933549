    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>You may meet some­one new who is al­most alien in their un­der­stand­ing of life. Stick close to him or her and soak up what­ever you can.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>Things may not be go­ing your way, but stay the course. Your en­ergy is not quite right for this, but a chal­lenge can be in­vig­o­rat­ing.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Share your thoughts and feel­ings with your peo­ple. Things are good for all of you, even if at least one per­son is start­ing to freak out.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>You are feel­ing a lit­tle leery of some­one you or­di­nar­ily trust. Hon­our it and ask ques­tions to see what, if any­thing, is re­ally go­ing on.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Open your mind to new facts and ways of see­ing the world. It may take a lit­tle time for you to pick out all the de­tails, but that is time well spent.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Set­tle your bills or other fi­nan­cial is­sues, but do not just throw money at the prob­lem. Get or­gan­ised and cre­ate some­thing sus­tain­able.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Make the most of your busi­ness savvy and go for a job in­ter­view, ne­go­ti­a­tion or power lunch. You can make it work on­line or face to face.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Step back from any­thing that looks like it could be­come a fight. You do not need that en­ergy and peo­ple do not need to see your dark side.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>You take great plea­sure in a big ac­tiv­ity, even if it would usu­ally be bor­ing or a downer. Roll with it and see if you can get oth­ers to fol­low.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>En­sure reg­u­lar­ity in the day’s ac­tiv­i­ties – too much spon­tane­ity or im­pul­sive­ness will back­fire. Things can work out if you stick to the plan.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>You are feel­ing so avant-garde that you may con­fuse peo­ple – but they are sure to catch up with you even­tu­ally. En­joy the mys­tery.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>You need to deal with some­one who is not what they seem. You may not be get­ting cheated or hoaxed, but wait for the mask to come off.</p>
