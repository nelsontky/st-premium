    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans are no strangers to the ups and downs of the econ­omy and the im­pact of a sharp down­turn, not least on the re­tail sec­tor. How­ever, there was a pal­pa­ble sense of shock at news that de­part­ment store stal­wart Robin­sons was call­ing it a day af­ter 162 years. It is clos­ing its last two de­part­ment stores here at The Heeren and Raf­fles City Shop­ping Cen­tre. Its de­ci­sion to liq­ui­date the stores was prompted by a range of fac­tors, in­clud­ing chang­ing con­sumer tastes and cost pres­sures such as rent. For loyal cus­tomers, Robin­sons’ im­pend­ing de­par­ture from the re­tail scene marks the end of long­stand­ing re­la­tion­ships with the store and its staff. Af­ter all, a store founded in 1858 could not have sur­vived Sin­ga­pore’s tran­si­tion through colo­nial­ism, two world wars, and merger with Malaysia and Sep­a­ra­tion, and go on to flour­ish in in­de­pen­dent Sin­ga­pore, with­out the pa­tron­age of cus­tomers who found it wor­thy of their sup­port even in the face of chang­ing tastes and needs.</p>
    <p>Par­ents handed down their en­gage­ment with the store, per­son­i­fied by its staff, to their chil­dren. One cus­tomer, who re­marked that Robin­sons was an old friend, summed up the sen­ti­ments of those Sin­ga­pore­ans who see the store as an iconic in­sti­tu­tion. A 69-year-old cashier, who has worked at Robin­sons for nearly 50 years, ex­em­pli­fies the store’s loy­alty to its staff, which mir­rors its cus­tomers’ loy­alty to it. Un­for­tu­nately, even so­cial re­la­tion­ships built up over time can­not evade the in­ex­orable laws of sup­ply and de­mand that de­ter­mine the health of economies and their re­tail sec­tor. Robin­sons’ clo­sure drama­tises con­cerns over whether the over­ar­ch­ing busi­ness model of de­part­ment stores is out­dated.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic, which ne­ces­si­tated se­vere re­stric­tions on hu­man traf­fic, ac­cel­er­ated trends in which brick-and-mor­tar stores stood in dan­ger of be­ing out­paced by e-com­merce and di­rect-to-con­sumer chan­nels. Fun­da­men­tally, phys­i­cal stores acted as a re­tail in­ter­face be­tween pro­duc­ers and ware­houses – where the prod­uct and sale process es­sen­tially starts – and con­sumers, who de­cide what and whether to buy based on their vis­ual and prac­ti­cal ex­pe­ri­ence of goods and the pro­mo­tional skills of re­tail staff.</p>
    <p>In the process, de­part­ment stores in­cur sub­stan­tial ex­penses of salary and rent that have to be jus­ti­fied by pur­chases. These bur­dens are re­duced for e-com­merce plat­forms, whose web­sites pay no rent and whose em­ploy­ees do not have to of­fer per­son­alised ser­vice to po­ten­tial cus­tomers. De­part­ment stores thus mul­ti­cast their ap­peal on both the phys­i­cal premises and vir­tual plat­forms, but the lat­ter are cheaper. Per­haps in the years to come, de­part­ment stores will be­come a mat­ter of the past. Yet, nos­tal­gia can­not but turn sad when a old and fa­mil­iar brand name like Robin­sons falls vic­tim to the times.</p>
