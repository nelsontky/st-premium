    <p>WASH­ING­TON • US gov­er­nors from the coastal states of New Jersey and Cal­i­for­nia and the heart­land of Iowa and Ohio have acted to re­strict gath­er­ings and boost face cov­er­ings in con­fronting a coro­n­avirus surge that they warned is out of con­trol.</p>
    <p>Each of the four gov­er­nors, rep­re­sent­ing both ends of Amer­ica’s po­lit­i­cal di­vide and a mix of ur­ban and ru­ral re­gions, on Mon­day cited health data show­ing the pan­demic reach­ing its most per­ilous point yet in the United States, threat­en­ing to over­whelm hos­pi­tals and claim thou­sands more lives in the weeks ahead.</p>
    <p>They ac­knowl­edged that tighter lim­its on so­cial in­ter­ac­tions would prove es­pe­cially dif­fi­cult through the winter hol­i­days. But with­out ef­forts to im­me­di­ately tamp down the spread of the virus, they warned, more dras­tic ac­tion would be nec­es­sary in the near fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Health ex­perts have pro­jected that the com­ing hol­i­day travel sea­son and the on­set of colder weather, with more peo­ple tend­ing to con­gre­gate in­doors, are likely to worsen the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>More than 70,000 Amer­i­cans were hos­pi­talised for treat­ment of Covid-19 as of Mon­day, the most at any time since the pan­demic be­gan, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters tally of pub­lic health fig­ures.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of US cases doc­u­mented to date sur­passed 11 mil­lion on Mon­day, a lit­tle more than a week af­ter cross­ing the 10-mil­lion mark – the fastest time it has taken for the na­tional tally to grow by a mil­lion cases. The coun­try has av­er­aged more than 148,000 new cases a day, and 1,120 daily deaths, over the past week.</p>
    <p>The spike in cases and hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions has been es­pe­cially strik­ing in places like Iowa, a largely ru­ral, Mid­west­ern state spared the worst rav­ages of the pan­demic when it be­gan eight months ago.</p>
    <p>Iowa recorded over 52,000 new in­fec­tions in the past two weeks, about the same num­ber doc­u­mented from March to mid-Au­gust, with Covid-19 ac­count­ing for one in ev­ery four pa­tients now hos­pi­talised in the state.</p>
    <p>“No one wants to do this,” Iowa Gov­er­nor Kim Reynolds, a Repub­li­can, said in an­nounc­ing that all in­door gath­er­ings for so­cial, leisure and com­mu­nity events will be lim­ited to 15 peo­ple, with out­door gath­er­ings lim­ited to 30, wed­dings and fu­ner­als in­cluded.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, Iowa’s restau­rants and bars will be or­dered to close by 10pm, and masks will be re­quired for any­one spend­ing at least 15 min­utes in an in­door pub­lic space with­out be­ing able to so­cially dis­tance, the gov­er­nor said.</p>
    <p>Ms Reynolds said success hinged on pub­lic co­op­er­a­tion rather than en­force­ment. “If Iowans don’t buy into this, we lose,” she said at a news con­fer­ence. “Busi­nesses will close once again. More schools will be forced to go on­line, our health­care sys­tem will fail, and the cost in hu­man life will be high.”</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar mes­sages were de­liv­ered on Mon­day by the Demo­cratic gov­er­nors of Cal­i­for­nia and New Jersey and their Repub­li­can coun­ter­part in Ohio.</p>
    <p>But the new curbs are meet­ing with re­sis­tance, and it has been es­pe­cially fierce in Michi­gan, where Gov­er­nor Gretchen Whit­mer, a Demo­crat, on Sun­day said she would stop in­door din­ing, close casi­nos and cin­e­mas, and halt in­per­son learn­ing at high schools and col­leges for three weeks.</p>
    <p>A Repub­li­can state leg­is­la­tor quickly called for her to be im­peached, and Dr Scott At­las, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s coro­n­avirus ad­viser, went on Twit­ter to urge peo­ple in the state to “rise up” in protest. He later said he did not mean to in­cite vi­o­lence.</p>
