    <p>As some re­ports would have it, this is the be­gin­ning of the end. Three coro­n­avirus vac­cines have posted ex­cel­lent re­sults, with more ex­pected to come.</p>
    <p>But this is not the be­gin­ning of the end; it is only the be­gin­ning of an end­less wait: There aren’t enough vac­cines to go around in the rich­est coun­tries on earth, let alone the poor­est ones. That’s why it makes lit­tle sense that the</p>
    <p>United States, Bri­tain and the Euro­pean Union, among oth­ers, are block­ing a pro­posal at the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO) that would al­low them, and the rest of the world, to get more of the vac­cines and treat­ments we all need.</p>
    <p>The pro­posal, put for­ward by In­dia and South Africa in Oc­to­ber, calls on the WTO to ex­empt mem­ber coun­tries from en­forc­ing some patents, trade se­crets or phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal mo­nop­o­lies un­der the or­gan­i­sa­tion’s agree­ment on trade-re­lated in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty rights, known as Trips.</p>
    <p>It cites the “ex­cep­tional cir­cum­stances” cre­ated by the pan­demic and ar­gues that in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty pro­tec­tions are cur­rently “hin­der­ing or po­ten­tially hin­der­ing timely pro­vi­sion­ing of af­ford­able med­i­cal prod­ucts”; the waiver would al­low WTO mem­ber coun­tries to change their laws so that com­pa­nies there could pro­duce generic ver­sions of any coro­n­avirus vac­cines and Covid-19 treat­ments.</p>
    <p>The idea was im­me­di­ately op­posed by the US, the EU, Bri­tain, Nor­way, Switzer­land, Ja­pan, Canada, Aus­tralia and Brazil. It was op­posed again at an­other meet­ing last month, and again last week.</p>
    <p>By our count, nearly 100 coun­tries favour the pro­posal, and yet be­cause al­most all de­ci­sions at the WTO are made by con­sen­sus, a small num­ber of coun­tries can thwart the will of the ma­jor­ity, even a su­per ma­jor­ity. (The or­gan­i­sa­tion has 164 mem­bers.)</p>
    <p>The US trade rep­re­sen­ta­tive is re­ported to have said that pro­tect­ing in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty rights and oth­er­wise “fa­cil­i­tat­ing in­cen­tives for in­no­va­tion and com­pe­ti­tion” was the best way to en­sure the “swift de­liv­ery” of any vac­cines and treat­ments. The EU has ar­gued that there was “no in­di­ca­tion that in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty rights is­sues have been a gen­uine bar­rier in re­la­tion to Covid-19-re­lated medicines and tech­nolo­gies”. The Bri­tish mis­sion to the WTO agrees, char­ac­ter­is­ing the waiver pro­posal as “an ex­treme mea­sure to ad­dress an un­proven prob­lem”.</p>
    <p>In fact, the novel tech­nol­ogy at the heart of the Moderna vac­cine, for ex­am­ple, was de­vel­oped partly by the Na­tional In­sti­tutes of</p>
    <p>Health us­ing US fed­eral funds. Moderna then re­ceived a to­tal of some US$2.5 bil­lion (S$3.3 bil­lion) in tax­payer money for re­search sup­port and as pre-or­ders for vac­cines; by the com­pany’s own ad­mis­sion, the US$1 bil­lion con­tri­bu­tion it re­ceived for re­search cov­ered 100 per cent of those costs.</p>
    <p>Moderna has pledged not to en­force its “Covid-19-re­lated patents against those mak­ing vac­cines in­tended to com­bat the pan­demic”. But as Doc­tors</p>
    <p>With­out Bor­ders has pointed out, that of­fer is less gen­er­ous than it seems since other types of in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty, such as know-how or trade se­crets, typ­i­cally are needed to de­velop and pro­duce vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Pfizer, for its part, re­ceived a US$455 mil­lion grant from the Ger­man gov­ern­ment to de­velop its vac­cine, and then, by our count, nearly US$6 bil­lion in pur­chase com­mit­ments from the US and the EU.</p>
    <p>As­traZeneca ben­e­fited from some pub­lic fund­ing while it was de­vel­op­ing its vac­cine, and re­ceived a to­tal of more than</p>
    <p>US$2 bil­lion from the US and the EU for both re­search and in pur­chase com­mit­ments. It also signed a deal worth</p>
    <p>US$750 mil­lion to sup­ply the Coali­tion for Epi­demic Pre­pared­ness In­no­va­tions and Gavi, the Vac­cine Al­liance with a to­tal of 300 mil­lion doses.</p>
    <p>In other words, the vac­cines de­vel­oped by these com­pa­nies were de­vel­oped thanks wholly or partly to tax­payer money. Those vac­cines es­sen­tially be­long to the peo­ple – and yet the peo­ple are about to pay for them again, and with lit­tle prospect of get­ting as many as they need fast enough.</p>
    <p>We cal­cu­late, based on Pfizer’s and Moderna’s stated vac­cine-pro­duc­tion ca­pac­ity and their sup­ply deals with the US and the EU, as well as Ja­pan and Canada, that these coun­tries can ex­pect, at best, to have about 50 per cent of their pop­u­la­tions cov­ered by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>Con­sid­er­ing that 82 per cent of the vac­cines Pfizer says it can pro­duce through next year and 78 per cent of Moderna’s have al­ready been sold to rich coun­tries, ac­cord­ing to ad­vo­cacy group Global Jus­tice Now, imag­ine the likely short­ages and de­lays for the rest of the world. (Canada is said to have placed so many pre-or­ders that it could end up with 10 doses per capita.)</p>
    <p>As­traZeneca, to its credit, has struck deals with man­u­fac­tur­ers in In­dia and Latin Amer­ica, as well as with Gavi, to help poor coun­tries get ac­cess to its vac­cine. (It has also com­mit­ted not to make a profit from its vac­cine dur­ing the pan­demic – though, ac­cord­ing to a Fi­nan­cial Times re­port based on com­pany doc­u­ments,</p>
    <p>As­traZeneca has re­tained the right to de­clare the end of the pan­demic as early as July next year.) That said, the com­pany es­ti­mates that it will be able to make three bil­lion doses by the end of next year; that’s enough for only 20 per cent of the world’s pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Poor coun­tries have faced such prob­lems be­fore. The WTO’s cre­ation in 1995 co­in­cided with a surge of HIV/Aids in sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa. By 1996, new treat­ments were de­vel­oped that made Aids a mostly man­age­able con­di­tion – though only for peo­ple who could af­ford them.</p>
    <p>Non-generic drugs cost about US$10,000 a year at the turn of the cen­tury, and were well out of the reach of many peo­ple in, say, South Africa. It took the South African gov­ern­ment al­most a decade to break the mo­nop­o­lies held by for­eign drug com­pa­nies that kept the coun­try hostage, and kept peo­ple there dy­ing.</p>
    <p>In Brazil, Gilead Sci­ences, the mo­nop­oly owner of so­fos­bu­vir, a break­through treat­ment for hepati­tis C, has been in a dead­lock with the gov­ern­ment over ex­pand­ing and cheap­en­ing ac­cess to the drug for Brazil­ians. By sev­eral ac­counts, when Gilead Sci­ences ob­tained patents for so­fos­bu­vir early last year, it hiked the price for Brazil­ian pub­lic agen­cies from US$16 to US$240 a cap­sule. Yet that would drop to about US$8 if the drug were pro­duced lo­cally un­der a com­pul­sory li­cens­ing scheme that the Trips agree­ment al­ready al­lows in some cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>Coun­tries in which drugs are rel­a­tively cheap, such as In­dia, face an­other kind of chal­lenge: at­tempts to over­turn the laws that make those drugs ac­ces­si­ble there. No­var­tis, the Swiss phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal gi­ant, fought a decade-long bat­tle to se­cure mo­nop­oly con­trol in In­dia over its treat­ment for leukaemia, and in the process tried to have a key pro­vi­sion of In­dian patent law struck down as un­con­sti­tu­tional. (It failed on both fronts.)</p>
    <p>What’s more, the cri­sis of ac­cess to af­ford­able medicine also af­fects coun­tries whose govern­ments de­fend ex­ten­sive in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty pro­tec­tions for com­pa­nies: In­sulin, for ex­am­ple, can be pun­ish­ingly ex­pen­sive in the US.</p>
    <p>Remde­sivir, a drug used to treat Covid-19 (with mixed re­sults), is now in short sup­ply in the US and Europe. Gilead Sci­ences, remde­sivir’s man­u­fac­turer, has re­tained its mo­nop­oly over the drug in rich coun­tries, but in May it signed li­cens­ing agree­ments with com­pa­nies in 127 coun­tries so that they could pro­duce generic ver­sions for sale there.</p>
    <p>The re­sult? While there have been short­ages of the drug in the West, it has been avail­able in in­creas­ingly sta­ble sup­plies in sev­eral poor coun­tries, some­times at one-tenth of the price.</p>
    <p>But the govern­ments of rich coun­tries can push back against Big Pharma, too, and some­times have done so – de­spite the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal in­dus­try’s some­times colos­sal fi­nan­cial clout. (Cam­paign and lob­by­ing con­tri­bu­tions from drug mak­ers to the US fed­eral gov­ern­ment to­talled some US$4.7 bil­lion be­tween 1999 and 2018, ac­cord­ing to one re­cent study.)</p>
    <p>In the af­ter­math of 9/11, the US feared an an­thrax at­tack and needed un­usu­ally large sup­plies of ciprofloxa­cin from Bayer; when the gov­ern­ment threat­ened to by­pass the com­pany’s patent and buy generic al­ter­na­tives, the com­pany low­ered the price of the an­tibi­otic and in­creased sup­plies.</p>
    <p>In Bri­tain last year, fam­i­lies of chil­dren with cys­tic fi­bro­sis pe­ti­tioned the gov­ern­ment to sus­pend a com­pany’s mo­nop­oly over Orkambi, the first sig­nif­i­cant treat­ment for the dis­ease. After po­lit­i­cal par­ties threw their weight be­hind the pe­ti­tion,</p>
    <p>Ver­tex, the maker of Orkambi, agreed to sell the drug at a much lower price than it had been hold­ing out for.</p>
    <p>As for coro­n­avirus vac­cines and Covid-19 treat­ments, an­other meet­ing of the Trips Coun­cil is sched­uled for to­mor­row; on</p>
    <p>Dec 16 and 17 the WTO’s gen­eral coun­cil, one of the or­gan­i­sa­tion’s high­est de­ci­sion-mak­ing bod­ies, will meet. The US, the EU and Bri­tain are ex­pected to dig their heels in.</p>
    <p>Yet mount­ing pres­sure from poor coun­tries at the WTO should give the govern­ments of rich coun­tries lever­age to ne­go­ti­ate with their phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies for cheaper drugs and vac­cines world­wide. Lean­ing on those com­pa­nies is the right thing to do in the face of a global pan­demic; it is also the best way for the govern­ments of rich coun­tries to take care of their own pop­u­la­tions, which in some cases ex­pe­ri­ence more se­vere drug short­ages than do peo­ple in far less af­flu­ent places.</p>
    <p>Last month, the ed­i­to­rial board of The Wall Street Jour­nal de­nounced the Trips waiver pro­posal put for­ward by In­dia and South Africa as a “patent heist”, adding that “their ef­fort would harm ev­ery­one, in­clud­ing the poor”. In fact, the ef­fort would help ev­ery­one, in­clud­ing the rich – if only the rich could see that.</p>
