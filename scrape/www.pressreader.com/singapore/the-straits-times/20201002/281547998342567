    <p>Hong Kong riot po­lice were on the city’s streets in large num­bers yes­ter­day, ar­rest­ing dozens and stop­ping crowds from gath­er­ing for a banned anti-govern­ment march.</p>
    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong riot po­lice pa­trolling the route of a banned anti-govern­ment march ar­rested dozens of peo­ple yes­ter­day, stop­ping crowds from gath­er­ing as Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam hailed the city’s “re­turn to sta­bil­ity” at China’s na­tional day cel­e­bra­tions.</p>
    <p>Po­lice were seen round­ing up more than 50 peo­ple down­town and bind­ing their wrists with plexi-cuffs be­fore putting them on buses. Po­lice said in a Face­book post that they were look­ing for two men who threw petrol bombs to block traffic in another area of the city.</p>
    <p>The pro­test­ers wanted to march against Bei­jing’s im­po­si­tion of a sweep­ing na­tional se­cu­rity law and to de­mand the re­turn of 12 Hong Kong peo­ple ar­rested at sea by the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties as they tried to reach self-ruled Tai­wan. Po­lice had banned the protest, cit­ing coro­n­avirus-re­lated re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Passers-by still broke into prodemoc­racy chants spo­rad­i­cally, but there was no sign of large crowds.</p>
    <p>“It’s China’s na­tional day but this is Hong Kong’s death day,” said Jay, a wo­man dressed in black, the city’s protest at­tire. “We have to try and keep fight­ing for free­dom.”</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cers, in their hun­dreds, con­ducted stop-and-search ac­tiv­i­ties. Among those or­dered to leave were a teenager play­ing protest songs on a wood­wind in­stru­ment, a man dressed in black and hold­ing a yel­low bal­loon – colours as­so­ci­ated with pro-democ­racy sup­port­ers – and a wo­man hold­ing a copy of the Ap­ple Daily anti-govern­ment tabloid.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier in the day, Mrs Lam at­tended a flag rais­ing cer­e­mony with other se­nior Hong Kong and main­land of­fi­cials in an ex­hi­bi­tion cen­tre sur­rounded by po­lice and se­cu­rity bar­ri­ers.</p>
    <p>“Over the past three months, the plain truth is – and it is ob­vi­ous to see – that sta­bil­ity has been re­stored to so­ci­ety while na­tional se­cu­rity has been safe­guarded, and our peo­ple can con­tinue to en­joy their ba­sic rights and free­doms,” Mrs Lam said.</p>
    <p>Late on Wed­nes­day, po­lice said they had ar­rested five peo­ple for in­cit­ing par­tic­i­pa­tion in il­le­gal as­sem­blies on­line.</p>
    <p>Anti-govern­ment protests, which of­ten turned vi­o­lent last year, have been smaller and fewer this year due to coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions on group gath­er­ings and fears of ar­rest un­der the new se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>The law pun­ishes with up to life in pri­son any­thing that China sees as sub­ver­sion, sep­a­ratism, ter­ror­ism and col­lu­sion with for­eign forces.</p>
    <p>Four mem­bers of the League of So­cial Democrats, led by vet­eran ac­tivist “Long Hair” Leung Kwok Hung, marched hold­ing a ban­ner read­ing, “There is no na­tional day cel­e­bra­tion, only na­tional mourn­ing”. Groups of four are the largest al­lowed un­der Covid-19 rules.</p>
    <p>China’s na­tional day is re­sented by many democ­racy sup­port­ers, who say Bei­jing is erod­ing the widerang­ing lib­er­ties the for­mer Bri­tish colony was promised when it re­turned to Chi­nese rule in 1997.</p>
    <p>For pro-Bei­jing sup­port­ers, it is an op­por­tu­nity to drum up pa­tri­o­tism in China’s most restive city.</p>
    <p>At the cer­e­mony, Mrs Lam praised China’s suc­cess in curb­ing the coro­n­avirus out­break and its eco­nomic re­cov­ery, call­ing it “a rare bright spot” which “has shown once again the shift of the global eco­nomic fo­cus from the West to the East.”</p>
    <p>STA­BLE AND SE­CURE</p>
    <p>Over the past three months, the plain truth is – and it is ob­vi­ous to see – that sta­bil­ity has been re­stored to so­ci­ety while na­tional se­cu­rity has been safe­guarded, and our peo­ple can con­tinue to en­joy their ba­sic rights and free­doms.</p>

    <p>FIGHT FOR FREE­DOM CON­TIN­UES</p>
    <p>It’s China’s na­tional day but this is Hong Kong’s death day... We have to try and keep fight­ing for free­dom.</p>
