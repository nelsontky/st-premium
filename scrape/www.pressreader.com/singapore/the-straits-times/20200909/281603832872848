    <p>A fleet of buses and vans have been re­fur­bished for use in trans­port­ing peo­ple who have been ex­posed to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Known as Comet, or Covid-19 Multi-Pas­sen­ger En­hanced Trans­porter ve­hi­cles, they are de­signed to fa­cil­i­tate the trans­fer of pas­sen­gers be­tween fa­cil­i­ties such as hos­pi­tals, dor­mi­to­ries as well as test­ing and com­mu­nity care fa­cil­i­ties, while en­sur­ing the safety of the driv­ers.</p>
    <p>This was part of an ini­tia­tive sup­ported by Te­masek Foun­da­tion in its fight against Covid-19, in col­lab­o­ra­tion with trans­port com­pa­nies SMRT Cor­po­ra­tion, SBS Tran­sit and pri­vate trans­port oper­a­tor Leisure Fron­tier, along with Sin­ga­pore-based en­gi­neer­ing firm Hope Tech­nik and Te­masek-owned firm Sheares Health­care.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, there are 51 Comet ve­hi­cles of vary­ing sizes that are able to ferry pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>The fleet in­cludes “maxi” ve­hi­cles, which are 32-seater and 45-seater coaches, that were first de­ployed in early May and fer­ried an av­er­age of 450 pas­sen­gers a day.</p>
    <p>The fleet was later ex­panded to in­cor­po­rate re­fur­bished 23-seater “midi” ve­hi­cles and nine-seater “minis”, which are smaller in size and bet­ter able to ac­cess var­i­ous pickup and drop-off points such as hos­pi­tals’ ac­ci­dent and emer­gency drive­ways.</p>
    <p>To en­sure the safety of both driv­ers and pas­sen­gers on board, the ve­hi­cle’s in­te­rior is sep­a­rated into two com­part­ments by a sealed divider.</p>
    <p>Both the driver’s and the pas­sen­gers’ com­part­ments have their own air-con­di­tion­ing sys­tem to en­sure that air cir­cu­la­tion is sep­a­rated, pre­vent­ing the driver from com­ing into con­tact with po­ten­tial Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>The rear of the ve­hi­cle, where pas­sen­gers are seated, is also equipped with a neg­a­tive pres­sure sys­tem that has a Hepa fil­ter to clean the air in the com­part­ment be­fore push­ing it out.</p>
