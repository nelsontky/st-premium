    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal (SGH) has cre­ated por­ta­ble sys­tems that can con­vert wards, in­ten­sive care units (ICU) and op­er­at­ing theatres into neg­a­tive pres­sure iso­la­tion rooms within hours to house pa­tients with in­fec­tious dis­eases.</p>
    <p>One of the two trans­par­ent cham­ber-like sys­tems at SGH, called the Sys­tem of Por­ta­ble An­teRoom for Con­tain­ment (SG-Sparc), can be fit­ted be­hind the en­trance of a ward or ICU. It mea­sures 1.2m by 1.6m, and is 2.4m high.</p>
    <p>Af­ter any gaps be­tween the en­trance and the sys­tem are sealed, a Hepa fil­ter unit at the top of the sys­tem is pow­ered up to cre­ate a neg­a­tive pres­sure en­vi­ron­ment within the pa­tient’s room, so that con­tam­i­nated air from the room will not es­cape.</p>
    <p>The cham­ber has two doors, one at the en­trance of the ward and one inside the ward.</p>
    <p>When the inside door opens, con­tam­i­nated air flows into the cham­ber and through the Hepa fil­ter, and clean air re-en­ters the room.</p>
    <p>The 70kg sys­tem takes an hour to set up and was in­stalled at SGH’s Med­i­cal ICU in July.</p>
    <p>The col­lapsi­ble SG-Sparc can also be fixed to sin­gle- and multiple-bed wards.</p>
    <p>The other SG-Sparc sys­tem, used in op­er­at­ing theatres, is larger to al­low an ICU bed, ven­ti­la­tor and med­i­cal staff to pass through. Mea­sur­ing 3.8m by 1.6m and with a height of 2m, the sys­tem pre­vents droplets from es­cap­ing the room while sur­gi­cal op­er­a­tions, in­clud­ing aerosol</p>
    <p>gen­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures, are per­formed on in­fec­tious pa­tients.</p>
    <p>The 150kg cham­ber takes two hours to set up. One sys­tem has been in­stalled in an op­er­at­ing the­atre in SGH.</p>
    <p>The two sys­tems were de­vel­oped by anaes­the­si­ol­o­gists from SGH, in col­lab­o­ra­tion with lo­cal bio­med­i­cal in­cu­ba­tor The Bio­fac­tory. The project was funded by SingHealth Duke-NUS’ Ur­gent Covid-19 Re­search Fund, with con­tri­bu­tion from The Bio­fac­tory.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with ex­ist­ing sys­tems, SG-Sparc has a com­bi­na­tion of ad­vanced fea­tures such as con­tact­less sen­sors and a higher rate of air fil­tra­tion, which makes it the first of its kind, said Dr Mavis Teo, a con­sul­tant at SGH’s de­part­ment of anaes­the­si­ol­ogy.</p>
    <p>In a room fit­ted with the sys­tem, the air can be fil­tered up to 300 times an hour, com­pared with an op­er­at­ing the­atre where the air is fil­tered 12 times an hour.</p>
    <p>The in­ven­tions come at a time when ex­ist­ing num­bers of iso­la­tion rooms abroad are in­suf­fi­cient to sup­port the Covid-19 surge. It is also costly and time-con­sum­ing to build iso­la­tion rooms.</p>
    <p>An SG-Sparc sys­tem costs half as much as ren­o­vat­ing an ICU room to turn it into an iso­la­tion room, said Mr Gabriel Tan, The Bio­fac­tory’s pro­gramme di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>Said Dr Teo, who is the project’s co-in­ves­ti­ga­tor: “We have seen how hos­pi­tals in Italy, in the UK and US – all quite well-de­vel­oped coun­tries – strug­gled when they ran out of neg­a­tive pres­sure iso­la­tion rooms dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>“It got us think­ing if there is a way for us to very quickly and tem­po­rar­ily con­vert ex­ist­ing pa­tient rooms, es­pe­cially ICU rooms, to care for in­fec­tious pa­tients when the need arises,” she added.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said SG-Sparc has re­ceived strong in­ter­est from lo­cal and over­seas hos­pi­tals.</p>
