    <p>Soon after I moved to Sin­ga­pore in 2007, I be­came preg­nant with my sec­ond daugh­ter Bee. When my new friend Rose learnt of this, she ex­claimed: “You’re quite lucky. You can send her to an in­ter­na­tional school. We Sin­ga­pore­ans have to cope with the PSLE for our chil­dren.”</p>
    <p>A few weeks later, when my hus­band Jim con­cluded a speech for a fi­nan­cial ser­vices com­pany here, a woman in the au­di­ence asked: “Mr Rogers, do you re­ally know what you’re do­ing? Many of us dream of es­cap­ing the in­tense lo­cal ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem, es­pe­cially the PSLE, while your fam­ily is work­ing ac­tively to en­ter it.”</p>
    <p>Then she hes­i­tated, before adding: “We all think you’re mad.”</p>
    <p>On both oc­ca­sions, I was be­wil­dered. The PSLE or Primary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tion – a test so in­tense and rig­or­ous some par­ents take sab­bat­i­cals from jobs to “coach” and “be there” for their chil­dren dur­ing the months lead­ing up to it. A test that has eight out of 10 house­holds send­ing their chil­dren for tu­ition. A test both tweens and par­ents dread and fear.</p>
    <p>Not be­liev­ing for a sec­ond that the pres­sure could be as in­tense as fore­warned, I be­came a par­ent vol­un­teer and moved within 1km of Nanyang Primary School for my daugh­ter Happy, now 17, to en­ter the school.</p>
    <p>In 2010, as a per­ma­nent res­i­dent (PR), Happy could gain en­try, but re­quire­ments have now changed, of­fer­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans ab­so­lute rights over PRs when ap­ply­ing to lo­cal schools.</p>
    <p>Some­how, Happy, like the other 39,000 chil­dren tak­ing the PSLE in 2015, sur­vived. Years later, I clearly re­call when she and her class­mates re­ceived their T-scores. All of them sat un­easily at their desks, as tense par­ents waited in the door­way.</p>
    <p>As each stu­dent ap­proached the teacher’s desk, all paused – some longer than oth­ers – before un­seal­ing the en­ve­lope con­tain­ing that mon­u­men­tal score. We par­ents, fan­ning our­selves on that scorch­ing day, im­me­di­ately knew, from their eu­phoric or de­feated ex­pres­sions, whether each child had met ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>Although most of Happy’s class­mates did well, one, J, missed the score to en­ter her choice school by a sin­gle point. As her face con­torted while she strug­gled not to cry, J’s par­ents and the teacher con­soled her, while all oth­ers looked to the floor, not want­ing to am­plify her mis­er­able state.</p>
    <p>J, by the way, would end up thriv­ing at her third-choice school, as did Happy, who found her way to Nanyang Girls’ High.</p>
    <p>Now, Happy’s sis­ter Bee faces the be­gin­ning of the PSLE, with oral ex­am­i­na­tions in 11 days. Along with her co­hort, she is in the last batch of chil­dren who will re­ceive T-scores, since the Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry has de­ter­mined that a broader grade range will be bet­ter for the chil­dren. Thus, a one-point dif­fer­ence will no longer keep a child out of a school.</p>
    <p>As a mother, I am hope­ful the new scor­ing for the PSLE, a rung on life’s lad­der for ev­ery Sin­ga­porean, will im­prove our chil­dren’s hap­pi­ness quo­tient ex­po­nen­tially, but I am not con­vinced.</p>
    <p>After sur­viv­ing the Covid-19 cir­cuit breaker, and presently liv­ing with the on­go­ing threat of the pan­demic, many of us have ex­pe­ri­enced a hard re­set on what we value in life. This ap­pears an ideal op­por­tu­nity for us to re­con­sider what we want ed­u­ca­tion to achieve for our chil­dren, and what their child­hoods should en­com­pass.</p>
    <p>For decades, we have be­lieved the class­room to be the op­ti­mal space for learn­ing. Yet, after ex­pe­ri­enc­ing home-based learn­ing for an ex­tended pe­riod, we now know learn­ing at home worked splen­didly for many stu­dents. It al­lowed them to learn at their own pace and ask ques­tions pri­vately, while en­cour­ag­ing in­de­pen­dent learn­ing.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, since 1960, we have looked to the PSLE to steer our chil­dren to the right sec­ondary schools. But are stan­dard­ised tests the best prepa­ra­tion for the world our chil­dren are in­her­it­ing?</p>
    <p>With chil­dren who have ben­e­fited from the pub­lic ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem, I do not want to sound un­grate­ful. Since I ap­pre­ci­ate rigour, I ap­plaud my daugh­ters learn­ing at a higher level than their peers in the United States.</p>
    <p>Yet, something feels out of whack when our chil­dren have busier cal­en­dars than many par­ents, what with the com­bi­na­tion of school, tu­ition and ex­tra ac­tiv­i­ties. By age 10 or 11, many leave home by 6.30am, re­turn around 4pm, then head to tu­ition classes un­til din­ner, with a pile of home­work await­ing them before bed. Our chil­dren are rightly tired.</p>
    <p>I do get it: Sin­ga­pore is a mer­i­toc­racy. PSLE serves as an equaliser, stream­ing chil­dren to the cor­rect schools, al­low­ing each one to ex­cel at the right place for him or her. Although I have no panacea or quick fix, I firmly be­lieve as a so­ci­ety, we need a wider view of what suc­cess means in our chil­dren’s lives.</p>
    <p>At present, if they do not gain ac­cess to a sec­ondary school via Di­rect School Ad­mis­sion for a tal­ent, sport or spe­cific aca­demic sub­ject, then the only mark used to define their abil­ity is the PSLE score. This can­not re­flect the true ethos of our 12-year-olds.</p>
    <p>We need to ex­pand the cri­te­ria by which we judge chil­dren. Grades from primary school could serve as an in­di­ca­tor of a child’s fu­ture per­for­mance. Con­sid­er­ing those grades, as well as other achieve­ments both in and out of the class­room, along­side the PSLE, would give ed­u­ca­tors a more holis­tic rep­re­sen­ta­tion of the po­ten­tial of our stu­dents bound for sec­ondary schools.</p>
    <p>In their life­times, our chil­dren will be re­quired to in­crease and ex­pand their knowl­edge reg­u­larly to re­main rel­e­vant. No longer will most of their lives centre on a sin­gle ca­reer track. They will ob­tain and cre­ate jobs that do not even ex­ist to­day.</p>
    <p>They ought to be re­source­ful and savvy at adapt­ing, while cop­ing in an ever-chang­ing world, which will be their only con­stant. A pas­sion to ques­tion, prob­lem-solve and think unconventi­onally will lead them to be ful­filled, so they may thrive in life, not only on ex­ams.</p>
    <p>As a child, Dr An­gela Duck­worth was told she was not par­tic­u­larly smart, yet at age 43, she re­ceived the pres­ti­gious MacArthur</p>
    <p>“Ge­nius” Fel­low­ship. In her New York Times best­seller, Grit: The Power Of Pas­sion And Per­se­ver­ance, she ad­vises that hard work and ef­fort out­per­form nat­u­ral abil­ity in many cases.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, we might be wise to al­ter our per­sis­tent praise of grades as brains, and start to glo­rify de­ter­mi­na­tion and re­silience all the more.</p>
    <p>As a Tiger Mum who pushes my daugh­ters, ex­pect­ing them to ex­cel aca­dem­i­cally, I know first-hand how dif­fi­cult it is to mod­ify a mind­set. The truth is we all un­der­stand grades do not make a per­son. None­the­less, we con­tinue to ap­ply in­tense pres­sure upon our chil­dren.</p>
    <p>We do this be­cause we want what is best for them: to test well, pro­ceed to a good school, then uni­ver­sity, gain a good job and, ul­ti­mately, pros­per in life. It is never that sim­ple and, of­ten, this sce­nario does not breed con­tent­ment. Nor is it a proven recipe for suc­cess. Of the chief ex­ec­u­tives of the Top 10 com­pa­nies in the For­tune 100, only Jeff Be­zos of Ama­zon at­tended an Ivy League school.</p>
    <p>For Bee, I have en­cour­aged her to work dili­gently, so she will have no re­grets, no mat­ter her score. Will I be sad if she does not get into her top school? Yes. Will I scold her? No. Will I love her any less? No.</p>
    <p>Will we deal with the fall­out of a lower-than-de­sired score? Yes.</p>
    <p>More than any­thing, we should de­sire peak men­tal health for our chil­dren, mean­ing we not only need to man­age their ex­pec­ta­tions for the PSLE, but also our own.</p>
    <p>Our chil­dren are a dif­fer­ent breed from our ilk, fac­ing an un­cer­tain fu­ture. Learn­ing can be their le­git­i­mate su­per­power. If we do not pass a love of learn­ing on to them, then we have failed our chil­dren, even if they ace the PSLE.</p>
