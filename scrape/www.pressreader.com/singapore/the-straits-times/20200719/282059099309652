    <p>LON­DON • Tot­ten­ham Hot­spur man­ager Jose Mour­inho be­lieves Europa League qual­i­fi­ca­tion is the least the club de­serve af­ter com­ing through a dif­fi­cult cam­paign, but said the play­ers at his dis­posal are of Cham­pi­ons League level.</p>
    <p>Tot­ten­ham were 14th in the Premier League stand­ings when he took charge of the north Lon­don club last Novem­ber, and have climbed up to sev­enth with two games re­main­ing.</p>
    <p>Only cham­pi­ons Liver­pool, Manch­ester City and the in-form Manch­ester United have recorded more points than Spurs since Mour­inho’s ar­rival, de­spite los­ing his key play­ers to in­juries.</p>
    <p>“I think Spurs would be even bet­ter than that with­out all the prob­lems that we had,” he said ahead of to­day’s home clash against fourth­placed Le­ices­ter City.</p>
    <p>“No other team had even sim­i­lar prob­lems. The fact that we are fourth (in the form ta­ble) since my ar­rival, with­out (Hugo) Lloris, Harry Kane, (Moussa) Sis­soko and</p>
    <p>Son (He­ung-min), is a good re­flec­tion of the po­ten­tial we have.</p>
    <p>“The min­i­mum we de­serve is to fin­ish in a po­si­tion that keeps us in Euro­pean foot­ball, a com­pe­ti­tion that is not our level. We are bet­ter than that. We need to win these two matches now.”</p>
    <p>Vic­tory against Le­ices­ter and Crys­tal Palace on the fi­nal day of the sea­son will guar­an­tee Spurs at least a sev­enth-placed fin­ish as well as a Europa League spot, as long as ninth-placed Arse­nal fail to win the FA Cup.</p>
    <p>Mour­inho, 57, said he is mo­ti­vat­ing his play­ers to win the fi­nal two games with the talk of win­ning the Europa League next year.</p>
    <p>“In quite a funny way I’m telling the play­ers, two more vic­to­ries to win the Europa League,” said the Por­tuguese, who won the com­pe­ti­tion with United in 2017.</p>
    <p>“I know it’s not like that, I know the Europa League is a long com­pe­ti­tion and has some good teams. Some teams go from Cham­pi­ons League to Europa League in the knock­out phase and (that) makes it a re­ally dif­fi­cult com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>“It’s just a feel­ing to try to mo­ti­vate the boys be­cause our level is Cham­pi­ons League. The play­ers played in the Cham­pi­ons League fi­nal (last year).”</p>
    <p>Jan Ver­tonghen could be set to play his fi­nal home game at the club as he is out of con­tract at the end of the sea­son and there is no sign of a new deal.</p>
    <p>Mour­inho said Dele Alli will miss the match with his ham­string in­jury while the club will again al­low Serge Au­rier to de­cide whether he is in­volved. The right­back played in the 3-1 win at New­cas­tle on Wed­nes­day just 48 hours af­ter his brother was killed, but he is cur­rently in France with fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Le­ices­ter will be with­out a few in­jured first-team play­ers amid their Cham­pi­ons League push for a top­four fin­ish. Man­ager Bren­dan Rodgers said James Mad­di­son, Ben Chilwell and Chris­tian Fuchs will be out for the rest of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>Rodgers added: “We all sat down at the start of sea­son and said it would be huge chal­lenge for Le­ices­ter to get into Europe. To do it in my first sea­son here is a phe­nom­e­nal achieve­ment.”</p>
