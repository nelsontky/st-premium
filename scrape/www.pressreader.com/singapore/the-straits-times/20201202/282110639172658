    <p>For a long time, the job of supporting young ones with spe­cial needs has been left to staff trained in early in­ter­ven­tion, as most preschool teach­ers do not know how to help th­ese chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Hence, par­ents of kids with spe­cial needs would be fa­mil­iar with the daily shuf­fle be­tween preschools and cen­tres which pro­vide early in­ter­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>Phi­lan­thropic group Lien Foun­da­tion wants to change this, by bring­ing both worlds to­gether.</p>
    <p>It is fund­ing a three-year pi­lot pro­gramme, called Mak­ing Every Pre-school In­clu­sive (Mepi), in a bid to bridge the pre-school and early in­ter­ven­tion sec­tors.</p>
    <p>The pi­lot, which started in July last year, in­volves train­ing ed­u­ca­tors at St James’ Church Kinder­garten (SJCK) to work with early in­ter­ven­tion­ists from Rain­bow Cen­tre to meet chil­dren’s di­verse needs in a main­stream set­ting.</p>
    <p>This is the lat­est ef­fort by Lien Foun­da­tion in de­vel­op­ing mod­els of in­clu­sive ed­u­ca­tion. It had ear­lier set up Kin­dle Gar­den, Sin­ga­pore’s first in­clu­sive pre-school.</p>
    <p>The Mepi ini­tia­tive will be ex­tended to two PAP Com­mu­nity Foun­da­tion (PCF) pre-schools next year, with pos­si­bly two more later. For a start, four early in­ter­ven­tion staff, 26 PCF teach­ers and 15 chil­dren with di­ag­nosed needs will be in­volved.</p>
    <p>As part of the pi­lot, two early in­ter­ven­tion­ists from Rain­bow Cen­tre are based at SJCK’s Hard­ing cam­pus in Dempsey four days a week, where they teach along­side the pre-school teach­ers.</p>
    <p>Lessons are co-planned and re­viewed fort­nightly. The team also de­signs ac­tiv­i­ties that all chil­dren in a class can take part in, as well as</p>
    <p>more cus­tomised sup­port those with needs like autism.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral of the six chil­dren with such needs in SJCK also re­ceive sup­port at Rain­bow Cen­tre, which of­fers early in­ter­ven­tion for those aged six and be­low.</p>
    <p>So far, 18 SJCK teach­ers have re­ceived train­ing and the aim is to get more on board next year.</p>
    <p>for</p>
    <p>Dr Jac­que­line Chung, aca­demic di­rec­tor of St James’ Pre-school Ser­vices which runs SJCK, said the hope is that through reg­u­lar in­ter­ac­tion, pre-school teach­ers will be more equipped to han­dle chil­dren with spe­cial needs.</p>
    <p>For a long time, the early child­hood and early in­ter­ven­tion worlds ex­isted sep­a­rately, she said. “When­ever in the past there were is­sues with chil­dren, we would then lit­er­ally say, you get help over that side, be­cause we do not know what to do, and we can help only up to a cer­tain ex­tent.”</p>
    <p>Two trips to Fin­land and Bri­tish Columbia in Canada with the Lien Foun­da­tion in the past two years changed her per­cep­tion.</p>
    <p>Dr Chung and Ms Tan Sze Wee, Rain­bow Cen­tre’s ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor, had taken the trips to see how schools in those coun­tries carry out in­clu­sive ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Dr Chung said they saw how early in­ter­ven­tion and main­stream school could work to­gether. “The in­ter­sec­tion (of the two worlds) is just a mir­ror of what a healthy so­ci­ety should look like. And it should hap­pen as early as pos­si­ble... be­cause that’s when at­ti­tudes, value dis­po­si­tions, be­liefs are shaped,” she added.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is be­gin­ning to pay more at­ten­tion to in­clu­sive ed­u­ca­tion. Last year, the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment set up a work­group to ex­plore how to in­te­grate chil­dren with spe­cial needs in reg­u­lar pre-schools.</p>
    <p>It in­tro­duced a pro­gramme, which en­ables suitable chil­dren with mild to mod­er­ate de­vel­op­men­tal needs to get sup­port at a main­stream pre-school.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan said par­ents are see­ing the ben­e­fits of plac­ing their chil­dren with spe­cial needs in main­stream pre-schools.</p>
    <p>Dr Chung said SJCK had en­rolled chil­dren with spe­cial needs be­fore, but most teach­ers felt in­ad­e­quately trained to help them.</p>
    <p>Now, the co-plan­ning of lessons helps pre-school teach­ers ap­ply early in­ter­ven­tion strate­gies to en­gage dif­fer­ent types of learn­ers, in­stead of re­sort­ing to guess­work as to what works, she added.</p>
    <p>The Mepi team plans to de­velop a train­ing man­ual and course to guide sim­i­lar part­ner­ships be­tween early in­ter­ven­tion cen­tres and pre-schools.</p>
    <p>Lien Foun­da­tion chief ex­ec­u­tive Lee Poh Wah said: “Mepi has demon­strated that teach­ers, early in­ter­ven­tion­ists, ther­a­pists and par­ents can learn to work to­gether for im­proved chil­dren, teacher and fam­ily out­comes.</p>
    <p>“We have bridged ‘main­stream’ and ‘spe­cial’ ed­u­ca­tion to broaden the reper­toire of skills, prac­tices and ca­pa­bil­i­ties in schools to deal with di­ver­sity more ef­fec­tively.”</p>
    <p>Much has been done by the Gov­ern­ment and com­mu­nity to sup­port in­clu­sive ed­u­ca­tion in the early child­hood sys­tem, he noted, and the pri­mary school sys­tem can build on th­ese ef­forts fur­ther.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan said teach­ing norms should change to meet the needs of more di­verse learn­ers, whether or not they have di­ag­nosed needs.</p>
    <p>“Maybe as an early child­hood ed­u­ca­tor, (you think) it should be nor­mal to ac­cept that all chil­dren sit down and at­tend lessons,” she said. “We are hop­ing to stretch that, and chal­lenge that ac­tu­ally it is the norm for our kids to be run­ning around, but it is nor­mal for ed­u­ca­tors to be learn­ing how to en­gage every type of learner.”</p>
