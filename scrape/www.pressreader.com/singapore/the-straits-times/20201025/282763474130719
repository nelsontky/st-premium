    <p>March 21 - April 19</p>
    <p>You reap what you sow and the world can now see what you have sown. If you have been good, it is sure to be a ter­rific day. If you have ne­glected your karma, ex­pect speed bumps.</p>
    <p>April 20 - May 20</p>
    <p>You and a friend are think­ing along the same lines, so keep push­ing to­wards the next big project you can work on to­gether. It may be work-re­lated, to­tally fun or some­where in be­tween.</p>
    <p>May 21 - June 20</p>
    <p>Some­thing small starts to build and it is af­fect­ing your pub­lic image more than you would have ex­pected. That could be good or bad, so watch closely and fix things if they start to get weird.</p>
    <p>June 21 - July 22</p>
    <p>Your abil­ity to con­nect with oth­ers is quite strong, so reach out to that es­tranged fam­ily mem­ber or crush in your life. It is a great time to show you un­der­stand him or her deeply.</p>
    <p>July 23 - Aug 22</p>
    <p>Peo­ple are freak­ing out, thanks to a bit of news you do not think is all that im­por­tant. That does not give you li­cence to dis­miss their con­cerns. In­stead, you can try to bring them back from the brink.</p>
    <p>Aug 23 - Sept 22</p>
    <p>You should let go of small-scale projects – the de­tails start to blend to­gether un­til you can­not make head or tail of them. Just re­lax and try to get into the spirit of the big pic­ture.</p>
    <p>Sept 23 - Oct 22</p>
    <p>If things are not go­ing your way, try to take a step back from the ac­tion and en­joy life’s lit­tle plea­sures. Your abil­ity to recharge your bat­ter­ies is es­sen­tial, so make the most of it.</p>
    <p>Oct 23 - Nov 21</p>
    <p>You feel younger and more play­ful, so have fun with what­ever comes your way. It is a good time for skip­ping work or school and see­ing what the world holds for you, so go for it.</p>
    <p>Nov 22 - Dec 21</p>
    <p>Think more care­fully about what is needed – you may be able to get away with some pretty wild ideas if you are smart about it. It is one of those days when pos­si­bil­i­ties are lim­it­less.</p>
    <p>Dec 22 - Jan 19</p>
    <p>Some­one close needs your help and you should find it eas­ier than usual to come to the res­cue. In fact, you may stick around af­ter the cri­sis is over and help him get back on his feet.</p>
    <p>Jan 20 - Feb 18</p>
    <p>Shar­ing is car­ing. You should find it eas­ier to deal with projects or plans that are col­lab­o­ra­tive. See if you can grab a friend or col­league to make even faster progress be­fore the day is out.</p>
    <p>Feb 19 - March 20</p>
    <p>Reach out to some­one new – you have to make new con­nec­tions and it is eas­ier than ever for you to do so. Head out to the park or beach, or dive into an on­line com­mu­nity.</p>
