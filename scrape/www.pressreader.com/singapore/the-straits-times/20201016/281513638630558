    <p>Even as the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in Sin­ga­pore sta­bilises and the coun­try shifts its fo­cus to eco­nomic re­cov­ery, it needs to stay open and con­nected to the world, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Man­ag­ing the coun­try’s dual iden­tity – as both city and nation – is crit­i­cal to Sin­ga­pore’s suc­cess, he added.</p>
    <p>As a city, it must re­main open to new and ex­cit­ing ideas.</p>
    <p>As a nation, it has to stay united and de­fend its in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>“These seem­ingly con­flict­ing ob­jec­tives are not choices, but ne­ces­si­ties for us,” Mr Heng said, round­ing up two days of de­bate on the Third Sup­ple­men­tary Sup­ply and Bud­get Ad­just­ments Bill, dur­ing which 33 MPs spoke. “And they will al­ways de­fine us as a coun­try, and guide how we man­age our econ­omy and so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>In his speech, Mr Heng re­capped plans to re­ju­ve­nate the econ­omy and spoke of how Sin­ga­pore will shift its ap­proach from broad-based help to more tar­geted sup­port to help firms and work­ers stave off the worst ef­fects of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He also ad­dressed Sin­ga­pore’s fis­cal out­look, not­ing that the coun­try’s medium-term rev­enues are ex­pected to be sub­dued and un­cer­tain, and out­lin­ing plans to en­sure the coun­try’s fi­nan­cial se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>As a city, Sin­ga­pore’s global com­pe­ti­tion in­cludes cities such as London, New York, Shang­hai and Mum­bai, said Mr Heng, who is also Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies and Min­is­ter for Fi­nance.</p>
    <p>All these cities have their own hin­ter­lands and can draw ta­lent from large na­tional pools.</p>
    <p>But Sin­ga­pore, with its small do­mes­tic pop­u­la­tion of four mil­lion, has to as­sem­ble the “best pos­si­ble team” to stay use­ful and rel­e­vant to the world.</p>
    <p>“We want to make sure that we have the best play­ers in our team, play­ing to one another’s strengths, work­ing to­gether as a team,” Mr Heng said. “This is why we must re­main open to the best tal­ents from all over the world. So that we can put forth the best team and step out onto the world stage.”</p>
    <p>Giv­ing ex­am­ples of how open­ness has ben­e­fited Sin­ga­pore, he noted that global com­pa­nies have set up op­er­a­tions here, bring­ing their know-how and net­works, cre­at­ing a vi­brant ecosys­tem for lo­cal com­pa­nies and start-ups and en­abling them to be part of a global value chain.</p>
    <p>Top ta­lent has also cho­sen to call Sin­ga­pore home and al­lowed lo­cals to col­lab­o­rate with the best. For ex­am­ple, Sir David Lane and his wife, Pro­fes­sor Bir­gitte Lane, have pro­vided thought lead­er­ship that has spurred Sin­ga­pore’s ad­vance­ments in the bio­med­i­cal sciences, he said.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the coun­try sends its top minds over­seas to learn from oth­ers, through schol­ar­ship pro­grammes such as that of­fered by the Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search.</p>
    <p>At the same time, Sin­ga­pore is mak­ing ev­ery ef­fort to help its work­ers up­skill and reskill, Mr Heng said. The fu­ture of work may be very dif­fer­ent in a post-coro­n­avirus world, he said, and the rise of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and the gig econ­omy will make the job market more volatile.</p>
    <p>“The new econ­omy will re­quire work­ers who are ver­sa­tile and know how to build on ex­ist­ing skills, em­brace life­long learn­ing, and be able to move be­tween ad­ja­cent in­dus­try clus­ters,” he added, call­ing on com­pa­nies to play their part in de­vel­op­ing train­ing pro­grammes for work­ers.</p>
    <p>These ef­forts to up­skill the Sin­ga­porean work­force, cou­pled with its open­ness to ideas, in­no­va­tions and in­no­va­tors, will help se­cure a bet­ter fu­ture for this coun­try, Mr Heng said. “As a global city com­pet­ing and col­lab­o­rat­ing with other global cities, it is cru­cial that we re­main open, and at the same time, in­vest in our peo­ple,” he added. “That way, we re­main rel­e­vant and use­ful to the world.”</p>
