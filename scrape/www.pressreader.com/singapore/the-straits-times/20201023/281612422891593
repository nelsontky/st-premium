    <p>The Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and De­vel­op­ment (OECD) de­cided to test 15-year-old stu­dents on their global com­pe­tency in the lat­est Pro­gramme for In­ter­na­tional Stu­dent Assess­ment (Pisa).</p>
    <p>It said such com­pe­tence is a press­ing ne­ces­sity, with schools “cen­tral” to the teach­ing of global com­pe­tency skills.</p>
    <p>HOW IS GLOBAL COM­PE­TENCE DE­FINED?</p>
    <p>The Pisa testers de­fined global com­pe­tence as ca­pac­ity to ex­am­ine lo­cal, global and in­ter­cul­tural is­sues, un­der­stand and ap­pre­ci­ate dif­fer­ent per­spec­tives and world views, in­ter­act suc­cess­fully and re­spect­fully with oth­ers, and take re­spon­si­ble ac­tion to­wards sus­tain­abil­ity and col­lec­tive well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>HOW WERE STU­DENTS AS­SESSED?</p>
    <p>The assess­ment came in two parts.</p>
    <p>A cog­ni­tive test as­sessed stu­dents on their knowl­edge of is­sues of lo­cal and global sig­nif­i­cance, in­clud­ing pub­lic health, eco­nomic and en­vi­ron­men­tal is­sues, as well as their in­ter­cul­tural knowl­edge, skills and at­ti­tudes.</p>
    <p>In the sec­ond back­ground ques­tion­naire part, stu­dents were asked to re­port their fa­mil­iar­ity with global is­sues; how de­vel­oped their lin­guis­tic and com­mu­ni­ca­tion skills are; to what ex­tent they hold cer­tain at­ti­tudes, such as re­spect for peo­ple from dif­fer­ent cul­tural back­grounds; and what op­por­tu­ni­ties they have at school to de­velop global com­pe­tence.</p>
    <p>HOW MANY TOOK THE TEST?</p>
    <p>About 250,000 15-year-olds in 27 coun­tries and economies, in­clud­ing more than 6,000 Sin­ga­pore stu­dents, sat the test and com­pleted the sur­vey ques­tion­naire.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents in an­other 39 coun­tries and economies com­pleted only the ques­tion­naire and did not take part in the test.</p>
