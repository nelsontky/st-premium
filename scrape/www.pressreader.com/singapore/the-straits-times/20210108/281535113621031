    <p>The num­ber of Hous­ing Board (HDB) re­sale flats sold for at least $1 mil­lion hit a new high last year, with 82 mil­lion-dol­lar flats trans­acted. Ten such deals took place last month, the sixth con­sec­u­tive month of ris­ing re­sale prices. The strong show­ing by the mar­ket came de­spite the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of Hous­ing Board (HDB) re­sale flats sold for at least $1 mil­lion hit a new high last year amid a strong show­ing by the mar­ket de­spite the Covid-19 pan­demic, ac­cord­ing to flash data from real es­tate por­tal SRX re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>There were 82 mil­lion-dol­lar flats trans­acted last year, com­pared with 64 for 2019, af­ter last month saw 10 more of such trans­ac­tions. They make up about 0.35 per cent of the to­tal num­ber of HDB re­sale flats sold last year.</p>
    <p>Re­sale prices also rose for the sixth con­sec­u­tive month last month, bring­ing the to­tal price rise for last year to 6.4 per cent, much more than the 0.3 per cent in­crease in 2019.</p>
    <p>ERA Re­alty head of re­search and con­sul­tancy Ni­cholas Mak said: “The per­for­mance of the HDB re­sale prices and trans­ac­tion vol­ume il­lus­trates that the ad­verse im­pact of Covid-19 and eco­nomic re­ces­sion is like water off a duck’s back.”</p>
    <p>HDB flash es­ti­mates re­leased ear­lier showed that re­sale prices rose 2.9 per cent in the fourth quar­ter of last year, mark­ing the big­gest quar­terly in­crease in more than nine years. For the whole year, re­sale prices rose 4.8 per cent.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Mak: “The re­sale trans­ac­tions of HDB flats that re­cently com­pleted the five-year min­i­mum oc­cu­pa­tion period con­tinue to ex­ert their in­flu­ence on the HDB price in­dex. Th­ese newer flats are usu­ally sold at higher prices than older flats in the same vicin­ity.”</p>
    <p>Some of the lo­ca­tions with new re­sale flats that were trans­acted at higher prices are in Daw­son, Pung­gol and Boon Tiong Road, he said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, SRX es­ti­mated that monthly sales hit 2,489 units last month. This was the sev­enth straight month where re­sale flat trans­ac­tions sur­passed the 2,000-unit mark, mit­i­gat­ing the sharp drop in sales in April and May dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>The string of strong monthly sales took the to­tal re­sale flat vol­ume to 23,427 units for the whole of last year, and this is 4.3 per cent higher than in 2019.</p>
    <p>Mr Mak said the pan­demic may have fu­elled that ex­pan­sion of the HDB re­sale mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore Covid-19... ap­pli­cants for HDB Build-To-Order (BTO) flats may have had to wait about three years to get the keys to their new flats. The pan­demic led to bot­tle­necks and de­lays in the con­struc­tion of many public hous­ing projects. As a re­sult, some po­ten­tial HDB BTO ap­pli­cants are turn­ing to the re­sale mar­ket for their home pur­chases.”</p>
    <p>Mr Mak added that De­cem­ber is also usu­ally a lull period in the property mar­ket, but the travel re­stric­tions that kept many at home meant that the HDB re­sale mar­ket con­tin­ued to op­er­ate as nor­mal.</p>
    <p>Orange­Tee & Tie head of re­search and con­sul­tancy Chris­tine Sun said that the un­ex­pected hous­ing boom is also likely to be “fu­elled by the record-low mort­gage rates, huge fis­cal stim­u­lus pro­grammes de­signed to fend off an eco­nomic dis­as­ter and the slew of pol­icy changes made to im­prove HDB mar­ket con­di­tions over the past two years”.</p>
    <p>PropNex head of re­search and con­tent Wong Siew Ying said: “Our mar­ket ob­ser­va­tions sug­gest that buy­ing in­ter­est re­mains keen, and the re­bound in sales in re­cent months has prompted some sell­ers to in­crease their ask­ing price.</p>
    <p>“Stiff com­pe­ti­tion for choice flats also saw buy­ers of­fer­ing a higher price in order to se­cure the unit.”</p>
    <p>Ar­eas like Bis­han Street 24 and Daw­son Road saw some of the mil­lion-dol­lar HDB re­sale trans­ac­tions last month. The high­est trans­acted price for a re­sale flat last month was achieved at $1,218,888 by a five­room De­sign, Build and Sell Scheme unit at Natura Loft in Bis­han.</p>
    <p>The HDB re­sale mar­ket is likely to stay strong this year, ex­perts said.</p>
    <p>Ms Sun said: “We may ex­pect de­mand for HDB re­sale mar­ket to con­tinue to do well this year. We an­tic­i­pate that the prices of re­sale flats may rise by a fur­ther 2 per cent to 5 per cent.”</p>
    <p>Re­sale vol­ume may also in­crease by another 3 per cent to 5 per cent to around 24,000 to 26,000 units for the whole of this year, she said.</p>
