    <p>Get­ting by dur­ing the Covid-19 pe­riod as an un­em­ployed sin­gle mum was al­ready tax­ing for Ms Nur Hu­maiza, and she was dealt an­other blow when she and her son had to serve a 14-day quar­an­tine or­der.</p>
    <p>Her seven-year-old had spent time with his fa­ther about a week be­fore he tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>As a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure, she and her child had to be quar­an­tined in their one-room rental flat in Jurong West.</p>
    <p>“I felt help­less when I heard the news be­cause there was no one to get food for us, and we felt re­ally lonely as we fre­quently stayed over at my sis­ter’s house,” she said.</p>
    <p>Within a day, a so­cial worker help­ing Ms Hu­maiza li­aised with other or­gan­i­sa­tions to de­liver 50 packs of cooked meals and household items to her home.</p>
    <p>For a few years now, fi­nan­cial aid has been cov­er­ing her rent and util­ity bills, and she re­ceives $750 a month from ComCare. She has not worked since her son was born.</p>
    <p>Her fam­ily was among 101 fam­i­lies who re­ceived $110 worth of gro­ceries and $40 FairPrice vouch­ers from so­cial ser­vice or­gan­i­sa­tion Civil­ians As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (CAS) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Most of the re­cip­i­ents are sin­gle­par­ent fam­i­lies liv­ing in Jurong, and more fam­i­lies in the area and other places will re­ceive the gro­cery packs in the com­ing weeks.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive was cre­ated mainly to sup­port sin­gle par­ents strug­gling dur­ing the Covid-19 pe­riod.</p>
    <p>CAS mem­bers and the pub­lic con­trib­uted to an on­line fund-raiser for this ini­tia­tive, and more than $23,000 has been raised, said CAS pres­i­dent M.P. Sel­lvem.</p>
    <p>Ms Hu­maiza said the gro­ceries will tide her over the next month while she fo­cuses on her son’s med­i­cal ex­penses. A fifth of her $750 al­lowance goes to buy­ing two cans of milk pow­der for her son, who needs the im­mu­nity boost as he has asthma, eczema and bron­chi­tis.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam, the or­gan­i­sa­tion’s pa­tron and the MP for Ta­man Jurong ward, dropped by Ta­man Jurong Com­mu­nity Club yes­ter­day morn­ing with his wife to greet the vol­un­teers who packed the gro­ceries.</p>
    <p>CAS started as a club in the Pub­lic Works Depart­ment (PWD) quar</p>
    <p>ters in Up­per Bukit Timah in 1964.</p>
    <p>Then known as the Hillview Civil­ians Sports Club, it was formed to keep young peo­ple in the neigh­bour­hood away from so­cial ills and get them in­volved in sports and other so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties. The club has since evolved into a reg­is­tered char­ity that sup­ports mainly sin­gle par­ents, se­niors and young peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to the me­dia, Mr Thar­man em­pha­sised the or­gan­i­sa­tion’s his­tory.</p>
    <p>He said “gang­ster­ism and all kinds of prob­lems were rife in the area”. The club or­gan­ised ac­tiv­i­ties such as foot­ball for young peo­ple and this helped them stay away from bad in­flu­ences and be­come suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>PWD work­ers, who lived in such quar­ters with their fam­i­lies, were in­volved in build­ing and main­tain­ing in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
