    <p>It was a star-stud­ded Chi­nese Valen­tine’s Day at Tai­wanese tele­vi­sion per­son­al­ity Ja­son Tang’s house on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>In pho­tos shared by Tang’s long-time friend and fel­low TV host Blackie Chen, Tai­wanese ac­tor Wal­lace Huo and Hong Kong ac­tor Shawn Yue were seen cel­e­brat­ing the oc­ca­sion at Tang’s place with a bar­be­cue din­ner.</p>
    <p>In a clip on In­sta­gram, Chen, 43, showed his as­sis­tant tak­ing pho­tos with Love In A Puff (2010) star Yue, 38, and The Jour­ney Of Flower (2015) lead­ing man Huo, 40. He joked that the three looked like the pop­u­lar 1980s’ boy band Lit­tle Tigers.</p>
    <p>He also posted a group photo of the men on an out­door porch swing.</p>
    <p>The stars are all mar­ried with chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Yue has a two-year-old son with model Sarah Wang and is cur­rently ex­pect­ing a daugh­ter. Huo mar­ried ac­tress Ruby Lin, 44, in 2016 and they have a three-yearold daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>Chen is mar­ried to singer Chris­tine Fan, 44, and the two have twin boys born in 2015; while Tang, 41, has two daugh­ters and a son.</p>
    <p>While none of the fa­mous wives made an ap­pear­ance in the pho­tos shared by Chen, Lin was seen in a pic­ture of the gath­er­ing shared by Tang’s mother, vet­eran Tai­wanese ac­tress Han Hsiang-chin.</p>
    <p>Han, who was starstruck by the hand­some lead­ing men at her son’s home party, wrote on her Weibo pro­file: “I couldn’t stop tak­ing pho­tos. What a won­der­ful Valen­tine’s Day.”</p>
    <p>The stars seem to hang out to­gether of­ten. Huo, Yue, Chen, Tang and Tai­wanese model Sunny Wang were re­cently spot­ted play­ing bas­ket­ball to­gether by Tai­wanese news out­let Ap­ple Daily.</p>
