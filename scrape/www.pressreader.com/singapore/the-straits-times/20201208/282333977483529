    <p>MANAMA • Ser­gio Perez be­came the first Mex­i­can For­mula One race win­ner in 50 years on Sun­day and he barely dared to be­lieve it, de­mand­ing a pinch to prove it was not just a dream.</p>
    <p>Af­ter 190 starts and in his penul­ti­mate race for Rac­ing Point, the 30-year-old, whose fu­ture in the sport re­mains un­cer­tain, was in fan­tasy land un­der the flood­lights at Bahrain’s desert Sakhir cir­cuit.</p>
    <p>“I’m shocked. I don’t want to be too ex­cited be­cause I dream of this time so many times that when I wake up it hurts,” he said af­ter go­ing from last on the open­ing lap to tak­ing the che­quered flag.</p>
    <p>“I have to make sure this is not a dream. I’ve been dream­ing of this mo­ment for 10 years.”</p>
    <p>The last and only Mex­i­can F1 race win­ner be­fore Perez was the late Pe­dro Ro­driguez, one of two broth­ers af­ter whom the Mex­ico City cir­cuit is named, in Bel­gium in 1970.</p>
    <p>Perez had come close be­fore, fin­ish­ing sec­ond i n Tur­key last month, but with­out ever reach­ing that top step on the podium.</p>
    <p>He did it the hard way on Sun­day, pit­ting af­ter a first-lap col­li­sion and fight­ing back from 18th and last spot in an as­ton­ish­ing vic­tory that brought tears to his eyes.</p>
    <p>Perez was helped by a rare Mercedes pit-stop blun­der, the cham­pi­ons mix­ing up the tyres for Valt­teri Bot­tas and Lewis Hamil­ton’s stand-in, Ge­orge Russell, who also suf­fered a late punc­ture.</p>
    <p>“When I got hit into the first cor­ner, I thought not again, it can­not be us again,” he said of the in­ci­dent that ended the race for Max Ver­stap­pen of Red Bull and Charles Le­clerc.</p>
    <p>The Fer­rari driver will have a three-place grid drop at this week­end’s sea­son-end­ing Abu Dhabi Grand Prix af­ter he caused the col­li­sion by brak­ing too late into Turn 4.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter the first lap, the race was gone. But it was all about not giv­ing up, re­cov­er­ing, go­ing for it, mak­ing the best we pos­si­bly could,” Perez added. “The luck hasn’t been with us this year but we fi­nally got it and I think we won to­day on merit.”</p>
    <p>Call­ing his win­ning podium place “a mo­ment in my life for my family, for my­self” he was also adamant that he would stay in F1, adding: “Af­ter to­day, I’m de­ter­mined to be here. My best op­tion is to keep go­ing next year but if I have to stop, it is not a dis­as­ter, I can come back in 2022.”</p>
    <p>Rac­ing Point owner Lawrence Stroll hopes that teams will take a chance on Perez, who will make way for four-time world cham­pion Se­bas­tian Vet­tel of Fer­rari next sea­son.</p>
    <p>Spec­u­la­tion re­mains that Red Bull may drop Thai­land’s Alexan­der Al­bon, who has yet to prove him­self along­side Ver­stap­pen.</p>
    <p>On the pos­si­bil­ity of Perez re­main­ing on the grid, Stroll said: “Checo has been a fan­tas­tic as­set and he’s been an as­set for this team a long time be­fore I’ve ar­rived.</p>
    <p>“He most def­i­nitely proves ev­ery week­end that he de­serves to be in a car next year and I hope he’s in that Red Bull (car) next year.”</p>
    <p>While Russell was “gut­ted” af­ter fin­ish­ing ninth, hav­ing ap­peared to be set for vic­tory, Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff said “a new star has been born”, al­though he con­firmed there was no place on the ros­ter for him next term.</p>
    <p>On the 22-year-old Bri­ton, who fi­nally got into the points for the first time fol­low­ing two years with Wil­liams, he said: “It won’t have been his last at­tempt for vic­tory. It’s just the be­gin­ning of a fairy tale that didn’t work out to­day.</p>
    <p>“We have learned that Russell is some­one we can count on in the fu­ture. He has the po­ten­tial and the ingredient­s a fu­ture star needs.”</p>
