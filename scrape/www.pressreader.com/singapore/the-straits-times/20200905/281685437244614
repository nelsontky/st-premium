    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has af­fected dif­fer­ent seg­ments of the pop­u­la­tion to dif­fer­ent de­grees, so there is now a need to re­new the so­cial com­pact, Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Des­mond Lee said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Amid this cri­sis, Sin­ga­pore is fac­ing dif­fi­cult ques­tions, as are many so­ci­eties around the world, he added. For in­stance, there have been calls to ad­dress the in­creas­ing so­cio-eco­nomic di­vide be­tween those who have more and those who have less, he said.</p>
    <p>There has also been a push to reeval­u­ate the value of dif­fer­ent jobs and how much es­sen­tial work­ers are paid, he added.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers have asked for a re­assess­ment of the kinds of fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance needed to mit­i­gate in­come and job loss in the medium- to longer-term.</p>
    <p>Also, there has been re­newed fo­cus about the deep-rooted as­sump­tions and bi­ases in so­ci­ety, and how peo­ple in­ter­act with one an­other on­line and off­line, Mr Lee said.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing in Par­lia­ment on the fi­nal day of the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress, he said: “The virus has shown us, quite starkly, that none of us is safe, un­til all of us are safe. The broader point is that our well-be­ing very much de­pends on one an­other.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lee, who is also the Min­is­terin-charge of So­cial Ser­vices In­te­gra­tion, said Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob has called for this gen­er­a­tion of lead­ers and Sin­ga­pore­ans to forge their own com­pact.</p>
    <p>“If we want Sin­ga­pore to stay united and strong, we must re­new our shared un­der­stand­ing of who we as­pire to be,” he added.</p>
    <p>In his speech, Mr Lee mapped out the im­pact of the pan­demic, which he said af­fected Sin­ga­pore­ans uni­ver­sally, but not felt equally.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, he said some peo­ple have jobs that al­low them to work from home or are work­ing in in­dus­tries that are see­ing a strong de­mand now, like e-com­merce.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers like es­sen­tial work­ers, such as med­i­cal staff and clean­ers, do not have the lux­ury of work­ing from home and face risks of catch­ing the virus on the front lines of their work­places, he added.</p>
    <p>Then, there are those in the hard­est-hit sec­tors, like avi­a­tion, tourism, re­tail and food and bev­er­age, who have taken steep pay cuts or lost their jobs, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee noted the calls by var­i­ous Mem­bers of Par­lia­ment such as Mr Fahmi Ali­man (Marine Pa­rade GRC) and Mr Den­nis Tan (Hougang) to strengthen the so­cial safety nets.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong and Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat also high­lighted dur­ing the de­bate how the Gov­ern­ment has boosted so­cial safety nets sig­nif­i­cantly as the econ­omy ma­tured, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said the Gov­ern­ment will con­tinue to do more to help Sin­ga­pore­ans, given the greater eco­nomic un­cer­tain­ties ahead as well as an age­ing pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>There have been dif­fer­ent sug­ges­tions to strengthen the so­cial safety nets, such as in­tro­duc­ing a min­i­mum wage or un­em­ploy­ment in­sur­ance, he added, on top of cur­rent mea­sures such as the Pro­gres­sive Wage Model and Work­fare.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said: “We will study these ideas se­ri­ously, while en­sur­ing that our over­all sys­tem re­mains fair and sus­tain­able for gen­er­a­tions to come.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, there is also a need for Sin­ga­pore­ans to be part of the ef­fort to build what he called “a com­mu­nity of care”.</p>
    <p>He said: “What we need is not just many help­ing hands, but hands that help in a more co­or­di­nated and per­sonal way, to un­lock spe­cific shack­les that con­strain these in­di­vid­u­als and fam­i­lies from pro­gress­ing in their lives.”</p>
    <p>There is a need for bet­ter co­or­di­na­tion be­tween the Gov­ern­ment, so­cial ser­vice agen­cies, grass­roots and re­li­gious groups, among other ways to strengthen how so­cial ser­vices are de­liv­ered, he added.</p>
