    <p>Two chil­dren of Turk­ish mi­grants, both med­i­cal stu­dents, met in the 1990s in Ger­many and fell in love while bal­anc­ing their work find­ing a cure for cancer.</p>
    <p>Dr Ugur Sahin and Dr Ozlem Tureci are now known as the physi­cians fu­elling Pfizer’s suc­cess with its can­di­date for a Covid-19 vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The pair, who are mar­ried to each other, had worked in the rel­a­tively new area – im­munother­apy, which taps the body’s own sys­tem to fight the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>In 2001, they set up Ganymed Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals and con­tin­ued their work on cancer im­munother­a­pies, be­fore sell­ing the firm in 2016 for €1.4 bil­lion (S$2.23 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>But they per­sisted with their re­search on mod­i­fied ge­netic code, or Mes­sen­ger RNA (mRNA), by set­ting up BioN­Tech.</p>
    <p>They be­lieved the mod­i­fied mRNA could be used to trick the body into fight­ing cancer. It proved piv­otal in de­sign­ing a Covid-19 vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The pact be­tween the Amer­i­can phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal gi­ant Pfizer and BioN­Tech has pro­duced a two-shot vac­cine can­di­date that re­port­edly had an ef­fi­cacy rate of over 90 per cent in late-stage clin­i­cal tri­als.</p>
    <p>MOVED TO GER­MANY</p>
    <p>Dr Tureci, the 53-year-old chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer of BioN­Tech, grew up in north-west Ger­many. Her fa­ther, who was born in Is­tan­bul, had worked as a sur­geon in the small Ger­man town.</p>
    <p>As for Dr Sahin, 55, he moved to Ger­many to­gether with his fa­ther when he was four years old.</p>
    <p>While his fa­ther worked in an au­to­mo­bile com­pany, he dreamt of do­ing some­thing that could change the world.</p>
    <p>Even at a young age, Dr Sahin saw No­bel prize-win­ning Ger­man physi­cian Paul Ehrlich as his role model. The sci­en­tist had worked in the field of im­munol­ogy and an­timi­cro­bial chemo­ther­apy, and in 1909,</p>
    <p>found a cure for syphilis.</p>
    <p>Dr Sahin’s work fol­lowed a sim­i­lar line and the cou­ple later learnt that by se­quenc­ing the tu­mour ma­te­rial, they could iden­tify the neoanti­gens the cancer pro­duces.</p>
    <p>With the right chem­i­cals, they found that the im­mune sys­tem</p>
    <p>could be di­rected to at­tack the mu­tated anti­gens, a highly in­di­vid­u­alised form of cancer treat­ment.</p>
    <p>Based on their re­search and ex­pe­ri­ence, the Turk­ish-Ger­man cou­ple ear­lier this year de­cided to take on the coro­n­avirus. Af­ter 10 months, BioN­Tech de­vel­oped with Pfizer the vac­cine can­di­date – BNT162b2.</p>
    <p>It was tested on 39,000 healthy in­di­vid­u­als in clin­i­cal tri­als. Now the firms need to prove that the vac­cine is safe.</p>
    <p>EMER­GENCY AU­THO­RI­SA­TION</p>
    <p>BioN­Tech is hop­ing that the United States’ Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA) will grant emer­gency au­tho­ri­sa­tion in the third week of this month, while the Euro­pean Union’s (EU) drug reg­u­la­tor, the Euro­pean Medicines Agency, is fast­track­ing the ap­proval process.</p>
    <p>“It is very im­por­tant for us to find a fair process to di­vide the vac­cine. The pan­demic is very present ev­ery­where. We will try to pro­vide the doses in the dif­fer­ent re­gions,” Dr Sahin, BioN­Tech’s chief ex­ec­u­tive, said in an in­ter­view with the Ger­man daily Frank­furter All­ge­meine Zeitung.</p>
    <p>The US had se­cured in sum­mer 100 mil­lion doses for al­most US$2 bil­lion (S$2.7 bil­lion), which would mean a sin­gle dose would cost US$20.</p>
    <p>“The price will be based on the eco­nomic strength of the re­spec­tive re­gion,” Dr Sahin said.</p>
    <p>For full immunisati­on, two doses of the vac­cine must be ad­min­is­tered within 28 days of each other.</p>
    <p>The EU this week signed an agree­ment with Pfizer and BioN­Tech for the de­liv­ery of 300 mil­lion doses.</p>
    <p>In prin­ci­ple, all 27 mem­bers of the EU should have equal ac­cess to the vac­cine, which will be dis­trib­uted ac­cord­ing to the size of the pop­u­la­tion of each coun­try.</p>
    <p>With a share of 19 per cent of all peo­ple liv­ing in the EU, Ger­many would be en­ti­tled to re­ceive 57 mil­lion doses in the first tranche.</p>
    <p>Ger­man Min­is­ter of Health Jens Spahn be­lieved it would be dif­fi­cult to com­mu­ni­cate to the public if the coun­try is not among the first to re­ceive the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>He was al­lud­ing to the €375 mil­lion the Ger­man gov­ern­ment spent fund­ing BioN­Tech’s re­search.</p>
    <p>As for the mar­ried cou­ple, they are tak­ing the at­ten­tion in their stride. They con­tinue cy­cling ev­ery morn­ing from their apart­ment to work in Mainz, a mid-size city lo­cated around 40km west of Frank­furt.</p>
    <p>Their of­fice has a fit­ting ad­dress – An der Gold­grube 12. Trans­lated, it means “at the gold­mine 12”.</p>
