    <p>• Liver­pool man­ager Jur­gen Klopp has wel­comed the news that 2,000 fans will be al­lowed into An­field, starting from next month, as a small step in the right di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>The city of Liver­pool has been placed un­der Tier 2 Covid-19 re­stric­tions by the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment, paving the way for a limited re­turn of fans for the first time since March.</p>
    <p>While London clubs will also be per­mit­ted to al­low fans back in small num­bers next month, many Pre­mier League clubs in­clud­ing Manch­ester United, Manch­ester City, New­cas­tle and those in the</p>
    <p>Mid­lands will not as they are in Tier 3 ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool’s game at Brighton & Hove Al­bion to­day will be with­out fans, as the new mea­sures come into ef­fect next week.</p>
    <p>How­ever, 2,000 fans will be per­mit­ted to at­tend Liver­pool’s home game with Wolver­hamp­ton Wan­der­ers next week­end.</p>
    <p>Asked at his vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day whether it would be an ad­van­tage for his ti­tle win­ners, Klopp said: “I said be­fore I knew which tier Liver­pool would be in, it’s not about dis­cussing the ad­van­tage or dis­ad­van­tage of this or that.</p>
    <p>“It’s mak­ing small steps in the right di­rec­tion. I’m happy that we can bring in 2,000 peo­ple, no­body knows how long we will be able to do that, but I think we should dis</p>
    <p>cuss not on the ba­sis of an ad­van­tage for this or that team.</p>
    <p>“The world is in a dif­fi­cult place and we all wait for small steps. This is a small step in the right di­rec­tion.”</p>
    <p>Klopp was less happy, how­ever, with the sched­ul­ing which means his side face the Seag­ulls in an early kick-off to­day, hav­ing played Ata­lanta in the Cham­pi­ons League</p>
    <p>on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“My thoughts about this are clear,” said the Ger­man, who blasted broad­caster Sky Sports ear­lier in the week for “not car­ing” about his play­ers’ wel­fare.</p>
    <p>“It’s not the time to think about it now. I have to pre­pare for it. Looks like un­til end of year, it is only us (play­ing Wed­nes­day, then Satur­day).</p>
    <p>“What­ever I say doesn’t help, so I stop talk­ing. It’s just a waste of time. In this mo­ment, we play in 25 hours and I have to pre­pare a team.</p>
    <p>“Wed­nes­day-Satur­day 12.30pm, you have to ask other peo­ple why they do that. I don’t have the an­swer.”</p>
    <p>The Reds can go top if they avoid de­feat at the Amex Sta­dium and Klopp is hope­ful that skip­per Jor­dan Hen­der­son will be avail­able, after re­cov­er­ing from a mus­cle in­jury picked up play­ing for Eng­land against Bel­gium ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>“Hendo trained yes­ter­day as part of an in­di­vid­ual session,” said Klopp, who will be with­out Naby Keita, Alex Oxlade-Cham­ber­lain, Trent Alexan­der-Arnold, Xher­dan Shaqiri and long-term ab­sen­tees Joe Gomez and Vir­gil van Dijk.</p>
    <p>“Only a few days in be­tween, so we make late de­ci­sions. If you asked me my line-up, I couldn’t tell you. I have to wait for the med­i­cal depart­ment to tell me.”</p>
    <p>On the re­union with Brighton mid­fielder Adam Lal­lana, who de­parted An­field in the sum­mer, Klopp joked: “We still miss him... he is our friend for life... but not this week!”</p>
    <p>It’s mak­ing small steps in the right di­rec­tion. I’m happy that we can bring in 2,000 peo­ple.</p>
