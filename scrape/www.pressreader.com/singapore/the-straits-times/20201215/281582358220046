    <p>Lo­cal at­trac­tions can ap­ply to in­crease their op­er­at­ing ca­pac­ity from 50 per cent to up to 65 per cent when Singapore en­ters phase three from Dec 28, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said yesterday.</p>
    <p>The ca­pac­ity limit for malls and large stand­alone stores will be in­creased from 10 sq m per per­son to 8 sq m per per­son, though mea­sures to pre­vent crowd­ing in pop­u­lar ar­eas re­main in place, the min­istry said as it de­tailed the fur­ther eas­ing of re­stric­tions in var­i­ous ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence yesterday, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said Singapore is also pre­pared to al­low fur­ther re­lax­ation of mea­sures – be it for do­mes­tic ac­tiv­i­ties or bor­der con­trol – fur­ther along phase three of its re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>“The ap­proach we will take is to con­duct pi­lots in higher-risk ac­tiv­i­ties and set­tings... be­fore we de­cide to take a fur­ther move,” said Mr Wong, who co-chairs the mul­ti­min­istry task force on Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Re­stric­tions on re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions, wed­dings, funer­als and live per­for­mances will also be re­laxed.</p>
    <p>All re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions will be al­lowed to in­crease their ca­pac­ity for con­gre­ga­tional and other wor­ship ser­vices to a max­i­mum of 250 peo­ple, as tri­als have shown that they have been able to do so safely.</p>
    <p>Live per­for­mances will also be al­lowed to re­sume for wor­ship ser­vices, along with rites and pray­ers held at places of wor­ship.</p>
    <p>Th­ese per­for­mances may in­volve a lim­ited num­ber of singers, as well as wind in­stru­ments like flutes and other in­stru­ments, with safe man­age­ment mea­sures in place.</p>
    <p>Live in­stru­men­tal mu­sic will be al­lowed for mar­riage solem­ni­sa­tions in indoor venues, as well as funer­als, though wind in­stru­ments will not be al­lowed for th­ese events.</p>
    <p>Up to eight vis­i­tors can at­tend mar­riage solem­ni­sa­tions held in the home. Cur­rently, a to­tal of 10 peo­ple – in­clud­ing mem­bers of the host­ing house­hold, but ex­clud­ing the solem­niser and ven­dors – are al­lowed.</p>
    <p>Indoor live per­for­mances will also be al­lowed to have au­di­ences of up to 250, while on­go­ing pi­lots for out­door live per­for­mances can ex­pand to a ca­pac­ity of 250, up from the cur­rent 100.</p>
    <p>For th­ese per­for­mances, peo­ple must re­main seg­re­gated in zones of up to 50 peo­ple each.</p>
    <p>Pi­lots will con­tinue for busk­ing and live per­for­mances at out­door venues, karaoke and nightlife, to help the au­thor­i­ties as­sess how th­ese ac­tiv­i­ties can take place and be scaled up safely.</p>
    <p>Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said En­ter­prise Singapore will be work­ing with ma­jor re­tail­ers to see how their stores’ lay­out can be im­proved to cre­ate more space for shop­pers to be dis­persed.</p>
    <p>This may in­clude tap­ping space out­side of their premises.</p>
    <p>“This is to make sure that we are able to bet­ter man­age the crowd dur­ing the year-end fes­tive sea­son and also the pe­riod to­wards Chi­nese New Year,” said Mr Chan, adding that more an­nounce­ments will be made sep­a­rately.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong noted that Singapore has made good progress on the pre-con­di­tions that it had spelt out for mov­ing into phase three.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes adop­tion of the</p>
    <p>TraceTo­gether pro­gramme, which has about 65 per cent of the res­i­dent pop­u­la­tion par­tic­i­pat­ing in it as at Sun­day. MOH said the coun­try is on track to hit its tar­get of about 70 per cent by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>The im­ple­men­ta­tion of TraceTo­gether-only SafeEn­try – where the TraceTo­gether app or to­ken is re­quired for SafeEn­try check-ins – will be car­ried out only early next year, said MOH.</p>
    <p>This con­tact trac­ing re­quire­ment will kick in only af­ter ev­ery­one who wants a to­ken has had a chance to col­lect one at a com­mu­nity club or cen­tre in his con­stituency.</p>
    <p>Un­til then, vis­i­tors can per­form SafeEn­try check-in via the TraceTo­gether app, SingPass Mo­bile app, their iden­tity cards and so on.</p>
    <p>Singapore has also in­creased its poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) test ca­pac­ity sig­nif­i­cantly – it can now run more than 50,000 tests a day, MOH said.</p>
    <p>Anti­gen rapid tests for larger and higher-risk events have also been in­tro­duced.</p>
    <p>Most busi­nesses and mem­bers of the pub­lic have also been co­op­er­at­ing with safe man­age­ment mea­sures, MOH noted, adding that th­ese ef­forts have helped keep com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion low.</p>
    <p>STANCE ON EAS­ING OF MEA­SURES</p>
    <p>The ap­proach we will take is to con­duct pi­lots in higher-risk ac­tiv­i­ties and set­tings... be­fore we de­cide to take a ’’ fur­ther move.</p>
    <p>ED­U­CA­TION MIN­IS­TER LAWRENCE WONG, who co-chairs the multi-min­istry task force on Covid-19.</p>
