    <p>Dig­i­tal­is­ing im­por­tant doc­u­ments like a Last­ing Power of At­tor­ney (LPA) could soon be on the cards, un­der pro­posed changes to the law that gov­erns elec­tronic trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>As part of its broader dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion jour­ney, the Govern­ment seeks to dig­i­talise an LPA which al­lows an ap­pointed per­son to make med­i­cal and fi­nan­cial de­ci­sions on an­other’s be­half should the lat­ter lose men­tal ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>It will also al­low cross-bor­der trade doc­u­ments to be dig­i­talised, thereby re­duc­ing the time and money re­quired to process a huge amount of pa­per­work.</p>
    <p>The amend­ment to the Elec­tronic Trans­ac­tions Act was in­tro­duced in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day by Min­is­ter for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion and Min­is­ter-in-charge of Trade Re­la­tions S. Iswaran.</p>
    <p>The Act pro­vides le­gal cer­tainty for dig­i­tal trans­ac­tions, en­ables e-govern­ment ser­vices and puts in place a frame­work for se­cure elec­tronic sig­na­tures.</p>
    <p>On the is­sue of dig­i­tal­is­ing LPAs, the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment (MSF) con­ducted a pub­lic con­sul­ta­tion late last year.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, only hard copies of LPAs are ac­cepted.</p>
    <p>MSF said last Oc­to­ber that dig­i­tal­is­ing this doc­u­ment could cut the time needed to reg­is­ter an LPA from an av­er­age of three weeks to eight work­ing days. This ex­cludes a three-week manda­tory wait­ing pe­riod dur­ing which a per­son can with­draw his ap­pli­ca­tion and the per­son ap­pointed to act on his be­half can also raise ob­jec­tions.</p>
    <p>The Elec­tronic Trans­ac­tions (Amend­ment) Bill, which was the only Bill in­tro­duced in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day, also seeks to re­duce the amount of pa­per­work in­volved in cross-bor­der trade by al­low­ing for dig­i­tal doc­u­men­ta­tion with in­ter­na­tional ports.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, most of mar­itime trade in­volves the use of phys­i­cal bills of lad­ing, which are le­gal and com­mer­cial doc­u­ments pro­vid­ing ev­i­dence for the con­tract of car­riage, re­ceipt and own­er­ship of goods for a cargo ship­ment.</p>
    <p>Given the in­tri­ca­cies of mar­itime trade law, the pa­per trail typ­i­cally runs up to hun­dreds of pages for a sin­gle trans­ac­tion. These take a large amount of time and money to process.</p>
    <p>Re­search by con­tainer ship­ping gi­ant Maersk and tech firm IBM in 2014 showed the cost of pro­cess­ing trade doc­u­ments made up as much as 20 per cent of the cost of mov­ing goods.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal­is­ing trade doc­u­ments would sig­nif­i­cantly en­hance ef­fi­ciency and pro­duc­tiv­ity. The Bill will do this by align­ing Sin­ga­pore with stan­dards from the United Na­tions Com­mis­sion on In­ter­na­tional Trade Law, which spells out an in­ter­na­tion­ally har­monised le­gal frame­work for elec­tronic records.</p>
    <p>In De­cem­ber, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said that Sin­ga­pore is cur­rently tri­alling dig­i­tal doc­u­men­ta­tion with two ports in China – Qinzhou and Tian­jin – to fa­cil­i­tate trade by re­duc­ing the amount of pa­per­work in­volved.</p>
    <p>The tri­als are part of Sin­ga­pore’s move to build its Net­worked Trade Plat­form, which will al­low for elec­tronic ex­changes of doc­u­ments needed for im­port and ex­port, Mr Heng added.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore launched the Net­worked Trade Plat­form ini­tia­tive in 2018 to cut back on the pa­per­work in­volved in cross-bor­der trade and re­duce the time needed for im­port and ex­port of goods, among other ben­e­fits.</p>
