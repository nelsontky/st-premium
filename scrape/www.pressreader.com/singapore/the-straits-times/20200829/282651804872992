    <p>It has been a sur­real jour­ney for 35-year-old Amer­i­can singer Katy Perry, be­ing preg­nant and giv­ing birth dur­ing a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, she and English ac­tor Or­lando Bloom, 43, wel­comed their first child, Daisy.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment was first made on the United Na­tions Chil­dren’s Fund (Unicef) In­sta­gram page on the same day. The cou­ple are Unicef Good­will Am­bas­sadors.</p>
    <p>Ac­com­pa­nied by a photo of the new par­ents hold­ing their baby girl’s tiny hand, the post read: “Wel­come to the world, Daisy Dove Bloom!”</p>
    <p>It also in­cluded quotes from the cou­ple, who met in 2016 and were en­gaged last year.</p>
    <p>“We are float­ing with love and won­der from the safe and healthy ar­rival of our daugh­ter,” they said.</p>
    <p>But even as they basked in the joy of their new­born, the cou­ple did not for­get about the less for­tu­nate.</p>
    <p>“We know we’re the lucky ones and not every­one can have a birthing ex­pe­ri­ence as peace­ful as ours was,” they said, adding that “com­mu­ni­ties around the world are still ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a short­age of health­care work­ers”.</p>
    <p>They also noted: “And every 11 sec­onds, a preg­nant woman or new­born dies, mostly from pre­ventable causes. With Covid-19, many more new­born lives are at risk be­cause of the in­creased lack of ac­cess to wa­ter, soap, vac­cines and medicines that pre­vent dis­eases. As par­ents to a new­born, this breaks our hearts, as we em­pathise with strug­gling par­ents now more than ever.”</p>
    <p>To cel­e­brate Daisy’s birth, Perry and Bloom set up a do­na­tion page. “By supporting them, you are supporting a safe start to life and reimag­in­ing a health­ier world for every child. We hope your heart can bloom with gen­eros­ity,” they wrote.</p>
