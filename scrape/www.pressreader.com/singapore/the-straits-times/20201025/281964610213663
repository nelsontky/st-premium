    <p>Imag­ine an app for a credit card that analy­ses your spend­ing, alerts you to shopping deals that you are in­ter­ested in, and of­fers you all kinds of ex­cit­ing con­tent on “in­fi­nite scroll”.</p>
    <p>At their fin­ger­tips, cof­fee lovers can eas­ily track their spend­ing at cafes, and pet own­ers will know how much they in­dulged on their furry friends.</p>
    <p>And the card user will see only con­tent that he prefers, suited to his needs. This is “su­per cus­tomi­sa­tion” of­fered by Hyundai Card, one of South Korea’s largest credit-card com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Tak­ing a leaf from tech gi­ants YouTube and Face­book, the com­pany is har­ness­ing big data and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) to achieve the “next fron­tier of per­son­alised ser­vices” and “rev­o­lu­tion­alise the way we live”.</p>
    <p>“We aim to pro­vide what the cus­tomer needs, based on the cus­tomer’s pref­er­ence,” said Mr Kim Bom-shik, head of the prod­uct plan­ning depart­ment at Hyundai Card.</p>
    <p>Per­son­al­i­sa­tion is said to be the fu­ture for the fi­nan­cial sec­tor, as more tech-savvy con­sumers turn to apps and on­line ser­vices for a more tai­lored ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>This can in­clude con­sumer-spe­cific alerts, and of­fers and sug­ges­tions of prod­ucts or ser­vices based on us­age and pref­er­ence.</p>
    <p>A 2019 KPMG re­port said “new tools and tech­nolo­gies are en­abling un­prece­dented cus­tomi­sa­tion” in bank­ing ser­vices, and that cus­tomers ranked banks with great per­son­al­i­sa­tion ca­pa­bil­i­ties as the “best in class”.</p>
    <p>“The fu­ture will be dom­i­nated by banks that go be­yond ‘skin deep’ per­son­al­i­sa­tion to em­bed them­selves into the daily lives of their cus­tomers,” the re­port said.</p>
    <p>“They will know more than just ac­count de­tails and de­mo­graph­ics; they will know ex­actly what makes their cus­tomers tick.”</p>
    <p>For Hyundai Card, this means in­vest­ing more than 300 billion won (S$361 mil­lion) to re­in­force data sci­ence ca­pa­bil­ity and hir­ing more than 350 dig­i­tal per­son­nel, in­clud­ing app de­vel­op­ers and user ex­pe­ri­ence de­sign­ers, to de­velop its dig­i­tal prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>The com­pany launched the 3.0 ver­sion of its app in Au­gust, work­ing with an Is­raeli an­a­lyt­ics com­pany to de­velop an AI-equipped spend­ing care ser­vice to help cus­tomers use credit cards more comfortabl­y.</p>
    <p>Hyundai Card is the first to use AI to anal­yse cus­tomer spend­ing and gain in­sights about con­sumer be­hav­iour, said Mr Kim.</p>
    <p>The up­graded app also rec­om­mends prod­ucts from an on­line mall oper­ated by Hyundai Card and of­fers scrol­lable con­tent tai­lored to the cus­tomer’s needs and in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>This can in­clude mo­bile games, shopping dis­counts, restau­rant and cafe coupons and travel deals of­fered by Hyundai Card’s part­ners, and in­for­ma­tion about new fi­nan­cial prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Which cat­e­gory ap­pears first de­pends on the cus­tomer’s pref­er­ence and click-through habits.</p>
    <p>“We want the scroll to be in­fi­nite like YouTube, but right now we can of­fer only 100 to 150 items per cus­tomer,” noted Mr Kim. “But we can pro­vide more con­tent if the cus­tomer uses the card more and gives us more data. The app will evolve to­gether with the cus­tomer.”</p>
    <p>An­other new func­tion is a quiz ask­ing cus­tomers to guess their monthly ex­penses and of­fer­ing a com­par­i­son to other sim­i­lar card users. “We wanted to give cus­tomers some­thing fun to do and make them aware of their spend­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>“At the same time, we want them to know how much we un­der­stand them, and that we are here to help them make in­formed spend­ing de­ci­sions.”</p>
    <p>Out of the four mil­lion peo­ple who use the app every month, more than a mil­lion now log in every day – up from 500,000 early this year.</p>
    <p>“Users are stay­ing in the app for a longer time read­ing the in­for­ma­tion we pro­vide. There’s more trust in the con­tent that we pro­vide, and this will gain more loy­alty for Hyundai Card,” said Mr Kim.</p>
    <p>He added that work is now be­ing done to make the app more in­ter­ac­tive, such as al­low­ing users to give a “thumbs up” when they see con­tent they like.</p>
    <p>The rise of hyper-per­son­al­i­sa­tion also calls into ques­tion is­sues of pri­vacy in­va­sion and pos­si­ble data breaches.</p>
    <p>When asked, Mr Kim gave the as­sur­ance that South Korea has a strict per­sonal in­for­ma­tion pro­tec­tion Act in place, and that cus­tomers will re­ceive only tar­geted mar­ket­ing ma­te­ri­als with their agree­ment.</p>
    <p>The com­pany also has se­cu­rity pro­to­cols in place to guard against data breaches, he added.</p>
    <p>Of­fice worker Kim Seong-soo, 35, finds the new Hyundai Card app very friendly to use. It is like look­ing through a so­cial-me­dia feed, he said.</p>
    <p>“It is sim­ple yet in­sight­ful. I can eas­ily search for my ex­pen­di­ture record and credit-card ben­e­fits, and it of­fers rec­om­men­da­tions about prod­ucts,” he added.</p>
    <p>“It feels like I can re­ceive what I need even be­fore I re­ally know what I want.”</p>
