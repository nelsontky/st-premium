    <p>Emis­sions of the pow­er­ful green­house gas meth­ane have reached a record, a global anal­y­sis has found, driven in large part by mankind’s un­re­lent­ing de­mand for beef and en­ergy, par­tic­u­larly liq­ue­fied nat­u­ral gas (LNG).</p>
    <p>Meth­ane is a key com­po­nent of nat­u­ral gas and is far more ef­fec­tive in trap­ping heat in the at­mos­phere than car­bon diox­ide (CO2) – the main green­house gas.</p>
    <p>While there is a lot more CO2 in the air, adding meth­ane is like pour­ing fuel on a fire and is giv­ing cli­mate change an ex­tra kick.</p>
    <p>The Global Meth­ane Bud­get, pub­lished this week in the j our­nals Earth Sys­tem Science Data and En­vi­ron­men­tal Re­search Let­ters, stud­ied the growth of the gas in the at­mos­phere from 2000 to 2017, the lat­est year for which global data is avail­able. It also stud­ied the “sinks”, where meth­ane is de­stroyed over time in the air and soil.</p>
    <p>The anal­y­sis re­vealed nearly 10 per cent growth in meth­ane emis­sions over the pe­riod and that about 60 per cent of all emis­sions are man­made, mainly from agri­cul­ture and fos­sil fu­els. The rest comes from wet­lands and other nat­u­ral sources.</p>
    <p>The re­lent­less rise in meth­ane is bad news be­cause, com­bined with grow­ing CO2 emis­sions, the world is on a path to warm by around 3 deg C by the end of the cen­tury.</p>
    <p>Mak­ing deep cuts in both, and soon, can help the world avert in­creas­ingly se­vere storms and droughts and faster sea level rise.</p>
    <p>“The con­tro­versy is who is the worst of­fender in terms of meth­ane growth in the at­mos­phere – is it cows or the frack­ing guys?” said Dr Pep Canadell, ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of the Global Car­bon Project, which con­ducted the nearly four-year anal­y­sis in col­lab­o­ra­tion with about 70 in­sti­tu­tions glob­ally.</p>
    <p>“As this pa­per shows... agri­cul­ture is still more im­por­tant – there are still more emis­sions from farm­ing than fos­sil fu­els,” Dr Canadell, one of the study’s au­thors, told The Straits Times from Can­berra yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He said that live­stock, par­tic­u­larly cows and sheep, was the largest source of mankind’s meth­ane emis­sions, driven in part by the grow­ing mid­dle-class de­mand for meat.</p>
    <p>Rice farm­ing is an­other ma­jor source of meth­ane, along with ma­nure, wood burn­ing and bush fires, and even ter­mites.</p>
    <p>Ru­mi­nant an­i­mals, such as cows, burp out a lot of meth­ane dur­ing di­ges­tion of their food. One way to tackle this has been to feed cows sup­ple­ments that cut down the amount of meth­ane they pro­duce.</p>
    <p>Surg­ing de­mand for nat­u­ral gas and, un­til rel­a­tively re­cently, coal, has also been a big driver. Meth­ane comes from coal mines, leaky gas pipe­lines, oil and gas wells, and even house­hold cook­tops.</p>
    <p>Meth­ane emis­sions grew quick­est in three re­gions: Africa and the Mid­dle East; China; and South Asia and Ocea­nia, in­clud­ing Aus­tralia, said the study.</p>
    <p>Dr Canadell said a surge in coal use and coal min­ing caused meth­ane emis­sions to jump in China un­til 2013, when coal use there largely plateaued. Since then, the ex­plo­sive growth of LNG pro­duc­tion and con­sump­tion has helped ac­cel­er­ate lev­els of the gas in the at­mos­phere.</p>
    <p>The good news is that meth­ane does not last very long in the at­mos­phere – about nine years be­fore it is bro­ken down, ver­sus the life­time of cen­turies to thou­sands of years for CO2.“Re­duc­ing meth­ane emis­sions is there­fore recog­nised as an ef­fec­tive op­tion for rapid cli­mate change mit­i­ga­tion,” the sci­en­tists said.</p>
    <p>Fix­ing leaky pipe­lines and oil and gas wells, as well as over­haul­ing agri­cul­ture are all vi­tal steps to re­duce meth­ane emis­sions.</p>
    <p>But Dr Canadell has doubts the nat­u­ral gas sec­tor’s meth­ane emis­sions will drop in the near term, given the de­mand for en­ergy.</p>
