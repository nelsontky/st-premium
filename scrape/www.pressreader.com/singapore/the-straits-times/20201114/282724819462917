    <p>ALBIREX NI­IGATA’S SU­PE­RIOR GOAL DIF­FER­ENCE ATOP THE SPL</p>
    <p>A DIF­FER­ENT GAME</p>
    <p>The for­eign dom­i­na­tion of the Sin­ga­pore Premier League (SPL) may con­tinue for a fifth suc­ces­sive sea­son, de­spite the with­drawal of cham­pi­ons Brunei DPMM FC.</p>
    <p>But Gey­lang In­ter­na­tional coach Noor Ali was less than im­pressed with Albirex Ni­igata’s style of play af­ter watch­ing his side fall 1-0 to the Ja­panese side yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The re­sult saw Albirex re­turn to the top of the ta­ble on 17 points from eight games and leapfrog Tampines Rovers on goal dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Noor, how­ever, sug­gested that Albirex are no longer play­ing the brand of foot­ball that dis­placed DPMM in 2016 and won them two more ti­tles.</p>
    <p>“We did not ex­pect Albirex to keep pump­ing long balls like this,” he said.</p>
    <p>“This is not the same flow­ing foot­ball we looked up to when they won the league from 2016 to 2018.”</p>
    <p>The Ea­gles got off to a night­mar­ish start when skip­per Yuki Ichikawa fouled Ry­oya Taniguchi af­ter be­ing pick­pock­eted by the Albirex mid­fielder. From the re­sult­ing third-minute free kick, To­moyuki Doi beat Hairul Syirhan at the near post for his sixth goal of the sea­son and the win­ner.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Gey­lang, who left their trio of na­tional for­wards Khairul Nizam, Fa­reez Farhan and Iqbal Hus­sain on the bench to ful­fil the Un­der-23 quota, did not buckle, and were un­lucky not to score be­fore the break.</p>
    <p>They re­sponded al­most im­me­di­ately with a good break down the left, but Harith Kanadi’s shot flashed just wide. Fir­daus Kas­man and Barry Maguire also tested Kei</p>
    <p>Okawa, but lacked power and di­rec­tion to beat the Albirex goal­keeper.</p>
    <p>Noor threw on Nizam and Iqbal at the start of the sec­ond half and also Fa­reez later on. But the elu­sive equaliser just would not come, de­spite the hosts seiz­ing the ini­tia­tive in the sec­ond stanza.</p>
    <p>Nizam headed over Harith’s cross in the 57th minute, while Iqbal glided past the Albirex de­fence only to be stopped by Okawa in the 87th minute as the White Swans held on.</p>
    <p>Noor be­moaned the early lapse but was pleased with how his men re­sponded.</p>
    <p>Albirex coach Keiji Shige­tomi was also happy with his side, prais­ing his play­ers for show­ing the nec­es­sary fight­ing spirit to re­bound from l ast month’s 2-0 l oss to Tampines at the same venue.</p>
    <p>He said: “This is al­ways a dif­fi­cult ground to come to. I agree our per­for­mance is not great, but some­times you have to find ways to win, and we did that tonight.</p>
    <p>“We are not think­ing about the ti­tle yet, what is more im­por­tant is that we fo­cus on get­ting the three points in the next game.”</p>
    <p>In the other SPL match of the night, the Lion City Sailors kept up the pres­sure on the lead­ers by thump­ing Tan­jong Pa­gar United 6-1 at Bis­han Sta­dium to stay third with 14 points.</p>
    <p>Gey­lang are sixth with 10 points, seven i n front of the win­less Jaguars in the eight-team SPL.</p>
    <p>We did not ex­pect Albirex to keep pump­ing long balls like this. This is not the same flow­ing foot­ball we looked up to when they won the league from 2016 to 2018.</p>
