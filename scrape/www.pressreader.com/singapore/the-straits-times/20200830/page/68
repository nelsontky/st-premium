        | | B14 The Sunday Times Sunday, August 30, 2020 Me&MyMoney Eatery Greendot co-founder Justin Chou’s investment plan focuses on firms in sustainabl­e food supply space. B10 After a chat with Mr Chia, John also adjusted his expectatio­ns and has since found a job in a different sector.
He also took up Mr Chia’s advice to use his CPF Medisave funds to pay for an integrated shield plan for hospitalis­ation, and to use a small portion of his salary to pay for term life insurance.
Mr Chia says: “He is keeping his spirits high as he assumes more responsibi­lity in taking care of his family.” GETTING HITCHED IN A PANDEMIC David, who is in his early 30s, is feeling the pressure on three fronts.
He suffered a 70 per cent drop in his salary as his travel-related company was badly hit by the pandemic.
Then, he has to help his parents clear a huge credit card debt and, on top of that, he is due to get married this year.
At Mr Chia’s suggestion, his parents sought help from Credit Counsellin­g Singapore, which put them on a management programme to slowly pay off their debt.
He also helped David and his fiancee review their expenses and plans. “She is very understand­ing. The couple will proceed with their marriage plan but with a very simple ceremony,” he says.
A silver living is that both of them have adequate CPF savings, which allows them to consider buying a new or resale HDB flat.
“They can still proceed with the property purchase but with most of their funds in CPF used to buy their home, they will need to review their retirement planning soon when their situation improves later,” notes Mr Chia.
