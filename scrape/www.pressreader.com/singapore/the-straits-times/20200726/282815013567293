    <p>When the Covid-19 pan­demic first struck Sin­ga­pore, lo­cal hor­ti­cul­tural firm Na­ture Land­scapes knew it had to be pre­pared for busi­ness to be hit.</p>
    <p>Plan­ning from the out­set en­abled it to shift op­er­a­tions to home-based work ar­range­ments smoothly.</p>
    <p>But the firm did not ex­pect the pan­demic to drag on for as long as it has, with bot­tle­necks in of­fi­cial clear­ance for its mi­grant work­ers cre­at­ing more prob­lems, said the com­pany’s ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Jac­que­line Al­lan.</p>
    <p>It was well pre­pared in some ar­eas be­cause it had started get­ting ready as early as Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the of­fice team was al­ready mov­ing to an on­line cloud plat­form and video­con­fer­enc­ing tools. Most of the staff had also switched from desk­tops to lap­tops so they could work from home eas­ily.</p>
    <p>In March, the firm man­aged to do a trial run of its busi­ness con­ti­nu­ity plans be­fore the Gov­ern­ment made split op­er­a­tions manda­tory.</p>
    <p>It also man­aged to get an ex­emp­tion from the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try to be per­mit­ted to do some kinds of es­sen­tial main­te­nance work for its clients.</p>
    <p>But af­ter that it was just “one ob­sta­cle af­ter another”, said Ms Al­lan.</p>
    <p>New projects, a key source of rev­enue, com­pletely stalled.</p>
    <p>While pay­outs from the Gov­ern­ment’s Bud­get sup­port pack­ages helped, these only man­aged to cover some of the high over­head costs, not un­com­mon in the hor­ti­cul­tural in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Many are still los­ing money as their clients, who have them­selves been badly af­fected, need to rene­go­ti­ate fees, for ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>But with much of its work­force still un­able to work, Na­ture Land­scapes has also had to plead for un­der­stand­ing from clients to not pe­nalise them for the re­duced head­count at some sites.</p>
    <p>The clear­ance process for work­ers has held back much of the firm’s main­te­nance work­force, of which about half – or 100 work­ers – are for­eign­ers, Ms Al­lan said.</p>
    <p>One of the re­quire­ments for clear­ance, which is for stag­gered pickup and drop-off times for work­ers from the dorm, has also cut down the amount of time for ac­tual work, not to men­tion in­creas­ing trans­porta­tion costs for the firm.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, the firm sur­vived by hir­ing some 60 tem­po­rary work­ers. But af­ter Sin­ga­pore started re­open­ing its econ­omy early last month, many of these lo­cal tem­po­rary work­ers have gone back to their old jobs or sought other em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>The firm now faces a man­power crunch on top of its other prob­lems.</p>
    <p>Sungei Ten­gah Lodge, the dorm where its work­ers stay, was given the all-clear last Tues­day.</p>
    <p>But not all of the work­ers can re­turn to work; so far only 18 have been al­lowed to do so.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, in April, the com­pany man­aged to move 20 of its work­ers to its own tem­po­rary liv­ing quar­ters at its plant nurs­ery in nearby Sungei Ten­gah Road.</p>
    <p>Ms Al­lan called this group her “elite” team, work­ers who had per­formed very well and could be trusted to get any job done.</p>
    <p>One of them is 33-year-old Md Foysal, a su­per­vi­sor who spe­cialises in han­dling ma­chin­ery for land­scap­ing. The Bangladesh­i na­tional has spent all 11 years in Sin­ga­pore with Na­ture Land­scapes.</p>
    <p>Mr Foysal said he is happy he can still work. “My friends (in the dorm), they are happy to work and want to join, and have been ask­ing ‘When can we join?’ But they are not cleared,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Al­lan said that a sil­ver lin­ing has been the loy­alty and spirit of the firm’s staff, which shone through dur­ing this time of hard­ship.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean Rosli Latiff, 57, con­tin­ues to help as a site su­per­vi­sor for one of the firm’s clients in the Dairy Farm area, de­spite half his team – mi­grant work­ers – be­ing out of ac­tion.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one is wor­ried. But as long as we ob­serve the pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures, like wear­ing masks and sani­tis­ing our hands, we should be okay,” said Mr Rosli, who has been with the firm for over a decade.</p>
    <p>To show its ap­pre­ci­a­tion to its ground work­ers who are work­ing in the midst of the pan­demic, the firm de­cided to give an ad­di­tional al­lowance and pro­vide meals de­spite the ad­di­tional cost this would in­volve for the com­pany.</p>
    <p>For now, the com­pany is still barely man­ag­ing to stay afloat. But the im­me­di­ate fu­ture seems bleak, with Ms Al­lan es­ti­mat­ing losses of up to two-thirds of its rev­enue.</p>
    <p>“The cir­cuit breaker may have been lifted al­most two months ago, but for us, it is as if it has never ended,” she said.</p>
