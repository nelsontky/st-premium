    <p>Vet­eran sports ad­min­is­tra­tor Ng Ser Miang was re-elected a vi­cepres­i­dent of the In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee (IOC) at its 136th Ses­sion yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The 71-year-old Sin­ga­porean has served the IOC as a mem­ber since 1998 and was also vice-pres­i­dent from 2009 to 2013. He cur­rently chairs the IOC Fi­nance Com­mis­sion and Hu­man Re­source Com­mit­tee and was an ex­ec­u­tive board mem­ber from 2005 to 2009 and 2016 to this year.</p>
    <p>The IOC ex­ec­u­tive board com­prises the pres­i­dent, four vice-pres­i­dents and 10 other mem­bers. The board mem­bers are elected, by se­cret bal­lot, for four-year terms.</p>
    <p>The other vice-pres­i­den­tial slot up for grabs yes­ter­day went to Aus­tralian Olympic Com­mit­tee pres­i­dent John Coates. Ng, who gar­nered 82 of the 85 valid votes, and Coates, re­placed Turkey’s Ugur Er­dener and Spain’s Juan An­to­nio Sa­ma­ranch Jr.</p>
    <p>Ng, chair­man of the Sin­ga­pore Olympic Foun­da­tion and Sin­ga­pore Olympic Academy, said: “Be­ing able to serve on the IOC, be a part of the Olympic move­ment, and con­trib­ute to sport in my own way has al­ways been a role that I have seen as a rare priv­i­lege.</p>
    <p>GLOBAL CON­NEC­TION</p>
    <p>I will con­tinue to lever­age on my knowl­edge and net­work for the de­vel­op­ment of sports and the Olympic move­ment in Sin­ga­pore, and hope to sup­port more Sin­ga­pore­ans in serv­ing in in­ter­na­tional sports or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>NG SER MIANG, In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee vice-pres­i­dent, af­ter his elec­tion to the post yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“I look for­ward to work­ing shoul­der to shoul­der with my col­leagues on the ex­ec­u­tive board, un­der the lead­er­ship of (IOC pres­i­dent) Thomas Bach, as we adapt to the new nor­mal and con­tinue to sup­port the Olympic move­ment and the Olympic Games.</p>
    <p>“I will also con­tinue to lever­age on my knowl­edge and net­work for the de­vel­op­ment of sports and the Olympic move­ment in Sin­ga­pore, and hope to sup­port more Sin­ga­pore­ans in serv­ing in in­ter­na­tional sports or­gan­i­sa­tions.”</p>
    <p>Ng’s elec­tion was con­firmed at the IOC’s first vir­tual Ses­sion, the first gath­er­ing of world sport’s lead­ers since the start of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic that led to the post­pone­ment of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. In­stead of start­ing next week, the qua­dren­nial Games will now take place from July 23 to Aug 8 next year.</p>
    <p>At the Ses­sion, Bach also in­di­cated his readi­ness to run for the IOC pres­i­dency for a sec­ond term if he has the sup­port of the ma­jor­ity of its 105 mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the five-hour Ses­sion, the Tokyo or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee of the Olympic and Par­a­lympic Games an­nounced that all 42 venues, in­clud­ing the Olympic Vil­lage, in­ter­na­tional broad­cast­ing cen­tre and main press cen­tre, have been se­cured.</p>
    <p>Next year’s Olympics will also fol­low an al­most iden­ti­cal com­pe­ti­tion sched­ule as the one planned for this year be­fore the post­pone­ment, with just “small ad­just­ments” to tim­ings.</p>
    <p>The up­dated sched­ule means women’s soft­ball will kick off com­pe­ti­tion at 9am in Fukushima on July 21, two days be­fore the Games of­fi­cially open, with all events tak­ing place a day ear­lier than this year’s sched­ule.</p>
    <p>Tick­ets al­ready se­cured can be used for next year’s events, while re­fund op­tions are also avail­able to fans.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee pres­i­dent Yoshiro Mori said the ap­proach for the Tokyo Games will fo­cus on safety, se­cu­rity, and sim­plic­ity to re­duce the im­pact of the post­pone­ment, and a three-party coun­cil with the Ja­panese gov­ern­ment and the Tokyo Metropoli­tan gov­ern­ment will be set up to pre­pare for var­i­ous sce­nar­ios to safe­guard the health of all par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>Bach praised the “highly im­pres­sive” ef­forts and plans which give con­fi­dence to all that the Games will be a great cel­e­bra­tion of hu­man­ity, sol­i­dar­ity and re­silience.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Ses­sion also ap­proved the post­pone­ment of the Dakar 2022 Youth Olympic Games to 2026, a de­ci­sion an­nounced by the IOC ex­ec­u­tive board on Thurs­day fol­low­ing a re­quest from Sene­gal Pres­i­dent Macky Sall.</p>
    <p>The IOC had said the de­lay­ing of the first Olympic event to be held in Africa is due to the “large scale of the op­er­a­tional chal­lenges which the IOC, the na­tional Olympic com­mit­tees and the in­ter­na­tional fed­er­a­tions are fac­ing fol­low­ing the post­pone­ment of the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020”.</p>
