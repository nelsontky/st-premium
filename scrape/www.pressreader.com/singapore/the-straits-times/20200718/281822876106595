    <p>• Aus­tralia’s Vic­to­ria state re­ported a record daily in­crease in Covid-19 cases yes­ter­day, while neigh­bour­ing New South Wales said it was ban­ning danc­ing, sing­ing and min­gling at wed­dings as the au­thor­i­ties strug­gle to con­tain a new wave of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria, which has forced nearly five mil­lion peo­ple in the coun­try’s sec­ond-most pop­u­lous state into a par­tial lock­down for more than a week, said it had found 428 new Covid-19 cases over a 24-hour pe­riod, most from com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>The Vic­to­ria out­break led to Aus­tralia post­ing its sec­ond big­gest one-day rise in new Covid-19 in­fec­tions, with 438 cases yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It was the largest 24-hour spike since late March, when most cases de­tected in Aus­tralia were peo­ple re­turn­ing from overseas.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has recorded just over 11,000 cases of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of fa­tal­i­ties rose to 116 af­ter the death of three peo­ple in Vic­to­ria yes­ter­day, still well be­low many other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>New South Wales, Aus­tralia’s most pop­u­lous state, said it has found eight cases of Covid-19 over a 24-hour pe­riod, mostly from com­mu­nity trans­mis­sions be­lieved to have em­anated from Vic­to­ria.</p>
    <p>The surge in new cases re­in­forced ex­pec­ta­tions that Vic­to­ria will im­ple­ment tougher re­stric­tions on res­i­dents.</p>
