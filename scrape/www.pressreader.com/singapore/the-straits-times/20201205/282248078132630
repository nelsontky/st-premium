    <p>What do you do when a friend says some­thing ter­ri­ble? I was out for din­ner re­cently when some­one I have known for a long time dropped a bomb­shell dur­ing our con­ver­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>She notes that she would know her child is in trou­ble if she finds her­self in a class full of a cer­tain race.</p>
    <p>I choke on my drink. She does not bat an eye­lid. She might even think I am laugh­ing, or amused. At once I feel a gen­er­a­tional gap open up be­tween us. I am 24; she is 34 years old and a mother of three. A fully func­tional adult who should know bet­ter. I think, or hope.</p>
    <p>In fact, I’m not go­ing to re­peat her racist re­mark in full here.</p>
    <p>I’m not sure what to say.</p>
    <p>I’ve en­coun­tered in­stances where some older Sin­ga­pore­ans seem to ac­cept ca­sual racial stereo­typ­ing in con­ver­sa­tion, when such re­marks are be­com­ing nearly taboo among peo­ple my age. But my out­rage at her re­mark seems out of place – silly, and overly sen­si­tive.</p>
    <p>My al­co­hol-in­fused brain goes through the con­ver­sa­tional op­tions. I could say some­thing like “that’s not okay”, but do­ing so would si­lence my friend and cre­ate an in­cred­i­bly un­com­fort­able sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Or I could say noth­ing, and hope my con­science takes the night off.</p>
    <p>Or I could gen­tly protest and change the sub­ject. The worst and eas­i­est op­tion of three bad op­tions. The path of least re­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>I take the gen­tle protest and run with it. I say some­thing in­nocu­ous like: “That’s not re­ally okay to say.”</p>
    <p>We start talk­ing about the weather.</p>
    <p>Turn­ing over the in­ci­dent in my mind later that night, I re­alised how con­de­scend­ing my at­ti­tude to­wards my friend had be­come right af­ter she made that state­ment. I had be­gun, in my head, to treat her like some­body to be ed­u­cated; or worse, even started to view her as a wrong to be cor­rected. How pa­tro­n­is­ing of me, and worse, what a de­hu­man­is­ing way to treat an­other per­son.</p>
    <p>But what is a bet­ter way to think about the sit­u­a­tion?</p>
    <p>How can we move past this es­sen­tial­ist con­ver­sa­tion – about who is wrong and who is right, who is racist and who is not, and whether cer­tain groups have in­nate char­ac­ter­is­tics – a con­ver­sa­tion that it­self smacks of clas­sism?</p>
    <p>It bears think­ing through whether our opin­ions on such is­sues vary across gen­er­a­tions. Speak­ing at the open­ing of an on­line di­a­logue or­gan­ised by OnePeo­ple.sg back in July, Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shanmugam said that while older Sin­ga­pore­ans are less com­fort­able dis­cussing race is­sues in pub­lic, younger Sin­ga­pore­ans are more will­ing to have such con­ver­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>My view is that while this is true, stereo­types have, for many, be­come a safe and even funny or en­ter­tain­ing way to talk about race.</p>
    <p>What caught me about what my friend said was how she framed her com­ment as a joke – some­thing that was meant to be funny be­cause it was “true”.</p>
    <p>Com­mon in local hu­mour such as in the work of stand-up co­me­dian Ku­mar and others, stereo­types about racial be­hav­iour and pref­er­ences are a way to cope with the ex­is­ten­tial threat to the foun­da­tional fab­ric of our so­ci­ety that larger ques­tions pose. A sani­ti­sa­tion of un­com­fort­able thoughts cre­ated by an un­com­fort­able sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>If you don’t like the smell of what your neigh­bour is cook­ing, make it into an eth­nic joke in­stead of a fight about food and cul­ture, and space, and the very air we breathe.</p>
    <p>In the face of such a threat, the dis­cus­sion and man­age­ment of large-scale race re­la­tions were taken over by the state – “se­cu­ri­tised” – which is to say re­moved from pub­lic dis­course and treated as a mat­ter of na­tional se­cu­rity. Pol­icy moves like hav­ing an eth­nic quota in pub­lic hous­ing were ac­cepted by the pop­u­la­tion as nec­es­sary to the sur­vival of the coun­try and not open for dis­cus­sion.</p>
    <p>Grow­ing up in an era of rel­a­tive calm, younger Sin­ga­pore­ans are, I be­lieve, more in­clined to talk, to lis­ten and to process what ap­pear to be more sur­face dif­fer­ences be­tween eth­nic groups as op­posed to em­pha­sis­ing com­mon­al­ity for the sake of peace.</p>
    <p>I be­lieve that the dif­fer­ence be­tween my friend and me, be­tween older and younger Sin­ga­pore­ans, is that younger Sin­ga­pore­ans are more will­ing to in­ter­pret racial stereo­typ­ing as a form of vi­o­lence in­stead of fuel for hu­mour.</p>
    <p>Yes, vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>To many peo­ple, vi­o­lence pre­sumes in­jury, and if in­jury comes with no blood, it be­comes dif­fi­cult to iden­tify, slip­pery. But harm is nev­er­the­less done.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ous gen­er­a­tions who grew up with the spec­tre of phys­i­cal vi­o­lence in the form of the race ri­ots of the 1960s are hy­per­vig­i­lant in main­tain­ing racial har­mony.</p>
    <p>Younger ones brought up in a dif­fer­ent era in­ter­nalise such con­cerns over un­rest, and have in fact ex­tended their con­cern over racial re­la­tions to see­ing and feel­ing that vi­o­lence to har­mony is not nec­es­sar­ily phys­i­cal, but can also be psy­cho­log­i­cal.</p>
    <p>In­jury pre­sumes dam­age. If we look for what is hurt by stereo­types, we can un­der­stand what the vi­o­lence is.</p>
    <p>Stereo­types dam­age and de­stroy what is in­te­gral yet in­vis­i­ble to the per­son – the sense of per­son­al­ity and self, of com­plex­ity and in­di­vid­u­al­ity.</p>
    <p>I be­lieve that racial stereo­types of the kind we hear about in Sin­ga­pore dam­age not only the vic­tim, but the ag­gres­sor as well.</p>
    <p>To see how, we must un­pack the dis­course.</p>
    <p>The phrase my friend used – “class full of (a cer­tain race)” – con­flates eth­nic iden­tity with ed­u­ca­tional achieve­ment, in­sin­u­at­ing a link be­tween race and in­tel­li­gence, or at least work ethic.</p>
    <p>Such links are typ­i­cal of colo­nial per­spec­tives. In an in­flu­en­tial work in 1977 ti­tled The Myth Of The Lazy Na­tive, Malaysian so­ci­ol­o­gist Syed Hus­sein Alatas traced how the colo­nial au­thor­i­ties per­pet­u­ated the idea of “the in­do­lent, dull, back­ward and treach­er­ous na­tive”, need­ing colo­nial as­sis­tance to progress, in or­der to jus­tify their rule.</p>
    <p>Such ideas shaped gen­er­a­tions. The stereo­types con­tinue to live on in many of our views, whether we are aware of them or not.</p>
    <p>Such views as­sume a racial hi­er­ar­chy ex­pressed here in terms of ed­u­ca­tional achieve­ment.</p>
    <p>Like all hi­er­ar­chies, this one re­lies on an “oth­er­ing”, an as­ser­tion of dif­fer­ence be­tween the in-group and out-group.</p>
    <p>These bound­aries are not in­her­ently evil. Bound­aries of race give a sense of be­long­ing, of iden­tity and cul­ture. They are in­te­gral to who we are and how we in­ter­face with the world.</p>
    <p>But strictly de­fined group iden­tity is only one way to un­der­stand our­selves and the world, and one that most of us rarely ever use in iso­la­tion. Most of us con­stantly jug­gle mul­ti­ple iden­ti­ties. We are Sin­ga­porean, and also Malay, Chi­nese, In­dian. We may be boomers, mil­len­ni­als or Gen Z. Stereo­typ­ing re­quires us to forget our own com­plex­ity – which di­min­ishes and dam­ages the self.</p>
    <p>If our ideas of bound­aries, and the traits peo­ple have, con­tinue to be drawn from the past, from sets of ideas used to di­vide and con­quer our an­ces­tors, and per­pet­u­ated by ig­no­rance and thought­less­ness, we will con­tinue to ex­act their vi­o­lence upon our present.</p>
    <p>Racial stereo­types are old, and now no­body is laugh­ing. We have to grow beyond them and leave them where they be­long, in the past.</p>
    <p>Younger Sin­ga­pore­ans are more will­ing to in­ter­pret racial stereo­typ­ing as a form of vi­o­lence in­stead of fuel for hu­mour... Pre­vi­ous gen­er­a­tions who grew up with the spec­tre of phys­i­cal vi­o­lence in the form of the race ri­ots of the 1960s are hy­per­vig­i­lant in main­tain­ing racial har­mony. Younger ones brought up in a dif­fer­ent era in­ter­nalise such con­cerns over un­rest, and have in fact ex­tended their con­cern over racial re­la­tions to see­ing and feel­ing that vi­o­lence to har­mony is not nec­es­sar­ily phys­i­cal, but can also be psy­cho­log­i­cal.</p>
