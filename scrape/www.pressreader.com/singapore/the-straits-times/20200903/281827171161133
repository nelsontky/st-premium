    <p>BANGKOK • Thai­land has re­ported zero lo­cally trans­mit­ted Covid-19 cases for 100 days in a row, join­ing a small group of places such as Tai­wan where the pathogen has been vir­tu­ally elim­i­nated.</p>
    <p>The South-east Asian coun­try has not recorded any com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion since May 26, data from the health min­istry yes­ter­day showed.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties are still find­ing in­fec­tions among trav­ellers ar­riv­ing at the tourist hot spot’s bor­ders, but these peo­ple are quar­an­tined and al­lowed into the com­mu­nity only af­ter they have re­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>Like in the case of Tai­wan and New Zealand, an­other lo­ca­tion that made it past 100 days be­fore lo­cal in­fec­tions re-emerged, Thai­land’s suc­cess has re­lied on strictly po­liced bor­ders that have been closed to for­eign­ers for months.</p>
    <p>The strat­egy has come at great cost to Thai­land, with its iconic beaches and cul­tural sites mak­ing it one of the most tourism-re­liant economies in the world.</p>
    <p>That makes the mile­stone a bit­ter­sweet one for the coun­try, com­ing amid grow­ing pres­sure from busi­ness to re­open bor­ders to save the ail­ing tourism sec­tor, which ac­counted for 20 per cent of Thai­land’s pre-pan­demic econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has in prin­ci­ple agreed to open to tourists again ahead of the north­ern hemi­sphere win­ter, but has yet to release many de­tails about how it will do so safely.</p>
    <p>“We con­tained the virus, and now is re­ally the time to fo­cus on the econ­omy – the longer we close the bor­ders, the more dam­age it will have,” said Mr Som­prawin Man­prasert, chief econ­o­mist at Bank of Ayud­hya in Bangkok. “With­out proper poli­cies, the exit of some busi­nesses and work­forces could cut the coun­try’s long-term growth by 0.5 per cent each year.”</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the gov­ern­ment an­nounced 68.5 bil­lion baht (S$2.98 bil­lion) worth of fis­cal stim­u­lus in cash hand­outs and job mea­sures to sup­port the econ­omy. This in­cludes spend­ing 45 bil­lion baht on 3,000 baht hand­outs for 15 mil­lion peo­ple to boost do­mes­tic con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>Thai­land’s dilemma il­lus­trates the dif­fi­cult bal­ance gov­ern­ments across the world are try­ing to strike between pub­lic health and eco­nomic sur­vival.</p>
    <p>While many coun­tries quickly shut down to curb the virus’ spread ear­lier this year, the eco­nomic fall­out soon be­came too much to bear, and places from the United States to In­dia pushed to re­open de­spite the virus con­tin­u­ing to run ram­pant, fuelling new spikes in in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Thai­land’s 100-day feat is all the more im­pres­sive given that it was the first coun­try out­side China to de­tect the coro­n­avirus, on Jan 13.</p>
    <p>The king­dom has so far re­ported 3,425 cases and 58 fa­tal­i­ties, with only 93 pa­tients still be­ing treated in hospi­tals.</p>
