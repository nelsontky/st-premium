    <p>WASH­ING­TON • With coron­avirus cases in the United States near­ing five mil­lion and over 160,000 deaths so far, gov­er­nors from both Repub­li­can and Demo­cratic par­ties, who are frus­trated by the lack of fed­eral lead­er­ship, are try­ing to forge a na­tional coron­avirus test­ing pro­gramme with­out the White House’s help.</p>
    <p>The seven-state ef­fort to buy more than three mil­lion coron­avirus anti­gen tests was born of need and dis­ap­point­ment. It was mid­wifed by the Rock­e­feller Foun­da­tion and Mary­land Gov­er­nor Larry Ho­gan, and skirts Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion, even if many gov­er­nors would pre­fer an ap­proach co­or­di­nated by the fed­eral gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The foun­da­tion will help marshal funds, and the gov­er­nors – four Democrats and three Repub­li­cans – aim to re­cruit more states, as­sur­ing test-makers of the big­gest pos­si­ble mar­ket and fill­ing a vac­uum left by fed­eral in­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>The group com­prises Louisiana, Mary­land, Mas­sachusetts, Michi­gan, Ohio, North Carolina and Vir­ginia, and the states are al­ready in dis­cus­sions with test man­u­fac­tur­ers Bec­ton, Dick­in­son & Co and Quidel Corp. The tests can de­liver re­sults in 15 to 20 min­utes.</p>
    <p>“The states are lead­ing Amer­ica’s na­tional re­sponse to Covid-19,” said Vir­ginia Gov­er­nor Ralph Northam, a Demo­crat. “We are bring­ing to­gether this bi­par­ti­san, multi-state coali­tion to com­bine our pur­chas­ing power and get rapid-test­ing sup­plies to our com­mu­ni­ties as quickly as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>The agree­ment is a sig­nif­i­cant re­proach to the ad­min­is­tra­tion, which has failed to for­mu­late a co­her­ent na­tional plan to fight the dis­ease that has, at times, left states com­pet­ing for sup­plies.</p>
    <p>It brings to­gether politi­cians of dif­fer­ent par­ties, de­spite Mr Trump’s ef­fort to sow dis­sent be­fore the Novem­ber elec­tion. And it comes in part­ner­ship with an elite char­ity that is a bas­tion of the Amer­i­can estab­lish­ment.</p>
    <p>“This ap­pears to be a joint re­buke based in joint ex­as­per­a­tion,” said</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Dan Sch­nur, who teaches po­lit­i­cal com­mu­ni­ca­tions at the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia at Berke­ley and the Univer­sity of South­ern Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>Al­though many states this spring tried to co­or­di­nate their ap­proaches to fight­ing the pan­demic and re­open­ing their economies, those ef­forts fell short of pool­ing re­sources to buy badly needed tests.</p>
    <p>“Shared com­mu­ni­ca­tions and co­or­di­na­tion is one thing, but a joint fi­nan­cial com­mit­ment i n the ab­sence of fed­eral ac­tion is some­thing else,” Prof Sch­nur said.</p>
    <p>Mr Ho­gan, the Repub­li­can gov­er­nor of a blue state and the out­go­ing chair­man of the Na­tional Gov­er­nors As­so­ci­a­tion, has openly crit­i­cised Mr Trump’s han­dling of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But at an evening news brief­ing, Mr Trump said his ad­min­is­tra­tion has in­creased the scale and qual­ity of test­ing. He said of­fi­cials have been work­ing with gov­er­nors and that there have been “no com­plaints from any of them”.</p>
