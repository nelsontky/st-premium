    <p>French ac­tor Ger­ard Depar­dieu (left) will face a new rape in­ves­ti­ga­tion in France, af­ter pros­e­cu­tors re­opened a case into al­le­ga­tions he as­saulted a woman dur­ing cast­ing try­outs at his Paris man­sion, sources close to the case said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Depar­dieu’s ac­cuser, an ac­tress in her 20s who can­not be iden­ti­fied for le­gal rea­sons, said the ac­tor as­saulted and raped her dur­ing two separate try­outs in Au­gust 2018.</p>
    <p>The 71-year-old star of the As­terix And Obe­lix films (1999 to 2012) has al­ready been ques­tioned by the po­lice over the claims and saw the case dropped in June last year, when pros­e­cu­tors de­cided they lacked suf­fi­cient ev­i­dence to pur­sue a trial.</p>
    <p>That prompted his ac­cuser to file a new com­plaint that in­cluded civil pro­ceed­ings, which un­der French law al­most al­ways leads to a case be­ing ex­am­ined anew by an in­ves­ti­gat­ing mag­is­trate.</p>
    <p>A ju­di­cial source said a new judge was ap­pointed in Au­gust to rein­ves­ti­gate the case.</p>
    <p>Depar­dieu’s lawyer Herve Temime said he had not been in­formed of the new in­ves­ti­ga­tion, but called it a “non-event, as it is an au­to­matic de­ci­sion” to ap­point an in­ves­ti­gat­ing mag­is­trate.</p>
    <p>Depar­dieu has de­nied the al­le­ga­tions, which came in the wake of the #MeToo move­ment sparked by the rape and as­sault claims against dis­graced Hol­ly­wood mogul Har­vey We­in­stein.</p>
    <p>The ac­tor, who has made more than 180 films, is one of the best-known faces in French cin­ema, through films such as Cyrano De Berg­erac (1990), for which he was nom­i­nated for an Os­car.</p>
    <p>He has starred along­side ac­tresses i nclud­ing Cather­ine Deneuve and Kate Winslet, and played the su­per­hu­man Gaul in the As­terix And Obe­lix films.</p>
    <p>In 2013, he prompted out­rage at home af­ter tak­ing Rus­sian cit­i­zen­ship in a protest against France’s pro­posed tax hike on the ul­tra-wealthy.</p>
