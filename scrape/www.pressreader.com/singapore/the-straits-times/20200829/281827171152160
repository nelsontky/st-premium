    <p>• Aus­tralia’s sec­ond most pop­u­lous state – the epi­cen­tre of the coun­try’s lat­est Covid-19 out­break – said yes­ter­day it ex­pects to soon re­port just dou­ble-digit daily rises in new in­fec­tions, as a strin­gent lock­down slows the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria state said it de­tected 113 new cases in the past 24 hours, un­changed from the pre­vi­ous day, and well be­low the one-day record of 725 cases re­ported early this month.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties said they expect case numbers to fall be­low 100 as soon as the week­end, four weeks into a six-week hard lock­down of around five mil­lion peo­ple in the state cap­i­tal, Mel­bourne.</p>
    <p>“It’s not got­ten be­low 100 (per day) yet. I do expect that to hap­pen, if not over the week­end, then by next week,” Vic­to­ria state chief health of­fi­cer Brett Sut­ton told re­porters in Mel­bourne. “It is help­ful from a psy­cho­log­i­cal point of view.”</p>
    <p>Other Aus­tralian states have closed their bor­ders to Vic­to­ria, a mea­sure that the au­thor­i­ties be­lieve has stopped a na­tion­wide sec­ond wave.</p>
    <p>Still Aus­tralia’s most pop­u­lous state, New South Wales, yes­ter­day said it has found 13 new cases, the big­gest one-day rise in cases since Aug 13.</p>
    <p>Queens­land state was the only other state to re­port new in­fec­tions, with three cases de­tected in the past 24 hours.</p>
    <p>Else­where the virus has been ef­fec­tively elim­i­nated.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has now recorded nearly 25,500 Covid-19 in­fec­tions, while the death toll rose to 584 af­ter 12 peo­ple died in Vic­to­ria.</p>
    <p>In neigh­bour­ing New Zealand, where a clus­ter emerged ear­lier this month af­ter more than 100 days with­out a com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion, of­fi­cials re­ported 12 new cases, seven of them peo­ple who re­turned from over­seas and are al­ready in quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>New Zealand now has just over 1,700 in­fec­tions, while 22 peo­ple have died of Covid-19.</p>
