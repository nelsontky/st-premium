    <p>Man­u­fac­tur­ing grew at a faster pace in Oc­to­ber in the fourth straight month of ex­pan­sion, sig­nalling re­cov­ery, said ex­perts. But they also cau­tioned that un­cer­tain­ties re­main, such as geopo­lit­i­cal ten­sions and the Covid-19 pan­demic, which has prompted fresh lock­downs.</p>
    <p>Man­u­fac­tur­ing grew at a quicker pace in Oc­to­ber in the fourth straight month of ex­pan­sion, sig­nalling re­cov­ery, said ex­perts. But they also cau­tioned that un­cer­tain­ties re­main, such as geopo­lit­i­cal ten­sions and the Covid-19 pan­demic which has prompted fresh lock­downs.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Pur­chas­ing Man­agers’ In­dex (PMI) – a key mea­sure of ac­tiv­ity – edged up 0.2 point in Oc­to­ber from the pre­vi­ous month to record a faster ex­pan­sion at 50.5. This is the high­est read­ing since March last year when it was 50.8. A read­ing above 50 in­di­cates ex­pan­sion; one be­low that num­ber points to con­trac­tion.</p>
    <p>The elec­tron­ics sec­tor posted growth for the third straight month, with a slight in­crease of 0.1 point to record an ex­pan­sion at 51. This is the high­est read­ing since Septem­ber 2018 when it was 51.4.</p>
    <p>Last month’s man­u­fac­tur­ing growth was at­trib­uted to faster ex­pan­sion rates in the in­dexes of new or­ders, new ex­ports and fac­tory out­put, noted the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Pur­chas­ing and Ma­te­ri­als Man­age­ment (SIPMM), which pub­lishes the monthly PMI read­ings.</p>
    <p>But the in­ven­tory in­dex recorded a slower rate of ex­pan­sion whereas the in­dexes of both em­ploy­ment and sup­plier de­liv­er­ies recorded slower rates of con­trac­tion.</p>
    <p>The over­all em­ploy­ment in­dex has recorded con­trac­tions for nine con­sec­u­tive months. But the elec­tron­ics em­ploy­ment in­dex has shown a trend to­wards slower con­trac­tions since it first recorded a con­trac­tion in Fe­bru­ary this year, SIPMM noted. The lat­est read­ing of 49.8 sug­gested that the elec­tron­ics em­ploy­ment in­dex could pos­si­bly have hit the bot­tom and trend to­wards an ex­pan­sion.</p>
    <p>The over­all in­dexes of fin­ished goods, im­ports, in­put prices, and or­der back­log have all posted slightly faster rates of ex­pan­sion.</p>
    <p>Ms Sophia Poh, SIPMM’s vi­cepres­i­dent for in­dus­try en­gage­ment and developmen­t, said: “The Oc­to­ber PMI read­ing is an af­fir­ma­tion of the re­cov­ery for the over­all man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor.</p>
    <p>“How­ever man­u­fac­tur­ers are in­creas­ingly con­cerned about the un­cer­tain geopo­lit­i­cal de­vel­op­ments as well as new waves of the global pan­demic, which could dampen global de­mand and thus de­rail the man­u­fac­tur­ing re­cov­ery.”</p>
    <p>United Over­seas Bank econ­o­mist Barn­abas Gan said: “The higher read­ings in both man­u­fac­tur­ing and elec­tronic PMIs sig­nal that a re­cov­ery is tak­ing place, while re­cent high-fre­quency data points to­wards a rel­a­tively bet­ter eco­nomic en­vi­ron­ment in the fourth quar­ter.”</p>
    <p>He added that while hir­ing sen­ti­ments con­tin­ued to stay soft, there may be some nascent signs of a turn­around for labour de­mand in the fourth quar­ter as well.</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank’s head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy Se­lena Ling also warned of un­cer­tain­ties. “At this junc­ture, while the sup­plier de­liv­er­ies gauge for both the man­u­fac­tur­ing and elec­tron­ics sec­tors are both im­prov­ing, the or­der back­log in­dex is mixed for the man­u­fac­tur­ing and elec­tron­ics. This could mean some vul­ner­a­bil­ity to set­backs on the global de­mand front should resur­gent waves of Covid-19 in­fec­tions prompt fur­ther lo­calised lock­downs, as seen in the United King­dom, Ger­many and other parts of the world,” she said.</p>
    <p>She added that there could also be pro­tracted Amer­i­can election un­cer­tain­ties if there is no clear out­come, which could weigh on con­sumer and busi­ness con­fi­dence .</p>
    <p>“That said, it is also likely that the re­cent lock­downs seen in parts of Europe could ac­tu­ally trans­late into higher de­mand for China ex­ports as China has man­aged to con­tain the Covid-19 cri­sis well in re­cent months, and this could hope­fully see pos­i­tive spillover ef­fects into the rest of Asia too.”</p>
