    <p>WASH­ING­TON • US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has signed a mem­o­ran­dum that would pre­vent mi­grants who are in the United States il­le­gally from be­ing counted when US con­gres­sional vot­ing dis­tricts are next re­drawn, trig­ger­ing swift re­bukes from Democrats and threats of lit­i­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>US cen­sus experts and lawyers say the ac­tion is legally du­bi­ous, and not eas­ily ex­e­cuted in prac­tice.</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic-led states, in­clud­ing New York, and civil rights groups have al­ready vowed to mount a le­gal chal­lenge or said they are con­sid­er­ing it.</p>
    <p>If en­acted, the plan could ben­e­fit Mr Trump’s Repub­li­can Party by elim­i­nat­ing the largely non-white pop­u­la­tion of mi­grants who are in the US il­le­gally, cre­at­ing vot­ing dis­tricts that skew more Cau­casian.</p>
    <p>It could also cause pop­u­lous states with large im­mi­grant con­tin­gents to lose seats in the 435-mem­ber US House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives, in­clud­ing big left-lean­ing states like Cal­i­for­nia, cur­rently with 53 seats, and New York, with 27.</p>
    <p>The process of draw­ing vot­ing maps for fed­eral con­gres­sional dis­tricts is known as ap­por­tion­ment.</p>
    <p>“In­clud­ing th­ese il­le­gal aliens in the pop­u­la­tion of the state for the pur­pose of ap­por­tion­ment could re­sult in the al­lo­ca­tion of two or three more con­gres­sional seats than would oth­er­wise be al­lo­cated,” the memo said.</p>
    <p>Re­dis­trict­ing, in which vot­ing dis­tricts are re­drawn to re­flect changes in the pop­u­la­tion, is next slated for the fol­low­ing year, after the re­sults of the 2020 US cen­sus are in.</p>
    <p>Each state will be given a share of the 435 con­gres­sional seats based on pop­u­la­tion. His­tor­i­cally, the dis­tri­bu­tion of seats has been based on to­tal pop­u­la­tion, re­gard­less of im­mi­gra­tion sta­tus. Mr Trump’s memo on Tues­day would ex­clude those who are not in the coun­try legally.</p>
    <p>US House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a state­ment that the mea­sure was “un­law­ful” and was “de­signed to again in­ject fear and dis­trust into vul­ner­a­ble and tra­di­tion­ally un­der­counted com­mu­ni­ties, while sow­ing chaos with the cen­sus”.</p>
    <p>From a le­gal stand­point, the move is far from a slam dunk. Pro­po­nents of cit­i­zens-only vot­ing dis­tricts ar­gue that each vote should carry the same weight. If one dis­trict has far fewer el­i­gi­ble vot­ers than an­other, they say, each vote there has more in­flu­ence on elec­tion out­comes.</p>
    <p>But while the US Supreme Court has left the door open for cit­i­zen­based vot­ing maps for state leg­is­la­tures, experts see it as a long shot at the fed­eral con­gres­sional level.</p>
    <p>That is be­cause the US Con­sti­tu­tion ex­plic­itly says con­gres­sional dis­tricts must be based on “the whole num­ber of per­sons” in each dis­trict, as counted in each de­cen­nial US cen­sus.</p>
    <p>Mr Dale Ho, an at­tor­ney with the Amer­i­can Civil Lib­er­ties Union, vowed lit­i­ga­tion. Re­fer­ring to the Pres­i­dent, he said in a state­ment: “We’ll see him in court, and win.”</p>
    <p>New York At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Leti­tia James, who helped lead a coali­tion of states that suc­cess­fully chal­lenged Mr Trump’s at­tempt to add a cit­i­zen­ship ques­tion to the cen­sus, made a sim­i­lar threat.</p>
    <p>She said: “We will con­tinue to lead this fight be­cause we will not al­low the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s anti-im­mi­grant poli­cies to tip the balance of power in the na­tion.”</p>
    <p>The word “per­sons”, Mr Trump said in the memo, “has never been un­der­stood to in­clude... ev­ery in­di­vid­ual phys­i­cally present within a state’s bound­aries”.</p>
    <p>In fact, it has, cen­sus experts say. Pro­fes­sor Joshua Geltzer, a con­sti­tu­tional law ex­pert from Ge­orge­town Law, said mul­ti­ple fed­eral laws have re­in­forced that ap­por­tion­ment must in­clude ev­ery­one, and US Supreme Court prece­dent has en­dorsed that view.</p>
