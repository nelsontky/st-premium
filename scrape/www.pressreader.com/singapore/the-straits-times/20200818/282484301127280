    <p>With the Covid-19 pan­demic hav­ing driven au­di­ences out of the­atres, the fu­ture of the per­form­ing arts looks bleak. But a new lo­cal digital plat­form could change that.</p>
    <p>The Fu­ture Stage, a 360-de­gree live-stream tech­nol­ogy de­vel­oped by home-grown the­atre com­pany Sight Lines En­ter­tain­ment and tech start-up Xc­tu­al­ity, aims to re­pro­duce the the­atri­cal ex­pe­ri­ence dig­i­tally.</p>
    <p>“What we have done here is recre­ate the ex­pe­ri­ence of go­ing to the the­atre,” said lo­cal play­wright and di­rec­tor Chong Tze Chien, 45, the project’s artis­tic di­rec­tor, at a Zoom launch last Wednesday.</p>
    <p>He walked view­ers through a demon­stra­tion us­ing the Vic­to­ria The­atre. On their screens, au­di­ences can hang out in the the­atre foyer read­ing vir­tual in­for­ma­tion about the play, chat with the frontof-house man­ager and even sneak a peek at the ac­tors get­ting ready in their dress­ing rooms.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the show, they can tog­gle be­tween a va­ri­ety of cam­era an­gles around the the­atre, in­clud­ing the stage. The tech­nol­ogy makes use of 360-de­gree cam­eras with vir­tu­a­land aug­mented-re­al­ity func­tions that can be used to cre­ate choice­based narratives. This sets it apart from ex­ist­ing plat­forms such as YouTube and Face­book Live, where au­di­ences usu­ally have no con­trol over their an­gles or per­spec­tives.</p>
    <p>It can run con­cur­rently with an on-site au­di­ence – with or with­out so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures – should com­pa­nies want to com­ple­ment a phys­i­cal sea­son with a vir­tual one that can run for an ex­tended pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria The­atre has a tra­di­tional prosce­nium stage, but the devel­op­ers stressed that the tech­nol­ogy can be adapted to all sorts of pro­duc­tions – a per­for­mance in the round, a site-spe­cific work or even a her­itage trail.</p>
    <p>Sight Lines En­ter­tain­ment’s ex­ec­u­tive pro­ducer Der­rick Chew, 34, said many the­atre com­pa­nies are ques­tion­ing if it makes eco­nomic sense to in­vest in stage pro­duc­tions now, when safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures would ul­ti­mately re­duce au­di­ence ca­pac­ity and, in turn, rev­enue.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery plan has been thrown out the win­dow be­cause of the pan­demic, but I think now we have a so­lu­tion,” he added. “We strongly be­lieve The Fu­ture Stage is go­ing to be a game changer.”</p>
    <p>The idea was con­ceived in June when Xc­tu­al­ity co-founders War­ren Woon and Adrian Oliveiro watched a pre­view of Chong’s show, Mur­der At Mandai Camp, an in­ter­ac­tive who­dunit that un­folded over Zoom and mes­sag­ing app Tele­gram. In­trigued, they met Chong and Chew.</p>
    <p>Xc­tu­al­ity pro­vides e-tick­et­ing and smart event so­lu­tions. Its clients have in­cluded For­mula One Sin­ga­pore Grand Prix, Streats Food Fes­ti­val and this year’s Na­tional Day Pa­rade.</p>
    <p>The Fu­ture Stage’s pro­duc­tion tech­nol­ogy is ready for use, while the tick­et­ing and stream­ing plat­form will be avail­able from Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>The team will pro­vide free con­sul­ta­tions to arts com­pa­nies on how to adopt the tech­nol­ogy, which aims to be a one-stop plat­form for tick­et­ing, ad­ver­tise­ment place­ments, mer­chan­dise sales and pos­si­bly au­di­ence an­a­lyt­ics.</p>
    <p>Asked how much this would cost com­pa­nies, Chong and Chew said it would be hard to es­ti­mate as it would de­pend on each pro­duc­tion’s scale and bud­get.</p>
    <p>Chong reck­oned, how­ever, that it would not cost more than 50 per cent of what com­pa­nies would nor­mally pay for pro­duc­ing archival videos of their works.</p>
    <p>Chew also pointed out that they save on the ad­di­tional cost of rent­ing a phys­i­cal the­atre space for the en­tire sea­son: “With the stream­ing plat­form, you can have a vir­tual sea­son that can last months.”</p>
    <p>Theatremak­er Zelda Tatiana Ng, 51, is considerin­g try­ing out the plat­form for a new pro­duc­tion by her the­atre col­lec­tive GroundZ-0, which will re­quire au­di­ences to ob­serve play­ers from many per­spec­tives.</p>
    <p>Though the plat­form can­not re­place the phys­i­cal the­atre ex­pe­ri­ence for her, its one-stop na­ture at­tracted her.</p>
    <p>“We’re a very small com­pany. If I can pay some­one and he or she can do ev­ery­thing for me pro­fes­sion­ally, it would be a con­ve­nient way to do it,” she said. “This is the new nor­mal and there are so many things we’re adapt­ing to and learning. I’m sure this team is still fig­ur­ing it out. The more it does it, the more ex­pe­ri­enced it will be.”</p>
