    <p>SEOUL • A South Korean court yes­ter­day or­dered the Ja­panese gov­ern­ment to pay com­pen­sa­tion to 12 World War II sex slaves or their fam­i­lies, in an un­prece­dented rul­ing that has in­fu­ri­ated Tokyo.</p>
    <p>The Seoul Cen­tral District Court said Ja­pan should pay the vic­tims 100 mil­lion won (S$121,000) each, South Korea’s Yon­hap news agency re­ported.</p>
    <p>It is the first civil­ian le­gal case in South Korea against Tokyo by wartime sex slaves or “com­fort women” for Ja­panese troops.</p>
    <p>The rul­ing comes de­spite a 1965 treaty be­tween Seoul and Tokyo which de­clared that claims be­tween them and their na­tion­als had been set­tled.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s Chief Cab­i­net Sec­re­tary Kat­sunobu Kato called the ver­dict “un­ac­cept­able”, urg­ing Seoul to make an “ap­pro­pri­ate re­sponse”.</p>
    <p>Tokyo’s For­eign Min­istry sum­moned South Korean Am­bas­sador to Ja­pan Nam Gwan-pyo to lodge a com­plaint.</p>
    <p>The court ver­dict said Im­pe­rial Ja­pan was re­spon­si­ble for the “com­fort women” sys­tem. “The plain­tiffs, who were in their late teens or early 20s, were sub­jected to re­peated sex­ual ex­ploita­tion. It amounted to an il­le­gal act against hu­man­ity and the de­fen­dant has an obli­ga­tion to com­pen­sate the vic­tims for their men­tal suf­fer­ing.”</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s rul­ing came in a le­gal process that be­gan eight years ago and sev­eral of the orig­i­nal plain­tiffs have since died, to be re­placed by fam­ily mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Tokyo, which boy­cotted the pro­ceed­ing, in­sists all com­pen­sa­tion is­sues stem­ming from its colo­nial rule were set­tled in a 1965 treaty and linked agree­ment nor­mal­is­ing diplo­matic re­la­tions be­tween the neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>Un­der them, Ja­pan paid South Korea fi­nan­cial repa­ra­tions – which Seoul used to con­trib­ute to its trans­for­ma­tion into an eco­nomic pow­er­house – and the doc­u­ment said that claims be­tween the states and their na­tion­als had been “set­tled com­pletely and fi­nally”.</p>
    <p>But the court ruled that the agree­ment did not end the women’s right to seek com­pen­sa­tion from Tokyo, which it said bore li­a­bil­ity for their suf­fer­ing decades ago.</p>
    <p>“I am deeply moved by to­day’s rul­ing,” said Mr Kim Kang-won, the women’s lawyer. “It is the first such ver­dict for vic­tims who suf­fered at the hands of Ja­panese troops,” he said, in­sist­ing that at the time of the 1965 treaty, “the is­sue of com­fort women was not dis­cussed at all”.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese gov­ern­ment de­nies it is di­rectly re­spon­si­ble for the wartime abuses, in­sist­ing that the vic­tims were re­cruited by civil­ians and that the mil­i­tary broth­els were com­mer­cially op­er­ated.</p>
    <p>The dis­pute has fes­tered de­spite the treaty, and Seoul and Tokyo reached a deal in 2015 aimed at “fi­nally and ir­re­versibly” re­solv­ing it with a Ja­panese apol­ogy and the for­ma­tion of a one bil­lion yen (S$12.77 mil­lion) fund for sur­vivors.</p>
    <p>But the gov­ern­ment of Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in de­clared the agree­ment reached un­der his con­ser­va­tive pre­de­ces­sor faulty and ef­fec­tively nul­li­fied it, cit­ing the lack of vic­tims’ con­sent.</p>
    <p>The move led to a bit­ter diplo­matic dis­pute that spread to af­fect trade and se­cu­rity ties.</p>
    <p>The same court is due to rule next week on a sim­i­lar case brought against Tokyo by an­other 20 women and their fam­i­lies.</p>
