    <p>A 28-year-old man was sen­tenced to seven weeks’ jail yes­ter­day for film­ing a 25-year-old col­league in a women’s toi­let in­side their of­fice build­ing.</p>
    <p>Gabriel Lim Wei Hng had sneaked into the women’s toi­let af­ter hear­ing women talk­ing there, while on his way out of the ad­ja­cent men’s toi­let.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, he pleaded guilty in court to one charge of in­sult­ing a woman’s mod­esty and an­other charge of crim­i­nal tres­pass re­lat­ing to the in­ci­dent that oc­curred on July 18 last year.</p>
    <p>An ad­di­tional four charges re­lat­ing to two sim­i­lar prior in­ci­dents were taken into con­sid­er­a­tion dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>Deputy Public Pros­e­cu­tor Lim Shin Hui told the court that Lim had “wanted to take a video of a woman us­ing the toi­let”, when he heard fe­male voices com­ing out of it.</p>
    <p>He went to the cu­bi­cle near­est to the en­trance and filmed the vic­tim re­liev­ing her­self in it by hold­ing his mo­bile phone over the top of the cu­bi­cle, said DPP Lim.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim was then in a state of un­dress and shouted when she no­ticed the mo­bile phone.</p>
    <p>“The ac­cused pan­icked, re­tracted the mo­bile phone and ex­ited the fe­male toi­let. He then went to the male toi­let to delete the video that he had recorded of the vic­tim and there­after pro­ceeded back to his of­fice,” said DPP Lim.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the vic­tim and a wit­ness, who was in the toi­let at the time, re­ported the in­ci­dent to the se­cu­rity of­fice. They re­viewed closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion footage show­ing the cor­ri­dor out­side the toi­let and recog­nised Lim as a fel­low em­ployee, she said.</p>
    <p>In mit­i­ga­tion, Lim’s de­fence coun­sel Fa­vian Kang said Lim’s crime was a “spur of the mo­ment” de­ci­sion and that he was gen­uinely re­morse­ful and made no ex­cuses for his be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>He said that Lim’s crimes had a lower de­gree of in­tru­sion on the vic­tim’s pri­vacy as he had filmed the vic­tim from a “top-down” per­spec­tive and not by slid­ing the phone un­der the cu­bi­cle’s bot­tom open­ing.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Dis­trict Judge Marvin Bay said he was “not con­vinced that there is a valid dis­tinc­tion” for that. He noted that the mul­ti­ple in­ci­dents demon­strated more of an “es­tab­lished modus operandi” than an im­pul­sive urge to com­mit the of­fences.</p>
    <p>“Of­fences of this na­ture are un­for­tu­nately all too preva­lent and de­ter­rent sen­tences are there­fore called for,” said the judge.</p>
    <p>Lim will serve his sen­tence from Dec 14.</p>
