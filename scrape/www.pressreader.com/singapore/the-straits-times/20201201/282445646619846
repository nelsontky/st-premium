    <p>Liverpool man­ager Jur­gen Klopp says his mount­ing in­jury list ahead of to­day’s Cham­pi­ons League clash with Ajax means he does not have enough fit play­ers to ro­tate his squad.</p>
    <p>James Mil­ner is the lat­est player on the side­lines af­ter the util­ity man in­jured his ham­string in Satur­day’s Premier League draw at Brighton.</p>
    <p>Trent Alexan­der-Arnold has not yet been given the green light to re­turn to full train­ing, while fel­low de­fend­ers Vir­gil van Dijk and Joe Gomez are both out with longterm in­juries. Mid­field quar­tet Xher­dan Shaqiri, Alex OxladeCham­ber­lain as well as Naby Keita and Thi­ago Al­can­tara will also miss the game at An­field.</p>
    <p>Asked at his vir­tual pre-match press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day if fix­ture con­ges­tion meant he would have to pri­ori­tise be­tween Europe and the league, Klopp said he was in no po­si­tion to ro­tate his squad.</p>
    <p>“I don’t have enough play­ers to pri­ori­tise. It’s not about the com­pe­ti­tion it’s about the play­ers. On Satur­day, the fittest play­ers played,” the Ger­man added.</p>
    <p>On his ever-grow­ing in­jury list, Klopp ap­peared re­signed de­spite his re­cent rants at broad­cast­ers BT Sport and Sky Sports for sched­ul­ing early kick-offs the past two Satur­days af­ter play­ing in the Cham­pi­ons League in mid­week.</p>
    <p>“It’s not a per­fect sit­u­a­tion but ob­vi­ously, not enough peo­ple want to of­fer us any kind of help (with the fix­ture sched­ul­ing), not only for us but for (all) foot­ball peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“We just have to deal with it,” he said. “I said it al­ways – as long as we can line up with 11 play­ers, we will fight with all we have and that’s still the case.”</p>
    <p>He also went into de­tail re­gard­ing Thi­ago’s in­jury for the first time. The Spain in­ter­na­tional was poleaxed by Richarli­son in the Mersey­side derby on Oct 17.</p>
    <p>The Ever­ton for­ward was sent off for that and Klopp ex­pressed his un­hap­pi­ness at how bad the £25 mil­lion (S$44.7 mil­lion) sign­ing from Bay­ern Mu­nich, who has not played since, was hurt.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to lo­cal daily Liverpool Echo, Thi­ago, who has made just two ap­pear­ances for his new club, is un­likely to play again this year. Klopp re­vealed he suf­fered a “mas­sive im­pact” to his knee.</p>
    <p>He said: “That day when Thi­ago got in­jured in that chal­lenge in the Ever­ton game, there was an­other bad in­jury (to van Dijk) and af­ter the scans, it was like one was re­ally bad news and the other one was re­ally good news be­cause noth­ing was bro­ken, noth­ing was rup­tured.</p>
    <p>“The prob­lem is in a sit­u­a­tion like that, noth­ing is rup­tured, noth­ing is bro­ken and that means every­body thinks, ‘OK, you can go af­ter a few days’, but the im­pact on the leg was that big that it is still not OK. I can’t say ex­actly when he will be fine, but it will take a few weeks still with Thi­ago.”</p>
    <p>The Reds will go through to the knock­out stage from Group D if they avoid los­ing to Ajax and will be group win­ners if they win and Ata­lanta fail to beat Midtjyllan­d.</p>
    <p>I said it al­ways – as long as we can line up with 11 play­ers, we will fight with all we have and that’s still the case.</p>
