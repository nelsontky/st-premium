    <p>De­spite the im­pact of Covid-19 on global trade, Euro­pean Union im­ports from Sin­ga­pore saw a 12 per cent in­crease in the first six months since the EU-Sin­ga­pore Free Trade Agree­ment (EUSFTA) came into force.</p>
    <p>The EU del­e­ga­tion to Sin­ga­pore said in a state­ment yes­ter­day that this in­crease con­trasts with to­tal EU im­ports, which fell by 10.6 per cent in the same pe­riod of De­cem­ber to May.</p>
    <p>EU mer­chan­dise im­ports from Sin­ga­pore amounted to €9.7 bil­lion (S$15.8 bil­lion) dur­ing the six­month pe­riod, with or­ganic chem­i­cals and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal prod­ucts be­ing the two main prod­uct cat­e­gories im­ported into the EU from the Repub­lic.</p>
    <p>How­ever, EU ex­ports to Sin­ga­pore de­creased by 16 per cent to €12.5 bil­lion from De­cem­ber to May, com­pared with the same pe­riod a year ago, ow­ing to the neg­a­tive ef­fect of Covid-19 on the trade in goods.</p>
    <p>The EUSFTA came into force on Nov 21 last year.</p>
    <p>The EU re­moved 84 per cent of all its tar­iffs for goods orig­i­nat­ing in Sin­ga­pore, with ad­di­tional tar­iff re­duc­tions for the re­main­ing 16 per cent, while Sin­ga­pore elim­i­nated the last re­main­ing tar­iffs for al­co­holic bev­er­ages orig­i­nat­ing in the EU.</p>
    <p>Beer ex­ports from the re­gion to Sin­ga­pore have grown by 20 per cent since the trade agree­ment kicked in, the state­ment noted.</p>
    <p>EU Am­bas­sador to Sin­ga­pore Bar­bara Plink­ert said the ex­pan­sion of im­ports in EU from Sin­ga­pore demon­strates “a clear ev­i­dence of the ben­e­fits of the EUSFTA on tar­iff re­duc­tion and elim­i­na­tion for Sin­ga­pore ex­ports to the EU, de­spite the chal­leng­ing con­di­tions for in­ter­na­tional trade and sup­ply chains since the out­break of the cur­rent pandemic”.</p>
    <p>She en­cour­aged com­pa­nies, and es­pe­cially small and medium-sized en­ter­prises, to fur­ther tap the ben­e­fits of the agree­ment.</p>
    <p>The EU del­e­ga­tion to Sin­ga­pore state­ment also noted that Sin­ga­pore has yet to make use of the an­nual quota for goods with spe­cialised rules of ori­gin stip­u­lated in the EUSFTA.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic has not yet ex­ported any Asian food prod­ucts, such as sam­bal ikan bilis, samosas and dumplings, to the EU by us­ing the an­nual quota of 1,250 tonnes since the agree­ment came into ef­fect.</p>
