    <p>TOKYO • Just 21/ weeks into his 2 ten­ure as Ja­pan Prime Min­is­ter, a con­tro­versy is al­ready threat­en­ing to hurt Mr Yoshi­hide Suga’s sky­high ap­proval rat­ings.</p>
    <p>The prime min­is­ter is tasked with ap­point­ing schol­ars to the Ja­pan Sci­ence Coun­cil, which is set up within the gov­ern­ment but makes policy rec­om­men­da­tions in­de­pen­dent of it.</p>
    <p>This would or­di­nar­ily be a rub­ber-stamp process, with the names nom­i­nated by the coun­cil ap­proved by the prime min­is­ter. In a first, how­ever, Mr Suga re­jected six out of the 105 names sub­mit­ted this year, l ead­ing to an up­roar and claims that his gov­ern­ment is cur­tail­ing aca­demic free­doms.</p>
    <p>All six had crossed Mr Suga when he was chief Cab­i­net sec­re­tary by voic­ing op­po­si­tion to con­tro­ver­sial poli­cies in the past.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has re­fused to ex­plain why the six aca­demics were re­jected, de­spite calls for an ex­pla­na­tion by coun­cil pres­i­dent Takaaki Ka­jita, who won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2015.</p>
    <p>A mi­nor protest, at­tended by about 300 peo­ple, broke out in front of the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>But ob­servers also noted that the treat­ment is in line with Mr Suga’s rep­u­ta­tion as chief Cab­i­net sec­re­tary of de­mot­ing bu­reau­crats who did not see eye to eye with him.</p>
    <p>“The Suga ad­min­is­tra­tion does not seem very in­ter­ested in lib­er­al­ism, as seen from the re­fusal to ap­point the mem­bers,” Univer­sity of Tokyo po­lit­i­cal scientist Yu Uchiyama told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>But on the flip­side, Mr Suga’s hold on the bu­reau­cracy could make him more adept at bull­doz­ing through the re­forms he wants and un­do­ing prac­tices that are relics from Ja­pan’s heady bub­ble era.</p>
    <p>“I feel that the aware­ness of re­forms is quite strong,” Dr Sota Kato, a re­search di­rec­tor at The Tokyo Foun­da­tion for Policy Re­search think-tank, told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>“The new Prime Min­is­ter will put con­sid­er­able ef­fort into im­prov­ing pro­duc­tiv­ity through reg­u­la­tory re­forms.</p>
    <p>“He has the know-how and per­sonal con­nec­tions to elim­i­nate re­sis­tance from busi­nesses or other groups with vested in­ter­ests.”</p>
    <p>One of those lead­ing the charge is Ad­min­is­tra­tive Re­form Min­is­ter Taro Kono, a for­mer de­fence and for­eign min­is­ter, who wants to stamp out inkan or hanko seals and fax ma­chines, which re­main com­mon­place.</p>
    <p>Mr Kono also led the charge last year to switch the nam­ing or­der of Ja­panese names in English such that the fam­ily name is writ­ten first, to re­flect the way they are pre­sented in Ja­panese.</p>
    <p>In ar­gu­ing for a re­ver­sal of what has ef­fec­tively been gov­ern­ment policy since the Meiji era (1868 to 1912), Mr Kono said that Chi­nese and Korean names are writ­ten in English as they are read in their na­tive lan­guages.</p>
    <p>What this means is that “Yoshi­hide Suga” should, in fact, be writ­ten as “Suga Yoshi­hide”, though the prac­tice has been in­con­sis­tently adopted in the Ja­panese gov­ern­ment, let alone in the pri­vate sec­tor.</p>
    <p>But Mr Kono might well see more suc­cess with his push to elim­i­nate the seals and fax ma­chines, es­pe­cially with the push to go pa­per­less amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga has also named to the Cab­i­net Ja­pan’s first dig­i­tal min­is­ter, Mr Takuya Hi­rai, who was di­rected to set up a dig­i­tal agency to speed up the in­ef­fi­cient bu­reau­cracy.</p>
    <p>Mr Kono told a news con­fer­ence last month: “I don’t think there are that many ad­min­is­tra­tive pro­ce­dures that ac­tu­ally need print­ing out pa­per and fax­ing.</p>
    <p>“Why do we need to print pa­per? In many cases, it’s sim­ply be­cause the hanko stamp is re­quired. If we can put a stop to that cul­ture, it will elim­i­nate the need for pa­per, fax­ing and seals.”</p>
    <p>He then said in a tweet on Fri­day: “We checked 800 most of­ten used gov­ern­ment pro­ce­dures with hanko, or name stamp or seal, and found few of them need to con­tinue with hanko. This is the first step to make those pro­ce­dures on­line.”</p>
    <p>Ex­perts are split over the pos­si­bil­ity of suc­cess, un­less Mr Suga weighs in with his in­flu­ence.</p>
    <p>Dr Uchiyama told The Sun­day Times: “Mr Kono is very en­er­getic, but I think the re­sis­tance is strong.”</p>
    <p>Still, Dr Kato said: “In the case of the seals, there are i nter­est groups that are con­nected to LDP (the rul­ing Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party) mem­bers and have hin­dered re­forms.</p>
    <p>“But if it be­comes a ma­jor agenda, it will be a game of num­bers and the re­sis­tance of small in­ter­est groups can be over­come.”</p>
    <p>WELL-EQUIPPED</p>
    <p>The new Prime Min­is­ter will put con­sid­er­able ef­fort into im­prov­ing pro­duc­tiv­ity through reg­u­la­tory re­forms. He has the know-how and per­sonal con­nec­tions to elim­i­nate re­sis­tance from busi­nesses or ’’ other groups with vested in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>DR SOTA KATO, a re­search di­rec­tor at The Tokyo Foun­da­tion for Policy Re­search think-tank, told The Sun­day Times.</p>
