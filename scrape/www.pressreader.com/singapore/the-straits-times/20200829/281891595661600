    <p>The Philip­pines’ top diplo­mat yes­ter­day said he would back moves to end con­tracts with Chi­nese firms in­volved in recla­ma­tion projects in the South China Sea, tak­ing the lead from the United States.</p>
    <p>“If I find that any of those com­pa­nies are do­ing busi­ness with us, then I would strongly rec­om­mend ter­mi­nat­ing the re­la­tion­ship with that com­pany,” For­eign Min­is­ter Teodoro Loc­sin said in an in­ter­view aired by CNN Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion on Wed­nes­day added 24 Chi­nese com­pa­nies to a gov­ern­ment list that bans them from buy­ing Amer­i­can products and tech­nol­ogy, cit­ing their role in help­ing the Chi­nese mil­i­tary con­struct ar­ti­fi­cial is­lands in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude sub­sidiaries of con­struc­tion gi­ant China Com­mu­ni­ca­tions Con­struc­tion, which was awarded a con­tract to build an air­port south of the Philip­pine cap­i­tal Manila.</p>
    <p>“If they are in any way in­volved in the recla­ma­tion, then it be­comes con­sis­tent on our part to ter­mi­nate any con­tract with them,” said Mr Loc­sin. But he ac­knowl­edged that “they could sue us back”.</p>
    <p>China has been rapidly build­ing ar­ti­fi­cial is­lands in the South China Sea since 2013, dredg­ing and con­struct­ing more than 1,200ha of new land, in­clud­ing air de­fence and anti-ship mis­sile fea­tures.</p>
    <p>One of th­ese is­lands, on Subi reef, sits just 22km off Thitu is­land, the Philip­pines’ largest out­post in the Spratly is­land chain, in the south­ern half of the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>An­other one was built on Mischief reef, which is only 32km west of Sec­ond Thomas shoal, where a pla­toon of Filipino marines is sta­tioned in­side a World War II wreck the Philip­pines beached in 1999.</p>
    <p>Mischief reef is the clos­est Chi­nese-held po­si­tion to the main Philip­pine ar­chi­pel­ago at 210km, a dis­tance a fighter jet can cover in less than eight min­utes.</p>
    <p>Manila and Bei­jing have also been in a heated dis­pute over Scar­bor­ough shoal – a prime fish­ing site some 240km off the coast of the main Philip­pine is­land of Lu­zon – that China seized in 2012 af­ter a naval stand-off.</p>
    <p>China be­gan trans­form­ing reefs, shoals and atolls it oc­cu­pies in the dis­puted wa­ters into ar­ti­fi­cial is­lands shortly af­ter that stand-off.</p>
    <p>The stand-off had prompted Manila to file an un­prece­dented in­ter­na­tional le­gal chal­lenge against Bei­jing, ar­gu­ing that China’s so­called nine-dash line that marks its claims to nearly all of the South China Sea runs counter to in­ter­na­tional law.</p>
    <p>The tri­bunal in The Hague sided with the Philip­pines, and dis­missed China’s claims in 2016. But China re­fused to recog­nise that rul­ing.</p>
    <p>Last month, US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo of­fered an en­dorse­ment of that rul­ing and said Washington was recog­nis­ing the Philip­pines’ claims over Subi and Mischief reefs.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines’ For­eign Min­istry has lately taken a more de­fi­ant stand against Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, Mr Loc­sin said the coun­try would con­tinue pa­trolling the Spratlys, ig­nor­ing a warn­ing from China to stop “il­le­gal provo­ca­tions” in dis­puted wa­ters.</p>
    <p>Manila has also lodged a diplo­matic protest over what it said was China’s il­le­gal con­fis­ca­tion of fish ag­gre­gat­ing de­vices from Filipino fish­er­men at Scar­bor­ough shoal.</p>
    <p>It also protested against China’s “con­tin­u­ing il­licit is­suances of ra­dio chal­lenges (to) Philip­pine air­craft con­duct­ing le­git­i­mate reg­u­lar mar­itime pa­trols”.</p>
