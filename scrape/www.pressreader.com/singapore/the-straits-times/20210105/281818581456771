    <p>In­done­sia’s top ter­ror­ist con­vict Abu Bakar Bashir, the spir­i­tual leader of South-east Asia’s Je­maah Is­lamiah (JI) ter­ror group, is set to be re­leased from prison on Fri­day, the In­done­sian au­thor­i­ties said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The 82-year old rad­i­cal cleric has been in jail since his ar­rest in 2009.</p>
    <p>In 2011, he was sen­tenced to 15 years in jail for fund­ing a train­ing camp for ter­ror­ists in In­done­sia’s west­ern­most prov­ince of Aceh.</p>
    <p>Mr Imam Suyudi, the head of West Java’s law and hu­man rights re­gional of­fice, said Bashir will be re­leased from Gu­nung Sin­dur prison in Bo­gor on Fri­day af­ter ful­fill­ing his 15-year jail sen­tence, with re­mis­sion of 55 months.</p>
    <p>“He has served his pun­ish­ment well and fol­lowed all rules and pro­ce­dures,” Mr Imam was quoted as say­ing by An­tara.</p>
    <p>He also noted that Bashir is “in good shape” ahead of his re­lease.</p>
    <p>Bashir’s le­gal team had last year re­quested that the govern­ment pri</p>
    <p>ori­tise him for early re­lease along with other pris­on­ers on fears of a po­ten­tial coro­n­avirus out­break in pris­ons, cit­ing his old age as a fac­tor.</p>
    <p>Last April, In­done­sia set free 30,000 pris­on­ers who had served two-thirds of their sen­tences, in an ef­fort to pre­vent the spread of the coro­n­avirus in its over­crowded pris­ons.</p>
    <p>Bashir was the al­leged mas­ter­mind of In­done­sia’s dead­li­est ter­ror­ist at­tack – the 2002 bomb­ings on the re­sort is­land of Bali which killed 202 peo­ple. He was never con­victed of the at­tack.</p>
    <p>In De­cem­ber 2018, the In­done­sian cleric was of­fered early re­lease on hu­man­i­tar­ian grounds by the govern­ment due to his de­te­ri­o­rat­ing health.</p>
    <p>But it was on the con­di­tion that he had to first pledge al­le­giance to the Repub­lic of In­done­sia as well as state ide­ol­ogy Pan­casila, as is re­quired of all re­formed ter­ror­ists. Bashir re­fused the of­fer. Sep­a­rately, In­done­sia’s na­tional po­lice spokesman Ah­mad Ra­mad­han told re­porters that the po­lice would en­sure se­cu­rity and or­der on the day of Bashir’s re­lease.</p>
    <p>He added that they would also mon­i­tor Bashir’s move­ments af­ter he walks free.</p>
    <p>“That is not car­ried out only to­wards Abu Bakar Bashir. We have a spe­cial in­tel­li­gence team that mon­i­tors those who have com­mit­ted any crime,” he said.</p>
    <p>Bashir’s re­lease comes amid In­done­sian anti-ter­ror­ism squad Den­sus 88’s in­ten­si­fied ef­forts against ter­ror­ism.</p>
    <p>In the past two months, it has ar­rested 23 al­leged ter­ror­ists in dif­fer­ent places across Su­ma­tra is­land, in­clud­ing two men be­hind the Bali bomb­ings – Tau­fik Bu­laga, alias Upik Lawanga, and Aris Su­mar­sono, alias Zulka­r­naen.</p>
    <p>And last July, a Jakarta court sen­tenced Para Wi­jayanto, the key leader of Al-Qaeda-linked JI – whom ter­ror­ism ex­perts believe is Bashir’s stu­dent – to seven years in jail for his role in re­cruit­ing and train­ing mil­i­tants and rais­ing funds for those go­ing to Syria.</p>
