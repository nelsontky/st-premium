    <p>Sing­tel is giv­ing its share­hold­ers the op­tion to opt for shares in lieu of cash for its div­i­dend pay­ment due on Jan 15.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it man­dates that the choice has to be sub­mit­ted on­line. It states cat­e­gor­i­cally that all other modes of sub­mis­sion will not be pro­cessed.</p>
    <p>It ap­pears that the push for dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion has reached a point where no choice is given for other modes of sub­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Not ev­ery­one has a smart­phone or com­puter to go the on­line way.</p>
    <p>If Sing­tel feels that send­ing a pa­per form to ev­ery share­holder may be a waste of pa­per, as some share­hold­ers may pre­fer the on­line op­tion, then it could pro­vide a tele­phone num­ber that share­hold­ers who pre­fer the pa­per op­tion form can call, to in­di­cate their re­quests for a pa­per form to be sent to them.</p>
    <p>This is what the In­land Rev­enue Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore pro­vides for tax­pay­ers who pre­fer to do pa­per fil­ing.</p>
    <p>I re­cently called the Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund Board to send me a pa­per form to do my vol­un­tary top-up. I was told that I would have to wait be­tween three weeks and a month for the form to be sent to me.</p>
    <p>I have reser­va­tions about the se­cu­rity of a dig­i­tal to­ken for SingPass trans­ac­tions via a mo­bile app. In­ter­net trans­ac­tions also carry risks, as shown by the nu­mer­ous re­ports of peo­ple los­ing mil­lions through scams and In­ter­net-re­lated crimes.</p>
    <p>So the pa­per op­tion should still be pro­vided for those who do not have great con­fi­dence in the dig­i­tal way, or who do not have the equip­ment to do so.</p>
    <p>Be­sides, what re­dun­dancy has been set up in the event of Web out­ages due to the acts of rogue gov­ern­ments or other crim­i­nals?</p>
    <p>In­ter­net trans­ac­tions also carry risks, as shown by the nu­mer­ous re­ports of peo­ple los­ing mil­lions through scams.</p>
