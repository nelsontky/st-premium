    <p>It is a mile­stone for us be­cause you reach a dif­fer­ent in­dus­try. While we have al­ways been in the per­form­ing arts, this is a prod­uct that peo­ple can use. It’s even more rel­e­vant in this cur­rent time when we keep talk­ing about in­no­va­tion and dig­i­tal ad­vance­ment.</p>
    <p>If you hear what sounds like a hun­dred drums on the sound­track to Dis­ney’s Mu­lan, you are prob­a­bly lis­ten­ing to sounds sam­pled from one Sin­ga­porean per­cus­sion­ist’s play­ing.</p>
    <p>Home-grown Ding Yi Mu­sic Com­pany’s Low Yik Hang was one of 16 mu­si­cians from the en­sem­ble who spent 10 long days in Pat­taya, Thai­land, in 2018, record­ing mu­sic which would end up on the movie’s sound­track.</p>
    <p>That record­ing ses­sion gave rise to Phoenix Orches­tra, a ground­break­ing soft­ware tool and the only one to date to of­fer com­posers a comprehens­ive Chi­nese clas­si­cal in­stru­ment sound li­brary.</p>
    <p>This li­brary was utilised by Mu­lan’s com­poser Harry Greg­sonWil­liams in putting to­gether the sound­track.</p>
    <p>Ding Yi’s gen­eral man­ager Elvia Goh, 31, says the pro­ject be­gan with an un­ex­pected call on the com­pany’s of­fice phone: “We don’t even re­ceive calls that much on the land­line any­more in the of­fice.”</p>
    <p>On the other end of the line was award-win­ning Bri­tish com­poser</p>
    <p>Richard Har­vey.</p>
    <p>Ms Goh re­calls: “He said he was a film com­poser, he had a pro­ject re­lated to Dis­ney and he was very in­ter­ested to work with Ding Yi. It’s like a dream come true.”</p>
    <p>Be­sides work­ing with Greg­sonWil­liams on the Mu­lan sound­track, Har­vey was also col­lab­o­rat­ing with Ber­lin-based soft­ware com­pany Orchestral Tools, which spe­cialises in cre­at­ing vir­tual in­stru­ments for pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>Har­vey was de­vel­op­ing a Chi­nese orches­tra li­brary and Ding Yi’s mu­si­cians pro­vided all the mu­sic sam­ples for the soft­ware, which was launched on Mon­day last week.</p>
    <p>The mu­si­cians worked 12-hour days, from 9am to 9pm, at mu­si­cian Chris Craker’s famed Karma Stu­dios, which has hosted mu­si­cians from Jolin Tsai to Shawn Men­des.</p>
    <p>The team, along­side pro­fes­sion­als from Orchestral Tools, recorded four orchestral sec­tions, seven in­stru­ment en­sem­bles and 21 solo in­stru­ments, in­clud­ing the erhu, guzheng and ruan.</p>
    <p>Ms Goh says of the pro­ject: “It is a mile­stone for us be­cause you reach a dif­fer­ent in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“While we have al­ways been in the per­form­ing arts, this is a prod­uct that peo­ple can use. It’s even more rel­e­vant in this cur­rent time when we keep talk­ing about in­no­va­tion and dig­i­tal ad­vance­ment.”</p>
    <p>The pan­demic de­layed the re­lease of Mu­lan the movie, but the mu­si­cians were ex­cited to watch it and sat through the end cred­its in order to see their names.</p>
    <p>Ms Goh says with a chuckle: “So many peo­ple posted videos and pho­tos of the rolling cred­its. It’s not just our mu­si­cians.</p>
    <p>“Friends of our mu­si­cians, in a way, felt proud for us be­cause it’s see­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans on the rolling cred­its of a Dis­ney movie.”</p>
