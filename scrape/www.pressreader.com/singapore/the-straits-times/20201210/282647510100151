    </section>

    <p>De­spite its ti­tle, this is not a movie about Sin­ga­pore as it is. It is a movie about a Sin­ga­pore of the imag­i­na­tion, a place with bits of its iden­tity blown up to al­most car­toon­ish pro­por­tions.</p>
    <p>Those bits, such as the Gov­ern­ment’s fond­ness for so­cial con­trol, are highly lam­poon­able. Any ar­ti­cle about Sin­ga­pore in, say, The New York Times or The New Yorker, tends to abound in smug com­men­tary about how things like univer­sal mask-wear­ing or clean, af­ford­able pub­lic trans­port sys­tems can op­er­ate here only be­cause of its cit­i­zens’ ab­nor­mal propen­sity for toe­ing the line.</p>
    <p>In an in­di­rect fash­ion, the film also mocks mass gulli­bil­ity, a trait that makes one seek sooth­ing pre­des­ti­na­tion over messy free will.</p>
    <p>Thomas Pang is Ah Bee, a typ­i­cal Sin­ga­porean worker bee (pun prob­a­bly in­tended) who, fed up with his met­rics-driven job, opts to join the club of the film’s ti­tle, a com­mu­nity with utopian ideals that sound sus­pi­ciously like typ­i­cal Sin­ga­porean goals.</p>
    <p>In ex­change for fol­low­ing rules re­li­giously – and this in­cludes dat­ing a per­son se­lected for him – Ah Bee will be set for life.</p>
    <p>A panop­ti­con-equipped ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence con­tin­u­ously mea­sures his emo­tional sta­tus and of­fers op­tions it thinks he needs to max­imise hap­pi­ness.</p>
    <p>The plot is a play­ful take on the idea of the World Hap­pi­ness Re­port, a rank­ing of na­tions based on how happy its cit­i­zens say they are. Fin­land – which hap­pens to be where the film’s co-screen­writer, Antti Toivo­nen, comes from – came in at No. 1 this year, with Sin­ga­pore in a dis­mal 31st po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>As Toivo­nen has said, the re­port baf­fles his com­pa­tri­ots, who ev­ery year get into a de­bate over whether they de­serve the ti­tle of the world’s hap­pi­est peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, in the film, ques­tions spring into Ah Bee’s mind as he ma­tures and comes to un­der­stand him­self bet­ter. Mind you, this is not a science-fic­tion thriller – there is no con­spir­acy at the heart of the club, nor is there a vil­lain­ous mas­ter­mind, whether sil­i­con­based or hu­man, to be de­feated.</p>
    <p>Rather, the story tries to state, through the gen­tle un­fold­ing of events spiced with a hint of comic ex­ag­ger­a­tion, just how un­ruly and met­rics-stump­ing the hu­man heart can be. This is not earth­shak­ing news, but the sen­ti­ment is pal­pa­bly sin­cere.</p>
    <p>Di­rec­tor and co-writer Tan Bee Thiam makes full use of the pro­duc­tion’s am­bi­tiously the­atri­cal de­sign, so the film of­fers the best interior shots for a Sin­ga­pore work in years – the colour-matched vi­su­als are sump­tu­ous and the stag­ing of the en­sem­ble cast in group scenes is deeply sat­is­fy­ing to watch.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese theatre vet­eran Ja­lyn Han as the oddly cruel Ms Wee, an el­derly per­son Ah Bee cares for as part of his du­ties, of­fers a vi­brant break­out per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>What the film lacks is drive. It is of­ten funny and tren­chant in how it sees the banal at­trac­tive­ness of con­form­ity, but the story gets bogged down when it finds it­self not know­ing what to do with Ah Bee other than have him act as a mute observer to mildly wacky go­ings-on.</p>
    <p>MANK</p>
    <p>NC16, 132 min­utes, show­ing on Net­flix</p>
    <p>There is more than a whiff of Os­car bait about this project, a por­trait of a Hol­ly­wood word­smith who quips like Os­car Wilde, drinks like a fish and lurches from one disas­ter to an­other. It is a role that calls for an ac­tor to show Range with a cap­i­tal R.</p>
    <p>There is an added dan­ger. Movies about writ­ers, es­pe­cially screen­writ­ers, should carry a warn­ing about ex­ces­sive amounts of self-con­grat­u­la­tion and hero wor­ship.</p>
    <p>Those caveats, how­ever, can be safely put aside for this un­flag­gingly en­ter­tain­ing biopic of screen­writer Her­man J. Mankiewicz, cel­e­brated as the ge­nius who penned the tow­er­ing work of Amer­i­can cin­ema,</p>
    <p>Cit­i­zen Kane (1941), a movie based loosely on the life of me­dia mogul Wil­liam Ran­dolph Hearst.</p>
    <p>Mankiewicz, called Mank by friends, was hot prop­erty in the 1930s, a well-liked wit known for mak­ing dia­logue sing and char­ac­ters spring to life.</p>
    <p>Di­rec­tor David Fincher, on the other hand, is known for edgy projects such as crime thrillers The Girl With The Dragon Tat­too (2011) and Seven (1995). The other biopic on his re­sume is the Os­car-nom­i­nated The So­cial</p>
    <p>Net­work (2010), which skew­ered Face­book founder Mark Zucker­berg by show­ing him to be a charm­less nerd out for vengeance, a mon­ster poles apart from the gen­er­ous ex­tro­vert Mank.</p>
    <p>The Zucker­berg film is writ­ten by the an­gry hu­man­ist Aaron Sorkin; Mank is writ­ten by Fincher’s fa­ther, Jack Fincher, who died of cancer in 2003 be­fore he could gain trac­tion as a screen­writer. Mank was sup­posed to have been a 1990s fa­ther-son project, but de­lays caused it to be com­pleted only re­cently.</p>
    <p>Ig­nor­ing how this seems to be an in me­mo­riam project or aimed at clinch­ing Academy Awards, this is a fun watch, though some­what tir­ing be­cause of its length. But since it is on Net­flix, watch it with pauses aplenty to give the mind a break from the del­uge of repar­tee.</p>
    <p>Fincher, for a film-maker who has not de­liv­ered any­thing as light as this, is right on the money in the cam­era work, edit­ing and crisply edited dia­logue.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish ac­tress Amanda</p>
    <p>Seyfried shines as the smart, frag­ile Mar­ion Davies, an ac­tress whose re­la­tion­ship with Hearst was, as many be­lieved, scan­dalously out­lined in Cit­i­zen Kane.</p>
    <p>Gary Old­man, also Bri­tish, plays Mank as the charm­ing but wildly un­pre­dictable drinker who could be the life of a cock­tail party or clear the room by drop­ping a bomb­shell about the host. Out­side of the iconic come­dies With­nail And I (1987) and Arthur (1981), it is hard to find a more bravura dis­play of drunk act­ing.</p>
    <p>JOSEE</p>
    <p>PG, 117 min­utes, opens to­day Not re­viewed</p>
    <p>In this South Korean ro­mance, Young-seok (Nam Joo-hyuk) is a univer­sity stu­dent who meets the wheel­chair-us­ing Josee (Han Ji-min) by ac­ci­dent. De­spite be­ing mostly shut in, Josee is sur­pris­ingly worldly, a trait that en­trances Young-seok.</p>
