    <p>It will take at least two years for the global avi­a­tion in­dus­try to re­cover from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and for mass travel to re­turn, Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said, stress­ing the im­por­tance of de­vel­op­ing a widely avail­able and ef­fec­tive vac­cine to help coun­tries open their bor­ders.</p>
    <p>“When a vac­cine is widely avail­able around the world and peo­ple gain con­fi­dence to travel again and visit other coun­tries, then we will have avi­a­tion back on its feet, al­most fully,” Mr Ong said in an in­ter­view with Bloomberg Tele­vi­sion pub­lished yes­ter­day. “How long that will take, I can’t make a guess, I would say min­i­mally a cou­ple of years.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has to “find ways to try to re­vive” the avi­a­tion sec­tor, the min­is­ter said, adding that Sin­ga­pore’s test­ing ca­pac­ity is now around 30,000 a day and may rise to 40,000 by next month and prob­a­bly fur­ther after then. A bal­ance needs to be struck be­tween travel and epi­demic con­trol, Mr Ong said.</p>
    <p>Asked about Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA), which posted a record quar­terly loss in the three months to June and is re­duc­ing its work­force by about 20 per cent, Mr Ong said the car­rier faces a “dire sit­u­a­tion” be­cause of the pan­demic and the fact that it has no do­mes­tic market to fall back on.</p>
    <p>Virus-re­lated travel re­stric­tions mean SIA, which raised $11 bil­lion largely through a rights is­sue ear­lier in the cri­sis, is fly­ing a tiny frac­tion of its usual ca­pac­ity. Traf­fic fig­ures for Au­gust show the car­rier’s pas­sen­ger numbers were down 98.4 per cent from a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Whether SIA needs to raise more funds will largely de­pend on how suc­cess­ful any re­vival in travel is, Mr Ong said. “The more we can re­vive, the more cash they can gen­er­ate, the less their need for re­cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion.”</p>
    <p>A reg­u­la­tory fil­ing in Au­gust showed that the air­line had used half of the $8.8 bil­lion it raised through share sales, high­light­ing that car­ri­ers keep in­cur­ring ex­penses even when planes are left idle. The com­pany is re­view­ing its fleet and op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>To open bor­ders and en­cour­age peo­ple to travel again, quar­an­tine must be re­placed by ef­fec­tive Covid-19 test­ing, Mr Ong said. “We have to grad­u­ally open up the bor­ders, es­tab­lish the key links that made us a hub.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said Sin­ga­pore will need to re­view plans for a fifth ter­mi­nal at Changi Air­port. Con­struc­tion of the ter­mi­nal, orig­i­nally planned to be com­pleted in 2030, has been sus­pended for at least two years. “The as­sump­tions when we went into Ter­mi­nal 5 have to­tally changed,” he said. “I don’t have a pre­dic­tion or a crys­tal ball to say what will hap­pen to Ter­mi­nal 5 and what will hap­pen to global avi­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>In a fur­ther bid to re­vive travel, Sin­ga­pore will al­low cruises to nowhere later this year. Gent­ing Cruise Lines’ World Dream and Royal Caribbean In­ter­na­tional’s Quan­tum of the Seas will be­gin round-trip jour­neys from next month and De­cem­ber, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>“The big­gest de­fence is that the cruises are all res­i­dents of Sin­ga­pore and we have very low in­ci­dence rates,” Mr Ong said. “It is no dif­fer­ent from any coun­try now where pubs are open, peo­ple are so­cial­is­ing.”</p>
