    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • A rare trad­ing card of Na­tional Basketball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) great LeBron James’ 2003-04 rookie cam­paign with the Cleve­land Cava­liers fetched US$1.84 mil­lion (S$2.56 mil­lion) at auc­tion over the week­end, the league has said.</p>
    <p>Bid­ding for the Up­per Deck card be­gan at US$150,000 be­fore it be­came not only the most ex­pen­sive basketball card ever pur­chased, but also the most ex­pen­sive trad­ing card in the mod­ern era – those pro­duced in 1980 or later.</p>
    <p>“Only 23 ver­sions of the Patch Au­to­graph Par­al­lel col­lec­tion for James were ever pro­duced. The rare card re­ceived a 9.5 mint gem grad­ing from Beck­ett grad­ing ser­vice,” the NBA said.</p>
    <p>“Num­bered 14 of 23, the card at­tracted 34 bids over the course of the 26-day auc­tion.”</p>
    <p>Darren Rovell of sports me­dia com­pany Ac­tion Net­work said the win­ning bid­der was Le­ore Avi­dar, the chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer and co­founder of Lob.com, a San Fran­cisco-based tech­nol­ogy com­pany.</p>
    <p>Ken Goldin, founder of Goldin Auc­tions, told ESPN that he was not sur­prised by the fi­nal price of the card, which was au­to­graphed by the 35-year-old Los An­ge­les Lak­ers for­ward, and was “happy with the re­sults”.</p>
    <p>He said: “When you’re talk­ing about a card that was lit­er­ally pro­duced 17 years ago and is for a guy still play­ing in the NBA, it’s just shock­ing news to a lot of peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>The record sale sur­passed a pre­vi­ous mark set in May when Goldin sold a Bow­man Draft Chrome Red Re­frac­tor Mike Trout signed rookie base­ball card, one of only five pro­duced, for US$922,500 and he feels that the value of sought-af­ter basketball cards in mint con­di­tion will con­tinue to sky­rocket.</p>
    <p>“I have a tremen­dous amount of over­seas bid­ders from China; we’ve had bid­ders from the Mid­dle East, bid­ders from Aus­tralia and from Europe,” he told ESPN.</p>
    <p>“With basketball, it could be as much as 50 to 60 per cent over­seas bid­ding be­cause it’s more of a world­wide sport.</p>
    <p>“It’s grow­ing, and I be­lieve po­ten­tially could have more growth than base­ball in the col­lectabil­ity as­pect of it.”</p>
