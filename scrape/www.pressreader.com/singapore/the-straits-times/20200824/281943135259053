    <p>As some parts of Amer­ica gin­gerly begin to open up af­ter months of near-to­tal lock­down, peo­ple have ques­tions. Will it be safe to take a train? A plane? Visit the hair salon? An in­door restau­rant?</p>
    <p>There are many know­able pa­ram­e­ters in the equa­tion: your health, the preva­lence of cases where you live, the safety pre­cau­tions be­ing taken at any place you want to visit. But the fi­nal an­swer may de­pend on your in­di­vid­ual risk tol­er­ance for ex­po­sure to in­fec­tious dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Most Amer­i­cans alive to­day have never be­fore had to make that self-as­sess­ment. In the past, deadly out­breaks of plague, flu and po­lio were reg­u­lar oc­cur­rences. Up un­til the mid-to-late 20th cen­tury, there were mumps, measles and chick­en­pox to con­tend with.</p>
    <p>In a world of ef­fec­tive an­tibi­otics and an­tivi­rals and other treat­ments, deaths or even se­ri­ous ill­nesses from in­fec­tious dis­ease seem nearly in­com­pre­hen­si­ble. So our fear is enor­mous, and our risk tol­er­ance for ex­po­sure is just about zero.</p>
    <p>I hear too many peo­ple say­ing “I’m not go­ing back to life un­til there’s a vac­cine” – as if that will im­me­di­ately elim­i­nate the risk. It won’t. Even if one of the cur­rent vac­cine can­di­dates works, it could be quite awhile be­fore it’s widely dis­trib­uted. And to be ap­proved by the Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion, it has to pro­tect only half of the peo­ple who take it from in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>For the fore­see­able fu­ture, we will be liv­ing in a world with some level of coro­n­avirus out there. So if we want to get out of our bunkers, we all need to take stock of our risk tol­er­ance.</p>
    <p>As a doc­tor, I worked in a New York City emer­gency room and in a re­mote clinic in Kenya, and then as a jour­nal­ist cov­er­ing dis­ease. I’ve had to mea­sure my risk tol­er­ance in dif­fer­ent sit­u­a­tions. Once, col­lect­ing blood from an Aids pa­tient, I couldn’t feel the artery through my glove. The glove came off.</p>
    <p>Treat­ing a pa­tient with mul­tidrug-re­sis­tant tu­ber­cu­lo­sis, I pulled my sur­gi­cal mask a lit­tle tighter, made sure the win­dows were open and – ir­ra­tionally – tried to breathe in less.</p>
    <p>Re­port­ing from the an­i­mal mar­ket where the Sars (se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome) out­break is thought to have started, I told my­self that I should be okay, since it was out­doors. But I stayed away from an­i­mals be­ing slaugh­tered, didn’t touch any sur­faces and took my shoes off be­fore en­ter­ing my ho­tel room.</p>
    <p>Note that these de­ci­sions do not mean ig­nor­ing the data and in­fec­tious dis­ease spe­cial­ists’ rec­om­men­da­tions, as some on the right are do­ing as they push ahead to re­open schools, busi­nesses, restau­rants and sports events.</p>
    <p>Ac­tu­ally it’s kind of the op­po­site: Ac­cept­ing risk doesn’t mean throw­ing cau­tion to the wind. It means tak­ing all pre­cau­tions and de­cid­ing you can live with the very re­duced risk that re­mains.</p>
    <p>With the coro­n­avirus, the only way to elim­i­nate all risk is es­sen­tially to move to a house in the coun­try­side and live in your fam­ily bub­ble. And many Amer­i­cans, par­tic­u­larly wealthy ones, have done just that. This per­sonal re­sponse was ex­treme, but it felt ra­tio­nal to many peo­ple be­cause our na­tional re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus was so scat­ter­shot, flat-footed and in­com­pe­tent.</p>
    <p>But iso­la­tion is wear­ing thin. So, as states and cities en­gi­neer sen­si­ble re­open­ing poli­cies, ev­ery­one is go­ing to have to as­sess their risk tol­er­ance and cau­tiously push their per­sonal bound­aries bit by bit.</p>
    <p>Some, of course, never got to make this de­ci­sion. Risk tol­er­ance is about duty and con­science, but very of­ten, it’s also about how much you need a pay cheque.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors, nurses and oth­ers who work in health­care had no choice but to dive in. These folks did not, as so many have claimed, go into the pro­fes­sion “know­ing the risks”. They came to work know­ing that the risk of in­fec­tious diseases could be con­trolled with care­ful pre­cau­tions.</p>
    <p>That’s why they felt an­gry and be­trayed when they were asked to fight the coro­n­avirus with­out an ad­e­quate sup­ply of pro­tec­tive gear or train­ing on the new pathogen. And trag­i­cally, some died as a re­sult.</p>
    <p>Now, many physi­cians I know in Covid-19 hot spots say they ac­tu­ally feel safest in the hos­pi­tal, where pro­ce­dures such as mask­ing and sani­tis­ing are as­sid­u­ously fol­lowed. (Hell hath no fury like a sur­geon who wit­nesses a med­i­cal stu­dent touch a ster­ile sur­face with an un­ster­ile hand.) In con­trast, on the side­walk, the coro­n­avirus could be roam­ing free if peo­ple aren’t wear­ing masks.</p>
    <p>This is why mask­ing should be man­dated and en­forced. It’s not just about your in­di­vid­ual risk tol­er­ance, but about keep­ing ev­ery­one safe.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to wear­ing masks and so­cial dis­tanc­ing when not at home, we should avoid pro­longed pe­ri­ods in in­door spa­ces with crowds or strangers, wash or sani­tise our hands – a lot – and try not to touch “high-touch” sur­faces that hun­dreds of peo­ple have grabbed be­fore. (Note to my lo­cal post of­fice: You should have some kind of au­to­matic door rather than re­quire ev­ery­one to pull the han­dle!)</p>
    <p>And we have to de­mand that any­where we go – book­stores, med­i­cal of­fices, trains or hair sa­lons – re­quires that pa­trons fol­low these guide­lines. I, for one, won’t en­ter if they don’t.</p>
    <p>I do not blame teach­ers for be­ing un­will­ing to re­turn to school in places where ad­min­is­tra­tors and lo­cal of­fi­cials have been in de­nial about Covid-19, or have been un­will­ing or un­able to do this prepara­tory work. But once schools have put in place ap­pro­pri­ate science-based steps, most teach­ers (those not in high-risk groups) should re­turn to their jobs.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 is a very se­ri­ous dis­ease. But it is not the Black Death, which killed up to half of Europe in the 14th cen­tury. A vac­cine, when and if it ar­rives, will be a big help. But in the mean­time, we have science. We know what causes Covid-19. We are learn­ing more about how to de­tect, pre­vent and treat it every day.</p>
    <p>So, in­stead of tak­ing your tem­per­a­ture and check­ing your pulse oxime­ter read­ing twice a day, it may be time to take stock of your risk tol­er­ance. In those places where gov­ern­ments, busi­nesses and ad­min­is­tra­tors have set the stage prop­erly, we can – with sen­si­ble pre­cau­tions – begin to live again. • Elis­a­beth Rosen­thal worked as an emer­gency room physi­cian be­fore be­com­ing a jour­nal­ist.
