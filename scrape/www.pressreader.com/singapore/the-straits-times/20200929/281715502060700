    <p>Ex­plana­tory jour­nal­ism and ac­cess to re­li­able in­for­ma­tion will have key roles in deal­ing with the pan­demic, Asian jour­nal­ists said at a we­bi­nar to mark World News Day yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mis­in­for­ma­tion is caus­ing much alarm and mak­ing it dif­fi­cult for coun­tries to tackle the spread of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, they noted.</p>
    <p>The jour­nal­ists were par­tic­i­pat­ing in a we­bi­nar, ti­tled Covid-19: How Can You Con­trib­ute?, tele­cast over Zoom and YouTube. More than 500 peo­ple had signed up for the we­bi­nar.</p>
    <p>Fa­cil­i­tated by The Straits Times’ Asian Insider edi­tor She­fali Rekhi, the panel took up the is­sue of the plague of mis­in­for­ma­tion in In­done­sia, the Philip­pines and Sin­ga­pore, and weighed in on ef­forts of jour­nal­ists to counter the in­fo­demic.</p>
    <p>With lack of ac­cu­rate data from the In­done­sian gov­ern­ment, many In­done­sians are turn­ing to move­ments that have ap­peared in the grass­roots and so-called “ex­perts” to plug the in­for­ma­tion gap, said Mr Tama Salim, world news edi­tor at The Jakarta Post.</p>
    <p>“Mis­in­for­ma­tion creeps into the va­cant spa­ces that are lack­ing at­ten­tion by the gov­ern­ment... This kind of in­for­ma­tion has re­sulted in even in­flu­encers and their tens of thou­sands of fol­low­ers fall­ing vic­tim,” he said.</p>
    <p>Fel­low pan­el­list Zakir Hus­sain, ST’s Sin­ga­pore edi­tor and vicepres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore Press Club, dis­cussed the alarm in Sin­ga­pore af­ter false­hoods spread on so­cial me­dia chan­nels.</p>
    <p>“I think one area where fake news and mis­in­for­ma­tion spread quite rapidly was among mi­grant worker com­mu­ni­ties them­selves be­cause they didn’t un­der­stand, or didn’t have ac­cess to in­for­ma­tion in their own lan­guages ini­tially,” he said.</p>
    <p>In the Philip­pines, Ms Pam Rances, dig­i­tal con­tent man­ager at the Manila Bul­letin, said sev­eral Filipino news­rooms had pub­lished ex­plain­ers to give read­ers a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of the virus.</p>
    <p>But Mr Salim said jour­nal­ists can­not know ev­ery­thing there is to know about Covid-19 in In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to a ques­tion from the au­di­ence on how to coax read­ers to lis­ten to in­for­ma­tion that is in­con­ve­nient to them, both Ms Rances and Mr Hus­sain agreed that news on Covid-19 must reach the au­di­ence on plat­forms fa­mil­iar to them such as What­sApp.</p>
    <p>Wrap­ping up the ses­sion, Ms Rekhi said tap­ping cred­i­ble me­dia sources is one way to fight the in­fo­demic. She said that le­gacy and tra­di­tional me­dia are sources of cred­i­ble in­for­ma­tion, while Mr Salim added that stu­dents should ap­proach a mix of news out­lets to fact-check any in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>World News Day was cre­ated in 2018 and spot­lights the rel­e­vance of good jour­nal­ism.</p>
