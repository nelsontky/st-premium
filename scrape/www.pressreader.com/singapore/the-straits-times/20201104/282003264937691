    <p>The Malaysian gov­ern­ment is look­ing at ways to de­fer or sus­pend elec­tions be­cause of the surge in Covid-19 cases, two min­is­ters told Par­lia­ment this week.</p>
    <p>Bound by the Con­sti­tu­tion, the gov­ern­ment is cur­rently un­able to stop a Sabah by-election on Dec 5 as well as a state election in Sarawak, due after June next year.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s De­part­ment (Spe­cial Func­tions) Mohd Redzuan Md Yusof told Par­lia­ment on Mon­day that large gath­er­ings dur­ing the Sabah state election in Septem­ber had caused the coun­try’s cur­rent Covid-19 surge.</p>
    <p>“Election is un­der the ju­ris­dic­tion of the Election Com­mis­sion and I am un­able to pro­vide fur­ther in­for­ma­tion on whether a by-election or a gen­eral election can or can­not be held but the gov­ern­ment is al­ways mon­i­tor­ing.</p>
    <p>“If need be, cre­ate a spe­cific Act; the gov­ern­ment is study­ing and mak­ing pro­pos­als to the peo­ple,” he said on Mon­day in re­ply to a ques­tion in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Another min­is­ter yes­ter­day how­ever told Par­lia­ment that leg­is­la­tion to sus­pend elec­tions would be con­trary to the fed­eral Con­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>“The cre­ation of a Bill to post­pone an election dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic is against and in­con­sis­tent with the fed­eral Con­sti­tu­tion, and to amend it would re­quire the sup­port of two-thirds of</p>
    <p>MPs,” said Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s De­part­ment Takiyud­din Has­san.</p>
    <p>Datuk Takiyud­din said the gov­ern­ment could in­stead in­voke an emer­gency. “The gov­ern­ment may pro­pose to post­pone an election if this pan­demic is deemed to be de­clared an emer­gency as pro­vided un­der Ar­ti­cle 150 (1) of the fed­eral Con­sti­tu­tion,” he said yes­ter­day, with­out elab­o­rat­ing, in a writ­ten re­ply to Barisan Na­sional MP Mahdzir Khalid.</p>
    <p>On Oct 25, the King re­jected a con­tro­ver­sial re­quest from Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin for emer­gency pow­ers.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Mahdzir on Mon­day had asked the Prime Min­is­ter if the gov­ern­ment had any plans to amend the Con­sti­tu­tion, or cre­ate a spe­cific Bill to en­able an election to be post­poned amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Sabah is set to hold a by-election in Batu Sapi on Dec 5, fol­low­ing the death of state op­po­si­tion MP Liew Vui Keong.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Sabah recorded 678 new Covid-19 cases, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber of in­fec­tions in the state to 16,873. The cu­mu­la­tive death toll for the state is 131.</p>
    <p>Na­tion­wide, a record 1,054 pos­i­tive cases were re­ported, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber to 34,393. The death toll so far is 263.</p>
    <p>The de­te­ri­o­rat­ing Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion has prompted Malaysia’s Health Min­istry to call for amend­ments to the Pre­ven­tion and Con­trol of In­fec­tious Dis­eases Act to al­low for elec­tions to be de­ferred for safety rea­sons.</p>
    <p>Health di­rec­tor-gen­eral Noor Hisham Abdullah was quoted as say­ing on Oct 30 by lo­cal news site Free Malaysia To­day: “Back in 1988, we were only look­ing at in­fec­tious dis­eases within a lo­cal­ity but now we have to look at it on a na­tion­wide and even global scale.</p>
    <p>“We need to amend and strengthen the Act for fu­ture use. We have sent a pro­posal for amend­ments to the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers and we hope they will be re­viewed as soon as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>He added that it is not suit­able for elec­tions to be car­ried out as the cur­rent in­fec­tion rate still had not met the min­istry’s tar­get of less than 0.5.</p>
    <p>GOVT STUDY­ING PRO­POS­ALS</p>
    <p>Election is un­der the ju­ris­dic­tion of the Election Com­mis­sion and I am un­able to pro­vide fur­ther in­for­ma­tion on whether a by-election or a gen­eral election can or can­not be held but the gov­ern­ment is al­ways mon­i­tor­ing... If need be, cre­ate a spe­cific Act; the gov­ern­ment is study­ing and mak­ing pro­pos­als to the peo­ple.</p>
    <p>DATUK SERI MOHD REDZUAN MD YUSOF, Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s De­part­ment (Spe­cial Func­tions) .</p>
