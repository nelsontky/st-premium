    <p>The or­gan­is­ers of the Na­tional Day Pa­rade (NDP) this year have apol­o­gised for er­rors in the Tamil text that was broad­cast live on tele­vi­sion. Dur­ing the evening show, a line of song lyrics with a Tamil phrase that was sup­posed to read “My Sin­ga­pore” had strokes and let­ters in the wrong places, which made the words un­in­tel­li­gi­ble.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­is­ers of the Na­tional Day Pa­rade (NDP) this year have apol­o­gised for er­rors in the Tamil text that was broad­cast live on tele­vi­sion in the evening show on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to a line of an­i­mated Tamil song lyrics dis­played on the LED screens as part of a per­for­mance, the NDP2020 ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee’s (exco) chair­man, Bri­gadier-Gen­eral Fred­er­ick Choo, said: “Un­for­tu­nately, the an­i­ma­tion ef­fects re­sulted in one line of the Tamil song lyrics hav­ing mis­aligned char­ac­ters.”</p>
    <p>He added: “The NDP2020 exco apol­o­gises for the er­ror. The exco had en­gaged Tamil trans­la­tors to en­sure the ac­cu­racy of the Tamil song lyrics and the Tamil trans­la­tions of the films and per­for­mances in other lan­guages.</p>
    <p>“All lyrics for pro­jec­tion were ac­cu­rate prior to dig­i­tal an­i­ma­tion. We will fur­ther strengthen the pro­duc­tion process and be mind­ful for fu­ture NDPs.”</p>
    <p>The ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee worked with broad­caster Me­di­a­corp to cor­rect the an­i­mated text for the on­line footage streamed on YouTube and meWatch, he said.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the evening show, a line of song lyrics with a Tamil phrase that was sup­posed to read “My Sin­ga­pore” had strokes and let­ters in the wrong places, which made the words un­in­tel­li­gi­ble.</p>
    <p>The Tamil words for “friends” and “sib­lings” were also mis­spelt.</p>
    <p>Mr Karthikeya­n So­ma­sun­daram, a 36-year-old free­lance artist, wrote about the blun­ders on Face­book on Mon­day night, ask­ing of­fi­cials to take “ex­tra care” when it comes to Tamil.</p>
    <p>He wrote that while he un­der­stood that mis­takes can hap­pen, some­one should have checked and pointed them out.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Straits Times, he said he was “very dis­ap­pointed” by the mis­takes, espe­cially since this is not the first time that Tamil lan­guage er­rors have popped up in of­fi­cial doc­u­ments or ma­te­ri­als.</p>
    <p>He said: “This has hap­pened one too many times. What irks me the most is that while the of­fi­cials show the ef­fort to reach out to the Tamil com­mu­nity, by writ­ing or speak­ing in Tamil, they fail to en­sure the ac­cu­racy of the lan­guage.</p>
    <p>“It’s just one ex­tra step, but by not check­ing the ac­cu­racy, they’re show­ing com­pla­cency.”</p>
    <p>E-com­merce busi­ness owner Vi­jaya Kan­dasamy, 45, also wrote about Sun­day’s gaffes on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post, she wrote: “It al­ways hap­pens in our na­tional events. I am sure mul­ti­ple re­hearsals were on be­fore the pro­gramme got aired on the chan­nels. Dis­ap­pointed that none of them no­ticed to rec­tify.”</p>
    <p>She told ST: “Maybe these mis­takes don’t mat­ter much to peo­ple who don’t speak Tamil, but they are very dis­ap­point­ing to the Tamil com­mu­nity be­cause we feel like our lan­guage has not been given the same level of re­spect.”</p>
    <p>In 2017, the or­gan­is­ers of the NDP apol­o­gised for Tamil lan­guage er­rors printed in pub­lic­ity brochures that were dis­trib­uted to Pri­mary 5 pupils ahead of the Na­tional Ed­u­ca­tion shows.</p>
    <p>The Tamil phrase that was sup­posed to read “let’s come to­gether as one na­tion” ended up be­ing gib­ber­ish when the let­ters were jum­bled.</p>
    <p>In a writ­ten re­ply to MP Mu­rali Pil­lai, De­fence Min­is­ter Ng Eng Hen told Par­lia­ment that the orig­i­nal Tamil trans­la­tion sub­mit­ted was cor­rect but er­rors were made by the print­ers.</p>
