    <p>Sum­mer’s end has brought on a new phase for the United States econ­omy. Cin­e­mas are open, col­lege and pro­fes­sional foot­ball games are be­ing played with fans in the stands, and New York City is set to par­tially re­open in­door din­ing. Per­haps it’s no sur­prise that com­pa­nies such as JPMor­gan Chase & Co are look­ing to call of­fice work­ers back as well, po­ten­tially mark­ing an un­of­fi­cial start to post-pan­demic of­fice culture.</p>
    <p>As fu­ture-of-work dis­cus­sions shift from the­o­ret­i­cal to prac­ti­cal, one much-ma­ligned com­pany that could be a so­lu­tion to a world of hy­brid work is WeWork.</p>
    <p>While it has made plenty of er­rors, its core mis­sion of pro­vid­ing com­mu­nity and flex­i­bil­ity to of­fice work­ers and com­pa­nies might be ex­actly what we need as we re-en­vi­sion the work­ing world based on the lessons learnt over the past six months.</p>
    <p>WeWork has ap­peal in a world where com­pa­nies and work­ers are look­ing for hy­brid or flex­i­ble mod­els. Early in the pan­demic, Face­book chief ex­ec­u­tive</p>
    <p>Mark Zucker­berg said that as many as half of his com­pany’s work­ers could be re­mote in five to 10 years.</p>
    <p>More re­cently, after six months of tech em­ploy­ees work­ing re­motely, Net­flix CEO Reed Hast­ings said re­mote work has been a “pure neg­a­tive” and wants work­ers back in the of­fice as soon as pos­si­ble after the roll-out of a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Mr Hast­ings spec­u­lated that many com­pa­nies could ask work­ers to spend four days a week in the of­fice and one day a week work­ing re­motely.</p>
    <p>Other com­pa­nies may pur­sue dif­fer­ent ap­proaches – some fully re­mote, some with cer­tain roles in the of­fice full-time and oth­ers that are more flex­i­ble.</p>
    <p>It may take years for com­pa­nies to fig­ure out what best prac­tices look like. This is where the ser­vices WeWork pro­vides could be so valu­able.</p>
    <p>For com­pa­nies un­will­ing to com­mit to multi-year leases with­out know­ing what the new nor­mal looks like, it of­fers a way to get tem­po­rary or flex­i­ble space with ameni­ties that still let work­ers col­lab­o­rate in per­son.</p>
    <p>WeWork of­fices could be retro­fit­ted to pro­vide “Zoom con­fer­ence rooms” for high-def­i­ni­tion video, so re­mote work­ers aren’t wor­ried about limited tech­nol­ogy set-ups or awk­ward back­grounds at their homes.</p>
    <p>For work­ers whose hous­ing sit­u­a­tions aren’t amenable to re­mote work, WeWork can pro­vide an of­fice en­vi­ron­ment even if they work for a com­pany with a re­mote work culture.</p>
    <p>Pan­demic-re­lated mi­gra­tion trends could ex­pand the ge­o­graph­i­cal reach of WeWork. In its early days, it was con­cen­trated in ur­ban cen­tres such as New York and San Fran­cisco. An ex­panded culture of re­mote or hy­brid work could mean growth op­por­tu­ni­ties in ex­urbs or moun­tain towns that have a crit­i­cal mass of work­ers need­ing a more for­mal or col­lab­o­ra­tive work en­vi­ron­ment than a spare bed­room or home of­fice.</p>
    <p>It’s un­for­tu­nate that WeWork’s fi­nan­cial sit­u­a­tion is pre­car­i­ous after years of mishaps, with its bonds ma­tur­ing in 2025 trad­ing for around 70 US cents on the dol­lar. Be­cause now would ar­guably be the best time to start a com­pany just like it.</p>
    <p>Even if most com­pa­nies bring most em­ploy­ees back into of­fices over the next year, the ag­gre­gate num­ber of worker hours in re­mote or co-work­ing en­vi­ron­ments is likely to be far higher over the next few years than it was last year. And with of­fice va­can­cies soar­ing and rents drop­ping, WeWork could likely ac­quire build­ings or of­fice space far cheaper now than it ever could have over the past sev­eral years.</p>
    <p>It’s pos­si­ble that, due to its fi­nan­cial con­straints and tar­nished rep­u­ta­tion, WeWork might not be the com­pany to pull off this vi­sion.</p>
    <p>Some­times com­pa­nies can iden­tify an in­no­va­tive new prod­uct or ser­vice but be too early, too reck­less, or break too many rules to cre­ate a busi­ness that stands the test of time.</p>
    <p>Nap­ster rev­o­lu­tionised how peo­ple down­loaded and lis­tened to mu­sic, but was even­tu­ally shut down. Mu­sic stream­ing ser­vices such as Spo­tify and Ap­ple Mu­sic suc­ceeded le­git­i­mately where Nap­ster fell short.</p>
    <p>Whether or not WeWork ends up be­ing the com­pany that owns the mar­ket for flex­i­ble of­fice space, the busi­ness op­por­tu­nity to get that ser­vice right has never been greater.</p>
