    <p>• It has been nearly a year since Liverpool kicked off the Premier League sea­son, an unusual coro­n­avirus-hit cam­paign which will fi­nally stag­ger to a con­clu­sion to­mor­row with un­re­solved is­sues at both ends of the ta­ble set to pro­vide fi­nal-day drama.</p>
    <p>Liverpool are cham­pi­ons and Nor­wich City, the side whom they beat on Aug 9 to l aunch their ti­tle charge, are down and Manchester City are dis­tant run­ners-up. Af­ter that ev­ery­thing is up for grabs.</p>
    <p>At the bot­tom, two of Bournemout­h, Wat­ford and As­ton Villa will be rel­e­gated.</p>
    <p>Bournemout­h, in 19th spot, must win at Ever­ton and hope Wat­ford (18th) lose at Arse­nal and Villa (17th) lose at West Ham.</p>
    <p>Villa, who moved above Wat­ford on goal dif­fer­ence by beat­ing Arse­nal 1-0 in mid­week, when Wat­ford were ham­mered 4-0 by City, will be guar­an­teed sur­vival if they win as long as Wat­ford do not beat Arse­nal by at least a two-goal larger mar­gin.</p>
    <p>Wat­ford could stay up with­out se­cur­ing a two-goal greater win­ning mar­gin than Villa, but this would in­volve them mak­ing up a six-goal deficit in the goals scored col­umn. Villa could even sur­vive with a loss or draw de­pend­ing on other re­sults.</p>
    <p>For Wat­ford, their gam­ble to sack Nigel Pear­son with two games left could prove costly. In­terim boss Hay­den Mullins, with prac­ti­cally no top-flight man­age­rial ex­pe­ri­ence, was tasked to get points against City and Arse­nal and he has it all to do against the Gun­ners to­mor­row af­ter the Hor­nets lost 4-0 to Pep</p>
    <p>Guardi­ola’s men. The 41-year-old yes­ter­day called on his team not to “think about dif­fer­ent per­mu­ta­tions” in the fight for their sur­vival.</p>
    <p>“Noth­ing changes now go­ing into the last game of the sea­son,” he said. “We still have to get a re­sult whether it’s a draw or a win. Noth­ing re­ally changes in that sense it’s just now out of our hands.</p>
    <p>“We can only pre­pare for what we can pre­pare for and that’s to get our­selves in the right frame of mind.</p>
    <p>“We can’t re­ally think about dif­fer­ent per­mu­ta­tions or try and set up for that, we need to get ready for what we need to do.”</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to axe Pear­son last week was a big sur­prise af­ter the 56-year-old hauled Wat­ford off the bot­tom of the ta­ble fol­low­ing his ar­rival in De­cem­ber. Af­ter tak­ing over with the club nine points adrift, he over­saw a resur­gence that in­cluded a 3-0 win over Liverpool and a vic­tory against Manchester United.</p>
    <p>But Bri­tish me­dia re­ports claimed Pear­son was dis­missed fol­low­ing a heated dis­cus­sion with Wat­ford owner Gino Pozzo af­ter last week’s 3-1 de­feat at West Ham.</p>
    <p>It re­mains to be seen if the de­ci­sion could come back to bite the club. As­ton Villa boss Dean Smith, mean­while, has said that his side “con­trol our own des­tiny”.</p>
    <p>“That’s what we wanted to have go­ing into the last game,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It was look­ing un­likely and that we’d have to rely on oth­ers, but re­sults went our way in the week and we’re above the dot­ted line now.</p>
    <p>“The most im­por­tant thing is to be above that dot­ted line on Sun­day and we know we have to win to guar­an­tee that. We’ll be go­ing all out.”</p>
    <p>Bournemout­h’s sur­vival, un­like Villa’s, is not in their hands but the play­ers must ap­proach to­mor­row’s game at Ever­ton as if it is the most im­por­tant match of their ca­reers, urged man­ager Ed­die Howe.</p>
    <p>A draw or a loss at Good­i­son Park will see the Cher­ries drop to the Cham­pi­onship re­gard­less of the other re­sults, end­ing their five-year stay in Eng­land’s top divi­sion.</p>
    <p>“The next game is the big­gest game of all our ca­reers,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Con­trol­ling our emo­tions is go­ing to be key. We need the play­ers to play the game they’ve al­ways done and do so to a very high stan­dard. There’s be­lief we can win... then we’re hop­ing for the bit of luck.”</p>
