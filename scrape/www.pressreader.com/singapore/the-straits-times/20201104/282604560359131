    <p>It will be a big chal­lenge, and I wouldn’t know much about my op­po­nents’ con­di­tion or any change in style of play, just as they don’t know much about mine.</p>
    <p>FENG TIANWEI, the world No. 9 pad­dler, on what she ex­pects from her first tour­na­ment in eight months.</p>
    <p>The three months of in­ac­tiv­ity ear­lier this year was both a boon and a bane for Feng Tianwei. The cir­cuit breaker – the long­est break of her ca­reer – gave her a chance to rest her weary body after years of non­stop com­pe­ti­tion but it was also time un­ful­filled.</p>
    <p>At her ath­letic core, Feng, Sin­ga­pore’s most be­medalled Olympian with one sil­ver and two bronze medals in ta­ble ten­nis, is built to com­pete, and it was not long be­fore she be­gan to feel bored and un­set­tled.</p>
    <p>“As the weeks be­came months, it be­came too long, and I be­came rest­less,” the 34-year-old, whose last event was March’s Qatar Open where she lost to Ja­pan’s Mima Ito, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Pri­mar­ily based in Ja­pan where she trains, Feng re­turned to Sin­ga­pore in March as a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure dur­ing the early stages of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Lit­tle did she imag­ine the even­tual lock­downs world­wide, can­cel­la­tion of ma­jor sports events and se­vere travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>This month, Feng fi­nally re­turns to com­pet­i­tive ac­tion as one of 16 qualifiers for the Nov 8-10 In­ter­na­tional Ta­ble Ten­nis Fed­er­a­tion (ITTF) Women’s World Cup in Wei­hai, China.</p>
    <p>It is a busy month for her as she will then head to Zhengzhou for the Nov 19-22 ITTF Fi­nals be­fore trav­el­ling to Ma­cau for a pro­mo­tional World Ta­ble Ten­nis show­case event from Nov 25-29.</p>
    <p>The world No. 9 said: “I’m feel­ing happy and ex­cited again, but for the op­po­site rea­son – I’m re­ally look­ing for­ward to test­ing my­self in com­pe­ti­tion again.</p>
    <p>“It will be a big chal­lenge, and I wouldn’t know much about my op­po­nents’ con­di­tion or any change in style of play, just as they don’t know much about mine, although the Chi­nese players would be bet­ter pre­pared be­cause they have the num­bers and they just had their na­tional cham­pi­onships.”</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 era has thrown un­fa­mil­iar ob­sta­cles in her path. She flew to China on Oct 22 and had to be quar­an­tined in her ho­tel room for 10 days, leaving her just a week to pre­pare for the World Cup, her first tour­na­ment in eight months.</p>
    <p>The four-time World Cup bronze medal­list (2008, 2013, 2016, 2019) is un­daunted and be­lieves she can achieve a podium fin­ish.</p>
    <p>She said: “This is a unique sit­u­a­tion I’m ex­pe­ri­enc­ing for the first time and I wouldn’t know how I would feel un­til I go through it.</p>
    <p>“I’m pre­pared for dif­fi­cul­ties, which I hope to learn from and adapt. I do not wish to learn from los­ing, I’m hop­ing to adapt quickly dur­ing the games and make the nec­es­sary ad­just­ments to win matches.”</p>
    <p>The great un­known after such a long hia­tus is her phys­i­cal con­di­tion, said her coach He Keyi.</p>
    <p>He added: “We have been mak­ing the best out of just train­ing and not com­pet­ing, and Tianwei has trained well.</p>
    <p>“Com­pet­ing shortly after the quar­an­tine will have some im­pact on a player’s form, so we will be fo­cus­ing more on fit­ness and see what her lev­els are, be­fore we tweak the train­ing pro­gramme to be more op­po­nent-spe­cific.”</p>
    <p>Feng’s time in Sin­ga­pore was also a re­turn to fa­mil­iar sur­round­ings. While she parted ways with the Sin­ga­pore Ta­ble Ten­nis As­so­ci­a­tion in 2016, she spent some time work­ing with her for­mer team­mates.</p>
    <p>“It felt good at first to be back, spar­ring and catch­ing up with Yu Mengyu and Lin Ye,” she said. “We all work hard to spar with each other but after some time, I felt I could do with more vari­a­tion as I’m work­ing to­wards win­ning another Olympic medal for Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>She in­tends to hire ded­i­cated spar­ring part­ners to travel and train with her when re­stric­tions ease but ac­knowl­edged the added fi­nan­cial costs. Prior to the Covid-19 out­break, her an­nual sport­ing ex­penses eas­ily ran into a six-fig­ure sum.</p>
    <p>“The fi­nances are tight, but I’m coping, thanks to sup­port from the Sports Ex­cel­lence Schol­ar­ship,” she said.</p>
    <p>“I hope more in­ter­na­tional com­pe­ti­tions will open up in coun­tries that have a good record of deal­ing with the virus, not just for us to try and earn more prize money, but also to keep up our match fit­ness ahead of next year’s Olympics.”</p>
