    <p>The United States and China are hurl­ing strong words at each other over a range of is­sues, but look closer and there is also cal­i­bra­tion in the in­sults thrown, says as­so­ciate ed­i­tor Ravi Vel­loor (be­low).</p>
    <p>There’s this mem­o­rable anec­dote in Mario Puzo’s crime clas­sic,The God­fa­ther, where the mafia don from New York sends his hench­man to rea­son with a Hol­ly­wood mogul who is stand­ing in the way of his god­son get­ting a film role per­fect for him in ev­ery way, ex­cept that he has alien­ated the stu­dio big shot who now hates his guts.</p>
    <p>Where words fail, more po­tent nudges are some­times needed – in this case, a horse’s head placed in the stu­dio chief’s bed­room while he is asleep, blood and reedy ten­dons in­cluded, did the trick. It per­suaded the man that the favour re­quested, and de­clined, is se­ri­ous busi­ness. And thus he yields, shout­ing in­vec­tives and threats at the ac­tor and his Ital­ian ori­gins, the con­sigliere who had reached out to him with the ini­tial con­tact on be­half of his boss, and the mafia.</p>
    <p>But not a word against the God­fa­ther, him­self. Ge­nius, writes Puzo, has its re­wards.</p>
    <p>There’s no spe­cial ge­nius, and even less re­ward, in the ac­ri­mo­nious ex­changes that are caus­ing a tail­spin in ties be­tween the world’s two big­gest mil­i­tary pow­ers and economies. If any­thing, it be­speaks dan­ger­ous brinkman­ship as a once-over­whelm­ingly dom­i­nant hege­mon con­fronts a res­o­lute chal­lenger now pick­ing a cue or two from its own play­book on how to throw weight around.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, the curses the movie mogul held back from ut­ter­ing came to mind as I checked around the re­gion about the go­ings-on at the Asean Min­is­te­rial Meet­ing and re­lated meet­ings with di­a­logue part­ners hosted ear­lier this month by Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>Per­haps the two war­ring sides were mildly cramped by the fact that the con­fer­ence did not take place in a sin­gle hall but over video link. Even so, while both the United States and China did ro­bustly put forth their po­si­tions, each seemed to be tak­ing care to keep the at­tacks from get­ting too im­mod­er­ate.</p>
    <p>In­deed, the rare fris­son, ac­cord­ing to Asian diplo­mats privy to the talks, came when China’s Vice-For­eign Min­is­ter Luo Zhao­hui, stand­ing in for For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi, dropped an acid com­ment about “drunken ele­phants in the room”.</p>
    <p>Faint light at the end of the dark tun­nel of US-China ties? Maybe not. But then again, maybe.</p>
    <p>Some cul­tures, par­tic­u­larly in Asia, teach their young that even in­sults have to be mea­sured; if you spit up at a per­son high above you, the mu­cus falls back on your­self. If you do that to some­one far be­low you, it is a waste of time to de­scend so low. In­sults have to be ex­changed be­tween equals. But most im­por­tant of all, never insult so com­pletely that the door to a rec­on­cil­i­a­tion is closed for­ever. Per­haps that’s what we are wit­ness­ing.</p>
    <p>A real es­tate and casino mogul be­fore he ran for his first elected of­fice, which hap­pened to be the US pres­i­dency, the New York-born and raised Mr Don­ald Trump, whose most trusted coun­sel is close fam­ily, has or­dered his ad­min­is­tra­tion to pile on his strate­gic ad­ver­sary the most in­tense pres­sure seen in a half-cen­tury. Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo has en­thu­si­as­ti­cally fallen in line, as have his key deputies, in­clud­ing Mr Max Pottinger. Other arms of US gov­ern­ment such as the Pen­tagon have fallen in line as well.</p>
    <p>In July, two air­craft car­rier groups led by the USS Nimitz and USS Ron­ald Rea­gan con­ducted war games in the South China Sea, joined by sub­sur­face ves­sels and nu­clear-armed bombers. Tech­nol­ogy links built up over decades are be­ing torn apart like the wan­ton act of a child and within the US, the Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion is putting Chi­nese na­tion­als and Amer­i­cans of Chi­nese eth­nic­ity un­der un­prece­dented scru­tiny.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s long arm has even snatched Ms Meng Wanzhou, the pow­er­ful daugh­ter of the Huawei founder, one of China’s most re­spected tech ty­coons.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese diplo­mats and me­dia have pushed back, and un­feel­ingly for a na­tion where the virus was first iden­ti­fied, some­times sug­gest­ing that the US could learn a les­son or two from Bei­jing on how to con­trol a pan­demic. Also mocked at have been the racial ten­sions and the ri­ot­ing that have scarred the US in the wake of the pan­demic and the re­sul­tant eco­nomic hard­ship.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, through it all, most of the US vit­riol has tar­geted the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party (CCP), not the Chi­nese na­tion.</p>
    <p>In a land­mark speech in July at the Nixon Pres­i­den­tial Li­brary, Mr Pom­peo de­clared that the “free world must tri­umph over this new tyranny”. At the Asean fo­rum ear­lier this month, he un­der­lined US “com­mit­ment to speak out in the face of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party’s es­ca­lat­ing ag­gres­sion and threats to sov­er­eign na­tions”.</p>
    <p>This week, As­sis­tant Sec­re­tary of State for East Asian and Pa­cific Af­fairs David Stil­well be­gan his tes­ti­mony to the Se­nate For­eign Re­la­tions Com­mit­tee by say­ing he was there to “dis­cuss the threat posed by the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party to the US and the global or­der” in three ge­o­graph­i­cal re­gions, be­fore go­ing on to say that “it is now clear to us, and to more and more coun­tries around the world, that the CCP un­der gen­eral sec­re­tary Xi Jin­ping... seeks to dis­rupt and re­shape the in­ter­na­tional en­vi­ron­ment around the nar­row self-cen­tred in­ter­ests and au­thor­i­tar­ian val­ues of a sin­gle ben­e­fi­ciary, the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party”.</p>
    <p>Just as the US has tried to sep­a­rate the CCP from the Chi­nese peo­ple, Mr Trump and Mr Xi have been care­ful to not throw barbs di­rectly at each other.</p>
    <p>In­deed, Mr Trump has claimed to have a “tremen­dous re­la­tion­ship” with Mr Xi and he has de­scribed Mr Xi as a “man who truly loves his coun­try” and is “ex­tremely ca­pa­ble”. He has also stressed that the two will be friends “no mat­ter what hap­pens with our dis­pute on trade”, and he also has spo­ken of his lik­ing and “great re­spect” for China. On the other side, Chi­nese anger seems to be largely di­rected at Mr Pom­peo, rather than his boss.</p>
    <p>At a re­cent panel dis­cus­sion I mod­er­ated for the Fu­ture-China Global Fo­rum, I asked Pro­fes­sor Ran­dall Kroszner, former mem­ber of the board of gov­er­nors of the Fed­eral Re­serve Sys­tem and who cur­rently serves on the ad­vi­sory board of the Paul­son In­sti­tute, which works to pro­mote US-China ties, whether he saw wig­gle room for a patch-up af­ter the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“Ul­ti­mately, there’s an un­der­stand­ing that ma­jor eco­nomic and mil­i­tary pow­ers need to have con­nec­tions, need to be able to talk and work with each other,” Prof Kroszner re­sponded. “There is a lot of ma­noeu­vring and pos­tur­ing that’s go­ing on right now, but I don’t think any­one wants to burn any bridges. They want to make sure the bridges are still there, even if there are some block­ades now.</p>
    <p>“(That said) I don’t see those ob­sta­cles be­ing re­moved right now.”</p>
    <p>For now, of course, it does look as though things will get worse be­fore they get better.</p>
    <p>In July, the US shifted po­si­tion on the South China Sea, pro­claim­ing that it held as il­le­gal all of China’s claims out­side its ter­ri­to­rial wa­ters. This has em­bold­ened some, Viet­nam and the Philip­pines par­tic­u­larly, to be more as­sertive with China over the South China Sea dis­pute.</p>
    <p>Still, some in Asean sus­pect a cer­tain fak­ery in all this, a sense that a lot of the noise com­ing from the US is mere pos­tur­ing. There are few il­lu­sions about China ei­ther.</p>
    <p>In­deed, the lull in as­sertive Chi­nese be­hav­iour in the South China Sea wit­nessed in the lead-up to the Asean min­is­te­rial meet and fo­rums is gen­er­ally seen as noth­ing more than tem­po­rary eas­ing of pres­sure to get a “good meet­ing”.</p>
    <p>Malaysian For­eign Min­is­ter Hisham­mud­din Hus­sein spoke for many when he said the South China Sea is­sue “must be man­aged and re­solved in a ra­tio­nal man­ner” and Asean has to “look at all av­enues, all ap­proaches, to en­sure our re­gion is not com­pli­cated fur­ther by other pow­ers”.</p>
    <p>In­deed, some even think Mr Trump is ca­pa­ble of do­ing a deal with Bei­jing the week af­ter elec­tion day, should he win.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, the latest it­er­a­tion of the TikTok deal is be­ing called by some an­a­lysts as a wa­tered-down ver­sion of what Mr Trump orig­i­nally sought to de­mand, some­thing that had been on the ta­ble months ago, al­though it is not quite clear if China could live with it.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, it is not lost that China has held back on an­nounc­ing its own black­list of US firms – “un­re­li­able en­tity list” as it is called, al­though its in­ten­tions were an­nounced more than a year ago.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing is said to be stay­ing its hand to both not ex­ac­er­bate ten­sions, as well as to wait for the US elec­tion re­sults. While the doc­u­ment ex­plain­ing the un­re­li­able en­tity list is 1,500 char­ac­ters long, the at­tached clarificat­ions are dou­ble in length – sug­gest­ing much of this is shadow play.</p>
    <p>If a deal needs to be made, the Pom­peos and Pot­tingers can al­ways be switched out and more mod­er­ate voices brought in; Mr Trump does not shrink from let­ting peo­ple go. In­deed, given that he is said to har­bour am­bi­tions about a 2024 pres­i­den­tial run, it might even help Mr Pom­peo’s po­lit­i­cal ca­reer to be made a ca­su­alty of a rap­proche­ment with China, so he can dis­tance him­self from the deal.</p>
    <p>Still, it hardly needs to be said that Mr Trump is ca­pa­ble of bust­ing ev­ery code in the book, spo­ken or un­spo­ken. With the elec­tion loom­ing and his own stand­ing in pre-elec­tion sur­veys not look­ing too promis­ing, he let fly this week at the United Na­tions, re­turn­ing to his “China virus” theme, boast­ing about three US-de­vel­oped vac­cines in Phase III tri­als, and the un­prece­dented rear­ma­ment of Amer­ica un­der his watch. Amer­ica’s weapons, he de­clared, “are at an ad­vanced level, like we’ve never had be­fore, like, frankly, we’ve never even thought of hav­ing be­fore”.</p>
    <p>Judg­ing from Chi­nese me­dia, Bei­jing read it for what it was; while made to a global au­di­ence, the speech was tar­geted at the do­mes­tic vot­ing public. Nev­er­the­less, it did not go without a re­sponse.</p>
    <p>An ed­i­to­rial com­ment in the Global Times on Wed­nes­day re­minded Mr Trump that the “hys­ter­i­cal at­tack on China vi­o­lated the diplo­matic eti­quette a top leader is sup­posed to have”.</p>
    <p>In short, never omit to leave that bit of mar­gin for a fu­ture rec­on­cil­i­a­tion.</p>
    <p>There’s no spe­cial ge­nius, and even less re­ward, in the ac­ri­mo­nious ex­changes that are caus­ing a tail­spin in ties be­tween the world’s two big­gest mil­i­tary pow­ers and economies. If any­thing, it be­speaks dan­ger­ous brinkman­ship as a once-over­whelm­ingly dom­i­nant hege­mon con­fronts a res­o­lute chal­lenger now pick­ing a cue or two from its own play­book on how to throw weight around.</p>
