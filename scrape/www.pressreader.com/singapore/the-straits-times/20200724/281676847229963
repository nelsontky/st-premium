    <p>Q Not all vac­cines are 100 per cent ef­fec­tive. If one is about 70 per cent ef­fec­tive, would that be good enough?</p>
    <p>PRO­FES­SOR OOI ENG EONG:</p>
    <p>70 per cent ef­fec­tive­ness is ac­tu­ally very good. You know, even a nat­u­ral in­fec­tion would not give you 100 per cent pro­tec­tion from a sec­ond in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Whether Covid gives you life­long pro­tec­tion or short-lived pro­tec­tion, that is some­thing that is be­ing de­bated… The way the vac­cine works is it isn’t just at the in­di­vid­ual level.</p>
    <p>So, the per­son who falls into the 70 per cent and is pro­tected against in­fec­tion, that is great, they won’t get it. But ac­tu­ally, they go on to pro­tect the oth­ers who don’t ac­tu­ally de­velop im­mu­nity, and that is this whole con­cept of herd im­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Q When a vac­cine is found, who should get it first?</p>
    <p>PRO­FES­SOR DALE FISHER: Once we get a vac­cine, we are not go­ing to sud­denly get enough for the whole coun­try. So, we might have to dis­cuss: Do we vac­ci­nate older peo­ple or those that are im­mune-sup­pressed, or do we vac­ci­nate those that are look­ing af­ter them?</p>
    <p>Nearly all the nurs­ing home out­breaks, for ex­am­ple, are a re­sult of a staff mem­ber in­tro­duc­ing it (the virus). So, this is an im­por­tant dis­cus­sion be­cause you might think, let’s just vac­ci­nate all the im­mune-sup­pressed and the el­derly, but that may not be the most ra­tio­nal thing... I would cer­tainly like to vac­ci­nate all the peo­ple that work in a nurs­ing home.</p>
