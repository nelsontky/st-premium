    <p>LON­DON • Lawyers for Manch­ester United cap­tain Harry Maguire have ap­pealed against a Greek court rul­ing which found him guilty of mul­ti­ple charges fol­low­ing a brawl on the glitzy is­land of Mykonos last week, sources close to the process told Reuters.</p>
    <p>“Yes, Maguire’s lawyer, Alexis Anag­nos­takis, has sub­mit­ted an ap­peal,” one of the sources said yes­ter­day, in­sist­ing that the ac­cu­sa­tions were “wrong and mis­lead­ing”.</p>
    <p>The Eng­land de­fender was one of three peo­ple ar­rested last Thurs­day af­ter an al­ter­ca­tion with po­lice on Mykonos.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, a court in the nearby is­land of Sy­ros handed him a sus­pended sen­tence of 21 months and 10 days on charges of re­peated bod­ily harm, at­tempted bribery, vi­o­lence against pub­lic em­ploy­ees and in­sult, court of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Bri­tish tabloids, Maguire had “gone to the aid of his sis­ter Daisy, who fainted on a night out in Mykonos af­ter be­ing in­jected with a date-rape drug by ‘two Al­ba­ni­ans’, who then fled”, re­sult­ing in the al­ter­ca­tion and sub­se­quent ar­rest.</p>
    <p>He has denied the charges against him.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment af­ter the ver­dict was an­nounced, he said: “I re­main strong and con­fi­dent re­gard­ing our in­no­cence in this mat­ter – if any­thing my­self, fam­ily and friends are the vic­tims.”</p>
    <p>He also posted an im­age on his In­sta­gram page that had a quote from Buddha, which read: “Three things that can­not be hidden: the sun, the moon and the truth.”</p>
    <p>Maguire’s ap­peal is ex­pected to be heard be­fore Sept 19, which is when United kick off the new Premier League sea­son. Along with Manch­ester City, the Red Devils have been given spe­cial dis­pen­sa­tion to start their term later than the other English top-flight clubs due to their Euro­pean ex­er­tions.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Daily Mail, man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer has “no im­me­di­ate plans to re­move him from the cap­taincy”, al­though club hi­er­ar­chy will speak to him about the ar­rest and con­vic­tions.</p>
    <p>There may also be a chance that the con­vic­tions be over­turned af­ter Yoan­nis Par­adis­sis, the pros­e­cu­tor rep­re­sent­ing the Greek po­lice­men in­volved in the event, yes­ter­day told the BBC an apol­ogy might suf­fice.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing on its Ra­dio 4 To­day pro­gramme, he said: “I be­lieve that there is still time for the three de­fen­dants to say they are sorry, and then I be­lieve the out­come might be dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know (if the Greek au­thor­i­ties will ac­cept this), but they told me they are still wait­ing for an apol­ogy and they haven’t heard any.</p>
    <p>“This is what I find quite shock­ing and quite un­sports­man­like.”</p>
    <p>Par­adis­sis also in­sisted Daisy had not men­tioned any­thing about the drug­ging at­tempt when quizzed by po­lice.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Eng­land coach Gareth South­gate has since with­drawn the 27-year-old from his squad for next month’s Na­tions League matches against Ice­land and Den­mark.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing spo­ken to Manch­ester United and the player, I have made this de­ci­sion in the best in­ter­ests of all par­ties and with con­sid­er­a­tion of the im­pact on our prepa­ra­tions for next week,” he said.</p>
    <p>BRIBERY CHARGE</p>
    <p>Do you know who I am? I am the cap­tain of Manch­ester United, I am very rich, I can give you money, I can pay you, please let us go. ’’</p>
