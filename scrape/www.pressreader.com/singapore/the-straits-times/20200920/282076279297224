    <p>Ever­ton striker Do­minic Calvert-Lewin scored his first se­nior hat-trick in yes­ter­day’s 5-2 maul­ing of 10-man West Bromwich Al­bion, as the Tof­fees sug­gested they could be a real threat for the Euro­pean places this sea­son.</p>
    <p>With a vastly im­proved mid­field that in­cludes new sign­ing James Ro­driguez, Ever­ton cre­ated 32 goal at­tempts in their open­ing two Premier League matches. Four of them were con­verted by Calvert-Lewin, the match-win­ner at Tot­ten­ham Hot­spur last week­end.</p>
    <p>For the first time since the 2012-13 sea­son, Ever­ton – who fin­ished 12th last term – have reg­is­tered back-to-back wins at the start of a top-flight cam­paign.</p>
    <p>“The play­ers have come back with more ambition and mo­ti­va­tion. The new sign­ings have helped us be more mo­ti­vated. Good mo­men­tum for us,” said Ever­ton boss Carlo Ancelotti, whose also started new boys Ab­doulaye Doucoure and Al­lan in mid­field.</p>
    <p>“I’m re­ally pleased for James Ro­driguez. A new coun­try, a new league – it was not so easy.</p>
    <p>“But he made it easy be­cause he has a lot of qual­ity. A fan­tas­tic player.</p>
    <p>“Do­minic Calvert-Lewin has de­vel­oped re­ally well. He’s work­ing re­ally well, more con­fi­dence.”</p>
    <p>Play­maker Ro­driguez im­pressed with his vi­sion and tech­nique against Spurs and backed that per­for­mance up by get­ting in­volved in three of the hosts’ five goals.</p>
    <p>It all started well for the vis­i­tors when Grady Dian­gana fired past Jor­dan Pick­ford af­ter run­ning 60 me­tres for his first top-flight goal, and they might have been 2-0 up when Jake Liver­more struck a post.</p>
    <p>But, when Calvert-Lewin equalised fol­low­ing an in­ter­ven­tion from the Video As­sis­tant Ref­eree, Ever­ton took con­trol.</p>
    <p>They scored five goals in 35 min­utes as West Brom ca­pit­u­lated fol­low­ing a need­less red card for de­fender Kieran Gibbs for push­ing Ro­driguez i n the face. Ro­driguez whipped Ever­ton in front from the edge of the box, be­fore Bag­gies boss Slaven Bilic was sent off by ref­eree Mike Dean for his ve­he­ment com­plaints at half-time.</p>
    <p>West Brom equalised min­utes into the sec­ond pe­riod with a free kick from Matheus Pereira, but Michael Keane re­stored Ever­ton’s lead with a tap-in.</p>
    <p>Ro­driguez’s pass then put Richarli­son be­hind the West Brom de­fence and his cross was bun­dled in by Calvert-Lewin. The striker com­pleted his hat-trick with a header from Lu­cas Digne’s cor­ner.</p>
    <p>“You look at the qual­ity we have got on the ball, it was im­por­tant we utilised the ex­tra man,” said Calvert-Lewin, 23.</p>
    <p>“We cre­ated space and chances, and I was happy to be in the box to tap them in.”</p>
    <p>He hailed the i mpact of Ancelotti, who is help­ing him hone his preda­tory in­stincts in the box.</p>
    <p>“He’s on me ev­ery day for one­touch fin­ishes and be­ing in the box to put the ball in the back of the net,” he added. “It’s nice to know that what I am work­ing on in train­ing is com­ing off.”</p>
    <p>Leeds were in­volved in an­other 4-3 thriller yes­ter­day, this time beat­ing fel­low newly pro­moted out­fit Ful­ham at El­land Road.</p>
    <p>Leeds let a 4-1 lead slip but hung on for their first points af­ter los­ing to cham­pi­ons Liver­pool last week.</p>
    <p>He’s on me ev­ery day for one-touch fin­ishes and be­ing in the box to put the ball in the back of the net. It’s nice to know that what I am work­ing on in train­ing is com­ing off.</p>
