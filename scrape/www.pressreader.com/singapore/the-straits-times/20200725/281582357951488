    <p>The Na­tional Day Is­tana Open House will be held on­line this year, with vis­i­tors get­ting a tour of rarely seen fea­tures such as an air-raid shel­ter lo­cated in a cel­lar. The hour-long event will be hosted on Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob’s Face­book and Instagram plat­forms on Aug 2 from 10am. It will also, for the first time, be open to ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Day Is­tana Open House will be held on­line this year, with vis­i­tors get­ting a tour of rarely-seen fea­tures such as an air­raid shel­ter lo­cated in a cel­lar.</p>
    <p>Known as the Bunker, it was refuge for staff of the Gov­ern­ment House (as the Is­tana was pre­vi­ously known) dur­ing World War II.</p>
    <p>An­other fea­ture typ­i­cally closed to the pub­lic is a 14.5m-deep well that sits on the side of the Is­tana’s main build­ing.</p>
    <p>It was likely built in 1869 by In­di­ans who were con­victs here, and who were in­volved in the con­struc­tion of the Gov­ern­ment House.</p>
    <p>The hour-long event will be hosted on Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob’s Face­book and Instagram plat­forms on Aug 2 from 10am, one week be­fore Na­tional Day.</p>
    <p>Un­like the Hari Raya Aidil­fitri vir­tual Is­tana Open House in May, which was lim­ited to in­vited guests, the Na­tional Day event will, for the first time, be open to ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>The event is be­ing hosted on­line amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, with the mul­ti­me­dia tour or­gan­ised by The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The vir­tual Open House will also in­clude seg­ments hosted by the Na­tional Mu­seum of Sin­ga­pore and the Asian Civil­i­sa­tions Mu­seum.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors can in­ter­act with an arte­fact from the Na­tional Mu­seum in a cu­rated dig­i­tal space called Zoom into His­tory, while the Asian Civil­i­sa­tions Mu­seum will present sneak pre­views of its vir­tual gal­leries and Na­tional Day pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Day Pa­rade 2020 or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee will also in­tro­duce the Our Heart for Sin­ga­pore project – which shares Sin­ga­pore­ans’ re­flec­tions, thanks, hopes and as­pi­ra­tions for the na­tion – dur­ing the vir­tual tour.</p>
    <p>Close to 150 ben­e­fi­cia­ries of the Pres­i­dent’s Chal­lenge and The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund will join Madam Hal­imah for the vir­tual visit via video­con­fer­enc­ing.</p>
