    </section>

    <p>In a col­umn, ed­i­to­rial writer Asad Latif muses on age­ing and dis­ease, as he re­mem­bers a woman in a wheel­chair he used to see in his Hous­ing Board es­tate. He re­calls: “She waved at ev­ery­one in­dis­crim­i­nately. No one was un­wor­thy of her de­men­tia-laced bene­dic­tion. Some waved back at her. The spar­row flew away.”</p>
    <p>Till about a year ago, I used to see an old woman sit­ting in a wheel­chair be­ing pushed by another woman, per­haps her sis­ter, around my HDB es­tate. The older woman waved at every passer-by who caught her eye, but her in­co­her­ent words were mum­bled even be­yond slur­ring. Their gur­gling sound did not re­sem­ble any lan­guage or di­alect that I could recog­nise. I tried to speak to her helper once, but I could not un­der­stand her re­ply.</p>
    <p>I do not see them any more. Per­haps the older woman is in in­sti­tu­tional care. Per­haps, well.</p>
    <p>What I re­mem­ber is the way in which she en­gaged the at­ten­tion of pass­ing strangers. A sin­gle wave of her frag­ile hand ar­rested the foot­steps of the gan­gly school­boy rush­ing off to tu­ition class, the de­mure teenage girl on her way to a ren­dezvous with the boyfriend, the mid­dle-aged woman car­ry­ing gro­ceries for yet another din­ner and the old man making his arthritic way home.</p>
    <p>Her wave beck­oned a tat­tooed young­ster headed to or from prison, a for­eign worker emerg­ing from a refuse bin cen­tre and a spar­row seek­ing morsels on the ground, rest­ing in the trees and wings in the sky.</p>
    <p>She waved at ev­ery­one in­dis­crim­i­nately. No one was un­wor­thy of her de­men­tia-laced bene­dic­tion. Some waved back at her. The spar­row flew away.</p>
    <p>In our in­di­vid­ual acts of recog­ni­tion and re­sponse, we paid her col­lec­tive homage. I per­son­ally do not know the school­boy, the teenager, the mid­dle-aged woman, the old man, the young­ster, the worker and the spar­row, any more than they know me. Like theirs, my so­cial ex­is­tence is frag­men­tary and episodic. My good­will is tem­po­rary be­cause my good days are pro­vi­sional.</p>
    <p>It took a gre­gar­i­ous sur­vivor of Lethean time to bring to­gether a fam­ily un­known to it­self.</p>
    <p>Who is she? She is life, that is, con­scious­ness har­nessed to flesh.</p>
    <p>Su­san Son­tag, a writer who made this con­nec­tion, had much to say about the un­savoury as­pects of the har­ness. There is dis­ease.</p>
    <p>“Ill­ness is the night-side of life, a more oner­ous cit­i­zen­ship. Ev­ery­one who is born holds dual cit­i­zen­ship in the king­dom of the well and in the king­dom of the sick,” she wrote.</p>
    <p>“Al­though we all pre­fer to use only the good passport, sooner or later each of us is obliged, at least for a spell, to iden­tify our­selves as cit­i­zens of that other place.”</p>
    <p>Dis­ease is not only a phys­i­cal af­flic­tion but also a so­cial con­di­tion. Son­tag de­con­structs the metaphors that as­so­ciate can­cer, Aids, syphilis and tu­ber­cu­lo­sis with life­style choices and moral fal­li­bil­ity. De­mys­ti­fy­ing those puni­tive as­so­ci­a­tions, she ar­gues boldly for a world in which af­flic­tions of the in­di­vid­ual flesh will not in­fect hu­mankind’s con­scious­ness of it­self as a phys­i­cal whole.</p>
    <p>Age and dis­ease are part­ners in the un­com­mit­ted crime called life. Nei­ther can be held guilty there­fore. In­stinc­tively, I took to the woman in the wheel­chair. It was a re­sponse born of habit.</p>
    <p>Forty years ago, I oc­ca­sion­ally fled the gilded in­tel­lec­tu­al­ism of Pres­i­dency Col­lege in Cal­cutta for the bro­ken ma­te­ri­al­ism of Cal­cutta Med­i­cal Col­lege, which lay but a few foot­steps away.</p>
    <p>Cured lep­ers formed the aris­toc­racy of the beg­ging streets be­tween the two iconic in­sti­tu­tions. When alms were not forth­com­ing, they stood up and held up their arms aloft. I laughed at the sight of re­spectable men emp­ty­ing their pock­ets at the hor­rid sight of the lep­ers. They never ac­costed me be­cause I greeted them al­ways and gave them what I could out of my stu­dent’s pocket money. I looked them al­ways in the eye. They ac­cepted me as a fel­low-hu­man.</p>
    <p>Once in the med­i­cal col­lege, my walks through the hospi­tal grounds at­tuned my ears to groans emerg­ing from what I be­lieve was the can­cer ward. That was mor­tal suf­fer­ing in ex­tremis. I was an un­happy mor­tal, a stu­dent of English Lit­er­a­ture seek­ing a life in an en­chanted Ben­gali world. But who had ap­proved of the re­la­tion­ship of the can­cer­suf­fer­ers with a world that they, like me, had not wronged?</p>
    <p>Cal­cutta’s Col­lege Street never ends. The woman in the wheel­chair is a part of my wan­der­ing life. She proves that no dis­ease is more pow­er­ful than the ame­lio­ra­tive agency of mem­ory. Mu­ta­tion ex­ists. At­tri­tion at­tends every step of woman and man. At­ro­phy is a part of the laws of na­ture. Dis­ease loves life.</p>
    <p>What mat­ters is the lived his­tory of the mind. Con­scious­ness, of one­self and of oth­ers, must never bow to its teth­er­ing to with­er­ing flesh. Here and now, I do not fear the de­cay of the body. We all are fair game for time. But so is time for us.</p>
    <p>It is in this spirit that the poet Wil­liam But­ler Yeats wrote of the sages: “Con­sume my heart away; sick with de­sire/And fas­tened to a dy­ing an­i­mal/It knows not what it is; and gather me/Into the ar­ti­fice of eter­nity.”</p>
    <p>Eter­nity is an ar­ti­fice, an imag­ined realm of de­sired time­less­ness. Only a heart fev­er­ish with de­sire, im­pris­oned in a dy­ing body, can en­vis­age eter­nity as a sanc­tu­ary ly­ing be­yond fleet­ing forms.</p>
    <p>A char­iot, a cy­cle, a car, a wheel­chair and a stretcher are the same. They are forms of move­ment. What mat­ters is the mind be­ing con­veyed from there to here to the hereafter.</p>
    <p>I do not know where the old woman is to­day. I miss the sight of her be­cause the fam­ily that she raised from a pass­ing wheel­chair fi­nally has dis­persed and dis­ap­peared. Young or old, Sin­ga­pore­ans or for­eign­ers, hu­mans or birds, we do not recog­nise one another any more. Our point of ref­er­ence has van­ished. But mem­ory re­mains.</p>
    <p>Eter­nity is an ar­ti­fice, an imag­ined realm of de­sired time­less­ness. Only a heart fev­er­ish with de­sire, im­pris­oned in a dy­ing body, can en­vis­age eter­nity as a sanc­tu­ary ly­ing be­yond fleet­ing forms</p>
