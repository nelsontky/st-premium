    <p>United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump is fac­ing al­le­ga­tions he paid lit­tle or no in­come tax for years be­fore he came to power, as his cloudy fi­nan­cial past stoked con­tro­versy ahead of the first elec­tion de­bate.</p>
    <p>The New York Times al­leged the bil­lion­aire Pres­i­dent paid just US$750 (S$1,030) in fed­eral in­come taxes in 2016, the year he won the White House, and no in­come taxes at all in 10 of the pre­vi­ous 15 years be­cause he re­ported los­ing more money than he made.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, who dis­missed the ac­cu­sa­tions as “to­tally fake news”, is ready­ing to come face to face with his Demo­cratic op­po­nent Joe Bi­den in a live de­bate to­day.</p>
    <p>The New York Times said tax data span­ning over 20 years “re­veal the hol­low­ness, but also the wiz­ardry, be­hind the self-made-bil­lion­aire im­age” of the Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASHINGTON Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump paid just US$750 (S$1,030) in US in­come taxes in both 2016 and 2017, re­ported los­ing mil­lions of dol­lars from his golf cour­ses and has hun­dreds of mil­lions in debt that will come due in the next few years, ac­cord­ing to a re­port in the New York Times.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump paid no in­come taxes in 10 of the past 15 years be­cause he gen­er­ated large losses that off­set any money that he made, ac­cord­ing to the Times analysis of at least two decades worth of Mr Trump’s per­sonal and busi­ness tax re­turns.</p>
    <p>The doc­u­ments show many of Mr Trump’s busi­nesses are strug­gling, with him putting more money into the firms than he is tak­ing out, the re­port said. It also said he earned US$73 mil­lion abroad in his first two years in the White House, in­clud­ing from coun­tries such as the Philip­pines and Turkey, de­spite a pledge that he would pur­sue no new for­eign deals while pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump said at a press con­fer­ence on Sun­day that the re­port is “to­tally fake news”, adding “I pay a lot” but with­out of­fer­ing specifics.</p>
    <p>“They’re un­der au­dit and when they’re not, I would be proud to show you,” Mr Trump said.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump bucked tra­di­tion in re­fus­ing to re­lease his per­sonal tax records, which had be­come stan­dard among can­di­dates for of­fice in re­cent decades. House Democrats have is­sued sub­poe­nas for the doc­u­ments, which have been mired in le­gal bat­tles for more than a year. The Supreme Court said in July that lower courts needed to do more to scru­ti­nise the tax re­turn re­quests.</p>
    <p>The Times did not dis­close how it got the doc­u­ments, but said they came from sources with le­gal ac­cess to the in­for­ma­tion. A lawyer for Trump Or­gan­i­sa­tion told the Times that “most, if not all, of the facts ap­pear to be in­ac­cu­rate”.</p>
    <p>The rev­e­la­tions about Mr Trump’s fi­nan­cial life are likely to be a key point of con­tention head­ing into the fi­nal month of the pres­i­den­tial cam­paign. Mr Trump, who has built his public im­age as a suc­cess­ful busi­ness­man and as a bil­lion­aire, faces a se­ries of fi­nan­cial chal­lenges, ac­cord­ing to the Times.</p>
    <p>To­tally fake news. PRES­I­DENT DON­ALD TRUMP</p>
    <p>I paid a lot and I paid a lot of state in­come taxes too... It’ll all be re­vealed.</p>
    <p>MR TRUMP, in re­ac­tion to the New York Times story.</p>
    <p>LOANS COM­ING DUE</p>
    <p>His rev­enue from the NBC tele­vi­sion se­ries The Ap­pren­tice and from li­cens­ing deals is dry­ing up. Sev­eral years ago, he sold nearly all the stocks that now might have helped him plug holes in his strug­gling prop­er­ties, the Times re­ported. Within the next four years, more than US$300 mil­lion in loans – obli­ga­tions for which Mr Trump is per­son­ally re­spon­si­ble – will come due, the news­pa­per said.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has pre­vi­ously said his tax re­turns are “very beau­ti­ful”, but he can­not re­lease the doc­u­ments while they are un­der au­dit at the In­ter­nal Rev­enue Ser­vice (IRS).</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent also in­di­cated he pre­ferred to min­imise his tax bill, say­ing in a 2016 pres­i­den­tial de­bate it made him “smart”.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s pick to run the IRS, Mr Chuck Ret­tig, has said there is no pro­hi­bi­tion on mak­ing the doc­u­ments public while an au­dit is on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>The Times em­pha­sised the doc­u­ments re­veal only what Mr Trump told the gov­ern­ment about his busi­nesses, and did not dis­close his true wealth.</p>
    <p>The re­port found that Mr Trump has writ­ten off a long list of things he clas­si­fied as busi­ness ex­penses, in­clud­ing US$70,000 to his hair stylist while ap­pear­ing on The Ap­pren­tice, and more than US$95,000 for hair and makeup ser­vices for his daugh­ter, Ivanka Trump, who is now a top White House aide.</p>
    <p>The Times also re­ported that Mr Trump has treated an es­tate in</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­one ‘who paid more in fed­eral in­come tax than Pres­i­dent Trump’ raise their hand.</p>
    <p>SE­NIOR DEMO­CRAT CHUCK SCHUMER, on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>Westch­ester County, New York, as an in­vest­ment prop­erty for tax pur­poses, de­spite list­ing it as a “re­treat for the Trump fam­ily”.</p>
    <p>CON­SULT­ING FEES</p>
    <p>The Times re­port also found that Mr Trump may be us­ing con­sult­ing fees as a way to pay his chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Be­tween 2010 and 2018, he de­ducted US$26 mil­lion in “con­sult­ing fees” as a busi­ness ex­pense. On her fi­nan­cial dis­clo­sure forms, Ms Ivanka Trump has re­ported con­sult­ing in­come that matched the fig­ures on the tax re­turns.</p>
    <p>That could po­ten­tially run afoul of IRS rules pro­hibit­ing ex­or­bi­tantly over­pay­ing con­sul­tants or reg­u­la­tions against skirt­ing gift and in­her­i­tance taxes.</p>
    <p>“It ap­pears that the Pres­i­dent has gamed the tax code to his ad­van­tage and used le­gal fights to de­lay or avoid pay­ing what he owes,” House Ways and Means chair­man Richard Neal said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Neal’s com­mit­tee is en­gaged in on­go­ing lit­i­ga­tion to ob­tain Mr Trump’s tax re­turns.</p>
    <p>Since be­com­ing pres­i­dent, Mr Trump has seen an in­crease in de­mand from some busi­ness groups for events and con­fer­ences at his Mar-a-Lago re­sort in Palm Beach, Florida, his Washington ho­tel, and the Do­ral re­sort in Mi­ami.</p>
    <p>Bank of Amer­ica, the US Cham­ber of Com­merce, and the Billy Gra­ham Evan­ge­lis­tic As­so­ci­a­tion are among var­i­ous or­gan­i­sa­tions that have hosted events at Trump prop­er­ties in re­cent years, the Times doc­u­ments show.</p>
    <p>It ap­pears that the Pres­i­dent has gamed the tax code to his ad­van­tage and used le­gal fights to de­lay or avoid pay­ing what he owes.</p>
