    <p>The Na­tional Foot­ball League (NFL) warned teams on Wed­nes­day they could face tougher penal­ties for fu­ture vi­o­la­tions of coro­n­avirus safety pro­to­cols as the league was forced to post­pone a reg­u­lar sea­son fix­ture for the first time.</p>
    <p>In a memo sent to all 32 teams con­cern­ing the is­sue of face cov­er­ings, NFL vice-pres­i­dent of foot­ball op­er­a­tions Troy Vin­cent said teams risked sus­pen­sions and for­fei­ture of draft picks if pro­to­cols were breached.</p>
    <p>The league has is­sued fines to­talling over US$1 mil­lion (S$1.4 mil­lion) af­ter sev­eral coaches were seen not wear­ing face cov­er­ings on the side­lines dur­ing the open­ing weeks of the new sea­son.</p>
    <p>In his memo on Wed­nes­day, Vin­cent warned that the league was con­cerned that the “wear­ing of pro­tec­tive equip­ment is still not uni­ver­sal”, cre­at­ing an “un­nec­es­sary risk to game day par­tic­i­pants”.</p>
    <p>“We are only through Week 3 of the sea­son,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>“If we are to play a full and un­in­ter­rupted sea­son, we all must re­main com­mit­ted to our ef­forts to mit­i­gate the risk of trans­mis­sion of the virus.</p>
    <p>“In­con­sis­tent ad­her­ence to health and safety pro­to­cols, such as wear­ing face cov­er­ings and ob­serv­ing phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing re­quire­ments will put the 2020 sea­son at risk.</p>
    <p>“A fail­ure to ad­here to the ne­go­ti­ated pro­to­cols or to govern­ment di­rec­tives can have an ad­verse im­pact on both other play­ers or staff mem­bers of your club, and of other clubs.”</p>
    <p>The lat­est warn­ing came as the NFL was forced to resched­ule Sun­day’s fix­ture be­tween the Pitts­burgh Steel­ers and Ten­nessee Ti­tans.</p>
    <p>The game will now take place on Mon­day or Tues­day next week.</p>
    <p>The post­pone­ment came af­ter the Ti­tans re­vealed that eight em­ploy­ees had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Four play­ers re­turned pos­i­tive tests as the NFL shut down the team fa­cil­ity. The Ti­tans also re­ported five pos­i­tive tests among team per­son­nel.</p>
    <p>It is the first sig­nif­i­cant out­break of the virus to hit the new NFL sea­son, which got un­der way ear­lier this month with teams play­ing at their own sta­di­ums rather than in an NBA-style “bub­ble”, which saw the Na­tional Basketball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) play-off con­tenders gath­er­ing in Or­lando, Florida.</p>
    <p>Vin­cent, who has sent two warn­ings about the im­por­tance of abid­ing by safety pro­to­cols, said in his lat­est memo on Wed­nes­day that the league would con­tinue to crack down on vi­o­la­tions.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tinue to ad­dress lack of com­pli­ance with ac­count­abil­ity mea­sures that may also in­clude sus­pen­sions of per­sons in­volved, and/or the for­fei­ture of a draft choice(s),” he wrote.</p>
