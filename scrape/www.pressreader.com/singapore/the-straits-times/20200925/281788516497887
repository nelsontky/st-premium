    <p>OT­TAWA • Canada has en­tered a sec­ond wave of the coronaviru­s pan­demic, Prime Min­is­ter Justin Trudeau has said, warning that the coun­try was on the brink of a surge that could be worse than what hap­pened in spring if peo­ple did not fol­low public health guide­lines.</p>
    <p>In a na­tional ad­dress on Wed­nes­day, Mr Trudeau said Canada “is at a cross­roads” as a sec­ond wave emerges in four large prov­inces, adding that the gov­ern­ment would do what­ever it takes to help the coun­try re­cover from the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Canada’s Covid-19 cases have spiked in re­cent days, with an av­er­age of 1,123 new cases re­ported daily over the past week, com­pared with a daily av­er­age of 380 cases in the mid­dle of last month.</p>
    <p>“We have the power to get this sec­ond wave un­der con­trol. I know we can do it, be­cause we’ve al­ready done it once be­fore,” said Mr Trudeau.</p>
    <p>Canada’s to­tal num­ber of in­fec­tions reached 147,753, while 9,243 peo­ple have died, ac­cord­ing to latest gov­ern­ment data.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, 982,698 peo­ple have died of Covid-19 as at yes­ter­day, ac­cord­ing to Worl­dome­ters.</p>
    <p>Cana­di­ans are now more wor­ried about Covid-19 than they have been since April, an Aba­cus Data poll showed.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has also made com­mit­ments i n the so-called Speech from the Throne, which lays out its agenda for the next par­lia­men­tary ses­sion, and promised to re­cover more than a mil­lion jobs lost dur­ing the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Since the coronaviru­s ar­rived in Canada ear­lier this year, the gov­ern­ment has been grap­pling with high un­em­ploy­ment, a soar­ing bud­get short­fall and an un­cer­tain fu­ture for many of Canada’s busi­nesses, par­tic­u­larly in the eco­nom­i­cally im­por­tant oil and gas sec­tor.</p>
    <p>With the rise of Covid-19 cases in re­cent weeks, some prov­inces have re­vived re­stric­tions, lead­ing to con­cerns of even more eco­nomic woes.</p>
    <p>“This is not the time for aus­ter­ity,” the gov­ern­ment said in the speech.</p>
    <p>The range of prom­ises and men­tions of sig­nif­i­cant in­vest­ments could up­set mar­kets show­ing signs of ner­vous­ness about soar­ing bud­get deficits and debt. Canada lost one of its cov­eted triple-A rat­ings in June when Fitch down­graded it for the first time, cit­ing the spend­ing.</p>
    <p>In his ad­dress, Mr Trudeau said low in­ter­est rates meant the gov­ern­ment could af­ford the promised spend­ing. “Do­ing less would mean a slower re­cov­ery and big­ger deficits in the long run,” he said, adding that long-term spend­ing would be fis­cally sus­tain­able.</p>
    <p>Canada’s bud­get deficit this fis­cal year is fore­cast to hit C$343.2 bil­lion (S$352.8 bil­lion), based on spend­ing mea­sures al­ready an­nounced. This would be the largest bud­get deficit since World War II.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of man­age­ment Ian Lee from Ot­tawa’s Car­leton University said the speech rep­re­sented a “very high-risk bet” by Mr Trudeau. “He’s gam­bling this mas­sive in­crease in ex­pen­di­tures is go­ing to gen­er­ate very sub­stan­tial growth,” said Prof Lee.</p>
    <p>The speech is a par­lia­men­tary mea­sure of con­fi­dence, and, given that the Lib­er­als have only a mi­nor­ity in the House of Com­mons, they will need the sup­port of op­po­si­tion leg­is­la­tors to avoid be­ing top­pled and plung­ing the coun­try into an elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The left-lean­ing New Democrats – who had in­di­cated they might vote in favour – said the pro­pos­als did not of­fer enough sup­port to Cana­di­ans.</p>
    <p>Party leader Jag­meet Singh said he did not want to force an elec­tion, adding that his team would take “a lot of time” to de­cide what to do. A for­mal vote is likely next month.</p>
    <p>The Con­ser­va­tives, the largest op­po­si­tion group, con­firmed ex­pec­ta­tions that they would not back the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The Trudeau gov­ern­ment said it is also stick­ing to the goal of fight­ing cli­mate change and promised money to retro­fit build­ings and make zero-emis­sions ve­hi­cles more widely avail­able.</p>
    <p>The Lib­er­als also vowed to make sig­nif­i­cant in­vest­ments in child­care and said they would ex­tend an ex­ist­ing wage sub­sidy mea­sure un­til next sum­mer.</p>
    <p>The speech made no spe­cific spend­ing com­mit­ments or fis­cal pro­jec­tions, some of which will be dis­closed in a fis­cal up­date later this year.</p>
