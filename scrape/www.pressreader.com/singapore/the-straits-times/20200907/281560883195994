    <p>Many lo­cal small and medium-sized en­ter­prises have es­tab­lished sur­gi­cal and re­us­able mask man­u­fac­tur­ing fa­cil­i­ties in Sin­ga­pore since the on­set of the coron­avirus out­break. Mask pro­duc­tion is a new rev­enue source for them and has in­creased lo­cal pro­duc­tion ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal print­ing com­pany AVS Tech­nolo­gies faced dif­fi­cul­ties sourc­ing sur­gi­cal masks for its work­ers ear­lier this year, but meet­ing that chal­lenge has gen­er­ated a new rev­enue stream for the busi­ness.</p>
    <p>It set up a pro­duc­tion fa­cil­ity – three ma­chines to pro­duce adul­tand child-size masks – that be­came op­er­a­tional in May, with the ca­pac­ity to pro­duce about five mil­lion masks a month.</p>
    <p>“We went in blind dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod. We asked our staff in China to help us source the ma­chines and ship them over to Sin­ga­pore, and con­verted a stor­age fa­cil­ity (for pro­duc­tion),” AVS Tech­nolo­gies gen­eral man­ager Kelvin Mun told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The com­pany is among sev­eral lo­cal busi­nesses that have branched out into mask pro­duc­tion as a new rev­enue source amid the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>AVS Tech­nolo­gies, which dis­trib­utes dig­i­tal print­ing prod­ucts and pro­vides ser­vices such as 3D print­ing and CNC (com­puter nu­mer­i­cal con­trol) milling, has in­vested close to $1 mil­lion to get its WellM brand of sur­gi­cal masks off the ground.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try (MTI) said the out­break is show­ing how op­por­tu­ni­ties can emerge from dif­fi­cult times.</p>
    <p>Many lo­cal small and medi­um­sized en­ter­prises have es­tab­lished sur­gi­cal and re­us­able mask man­u­fac­tur­ing fa­cil­i­ties here since the on­set of the virus out­break. This has in­creased lo­cal pro­duc­tion ca­pac­ity, the spokesman said, cit­ing med­i­cal con­tract man­u­fac­turer Racer Tech­nol­ogy as one such com­pany.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment agen­cies such as the Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search, the Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Board and En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore have been ad­vis­ing com­pa­nies on set­ting up man­u­fac­tur­ing fa­cil­i­ties and the in­ter­na­tion­ally recog­nised stan­dards that ap­ply to sur­gi­cal masks and N95 res­pi­ra­tors, the MTI spokesman added.</p>
    <p>Mr Mun said the next step for the AVS mask busi­ness is to widen its over­seas reach – it ex­ports to Malaysia and Canada, and is set­ting up sales chan­nels and ob­tain­ing test­ing ap­proval in the United States.</p>
    <p>“We set up our mask man­u­fac­tur­ing as a long-term plan, and are look­ing at op­por­tu­ni­ties to move into med­i­cal man­u­fac­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>“(In the past few months) when the print­ing busi­ness was quite quiet, the mask pro­duc­tion... helped to grow and sta­bilise the com­pany,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, med­i­cal equip­ment com­pany Mo­har Med­i­cal has been pro­duc­ing sur­gi­cal masks at its fa­cil­ity here, with a ca­pac­ity of up to two mil­lion a month, since May.</p>
    <p>In­vest­ment firm DIP In­vest­ments, which wholly owns the brand, in­vested a six-fig­ure sum that it will re­coup “within the next month”, said Mo­har Med­i­cal man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Jaslyn Kaur.</p>
    <p>DIP In­vest­ments plans to in­vest in a sec­ond man­u­fac­tur­ing plant in South-east Asia within the next year, in re­sponse to ex­port in­quiries for five mil­lion to 10 mil­lion masks over the next two months, she said, adding that Mo­har Med­i­cal will add gloves and hand sani­tiser to its prod­uct range by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>Gam­ing com­pany Razer, which has been dis­pens­ing its lo­cally pro­duced masks through vend­ing ma­chines here since June, said its pro­duc­tion ca­pac­ity is five mil­lion masks a month, but it has the ca­pa­bil­ity to dou­ble this.</p>
    <p>The ca­pac­ity was set up so the com­pany could meet in­creased de­mand in the fu­ture; it has no plans to ex­pand its pro­duc­tion fa­cil­ity for now, a spokesman said.</p>
    <p>“Our fo­cus re­mains on en­sur­ing suf­fi­cient sup­ply of masks in the re­gion, and we are still eval­u­at­ing the long-term plan for our mask pro­duc­tion lines,” he added.</p>
    <p>GO­ING IN BLIND</p>
    <p>We went in blind dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod. We asked our staff in China to help us source the ma­chines and ship them over to Sin­ga­pore, and con­verted a stor­age fa­cil­ity (for pro­duc­tion).</p>
