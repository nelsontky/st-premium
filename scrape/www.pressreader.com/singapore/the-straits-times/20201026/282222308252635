    <p>It was an­nounced that the nightlife in­dus­try is not ex­pected to re­sume its ac­tiv­i­ties even af­ter Sin­ga­pore en­ters Phase 3 of its re­open­ing (Task force spells out steps to get to phase 3 by year end, Oct 21).</p>
    <p>One par­tic­u­lar business type that seems to have been cat­e­gorised un­der “nightlife” is very dif­fer­ent from the oth­ers, which makes me won­der why it was clas­si­fied as such. I am re­fer­ring to fam­ily karaoke cen­tres, or small-room KTVs.</p>
    <p>As a reg­u­lar pa­tron of such cen­tres with no pro­fes­sional or fi­nan­cial ties to any of them, I find that the rea­sons that make nightlife “high-risk” largely do not ap­ply to them. First, fam­ily KTVs like Teo Heng and Manekineko are not pri­mar­ily night-time busi­nesses or adult venues. Their clien­tele in­cludes youth, and day­time hours form the bulk of their op­er­at­ing hours.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, the phys­i­cal lay­out of fam­ily KTVs is en­tirely dif­fer­ent from KTV lounges and is highly com­pat­i­ble with safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>They do not have large open floors like lounges do; in­stead, they are made up of small rooms. Hop­ping between rooms can be banned and strictly en­forced. If an in­fected per­son vis­its a fam­ily KTV, the walls of the room would con­tain the virus in­side, lim­it­ing ex­po­sure to five or fewer per­sons, and manda­tory dis­in­fec­tion af­ter ev­ery ses­sion would elim­i­nate risks be­fore the next group.</p>
    <p>I feel that lump­ing all busi­nesses un­der this overly-broad nightlife cat­e­gory is un­war­ranted, and a more nu­anced ap­proach should be taken in or­der to save busi­nesses and jobs. I urge the Gov­ern­ment to im­pose as many safe man­age­ment mea­sures as nec­es­sary to en­sure public safety, and al­low fam­ily KTVs – a leisure op­tion beloved by many – to re­open.</p>
