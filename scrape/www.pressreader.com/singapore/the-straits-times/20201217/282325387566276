    <p>Gov­ern­ment-owned Jurong Port is in ad­vanced talks to buy a stake in a petroleum stor­age hub from the fam­ily be­hind col­lapsed oil trader Hin Leong Trad­ing, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple with knowl­edge of the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The deal is for the roughly 40 per cent stake in Uni­ver­sal Ter­mi­nal held by the fam­ily of Lim Oon Kuin, bet­ter known as O.K. Lim, the sources said, ask­ing not to be iden­ti­fied as the mat­ter is pri­vate.</p>
    <p>The sale would still need to win sup­port from Hin Leong’s cred­i­tors, one of the sources said.</p>
    <p>It is un­clear if other bid­ders who were pre­vi­ously ex­plor­ing their own deals are still chal­leng­ing Jurong Port for the stake.</p>
    <p>If the sale goes through, it could help mon­e­tise one of the big­gest as­sets held by the Lim fam­ily, which is grap­pling with the fall­out that has hit Hin Leong amid al­le­ga­tions of fraud.</p>
    <p>The for­mer heavy­weight i n global marine fuel trad­ing owes US$3.5 bil­lion (S$4.7 bil­lion) to more than 20 banks in one of the big­gest com­modi­ties scan­dals in decades, while some cred­i­tors and court-ap­pointed man­agers have taken le­gal ac­tion against the fam­ily to re­cover the money.</p>
    <p>A Lim fam­ily rep­re­sen­ta­tive did not re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Uni­ver­sal Ter­mi­nal com­prises the bulk of the Lims’ busi­ness as­sets, which also in­clude the trad­ing house and a fleet of ves­sels.</p>
    <p>A Jurong Port spokesman also de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>The stor­age hub counts PetroChina and Mac­quarie Asia In­fra­struc­ture Fund as its other share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for PetroChina In­ter­na­tional (Sin­ga­pore) said the com­pany is un­able to com­ment on this is­sue. A Mac­quarie spokesman also de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>Uni­ver­sal Ter­mi­nal started op­er­a­tions on Jurong Is­land in 2008, and its fa­cil­i­ties, which in­clude 78 stor­age tanks and 15 jet­ties, of­fer 2.33 mil­lion cu­bic m of stor­age ca­pac­ity, ac­cord­ing to its web­site.</p>
    <p>Uni­ver­sal Ter­mi­nal was de­vel­oped at a cost of $750 mil­lion, mak­ing it one of the largest in­de­pen­dent petroleum-prod­ucts stor­age fa­cil­i­ties in Asia-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>Jurong Port, which is a wholly owned sub­sidiary of JTC Cor­po­ra­tion, op­er­ates ports and ter­mi­nals han­dling ce­ment, steel, con­tain­ers and fuel in the city-state. The com­pany also has over­seas ven­tures in China and In­done­sia.</p>
