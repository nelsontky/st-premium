    <p>PARIS • France’s Ac­cor, the world’s sixth-largest ho­tel chain, said on Tues­day that it was slash­ing 1,000 jobs world­wide in a ma­jor cost-cut­ting plan ac­cel­er­ated by the ef­fects of the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The group, which runs high-end chains such as Raf­fles and Sof­i­tel and bud­get brands like Ibis, plans to cut costs by €200 mil­lion (S$325 mil­lion) by 2022, Agence FrancePres­se re­ported.</p>
    <p>Ac­cor is the largest ho­tel op­er­a­tor in Sin­ga­pore, cur­rently man­ag­ing 26 ho­tels. Aside from Raf­fles, Sof­i­tel and Ibis, it also man­ages Swis­so­tel, Fair­mont Sin­ga­pore, Novo­tel and Mer­cure.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted, a spokesman from Ac­cor’s Sin­ga­pore of­fice told The Straits Times: “This re­or­gan­i­sa­tion is specif­i­cally targeted at our global cor­po­rate of­fices. As yet, no jobs have been lost in our cor­po­rate of­fice in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has led to the clo­sure of sev­eral Ac­cor ho­tels around the world and 1,000 of the group’s em­ploy­ees will lose their jobs, said fi­nan­cial chief Jean-Jac­ques Morin.</p>
    <p>He said the com­pany em­ploys 18,000 peo­ple at head­quar­ter level.</p>
    <p>Ac­cor, which op­er­ates more than 5,000 ho­tels in 110 coun­tries, could not yet spec­ify where the job cuts would be, Mr Morin added.</p>
    <p>Ac­cor has around 320,000 em­ploy­ees in its net­work world­wide.</p>
    <p>“It is dif­fi­cult to im­ple­ment cost­sav­ing mea­sures in our in­dus­try with­out (these) hav­ing an ef­fect on staff,” Mr Morin said in a tele­phone in­ter­view. “We will help them,” he said, re­fer­ring to those to be laid off.</p>
    <p>Travel in­dus­try news web­site Skift cited Ac­cor chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Se­bastien Bazin say­ing that if any of its work­ers with salaries be­low €50,000 were af­fected by the cuts, they would still be paid and kept on the Ac­cor pay­roll for at least two years, where they could also un­dergo train­ing.</p>
    <p>“No way are we leav­ing un­der­priv­i­leged peo­ple on the streets of the world to­day,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ac­cor posted half-year net losses of €1.5 bil­lion against a profit of</p>

    <p>This re­or­gan­i­sa­tion is specif­i­cally targeted at our global cor­po­rate of­fices. As yet, no jobs have been lost in our cor­po­rate of­fice in ’’ Sin­ga­pore.</p>

    <p>€141 mil­lion dur­ing the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Turnover plunged to €917 mil­lion. This is down 52.4 per cent com­pared with the first half of last year, Skift re­ported.</p>
    <p>“The bad half-year re­sults re­flect the ex­tra­or­di­nary en­vi­ron­ment linked to the coron­avirus cri­sis,” Mr Morin said.</p>
    <p>Mr Bazin said: “The shock that our in­dus­try is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing is both vi­o­lent and un­prece­dented. The peak of the cri­sis is un­doubt­edly be­hind us, but the re­cov­ery will be grad­ual.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing taken these emer­gency steps, we must now fin­ish the job from an as­set-light model to a full as­set-light com­pany.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cor, in an up­date on its web­site, said 81 per cent of its ho­tels have re­opened their doors and busi­ness is grad­u­ally ramp­ing up again. “We never ac­tu­ally stopped grow­ing ei­ther, as we con­tin­ued to bring on new ho­tels over re­cent months, adding 12,000 new rooms to our port­fo­lio, bring­ing it up to 5,100 ho­tels and 748,000 rooms,” it said.</p>
    <p>“Our ho­tels are now ready to wel­come a dif­fer­ent kind of clien­tele that is seek­ing leisure ac­tiv­i­ties, do­mes­tic tourism and a lower level of busi­ness travel,” it added, stress­ing strict hy­giene and preven­tion mea­sures in place to en­sure safety.</p>
    <p>In a video up­date, Mr Bazin said the com­pany’s best strength was its hu­man cap­i­tal – the 320,000 peo­ple work­ing for Ac­cor.</p>
    <p>“They are not only good, but they are car­ing, they have the ex­per­tise, and they have the ro­bust­ness to ac­cept the cri­sis,” he added.</p>
