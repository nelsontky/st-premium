    <p>More in­fec­tions could emerge from the fam­ily of 13 who had din­ner to­gether at a Tampines restau­rant after one of them fell ill two days later and tested pos­i­tive for</p>
    <p>Covid-19. But a ma­jor flare-up is un­likely, given con­tact trac­ing and other mea­sures, say ex­perts.</p>
    <p>More in­fec­tions could emerge after a 32-year-old man who had din­ner with 12 fam­ily mem­bers tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, but with con­tact trac­ing and other mea­sures, there is a good chance this will not lead to a ma­jor clus­ter, ex­perts said.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day night, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) re­ported Sin­ga­pore’s first com­mu­nity case i n more than two weeks – a Sin­ga­porean ma­rine ser­vice en­gi­neer who tested pos­i­tive four days after a fam­ily din­ner last Satur­day at Seoul Gar­den in Tampines Mall. He went to see a doc­tor after com­ing down with a fever and sore throat.</p>
    <p>The group oc­cu­pied three ta­bles and there was min­gling, de­spite rules that state no more than five din­ers per group.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher, se­nior con­sul­tant at the di­vi­sion of in­fec­tious dis­eases at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hospi­tal, told The Straits Times: “It is quite pos­si­ble that he may have passed it on and there will be a sec­ond gen­er­a­tion of cases – a small clus­ter. But pro­vided those con­tacts are quar­an­tined when di­ag­nosed, then the trans­mis­sion chain will stop there.</p>
    <p>“It is a credit to Sin­ga­pore’s en­hanced surveil­lance that it was picked up. This gives us the best chance to stop fur­ther spread early.”</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, said: “I am not par­tic­u­larly con­cerned that this sin­gle case will sud­denly re­sult in a large out­break within the com­mu­nity since con­tact trac­ing will iden­tify any­one that has been ex­posed and these peo­ple will be quar­an­tined and tested.”</p>
    <p>Even if the man goes on to in­fect oth­ers in his net­works, the present pro­to­cols around con­tact trac­ing will be able to halt the trans­mis­sion chain, he noted.</p>
    <p>Prof Teo said: “Re­mem­ber that we have had com­mu­nity cases since Fe­bru­ary, and the pro­to­cols have worked well to han­dle any emerg­ing clus­ters.”</p>
    <p>Still, the in­ci­dent is a stark re­minder that safe distancing and other mea­sures must be taken se­ri­ously, the ex­perts stressed.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Alex Cook, vice-dean of re­search at the same school, said: “If the five-per­son rule had been ad­hered to, then rather than 12 fam­ily mem­bers po­ten­tially at risk, only four would be.”</p>
    <p>Prof Teo said: “Hav­ing a stretch of zero com­mu­nity cases does not mean that we can let down our guard. The re­al­ity is that the pub­lic health mea­sures that have been im­posed are meant to serve two pur­poses. First, to pre­vent out­breaks in the com­mu­nity, and sec­ond, should there be an out­break, the spread is slowed down suf­fi­ciently to al­low con­tact trac­ing, test­ing and quar­an­tin­ing to come in to break any chains of trans­mis­sions in the com­mu­nity.”</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Gavin J. Smith, in­terim direc­tor of the emerg­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases pro­gramme at the Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School, said: “The virus has not been erad­i­cated and we need to be pre­pared for oc­ca­sional cases. Peo­ple stick­ing to the con­trol mea­sures makes the job of pre­vent­ing fur­ther spread a lot eas­ier.”</p>
