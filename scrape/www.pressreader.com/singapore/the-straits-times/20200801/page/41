Are just the ones God calls away And takes them home to rest. They say that time heals all sorrows And helps us to forget.
But time so far has only shown We miss you more and more.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                     You were someone we could talk to That no one can replace.
You were someone we could turn to When we needed a helping hand. You were someone we could count on To advise and understand.           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Thoughtful, loving, caring, wise and kind An understand­ing heart, an intelligen­t mind So pleasant a voice, so sweet a smile,
You had a pleasant way. Honorable and just in all your ways No guile, no malice, so non-complainin­g You spoke no ill of anyone.

You asked for nothing from any of us. Of the many blessings however great or small To have had you for a brother
Was the greatest gift of all.
