    <p>For law firm Lee Shergill – one of four to achieve a five-star rat­ing for neg­li­gence law in the Best Law Firms 2021 rank­ings – han­dling the case of a vis­ually hand­i­capped man was both rare and in­spir­ing.</p>
    <p>Man­ag­ing part­ner Raj Singh Shergill said he was struck by the pos­i­tive out­look of Mr Zamry Ab­dul Karim, who has been blind since birth.</p>
    <p>In court doc­u­ments filed, Mr Zamry re­lated how, when us­ing his white cane to cross Toh Guan Road at a sig­nalised T-junc­tion with Toh Guan View in Jurong East at about 11.30pm on June 13, 2017, he was knocked down by a taxi.</p>
    <p>He frac­tured his leg and had other in­juries, re­ceived hospi­tal treat­ment, and has re­mained job­less since then be­cause of his dis­abil­i­ties as a re­sult of the in­juries from the ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Be­fore that, he had worked for 15 years as a mas­sage ther­a­pist.</p>
    <p>Mr Zamry, 51, will re­ceive 50 per cent of dam­ages claimed after an agree­ment was worked out with the ve­hi­cle in­surer through its lawyer K. An­parasan last month, avert­ing a High Court trial.</p>
    <p>The quan­tum payable to Mr Zamry will be court-as­sessed separately.</p>
    <p>Mr Zamry had mem­o­rised the route be­tween his work­place and Toh Guan Road, where he lived then. He had trav­elled the same route with­out in­ci­dent since 1999.</p>
    <p>At most pedes­trian cross­ings, he would press the but­ton for the vis­ually im­paired and the el­derly to en­sure he had more time to cross the road, with the audi­ble beep from the traf­fic sig­nals al­low­ing him to gauge how much time he had to com­plete the cross­ing.</p>
    <p>But the cross­ing at the Toh Guan Road and Toh Guan View junc­tion did not have this but­ton func­tion. So he had to lis­ten care­fully to the sound of the traf­fic around him.</p>
    <p>“As a blind per­son, we be­come re­liant on our sense of hear­ing, which in turn be­comes more finely at­tuned to our sur­round­ings. When the cars stopped and I could hear their en­gines idling, I would use this as a gauge to be­gin cross­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Zamry said he was grate­ful to Mr Shergill for his ef­forts.</p>
    <p>“I live like Bat­man at home be</p>
    <p>cause I have lived in the dark since I was born and I don’t miss the light. I switch on the light only when I get vis­i­tors to my flat. I have mem­o­rised my flat lay­out and so I don’t have to use the white cane at home,” he said on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Shergill said the case was one in a wide range of neg­li­gence suits the firm had han­dled that drew no­tice from clients and peers alike.</p>
    <p>“The rank­ing is a ring­ing en­dorse­ment by clients and fel­low lawyers of our team’s ef­forts. It is en­cour­ag­ing and in­spir­ing to know that we are ap­pre­ci­ated and that we have made a dif­fer­ence in our call­ing to se­cure jus­tice for in­jury or med­i­cal neg­li­gence vic­tims.</p>
    <p>“More so when we are up against in­dus­try giants with deeper re­sources. I hope the recog­ni­tion re­ceived will in­spire more young lawyers to ded­i­cate their le­gal minds to ar­eas where they can be a bless­ing to oth­ers in their time of need,” said Mr Shergill.</p>
