    <p>WASH­ING­TON/BEI­JING • Top US and Chi­nese trade of­fi­cials have reaf­firmed their com­mit­ment to their phase one trade deal, which has seen China lag­ging on its obli­ga­tions to buy Amer­i­can goods, giv­ing a boost to fi­nan­cial mar­kets yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The pledge was made in a tele­phone call between US Trade Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Robert Lighthizer, US Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Steven Mnuchin and Chi­nese Vice-Premier Liu He – their first for­mal di­a­logue since early May – amid con­cern the deal could be on shaky ground be­cause of wors­en­ing United States-China ties.</p>
    <p>“Both sides see progress and are com­mit­ted to tak­ing the steps nec­es­sary to en­sure the suc­cess of the agree­ment,” the of­fice of the US Trade Rep­re­sen­ta­tive (USTR) said in a state­ment af­ter what it de­scribed as a reg­u­larly sched­uled call.</p>
    <p>The call was orig­i­nally ex­pected on Aug 15, six months af­ter the trade deal was launched.</p>
    <p>But Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, who has fre­quently ex­pressed anger at China over the han­dling of the coronaviru­s pan­demic, said last week he had post­poned talks with China be­cause “I don’t want to deal with them now”.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton and Bei­jing have traded sanc­tions and barbs over a grow­ing list of issues, in­clud­ing China’s new na­tional se­cu­rity law im­posed on Hong Kong, and US ac­cu­sa­tions of na­tional se­cu­rity threats posed by Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>China’s com­merce min­istry con­firmed that the two sides had a con­struc­tive di­a­logue and agreed to con­tinue push­ing for­ward the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the phase one trade deal.</p>
    <p>The USTR said they “ad­dressed steps that China has taken to ef­fec­tu­ate struc­tural changes” on issues that in­clude pro­tect­ing in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty rights, re­mov­ing im­ped­i­ments for US com­pa­nies in the fi­nan­cial ser­vices and agri­cul­ture sec­tors, and elim­i­nat­ing forced tech­nol­ogy trans­fers.</p>
    <p>“The par­ties also dis­cussed the sig­nif­i­cant in­creases in pur­chases of US prod­ucts by China as well as fu­ture ac­tions needed to im­ple­ment the agree­ment,” it said.</p>
    <p>News of the call helped lift global stocks and Asian cur­ren­cies.</p>
    <p>“US-China talks are bullish for most com­modi­ties as Mr Trump is des­per­ate for good news to help in the elec­tion,” said Mr Ole Houe, di­rec­tor of ad­vi­sory ser­vices at agri­cul­ture bro­ker­age Ikon Com­modi­ties in Syd­ney. “It could lead to higher de­mand for US prod­ucts.”</p>
    <p>Chi­nese pur­chases of US goods are run­ning well be­hind the pace needed to meet a first-year in­crease of US$77 bil­lion (S$105 bil­lion) spec­i­fied in the deal, ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cial data.</p>
    <p>While China has re­cently ramped up buy­ing of farm goods, in­clud­ing soya beans, it is far from meet­ing its com­mit­ment to buy US$36.5 bil­lion worth of US agri­cul­tural goods un­der the deal – pur­chases that Mr Trump has counted on to bol­ster his sup­port in farm states that backed him in the 2016 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The United States ex­ported just US$7.27 bil­lion in agri­cul­tural goods to China in the first half of the year, ac­cord­ing to the US Cen­sus Bureau.</p>
    <p>The US com­ments “showed that they think we are go­ing to keep buy­ing from the US, at least be­fore the elec­tion takes place. And we will”, an agri­cul­tural goods trader with a Chi­nese state-owned com­pany told Reuters, de­clin­ing to be iden­ti­fied as he is not au­tho­rised to speak to the me­dia.</p>
    <p>“We are def­i­nitely go­ing to main­tain the stance to buy as much as pos­si­ble, but it is re­ally hard to say whether the tar­gets can be reached.”</p>
    <p>Mr Sushant Gupta, re­search di­rec­tor at Wood Mackenzie con­sul­tancy, ex­pects China to import more Amer­i­can liq­ue­fied petroleum gas, propane and eth­ane in the sec­ond half of this year to meet petro­chem­i­cal feed­stock short­ages, but does not ex­pect it to be able to in­crease US crude im­ports enough to meet the phase one tar­gets.</p>
    <p>While China has re­cently ramped up buy­ing of farm goods... it is far from meet­ing its com­mit­ment to buy US$36.5 bil­lion (S$50 bil­lion) worth of US agri­cul­tural goods un­der the deal – pur­chases that Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has counted on to bol­ster his sup­port in farm states that backed him in the 2016 elec­tion.</p>
