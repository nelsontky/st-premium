    <p>ESSENCE OF SCO</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Orches­tra Sin­ga­pore Con­fer­ence Hall Last Fri­day, Sept 11</p>
    <p>Sept 11 is re­mem­bered for the 2001 ter­ror­ist at­tacks i n the United States, but in Sin­ga­pore this year, it marked the re­turn of con­cert life after six months in the wilder­ness.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic is still with us, but traces of the old nor­mal­ity are re­turn­ing, as the Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Orches­tra (SCO) be­came the first mu­si­cal group to present a live con­cert be­fore a live au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>Greeted by warm and ap­pre­cia­tive ap­plause, a pared-down 23per­son cham­ber orches­tra, led by mu­sic di­rec­tor Yeh Tsung, per­formed an hour-long con­cert for a so­cially dis­tanced au­di­ence lim­ited to just 50 peo­ple. The first thought that came to mind: What a plea­sure it was to wit­ness mu­sic first­hand rather than on a screen and through a pair of head­phones.</p>
    <p>Zhao Jip­ing’s rous­ing Cel­e­bra­tion Over­ture opened the con­cert. Though its first pages were a bla­tant rip-off of Glinka’s Rus­lan And Lud­milla Over­ture, there was still enough orig­i­nal ma­te­rial to sus­tain in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>The big erhu melody, later heard on con­cert­mas­ter Li Baoshun’s jinghu, was mem­o­rable, as was Jin Shiyi’s suona solo, which rose above the throng at its apoth­e­o­sis.</p>
    <p>Con­duc­tor Yeh com­pared the evening’s pro­gramme with a four­move­ment sym­phony. Thus, the ren­di­tion of Re­flec­tion Of The</p>
    <p>Moon On Erquan by legendary blind erhu player Hua Yan­jun – also known as Abing – served as the slow sec­ond move­ment.</p>
    <p>Or­ches­trated for bowed strings by Wu Zhuqiang and Moses Gay, the en­sem­ble played like an ex­panded string quar­tet, with melodic in­ter­est sus­tained by gao­hus and er­hus.</p>
    <p>Some have com­pared this with Bar­ber’s Ada­gio For Strings, but these works are ac­tu­ally very dif­fer­ent. Abing’s Moon is at­mo­spheric and med­i­ta­tive but not weepy, evok­ing nos­tal­gia rather than tragedy or out­right grief. The over­all ef­fect was par­tic­u­larly beau­ti­ful.</p>
    <p>Still on pop­u­lar melodies, Moli­hua (Jas­mine) was re­lived in a form of a sym­phonic fan­tasy by mas­ter or­ches­tra­tor Liu Wen­jin.</p>
    <p>The highly recog­nis­able tune was heard at the out­set and sub­ject to a fine se­ries of vari­a­tions. Among the solo in­stru­ments high­lighted were the dizi and Jin’s suona, which be­came its most prom­i­nent voice.</p>
    <p>The con­cert’s fi­nal move­ment was an abridged 10-minute ver­sion of Law Wai Lun’s The Ce­les­tial Web, a large-scale work com­mis­sioned by the Sin­ga­pore Arts Fes­ti­val and pre­miered by the SCO in 2003.</p>
    <p>Gone, how­ever, were the recita­tions, cho­rus and Tan Swie Hian’s words which hailed the uni­ver­sal­ity of man, but Schiller’s Ode To Joy mes­sage came through in the mu­sic, which opened with de­lib­er­ate quotes from Beethoven’s Ninth Sym­phony.</p>
    <p>Eclec­tic as this mu­sic was, with in­flu­ences from Ravel, Gersh­win and film mu­sic, it did not out­stay its wel­come. The op­por­tu­nity to en­joy its in­tri­cate in­stru­men­ta­tion, Zhao Jian­hua’s erhu solo and a sen­ti­men­tal wal­low to­wards the end was well worth the time.</p>
    <p>The gen­eral feel­ing of op­ti­mism con­tin­ued into the cel­e­bra­tory en­core Hua Hao Yue Yuan (Bloom­ing Flow­ers, Full Moon) with a cus­tom­ary clap-along.</p>
    <p>What was there not to en­joy?</p>
