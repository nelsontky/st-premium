    <p>The Na­tional Li­brary Board (NLB) has moved a book meant for chil­dren to the adult sec­tion, un­der fam­ily and par­ent­ing, af­ter a com­plaint that it has racist mes­sages.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on Mon­day, NLB said that it came to the de­ci­sion on the Chi­nese-lan­guage book – ti­tled Who Wins? – fol­low­ing a re­view done in con­sul­ta­tion with the Li­brary Con­sul­ta­tive Panel.</p>
    <p>“Par­ents and guardians can make use of this book to dis­cuss how chil­dren can deal with bul­ly­ing in schools and cor­rect any po­ten­tial mis­un­der­stand­ings that chil­dren may have,” the board said.</p>
    <p>The Li­brary Con­sul­ta­tive Panel is an in­de­pen­dent cit­i­zen-based com­mit­tee com­pris­ing mem­bers from a cross-sec­tion of so­ci­ety. It pro­vides rec­om­men­da­tions to NLB on its re­view of books that mem­bers of the pub­lic have raised con­cerns about.</p>
    <p>Writ­ten by Wu Xing Hua, Who Wins? has been off the shelves since July 19, when NLB de­cided to re­move the book for re­view.</p>
    <p>It is a pic­ture book aimed at chil­dren aged seven to nine that fea­tures a “dark-skinned” boy with “oily curly hair” named Mao Mao – Chi­nese for hairy – who is an ag­gres­sive school bully.</p>
    <p>It was pub­lished in Sin­ga­pore by</p>
    <p>Mar­shall Cavendish Ed­u­ca­tion as part of a se­ries of five books ti­tled Amaz­ing Ad­ven­tures Of Pi Pi.</p>
    <p>Li­brary user Estella Young, 42, had writ­ten a post about it on her Face­book page in July un­der the so­cial me­dia name Umm Yu­sof.</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing the book as “as­tound­ingly racist”, she noted in the post that the vil­lain was be­ing writ­ten about in “ex­plic­itly racialised terms, and in con­trast to all the other char­ac­ters who are de­picted as fair-skinned”.</p>
    <p>She added: “What on earth pos­sessed Mar­shall Cavendish Ed­u­ca­tion to pub­lish a book in which the sole dark-skinned char­ac­ter is ir­re­deemably nasty – es­pe­cially when his ap­pear­ance is ir­rel­e­vant to the plot?”</p>
    <p>Mar­shall Cavendish Ed­u­ca­tion apol­o­gised to read­ers through a state­ment on Face­book on July 21, adding that it would cease the sale and dis­tri­bu­tion of the rest of the se­ries as well as re­call avail­able copies from retail stores.</p>
    <p>In its apol­ogy, the pub­lisher said it had no in­ten­tion of pro­duc­ing con­tent pro­mot­ing dis­crim­i­na­tion in any way.</p>
    <p>“The books we pub­lish cater to an all-in­clu­sive so­ci­ety where di­ver­sity is re­spected and cel­e­brated, and our team is ded­i­cated and com­mit­ted to that cause,” it added.</p>
