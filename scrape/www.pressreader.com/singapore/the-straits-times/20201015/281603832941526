    <p>•</p>
    <p>KUALA LUMPUR Malaysia yes­ter­day logged 660 new coro­n­avirus cases, the same num­ber for the sec­ond day, as the gov­ern­ment reim­posed tighter move­ment curbs on 7.6 mil­lion peo­ple in Kuala Lumpur and the neigh­bour­ing state of Se­lan­gor for the next two weeks.</p>
    <p>They joined an­other 3.5 mil­lion res­i­dents of Sabah state which saw the reim­po­si­tion of the con­di­tional move­ment con­trol or­der (CMCO) on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The tighter re­stric­tions were reim­posed as new daily cases of Covid-19, that had trended down in the last few months to two dig­its, started to rise again from late last month.</p>
    <p>Malaysia has seen over 300 cases a day in the last 10 days, from Mon­day last week.</p>
    <p>New daily cases hit a record high of 691 last Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The so-called third wave i n Malaysia started in Sabah with an out­break of the dis­ease at de­ten­tion cen­tres for il­le­gal mi­grants, and spread quickly fol­low­ing a twoweek election cam­paign that pre­ceded the Sept 26 state polls.</p>
    <p>The stricter CMCO in the Klang Val­ley – as the fed­eral ter­ri­to­ries of Kuala Lumpur and Pu­tra­jaya, and Se­lan­gor state are called – re­placed the more re­laxed re­cov­ery MCO that started on June 10.</p>
    <p>Un­der the re­cov­ery MCO, mass wed­dings and mass wor­ship were al­lowed, while malls and restau­rants op­er­ated as usual, as long as they adopted safety pro­ce­dures such as check­ing the tem­per­a­tures of work­ers and vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>Mass gath­er­ings are now banned for the next two weeks.</p>
    <p>Malls and restau­rants, which had started to fill up again in the last four months, re­mained open but many were empty yes­ter­day, as cus­tomers stayed away.</p>
    <p>Po­lice yes­ter­day started to mount road­blocks again all over the Klang Val­ley to dis­cour­age peo­ple from leav­ing their homes.</p>
    <p>Driv­ers could be stuck for hours in traf­fic jams as the po­lice stopped ve­hi­cles to ask the oc­cu­pants where they were go­ing.</p>
    <p>For those cross­ing state bor­ders to work, they need to show let­ters from their em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>Deputy In­spec­tor-Gen­eral of Po­lice Acryl Sani Ab­dul­lah Sani said: “We are fo­cus­ing on the bor­ders of dis­tricts and states i n Kuala Lumpur, Pu­tra­jaya and Se­lan­gor. We have started since mid­night on Wed­nes­day.”</p>
    <p>He added: “The gov­ern­ment’s aim at lim­it­ing the move­ment of peo­ple has been achieved.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, we are still mon­i­tor­ing the sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment, wor­ried that shut­ting down com­mer­cial ac­tiv­i­ties could kill the al­ready weak­ened econ­omy, is al­low­ing most busi­nesses to con­tinue to op­er­ate.</p>
    <p>Senior Min­is­ter Is­mail Sabri Yaakob gave his as­sur­ance that ac­tiv­i­ties in the eco­nomic, busi­ness and in­dus­trial sec­tors are able to con­tinue as usual de­spite the curbs.</p>
    <p>“In­di­vid­u­als who are in the high­risk cat­e­gory, as well as chil­dren, are en­cour­aged not to be in public, open and crowded places dur­ing this pe­riod,” he said.</p>
    <p>While food out­lets are en­cour­aged to pro­vide take­aways, de­liv­er­ies and drive-through ser­vices, dine-in is still al­lowed but lim­ited to two peo­ple per ta­ble.</p>
    <p>Clin­ics and hos­pi­tals can still pro­vide 24-hour ser­vice, while op­er­at­ing hours for phar­ma­cies are be­tween 8am and 11pm.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, many op­er­a­tors of eater­ies are con­cerned about a slide in busi­ness again, first seen when Malaysia im­posed the strict MCO in mid-March and eased the re­stric­tions only in June.</p>
    <p>Subang Jaya Cof­fee Shops and Restau­rants As­so­ci­a­tion chair­man Johnny Liu said this is go­ing to be a tough pe­riod for the more than 3,000 cof­fee shop and res­tau­rant own­ers in the Subang Jaya and Seri Kem­ban­gan ar­eas in Se­lan­gor.</p>
    <p>“We had just started to re­cover since the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the MCO in March.</p>
    <p>For Sabah, it is stricter be­cause al­most half of the state is in the red zone... while for Se­lan­gor, Kuala Lumpur and Pu­tra­jaya, this is a proac­tive move by the gov­ern­ment to pre­vent fur­ther in­fec­tions. We are see­ing an up­ward trend in cases and we are con­cerned whether it would in­fect other dis­tricts or ar­eas.</p>
    <p>SENIOR MIN­IS­TER IS­MAIL SABRI YAAKOB</p>
    <p>“Our mem­bers are also re­quest­ing for help to cover their rental and util­i­ties bills,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Chua Beng Chun, who owns a cafe in Klang on the Malaysian west coast, said he and his staff had rushed to pre­pare new take­away and de­liv­ery menus.</p>
    <p>“I think it is ex­tra tough on cafe own­ers be­cause most cus­tomers who dine in do so for the am­bi­ence and en­vi­ron­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Is­mail Sabri said that although the CMCO is strict in the Klang Val­ley, stricter mea­sures are be­ing im­posed in Sabah, where the bulk of daily cases are recorded.</p>
    <p>“For Sabah, it is stricter be­cause</p>
    <p>al­most half of the state is in the red zone (show­ing a spike in cases), while for Se­lan­gor, Kuala Lumpur and Pu­tra­jaya, this is a proac­tive move by the gov­ern­ment to pre­vent fur­ther in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>“We are see­ing an up­ward trend in cases and we are con­cerned whether it would in­fect other dis­tricts or ar­eas, and that’s why we have the con­di­tional MCO in place,” he said.</p>
    <p>The num­bers showed that most cases in re­cent weeks were from Sabah.</p>
    <p>Of the 660 cases logged yes­ter­day, 429 in­fec­tions – or 65 per cent – were from Sabah.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry’s di­rec­tor­gen­eral Noor Hisham Ab­dul­lah said: “This is due to the in­creased Covid-19 screen­ing ac­tiv­i­ties which are be­ing car­ried out in the state, and with more sam­ples pro­duc­ing re­sults.”</p>
    <p>Kedah state had 113 cases, with the re­cent jump in cases from a big out­break in Alor Se­tar Prison, fol­lowed by the spread of in­fec­tions in two other state pris­ons.</p>
    <p>Klang Val­ley yes­ter­day recorded 11.5 per cent of the 660 cases.</p>
    <p>Se­lan­gor had 68 cases, Kuala Lumpur had seven cases and Pu­tra­jaya had one case.</p>
