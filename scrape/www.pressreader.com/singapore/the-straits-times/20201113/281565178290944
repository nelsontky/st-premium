    <p>Chil­dren with hear­ing loss will re­ceive ded­i­cated sup­port for the first time at a pre-school run by the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE). The kinder­garten will teach sign lan­guage to chil­dren with mod­er­ate to pro­found hear­ing loss. The aim is for them to build ba­sic lan­guage pro­fi­ciency in Sin­ga­pore sign lan­guage from a young age.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren with hear­ing loss will get ded­i­cated sup­port for the first time at a pre-school run by the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE).</p>
    <p>The kinder­garten, which starts op­er­a­tions next year, will teach sign lan­guage to chil­dren with mod­er­ate to pro­found hear­ing loss.</p>
    <p>The aim is for them to build ba­sic lan­guage pro­fi­ciency in the Sin­ga­pore Sign Lan­guage from a young age, so that they can learn the same cur­ricu­lum as their hear­ing peers.</p>
    <p>Be­sides hav­ing a ded­i­cated sign lan­guage teacher, chil­dren will have ac­cess to ex­ter­nal speech and lan­guage ther­a­pists as well as ser­vices pro­vided by au­di­ol­o­gists in school.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre, which will be lo­cated within Mayflower Pri­mary School in Ang Mo Kio, will have a ca­pac­ity of 120 chil­dren per co­hort.</p>
    <p>It will take in seven to 10 chil­dren with hear­ing loss per level from 2022.</p>
    <p>There are no plans to ex­pand the spe­cialised sup­port to other MOE kinder­gartens, as the num­ber of chil­dren with hear­ing loss in each co­hort is not large.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter of State for Ed­u­ca­tion Sun Xuel­ing, who an­nounced this pro­vi­sion yes­ter­day dur­ing a visit to Mayflower Pri­mary School, said: “We be­lieve that the ear­lier the chil­dren with hear­ing loss come into con­tact with the Sin­ga­pore Sign Lan­guage, the bet­ter their foun­da­tions in it.</p>
    <p>“It will help to build their con­fi­dence and will also al­low them to in­ter­act bet­ter with their peers.”</p>
    <p>She added: “Such a model al­lows greater in­clu­sion in our ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem. It al­lows our typ­i­cally de­vel­op­ing chil­dren to see and in­ter­act with chil­dren of dif­fer­ent abil­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>She said chil­dren with hear­ing loss will ben­e­fit from hav­ing reg­u­lar in­ter­ac­tion with their peers as it can boost their con­fi­dence and help them so­cialise bet­ter.</p>
    <p>The other chil­dren will also be able to pick up sign lan­guage.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, pre-school chil­dren with hear­ing loss re­ceive sup­port from ex­ter­nal providers like hos­pi­tals and cen­tres which run early in­ter­ven­tion pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>Mayflower Pri­mary School is the first pri­mary school to take in chil­dren with mod­er­ate to pro­found hear­ing loss who use sign lan­guage. It started with six such chil­dren in 2018 and now has nine across the dif­fer­ent levels.</p>
    <p>MOE said that its kinder­gartens al­ready pro­vide sup­port to chil­dren with mild de­vel­op­men­tal de­lays, who can learn in a group of 20 chil­dren.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said that it will con­tinue to meet the needs of chil­dren who re­quire ex­tra sup­port and help them have a smooth tran­si­tion to the next phase of ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>About four in 1,000 ba­bies in Sin­ga­pore are born with hear­ing loss each year. About one in 1,000 will have se­vere hear­ing loss.</p>
    <p>In­for­ma­tion on the ad­mis­sion process for chil­dren with hear­ing loss to the MOE kinder­garten in Mayflower Pri­mary will be re­leased in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lim-Chua Siow Ling, prin­ci­pal of Mayflower Pri­mary, said that chil­dren with hear­ing loss com­ing into the school may have vary­ing levels of ex­po­sure to the Sin­ga­pore Sign Lan­guage.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing the spe­cialised sup­port in the pre-school will help ease the tran­si­tion for these chil­dren to pri­mary school, as early ex­po­sure to the lan­guage is im­por­tant for their learn­ing and so­cial skills, she added.</p>
