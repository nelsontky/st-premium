    <p>Be­sides Sin­ga­pore, many other places in the world have also turned to elec­tronic mon­i­tor­ing de­vices to help them con­trol the spread of the coro­n­avirus. Here are some places that do so:</p>
    <p>HONG KONG</p>
    <p>In March, Hong Kong be­gan or­der­ing all ar­rivals from over­seas to wear elec­tronic bracelets dur­ing home quar­an­tine. The no-frills band con­nects to an app which sends out alerts for the wear­ers to take pic­tures of them­selves with the wrist­band, and is­sues warn­ings if it senses a per­son has left his or her res­i­dence. The de­vice de­tects and analy­ses ra­dio sig­nals, in­clud­ing Blue­tooth, WiFi and ge­o­graph­i­cal lo­ca­tion sig­nals such as GPS.</p>
    <p>Po­lice and health of­fi­cials track down those not in com­pli­ance and vi­o­la­tors risk six months in jail.</p>
    <p>SOUTH KOREA</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has rolled out elec­tronic wrist­bands for those who defy a manda­tory quar­an­tine or­der, af­ter many left their homes with­out tak­ing their smart­phones in­stalled with track­ing apps.</p>
    <p>The wrist­band con­nects to the gov­ern­ment’s mo­bile app that mon­i­tors the move­ment of a per­son un­der quar­an­tine. A no­ti­fi­ca­tion will be sent to the au­thor­i­ties if the de­vice is dam­aged.</p>
    <p>The wrist­band also checks for fever and other health con­di­tions via a sen­sor twice a day. It will also ask the per­son to con­firm his or her lo­ca­tion if it is not used for a cer­tain pe­riod of time. The po­lice will visit the home if there is no re­sponse.</p>
    <p>SARAWAK, MALAYSIA</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties in Sarawak re­quire ev­ery­one en­ter­ing the eastern state to strap on a QR-coded wrist­band. Upon scan­ning the QR code, the wear­ers will have to en­ter a set of in­for­ma­tion into a web­site.</p>
    <p>They will have to re­port their lo­ca­tions at 8am and 8pm daily. This al­lows the health au­thor­i­ties to mon­i­tor their where­abouts dur­ing the 14-day quar­an­tine pe­riod and per­form “ran­dom checks” on them based on the in­for­ma­tion sent from the de­vice.</p>
    <p>JOR­DAN</p>
    <p>The king­dom on July 4 be­gan re­quir­ing trav­ellers to wear elec­tronic bracelets dur­ing home quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>The bracelet con­nects to a per­son’s smart­phone via Blue­tooth with GPS en­abled to track move­ment, ac­cord­ing to a re­port by Roya News. Once the per­son ar­rives home to serve quar­an­tine, the house lo­ca­tion is recorded.</p>
    <p>BAHRAIN</p>
    <p>Those un­der com­pul­sory home quar­an­tines will be given a wrist­band which is con­nected to the gov­ern­ment’s “BeAware” con­tact trac­ing app that will track their move­ments.</p>
    <p>Health Min­istry of­fi­cials may ran­domly send re­quests to in­di­vid­u­als un­der quar­an­tine ask­ing for photos that clearly show their face and bracelet. An alert is also sent to a mon­i­tor­ing sta­tion if the wearer moves far­ther than 15m away from their phone.</p>
    <p>Any at­tempt to re­move or tam­per with the bracelet will re­sult in the per­son be­ing po­ten­tially fined be­tween 1,000 and 10,000 Bahraini di­nar (S$36,430) or jailed for no less than three months.</p>
    <p>KUWAIT</p>
    <p>Kuwait na­tion­als re­turn­ing from abroad are given a smart bracelet linked to the “Shlonik” con­tact trac­ing app, for use dur­ing home quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>The bracelet sends move­ment data to the au­thor­i­ties and will no­tify the Health Min­istry if peo­ple break quar­an­tine rules, China’s Xin­hua news agency quoted Ms Mona Al-Khabaz, head of the min­istry’s team in charge of dig­i­tal mon­i­tor­ing of peo­ple un­der home quar­an­tine, as say­ing.</p>
    <p>The bracelet sends ques­tions to the wear­ers twice a day on whether they have symp­toms of Covid-19, and also asks users to sub­mit ran­dom self­ies.</p>
    <p>Vi­o­la­tors risk be­ing trans­ferred to a gov­ern­ment quar­an­tine fa­cil­ity, as well as face other le­gal ac­tions.</p>
    <p>LIECHT­EN­STEIN</p>
    <p>One in 10 res­i­dents were given bio­met­ric bracelets as part of a study to track po­ten­tial Covid-19 cases in real time. The bracelets will send tem­per­a­ture, breath­ing and heart rate data to a lab in Switzer­land for anal­y­sis. The Fi­nan­cial Times re­ported that by au­tumn, the bracelets will be of­fered to the whole pop­u­la­tion of 38,000.</p>
