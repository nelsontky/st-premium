    <p>EL­LIE FUN BOX</p>
    <p>For­mer sec­ondary school teach­ers Abi­gail Chee and Matilda Huang, both 37, both be­came moth­ers in 2011. Ms Chee holds a Diploma in Montes­sori and wanted to spread the word about the Montes­sori learning ap­proach, which in­spired their foray into busi­ness four years ago. Their cu­rated boxes of Montes­sori-in­spired learning ma­te­ri­als are se­quen­tial – each one build­ing upon the pre­vi­ous ac­tiv­i­ties – and in English and Chi­nese to en­cour­age bilin­gual­ism. Each box con­tains a Chi­nese book and about eight to 10 ac­tiv­i­ties cov­er­ing phon­ics, Chi­nese, maths, sci­ence and art and craft. Suit­able for kids aged 21/ to six.</p>

    <p>Prices: Buy in­di­vid­ual boxes at $53, ship­ping in­cluded. Sub­scrip­tions are avail­able about three times a year. Info: el­liefun­box.com</p>
    <p>JOSH & CHERIE BOOKS</p>
    <p>Mar­ried cou­ple Julius Chen, 30, and Ch­eryl Ang, 29, launched this chil­dren’s book subscripti­on ser­vice in 2016 when they could not find good books for their nephew. It cu­rates ti­tles that are not usu­ally found in gen­eral book­stores and tar­gets chil­dren from new­borns up to age seven, with dif­fer­ent themes and early learning ob­jec­tives. Each box for new­borns and ba­bies up to age two con­tains three board books, while a box for kids aged three to seven has two pic­ture books. There are four age cat­e­gories. Prices: From $31.90 to $33.90 a box, de­pend­ing on the length of subscripti­on. Add $10 for a Chi­nese book. There are Sib­ling Box op­tions.</p>

    <p>MY MESSY BOX</p>
    <p>When Mr Jeff Lim, 34, saw how his son Me­dion, now nine, ben­e­fited from sen­sory play as a tod­dler, it sparked the idea for his busi­ness, as he found it dif­fi­cult to source for sen­sory ac­tiv­i­ties in 2013. Each box con­tains three to four ac­tiv­i­ties, and caters to four age groups be­tween one and six years old. It also sells sen­sory kits and gift sets.</p>
    <p>Prices: A box costs $42, but prices are lower with a subscripti­on. A three-month subscripti­on, for in­stance, is $114 or $38 a box and ship­ping is free in Sin­ga­pore. Info: mymessy­box.sg</p>
    <p>ONE HAPPY BOOK</p>
    <p>Sis­ters Shan­ice Goh, 33, and Sh­er­nice Goh, 28, who love books, founded this book subscripti­on ser­vice last year. It caters to chil­dren from new­borns up to age seven and cus­tomises books based on the de­vel­op­ment stages, as well as the child’s in­ter­ests. There are seven cat­e­gories.</p>
    <p>Prices: From $19.90 a month for two books for new­borns to six-month-olds, to $45.90 a month for four books for kids aged five to seven. Tracked de­liv­ery costs $3.90. It has fam­ily bun­dle pack­ages for fam­i­lies with two or more chil­dren.</p>

    <p>SQUIZZEL BOX</p>
    <p>Hop­ing to nur­ture life­long learning in their young chil­dren, Mr Austen Ho, 43, and a part­ner set up Squizzel Box last year to of­fer learning ac­tiv­ity boxes for kids aged three and up. The ac­tiv­i­ties aim to de­velop skills in ar­eas such as lan­guage, numer­acy and so­cial and emo­tional de­vel­op­ment. It of­fers ad­di­tional re­sources on its Face­book and In­sta­gram pages. Prices: Pay $39.90 a month for a box that can be can­celled any time, or com­mit to pre­paid plans from three to 12 months that cost less per box. It also sells sin­gle boxes. Ship­ping is free for sub­scribers.</p>

    <p>DABOX</p>
    <p>Da Lit­tle Arts School founder Eileen Yeo, 42, first ven­tured into the learning box busi­ness seven years ago with a pho­tog­ra­phy-themed kit.</p>
    <p>She res­ur­rected the idea dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker when her art en­rich­ment cen­tre was forced to close. DaBox proved to be a hit, with vari­a­tions launched every three weeks or so.</p>
    <p>The boxes are sea­sonal and new themes are launched on so­cial me­dia as she lacks the re­sources to op­er­ate it on a subscripti­on ba­sis. The next theme is Christ­mas. Ms Yeo also of­fers DaBox Mini, a smaller-sized craft box that is pop­u­lar for birthdays. Boxes come in two vari­a­tions: one for ages three to six, and an­other for kids aged six and older.</p>
    <p>Prices: $38 for DaBox. Add $5 for ship­ping or col­lect it from the cen­tre at Rochester Mall. DaBox Mini costs $10 to $12 for a min­i­mum or­der of 10 boxes, with three weeks’ ad­vance no­tice, and de­liv­ery is $12.</p>

    <p>LE BOX</p>
    <p>Tu­tor Jan­ice Wong, 41, started her Chi­nese learning box ser­vice three years ago when her son Kaeven, now six, dis­liked the lan­guage. She could not find en­gag­ing ac­tiv­i­ties to pique his in­ter­est, so she cre­ated them. As she runs it alone, she does not of­fer a subscripti­on plan, but launches new themes every 90 days or so via Face­book and In­sta­gram. Boxes are lim­ited to about 30 to 50 units a theme and tend to move fast – her space-themed box last month sold out within 24 hours. Suit­able for kids aged 21/ to about 2 eight. Prices: About $55 a box Info: fb.com/LeBoxSin­ga­pore;</p>
