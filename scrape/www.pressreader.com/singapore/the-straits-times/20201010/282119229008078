    <p>I read with dis­ap­point­ment Senior Min­is­ter of State for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Amy Khor’s re­sponse to a Gov­ern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee’s call for a ban on res­i­dents smok­ing at the win­dows or bal­conies of their homes (GPC calls for ban on smok­ing at win­dows or bal­conies at home, Oct 6).</p>
    <p>She said that of the 11,400 com­plaints linked to smok­ing in the first four months of this year, 58 per cent were in res­i­den­tial es­tates, and of these, only 5 per cent in­volved smok­ing in homes. This may not be an ac­cu­rate pic­ture of the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple are not re­port­ing smok­ing in homes sim­ply be­cause it is not against the law, and the rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties have re­peat­edly told them so.</p>
    <p>There­fore, most are of the view that it is point­less to com­plain, al­though they re­main dis­traught. Many are also afraid of sour­ing re­la­tion­ships with their neigh­bours who smoke.</p>
    <p>If the Gov­ern­ment wants to know how se­vere the prob­lem of sec­ond-hand smoke in homes is, house­hold sur­veys can be con­ducted by the Hous­ing Board and Man­age­ment Cor­po­ra­tion Strata Ti­tle of con­do­mini­ums.</p>
    <p>Dr Khor also said “the best way to pro­tect against sec­ond-hand smoke is for fam­ily mem­bers and neigh­bours to help smok­ers cut down and quit smok­ing”.</p>
    <p>The re­al­ity is that many help­less non-smok­ers have al­ready tried to do so, with the of­fend­ing smok­ers not budg­ing and re­tort­ing that it is their right to smoke in their own homes.</p>
    <p>Data from in­ter­na­tional stud­ies fur­ther shows that a mere 5 per cent of smok­ers suc­ceed in quit­ting with­out as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>At the very least, smok­ers should be ob­li­gated to close their doors and win­dows when they smoke at home, as pro­posed by MP Derrick Goh. We can­not pre­dict when smok­ers will light up, and by the time we smell it, toxic smoke has al­ready drifted into our homes.</p>
    <p>I hope pol­i­cy­mak­ers will take a se­ri­ous look at the sever­ity of this pub­lic health is­sue and en­act con­crete mea­sures now to pro­tect non-smok­ers from neigh­bours’ smoke drift.</p>
    <p>Liu I-Chun</p>
    <p>Peo­ple are not re­port­ing smok­ing in homes sim­ply be­cause it is not against the law, and the rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties have re­peat­edly told them so. There­fore, most are of the view that it is point­less to com­plain, al­though they re­main dis­traught.</p>
