    <p>Amid the tra­vails of Sin­ga­pore’s drawn-out bat­tle against the Covid-19 pan­demic this year, there emerged a sil­ver lin­ing for Dr Noel Yeo.</p>
    <p>As se­nior vice-pres­i­dent at Park­way Pan­tai, he was in the thick of var­i­ous oper­a­tions, in­clud­ing the trans­fer of pa­tients to the four pri­vate hos­pi­tals in the Park­way chain to free up pub­lic fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, he was among 20 new dis­trict coun­cil­lors ap­pointed to the Cen­tral Sin­ga­pore Com­mu­nity De­vel­op­ment Coun­cil (CDC).</p>
    <p>Speak­ing af­ter the vir­tual cer­e­mony to mark the ap­point­ments, Dr Yeo said: “While serv­ing on Sin­ga­pore’s front lines, I ex­pe­ri­enced the for­ti­tude, re­silience and sol­i­dar­ity of our peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“This ap­point­ment is a timely op­por­tu­nity for me to con­trib­ute more and learn how to bet­ter con­trib­ute, so that we can help the vul­ner­a­ble and those in need.”</p>
    <p>The fall­out from the pan­demic also means the CDC model, more than ever, must re­main rel­e­vant, and help build up vol­un­teer and donor net­works to link up the needs of res­i­dents with re­sources, said Cen­tral Sin­ga­pore Dis­trict Mayor Denise Phua.</p>
    <p>Ms Phua, who is an MP for Jalan Be­sar GRC, also spoke about more com­mu­nity-level “al­liances for ac­tion”.</p>
    <p>At the event yes­ter­day, another 42 coun­cil­lors were reap­pointed to Cen­tral Sin­ga­pore CDC for a new term of of­fice that started on July 27 and will run for three years.</p>
    <p>Ms Phua called on all 62 coun­cil­lors to be closely in­volved in up­com­ing ini­tia­tives by Cen­tral Sin­ga­pore CDC – such as job schemes, men­tal health pro­mo­tion, life­long learn­ing pro­grammes and more fi­nan­cial sup­port for those im­pacted by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Another fresh face among the dis­trict’s coun­cil­lors, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ethan Chong, who teaches sys­tems en­gi­neer­ing at the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy, said he is keen to lend his sup­port in the area of life­long learn­ing, among other things.</p>
    <p>“As in­dus­tries have been chang­ing rapidly, learn­ing new ways of do­ing things bet­ter is ide­ally an on­go­ing process for in­di­vid­u­als,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Phua said she will con­tinue to pay at­ten­tion to the vul­ner­a­ble in her dis­trict, in­clud­ing the home­less, rough sleep­ers and card­board col­lec­tors.</p>
    <p>She added: “We will do our part on the ground to re­duce in­equal­ity, to raise in­clu­sive­ness and to in­spire ev­ery­one we meet, to do some­thing for the com­mon good.”</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong, who was guest of hon­our at the event, said CDCs and their coun­cil­lors are a cru­cial bridge be­tween res­i­dents and the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>PM Lee, who is also an MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC, said: “You are our eyes and ears on the ground, help­ing us iden­tify where res­i­dents are un­der­served. You are also our hands and legs, mo­bil­is­ing the com­mu­nity, re­sources, part­ners, to im­ple­ment pro­grammes to bridge these gaps.</p>
    <p>“This per­sonal con­nec­tion that you cre­ate, de­liv­er­ing gov­ern­ment ser­vices with a hu­man face and hu­man touch, helps us not only to re­spond quickly and ef­fec­tively to res­i­dents in times of need, but also to build the spirit of a car­ing so­ci­ety in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee praised the ef­forts of Ms Phua – mayor since 2014 – in set­ting up over 50 wide-rang­ing com­mu­nity pro­grammes, and for work­ing with other CDCs to help the needy dur­ing the pan­demic, in­clud­ing through the Stu­dent Meals and Voucher schemes.</p>
    <p>He said: “Covid-19 or not, we need in­sti­tu­tions like Cen­tral Sin­ga­pore CDC to help hold our so­ci­ety to­gether... and set the right tone to want to help one another.”</p>
