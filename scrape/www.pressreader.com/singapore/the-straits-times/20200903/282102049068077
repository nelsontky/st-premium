    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and eco­nomic down­turn must not come at the ex­pense of its peo­ple, es­pe­cially the more vul­ner­a­ble in the com­mu­nity, said sev­eral MPs in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing dur­ing the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress, the MPs said peo­ple – such as those with phys­i­cal or men­tal dis­abil­i­ties, se­niors, low-in­come fam­i­lies and dis­placed work­ers – should not be left be­hind as the Repub­lic pro­gresses.</p>
    <p>Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Pung­gol GRC) said busi­nesses must do their part to pro­vide fair op­por­tu­ni­ties for work­ers.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing the case of a res­i­dent who lost a foot to di­a­betes and is now im­mo­bile, Mr Sharael said new norms of work amid the cur­rent cri­sis mean that this res­i­dent, be­ing alert and men­tally ca­pa­ble, is as pro­duc­tive as an able-bod­ied per­son.</p>
    <p>Yet, the res­i­dent has found it dif­fi­cult to land a job, Mr Sharael said, call­ing for em­ploy­ers to be more in­clu­sive when it comes to jobs for se­niors, the less abled and care­givers.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment, busi­nesses and cit­i­zens must also work together and ex­pand op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore’s se­nior work­force, he added.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, Mr Alvin Tan, Minister of State for Trade and In­dus­try and Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth, fo­cused on the need to do more and fos­ter an in­clu­sive so­ci­ety for those with men­tal and phys­i­cal dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>In his speech, Mr Tan cited how a res­i­dent re­fused to call the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment helpline be­cause she felt it was shame­ful to do so.</p>
    <p>He said there is a need for in­clu­sive poli­cies and norms to en­sure that peo­ple feel safe and unashamed to use men­tal health re­sources.</p>
    <p>Ms Ch­eryl Chan (East Coast GRC) said groups such as vul­ner­a­ble se­niors, fam­i­lies with lit­tle fi­nan­cial sup­port and peo­ple with spe­cial needs are par­tic­u­larly af­fected in be­ing able to cope with the pres­sures and stress brought about by chal­lenges from the ex­ter­nal en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>She asked: “While state re­sources have al­ways largely been chan­nelled to as­sist the vul­ner­a­ble and the low-in­come groups, have we con­sid­ered what other safety nets they re­quire or what may make them feel more com­forted in know­ing they are not left be­hind as</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore pro­gresses?”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans also need more than fi­nan­cial aid as they re­build their lives post-Covid-19, Ms Chan said, adding that emo­tional sup­port and ground-up ini­tia­tives are the “non-of­fi­cial but necessary ad­di­tional safety nets that will truly make a dif­fer­ence to peo­ple’s lives”.</p>
    <p>Progress Sin­ga­pore Party NonCon­stituency MP Hazel Poa, in her speech, called for an en­hance­ment to the Covid-19 Sup­port Grant, such that it can of­fer fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance for a longer pe­riod to those af­fected by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Oth­er­wise, there will be much anx­i­ety and pain in many fam­i­lies, which will, in turn, slow down our re­cov­ery,” she said.</p>
    <p>The grant pro­vides up to $800 a month for three months to Sin­ga­pore­ans who are un­em­ployed or have suf­fered sig­nif­i­cant in­come loss due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ms Poa also sug­gested al­low­ing Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund mem­bers who have lost their jobs to bor­row from their own CPF ac­counts, to cope with the fi­nan­cial stress amid the Covid-19 cri­sis. These loans can be re­paid af­ter they find new em­ploy­ment, she said.</p>
