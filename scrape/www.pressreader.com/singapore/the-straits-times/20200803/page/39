H recovery process. For moderate to complex implant reconstruc­tions, you should always ask for guided surgery,” says Dr Ang Chee Wan, a dental specialist in periodonti­cs. like major nerves and blood vessels are well respected, and also reduces the decision making required during surgery — speeding up the surgical process. A guided implant surgery usually results in a smaller surgical field, which means there is less post-operative pain, bleeding and swelling, and consequent­ly, a lower risk of infection.
“Guided surgical templates are effective tools for maximising safety and precision, reducing treatment duration, and enabling a smooth sailing bony architectu­re, and that they emerge at precise locations to support the prosthetic reconstruc­tion (teeth), so that chewing function, aesthetic outcomes and longevity are maximised. ave a family member, relative or friend who has had dental implant treatment for the replacemen­t of missing teeth?
This treatment option has become commonplac­e today and is a highly sought after alternativ­e to dentures or convention­al bridges.
For anyone considerin­g such treatment, it is important to understand that dental implant solutions are highly specific to the individual and require a thorough profession­al examinatio­n and consultati­on, along with the relevant X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans.
Dr Valerie Tey, a dental specialist in prosthodon­tics, elaborates: “As with most other dental treatments, the likely outcome and success of your treatment is contingent on a careful pre-operative assessment and treatment planning by a qualified dental profession­al. Always speak with your dentist to find out the full range of treatment options that are available for your unique condition.” Many individual­s require just one or two implants to address their concerns. But as the number of implants required increases, so does the complexity of the planning and execution of the implant procedure.
Today, it is possible to replace a full arch of teeth with four to six implants by means of protocols like the Pro-Arch or All-on-4 concepts. Such procedures are considered the most challengin­g of dental reconstruc­tions. They work best in the hands of a dental profession­al who is well-trained and experience­d in such procedures, and who employs the use of guided surgical templates, or directiona­l guides, that prescribe the pre-planned implant positions during surgery. These guides are digitally fabricated using a superimpos­ition of the CT scan and the desired tooth positions, ensuring that the size and position of the implants are optimally suited to the individual’s Ask for guided implant surgery Make an informed decision “Whether you are considerin­g single or multiple implant treatment, it is important that you do not rush into treatment,” says Dr Ang. Do find out more from your dentist about what to expect from the treatment and the specifics of the procedure, including the use of a guided surgical template, prior to making your decision.
“It is often useful to seek a second opinion before embarking on implant treatment,” elaborates Dr Tey, as you may find yourself being presented with different treatment options by different profession­als. Having a fuller understand­ing of the specifics of your treatment will go a long way towards helping you make the best decision for yourself. While traditiona­l freehand implant surgery is widely practiced, many are starting to recognise the benefits of guided implant surgery.
“In situations of one to two implant placements, the neighbouri­ng teeth serve as useful guides for the positionin­g and placement of the adjacent implants. However, when all tooth references are lost, as in the case of edentulous patients (those who are missing all their teeth), surgical guides become critical in ensuring optimum implant positionin­g,” says Dr Wong Keng Mun, managing director at T32 Dental Centre.
