    <p>Al­though Ms Yvonne Eng was spared from re­ceiv­ing a pink slip when her pre­vi­ous com­pany an­nounced a re­trench­ment ex­er­cise in March, it was still a wake-up call for the for­mer hu­man re­sources (HR) of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>“I thought to my­self that I could not con­tinue be­ing stag­nant,” said Ms Eng, 45, who has been work­ing in HR for more than 20 years.</p>
    <p>“I had to start learn­ing some­thing new to up­grade my­self be­cause who knows what would hap­pen in the fu­ture,” she added.</p>
    <p>So, she turned in her res­ig­na­tion that same month and ap­plied for a role as a project ex­ec­u­tive at In-Ex­pat Con­sul­tant, a de­sign and build con­sul­tancy. She had heard about the job op­por­tu­nity from a friend.</p>
    <p>She joined the com­pany in June and is now un­der­go­ing a six­month Pro­fes­sional Con­ver­sion Pro­gramme for De­sign­ers (Fur­ni­ture and Life­style) to help her ease into her new role.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme, which is supported by Work­force Sin­ga­pore, com­prises both class­room and on-the-job train­ing.</p>
    <p>It helps pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs) such as Ms Eng to make a ca­reer switch to de­sign-re­lated oc­cu­pa­tions in the fur­ni­ture and life­style in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Through the course, Ms Eng is pick­ing up skills in de­sign pro­to­typ­ing, the pro­fes­sional prac­tice of de­sign, ma­te­ri­als and fur­ni­ture-mak­ing tech­nol­ogy, and learn­ing to use Pytha, a 3-D draw­ing soft­ware.</p>
    <p>While these are com­pletely new to her, Ms Eng, who is mar­ried with a 10-year-old son, said she does not feel daunted.</p>
    <p>In­stead, she is ex­cited and is ap­pre­cia­tive of her new em­ployer for giv­ing her a chance to take on a new chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>“If I don’t learn now, the younger ones will catch up.</p>
    <p>“At least there is now a chance for me to try some­thing new, so I will do my best,” she added.</p>
