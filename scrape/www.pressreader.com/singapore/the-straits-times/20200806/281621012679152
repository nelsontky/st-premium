    <p>Pop­u­lar mes­sag­ing ser­vice What­sApp has stepped up the fight against dis­in­for­ma­tion and fake news by rolling out a new fea­ture to al­low users to check the con­tents of vi­ral mes­sages.</p>
    <p>The fact-check fea­ture will ap­pear as a mag­ni­fy­ing glass icon next to mes­sages that have been for­warded through five or more peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Tap­ping the icon will al­low users to up­load the mes­sage onto their Web browser to per­form Google searches for re­lated news, so users can do their fact-check­ing – with­out What­sApp ever see­ing the mes­sage it­self.</p>
    <p>A screen­shot on What­sApp’s blog shows that the fea­ture will al­low a mes­sage con­tain­ing the claim that “drink­ing fresh boiled gar­lic water will cure Covid-19” to bring up three fact-check­ing web­sites stat­ing that it is false.</p>
    <p>“We’re pi­lot­ing a sim­ple way to dou­ble-check these mes­sages by tap­ping a mag­ni­fy­ing glass but­ton in the chat,” said What­sApp in an­nounc­ing the move in a blog post on Mon­day. “Pro­vid­ing a sim­ple way to search mes­sages that have been for­warded many times may help peo­ple find news re­sults or other sources of in­for­ma­tion about con­tent they have re­ceived.”</p>
    <p>The fea­ture will be rolled out as a pi­lot ini­tially in seven coun­tries: Brazil, Italy, Ire­land, Mex­ico, Spain, Bri­tain and the United States. Users need to down­load the lat­est ver­sion of the app.</p>
    <p>Asked when the fea­ture will be rolled out in Sin­ga­pore, a spokesman here told The Straits Times :“We will be closely mon­i­tor­ing this pi­lot and will make any de­ci­sions on fu­ture phases based on user feed­back to both What­sApp and Google.”</p>
    <p>It is the lat­est at­tempt by What­sApp, which has two bil­lion users world­wide, to slow the dis­sem­i­na­tion of fake news.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, What­sApp tight­ened global lim­its on the for­ward­ing of mes­sages that had not come from a close con­tact to only a sin­gle chat at a time. The pre­vi­ous limit, in­tro­duced last year, was five chats.</p>
    <p>The limit has been tight­ened grad­u­ally over the last two years. In 2018, the limit was 20 chats. Be­fore that, users were able to for­ward a mes­sage to 250 groups at once.</p>
    <p>Widely for­warded mes­sages can be dan­ger­ous as they of­ten come with the im­plicit ap­proval of a friend or fam­ily mem­ber. But crack­ing down on the spread of fake news on the plat­form has not been easy as mes­sages are en­crypted. This al­lows users to ex­change videos, texts and im­ages with­out any over­sight from in­de­pen­dent fact-check­ers or even What­sApp it­self.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, in In­dia, Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi’s mes­sage in March to In­di­ans to show their ap­pre­ci­a­tion for front-line med­i­cal work­ers by clap­ping and bang­ing plates was mis­rep­re­sented as a virus-beat­ing tac­tic via What­sApp.</p>
    <p>One mes­sage on What­sApp read: “Clap­ping, conch blow­ing by (1.3 BIL­LION) peo­ple at the same time will cre­ate so much vi­bra­tions that virus will lose all po­tency.”</p>
    <p>Fear­ing false in­for­ma­tion would hin­der In­dia’s ef­forts to con­trol the pan­demic, its Press In­for­ma­tion Bureau’s fact-check­ing team re­sponded on so­cial me­dia with: “No! The vi­bra­tion gen­er­ated by clap­ping to­gether will NOT de­stroy #Coron­avirus in­fec­tion.”</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, gov­ern­ment agen­cies de­bunked about 40 in­stances of spec­u­la­tion, ru­mours, scams and out­right false­hoods about the Covid-19 out­break over all so­cial me­dia plat­forms in the first five months of this year.</p>
    <p>What­sApp’s par­ent firm Face­book has also been the sub­ject of global scru­tiny over its role in the spread of fake news and dis­in­for­ma­tion.</p>
