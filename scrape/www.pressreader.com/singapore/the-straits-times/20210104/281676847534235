    <p>BANGKOK • Thai­land’s gov­ern­ment held off or­der­ing new na­tion­wide busi­ness shut­downs yes­ter­day amid a wave of coro­n­avirus cases, but em­pow­ered some pro­vin­cial gov­er­nors to set their own re­stric­tions and pleaded with the pub­lic not to travel.</p>
    <p>Thai­land, which had largely con­trolled the virus by mid-2020, saw a sec­ond wave of out­breaks be­gin­ning last month.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, it con­firmed 315 new coro­n­avirus cases, the ma­jor­ity due to lo­cal trans­mis­sion, bring­ing its to­tal to 7,694 cases and 64 deaths since its first case in Jan­uary last year.</p>
    <p>Sa­mut Sakhon, a prov­ince south of Bangkok where the cur­rent out­break started, re­ported 541 ad­di­tional cases yes­ter­day. That num­ber will be added to the of­fi­cial tally to­day, its health of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>The coun­try also re­ported its first known case of a more con­ta­gious vari­ant of the coro­n­avirus called B.1.1.7 yes­ter­day, Dr Yong Poovo­rawan, a se­nior virol­o­gist from Chu­la­longkorn Univer­sity in Bangkok, said in a post on his of­fi­cial Face­book page.</p>
    <p>The vari­ant was found in a fam­ily of four who were in quar­an­tine af­ter ar­riv­ing in Thai­land from Bri­tain, but Dr Yong said there is no risk of that vari­ant be­ing spread in Thai­land.</p>
    <p>Depart­ment of Dis­ease Con­trol direc­tor-gen­eral Opas Karnkaw­in­pong said the Health Min­istry has rec­om­mended to the gov­ern­ment to re­strict all flights from Bri­tain un­til there is more in­for­ma­tion on the new strain.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials said the cur­rent do­mes­tic out­break is linked to il­le­gal bor­der mi­gra­tion from neigh­bour­ing Myan­mar.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has des­ig­nated 28 prov­inces, in­clud­ing Bangkok, as high-risk zones, rec­om­mend­ing sus­pen­sion of some busi­nesses and crowded ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Some min­istries and agen­cies have al­ready is­sued new re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>The Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry has or­dered all pub­lic and pri­vate schools and vo­ca­tional train­ing cen­tres to close from to­day un­til the end of the month.</p>
    <p>The Thai Re­tail­ers As­so­ci­a­tion has also an­nounced that all shop­ping malls around the coun­try should close at 9pm daily, an hour ear­lier than the usual clos­ing time, a state­ment said.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties in Bangkok had ear­lier closed en­ter­tain­ment venues, nurs­eries, gyms and mas­sage par­lours, while keep­ing open shop­ping malls, restau­rants and pub­lic parks.</p>
