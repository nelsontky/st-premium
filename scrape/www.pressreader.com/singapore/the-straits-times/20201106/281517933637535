    <p>LON­DON • Eng­land’s 56 mil­lion peo­ple en­tered a sec­ond lock­down yes­ter­day, with many down­ing a fi­nal round of drinks and in some cities scuf­fling with po­lice as scep­ti­cism mounts about the re­turn to strin­gent curbs.</p>
    <p>Late-night rev­ellers clashed with po­lice, in­clud­ing in parts of Lon­don and the north­ern city of Leeds, while lengthy traf­fic jams de­vel­oped in the hours be­fore mid­night as mo­torists sought to es­cape the cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>Hair­dressers have been deluged this week, and wind­ing queues snaked out­side clothes and other re­tail­ers on the fi­nal day of pre-lock­down shop­ping.</p>
    <p>Last week­end, Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son aban­doned a sys­tem of re­gional curbs and an­nounced an Eng­land-wide shut­down, af­ter dire warn­ings that hos­pi­tals could soon be over­whelmed.</p>
    <p>While opin­ion polls sug­gest over­all pub­lic back­ing for the stay-ath­ome pol­icy, con­cerns are mount­ing about the im­pact on the econ­omy and on men­tal health.</p>
    <p>“For us, it’s ab­so­lutely in­sane,” said Mr Faraj Faraj, head of op­er­a­tions at the Lon­don food mar­ket Mer­cato Metropoli­tano.</p>
    <p>“To go through this again, just be­fore Christ­mas, is ac­tu­ally death by a thou­sand cuts. We will adapt, we will sur­vive, but we have to take a dif­fer­ent ap­proach,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I know we need to get the cases un­der con­trol, but let’s use this time to get our con­tact trac­ing done prop­erly.”</p>
    <p>To shore up Bri­tain’s reel­ing econ­omy, the Bank of Eng­land yes­ter­day un­veiled an ex­tra £150 bil­lion (S$265 bil­lion), on top of new mea­sures to sub­sidise the wages of fur­loughed work­ers un­til March.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son, in­sist­ing the lock­down will end on Dec 2, is pin­ning his hopes on an am­bi­tious new pro­gramme of Covid-19 testing to de­tect and iso­late in­fected peo­ple, start­ing with a city-wide trial launch­ing in Liver­pool today.</p>
    <p>But so far, de­spite gov­ern­ment</p>
    <p>spend­ing of £12 bil­lion on testing pro­grammes, re­searchers say that only one in five of con­firmed cases has been prop­erly iso­lat­ing, and of­fi­cials have been fail­ing to reach most of their con­tacts.</p>
    <p>When the coun­try en­tered its first lock­down in March in spring­time, sup­port was strong. But com­pli­ance with coro­n­avirus mea­sures has been fray­ing the longer they drag on into the win­ter.</p>
    <p>A size­able mi­nor­ity of 34 MPs from Mr John­son’s rul­ing Con­ser­va­tive Party re­belled against the new mea­sures on Wed­nes­day dur­ing a vote in Par­lia­ment hours be­fore they took ef­fect.</p>
    <p>But Mr John­son pointed to the ex­pe­ri­ence of France and oth­ers in Europe, where coun­tries have been seek­ing mu­tual sup­port to pre­vent their own health sys­tems get­ting swamped.</p>
    <p>“I’m not pre­pared to take the risk with the lives of the Bri­tish peo­ple,” he told Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>The re­stric­tions in­clude a re­turn to work­ing from home where pos­si­ble and the clo­sure of all non-es­sen­tial shops and ser­vices. Schools will re­main open, how­ever.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain is among the world’s hard­est-hit coun­tries, with nearly 48,000 deaths linked to Covid-19 from over one mil­lion pos­i­tive cases.</p>
