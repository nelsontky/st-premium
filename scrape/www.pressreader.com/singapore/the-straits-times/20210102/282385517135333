    <p>Grounded by the Covid-19 pan­demic, two pho­tog­ra­phers who usu­ally spend most of their time trav­el­ling out­side Sin­ga­pore de­cided to doc­u­ment the wild res­i­dents at Pasir Ris Park in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>On Christ­mas Eve, they re­leased a video en­ti­tled Res­i­dents Of The Park, which was com­mended by Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs Des­mond Tan on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>“When I first watched the video, I was awed by the con­tent and qual­ity of pro­duc­tion and it was only to­wards the end of the doc­u­men­tary that I re­alised it was shot en­tirely in Pasir Ris Park, and by two Pasir Ris res­i­dents,” said Mr Tan, who is also Min­is­ter of State for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment as well as an MP for Pasir Ris-Pung­gol GRC, in a Face­book post.</p>
    <p>The short film fol­lows the re­sults of a poll on wild an­i­mals in Pasir Ris es­tate re­leased on Dec 8 by Se­nior Min­is­ter Teo Chee Hean.</p>
    <p>The re­sults in­di­cated that most of the res­i­dents wanted wildlife roam­ing in their neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>Fight­ing mud­skip­pers and mat­ing horse­shoe crabs are just a few ex­hil­a­rat­ing se­quences cap­tured by pro­fes­sional na­ture and wildlife pho­tog­ra­pher Jayaprakas­h Joghee Bojan and artist Dan Ng, who both spent al­most ev­ery sin­gle day fol­low­ing the an­i­mals.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to help peo­ple fall in love with na­ture by show­ing them a dif­fer­ent per­spec­tive. We also made it free be­cause na­ture should be for ev­ery­one,” s a i d Mr Jayaprakas­h, 46.</p>
    <p>The 11-minute clip marks the first col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween Mr Jayaprakas­h and Mr Ng, 26, who met just four months ago at Pasir Ris Park.</p>
    <p>The un­likely part­ner­ship be­gan when a starstruck Ng asked Mr Jayaprakas­h, who was awarded Na­tional Ge­o­graphic Na­ture Pho­tog­ra­pher of the Year in 2017, for a selfie at Pasir Ris Park on Sept 1.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Jayaprakas­h: “Dan said he was a fan of my work on In­sta­gram when he asked for a selfie. I bumped into him again at the traf­fic sig­nal. Af­ter tak­ing a look at his work, I asked if he was keen to meet at 5.30am at Pasir Ris Beach to shoot some pho­tos.”</p>
    <p>That set off the project, which saw the duo spend­ing around half a day record­ing footage for about three months.</p>
    <p>“Most of it was wait­ing for things to hap­pen. Every­thing is first hand when shoot­ing an­i­mals so there’s no room for er­ror,” said Mr Ng, who is also a travel and life­style con­tent creator.</p>
    <p>“Travel pho­tog­ra­phy can be staged but for na­ture and wildlife pho­tog­ra­phy, you need to have the pa­tience to wait and find it,” added Mr Jayaprakas­h.</p>
    <p>They cred­ited their suc­cess in record­ing unusual sights partly to the res­i­dents liv­ing near the park.</p>
    <p>“We re­lied a lot on res­i­dents to in­form us about sight­ings of wildlife in the park. One res­i­dent, Peter, has been ob­serv­ing these crea­tures for around 20 years,” said Mr Jayaprakas­h.</p>
    <p>Be­yond sight­ings, mak­ing the video has also brought them closer to fre­quent vis­i­tors to the park.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally ap­pre­ci­ate all the gen­uine con­nec­tions that we have made while shoot­ing at Pasir Ris Park,” said Mr Ng.</p>
    <p>“There is this dog called Sum­mer who is cred­ited in the video.</p>
    <p>She’s like a ther­apy dog for ev­ery­one in this park,” added Mr Jayaprakas­h.</p>
    <p>The bud­ding part­ner­ship be­tween the two is set to con­tinue, with at least two episodes on wildlife in Sin­ga­pore in the pipe­line.</p>
    <p>“Dan was my find of 2020. He is an amaz­ing sto­ry­teller. Con­sid­er­ing the fact that he was new to wildlife, he sur­prised me with his abil­ity to learn so quickly in a short three-month span,” said Mr Jayaprakas­h.</p>
    <p>To which Mr Ng added: “All of this wouldn’t have hap­pened with­out him. Team­work makes the dream work.”</p>
    <p>PA­TIENCE IS KEY</p>
    <p>Travel pho­tog­ra­phy can be staged but for na­ture and wildlife pho­tog­ra­phy, you need to have the pa­tience to wait and find it. We re­lied a lot on res­i­dents to in­form us about sight­ings of wildlife in the park. One res­i­dent, Peter, has been ob­serv­ing these crea­tures for around 20 years.</p>
