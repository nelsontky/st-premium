    <p>Min­is­ter of State for Man­power and Ed­u­ca­tion Gan Siow Huang’s work back­ground strongly un­der­lined her call at a we­bi­nar yes­ter­day for more women to study and work in sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy fields. Women con­tinue to be un­der-rep­re­sented in the in­fo­comm and tech sec­tor, ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cial data.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter of State for Man­power and Ed­u­ca­tion Gan Siow Huang’s back­ground as an air traf­fic con­troller, and later a gen­eral, strongly un­der­lined her call yes­ter­day for more women to study and work in sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy fields.</p>
    <p>Women con­tinue to be un­der­rep­re­sented in the in­fo­comm and tech sec­tor, mak­ing up only about 30 per cent of the work­force last year, ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cial data.</p>
    <p>Draw­ing on her own ex­pe­ri­ences, Ms Gan told a Sin­ga­pore Women In Tech we­bi­nar that a belief in the mean­ing­ful­ness of the job was what at­tracted her to the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces and a ca­reer that spanned more than 25 years, say­ing: “It has to be some­thing you love to do.”</p>
    <p>She added that study­ing the sci­ence, tech­nol­ogy, en­gi­neer­ing and math­e­mat­ics (Stem) fields opens up a huge range of job pos­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“There are many ap­pli­ca­tions of Stem. It can be used for sav­ing lives, pro­tect­ing the coun­try, build­ing the econ­omy or help­ing the needy,” Ms Gan said.</p>
    <p>“There are lots and lots of pur­pose­ful (ap­pli­ca­tions) so it’s not about Stem for the sake of Stem but how you ap­ply it in or­der to help peo­ple. I think this is what will drive women to go into (Stem) more.”</p>
    <p>A high­light of yes­ter­day’s we­bi­nar was the re­lease of an in­au­gu­ral list hon­our­ing 100 out­stand­ing women in Sin­ga­pore’s tech­nol­ogy sec­tor – women whom Ms Gan de­scribed as role mod­els and trail­blaz­ers who show what is pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Women In Tech list was com­piled by the Sin­ga­pore Com­puter So­ci­ety in part­ner­ship with the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity (IMDA) and Me­di­a­corp.</p>
    <p>The 100 women were se­lected from more than 850 nom­i­na­tions and com­prise pro­fes­sion­als from the pub­lic and pri­vate sec­tors and academia. They in­clude Razer chief of staff and board mem­ber Pa­tri­cia Liu, Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity (NTU) As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor of bio­engi­neer­ing Sierin Lim and Com­fortDelGro chief tech­nol­ogy of­fi­cer Siew Yim Cheng.</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo is the pa­tron of the Sin­ga­pore Women In Tech move­ment, an IMDA ini­tia­tive to at­tract women to the in­fo­comm and tech­nol­ogy sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Part of the chal­lenge in clos­ing the gen­der gap is that it is not fully un­der­stood why girls are not tak­ing up Stem sub­jects, said NTU’s Prof Lim, a pan­el­list in one of the two di­a­logues held dur­ing the we­bi­nar.</p>
    <p>“We don’t know and that’s why it’s re­ally im­por­tant for us to un­der­stand the root cause of what is mo­ti­vat­ing them,” she added.</p>
    <p>“Only af­ter that can we de­velop and de­sign pro­grammes that would fit with the nar­ra­tive of why they choose Stem.”</p>
    <p>Fel­low pan­el­list Uma Thana Balasingam said un­con­scious bi­ases from fe­male tech pro­fes­sion­als them­selves can get in the way.</p>
    <p>“There are bi­ases I im­pose on my­self – what I call the ‘sticky floor’,” said Ms Balasingam, who is a vi­cepres­i­dent at Amer­i­can soft­ware com­pany VMware and one of those on the top 100 list.</p>
    <p>“So when women look at job de­scrip­tions, for ex­am­ple, they tend to feel they need to check all the boxes be­fore they ap­ply, whereas men might look at it and go, ‘Oh, six out of 10, I’m ab­so­lutely go­ing to rock this job’.”</p>
    <p>A se­cond com­po­nent to en­abling more women to join and ex­cel in the tech­nol­ogy sec­tor is the role that man­agers and lead­ers play, she added.</p>
    <p>“We know that most cor­po­rates to­day are run by men. They’re part of the chal­lenge, and part of the so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>“Step­ping into men­tor­ing and spon­sor­ing women is ab­so­lutely key. If men are not com­ing for­ward, then there’s only so much women can do for them­selves.”</p>
