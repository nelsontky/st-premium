    <p>Re­cent re­ports of Chi­nese in­volve­ment in a ura­nium pro­cess­ing fa­cil­ity in Saudi Ara­bia have raised questions about the king­dom’s nu­clear in­ten­tions – and cast the spot­light on China’s Mid­dle East pol­icy, says global af­fairs cor­re­spon­dent Jonathan Eyal (be­low).</p>
    <p>LON­DON Al-Ula is not ex­actly the best place to be at this time of the year.</p>
    <p>Although this small set­tle­ment of about 5,000 peo­ple in the north-west­ern tip of Saudi Ara­bia boasts a World Her­itage Site and has plenty of tourism po­ten­tial since it sat on the net­work of routes trans­port­ing spices be­tween In­dia and Europe for well over a mil­len­nium, it is usu­ally en­veloped in gloomy, grey desert clouds and an op­pres­sive, swel­ter­ing heat in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>This year, how­ever, quite a few peo­ple around the world are show­ing an in­ter­est in what is go­ing on there, although ad­mit­tedly, many of them do it from the com­fort of air-con­di­tioned rooms, con­trol­ling in­tel­li­gence satel­lites far away from the area.</p>
    <p>For, al­legedly, Al-Ula is the site of a Saudi fa­cil­ity for ex­tract­ing and pro­cess­ing ura­nium ore, which in turn may be one step in the oil king­dom’s drive to ac­quire nu­clear tech­nol­ogy. And to make mat­ters more in­ter­est­ing still, the fa­cil­ity ap­pears to have been con­structed with the help of China.</p>
    <p>Here, in one windswept cor­ner of a desert, may be a snap­shot of what is re­ally hap­pen­ing in the Mid­dle East: a re­newed and po­ten­tially dan­ger­ous nu­clear race, plus a rapidly evolv­ing Chi­nese pres­ence that is likely to change the re­gion’s strate­gic map.</p>
    <p>Saudi Ara­bia’s govern­ment has re­peat­edly said over the past week that not only has it no in­ten­tion of ac­quir­ing nu­clear weapons, but it also “cat­e­gor­i­cally de­nies” hav­ing built a ura­nium ore fa­cil­ity in the Al-Ula area.</p>
    <p>But at the same time, it ad­mit­ted that min­eral ex­trac­tion – and this includes ura­nium – is a key part of the coun­try’s eco­nomic diver­si­fi­ca­tion strat­egy, and the ac­qui­si­tion of nu­clear tech­nol­ogy for civil­ian use re­mains one of the coun­try’s key ob­jec­tives.</p>
    <p>Cru­cially, Saudi Ara­bia also ad­mit­ted that its govern­ment does have a con­tract with Chi­nese en­ti­ties over ura­nium ex­plo­ration.</p>
    <p>It is worth point­ing out that there is noth­ing il­le­gal in what the Saudis may be do­ing. They are per­fectly en­ti­tled to mine their re­sources and are per­fectly jus­ti­fied in de­vel­op­ing a ca­pa­bil­ity to pro­duce nu­clear power for civil­ian use; none of th­ese ac­tions vi­o­lates in­ter­na­tional treaties.</p>
    <p>Although it may be blessed with one of the world’s big­gest re­serves of oil and pos­sesses con­sid­er­able quan­ti­ties of nat­u­ral gas, such is Saudi Ara­bia’s need for elec­tric­ity that with­out the avail­abil­ity of nu­clear power, the coun­try could well be trans­formed into a net im­porter of both of the commoditie­s that made it rich, within just a decade from now.</p>
    <p>Still, this is only one side of the story.</p>
    <p>Re­ports about the Al-Ula fa­cil­ity sur­faced over the past few days in a num­ber of top US news­pa­pers, a sure in­di­ca­tion that they em­anate from a govern­ment source in Wash­ing­ton, and are clearly in­tended to force the Saudis into a broader de­bate about what they may be do­ing.</p>
    <p>For the al­leged fa­cil­ity is ap­par­ently not only con­cerned with ex­tract­ing ura­nium ore, a com­mod­ity that ex­ists in rea­son­able quan­ti­ties in both Saudi Ara­bia and neigh­bour­ing Jor­dan, but is also de­signed to ex­tract “yel­low­cake” from the ura­nium, a chem­i­cal process that trans­forms the ore into a fine pow­der.</p>
    <p>That in it­self is not very sig­nif­i­cant, for the yel­low­cake would then have to be con­verted into a com­pound called ura­nium hex­aflu­o­ride be­fore it be­comes use­ful for a nu­clear power pro­ject.</p>
    <p>It takes mul­ti­ple ad­di­tional steps to en­rich ura­nium suf­fi­ciently for it to power a civil nu­clear en­ergy plant, and much higher en­rich­ment lev­els still be­fore ura­nium can fuel a nu­clear weapon.</p>
    <p>In short, Saudi Ara­bia, which has no op­er­at­ing nu­clear re­ac­tors or ca­pac­ity to en­rich ura­nium, is years – if not decades – away from ac­quir­ing nu­clear weapons, even if one as­sumes that this is the coun­try’s ul­ti­mate ob­jec­tive.</p>
    <p>Nonethe­less, the milling of ura­nium into yel­low­cake may be an in­di­ca­tion that the king­dom wants to keep its op­tions open about ac­quir­ing all the var­i­ous steps to­wards a nu­clear ca­pa­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>The rea­sons for do­ing so are not hard to fathom. For, as Saudi Crown Prince Mo­hammed bin Sal­man made clear only two years ago, “if Iran de­vel­oped a nu­clear bomb, we will fol­low suit as soon as pos­si­ble”.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion of ac­quir­ing a nu­clear ca­pa­bil­ity to match that of Iran – their dead­li­est foe – has dom­i­nated Saudi se­cu­rity plan­ning for decades.</p>
    <p>There is plenty of cir­cum­stan­tial ev­i­dence that the Saudis helped fi­nance Pak­istan’s nu­clear quest, largely in the hope that Pak­istani nu­clear bombs could pro­vide an off-the-shelf mil­i­tary ca­pa­bil­ity for</p>
    <p>Saudi Ara­bia in times of need.</p>
    <p>But that was never a sat­is­fac­tory so­lu­tion, so it is pos­si­ble that, faced with ev­i­dence of Ira­nian ad­vances in nu­clear ca­pa­bil­i­ties, Saudi Ara­bia has now de­cided to ac­cel­er­ate its own projects.</p>
    <p>THE U.S. AN­GLE</p>
    <p>In the past, such plans were usu­ally quashed by the United States, which knew how to ap­ply pressure on the Saudi au­thor­i­ties to de­sist.</p>
    <p>The US con­tin­ues to claim that it is keen to of­fer Saudi Ara­bia ac­cess to civil­ian nu­clear power at a fast pace and lower cost, pro­vided the Saudis sign up to strin­gent pre­con­di­tions that se­verely re­strict their abil­ity to en­rich, process and re­pro­cess nu­clear fuel.</p>
    <p>Now, it ap­pears that the Saudis have found a way to by­pass th­ese US hur­dles – by turn­ing to China.</p>
    <p>It is al­most cer­tain that what­ever fa­cil­i­ties are be­ing in­stalled and op­er­ated at Al-Ula, th­ese would have been built by the Chi­nese, un­der a con­tract signed by the Saudis a few years ago.</p>
    <p>CHINA’S FOR­AYS</p>
    <p>This Chi­nese in­volve­ment may be part of a more spec­tac­u­lar foray by Bei­jing into the quick­sands of the Mid­dle East.</p>
    <p>For decades, China has been care­ful to bal­ance its in­volve­ment in the re­gion. Not weighed down by the heavy bag­gage of colo­nial­ism in the way that Bri­tain, France and the United States are, China was able to prom­ise friend­ship to ev­ery­one, with­out pay­ing any po­lit­i­cal price.</p>
    <p>Back in 2016, Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping un­veiled with great fan­fare his coun­try’s “Arab Pol­icy Pa­per”, a sig­nal – an­a­lysts around the world be­lieved at that time – of a new Chi­nese en­gage­ment in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>But noth­ing ever came out of it, and Chi­nese of­fi­cials would strug­gle to­day to even re­call what that pa­per con­tained.</p>
    <p>In re­al­ity, China ben­e­fited from be­ing a po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic hedge to al­most ev­ery­one in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>It suits the Ira­ni­ans to treat China as an ally be­cause they do not have many other op­tions. The Chi­nese also claim to be great up­hold­ers of the plight of the Pales­tini­ans; at the United Na­tions and in other world in­sti­tu­tions, China of­ten sup­ports anti-Is­rael res­o­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>But Bei­jing’s big­gest tech­no­log­i­cal and mil­i­tary re­la­tion­ship in the re­gion is with none other than Is­rael. For it suits Is­rael to play the friend­ship game with Bei­jing, in the hope of tam­ing Chi­nese sup­port for rad­i­cal Arab gov­ern­ments.</p>
    <p>Ei­ther way, Pres­i­dent Xi is prob­a­bly the world’s only leader able to in­clude both the Ira­nian and Saudi cap­i­tals in the same trip to the re­gion and be greeted warmly in both, as he was when he vis­ited the Mid­dle East last year.</p>
    <p>In essence, the Chi­nese have ap­peared suc­cess­ful in find­ing the mirac­u­lous me­dian line be­tween de­riv­ing all the eco­nomic ad­van­tages of en­gage­ment and not ac­quir­ing the li­a­bil­i­ties. They have done so by be­ing care­ful about how much they waded into any con­flict.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there are signs that China is now ready to con­sider a deeper in­volve­ment in the Mid­dle East.</p>
    <p>A re­cently leaked draft treaty be­tween Iran and China, for in­stance, hinted at the pos­si­bil­ity of es­tab­lish­ing a Chi­nese naval base on the Ira­nian shores of the Gulf, in re­turn for an in­vest­ment that, al­legedly, could amount to</p>
    <p>US$400 bil­lion (S$549 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>Much of that draft treaty should not be taken too se­ri­ously; the in­vest­ment sums in­volved are an Ira­nian fan­tasy, and the idea that the Chi­nese will es­tab­lish a naval base in the ex­posed wa­ters of the Gulf that are dom­i­nated by the US Fifth Fleet is, of course, fan­ci­ful.</p>
    <p>It is also no­tice­able that while the Ira­nian au­thor­i­ties touted this sup­posed deal as “his­toric”, of­fi­cials in Bei­jing said very lit­tle.</p>
    <p>Still, the fact that sto­ries about deeper Chi­nese in­volve­ment in</p>
    <p>Iran co­in­cide with al­le­ga­tions of deeper Chi­nese in­volve­ment in Saudi Ara­bia’s nu­clear quest is in­ter­est­ing, and should be taken more se­ri­ously.</p>
    <p>For the fact re­mains that China has reached a level of de­vel­op­ment where it can be­gin to sup­ply top-notch mil­i­tary equip­ment to Mid­dle Eastern na­tions, as well as the nec­es­sary eco­nomic heft to act as a coun­ter­bal­ance to the United States. That is what it may al­ready be do­ing in Saudi Ara­bia.</p>
    <p>More than two decades ago, the US pre­vailed on Saudi Ara­bia to can­cel a con­tract to buy mis­siles from China. To­day, this can no longer be taken for granted: Mis­sile de­liv­ery sys­tems and drones are ar­eas in which the Chi­nese can com­pete with ev­ery­one in Mid­dle Eastern mar­kets.</p>
    <p>To be sure, such a deeper in­volve­ment also comes at a cost for China. Bei­jing will no longer be able to play the role of the “best friend” of ev­ery­one; it will have to make strate­gic choices.</p>
    <p>And it will also have to take risks, as other coun­tries in­volved in ei­ther the mil­i­tary or eco­nomic af­fairs in the re­gion reg­u­larly do.</p>
    <p>But it may be that China is now ready to as­sume th­ese risks, partly be­cause it sees it­self as a global power, partly be­cause it is al­ready forced to take sides as the US presses its key lo­cal al­lies such as Is­rael to re­ject Chi­nese ad­vances, but mainly be­cause Bei­jing can use its grow­ing Mid­dle East pres­ence as a coun­ter­weight in its broader con­fronta­tion with the US.</p>
    <p>Ei­ther way, if Mr Joe Bi­den ever hoped that, should he win the com­ing Amer­i­can pres­i­den­tial elec­tions, he may have a free hand in re­duc­ing US com­mit­ments to coun­tries such as Saudi Ara­bia, he is now cer­tain to dis­cover that this won’t be easy: The US will have to as­sume that any void it leaves be­hind in the Mid­dle East may be quickly taken up by China.</p>
    <p>And that is why so many peo­ple are keen to in­ves­ti­gate what may be go­ing on in the desert set­tle­ment of Al-Ula.</p>
