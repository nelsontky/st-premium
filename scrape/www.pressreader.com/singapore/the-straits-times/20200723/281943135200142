    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Face­book has placed an in­for­ma­tional dis­claimer on a post from US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump claim­ing mail-in vot­ing would lead to a “cor­rupt” US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The plat­form’s move on Tues­day, without re­mov­ing the post, fol­lows through on its pledge to step up ef­forts to fight mis­in­for­ma­tion, in­clud­ing from world lead­ers, shift­ing slightly from its hands-off policy on po­lit­i­cal speech.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump had writ­ten on his page that mail-in vot­ing, un­less changed by the courts, “will lead to the most COR­RUPT ELEC­TION in our Na­tion’s His­tory!”</p>
    <p>He added the hash­tag #RIGGEDELEC­TION.</p>
    <p>Face­book added an in­for­ma­tion tag that read: “Get of­fi­cial vot­ing info on how to vote in the 2020 US Elec­tion”. It in­cluded a link to the gov­ern­ment-spon­sored USA.gov page.</p>
    <p>Face­book has largely held firm to a policy that it will not factcheck po­lit­i­cal lead­ers, but it has pledged to take down posts which could lead to vi­o­lence or mis­lead peo­ple about the vot­ing process.</p>
    <p>It re­cently promised to add la­bels to posts which would nor­mally be re­moved for vi­o­lat­ing plat­form rules, but which are left on­line as they are “news­wor­thy”, fol­low­ing the ex­am­ple of Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>The la­bels have ap­peared on mes­sages from other elected of­fi­cials, in­clud­ing US Sen­a­tor Chuck Schumer, the Demo­cratic leader from New York.</p>
    <p>A coali­tion of ac­tivists has pressed Face­book to be more ag­gres­sive in re­mov­ing hate­ful con­tent and mis­in­for­ma­tion, in­clud­ing from the Pres­i­dent and po­lit­i­cal lead­ers. Some 1,000 ad­ver­tis­ers have joined a boy­cott aim­ing to ramp up pres­sure on Face­book.</p>
