    <p>The shock waves of civil­i­sa­tion travel through rocky ground and, at times, ric­o­chet around the globe, as ge­ol­o­gists know from decades of lis­ten­ing for earth­quakes with sen­si­tive seis­mome­ters. The hu­man pulses come from heavy traf­fic, foot­ball games, rock con­certs, fire­works, sub­ways, mine ex­plo­sions, rock drilling, fac­to­ries, jack­ham­mers, in­dus­trial blasts and other ac­tiv­i­ties. In 2001, vi­bra­tions from the col­lapse of the World Trade Cen­tre in New York reg­is­tered in five US states. Seis­mome­ters even picked up the im­pacts of the two air­planes.</p>
    <p>Now, a team of 76 sci­en­tists from more than two dozen coun­tries re­ports that lock­downs from the Covid-19 pan­demic led to a drop of up to 50 per cent in the global din tied to hu­mans. The main qui­et­ing, from March to May, was com­pared with lev­els in pre­vi­ous months and years.</p>
    <p>“The length and qui­es­cence of this pe­riod rep­re­sents the long­est and most co­her­ent global seis­mic noise re­duc­tion in recorded his­tory,” the sci­en­tists re­ported in the jour­nal Sci­ence. The qui­et­ing, they added, re­sulted from so­cial dis­tanc­ing, in­dus­trial shut­downs and drops in travel and tourism. The over­all de­cline far ex­ceeded the kind typ­i­cally ob­served on week­ends and hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>De­vices for mea­sur­ing earth­quakes go back at least to the early part of the 18th century, when pen­du­lums were used to dis­play ground mo­tions. In 1895, Ir­ish en­gi­neer John Milne es­tab­lished on the Isle of Wight a modern seis­mome­ter cen­tre that quickly grew into the world’s first global net­work, with 30 over­seas branches. By 1957, a global group of seis­mol­o­gists had listed 600 sta­tions. The de­vices can pick up vi­bra­tions not only from earth­quakes and hu­man ac­tiv­i­ties but also from hur­ri­canes and the crash­ing of ocean waves on shore­lines, as well as the im­pacts of rocky in­trud­ers from outer space.</p>
    <p>The new re­search was led by the Royal Ob­ser­va­tory of Bel­gium and other in­sti­tu­tions, in­clud­ing Im­pe­rial Col­lege Lon­don and the Univer­sity of Auck­land in New Zealand. Par­tic­i­pants from the United States in­cluded the seis­mo­log­i­cal lab­o­ra­tory in Al­bu­querque, New Mex­ico, of the US Ge­o­log­i­cal Sur­vey, as well as Prince­ton and Stan­ford uni­ver­si­ties and the uni­ver­si­ties of Alaska, Maine and Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>The team as­sem­bled data from 337 seis­mome­ters run by cit­i­zen sci­en­tists and 268 sta­tions run by gov­ern­ment, univer­sity and cor­po­rate ge­ol­o­gists. It re­ported that the global qui­et­ing be­gan in China in late Jan­uary and spread to Europe and the rest of the world in March and April. The team said that by the end of the mon­i­tor­ing pe­riod, in May, the vi­bra­tion lev­els in Bei­jing re­mained below those of pre­vi­ous years, sug­gest­ing that the pan­demic was still re­strict­ing ac­tiv­ity in the Chi­nese cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>In New York City’s Cen­tral Park, the vi­bra­tions on Sun­day nights dur­ing the peak lock­down pe­riod reg­is­tered as 10 per cent lower than pre­vi­ously mea­sured.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the great­est re­duc­tions were in big cities and other densely pop­u­lated ar­eas. The team said the qui­etude let sci­en­tists pick up pre­vi­ously hid­den earth­quake sig­nals and that con­tin­ued anal­y­sis of the data may help ge­ol­o­gists learn how to bet­ter dif­fer­en­ti­ate be­tween hu­man and nat­u­ral vi­bra­tions.</p>
    <p>The find­ings of the team were so sur­pris­ing and clear that they gen­er­ated news ac­counts in early April, al­most two months be­fore clo­sure of the mon­i­tor­ing win­dow.</p>
    <p>In its Sci­ence pa­per, the team re­ported that the qui­et­ing was also quite ev­i­dent at tourist spots. At the lush tropical isle of Bar­ba­dos in the Caribbean, the lock­down be­gan on March 28 and, com­pared with pre­vi­ous years, pro­duced a de­cline in ground vi­bra­tions of up to 50 per cent. The team found sim­i­lar re­duc­tions at ski re­sorts in Europe and the US.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, me­dian lev­els of shak­ing fell up to 50 per cent be­tween March and May, “high­light­ing how hu­man ac­tiv­i­ties im­pact the solid earth”, the au­thors wrote.</p>
