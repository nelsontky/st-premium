    <p>A for­mer man­ager of a Na­tional Li­brary Board (NLB) de­part­ment set up to spear­head its move into ebooks and other dig­i­tal re­sources has ad­mit­ted to graft of­fences in­volv­ing nearly $600,000.</p>
    <p>Ivan Koh Siong Wee, 50, had ob­tained the monies from a di­rec­tor of three firms, Low Pok Woen, 51, in ex­change for ad­vanc­ing the lat­ter’s busi­ness in­ter­ests with NLB.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, each man pleaded guilty to 20 counts of cor­rup­tion in­volv­ing nearly $500,000. An­other 36 sim­i­lar charges linked to the re­main­ing amount will be taken into con­sid­er­a­tion. The two Sin­ga­pore­ans com­mit­ted the of­fences be­tween 2005 and 2009.</p>
    <p>The court heard that be­sides work­ing as a man­ager at NLB’s Dig­i­tal Re­source Ser­vices De­part­ment, Koh also headed a com­pany known as Speed­cuts, which pro­vided hair-cut­ting ser­vices. Low was one of its em­ploy­ees be­tween 2001 and 2005.</p>
    <p>Deputy Public Pros­e­cu­tors Suhas Mal­ho­tra, Mag­da­lene Huang and An­dre Ong stated in court doc­u­ments that some time around 2004 or 2005, there was a “strate­gic move” within NLB to­wards dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>They added: “Dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion refers to main­tain­ing of in­for­ma­tive dig­i­tal data­bases, procur­ing of elec­tronic re­sources such as ebooks and e-comics and mi­cro­film­ing of old books. The dig­i­tal data­bases, e-books and e-comics maintained by NLB can be ac­cessed on­line by NLB mem­bers.”</p>
    <p>NLB’s Dig­i­tal Re­source Ser­vices De­part­ment was then formed to cham­pion this move. Koh had shared news about NLB’s move to­wards dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion with Low.</p>
    <p>He also said Low could ex­plore a busi­ness op­por­tu­nity in pro­vid­ing dig­i­tal con­tent to NLB.</p>
    <p>In Novem­ber 2005, Low in­cor­po­rated a firm known as Data­base Re­source Ser­vices to pro­vide this ser­vice to NLB. He later set up two more, JCD Cross­me­dia and W3.XS.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tors said that Koh was ap­pointed as a man­ager of NLB’s Dig­i­tal Re­source Ser­vices De­part­ment in 2005, making him the sec­ond in com­mand there.</p>
    <p>In Novem­ber that year, he started ask­ing Low for money for var­i­ous per­sonal pur­poses. Low then set aside about 30 per cent of all the prof­its earned from his three firms’ sub­scrip­tion con­tracts with NLB to be given as bribes to Koh.</p>
    <p>In re­turn, Koh helped ad­vance Low’s busi­ness in­ter­ests with NLB in var­i­ous ways. For in­stance, Koh shared con­fi­den­tial in­for­ma­tion with Low on the dig­i­tal re­sources that NLB was in­ter­ested in.</p>
    <p>The DPPs stated: “With this in­for­ma­tion, Low could... source the mar­ket se­lec­tively and sup­ply those re­sources to NLB when the op­por­tu­nity came.”</p>
    <p>Koh also ad­vised Low on what prices to quote NLB, the court heard.</p>
    <p>The of­fences came to light af­ter NLB lodged a po­lice re­port on Feb 21, 2014.</p>
    <p>Low and Koh were each of­fered bail of $80,000 yes­ter­day. Their cases have been ad­journed to Sept 15.</p>
