    <p>• Os­car-win­ner Kevin Spacey was ac­cused in a civil law­suit on Wed­nes­day of sex­ual as­sault in the 1980s by ac­tor An­thony Rapp and a sec­ond, un­named per­son when both plain­tiffs were about 14.</p>
    <p>The suit, filed in New York state court in Man­hat­tan, refers to the same al­leged in­ci­dent that Rapp, now 48, first re­counted in an Oc­to­ber 2017 Buz­zFeed in­ter­view that trig­gered Spacey’s fall from grace in Hol­ly­wood.</p>
    <p>Spacey, who won Os­cars for the films The Usual Sus­pects (1995) and Amer­i­can Beauty (1999), and a Golden Globe for the TV po­lit­i­cal drama House Of Cards (2013 to 2018), has largely re­treated from pub­lic life in the past three years.</p>
    <p>The ac­tor said in 2017 he did not re­mem­ber the en­counter Rapp de­scribed, but added: “If I did be­have then as he de­scribes, I owe him the sin­cer­est apol­ogy for what would have been deeply in­ap­pro­pri­ate drunken be­hav­iour.”</p>
    <p>Spacey, now 61, came out as gay in 2017.</p>
    <p>Rapp, best known for star­ring in the Broad­way mu­si­cal Rent, al­leged in the law­suit that Spacey “en­gaged in an un­wanted sex­ual ad­vance” with him when he was 14, dur­ing a party at Spacey’s home in 1986.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond per­son, iden­ti­fied only as C.D., al­leged that he and Spacey had en­gaged in sex­ual acts on sev­eral oc­ca­sions in the early 1980s when the plain­tiff was ap­prox­i­mately 14 years old.</p>
    <p>Both men are seek­ing un­spec­i­fied dam­ages for emo­tional dis­tress.</p>
    <p>Rapp’s ini­tial ac­cu­sa­tion, part of the #Me­Too move­ment against sex­ual mis­con­duct, led to Spacey be­ing dropped from House Of Cards and his scenes in the movie All The Money In The World (2017) were reshot with ac­tor Christo­pher Plum­mer.</p>
    <p>Prose­cu­tors in Mas­sachusetts last year dropped crim­i­nal charges against Spacey of felony in­de­cent as­sault and bat­tery in­volv­ing an 18-year-old man in a bar in 2016.</p>
    <p>Spacey had pleaded not guilty. The case was dropped af­ter the al­leged vic­tim de­clined to tes­tify.</p>
