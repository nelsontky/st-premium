    <p>(+166.74) July 21</p>
    <p>Local shares headed north yes­ter­day to re­verse Mon­day’s lack­lus­tre per­for­mance amid re­newed hopes for a virus vac­cine and op­ti­mism un­leashed by the his­toric Euro­pean Union stim­u­lus deal.</p>
    <p>Promis­ing news from clin­i­cal tri­als in Bri­tain al­lowed in­vestors here and across the re­gion to tem­po­rar­ily place fears of Covid-19 resur­gence and ex­tended lock­downs aside and push equities well into pos­i­tive ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>That good news was bol­stered by news that Euro­pean lead­ers had fi­nally clinched a €750 bil­lion (S$1.19 tril­lion) stim­u­lus deal.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times In­dex (STI) tracked overnight gains on Wall Street, which was boosted by a strong show­ing from tech­nol­ogy gi­ants, to add 0.5 per cent, or 13.15 points, to 2,629.45.</p>
    <p>Gainers out­num­bered losers 314 to 162 with 1.79 bil­lion shares worth $1.31 bil­lion chang­ing hands.</p>
    <p>OCBC In­vest­ment Re­search noted yes­ter­day: “Tech shares pushed the Nas­daq to a record closing high, as promis­ing trial re­sults from po­ten­tial Covid-19 vac­cines helped in­vestors look be­yond spi­ralling new cases of the dis­ease.”</p>
    <p>De­vel­oper giant City De­vel­op­ments emerged as the top per­former among the STI con­stituents, gain­ing 2.2 per cent to $8.50.</p>
    <p>The only three STI stocks that ended in the red were Hongkong Land, which fell 2 per cent, Dairy Farm In­ter­na­tional, 0.9 per cent lower, and Wil­mar In­ter­na­tional, off 0.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>Thai Bev­er­age and Sing­tel were the two most heav­ily traded STI stocks.</p>
    <p>Thai Bev­er­age closed flat at 66 cents af­ter around 46.8 mil­lion shares changed hands while Sing­tel ended the day up 0.4 per cent to $2.54, with more than 22.7 mil­lion shares traded.</p>
    <p>The STI’s per­for­mance was in line with re­gional bench­marks, which mostly ended higher on the back of im­proved sen­ti­ment stem­ming from the pos­si­ble virus vac­cine and the EU stim­u­lus deal.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s Hang Seng shot up 2.31 per cent while Shang­hai stocks added 0.2 per cent and the sec­ondary Shen­zhen bourse put on 0.72 per cent.</p>
    <p>Other re­gional markets fol­lowed suit: The Nikkei in Tokyo ad­vanced 0.73 per cent, the Kospi put on a ro­bust 1.39 per cent while the ASX in Aus­tralia re­sponded to the extension of local wage sup­port mea­sures and the EU bailout pack­age to rocket 2.58 per cent and hit its high­est close since March 9.</p>
    <p>The Aussie dol­lar was also a stand­out per­former and is on track for its best lev­els in a year against the United States green­back.</p>
