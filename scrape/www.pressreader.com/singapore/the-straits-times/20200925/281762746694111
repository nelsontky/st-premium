    <p>There were 15 new coronaviru­s cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,654. They in­cluded five im­ported cases – one Sin­ga­porean, one per­ma­nent res­i­dent, one work pass holder, one de­pen­dant’s pass holder and one longterm visit pass holder.</p>
    <p>Four of them – in­clud­ing the Sin­ga­porean who is a 44-year-old man – re­turned from In­dia, while the fifth im­ported case re­turned from In­done­sia. All of them were placed on stay-home no­tice upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>There were no new com­mu­nity cases an­nounced yes­ter­day. The last time there were no com­mu­nity cases was Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 10 new coronaviru­s pa­tients an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Among these, five were iden­ti­fied as con­tacts of pre­vi­ous cases and had al­ready been quar­an­tined to pre­vent fur­ther trans­mis­sion. They were tested dur­ing their quar­an­tine pe­riod, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing five cases were de­tected through sur­veil­lance test­ing, such as ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries ev­ery fort­night.</p>
    <p>No new clus­ters and no new lo­ca­tions vis­ited by in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients were an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>MOH said that the dor­mi­tory clus­ter at 15 Kaki Bukit Cres­cent has been closed as it has not had new cases linked to it for 28 days, or two in­cu­ba­tion pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of fewer than one case per day in the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of fewer than one case a day for the past fort­night.</p>
    <p>With 42 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,318 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease. A to­tal of 28 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, while 266 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. None is in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
