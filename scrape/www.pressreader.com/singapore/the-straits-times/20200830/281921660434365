    <p>NEW YORK • The Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion an­nounced a plan to con­vert some of its are­nas into polling places for the Novem­ber elec­tion as part of an agree­ment with its play­ers’ union to re­sume play-offs yes­ter­day, union and league of­fi­cials said in a joint statement.</p>
    <p>“We had a can­did, im­pas­sioned and pro­duc­tive con­ver­sa­tion yes­ter­day be­tween NBA play­ers, coaches and team gov­er­nors re­gard­ing next steps to fur­ther our col­lec­tive ef­forts and actions in sup­port of so­cial jus­tice and racial equal­ity,” said the statement on Friday signed by NBA com­mis­sioner Adam Sil­ver and the play­ers’ union ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Michele Roberts.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment came two days af­ter NBA play­ers staged a dra­matic work stop­page in re­sponse to the po­lice shoot­ing of Mr Ja­cob Blake, a black man, in Kenosha, Wis­con­sin.</p>
    <p>Ok­la­homa City Thun­der guard Chris Paul, the play­ers’ union pres­i­dent, said on Friday that he had never ex­pe­ri­enced any­thing like this in his 15 years in the league.</p>
    <p>He said: “We’re all tired of see­ing the same thing over and over again, and every­body just ex­pects us to be okay just be­cause we get paid great money.</p>
    <p>“You know, we’re hu­man. We have real feel­ings. And I’m glad that we got the chance to get in a room to­gether to talk with one an­other.”</p>
    <p>The plan to use are­nas as polling places ap­plies only where the are­nas are con­trolled by NBA team own­ers, who agreed to work with lo­cal of­fi­cials to make it hap­pen.</p>
    <p>In places where the dead­line to do so has passed, the own­ers plan to work with of­fi­cials to con­vert the are­nas, largely un­used amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, into out­lets for other elec­tion-re­lated ac­tiv­i­ties, such as voter reg­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Es­tab­lish­ing more polling lo­ca­tions was a key goal of More Than A Vote, the ini­tia­tive by Los An­ge­les Lak­ers su­per­star LeBron James and other ath­letes to pro­tect vot­ing rights and in­crease civic en­gage­ment, par­tic­u­larly among black peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Last month, the Mil­wau­kee Bucks of­fered Fis­erv Fo­rum arena as a polling lo­ca­tion, in part­ner­ship with the group led by James.</p>
    <p>Some NBA are­nas, such as TD Gar­den in Bos­ton, are not owned out­right by the NBA team that plays in it, whereas Madi­son Square Gar­den, for ex­am­ple, is owned by Mr James Dolan, owner of the New York Knicks.</p>
    <p>Some teams al­ready have their own plans un­der way.</p>
    <p>In June, the At­lanta Hawks an­nounced an ini­tia­tive in part­ner­ship with Ful­ton County to turn State Farm Arena in At­lanta into an early vot­ing polling lo­ca­tion from July 20 for a pri­mary run-off elec­tion, fol­low­ing a June pri­mary that was marred with prob­lems like ex­cep­tion­ally long lines.</p>
