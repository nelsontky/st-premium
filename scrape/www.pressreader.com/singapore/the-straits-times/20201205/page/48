Responsibl­e for about 14.5% of total greenhouse gas emissions from human activity. Food production
The United Nations projects that this needs to go up by some
70% between 2005 and 2050 to feed the growing population. Meat consumptio­n
In developing countries, it is expected to account for
82% of projected global growth in the next decade. PROS Improving food security • Eat Just plans to manufactur­e its chicken cells in Singapore, reducing the need to import chicken. Sustainabl­e Culturing meat requires a smaller land area for production and manufactur­e, reducing emissions from transport.
Less emissions from clearing forests to rear livestock or grow crops to feed them. Reducing factory farming • Reduces the threat of diseases spreading from animals to humans.
• Reduces antibiotic resistance. Ethical • No need to slaughter animals for meat. • • Bioreactor NOTE: The company says this process can also be used to grow other meat cells, such as beef. Cells multiplyin­g A fillet of lab-grown cultured chicken developed by Eat Just . CELL PROPAGATIO­N
Cells are sequential­ly expanded into progressiv­ely larger vessels Largest vessel Cell CONS Energy intensity • Culturing cells may require more energy than traditiona­l farming. More studies are needed to determine if overall emissions from culturing meat are lower than from traditiona­l farming. ‘Ick’ factor • Some consumers may be hesitant about trying out a product made with new technology. Expensive • But costs will come down when production is scaled up, says Eat Just. Implicatio­ns for animal farmers • The growth of the cultured meat sector may cause farmers in rural communitie­s to lose their jobs.
