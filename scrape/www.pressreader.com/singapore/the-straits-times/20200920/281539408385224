    <p>En­force­ment of­fi­cer John (not his real name for op­er­a­tional rea­sons) was shocked when he turned up at Hai Xian Lao restau­rant in Shaw House to con­duct an in­spec­tion on Aug 14.</p>
    <p>He never ex­pected that the safe dis­tanc­ing rules he was sup­posed to en­force would be used against him at the restau­rant.</p>
    <p>“The staff tried their best to de­lay our en­trance into the premises, say­ing the restau­rant was filled to ca­pac­ity and said they had to take our tem­per­a­tures be­fore we could en­ter,” said John, one of about 3,000 en­force­ment of­fi­cers, safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors and SG Clean am­bas­sadors de­ployed daily through­out the is­land to en­sure safe dis­tanc­ing rules are ad­hered to.</p>
    <p>As the restau­rant’s staff stalled for time, the en­force­ment of­fi­cers saw close to 30 cus­tomers ex­it­ing through the back door.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions re­vealed that the cus­tomers were seated in a locked pri­vate room in the restau­rant, which John said could hold only about 20 peo­ple com­fort­ably.</p>
    <p>“The staff knew they were in trou­ble but still ver­bally abused us, so we made it clear we had to call in the po­lice,” said John, 42, who is em­ployed by the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board.</p>
    <p>The hot­pot restau­rant was or­dered to close for 10 days and fined $2,000 for the of­fences, which in­cluded not main­tain­ing a 1m safe dis­tance be­tween groups of cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, John was in an­other en­force­ment blitz at about 11pm at Jiang Hu Xia Ke eatery in Or­chard Plaza, where he sensed some­thing was amiss with a ta­ble of four cus­tomers. The ta­ble had three teapots on it.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the co­pi­ous amount of tea the cus­tomers were sup­pos­edly drink­ing, the layer of con­den­sa­tion on the metal teapots made John sus­pi­cious since tea is usu­ally served hot, not cold.</p>
    <p>John’s team sought out t he eatery’s su­per­vi­sor, fol­low­ing their pro­to­col. It took “per­sis­tent ques­tion­ing” be­fore the su­per­vi­sor ad­mit­ted that beer had been served to cus­tomers af­ter 10.30pm, which is when the ban on the sale and con­sump­tion of al­co­hol kicks in un­der Covid-19 rules.</p>
    <p>A cus­tomer later feigned ig­no­rance of the teapot’s con­tents, a com­mon tac­tic that John has en­coun­tered when speak­ing with pa­trons who clearly knew they were flout­ing the rules.</p>
    <p>“It is very ob­vi­ous (that they know they are wrong). If they were un­aware of the rules, they would not be so re­sis­tant. They would not avoid our ques­tions or give il­log­i­cal an­swers,” said John.</p>
    <p>Like the Shaw House restau­rant, Jiang Hu Xia Ke eatery was or­dered to close for 10 days af­ter it was found that 13 cus­tomers were al­lowed to con­sume al­co­hol on its premises past the cur­few.</p>
    <p>John said thor­ough in­ves­ti­ga­tions are car­ried out be­fore penal­ties are im­posed.</p>
    <p>“There is no one-size-fits-all (way to) clos­ing cases and we need to en­sure al­leged of­fend­ers get a fair hear­ing,” he said, adding that of­ten, it was cus­tomers who were more un­rea­son­able and dif­fi­cult to man­age than staff.</p>
    <p>He said there could be in­stances where restau­rants tried their best to en­force the rules – like not ad­mit­ting groups larger than five – but ul­ti­mately, the staff would find a big group of friends seated to­gether, even though they were split across more than one ta­ble.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese (de­cep­tions) would be as­sessed ac­cord­ingly,” he said.</p>
