    <p>NEW YORK • Dou­ble-decker sight­see­ing buses car­ried fewer than 10 pas­sen­gers around Man­hat­tan on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Big fer­ries ar­rived at the Statue of Liberty with their lower decks nearly empty.</p>
    <p>Some of New York City’s largest ho­tels had few guests, while oth­ers were hous­ing home­less men who had been cleared out of shel­ters to curb the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has trig­gered a free-fall in tourism to New York City, one of the world’s most pop­u­lar des­ti­na­tions.</p>
    <p>A new fore­cast pre­dicts that the in­flux of tourists will not fully re­bound for at least four years, a som­bre as­sess­ment that re­flects one of the big­gest chal­lenges to the Amer­i­can city’s re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>The surge in tourism in re­cent years has been a vi­tal pil­lar of the city’s econ­omy, sup­port­ing hun­dreds of thou­sands of work­ers across a range of in­dus­tries, from ho­tels to restau­rants to Broad­way.</p>
    <p>New York City drew a record 66.6 mil­lion vis­i­tors last year and was on pace for even more this year, a fore­cast re­leased on Mon­day by the city’s tourism pro­mo­tion agency, NYC & Co, shows.</p>
    <p>Now the city is likely to reach just one-third of last year’s to­tal.</p>
    <p>The col­lapse of tourism has been a key rea­son that New York’s econ­omy has been hit harder than most other ma­jor US cities.</p>
    <p>Hun­dreds of restau­rants, many of which rely on out-of-town vis­i­tors, and sev­eral large ho­tels have closed for good.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the shut­down in March, the hos­pi­tal­ity in­dus­try pro­vided as many as 400,000 jobs and drew US$46 bil­lion (S$62 bil­lion) in an­nual spend­ing. Seven months later, at the end of Oc­to­ber, more than 1.3 mil­lion res­i­dents were col­lect­ing un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>The city’s un­em­ploy­ment rate is 14.1 per cent, more than dou­ble the na­tional rate.</p>
    <p>The chal­lenge of lur­ing vis­i­tors back to New York in sig­nif­i­cant num­bers could be­come even greater with the virus surg­ing again. The num­ber of daily cases in the city has sur­passed 1,000 for the first time since the spring.</p>
    <p>Even when the pan­demic ends, the re­turn of in­ter­na­tional vis­i­tors, who stay longer and spend much more than do­mes­tic vis­i­tors, is likely to be slug­gish. The num­ber of for­eign tourists in the city is not</p>
    <p>likely to re­turn to its 2019 level be­fore 2025, the fore­cast shows.</p>
    <p>“It’s go­ing to be a very slow build ini­tially,” said Mr Fred Dixon, chief ex­ec­u­tive of NYC & Co.</p>
    <p>The re­vival will de­pend on the dis­tri­bu­tion of an ef­fec­tive vac­cine, Mr Dixon said, which pub­lic health of­fi­cials have said is not likely to hap­pen un­til late spring or early sum­mer.</p>
    <p>Un­til then, the flow of vis­i­tors will re­main at a trickle, he added, au­gur­ing a dif­fi­cult winter for many busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>The loss of tourism has been es­pe­cially acute for less-ed­u­cated work­ers, said Mr James Par­rott, di­rec­tor of eco­nomic and fis­cal pol­icy at the Cen­tre for New York Af­fairs.</p>
    <p>The hos­pi­tal­ity in­dus­try added 130,000 jobs in 10 years be­fore the pan­demic, mak­ing it the largest em­ployer of less-ed­u­cated work­ers in the city, he said. “The tourism boom in re­cent years meant that thou­sands of New York­ers with­out a col­lege de­gree saw sub­stan­tial real pay in­creases,” he said.</p>
    <p>Leisure and busi­ness travel skid­ded to a stand­still in mid-March</p>
    <p>and has been on hold since then.</p>
    <p>NYC & Co es­ti­mates that 12 mil­lion peo­ple vis­ited the city this year be­fore the shut­down, but the to­tal in the en­su­ing nine months may only reach 10 mil­lion, a fig­ure that in­cludes all es­sen­tial work­ers who ar­rived in re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus crisis.</p>
    <p>More than 60 ho­tels have be­come tem­po­rary homes to roughly 9,500 home­less peo­ple who were moved out of crowded shel­ters to pre­vent the spread of the virus. The US$120 a night per room the city pays ho­tels that have taken in home­less peo­ple has pro­vided badly needed financial re­lief.</p>
    <p>The dis­ap­pear­ance of vis­i­tors has rav­aged busi­nesses like TopView Sight­see­ing, which or­gan­ises bus tours of the city.</p>
    <p>Over­all busi­ness has dropped more than 90 per cent since be­fore March, said Mr Jonathan Hen­gal, se­nior di­rec­tor of sales and op­er­a­tions. Be­fore the pan­demic, tours would hold more than 80 peo­ple – of­ten reach­ing full ca­pac­ity at 89.</p>
    <p>Now, 35 peo­ple might show up on the most crowded week­end</p>
    <p>days, while on a Mon­day af­ter­noon num­bers could fall to be­low 10, Mr Hen­gal said.</p>
    <p>“It’s been dev­as­tat­ing,” he said. “And we don’t know where this is go­ing. Ev­ery­thing’s been in­cred­i­bly un­cer­tain.”</p>
    <p>At Duffy Square at the north­ern edge of Times Square, Ms Siria Hi­dalgo was tak­ing pho­tos with her boyfriend, Mr Luis Mi­randa, 32. The cou­ple ar­rived in New York on Sun­day from Pue­bla, Mex­ico.</p>
    <p>Ms Hi­dalgo, 33, said the com­bi­na­tion of low air­fares and pleas­ant late au­tumn weather lured them to the city. “Once the weather gets colder and if things get even worse, it’s go­ing to be even harder to travel. So we wanted to still come while we can,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Broad­way has re­peat­edly ex­tended the length of time it will re­main closed.</p>
    <p>The ear­li­est the­atres are ex­pected to open is May 30. “Many look at Broad­way as the din­ner bell,” Mr Dixon said. “As soon as that din­ner bell rings, peo­ple are go­ing to come far and wide.”</p>
    <p>Be­fore the shut­down in March, the hos­pi­tal­ity in­dus­try pro­vided as many as 400,000 jobs and drew US$46 bil­lion (S$62 bil­lion) in an­nual spend­ing. Seven months later, at the end of Oc­to­ber, more than 1.3 mil­lion res­i­dents were col­lect­ing un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits.</p>
