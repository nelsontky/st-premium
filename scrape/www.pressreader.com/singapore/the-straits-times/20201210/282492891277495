    <p>PRES­NEL KIM­PEMBE PSG DE­FENDER, dur­ing their Cham­pi­ons League match, af­ter claims the fourth of­fi­cial used a racist term against Basak­se­hir’s as­sis­tant coach</p>
    <p>PARIS • Paris Saint-Ger­main’s Cham­pi­ons League game with Is­tan­bul Basak­se­hir was sus­pended on Tues­day and was due to be com­pleted yes­ter­day af­ter both sets of play­ers walked off in protest amid al­le­ga­tions of racism by one of the match of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>The row erupted af­ter Basak­se­hir as­sis­tant coach Pierre Webo, the former Cameroon i nter­na­tional, was shown a red card dur­ing a fierce row on the touch­line and staff from the Turk­ish club ac­cused the fourth of­fi­cial, Se­bas­tian Coltescu, of us­ing a racist term.</p>
    <p>That led to the game at the Parc des Princes stop­ping in the 14th minute while still goal-less, with the play­ers walk­ing off around 10 min­utes later.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean foot­ball gov­ern­ing body Uefa said yes­ter­day it has opened a dis­ci­plinary pro­ceed­ing into the match, which was set to restart yes­ter­day with a dif­fer­ent set of of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>Tele­vi­sion mi­cro­phones picked up a fu­ri­ous Webo re­peat­edly ask­ing why a racist term had been used to de­scribe him.</p>
    <p>The ref­eree, Ovidiu Hate­gan, his two as­sis­tants and fourth of­fi­cial Coltescu were all from Ro­ma­nia.</p>
    <p>In the ex­change in ques­tion, heard on tele­vi­sion and trans­lated by an AFP jour­nal­ist, Coltescu said: “The black one over there. This is not pos­si­ble. Go and iden­tify him. That guy, the black one, it’s not pos­si­ble to act like that.”</p>
    <p>This was in re­sponse to Webo ve­he­mently protest­ing against a ref­er­ee­ing de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>Basak­se­hir’s Sene­gal in­ter­na­tional striker Demba Ba, among the sub­sti­tutes for the away side, could be clearly heard on tele­vi­sion re­mon­strat­ing with the of­fi­cial, say­ing in English: “When you men­tion a white guy, you never say ‘this white guy’, you just say ‘this guy’, so why when you men­tion a black guy you say ‘this black guy’?”</p>
    <p>TV footage also showed PSG’s French de­fender Pres­nel Kim­pembe say­ing: “Is he se­ri­ous? We are head­ing in. We’re head­ing in. That’s it, we’re head­ing in.”</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent sparked a re­ac­tion from Turkey’s Pres­i­dent Re­cep Tayyip Er­do­gan, who is un­der­stood to be closely linked to the own­ers of the club.</p>
    <p>He tweeted to say: “I strongly con­demn the racist re­marks made to Pierre Webo, mem­ber of the Basak­se­hir tech­ni­cal staff, and am con­vinced Uefa will take the nec­es­sary mea­sures.”</p>
    <p>He said the in­ci­dent was a fresh ex­pres­sion of racist trends in France. “This ap­proach is un­for­giv­able. Our deter­mined stance will con­tinue.</p>
    <p>“(...) France has be­come a coun­try where racist rhetoric, ac­tions are in­ten­si­fied,” he told a news con­fer­ence in Ankara.</p>
    <p>France’s sports min­is­ter Rox­ana Maracinean­u, who was born in Ro­ma­nia, praised the play­ers’ “his­toric de­ci­sion”.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Gok­sel Gu­mus­dag, the pres­i­dent of the Turk­ish cham­pi­ons, said his side re­fused to restart the game as long as the fourth of­fi­cial was still in­volved.</p>
    <p>Basak­se­hir re­sponded to the in­ci­dents by tweet­ing “NO TO RACISM #Re­spect”, along with a photo of Uefa’s anti-racism logo.</p>
    <p>The mes­sage was retweeted by PSG, who them­selves later tweeted their sup­port on their English-lan­guage feed.</p>
    <p>De­spite the in­ter­rup­tion, PSG qual­i­fied for the last 16 from Group H af­ter RB Leipzig beat Manch­ester United 3-2 in Ger­many.</p>
