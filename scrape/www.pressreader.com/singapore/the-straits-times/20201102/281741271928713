    <p>LYON • An at­tacker armed with a sawn-off shot­gun se­ri­ously wounded a Greek Or­tho­dox priest in a shoot­ing out­side a church in the French city of Lyon last Satur­day, with the coun­try still reel­ing from a deadly church at­tack just days ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Mr Niko­laos Kakave­laki, 52, is now in a se­ri­ous con­di­tion in hos­pi­tal, a po­lice source said.</p>
    <p>The at­tacker fled the scene but Lyon’s public pros­e­cu­tor later said a sus­pect had been ar­rested.</p>
    <p>“A per­son who could cor­re­spond to the de­scrip­tion given by the ini­tial wit­nesses has been placed in pol­icy cus­tody,” pros­e­cu­tor Ni­co­las Jac­quet said.</p>
    <p>The Lyon pros­e­cu­tor’s of­fice said wit­nesses heard gun­shots, then “saw an in­di­vid­ual flee­ing and dis­cov­ered a man with gun­shot wounds at the back door of the church”.</p>
    <p>The priest was shot twice in the chest at point-blank range, ac­cord­ing to sources close to the in­quiry. The mo­tive was not clear. It comes at a time when France is al­ready on edge af­ter the killing of three peo­ple in a church in Nice last Thurs­day and the be­head­ing last month of a teacher who had shown his class a car­toon of Prophet Muham­mad.</p>
    <p>In the church at­tack in Nice, a 21-year-old Tu­nisian sus­pect was shot by po­lice and is now in crit­i­cal con­di­tion af­ter the knife ram­page that left three peo­ple dead.</p>
    <p>Two more men were ar­rested last Satur­day in con­nec­tion with the at­tack, bring­ing the num­ber of peo­ple in cus­tody to six as in­ves­ti­ga­tors trace the sus­pect’s con­tacts.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the pri­mary sus­pect in the trial over the 2015 Char­lie Hebdo mas­sacre tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 and the court has been sus­pended un­til Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Ali Riza Po­lat, 35, is ac­cused of hav­ing helped the killers of 12 peo­ple in the at­tack on satir­i­cal weekly Char­lie Hebdo, a fe­male po­lice of­fi­cer a day later and four hostages at a Jewish su­per­mar­ket.</p>
    <p>He faces life in jail if con­victed. Po­lat vom­ited and was seen by a doc­tor, prompt­ing the judge to sus­pend the court. The 10 ac­cused ac­com­plices must now be tested and the re­sump­tion of the trial will de­pend on the test re­sults.</p>
