    <p>PETALING JAYA • A Malaysian flight at­ten­dant caught smug­gling heroin in her un­der­gar­ments last year has been put be­hind bars in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian County Court on Thurs­day sen­tenced Zailee Zainal to nine years and six months in jail.</p>
    <p>The 40-year-old mother of three will be el­i­gi­ble for pa­role af­ter serv­ing three years.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Aus­tralian me­dia, County Court Judge Michael Cahill said Zailee de­served to be shown some le­niency, as she was in des­per­ate need of funds to foot her daughter’s mount­ing med­i­cal bills.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian Bor­der Force nabbed Zailee last year, af­ter heroin was found hid­den in her bra and un­der­wear.</p>
    <p>The court heard that she was of­fered A$6,500 (S$6,330) to smug­gle heroin with a street value of about A$3 mil­lion into Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Be­tween Oc­to­ber 2018 and Jan­uary 2019, the ste­wardess made eight trips to Aus­tralia, smug­gling more than 4kg of heroin in to­tal.</p>
    <p>Judge Cahill said Zailee was des­per­ate to raise money to pay for her daughter’s oper­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“There is a place for the ex­er­cise of mercy in sen­tenc­ing. You felt that you had no other op­tion other than to com­mit a crime,” the judge was quoted as say­ing.</p>
    <p>The ac­cused was “pro­foundly re­morse­ful” and had writ­ten a let­ter of apol­ogy, he noted. “You are very un­likely to re­of­fend,” ABC News quoted the judge as say­ing.</p>
    <p>Zailee, who worked for Malindo Air, was re­cruited by a drug syn­di­cate when the gang dis­cov­ered that she was des­per­ate for money.</p>
    <p>The court was told that Zailee had re­sorted to sell­ing brown­ies and Tup­per­ware to make ends meet af­ter draw­ing down on her mort­gage.</p>
    <p>Af­ter ex­haust­ing all other av­enues to raise the money needed, she had re­quested the air­line com­pany to can­vas for dona­tions on her be­half.</p>
    <p>An ac­quain­tance, who was privy to the e-mail she sent, then ap­proached her and of­fered the job as a drug car­rier.</p>
    <p>“I was vul­ner­a­ble and at the time, will­ing to do any­thing,” Zailee had said in her de­fence. The court heard that Zailee had un­der­gone train­ing for the role, in­clud­ing learning how to talk in code and walk­ing con­fi­dently with a pack­age be­tween one’s legs.</p>
