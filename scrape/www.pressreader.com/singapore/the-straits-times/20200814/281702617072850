    <p>The case cen­tres on the role lawyer Lee Suet Fern played in the prepa­ra­tion and ex­e­cu­tion of the last will of found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew, her fa­ther-in-law.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary last year, the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers com­plained to the Law So­ci­ety about pos­si­ble pro­fes­sional mis­con­duct over the mat­ter. Deputy At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Lionel Yee fur­ther asked that the case be re­ferred to a dis­ci­plinary tri­bunal.</p>
    <p>Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon ap­pointed a two-man tri­bunal, com­pris­ing Se­nior Coun­sel Sar­jit Singh Gill and lawyer Leon Yee Kee Shian. After hear­ing from lawyers on both sides, the tri­bunal in Fe­bru­ary this year found Mrs Lee guilty of grossly im­proper pro­fes­sional con­duct.</p>
    <p>As the wife of Mr Lee Hsien Yang – the younger son of the found­ing prime min­is­ter – Mrs Lee should have known there was a con­flict of in­ter­est in her han­dling of the will, signed on Dec 17, 2013, the tri­bunal said.</p>
    <p>It also said the facts ex­posed an “un­savoury tale” of how she and her hus­band had mis­led the se­nior Mr Lee to sign a new will with­out the ad­vice of his usual lawyer, Ms Kwa Kim Li, who had pre­pared all six of his pre­vi­ous wills. The se­nior Mr Lee was then aged 90 and in poor health. He died on March 23, 2015, at the age of 91.</p>
    <p>His last will dif­fered from the one be­fore and did not con­tain some changes he had wanted and dis­cussed with Ms Kwa four days ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Among the dif­fer­ences is a de­mo­li­tion clause – re­lat­ing to the de­mo­li­tion of his 38 Ox­ley Road house after his death – which had not been in the sixth or penul­ti­mate will but was in the last.</p>
    <p>The share of the es­tate be­queathed to each of his three chil­dren was also dif­fer­ent, with Dr Lee Wei Ling, Mr Lee Hsien Yang and their el­der brother, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong, given equal shares. In the sixth will, Dr Lee was to re­ceive a big­ger share.</p>
    <p>The tri­bunal found Mrs Lee had told her fa­ther-in-law that the draft last will was the same as the first will he had ex­e­cuted in 2011, which was un­true. She also did not ad­vise him on the dif­fer­ences be­tween the draft last will and the sixth will.</p>
    <p>In its 206-page re­port re­leased in Fe­bru­ary, it de­scribed Mrs Lee as a “de­ceit­ful wit­ness, who tai­lored her ev­i­dence to por­tray her­self as an in­no­cent vic­tim who had been ma­ligned”, ad­ding that her hus­band’s con­duct was “equally de­ceit­ful”.</p>
