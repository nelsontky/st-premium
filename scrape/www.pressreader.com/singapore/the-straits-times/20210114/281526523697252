        <p>Malaysia yes­ter­day reim­posed the move­ment con­trol or­der (MCO) for the first time since March. With the num­ber of ac­tive coro­n­avirus cases now greater than the num­ber of beds re­served for Covid-19 pa­tients in public hos­pi­tals and quar­an­tine cen­tres, some are ques­tion­ing whether the two-week MCO has come too late.</p>
        <p>On Dec 5, de­spite hav­ing recorded more than 1,000 new Covid-19 cases daily for most of the past month and over 100 deaths in the same pe­riod, Malaysia de­cided it would al­low in­ter­state travel two days later.</p>
        <p>That led to year-end hol­i­day­mak­ers flock­ing to pop­u­lar spots such as Pe­nang and Langkawi, which, pre­dictably, reg­is­tered a spike in cases.</p>
        <p>Since then, daily in­fec­tions in the coun­try have av­er­aged close to 2,000, with a record high of 3,309 on Tues­day.</p>
        <p>As at Tues­day, the to­tal num­ber of ac­tive cases has tripled to 31,849, which is more than the 28,674 beds re­served for Covid-19 pa­tients in public hos­pi­tals and quar­an­tine cen­tres.</p>
        <p>With the Health Min­istry left with no choice but to trust those with mild symp­toms to prac­tise self-iso­la­tion at home – al­beit with the risk of them trans­mit­ting the coro­n­avirus to fam­ily mem­bers and neigh­bours – the re­turn of the strict move­ment con­trol or­der (MCO), first in­tro­duced last March, was in­evitable.</p>
        <p>Di­rec­tor-Gen­eral of Health Noor Hisham Ab­dul­lah warned last week that, based on ex­ist­ing trends, daily cases could hit 8,000 by mid-March and breach the five­fig­ure mark in April.</p>
        <p>But ques­tions abound over whether the two-week MCO, which be­gan yes­ter­day in five states and all three fed­eral ter­ri­to­ries, has come too late.</p>
        <p>“In my opin­ion, it would have been best to im­pose an MCO on Sabah af­ter the rapid rise in cases due to the state elec­tion in Septem­ber, but be­cause there was no MCO, the cases have dragged on and on,” Pro­fes­sor Awang Bulgiba Awang Mah­mud, chair­man of the Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and In­no­va­tion Min­istry’s Covid-19 Epi­demi­o­log­i­cal Anal­y­sis and Strate­gies Task Force, told The Straits Times.</p>
        <p>In Klang Val­ley – the epi­cen­tre of the cri­sis – in­ten­sive care units (ICUs) for Covid-19 pa­tients at sev­eral hos­pi­tals are full, mean­ing doc­tors will have to make “live-or-die” de­ci­sions for those crit­i­cally ill.</p>
        <p>The Sun­gai Bu­loh Hos­pi­tal, the main treat­ment cen­tre for cases in Klang Val­ley, has been open­ing up new ICU wards every week.</p>
        <p>“Even cases need­ing ven­ti­la­tors in ICU are forced to be man­aged in emer­gency zones,” said Dr Alza­mani Mo­ham­mad Idrose, an emer­gency and trauma spe­cial­ist.</p>
        <p>Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham said the gov­ern­ment is seek­ing to add man­power, with­out which it can­not add more beds. The in­creas­ing strain has re­sulted in no zero-death days since Dec 4, with a record 16 fa­tal­i­ties on Jan 8. Some 431 have died since Sep 12 – the day cam­paign­ing for the snap Sabah state polls be­gan – com­pared with just 128 in the pre­vi­ous nine months.</p>
        <p>The poll was trig­gered af­ter Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s Perikatan Na­sional (PN) pact tried to oust Parti Warisan Sabah pres­i­dent Shafie Ap­dal as chief min­is­ter.</p>
        <p>The elec­tion went ahead de­spite new clus­ters mush­room­ing in the east­ern coast of Sabah, which the au­thor­i­ties claimed were caused by il­le­gal mi­grants en­ter­ing through the por­ous seaboard.</p>
        <p>But as politi­cians and vot­ers shut­tled in and out of the state, Covid-19 soon took root na­tion­wide.</p>
        <p>While both sides of the po­lit­i­cal di­vide pointed the fin­ger at each other for forc­ing Saba­hans to the</p>
        <p>bal­lot box, public con­fi­dence in the gov­ern­ment’s abil­ity to han­dle the pro­longed out­break wa­vered.</p>
        <p>Opin­ion polls car­ried out in July and Au­gust last year saw a whop­ping 93 per cent of re­spon­dents ap­prov­ing of the gov­ern­ment’s han­dling of the pan­demic. By Oc­to­ber, it slipped to 63 per cent.</p>
        <p>Ques­tions have since been raised – many of them loudly and an­grily – about loose pro­to­cols as in­fec­tions re­peat­edly hit new highs, with some even sug­gest­ing that the lift­ing of in­ter­state travel was a ploy to al­low the Muhyid­din ad­min­is­tra­tion to seek emer­gency pow­ers and sus­pend Par­lia­ment amid grow­ing doubts over PN’s al­ready shaky grip on power.</p>
        <p>“Wait. Did they pur­posely al­low in­ter­state travel be­fore so the cases would spike thus mak­ing it eas­ier for PM8 (Muhyid­din) to ask for Daru­rat (emer­gency) dec­la­ra­tion from Agong (King)?” said Twit­ter user nizam­bak­eri in a tweet that has been shared 3,000 times.</p>
        <p>But Malaysians also need to look at them­selves in the mir­ror.</p>
        <p>It is true that politi­cians and other prom­i­nent mem­bers of so­ci­ety flouted the rules meant to re­duce the risk of trans­mis­sion but largely got away with a slap on the wrist.</p>
        <p>How­ever, the num­ber of peo­ple caught in breach of the same rules – such as fail­ing to wear masks or par­tic­i­pat­ing in pro­hib­ited en­ter­tain­ment ac­tiv­i­ties – has also been on the in­crease.</p>
        <p>Some 3,304 were de­tained by the po­lice in the first week this year, com­pared with 2,974 (not in­clud­ing those caught cross­ing district or state bor­ders) from Nov 9 to 15, the first week the con­di­tional MCO was put in place in most states. This lack­adaisi­cal at­ti­tude by some en­dan­gers oth­ers, and ex­perts be­lieve that an MCO of be­tween six and 12 weeks will be needed to bring Covid-19 back un­der con­trol.</p>
        <p>“The MCO needs to be strict enough and long enough for it to work. A half-baked MCO will have no real ef­fects on the con­tact rate,” said Prof Awang Bulgiba.</p>
        <p>“The first time around, with MCO 1.0, we bought time, but squan­dered it and did not ad­dress many is­sues... If we do not do some­thing about these is­sues, then the time we are buy­ing with MCO 2.0 will be squan­dered again.”</p>
