    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and his doc­tors over the week­end struck an up­beat tone though it was marred by seem­ingly con­flict­ing sig­nals about his con­di­tion, with Mr Trump even mak­ing a sur­prise out­ing to greet sup­port­ers out­side the hos­pi­tal where he is be­ing treated for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s med­i­cal team was still op­ti­mistic that he would be able to re­turn to the White House yes­ter­day, and would make the de­ci­sion later in the day, his chief of staff Mark Mead­ows told Fox News.</p>
    <p>Mr Mead­ows added that the Pres­i­dent’s con­di­tion had im­proved overnight and he was ready to get back to a nor­mal work­ing sched­ule.</p>
    <p>Mar­kets yes­ter­day opened higher and rose af­ter Mr Mead­ows’ com­ments, with the Dow Jones In­dus­trial Av­er­age up 370 points, the Nas­daq Com­pos­ite 170 points higher, and the S&P 500 adding 45 points.</p>
    <p>But ob­servers were con­cerned by White House physi­cian Sean Con­ley’s an­nounce­ment at a press con­fer­ence on Sun­day that the Pres­i­dent had been ad­min­is­tered oxy­gen af­ter two episodes of tran­sient drops in oxy­gen sat­u­ra­tion, some­thing Dr Con­ley had not men­tioned the day be­fore de­spite be­ing di­rectly asked about it.</p>
    <p>Med­i­cal ex­perts were also con­cerned by Dr Con­ley’s news that Mr Trump was be­ing treated with dex­am­etha­sone, a steroid meant for se­verely ill and crit­i­cal pa­tients, and pointed out that its pos­si­ble side ef­fects in­clude mood swings.</p>
    <p>They were also not re­as­sured by Mr Trump’s string of Twit­ter posts yes­ter­day morn­ing, a se­ries of 18 tweets be­fore 8am urg­ing peo­ple to vote for him and his plat­form.</p>
    <p>In one ex­am­ple, he said: “FIGHT THE COR­RUPT FAKE NEWS ME­DIA. VOTE!”</p>
    <p>But the ac­tiv­ity was in line with Mr Trump’s drive all through the week­end to project a show of strength, cul­mi­nat­ing in an evening ex­cur­sion to greet sup­port­ers out­side the Wal­ter Reed Na­tional Mil­i­tary Med­i­cal Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>“We have en­thu­si­asm like prob­a­bly no­body’s ever had,” said Mr Trump in a video mes­sage on Twit­ter, hours af­ter the re­lease of a Reuters-Ip­sos poll show­ing his Demo­cratic ri­val Joe Bi­den’s lead over him had widened. “We have more en­thu­si­asm than maybe any­body.”</p>
    <p>He also sought to show he was tak­ing the coro­n­avirus sit­u­a­tion se­ri­ously and had a han­dle on the sit­u­a­tion, say­ing: “I learned a lot about Covid, I learned it by re­ally go­ing to school. This is the real school. This</p>
    <p>isn’t the let’s read the books school. I get it and I un­der­stand it.”</p>
    <p>Wear­ing a face mask and a suit jacket, the Pres­i­dent rode in an ar­moured SUV, wav­ing to cheer­ing sup­port­ers dis­play­ing US and Trump cam­paign flags out­side the hos­pi­tal grounds.</p>
    <p>But the out­ing, at odds with med­i­cal ex­perts’ ad­vice for Covid-19 pos­i­tive pa­tients to re­main iso­lated, was crit­i­cised as ir­re­spon­si­ble and en­dan­ger­ing his driver and the Se­cret Ser­vice mem­bers who rode with him in the small air­tight space.</p>
    <p>Dr James Phillips, an at­tend­ing physi­cian at the Wal­ter Reed med­i­cal cen­tre, said that be­cause the pres­i­den­tial ve­hi­cle was sealed against chem­i­cal at­tack, “the risk of Covid-19 trans­mis­sion in­side is as high as it gets out­side of med­i­cal pro­ce­dures”.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery sin­gle per­son in the ve­hi­cle dur­ing that com­pletely un­nec­es­sary Pres­i­den­tial ‘drive-by’ just now has to be quar­an­tined for 14 days. They might get sick. They may die. For po­lit­i­cal the­atre. Com­manded by Trump to put their lives at risk for the­atre. This is in­san­ity,” Dr Phillips, who is chief of dis­as­ter medicine at Ge­orge Washington Univer­sity, wrote on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, First Lady Me­la­nia Trump, who had also tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus, said she was feel­ing good and would con­tinue to rest in the White House.</p>
    <p>“My fam­ily is grate­ful for all of the pray­ers and sup­port,” she wrote on Twit­ter yes­ter­day. “Thank you to med­i­cal staff and care­tak­ers ev­ery­where, and my con­tin­ued pray­ers for those who are ill or have a fam­ily mem­ber im­pacted by the virus.”</p>
    <p>Separately, White House press sec­re­tary Kayleigh McE­nany said that she had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 yes­ter­day while “ex­pe­ri­enc­ing no symp­toms”.</p>
    <p>“With my re­cent pos­i­tive test, I will be­gin the quar­an­tine process and will con­tinue work­ing on be­half of the Amer­i­can Peo­ple re­motely,” she tweeted.</p>
    <p>“No re­porters, pro­duc­ers, or mem­bers of the press are listed as close con­tacts by the White House Med­i­cal Unit,” she added.</p>
    <p>Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence and his wife Karen Pence again tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19 yes­ter­day, an ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>Mr Pence was due to travel yes­ter­day to Salt Lake City, Utah, where he is sched­uled to hold the vi­cepres­i­den­tial de­bate with Mr Bi­den’s run­ning mate, Se­na­tor Ka­mala Har­ris, to­mor­row.</p>
