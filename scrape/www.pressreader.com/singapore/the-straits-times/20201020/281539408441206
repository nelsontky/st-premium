    <p>The ru­ral-ur­ban di­vide in China has re­mained wide de­spite years of poli­cies to nar­row the gap. China needs to deal more ef­fec­tively with this di­vide to re­alise its dream of a re­ju­ve­nated na­tion, says global af­fairs cor­re­spon­dent Goh Sui Noi (be­low).</p>
    <p>Since March, thou­sands of farm­ers in China’s Shan­dong prov­ince have had their homes de­mol­ished at short no­tice un­der a plan to move them into new, mod­ern homes.</p>
    <p>Those who re­fused to sign agree­ments for the de­mo­li­tion were de­tained. The de­mo­li­tion took place be­fore re­lo­ca­tion, so peo­ple were forced to look for their own tem­po­rary hous­ing while their houses were be­ing built. Some of the dis­placed with nowhere else to go built makeshift hous­ing on the edge of their fields.</p>
    <p>The Shan­dong case is an ex­treme ex­am­ple of what has been go­ing on un­der var­i­ous poli­cies to mod­ernise China’s ru­ral ar­eas – which in­clude build­ing new, larger, planned com­mu­ni­ties for farm­ers so that pub­lic goods can be de­liv­ered to them more ef­fi­ciently while free­ing up more land for farm­ing and other uses – but which have ad­verse con­se­quences.</p>
    <p>As com­pen­sa­tion for their de­mol­ished homes tends to be low and the new homes are ex­pen­sive, farm­ers of­ten in­cur huge debts for smaller homes in multi-storey build­ings that have no space for their farm tools. Some find them­selves moved to com­mu­ni­ties so far away from their farms that they have to give up farm­ing al­to­gether and look for jobs else­where, or if they are aged, de­pend on their small pensions and re­mit­tances from their chil­dren work­ing in the cities.</p>
    <p>The woes of the Shan­dong farm­ers are in­dica­tive of prob­lems in the coun­try­side that decades of ef­forts to re­solve have pro­duced less than de­sired results.</p>
    <p>In the last 17 years, the san­nong wenti, or the three ru­ral is­sues of agri­cul­tural pro­duc­tion, ru­ral de­vel­op­ment and farm­ers’ in­come, have been the sub­ject of the gov­ern­ment’s “No. 1 Cen­tral Doc­u­ment”, sig­nalling their im­por­tance. That ru­ral is­sues have been the top pri­or­ity of the gov­ern­ment for 17 years in a row shows how in­tractable they are and, sug­gest some, how the gov­ern­ment’s poli­cies have fallen short.</p>
    <p>In the past 40 decades, China has lifted hun­dreds of mil­lions out of poverty, in­clud­ing farm­ers, but the ru­ral-ur­ban di­vide re­mains wide.</p>
    <p>This year, the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment is likely to de­clare vic­tory in its bat­tle against ab­so­lute poverty and its goal to build a mod­er­ately pros­per­ous so­ci­ety by this year.</p>
    <p>But ob­servers have warned that it needs to deal more ef­fec­tively with the yawn­ing ru­ral-ur­ban di­vide if it wants to re­alise its dream of a re­ju­ve­nated na­tion and to es­cape the mid­dle-in­come trap.</p>
    <p>It is a mon­u­men­tal task and ob­servers will be look­ing to the next five-year eco­nomic plan, which is set to be fi­nalised at the fifth plenum of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party at the end of this month, to see how it will be tack­led.</p>
    <p>A YAWN­ING GAP</p>
    <p>China’s first re­forms from planned to mar­ket econ­omy be­gan in 1978 in the coun­try­side, when starv­ing farm­ers in one vil­lage se­cretly di­vided their com­mu­nal farm­land into house­hold plots to grow their own food. That was the ge­n­e­sis of the house­hold re­spon­si­bil­ity sys­tem, a ru­ral re­form that al­lowed farm­ers to farm their own plot and sell what was left of their pro­duce on pri­vate mar­kets after ful­fill­ing gov­ern­ment quo­tas.</p>
    <p>The first group of Chi­nese to “get rich” were farm­ers in the 1980s.</p>
    <p>The first decade of re­forms saw poverty re­duc­tion in the coun­try­side al­though ru­ral in­comes were still lower than ur­ban in­comes.</p>
    <p>But the ta­bles were turned from the 1990s when ac­cel­er­ated eco­nomic re­forms fo­cused on in­dus­trial de­vel­op­ment and en­trepreneur­ship, which en­riched the coastal ur­ban cen­tres.</p>
    <p>While ru­ral re­forms also took place, the changes in the coun­try­side failed to keep pace with those in the ur­ban cen­tres, with the de­vel­op­ment gap lead­ing to a widened wealth gap.</p>
    <p>In 1990, ur­ban an­nual per capita dis­pos­able in­come was slightly more than dou­ble that of ru­ral in­come, at 1,510.2 yuan to 686.3 yuan. By 2000, that had widened to 2.78 times and by 2010, ur­ban in­come was out­strip­ping ru­ral in­come by 3.23 times.</p>
    <p>The gap closed to 2.68 times in 2018, with ur­ban in­come at 39,250.8 yuan to the 14,617 yuan in ru­ral in­come. But this ru­ral in­come was in­clu­sive of re­mit­tances from mi­grant work­ers in the cities which made up 90 per cent of the to­tal ru­ral dis­pos­able in­come.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to some es­ti­mates, ru­ral in­come has been in de­cline since 2014 if re­mit­tances of mi­grant work­ers are sub­tracted.</p>
    <p>The Bei­jing Ori­ent Agribusi­ness Con­sul­tant es­ti­mated, based on gov­ern­ment data, that ru­ral per capita in­come ex­clud­ing mi­grant work­ers’ re­mit­tances fell to</p>
    <p>809 yuan at the end of June last year, com­pared with 1,209 yuan at the end of 2018.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers have given many rea­sons for the ru­ral-ur­ban gulf.</p>
    <p>Some key prob­lems that have been iden­ti­fied are land is­sues, the hukou sys­tem that lim­its mo­bil­ity for ru­ral res­i­dents and lack of equal ac­cess to ed­u­ca­tion, health­care, pensions and other so­cial ben­e­fits rel­a­tive to ur­ban res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment poli­cies ad­dress­ing these is­sues have mit­i­gated them, but not re­solved them.</p>
    <p>HOW RE­FORMS FELL SHORT</p>
    <p>China’s early ru­ral re­forms gave rise to the house­hold re­spon­si­bil­ity sys­tem in which vir­tu­ally all arable land was al­lo­cated to ru­ral house­holds.</p>
    <p>How­ever, all land in the coun­try­side is col­lec­tively owned and farm­ers have only land use rights. As in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion and ur­ban­i­sa­tion sped up and pres­sure on land in­creased, lo­cal gov­ern­ments be­gan ex­pro­pri­at­ing land from farm­ers for con­ver­sion into in­dus­trial or res­i­den­tial use. These gov­ern­ments made prof­its from such sales of land use rights by pay­ing small com­pen­sa­tions – or even no com­pen­sa­tion – to farm­ers and charg­ing large amounts to de­vel­op­ers.</p>
    <p>By 2015, some 120 mil­lion farm­ers had lost their land, many of whom had to move to the cities for ur­ban jobs, al­though many farm­ers who did not lose their land also chose to move to the cities.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, small plots re­stricted farm­ers’ abil­ity to in­crease yield and there­fore their in­come, while many plots lay fal­low be­cause their own­ers had moved to the cities for bet­ter-pay­ing but low-end jobs in fac­to­ries or the in­for­mal sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Changes to land laws through the years al­lowed farm­ers to rent their neigh­bours’ fields to in­crease their farm size. In the mean­time, how­ever, the coun­try­side saw a hol­low­ing out of young peo­ple, leav­ing mainly older folk and young chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Fresh re­forms, as part of a new plan to re­vi­talise ru­ral ar­eas that was ar­tic­u­lated by Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping in 2017, have kicked in to en­cour­age large, more ef­fi­cient, mod­ern farms. In ar­eas where such re­forms have taken place, farm­ers are given shares for their plots and lo­cal col­lec­tives trade these land as­sets on their be­half. In at least one vil­lage where such trans­ac­tions have taken place, the shares have ap­pre­ci­ated in value but the vil­lagers did not re­ceive any div­i­dends be­cause the col­lec­tive de­cided to in­vest the money on their be­half.</p>
    <p>As for the big farm­ers, the 30-year con­tract on farm­land they can sign may not be long enough – for peach farm­ers, for ex­am­ple, the trees are 50-year in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>It re­mains to be seen how well the re­forms will work.</p>
    <p>Apart from land is­sues, the hukou sys­tem has also held back Chi­nese farm­ers eco­nom­i­cally.</p>
    <p>The hukou or res­i­den­tial per­mit sys­tem sep­a­rates China’s pop­u­la­tion into ru­ral and ur­ban res­i­dents, and is seen by schol­ars to be a dis­crim­i­na­tory sys­tem against the coun­try’s ru­ral pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Started in 1958, it pre­vented ru­ral res­i­dents from mov­ing to the cities where work­ers en­joyed priv­i­leges closed to ru­ral ar­eas such as sub­sidised hous­ing, free ed­u­ca­tion, and med­i­cal care and old age pensions.</p>
    <p>The sys­tem was re­laxed in the 1980s to al­low farm­ers to work in ur­ban cen­tres as de­mand for labour in­creased there. With­out per­ma­nent res­i­den­tial per­mits, how­ever, such mi­grant work­ers are largely shut out from so­cial ben­e­fits for ur­ban res­i­dents, so it is hard and ex­pen­sive for them to ac­cess hous­ing, health­care and ed­u­ca­tion for their chil­dren in the cities where they work. Many leave their chil­dren in the care of grand­par­ents in the vil­lages.</p>
    <p>Changes through the years have done lit­tle to re­duce the so­cial dis­crim­i­na­tion against mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>In 2016, a new pol­icy was adopted to give 100 mil­lion mi­grant work­ers ur­ban hukou by this year in or­der to boost the ur­ban pop­u­la­tion and grow the mid­dle class, as China seeks to tran­si­tion from an ex­port-ori­ented econ­omy to one driven by con­sump­tion. More hukou re­forms were promised ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there is a mis­match between the gov­ern­ment’s free­ing up of re­stric­tions in small cities to en­cour­age mi­grant work­ers to move there and the work­ers’ de­sire to move to or re­main in the big cities where the jobs are and ser­vices such as health­care and ed­u­ca­tion are bet­ter.</p>
    <p>An­other fac­tor that has kept ru­ral res­i­dents from catch­ing up with their ur­ban cousins is ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can de­vel­op­ment econ­o­mist Scott Rozelle from Stan­ford Univer­sity, who stud­ies poverty and in­equal­ity in China, said the low level of high school ed­u­ca­tion is a prob­lem in ru­ral ar­eas, with only about 50 per cent go­ing to high school com­pared with 90 per cent in large cities. Less than 5 per cent of stu­dents at elite uni­ver­si­ties to­day have ru­ral roots, he noted at a re­cent we­bi­nar.</p>
    <p>Many ru­ral youth there­fore don’t have the skills to learn how to learn. “They are not go­ing to be able to take ad­van­tage of China’s new eco­nomic op­por­tu­ni­ties” that the new tech­nol­ogy in­dus­tries have thrown up, he said.</p>
    <p>This is par­tic­u­larly dev­as­tat­ing for mi­grant work­ers, given that bet­ter-pay­ing jobs in man­u­fac­tur­ing are fall­ing as fac­to­ries au­to­mate or move over­seas. They are left with­out even the lower-pay­ing ser­vice sec­tor jobs.</p>
    <p>For those who want to work as pro­fes­sional farm­ers in the big farms or start their own busi­nesses, they would first need ac­cess to bet­ter ed­u­ca­tion to equip them­selves with the skills to do so.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment needs to im­prove the qual­ity and avail­abil­ity of ru­ral schools, and en­cour­age ru­ral chil­dren to seek ed­u­ca­tion be­yond the manda­tory nine years, say an­a­lysts.</p>
    <p>The next five-year plan is likely to in­clude more re­forms to boost the in­come of ru­ral house­holds and mi­grant work­ers, and lift their spend­ing power. This is part of a new “dual cir­cu­la­tion” eco­nomic strat­egy that fo­cuses on in­creas­ing re­liance on do­mes­tic de­mand and re­duc­ing eco­nomic de­pen­dence on the rest of the world, even as China main­tains in­te­gra­tion with the rest of the world.</p>
    <p>An HSBC Bank re­port on the new five-year plan said land re­form is ex­pected to be ac­cel­er­ated to give ru­ral house­holds a big­ger share of gains from land reval­u­a­tion, as part of the drive to fuel con­sump­tion among the coun­try’s 551 mil­lion ru­ral res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>It also ex­pects hukou re­form to be sped up to give the 290 mil­lion mi­grant work­ers ac­cess to ur­ban so­cial wel­fare. This will likely lower their pre­cau­tion­ary sav­ings, which are dou­ble the av­er­age of ur­ban house­holds and, in turn, will en­cour­age them to spend more.</p>
    <p>Whether these re­forms – which should also in­clude ac­cess to bet­ter-qual­ity ed­u­ca­tion – will be deep enough to nar­row the ru­ral-ur­ban wealth gap re­mains to be seen. Like the farm­ers it seeks to help, the gov­ern­ment has to first plant the seeds, know­ing full well that in pol­icy plan­ning, as in agri­cul­ture, there is of­ten a gap between what’s de­sired and the out­come.</p>
