    <p>The Na­tional Coun­cil of So­cial Ser­vice (NCSS) is look­ing to hire up to 50 pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers or ex­ec­u­tives (PMEs) from out­side the so­cial ser­vice sec­tor to man­age vol­un­teers at char­i­ties here.</p>
    <p>As part of this ef­fort to help so­cial ser­vice agen­cies (SSAs) strengthen their vol­un­teer man­age­ment ca­pa­bil­i­ties, the NCSS launched the $8 mil­lion En­hanced Vol­un­teer Man­ager Fund­ing scheme on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Speaker of Par­lia­ment Tan Chuan-Jin, who is also the NCSS ad­viser, said at the scheme’s launch that there is a need to op­ti­mise vol­un­teer re­sources, es­pe­cially dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic which has se­verely af­fected do­na­tions and im­pacted the num­ber of vol­un­teers help­ing out at SSAs, given safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures. He added that it is cru­cial to have ded­i­cated vol­un­teer man­agers now to “jump-start the re­cov­ery of vol­un­teer pro­grammes and lay the ground­work for in­creased vol­un­teer man­age­ment ca­pac­ity over time”.</p>
    <p>A man­power short­age has al­ways been a key chal­lenge faced by SSAs, the NCSS said in a press re­lease yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a sec­tor sur­vey con­ducted by NCSS in 2018, only about half of the 242 agen­cies that re­sponded to the sur­vey have staff who man­age vol­un­teers. A pi­lot scheme from 2016 to 2018, when the NCSS funded man­agers of vol­un­teers at 10 SSAs, saw promis­ing re­sults.</p>
    <p>A study found that the pres­ence of such man­agers re­sulted in an in­crease in the num­ber of vol­un­teers at the SSAs. Their pres­ence also en­hanced vol­un­teers’ ex­pe­ri­ence and sat­is­fac­tion, and helped with the agency’s abil­ity to re­tain vol­un­teers, among other things.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said: “For those who do it well, you are aware that good vol­un­teer man­age­ment is akin to cre­at­ing more head­count with­out tak­ing the head­count on board, es­pe­cially when the vol­un­teers are more reg­u­lar, have re­ceived some train­ing, and are able to com­mit his or her time.</p>
    <p>“This in turn eases the load on the agency’s staff.” To ad­dress con­cerns over vol­un­teer man­age­ment in the pan­demic, the NCSS has also pub­lished a Vol­un­teer Con­ti­nu­ity Plan­ning Guide that helps SSAs to en­sure the con­ti­nu­ity of vol­un­teer ac­tiv­ity in times of cri­sis.</p>
