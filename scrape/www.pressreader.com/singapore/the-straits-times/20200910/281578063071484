    <p>Un­con­trolled wild­fires are raging across the west­ern United States, in­cin­er­at­ing the Wash­ing­ton town of Malden and threat­en­ing com­mu­ni­ties in Ore­gon and Cal­i­for­nia. A search is un­der way for the res­i­dents of Malden a day af­ter a firestorm de­stroyed 80 per cent of its homes.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>SACRA­MENTO (Cal­i­for­nia) Un­con­trolled wild­fires driven by high winds and un­prece­dented tem­per­a­tures raged across the US West on Tues­day, in­cin­er­at­ing the Wash­ing­ton town of Malden and threat­en­ing com­mu­ni­ties in Ore­gon and Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>Fire­fight­ers and emer­gency re­spon­ders searched for res­i­dents of tiny Malden, about 480km east of Seat­tle, a day af­ter a firestorm de­stroyed 80 per cent of its homes, along with the fire sta­tion, post of­fice, city hall and li­brary.</p>
    <p>“The scale of this disas­ter re­ally can’t be ex­pressed in words,” said Mr Brett My­ers, sher­iff of Whit­man County, where the town of be­tween 200 and 300 peo­ple is lo­cated. “I pray ev­ery­one got out in time.”</p>
    <p>The fire that de­stroyed Malden erupted about noon on Sun­day, driven by winds of 65kmh, Mr My­ers told Reuters. The au­thor­i­ties went door to door or­der­ing evac­u­a­tions be­fore the blaze ar­rived. The fire en­gulfed most of the town over the course of about three hours.</p>
    <p>“It moved in­cred­i­bly fast,” Mr My­ers said.</p>
    <p>That fire was one of dozens of large blazes burn­ing in Wash­ing­ton, Ore­gon and Cal­i­for­nia over the Labour Day hol­i­day week­end, as the ther­mome­ter soared. Tem­per­a­tures in the west­ern part of Los An­ge­les’ San Fer­nando Val­ley topped 49 deg C.</p>
    <p>“I have no pa­tience for cli­mate change de­niers,” Cal­i­for­nia Gover­nor Gavin New­som said, point­ing to the high tem­per­a­tures, as well as years of drought that have killed mil­lions of trees, pro­vid­ing fuel for fires. “It sim­ply is com­pletely in­con­sis­tent... with the re­al­ity on the ground.”</p>
    <p>About 14,000 fire­fight­ers bat­tled 25 blazes in Cal­i­for­nia with more than 890,308ha charred since the fire sea­son got an early – and deadly – start last month, a record for this point in the year, the Cal­i­for­nia De­part­ment of Forestry and Fire Pro­tec­tion (CalFire) said on Tues­day. The state’s peak fire sea­son has yet to be­gin.</p>
    <p>Fires forced thou­sands of res­i­dents to evac­u­ate their homes and closed sev­eral na­tional forests across the state.</p>
    <p>Smoke dark­ened the skies and made breath­ing dif­fi­cult as far north as Canada and well down the coast to­wards South­ern Cal­i­for­nia. In the state cap­i­tal of Sacra­mento, the skies were grey and it was dif­fi­cult to breathe as high winds car­ried in dust and smoke from nu­mer­ous fires. Air through­out much of the Sacra­mento and San Joaquin val­leys, the state’s agri­cul­tural bread­bas­ket, was rated “haz­ardous” by the state.</p>
    <p>The Creek Fire in the Fresno area</p>
    <p>of cen­tral Cal­i­for­nia, which caused the week­end emer­gency evac­u­a­tion of more than 200 peo­ple va­ca­tion­ing at a pop­u­lar reser­voir, grew overnight un­der what CalFire called “ex­treme con­di­tions”. The blaze, which started last Fri­day, threat­ened the com­mu­nity of Shaver Lake, among oth­ers, fu­elled in part by trees weak­ened by drought and killed by the in­va­sive bark bee­tle, the fire agency said.</p>
    <p>At a news con­fer­ence on Tues­day, Mr New­som praised the fire­fight­ers who led a he­li­copter evac­u­a­tion of the area, say­ing they saved 214 peo­ple in smoky con­di­tions that made it dif­fi­cult to see.</p>
    <p>“They very eas­ily could have turned around and said the smoke made that mis­sion too dan­ger­ous,” Mr New­som said, call­ing the res­cuers heroic. Res­cue ef­forts con­tin­ued on Tues­day, he said, with about 165 peo­ple air­lifted to safety and es­cape routes sought for more than a dozen more.</p>
    <p>By Tues­day morn­ing, the fire was com­pletely un­con­tained and had burned 58,275ha, CalFire said. Fire­fight­ers on the ground were also in peril.</p>
