    <p>Manager Pep Guardi­ola hailed another out­stand­ing per­for­mance from John Stones, as the de­fender’s opener put Manch­ester City on the road to their fourth straight English League Cup fi­nal with a 2-0 away win on Wed­nes­day over city ri­vals Manch­ester United. Af­ter strug­gling with poor form and in­juries for years, Stones has formed a strong pair­ing with Ruben Dias this sea­son.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>LON­DON Manch­ester City boss Pep Guardi­ola said it took de­fender John Stones a lot longer than ex­pected to re­dis­cover his best form but he praised the English­man’s per­se­ver­ance af­ter their 2-0 League Cup win over Manch­ester United on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre-back has strug­gled with in­juries and poor form in re­cent cam­paigns but has found his rhythm this sea­son, forg­ing a strong part­ner­ship with Por­tuguese de­fender and City’s sum­mer sign­ing Ruben Dias.</p>
    <p>Stones, 26, opened the scor­ing in the sec­ond half against United – his first goal in three years for the club – be­fore Brazil­ian Fer­nand­inho added another to send the hold­ers into the fi­nal for the fourth straight year.</p>
    <p>“All credit for him (Stones). In a long ca­reer, you al­ways have ups and downs. Un­for­tu­nately, he strug­gled longer than we ex­pected and he ex­pected – but his come­back is ab­so­lutely down to him,” said Guardi­ola, who had as many as six first-team play­ers side­lined with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“He made another out­stand­ing per­for­mance. But the most im­por­tant thing he has been able to do – some­thing he has strug­gled with the past three or four years – is play four, five, six games in a row. This is so im­por­tant.”</p>
    <p>Stones, who faced ques­tions about his fu­ture last sea­son, said his resur­gence was down to hard work.</p>
    <p>“I’m try­ing to play as many games as I can... give everything for the shirt. Stay­ing true to my­self, to what I can do and what I can im­prove on,” he told Sky Sports.</p>
    <p>“Play­ing in th­ese big games is some­thing I thrive on, the team thrives on. I’m try­ing to im­prove as much as I can.”</p>
    <p>City meet Tot­ten­ham Hot­spur at Wem­b­ley in the fi­nal on April 25.</p>
    <p>Guardi­ola’s men now have the chance to equal Liver­pool’s record of win­ning four suc­ces­sive League Cups from 1981 to 1984.</p>
    <p>“I know the Carabao (League) Cup is not the Cham­pi­ons League but four times a row is in­cred­i­ble,” he added. “I’m so im­pressed with the qual­ity of this team.”</p>
    <p>If they were to achieve that feat, Stones and Dias could be cru­cial.</p>
    <p>City have now kept nine clean sheets in the 11 games Stones has started this sea­son.</p>
    <p>As a pair, they con­ceded their first goal to­gether in over 800 min­utes in stop­page time dur­ing Sun­day’s 3-1 Premier League win at Chelsea. Their record now stands at one goal against in 900 min­utes.</p>
    <p>Spa­niard Guardi­ola seems to have fi­nally cre­ated a for­mi­da­ble cen­tre-back pair­ing to solve his side’s de­fen­sive is­sues.</p>
    <p>Last sea­son, City con­ceded 35 goals i n 38 Premier League matches, more than their 2017-18 (27) and 2018-19 (23) ti­tle-win­ning sea­sons. As it stands, they have con­ceded the fewest goals (13) in the league, al­though they have also played two games fewer than lead­ers Liver­pool.</p>
    <p>But as a met­ric, goals con­ceded is of only lim­ited use. City are so good at re­tain­ing pos­ses­sion that most op­po­nents do not have enough of the ball to cause them prob­lems, as United found out them­selves.</p>
    <p>“It’s not psy­cho­log­i­cal, some­times you meet good teams in the semis,” said Sol­sk­jaer, whose side also fell to City at this stage of the com­pe­ti­tion last sea­son and who have now also lost a fourth semi-fi­nal in the past two sea­sons.</p>
    <p>“We met the best team in Eng­land and for me we didn’t have enough to­day.</p>
    <p>“But we’re get­ting closer. This is</p>
    <p>a much bet­ter Manch­ester United com­pared to a year ago in those semis, that’s pos­i­tive but not enough.”</p>
    <p>For­mer United mid­fielder Roy Keane agreed that the Red Devils are still “a lit­tle bit short”, adding that tal­is­man Bruno Fer­nan­des must do more in big games.</p>
    <p>The Por­tuguese mid­fielder has made a big im­pres­sion af­ter join­ing from Sport­ing Lis­bon last year, with 27 goals and 17 as­sists over­all, but had a quiet night.</p>
    <p>“It’s not easy win­ning foot­ball tro­phies. Fer­nan­des has had praise for the last few months and peo­ple have been com­par­ing him to (Eric) Can­tona,” Keane told Sky Sports.</p>
    <p>“The top play­ers turn up in the big oc­ca­sions. And that’s what the Can­tonas used to do. That’s where this team are a lit­tle bit short.</p>
    <p>“They prob­a­bly need one or two more play­ers to come into this squad.”</p>
    <p>ROY KEANE, for­mer United cap­tain, who feels they need one or two ad­di­tions to be the fin­ished prod­uct.</p>
