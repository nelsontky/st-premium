    <p>This year, the num­ber of Asian Amer­i­can el­i­gi­ble vot­ers will hit a new high of more than 11 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>His­tor­i­cally, voter turnout among Asian Amer­i­cans has been tepid. In 2016, more than 64 per cent of white Amer­i­cans turned out to vote, com­pared with just 49 per cent of el­i­gi­ble Asian Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>But this year, many Asian Amer­i­cans are hop­ing that a new en­thu­si­asm for po­lit­i­cal en­gage­ment will trans­late grow­ing num­bers into ac­tual po­lit­i­cal clout.</p>
    <p>“It is in­cum­bent on each and ev­ery one of us to vote,” In­dian Amer­i­can Praveen Va­jpeyi, 57, a New York-based cre­ative direc­tor, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“We can’t sit this one out. And peo­ple feel a deep need to en­gage.” The sen­ti­ment seems wide­spread. “En­thu­si­asm lev­els are high,” AAPI Data, a pub­lisher of de­mo­graphic data and pol­icy re­search on Asian Amer­i­cans and Pa­cific Is­lan­ders, con­cluded from its just-re­leased 2020 Asian Amer­i­can Voter Sur­vey.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey, based on a na­tional sam­ple of 1,569 Asian Amer­i­can reg­is­tered vot­ers, was con­ducted from July 4 to Sept 10. It cov­ered Chi­nese, In­dian, Korean, Viet­namese, Ja­panese and Filipino vot­ers and was of­fered in English, Chi­nese, Korean and Viet­namese.</p>
    <p>Over half – 54 per cent – of reg­is­tered Asian Amer­i­cans said that com­pared with pre­vi­ous elec­tions, they are more en­thu­si­as­tic than usual about vot­ing, AAPI said.</p>
    <p>DEMO­CRAT-LEAN­ING</p>
    <p>A ma­jor­ity (54 per cent) planned to vote for Demo­cratic can­di­date Joe Bi­den, com­pared with 30 per cent who planned to sup­port Re­pub­li­can Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den was strongly favoured among all na­tional ori­gin groups, ex­cept Viet­namese Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>In­dian Amer­i­cans are more likely to iden­tify as Demo­cratic, at 50 per cent, while Viet­namese Amer­i­cans are more likely to iden­tify as Re­pub­li­can, at 42 per cent.</p>
    <p>And 14 per cent of Asian Amer­i­can reg­is­tered vot­ers re­mained un­de­cided, with Chi­nese Amer­i­cans the high­est – 22 per cent – in that cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>NEW GEN­ER­A­TION</p>
    <p>The nat­u­ral­i­sa­tion of ci­ti­zens ap­prox­i­mately dou­bled be­tween 2000 and 2018.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond- and third-gen­er­a­tion In­dian im­mi­grants are less in­vested than their par­ents in their old coun­tries and are grow­ing up as Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>The in­crease i n en­gage­ment comes partly from peo­ple who have grown up in the United States in the past 20 to 30 years, whose par­ents were im­mi­grants, and who are now more in­te­grated and in­volved in Amer­i­can so­ci­ety, said Mr Andrew Shiue, 44, a Tai­wanese-Amer­i­can law pro­fes­sional in New York.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view, Mr Shiue men­tioned the can­di­dacy of Mr Andrew Yang as an in­flec­tion point.</p>
    <p>Mr Yang could have been a con­tender.</p>
    <p>The Cal­i­for­nia-based mil­lion­aire en­tre­pre­neur’s bid for the Demo­cratic Party’s ticket did not sur­vive the pri­maries, but even though some Asian Amer­i­cans cringed at his “The op­po­site of Don­ald Trump is an Asian man who likes math” shtick, he made an im­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>“By lean­ing into the stereo­type, Yang ef­fec­tively said: Re­mind me – why should I be on the de­fen­sive about this,” wrote Mr Wes­ley Yang, au­thor of the book The Souls Of Yel­low Folk, last Oc­to­ber in The Washington Post, when Mr Yang’s cam­paign was still ac­tive.</p>
    <p>He had “gone from be­ing a novelty can­di­date to pro­vid­ing a glimpse at a fu­ture when Asian Amer­i­cans be­come universal fig­ures in Amer­i­can po­lit­i­cal life, and re­alise their po­ten­tial not just to serve but to lead”, the au­thor wrote.</p>
    <p>NE­GLECTED BY PAR­TIES</p>
    <p>The ma­jor­ity of Asian Amer­i­cans have not been con­tacted by ei­ther ma­jor party this cy­cle, how­ever.</p>
    <p>“Po­lit­i­cal par­ties have yet to har­ness the power of the Asian Amer­i­can vote de­spite the fact that many re­main per­suad­able,” the AAPI sur­vey con­cluded.</p>
    <p>“The 2020 Asian Amer­i­can Voter Sur­vey shows that about half of all re­spon­dents were not con­tacted by ei­ther ma­jor party. With a higher than av­er­age re­sponse of vot­ers who do not sub­scribe with ei­ther party, party out­reach will be crit­i­cal for Asian Amer­i­can vot­ers.”</p>
    <p>Asian Amer­i­cans are as di­verse a group as Asians, of course.</p>
    <p>And while they gen­er­ally lean Demo­cratic, the busi­ness com­mu­nity tends to be con­ser­va­tive and favours low taxes.</p>
    <p>But in gen­eral, most will vote based on is­sues, of which there are three big ones: racial dis­crim­i­na­tion, the eco­nomic cri­sis that is not be­ing ad­dressed due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, and im­mi­gra­tion.</p>
    <p>ENOUGH, SAYS THE HOUSE</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately on Thurs­day, Asian Amer­i­cans re­ceived good news on the first is­sue. The House, in a 243-164 vote, passed a res­o­lu­tion con­demn­ing “all forms of anti-Asian sen­ti­ment as re­lated to Covid-19”.</p>
    <p>The mea­sure came af­ter a rise in re­cent months of racial ha­rass­ment, mainly of Chi­nese Amer­i­cans, par­tic­u­larly on the back of Pres­i­dent Trump blam­ing China – though the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion tries to sep­a­rate the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment from the Chi­nese peo­ple – for the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Grace Meng, a Demo­cratic con­gress­woman from New York, the main spon­sor of the res­o­lu­tion, said the vote showed that “the House said ‘Enough’ ”.</p>
    <p>“For months, Asian Amer­i­cans in my home state of New York and in com­mu­ni­ties through­out the na­tion have been ver­bally and phys­i­cally at­tacked, spat on and shunned,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Enough of the de­mean­ing us­ages of ‘Chi­nese virus’, ‘Wuhan virus’ and ‘Kung-flu’, es­pe­cially from our na­tion’s lead­ers such as Pres­i­dent Trump,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Enough of the scape­goat­ing.”</p>
