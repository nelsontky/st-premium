    <p>RED VELVET’S IRENE APOLOGISES OVER BULLYING: South Korean singer Irene</p>
    <p>(left), the leader of K-pop girl group Red</p>
    <p>Velvet, has apol­o­gised af­ter she was ac­cused of bullying a stylist.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, a stylist who said she has 15 years of ex­pe­ri­ence in the in­dus­try wrote on so­cial me­dia about an un­pleas­ant ex­pe­ri­ence with an un­named celebrity. She said she felt hu­mil­i­ated and cried af­ter be­ing “tram­pled and abused”.</p>
    <p>While she did not men­tion names, she used the hash­tags #psy­cho and #mon­ster. Psy­cho is a song recorded by Red Velvet, while Mon­ster is recorded by Irene & Seulgi, a sub-unit of Red Velvet.</p>
    <p>In an In­sta­gram post late on Thurs­day, Irene, 29, wrote in Korean: “I sin­cerely apol­o­gise for hurt­ing the stylist with my fool­ish at­ti­tude and care­less words and ac­tions.”</p>
    <p>SM En­ter­tain­ment, Red Velvet’s agency, re­leased a state­ment say­ing it will work hard to pre­vent such in­ci­dents from re­cur­ring. It added that Irene, whose real name is Bae Joo-hyun, met the stylist and apol­o­gised to her on Thurs­day af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>The ac­tiv­i­ties of Red Velvet, whose other mem­bers are Seulgi, Wendy, Joy and Yeri, have been af­fected as a re­sult. They were due to at­tend an on­line fan meet­ing as part of Korean Cul­ture Fes­ti­val to­day, but SM has told the or­gan­is­ers they would not be do­ing so.</p>
