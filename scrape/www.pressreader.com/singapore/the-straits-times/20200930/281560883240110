    <p>The com­pul­sory na­tional health in­sur­ance scheme is set to get a mas­sive re­vamp next year, with wider ben­e­fits pro­posed so it can cover more and larger hos­pi­tal bills. The pro­posal in­cludes rais­ing the yearly claim limit un­der MediShield Life from $100,000 to $150,000.</p>
    <p>The com­pul­sory na­tional health in­sur­ance scheme is set to get a mas­sive re­vamp next year, with wider ben­e­fits pro­posed so it can cover more and larger hos­pi­tal bills.</p>
    <p>The pro­posal in­cludes rais­ing the yearly claim limit un­der MediShield Life from $100,000 to $150,000.</p>
    <p>To pay for th­ese ben­e­fits and ris­ing healthcare costs, pre­mi­ums are ex­pected to go up next year by as much as 35 per cent.</p>
    <p>This will be the first in­crease in MediShield Life pre­mi­ums since the scheme was launched five years ago.</p>
    <p>At the up­per end, the pro­posed hike will ex­ceed $500 a year.</p>
    <p>But given the dif­fi­cult times Sin­ga­pore­ans are fac­ing now, Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong said the Govern­ment will soften the im­pact of the pre­mium in­crease with a spe­cial Covid-19 sub­sidy for the first two years.</p>
    <p>In the first year, all Sin­ga­pore­ans will get a 70 per cent sub­sidy on the in­crease. This goes down to 30 per cent in the se­cond year. This will cost the Govern­ment $360 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>This is on top of the ex­ist­ing sub­si­dies of 15 per cent to 50 per cent given to mid­dle- and lower-in­come groups, and 40 per cent to 60 per cent for the Pioneer Gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The Merdeka Gen­er­a­tion re­ceives ad­di­tional age-based sub­si­dies of 5 per cent to 10 per cent.</p>
    <p>In all, sub­si­dies for the next three years will amount to $2.2 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The pro­posal will al­low for wider ben­e­fits, in­clud­ing:</p>
    <p>• Higher cover­age for sub-acute care at com­mu­nity hos­pi­tals – such as for some­one re­cov­er­ing from a heart at­tack – as this is 20 per cent more ex­pen­sive than nor­mal re­ha­bil­i­ta­tive care.</p>
    <p>• Higher an­nual claim limit of $150,000, from the cur­rent</p>
    <p>$100,000.</p>
    <p>• Higher claim lim­its for some charges, such as for in­ten­sive care, which will be raised from $1,200 a day to $2,200 a day, dial­y­sis and psy­chi­atric care.</p>
    <p>• An ad­di­tional $200 a day claim for daily ward charges for the first two days of hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion, when most tests and in­ves­ti­ga­tions are done. • MediShield Life will in fu­ture also cover treat­ment for at­tempted sui­cide, self-in­jury, sub­stance abuse and al­co­holism.</p>
    <p>• Lower de­ductible of $2,000 (down from $3,000) for peo­ple 80 years and older for day surgery. This brings it in line with their de­ductible amount in a C-class ward, so pa­tients will not need to be hos­pi­talised just to qual­ify for in­sur­ance cover.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the cap on claims for peo­ple treated at pri­vate hos­pi­tals will be re­duced from 35 per cent of the bill to 25 per cent.</p>
    <p>Based on re­cent bills, 35 per cent of pri­vate hos­pi­tal care amounts to far higher sums than bills in­curred by sub­sidised pa­tients.</p>
    <p>The new claim lim­its should bring MediShield Life back in line with its orig­i­nal man­date to cover 90 per cent of sub­sidised bills beyond the ini­tial de­ductible.</p>
    <p>It was re­vealed last year that only 80 per cent of sub­sidised bills were fully cov­ered.</p>
    <p>Th­ese changes are ex­pected to get rolling some time in the first quar­ter of next year.</p>
    <p>MediShield Life Council chair­man Fang Ai Lian said: “We have to pe­ri­od­i­cally re­view and up­date the scheme ben­e­fits and pre­mi­ums to keep pace with evolv­ing med­i­cal prac­tice, healthcare cost in­fla­tion and ac­tual claims ex­pe­ri­ence, so that it con­tin­ues to pro­vide as­sur­ance for Sin­ga­pore­ans, while re­main­ing sus­tain­able.”</p>
    <p>From now, re­views will be car­ried out ev­ery three years.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan Wu Meng, head of the Govern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee for Health, sup­ports the changes, although he said some of the pre­mium in­creases are “sig­nif­i­cant”.</p>
    <p>He told The Straits Times: “The re­vised pol­icy year claim limit and the ICU claim lim­its are con­sis­tent with sup­port­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans through cat­a­strophic ill­ness.”</p>
    <p>As for the re­moval of some ex­clu­sions, he said: “This would also be a key state­ment about in­clu­siv­ity and the tone we want in our so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans will re­ceive en­hanced MediShield Life ben­e­fits un­der the first ma­jor re­view of the na­tional in­sur­ance pro­gramme to ad­dress gaps in cur­rent cover­age.</p>
    <p>They in­clude a $50,000 in­crease in the an­nual pol­icy claim limit, and the in­clu­sion of treat­ments for at­tempted sui­cide, drug ad­dic­tion and al­co­holism.</p>
    <p>Launched i n Novem­ber 2015, MediShield Life is a ba­sic health in­sur­ance plan giv­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents life­long pro­tec­tion against large med­i­cal bills.</p>
    <p>In a re­lease to­gether with the MediShield Life Council, the Health Min­istry (MOH) said yesterday that changes re­sult­ing from the cur­rent re­view are ex­pected to be im­ple­mented early next year, fol­low­ing a round of public con­sul­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>The ex­er­cise, which be­gan in 2018, iden­ti­fied at least five ar­eas where i mprove­ments could be made.</p>
    <p>HIGHER AN­NUAL CLAIM LIM­ITS</p>
    <p>The council high­lighted the case of an eight-year-old Sin­ga­porean who was hos­pi­talised for 147 days due to epilepsy.</p>
    <p>The child stayed i n a C-class ward, spent more than 80 days in the in­ten­sive care unit, and un­der­went five sur­gi­cal pro­ce­dures.</p>
    <p>This re­sulted in a to­tal bill of $142,100 after govern­ment sub­si­dies.</p>
    <p>Due to MediShield Life’s cur­rent pol­icy year claim limit of $100,000, the child’s fam­ily had to pay the re­main­ing $42,100 through Medis­ave, cash or Med­i­fund.</p>
    <p>To pro­tect pa­tients from the costs of such ex­cep­tion­ally large bills, the council rec­om­mended rais­ing the pol­icy year claim limit to $150,000.</p>
    <p>For the child’s fam­ily, this would have meant that MediShield Life could cover $136,037 of the bill, after co-in­sur­ance and a de­ductible that would come up to a to­tal of $6,063 and which could be paid us­ing Medis­ave, cash or Med­i­fund.</p>
    <p>Med­i­fund is avail­able only to those who are as­sessed to be needy.</p>
    <p>The move will also pro­tect Sin­ga­pore­ans from the high costs of mul­ti­ple pe­ri­ods of hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion dur­ing the year.</p>
    <p>HIGHER COVER­AGE FOR SUB-ACUTE CARE</p>
    <p>Next, the council cited is­sues that arise from the dif­fer­ence in the cost of sub-acute care and re­ha­bil­i­ta­tive care at com­mu­nity hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>Re­ha­bil­i­ta­tive care refers to ther­apy to im­prove one’s post-ill­ness dis­abil­ity and func­tional im­pair­ment.</p>
    <p>Sub-acute care is for com­pli­cated med­i­cal con­di­tions that re­quire ad­di­tional med­i­cal and nursing care at a lower in­ten­sity com­pared with that pro­vided at the acute hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, pa­tients at com­mu­nity hos­pi­tals could claim up to $350 a day from MediShield Life, re­gard­less of whether they needed re­ha­bil­i­ta­tive or sub-acute care.</p>
    <p>But sub-acute care tends to be more ex­pen­sive than re­ha­bil­i­ta­tive care, so pa­tients who need the for­mer are not as well cov­ered by MediShield Life as those who need the lat­ter, said the council.</p>
    <p>It noted the case of a 60-year-old who was hos­pi­talised for 25 days in a com­mu­nity hos­pi­tal to re­ceive sub-acute care for a bone in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The bill came to $10,700 after govern­ment sub­si­dies.</p>
    <p>Un­der the cur­rent MediShield Life claim lim­its, the pa­tient was able to claim up to $8,750.</p>
    <p>After co-in­sur­ance, this meant the pa­tient paid the re­main­ing $2,212.50 from Medis­ave.</p>
    <p>Un­der the new lim­its, how­ever, the en­tire bill would be cov­ered, ex­cept for $321 in co-in­sur­ance that can be paid us­ing Medis­ave.</p>
    <p>“In­tro­duc­ing sep­a­rate claim lim­its for sub-acute care and re­ha­bil­i­ta­tive care will en­sure that both groups of pa­tients will en­joy sim­i­lar lev­els of cover­age un­der MediShield Life,” said the council.</p>
    <p>HIGHER DAILY WARD CLAIM LIM­ITS</p>
    <p>Another ex­am­ple raised was that of a 37-year-old Sin­ga­porean who was hos­pi­talised for two days due to a bac­te­rial in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The bill after govern­ment sub­si­dies was $1,800, but the cur­rent claim limit for nor­mal wards is capped at $700 each day.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the MediShield Life pay­out was capped at $1,260 after co-in­sur­ance, with the re­main­ing $540 paid for us­ing Medis­ave.</p>
    <p>The council rec­om­mended that the cap be raised to $800 a day for nor­mal wards, with an ad­di­tional claim limit of $200 a day for the first two days.</p>
    <p>“Pa­tients tend to in­cur higher charges dur­ing the ear­lier part of their hos­pi­tal stay, due to costly tests and in­ves­ti­ga­tions to di­ag­nose their con­di­tions,” said the council.</p>
    <p>“This re­sults in pa­tients with ear­lier dis­charges be­ing not as well cov­ered as pa­tients with longer stays, as the ag­gre­gate claim limit over a longer hos­pi­tal stay is gen­er­ally enough to cover the high ini­tial charges.”</p>
    <p>It also rec­om­mended the cap for in­ten­sive care unit (ICU) wards be raised from $1,200 a day to $2,200 each day, with an ad­di­tional claim limit of $200 a day for the first two days.</p>
    <p>Un­der the rec­om­mended lim­its, the pa­tient would have been able to use MediShield Life to pay $1,620 of the bill fol­low­ing co-in­sur­ance, with $180 re­main­ing to be paid for us­ing Medis­ave.</p>
    <p>LOWER DAY SURGERY DE­DUCTIBLE</p>
    <p>Pa­tients aged 80 and older will have the de­ductible for day surgery low­ered from $3,000 to $2,000, to align it with the de­ductible for inpatient stays in C-class wards.</p>
    <p>The de­ductible is the amount a pa­tient must pay once ev­ery pol­icy year be­fore their MediShield Life pay­out starts.</p>
    <p>“This will en­sure that pa­tients are not dis­cour­aged from choos­ing day surgery over an inpatient stay, as they will be sub­ject to the same de­ductible re­gard­less of their choice,” said the council.</p>
    <p>It added that the de­ductibles for day surgery pa­tients below 80 are al­ready aligned with the de­ductible for inpatient stays in C-class wards.</p>
    <p>RE­MOVAL OF</p>
    <p>SOME EX­CLU­SIONS</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, the council also rec­om­mended re­mov­ing the stan­dard ex­clu­sions for treat­ments aris­ing from at­tempted sui­cide, in­ten­tional self-in­jury, drug ad­dic­tion and al­co­holism.</p>
    <p>This means pa­tients seek­ing treat­ment as a re­sult of th­ese can be cov­ered un­der MediShield Life.</p>
    <p>“There is in­creas­ing recog­ni­tion that proper treat­ment is the ap­pro­pri­ate ap­proach to­wards self­harm,” said the council.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing the Amer­i­can So­ci­ety of Ad­dic­tion Medicine, the council added that ad­dic­tion is a chronic med­i­cal dis­ease in­volv­ing com­plex in­ter­ac­tions among brain cir­cuits, ge­net­ics, the en­vi­ron­ment and an in­di­vid­ual’s life ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>It added: “Pre­ven­tion ef­forts and treat­ment ap­proaches for ad­dic­tion are gen­er­ally as suc­cess­ful as those for other chronic dis­eases.</p>
    <p>“MediShield Life, as the na­tional health in­sur­ance, can sup­port in­di­vid­u­als in over­com­ing their ad­dic­tions and their re­cov­ery process.”</p>
