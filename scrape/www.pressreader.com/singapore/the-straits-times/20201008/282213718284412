    <p>A free­hold three-storey con­ser­va­tion shophouse used by the pop­u­lar Boon Tong Kee chicken rice restau­rant is up for sale for $9.5 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The price works out to about $2,369 per sq ft based on the to­tal built-up area of 4,010 sq ft, said mar­ket­ing agent CBRE yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The shophouse at 199 East Coast Road is on a 1,795 sq ft site zoned for com­mer­cial use with a plot ra­tio of three.</p>
    <p>Its max­i­mum al­low­able gross floor area is about 5,385 sq ft, sub­ject to ap­proval, said CBRE.</p>
    <p>The shophouse is fully ten­anted, with the ground and third floors leased to Boon Tong Kee restau­rant, which has been op­er­at­ing at the premises for more than 15 years.</p>
    <p>This will pro­vide a buyer with im­me­di­ate rental in­come, CBRE said.</p>
    <p>Once the ex­ist­ing leases ex­pire, the buyer could max­imise the plot ra­tio by build­ing a rear ex­ten­sion to in­crease the floor area by 34 per cent, it added.</p>
    <p>There will be no ad­di­tional buyer’s stamp duty or seller’s stamp duty im­posed on lo­cal or for­eign buy­ers.</p>
    <p>The up­com­ing Marine Pa­rade MRT sta­tion is close by and set to open by 2023, while re­fur­bish­ment work at the nearby I12 Ka­tong mall is due to be com­pleted by next year.</p>
    <p>Other com­mer­cial de­vel­op­ments near the prop­erty in­clude Ka­tong Point and Park­way Pa­rade malls. There is also a large res­i­den­tial catch­ment from the Marine Pa­rade hous­ing es­tate.</p>
    <p>CBRE senior di­rec­tor of cap­i­tal mar­kets Cle­mence Lee said there has been an in­crease in in­ter­est for shop­houses in the East Coast area re­cently, per­haps be­cause food and bev­er­age out­lets and stores are do­ing well with more peo­ple fre­quent­ing the neigh­bour­hood as they work from home.</p>
    <p>“The area is ex­pected to be­come even more dy­namic upon the com­ple­tion of rejuvenati­on ac­tiv­i­ties,” he noted.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar prop­er­ties sold in the vicin­ity in­clude 139 East Coast Road, which was trans­acted last month at $6.6 mil­lion, added Mr Lee. A row of three shop­houses at 101-105 East Coast Road changed hands re­cently at $14 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The sale of 199 East Coast Road will be con­ducted via an ex­pres­sion of in­ter­est ex­er­cise, which will close at 3pm on Nov 12.</p>
    <p>The shophouse is fully ten­anted, with the ground and third floors leased to Boon Tong Kee restau­rant, which has been op­er­at­ing at the premises for more than 15 years.</p>
