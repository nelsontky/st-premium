    <p>LONDON • Pep Guardi­ola yes­ter­day de­manded an apol­ogy from Jose Mour­inho, af­ter Manch­ester City’s two-year sus­pen­sion from Euro­pean foot­ball was over­turned by the Court of Ar­bi­tra­tion for Sport (CAS) on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>At a vir­tual press con­fer­ence ahead of Tot­ten­ham’s trip to New­cas­tle to­day, Spurs man­ager Mour­inho had called the CAS rul­ing a “dis­grace­ful de­ci­sion”.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that City had still been fined €10 mil­lion (S$15.88 mil­lion) by the CAS, a re­duc­tion from the ini­tial amount of €30 mil­lion im­posed by Uefa, he said: “If City are not guilty of it (breach­ing Fi­nan­cial Fair Play rules), then you are not pun­ished with €10 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>“If you’re not guilty, you shouldn’t have a fine. If they are guilty, the de­ci­sion is also a dis­grace and you should be banned from the com­pe­ti­tion.”</p>
    <p>The fine re­lated only to City’s fail­ure to co­op­er­ate with Uefa’s in­ves­ti­ga­tion rather than FFP breaches.</p>
    <p>How­ever, City man­ager Guardi­ola hit back at Mour­inho, claim­ing his club’s rep­u­ta­tion had been smeared by the furore around the fi­nan­cial dop­ing al­le­ga­tions. The spec­u­la­tion led to the ban, which was an­nounced in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Call­ing the ver­dict a “good day for foot­ball”, the Spa­niard said: “Jose and all the (other) man­agers should know that we were dam­aged.</p>
    <p>“We should be apol­o­gised (to). Be­cause, like I said many times, if we did some­thing wrong, we will ac­cept ab­so­lutely.</p>
    <p>“We have the right to de­fend our­selves when we be­lieve what we have done is cor­rect, is right. Three in­de­pen­dent judges said this.</p>
    <p>“The peo­ple say we cheated and lie many, many times. The pre­sump­tion of in­no­cence was not there and af­ter, when it hap­pened and it was right, of course we are in­cred­i­bly happy be­cause we can de­fend what we have done on the pitch.</p>
    <p>“I know for the elite clubs – Liver­pool, Manch­ester United, Arse­nal – are not com­fort­able with us be­ing here. But we de­serve to be here, we de­serve to be stronger.</p>
    <p>“Guys, ac­cept it. If you do not agree, knock on the door and speak to our chair­man and chief ex­ec­u­tive, don’t go whis­per­ing. We in­vested a lot of money but we did it in the right things.”</p>
    <p>He re­served his harsh­est com­ments for La Liga pres­i­dent Javier Te­bas, who said the CAS was “not up to stan­dard” for ex­on­er­at­ing City.</p>
    <p>Said Guardi­ola: “He is an­other one, this guy Te­bas must be so jeal­ous for the Premier League, English foot­ball...</p>
    <p>“Nor­mally, these kind of peo­ple, when the sen­tence is good for him, it’s per­fect but when the sen­tence is against, the prob­lem is for the other ones.”</p>
    <p>City have al­ready clinched sec­ond place in the league this sea­son, en­sur­ing Cham­pi­ons League foot­ball for the 10th year run­ning.</p>
    <p>With their three re­main­ing league matches, start­ing with to­day’s home game against strug­gling Bournemout­h, a mere for­mal­ity, Guardi­ola is ex­pected to shuf­fle the pack ahead of Satur­day’s FA Cup semi-fi­nal against Arse­nal.</p>
    <p>He is also think­ing about a con­tract ex­ten­sion amid the eu­pho­ria. “Maybe I will be able to stay here longer,” the 49-year-old, whose deal ex­pires next sum­mer, added.</p>
    <p>“Now, we have an in­cred­i­ble four or five weeks ahead. If we are good enough to beat Arse­nal, then we’ll play in the Cham­pi­ons League.”</p>
