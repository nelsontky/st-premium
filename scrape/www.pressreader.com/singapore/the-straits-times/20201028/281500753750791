    <p>When Mr Ig­natius Lim Buan Tie was in Tan­glin Pri­mary School, he strug­gled with English and Math­e­mat­ics and even­tu­ally failed those two sub­jects at the Pri­mary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tion (PSLE).</p>
    <p>He had to re­peat Pri­mary 6 be­fore mak­ing it to Presbyteri­an High School. There, he met a good English teacher, Ms Maggie Lim, who sparked his in­ter­est in read­ing by in­tro­duc­ing him to books that in­trigued him.</p>
    <p>“Books didn’t in­ter­est me back then, but she guided me and sug­gested books in the ad­ven­ture genre. From there, I be­gan to love read­ing,” said Mr Lim, 42, who is now an English teacher in Kheng Cheng School.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, he was one of seven teach­ers who re­ceived the In­spir­ing Teacher of English Award.</p>
    <p>An ed­u­ca­tor for 20 years, Mr Lim said: “The kind of strug­gle I had when I was learn­ing helped me to think about how I can make my stu­dents un­der­stand what I’m teach­ing.”</p>
    <p>He said it is im­por­tant for his young charges to find mean­ing in learn­ing and not just blindly mem­o­rise things like gram­mar rules and good vo­cab­u­lary.</p>
    <p>He added that he reg­u­larly ex­poses his pupils – he teaches Pri­mary 5 and 6 lev­els – to news­pa­per ar­ti­cles and on­line clips from The Straits Times and Chan­nel NewsAsia.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim, who also teaches Foun­da­tion English classes, said his child­hood ex­pe­ri­ence has taught him the im­por­tance of build­ing con­fi­dence in strug­gling learn­ers.</p>
    <p>He finds ways to help them learn to en­joy writ­ing, such as by teach­ing them phrases that are “good while easy to spell, con­nect and make sense in a story”.</p>
    <p>Words like “sud­denly” could be re­placed with “out of the blue”. An al­ter­na­tive for “scold­ing” would be “dress­ing down”.</p>
    <p>He paid tribute to a for­mer men­tor, Mrs Jessie Ching, who taught him var­i­ous teach­ing meth­ods. She was the school staff de­vel­oper at Mayflower Pri­mary School, where he taught from 2003 to 2009.</p>
    <p>Be­tween 2010 and 2016, he fur­thered his stud­ies and was also posted to the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion’s head­quar­ters. He has been teach­ing at Kheng Cheng School since 2016.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Lim: “What is im­por­tant to me as a teacher is that my stu­dents see mean­ing in their learn­ing and they can ap­ply what they learn.</p>
    <p>“I am a firm be­liever that ev­ery child can learn and im­prove, and I am glad to have the priv­i­lege of jour­ney­ing with my stu­dents in learn­ing to be ef­fec­tive users of English.”</p>
