    <p>Even from be­hind a mask, Lionel Yeo’s broad smile was dis­cernible.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has been a ma­jor dis­rup­tion to the plans the new chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of the Sin­ga­pore Sports Hub had hoped to carry out when he started work in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>But, in an in­ter­view with The Straits Times yes­ter­day, the 47-year-old for­mer pub­lic ser­vant is still filled with op­ti­mism that he can el­e­vate the Sports Hub to ful­fil its role as a “na­tional as­set”, while also striv­ing for com­mer­cial prof­its.</p>
    <p>It helped, he said, that he “came in with my eyes open on the chal­lenges and po­ten­tial” of the $1.33 bil­lion Sin­ga­pore Sports Hub.</p>
    <p>Yeo, who was chief of the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board from 2012 to 2018, is the fourth man to helm the Sports Hub after French­man Philippe Collin-Delavaud (March 2011-De­cem­ber 2015), and Sin­ga­pore­ans Manu Sawh­ney (Oc­to­ber 2015-May 2017) and Oon Jin Teik (Jan­uary 2018-April 2019).</p>
    <p>The chal­lenge of bal­anc­ing com­mer­cial in­ter­ests and the gov­ern­ment’s vi­sion for the Hub was re­port­edly a dif­fi­cult is­sue for his pre­de­ces­sors, and Yeo said he is well aware of this and up for the chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>He said: “I rep­re­sent the pri­vate sec­tor that op­er­ates and runs this space, and we are very mind­ful of our re­spon­si­bil­i­ties as stew­ards of this na­tional as­set, which means at the end of the day, we need to un­der­stand quite in­ti­mately and be aligned with what our stake­hold­ers are seek­ing from this as­set, and yet we have to make sure we are com­mer­cially sus­tain­able… it’s a very in­ter­est­ing bal­ance.”</p>
    <p>His ap­point­ment, an­nounced last Novem­ber, came on the back of a year where three se­nior man­age­ment staff – Oon, chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer Wong Lup Wai and chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer Sandy Tay – re­signed.</p>
    <p>Its chief com­mer­cial of­fi­cer, Adam Firth, left in Fe­bru­ary while chief ex­pe­ri­ence of­fi­cer Jacqueline Lau also de­parted this year.</p>
    <p>Yeo said that the Sports Hub has built a “strong” team since, who are “very en­er­gised” about what they can de­liver.</p>
    <p>“It’s im­por­tant for us to have that in­ter­nal co­he­sion, to en­sure we can ef­fec­tively en­gage ex­ter­nal stake­hold­ers,” he said. “Tal­ent re­ten­tion is an is­sue, but it’s also about how well we work as a team… (and) it’s some­thing I’ve been work­ing on.”</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has af­fected the Sports Hub’s op­er­a­tions acutely. Over­all foot­fall from Jan­uary to June de­clined 54 per cent from the same pe­riod last year, while event at­ten­dance saw an 85 per cent dip, with many in­ter­na­tional sports events, such as the HSBC Sin­ga­pore Rugby Sev­ens and hugely pop­u­lar In­ter­na­tional Champions Cup, forced to can­cel, and en­ter­tain­ment acts do­ing the same or post­pon­ing to next year.</p>
    <p>The cri­sis also saw the Sports Hub con­vert the Na­tional Sta­dium and</p>
    <p>We need to un­der­stand quite in­ti­mately and be aligned with what our stake­hold­ers are seek­ing from this as­set, and yet we have to make sure we are com­mer­cially sus­tain­able… it’s a very in­ter­est­ing bal­ance. ’’ LIONEL YEO, Sports Hub’s chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>OCBC Arena into tem­po­rary ac­com­mo­da­tion for mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>The unique sight of hun­dreds of pur­ple tents lined up across the sta­dium’s pitch pro­vided a sur­real back­drop to Yeo’s in­ter­view yes­ter­day. But this pivot to aid in the na­tional re­lief ef­forts, he said, has had “pos­i­tive con­se­quences” for the Sports Hub.</p>
    <p>He ex­plained: “It forced us, in a very short space of time, to have that in­ter­nal align­ment. I needed my fa­cil­i­ties part­ner, venue op­er­a­tions part­ner and cater­ing ser­vices part­ner to come in, and to­gether we worked with the gov­ern­ment (on) their re­quire­ments to de­liver the pro­ject.”</p>
    <p>The pan­demic is still rag­ing but Yeo has not lost sight of the need for the Hub to re­cover in a post-Covid world.</p>
    <p>“One en­cour­ag­ing thing is that we haven’t seen a lack of ap­petite from event pro­mot­ers and or­gan­is­ers,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Sev­ens is sched­uled for April while mu­si­cal acts Yoga Lin (Jan­uary), May­day (Fe­bru­ary), Green Day (April) have also pen­cilled in dates.</p>
    <p>And while he is un­sure if the global bat­tle against the pan­demic will im­prove by then to al­low the events to take place, Yeo said his team have been ex­plor­ing new ideas on stag­ing them.</p>
    <p>They have been work­ing on a “safe man­age­ment mea­sures over­lay” which could utilise the Sports Hub’s mul­ti­ple en­trance and exit points, and limit groups of spec­ta­tors to spe­cific zones.</p>
    <p>“We can cre­ate an ex­pe­ri­ence where peo­ple can come and at­tend a medium-to-large scale event, but they will min­gle with at most 50 or 100 peo­ple,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Is that some­thing that will work? That is what we are work­ing out.”</p>
    <p>Yeo, who en­joys hik­ing and trekking, and is also an avid run­ner, said el­e­vat­ing the Sports Hub as a premier sport­ing, en­ter­tain­ment and life­style des­ti­na­tion will de­pend on sat­is­fy­ing all his stake­hold­ers’ needs.</p>
    <p>He said: “In my mind, my start­ing point is this is a na­tional pro­ject… (and) we need all the stake­hold­ers to come to­gether and have align­ment in terms of what suc­cess looks like.</p>
    <p>“From my per­spec­tive, that needs to cover three ar­eas: pol­icy, com­mer­cial and pub­lic suc­cess… (and) pub­lic is as im­por­tant (as the oth­ers), if not more.</p>
    <p>“By that I mean – how do or­di­nary Sin­ga­pore­ans feel about the Sports Hub? What is the re­la­tion­ship the na­tional sports as­so­ci­a­tions have with Sports Hub?</p>
    <p>“If they don’t feel that we are rel­e­vant or that we are serv­ing their needs, then some­thing is miss­ing. These three el­e­ments need to come to­gether.”</p>
