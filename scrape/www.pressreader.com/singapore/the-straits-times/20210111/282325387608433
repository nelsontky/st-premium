    <p>•</p>
    <p>LON­DON Bit­coin just notched one of its best weeks on record, surg­ing about 40 per cent over the seven days to last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Any­one ex­pect­ing the no­to­ri­ously volatile dig­i­tal cur­rency to take a breather on week­ends had bet­ter buckle up.</p>
    <p>It is on Satur­days and Sun­days – when most other as­sets barely budge – that bit­coin tends to go par­tic­u­larly nuts. Take the first week­end of 2021. Com­ing off a 300 per cent gain last year, the world’s largest dig­i­tal coin rose as much as 14 per cent on Jan 2 and an­other 10 per cent the next day – a pe­riod when most of Wall Street was still in hol­i­day mode.</p>
    <p>Bit­coin is not alone in trad­ing all day, ev­ery day. What sets the coin apart is how big its price swings are out­side of es­tab­lished busi­ness hours.</p>
    <p>The cryp­tocur­rency’s week­end volatil­ity spikes are due to a cou­ple of fac­tors. One is that it is held by rel­a­tively few peo­ple – about 2 per cent of ac­counts con­trol 95 per cent of all avail­able bit­coin sup­ply. If these whales trade when vol­umes are thin, price swings will be mag­ni­fied. An­other is its mar­ket struc­ture, which con­sists of hun­dreds of dis­con­nected ex­changes that, in ef­fect, are their own is­lands of liq­uid­ity.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple al­ways tout bit­coin as 24/7, 365 liq­uid­ity, but what that ac­tu­ally means is you have pe­ri­ods of very thin liq­uid­ity,” said Mr Nic Carter, a part­ner at crypto-fo­cused ven­ture firm Cas­tle Is­land Ven­tures. “If you want to de­ploy US$500 mil­lion (S$663 mil­lion) of bit­coin, you prob­a­bly want to do it dur­ing core bank­ing hours.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Mr Greg Bunn, chief strat­egy of­fi­cer at dig­i­tal-as­set firm CrossTower, the mar­ket re­mains hugely frag­mented from an in­fra­struc­ture stand­point.</p>
    <p>Many plat­forms op­er­ate un­der dif­fer­ent stan­dards and with “dif­fer­ent philoso­phies”, he said. Yet, it lacks a cen­tralised mar­ket struc­ture akin to that of tra­di­tional as­sets, which tend to have com­mon means of cus­tody and set­tle­ment, for in­stance.</p>
    <p>Mr Bunn added: “If you think about the struc­ture, that makes it con­ducive to things that are go­ing to be very volatile and where you’re go­ing to have big moves. That’s ob­vi­ously go­ing to be im­pacted by when peo­ple are trad­ing, when peo­ple are awake, when peo­ple are watch­ing the mar­kets.”</p>
    <p>To Bi­nance.US’ Cather­ine Co­ley, bit­coin’s wild week­end pat­terns are rem­i­nis­cent of her time trad­ing cur­ren­cies in Hong Kong in the early 2010s. Volatil­ity some­times be­came sub­dued dur­ing lunchtime lulls and around hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sional traders, she said, tend to keep Mon­day-through-Fri­day sched­ules so it makes sense that liq­uid­ity – or how eas­ily an as­set can be traded – would wane on week­ends.</p>
    <p>If there are fewer buy­ers than sellers – or vice versa – then that makes trans­ac­tions harder, a sit­u­a­tion that usu­ally leads to ei­ther a spike or crash in prices.</p>
    <p>No one knows for sure and the­o­ries ex­plain­ing Bit­coin’s week­end ac­tion abound.</p>
    <p>Quan­tum Eco­nom­ics founder Mati Greenspan said that while in­sti­tu­tional play­ers have been in the spot­light re­cently, re­tail in­vestors could be re-en­ter­ing the space again, as well. They played a big role in bit­coin’s no­to­ri­ous 2017 run-up – and many got burned when it crashed the fol­low­ing year.</p>
    <p>Bit­coin trad­ing vol­ume has in­creased, hit­ting a record re­cently, with about US$80 bil­lion chang­ing hands on a weekly ba­sis, ac­cord­ing to data from re­searcher Mes­sari.</p>
    <p>“We’re break­ing through bar­ri­ers at break­neck speeds,” said Mr Greenspan. “This en­tire move from US$10,000 to US$40,000, this is mind-blow­ing and I’m say­ing this as some­one who wit­nessed 2013 and 2017 – it’s just much big­ger.”</p>
