    <p>Aries</p>
    <p>(March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Your easy way with words helps you make short work of al­most any prob­lem. At­tend to the right peo­ple, but once that is set­tled, it is all good.</p>
    <p>Taurus</p>
    <p>(April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>You feel some­what out of step, but there is noth­ing wrong with that. It may be un­com­fort­able, but things should get a lot bet­ter quickly.</p>
    <p>Gemini</p>
    <p>(May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>There is no need for you to dive into the de­tails – you can fol­low through an­other day. Use your en­ergy to en­list sup­port for your big plans.</p>
    <p>Can­cer</p>
    <p>(June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>You are strug­gling to make your­self un­der­stood, but it is not a sign of long-term is­sues. Oth­ers may not be lis­ten­ing, but it is not their fault.</p>
    <p>Leo</p>
    <p>(July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Peo­ple are likely to give you more in­for­ma­tion than you need, but you can sift through it later. Friends are valu­able even when over-shar­ing.</p>
    <p>Virgo</p>
    <p>(Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Make the most of your ter­rific men­tal en­ergy. You should be able to get peo­ple to see rea­son with­out too much ef­fort.</p>
    <p>Libra</p>
    <p>(Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Your mind is work­ing hard, so you can ex­pect some great ideas to start flow­ing later in the day. Be sure to share them.</p>
    <p>Scorpio</p>
    <p>(Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>That risk you took had costs, but you can af­ford them if you act wisely. Do not worry about the long run. The im­me­di­ate fu­ture needs at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s</p>
    <p>(Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>You are lost in thought, which can be delightful. How­ever, you do not have the in­for­ma­tion you need, so you have no de­fin­i­tive an­swers.</p>
    <p>Capricorn</p>
    <p>(Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>Speak out and make sure your voice is heard. If in­er­tia takes over, things could get dire, but you can save the day if you com­mu­ni­cate clearly.</p>
    <p>Aquarius</p>
    <p>(Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Your ro­man­tic en­ergy is great, so fo­cus on your love life. That could mean send­ing a gift to your sweetie or ask­ing out that hot­tie at work.</p>
    <p>Pisces</p>
    <p>(Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>You are a lit­tle over­whelmed. Just take things one at a time and see if you can get your friends or fam­ily to help you re­lax when it is all past.</p>
