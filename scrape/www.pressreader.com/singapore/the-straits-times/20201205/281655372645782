    <p>A Grab-Singtel con­sor­tium, one of two suc­cess­ful ap­pli­cants for a dig­i­tal full bank li­cence, has al­ready started hir­ing for around 200 po­si­tions in Sin­ga­pore that it in­tends to fill by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>About 10 per cent to 15 per cent of the roles in bank­ing, fin­tech and tech­nol­ogy have been filled.</p>
    <p>Most of the roles will see new hires, although Singtel and Grab em­ploy­ees are wel­come to join the new en­tity, the con­sor­tium’s new chief ex­ec­u­tive Charles Wong, who was for­merly Cit­i­group’s re­tail bank­ing head, said in a me­dia brief­ing last night.</p>
    <p>The con­sor­tium said it will cre­ate more op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans to take on tech and fin­tech roles, and will equip them with skills in ar­eas like cy­ber se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>The new en­tity will be­gin with a fo­cus on young pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians, gig work­ers and small busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>It aims to en­able them to eas­ily ac­cess trans­par­ent fi­nan­cial ser­vices in their ev­ery­day ac­tiv­i­ties, although it does not have con­crete plans yet about its fu­ture ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Grab and Singtel formed the con­sor­tium in De­cem­ber last year. Grab owns 60 per cent of it, while Singtel holds the re­main­ing stake. The con­sor­tium aims to for­mally launch the dig­i­tal bank in early 2022.</p>
    <p>Mr Arthur Lang, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Singtel’s in­ter­na­tional busi­ness, de­scribed the fi­nan­cial ser­vices space as a “grow­ing pie”, with the cir­cuit breaker and pan­demic lead­ing to more peo­ple get­ting used to dig­i­tal fi­nan­cial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>He added that the con­sor­tium is go­ing in with “eyes wide open”.</p>
    <p>“We are not go­ing in like the young start-up banks in other coun­tries, where they say they are out there to bring down the in­cum­bent banks. We are both laser­fo­cused on our cus­tomers and what we need to bring them joy and de­liver some­thing spe­cial.”</p>
