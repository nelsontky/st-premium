    <p>NEW YORK On­line sales in the United States surged on the tra­di­tional Black Fri­day to set the coun­try’s sec­ond-high­est one-day mark ever as virus-wary Amer­i­cans shunned in-per­son shop­ping.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can con­sumers, stay­ing home amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, spent US$9 bil­lion (S$12 bil­lion) on­line last Fri­day, a 21.6 per cent in­crease from the same day last year, the Adobe soft­ware firm re­ported on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>It said Fri­day’s sales were sur­passed only by those of last year’s Cy­ber Monday – the Monday af­ter Black Fri­day – when the fo­cus is on on­line sales. No­tably, some 40 per cent of sales were con­ducted over smart­phones, and many con­sumers sup­ported small busi­nesses. Their sales jumped by 545 per cent l ast Fri­day com­pared with the av­er­age day in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>“We an­tic­i­pate this week­end be­ing one of the big­gest e-com­merce events in his­tory, as con­sumers vote with their wal­lets and sup­port the in­de­pen­dent and di­rect-to-con­sumer busi­nesses they love,” said Mr Har­ley Finkel­stein, pres­i­dent of Cana­dian multi­na­tional e-com­merce firm Shopify.</p>
    <p>To­day, with the usual surge of Cy­ber Monday spend­ing am­pli­fied by the Covid-19 ef­fect, an­a­lysts are pre­dict­ing an all-time record. Sales are ex­pected to to­tal US$10.8 bil­lion to US$12.7 bil­lion, up by 15 per cent to 35 per cent.</p>
    <p>With more peo­ple work­ing from home, de­mand has surged for big­ger-ticket items such as com­put­ers and home fit­ness ma­chines.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Re­tail Fed­er­a­tion – point­ing to op­ti­mism over Covid-19 vac­cines, a strong stock mar­ket and dis­pos­able in­come that nor­mally would have gone to travel or en­ter­tain­ment – projects a jump of be­tween 3.6 per cent and 5.2 per cent in over­all hol­i­day sales this year from last year.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, con­sumer vis­its to phys­i­cal stores in the US de­clined by 52 per cent on Black Fri­day com­pared with a year ago due to so­cial dis­tanc­ing re­quire­ments, ac­cord­ing to pre­lim­i­nary data from Sen­sor­matic So­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, on­line rev­enue reached US$62.2 bil­lion, up 30 per cent from a year ago, said US cloud­based soft­ware firm Sales­force.</p>
    <p>Top cat­e­gories glob­ally were ap­parel and ac­ces­sories, health and beauty, and home and gar­den, Shopify said.</p>
    <p>In Europe, many re­tail­ers have of­fered pro­mo­tions through­out the month to spread out the de­mand.</p>
    <p>In France, Black Fri­day has taken on a po­lit­i­cal tone, with small shops com­plain­ing that gov­ern­ment-man­dated store clo­sures are gift­ing mar­ket share to Ama­zon.com. The fall­out re­sulted in Ama­zon and some of France’s big­gest re­tail­ers agree­ing to de­lay Black Fri­day un­til all stores re­open next month.</p>
