    <p>• Anthony Davis and LeBron James com­bined for 60 points as the top-seeded Los An­ge­les Lakers seized con­trol of their West­ern Con­fer­ence Fi­nals se­ries with a 114-108 vic­tory over the Den­ver Nuggets on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>James flirted with a triple-dou­ble be­fore fin­ish­ing with 26 points, nine re­bounds and eight as­sists. Fel­low All-Star Davis had 34 points as Lakers took a 3-1 lead in the be­stof-seven se­ries in the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion’s quar­an­tine bub­ble in Or­lando, Florida.</p>
    <p>The Lakers have wrapped up both their pre­vi­ous se­ries in five games and are one win away from their first NBA Fi­nals ap­pear­ance since win­ning the ti­tle in 2010.</p>
    <p>Cana­dian for­ward Ja­mal Mur­ray led the Nuggets with 32 points and eight as­sists but mis­fired on all three of his three-point at­tempts, while Jerami Grant fin­ished with 17 for Den­ver.</p>
    <p>Ser­bia’s Nikola Jo­kic was held in check most of the game and fin­ished with a dis­ap­point­ing 16 points. He missed all four field-goal at­tempts in the fourth quar­ter.</p>
    <p>James, who had the words “We want jus­tice” writ­ten next to Bre­onna Tay­lor’s name on his sneaker af­ter it was re­ported on Wed­nes­day that a Ken­tucky grand jury brought no charges against Louisville po­lice for the shoot­ing death of the woman, took it upon him­self to guard Mur­ray with the game on the line.</p>
    <p>“He’s is one of the hottest guys in the bub­ble,” said James. “He’s very shifty to guard. I just use my length and ath­leti­cism, high hand him and meet him at the bas­ket.”</p>
    <p>Den­ver have dug an­other big hole in th­ese play-offs and, if they are go­ing to ad­vance to the NBA Fi­nals, they will have to over­come a 3-1 deficit for the third straight se­ries af­ter come­backs against Utah and the Los An­ge­les Clip­pers.</p>
    <p>Ken­tavi­ous Cald­well-Pope had 13 points and Ra­jon Rondo tal­lied 11 points for the Lakers, who bounced back from Game 3’s loss.</p>
    <p>“We played with a lot of en­ergy tonight,” Lakers guard Cald­wellPope told TNT. “We had a lack of en­ergy start­ing Game 3... We kept a lead the whole game.”</p>
    <p>Rondo fin­ished with seven as­sists to pass Scot­tie Pip­pen for eighth place on the all-time play­off list. He had eight as­sists in Game 3 to sur­pass Kobe Bryant.</p>
    <p>“This is the West­ern Con­fer­ence Fi­nals, Game 4. If you can’t help us on the de­fen­sive end, maybe you shouldn’t be on the floor,” said Den­ver coach Michael Malone.</p>
    <p>“We have to be able to lock in, fin­ish with a re­bound. We had too many empty pos­ses­sions tonight.”</p>
