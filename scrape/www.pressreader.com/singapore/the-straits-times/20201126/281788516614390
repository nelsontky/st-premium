    <p>CNBG has said that its phase 3 tri­als – in­volv­ing more than 50,000 peo­ple in coun­tries from Ar­gentina to Egypt – have been pro­gress­ing smoothly, and it has not re­ceived any re­ports of se­ri­ous ad­verse events.</p>
    <p>BEI­JING • A lead­ing Chi­nese vac­cine de­vel­oper has ap­plied for au­tho­ri­sa­tion to bring its Covid-19 vac­cine to the mar­ket, seek­ing to get a jump on Western ri­vals as the race for a work­ing shot against the pan­demic en­ters the fi­nal stretch.</p>
    <p>China Na­tional Biotec Group (CNBG) has sub­mit­ted an ap­pli­ca­tion to Chi­nese reg­u­la­tors, re­ported state me­dia Xin­hua Finance yes­ter­day, cit­ing par­ent com­pany Sinopharm’s vice-gen­eral man­ager Shi Shengyi.</p>
    <p>The ap­pli­ca­tion likely in­cludes data from the com­pany’s phase 3 hu­man test­ing con­ducted in the Middle East and South Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>Stocks re­lated to Sinopharm Group, in­clud­ing its Hong Kong unit, surged yes­ter­day af­ter the news.</p>
    <p>A CNBG spokesman said she had no fur­ther in­for­ma­tion when con­tacted by Bloomberg. Calls to Sinopharm Group went unan­swered.</p>
    <p>With the ap­pli­ca­tion, CNBG will likely be­come the first de­vel­oper out­side of Rus­sia to see its shots made avail­able for gen­eral public use, un­der­scor­ing China’s de­ter­mi­na­tion to be a ma­jor player in sup­ply­ing in­oc­u­la­tions to coun­tries around the world.</p>
    <p>Western drug­mak­ers such as Pfizer are only at the stage of seek­ing au­tho­ri­sa­tion for emer­gency use of their shots, a sta­tus China granted to its devel­op­ers months ago. The race has taken on vi­tal im­por­tance as coun­tries look to more defini­tively re­open their economies and stem a pan­demic that has sick­ened over 59 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Work­ing vac­cines are seen as the best hope as a fresh wave of in­fec­tions is forc­ing na­tions to rein­tro­duce lock­downs and other re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>A state-owned drug­maker that has a dom­i­nant share of China’s vac­cine mar­ket, CNBG in April was among the world’s first to push ex­per­i­men­tal shots to the cru­cial fi­nal stage of hu­man test­ing.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s re­search in­sti­tutes de­vel­oped two shots us­ing an in­ac­ti­vated ver­sion of the virus to stim­u­late im­mune re­sponse, an ap­proach widely adopted by many of the ex­ist­ing vac­cines used around the world.</p>
    <p>De­spite the fact that the vac­cines have not yet re­ceived reg­u­la­tory ap­proval for wide­spread use, they have al­ready been given to hun­dreds of thou­sands of peo­ple in China un­der an emer­gency-use pro­gramme. That has raised con­cern among sci­en­tists of po­ten­tial risks in us­ing shots whose safety has yet to be thor­oughly stud­ied.</p>
    <p>CNBG has said that its phase 3 tri­als – in­volv­ing more than 50,000 peo­ple in coun­tries from Ar­gentina to Egypt – have been pro­gress­ing smoothly, and it has not re­ceived any re­ports of se­ri­ous ad­verse events.</p>
    <p>Safety has be­come a ma­jor con­cern as drug­mak­ers com­press the vac­cine de­vel­op­ment process from years to a mat­ter of months.</p>
    <p>As­traZeneca and John­son & John­son paused their tri­als af­ter a par­tic­i­pant de­vel­oped an un­ex­plained ill­ness. An­other Chi­nese front run­ner, Si­no­vac Biotech, also saw its trial briefly halted in Brazil af­ter a par­tic­i­pant died. All three tri­als re­sumed af­ter in­ves­ti­ga­tors found no ev­i­dence that the events were caused by the vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Pfizer said this month that the shot it co-de­vel­oped with BioNTech has a pro­tec­tion rate of more than 90 per cent. Rus­sia later de­clared that its Sput­nik V vac­cine has achieved a pro­tec­tion rate of 92 per cent. CNBG has not re­leased any public data on the ef­fi­cacy of its shots.</p>
