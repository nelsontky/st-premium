    <p>There were 166 deaths by sui­cide from Jan­uary to Septem­ber this year, down from 304 dur­ing the same pe­riod last year, Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs Des­mond Tan told Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He gave these pre­lim­i­nary fig­ures in re­sponse to Mr Mu­rali Pil­lai (Bukit Ba­tok), who asked how many sui­cides had been recorded and how many at­tempts at sui­cide the po­lice and Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force had in­ter­vened in since it was de­crim­i­nalised.</p>
    <p>Mr Mu­rali also asked how the de­crim­i­nal­i­sa­tion of at­tempted sui­cide had im­proved the sit­u­a­tion for those tempted to take their lives.</p>
    <p>At­tempted sui­cide was de­crim­i­nalised by the Crim­i­nal Law Re­form Act last year, with the amend­ments com­ing into ef­fect at the start of this year.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said yes­ter­day that the po­lice were called to help with about 1,800 cases of at­tempted sui­cide or thoughts of sui­cide from Jan­uary to Septem­ber this year.</p>
    <p>From 2017 to last year, the po­lice re­ceived about 1,200 re­ports of at­tempted sui­cide a year.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Tan pointed out that the two fig­ures can­not be com­pared as the 1,800 cases so far this year in­cluded peo­ple who had sui­ci­dal thoughts but did not ac­tu­ally act on them.</p>
    <p>He said: “The crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem is not the best way to deal with per­sons who have at­tempted sui­cide. Such per­sons are of­ten un­der se­vere dis­tress.”</p>
    <p>He added that the de­crim­i­nal­i­sa­tion of at­tempted sui­cide re­duces stigma and en­cour­ages sui­ci­dal peo­ple to seek help early.</p>
    <p>“The rea­sons for sui­cide are mul­ti­fac­eted and com­plex. Hence, the Gov­ern­ment has been con­tin­u­ing our ef­forts to pre­vent sui­cides, and we will con­tinue to mon­i­tor the sit­u­a­tion and ad­just our ap­proaches to bet­ter as­sist sui­ci­dal per­sons.”</p>
    <p>Dr Wan Rizal Wan Zakariah (Jalan Be­sar GRC) asked if men­tal health ser­vices in poly­clin­ics could be made open to walk-ins rather than based on ap­point­ments or re­fer­rals, in or­der to re­duce treat­ment de­lay.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Health Janil Puthuc­heary said peo­ple with men­tal health con­cerns who turn up at poly­clin­ics will be given a pre­lim­i­nary assess­ment by doc­tors.</p>
    <p>The poly­clinic doc­tors will also pro­vide ap­pro­pri­ate man­age­ment for those seek­ing help, in­clud­ing re­fer­ring them to men­tal health ser­vices if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Aside from poly­clin­ics, more than 220 gen­eral prac­ti­tion­ers have been trained un­der the Men­tal Health Gen­eral Prac­ti­tioner Part­ner­ship Pro­gramme to iden­tify, di­ag­nose and man­age those with men­tal health is­sues in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Dr Wan Rizal also asked what the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) had done to en­sure emo­tional and men­tal health well­ness at work­places.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Man­power Zaqy Mo­hamad said that aside from an ad­vi­sory on sup­port­ing the men­tal well-be­ing of work­ers un­der Covid-19 work ar­range­ments ear­lier this year, MOM will be re­leas­ing a tri­par­tite ad­vi­sory to guide em­ploy­ers on good work­place prac­tices to pro­mote work­ers’ men­tal well-be­ing later this year.</p>
    <p>He also high­lighted a num­ber of ex­ist­ing pro­grammes and re­sources that em­ploy­ers can tap, in­clud­ing the iWorkHealt­h on­line self-assess­ment tool to iden­tify com­mon work­place stres­sors.</p>
    <p>“MOM will con­tinue to work with our part­ners to ed­u­cate and gain the sup­port of em­ploy­ers to fur­ther pro­mote work­ers’ men­tal well-be­ing at the work­place,” he said.</p>
