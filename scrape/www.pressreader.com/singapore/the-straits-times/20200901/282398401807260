    <p>HONG KONG • Chi­nese in­vestors are scour­ing Hong Kong’s com­mer­cial prop­erty market for bar­gains af­ter prices plunged 30 per cent, sig­nalling a new wave of de­mand fol­low­ing anti-govern­ment protests last year that kept a lid on in­vest­ment ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Prop­erty agents ex­pect the in­flux of Chi­nese cap­i­tal, which has helped Hong Kong be­come one of the world’s most ex­pen­sive prop­erty mar­kets, can once again prop up the sec­tor as China re­cov­ers from the Covid-19 pan­demic and stands ready to de­ploy liq­uid­ity.</p>
    <p>Last month alone, main­land buy­ers snapped up at least two of­fice tow­ers and one ho­tel build­ing worth HK$4 bil­lion (S$702 mil­lion) in to­tal, ac­cord­ing to agents and fil­ings.</p>
    <p>“A ma­jor­ity of re­cent large-value build­ing deals were bought by Chi­nese in­vestors; their num­ber has re­ally grown in the third quar­ter,” said Mr Reeves Yan, head of cap­i­tal mar­kets at CBRE Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>“They’re look­ing for bar­gains... and they’re con­fi­dent in Hong Kong in the long term.”</p>
    <p>The pickup in de­mand co­in­cides with the im­po­si­tion of a na­tional se­cu­rity law in Hong Kong on June 30, which the au­thor­i­ties in Bei­jing and the fi­nan­cial cen­tre have said is nec­es­sary to en­sure its sta­bil­ity and pros­per­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Den­nis Cheng, se­nior sales di­rec­tor at Ri­ca­corp Prop­er­ties, said: “We ex­pect to see more main­land in­vestors com­ing to buy land.</p>
    <p>“If Hong Kong gets more sta­ble in the next few months af­ter the na­tional se­cu­rity law, we ex­pect more main­land com­pa­nies to open branches here, and that will help the of­fice sec­tor to re­cover.”</p>
    <p>The move by Chi­nese in­vestors is in stark con­trast to for­eign i nvestors, who are stay­ing away due to grow­ing con­cerns over the city’s fu­ture. Crit­ics of the new leg­is­la­tion say it has pushed the for­mer Bri­tish colony onto a more au­thor­i­tar­ian path fol­low­ing months of some­times vi­o­lent democ­racy protests last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Daniel Wong, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Mid­land IC&I, said: “For­eign in­vestors are still ab­sent. I spoke to two for­eign funds re­cently who said they won’t con­sider Hong Kong at the mo­ment be­cause the po­lit­i­cal risks are rel­a­tively high now.”</p>
    <p>In July, state-owned China Mo­bile and a con­sor­tium led by ma­jor Chi­nese de­vel­oper Vanke bought one land par­cel each for HK$5.6 bil­lion and HK$3.7 bil­lion, re­spec­tively. They were the first Chi­nese com­pa­nies to win pub­lic ten­ders since Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Col­liers says it ex­pects main­land cap­i­tal will be­come “the next wave of de­mand” in the Hong Kong leas­ing and in­vest­ment mar­kets, sup­ported by cross-bor­der fi­nan­cial ini­tia­tives in stock and wealth man­age­ment, and the city’s large cap­i­tal pool for fund-rais­ing.</p>
    <p>China called on its big­gest state firms to take a more ac­tive role in Hong Kong, in­clud­ing step­ping up in­vest­ment and as­sert­ing more con­trol of com­pa­nies to help cool last year’s po­lit­i­cal cri­sis, Reuters re­ported last year.</p>
    <p>It is un­clear, how­ever, whether the lat­est spike in in­vest­ment is be­ing driven by Bei­jing be­cause while some of the buy­ers are gov­ern­ment­backed, many of them are pri­vate in­vestors.</p>
    <p>But the city recorded a plunge in deal vol­ume amid the un­rest and the pan­demic, and has yet to wit­ness a rise in main­land in­vest­ments com­pa­ra­ble to a few years ago.</p>
    <p>Col­liers said in a re­cent note: “There are early signs of main­land Chi­nese de­mand re­turn­ing.”</p>
    <p>Chi­nese in­vest­ment ac­counted for 39 per cent of to­tal com­mer­cial real estate trans­ac­tions in Hong Kong so far this year, up from 19 per cent for the whole of last year, Col­liers said.</p>
