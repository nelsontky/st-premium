    <p>MI­AMI • Reign­ing Masters cham­pion Tiger Woods will not play in next week’s World Golf Cham­pi­onships event in Mem­phis so he can bet­ter pre­pare for the PGA Cham­pi­onship the fol­low­ing week.</p>
    <p>The 15-time Ma­jor win­ner re­vealed his plans on Fri­day af­ter shar­ing 40th place last week at the Me­mo­rial Tour­na­ment in his first PGA Tour start since Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>“Dis­ap­pointed to miss @WGCFedEx, but do­ing what I think is best to pre­pare me for the @PGACham­pi­onship and up­com­ing FedExCup Play­offs,” the 44-year-old tweeted.</p>
    <p>He has been care­ful about his sur­gi­cally re­paired back and knees in his lat­est come­back, which saw him emerge vic­to­ri­ous at Au­gusta Na­tional last year. It was his first Ma­jor tri­umph since 2008.</p>
    <p>The world No. 14 has cap­tured 82 Tour ti­tles af­ter win­ning the Zozo Cham­pi­onship last Oc­to­ber in Ja­pan, match­ing the ca­reer record set by Sam Snead.</p>
    <p>Since then, he has served as a player and cap­tain on the tri­umphant US team in De­cem­ber’s Pres­i­dents Cup, tied for ninth at Tor­rey Pines in Jan­uary and fin­ished 68th – last among those mak­ing the cut – at Riviera in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>He with­drew from events in March with back is­sues just be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic shut down the sea­son from March un­til June, but looked healthy in a made-forTV May char­ity ex­hi­bi­tion with Phil Mick­el­son and Na­tional Foot­ball League stars Tom Brady and Pey­ton Man­ning.</p>
    <p>Play­ing at the WGC St Jude In­vi­ta­tional and the PGA Cham­pi­onship in San Fran­cisco would have meant three starts in four weeks for Woods.</p>
    <p>Changes in the global golf sched­ule due to the pan­demic de­layed the PGA Cham­pi­onship from May un­til Aug 6-9 and made it the first Ma­jor to be con­tested this year.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish Open was can­celled, the US Open was de­layed from June to Septem­ber and the Masters moved from April to Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>In golf­ing ac­tion this week, Michael Thomp­son, the 2012 US Open run­ner-up, fired a five-un­der 66 to share the lead with Richy Weren­ski af­ter Fri­day’s sec­ond round of the PGA Tour’s 3M Open.</p>
    <p>Thomp­son, whose lone Tour ti­tle in 228 starts came at the 2013 Honda Clas­sic, matched Weren­ski (67) on 12-un­der 130 af­ter 36 holes at TPC Twin Cities in Min­nesota.</p>
    <p>Weren­ski made his best 36-hole PGA Tour start, one stroke lower than his first two rounds at the 2018 Mayakoba Clas­sic.</p>
    <p>Tony Finau (66) and Talor Gooch (65) shared third on 131, one stroke back, with China’s Zhang Xin­jun fifth on 132 af­ter a sec­ond-round 67.</p>
