    <p>Lo­cal banks are introducin­g more loan prod­ucts pegged to the Sin­ga­pore Overnight Rate Av­er­age (Sora), which is fast be­com­ing the new bench­mark in­ter­est rate.</p>
    <p>Sora – the av­er­age rate of un­se­cured overnight in­ter­bank Sin­ga­pore dol­lar trans­ac­tions bro­kered in Sin­ga­pore – is a back­ward-look­ing mea­sure.</p>
    <p>This is seen as more sta­ble than the two for­ward-look­ing term rates com­monly used: the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­bank Of­fered Rate and the Sin­ga­pore Swap Of­fer.</p>
    <p>United Over­seas Bank (UOB) and prop­erty gi­ant Cap­i­ta­Land have signed a two-year $200 mil­lion term loan pegged to both Sora and the Se­cured Overnight Fi­nanc­ing Rate (SOFR).</p>
    <p>The dual-tranche loan is the first of its kind in Sin­ga­pore, UOB and</p>
    <p>Cap­i­ta­Land said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The in­ter­est on the two tranches will be based on the com­pounded av­er­ages of the daily Sora and SOFR, both cal­cu­lated in ar­rears, and with re­spec­tive ap­pli­ca­ble mar­gins.</p>
    <p>The loan fa­cil­ity comes ahead of a global tran­si­tion from In­ter­bank Of­fer Rates, in­clud­ing the Lon­don In­ter­bank Of­fer Rate, to al­ter­na­tive risk-free rates.</p>
    <p>Al­ter­na­tive risk-free rates are overnight in­ter­est rate bench­marks based on ac­tual trans­ac­tions and are seen as more trans­par­ent and re­flec­tive of mar­ket con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>UOB and Cap­i­ta­Land aim to en­hance mar­ket con­fi­dence in adopt­ing Sora.</p>
    <p>“This is in line with the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore’s (MAS) ini­tia­tives to sup­port the adop­tion of Sora as a key in­ter­est rate bench­mark and the de­vel­op­ment of ro­bust Sora mar­kets,” they added.</p>
    <p>DBS Bank launched a So­rapegged busi­ness prop­erty loan yes­ter­day that it said was the first in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>It pro­vides busi­ness prop­erty own­ers with ad­di­tional fi­nanc­ing op­tions and cov­ers all real es­tate loan types.</p>
    <p>The loan is tai­lored for small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) look­ing to fi­nance com­mer­cial and in­dus­trial prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>In­ter­est rates will be based on the three-month com­pounded Sora pub­lished by the MAS, as well as an ap­pli­ca­ble mar­gin.</p>
    <p>SME own­ers can bor­row up to 80 per cent of their prop­erty value and choose to stretch their re­pay­ment tenor to up to 25 years.</p>
    <p>Last month, DBS launched the agribusi­ness in­dus­try’s first Sorabased loan, as well as the in­dus­try’s first Sora loan cou­pled with an in­ter­est rate swap.</p>
