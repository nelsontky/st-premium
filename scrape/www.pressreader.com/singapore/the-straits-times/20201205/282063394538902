    <p>Veera Pandiyan The Star, Malaysia</p>
    <p>Daily num­bers of Covid-19 in­fec­tions have reached quadru­ple dig­its, in­creas­ing to a to­tal of 56,659 with 337 deaths as of Nov 23.</p>
    <p>Even from as early as at the end of May, when there were just 7,762 Covid-19 cases in the coun­try, for­eign work­ers had made up 78 per cent of the in­fected.</p>
    <p>At that time, the di­rec­tor-gen­eral of health, Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham Ab­dul­lah, said this was be­cause of the con­fined and crowded spa­ces they lived in, where they were not able to prac­tise phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>There was also a so­lu­tion in place then: the Work­ers’ Min­i­mum Stan­dards of Hous­ing and Ameni­ties Act 1990, which is aimed at im­prov­ing the liv­ing con­di­tions of mi­grant work­ers. It was passed by the De­wan Rakyat in July last year and the amend­ments were gazetted a month later.</p>
    <p>Un­der the law, em­ploy­ers are com­pelled to pro­vide de­cent ac­com­mo­da­tion for work­ers and seg­re­gate hous­ing ac­cord­ing to gen­der. They also need to en­sure em­ploy­ees’ safety and well-be­ing, the safety of electrical wiring sys­tems, and pro­vide med­i­cal as­sis­tance when­ever needed.</p>
    <p>The Act was sup­posed to come into force on June 1 but on May 27, the Hu­man Re­sources Min­istry gave em­ploy­ers a grace pe­riod of three months – un­til Aug 31 – to meet the strin­gent re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>As soon as the dead­line was an­nounced, the Malaysian Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion asked for more time – at least six months – to com­ply with the re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>But a week into Septem­ber, it sought an­other ex­ten­sion, this time for a year. Iron­i­cally, the steep rise in the num­ber of for­eign work­ers af­flicted by Covid-19 was given as the ex­cuse to de­lay the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the law.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, the num­ber of cases in­volv­ing for­eign work­ers in fac­to­ries, con­struc­tion sites and, to a lesser ex­tent, food out­lets, has been grow­ing ex­po­nen­tially.</p>
    <p>With an es­ti­mated 36 per cent of doc­u­mented for­eign work­ers in the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor, 24 per cent in agri­cul­ture and 19 per cent in con­struc­tion, the sit­u­a­tion can only get worse.</p>
    <p>In­stead of de­lay­ing the en­force­ment of the Work­ers’ Min­i­mum Stan­dards of Hous­ing and Ameni­ties Act 1990, the gov­ern­ment should push for its im­ple­men­ta­tion as soon as pos­si­ble and en­cour­age the use of ef­fi­cient build­ing tech­nolo­gies for work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
