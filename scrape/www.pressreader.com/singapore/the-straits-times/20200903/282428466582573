    <p>•</p>
    <p>NEW YORK Andy Mur­ray has made an art form out of play­ing on the edge and counter-punch­ing his way out of dan­ger.</p>
    <p>That tal­ent was on full dis­play on Tues­day at the US Open, as the Scot flirted with elim­i­na­tion and some­how pulled out a 4-6, 4-6, 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-4), 6-4 win in a nearly five­hour match with Yoshi­hito Nish­ioka of Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>“I’m tired,” the 33-year-old Mur­ray said af­ter­wards. “My toes are the worst.”</p>
    <p>Get­ting into a marathon slug-fest with Nish­ioka was a ter­ri­ble idea for the three-time Grand Slam cham­pion, who is still early in his sin­gles come­back from hip re­place­ment surgery.</p>
    <p>Com­ing back from a ca­reerthreat­en­ing in­jury as the for­mer world No. 1 is try­ing to do is al­ways a fraught, risky en­deav­our. That is es­pe­cially the case now, with the coro­n­avirus pan­demic dis­rupt­ing ten­nis and so many other sports.</p>
    <p>Nor­mally, he would play a se­ries of smaller tour­na­ments to sharpen his game against lesser com­pe­ti­tion, gain rank­ings points and then hope­fully get­ting seeded at a Ma­jor.</p>
    <p>That would pro­tect him from top op­po­nents for a round or two.</p>
    <p>But with the ten­nis world on hia­tus from March un­til last month, there was lit­tle op­por­tu­nity for Mur­ray to play him­self into Grand Slam form.</p>
    <p>Would he still be fast enough to cover the court? Could he last five sets af­ter so much time away from Grand Slam ten­nis?</p>
    <p>The early an­swers – yes, and yes, at least against the world No. 49.</p>
    <p>This was Mur­ray be­ing so Mur­ray, car­ry­ing on that high-vol­ume di­a­logue with him­self through­out, spray­ing flat back­hands, top­spin lobs and the soft drop shots.</p>
    <p>Crowds are hard to come by at the US Open this year – fans have been banned from at­tend­ing – but Mur­ray man­aged to at­tract one, with world No. 1 No­vak Djokovic, seen in the seats of Arthur Ashe Sta­dium.</p>
    <p>“It’s rare you have lots of play­ers watch­ing your match,” said Mur­ray, who saved a match point in the fourth set.</p>
    <p>He will have to re­cover quickly as his next op­po­nent could be Cana­dian 15th seed Felix Auger-Alias­sime. He said his first job was to try and find an ice bath.</p>
    <p>“They have one in the locker room but that’s sup­posed to be for an emer­gency. This is an emer­gency,” he said.</p>
    <p>In the women’s draw, Ser­ena Wil­liams earned her 102nd sin­gles vic­tory at Flush­ing Mead­ows, the most of any player, male or fe­male, with a 7-5, 6-3 vic­tory over fel­low</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can Kristie Ahn.</p>
    <p>Her last Slam ti­tle came at the 2017 Aus­tralian Open and while she has been in four Ma­jor fi­nals since, the 38-year-old has yet to equal the all-time record of 24 ti­tles.</p>
    <p>Asked about the pos­si­bil­ity of go­ing level with Aus­tralian great Mar­garet Court, she claimed that it was “not the time to be fo­cused on records”, but in­stead con­grat­u­lated US Open or­gan­is­ers for man­ag­ing to pull off the event amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“The morale can be re­ally low in the world with ev­ery­thing that’s go­ing on. Some­times, you just want to take your mind off,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple have been do­ing that for gen­er­a­tions through sport. That’s one of the rea­sons I was so sup­port­ive of the US Open.”</p>
    <p>Her sis­ter Venus, mak­ing her 22nd US Open ap­pear­ance, fell at the first hur­dle to Karolina Mu­chova of the Czech Repub­lic 3-6, 5-7.</p>
    <p>Bel­gium’s Kim Cli­jsters, mak­ing the sec­ond come­back of her ca­reer and her first ap­pear­ance at a Grand Slam since 2012, also bowed out. She lost to Rus­sia’s Eka­te­rina Alexan­drova 6-3, 5-7, 1-6.</p>
