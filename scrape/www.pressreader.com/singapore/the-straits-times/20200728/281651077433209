    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s po­lit­i­cal sys­tem will have to evolve to ac­com­mo­date the elec­torate’s de­sire for greater di­ver­sity of views in pol­i­tics, while still main­tain­ing co­he­sion and a sense of na­tional pur­pose, said Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
    <p>He noted in a speech yes­ter­day that the new Par­lia­ment will have 12 op­po­si­tion MPs – the largest num­ber in re­cent his­tory.</p>
    <p>“The elec­tion has shown a strong de­sire among Sin­ga­pore­ans for greater di­ver­sity of views in pol­i­tics,” PM Lee said. “Vot­ers want the PAP to form the Govern­ment, but they also want more ro­bust debate of poli­cies and plans. This trend is here to stay. We have to give ex­pres­sion to it.”</p>
    <p>He was speak­ing at the swear­ing-in of the new Cabi­net and po­lit­i­cal of­fice-hold­ers, which was held in two sep­a­rate lo­ca­tions – the Is­tana and Par­lia­ment House.</p>
    <p>PM Lee said he looks for­ward to “more vig­or­ous but con­struc­tive de­bates in Par­lia­ment”.</p>
    <p>There are now 10 Work­ers’ Party MPs from Alju­nied and Sengkang GRCs, as well as the sin­gle-mem­ber con­stituency of Hougang.</p>
    <p>There are also two Non-Con­stituency MPs from the Progress Sin­ga­pore Party, which re­ceived 48.32 per cent of the vote in West Coast GRC.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment will for­mally des­ig­nate WP chief Pri­tam Singh as Leader of the Op­po­si­tion, and pro­vide him with staff and re­sources to per­form his role.</p>
    <p>“I hope our col­leagues across the aisle will step up to play their role of a re­spon­si­ble and loyal op­po­si­tion,” PM Lee said.</p>
    <p>“Their duty is not merely to raise crit­i­cisms and ask ques­tions of the Govern­ment, nec­es­sary as these func­tions are. But also, more im­por­tantly, to put for­ward se­ri­ous pol­icy al­ter­na­tives to be scru­ti­nised and de­bated.”</p>
    <p>This way, vot­ers will be able to bet­ter un­der­stand the is­sues, choices and trade-offs, he added.</p>
    <p>In the process, poli­cies and plans can be im­proved to de­liver bet­ter out­comes for Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>PM Lee also said that the Govern­ment has to ful­fil the broader am­bi­tions that Sin­ga­pore­ans have for the coun­try, be­yond eco­nomic pros­per­ity.</p>
    <p>“We as­pire to be a fair and just so­ci­ety, with op­por­tu­ni­ties for all. We wish to fash­ion an in­clu­sive com­mu­nity, where we look out for one an­other, reach out to those who need help and show ev­ery Sin­ga­porean that they have a stake in our fu­ture,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We want to make this a home where Sin­ga­pore­ans al­ways be­lieve that their chil­dren will have bet­ter lives than them­selves, and the hu­man spirit can flour­ish. This is the na­tion we are building to­gether.”</p>
    <p>He added: “To achieve these hopes and dreams, our po­lit­i­cal sys­tem must con­tinue to work well for Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
