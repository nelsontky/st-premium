    <p>Nine or­gan­i­sa­tions have joined an ex­pand­ing net­work that helps the home­less as ef­forts are ramped up to find more shel­ter space for those rough­ing it in the midst of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The new ad­di­tions to the Part­ners En­gag­ing and Em­pow­er­ing Rough Sleep­ers (Peers) net­work in­clude char­i­ties and re­li­gious groups such as Charis Methodist Church and Hope Ini­tia­tive Al­liance.</p>
    <p>Their in­clu­sion this month to the net­work the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment set up in July last year comes as de­mand for ser­vices to help rough sleep­ers is ex­pected to con­tinue to rise even as Sin­ga­pore en­ters phase three of its re­open­ing, said Mr Eric Chua, Par­lia­men­tary Sec­re­tary for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment, on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“What we’re try­ing to do is to re­ally make a clar­ion call to or­gan­i­sa­tions that might be able to step up to be part of the Peers net­work.”</p>
    <p>He was speak­ing on the side­lines of an out­reach ses­sion by the Catholic Wel­fare Ser­vices (CWS), which saw Min­is­ter-in-charge of So­cial Ser­vices In­te­gra­tion Des­mond Lee, who is also the Min­is­ter for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment, and CWS staff dis­trib­ute bags packed with toi­letries, food and drinks to those sleep­ing in the streets in the Bras Basah area.</p>
    <p>Mr Chua said the min­istry is work­ing hard to find new tem­po­rary sleep­ing shel­ters, also known as safe sound sleep­ing places.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, it was re­ported that the 21 tem­po­rary shel­ters cur­rently avail­able were mostly full, with about 100 peo­ple on the wait list.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of tem­po­rary shel­ters had ex­panded to more than 40 dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, but was re­duced when the or­gan­i­sa­tions had to re­sume the pri­mary use of the space.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pre­vi­ously said that the eco­nomic fall­out from Covid-19 had con­trib­uted to the higher num­ber of home­less peo­ple, with some hav­ing lost their jobs and oth­ers find­ing it tough to af­ford rent. There are also those left in limbo here af­ter travel re­stric­tions pre­vented them from re­turn­ing to their homes over­seas.</p>
    <p>Mr Chua on Fri­day noted that rough sleep­ing is likely a man­i­fes­ta­tion of more com­plex so­cial prob­lems, so it is important that the Peers part­ners ex­tend help by al­low­ing the rough sleep­ers to have a sta­ble en­vi­ron­ment so they can get back on their feet.</p>
    <p>Among those who re­ceived a bag of ne­ces­si­ties was a 75-year-old kitchen helper who wanted to be known only as Mr Yeo. He had just re­turned to his sleep­ing spot in the city af­ter work when the group ar­rived. Mr Thomas Tan, chair­man of the night mis­sions com­mit­tee at CWS, said: “We see it as a mis­sion to help our less for­tu­nate broth­ers and sisters.”</p>
