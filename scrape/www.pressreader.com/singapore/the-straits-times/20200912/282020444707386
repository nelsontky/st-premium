    <p>In­dia’s Covid-19 cases con­tinue to climb, even as the econ­omy tanks. China is press­ing for­ward on the two coun­tries’ dis­puted Hi­malayan bor­der, where dozens of In­dian sol­diers have been killed. Tax rev­enues have plum­meted, state govern­ments are un­happy and 21 mil­lion of In­dia’s rare salaried jobs van­ished in the past few months.</p>
    <p>And yet Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi – who re­cently posted pic­tures of him­self feed­ing pea­cocks in his serene gar­den – re­mains as pop­u­lar as ever. How does he do it?</p>
    <p>While they have re­sponded to the coronaviru­s in dif­fer­ent ways, many of his fel­low pop­ulists are strug­gling. Mex­ico’s Pres­i­dent An­dres Manuel Lopez Obrador (Amlo), faced with crash­ing poll num­bers, flatly re­fuses to be­lieve they are true. Mul­ti­ple mis­steps have brought Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son’s Tories prac­ti­cally level with Labour in some re­cent Bri­tish polls. Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin’s United Rus­sia party is fac­ing a tough set of lo­cal elec­tions.</p>
    <p>And, of course, there’s US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, whose re-elec­tion cam­paign seems to be based largely on pre­tend­ing the pandemic doesn’t ex­ist.</p>
    <p>Mr Modi seems to un­der­stand some­thing that the oth­ers do not about the re­la­tion­ship be­tween a pop­ulist leader and vot­ers.</p>
    <p>In a cri­sis, you can, like Brazil’s Pres­i­dent Jair Bol­sonaro, push your num­bers up tem­po­rar­ily through cash trans­fers. Or you can, like Turkey’s Pres­i­dent Re­cep Tayyip Er­do­gan, use iden­tity politics to dis­tract peo­ple from your bun­gles; that’s be­ing tried in In­dia as well.</p>
    <p>But there’s another fac­tor that Mr Modi ex­ploits to the hilt. The most adept pop­ulist lead­ers do not only de­tach the elec­torate’s per­cep­tion from in­con­ve­nient facts, pro­vid­ing an al­ter­na­tive nar­ra­tive in which they, and they alone, are the stars.</p>
    <p>To re­peat that trick in the face of dis­as­ters like a re­ces­sion or a pandemic, they also need to act. They have to make the sort of big de­ci­sions around which their sup­port­ers can con­struct a con­vinc­ing nar­ra­tive: a de­ci­sion that comes across as brave, or stern, or wise, or fa­therly or, ide­ally, all of those things.</p>
    <p>When Mr Modi, with just a few hours’ no­tice, with­drew 86 per cent of In­dia’s cur­rency in Novem­ber 2016, it was un­ques­tion­ably a dis­as­ter. Peo­ple lost jobs and liveli­hoods, eco­nomic growth was mor­tally in­jured and, given that all the money even­tu­ally re­turned to cir­cu­la­tion, none of the ex­er­cise’s goals were ac­tu­ally met.</p>
    <p>What Mr Modi learnt from the ex­pe­ri­ence, how­ever, is that it does not mat­ter whether the de­ci­sion you make pans out or not. All that mat­ters is that peo­ple be­lieve that you did some­thing big, some­thing that only you would dare to do, and that you did it for the best rea­sons.</p>
    <p>That’s what many In­dian vot­ers thought about “de­mon­eti­sa­tion”: If the gam­bit did not work, it was ev­ery­body else’s fault. At least he tried to stamp out cor­rup­tion, his sup­port­ers said, do­ing some­thing no other prime min­is­ter in In­dia’s his­tory, no other world leader had done. (For good rea­son.)</p>
    <p>Just months af­ter de­mon­eti­sa­tion, while In­di­ans were still suf­fer­ing from its af­ter-ef­fects, Mr Modi’s party won cru­cial polls in In­dia’s largest state.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tists Rikhil Bhav­nani and Mark Copelovitc­h dis­cov­ered that, in fact, Mr Modi’s party did rel­a­tively bet­ter in those ar­eas where peo­ple were hurt the most by de­mon­eti­sa­tion. Ap­par­ently, the worse the medicine tastes, the more the doc­tor must care about the dis­ease and want to cure it.</p>
    <p>When Mr Modi shut down the In­dian econ­omy in March in re­sponse to Covid-19’s ar­rival on its shores, he did so rel­a­tively early. In­dia’s was also per­haps the most dra­co­nian such shut­down glob­ally.</p>
    <p>While peo­ple suf­fered, every voter in every part of the coun­try knew that Mr Modi alone had shut the econ­omy down in re­sponse to the threat. By tak­ing ac­tion early and on the grand­est pos­si­ble scale, he es­sen­tially in­oc­u­lated his pop­u­lar­ity against the pandemic’s po­lit­i­cal ef­fects.</p>
    <p>No ri­val can now ac­cuse him of not do­ing enough and be be­lieved by vot­ers. The chances are that the de­ci­sion to go big will work out far bet­ter for lead­ers such as Mr Modi and the Philip­pines’ Ro­drigo Duterte, who also shut down hard, than deny­ing the pandemic will for oth­ers, from Amlo to Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>De­nial and de­lay was, in any case, the wrong course. Now the ef­fects of not act­ing are en­tirely on them. In In­dia, they’re on ev­ery­one else. If Covid-19 spreads, that’s be­cause bu­reau­crats, or state govern­ments, or the peo­ple them­selves failed to live up to the leader’s vi­sion.</p>
    <p>Some have hoped that the pandemic will cause vot­ers around the world to once again de­mand “com­pe­tence” from their lead­ers. That’s just wish­ful think­ing.</p>
    <p>The ev­i­dence from In­dia is that noth­ing has changed. The pop­ulist play­book is still ef­fec­tive, as long as it’s in hands as skilled as Mr Modi’s.</p>
