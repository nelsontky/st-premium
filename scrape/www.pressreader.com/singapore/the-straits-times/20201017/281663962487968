    <p>CHICAGO • The risk of ex­po­sure to the coro­n­avirus on flights is very low, a United States Depart­ment of De­fence study re­leased on Thurs­day found, a pos­i­tive sign for the air­line in­dus­try as it tries to re­bound from the pan­demic’s crush­ing ef­fect on travel.</p>
    <p>When a seated pas­sen­ger is wear­ing a mask, an av­er­age 0.003 per cent of air par­ti­cles within the breath­ing zone around a per­son’s head are in­fec­tious, even when ev­ery seat is oc­cu­pied, it found.</p>
    <p>The test­ing as­sumed only one in­fected per­son on the plane and did not sim­u­late the ef­fects of pas­sen­ger move­ment around the cabin.</p>
    <p>The study, con­ducted aboard United Air­lines Boe­ing 777 and 767 air­craft, showed that masks helped min­imise ex­po­sure to in­fec­tion when some­one coughed, even in neigh­bour­ing seats.</p>
    <p>About 99.99 per cent of par­ti­cles were fil­tered out of the cabin within six min­utes due to fast air cir­cu­la­tion, down­ward air ven­ti­la­tion and fil­tra­tion sys­tems on the air­craft.</p>
    <p>It es­ti­mated that to re­ceive an in­fec­tious dose, a pas­sen­ger would need to fly 54 hours on a plane with an in­fec­tious per­son.</p>
    <p>United, which also pro­vided pi­lots for the test, took pains to present the re­sults in its favour. “Th­ese re­sults... mean your chances of Covid ex­po­sure on a United air­craft are nearly non-ex­is­tent, even if your flight is full,” said its chief cus­tomer of­fi­cer Toby En­qvist.</p>
    <p>The study was led and funded by Trans­porta­tion Com­mand, which op­er­ates Pa­triot Ex­press flights that use com­mer­cial planes like</p>
    <p>United’s for mem­bers of the mil­i­tary and their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>The re­search over six months in­volved 300 tests over 38 hours of flight time and 45 hours of ground test­ing. Par­ti­cles the same size as the coro­n­avirus were re­leased across the cabin by sec­tion, each of which had 42 sen­sors rep­re­sent­ing pas­sen­gers who could po­ten­tially come in con­tact with the par­ti­cles.</p>
    <p>Each test re­leased 180 mil­lion par­ti­cles – the num­ber of par­ti­cles that would be pro­duced by thou­sands of coughs.</p>
