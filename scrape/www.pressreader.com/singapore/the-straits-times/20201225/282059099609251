    <p>Christ­mas, for me, is as­so­ci­ated with the spirit of for­give­ness, giv­ing and thanks­giv­ing. We have just been given a re­port card of how we fared over an un­prece­dented, tu­mul­tuous 12 months since the on­set of Covid-19 by Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong (We are see­ing light at the end of the tun­nel: PM Lee, Dec 15).</p>
    <p>De­spite the set­backs and mis­takes, our na­tion has ral­lied and to­day stands tall amid a global landscape that re­mains gen­er­ally dis­mal.</p>
    <p>I thank the of­fi­cers who worked tire­lessly to se­cure early ac­cess to the vac­cines and made it pos­si­ble for mass vol­un­tary vac­ci­na­tion of our cit­i­zens and long-term res­i­dents free of charge. In to­tal, no one can dis­pute that we have fared well.</p>
    <p>We should not to let our guard down, and re­main vig­i­lant and dis­ci­plined as the bat­tle against Covid-19 is far from over.</p>
    <p>But equally, if not more im­por­tant, with the spirit of Christ­mas very much alive, let us be thank­ful for the progress we have made. It adds to our so­cial cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>For those who have thrown brick­bats when things were not look­ing good, it is time to hon­our and ap­pre­ci­ate the many lead­ers, pub­lic of­fi­cers and front-line work­ers who have toiled hard and risked their lives to keep Sin­ga­pore safe.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic must not be­come a po­lit­i­cal foot­ball. Lives are at stake and we all de­sire to wish Sin­ga­pore well.</p>
    <p>As we move into phase three, do not be car­ried away by the cel­e­bra­tory mood, but think about what each of us can do for his fel­low cit­i­zens, es­pe­cially those suf­fer­ing be­cause of the pan­demic dur­ing this Christ­mas sea­son.</p>
    <p>Ge­orgie Lee Heng Fatt</p>
    <p>De­spite the set­backs and mis­takes, our na­tion has ral­lied and to­day stands tall amid a global landscape that re­mains gen­er­ally dis­mal.</p>
