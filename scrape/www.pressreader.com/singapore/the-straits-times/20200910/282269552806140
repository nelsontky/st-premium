    <p>NEW YORK • Ama­zon chief ex­ec­u­tive Jeff Be­zos topped Forbes’ list of rich­est Amer­i­cans for the third year in a row, while United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s rank­ing dropped as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic slammed his of­fice build­ings, ho­tels and re­sorts, the mag­a­zine said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The ag­gre­gate wealth of the Forbes 400 list rose to a record US$3.2 tril­lion (S$4.4 tril­lion), as the rich­est Amer­i­cans con­tin­ued to do well even though the pan­demic has dev­as­tated the econ­omy, which is short of about 11 mil­lion jobs com­pared with where it was in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Mr Eric Yuan, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Zoom Video Com­mu­ni­ca­tions, which has be­come ubiq­ui­tous in the work-from-home era, was one of 18 new­com­ers on the list, with a net worth of US$11 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s rank­ing dropped to No. 352 from No. 275 last year, and his net worth fell to US$2.5 bil­lion from US$3.1 bil­lion, as of­fice build­ings, ho­tels and re­sorts have suf­fered dur­ing the pan­demic. His Trump Or­gan­i­sa­tion owns prop­erty in all three cat­e­gories.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has long re­fused to re­lease his tax records.</p>
    <p>The an­nual list can serve as a way to track the wealth­i­est peo­ple in the coun­try who hold the most power, said Ms Kerry Dolan, as­sis­tant man­ag­ing ed­i­tor of wealth at Forbes, in an in­ter­view with Reuters TV.</p>
    <p>“As a so­ci­ety, we all should know who is be­hind the big­gest com­pa­nies and what they’re do­ing with their money,” she added.</p>
