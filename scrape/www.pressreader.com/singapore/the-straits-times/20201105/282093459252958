    <p>When At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Lu­cien Wong re­signed from the board of Cap­i­taLand in 2006, it was over dif­fer­ences of view­points on some is­sues with Mr Liew Mun Leong, who was then the pres­i­dent and chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of the listed real es­tate group.</p>
    <p>Given this his­tory, Mr Wong re­cused him­self from the At­tor­ney­Gen­eral’s Cham­bers’ (AGC) re­cent in­ter­nal re­view of the case in­volv­ing Mr Liew’s for­mer maid Parti Liyani.</p>
    <p>Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam yes­ter­day dis­closed this in Par­lia­ment as he stressed the re­views by the po­lice and the AGC have con­firmed that there was no im­proper in­flu­ence at any point in the case. “I can be cat­e­gor­i­cal; there was no in­flu­ence by Liew Mun Leong. It was treated as any other theft case and han­dled ac­cord­ingly,” the min­is­ter said.</p>
    <p>Ques­tions on pro­pri­ety had cropped up after Jus­tice Chan Seng Onn over­turned Ms Parti’s con­vic­tion on ap­peal and said in his judg­ment there was rea­son­able doubt about Mr Liew’s mo­tive for mak­ing a po­lice re­port against her.</p>
    <p>The re­la­tion­ship be­tween the A-G and Mr Liew came un­der scru­tiny par­tic­u­larly after the AGC an­nounced the A-G would not be in­volved in the re­view of the case.</p>
    <p>Some had sug­gested the two men were close as Mr Wong had been on Cap­i­taLand’s board.</p>
    <p>On why the A-G re­cused him­self from the AGC’s in­ter­nal re­view, the min­is­ter said: “The A-G felt that given the his­tory of dif­fer­ences he has had with Liew Mun Leong, the per­cep­tion of fair­ness may be af­fected if he over­saw the re­view.</p>
    <p>“Thus, the A-G had noth­ing to do with this case at any stage.”</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam said the de­ci­sion to pros­e­cute the maid was dealt with at the level of the deputy public prosecutor­s (DPPs) and their di­rec­tors, and the A-G did not know of the pro­ceed­ings about Ms Parti un­til the case went to trial.</p>
    <p>Set­ting out how such cases are han­dled, he said when the AGC re­ceives a file from the po­lice, prosecutor­s will as­sess whether or not to charge or if ac­tion has to be taken.</p>
    <p>This assess­ment and the de­ci­sions are usu­ally cleared by a di­rec­tor, and are not brought to the at­ten­tion of the deputy chief pros­e­cu­tor, chief pros­e­cu­tor, deputy A-G or A-G un­less they in­volve more se­ri­ous or sen­si­tive crimes, or where the A-G’s con­sent to pros­e­cute is ex­pressly re­quired. He added that nei­ther Mr Liew, his fam­ily mem­bers or any in­ter­me­di­aries had ap­proached the AGC on the case.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, the po­lice’s in­ter­nal re­view showed de­ci­sions on the case were taken by the in­ves­ti­ga­tion of­fi­cer (IO) and his im­me­di­ate su­per­vi­sor. “It didn’t come to the at­ten­tion of the se­nior man­age­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We have checked with the IOs, their su­per­vi­sor, the DPPs and their di­rec­tor,” he added. “There was no pres­sure or in­flu­ence ex­erted on them by Liew Mun Leong or any­one act­ing on his be­half, and they han­dled this case as they have han­dled other theft cases.”</p>
