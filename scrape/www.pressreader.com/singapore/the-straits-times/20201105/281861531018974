    <p>I urge all jour­nal­ists to stand fast on our val­ues and carry on our work with no fear and ’’ no favour.</p>
    <p>MS CHOY YUK-LING, after she was out on bail, hav­ing been ar­rested over a doc­u­men­tary she co-pro­duced in­ves­ti­gat­ing an at­tack on democ­racy sup­port­ers by gov­ern­ment loy­al­ists.</p>
    <p>HONG KONG • A Hong Kong jour­nal­ist was ar­rested on Tues­day in a probe linked to a re­cent doc­u­men­tary she co-pro­duced in­ves­ti­gat­ing an at­tack on democ­racy sup­port­ers by gov­ern­ment loy­al­ists, a move which her em­ploy­ers de­scribed as “chill­ing”.</p>
    <p>Public broad­caster RTHK said of­fi­cers searched pro­ducer Choy Yuk-ling’s home after her ar­rest.</p>
    <p>Po­lice con­firmed the op­er­a­tion on Tues­day evening, say­ing Ms Choy was ar­rested on sus­pi­cion of mak­ing an im­proper ap­pli­ca­tion to ac­cess car owner details.</p>
    <p>RTHK drew a di­rect link be­tween Ms Choy’s ar­rest and the in­ves­tiga­tive doc­u­men­tary she co­pro­duced. The film was about the “Yuen Long at­tack” – an as­sault in July last year by dozens of men armed with sticks on peo­ple re­turn­ing from a pro-democ­racy protest.</p>
    <p>“Like ev­ery­one else, I am also con­cerned that this will have a chill­ing ef­fect,” RTHK chief Le­ung Ka-wing told re­porters.</p>
    <p>Ms Choy was re­leased on bail late on Tues­day and said her ar­rest would af­fect “how ev­ery other jour­nal­ist in town is go­ing to re­port news in the fu­ture”.</p>
    <p>“I urge all jour­nal­ists to stand fast on our val­ues and carry on our work with no fear and no favour,” she told re­porters.</p>
    <p>The brazen as­sault in Yuen Long – a town close to the ru­ral bor­der with main­land China – and the po­lice’s fail­ure to re­spond quickly enough were a turn­ing point in last year’s huge and of­ten vi­o­lent prodemoc­racy protests, fur­ther ham­mer­ing public trust in the force.</p>
    <p>In a doc­u­men­tary ti­tled Who Owns The Truth? RTHK used footage filmed by wit­nesses and se­cu­rity cam­eras, searches of ve­hi­cle num­ber plates on a pub­licly avail­able database, and in­ter­views to piece to­gether what hap­pened that night.</p>
    <p>It un­cov­ered new details about the al­leged at­tack­ers, some of whom have links to po­lit­i­cally influentia­l ru­ral com­mit­tees that sup­port Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>It also said po­lice failed to re­spond to the build-up of stick­wield­ing men fer­ried into the district by spe­cific ve­hi­cles that evening hours be­fore the at­tack.</p>
    <p>While po­lice have ad­mit­ted not re­spond­ing quickly enough – ar­gu­ing that of­fi­cers were busy deal­ing with large-scale protests else­where – they have ve­he­mently de­nied any sug­ges­tion of col­lu­sion.</p>
    <p>Po­lice say they have ar­rested a num­ber of the at­tack­ers, some of whom have links to “triad” or­gan­ised crime gangs. Some at­tack­ers fled to the Chi­nese main­land.</p>
    <p>More re­cently, po­lice have ar­rested some of those at­tacked by the mob on ri­ot­ing charges.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong Jour­nal­ists As­so­ci­a­tion con­demned the ar­rest of Ms Choy.</p>
    <p>“Seek­ing the truth is the job of the me­dia,” the as­so­ci­a­tion said. “The search for li­cence plates is a com­mon in­ves­ti­ga­tion method used by re­porters.”</p>
    <p>Hong Kong main­tains a pub­licly ac­ces­si­ble li­cence plate database. It is of­ten used by jour­nal­ists for investigat­ions, in­clud­ing those work­ing for pro-Bei­jing news out­lets.</p>
    <p>Mod­elled on Britain’s BBC, RTHK is pub­licly funded but ed­i­to­ri­ally in­de­pen­dent of Hong Kong’s gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Its cov­er­age of last year’s huge protests sparked calls from leading pro-Bei­jing fig­ures to as­sert more con­trol over its out­put.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has since launched a re­view of RTHK, a move that crit­ics fear will hob­ble its in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>Un­like the Chi­nese main­land, where news is strictly con­trolled, semi-au­ton­o­mous Hong Kong has a vi­brant me­dia land­scape and hosts re­gional head­quar­ters for many in­ter­na­tional news out­lets.</p>
    <p>How­ever, its rep­u­ta­tion as a free press bas­tion is fad­ing. Since 2002, Hong Kong has fallen from 18th place in Re­porters With­out Bor­ders’ global press free­dom rank­ing to 80th this year.</p>
