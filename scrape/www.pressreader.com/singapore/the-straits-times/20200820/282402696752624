    <p>The Net­flix re­al­ity show In­dian Match­mak­ing has been a mas­sive hit in In­dia as well as the United States – the coun­tries that elite match­maker Sima Ta­paria jets be­tween as she at­tempts to ar­range mar­riages for young In­di­ans.</p>
    <p>But the se­ries has been con­tro­ver­sial, spark­ing a lively de­bate on so­cial me­dia and in the press about the dark side of ar­ranged mar­riage, which is the norm in In­dia.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause Ta­paria’s wealthy and picky clients and their fam­i­lies ap­pear pre­oc­cu­pied with po­ten­tial matches’ skin colour, height, so­cioe­co­nomic class and caste.</p>
    <p>And the at­ti­tudes of all in­volved, Ta­paria in­cluded, have been la­belled by many as out­dated and sex­ist.</p>
    <p>Yet in an e-mail interview with The Straits Times, Ta­paria and the show’s cre­ator and di­rec­tor, Smriti Mundhra, say their goal was to de­pict the process truth­fully, warts and all.</p>
    <p>Mundhra, who is based in Los An­ge­les, ac­knowl­edges that the in­sti­tu­tion of ar­ranged mar­riage is not with­out its prob­lems.</p>
    <p>But “the job of the show isn’t to sani­tise the world of match­mak­ing and ar­ranged mar­riage and make it seem more pro­gres­sive and in­clu­sive than it is”, says the In­di­anAmer­i­can film-maker, who was nom­i­nated for an Os­car for her doc­u­men­tary short St. Louis Su­per­man (2019), about rap­per-turned-politi­cian Bruce Franks Jr.</p>
    <p>“We tried to look at this tra­di­tion, which is so deeply rooted in our cul­ture, with nu­ance and through mul­ti­ple points of view, with­out deny­ing that a lot needs to change,” says the 39-year-old. “I hope the con­ver­sa­tions started by the show will help to pro­pel that change.”</p>
    <p>Ta­paria, who is de­scribed on the se­ries as “Mumbai’s top match­maker”, ob­serves that “there will al­ways be crit­i­cism”.</p>
    <p>“This is the way my work is and how my clients are – we have to be truth­ful,” says the 57-year-old, whose pithy ob­ser­va­tions on the show have gen­er­ated count­less memes.</p>
    <p>But, she adds, “the se­ries also showed some good things that have changed, like how i nde­pen­dent girls are now” – re­fer­ring to women on the show such as New Delhi fash­ion en­tre­pre­neur Ankita Bansal, whom Ta­paria ul­ti­mately failed to find a suit­able match for.</p>
    <p>Mundhra, too, be­lieves In­dian at­ti­tudes on love and mar­riage are evolv­ing.</p>
    <p>“I’ve spent most of my adult life grap­pling with the idea of ar­ranged mar­riage, both through per­sonal ex­pe­ri­ences and with my de­but doc­u­men­tary in 2017, A Suit­able Girl.</p>
    <p>“What does sur­prise me about the in­sti­tu­tion of mar­riage in In­dia is how much it is chang­ing. The change that is hap­pen­ing, es­pe­cially in In­dia, is rad­i­cal, so it will inevitably be messy and im­per­fect.</p>
    <p>“Still, it’s great that young peo­ple, es­pe­cially women, are push­ing back against old pa­tri­ar­chal ideals and de­mand­ing more agency in their lives, with­out deny­ing the very ba­sic hu­man need for com­pan­ion­ship and part­ner­ship,” says Mundhra, who was raised in both Los An­ge­les and Mumbai.</p>
    <p>She is also heart­ened by how nonIn­dian view­ers seem to have re­lated to the sto­ries on the show.</p>
    <p>“I think the show has taken off world­wide among non-In­di­ans be­cause it’s both re­lat­able and unique. And we had an amaz­ing cast that were will­ing to be open, hon­est and vul­ner­a­ble on cam­era.”</p>
    <p>In­dian Match­mak­ing also fills a gap in the genre.</p>
    <p>“There’s an in­her­ent in­ter­est in shows that ex­plore dat­ing, re­la­tion­ships and mar­riage be­cause they are top­ics that touch most of us, in one way or an­other, but we’ve never had a dat­ing show from the cul­tur­ally spe­cific per­spec­tive of In­di­ans,” Mundhra ob­serves.</p>
    <p>“The fact that it is from a point of view that’s not white and West­ern makes it dis­tinct from many other dat­ing shows, es­pe­cially in the US,” she adds.</p>
    <p>And while the pri­mary au­di­ence for the show is In­di­ans and the South Asian di­as­pora, “if it can give global au­di­ences a more nu­anced view of In­dian mat­ri­mony, be­yond child brides and forced mar­riage, that’s a good thing”.</p>
    <p>We tried to look at this tra­di­tion... with nu­ance and through mul­ti­ple points of view, with­out deny­ing that a lot needs to change. I hope the con­ver­sa­tions started by the show will help to pro­pel that change. ’’</p>
