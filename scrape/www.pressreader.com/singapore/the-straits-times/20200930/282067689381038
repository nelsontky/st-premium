    <p>It had all the qual­i­ties of a fairy-tale ro­mance to Cas­san­dra Tan (not her real name): meet­ing an el­i­gi­ble Amer­i­can-Chi­nese busi­ness­man on­line and fall­ing in love, with the promise of a happy-ever-after.</p>
    <p>But she was just be­ing led down the gar­den path. Over two years, Ms Tan, a clerk in her 50s, was not only cheated of $80,000 by her on­line “lover”, but she had also been ma­nip­u­lated into be­ing a money mule.</p>
    <p>She first met the man on Face­book in mid-2018. He claimed to be a 59-year-old Amer­i­can-Chi­nese busi­ness­man work­ing for “Kep­pel” and do­ing so over­seas.</p>
    <p>He pro­ceeded to spin tales, claim­ing, among other things, that his money had been “taken by the CIA”, and that he and his staff were “trapped at Cus­toms and needed money to get out”. He also sent im­ages of “him­self” in hos­pi­tal, feign­ing se­ri­ous med­i­cal emer­gen­cies.</p>
    <p>“I started fall­ing in love with him. I also took pity on him and wanted to help,” she said.</p>
    <p>This ruse went on un­til Oc­to­ber last year, dur­ing which Ms Tan trans­ferred $80,000 of her sav­ings to him over mul­ti­ple trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>But it was not over. The man asked her in May this year to al­low him to use her ac­count to pur­chase bit­coin cred­its. He made three trans­fers of $5,000 to her ac­count be­tween May and June, telling her to keep $500 each time she bought bit­coin cred­its on his be­half.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery trans­ac­tion, I kept $500 for my own us­age. As he owed me so much money, I thought it is only right for me to keep $1,500 for my­self,” Ms Tan said.</p>
    <p>The po­lice stepped in after they de­tected the sus­pi­cious trans­fers. It later came to light that she had not only been the vic­tim of an In­ter­net love scam, but was also be­ing made use of to laun­der il­le­gal monies.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan was one of 2,500 peo­ple in­ves­ti­gated be­tween Jan­uary and Au­gust this year for act­ing as money mules. In­ves­ti­ga­tions into her case have con­cluded, and she has been is­sued an ad­vi­sory.</p>
    <p>Deputy Su­per­in­ten­dent Jane Lim of the Com­mer­cial Af­fairs Depart­ment said: “When scam­mers forge re­la­tion­ships with their tar­gets and build trust over time, it be­comes easy to get some­one to give up their bank in­for­ma­tion or trans­fer funds.”</p>
    <p>The po­lice in sep­a­rate state­ments cited two cases in­volv­ing money mules. “Nel­son”, a 26-year-old Sin­ga­porean man, was sen­tenced to 10 months in jail for us­ing his bank ac­count to re­ceive $36,400 be­tween March and April 2017 via 27 bank trans­fers and cash de­posits. He be­came a money mule after procur­ing sex­ual ser­vices from an un­known wo­man on on­line clas­si­fieds web­site Lo­canto and sub­se­quently made mul­ti­ple cash trans­fers on be­half of a man said to be her “boss”. He con­verted $34,489.25 into Ali­pay cred­its for this “boss” over 63 trans­ac­tions. Nel­son then kept the bal­ance for his per­sonal use.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, ho­tel cleaner Noorhu­dah Sa’ad, 47, was sen­tenced to 22 months and three weeks’ jail over money laun­der­ing of­fences.</p>
    <p>She had been act­ing as a money mule for her on­line lover “Lucky Men­tus” and a friend known to her as “Lynn”, by with­draw­ing the funds re­ceived to hand to con­tacts in Sin­ga­pore or Malaysia.</p>
    <p>About $187,560, de­rived from var­i­ous busi­ness e-mail scams and In­ter­net love scams, was laun­dered in this way from De­cem­ber 2015 to Septem­ber 2016.</p>
    <p>DSP Lim cau­tioned against agree­ing to re­ceive or trans­fer any money on be­half of oth­ers, es­pe­cially if the sources of the funds are un­known. “Never share your one­time PIN, or al­low any­one to use your bank ac­count, e-wal­let, or cryp­tocur­rency ac­count, as you are re­spon­si­ble for all the trans­ac­tions made through your ac­counts.”</p>
    <p>For act­ing as a money mule to help a crim­i­nal re­tain ben­e­fits from il­licit ac­tiv­i­ties, one can be fined up to $500,000, jailed for up to 10 years, or both.</p>
