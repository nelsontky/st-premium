    <p>Uni­ver­sity ori­en­ta­tion season is here. Un­like in pre­vi­ous years, though, there are no loud, bois­ter­ous cheers or crowds of fresh­men on cam­pus grounds.</p>
    <p>In­stead, most fresh­men ori­en­ta­tion pro­grammes at the au­ton­o­mous uni­ver­si­ties here have moved on­line ow­ing to the Covid-19 pan­demic. Most are not com­pul­sory.</p>
    <p>The Sun­day Times ob­served one such vir­tual ses­sion at Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Uni­ver­sity (SMU) last Wed­nes­day, when a group of 12 fresh­men were hosted by two senior stu­dent fa­cil­i­ta­tors in a tele­con­fer­ence call on the We­bex plat­form.</p>
    <p>About 1,900 in­com­ing SMU stu­dents, out of a 2,300-strong co­hort, par­tic­i­pated in the on­line ori­en­ta­tion, which fea­tured pro­grammes such as games and we­bi­nars.</p>
    <p>Over 200 cur­rent stu­dent fa­cil­i­ta­tors, 30 stu­dent or­gan­is­ers and 20 staff train­ers were also in­volved.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the ses­sion that The Sun­day Times at­tended, the fresh­men were keen to find out more about is­sues such as SMU’s prac­tice of bid­ding for mod­ules.</p>
    <p>Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung also joined the group, tak­ing part in some games and chat­ting with the stu­dents. He told them: “One of the things I did before I left the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion... is (to en­sure) that when uni­ver­si­ties open, you can have 50 per cent to 60 per cent of foot­fall back in cam­pus, which I think is an im­por­tant thing to do.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause for young peo­ple, to stay at home and do on­line learn­ing is just not the same.</p>
    <p>“Uni­ver­sity is also re­ally about friend­ship, meet­ing peo­ple, and</p>
    <p>FRUIT­FUL SES­SION</p>
    <p>Before I came for the camp, I didn’t have high hopes. But my fa­cil­i­ta­tors and group mates are very en­gag­ing and I’m very lucky to be ’’ able to make friends with them.</p>
    <p>MR TER­RENCE SEOW, a fresh­man at Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Uni­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>some­times meet­ing your pro­fes­sors face to face, ask­ing ques­tions and ex­plor­ing queries that you have.”</p>
    <p>One of the group’s fa­cil­i­ta­tors, third-year ac­coun­tancy stu­dent Mikail Is­mail, said he took on a sim­i­lar role in last year’s phys­i­cal ori­en­ta­tion pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>It could be tougher to forge close and mean­ing­ful re­la­tions with the fresh­men with an on­line pro­gramme, the 22-year-old said.</p>
    <p>“But I’m hop­ing that once ev­ery­thing gets bet­ter, the school can and will pro­vide op­por­tu­ni­ties for them to get to know one another bet­ter, to have fun.”</p>
    <p>In­com­ing busi­ness man­age­ment stu­dent Ter­rence Seow, 23, said he en­joyed the we­bi­nars, adding that his two fa­cil­i­ta­tors did well in help­ing the group gel.</p>
    <p>“Before I came for the camp, I didn’t have high hopes. But my fa­cil­i­ta­tors and group mates are very en­gag­ing and I’m very lucky to be able to make friends with them,” he said.</p>
    <p>Other uni­ver­si­ties have come up with sim­i­lar vir­tual ori­en­ta­tion pro­grammes. The Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy (SIT) will be hold­ing a week-long one for its 2,800 fresh­men from Aug 24 to Sept 1.</p>
    <p>It will fea­ture vir­tual cam­pus tours at each of the six SIT cam­puses, as well as ac­tiv­i­ties such as hav­ing fresh­men meet­ing their re­spec­tive pro­gramme fac­ulty, se­niors and course mates via sched­uled Zoom ses­sions.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Uni­ver­sity of So­cial Sci­ences (SUSS) held sim­i­lar pro­grammes for its in­com­ing stu­dents last month, in­clud­ing live chat ses­sions with SUSS com­pe­ti­tion groups such as the swim­ming, track and field, and ten­nis teams.</p>
    <p>At the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore, fresh­man ori­en­ta­tion pro­grammes be­tween June 1 and Aug 7, in­clud­ing those con­ducted by halls, res­i­den­tial col­leges and res­i­dences, have been and will con­tinue to be con­ducted on­line.</p>
    <p>Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Uni­ver­sity also said its schools, res­i­den­tial halls and stu­dent or­gan­i­sa­tions are putting to­gether over 40 on­line tran­si­tion pro­grammes for some 6,000 fresh­men this month.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Uni­ver­sity of Tech­nol­ogy and De­sign, how­ever, is the only in­sti­tu­tion still plan­ning to have its phys­i­cal ori­en­ta­tion pro­gramme as sched­uled on Sept 10 and 11.</p>
    <p>In­terim provost Lim Seh Chun said the pro­gramme is de­signed with the cur­rent Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in mind and will ad­here to safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures. “Stu­dents will be di­vided into small groups with no cross min­gling be­tween groups... (but) if a face-to-face ori­en­ta­tion is (still) not pos­si­ble, we will en­deav­our to en­gage our new stu­dents vir­tu­ally.”</p>
