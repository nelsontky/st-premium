    <p>When peo­ple think of in­vest­ments, grow­ing their wealth first comes to mind, but, for Mr Alvin Yeo, build­ing his fi­nan­cial safety net is the first pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo, 38, a di­rec­tor of fi­nan­cial ser­vices at Great East­ern Fi­nan­cial Ad­vis­ers, beefs up his in­sur­ance and makes reg­u­lar con­tri­bu­tions to his Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) ac­counts to en­sure that he guards against worst-case sce­nar­ios.</p>
    <p>Af­ter that is ac­com­plished, he will then have peace of mind to fo­cus on grow­ing his pot of gold.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo, who has been with the in­surer for the past 14 years, now leads a team of 20 fi­nan­cial rep­re­sen­ta­tives.</p>
    <p>In­sur­ance has a per­sonal mean­ing to him, as his fa­ther suf­fered a heart at­tack a few months be­fore his grad­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“That helped me un­der­stand the im­por­tance of in­sur­ance as his medical bills were largely paid for,” said Mr Yeo, whose fa­ther was then 56 and a tax of­fi­cer. He had both a medical and crit­i­cal ill­ness plan plus ba­sic ElderShiel­d.</p>
    <p>His fa­ther was also di­ag­nosed with Parkin­son’s dis­ease a few years later and de­cided to re­tire early.</p>
    <p>“He was able to do that be­cause he had been a dis­ci­plined saver and owned both en­dow­ment poli­cies and stock in­vest­ments that helped him to fund his re­tire­ment,” added Mr Yeo.</p>
    <p>“His ex­pe­ri­ence has also shaped and strength­ened my be­lief in the work that I do, and this was one of the key rea­sons that made me de­cide to join the fi­nan­cial plan­ning industry,” he noted.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo, who grad­u­ated from Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity in 2006 with a bach­e­lor’s de­gree in business man­age­ment, is mar­ried to a 38-year-old ad­min­is­tra­tive ex­ec­u­tive. They have a four-year-old boy and a four-month-old girl.</p>
    <p>Q What’s in your port­fo­lio?</p>
    <p>A I re­cently fol­lowed a movement to have $1 mil­lion at 65 years old, so I started to trans­fer funds from my CPF Or­di­nary Ac­count to my Spe­cial Ac­count, and made fur­ther vol­un­tary top-ups to my Spe­cial Ac­count.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause pro­vid­ing a fi­nan­cial safety net is im­por­tant in fi­nan­cial plan­ning, es­pe­cially with the risk-free, guar­an­teed in­ter­est rates of­fered by the CPF.</p>
    <p>I in­vested 25 per cent of my in­vestable as­sets in in­sur­ance poli­cies, with the bulk in in­vest­mentlinked poli­cies. Such poli­cies of­fer flex­i­bil­ity that is use­ful when one needs to make ad­just­ments to one’s fi­nan­cial plan. They can also pro­vide the most value in terms of pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>I in­vested an­other 25 per cent of my as­sets in blue-chip stocks in the Straits Times In­dex dur­ing this Covid-19 down­turn. This was be­cause of stocks be­ing more af­ford­able given their lower prices.</p>
    <p>I have been con­tribut­ing to my Sup­ple­men­tary Re­tire­ment Scheme ac­count and bought var­i­ous unit trusts. I have also started buy­ing into funds man­aged by Van­guard and Di­men­sional Fund Ad­vi­sors dur­ing this pe­riod through a reg­u­lar sav­ings plan.</p>
    <p>I do this be­cause dol­lar-cost av­er­ag­ing is a tried and tested method of in­vest­ing and it also helps build a reg­u­lar habit of stay­ing in­vested and not spec­u­lat­ing in the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>In­sur­ance-wise, I have mort­gage in­sur­ance, death cov­er­age of $2.5 mil­lion and per­sonal ac­ci­dent cov­er­age of $1 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>I also have pri­vate hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion plans, crit­i­cal ill­ness and, more im­por­tant, dis­abil­ity in­come pro­tec­tion, which many peo­ple miss out on.</p>
    <p>I do not wish to bur­den my fam­ily and so my home will be paid up by the mort­gage in­sur­ance, while my fam­ily will have peace of mind know­ing they will be well taken care off should I be in­ca­pac­i­tated.</p>
    <p>Q What are your im­me­di­ate in­vest­ment plans?</p>
    <p>A My im­me­di­ate in­vest­ment plan is to make my fi­nan­cial ad­vi­sory business sus­tain­able. My agency is in this business for the long haul. Through Great East­ern, we have reg­u­lar train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties cov­er­ing prod­uct knowl­edge, reg­u­la­tory up­dates and skills in com­mu­ni­ca­tion, sales and lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>I have also en­gaged an ex­ter­nal con­sul­tant to pro­vide spe­cialised train­ing for my staff in the ar­eas of social me­dia mar­ket­ing.</p>
    <p>Q How did you get in­ter­ested in in­vest­ing?</p>
    <p>A My par­ents were or­di­nary em­ploy­ees but they were good savers. Set­ting aside enough money for not just a rainy day, but also a thun­der­storm, they pro­ceeded to buy bluechip stocks and held them for a long time.</p>
    <p>My business men­tors are also very ac­tive in­vestors and will share their ex­pe­ri­ence and help me see the big pic­ture. I be­lieve in be­ing pa­tient and stay­ing in­vested for the long haul and not to spec­u­late in the stock mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Q De­scribe your in­vest­ing strat­egy. A As a self-em­ployed per­son, I aim to es­tab­lish a ba­sic fi­nan­cial safety net by con­tribut­ing reg­u­larly to my</p>
    <p>CPF ac­counts. I be­lieve it is im­por­tant to know that one has enough funds to pro­vide a monthly pay­out when you are older and re­tired.</p>
    <p>It is im­por­tant to stay calm dur­ing the ups and downs of the stock mar­ket. It is use­ful to know the var­i­ous in­flu­ences or bi­ases that may impact you while in­vest­ing, from herd men­tal­ity to be­ing averse to loss.</p>
    <p>I re­bal­ance my port­fo­lio ev­ery six months. This is no dif­fer­ent from the reg­u­lar fi­nan­cial re­views that my agency con­ducts for our clients once ev­ery six to 12 months.</p>
    <p>Q What else is in your fi­nan­cial plan? A To use foot­ball anal­ogy, I like to set up my “de­fence” of in­sur­ance plan­ning first. Once I know the worst-case sce­nar­ios have been taken care of, I can con­cen­trate on go­ing on the “of­fen­sive”, such as grow­ing my business and ac­cu­mu­lat­ing wealth through in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>What is of­ten missed out is pro­vid­ing clar­ity to our loved ones in the event of our pre­ma­ture death. That is why I did my CPF nom­i­na­tion and also wrote my will. My wife is do­ing the same.</p>
    <p>I made my Last­ing Power of At­tor­ney to pro­vide clar­ity in the event I am men­tally in­ca­pac­i­tated. It al­lows my ap­pointed trusted ex­ecu­tors to make the nec­es­sary ar­range­ments for me on my medical and fi­nan­cial mat­ters.</p>
    <p>I am also re­view­ing my dis­abil­ity in­come pro­tec­tion es­pe­cially since CareShield Life will be launched this year. Dis­abil­ity can strike any­one, young or old. And if that hap­pens to me, I want to en­sure that my fam­ily’s stan­dard of liv­ing is main­tained.</p>
    <p>Just be­fore the birth of my sec­ond child, I made the de­ci­sion to in­crease my death cov­er­age first. This is be­cause if I were to die pre­ma­turely, the impact would be much larger, and I want to pro­vide as much as I can.</p>
    <p>My par­ents gifted us a small lump sum to buy en­dow­ment poli­cies for their grand­chil­dren. I made a copy of the cheque so that my chil­dren will re­mem­ber the name of their grand­par­ents and that they are the ones who will help fund their education.</p>
    <p>Q How are you plan­ning for re­tire­ment?</p>
    <p>A Rather than re­tire, I will prob­a­bly slow down and con­tinue to work to the best of my abil­i­ties. I find im­mense mean­ing and sat­is­fac­tion from the work that I do. As I am self­em­ployed, it is even more crit­i­cal that I set aside enough funds and be self-suf­fi­cient.</p>
    <p>Q Money­wise, what were your grow­ing-up years like?</p>
    <p>A My par­ents were both civil ser­vants. Both re­tired early due to their health. I have two younger broth­ers.</p>
    <p>We were a com­fort­able, mid­dlein­come fam­ily but my par­ents were very thrifty. In those days when my pri­mary school pocket money was $1, I spent 50 to 80 cents and put the un­used coins into tin cans.</p>
    <p>Af­ter my sav­ings reached the brim, I tried to shake the coins out so that I could play video games dur­ing the school hol­i­days. I re­alised that sav­ing money just to use it later was not re­ally sav­ing at all.</p>
    <p>I also worked part-time at Delifrance in my first year in Jurong Ju­nior Col­lege so that I could save and buy a BMX bi­cy­cle. I re­alised that what you earn with your hard work gives you a tremen­dous sense of sat­is­fac­tion.</p>
    <p>Q What does money mean to you?</p>
    <p>A When I was a young adult, I thought that money earned was a yard­stick to judge how well you have done in your ca­reer. But now, I re­alise that it is sim­ply a tool for us to pro­vide se­cu­rity for our loved ones and bring com­fort to those in need.</p>
    <p>Q Home is now...</p>
    <p>A A 1,259 sq ft, three-bed­der pri­vate con­do­minium in Sturdee Road.</p>
    <p>Q I drive...</p>
    <p>A A sec­ond-hand grey BMW X3. I just had a sec­ond child and de­cided that the size is just nice and the brand has been largely re­li­able.</p>
