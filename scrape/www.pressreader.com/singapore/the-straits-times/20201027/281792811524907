    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have com­plained of poor so­cial dis­tanc­ing and Deputy Health Min­is­ter Iraj Harirchi said that the pan­demic could cause</p>
    <p>600 daily deaths in com­ing weeks if Ira­ni­ans failed to re­spect health pro­to­cols in the Mid­dle East’s hard­est-hit coun­try.</p>
    <p>DUBAI • Iran ex­tended curbs in the cap­i­tal Te­heran and across the coun­try yes­ter­day as of­fi­cials said they were record­ing a death from Covid-19 ev­ery four min­utes.</p>
    <p>Some hos­pi­tals had run out of beds to treat new pa­tients, the head of the na­tional coron­avirus task force told state TV.</p>
    <p>“Our doc­tors and nurses are tired. I urge ev­ery­one to re­spect the pro­to­cols,” Mr Alireza Zali said.</p>
    <p>The health min­istry in the Mid­dle East’s hard­est-hit coun­try re­ported 337 new deaths and 5,960 new cases over the past 24 hours.</p>
    <p>A ban­ner on state TV said that amounted to a death ev­ery four min­utes.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have com­plained of poor so­cial dis­tanc­ing and Deputy Health Min­is­ter Iraj Harirchi said that the pan­demic could cause 600 daily deaths in com­ing weeks if Ira­ni­ans failed to re­spect health pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>Some ex­perts have doubted the ac­cu­racy of Iran’s of­fi­cial virus tolls.</p>
    <p>A re­port by the Ira­nian Par­lia­ment’s re­search cen­tre in April sug­gested that the Covid-19 tolls might be al­most twice as many as those an­nounced by the health min­istry.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s data took Iran’s to­tal death toll to 32,953 and the num­ber of iden­ti­fied cases to 574,856, Health Min­istry spokesman Sima Sa­dat Lari said.</p>
    <p>Schools, mosques, shops, restau­rants and other pub­lic in­sti­tu­tions in Te­heran have been closed since Oct 3.</p>
    <p>As cases and deaths con­tin­ued to hit record lev­els, the clo­sure was ex­tended un­til Nov 20, state TV re­ported.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials said “ex­treme mea­sures and lim­i­ta­tions” will be im­posed in at least 43 coun­ties across the coun­try for one week, where the in­fec­tion rates have been alarm­ing.</p>
    <p>State TV also re­ported that 21 one of Iran’s 31 prov­inces were on a coron­avirus red alert.</p>
    <p>Iran has blamed US sanc­tions for ham­per­ing the coun­try’s ef­forts to tackle the out­break.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton, ac­cus­ing Te­heran of “in­com­pe­tent and deadly gov­er­nance”, has re­fused to lift sanc­tions that were reim­posed af­ter 2018, when the United States ex­ited Iran’s 2015 nu­clear deal with six world pow­ers.</p>
