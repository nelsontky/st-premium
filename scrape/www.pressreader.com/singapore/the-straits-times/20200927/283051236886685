    <p>As Ms An­gel Sou puts it, she “stum­bled” into the fi­nan­cial tech­nol­ogy sec­tor with­out any prior ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>And now, nearly three years later, the 27-year-old has gained skills that are in de­mand else­where, even amid chal­leng­ing times.</p>
    <p>The op­er­a­tions man­ager at Sin­ga­pore-based fin­tech start-up Fi­naxar had to start from scratch, do­ing three months of on-the-job train­ing to un­der­stand the ins and outs of the boom­ing in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Her com­pany uses tech­nol­ogy to pro­vide loans for small busi­nesses and analy­ses data to as­sess the risks more ac­cu­rately.</p>
    <p>Be­fore ven­tur­ing into the fin­tech sec­tor, she had a brief stint at the fi­nance depart­ment of a fives­tar ho­tel af­ter grad­u­at­ing with a busi­ness de­gree from the Uni­ver­sity of Lon­don in 2015.</p>
    <p>She re­calls: “I stum­bled upon fin­tech (and) thought it was in­ter­est­ing. I wanted to learn new things.</p>
    <p>“It was chal­leng­ing at first. Af­ter all, it was a switch in in­dus­try.”</p>
    <p>Ms Sou, who en­sures loan trans­ac­tions to small and medium-sized en­ter­prises are in or­der, be­lieves there will be greater de­mand for fin­tech ex­per­tise in the near fu­ture, as Sin­ga­pore pushes to be a global fin­tech hub.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic’s grow­ing fin­tech scene has shown re­silience even as the econ­omy faces its worst down­turn amid the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of fin­tech firms has grown to over 1,000 this year, up from 600 last year, ac­cord­ing to the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Founded in 2016, Fi­naxar has clients from sec­tors rang­ing from lo­gis­tics to food and bev­er­age.</p>
    <p>While her firm has not been di­rectly af­fected by the pan­demic, Ms Sou says: “We are pru­dent in ac­cept­ing new clients be­cause of (it).”</p>
    <p>As with many tech start-ups, her job of­fers more flex­i­bil­ity, says Ms Sou, who has been work­ing from home for the past six months.</p>
    <p>“We can work any­where. We are not desk-bound.”</p>
    <p>Be­ing with the firm since its early years, she has seen its growth at first hand. The start-up has been able to stay nim­ble as it is a rel­a­tively flat or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Fi­naxar has 24 em­ploy­ees here, in­clud­ing de­vel­op­ers and sales per­son­nel. It also runs op­er­a­tions in Malaysia, Hong Kong and Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>“We started with a very lean team. Af­ter that, we ex­panded and car­ried more prod­ucts,” notes Ms Sou, adding that tech­nol­ogy has made her work more ef­fi­cient.</p>
    <p>It was a stark con­trast to her pre­vi­ous work­place, where she ro­tated around the dif­fer­ent fi­nance func­tions, in­clud­ing pro­cess­ing pay­rolls.</p>
    <p>“Then, it was more man­ual. We had a lot of pa­per doc­u­ments,” she says. “It is more ef­fi­cient now. Things can be done faster.”</p>
    <p>As the fin­tech scene con­tin­ues to grow, prac­ti­tion­ers like Ms Sou be­lieve they have to keep learn­ing or risk los­ing their com­pet­i­tive edge.</p>
    <p>This comes as the fast-paced sec­tor is con­stantly fac­ing new chal­lenges, re­quir­ing it to adapt and find quick so­lu­tions, says Ms Sou.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, new fi­nan­cial prod­ucts have to be cre­ated for firms to re­main com­pet­i­tive, and tech­ni­cal is­sues may crop up which they have to trou­bleshoot promptly.</p>
    <p>“We are al­ways look­ing for ways to in­no­vate,” she says.</p>
    <p>“There are new things to learn, even now.”</p>
    <p>START­ING FROM SCRATCH</p>
    <p>I stum­bled upon fin­tech (and) thought it was in­ter­est­ing. I wanted to learn new things. It was chal­leng­ing at first. Af­ter all, it was a switch in in­dus­try.</p>
