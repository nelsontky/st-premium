    <p>1 Res­cue ef­forts in Ore­gon</p>
    <p>Search-and-res­cue teams were de­ployed across the black­ened ru­ins of south­ern Ore­gon towns on Sun­day even as smoul­der­ing wild­fires con­tin­ued to rav­age the US Pa­cific Coast states after caus­ing wide­spread de­struc­tion. A blitz of wild­fires across Ore­gon, Cal­i­for­nia and Wash­ing­ton has de­stroyed thou­sands of homes and a half dozen small towns.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>TA­LENT (Ore­gon) Search-and-res­cue teams, with dogs in tow, were de­ployed across the black­ened ru­ins of south­ern Ore­gon towns on Sun­day even as smoul­der­ing wild­fires con­tin­ued to rav­age US Pa­cific Coast states after caus­ing wide­spread de­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>A blitz of wild­fires across Ore­gon, Cal­i­for­nia and Wash­ing­ton has de­stroyed thou­sands of homes and a half dozen small towns this sum­mer, scorch­ing over 1.6 mil­lion hectares and killing more than two dozen peo­ple since early Au­gust. More than 30,000 fire­fight­ers are bat­tling the blazes.</p>
    <p>Crews in Ore­gon’s Jack­son County were hop­ing to ven­ture into ru­ral ar­eas where the Almeda Fire has abated slightly with slow­ing winds, send­ing up thick plumes of smoke as the em­bers burned. From Med­ford through the neigh­bour­ing com­mu­ni­ties of Phoenix and Ta­lent, an apoc­a­lyp­tic scene of charred res­i­den­tial sub­di­vi­sions and trailer parks stretched for miles along High­way 99.</p>
    <p>Com­mu­nity do­na­tion cen­tres popped up around Jack­son County over the weekend, in­clud­ing one in the park­ing lot of Home De­pot in Phoenix, where farm­ers showed up with a pick-up truck bed full of wa­ter­mel­ons and peo­ple do­nated water and other sup­plies.</p>
    <p>Far­ther north i n Clacka­mas County, Mr Dane Valen­tine, 28, showed a Reuters jour­nal­ist the re</p>
    <p>mains of his house. “This is my home,” he said. “Yep. All gone.”</p>
    <p>Down the road, a woman with a Trump 2020 sign on her home, pointed a shot­gun at the jour­nal­ist and shouted at him to leave.</p>
    <p>“You’re the rea­son they’re set­ting fires up here,” she said, per­haps re­fer­ring to false ru­mours that the wild­fires were started by left-wing ac­tivists.</p>
    <p>After four days of bru­tally hot, windy weather, the weekend brought calmer winds blow­ing in­land from the Pa­cific Ocean, and cooler, moister con­di­tions that helped fire crews make head­way</p>
    <p>against blazes that had burned unchecked last week.</p>
    <p>Still, emer­gency of­fi­cials wor­ried that the shift­ing weather might not be enough to quell the fires.</p>
    <p>“We’re con­cerned that the in­com­ing front is not go­ing to pro­vide a lot of rain here in the Med­ford re­gion and it’s go­ing to bring in­creased winds,” Bureau of Land Man­age­ment spokesman Kyle Sul­li­van told Reuters on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>At least 10 peo­ple have been killed in Ore­gon, ac­cord­ing to the Of­fice of Emer­gency Man­age­ment. Ore­gon Gov­er­nor Kate Brown has said dozens of peo­ple re­main miss</p>
    <p>ing across three coun­ties.</p>
    <p>There were 34 ac­tive fires burn­ing in Ore­gon as of Sun­day morn­ing, ac­cord­ing to the web­site of the Of­fice of Emer­gency Man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Drought con­di­tions, ex­treme tem­per­a­tures and high winds in Ore­gon cre­ated the “per­fect firestorm” for the blazes to grow, Ms Brown, a Demo­crat, told CBS’ Face The Na­tion on Sun­day. “This is a wake-up call for all of us that we’ve got to do ev­ery­thing in our power to tackle cli­mate change,” she added.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump was set to travel to Cal­i­for­nia yes­ter­day to be briefed about the wild­fires while</p>
    <p>his Demo­cratic ri­val Joe Bi­den had planned a speech on the mat­ter from Delaware, bring­ing cli­mate change to the fore­front of the pres­i­den­tial campaign.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, a Repub­li­can who pulled the United States out of the Paris ac­cord on global warm­ing be­cause he found it too costly, has ex­pressed his view that poor for­est man­age­ment is partly to blame for the rag­ing fires.</p>
    <p>Democrats have em­pha­sised that cli­mate change has played a role, and Mr Bi­den was ex­pected to em­pha­sise that in his re­marks.</p>
