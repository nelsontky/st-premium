    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has claimed another slew of ca­su­al­ties in the food and bev­er­age (F&B) in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Of the five Vi­o­let Oon restau­rants, only three started op­er­at­ing again after dine-in re­sumed on June 19 dur­ing phase two of the econ­omy’s re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>Vi­o­let Oon Sin­ga­pore at Bukit Timah and Vi­o­let Oon Sa­tay Bar & Grill at Clarke Quay have re­mained closed. The out­let at Bukit Timah opened in 2012 and is the group’s old­est restau­rant. It spe­cialises in Per­anakan dishes. The sa­tay bar opened in 2017 and is pop­u­lar for its char­coal grills.</p>
    <p>The three that have re­opened are Vi­o­let Oon Sin­ga­pore out­lets in Ion Orchard and Jewel Changi Air­port, and Na­tional Kitchen By Vi­o­let Oon Sin­ga­pore at the Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore. They of­fer Sin­ga­pore her­itage food from Per­anakan, Eurasian, In­dian, Malay and Chi­nese cuisines.</p>
    <p>The restau­rant group is owned by food doyenne Vi­o­let Oon, her chil­dren Tay Yim­ing and Tay Su-Lyn, and busi­ness part­ner Manoj Mur­jani.</p>
    <p>Mr Mur­jani, who is the chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer, told The Sun­day Times: “Given the cur­rent chal­leng­ing en­vi­ron­ment and the un­cer­tain­ties of the fu­ture, we felt it was best to con­sol­i­date in three lo­ca­tions spread across Sin­ga­pore. As our lease was up for re­newal at Bukit Timah, we de­cided to not re­new. For Clarke Quay, we re­main un­de­cided and are mon­i­tor­ing the sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Another restau­rant that is not re­new­ing its lease is In­spirit House which opened at The Pung­gol Set­tle­ment three years ago. It closes its doors to­day. The fam­ilystyle restau­rant of­fers Western and Asian dishes such as BBQ ribs and Nonya sea bass.</p>
    <p>It an­nounced its fi­nal day on its Face­book page last month and is sell­ing off its fur­ni­ture and other items through Face­book Live this week­end.</p>
    <p>Another ca­su­alty is The Pel­i­can, an up­mar­ket Western seafood restau­rant at One Fuller­ton, which closed down on June 30 after eight years. Known for its seafood plat­ters and snap­per pie, it had a pop­u­lar outdoor al­fresco area on the Ma­rina Bay wa­ter­front.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Spanish restau­rant Don Qui­jote is say­ing good­bye to­day to Dempsey Hill, its home for the past 10 years. It will re­open next Sun­day at the 7th Mile Cof­fee Shop in Bukit Timah.</p>
    <p>Owner Ken Lim says the new premises are smaller and there is no air-con­di­tion­ing, but the rental is 75 per cent lower. He adds: “I did my cal­cu­la­tions on whether I should con­tinue at Dempsey and just didn’t think I could afford it.”</p>
    <p>The restau­rant will take over the space va­cated by 7th Mile Seafood, a zichar eatery also owned by Mr Lim, which closed down i n</p>
    <p>April. It seats up to 90, com­pared with 170 in Dempsey where there are pri­vate rooms and an al­fresco din­ing area.</p>
    <p>The menu will be about 30 per cent smaller. But pop­u­lar dishes such as squid ink paella and grilled items like tom­a­hawk and bar­ra­mundi will re­main.</p>
    <p>There will also be more bar­be­cued fare, says Mr Lim, be­cause the cof­fee shop kitchen can ac­com­mo­date a big­ger bin­chotan grill.</p>
    <p>Din­ers who miss the old dishes can still pre­order them. Mr Lim says he is not low­er­ing prices be­cause the food qual­ity will re­main the same. But he adds: “Ev­ery­thing is a lit­tle bit fluid be­cause we don’t know how long the pan­demic will last.”</p>
