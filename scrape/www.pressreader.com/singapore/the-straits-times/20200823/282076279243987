    <p>Some­where i n Ng Ser Miang’s wardrobe sits a polo tee with his name stitched on it, a pur­ple re­minder of a his­toric event a decade ago, when Sin­ga­pore hosted the in­au­gu­ral Youth Olympic Games (YOG).</p>
    <p>Like many among the pur­ple army of vol­un­teers who helped make the Games a suc­cess, Ng’s mem­o­ries of the event are vivid and un­blem­ished, just like the polo tee he wears ini­tially for this in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>The i dea for a youth-cen­tric Games that re­quired host ci­ties to use ex­ist­ing sports in­fra­struc­ture was first mooted by then-In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee (IOC) pres­i­dent Jac­ques Rogge, and one that Ng said was “made in heaven for Sin­ga­pore”.</p>
    <p>For the 71-year-old, who spear­headed Sin­ga­pore’s bid and or­gan­i­sa­tion of the YOG, the jour­ney had just be­gun.</p>
    <p>But first the team had to con­vince the Repub­lic’s lead­ers that Sin­ga­pore was ready to host it.</p>
    <p>Months be­fore the bid for the IOC, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong had told The Sunday Times that he felt Sin­ga­pore might not be ready to host the Games in 2010.</p>
    <p>But a day trip to Lau­sanne for a meet­ing with Rogge, and two ques­tions to Ng – who ex­plained the con­cept of the YOG to him – con­vinced the PM.</p>
    <p>“After the visit, PM was con­vinced, so he asked me, ‘If we bid, will we win, and if we win, can we do it?’ My re­ply was yes, and yes,” said the IOC vice-pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary 2008, Sin­ga­pore pipped Moscow to the rights to host the Games.</p>
    <p>For Ng, his re­ward for the next 30 months of hard work came days be­fore the open­ing cer­e­mony, when he handed the Youth Olympic torch to the late Min­is­ter Men­tor Lee Kuan Yew at a Ma­rina Bay event. Mr Lee had smiled at him and said: “Well done.”</p>
    <p>While the Aug 14-26 Games was hailed as a suc­cess, it was not with­out con­tro­versy as the to­tal bill of $387 mil­lion – over three times the ini­tial es­ti­mate of $104 mil­lion – came un­der fire from crit­ics.</p>
    <p>But Ng, who was chair­man of the or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee, be­lieves that the YOG was “worth every cent”, not­ing that the bulk of the costs was spent here on a “really iconic” event for Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The ini­tial es­ti­mate was “very low” and the num­bers changed as the con­cept was de­vel­oped, he said, with the open­ing cer­e­mony and “live” Games re­sults sys­tem also adding to the costs.</p>
    <p>He told ST: “We know that this fi­nal bud­get num­ber would draw some flak from peo­ple, but if you take it in the right per­spec­tive, what it has done for Sin­ga­pore, what is the worth of this event in terms of Sin­ga­pore’s im­age, at­tract­ing dif­fer­ent things after the Games, whether it’s in­vest­ment, tourism, sub­se­quent ma­jor events.</p>
    <p>“This is some­thing that was really iconic for Sin­ga­pore. The num­bers were there, to­tally jus­ti­fied and to­tally scru­ti­nised... it was worth every cent.”</p>
    <p>Since 2010, the YOG has trav­elled to Nan­jing (2014), Buenos Aires (2018) and the next edi­tion will be hosted in Dakar, Sene­gal. It was ini­tially slated for 2022 but was post­poned to 2026 ow­ing to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>And in the tur­bu­lent, dig­i­tally-ob­sessed world that youths are now grow­ing up in, Ng be­lieves that there is still a place for the YOG to in­spire and en­gage them through sport.</p>
    <p>He added: “It will con­tinue to be rel­e­vant be­cause it will con­tinue to en­gage the youth… YOG is al­ways ex­cit­ing be­cause there will al­ways be change.”</p>
