    <p>BARCELONA • The Green Cli­mate Fund (GCF) has promised de­vel­op­ing na­tions it will ramp up ef­forts to help them tackle cli­mate chal­lenges as they strive to re­cover from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, ap­prov­ing US$879 mil­lion (S$1.2 bil­lion) in back­ing for 15 new projects around the world.</p>
    <p>At a four-day vir­tual board meet­ing end­ing late last Fri­day, the fund added Afghanista­n and Su­dan to a list of more than 100 coun­tries re­ceiv­ing a to­tal of US$6.2 bil­lion to re­duce planet-heat­ing emis­sions and en­hance cli­mate re­silience.</p>
    <p>The GCF was set up un­der United Na­tions cli­mate talks in 2010 to help de­vel­op­ing na­tions tackle global warm­ing, and started al­lo­cat­ing money in 2015.</p>
    <p>Ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Yan­nick Gle­marec said the fund had “a key role to play to main­tain cli­mate am­bi­tion in the era of Covid-19” and would aim to im­prove the speed and ef­fi­ciency of its re­sponse to the needs of de­vel­op­ing coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Board co-chair Nau­man Bashir Bhatti, from Pak­istan, said cli­mate fi­nance would be cru­cial for re­cov­ery from the pan­demic and the fund needed to in­crease sup­port “even dur­ing these dif­fi­cult times”.</p>
    <p>Those prom­ises came as small is­land states crit­i­cised the pace and size of GCF as­sis­tance, say­ing they were now strug­gling with the eco­nomic blow from the pan­demic on top of cli­mate change im­pacts such as ris­ing seas and stronger storms.</p>
    <p>Fiji’s UN am­bas­sador Satyen­dra Prasad said Covid-19 risked wors­en­ing the al­ready high debt bur­den of small is­land na­tions, as tourism dived.</p>
    <p>“The im­por­tance of the (GCF)... in ac­cel­er­at­ing trans­for­ma­tive cli­mate ac­tion in this present decade can­not be un­der­stated,” he added.</p>
    <p>He told the Thom­son Reuters Foun­da­tion that is­land na­tions were strug­gling to ac­cess other sources of fi­nance and urged the GCF to boost aid to help them pre­pare project pro­pos­als and to re­lease fund­ing for ap­proved projects faster.</p>
    <p>The Al­liance of Small Is­land States, of which Singapore is a mem­ber, said its mem­bers rep­re­sented less than 10 per cent of to­tal fund­ing re­quests.</p>
    <p>The GCF l ast week ap­proved three new projects for is­land na­tions, in­clud­ing strength­en­ing build­ings to with­stand hur­ri­canes in An­tigua and Bar­buda, and in­stalling so­lar power sys­tems on farm­land on Fiji’s Ovalau is­land.</p>
    <p>It also gave the green light to pay­ments re­ward­ing re­duc­tions in de­for­esta­tion in Colom­bia and In­done­sia be­tween 2014 and 2016.</p>
    <p>But more than 80 green groups is­sued an open let­ter ahead of the meet­ing op­pos­ing such fund­ing.</p>
    <p>They said de­for­esta­tion had since spiked and coun­tries should not be re­warded for “pa­per re­duc­tions” in car­bon emis­sions cal­cu­lated from favourable base­lines.</p>
    <p>Ms Liane Scha­latek, who leads cli­mate fi­nance work for the Hein­rich Boll Foun­da­tion North Amer­ica, said the fund should take a hard look at whether the for­est emis­sion re­duc­tions it is pay­ing for would be per­ma­nent.</p>
    <p>It should also en­sure the fund­ing pro­tects and ben­e­fits for­est com­mu­ni­ties and in­dige­nous peo­ple, she told the Thom­son Reuters Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>Other new projects in­cluded one for zero-de­for­esta­tion co­coa pro­duc­tion in Ivory Coast, pro­vid­ing ru­ral vil­lages i n Sene­gal and Afghanista­n with so­lar mini-grids, and con­serv­ing bio­di­ver­sity on In­dian Ocean is­lands.</p>
    <p>The fund said ini­tia­tives like these would cre­ate jobs and sup­port a green re­cov­ery from the coro­n­avirus cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The board also ac­cepted Sene­gal’s La Banque Agri­cole and the United Na­tions In­dus­trial De­vel­op­ment Or­gan­i­sa­tion as part­ners that can im­ple­ment projects with fund money.</p>
    <p>But Ja­pan’s Su­mit­omo Mit­sui Bank­ing Cor­po­ra­tion put its ac­cred­i­ta­tion ap­pli­ca­tion on hold af­ter cam­paign­ers ar­gued that the GCF should not work with a com­pany that lends to de­vel­op­ers of coalpower plants, though it has ruled out back­ing new ones.</p>
