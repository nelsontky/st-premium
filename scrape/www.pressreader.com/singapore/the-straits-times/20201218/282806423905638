    <p>ROYAL CHRIST­MAS: The Duke and Duchess of Cam­bridge have shared a pho­to­graph of their fam­ily for their an­nual Christ­mas card.</p>
    <p>Prince Wil­liam, 38, sec­ond in line to the throne, is pic­tured with his wife Kate Mid­dle­ton, 38, and their three chil­dren – Prince Ge­orge, seven; Princess Char­lotte, five; and Prince Louis, two – look­ing re­laxed in sweaters and sit­ting with wide grins on a bale of hay in front of chopped fire­wood at their Am­ner Hall coun­try home in Eng­land.</p>
    <p>Younger son Louis sits front and cen­tre and steals the lime­light with a cheeky, mid-laugh grin.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Peo­ple.com, the cou­ple sent one of their cards to Bri­tain’s National Health Ser­vice (NHS), which in­cluded a hand­writ­ten mes­sage from Prince Wil­liam thank­ing the staff for their work dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“To all the amaz­ing NHS staff. We can never thank you enough for the ded­i­ca­tion and sac­ri­fices you have had to make this year. We will be for­ever grate­ful,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>The whole fam­ily also made a sur­prise ap­pear­ance at a pan­tomime per­for­mance at</p>
    <p>London’s Pal­la­dium The­atre ear­lier this month to thank es­sen­tial work­ers, mark­ing the chil­dren’s first pub­lic ap­pear­ance in months.</p>
    <p>“It is the least we could do to thank you for ev­ery­thing you do – day in, day out – to keep our coun­try safe and look af­ter those who need help the most,” Prince Wil­liam said in a speech be­fore the event.</p>
