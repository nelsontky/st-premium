    <p>Each Sin­ga­pore res­i­dent will be able to col­lect a pair of masks us­ing their gov­ern­ment-is­sued ID from Sept 21, in the lat­est na­tion­wide mask dis­tri­bu­tion ini­tia­tive by Te­masek Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>Do­mes­tic helpers and work­ers on work passes will also be able to col­lect the masks. Tod­dlers to 12-year-olds will be el­i­gi­ble for kid-size masks.</p>
    <p>Te­masek chief ex­ec­u­tive and ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Ho Ching made the an­nounce­ment on Face­book last night.</p>
    <p>“The Te­masek Foun­da­tion folks have been plan­ning this for some time, and were work­ing to make a for­mal an­nounce­ment be­fore this week­end,” Ms Ho said.</p>
    <p>The col­lec­tion of masks will span a two-week pe­riod, from Sept 21 till Oct 4.</p>
    <p>Ms Ho said there are am­ple sup­plies of white cloth masks and urged peo­ple to go af­ter the first three days to avoid the crowds.</p>
    <p>Those who want more masks, or who want masks in other colours, such as black, peach, denim blue and navy, can pre-or­der them on­line for a fee.</p>
    <p>The adult and kid white masks go for $8 per kit – con­tain­ing two masks – and you can pre-or­der up to a max­i­mum of 10 ex­tra kits per per­son.</p>
    <p>Navy masks also go for $8 per pair, capped at 10 kits per per­son, while masks in other colours are $10 per pair, capped at five kits per per­son.</p>
    <p>The pre-or­der pe­riod is from Sun­day till Oct 2.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ous rounds of mask dis­tri­bu­tion were con­ducted in June and July through some 1,200 vend­ing ma­chines at bus in­ter­changes, com­mu­nity cen­tres/ clubs and res­i­dents’ com­mit­tee cen­tres.</p>
    <p>This year’s Na­tional Day packs also con­tained face masks.</p>
