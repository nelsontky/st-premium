    <p>It is ironic that a golf course that has won world­wide ac­claim only re­cently should un­dergo an up­grade through ex­ten­sive ren­o­va­tion.</p>
    <p>Voted ‘Sin­ga­pore’s Best Golf Course’ for the sec­ond year in a row at the World Golf Awards back in Oc­to­ber and find­ing it­self reg­u­larly listed as one of the world’s highly-ranked golf cour­ses, Sen­tosa Golf Club’s The Serapong has a new look.</p>
    <p>An­drew John­ston, the club’s Gen­eral Man­ager, Di­rec­tor of Agron­omy and res­i­dent Golf Course De­signer, has the best an­swer for the up­grad­ing of a course that has be­come “the home” for the Sin­ga­pore Open and has staged many other ma­jor events.</p>
    <p>Said John­ston: “Be­ing lo­cated in a sub-trop­i­cal cli­mate means the golf course ages faster than an or­di­nary one, and th­ese ren­o­va­tions are cru­cial to main­tain­ing the qual­ity of the play­ing sur­faces, as well as the con­di­tions and high stan­dards that we pride our­selves on here at Sen­tosa, 365 days of the year”.</p>
    <p>The club to­day of­fi­cially reopens its world-class state-of-the-art cham­pi­onship course, head­lined by a new bunker­ing style with cre­ative, artis­tic ser­rated edges to en­hance its char­ac­ter and over­all strat­egy, whilst el­e­vat­ing the course to a new level on the world stage.</p>
    <p>The club used 6,000 tonnes of new sand dur­ing the ren­o­va­tions to re­in­state con­sis­tency, tex­ture and tour­na­ment ready com­paction for im­proved playa­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Mod­i­fi­ca­tions have also helped to en­hance and pre­serve the per­son­al­ity of many of The Serapong’s iconic holes, in­clud­ing the sig­na­ture fifth hole, which over­looks met­ro­pol­i­tan Sin­ga­pore and its bustling port.</p>
    <p>Mas­ter­minded by John­ston, The Serapong has been closed since March and, along­side the new bunker­ing, a num­ber of other key course up­grades were im­ple­mented dur­ing that time.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­cluded the re-grass­ing of fair­ways, re­ju­ve­nat­ing them with mi­nor grad­ing ad­just­ments and im­proved drainage strate­gies, as well as mod­i­fy­ing the greens soil pro­file by in­tro­duc­ing new car­bon tech­nol­ogy to boost soil chem­istry and pro­file struc­ture.</p>
    <p>En­hance­ments to the greens are set to make The Serapong’s putting sur­faces even bet­ter, which is hard to be­lieve given the wide ac­claim they al­ready re­ceive from its mem­bers, guests and vis­it­ing Tour Pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>The ren­o­va­tions also paid close at­ten­tion to the re-lev­el­ling of all tee boxes, re­in­stat­ing them with the his­toric table­top flat fin­ish The Serapong is renowned for. It will en­able the club to con­tinue to main­tain the tees at a super low mow­ing height of three mil­lime­tres, im­prov­ing the qual­ity of the play­ing ex­pe­ri­ence for mem­bers and guests.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing ahead of The Serapong’s re­open­ing, which is a soft launch ahead of a grand re­open­ing in March, John­ston said: “The last time The Serapong was ren­o­vated was nearly 14 years ago and since then the course has grown to be­come one of the world’s best, pick­ing up mul­ti­ple ac­co­lades in the process.</p>
    <p>“De­spite the chal­lenges pre­sented by the world­wide pan­demic, we have found a way to pull the Sen­tosa fam­ily to­gether within the safe work­ing re­stric­tions to com­plete the works.</p>
    <p>“This has been a very ex­cit­ing pro­ject that was well over­due, and we are con­fi­dent the changes im­ple­mented will only en­hance the golf­ing ex­pe­ri­ence for our mem­bers and guests.”</p>
    <p>Do­minic Wall, di­rec­tor, Asia-Pa­cific at The R&A, said: “The new­lyren­o­vated The Serapong looks great. It is fan­tas­tic see that, through­out the en­tire process of the ren­o­va­tions, the pro­ject con­tin­ued to align with the club’s ground-break­ing sus­tain­abil­ity agenda.”</p>
    <p>The Serapong was orig­i­nally de­signed by the world-fa­mous golf course de­sign firm Golf Plan and Ron­ald Fream, open­ing in 1982. The course was fur­ther ren­o­vated in 2006 by the Bates Golf De­sign Group, who were led at the time by their VP of De­sign and Con­struc­tion, An­drew John­ston, and whose de­signs have seen the course’s trade­mark con­tours, ex­tended stone­lined lakes and breath-tak­ing Sin­ga­pore har­bour back­drop be­come renowned across the world.</p>
    <p>The Serapong has played host to the Sin­ga­pore Open since 2005 (ini­tially Bar­clays Sin­ga­pore Open, then SMBC Sin­ga­pore Open from 2015).</p>
