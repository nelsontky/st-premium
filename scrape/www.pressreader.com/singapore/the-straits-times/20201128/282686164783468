    <p>• Chris­tian Cole­man has ap­pealed against his ban for breach­ing anti-dop­ing where­abouts rules, the Court of Ar­bi­tra­tion for Sport (CAS) an­nounced on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The CAS said it had reg­is­tered the ap­peal after he was banned for two years by the Ath­let­ics In­tegrity Unit’s (AIU) Dis­ci­plinary Tri­bunal last month. A date has not been set for the hear­ing.</p>
    <p>“In his ap­peal to the CAS, Chris­tian Cole­man re­quests that the de­ci­sion of the AIU Dis­ci­plinary Tri­bunal... be set aside and that the sanc­tion be elim­i­nated or, in the al­ter­na­tive, re­duced,” it said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Un­der the so-called where­abouts rule, elite ath­letes must make them­selves avail­able for ran­dom out-of-com­pe­ti­tion test­ing, and state a lo­ca­tion and one-hour win­dow where they can be found on any given day.</p>
    <p>Three fail­ures to prop­erly file where­abouts in­for­ma­tion or be­ing ab­sent dur­ing the hour stated in a 12-month pe­riod can re­sult in a one- or two-year sus­pen­sion.</p>
    <p>The world 100m cham­pion said at the time of his pro­vi­sional sus­pen­sion that anti-dop­ing of­fi­cials had not fol­lowed pro­ce­dure when he missed them after go­ing Christ­mas shop­ping last year at a time when he in­di­cated he would be at home.</p>
    <p>But dop­ing con­trol of­fi­cers tes­ti­fied that they were present dur­ing the whole of the al­lot­ted hour in front of his house.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can claimed he had ar­rived home from Christ­mas shop­ping shortly be­fore the end of the one-hour pe­riod. How­ever, shop­ping re­ceipts showed that he had pur­chased 16 items from a Wal­mart Su­per­centre on Dec 9 at 8.22pm, seven min­utes after the al­lot­ted hour was up.</p>
    <p>Should the ban re­main in place, the 24-year-old will miss next year’s Olympic Games in Tokyo, where he would have been among the favourites to win the 100m gold medal.</p>
    <p>Cole­man’s com­pa­triot and 2004 Athens Games gold medal­list Justin Gatlin did not com­pete in the Bei­jing Olympics four years later after in­cur­ring a four-year dop­ing ban, mak­ing him the last 100m cham­pion who did not de­fend his ti­tle.</p>
    <p>The CAS also said it had reg­is­tered an ap­peal re­lat­ing to world 400m cham­pion Salwa Eid Naser, with World Ath­let­ics con­test­ing the de­ci­sion of the AIU’s Dis­ci­plinary Tri­bunal to clear the Bahraini of com­mit­ting an an­ti­dop­ing rule vi­o­la­tion by miss­ing out-of-com­pe­ti­tion tests.</p>
