    <p>The Philip­pines yes­ter­day evac­u­ated close to a mil­lion peo­ple, as it braced it­self for the strong­est typhoon to hit any­where in the world this year.</p>
    <p>Typhoon Goni, known lo­cally as Rolly, is bear­ing down on the eastern part of the main is­land of Lu­zon, with winds of up to 295kmh, ap­prox­i­mat­ing the strength of Typhoon Haiyan that killed more than 6,300 peo­ple in Novem­ber 2013.</p>
    <p>“The strength of this typhoon is no joke,” Mr Gremil Naz, a lo­cal dis­as­ter of­fi­cial in Al­bay prov­ince, told ra­dio sta­tion DZBB.</p>
    <p>Goni is fore­cast to sweep through the same re­gions still reel­ing from the fury of an ear­lier storm, Typhoon Molave, which last week left 22 peo­ple dead, in­un­dated prov­inces in re­gions south of the cap­i­tal Manila, and caused at least 1.81 bil­lion pe­sos (S$51 mil­lion) in dam­age to farm­lands.</p>
    <p>Al­though Goni is ex­pected to weaken slightly when it makes land­fall in the eastern prov­inces of Catan­d­u­anes and Ca­marines early to­day and cut a path very close to Manila, it will still pack max­i­mum winds of about 250kmh.</p>
    <p>Typhoon alerts have been raised across Lu­zon and the eastern part of cen­tral Philip­pines. The weather bureau has warned of heavy rain, storm surges of up to 3m, floods and land­slides.</p>
    <p>Mr Ri­cardo Jalad, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the na­tional dis­as­ter agency, told a news con­fer­ence that about 794,000 peo­ple liv­ing in coastal and land­slide-prone com­mu­ni­ties in Al­bay had al­ready been evac­u­ated.</p>
    <p>Mr Don Cul­vera, a dis­as­ter re­sponse of­fi­cial, told the Philip­pine Daily In­quirer that close to 160,000 peo­ple in Ca­marines had left their homes for emer­gency shel­ters.</p>
    <p>In Manila and nearby Bu­la­can prov­ince, roughly 1,000 Covid-19 pa­tients housed in large iso­la­tion tents could be trans­ferred to ho­tels and hos­pi­tals, Mr Jalad said.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines has the sec­ond high­est Covid-19 in­fec­tions and deaths in South-east Asia, next only to In­done­sia, with 380,729 cases and 7,221 deaths.</p>
    <p>Many more peo­ple across south­ern Lu­zon have been ad­vised to get ready to evac­u­ate.</p>
    <p>State vul­ca­nol­o­gists, mean­while, have warned of pos­si­ble mud­flows from three ac­tive vol­ca­noes.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pine Red Cross said it has pre-po­si­tioned res­cue ve­hi­cles, first aid vol­un­teers, emer­gency re­sponse teams and re­lief items, and is also as­sist­ing com­mu­ni­ties ahead of the typhoon’s ex­pected land­fall.</p>
    <p>The Coast Guard has shut down more than a dozen ports, mostly in the Bi­col re­gion, leav­ing some 1,500 stranded.</p>
    <p>Mr Harry Roque, Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte’s spokesman, said the na­tion’s main dis­as­ter re­sponse agency is now on red alert, and the So­cial Wel­fare Min­istry has al­ready stock­piled re­lief goods and ear­marked re­lief funds worth some 870 mil­lion pe­sos.</p>
    <p>Goni is the third typhoon to hit the Philip­pines in three weeks. An­other storm, At­sani, is set to bear down on the ar­chi­pel­ago later this week.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines, the first ma­jor land­mass fac­ing the Pa­cific cy­clone belt, gets hit by an av­er­age of 20 storms and ty­phoons each year.</p>
    <p>The typhoon sea­son usu­ally starts in June and peters out by Novem­ber. But in re­cent years, the strong­est ty­phoons have been slam­ming the coun­try as the year draws to a close in Novem­ber and De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>Many more peo­ple across south­ern Lu­zon have also been ad­vised to get ready to evac­u­ate.</p>
