    <p>When her hus­band re­turned in June af­ter los­ing his job in Abu Dhabi amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, Mrs Sreedevi Ra­jen­dran took stock of how their fam­ily of five would man­age fi­nan­cially for the rest of the year.</p>
    <p>A week af­ter his re­turn, she cooked ghee rice and chicken for lunch. While her fam­ily mem­bers took a nap, she ar­ranged for a ma­jor gold loan com­pany to send an ex­ec­u­tive to her home.</p>
    <p>Within five days, and af­ter a 10-minute visit to a lo­cal branch, the house­wife had re­ceived a loan for 1 00,000 ru­pees (S$1,800) against her set of gold ban­gles.</p>
    <p>She used the money to buy a smart­phone for her son’s on­line classes and re­paid the in­ter­est on a bank loan.</p>
    <p>“I’m glad I had qui­etly in­vested in some jew­ellery years ago. Now we have some cash to run the house till my hus­band gets a new job,” Mrs Ra­jen­dran said.</p>
    <p>Many In­di­ans are us­ing their gold or­na­ments at home as col­lat­eral to cope with the eco­nomic re­ces­sion, job losses and tight­ened lend­ing poli­cies by banks.</p>
    <p>Since May, gold loan providers, most of them head­quar­tered in Ker­ala, have en­joyed brisk busi­ness from across the coun­try, with loans grow­ing by 18 per cent.</p>
    <p>As at Septem­ber, as­sets man­aged by In­dia’s lead­ing gold loan in­sti­tu­tions – Muthoot Fi­nance and Manap­pu­ram Fi­nance – had ex­panded by 33.4 per cent com­pared with the same pe­riod last year, a World Gold Coun­cil re­port this month showed.</p>
    <p>The re­port pro­jected that the or­gan­ised gold loan mar­ket in In­dia would grow at an an­nual rate of 15.7 per cent by 2022, from 3.44 tril­lion ru­pees this year to 4.61 tril­lion ru­pees in 2022.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter the lock­down was lifted, peo­ple started run­ning shops and fac­to­ries, but there were no se­cure jobs and banks were not ready to give new loans eas­ily. So fam­i­lies took gold loans for run­ning the house­hold, and small traders (did so) to buy new stock,” said Mr Geo Ge­orge, deputy gen­eral man­ager of KLM Ax­iva Fin­vest, a 14-yearold gold loan provider op­er­at­ing in South In­dia.</p>
    <p>Muthoot Fi­nance, the na­tion’s largest non-bank­ing fi­nancier, of­fer­ing gold loans in more than 4,000 branches, saw a 32 per cent in­crease in gold pledged against loans from June to Septem­ber – its high­est quar­terly growth rate in a decade.</p>
    <p>“We fo­cused on dig­i­tal op­er­a­tions, the mo­bile app and loan-ath­ome fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“From only 5 per cent of cus­tomers us­ing on­line ser­vices, since the pan­demic, about 20 per cent have been us­ing it,” said Mr K.R. Bi­ji­mon, chief gen­eral man­ager of the Muthoot Group.</p>
    <p>Lenders can of­fer up to 75 per cent of the value of the gold de­posited as col­lat­eral, at 12 per cent to 22 per cent in­ter­est a year.</p>
    <p>The up­per limit is reg­u­lated.</p>
    <p>If the loan is not re­paid within a year, the lender auc­tions the gold, closes the loan ac­count and re­turns any ex­cess amount to the cus­tomer.</p>
    <p>Muthoot’s av­er­age re­pay­ment pe­riod is four months and this has re­mained dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Gold is a col­lat­eral that can be quickly liq­ui­dated. Also, since or­na­ments are sen­ti­men­tal as­sets, a gold loan is of­ten the first loan peo­ple re­pay so that they won’t lose it,” added Mr Bi­ji­mon.</p>
    <p>With gold prices ris­ing by 28 per cent this year, banks have also started of­fer­ing gold loans with road­side kiosks and sim­pli­fied pro­ce­dures to at­tract cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>But non-bank lenders still have an edge, said Mr Ge­orge.</p>
    <p>“Our pro­cess­ing time is five to 15 min­utes, un­like banks that take a long time for pa­per­work,” he noted.</p>
    <p>Tra­di­tional gold loan providers also tout less pa­per­work, easy ac­ces­si­bil­ity and flex­i­ble re­pay­ment sched­ules.</p>
    <p>“Gold loans have helped mid­dle­class fam­i­lies to tide over the Covid-19 pe­riod fi­nan­cially and helped to restart the In­dian econ­omy, es­pe­cially by aid­ing mil­lions of small traders,” said Mr Bi­ji­mon.</p>
