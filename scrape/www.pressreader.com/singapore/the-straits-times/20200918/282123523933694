    <p>In its first in­vest­ment in a lo­cal en­tity since set­ting up shop in Sin­ga­pore ear­lier this year, the Asian Devel­op­ment Bank (ADB) will in­ject US$95 mil­lion (S$129 mil­lion) into Clif­ford Cap­i­tal Hold­ings (CCH), spurring growth in the Te­masek-backed com­pany – es­pe­cially in the area of sus­tain­able in­fra­struc­ture fi­nanc­ing in Asia.</p>
    <p>ABD will have a pro forma share­hold­ing of 10.8 per cent once all eq­uity cap­i­tal com­mit­ted has been fully de­ployed by 2024. It will also earn a board seat on CCH, the par­ties told The Busi­ness Times prior to their an­nounce­ment yes­ter­day, but de­clined to re­veal the rep­re­sen­ta­tive ap­pointed to the post.</p>
    <p>While the par­ties did not dis­close spe­cific projects in their pipe­line, CCH’s group chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fice Clive Kerner said the part­ner­ship will spur its ef­forts in un­lock­ing re­new­able en­ergy sources such as so­lar and wind.</p>
    <p>The in­vest­ments com­prise US$50 mil­lion from ADB and US$45 mil­lion from the Lead­ing Asia’s Pri­vate In­fra­struc­ture Fund ad­min­is­tered by ADB.</p>
    <p>The fund, which pro­vides co-fi­nanc­ing to non-sov­er­eign in­fra­struc­ture projects at dif­fer­ent stages of devel­op­ment, was es­tab­lished in 2016 with a US$1.5 bil­lion cap­i­tal com­mit­ment from the Ja­pan In­ter­na­tional Co­op­er­a­tion Agency.</p>
    <p>Describing the “strong align­ment” be­tween CCH and ADB’s ef­forts to ad­dress the in­fra­struc­ture fi­nanc­ing gap in Asia, Mr Kerner said: “Given the crit­i­cal in­sti­tu­tional role of ADB in the re­gion and its ex­pe­ri­ence in sup­port­ing ten­able in­fra­struc­ture devel­op­ment across Asia, we are con­fi­dent that we have es­tab­lished the right part­ner­ship to com­ple­ment our ex­ist­ing share­hold­ers to cap­ture new growth op­por­tu­ni­ties and gen­er­ate sus­tain­able value and long-term re­turns.”</p>
    <p>Mr Mike Bar­row, direc­tor-gen­eral of ADB’s pri­vate sec­tor op­er­a­tions depart­ment, said the en­tity was at­tracted to in­vest in CCH not only be­cause of its track record, but also the “qual­ity of the in­vestors al­ready in Clif­ford Cap­i­tal”.</p>
    <p>“We know them very well, but be­ing able to work even more closely through Clif­ford Cap­i­tal with the likes of Te­masek, Pru­den­tial and DBS is ex­tremely at­trac­tive and very valu­able be­cause these are key play­ers in the space in Asia,” he said.</p>
    <p>Set up in 1966, the ADB is an al­liance of 68 coun­tries – 49 of which are in the Asia-Pa­cific – which pro­motes so­cial and eco­nomic devel­op­ment in the re­gion. Its Sin­ga­pore of­fice opened in March this year and looks at tack­ling cli­mate change, fi­nanc­ing and build­ing qual­ity in­fra­struc­ture, and man­ag­ing ur­ban­i­sa­tion in the re­gion, among other pri­or­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to ADB’s es­ti­mates, de­vel­op­ing Asia will need to in­vest US$1.7 tril­lion per year in in­fra­struc­ture un­til 2030 to main­tain its growth mo­men­tum, as well as to tackle poverty and cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has ac­cel­er­ated the tran­si­tion to­wards sus­tain­abil­ity, said Mr Kerner. He added that with more coun­tries on­shoring their sup­ply chains and against the back­drop of low in­ter­est rates, in­fra­struc­ture as an as­set class may be­come in­creas­ingly at­trac­tive for in­vestors.</p>
    <p>Of­fer­ing a more nu­anced per­spec­tive, Mr Bar­row noted that gov­ern­ments have had to di­vert some fund­ing pre­vi­ously al­lo­cated to in­fra­struc­ture for other uses in re­sponse to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“In some sec­tors, there will also be short-term changes in the over­all de­mand and sup­ply for in­fra­struc­ture... For in­stance, the de­mand for in­fra­struc­ture like toll roads or even elec­tric­ity has been re­duced. So I think there is a lit­tle bit of a blip,” he said.</p>
    <p>But these mar­kets will come back strongly, he main­tained. “In fact, they will come back even more ro­bustly be­cause of the lag that there could be in spend­ing on in­fra­struc­ture dur­ing the pan­demic, and maybe there­after. And the gaps in fi­nanc­ing will only in­crease,” he said.</p>
    <p>“And that’s why the likes of ADB, Clif­ford Cap­i­tal and other devel­op­ment in­sti­tu­tions need to step up even more strongly as that re­bound hap­pens.”</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has ac­cel­er­ated the tran­si­tion to­wards sus­tain­abil­ity, said Clif­ford Cap­i­tal Hold­ings’ group chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fice Clive Kerner. He added that with more coun­tries on­shoring their sup­ply chains and against the back­drop of low in­ter­est rates, in­fra­struc­ture as an as­set class may be­come in­creas­ingly at­trac­tive for in­vestors.</p>
