    <p>A text-based ser­vice for peo­ple in dis­tress or con­tem­plat­ing sui­cide was launched last month un­der a pi­lot pro­gramme be­ing run by the Sa­mar­i­tans of Sin­ga­pore, which noted that sui­cide re­mains the lead­ing cause of death among peo­ple aged 10 to 29.</p>
    <p>A text-based ser­vice for peo­ple in dis­tress or con­tem­plat­ing sui­cide was launched last month un­der a pi­lot pro­gramme be­ing run by the Sa­mar­i­tans of Sin­ga­pore (SOS).</p>
    <p>The or­gan­i­sa­tion said yes­ter­day that the text mes­sag­ing op­tion is an al­ter­na­tive form of emo­tional sup­port to its phone hot­line and one that peo­ple have been call­ing for.</p>
    <p>SOS Care Text, as it is called, is also a re­sponse to the in­creased num­ber of calls and e-mails the or­gan­i­sa­tion fielded dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>This ser­vice comes as sui­cide num­bers among those aged 10 to 29 re­main a con­cern, with 94 cases last year – the same as in 2018 – ac­cord­ing to Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points</p>
    <p>Author­ity data re­leased last week.</p>
    <p>There were 400 sui­cides re­ported last year, con­tin­u­ing an up­ward trend af­ter 397 cases in 2018 and 361 in 2017, but still fewer than the 429 in 2016.</p>
    <p>SOS noted that sui­cide re­mains the lead­ing cause of death among peo­ple aged 10 to 29, adding that the num­ber of sui­cides among the 20 to 29 age co­hort re­mains the high­est com­pared with other age groups.</p>
    <p>Sui­cide ac­counted for one-third of all re­ported deaths in the 20 to 29 age group, with 71 young peo­ple tak­ing their lives last year. There were 4,124 calls to SOS from this group be­tween April 2019 and March 2020 com­pared with 3,396 in the same pe­riod a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>SOS said that of peo­ple who re­vealed their age, those be­tween 20 and 29 ac­counted for about 17 per cent of to­tal calls to the 24-hour hot­line and 37 per cent of its e-mail be­friend­ing clients.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­di­vid­u­als of­ten cited is­sues with ro­man­tic re­la­tion­ships and dif­fi­cul­ties cop­ing with their men­tal health, as well as strug­gles man­ag­ing chal­leng­ing sit­u­a­tions, as fac­tors con­tribut­ing to their acute dis­tress, said SOS.</p>
    <p>SOS chief ex­ec­u­tive Gasper Tan said that while the in­crease in calls is an en­cour­ag­ing sign that young peo­ple are recog­nis­ing the im­por­tance of their men­tal health and the need for early in­ter­ven­tion, the high num­ber of sui­cides in the age group is con­cern­ing. He said: “Much more re­mains to be done as a com­mu­nity to fur­ther un­der­stand and ad­dress the is­sues that may pre­vent our youth from seek­ing help.”</p>
    <p>So­cial worker Asher Low, who runs Lim­it­less, a char­ity for young peo­ple with men­tal health is­sues, agreed that the num­ber of youth sui­cides last year is sig­nif­i­cant.</p>
    <p>He added that the num­ber of teen fe­male sui­cides is “alarm­ing, as girls in gen­eral have al­ways had a lower sui­cide rate than boys, and to have the num­bers al­most ‘equal’ is out of the norm”.</p>
    <p>Ten fe­males aged 10 to 19 took their own lives last year com­pared with three in 2018, while 13 boys in the same age group com­mit­ted sui­cide last year com­pared with 19 the year be­fore.</p>
    <p>Mr Low said the num­bers could pro­vide a pic­ture of the sup­port – or lack of – that young peo­ple may be get­ting from fam­ily, peers and other sys­tems such as schools and churches, and the amount of pres­sure and stress they could be fac­ing.</p>
    <p>He added that a com­mon fac­tor in youth sui­ci­dal­ity that Lim­it­less has seen a lot re­cently is emo­tional and psy­cho­log­i­cal pain.</p>
    <p>This pain can be caused by abu­sive par­ents, or par­ents who do not know bet­ter and think they are be­ing hard on their chil­dren for their own good, not know­ing that their chil­dren have men­tal health strug­gles, said Mr Low.</p>
    <p>He also said many young peo­ple may still be un­will­ing to seek help when strug­gling with a men­tal health is­sue, not­ing that this is not the fault of the per­son but, rather, a struc­tural is­sue that needs to be re­solved through pol­icy changes mak­ing it eas­ier to do so.</p>
    <p>He sug­gested low­er­ing bar­ri­ers such as cost, em­pha­sis­ing con­fi­den­tial­ity, tai­lor­ing more ser­vices to­wards sup­port­ing young­sters’ men­tal health and pro­vid­ing more peo­ple with the skill sets to sup­port friends and fam­ily mem­bers.</p>
    <p>“While we can’t change things such as evolv­ing fam­ily struc­tures, lower neigh­bourly sup­port or ‘kam­pung spirit’, which all con­trib­ute to­wards low­ered so­cial sup­port in gen­eral for youth, we can change the safety net that we pro­vide such youth who may be strug­gling with dif­fi­cult cir­cum­stances and men­tal health is­sues,” said Mr Low.</p>
