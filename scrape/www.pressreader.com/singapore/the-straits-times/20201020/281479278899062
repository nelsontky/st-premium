    <p>A Malaysian Fire and Res­cue Depart­ment of­fi­cer sani­tis­ing an area out­side a block of apart­ments in Shah Alam, Se­lan­gor, yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The coun­try recorded 865 cases yes­ter­day, the third con­sec­u­tive day when daily in­fec­tions were above 800.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment is now de­bat­ing whether it should im­pose a stricter lock­down in Se­lan­gor, Malaysia’s most in­dus­tri­alised state.</p>
    <p>PETALING JAYA • Malaysia yes­ter­day re­ported 865 new Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours, slightly lower than the record-high 871 logged on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>It was the third con­sec­u­tive day of above-800 in­fec­tions recorded in a sin­gle day, with the gov­ern­ment mulling over whether to im­pose a stricter lock­down for Se­lan­gor. The state, with Kuala Lumpur and Pu­tra­jaya, were placed un­der the con­di­tional move­ment con­trol or­der (CMCO) for 14 days from last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s cu­mu­la­tive to­tal of cases yes­ter­day stood at 21,363, since the coun­try re­ported its first Covid-19 cases in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry’s di­rec­tor­gen­eral, Dr Noor Hisham Ab­dul­lah, said there were three new deaths yes­ter­day, tak­ing the to­tal num­ber of fa­tal­i­ties to 190. The three deaths were all in Sabah.</p>
    <p>The bulk of the new cases con­tin­ued to come from Sabah, with 643 new in­fec­tions out of 865, or 74.3 per cent of the to­tal.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent spike in Malaysia has been blamed on the two weeks of cam­paign­ing ahead of the Sept 26 Sabah state elec­tions, as politi­cians and cam­paign­ers from all over the coun­try min­gled freely with Saba­hans at po­lit­i­cal ral­lies. Some of these vis­i­tors later brought Covid-19 to their home states.</p>
    <p>Se­lan­gor yes­ter­day logged 107 cases, or 12.4 per cent of new cases. This was fol­lowed by the fed­eral ter­ri­tory of Labuan, with 34 cases, and Pe­nang’s 26 new cases.</p>
    <p>In Shah Alam, Se­lan­gor, Malaysian car­maker Pro­ton con­firmed yes­ter­day that 49 of its em­ploy­ees have tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, after one of its staff testing pos­i­tive ear­lier on Oct 14.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, some schools in Perak, Me­laka and sev­eral other states have been or­dered to close after stu­dents were found to be in­fected.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate news brief­ing, Se­nior Min­is­ter for Se­cu­rity Is­mail Sabri Yaakob said that the Health Min­istry has been asked whether there is a need to place the whole state of Se­lan­gor un­der an en­hanced MCO (EMCO).</p>
    <p>The on­go­ing CMCO has meant the shut­down of most so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties such as mass wor­ship, but the gov­ern­ment has al­lowed gyms and pub­lic parks to re­main open.</p>
    <p>Malls, of­fices and mar­kets have re­mained open, too, while im­pos­ing what the gov­ern­ment calls stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures (SOPs) such as the check­ing of tem­per­a­tures and pro­vid­ing hand sani­tis­ers.</p>
    <p>But un­der the EMCO, an area would be gen­er­ally cor­doned off, with the shut­down of most eco­nomic and so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Pack­ets of food would need to be sent into homes in these ar­eas, as res­i­dents would be banned from leav­ing their homes even to buy food.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Is­mail raised the is­sue as cases in Se­lan­gor con­tin­ued to climb. He said: “We have asked the min­istry to look into this, to re­view the SOPs and give the Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil its as­sess­ment on the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“While there are those who feel that plac­ing these ar­eas un­der en­hanced MCO will do the trick to bring down the cases, bear in mind that this means the econ­omy will have to be shut down and food will be sent over to the houses.”</p>
