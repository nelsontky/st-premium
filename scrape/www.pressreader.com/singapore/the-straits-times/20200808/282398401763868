    <p>When the hand­i­caps for to­day’s meet­ing were re­leased on Mon­day evening, cham­pion jockey Vlad Duric must have smiled with glee.</p>
    <p>Not only has he a book of good rides, but also what was most im­por­tant was the two top horses of­fered to him did not clash in the same race. They are placed in the two dif­fer­ent divi­sions of the $70,000 Class 3 events over 1,200m on turf.</p>
    <p>His last-start win­ner Rocket Star is en­gaged in the Divi­sion 1 af­fair in Race 10 and his new equine as­so­ciate, Cham­pion Ju­ve­nile In­ferno, is in the Divi­sion 2 sec­tion in Race 7.</p>
    <p>In­ferno, tipped as the best bet by many rac­ing pun­dits, was rid­den by jockey Michael Rodd in his four con­sec­u­tive wins and a sec­ond from as many starts.</p>
    <p>But Rodd has since re­lin­quished his Kranji li­cence to re­turn to Aus­tralia be­cause of the long rac­ing lock­down in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Duric has now tied up with the Cliff Brown-trained pro­lific sprinter. He must have heaved a big sigh of re­lief that the horse is not com­pet­ing in the same race as the Ri­cardo Le Grange-trained Rocket Star, an­other po­ten­tial cham­pion in the mak­ing.</p>
    <p>“I’m re­ally look­ing for­ward to rid­ing In­ferno in a race. I’m also very for­tu­nate he’s not in the same race as Rocket Star and Mr Malek,” said the Aus­tralian.</p>
    <p>“I feel In­ferno is in the slightly weaker race, but he’s first-up, and we still have to see how he pro­gresses.”</p>
    <p>The Bar­ree-Sta­ble-owned In­ferno was un­de­feated in his first four starts, in­clud­ing the Group 2 Aushorse Golden Horse­shoe and the Group 3 Saas Fee Stakes, both over 1,200m on turf.</p>
    <p>At his last start on Feb 29, the four-year-old, who is seen as the po­ten­tial suc­ces­sor to the sta­ble’s Horse of the Year Debt Col­lec­tor, beat all but Siam War­rior in a Class 3 race over 1,200m.</p>
    <p>He had good rea­sons for his de­feat. He had to cover ex­tra ground af­ter jump­ing from a wide bar­rier and was car­ried wider by horses on his inside dur­ing the run­ning.</p>
    <p>But he fin­ished with the sim­i­lar turbo-charged fin­ish of Debt Col­lec­tor to be 13/ lengths be­hind the win</p>
    <p>4 ner. Debt Col­lec­tor is now rac­ing in Aus­tralia as Debt Agent.</p>
    <p>Duric has been work­ing reg­u­larly on In­ferno. He is pleased with the good prepa­ra­tion, in­clud­ing a fan­tas­tic win in the sec­ond of his two tri­als, for to­day’s as­sign­ment.</p>
    <p>“He’s had a re­ally good prep. I rode him in a quiet trial and, in the sec­ond one, I gave him a squeeze up the straight in the last 200m and he gave me a fan­tas­tic feeling,” he said.</p>
    <p>“He’s fur­nished and ma­tured, and I’m re­ally ex­cited to ride him.”</p>
    <p>Duric, who has 12 rides in to­day’s 14-race pro­gramme and will miss tomorrow week’s Kranji Mile meet­ing be­cause of a one-day care­less rid­ing sus­pen­sion, reck­oned Rocket Star’s big­gest threat is the Lee Freedman-trained Mr Malek. His chal­lenger is un­beaten in four starts af­ter his de­but third.</p>
    <p>“The other Class 3 race is a great race, Mr Malek is a classy four-yearold, and there isn’t much be­tween him and Rocket Star,” said Duric, who was aboard Mr Malek in one of the vic­to­ries.</p>
    <p>“Rocket Star, how­ever, has the fit­ness edge over Mr Malek as he’s al­ready won first-up. That could be the telling fac­tor.”</p>
    <p>Mr Malek has not raced since scor­ing on March 20 with Pa­trick Moloney astride. The Os­car Rac­ing Sta­ble-owned geld­ing will have A’Isisuhairi Kasim aboard for the first time.</p>
    <p>Although Mr Malek has not raced for 41/ months, Freedman reck</p>
    <p>2 oned the ris­ing star is among his horses who have thrived dur­ing the Covid-19 lock­down.</p>
    <p>“This break has not had many pos­i­tives in gen­eral, but it did have some pos­i­tive ef­fect on some horses, and Mr Malek is one of them,” said the 2018 Sin­ga­pore cham­pion trainer.</p>
    <p>“He has ad­justed very well to the break and seems to have come out in even bet­ter shape. He’s drawn in six, which is not a bad draw. He’s a horse who gets onto the speed.”</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian Hall of Fame trainer added that he was very happy with Mr Malek’s fi­nal gal­lop on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>So, Mr Malek or Rocket Star? Or will there be an upset?</p>
    <p>We’ll know af­ter 4.30pm to­day.</p>
