    <p>Tom Kel­ley is a sen­si­tive soul. Shortly af­ter send­ing the man­u­script of his first book, The Art Of In­no­va­tion, to his pub­lisher, he vis­ited Ke­pler’s, a book­shop in Menlo Park in Sil­i­con Val­ley.</p>
    <p>“I lit­er­ally started to cry”, he con­fessed to a group of au­thors to which I be­long, “think­ing about all the ef­fort and all the sac­ri­fices au­thors had made to get those thou­sands of books on to the stage.”</p>
    <p>I see you, Tom. I vividly re­mem­ber my ex­cite­ment the first time I saw one of my books in the wild, in Kramer­books in Wash­ing­ton DC. Eight books later, I can at­test that writ­ing and pub­lish­ing one is still as ex­cit­ing – and still as ex­haust­ing. Think­ing of my fel­low au­thors go­ing through the same thing is rather mov­ing; that book­shops keep be­ing shut down by the pan­demic sim­ply adds to the pathos.</p>
    <p>But books are not the only prod­ucts that should make us pause in awe and grat­i­tude. What about the hum­ble pen­cil?</p>
    <p>In a fa­mous 1958 es­say, I, Pen­cil:</p>
    <p>My Fam­ily Tree As Told To Leonard E. Read, the pen­cil-nar­ra­tor ac­knowl­edges that it is eas­ily over­looked. “Pick me up and look me over. What do you see? Not much meets the eye – there’s some wood, lac­quer, the printed la­belling, graphite lead, a bit of metal and an eraser.”</p>
    <p>Read’s pen­cil is a pros­e­lytis­ing free-mar­ket fan and ex­plains that it has an im­pres­sive pedi­gree: Its graphite is from Cey­lon, mixed with Mis­sis­sippi clay, sul­phuric acid and an­i­mal fats. Its cedar wood grew nat­u­rally but har­vest­ing the tim­ber re­quired saws, axes, mo­tors, rope and a rail­way car.</p>
    <p>The pen­cil – if you let it – will talk your ears off on the sub­ject of its six coats of lac­quer, or the ori­gin of the brass in its fer­rule, or the eraser on its tip. (Shock­ingly, the pen­cil even re­veals how the graphite gets into the mid­dle of the wood. I will not spoil that for you; econo-ma­gi­cians must keep their se­crets.)</p>
    <p>THE TOASTER PROJECT</p>
    <p>A mod­ern vari­a­tion on the pen­cil’s fam­ily tree comes cour­tesy of Thomas Thwaites, an artist and de­signer whose “Toaster Project” was an at­tempt to de­sign and build an or­di­nary toaster, be­gin­ning with as­sem­bling his own raw ma­te­ri­als – quar­ry­ing mica, re­fin­ing plas­tic, smelt­ing steel.</p>
    <p>“You could eas­ily spend your life mak­ing a toaster,” he said when I in­ter­viewed him about the project more than a decade ago. And in­deed he took var­i­ous short­cuts. Nev­er­the­less, his fin­ished toaster cost about £1,000 (S$1,760) and re­quired sev­eral months of work. It looked like a cake iced by a three-year-old, and when plugged into the mains, it im­me­di­ately caught fire.</p>
    <p>A bud­get shop-bought toaster does not catch fire and costs less than a hard­back book. It is un­likely to move any­one to tears, yet the peo­ple who mine me­tals, re­fine plas­tics, gen­er­ate our elec­tric­ity and de­sign safe elec­tri­cal ap­pli­ances no doubt work at least as hard as any au­thor. The re­sults are so cheap and re­li­able we over­look them.</p>
    <p>In­deed, we are sur­rounded by prod­ucts we barely un­der­stand, pro­duced by peo­ple we never meet, of­ten at a qual­ity so high and a price so low – rel­a­tive to our wages – that our an­ces­tors would be stag­gered.</p>
    <p>No one per­son has a com­plete view of the pro­duc­tion process or co­or­di­nates it from the mo­ment the cedar tree sprouts to the mo­ment the bar­code on the box of pen­cils is scanned at the check­out.</p>
    <p>“No one sit­ting in a cen­tral of­fice gave or­ders,” ex­plained free-mar­ket evan­ge­list and No­bel Memo­rial Prize-win­ning econ­o­mist Mil­ton Fried­man, who helped make Read’s pen­cil es­say fa­mous.</p>
    <p>The lais­sez-faire im­pli­ca­tions of all this de­cen­tralised com­plex­ity were ob­vi­ous to Dr Fried­man, and the pen­cil it­self put it best: “Leave all cre­ative en­er­gies un­in­hib­ited... Have faith that free men and women will re­spond to the In­vis­i­ble Hand.”</p>
    <p>I have sym­pa­thy with that con­clu­sion but it does not fol­low as a mat­ter of logic. The pen­cil’s fam­ily tree in­cludes gov­ern­ment-granted patents, gov­ern­ment-owned rail­ways and a large in­dus­trial con­glom­er­ate. Or­ders from cen­tral of­fices are def­i­nitely given.</p>
    <p>And a left-winger might in­stead be prompted by the pen­cil’s story to lament our alien­ation from the ob­jects that sur­round us. We read books, make toast, sketch with pen­cils and yet we have no real idea how, where or by whom even these sim­ple ob­jects were made – let alone about ev­ery stage of some­thing more com­plex such as a car, a com­puter or a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>A THOU­SAND THANKS</p>
    <p>Sim­ple, lo­cal, hand­crafted prod­ucts have an un­de­ni­able emo­tional ap­peal, though life would not nec­es­sar­ily be bet­ter if we all had to whit­tle our own pen­cils.</p>
    <p>Leav­ing to one side the de­bate over eco­nomic ide­ol­ogy, I ap­plaud Mr Kel­ley’s ap­pre­ci­a­tion of the ef­fort and cre­ativ­ity, of­ten from peo­ple un­known, that went into the prod­ucts that sur­rounded him.</p>
    <p>A.J. Ja­cobs, in his book Thanks A Thou­sand, grace­fully un­der­scored this point. He de­cided to thank, in per­son or on the phone, ev­ery­one in­volved in mak­ing his morn­ing cof­fee, from the barista to the pest-con­trol ex­pert at the ware­house, the lid de­signer to the work­ers at the reser­voir that sup­plied the wa­ter – about a thou­sand peo­ple in all.</p>
    <p>At a time when the pan­demic has caused some very vis­i­ble wounds to work­ers we see ev­ery day, it has been as­ton­ish­ing how many peo­ple have been able to keep work­ing pro­duc­tively.</p>
    <p>Books are still be­ing pub­lished; pen­cils are still be­ing made; I bought a new toaster just a few weeks ago.</p>
    <p>Tears or no tears, I am try­ing to no­tice the con­tri­bu­tion both of those who are no longer able to work and of those who are.</p>
