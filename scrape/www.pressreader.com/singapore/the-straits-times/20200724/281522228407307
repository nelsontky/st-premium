    <p>Mrs Toh Siew Choo had planned to re­turn to her home in Jo­hor Baru on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The 53-year-old, who was work­ing as a nanny in Sin­ga­pore, has not seen her fam­ily for more than six months.</p>
    <p>But like many other Malaysians in Sin­ga­pore, Mrs Toh quickly changed her plans af­ter the Malaysian gov­ern­ment an­nounced this week that Malaysians re­turn­ing from to­day will have to serve a 14-day quar­an­tine at ho­tels or quar­an­tine cen­tres.</p>
    <p>They will also have to bear the full cost of the stay.</p>
    <p>Mrs Toh said: “I have been want­ing to go back as I miss my fam­ily. I would usu­ally have vis­ited them every one or two months.</p>
    <p>“I de­cided to go back ear­lier so that I can spend more time with them in­stead of stay­ing at a fa­cil­ity out­side.”</p>
    <p>Malaysians who re­turned by yes­ter­day will still have to serve a quar­an­tine, but they can do so at home, pro­vided they test neg­a­tive for Covid-19 upon ar­rival.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral other Malaysians who spoke to The Straits Times out­side the Wood­lands Check­point yes­ter­day af­ter­noon said they wanted to avoid be­ing quar­an­tined at an ex­ter­nal fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>They had heard that the 14-day stay would cost them about RM150 (S$49) daily.</p>
    <p>Pic­tures of long queues on the Cause­way out­side the Jo­hor Baru check­point were up­loaded on so­cial me­dia yes­ter­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>One set of pic­tures shows the queue snaking out onto the road in front of the check­point build­ing.</p>
    <p>An­other photo taken at about 9.40am from a traf­fic cam­era in front of the build­ing sim­i­larly shows a queue spilling onto the road.</p>
    <p>When ST vis­ited the Wood­lands Check­point build­ing at about 11.30am, a trickle of peo­ple en­tered the im­mi­gra­tion area, but no queue was spot­ted in­side.</p>
    <p>Over a pe­riod of about three hours, about 30 peo­ple were seen drag­ging their lug­gage into the build­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Krishna Murthy, 32, who works in the oil and gas in­dus­try, said he was glad he could make it back to Malaysia yes­ter­day be­fore the re­vised quar­an­tine rules kicked in.</p>
    <p>He had not seen his wife since he re­turned to Sin­ga­pore for work fol­low­ing their wed­ding in Fe­bru­ary, but is now look­ing for­ward to spend­ing some time with her.</p>
    <p>“I ap­plied for home leave to go back to see my fam­ily. I am still work­ing in Sin­ga­pore, and I will ap­ply to come back when the Sin­ga­pore-Malaysia green lane opens,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, two Malaysians who lost their jobs in Sin­ga­pore and had trou­ble find­ing new ones said they de­cided to re­turn ear­lier to avoid bear­ing the cost of stay­ing at a des­ig­nated quar­an­tine fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>For­mer fork­lift driver Bala Dinesh, 46, who worked in Sin­ga­pore for 14 years, said: “I have no money and no place to stay in Sin­ga­pore. How am I go­ing to pay the RM2,000 needed to stay in a quar­an­tine cen­tre with no work?</p>
    <p>“But even af­ter I go home, pay­ing the bills and find­ing work is still go­ing to be a prob­lem.”</p>

    <p>NO MONEY, NO JOB</p>
    <p>I miss my fam­ily. I would usu­ally have vis­ited them every one or two months. I de­cided to go back ear­lier so that I can spend more time with them in­stead of stay­ing at a fa­cil­ity out­side.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Malaysian work&#xAD;ers in Sin&#xAD;ga&#xAD;pore re&#xAD;turned to Jo&#xAD;hor Baru in droves yes&#xAD;ter&#xAD;day, ahead of a new rule that will see those re&#xAD;turn&#xAD;ing to Malaysia serve 14 days in quar&#xAD;an&#xAD;tine at des&#xAD;ig&#xAD;nated fa&#xAD;cil&#xAD;i&#xAD;ties and pay for it. As a re&#xAD;sult, snaking queues (left and above) were seen yes&#xAD;ter&#xAD;day morn&#xAD;ing out&#xAD;side the Jo&#xAD;hor Baru Cus&#xAD;toms, Im&#xAD;mi&#xAD;gra&#xAD;tion and Quar&#xAD;an&#xAD;tine Com&#xAD;plex.</p>
