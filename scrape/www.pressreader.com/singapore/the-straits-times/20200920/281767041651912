    <p>The New Naratif web­site has re­sponded to a re­cent po­lice re­port filed against it by the as­sis­tant re­turn­ing of­fi­cer of the Elec­tions De­part­ment (ELD), call­ing it an in­stance of ha­rass­ment against the Gov­ern­ment’s crit­ics and an abuse of the law.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, New Naratif said the po­lice re­port is “a con­tin­u­a­tion of the PAP gov­ern­ment’s at­tempts to in­tim­i­date in­de­pen­dent me­dia, and is an abuse of the Par­lia­men­tary Elec­tions Act de­signed to strike fear into the hearts of the gov­ern­ment’s crit­ics and cit­i­zenry”.</p>
    <p>The ELD had said on Fri­day that it filed the po­lice re­port af­ter New Naratif pub­lished five ad­ver­tise­ments dur­ing the cam­paign pe­riod of the gen­eral elec­tion in July, which the ELD said vi­o­lated the Act.</p>
    <p>One of the al­legedly il­le­gal ad­ver­tise­ments fea­tured a satir­i­cal video in the style of a per­fume ad that ac­cused Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong of tar­get­ing his crit­ics un­der the guise of the rule of law, among other things.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Act, only elec­tion ad­ver­tis­ing that is done by or on be­half of a can­di­date is al­lowed.</p>
    <p>The ELD said New Naratif was not act­ing on be­half of any can­di­date when it pub­lished the ads on Face­book.</p>
    <p>In its re­sponse, New Naratif re­peated its po­si­tion that Sin­ga­pore’s laws are writ­ten too broadly and there­fore make le­git­i­mate po­lit­i­cal ac­tiv­ity il­le­gal with­out a per­mit. It added that the ELD’s use of the Act against it demon­strates this.</p>
    <p>The web­site also ac­cused the Gov­ern­ment of mount­ing an on­go­ing ha­rass­ment cam­paign against it, de­scrib­ing it­self as an in­de­pen­dent me­dia or­gan­i­sa­tion that has been crit­i­cal of the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>New Naratif added that there were also “nu­mer­ous at­tacks” on its man­ag­ing di­rec­tor, his­to­rian Thum Ping Tjin, and its other founders and staff.</p>
    <p>The web­site was founded in 2017 by three Sin­ga­pore­ans – Dr Thum, free­lance jour­nal­ist Kirsten Han and comic artist Sonny Liew.</p>
    <p>Ms Han stepped down as the web­site’s ed­i­tor-inchief in April this year.</p>
