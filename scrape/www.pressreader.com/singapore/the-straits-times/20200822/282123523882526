    <p>A for­mer lec­turer of a post-se­condary in­sti­tu­tion who shot up­skirt videos of a fe­male stu­dent was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to eight weeks’ jail.</p>
    <p>The man, his vic­tim and their school can­not be named due to a gag or­der to pro­tect her iden­tity.</p>
    <p>The 39-year-old Sin­ga­porean pleaded guilty on June 15 to in­sult­ing the woman’s mod­esty.</p>
    <p>At his re­quest, the pair had met in a va­cant class­room on March 6 last year.</p>
    <p>Af­ter chat­ting for a while, he asked her to help him pre­pare for a class ac­tiv­ity by pos­ing as a model. He said he would be us­ing his mo­bile phone to take the pho­tos, which would be used in the in­struc­tions for the class ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>When she agreed, he in­structed her to pose blind­folded with a hand­ker­chief and with her feet apart. Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tor Derek Ee had ear­lier said the stu­dent felt un­com­fort­able but did not ques­tion her lec­turer.</p>
    <p>Af­ter she blind­folded her­self and posed, the man took a photo from be­hind her. He then ap­proached her, put his phone be­tween her legs and recorded a video. The stu­dent sub­se­quently felt un­com­fort­able, turned around and took off her blind­fold.</p>
    <p>The DPP added: “To her sur­prise, she saw the ac­cused squat­ting right be­hind her, hold­ing his mo­bile phone in be­tween her legs, with the screen fac­ing up­wards.”</p>
    <p>She closed her legs, re­turned the hand­ker­chief to him and left.</p>
    <p>Feel­ing un­com­fort­able about what her lec­turer had done, she re­turned shortly af­ter to con­front him and de­manded to see his phone. He agreed but walked over slowly while delet­ing the videos.</p>
    <p>He let her see a photo show­ing her from the back, which he claimed was the only one he took.</p>
    <p>Later that day, the stu­dent told her guardian about the in­ci­dent. Af­ter the lec­turer failed to pick up her guardian’s calls, she texted him say­ing that her guardian wished to speak with him.</p>
    <p>He texted back say­ing the in­ci­dent was a “mis­un­der­stand­ing” and that he had fum­bled with his phone while ad­just­ing it to take a photo. He added that he had ended up catch­ing it while it was fac­ing up and with the flash on.</p>
    <p>She lodged a po­lice re­port in the evening of the same day.</p>
    <p>The man even­tu­ally ad­mit­ted to the po­lice to tak­ing two up­skirt videos of the stu­dent and delet­ing them af­ter. He also ad­mit­ted he had taken other up­skirt videos of his stu­dents on sev­eral oc­ca­sions.</p>
