    <p>Ms Sher­maine Chan was torn be­tween stay­ing in Sin­ga­pore with her hus­band and re­turn­ing to Malaysia to see her one-year-old daugh­ter. Af­ter four months apart since Malaysia shut its bor­der on March 18, Ms Chan quit her re­tail job to re­turn to Jo­hor last Mon­day.</p>
    <p>This was a day be­fore Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia an­nounced the re­cip­ro­cal green lane and pe­ri­odic com­mut­ing ar­range­ment which will be­gin on Aug 10.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t know how long more I would have to wait to see Phoebe. I didn’t have a choice,” said Ms Chan, 28, a Malaysian who came to Sin­ga­pore to work nine years ago.</p>
    <p>Her par­ents help to take care of her daugh­ter back in Jo­hor.</p>
    <p>Both Ms Chan and her hus­band, Mr Yip Ching Hing, are now per­ma­nent res­i­dents here and rent a three-bed­room Hous­ing Board flat in Be­dok.</p>
    <p>Mr Yip, 30, who also works in the re­tail sec­tor, said: “We de­cided that our daugh­ter should not be with­out her par­ents for too long. We can’t go back to­gether. I need to stay here to work so I can buy milk pow­der for my daugh­ter.”</p>
    <p>He last saw his daugh­ter on the week­end of March 14 in Jo­hor. In pre-Covid-19 days, Ms Chan would travel to Jo­hor ev­ery week­end to see her daugh­ter. Mr Yip would join her if he had the week­end off.</p>
    <p>Last Mon­day, Ms Chan walked for an hour from Wood­lands Check­point to Jo­hor Bahru Check­point, with lug­gage in tow as there was lim­ited trans­porta­tion.</p>
    <p>At the Malaysian check­point, she had to take a swab test. “I took the test at 12pm and got the re­sult at about 4pm. I was neg­a­tive and was al­lowed to leave im­mi­gra­tion,” said Ms Chan, who paid RM60 (S$20) for the test. “Those who are pos­i­tive would be taken to a hos­pi­tal.”</p>
    <p>Ms Chan, who is cur­rently serv­ing a 14-day quar­an­tine at home, said: “I hope my hus­band can make it back in time to cel­e­brate our daugh­ter’s birth­day. She will be turn­ing two on Aug 14, four days af­ter the ‘green lane’ opens.”</p>
