    <p>DOHA • A bit­ter feud be­tween Qatar and a Saudi-led al­liance may fi­nally be near­ing its end, as Gulf Arab lead­ers meet. Here is a look at the dis­pute that has di­vided the re­gion.</p>
    <p>On May 24, 2017, a state­ment at­trib­uted to Qatar’s ruler ap­pears on the state news agency’s web­site, ap­par­ently en­dors­ing Is­lamist move­ments and crit­i­cis­ing United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump. Qatar says the site was hacked and the state­ment is fake.</p>
    <p>On June 5, Saudi Ara­bia and al­lies Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) abruptly cut off air, land and sea links, and diplo­matic ties with their neigh­bour.</p>
    <p>Later that month, the Saudiled coali­tion i ssues 13 de­mands in re­turn for lift­ing the boy­cott. It also de­mands that Doha curb its re­la­tions with Iran. Qatar re­jects them.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust 2017, satel­lite chan­nel be­outQ be­gins broad­cast­ing top-flight foot­ball to Saudi au­di­ences. Qatar-based broad­caster beIN ac­cuses it of pi­rat­ing its pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>Through­out 2018, Qatar and the UAE trade ac­cu­sa­tions over ac­cess to airspace.</p>
    <p>In De­cem­ber 2019, Qatar’s emir de­clines an in­vi­ta­tion by Saudi Ara­bia to at­tend a Gulf Co­op­er­a­tion Coun­cil (GCC) sum­mit in Riyadh.</p>
    <p>On June 16 last year, a World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion panel rules that Riyadh failed to pro­tect the in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty rights of Qatari broad­caster beIN by re­fus­ing to take ac­tion against pi­rate out­fit be­outQ.</p>
    <p>On July 14, the UN’s top court finds in favour of Qatar in its com­plaint against the air block­ade im­posed by Saudi Ara­bia and its al­lies.</p>
    <p>On Dec 4, Saudi For­eign Min­is­ter Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud says a “fi­nal agree­ment looks in reach”. Qatar’s For­eign Min­is­ter Sheikh Mo­hammed bin Ab­dul­rah­man Al-Thani says “there are some move­ments that we hope will put an end (to) this cri­sis”.</p>
    <p>On Dec 30, the GCC says King Sal­man bin Ab­du­laziz Al Saud in­vited the Qatari emir to its sum­mit i n Riyadh.</p>
