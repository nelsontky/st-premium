    <p>• Debu­tant Im Sung-jae knows ex­actly what he would serve at the Cham­pi­ons Din­ner should he, in the near fu­ture, pro­duce a Masters Tour­na­ment vic­tory.</p>
    <p>“Mar­i­nated ribs,” said the South Korean, a self-con­fessed foodie. “I feel like play­ers of all na­tion­al­ity would love that and I would of course cook them in the Korean style.”</p>
    <p>The 22-year-old wun­derkind makes his Masters de­but this week at Au­gusta Na­tional, qual­i­fy­ing for the sto­ried event by virtue of his win at The Honda Clas­sic in March.</p>
    <p>Since be­com­ing the Korn Ferry Tour Player of the Year in 2018, his ca­reer has blos­somed to the point that some sea­soned ob­servers be­lieve he is very much ca­pable of win­ning a Ma­jor.</p>
    <p>Justin Thomas, the 2017 FedExCup cham­pion, has played enough golf with Im to know the Korean ris­ing star is the real deal.</p>
    <p>“I think im­pres­sive is an un­der­state­ment. He’s way be­yond his years for how young he is and how well he’s han­dled his sit­u­a­tion,” the Amer­i­can said.</p>
    <p>“The shots that he hits, to have that much va­ri­ety in your game and be able to hit it high, re­ally high with spin and hit it low and flight it and hold it up against the winds, both left to right and right to left, is very im­pres­sive.”</p>
    <p>Im will need to once again master those shots if he is to have a chance this week. Au­gusta Na­tional has not seen a debu­tant don the Green Jacket since Fuzzy Zoeller won the Masters in his first visit in 1979, some 18 years be­fore Im was born.</p>
    <p>Still, he is look­ing for­ward to test­ing his cre­ativ­ity at Au­gusta Na­tional, and re­mem­bers well the fa­mous chip-in birdie by Tiger Woods on the 16th hole en route to win­ning the tour­na­ment in 2005.</p>
    <p>“That curv­ing chip shot from the back of the green re­ally stands out for me. I think I was about eight or nine years old when I saw that,” said Im.</p>
    <p>“I’m in­cred­i­bly proud to com­pete as a Korean player. Since this is my Masters de­but, I do feel the pres­sure of com­pet­ing in a Ma­jor, but I hope to over­come that and play my own game.”</p>
    <p>In Masters his­tory, Korea’s K.J. Choi has come clos­est to win­ning the tour­na­ment fol­low­ing his third-place fin­ish in 2004.</p>
    <p>With Asia seek­ing a l on­gawaited sec­ond Ma­jor winner fol­low­ing Y.E. Yang’s tri­umph at the 2009 PGA Cham­pi­onship and first at the Masters, Im is fully aware of the pres­sure to per­form con­sis­tently at the game’s high­est level.</p>
    <p>“Since this is a Ma­jor, I would like to first make the cut. Af­ter that, I would be happy with a top-15 or top-20 fin­ish,” said the world’s 25th-ranked player.</p>
    <p>“I hope to ad­just to the course quickly and per­form well. I’ve heard from other play­ers the winds tend to swirl, so I ex­pect it to change di­rec­tions con­stantly. I also know the un­du­la­tion on the greens will be se­vere and I’ll have to take all of those into con­sid­er­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>An­other Asian debu­tant in­spired by Woods’ per­for­mance in 2005 is C.T. Pan, the first golfer from Chi­nese Taipei since Lin Wen-tang in 2009 to qual­ify for the Masters.</p>
    <p>“I will al­ways re­mem­ber that scene,” said the 28-year-old, who makes his de­but thanks largely to his maiden vic­tory at the 2019 RBC Her­itage. “And now, through years of hard work, I can fi­nally stand on the tee of the first hole at the Masters.”</p>
    <p>To pre­pare, he played a prac­tice round at Au­gusta Na­tional with a club mem­ber two weeks ago. He ab­sorbed all that he could, scrib­bling notes on his yardage book, es­pe­cially per­tain­ing to the course’s famed light­ning-quick greens.</p>
    <p>“I have tried to re­mem­ber ev­ery dis­tance, like the dis­tance from tee box to a bunker. I will play with more con­fi­dence then,” he said. “The mem­ber gave me a lot of ad­vice. I think the greens will be fast and firm dur­ing the tour­na­ment and the weather could be cold es­pe­cially in the morn­ing... I’ll aim at the widest part of the fair­way, from where I will at­tack the green. I’ll care­fully study ev­ery pin po­si­tion ev­ery evening be­fore the round.”</p>
