    <p>•</p>
    <p>STOCK­HOLM Amer­i­can poet Louise Gluck won the 2020 Nobel Lit­er­a­ture Prize yes­ter­day, an un­ex­pected choice known for themes of child­hood and fam­ily life that draw in­spi­ra­tion from myths and classical mo­tifs.</p>
    <p>She was hon­oured “for her un­mis­tak­able po­etic voice that with aus­tere beauty makes in­di­vid­ual ex­is­tence uni­ver­sal”, the academy said. The award was an­nounced yes­ter­day at a Stock­holm news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Gluck at Yale Univer­sity, 77, is the first fe­male poet to win the prize since Pol­ish writer Wis­lawa Szym­borska in 1996. Other po­ets to have re­ceived the award in­clude Irish poet Sea­mus Heaney, who won in 1995.</p>
    <p>Prof Gluck is the first Amer­i­can to win since Bob Dylan in 2016. Her 12 col­lec­tions in­clude The Wild Iris, for which she won a Pulitzer Prize in 1993, and Faith­ful and Vir­tu­ous Night from 2014. She was named the US’ poet lau­re­ate in 2003.</p>
    <p>The Academy’s per­ma­nent sec­re­tary Mats Malm said he had spo­ken to Prof Gluck just be­fore mak­ing the pub­lic an­nounce­ment. “The mes­sage came as a sur­prise, but a wel­come one as far as I could tell,” he told re­porters.</p>
    <p>Prof Gluck was not seen as a favourite for the Nobel in the runup to yes­ter­day’s an­nounce­ment – though bet­ting sites’ odds on her re­port­edly plunged just be­fore the an­nounce­ment. The chair of the Academy’s Nobel com­mit­tee, Mr An­ders Ols­son, lamented that she was not more well-known, “at least out­side the United States’ bor­ders”, and had not been trans­lated into many other lan­guages.</p>
    <p>Last year, the academy was crit­i­cised af­ter it awarded the prize to Aus­trian au­thor and play­wrightPete­r Handke, who has been ac­cused of geno­cide de­nial for ques­tion­ing events dur­ing the Balkan Wars of the 1990s – in­clud­ing the Sre­brenica mas­sacre, in which about 8,000 Mus­lim men and boys were mur­dered.</p>
    <p>The prize, which dates to 1901, has been awarded to some of the world’s most in­flu­en­tial and revered nov­el­ists, po­ets and play­wrights. Prom­i­nent past lau­re­ates in­clude Toni Mor­ri­son, Kazuo Ishig­uro, Alice Munro, Gabriel Gar­cía Márquez, Saul Bel­low and Al­bert Ca­mus.</p>
    <p>The Nobel Prize in lit­er­a­ture, which is given for a writer’s en­tire body of work and is re­garded as per­haps the most pres­ti­gious lit­er­ary award in the world, comes with a prize of 10 mil­lion Swedish krona (S$1.5 mil­lion).</p>
