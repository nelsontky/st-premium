    <p>To visit ar­chi­tec­tural mas­ter­pieces is to wit­ness the eter­nal enigma of ev­ery­day skies that strides the majesty of stones and thoughts alike. Great Gothic cathe­drals, such as Chartres in France and the Duomo in Mi­lan, raise the ques­tion: Does ar­chi­tec­ture part­ner di­vine de­sign, or is it merely an ex­pres­sion of hu­man in­ge­nu­ity?</p>
    <p>It is both. It takes work to shape stones into thoughts. No place of wor­ship can be built with­out the labour of hu­man hands.</p>
    <p>Re­li­gious art in 13th-century France is the sub­ject of Emile</p>
    <p>Male’s The Gothic Image, a book that re­flects the lu­mi­nous great­ness of Chartres. Male says that the me­di­ae­val cathe­dral cel­e­brated not just con­tem­pla­tion but also work. In cathe­drals, “where all me­di­ae­val thought took vis­i­ble shape”, knowl­edge and man­ual labour were hon­oured equally. No one could have built Chartres (or the Duomo) for the im­mor­tal soul with­out hav­ing placed stone on inan­i­mate stone first.</p>
    <p>The Gothic style is jagged. It ap­pears episodic here, im­per­ti­nent there, in­com­pe­tent some­times, and in­com­plete al­ways, like ex­is­tence.</p>
    <p>To the eye, Gothic cathe­drals do not prom­ise a seam­less af­ter­life. In­stead, they present a world be­ing bro­ken, stone by stone, to lay the path­way to a rough and rest­less here­after. Un­like Baroque struc­tures, which are com­pleted pieces of di­vine geom­e­try, Gothic places of wor­ship do not seek to do­mes­ti­cate pass­ing ex­is­tence but to re­lease it in the wilds of the here­after.</p>
    <p>Art his­to­rian Arnold Hauser cap­tures the free­dom of that wild­ness when he speaks of a Gothic build­ing as mo­bil­is­ing the spec­ta­tor through “grad­ual ac­com­plish­ment”. “Such a build­ing can­not be taken in all at once from any pos­si­ble view­point; from no quar­ter does it present a com­plete, rest­ful view, dis­clos­ing the struc­ture of the whole,” he writes.</p>
    <p>“On the con­trary, it com­pels the spec­ta­tor to be con­stantly chang­ing his view­point and per­mits him to gain a pic­ture of the whole only through his own move­ment, action, and power of re­con­struc­tion.”</p>
    <p>The here­after is per­ma­nent, but al­tered an­gles of hu­man vi­sion gather its re­fracted hues here, light­ing the un­steady foot­steps of lives to­day.</p>
    <p>The Duomo drove in the point through a lift that took tourists to its roof. The mo­ment I got off the lift, I be­lieved that I had com­mit­ted a sac­ri­lege. Only the guardian-priests of the cathe­dral and its ar­ti­sanal re­pair­ers should have the right to set foot there, I thought. I was but a tourist, an in­truder, an in­ter­loper. What use was it to the Cre­ator to have me stand on hal­lowed ground?</p>
    <p>I was wrong. From the roof, I looked down to see the streets and the shops turned into a minia­ture world now. I looked up to the elu­sive close­ness of the skies.</p>
    <p>Sus­pended be­tween two worlds, I re­alised my pro­found in­signif­i­cance in the scheme of things. I could not buy a sin­gle trin­ket from a shop be­low: I could not touch a sin­gle cloud in the sky above. Atop the very Duomo, I was noth­ing. And I had taken a lift to reach the in­so­lent heights of my ir­rel­e­vance.</p>
    <p>The ar­ti­sans who had erected the Duomo taught me a last­ing les­son. I would not touch earth again eas­ily with­out the lift that their de­scen­dants had built for a fool like me.</p>
    <p>Such teach­ing never ends. The rock-cut caves of Ajanta and El­lora were a hum­bling in­vi­ta­tion to in­habit, if only for a few hours, the en­chanted com­mu­nion of Bud­dhism, Hin­duism and Jain­ism in In­dian ar­chi­tec­ture and art.</p>
    <p>The ma­jes­tic Kailasa Tem­ple, ded­i­cated to Lord Shiva, re­stored sight to souls coars­ened by use­less wan­der­ing. I won­dered whether the mon­u­men­tal ed­i­fices ex­isted only so that I could visit them. They did. Their mag­nif­i­cence had sur­vived the de­tri­tus of at­tri­tional time so that hu­mans like me could dis­cover our small­ness in their midst one day. It takes a cer­tain scale of achieved ex­is­tence to put the pre­sump­tu­ous in their pass­ing place.</p>
    <p>On my way out, I met lit­tle Radha. She was car­ry­ing stones be­ing quar­ried for an ar­chae­o­log­i­cal restora­tion project. Radha was not study­ing. “My par­ents are poor,” she said. “But if you give me some money, they may send me to school.”</p>
    <p>What a bright child, a true descen­dant of ar­ti­sans of the mind who built Ajanta and El­lora.</p>
    <p>I gave her a few ru­pees. She ran off with a laugh which re­ceded into the grandeur of tem­ples that strad­dled cen­turies gone and yet to come.</p>
    <p>She must be a young wo­man to­day. I do not know if she went to school but her girls, if any, must do so, so that equal­ity be­tween knowl­edge and man­ual labour in­cludes women as knowl­edge-work­ers.</p>
    <p>Once, when women were ex­cluded from the male world of paid work, the ul­ti­mate fight was be­tween men as thinkers and do­ers.</p>
    <p>Chartres rec­on­ciled them but the world out­side did not. Since then, women have in­vaded the re­warded realm of work, un­der­min­ing the gen­dered di­vi­sion of labour be­tween con­tem­pla­tion and man­ual labour.</p>
    <p>Men will have their use al­ways in a wo­man’s world. Emerg­ing from the mau­soleum of Per­sian poet and Sufi mys­tic Jalalud­din Rumi in Konya, I saw a group of Turk­ish school chil­dren. The girls and boys were walk­ing to the shrine, whose ap­proaches a man kept sweep­ing clean of the foot­prints of ear­lier en­trants. Su­fis stay true to their wan­der­ing selves as they dance their way through swirling chance. But some­one has to clean the floor here and now for the here­after.</p>
    <p>Most boys looked up at the ceil­ing. Many girls looked at the floor, sur­prised that a man should stoop to wel­come them to Rumi’s shrine.</p>
    <p>Last­ing ar­chi­tec­ture is pro­duced by the ea­ger labour of free minds.</p>
