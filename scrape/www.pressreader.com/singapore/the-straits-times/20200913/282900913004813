    <p>Q The Covid-19 pan­demic has forced many busi­nesses to re-eval­u­ate their fu­ture plans. This can also be said for in­di­vid­u­als as many take stock of what the fu­ture holds. So first tell us how has the cur­rent cli­mate changed the con­ver­sa­tions that you are hav­ing with clients at the mo­ment?</p>
    <p>A There has been a lot of un­cer­tainty and un­pre­dictabil­ity that has im­pacted ev­ery­one and our cus­tomers are no dif­fer­ent. This pe­riod has raised a lot of greater con­cerns.</p>
    <p>What we are see­ing in our con­ver­sa­tions with cus­tomers is that they are in­creas­ingly con­cerned about mak­ing sure that their cur­rent health and pro­tec­tion plans are suited to what they need.</p>
    <p>Iron­i­cally, this is a good time as well be­cause a lot of our dis­trac­tions are taken away now. There is no travel and there­fore we have time that can be used to as­sess where things are.</p>
    <p>We are see­ing an in­crease in our cus­tomers spend­ing time re­view­ing their cur­rent cov­er­age.</p>
    <p>Q Why is it im­por­tant to plan and think about wealth preser­va­tion dur­ing a time of cri­sis?</p>
    <p>A We en­cour­age our clients to look at their plans, for to­day and the fu­ture. It is to en­sure that you do not get th­ese up­heavals.</p>
    <p>So when we talk about wealth plan­ning with our cus­tomers, it goes be­yond wealth growth.</p>
    <p>But with high net worth in­di­vid­u­als, it is also about wealth preser­va­tion and wealth trans­fer. And it is think­ing about what the in­di­vid­u­als’ in­ten­tions are, es­pe­cially if they have a business and mul­ti­ple as­sets and they have chil­dren to whom they want to pass th­ese to.</p>
    <p>If I have three chil­dren, how do I make sure that it is equally di­vided so there is no con­flict within the fam­ily?</p>
    <p>There are about 190,000 mil­lion­aires in Sin­ga­pore to­day, and re­search shows that only one in five fam­i­lies has a wealth trans­fer plan.</p>
    <p>So what we do is to en­cour­age our cus­tomers to start plan­ning early and not wait till when there is a cri­sis. It is also about what you can do to­day that will impact to­mor­row, and pro­tect you bet­ter for to­mor­row, and when you have a fam­ily and mul­ti­ple as­sets.</p>
    <p>Whether it is real es­tate or a business, plan­ning ahead al­ways bodes well for the cus­tomer in terms of stat­ing his in­ten­tions and also iden­ti­fy­ing gaps and mak­ing sure that the plan is solid.</p>
    <p>Q What is the dif­fer­ence be­tween a wealth trans­fer plan and a will, and how does it dif­fer from a will?</p>
    <p>A Broadly speak­ing, they are very similar in the sense that they are both about pass­ing as­sets to your loved ones or in­di­vid­u­als whom you want to trans­fer your as­sets to.</p>
    <p>So in legacy plan­ning, our wealth plan­ners and pri­vate wealth con­sul­tants look at the client’s strat­egy from a holis­tic per­spec­tive.</p>
    <p>So it is about un­der­stand­ing the client’s needs and what he wants to achieve in the short-, medium- and long-term per­spec­tive.</p>
    <p>What are their i nten­tions in terms of wealth preser­va­tion and trans­fer of wealth?</p>
    <p>How do they want to pro­tect their wealth and al­lo­cate it to the next gen­er­a­tion or des­ig­nated heirs?</p>
    <p>And it is not just about trans­fer­ring to the next gen­er­a­tion when the in­di­vid­ual dies.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, we are liv­ing longer. The av­er­age life­span is now about 84 years.</p>
    <p>So legacy plan­ning also in­cor­po­rates el­e­ments around the key in­di­vid­ual, such as plan­ning for re­tire­ment or when they want to start mov­ing away from the business and leave it to the next gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Legacy plan­ning is a strat­egy for high net worth in­di­vid­u­als, be­cause they have mul­ti­ple as­sets in dif­fer­ent as­set classes.</p>
    <p>It is about tak­ing an in­te­grated look and a holis­tic ap­proach.</p>
    <p>And as an in­sur­ance provider, we be­lieve that in­sur­ance can play a crit­i­cal and holis­tic role in an in­te­grated plan for high net worth in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>Q What about the legacy that we want to leave be­hind? So, An­ge­line, is this some­thing that Pru­den­tial also guides its clients, for ex­am­ple, via phil­an­thropic do­na­tions?</p>
    <p>A Ab­so­lutely.</p>
    <p>We are guided by where the clients show in­ter­est and de­sire, and we are start­ing to see more and more high net worth cus­tomers start­ing to in­cor­po­rate phi­lan­thropy into their legacy plan.</p>
    <p>And so we are start­ing to see sec­ond, third gen­er­a­tions com­ing through in terms of wealth trans­fer.</p>
    <p>And we are start­ing to see a lot of th­ese cus­tomers, whether they are the orig­i­nal business own­ers or not, want­ing to give back to so­ci­ety be­cause they feel that the com­mu­nity</p>
    <p>has given them so much and helped them to be suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>They want to give back and pay it for­ward.</p>
    <p>We are also start­ing to see that even in the next gen­er­a­tion – they may not be much in­ter­ested in the fam­ily business, but wish to con­trib­ute and do some­thing no­ble to carry on the fam­ily’s legacy.</p>
    <p>Q So for those of us look­ing to make those first steps in our wealth plan­ning jour­ney, what should we con­sider and think about?</p>
    <p>A As with ev­ery­thing, start with a plan. And I think that the main thing is to in­di­cate what your in­ten­tions are, in the short, medium and long term.</p>
    <p>What do you want to achieve from a legacy plan and how you want to start to think about that whole wealth preser­va­tion as well as wealth trans­fer ob­jec­tives that you want to achieve.</p>
    <p>And so plan­ning and sit­ting down with a pri­vate wealth con­sul­tant help to crys­tallise that plan and in­cor­po­rate an in­te­grated ap­proach.</p>
    <p>The good thing about how we have set up our business is that our ap­proach is very needs-based and very ad­vi­sory-led.</p>
    <p>While we are the in­sur­ance ex­pert, we ac­knowl­edge that cus­tomers like the high net worth in­di­vid­u­als would re­quire some­thing broader. We have spe­cial­ists in dif­fer­ent fields, and trust fam­ily of­fices, tax and other ar­eas of spe­cial­i­sa­tion that we can bring in to help with those con­ver­sa­tions for the cus­tomer.</p>
    <p>So it is about plan­ning and plan­ning now. If you have a plan right now, it is never too late to start.</p>
    <p>Q When you deal with ul­tra high net worth in­di­vid­u­als, it is of­ten re­la­tion­ship-based. Have you ad­justed your of­fer­ings given the cur­rent en­vi­ron­ment?</p>
    <p>A I think pre­cisely be­cause it is re­la­tion­ship-based, our key fo­cus is about ac­tively lis­ten­ing to what the cus­tomers want and need.</p>
    <p>So our ap­proach re­mains largely the same be­cause our ap­proach has al­ways been very needs-based and ad­vi­sory-led.</p>
    <p>It is about iden­ti­fy­ing what the cus­tomers are see­ing as po­ten­tial gaps, maybe in their plans, and ar­eas that they would like to start to plan and tighten up.</p>
    <p>So, for ex­am­ple, high net worth clients might view that from a pro­tec­tion per­spec­tive – there might not be enough cov­er­age for what they want to achieve fur­ther down the road.</p>
    <p>I can­not stress the im­por­tance of the plan­ning and ob­vi­ously the re­view­ing of those plans.</p>
    <p>As I said, be­cause a lot of dis­trac­tions have been taken away from us now that we do not travel, I think cus­tomers are spend­ing a lot more time with us to start think­ing about th­ese el­e­ments.</p>
