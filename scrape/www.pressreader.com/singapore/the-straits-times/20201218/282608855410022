    <p>Ev­ery brand is do­ing it... but Patek is not do­ing it yet. Maybe in two or three or 10 years.</p>
    <p>MR THIERRY STERN, pres­i­dent of Patek Philippe, on e-com­merce and sell­ing watches on­line</p>
    <p>Covid-19 may be giv­ing many head hon­chos of lux­ury watch brands frown lines and fur­rowed brows. Not Mr Thierry Stern.</p>
    <p>The pres­i­dent of Patek Philippe was chirpy and full of beans in a re­cent Zoom in­ter­view from the Swiss watch­maker’s new US$600 mil­lion (S$797 mil­lion), 10-storey man­u­fac­tur­ing fa­cil­ity in Plan-lesOu­ates on the out­skirts of Geneva.</p>
    <p>Pro­duc­tion is down 30 per cent, he said can­didly.</p>
    <p>“I’m still happy with that be­cause many brands will dream to be in our sit­u­a­tion,” added the 49-year-old cor­po­rate leader, whose com­pany makes 62,000 time­pieces a year.</p>
    <p>The rev­enue of Patek, one of the most suc­cess­ful watch brands in the world, was es­ti­mated by Ger­man bank Beren­berg last year to be 1.5 bil­lion Swiss francs (S$2.3 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>Buy­ing a pop­u­lar Patek model like the Nautilus or Aqua­naut en­tails get­ting on a wait­ing list of sev­eral years.</p>
    <p>Its time­pieces also reg­u­larly fetch high prices at auc­tions and the re­sale mar­ket. A steel Nautilus which cost US$3,000 when it was re­leased in the 1970s can set one back by more than US$50,000 now.</p>
    <p>Be­ing hit by a pan­demic was some­thing Mr Stern did not ex­pect, but was pre­pared for.</p>
    <p>“Fi­nan­cially, I have enough money in the re­serves to an­tic­i­pate that. We are very strong. We don’t have any share­hold­ers,” he said of the 181-year-old fam­ily busi­ness he took over from his fa­ther in 2009.</p>
    <p>“What­ever money we have, I pre­fer to rein­vest in Patek. I’m not go­ing to buy 200 Rolls-Royces or Fer­raris. But I do have a Mini – it’s eas­ier to park,” he quipped.</p>
    <p>Sav­ing money for a rainy day was some­thing his fa­ther – Philippe Stern – drummed into him.</p>
    <p>“My dad had to face sev­eral crises and he al­ways told me: ‘We need to have re­serves, we need to an­tic­i­pate a cri­sis... When some­thing like this hap­pens, it comes very quickly.’”</p>
    <p>The pan­demic also did not dis­rupt the com­pany’s plans to roll out one of the year’s most-talked­about watches last month – the Patek Philippe Ref. 6301P Grand Son­nerie.</p>
    <p>One of the most dif­fi­cult com­pli­ca­tions to make, a grand son­nerie au­to­mat­i­cally chimes the hours and quar­ter hours.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to the grand son­nerie, the Ref. 6301P – which took five years of re­search and de­vel­op­ment</p>
    <p>– also boasts a petite son­nerie, a minute re­peater and patented jump­ing sub­sidiary sec­onds.</p>
    <p>It is the first Patek Philippe time­piece which boasts mul­ti­ple chim­ing com­pli­ca­tions not com­bined with any other large-scale com­pli­ca­tion. The move­ment has 703 parts housed in a 44.8mm plat­inum case.</p>
    <p>Asked why he launched such a grand watch – it comes with a price tag of 1.15 mil­lion Swiss francs – at such a dif­fi­cult time, Mr Stern said: “The in­dus­try will al­ways have good and bad years and we should not stop.”</p>
    <p>“When I be­came pres­i­dent, it was also a very bad year,” he added, re­fer­ring to the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis of 2009. “But when you’re ready with some­thing, you shouldn’t wait be­cause you have no idea how long the sit­u­a­tion will last.”</p>
    <p>There were other rea­sons why he went ahead with the launch.</p>
    <p>It is not a watch pro­duced in large quan­ti­ties. The price, he added, will not de­ter its cus­tomers, many of whom are true watch lovers.</p>
    <p>“This will be in our col­lec­tion for many years. The launch of such a piece gives a lot of hope and hap­pi­ness (dur­ing this time),” he said.</p>
    <p>He also wanted to hon­our his fa­ther, whose 82nd birth­day fell on Nov 10.</p>
    <p>Known to be per­son­ally in­volved in ev­ery chim­ing watch the brand makes, Mr Stern said the Ref. 6301P is a labour of love.</p>
    <p>He was fas­tid­i­ous about its ex­e­cu­tion, push­ing his ar­ti­sans to come up with a watch which is not only ac­cu­rate, but also sounds beau­ti­ful.</p>
    <p>A good chim­ing watch, he said, should have the per­fect bal­ance of vol­ume, har­mony and sound.</p>
    <p>He re­mem­bers learn­ing to cer­tify chim­ing watches with his fa­ther when he started out in the busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“We’d lis­ten to five sounds and he would find so many dif­fer­ences. It was scary be­cause I thought to my­self: ‘One day, I would have to do it with­out him.’ Now, it’s easy, hav­ing fol­lowed him for so long.”</p>
    <p>This year is also mem­o­rable for him be­cause Patek moved into its new pro­duc­tion fa­cil­ity and did it just be­fore the virus hit.</p>
    <p>“To­day, it is too big for us. But to­mor­row, we will need the space. With this build­ing, I will have the space to an­tic­i­pate the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>The fa­ther of two teenage boys added: “I would like to give the best op­por­tu­ni­ties to my sons to de­velop Patek in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve in Patek. In the fu­ture, it will still be here and stronger.”</p>
