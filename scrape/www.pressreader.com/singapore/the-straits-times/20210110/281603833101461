    <p>WASH­ING­TON • A state law­maker from West Vir­ginia, a 70-year-old Alabamian armed with j ars of petrol and a man who broke into Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s of­fice and posed at her desk were among those charged af­ter the storm­ing of the United States Capi­tol.</p>
    <p>The US Jus­tice De­part­ment an­nounced on Fri­day that it has charged 15 people in­volved in the as­sault on Congress, in­clud­ing one man ac­cused of pos­sess­ing bombs made to act like “home­made na­palm”.</p>
    <p>But Mr Ken Kohl, a fed­eral pros­e­cu­tor with the Wash­ing­ton US at­tor­ney’s of­fice, said they did not ex­pect to charge any­one with “in­cite­ment” or “in­sur­rec­tion” in last Wed­nes­day’s vi­o­lence, amid calls for le­gal ac­tion against Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, his lawyer Rudy Gi­u­liani and oth­ers for en­cour­ag­ing it.</p>
    <p>The de­part­ment un­veiled the cases against 13 of the in­di­vid­u­als, in­clud­ing Richard Bar­nett, a Trump sup­porter who in­vaded the of­fice of Ms Pelosi; and Lon­nie Coff­man of Alabama, who was found car­ry­ing two hand­guns and had 11 sty­ro­foam-en­hanced Molo­tov cock­tails in his truck.</p>
    <p>Bar­nett, fa­mously pho­tographed with his feet on a desk in Ms Pelosi’s of­fice, was charged with theft of sta­tionery.</p>
    <p>Also charged was Der­rick Evans, a newly elected law­maker from West Vir­ginia. Evans posted a video on his Face­book page of him­self as he stood among the crowd out­side a Capi­tol door, shout­ing, “There we go! Open the door!” and chant­ing, “Our House! Our House!” be­fore rush­ing in­side.</p>
    <p>Though he deleted the video, the Fed­eral Bu­reau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion (FBI) found a copy on Red­dit.</p>
    <p>Most of the 13 were charged with il­le­gal en­try into re­stricted build­ings of Congress, and vi­o­lent or dis­or­derly con­duct.</p>
    <p>They were also charged with im­ped­ing govern­ment func­tions af­ter forc­ing the shut­down of a joint ses­sion of Congress to of­fi­cially cer­tify that Mr Joe Bi­den had won the Nov 3 elec­tion, which Mr Trump had un­til last Thurs­day re­fused to ac­cept.</p>
    <p>“The law­less de­struc­tion of the</p>
    <p>US Capi­tol build­ing was an at­tack against one of our na­tion’s great­est in­sti­tu­tions,” said Act­ing US At­tor­ney Michael Sher­win.</p>
    <p>Mr Kohl said that not all the charges filed over last Wed­nes­day’s vi­o­lence had been un­sealed, and that more were in the pipe­line as the FBI in­ves­ti­gates.</p>
    <p>“This in­ves­ti­ga­tion has the high­est pri­or­ity,” he said, adding that “hun­dreds” of Jus­tice De­part­ment in­ves­ti­ga­tors were work­ing on the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of ar­rests is likely to grow quickly as in­ves­ti­ga­tors pore over social me­dia to iden­tify rioters.</p>
    <p>Around 40 people were ar­rested</p>
    <p>and charged by lo­cal Wash­ing­ton po­lice, mostly for cur­few vi­o­la­tions, weapons of­fences and un­law­ful en­try. But the charges an­nounced by Mr Kohl on Fri­day were on the fed­eral level and po­ten­tially carry heftier pun­ish­ment.</p>
    <p>Some people have called for Mr Trump, Mr Gi­u­liani, Mr Trump’s son Don­ald Jr and oth­ers to be charged with in­cite­ment for openly en­cour­ag­ing the Pres­i­dent’s sup­port­ers to take ac­tion just hours be­fore the mob stormed the Capi­tol.</p>
    <p>“We don’t ex­pect any charges of that na­ture,” Mr Kohl said.</p>
