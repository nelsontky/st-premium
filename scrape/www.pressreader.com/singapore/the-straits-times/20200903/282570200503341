    <p>To­wards the end of her in­ter­view with Elvin Ng, host Quan Yifeng gets the ac­tor, who has of­ten been crit­i­cised for his muf­fled Man­darin pro­nun­ci­a­tion, to read aloud a string of words all pro­nounced as “shi” in dif­fer­ent tones.</p>
    <p>He passes the test.</p>
    <p>Ng is then made to read from an­other pas­sage, this time an English one pep­pered with words such as “bit­ter”, “bit­ten” and “bit­tern”.</p>
    <p>A laugh­ing Quan ex­claims: “All I hear is the name of my ex-hus­band (ac­tor Peter Yu).” She asks her un­seen pro­duc­tion staff: “Are you guys mak­ing fun of me or him?”</p>
    <p>For this weekly talk show fea­tur­ing celebrity guests, vet­eran host Quan is not afraid of bring­ing up her colour­ful past (her tur­bu­lent relationsh­ip with Yu has of­ten been tabloid fod­der) for laughs.</p>
    <p>Nor does she shy away from lever­ag­ing her insider knowl­edge or per­sonal re­la­tion­ships with in­ter­vie­wees to get them to open up.</p>
    <p>This makes Hear U Out a gem for those cu­ri­ous about the gos­sip and per­son­al­i­ties of the lo­cal Chi­nese en­ter­tain­ment scene.</p>
    <p>In her in­ter­view with Ng, for in­stance, Quan jok­ingly refers to him as her “lover” and re­counts how her daugh­ter, ac­tress Eleanor Lee, once re­vealed that Quan is such a big fan of Ng that she shouts when she sees him on tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>With Ng suit­ably dis­armed, Quan sud­denly places a clas­sic dilemma in front of the 39-year-old: If Quan and ac­tor Romeo Tan – Ng’s good friend – fell into wa­ter, whom would he save first?</p>
    <p>Else­where, Quan gets ac­tress Jeanette Aw re­laxed enough to say in a mat­ter-of-fact tone that she has no friends in the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try, as she does not mince her words.</p>
    <p>A teary Aw also let on that she was dis­ap­pointed that she did not win Best Ac­tress at the Star Awards for The Lit­tle Ny­onya (2008) – it went in­stead to her co-star Joanne Peh.</p>
    <p>Like Aw, sev­eral in­ter­vie­wees have shed tears on Quan’s couch.</p>
    <p>Ac­tress Car­rie Wong, re­cently seen in time-travel pe­riod drama A Quest To Heal, got emo­tional when she re­counted the scan­dal last year over leaked per­sonal mes­sages between her and ac­tor Ian Fang.</p>
    <p>One of the best episodes is the one fea­tur­ing fel­low host Kym Ng, who, like Quan, is not afraid to laugh at her­self.</p>
    <p>Ng re­counts var­i­ous gaffes in her host­ing ca­reer, be it mis­pro­nounc­ing a word or spout­ing a woolly state­ment in re­sponse to Tai­wanese singer</p>
    <p>Tsai Chin’s com­ment about how she was no role model, as her mar­riage had failed.</p>
    <p>Ng, an air stew­ardess be­fore be­com­ing a TV host, also sport­ingly re­vealed how she was re­jected in her nu­mer­ous ap­pli­ca­tions to be­come an air stew­ardess be­fore a few other ap­pli­cants took pity on her and taught her how to ap­ply make-up.</p>
    <p>At its best, the talk show peels off the glam­our of show busi­ness to show the toil and strug­gles of its celebrity guests.</p>
    <p>Or you can just watch it to find out who gets on with whom.</p>
    <p>In South Korean cor­rup­tion drama Stranger, the so­cially awk­ward pros­e­cu­tor Hwang Shi-mok (Cho Se­ung-woo) is a lone wolf who nev­er­the­less works well with free-spir­ited de­tec­tive Han Yeo-jin (Bae Doona).</p>
    <p>The strange cou­ple re­turn for the sec­ond sea­son of the crit­i­cally ac­claimed tvN drama, but are on op­pos­ing sides as the prose­cu­tors and po­lice face off in a turf war.</p>
    <p>Join­ing the cast this sea­son is Jeon Hye-jin, who was last seen in K-drama WWW (2019) and looks to have cor­nered the mar­ket in play­ing women in lead­er­ship po­si­tions. She plays Choi Bit, Yeo-jin’s boss at the Na­tional Po­lice Agency.</p>
    <p>Also new is Choi Moo-sung (Arth­dal Chron­i­cles, 2019), who plays Shi-mok’s thug­gish boss, chief pros­e­cu­tor Woo Tae-ha.</p>
    <p>Shi-mok and Yeo-jin are caught up in the pol­i­tick­ing of their re­spec­tive bosses. In one pow­er­ful scene, a cor­ri­dor in­side a gov­ern­ment build­ing be­comes a box­ing ring of sorts, with Shi-mok and his boss stand­ing in one cor­ner, star­ing down Yeo-jin and her boss in the op­po­site cor­ner.</p>
    <p>Shi-mok and Yeo-jin may seem droll and colour­less, but both stand out as pure-hearted souls un­moved by money or power and dogged in their pur­suit of the truth.</p>
    <p>With its mul­ti­ple plot lines hard to dis­en­tan­gle, things get off to a slug­gish start in the sec­ond sea­son, but the odd cou­ple at the heart of this show re­main a po­tent draw.</p>
