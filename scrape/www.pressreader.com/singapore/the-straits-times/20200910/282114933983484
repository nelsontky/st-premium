    <p>Two men were charged in court yes­ter­day with ac­cept­ing bribes amount­ing to over $25,000 in to­tal while su­per­vis­ing work at an oil blend­ing plant in Jalan Buroh near West Coast Road.</p>
    <p>Neo Gim Ch­wee and Cheow Hock Mun, both 48, al­legedly ob­tained the bribes from Lim Gim Chuan, the di­rec­tor of LGC Engi­neer­ing & Con­trac­tors.</p>
    <p>Both men were to “ex­er­cise le­niency” in their su­per­vi­sion of work done by the engi­neer­ing firm, ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>Lim was sen­tenced to 10 weeks’ jail in June for his in­volve­ment.</p>
    <p>Neo, who faces four charges of cor­rup­tion, is ac­cused of ac­cept­ing $5,000 from Lim four times be­tween May 2015 and Fe­bru­ary 2016.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments said he was a project man­ager at an­other engi­neer­ing firm, Hiap Seng Engi­neer­ing (HSE), at the time of the of­fences.</p>
    <p>The Cor­rupt Prac­tices In­ves­ti­ga­tion Bu­reau had said in an ear­lier state­ment that LGC was a sub-con­trac­tor of HSE for civil engi­neer­ing works at the Chevron Sin­ga­pore Lube Oil Blend­ing Plant.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that the plant is owned by Chevron Sin­ga­pore, an oil com­pany for­merly known as Cal­tex Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Neo is also charged with one count of cheat­ing HSE by dis­hon­estly con­ceal­ing the fact that LGC had passed him $10,000 meant for his com­pany in July 2015. He is due back in court on Oct 7.</p>
    <p>Cheow, a Malaysian who faces three charges of cor­rup­tion, is ac­cused of ac­cept­ing a $2,000 bribe from Lim three times be­tween April and July 2015.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments said he was work­ing as a health, en­vi­ron­ment and safety spe­cial­ist at Chevron Sin­ga­pore at the time of the of­fences.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Cheow in­di­cated in court that he would plead guilty to the of­fences. His case was ad­journed to Oct 9.</p>
    <p>If found guilty, each man can be jailed for up to five years and/or fined up to $100,000 for each cor­rup­tion-re­lated of­fence. They can also be or­dered to pay a penalty equal to the amount of the bribes re­ceived.</p>
    <p>Neo can also be jailed for up to three years and/or fined if con­victed of cheat­ing .</p>
