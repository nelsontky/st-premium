    <p>The com­pact pre­mium sedan seg­ment is dom­i­nated by cars like the Mercedes-Benz C-class, BMW 3-se­ries, Audi A4 and Lexus IS.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish car­maker Jaguar launched the XE sedan in 2015 to com­pete in this seg­ment, but it did not make a ma­jor sales im­pact here.</p>
    <p>Hope­fully, the facelifted car can make a big­ger splash.</p>
    <p>The ex­te­rior changes are sub­tle, with new de­signs for the bumpers, head­lights, tail lights and rims. With its aero­dy­namic pro­file and dis­tinc­tive road pres­ence, the XE is pretty good-look­ing to be­gin with, so these tweaks are just ic­ing on the cake.</p>
    <p>The changes un­der the bon­net and in­side the car are more sub­stan­tial. The en­gine puts out 47bhp and 85Nm more, trans­lat­ing to a sig­nif­i­cant per­for­mance boost.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with its pre­de­ces­sor, the XE is 1.2 sec­onds quicker in the cen­tury sprint (6.5 ver­sus 7.7 sec­onds) and has a higher top speed (250 ver­sus 237kmh). The car’s zero-to-100kmh tim­ing now places it in the hot-hatch zone, nearly match­ing the Volk­swa­gen GTI’s 6.4 sec­onds.</p>
    <p>In­side, the cock­pit gets a thor­ough makeover. A joy­stick shift lever from the F-type sports car re­places its pop-up ro­tary trans­mis­sion switch. The in­fo­tain­ment touch­screen dis­play is now two inches big­ger at 10 inches, and its in­stru­ment panel is now fully digi­tised with a 12.3-inch screen.</p>
    <p>The most im­pres­sive in­te­rior up­grade is the rear-view mir­ror cam­era sys­tem. The XE’s rear-view mir­ror has two modes: reg­u­lar mode and a rear cam­era mode, where flip­ping a switch be­low the mir­ror turns on a cam­era mounted on the shark fin an­tenna.</p>
    <p>I found the wide-an­gle high-def­i­ni­tion dis­play use­ful, even when it rained. It proved use­ful in dim light­ing too. I was driv­ing at night when a Toy­ota pulled up from be­hind. Even though it did not have its head­lights on, the cam­era picked it up, and I could even see the pri­vate­hire sticker on its wind­screen.</p>
    <p>The XE comes with four drive modes: Com­fort, Eco, Dy­namic and Rain Ice Snow.</p>
    <p>The test car did not come with adap­tive sus­pen­sion (a $3,000 op­tion), so the Dy­namic mode pri­mar­ily sharp­ens throt­tle re­sponse, in­creases steer­ing weight and de­lays up­shift­ing un­til higher en­gine speeds. I tog­gled among the var­i­ous modes and set­tled mostly on the Dy­namic mode. Even in this mode, the XE main­tains the cushy ride that Jaguar cars are famed for.</p>
    <p>But driv­ing al­most ex­clu­sively in Dy­namic mode af­fected the fuel con­sump­tion. I av­er­aged about 10 litres/100km against the of­fi­cial fig­ure of 7.2 litres/100km.</p>
    <p>The XE has a pared-down ver­sion at $12,000 less. It does not have fea­tures such as the blindspot de­tec­tion, rearview mir­ror-cam­era, pow­ered tail­gate and mem­ory seats. But that still makes it about $10,000 more ex­pen­sive than the en­trylevel Mercedes C160 and Audi A4.</p>
    <p>The top-of-the-range XE may be priced at about the same level as the en­try-level BMW 318i, but some may still see it as not hav­ing as high a badge ap­peal as the BMW. This ex­plains why the BMW 320i sells bet­ter than the XE, even though it costs more.</p>
    <p>Therein lies the dilemma of the XE: It matches the per­for­mance and equip­ment of its Ger­man ri­vals, but it is seen by main­stream buy­ers as less de­sir­able than them.</p>
    <p>But for oth­ers who are less con­cerned about brand­ing, the XE can be a com­pelling prepo­si­tion. If there are more of such buy­ers, the re­freshed car will have a bet­ter chance at sales success here than its pre­de­ces­sor.</p>

        <p data-role="text">The Jaguar XE (above) has up&#xAD;dated its bumpers, head&#xAD;lights, tail lights and rims. The most im&#xAD;pres&#xAD;sive in&#xAD;te&#xAD;rior up&#xAD;grade is the rear-view mir&#xAD;ror cam&#xAD;era sys&#xAD;tem (be&#xAD;low), which has two modes: reg&#xAD;u&#xAD;lar mode and a rear cam&#xAD;era mode where flip&#xAD;ping a switch be&#xAD;low the mir&#xAD;ror turns on a cam&#xAD;era mounted on the shark fin an&#xAD;tenna.</p>
