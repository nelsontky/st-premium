    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s non-oil do­mes­tic ex­ports (Nodx) saw a sur­prise drop last month for a sec­ond straight month. The fall was led by ship­ments of petro­chem­i­cals, phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals and non-mone­tary gold, fol­lowed by elec­tron­ics.</p>
    <p>Nodx de­clined 4.9 per cent year on year last month af­ter a 3.1 per cent fall in Oc­to­ber, En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG) said yes­ter­day. Sin­ga­pore had recorded four con­sec­u­tive months of Nodx growth be­fore the drop in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>The fall in last month’s ex­ports dashed hopes of a re­cov­ery from Oc­to­ber’s de­cline. Econ­o­mists in a Bloomberg sur­vey had fore­cast a 0.3 per cent year-on-year gain.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts said the dis­ap­point­ing data high­lights the up­ward trudge global trade faces next year and the pos­si­bil­ity of Sin­ga­pore miss­ing its of­fi­cial fore­cast for Nodx to grow by 4 per cent to 4.5 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank econ­o­mist Howie Lee said the high base in last year’s fourth quar­ter means Nodx per­for­mance this quar­ter would most likely be muted com­pared with the stronger growth num­bers seen for much of this year.</p>
    <p>“With un­cer­tainty over global eco­nomic re­cov­ery still high, we firmly ex­pect risks to Nodx growth in the com­ing year to be tilted to the down­side,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee pre­dicted that Nodx this month will de­cline by 1.3 per cent year on year, which may bring the full-year per­for­mance to an ex­pan­sion of 3.6 per cent – less than the ESG fore­cast. He said OCBC’s es­ti­mate is 1 per cent year-on-year Nodx growth next year – pred­i­cated on suc­cess­ful vac­cine de­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>United Over­seas Bank se­nior econ­o­mist Alvin Liew main­tained his view for Nodx to grow 4 per cent this year, though the re­cent weak­ness has in­creased the risk that ful­lyear ex­pan­sion will be closer to the lower bound of the ESG fore­cast. “With the ex­pec­ta­tions of a vac­cine-driven re­cov­ery in global de­mand, we are cau­tiously op­ti­mistic that Nodx will ex­pand in 2021.”</p>
    <p>Last month’s elec­tronic ex­ports fell 3.8 per cent, fol­low­ing a 0.5 per cent drop in Oc­to­ber. In­te­grated cir­cuits (ICs), disk me­dia prod­ucts and per­sonal com­puter (PC) parts con­trib­uted most to the fall.</p>
    <p>IC ex­ports fell 7.9 per cent, disk me­dia prod­ucts dropped by 9.7 per cent and PC parts were down 12.1 per cent. The de­cline in IC ex­ports was much steeper in Novem­ber last year, when they fell 37 per cent.</p>
    <p>Non-elec­tronic ship­ments dropped 5.2 per cent, af­ter a 4 per cent fall in Oc­to­ber. Petro­chem­i­cals, phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals and non­mon­e­tary gold con­trib­uted most to the de­cline in non-elec­tronic Nodx.</p>
    <p>Petro­chem­i­cal ex­ports fell 18.5 per cent amid sub­dued de­mand. The typ­i­cally volatile phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals dropped 13.4 per cent and non-mone­tary gold, 15.1 per cent.</p>
    <p>Though the pace of de­cline for gold eased from Oc­to­ber, when it fell by 61 per cent, de­mand for the pre­cious metal has eased since its in­ter­na­tional price peaked in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>How­ever, on a month-on-month and sea­son­ally ad­justed ba­sis, Nodx last month rose 3.8 per cent, af­ter the pre­vi­ous month’s 5.4 per cent de­cline and an 11.4 per cent con­trac­tion in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Some an­a­lysts be­lieve the month-on-month gain sug­gests that the global de­mand for goods may have started to sta­bilise.</p>
    <p>Mr Sin Beng Ong, an an­a­lyst at JPMor­gan Chase Bank’s Sin­ga­pore branch, said the month-on-month gain should broaden into next year.</p>
    <p>“The monthly ebb and flow of Sin­ga­pore’s Nodx tends to be noisy, due in part to... volatil­ity in phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals. How­ever, in trend terms, the un­der­ly­ing re­cov­ery in goods de­mand should con­tinue... and un­der­pins our view of a grad­ual re­cov­ery through next year,” he said.</p>
    <p>Nodx to top mar­kets as a whole de­clined last month, though ex­ports to the United States, Ja­pan, Tai­wan, Malaysia, Thai­land and Hong Kong grew. The largest con­trib­u­tors to the de­cline in l ast month’s Nodx were China, the Euro­pean Union and In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>To­tal trade fell by 8.7 per cent year on year last month, fol­low­ing the 9 per cent drop in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>To­tal ex­ports shrank by 8 per cent, fol­low­ing Oc­to­ber’s 8.7 per cent de­cline. To­tal im­ports de­clined by 9.4 per cent af­ter the 9.3 per cent de­crease in Oc­to­ber.</p>
