    <p>WASHINGTON • Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump plans to rep­re­sent the United States at the virtual Asi­aPa­cific lead­ers’ sum­mit to­day in which his Chi­nese coun­ter­part Xi Jin­ping is set to par­tic­i­pate, a US of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s par­tic­i­pa­tion in the Asia-Pa­cific Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion (Apec) fo­rum hosted vir­tu­ally by Malaysia to­day will be his first since 2017, the only time he has par­tic­i­pated.</p>
    <p>The news comes af­ter Mr Trump’s out­go­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion faced crit­i­cism for lower-level par­tic­i­pa­tion at last week­end’s virtual East Asia Sum­mit, on the side­lines of which 15 coun­tries signed a ma­jor China-backed re­gional trade deal.</p>
    <p>“Potus is do­ing Apec,” said a US of­fi­cial, who did not want to be iden­ti­fied, us­ing the acro­nym for the Pres­i­dent of the United States.</p>
    <p>The White House de­clined to com­ment and while the cur­rent plan is for Mr Trump to take part in Apec, the Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent is pre­oc­cu­pied with an up­hill bat­tle to con­test his de­feat in the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>In the past, he has changed his mind about tak­ing part in such meet­ings.</p>
    <p>China’s Pres­i­dent Xi is sched­uled to be among the par­tic­i­pants in to­day’s Apec lead­ers’ meet­ing, af­ter he ad­dressed a chief ex­ec­u­tives’ con­fer­ence yesterday.</p>
    <p>Last year’s Apec sum­mit, which Mr Trump had been due to at­tend, did not take place be­cause Chile backed out of host­ing it amid vi­o­lent street protests.</p>
    <p>Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence rep­re­sented the US at Apec in 2018 amid height­ened US-China ten­sions, which have de­te­ri­o­rated since to their worst l evel i n decades.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump failed in his re-elec­tion bid af­ter a cam­paign that high­lighted ri­valry with China, although he has re­fused to con­cede de­feat.</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic ri­val and Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den is due to take over on Jan 20.</p>
    <p>The Apec event is be­ing held vir­tu­ally t his year due to t he Covid-19 pandemic, which has hit the US hard­est and which Mr Trump has blamed on China.</p>
    <p>An Amer­i­can of­fi­cial in charge of Apec said last week the US had yet to de­cide who would at­tend the lead­ers’ meet­ing, sug­gest­ing that Mr Xi would take the spot­light at a time of steadily in­creas­ing Chi­nese in­flu­ence across Asia.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s East Asia Sum­mit no-show was viewed by many an­a­lysts as a snub even though his ad­min­is­tra­tion had de­clared the Asia-Pa­cific and com­pe­ti­tion with China a for­eign pol­icy pri­or­ity.</p>
