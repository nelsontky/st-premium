    <p>GENEVA/LON­DON • Some 156 na­tions have joined a global scheme for fair distri­bu­tion of fu­ture vac­cines against Covid-19, an al­liance led by the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) has said, but su­per­pow­ers China and the United States did not sign up.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s gov­ern­ment has al­ready se­cured fu­ture sup­plies through bi­lat­eral deals, prompt­ing ac­cu­sa­tions of self­ish be­hav­iour to the detri­ment of poor coun­tries.</p>
    <p>China, where the coro­n­avirus out­break be­gan, was also miss­ing from the list of 64 rich na­tions that joined the so-called Co­vax plan to de­liver two bil­lion vac­cine doses round the world by the end of next year, pri­ori­tis­ing health­care work­ers and the vul­ner­a­ble. But al­liance of­fi­cials said di­a­logue con­tin­ued with Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>The scheme would ac­count for about two-thirds of the world pop­u­la­tion, ac­cord­ing to the WHO and Gavi vac­cine al­liance, which on Mon­day pub­lished the list of sig­na­to­ries af­ter a dead­line for bind­ing com­mit­ments ex­pired last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Dozens of vac­cines are in test­ing for the coro­n­avirus, which has in­fected about 31 mil­lion peo­ple glob­ally and killed nearly one mil­lion, a fifth of those in the US.</p>
    <p>“Co­vax will give the world the largest and most di­verse port­fo­lio of vac­cine can­di­dates,” WHO direc­torgen­eral Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus said at a vir­tual brief­ing.</p>
    <p>“This is not char­ity, it’s in ev­ery coun­try’s best in­ter­est. We sink or we swim to­gether... This is not just the right thing to do, it’s the smart thing to do.”</p>
    <p>With some wealth­ier na­tions ret­i­cent over Co­vax, the plan has high­lighted the chal­lenge of dis­tribut­ing vac­cines eq­ui­tably around a world of haves and have-nots.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine al­liance said it ex­pected an­other 38 wealthy coun­tries to join the ini­tia­tive in the com­ing days.</p>
