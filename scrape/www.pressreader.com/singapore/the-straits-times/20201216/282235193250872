    <p>The pri­vate res­i­den­tial mar­ket re­sumed its up­ward march last month, with sales up nearly 19 per cent month on month fol­low­ing a 225 per cent surge in the num­ber of new homes launched.</p>
    <p>Last month’s uptick in sales to 767 units, from 645 in Oc­to­ber, fol­lowed a tem­po­rary pull­back in Oc­to­ber’s sales af­ter the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Author­ity (URA) clamped down on the reis­sue of op­tions to pur­chase (OTPs).</p>
    <p>The URA fig­ures re­leased yes­ter­day ex­clude ex­ec­u­tive con­do­minium (EC) units, which are a pub­lic-pri­vate hous­ing hy­brid.</p>
    <p>If ECs are in­cluded, 815 new pri­vate homes were sold last month, up nearly 19 per cent from Oc­to­ber and down 31.3 per cent from a year ear­lier. No EC units were launched last month.</p>
    <p>OrangeTee & Tie head of re­search and con­sul­tancy Chris­tine Sun said: “Novem­ber’s healthy sales in­di­cate that not all seg­ments of the mar­ket were af­fected by the new curbs on the reis­su­ing of OTPs. There are many gen­uine buy­ers who can af­ford a pri­vate home with­out ap­ply­ing for an OTP ex­ten­sion.”</p>
    <p>She said vac­cine op­ti­mism has bol­stered in­vestor con­fi­dence in Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic out­look and raised hopes that the pan­demic may soon be un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>Ex­ist­ing projects con­tin­ued to see sus­tained in­ter­est, PropNex head of re­search and content Wong Siew Ying said. “About 70 per cent (or 540 units) of Novem­ber’s sales were from projects al­ready on the mar­ket.”</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Riviere, at the former Zouk site, moved more units af­ter cut­ting its me­dian price to $2,541 per sq ft (psf), from $2,932 when it was launched in May last year. About 18 per cent have hith­erto been sold, noted Ms Tri­cia Song, head of re­search for Sin­ga­pore at Col­liers In­ter­na­tional.</p>
    <p>The mar­ket’s re­silience could well spill over into this month, an­a­lysts said. With pan­demic-led travel re­stric­tions up­set­ting most out­bound hol­i­day plans, De­cem­ber is likely to be any­thing but a lull pe­riod for home sales, said PropNex chief ex­ec­u­tive Is­mail Gafoor.</p>
    <p>“With two new projects out – Ki Res­i­dences and Clavon, which re­spec­tively sold 143 and 442 units at their launch – we ex­pect new home sales to cross the 1,000-unit mark this month,” he added.</p>
    <p>Small won­der that de­vel­op­ers are gear­ing up for more new launches in­stead of typ­i­cally wind­ing down for the year-end hol­i­days. A to­tal of 13 new projects are ex­pected to hit the mar­ket in the com­ing months and they in­clude Nor­man­ton Park, The Reef at King’s Dock and Mid­town Mod­ern.</p>
    <p>Two ECs – Parc Cen­tral Res­i­dences and Provence Res­i­dence – are ex­pected to launch, said ERA Realty’s head of re­search and con­sul­tancy Ni­cholas Mak.</p>
    <p>But Novem­ber’s sales are still down 34 per cent from the 1,165 units sold a year ago, even as the num­ber of new units launched last month jumped 45 per cent year on year to 1,375.</p>
    <p>De­spite last month’s re­bound, new home sales are still down 42.3 per cent from Septem­ber, show­ing the “sig­nif­i­cant im­pact of the clam­p­down on OTP reis­suances”, noted JLL se­nior di­rec­tor of re­search and con­sul­tancy Ong Teck Hui.</p>
    <p>The pro­por­tion of Hous­ing Board up­graders con­tin­ued to fall as only 46 per cent of to­tal sales last month were priced at the me­dian price of $1,000 psf to $2,000 psf, com­pared with 72 per cent in Oc­to­ber, Ms Song noted.</p>
    <p>More than 50 per cent of to­tal sales last month were priced at the me­dian price of $2,000 psf to $3,000 psf, as city fringe or rest of cen­tral re­gion projects dom­i­nated.</p>
    <p>Two such projects – the 120-unit The Linq @ Beauty World and the 396-unit The Land­mark – topped the best­sellers’ list last month. The Linq sold 118 units at a me­dian price of $2,171 psf, while The Land­mark moved 109 units at a me­dian price of $2,135 psf.</p>
    <p>Over 30 per cent of sales were in the sub­urbs or out­side the cen­tral re­gion and 11 per cent were in the prime or core cen­tral re­gion.</p>
