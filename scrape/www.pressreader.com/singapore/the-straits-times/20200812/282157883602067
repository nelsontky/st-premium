    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) • The phone rang on Sun­day night with a giddy Stephen Curry on the other end of the line.</p>
    <p>The most renowned l ong-dis­tance shooter in bas­ket­ball was driv­ing home from what he de­scribed as a true bucket-list ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Curry fol­lowed the l ast three groups at last week­end’s PGA Cham­pi­onship from the best van­tage point he could have imag­ined for such a pres­ti­gious event.</p>
    <p>“Right on the ropes,” he said. “You al­most for­got it was a Ma­jor be­cause it was so quiet out there.”</p>
    <p>Curry was among the se­lect few who had the juice to gain en­try to TPC Hard­ing Park in San Fran­cisco when it was closed to the public.</p>
    <p>It was not ter­ri­bly sur­pris­ing given that he has led the Golden State War­riors to three cham­pi­onships in the past five years, win­ning back-to-back National Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) Most Valu­able Player Awards.</p>
    <p>That the ex­pe­ri­ence was such a pinch-me sce­nario for him should also be un­der­stand­able by now; Curry openly loves golf as much as he rel­ishes un­cork­ing three-point­ers.</p>
    <p>Yet these are also strange times for the six-time All-Star. It was an es­cape from the con­stant re­minders that he and the War­riors are some­how ir­rel­e­vant in the NBA for now.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously, I was happy to see bas­ket­ball back on TV, but that first week I had ma­jor Fomo,” Curry said, us­ing the pop­u­lar term “fear of miss­ing out”.</p>
    <p>“Once you see ’Bron and Kawhi and PG (Paul Ge­orge) go at it, and you re­mem­ber how much fun it is to play in those types of games and that kind of level, you miss it badly,” he added, re­fer­ring to the July 30 show­down be­tween the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers and the Los An­ge­les Clip­pers – the day when the NBA re­sumed af­ter a four-month plus coro­n­avirus-en­forced break.</p>
    <p>The War­riors were one of eight teams – chris­tened the “Delete Eight” – who were not in­vited to par­tic­i­pate in the restart here at Dis­ney World.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Curry broke his left hand in Oc­to­ber, Golden State went 15-50 this reg­u­lar season and, truth­fully, did not war­rant an in­vi­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>The team was al­ready brac­ing for a tough year with­out Klay Thomp­son, who tore his an­te­rior cru­ci­ate lig­a­ment dur­ing last year’s Fi­nals.</p>
    <p>But War­rior of­fi­cials be­lieve the longer-than-usual rest that Curry, Thomp­son and Dray­mond Green are get­ting will help vault them back to their usual stand­ing among the elite next season.</p>
    <p>Their con­sec­u­tive Fi­nals ap­pear­ances from 2015-19 amounted to a grind unseen since the reign of the 1960s Bos­ton Celtics.</p>
    <p>It is bizarre to see players and staff mem­bers from 22 teams mov­ing through­out the sprawl­ing NBA cam­pus at Dis­ney World – and to never see any­one in War­riors gear.</p>
    <p>The fran­chise that lorded over the league for the bet­ter part of a decade has zero pres­ence in the “bub­ble”.</p>
    <p>The strug­gle to process that di­chotomy hits Curry ev­ery time he vis­its the War­riors’ prac­tice fa­cil­ity for a week­day work­out.</p>
    <p>Only four players are al­lowed in the gym at any time, for pre­cau­tion­ary health rea­sons but games from the bub­ble are al­ways on the near­est tele­vi­sion screen, even if he is get­ting work done in the morn­ing.</p>
    <p>“It’s just weird,” the 32-year-old point guard said. Yet he is con­vinced that the War­riors have a big re­bound in store, even though he and his All-Star team­mates – Thomp­son and Green are 30 – are not get­ting any younger.</p>
    <p>He is adamant that Golden State – with the for­mer No. 1 over­all pick An­drew Wiggins on their ros­ter and a top-five draft pick to keep or trade this year – are the one team who would surely ben­e­fit from go­ing nine months, or po­ten­tially longer, with­out play­ing a mean­ing­ful game.</p>
    <p>“Our ros­ter kind of speaks for it­self in terms of what me, Klay and Dray­mond have been through, and what we’ve got left in the tank,” he said. “But it’s on us to use this time wisely. It’s just un­charted ter­ri­tory, whether you’re in the bub­ble or not.”</p>
    <p>To cope with the Fomo, Curry re­vealed that he re­lies on all the bonus fam­ily time he is get­ting with his wife, Ayesha, and their three chil­dren, business en­deav­ours and then spe­cial oc­ca­sions like Sun­day’s PGA out­ing.</p>
    <p>Since it re­mains un­clear when next season will start, he is set­tling into “pure fan­dom”. He noted: “I think it’s a pretty good space to be in af­ter what we’ve been through the last five years.”</p>
