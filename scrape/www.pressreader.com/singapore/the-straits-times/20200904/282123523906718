    <p>Re­cently, I bought a car­ton of milk from a FairPrice Finest out­let. When I re­turned home, I was dis­mayed to find that the milk had al­ready gone off, even with an ex­piry date of two weeks later.</p>
    <p>I walked to a nearby FairPrice store to ask for a re­fund, as the out­let I had bought the milk from was much far­ther away from my home.</p>
    <p>At my reg­u­lar FairPrice store, I waited 20 min­utes be­fore I was at­tended to, only to be told that I had to re­turn the milk to the orig­i­nal FairPrice out­let I had bought it from.</p>
    <p>I made the one-hour jour­ney back to the orig­i­nal out­let and queued at the reg­u­lar check-out counter to make my in­quiry.</p>
    <p>When it was my turn to be served, the cashier took 20 min­utes to track down the su­per­vi­sor, who was the only one au­tho­rised to give me a re­fund. I stood there awk­wardly while a long queue formed be­hind me.</p>
    <p>I am a heav­ily preg­nant woman, and this ex­pe­ri­ence re­ally brought home the dif­fi­culty con­sumers face in re­turn­ing or ex­chang­ing goods in Sin­ga­pore when the prod­uct is faulty or de­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>I had ex­pected that since FairPrice is ubiq­ui­tous around the coun­try, and su­per­mar­ket gro­cery shop­ping is es­sen­tial to all in the com­mu­nity, it would be sim­pler to get a re­fund on a faulty item – 10 min­utes per­haps, rather than four hours of my day.</p>
    <p>I hope FairPrice changes its poli­cies so that vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple, like preg­nant women and the el­derly, in par­tic­u­lar, are spared the in­con­ve­nience, time loss and phys­i­cal toil in get­ting a sim­ple re­fund for a faulty prod­uct.</p>
    <p>This prob­lem could per­haps be solved if FairPrice sim­ply al­lowed re­turns at any of its branches, and also im­ple­mented sep­a­rate coun­ters for cus­tomer ser­vice in­quiries, re­funds and ex­changes.</p>
