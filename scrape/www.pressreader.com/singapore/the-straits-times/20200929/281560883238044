    <p>PayNow users will now be able to send a higher amount of money to oth­ers on the ser­vice. All of the nine par­tic­i­pat­ing PayNow banks will al­low ad hoc trans­ac­tions of up to at least $5,000. PayNow users were pre­vi­ously able to make daily trans­ac­tions of up to $1,000 in to­tal with­out adding the re­cip­i­ent as a payee.</p>
    <p>SUG­GESTED IM­PROVE­MENT</p>
    <p>PayNow users will now be able to send a larger amount of money to oth­ers on the funds trans­fer ser­vice.</p>
    <p>All nine par­tic­i­pat­ing PayNow banks will al­low ad hoc trans­ac­tions of at least $5,000, said the As­so­ci­a­tion of Banks in Sin­ga­pore (ABS) yes­ter­day. PayNow users were pre­vi­ously able to make daily trans­ac­tions of up to $1,000 in to­tal with­out adding the re­cip­i­ent as a payee.</p>
    <p>ABS said the move to raise the limit will al­low cus­tomers to use PayNow for a wider scope of pay­ments to mer­chants and friends.</p>
    <p>The higher limit ap­plies to PayNow on both In­ter­net bank­ing and mo­bile ap­pli­ca­tion chan­nels.</p>
    <p>It in­cludes scan-and-pay trans­ac­tions and trans­fers ini­ti­ated by en­ter­ing the NRIC num­ber, mo­bile num­ber or Unique En­tity Num­ber of the re­cip­i­ent, with­out first go­ing through the process of adding the re­cip­i­ent as a payee.</p>
    <p>The nine par­tic­i­pat­ing banks are Bank of China (BOC), Citibank, DBS Bank, HSBC, In­dus­trial and Com­mer­cial Bank of China (ICBC), May­bank, OCBC Bank, Stan­dard Char­tered Bank and United Over­seas Bank.</p>
    <p>The trans­ac­tion limit for re­tail cus­tomers has been raised to $5,000 for BOC and ICBC; $10,000 for Citibank and StanChart (with scan-and-pay trans­ac­tions of up to $50,000 for StanChart); and $200,000 for UOB, DBS, HSBC, May­bank and OCBC.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers will be re­quired to key in their two-fac­tor au­then­ti­ca­tion num­ber for trans­ac­tions above $1,000. They may also set their PayNow limit to a level that they are com­fort­able with, said ABS.</p>
    <p>The as­so­ci­a­tion said it will con­tinue to work with the in­dus­try to pro­mote PayNow as a con­ve­nient and se­cure way to trans­fer funds.</p>
    <p>As of Au­gust, more than 4.46 mil­lion reg­is­tered PayNow users had col­lec­tively trans­ferred nearly $34 bil­lion since the launch of the ser­vice in June 2017.</p>
    <p>Ms An­drea Lim, 23, who works in busi­ness devel­op­ment, said the in­creased limit will make it eas­ier for her to make large pay­ments such as for elec­tronic items. “Not hav­ing to use to­kens makes the pay­ment process a lot more con­ve­nient.”</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Duan Jin-Chuan from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness School said the higher limit af­fects spon­ta­neous trans­ac­tions in higher amounts.</p>
    <p>While PayNow is con­ve­nient, it re­quires users to be linked to a bank ac­count, he added. “If PayNow adds a wal­let func­tion that can hold a cash bal­ance with­out link­ing to any bank ac­count, it will have po­ten­tial to be­come a uni­fied funds trans­fer sys­tem.”</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Aurobindo Ghosh from the Lee Kong Chian School of Busi­ness at Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity said the in­creased limit will make it eas­ier for cash-strapped small and medi­um­sized en­ter­prises to use PayNow to re­ceive pay­ments for goods.</p>
    <p>“This might re­duce the work­ing cap­i­tal cy­cle or con­ver­sion of in­ven­tory to cash, crit­i­cal for net work­ing cap­i­tal man­age­ment and ul­ti­mately, in some cases, sur­vival of some of these en­ter­prises,” he said.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Angie Low from Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s Nanyang Busi­ness School said the higher PayNow limit might change the ser­vice’s land­scape. “This will likely at­tract more users with dif­fer­ing pur­poses and where trans­ac­tion val­ues ex­ceed $1,000.”</p>
    <p>ABS’ lat­est an­nounce­ment comes amid re­cent de­vel­op­ments on the use of the funds trans­fer ser­vice. Last Wed­nes­day, the In­fo­comm Me­dia Devel­op­ment Au­thor­ity said PayNow Cor­po­rate, an in­stant funds trans­fer ser­vice for busi­nesses, will be in­te­grated into Sin­ga­pore’s na­tion­wide e-in­voic­ing net­work.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­ity worked with DBS, OCBC and UOB to de­velop the solution, which aims to al­low busi­nesses to bill and make pay­ments to one an­other seam­lessly on­line.</p>
    <p>The next day, it was an­nounced that DBS PayLah and StanChart cus­tomers can now use Google Pay to trans­fer funds di­rectly from their bank ac­counts to any­one reg­is­tered with PayNow.</p>
    <p>If PayNow adds a wal­let func­tion that can hold a cash bal­ance with­out link­ing to any bank ac­count, it will have po­ten­tial to be­come a uni­fied funds trans­fer sys­tem.</p>
    <p>PRO­FES­SOR DUAN JIN-CHUAN, from the NUS Busi­ness School, on mak­ing PayNow even more con­ve­nient.</p>
