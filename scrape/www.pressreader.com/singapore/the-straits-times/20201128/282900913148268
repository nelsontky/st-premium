    <p>Elec­tron­ics and fur­ni­ture re­tailer Courts was ac­quired by Ja­panese con­sumer elec­tron­ics gi­ant No­jima Cor­po­ra­tion last year.</p>
    <p>And now, Courts Sin­ga­pore is re­train­ing its staff in a bid to build long-term re­la­tion­ships with shop­pers rather than fo­cus purely on ring­ing up the tills.</p>
    <p>To do this, it is em­brac­ing what its chief ex­ec­u­tive Matthew Hoang de­scribes as No­jima’s “time­honoured Ja­panese prin­ci­ples”.</p>
    <p>Mr Hoang be­lieves in equip­ping sales staff with more soft skills.</p>
    <p>“Mak­ing a sale is not the most im­por­tant thing in a con­sumer elec­tron­ics store,” says the 36-year-old, who was ap­pointed group chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer of Courts Asia and coun­try chief ex­ec­u­tive of Courts Sin­ga­pore in Au­gust last year.</p>
    <p>“Us­ing time-hon­oured Ja­panese prin­ci­ples, staff build trust with shop­pers through ca­sual chat­ting and ad­vis­ing on the best so­lu­tions based on ex­cel­lent prod­uct knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>“This en­cour­ages shop­pers to come back be­cause they feel com­fort­able at our stores, whether they de­cide to make a pur­chase or not.”</p>
    <p>He notes that No­jima’s Ja­panese man­age­ment style en­com­passes re­spect for all em­ploy­ees and sup­port for those who em­brace chal­lenges re­gard­less of dif­fi­cul­ties.</p>
    <p>Courts Asia, which has its roots as a Bri­tish fur­ni­ture re­tailer, opened in Sin­ga­pore in 1974.</p>
    <p>It opened a store in Malaysia in 1987 and en­tered the In­done­sian mar­ket in 2014.</p>
    <p>To­day, it has 70 stores across the three South-east Asian mar­kets, span­ning over 1.1 mil­lion sq ft of re­tail space. It adopts om­nichan­nel re­tail­ing, of­fer­ing elec­tri­cal and IT prod­ucts as well as fur­ni­ture and home decor ac­ces­sories.</p>
    <p>Mr Hoang, who is Viet­namese and is also flu­ent in Ja­panese, started in the re­tail in­dus­try as a sales as­sis­tant for No­jima in Ja­pan. He rose up the ranks and was tasked to set up No­jima’s oper­a­tions in Viet­nam and Cam­bo­dia be­fore helm­ing Courts Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>He says: “No­jima and Courts pro­vide an en­vi­ron­ment that gives our staff the chance to take own­er­ship of their ca­reers. Open­ness, fair­ness, cre­ativ­ity and in­no­va­tion are some of the qual­i­ties we nur­ture in our em­ploy­ees at Courts.”</p>
    <p>One of the new pro­grammes ini­ti­ated at Courts is the grad­u­ate as­so­ci­ate train­ing pro­gramme, which helps new hires tran­si­tion from be­ing fresh out of school to en­ter­ing a pro­fes­sional re­tail en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>It in­volves close in­ter­ac­tions with man­age­ment men­tors that iden­tify staff’s in­ter­ests and strengths, which al­low them to later as­sume roles based on their as­sets.</p>
    <p>One em­ployee who ben­e­fited from the pro­gramme, Mr Luong Huu Loc, 23, says he was given the op­por­tu­nity to ex­pe­ri­ence the con­sult­ing sales tech­nique – de­vel­oped by No­jima to guide cus­tomers through their pur­chase jour­ney by ask­ing con­sul­ta­tive ques­tions and gain­ing a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of their life­style and needs.</p>
    <p>“The cru­cial part of the pro­gramme is be­ing ex­posed to the re­tail front lines,” says Mr Luong, who joined Courts on Oct 1 last year as a grad­u­ate as­so­ci­ate with</p>
    <p>Courts Me­ga­s­tore in Tampines and is to­day an IT depart­ment man­ager at Courts Seran­goon Nex Store.</p>
    <p>He adds: “Com­mu­ni­cat­ing with cus­tomers is an art which re­quires strong prod­uct knowl­edge, an un­der­stand­ing of cus­tomer needs and de­mo­graph­ics.”</p>
    <p>An­other grad­u­ate as­so­ci­ate, Mr Chew Jing Soon, 25, says the con­sult­ing sales tech­nique has sharp­ened his sell­ing and cus­tomer ser­vice skills.</p>
    <p>“The train­ing helped me gain con­fi­dence to build and share my prod­uct knowl­edge with cus­tomers,” he says. “There was strong sup­port and coach­ing from man­agers and train­ers as well.</p>
    <p>“Grad­u­ate associates have the op­por­tu­nity to ro­tate among dif­fer­ent de­part­ments and be ex­posed to dif­fer­ent types of skills and spe­cialised know-how.”</p>
