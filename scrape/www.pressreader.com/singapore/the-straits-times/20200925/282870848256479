    <p>• Tommy DeVito, an orig­i­nal mem­ber of the Four Sea­sons, the close-har­mony quar­tet that rock­eted to fame in the early 1960s, died on Mon­day in Ne­vada, United States. He was 92.</p>
    <p>Four Sea­sons earned new gen­er­a­tions of fans when the Broad­way mu­si­cal Jersey Boys told a semi- fac­tual ver­sion of the group’s story.</p>
    <p>Frankie Valli and Bob Gau­dio, the two sur­viv­ing orig­i­nal mem­bers of the group, an­nounced DeVito’s death. A spokesman for Valli said the cause was the coronaviru­s.</p>
    <p>DeVito had moved to Las Ve­gas in Ne­vada decades ago af­ter leav­ing the Four Sea­sons in 1970. Grow­ing up in dif­fi­cult cir­cum­stances in his na­tive New Jersey, he was, in his own words, “a hell-raiser” as a youth, but he found pur­pose in mu­sic.</p>
    <p>He formed a band called the Va­ri­ety Trio with one of his broth­ers and Nick Massi, who would be­come the fourth mem­ber of the Four Sea­sons when that group co­a­lesced in about 1960. Massi died in 2000 at 73.</p>
    <p>The group’s key com­po­nent was Valli, with his falsetto vo­cals. In a 2008 in­ter­view with mu­sic pub­li­ca­tion Gold­mine, DeVito re­called that his trio had per­formed reg­u­larly at a bar in New Jersey, when Valli, a teenager six years younger than him, would sneak in to watch them play.</p>
    <p>The band mem­bers knew Valli from the neigh­bour­hood and that he had pipes.</p>
    <p>“I’d call him up to the stage and let him sing,” DeVito said. “He’d get off right away, be­cause he wasn’t re­ally sup­posed to be in there; he was un­der­age.”</p>
    <p>Be­fore long, Valli was part of the group, which went through name and line-up changes be­fore be­com­ing the Four Sea­sons. Sherry, the group’s break­out hit, topped the charts in 1962. A string of hits fol­lowed, in­clud­ing Walk Like A Man (1963) and Rag Doll (1964).</p>
    <p>DeVito did not en­tirely shed his “hell-raiser” past; he ran up debts and caused ten­sions within the group. In 1970 he was forced out, as some ac­counts said, or left be­cause the pres­sures of tour­ing had dis­agreed with him, as he said.</p>
    <p>He quickly burnt through his money from the group’s hey­day, and worked in casi­nos and clean­ing houses to get by.</p>
    <p>DeVito had some suc­cess as a record pro­ducer and recorded an al­bum of Ital­ian folk songs.</p>
    <p>See­ing a ver­sion of him­self por­trayed in Jersey Boys was star­tling, he said. But he was com­fort­able with the show, which he de­scried as “about 85 per cent true to life”.</p>
    <p>Jersey Boys opened on Broad­way in Novem­ber 2005 and ran un­til Jan­uary 2017, one of the long­est runs in Broad­way his­tory.</p>
    <p>It won four Tony Awards, in­clud­ing Best Mu­si­cal and Best Fea­tured Ac­tor for Chris­tian Hoff, who played DeVito. Clint East­wood di­rected a film ver­sion in 2014.</p>
