    <p>Ac­cel­er­at­ing its re­search and de­vel­op­ment, mov­ing into emerg­ing mar­kets and switch­ing to lower-end elec­tron­ics could help Huawei sus­tain its con­sumer busi­ness in the midst of the United States-China tech war.</p>
    <p>The be­lea­guered Chi­nese tech gi­ant – seen as a na­tional se­cu­rity threat by the US – has been barred from trad­ing with US firms since May last year.</p>
    <p>The US gov­ern­ment added new re­stric­tions last month to pre­vent Huawei from sourc­ing chips – used in ev­ery­thing from smart­phones to wear­ables – from non-US chip­mak­ers that use US tech­nol­ogy to make their prod­ucts, such as Sam­sung and Me­di­aTek.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts say the new sanc­tions are a mas­sive blow to Huawei’s smart­phone busi­ness, though the Chi­nese firm has re­port­edly stock­piled suf­fi­cient chips to last till the middle of next year.</p>
    <p>Mr Jin Sheng­tao, an an­a­lyst at mar­ket tracker Canalys, told The Straits Times that in­stead of mak­ing phones, Huawei could em­u­late firms like Qual­comm, which de­signs chips as a busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“Huawei still has a huge pool of patents and some of the best re­searchers in China, so there is the pos­si­bil­ity to trans­form into a patent com­pany,” he says.</p>
    <p>Ms Rachel He, se­nior an­a­lyst at mar­ket re­search firm Euromon­i­tor In­ter­na­tional, says Huawei has been di­ver­si­fy­ing into other prod­uct cat­e­gories, such as lap­tops and wear­ables, to be less re­liant on smart­phone sales.</p>
    <p>She sug­gests that Huawei move more ag­gres­sively into mar­kets such as Africa and Rus­sia, where the US in­flu­ence is not as strong.</p>
    <p>Mr Boris Me­todiev, as­so­ci­ate di­rec­tor at mar­ket in­tel­li­gence firm Strat­egy An­a­lyt­ics, says when Huawei ex­hausts its sup­ply of chips, it could switch to mak­ing lower-end de­vices, such as fea­ture phones and fit­ness track­ers, that are not as de­pen­dent on re­stricted com­po­nents.</p>
    <p>But even as Huawei grap­ples with the new re­stric­tions – a spokesman told The Straits Times the firm is “still eval­u­at­ing the long-term im­pact of the re­stric­tions and ac­tively seek­ing so­lu­tions to min­imise their im­pact” – it showed the world last week the progress of its own mo­bile ecosys­tem.</p>
    <p>At its an­nual de­vel­oper con­fer­ence in Dongguan last Thurs­day, Huawei an­nounced that it will re­place Google’s widely used An­droid mo­bile op­er­at­ing sys­tem (OS) with its own Har­monyOS in its smart­phones from next year.</p>
    <p>In his key­note speech, Mr Richard Yu, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Huawei’s con­sumer busi­ness group, re­vealed plans to make Har­monyOS an open-source soft­ware.</p>
    <p>“Huawei will fully open core tech­nolo­gies as well as soft­ware and hard­ware ca­pa­bil­i­ties to de­vel­op­ers, col­lab­o­rat­ing with them to drive fur­ther in­no­va­tion of an all-sce­nario smart ecosys­tem,” he said.</p>
    <p>Har­monyOS, which de­buted on Huawei’s smart TVs last year, is de­signed for a broad range of smart de­vices.</p>
    <p>The just-an­nounced ver­sion 2.0 is avail­able for use in au­to­mo­biles, wear­ables and smart home ap­pli­ances, with a smart­phone ver­sion due in De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the Har­monyOS an­nounce­ments, Huawei also shared up­dates about other parts of its soft­ware ecosys­tem, such as the Ap­pGallery app store, EMUI user in­ter­face and Huawei Mo­bile Ser­vices, which in­clude tools to build and manage apps. The Chi­nese firm also launched six new prod­ucts in the au­dio, notebook and wear­able cat­e­gories.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Huawei, its mo­bile ecosys­tem is now the third largest in the world, be­hind Ap­ple’s iOS and Google’s An­droid, with more than 1.8 mil­lion de­vel­op­ers – a fig­ure that has dou­bled since last year’s de­vel­oper con­fer­ence – and 490 mil­lion monthly ac­tive users glob­ally. Its app store has about 96,000 apps, up from 60,000 in March, though Ap­ple and Google’s app stores have mil­lions of apps.</p>
    <p>The lack of apps, es­pe­cially the ones from Google, is cited by an­a­lysts as the rea­son Har­monyOS may find lit­tle trac­tion out­side China.</p>
    <p>Mr Me­todiev of Strat­egy An­a­lyt­ics says: “Hav­ing an op­er­at­ing sys­tem doesn’t mean hav­ing a vi­able plat­form. Har­monyOS can be an al­ter­na­tive to An­droid only in China or other coun­tries where Google is banned.”</p>
    <p>When asked how Huawei in­tends to at­tract users out­side China to its ecosys­tem, its spokesman said: “We are con­tin­u­ously work­ing with de­vel­op­ers around the world to de­liver a bet­ter mo­bile ex­pe­ri­ence for all.</p>
    <p>“We also be­lieve our in­no­va­tive prod­ucts and tech­nolo­gies will ad­dress cus­tomer needs and pro­vide a bet­ter dig­i­tal ex­pe­ri­ence that will con­tinue to re­main com­pet­i­tive in the mar­ket.”</p>
    <p>SUB­STAN­TIAL PROGRESS IN CHINA</p>
    <p>Mr Charlie Dai, principal an­a­lyst at For­rester Re­search, says Huawei has made sub­stan­tial progress in the past year at cre­at­ing a vi­able mo­bile ecosys­tem, es­pe­cially in China.</p>
    <p>He adds: “Con­sumer be­hav­iour in over­seas mar­kets can­not be eas­ily changed. How­ever, cus­tomer ex­pe­ri­ence mat­ters the most and the Chi­nese mar­ket is big enough for Huawei to stay alive by con­tin­u­ously strength­en­ing its prod­ucts and grow­ing its ecosys­tems.”</p>
    <p>Fo­cus­ing on the Chi­nese smart­phone mar­ket, which has re­cov­ered from the pan­demic ear­lier than most coun­tries, was the rea­son for Huawei’s re­mark­able ship­ment per­for­mance in the sec­ond quar­ter of the year, when it over­took Sam­sung to be­come the world’s largest smart­phone maker with about 55 mil­lion phones shipped, ac­cord­ing to mar­ket in­tel­li­gence firm Coun­ter­point Re­search.</p>
    <p>At the same time, Huawei’s smart­phone ship­ments out­side China de­clined by 29 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter, com­pared with a year ago, says Coun­ter­point Re­search.</p>
    <p>Euromon­i­tor’s Ms He says it is dif­fi­cult to as­sess Har­monyOS’ al­lure to de­vel­op­ers out­side China be­cause of the un­cer­tainty over fu­ture Huawei smart­phones.</p>
    <p>Al­though Huawei has made much progress on the soft­ware ecosys­tem front, it has lim­ited op­tions when it comes to se­cur­ing its sup­ply of chips.</p>
    <p>China’s semi­con­duc­tor in­dus­try lacks the ex­per­tise to build the high-end chips re­quired by Huawei, de­spite the cre­ation of a US$29 bil­lion (S$39 bil­lion) state-backed fund last year to boost the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“It will take years for China to be­come tech­no­log­i­cally in­de­pen­dent of Amer­i­can tech­nol­ogy,” says Canalys’ Mr Jin.</p>
    <p>The US’ hard­line stance against Huawei is also un­likely to soften re­gard­less of the result of Novem­ber’s US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, say an­a­lysts.</p>
    <p>Mr Jeff Field­hack, re­search di­rec­tor at Coun­ter­point Re­search, says: “The only thing Democrats and Repub­li­cans agree on is be­ing tough on China. It will not be Joe Bi­den’s first pri­or­ity if he is elected, so this trade ban may last a while.”</p>
    <p>He adds that the US will want an eco­nomic trade deal with China even­tu­ally and that Huawei will be “part of the ne­go­ti­a­tion”.</p>
