    <p>Al­lied ed­u­ca­tors who help stu­dents with learn­ing dif­fi­cul­ties will have more av­enues for ca­reer growth in the com­ing years. In recog­ni­tion of their grow­ing im­por­tance, the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion said yes­ter­day that a greater num­ber of higher-level po­si­tions will be cre­ated for al­lied ed­u­ca­tors pro­vid­ing learn­ing and be­havioural sup­port.</p>
    <p>Al­lied ed­u­ca­tors (AEDs) who help stu­dents with learn­ing dif­fi­cul­ties will have more av­enues for ca­reer growth in the com­ing years.</p>
    <p>In recog­ni­tion of their grow­ing im­por­tance, the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) said yes­ter­day that a greater num­ber of higher-level po­si­tions will be cre­ated for al­lied ed­u­ca­tors pro­vid­ing learn­ing and be­havioural sup­port (LBS).</p>
    <p>These are non-teach­ing staff who work with stu­dents in main­stream schools who have mild spe­cial needs such as dys­lexia, autism and at­ten­tion deficit hy­per­ac­tiv­ity dis­or­der.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, the MOE said that al­lied ed­u­ca­tors pro­vid­ing learn­ing and be­havioural sup­port will have their own de­vel­op­ment track when the al­lied ed­u­ca­tor scheme is split into dis­tinct tracks in 2022.</p>
    <p>A spokesman said this will “al­low MOE to bet­ter recog­nise the unique pro­fes­sional ex­per­tise and di­ver­sity in spe­cial­i­sa­tion for each in­di­vid­ual AED staff group and build a sense of iden­tity within their own scheme track”.</p>
    <p>There are cur­rently about 2,000 al­lied ed­u­ca­tors, with 600 spe­cial­is­ing in learn­ing and be­havioural sup­port.</p>
    <p>Each pri­mary school here has two al­lied ed­u­ca­tors spe­cial­is­ing in learn­ing and be­havioural sup­port, and most sec­ondary schools have one such al­lied ed­u­ca­tor each.</p>
    <p>The to­tal num­ber of such staff has in­creased by more than 40 per cent over the last five years, to cater to the grow­ing be­havioural needs of stu­dents. Other kinds of al­lied ed­u­ca­tors in­clude school coun­sel­lors, out­door ad­ven­ture ed­u­ca­tors and stu­dent wel­fare of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>MOE is also cre­at­ing more higher-level jobs based in its head­quar­ters in the years ahead, start­ing from Jan­uary next year with two new lead al­lied ed­u­ca­tors spe­cial­is­ing i n learn­ing and be­havioural sup­port.</p>
    <p>There will also be more po­si­tions like mas­ter and prin­ci­pal AEDs (LBS) for staff to aim for, where they can de­velop do­main ex­per­tise and strengthen pro­fes­sional lead­er­ship in spe­cial needs sup­port.</p>
    <p>In the long term, the fra­ter­nity will be l ed by sev­eral prin­ci­pal AEDs (LBS) with ex­per­tise across dif­fer­ent ar­eas, such as the needs of younger stu­dents or ado­les­cents, or spe­cific needs such as at­ten­tion deficit hy­per­ac­tiv­ity dis­or­der.</p>
    <p>Al­lied ed­u­ca­tors spe­cial­is­ing in learn­ing and be­havioural sup­port will also have more op­por­tu­ni­ties for ro­ta­tion stints at the MOE head­quar­ters. Fi­nan­cial sup­port will be pro­vided to al­lied ed­u­ca­tors who wish to pur­sue rel­e­vant pro­grammes to deepen their knowl­edge and skills.</p>
    <p>Ms Maria Lourdes and Mr Muham­mad Suhairi Subarjo are the first two ed­u­ca­tors to be ap­pointed as lead AEDs (LBS). This will take ef­fect next Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Ms Lourdes is cur­rently a se­nior AED (LBS) based in MOE’s spe­cial ed­u­ca­tional needs di­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>Said the 40-year-old, who started as an AED (LBS) in Jurongvill­e Sec­ondary School and was there from 2008 to 2017: “We want to do more in the com­ing years, like fo­cus­ing more on older stu­dents and pre­par­ing them for jobs, as well as men­tor and coach AEDs.</p>
    <p>“In the past, kids usu­ally come in with­out much sup­port, but now they have some knowl­edge of ba­sic in­ter­ven­tion, so we fo­cus on so­cial skills needed as teenagers.”</p>
    <p>She added that stu­dents with be­havioural needs also need sup­port in so­cial me­dia use.</p>
    <p>Mr Suhairi, 40, who is also a se­nior AED (LBS) in the MOE spe­cial ed­u­ca­tional needs di­vi­sion, said hav­ing more op­por­tu­ni­ties for growth will also help to re­tain ed­u­ca­tors in the long run.</p>
    <p>He was an AED (LBS) in Tampines Sec­ondary School from 2005 to</p>
    <p>NOT AN IN­STANT PROCESS</p>
    <p>It takes time to mod­ify be­hav­iour, and that’s one chal­lenge we face with par­ents and teach­ers who ex­pect the prob­lem to be quickly over­come with just two or three in­ter­ven­tion ses­sions.’’</p>
    <p>MR MUHAM­MAD SUHAIRI SUBARJO, on how guid­ing stu­dents with be­havioural or learn­ing is­sues takes time.</p>
    <p>PA­TIENCE NEEDED</p>
    <p>We try to un­der­stand where they’re com­ing from, and get them to see that with the right in­ter­ven­tion, their child can ex­cel aca­dem­i­cally or so­cially. Par­ents some­times can­not see the long-term goals be­cause they only see the cur­rent is­sues, so we have to be very pa­tient.’’</p>
    <p>MS MARIA LOURDES, who says some par­ents may take a few years to ac­cept that their child has spe­cial needs.</p>
    <p>2017, be­fore mov­ing to the min­istry head­quar­ters at the end of 2017.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Suhairi: “Hav­ing ro­ta­tions and see­ing other schools will be help­ful. Some­times be­ing in one school for so long, your per­spec­tives might be bi­ased.</p>
    <p>“There are more things to learn when you move around.”</p>
