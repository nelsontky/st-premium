    <p>NEW DELHI • In­dia’s drug reg­u­la­tor yes­ter­day gave fi­nal ap­proval for the emer­gency use of two coro­n­avirus vac­cines, one de­vel­oped by As­traZeneca and Ox­ford Univer­sity, and the other by lo­cal com­pany Bharat Biotech and a state-run in­sti­tute, paving the way for one of the world’s big­gest in­oc­u­la­tion drives.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sions mark the first vaccine ap­provals for the world’s sec­ond-most pop­u­lous coun­try, which, af­ter the United States, has recorded the most in­fec­tions of the coro­n­avirus dis­ease.</p>
    <p>It is now ex­pected to start a mas­sive im­mu­ni­sa­tion pro­gramme within about a week, a gov­ern­ment of­fi­cial said, and hopes to in­oc­u­late 300 mil­lion of its 1.35 bil­lion peo­ple free of charge in the first six to eight months of this year.</p>
    <p>The As­traZeneca-Ox­ford shot, al­ready ap­proved in Bri­tain, Ar­gentina and El Sal­vador, will take the lead and Bharat Biotech’s Co­vaxin will be ad­min­is­tered un­der stricter con­di­tions, given no ef­fi­cacy data has been re­leased for it.</p>
    <p>“It’s now time to reap the ben­e­fits of the ro­bust sup­ply chain in­fra­struc­ture we’ve put in place for quick and eq­ui­table dis­tri­bu­tion of the vaccine,” said Dr Harsh Vard­han, Health Min­is­ter of the coun­try, which is the world’s big­gest vaccine pro­ducer and ex­porter.</p>
    <p>He urged res­i­dents to trust the strin­gent pro­to­cols fol­lowed for en­sur­ing safety, ef­fi­cacy and im­muno­genic­ity of the ap­proved vac­cines.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has al­ready held na­tion­wide drills in the coun­try ahead of the mass vac­ci­na­tion drive and some 96,000 health work­ers have been trained to ad­min­is­ter the shots.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) wel­comed the news.</p>
    <p>“The use of vaccine(s) in pri­ori­tised pop­u­la­tions, along with con­tin­ued im­ple­men­ta­tion of other pub­lic health mea­sures and com­mu­nity par­tic­i­pa­tion, will be im­por­tant in re­duc­ing the im­pact of Covid-19,” WHO re­gional direc­tor Poonam Khetra­pal Singh said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Dr V.G. So­mani, drugs con­troller-gen­eral of In­dia, said the over­all ef­fi­cacy of the As­traZeneca-Ox­ford vaccine was 70.42 per cent, while Bharat Biotech’s Co­vaxin was “safe and pro­vides a ro­bust im­mune re­sponse”.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish-de­vel­oped As­traZeneca-Ox­ford shot is be­ing made lo­cally by the Serum In­sti­tute of In­dia (SII)and will be branded Co­vishield, while Bharat Biotech has teamed up with the gov­ern­men­trun In­dian Coun­cil of Med­i­cal Re­search.</p>
    <p>Both vac­cines “are be­ing ap­proved for re­stricted use in emer­gency sit­u­a­tions”, Dr So­mani, head of the Cen­tral Drugs Stan­dards Con­trol Or­gan­i­sa­tion, said at a news con­fer­ence, read­ing from a writ­ten state­ment. They will be ad­min­is­tered in two doses and stored at 2 deg C to 8 deg C, he said, without clar­i­fy­ing what in­ter­vals be­tween shots were be­ing rec­om­mended.</p>
    <p>Sources said on Satur­day that the doses would have to be given four weeks apart.</p>
    <p>Dr So­mani said the Bharat Biotech vaccine had been ap­proved “in pub­lic in­ter­est as an abun­dant pre­cau­tion, in clin­i­cal trial mode, to have more op­tions for vac­ci­na­tions, es­pe­cially in case of in­fec­tion by mu­tant strains”.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi wel­comed the ap­provals. “It would make ev­ery In­dian proud that the two vac­cines that have been given emer­gency use ap­proval are made in In­dia!” he said on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>SII, the world’s big­gest vaccine pro­ducer, has al­ready stock­piled more than 50 mil­lion doses of the As­traZeneca-Ox­ford vaccine even be­fore se­cur­ing a for­mal sup­ply deal with the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>But the Bri­tish shot has been plagued by un­cer­tainty over its most ef­fec­tive dosage ever since data pub­lished last Novem­ber showed a half dose fol­lowed by a full dose had a 90 per cent suc­cess rate, while two full shots were 62 per cent ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>The ef­fi­cacy of the In­dian vaccine could “go up much more” than 60 per cent af­ter two doses are given, a source with knowl­edge of the mat­ter told Reuters. Bharat Biotech ear­lier said it could pro­duce up to 300 mil­lion doses a year.</p>
    <p>In­dia has had more than 10.3 mil­lion Covid-19 cases and around 150,000 deaths, though its in­fec­tion rate has slowed sig­nif­i­cantly from a mid-Septem­ber peak.</p>
