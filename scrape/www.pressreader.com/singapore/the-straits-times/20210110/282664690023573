    <p>•</p>
    <p>English foot­ball min­nows Marine FC are pre­par­ing to host mighty Tot­ten­ham Hot­spur to­day in what will be the big­gest mis­match in FA Cup his­tory.</p>
    <p>Paul Leary, chair­man of the eighth-tier club, says he is the most ex­cited non-league chair­man in Eng­land ahead of the tie against the eight-time win­ners.</p>
    <p>There has never been such a wide dis­par­ity in league po­si­tions be­tween two teams in the third round of the com­pe­ti­tion, when the big teams en­ter the fray.</p>
    <p>Spurs are fourth in the Premier League, while Marine ply their trade in the North­ern Premier League North/West divi­sion.</p>
    <p>The club, lo­cated in Crosby on the north-west coast of Eng­land, near Liver­pool, bat­tled their way through seven rounds to reach this stage for just the sec­ond time since they were founded in 1894.</p>
    <p>Harry Kane and Son He­ung-min will face a team of part-timers in­clud­ing Danny Shaw, a phys­io­ther­a­pist who has been work­ing in a coron­avirus re­cov­ery ward.</p>
    <p>Jose Mour­inho’s men will have to pre­pare for the game in a func­tion room usu­ally used for wed­dings due to social distancing pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, for health rea­sons, Spurs chair­man Daniel Levy will be served a “five-star lunch box” in­stead of the tra­di­tional buf­fet.</p>
    <p>“There is no doubt it is the most spe­cial game in FA Cup his­tory,” Leary told AFP by phone from the 3,185-ca­pac­ity ground, which will be empty due to lock­down.</p>
    <p>“Marine, on step eight of the foot­ball sys­tem, play­ing Tot­ten­ham Hot­spur, one of the best sides in the Premier League. To wel</p>
    <p>come them is a mag­i­cal mo­ment.”</p>
    <p>De­spite los­ing out on match rev­enues of around £100,000 (S$179,000) be­cause of the ban on spec­ta­tors, Marine will re­ceive £75,000 from the BBC, who are show­ing it live on tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>Tot­ten­ham, used to play­ing in their gleam­ing £1 bil­lion Lon­don sta­dium, will have to quickly adapt to the more mod­est sur­round­ings.</p>
    <p>The side of the ground that fea­tures the dugouts where Mour­inho and his op­po­site num­ber Neil Young will sit, backs onto houses.</p>
    <p>“On the mesh fence there are the rel­e­vant house num­bers,” said Leary. “So if the ball goes over it the ball boy – or why not Harry Kane – can go around and knock on the door, in­tro­duce him­self and ask for the ball back.”</p>
    <p>If not Kane, Gareth Bale can do the job too, with Mour­inho con­firm­ing the for­ward could feature to­day af­ter re­cov­er­ing from a calf in­jury.</p>
    <p>“Gareth would like to play, so, if to­mor­row the feel­ings are pos­i­tive, he will come,” the Spurs boss said.</p>
