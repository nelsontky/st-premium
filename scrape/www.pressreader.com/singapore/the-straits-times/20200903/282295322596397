    <p>Sin­ga­pore will have to build re­silience in its sup­ply chains and work­force to move be­yond the cur­rent cri­sis, said Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Ravi Menon yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In his key­note ad­dress at the Sin­ga­pore Mar­itime Lec­ture we­bi­nar, held by the Mar­itime and Port Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore, he said the Covid-19 pan­demic has shown the world the im­por­tance of re­silience.</p>
    <p>“Re­silience is not just about be­ing strong, it is not even about stay­ing on your feet all the time. Re­silience is about get­ting back up again even af­ter be­ing knocked down... and to keep mov­ing for­ward,” he said, not­ing that the sharp con­trac­tion in global trade vol­umes has im­pacted the mar­itime in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>He de­bunked the idea that on­shoring and re­treat from global value chains will re­sult in re­silient sup­ply chains. “With the bor­der re­stric­tions in the wake of Covid-19, there has in­deed been some on­shoring of sup­ply chains to se­cure es­sen­tial goods and ser­vices. But it is not prac­ti­cal for most ac­tiv­i­ties to be on­shored and it will be costly and in­ef­fi­cient to do so.”</p>
    <p>He said the more ro­bust sup­ply chains are usu­ally the more di­ver­si­fied ones, backed by mul­ti­ple sources of raw ma­te­ri­als, pro­duc­tion lo­ca­tions, ware­house hubs and dis­tri­bu­tion chan­nels.</p>
    <p>While an ex­ten­sive re­lo­ca­tion of pro­duc­tion from China in the near term is un­likely, the de­sire to mit­i­gate China con­cen­tra­tion risk will lead to some di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion of pro­duc­tion lo­ca­tions in Asia, and the pan­demic has added some im­pe­tus to this trend.</p>
    <p>“Even be­fore Covid-19, firms had started to adopt a ‘China plus one’ sourc­ing and pro­duc­tion strat­egy as wage costs rose in China and US-China trade ten­sions in­ten­si­fied,” Mr Menon said, not­ing that new pro­duc­tion lo­ca­tions and value chains have emerged in Viet­nam, Tai­wan and, to some ex­tent, Malaysia, in this China-plus-one push.</p>
    <p>“The wind is blow­ing to­wards Asia,” he said, cred­it­ing the rise of Asia’s mid­dle class as the big­ger force driv­ing sup­ply chain di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Mid­dle-class con­sump­tion patterns are boost­ing and re­shap­ing in­tra-Asian trade in goods and ser­vices. Sup­ply chains that used to fo­cus on Asian ex­ports to Europe and Amer­ica are in­creas­ingly di­ver­si­fy­ing to also meet fi­nal de­mand in Asian mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Mr Menon said this would mean more regional trade routes and the grow­ing im­por­tance of regional ports, and 12 of the top 15 con­tainer ports in the world last year were in Asia.</p>
    <p>In the wake of the pan­demic, there will be a re­bal­anc­ing from just-in-time to just-in-case op­er­a­tions, but main­tain­ing huge stock­piles will be ex­pen­sive.</p>
    <p>Flex­i­ble sup­ply chains that can ramp up or down or quickly switch to other routes or pro­duc­tion points will thus have the ad­van­tage. In­te­grated sup­ply chains, with more seam­less so­lu­tions and end-to-end con­nec­tiv­ity across on­line and off­line lo­gis­tics ac­tiv­i­ties, will give firms greater re­silience.</p>
    <p>Au­to­ma­tion and dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies present op­por­tu­ni­ties to im­prove ef­fi­ciency and pro­vide bet­ter ser­vice across lo­gis­tics, port op­er­a­tions and ship­ping, but for busi­ness con­ti­nu­ity, the mar­itime in­dus­try also needs to ex­plore end-to-end dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion that links cus­tomers and other stake­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>But firms need to un­der­stand how tech­nol­ogy will af­fect jobs and how to ad­dress skills, jobs and ca­reers in an in­te­grated man­ner.</p>
    <p>In the fi­nan­cial sec­tor, for in­stance, an MAS-com­mis­sioned study by Ernst & Young on the im­pact on jobs showed that some tasks will be au­to­mated and oth­ers sub­sti­tuted by data an­a­lyt­ics. “The re­main­ing tasks will con­verge into new job roles that re­quire more judg­ment and cus­tomi­sa­tion – both of which re­quire new skill sets,” Mr Menon said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s mar­itime in­dus­try can build a re­silient work­force by do­ing sim­i­lar gran­u­lar anal­y­sis, “to iden­tify chang­ing tasks and new skills in evolv­ing job roles, map out skill gaps across the in­dus­try, and plan ap­pro­pri­ate in­ter­ven­tions”, he added.</p>
    <p>GET­TING BACK UP AGAIN</p>
    <p>Re­silience is not just about be­ing strong, it is not even about stay­ing on your feet all the time. Re­silience is about get­ting back up again even af­ter be­ing knocked down... and to keep mov­ing for­ward.</p>
    <p>MR RAVI MENON, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of the Mon­e­tary Author­ity</p>
