    <p>So many stay­cays, so lit­tle time. What makes this ho­tel spe­cial?</p>
    <p>The Good­wood Park Ho­tel is a name syn­ony­mous with old-world class. Built in 1900 as the Teu­to­nia Club for the ex­pa­tri­ate Ger­man com­mu­nity here, it marked its 120th birthday this year.</p>
    <p>Nes­tled amid bustling Or­chard Road, the ho­tel com­pound spans 6ha.</p>
    <p>In its sto­ried his­tory, it has hosted leg­endary Rus­sian bal­le­rina Anna Pavlova and was the first ho­tel in Sin­ga­pore to have a swim­ming pool.</p>
    <p>For­merly owned by the Jewish Manasseh broth­ers, it was bought in 1968 by late banker and hote­lier Khoo Teck Puat, whose statue stands in the lobby.</p>
    <p>In 1989, its tower was gazetted a na­tional mon­u­ment.</p>
    <p>First im­pres­sions?</p>
    <p>Given how it started life, Good­wood Park re­tains the gen­teel air of a coun­try club. The rooms are lushly ap­pointed in cream and gold; the stair­case balustrade­s are sweep­ing; and pots of white or­chids adorn ta­bles be­fore or­nate mir­rors.</p>
    <p>I am given a one-bed­room suite in the Mayfair wing, over­look­ing one of the swim­ming pools. The 90 sq m suite strikes me as enor­mous – there is a sit­ting room and a sep­a­rate din­ing area.</p>
    <p>I am not sure what to do with all this space, so I wind up work­ing from a dif­fer­ent part of the suite ev­ery hour – just for va­ri­ety.</p>
    <p>Although the ho­tel is near busy Or­chard Road, my room is sur­pris­ingly quiet. At one point, a child starts scream­ing in the room next door. I move to the other end of my do­main. Prob­lem solved.</p>
    <p>On a tour through the ho­tel, I get a peek into some of the other rooms – from the charm­ing Her­itage Rooms, with their red cab­i­nets and vin­tage head­boards, to the Rose Marie Suite, which is big­ger than most Hous­ing Board flats.</p>
    <p>It boasts chan­de­liers, a sauna, a walk-in wardrobe, a ban­quet ta­ble that can seat 10 (not that you should be hav­ing 10 peo­ple over dur­ing a pan­demic) and a bal­cony on which you can pose above the Good­wood Park sign and re­gard the glit­ter­ing swathe of Or­chard.</p>
    <p>Did they deck the halls?</p>
    <p>I have a whole Christ­mas tree in my room. Given that Christ­mas trees are in short sup­ply this year, I con­sider this no small feat.</p>
    <p>Good­wood Park’s hol­i­day dec­o­ra­tions are el­e­gantly un­der­stated for the most part. Af­ter all, if you want glitz, there is all of Or­chard Road to stroll down.</p>
    <p>We sam­ple the fes­tive menu at in-house restau­rant Gor­don Grill ($130 a per­son for a five-course din­ner). It does not ex­actly scream “Fa la la la la”, but it is pleas­ant, hearty cook­ing – duck leg con­fit, scal­lops in lemon but­ter, a trio of soups in lit­tle cups and so on.</p>
    <p>Nearby, a waiter carves up a small moun­tain of meats – ham, salami, pas­trami and more – on re­quest.</p>
    <p>What else is there to do?</p>
    <p>Good­wood Park has two swim­ming pools. The Ba­li­nese-style Mayfair pool, sur­rounded by vinestrewn gaze­bos, is the pret­tier one.</p>
    <p>As with most ho­tels th­ese days, pool spa­ces are lim­ited and ad­vance book­ing is re­quired.</p>
    <p>There are pock­ets of her­itage to be found around the ho­tel – whether it is an ex­hi­bi­tion of ninth-cen­tury arte­facts from the Tang Ship­wreck un­cov­ered in 1998, or the gleam­ing 1906 Fiat Brevetti parked in the drive­way for vin­tage car fans to ad­mire.</p>
    <p>Ver­dict: Bliss or miss?</p>
    <p>I get the feel­ing that one does not go to Good­wood Park to be daz­zled by nov­elty, but rather for the re­li­able de­liv­ery of clas­sics.</p>
    <p>If you like your stay­cays steeped in his­tory, or just fancy a quiet Christ­mas curled up in a crea­mand-gold arm­chair next to your very own tree, this is the one for you.</p>
    <p>Hot tip: Ask for the off-menu crepe suzette af­ter din­ner at Gor­don Grill. It is tasty and high on en­ter­tain­ment value.</p>
    <p>This stay­ca­tion was hosted by the ho­tel and is part of a weekly se­ries. For more stay­ca­tion re­views, go to str.sg/SuiteLife.</p>
