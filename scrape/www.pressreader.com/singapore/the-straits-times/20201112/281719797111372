    <p>There is no limit to the num­ber of times an en­dow­ment or life pol­icy can change own­er­ship.</p>
    <p>Here is a hy­po­thet­i­cal ex­am­ple of how the sums could work out for the per­son sell­ing his pol­icy and the buyer.</p>
    <p>If a pol­i­cy­holder had bought a 12-year en­dow­ment pol­icy and paid $6,000 a year for seven years, he would have paid a to­tal of $42,000. If he were to sur­ren­der the pol­icy to the in­surer now, he might get only $24,000.</p>
    <p>Usu­ally, a pol­i­cy­holder needs to pay for up to three quar­ters of a pol­icy term to break even. That means this pol­i­cy­holder would need to pay for nine years, or an­other two years, to get back the pre­mi­ums he had paid, with­out in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>If he needs money now or can­not con­tinue to pay the pre­mi­ums, it would make sense for him to sell the pol­icy to any­one who would pay him more than $24,000.</p>
    <p>If a buyer pays 10 per cent more for the pol­icy, which is $26,400, and pays the pre­mi­ums for two more years, he could get a pay­out of $54,000. For that amount, he would have paid a to­tal of $38,400.</p>
