    <p>A 20-year-old man pleaded guilty yesterday to hand­cuff­ing and blind­fold­ing a girl, then 13, be­fore com­mit­ting var­i­ous in­de­cent acts on her in a hand­i­capped toi­let at Plaza Sin­ga­pura last year.</p>
    <p>Alaric Lim Qix­ian was then a full-time na­tional ser­vice­man with the Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force (SCDF).</p>
    <p>The girl can­not be named be­cause of a gag order to pro­tect her iden­tity.</p>
    <p>District Judge Sharmila Sri­pa­thy called for pro­ba­tion and re­for­ma­tive train­ing re­ports to be made.</p>
    <p>Lim faces one charge of com­mit­ting an in­de­cent act with a child un­der the Chil­dren and Young Per­sons Act, as well as two charges of in­sult­ing the mod­esty of two women.</p>
    <p>The court heard that in March last year, Lim met the girl at a cos­play event be­fore they be­gan mes­sag­ing each other on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>He claimed to be a pho­tog­ra­pher who took what he called “risky” pic­tures of women wear­ing min­i­mal cloth­ing and of­fered to take such pic­tures of her.</p>
    <p>The girl said she wanted to take part in a photo shoot de­pict­ing bondage, dis­ci­pline or dom­i­na­tion, sadism and masochism, or BDSM, but clar­i­fied that she did not want to go fully naked.</p>
    <p>Lim then of­fered to give her a test run and sug­gested they go to an ob­scure part of a mall.</p>
    <p>After agree­ing to meet at Plaza Sin­ga­pura, they spent 15 min­utes on a mo­bile game be­fore Lim brought out a rope, a black blind­fold and black leather hand­cuffs. In a hand­i­capped toi­let on the fourth floor, he be­gan touch­ing her un­der her shirt. The court heard that the girl told him to stop and he with­drew his hands, but soon started lick­ing her.</p>
    <p>The or­deal lasted 15 min­utes and the girl felt “shocked and dis­gusted” but did not shout for help be­cause she was afraid of what Lim would do. Af­ter­wards, she took a bus home, show­ered and told her mother. They made a po­lice re­port the next day.</p>
    <p>Up­skirt videos of two women were later found on Lim’s phone. He had taken them at Bukit Pan­jang MRT sta­tion on Jan 8 and 11, 2018.</p>
    <p>Deputy Public Pros­e­cu­tor Joshua Phang noted that Lim had com­mit­ted “three se­ri­ous of­fences of a sex­ual na­ture”.</p>
    <p>Lim’s lawyer Richard Lim ar­gued that his client had met the girl at a cos­play event, and see­ing as this en­tailed role-play­ing char­ac­ters in cos­tume, his client did not believe his acts were sex­ual in na­ture. He said Lim was ad­mit­ted to the In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health in June last year for ad­just­ment disor­der and has been see­ing psy­chi­a­trists reg­u­larly.</p>
    <p>District Judge Sri­pa­thy noted that Lim showed “an es­ca­la­tion of sex­ual (of­fences) over a pe­riod of more than one year”.</p>
    <p>Lim’s case is sched­uled to be heard next on Nov 10.</p>
    <p>Lim faces one charge of com­mit­ting an in­de­cent act with a child un­der the Chil­dren and Young Per­sons Act, as well as two charges of in­sult­ing the mod­esty of two women.</p>
