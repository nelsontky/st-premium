    <p>The home owner who hosted an un­law­ful gath­er­ing in his Sengkang flat amid the Covid-19 out­break was fined $5,000 in a dis­trict court yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Leong Chee Mun, 37, pleaded guilty to an of­fence un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act.</p>
    <p>Eleven peo­ple linked to the case, in­clud­ing Leong’s former fi­ancee Cassie Ong Shi Hong, 32, were dealt with in court last month.</p>
    <p>Ong, who co-hosted the gath­er­ing, was sen­tenced to a fine of $4,000 on Aug 26.</p>
    <p>Ten of their guests were handed fines on Aug 5.</p>
    <p>Jack­son Tan Chia Ho and Jas­min Tan Ee Lin, both 30, were each fined $3,000.</p>
    <p>Poh Yang Ting, 21; Peh Si Qin, 22; Felisa Chua Jia Xuan, 23; Low Wei Hao, 25; Nic­man Lim Wei Fong, 25; Chee Min Hui, 27; Kho Zi Ting, 27; and Priscilia Tan Sze Hui, 32, were each fined $2,500.</p>
    <p>The cases in­volv­ing six other guests are still pend­ing.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod from April 7 to June 1, mem­bers of the pub­lic were not al­lowed to leave their places of res­i­dence with­out a valid rea­son or meet other peo­ple not liv­ing in the same place of res­i­dence for any so­cial pur­pose.</p>
    <p>De­spite this, Jack­son Tan and Jas­min Tan had been in Leong’s flat at Block 295C Com­pass­vale Cres­cent since around 6am on May 8, as they had had break­fast there.</p>
    <p>The other guests later turned up from around 9pm that day.</p>
    <p>While in the unit, the group min­gled and came into close con­tact with one another while do­ing var­i­ous ac­tiv­i­ties, such as eat­ing, drink­ing al­co­holic bev­er­ages, play­ing games and watch­ing Net­flix pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>A res­i­dent in the same block alerted the po­lice to the gath­er­ing around 2am the next day, stat­ing: “This has been go­ing on al­most every night.”</p>
    <p>A po­lice of­fi­cer, Sergeant Roy Tan, later ar­rived at the unit. When he rang the door­bell, he heard “hush­ing” noises com­ing from in­side. But no one opened the front door.</p>
    <p>The po­lice­man had to knock on the door, ring the door­bell nu­mer­ous times and wait for about three min­utes be­fore Leong fi­nally an­swered.</p>
    <p>Leong told Sgt Tan that he was the owner of the unit, and that he had been sleep­ing.</p>
    <p>He also lied to the of­fi­cer, claim­ing that he and Ong were the only ones there, the court heard. But the po­lice­man called his bluff and replied that he had heard noises com­ing from in­side the flat.</p>
    <p>Leong fi­nally ad­mit­ted that there was a gath­er­ing and po­lice later found the guests in­side the flat.</p>
