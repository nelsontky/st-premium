    <p>In the past five years, the in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing here han­dled a to­tal of 172 cases of sex­ual mis­con­duct com­mit­ted by stu­dents and staff.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter of State for Ed­u­ca­tion Sun Xuel­ing dis­closed this fig­ure in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day as she stressed her min­istry’s zero-tol­er­ance pol­icy to­wards such cases at Sin­ga­pore’s six au­ton­o­mous uni­ver­si­ties, five poly­tech­nics and the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion (ITE).</p>
    <p>Teach­ing staff and stu­dents are ex­pected to up­hold pro­fes­sional codes of con­duct in their in­ter­ac­tions, she said.</p>
    <p>“So when there is a breach of those codes of con­duct, the pun­ish­ments are swift,” said Ms Sun in re­sponse to Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mount­bat­ten), adding that both stu­dents and staff can be suspended or dis­missed from school for their ac­tions.</p>
    <p>The fig­ure of 172 sex­ual mis­con­duct cases be­tween 2015 and last year trans­lates into an in­ci­dence rate of 0.12 for ev­ery 1,000 staff and stu­dents, she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Sun’s re­sponse fol­lows the re­cent in­ci­dent in­volv­ing Dr Jeremy Fer­nando, a for­mer lec­turer and Tem­busu Col­lege fel­low at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS), who was sacked on Oct 7 for be­ing in an in­ti­mate re­la­tion­ship with an un­der­grad­u­ate – a breach of NUS’ code of con­duct for staff.</p>
    <p>The un­der­grad­u­ate, along with another stu­dent, also al­leged that Dr Fer­nando made non-con­sen­sual ad­vances to­wards them. NUS has filed a po­lice re­port.</p>
    <p>Ms Car­rie Tan (Nee Soon GRC) asked if the Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry plans to en­gage rel­e­vant ex­perts to pro­vide train­ing and sen­si­ti­sa­tion to staff on how to han­dle sex­ual as­sault cases, given that chil­dren are get­ting ex­posed to sex­ual ma­te­rial and con­tent at a much ear­lier age through dig­i­tal me­dia.</p>
    <p>To this, Ms Sun said NUS has set up a vic­tim care unit to han­dle cases of sex­ual as­sault and sim­i­lar units are in place at other au­ton­o­mous uni­ver­si­ties.</p>
    <p>On top of that, schools also pro­vide sex­u­al­ity ed­u­ca­tion that is tar­geted at dif­fer­ent age groups, with teach­ers pro­vid­ing spe­cific sce­nar­ios in se­condary schools so that stu­dents will know how they can pro­tect them­selves. Sex­u­al­ity ed­u­ca­tion teach­ers also re­ceive spe­cialised train­ing, she said.</p>
    <p>Work­ers’ Party MP He Ting Ru (Sengkang GRC) asked if investigat­ions into complaints about sex­ual vi­o­lence and sex­ual mis­con­duct can be con­ducted in­de­pen­dently – by par­ties out­side of the uni­ver­si­ties or i nsti­tu­tions where such cases have been re­ported.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing, Ms Sun said the po­lice carry out in­de­pen­dent investigat­ions when there are con­cerns about se­ri­ous of­fences that may have oc­curred, after a po­lice re­port has been made.</p>
    <p>Oth­er­wise, in in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing, a board of dis­ci­pline would be con­vened to in­ves­ti­gate the of­fence. Stu­dents are in­cluded on the board to pro­vide per­spec­tives on the is­sue.</p>
    <p>“Investigat­ions are car­ried out through cam­pus se­cu­rity and the is­sue is very se­ri­ously con­sid­ered by se­nior man­age­ment,” she added.</p>
    <p>Teach­ing staff and stu­dents are ex­pected to up­hold pro­fes­sional codes of con­duct in their in­ter­ac­tions, said Min­is­ter of State for Ed­u­ca­tion Sun Xuel­ing. “So when there is a breach of those codes of con­duct, the pun­ish­ments are swift,” she said.</p>
