    <p>When Mr Tan Kok Wah de­cided on a ca­reer switch to be­come a po­lice­man at the age of 25, some peo­ple tried to change his mind.</p>
    <p>“They told me, Mr Tan, your char­ac­ter is so soft, how can you be a po­lice­man?” he said.</p>
    <p>But the for­mer sales su­per­vi­sor at a de­part­ment store put his soft skills and af­fa­ble na­ture to good use, es­pe­cially dur­ing his stint at the Kreta Ayer Neigh­bour­hood Po­lice Post (NPP).</p>
    <p>Mr Tan, who re­tired this year at 62, fondly re­mem­bered the years he spent at the NPP, from 1995 to 2001.</p>
    <p>It is the only two-storey po­lice post in Sin­ga­pore, and one of nine sites on the newly launched Po­lice Her­itage Trail. It was also ar­guably one of the busiest NPPs, as it served a wide va­ri­ety of “cus­tomers”, re­called Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the day, busi­ness­men from the Cen­tral Busi­ness District would pop over to file re­ports on crimes in the of­fice. In the evening, how­ever, of­fi­cers would at­tend to dis­putes or man­age rowdy crowds at the nightlife es­tab­lish­ments in Cir­cu­lar Road, said Mr Tan, whose last rank was se­nior staff sergeant.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cers would also pa­trol res­i­den­tial es­tates in Chi­na­town and at­tend to res­i­dents’ com­plaints or re­ports, he added.</p>
    <p>It was here that Mr Tan shone as a neigh­bour­hood po­lice­man, pa­trolling the area of­ten and check­ing in on res­i­dents. The good rap­port he built with the res­i­dents made it eas­ier for him to keep the peace and fight crime, as peo­ple would ap­proach him and ac­cept his ad­vice.</p>
    <p>“I think the NPP sys­tem al­lowed the po­lice to have a more per­sonal touch when polic­ing,” said Mr Tan.</p>
