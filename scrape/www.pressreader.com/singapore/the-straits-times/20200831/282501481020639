    <p>More than five months into the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the early lock­down nov­elty of home­made cock­tails and vir­tual happy hours may be starting to wear thin.</p>
    <p>If you are seek­ing in­spi­ra­tion for your next quar­an­tini, try­ing to fig­ure out which wines to stock up on for au­tumn or just feel­ing wist­ful for the at­mos­phere at your neigh­bour­hood wa­ter­ing hole, there just might be a pod­cast out there to quench your thirst.</p>
    <p>LIFE BE­HIND BARS</p>
    <p>If you like your cock­tails served with a gen­er­ous dash of his­tor­i­cal con­text, you can­not go wrong with this deeply re­searched monthly show from The Daily Beast, which jug­gles broad trend pieces about the booze in­dus­try with deep dives into spe­cific drinks.</p>
    <p>One week, hosts Noah Roth­baum and David Won­drich might ex­plore the his­tory and evo­lu­tion of a clas­sic cock­tail like the Negroni; and the next, they might zoom out to dis­cuss the de­cline of the dive bar or mull over how bars can weather the chal­lenges of 2020.</p>
    <p>It is a per­fect com­fort lis­ten for the cu­ri­ous drinker.</p>
    <p>The Bars We Can’t Wait To Visit Again</p>
    <p>Starter episode: GOOD BEER HUNT­ING</p>
    <p>The Good Beer Hunt­ing col­lec­tive po­si­tions it­self as a one-stop shop for craft beer drinkers and pro­fes­sion­als alike.</p>
    <p>Founded al­most a decade ago, the com­pany of­fers mar­ket­ing and event plan­ning in ad­di­tion to long­form writ­ing and pho­tog­ra­phy ex­plor­ing ev­ery as­pect of the beer busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­lar episodes tend to fo­cus on in­ter­views with brew­ery own­ers and other beer en­trepreneur­s. Sight­lines episodes fo­cus on news, trends and pro­jec­tions about the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Starter episode:</p>
    <p>Sup­ply And De­mand In A Pan­icked Mar­ket</p>
    <p>WINE FOR NOR­MAL PEO­PLE</p>
    <p>This show is all about dis­man­tling the in­tim­i­da­tion fac­tor that comes with wine. Aimed at lis­ten­ers who “like wine, but not the snob­bery that goes with it”, it also of­fers some es­capism if you are miss­ing travel this sum­mer.</p>
    <p>With in­fec­tious en­thu­si­asm, host Elizabeth Sch­nei­der, a self-con­fessed “wine dork”, spot­lights dif­fer­ent wine­mak­ing re­gions around the world, from Italy to Le­banon to Aus­tralia. She also in­ter­views lo­cal ex­perts about the spe­cific his­tory and at­tributes of their wines.</p>
    <p>Some episodes fo­cus on more prac­ti­cal top­ics, like which fancy vino gad­gets you re­ally need or how to pick the per­fect wine as a hol­i­day gift.</p>
    <p>Starter episode:</p>
    <p>Le­banon</p>
    <p>Starter episode:</p>
    <p>The Wines Of</p>
    <p>BAR­TENDER AT LARGE POD­CAST</p>
    <p>Hosted with warmth and panache by San Diego-based ca­reer bar­tender Erick Cas­tro, this show has changed shape slightly this year, much like the in­dus­try it spot­lights.</p>
    <p>Since lock­downs be­gan in March, Bar­tender at Large has dealt with the prac­ti­cal im­pli­ca­tions of the pan­demic – how to make a re­ally great to-go cock­tail, for in­stance – as well as the men­tal health reper­cus­sions on bar­tenders.</p>
    <p>And if you would rather think about any­thing other than the pan­demic, there are plenty more ev­er­green sub­jects to pick from, like the mys­te­ri­ous for­mula for a great neigh­bour­hood bar or the be­hind-the-scenes process of pick­ing the World’s 50 Best Bars list.</p>
    <p>Chloe Frechette On Easy Tiki Drinks</p>
    <p>THE MOD­ERN BAR CART POD­CAST</p>
    <p>If the quar­an­tini era has in­spired you to stock your liquor cabi­net and per­fect a few clas­sic cock­tail recipes for the first time, here is a crash course you can get de­liv­ered right to your ears.</p>
    <p>Scroll all the way back to the show’s early episodes in 2017 to hear Eric Ko­z­lik’s guides on glass­ware, es­sen­tial liquors and flavour pro­files.</p>
    <p>Over the years, the show has fea­tured more in­ter­views with bar­tenders, dis­tillers and other al­co­hol afi­ciona­dos, along with seg­ments in which Ko­z­lik answers ques­tions from lis­ten­ers.</p>
    <p>Asked to de­fine the dif­fer­ence be­tween a fizz and spritz, he takes a de­light­ful foray into the wis­dom of a 19th-cen­tury bar­tender’s man­ual, ex­em­pli­fy­ing the show’s af­fa­ble blend of pas­sion and cu­rios­ity.</p>
    <p>Cock­tails In A</p>
    <p>Starter episode:</p>
    <p>Time Of Plague</p>
    <p>VINEPAIR POD­CAST</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal me­dia com­pany VinePair cov­ers news and trends from the drinks in­dus­try, but you do not need to be a wine­maker or mixol­o­gist to en­joy its punchy, thought­pro­vok­ing pod­cast.</p>
    <p>The show’s hosts – VinePair cofounder Adam Teeter, edi­tor-in­chief Erica Duecy and som­me­lier</p>
    <p>Zach Ge­balle – share some en­joy­ably strong opin­ions (Dry Jan­uary is dumb, and “sig­na­ture cock­tails” are over­rated, to name a few) and tackle seem­ingly es­o­teric sub­jects in ac­ces­si­ble and fas­ci­nat­ing ways.</p>
    <p>What Hap­pens When Sum­mer Drinking And So­cial Dis­tanc­ing Col­lide?</p>
    <p>Starter episode: UN­RE­SERVED WINE TALK</p>
    <p>How do you find the per­fect wine to pair with yoga? Or meat­less burg­ers?</p>
    <p>These are just a few of the off-the­beaten-path sub­jects that Cana­dian jour­nal­ist Natalie MacLean ex­plores in this en­gag­ing, un­pre­ten­tious se­ries. She also ex­plores wine trends and pop cul­tural rep­re­sen­ta­tions of wine.</p>
    <p>Some of the most mem­o­rable episodes ex­pand into broader con­ver­sa­tions about so­ci­ol­ogy and hu­man be­hav­iour. In re­cent weeks, MacLean has ex­plored gen­der dif­fer­ences in wine-buy­ing, how peo­ple’s drinking habits can be shaped by a movie like Side­ways (2004) and how the name of a wine af­fects the way that it tastes.</p>
    <p>How We Buy Wine Based On Se­cret Re­tail Trig­gers</p>
    <p>Starter episode:</p>
