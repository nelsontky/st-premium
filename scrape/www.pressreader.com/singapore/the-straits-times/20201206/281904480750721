    <p>• Women com­prise 17 per cent of Tesla’s US lead­er­ship roles and 21 per cent of the over­all work­force, the elec­tric-car maker dis­closed in its first US di­ver­sity re­port.</p>
    <p>“While women are his­tor­i­cally un­der-rep­re­sented in the tech and au­to­mo­tive in­dus­tries, we recog­nise we have work to do in this area,” the com­pany said in its Di­ver­sity, Eq­uity and In­clu­sion Im­pact Re­port.</p>
    <p>It said that over­all, mi­nori­ties and oth­ers from un­der-rep­re­sented com­mu­ni­ties make up more than half of its em­ploy­ees in the United States and a third of its di­rec­tors and vice-pres­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Black, African-Amer­i­can, His­panic, Lat­inx, Asian, Pa­cific Is­lan­der, Na­tive Amer­i­can, Na­tive Hawai­ian and Alaska Na­tive com­mu­ni­ties col­lec­tively rep­re­sent 60 per cent of the com­pany’s US work­force and 33 per cent of its se­nior man­agers, the com­pany said via a blog post last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The firm said lead­er­ship roles were a “very small co­hort”, or less than 0.4 per cent, of its work­force.</p>
    <p>Black and African-Amer­i­can em­ploy­ees make up a 10th of its US work­force, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>Mr Elon Musk’s Tesla, whose me­te­oric rise has seen it be­come the most valu­able auto com­pany in the world and worth about US$550 bil­lion (S$734 bil­lion), ac­knowl­edged the lack of representa­tion.</p>
    <p>“We know that our num­bers do not rep­re­sent the deep tal­ent pools of black and African-Amer­i­can tal­ents that ex­ist in the US at every level – from high-school grad­u­ates to pro­fes­sion­als,” it said.</p>
    <p>Tesla, based in Palo Alto, Cal­i­for­nia, said it planned to in­crease representa­tion of all un­der-rep­re­sented groups next year and would be re­cruit­ing at his­tor­i­cally black col­leges and uni­ver­si­ties.</p>
    <p>Nasdaq filed a pro­posal with the US Se­cu­ri­ties and Ex­change Com­mis­sion last Tues­day that, if ap­proved, would re­quire all its listed com­pa­nies to adopt new rules re­lated to board di­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>The rules would re­quire most of the com­pa­nies to have, or pub­licly ex­plain why they do not have, at least two di­verse di­rec­tors, in­clud­ing one who self­i­den­ti­fies as fe­male and one who self-iden­ti­fies as ei­ther an un­der-rep­re­sented mi­nor­ity or LGBTQ+.</p>
    <p>Tesla has over 60,000 em­ploy­ees glob­ally but has never pub­licly dis­closed its US di­ver­sity statis­tics un­til now, mak­ing it a bit of an out­lier in Sil­i­con Val­ley.</p>
