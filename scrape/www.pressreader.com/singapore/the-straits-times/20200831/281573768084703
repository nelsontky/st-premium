    <p>The re­cent Euro­pean tour of Chi­nese For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi re­veals the gaps in China’s charm of­fen­sive to­wards Europe, says global af­fairs cor­re­spon­dent Jonathan Eyal (below).</p>
    <p>LON­DON • The last week in Au­gust is not the best time to visit Europe for any­thing other than tourism.</p>
    <p>And yet that’s when Mr Wang Yi, China’s For­eign Min­is­ter, de­cided to make his first diplo­matic visit to the con­ti­nent since the start of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The coun­tries on Mr Wang’s cur­rent Euro­pean tour were care­fully hand­picked, and the list is in­dica­tive of Bei­jing’s ob­jec­tives. The Chi­nese For­eign Min­is­ter started his round of vis­its in Italy, the largest Western Euro­pean na­tion to join the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive. He then moved on to the Nether­lands, which is a growing tar­get for Chi­nese in­vest­ment in sec­tors rang­ing from mi­crochips to agri­cul­tural tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>From there, Mr Wang went to Nor­way, which in Jan­uary takes up a seat on the United Na­tions Se­cu­rity Coun­cil for the next two years, so its sup­port in in­ter­na­tional in­sti­tu­tions needs court­ing. Nor­way is also ea­ger to con­clude a free trade agree­ment with China af­ter spend­ing six long years in deep diplo­matic freeze, fol­low­ing Bei­jing’s out­rage at dis­si­dent Liu Xiaobo win­ning the No­bel Peace Prize in 2010.</p>
    <p>And Mr Wang’s tour con­cluded with France and Ger­many, ar­guably the Euro­pean Union’s most sig­nif­i­cant na­tions.</p>
    <p>As al­ways on such a trip, which coun­try was ex­cluded was just as sig­nif­i­cant as which one was in­cluded.</p>
    <p>There was no men­tion of Bri­tain – oth­er­wise Europe’s top in­vest­ment des­ti­na­tion, at­tract­ing more than dou­ble the vol­ume of in­vest­ment stock go­ing into Ger­many – largely be­cause the Bri­tish are now seen in Bei­jing as ir­re­deemably hos­tile to China.</p>
    <p>There was also no time in Mr Wang’s di­ary for a trip to the eastern part of Europe, which used to be wooed by Chi­nese of­fi­cials. And, stranger still, there was no time to visit Brus­sels, the cap­i­tal of the Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>No doubts what the trip was about: an at­tempt to de­flect from the ris­ing dis­en­chant­ment in Europe about China, cou­pled with the longer-term ob­jec­tive of en­sur­ing that Europe does not join the United States on a broader anti-Chi­nese plat­form. Mr Wang was act­ing, as the French news mag­a­zine Le Point neatly put it, as “Xi Jin­ping’s fire­fighter”, dous­ing the flames of anti-Chi­nese crit­i­cism.</p>
    <p>Su­per­fi­cially, he seems to have suc­ceeded. Ev­ery­where he went, Mr Wang got the now oblig­a­tory el­bow-to-el­bow pho­to­graph with his smil­ing lo­cal hosts, which in these days of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic serves as a sub­sti­tute for the old hand­shake. And ev­ery­where, the Chi­nese For­eign Min­is­ter got at least a fleet­ing ex­pres­sion of friend­ship, just enough to al­low China’s Xin­hua news agency to pro­claim all the vis­its as the per­fect diplo­matic tri­umph.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang even suc­ceeded in se­cur­ing an au­di­ence with French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron, a rare honour for any for­eign min­is­ter vis­it­ing Paris, and this came de­spite the fact that both Mr Macron and other Euro­pean lead­ers know fully well that, in re­al­ity, Mr Wang is hardly China’s true for­eign pol­icy de­ci­sion-maker.</p>
    <p>Yet such photo op­por­tu­ni­ties aside, the trip has done lit­tle to al­le­vi­ate Euro­pean wor­ries or change Euro­pean per­cep­tions.</p>
    <p>For not only did Mr Wang pre­dictably dis­miss any Euro­pean con­cerns about China’s hu­man rights record as ei­ther do­mes­tic is­sues which he won’t dis­cuss or prob­lems merely in­vented by an Amer­i­can slan­der cam­paign, but he also had noth­ing to say about what should be done to un­block Sino-Euro­pean in­vest­ment ne­go­ti­a­tions which have been stalled for years, nor did he al­lay Euro­pean fears about Huawei’s telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions equip­ment.</p>
    <p>In short, he ar­rived empty-handed and, un­sur­pris­ingly, also left empty-handed. The only ques­tion is whether of­fi­cials in Bei­jing un­der­stand that, if they seek Europe’s co­op­er­a­tion, they will need to do more than just dis­patch an of­fi­cial who speaks English, with the task of just pre­sid­ing over some wooden diplo­matic meet­ings.</p>
    <p>CHANG­ING EURO­PEAN VIEWS</p>
    <p>It is dif­fi­cult to over­es­ti­mate the sheer mag­ni­tude of the change in Europe’s per­spec­tives on China.</p>
    <p>The rea­son for this fun­da­men­tal change is not just the pan­demic but China’s over­all be­hav­iour, which has shat­tered some of the key as­sump­tions that Euro­pean pol­i­cy­mak­ers had about China’s in­ter­na­tional pro­file. Even more than US of­fi­cials, Euro­peans had for many years be­lieved that China would have an in­ter­est in up­hold­ing the global eco­nomic or­der, if only be­cause Bei­jing ben­e­fits most from the cur­rent rules-based, glob­alised trade.</p>
    <p>But events over the past few years and es­pe­cially over the past few months have in­di­cated that Bei­jing’s main ob­jec­tive is to limit China’s de­pen­dence on global sup­ply chains, or en­sure that it con­trols these sup­ply chains and uses them as levers for po­lit­i­cal in­flu­ence.</p>
    <p>Back in Jan­uary 2017 and im­me­di­ately af­ter US Pres­i­dent</p>
    <p>Donald Trump was elected,</p>
    <p>Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping was feted at the an­nual Davos get-to­gether of the world’s top politi­cians and busi­ness­men as the only leader able to save glob­al­i­sa­tion. To­day, most Euro­pean lead­ers – and all jour­nal­ists present at that oc­ca­sion – would be em­bar­rassed to be re­minded that they once hailed Mr Xi as the ul­ti­mate “Davos Man”.</p>
    <p>Euro­peans were also pas­sion­ate ad­vo­cates of the re­form of in­ter­na­tional in­sti­tu­tions in the hope that mem­ber­ship in such in­sti­tu­tions would “tame” China – as they saw it. In­stead, as the ex­pe­ri­ence of the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion and of other United Na­tions spe­cialised agen­cies at­tests, it is China which is tam­ing such en­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>And, fi­nally, Euro­peans used to be­lieve that China had no in­ter­est in de­stroy­ing the Euro­pean Union, as it was a key trad­ing part­ner for Bei­jing and po­ten­tially an al­ter­na­tive great power to the US. But China’s at­tempts to di­vide Euro­peans dur­ing the cur­rent health cri­sis, along with its of­ten dis­mis­sive and hos­tile lan­guage, pok­ing fun at the ap­par­ent de­fi­cien­cies of Euro­pean gov­ern­ments in re­spond­ing to the pan­demic, have dis­pelled even that as­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing his lat­est tour, For­eign Min­is­ter Wang tried to claim that all these Euro­pean mis­giv­ings are not just un­founded but also mere in­ven­tions, planted in Euro­pean minds by other gov­ern­ments which wish both Europe and China harm.</p>
    <p>“Our re­la­tions are suf­fer­ing from provo­ca­tions and dam­age from ex­ter­nal forces, so we must con­cen­trate on our com­mon in­ter­ests,” Mr Wang said in Europe; no prizes for guess­ing who those “forces” may be.</p>
    <p>“I want to em­pha­sise that China has never wanted to wage a cold war,” Mr Wang said. “We should not let other coun­tries do so, to push their own pri­vate in­ter­ests, dam­ag­ing the in­ter­ests of other na­tions,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang’s ap­peals do strike a chord in Europe. For al­though Europe’s sus­pi­cions about China’s con­duct are growing, few Euro­peans sub­scribe to the alarm calls is­sued by Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, since Euro­peans have long aban­doned any as­pi­ra­tions to be a global su­per­power, they also feel much less threat­ened by China’s rise than the US cur­rently is.</p>
    <p>And ar­gu­ments that the world is about to em­bark on a new cold war with China are in­stinc­tively re­jected by most Euro­peans as far-fetched, if only be­cause Euro­pean lead­ers per­ceive the old Cold War with the Soviet Union as their unique ex­pe­ri­ence, and not one to be re­peated.</p>
    <p>So, the Chi­nese For­eign Min­is­ter may be on to some­thing when he seeks to re­as­sure Euro­pean de­ci­sion-mak­ers that a show­down is far from in­evitable.</p>
    <p>EURO­PEAN PUB­LIC</p>
    <p>The snag is that the Chi­nese do not seem to un­der­stand that they have a prob­lem not only with Euro­pean lead­ers, but also with the wider</p>
    <p>Euro­pean pub­lic.</p>
    <p>All pub­lic opin­ion polls in­di­cate a cat­a­strophic col­lapse in China’s rep­u­ta­tion in Europe; a re­cent sur­vey by the Bri­tain-based re­search group In­sti­tute for Global Change found that al­most two-thirds of Bri­tish and French cit­i­zens now view Bei­jing as a “force for bad” in the world, more than the per­cent­ages of neg­a­tive opin­ions reg­is­tered among or­di­nary Amer­i­cans. And the num­ber of Euro­peans who iden­tify China as a force for good in the world is mea­sured in bare, sin­gle dig­its.</p>
    <p>What this means is that gone are the days when a Chi­nese for­eign min­is­ter could fly into Europe, mouth some gen­er­al­i­ties about “win-win” re­la­tions, tout some mega in­vest­ment projects and then fly off, sure in the knowl­edge that no­body would bother to check whether the multi­bil­lion in­vest­ment projects he promised ever ma­te­ri­alised.</p>
    <p>In­stead, ev­ery­where he went now, Mr Wang was dogged by lo­cal doubts and awk­ward ques­tions. In the Nether­lands, for in­stance, his hosts dis­pensed with a joint press con­fer­ence, and is­sued in­stead a statement claim­ing that the dis­cus­sion with Mr Wang con­cen­trated on Hong Kong and the fate of the Uighur Mus­lims in Xin­jiang. Tellingly, the Dutch statement made no men­tion of the eco­nomic or trade projects that Mr Wang may have dis­cussed.</p>
    <p>And ev­ery­where, many Euro­pean politi­cians crit­i­cised their gov­ern­ments for not be­ing more as­sertive with China.</p>
    <p>“Your si­lence dis­hon­ours France; your smile makes me ashamed,” tweeted Mr Raphael Glucks­mann, a French Euro­pean Parliament deputy, who has a quar­ter of a mil­lion fol­low­ers, in re­sponse to Pres­i­dent Macron’s pub­lished pho­to­graph with Mr Wang.</p>
    <p>China “dis­qual­i­fies it­self as a strate­gic and re­li­able part­ner” be­cause it is “push­ing through a to­tal­i­tar­ian nar­ra­tive in Europe as well”, reads an open let­ter sent to their govern­ment by Ger­man MPs from across the coun­try’s en­tire po­lit­i­cal spec­trum.</p>
    <p>The re­sult is that not only are the costs of be­ing friendly to China ris­ing for to­day’s Euro­pean politi­cians, but the in­cen­tive is also growing for all of them to keep their dis­tance from the Chi­nese.</p>
    <p>While Mr Wang may have been sat­is­fied by his achieve­ment of be­ing re­ceived by Mr Macron, he was prob­a­bly less im­pressed by the fact that at ex­actly the same time Tai­wan was al­lowed to open an­other of­fi­cial rep­re­sen­ta­tive of­fice in France, while French For­eign Min­is­ter Jean-Yves Le</p>
    <p>Drian told a con­fer­ence of his coun­try’s top em­ploy­ers that “China is both a part­ner, com­peti­tor and sys­temic ri­val”, all at the same time.</p>
    <p>In­deed, Mr Wang him­self un­der­scored the lim­i­ta­tions of China’s charm of­fen­sive in Europe when he warned his hosts in Nor­way about the costs they may have to pay if the next No­bel Peace Prize is awarded to, say, Hong Kong’s hu­man rights ac­tivists.</p>
    <p>China clearly wants to court Europe. But Bei­jing may also be adopt­ing the at­ti­tude of an old Roman em­peror two mil­len­nia ago, who re­marked that, if he can­not be loved by his sub­jects, he would be just as happy if they just feared him.</p>
