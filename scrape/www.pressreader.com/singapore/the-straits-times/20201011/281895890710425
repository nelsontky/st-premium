    <p>BAKU/YERE­VAN A shaky cease­fire be­tween Azer­bai­jan and eth­nic Ar­me­nian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh en­tered into force yes­ter­day af­ter a deal was struck in Moscow be­tween Azer­bai­jan and Ar­me­nia to al­low pris­on­ers and the bod­ies of the dead to be ex­changed.</p>
    <p>It was not im­me­di­ately clear how long the cease­fire, which be­gan at mid­day lo­cal time, would last and how ef­fec­tive it would be. There were re­ports from both sides of con­tin­ued fight­ing in the run-up to the cease­fire, and the two coun­tries also alleged se­ri­ous breaches af­ter it got un­der way.</p>
    <p>The Moscow cease­fire talks were the first diplo­matic con­tact be­tween the two sides since fight­ing over the moun­tain­ous en­clave erupted on Sept 27, killing hun­dreds of peo­ple. The en­clave is in­ter­na­tion­ally recog­nised as part of Azer­bai­jan, but is pop­u­lated and gov­erned by eth­nic Ar­me­ni­ans.</p>
    <p>Rus­sian For­eign Min­is­ter Sergei Lavrov, who helped me­di­ate be­tween the two sides, said in a state­ment yes­ter­day, af­ter over 10 hours of ne­go­ti­a­tions, that the cease­fire had been agreed to on hu­man­i­tar­ian grounds. The In­ter­na­tional Com­mit­tee of the Red Cross would help make the truce work, he added.</p>
    <p>“The spe­cific terms of the cease­fire still need to be agreed,” said Mr Lavrov, adding that Ar­me­nia and Azer­bai­jan had also agreed to en­ter into what he called sub­stan­tive peace talks.</p>
    <p>Those talks would be held un­der the aus­pices of the Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Se­cu­rity and Co­op­er­a­tion in Europe’s Minsk Group, he added.</p>
    <p>Ar­me­nian For­eign Min­is­ter</p>
    <p>Zohrab Mnat­sakanyan and his Az­eri coun­ter­part Jey­hun Bayra­mov did not speak to reporters in Moscow af­ter strik­ing the deal.</p>
    <p>But Mr Mnat­sakanyan later paid trib­ute on Ar­me­nian state TV to Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin, whom he said had played a key role in making sure the talks hap­pened and had per­son­ally in­ter­vened to help get an agreement.</p>
    <p>Turkey, which has strongly backed Azer­bai­jan, wel­comed the deal but said much more was needed. “The hu­man­i­tar­ian cease­fire is a sig­nif­i­cant first step but will not stand for a last­ing so­lu­tion,” the Turk­ish For­eign Min­istry said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“Turkey em­pha­sises that it will sup­port any so­lu­tion ap­proved by Azer­bai­jan. Turkey will con­tinue to stand by Azer­bai­jan in the field and at the ta­ble.”</p>
