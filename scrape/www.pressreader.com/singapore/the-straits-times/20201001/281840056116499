    <p>STOCK­HOLM Swe­den re­fused to im­pose a coro­n­avirus lock­down last spring, as the coun­try’s lead­ing health of­fi­cials ar­gued that lim­ited re­stric­tions were suf­fi­cient and would bet­ter pro­tect against eco­nomic col­lapse.</p>
    <p>It was an ap­proach that trans­formed Swe­den into an un­likely ide­o­log­i­cal light­ning rod.</p>
    <p>Many sci­en­tists blamed it for a spike in deaths, even as many lib­er­tar­i­ans crit­i­cal of lock­downs por­trayed the coun­try as a model.</p>
    <p>Back in the spring, when other na­tions were clamp­ing down, Swe­den was of­ten vil­i­fied for hav­ing gone its own way. Its bor­ders stayed open, as did bars, restau­rants and schools.</p>
    <p>Hair­dressers, yoga studios, gyms and even some cin­e­mas re­mained open, as did pub­lic trans­porta­tion and parks. Gath­er­ings of more than 50 peo­ple were banned, mu­se­ums were closed and sport­ing events were can­celled.</p>
    <p>But that was the ex­tent of the mea­sures, with of­fi­cials say­ing they would trust in the good sense of Swedes to keep their dis­tance and wash their hands.</p>
    <p>Some ex­perts be­lieve that Swe­den is now al­most fully in con­trol of the virus.</p>
    <p>Dr Kim Snep­pen, pro­fes­sor of bio­com­plex­ity at the Niels Bohr In­sti­tute in Copen­hagen, said: “There are in­di­ca­tions that the Swedes have gained an el­e­ment of im­mu­nity to the dis­ease, which, to­gether with ev­ery­thing else they are do­ing to pre­vent the in­fec­tion from spread­ing, is enough to keep the dis­ease down.”</p>
    <p>In­deed, com­par­a­tive analy­ses show that Swe­den’s death rate at the height of the pan­demic in the spring far sur­passed the rates in neigh­bour­ing coun­tries and was more pro­tracted.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers point out that the coun­try’s overall death rate is com­pa­ra­ble to that of the United States.</p>
    <p>Now, though, the ques­tion is whether Swe­den’s cur­rent low caseload, com­pared with sharp in­creases else­where, shows that it has found a sus­tain­able bal­ance – or whether the re­cent num­bers are just a tem­po­rary aber­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>With a pop­u­la­tion of 10.1 mil­lion, Swe­den av­er­aged just over 200 new cases a day for sev­eral weeks, al­though in re­cent days that num­ber has jumped to about 380.</p>
    <p>The per capita rate is far lower than nearby Den­mark or the Nether­lands – if higher than the neg­li­gi­ble rates in Nor­way and Fin­land. Swe­den is also do­ing far bet­ter, for the mo­ment, than Spain, with 10,000 cases a day, and France, with 12,000.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to the re­cent out­breaks, many Euro­pean coun­tries are im­pos­ing new re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>But po­lit­i­cal lead­ers, anx­ious to avoid un­pop­u­lar and eco­nom­i­cally dis­as­trous lock­downs, are re­ly­ing mostly on so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures while try­ing to pre­serve a de­gree of nor­malcy, with schools, shops, eater­ies and even bars open.</p>
    <p>In essence, some ex­perts say, they are qui­etly adopt­ing the Swedish ap­proach.</p>
    <p>Dr An­toine Fla­hault, direc­tor of the In­sti­tute of Global Health in Geneva, said: “To­day, all of the Euro­pean coun­tries are more or less fol­low­ing the Swedish model, com­bined with the test­ing, trac­ing and quar­an­tine pro­ce­dures the Ger­mans have in­tro­duced, but none will ad­mit it.”</p>
