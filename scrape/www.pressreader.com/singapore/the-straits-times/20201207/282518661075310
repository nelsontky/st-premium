    <p>MADRID Barcelona coach Ron­ald Koe­man lam­basted his play­ers for con­ced­ing a far­ci­cal goal in a 2-1 de­feat by pro­moted Cadiz on Satur­day, crit­i­cis­ing their at­ti­tude af­ter they slipped 12 points be­hind La Liga lead­ers Atletico Madrid.</p>
    <p>Al­varo Ne­gredo struck the win­ner af­ter a se­ries of sur­real mis­takes from the vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>Jordi Alba’s bun­gled throw-in flum­moxed Cle­ment Len­glet and goal­keeper Marc-An­dre ter Ste­gen kicked the loose ball against Ne­gredo, who glee­fully tapped home.</p>
    <p>“We lost be­cause of an in­cred­i­ble er­ror, that is not the level I ex­pect from my team,” Koe­man told Cata­lan net­work TV3 af­ter Barca’s fourth de­feat in 10 league games.</p>
    <p>“It shows we were not con­cen­trat­ing. The at­ti­tude was not good tonight. I’m very dis­ap­pointed and we have to im­prove.”</p>
    <p>Cadiz had not beaten Barca since 1991 but the hosts took an early lead thanks to more in­ept de­fend­ing fol­low­ing a cor­ner.</p>
    <p>The in­ex­pe­ri­enced Os­car Mingueza, play­ing only his sec­ond league game for Barca ow­ing to in­juries, nearly headed into his own net and the panic that en­sued al­lowed Al­varo Gimenez to pounce.</p>
    <p>Koe­man’s men equalised in the sec­ond half through an own goal by Pe­dro Al­cala only to fall be­hind again for good soon af­ter.</p>
    <p>The com­edy of er­rors which led to Cadiz’s win­ner was the third con­sec­u­tive away game dur­ing which Barca have made un­forced mis­takes and failed to win, leav­ing the Dutch­man a frus­trated fig­ure on the touch­line.</p>
    <p>“It’s very dif­fi­cult to ex­plain the goals we are con­ced­ing lately,” he said. “We also lacked ag­gres­sion when we didn’t have the ball to­day. We had highs and lows dur­ing the game and also in our at­ti­tude.”</p>
    <p>Barca lost last sea­son’s ti­tle to Real Madrid on the penul­ti­mate day of the cam­paign but are now floun­der­ing in the ti­tle race with lit­tle more than a quar­ter of the sea­son played. “It’s a gi­gan­tic step back for our chances of fight­ing for the ti­tle,” Koe­man added.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, Real de­feated Sevilla 1-0 away to record their first win in La Liga since Oc­to­ber, eas­ing the pres­sure on coach Zine­dine Zi­dane as they moved up to third.</p>
