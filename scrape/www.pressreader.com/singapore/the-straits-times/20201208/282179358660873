    <p>Like most other of­fice build­ings in the Cen­tral Business District, Re­pub­lic Plaza is a qui­eter place th­ese days as work­ing from home has be­come the new norm.</p>
    <p>But if and when more peo­ple who work there re­turn, they will find that the time it takes to get to any of the build­ing’s 66 floors has been cut by as much as half.</p>
    <p>This is thanks to a new con­tact­less e-call func­tion that al­lows users to call for a lift with their smart­phones, re­duc­ing wait­ing time and con­ges­tion at Re­pub­lic Plaza’s lift lob­bies.</p>
    <p>The e-call func­tion, be­ing launched to­day by Re­pub­lic Plaza’s owner City De­vel­op­ments Lim­ited (CDL), is the first of its kind in Sin­ga­pore. It is built into CDL’s smart build­ing app Ci­tyNexus.</p>
    <p>CDL worked with Amer­i­can lift­maker Otis World­wide to de­velop the func­tion, which makes use of mo­bile data or Wi-Fi con­nec­tion to send data from a smart­phone to servers within the build­ing.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes lo­ca­tion data, and users must be in the vicin­ity of the build­ing to be able to call for a lift.</p>
    <p>On the app, users need to se­lect the floor they are on and their des­ti­na­tion floor be­fore tap­ping a but­ton to call for a lift. An al­go­rithm then pro­cesses the re­quest and as­signs the user a lift al­most im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing peak hours, the al­go­rithm is able to man­age over­crowd­ing and as­sign users who are go­ing to the same or nearby floors to the same lift.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age daily pas­sen­ger load for the 15 lifts at Re­pub­lic Plaza in Jan­uary, be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic struck, was around 4,000.</p>
    <p>CDL com­mer­cial di­vi­sion chief executive of­fi­cer Yvonne Ong said the com­pany started to look at up­grad­ing its lifts last year to man­age crowd den­sity.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to im­prove ser­vice,</p>
    <p>We wanted to im­prove ser­vice, but not at a huge ex­pense in man­power costs. It’s op­por­tune that we have been able to reap the op­er­a­tional ben­e­fits dur­ing this Covid-19 pe­riod, when we needed to ef­fec­tively re­duce lift ca­pac­ity and didn’t want to ’’ do it man­u­ally.</p>

    <p>but not at a huge ex­pense in man­power costs,” she said.</p>
    <p>“It’s op­por­tune that we have been able to reap the op­er­a­tional ben­e­fits dur­ing this Covid-19 pe­riod, when we needed to ef­fec­tively re­duce lift ca­pac­ity and didn’t want to do it man­u­ally.”</p>
    <p>CDL l aunched its Ci­tyNexus app in Septem­ber last year, and wanted to work with Otis to in­cor­po­rate the lat­ter’s e-call func­tion into the app, even though do­ing so would in­volve more time and ef­fort than out­sourc­ing to a ser­vice provider.</p>
    <p>“We re­alised that t he pain points pe­cu­liar to our build­ing could not be ad­dressed fully by a third-party so­lu­tion alone,” Ms Ong said.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing the (e-call func­tion) within our app also makes more sense for our ten­ants, be­cause no one would want to down­load an­other app just to use one func­tion.”</p>
    <p>CDL has plans to i ntro­duce more fea­tures into its app.</p>
    <p>By the end of this month, it will roll out an up­graded vis­i­tor in­vi­ta­tion fea­ture, which will al­low vis­i­tors to Re­pub­lic Plaza to pre-reg­is­ter via the MyInfo tab in the Gov­ern­ment’s SingPass Mo­bile app, re­mov­ing the need to in­ter­act with the concierges.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors cur­rently need to reg­is­ter at the counter be­fore be­ing al­lowed through the turn­stiles, even af­ter re­ceiv­ing a dig­i­tal in­vi­ta­tion with a QR code from ten­ants via the app.</p>
    <p>The com­pany is also work­ing on a fea­ture that will al­low users of the Ci­tyNexus app to make pur­chases from re­tail­ers in any of CDL’s prop­er­ties, such as City Square Mall and Delfi Or­chard, and have the items de­liv­ered to their doorsteps.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese are the dis­tin­guish­ing fea­tures that will help the app stick (with users), and show the priv­i­leges of be­ing our client,” said Ms Ong.</p>
