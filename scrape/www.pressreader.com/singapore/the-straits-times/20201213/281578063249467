    <p>There were eight new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,313.</p>
    <p>All were im­ported cases who had been placed on stay-home no­tice (SHN) or iso­lated on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>They in­clude five Sin­ga­pore­ans and one Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent who had re­turned from Nepal, Bri­tain and In­dia.</p>
    <p>The per­ma­nent res­i­dent was the only one who was symp­to­matic, with symp­toms sur­fac­ing on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The rest were asymp­to­matic and were picked up when they were tested while serv­ing their SHN.</p>
    <p>Two other cases were de­pen­dant’s pass hold­ers who ar­rived from the United States and Mal­dives.</p>
    <p>The ages of the eight new cases ranged from 19 to 59.</p>
    <p>MOH said the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with no new cases in the past week.</p>
    <p>There are cur­rently 28 cases still in hos­pi­tal, and none in the in­ten­sive care unit.</p>
    <p>Fifty-nine cases, who have mild symp­toms or are clin­i­cally well but still test pos­i­tive for Covid-19, are iso­lated and cared for at com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Five more cases were dis­charged yes­ter­day, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 29 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, the virus out­break, which be­gan in De­cem­ber last year, has in­fected more than 71.6 mil­lion peo­ple. More than 1.6 mil­lion peo­ple have died.</p>
