    <p>Trees are of­ten touted as na­ture’s quick fix for cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>They take in car­bon diox­ide and pro­vide oxy­gen in re­turn – a seem­ingly free so­lu­tion to re­duc­ing the amount of the heat-trap­ping gas in the at­mos­phere.</p>
    <p>But a new study led by Sin­ga­pore sci­en­tists has shown that re­for­esta­tion in South-east Asia could come with a hefty price tag.</p>
    <p>The di­rect and in­di­rect costs of re­for­est­ing the re­gion, cou­pled with other con­straints, could dras­ti­cally re­duce the amount of land avail­able for re­for­esta­tion, the sci­en­tists found.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers had mapped out the land suit­able for re­for­esta­tion in South-east Asia, and found that about 121 mil­lion ha – an area al­most five times the size of Bri­tain – was avail­able.</p>
    <p>But if costs and other con­straints were fac­tored into the anal­y­sis, it may be prac­ti­cal to re­for­est just 0.4 per cent to 17 per cent of this area.</p>
    <p>Three types of con­straints were con­sid­ered: the costs of re­for­esta­tion, al­ter­na­tives for land use and op­er­a­tional fea­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the re­searchers cal­cu­lated the di­rect and i ndi­rect costs of re­for­esta­tion, such as the need for con­stant site main­te­nance, and the op­por­tu­nity costs of not us­ing the land to grow crops for sale.</p>
    <p>Fac­tor­ing these costs into the cost-ben­e­fit anal­y­sis shrank the area suit­able for plant­ing trees by be­tween 50 per cent and 87 per cent, de­pend­ing on whether a low, mod­er­ate or high cost op­tion was se­lected.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers fur­ther nar­rowed down this area by fac­tor­ing in land-use con­straints, such as set­ting aside land that is cur­rently be­ing used for agri­cul­ture by large agro­forestry com­pa­nies and small com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Lastly, they also con­sid­ered op­er­a­tional con­straints, nar­row­ing down ar­eas fea­si­ble for re­for­esta­tion to plots with low de­for­esta­tion risk, le­gal pro­tec­tion, a close prox­im­ity to seed sources and ar­eas that are easy to mon­i­tor.</p>
    <p>“Our anal­y­sis shows that when a com­bi­na­tion of fi­nan­cial, land-use and op­er­a­tional con­straints are taken into ac­count, only a frac­tion of the cli­mate mit­i­ga­tion po­ten­tial of re­for­esta­tion may be achiev­able,” noted the au­thors.</p>
    <p>The study was pub­lished on Mon­day in the sci­en­tific jour­nal Na­ture Cli­mate Change.</p>
    <p>National Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) con­ser­va­tion sci­en­tist Koh Lian Pin, who su­per­vised the re­search, said the study was the first to take a re­al­is­tic look at re­for­esta­tion in South-east Asia by con­sid­er­ing such prac­ti­cal con­straints.</p>
    <p>Said Pro­fes­sor Koh, who helms the new NUS Cen­tre for Na­ture­based Cli­mate So­lu­tions: “The study’s key take-home mes­sage is that the the­o­ret­i­cal ben­e­fit of re­for­esta­tion, or any cli­mate so­lu­tion, for that mat­ter, needs to be tem­pered with a proper ac­count­ing of on-the-ground re­al­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>The most lim­it­ing sce­nario that ac­counted for all three con­straints – fi­nan­cial, so­cial and op­er­a­tional – showed that just 0.4 per cent to 6 per cent of the 121 mil­lion ha of land can be re­for­ested, said the lead au­thor of the study, Dr Zeng Yi­wen, a post-doc­toral fel­low at NUS.</p>
    <p>But the study also pointed to ways to over­come straints.</p>
    <p>“Even a mod­er­ate re­duc­tion in op­por­tu­nity costs could al­most dou­ble the cli­mate mit­i­ga­tion po­ten­tial of re­for­esta­tion,” said Dr Zeng.</p>
    <p>This could in­clude so­lu­tions such as in­volv­ing farm­ers in the re­for­esta­tion process through agro­forestry ini­tia­tives, he said.</p>
    <p>Such ef­forts, which in­volve the plant­ing of stands of forests on agri­cul­tural land, could al­low re­for­esta­tion to be car­ried out with­out com­pro­mis­ing on com­mu­nity liveli­hoods or food se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Nophea Sasaki, a forestry and car­bon ex­pert at the Asian In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy in Thai­land who was not in­volved in the lat­est study, said the paper pro­vides use­ful in­for­ma­tion about the po­ten­tial land avail­abil­ity for re­for­esta­tion in South-east Asia and the im­pli­ca­tions for cli­mate pol­icy.</p>
    <p>“Re­for­esta­tion can also im­prove ecosys­tem func­tions and ser­vices, and stim­u­late lo­cal eco­nomic growth through job creation and con­ser­va­tion of bio­di­ver­sity,” said Prof Sasaki.</p>
    <p>But he noted the im­por­tance of se­lect­ing the right tree species for re­for­esta­tion, as choos­ing non-na­tive species could have ad­verse con­se­quences for the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>More re­search needs to be done on how re­for­ested lands can be man­aged to in­form pol­icy, he said.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, plant­ing a sin­gle fast-grow­ing ex­otic tree species could pro­vide a steady sup­ply of wood, but would neg­a­tively im­pact the ground, sur­face wa­ter and for­est-dwelling an­i­mals that rely on a di­ver­sity of na­tive plants for food.</p>
    <p>“Fur­ther study on how to man­age the re­for­ested lands could pro­vide more in­sight about bal­anc­ing re­for­esta­tion with the need to meet in­creas­ing de­mand for raw ma­te­ri­als,” Prof Sasaki said.</p>
    <p>Re­for­esta­tion has been gain­ing trac­tion among pol­i­cy­mak­ers as a na­ture-based cli­mate so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum in Jan­uary, for ex­am­ple, the One Tril­lion Tree ini­tia­tive was launched to urge gov­ern­ments, com­pa­nies and grass­roots or­gan­i­sa­tions to plant new trees and avoid de­for­esta­tion.</p>
    <p>In April, Sin­ga­pore launched a One Mil­lion Trees move­ment, which aims to plant a mil­lion trees or more over the next decade.</p>
    <p>Dr Adrian Loo, group di­rec­tor at the National Parks Board (NParks), said the in­ten­si­fi­ca­tion of tree plant­ing is pos­si­ble through the ap­pli­ca­tion of ecol­ogy and science.</p>
    <p>He pointed to the road­side plant­ing of na­tive trees and shrubs, say­ing these “na­ture ways” adopt the tiered struc­ture of Sin­ga­pore’s forests and sup­port na­tive bio­di­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>“Over time, a nat­u­ral and sus­tain­able land­scape will es­tab­lish,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Loo also pointed to the im­por­tance of in­volv­ing the com­mu­nity in the move­ment, say­ing that part­ners such as NUS and Kep­pel Corp have com­mit­ted to ei­ther plant­ing more trees on their premises, or con­tribut­ing funds to plant trees in Sin­ga­pore’s parks and na­ture re­serves.</p>
    <p>He added: “With the sup­port of the com­mu­nity and cor­po­rate part­ners, NParks hopes to gal­vanise wider com­mu­nity ac­tion and sus­tain ac­tive stew­ard­ship of the en­vi­ron­ment into the fu­ture.” these con</p>
    <p>A new study led by Sin­ga­pore re­searchers has mapped out land avail­able for re­for­esta­tion in South-east Asia af­ter ac­count­ing for trade-offs. By con­sid­er­ing fac­tors such as costs in­curred from re­for­esta­tion, land use con­straints and op­er­a­tional con­cerns, they found that land avail­able for re­for­esta­tion could be re­duced dras­ti­cally.</p>
