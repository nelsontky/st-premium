    <p>More peo­ple are look­ing to switch ca­reers and be­come nurses through a pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­gramme for mid-ca­reer in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of ap­pli­cants for Work­force Sin­ga­pore’s (WSG) Pro­fes­sional Con­ver­sion Pro­gramme (PCP) for Reg­is­tered Nurses (Diploma) has in­creased three times for the up­com­ing in­take next month, com­pared with the April in­take.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, ap­pli­ca­tion num­bers from the past few in­takes for the pro­gramme have “gen­er­ally been sta­ble”, said WSG’s di­rec­tor of the health­care, so­cial and busi­ness ser­vices di­vi­sion, Ms Safrah Eu­soof.</p>
    <p>One of the rea­sons for the ris­ing in­ter­est in nurs­ing among mid-ca­reer in­di­vid­u­als could be the Covid-19 pan­demic, which has cre­ated more aware­ness and ap­pre­ci­a­tion of nurs­ing as a ca­reer, she said.</p>
    <p>An­other rea­son could be public­ity ef­forts be­tween WSG and the Health Min­istry to fea­ture mid-ca­reer in­di­vid­u­als who have suc­cess­fully made the tran­si­tion to nurs­ing, she added.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme was orig­i­nally in­tro­duced in 2003 as the Strate­gic Man­power Con­ver­sion Pro­gramme, then re­branded in 2008 as the PCP for Reg­is­tered Nurses (Diploma).</p>
    <p>The de­gree equiv­a­lent of the pro­gramme was launched in 2018.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent PCP for En­rolled Nurses re­placed in 2014 the pre­vi­ous place-and-train pro­gramme for En­rolled Nurses, which was in­tro­duced in 2006.</p>
    <p>Since 2003, more than 1,350 mid­ca­reer Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents have taken part in the three pro­grammes, in­clud­ing 70 who en­rolled this year, said WSG.</p>
    <p>One of them is Mr Nigel Leong, who at 48 years old is fi­nally pur­su­ing his first pas­sion, nearly three decades af­ter he was dis­suaded by his par­ents from study­ing nurs­ing.</p>
    <p>This year, the for­mer re­gional qual­ity man­ager at a multi­na­tional com­pany ten­dered his res­ig­na­tion and took a sig­nif­i­cant pay cut to join the PCP for Reg­is­tered Nurses (De­gree) in April.</p>
    <p>He turned down lu­cra­tive job of­fers from other com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing one that would al­low him to re­lo­cate to Switzer­land, and de­cided to make the switch to nurs­ing to con­trib­ute back to so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong, who is sin­gle, is ex­pected to grad­u­ate from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Alice Lee Cen­tre for Nurs­ing Stud­ies in 2022 as a staff nurse work­ing for SingHealth Com­mu­nity Hos­pi­tals (SCH).</p>
    <p>He is one of 18 par­tic­i­pants of PCP for Reg­is­tered Nurses pro­grammes over the years who have been spon­sored by SCH.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong said his pas­sion for health­care started when he was a com­bat medic while do­ing his na­tional ser­vice.</p>
    <p>“It prompted me to want to pur­sue a de­gree in nurs­ing in Syd­ney, but un­for­tu­nately, my par­ents were against it be­cause of the stigma as­so­ci­ated with nurs­ing – in the 1990s, it was seen as a lowly job.</p>
    <p>“My fa­ther asked me why he should in­vest so much money for me to study in Syd­ney to ‘clean peo­ple’s back­sides’,” he added with a chuckle.</p>
    <p>He did a de­gree in food sci­ence in­stead, and re­mained in that in­dus­try for 23 years un­til he made the ca­reer switch.</p>
    <p>Ms Stephanie Yeap, di­rec­tor of nurs­ing at SCH, said the work­ing ex­pe­ri­ence of mid-ca­reer in­di­vid­u­als pro­vides them with a “dif­fer­ent out­look and per­spec­tive in their care de­liv­ery”, with skill sets that may com­ple­ment their clin­i­cal skills.</p>
    <p>She added that mid-ca­reer nurses also tend to have a stronger pas­sion and drive for nurs­ing.</p>
    <p>“These mid-ca­reer nurses are at the stage of life where they un­der­stand them­selves bet­ter and know what sort of ca­reer would suit them best,” said Ms Yeap.</p>
