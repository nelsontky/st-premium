        <p>A full-time na­tional ser­vice­man (NSF) who died of heat­stroke in April 2018 was taken to a med­i­cal cen­tre about 40 min­utes af­ter he was seen with signs of heat in­jury, in­ves­ti­ga­tions re­vealed. The de­lay in the evac­u­a­tion was a con­tribut­ing fac­tor in his death, the state coro­ner heard yes­ter­day in an in­quiry into the NSF’s death.</p>
        <p>A full-time na­tional ser­vice­man (NSF) who died of heat­stroke in April 2018 was taken to a med­i­cal cen­tre about 40 mins af­ter he was seen with signs of heat in­jury, in­ves­ti­ga­tions re­vealed.</p>
        <p>The de­lay in the evac­u­a­tion was a con­tribut­ing fac­tor in Cor­po­ral First Class (CFC) Dave Lee Han Xuan’s death, the state coro­ner heard yes­ter­day in an in­quiry into the NSF’s death.</p>
        <p>CFC Lee, then 19 and a guards­man from the 1st Bat­tal­ion Sin­ga­pore Guards, col­lapsed right af­ter com­plet­ing a 8km fast march at Be­dok Camp on April 18.</p>
        <p>He was later ad­mit­ted into Changi Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal (CGH) and died on April 30, 2018.</p>
        <p>The late Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces (SAF) Cap­tain Tan Baoshu, who was the su­per­vis­ing of­fi­cer of the fast march, was charged in Oc­to­ber 2018 with caus­ing death by per­form­ing a rash act. He was also ac­cused of dis­al­low­ing the nec­es­sary treat­ment for CFC Lee.</p>
        <p>Tan, 33, was given a dis­charge not amount­ing to an ac­quit­tal in Jan­uary last year, af­ter he was di­ag­nosed with stage 4 can­cer. He died on Feb 13 last year.</p>
        <p>Sta­tion In­spec­tor (SI) Ali­den Ha­mad, the in­ves­ti­ga­tion of­fi­cer on this case, said CFC Lee was ob­served to be in­co­her­ent, breath­ing heav­ily and drool­ing af­ter he crossed the fin­ish­ing line at 8.25am. Ice packs were ap­plied to his body and wa­ter sprayed on his face.He was given iso­tonic wa­ter but was un­able to swal­low it.</p>
        <p>SI Ali­den said the medic for the fast march failed to di­ag­nose CFC Lee as hav­ing heat in­jury. He added that Capt Tan re­jected sug­ges­tions from other army per­son­nel to evac­u­ate the NSF to the camp’s med­i­cal cen­tre, say­ing the sol­dier was only suf­fer­ing from phys­i­cal ex­haus­tion and would re­cover af­ter rest­ing.</p>
        <p>The of­fi­cer also re­jected a sug­ges­tion for CFC Lee to be ad­min­is­tered an in­tra­venous drip and in­stead di­rected that a ground sheet be used to cover the NSF.</p>
        <p>The of­fi­cer later or­dered for CFC Lee to be evac­u­ated, and he ar­rived at the camp’s med­i­cal cen­tre at around 9.05am.</p>
        <p>De­spite re­ceiv­ing med­i­cal treat­ment at the cen­tre and later at CGH, he even­tu­ally died.</p>
        <p>SI Ali­den said the de­lay in evac­u­a­tion was a con­tribut­ing fac­tor in his death, but no foul play is sus­pected.</p>
        <p>Dr Ken­neth Heng, who was ap­pointed to give an in­de­pen­dent med­i­cal re­port, said cov­er­ing CFC Lee with a ground sheet was coun­ter­pro­duc­tive. The NSF would not have been able to sweat, he said.</p>
        <p>He added that CFC Lee should have been moved to a shady area and fanned with his shirt re­moved to in­crease sweat evap­o­ra­tion.</p>
        <p>Evac­u­at­ing him to the med­i­cal cen­tre should have been a pri­or­ity, with a 40 min de­lay to do so “too long”, the doc­tor said, not­ing that a 10-15 minute de­lay would have been rea­son­able.</p>
        <p>Not­ing that CFC Lee’s pla­toon was made to do phys­i­cal ac­tiv­i­ties in­clud­ing push-ups the night be­fore, he said the ex­er­tion and sub­se­quent re­duced rest might have con­trib­uted to the heat­stroke.</p>
        <p>State Coro­ner Ka­mala will give her find­ings on Jan 27.</p>
        <p>Since the case, the SAF has in­tro­duced en­hance­ments to ex­ist­ing heat in­jury man­age­ment and pre­ven­tion mea­sures, such as a sim­pli­fied evac­u­a­tion pro­to­col.</p>
        <p>Six other SAF ser­vice­men were charged in mil­i­tary court over CFC Lee’s death and were last Septem­ber fined be­tween $1,800 and $4,500 each. Three of them were also de­moted from the rank of third sergeant (NS) to cor­po­ral.</p>
