    <p>• There is no short­age of su­perla­tives for Ant Group’s ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO). Here is a look at some of the key met­rics, and why bil­lion­aire Jack Ma seems to be such a fan of the num­ber eight.</p>
    <p>IPO: US$34.5 BIL­LION</p>
    <p>Ant’s US$34.5 bil­lion (S$46.9 bil­lion) IPO blows past the pre­vi­ous record, set last year by Saudi Aramco at US$29 bil­lion. Ant’s fund rais­ing ex­er­cise is ex­pected to jump another US$5.2 bil­lion once bankers sell ad­di­tional shares to meet de­mand in what is known as the green­shoe op­tion. The ac­com­pa­ny­ing chart of the 10 big­gest IPOs also re­flects the grow­ing eco­nomic clout of Asia. The top five are all from Asia or the Mid­dle East, and eight of the 10 are from the re­gion, in­clud­ing Mr Ma’s on­line gi­ant Alibaba Group Hold­ing and Ja­pan’s SoftBank Group.</p>
    <p>VAL­U­A­TION: US$315 BIL­LION</p>
    <p>Ant’s IPO puts the com­pany’s val­u­a­tion at dizzy­ing heights. At about US$315 bil­lion, Ant is worth more than the gross do­mes­tic prod­ucts of Egypt, Chile or Fin­land. For cor­po­rate com­par­isons, it is big­ger than JPMor­gan Chase, the big­gest bank in the United States. Ant is larger than its pay­ment ri­val Paypal, me­dia gi­ant Walt Dis­ney and dwarfs Bank of Amer­ica. It is three times big­ger than tech gi­ant IBM and four times larger than Gold­man Sachs.</p>
    <p>LUCKY NUM­BER 8</p>
    <p>Mr Ma ap­pears to be a big fan of the No. 8, which is of­ten as­so­ci­ated with wealth in China. Eight is pro­nounced “ba” and rhymes with the word for “pros­per­ity” or “get­ting rich” in Man­darin. As a re­sult, cou­ples of­ten try to get mar­ried in Au­gust, the eighth month, while eight is also a pop­u­lar num­ber for street ad­dresses and apart­ment floors. The open­ing cer­e­monies of the 2008 Bei­jing Sum­mer Olympics be­gan at 8pm on Aug 8.</p>
    <p>Ant is knee-deep in eight. The stock ticker in Shang­hai will be 688688; in Hong Kong it is 6688. Six is also con­sid­ered a lucky num­ber in China. The shares were priced in Shang­hai at 68.8 yuan and at HK$80 in Hong Kong. Mr Ma’s Alibaba Group, which owns about a third of Ant, trades un­der the ticker 9988 in Hong Kong. The fo­cus on eight seems to be work­ing for Mr Ma. Alibaba has soared since its Hong Kong list­ing last year, up 69 per cent, trounc­ing the Hang Seng in­dex, which is down 8 per cent over that pe­riod.</p>
    <p>76 BIL­LION SHARES</p>
    <p>Ant’s IPO was ex­pected to at­tract in­vestors from all over the world and that has borne out in the de­mand for shares. In­sti­tu­tional in­vestors put in or­ders for 76 bil­lion shares, more than 284 times the ini­tial of­fer­ing, ac­cord­ing to the Shang­hai fil­ing. Bro­kers were will­ing to lend in­di­vid­ual in­vestors credit worth 20 times their in­vest­ment so they could load up on the shares. Ant is plan­ning to stop tak­ing in­vestor or­ders for the Hong Kong leg a day ear­lier than sched­uled as the share sale has al­ready been heav­ily sub­scribed, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>MA’S FOR­TUNE</p>
    <p>Mr Ma, a for­mer English teacher, co-founded Alibaba in 1999 with US$60,000, and he is poised to be­come the world’s 11th-rich­est per­son af­ter the Ant IPO.</p>
    <p>His 8.8 per cent stake is worth US$27.4 bil­lion based on the stock pric­ing in Hong Kong and Shang­hai. That will lift the 56-year-old’s for­tune to US$71.6 bil­lion on the Bloomberg Bil­lion­aires In­dex, ex­ceed­ing that of Or­a­cle’s Larry El­li­son, L’Oreal heiress Fran­coise Bet­ten­court Mey­ers and in­di­vid­ual mem­bers of the Wal­tons, whose fam­ily own Wal­mart.</p>
