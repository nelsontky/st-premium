    <p>Em­bat­tled Malaysian leader Muhyid­din Yassin has weath­ered a seem­ingly un­end­ing storm since be­ing sworn in as prime min­is­ter on March 1.</p>
    <p>In the past eight months, he has fended off no-con­fi­dence mo­tions and po­ten­tial de­fec­tions, ex­er­cis­ing the full ex­tent of his ex­ec­u­tive pow­ers to re­main at the helm.</p>
    <p>He has al­ready de­layed one par­lia­men­tary sit­ting and cut short an­other, plead­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, and shored up sup­port by ap­point­ing over 90 per cent of the 113 MPs in his Perikatan Na­sional (PN) pact to po­si­tions in state-linked cor­po­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Cabi­net min­is­ters and close relations of gov­ern­ment lead­ers have been let off with just a slap on the wrist af­ter breach­ing rules meant to curb the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Now, he is set to by­pass the need for par­lia­men­tary ap­proval of gov­ern­ment spend­ing for next year.</p>
    <p>Bud­get 2021 was due to be heard and de­bated by the 222-strong Par­lia­ment next month, pre­sent­ing an op­por­tu­nity for Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s ri­vals to test his much-spec­u­lated-on ma­jor­ity in the fed­eral leg­is­la­ture.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim claimed a month ago that he had wrested con­trol of Par­lia­ment from the Prime Min­is­ter. It has be­come clear in re­cent days that sup­port for Datuk Seri An­war was largely fu­elled by Umno’s un­hap­pi­ness at hav­ing to play se­cond fid­dle to Mr Muhyid­din’s Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia, de­spite Umno be­ing the largest party in the rul­ing PN.</p>
    <p>Although Umno pres­i­dent</p>
    <p>Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi on Wed­nes­day in­sisted that his party would con­tinue to back the Muhyid­din ad­min­is­tra­tion, doubts linger over whether the gov­ern­ment can push the cru­cial Bud­get 2021 through Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Faced with this prospect, Mr</p>
    <p>Muhyid­din con­vened a spe­cial Cabi­net meet­ing yes­ter­day morn­ing which agreed that the gov­ern­ment should ad­vise the King to de­clare a state of emer­gency.</p>
    <p>“An emer­gency procla­ma­tion would of­fer tem­po­rary relief from the po­lit­i­cal chaos that could arise from Muhyid­din po­ten­tially los­ing a bud­get vote in Par­lia­ment,” po­lit­i­cal risk con­sul­tancy Eura­sia Group’s Asia direc­tor Peter Mum­ford told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>A dec­la­ra­tion of emer­gency would al­low the sit­ting gov­ern­ment to en­act laws and ap­prove ex­pen­di­ture with­out a par­lia­men­tary vote.</p>
    <p>This would mean the Muhyid­din ad­min­is­tra­tion would be able to op­er­ate well into next year with­out need­ing Par­lia­ment to give the green light for its spend­ing for the year.</p>
    <p>Yet, de­spite an au­di­ence with the King last­ing more than two hours, Mr Muhyid­din’s en­tourage, which in­cluded se­nior Cabi­net min­is­ters and gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials, failed to gain im­me­di­ate royal as­sent for a procla­ma­tion of emer­gency, ST un­der­stands.</p>
    <p>Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah’s hes­i­ta­tion is un­der­stand­able, as the only pre­vi­ous na­tional emer­gency was de­clared af­ter the vi­o­lent race ri­ots of 1969. Malaysia faces no such threat to­day, aside from an es­ca­lat­ing num­ber of Covid-19 cases and deaths.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, as op­po­si­tion lead­ers have claimed, ex­ist­ing leg­is­la­tion al­ready al­lows the gov­ern­ment to im­pose stay-home or­ders and move­ment curbs for the pan­demic, with­out the need for an emer­gency that al­lows the ex­ec­u­tive arm of gov­ern­ment to sus­pend Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>It is un­der­stood that the King wants to con­sult the eight other state mon­archs be­fore de­cid­ing on the emer­gency re­quest. This is not dis­sim­i­lar to when he con­ferred with his brother rulers in Fe­bru­ary be­fore in­stalling Mr Muhyid­din as prime min­is­ter fol­low­ing a week-long cri­sis that re­sulted in the col­lapse of the Pakatan Hara­pan gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The Pre­mier is tread­ing an un­prece­dented path. Al­ready, there is public shock and anger at what is per­ceived as noth­ing more than a po­lit­i­cal ma­noeu­vre to stay in power.</p>
    <p>But time is Mr Muhyid­din’s</p>
    <p>friend. In­cum­bency means he may yet sway MPs to his side be­fore sub­ject­ing him­self to a Par­lia­ment vote, or in­deed wait un­til con­di­tions are right – with Covid-19 in­fec­tions un­der con­trol – to de­clare a gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
