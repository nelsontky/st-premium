    <p>as an MP, and as mayor of North East Dis­trict.</p>
    <p>He re­called that he be­came mayor in 2009, amid a re­ces­sion, and worked on cre­at­ing a net­work of job place­ment cen­tres across the dis­trict.</p>
    <p>He said tem­po­rary po­si­tions were cre­ated within the com­mu­nity for job seek­ers to main­tain an in­come while look­ing for more per­ma­nent jobs – a sys­tem that is still rel­e­vant in to­day’s tough economic times caused by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Be­fore join­ing pol­i­tics, Mr Teo was in the pri­vate sec­tor – he had spent a decade in lo­gis­tics and was gen­eral man­ager at DHL Ex­press.</p>
    <p>In pol­i­tics, he said, he found joy in “in­no­vat­ing through pro­grammes, cre­at­ing them and then im­ple­ment­ing them to solve prob­lems” raised by res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>That was how he came to cre­ate ded­i­cated study and work­ing spa­ces in Sengkang Com­mu­nity Club for res­i­dents to use, com­plete with fa­cil­i­ties such as pho­to­copiers and free snacks.</p>
    <p>Last month, Mr Teo found that Sengkang Com­mu­nity Club had be­come a pop­u­lar rest point for food de­liv­ery riders, given the uptick in or­ders and its prox­im­ity to Com­pass One and Ko­pi­tiam Square.</p>
    <p>He thus re­quested that Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion staff draw ad­di­tional mo­tor­bike park­ing spa­ces and in­stall benches for riders to use.</p>
    <p>Th­ese fa­cil­i­ties have proven pop­u­lar. When Mr Teo made a Face­book post call­ing on res­i­dents to sup­port the PAP’s Sengkang GRC team on the fi­nal day of the GE2020 cam­paign, a num­ber of res­i­dents thanked him for pro­vid­ing con­ducive spa­ces for stu­dents to study.</p>
    <p>The new Sengkang GRC – which the Work­ers’ Party won in the elec­tion – ab­sorbed his Sengkang Cen­tral ward, as well as parts of Sengkang West and Pung­gol East.</p>
    <p>While Mr Teo de­clined to talk about his suc­ces­sors, he said his cen­tral rule as an MP was to al­ways be ac­ces­si­ble to his res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>He said: “You must make sure you have a sys­tem for them to ac­cess you and the peo­ple work­ing to­gether with you, and you also need to reach out to them too – it goes both ways.</p>
    <p>“At any point in time, there must be that trust and con­fi­dence that this per­son, he’ll be there, and even if they don’t see you, they feel you.”</p>
