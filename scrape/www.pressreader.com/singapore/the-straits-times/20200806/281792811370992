    <p>The mas­sive blast in the Le­banese cap­i­tal of Beirut was so huge that it rat­tled trees and win­dows in Cyprus, 240km away across the Mediter­ranean Sea.</p>
    <p>The gov­er­nor of the Le­banese cap­i­tal likened that ex­plo­sion to the nu­clear bomb dropped on the Ja­panese city of Hiroshima ex­actly 75 years ago to­day.</p>
    <p>Yet it would be the po­lit­i­cal af­ter­shocks from this ex­plo­sive tragedy which will count for much more.</p>
    <p>The coun­try which used to be fa­mous as the Mid­dle East’s most di­verse and sophistica­ted Arab na­tion is al­ready en­dur­ing an eco­nomic cri­sis, fu­elled by what is widely per­ceived to be an in­com­pe­tent po­lit­i­cal struc­ture.</p>
    <p>The Le­banese pound, the na­tional cur­rency once pegged to the US dol­lar, has halved in value this year alone, throw­ing an es­ti­mated third of the pop­u­la­tion out of work.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment also faces one of the high­est debt bur­dens in the world, ap­proach­ing 170 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct; Le­banon de­faulted on its debt re­pay­ments ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>And if this was not enough, the na­tion is en­gulfed by strife: to the north and east lies war-torn Syria, and to the south is Is­rael, where a mil­i­tary flare-up is pre­dicted on a daily ba­sis, as Is­raeli forces mass against Hizbol­lah, the Ira­nian-funded and sup­ported Shi’ite mili­tia.</p>
    <p>The lat­est dis­as­ter not only deep­ens Le­banon’s eco­nomic re­ces­sion; it also com­pletely takes out of ac­tion Beirut’s port, through which most of the coun­try’s crit­i­cal food im­ports flow.</p>
    <p>If al­ter­na­tive sup­plies and trans­port routes are not found im­me­di­ately, food short­ages are in­evitable as early as next week.</p>
    <p>The only sil­ver lin­ing in this tragedy is that the dev­as­ta­tion has now drawn world at­ten­tion to Le­banon’s dire eco­nomic plight.</p>
    <p>In May, the coun­try launched ne­go­ti­a­tions with the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund, but the talks quickly stalled be­cause the IMF de­manded painful eco­nomic re­forms.</p>
    <p>In a coun­try deeply di­vided be­tween Chris­tians and Mus­lims and be­tween Sunni and Shi’ite Arabs, the au­thor­i­ties found it im­pos­si­ble to ap­ply the re­forms which are most needed – a cut in the mas­sive food and utility sub­si­dies which are both un­sus­tain­able and dis­tort lo­cal mar­kets.</p>
    <p>This im­passe now looks likely to be bro­ken by the dis­as­ter, with both in­di­vid­ual donor na­tions and the IMF of­fer­ing help.</p>
    <p>France, the old colo­nial power, is tak­ing the lead in this en­gage­ment.</p>
    <p>“I ex­press my fra­ter­nal sol­i­dar­ity with the Le­banese,” said French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron im­me­di­ately af­ter the tragedy. French aid and food re­sources have al­ready been air­lifted, and Mr Macron is fly­ing to Beirut to­day to per­son­ally as­sess the dam­age and the aid re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>It is also very likely that the United States will drop its veto on new IMF fund­ing, which could mean that Le­banon may avoid fi­nan­cial melt­down.</p>
    <p>But the real ques­tion is whether hu­man­i­tar­ian help would be enough to stave off the com­ing po­lit­i­cal cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Foul play for the ex­plo­sions can­not be ex­cluded; Beirut’s port is also a crit­i­cal route for the smug­gling of arms and other il­le­gal goods.</p>
    <p>But an ac­ci­dent – the cur­rent of­fi­cial ex­pla­na­tion – re­mains very plau­si­ble as well.</p>
    <p>Still, what­ever the causes of the ex­plo­sions may be, it is al­ready ob­vi­ous that the tragedy is a clas­sic ex­am­ple of the con­se­quences of Le­banon’s dys­func­tional ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>The cause of the sec­ondary and most dev­as­tat­ing ex­plo­sion is re­ported to have been a huge store of am­mo­nium ni­trate that had been seized by the Beirut port au­thor­i­ties from a ship back in Septem­ber 2013.</p>
    <p>Why would any­one leave such highly ex­plo­sive ma­te­rial in such large quan­ti­ties in the cen­tre of the cap­i­tal’s port for years? Cor­rup­tion, in­com­pe­tence or ac­tive col­lu­sion with one of Le­banon’s mili­tias are the most likely ex­pla­na­tions.</p>
    <p>“I prom­ise you that this catas­tro­phe will not pass with­out ac­count­abil­ity,” Le­banon’s Prime Min­is­ter Has­san Diab said.</p>
    <p>It is a pledge few in Le­banon take se­ri­ously.</p>
    <p>And it is al­most cer­tain that Hizbol­lah, by far the most po­tent and dis­ci­plined mili­tia in the coun­try, will seek to cap­i­talise on the tragedy by tight­en­ing its con­trol over a de­mor­alised Le­banese gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>For the mo­ment, Hizbol­lah is try­ing to sound keen only on en­sur­ing good gov­er­nance – “Re­spon­si­bil­ity must be as­signed over what hap­pened at Beirut Port,” de­manded politi­cian Amine Cherri, a Hizbol­lah mem­ber of the Le­banese Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>How­ever, all eyes will be on Hizbol­lah leader Has­san Nas­ral­lah, who plans to make a ma­jor speech af­ter the of­fi­cial pe­riod of mourn­ing for those killed in the blasts.</p>
    <p>That will be the mo­ment when the Le­banese will learn whether their tragedy could usher in a more united na­tion or whether it amounts to just an­other step in the long march to na­tional dis­in­te­gra­tion.</p>
