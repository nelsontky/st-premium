    <p>MADRID • The Madrid Open, one of the premier tournament­s of the clay-court swing, yes­ter­day fell vic­tim to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the lat­est in a string of high-pro­file ten­nis events to be can­celled.</p>
    <p>The joint ATP and WTA event was ini­tially due to take place from May 1-10, but was pushed back to</p>
    <p>Sept 14-20 be­cause of the Covid-19 cri­sis. But with Spain ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions, par­tic­u­larly in Madrid, or­gan­is­ers de­cided to call off the tour­na­ment al­to­gether.</p>
    <p>A state­ment read: “As an act of re­spon­si­bil­ity in view of the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion caused by Covid-19 and hav­ing thor­oughly eval­u­ated the cir­cum­stances that the pan­demic con­tin­ues to gen­er­ate... it has been de­cided that 2020 Madrid Open will not take place this year.”</p>
    <p>World No. 56 and tour­na­ment di­rec­tor Feli­ciano Lopez said: “Af­ter the first can­cel­la­tion in May, we got to work on the Septem­ber date with the hope of be­ing able to en­joy first­class ten­nis dur­ing this year which has been so hard for ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, the con­tin­ued in­sta­bil­ity is still too great to hold a tour­na­ment like this in com­plete safety.”</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers added that next year’s edi­tion will take place from April 30 to May 9.</p>
    <p>While prepa­ra­tions for the French Open, which starts on Sept 27, will now un­doubt­edly be af­fected with the ax­ing of the Madrid Open, the US Open is set to be the ben­e­fi­ciary.</p>
    <p>It was ini­tially widely re­ported a num­ber of play­ers had been sit­ting on the fence due to the hard-court Grand Slam co­in­cid­ing so closely with the start of the clay-court swing. But with a week’s gap be­tween the end of the US Open on Sept 13 and the start of the Rome Mas­ters, which is sched­uled for</p>
    <p>Sept 20-27, this is likely to mean more Euro­pean play­ers may fea­ture at Flush­ing Mead­ows.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a tweet by New York Times’ ten­nis cor­re­spon­dent Christo­pher Clarey, de­fend­ing US Open cham­pion Rafael Nadal and world No. 2 Si­mona Halep have de­cided to re­main on the Slam’s en­try list, with any with­drawal to hap­pen much closer to the tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>Wim­ble­don, the WTA Fi­nals and the Shang­hai Mas­ters have all been can­celled be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
