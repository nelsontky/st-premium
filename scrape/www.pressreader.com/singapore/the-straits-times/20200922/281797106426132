    <p>WELLING­TON • New Zealand Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern has lifted all coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions across the coun­try, ex­cept in sec­ond-wave hot spot Auck­land, as the num­ber of new in­fec­tions slowed to a trickle.</p>
    <p>Some re­stric­tions were also eased in Auck­land to al­low gath­er­ings of up to 100 peo­ple, but the coun­try’s biggest city needed more time be­fore all curbs could be lifted, Ms Ardern said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Our ac­tions col­lec­tively have man­aged to get the virus un­der con­trol,” she told re­porters in Auck­land. “This was the cen­tre of the out­break and that’s why that cau­tion is needed here.”</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion means that mass gath­er­ings, such as the first Bledis­loe Cup rugby test match be­tween the All Blacks and Aus­tralia in Welling­ton on Oct 11, can pro­ceed with­out re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>New Zealand, a na­tion of five mil­lion, ap­peared to have halted community trans­mis­sion of Covid-19 ear­lier this year, but a fresh out­break in Auck­land last month prompted the gov­ern­ment to place the city back in lock­down.</p>
    <p>The coun­try had no new cases of Covid-19 yes­ter­day, keep­ing its to­tal num­ber of con­firmed cases at 1,464, with 25 deaths, far be­low the num­ber in many other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern, who faces a gen­eral elec­tion on Oct 17, said a health min­istry anal­y­sis in­di­cated there was still only a 50-50 chance of hav­ing elim­i­nated Covid-19 by the end of the month, main­tain­ing the need for vig­i­lance.</p>
    <p>But she said Auck­land “needs more time” to elim­i­nate a stub­born clus­ter of in­fec­tions that was de­tected last month in the city of 1.5 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>“This was the cen­tre of the out­break and that’s why cau­tion is re­quired here,” she said.</p>
    <p>The ori­gin of the Auck­land clus­ter re­mains un­known, but the health au­thor­i­ties say it is not the same strain of the virus ex­pe­ri­enced ear­lier this year. De­spite the mys­tery, Ms Ardern said ex­ten­sive test­ing and ef­fec­tive con­tact trac­ing were keep­ing it con­tained.</p>
    <p>The city’s virus set­ting will be re­viewed in two weeks, with the pos­si­bil­ity it could join the rest of the coun­try at level one on Oct 7.</p>
    <p>The 40-year-old Prime Min­is­ter has a strong lead over her ri­vals in the polls due to her suc­cess in con­tain­ing Covid-19.</p>
    <p>She was crit­i­cised, how­ever, by op­po­si­tion Na­tional Party leader Ju­dith Collins yes­ter­day for tak­ing a group selfie with sup­port­ers while cam­paign­ing, with­out main­tain­ing so­cial dis­tance.</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern ac­knowl­edged it was a mis­take, say­ing: “I should have stepped fur­ther for­ward, I should have asked them to step apart from each other, and I ac­knowl­edge that.”</p>
