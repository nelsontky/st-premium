    <p>BARCELONA • When the Cham­pi­ons League draw put Barcelona and Ju­ven­tus in the same group, foot­ball fans rel­ished the prospect of watch­ing Lionel Messi face Cris­tiano Ron­aldo again.</p>
    <p>The two had not played against each other since Ron­aldo left Real Madrid for Ju­ven­tus in 2018.</p>
    <p>The two men were de­nied a re­union i n Turin i n Oc­to­ber, as Ron­aldo missed Barca’s 2-0 vic­tory af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>So all eyes were on the duo on Tues­day, with Ron­aldo healthy again and rar­ing to go, and it was the Por­tuguese for­ward who came out on top as Juve tri­umphed 3-0 to claim first place in Group G.</p>
    <p>A con­stant thorn in the Cata­lans’ flesh while with Real, he scored two penal­ties to take his tally against Barca to an ex­tra­or­di­nary 20 goals in 31 games.</p>
    <p>“Ron­aldo was very mo­ti­vated to put in a good per­for­mance here against his eter­nal ri­val, so when you’re that mo­ti­vated, it be­comes sim­ple,” said Juve coach An­drea Pirlo.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Ron­aldo him­self de­nied that he was more mo­ti­vated than usual, say­ing that he en­joys a “cor­dial re­la­tion­ship” with Messi.</p>
    <p>“As I have said be­fore, for 12, 13, 14 years (I have been) shar­ing prizes with him,” he told Mo­vis­tar.</p>
    <p>“I never saw him as a ri­val. He al­ways tried the best for his team, and I tried the best for mine. I al­ways got on well with him. I am sure he will say the same if you ask him. But we know in foot­ball, peo­ple al­ways look for a ri­valry to cre­ate more ex­cite­ment.”</p>
    <p>It was not j ust the goals that caught the eye. From the get-go, the 35-year-old looked much quicker than the Barca back­line de­spite their sig­nif­i­cant age dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>He even had time to help out his de­fence in the fi­nal 10 min­utes when he tracked back and dis­pos­sessed Messi in­side the Juve box be­fore l ead­ing the charge on a counter-at­tack.</p>
    <p>The Ar­gen­tinian fought valiantly in what al­ways looked to be a los­ing bat­tle, but at times he ap­peared iso­lated in a dis­jointed at­tack.</p>
    <p>He tested Juve goal­keeper Gian­luigi Buf­fon from dis­tance but never looked like scor­ing.</p>
    <p>Both sides were as­sured of qual­i­fi­ca­tion be­fore kick-off, but Juve’s three-goal vic­tory, with We­ston McKen­nie adding an­other goal, gave them a su­pe­rior head-to-head record.</p>
    <p>“We got off to a bad start, didn’t play well de­fen­sively, were lack­ing ag­gres­sion in mid­field, and Ju­ven­tus played well,” an em­bat­tled Barca coach Ronald Koe­man said. “They were par­tic­u­larly strong in the first half-hour and de­served to win.”</p>
