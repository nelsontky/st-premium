    <p>•</p>
    <p>HONG KONG Es­tab­lished Asian hedge funds have at­tracted the lion’s share of new money this year, while start-ups have been ham­strung by global travel curbs that have made face-to-face meet­ings with Euro­pean and United States as­set al­lo­ca­tors im­pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Well-known firms, in­clud­ing Tribeca In­vest­ment Part­ners, Pleiad In­vest­ment Ad­vi­sors, Dy­mon Asia Cap­i­tal (Sin­ga­pore) and Syle­bra Cap­i­tal, have drawn more than US$3 bil­lion (S$4.07 bil­lion) of new money among them this year.</p>
    <p>That con­trasts with t he net US$3.1 bil­lion that flowed out of re­gional funds i n the first eight months of this year, ac­cord­ing to data firm Eureka­hedge.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the me­dian rais­ing for new Asia funds this year is just US$20 mil­lion (S$27 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>“As­set rais­ing has been pos­si­ble this year, but it has been ma­te­ri­ally more chal­leng­ing,” said chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer Matthew White­head of Hong Kong-based Syle­bra.</p>
    <p>Among funds that have at­tracted new money, Tribeca saw as­sets swell by about US$1 bil­lion be­tween March and l ast month, half of which was new money, with the rest com­ing from per­for­mance gains, its Asia chief ex­ec­u­tive Ben Cleary said.</p>
    <p>In­vestors who had en­joyed a decade of big gains in the US dur­ing its bull run are now look­ing for other op­tions to hedge their risks as a weak­en­ing US dol­lar and econ­omy put re­turns un­der pres­sure, he said.</p>
    <p>APS As­set Man­age­ment added about US$200 mil­lion from ex­ist­ing North Amer­i­can and Euro­pean in­sti­tu­tional in­vestors, its chief in­vest­ment of­fi­cer Wong Kok Hoi said.</p>
    <p>He added that China’s rel­a­tively quick con­tain­ment of the coro­n­avirus out­break and rapid eco­nomic re­bound have boosted its at­trac­tive­ness for in­vestors.</p>
    <p>Syle­bra raised about US$400 mil­lion for a new tech­nol­ogy-fo­cused fund.</p>
    <p>With a short­age of lo­cal in­sti­tu­tional al­lo­ca­tors to hedge funds, Asian man­agers rely on US and Euro­pean sov­er­eign wealth funds, univer­sity en­dow­ments, char­i­ta­ble foun­da­tions and pen­sions for stick­ier money. That makes them par­tic­u­larly vul­ner­a­ble to the Covid-19 travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>About 73 per cent of in­vestors in a re­cent Credit Suisse Group sur­vey an­tic­i­pated no travel for the rest of the year to re­search and con­duct due dili­gence on hedge funds.</p>
    <p>Just 30 per cent of them are able to in­vest with­out on-site vis­its. An additional 42 per cent could al­lo­cate money with­out face-to-face meet­ings only if cer­tain con­di­tions are met, such as fa­mil­iar­ity with the in­vest­ment team.</p>
    <p>The new money tends to con­cen­trate in two groups of man­agers: those who have a proven track record of per­for­mance, and the so­called plat­forms whose mul­ti­tude of in­vest­ment teams en­ables them to gen­er­ate sta­ble re­turns.</p>
    <p>Dy­mon, which is re­turn­ing money from its flag­ship macro fund to fo­cus on a multi-strat­egy fund, has gath­ered US$1.6 bil­lion for the new fund and ex­pects a fur­ther US$1 bil­lion in the com­ing months, the firm said last month.</p>
    <p>New of­fer­ings also give in­vestors an op­por­tu­nity to gain ac­cess to, or top up money with, star man­agers who have re­stricted in­flows into older funds.</p>
    <p>Some firms have started, or plan to set up, funds that place only bullish bets, as short-sell­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties in the re­gion are rel­a­tively lim­ited. These funds are not cap­tured in the Eureka­hedge data.</p>
    <p>Pleiad, for in­stance, has raised al­most US$500 mil­lion for an Asia long-only fund, mostly new money that came in this year, said a per­son with knowl­edge of the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang Tong­shu’s WT As­set Man­age­ment gath­ered about US$200 mil­lion in two months for a new long-only fund that fo­cuses on</p>
    <p>Greater China stocks, with a sov­er­eign wealth fund as an­chor in­vestor, said chief ex­ec­u­tive Vi­vian Chang.</p>
    <p>Ana­tole raised about US$100 mil­lion for a new long-only fund in two months, said a per­son with knowl­edge of the mat­ter. Its older US$2 bil­lion flag­ship fund re­turned more than 60 per cent in the first eight months, while a sec­ond fund gained more than 80 per cent.</p>
    <p>New and ex­ist­ing in­vestors com­mit­ted US$50 mil­lion to a new long-only Asia fund started by Zaaba Cap­i­tal, ac­cord­ing to chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer Michael Becker.</p>
    <p>More are in the pipe­line. CloudAl­pha Cap­i­tal Man­age­ment, whose fund re­turned 135 per cent in the first eight months of the year, is start­ing a new fund that takes more con­cen­trated long and short bets on global tech stocks.</p>
    <p>“In this cur­rent phase, in­vestors will be mak­ing fewer in­vest­ments, ini­tial in­vest­ment sizes will be smaller and will build slowly,” Mr White­head said.</p>
    <p>The new money tends to con­cen­trate in two groups of man­agers: those who have a proven track record of per­for­mance, and the so-called plat­forms whose mul­ti­tude of in­vest­ment teams en­ables them to gen­er­ate sta­ble re­turns.</p>
