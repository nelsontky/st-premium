    <p>Mu­sic mogul Si­mon Cow­ell has un­der­gone surgery af­ter break­ing his back in a fall from an elec­tric bike in Cal­i­for­nia last week.</p>
    <p>Last Saturday, his spokesman said: “Si­mon had a fall from his bike, test­ing his new elec­tric bike in the court­yard at his house in Mal­ibu with his fam­ily. He hurt his back and was taken to hospi­tal. He’s do­ing fine, he’s un­der ob­ser­va­tion and is in the best pos­si­ble hands.”</p>
    <p>The English­man lives in the United States with his part­ner Lau­ren Sil­ver­man and six-year-old son Eric.</p>
    <p>In an In­sta­gram post yes­ter­day, the 60-year-old wrote: “Some good ad­vice... If you buy an elec­tric trail bike, read the man­ual be­fore you ride it for the first time.”</p>
    <p>He thanked ev­ery­one for their kind mes­sages and the med­i­cal team in­volved in his care.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tain’s Got Tal­ent, Amer­i­can Idol and X Fac­tor judge was set to re­turn to his re­al­ity-tele­vi­sion show, Amer­ica’s Got Tal­ent, with the first live show to air to­day.</p>
    <p>The show’s net­work NBC said he will not ap­pear in the sea­son’s first episodes, sched­uled for Tues­day and Wed­nes­day in the US.</p>
    <p>His fel­low judges – su­per­model Heidi Klum, ac­tress Sofia Ver­gara and co­me­dian Howie Man­del – sent him mes­sages of sup­port.</p>
    <p>“Wish­ing you a speedy re­cov­ery @si­mon­cow­ell,” Klum wrote. She posted a photo of her­self, Ver­gara and Man­del – so­cially dis­tanced – with a seat left empty for Cow­ell.</p>
    <p>Ver­gara posted the same pic­ture, writ­ing: “We miss our boss. Come back fast @si­mon­cow­ell.”</p>
    <p>In 2017, Cow­ell fell down the stairs at his London home and was taken to the hospi­tal by paramedics.</p>
    <p>“They think I fainted be­cause I had low blood pres­sure and so I have got to re­ally take good care of my­self to sort that out,” he told The Sun tabloid at the time.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter all, I am a dad and have more re­spon­si­bil­ity than ever.”</p>
