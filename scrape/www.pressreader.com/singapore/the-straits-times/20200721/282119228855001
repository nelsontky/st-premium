    <p>Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity law pro­fes­sor Chan Wing Cheong brought up a sen­si­ble pro­posal rec­om­mended by the Gov­ern­ment in 1979 – di­vorce by mu­tual agree­ment (Con­sider al­low­ing no-fault di­vorce to re­move blame game when cou­ples split, July 9).</p>
    <p>The Se­lect Com­mit­tee set up to con­sider the leg­is­la­tion did not agree, so the pro­posal was dropped, to the detri­ment of cou­ples hav­ing to en­dure a painful ad­ver­sar­ial le­gal process be­fore con­clud­ing their di­vorce.</p>
    <p>Ms Kang Zhi Ni ar­gues that di­vorce laws should make it ar­du­ous for cou­ples to ter­mi­nate their mar­riage, to en­cour­age them to first make an ef­fort to over­come their dif­fer­ences (‘No-fault’ di­vorce threat­ens fab­ric of fam­i­lies, ex­poses chil­dren to vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties, July 15). This ra­tio­nale de­serves fur­ther scru­tiny.</p>
    <p>In the case of adul­tery, fam­ily vi­o­lence, com­pul­sive gam­bling, ex­ces­sive drink­ing or im­pru­dent ne­glect of fi­nan­cial main­te­nance, grant­ing the suf­fer­ing spouse an ef­fec­tive way out is hu­man­i­tar­ian and im­per­a­tive to the safety and well-be­ing of the chil­dren in­volved.</p>
    <p>Those versed in fam­ily vi­o­lence know that abusers con­ceal their traits in the early days and vic­tims risk jeop­ar­dis­ing their safety by speak­ing up. Man­dat­ing the need to in­di­cate faults puts such in­di­vid­u­als at risk and in­creases ac­ri­mony between cou­ples while di­min­ish­ing their abil­ity to co-par­ent.</p>
    <p>Di­vorc­ing par­ents en­snared in a pro­tracted le­gal process, by way of a sys­tem en­dors­ing in­ces­sant as­ser­tions and counter-as­ser­tions, are forced to di­rect re­sources that would bet­ter serve the chil­dren to­wards ex­or­bi­tant at­tor­ney and court fees.</p>
    <p>While it is un­cer­tain that no-fault leg­is­la­tion will trans­late to higher di­vorce rates, com­pelling fault to be estab­lished leads to more con­tested di­vorces. Per­mit­ting no-fault di­vorce along­side me­di­a­tion, how­ever, en­hances ef­fi­ciency for con­sen­sual pe­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>It is puerile to im­ply di­vorcees have spurned the sanc­tity of mar­riages. In­di­vid­u­als should be al­lowed to re­or­gan­ise rather than en­dure un­vi­able and toxic re­la­tion­ships.</p>
    <p>Al­le­vi­at­ing le­gal re­stric­tions can ease tran­si­tions out of volatile mar­riages into sta­ble ones, and suc­cess­ful re­mar­riages and blended fam­i­lies prove such re­arrange­ments should not be dis­cred­ited as en­dan­ger­ing the fam­ily fab­ric.</p>
    <p>Di­vorced peo­ple are stig­ma­tised partly be­cause our laws have lagged. It is il­lu­sory to think we are solv­ing the di­vorce prob­lem by mak­ing it a Her­culean task.</p>
    <p>Di­vorce laws af­fect the lives of many and should not be dic­tated by parochial lens. A broader con­sul­ta­tion is needed to en­sure that the voices of those who are most af­fected are heard.</p>
