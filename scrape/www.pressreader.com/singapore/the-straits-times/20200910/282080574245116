    <p>Geospa­tial tech­nol­ogy (or lo­ca­tion-based data tech) is more cru­cial than ever amid the pan­demic, as it can be used to help con­tain the spread of Covid-19 through so­lu­tions such as crowd man­age­ment ap­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>This sen­ti­ment was shared by sev­eral speak­ers at the vir­tual launch of Sin­ga­pore Geospa­tial Week+ yes­ter­day, an event pro­mot­ing the im­por­tance and growth of geospa­tial tech­nol­ogy in Sin­ga­pore and be­yond.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Land Author­ity (SLA) act­ing chief ex­ec­u­tive Si­mon Ong said: “The im­por­tance of geospa­tial can­not be em­pha­sised more, es­pe­cially in to­day’s en­vi­ron­ment.”</p>
    <p>Other than crowd man­age­ment ap­pli­ca­tions, which al­low cit­i­zens to make in­formed choices to pro­tect them­selves when head­ing out, he noted how the tech­nol­ogy can also be used as a col­lab­o­ra­tive tool in re­sponse to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“By com­bin­ing dif­fer­ent data types and tech­nol­ogy based on lo­ca­tion, busi­nesses can un­der­stand peo­ple’s move­ment pat­terns and de­ploy the nec­es­sary re­sources to pro­tect their staff and the com­mu­nity,” he added.</p>
    <p>Smart Na­tion and Dig­i­tal Gov­ern­ment deputy sec­re­tary Tan Kok Yam de­scribed geospa­tial tech­nol­ogy as “a key ca­pa­bil­ity of a smart na­tion”.</p>
    <p>“Lo­ca­tion binds all our ac­tiv­i­ties, and un­der­stand­ing the spa­tial and tem­po­ral as­pects of these ac­tiv­i­ties is key to gain­ing aware­ness and insight to pre­dict sit­u­a­tions, re­spond to prob­lems and ad­dress chal­lenges,” he said.</p>
    <p>“There­fore, geospa­tial tech­nol­ogy and ap­proaches can help us re­spond to the pan­demic more ef­fec­tively. Dash­boards have sprouted... to en­able the au­thor­i­ties to track what’s go­ing on.”</p>
    <p>He brought up the ex­am­ple of the United States, which com­bines the use of its so­cial vul­ner­a­bil­ity in­dex – which de­ter­mines the re­silience of a com­mu­nity when faced with ex­ter­nal stresses such as a pan­demic – with pop­u­la­tion data and hos­pi­tal lo­ca­tion in­for­ma­tion, to pre­dict which com­mu­ni­ties would need more hos­pi­tal beds or health­care work­ers.</p>
    <p>But geospa­tial tech­nol­ogy is not just for the au­thor­i­ties and planners. It is also used to keep cit­i­zenry in­formed, he added.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the open datashar­ing plat­form OneMap pro­vides cit­i­zens with Covid-19-re­lated com­mu­nity in­for­ma­tion, such as where one can go to col­lect a free face mask, he said.</p>
    <p>De­vel­oped by the SLA, OneMap is a free lo­cal in­tel­li­gent map ser­vice that is reg­u­larly up­dated with in­for­ma­tion con­trib­uted by gov­ern­ment agen­cies.</p>
    <p>Next week will see the launch of the beta ver­sion of OneMap3D, a three-di­men­sional up­grade of the sys­tem which uses 3D mod­els and ren­der­ings to project how build­ings look in a neigh­bour­hood, even for build­ings that are not yet con­structed.</p>
