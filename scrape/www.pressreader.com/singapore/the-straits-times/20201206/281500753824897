    <p>Malaysians liv­ing un­der the Con­di­tional Move­ment Con­trol Or­der (CMCO) in some states will en­joy bet­ter mo­bil­ity as the coun­try lifts the curbs on their states to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>The move­ment re­stric­tions will, how­ever, be ex­tended un­til Dec 20 in Kuala Lumpur, Sabah state and six of the nine Se­lan­gor dis­tricts, where coro­n­avirus cases re­main high. Parts of Negeri Sem­bi­lan and Jo­hor states will also re­main un­der the CMCO.</p>
    <p>Malaysia will lift move­ment curbs for most states from to­mor­row, a Cab­i­net min­is­ter an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>But the par­tial lock­downs, called Con­di­tional Move­ment Con­trol Or­der (CMCO), will be ex­tended to Dec 20 for its cap­i­tal city Kuala Lumpur, the state of Sabah and six of the nine Se­lan­gor dis­tricts as coro­n­avirus cases re­main high in these ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Parts of Negeri Sem­bi­lan and Jo­hor states will also re­main un­der the CMCO, said Se­nior Min­is­ter (Se­cu­rity clus­ter) Is­mail Sabri Yaakob.</p>
    <p>He also said that from to­mor­row, in­ter­state travel will be al­lowed and all po­lice road­blocks will be re­moved.</p>
    <p>Only ar­eas un­der full lock­downs, called En­hanced MCO (EMCO) – such as those sur­round­ing Top Glove fac­to­ries and dor­mi­to­ries – will be off-lim­its to the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>The ar­eas un­der the EMCO have barbed wire fenc­ing in­stalled around them to quar­an­tine res­i­dents and al­low health work­ers to con­duct health screen­ings.</p>
    <p>Most Malaysian states, along with the fed­eral ter­ri­to­ries of KL, Putrajaya and Labuan, were placed un­der CMCO from Oc­to­ber on­wards, as the coun­try bat­tles its third wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The curbs on Putrajaya and Labuan have been lifted.</p>
    <p>Mr Is­mail said in a tele­vised ad­dress yes­ter­day that the widespread curbs have had a heavy eco­nomic toll. “Yes­ter­day, I read on so­cial me­dia that many are ask­ing what will hap­pen to­mor­row since the CMCO is ex­pected to end,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment un­der­stands how hard the sit­u­a­tion can be. Whether we like it or not, we have to move for­ward with our lives.</p>
    <p>“We stand to lose RM300 mil­lion (S$98.3 mil­lion) a day if the CMCO is ex­tended… there will be more job losses and so on. Due to that, we need to be care­ful when tak­ing care of the peo­ple and also the econ­omy,” he added.</p>
    <p>Un­der the CMCO, while most eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties were al­lowed to con­tinue, only three peo­ple per house­hold could ven­ture out of their homes.</p>
    <p>In­ter-state travel was banned ex­cept for work and emer­gen­cies.</p>
    <p>Schools and en­ter­tain­ment out­lets were shut dur­ing the CMCO, while op­er­at­ing hours of eater­ies, sundry shops and con­ve­nience stores were re­stricted to be­tween 6am and 10pm.</p>
    <p>Se­lan­gor and Kuala Lumpur have been un­der the CMCO since Oct 14 as Covid-19 cases surged, partly caused by the in­fec­tions at Top Glove, the world’s big­gest maker of la­tex gloves, and at two KL con­struc­tion sites.</p>
    <p>Sabah and Labuan have been placed un­der a sim­i­lar or­der since Oct 13 and Oct 17.</p>
    <p>The CMCO for Perak, Pe­nang and Negeri Sem­bi­lan was im­posed from Nov 9, while Ke­lan­tan’s was en­forced on Nov 21.</p>
    <p>Malaysia yes­ter­day re­ported 1,123 new Covid-19 cases, tak­ing the to­tal to 71,359. The daily in­fec­tions have mostly re­mained above 1,000 a day since Nov 1. The num­ber of fa­tal­i­ties yes­ter­day stood at 380, with the ad­di­tion of four new deaths.</p>
    <p>MOV­ING FOR­WARD</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment un­der­stands how hard the sit­u­a­tion can be. Whether we like it or not, we have to move for­ward with our lives... We stand to lose RM300 mil­lion (S$98.3 mil­lion) a day if the CMCO is ex­tended… ’’</p>
    <p>SE­NIOR MIN­IS­TER (SE­CU­RITY CLUS­TER) IS­MAIL SABRI YAAKOB, on the need to take care of the peo­ple and the econ­omy.</p>

        <p data-role="text">The usu&#xAD;ally crowded Ser&#xAD;ambi Terun&#xAD;tum com&#xAD;plex in Pa&#xAD;hang has lost its crowds. This is the case in many parts of Malaysia where some shop own&#xAD;ers have had to close down their busi&#xAD;nesses, due to the lack of cus&#xAD;tomers and rev&#xAD;enue amid the coro&#xAD;n&#xAD;avirus pan&#xAD;demic.</p>
