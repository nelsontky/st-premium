    <p>Em­ploy­ers have been urged to reg­is­ter work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries, among oth­ers, for ros­tered rou­tine test­ing, with 102,000 work­ers yet to be sched­uled for their swabs de­spite just two weeks left to take the test.</p>
    <p>The Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Author­ity (BCA) yes­ter­day said it has re­voked the ap­proval for about 280 work­ers to re­sume work, for fail­ing to un­dergo ros­tered rou­tine test­ing de­spite mul­ti­ple re­minders.</p>
    <p>The test­ing is part of mea­sures an­nounced ear­lier this month to en­sure the safe restart of work for those deemed to be at higher risk of in­fec­tion, such as those in the con­struc­tion, marine and process sec­tors, said the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM), which yes­ter­day an­nounced that it has formed a new divi­sion to take over the man­age­ment of Covid-19 at dor­mi­to­ries from the in­ter-agency task force.</p>
    <p>The task force was set up in Jan­uary to tackle the coro­n­avirus out­break here. To curb the spread in the dorms, it had since April de­ployed over 170 for­ward as­sur­ance and sup­port teams (Fast) to look after work­ers, which in­cludes test­ing them and iso­lat­ing those who have been in­fected with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The new As­sur­ance, Care and En­gage­ment (Ace) Group, which will be fully op­er­a­tional by Oct 1, will take over the de­ploy­ment of such teams at all pur­pose-built dor­mi­to­ries, fac­tory-con­verted dor­mi­to­ries, con­struc­tion tem­po­rary quar­ters and pri­vate res­i­den­tial premises, said MOM.</p>
    <p>The Ace Group will also im­ple­ment a net­work of 12 on-site med­i­cal cen­tres and sec­toral med­i­cal cen­tres to con­tinue pro­vid­ing work­ers close ac­cess to med­i­cal ser­vices as the re­gional health clus­ters, such as the Na­tional Health­care Group and SingHealth, phase out their de­ploy­ment at the dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>The move to have the new divi­sion take over dorm op­er­a­tions from the in­ter-agency task force comes after dor­mi­to­ries is­land­wide were cleared of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>On Aug 7, all mi­grant work­ers in dorms had been tested and cleared of Covid-19 ex­cept 17 stand­alone blocks in pur­pose-built dorms be­ing used as quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties. These dorms were fully cleared last Wednes­day.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment is now look­ing to pre­vent a new wave of in­fec­tions in the dorms, us­ing a range of strate­gies in­clud­ing safe liv­ing guide­lines to pre­vent the spread of the virus, and ros­tered rou­tine test­ing to de­tect in­fec­tions quickly.</p>
    <p>In a joint state­ment with BCA, the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board and the Health Pro­mo­tion Board, MOM warned that work­ers who have not un­der­gone a swab test in the pre­vi­ous fort­night by Sept 5 will re­ceive a Red Ac­cessCode and may not be able to re­turn to work. The test­ing re­quire­ment cov­ers work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries and those work­ing in the con­struc­tion as well as marine and process sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Per­son­nel who go into work­sites are also re­quired to be tested every two weeks. There are about 387,000 for­eign work­ers em­ployed in the con­struc­tion, marine and process sec­tors in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>About 16,000 em­ploy­ers – or 82 per cent – have logged onto the ros­tered rou­tine test­ing sys­tem to sched­ule their work­ers for test­ing as of yes­ter­day, up from about 15,000 last week.</p>
    <p>Ms Deb­bie Fordyce, pres­i­dent of Tran­sient Work­ers Count Too, said some em­ploy­ers could have found the process of sign­ing work­ers up for the tests com­pli­cated or time­con­sum­ing. For in­stance, they may have trou­ble fig­ur­ing out which work­ers are re­quired to go for swab test­ing, or might find it dif­fi­cult to make trans­port ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing extra ve­hi­cles and driv­ers to ferry men for ros­tered rou­tine test­ing could be dif­fi­cult, es­pe­cially for smaller com­pa­nies, as they would al­ready be stretched with get­ting work­ers back to work and mak­ing ar­range­ments to carry out projects,” she added.</p>
