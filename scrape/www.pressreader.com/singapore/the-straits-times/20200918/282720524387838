    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Let go of a per­sonal is­sue for the day. Things are not look­ing good for some­one close to you and his needs have to come first.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>You are hav­ing more fun than usual at work. If you are be­tween jobs, you may get a lead that looks promis­ing. Go for it.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Your love life ra­di­ates with great en­ergy. Whether you are sin­gle or cou­pled, your ro­man­tic con­nec­tions give you more sat­is­fac­tion.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Fo­cus on part­ner­ship. That could mean ro­mance, but it is just as likely to in­volve work or friend­ship. Do what you can to change things.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>How much in­flu­ence does tech­nol­ogy have over you? To­day is great for bring­ing a new gad­get into your life. Think of it as a new toy.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>You are feel­ing in­de­ci­sive, so make sure that you are deal­ing with things ra­tio­nally. De­fer big choices for a few days.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Your en­ergy lev­els are star­tlingly high. You can get quite a bit done, but you may need to kick back and en­joy life.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Turn in­wards and con­sider what it is that you want – you may be sur­prised. A thought­ful ques­tion may keep you fo­cused on the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21) Work be­comes en­ter­tain­ing once you tune in to the good en­ergy flow­ing through you. Drudgery be­comes some­thing you en­joy.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>You are fac­ing some big chal­lenges, so make sure you have the time to face them and give them the en­ergy that they de­serve.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Your great men­tal en­ergy should help you look at life from a wildly dif­fer­ently per­spec­tive. Seek ad­vice when you have seen enough.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>You need to deal with a cash-flow is­sue that may cause prob­lems down the line. Make sure your peo­ple agree with your so­lu­tions.</p>
