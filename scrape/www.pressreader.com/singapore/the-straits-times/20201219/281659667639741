    <p>TOKYO/MANILA • Pfizer said yes­ter­day that it had ap­plied for ap­proval in Ja­pan of its Covid-19 vac­cine, which is al­ready be­ing ad­min­is­tered in Britain and the United States.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese govern­ment has a sup­ply deal with Pfizer for 120 mil­lion doses of the vac­cine made by the US drug­maker and its German part­ner BioNTech.</p>
    <p>Pfizer said in a state­ment it had made the ap­pli­ca­tion to Ja­pan’s Health Min­istry, along with pro­vid­ing in­for­ma­tion on tests it has car­ried out up to now.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s Chief Cabi­net Sec­re­tary Kat­sunobu Kato told a news con­fer­ence prior to Pfizer’s an­nounce­ment that the vac­cine’s ef­fec­tive­ness and safety would be pri­or­i­ties.</p>
    <p>He added that Ja­pan hoped to have all of its res­i­dents vac­ci­nated in the first half of next year and that the govern­ment would make every ef­fort for proper ar­range­ments to carry this out.</p>
    <p>Tokyo raised its Covid-19 alert level to the high­est of four stages on Thurs­day as new cases spiked to a record daily high of 822.</p>
    <p>As at yes­ter­day morn­ing, Ja­pan has recorded a cu­mu­la­tive 190,921 con­firmed Covid-19 cases, with 2,661 deaths, ac­cord­ing to data com­piled by Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Philip­pines will be able to se­cure be­tween four mil­lion and 25 mil­lion doses of Covid-19 vac­cines from Moderna and Arc­turus Ther­a­peu­tics Hold­ings, the coun­try’s am­bas­sador to Wash­ing­ton said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Philip­pine Am­bas­sador Jose Manuel Ro­mualdez said in a state­ment that the US com­pa­nies were ready to sup­ply the vac­cines from the third quar­ter of next year, if his govern­ment found their pro­pos­als ac­cept­able.</p>
    <p>“We are hop­ing our govern­ment will con­sider the promis­ing candi</p>
    <p>dates of Moderna and Arc­turus for in­clu­sion in our coun­try’s pool of anti-Covid-19 vac­cines,” he said.</p>
    <p>The US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion is ex­pected to grant Moderna emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion soon. Arc­turus ex­pects to start dis­tribut­ing its vac­cine in the first quar­ter of next year af­ter early stage tri­als showed promis­ing re­sults.</p>
    <p>Moderna and Arc­turus did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>At a news con­fer­ence, Philip­pine Health Min­istry Un­der­sec­re­tary</p>
    <p>Maria Rosario Vergeire wel­comed signs of progress in the ne­go­ti­a­tions but said each vac­cine can­di­date would need to get reg­u­la­tory ap­proval to en­sure safety and ef­fi­cacy.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines plans to buy 25 mil­lion doses of a vac­cine sup­plied by China’s Si­no­vac Biotech for de­liv­ery by March. In ad­di­tion, the pri­vate sec­tor agreed last month to ac­quire 2.6 mil­lion shots of a vac­cine de­vel­oped by As­traZeneca in the na­tion’s first sup­ply deal for a coro­n­avirus vac­cine.</p>
