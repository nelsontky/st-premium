    <p>Lance Stroll yes­ter­day con­firmed he had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 af­ter the Eifel Grand Prix week­end, mak­ing him the sec­ond For­mula One driver to be in­fected this sea­son.</p>
    <p>Rac­ing Point team­mate Ser­gio Perez also re­turned a pos­i­tive test in Au­gust af­ter mak­ing a per­sonal trip to Mex­ico, caus­ing him to sub­se­quently miss both the Bri­tish Grand Prix and the fol­low­ing 70th An­niver­sary Grand Prix at Sil­ver­stone.</p>
    <p>Cana­dian Stroll with­drew from the Oct 11 Nur­bur­gring race, with Rac­ing Point boss Ot­mar Szaf­nauer then claim­ing he “could not get off the toi­let” to drive.</p>
    <p>How­ever, his pull­out has turned out to be more se­ri­ous than a case of an up­set stom­ach, espe­cially as the 21-year-old had al­ready been feel­ing un­well since the Rus­sian Grand Prix on Sept 27.</p>
    <p>The pos­i­tive di­ag­no­sis has led to crit­i­cism of gov­ern­ing body FIA’s Covid-19 test­ing pro­to­cols, which only re­quire pad­dock per­son­nel to un­dergo test­ing ev­ery five days.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Eifel race direc­tor Michael Masi yes­ter­day de­fended the mea­sures, in­sist­ing no “loop­hole” had been ex­posed.</p>
    <p>“We don’t feel there is any loop­hole,” he told Au­tosport. “The re­quire­ment for Lance, or any other at­tendee, is that there are var­i­ous time re­quire­ments to test be­fore en­ter­ing the pad­dock, and then the fol­low-up test­ing from that point.</p>
    <p>“Based on the Tues­day test, his next test would have been Sun­day morn­ing to ful­fil the re­quire­ments of the FIA Covid pro­to­col. That’s quite sim­ple.</p>
    <p>“With re­gards to Lance feel­ing ill, it’s in­cum­bent upon the driver and Rac­ing Point to de­ter­mine if they feel the driver is not up to the ca­pac­ity to drive the car, which they ob­vi­ously did.</p>
    <p>“From the re­quire­ments within Ap­pen­dix S (of the pro­to­col), it’s in­cum­bent upon Rac­ing Point as the stake­holder in this case, and Lance him­self as an at­tendee, to de­clare within the pa­ram­e­ters of the pro­to­col if they are hav­ing any of those re­quire­ments, and then there is the re­quire­ment from there to re­port.</p>
    <p>“None of that was re­ported to the FIA, so there’s noth­ing fur­ther from our per­spec­tive.”</p>
    <p>It also ap­pears that Stroll will not be ab­sent from this Sun­day’s Por­tuguese Grand Prix af­ter he con­firmed he was now in the clear.</p>
    <p>“I was tested again on Mon­day this week and my re­sults were neg­a­tive,” he tweeted yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“I feel in great shape and I can’t wait to be back with the team and to race in Por­tu­gal.”</p>
    <p>The num­ber of spec­ta­tors at the Al­garve In­ter­na­tional Cir­cuit will be cut fol­low­ing a spike in coron­avirus cases in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>While an of­fi­cial state­ment on Tues­day did not state the num­ber of at­ten­dees that will be al­lowed in, or­gan­is­ers said the coun­try’s health au­thor­i­ties had or­dered a cap on fans.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this week, Por­tu­gal broke the 100,000-case bar­rier since the on­set of the pan­demic in March.</p>
