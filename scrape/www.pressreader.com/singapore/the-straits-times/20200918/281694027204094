    <p>The world can­not wait for, or ex­pect, a vac­cine to stop the pan­demic. Peo­ple and coun­tries must work with the tools they have to­day, said many of the 16 speak­ers at the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine’s fi­nal Covid-19 we­bi­nar last night.</p>
    <p>“It is not go­ing away, we are not go­ing to erad­i­cate it in the fore­see­able fu­ture, so we have got to learn to live with it as a con­stant threat, keep­ing it at bay, stop­ping it from welling up, get­ting on with our eco­nomic and so­cial lives,” said Pro­fes­sor David Nabarro of Im­pe­rial Col­lege Lon­don.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor David Hey­mann of the Lon­don School of Hy­giene and Trop­i­cal Medicine said there is an “ex­tra­or­di­nary amount of re­search and devel­op­ment on vac­cines”. But even with a suc­cess­ful vac­cine, there is in­suf­fi­cient ca­pac­ity in the world to­day to pro­duce enough for all who need it.</p>
    <p>Many ex­perts, both lo­cal and in­ter­na­tional, also stressed the crit­i­cal need for global sol­i­dar­ity to over­come the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Dr Mar­garet Ham­burg of the Na­tional Acad­emy of Sciences, Engi­neer­ing and Medicine in the United States said: “The bio­med­i­cal re­search and health com­mu­ni­ties have come to­gether in un­prece­dented ways, across dis­ci­plines and sec­tors and bor­ders, and they have moved at un­prece­dented speed.”</p>
    <p>This, she said, gives her rea­son for op­ti­mism in the midst of the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Dr Marie-Paule Kieny of Inserm, a pub­lic sci­en­tific and tech­no­log­i­cal in­sti­tute in France, said that there is “no al­ter­na­tive to global sol­i­dar­ity, be­cause we are all there to­gether”.</p>
    <p>She said some gov­ern­ments want to be able to im­mu­nise their whole pop­u­la­tion be­fore any­body else gets the vac­cine. “I think that this is not the way to go.”</p>
    <p>She hopes, in the rush for a vac­cine, that no vac­cine would be used be­fore it is proven to be ef­fec­tive as that could lead to greater “vac­cine scep­ti­cism” and a loss of trust in chil­dren’s vac­ci­na­tion pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>Dr Howard Njoo, Canada’s deputy chief pub­lic health of­fi­cer, said no coun­try on its own will be able to beat the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 is ev­ery­where in the world, and I think the best way to beat this pan­demic is for coun­tries to learn from each other, share best prac­tices and cer­tainly I think co­op­er­ate in terms of try­ing to mit­i­gate the spread of the virus fur­ther.”</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor John Wong, a se­nior ad­viser at the Na­tional Univer­sity Health Sys­tem, said the world has to remain united and pool col­lec­tive ex­per­tise to tackle what is a global health, eco­nomic, so­cial and geopo­lit­i­cal cri­sis.</p>
    <p>He added: “Per­haps our great­est gift to our chil­dren and grand­chil­dren is to learn from this and do ev­ery­thing to prevent the next pan­demic.”</p>
