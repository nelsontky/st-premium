    <p>Drug raids have net­ted around $800,000 worth of nar­cotics, in­clud­ing more than 11kg of heroin, and 10 ar­rests. Those ar­rested were all Sin­ga­pore­ans – nine men and one woman – aged be­tween 28 and 62.</p>
    <p>Apart from the heroin, Cen­tral Nar­cotics Bureau (CNB) of­fi­cers seized 101g of metham­phetamine, also known as Ice, 30 ec­stasy tablets and frag­ments, one Erimin-5 tablet and $18,400 in cash.</p>
    <p>In one raid on Thurs­day, two CNB of­fi­cers ob­served two men in Wood­lands Av­enue 6 get­ting into a pri­vate­hire ve­hi­cle. The duo, aged 43 and 51, were ar­rested when they alighted in Wood­lands Street 13.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cers found 12 pack­ets con­tain­ing 90g of heroin and seven pack­ets with 87.5g of Ice on the 43-year-old. A search of the ve­hi­cle un­earthed 50 pack­ets con­tain­ing 375g of heroin, as well as $8,400 in cash.</p>
    <p>A reader of The Straits Times, who heard shouts from his win­dow, saw what he be­lieved to be two plain­clothes of­fi­cers try­ing to pin down a man. Pho­tos given to ST show an­other sus­pect sit­ting slumped against the wall while an­other man keeps watch over him. The two were later ar­rested.</p>
    <p>The en­tire in­ci­dent in Wood­lands Street 13 lasted about 20 min­utes. Of­fi­cers then raided the 51-year-old man’s flat in Wood­lands Av­enue 6 and found 646g of heroin and 3g of Ice in­side.</p>
    <p>An­other CNB team raided a res­i­den­tial unit in River­vale Drive that same af­ter­noon and ar­rested a 53-year-old man for drug-traf­fick­ing of­fences. Over 5kg of heroin was re­cov­ered from the unit.</p>
    <p>Two men aged 28 and 30 were also ar­rested sep­a­rately on Thurs­day, both in Teck Whye Lane. Four bun­dles con­tain­ing 1,895g of heroin were seized from a mo­tor­cy­cle be­long­ing to the 30-yearold.</p>
    <p>An­other raid re­sulted in four more Sin­ga­pore­ans ar­rested.</p>
    <p>Two of them – a 40-year-old woman and a 52-year-old man – were ap­pre­hended for sus­pected drug con­sump­tion in Choa Chu Kang Street 51 and Teck Whye Cres­cent, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cers then raided a res­i­den­tial unit in Choa Chu Kang Street 51 where a 50-year-old man sought to evade cap­ture but fell out of a win­dow. He was taken con­scious to Khoo Teck Puat Hos­pi­tal where he is in sta­ble con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>A search of the unit found 1g of heroin, three pack­ets con­tain­ing 5g of Ice, 20 ec­stasy tablets and one Erimin-5 tablet. Car keys in the unit led of­fi­cers to a rented ve­hi­cle, where four bun­dles con­tain­ing 1,904g of heroin were re­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>The raid also re­sulted in the ar­rest of a 62-year-old man in Choa Chu Kang Av­enue 1 with 6g of heroin in his pos­ses­sion while 8g was found in his ve­hi­cle.</p>
    <p>In the last raid, also on Thurs­day, a 59-year-old man was ar­rested on drug-traf­fick­ing charges.</p>
    <p>He had two bun­dles con­tain­ing 954g of heroin when stopped by CNB of­fi­cers in Chin Swee Road.</p>
    <p>The man in­jured a CNB of­fi­cer with a me­tal ob­ject while re­sist­ing ar­rest.</p>
    <p>An­other 3g of heroin, 5.5g of Ice, 10 ec­stasy tablets and frag­ments and $10,000 in cash were found in the man’s flat.</p>
    <p>The CNB said the to­tal amount of heroin seized would be enough to feed the ad­dic­tion of about 5,290 abusers for a week.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing.</p>
