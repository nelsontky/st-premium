    <p>“All the world’s a stage,” wrote Shake­speare. “And one man in his time plays many parts.”</p>
    <p>Tossed be­tween ra­pa­cious em­pires and feck­less oli­garchs through­out the cen­turies, the Philip­pines has never had any leader like Ro­drigo Duterte.</p>
    <p>Here is a man who plays a thou­sand roles at the helm of power, a con­sum­mate thes­pian crowned by a be­sieged peo­ple in their dark­est hours.</p>
    <p>And if we were to be­lieve, on face value, the lat­est sur­veys, Pres­i­dent Duterte is also the world’s most pop­u­lar leader.</p>
    <p>What is his magic?</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte is a man of many firsts, a sin­gu­lar fig­ure in our na­tion’s his­tory.</p>
    <p>Not only is he our first pres­i­dent from the long and un­justly marginalis­ed is­land of Min­danao, a land bristling with un­told ta­lent and un­tram­melled as­pi­ra­tions, but he is also the first mayor to have been cat­a­pulted straight to the pres­i­den­tial palace.</p>
    <p>In a long line of per­fumed and posh lead­ers, he proudly stands apart as the scruffy and cuss-laced “man of the peo­ple”.</p>
    <p>I vividly re­mem­ber how, dur­ing an award­ing cer­e­mony in Mala­canang, the Pres­i­dent, then still in his first year in of­fice, boasted that he is “haunted by former pres­i­dents” since he al­ways “mis­be­haves”.</p>
    <p>In a coun­try where the elite love to bran­dish their His­panic an­ces­tors and Amer­i­can ac­cents, Mr Duterte has proudly claimed to have come from Mus­lim (Maranao) and even Chi­nese an­ces­try.</p>
    <p>Where Mr Duterte stands out the most from his peers and pre­de­ces­sors is his venomous dis­dain for the West, par­tic­u­larly Amer­ica, and, ac­cord­ingly, his un­abashed fawn­ing over the au­thor­i­tar­ian lead­ers of Rus­sia and China.</p>
    <p>His for­eign pol­icy has been a sur­real melange of con­tra­dic­tions and chutz­pah.</p>
    <p>In truly pop­ulist fash­ion, he has threat­ened to bank­rupt the coun­try’s most pow­er­ful busi­ness­men, the mes­tizo bil­lion­aires who dom­i­nate the econ­omy and have long been seen as un­touch­able.</p>
    <p>Most cru­cially, though he is the old­est man to have ever oc­cu­pied Mala­canang, Mr Duterte, 75, is the most me­dia-savvy and en­er­getic leader in the coun­try’s his­tory.</p>
    <p>And here lies his ul­ti­mate se­cret to power, the foun­tain of his un­fath­omable charisma.</p>
    <p>By any ob­jec­tive stan­dard, Mr Duterte’s gov­er­nance record is at best mixed, and, in cer­tain ar­eas, plain me­diocre.</p>
    <p>Just think of his han­dling of the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the in­ter­na­tional med­i­cal jour­nal The Lancet, the Philip­pines’ cri­sis man­age­ment ranked in the bot­tom third of sur­veyed na­tions, a dis­mal 66th out of 91 coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Hit by the worst out­break in the re­gion, the Philip­pines is also ex­pected to suf­fer the sec­ond-worst eco­nomic con­trac­tion this year.</p>
    <p>No se­ri­ous thinker would look at key na­tional in­di­ca­tors in re­cent years and think that com­pe­tence is the name of the game.</p>
    <p>But Mr Duterte re­mains pop­u­lar be­cause he knows how to “project” lead­er­ship in our post­mod­ern sim­u­lacrum where “im­pres­sion man­age­ment” trumps ac­tual per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>Schol­ars of­ten use the term “per­for­ma­tive gov­er­nance” for this brand of lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>The great scholar of pop­ulism Ernesto La­clau also aptly used the</p>
    <p>term “empty sig­ni­fier”.</p>
    <p>In our at­ten­tion-deficit “age of so­cial me­dia”, do peo­ple re­ally care about de­tailed, fac­tual analy­ses?</p>
    <p>In the midst of this cri­sis, we have seen an emo­tion­ally trans­par­ent leader, ringed by gen­er­als and top Cabi­net mem­bers, de­liv­er­ing reg­u­lar State of the Na­tion per­ora­tions.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, le­gions of on­line pro­pa­gan­dists care­fully nip any crit­i­cism in the bud and tire­lessly re­in­force a cu­rated im­age of a de­ci­sive and re­li­able leader.</p>
    <p>Then there is the gen­er­alised cli­mate of fear in work­ing-class com­mu­ni­ties, the main sur­vey re­spon­dents as well as pri­mary</p>
    <p>wit­nesses to Mr Duterte’s scorched-earth drug war.</p>
    <p>No­tice the “some­what ap­prove” num­bers in sur­veys.</p>
    <p>In­ter­est­ingly, the lat­est Pulse Asia sur­veys co­in­cided with the Bayani­han 2 fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance to mil­lions of anx­ious Filipino fam­i­lies, who des­per­ately yearn for a “strong leader” amid a gen­er­a­tional cri­sis.</p>
    <p>In fact, it’s pre­cisely this atavis­tic need for a tough leader, a “father fig­ure”, which ex­plains why Mr Duterte’s pop­ulist peers are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing his­toric ap­proval rat­ings.</p>
    <p>At the height of the cri­sis, In­dia’s Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi saw</p>
    <p>his ap­proval rat­ings surg­ing to 90 per cent, while Turk­ish Pres­i­dent Re­cep Tayyip Er­do­gan en­joyed a 14-point bump.</p>
    <p>Even Brazil’s Pres­i­dent Jair Bol­sonaro, widely seen as among the most in­com­pe­tent lead­ers in re­cent months, is gar­ner­ing his best ap­proval rat­ings yet.</p>
    <p>But, above them all, at 91 per cent, is Mr Duterte – the mas­ter of per­for­ma­tive gov­er­nance, his pop­ulism a Shake­spearean stage.</p>
