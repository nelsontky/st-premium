    <p>The new on-board unit (OBU) to re­place the current in-ve­hi­cle unit has been un­veiled, with Sin­ga­pore set to switch to a satel­lite-based Elec­tronic Road Pric­ing (ERP) sys­tem (New ERP sys­tem to start in 2023 with­out dis­tance charg­ing, Sept 9).</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has long prided it­self on be­ing at the fore­front of tech­nol­ogy. But in this case, the three-piece OBU does not seem to re­flect that. It looks clunky and sticks out like a sore thumb.</p>
    <p>Most mod­ern cars have a dis­play mon­i­tor of some kind, be it part of the en­ter­tain­ment sys­tem, as a sep­a­rate mon­i­tor, or in the dis­play clus­ter lo­cated in front of the steer­ing wheel.</p>
    <p>We should aim to in­te­grate the new sys­tem seam­lessly into these ex­ist­ing dis­plays, in­stead of hav­ing a sep­a­rate de­vice. Any such form of dis­trac­tion poses a dan­ger.</p>
    <p>A UK study found that send­ing a text mes­sage de­lays re­ac­tion times by 37 per cent. By com­par­i­son, drink­ing to the le­gal limit de­lays re­ac­tion times by 13 per cent and speak­ing on a hand-held tele­phone de­lays re­ac­tion by 46 per cent, the Trans­port Re­search Lab­o­ra­tory found.</p>
    <p>Also, the OBU’s large dis­play looks rather tacky and does not blend into the dash­board.</p>
    <p>Re­search has shown that adding more in­ter­ac­tive smart de­vices ac­tu­ally increases the brak­ing dis­tance, thereby en­dan­ger­ing the mo­torist.</p>
    <p>When a car is on the move, there should be no rea­son to look at the OBU dis­play or even to touch it. In­struc­tions could be made au­di­ble.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, hav­ing three sep­a­rate parts to the OBU com­pli­cates in­stal­la­tion and re­pairs.</p>
    <p>Other coun­tries have taken up our ERP con­cept and added it to their road sys­tems. Here is an op­por­tu­nity to show how we can again be a pace­set­ter in this area. Peter Loon Seng Chee</p>
