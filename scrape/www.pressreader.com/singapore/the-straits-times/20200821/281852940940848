    <p>BEI­JING • Hong Kong will sus­pend an agree­ment on mu­tual le­gal as­sis­tance with the US, China’s For­eign Min­istry has said, in a tit-for­tat re­sponse to Washington end­ing some deals with the city.</p>
    <p>The US State Depart­ment had no­ti­fied Hong Kong on Wed­nes­day that Washington had sus­pended or ter­mi­nated three bi­lat­eral agree­ments with the semi-au­ton­o­mous city fol­low­ing China’s im­po­si­tion of a sweep­ing na­tional se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>“China urges the US to im­me­di­ately cor­rect its mis­takes,” For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian told a news brief­ing yes­ter­day, as he an­nounced the suspension of the deal on le­gal as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>The agree­ment, signed in 1997 be­fore Bri­tain re­turned the city to China, spec­i­fied that the US and Hong Kong gov­ern­ments would help each other in crim­i­nal mat­ters, such as trans­fer­ring peo­ple in cus­tody or search­ing and con­fis­cat­ing pro­ceeds of crime.</p>
    <p>The US State Depart­ment said ear­lier that the three agree­ments the US ended cov­ered “the sur­ren­der of fugi­tive offenders, the trans­fer of sen­tenced per­sons, and re­cip­ro­cal tax ex­emp­tions on in­come de­rived from the in­ter­na­tional op­er­a­tion of ships”.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, Washington im­posed sanc­tions on Hong Kong’s Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam along with 10 other se­nior of­fi­cials in the city, and crim­i­nalised any US fi­nan­cial trans­ac­tions with the group.</p>
    <p>A Hong Kong gov­ern­ment spokesman yes­ter­day ac­cused Washington of us­ing the city as a pawn in ties with China.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong author­i­ties said the three agree­ments ter­mi­nated on Wed­nes­day were ne­go­ti­ated “in good faith to ben­e­fit the peo­ples and busi­nesses of both sides”.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong spokesman added that end­ing the tax ex­emp­tions would in­crease the op­er­at­ing costs of ship­ping com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>“It will ham­per the de­vel­op­ment of the ship­ping sec­tor be­tween Hong Kong and the US, and is in no­body’s in­ter­est,” he said.</p>
    <p>The US de­ci­sion fol­lowed Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s or­der last month to end Hong Kong’s spe­cial sta­tus un­der US law to pun­ish China for what he called “op­pres­sive ac­tions” against the for­mer Bri­tish colony after Bei­jing im­posed the new se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>The law pun­ishes any act China con­sid­ers se­ces­sion, sub­ver­sion, ter­ror­ism or col­lu­sion with for­eign forces with up to life in prison, and has drawn crit­i­cism from West­ern coun­tries that worry it will end the free­doms promised when Hong Kong re­turned to Chi­nese rule.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing and the Hong Kong gov­ern­ment have defended the law as nec­es­sary to restor­ing or­der and pre­serv­ing pros­per­ity after months of at times vi­o­lent anti-gov­ern­ment protests last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump on Wed­nes­day called</p>
    <p>Hong Kong me­dia mogul Jimmy Lai, briefly de­tained last week un­der the se­cu­rity law, a “brave man” and ex­pressed his sup­port for the prodemoc­racy ad­vo­cate.</p>
    <p>Mr Lai was among 10 peo­ple de­tained on Aug 10, as some 200 po­lice of­fi­cers searched the newsroom of his Ap­ple Daily tabloid, which is un­apolo­get­i­cally crit­i­cal of China.</p>
