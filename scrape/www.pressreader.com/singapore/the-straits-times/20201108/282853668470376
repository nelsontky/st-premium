    <p>Salim Moin, a star of Sin­ga­pore foot­ball in the 1980s who once mem­o­rably scored four goals in a SEA Games match against the Philip­pines, died late on Fri­day from a heart at­tack. He was 59.</p>
    <p>It is un­der­stood he had com­plained of chest pains on Fri­day and was taken to Sengkang Gen­eral Hospi­tal, near his Hougang apart­ment. He leaves be­hind his wife, son and daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>Salim, a striker who was also adept in mid­field, played for the</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore FA, which rep­re­sented the Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (FAS) in Malaysian do­mes­tic com­pe­ti­tions from 1979 to 1993.</p>
    <p>He scored 63 goals in 176 ap­pear­ances for the team and helped them win the 1980 Malaysia Cup. He also played for the na­tional team in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>
    <p>To­gether with Fandi Ah­mad and V. Sun­dram Moor­thy, they were part of a for­mi­da­ble for­ward line that fea­tured at the 1983 Games on home soil. They beat Malaysia 2-1 and the Philip­pines 5-0 in the group stage be­fore ham­mer­ing Brunei 4-0 in the semi-fi­nals, but fell 2-1 to Thai­land in the fi­nal.</p>
    <p>Fandi, 58, de­scribed his for­mer team­mate as a ded­i­cated and re­mark­able player.</p>
    <p>He told The Sun­day Times yes­ter­day: “He was a colour­ful char­ac­ter both on and off the pitch.</p>
    <p>“Off the pitch, he was a jovial per­son, al­ways crack­ing light-hearted jokes and car­ry­ing a warm spirit ev­ery­where he went.</p>
    <p>“He will be greatly missed by many peo­ple and Sin­ga­pore foot­ball has lost one of its heroes.”</p>
    <p>After call­ing time on his play­ing ca­reer, he went into coach­ing and had stints at Tampines Rovers, Wood­lands Wellington and Hougang United, where he was as­sis­tant coach from De­cem­ber 2018 un­til re­cently. He also coached the for­mer Na­tional Foot­ball Academy from 2009 to 2010.</p>
    <p>Last year, he helped the Chee­tahs to third place in the Sin­ga­pore Pre­mier League, their best re­sult, and qual­ify for the AFC Cup.</p>
    <p>The FAS, in its trib­ute, said it was shocked and sad­dened by the news.</p>
    <p>Hougang de­scribed him as “an in­te­gral part of our 2019 side that pro­pelled the club to our best fin­ish last sea­son, cher­ished for his heart and per­son­al­ity on and off the pitch”.</p>
    <p>Hougang head coach Cle­ment Teo, 54, worked with Salim since the 1990s.</p>
    <p>“It’s not sunk in yet and it feels like some­thing in my life is miss­ing now,” he said, still in shock. “He was a very strict coach and the play­ers re­spected him. Tac­ti­cally, he’s the best I know in Sin­ga­pore and he was very knowl­edge­able. He played a huge role in get­ting Hougang to where (we) are to­day.</p>
    <p>“He helped me a lot and he was some­one I could rely on. I’ve learnt a lot from him, not just in foot­ball but in life as well.”</p>
    <p>For­mer Lions coach Jita Singh, who worked with Salim in the 1980s, re­mem­bers him as a hard­work­ing player who stood up for what he be­lieved in.</p>
    <p>Singh, 71, said Salim made his mark at 1983 Games with his lon­grange strikes and added: “He did quite well as a coach be­cause what­ever he prac­tised as a player, he preached as a coach. He was a ded­i­cated per­son with good char­ac­ter and he was ap­proach­able but at the same time, he didn’t com­pro­mise.</p>
    <p>“If he takes some­thing on, he’s very se­ri­ous about it. That was one of his hall­marks.”</p>
