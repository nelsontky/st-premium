    <p>The points raised by Mr Felix Kim Heok Eng touch on a fa­mil­iar topic (Work pro­cesses: How did in­com­plete cov­ered walk­way come about?, Dec 9).</p>
    <p>A few years ago, a new bus stop was constructe­d in front of my Hous­ing Board block. More than a year later, only part of the cov­ered walk­way link­ing the bus stop to the near­est block of flats was com­pleted.</p>
    <p>The town coun­cil’s ex­pla­na­tion was that the last part of the walk­way was un­der the purview of a dif­fer­ent au­thor­ity and hence needed ap­proval be­fore works could con­tinue.</p>
    <p>Another case, which was raised in Par­lia­ment in 2017, was of a cov­ered walk­way that stopped short of the en­trance to Khatib MRT sta­tion. It was re­ported that the last part of the walk­way could not be com­pleted be­cause that area was a des­ig­nated emer­gency fire es­cape route and the two agen­cies in­volved in the project could not agree on ways to meet the reg­u­la­tory re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>When Be­dok Town Cen­tre was re­ju­ve­nated in 2015, there were no shel­ters for the wheel­chair-friendly ramps.</p>
    <p>The HDB, in its re­ply to my query, said that “in view of the lim­ited bud­get, shel­ters could not be pro­vided to cover the new ramps. Hence, the up­grad­ing works were fo­cused on areas that best ben­e­fit the res­i­dents and users after the revamp”.</p>
    <p>One of the pur­poses of the HDB’s Re­mak­ing Our Heart­land pro­gramme is to meet the chang­ing needs of the com­mu­nity. With an age­ing pop­u­la­tion es­pe­cially in older hous­ing es­tates like Be­dok, the HDB should have worked with stake­hold­ers and agen­cies to in­clude im­prove­ment works that ben­e­fit the el­derly and wheel­chair users.</p>
    <p>The Mu­nic­i­pal Ser­vices Of­fice was set up to, among other things, “en­hance the de­liv­ery of mu­nic­i­pal ser­vices and in­fra­struc­ture”.</p>
    <p>To this end, it will bring op­er­a­tions of­fi­cers from var­i­ous gov­ern­ment agen­cies to­gether to dis­cuss multi-agency cases to im­prove the de­liv­ery of mu­nic­i­pal ser­vices.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the afore­men­tioned cases seem to il­lus­trate that there is still a lack of co­op­er­a­tion be­tween gov­ern­ment agen­cies, and it comes at the ex­pense of res­i­dents.</p>
