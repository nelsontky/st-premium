    <p>NEW YORK • Women’s Ten­nis As­so­ci­a­tion (WTA) chief Steve Si­mon can­not wait for the Tour to get back up and run­ning in Sicily next month and hopes the Palermo Open will pro­vide a blue­print for tour­na­ment oper­a­tions amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The women’s clay-court tour­na­ment, which gets un­der way in the Si­cil­ian cap­i­tal on Aug 3, will be the first for ei­ther the WTA or men’s ATP Tours since events were sus­pended in early March be­cause of the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>“I’d say there’s def­i­nitely an ex­cite­ment to get back to do­ing what we love,” WTA chair­man and chief ex­ec­u­tive Si­mon said via video call from the United States. “We’re go­ing into this with great hopes. And hope­fully we’ve found a so­lu­tion that will al­low ten­nis to op­er­ate in this en­vi­ron­ment.”</p>
    <p>He said the Tour was look­ing to stage as many tour­na­ments as pos­si­ble this year and the sec­ond week of the patched-to­gether cal­en­dar will see events in Prague and the United States both start­ing from Aug 10.</p>
    <p>“I think our first three events – Palermo, Prague and Lex­ing­ton – will cer­tainly cre­ate that path­way for us,” he added. “Those three tour­na­ments are go­ing to hap­pen un­less we re­ceive a last-minute is­sue from the gov­ern­ment or lo­cal med­i­cal of­fi­cials.”</p>
    <p>The ATP’s bid to restart the men’s sea­son at the Citi Open in Wash­ing­ton DC early next month has al­ready evap­o­rated and Si­mon said the WTA was for­tu­nate that its first tour­na­ment was in Europe.</p>
    <p>“It’s just a dif­fer­ence in our cal­en­dars that pro­vided us the op­por­tu­nity to be­gin in Europe, which I do think has been ad­van­ta­geous for us,” he said. “If you look around the world, the Euro­pean Union is prob­a­bly the most sta­ble area out­side of maybe China proper right now. That def­i­nitely helped us.</p>
    <p>“Start­ing them on clay is good from a health per­spec­tive as well, a lit­tle softer sur­face, as they come back to play and then they can evolve into the hard-court sea­son.”</p>
    <p>The sec­ond and third stops on the hard-court sea­son are in New York, at the Western & South­ern Open and US Open, but there are big ques­tions over whether they can go ahead. Si­mon said a fi­nal de­ci­sion would be made soon.</p>
    <p>The restart has di­vided opin­ion among the play­ers, with some 200,000 new Covid-19 cases be­ing re­ported glob­ally every day and travel re­stric­tions still in place.</p>
    <p>World No. 2 Si­mona Halep said on Wed­nes­day that she will play the Palermo and Prague tour­na­ments but cast fur­ther doubt on her US Open par­tic­i­pa­tion.</p>
    <p>She had hinted that she will fo­cus on Euro­pean events this year, wary of the health cri­sis in the United States which has left a ques­tion mark over the US Open from Aug 31.</p>
    <p>Her com­mit­ment ap­peared to be geared to­wards the resched­uled French Open, which gets un­der way in Paris on Sept 27.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can great Ser­ena Williams will re­turn to the court for the first time since the coro­n­avirus shut­down at the in­au­gu­ral Lex­ing­ton event in Ken­tucky. She has pre­vi­ously con­firmed that she will com­pete at the US Open, where she is seek­ing a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam sin­gles ti­tle.</p>
