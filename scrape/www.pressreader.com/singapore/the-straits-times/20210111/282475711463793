    <p>Emile Smith Rowe made the most of his red card re­prieve as the Ar­se­nal mid­fielder sent the FA Cup hold­ers into the fourth round with the de­ci­sive ex­tra-time strike in Satur­day’s 2-0 vic­tory against New­cas­tle.</p>
    <p>The sub­sti­tute avoided be­ing sent off when his foul on Sean Longstaff – ini­tially ruled a dis­missal – was changed to a book­ing after ref­eree Chris Ka­vanagh con­sulted the video as­sis­tant ref­eree (VAR) and pitch-side mon­i­tor.</p>
    <p>The 20-year-old academy grad­u­ate cel­e­brated with a fine fin­ish in the 109th minute. Pierre-Em­er­ick Aubameyang bagged the sec­ond in the fi­nal mo­ments of a hard-fought third-round tie at the Emi­rates.</p>
    <p>“It was bit of a re­lief for me with the (red card) in­ci­dent. It def­i­nitely wasn’t in­ten­tional,” he said. “I’m happy to get the goal. From a young kid, I have al­ways wanted to play for this club.</p>
    <p>“We knew how tough it was go­ing to be. It shows how to­gether we are. We have been work­ing to get closer as a group.”</p>
    <p>The Gun­ners gave boss Mikel Arteta the first sil­ver­ware of his reign when they beat Chelsea in the FA Cup fi­nal in Au­gust and the op­ti­mism pro­vided by that suc­cess is slowly re­turn­ing to north Lon­don after a dif­fi­cult pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The Spa­niard was fight­ing to save his job just three weeks ago, but three suc­ces­sive Premier League wins have lifted Ar­se­nal away from the rel­e­ga­tion zone.</p>
    <p>The hosts have won the FA Cup a record 14 times, in­clud­ing four times in the last seven sea­sons.</p>
    <p>The vic­tory came at a cost after Gabriel Martinelli, who re­turned only last month after six months out, turned his an­kle dur­ing the warm-up ses­sion.</p>
    <p>Arteta said: “I am gut­ted. We’re go­ing to have to see how he is. It didn’t look good.”</p>
