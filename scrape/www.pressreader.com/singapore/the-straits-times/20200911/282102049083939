    <p>LONDON • Stan­dard Char­tered said yes­ter­day that it would merge sev­eral of its busi­nesses and re­duce the num­ber of top ex­ec­u­tives as the Asia and Africa-fo­cused bank seeks to trim costs and cre­ate a leaner busi­ness.</p>
    <p>StanChart said it would merge its re­tail, pri­vate and busi­ness bank­ing di­vi­sions to­gether un­der the lead­er­ship of cur­rent Asean and South Asia chief ex­ec­u­tive Judy Hsu, who will con­tinue to be based in Singapore.</p>
    <p>The reshuf­fle will also bring its two Asian units to­gether un­der Greater China and North Asia head Ben Hung, who will con­tinue to be based in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Ms Tracy Clarke, cur­rently re­gional chief ex­ec­u­tive of Europe and Amer­i­cas, and head of the com­pany’s pri­vate bank, is to re­tire.</p>
    <p>The changes will take ef­fect on Jan 1 next year.</p>
    <p>With this shift, both the global busi­ness CEOs over­see­ing all the bank’s busi­ness lines will be based in Singapore. Mr Si­mon Cooper, now the chief ex­ec­u­tive for cor­po­rate, com­mer­cial and in­sti­tu­tional bank­ing, is al­ready based here.</p>
    <p>Singapore re­mains a strate­gi­cally im­por­tant mar­ket for the group, a bank spokesman told The Straits Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Over the years as we ex­panded our pres­ence in Singapore, we have also in­vested in up­skilling our peo­ple’s ca­pa­bil­i­ties and skills as well as grown our work­force,” she said.</p>
    <p>Last month, the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Singapore des­ig­nated StanChart as the coun­try’s first Sig­nif­i­cantly Rooted For­eign Bank, re­flect­ing the bank’s sub­stan­tial pres­ence in the city state.</p>
    <p>The lat­est move sees group chief ex­ec­u­tive Bill Win­ters re­duce the num­ber of se­nior lieu­tenants un­der him, as he tries to keep a lid on costs amid low in­ter­est rates, slow­ing eco­nomic growth and the ef­fects of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Win­ters said “the in­creased fo­cus on con­nect­ing our Asian busi­ness will al­low us to bet­ter serve our cor­po­rate and in­sti­tu­tional clients as they de­velop their busi­nesses across these dy­namic mar­kets”.</p>
    <p>“These changes will lead to ex­pan­sion of the scope and re­spon­si­bil­i­ties of sev­eral se­nior roles below the group’s man­age­ment team, im­prov­ing man­age­ment bench-strength and ac­cel­er­at­ing our pur­suit of a more di­verse, per­for­mance-ori­ented and in­no­va­tive cul­ture.”</p>
    <p>The move also merges StanChart’s un­der­per­form­ing pri­vate bank back into the broader re­tail and busi­ness bank­ing di­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>StanChart has strug­gled for years to com­pete for the busi­ness of wealthy in­di­vid­u­als in its tar­get mar­kets, with the unit mak­ing a loss of US$14 mil­lion (S$19 mil­lion) in 2018 and a profit of just US$94 mil­lion last year.</p>
    <p>The group will still re­port its re­sults ac­cord­ing to the cur­rent struc­ture for the re­main­der of this year.</p>
