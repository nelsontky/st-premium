    <p>Mi­grant work­ers who feel un­well at night can now seek help at three free night clin­ics lo­cated in re­gional med­i­cal cen­tres around the is­land.</p>
    <p>Since Aug 28, 13 re­gional and on­site med­i­cal cen­tres have been set up to meet the health­care needs of mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>These have been com­ple­mented by mo­bile clin­i­cal teams and telemedici­ne us­ing the FWMOMCare app, said the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the phys­i­cal cen­tres cur­rently op­er­ate un­til 6.30pm.</p>
    <p>The night clin­ics are open from 6.30pm to 9.30pm daily and al­low work­ers to seek face-to-face help be­yond the pre­vi­ous op­er­at­ing hours.</p>
    <p>They are lo­cated at Space@Tuas Recre­ation Cen­tre in the south­west, Cochrane Recre­ation Cen­tre in the north and Kaki Bukit Recre­ation Cen­tre in the east.</p>
    <p>MOM had ear­lier said that as dor­mi­to­ries con­tinue to be at risk of new in­fec­tions, mi­grant work­ers who re­side there can use only gov­ern­ment-pro­vided ini­tia­tives for non-emer­gency med­i­cal at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>The med­i­cal cen­tres pro­vide sim­ple acute and chronic care man­age­ment, as well as men­tal health­care, sim­i­lar to the out­pa­tient ser­vices pro­vided by some gen­eral prac­ti­tion­ers in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>To sup­ple­ment this, telemedici­ne is avail­able at all hours. And when an emerg­ing clus­ter is de­tected, mo­bile clin­i­cal teams can also be ac­ti­vated.</p>
    <p>MOM said its As­sur­ance, Care and En­gage­ment Group hopes that the night clin­ics will en­cour­age mi­grant work­ers to seek med­i­cal at­ten­tion when they need it.</p>
    <p>The group will eval­u­ate the re­sponse to the night clin­ics and see if more such fa­cil­i­ties are re­quired.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers and dor­mi­tory op­er­a­tors can make a book­ing through the man­ag­ing agent in charge of the dor­mi­tory’s re­gion. The agent will then ar­range trans­port to the night clin­ics for the work­ers if they are re­sid­ing in dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Those who wish to make an ap­point­ment for their work­ers at Space@Tuas Recre­ation Cen­tre should call 8349-1374, while the num­ber for Kaki Bukit Recre­ation Cen­tre is 8933-7687.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers and dor­mi­tory op­er­a­tors schedul­ing ap­point­ments for their work­ers at Cochrane Recre­ation Cen­tre be­fore 5.30pm can call 8933-7756, and 8544-4250 for ap­point­ments from 6.30pm.</p>
    <p>For work­ers re­sid­ing in the com­mu­nity, such as in Hous­ing Board flats or pri­vate res­i­den­tial premises, no trans­port will be pro­vided.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers will need to ar­range trans­port for them in­stead.</p>
    <p>MOM said the fight against Covid-19 is the shared re­spon­si­bil­ity of mi­grant work­ers, em­ploy­ers and dor­mi­tory op­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>It added: “Con­tin­ued vig­i­lance is crit­i­cal, and mi­grant work­ers should not re­turn to work if they feel un­well.</p>
    <p>“In­stead, they should seek med­i­cal at­ten­tion im­me­di­ately at one of the med­i­cal cen­tres or through telemedici­ne, and abide by safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“To­gether, we can con­tain the spread of Covid-19.”</p>
