    <p>MAK­ING A DIF­FER­ENCE</p>
    <p>The fact that I am able to keep the el­derly happy through my vis­its once a week for two hours, which is not a lot of my time, keeps me go­ing. I know that... this small act is re­ally mak­ing a huge dif­fer­ence for some­one else.</p>
    <p>LIONS BE­FRIEN­DERS VOL­UN­TEER KEN­NARD TAY SZE HAN</p>
    <p>While help­ing the el­derly liv­ing alone in Jalan Bukit Merah, poly­tech­nic stu­dent Ken­nard Tay Sze Han re­alised that most of them could not un­der­stand their med­i­cal bills and bank state­ments in English.</p>
    <p>The 18-year-old vol­un­teer with Lions Be­frien­ders, who has been mak­ing weekly vis­its to the el­derly since 2016, started trans­lat­ing let­ters from English to Man­darin for them.</p>
    <p>“The vol­un­teers and I need to let them know what’s go­ing on, es­pe­cially with their med­i­cal and den­tal bills. Ev­ery time I visit them, I can see their smiles ra­di­ate from their faces and they are re­ally happy that we are here,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>For the past three months, he has also been teach­ing the el­derly how to use their smart­phones. This is on top of his du­ties of help­ing them change their bed sheets and buy gro­ceries.</p>
    <p>“The fact that I am able to keep the el­derly happy through my vis­its once a week for two hours, which is not a lot of my time, keeps</p>
    <p>me go­ing. I know that... this small act is re­ally mak­ing a huge dif­fer­ence for some­one else,” he added.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond-year Sin­ga­pore Poly­tech­nic stu­dent is also part of the Boys’ Bri­gade (BB) and serves as the deputy com­pany sergeant ma­jor of Nan Hua High School.</p>
    <p>He was one of seven se­nior cadet</p>
    <p>lieu­tenants who re­ceived the Pres­i­dent’s Award from Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob at the Is­tana yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The award is the high­est ac­co­lade in BB and is pre­sented to the top mem­bers of the Primers Pro­gramme, for those be­tween 16 and 18 years old.</p>
    <p>Awardees must meet the de­mand­ing re­quire­ments in lead­er­ship and ser­vice in the com­mu­nity span­ning at least six years, as well as in BB as ac­tiv­ity lead­ers or event plan­ners.</p>
    <p>Bren­dan Soh Heng Yi, 18, who re­cently com­pleted his In­ter­na­tional Bac­calau­re­ate course at An­glo-Chi</p>
    <p>nese School (In­de­pen­dent), re­ceived the award for lead­ing his school’s BB com­pany as train­ing head and band primer, as well as for his com­mu­nity work in­clud­ing vol­un­teer­ing as a tu­tor in the Sal­va­tion Army.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally trea­sure the jour­ney that has led up to this award. All the new things I’ve tried, all the friends and ju­niors that I’ve made friends with, and the awe­some op­por­tu­nity to touch lives and im­pact my ju­niors,” he said.</p>
    <p>An­other re­cip­i­ent was Evan Lim Shouwang, 18, who has just com­pleted his A lev­els at An­glo-Chi­nese Ju­nior Col­lege.</p>
    <p>He led the An­glo-Chi­nese School (Barker Road) com­pany as a head primer and as­sisted in the op­er­a­tions for BB’s an­nual Share-a-Gift project for four years.</p>
    <p>He helped co­or­di­nate the col­lec­tion of do­nated goods such as rice and canned food, which are repack­aged and sent to needy Sin­ga­porean fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>“I feel hon­oured to get the award but what was more ful­fill­ing was the jour­ney, growth and devel­op­ment since Sec­ondary 1 that led up to this mo­ment. I re­ceived guid­ance from my se­niors when I started BB, and am now lead­ing my ju­niors. This brings it full cir­cle,” he said.</p>
