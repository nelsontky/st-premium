    <p>Long-term in­vestors may still be lick­ing their wounds as stocks re­cover from the coro­n­avirus slump ear­lier this year, but it pro­vided an in­cred­i­ble buy­ing op­por­tu­nity and re­tail in­vestors have piled into re­bound­ing mar­kets even as ex­perts warn against it be­ing a sure bet.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of peo­ple pump­ing a few thou­sand dol­lars into stocks has leapt since March in many coun­tries across the world, es­pe­cially since ul­tra-low in­ter­est rates mean that those who have saved some money have fewer at­trac­tive in­vest­ment op­tions.</p>
    <p>In In­dia, “we have seen a sharp 50 per cent jump in first-time users in­vest­ing in the mar­kets since March”, fi­nan­cial con­sul­tant Aditya Joshi told AFP. “Many housewives with no prior ex­pe­ri­ence too have started trad­ing,” he noted.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s econ­omy has suf­fered a record slump, mean­while, with gross do­mes­tic prod­uct plung­ing by al­most 24 per cent from one quar­ter to the next.</p>
    <p>The Re­serve Bank of In­dia has taken note, and warned that the “dis­con­nect be­tween the two (re­al­i­ties) car­ries risks.</p>
    <p>“Rel­a­tively buoy­ant global fi­nan­cial mar­kets demon­strate not just a dis­con­nect with un­der­ly­ing eco­nomic fun­da­men­tals, but also por­tend fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity risks, par­tic­u­larly for emerg­ing mar­ket economies,” the bank noted in a re­cent re­port.</p>
    <p>Bursa Malaysia warned re­tail in­vestors against chas­ing rumours and lis­ten­ing to un­li­censed “in­vest­ment celebri­ties” on so­cial me­dia. It re­it­er­ated tra­di­tional ad­vice: Study the fun­da­men­tals of a com­pany be­fore in­vest­ing.</p>
    <p>In France, the fi­nan­cial mar­kets watchdog AMF has recorded 700,000 new re­tail in­vestors since last Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>On­line bank Bour­so­rama told AFP that the num­ber of peo­ple us­ing its mar­ket trad­ing plat­form had tripled, and the num­ber of or­ders was four times higher.</p>
    <p>New clients in­vest an av­er­age of €5,000 (S$8,000), all of which re­sulted in 2020 be­ing a “re­mark­able” year for the com­pany.</p>
    <p>Paris dig­i­tal strat­egy con­sul­tant Alexan­dre, 25, is one such in­vestor, and he checks his stocks twice a day. Since March, the value of his €6,000 port­fo­lio has gained about 15 per cent, far more than he could make with a tra­di­tional sav­ings ac­count or gov­ern­ment bonds.</p>
    <p>“I am look­ing at ex­cep­tional num­bers, I know that,” he said.</p>
    <p>While de­clin­ing to pro­vide his last name, Alexan­dre was will­ing to say he was bet­ting on air­craft man­u­fac­turer Air­bus, as well as World­line and In­genico, two firms in­volved with on­line pay­ments.</p>
    <p>He said he is aware that “ev­ery­thing could col­lapse from one day to the next”.</p>
    <p>Mr Gabriel Con­tas­sot, a French de­signer, said he be­gan in­vest­ing on March 17, a day after the Dow Jones In­dus­trial Av­er­age suf­fered its big­gest drop in 33 years.</p>
    <p>“I con­sid­ered this pe­riod a bit like the sales,” he joked in ref­er­ence to reg­u­lated times of the year when French stores are al­lowed to sell at a dis­count.</p>
    <p>His US$18,000 (S$24,500) port­fo­lio com­prises pan­demic “win­ners” such as Alibaba, Ama­zon, Tesla and Zoom and on pa­per he has made around US$6,000, he said.</p>
    <p>Like many new re­tail in­vestors in the United States, Mr Con­tas­sot uses his mo­bile phone to buy and sell stocks via an app. In his case, it is Robin­hood, which charges no com­mis­sion and is user-friendly.</p>
    <p>In In­dia, the pop­u­lar apps are Zerodha and Paytm Money and they too have put many peo­ple at a vir­tual trader’s desk. The pic­ture is sim­i­lar in other parts of Asia.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies listed in Sin­ga­pore have been boosted by an in­flux of $9.6 bil­lion from re­tail in­vestors be­tween Jan 1 and Sept 22, the lo­cal stock ex­change said.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s main mar­ket re­ports a net in­crease of US$37.7 bil­lion in pur­chases, com­pared with a net in­crease of US$6.4 bil­lion in sales one year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>And in Ja­pan, the num­ber of re­tail trad­ing ac­counts soared by 72 per cent in late March com­pared with the same month in 2019, the Fi­nan­cial Ser­vices Agency said.</p>
    <p>But it does not al­ways end well. “I had no no­tion of how to trade,” ac­knowl­edged Mr Ay­man Das­souli, a stu­dent in France who saw €3,000 go up in smoke on the eToro plat­form be­tween June and Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Many, how­ever, have ex­pe­ri­enced the thrill of see­ing the num­bers climb steadily higher with only rare mo­ments of doubt. And they hope the dance will go on.</p>
    <p>“Hon­estly, I see lots of op­por­tu­nity in this deadly coro­n­avirus pan­demic,” said Mr Den­nis Chong, a 47-year-old Malaysian re­tail in­vestor. He con­cluded: “It is party time.”</p>
