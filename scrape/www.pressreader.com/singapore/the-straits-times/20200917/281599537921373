    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong has con­grat­u­lated Mr Yoshi­hide Suga for step­ping into his new role as prime min­is­ter of Ja­pan, which he calls “a val­ued part­ner of Asean”.</p>
    <p>In a let­ter to Mr Suga yes­ter­day, PM Lee un­der­lined the wide-rang­ing part­ner­ship be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Ja­pan across ar­eas rang­ing from eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion and dis­as­ter man­age­ment to con­nec­tiv­ity and ca­pac­ity-build­ing.</p>
    <p>“I un­der­stand that one of your pri­or­i­ties will be dig­i­tal­is­ing your gov­ern­ment. The Asean Smart Cities Net­work can be one plat­form for us to col­lab­o­rate in this area,” said PM Lee. The net­work is a col­lab­o­ra­tive plat­form of the 10-mem­ber bloc with the goal of achiev­ing smart and sus­tain­able ur­ban devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, the two coun­tries “have demon­strated the re­silience of our ex­cel­lent re­la­tion­ship”, PM Lee added.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, Sin­ga­pore and Ja­pan an­nounced a green lane for es­sen­tial busi­ness and of­fi­cial travel for res­i­dents from both coun­tries with ef­fect from to­mor­row, to help boost eco­nomic re­cov­ery for both sides.</p>
    <p>“We have worked closely to main­tain sup­ply chain con­nec­tiv­ity, re­store travel and sup­port the re­cov­ery of our economies,” said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>“Next year, we mark the 55th an­niver­sary of the es­tab­lish­ment of di­plo­matic re­la­tions. There is much more we can do to­gether, in­clud­ing to tackle com­mon chal­lenges such as our age­ing pop­u­la­tions.”</p>
    <p>Mr Suga was sworn into of­fice yes­ter­day, tak­ing the helm from Mr Shinzo Abe, who stepped down due to poor health.</p>
    <p>PM Lee said it has been a priv­i­lege to have worked with Mr Abe – who served two non-con­sec­u­tive terms as pre­mier – for close to a decade.</p>
    <p>“You leave of­fice with an im­pres­sive track record, after achiev­ing a his­toric mile­stone by be­com­ing</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s long­est-serv­ing prime min­is­ter,” said PM Lee in a vale­dic­tory let­ter to his for­mer coun­ter­part.</p>
    <p>“As a sig­na­tory to the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship, Sin­ga­pore is grate­ful for the de­ci­sive lead­er­ship you ex­er­cised to bring this agree­ment to a suc­cess­ful con­clu­sion, after the US with­drew from the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship,” said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>Call­ing Mr Abe “a good friend”, PM Lee noted: “You have strength­ened our ro­bust re­la­tion­ship, which I look for­ward to build­ing on with your suc­ces­sor.”</p>
