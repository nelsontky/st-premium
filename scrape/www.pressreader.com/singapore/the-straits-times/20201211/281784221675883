    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON The United States on Wed­nes­day crossed an omi­nous new thresh­old of more than 3,250 lives lost to Covid-19 in a sin­gle day while pub­lic health of­fi­cials stepped up prepa­ra­tions for a vac­cine cam­paign of his­toric scope ahead of fi­nal reg­u­la­tory re­view.</p>
    <p>Steady move­ment to­wards a vac­cine roll-out on the eve of a crit­i­cal re­view by lead­ing US med­i­cal ex­perts comes as Covid-19 caseloads surged alarm­ingly, strain­ing med­i­cal sys­tems in some pan­demic hot spots to the break­ing point.</p>
    <p>In­ten­sive care units (ICUs) at hun­dreds of hos­pi­tals in cities and ru­ral com­mu­ni­ties across the coun­try were re­ported to be at or near ca­pac­ity, Depart­ment of Health and Hu­man Ser­vices data showed.</p>
    <p>Ten mostly ru­ral coun­ties scat­tered across Cal­i­for­nia re­ported hav­ing no ICU beds on Wed­nes­day, ac­cord­ing to state health fig­ures an­a­lysed by Reuters.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of Covid-19 pa­tients hos­pi­talised na­tion­wide grew to a new all-time high of 106,217 by late Wed­nes­day, up some 18 per cent over the pre­vi­ous two weeks.</p>
    <p>The US also has doc­u­mented an av­er­age of 2,259 deaths and 205,661 new in­fec­tions each day over the past week, a toll that health of­fi­cials warn is likely to ac­cel­er­ate in the com­ing months be­fore a vac­cine be­comes widely avail­able to the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>At least 3,253 pa­tients died on Wed­nes­day alone, a Reuters tally of state-by-state data shows. It sur­passed the pre­vi­ous Dec 3 record of 2,861 deaths and was the first time the virus has claimed 3,000 US lives or more in a sin­gle day.</p>
    <p>To date, the highly con­ta­gious res­pi­ra­tory ill­ness has killed more than 289,000 Amer­i­cans, out of some 15 mil­lion known to have been in­fected since Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Med­i­cal ex­perts have said the cri­sis will only worsen in the weeks ahead, amid colder weather, es­pe­cially if Amer­i­cans con­tinue to dis­re­gard warn­ings to avoid un­nec­es­sary travel and large gath­er­ings over the hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the mon­u­men­tal hu­man cost, the pan­demic has wreaked havoc on the econ­omy, forc­ing mil­lions out of work as pub­lic health au­thor­i­ties im­posed sweep­ing re­stric­tions on so­cial and eco­nomic life in a bid to curb the out­break.</p>
    <p>Congress, mean­while, has strug­gled to end a months-long po­lit­i­cal stale­mate over an eco­nomic as­sis­tance plan. The Demo­cratic-con­trolled House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives on Wed­nes­day ap­proved a one­week ex­ten­sion of fed­eral gov­ern­ment fund­ing, giv­ing law­mak­ers more time to hag­gle over a broader spend­ing pack­age.</p>
    <p>The Repub­li­can-led Se­nate was ex­pected to vote on the mea­sure as early as yes­ter­day and send it to Pres­i­dent Donald Trump in time to avoid a gov­ern­ment shut­down. But dis­agree­ments re­main over busi­ness li­a­bil­ity pro­tec­tions de­manded by Repub­li­cans and aid to state and lo­cal gov­ern­ments sought by Democrats be­fore a fi­nal deal is reached on eco­nomic aid.</p>
    <p>Of­fer­ing a new glim­mer of hope, how­ever, some of­fi­cials said vac­ci­na­tions could be­gin as soon as this week­end, and states have es­ca­lated plans for distributi­on.</p>
    <p>A panel of in­de­pen­dent med­i­cal ex­perts was due to meet yes­ter­day to de­cide whether to rec­om­mend that the vac­cine by Pfizer and its Ger­man part­ner BioN­Tech should re­ceive emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion from the Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA).</p>
    <p>In a sign that ap­proval could be swift, doc­u­ments re­leased by the FDA ahead of the re­view raised no new red flags over the safety or ef­fi­cacy of the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>FDA con­sent could come as early as to­day or to­mor­row, fol­lowed by the first US in­jec­tions on Sun­day or Mon­day, said Dr Mon­cef Slaoui, chief ad­viser to the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed vac­cine devel­op­ment pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The US is in dire need of a new mech­a­nism for fight­ing the pan­demic, given that so many Amer­i­cans have re­fused to fol­low guid­ance on wear­ing of face masks and so­cial dis­tanc­ing ex­cept for peo­ple in their own house­holds.</p>
    <p>Health and Hu­man Ser­vices Sec­re­tary Alex Azar has told CBS This Morn­ing that he ex­pected in­oc­u­la­tions to be reach­ing the gen­eral pub­lic in Fe­bru­ary, March and April, with enough vac­cine sup­ply “for all Amer­i­cans” dur­ing the sec­ond quar­ter of next year.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Chicago ex­pects to get thou­sands of coro­n­avirus vac­cine doses this month and is aim­ing to of­fer them free of charge to all adult res­i­dents next year, city of­fi­cials said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>After Pfizer and Moderna re­ceive emer­gency fed­eral ap­provals and the city gets guid­ance from an im­mu­ni­sa­tion ad­vi­sory com­mit­tee, Chicago can move for­ward with its vac­cine roll-out plan.</p>
    <p>The city will al­lo­cate its ini­tial doses to its 34 hos­pi­tals in the week of Dec 14, of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>Health­care work­ers who treat Covid-19 pa­tients or con­duct pro­ce­dures that put them at high risk for spread will be the first to re­ceive the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Chicago has about 400,000 health work­ers, in­clud­ing doc­tors, nurses and other hos­pi­tal staff.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ees and work­ers at longterm care fa­cil­i­ties will be the next re­cip­i­ents, fol­lowed by es­sen­tial work­ers, peo­ple with un­der­ly­ing med­i­cal con­di­tions and those 65 years and older. Chicago ex­pects to re­ceive about 23,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioN­Tech vac­cine in the first week after fed­eral ap­proval and could get as many as 150,000 doses of Moderna’s this month, said its pub­lic health depart­ment com­mis­sioner Allison Ar­wady.</p>
    <p>The day Covid-19 Amer­i­can deaths crossed the 3,000 mark in a sin­gle day, at 3,253.</p>
    <p>Health and Hu­man Ser­vices Sec­re­tary Alex Azar has told CBS This Morn­ing he ex­pected in­oc­u­la­tions to be reach­ing the gen­eral pub­lic in Fe­bru­ary, March and April, with enough vac­cine sup­ply “for all Amer­i­cans” dur­ing the sec­ond quar­ter of next year.</p>
