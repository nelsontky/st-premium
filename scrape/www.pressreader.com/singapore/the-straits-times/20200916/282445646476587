    <p>SYD­NEY • Or­gan­is­ers are plough­ing ahead with the post­poned Tokyo Olympics and will de­cide by the end of the year what “coun­ter­mea­sures” are re­quired to hold them safely in the time of Covid-19, IOC vice-pres­i­dent John Coates said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian heads the In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee’s (IOC) Co­or­di­na­tion Com­mis­sion for the Tokyo Games, which were de­layed un­til next July be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Coates told re­porters or­gan­is­ers were “throw­ing what­ever re­sources are nec­es­sary” at the Games.</p>
    <p>“Our de­ci­sion at the mo­ment is to go ahead,” he said at an event mark­ing the 20th an­niver­sary of the 2000 Syd­ney Olympics open­ing cer­e­mony in which t he city’s Games caul­dron was reignited.</p>
    <p>“What we wait for is to de­cide what coun­ter­mea­sures we need to go ahead with, to pro­ceed de­pend­ing on what stage Covid is at.</p>
    <p>“The ex­tent of the cer­e­monies, the ex­tent of the crowd par­tic­i­pa­tion, any nec­es­sary quar­an­tine when they ar­rive in Ja­pan. All of those things.</p>
    <p>“And by the time we get to the end of the year, we’ll make an as­sess­ment on what coun­ter­mea­sures we’ll need to ap­ply.”</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese gov­ern­ment and the IOC took the un­prece­dented de­ci­sion in March to post­pone the Games, which were orig­i­nally sched­uled to be­gin in July.</p>
    <p>Tokyo of­fi­cials have said they in­tend to put on the Games next year even if the pan­demic has not eased sub­stan­tially.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s re­tired five-time Olympic cham­pion swim­mer Ian Thorpe said he wanted to see the Tokyo Games go ahead but was doubt­ful they could with­out a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>“First and fore­most is peo­ple’s health,” he told re­porters at the Syd­ney Games cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>“So let’s put that into per­spec­tive and if we haven’t got a treat­ment or a vac­cine for Covid, the Olympics will pos­si­bly not go ahead.”</p>
