    <p>Delin­quency rates for res­i­den­tial mort­gages also posted the largest quar­terly in­crease on record.</p>
    <p>“A high delin­quency rate for an ex­tended pe­riod can im­pair the bank­ing sys­tem,” said Com­mon­wealth Bank of Aus­tralia cur­rency an­a­lyst Joseph Ca­purso.</p>
    <p>“An im­paired bank­ing sys­tem could hold back the US eco­nomic re­cov­ery like it did in the aftermath of the (2008 cri­sis),” he said.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese yen rose back past 106-per-dol­lar to 105.88 after a 2.6 ba­sis point drop in bench­mark US 10-year gov­ern­ment bond yields overnight.</p>
    <p>In­vestors ex­pect the re­lease of US Fed­eral Re­serve min­utes to­day to pos­si­bly de­ter­mine the next moves.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish pound was stalled around US$1.1311 as in­vestors are watch­ing the lat­est round of Brexit ne­go­ti­a­tions, with the fu­ture of Lon­don’s fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions’ ac­cess to the Euro­pean mar­ket in fo­cus.</p>
    <p>Against a bas­ket of cur­ren­cies, the dol­lar sat at an eight-ses­sion low of 92.762.</p>
    <p>Among G10 cur­ren­cies, the kiwi was the lag­gard as New Zealand’s largest city re­mains un­der lockdown and an­tic­i­pa­tion of fu­ture mon­e­tary eas­ing weighs on the cur­rency.</p>
    <p>It last bought US$0.6557 and traders said bets on the kiwi drop­ping had sup­ported the Aussie dol­lar as in­vestors sought ex­po­sure to the Aussie/kiwi cross, which is trad­ing at a two-year peak.</p>
    <p>“The move has been one-way traf­fic,” said Mr Chris We­ston, head of re­search at Mel­bourne bro­ker Pep­per­stone, who is hold­ing for the ride even though the pair has hit his price tar­get of NZ$1.10 per Aussie dol­lar.</p>
    <p>Be­lea­guered off­shore marine com­pany KS En­ergy clar­i­fied on Mon­day that a debt owed to OCBC Bank by its sub­sidiary KS Drilling was lower than US$230 mil­lion (S$314 mil­lion), as pre­vi­ously re­ported.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore-listed com­pany said the debt to South-east Asia’s sec­ond-largest lender is “se­cured by var­i­ous as­sets, in­clud­ing KS Drilling’s jack-up and land rigs”.</p>
    <p>The state­ment also ad­dressed the res­ig­na­tion of Kris Wiluan, KS En­ergy’s former chair­man, chief ex­ec­u­tive and di­rec­tor, who is fac­ing 112 charges for al­leged mar­ket rig­ging and false trad­ing.</p>
    <p>Wiluan said in the lat­est state­ment that his de­ci­sion to re­sign “was to al­low him to fo­cus on his de­fence and to not let KS En­ergy group be dis­tracted or be en­tan­gled by his per­sonal prob­lems”. He said he sup­ports the board’s choice of his son Richard suc­ceed­ing him as CEO and chair­man.</p>
    <p>“Like all com­pa­nies in the off­shore and marine sec­tor, KS En­ergy is fac­ing un­prece­dented chal­lenges from the dev­as­tat­ing im­pact of Covid-19 on the global econ­omy,” the older busi­ness­man said. “Richard will work closely with our cred­i­tors and busi­ness part­ners to navigate through this cri­sis,” he added.</p>
    <p>It was re­ported last week that OCBC is­sued let­ters of demand to the firm and its eight units to pay up out­stand­ing loans of US$230.7 mil­lion and $10.3 mil­lion, or face le­gal ac­tion, in­clud­ing a pos­si­ble wind­ing-up.</p>
    <p>KS En­ergy is “seek­ing le­gal ad­vice and will en­gage OCBC to rem­edy the sit­u­a­tion, and to ad­vance the in­ter­ests of all stake­hold­ers”.</p>
