    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) • At 158, three be­hind leader Derek Fisher, LeBron James looks des­tined to be­come the player with the most num­ber of play-off wins in Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) his­tory.</p>
    <p>If that hap­pens this sea­son, it would mean that the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers will be one step closer to­wards their first cham­pi­onship since 2010 – a prospect the for­ward would love noth­ing more.</p>
    <p>James passed San An­to­nio Spurs great Tim Dun­can (157) on the list as his team out­played the Port­land Trail Blaz­ers on both ends of the floor on Satur­day for a 116-108 win in Game 3 of their Western Con­fer­ence first-round play-off se­ries.</p>
    <p>The three-time NBA cham­pion led all scorers, fin­ish­ing with 38 points, while team­mate An­thony Davis added 29 points as the Lak­ers took a 2-1 lead.</p>
    <p>Since they linked up last sum­mer, teams have strug­gled to cope with their All-Star part­ner­ship and the Blaz­ers, who were paced by 34 points from Damian Lil­lard, suf­fered the same fate at Dis­ney World.</p>
    <p>Davis and James be­came the first Lak­ers pair­ing to have both 25-plus points and 10-plus re­bounds in the post-sea­son since Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal in the 2002 Western Con­fer­ence Fi­nals.</p>
    <p>It is why crit­ics have ear­marked the team as one of the cham­pi­onship favourites, with James at­tribut­ing their chem­istry to a self­less at­ti­tude.</p>
    <p>On how well they have clicked in what is their first year to­gether, he said: “Be­cause we’re two guys who know who we are. We know who we are as hu­man be­ings. We’re not try­ing to be no­body else but our own iden­tity, our own self.</p>
    <p>“And when you know your­self and when you’re con­fi­dent in what you do, both on and off the floor and you know what you rep­re­sent, then there’s no ego.</p>
    <p>“We want both of us to suc­ceed, both on and off the floor. We want our fam­i­lies to be happy. We want each other to try to be as happy as pos­si­ble... so when you’re able to fig­ure that out in life – who you are and what you stand for – then noth­ing else mat­ters.”</p>
    <p>On over­tak­ing Dun­can, James was hum­bled to be men­tioned in the same cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>“It’s just al­ways sur­real for me when my name is as­so­ci­ated with any of the greats,” he said. “And ob­vi­ously, you know how great Tim was in this league with that fran­chise... Ba­si­cally, he lived in the post-sea­son. That was his ad­dress.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Mil­wau­kee Bucks looked more like the team with the best reg­u­lar-sea­son record in the NBA (56-17) as they rolled to a 121-107 vic­tory over Or­lando to take a 2-1 lead in their Western Con­fer­ence play-off se­ries.</p>
    <p>Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo – in the run­ning for a sec­ond straight Most Valu­able Player Award – scored 35 points and pulled down 11 boards, show­ing why the ti­tle con­tenders swept the Magic in all four matchups be­fore the post-sea­son.</p>
    <p>“It was a lot eas­ier be­cause we played de­fence,” said the Greek for­ward. “Once we play de­fence, we’re able to run in tran­si­tion and it makes the game easy.”</p>
    <p>Else­where in the East, Mi­ami with­stood a fu­ri­ous In­di­ana rally for a 124-115 win and 3-0 lead, while Ok­la­homa City edged out Hous­ton 119-107 to re­duce their Western se­ries deficit to 2-1.</p>
