    <p>SYD­NEY Tennis’ top stars will quar­an­tine in Ade­laide rather than Mel­bourne and play an ex­hi­bi­tion there ahead of the Aus­tralian Open, with the city also host­ing a WTA event af­ter the year’s first Grand Slam, or­gan­is­ers said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Some 1,270 play­ers and sup­port staff are due to ar­rive in Mel­bourne on char­ter flights late next week, where they will have to spend a manda­tory 14 days in quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>But, with ho­tel rooms in the city scarce, Aus­tralian Open chief Craig Ti­ley said he had ap­proached the South Aus­tralian govern­ment about tak­ing some of them.</p>
    <p>Mat­ters were fur­ther com­pli­cated when a ho­tel in Mel­bourne that was due to ac­com­mo­date play­ers pulled out on Tues­day, re­port­edly be­cause of con­cerns from res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>With lit­tle ben­e­fit to Ade­laide from putting its com­mu­nity at risk of coron­avirus by hous­ing play­ers, an ex­hi­bi­tion fea­tur­ing the top names in the game was sug­gested as an en­tice­ment.</p>
    <p>“It would be a ben­e­fit if they played an ex­hi­bi­tion tour­na­ment just be­fore they came to Mel­bourne, so the premier (Steven Mar­shall) has agreed to host 50 people in a quar­an­tine bub­ble and then have those play­ers play an ex­hi­bi­tion,” Ti­ley told Tennis Chan­nel.</p>
    <p>An of­fi­cial state­ment an­nounc­ing the Jan 29 “A Day at the Drive” ex­hi­bi­tion said it would feature the world’s top three men – No­vak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Do­minic Thiem – and two of the top three women in Si­mona Halep and Naomi Osaka.</p>
    <p>World No. 1 Ash­leigh Barty was not in­cluded, but 23-time Grand</p>
    <p>Slam win­ner Ser­ena Wil­liams was, with two more play­ers to be added to the field.</p>
    <p>“The con­di­tions of the quar­an­tine will be the same (as Mel­bourne),” said Ti­ley, with play­ers al­lowed out of their rooms for only five hours to prac­tise and train in a bio-se­cure bub­ble.</p>
    <p>“They’ll be in a dif­fer­ent ho­tel and a smaller co­hort and travel di­rect to Ade­laide. We think this is a great op­por­tu­nity to launch be­fore we go into the sea­son.”</p>
    <p>They would then head to Mel­bourne Park for the 12-team ATP Cup, along with two WTA tour­na­ments and two ATP events be­ing played from Jan 31 ahead of the Aus­tralian Open on Feb 8.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers also an­nounced an ex­tra WTA 500 tour­na­ment in Ade­laide af­ter the Aus­tralian Open, from Feb 22-27, with 70 play­ers tak­ing part.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese two tour­na­ments are a real coup for South Aus­tralia,” Mar­shall said in a news re­lease.</p>
    <p>“This is a real show of sup­port for the way that South Aus­tralia has man­aged the Covid-19 pan­demic and un­der­lines our abil­ity to at­tract world-class events.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, France’s Jeremy Chardy, ranked 72nd in the world, was not happy with the de­ci­sion on the Ade­laide tour­na­ment and feared that top play­ers iso­lat­ing in the city would ben­e­fit from ex­tra priv­i­leges.</p>
    <p>The Syd­ney Morn­ing Her­ald said the Ade­laide ho­tel, with gym fa­cil­i­ties, would of­fer much bet­ter ac­com­mo­da­tion for the play­ers than those on of­fer in Mel­bourne.</p>
    <p>“This an­nounce­ment for the top threes is a bit out of the blue, and it’s weird, to put it mildly,” he told L’Equipe.</p>
    <p>“They will even be able to ben­e­fit from a gym at the ho­tel and will be able to do their ex­er­cises, which will not count to­wards the five-hour quota.”</p>
