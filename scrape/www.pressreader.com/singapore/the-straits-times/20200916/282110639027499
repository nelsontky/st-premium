    <p>Just a week be­fore her A-level ex­am­i­na­tions be­gan, Ms Faith See lost a close church friend to a med­i­cal com­pli­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>He had un­der­gone surgery for a pre-ex­ist­ing con­di­tion, and while the op­er­a­tion went well, com­pli­ca­tions arose days later.</p>
    <p>“I was telling my­self that I had to study since the ex­ams were com­ing, but I was just go­ing through the mo­tions. I couldn’t focus, but I had no choice. And I kept think­ing that there was more to life than study­ing be­cause life is so short and you never know what will hap­pen,” said the for­mer An­glo-Chi­nese Ju­nior Col­lege stu­dent.</p>
    <p>Her even­tual re­sults were “not that bad”, she said, and she man­aged to se­cure a place in the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy and De­sign (SUTD), where she pur­sued in­for­ma­tion sys­tems tech­nol­ogy and de­sign.</p>
    <p>She said her Chris­tian faith, fam­ily and friends, as well as help from med­i­cal pro­fes­sion­als, got her through the dif­fi­cult pe­riod of grief.</p>
    <p>Ms See, 22, is one of 475 stu­dents who grad­u­ated from the univer­sity this month.</p>
    <p>They are the sixth batch of grad­u­ates, and 53 per cent of them have ei­ther se­cured jobs or will be work­ing on their own start-ups, SUTD said. An­other 20 per cent plan to pur­sue grad­u­ate stud­ies. It added that the top hir­ing sec­tors in­clude in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tion, busi­ness and man­age­ment consultanc­y, fi­nance and in­sur­ance, and re­search and de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Ms See has joined DBS Bank’s grad­u­ate as­so­ci­ate pro­gramme, known as the Skill Enhancemen­t Ed­u­ca­tion and De­vel­op­ment (Seed) pro­gramme. She se­cured the po­si­tion in Oc­to­ber last year be­fore the</p>
    <p>Covid-19 pan­demic hit.</p>
    <p>She is cur­rently a cy­ber-se­cu­rity en­gi­neer, al­though she can ex­plore other roles in ro­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>She has been in­ter­ested in cy­ber se­cu­rity ever since she watched Zero Days, a doc­u­men­tary on a cy­ber weapon, in ju­nior col­lege.</p>
    <p>“Cy­ber hy­giene is some­thing that many peo­ple don’t seem to have a con­cept of. It could be sim­ple things but they get over­looked eas­ily so I wanted to fig­ure out a way to make this more ac­ces­si­ble to the com­mu­nity,” she said.</p>
    <p>She also cited an in­ci­dent in which her grand­mother fell vic­tim to a scam call. “I want tech­nol­ogy to be a safe space for peo­ple,” said Ms See.</p>
    <p>An­other grad­u­ate, Mr Safafisala­m Bo­hari Jaon, who stud­ied engi­neer­ing sys­tems and de­sign, man­aged to get a place in March in a grad­u­ate pro­gramme with in­sur­ance provider FWD, where he will have a hand in its dig­i­tal strat­egy.</p>
    <p>“I was lucky to se­cure the po­si­tion right be­fore the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod in April, so the pan­demic didn’t af­fect my job search,” said the 24-year-old, adding that many of his friends, both from SUTD and other uni­ver­si­ties, are still look­ing for jobs and trainee­ship op­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Safafisala­m, who stud­ied in Raf­fles In­sti­tu­tion, said that giv­ing back to the com­mu­nity is some­thing he feels strongly about. He said: “Since I was in ju­nior col­lege, I thought that vol­un­teer­ing was just some­thing that peo­ple did to boost their re­sume. I gave that as a con­ve­nient ex­cuse for not do­ing it.</p>
    <p>“But this year, I started do­ing a lit­tle self-re­flec­tion. I was think­ing that I’m priv­i­leged to be study­ing in a univer­sity and when I grad­u­ate, I will be giv­ing back to Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“I re­alised I was not do­ing any­thing di­rectly as a com­mu­nity mem­ber, and I de­cided to change that this year.”</p>
    <p>He has signed up for a youth men­tor­ship pro­gramme with self-help group Yayasan Men­daki, to pro­vide a lis­ten­ing ear and be a role model to two stu­dents from the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
