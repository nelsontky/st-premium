    <p>Nurs­ing di­rec­tor Chin Soh Mun has pretty much seen it all in her 48 years in the pro­fes­sion, in roles rang­ing from acute to long-term care, but she has now found her true call­ing – pal­lia­tive care at the Dover Park Hos­pice.</p>
    <p>Ms Chin, 66, is a fer­vent be­liever that no one should be alone in their last mo­ments, so her com­mit­ment to her pa­tients goes be­yond at­tend­ing to their phys­i­cal needs.</p>
    <p>“It is about en­sur­ing that their psy­cho-social and emo­tional needs are met, which re­quires a lot of ex­pe­ri­ence and heart in the work (that we do), so it is cru­cial that we un­der­stand our pa­tients be­yond their ill­nesses,” said Ms Chin.</p>
    <p>She takes time to un­der­stand her pa­tients as people – know­ing the im­por­tant mile­stones in their lives and their family dy­nam­ics – so that their last wishes can be ful­filled and they die in peace.</p>
    <p>De­spite the in­tense emo­tional de­mands of her day job, she goes even fur­ther by vol­un­teer­ing with the Dover Park Hos­pice’s Vigil Pro­gramme, where she pro­vides so­lace and com­fort to pa­tients in their fi­nal mo­ments.</p>
    <p>Vol­un­teers are sched­uled to sit with the pa­tient day and night prior to their death.</p>
    <p>“I strongly be­lieve that no one should die alone, so I vol­un­teered to ac­com­pany these pa­tients – who are either alone or their loved ones are un­able to be with them in their fi­nal hours,” she said.</p>
    <p>An­other role in­volves over­see­ing plans to shift the hos­pice to the In­te­grated Care Hub at Health City Novena, which is ex­pected to open next year.</p>
    <p>The shift will in­crease the hos­pice’s bed num­bers from 50 to 100.</p>
    <p>Ms Chin said: “Hav­ing started my ca­reer as a nurse in the pae­di­atric ward dur­ing my train­ing days and tran­si­tion­ing to a re­struc­tured hos­pi­tal en­vi­ron­ment be­fore mov­ing into com­mu­nity nurs­ing, my last eight years in pal­lia­tive nurs­ing has been an es­pe­cially mean­ing­ful part of my ca­reer.</p>
    <p>“It’s as though I have com­pleted my jour­ney through var­i­ous phases of life to­gether with my pa­tients.”</p>
