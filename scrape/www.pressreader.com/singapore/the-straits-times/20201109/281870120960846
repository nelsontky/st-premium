    <p>The par­lia­men­tary de­bate on the Parti Liyani case last week went far beyond a sin­gle and ap­par­ently sim­ple mat­ter of al­leged house­hold theft. Its im­por­tance lay in the way in which the dis­cus­sion in­voked and clar­i­fied the very role of the rule of law here. Hav­ing the mat­ter dis­cussed in the House fol­lowed on­line and off­line chat­ter, in­formed or not, over whether a well-placed in­di­vid­ual was able to in­flu­ence the way in which the case against his In­done­sian do­mes­tic helper was in­ves­ti­gated and con­sid­ered for pros­e­cu­tion. The air­ing of views dur­ing a marathon de­bate pro­vided an op­por­tu­nity for those on both sides of the House to scru­ti­nise and raise im­por­tant, some­times dif­fi­cult ques­tions about the sys­tem of jus­tice here. Par­lia­ment ul­ti­mately en­dorsed the ro­bust­ness of the sys­tem, but also recog­nised the im­por­tance of con­stantly im­prov­ing it.</p>
    <p>The Parti Liyani case has en­tered the an­nals of par­lia­men­tary his­tory – and for the good of Sin­ga­pore. That is be­cause no ju­di­cial sys­tem can stand if jus­tice is not im­parted to all with­out re­gard for their so­cial sta­tus, eth­nic­ity, na­tion­al­ity, age, gen­der or sex­ual ori­en­ta­tion. Jus­tice must be blind for the truth to be seen. The case re­volved on two crit­i­cal points: whether there were hu­man lapses in the han­dling of the case and whether that han­dling re­flected in­her­ent and struc­tural de­fi­cien­cies in the crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem it­self. Par­lia­ment heard that in­ter­nal re­views by the po­lice and the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC) found lapses in some as­pects of how the case was han­dled, but also con­firmed there was no im­proper in­flu­ence at any point. There was no sign that her for­mer em­ployer or any­one from his fam­ily lob­bied or ex­erted pres­sure on the po­lice, deputy pub­lic pros­e­cu­tors or trial judge. As for lapses, how­ever, dis­ci­plinary ac­tion is be­ing taken against a po­lice of­fi­cer and his su­per­vi­sor.</p>
    <p>As im­por­tant is that the AGC is act­ing on or will se­ri­ously con­sider in­ves­ti­gat­ing al­le­ga­tions of per­jury or other se­ri­ous of­fences should such find­ings arise in court-is­sued judg­ments or de­ci­sions in le­gal pro­ceed­ings. In­deed, a man in­volved with the case has been charged with giv­ing false in­for­ma­tion to a pub­lic ser­vant and been ac­cused of giv­ing false ev­i­dence dur­ing a ju­di­cial pro­ceed­ing. This again in­di­cates the se­ri­ous­ness with which the au­thor­i­ties take their re­spon­si­bil­ity as im­par­tial ar­biters in the af­fairs of cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>That a guilty ver­dict was over­turned on ap­peal re­flected the no­tion that there is equal­ity be­fore the law. That would not have been the case had wealth, power and in­flu­ence been able to skew the ju­di­cial process. The im­por­tant thing now is to move for­ward: Take stock of learn­ing points, ideas and sug­ges­tions and work to en­sure that the sys­tem of jus­tice and its at­ten­dant pro­cesses are con­tin­u­ally improved to stay rel­e­vant with how so­ci­ety and the times evolve.</p>
