    <p>LON­DON • Britain’s Marks & Spencer (M&S) re­ported the first loss in its 94 years as a pub­licly listed com­pany after cloth­ing sales were ham­mered by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>One of the best-known names in Bri­tish re­tail said yes­ter­day that it made a pre-tax loss be­fore one-off items of £17.4 mil­lion (S$30.8 mil­lion) in the 26 weeks to Sept 26 – its first loss since list­ing its shares on the stock mar­ket in 1926.</p>
    <p>The out­come was ahead of an­a­lysts’ av­er­age fore­cast of a £59 mil­lion loss and com­pared with a profit of £176 mil­lion in the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Cloth­ing and home­ware sales fell 21.3 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter after a first-quar­ter de­cline of 61.5 per cent, dam­aged by a three-month coro­n­avirus lock­down in the spring and the im­pact of the pan­demic on cus­tomer de­mand.</p>
    <p>All cloth­ing re­tail­ers have been hit hard by the coro­n­avirus cri­sis. On Tues­day, Pri­mark re­ported a 63 per cent fall in an­nual profit and Next last week fore­cast a 50 per cent de­cline.</p>
    <p>M&S re­ported first-half food sales were up 2.7 per cent on a like-for-like ba­sis, with weak per­for­mances from stores in city cen­tres and trans­port hubs be­cause of the gov­ern­ment’s work-from-home di­rec­tive, off­set by a bet­ter showing from sub­ur­ban stores.</p>
    <p>The busi­ness has also ben­e­fited from a tie-up with Ocado, giv­ing the M&S food op­er­a­tion an on­line pres­ence for the first time.</p>
    <p>M&S, whose shares have fallen 57 per cent this year, said trad­ing in the first four weeks of the sec­ond half con­tin­ued at sim­i­lar rates to the end of the sec­ond quar­ter, with cloth­ing and home­ware rev­enue down 21.5 per cent, food rev­enue up 3 per cent and in­ter­na­tional rev­enue up 7.4 per cent.</p>
    <p>The group cau­tioned that Eng­land’s new four-week lock­down, be­gin­ning to­day, will hit cloth­ing and home­ware store sales and profit.</p>
