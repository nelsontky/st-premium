    <p>Stu­dents here have taken the top spot in math­e­mat­ics and sci­ence for the sec­ond con­sec­u­tive edi­tion of an in­ter­na­tional study at the Pri­mary 4 and Sec­ondary 2 lev­els.</p>
    <p>Re­sults for the 2019 edi­tion of the Trends in In­ter­na­tional Math­e­mat­ics and Sci­ence Study (Timss) were re­leased yes­ter­day. At both lev­els and for both sub­jects, Sin­ga­pore stu­dents came out on top, beat­ing stu­dents from other East</p>
    <p>Asian ter­ri­to­ries.</p>
    <p>This is the third time stu­dents here have topped the charts across all cat­e­gories in the study since its in­cep­tion in 1995, with the other two sweeps com­ing in the 2015 and 2003 stud­ies.</p>
    <p>The 2019 study in­cluded 72 ed­u­ca­tion sys­tems, with Sin­ga­pore rep­re­sented by about 10,800 par­tic­i­pants, said the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE).</p>
    <p>Stu­dents from China – who placed first in the lat­est Pro­gramme for In­ter­na­tional Stu­dent As­sess­ment (Pisa) study in 2018 ahead of Sin­ga­pore stu­dents – were not part of the Timss study.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore was the only ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem where more than half the stu­dents achieved scores of at least 625 for math­e­mat­ics at both lev­els, the cut-off score for the high­est tier – the “ad­vanced” bench­mark – on Timss’ four-tier band­ing sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents here meet­ing the “ad­vanced” bench­mark for sci­ence also trumped the global av­er­age, with 38 per cent of Pri­mary 4 pupils mak­ing the grade, com­pared with the global me­dian of 6 per cent. The fig­ures were 48 per cent and 7 per cent re­spec­tively for Sec 2 stu­dents.</p>
    <p>The per­for­mance of Sec 2 stu­dents in sci­ence was Sin­ga­pore’s best show­ing in a Timss study, with a mean score of 608.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, be­tween 1 per cent and 2 per cent of stu­dents tested did not meet the “low” band across both sub­jects, com­pared with the global me­dian of be­tween 8 per cent and 15 per cent, de­pend­ing on the sub­ject and grade.</p>
    <p>De­spite the good show­ing, only about two in 10 Pri­mary 4 pupils here and about one in 10 Sec 2 stu­dents re­ported be­ing very con­fi­dent in learn­ing maths, com­pared with global fig­ures of three in 10 and two in 10 re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, for sci­ence, about two in 10 Pri­mary 4 and Sec 2 stu­dents re­ported be­ing very con­fi­dent in learn­ing the sub­ject, com­pared with about four in 10 and two in 10 re­spec­tively around the globe.</p>
    <p>MOE said this self-re­ported lack of con­fi­dence “is sim­i­larly ob­served in other Asian ed­u­ca­tion sys­tems, and could be re­lated to the cul­tures of these sys­tems”.</p>
    <p>It added that it “will con­tinue to work closely with par­ents and other stake­hold­ers to help our stu­dents learn deeply, while fos­ter­ing a stronger sense of con­fi­dence so that they can en­joy learn­ing and main­tain a strong de­sire to learn”.</p>
    <p>MOE also said the study showed stu­dents here who are aca­dem­i­cally weaker achieved scores that are among the high­est across all par­tic­i­pat­ing sys­tems.</p>
    <p>Ms Anna Koh, a mas­ter teacher in bi­ol­ogy at MOE’s Academy of Sin­ga­pore Teach­ers, said: “We be­lieve that ev­ery child can and wants to learn, and teach­ers here are equipped with the knowl­edge and skills to iden­tify the learn­ing needs of stu­dents who may not be pro­gress­ing at the same pace.</p>
    <p>“Teach­ers dif­fer­en­ti­ate their in­struc­tion so that aca­dem­i­cally weaker stu­dents are given the guid­ance and sup­port they need, in­clud­ing ap­pro­pri­ate pitch­ing and pac­ing in the learn­ing of the con­tent, to en­sure all stu­dents learn and are kept up to speed,” she added.</p>
    <p>MOE said it will con­tinue to help stu­dents across all aca­demic abil­i­ties achieve “as high a level as they are ca­pa­ble of”.</p>
