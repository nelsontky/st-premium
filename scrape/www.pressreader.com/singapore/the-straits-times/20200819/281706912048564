    <p>ALOR SE­TAR • Kedah has ramped up re­stric­tions in ar­eas where Covid-19 cases have been de­tected in the north­ern Malaysian state, with these re­stric­tions tak­ing ef­fect im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>The state’s Men­teri Be­sar Muham­mad Sanusi Md Nor said din­ing-in would no longer be al­lowed at eater­ies in Tawar, Bal­ing, Kuala Muda and Sala dis­tricts and sev­eral lo­ca­tions in Yan.</p>
    <p>These eater­ies would be al­lowed to only de­liver food to homes and of­fer take­aways.</p>
    <p>Mr Sanusi said oper­at­ing hours for night mar­kets would be lim­ited from 4pm to 8pm; while gro­ceries, sundry shops, and 24-hour con­ve­nience stores would be al­lowed to op­er­ate from 8am to 8pm.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic parks in the af­fected dis­tricts would also be closed.</p>
    <p>He said the new guide­lines were de­cided at the state’s Se­cu­rity Work­ing Com­mit­tee meet­ing chaired by him on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>“The or­der only ap­plies to places at risk where pos­i­tive cases have been recorded.</p>
    <p>Kedah has been record­ing a ris­ing num­ber of cases in re­cent weeks, with the fed­eral Health Min­istry reporting 65 ac­tive cases on Mon­day, up six from Sun­day, ac­cord­ing to Malaysi­akini’s com­pi­la­tion of Covid-19 data.</p>
    <p>With 65 cases, Kedah has the high­est num­ber of ac­tive cases among Malaysia’s 13 states and three fed­eral ter­ri­to­ries in­clud­ing Kuala Lumpur. The state with the next big­gest num­ber of ac­tive cases is Sabah with 16.</p>
    <p>Four ac­tive clus­ters of Covid-19 have been de­tected in Kedah, namely Si­va­gangga, Tawar, Muda and Sala.</p>
    <p>The chief min­is­ter said all so­cial pro­grammes, in­clud­ing those planned by gov­ern­ment agencies, would be post­poned.</p>
    <p>“Any form of cel­e­bra­tion cer­e­monies, in­clud­ing wed­dings, will need to be put on hold,” he said. “Any mosque or re­li­gious in­sti­tu­tion with Covid-19 pos­i­tive cases are or­dered to close im­me­di­ately to en­able sani­ti­sa­tion and be fur­ther mon­i­tored.”</p>
    <p>Kedah has al­ready an­nounced the can­cel­la­tion of state-level Na­tional Day pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>Places of in­ter­est that are usu­ally crowded for the cel­e­bra­tions, such as the beaches at Pan­tai Merdeka and Pu­lau Sayak, will also be closed from Aug 28. Malaysia will cel­e­brate its 63rd year of in­de­pen­dence on Aug 31.</p>
