    <p>The grand dame of depart­ment stores, Robin­son & Com­pany, is heav­ing her last breath af­ter 162 years of ex­u­ber­ance, drama, tragedy, some suc­cesses and more than a fair share of fail­ures.</p>
    <p>Al­though most peo­ple had some inkling that there were signs of trou­ble when the Jem store closed in Au­gust, Sin­ga­pore­ans young and old, ex­pa­tri­ates, for­eign­ers and ne­ti­zens were nev­er­the­less shell-shocked at the sud­den an­nounce­ment on Fri­day that the re­main­ing stores at The Heeren and Raffles City Shop­ping Cen­tre would also be shut­tered soon.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion on every­one’s minds: How could this hap­pen to</p>
    <p>Robin­sons, a Sin­ga­pore re­tail gi­ant since 1858?</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to his­to­rian and an­thro­pol­o­gist Ju­lian Dav­i­son, Robin­sons’ brand was ini­tially suc­cess­ful be­cause of a sim­ple for­mula that was steeped in the Bri­tish colo­nial era’s ideal of what a depart­ment store should be.</p>
    <p>He says: “Robin­sons was among the first in the re­gion to repli­cate the ‘grand Vic­to­rian shop­ping ex­pe­ri­ence’ of the late 1800s, tak­ing care­ful notes from Lon­don’s Har­vey Ni­chols, Har­rods and Sel­fridges whose pala­tial re­tail premises date from the mid-1880s through to 1909.</p>
    <p>“For in­stance, when Sel­fridges opened in Lon­don in 1909, it of­fered cus­tomers a hun­dred de­part­ments in­clud­ing restau­rants, a roof gar­den and re­cep­tion ar­eas for for­eign vis­i­tors and at­ten­tive, well-versed as­sis­tants who helped cus­tomers nav­i­gate the store with ease.”</p>
    <p>Robin­son & Co was es­tab­lished on Feb 25, 1858, by Aus­tralian Phillip Robin­son and his part­ner</p>
    <p>James Ga­bo­riau Spicer, who was a for­mer keeper of the Sin­ga­pore jail, and a part­ner in the ship­build­ing busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The com­pany was then known as Spicer and Robin­son and it was lo­cated at the for­mer Com­mer­cial Square, now Raffles Place. Less than two years af­ter the part­ner­ship, Mr Spicer pulled out, and the com­pany was re­named Robin­son & Co.</p>
    <p>Dr Dav­i­son, 64, says: “Mr Robin­son de­vel­oped his busi­ness in a dif­fer­ent way. He em­ployed trav­el­ling rep­re­sen­ta­tives to can­vass through­out the Malay Ar­chi­pel­ago and Bor­neo. Many of the Malay rulers were among his cus­tomers, as well as King Mongkut of Siam.”</p>
    <p>Over the years since the late 1800s, Robin­son & Co had hits, such as ac­quir­ing John Lit­tle depart­ment store which was es­tab­lished in 1842, as well as sev­eral misses.</p>
    <p>Some of the on­slaughts the icon en­dured in­cluded yearly losses un­til 1936 due to the Great</p>
    <p>De­pres­sion, be­ing bombed dur­ing World War II and be­ing razed to the ground in 1972 af­ter a mas­sive fire.</p>
    <p>I vividly re­mem­ber step­ping into the Raffles Place store for the</p>
    <p>first time as a child dur­ing my pri­mary school hol­i­days in 1970, just be­fore the build­ing was gut­ted two years later. It was a few weeks be­fore Christ­mas, and my Hindu fam­ily wanted to join in the</p>
    <p>fes­tiv­i­ties of our Chris­tian friends.</p>
    <p>Like many other fam­i­lies, we wanted to soak in the fairy lights and Christ­mas trees at the Raffles Place store, which by the late 1960s had cap­tured the</p>
    <p>imag­i­na­tion of every­one we knew with its sales and year-end in-store events. It was so pop­u­lar that its name was bor­rowed for an­other re­tail out­let: Sungei Road.</p>
    <p>Called Robin­son Pe­tang, or “twi­light ver­sion of Robin­sons” in Malay, Sungei Road was the “thieves’ mar­ket” of Sin­ga­pore with its makeshift stalls sell­ing sec­ond-hand goods of du­bi­ous prove­nance.</p>
    <p>For the mem­bers of my fam­ily, De­cem­ber had also be­come spe­cial be­cause there was a long­ing dur­ing the year-end hol­i­days that could only be sated by shop­ping at Robin­sons and stand­ing in awe of a mind-numb­ing range of jew­ellery, hab­er­dash­ery, clothes, clocks, con­fetti, Christ­mas col­lecta­bles and what-have-you.</p>
    <p>Robin­sons at Raffles Place was like noth­ing we had ever seen in the city.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing its facelift af­ter be­ing bombed re­peat­edly, the depart­ment store was rav­en­ous for busi­ness with a stun­ning re­vamped fa­cade in 1957 and was also the first build­ing in the re­gion to be fully air-con­di­tioned.</p>
    <p>Look­ing back, I can only de­scribe the heady ex­pe­ri­ence of shop­ping at Robin­sons as a form of “magic re­al­ism” where, like the lit­er­ary genre, one gawps at a world where fan­tasy and re­al­ity col­lide, where the heav­enly and the mun­dane meet and one leaves the premises ut­terly sat­is­fied, even when the hours were whit­tled away win­dow-shop­ping.</p>
    <p>The whole she­bang was noth­ing close to what re­tail pro­fes­sion­als are try­ing to achieve to­day through the UX/UI (user ex­pe­ri­ence and user in­ter­face) of an on­line store or through aug­mented re­al­ity.</p>
    <p>The Robin­sons re­tail ex­pe­ri­ence was in an en­tirely dif­fer­ent league.</p>
    <p>It was a sub­stan­tive bricks-and-mor­tar of­fer­ing that pro­vided both an as­sault on the senses as well as an out­let from the rigours of work, school or kitchen chores.</p>
    <p>Per­anakan scholar and au­thor Peter Lee be­lieves that Sin­ga­pore’s stature as a boom­ing port city in the 1900s with a dy­namic mul­ti­cul­tural com­mu­nity also greatly helped the store re­fine its bricks-and-mor­tar shop­ping ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>“Robin­son & Co im­ported a range of bet­ter-qual­ity Euro­pean goods that every­one who could af­ford them wanted, and its his­tory is al­most as old as iconic stores like Har­rods,” says Mr Lee, 57, who cu­rated the Asian Civil­i­sa­tions Mu­seum’s Port</p>
    <p>Cities ex­hi­bi­tion in 2016, which fea­tured ex­hibits from var­ied com­mu­ni­ties in Asia’s ma­jor port cities.</p>
    <p>“We of­ten for­get how linked Sin­ga­pore has al­ways been to the global econ­omy, how mod­ern it has al­ways been, and how res­i­dents of all na­tion­al­i­ties bought and con­sumed goods from ev­ery­where,” he adds.</p>
    <p>“The Sin­ga­pore home has al­ways been more global than any­where else.”</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic may have helped pen the fi­nal chap­ter for this re­tail store, but the beloved story of Robin­sons, a true home-grown icon, is inked in mem­ory for all time.</p>
