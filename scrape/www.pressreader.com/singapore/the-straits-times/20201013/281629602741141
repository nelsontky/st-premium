    <p>Phones have been ring­ing off the hook at the of­fices of Gent­ing Cruise Lines, with the com­pany re­ceiv­ing more than 6,000 book­ings for its “cruises to nowhere” in just five days.</p>
    <p>Each of these book­ings is likely for at least two peo­ple. A to­tal of 23 Gent­ing Cruise Lines sail­ings, each with a max­i­mum ca­pac­ity of 1,700 pas­sen­gers, are sched­uled for next month and De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) an­nounced last Thurs­day that round-trip cruises with­out ports of call will take place un­der a pi­lot pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Un­der it, only two cruise lines – Gent­ing Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean In­ter­na­tional – can take to the seas.</p>
    <p>With­out dis­clos­ing spe­cific numbers, Royal Caribbean In­ter­na­tional also said that the de­mand has “ex­ceeded ex­pec­ta­tions”.</p>
    <p>A spokesman said book­ings are up 500 per cent com­pared with the past two weeks. Its first sail­ing on Dec 1, which is capped at about 1,000 guests, is al­most sold out.</p>
    <p>Cruises have been sus­pended since March due to the coro­n­avirus out­break, with the au­thor­i­ties recog­nis­ing that the prox­im­ity of guests could turn the ships into in­fec­tion clus­ters.</p>
    <p>But with the num­ber of lo­cal in­fec­tions dwin­dling, com­pa­nies have been work­ing with the au­thor­i­ties to find ways to re­gain their rev­enue stream af­ter the tourism in­dus­try took a mas­sive hit from pro­longed mea­sures to curb the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mr Michael Goh, head of in­ter­na­tional sales at Gent­ing Cruise Lines, said calls of in­quiry be­gan flood­ing in al­most im­me­di­ately af­ter the STB made its an­nounce­ment.</p>
    <p>He told The Straits Times yes­ter­day: “The re­sponse has been over­whelm­ing. We call it a ‘su­per­stay­ca­tion’, be­cause we of­fer all three meals, out­door ac­tiv­i­ties like wa­ter­slides and rock climb­ing, and even a Christmas mu­si­cal.</p>
    <p>“It is a com­plete hol­i­day ex­pe­ri­ence. The ship it­self is the des­ti­na­tion.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter Covid-19 spread in mi­grant worker dor­mi­to­ries, two of Gent­ing Cruise Lines’ ships were used as ded­i­cated quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh said this was a bless­ing in dis­guise, as it al­lowed the com­pany to “gain a lot of knowl­edge” and use “what we have learnt and ap­ply it to our op­er­a­tions”.</p>
    <p>Ms Angie Stephen, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Royal Caribbean’s op­er­a­tions in Asia-Pa­cific, at­trib­uted the surge in book­ings to the “pent-up de­sire to travel”.</p>
    <p>She said the four-night cruise sail­ing ev­ery Thurs­day evening is par­tic­u­larly at­trac­tive, as guests need to take only a day off from work on Fri­day to en­joy a long week­end on the cruise.</p>
    <p>Start­ing prices for both com­pa­nies’ of­fer­ings range be­tween $359 and $599 per per­son.</p>
    <p>On board, safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures will ap­ply and face masks are to be worn at all times by those who are not din­ing.</p>
    <p>Pas­sen­gers will have to take a manda­tory swab test be­fore they are al­lowed onto the ships.</p>
