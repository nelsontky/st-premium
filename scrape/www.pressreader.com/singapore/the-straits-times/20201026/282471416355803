    <p>For­mer phys­i­cal fitness trainer Sher­win Tang was con­duct­ing a work­out ses­sion at a gym in 2015 when all of a sud­den, he had trou­ble speak­ing in a co­her­ent man­ner.</p>
    <p>Think­ing he was tired, he de­cided to drive home to rest, but along the way, he felt a sud­den weak­ness in the right side of his body.</p>
    <p>His wife took him to Changi Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal, where they found out he was hav­ing a haem­or­rhagic stroke, which hap­pens when a blood ves­sel breaks and bleeds into the brain. The next day, he had an op­er­a­tion to re­lieve the swelling and bleed­ing in his brain.</p>
    <p>Since then, the 57-year-old has been un­able to re­call cer­tain words and of­ten strug­gles to find the right words to use in con­ver­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>He has a con­di­tion known as apha­sia. It is a com­mu­ni­ca­tion dis­or­der that re­sults from dam­age to the re­gions of the brain re­spon­si­ble for lan­guage af­ter an in­jury, most com­monly from a stroke.</p>
    <p>Ms Jamie Yin, a se­nior speech ther­a­pist at Ou­tram Com­mu­nity Hos­pi­tal, said about 30 per cent of stroke pa­tients in the hos­pi­tal have apha­sia.</p>
    <p>Those who have it have dif­fi­culty speak­ing and un­der­stand­ing speech, read­ing and writ­ing, or a com­bi­na­tion of these.</p>
    <p>Any dis­ease or dam­age to the parts of the brain that con­trol lan­guage can cause apha­sia. These in­clude brain tu­mours, trau­matic brain in­jury and de­gen­er­a­tive neu­ro­log­i­cal dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Though there are no of­fi­cial fig­ures, it is es­ti­mated that nearly 3,000 in­di­vid­u­als here are di­ag­nosed with the dis­or­der ev­ery year, ac­cord­ing to Apha­sia SG, a non­profit or­gan­i­sa­tion that sup­ports peo­ple with apha­sia and their care­givers.</p>
    <p>This num­ber is ex­pected to rise as more peo­ple fall prey to strokes, mainly be­cause of an age­ing pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Based on the Sin­ga­pore Stroke Reg­istry Re­port 2018, there were about 8,300 stroke cases ad­mit­ted to public hospi­tals here, a 5 per cent in­crease from about 7,900 cases in 2017.</p>
    <p>World Stroke Day falls on Oct 29 ev­ery year, while Speech Ther­apy Week is from Nov 2 to 8 this year.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing in short phrases, Mr Tang told The Straits Times in a video in­ter­view: “Ini­tially, I couldn’t speak at all. I used to draw things or point to ob­jects to com­mu­ni­cate.”</p>
    <p>His wife and care­giver, Madam Patricia Tan, who is an as­sis­tant teacher, said it was like “play­ing cha­rades” with him. “He was like a young child learn­ing the names of ob­jects all over again.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tang, whose right arm is still weak from the stroke, said: “I knew the words I wanted to say in my mind, but I just couldn’t seem to say them.”</p>
    <p>For two years af­ter the stroke, he vis­ited Changi Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal and St An­drew’s Com­mu­nity Hos­pi­tal for speech ther­apy and phys­io­ther­apy. Now, he prac­tises speak­ing and read­ing on his own us­ing a free apha­sia ther­apy re­source called Apha­sia Ther­apy On­line.</p>
    <p>Mr Tang, who has four chil­dren aged between 20 and 27, also uses his smart­phone to type the words he wants to con­vey when he speaks to peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Ms Kath­leen Tan, a speech ther­a­pist at the re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion de­part­ments of Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal and Jurong Com­mu­nity Hos­pi­tal, said a com­mon mis­con­cep­tion of some­one with apha­sia is that he is un­able to speak be­cause he does not know what he wants to say.</p>
    <p>She said: “A per­son with apha­sia of­ten has the same thoughts and knowl­edge that he had be­fore he de­vel­oped lan­guage dif­fi­cul­ties. He knows what he wants to com­mu­ni­cate, but has sim­ply l ost t he lan­guage abil­ity to do so.”</p>
    <p>Ms Gan Hui Hui, a prin­ci­pal speech ther­a­pist at Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal’s depart­ment of speech ther­apy, called apha­sia “an in­vis­i­ble im­pair­ment”.</p>
    <p>She said: “There are many things that hap­pen to the body af­ter a stroke, such as mus­cle weak­ness and paral­y­sis, which are more vis­i­ble com­pared with apha­sia. If one doesn’t in­ter­act with a stroke pa­tient, chances are he won’t know of such a con­di­tion.”</p>
    <p>Free­lance cre­ative de­signer Nazri Razak suf­fered a haem­or­rhagic stroke in Oc­to­ber 2018. He was un­able to speak af­ter his stroke and later found it dif­fi­cult to re­call cer­tain words as well as the names of peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The 49-year-old bach­e­lor said the re­cov­ery process was “dis­heart­en­ing”. “It made me feel like I was learn­ing a new lan­guage all over again and I felt like a child in kinder­garten.”</p>
    <p>He re­called: “I could say words like ‘water’ and ‘flow’, but I couldn’t say ‘drip­ping’, though I knew it in my mind.”</p>
    <p>He has since made much progress with the help of speech ther­apy and can now hold a con­ver­sa­tion in­de­pen­dently, though he oc­ca­sion­ally finds it dif­fi­cult to re­mem­ber some words when he is tired.</p>
    <p>A per­son with apha­sia of­ten has the same thoughts and knowl­edge that he had be­fore he de­vel­oped lan­guage dif­fi­cul­ties. He knows what he wants to com­mu­ni­cate, but has sim­ply lost the lan­guage abil­ity to do so.</p>
