    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • AirAsia Group posted its largest quar­terly loss on record as re­stric­tions im­posed by gov­ern­ments to con­tain the spread of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic dec­i­mated travel.</p>
    <p>South-east Asia’s sec­ond-big­gest bud­get car­rier by mar­ket value re­ported a net loss of RM992.9 mil­lion (S$325.4 mil­lion) in the three months ended June 30, ver­sus net in­come of RM17.3 mil­lion a year ago, ac­cord­ing to an ex­change fil­ing on Tues­day. Sales plunged 96 per cent to RM119 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive Tony Fer­nan­des has been in talks for joint ven­tures and col­lab­o­ra­tions that may re­sult in ad­di­tional in­vest­ment for the be­lea­guered air­line. Bank loans and other cap­i­tal-rais­ing pro­pos­als are also be­ing weighed.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing the lock­down, we took the op­por­tu­nity to re­struc­ture the group and lay the foun­da­tions for a sus­tain­able and vi­able busi­ness for the fu­ture,” Mr Fer­nan­des said in a state­ment on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“Al­though we do not fore­see ca­pac­ity re­turn­ing to pre-Covid-19 lev­els in the short term, we ex­pect de­mand to grad­u­ally con­tinue to grow through­out the sec­ond half of 2020 and for the air­line to be prof­itable in the years to come.”</p>
    <p>Air­lines glob­ally have grounded thou­sands of planes as coun­tries shut bor­ders and re­strict peo­ple’s move­ments.</p>
    <p>Some signs of a re­cov­ery are at least emerg­ing for re­gional avi­a­tion, with Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia agree­ing to form travel bub­bles to al­low peo­ple to move be­tween the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>AirAsia, which is based i n Malaysia, re­sumed flights in the do­mes­tic mar­ket in late April af­ter sus­pend­ing them for a month.</p>
    <p>AirAsia said in an ear­lier state­ment on Tues­day that it had “ap­plied for bank loans in our op­er­at­ing coun­tries to shore up our liq­uid­ity”.</p>
    <p>AirAsia’s au­di­tor Ernst & Young said last month that the car­rier’s abil­ity to con­tinue as a go­ing con­cern may be in sig­nif­i­cant doubt be­cause its cur­rent li­a­bil­i­ties ex­ceeded its cur­rent as­sets at the end of last year, even be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It also sounded a warn­ing on AirAsia X, the air­line’s long-haul arm.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s busi­ness op­er­a­tions have seen pos­i­tive de­vel­op­ments “as pas­sen­ger seat book­ing trends, flight fre­quen­cies and load fac­tors are grad­u­ally im­prov­ing to cater for the in­creas­ing de­mand”, AirAsia said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>As at June 30, AirAsia had RM996.1 mil­lion in cash com­pared with RM2.59 bil­lion a year ago.</p>
    <p>Some 42 per cent of the air­line’s rev­enue in the sec­ond quar­ter came from cargo and lo­gis­tics.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s SK Group said in June that it was in talks to buy a small stake in AirAsia, without pro­vid­ing fur­ther de­tails.</p>
    <p>AirAsia has also cut the salaries of man­age­ment and de­ferred plane de­liv­er­ies in an at­tempt to shave costs by 30 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>DE­MAND EX­PECTED TO GRAD­U­ALLY GROW</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the lock­down, we took the op­por­tu­nity to re­struc­ture the group and lay the foun­da­tions for a sus­tain­able and vi­able busi­ness for the fu­ture. Al­though we do not fore­see ca­pac­ity re­turn­ing to pre-Covid-19 lev­els in the short term, we ex­pect de­mand to grad­u­ally con­tinue to grow through­out the sec­ond half of 2020 and for the air­line to be prof­itable in the years to come.</p>
    <p>’’ MR TONY FER­NAN­DES, AirAsia’s chief ex­ec­u­tive.</p>
