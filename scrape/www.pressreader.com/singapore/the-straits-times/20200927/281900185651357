    <p>KAOHSIUNG • Tai­wan Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing-wen vis­ited a low-key but crit­i­cal main­te­nance base for fighter jet en­gines yes­ter­day, of­fer­ing en­cour­age­ment as the Chi­nese-claimed is­land’s armed forces come un­der strain in the face of re­peated Chi­nese air force in­cur­sions.</p>
    <p>This month alone, China’s drills have in­cluded its jets cross­ing the mid-line of the sen­si­tive Tai­wan Strait and ex­er­cis­ing near the Tai­wan-con­trolled Pratas Is­lands in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing re­gards Tai­wan as a way­ward prov­ince and has never re­nounced the use of force to bring the demo­cratic is­land un­der its con­trol.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan’s air force has re­peat­edly scram­bled to in­ter­cept Chi­nese jets. The flights have not been over the main is­land of Tai­wan it­self but have still ramped up pres­sure, both fi­nan­cial and phys­i­cal, on Tai­wan’s air force to en­sure its fighter planes are ready to go at any mo­ment.</p>
    <p>Vis­it­ing the Gang­shan air­base in south­ern Tai­wan’s Kaohsiung, Ms Tsai re­ceived a de­tailed ac­count of how the main­te­nance crew is mak­ing sure Tai­wan’s F-16 jets and other fight­ers are op­er­at­ing at peak per­for­mance. She ap­peared slightly taken aback when told the cost of one small com­po­nent for the F-CK-1 Ching-kuo Indige­nous De­fence Fighter was NT$380,000 (S$18,000).</p>
    <p>Speak­ing later to sailors at the nearby Zuoy­ing naval base, Ms Tsai promised to be the strong­est backer of the is­land’s armed forces.</p>
    <p>“If there was no backup or help from you all, the mil­i­tary’s stead­fast com­bat strength would be greatly re­duced,” she said.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan’s air force is dwarfed by China’s, and the strain of the mul­ti­ple sor­ties on the is­land’s armed forces has be­gun to show. The De­fence Min­istry this month said the “dra­matic in­crease” in the threat level, along with the air­craft be­ing “mid­dleaged”, had led to a huge in­crease in main­te­nance costs not orig­i­nally bud­geted for.</p>
    <p>Mr Saldik Fafana, 21, a trainee air force en­gi­neer at the Gang­shan base, said he had no­ticed an im­pact re­cently. “There is more work,” he told re­porters. Tai­wan is re­vamp­ing its fighter line-up.</p>
    <p>The United States last year ap­proved an US$8 bil­lion (S$11 bil­lion) sale of F-16 fighter jets to Tai­wan, a deal that would bring the is­land’s to­tal to more than 200, mak­ing it the largest F-16 fleet in Asia.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan’s De­fence Min­istry, in a re­port to Par­lia­ment last month, a copy of which was re­viewed by Reuters, said China’s flights over the nar­row strait’s mid-line were aimed at re­duc­ing Tai­wan’s re­sponse time. This has put “enor­mous pres­sure” on Tai­wan’s front-line re­spon­ders, it said.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese flights to Tai­wan’s south-west, in­clud­ing at night, are “an at­tempt to ex­haust our air de­fences”, the min­istry added, warn­ing that if th­ese be­come reg­u­lar fix­tures, they will “in­crease our bur­den of re­sponse”.</p>
