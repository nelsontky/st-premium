    <p>Sun­tec Real Es­tate In­vest­ment Trust (Sun­tec Reit)’s dis­tri­bu­tion per unit (DPU) fell by 31.3 per cent to 3.293 cents for the six months ended June 30, from 4.795 cents a year ago.</p>
    <p>This com­prises a DPU of 1.76 cents for the three months ended March 31, and a DPU of 1.533 cents for the three months ended June 30, the Reit man­ager said in a reg­u­la­tory fil­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Reit owns Sun­tec City Mall – which com­prises 813,753 sq ft of net let­table area – and cer­tain of­fice units in Sun­tec Tow­ers One, Two and Three, as well as the whole of Sun­tec Tow­ers Four and Five, which form part of an in­te­grated com­mer­cial de­vel­op­ment known as Sun­tec City.</p>
    <p>Its prop­erty port­fo­lio also com­prises 60.8 per cent ef­fec­tive in­ter­est in Sun­tec Sin­ga­pore Con­ven­tion & Ex­hi­bi­tion Cen­tre, and 141,959 sq ft of net let­table area of Sun­tec City Mall.</p>
    <p>Gross rev­enue was down 16.1 per cent to $149.4 mil­lion for the half year, from $178.1 mil­lion a year ago. This was mainly due to a drop of $14.9 mil­lion and $22.7 mil­lion in rev­enue from Sun­tec City and Sun­tec Sin­ga­pore re­spec­tively, and lower rev­enue from 177 Pa­cific High­way, a com­mer­cial build­ing in Syd­ney in which Sun­tec Reit holds a 100 per cent stake.</p>
    <p>The Reit added that the drop in rev­enue was par­tially off­set by con­tri­bu­tions from 21 Har­ris, a free­hold prop­erty in Syd­ney, and 55 Cur­rie, a free­hold of­fice build­ing in Ade­laide, which were ac­quired on April 6 and Sept 10, 2019, re­spec­tively. Sun­tec Reit owns 100 per cent in­ter­est in both prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>Net prop­erty in­come fell 20.6 per cent on the year to $91 mil­lion for the quar­ter, from $114.6 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Distributa­ble in­come de­clined 21 per cent year on year to $103.1 mil­lion, from $130.5 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The dis­tri­bu­tion of 1.533 cents per unit for the three months ended June 30 will be paid on or about Aug 27. The dis­tri­bu­tion of 1.760 cents per unit for the three months ended March 31 was paid on May 28.</p>
    <p>Mr Chong Kee Hiong, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Reit man­ager, said it had re­tained 10 per cent of the distributa­ble in­come from oper­a­tions and held back its cap­i­tal dis­tri­bu­tion in H1 to “main­tain fi­nan­cial flex­i­bil­ity in view of the evolv­ing Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>“This is to achieve bal­ance be­tween pro­vid­ing a rea­son­able re­turn to unithold­ers, build­ing cash re­serve as well as as­sist­ing our ten­ants to weather this pe­riod.”</p>
    <p>Units of Sun­tec Reit ended flat at $1.42 yes­ter­day.</p>
