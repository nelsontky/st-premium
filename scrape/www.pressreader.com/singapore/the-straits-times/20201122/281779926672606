    <p>DR NOOR FAEZZAH BAHAROM, a Sin­ga­porean who has worked on a cancer vac­cine ap­proved by the US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion and which will go into the first phase of clin­i­cal tri­als next year. |</p>
    <p>A year and a half af­ter she moved to the United States to start work on a cancer vac­cine, Dr Noor Faezzah Baharom re­ceived news that her father had been di­ag­nosed with stom­ach cancer.</p>
    <p>His bat­tle with the ail­ment and death in March this year, just more than a year af­ter his di­ag­no­sis in De­cem­ber 2018, strength­ened her re­solve to re­search and develop a cancer vac­cine in the hopes of help­ing other pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Dr Faezzah, 31, works as a post­doc­toral fel­low at the Na­tional In­sti­tutes of Health (NIH), the US govern­ment’s med­i­cal re­search agency and the largest pub­lic fun­der of biomed­i­cal re­search in the world.</p>
    <p>A cancer vac­cine she worked on was ap­proved by the US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion and will pro­ceed to the first phase of clin­i­cal tri­als, in­volv­ing a small group of head and neck cancer pa­tient vol­un­teers, in the sum­mer next year.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean was also the lead au­thor of a pa­per pub­lished in the Na­ture Im­munol­ogy sci­en­tific jour­nal on Nov 2, on im­prov­ing the ef­fi­cacy of a cancer vac­cine by de­liv­er­ing it in­tra­venously.</p>
    <p>“Los­ing my dad to cancer this year was the hard­est thing, but I can only imag­ine the pain he en­dured through all the treat­ment strate­gies. I know it’s a small step, but in my heart I be­lieve in a fu­ture where we have the best medicine for our loved ones fight­ing cancer,” Dr Faezzah wrote in a Face­book post shar­ing the pa­per.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view in Wash­ing­ton on Thurs­day, she told The Sun­day Times that her father’s di­ag­no­sis made her work on cancer im­munother­a­pies per­sonal and strength­ened her con­vic­tion to trans­late her re­search into some­thing con­crete that can help peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“When my dad had cancer, ev­ery time I went to the lab I thought, will what I do to­day help my dad? It be­came more per­sonal,” said Dr Faezzah, who has an older sis­ter and a younger brother.</p>
    <p>“What­ever I choose to do or how I spend my time hope­fully is ben­e­fi­cial to some­one,” she added.</p>
    <p>“It’s not enough to just pub­lish a pa­per. I think we need to be able to try to make it work.”</p>
    <p>“The NIH tries to trans­late (re­search) so that ev­ery­thing we do, we try to put into the clinic, which is very re­ward­ing for science, to be able to see it be help­ful in some way,” added Dr Faezzah, who be­gan her post­doc­toral work in the Mary­land fa­cil­ity in June 2017.</p>
    <p>Her in­ter­est in science be­gan with bi­ol­ogy classes in Raf­fles Ju­nior Col­lege, which led her to pur­sue a Bach­e­lor of Science in bi­o­log­i­cal sciences at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity, where she grad­u­ated with first class hon­ours.</p>
    <p>She went on to do her Doc­tor of Phi­los­o­phy in med­i­cal science at the Karolin­ska In­sti­tutet in Swe­den. There, she branched into the new and grow­ing field of us­ing im­mune sys­tems to fight cancer, which her cur­rent work fo­cuses on.</p>
    <p>“At the very ba­sic level, your im­mune sys­tem works by recog­nis­ing your­self ver­sus what’s for­eign,” she said.</p>
    <p>Based on this, cancer i mmunother­a­pies use a body’s own im­mune sys­tem to at­tack the cancer cells within it, un­like chemo­ther­apy or ra­dio­ther­apy which uses drugs or ra­di­a­tion to kill cancer cells.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can im­mu­nol­o­gist James Al­li­son jointly won a No­bel Prize in 2018 for find­ing a way to over­come the body’s nat­u­ral brakes on its own T cells so they can con­tinue to fight tu­mours in cancer pa­tients.</p>
    <p>“T cells are like the sol­diers of your im­mune sys­tem. They can fight so they can kill viruses and bac­te­ria, but they can also kill cancer cells. You want them, but in peo­ple with cancer, they get ex­hausted. What he found was a way to re­verse this ex­haus­tion,” said Dr Faezzah.</p>
    <p>“But right now, it’s like the third line of de­fence,” she added, not­ing that her father had started im­munother­apy treat­ment af­ter his chemo­ther­apy and ra­dio­ther­apy op­tions failed to work.</p>
    <p>“I think what the fu­ture is go­ing to be is that we’re go­ing to try to make that hap­pen ear­lier.”</p>
    <p>Un­like pre­ven­tive vac­cines used for in­fec­tious diseases like the flu, cancer vac­cines are used af­ter the dis­ease is found in the body.</p>
    <p>They are also per­son­alised by se­quenc­ing an in­di­vid­ual’s tu­mour and fig­ur­ing out where mu­ta­tions oc­cur – which can be dif­fer­ent in ev­ery pa­tient, un­like a virus.</p>
    <p>“Dif­fer­ent peo­ple have dif­fer­ent can­cers, ba­si­cally. So you have to se­quence ev­ery sin­gle per­son’s cancer to fig­ure out what that mu­ta­tion is,” said Dr Faezzah, who be­lieves that such a per­son­alised ap­proach is the fu­ture of medicine.</p>
    <p>She, to­gether with 19 re­searchers, also found that de­liv­er­ing cancer vac­cines in­tra­venously, rather than through in­jec­tions, im­proves their ef­fi­cacy – the topic of the Na­ture Im­munol­ogy pa­per pub­lished this month.</p>
    <p>Dr Faezzah said she had shared about her work with her father, Mr Baharom Saion, and that he had been proud of her and her work but was un­sure if it would be in time for him.</p>
    <p>“The mo­ment I found out he was sick, I went back five times in a year and a bit. I did get to spend some time with him but I still had work here,” she said.</p>
    <p>“I was think­ing about mov­ing back to Sin­ga­pore at that point but then he died so soon.</p>
    <p>“It’s very hard to re­ally know how long you have some­one when they have cancer.”</p>
    <p>She added: “It will be a cou­ple of years be­fore we see more ef­fec­tive ther­a­pies with cancer vac­cines.</p>
    <p>“We want some­thing that works con­sis­tently with more peo­ple. And I think it is... hope­fully in our life­time.”</p>
    <p>Los­ing my dad to cancer this year was the hard­est thing, but I can only imag­ine the pain he en­dured through all the treat­ment strate­gies. I know it’s a small step, but in my heart I be­lieve in a fu­ture where we have the best medicine for our loved ones fight­ing cancer. DR NOOR FAEZZAH BAHAROM ’’</p>
