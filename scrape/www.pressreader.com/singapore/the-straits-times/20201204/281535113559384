    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment has reg­is­tered its dis­ap­point­ment at a United Na­tions com­mis­sion’s re­clas­si­fi­ca­tion of cannabis as a less dan­ger­ous drug. The United Na­tions Com­mis­sion on Nar­cotic Drugs voted on Wed­nes­day to re­move cannabis for medic­i­nal pur­poses from a cat­e­gory of the world’s most dan­ger­ous drugs.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment has reg­is­tered its dis­ap­point­ment at a United Na­tions com­mis­sion’s re­clas­si­fi­ca­tion of cannabis as a less dan­ger­ous drug, say­ing this could fuel the wrong per­cep­tion that it is less harm­ful than be­fore.</p>
    <p>The state­ment is­sued by the Min­istry of Home Af­fairs (MHA) yes­ter­day came af­ter the United Na­tions Com­mis­sion on Nar­cotic Drugs, the main drug pol­i­cy­mak­ing body of the UN, voted on Wed­nes­day to re­move cannabis for medic­i­nal pur­poses from a cat­e­gory of the world’s most dan­ger­ous drugs.</p>
    <p>The 53 mem­ber states of the com­mis­sion had voted to ac­cept one of six rec­om­men­da­tions on cannabis and cannabis-re­lated sub­stances put for­ward by the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion Ex­pert Com­mit­tee on Drug De­pen­dence. The other five rec­om­men­da­tions were re­jected.</p>
    <p>The rec­om­men­da­tion, which re­quired a sim­ple ma­jor­ity to pass, was voted for by 27 mem­ber states, with 25 vot­ing against it and one mem­ber ab­stain­ing.</p>
    <p>In ex­press­ing its dis­ap­point­ment with the out­come, MHA said: “There is no strong ev­i­dence to sup­port the rec­om­men­da­tions, in­clud­ing Rec­om­men­da­tion 5.1.”</p>
    <p>The ac­cep­tance of the rec­om­men­da­tion means that cannabis and cannabis resin would no longer be listed with the most dan­ger­ous drugs, such as heroin, in Sched­ule IV un­der the Sin­gle Con­ven­tion on Nar­cotic Drugs of 1961, although in­ter­na­tional con­trol mea­sures for them re­main un­changed.</p>
    <p>Sched­ule IV lists the most dan­ger­ous sub­stances that are highly ad­dic­tive, li­able to abuse and rarely used in med­i­cal prac­tice. The Con­ven­tion al­lows coun­tries to im­pose con­di­tions on such drugs, ex­cept for the amounts needed for med­i­cal and sci­en­tific re­search.</p>
    <p>MHA said the ac­cep­tance of Rec­om­men­da­tion 5.1 could send a wrong sig­nal that the United Na­tions com­mis­sion has soft­ened its stance against cannabis and fuel pub­lic mis­per­cep­tion, es­pe­cially among the youth, that cannabis is no longer con­sid­ered to be as harm­ful as be­fore de­spite strong ev­i­dence show­ing oth­er­wise.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion will not im­pact Sin­ga­pore’s zero-tol­er­ance stance against drugs, in­clud­ing against cannabis and cannabis-re­lated sub­stances, added the min­istry. It noted that the in­ter­na­tional drug con­trol con­ven­tions al­low coun­tries the flex­i­bil­ity to adopt na­tional mea­sures that are stricter than re­quired by the con­ven­tions.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is not a vot­ing mem­ber of the com­mis­sion but has been in­volved in dis­cus­sions it held.</p>
    <p>De­liv­er­ing a state­ment at the 63rd ses­sion of the UN com­mis­sion, Sin­ga­pore’s Per­ma­nent Rep­re­sen­ta­tive to the UN in Geneva, Am­bas­sador Umej Bha­tia, re­it­er­ated the Repub­lic’s stance on this is­sue, join­ing 28 other coun­tries aligned against the rec­om­men­da­tions.</p>
    <p>Th­ese coun­tries – in­clud­ing China, Egypt, In­done­sia, Rus­sia, Sri Lanka, the Philip­pines and Turkey – agreed that ac­cep­tance of Rec­om­men­da­tion 5.1 should not be viewed as an en­dorse­ment of recre­ational cannabis nor lead to fur­ther lib­er­al­i­sa­tion of con­trols over cannabis.</p>
    <p>Mr Bha­tia said the vot­ing out­comes had demon­strated clearly that there was no in­ter­na­tional con­sen­sus on the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion ex­pert com­mit­tee’s rec­om­men­da­tions to the UN com­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>“Clearly, there is a lack of ad­e­quate and ro­bust ev­i­dence to sub­stan­ti­ate th­ese rec­om­men­da­tions, par­tic­u­larly on the safety and ef­fi­cacy of cannabis and its re­lated sub­stances for med­i­cal pur­poses.”</p>
    <p>In con­trast, there i s we l l - founded and in­con­tro­vert­ible re­search that es­tab­lishes sev­eral short-term and long-term ad­verse ef­fects as­so­ci­ated with cannabis use, in­clud­ing im­pair­ments to res­pi­ra­tory and cog­ni­tive func­tions, he told the com­mis­sion in a state­ment led by Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>The WHO Ex­pert Com­mit­tee on Drug De­pen­dence con­sists of an in­de­pen­dent group of ex­perts in the field of drugs and medicine.</p>
    <p>In its state­ment, MHA said that con­trary to the WHO ex­pert com­mit­tee’s views, there are no com­pelling jus­ti­fi­ca­tions that the pro­posed reschedul­ing is re­quired to re­duce bar­ri­ers to ac­cess cannabis and its re­lated sub­stances for med­i­cal and sci­en­tific pur­poses.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent in­ter­na­tional drug con­trol sys­tem al­ready pro­vides ad­e­quate ac­cess to such stances for th­ese pur­poses, MHA added.</p>
    <p>It re­it­er­ated that Sin­ga­pore would con­tinue to en­force strict laws against the traf­fick­ing, pos­ses­sion, con­sump­tion, and im­port and ex­port of il­licit drugs, in­clud­ing cannabis, to pro­tect the health and wel­fare of its peo­ple.</p>
