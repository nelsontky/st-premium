    <p>A new jobs por­tal has been launched to link job seek­ers to both em­ploy­ment and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties, es­pe­cially in Sin­ga­pore’s grow­ing sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam said in a Face­book post yes­ter­day that the in­for­ma­tion on the por­tal – job­s­go­here.gov.sg – is tai­lored to dif­fer­ent types of job seek­ers, and it is meant to make the job-hunt­ing process as con­ve­nient as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>It caters to both fresh grad­u­ates and mid-ca­reer work­ers, who may or may not have prior ex­pe­ri­ence in a par­tic­u­lar sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Mr Thar­man noted that jobs will be the cen­tral chal­lenge of the fu­ture ev­ery­where in the world, with a real prospect of pro­longed high un­em­ploy­ment in many coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“In­comes of those in the broad mid­dle class have stag­nated in a whole range of ad­vanced economies – with a few like Swe­den and Sin­ga­pore be­ing the ex­cep­tions,” he said. “And jobs have been cre­ated mainly at the high- and low-skilled ends of the labour mar­ket – like a bar­bell struc­ture – with fewer jobs in the mid­dle.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, with Covid-19 in the pic­ture, the “bot­tom end of the bar­bell is shrink­ing” with a whole range of ser­vice tasks be­ing elim­i­nated by ecom­merce, re­mote work, and safe dis­tanc­ing guide­lines that will likely con­tinue to be in place for the next few years.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic is far from be­ing tamed, and vac­cines can­not be ex­pected to be a quick fix, he said, warn­ing of a slow and bumpy eco­nomic re­cov­ery in­ter­na­tion­ally and pos­si­ble re­peated lock­downs.</p>
    <p>“The good news: If there is one thing we’ve learnt from how Sin­ga­pore has brought down lo­cal trans­mis­sion of the virus to close to zero, it is that we will suc­ceed if we all play our part. We have to ap­ply this same ori­en­ta­tion towards jobs, and more force­fully than ever be­fore,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment and its tri­par­tite part­ners are spar­ing no ef­fort on this front, he added.</p>
    <p>While the goal is to avoid poor-fit­ting job matches as much as pos­si­ble, no job match will be per­fect, he noted. There­fore, em­ploy­ers must take re­spon­si­bil­ity and be will­ing to give op­por­tu­ni­ties to job seek­ers with­out the re­quired back­ground or qual­i­fi­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>On their part, job seek­ers must be will­ing to step into new ter­ri­tory and de­velop fur­ther on the job, he said, adding that many have done so and found sat­is­fac­tion in their new ca­reers.</p>
    <p>Mr Thar­man high­lighted bright spots in many parts of the econ­omy, in­clud­ing fi­nance, health­care, in­fo­comm tech­nol­ogy, man­u­fac­tur­ing, lo­gis­tics, pock­ets of the re­tail sec­tor and the emerg­ing green econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Shar­ing an ar­ti­cle he wrote for The Straits Times on the chal­lenges and pos­si­ble so­lu­tions in the jobs area, he noted that the prob­lems are be­com­ing en­trenched in sev­eral other ad­vanced coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“We are mak­ing a de­ter­mined ef­fort to avoid that hap­pen­ing in Sin­ga­pore,” he said. “We must be a place where ev­ery­one can adapt to new re­al­i­ties, get sup­port to keep learn­ing, see things im­prove over time, and make the most of life. I’m con­vinced we will suc­ceed.”</p>
