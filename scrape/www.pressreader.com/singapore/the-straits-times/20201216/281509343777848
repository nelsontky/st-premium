    <p>Fol­low­ing weeks of un­cer­tainty, Malaysian Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s first fed­eral bud­get – the big­gest in the coun­try’s his­tory – cleared a fi­nal hur­dle to be rat­i­fied by Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day, af­ter sur­viv­ing a par­lia­men­tary vote.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s Perikatan Na­sional (PN) govern­ment was backed by 111 MPs, com­pared with 108 MPs who voted against it, af­ter a bloc vot­ing pro­ce­dure was trig­gered by the op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>The RM322.5 bil­lion (S$106 bil­lion) bud­get will now be sent to the Up­per House – the Se­nate – to be rat­i­fied, be­fore go­ing into ef­fect.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Up­per House ap­provals are gen­er­ally a for­mal­ity in the Malaysian leg­is­la­ture.</p>
    <p>The vic­tory for Mr Muhyid­din comes on the back of re­newed doubts re­gard­ing his ma­jor­ity in the week pre­ced­ing the fi­nal bud­get vote.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this week, spec­u­la­tion was once again rife that op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim had man­aged to secure the back­ing of sev­eral govern­ment MPs from Umno to undo Mr Muhyid­din’s par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>But this was sub­se­quently de­nied by Datuk Seri An­war’s fac­tion, Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat (PKR).</p>
    <p>Mr An­war, who is PKR presi</p>
    <p>dent, has been claim­ing a par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity for the past three months.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Mr Muhyid­din’s pre­de­ces­sor, Tun Dr Ma­hathir Mo­hamad, also in­di­cated pos­si­ble fail­ure of the bud­get while an­nounc­ing that he was team­ing up with a se­nior govern­ment MP, Tan Sri Raza­leigh Hamzah, to of­fer to form a govern­ment should the bud­get fail.</p>
    <p>But Tengku Raza­leigh’s move did not ap­pear to have any bear­ing on the vot­ing pat­tern of other Umno law­mak­ers, show­ing that Mr Muhyid­din still re­tained the sup­port of at least 111 MPs in the 220-mem­ber House, fol­low­ing the death of two law­mak­ers ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>The op­po­si­tion Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) de­cided not to call for bloc vot­ing dur­ing the pol­icy-stage vote for the bud­get last month. But yes­ter­day, they chal­lenged the bud­get twice in quick suc­ces­sion through division vot­ing.</p>
    <p>PH called the bud­get a doc­u­ment that did not achieve its own ob­jec­tives, and urged even govern­ment law­mak­ers to vote it down.</p>
    <p>But on both oc­ca­sions, the out­come was the same, with the govern­ment ob­tain­ing 111 votes to the op­po­si­tion’s 108. Only one MP, Tengku Raza­leigh, was ab­sent.</p>
    <p>The vot­ing pat­tern also showed that all MPs who were present in the Lower House had voted ac­cord­ing to party lines.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Dr Ma­hathir urged law­mak­ers to vote ac­cord­ing to their con­science and not party lines. “The MPs should think about the coun­try first, not about them­selves,” he said at a joint news con­fer­ence with Tengku Raza­leigh.</p>
    <p>The bud­get vic­tory would likely so­lid­ify Mr Muhyid­din’s grip as prime min­is­ter for the im­me­di­ate fu­ture. He said the vote re­flected ac­knowl­edge­ment by MPs that the bud­get is meant to help Malaysians hit by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“The stand of the MPs... also proved that they hon­oured the call by the King for this bud­get to be passed with­out any hin­drance, es­pe­cially at a time when the coun­try is deal­ing with the Covid-19 threat,” he said on Face­book.</p>
    <p>De­spite con­stant ques­tions re­gard­ing his ma­jor­ity since as­sum­ing the post in March, Mr Muhyid­din’s govern­ment has man­aged to pass a coron­avirus re­lief Bill, and now the fed­eral bud­get, in Par­lia­ment. This is de­spite his ma­jor­ity never be­ing de­bated or put to a vote in Par­lia­ment un­til yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Numer­ous con­fi­dence and no­con­fi­dence mo­tions have been filed against the Prime Min­is­ter, but none of them have seen the light of day in Par­lia­ment, where govern­ment Bills are pri­ori­tised.</p>
    <p>This meant that the Bills in Par­lia­ment acted as a barom­e­ter of Mr Muhyid­din’s par­lia­men­tary sup­port.</p>
