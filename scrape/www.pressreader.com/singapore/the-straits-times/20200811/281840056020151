    <p>Amer­i­can sanc­tions im­posed on 11 top Hong Kong and main­land of­fi­cials ac­cel­er­ated the ar­rest of vo­cal anti-China ad­vo­cate Jimmy Lai and six oth­ers un­der the na­tional se­cu­rity law, po­lit­i­cal ob­servers said.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Al­fred Wu of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Pub­lic Pol­icy said the ar­rests come as Hong Kong is caught up in the United States-China tus­sle.</p>
    <p>“Why are they ur­gently ar­rest­ing Jimmy Lai? Be­cause he’s ask­ing for sanc­tions on China,” he said, adding that the next prob­a­ble can­di­date for ar­rest is hu­man rights ad­vo­cate Joshua Wong, who has been dis­qual­i­fied from run­ning in the Legco (Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil) elec­tion pre­vi­ously sched­uled for Sept 6.</p>
    <p>“You can see they wanted a num­ber of peo­ple, in­clud­ing the now-dis­banded De­mo­sisto’s Nathan Law, who fled to the United King­dom, and the ba­sis is col­lu­sion with the Amer­i­cans,” Prof Wu said.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong me­dia tycoon Lai, 71, is the high­est-pro­file in­di­vid­ual among the nine peo­ple ar­rested un­der the na­tional se­cu­rity law that kicked in on June 30, spark­ing world­wide crit­i­cism, in­clud­ing from the US, Bri­tain and Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>He was de­tained over sus­pected col­lu­sion with for­eign forces in a highly pub­li­cised in­ci­dent yes­ter­day, when about 200 po­lice of­fi­cers searched the of­fices of his Ap­ple Daily news­pa­per – one of the most crit­i­cal anti-es­tab­lish­ment voices in the city.</p>
    <p>Lai him­self is an ar­dent critic of Bei­jing and met US Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence and Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo in Wash­ing­ton in July last year to dis­cuss the con­tro­ver­sial and with­drawn ex­tra­di­tion Bill and the city’s sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Wong has openly pressed the US to im­pose sanc­tions on Hong Kong and main­land of­fi­cials. He also went to the US to push for pas­sage of the Hong Kong Hu­man Rights and Democ­racy Act, which was even­tu­ally passed.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said yes­ter­day that at least nine lo­cal men aged be­tween 23 and 72 had been ar­rested on sus­pi­cion of col­lu­sion with a for­eign coun­try or ex­ter­nal el­e­ments to en­dan­ger na­tional se­cu­rity, con­spir­acy to de­fraud and other of­fences.</p>
    <p>“In­ves­ti­ga­tion is still un­der way and fur­ther ar­rests may be made,” they added.</p>
    <p>Mr Lau Siu Kai, vice-pres­i­dent of the Chi­nese As­so­ci­a­tion of Hong Kong and Ma­cau Stud­ies, be­lieves the ar­rests of Lai and six oth­ers were car­ried out “in or­der to con­tain and de­ter lo­cal and for­eign hos­tile anti-China forces, as well as de­ter US in­di­vid­u­als and or­gan­i­sa­tions in Hong Kong from con­duct­ing in­ter­fer­ence ac­tiv­i­ties”.</p>
    <p>The US sanc­tions have ac­cel­er­ated Bei­jing’s move to take these pro-US hos­tile forces in Hong Kong to task, he added.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton im­posed sanc­tions late last Fri­day night on Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam and 10 other top Hong Kong and main­land of­fi­cials, in­clud­ing Hong Kong po­lice com­mis­sioner Chris Tang, his pre­de­ces­sor Stephen Lo, di­rec­tor of the new Of­fice for Safe­guard­ing Na­tional Se­cu­rity Zheng Yanxiong, as well as head of the Hong Kong and Ma­cau Af­fairs Of­fice Xia Bao­long and his deputy Zhang Xiaom­ing, for their roles in rolling out the se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>The ar­rests raise ques­tions as to whether moder­ates such as Demo­cratic Party founder Martin Lee and re­tired politi­cian An­son Chan could be next.</p>
    <p>China’s state me­dia pre­vi­ously la­belled the pair, along with Lai and former lawmaker Al­bert Ho, as the “new Gang of Four” col­lud­ing with Western forces to in­sti­gate un­rest and de­stroy the city.</p>
    <p>The Gang of Four orig­i­nally re­ferred to allies of late chair­man Mao Ze­dong who were even­tu­ally con­victed in show tri­als for “counter-rev­o­lu­tion­ary crimes”.</p>
    <p>Mrs Chan an­nounced on June 26, days be­fore the na­tional se­cu­rity law kicked in, that she would step back from civic and po­lit­i­cal en­gage­ment to lead a qui­eter life.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Sing Ming of The Hong Kong Univer­sity of Science and Tech­nol­ogy said: “The gov­ern­ment em­pha­sised again and again that the na­tional se­cu­rity law would not have any retroac­tive ef­fect, so were An­son Chan to be ar­rested, un­der­stand­ing the charge would be im­por­tant.”</p>
    <p>The other key point raised is whether Lai will be sent to the main­land for fur­ther in­ves­ti­ga­tion, said Prof Wu, who de­scribed this as “a big ques­tion mark”.</p>
    <p>So far, the po­lice have said they had ob­tained a war­rant from a Hong Kong mag­is­trate to gather ev­i­dence for of­fences re­lated to na­tional se­cu­rity.</p>
