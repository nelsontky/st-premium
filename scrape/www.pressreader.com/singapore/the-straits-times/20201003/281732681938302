    <p>WASH­ING­TON • On Mon­day, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump up­dated the na­tion on the ad­min­is­tra­tion’s coro­n­avirus test­ing strat­egy and an­nounced a plan to dis­trib­ute 150 mil­lion rapid tests. By early yes­ter­day, he had the virus him­self.</p>
    <p>On the days i n be­tween, Mr Trump in­ter­acted with scores of staff, donors and sup­port­ers. Even the woman he has nom­i­nated to the Supreme Court, Judge Amy Coney Bar­rett, has been at the White House this week.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent held prepa­ra­tion ses­sions with staff mem­bers for his de­bate on Tues­day night with for­mer vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den, in the tight quar­ters of the West Wing, where of­fi­cials who are tested reg­u­larly have re­lied on neg­a­tive re­sults as an ex­cuse to forgo masks and other safety pre­cau­tions.</p>
    <p>He at­tended a closed-door fundraiser at a pri­vate home of a wealthy sup­porter in Min­neapo­lis, and he ap­peared be­fore thou­sands of peo­ple at a rally in Du­luth, Min­nesota, where most of the crowd did not wear masks. He also shared a stage with Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>It is not yet clear when and how Mr Trump con­tracted the virus. The Pres­i­dent and the First Lady, Mrs Me­la­nia Trump, said they had both tested pos­i­tive hours af­ter one of his clos­est aides, Ms Hope Hicks, had also tested pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Ms Hicks re­ceived the di­ag­no­sis af­ter she be­gan ex­pe­ri­enc­ing symp­toms on Wed­nes­day while at­tend­ing the Pres­i­dent’s rally in Min­nesota. Mr Trump kept his ap­pear­ance there to about 45 minutes, roughly half the length of one of his typ­i­cal rally speeches.</p>
    <p>Early yes­ter­day, it was still un­clear how many other aides who had come into close con­tact with Mr Trump had tested pos­i­tive, but the White House said its med­i­cal unit was con­duct­ing con­tact trac­ing. Top ad­vis­ers to the Pres­i­dent de­scribed them­selves as in a state of shock, and said they ex­pected a num­ber of ad­di­tional cases among peo­ple in Mr Trump’s or­bit.</p>
    <p>White House of­fi­cials had hoped to keep the news about Ms Hicks from be­com­ing pub­lic, to no avail.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, for his part, has been fa­tal­is­tic when talk­ing with as­so­ciates about whether he or oth­ers would get sick, de­scrib­ing the pos­si­bil­ity as a roll of the dice.</p>
    <p>His week in­cluded a se­ries of events in which he played down the virus in front of crowds large and small, all with­out wear­ing a mask.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day in the Rose Gar­den, Mr Trump boasted about the progress he said that his ad­min­is­tra­tion had made to­wards in­creas­ing test­ing ca­pac­ity. “I say, and I will say it all the time: We are round­ing the cor­ner,” Mr Trump said.</p>
    <p>He was joined by Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence, Health Sec­re­tary Alex Azar, Education Sec­re­tary Betsy DeVos and Ab­bott Lab­o­ra­to­ries chief ex­ec­u­tive Robert Ford.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Mr Trump was ac­com­pa­nied by all of his adult chil­dren and se­nior mem­bers of his White House and cam­paign staff on Air Force One en route to Cleve­land for the first pres­i­den­tial de­bate.</p>
    <p>None of them wore masks as they were seen board­ing and de­plan­ing. Mr Bill Stepien, the Pres­i­dent’s cam­paign man­ager, was seen on board with­out a mask, and then was spot­ted get­ting into a staff van with Ms Hicks.</p>
    <p>On stage in Cleve­land, Mr Trump mocked Mr Bi­den for his habit of wear­ing a mask in pub­lic. “I think masks are okay,” Mr Trump said, adding: “I put a mask on when I think I need it. Tonight, as an ex­am­ple, ev­ery­body’s had a test and you have had so­cial dis­tanc­ing and all of the things that you have to, but I wear masks when needed.”</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent then ad­dressed Mr Bi­den, say­ing: “I don’t wear a mask like him. Ev­ery time you see him, he has got a mask. He could be speak­ing 200ft away from them and he shows up with the big­gest mask I have ever seen.”</p>
    <p>Few in the Pres­i­dent’s cir­cle ap­peared to be tak­ing any pre­cau­tions on the Cleve­land trip. Those on Air Force One on Tues­day evening in­cluded cam­paign strate­gist Jason Miller, White House pol­icy ad­viser Stephen Miller, White House chief of staff Mark Mead­ows, Na­tional Se­cu­rity Ad­viser Robert O’Brien who tested pos­i­tive for the virus in July and Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Jim Jor­dan, an Ohio Repub­li­can. All were seen on the plane with­out masks.</p>
    <p>On the flight home from the de­bate, Mr Jared Kush­ner, the Pres­i­dent’s se­nior ad­viser and son-in­law, could be seen in a staff cabin, speak­ing an­i­mat­edly to his col­leagues with no mask cov­er­ing his face. Upon land­ing at Joint Base An­drews in the mid­dle of a heavy rain­storm, Ms Lara Trump, the Pres­i­dent’s daughter-in-law, and Ms</p>
    <p>Kim­berly Guil­foyle, a se­nior cam­paign of­fi­cial and the girl­friend of Mr Don­ald Trump Jr, the Pres­i­dent’s el­dest son, hud­dled to share an um­brella as they crossed the tar­mac, talk­ing and laugh­ing. Ms Guil­foyle tested pos­i­tive for the virus in the sum­mer.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, the East Wing has taken a dif­fer­ent ap­proach to safety. Mrs Me­la­nia Trump, who posted a photograph of her­self wear­ing a mask on Twit­ter be­fore her hus­band re­luc­tantly en­dorsed the prac­tice, has made the ma­jor­ity of her staff mem­bers work from home, with aides en­ter­ing the build­ing on a ro­tat­ing ba­sis.</p>
    <p>When she has trav­elled with the Pres­i­dent, she has done so with­out mem­bers of her own advance staff to avoid ex­po­sure.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the de­bate, the Pres­i­dent’s daughter, Ms Ivanka Trump, posted a rare photograph of her­self with her mother-in-law, along with Ms Tif­fany Trump and Ms Lara Trump, hud­dled to­gether back­stage, wear­ing masks. But none of the fam­ily mem­bers wore masks in the de­bate hall.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day evening, a small co­terie of ad­vis­ers spoke with one an­other about Ms Hicks’ symp­toms as they flew home aboard Air Force One. Ms Hicks was quar­an­tined in a sep­a­rate cabin. She ex­ited from the back of the plane, as op­posed to the front.</p>
    <p>By Thurs­day, it was clear that some­thing un­usual was hap­pen­ing at the White House, aides said. Sev­eral staff mem­bers who have avoided masks were sud­denly wear­ing them. On Thurs­day evening, be­fore his own di­ag­no­sis was made pub­lic, Mr Trump sounded raspy on a call with Iowa vot­ers and in an in­ter­view later with Mr Sean Han­nity on Fox News.</p>
    <p>Some aides chalked it up to a busy week of cam­paign­ing.</p>
