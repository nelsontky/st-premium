    <p>BARCELONA • New Barcelona coach Ron­ald Koe­man is ex­pected to over­see a mas­sive over­haul of the squad as he leads them into a new era after their weak­nesses were ex­posed in the 8-2 thrash­ing by Bay­ern Mu­nich, pres­i­dent Josep Maria Bar­tomeu has said.</p>
    <p>Koe­man, one of Barca’s great­est ever play­ers who was yes­ter­day con­firmed as the club’s man­ager through 2022, will over­see the tran­si­tion along­side Ra­mon Planes, the new tech­ni­cal sec­re­tary after Eric Abidal left the club.</p>
    <p>“The tech­ni­cal sec­re­tary and new coach will take dras­tic mea­sures and they will af­fect cer­tain play­ers, who we should give a proper farewell to,” Bar­tomeu said in an interview with the club’s of­fi­cial tele­vi­sion chan­nel on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>He did not say which play­ers would de­part but re­ferred to seven play­ers who were not for sale: Cap­tain Lionel Messi, 33, goal­keeper Marc-An­dre ter Ste­gen, 28, de­fend­ers Cle­ment Len­glet, 25, and Nel­son Semedo, 26, French winger Ous­mane Dem­bele, 23, and re­cent sign­ings An­toine Griez­mann, 29, and Frenkie de Jong, 23.</p>
    <p>Ger­ard Pique, 33, and 32-yearold Ser­gio Bus­quets, who have been at the club since 2008, are the long­est-serv­ing play­ers after Messi. They were omit­ted from Bar­tomeu’s list, mean­ing they could face an exit after 12 tro­phy-laden years.</p>
    <p>Jordi Alba, 31, Ivan Rakitic, 32, and Luis Suarez, 33 – cru­cial mem­bers of the team that won the tre­ble in 2015 as well as the La Liga ti­tles in 2016, 2018 and last year – were also not men­tioned in the list.</p>
    <p>“These are play­ers who have given their best days to the club and been part of the club’s best years,” added Bar­tomeu. “Some of those de­ci­sions have al­ready been taken by oth­ers and some will be taken soon by dif­fer­ent peo­ple. The play­ers will not be con­sulted on these de­ci­sions. It’s very im­por­tant to lis­ten to opin­ions but the coach and tech­ni­cal sec­re­tary will take the de­ci­sion to­gether.”</p>
    <p>Barca will face a chal­lenge in sell­ing some play­ers due to hav­ing the big­gest wage bill in world foot­ball, at a time when clubs are fac­ing se­ri­ous fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, which has stripped them of match-day rev­enue and ticket sales.</p>
    <p>Play­ers like Alba, Bus­quets and Suarez have all in­di­cated their de­sire to stay, while per­suad­ing Messi – whose con­tract ex­pires next year – to re­main will be high on Koe­man’s to-do list.</p>
    <p>The 57-year-old, who had been in charge of the Dutch na­tional team since 2018, will also need to find a way to get the best out of his com­pa­triot de Jong. The mid­fielder starred at Ajax in the mid­dle of a 4-3-3 for­ma­tion but has of­ten been played out of po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>In his first press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, Koe­man vowed to stay true to the club’s pos­ses­sion-based style.</p>
    <p>“I’m Dutch and the Dutch like to have the ball and play well. I have ex­pe­ri­ence and I’m ready to coach Barca,” he said. “We have to look for work and en­joy. It’s the first thing I’ll tell the play­ers, they have to en­joy the foot­ball.”</p>
    <p>He is set to lead by ex­am­ple after land­ing his dream job.</p>
    <p>“To­day is a day to be happy and proud,” he said. “Every­one knows Barcelona, to me, is my home.”</p>
