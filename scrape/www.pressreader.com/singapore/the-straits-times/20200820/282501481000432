    <p>This has been take­down sum­mer for tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>In June alone, episodes of ac­claimed come­dies such as 30 Rock (2006 to 2013), It’s Al­ways Sunny In Philadel­phia (2005 to present) and Scrubs (2001 to 2010) were re­moved from Hulu, Net­flix and Ama­zon Prime Video, each for scenes fea­tur­ing white char­ac­ters wear­ing black­face; five episodes of South Park (1997 to present) that de­pict the Prophet Muham­mad were with­held from HBO Max by Com­edy Cen­tral’s par­ent com­pany, Vi­a­com; and an episode of Com­edy Cen­tral’s Worka­holics (2011 to 2017) was taken off the net­work’s web­site and stream­ing ser­vices after a guest star, comic Chris D’Elia, was ac­cused of sex­u­ally groom­ing un­der­age girls. (D’Elia has stated that all of his re­la­tion­ships were “le­gal and con­sen­sual”.)</p>
    <p>Such re­movals seem likely to con­tinue, thanks to tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vances and cul­tural shifts.</p>
    <p>As view­ers are more ag­gres­sively in­ter­ro­gat­ing is­sues of race and rep­re­sen­ta­tion and hold­ing peo­ple ac­count­able for bad be­hav­iour, vast stream­ing archives have made thou­sands of episodes from through­out TV his­tory – of­fen­sive and oth­er­wise – ac­ces­si­ble with just a few clicks.</p>
    <p>While sim­ply tak­ing down of­fen­sive con­tent might be ex­pe­di­tious for me­dia com­pa­nies, the prac­tice seems to have few other fans.</p>
    <p>Some con­tent cre­ators and view­ers have cited it as ev­i­dence that net­works and distrib­u­tors are suc­cumb­ing to can­cel cul­ture. Even those of­fended by the con­tent at is­sue point out that re­mov­ing it can let com­pa­nies off the hook for hav­ing cre­ated it in the first place.</p>
    <p>As screen­writer Bianca Sams told In­sider re­cently: “Pre­tend­ing these episodes never ex­isted doesn’t change the fact that they did.”</p>
    <p>Rarely dis­cussed is what “pulling” some­thing ac­tu­ally en­tails in the dig­i­tal pro­duc­tion age, when film or tape hard copies rarely ex­ist, as well as what the risks are of los­ing some con­tent for­ever.</p>
    <p>Then there is the eth­i­cal di­men­sion: While it is nat­u­ral for cre­ators and cor­po­ra­tions to want to dis­tance them­selves from of­fen­sive episodes, is the best ap­proach re­ally to erase his­tory, rather than put it in con­text?</p>
    <p>“It’s a busi­ness de­ci­sion – ‘Sweep it all up. Any­thing with this goes’,” co­me­dian and ac­tor David Cross said in an interview. “Then they can say to ev­ery­body, ‘Look, we’re good, there’s none of it. Nowhere. You’re not go­ing to find it.’”</p>
    <p>Cross’ Net­flix com­edy se­ries W/ Bob and David, from 2015, had an episode taken down in June over a black­face sketch.</p>
    <p>Net­flix, Hulu, Brit­Box, Adult Swim and Com­edy Cen­tral de­clined to com­ment for this ar­ti­cle, as did cre­ators of af­fected se­ries, such as Tina Fey, Trey Parker and Noel Field­ing. Ama­zon Stu­dios, BBC Stu­dios and NBCUnivers­al did not re­spond to re­quests for com­ment.</p>
    <p>While this sum­mer has seen a flurry of re­movals, with­draw­ing con­tro­ver­sial episodes from dis­tri­bu­tion is noth­ing new, noted Ron Simon, se­nior cu­ra­tor at the Pa­ley Cen­ter for Me­dia.</p>
    <p>He cited episodes of The Twi­light Zone (The En­counter in 1964) and Se­in­feld (The Puerto Ri­can Day in 1998), both of which were with­held from syn­di­ca­tion over com­plaints that they were racist. The Puerto Ri­can Day re­turned to syn­di­ca­tion four years later; The En­counter, about a racial con­flict be­tween a white man and a Ja­panese man, was not re­run on tele­vi­sion un­til 2016.</p>
    <p>Dan Win­gate, a film-maker and for­mer tech­ni­cal spe­cial­ist in film and tele­vi­sion preser­va­tion at Sony Pic­tures En­ter­tain­ment, says that so-called take­down re­quests were stan­dard, if un­com­mon, prac­tice dur­ing his time at the stu­dio.</p>
    <p>The rea­sons for them var­ied, he says, but their source did not. “It al­ways comes through le­gal.”</p>
    <p>What has changed is the me­chan­ics of re­moval. In pre-dig­i­tal days, tak­ing an episode out of cir­cu­la­tion meant cut­ting it from the syn­di­cated re­run sched­ule and, be­hind the scenes, re­mov­ing the phys­i­cal tape mas­ters and “ser­vic­ing files” from their des­ig­nated in­ven­to­ries and la­belling them “out of ser­vice”.</p>
    <p>Episodes or films were then fun­nelled to cli­mate-con­trolled vaults and, in the case of com­pa­nies such as Sony, the Library of Congress’ Na­tional Au­dio­vi­sual Con­ser­va­tion Cen­ter in Vir­ginia.</p>
    <p>Nowa­days, with most shows en­tirely shot and stored dig­i­tally, pulling one of them “is just to take the dig­i­tal file down”, Simon said.</p>
    <p>An episode – or po­ten­tially an en­tire se­ries – can be or­dered down, fully re­moved from stream­ing and ac­cess-re­stricted in less than 24 hours.</p>
    <p>Fey and Robert Car­lock, cre­ators of 30 Rock, as well as Bill Lawrence of Scrubs, re­quested that episodes of their se­ries fea­tur­ing black­face be re­moved from stream­ing ser­vices.</p>
    <p>NBC, ABC and their var­i­ous part­ners com­plied. Net­flix paid the cre­ators a flat fee for their work on the se­ries, Cross said. The episode’s dis­ap­pear­ance there­fore will not im­pact any po­ten­tial residuals he might have re­ceived at a tra­di­tional broad­caster, as hap­pened to stars of The Cosby Show (1984 to 1992) when that se­ries was re­moved from syn­di­ca­tion in 2014.</p>
    <p>That net­works and stream­ers can now pull prob­lem­atic episodes with such speed con­cerns those charged with main­tain­ing tele­vi­sion’s his­tor­i­cal record.</p>
    <p>Ms Jane Klain, who has worked to re­cover and save lost footage as the Pa­ley Cen­ter’s re­search man­ager, notes that per­ma­nently dis­plac­ing shows, whether for so­cial or fi­nan­cial rea­sons, threat­ens to purge “trea­sures” f rom the his­tor­i­cal record.</p>
    <p>Be­fore syn­di­ca­tion (and later, stream­ing) proved the value i n sav­ing old tele­vi­sion, she said, “the net­works were very l ax” about pre­serv­ing footage.</p>
    <p>Pulled episodes and movies gen­er­ally are not de­stroyed, but re­main se­questered in pro­pri­etary dig­i­tal stor­age plat­forms, with in­ter­nal ac­cess in­def­i­nitely lim­ited to trained as­set man­agers.</p>
    <p>Win­gate warns that each i nstance of re­mov­ing an episode of a dig­i­tally pro­duced show in­creases the pos­si­bil­ity of ac­ci­den­tally los­ing or de­stroy­ing the con­tent, whereas se­ries or movies shot on film can sur­vive for 100 years when pre­served cor­rectly.</p>
    <p>He also cau­tions that as the dig­i­tal uni­verse con­tin­ues to ex­pand, many new em­ploy­ees may not be prop­erly trained to mi­grate me­dia across ever-evolv­ing for­mats.</p>
    <p>His­tor­i­cally and po­ten­tially fi­nan­cially valu­able as­sets stand to suf­fer, he says. “With new dis­tri­bu­tion com­pa­nies pop­ping up that don’t have these as­set pro­tec­tion struc­tures in place and meta­data re­quire­ments for their in­ven­to­ries, a lot more dig­i­tal as­sets could be lost.”</p>
