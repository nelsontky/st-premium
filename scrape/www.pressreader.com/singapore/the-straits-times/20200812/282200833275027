    <p>LEX­ING­TON (Ken­tucky) • Bri­tain’s Jo­hanna Konta suf­fered a health scare as she crashed out of the open­ing round of the inau­gu­ral WTA Top Seed Open on Mon­day with a straight-sets de­feat by the Czech Re­pub­lic’s Marie Bouzkova.</p>
    <p>The third seed re­quested med­i­cal at­ten­tion just a few min­utes into her 6-4, 6-4 first-round loss to the un­seeded Bouzkova.</p>
    <p>The 29-year-old looked un­com­fort­able and kept hold­ing two fin­gers to her neck to check her pulse be­fore even­tu­ally re­sum­ing play.</p>
    <p>Konta later ex­plained that she was prone to sud­den pal­pi­ta­tions that can send her heart rate soar­ing. “My heart rate shoots up for no rea­son, we didn’t have a long point, I wasn’t gassing in any way in my lungs,” she said. “It makes me a bit light­headed, I just had to see the doc­tor and the physio.</p>
    <p>“I was hav­ing all the checks. I am as fit as a fid­dle but it can hap­pen. It took a while to set­tle down un­til about 4-3 in the first set, but then it did set­tle down and I was able to con­cen­trate on the ten­nis.”</p>
    <p>Konta also re­vealed it was the fourth time she had been af­fected by the prob­lem dur­ing tour­na­ment play or prac­tice.</p>
    <p>“We don’t know why it hap­pens, it’s in stress­ful sit­u­a­tions, in non­stress­ful sit­u­a­tions,” she said. “It’s been spo­radic and we haven’t been able to cap­ture it.</p>
    <p>“I get very light­headed and I can’t func­tion for the first few sec­onds. I am wor­ried. It’s not ideal. I am go­ing to have an­other EKG (elec­tro­car­dio­g­ra­phy) test, and hope­fully, mea­sure it.</p>
    <p>“But prob­a­bly now it won’t hap­pen again for an­other year or some­thing.”</p>
    <p>The world No. 15 was the high­est pro­file ca­su­alty on Mon­day in what is the first WTA tour­na­ment to be held in the United States fol­low­ing a five-month hia­tus caused by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>For­mer world No. 1 and 23-time Ma­jor cham­pion Ser­ena Wil­liams is the big­gest name in the field, along­side her sis­ter Venus and 16-yearold sen­sa­tion Coco Gauff.</p>
    <p>Al­though Konta is still press­ing ahead with plans to play at the US Open, which is sched­uled to start on Aug 31, the hard-court Grand Slam was hit by more big-name with­drawals on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Svet­lana Kuznetsova, who won at Flush­ing Mead­ows in 2004, pulled out, say­ing on In­sta­gram: “Due to the un­favourable sit­u­a­tion due to coro­n­avirus... I made the dif­fi­cult de­ci­sion for my­self to refuse to par­tic­i­pate.”</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers also con­firmed Czech world No. 31 Barbora Strycova and China’s Wang Xiyu would not be at­tend­ing, join­ing the likes of Rafael Nadal, Ash­leigh Barty, Nick Kyr­gios, Stan Wawrinka, Kiki Bertens and Elina Svi­tolina.</p>
