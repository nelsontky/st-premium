    <p>The 11-na­tion CPTPP, com­pris­ing Aus­tralia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Ja­pan, Malaysia, Mex­ico, New Zealand, Peru, Sin­ga­pore and Viet­nam, cov­ers 500 mil­lion peo­ple and 13 per cent of the global econ­omy... The deal is now in ef­fect, hav­ing been rat­i­fied by seven sig­na­to­ries.</p>
    <p>South Korean Pres­i­dent Moon Jaein yes­ter­day mooted the idea of his coun­try en­ter­ing the re­vised Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship trade deal, join­ing China in ex­press­ing in­ter­est in a pact that Ja­pan is cred­ited for lead­ing to fruition.</p>
    <p>He dis­cussed the idea at a tradere­lated event, stress­ing the im­por­tance of di­ver­si­fy­ing the coun­try’s ex­port mar­ket to drive growth in the pan­demic-hit econ­omy.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s Yon­hap News Agency said this was the first time Mr Moon had pub­licly dis­cussed the idea, though Ja­pan’s Nikkei news­pa­per noted that Mr Moon’s pre­de­ces­sor Park Geun-hye had shown in­ter­est in the deal as early as in 2013.</p>
    <p>“Di­ver­si­fy­ing the mar­ket is a task that (we) should achieve,” Mr Moon said, adding that his gov­ern­ment will “con­tinue to re­view join­ing” the pact known for­mally as the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship (CPTPP).</p>
    <p>He stressed that the “strong­est weapon” against pro­tec­tion­ism was global com­pet­i­tive­ness in pro­duc­ing good prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>The 11-na­tion CPTPP, com­pris­ing Aus­tralia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Ja­pan, Malaysia, Mex­ico, New Zealand, Peru, Sin­ga­pore and Viet­nam, cov­ers 500 mil­lion peo­ple and 13 per cent of the global econ­omy.</p>
    <p>For­mer Ja­panese prime min­is­ter Shinzo Abe has been cred­ited for lead­ing the deal to com­ple­tion after the pull-out by US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump. The deal is now in ef­fect, hav­ing been rat­i­fied by seven sig­na­to­ries.</p>
    <p>It has far more strin­gent terms in ar­eas such as mar­ket ac­cess and in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty than the 15-mem­ber Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship deal inked last month, com­pris­ing the 10 Asean states as well as Aus­tralia, China, Ja­pan, New Zealand and South Korea. The bloc cov­ers 30 per cent of the global econ­omy.</p>
    <p>This is why there has been healthy scep­ti­cism over the vi­a­bil­ity of China join­ing the CPTPP.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping said at the Asia-Pa­cific Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion sum­mit last month that the group “must con­tinue to pro­mote re­gional eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion and es­tab­lish an Asia-Pa­cific free trade zone at an early date”. He said China “will ac­tively con­sider join­ing” the CPTPP.</p>
    <p>But Ja­panese For­eign Min­is­ter Toshim­itsu Motegi said that while Tokyo wel­comes the in­ter­est, this needs fur­ther as­sess­ment ac­cord­ing to the pact’s rules.</p>
    <p>Keio Univer­sity economist Fuku­nari Kimura thinks the bar­ri­ers are high for China to join the CPTPP, and many ex­cep­tions might have to be made to al­low its par­tic­i­pa­tion. He told a we­bi­nar on free trade for for­eign jour­nal­ists in Tokyo: “Gen­er­ally speak­ing, for</p>
    <p>China to com­ply with the re­quire­ments un­der the CPTTP, it will have to un­der­take do­mes­tic re­forms that are ex­tremely dif­fi­cult.”</p>
    <p>These ar­eas in­clude mar­ket ac­cess through the elim­i­na­tion of tar­iffs and the lib­er­al­i­sa­tion of ser­vice in­vest­ments, as well as rules gov­ern­ing e-com­merce and sta­te­owned en­ter­prises, he added.</p>
    <p>He also doubted there will be an im­me­di­ate re­turn to the trade deal by the US un­der Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den, given that any such plan will be po­lit­i­cally dif­fi­cult.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, other economies, in­clud­ing Tai­wan and Bri­tain, had pre­vi­ously ex­pressed in­ter­est in join­ing the CPTPP.</p>
    <p>Dr Kimura said CPTPP mem­ber states will see ben­e­fits in South Korea – the world’s ninth-largest econ­omy, ac­cord­ing to fore­casts this year – join­ing the part­ner­ship, given that “its in­clu­sion will fur­ther re­in­force the coali­tion of mid­dle pow­ers”.</p>
