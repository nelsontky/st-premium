    <p>A do­mes­tic worker who wanted to get her pass­port back from her em­ployer geared up for the con­fronta­tion by sharp­en­ing one knife and hid­ing a sec­ond, smaller knife in a bas­ket un­der the sink of a toi­let on the sec­ond floor of the house, the pros­e­cu­tion said.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian maid Dary­ati ul­ti­mately took along an­other weapon – a long knife from the store­room – when she con­fronted Madam Seow Kim Choo, 59, at her Telok Ku­rau house on June 7, 2016.</p>
    <p>When Madam Seow put up re­sis­tance, she was slit and stabbed in the neck. As she lay bleed­ing on the toi­let floor, Dary­ati re­trieved the knife she had ear­lier hid­den, and con­tin­ued stab­bing her em­ployer, the court heard.</p>
    <p>The de­tails of Dary­ati’s prepa­ra­tion and her “cruel” at­tack on Madam Seow were re­counted by Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Wong Kok Weng in the on­go­ing mur­der trial yes­ter­day, as he con­tended she had in­tended to kill her em­ployer.</p>
    <p>Dary­ati, whose doc­u­mented age is 28 but who claims she is two years younger, in­flicted over 90 stab wounds on Madam Seow, us­ing so much force that at least three of the blows caused frac­tures to her face.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause of your self­ish in­ten­tion to take your pass­port and take money from (your em­ployer), you stabbed her so vi­ciously on her face and neck so many times that she bled to death,” said the DPP.</p>
    <p>Dary­ati replied: “Ini­tially I wanted to get my pass­port back but I could not con­trol my anger. I could not con­trol my hands which stabbed Madam.”</p>
    <p>The DPP con­tended Dary­ati had con­trol over her ac­tions and was not suf­fer­ing from any men­tal con­di­tion that sub­stan­tially im­paired her re­spon­si­bil­ity for her ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Dary­ati dis­agreed, say­ing through an in­ter­preter: “I was in a very an­gry state. I was very emo­tional and I could not con­trol my hands.”</p>
    <p>The DPP also took Dary­ati through her po­lice state­ments to show that she was pre­pared to kill Madam Seow.</p>
    <p>She had said in one state­ment: “If she re­fused to give me my pass­port, I would have killed her.”</p>
    <p>Dary­ati ini­tially faced the manda­tory death penalty for mur­der.</p>
    <p>In April, af­ter 17 days of trial, she ad­mit­ted to a lesser mur­der charge, which car­ries life im­pris­on­ment or the death sen­tence, but prose­cu­tors said they were not press­ing for cap­i­tal pun­ish­ment.</p>
    <p>In a twist last month, she with­drew her guilty plea in the hope of get­ting a lower sen­tence by call­ing de­fence psy­chi­a­trist Tommy Tan to tes­tify that she was suf­fer­ing from a men­tal con­di­tion that di­min­ished her re­spon­si­bil­ity for her ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan and the pros­e­cu­tion psy­chi­a­trist, Dr Jay­dip Sarkar, are ex­pected to tes­tify when the trial con­tin­ues next year.</p>
