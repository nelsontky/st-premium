    <p>Pro­fes­sor Sung will be con­cur­rently ap­pointed as NTU’s se­nior vice-pres­i­dent (health and life sci­ences), as­sum­ing re­spon­si­bil­ity for the in­te­gra­tion of univer­sity-wide ac­tiv­i­ties in health, medicine and life sci­ences.</p>
    <p>He will also be ap­pointed to the tenured fac­ulty rank of Dis­tin­guished Univer­sity Pro­fes­sor, which is the high­est NTU fac­ulty rank given to mem­bers with ex­tra­or­di­nary schol­arly achieve­ments that typ­i­cally span mul­ti­ple dis­ci­plinary bound­aries.</p>
    <p>The for­mal start of his ten­ure at NTU will be April 1 next year.</p>

    <p>Prof Sung has achieved high recog­ni­tion for his re­search in gas­troen­terol­ogy, teach­ing and lead­er­ship. He has also re­ceived grants for his re­search work cov­er­ing a va­ri­ety of health­care con­cerns – from gas­tric dis­or­ders and can­cers to the se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome</p>
    <p>WELL PO­SI­TIONED FOR NEXT CHAP­TER</p>
    <p>NTU is well po­si­tioned to fo­cus our in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary strengths on tack­ling grand chal­lenges in health­care, and we are de­lighted that an in­di­vid­ual of Prof Sung’s cal­i­bre will lead this next chap­ter of de­vel­op­ment at Lee Kong Chian</p>

    <p>NTU said that Prof Sung was “unan­i­mously rec­om­mended af­ter a global search” by the LKCMedicin­e dean search ad­vi­sory com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>NTU pres­i­dent Subra Suresh said he is look­ing for­ward to work­ing with Prof Sung, adding: “NTU is well po­si­tioned to fo­cus our in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary strengths on tack­ling grand chal­lenges in health­care, and we are de­lighted that an in­di­vid­ual of Prof Sung’s cal­i­bre will lead this next chap­ter of de­vel­op­ment at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine.”</p>
    <p>On his im­pend­ing move to Sin­ga­pore, Prof Sung said: “I am hon­oured to be given the op­por­tu­nity to lead LKCMedicin­e and to join the cur­rent se­nior lead­er­ship team to con­trib­ute to the univer­sity-wide de­vel­op­ment of ac­tiv­i­ties that will im­prove health­care in Sin­ga­pore, the re­gion and across the globe.”</p>
    <p>Prof Sung com­pleted his MBBS de­gree at the Univer­sity of Hong Kong in 1983. He ob­tained his PhD from the Univer­sity of Cal­gary in 1992 and Doc­tor of Medicine de­gree from CUHK in 1997.</p>
