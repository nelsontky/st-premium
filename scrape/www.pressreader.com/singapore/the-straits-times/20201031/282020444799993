    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s big­gest achieve­ment in East Asia would be his his­toric sum­mit with Mr Kim Jong Un in Sin­ga­pore in 2018, which marked the first time a sit­ting Amer­i­can leader met his North Korean coun­ter­part to re­solve the nu­clear is­sue.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump should get “due credit” for the meet­ing, said Dr Lee Seong-hyon of the Se­jong In­sti­tute think-tank. But be­yond that, he “re­ally demon­strated an in­abil­ity to com­pre­hend the im­por­tance of al­lies for the US”, Dr Lee told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Most ex­perts agree Mr Trump mis­man­aged strate­gic al­liances with Ja­pan and South Korea, ex­tracted empty promises from North Korea and failed to curb China.</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic can­di­date Joe Bi­den, who is lead­ing in opin­ion polls ahead of the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, will have to undo the mis­steps of Mr Trump, they added.</p>
    <p>Ewha Wo­mans Univer­sity’s as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of in­ter­na­tional stud­ies Leif-Eric Easley said Mr Trump’s “mis­man­age­ment of al­liances, trade and Covid-19 re­duced con­fi­dence in the US across Asia”. “There is thus much for the next ad­min­is­tra­tion to cor­rect.”</p>
    <p>US al­liances with Ja­pan and South Korea, orig­i­nally meant to ex­tend US in­flu­ence in the re­gion and form the back­bone of global se­cu­rity, be­came a mere dol­lar game when Mr Trump de­manded five­fold in­creases in de­fence cost­shar­ing from both al­lies and pres­sured them to re­duce their trade sur­plus with the US.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion also did lit­tle to me­di­ate when a forced labour is­sue be­tween South Korea and Ja­pan es­ca­lated into a trade</p>
    <p>war. US has also failed to get any con­crete com­mit­ment on de­nu­cle­ari­sa­tion from North Korea.</p>
    <p>Dr Tosh Minohara, who chairs the Re­search In­sti­tute for In­doPa­cific Af­fairs think-tank, said: “Bi­den is a more tra­di­tional US leader who val­ues al­liances and who will take a more win-win ap­proach rather than a more trans­ac­tional zero-sum ap­proach.”</p>
    <p>But this does not mean a re­peat of for­mer pres­i­dent Barack Obama’s rel­a­tively soft ap­proach to­wards China or strate­gic pa­tience to­wards North Korea.</p>
    <p>“China now ap­pears promi­nently in the US’ rear-view mir­ror, and the US can no longer play Mr Nice Guy,” said Dr Minohara.</p>
    <p>For­mer US diplo­mat Glen Fukushima said a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will have “greater de­sire to work bi­lat­er­ally with Ja­pan, and mul­ti­lat­er­ally on is­sues like cli­mate change, pan­demics, North Korea and China”.</p>
    <p>But if Mr Trump is re-elected, he is likely to “con­tinue with the Amer­ica First ap­proach”.</p>
    <p>Bi­den is a more tra­di­tional US leader who val­ues al­liances and who will take a more win-win ap­proach rather than a more trans­ac­tional zero-sum ap­proach.</p>
