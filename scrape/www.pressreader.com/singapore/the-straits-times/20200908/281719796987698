    <p>There is a limit to what the Gov­ern­ment can do to cush­ion the weak­en­ing job mar­ket, said ob­servers, who ex­pect tens of thou­sands of jobs here to be cut within the next half a year, when the full im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic will be felt.</p>
    <p>Mea­sures that have staved off re­trench­ments, such as the re­cently ex­tended Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS) that helps off­set part of the wages of lo­cal work­ers, draw heav­ily on the coun­try’s re­serves, added ex­perts, who fear the in­ten­sity of lay­offs will build up for a while.</p>
    <p>Avi­a­tion, tourism, re­tail, hospi­tal­ity, en­ter­tain­ment, food and bev­er­age, ma­rine and off­shore, and con­struc­tion will be hit hard.</p>
    <p>Their views echoed those of Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat, who in a min­is­te­rial state­ment on Aug 17 said that re­trench­ments will be in­evitable de­spite the Gov­ern­ment’s best ef­forts. He added that the JSS can­not be sus­tained at cur­rent lev­els.</p>
    <p>Labour ex­perts said work­ers have so far been shel­tered from the worst eco­nomic ef­fects due to sub­stan­tial gov­ern­ment sup­port.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore se­nior eco­nomics lec­turer Kelvin Seah said: “No­body knows how long (the pan­demic) will last. There is too much un­cer­tainty. It will de­pend on whether coun­tries are able to con­tain the virus ef­fec­tively.”</p>
    <p>The out­look re­mains un­cer­tain and not just within Sin­ga­pore, said the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM). It added that the im­pact of the pan­demic and the mit­i­ga­tion mea­sures were not fully felt in the first quar­ter of the year.</p>
    <p>“We are now start­ing to see the deeper im­pact of Covid-19 on the labour mar­ket,” MOM said.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) deputy sec­re­tary-gen­eral Cham Hui Fong said: “Within the unionised sec­tor, we are wit­ness­ing an in­crease in the num­ber of re­trenched work­ers, es­pe­cially dur­ing these few months, as com­pared to last year.”</p>
    <p>The pan­demic will be long drawn and busi­ness vol­umes for many sec­tors will be un­able to re­cover for a while, she said. Some firms would have no choice but to re­sort to lay­offs af­ter ex­haust­ing other cost­cut­ting mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Re­trench­ments more than dou­bled in the sec­ond quar­ter of this year, with 6,700 work­ers laid off, up from 3,220 in the first quar­ter. This was higher than the peak of 5,510 dur­ing the 2003 Sars out­break, but be­low the 2009 global fi­nan­cial cri­sis high of 12,760.</p>
    <p>And this is only the tip of a large ice­berg, warned ob­servers.</p>
    <p>Last month, labour chief Ng Chee Meng said he ex­pects job losses to rise in the next six to 12 months as the eco­nomic im­pact of the pan­demic be­comes widely felt.</p>
    <p>Dr Seah noted that lay­offs typ­i­cally do not hap­pen right af­ter busi­nesses see a fall in their profits.</p>
    <p>“Al­though busi­nesses might be los­ing money, they may still try to re­tain work­ers,” he added. “If profits con­tinue to fall for a sus­tained pe­riod, then com­pa­nies have lit­tle choice but to lay off work­ers. Some of these busi­nesses may not even sur­vive them­selves.”</p>
    <p>When firms in key sec­tors like avi­a­tion and tourism fare poorly, “there will be a domino ef­fect since these peo­ple suf­fer a fall in in­come”, Dr Seah pointed out.</p>
    <p>The avi­a­tion and aero­space sec­tors have been badly hit by Covid-19, with air travel crip­pled by bor­der clo­sures and air­lines ground­ing planes. Aero­space gi­ant Pratt & Whit­ney, air­craft man­u­fac­turer Air­bus and en­gine maker Rolls-Royce are among ma­jor firms that have cut staff here due to de­clin­ing busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The im­pact has trick­led down to other busi­nesses, in­clud­ing Re­sorts World Sen­tosa and Mil­len­nium Ho­tels and Re­sorts, which have also re­trenched work­ers here.</p>
    <p>Mr David Leong, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of hu­man re­sources firm Peo­pleWorld­wide Con­sult­ing, said most af­fected sec­tors are run­ning at sub­op­ti­mal ca­pac­i­ties and con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>“The in­dus­tries that de­pend on foot­fall, face-to-face hu­man traf­fic are the ones that are crit­i­cally crip­pled,” he added. “This may take half a year to go by be­fore we can see any mod­est signs of re­cov­ery.”</p>
    <p>Mr Paul Heng, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of NeXT Career Con­sult­ing Group, pointed out that there will al­ways be job cuts – in­clud­ing from busi­ness units mov­ing out of the coun­try and merg­ers and ac­qui­si­tions. The pan­demic has just ne­ces­si­tated more.</p>
    <p>But re­trench­ments will al­ways be a last re­sort, said Ms Cham, adding that em­bat­tled busi­nesses would first im­ple­ment cost-cut­ting al­ter­na­tives such as a shorter work week, no-pay leave and wage cuts.</p>
    <p>Unions and as­so­ci­a­tions said they have been busy work­ing with firms in re­cent months in an ef­fort to save as many jobs as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the fin­tech in­dus­try is not spared from the eco­nomic fall­out of Covid-19, said Sin­ga­pore Fin­Tech As­so­ci­a­tion pres­i­dent Chia Hock Lai. A re­cent sur­vey by the as­so­ci­a­tion found that over a quar­ter of its mem­bers had re­duced man­power, al­though many in­di­cated that the down­siz­ing was tem­po­rary.</p>
    <p>Mr Gil­bert Tan, chief ex­ec­u­tive of NTUC’s Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute, which of­fers train­ing and job match­ing for Sin­ga­pore­ans who have lost their jobs, said it will con­tinue to hold job fairs to of­fer op­por­tu­ni­ties to those af­fected.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Hu­man Re­sources In­sti­tute pres­i­dent Low Peck Kem ad­vised work­ers to quickly bounce back if they can, in­clud­ing tak­ing on gig work or reach­ing out to dif­fer­ent in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>“The longer you stay un­em­ployed, the more dif­fi­cult it is to go back to the work­force,” she added.</p>
    <p>UN­CER­TAIN TIMES</p>
    <p>No­body knows how long (the pan­demic) will last. There is too much un­cer­tainty. It will de­pend on whether coun­tries are able to con­tain the virus ef­fec­tively.</p>
