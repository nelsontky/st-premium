    <p>SYD­NEY • The lyrics of Aus­tralia’s na­tional an­them have been al­tered by one word to recog­nise the coun­try’s in­dige­nous his­tory, Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son an­nounced on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Un­til yes­ter­day, the song be­gan: “Aus­tralians all let us re­joice, for we are young and free.” But as the coun­try cel­e­brated the be­gin­ning of the new year, the word “young” was dropped. The an­them now de­scribes the coun­try as “one and free”.</p>
    <p>“We live in a time­less land of an­cient First Na­tions peo­ples, and we draw to­gether the sto­ries of more than 300 na­tional an­ces­tries and lan­guage groups,” Mr Mor­ri­son told re­porters in Can­berra.</p>
    <p>“And our an­them should re­flect that. The changes we have made and we have an­nounced to­day, I think, achieve that goal.”</p>
    <p>The an­them Ad­vance Aus­tralia Fair was writ­ten by com­poser Peter Dodds McCormick in 1878. It be­came the na­tional an­them in 1984, re­plac­ing God Save The Queen, and the first line was changed to make it more in­clu­sive of women – “Aus­tralia’s sons” be­came “Aus­tralians all”.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics of the “young and free” lyric said it sug­gested that Aus­tralia’s his­tory be­gan rel­a­tively re­cently, per­haps with the fed­er­a­tion of Aus­tralia on Jan 1, 1901, or the rais­ing of a Bri­tish flag at Syd­ney Cove on Jan 26, 1788. That event is of­fi­cially com­mem­o­rated as a hol­i­day, Aus­tralia Day, but some in­dige­nous ac­tivists re­fer to it as “In­va­sion Day”.</p>
    <p>The idea to change the lyrics was floated last year by New South Wales Premier Gla­dys Bere­jik­lian who said the word­ing ig­nored Aus­tralia’s “proud First Na­tions cul­ture”.</p>
    <p>The pro­posal was wel­comed by sev­eral law­mak­ers, in­clud­ing Min­is­ter for In­dige­nous Aus­tralians Ken Wy­att as well as fire­brand right-wing One Na­tion party leader Pauline Han­son.</p>
