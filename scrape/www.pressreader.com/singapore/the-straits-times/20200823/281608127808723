    <p>Sin­ga­porean cousins Nel­son Loh and Ter­ence Loh have been in­volved in more than 30 com­pa­nies be­tween them, as share­hold­ers or direc­tors.</p>
    <p>One of the new­est, the Bel­la­graph Nova Group (BN Group), is now in the news for its re­ported bid for New­cas­tle United Foot­ball Club.</p>
    <p>On its web­site, BN Group is de­scribed as an “es­tab­lished con­sor­tium with di­verse in­vest­ment hold­ings across mul­ti­ple in­dus­tries such as health­care, fi­nan­cial hold­ings, con­sumer tech­nol­ogy and lux­ury life­style”.</p>
    <p>It says it has “31 en­ti­ties” and a “com­bined US$12 billion rev­enue” and is “head­quar­tered in the glitzy no. 1 0 Place Ven­dome, Paris, France”. The sum is equiv­a­lent to S$16.5 billion.</p>
    <p>Its reg­is­tered ad­dress, though, is in the de­cid­edly more hum­ble Novena Gar­dens i n Sin­ga­pore’s Thom­son Road. The four-storey con­dominum houses shops, apart­ments and of­fices.</p>
    <p>The group – in­cor­po­rated as Bel­la­graph Nova Pte Ltd in Sin­ga­pore – oc­cu­pies a non­de­script fourth­storey unit with opaque glass doors and a dark blue fa­cade.</p>
    <p>When The Sunday Times vis­ited yes­ter­day, the of­fice was closed. A wooden crate and card­board car­ton sit­ting out­side its doors had la­bels list­ing among its con­tents a “ti­ta­nium rice in­tel­li­gent dis­in­fec­tion ro­bot TMiRob”.</p>
    <p>The com­pany is listed in the Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Author­ity data­base as a hold­ing com­pany.</p>
    <p>On its own web­site, it is de­scribed as “the only group in the world to boast an in­ter­na­tional pres­ence in all ma­jor com­mer­cial sec­tors” rang­ing from health­care to fi­nan­cial ser­vices, tech­nol­ogy and me­dia.</p>
    <p>Lit­tle else is known of the BN Group con­sor­tium that claims to em­ploy 23,000 peo­ple world­wide.</p>
    <p>Set up on July 20, it was born of a merger be­tween the DORR Group – another com­pany founded by the Loh cousins – and the Bel­la­graph Group, a com­pany founded by Chi­nese na­tional Evan­ge­line Shen, 32.</p>
    <p>Mr Nel­son Loh, 40, Mr Ter­ence Loh, 42, and Ms Shen are the only share­hold­ers of Bel­la­graph Nova Pte Ltd, which was set up with a paid up cap­i­tal of S$20 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The Loh cousins, who have of­ten said in in­ter­views that they are as close as brothers, are former bankers with JPMor­gan.</p>
    <p>It has been re­ported that Mr Ter­ence Loh had stud­ied in the United States, while Mr Nel­son Loh had at­tended Cam­bridge Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with The Peak magazine in 2018, they said they had set up DORR Group in 2008 after let­ting a game of roulette at a Las Ve­gas casino de­cide if they should stay with their jobs or strike out on their own.</p>
    <p>The cousins, said to have grown up in the same fam­ily home in Bukit Timah, had re­vealed at the in­ter­view that the name DORR comes from the ini­tials of two char­ac­ters in their favourite movie, Ocean’s 11, about an elab­o­rate heist.</p>
    <p>It was through this in­vest­ment ve­hi­cle, re­port­edly man­ag­ing over US$4 billion in funds and as­sets as of De­cem­ber last year, that the cousins ex­panded into the health­care and aes­thet­ics busi­ness, set­ting up the Novena Global Life­care Group.</p>
    <p>And it was at an ed­u­ca­tion ben­e­fit fund-rais­ing din­ner or­gan­ised by Novena Global that the cousins were pho­tographed with former Amer­i­can pres­i­dent Barack Obama, whose doc­tored pictures are said to have been used in mar­ket­ing ma­te­rial and so­cial me­dia chan­nels of the Bel­la­graph Nova Group.</p>
    <p>Mr Obama was in­vited to speak at the event held on Dec 14 last year at the Ritz Carl­ton. Guests in­cluded ty­coons, phi­lan­thropists and Malaysian roy­alty.</p>
    <p>The cousins have been in­volved in other in­vest­ment and hold­ing com­pa­nies as well as con­sul­tan­cies and real es­tate com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>One of the com­pa­nies, the DORR Global Health­care In­ter­na­tional Pte Ltd, reg­is­tered in 2016, has a paid up cap­i­tal of $50 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Be­sides Bel­la­graph Nova Group, the cousins are linked to Ms Shen, also known as Shen Che, through the com­pany Rock Star Ad­vi­sors Pte Ltd and Kona In­vest­ment Pte Ltd.</p>
    <p>Ms Shen, who said she is a grad­u­ate of Fu­dan Univer­sity in Shang­hai, was a lawyer from Jin­mao LLP in China, which has of­fices in Bei­jing and Shang­hai, and then an in­vest­ment banker. Now the chair­man of BN Group, she is de­scribed on the web­site as hav­ing led mul­ti­ple ven­tures across in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>One of them, Bel­la­graph Jew­elry, is de­scribed as “an ul­tra-high lux­ury Parisian-de­signed jew­elry house renowned for its be­spoke in­vest­ment-grade jew­elry”.</p>
    <p>A July 5 press re­lease on the BN Group site claims Bel­la­graph Jew­elry pi­o­neered the “unique strat­egy” of selling high-end jew­elry pieces on­line.</p>
    <p>It said it had sold a piece of red di­a­mond jew­ellery for “a stag­ger­ing price of US$102 mil­lion”, and also gar­nered “over 20 mil­lion weekly views on­line across var­i­ous so­cial me­dia plat­forms... which is on par with on­line views for Ap­ple”.</p>
    <p>The com­pany, de­scribed on its web­site as an “es­tab­lished con­sor­tium” with “31 en­ti­ties” and a “com­bined US$12 billion rev­enue” is said to be “head­quar­tered in the glitzy no. 10 Place Ven­dome, Paris, France”. Its reg­is­tered ad­dress, though, is in the de­cid­edly more hum­ble Novena Gar­dens in Sin­ga­pore’s Thom­son Road.</p>
