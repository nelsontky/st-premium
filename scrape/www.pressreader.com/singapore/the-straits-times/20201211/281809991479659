    <p>•</p>
    <p>LON­DON Bri­tain’s medicine reg­u­la­tor has said that any­one with a his­tory of ana­phy­laxis or se­vere re­ac­tion to a medicine or food should not get the Pfizer-BioN­Tech Covid-19 vac­cine, giv­ing fuller guid­ance on an ear­lier al­lergy warn­ing about the shot.</p>
    <p>Start­ing with the el­derly and front-line work­ers, Bri­tain be­gan mass vac­ci­nat­ing its pop­u­la­tion on Tues­day, part of a global drive that poses one of the big­gest lo­gis­ti­cal chal­lenges in peace­time his­tory.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s Medicines and Health­care Products Reg­u­la­tory Agency on Wed­nes­day said that there had been two re­ports of ana­phy­laxis and one of a pos­si­ble al­ler­gic re­ac­tion since the vac­cine roll­out be­gan.</p>
    <p>“Any per­son with a his­tory of ana­phy­laxis to a vac­cine, medicine or food should not re­ceive the Pfizer BioN­Tech vac­cine,” the agency’s chief ex­ec­u­tive June Raine said.</p>
    <p>“Most peo­ple will not get ana­phy­laxis and the ben­e­fits in pro­tect­ing peo­ple against Covid-19 out­weigh the risks... You can be com­pletely con­fi­dent that this vac­cine has met the (agency’s) ro­bust stan­dards of safety, qual­ity and ef­fec­tive­ness.”</p>
    <p>Ana­phy­laxis is an over­re­ac­tion</p>
    <p>Ana­phy­laxis is an over­re­ac­tion of the body’s im­mune sys­tem, which the Na­tional Health Ser­vice in Bri­tain de­scribes as se­vere and some­times life-threat­en­ing.</p>
    <p>of the body’s i mmune sys­tem, which the Na­tional Health Ser­vice in Bri­tain de­scribes as se­vere and some­times life-threat­en­ing.</p>
    <p>The fuller guid­ance clar­i­fies that the main risk is from ana­phy­laxis specif­i­cally. The agency had ini­tially ad­vised any­one with a his­tory of a “sig­nif­i­cant al­ler­gic re­ac­tion” not to take the shot.</p>
    <p>Pfizer and BioN­Tech said they are sup­port­ing the agency’s in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>Last week, the Bri­tish agency be­came the first in the world to ap­prove the vac­cine, de­vel­oped by Pfizer and its Ger­man part­ner BioN­Tech, while the US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA) and the Euro­pean Medicines Agency con­tinue to as­sess the data.</p>
    <p>Dr Mon­cef Slaoui, a top US health of­fi­cial, said on Wed­nes­day that</p>
    <p>peo­ple with known se­vere re­ac­tions will be asked to not take the vac­cine, un­til the FDA un­der­stands ex­actly what hap­pened.</p>
    <p>It will prob­a­bly also ask providers to mon­i­tor whether peo­ple de­velop a rare but temporary and not very se­ri­ous form of fa­cial paral­y­sis called Bell’s palsy, after data showed that four peo­ple out of about 19,000 in the vac­cine arm of the trial got the con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Canada’s health min­istry has said it would look at the re­ported ad­verse re­ac­tions in Bri­tain, but added that ad­verse events were to be ex­pected and would not nec­es­sar­ily change the risk or ben­e­fit of the shot, after the coun­try ap­proved the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Dr Raine told law­mak­ers such al­ler­gic re­ac­tions had not been a fea­ture of Pfizer’s clin­i­cal tri­als. Pfizer</p>
    <p>has said peo­ple with a his­tory of se­vere ad­verse al­ler­gic re­ac­tions to vac­cines or the can­di­date’s in­gre­di­ents were ex­cluded from their late stage tri­als, which is re­flected in the Bri­tish agency’s emer­gency ap­proval pro­to­col.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the al­ler­gic re­ac­tions may have been caused by a com­po­nent of Pfizer’s vac­cine called poly­eth­yl­ene gly­col, or PEG, which helps sta­bilise the shot and is not in other types of vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Im­pe­rial Col­lege Lon­don’s ex­pert in al­lergy and im­munol­ogy Paul Turner, who has been ad­vis­ing the Bri­tish agency on its re­vised guid­ance, said: “As we’ve had more in­for­ma­tion... the ini­tial con­cern that maybe it af­fects ev­ery­one with al­ler­gies is not true.</p>
    <p>“The in­gre­di­ents like PEG which we think might be re­spon­si­ble for</p>
    <p>the re­ac­tions are not re­lated to things which can cause food al­lergy. Like­wise, peo­ple with a known al­lergy to just one medicine should not be at risk.”</p>
    <p>In the United States, doc­u­ments re­leased by the FDA in prepa­ra­tion for an ad­vi­sory com­mit­tee meet­ing said 0.63 per cent of peo­ple in the vac­cine group and 0.51 per cent in the placebo group had re­ported pos­si­ble al­ler­gic re­ac­tions in tri­als. Pro­fes­sor of ex­per­i­men­tal medicine Peter Open­shaw, from Im­pe­rial Col­lege Lon­don, said those num­bers were very small.</p>
    <p>“The fact that we know so soon about these two al­ler­gic re­ac­tions and that the reg­u­la­tor has acted on this to is­sue pre­cau­tion­ary ad­vice shows that this mon­i­tor­ing sys­tem is work­ing well,” he said.</p>
    <p>The al­ler­gic re­ac­tions may have been caused by a com­po­nent of Pfizer’s vac­cine called poly­eth­yl­ene gly­col, or PEG, which helps sta­bilise the shot and is not in other types of vac­cines.</p>
