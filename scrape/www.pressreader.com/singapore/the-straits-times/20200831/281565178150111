    <p>Global cor­po­ra­tions have an­nounced more than 200,000 job cuts or buy­outs in re­cent weeks, a wor­ry­ing sign that more losses will come as fur­loughs turn into per­ma­nent lay­offs. MGM Re­sorts In­ter­na­tional and Coca-Cola were the lat­est ex­am­ples last Friday, join­ing an in­creas­ing num­ber of com­pa­nies that are trim­ming their work­force.</p>
    <p>NEW YORK • Global cor­po­ra­tions have an­nounced more than 200,000 job cuts or buy­outs in re­cent weeks, a wor­ry­ing sign that more losses will come as fur­loughs im­ple­mented early in the pan­demic turn into per­ma­nent lay­offs.</p>
    <p>MGM Re­sorts In­ter­na­tional and Coca-Cola were the lat­est ex­am­ples last Friday, join­ing an in­creas­ing num­ber of com­pa­nies that are trim­ming their work­force af­ter economies emerged from shut­downs.</p>
    <p>Al­most a quar­ter of work­ers in the United States that were tem­porar­ily laid off prob­a­bly will not come back, ac­cord­ing to Gold­man Sachs Group es­ti­mates.</p>
    <p>The cuts cast a shadow on the frag­ile re­bound in the global econ­omy at a time when Covid-19 con­tin­ues to pose a threat and many govern­ment stim­u­lus pro­grammes have run their course.</p>
    <p>The im­pact is wide­spread. Air­lines were hit the ear­li­est by a col­lapse in travel, and the job losses have now ex­tended to re­tail­ers, en­ter­tain­ment and cos­met­ics firms.</p>
    <p>Here are some of the largest job­cut plans an­nounced i n re­cent weeks:</p>
    <p>TRAVEL AND TOURISM</p>
    <p>As of July 24, more than 400,000 air­line work­ers had been fired, fur­loughed or told they may lose their jobs in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>More have been an­nounced since, in­clud­ing Amer­i­can Air­lines cut­ting 19,000 work­ers. Lufthansa is work­ing on more cost-tight­en­ing mea­sures that could see an­other 20,000 jobs cut, a Swiss news­pa­per re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>CON­SUMER GOODS AND RE­TAIL</p>
    <p>The US re­tail in­dus­try fur­loughed more than one mil­lion work­ers in early April amid lock­downs.</p>
    <p>Many may be­come per­ma­nent. Cos­met­ics gi­ant Es­tee Lauder, which had im­ple­mented fur­loughs dur­ing the shut­downs, now plans to re­duce its work­force by 1,500 to 2,000 jobs world­wide, or about 3 per cent of to­tal staff.</p>
    <p>Ulta Beauty said it brought back 17,000 of the 33,000 em­ploy­ees fur­loughed in April. How­ever, not all the re­main­ing work­ers will be able to re­turn this year.</p>
    <p>Wal­greens Boots Al­liance said it planned to cut roughly 4,000 jobs in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Coca-Cola of­fered early de­par­tures to 4,000 work­ers in North Amer­ica, with more planned around the globe.</p>
    <p>Bed Bath & Be­yond will elim­i­nate 2,800 jobs.</p>
    <p>L Brands, which owns Vic­to­ria’s Se­cret, plans to cut 850 po­si­tions, while Levi Strauss wants to elim­i­nate 700 jobs.</p>
    <p>INDUSTRIAL­S</p>
    <p>With no sign that fly­ing will re­cover soon, mak­ers of planes and en­gines are shed­ding work­ers. Raytheon said at the end of last month that it</p>
    <p>slashed about 8,000 jobs in its com­mer­cial avi­a­tion busi­nesses, af­ter dis­clos­ing fur­loughs in May.</p>
    <p>Boe­ing is pre­par­ing to of­fer buy­outs to em­ploy­ees for a sec­ond time this year, ex­tend­ing work­force cuts be­yond the orig­i­nal 10 per cent tar­get un­veiled in April.</p>
    <p>Air­bus chief ex­ec­u­tive Guil­laume Faury said last month a plan for 15,000 job cuts was not the worstcase sce­nario and it would need to adapt again if a sec­ond wave emerges.</p>
    <p>EN­TER­TAIN­MENT</p>
    <p>MGM, the largest op­er­a­tor of casi­nos on the Las Ve­gas Strip, said it is send­ing pink slips to about 18,000 em­ploy­ees, more than one-quar­ter of its pre-pan­demic US work­force.</p>
    <p>NBCUniver­sal is cut­ting jobs across its broad­cast and ca­ble tele­vi­sion busi­nesses, movie stu­dios and theme parks. The cuts may amount to 10 per cent of its 35,000-per­son pay­roll.</p>
    <p>TECH­NOL­OGY</p>
    <p>Sales­force.com plans to cut 1,000 jobs, sources said, while Mi­crosoft cut fewer than 1,000 jobs.</p>
    <p>FI­NANCE</p>
    <p>With the prospect of bil­lions in soured loans, some large Euro­pean banks have said they need to cut work­ers. US banks, how­ever, have largely ab­stained, ex­cept for Wells Fargo. Wire­card said it will elim­i­nate more than half of its staff, or about 730 jobs, and make other “far-reach­ing cuts”.</p>
    <p>Deutsche Bank’s re­tail unit is ac­cel­er­at­ing thou­sands of job cuts at its Ger­man head of­fices, while Stan­dard Char­tered was set to be­gin a new round of job cuts at the end of last month, restart­ing re­duc­tions put on hold at the virus’ out­set.</p>
