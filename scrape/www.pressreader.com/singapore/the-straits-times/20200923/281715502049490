    <p>There were 21 new con­firmed coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,627.</p>
    <p>They in­cluded one im­ported case – a work per­mit holder who re­turned from In­dia on Sept 10.</p>
    <p>She was placed on a 14-day stay­home no­tice on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>There were no com­mu­nity cases for the sec­ond day in a row, and also no new lo­ca­tions and clus­ters.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries ac­counted for the re­main­ing 20 new coro­n­avirus pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Among them, six were iden­ti­fied as con­tacts of pre­vi­ous cases and had been quar­an­tined to pre­vent fur­ther trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>They were tested dur­ing their quar­an­tine pe­riod, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing 14 cases were de­tected through sur­veil­lance test­ing, such as the ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries ev­ery fort­night.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of one case per day in the past two weeks, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of fewer than one case a day for the past fort­night.</p>
    <p>With 21 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,247 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the disease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 37 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal while 301 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>None is in in­ten­sive care. Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive died of other causes.</p>
