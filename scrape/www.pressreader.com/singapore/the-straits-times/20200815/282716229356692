    <p>PHOEBE SIN A HAPPY WIFE AND MOTHER: In an In­sta­gram post on Wed­nes­day, ac­tress and Miss Hong Kong fi­nal­ist Phoebe Sin shared her thoughts on mar­ried life and mother­hood, Ori­en­tal</p>
    <p>Daily News re­ported.</p>
    <p>Sin, 30, met her hus­band, 43-year-old ac­tor Ruco Chan</p>
    <p>(both right), when she was com­pet­ing in the 2016 Miss Hong Kong com­pe­ti­tion, in which he was a guest judge.</p>
    <p>The two hit it off and dated for two years be­fore ty­ing the knot in Oc­to­ber 2018. They wel­comed their daugh­ter Quinta (far right) in April last year.</p>
    <p>“Since be­com­ing a mother, I some­times get com­ments that I no longer have to work and can just stay with my baby at home. That is true to an ex­tent,” wrote Sin, who cut down on projects after her daugh­ter’s birth.</p>
    <p>“I get to see Quinta grow up and tak­ing care of my hus­band brings me sat­is­fac­tion.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, she ad­mits that be­ing home too of­ten can be sti­fling and stul­ti­fy­ing.</p>
    <p>“In the quiet pe­ri­ods be­tween the busy­ness of ev­ery­day life and when you are left alone with your thoughts – that was con­fus­ing for me.”</p>
    <p>What helped her get out of the rut were books and movies, which she said ex­panded her world view.</p>
    <p>“I want to be a happy mother and bring vi­tal­ity into my home. It’s in the quiet mo­ments of a busy day that you get to do what you want to do,” she said.</p>
    <p>She also posted an image of her­self at work and wrote: “This is the most re­cent work photo. I was very mo­ti­vated at work that day. Only a mother with a broad world view can give her chil­dren a good education.”</p>
