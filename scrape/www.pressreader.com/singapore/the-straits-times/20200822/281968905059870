    <p>Be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic, older adults in Sin­ga­pore faced many chal­lenges, in­clud­ing iso­la­tion and lone­li­ness, mo­bil­ity and move­ment, and care co­or­di­na­tion. All of these chal­lenges have been am­pli­fied by the pan­demic and cir­cuit breaker re­stric­tions. The sil­ver lin­ing of Covid-19 for Sin­ga­pore’s el­derly pop­u­la­tion is that now ev­ery­one faces these same chal­lenges and is work­ing to­gether to find so­lu­tions that will out­last the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>AC­CEL­ER­AT­ING TECH ADOP­TION</p>
    <p>The cir­cuit breaker pe­riod high­lighted the im­por­tance of adapt­ing to new tech­nolo­gies in or­der to con­nect with fam­ily, friends and col­leagues. Recog­nis­ing these needs and chal­lenges, the Sin­ga­pore Govern­ment set up a high-level Min­is­te­rial Com­mit­tee for Dig­i­tal Trans­for­ma­tion to ac­cel­er­ate Sin­ga­pore’s adop­tion of dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies that sup­port how peo­ple work, live and play. Tech­no­log­i­cal lit­er­acy and ac­cep­tance have grown ex­po­nen­tially among all parts of so­ci­ety, even among the el­derly. These in­ter­ac­tions can be key to staving off anx­i­ety and de­pres­sion, which can be caused by iso­la­tion at home.</p>
    <p>THE RISE OF TELEMEDICI­NE</p>
    <p>One pos­i­tive im­prove­ment brought about by the cir­cuit breaker mea­sures has been the growth of op­tions in and ac­cel­er­a­tion of adop­tion of es­sen­tial home-based tele­health and telemedici­ne ser­vices. From gen­eral check-ups to on­go­ing mon­i­tor­ing, dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies that en­able home-based health ser­vices will con­sti­tute an im­por­tant pil­lar in a so­ci­ety’s abil­ity to pro­tect and serve vul­ner­a­ble res­i­dents. These have en­abled per­son­alised health ser­vices to be re­motely de­liv­ered to peo­ple no mat­ter their lo­ca­tion – a safer and more com­fort­able op­tion for many peo­ple. Tele­health tech­nolo­gies en­able physi­cians, pa­tients and fam­i­lies to re­main con­nected, in­formed and ed­u­cated with­out un­due risks. They al­low for more fre­quent and flex­i­ble in­ter­ac­tions, min­imis­ing po­ten­tially long wait­ing pe­ri­ods out­side of one’s home, which can be par­tic­u­larly help­ful to those who are frail and vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has been a cat­a­lyst for the growth of re­cent tele­health and telemedici­ne tech­nolo­gies. In­sti­tu­tions across var­i­ous in­dus­tries and sec­tors are work­ing on so­lu­tions to im­prove pa­tient ex­pe­ri­ence and de­liver more per­son­alised care, even those com­pa­nies not tra­di­tion­ally as­so­ci­ated with health­care.</p>
    <p>From in­dus­try gi­ants J.P. Mor­gan, Berk­shire Hath­away and Ama­zon’s joint health­care ven­ture Haven to lo­cal uni­ver­sity Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Uni­ver­sity’s Age­ing Re­search In­sti­tute for So­ci­ety and Ed­u­ca­tion’s (Arise) an­nual</p>
    <p>In­dus­try and Com­mu­nity En­gage­ment Event, peo­ple ev­ery­where are find­ing value in so­lu­tions that pro­vide im­me­di­ate care. Arise’s event last year, which was ti­tled Geron­tech­nol­ogy In Sin­ga­pore: Re­search And Prac­tice, show­cased stu­dent and fac­ulty projects serv­ing home-based adults. Rec­om­men­da­tions in­cluded a whole-of-so­ci­ety col­lab­o­ra­tion to re­verse the neg­a­tive im­pli­ca­tions of the “sil­ver tsunami”, and turn them into golden op­por­tu­ni­ties as so­ci­eties look into in­no­va­tive ser­vices en­abled by tech­nolo­gies geared to­wards the healthy longevity of all ci­ti­zens.</p>
    <p>THE SO­LU­TION FOR SIN­GA­PORE’S EL­DERLY: CRE­AT­ING A VIR­TUAL VIL­LAGE</p>
    <p>Im­prov­ing the age­ing ex­pe­ri­ence for older adults and cap­tur­ing the so­cial and eco­nomic ben­e­fits of the longevity econ­omy will re­quire so­ci­ety-wide trans­for­ma­tions at ev­ery level; it will take a vil­lage to care for our el­derly. But now, it can be a vir­tual vil­lage. Ac­cel­er­at­ing home-based health ser­vices de­liv­ered through new and in­no­va­tive dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies would sup­port the trans­for­ma­tions needed to care for older adults at home and cre­ate mar­ket in­cen­tives to de­velop and de­ploy such tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>Two un­der­ly­ing cul­tural fac­tors in Asia help ac­cel­er­ate the de­liv­ery and adop­tion of these new home-based ser­vices. First, the pri­macy of the fam­ily unit, es­pe­cially chil­dren, in sup­port­ing older adults pro­vides the im­pe­tus for tech­no­log­i­cal adop­tion. Fam­i­lies pro­vide the ini­tial push to adopt dig­i­tal tools and to teach the older adults how to use them. As more chil­dren find them­selves phys­i­cally dis­tanced from par­ents, such tech­nolo­gies al­low them to stay con­nected with their par­ents, pro­vide care for them and mon­i­tor their well-be­ing. Sec­ond, the de­sire for older adults to “age in place”, in their homes and com­mu­ni­ties they are com­fort­able with, en­cour­ages both ac­cep­tance and adop­tion of tech­nolo­gies that bring health ser­vices to them, and in­cen­tivises com­pa­nies to find ways to de­liver so­lu­tions to older adults where they want to be.</p>
    <p>For so­ci­eties ex­pe­ri­enc­ing rapid pop­u­la­tion age­ing, such as Sin­ga­pore, per­son­alised and home-based care built on dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies en­sures older adults re­main con­nected and pro­tected. If this pan­demic has shown older adults any­thing, it is that min­imis­ing their pub­lic ex­po­sure, es­pe­cially in crowded ur­ban ci­ties, helps pro­tect them against dis­ease trans­mis­sion and that home-based ser­vices pro­vide the an­swers for their needs. Gone will be the trips to clin­ics, hos­pi­tals and wait­ing rooms. In­stead, dig­i­tally en­abled, home-based health­care will be the new norm.</p>
    <p>This pe­riod of­fers an op­por­tune mo­ment for gov­ern­ments, health­care in­sti­tu­tions and com­pa­nies to ac­cel­er­ate ed­u­ca­tion, aware­ness and buy-in from older adults and their fam­i­lies. Con­di­tion­ing them to use these so­lu­tions dur­ing a pan­demic would help trans­late these be­hav­iours into long-term life­style choices and would en­sure that these so­lu­tions out­last the pan­demic.</p>
