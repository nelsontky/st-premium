    <p>•</p>
    <p>SAN FRAN­CISCO TikTok is urg­ing a fed­eral court to block US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump from ban­ning the video-shar­ing app, ar­gu­ing that the move is based on elec­tion pol­i­tics rather than le­git­i­mate na­tional se­cu­rity con­cerns.</p>
    <p>At­tor­neys were sched­uled to ar­gue the case yes­ter­day be­fore a judge, who will de­cide whether to put Mr Trump’s or­der on hold un­til a law­suit over the ban is re­solved.</p>
    <p>“As the Pres­i­dent’s and other agency of­fi­cials’ con­fus­ing and con­tra­dic­tory state­ments about TikTok over many months demon­strate, the pro­hi­bi­tions were not mo­ti­vated by a gen­uine na­tional se­cu­rity con­cern, but rather by po­lit­i­cal con­sid­er­a­tions re­lat­ing to the up­com­ing gen­eral elec­tion,” the mo­tion for a pre­lim­i­nary in­junc­tion con­tended.</p>
    <p>A deal to re­struc­ture the own­er­ship of the popular app was thrown into doubt on Mon­day when Mr Trump vowed to block any deal that al­lows its Chi­nese par­ent firm to re­tain any con­trol.</p>
    <p>The com­ments raised fresh con­cerns over a deal that ap­peared to avert a US-or­dered ban of TikTok, which the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has called a na­tional se­cu­rity risk and has threat­ened to ban without own­er­ship changes.</p>
    <p>The deal would make Sil­i­con Val­ley gi­ant Or­a­cle the data part­ner for TikTok, with re­tail gi­ant Wal­mart also tak­ing a mi­nor­ity stake in a new en­tity to be called TikTok Global.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump on Mon­day told Fox News that TikTok’s Chi­nese par­ent firm ByteDance “will have noth­ing to do with it, and if they do, then we just won’t make the deal”.</p>
    <p>Or­a­cle and Wal­mart “are go­ing to own the con­trol­ling in­ter­est”, added the US Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­thing is go­ing to be moved into a cloud done by Or­a­cle... and it’s go­ing to be con­trolled – to­tally con­trolled – by Or­a­cle.”</p>
    <p>Later in the day, Mr Trump told re­porters that the deal was “work­ing its way through”, adding that “I’ve given a pre­lim­i­nary OK”.</p>
    <p>The mo­tion ar­gued that TikTok would suf­fer “dev­as­tat­ing harm” from which it could not re­cover if Mr Trump’s ban is found to be un­law­ful.</p>
    <p>The US gov­ern­ment’s con­duct has been “ar­bi­trary and capri­cious in mul­ti­ple re­spects”, and Mr Trump’s ban vi­o­lates the Con­sti­tu­tion, ac­cord­ing to the fil­ing.</p>
    <p>TikTok – which be­came a global phe­nom­e­non with its brand of short, ad­dic­tive phone videos – has some 100 mil­lion US users.</p>
    <p>As US re­la­tions with China grew more con­tentious, Mr Trump be­gan tar­get­ing TikTok, the fil­ing read.</p>
    <p>TikTok is also in Mr Trump’s crosshairs be­cause of re­ports that users used the app to co­or­di­nate mass ticket reser­va­tions for a rally of his in Tulsa, re­sult­ing in an em­bar­rass­ment when sig­nif­i­cantly fewer peo­ple showed up for the event, ac­cord­ing to the mo­tion.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, ByteDance has ap­plied for a licence in China in line with the coun­try’s tech ex­port re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>The Bei­jing-based firm sub­mit­ted the ap­pli­ca­tion to Bei­jing’s mu­nic­i­pal com­merce bureau and is await­ing a de­ci­sion, it said on its Toutiao on­line news plat­form yes­ter­day, without re­fer­ring to on­go­ing talks over its US op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The ap­pli­ca­tion comes about a month af­ter China re­vised its list of tech­nolo­gies sub­ject to ex­port bans or re­stric­tions for the first time in 12 years, in a man­ner which ex­perts said gave the gov­ern­ment a say over any TikTok deal.</p>
    <p>It can take up to 30 days to ob­tain pre­lim­i­nary ap­proval to ex­port such tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>ByteDance has said its deal with Or­a­cle and Wal­mart, which will see the cre­ation of a stand­alone US com­pany, needs ap­proval from both the US and China.</p>
    <p>It added that it will es­tab­lish a US sub­sidiary called TikTok Global, of which it will own 80 per cent.</p>
    <p>But Or­a­cle and Wal­mart said ma­jor­ity own­er­ship of TikTok Global would be in Amer­i­can hands, com­ply­ing with an Aug 14 ex­ec­u­tive or­der by Mr Trump that ByteDance re­lin­quish own­er­ship of TikTok within 90 days.</p>
