    <p>A to­tal of 470,000 lower-in­come Sin­ga­porean work­ers who are on the Work­fare In­come Sup­ple­ment (WIS) scheme will get $810 mil­lion in Work­fare Spe­cial Pay­ment (WSP) this month, the Min­istry of Fi­nance said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Its an­nounce­ment fol­lows Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat’s min­is­te­rial state­ment on Aug 17, when he said the WSP el­i­gi­bil­ity will be widened to in­clude more than 70,000 ad­di­tional work­ers who will re­ceive WIS for work done this year, and who are not al­ready re­ceiv­ing the WSP.</p>
    <p>Th­ese work­ers will get the WSP of $3,000 from Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Most lower-in­come work­ers have qual­i­fied for the WSP ear­lier and re­ceived their first pay­ment of $1,500 in July for work done last year.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing pay­ment of $1,500 will be cred­ited di­rectly into their bank ac­count on Wed­nes­day, or mailed by cheque to their res­i­den­tial ad­dress by Nov 15.</p>
    <p>In­tro­duced in 2007, Work­fare is a per­ma­nent scheme to top up the wages of lower-in­come work­ers and help them save for their re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>Since then, $6.8 bil­lion in Work­fare has been paid to about 890,000 re­cip­i­ents, said the MOF.</p>
    <p>Tar­get­ing Sin­ga­porean work­ers whose earn­ings are in the bot­tom 20 per cent of the work­force, WIS is paid in the form of Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) top-ups for re­tire­ment, as well as cash to sup­ple­ment earned in­come.</p>
    <p>The scheme was en­hanced this year by rais­ing the qual­i­fy­ing in­come cap to $2,300 per month, and the max­i­mum pay­out to $4,000 per year.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, Mr Heng, who is also Fi­nance Min­is­ter, wrote that Work­fare and the Pro­gres­sive Wage Model are pol­icy in­no­va­tions to up­lift lower-in­come work­ers.</p>
    <p>“Through Work­fare, the Gov­ern­ment sup­ple­ments their in­comes with cash and CPF top-ups to pro­vide for both their im­me­di­ate and re­tire­ment needs,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that even more is be­ing done to help lower-in­come work­ers dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“The Gov­ern­ment is com­mit­ted to help­ing ev­ery Sin­ga­porean through this cri­sis, es­pe­cially our lower-in­come work­ers and the more vul­ner­a­ble among us.”</p>
    <p>Most lower-in­come work­ers have qual­i­fied for the Work­fare Spe­cial Pay­ment ear­lier and re­ceived their first pay­ment of $1,500 in July for work done last year. The re­main­ing pay­ment of $1,500 will be cred­ited di­rectly into their bank ac­count on Wed­nes­day, or mailed by cheque to their res­i­den­tial ad­dress by Nov 15.</p>
