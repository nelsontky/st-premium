    <p>The warm weather and rich mud­flats of Sin­ga­pore make the coun­try a trop­i­cal par­adise for many mi­gra­tory shore­birds – i nclud­ing those that make ar­du­ous jour­neys across the Hi­malayan moun­tain range, a new study has found.</p>
    <p>This find­ing puts Sin­ga­pore at the in­ter­sec­tion of two ma­jor fly­ways, the su­per­high­ways in the air that mi­gra­tory birds take ev­ery year to es­cape the win­ter chill in the North­ern Hemi­sphere.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, Sin­ga­pore was thought to be a stopover only along the East Asian-Aus­tralasian Fly­way, the world’s largest mi­gra­tory route, which runs be­tween the Arc­tic Cir­cle in the north and Aus­tralia and New Zealand in the south.</p>
    <p>But the new study showed that some birds which spend their win­ters in Sin­ga­pore jour­neyed here us­ing the Cen­tral Asian Fly­way across the Hi­malayas.</p>
    <p>The lat­est study was pub­lished last Fri­day in sci­en­tific jour­nal Na­ture’s Sci­en­tific Re­ports.</p>
    <p>It was co-au­thored by re­searchers from the Na­tional Parks Board (NParks), who had made their dis­cov­ery us­ing a suite of bird track­ing tech­nol­ogy de­ployed on com­mon red­shanks and whim­brels, two species of birds known to spend the North­ern Hemi­sphere win­ter months in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>About 2,000 mi­gra­tory shore­birds from more than 40 species stop over here be­tween Au­gust and March ev­ery year, vis­it­ing places such as the Sungei Bu­loh Wet­land Re­serve and Pu­lau Ubin.</p>
    <p>“This is the first time that shore­birds spend­ing their win­ter months here in Sin­ga­pore were shown to have mi­grated across the</p>
    <p>Hi­malayas,” said the study’s lead au­thor, Mr David Li, NParks’ man­ager for con­ser­va­tion at the Sungei Bu­loh Wet­land Re­serve.</p>
    <p>The lat­est find­ings pro­vide an­other clue to the mys­ter­ies sur­round­ing bird mi­gra­tion, a phe­nom­e­non con­sid­ered one of na­ture’s most spec­tac­u­lar, with the diminu­tive feath­ered trav­ellers tak­ing cues from the stars in the sky or land­marks on earth to make jour­neys span­ning thou­sands of kilo­me­tres.</p>
    <p>The five-year study from 2015 to last year in­volved tag­ging com­mon red­shanks and whim­brels in Sin­ga­pore with small, lightweigh­t satel­lite tags or ge­olo­ca­tors.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to data gleaned from 15 birds – 10 com­mon red­shanks and five whim­brels – four had nav­i­gated across the Hi­malayas at around 5,000m to 6,000m above sea level dur­ing the north­ward mi­gra­tion, while an­other three made the cross­ing dur­ing the south­ward mi­gra­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr How Choon Beng, NParks’ di­rec­tor for wildlife man­age­ment and out­reach, said that while hu­mans con­sider the moun­tain range a daunt­ing phys­i­cal bar­rier, it may not be as big a chal­lenge for birds.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers hy­poth­e­sise that those birds chose to fly across the Hi­malayas in­stead of skirt­ing the moun­tain range to re­duce fly­ing time, as the direct route re­duces the dis­tance to and from the birds’ breed­ing grounds i n the Qing­hai-Ti­bet Plateau by around 600km.</p>
    <p>Ms Yang Shufen, NParks’ di­rec­tor for con­ser­va­tion at the Sungei Bu­loh Wet­land Re­serve, said the lat­est find­ings have im­pli­ca­tions for con­ser­va­tion strate­gies for shore­birds.</p>
    <p>“The study il­lus­trates the value of con­serv­ing wet­land habi­tats, in­clud­ing man­groves, mud­flats and fresh­wa­ter marshes in Sin­ga­pore, to pro­vide mi­gra­tory birds us­ing ei­ther fly­way with feed­ing or roost­ing sites along their stopover here,” she said.</p>
    <p>She noted that many con­ser­va­tion ini­tia­tives in Sin­ga­pore fo­cus on the East Asian-Aus­tralasian Fly­way, with NParks es­tab­lish­ing part­ner­ships with other con­ser­va­tion agen­cies in na­tions along this fly­way.</p>
    <p>But the data shows that more part­ner­ships can be forged along the Cen­tral Asian Fly­way as well.</p>
