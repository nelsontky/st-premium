    <p>BANGKOK Thai­land is in talks with China to es­tab­lish a quar­an­tine-free travel cor­ri­dor by Jan­uary to res­cue its ail­ing tourism in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The agree­ment with Bei­jing will be sub­ject to the suc­cess of a lim­ited re­open­ing of the Thai tourism in­dus­try to for­eign trav­ellers this month, ac­cord­ing to Tourism Min­is­ter Phiphat Ratchak­it­prakarn.</p>
    <p>China, which ac­counted for more than a quar­ter of Thai­land’s tourist ar­rivals be­fore the pan­demic, will be the first low-risk coun­try the South-east Asian coun­try will sign up for quar­an­tine-free travel, he said.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent manda­tory quar­an­tine will be re­placed by coro­n­avirus test­ing and a mo­bile track­ing ap­pli­ca­tion for the Chi­nese vis­i­tors if the re­turn of for­eign tourists does not lead to fresh Covid-19 out­breaks, Mr Phiphat said. About 11 mil­lion Chi­nese hol­i­day­mak­ers vis­ited Thai­land last year, net­ting the coun­try about US$17 bil­lion (S$23.1 bil­lion), of­fi­cial data shows.</p>
    <p>Thai­land has strug­gled in its ef­forts to re­open its bor­ders to tourists due to op­po­si­tion from a sec­tion of the lo­cal in­dus­try and con­cern among the pub­lic that the gov­ern­ment is ill-pre­pared to deal with a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>But a pact with China may open the door to sim­i­lar travel agree­ments with places such as Ja­pan, South Korea, Sin­ga­pore and Tai­wan, said Mr Phiphat.</p>
    <p>“It can be a very happy new year as Thai­land’s travel high sea­son is the per­fect time to al­low peo­ple into the coun­try,” Mr Phiphat said in an in­ter­view in Bangkok on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“Most Chi­nese vis­i­tors come to Thai­land for a week, so be­ing quar­an­tined would not be worth the trip for many.”</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter ex­pects tourist ar­rivals to to­tal five mil­lion to 10 mil­lion next year, com­pared with an es­ti­mated seven mil­lion this year.</p>
    <p>While Thai­land has weath­ered the virus out­break bet­ter than most other South-east Asian na­tions, the pan­demic has dev­as­tated its tourism in­dus­try, which net­ted more than US$60 bil­lion in rev­enue from about 40 mil­lion vis­i­tors last year.</p>
    <p>“China has about 800 mil­lion peo­ple in 22 prov­inces that have been free from in­fec­tions,” Mr Phiphat said. “If we can at­tract even just 1 per cent of those peo­ple to travel here, that would al­ready be plenty.”</p>
    <p>The first group of vis­i­tors from China un­der a pre­vi­ously an­nounced long-term tourist visa pro­gramme will ar­rive in Bangkok on Tues­day, the min­is­ter said.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment ex­pects to is­sue about 1,200 visas a month un­der the pro­gramme to help the in­dus­try that is reel­ing from no for­eign tourist ar­rivals for five months in a row.</p>
    <p>Thai­land is also grap­pling with mount­ing anti-gov­ern­ment protests, prompt­ing the au­thor­i­ties to im­pose a state of emer­gency in Bangkok on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>But that will not stop the gov­ern­ment from eas­ing visa curbs, Mr Phiphat said. “I am con­cerned, but I am con­fi­dent that an un­der­stand­ing can be reached and it won’t be­come vi­o­lent,” he said.</p>
