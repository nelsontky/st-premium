    <p>To help firms re­tain their work­ers amid Sin­ga­pore’s worst re­ces­sion since in­de­pen­dence, more than $5.5 bil­lion will be paid out to more than 140,000 em­ploy­ers un­der the Jobs Sup­port Scheme from Oct 29. It will help busi­nesses pay the wages of about 1.9 mil­lion lo­cal em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>To help firms re­tain their work­ers amid Sin­ga­pore’s worst re­ces­sion since in­de­pen­dence, over $5.5 bil­lion will be paid out to more than 140,000 em­ploy­ers un­der the Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS) from Oct 29.</p>
    <p>It will help busi­nesses pay the wages of about 1.9 mil­lion lo­cal em­ploy­ees, the Min­istry of Fi­nance (MOF) said yes­ter­day in a joint state­ment with the In­land Rev­enue Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (Iras).</p>
    <p>This is the third round of pay­outs this year, bring­ing the to­tal amount dis­bursed un­der the scheme to over $21.5 bil­lion. The next pay­out is due in March.</p>
    <p>In­tro­duced in the first Bud­get sup­port pack­age in Fe­bru­ary and en­hanced in suc­ces­sive pack­ages, the wage sub­sidy ap­plies to the first $4,600 of gross monthly wages paid to each Sin­ga­porean or per­ma­nent res­i­dent em­ployee.</p>
    <p>The scheme was re­cently ex­tended to cover wages paid up to March next year for firms in harder-hit sec­tors, and up to De­cem­ber this year for sec­tors which are man­ag­ing well.</p>
    <p>Post­ing on Face­book yes­ter­day, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat urged all em­ploy­ers to do their best to re­tain their work­ers dur­ing this dif­fi­cult pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“Jobs re­main a key pri­or­ity as we con­tinue to sup­port our work­ers and busi­nesses through this cri­sis,” he said. “For busi­nesses that con­tinue to grow, we also have the Jobs Growth In­cen­tive to en­cour­age the hir­ing of lo­cal work­ers, espe­cially those in their mid­dle age.”</p>
    <p>Mr Heng, who is also Fi­nance Min­is­ter, had said in Au­gust that re­trench­ments will be in­evitable de­spite the Gov­ern­ment’s best ef­forts.</p>
    <p>His lat­est post also comes on the back of the Na­tional Wages Coun­cil last week giv­ing em­ploy­ers the goa­head to im­ple­ment tem­po­rary wage cuts, if it means sav­ing jobs. It ad­vised them to make only the re­duc­tions that were nec­es­sary to min­imise re­trench­ments.</p>
    <p>MOF and Iras said yes­ter­day that this month’s JSS pay­ment goes to­wards sup­port­ing wages paid to lo­cal work­ers from June to Au­gust, with em­ploy­ers in the avi­a­tion, tourism and built en­vi­ron­ment sec­tors get­ting the top tier of 75 per cent sup­port.</p>
    <p>Firms in in­dus­tries that were not al­lowed to re­sume on-site op­er­a­tions after the cir­cuit breaker, which ended on June 1, will have their sup­port lev­els topped up to 75 per cent for the pe­riod that they were not al­lowed to re­sume op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses that ben­e­fited from the scheme said they ap­pre­ci­ated the sup­port.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim Chee Kean, chief ex­ec­u­tive of In­ter­net of Things so­lu­tions provider As­cent So­lu­tions, said many of the firm’s over­seas projects were grounded due to the pan­demic. “JSS of­fered us sup­port to re­tain crit­i­cal jobs, as em­ploy­ees were un­able to travel to un­der­take in­ter­na­tional projects,” he said.</p>
    <p>Some felt the scheme must now tar­get those that need the most help.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion chief ex­ec­u­tive Ho Meng Kit said that due to on­go­ing travel re­stric­tions, more sup­port, such as an ex­ten­sion of the JSS be­yond March next year, may still be needed to keep busi­nesses in the avi­a­tion and tourism sec­tors afloat.</p>
    <p>“Con­versely... busi­nesses in sec­tors such as F&B and re­tail may re­cover at a faster pace when do­mes­tic de­mand picks up as more eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties re­sume. Like­wise, man­u­fac­tur­ing may also see op­ti­mistic signs as global de­mand grad­u­ally re­cov­ers,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, OCBC Bank head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy Se­lena Ling is keeping an eye on how the econ­omy evolves from now un­til March next year. “The key is... if busi­nesses on the ground can cope in the in­terim.”</p>
    <p>El­i­gi­ble em­ploy­ers will be no­ti­fied by post of t heir pay­out amount, and can also log on to the myTax Por­tal to view the elec­tronic copy of the let­ter.</p>
    <p>Those with PayNow Cor­po­rate or Giro ar­range­ments with Iras can ex­pect their pay­outs from Oct 29. Oth­ers will re­ceive cheques from Nov 4, but can re­ceive their pay­outs ear­lier if they sign up for PayNow Cor­po­rate with their banks by Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Iras and the MOF also warned of se­vere penal­ties for at­tempts to abuse the JSS.</p>
    <p>TRANS­FOR­MA­TION CRIT­I­CAL</p>
    <p>We are deal­ing with a mov­ing tar­get, as there is still un­cer­tainty on when and how the eco­nomic con­di­tions will turn for the bet­ter. It will take more than the avail­abil­ity of a safe and ef­fec­tive Covid-19 vac­cine for the econ­omy to be re­stored to nor­malcy.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies and an­a­lysts have wel­comed the lat­est round of Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS) pay­outs to cush­ion the blow from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But some are wor­ried, say­ing the JSS alone will not be able to save some firms and jobs as the Gov­ern­ment can­not ex­tend the scheme across all sec­tors in­def­i­nitely.</p>
    <p>“To do so would de­plete the state cof­fers, and more im­por­tantly, dis­tort em­ploy­ment con­di­tions,” said Mr David Leong, man­ag­ing direc­tor of hu­man re­source firm Peo­pleWorld­wide Con­sult­ing.</p>
    <p>The JSS sub­si­dies cover wages paid up to next March, but at de­creas­ing lev­els start­ing last month.</p>
    <p>The hard-hit aero­space, avi­a­tion and tourism sec­tors will get 50 per cent of wages paid from Septem­ber un­til next March.</p>
    <p>As con­struc­tion ac­tiv­ity re­sumes in phases, those in the built en­vi­ron­ment sec­tor will get 50 per cent of wages paid in Septem­ber and Oc­to­ber, and then 30 per cent of wages paid un­til next March.</p>
    <p>Sec­tors that are man­ag­ing well, such as bio­med­i­cal sciences and pre­ci­sion en­gi­neer­ing, will get 10 per cent of wages paid un­til De­cem­ber, while other firms will re­ceive 10 per cent of wages paid un­til next March.</p>
    <p>But in the light of the Na­tional Wages Coun­cil’s lat­est guide­lines, sev­eral an­a­lysts said it is un­cer­tain whether com­pa­nies will main­tain em­ploy­ees’ wage lev­els.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil last week gave em­ploy­ers the go-ahead to cut wages tem­po­rar­ily if it means sav­ing jobs.</p>
    <p>In March this year, how­ever, it had urged com­pa­nies to re­duce non-wage costs first, as well as to press on with trans­form­ing their busi­ness and work­force so that they are bet­ter pre­pared to grow when the econ­omy re­cov­ers.</p>
    <p>But since then, Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy has slipped into re­ces­sion, shrink­ing by 13.2 per cent on a year-on-year ba­sis in the sec­ond quar­ter of this year. In Au­gust, the res­i­dent un­em­ploy­ment rate hit a high of 4.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>Tar­geted sup­port</p>
    <p>Still, the JSS has helped to ease the cash flow of pub­lic re­la­tions firm Asia PR Werkz in the last few months, said its man­ag­ing direc­tor Cho Pei Lin.</p>
    <p>“It gave us the con­fi­dence to re­tain all our 50 em­ploy­ees,” she said.</p>
    <p>Al­though busi­ness has im­proved com­pared with dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, it is still “some dis­tance away” from pre-Covid-19 lev­els, she added.</p>
    <p>Point­ing to the ta­per­ing off in JSS pay­outs, OCBC Bank head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy Se­lena Ling said it is a “pol­icy re­minder” that re­sources are not in­fi­nite.</p>
    <p>She sug­gested that they be cal­i­brated so that only those sec­tors that need help the most will con­tinue to re­ceive pay­outs.</p>
    <p>Be­yond next March, she said, the signs of dis­tress to look out for would be the data on non-per­form­ing loans, num­ber of busi­nesses clos­ing down, ap­pli­ca­tions for loan mora­to­ri­ums as well as fire sales of as­sets.</p>
    <p>’’ AS­SO­CIATE PRO­FES­SOR LAWRENCE LOH, direc­tor of the Cen­tre for Gov­er­nance, In­sti­tu­tions and Or­gan­i­sa­tions at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, urg­ing com­pa­nies to trans­form at a faster pace to re­main vi­able and not rely on the Jobs Sup­port Scheme as a per­ma­nent so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>Help for un­em­ployed</p>
    <p>Peo­pleWorld­wide’s Mr Leong said there is the prospect of a sharp spike in un­em­ploy­ment in the last three months of this year should weaker com­pa­nies go belly up.</p>
    <p>And if com­pa­nies down­size, May­bank Kim Eng se­nior econ­o­mist Chua Hak Bin said, more sup­port may be needed for work­ers.</p>
    <p>“Sup­port for jobs may have to shift to­wards sup­port for the re­trenched as more work­ers mi­grate to the pool of the un­em­ployed.”</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of Par­lia­ment on both sides of the House have, on sev­eral oc­ca­sions, sug­gested schemes like re­dun­dancy in­sur­ance or ex­pand­ing the cri­te­ria to qual­ify for the Self-Em­ployed Per­son In­come Re­lief Scheme, which pro­vides af­fected self-em­ployed in­di­vid­u­als with three quar­terly cash pay­outs of $3,000 each.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lawrence Loh, direc­tor of the Cen­tre for Gov­er­nance, In­sti­tu­tions and Or­gan­i­sa­tions at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, cau­tioned against re­ly­ing on the JSS as a per­ma­nent so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>Rather, it is im­por­tant for com­pa­nies to trans­form at a faster pace to re­main vi­able, he said.</p>
    <p>“We are deal­ing with a mov­ing tar­get, as there is still un­cer­tainty on when and how the eco­nomic con­di­tions will turn for the bet­ter.</p>
    <p>“It will take more than the avail­abil­ity of a safe and ef­fec­tive Covid-19 vac­cine for the econ­omy to be re­stored to nor­malcy.”</p>
