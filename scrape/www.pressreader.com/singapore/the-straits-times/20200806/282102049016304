    <p>Cer­tifi­cates of en­ti­tle­ment (COE) re­bounded across the board at the lat­est ten­der yes­ter­day on the back of a smaller quota.</p>
    <p>The COE pre­mium for cars up to 1,600cc and 130bhp fin­ished 0.9 per cent higher at $33,000. The COE pre­mium for cars above 1,600cc or 130bhp closed 6 per cent higher at $37,102 – its high­est level since Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>The price for the Open COE, which can be used for any ve­hi­cle type ex­cept mo­tor­cy­cles but ends up mostly for big­ger cars, ended 4.3 per cent higher at $36,502. This is also its high­est since Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>The com­mer­cial ve­hi­cle COE price ended 0.9 per cent higher at $24,100. The motorcycle pre­mium fin­ished 18.3 per cent higher at $7,701.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try watch­ers at­tribute the all-round in­crease mainly to a sharp shrink­age in COE sup­ply for the Au­gust to Oc­to­ber pe­riod. They point out, how­ever, that the price in­creases were small in re­la­tion to the sup­ply con­trac­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Neo Nam Heng, chair­man of di­ver­si­fied mo­tor group Prime, said: “If these were nor­mal times, COE prices would have shot up by a lot more.”</p>
    <p>Mr Nicholas Wong, gen­eral man­ager of Honda agent Kah Mo­tor, said “mar­ket sen­ti­ment is still bad” and pointed to the num­ber of bids sub­mit­ted for car COEs, which fell by 18 per cent to 4,816.</p>
    <p>He at­trib­uted the dou­ble-digit spike in mo­tor­bike COE to an al­most 50 per cent shrink­age in the quota for two-wheel­ers. And be­cause of that, “deal­ers who are able to hoard are go­ing all out to hoard”.</p>
    <p>Motorcycle in­dus­try play­ers said that with­out change to the cur­rent sys­tem which is open to spec­u­la­tion, pre­mi­ums will con­tinue to be at the mercy of big­ger deal­ers.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Neo said con­sumers should not rush to buy now, adding: “There is no need for panic, there will be am­ple sup­ply ahead.”</p>
    <p>He said the lat­est price in­creases were partly due to buy­ers will­ing to “top up” on COE pre­mi­ums for fear of not be­ing able to se­cure the cars they have booked.</p>
