    <p>The global fight against Covid-19 re­ceived a boost on Mon­day with the re­lease of en­cour­ag­ing find­ings from hu­man tri­als of three coro­n­avirus vac­cines, in­clud­ing a closely watched one be­ing de­vel­oped by Ox­ford Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>The re­sults showed that the vac­cines be­ing tested did not cause any dan­ger­ous side ef­fects, and that they could coax a pro­tec­tive re­sponse from the hu­man body.</p>
    <p>But ex­perts said that while the re­sults were en­cour­ag­ing, much more work is still needed to plug re­main­ing gaps in knowl­edge be­fore a vac­cine can be made com­mer­cially avail­able.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at a me­dia con­fer­ence on Mon­day, Dr Michael Ryan, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s health emer­gen­cies pro­gramme, noted that the find­ings were from tri­als in their early stages and the data is very new.</p>
    <p>“We now need to move into larger-scale, real-world tri­als,” he said. “But it is good to see more data, and more prod­ucts mov­ing into this very im­por­tant phase of vac­cine dis­cov­ery, and we con­grat­u­late our col­leagues for the progress they have made.”</p>
    <p>The lat­est find­ings were from early phases of clin­i­cal tri­als for vac­cines be­ing de­vel­oped by Ox­ford Univer­sity and multi­na­tional drug­maker As­traZeneca; CanSino Bi­o­log­ics and China’s mil­i­tary re­search unit; and Ger­man biotech com­pany BioNTech and US drug­maker Pfizer.</p>
    <p>All three stud­ies – two were pub­lished i n med­i­cal jour­nal The Lancet, while the Pfizer study was pub­lished as a pre-print pend­ing peer re­view – found that the vac­cine can­di­dates could stim­u­late the body to pro­duce im­mune sys­tem “sol­diers”.</p>
    <p>These sol­diers, such as an­ti­bod­ies or T-cells, help the body fight off in­vad­ing pathogens.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Stephen Evans from the Lon­don School of Hy­giene and Trop­i­cal Medicine, noted that for the Ox­ford trial, the im­mune re­sponses mea­sured in the blood, and the ab­sence of se­ri­ous harms in­di­cate there is a pos­si­bil­ity of an ef­fec­tive vac­cine against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The Ox­ford vac­cine had prompted an an­ti­body and a T-cell re­sponse – both of which may be im­por­tant in the pro­tec­tion against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Prof Evans also noted that there were some gaps.</p>
    <p>“It does not yet show that the dis­ease is re­duced or pre­vented, and this will not be easy to show un­til Phase III tri­als have been com­pleted in set­tings where the (virus) is cir­cu­lat­ing at a high rate and people are get­ting clin­i­cal and se­vere dis­ease,” Prof Evans was quoted as say­ing in a CNN re­port.</p>
    <p>Clin­i­cal de­vel­op­ment is a three­p­hase process, said the US Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven</p>
    <p>tion on its web­site.</p>
    <p>In Phase I, small groups of people re­ceive the trial vac­cine, and this is ex­panded in Phase II to in­clude people who have char­ac­ter­is­tics, such as age and phys­i­cal health, sim­i­lar to those for whom the new vac­cine is in­tended.</p>
    <p>In Phase III, the vac­cine is given to thou­sands of people and tested for ef­fi­cacy and safety.</p>
    <p>In an up­date on Mon­day, As­traZeneca said late-stage Phase II/III tri­als are cur­rently un­der way in Bri­tain, Brazil and South Africa and are due to start in the United States.</p>
    <p>“Tri­als will deter­mine how well the vac­cine will pro­tect from the Covid-19 dis­ease and mea­sure safety and im­mune re­sponses in dif­fer­ent age ranges and at var­i­ous doses,” the com­pany noted.</p>
    <p>The find­ings from the three tri­als fol­low the pub­li­ca­tion last week of the re­sults of Moderna’s vac­cine trial, which showed sim­i­larly promis­ing early re­sults.</p>
    <p>Moderna’s vac­cine is sim­i­lar to the Pfizer one in that it also uses a mes­sen­ger RNA plat­form.</p>
    <p>There are cur­rently more than 150 vac­cine can­di­dates be­ing stud­ied world­wide.</p>
    <p>At a sep­a­rate press con­fer­ence last week, Pro­fes­sor Leo Yee Sin, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of Singapore’s Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Diseases, noted that most vac­cines can take seven to 15 years to be­come com­mer­cially avail­able, de­pend­ing on the pathogen.</p>
    <p>“For Covid-19, people are look­ing at 12 to 18 months, so this is still a space that we are watch­ing very closely,” she said then.</p>
    <p>“But there are a lot of in­ter­na­tional col­lab­o­ra­tions and ef­forts be­ing put in to see whether we can see an ef­fec­tive, us­able, de­ploy­able vac­cine for the hu­man race around the world.”</p>
    <p>GOOD PROGRESS</p>
    <p>We now need to move into larger-scale, real-world tri­als. But it is good to see more data, and more prod­ucts mov­ing into this very im­por­tant phase of vac­cine dis­cov­ery, and we con­grat­u­late our col­leagues for the progress they have made. ’’</p>
