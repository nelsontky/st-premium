    <p>The grad­ual re­sump­tion of events in the meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­ven­tions and ex­hi­bi­tions (Mice) sec­tor, in the after­math of the Covid-19 pandemic, is among seven ar­eas be­ing stud­ied by in­dus­try-led coali­tion groups that were set up in June.</p>
    <p>The Al­liance for Ac­tion (AfA) team that has been tasked with bring­ing back trav­ellers aims to take steps to re-es­tab­lish Sin­ga­pore as a lead­ing des­ti­na­tion for such events. It also aims to main­tain the coun­try’s po­si­tion as one of the top 10 cities in the world ac­cord­ing to in­ter­na­tional vis­i­tor traffic.</p>
    <p>This group is among seven in­dus­try-led al­liances con­vened by the Emerg­ing Stronger Task­force to work closely with the Gov­ern­ment and act on key growth op­por­tu­ni­ties. The oth­ers range from e-com­merce and ro­bot­ics to de­vel­op­ing Sin­ga­pore as a sus­tain­abil­ity hub or “Lit­tle Green Dot”. An eighth al­liance on medtech is be­ing formed.</p>
    <p>Up­dates on the work of the seven al­liances were given at a press con­fer­ence yesterday that was held by Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat and the task force’s co-chairs, Na­tional Devel­op­ment Min­is­ter Desmond Lee and PSA In­ter­na­tional group chief ex­ec­u­tive Tan Chong Meng.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said that in the past four months, the seven groups have held dis­cus­sions with more than 600 peo­ple from more than 330 or­gan­i­sa­tions, in­clud­ing busi­nesses, unions, trade as­so­ci­a­tions, social en­ter­prises and gov­ern­ment agen­cies.</p>
    <p>Un­like past ef­forts, the seven AfAs adopt a “start-up” ap­proach, in which they aim to take ac­tion and build pro­to­types quickly, while keep­ing an eye on op­por­tu­ni­ties in the longer term.</p>
    <p>Here is a look at some of their projects in the works.</p>
