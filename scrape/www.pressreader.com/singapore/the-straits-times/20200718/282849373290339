    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • There is more to be­ing a su­per­hero than span­dex and capes. There is also a lot of blood, sweat and dirt in­ges­tion.</p>
    <p>On the set of Cap­tain Amer­ica: Civil War (2016), An­thony Mackie, who plays Fal­con, learnt that su­per­hero train­ing mon­tages are just not as fun in real life.</p>
    <p>The 41-year-old was tasked with per­fect­ing a land­ing while pi­lot­ing Fal­con’s sig­na­ture me­chan­i­cal wings. He de­cided to bust out the phys­i­cal tips and act­ing train­ing he got while study­ing at The Juil­liard School. How­ever, he found that the­ory and ex­e­cu­tion are dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>On the first day of film­ing, Mackie says: “I was sup­posed to land, so they pulled me up like 30 feet off the ground, and I was on a pen­du­lum, so I was sup­posed to pull my legs un­der me and land to a stop.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t re­alise how much my lower body weighed, so I pulled on the ropes to try and bring my legs un­der, but I couldn’t get my core in and I lit­er­ally landed face first in the dirt and bounced for about 10 feet.”</p>
    <p>Mackie adds: “I had grass and mud all in my face. The crew was just dy­ing laugh­ing. Every­body was dy­ing laugh­ing.”</p>
    <p>The ac­tor joined a panel of Juil­liard alumni, in­clud­ing Os­car Isaac and Jes­sica Chas­tain, to re­flect on the lessons they learnt while study­ing un­der the per­form­ing arts con­ser­va­tory’s found­ing fac­ulty mem­ber, Moni Yakim.</p>
    <p>Yakim is the sub­ject of a new doc­u­men­tary, Cre­at­ing A Char­ac­ter: The Moni Yakim Legacy.</p>
    <p>Mackie says his teacher’s lessons were in­te­gral in shap­ing his ap­proach to Fal­con.</p>
    <p>“The phys­i­cal­ity of that di­rectly stems from the work – the phys­i­cal work, the clown work, mime work and body in­hab­i­tance – that we learnt in Moni’s class,” he says.</p>
