    <p>Hong Kong’s daily new coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions may have dropped to their low­est in seven weeks so far, but in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­perts be­lieve that cur­rent tough so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures have to re­main un­til fig­ures for lo­cal cases fall to zero or low dig­its.</p>
    <p>Such con­sid­er­a­tions have added to the cau­tion of the gov­ern­ment, which has pulled the plug on this year’s tra­di­tional Chi­nese New Year fairs, fur­ther mut­ing the fes­tiv­i­ties next month.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Ben Cowling from the Univer­sity of Hong Kong told The Straits Times that he be­lieves the Hong Kong gov­ern­ment should wait un­til there is no lo­cal in­fec­tion be­fore eas­ing rules.</p>
    <p>“I am con­cerned that if daily cases are not zero by Chi­nese New Year, we will risk see­ing a resur­gence in cases be­cause of the in­crease in fam­ily gath­er­ings,” he noted.</p>
    <p>Still, he thinks dine-in ser­vices at eater­ies can be re­laxed any time if op­er­at­ing ca­pac­ity is re­duced.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Hong Kong recorded 45 new con­firmed cases, of which 42 are lo­cal. Health of­fi­cials said an­other 40 pa­tients tested pos­i­tive in pre­lim­i­nary tests.</p>
    <p>The to­tal tally for the city has gone up to more than 9,150 cases and 155 deaths.</p>
    <p>Dr Le­ung Chi Chiu of the Hong Kong Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion said that if the city can re­duce the ef­fec­tive re­pro­duc­tive num­ber of the virus to less than 0.5 with cur­rent mea­sures and the num­ber of lo­cal trans­mis­sions by more than half each week, eas­ing of re­stric­tions is achiev­able. “Even if the trans­mis­sions in­crease twofold with the re­lax­ation, there will not be a re­bound in cases as the ef­fec­tive re­pro­duc­tive num­ber will still be kept be­low one,” he said.</p>
    <p>Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam has de­clared that she wants to re­duce lo­cal in­fec­tions to zero and her ad­min­is­tra­tion has tight­ened rules the past two months, with the lat­est mea­sures ex­tended un­til Jan 20.</p>
    <p>Public gath­er­ings are capped at two, while many busi­nesses in­clud­ing bars and gyms re­main shut. Dine-in ser­vices now end at 6pm, with only up to two pa­trons al­lowed per ta­ble. Schools are shut till af­ter Chi­nese New Year, which falls on Feb 12, and civil ser­vants con­tinue to work from home.</p>
    <p>A pa­rade usu­ally held on the first day of fes­tiv­i­ties has also been can­celled.</p>
    <p>Sec­re­tary for Food and Health Sophia Chan on Tues­day said the gov­ern­ment could reg­u­late pri­vate events, in­clud­ing gath­er­ings in peo­ple’s homes, to avoid cross-in­fec­tions of dif­fer­ent house­holds.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the gov­ern­ment an­nounced that the large-scale tra­di­tional Chi­nese New Year fairs will be can­celled in the light of the sever­ity of the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Dr Le­ung said most of the pri­vate home par­ties are fam­ily re­unions and while this con­trib­uted to the rise in the num­ber of lo­cal cases, con­tact trac­ing can be con­ducted for most of them.</p>
    <p>He also said this group of peo­ple did not ap­pear to af­fect the silent trans­mis­sions in the com­mu­nity ex­ces­sively over the past weeks.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, the num­ber of lo­cal cases with un­known source has been de­creas­ing pro­gres­sively with our con­trol mea­sures since mid-De­cem­ber de­spite these gath­er­ings dur­ing the mul­ti­ple fes­tive pe­ri­ods,” said Dr Le­ung.</p>
    <p>Both ex­perts ex­pressed op­ti­mism as Hong Kong awaits the gov­ern­ment’s vac­ci­na­tion plans, with the vac­cines ex­pected to start ar­riv­ing next month.</p>
    <p>Said Prof Cowling: “I hope Hong Kong would be able to get back to nor­mal af­ter we have vac­ci­nated 70 or 80 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion. I’m op­ti­mistic that could hap­pen by Septem­ber.”</p>
    <p>De­pend­ing on the sup­ply of the vac­cines, Dr Le­ung noted that the city could have enough only for high-risk groups, but that would at least re­duce the bur­den on Hong Kong’s health­care sys­tem.</p>
    <p>CON­CERNS RE­MAIN</p>
    <p>I am con­cerned that if daily cases are not zero by Chi­nese New Year, we will risk see­ing a resur­gence in cases be­cause of the in­crease in fam­ily gath­er­ings.</p>
