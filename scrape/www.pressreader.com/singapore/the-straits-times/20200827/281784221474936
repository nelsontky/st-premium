    <p>In the mar­ket­ing ma­te­ri­als of the Bel­la­graph Nova (BN) Group, Ms Evan­ge­line Shen is decked out in glam­orous gowns and jew­els.</p>
    <p>Her face is prom­i­nent on the com­pany’s web­site – which has now been locked to out­siders – and her pic­tures are also on the so­cial me­dia chan­nels of the com­pany and its re­lated en­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>When the BN Group – which she co-owns with Sin­ga­porean cousins Nel­son Loh and Ter­ence Loh – an­nounced it was mak­ing a bid for New­cas­tle United Foot­ball Club on Aug 15, she was very much in the pub­lic eye.</p>
    <p>But the for­mer lawyer from China has re­mained tight-lipped ever since some pub­lic­ity pho­to­graphs of her, the Lohs and for­mer United States pres­i­dent Barack Obama were ex­posed last week­end as hav­ing been doc­tored.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Ms Shen’s role in an­other com­pany – Catal­ist-listed Ax­ing­ton – also came un­der scru­tiny.</p>
    <p>The 32-year-old was ap­pointed non-in­de­pen­dent non-ex­ec­u­tive chair­man at Ax­ing­ton last month, fol­low­ing its takeover in June by the Lohs, her busi­ness part­ners.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change’s reg­u­la­tory arm ques­tioned how Novus Cor­po­rate Fi­nance, the con­tin­u­ing spon­sor of Ax­ing­ton, had as­sessed the “ex­pe­ri­ence, ex­per­tise, char­ac­ter and in­tegrity” of Ms Shen.</p>
    <p>Re­quests to speak to Ms Shen through her lawyers and sent to her e-mail over the past few days have so far been un­suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>The BN Group, said to be head­quar­tered in Paris, is reg­is­tered in Sin­ga­pore as Bel­la­graph Nova. It was formed in June through a merger of the Lohs’ Dorr Group and Ms Shen’s Bel­la­graph Group.</p>
    <p>Press state­ments de­scribe Bel­la­graph Group as a multi­na­tional com­pany with busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties across var­i­ous in­dus­tries, such as “lux­ury, con­sumer life­style, fi­nan­cial ser­vices and real es­tate”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there is no com­pany reg­is­tered as Bel­la­graph Group in Sin­ga­pore. Checks by The Straits Times’ China bureau also drew a blank in China.</p>
    <p>In many of the mar­ket­ing ma­te­ri­als the com­pany has put out, Bel­la­graph Jew­elry is said to be one of the “most well-known sub­sidiaries” of Bel­la­graph Group, with show­rooms in Van­cou­ver, Shang­hai, Hong Kong, Paris and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>A web­site lists Trump In­ter­na­tional Ho­tel & Tower Van­cou­ver as the lo­ca­tion of the Van­cou­ver show­room.</p>
    <p>Checks with the ho­tel showed that while Bel­la­graph Jew­elry had an out­let there, it is not a cur­rent ten­ant. In an e-mail re­ply, the ho­tel said: “We are no longer as­so­ci­ated with the Bel­la­graph Nova Group.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Au­thor­ity (Acra) records, Ms Shen – who is also known as Shen Che – set up Bel­la­graph SG, a jew­ellery com­pany, in June last year.</p>
    <p>Its reg­is­tered ad­dress, which is also the Sin­ga­pore show­room’s ad­dress, is at the high-end Hana con­do­minium in Tom­lin­son Road, in a unit owned by Mil­lenia Prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>Jew­ellers and gemol­o­gists whom The Straits Times spoke to said they had not heard of Bel­la­graph Jew­elry.</p>
    <p>This is de­spite a press state­ment claim­ing that it holds “the world record for high­est-ever on­line, sin­gle sale trans­ac­tion of US$102 mil­lion” for a piece of red di­a­mond jew­ellery.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic­ity ma­te­rial also claims it has “con­sis­tently ranked top glob­ally, in on­line jew­ellery trans­ac­tions” on e-com­merce plat­forms such as TMall, Alibaba, Taobao and Ama­zon.</p>
    <p>A check found that Bel­la­graph Jew­elry has a store­front on Chi­nese on­line mar­ket­place Taobao, which has not made a sin­gle sale.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view in 2017, Ms Shen was de­scribed as com­ing from an in­flu­en­tial fam­ily. The ar­ti­cle also said her hus­band’s fam­ily had been in the gem­stone busi­ness for a long time.</p>
    <p>While she is not well-known in jew­ellery cir­cles, she seemed to have shone more as a lawyer.</p>
    <p>Ms Shen, who passed her Bar exam in 2011 and was called to the Bar in 2012, has au­thored sev­eral pa­pers and was also from two of China’s top schools, Fu­dan Uni­ver­sity and Ren­min Uni­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>A Shang­hai l awyers’ data­base states that she has worked at Shang­hai Dong Lian and Jin Mao LLP as a lawyer.</p>
    <p>On a now-de­funct pro­file page on Jin Mao’s web­site, she is also said to have been a lawyer at Jones Day and a banker at UBS and Mor­gan Stan­ley be­fore join­ing Jin Mao, where she served as le­gal coun­sel for many large en­ter­prises.</p>
    <p>Much of her work in­volved deal­ing with pub­lic of­fer­ings, fi­nanc­ing, merg­ers and ac­qui­si­tions, pri­vate eq­uity and ven­ture cap­i­tal in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>A lawyer in China who co-au­thored a law book with Ms Shen when they were both in uni­ver­sity con­firmed yes­ter­day that Ms Shen had worked for sev­eral in­vest­ment banks af­ter leav­ing Fu­dan Uni­ver­sity’s law school in Shang­hai.</p>
    <p>She ex­pressed sur­prise when told of the New­cas­tle United bid, adding that they both had led sep­a­rate lives af­ter their book was pub­lished in 2010.</p>
    <p>Separately, when con­tacted, Ms Shen’s for­mer prac­tice Jin Mao in Shang­hai de­clined to com­ment. It still lists her as one of its lawyers on its so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the BN Group, Ms Shen is a share­holder of two in­vest­ment hold­ing com­pa­nies here, Rock Star Ad­vi­sors and Kona In­vest­ment, ac­cord­ing to Acra records.</p>
    <p>The two Mr Lohs are also linked to these com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>An ac­quain­tance who did not want to be named, de­scribed the three as like-minded in­di­vid­u­als with a pen­chant for mak­ing a splash.</p>
    <p>In a book she au­thored on pri­vacy in 2010, Ms Shen had mused about how pri­vacy should be a right en­joyed by all, and should be the foun­da­tion of all other rights and laws.</p>
    <p>In re­cent days, she would per­haps have felt that even more acutely.</p>
