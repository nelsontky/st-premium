    <p>AUSTIN • One per­son was killed when sev­eral shots were fired amid a Black Lives Mat­ter protest in down­town Austin, Texas, on Satur­day, said the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Footage posted dur­ing a Face­book Live stream showed the mo­ment when sev­eral shots rang out in the Texas cap­i­tal as about 100 peo­ple marched and chanted, “Fists up! Fight back!”</p>
    <p>Austin po­lice and emer­gency med­i­cal ser­vices said on Twit­ter that one per­son was killed dur­ing the shoot­ing.</p>
    <p>Ini­tial re­ports in­di­cate that the sus­pect was car­ry­ing a ri­fle and shot at the vic­tim, who was in his car, the po­lice told a brief­ing. The sus­pect has been de­tained, they said.</p>
    <p>Protests against racism and po­lice bru­tal­ity were sparked world­wide fol­low­ing the May killing of un­armed African Amer­i­can Ge­orge Floyd, who died in po­lice cus­tody in Min­neapo­lis.</p>
    <p>Mr Floyd died af­ter a po­lice of­fi­cer knelt on his neck for nearly nine min­utes while de­tain­ing him.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a group of heav­ily armed black pro­test­ers marched through Louisville, Ken­tucky, on Satur­day, de­mand­ing jus­tice for Ms</p>
    <p>Bre­onna Tay­lor, a black woman killed in March by po­lice of­fi­cers who burst into her apart­ment.</p>
    <p>Scores of the demon­stra­tors, car­ry­ing semi-au­to­matic ri­fles and shot­guns and clad in black para­mil­i­tary gear, walked in for­ma­tion to a fenced-off in­ter­sec­tion where they were sep­a­rated by the po­lice from a smaller group of armed coun­ter­protesters.</p>
    <p>The black mili­tia, dubbed NFAC, wants jus­tice for Ms Tay­lor, a 26-year-old emer­gency med­i­cal tech­ni­cian who died in a hail of gun­fire when drug investigat­ors bear­ing a “no-knock” war­rant en­tered her Louisville home four months ago. No crim­i­nal charges have been filed against any of the three po­lice of­fi­cers in­volved in the case.</p>
