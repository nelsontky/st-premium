    <p>WAYS OF GIV­ING AC­CESS</p>
    <p>What we want to do is to tell the so­cial ser­vice agen­cies to re­ally look at ways of giv­ing ac­cess to our vul­ner­a­ble com­mu­ni­ties, to the dig­i­tal tools, to skills, to con­nec­tiv­ity, be­cause that is the only way we can help them to re­main eco­nom­i­cally and so­cially ac­tive.</p>

    <p>PRES­I­DENT HAL­IMAH YA­COB, on en­sur­ing dig­i­tal in­clu­sion for vul­ner­a­ble groups.</p>
    <p>En­sur­ing dig­i­tal in­clu­sion of vul­ner­a­ble groups in so­ci­ety will be the theme for next year’s Pres­i­dent’s Chal­lenge, an an­nual fund-raiser for the less for­tu­nate.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob an­nounced the theme “Build­ing a Dig­i­tally In­clu­sive So­ci­ety” yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Tech­nol­ogy can be a huge, tremen­dous en­abler but tech­nol­ogy can also di­vide if it is not ac­ces­si­ble,” she said.</p>
    <p>“What we want to do is to tell the so­cial ser­vice agen­cies to re­ally look at ways of giv­ing ac­cess to our vul­ner­a­ble com­mu­ni­ties, to the dig­i­tal tools, to skills, to con­nec­tiv­ity, be­cause that is the only way we can help them to re­main eco­nom­i­cally and so­cially ac­tive.”</p>
    <p>Ex­am­ples in­clude us­ing tech­nol­ogy to en­gage with se­niors who are iso­lated dur­ing the pan­demic, or us­ing data an­a­lyt­ics to pro­vide bet­ter ser­vice sup­port for ben­e­fi­cia­ries.</p>
    <p>Fund­ing from the Pres­i­dent’s Chal­lenge 2021 will be dis­bursed in two tranches in­stead of one. The first dis­burse­ment of 30 per cent will be in March next year, and the re­main­der in March 2022.</p>
    <p>This way, or­gan­i­sa­tions and their pro­grammes can get fund­ing ear­lier, as many of them have been strug­gling amid the Covid-19 out­break. Ap­pli­ca­tions for fund­ing are open from Mon­day to Sept 25.</p>
    <p>Madam Hal­imah was speak­ing to the me­dia after a visit to Swiss­founded per­fumery com­pany Fir­menich at Sci­ence Park 1 in Kent Ridge, which pro­duces scents for hair­care, sk­in­care and fab­ric.</p>
    <p>The firm had pledged its com­mit­ment to di­ver­sity and sup­port for peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties in the work­place by sign­ing the Pres­i­dent’s Chal­lenge En­abling Em­ploy­ment Pledge that was launched in March.</p>
    <p>Fir­menich chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Gil­bert Ghos­tine said: “We are hon­oured to sign the (pledge) as part of our com­mit­ment to creat­ing the most in­spi­ra­tional work­place, where all our col­leagues can thrive, re­gard­less of dif­fer­ences across phys­i­cal and cul­tural bound­aries, life­styles and ex­pe­ri­ences.”</p>
    <p>Fir­menich cur­rently em­ploys 11 sen­sory pan­el­lists here, six of whom have vis­ual im­pair­ment and use dig­i­tal as­sis­tive de­vices in the course of their work, test­ing prod­ucts. It has 277 em­ploy­ees here.</p>
    <p>Madam Hal­imah met some of the sen­sory pan­el­lists, who showed her how they would de­scribe and eval­u­ate the scent of a prod­uct.</p>
    <p>One of them, Mr Muham­mad Zahier, lost most of his sight at age 19 due to a con­gen­i­tal con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>He has been work­ing with the firm for two years – an ex­pe­ri­ence he said he never thought he would have had after los­ing his sight. He added that he en­joyed the role and sup­port from his col­leagues.</p>
    <p>Mr Ra­jan Arul, the firm’s vi­cepres­i­dent of the per­fumery Asia busi­ness unit, said it re­cently adopted tech­nol­ogy, such as us­ing tablets and an in-house app, to in­crease per­for­mance and pro­duc­tiv­ity. De­scrip­tions of the scents are no longer hand­writ­ten, for in­stance, and are now in­put dig­i­tally to pro­vide more de­tails, and ac­cu­rate and ef­fi­cient data.</p>
    <p>Madam Hal­imah said: “I am en­cour­aged by Fir­menich’s ef­forts to de­velop de­vices and tech­nolo­gies to help (vis­ually im­paired in­di­vid­u­als) to be more con­fi­dent, en­gaged and in­de­pen­dent in their work.”</p>
