    <p>•</p>
    <p>It should come as no sur­prise, even in au­tumn and in the midst of a pan­demic, that Rafael Nadal and No­vak Djokovic will meet in another French Open fi­nal.</p>
    <p>Djokovic is world No. 1 and has not lost a com­pleted match in this dis­jointed ten­nis sea­son. Nadal is No. 2 and the great­est clay-court player in the game’s long history.</p>
    <p>Nadal will be aim­ing for his 13th French Open ti­tle to­day. Djokovic is hop­ing to win his sec­ond.</p>
    <p>Both ad­vanced on Fri­day with vic­to­ries over younger men who had rea­son to hope for bet­ter. Nadal won 6-3, 6-3, 7-6 (7-0) against 12th seed Diego Schwartz­man. Djokovic pre­vailed 6-3, 6-2, 5-7, 4-6, 6-1 against No. 5 Ste­fanos Tsit­si­pas.</p>
    <p>But to­day’s show­down – the 56th match in the rich ri­valry be­tween Nadal, 34, and Djokovic, 33, and their third meet­ing in the French Open fi­nal – will be about more than win­ning this unique Oc­to­ber edi­tion of Roland Gar­ros.</p>
    <p>It will be about the his­tor­i­cal peck­ing or­der. If Nadal pre­vails, he will equal Roger Fed­erer’s men’s record of 20 Grand Slam sin­gles ti­tles.</p>
    <p>If Djokovic pre­vails, he will nar­row the gap with his long-time ri­vals. The ti­tle would be his 18th and would make him the first of the Big Three to win each of the four ma­jors twice.</p>
    <p>Djokovic has the over­all edge against Nadal, with a 29-26 ad­van­tage, but Nadal leads by 17-7 on clay and by 6-1 at Roland Gar­ros.</p>
    <p>Djokovic is one of only two men to have de­feated Nadal in this tour­na­ment. Swede Robin Soder­ling beat Nadal in the fourth round in 2009, and the Serb beat him in the quar­ter-fi­nals in 2015.</p>
    <p>Nadal knows that, and is brac­ing him­self for to­day’s fi­nal.</p>
    <p>“I made a step for­ward to­day and played my best match of the tour­na­ment,” the Spa­niard said af­ter beat­ing Schwartz­man. “I will need one on Sun­day that is even bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>Djokovic is shoring up the for­ti­fi­ca­tions, too.</p>
    <p>“It’s his ‘mai­son’,” he said of Nadal, us­ing the French word for house. “I will have to be at my best. Play­ing Nadal at Roland Gar­ros is the big­gest chal­lenge in our sport.”</p>
    <p>Djokovic has cer­tainly had the harder road to the fi­nal. While Nadal has not dropped a set in six matches, he has dropped three in his last two.</p>
    <p>Sta­tis­tics aside, Nadal has al­ways been more in­ter­ested in look­ing for­ward to the next point, the next match, the next chal­lenge than look­ing back at all the cas­tles he has built on the clay. He be­lieves that none of that will mat­ter to­day.</p>
    <p>“Dif­fer­ent cir­cum­stances, dif­fer­ent kind of tour­na­ment and dif­fer­ent sit­u­a­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I can’t pre­dict the fu­ture... The only thing I know is to play against No­vak, I need to play my best.</p>
    <p>“I know that is a court that I have been play­ing well for such a long time, so that helps. But, at the same time, he has an amazing record here, too. He is one of the tough­est op­po­nents pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>Djokovic is hop­ing the dif­fer­ent con­di­tions at this au­tumn French Open will play to his ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>“I think that could be a bet­ter chance for me, ob­vi­ously the ball not bounc­ing as high over the shoul­der as he likes it usu­ally,” he said.</p>
    <p>“But, re­gard­less of the con­di­tions, he’s still there, he’s Rafa, he’s in the fi­nals, we’re play­ing on clay.”</p>
