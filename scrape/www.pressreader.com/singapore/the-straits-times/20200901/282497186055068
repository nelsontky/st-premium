    <p>SAN SE­BAS­TIAN (Spain) • The loss of two key strik­ers would have ended the hopes of many teams, but when you have an em­bar­rass­ment of at­tack­ing riches like Lyon, it is but a mi­nor an­noy­ance.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier in the sea­son, the French women’s cham­pi­ons lost for­mer Bal­lon d’Or win­ner Ada Hegerberg of Nor­way to a knee in­jury, while a red card for Eng­land’s Nikita Par­ris in the semi-fi­nal with Paris Sain­tGer­main saw her sus­pended for the fi­nal against Ger­man cham­pi­ons Wolfs­burg.</p>
    <p>Lyon were, how­ever, able to shrug off their ab­sence, on top of the in­jured French pair of Aman­dine Henry and Griedge Mbock, with ease, run­ning out 3-1 win­ners on Sun­day to record their fifth straight Cham­pi­ons League ti­tle.</p>
    <p>French­woman Eu­ge­nie le Som­mer opened the scor­ing and Ja­pan’s Saki Ku­ma­gai dou­bled their lead be­fore half-time, with Ger­man Alexan­dra Popp pulling one back, be­fore Ice­land’s Sara Bjork Gun­nars­dot­tir put the ic­ing on the cake late on.</p>
    <p>Lyon have now equalled the feat achieved by the Real Madrid men’s team be­tween 1956 and 1960.</p>
    <p>With all of their seven ti­tles com­ing in the last decade, this lat­est tri­umph con­firms their sta­tus as the finest team around, even as ri­vals around Europe step up their in­vest­ment in the women’s game.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple said it was the best time to play us be­cause we were miss­ing so many play­ers, but we were the best side in the first half by a long shot, and the game was al­most fin­ished at half-time,” Eng­land de­fender Lucy Bronze said af­ter­wards. “We’ve def­i­nitely got the strong­est squad in the world.”</p>
    <p>De­spite Wolfs­burg’s best ef­forts, there is lit­tle to sug­gest that Lyon will be knocked off their perch any time soon, and skip­per Wendie Re</p>
    <p>7</p>
    <p>Cham­pi­ons League ti­tles Lyon have won in the last 10 years.</p>
    <p>nard be­lieves the club’s suc­cess is a re­sult of the many hours spent on the train­ing ground.</p>
    <p>“It’s hard to be a win­ner, you have to work ex­tremely hard. You bat­tle year in, year out for this tro­phy. We’re bring­ing it back for the fans,” the France de­fender said.</p>
