    <p>MWithout my ex­po­sure to pub­lic speak­ing at JCU, I would find it much harder to speak to clients with con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>MS MIRA NATASHA</p>
    <p>Busi­ness devel­op­ment and sales ex­ec­u­tive</p>
    <p>En­able Busi­ness</p>
    <p>s Mira Natasha had al­ways dreamed of start­ing her own busi­ness. “Grow­ing up, my par­ents were very en­tre­pre­neur­ial and al­ways brain­storm­ing new con­cepts for busi­ness ideas, as well as dif­fer­ent mar­ket­ing strate­gies for their start-ups,” the 21-year-old says.</p>
    <p>The only thing stand­ing in the way of Ms Mira’s dream? Her painfully shy per­son­al­ity and lack of con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>To learn to break out of her shell, in 2016, she en­rolled at James Cook Univer­sity in Singapore, which would give her the op­por­tu­nity to in­ter­act with peo­ple from around the world and all walks of life.</p>
    <p>“JCU is an in­ter­na­tional univer­sity here that has a branch cam­pus. In ad­di­tion to re­ceiv­ing my de­gree faster due to JCU’s trimester sys­tem, I also wanted to ex­pe­ri­ence a holis­tic cam­pus life, and at­tend events and other non-aca­demic ac­tiv­i­ties. JCU pri­ori­tises both qual­ity of ed­u­ca­tion and stu­dent re­cre­ation, which was what I was look­ing for,” she says.</p>
    <p>In lieu of ju­nior col­lege, Ms Mira en­rolled in JCU’s Pre-Univer­sity Foun­da­tion Pro­gramme. She then pur­sued a bach­e­lor’s de­gree in busi­ness with a dou­ble ma­jor in mar­ket­ing and busi­ness man­age­ment — sub­jects that would be key to her en­tre­pre­neur­ial as­pi­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>A new per­son</p>
    <p>Be­yond aca­demic lessons at JCU, Ms Mira also dis­cov­ered a whole new side to her per­son­al­ity. “My ex­pe­ri­ences — meet­ing new peo­ple, work­ing with dif­fer­ent class­mates for projects, hav­ing to speak up dur­ing open dis­cus­sions in tu­to­ri­als and lec­tures — re­ally helped me to be a more open per­son, as well as gain more con­fi­dence,” she says.</p>
    <p>She also did mar­ket­ing in­tern­ships at events man­age­ment com­pany Rebel and Soul, and lux­ury life­style man­age­ment ser­vice Quintessen­tially. Her roles in­volved li­ais­ing with stake­hold­ers such as clients and part­ners ev­ery day, both on­line and face to face, which helped to shore up her con­fi­dence fur­ther.</p>
    <p>Af­ter grad­u­at­ing last year, Ms Mira joined hu­man re­source con­sult­ing firm En­able Busi­ness as a busi­ness devel­op­ment and sales ex­ec­u­tive. Her role in­volves in­ter­act­ing with clients reg­u­larly, from cold-call­ing to garner in­ter­est to con­duct­ing sales pitches.</p>
    <p>“With­out my ex­po­sure to pub­lic speak­ing at JCU, I would find it much harder to speak to clients with con­fi­dence,” she says.</p>
    <p>A good fit</p>
    <p>Ms Mira was also sur­prised to find that the knowl­edge and skills she had gleaned at JCU were so di­rectly ap­pli­ca­ble to her work.</p>
    <p>“I did not study busi­ness devel­op­ment and sales, but my busi­ness de­gree cov­ers many con­cepts and terms that I am now ex­posed to. I am so grate­ful to have stud­ied such a com­pre­hen­sive and ex­haus­tive de­gree pro­gramme,” she says.</p>
    <p>Her work su­per­vi­sor, op­er­a­tions man­ager Ki­ran Nalla, says Ms Mira’s strength lies in her pa­tience and com­po­sure when han­dling ac­counts and client ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>“She pos­sesses the spunk and savvi­ness of her gen­er­a­tion which en­livens her work en­vi­ron­ment, gal­vanis­ing the bonds be­tween her and her co-work­ers,” he adds.</p>
    <p>Ms Mira’s dream of run­ning her own busi­ness re­mains on the back burner for now, but with her new­found con­fi­dence and skills, she is well equipped to pur­sue it, should the op­por­tu­nity arise one day.</p>
