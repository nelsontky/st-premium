    <p>The woman who sued PUB for $5 mil­lion after she fell into a man­hole for­mally ac­cepted a set­tle­ment of­fer by in­sur­ers for the na­tional wa­ter agency yes­ter­day be­fore the High Court.</p>
    <p>Madam Chan Hui Peng, 47, had in­di­cated that she would ac­cept the of­fer, which had been on the ta­ble since Nov 10, on Thurs­day evening, after be­ing grilled on the stand over the past four days of the trial.</p>
    <p>The terms of the set­tle­ment of­fer are con­fi­den­tial.</p>
    <p>The char­tered ac­coun­tant frac­tured her an­kle after she fell into a 1.8m-deep man­hole in Si­mon Road, near Ko­van, on Dec 1, 2015.</p>
    <p>In her law­suit, she al­leged that the ac­ci­dent also caused her to suf­fer post-trau­matic stress dis­or­der (PTSD).</p>
    <p>Last month, she added a di­ag­no­sis of schizophre­nia in Fe­bru­ary to the list of in­juries that she at­trib­uted to the ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>PUB ac­cepted 70 per cent of the li­a­bil­ity for the ac­ci­dent but dis­puted her claims of PTSD and schizophre­nia.</p>
    <p>The trial opened on Mon­day and Madam Chan was cross-ex­am­ined by PUB’s lawyers, Mr K. An­parasan and Ms Grace Tan, from WhiteFern. The lawyers played surveil­lance footage of Madam Chan walk­ing nor­mally and showed her ac­tive Carousell ac­count to re­fute her claim that she was wary of strangers.</p>
    <p>They took her through pre­trial hear­ing tran­scripts to es­tab­lish her men­tal ca­pac­ity around the time her al­leged schizophre­nia symp­toms ap­peared. They also went through hospi­tal notes to show that she tried to get a psy­chol­o­gist to amend re­ports that her PTSD symp­toms did not amount to a dis­or­der.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day evening, Madam Chan’s lawyer, Mr Ivan Lee from Le­galS­tan­dard, told The Straits Times: “While our client would have liked to press on with the trial, the strain of the lit­i­ga­tion over the past four days has taken a toll on her men­tal health and emo­tional well­be­ing.”</p>
    <p>He added that Madam Chan has de­cided to ac­cept PUB’s of­fer and move on with her life.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr An­parasan told the court that he would be mak­ing sub­mis­sions on costs.</p>
    <p>He said there are cost con­se­quences aris­ing from Madam Chan adding schizophre­nia to her claim last month. The amend­ment re­sulted in more than a thou­sand pages of clin­i­cal notes be­ing filed and ex­pert wit­ness fees were in­curred.</p>
    <p>Mr An­parasan said he would also be mak­ing “strong sub­mis­sions” on Madam Chan’s con­duct, such as how she “thwarted me­di­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>An­other of Madam Chan’s lawyers, Mr L. De­vada­son, said these is­sues were raised be­fore PUB’s of­fer to set­tle.</p>
    <p>The lawyers told Ju­di­cial Com­mis­sioner An­dre Ma­niam that they would try to re­solve the is­sues, fail­ing which they will make sub­mis­sions in court on Dec 7.</p>
