    <p>SEOUL • K-pop girl group Black­pink are the big­gest pop band in the world, ac­cord­ing to the lat­est rank­ing by Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>This is the first time a South Korean band have topped the news agency’s Pop Star Power Rank­ings since they were launched in April this year.</p>
    <p>An­other K-pop group, the sev­en­mem­ber boy band BTS, are ranked No. 10 in the rank­ing this month.</p>
    <p>Late Amer­i­can rap­per Pop Smoke and Amer­i­can rap­per Cardi B are in sec­ond and third po­si­tions re­spec­tively, with Cana­dian singer</p>
    <p>Justin Bieber and late rap­per Juice WRLD round­ing up the top five.</p>
    <p>Black­pink com­prise Jisoo, 25, Jen­nie, 24, Rose and Lisa, both 23. The dif­fer­ent mem­bers can speak Korean, English, Man­darin, Thai and Ja­panese.</p>
    <p>Bloomberg said its Pop Star Power Rank­ings are based on six cri­te­ria, in­clud­ing al­bum sales, dig­i­tal song streams, YouTube views and to­tal in­ter­ac­tions on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the news agency, Black­pink have been the most pop­u­lar act on YouTube in the last few months, draw­ing more than 1 bil­lion views just last month.</p>
    <p>They are also the sec­ond most pop­u­lar act on Spo­tify, with their lat­est al­bum, The Al­bum, de­but­ing in the United States as one of the top 10 best­sellers af­ter be­ing re­leased last month.</p>
    <p>Bloomberg noted Black­pink made their mark in the US last year with a pro­mo­tional tour based on their per­for­mance at Coachella.</p>
    <p>The group made his­tory last year when they be­came the first fe­male K-pop act to per­form at the pres­ti­gious music fes­ti­val in Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>They re­ceived strong re­views from the lo­cal press and fur­ther boosted their global fan­dom with a tour of Europe.</p>
    <p>Bloomberg also said the US, Brazil and Mex­ico are three of the six big­gest mar­kets on Spo­tify for Black­pink’s new sin­gle, Lovesick Girls.</p>
    <p>The music video of the song has since been viewed more than 238 mil­lion times on YouTube.</p>
    <p>Other artists who have pre­vi­ously topped Bloomberg’s rank­ing in­clude Puerto Ri­can singer Bad Bunny, pop star Lady Gaga, Cardi B and Pop Smoke.</p>
