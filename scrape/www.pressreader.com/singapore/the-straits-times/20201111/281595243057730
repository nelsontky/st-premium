    <p>Al­most 200 Covid-19 vac­cine can­di­dates are be­ing stud­ied by sci­en­tists around the world.</p>
    <p>Of these, 44 are al­ready in clin­i­cal tri­als, which means they are be­ing tested on hu­mans.</p>
    <p>Here are some prom­i­nent can­di­dates in the Covid-19 vac­cine race.</p>
    <p>1 Duke-</p>
    <p>NUS and Arc­turus Ther­a­peu­tics: Lu­nar-Cov19</p>
    <p>This vac­cine was de­vel­oped by Sin­ga­pore re­searchers at Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School and Amer­i­can phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany Arc­turus Ther­a­peu­tics.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong from Duke-NUS said re­sults so far show that the po­ten­tial vac­cine could be ef­fec­tive as a sin­gle dose, which dif­fer­en­ti­ates it from many other Covid-19 vac­cines in de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Pre­lim­i­nary find­ings also in­di­cate pos­i­tive re­sponses in both safety and hu­man im­mune re­sponse.</p>
    <p>Later-stage clin­i­cal tri­als, which usu­ally in­volve thou­sands to tens of thou­sands of peo­ple across mul­ti­ple ju­ris­dic­tions or coun­tries, could start be­fore the end of this year.</p>
    <p>2 Pfizer and BioN­Tech: BNT162b2</p>
    <p>Data from an on­go­ing large-scale hu­man trial has shown that this ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cine de­vel­oped by the two firms is 90 per cent ef­fec­tive in pre­vent­ing Covid-19. It uses syn­thetic mRNA to ac­ti­vate the im­mune sys­tem against the virus.</p>
    <p>The po­ten­tial vac­cine is await­ing data on safety, which could come later this month.</p>
    <p>But it needs to be kept at mi­nus 70 deg C or be­low, which is a lo­gis­ti­cal ob­sta­cle as most hos­pi­tals do not have such stor­age fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine can be kept in an ul­tra-low tem­per­a­ture freezer for up to six months, or for five days at be­tween 2 deg C and 8 deg C – a type of re­frig­er­a­tion com­monly avail­able at hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>3 Moderna</p>
    <p>Ther­a­peu­tics: mRNA-1273</p>
    <p>A po­ten­tial vac­cine by the Mas­sachusetts-based drug com­pany, in col­lab­o­ra­tion with the United States Na­tional In­sti­tutes of Health, has also reached hu­man tri­als, hav­ing en­rolled 30,000 peo­ple at 89 sites across 30 US states and the Dis­trict of Columbia.</p>
    <p>The com­pany is still mon­i­tor­ing the re­sults of its phase two tri­als, which in­volve test­ing the vac­cine on those with the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Moderna had said in May that it was on track to de­liver at least 500 mil­lion doses of the vac­cine each year be­gin­ning next year, in col­lab­o­ra­tion with Swiss man­u­fac­turer Lonza.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in an in­ter­view with The New York Times in Septem­ber, the firm said the vac­cine is un­likely to be pub­licly avail­able in the first half of next year.</p>
    <p>4 Ga­ma­leya</p>
    <p>Re­search In­sti­tute of Epi­demi­ol­ogy and Mi­cro­bi­ol­ogy: Sput­nik V</p>
    <p>The Rus­sian Health Min­istry said on Mon­day that the vac­cine is more than 90 per cent ef­fec­tive, cit­ing data col­lated from vac­ci­na­tions of the pub­lic rather than from an on­go­ing trial.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia is rolling out the vac­cine for do­mes­tic use de­spite the fact that late-stage tri­als have not yet been com­pleted.</p>
    <p>It is pre­par­ing to pub­lish pre­lim­i­nary re­sults of an on­go­ing largescale hu­man trial in­volv­ing 40,000 peo­ple in Moscow this month.</p>
    <p>5 As­traZeneca: ChAdOx1 nCoV-19</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s As­traZeneca and the Univer­sity of Ox­ford have taken their po­ten­tial vac­cine to the fi­nal stage of clin­i­cal tri­als in other coun­tries, and are cur­rently look­ing for up to 50,000 vol­un­teers in to­tal from Brazil, the United King­dom, the US and South Africa.</p>
    <p>Pre­lim­i­nary re­sults from the first two clin­i­cal trial phases showed that the vac­cine trig­gered a strong im­mune re­sponse – in­clud­ing in­creased an­ti­bod­ies and re­sponses from T-cells – with only mi­nor side ef­fects such as fa­tigue and headaches.</p>
    <p>How­ever, tri­als were paused for a month due to a safety re­view on Sept 8, as a pa­tient had de­vel­oped an un­ex­plained ad­verse re­ac­tion. Tri­als restarted in the US a month later and are on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>6 Si­no­vac</p>
    <p>Biotech: Coron­aVac</p>
    <p>Chi­nese firm Si­no­vac Biotech’s vac­cine Coron­aVac, which uses a chem­i­cally in­ac­ti­vated ver­sion of the virus to trig­ger an im­mune re­sponse, has been un­der­go­ing the fi­nal stage of clin­i­cal tri­als in Brazil, In­done­sia and Turkey.</p>
    <p>But the trial in Brazil of 9,000 peo­ple was re­cently stopped by the coun­try’s health reg­u­la­tor, which cited an “ad­verse in­ci­dent” in­volv­ing a vol­un­teer re­cip­i­ent last month. The an­nounce­ment came a day af­ter a vac­cine by Pfizer and BioN­Tech was re­ported to be more than 90 per cent ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>Such pauses give reg­u­la­tors a chance to an­a­lyse risks that emerge dur­ing the course of the study and are not un­com­mon in large-scale drug tri­als, but China has al­ready started ad­min­is­ter­ing its vac­cines un­der an ex­pan­sive emer­gency use ap­proval.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Si­no­vac said it is con­fi­dent about the safety of its vac­cine.</p>
