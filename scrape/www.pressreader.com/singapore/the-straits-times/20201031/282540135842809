    <p>HOUS­TON • ExxonMo­bil will slash its global work­force by 15 per cent by the end of 2022, an un­prece­dented culling by North Amer­ica’s big­gest oil ex­plorer as it reels from Covid-19’s im­pact on en­ergy de­mand and prices.</p>
    <p>The cuts will in­clude 1,900 jobs in the United States, mostly in Hous­ton, as well as lay­offs pre­vi­ously an­nounced in Europe and Aus­tralia, and re­duc­tions in the num­ber of con­trac­tors, some of which have al­ready taken place.</p>
    <p>ExxonMo­bil yes­ter­day re­ported it lost US$680 mil­lion (S$928 mil­lion) in the third quar­ter, against US$3.2 bil­lion in profit in the year-ago pe­riod. The loss was its third straight quar­ter of red ink.</p>
    <p>It also said it plans to cut its cap­i­tal spend­ing for next year to be­tween US$16 bil­lion and US$19 bil­lion from a planned US$23 bil­lion this year.</p>
    <p>ExxonMo­bil’s job cuts, an­nounced on Thurs­day, means the com­pany will re­duce its 88,000 work­force by about 14,000 peo­ple, split be­tween em­ploy­ees and con­trac­tors, from year-end 2019 lev­els, spokesman Casey Nor­ton said. The cuts will come through at­tri­tion, tar­geted re­dun­dancy pro­grammes next year, and scaled-back hir­ing in some coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has a head­count of more than 4,000 in Sin­ga­pore, ac­cord­ing to its web­site.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted, a spokesman in Sin­ga­pore told The Straits Times that the com­pany is un­der­tak­ing a coun­try by coun­try re­view. “It would be pre­ma­ture to draw any con­clu­sions about Sin­ga­pore un­til the re­view is com­plete,” the spokesman said.</p>
    <p>ExxonMo­bil’s Big Oil ri­vals are also cut­ting thou­sands of jobs in re­sponse to the de­mand slump sparked by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. BP plans to slash 10,000 jobs, Royal Dutch Shell will cut as many as 9,000 roles and Chevron has an­nounced around 6,000 re­duc­tions.</p>
    <p>The fact that ExxonMo­bil is cut­ting jobs at all is a sign of its weak­ened fi­nan­cial po­si­tion com­pared to its for­mer sta­tus as the S&P 500 In­dex’s big­gest com­pany less than a decade ago and a profit pow­er­house used to rid­ing out oil-price cy­cles.</p>
    <p>This year’s down­turn has been par­tic­u­larly dam­ag­ing be­cause it af­fected re­fin­ing, usu­ally a cush­ion in times of low oil prices, and be­cause it came at a time when ExxonMo­bil was al­ready in­creas­ing borrowing to fund a large ex­pan­sion pro­gramme. The com­pany was forced to re­treat on th­ese plans in April, re­duc­ing cap­i­tal spend­ing by US$10 bil­lion and de­lay­ing or scal­ing back most of its ma­jor projects.</p>
