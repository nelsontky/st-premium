    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • New daily cases of Covid-19 surged in Negeri Sem­bi­lan state yes­ter­day with 374 cases re­ported in the last 24 hours, mak­ing it the state with the sec­ond high­est num­ber of in­fec­tions after Sabah.</p>
    <p>The Bor­neo state of Sabah, which has been the epi­cen­tre of the dis­ease in Malaysia for most of the last two months, re­mained at the No. 1 spot with 391 new cases, the Health Min­istry said.</p>
    <p>The surge in Negeri Sem­bi­lan – lo­cated to the south of the Klang Val­ley – mostly came from ex­ist­ing clus­ters, with four cases from close con­tact and other Covid-19 screen­ings, said the min­istry’s di­rec­tor-gen­eral Noor Hisham Ab­dul­lah.</p>
    <p>The Klang Val­ley – Malaysia’s most-densely pop­u­lated area com­pris­ing Se­lan­gor and the fed­eral ter­ri­to­ries of Kuala Lumpur and Pu­tra­jaya – logged 217 cases yes­ter­day. The coun­try’s com­mer­cial and in­dus­trial heart with some seven mil­lion peo­ple re­ported 563 cases on Friday, higher than Sabah’s 556 cases.</p>
    <p>The ap­par­ent race to log a higher num­ber of cases comes amid the third wave of the coro­n­avirus pandemic in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Nine of Malaysia’s 13 states and its three fed­eral ter­ri­to­ries – Kuala Lumpur, Pu­tra­jaya and Labuan – are cur­rently un­der stricter move­ment curbs, called a con­di­tional move­ment con­trol or­der (CMCO).</p>
    <p>Malaysia had re­laxed curbs on eco­nomic and so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties – un­der the so-called re­cov­ery MCO – in June, after three months of re­stric­tions had re­duced daily in­fec­tions to low dou­ble-dig­its.</p>
    <p>The CMCO bars in­ter-district travel ex­cept for work and emer­gency pur­poses, with mass gath­er­ings banned and the pub­lic re­peat­edly ad­vised through the me­dia to re­main at home. The po­lice have put up road­blocks along ma­jor roads.</p>
    <p>The coun­try yes­ter­day re­ported a to­tal of 1,114 new cases – the 14th con­sec­u­tive day where daily cases have gone above 800.</p>
    <p>The new cases bring Malaysia’s to­tal since the dis­ease has been tracked in the coun­try to 46,209.</p>
    <p>There were two new fa­tal­i­ties yes­ter­day, rais­ing the num­ber of deaths to 306.</p>
