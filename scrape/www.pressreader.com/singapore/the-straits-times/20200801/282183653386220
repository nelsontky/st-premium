    <p>Skip­ping or post­pon­ing med­i­cal ap­point­ments amid the Covid-19 pan­demic may be com­mon, but for peo­ple with a se­vere form of age-re­lated mac­u­lar de­gen­er­a­tion (AMD), do­ing so may lead to vision loss.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors at the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Eye Cen­tre (SNEC) say poor ad­her­ence to treat­ment is a world­wide phe­nom­e­non, but there is fur­ther proof that do­ing so can lead to vision loss.</p>
    <p>SNEC did a study, pub­lished late last year in the jour­nal Oph­thal­mol­ogy Retina, that “con­clu­sively demon­strated that ad­her­ence to timely re­treat­ment is im­por­tant to help pre­serve pa­tients’ vision”, said its lead author, Pro­fes­sor Gemmy Cheung, a se­nior con­sul­tant and head of SNEC’s med­i­cal retina de­part­ment.</p>
    <p>“It is well es­tab­lished that with anti-VEGF (anti-vas­cu­lar en­dothe­lial growth fac­tor) in­jec­tions, vision de­cline can be halted in about 95 per cent of the pa­tients, as long as ad­e­quate re­treat­ment is given,” she said, re­fer­ring to the drugs that need to be in­jected right into the eye to block the growth of ab­nor­mal blood ves­sels.</p>
    <p>SNEC’s study had looked at how 364 pa­tients with AMD, or a sub­type known as poly­poidal choroidal vas­cu­lopa­thy that is com­mon with Asians, fared with anti-VEGF ther­apy over a one-year pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The lo­cal study also sug­gested that the pa­tients here sought help later than those else­where, as they had rel­a­tively poorer vision when they did so.</p>
    <p>AMD is a lead­ing cause of vision loss among se­niors world­wide. It can start to af­fect peo­ple as young as in their 40s, though most cases oc­cur in those aged above 70.</p>
    <p>Most AMD pa­tients have dry AMD, a form that has no ef­fec­tive treat­ment but pro­gresses slowly.</p>
    <p>The rest – about 10 per cent – have the se­vere form known as wet AMD, which can lead to rapid and se­vere vision loss, but it can be treated.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, even be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic, not all pa­tients came for their treat­ments.</p>
    <p>Dr Kelvin Teo, a con­sul­tant at the med­i­cal retina de­part­ment at SNEC, said these pa­tients, who are mostly se­niors, may find it chal­leng­ing to keep up with the fre­quent treat­ments.</p>
    <p>“They need six to eight in­jec­tions a year on av­er­age, but about 30 per cent of them would bar­gain with us to come in less,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Teo said some pa­tients found that the in­jec­tions would give them red eyes for a day and did not like it.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, SNEC pi­loted a smart­phone tool to aid the self-mon­i­tor­ing of AMD, and had more than 800 sign-ups, of which five needed med­i­cal help.</p>
    <p>SNEC, he said, has since con­tacted “over 150 pa­tients with ac­tive dis­ease who have de­faulted, to en­sure they re­turned for their treat­ments”.</p>
    <p>The is­sue with the anti-VEGF in­jec­tion ther­apy is that it needs to be de­liv­ered right into the eye­ball, which some pa­tients may find har­row­ing.</p>
    <p>Anti-VEGF drugs are also ex­pen­sive, rang­ing from a few hun­dred dol­lars to more than $1,500 a jab.</p>
    <p>“We can’t put a lot of it in there,” said Prof Cheung, re­fer­ring to each in­jec­tion. “It’s like go­ing to the petrol sta­tion.”</p>
    <p>On av­er­age, a pa­tient will need eight to 12 treat­ments in the first year of the dis­ease in or­der to achieve the best out­come, as the ef­fi­cacy of each in­jec­tion is es­ti­mated to last for only four to six weeks, she said.</p>
    <p>Af­ter that, most pa­tients can main­tain their vision with fewer treat­ments in a year, she said.</p>
    <p>Prof Cheung, who is also head of the retina re­search group at the Sin­ga­pore Eye Re­search In­sti­tute, said pa­tients who are not able to keep up with the fre­quent treat­ments will usu­ally ex­pe­ri­ence a de­cline in their vision even­tu­ally, as the re­ac­ti­va­tion of the dis­ease is com­mon.</p>
    <p>“At first, the per­son with the dis­ease will find that there’s ‘a lit­tle bit of block­ing’ in the mid­dle of his vision,” she said.</p>
    <p>“If that’s not treated, the black blob will grow big­ger and big­ger, block­ing his cen­tral vision.”</p>
    <p>Dr Teo said pa­tients will ex­pe­ri­ence straight lines ap­pear­ing wavy as the first symp­tom of a new on­set of wet AMD. Al­ter­ations or the block­ing of cen­tral vision may also oc­cur, he said.</p>
    <p>The in­jec­tions can help slow the rate of vision de­cline or stop fur­ther vision loss. “In some cases, treat­ment also im­proves vision by re­duc­ing the wavi­ness or visual al­ter­ation,” said Dr Teo.</p>
