    <p>Par­ties al­lied to Malaysian Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin yes­ter­day openly clashed with their own al­lies over the 73 seats at stake in the Sabah state polls, ex­pos­ing in­ter­nal ri­val­ries just two days be­fore nom­i­na­tions.</p>
    <p>They aban­doned a joint event to an­nounce their can­di­dates yes­ter­day as they clashed over who should be chief min­is­ter if they won the Sept 26 vote. The event was in­stead re­named a gather­ing of lead­ers.</p>
    <p>Umno, which leads the Barisan Na­sional (BN) pact, handed out a list of 31 names to the press – which left out its in­flu­en­tial for­mer Sabah chief min­is­ter Musa Aman and in­stead in­cluded another for­mer chief min­is­ter, Datuk Seri Salleh Said Keruak.</p>
    <p>But Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s Perikatan Na­sional (PN) coali­tion, led by his Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia, later re­vealed 29 can­di­dates. Three of these will be con­test­ing against can­di­dates fielded from BN par­ties, which are meant to be PN al­lies.</p>
    <p>Ber­satu’s Sabah chief Ha­jiji Noor said there was still time to re­solve such mat­ters ahead of nom­i­na­tions to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Parti Ber­satu Sabah an­nounced it would con­test 15 seats, with eight over­lap­ping those claimed by other al­lies of Mr Muhyid­din, in­clud­ing three with Umno.</p>
    <p>While the state elec­tion does not di­rectly af­fect which coali­tion forms Malaysia’s fed­eral gov­ern­ment, it is a bell­wether of where voter loy­al­ties lie. Sabah, a swing state, is a po­ten­tial king­maker in a gen­eral elec­tion as it is rep­re­sented by 25 of the 222 law­mak­ers in Par­lia­ment, the third-high­est num­ber af­ter Sarawak and Jo­hor.</p>
    <p>Umno’s Sabah chief Bung Mok­tar Radin in­sisted that Tan Sri Musa, a ri­val for the chief min­is­ter­ship favoured by a fac­tion within Ber­satu, was not picked as he “never re­quested” a seat. Mr Musa was Sabah’s chief min­is­ter for 15 years un­til the Umno-led BN was ousted in the 2018 Gen­eral Elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Dis­cus­sions are equally fraught at the ri­val camp, with over­lap­ping claims ironed out only late yes­ter­day. The so-called Warisan Plus pact un­der out­go­ing Chief Min­is­ter Shafie Ap­dal went ahead with an­nounc­ing 66 can­di­dates yes­ter­day morn­ing – mi­nus those whom op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim’s Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat (PKR) is sup­posed to field.</p>
    <p>That left seven districts for PKR, which had in­sisted late on Wed­nes­day on con­test­ing in 14 wards, six more than the num­ber of seats it con­tested in 2018.</p>
    <p>But Datuk Shafie, who is pres­i­dent of Warisan, told re­porters that “we are quite pre­pared for what­ever con­se­quences we are go­ing to face”.</p>
    <p>Al­though PKR’s Sabah youth in­for­ma­tion chief Razeef Rakimin warned of a “protest vote when they see Warisan be­hav­ing like a party that is greedy for seats”, the state chap­ter even­tu­ally ac­cepted the deal.</p>
    <p>“The de­ci­sion was con­firmed and en­dorsed by the pres­i­dent of PKR and the party’s sec­re­tary-gen­eral (head­quar­ters) to sup­port the de­ci­sion of the lo­cal lead­ers in the best in­ter­ests of Sabah,” said PKR’s state chief Christina Liew.</p>
    <p>Mr Shafie and his PKR coun­ter­part, Datuk Seri An­war, are ri­vals at the fed­eral level, with both men vy­ing to be the op­po­si­tion’s prime min­is­ter can­di­date in the next na­tional elec­tion, which is widely ex­pected to be held by early next year.</p>
    <p>The Sabah state elec­tion was trig­gered af­ter Mr Musa drew de­fect­ing as­sem­bly­men to his camp, de­priv­ing Mr Shafie’s ad­min­is­tra­tion of a ma­jor­ity. Mr Musa had hoped to helm the state gov­ern­ment with the as­sem­bly­men aligned to him with­out go­ing to the polls. But the state gov­er­nor chose in­stead to dis­solve the as­sem­bly and call an elec­tion.</p>
