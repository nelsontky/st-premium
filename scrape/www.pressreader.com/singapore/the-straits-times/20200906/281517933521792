    <p>Even while re­tail ac­tiv­ity ap­pears to be slowly re­cov­er­ing as the econ­omy re­opens, busi­nesses pre­vi­ously fre­quented by mi­grant work­ers in ar­eas like Chi­na­town and Lit­tle In­dia con­tinue to bleed, with work­ers choos­ing to shop and eat closer to where they stay in­stead, caus­ing shops in central ar­eas to shut­ter as a re­sult.</p>
    <p>Checks last week found empty premises and shop own­ers won­der­ing when things will go back to nor­mal, if ever.</p>
    <p>A visit to Peo­ple’s Park Com­plex on Wed­nes­day and Fri­day re­vealed six to seven units closed on ev­ery floor with signs they were for rent. They in­cluded a money re­mit­tance out­let, two mo­bile phone and SIM card top-up stores and sundry shops.</p>
    <p>Ten­ants at Peo­ple’s Park Com­plex, Hong Lim Com­plex and other lo­ca­tions in Chi­na­town said they had been badly hit by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and busi­ness had not picked up even af­ter pro­gres­sive re­open­ing in phases one and two.</p>
    <p>We now close sev­eral hours ear­lier be­cause we don’t see crowds like be­fore... We used to have groups of mi­grant work­ers come in to eat. It was good busi­ness, but be­cause the work­ers have been cooped up in the dorms, we’ve lost that cus­tomer base for now.’’</p>
    <p>MADAM TONG, who runs a por­ridge stall in Gey­lang.</p>
    <p>“We thought foot­fall would in­crease but our cus­tomers are mainly mi­grant work­ers from China and many of them don’t come by any more,” said Mr Chris Tan, in his 30s, who runs a mo­bile phone shop at Peo­ple’s Park Com­plex.</p>
    <p>A for­mer busi­ness owner in his 60s, who wanted to be known only as Mr Wong, told ST he had closed his pro­vi­sion shop in Chi­na­town af­ter a decade there be­cause it was “too hard to sur­vive”.</p>
    <p>“You can’t do busi­ness when there’s no one com­ing to buy any­thing. Ev­ery day, you bleed money,” said Mr Wong, who said many of his cus­tomers were from dif­fer­ent parts of China who came for cheap sun­dries and house­hold prod­ucts he im­ported di­rectly from China.</p>
    <p>Prop­erty agent Vic­tor Han told ST he had seen an “un­prece­dented” five units in Chi­na­town be­ing va­cated in the last month alone.</p>
    <p>“It’s a dif­fi­cult sit­u­a­tion. I’m not sure I can find ten­ants fast be­cause even with land­lords be­ing able to</p>
    <p>ac­cept slightly lower rents, it’s not like peo­ple are lin­ing up to set up phys­i­cal shops dur­ing a pan­demic,” Mr Han said.</p>
    <p>A check by ST in Lit­tle In­dia found that work­ers are still stay­ing away even if they have been cleared of the virus. The pop­u­lar Mustafa Cen­tre was close to empty on a week­day night, while gro­cery stores and food out­lets had only one to two cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>On Aug 27, Mustafa told its work­ers it was not re­new­ing the con­tracts of some for­eign staff, who would be sent home with a plane ticket and one month’s salary.</p>
    <p>“All this pro­duce might end up rot­ting if it’s un­sold,” said Mr Raju Ravichan­dran, 31, who runs a store sell­ing fruit and veg­eta­bles.</p>
    <p>He said his stall was once well-pa­tro­n­ised by mi­grant work­ers, but busi­ness had not bounced back to pre-Covid-19 lev­els. He now counts him­self “lucky” if he gets 10 cus­tomers a day.</p>
    <p>“I’m not sure how long we can stay open if the crowds don’t come back.”</p>
    <p>ST also spoke to hawk­ers and op­er­a­tors of food out­lets near Gey­lang where mi­grant work­ers used to go for good, cheap food.</p>
    <p>“We now close sev­eral hours ear­lier be­cause we don’t see the crowds that we used to,” said a por­ridge stall owner in Gey­lang, who gave her name only as Madam Tong, 68. “We used to have groups of mi­grant work­ers come in to eat.</p>
    <p>It was good busi­ness, but be­cause they have been cooped up in the dor­mi­to­ries, we’ve lost that cus­tomer base for now.”</p>
    <p>But the losses in the central ar­eas have been the gain of small busi­nesses pro­vid­ing sim­i­lar es­sen­tial ser­vices in heart­land ar­eas close to dor­mi­to­ries for mi­grant work­ers. These re­ported a wel­come uptick in busi­ness with work­ers choos­ing to shop nearer the dorms.</p>
    <p>Staff at pro­vi­sion shops, food out­lets and SIM card shops near dor­mi­to­ries in Kaki Bukit, Tai Seng, Bukit Ba­tok and Jurong East told ST that since an­nounce­ments last month that mi­grant work­ers would be al­lowed to leave dorms to run er­rands, busi­ness had picked up.</p>
    <p>“Some of the work­ers told me that they would rather go to a store near their dor­mi­to­ries than go all the way to Mustafa Cen­tre or Chi­na­town, since the prices are com­pa­ra­ble and they can find the spices they need at my shop,” said</p>
    <p>Mr Ramesh Singh, in his 50s, who runs a pro­vi­sion shop in Jurong West. He said his shop has seen a 20 per cent in­crease in sales to for­eign work­ers, par­tic­u­larly from Bangladesh.</p>
    <p>“If I can cater to them and keep my busi­ness go­ing, it’s a win-win.”</p>
    <p>Mi­grant worker Xu Yu­jie, 35, from Guangxi in south­ern China, told ST he is now pa­tro­n­is­ing a money re­mit­tance ser­vice in the Jurong area and buy­ing sun­dries from neigh­bour­hood pro­vi­sion stores near his dor­mi­tory, in­stead of go­ing to Chi­na­town.</p>
    <p>“Even though we can now leave the dor­mi­to­ries for per­sonal er­rands, I am very afraid of ex­pos­ing my­self to the virus,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The main rea­son for go­ing to Chi­na­town was to so­cialise and spend time with friends over a meal, but it will be a long time be­fore we can do that again.”</p>
