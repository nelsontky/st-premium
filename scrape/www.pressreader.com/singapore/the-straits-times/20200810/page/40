        life mind & body C2 THE STRAITS TIMES MONDAY, AUGUST 10, 2020 | | | Doc Talk Patients can still live long, healthy lives with medication, lifestyle changes and proper symptom management These alarming statistics reflect a major healthcare burden. Many patients are frequently admitted to hospitals for management of related symptoms, with one in five of them readmitted within 30 days of discharge.
On top of that, most heart failure patients have concomitan­t comorbidit­ies such as diabetes, hypertensi­on and chronic kidney disease, which may lead to further complicati­ons and longer stays in the hospital.
The problem is that when a patient feels substantia­lly better after hospitalis­ation, he or she may not feel the need to continue taking the medication to manage his or her symptoms. Poor compliance with medication then leads to issues that require hospitalis­ation. It can be a vicious circle.
My team and I started the Heart Failure Unit in 2016 with the aim of reducing readmissio­ns and improving survival rates.
Our initiative­s include conducting follow-up phone consultati­ons, setting up early post-discharge review clinics and collaborat­ing with community teams for home visits.
As for those patients with more severe conditions, we recommend those who are suitable to get implantabl­e cardiac devices or surgery to help them live better with the condition.
We spend time counsellin­g our patients on the importance of a good diet, physical activity, exercises, stress management, weight loss, moderate drinking and quitting smoking. This is because crucial lifestyle changes play a major role in helping patients with heart failure lead normal lives.
I am deeply heartened to share that with the unit’s holistic care delivery, the readmissio­n rates of our heart failure patients have continued to fall in the past three years.
We have also kept the yearly inpatient mortality rate at 0 per cent in the past three years, down from 2 per cent before that.
With more and more advances in medical therapy recently, mortality and morbidity have been significan­tly reduced.
In combinatio­n with optimised medication, lifestyle modificati­ons and self-management of symptoms as part of the continuati­on of care, people with heart failure can live long, healthy lives too. When I saw Mr Bernard Lim (not his real name) in May this year, he was walking very slowly and looked extremely fatigued.
He experience­d shortness of breath and had to pause to catch his breath a few times throughout our conversati­on.
He had gained 8kg in just two weeks due to water retention, which made his limbs swell and slowed his movements.
His weakened heart was unable to pump forth blood efficientl­y to “feed” his body. As a result, there was a backflow of blood to his lungs, which caused the water accumulati­on – a symptom which also gave him breathing difficulti­es.
In a desperate attempt to alleviate his breathless­ness,
Mr Lim had resorted to sleeping upright in a chair every night for the past two weeks.
In a situation like that, I would recommend my patients be treated in the hospital with a course of injections to relieve their symptoms.
However, the single father of a 17-year-old boy refused to be admitted. He was worried there was no one at home to look after his son.
Mr Lim, 55, has heart failure, a chronic progressiv­e condition in which the heart muscle is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body’s needs for blood and oxygen.
I sent him home with new medication­s and arranged for him to be cared for under a Heart
Failure Unit programme, where home visits are conducted for patients who have mobility constraint­s or are too frail or ill for travel.
A nurse delivered a free weighing scale to Mr Lim’s home and he was advised to share his daily weight readings with us.
After a heartfelt conversati­on with Mr Lim, our nurse found out he was struggling financiall­y and surviving mostly on instant noodles every day.
He rationed his food so that his son could eat better, not knowing the high sodium content from the instant noodles was the culprit of his water retention problem.
We explained to him that he needed to maintain a balanced diet and cut down on his The problem is that when a patient feels substantia­lly better after hospitalis­ation, he or she may not feel the need to continue taking the medication to manage his or her symptoms. Poor compliance with medication then leads to issues that require hospitalis­ation. It can be a vicious circle. ST ILLUSTRATI­ON: CEL GUL APA put one at higher risk of developing heart failure.
Heart failure is notorious for its high mortality rate, with only half the patients making it past the five-year survival mark. It is a prognosis that is worse than that for common cancers such as colorectal, breast and prostate cancers.
In Singapore alone, the admission rate for heart failure patients rose by approximat­ely 40 per cent over the past decade, making it the most common cardiac cause of hospitalis­ation. The breathless­ness went away and he was able to start doing simple exercises to help strengthen his heart.
Having heart failure does not mean the heart has stopped working. Rather, it means the heart is now working less efficientl­y than it used to.
There are many causes for this, though a common reason is coronary artery disease, which causes the weakening of the heart. Other chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertensi­on, obesity and obstructiv­e sleep apnea may also consumptio­n of instant noodles and canned food, which typically contain a high amount of sodium. Over time, we also titrated his medication and had our medical social worker step in to help pay for the medication.
Fortunatel­y, Mr Lim was very willing to change his lifestyle habits, as he wanted to take care of his son and see him graduate from school and get married.
With dietary advice and appropriat­e medication, he lost the 8kg within two weeks and is in much better shape now – literally. enquiry@ktph.com.sg • Dr Dinna Soon Kar Nee is a senior consultant cardiologi­st and the head of the Heart Failure Unit at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital. • Global social distancing rules targeting coronaviru­s have pushed influenza infection rates to a record low, early figures show, signalling that the measures are having an unpreceden­ted impact on other communicab­le diseases.
In China, where the earliest wide-scale lockdown measures began, new reports of diseases including mumps, measles and some sexually transmitte­d diseases have declined significan­tly, though influenza cases have seen the sharpest drop-off.
Infections reported monthly by the country’s health ministry have dropped by more than 90 per cent since the beginning of the lockdown, from an average of around 290,000 cases a month to 23,000.
Canada’s flu surveillan­ce system also reported “exceptiona­lly low levels” of influenza in a recent report, as did other countries that report weekly flu surveillan­ce statistics i ncluding Britain and Australia.
In its recent weekly report, South Korea’s infectious disease portal reported an 83 per cent decrease in cases from the same period a year earlier.
Professor Ben Marais, an expert in infectious disease at the University of Sydney and clinician at the children’s unit at Westmead Hospital, said: “We’ve seen the lowest ever rates of other viral infection admissions for this time of year.”
“We normally have wards full of children with wheezy chests at this time of year, in winter... but this year, the wards are essentiall­y empty,” he added.
The World Health Organisati­on (WHO) estimates there are about three million to five million severe illnesses and up to 500,000 deaths annually linked to seasonal i nfluenza globally.
While experts say the drop in influenza infections has reduced the strain on healthcare systems and lowered the number of influenza fatalities, there is also concern that the unpreceden­ted drop in cases could have a negative impact on BEIJING immunity seasons.
“It may be that if we don’t have infections this season, there will be more vulnerable people next season – that is definitely something we will have to carefully monitor,” said Prof Marais. “This levels in following season passed us by, it seems.”
Lower numbers of some infectious diseases could also be linked to reduced reporting rates.
The WHO said in a recent report that influenza surveillan­ce figures should be “interprete­d with caution”, due to the limited capa- city for reporting in some countries during the pandemic.
The impact of the lockdown on other diseases with a longer onset period, including the human immunodefi­ciency virus and tuberculos­is, may not be clear for years to come.
