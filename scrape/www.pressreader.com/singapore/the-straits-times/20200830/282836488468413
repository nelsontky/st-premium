    <p>Lit­tle by lit­tle, gram by gram, one choco­late cube by choco­late cube, I have added inches to my tummy.</p>
    <p>All the choco­late bars and boxes I brought back from my Europe hol­i­day for of­fice col­leagues in the hope that Dorscon or­ange would be lifted soon and we would be back at work, in the true sense of the noun, are gone.</p>
    <p>They were fin­ished by me dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>There was not much to stop me you see. Be­ing at home, the re­frig­er­a­tor was more ac­ces­si­ble than the swim­ming pool or my friends. And, I found my­self open­ing it sev­eral times a day for a choco­late square or four.</p>
    <p>The weigh­ing scale was just a cou­ple of feet away but the bat­tery was dead, (still is), and its ac­cus­ing vibes didn’t reach me. As a re­sult, I don’t know how much weight I have gained.</p>
    <p>But when even the lounge wear be­gins to feel a bit tight and un­com­fort­able, the tyres can no longer be ig­nored and the rounder face star­ing back at me on video calls can no longer be blamed on un­flat­ter­ing cam­era an­gles.</p>
    <p>I’m not alone. Pan­demic weight gain or quar­an­tine weight is a thing.</p>
    <p>On the In­ter­net, there is a hash­tag for it: #quar­an­tine15. Ac­cord­ing to Psy­chol­ogy To­day, it refers to a 15-pound (6.8kg) weight gain dur­ing self-iso­la­tion. Some also say they have gained the Covid-19 to re­fer to the ki­los they may have put on.</p>
    <p>Stress eat­ing, lack of ex­er­cise and lone­li­ness are some of the rea­sons given by ne­ti­zens who have put on the pounds dur­ing the pan­demic. De­pres­sion, anx­i­ety and dis­rup­tions to daily rou­tine are also fac­tors that could cause quar­an­tine weight gain, says a med­i­cally re­viewed ar­ti­cle in Amer­i­can web­site Health­line.com.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter user AK re­alised why she was putting on weight. “Was feel­ing sad, then I re­mem­bered I have ice cream in the freezer. My quar­an­tine weight gain is starting to make more sense,” she wrote in a self-re­al­i­sa­tion tweet.</p>
    <p>In a song ti­tled, At The Fridge Again!, gospel singer KD French sings both lead and back­ground vo­cals to ad­mon­ish her­self for want­ing to snack even though she vis­ited the fridge just min­utes ago. “Some­body stop me…,” she starts.</p>
    <p>The gospel singer from At­lanta, Ge­or­gia, has gar­nered nearly 600,000 views for the two-minute video since it was up­loaded on YouTube on Aug 12. “At least mak­ing this song kept me from the fridge for about an hour!!” she wrote in the cap­tion. YouTube user Chick­adee_3155 has called it the of­fi­cial Covid-19 lock­down weight gain an­them.</p>
    <p>But as Twit­ter user jor­dan said, “ok this extra quar­an­tine weight isn’t funny any more”.</p>
    <p>Hu­mour aside, while weight gain and loss are a nor­mal part of life, dur­ing the pan­demic, it could point to the stresses as­so­ci­ated with this pe­riod. Anx­i­ety about jobs and fi­nan­cial se­cu­rity, and ad­di­tional re­spon­si­bil­i­ties at home – in­clud­ing hav­ing to take care of younger and older family mem­bers – all add up.</p>
    <p>Com­fort and emo­tional eat­ing is a way some peo­ple deal with these anx­i­eties, and it is okay not to feel guilty while reach­ing out for that deep-fried chip be­cause your body is crav­ing it due to the wor­ries on your mind.</p>
    <p>But at the same time, some say the ad­di­tional weight and in­take of less nu­tri­tious food can also lead to a weaker im­mune sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“I try to help my pa­tients un­der­stand that it’s not just about the weight,” Dr Mark Hy­man, head of strat­egy and in­no­va­tion at the Cleve­land Clinic Cen­tre for Func­tional Medicine, told ABC News. Through poor nu­tri­tion, “they’re in­creas­ing their risk of com­pli­ca­tions and se­vere in­fec­tion from Covid-19”.</p>
    <p>Just as the In­ter­net has ne­ti­zens shar­ing how they “have gained the Covid-19”, there are some who are also mo­ti­vat­ing oth­ers to keep fit.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter user Car­los Cor­rea lost some of the weight he put on by mak­ing some sim­ple switches.</p>
    <p>“Such a re­lief. I lost 6 of my #quar­an­tine15. All I did was elim­i­nate the sweets (cook­ies and soda mostly) and started drink­ing LOTS more wa­ter, again,” he said.</p>
    <p>Every­one needs space, and I don’t mean the phys­i­cal kind. If you have made the re­frig­er­a­tor or pantry your new best friend, it may be time to gen­tly put some space be­tween the two of you and prac­tise some dis­tanc­ing. It will be dif­fi­cult, I know, to avoid the choco­late aisle on my next trip to the su­per­mar­ket, but I take com­fort in the fact that I am not alone.</p>
    <p>PLAY­ING ON YOUTUBE: LIFE ON A FARM</p>
    <p>Trac­tor tracks, sprawl­ing green fields, wad­dling ducks and frisky calves are what life on a farm is all about. And they are all play­ing on a YouTube chan­nel on your de­vice.</p>
    <p>Farm­ers from across the world are up­load­ing videos about their farms, the food they grow, the an­i­mals they rear and the tech­nol­ogy they use on YouTube, giv­ing rise to a new com­mu­nity of in­flu­encers called the farm-in­flu­encer.</p>
    <p>They in­clude the farmer whose family has been in the in­dus­try for gen­er­a­tions, as well as the first-timer who is learn­ing the tricks of the trade from scratch and also teach­ing fol­low­ers along the way.</p>
    <p>“By us­ing their chan­nels to share their knowl­edge and shed light on ev­ery­thing from the fi­nan­cial as­pects of run­ning a farm to the day-to-day chal­lenges of har­vest sea­son, farm­ing cre­ators are con­fronting stereo­types about their in­dus­try head-on,” says YouTube’s cul­ture and trends team in a blog post ear­lier this month. The team has no­ticed the growing pop­u­lar­ity of the com­mu­nity since last year.</p>
    <p>One of these in­flu­encers is Mered­ith Bernard, whose YouTube chan­nel – This Farm Wife – has 67,600 sub­scribers. It was launched in 2018. “My hus­band, two chil­dren and I work and live on a beef cat­tle op­er­a­tion in Mil­ton, North Carolina, on the Cen­tral North Carolina/Vir­ginia line. No two days are the same around here and I use this vlog to show the good, the bad, the hard and the re­ward­ing we find in this life,” she writes in the cap­tion of her in­tro­duc­tory video.</p>
    <p>Be­sides fol­low­ers, the “Far­mTu­bers” also gain mon­e­tar­ily, with some earn­ing ad­ver­tis­ing rev­enues from prod­uct en­dorse­ments. Some, like North Carolina farmer Justin Rhodes, who was fea­tured in a New York Times ar­ti­cle on farm­ing cre­ators, get a tidy sum in an­nual fees from their fol­low­ers who pay for pri­vate in­struc­tion and in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Per­haps it is a good idea to start talk­ing about the work you do. It may make you the next YouTube star.</p>
