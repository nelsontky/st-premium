    <p>Malaysia’s for­mer prime min­is­ter Na­jib Razak was yes­ter­day found guilty of cor­rup­tion and sen­tenced to 12 years in jail and fined</p>
    <p>RM210 mil­lion (S$68 mil­lion) in the first of five tri­als he faces re­lat­ing to the 1Malaysia Devel­op­ment Ber­had scandal.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s for­mer prime min­is­ter Na­jib Razak was yes­ter­day found guilty of cor­rup­tion and sen­tenced to 12 years in jail and fined RM210 mil­lion (S$68 mil­lion) in the first of five tri­als he faces re­lat­ing to the 1Malaysia Devel­op­ment Ber­had (1MDB) graft scandal.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers said that the ver­dict could se­verely dent Na­jib’s hopes of stag­ing a po­lit­i­cal come­back if a snap elec­tion were to be called soon.</p>
    <p>High Court judge Mohd Na­zlan Mohd Ghaz­ali found Na­jib, 67, guilty of every sin­gle charge, in­clud­ing abuse of power, and mul­ti­ple counts of crim­i­nal breach of trust and money laun­der­ing for il­le­gally re­ceiv­ing RM42 mil­lion from SRC In­ter­na­tional, a for­mer sub­sidiary of 1MDB.</p>
    <p>“I find the ac­cused guilty and con­vict him on all seven charges,” said Jus­tice Mohd Na­zlan.</p>
    <p>The sen­tences ranged between 10 years for each money laun­der­ing and crim­i­nal breach of trust charge and 12 years for abuse of power. Since they will run con­cur­rently, it means Na­jib is re­quired to serve up to a to­tal of 12 years in prison.</p>
    <p>The for­mer prime min­is­ter re­mains free as he was granted a stay of ex­e­cu­tion pend­ing his appeal against the ver­dict.</p>
    <p>He has to post RM1 mil­lion bail to­day and is re­quired to re­port to the po­lice twice a month.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Mohd Na­zlan, in his twohour long judg­ment, dis­missed Na­jib’s claim that the RM42 mil­lion in his bank ac­count was a do­na­tion from the Saudi Ara­bian royal fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Na­jib, who spoke in court dur­ing the mit­i­ga­tion hear­ing, had claimed: “I did not de­mand the RM42 mil­lion, I did not plan for it, it was never of­fered to me... (there is) no ev­i­dence to say so.”</p>
    <p>The judge had ear­lier said: “It is very dif­fi­cult not to char­ac­terise the en­tire Arab do­na­tion nar­ra­tive as self-serv­ing.”</p>
    <p>Na­jib’s l ead de­fence coun­sel Shafee Ab­dul­lah had also claimed the for­mer prime min­is­ter was a “vic­tim of scam” by fugi­tive busi­ness­man Low Taek Jho, which the judge ruled was “far fetched”.</p>
    <p>“All roads lead to Rome. In this case, they lead to Riyadh,” the judge said, in a ref­er­ence to the de­fence’s ar­gu­ments re­gard­ing the Saudi do­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Na­jib had ear­lier ar­rived at the court ac­com­pa­nied by thou­sands of sup­port­ers who thronged the streets, rais­ing con­cerns over so­cial dis­tanc­ing amid the pan­demic. Many were seen cry­ing when news of the ver­dict reached them.</p>
    <p>Na­jib re­tains his par­lia­men­tary seat in Pekan, Pa­hang, pend­ing the appeal, but he will not be able to con­test a gen­eral elec­tion while the guilty ver­dict stands.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin could use Na­jib’s con­vic­tion as an op­por­tu­nity to bol­ster his slim ma­jor­ity by call­ing snap elec­tions, ob­servers said. He is rid­ing high in public opin­ion, hav­ing demon­strated his com­mit­ment to pur­sue graft cases, even against his own al­lies in the Perikatan Na­sional gov­ern­ment, and suc­cess­fully tack­led the coro­n­avirus cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Na­jib faces an­other 35 counts of cor­rup­tion, abuse of power and money laun­der­ing in four other court cases re­lat­ing to his role in the multi­bil­lion-dol­lar scandal in­volv­ing 1MDB, the state fund he co­founded in 2009.</p>
    <p>The charges were in­sti­tuted un­der for­mer rul­ing coali­tion Pakatan Hara­pan, af­ter its shock win against Na­jib’s Umno party in the May 2018 gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Af­ter yes­ter­day’s ver­dict, Tan Sri Muhyid­din asked Malaysians to have faith in the ju­di­cial sys­tem. “I un­der­stand the feel­ings and sen­ti­ments you are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing – but let me stress that the gov­ern­ment will al­ways up­hold the rule of law.”</p>
    <p>The United States au­thor­i­ties claim over US$4.5 bil­lion (S$6.2 bil­lion) was em­bez­zled from 1MDB.</p>
    <p>One thing is for cer­tain now –</p>
    <p>Na­jib Razak will not re­turn as Malaysia’s leader should snap polls ma­te­ri­alise.</p>
    <p>Be­fore his con­vic­tion for graft yes­ter­day, Na­jib was still a dark-horse bet for his old job de­spite lead­ing his Barisan Na­sional coali­tion to a shock</p>
    <p>2018 gen­eral elec­tion de­feat that was partly fu­elled by his role in the bil­lion-dol­lar 1Malaysia Devel­op­ment Ber­had (1MDB) scandal.</p>
    <p>Con­tro­ver­sial re­cent set­tle­ments in the saga that have let Na­jib’s son-in-law and in­vest­ment bank Gold­man Sachs off from pros­e­cu­tion had raised ques­tions over whether Na­jib, who re­mains pop­u­lar and is an in­flu­en­tial ally in the Perikatan Na­sional (PN) gov­ern­ment, would be ac­corded the same treat­ment by Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin.</p>
    <p>In­stead, Tan Sri Muhyid­din can now cap­i­talise on Na­jib’s seven con­vic­tions for graft to se­cure a stronger man­date, by call­ing a fresh elec­tion in the com­ing months, de­spite a bal­lot not be­ing due un­til late 2023.</p>
    <p>Na­jib re­mains the Umno rep­re­sen­ta­tive for Pekan, pend­ing his appeal against the con­vic­tions, but he will not be able to defend the seat if Par­lia­ment is dis­solved be­fore his appeal suc­ceeds.</p>
    <p>With Umno pres­i­dent Zahid Hamidi also fac­ing cor­rup­tion charges of his own, Malaysia’s largest party lacks a cred­i­ble prime min­is­te­rial can­di­date in the short term.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the op­po­si­tion is split between sup­port­ing Tun Dr</p>
    <p>Ma­hathir Mo­hamad and Datuk Seri An­war Ibrahim.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din, how­ever, has every mo­ti­va­tion to seek a per­sonal man­date, hav­ing strug­gled with a slim ma­jor­ity since tak­ing power on March 1, af­ter de­fect­ing from Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) with 40 other MPs and caus­ing the PH gov­ern­ment to col­lapse.</p>
    <p>His loose PN al­liance gov­erns with just 113 MPs in the 222-strong Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that in­ter­nal gov­ern­ment polling shows his per­sonal pop­u­lar­ity rid­ing high over his ad­min­is­tra­tion’s han­dling of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Risk con­sul­tancy Eura­sia Group’s Asia di­rec­tor Peter Mum­ford be­lieves “the ver­dict does not dra­mat­i­cally al­ter the po­lit­i­cal out­look”, with “elec­tions ex­pected rel­a­tively soon”.</p>
    <p>“Muhyid­din will hope the ver­dict shows his gov­ern­ment recog­nises the im­por­tance of good gov­er­nance and rule of law,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Yet, a fresh and stronger man­date for Mr Muhyid­din, 73, and his fledgling Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia does not guar­an­tee their longevity at the top.</p>
    <p>Umno is still ex­pected to have the lion’s share of law­mak­ers in a post-elec­tion PN gov­ern­ment, and will de­mand the premier­ship back if it has an ac­cept­able leader to put for­ward.</p>
    <p>For now, Na­jib, whose fa­ther Ab­dul Razak Hus­sein was Malaysia’s well-re­spected sec­ond prime min­is­ter, will have to bear the ig­nominy of be­ing the coun­try’s first for­mer prime min­is­ter found to have em­bez­zled public funds.</p>
    <p>But the 67-year-old could still make a come­back, said Bower Group Asia’s an­a­lyst Adib Zalka­pli.</p>
    <p>“This is not the end of the world for Na­jib. The fact that he was un­seated by a coali­tion founded by the DAP (Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party) makes him very pop­u­lar with the Malay-Mus­lim com­mu­nity. He is a mar­tyr to them,” he said, re­fer­ring to the Chi­nese-dom­i­nated party that is now the largest in the for­mer PH rul­ing pact.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, yes­ter­day’s de­ci­sion leaves Umno at a cross­roads, five years to the day that then Prime Min­is­ter Na­jib sacked his deputy, Mr Muhyid­din, for crit­i­cis­ing his lead­er­ship over the 1MDB scandal.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion for Malaysia’s grand old party is whether oth­ers will rise to fill the lead­er­ship gap or whether the old guard will fall back in place.</p>
    <p>“Now is the time for Umno to move for­ward... for us to see a gen­er­a­tional shift in lead­er­ship that can bring the party to a new era,” for­mer Umno Youth chief Khairy Ja­malud­din said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In 2018, Mr Khairy had placed sec­ond in the race for the party’s lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>For now, Na­jib, whose fa­ther Ab­dul Razak Hus­sein was Malaysia’s well-re­spected sec­ond prime min­is­ter, will have to bear the ig­nominy of be­ing the coun­try’s first for­mer prime min­is­ter found to have em­bez­zled public funds.</p>
