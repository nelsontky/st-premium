    <p>Sci­en­tist</p>
    <p>When he was seven, As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Andy Tay was al­ready ask­ing ques­tions such as “Why do tigers have stripes?” when he vis­ited the zoo. When his par­ents failed to give him the answers, the cu­ri­ous boy would look them up in en­cy­clopae­dias.</p>
    <p>He is now in the field of can­cer re­search, pur­su­ing answers to chronic health­care prob­lems like can­cer and pain.</p>
    <p>His re­search is mo­ti­vated by his par­ents – his mother is a breast can­cer sur­vivor, while his fa­ther, who used to work as a con­struc­tion worker and is now a taxi driver, suf­fers from lower back pain.</p>
    <p>Hop­ing to cre­ate a real-world im­pact and one day help his loved ones and many other fam­i­lies, Prof Tay fo­cuses on de­vel­op­ing nano­ma­te­ri­als to en­gi­neer im­mune cells for treat­ing can­cer.</p>
    <p>An as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, he was the only Sin­ga­porean se­lected in the Class of 2020 World Eco­nomic Fo­rum Young Sci­en­tists for his cut­ting-edge re­search.</p>
    <p>CHEN CHEE YANG, 29 Founder of Carta Ge­nomics</p>
    <p>Born as an in-vitro fer­til­i­sa­tion (IVF) baby 29 years ago, en­tre­pre­neur Chen Chee Yang is now help­ing par­ents who go for IVF make one of their tough­est de­ci­sions: which em­bryos to im­plant. Dr Chen founded Carta Ge­nomics in 2018 to pro­vide clin­i­cal-grade ge­nomics test­ing to pro­duce health­ier IVF ba­bies.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ing ma­chine learn­ing, he is able to pre­dict the risk of an em­bryo de­vel­op­ing dis­eases like breast can­cer and Alzheimer’s later in life, based on the in­ter­ac­tions be­tween mul­ti­ple genes and the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>A qual­i­fied doc­tor and neu­ro­science grad­u­ate from Im­pe­rial Col­lege Lon­don, he prac­tised medicine in Britain be­fore re­turn­ing to Sin­ga­pore to build his com­pany. The firm has part­nered top IVF clin­ics world­wide and is ex­pand­ing its Sin­ga­pore team, with the goal of bring­ing ge­netic test­ing to more Asians.</p>
    <p>LAVENNIAH ANNADORAY, 29 PhD stu­dent</p>
    <p>De­ter­mined to trans­late sci­ence from bench to bed­side, Ms Lavenniah Annadoray set out to de­sign a drug that can be ad­min­is­tered with ease, given how most peo­ple strug­gle to stick to daily med­i­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>She went into re­search in en­gi­neer­ing DNA and ri­bonu­cleic acid (RNA) – both ge­netic se­quences – to treat dis­eases. This led to the de­vel­op­ment of a new cir­cu­lar mi­croRNA in­ter­fer­ence tech­nol­ogy plat­form, which gen­er­ates med­i­ca­tions tar­get­ing the small RNA (or mi­croRNA) that drives disease pro­gres­sion. The drugs are more sta­ble and hence al­low for longer dos­ing in­ter­vals.</p>
    <p>Last month, Ms Annadoray be­came a re­cip­i­ent of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Medicine Kick­start Ini­tia­tive grant, which will sup­port the com­mer­cial­i­sa­tion of the plat­form through a spinoff com­pany that will be launched in Britain and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>PETER YEOW, 29 Re­searcher</p>
    <p>Mr Peter Yeow’s colour blind­ness may have got in the way of his dreams of be­ing a doc­tor, but it was not a road­block in his path in bi­ol­ogy.</p>
    <p>He de­cided to pur­sue a ca­reer in can­cer re­search as an­other way to save lives and fur­ther his in­ter­est in the sub­ject.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently pur­su­ing a PhD in clin­i­cal medicine at Ox­ford Univer­sity un­der a schol­ar­ship with the Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search, he made a ground-break­ing dis­cov­ery in iden­ti­fy­ing a novel way to se­lec­tively kill ag­gres­sive breast can­cer cells that have a spe­cific ge­netic fault, while leav­ing nor­mal cells un­harmed.</p>
    <p>What is even more promis­ing is that this ge­netic mark is also found in many other can­cer types.</p>
    <p>This re­sult was so sig­nif­i­cant that the study was pub­lished in the jour­nal Na­ture. Mr Yeow is one of the lead au­thors of the pa­per.</p>
