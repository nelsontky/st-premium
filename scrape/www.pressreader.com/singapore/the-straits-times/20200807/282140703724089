    <p>Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries (Sem­b­corp) and Sem­b­corp Ma­rine (Sem­bMarine) are call­ing on their share­hold­ers to vote in favour of a pro­posed $2.1 bil­lion re­cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion for the off­shore and ma­rine en­gi­neer­ing group, as well as a de­merger from each other that will re­sult in Te­masek hav­ing a di­rect stake in the ma­rine arm.</p>
    <p>In a reg­u­la­tory fil­ing yes­ter­day, both com­pa­nies asked their re­spec­tive share­hold­ers to sub­mit their proxy forms to vote in favour of the res­o­lu­tions tabled at ex­tra­or­di­nary gen­eral meet­ings (EGMs) in or­der for the trans­ac­tion to pro­ceed.</p>
    <p>At the up­com­ing EGMs on Aug 11, share­hold­ers will vote on three res­o­lu­tions: Sem­b­corp’s move to dis­trib­ute its Sem­bMarine shares in specie; Sem­bMarine’s un­der­tak­ing of the rights is­sue; and a white­wash res­o­lu­tion that will waive in­vestors’ rights to re­ceive a manda­tory takeover of­fer from Sin­ga­pore in­vest­ment com­pany Te­masek.</p>
    <p>All three res­o­lu­tions re­quire a sim­ple ma­jor­ity, but are in­ter-con­di­tional.</p>
    <p>Sem­bMarine said the rights is­sue will pro­vide the com­pany with the “much-needed re­cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion” to ride out the in­dus­try down­turn, strengthen its bal­ance sheet and re­po­si­tion the com­pany for its long-term vi­a­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>It also warned that share­hold­ers who opt not to take up their rights en­ti­tle­ment will see their share­hold­ings di­luted af­ter the rights is­sue.</p>
    <p>Sem­bMarine said: “If share­hold­ers do not ap­prove the trans­ac­tion, Sem­bMarine’s stren­u­ous ef­forts to re­cap­i­talise and strengthen its bal­ance sheet will be negated and the crit­i­cal need to ad­dress our liq­uid­ity re­quire­ments will fail.”</p>
    <p>It added that only a few of its bank fa­cil­i­ties will be af­fected by a change in con­trol. The banks be­hind the fa­cil­i­ties col­lec­tively ac­count for some $6.03 bil­lion of loan and trade fa­cil­i­ties that have been ex­tended to Sem­bMarine thus far.</p>
    <p>Sem­bMarine noted that these banks are sup­port­ive of the trans­ac­tion and have in­di­cated the con­tin­u­a­tion of bank fa­cil­i­ties to be ex­tended to the com­pany.</p>
    <p>It said that with the pro­posed re­cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion, it ex­pects the banks to re­fi­nance ex­ist­ing bor­row­ings and pro­vide ad­di­tional fa­cil­i­ties. But should the trans­ac­tion fall through, the banks are ex­pected to re­fi­nance ex­ist­ing bor­row­ings with­out pro­vid­ing ad­di­tional fi­nanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Sem­bMarine also ad­dressed mar­ket chat­ter on a po­ten­tial merger with in­dus­try con­glom­er­ate Kep­pel or a pri­vati­sa­tion move, say­ing it was not aware of any such pro­pos­als.</p>
    <p>Al­though Sem­b­corp has not been bogged down by fi­nan­cial losses, it re­mains fo­cused on un­lock­ing value for share­hold­ers through this trans­ac­tion. It said the de­merger would trans­form the com­pany into a “fo­cused en­ergy and ur­ban busi­ness” and al­low it to al­lo­cate cap­i­tal and re­sources solely to these ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Both Sem­b­corp and Sem­bMarine said they were un­able to com­ment on the share price of the com­pa­nies af­ter the trans­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Both are set to con­vene their vir­tual EGMs next Tues­day. The Sem­bMarine meet­ing will be held at 10am, while the Sem­b­corp meet­ing will take place at 11.30am.</p>
    <p>Share­hold­ers may par­tic­i­pate in the EGMs by ob­serv­ing and/or lis­ten­ing to the pro­ceed­ings via live au­dio-vis­ual we­b­cast or livestream (au­dio only), and by sub­mit­ting ques­tions in advance. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, share­hold­ers will not be al­lowed to at­tend the EGMs in per­son.</p>
    <p>Sem­bMarine share­hold­ers who wish to reg­is­ter for the EGM and sub­mit ques­tions or proxy forms must do so by 10am to­mor­row, while the dead­line for Sem­b­corp share­hold­ers is 11.30am to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Sem­b­corp shares closed up one cent, or 0.6 per cent, at $1.84 yes­ter­day, while Sem­bMarine shares fell one cent, or 2.6 per cent, to 37.5 cents.</p>
    <p>If share­hold­ers do not ap­prove the trans­ac­tion, Sem­bMarine’s stren­u­ous ef­forts to re­cap­i­talise and strengthen its bal­ance sheet will be negated and the crit­i­cal need to ad­dress our liq­uid­ity ’’ re­quire­ments will fail. SEM­BMARINE</p>
