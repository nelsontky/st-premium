    <p>LON­DON • Aston Villa, Wat­ford and Bournemout­h were all play­ing away yes­ter­day on the final day of the coronaviru­s-hit Premier League, but only Villa re­turned home know­ing they will still be in the top flight in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Af­ter 352 days since the ball was first kicked this term, both Bournemout­h and Wat­ford put in huge last-ditch ef­forts to sal­vage their sea­sons, but could not avoid rel­e­ga­tion along­side Nor­wich.</p>
    <p>Ed­die Howe’s Cher­ries went against the odds to beat Ever­ton 3-1 at Good­i­son Park, tak­ing the lead from a Joshua King penalty as early as the 14th minute.</p>
    <p>Moise Kean then net­ted for the Tof­fees in the 42nd minute, but Ever­ton’s equaliser did not last long as Bournemout­h re­took the lead in first-half stop­page time through Do­minic Solanke’s thun­der­ous header from a free kick. Ju­nior Stanis­las rounded off Bournemout­h’s win 10 min­utes from the final whis­tle.</p>
    <p>Wat­ford also could not es­cape the drop as they fell 3-2 at Arse­nal.</p>
    <p>The Hor­nets did not give up af­ter go­ing three goals down within 33 min­utes, with Pierre-Em­er­ick Aubameyang scor­ing a brace and Kieran Tier­ney net­ting for the Gun­ners.</p>
    <p>Wat­ford replied through Troy Deeney, from the spot in the 42nd minute, and Danny Wel­beck af­ter the break.</p>
    <p>De­spite both teams’ ef­forts, the re­sults meant that Bournemout­h fin­ished the sea­son in 18th place on 34 points, ahead of 19th-placed Wat­ford on goal dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>The Cher­ries and the Hor­nets will be play­ing in the sec­ond-tier Cham­pi­onship next cam­paign, af­ter both spend­ing the past five sea­sons in the Premier League.</p>
    <p>For Villa, a point from their 1-1 draw at West Ham was enough as they re­mained in 17th spot and above the drop zone on 35 points.</p>
    <p>Villa skip­per Jack Gre­al­ish scored for his side in the 84th minute, be­fore An­driy Yar­molenko equalised just two min­utes later.</p>
    <p>Dean Smith’s men turned their sea­son around fol­low­ing a run of six games with­out a vic­tory af­ter the league’s hia­tus.</p>
    <p>Wins over Crys­tal Palace (2-0) and Arse­nal (1-0) and a 1-1 draw with Ever­ton be­fore yes­ter­day res­cued their sea­son.</p>
    <p>The three rel­e­gated teams will give way to Leeds and West Brom, both who have won au­to­matic pro­mo­tion to the Premier League, with one of ei­ther Brentford, Ful­ham, Cardiff or Swansea to join them fol­low­ing their play-off semi-final clashes and the final on Aug 4.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Manch&#xAD;ester United&#x2019;s Bruno Fer&#xAD;nan&#xAD;des go&#xAD;ing down from a chal&#xAD;lenge by Le&#xAD;ices&#xAD;ter de&#xAD;fender James Justin. The Por&#xAD;tuguese mid&#xAD;fielder, a Jan&#xAD;uary re&#xAD;cruit, put his stamp on United&#x2019;s league sea&#xAD;son with the open&#xAD;ing goal from the penalty spot that set his side on the way to a 2-0 win and a third-place fin&#xAD;ish that en&#xAD;sures qual&#xAD;i&#xAD;fi&#xAD;ca&#xAD;tion for next sea&#xAD;son&#x2019;s Cham&#xAD;pi&#xAD;ons League.</p>
