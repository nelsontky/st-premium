    <p>A ro­bot that car­ries out nasal swab­bing to di­ag­nose Covid-19 has been de­vel­oped by clin­i­cians who say the au­to­mated pro­ce­dure is safer, faster and more com­fort­able com­pared with man­ual swab tests.</p>
    <p>The clin­i­cians said the ro­bot, called SwabBot, is the first in the world that al­lows pa­tients to fully con­trol the swab process.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients can ac­ti­vate and ter­mi­nate the test at will.</p>
    <p>A pa­tient sits in front of the ro­bot, sim­i­lar to how he would take a mech­a­nised eye ex­am­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Af­ter he ac­ti­vates the ro­bot, the swab will ex­tend from the ma­chine and into his nose to the back of the nasal cav­ity, which is typ­i­cally about 10cm from the nos­trils. The process takes 20 sec­onds, which is faster than a man­ual swab test.</p>
    <p>The ma­chine was de­vel­oped by clin­i­cians from the Na­tional Can­cer Cen­tre Sin­ga­pore, Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hospi­tal (SGH) and Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School, in part­ner­ship with medtech com­pany Biobot Sur­gi­cal.</p>
    <p>The team said the ro­bot can ad­dress the lim­i­ta­tions and risks of man­ual swab­bing. These in­clude re­duc­ing swab­bers’ risk of ex­po­sure and the need for train­ing peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The clin­i­cians also wanted to make the swab­bing pro­ce­dure more com­fort­able for pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Al­though some find a typ­i­cal swab test very un­com­fort­able, it is gen­er­ally pain­less. There may be some de­gree of dis­com­fort or tick­lish­ness, and pa­tients may feel like sneez­ing or cough­ing dur­ing the process. Some pa­tients may tear up as well.</p>
    <p>To date, a to­tal of 85 pa­tients from SGH and Bright Vi­sion Hospi­tal as well as vol­un­teers have par­tic­i­pated in the on­go­ing clin­i­cal trial that com­pares SwabBot against man­ual swab­bing.</p>
    <p>All the par­tic­i­pants said the pro­ce­dure with the ro­bot was ei­ther equally or less painful com­pared with get­ting a man­ual swab.</p>
    <p>A ro­bot that car­ries out nasal swab­bing to di­ag­nose Covid-19 has been de­vel­oped by clin­i­cians who say the au­to­mated pro­ce­dure is safer, faster and more com­fort­able com­pared with man­ual swab tests.</p>
    <p>Al­though other coun­tries have de­vel­oped sim­i­lar ro­bots, the clin­i­cians said this bot, called SwabBot, is the first that al­lows pa­tients to fully con­trol the swab process so they are more com­fort­able.</p>
    <p>A pa­tient sits in front of the ro­bot while hold­ing on to the hand­hold, and latches his nos­tril onto the dis­pos­able nose­piece.</p>
    <p>Af­ter us­ing his chin to push a but­ton and ac­ti­vate the bot, the nose­piece moves slightly up­wards to widen the nos­tril. The swab will ex­tend and ro­tate safely and gently through the pa­tient’s nose to the back of the nasal cav­ity.</p>
    <p>SwabBot has a built-in fea­ture that with­draws the swab stick if there is re­sis­tance when it is moved deeper into the nasal cav­ity. If pa­tients feel un­com­fort­able at any point, they can stop the process by mov­ing their head away from the ro­bot.</p>
    <p>The process takes 20 sec­onds, while a man­ual swab test can take twice as long. At the end of the pro­ce­dure, a med­i­cal worker will open the ma­chine to re­move and store the swab stick.</p>
    <p>The ro­bot, in­clud­ing its in­te­rior, will be wiped down and cov­ered with a fresh plas­tic drape fit­ted with a nose­piece for the next pa­tient.</p>
    <p>The ma­chine, which is 35cm by 40cm, and 49cm high, was de­vel­oped by clin­i­cians from the Na­tional Can­cer Cen­tre Sin­ga­pore (NCCS), Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hospi­tal (SGH) and Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School, in col­lab­o­ra­tion with med­i­cal robotics com­pany Biobot Sur­gi­cal.</p>
    <p>The team said the ro­bot can ad­dress the lim­i­ta­tions and risks of man­ual swab­bing. It re­duces swab­bers’ risk of ex­po­sure to the virus and the need for train­ing peo­ple, stan­dard­ises the con­sis­tency of swabs taken, and in­creases the ef­fi­ciency of con­duct­ing swab tests.</p>
    <p>“Our team felt that we had to find a bet­ter way to swab pa­tients to re­duce the risk of ex­po­sure of Covid-19 to our health­care work­ers, es­pe­cially when pa­tients sneeze or cough dur­ing the swab­bing process,” said prin­ci­pal in­ves­ti­ga­tor Rena Dhar­mawan, as­so­ciate con­sul­tant, head and neck surgery, at NCCS and SGH’s Di­vi­sion of Surgery and Sur­gi­cal On­col­ogy.</p>
    <p>Beyond that, the clin­i­cians wanted to make the swab­bing pro­ce­dure more com­fort­able for pa­tients.</p>
    <p>SwabBot re­tains the same gentle touch and pre­ci­sion as sur­geons who per­form very del­i­cate pro­ce­dures, said Dr Luke Tay, con­sul­tant</p>
    <p>at SGH’s De­part­ment of Vas­cu­lar Surgery, who is one of the project’s team mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Dr Dhar­mawan said: “When pa­tients are em­pow­ered and fully in con­trol of the swab­bing process, they are men­tally pre­pared and ex­pe­ri­ence sub­jec­tively less pain.”</p>
    <p>To date, a to­tal of 85 pa­tients from SGH and Bright Vi­sion Hospi­tal as well as vol­un­teers have par­tic­i­pated in the on­go­ing clin­i­cal trial that com­pares SwabBot against man­ual swab­bing. All of the par­tic­i­pants said the pro­ce­dure with the ro­bot was ei­ther equally or less painful com­pared with get­ting a man­ual swab, said Dr Dhar­mawan.</p>
    <p>Vol­un­teer Marco Lizwan, 25, a sec­ond-year med­i­cal stu­dent at Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School, said he was less wor­ried when he was swabbed by the ro­bot.</p>
    <p>“I found the ro­bot more com­fort­able be­cause you can (turn it on) when­ever you are ready. So things are within your con­trol. I was wor­ried when I did the man­ual one be­cause I was won­der­ing if the swab­ber’s hand will be shaky.”</p>
    <p>SingHealth and Biobot Sur­gi­cal have filed a patent for SwabBot’s tech­nol­ogy. Biobot is also work­ing to get the ro­bot CE-marked for it to be com­mer­cialised glob­ally.</p>
    <p>Two months ago, a Tai­wanese medtech firm de­vel­oped a ro­botic arm that can con­duct nasal swabs by us­ing a depth-sens­ing cam­era. A start-up in Den­mark also re­cently in­vented a fully au­to­mated throat swab ro­bot.</p>
