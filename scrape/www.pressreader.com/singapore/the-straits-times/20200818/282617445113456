    <p>In the wake of an ex­cru­ci­at­ing and pub­lic di­vorce fi­nalised in Jan­uary this year, Aus­tralian ac­tor Liam Hemsworth (left) has de­vel­oped less than pos­i­tive feel­ings to­wards his exwife, singer Mi­ley Cyrus (left, be­low).</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a re­port by en­ter­tain­ment mag­a­zine Us Weekly, the 30-year-old ac­tor, known for films such as The Hunger Games film se­ries (2012 to 2015), has a “low opin­ion” of Cyrus, 27.</p>
    <p>The source adds that the ac­tor was “re­ally hurt by their split”.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple were mar­ried be­tween De­cem­ber 2018 and Au­gust last year. The di­vorce fil­ing marked the end of a 10-year re­la­tion­ship, which be­gan on the set of ro­mance film, The Last Song (2010).</p>
    <p>The source adds that the two are not on talk­ing terms, adding that “Liam was hurt by Mi­ley mov­ing on with new love in­ter­ests shortly af­ter they broke up”.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust last year, the same month that Hemsworth and Cyrus filed for di­vorce, Cyrus was seen kiss­ing 31-year-old blog­ger Kait­lynn Carter.</p>
    <p>The singer be­gan dat­ing Cody</p>
    <p>Simpson two months later. The two called it quits this month, af­ter 10 months of dat­ing.</p>
    <p>Hemsworth has, in turn, been see­ing 24-year-old Aus­tralian model Gabriella Brooks for sev­eral months.</p>
    <p>The source says: “Liam has been try­ing to be as pri­vate as pos­si­ble and re­spect­ful about (his and Mi­ley’s) re­la­tion­ship and break-up, and it’s a shame to him and his fam­ily that cer­tain as­pects about his and Mi­ley’s re­la­tion­ship have been made pub­lic. He’s a very tra­di­tional and good guy and was very hurt by the way spe­cific in­stances played out in front of the world.”</p>
    <p>Hemsworth, in a ques­tion-andan­swer sec­tion in Men’s Health mag­a­zine in April this year, spoke about the me­dia cir­cus fol­low­ing the break-up, say­ing that the en­su­ing me­dia scru­tiny “re­ally got to me”.</p>
    <p>Cyrus also re­flected on the split in an in­ter­view last Fri­day. Speak­ing on sports and pop cul­ture blog Barstool Sports’ Call Her Daddy pod­cast, she said: “I had a very pub­lic, very big break-up that was over a 10-year span of a re­la­tion­ship... It’s like a death when you lose a love that deep. It feels like a death”.</p>
