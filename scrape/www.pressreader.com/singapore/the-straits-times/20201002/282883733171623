    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Your drive for suc­cess is a po­tent force. You should be able to make real progress along your ca­reer path or with a ro­man­tic prospect.</p>
    <p>Tau­rus</p>
    <p>(April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>You feel rushed and you dis­like it.</p>
    <p>It is one of those days when things are not go­ing your way and you have to push back to hold your ground.</p>
    <p>Gem­ini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Your de­sires are com­ing closer to the sur­face. Whether it is a new job or a new love you are eye­ing, your clar­ity helps you to get there soon.</p>
    <p>Cancer</p>
    <p>(June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>You may feel as if you have had an ex­tra shot of espresso, even be­fore you get out of bed.</p>
    <p>Your mind is work­ing over­time.</p>
    <p>Leo</p>
    <p>(July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Some­one new passes through your life; maybe he or she will stay. Learn as much as you can from him or her, as he or she has deep wis­dom.</p>
    <p>Virgo</p>
    <p>(Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>You are stir­ring up trou­ble wher­ever you go. Most of it is harm­less, but at least one per­son may take you far too se­ri­ously.</p>
    <p>Li­bra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>You need to deal with some­one who is on the edge of some­thing dif­fi­cult or weird. You need to di­rect him or her to the right place.</p>
    <p>Scor­pio</p>
    <p>(Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>It is a great day to start some­thing new. It could be a re­la­tion­ship, a job, an art project or just a good habit you want to in­stil in your­self.</p>
    <p>Sagit­tar­ius (Nov 22 - Dec 21) Putting on a brave face against nearly im­pos­si­ble odds should in­spire at least one per­son to ad­just his or her at­ti­tude.</p>
    <p>Capri­corn</p>
    <p>(Dec 22 - Jan 19) Some­thing is hold­ing you back. Your fam­ily may have needs that are con­flict­ing with that of your boss or clients, so try to strike a bal­ance.</p>
    <p>Aquar­ius</p>
    <p>(Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>You are amazed at what you see. It could be as sim­ple as some­thing a child shows you or a game-changer. Run with it as far as you can.</p>
    <p>Pisces</p>
    <p>(Feb 19 - March 20) Some­thing you be­lieved in turns out to be il­lu­sory, but it is not all bad news. Now that you know what is what, you can move on more eas­ily.</p>
