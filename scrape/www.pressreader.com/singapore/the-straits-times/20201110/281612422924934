    <p>Club­bing and karaoke un­der the Gov­ern­ment’s pro­posed nightlife pi­lot pro­gramme will be open only to lo­cal res­i­dents and those with work passes, who must show proof of a Covid-19 test taken in the 24 hours be­fore they can en­ter a joint.</p>
    <p>Clubs that are part of the pi­lot will have a ca­pac­ity limit of 100 peo­ple in two sep­a­rate zones of 50 peo­ple each. Along with mask­ing up on the dance floor, cus­tomers will have to stay 2m apart from other groups, in­di­cated by floor mark­ings and bar­ri­ers. No live en­ter­tain­ment will be al­lowed.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, karaoke es­tab­lish­ments can have groups of up to five peo­ple in en­closed rooms that will have to be dis­in­fected and aired for 15 min­utes be­tween groups. Eat­ing and drink­ing will be al­lowed within the rooms.</p>
    <p>In both types of venues, no host will be al­lowed to in­ter­act with cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed safe man­age­ment mea­sures for pa­tro­n­is­ing night­clubs and karaoke joints, as well as the con­di­tions for busi­nesses to pivot and exit the in­dus­try, were among de­tails shared by the Sin­ga­pore Nightlife Busi­ness As­so­ci­a­tion (SNBA) in a press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Last week, the Gov­ern­ment said up to 25 es­tab­lish­ments can par­tic­i­pate in a two- to three-month pi­lot for en­ter­tain­ment venues to re­open here, with strict safe man­age­ment mea­sures in place.</p>
    <p>The pi­lot for pubs and bars is ex­pected to kick off next month, and next Jan­uary for karaoke es­tab­lish­ments and night­clubs. Un­der the pi­lot, pubs and bars will be sub­ject to the same rules as restau­rants, and their cus­tomers will not be re­quired to un­dergo pre-en­try Covid-19 test­ing.</p>
    <p>SNBA said it has re­ceived around 60 queries since last Fri­day from busi­nesses want­ing to par­tic­i­pate in the pi­lot pro­gramme. While there has been much “in­ter­est and ex­cite­ment” in the pi­lot, SNBA pres­i­dent Joseph Ong cau­tioned that par­tic­i­pa­tion will be “oner­ous”, given the strict rules.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong likened it to a “phase one clin­i­cal trial, where the sam­ples are very small, and the ob­ser­va­tion pe­riod rather long, with pos­si­ble changes in the test pa­ram­e­ters along the way”.</p>
    <p>“The chances are low that they will be se­lected, and the trial re­quires ex­treme plan­ning and care,” he said.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal de­ci­sion on which es­tab­lish­ments will be se­lected for the pi­lot will be made jointly by the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try and the Min­istry of Home Af­fairs.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses that are part of the pi­lot will have to bear the costs of Covid-19 tests for pa­trons, which the as­so­ci­a­tion es­ti­mates to be be</p>
    <p>tween $30 and $100 per test.</p>
    <p>“We are hop­ing that who­ever comes to us with pro­pos­als for the pi­lot takes into ac­count that cus­tomers are likely go­ing to have to ab­sorb the cost of the tests,” said Mr Ong.</p>
    <p>SNBA said it will look into part­ner­ing clin­ics that do test­ing, in hopes of re­duc­ing costs.</p>
    <p>Along with an in­dus­try brief­ing on avail­able op­tions for busi­ness own­ers, SNBA said it will re­lease an on­line form to­mor­row for nightlife busi­nesses in­ter­ested in join­ing the pi­lot. Ap­pli­ca­tions for karaoke es­tab­lish­ments will be han­dled by the Sin­ga­pore En­ter­tain­ment Af­fil­i­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment an­nounced last week that nightlife es­tab­lish­ments which are not par­tic­i­pat­ing in the pi­lots can ap­ply for fi­nan­cial sup­port pack­ages to ei­ther pivot to food and bev­er­age (F&B) op­er­a­tions or other commercial uses with a grant of up to $50,000 from En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>They can also choose to exit, with a one-off pay­ment of $30,000 to de­fray busi­ness ces­sa­tion costs. Ap­pli­ca­tions for both will have to be done by March 31.</p>
    <p>So far, SNBA has re­ceived around 90 queries about piv­ot­ing and ex­it­ing op­tions, the for­mer of which in­cludes a 12-month tem­po­rary change of li­cence – from nightlife to F&B or commercial busi­ness – which will be ex­pe­dited.</p>
    <p>The pivot grant will sup­port costs such as ren­o­va­tions and con­sul­tancy fees, and in­cludes a 20 per cent cash ad­vance.</p>
    <p>As the nightlife scene con­tends with be­ing among the last few in­dus­tries to re­open, SNBA sec­re­tary An­drew Ing said he hopes the pi­lot pro­gramme can be a tem­plate to kick-start the re­cov­ery process to re­open nightlife busi­nesses safely.</p>

    <p>COST OF COVID-19 TESTS</p>
    <p>We are hop­ing that who­ever comes to us with pro­pos­als for the pi­lot takes into ac­count that cus­tomers are likely go­ing to have to ab­sorb the cost of the tests.</p>

    <p>RESTARTING NIGHTLIFE SAFELY</p>
    <p>It’s about try­ing to find some­thing that’s go­ing to work in the in­dus­try, in the long term, un­til a vac­cine is found... We’re also hop­ing that op­er­a­tors will come up with their own in­no­va­tive ideas for how their cus­tomers will be kept safe.</p>
