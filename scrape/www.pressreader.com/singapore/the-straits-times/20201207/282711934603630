    <p>Par­ent­ing is tough, which is why busi­nesses tar­get par­ents with a slew of high-end prod­ucts touted to make the job eas­ier.</p>
    <p>Among this year’s of­fer­ings: in­fant suits that mon­i­tor if your baby is still breath­ing and socks that track their heart rate (so use­ful for when I used to stare at my first­born in the mid­dle of the night to check that he were alive); and baby mon­i­tors that live-stream ju­nior in full HD glory.</p>
    <p>A barista ma­chine that mixes baby for­mula to per­fec­tion?</p>
    <p>Bring it on. Change mats that weigh baby and cal­cu­late his or her rate of growth while you change poopy di­a­pers? Mm-kay.</p>
    <p>Blue­tooth-en­abled bassinets that can rock, swing, play white noise and sim­u­late a car ride at the touch of your smart­phone? A heck of an up­grade from the vi­brat­ing cot I shelled out for al­most 15 years ago.</p>
    <p>En­vy­ing new par­ents for the new­fan­gled ap­pli­ances avail­able to­day is one thing. Rais­ing teenagers is an­other. Here are some sci­ence-fic­tion doo-dads I wish I have to take the guess­work out of this baf­fling oc­cu­pa­tion.</p>
    <p>TEEN GRUNT TRANS­LA­TOR</p>
    <p>Let’s face it: Some­times, talk­ing to your teen is like ne­go­ti­at­ing with a Wookie.</p>
    <p>On a good day, I get about five grunts out of my 14-year-old.</p>
    <p>En­ter the TGT, an app for An­droid and iOS, which will solve such mys­ter­ies as “Are you hun­gry?” and “Have you taken a shower?”.</p>
    <p>Choose from four sooth­ing voices to an­swer you (Proper</p>
    <p>Pene­lope, Cheer­ful Cherie, Af­fec­tion­ate Alan and Eru­dite Eric), and 10 lev­els of po­lite­ness.</p>
    <p>“The TGT turned my life around!” a sat­is­fied cus­tomer might rave. “I was go­ing deaf pre­ma­turely from strain­ing my ears to catch the nu­ances in my teen’s grunts and mum­bles. But now, I know ex­actly what she means each time. And she’s stopped yelling at me for ask­ing her the same ques­tion five times.”</p>
    <p>Com­ing soon: the Adult Scream Trans­la­tor (for ages 18 and younger).</p>
    <p>VOICE MO­DU­LA­TOR</p>
    <p>From the mak­ers of the TGT and AST comes the Voice Mo­du­la­tor, which makes all your scold­ings come out sound­ing nice and rea­son­able. All you have to do is speak into the small de­vice and the is­sue you have will be com­mu­ni­cated in a way that is palat­able to your teen.</p>
    <p>Sub­scribe to pre­mium and you can trans­form your voice into your child’s favourite K-pop star’s for guar­an­teed at­ten­tion. De­vel­op­ers are work­ing with mu­sic com­pa­nies to let you de­liver your scold­ings in the form of rap chart-top­pers.</p>
    <p>AUTOCOOLYO­U3000</p>
    <p>If you, like me, have had to put up with ev­ery­day state­ments in your house­hold – such as “Eee... why you play this bor­ing game?” or “Aiyah, this song is so passe al­ready!” – then the AutoCoolYo­u3000 is for you.</p>
    <p>With this com­puter plug-in and Wi-Fi net­work mon­i­tor, you can au­to­mat­i­cally de­tect your teen’s current in­ter­ests and down­load every­thing you re­quire to know what he or she is talk­ing about.</p>
    <p>An op­tional neu­ral mod­ule al­lows you to down­load this in­for­ma­tion while you sleep, en­abling you to be­come an ex­pert overnight in what­ever your teen is try­ing to be good at, from the lat­est video game to the most ob­scure sport­ing fad. In­stant cred and re­spect.</p>
    <p>REMEM</p>
    <p>First mooted by sci­ence-fic­tion au­thor Ted Chi­ang in his short story col­lec­tion, Ex­ha­la­tion, Remem comes with a wear­able de­vice that lets in­di­vid­u­als record ev­ery sin­gle thing that hap­pens to them.</p>
    <p>This con­stant “live-log” can then be searched by a highly spe­cific and ef­fi­cient en­gine, so that one never for­gets any­thing ever again.</p>
    <p>Remem can pull up and screen an ar­gu­ment for you in your smart con­tact lens, the mo­ment your teen says: “Re­mem­ber when you scolded me, with­out Voice Mo­du­la­tor, for fail­ing my Higher Chi­nese?”</p>
    <p>In which case, you can re­view the ex­act footage im­me­di­ately and re­but ac­cu­rately: “No, I did not scold you. All I said was, try harder next time. And I was us­ing the Voice Mo­du­la­tor with the Lisa from Black­pink plug-in.”</p>
    <p>A life- (and face-) saver for par­ents ev­ery­where.</p>
    <p>PAR­ENT­ING PACK­AGE</p>
    <p>For par­ents who are look­ing for more bang for their buck, I rec­om­mend this four-in-one, all-round sur­vival kit in a trav­el­friendly pouch. The Cos­mic Calmer, Eye-rolling Ejec­tor, In­so­lence In­su­la­tor and Anger An­ti­dote are four in­dis­pens­able san­ity-savers for the fraz­zled mum or dad.</p>
    <p>Some­times, off­spring be­have in ways we can­not com­pre­hend. Rather than risk los­ing our cool in public or saying things we might re­gret later, why not try one of these prod­ucts?</p>
    <p>The Cos­mic Calmer is avail­able as a con­ve­nient morn­ing-be­fore pill in blis­ter packs of 10. The Eye-rolling Ejec­tor is a handy mist-spray that will dis­pel your child’s abil­ity to show his or her eye whites at you. To use the In­so­lence In­su­la­tor, sim­ply ap­ply the grease-free mois­turiser to your face in the morn­ing (it has anti-age­ing and UV-pro­tec­tion prop­er­ties too) and you will be­come in­ured to mi­nor rude­ness for 12 hours.</p>
    <p>Lastly, the Anger An­ti­dote is for those emer­gency sit­u­a­tions when you feel a parental ex­plo­sion com­ing on and want to head off the neg­a­tive vibes: Sim­ply break the seal on the 3ml con­tainer and swal­low con­tents for im­me­di­ate ef­fect.</p>
    <p>TEEN-BODY PROB­LEM SIMULATOR</p>
    <p>In Chi­nese writer Liu Cixin’s sci­ence-fic­tion novel The Three-Body Prob­lem, sci­en­tists play a vir­tual-re­al­ity (VR) sim­u­la­tion game to try and solve a physics and clas­si­cal me­chan­ics prob­lem.</p>
    <p>The simulator runs through en­tire civil­i­sa­tions as they try to pre­dict the move­ment of three suns and the ex­treme weather con­di­tion these move­ments bring.</p>
    <p>Tak­ing a leaf from this, the Teen-Body Prob­lem Simulator al­lows you to run var­i­ous par­ent­ing sce­nar­ios through VR to their log­i­cal con­clu­sion so you can pre­dict how your child will turn out if you did or didn’t do cer­tain things.</p>
    <p>With this simulator, par­ents will be armed with the spe­cific data they need to make the best de­ci­sions. Each Teen-Body Avatar is mod­elled on your unique child.</p>
    <p>Never lis­ten to other peo­ple’s well-mean­ing but com­pletely wrong ad­vice for rais­ing your teen again.</p>
    <p>Free! Child-clone re­place­ment if the simulator fails.</p>
