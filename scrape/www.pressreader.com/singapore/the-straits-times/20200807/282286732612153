    <p>LON­DON • With a 5-0 lead over Aus­tria’s Lask go­ing into the sec­ond leg of their Europa League last-16 tie, the out­come was al­ways a fore­gone con­clu­sion for Manch­ester United and so it proved on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Goals by Jesse Lin­gard and An­thony Mar­tial cancelled out a strike by Philipp Wiesinger for a 2-1 win on the night as the Red Dev­ils went through 7-1 on ag­gre­gate, set­ting up a quar­ter-fi­nal clash with FC Copen­hagen on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The game at Old Traf­ford was more of an op­por­tu­nity to ex­per­i­ment with sec­ond-string play­ers and blood young­sters like Te­den Mengi.</p>
    <p>The 18-year-old de­fender came off the bench to be­come the eighth United academy grad­u­ate to make his de­but this sea­son un­der Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer and was l ater show­ered with praise on so­cial me­dia from his se­nior team­mates.</p>
    <p>Bring­ing play­ers through the ranks was some­thing that for­mer man­ager Alex Fer­gu­son strongly be­lieved in and Paul Sc­holes feels that the Nor­we­gian is tak­ing a leaf out of his books.</p>
    <p>“Sir Alex Fer­gu­son was des­per­ate to get young play­ers play­ing and Ole has gone the same way,” the for­mer United mid­fielder said.</p>
    <p>“They have to be good enough of course and they think highly of this lad and let’s hope this is his first of many to come.</p>
    <p>“Let’s hope they can still keep on pro­duc­ing these young play­ers that the club is all about.”</p>
    <p>Talk­ing up Mengi’s prospects, Sol­sk­jaer added: “He’s a leader, a cen­tre-back. He’s one we be­lieve in. He’s in the same age group as Ma­son (Green­wood).</p>
    <p>“They grew up to­gether. He’s strong, quick, good on the ball. We’ve got a de­cent player there.”</p>
    <p>Sol­sk­jaer also con­firmed In­ter Mi­lan would be sign­ing for­ward</p>
    <p>Alexis Sanchez, who has been on loan at the San Siro for a year, per­ma­nently and the Ital­ian Serie A side yes­ter­day an­nounced that he had moved on a free trans­fer.</p>
    <p>United now head to Ger­many, where the re­main­der of the Europa League will be played.</p>
