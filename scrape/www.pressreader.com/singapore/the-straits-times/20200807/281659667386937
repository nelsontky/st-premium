    <p>A re­cruiter said not a sin­gle Sin­ga­porean was hired through the Jobs Bank in the three years she worked at an em­ploy­ment agency.</p>
    <p>Half her di­vi­sion, she added, was made up of for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>A bank ex­ec­u­tive re­counted that the trad­ing floor of the multi­na­tional bank where she works is crowded with em­ploy­ees from a par­tic­u­lar Asian coun­try, in­clud­ing their fam­ily mem­bers from the same re­gion in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>“How is it pos­si­ble that (they) are al­most al­ways the best per­son for the job or a pro­mo­tion?” she asked.</p>
    <p>These were among the com­ments The Straits Times re­ceived, af­ter the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) said on Wed­nes­day that more em­ploy­ers have been added to the Fair Con­sid­er­a­tion Frame­work (FCF) watch list for po­ten­tially dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices. MOM’s up­date came amid con­cerns from lo­cal job seek­ers that they are not get­ting a fair deal in a tough job mar­ket.</p>
    <p>But do Sin­ga­pore­ans lack the rel­e­vant skills?</p>
    <p>Busi­ness lead­ers in­ter­viewed by The Straits Times said some sec­tors do have a skills short­age that can be filled by for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>But they all agree there is no rea­son for com­pa­nies to hire work­ers only from a sin­gle for­eign na­tion­al­ity.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can Cham­ber of Com­merce in Sin­ga­pore said that based on its man­power sur­vey last year, Amer­i­can com­pa­nies here cited soft skills, in­clud­ing adapt­abil­ity, will­ing­ness to take risks, cre­ativ­ity and lead­er­ship skills, as be­ing the hard­est to find in lo­cal work­ers. This led them to hire for­eign­ers. Tech­ni­cal skills and mar­ket knowl­edge ranked fur­ther down the list of rea­sons firms gave for not hir­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean-Ger­man Cham­ber of In­dus­try and Com­merce coun­cil mem­ber Alexan­der Melch­ers cau­tioned against gen­er­al­is­ing why Sin­ga­pore­ans do not make the cut.</p>
    <p>The rea­sons tend to be in­dus­tryand com­pany-spe­cific, he said, cit­ing the short­age of skilled work­ers in the avi­a­tion sec­tor just be­fore Covid-19 struck.</p>
    <p>What about the fi­nan­cial ser­vices sec­tor, which has the lion’s share of new­com­ers on the FCF watch list?</p>
    <p>Mr Melch­ers said that if a Ger­man wealth man­age­ment firm sets up of­fice here, Ger­man clients tend to be more com­fort­able deal­ing with Ger­mans. This means it must have Ger­man speak­ers on board.</p>
    <p>He added that the Jobs Bank has thrown up in­ter­est­ing cur­ricu­lum vi­tae and “opened the eyes” of many Euro­pean com­pa­nies to the lo­cal tal­ent pool.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Cham­ber of Com­merce chief ex­ec­u­tive Vic­tor Mills said that as a small coun­try, Sin­ga­pore will never pro­duce enough tal­ent of its own, hence it has po­si­tioned it­self as a global tal­ent hub.</p>
    <p>But this is­sue has be­come emo­tion­ally sen­si­tive, es­pe­cially with the eco­nomic re­ces­sion, and it is right that the Gov­ern­ment wants to en­sure lo­cal can­di­dates get fair con­sid­er­a­tion, he said.</p>
    <p>What is “com­pletely un­ac­cept­able in any coun­try”, he added, is the prac­tice of re­cruit­ing from only one na­tion­al­ity. “It doesn’t make sense be­cause you want di­ver­sity of the work­force to bet­ter re­flect your cus­tomer base.”</p>
    <p>If some firms can­not be counted on to fol­low the rules, should the au­thor­i­ties is­sue fewer work passes and tighten the FCF frame­work?</p>
    <p>Mr David Leong, man­ag­ing direc­tor of hu­man re­sources firm Peo­pleWorld­wide Con­sult­ing, said one op­tion is to re­quire com­pa­nies to em­ploy lo­cal trainees or in­terns to pair with S Pass hold­ers, and take over their jobs when their contract is up.</p>
    <p>He noted the prob­lem of for­eign em­ploy­ees is es­pe­cially acute in the soft­ware, IT and fi­nan­cial sec­tors. The mid­dle- and back-room staff who work on project man­age­ment, pro­gram­ming and cod­ing tend to gather fa­mil­iar col­leagues from their home coun­try to work to­gether, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Melch­ers said the na­tional eco­nomic strat­egy must come first. “Where and how do we want to grow our econ­omy?</p>
    <p>“Then we need to be very spe­cific about where we can af­ford to re­duce the EPs (Em­ploy­ment Passes) or S Passes, and where we have enough train­ing in­sti­tutes and tal­ent that can pick up the skills fast enough, so we don’t stop the growth of these com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>“Oth­er­wise, they may go some­where else where they can find these tal­ents.”</p>
