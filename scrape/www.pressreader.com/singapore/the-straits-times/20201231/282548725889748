    <p>The na­tional hand­ball team will look to make amends at next year’s SEA Games in Viet­nam, with the sport listed among the 40 ap­proved for the bi­en­nial meet.</p>
    <p>At last year’s Games in the Philip­pines, Sin­ga­pore were white­washed, los­ing all their four men’s group matches 2-0 to fin­ish bot­tom of the in­au­gu­ral beach hand­ball event.</p>
    <p>But Hand­ball Fed­er­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (HFS) pres­i­dent Hong Zhen You and the team are con­fi­dent they can bounce back from the dis­ap­point­ment, es­pe­cially when both the seven-a-side in­door and four-a-side beach events are in­cluded in the pro­gramme in Hanoi.</p>
    <p>In­door hand­ball is mak­ing a re­turn to the SEA Games after its pre­vi­ous ap­pear­ance in 2007, when Sin­ga­pore did not field a team. The event de­buted at the 2003 Hanoi Games.</p>
    <p>Na­tional cen­tre Ervin Sethi said: “It was our first ma­jor com­pe­ti­tion for beach hand­ball and we had less ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>“As the di­men­sions and rules are dif­fer­ent, our more ex­pe­ri­enced op­po­nents were able to tweak their tac­tics bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>Com­pared to in­door hand­ball, the beach vari­a­tion is more dy­namic as it is played in a smaller area.</p>
    <p>Trick shots count for two points in­stead of one, and the match is played over two sets of 10 min­utes in­stead of two 30-minute halves.</p>
    <p>If both teams win one set each, the match will be de­cided by a penalty shoot-out.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam and Thai­land won gold and sil­ver re­spec­tively at the Su­bic Bay Freeport Zone and will be the teams to beat again.</p>
    <p>“We have learnt what we can im­prove on from the last SEA Games,” added Sethi, a mem­ber of the Sin­ga­pore team who fin­ished third at the 2015 South-east Asian Hand­ball Cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve we can fight for a podium fin­ish, es­pe­cially for the in­door event.”</p>
    <p>It is un­clear if there will be any women’s com­pe­ti­tions in Hanoi as the Games or­gan­is­ers need at least four par­tic­i­pat­ing coun­tries to in­clude an event.</p>
    <p>Ham Jia Yun, a mem­ber of the side who fin­ished ninth out of 10 teams at the 2018 Asian Women’s Hand­ball Cham­pi­onship, where Sin­ga­pore was the only Asean rep­re­sen­ta­tive, said: “Even dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, we did not stay still.</p>
    <p>“We did in­di­vid­ual ex­er­cises and re­ported to our coaches with photo and video ev­i­dence.”</p>
    <p>The back added: “We have been waiting so long for the sport to be in­cluded in the SEA Games, so nat­u­rally the women’s team were dis­ap­pointed when there was no women’s event last year. We hope we can be given a chance to rep­re­sent our coun­try after train­ing so hard for years.”</p>
    <p>But Hong knows the HFS will first have to con­vince the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Olympic Coun­cil that the teams are de­serv­ing of se­lec­tion by show­ing they can at least match the bronze medal­lists – the Philip­pines – from the last Games.</p>
    <p>HFS aims to or­gan­ise friendly matches against re­gional ri­vals and train­ing camps once the coro­n­avirus-en­forced travel re­stric­tions are eased.</p>
    <p>The na­tional teams re­sumed train­ing when Phase 2 of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing be­gan in June, work­ing in groups of five on over­load sce­nar­ios and drills, be­fore ex­pand­ing to four-ver­sus-four games when Phase 3 started on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Hong said: “We know we are bet­ter than what the results from the last SEA Games sug­gest... We want to aim for some­thing higher and not fix our eyes only on third place and think we can­not do bet­ter than that.”</p>
    <p>He is also heart­ened by the sport’s run at the SEA Games, and hopes it will spur in­ter­est and par­tic­i­pa­tion lo­cally and within the re­gion. Be­fore Covid-19 struck, the an­nual Na­tional Hand­ball League fea­tured about 30 men’s and 10 women’s teams in the six-month com­pe­ti­tion, and Hong es­ti­mates Sin­ga­pore has a pool of about 2,000 ac­tive play­ers from the league and schools.</p>
    <p>He said: “Most play­ers here pick up the game late so tech­ni­cally we could be a few years be­hind other na­tions.</p>
    <p>“We hope that as the pop­u­lar­ity of the sport grows, more can pick up hand­ball and de­velop their po­ten­tial from a younger age.”</p>
