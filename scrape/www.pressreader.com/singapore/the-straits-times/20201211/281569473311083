    <p>The free trade agree­ment (FTA) inked by the United King­dom and Sin­ga­pore yes­ter­day will of­fer “im­me­di­ate and tan­gi­ble” ben­e­fits for busi­nesses, said Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Chan Chun Sing.</p>
    <p>These in­clude tar­iff elim­i­na­tion for goods trade and in­creased ac­cess for gov­ern­ment pro­cure­ment mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Both na­tions are also work­ing to ap­ply the UK-Sin­ga­pore FTA im­me­di­ately after the Brexit tran­si­tion pe­riod ends.</p>
    <p>Here is a look at the key ben­e­fits for Sin­ga­pore busi­nesses un­der the deal, which will kick in on Jan 1:</p>
    <p>TAR­IFF ELIM­I­NA­TION, EN­HANCED MAR­KET AC­CESS</p>
    <p>The UK-Sin­ga­pore FTA will main­tain the same time­line for tar­iff re­duc­tions as the Euro­pean UnionSin­ga­pore FTA. This means that 84 per cent of Sin­ga­pore ex­ports en­ter­ing Bri­tain will con­tinue to be duty-free once the agree­ment en­ters into force. These in­clude Asian food products, elec­tron­ics, phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals and petro­chem­i­cals.</p>
    <p>By Nov 21, 2024, tar­iffs on vir­tu­ally all re­main­ing products will be elim­i­nated, such as on tex­tiles, fruits and se­lected meat and seafood pro­duce.</p>
    <p>Lib­eral and flex­i­ble rules of ori­gin for Bri­tain and Sin­ga­pore’s key ex­ports to each other’s mar­kets, such as cars, chem­i­cals, elec­tron­ics and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals, will con</p>
    <p>tinue to be pro­vided for.</p>
    <p>Asian food products made in Sin­ga­pore will con­tinue to en­joy en­hanced mar­ket ac­cess. For ex­am­ple, products such as har gow (prawn dumplings) and sam­bal ikan bilis (spicy crispy an­chovies) will be able to en­ter Bri­tain tar­iff­free, up to an an­nual com­bined quota of 350 tonnes.</p>
    <p>EN­HANCED MAR­KET AC­CESS IN SER­VICE SEC­TORS</p>
    <p>Ser­vice providers, pro­fes­sion­als and in­vestors will have en­hanced mar­ket ac­cess, cre­at­ing a level play­ing field for busi­nesses in both Bri­tain and Sin­ga­pore. This in­cludes sec­tor-spe­cific rules on nondis­crim­i­na­tion and trans­parency.</p>
    <p>A wide range of ser­vices is cov­ered un­der the agree­ment, in­clud­ing ar­chi­tec­ture, en­gi­neer­ing, man­age­ment con­sul­tancy, in­ter­na­tional mar­itime trans­port as well as ho­tel and restau­rant ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Stan­dard Char­tered Sin­ga­pore, for in­stance, will be en­ti­tled to ad­di­tional cus­tomer ser­vice lo­ca­tions un­der the FTA, the bank said yes­ter­day. This comes on top of the 50 lo­ca­tions which it is al­ready en­ti­tled to as a “Sig­nif­i­cantly Rooted For­eign Bank”, a frame­work un­der which it is ac­corded en­hanced priv­i­leges.</p>
    <p>IN­VEST­MENT PRO­TEC­TION, EN­HANCED IP RIGHTS</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore and Bri­tain have com­mit­ted to start ne­go­ti­a­tions for a high stan­dard in­vest­ment pro­tec­tion agree­ment within two years of the FTA com­ing into force, and aim to con­clude the ne­go­ti­a­tions within four years.</p>
    <p>The FTA also al­lows Sin­ga­pore and Bri­tain to con­tinue en­joy­ing a com­pre­hen­sive In­tel­lec­tual Prop­erty Rights Chap­ter which cov­ers copy­right, en­force­ment and ge­o­graph­i­cal in­di­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>RE­DUCED NON-TAR­IFF BAR­RI­ERS, LOWER COSTS FOR EX­PORTS</p>
    <p>The agree­ment will do away with un­nec­es­sary tech­ni­cal bar­ri­ers to trade for Sin­ga­pore and Bri­tish ex­porters, fa­cil­i­tat­ing trade and cre­at­ing a level play­ing field for firms in both ju­ris­dic­tions.</p>
    <p>Du­plica­tive test­ing and cer­ti­fi­ca­tion pro­ce­dures would be re­duced, low­er­ing op­er­a­tional costs for ex­porters. Sec­tors that could ben­e­fit in­clude elec­tron­ics, mo­tor vehicles and ve­hi­cle parts, phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals, re­new­able en­ergy, as well as meat and meat products.</p>
    <p>GOV­ERN­MENT PRO­CURE­MENT OP­POR­TU­NI­TIES</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore will be granted en­hanced ac­cess to city-level and mu­nic­i­pal-level gov­ern­ment pro­cure­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties in Bri­tain, which means that firms here can bid for more gov­ern­ment projects in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Firms that could ben­e­fit in­clude those in trans­port, fi­nan­cial ser­vices and util­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Asian food products made in Sin­ga­pore will con­tinue to en­joy en­hanced mar­ket ac­cess. For ex­am­ple, products such as har gow (prawn dumplings) and sam­bal ikan bilis (spicy crispy an­chovies) will be able to en­ter Bri­tain tar­iff-free, up to an an­nual com­bined quota of 350 tonnes.</p>
