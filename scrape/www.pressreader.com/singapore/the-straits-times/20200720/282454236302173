    <p>MADRID • Hav­ing achieved one of his main ob­jec­tives since re­turn­ing to Real Madrid for his sec­ond coach­ing spell, Zine­dine Zi­dane is con­sid­er­ing walk­ing away again.</p>
    <p>The French­man is on a high after lead­ing Real to their first La Liga ti­tle since 2017, but the Real job is one of the most, if not the most, de­mand­ing roles in club foot­ball.</p>
    <p>The pres­sure led to Zi­dane re­sign­ing in May 2018, just five days after win­ning a third straight Cham­pi­ons League crown.</p>
    <p>His sab­bat­i­cal from foot­ball lasted al­most 12 months and he re­turned in March last year to an­swer Real’s dis­tress call fol­low­ing the suc­ces­sive sack­ings of Julen Lopetegui and Santiago So­lari.</p>
    <p>He then signed a deal un­til the sum­mer of 2022, but the 1998 World Cup win­ner is re­main­ing non-com­mit­tal on his fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“I have a con­tract here but you never know what will hap­pen,” he said on Satur­day. “I am not talk­ing about what’s go­ing to hap­pen next sea­son or the fol­low­ing year.</p>
    <p>“I have a con­tract, I am happy here, and I am happy with what I am do­ing but you never know what will hap­pen in foot­ball.</p>
    <p>“That’s why I feel so re­laxed with my fu­ture be­cause in the world of foot­ball, things could change overnight.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know what’s go­ing to hap­pen in the fu­ture. I am happy with what I am do­ing here and we will see for how long.”</p>
    <p>With the La Liga sea­son end­ing yes­ter­day, Real now turn their at­ten­tion to­wards the sec­ond leg of their last-16 Cham­pi­ons League tie with Manch­ester City next month.</p>
    <p>Zi­dane’s men trail 2-1 ahead of the Aug 7 clash at the Eti­had, with Ju­ven­tus or Lyon wait­ing in the quar­ter-fi­nals in Por­tu­gal.</p>
    <p>A fourth Euro­pean Cup tri­umph and 12th piece of silverware would leave him just two shy of the record of 14 tro­phies won by Miguel Munoz, the club’s most suc­cess­ful coach. And the Real great is look­ing for­ward to lock­ing horns with City boss Pep Guardi­ola.</p>
    <p>“They are not go­ing to have two weeks off,” said Zi­dane, whose side will not be in com­pet­i­tive ac­tion un­til the trip to Manch­ester.</p>
    <p>“We are not on vacation. Let’s get some rest, but then our minds will be on City. The sea­son is not over.”</p>
