    <p>Lo­cal law gi­ant Harry Elias, who was the found­ing chair­man of the Law So­ci­ety’s Crim­i­nal Le­gal Aid Scheme (Clas) some 35 years ago, died on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>He was 83.</p>
    <p>His wife Thelma, 73, said he had a long ill­ness and died in hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Coun­sel Elias was among Sin­ga­pore’s best-known trial lawyers and the founder of one of Sin­ga­pore’s lead­ing law firms, Harry Elias Part­ner­ship.</p>
    <p>Trib­utes have poured in, eu­lo­gis­ing him for his last­ing con­tri­bu­tions, char­ac­ter and court-craft.</p>
    <p>Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon said the se­nior coun­sel rep­re­sented “some of the best and most im­por­tant qual­i­ties of our pro­fes­sion”.</p>
    <p>Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam said in a Face­book trib­ute that Mr Elias was an icon whose death marked “a pass­ing of a gen­er­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>Ms In­dra­nee Ra­jah, Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice, said of Mr Elias: “He was one of our greats – with a big booming voice, and rapier sharp as he did bat­tle in court. He was of­ten in the head­lines, his clients a list of who’s who.”</p>
    <p>He was one of her first bosses when she joined Drew & Napier as a le­gal as­sis­tant in 1988. He “never failed to teach”, she said.</p>
    <p>Law So­ci­ety pres­i­dent Gre­gory Vi­jayen­dran said Mr Elias’ great­est legacy was en­sur­ing ac­cess to jus­tice for the weak­est in so­ci­ety, adding that Clas, which helps more than a thou­sand peo­ple each year, is the so­ci­ety’s crown jewel.</p>
    <p>Harry Elias Part­ner­ship man­ag­ing part­ner Philip Fong said Mr Elias was “a trail­blazer with last­ing legacy”.</p>
    <p>Born in Sin­ga­pore in 1937 and ed­u­cated at St An­drew’s School, Mr Elias went on to read law in Lon­don, grad­u­at­ing in 1963 and qual­i­fy­ing as a bar­ris­ter at Lon­don’s Mid­dle Tem­ple.</p>
    <p>He never for­got the fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance he re­ceived from St An­drew’s School, which fa­cil­i­tated his ed­u­ca­tion at the school, and was a sup­port­ive alum­nus for decades.</p>
    <p>Mr Elias started as a lawyer in Kuala Lumpur in 1965 and re­turned to Sin­ga­pore in 1970, join­ing Drew & Napier.</p>
    <p>In 1988, he founded his own prac­tice, Harry Elias and Part­ners, later re­named Harry Elias Part­ner­ship.</p>
    <p>He also served as Law So­ci­ety pres­i­dent be­tween 1984 and 1986.</p>
    <p>Read­ing about the num­ber of low-in­come Sin­ga­pore­ans spurred him to set up Clas.</p>
    <p>He took on the first case un­der the scheme, se­cur­ing the dis­missal of charges against a woman ac­cused of steal­ing milk for her baby.</p>
    <p>Mr Elias was made se­nior coun­sel in 1997. Among the ac­co­lades he re­ceived over the years was the Law So­ci­ety’s CC Tan Award in 2005, which recog­nises mem­bers of the Sin­ga­pore Bar who have demon­strated hon­esty, fair play, per­sonal in­tegrity and cour­tesy.</p>
    <p>In 2013, he was con­ferred the Pub­lic Ser­vice Medal.</p>
    <p>Chief Jus­tice Menon told The Straits Times that al­though Mr Elias was very much se­nior to him, he had the priv­i­lege of in­ter­act­ing with the se­nior coun­sel quite ex­ten­sively over the last 30 years.</p>
    <p>He said: “We were on op­po­site sides in some cases, and I ap­peared be­fore him in ar­bi­tra­tion pro­ceed­ings and he ap­peared be­fore me in court. In all th­ese in­ter­ac­tions, Harry was uni­formly kind, con­sid­er­ate and a com­plete gen­tle­man.</p>
    <p>“He was al­ways ge­nial and al­ways able to bring some cheer into every tense sit­u­a­tion. He was scrupulous­ly fair in all his deal­ings, whether as coun­sel or as an ad­ju­di­ca­tor, and in this, he rep­re­sented some of the best and most im­por­tant qual­i­ties of our pro­fes­sion.</p>
    <p>“I shall miss Harry very much and I ex­tend my deep­est con­do­lences to his fam­ily and to his col­leagues in prac­tice.”</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam said Mr Elias was a much sought-af­ter lawyer.</p>
    <p>“And as a per­son, he was a gem of a man, larger than life, the life and soul of any meet­ing, party, gath­er­ing in and out of court, he was a gen­tle­man, known for his dry wit and dis­arm­ing charm,” he added.</p>
    <p>“Harry was de­clin­ing the last few times that I saw him. But his pass­ing is still a shock... The le­gal pro­fes­sion is poorer for the loss.”</p>
    <p>Ms In­dra­nee said in a Face­book post: “Harry had a good heart and a zest for life, a won­der­ful en­thu­si­asm that was both in­fec­tious and up­lift­ing. A great sense of hu­mour.</p>
    <p>“His con­tri­bu­tions and in­flu­ence live on – in the firms he led, the lawyers he men­tored, the out­comes of the cases he fought, the work he did in the Law So­ci­ety and the lead­er­ship he pro­vided as a se­nior mem­ber of the Bar.</p>
    <p>“Good­bye, Harry. You will be dearly missed. But never for­got­ten.”</p>
    <p>Mr Elias is also sur­vived by his daugh­ter and her hus­band, a grand­daugh­ter and two stepchil­dren.</p>
    <p>His son Jeremy died about nine years ago, said Mrs Elias.</p>
    <p>Mr Elias’ fu­neral was held yes­ter­day af­ter­noon at the Jewish Ceme­tery in Choa Chu Kang.</p>
    <p>SCRUPULOUS­LY FAIR IN ALL DEAL­INGS</p>
    <p>He was al­ways ge­nial and al­ways able to bring some cheer into every tense sit­u­a­tion. He was scrupulous­ly fair in all his deal­ings, whether as coun­sel or as an ad­ju­di­ca­tor, and in this, he rep­re­sented some of the best and most im­por­tant qual­i­ties of ’’ our pro­fes­sion.</p>
    <p>CHIEF JUS­TICE SUN­DARESH MENON,</p>
    <p>on Se­nior Coun­sel Harry Elias (above).</p>
