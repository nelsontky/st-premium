    <p>In­dian Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi’s farm re­forms are aimed at em­pow­er­ing farm­ers and giv­ing them greater lee­way in de­mand­ing higher prices for their pro­duce.</p>
    <p>But the strong­est protests to the re­forms have come from the In­dian farm­ers them­selves, the ma­jor­ity of whom have only small hold­ings and be­long to a much marginalis­ed sec­tion of the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The new leg­is­la­tion is aimed at en­cour­ag­ing farm­ers to sell their pro­duce di­rectly to pri­vate com­pa­nies in­stead of through reg­u­lated whole­sale mar­kets where car­tels and mid­dle­men are known to have taken root.</p>
    <p>It al­lows farm­ers to sell out­side their state with­out pay­ing a market fee or cess and cre­ates a frame­work for con­tract farm­ing.</p>
    <p>But farm­ers are not con­vinced it is for their good, while op­po­si­tion par­ties have added to the disquiet by ac­cus­ing the Bharatiya Janata Party gov­ern­ment of chang­ing the sys­tem to ben­e­fit cor­po­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, Par­lia­ment ap­proved the two farm Bills amid fierce crit­i­cism from op­po­si­tion par­ties and the rul­ing BJP’s own ally, the Shi­ro­mani Akali Dal, a party with a ru­ral base from the agrar­ian state of Pun­jab.</p>
    <p>Farm­ers are un­sure of deal­ing with large cor­po­ra­tions and scared that the gov­ern­ment will even­tu­ally step back from its tra­di­tional role of pro­vid­ing a min­i­mum price for sta­ple crops such as wheat and paddy.</p>
    <p>“There is a clear trust deficit be­tween the gov­ern­ment and farm­ers. Our de­mand is an as­sur­ance that the min­i­mum sup­port price will not be done away with. It should have been put into the farm Bills,” said Mr Ab­hi­manyu Ko­har, na­tional co­or­di­na­tor of Rashtriya Kisan Ma­hasangh, a fed­er­a­tion of 180 farmer groups.</p>
    <p>He said on­go­ing farmer protests will now take place across the coun­try against the Bills.</p>
    <p>India’s agri­cul­ture in­dus­try is be­set by mul­ti­ple prob­lems, in­clud­ing a fail­ure to boost pro­duc­tiv­ity, drought, poor ir­ri­ga­tion as well as the ris­ing cost of items like fer­tiliser and seeds.</p>
    <p>Land­hold­ings are se­verely im­pacted by crop fail­ure or lower prices for pro­duce, send­ing farm­ers, who are al­ready weighed down by loans, into fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment, which has em­barked on an out­reach pro­gramme to pro­mote the Bills, main­tains they will re­form a trou­bled sec­tor, though one that has per­formed sur­pris­ingly well in an oth­er­wise tank­ing econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Agri­cul­ture and al­lied ser­vices grew marginally in the first quar­ter, by 0.4 per cent to 3.4 per cent, com­pared to other sec­tors, which have con­tracted.</p>
    <p>“This change in the farm­ing sec­tor is the need of the present hour and our gov­ern­ment has brought this re­form for the farm­ers,” Mr Modi said in a vir­tual ad­dress yes­ter­day as part of the out­reach pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>“These farm Bills will em­power the farm­ers to freely trade their pro­duce any­where... Farm­ers can now sell their pro­duce at any cost they want. They would now be free to sell their prod­ucts any­where they want.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, there is un­cer­tainty over how the re­forms will be im­ple­mented and whether they will trans­late into bet­ter pay­ment or merely trans­pose farm­ers from one sys­tem of ex­ploita­tion – by the reg­u­lated car­tels – to an­other, where large buy­ers are able to com­mand prices.</p>
    <p>Mr Ke­shava Rao, an MP from the Te­lan­gana Rash­tra Samithi party, asked: “The law says it gives the farmer the free­dom to sell, but do you think farm­ers will be on a level play­ing field with cor­po­rates while ne­go­ti­at­ing the price?”</p>
    <p>In the south­ern state of Ker­ala, the gov­ern­ment has op­posed the new laws pro­mot­ing con­tract farm­ing. The state has long banned pri­vate com­pa­nies from en­ter­ing farm­ing to pro­tect its mostly small farm­ers from price ex­ploita­tion and to pre­vent mono-crop­ping and in­ten­sive use of fer­tilis­ers.</p>
    <p>Ker­ala’s Agri­cul­ture Min­is­ter VS Su­nil Ku­mar said: “The new pol­icy would give multi­na­tion­als and pri­vate cor­po­ra­tions full dom­i­na­tion over our farms, seeds, fer­tilis­ers.”</p>
    <p>Only 36 per cent of farm pro­duce in India is sold in the whole­sale mar­kets. All other trade, es­pe­cially for small and mar­ginal farm­ers, hap­pens through di­rect pro­cure­ment by states, from farm gates and by pro­ces­sors like cot­ton or sugar mills. The gross do­mes­tic prod­uct share of agri­cul­ture is around 15 per cent.</p>
    <p>The states of Ker­ala, Bi­har and Sikkim have scrapped state-run mar­kets in the past, but ex­perts say that the move did not ben­e­fit farm­ers sig­nif­i­cantly.</p>
    <p>“Man­dis (state-run mar­kets) them­selves are not the prob­lem. It is the ex­ploita­tion re­lated to price fix­ing, cheat­ing in weigh­ing, opaque trans­ac­tions, and late or par­tial pay­ments,” said Mr Chama­rasa Mali­patil, pres­i­dent of an in­flu­en­tial farm­ers’ rights group in Kar­nataka.</p>
    <p>Farm­ers like Mr Mali­patil worry that the new laws do not fix these con­cerns, and that invit­ing new big buy­ers and re­mov­ing gov­ern­ment over­sight might even make things worse.</p>
    <p>The new laws of­fer griev­ance re­dress, but many farm­ers’ groups in­sist that dis­pute res­o­lu­tion be­tween farm­ers and big cor­po­ra­tions is not a bat­tle be­tween equals.</p>
