    <p>The re­cently an­nounced re­cip­ro­cal green lane agree­ment be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia is a small but sig­nif­i­cant step for­ward, not just bi­lat­er­ally but also in the broader con­text of how coun­tries in South-east Asia can safely re­open their bor­ders amid an on­go­ing pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Set to be­gin on Aug 10, it could be the pre­cur­sor to an even­tual Asean-wide “travel bub­ble”. More im­me­di­ately, it of­fers an im­por­tant first test case of how coun­tries can suc­cess­fully lift re­stric­tions bit by bit while keep­ing the spread of the coro­n­avirus in check.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore-Malaysia green lane is, as the name sug­gests, a lane, not a highway. It lim­its cross-bor­der travel to long-term pass hold­ers and trav­ellers on es­sen­tial or of­fi­cial busi­ness.</p>
    <p>There are also re­stric­tions un­der the ac­com­pa­ny­ing pe­ri­odic com­mut­ing ar­range­ment.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, those al­lowed to travel un­der this ar­range­ment must re­main in their coun­try of work for at least three con­sec­u­tive months be­fore be­ing al­lowed to re­turn home for short-term leave.</p>
    <p>Health pro­to­cols and other pro­ce­dural de­tails are still be­ing worked out and will be pub­lished only 10 days be­fore the im­ple­men­ta­tion date.</p>
    <p>In short, the rules of the road, as it were, are still be­ing worked out and will likely need to be ad­justed along the way as these are put to the test in real life.</p>
    <p>As things im­prove and greater con­fi­dence is gained, the hope is that other Asean mem­ber states can learn from it, adopt it and adapt it, and in time, smaller bi­lat­eral travel bub­bles in the re­gion will co­a­lesce fi­nally into an Asean one.</p>
    <p>For that to hap­pen, a num­ber of things need to hap­pen.</p>
    <p>COM­MON RULES AND STAN­DARDS</p>
    <p>First, greater har­mon­i­sa­tion of stan­dards is needed.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore-Malaysia agree­ment has taken a step in that di­rec­tion by man­dat­ing that trav­ellers will need to abide strictly by “Covid-19 preven­tion and pub­lic health mea­sures mu­tu­ally agreed upon by both coun­tries”.</p>
    <p>Be­yond the reg­u­la­tory har­mon­i­sa­tion, there will also need to be down­stream mu­tual recog­ni­tion of test­ing, lab­o­ra­tory and epi­demi­o­logic sur­veil­lance stan­dards.</p>
    <p>The ex­pe­ri­ence af­ter the agree­ment goes “live” on Aug 10 will pro­vide prac­ti­cal knowl­edge on how that works out and will be use­ful for other Asean mem­bers plan­ning sim­i­lar bi­lat­eral ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>In a sim­i­lar vein, all mem­bers of a re­gion-wide travel bub­ble should strive to avoid du­pli­ca­tion and con­fu­sion for trav­ellers by agree­ing on a com­mon stan­dard for es­sen­tials such as health dec­la­ra­tion forms and move­ment track­ing apps.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, Asean as a supra-na­tional en­tity must take greater lead­er­ship in build­ing the in­fra­struc­ture and in­sti­tu­tions in or­der to lay the foun­da­tions for a South-east Asian “safe travel zone”.</p>
    <p>For starters, com­mon rules need to be es­tab­lished and en­forced.</p>
    <p>Pro­vi­sions must also be made for un­fore­seen changes in cir­cum­stances and un­ex­pected sce­nar­ios given the volatile na­ture of the pan­demic. A way must be found to re­solve dis­putes, such as over bor­der con­trols, should the ex­ist­ing guide­lines prove to be in­ad­e­quate. Asean’s found­ing prin­ci­ple of non-in­ter­fer­ence will likely be sorely tested if there is no bind­ing means of de­ci­sion-mak­ing.</p>
    <p>AN ASEAN CDC</p>
    <p>We be­lieve an Asean Cen­tre for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion (CDC) will be a use­ful com­po­nent in ef­forts to set up a re­gional travel bub­ble. Just as the Euro­pean Medicines Agency de­ter­mines reg­u­la­tions for phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals across the Euro­pean Union and is bind­ing on mem­bers, so an Asean CDC can in­de­pen­dently set out pub­lic health poli­cies for re­gional travel, co­or­di­nate test­ing stan­dards and lab­o­ra­tory stan­dards and con­duct multi-coun­try sur­veil­lance.</p>
    <p>It can also play the role of “neu­tral ar­biter”, one that is crit­i­cal as coun­tries un­der­stand­ably have na­tional in­ter­ests to pro­tect in the event of dis­putes. Along with the Asean CDC, there should be a mech­a­nism to re­solve dif­fer­ences and avoid full-scale with­drawal from the re­gional travel bub­ble.</p>
    <p>Third, we rec­om­mend a for­mal fort­nightly re­view process, sim­i­lar to the EU model, to be built into the re­gional travel frame­work given the fluid na­ture of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>RULES-BASED EX­ITS</p>
    <p>It is best if all are agreed on an ob­jec­tive, mea­sur­able trig­ger for a coun­try’s tem­po­rary ex­clu­sion from the bub­ble so that de­ci­sions can be taken quickly and apo­lit­i­cally.</p>
    <p>These “tem­po­rary ex­clu­sions” from travel bub­ble ar­range­ments should be built into the le­gal in­stru­ments signed be­tween sov­er­eign coun­tries to es­tab­lish travel bub­bles in or­der to pro­tect pub­lic health and the re­la­tion­ships be­tween coun­tries.</p>
    <p>With­out these rules-based au­to­matic ex­its, there is a risk of diplo­matic fall­out if coun­tries ex­pe­ri­enc­ing spikes in Covid-19 cases find their travel priv­i­leges sus­pended. In­deed, the threat of tem­po­rary ex­clu­sions is also use­ful to mo­ti­vate all coun­tries to main­tain high Covid-19 preven­tion stan­dards and hence main­tain their travel priv­i­leges.</p>
    <p>Fourth, re­open­ing should be man­aged with care. This is dis­cernible in the Sin­ga­pore-Malaysia ar­range­ment’s re­stricted list of who gets to be al­lowed in first. In the re­gion-wide con­text, a sim­i­lar grad­ual open­ing can, for in­stance, put health­care work­ers, diplo­mats and busi­ness peo­ple in the pri­or­ity list, fol­lowed by oth­ers such as stu­dents, and those trav­el­ling for fam­ily rea­sons and con­fer­ences.</p>
    <p>Tourists should come in at the end, di­vided into short-term and longer-term vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, reg­u­la­tory frame­works be­tween gov­ern­ments are nec­es­sary but in­suf­fi­cient. Much more is needed and in­sur­ers, em­ploy­ers and health­care providers will need to step up too.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers don’t just need to cross bor­ders, they also need peace of mind. And this peace of mind will come from clar­ity on mat­ters such as ac­cess to health­care in each other’s coun­tries, cov­er­age of travel in­sur­ance, repa­tri­a­tion pro­cesses and so on.</p>
    <p>MUCH AT STAKE</p>
    <p>Since March this year, al­most all South-east Asian coun­tries have in­sti­tuted bor­der con­trols to pre­vent the im­por­ta­tion of Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>These bor­der con­trols have been help­ful to buy time to ready coun­tries for the surge in Covid-19 cases but they can­not re­main in place in­def­i­nitely, es­pe­cially since it may take sev­eral years to find, man­u­fac­ture and ad­min­is­ter an ef­fec­tive Covid-19 vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Re­open­ing bor­ders is in­evitable de­spite the pub­lic health con­cerns.</p>
    <p>Our trade, sup­ply chains, food se­cu­rity, ed­u­ca­tion and fa­mil­ial ties are sim­ply too in­ter-linked to sus­tain pro­longed bor­der clo­sures.</p>
    <p>The crit­i­cal ques­tion be­fore us is, how do we safely re­open bor­ders in South-east Asia in a way that pro­tects pub­lic health, min­imises dis­rup­tions and max­imises ef­fec­tive­ness?</p>
    <p>All of us are in un­charted ter­ri­tory and the Sin­ga­pore-Malaysia pi­lot will be an es­sen­tial pre­cur­sor to an Asean travel bub­ble.</p>
    <p>It is im­por­tant that we draw as many use­ful lessons from it as pos­si­ble and make the pi­lot work.</p>
    <p>It is best if all are agreed on an ob­jec­tive, mea­sur­able trig­ger for a coun­try’s tem­po­rary ex­clu­sion from the bub­ble so that de­ci­sions can be taken quickly and apo­lit­i­cally... With­out these rules-based au­to­matic ex­its, there is a risk of diplo­matic fall­out if coun­tries ex­pe­ri­enc­ing spikes in Covid-19 cases find their travel priv­i­leges sus­pended.</p>
