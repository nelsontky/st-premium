    <p>Busi­nesses that are hurt by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and need to liq­ui­date will soon be able to do so in an eas­ier way.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment is look­ing at a sim­pli­fied liq­ui­da­tion scheme to help these busi­nesses wind up so that the peo­ple be­hind the busi­nesses are not hurt in the long term, said Sec­ond Minister for Law Edwin Tong yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“If you al­low the company to fail, and the usual con­se­quences of bank­ruptcy and all that fol­low, then it’s dif­fi­cult for the in­di­vid­ual to res­ur­rect the busi­ness even when the econ­omy picks up,” he said. “So we’re look­ing at a form of sim­pli­fy­ing the process, mak­ing sure those who can re­struc­ture or can find new in­vestors can do so eas­ily.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tong, who is also Minister for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth, made the com­ments dur­ing a pub­lic we­bi­nar hosted by Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity’s (SMU) Pro Bono Cen­tre on the chal­lenges for in­di­vid­u­als, fam­i­lies and busi­ness dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>They come two weeks af­ter Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said on Aug 17 that a small num­ber of busi­nesses that may not be able to re­open soon, such as those in the nightlife in­dus­try, will get help in tran­si­tion­ing to other ac­tiv­i­ties or to ease their exit.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Tong also said the Gov­ern­ment is look­ing to pro­vide com­pa­nies – such as those in travel</p>
    <p>HELP­ING HAND</p>
    <p>or in the meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­fer­ences and ex­hi­bi­tions sec­tor – with a sim­pli­fied way to re­struc­ture their busi­nesses, as these firms would oth­er­wise not sur­vive in the short term due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In some cases where re­struc­tur­ing does not work to im­prove the sus­tain­abil­ity of these busi­nesses, the sim­pli­fied liq­ui­da­tion process will help pre­vent in­di­vid­u­als be­hind them from be­ing fi­nan­cially dam­aged in the long run, he said.</p>
    <p>He added that de­spite gov­ern­ment mea­sures, there will be “un­even­ness” on the ground, which will be in­evitable.</p>
    <p>But the goal of the mea­sures is to make sure that Sin­ga­pore­ans and busi­nesses are best placed to take ad­van­tage of the up­turn once the econ­omy is back on track, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong was one of four pan­el­lists at the we­bi­nar, along­side Law So­ci­ety of Sin­ga­pore pres­i­dent Gre­gory Vi­jayen­dran; SMU vice-provost for fac­ulty matters Lee Pey Woan; and Trans Fam­ily Ser­vice Cen­tre (Be­dok Reser­voir) di­rec­tor Jer­maine Quek.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the ses­sion, Mr Tong also said the Gov­ern­ment will be look­ing at ex­tend­ing the time­frame for al­ter­na­tive ar­range­ments for hold­ing an­nual gen­eral meet­ings un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act in­tro­duced in April. The cur­rent dead­line is the end of this month.</p>
    <p>The move will give com­pa­nies, so­ci­eties and char­i­ties cer­tainty in car­ry­ing on with their meet­ings, which may take months to plan and or­gan­ise, he added.</p>
    <p>If you al­low the company to fail, and the usual con­se­quences of bank­ruptcy and all that fol­low, then it’s dif­fi­cult for the in­di­vid­ual to res­ur­rect the busi­ness even when the econ­omy picks up. So we’re look­ing at a form of sim­pli­fy­ing the process, mak­ing sure those who can re­struc­ture or can find new in­vestors can do so eas­ily.</p>
