    <p>A new fa­cil­ity built on a por­tion of an open-air carpark in Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal (SGH) will add 50 iso­la­tion sin­gle rooms to the hos­pi­tal’s ex­ist­ing 35 to sup­port the coun­try’s fight against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>It will start ad­mit­ting con­firmed and sus­pected Covid-19 pa­tients from to­day. The fa­cil­ity will also ad­mit pa­tients with other in­fec­tious dis­eases, such as tu­ber­cu­lo­sis and measles.</p>
    <p>Work on the 3,200 sq m fa­cil­ity, which is named Ward@Bowyer as it is l ocated ad­ja­cent to SGH’s Bowyer Block, started in mid-May dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod and was com­pleted over seven weeks.</p>
    <p>The ex­ist­ing iso­la­tion ward for in­fec­tious dis­eases in SGH – Ward 68 – has 35 sin­gle rooms and 16 beds in non-sin­gle rooms.</p>
    <p>Some of the roughly 300 Covid-19 pa­tients in SGH dur­ing</p>
    <p>April and May had to be roomed in other wards, said the SGH med­i­cal board’s chair­man, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ruban Poopalalin­gam.</p>
    <p>Of the 100 or so Covid-19 pa­tients now in SGH, some – in­clud­ing in­com­ing pa­tients – will be sent to Ward@Bowyer.</p>
    <p>The hos­pi­tal sees 40 to 50 sus­pected Covid-19 pa­tients each day.</p>
    <p>The new ward is part of the na­tional plan to in­crease ca­pac­ity for Covid-19 cases, Prof Poopalalin­gam said. “This ward is not built as a per­ma­nent fix­ture for the long run. It is built to at least last the dis­tance of the pan­demic and hope­fully be­yond for other in­fec­tious dis­eases.”</p>
    <p>Ward@Bowyer is built to last a few years, he added.</p>
    <p>“But we are happy with the in­crease in ca­pac­ity of iso­la­tion rooms be­cause (the ward) can be used be­yond the Covid era. Apart from the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases, there is not a lot of these in­fec­tious dis­eases iso­la­tion rooms in the coun­try.”</p>
    <p>Pa­tients who are sent to Ward@Bowyer must be able to walk about and take care of them­selves, and have con­di­tions as­sessed as less likely to de­te­ri­o­rate.</p>
    <p>Each iso­la­tion room mea­sures 2.3m by 5.6m with a height of 2.5m, and in­cludes an at­tached toi­let and shower. The rooms are de­signed to con­tain vi­ral par­ti­cles, which are then re­moved through spe­cialised ex­haust vents.</p>
    <p>The med­i­cal team will use con­tact-free mon­i­tor­ing to de­tect warn­ing signs of pa­tient de­te­ri­o­ra­tion and will thus be able to in­ter­vene early.</p>
    <p>For i nstance, pa­tients will be given a biosen­sor to wear on their wrists which will al­low their heart rate, res­pi­ra­tion rate and oxy­gen sat­u­ra­tion level read­ings to be wire­lessly trans­mit­ted to clin­i­cians.</p>
    <p>The pa­tients can also check their own vi­tal signs as the in­for­ma­tion will be sent to a mo­bile app which they can ac­cess through in-room smart­phones.</p>
    <p>We are happy with the in­crease in ca­pac­ity of iso­la­tion rooms be­cause (the ward) can be used be­yond the Covid era. Apart from the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases, there is not a lot of these in­fec­tious dis­eases iso­la­tion rooms in the coun­try.</p>
