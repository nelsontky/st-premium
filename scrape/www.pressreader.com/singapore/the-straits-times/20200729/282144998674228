    <p>Be­fore con­sumer In­ter­net firm Sea be­came one of South-east Asia’s most well-known tech names, the com­pany was a scrappy start-up work­ing out of a small shop­house of­fice in Maxwell Road in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Founded by Mr For­rest Li in 2009, Sea went public on the New York Stock Ex­change in Oc­to­ber 2017 and has since grown into a US$54.2 bil­lion (S$75 bil­lion) com­pany.</p>
    <p>Mr Li, who is chief ex­ec­u­tive and chair­man of the group, helmed Sea as it evolved from a games pub­lisher called Garena into a re­gional heavy­weight with busi­nesses in gam­ing, e-com­merce and dig­i­tal fi­nance.</p>
    <p>Sea’s e-com­merce plat­form, Shopee, is now one of the fastest­grow­ing re­gional play­ers and op­er­ates across South-east Asia and Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>“Our com­pany’s mis­sion is to bet­ter the lives of con­sumers and small busi­nesses through tech­nol­ogy – and I be­lieve that this mis­sion is more im­por­tant now than ever given the dis­rup­tions we are all fac­ing as a re­sult of the coro­n­avirus cri­sis,” Mr Li said in May as the group re­leased its first-quar­ter re­sults.</p>
    <p>“The coro­n­avirus cri­sis is driv­ing a step change in the growth of the dig­i­tal econ­omy glob­ally, ma­te­ri­ally ac­cel­er­at­ing a shift to on­line life­styles that is broad, deep and, in our view, ir­re­versible.”</p>
    <p>Be­sides his role at Sea, Mr Li is also a mem­ber of the board of di­rec­tors of the Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Board. He serves as an in­de­pen­dent non-ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of ShangriLa Asia, a lead­ing global hos­pi­tal­ity group listed on the Hong Kong Stock Ex­change.</p>
    <p>Mr Li grad­u­ated from Stan­ford Univer­sity with a Mas­ter of Busi­ness Ad­min­is­tra­tion de­gree and holds a bach­e­lor’s de­gree in en­gi­neer­ing from Shang­hai Jiao Tong Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>As the re­gional start-up ecosys­tem hots up and the pan­demic brings the dig­i­tal econ­omy to the fore, Mr Li will be talk­ing about his en­tre­pre­neur­ial jour­ney and what is in store for Sea dur­ing a vir­tual in­ter­ac­tive fo­rum to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Called Cut­ting Edge and or­gan­ised by The Straits Times and The Busi­ness Times, the se­ries show­cases thought lead­ers from var­i­ous fields and fea­tures au­di­ence par­tic­i­pa­tion.</p>
    <p>The fo­rum is spon­sored by Guo­coLand and mod­er­ated by Straits Times as­so­ciate edi­tor Vikram Khanna.</p>
    <p>Mr Li will be the fi­nal per­son­al­ity to be fea­tured in the se­ries.</p>
    <p>“The Cut­ting Edge se­ries was con­ceived at a time when busi­nesses have been fac­ing in­creas­ing rates of dis­rup­tion and in­creas­ing fre­quency of ‘black swan’ events,” said</p>
    <p>Guo­coLand group man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Cheng Hs­ing Yao.</p>
    <p>“It was called Cut­ting Edge be­cause we wanted to learn from suc­cess­ful in­di­vid­u­als how they stay at the fore­front of trends when con­ceiv­ing their prod­ucts and services, and how they plan their busi­nesses.”</p>
    <p>Past speak­ers in­clude Mr Howard Yu, an ex­pert on in­no­va­tion and cor­po­rate dis­rup­tion, ven­ture cap­i­tal­ist Jenny Lee and One Cham­pi­onship founder and chair­man Cha­tri Si­ty­o­d­tong.</p>
    <p>The we­bi­nar will run from 10am to 11.30am to­mor­row. To reg­is­ter, visit cut­tingedge.sphevents.com.sg</p>
