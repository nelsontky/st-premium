    <p>A few years back, then Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe star­tled a global gath­er­ing of top politi­cians and busi­ness­men in Switzer­land with his claim that Ja­pan’s pe­ri­odic con­fronta­tions with China are like “the same sit­u­a­tion” Britain and Ger­many faced early in the 20th cen­tury that led to World War I.</p>
    <p>More re­cently, sev­eral an­a­lysts have ar­gued that the ar­ti­fi­cial is­lands and mil­i­tary bases which the Chi­nese mil­i­tary is con­struct­ing in the South China Sea are rem­i­nis­cent of the heavy for­ti­fi­ca­tions which France built against Ger­many in the run-up to World War II.</p>
    <p>And it is by now com­mon­place to hear some­one pre­dict­ing the imminent re­turn of the Cold War, that epic con­fronta­tion be­tween the Soviet Union and the United States, but this time with China as Amer­ica’s chief en­emy.</p>
    <p>His­tor­i­cal analo­gies – ar­gu­ments that, be­cause there are sim­i­lar­i­ties be­tween events hap­pen­ing to­day and those which took place in the past, we can be guided by his­tory in mak­ing bet­ter de­ci­sions – are so fre­quently made that we hardly even no­tice them.</p>
    <p>And many of the his­tor­i­cal analo­gies cur­rently used in de­bates about for­eign pol­icy and in­ter­na­tional se­cu­rity con­cern China, for the sim­ple rea­son that the rise of China to su­per­power sta­tus is one of the defin­ing de­vel­op­ments of our era.</p>
    <p>So do we then scram­ble for guid­ance in the his­tory books?</p>
    <p>At first sight, the act of be­ing aware of his­tor­i­cal ex­am­ples which may have bear­ing on the present is clearly ben­e­fi­cial; as the Amer­i­can philoso­pher Ge­orge San­tayana fa­mously wrote: “Those who can­not re­mem­ber the past are con­demned to re­peat it.”</p>
    <p>Yet, as the cur­rent dis­cus­sions over China fre­quently prove, those who take his­tor­i­cal analo­gies too se­ri­ously run the risk of se­ri­ously mis­in­ter­pret­ing both past and present.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Yuen Foong Khong of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Singapore is prob­a­bly the top au­thor­ity on the use of his­tor­i­cal analo­gies; his Analo­gies At War was pub­lished al­most three decades ago, went through no fewer than six reprints in the English lan­guage and is still re­garded as the stan­dard text­book on the topic.</p>
    <p>A POW­ER­FUL SHORT­HAND</p>
    <p>An el­e­ment of Prof Khong’s ar­gu­ment is that lead­ers need his­tor­i­cal analo­gies to make sense of the huge amount of in­for­ma­tion that bom­bards them daily, and to jus­tify the choices they make to the wider elec­torate. Hu­man be­ings, he ar­gues, have “lim­ited com­pu­ta­tional ca­pac­i­ties”, so re­sort­ing to his­tor­i­cal analo­gies not only pro­vides a com­pass for de­ci­sion mak­ers, it also of­fers them a short­hand ex­pla­na­tion as to why they should re­act in a par­tic­u­lar way.</p>
    <p>There is no ques­tion that his­tor­i­cal analo­gies are pow­er­ful sig­nals and pol­icy in­stru­ments. When a Rus­sian leader in­vokes the “spirit of the Great Pa­tri­otic War”, he ap­peals in one short sen­tence not only to his peo­ple’s sense of self-sac­ri­fice about the war in the 1940s which killed about 20 mil­lion Rus­sians, but also re­minds them that Rus­sia can tri­umph against all odds.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a sin­gle ref­er­ence to the so-called “Cen­tury of Na­tional Hu­mil­i­a­tion” can pro­vide a Chi­nese leader with all the his­tor­i­cal analo­gies re­quired to jus­tify any de­ci­sion – from the re­jec­tion of a trade de­mand, and right up to a re­fusal to dis­cuss ter­ri­to­rial dis­putes.</p>
    <p>Still, all this ref­er­ence to his­tory comes at a price. For his­tor­i­cal analo­gies may sound con­vinc­ing but are of­ten se­ri­ously mis­lead­ing. And de­ci­sion mak­ers who take them too se­ri­ously can end up mak­ing cat­a­strophic er­rors.</p>
    <p>Take as an ex­am­ple the fre­quent his­tor­i­cal anal­ogy be­tween the pe­riod lead­ing to the start of</p>
    <p>World War I in 1914, and the sup­posed dan­gers of war from the ris­ing ten­sions be­tween China and the US to­day.</p>
    <p>To the unini­ti­ated, the anal­ogy seems per­sua­sive. Just as in 1914, we have to­day great pow­ers which are in de­cline, while other pow­ers are ris­ing fast. Just as was the case be­fore World War I, the key strate­gic ri­vals are locked into a close trade re­la­tion­ship and strate­gic ri­valry at the same time. And as was the case at the start of the 20th cen­tury in Europe, a mas­sive arms race is un­fold­ing in Asia to­day.</p>
    <p>But to list all th­ese sim­i­lar­i­ties is to ig­nore some fun­da­men­tal dif­fer­ences.</p>
    <p>To start with, to­day’s world is gov­erned by in­ter­na­tional in­sti­tu­tions in ways which were un­think­able a cen­tury ago. There are also more de­ci­sion mak­ers than in the past; gone are the days when the per­sonal pride of kings and em­per­ors de­cided things, or when a few sen­tences in a tele­gram made the dif­fer­ence be­tween war and peace.</p>
    <p>The ex­is­tence of nu­clear weapons has also changed the equa­tion; all those na­tions which marched to war in the sum­mer of 1914 fully ex­pected to be home by the end of that year, a mis­take no cur­rent leader any­where can make about a global nu­clear con­fronta­tion. In short, the dif­fer­ences are more sig­nif­i­cant than the ap­par­ent sim­i­lar­i­ties with this his­tor­i­cal anal­ogy.</p>
    <p>NOT A MAR­ITIME MAGINOT LINE</p>
    <p>Then, there are analo­gies that are based on a wrong un­der­stand­ing of his­tory. This is the case with the sug­ges­tion that China’s be­hav­iour in the South China Sea re­sem­bles French de­fen­sive be­hav­iour on the eve of World War II, when France built large for­ti­fi­ca­tions on its bor­der with Ger­many. The fa­mous Maginot Line cost the French a for­tune to build, but was use­less be­cause it was sim­ply by­passed by Ger­man forces which went on to de­feat France with light­ning speed.</p>
    <p>Those who un­til re­cently claimed that Bei­jing is con­struct­ing its own Maginot Line in the South China Sea im­plied ei­ther that China was merely adopt­ing a de­fen­sive po­si­tion, or that it is en­gaged in a mas­sive use­less project which would ul­ti­mately be a strate­gic flop. Or, per­haps, a mix­ture of both.</p>
    <p>But all th­ese ar­gu­ments are based on an anal­ogy which is sim­ply wrong. France built its for­ti­fi­ca­tions dur­ing the 1930s not be­cause it be­lieved that th­ese would work, but as com­pen­sa­tion for its fun­da­men­tal strate­gic in­fe­ri­or­ity against Ger­many. France was also not de­feated be­cause it put all its “eggs” in the for­ti­fi­ca­tions “bas­ket”, but be­cause it had the wrong strat­egy.</p>
    <p>Ei­ther way, and re­gard­less of what one thinks are China’s true ob­jec­tives in the South China Sea, the com­par­isons to France in the 1930s are sim­ply ir­rel­e­vant. Chi­nese lead­ers ap­pear fully in­tent to match US mil­i­tary ca­pa­bil­i­ties and most cer­tainly do not be­lieve that they are doomed to re­main in­fe­rior in mil­i­tary terms, China is spend­ing only a frac­tion of its cash in the South China Sea and most cer­tainly no one in Bei­jing be­lieves that for­ti­fi­ca­tions around a few is­lands are the back­bone of the coun­try’s real de­fence strat­egy.</p>
    <p>In short, the en­tire his­tory-based anal­ogy is just a dis­trac­tion, and a dan­ger­ous one be­cause it ob­scures the need for a real un­der­stand­ing of China’s be­hav­iour and ob­jec­tives.</p>
    <p>THE PROB­LEM WITH ‘AP­PEASE­MENT’</p>
    <p>Then, there are his­tor­i­cal analo­gies which are so fre­quently and so in­ap­pro­pri­ately thrown around as to be ut­terly use­less. That is the case with “ap­pease­ment”, to the process on the eve of World War II when most of Europe’s na­tions – in­clud­ing Britain, France, and the Soviet Union – sought to be friends with Nazi leader Adolf Hitler in the hope of avoid­ing a war with the dic­ta­tor.</p>
    <p>Ap­pease­ment is now a by­word for a pol­icy which is not only doomed to fail, but which is also im­moral. It is of­ten used as a term of abuse against peo­ple ad­vo­cat­ing a di­a­logue with to­day’s Rus­sia and, some­times, even against those ad­vo­cat­ing good re­la­tions with China.</p>
    <p>But it is just a slo­gan, and those who be­lieve in it of­ten court dis­as­ter. Just spare a thought for An­thony Eden, Britain’s prime min­is­ter dur­ing the 1950s, who went to war to re­gain con­trol over the Suez Canal in Egypt be­cause he be­lieved that Ga­mal Ab­del Nasser, the Egyp­tian leader then, was a new Hitler who should not be ap­peased. The com­par­i­son was stupid, the war was stupid, and the out­come was hu­mil­i­at­ing for Britain.</p>
    <p>And, fi­nally, there are his­tor­i­cal analo­gies which not only fail to com­pare like with like, but also ig­nore sce­nar­ios from the past which do of­fer hope­ful lessons to­day. That is the case with the cur­rent wave of claims that we are about to wit­ness a new Cold War be­tween China and the US.</p>
    <p>Again, the anal­ogy does not stand up. The first Cold War was con­ducted against the Soviet Union, which wished to keep it­self away from the West by in­vent­ing its own closed uni­verse, com­plete with its own mar­ket rules and in­ter­nal trade be­tween its satel­lites.</p>
    <p>It was there­fore easy to iso­late the USSR, be­cause the Soviet Union wanted to iso­late it­self. The Soviet Union was al­ways in­fe­rior to the West in ev­ery con­ceiv­able field, from tech­nol­ogy to hu­man re­sources, stan­dards of liv­ing or even size of its pop­u­la­tion. It was, as the cruel joke put it, “Up­per Volta with mis­siles”, a Third World na­tion with nu­clear weapons. The con­tain­ment of the Soviet Union was, there­fore, ef­fec­tive be­cause of the Soviet Union’s own mon­u­men­tal er­rors.</p>
    <p>To use the his­tor­i­cal analo­gies of con­tain­ment strate­gies in­vented for the first Cold War and to urge their ap­pli­ca­tion to a sup­posed sec­ond Cold War to­day – as peo­ple such as US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo seem to im­ply – is to de­lib­er­ately ob­fus­cate his­tory. Still, there are some lessons from the Cold War which are in­ter­est­ing, and can be put to good use to­day, such as the pe­riod of “de­tente”, of re­lax­ation in ten­sions be­tween the USSR and the US dur­ing the 1970s, when the two sworn en­e­mies proved that it was pos­si­ble to co­op­er­ate on key global is­sues not­with­stand­ing their ide­o­log­i­cal con­fronta­tion.</p>
    <p>DE­TENTE, ANY­ONE?</p>
    <p>None of this ap­plies to China, whose econ­omy is deeply in­ter­twined with the global econ­omy, a na­tion which is now com­pet­ing at ev­ery level of tech­nol­ogy with the US and is a su­per­power in ev­ery sense of the word.</p>
    <p>To use the his­tor­i­cal analo­gies of con­tain­ment strate­gies in­vented for the first Cold War and to urge their ap­pli­ca­tion to a sup­posed sec­ond Cold War to­day – as peo­ple such as US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo seem to im­ply – is to de­lib­er­ately ob­fus­cate his­tory.</p>
    <p>Still, there are some lessons from the Cold War which are in­ter­est­ing, and can be put to good use to­day, such as the pe­riod of “de­tente”, of re­lax­ation in ten­sions be­tween the USSR and the US dur­ing the 1970s, when the two sworn en­e­mies proved that it was pos­si­ble to co­op­er­ate on key global is­sues not­with­stand­ing their ide­o­log­i­cal con­fronta­tion.</p>
    <p>Sadly, none of those push­ing Cold War his­tor­i­cal analo­gies to­day care to look at th­ese more pos­i­tive or hope­ful an­gles.</p>
    <p>Be that as it may, his­tor­i­cal analo­gies are here to stay; Prof Yuen may be right to ar­gue that they ful­fil a par­tic­u­lar need in our own un­der­stand­ing of the world.</p>
    <p>But they should al­ways come with a warn­ing about their rel­e­vance.</p>
    <p>For ready-made his­toric analo­gies are sel­dom cor­rect, and never a sub­sti­tute for ef­forts to over­come to­day’s se­cu­rity chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>His­tory most cer­tainly does not equal des­tiny.</p>
