    <p>Should maids be al­lowed to work part-time?</p>
    <p>Even their em­ploy­ers can­not work part-time or moon­light un­der our em­ploy­ment con­tracts with our com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>If they work part-time, on week­days, they will be too tired to work, then our chil­dren and el­derly will be at their mercy.</p>
    <p>Mei Yen Low</p>
    <p>The full-time em­ployer has to bear all risks and hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion charges, should the maid get in­jured dur­ing the part-time job. Once you give in to this, more de­mands will come and the story never ends.</p>
    <p>Judy Lee</p>
    <p>I think the best ar­range­ment is to give these for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers a special pass. They look for their own place to stay, pay for their own meals, and are re­spon­si­ble for the levy and med­i­cal costs for them­selves.</p>
    <p>Then they can work part-time as much as they like. They plan their own work sched­ule.</p>
    <p>Dul­cet Melody</p>
    <p>This is not a good idea.</p>
    <p>Some of us al­ready have a lot of tasks that need to get done for one fam­ily for six days; the rest day is to give us some “me time”.</p>
    <p>Most helpers earn on av­er­age $600 to $900 a month, and it’s al­ready triple what we would earn if we work in our home town.</p>
    <p>If we man­age our bud­get wisely, I do be­lieve we can sur­vive.</p>
    <p>Desy Dey</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans should grow up and be like the rest of the de­vel­oped world, with­out an ad­dic­tion to cheap labour to im­prove their life­style. Hire a part-time cleaner or babysit­ter if you need one.</p>
    <p>John Wall</p>
    <p>If there is a way to pro­tect both the helper and their em­ploy­ers, then do a trial. Per­haps start with per­mit­ting the helper to do spe­cific chores for their em­ployer’s sib­lings or par­ents, and get paid a min­i­mum wage of, say, $15 an hour, work­ing only two days per week and lim­ited to two or three hours each day. A stan­dard con­tract needs to be en­forced.</p>
    <p>Mich Chan</p>
    <p>Yes, as long as the other hir­ing party is a known party to the ex­ist­ing em­ployer. If this is al­lowed, then the maid in­sur­ance pol­icy will need to cover this part, just like mo­tor in­sur­ance pol­icy re­quir­ing an­other named driver.</p>
    <p>Liang Mean Wong</p>
    <p>My mum’s helper is su­per hard-work­ing and she just amazes me with her cook­ing tal­ent. Not only that, she sells cloth­ing on­line too. If they can, they should be al­lowed to work part-time, with proper time man­age­ment.</p>
