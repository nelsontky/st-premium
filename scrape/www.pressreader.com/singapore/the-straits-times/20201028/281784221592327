    <p>A new joint task force, com­pris­ing union and in­dus­try rep­re­sen­ta­tives, will look into the em­ploy­a­bil­ity and up­skilling of pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers and ex­ec­u­tives (PMEs), par­tic­u­larly older ones, to help them stay rel­e­vant for the new econ­omy.</p>
    <p>An­nounc­ing this yes­ter­day, Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) sec­re­tary-gen­eral Ng Chee Meng said the group will also work with the Gov­ern­ment to re­view poli­cies im­pact­ing PMEs and con­duct re­search to gain insight into fu­ture trends, jobs and skills.</p>
    <p>Through th­ese en­gage­ments, it aims to pro­vide rec­om­men­da­tions on gov­ern­ment poli­cies and the best hu­man re­source prac­tices, and en­able PME train­ing by May 1 next year.</p>
    <p>Over the next six months, the task force will en­gage and in­volve PMEs and em­ploy­ers through a se­ries of polls, fo­cus group dis­cus­sions and events to iden­tify key con­cerns, needs and po­ten­tial skill gaps in the work­force, said Mr Ng.</p>
    <p>Co-led by NTUC as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Pa­trick Tay and Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion (SNEF) ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Sim Gim Guan, the task force com­prises union and in­dus­try rep­re­sen­ta­tives from the in­dus­trial, ser­vice and pub­lic sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng and SNEF pres­i­dent Robert Yap will be its ad­vis­ers.</p>
    <p>A press state­ment on the task force said it will fo­cus on the pro­tec­tion and en­able­ment of PMEs in three key ar­eas:</p>
    <p>En­hance the em­ploy­a­bil­ity of PMEs and re­duce the risk of re­trench­ment;</p>
    <p>En­cour­age em­ploy­ers to re­tain and build ca­pa­bil­i­ties for work­force and busi­ness trans­for­ma­tions, as well as eco­nomic re­cov­ery; and</p>
    <p>En­able PMEs through up­skilling and reskilling to en­hance their em­ploy­a­bil­ity. Dur­ing a key­note speech at the Labour Re­search Con­fer­ence 2020 yes­ter­day, Mr Ng noted that PMEs, es­pe­cially those aged be­tween 40 and 60, are more vul­ner­a­ble due to eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion and tech­no­log­i­cal dis­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>He said NTUC will look at how to bet­ter rep­re­sent ma­ture PMEs in the work­place and equip them with skills to se­cure jobs amid the chal­lenges fac­ing the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“Ul­ti­mately, we want to strengthen our PMEs’ em­ploy­a­bil­ity and build a skilled work­force with a strong Sin­ga­porean core,” added Mr Ng.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay, a labour MP, said the re­ces­sion has had a great im­pact on lo­cal PMEs and the sit­u­a­tion is likely to worsen as the Sin­ga­pore econ­omy con­tin­ues to ex­pe­ri­ence the rip­ple ef­fects of the Covid-19 pan­demic. “Against this back­drop, we need to en­sure our PMEs are ad­e­quately pro­tected, have ac­cess to good jobs and are equipped with rel­e­vant skills, so they can thrive in this new nor­mal,” said Mr Tay.</p>
    <p>Data from the Min­istry of Man­power shows that pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians made up half the num­ber of lo­cal re­trench­ment cases in the sec­ond quar­ter of this year. This group also ex­pe­ri­enced a slower re-em­ploy­ment rate within six months of be­ing re­trenched.</p>
