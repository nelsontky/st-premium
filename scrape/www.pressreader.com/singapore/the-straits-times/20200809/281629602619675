    <p>Two weeks ago, For­est Darts Cafe raised the shut­ters on its Down­town East and An­son Road out­lets af­ter a four-month hia­tus.</p>
    <p>The darts and karaoke bar chain be­came the first mem­ber of the 120-strong Sin­ga­pore En­ter­tain­ment Af­fil­i­a­tion to re­sume oper­a­tions af­ter two of its five out­lets re­opened as eater­ies.</p>
    <p>But the ap­proval process was oner­ous and costly, and with­out the star at­trac­tions, few cus­tomers have re­turned, said co-owner Lena Si­too.</p>
    <p>Thus is the quandary faced by the re­main­ing karaoke op­er­a­tors that make up the af­fil­i­a­tion, its chair­man Ron­ald Ng noted.</p>
    <p>While a num­ber of pub­lic en­ter­tain­ment out­lets, in­clud­ing amuse­ment cen­tres and pool halls, have been al­lowed to re­open in re­cent weeks, karaoke ac­tiv­i­ties re­main pro­hib­ited.</p>
    <p>This is due to the higher risk of coro­n­avirus trans­mis­sion that singing presents, par­tic­u­larly in en­closed spa­ces.</p>
    <p>For Ms Si­too, the process of re­open­ing her Down­town East out­let took sev­eral weeks and cost $730 in ap­pli­ca­tion and li­cence fees.</p>
    <p>This en­tailed ap­ply­ing to the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity to add the word “cafe” to her premises’ stated use, ob­tain­ing an ap­proval let­ter from her land­lord and ap­ply­ing to the Sin­ga­pore Food Agency to change the out­let’s food shop li­cence clas­si­fi­ca­tion from bar and pub to snack bar.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, it may con­tinue to serve light bites and bev­er­ages as long as the elec­tronic darts and karaoke ma­chines re­mained pow­ered down – some­thing that could have been done from the start, Ms Si­too, 52, pointed out. For­est Darts Cafe’s An­son Road out­let has an ex­ist­ing snack bar li­cence.</p>
    <p>Un­der the cur­rent rules, those with restau­rant or snack bar li­cences may con­tinue to op­er­ate if they stop of­fer­ing pub­lic en­ter­tain­ment. Those with karaoke lounge, bar and pub li­cences, how­ever, may not op­er­ate.</p>
    <p>“A lot of bars are al­lowed to open just be­cause they serve food. Those of us with­out kitchens can fol­low the same safe man­age­ment mea­sures, so I don’t un­der­stand why we can’t op­er­ate,” said Ms Si­too.</p>
    <p>The ab­sence of any in­di­ca­tion as to when the in­dus­try may re­sume is a ma­jor worry as wage and rental sub­si­dies draw to an end.</p>
    <p>“If we at least have an es­ti­mate, we can plan,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng said many karaoke op­er­a­tors face space con­straints and other chal­lenges in piv­ot­ing their busi­nesses and meet­ing new li­cens­ing re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>“About 70 per cent of the in­dus­try is pubs and bars, and it would help if they waived the change of use re­quire­ment and let us open with­out the singing. A lot of land­lords are chas­ing for rental this month in full; we can­not sleep be­cause it’s so stress­ful,” he said.</p>
    <p>Last month, pop­u­lar karaoke chain Teo Heng said it may soon be forced to close half of its 14 out­lets due to the im­pact of the clo­sures.</p>
    <p>Karaoke Times co-founder Si­mon Sim said he hired a new em­ployee for his year-old fam­ily karaoke busi­ness in City Square Mall in March, but had to let her go with com­pen­sa­tion a month later as he could not af­ford to keep her on.</p>
    <p>Mr Sim, 47, has been re­ly­ing on sav­ings to sup­port his fam­ily over the last four months and is con­sid­er­ing giv­ing up the busi­ness.</p>
    <p>But with two years left on the lease con­tract, walk­ing away is no sim­ple propo­si­tion. “If you give up the unit, man­age­ment will ask you to get an­other ten­ant and if can­not, you for­feit your de­posit. On top of that, you might be sued for the re­main­ing con­tract and you still need to re­in­state the shop,” he said.</p>
    <p>If no fur­ther gov­ern­ment sup­port is forth­com­ing, busi­nesses will need help un­wind­ing from such con­tracts, said Mr Ng.</p>
    <p>“At least then, op­er­a­tors think­ing of clos­ing can close with­out li­a­bil­i­ties.”</p>
