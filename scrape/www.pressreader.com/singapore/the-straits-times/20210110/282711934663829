    <p>With Covid-19 bring­ing in­ter­na­tional and lo­cal events – in­clud­ing the Na­tional School Games – to a halt last year, the Singapore Olympic Foun­da­tion (SOF)-Peter Lim Schol­ar­ship will be giv­ing out “en­cour­ag­ing awards” this year in­stead of schol­ar­ships.</p>
    <p>The SOF said in a press state­ment yes­ter­day that the dis­rup­tion caused by the pan­demic has af­fected the schol­ar­ship’s se­lec­tion cri­te­ria, as achieve­ments at th­ese com­pe­ti­tions would usu­ally de­ter­mine the el­i­gi­bil­ity of the ap­pli­cants.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the foun­da­tion’s “en­cour­ag­ing awards” will look at al­ter­na­tive qual­i­fi­ca­tion cri­te­ria in its ef­fort to con­tinue to sup­port as­pir­ing stu­dent-ath­letes and to ben­e­fit those from fi­nan­cially chal­lenged back­grounds.</p>
    <p>The cri­te­ria will be largely based on the ap­pli­cant’s house­hold in­come and a nom­i­nal ac­tiv­ity in his or her sport. This means “good per­for­mance at in­ter-school (min­i­mal zonal level) or equiv­a­lent com­pe­ti­tion(s)” for those in the pri­mary, sec­ondary, or ter­tiary cat­e­gories in­clud­ing ju­nior col­leges and in­te­grated pro­grammes, said the state­ment.</p>
    <p>Ng Ser Miang, chair­man of the SOF said: “The val­ues we hold in sport will tide us through th­ese chal­leng­ing times and con­tinue to help us to forge ahead, as we fight against the pan­demic and be poised for re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>“It is the de­sire of the SOF and Mr Peter Lim to con­tinue to en­cour­age and sup­port young stu­dent-ath­letes, es­pe­cially those from chal­lenged back­grounds.</p>
    <p>“With the re­vised cri­te­ria this year, we hope to reach as many el­i­gi­ble stu­dent-ath­letes as pos­si­ble and, at the same time, con­tinue to sup­port their sport­ing as­pi­ra­tions.”</p>
    <p>The money awarded to each ath­lete will be re­duced so that more re­cip­i­ents can qual­ify, said the state­ment. A to­tal of $825,000 was dis­bursed to 289 ath­letes last year across the four cat­e­gories: pri­mary ($1,000), sec­ondary ($2,000), ju­nior col­lege/in­te­grated pro­gramme/ter­tiary ($3,000) and high per­for­mance Un­der-18 ($5,000). That quan­tum has dipped by be­tween 50 and 75 per cent this year to $250, $500, $1,000 and $2,500 re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Es­tab­lished in June 2010, the schol­ar­ship has handed out $8 mil­lion to 2,930 stu­dent-ath­letes in 54 sports.</p>
    <p>In July 2019, Sin­ga­porean busi­ness­man Lim pledged another $10 mil­lion to fund the schol­ar­ship un­til 2030. In­ter­ested ap­pli­cants can ap­ply for the award at sof.sg from to­mor­row till Feb 10, 4pm.</p>
