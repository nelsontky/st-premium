    <p>• Big Hit En­ter­tain­ment, the man­age­ment agency of South Korean K-pop group BTS, saw its stock fall as much as 23 per cent last Fri­day, ex­tend­ing losses from its de­but the pre­vi­ous day as pric­ing eased af­ter pre-list­ing hype.</p>
    <p>The stock had dipped from its de­but price ahead of last Thurs­day’s clos­ing, with an­a­lysts say­ing the lower price should be viewed as more rea­son­able, based on the fun­da­men­tals of a com­pany which re­lies heav­ily on a sin­gle boy band for rev­enue.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts said Big Hit’s val­u­a­tion, based on its ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO) price of 135,000 won (S$160) per share, was com­pa­ra­ble to peers such as K-pop agen­cies SM En­ter­tain­ment and JYP En­ter­tain­ment.</p>
    <p>They said the price, which fell as low as 199,000 won last Fri­day, seemed to be re­turn­ing to earth af­ter a pe­riod of over­heated spec­u­la­tion pushed Big Hit’s de­but to dou­ble the IPO price and then fu­elled a fur­ther 30 per cent surge shortly af­ter.</p>
    <p>The short-lived surge echoed the strong de­buts of SK Bio­phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals in July and Kakao Games last month, as South Korean re­tail in­vestors known as “ants” cap­i­talise on gov­ern­ment eco­nomic stim­u­lus pro­grammes which have flooded mar­kets with cash.</p>
    <p>How­ever, un­like a phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal maker with a pipe­line of drugs or a mo­bile game de­vel­oper ben­e­fit­ing from a stay-at-home trend, K-pop agen­cies that de­pend only on a few star artists can see more fluc­tu­a­tion in share prices, an­a­lysts said.</p>
    <p>BTS ac­counted for 97.4 per cent of Big Hit’s rev­enue last year and 87.7 per cent in the first half of this year, a reg­u­la­tory fil­ing showed.</p>
    <p>“Big Hit’s re­liance on BTS is still ab­so­lute when in­clud­ing non­man­age­ment, indi­rect sales such as mer­chan­dise, in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty and con­tent,” said Hyundai Mo­tor Se­cu­ri­ties an­a­lyst Kim Hyun-yong.</p>
    <p>“It must make all-out ef­forts to cre­ate a post-BTS rev­enue source.”</p>
