    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Vir­gin At­lantic Air­ways has be­come bil­lion­aire Richard Branson’s sec­ond air­line to file for Chap­ter 15 bank­ruptcy in the United States this year.</p>
    <p>Chap­ter 15 al­lows for­eign com­pa­nies with US as­sets to pro­tect them­selves against claims, while they work on a turn­around plan at home.</p>
    <p>Vir­gin Aus­tralia also sought pro­tec­tion af­ter fil­ing for vol­un­tary ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Vir­gin At­lantic had said dur­ing pro­ceed­ings in Bri­tain that it planned to ap­ply for the US pro­tec­tion, while it fi­nalises a res­cue plan that is al­ready sup­ported by a ma­jor­ity of its stake­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Vir­gin At­lantic is seek­ing to se­cure a £1.2 bil­lion (S$2.2 bil­lion) res­cue, which was an­nounced last month.</p>
    <p>“The process we have asked to be recog­nised is a sol­vent re­struc­tur­ing of an English com­pany,” a Vir­gin At­lantic spokesman said of the Chap­ter 15 fil­ing.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish process is pro­ceed­ing with the sup­port of a ma­jor­ity of its cred­i­tors, the com­pany said.</p>
    <p>The air­line, 51 per cent owned by Mr Branson’s Vir­gin Group and 49 per cent by US air­line Delta, closed its Gatwick base and cut more than 3,500 jobs to con­tend with the fall­out from the pan­demic, which has grounded planes and cut de­mand for air travel. Air­lines glob­ally are un­der pres­sure.</p>
    <p>Three of Latin Amer­ica’s big­gest – Latam Air­lines Group, Avianca Hold­ings and Grupo Aeromex­ico – are re­or­gan­is­ing in bank­ruptcy court in New York.</p>
    <p>At least four US re­gional air­lines have col­lapsed and rev­enue at car­ri­ers with vast in­ter­na­tional net­works could see sales plunge 66 per cent this year, ac­cord­ing to a Bloomberg In­tel­li­gence re­port.</p>
    <p>Since Jan 1, Vir­gin At­lantic’s reser­va­tions are down 89 per cent year on year, and de­mand for the sec­ond half of this year is at ap­prox­i­mately 25 per cent of last year’s lev­els, ac­cord­ing to court pa­pers.</p>
    <p>Vir­gin At­lantic’s re­struc­tur­ing plan in Bri­tain de­pends on the ap­proval of its Chap­ter 15 fil­ing in the US, the com­pany said in its fil­ing.</p>
    <p>With­out the plan, there is un­cer­tainty as to whether Vir­gin At­lantic could get enough cred­i­tor sup­port to im­ple­ment its re­struc­tur­ing in time to avoid go­ing into for­mal in­sol­vency pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>Delta said it sup­ported the plan and was “op­ti­mistic” that it would help Vir­gin At­lantic “main­tain its po­si­tion” in the travel mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Vir­gin At­lantic said it needed to re­cap­i­talise “to not only sur­vive the ex­i­gent threats posed by the Covid-19 global pan­demic, but to thrive once the im­me­di­ate global health cri­sis passes”.</p>
    <p>The high-pro­file Mr Branson had at­tracted crit­i­cism af­ter call­ing for gov­ern­ment help for Vir­gin At­lantic to sur­vive the down­turn.</p>
