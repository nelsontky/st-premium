    <p>Man­u­fac­tur­ing firms and work­ers will get more help in pre­par­ing for the fac­tory of the fu­ture, with a new pro­gramme de­vel­oped by Ger­man gi­ant Bosch, which aims to train about 1,500 work­ers and sup­port 300 com­pa­nies in the next five years. Its In­dus­try 4.0 train­ing pro­gramme was launched here yesterday.</p>
    <p>Man­u­fac­tur­ing firms and work­ers will get more help in pre­par­ing for the fac­tory of the fu­ture, with a new pro­gramme de­vel­oped by Ger­man gi­ant Bosch, which aims to train about 1,500 work­ers and sup­port 300 com­pa­nies in the next five years.</p>
    <p>Its In­dus­try 4.0 train­ing pro­gramme was launched here yesterday, through the Bosch Rexroth Re­gional Train­ing Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The con­glom­er­ate is work­ing with Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic to pro­duce bite-size mod­ules to help man­u­fac­tur­ers to trans­form.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, a longer spe­cial­ist course will be rolled out in the first quar­ter of next year, in part­ner­ship with the Sin­ga­porean-Ger­man Cham­ber of In­dus­try and Com­merce.</p>
    <p>This will in­clude five mod­ules, to­talling more than 104 hours, cov­er­ing such ar­eas as busi­ness models in pro­duc­tion and lo­gis­tics.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies can also carry out proof-of-con­cept projects, in which they bring a prob­lem state­ment to the train­ing ses­sion and ap­ply the tech­nolo­gies they learn to find so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Ed­u­ca­tion as well as Trade and In­dus­try Chee Hong Tat said, on a visit to Bosch yesterday, that in the next stage of Skill­sFu­ture, the en­ter­prise pil­lar will be very cru­cial, “be­cause we need to work closely with our in­dus­try part­ners to de­velop stronger ca­pa­bil­i­ties and deepen the skills of our work­force”.</p>
    <p>This close part­ner­ship will also help “to tai­lor some of the pro­grammes to bet­ter fit what the com­pa­nies will look for sub­se­quently when they gen­er­ate jobs and look for growth op­por­tu­ni­ties”.</p>
    <p>He also said one way to spur train­ing and trans­for­ma­tion is to col­lab­o­rate with “queen bee” firms like Bosch Rexroth, a Bosch sub­sidiary that pro­vides in­dus­try so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>There are now 17 queen bee com­pa­nies, which are in­dus­try lead­ers iden­ti­fied by Skill­sFu­ture. They in­clude lo­cal com­pa­nies such as United Over­seas Bank and en­ergy com­pany SP Group.</p>
    <p>Mr Chee said the goal is to have 40 such com­pa­nies in the next five years.</p>
    <p>The first train­ing ses­sion was con­ducted at the Bosch South-east Asia head­quar­ters, sited in Bis­han.</p>
    <p>Sub­se­quent ses­sions will be held at Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic un­til the Bosch Rexroth Re­gional Train­ing Cen­tre, at Jurong In­no­va­tion Dis­trict, is ready early next year.</p>
    <p>The move to trans­form com­pa­nies will help to grow Sin­ga­pore’s man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties, es­pe­cially since it is un­able to com­pete on cost, Mr Chee noted.</p>
    <p>“It is about what kind of man­u­fac­tur­ing and... how we es­tab­lish the net­works with the sup­ply chains and the value chains in the re­gion. And (most) im­por­tantly, it is how we use technology and de­sign to help us be­come more pro­duc­tive and more com­pet­i­tive.”</p>
    <p>Mr Roland Keller, pres­i­dent of Bosch Rexroth in Asean and Ocea­nia, said: “The new In­dus­try 4.0 spe­cial­ist qual­i­fi­ca­tion opens up new job op­por­tu­ni­ties, com­pe­ten­cies and at­trac­tive­ness, which fur­ther so­lid­i­fies Sin­ga­pore’s com­pet­i­tive edge as a strong man­u­fac­tur­ing base and pre­ferred in­vest­ment des­ti­na­tion in the re­gion.”</p>
    <p>One trainee at the Bosch class is Mr Goh Chye Lim, who was last em­ployed as a mecha­tron­ics and robotics en­gi­neer.</p>
    <p>Said the 53-year-old: “I no­ticed, after a few failed in­ter­views, that I have knowl­edge gaps in soft­ware and technology.”</p>
    <p>He said he had not only learnt soft­ware skills and pro­gram­ming, but also re­ceived hands-on train­ing in con­cepts like the In­ter­net of Things.</p>
    <p>IN­CREAS­ING CA­PA­BIL­I­TIES</p>
    <p>It is about what kind of man­u­fac­tur­ing and ... how we es­tab­lish the net­works with the sup­ply chains and the value chains in the re­gion. And (most) im­por­tantly, it is how we use technology and de­sign to help us be­come more pro­duc­tive and more com­pet­i­tive.</p>
