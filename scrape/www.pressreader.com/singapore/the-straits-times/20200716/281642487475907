    <p>last more than two weeks. Af­ter that, I’m pen­ni­less un­til the set­tle­ment comes in and who knows when that will be,” she said, adding it would be dif­fi­cult at her age to find re-em­ploy­ment in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, other em­ploy­ees said they had some sav­ings, but would also strug­gle to find em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>“I have a very lim­ited skill set, and now that en­ter­tain­ment venues aren’t well pa­tro­n­ised, I don’t know what I will do,” said a Malaysian waiter and bar staff mem­ber in his late 30s, who gave his name only as Mr Toh.</p>
    <p>Casino deal­ers were also not ex­empt from the re­trench­ment ex­er­cise. A Malaysian croupier in his 40s named An­drew told ST he had “seen this com­ing”, but still was not fi­nan­cially pre­pared to lose his job on such short no­tice.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think any­one wakes up and pre­pares to get fired that day, but we had heard (talk) in our chat groups that this was go­ing to hap­pen,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that he and his col­leagues no­ticed that the ma­jor­ity of those be­ing called up seemed to be for­eign­ers and work pass hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ees at RWS and t he ad­ja­cent Uni­ver­sal Stu­dios Sin­ga­pore who man­aged to keep their jobs told ST they, too, were fear­ful that the dras­tic cuts would even­tu­ally be ex­tended to them.</p>
    <p>“It is hard not to worry af­ter see­ing so many col­leagues get re­trenched at one go,” said a Sin­ga­porean em­ployee at RWS’ front of house who de­clined to be named.</p>
    <p>The man in his 40s ex­pected that work­ers who es­caped the job cuts would be asked to take on more du­ties or work more shifts, but hopes that the staff will be com­pen­sated ap­pro­pri­ately.</p>
    <p>“With so many peo­ple gone, some­one will have to pick up the slack,” agreed another Sin­ga­porean worker in his 30s at one of the ho­tels’ food and bev­er­age es­tab­lish­ments who did not want to be named. “Of course, hav­ing more work to do is way bet­ter than the thought of los­ing my job.”</p>
