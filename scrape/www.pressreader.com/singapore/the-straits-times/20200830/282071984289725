    <p>NEW YORK • Frus­trated by what they view as a lack of lever­age in men’s ten­nis, top-ranked No­vak Djokovic and Vasek Pospisil are form­ing a break­away body to rep­re­sent the in­ter­ests of play­ers out­side of the cur­rent struc­ture of the ATP Tour. They have also re­signed their lead­er­ship roles in the as­so­ci­a­tion’s player coun­cil.</p>
    <p>Canada’s Pospisil, who is ranked 92nd, an­nounced his res­ig­na­tion on Twit­ter on Friday night, say­ing that within the cur­rent struc­ture of the men’s tour, “it is very dif­fi­cult, if not im­pos­si­ble, to have any sig­nif­i­cant im­pact on any ma­jor de­ci­sions made by our tour”.</p>
    <p>Djokovic, the pres­i­dent of the player coun­cil, and John Is­ner, the high­est-ranked Amer­i­can men’s player at 21, also re­signed from their po­si­tions, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with their de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>The peo­ple spoke on con­di­tion of anonymity be­cause the res­ig­na­tions had not been made pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Many de­tails about the new group re­main vague be­yond its name, the Pro­fes­sional Ten­nis Play­ers As­so­ci­a­tion (PTPA), and its in­ten­tion to rep­re­sent men’s sin­gles play­ers in the top 500 and dou­bles play­ers in the top 200.</p>
    <p>It is not clear, for ex­am­ple, if its goal would be to bar­gain col­lec­tively like play­ers unions in other pro­fes­sional sports.</p>
    <p>Un­like in the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion, for ex­am­ple, ten­nis play­ers are in­de­pen­dent con­trac­tors. But it is clear that the ATP sees the up­start ef­fort as a threat, urg­ing play­ers not to sup­port it.</p>
    <p>Seven­teen-time Grand Slam win­ner Djokovic and Pospisil de­tailed the plans in a doc­u­ment they dis­trib­uted to other play­ers, which was seen by The New York Times. In it, they ar­gue an au­ton­o­mous body for play­ers is nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>The ATP, founded 30 years ago, rep­re­sents play­ers and tour­na­ments jointly, with both sides hav­ing seats on the gov­ern­ing board for de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>“The goal of the PTPA is not to re­place the ATP, but to pro­vide play­ers with a self-gov­er­nance struc­ture that is in­de­pen­dent from the</p>
    <p>ATP and is di­rectly re­spon­sive to player-mem­bers’ needs and con­cerns,” the play­ers said in the doc­u­ment so­lic­it­ing sign-ups from other top play­ers on the tour.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther Pospisil, Is­ner, Djokovic nor An­drea Gau­denzi, the ATP chair, re­sponded to re­quests for com­ment. How­ever, in a let­ter to play­ers ob­tained by the Times, the Ital­ian has urged the play­ers “not to take lightly” the ram­i­fi­ca­tions of starting a new as­so­ci­a­tion while ac­knowl­edg­ing that “no or­gan­i­sa­tional struc­ture is per­fect”.</p>
