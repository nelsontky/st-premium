    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX) yes­ter­day posed queries to Bi­o­lidics about a li­cence agree­ment the Catal­ist-listed firm had inked, as well as the tim­ing of its trading halt and an­nounce­ment.</p>
    <p>In a fil­ing on Tues­day night, Bi­o­lidics said it had on July 9 en­tered into a five-year li­cence agree­ment with Ac­cel­er­ate Tech­nolo­gies, the com­mer­cial­i­sa­tion arm of the Agency for Science, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search (A*Star), to use the agency’s tech­nol­ogy for the de­tec­tion of Covid-19 vi­ral spike/an­giotensin con­vert­ing en­zyme 2 (ACE2) block­ing an­ti­bod­ies.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore-based can­cer di­ag­nos­tics firm added that it was aim­ing to de­velop new serol­ogy tests which in­cor­po­rate the tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Shares of the Covid-19 test-kit maker jumped 29.3 per cent on Mon­day be­fore it called for a trading halt at 12.19pm. It then re­leased the A*Star an­nounce­ment on Tues­day at 10.46pm, be­fore lift­ing the halt on Wed­nes­day morn­ing ahead of the mar­ket’s open­ing bell.</p>
    <p>SGX asked Bi­o­lidics to pro­vide rea­sons for the de­lay in an­nounc­ing the agree­ment, see­ing as it was signed sev­eral days ago, and whether its spon­sor was aware and con­sulted on the dis­clo­sure of the mat­ter, and what ad­vice the spon­sor gave. The bourse op­er­a­tor also asked when Bi­o­lidics’ board and spon­sor had ap­proved the an­nounce­ment.</p>
    <p>Un­der the five-year li­cence pact, Ac­cel­er­ate Tech­nolo­gies is grant­ing Bi­o­lidics non-ex­clu­sive world­wide rights to the tech­nol­ogy for di­ag­nos­tic use, to fur­ther de­velop the tech­nol­ogy and to mar­ket new serol­ogy tests that in­cor­po­rate the tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>SGX asked Bi­o­lidics whether it pro­vided any con­sid­er­a­tion or out­lay for be­ing granted these rights to use A*Star’s tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Bi­o­lidics is also re­quired to dis­close the rights as­sign­ment for the prod­ucts and tech­nolo­gies that it will sub­se­quently de­velop us­ing the tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>“Are there any dif­fer­ences be­tween how these rights are as­signed dur­ing and af­ter the (five-year) term? Does Bi­o­lidics have ex­clu­sive rights to the said prod­ucts or tech­nolo­gies?” SGX added.</p>
    <p>As for Bi­o­lidics’ in­ten­tion to fur­ther de­velop the tech­nol­ogy, the bourse op­er­a­tor re­quested the pro­jected time­line or mile­stone, if any.</p>
    <p>SGX also asked whether there were con­di­tions to be met be­fore Bi­o­lidics can mar­ket the serol­ogy tests that in­cor­po­rate the tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Lastly, Bi­o­lidics is re­quired to dis­close when it ex­pects to be able to mar­ket the serol­ogy tests that in­cor­po­rate the tech­nol­ogy, as well as how far along the com­pany is in suc­cess­fully in­cor­po­rat­ing the tech­nol­ogy into its Covid-19 an­ti­body test kit or any other form of serol­ogy tests.</p>
    <p>Bi­o­lidics must file its re­sponse by to­day.</p>
