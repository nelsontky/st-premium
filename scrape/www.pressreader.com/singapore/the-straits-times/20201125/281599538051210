    <p>HAINAN • China has hailed as a suc­cess its pre-dawn launch yes­ter­day of a robotic space­craft to bring back rocks from the Moon in the first at­tempt by any coun­try to re­trieve lu­nar sur­face sam­ples since the 1970s, a mis­sion un­der­scor­ing Chi­nese am­bi­tions in space.</p>
    <p>The Long March-5, China’s largest car­rier rocket, blasted off at 4.30am Sin­ga­pore time from Wenchang Space Launch Cen­tre on the south­ern Chi­nese is­land of Hainan car­ry­ing the Chang’e-5 space­craft.</p>
    <p>The China Na­tional Space Ad­min­is­tra­tion (CNSA) called the launch a suc­cess and said in a state­ment that the rocket flew for nearly 37 min­utes be­fore send­ing the space­craft on its in­tended tra­jec­tory.</p>
    <p>The mis­sion by the Chang’e-5, named af­ter the an­cient Chi­nese Moon god­dess, will seek to col­lect lu­nar ma­te­rial to help sci­en­tists un­der­stand more about the Moon’s ori­gins and for­ma­tion. The mis­sion will test China’s abil­ity to re­motely ac­quire sam­ples from space, ahead of more com­plex mis­sions.</p>
    <p>State broad­caster CCTV, which ran live cov­er­age of the launch, showed images of CNSA staff ap­plaud­ing and cheer­ing as they watched the space­craft climb­ing through the at­mos­phere, light­ing up the night sky.</p>
    <p>If the mis­sion is com­pleted as planned, it would make China only the third coun­try to have re­trieved lu­nar sam­ples, join­ing the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
    <p>Upon en­ter­ing the Moon’s or­bit, the space­craft is ex­pected to de­ploy a pair of ve­hi­cles to the lu­nar sur­face: a lan­der and an as­cen­der.</p>
    <p>The land­ing is due to take place in about eight days, ac­cord­ing to Mr Pei Zhaoyu, a spokesman for the mis­sion. The probe is due to re­main on the lu­nar sur­face for about two days, while the en­tire mis­sion is sched­uled to take an es­ti­mated 23 days, he said.</p>
    <p>The plan is for the lan­der to drill into the lu­nar sur­face, with a robotic arm scoop­ing out soil and rocks. This ma­te­rial would be trans­ferred to the as­cen­der ve­hi­cle, which is due to carry it from the sur­face and then dock with an or­bit­ing mod­ule.</p>
    <p>The sam­ples then would be trans­ferred to a re­turn cap­sule for the re­turn trip to Earth, with a land­ing in China’s In­ner Mon­go­lia re­gion.</p>
    <p>“The big­gest chal­lenges... are the sam­pling work on the lu­nar sur­face, take-off from the lu­nar sur­face, ren­dezvous and dock­ing in the lu­nar or­bit, and high-speed reen­try to Earth,” said Mr Pei, who is also direc­tor of the space ad­min­is­tra­tion’s Lu­nar Ex­plo­ration and Space En­gi­neer­ing Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>China, which last year car­ried out the first land­ing on the far side of the Moon and in July of this year launched a robotic probe to Mars, has other space goals in its sights.</p>
    <p>It aims to have a per­ma­nent manned space sta­tion in ser­vice around 2022.</p>
    <p>“From next year, we will carry out the launch mis­sion of our na­tional space sta­tion,” said the Long March-5 car­rier rocket’s deputy com­man­der Qu Yiguang.</p>
    <p>Dr Matt Siegler, a re­search sci­en­tist at the Ari­zona-based Plan­e­tary Sci­ence In­sti­tute who is not part of the Chang’e-5 mis­sion, said the Mons Rumker vol­canic area of the Moon where the space­craft is due to land is be­tween one bil­lion and two bil­lion years old.</p>
    <p>“That is very young for the Moon – most of our sam­ples are 31/ bil</p>
    <p>2 lion years old or more,” Dr Siegler said in an e-mail, not­ing that the area and other sim­i­lar ones rep­re­sented “late-stage vol­can­ism” when the Moon had enough in­ter­nal heat for such ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>“We want to find out what is spe­cial about these re­gions and why they re­mained warm longer than the rest of the Moon,” Dr Siegler added.</p>
