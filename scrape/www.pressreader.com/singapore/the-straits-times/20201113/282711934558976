    <p>• The tit­u­lar char­ac­ters in Peter Pan and Al­ice In Won­der­land are brother and sis­ter in the new fan­tasy film, Come Away, that puts a new spin on two of the best-known Bri­tish chil­dren’s clas­sic sto­ries.</p>
    <p>And that is not all.</p>
    <p>Both Peter and Al­ice are played by young, mul­tira­cial ac­tors, with ac­tor David Oyelowo, 44, play­ing their fa­ther and ac­tress An­gelina Jolie, 45, play­ing their mother in turn-of-the-20th-cen­tury Eng­land.</p>
    <p>“They are iconic char­ac­ters in beloved fairy tales, but we’ve never seen them put to­gether,” said Oyelowo, best known for play­ing Amer­i­can civil rights ac­tivist Martin Luther King Jr in Selma (2014).</p>
    <p>“These are fic­tional fan­tasy char­ac­ters that race is not some­thing that is tied to their rep­re­sen­ta­tion on film,” he added.</p>
    <p>“I think there are far more peo­ple who are go­ing to cel­e­brate what we do in this film than the few and small voices who take um­brage at it.”</p>
    <p>Come Away is re­leased in Amer­i­can movie the­atres to­day and in Bri­tain on Dec 4.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can direc­tor Brenda Chap­man said she was ini­tially look­ing to cast a white man in the role un­til Oyelowo’s name came up.</p>
    <p>“This is some­thing new. And it opens up the world to so many more peo­ple (by mak­ing) these char­ac­ters more re­lat­able,” said Chap­man, 58, who de­scribed her­self as a mid­dle-aged white woman.</p>
    <p>Ac­tress Keira Chansa said the chance to play the young Al­ice was re­fresh­ing.</p>
    <p>“I’ve al­ways watched the films and read the books, and it was al­ways a white girl,” she said.</p>
    <p>“So to be able to ex­pe­ri­ence it, to be some­body who looks like me, is a big change in the world and makes a big dif­fer­ence.”</p>
