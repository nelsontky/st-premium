    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysia has ar­rested a Bangladesh­i na­tional who crit­i­cised the gov­ern­ment over its treat­ment of mi­grant work­ers in a re­port by broad­caster Al Jazeera, the gov­ern­ment said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The July 3 re­port on Malaysia’s treat­ment of un­doc­u­mented for­eign work­ers dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic sparked a back­lash in the South-east Asia na­tion, with sev­eral of­fi­cials de­scrib­ing it as be­ing in­ac­cu­rate, mis­lead­ing and un­fair.</p>
    <p>Rights groups have ac­cused the gov­ern­ment of sup­press­ing me­dia free­dom af­ter po­lice called in Al</p>
    <p>Zoom meet­ings, What­sApp calls and self­ies of each fam­ily at home, wear­ing masks and hold­ing ban­ners: This is how farm­ers in In­dia who gave up their land for the cap­i­tal city of Amar­a­vati are now protest­ing against its can­cel­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“We have been protest­ing since the gov­ern­ment de­cided to shift the cap­i­tal and throw us into un­cer­tainty. July 23 was our 220th day of ag­i­ta­tion,” said Mr Cha­la­p­ati Rao, a well-to-do farmer whose fam­ily gave 30ha to­wards the build­ing of the new cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>The southern state of Andhra Pradesh was plan­ning to build Amar­a­vati, a high-tech cap­i­tal city, out of 29 fer­tile river­side vil­lages. Sin­ga­pore com­pa­nies were draw­ing up the mas­ter­plan. Thou­sands of farm­ers con­trib­uted their land for the project, while some re­fused.</p>
    <p>But Chief Min­is­ter Y. S. Ja­gan Mo­han Reddy, who was elected last year, can­celled the project, say­ing it was too am­bi­tious and un­nec­es­sar­ily ex­pen­sive for a state neck-deep</p>
    <p>Jazeera jour­nal­ists for ques­tion­ing.</p>
    <p>An ar­rest war­rant was is­sued for Mr Md Ray­han Kabir, the Bangladesh­i worker quoted in the news re­port as say­ing the gov­ern­ment dis­crim­i­nated against un­doc­u­mented for­eign work­ers by ar­rest­ing and jail­ing them dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Ray­han was ar­rested on Fri­day and will be ex­pelled from the coun­try, Datuk Khairul Dza­imee Daud, Malaysia’s di­rec­tor-gen­eral in debt. Last Novem­ber, the state mu­tu­ally agreed to ter­mi­nate a con­tract with a con­sor­tium of Sin­ga­pore real es­tate com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Dis­cus­sions over the lo­ca­tion of the cap­i­tal have been go­ing on since 2015, when Andhra Pradesh was di­vided into two – Te­lan­gana and Andhra Pradesh. They were to share Hy­der­abad city as their cap­i­tal un­til a new one was found.</p>
    <p>Last Dec 17, Mr Reddy an­nounced that he would cre­ate three cap­i­tals: the coastal city of Visakha­p­at­nam is set to be the ex­ec­u­tive cap­i­tal, with ad­min­is­tra­tive of­fices; Kurnool will be the ju­di­cial cap­i­tal, with courts; and Amar­a­vati will be the leg­isla­tive cap­i­tal, with the assem­bly and sec­re­tar­iat.</p>
    <p>Mr Reddy said this would en­sure de­cen­tralised de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Since then, the Amar­a­vati Farm­ers United Coun­cil, rep­re­sent­ing about 24,000 farm­ers of the cap­i­tal re­gion, has been on the warpath. It has led protest marches and ral­lies against the three-city plan.</p>
    <p>“We de­mand that the gov­ern­ment should not keep chang­ing its poli­cies with each elec­tion. Just de­velop Amar­a­vati here and don’t cheat us,” said Mr Rao, who is also a of im­mi­gra­tion, said in a state­ment yes­ter­day. “This Bangladesh­i na­tional will be de­ported and black­listed from en­ter­ing Malaysia for­ever,” Mr Khairul said.</p>
    <p>He did not say why Mr Ray­han was ar­rested or whether he was sus­mem­ber of the coun­cil.</p>
    <p>The protests have gone vir­tual since March 22, when so­cial dis­tanc­ing norms were im­posed na­tion­wide to bat­tle the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. Farm­ers send tweets to min­is­ters, call lo­cal gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials by turn and share pho­tos of “mini-ag­i­ta­tions” in their houses on What­sApp.</p>
    <p>On the 200th day, they held a Zoom ses­sion with non-res­i­dent Tel­ugu-speak­ers at­tend­ing from 35 coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The state’s pre­vi­ous chief min­is­ter, Mr Chan­drababu Naidu, had planned to build the cap­i­tal in Amar­a­vati from scratch by the Kr­ishna River. He ac­quired 90 per cent of the 15,617ha re­quired for his project through an un­usual pool­ing sys­tem, of­fer­ing a de­vel­oped plot in the fu­ture city as pay­ment to each landowner.</p>
    <p>Most of those who gave up their land vol­un­tar­ily were large land­hold­ers, like Mr Rao, who ad­mit­ted that his ed­u­cated chil­dren held other pro­fes­sions and had no in­ter­est in con­tin­u­ing farm­ing.</p>
    <p>Some of the farm­ers trusted and sup­ported Mr Naidu’s party, which is now in the op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>The cap­i­tal area’s de­vel­op­ment pro­gressed slowly, as it was mired in lit­i­ga­tion over en­croach­ing river flood­plains. Also, the World Bank re­fused a loan af­ter al­le­ga­tions that farm­ers were be­ing co­erced into giv­ing up their land.</p>
    <p>Other than for two uni­ver­si­ties, the re­gion did not re­ceive much pri­vate in­vest­ment ei­ther.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, the new gov­ern­ment passed laws to re­peal the old plan pected of com­mit­ting a crime. Reuters could not reach the im­mi­gra­tion de­part­ment for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Qatar-based Al Jazeera said it was dis­turb­ing that Mr Ray­han had been ar­rested “for choos­ing to speak up about some of the ex­pe­riand build three cap­i­tals in­stead, un­prece­dented for any state in In­dia.</p>
    <p>Mr Reddy said: “The ear­lier gov­ern­ment pegged the cost es­ti­mate of build­ing Amar­a­vati’s ba­sic in­fra­struc­ture at 1,090 bil­lion ru­pees (S$20.2 bil­lion), while the spend­ing ca­pac­ity of any state gov­ern­ment is only five bil­lion ru­pees.</p>
    <p>“At 10 per cent of the es­ti­mated cost, we can de­velop places that al­ready have ba­sic in­fra­struc­ture into cap­i­tals.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter the protest­ing farm­ers met Mr Reddy in Fe­bru­ary, the gov­ern­ment ex­tended the pe­riod for them to re­ceive an­nu­ity – to­wards in­come lost – from 10 to 15 years.</p>
    <p>The farm­ers also said the land taken can­not be re­turned be­cause it has al­ready been di­vided into plots, which Mr Reddy said could be sold in the fu­ture. He also clar­i­fied that the new leg­isla­tive assem­bly would con­tinue to func­tion from Amar­a­vati.</p>
    <p>But the farm­ers are not sat­is­fied. Mr P. She­shababu, whose vil­lage of Nal­la­padu was the first to give its land for the cap­i­tal, said: “Only if the full cap­i­tal is here will this area de­velop. Af­ter promis­ing us a cap­i­tal and bet­ter land prices in the fu­ture, we will now get much less even if we sell.”</p>
    <p>Last week, some farm­ers, wear­ing face shields, held a press con­fer­ence dur­ing which they said they had writ­ten to the gov­er­nor ask­ing him not to ap­prove the law to build the three cap­i­tals.</p>
    <p>Mr Rao said: “We will do what it takes, even through the pan­demic.” ences of the voice­less and the vul­ner­a­ble”.</p>
    <p>Malaysia ar­rested hun­dreds of un­doc­u­mented for­eign­ers, in­clud­ing chil­dren and Ro­hingya refugees, when the coun­try was un­der lock­down to halt the spread of the coro­n­avirus. Ac­tivists have con­demned the ar­rests as in­hu­mane. Malaysian of­fi­cials said they were nec­es­sary to pre­vent the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic op­po­si­tion to mi­grant work­ers in the coun­try has been grow­ing, with some peo­ple ac­cus­ing them of spread­ing the coro­n­avirus and be­ing a bur­den on gov­ern­ment re­sources.</p>
    <p>There are also grow­ing con­cerns that the four-month-old ad­min­is­tra­tion of Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin is sti­fling dis­sent amid a se­ries of clam­p­downs, an accusation it has de­nied. Malaysi­akini, a lo­cal news por­tal, is fac­ing a con­tempt case over read­ers’ com­ments.</p>
    <p>Al Jazeera has said its staff and those in­ter­viewed in the doc­u­men­tary had faced abuse, death threats and the dis­clo­sure of their per­sonal de­tails on so­cial me­dia.</p>
