    <p>PRE­FER­RING TO SHOP IN PER­SON</p>
    <p>I am not the type who can shop on­line. I like to touch and feel fabrics, and I can’t vi­su­alise the colour or tex­ture when I see it on screen.</p>
    <p>MRS HILDA KHOO, who beat some</p>
    <p>400 shop­pers to be first in line to en­ter Takashimay­a yes­ter­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>Large crowds formed in Or­chard Road yes­ter­day morn­ing to snag the best Black Friday of­fers de­spite keen com­pe­ti­tion and deals from on­line re­tail­ers.</p>
    <p>Shop­pers cited a pref­er­ence for ap­prais­ing deals in per­son as a key rea­son for mak­ing the trip, as well as the nos­tal­gia fac­tor at Robinsons’ swan­song an­nual sale.</p>
    <p>Among those spot­ted deal-hunt­ing at Metro depart­ment store in Paragon mall was Ms Es­ther Tan, 53, who works in the oil and gas sec­tor. She had taken leave to ac­com­pany her el­derly mother to shop for shoes, skin­care prod­ucts and bed linen.</p>
    <p>“Metro gives a 20 per cent di­rect dis­count for my buys, so this will save me around $300,” she said.</p>
    <p>Many shop­pers said they had set aside the day to</p>
    <p>check out Black Friday sales.</p>
    <p>Health­care worker Hilda Khoo, who beat some 400 shop­pers to be first in line to en­ter Takashimay­a yes­ter­day morn­ing, had cleared her sched­ule for the day.</p>
    <p>The queue to en­ter the depart­ment store snaked from the first floor to the base­ment, as shop­pers kept at least 1m apart for so­cial distancing.</p>
    <p>Some shop­pers said that they chose to go to Takashimay­a as it is one of the big­ger depart­ment stores around.</p>
    <p>Mrs Khoo, 54, se­cured her po­si­tion at Takashimay­a 50 min­utes be­fore the shut­ters went up at 11am.</p>
    <p>Like Ms Tan, she pre­ferred to do her shop­ping at bricks-and-mor­tar out­lets, even as more Black Friday bar­gains go on­line. She was shop­ping for house­hold items, as she had re­cently moved.</p>
    <p>“I am not the type who can shop on­line. I like to touch and feel fabrics, and I can’t vi­su­alise the colour or tex­ture when I see it on screen,” said Mrs Khoo.</p>
    <p>While bar­gain hunters were out and about, The Straits Times found that the Or­chard Road area was less busy com­pared with past Black Fridays, as Covid-19 re­mains a con­sid­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Shorter queues were no­ticed dur­ing a stroll down the main shop­ping stretch yes­ter­day. Shops were also less packed.</p>
    <p>The mood was muted at Robinsons, which is hold­ing its fi­nal Black Friday sale, al­though the 162-yearold depart­ment store, which an­nounced its liq­ui­da­tion last month, did at­tract some loyal cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong Chong King, 56, a re­tiree, said he has been go­ing to the store since he was young. “It was very much a part of my child­hood,” he said.</p>
    <p>He was in the queue to en­ter the store at The Heeren at 10am – a late hour com­pared with past years, he said. “When stores first started do­ing Black Friday sales, they used to open very early at 7am, and we would be there around 6.30am.”</p>
    <p>On­line stores such as Ama­zon and Lazada were also of­fer­ing deep Black Friday dis­counts, with up to 30 per cent off the sticker price on rel­a­tively big-ticket items such as Ap­ple’s AirPods Pro.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to ST’s queries, on­line re­tailer Lazada said it saw a nearly seven-fold in­crease in sales</p>
    <p>EV­ERY CENT COUNTS</p>
    <p>Metro gives a 20 per cent di­rect dis­count for my buys, so this will save me around $300.</p>
    <p>MS ES­THER TAN, who took leave yes­ter­day to ac­com­pany her el­derly mother to look for shoes, skin­care prod­ucts and bed linen.</p>
    <p>THOSE WERE THE DAYS</p>
    <p>When stores first started do­ing Black Friday sales, they used to open very early at 7am, and we would be there around 6.30am.</p>
    <p>MR ONG CHONG KING, a re­tiree who was in the queue to en­ter Robinsons at The Heeren at 10am.</p>
    <p>ITEMS IN DE­MAND ON­LINE</p>
    <p>Prod­uct cat­e­gories that saw the largest year-on-year spikes rang­ing from 10 to 15 times in­clude sports at­tire, tele­vi­sions and fur­ni­ture.</p>
    <p>A LAZADA SPOKESMAN, in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>dur­ing the first two hours of sales in com­par­i­son with last year’s Black Friday event.</p>
    <p>“Prod­uct cat­e­gories that saw the largest year-on-year spikes rang­ing from 10 to 15 times in­clude sports at­tire, tele­vi­sions and fur­ni­ture,” a Lazada spokesman said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Black Friday sales started in the United States as a way to mark the start of Christ­mas shop­ping. Stores typ­i­cally turn over their in­ven­tory with at­trac­tive dis­counts on the first Friday fol­low­ing Thanks­giv­ing there.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans are rar­ing to shop, judging by their en­thu­si­as­tic re­sponse to Black Friday deals of­fered by re­tail­ers this past week.</p>
    <p>This month’s ad­ver­tis­ing blitz has given a boost to sales, both on­line as well as in brick-and­mor­tar out­lets. Re­tail­ers at­tribute this to pent-up de­mand caused by travel re­stric­tions and the yearend fes­tive sea­son.</p>
    <p>Ms Eloise Sim, gen­eral man­ager of mar­ket­ing com­mu­ni­ca­tions at Har­vey Nor­man, says re­sponse to the Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings (SPH) Black Friday ad­ver­tise­ment cam­paign yes­ter­day in the English, Chi­nese and Malay news­pa­pers as well as on­line was pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>“Black Friday is one of the top sales events of the year for most re­tail­ers,” says Ms Sim, who adds that the store’s re­cliner chairs are a hot-sell­ing Black Friday item this year. “We have cu­rated loads of of­fers rang­ing from tele­vi­sions and home ap­pli­ances to note­books and IT pe­riph­er­als to so­fas and mat­tresses.”</p>
    <p>She says since the Sin­gles Day sales on Nov 11, the store has seen its bar­gains snapped up. She adds that con­sumers are also buying big­ger-ticket items, and go­ing for bet­ter qual­ity prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>“It could be due to the sav­ings from not be­ing able to travel abroad, and want­ing bet­ter ap­pli­ances and home fur­nish­ing items as con­sumers are spend­ing more time at home,” she says.</p>
    <p>“We are ex­pect­ing this trend to con­tinue from Black Friday right through to Cy­ber Mon­day on Nov 30.”</p>
    <p>Con­sumer elec­tron­ics re­tailer Courts Sin­ga­pore, which has been run­ning Black Friday sales since 2013, says its on­line sales for Sin­gles Day on Nov 11 grew by a dou­ble-digit per­cent­age year on year.</p>
    <p>“We are con­tin­u­ing Novem­ber fes­tive shop­ping for our cus­tomers from a suc­cess­ful Sin­gles Day and have kicked off Black Friday early, starting from Nov 21,” says Mr Matthew Hoang, group chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer of Courts</p>
    <p>Asia and coun­try chief ex­ec­u­tive of Courts Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“Com­put­ing and home and kitchen ap­pli­ances have tra­di­tion­ally been the more pop­u­lar prod­uct cat­e­gories dur­ing the Novem­ber spend­ing sea­son,” he adds. “We be­lieve Sin­ga­pore­ans place their trust in es­tab­lished brands, whether they pre­fer shop­ping on­line or in stores.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Gain City – which started its Black Friday ad­ver­tis­ing cam­paign on Nov 16 – has seen sales sur­pass­ing last year’s in the run-up to Black Friday.</p>
    <p>“We have seen a surge of more than 50 per cent in our on­line sales and recorded an­other strong growth in de­mand via our re­tail stores com­pared with the same pe­riod last year,” says Mr Kenny Teo, man­ag­ing direc­tor of Gain City, which has 14 stores across the is­land.</p>
    <p>“This year, our Me­ga­s­tore@ Sungei Kadut also reg­is­tered strong de­mand for fur­ni­ture and mat­tresses. I think with the travel re­stric­tions, more peo­ple are splurg­ing on en­hanc­ing their life­style and per­sonal com­fort.”</p>
    <p>Here are some of the spe­cially crafted deals by re­tail­ers for fur­ni­ture and home ac­ces­sories from the Black Friday week­end till Cy­ber Mon­day.</p>
