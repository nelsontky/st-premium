    <p>Ro­main Gros­jean is as­sisted by med­i­cal crew af­ter es­cap­ing from his blaz­ing car fol­low­ing a hor­rific first-lap crash at For­mula One’s Bahrain Grand Prix yes­ter­day. His car split in two and burst into flames. The French driver’s Haas skewed into a bar­rier on Turn 3, com­ing out the other side ablaze and in two parts. Track mar­shals helped him clam­ber over the bar­rier to safety as they ex­tin­guished the fire. The clearly shaken driver was taken back to the pits by the med­i­cal car at the Sakhir Cir­cuit. In a tweet, Haas said: “Ro­main has some mi­nor burns on his hands and an­kles but other­wise he is ok. He is with the doctors just now.” The team added later that he had been taken to a hos­pi­tal “as a pre­cau­tion and for fur­ther med­i­cal eval­u­a­tion”. The race was im­me­di­ately red-flagged and the rest of the cars filed back to the pit lane. The race re­sult was not known at press time.</p>
