    <p>An in­sur­ance pro­gramme will be de­vel­oped to help em­ploy­ers man­age un­ex­pect­edly large med­i­cal ex­penses of mi­grant work­ers, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power will also care­fully con­sider the cost­shar­ing model for higher stan­dards in mi­grant worker dor­mi­to­ries, even as a stronger sys­tem of med­i­cal sup­port for the work­ers is built, she added.</p>
    <p>“As im­por­tant as it is to safe­guard the health and well­ness of our work­ers, we must also en­sure the higher costs are sus­tain­able,” she said in her min­istry’s Ad­den­dum to the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress.</p>
    <p>These ef­forts are part of the min­istry’s greater fo­cus on the well­be­ing of Sin­ga­pore’s work­force, as Covid-19 has caused con­sid­er­able stress to in­di­vid­u­als, she noted.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, the Work In­jury Com­pen­sa­tion Act (Wica) re­quires em­ploy­ers to buy work in­jury com­pen­sa­tion in­sur­ance for all man­ual em­ploy­ees and non-man­ual em­ploy­ees earn­ing up to $2,100 a month.The com­pen­sa­tion lim­its un­der Wica were raised this year and cover med­i­cal ex­penses up to $45,000, or up to one year from the date of the ac­ci­dent, which­ever comes first.</p>
    <p>The safety and liv­ing con­di­tions of for­eign work­ers have been in the spot­light af­ter dor­mi­to­ries saw huge clus­ters of Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said the new As­sur­ance, Care and En­gage­ment Group in her min­istry will en­sure mi­grant worker hous­ing is safe and re­silient against pub­lic health threats. It will also team up with the com­mu­nity and mi­grant worker groups to meet work­ers’ so­cial needs.</p>
    <p>The min­istry will also part­ner trade as­so­ci­a­tions and cham­bers, non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions and pro­fes­sional bod­ies to pro­vide a bet­ter sup­port net­work for all work­ers, she added.</p>
    <p>At the same time, im­prov­ing the wages of those at the lower end re­mains a key pri­or­ity of the min­istry, al­though the present fo­cus is to en­sure lower-in­come lo­cals stay em­ployed amid the eco­nomic down­turn.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said the Pro­gres­sive Wage Model will be ex­panded over time to more sec­tors in a way that is prac­ti­cal and en­sures lo­cal un­em­ploy­ment re­mains low.</p>
    <p>The model sets out min­i­mum salaries for lo­cal work­ers in var­i­ous roles along a ca­reer and skills pro­gres­sion frame­work. It is com­pul­sory in the clean­ing, se­cu­rity and land­scap­ing sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Rais­ing wages at the lower end needs a long-term com­mit­ment and new mind­sets among em­ploy­ers, ser­vice buy­ers and so­ci­ety at large, Mrs Teo said.</p>
    <p>“We may have to pay slightly more for ser­vices so that low­er­in­come work­ers are able to take on bet­ter jobs and earn higher wages. To­gether with the Gov­ern­ment’s sup­port for lower-in­come work­ers through Work­fare and other schemes, it will help us mit­i­gate in­equal­i­ties and strengthen our so­cial com­pact,” she added</p>
    <p>Other ac­tion plans on the min­istry’s agenda to fos­ter an in­clu­sive work­force and pro­gres­sive work­places in­clude re­view­ing reg­u­larly the Work­fare and Sil­ver Sup­port schemes to fix gaps in so­cial safety nets for low-wage older work­ers and se­nior cit­i­zens.</p>
