    <p>Malaysia’s Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin yes­ter­day called for bi­par­ti­san co­op­er­a­tion to refine the coun­try’s bud­get for next year, say­ing that he wel­comed views that could ben­e­fit the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with television news chan­nel Astro Awani, Tan Sri Muhyid­din said in­clu­sive­ness is needed as Bud­get 2021 “isn’t for the gov­ern­ment but for the rakyat (peo­ple)”. “Prac­tis­ing in­clu­sive­ness is good, no mat­ter with whom. We’re ready to re­ceive any feed­back and sug­ges­tion; we will ob­serve and refine it,” he said.</p>
    <p>He is also mulling over the pos­si­bil­ity of ex­pand­ing bi­par­ti­san co­op­er­a­tion be­yond Bud­get 2021, by invit­ing the op­po­si­tion to sit in on some gov­ern­ment meet­ings.</p>
    <p>“For the next level, I’m think­ing about invit­ing the op­po­si­tion to be on the Eco­nomic Ac­tion Coun­cil, which I chair ev­ery week, or the meet­ing to man­age Covid-19, which I chair ev­ery day. They can share their views if they feel the steps taken by us are in­ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>“This is not about giv­ing credit to them, but for the peo­ple to ben­e­fit from their views,” he said.</p>
    <p>This comes as the gov­ern­ment gets flak for al­lo­cat­ing RM85.5 mil­lion (S$27.9 mil­lion) to res­ur­rect its pro­pa­ganda arm – the Spe­cial Af­fairs Depart­ment, or Jasa.</p>
    <p>In 2018, then rul­ing pact Barisan Na­sional (BN) had al­lo­cated RM30 mil­lion to the unit, which han­dles gov­ern­ment com­mu­ni­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>For­mer youth and sports min­is­ter Syed Sad­diq Syed Ab­dul Rah­man on Fri­day tweeted: “Un­for­tu­nately, the al­lo­ca­tion to re­pair de­pleted schools has been re­duced by RM58 mil­lion. The men­tal health al­lo­ca­tion is only RM24 mil­lion.”</p>
    <p>Jasa was used by BN to at­tack de­trac­tors through so-called “cy­bertroop­ers” post­ing par­ti­san mes­sages on­line, but it was abol­ished by the Ma­hathir Mo­hamad ad­min­is­tra­tion after Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) came to power in 2018.</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party’s (DAP) sec­re­tary-gen­eral and Malaysia’s for­mer fi­nance min­is­ter Lim Guan Eng said yes­ter­day: “In a nor­mal democ­racy, there is no place for such a pro­pa­ganda agency that uses pub­lic funds to spread lies and fake news.</p>
    <p>“Par­lia­men­tary rules pro­vide for the fi­nance min­is­ter to rep­re­sent the gov­ern­ment to amend the bud­get pro­pos­als. DAP calls on the Prime Min­is­ter and the gov­ern­ment to com­mit pub­licly im­me­di­ately to with­draw the al­lo­ca­tion to Jasa if the gov­ern­ment is sin­cere in seek­ing a Unity Bud­get.”</p>
    <p>Univer­siti Malaya’s so­cio-po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst Awang Azman Awang Pawi said it ap­pears that the gov­ern­ment is gear­ing up, through its new bud­get, for the next gen­eral elec­tion. “The gov­ern­ment’s move to re­vive Jasa looks like it’s try­ing to en­sure that po­lit­i­cal com­mu­ni­ca­tion runs smoothly. It also seems like it wants to avoid be­ing in the same sit­u­a­tion as PH, which had no com­mu­ni­ca­tion ma­chin­ery,” he told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>“Hard to say if this (bud­get) is re­ally meant to fight Covid-19 as it looks like an elec­tion bud­get – cash hand­outs and some schemes be­ing re­branded... It’s a mis­placed pri­or­ity be­cause the health sec­tor should be given pri­or­ity,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sun­way Univer­sity po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Wong Chin Huat said that with Mr Muhyid­din putting the elec­tion be­fore the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, it may just make him an eas­ier tar­get for Umno and PH when one is called.</p>
    <p>“De­spite his con­tro­ver­sial rise to power, Muhyid­din has a great op­por­tu­nity to emerge states­man­like. (But) out of in­se­cu­rity and ar­ro­gance, he now gives the op­po­si­tion a strong case to vote down his bud­get,” he told ST, not­ing the mo­ment of truth will come when the bud­get is put to a vote on Nov 23.</p>
    <p>By con­ven­tion, the fail­ure to pass the bud­get to fund the gov­ern­ment is akin to a no-con­fi­dence mo­tion that would lead to the col­lapse of the ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>While Umno wel­comed Jasa’s re­vival, party vice-pres­i­dent Khaled Nordin said the huge al­lo­ca­tion re­quired fur­ther ex­pla­na­tion.</p>
    <p>“If there is rea­son­able jus­ti­fi­ca­tion, then it is okay for the large al­lo­ca­tion. Maybe a weak gov­ern­ment needs a big­ger loud­speaker,” he was quoted as say­ing yes­ter­day by news site Free Malaysia To­day.</p>
