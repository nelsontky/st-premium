    <p>In the com­ing weeks, Covid-19 test­ing will be of­fered to peo­ple work­ing at key de­liv­ery cen­tres, such as the Pasir Pan­jang Whole­sale Cen­tre, and lo­gis­tics and de­liv­ery com­pa­nies, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>These test­ing op­er­a­tions are part of the pro­gres­sive roll-out of com­mu­nity surveillan­ce test­ing, said the min­istry, and the costs of these tests will be fully borne by the Govern­ment.</p>
    <p>“We strongly en­cour­age in­di­vid­u­als in these iden­ti­fied com­mu­nity groups to come for­ward and utilise the test­ing ser­vices of­fered,” MOH added.</p>
    <p>Since Septem­ber, more than 5,000 peo­ple have been tested in Ma­rine Pa­rade, Ang Mo Kio and Ta­man Jurong as part of MOH’s com­mu­nity surveillan­ce test­ing ef­forts.</p>
    <p>All who have par­tic­i­pated in these vol­un­tary test­ing ex­er­cises have tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19, MOH added.</p>
    <p>“The re­sults of the com­mu­nity test­ing op­er­a­tions in­di­cate very low preva­lence rates in the com­mu­nity, and are an in­di­ca­tor that our safe man­age­ment mea­sures are help­ing to keep our com­mu­nity safe,” said an MOH spokesman.</p>
    <p>The min­istry also an­nounced that all trav­ellers en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore from 11.59pm to­mor­row who have trav­elled to Fin­land and Tur­key in the past 14 days will have to serve a stay-home no­tice (SHN) at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties for 14 days, even if they had ob­tained ap­proval to opt out ear­lier. This is be­cause there has been a re­cent in­crease in cases re­ported in those two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, such trav­ellers were al­lowed to stay at a suitable place of res­i­dence for their 14-day SHN.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, trav­ellers from Fiji, South Korea, Sri Lanka and Thai­land are still al­lowed to ap­ply to opt out of ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties and re­main at their place of res­i­dence for their 14-day SHN.</p>
    <p>They have to meet spe­cific cri­te­ria, in­clud­ing oc­cu­py­ing their place of res­i­dence alone or only with house­hold mem­bers with the same travel his­tory, who are also un­der an SHN of the same du­ra­tion.</p>
