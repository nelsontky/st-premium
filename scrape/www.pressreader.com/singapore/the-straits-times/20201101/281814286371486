    <p>Across the chasm of the United States’ po­lit­i­cal di­vide, each side views the other not just as those with dif­fer­ent po­lit­i­cal ide­ol­ogy, but as an en­emy.</p>
    <p>The more they den­i­grate each other, which they do, the harder their at­ti­tude.</p>
    <p>And an­a­lysts are warn­ing of a height­ened risk of vi­o­lence dur­ing and af­ter the Nov 3 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“The in­gre­di­ents for un­rest are present,” the In­ter­na­tional Cri­sis Group warned in a re­port last Wed­nes­day. “The elec­torate is po­larised, both sides frame the stakes as ex­is­ten­tial, vi­o­lent ac­tors could dis­rupt the process and pro­tracted con­tes­ta­tion is pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>It added: “Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s of­ten in­cen­di­ary rhetoric sug­gests he will more likely stoke than calm ten­sions.</p>
    <p>“Be­yond the im­pli­ca­tions for any Amer­i­cans caught up in un­rest, the elec­tion will be a har­bin­ger of whether its in­sti­tu­tions can guide the US safely through a pe­riod of so­cio-po­lit­i­cal change. If not, the world’s most pow­er­ful coun­try could face a pe­riod of grow­ing in­sta­bil­ity and in­creas­ingly di­min­ished cred­i­bil­ity abroad.”</p>
    <p>FBI WARN­ING</p>
    <p>Data shows that in re­cent years, most ter­ror­ist vi­o­lence in the US has come from right-wing ex­trem­ists, and many see Mr Trump as hav­ing em­bold­ened the right wing since he took of­fice in 2017.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent is an “ac­cel­er­ant”, Dr Colin P. Clarke told The Straits Times’ Asian In­sider.</p>
    <p>“His rhetoric has been... in­cen­di­ary, de­lib­er­ately so, and he has... stoked the flames and am­pli­fied ten­sions,” said the se­nior re­search fel­low at The So­ufan Cen­tre, a global se­cu­rity con­sul­tancy.</p>
    <p>In the first pres­i­den­tial de­bate on Sept 29, Mr Trump was put on the spot by moder­a­tor Chris Wal­lace to con­demn white su­prem­a­cists, and only man­aged to say “Proud Boys, stand back and stand by” – a com­ment re­port­edly cel­e­brated by the right-wing group.</p>
    <p>It was not the first time that the Pres­i­dent has been am­biva­lent.</p>
    <p>Fa­mously, it was his com­ment on Char­lottesvill­e, Vir­ginia, that trig­gered Demo­crat Joe Bi­den to chal­lenge him for the pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>On Aug 11, 2017, torch-car­ry­ing white su­prem­a­cists marched through the col­lege town be­fore clash­ing with counter protesters the next day, an in­ci­dent which claimed the life of 32-year-old Ms Heather Heyer.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump ac­knowl­edged “bad peo­ple” were present that day, but also said there were “fine peo­ple... on both sides”.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to the right-wing threat, other groups are also re­port­edly arm­ing them­selves.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, the FBI warned law en­force­ment agen­cies that vi­o­lent ex­trem­ists “across the ide­o­log­i­cal spec­trum likely will con­tinue to plot against gov­ern­ment and elec­tion-re­lated tar­gets to ex­press their di­verse griev­ances in­volv­ing gov­ern­ment poli­cies and ac­tions”.</p>
    <p>IN­STI­TU­TIONAL RE­SILIENCE</p>
    <p>Just three weeks ago, a mili­tia group was ex­posed and its mem­bers charged by the FBI as they got close to act­ing on a plan to kid­nap the gov­er­nor of Michi­gan and over­throw the state gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The US is no stranger to po­lit­i­cal vi­o­lence, and the re­silience of its in­sti­tu­tions has largely pre­vailed. But this elec­tion is com­ing at a time of un­prece­dented stress, with the na­tion in the grip of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic that is peak­ing for the third time this year.</p>
    <p>This, in a so­ci­ety where per capita gun own­er­ship is the high­est world­wide and mili­tias can legally buy quan­ti­ties of small arms, in­clud­ing semi-au­to­matic ri­fles. “There’s a very acute po­ten­tial for vi­o­lence,” Dr Clarke said.</p>
    <p>The broader pool of po­ten­tial ex­trem­ists has grown dur­ing the pan­demic, with Amer­i­cans at home and on­line con­sum­ing vast quan­ti­ties of pro­pa­ganda and dis­in­for­ma­tion, Dr Clarke and Dr Daniel By­man, se­nior fel­low at Brook­ings’ Cen­tre for Mid­dle East Pol­icy, wrote in a joint pa­per.</p>
    <p>“Even if a rel­a­tively small per­cent­age of peo­ple might ac­tu­ally mo­bilise to vi­o­lence, the milieu from which they will emerge has metas­ta­sised sig­nif­i­cantly,” they said in their pa­per.</p>
    <p>“The elec­tion is in­creas­ingly per­ceived as a ‘win­ner-takes-all’ con­test, with no room for those who don’t iden­tify with a spe­cific side.”</p>
    <p>Dr Clarke said: “A lot of peo­ple are right­fully con­cerned. Law en­force­ment is on edge. And I think there’s a range of groups from across the spec­trum, from the far left to the far right.</p>
    <p>“I’m more con­cerned with the far right be­cause the data shows that to date they’ve just been far more dan­ger­ous and lethal.”</p>
    <p>GUN-TOT­ING “POLL WATCH­ERS”?</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has also urged sup­port­ers to act as poll watch­ers – which ex­perts say is laced with risk.</p>
    <p>Last Wed­nes­day, a Michi­gan judge blocked a ban on openly car­ry­ing firearms at the state’s polling places on Nov 3.</p>
    <p>Pro-gun groups had chal­lenged a di­rec­tive from Michi­gan Sec­re­tary of State Jo­ce­lyn Ben­son ban­ning firearms at polling places, clerk’s of­fices and lo­ca­tions where ab­sen­tee bal­lots will be tal­lied.</p>
    <p>The or­der also barred peo­ple openly car­ry­ing guns from com­ing within 100ft of polling cen­tres.</p>
    <p>“There’s no ques­tion that (poll watch­ers) is not a good idea,” Dr Clarke said. “At a bare min­i­mum, it’s in­tim­i­da­tion.</p>
    <p>“If th­ese in­di­vid­u­als are show­ing up armed with AR-15s (semi-au­to­matic as­sault ri­fles, le­gal un­der US law), they’re do­ing more than just watch­ing. And the Pres­i­dent’s al­ready laid the ground­work by say­ing the elec­tion is rigged, (that) if he loses, the Democrats stole it. So that’s just not help­ful.”</p>
    <p>Some ex­treme right-wing groups ac­tu­ally want a civil war, or be­lieve they are in the be­gin­ning of one. In re­sponse, oth­ers, in­clud­ing African Amer­i­cans, are also arm­ing them­selves.</p>
    <p>The At­lantic, in its Novem­ber is­sue, quotes 55-year-old Stewart Rhodes, founder of the right-wing mil­i­tant group called Oath Keep­ers formed in 2009, as say­ing: “We’ve de­scended into civil war.”</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, when Kyle Rit­ten­house, 17, was charged with shoot­ing and killing two peo­ple at protests over po­lice bru­tal­ity in Kenosha, Wis­con­sin, Mr Rhodes called him “a Hero, a Pa­triot” on Twit­ter. And when a Trump sup­porter was killed later in Port­land, Ore­gon, Mr Rhodes de­clared “Civil war is here, right now”.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter then banned him from the plat­form for in­cit­ing vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, in down­town Wash­ing­ton, in the streets around the White House, busi­nesses that had taken down their pro­tec­tive wooden boards dur­ing a brief respite af­ter the vi­o­lence dur­ing this sum­mer’s protests, are board­ing up again.</p>
    <p>In Chicago, of­fi­cials re­cently held an “all-haz­ards drill” to “re­ally walk through in a log­i­cal way” how they might re­spond to pos­si­ble elec­tion-re­lated threats, Mayor Lori Light­foot said last week.</p>
    <p>“Given what we ex­pe­ri­enced over the course of the spring and the sum­mer, we can’t pre­sume that what’s go­ing to hap­pen... is go­ing to be peace­ful,” she said. “We are pre­par­ing for the worst.”</p>
