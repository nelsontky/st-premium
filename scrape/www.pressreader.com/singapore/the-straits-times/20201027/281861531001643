    <p>Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga vowed yes­ter­day to build a car­bon-neu­tral “green so­ci­ety” by 2050, mark­ing a par­a­digm shift for the world’s fifth-largest green­house gas emit­ter.</p>
    <p>The pledge will bring Ja­pan in line with the Euro­pean Union’s 2050 goal, and also sets it a decade ahead of China’s 2060 aim, which was an­nounced last month.</p>
    <p>While Mr Suga did not lay out a de­tailed road map to achieve the tar­get, his pledge came as global en­vi­ron­men­tal ac­tivists have lam­basted the world’s third-largest econ­omy for its luke­warm mea­sures to fight global warm­ing. He made the com­mit­ment in a wide-rang­ing, 25-minute de­but pol­icy speech in the Ja­panese Diet as Prime Min­is­ter, draw­ing ap­plause from law­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>“Re­spond­ing to cli­mate change should no longer be seen as a con­straint on eco­nomic growth,” Mr Suga said. “We must change our way of think­ing and re­alise that the adop­tion of proac­tive mea­sures to achieve struc­tural re­form in in­dus­try will lead to sig­nif­i­cant growth in the econ­omy.”</p>
    <p>Also at the ses­sion was his pre­de­ces­sor Shinzo Abe, who stepped down for health rea­sons last month but re­mains MP for a con­stituency in his home town Ya­m­aguchi.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s pre­vi­ously-stated goal was to cut car­bon emis­sions by 80 per cent by 2050.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga cited next-gen­er­a­tion so­lar cells and car­bon re­cy­cling as po­ten­tial in­no­va­tions that might help Ja­pan achieve its tar­get.</p>
    <p>But he added that nu­clear power – adopted with “the high­est pri­or­ity on safety” – will con­tinue to be part of the car­bon-neu­tral push.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he did not give any de­tails on how Ja­pan might wean it­self from its re­liance on coal power – which has only grown as the Fukushima dis­as­ter of 2011 forced the shut­down of nu­clear plants na­tion­wide – but said the coun­try will “fun­da­men­tally change its pol­icy on coal-fired power gen­er­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>It is un­clear if this means that Ja­pan will stop build­ing what it calls en­ergy-ef­fi­cient coal power plants.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan said in July that it will re­tire 100 age­ing, in­ef­fi­cient coal plants over the next decade, out of the 140 plants now in op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>An­other 16 are be­ing built. In­dus­try Min­is­ter Hiroshi Ka­jiyama told a news con­fer­ence later that de­tailed plans to achieve the net-zero car­bon goal will be drawn up by the end of this year, in­clud­ing con­crete mea­sures to pro­mote hy­dro­gen en­ergy, bat­tery stor­age, car­bon re­cy­cling and wind power.</p>
    <p>The Asia In­vestor Group on Cli­mate Change (AIGCC) said that in­vestors are on the look­out for “con­crete near-term mea­sures that in­cen­tivise a smooth tran­si­tion to­wards net-zero emis­sions in Ja­pan, start­ing with up­dated 2030 tar­gets for en­ergy and emis­sions”.</p>
    <p>Un­der the cur­rent 2030 plan, drawn up with 2015 lev­els as the base­line, Ja­pan aims to cut its coal de­pen­dency from 32 per cent to 26 per cent and in­crease its tar­get for re­new­ables from 17 per cent to up to 24 per cent.</p>
    <p>The AIGCC es­ti­mates that re­new­ables must make up half of Ja­pan’s en­ergy mix by that year, with lim­ited use of coal and gas, so as to main­tain an or­derly tran­si­tion con­sis­tent with cap­ping the global tem­per­a­ture rise at 1.5 deg C.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga also dis­cussed the need to re­vi­talise a pan­demic-hit econ­omy in his speech, vow­ing to bal­ance so­cio-eco­nomic needs with curb­ing the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>He re­it­er­ated his digi­ti­sa­tion push and vowed to pro­mote tele­work and tourism, so as to woo more peo­ple to Ja­pan’s ru­ral re­gions, which are de­mo­graph­i­cally hol­low­ing out.</p>
    <p>On di­plo­macy, he echoed Mr Abe’s play­book, af­firm­ing the push to re­alise a Free and Open Indo-Pa­cific with those that share com­mon ba­sic val­ues, such as Asean, Aus­tralia, In­dia and Europe, along­side the need to work to­gether with China and South Korea to forge ties.</p>
