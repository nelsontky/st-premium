    <p>LEIPZIG (Ger­many) • Ger­man po­lice said demon­stra­tors protest­ing against coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions at­tacked them in the city of Leipzig on Satur­day, after the crowd was told to dis­perse.</p>
    <p>“There were nu­mer­ous at­tacks against se­cu­rity forces,” po­lice tweeted, while the me­dia broad­cast images of pro­jec­tiles and fire­works thrown at po­lice who had es­tab­lished a se­cu­rity cor­don near the city’s main train sta­tion.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of con­firmed coro­n­avirus cases in Ger­many in­creased by 16,017 to 658,505, ac­cord­ing to data from the Robert Koch In­sti­tute for in­fec­tious dis­eases yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The re­ported death toll rose by 63 to 11,289, the tally showed.</p>
    <p>This fol­lowed a record 23,000 new virus cases on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Satur­day’s protest in the east­ern Ger­man city saw an es­ti­mated crowd of around 20,000, and Ger­man me­dia re­ported that some of those who clashed with po­lice were mem­bers of far-right groups.</p>
    <p>Some of the pro­test­ers also at­tacked jour­nal­ists and peo­ple tak­ing part in a counter-demon­stra­tion in Leipzig, a large stu­dent city.</p>
    <p>The po­lice were out in force and made sev­eral ar­rests, but the clashes con­tin­ued into the evening.</p>
    <p>Ig­nor­ing the dis­per­sal or­ders, hun­dreds of peo­ple marched up one of Leipzig’s main streets, shout­ing “Merkel must go!” and “Peace, free­dom, no dic­ta­tor­ship”, ac­cord­ing to lo­cal me­dia.</p>
    <p>The municipal au­thor­i­ties said the pro­test­ers had in­fringed the con­di­tions un­der which they were al­lowed to hold their demon­stra­tion.</p>
    <p>To curb the coro­n­avirus spike in Ger­many, Europe’s big­gest econ­omy, Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel has ap­pealed to peo­ple to help achieve a turn­around by re­spect­ing a new round of shut­downs un­til the end of the month.</p>
    <p>Un­der the new mea­sures, Ger­mans will not be con­fined to their homes, but bars, cafes and restau­rants must close, as well as the­atres, opera houses and cine­mas.</p>
    <p>Look­ing ahead to the fes­tive sea­son, Dr Merkel has ruled out any “lav­ish New Year’s Eve par­ties”, but held out hope that fam­i­lies will be able to cel­e­brate Christ­mas to­gether.</p>
    <p>In Leipzig, pro­tester Robert Koehn, 39, called the anti-virus mea­sures dis­pro­por­tion­ate.</p>
    <p>“I sim­ply see the col­lat­eral dam­age that these mea­sures cause: the iso­la­tion of peo­ple, the bank­ruptcy that threat­ens them,” he said.</p>
    <p>A fel­low pro­tester who gave her name as Anne, 65, said: “For me, there is no virus; they cite the coro­n­avirus cri­sis as a mo­tive, but there are other things be­hind this.”</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers of the protest called for “the im­me­di­ate lift­ing of re­stric­tions to fun­da­men­tal rights” aris­ing from mea­sures taken to pre­vent the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>Po­lice or­dered the demon­stra­tors sev­eral times to re­spect a dis­tance of 1.5m from one an­other and to wear pro­tec­tive masks.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to re­gional pub­lic tele­vi­sion broad­caster MDR, flags re­call­ing the Ger­man Re­ich or em­pire that col­lapsed after World War I were waved by some pro­test­ers, and mem­bers of neo-Nazi group NPD were re­port­edly seen in the crowd.</p>
    <p>Sax­ony, the state where Leipzig is lo­cated, is con­sid­ered a strong­hold of far-right Ger­man na­tion­al­ists, but the rally or­gan­is­ers con­sider them­selves as “free thinkers” rep­re­sent­ing a range of po­lit­i­cal and so­cial move­ments.</p>
    <p>The demon­stra­tors are closely tracked by the Ger­man au­thor­i­ties, es­pe­cially since sev­eral hun­dred pro­test­ers forced their way past po­lice bar­ri­ers and onto the steps of the na­tional Par­lia­ment in late Au­gust.</p>
