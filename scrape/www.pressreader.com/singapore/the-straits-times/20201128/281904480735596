    <p>Can a po­lit­i­cal sys­tem be changed from within? That’s the ques­tion grip­ping Thai­land these days, amid near daily protests chal­leng­ing the roy­al­ist mil­i­tary es­tab­lish­ment helmed by King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn.</p>
    <p>“We joke among our­selves, that if we can­not re­form the monar­chy through Par­lia­ment, then we should have a rev­o­lu­tion,” says Ms Chon­thicha Jan­grew, who, at the age of 27, counts her­self as an “elder” among the lead­ers driv­ing the demon­stra­tions.</p>
    <p>It is a joke that has be­come darker with the av­enues for po­lit­i­cal ne­go­ti­a­tion steadily closed off and key youth lead­ers slapped with the dreaded lese ma­jeste charge that comes with a jail term of up to 15 years.</p>
    <p>Given the seis­mic de­vel­op­ments since last year’s gen­eral elec­tion, it’s hard to tell where Thai­land is now head­ing.</p>
    <p>In their re­cently launched book, Fu­ture For­ward: The Rise And Fall Of A Thai Po­lit­i­cal Party, po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tists Dun­can McCargo and An­yarat Chattharak­ul chart the me­te­oric rise and dis­so­lu­tion of the new-gen­er­a­tion party that shook the very foun­da­tion of Thai pol­i­tics. To­day, it reads like both a postscript and star chart of what’s in store for Thai­land.</p>
    <p>It was Fu­ture For­ward Party’s court-man­dated ban in Fe­bru­ary that sparked the youth demon­stra­tions roil­ing the coun­try now. But Thai­land’s young pro­test­ers have since pro­gressed to mak­ing more fun­da­men­tal de­mands: the res­ig­na­tion of for­mer coup leader and cur­rent Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha, the amend­ment of the Con­sti­tu­tion and monar­chy re­form.</p>
    <p>Fu­ture For­ward’s for­mer leader Thanathorn Juan­groon­gru­angkit, now banned from pol­i­tics, is tour­ing the coun­try to help lo­cal politi­cians af­fil­i­ated with his Pro­gres­sive Move­ment cam­paign for the Dec 20 elec­tions to fill seats in pro­vin­cial ad­min­is­tra­tive or­gan­i­sa­tions (PAOs).</p>
    <p>Roy­al­ists think he is or­ches­trat­ing the youth protests. They are pick­et­ing at his cam­paign lo­ca­tions to drive him out.</p>
    <p>Ms Chon­thicha, who says she has amassed over 20 po­lice charges for her po­lit­i­cal ad­vo­cacy, is amused that Mr Thanathorn is still keep­ing faith with Thai­land’s elec­toral sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“Our move­ment has al­ready gone far away from Thanathorn and Piyabutr,” she tells me, re­fer­ring to the party’s fire­brand for­mer sec­re­tary-gen­eral Piyabutr Saengkanok­kul.</p>
    <p>“They are here,” she says, tap­ping the cof­fee ta­ble we share. “And we are al­ready on the moon.” She waves her arm above her head. “We don’t care about the PAO elec­tion.”</p>
    <p>RE­JECT­ING THE SYS­TEM</p>
    <p>Such cynicism had been grow­ing. For some two decades prior, the king­dom was trapped in a colour-coded con­flict that pit­ted the Bangkok-cen­tred “yel­low” roy­al­ist, pro-mil­i­tary es­tab­lish­ment against “red” sup­port­ers of po­lit­i­cal par­ties linked to ex­iled for­mer prime min­is­ter Thaksin Shi­nawa­tra. Since 2006, the Con­sti­tu­tional Court has dis­solved two par­ties and thrown out three prime min­is­ters in the lat­ter camp.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Prayut tried to pa­per over this bit­ter di­vide after stag­ing a 2014 coup. But the new</p>
    <p>Con­sti­tu­tion ap­peared ex­haus­tively de­signed to counter the elec­toral might of big par­ties like the Thaksin-linked Pheu Thai.</p>
    <p>Then came Fu­ture For­ward, led by ac­tivist ty­coon Thanathorn and le­gal scholar Piyabutr. Both un­der the age 40 when they launched the party in 2018, they of­fered an al­ter­na­tive to vot­ers sick of the red-yel­low con­flict.</p>
    <p>Orange was its cho­sen shade. “For some, orange was the new red. For oth­ers, orange was the new yel­low,” write Dr McCargo and Dr Chattharak­ul.</p>
    <p>“For oth­ers, the beauty of orange was pre­cisely that it was nei­ther red nor yel­low. And for the re­main­der, who didn’t care about red or yel­low, orange was sim­ply a bright new colour.”</p>
    <p>Aided by the new and more pro­por­tion­ally rep­re­sen­ta­tive elec­tion sys­tem, Fu­ture For­ward emerged after the elec­tion as the third-big­gest party in Par­lia­ment, be­hind Pheu Thai and mil­i­tary-aligned Palang Pracharath.</p>
    <p>Part of its suc­cess was ac­ci­den­tal. Thai Raksa Chart, a sis­ter party of Pheu Thai cre­ated by the Thaksin camp to max­imise its chances un­der the new sys­tem, was banned some two weeks be­fore the elec­tion. Vot­ing tac­ti­cally, many Thai Raksa Chart sup­port­ers switched to Fu­ture For­ward.</p>
    <p>Still, Mr Thanathorn’s ap­peal among young vot­ers and his stri­dently anti-mil­i­tary stance made him an ex­is­ten­tial threat to the es­tab­lished pow­ers.</p>
    <p>The man­ner of Fu­ture For­ward’s demise re­mains con­tro­ver­sial. Mr Thanathorn dis­closed dur­ing a pub­lic talk that he of­fi­cially loaned the party 191 mil­lion baht (S$8.4 mil­lion). Al­though elec­tion laws make no spe­cific men­tion of loans, the Char­ter Court ruled that it was il­le­gal.</p>
    <p>Fu­ture For­ward’s dis­so­lu­tion con­vinced its sup­port­ers that the po­lit­i­cal sys­tem had be­come too rigged for mean­ing­ful par­tic­i­pa­tion – a theme con­stantly echoed in street protests now.</p>
    <p>Dr McCargo and Dr Chattharak­ul write that Fu­ture For­ward was plagued by a “struc­tural con­tra­dic­tion” from the start – was it “a po­lit­i­cal party, ded­i­cated to trans­form­ing the sys­tem from within” or “a bunch of dis­rup­tors, try­ing not so much to im­prove the sys­tem as to bring it crash­ing down”? With the party banned and Mr Thanathorn and Dr Piyabutr fo­cus­ing their en­ergy on the Pro­gres­sive Move­ment, they could “get on with their real project: po­lit­i­cal ag­i­ta­tion and in­tel­lec­tual sab­o­tage”, the au­thors add.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view two years ago, Mr Thanathorn sim­i­larly gave me the im­pres­sion he was more keen on chang­ing mind­sets than win­ning seats. He talked about a “war of ideas” that could take “decades”.</p>
    <p>“Coup d’etats do not hap­pen in iso­la­tion. They are in­ter­twined with other so­cial forces, par­tic­u­larly con­ser­va­tive forces,” he said then. “In or­der to stop the mil­i­tary coup d’etat you also have to con­front con­ser­va­tive cul­tures in Thai­land.”</p>
    <p>SAY­ING THE UN­SAYABLE</p>
    <p>The seed of po­lit­i­cal dis­rup­tion planted by Fu­ture For­ward has now taken on a life of its own.</p>
    <p>While Mr Thanathorn re­mains pop­u­lar, he has been up­staged by high school stu­dents half his age de­nounc­ing the old-style back­room deals that they claim are rob­bing them of their fu­ture.</p>
    <p>They are say­ing aloud what merely months ago was un­sayable, de­mand­ing that King Va­ji­ra­longkorn be gov­erned by the Con­sti­tu­tion like other Thais. With their pointed lan­guage about the palace and its ex­penses, they are re­defin­ing what it means to be rad­i­cal.</p>
    <p>Main­stream po­lit­i­cal par­ties have been left in their wake. Law­mak­ers have be­gun pro­cesses needed to amend the Con­sti­tu­tion, but will not touch the monar­chy is­sue. Op­po­si­tion leader Pheu Thai is also steer­ing clear. Its deputy leader and for­mer en­ergy min­is­ter Pichai Naripthaph­an tells me: “The monar­chy is a very im­por­tant in­sti­tu­tion for Thai­land. As a big party, Pheu Thai needs to be sure that this is­sue is ac­cept­able to sec­tions of so­ci­ety be­fore we de­cide to touch it.”</p>
    <p>Hav­ing schooled them­selves in sub­ver­sion, Thai youth are un­fazed by the in­sti­tu­tional hur­dles they know lie ahead. Ben­jama­porn Ni­vas, 16, whose Bad Stu­dent group has helped rally teenagers from elite high schools around Bangkok to de­mand ed­u­ca­tion re­form, has al­ready been sum­moned by the po­lice. “They can­not stop me,” she says. “I am ready for any­thing.”</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment’s re­sponse is still un­fold­ing. Both Mr Prayut and army chief Narong­pan Jitkaewtha­e have been bat­ting away talk of an­other coup – some­thing not out of the ques­tion in a coun­try that has seen 13 mil­i­tary takeovers since 1932.</p>
    <p>Protest lead­ers fac­ing charges of lese ma­jeste have ramped up their rhetoric on stage, mak­ing a rec­on­cil­i­a­tion panel mooted by Lower House Speaker Chuan Leek­pai look point­less.</p>
    <p>At least two shoot­ing in­ci­dents after re­cent protests have stirred un­ease, as well as sightings of men in mil­i­tary-style buzz cuts dressed in ca­sual clothes be­ing trans­ported to protest sites.</p>
    <p>King Va­ji­ra­longkorn, 68, has not ad­dressed the pro­test­ers’ de­mands ex­cept to say “we love them all the same” and “Thai­land is the land of com­pro­mise”.</p>
    <p>He has in­stead spent time close up with roy­al­ists who do not find it ap­pro­pri­ate to ques­tion his es­ti­mated wealth of more than US$40 bil­lion (S$54 bil­lion) and his con­trol of two army units. On Wed­nes­day, the King told key roy­al­ist leader Warong Dechgitvi­grom: “We must op­pose what is wrong.”</p>
    <p>All things con­sid­ered, Ms Chon­thicha knows it will take a while for Thai peo­ple to reach a con­sen­sus on the monar­chy’s role. But change, she says, is re­ally only a mat­ter of time.</p>
    <p>“The young peo­ple who want to re­form the monar­chy, in the next few years, they are go­ing to be adults who run this coun­try,” she says. “They are go­ing to teach their chil­dren their val­ues.”</p>
    <p>One can only hope that Thai­land’s youth up­ris­ing will nudge it along the path of evo­lu­tion, rather than trig­ger a vi­o­lent erup­tion.</p>
    <p>The seed of po­lit­i­cal dis­rup­tion planted by Fu­ture For­ward has now taken on a life of its own. While Mr Thanathorn Juan­groon­gru­angkit re­mains pop­u­lar, he has been up­staged by high school stu­dents half his age de­nounc­ing the old-style back­room deals that they claim are rob­bing them of their fu­ture.
