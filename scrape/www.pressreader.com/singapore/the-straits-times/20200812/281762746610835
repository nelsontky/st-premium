    <p>WUHAN • Rev­ellers dancing at an elec­tronic mu­sic fes­ti­val, long lines at break­fast stands, grid­locked traf­fic – the scenes in coro­n­avirus ground zero Wuhan these days would have been un­think­able in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Re­cov­ery in the cap­i­tal city of China’s cen­tral Hubei prov­ince af­ter a 76-day lock­down was lifted in April has brought life back onto its streets.</p>
    <p>The queues snaking out­side break­fast stands are a far cry from the ter­ri­fied crowds that lined up at hos­pi­tals in the first weeks af­ter the city was quar­an­tined in Jan­uary to curb the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>But business re­mains slow in the city of 11 mil­lion where the coro­n­avirus was first de­tected late last year.</p>
    <p>Many of the peo­ple first found to be in­fected worked at the Hua­nan Seafood Mar­ket. It still stands empty be­hind blue bar­ri­ers. Some ven­dors have re­opened their stalls else­where.</p>
    <p>Wuhan has also had time to look back on its trauma, though only some mem­o­ries make it into the of­fi­cial nar­ra­tive. At a pan­demic-themed ex­hi­bi­tion, fam­i­lies peer through glass at au­to­graphed haz­mat suits used by med­i­cal work­ers at the height of Wuhan’s out­break, in an at­tempt to doc­u­ment an un­prece­dented pe­riod in the city’s his­tory.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents ap­pre­ci­ate the city’s re­cov­ery. “Now I en­joy ev­ery day as if it were the last,” said Ms Hu Fenglian.</p>
    <p>In an­other part of China, the au­thor­i­ties have found the coro­n­avirus on the pack­ag­ing of im­ported frozen seafood that ar­rived from the north-eastern port city of Dalian, which re­cently bat­tled a surge of cases, the lo­cal gov­ern­ment said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The virus was found on the outer pack­ag­ing of frozen seafood bought by three com­pa­nies in Yan­tai, a port city in eastern Shan­dong prov­ince. The Yan­tai city gov­ern­ment did not say where the seafood orig­i­nated from.</p>
