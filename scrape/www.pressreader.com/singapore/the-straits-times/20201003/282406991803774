    <p>One Cham­pi­onship’s reign­ing atom­weight world cham­pion An­gela Lee and her hus­band, fel­low One fighter Bruno Pucci, are ex­pect­ing their first child to­gether.</p>
    <p>Lee, 24, who is based in Hawaii, an­nounced the news on so­cial me­dia on Thurs­day, re­veal­ing that she is 11 weeks preg­nant.</p>
    <p>While the gen­der of the baby is not known yet, she is due to give birth on April 21 next year.</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing her pregnancy as a “dream come true”, Lee wrote in an In­sta­gram post: “Be­com­ing a mum has al­ways been my ul­ti­mate goal; worth more to me than any amount of cham­pi­onship gold.</p>
    <p>“The best things come at the most un­ex­pected times. Baby made sure to sur­prise us just as I was in the best shape of my life.”</p>
    <p>She posed for pic­tures with a pos­i­tive pregnancy test kit and also posted sev­eral photograph­s of baby clothes.</p>
    <p>Pucci, 30, also shared the news on his own so­cial me­dia ac­counts, adding: “It’s funny how words are miss­ing to describe this feel­ing, but I can guar­an­tee that what we don’t lack are rea­sons to smile!”</p>
    <p>The cou­ple were con­grat­u­lated by fam­ily and friends, in­clud­ing fel­low fighter Stamp Fair­tex, One’s first two-sport world cham­pion.</p>
    <p>Lee and Pucci tied the knot more than two years ago in a cer­e­mony held in Hawaii.</p>
    <p>With the Covid-19 pan­demic putting plans to com­pete on hold, Lee’s last fight was last Oc­to­ber, when she re­tained her One atom­weight ti­tle against Xiong Jing­nan at the One: Cen­tury event in Tokyo.</p>
    <p>The five-time One women’s atom­weight cham­pion has, how­ever, been train­ing with her fam­ily at United MMA Hawaii, which is owned by them.</p>
    <p>Mar­tial arts are a fam­ily af­fair for the Lees, with all four sib­lings, in­clud­ing Chris­tian, 22, One’s light­weight world cham­pion, coached by their par­ents, Sin­ga­pore-born Ken and his South Korean wife Jewelz.</p>
    <p>Her younger sis­ter Vic­to­ria, 16, is also fol­low­ing in her sib­lings’ foot­steps, sign­ing with One last month.</p>
    <p>Other fight­ers have re­turned to ac­tion af­ter their preg­nan­cies. Ul­ti­mate Fight­ing Cham­pi­onship (UFC) women’s strawweigh­t Macken­zie Dern re­turned to the Oc­tagon in Oc­to­ber last year, four months af­ter giv­ing birth to her daughter, Moa.</p>
