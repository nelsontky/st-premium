    <p>JJ LIN SHARES SUN­RISE FROM $9.5M TAIPEI APART­MENT:</p>
    <p>Tai­wan-based Sin­ga­porean singer-song­writer JJ Lin (right) woke up to a spec­tac­u­lar sun­rise on</p>
    <p>Sun­day, and did what most peo­ple would do – he took a photo and posted it on so­cial media (far right).</p>
    <p>What caught the at­ten­tion of ne­ti­zens was not the fact that the In­sta­gram post was tagged #nofil­ter, but that the stun­ning view is al­legedly from his NT$203 mil­lion (S$9.5 mil­lion) lux­ury apart­ment.</p>
    <p>Eagle-eyed fans fa­mil­iar with the area de­duced that the view is from the</p>
    <p>25th-floor unit he pur­chased last year in Taipei’s Neihu district.</p>
    <p>Con­sid­ered one of the posh­est res­i­den­tial ad­dresses in the neigh­bour­hood, the apart­ment mea­sures about 685 sq m. That is about the size of 10 Hous­ing Board three-room flats.</p>
    <p>He re­port­edly has a sec­ond unit there, as well as a num­ber of other mil­lion-dol­lar prop­er­ties in Taipei, in­clud­ing a house worth NT$63 mil­lion in the Da’an district.</p>
    <p>Be­sides col­lect­ing prop­er­ties like they are Mo­nop­oly houses, the suc­cess­ful singer also has a pas­sion for fancy cars.</p>
    <p>Like his car-crazy singer pals Jay Chou and Jimmy Lin, he has amassed quite a fleet, in­clud­ing a Fer­rari GTC4Lusso and</p>
    <p>458 Spe­ciale, a McLaren 720S, a BMW M2 and a cool Volk­swa­gen Cal­i­for­nia Ocean camper van. Well, as he is said to be tak­ing home NT$300 mil­lion an­nu­ally from his mu­sic as well as side hus­tles, such as his cafe and bou­tique ven­tures, he can cer­tainly af­ford to splurge a lit­tle.</p>
