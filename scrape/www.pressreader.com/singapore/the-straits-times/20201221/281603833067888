    <p>When the Covid-19 out­break be­gan in Jan­uary, Mr Ab­dul Wahab, 54, a nurse clin­i­cian in the in­ten­sive care unit (ICU) at the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases (NCID) re­frained from vis­it­ing his el­derly mother so as not to ex­pose her to the virus.</p>
    <p>He looked for­ward to hug­ging her once it ended.</p>
    <p>When his mother de­vel­oped heart fail­ure in Oc­to­ber, he was stuck be­tween want­ing to be by her side, and keep­ing her safe from any­thing that might be on him.</p>
    <p>But he did not ex­pect that she would die last month. Mr Wahab had seen his mother just three times this year – twice in hospi­tal and once at home.</p>
    <p>For their un­selfish ded­i­ca­tion to their jobs de­spite the per­sonal sac­ri­fices, Mr Wahab and four oth­ers have been nom­i­nated to rep­re­sent the army of peo­ple on the front lines of the Covid-19 bat­tle as The Straits Times Sin­ga­porean of the Year.</p>
    <p>The virus kept Mr Wahab on his toes as he en­coun­tered new clin­i­cal chal­lenges de­spite hav­ing worked in ICUs since 1996. He had to learn to use the ex­tra-cor­po­real mem­brane oxy­gena­tion ma­chine, which took over the func­tions of the hearts and lungs of the sick­est pa­tients.</p>
    <p>For Mr Benson Ng, 32, who used to work in food re­tail, the men­ace of Covid-19 hit too close to home when his 58-year-old fa­ther fell ill with the virus in March.</p>
    <p>His fa­ther re­ceived oxy­gen ther­apy as he was closely mon­i­tored in the ICU for a few days of his twoweek hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion. Even af­ter dis­charge, he suf­fered sleep­less nights and mus­cle pain for about a month.</p>
    <p>See­ing how ill his fa­ther be­came com­pelled Mr Ng to sign up in May to be a swab­ber for Covid-19 tests.</p>
    <p>“The ex­pe­ri­ence that my fam­ily went through made me very de­ter­mined to do some­thing to fight the virus,” said Mr Ng.</p>
    <p>From May to Au­gust, he was de­ployed in dor­mi­to­ries, tak­ing nasal swabs from mi­grant work­ers. Since Septem­ber, he has been part of a rov­ing team that car­ries out rou­tine test­ing in dorms and for hawker stall­hold­ers, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>The other faces in the bat­tle against the pan­demic are Mr Nigel Quek, com­mand­ing of­fi­cer at Cer­tis’ In­te­grated Quar­an­tine Or­der Ser­vices; Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong, co-de­vel­oper of Sin­ga­pore’s sole Sars-CoV-2 vac­cine now un­der­go­ing hu­man tri­als; and Pro­fes­sor Leo Yee Sin, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of NCID.</p>
    <p>Mr Quek, 34, who su­per­vises hun­dreds of quar­an­tine or­der agents in Cer­tis, said it was grat­i­fy­ing to see his of­fi­cers step up, es­pe­cially dur­ing the peak of the pan­demic here, when they had to serve high num­bers of quar­an­tine or­ders in the dorms.</p>
    <p>When Mr Quek was swamped with man­ag­ing de­ploy­ments, some of his of­fi­cers stepped up to lead dorm op­er­a­tions for him.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cers – whom Mr Quek code-named “Guardians” – shed their usual stern de­meanour and did their best to re­as­sure mi­grant work­ers, many of whom could not un­der­stand English and were afraid.</p>
    <p>“Most of the work­ers had never used a ther­mome­ter be­fore. We built rap­port with a worker who could con­verse in English to help us trans­late our in­struc­tions,” said Mr Quek.</p>
    <p>The work of a quar­an­tine or­der agent in­cludes is­su­ing quar­an­tine or­ders, check­ing if homes are suit­able for quar­an­tine, and es­cort­ing per­sons un­der quar­an­tine to gov­ern­ment quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Serv­ing quar­an­tine or­ders was the first de­ploy­ment for some new aux­il­iary po­lice of­fi­cers, said Mr Quek.</p>
    <p>“The award nom­i­na­tion is a tes­ta­ment to all Cer­tis front-lin­ers’ ef­forts to brave the un­known, and show pro­fes­sion­al­ism and care in our op­er­a­tions and to the peo­ple un­der quar­an­tine,” he added.</p>
    <p>Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School’s Prof Ooi, who spe­cialises in emerg­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases, raced against time to de­velop a vac­cine for the new coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Where vac­cine de­vel­op­ment typ­i­cally takes five to 10 years, he and his team of 12 post­doc­toral fel­lows and re­search as­sis­tants have had a hec­tic nine months work­ing with Amer­i­can phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany Arc­turus Ther­a­peu­tics to study the virus and con­duct var­i­ous vac­cine-re­lated stud­ies si­mul­ta­ne­ously.</p>
    <p>They are now analysing the blood sam­ples of par­tic­i­pants in phase one and two clin­i­cal tri­als, and the fi­nal phase of clin­i­cal tri­als for the Lu­nar-Cov19 vac­cine is likely to start be­fore the end of the year.</p>
    <p>“I un­der­stand the pres­sure to suc­ceed. What­ever we are do­ing is not just for the sake of science, but to help Sin­ga­pore get out of this pan­demic. We re­ally had to put our best foot for­ward,” said Prof Ooi.</p>
    <p>He is also the co-founder of a biotech com­pany that has de­vel­oped a Covid-19 an­ti­body drug, now in phase three tri­als, that could help pa­tients re­cover faster.</p>
    <p>NCID, which be­came the nerve cen­tre of Sin­ga­pore’s bat­tle against its big­gest pan­demic, less than six months af­ter it of­fi­cially opened in Septem­ber last year, is helmed by Prof Leo.</p>
    <p>“We de­signed NCID with the no­tion that it will han­dle an out­break. It was just a mat­ter of when. But I will say that we didn’t re­ally an­tic­i­pate such a quick and suc­ces­sive en­coun­ter­ing of emerg­ing in­fec­tions,” she said.</p>
    <p>Early last year saw a spike in measles cases and Sin­ga­pore’s first case of mon­key­pox in­fec­tion. Then came the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The in­sti­tu­tion was de­signed to be able to scale up its ca­pac­ity from 330 beds to more than 500 when nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the pan­demic, man­power was ramped up from about 600 to more than 2,000, with re­in­force­ments com­ing from Tan Tock Seng Hospi­tal and other in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>Ad­mit­ting the ma­jor­ity of hos­pi­talised Covid-19 cases to NCID en­abled the in­sti­tu­tion to “know the en­emy”, Prof Leo said. They could “swiftly char­ac­terise the disease pat­tern, sup­port in-depth re­search, and set up an ex­tremely valu­able re­search co­hort” for the coun­try.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the cen­tre’s Covid-19 re­search work­group dis­cov­ered early that pa­tients tend to shed a high vi­ral load at the on­set of in­fec­tion, even when they are asymp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>“This find­ing meant our preven­tive mea­sures had to be broader – ev­ery­one was told to wear masks and prac­tise safe dis­tanc­ing.”</p>
    <p>Things are look­ing up as all Sin­ga­pore­ans and long-term res­i­dents will be able to get vac­ci­nated by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>But Prof Leo says the NCID’s job is not yet done. “There are still a lot of un­knowns about the disease, such as post-Covid-19 syn­drome and re­ports of re-in­fec­tions.”</p>
    <p>Post-Covid-19 or “long Covid” refers to long-last­ing health ef­fects of the virus that can last months or pos­si­bly even years.</p>
    <p>Prof Leo added: “We don’t know whether the virus will evolve and how the evo­lu­tions will af­fect us... We have to con­tinue re­search­ing and study­ing this.”</p>
