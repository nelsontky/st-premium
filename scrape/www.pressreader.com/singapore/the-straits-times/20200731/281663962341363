    <p>Nine cy­ber se­cu­rity soft­ware firms have been awarded up to $1 mil­lion each to build sys­tems to help Sin­ga­pore shore up the de­fence of crit­i­cal sec­tors in­clud­ing en­ergy, health­care and de­fence, as well as emerg­ing ar­eas like driver­less ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>The firms were se­lected from 87 sub­mis­sions in the sec­ond call for in­no­va­tion by the Cy­ber Se­cu­rity Agency (CSA) of Sin­ga­pore and lo­cally based ven­ture cap­i­tal firm TNB Ven­tures.</p>
    <p>The se­lected firms are lo­cally based Group-IB, Se­cure-IC, Acro­nis, Amaris.AI, Scan­tist, Se­cureAge and In­sid­erSe­cu­rity, as well as multi­na­tional firms EY Ad­vi­sory and Emer­son.</p>
    <p>CSA chief ex­ec­u­tive David Koh told The Straits Times: “The call for in­no­va­tion fills a spe­cific gap – it brings to­gether (en­ter­prise com­puter) sys­tem own­ers which face real-world chal­lenges with tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies which have in­no­va­tive so­lu­tions.”</p>
    <p>The nine firms will de­velop ca­pa­bil­i­ties such as cryp­to­graphic and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) sys­tems to se­cure data and de­tect threats for the sys­tem own­ers in­clud­ing SingHealth’s IT ven­dor In­te­grated Health In­for­ma­tion Sys­tems, en­ergy firm YTL Pow­erSer­aya, and port op­er­a­tor PSA Cor­po­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>They will also de­velop pro­tec­tion for smart na­tion projects like driver­less ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Group-IB will be de­vel­op­ing an AI­driven cy­ber in­ves­ti­ga­tion soft­ware to help law en­force­ment of­fi­cers un­cover hid­den con­nec­tions in the Dark Web, to thwart cy­ber crimes tar­get­ing crit­i­cal sec­tors in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Said Group-IB’s pro­ject lead Shafique Da­wood: “The col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween pri­vate cy­ber se­cu­rity com­pa­nies and the Govern­ment is es­sen­tial in strength­en­ing Sin­ga­pore’s cy­ber se­cu­rity pos­ture.”</p>
    <p>Some of these firms will also up­date the safe­guards of decades-old in­dus­trial sys­tems in crit­i­cal sec­tors like en­ergy, health­care and de­fence.</p>
    <p>These sys­tems may not be the most pre­pared for cy­ber at­tacks as they were cre­ated decades ago un­der a men­tal­ity that they need not be se­cured as they were “air gapped”.</p>
    <p>Air gap­ping secures a sys­tem by keep­ing it com­pletely un­con­nected to the In­ter­net or other un­se­cured net­works.</p>
    <p>How­ever, rapid dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion over the past decade has added In­ter­net con­nec­tiv­ity to many of these sys­tems.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, equip­ment is now re­motely mon­i­tored as part of pre­ven­tive main­te­nance. The trou­bleshoot­ing of faulty equip­ment is also mostly done re­motely over the In­ter­net by third-party en­gi­neer­ing teams.</p>
    <p>The stakes are high, as any dis­rup­tion to these sys­tems means that crit­i­cal ser­vices, in­clud­ing the sup­ply of en­ergy and pub­lic trans­porta­tion, can­not be de­liv­ered to cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh said: “Some (of the so­lu­tions be­ing de­vel­oped) have al­ready gar­nered in­ter­est from in­vestors and po­ten­tial cus­tomers from di­verse sec­tors. This is a pos­i­tive start and we hope to see these cut­ting-edge so­lu­tions make an im­pact not just in Sin­ga­pore but re­gion­ally and even glob­ally.”</p>
    <p>The win­ning so­lu­tions must be ready for test­ing and de­ploy­ment within 24 months from now.</p>
    <p>These stepped-up mea­sures, such as the call for in­no­va­tion, fol­low the largest data breach in­volv­ing the per­sonal data of 1.5 mil­lion SingHealth pa­tients, in­clud­ing that of Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong, in 2018.</p>
    <p>Ev­i­dence shared with a Com­mit­tee of In­quiry into the cy­ber at­tack re­vealed that hack­ers had ex­ploited an open link, set up tem­po­rar­ily for data­base mi­gra­tion to a new cloud-based sys­tem, to ac­cess the health­care group’s elec­tronic med­i­cal records sys­tem.</p>
    <p>BRIDG­ING THE GAP</p>
    <p>The call for in­no­va­tion fills a spe­cific gap – it brings to­gether (en­ter­prise com­puter) sys­tem own­ers which face real-world chal­lenges with tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies which have in­no­va­tive so­lu­tions.</p>
