    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Fake news cam­paigns or­ches­trated by pro-Russia ac­tors are thriv­ing ahead of the United States elec­tions, stok­ing con­cerns of a re­peat of the largescale in­ter­fer­ence that dis­rupted 2016’s bal­lot, said cy­ber se­cu­rity firm FireEye.</p>
    <p>Among the more prom­i­nent is an op­er­a­tion dubbed Ghost­writer be­cause its par­tic­i­pants mas­quer­ade as jour­nal­ists or an­a­lysts to push fab­ri­cated con­tent in me­dia friendly to Russia across the Baltic region, de­signed to un­set­tle the Nato pres­ence there.</p>
    <p>The group of ac­tors, in op­er­a­tion for years, has in re­cent months dis­sem­i­nated huge vol­umes of tar­geted mis­in­for­ma­tion across Poland, Lithua­nia and Latvia, where hun­dreds of Nato troops are sta­tioned.</p>
    <p>In two no­table in­stances, they fab­ri­cated a tran­script and at­trib­uted quotes to an Amer­i­can com­mand­ing gen­eral sta­tioned in Ger­many, be­moan­ing the state of Baltic and Pol­ish mil­i­tary forces.</p>
    <p>An­other fal­si­fied a memo from Nato’s sec­re­tary-gen­eral declar­ing that troops would leave the region be­cause of an out­break of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>At least one re­port – cir­cu­lated among Rus­sian-backed me­dia out­lets – claimed in­fected Cana­dian sol­diers have been spread­ing the virus in Latvia, which Cana­dian and Nato com­man­ders re­buffed in May.</p>
    <p>“One of our big­gest con­cerns is that they are devel­op­ing a method that could be lever­aged dur­ing the elec­tion,” said Mr John Hultquist, se­nior di­rec­tor at Man­di­ant Threat In­tel­li­gence, a FireEye unit.</p>
    <p>The meth­ods in­clude plant­ing fake sto­ries on le­git­i­mate web­sites that have been un­know­ingly com­pro­mised and us­ing made-up per­sonas to push sto­ries across plat­forms, the firm said.</p>
    <p>The dis­in­for­ma­tion ef­forts are a re­fine­ment of what Russia tried to do in 2016. The fake so­cial me­dia ac­counts and bots used by the In­ter­net Re­search Agency and other Russia-backed groups to am­plify false ar­ti­cles have proved rel­a­tively easy to stamp out.</p>
    <p>But it is far more dif­fi­cult to stop the dis­sem­i­na­tion of such ar­ti­cles that ap­pear on web­sites that seem le­git­i­mate, ac­cord­ing to out­side ex­perts. Face­book has be­gun la­belling sto­ries that ap­pear on state­spon­sored news sites like RT and Sput­nik. But it is harder for the so­cial me­dia com­pa­nies to iden­tify and la­bel news ar­ti­cles that are posted on con­spir­acy-minded sites, ac­cord­ing to ex­perts.</p>
    <p>The dis­clo­sures, re­ported by The As­so­ci­ated Press (AP), sin­gled out an in­for­ma­tion agency reg­is­tered in Russia called In­foRos that runs sev­eral web­sites that “have lever­aged the pan­demic to pro­mote anti-Western ob­jec­tives and spread dis­in­for­ma­tion”.</p>
    <p>AP iden­ti­fied two peo­ple who had served in Russia’s mil­i­tary in­tel­li­gence ser­vice as hav­ing held lead­er­ship roles at In­foRos.</p>
    <p>“One of the things we see with these ac­tors, we know they are go­ing into sim­i­lar web­sites and post­ing fic­ti­tious nar­ra­tives, so it’s a very sim­i­lar op­er­a­tion in some re­gards,” Mr Hultquist said.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can in­tel­li­gence and law en­force­ment of­fi­cials have been in­ves­ti­gat­ing pos­si­ble Rus­sian in­ter­fer­ence in the up­com­ing pres­i­den­tial elec­tions since ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Bloomberg re­ported they were try­ing to de­ter­mine if Russia was try­ing to un­der­mine Demo­cratic con­tender Joe Bi­den and warned that elec­tion in­ter­fer­ence this year “could be more brazen” than in 2016.</p>
