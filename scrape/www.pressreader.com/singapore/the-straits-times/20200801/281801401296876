    <p>• US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has no power to change the date of the Nov 3 elec­tion by ex­ec­u­tive or­der, but Con­gress could change the date if it wanted to.</p>
    <p>It just does not want to. But if it did, here is how it would work: The Con­sti­tu­tion gives states the power to choose the “times, places and man­ner” of elec­tions, but Con­gress can set na­tional stan­dards.</p>
    <p>Since 1845, Con­gress has set elec­tion day as the first Tues­day af­ter the first Mon­day i n Novem­ber. That date is a ves­tige of an agri­cul­tural econ­omy when au­tumn har­vests were com­pleted and Tues­days did not in­ter­fere with trips to the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery once in a while, some­one pro­poses a change. The Week­end Vot­ing Act – spon­sored by Se­na­tor Jack Reed of Rhode Is­land and Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Louise Slaugh­ter of New York, both Democrats – would have moved the elec­tion to the week­end af­ter the first Fri­day in Novem­ber. The Bill died in the last Con­gress with­out a vote.</p>
    <p>It would be dif­fi­cult to push the elec­tions back much fur­ther with­out hit­ting le­gal and con­sti­tu­tional dead­lines. States need time to com­plete their of­fi­cial counts and cer­tify the re­sults be­fore ap­point­ing mem­bers of the Elec­toral Col­lege, called elec­tors.</p>
    <p>By law, the Elec­toral Col­lege meets on “the first Mon­day af­ter the sec­ond Wed­nes­day in De­cem­ber”. This year, that day is Dec 14. If no elec­tion has been held, it would be up to state leg­is­la­tures to de­cide how to cast their elec­toral votes and they could choose any­one.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal step is for Con­gress to re­ceive the Elec­toral Col­lege votes. That usu­ally hap­pens on Jan 6, but Con­gress has changed the date in the past.</p>
    <p>If there is no clear win­ner by then, the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives chooses the pres­i­dent from among the top three can­di­dates with elec­toral votes, with each state del­e­ga­tion get­ting one vote. The Se­nate chooses the vice-pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, there is one dead­line that can­not be moved with­out a con­sti­tu­tional amend­ment. In­au­gu­ra­tion day is Jan 20, 2021. Mr Trump’s term ends at noon that day, whether there has been an elec­tion or not.</p>
    <p>If no pres­i­dent or vice-pres­i­dent is cho­sen by then, the Speaker of the House be­comes pres­i­dent. That is now Demo­crat Nancy Pelosi, but there will be an elec­tion for a new Speaker in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>But if a catas­tro­phe were to some­how pre­vent the elec­tion of new mem­bers of Con­gress, the pres­i­dent pro tem of the Se­nate would move to the White House.</p>
    <p>That is Iowa Se­na­tor Chuck Grass­ley. He was re-elected to a six-year term in 2016 and would be the one per­son in the line of suc­ces­sion whose el­i­gi­bil­ity does not rely on an elec­tion held in 2020.</p>
