    <p>SAN AN­TO­NIO • The Los An­ge­les Lak­ers know that it is im­pos­si­ble to play like Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) cham­pi­ons ev­ery game this sea­son, and what mat­ters most to their coach Frank Vo­gel is to grind out the “ugly wins”.</p>
    <p>An­thony Davis had 34 points and 11 re­bounds, and the Lak­ers ral­lied at the end with a 9-0 run to de­feat the hosts San An­to­nio Spurs 109-103 on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“We per­sisted through our strug­gles,” Vo­gel said. “That’s go­ing to hap­pen from time to time. In a 72-game sea­son, you are go­ing to have some wins that are uglier than oth­ers.</p>
    <p>“We knew com­ing into this sea­son, with the quick turn­around, there was go­ing to be some ugly nights.</p>
    <p>“The key is to find a way to win when you are not at your best.”</p>
    <p>LeBron James had 26 points, 11 re­bounds, 10 as­sists and two steals for the Lak­ers, who beat the Spurs for the se­cond time in three days.</p>
    <p>They also earned a 121-107 win at San An­to­nio on Wed­nes­day be­hind 26 points from James.</p>
    <p>Den­nis Schroder added 15 points and Kyle Kuzma con­trib­uted 11 for the Lak­ers. Montrezl Har­rell grabbed 11 boards for Los An­ge­les.</p>
    <p>Kel­don John­son led the Spurs with his ca­reer-high of 26 points, while DeMar DeRozan col­lected 23 points, nine re­bounds and seven as­sists.</p>
    <p>Rudy Gay chipped in 15 points, De­jounte Mur­ray scored 12 and Patty Mills scored 10.</p>
    <p>It was John­son’s only fourth game of 20-plus points in two sea­sons. Only Hall of Famer Tim Dun­can had more 20-point ef­forts through his first 25 ca­reer games with the Spurs, get­ting six dur­ing his rookie sea­son.</p>
    <p>“He’s a com­peti­tor,” San An­to­nio coach Gregg Popovich said of John­son. “He’s a fine young player and he’s go­ing to have a great ca­reer. That’s about all I can say. He’s been won­der­ful.”</p>
    <p>A tip-in by Kuzma and a bucket in­side by James put the Lak­ers up 107-103 with 28.6 sec­onds re­main­ing.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Der­rick White mis­fired on a jumper, Davis sealed the win with a pair of free throws.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther team led by more than seven points.</p>
    <p>Un­like in Wed­nes­day’s loss, the Spurs were able to keep pace with the Lak­ers early.</p>
    <p>“We played a heck of a bas­ket­ball team, and we were a good bas­ket­ball team tonight also,” Popovich said. “So, I was happy with their play.”</p>
    <p>A 16-6 surge early in the third quar­ter boosted the Spurs to a 73-70 ad­van­tage af­ter a three­p­ointer by John­son with 6min 47sec re­main­ing.</p>
    <p>The two teams ex­changed leads un­til a three-pointer by Gay and a jumper by DeRozan lifted the Spurs to an 85-81 lead head­ing into the fourth quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the Lak­ers shot 40.6 per cent and the Spurs hit 42.4 per cent of their shots.</p>
    <p>“Their game plan tweaked,” Kuzma said. “They added a lit­tle bit of a dif­fer­ent el­e­ment for us. We had to ad­just down the stretch.”</p>
    <p>Spurs cen­tre LaMar­cus Aldridge (knee) missed his se­cond con­sec­u­tive con­test, while the Lak­ers lost guard Ken­tavi­ous Cald­well-Pope, who fin­ished with 11 points in 17 min­utes, in the third quar­ter with an an­kle sprain.</p>
    <p>Lak­ers re­serve guard Alex Caruso, who did not travel with the team, was side­lined for the third straight game re­port­edly due to health and safety pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>IT NEEDN’T BE PRETTY</p>
    <p>We per­sisted through our strug­gles. That’s go­ing to hap­pen from time to time. In a 72-game sea­son, you are go­ing to have some wins that are uglier than oth­ers.</p>
    <p>FRANK VO­GEL, LA Lak­ers coach, who is fine with his team not play­ing like cham­pi­ons in ev­ery game.</p>
