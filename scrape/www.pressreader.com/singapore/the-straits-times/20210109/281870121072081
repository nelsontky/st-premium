    <p>• The US am­bas­sador to the United Na­tions Kelly Craft will visit Tai­wan next week for meet­ings with se­nior lead­ers, Tai­wan’s gov­ern­ment and the US mis­sion to the UN said, prompt­ing China to warn that they were play­ing with fire.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing, which claims the self­gov­erned is­land as its own ter­ri­tory, has been an­gered by stepped-up sup­port for Tai­wan from the out­go­ing Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, in­clud­ing trips to Taipei by top US of­fi­cials, fur­ther strain­ing Sino-US ties.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese fighter jets ap­proached the is­land in Au­gust and Septem­ber dur­ing the last two vis­its by US of­fi­cials – by Sec­re­tary of Health and Hu­man Ser­vices Alex Azar and Un­der Sec­re­tary of State for Eco­nomic Growth, En­ergy, and the En­vi­ron­ment Keith Krach, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing her trip, the am­bas­sador will re­in­force the US gov­ern­ment’s strong and on­go­ing sup­port for Tai­wan’s in­ter­na­tional space in ac­cord with the US one-China pol­icy that is guided by the Tai­wan Re­la­tions Act, the three US-PRC joint com­mu­niques, and the Six As­sur­ances to Tai­wan,” the US mis­sion to the UN said in a state­ment on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>PRC refers to the Peo­ple’s Re­pub­lic of China.</p>
    <p>Ms Craft will be in Tai­wan from Jan 13 to 15, it added.</p>
    <p>While the United States, like most coun­tries, has no for­mal diplo­matic ties with Tai­wan, it is the is­land’s strong­est in­ter­na­tional backer and arms sup­plier, be­ing obliged to help pro­vide Tai­wan with the means to de­fend it­self un­der the 1979 Tai­wan Re­la­tions Act.</p>
    <p>China said it is firmly op­posed to the visit. “We wish to re­mind the United States that who­ever plays with fire will burn him­self. The United States will pay a heavy price for its wrong ac­tion,” China’s UN mis­sion said.</p>
    <p>“China strongly urges the United States to stop its crazy provo­ca­tion, stop cre­at­ing new dif­fi­cul­ties for China-US re­la­tions and the two coun­tries’ co­op­er­a­tion in the United Na­tions, and stop go­ing fur­ther on the wrong path.”</p>
    <p>Taipei yes­ter­day said Ms Craft, whom it called a “staunch friend”, would meet Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing-wen and For­eign Min­is­ter Joseph Wu.</p>
    <p>The visit is highly sym­bolic as Tai­wan is not a UN mem­ber, be­cause of ob­jec­tions by China, which views the is­land as one of its prov­inces and not a coun­try, and that only Bei­jing has a right to speak for Tai­wan on the in­ter­na­tional stage.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan says that right be­longs to its demo­crat­i­cally elected gov­ern­ment, not China.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, index providers MSCI, FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones In­dices have said they would re­move three Chi­nese tele­com com­pa­nies from their bench­marks, part of a widen­ing fall­out from a US in­vest­ment ban that has bat­tered their share prices.</p>
    <p>The dele­tions of China Mo­bile, China Tele­com and China Uni­com Hong Kong add to a raft of Chi­nese firms al­ready dropped from in­dexes be­cause of the ban and will force index track­ing funds to sell their stocks.</p>
