    <p>This week, there are two films about homes that are not quite the dream prop­er­ties they ap­pear to be.</p>
    <p>The sci­ence-fic­tion hor­ror work Vi­var­ium (M18, 98 min­utes, opens to­day, ) stars Jesse</p>
    <p>Eisen­berg and Imo­gen Poots, both in this col­umn a few weeks ago for the drama The Art Of Self De­fense (2019). In this film, they are Tom and Gemma, an av­er­age cou­ple look­ing for a starter home when they chance upon Yonder, a de­vel­op­ment the agent prom­ises will be their “for­ever home”.</p>
    <p>In this icy satire of the prop­erty lad­der, Yonder does turn out to be their for­ever home – just not in the way they ex­pect.</p>
    <p>Of late, Hong Kong has been the place for bit­ter come­dies about the prop­erty mar­ket. In Dream Home (2011), a woman mur­ders her way to a pro­gres­sively nicer flat; in Room With A View (2019), a family goes on a ram­page when a mil­lion­aire’s ob­nox­ious bill­board ob­structs their view of the sea, slash­ing the value of their apart­ment.</p>
    <p>In Vi­var­ium, a mostly Ir­ish pro­duc­tion se­lected for the Cannes Film Fes­ti­val last year, the tone is much less lit­eral. Tom and Gemma find them­selves in a Twi­light Zone land­scape of the sur­real in which ev­ery­day ac­tions yield bizarre re­sults.</p>
    <p>Be­sides re­veal­ing home own­er­ship’s po­ten­tial to be a night­mar­ish bur­den, the story asks cyn­i­cal ques­tions about con­sumerism and sub­ur­bia, and even darker ones about par­ent­hood.</p>
    <p>South Korean drama Par­a­site (2019), win­ner of the Best Pic­ture Os­car, also makes a point about one so­cial class feed­ing on an­other in a man­sion on a hill. In this bleak, un­set­tling story, par­a­sitism is about as real as it can be, and kept within the em­brace of the family.</p>
    <p>The Rental (NC16, 93 min­utes, opens to­day, ) ad­dresses an­other sub­ur­ban fear: In Airbnb homes, guests are at the mercy of the owner’s moral code.</p>
    <p>What sets this apart from other cau­tion­ary tales about so­cial me­dia and the gig econ­omy is style. Imag­ine a cabin-of-ter­ror slasher movie that avoids tropes, such as jump scares, cute teen char­ac­ters or a vil­lain whose mo­tive is tritely la­belled as “in­san­ity”.</p>
    <p>You might end up with this movie writ­ten by Amer­i­can Joe Swan­berg, vet­eran of the so-called “mum­blecore” scene. It is helmed by an ac­tor mak­ing his di­rec­to­rial debut, Dave Franco. Yes, that Dave Franco, who worked with Swan­berg in the Net­flix drama-com­edy se­ries about sex, Easy (2016 to 2019), but who is known mostly for ap­pear­ing in come­dies (21 Jump Street, 2012;</p>
    <p>The Dis­as­ter Artist, 2017).</p>
    <p>Four adults from San Fran­cisco, some flush with tech money, find a dream Airbnb rental on the coast for a week­end get­away. As the hours wear on, how­ever, fric­tion in the group (Dan Stevens and Ali­son Brie as one cou­ple, and Sheila Vand and Jeremy Allen White as an­other) gnaws at their sense of well-be­ing. A se­cret dis­cov­ered within the home trig­gers a chain of deadly events.</p>
    <p>There is a lot to ad­mire about a film that does away with ter­ri­ble slasher tropes, such as jump scares, and re­places them with nat­u­ral­is­tic dia­logue. There is a sur­pris­ing amount of plot to get through for a Swan­berg pro­duc­tion, though, and Franco strug­gles to give the story feel­ings of ten­sion and re­lease.</p>
    <p>For a film that wears its nat­u­ral­ism far more eas­ily, look to In­done­sian in­die drama Humba Dreams (2019, NC16, 75 min­utes, Net­flix, ). Part road trip, part com­ing-of-age story, it fol­lows Martin (J.S. Khairen), a Jakarta film stu­dent who re­turns home to the is­land of Sumba, in the east of the coun­try, to set­tle af­fairs after the death of his fa­ther.</p>
    <p>It is a jour­ney to a quiet, parched land­scape dif­fer­ent from that of packed, trop­i­cal Java.</p>
    <p>Martin’s peo­ple speak their own lan­guage and prac­tise a mix of Chris­tian­ity and an­i­mism. Spir­its speak to the liv­ing through shamans and in dreams, re­mind­ing them of debts un­paid and prom­ises un­kept.</p>
    <p>Martin’s quest takes him around the is­land’s towns and vil­lages, al­low­ing him to meet a range of lo­cals, in­clud­ing those whose daugh­ters and hus­bands joined the tide of Sum­banese seek­ing jobs in Malaysia, only to dis­ap­pear.</p>
    <p>Writer-di­rec­tor Riri Riza’s back-to-home-town setup lets au­di­ences see an older world through the eyes of some­one who has a foot each in the mod­ern and the an­cient.</p>
    <p>It is not the fresh­est idea in the world, but in this heart­felt story about a young man com­ing to terms with his fa­ther’s legacy, it works.</p>
    <p>Other films open­ing this week in­clude family an­i­ma­tion Big­foot Family (PG, 88 min­utes, opens to­day), the fol­low-up to Son Of Big­foot (2017). In this eco-ad­ven­ture, Big­foot at­tempts to stop an Alaskan drilling com­pany, but when he dis­ap­pears, his son, mother and a troop of an­i­mal friends stage a search.</p>
    <p>In South Korean thriller In­truder (PG13, 102 min­utes, opens to­day), the sis­ter of ar­chi­tect Seo-jin (Kim Mu-yeol), Yoo-jin (Song Ji-hyo), re­turns after a 25-year dis­ap­pear­ance. The prodi­gal daugh­ter, how­ever, comes home laden with se­crets.</p>
