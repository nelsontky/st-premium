    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The US econ­omy con­tracted at its steep­est pace on record in the sec­ond quar­ter as the Covid-19 pan­demic shat­tered con­sumer and busi­ness spend­ing, and a nascent re­cov­ery is un­der threat from a resur­gence in coro­n­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>Gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) shrank 9.5 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter from the first, a drop that equals an an­nu­alised pace of 32.9 per cent, the deep­est de­cline in out­put since the govern­ment started keep­ing records in 1947. The drop in GDP was more than triple the pre­vi­ous all-time de­cline of 10 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter of 1958.</p>
    <p>The bulk of the his­toric plunge in GDP re­ported by the Com­merce Depart­ment yes­ter­day oc­curred in April, when ac­tiv­ity al­most ground to an abrupt halt after restau­rants, bars and fac­to­ries, among oth­ers, were shut­tered in mid-March to slow the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The col­lapse in GDP and fal­ter­ing re­cov­ery put pres­sure on the White House and Congress to agree on a sec­ond stim­u­lus pack­age.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, whose opin­ion poll num­bers have tanked as he strug­gles to man­age the pan­demic, eco­nomic cri­sis and protests over racial in­jus­tice three months be­fore the Nov 3 elec­tion, said on Wednes­day that he was in no hurry. “This is hard to swal­low,” said fi­nance pro­fes­sor Ja­son Reed of the Univer­sity of Notre Dame’s Men­doza Col­lege of Busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“Right now, the Amer­i­can econ­omy is speed­ing to­ward a fis­cal cliff. Not only do we need Amer­i­cans to take se­ri­ous ac­tion pre­vent­ing the spread of the dis­ease, but we also need Congress to agree on an­other stim­u­lus pack­age, and quickly.”</p>
    <p>The econ­omy con­tracted at a 5 per cent pace in the first quar­ter. It fell into re­ces­sion in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mists polled by Reuters had fore­cast GDP plung­ing at a 34.1 per cent rate in the April-June quar­ter.</p>
    <p>The Com­merce Depart­ment’s Bureau of Eco­nomic Anal­y­sis, which com­piles the GDP report, at­trib­uted the tum­ble in out­put to mea­sures taken in March and April in re­sponse to Covid-19, say­ing they “led to rapid shifts in ac­tiv­ity”.</p>
    <p>Though ac­tiv­ity picked up start­ing in May, mo­men­tum has slowed amid a resur­gence in new cases of the re­s­pi­ra­tory ill­ness, es­pe­cially in the densely pop­u­lated South and West re­gions, where the au­thor­i­ties in hard-hit ar­eas are clos­ing busi­nesses again or paus­ing re­open­ings. That has tem­pered hopes of a sharp re­bound in growth in the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Fed­eral Re­serve chair­man Jerome Powell on Wednes­day ac­knowl­edged the slow­down in ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>The US cen­tral bank kept in­ter­est rates near zero and pledged to con­tinue pump­ing money into the econ­omy. Stocks on Wall Street opened lower. The dol­lar was steady against a bas­ket of cur­ren­cies. US Trea­sury prices rose.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mists say that with­out the his­toric fis­cal pack­age of nearly US$3 tril­lion (S$4.13 tril­lion), the eco­nomic con­trac­tion would have been deeper.</p>
    <p>Cru­cial life­lines in the pan­demic, like the ex­tra US$600 in weekly un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits, are ex­pir­ing at a time when the eco­nomic re­cov­ery is show­ing signs of tee­ter­ing.</p>
    <p>Law­mak­ers are cur­rently de­bat­ing an­other stim­u­lus pack­age to sup­port busi­nesses and the un­em­ployed, but the tim­ing of the Bill is un­clear.</p>
    <p>Sup­port from Congress has buoyed the econ­omy i n re­cent months, and fur­ther ac­tion will be cru­cial in de­ter­min­ing the path of the re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate report yes­ter­day, the Labour Depart­ment said ini­tial claims for un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits in­creased 12,000 to a sea­son­ally ad­justed 1.43 mil­lion in the week that ended last Satur­day. A stag­ger­ing 30.2 mil­lion Amer­i­cans were re­ceiv­ing un­em­ploy­ment cheques in the week that ended on July 11.</p>
    <p>Con­sumer spend­ing, which ac­counts for more than two-thirds of the US econ­omy, plunged at a record 34.6 per cent rate last quar­ter.</p>
    <p>That fol­lowed a 6.9 per cent pace of de­cline in the Jan­uary-March pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness in­vest­ment tum­bled at a his­toric 27 per cent rate. It was pulled down by spend­ing on equip­ment, which col­lapsed at a 37.7 per cent rate.</p>
    <p>In­vest­ment i n equip­ment has now con­tracted for five straight quar­ters.</p>
    <p>The hous­ing mar­ket was not spared, with spend­ing on home­build­ing tum­bling at 38.7 per cent rate.</p>
    <p>But govern­ment spend­ing rose at a 2.7 per cent rate, thanks to the his­toric stim­u­lus pack­age.</p>
    <p>Though a smaller im­port bill helped to nar­row the trade deficit and was pos­i­tive for GDP, it cut in­ven­to­ries, lead­ing to a draw­down of stocks by busi­nesses that sub­tracted 3.98 per­cent­age points from GDP.</p>
