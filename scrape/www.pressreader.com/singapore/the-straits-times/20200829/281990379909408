    <p>• A South African con­ser­va­tion­ist has been killed by one of the two lions he hand-reared, his fam­ily has said.</p>
    <p>Mr West Mathew­son, 69, was walk­ing two white li­onesses on Wed­nes­day when one of the an­i­mals at­tacked and killed him with­out warn­ing. The in­ci­dent took place on the premises of the fam­ily-owned Lion Tree Top Lodge, in South Africa’s north­ern Lim­popo prov­ince.</p>
    <p>Known as “Un­cle West”, he had raised the lions since they were cubs and was used to in­ter­act­ing with them.</p>
    <p>Mr Mathew­son’s wife, Gill, 65, was driv­ing be­hind her hus­band when the lion at­tacked.</p>
    <p>“She tried her best to res­cue her hus­band, but was un­able to do so,” said a state­ment by fam­ily at­tor­ney Ma­rina Botha e-mailed to Agence France-Presse on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The lions have been tem­po­rar­ily moved to a fa­cil­ity while a de­ci­sion on their fi­nal des­ti­na­tion is made.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily said that they would be “re­leased into the best en­vi­ron­ment avail­able to them”.</p>
    <p>Mr Mathew­son and his wife had four sons and six grand­chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“The fam­ily is heart­bro­ken by the loss of their hus­band, fa­ther and grand­fa­ther,” the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>“They find com­fort and peace with the fact that he died while liv­ing his dream, be­ing in na­ture and with his lions that were so close to his heart.”</p>
