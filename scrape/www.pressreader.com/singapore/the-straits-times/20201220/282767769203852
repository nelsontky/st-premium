    <p>The fin­ish was head­ing to­wards a tie, with three play­ers in con­tention.</p>
    <p>Overnight leader Koh Deng­shan was fight­ing it out with Choo Tze Huang in the penul­ti­mate flight at La­guna Na­tional’s Masters course.</p>
    <p>Leader over Choo by two shots af­ter Thurs­day’s first round, Koh and his close buddy were tied with three holes to play in the pro­fes­sional sec­tion of the Pasir Ris Cen­tral Char­ity Golf event.</p>
    <p>But Choo, buoyed by birdies on the sec­ond, third, ninth and 11th holes, bagged an­other birdie on the chal­leng­ing par-four 16th to sneak ahead by one.</p>
    <p>And he was aware that Koh is a tough ri­val as the pair stood on the tee-box of the in­ter­est­ing 175-me­tre par-three sig­na­ture 17th hole over wa­ter. Sadly, Koh saw his tee-shot find wa­ter on the right of the green while Choo found the “dance floor”.</p>
    <p>So Koh’s chal­lenge fiz­zled out as he slumped to a dou­ble-bo­gey to trail Choo by three go­ing into the rel­a­tively easy par-four fin­ish­ing hole. Then when ev­ery­one thought that the ti­tle was Choo’s, Jesse Yap emerged as a strong com­peti­tor from the last flight.</p>
    <p>Choo too be­lieved that it could end up in a tie while sit­ting in the club­house. Then when Yap walked into the Nest din­ing area and con­grat­u­lated Choo, only then did the af­fa­ble Kep­pel Club mem­ber dis­cover that Yap had bo­geyed the 17th and fin­ished one shot be­hind for the $3,000 prize.</p>
    <p>Choo, ly­ing a four-way joint-third af­ter the first day with an even-par round, shot a two-un­der 70 yes­ter­day in wet con­di­tions to fin­ish on a 142 to­tal for the $4,000 prize as Ftag cham­pion, while Yap fin­ished on 143 af­ter yes­ter­day’s 71.</p>
    <p>Koh fin­ished third, tied with Mar­dan Ma­mat and Ab­dul Hadi in the nine-player pro­fes­sional sec­tion, spe­cially carved out from the am­a­teur event to give the lead­ing lo­cal pro­fes­sion­als com­pet­i­tive rounds in prepa­ra­tion for big events com­ing up.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness­men James Koh and Kelvin Chng, co-founders of Chrono95 watch com­pany, stepped for­ward to help the lo­cal pro­fes­sion­als who have been left stranded with no events since March be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The two “god­fa­thers” who had pledged their spon­sor­ship in March of Choo and Koh for ma­jor events in the re­gion by com­mit­ting to take care of their travel ex­penses and of­fer of a re­tainer, have now widen the benev­o­lence with the an­nounce­ment that sim­i­lar monthly events for lo­cal play­ing pro­fes­sion­als will be staged The next one is slated for Tanah Merah Coun­try Club’s Tampines course.</p>
    <p>Choo said: “Winning an event is al­ways great, but the big­ger bonus is the op­por­tu­nity for stiff play­ing ex­pe­ri­ence. All the pro­fes­sion­als are thank­ful to James and Chng for pro­vid­ing us such games to keep us in tune.</p>
    <p>“We can’t be just prac­tis­ing all the time, and as you know some of th­ese pro­fes­sion­als are also spend­ing some time teach­ing to break the se­quence. Such events go a long way to help us hone our games and our play­ing stan­dards are quite even.”</p>
    <p>“WINNING AN EVENT IS AL­WAYS GREAT, BUT THE BIG­GER BONUS IS THE OP­POR­TU­NITY FOR STIFF PLAY­ING EX­PE­RI­ENCE. ALL THE PRO­FES­SION­ALS ARE THANK­FUL TO JAMES AND CHNG FOR PRO­VID­ING US SUCH GAMES TO KEEP US IN TUNE.”</p>
