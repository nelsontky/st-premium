    <p>LON­DON Lionel Messi was de­nied a po­ten­tially money-spin­ning move away from Barcelona this month after a con­tract dis­pute but the Ar­gen­tinian mae­stro re­mains the world’s rich­est foot­ball player.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a list compiled by Forbes, the 33-year-old’s earn­ings this year to­talled US$126 mil­lion (S$171.4 mil­lion) – US$92 mil­lion from his salary and US$34 mil­lion in en­dorse­ments.</p>
    <p>Not sur­pris­ingly, his ri­val Cris­tiano Ron­aldo comes in sec­ond, al­though his in­come of US$117 mil­lion will soften the blow for the Ju­ven­tus for­ward, as will his sta­tus as the most fol­lowed foot­baller on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Ney­mar (US$96 mil­lion) is third, ahead of Paris Saint-Ger­main team­mate, 21-year-old Kylian Mbappe (US$42 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>The Pre­mier League re­mains the world’s rich­est foot­ball league but only three of its play­ers fea­ture in the top 10 – Liver­pool striker Mo­hamed Salah (US$37 mil­lion) is fifth,</p>
    <p>Manch­ester United’s mid­fielder Paul Pogba (US$34 mil­lion) sixth and team­mate, goal­keeper David de Gea (US$27 mil­lion), 10th.</p>
    <p>Barcelona’s An­toine Griez­mann (seventh, US$33 mil­lion), Real Madrid’s Gareth Bale (eighth, US$29 mil­lion) and Robert Le­wandowski of Bay­ern Mu­nich (ninth, US$28 mil­lion) round up the top 10.</p>
    <p>Messi re­luc­tantly agreed to stay at Barcelona for an­other sea­son de­spite say­ing he wanted out after the 8-2 Cham­pi­ons League de­feat by Bay­ern.</p>
    <p>He ar­gued that a clause in his con­tract stat­ing that a €700 mil­lion (S$1.1 bil­lion) re­lease fee would need to be met for him to join an­other club was no longer ac­tive and that he could leave on a free trans­fer, which would have al­lowed him to com­mand astro­nom­i­cal wages.</p>
    <p>He is in the fi­nal year of the deal so he could leave for free next sum­mer. By stay­ing, he is also in line for the US$83 mil­lion loy­alty bonus.</p>
