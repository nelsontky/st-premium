    <p>•</p>
    <p>A vac­cine jointly de­vel­oped by Pfizer and BioN­Tech was 90 per cent ef­fec­tive in pre­vent­ing Covid-19 in­fec­tions in on­go­ing phase 3 tri­als, the com­pa­nies an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Pro­tec­tion in pa­tients was achieved seven days af­ter the sec­ond of two doses, and 28 days af­ter the first, ac­cord­ing to pre­lim­i­nary find­ings.</p>
    <p>“The first set of re­sults from our phase 3 Covid-19 vac­cine trial pro­vides the ini­tial ev­i­dence of our vac­cine’s abil­ity to pre­vent Covid-19,” said Pfizer chair­man and chief ex­ec­u­tive Al­bert Bourla.</p>
    <p>“We are a sig­nif­i­cant step closer to pro­vid­ing peo­ple around the world with a much-needed break­through to help bring an end to this global health cri­sis.”</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the news, the Rus­sian Health Min­istry said its Sput­nik V vac­cine against Covid-19 is more than 90 per cent ef­fec­tive, cit­ing data col­lated from vac­ci­na­tions of the pub­lic rather than from an on­go­ing trial.</p>
    <p>“We are re­spon­si­ble for mon­i­tor­ing the ef­fec­tive­ness of the Sput­nik V vac­cine among cit­i­zens who have re­ceived it as part of the mass vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme,” said Pro­fes­sor Oksana Drap­kina, direc­tor of a re­search in­sti­tute un­der the Health Min­istry. “Based on our ob­ser­va­tions, it is also more than 90 per cent (ef­fec­tive).”</p>
    <p>World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion se­nior of­fi­cial Bruce Ayl­ward de­scribed the news on the Pfiz­erBioNTech tri­als as “very pos­i­tive”.</p>
    <p>A Covid-19 vac­cine may be rolled</p>
    <p>out by next March to the most vul­ner­a­ble, which could fun­da­men­tally change the course of the pan­demic, he said.</p>
    <p>Across the globe, Covid-19 in­fec­tion rates are hit­ting record highs.</p>
    <p>Pfizer and BioN­Tech ex­pect to sup­ply up to 50 mil­lion vac­cine doses glob­ally this year, and up to 1.3 bil­lion doses next year.</p>
    <p>Bloomberg re­ported that the com­pa­nies’ study, which in­volved tens of thou­sands of vol­un­teers, has been the most en­cour­ag­ing sci­en­tific ad­vance so far in the bat­tle against the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Pfizer shares rose by 8.4 per cent about an hour into trad­ing af­ter open­ing up 15 per cent from the pre­vi­ous close. BioN­Tech Amer­i­can de­posi­tary re­ceipts gained 10.5 per cent, com­pared with 24 per cent at the open.</p>
    <p>The trial find­ings are based on an in­terim analysis con­ducted af­ter 94 par­tic­i­pants con­tracted Covid-19. The tri­als will con­tinue un­til 164 cases have oc­curred.</p>
    <p>If the data holds up and a key safety read-out Pfizer ex­pects in about a week also looks good, it could mean the world has a vi­tal tool to con­trol the virus that has killed over 1.2 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Dr Wil­liam Gru­ber, Pfizer’s se­nior vice-pres­i­dent for vac­cine clin­i­cal re­search and de­vel­op­ment, said: “This is about the best the news could pos­si­bly be for the world and for the United States and for pub­lic health.”</p>
    <p>With ef­fec­tive­ness for the first vac­cines ex­pected to be in the range of 60 per cent to 70 per cent, “more than 90 per cent is ex­tra­or­di­nary”, said BioN­Tech chief ex­ec­u­tive Ugur Sahin. “It shows that Covid-19 can be con­trolled. At the end of the day, it’s re­ally a vic­tory of sci­ence.”</p>
    <p>The data does have lim­its. For now, few de­tails on the vac­cine’s ef­fi­cacy are avail­able. It is not known how well the shot works in key sub-groups, like the el­derly.</p>
    <p>Also, it is not known whether the vac­cine pre­vents se­vere dis­ease, as none of the par­tic­i­pants in this round of analysis were se­vere cases, Dr Gru­ber said.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den yes­ter­day hailed the news as a “cause for hope” but warned of a long bat­tle still ahead. “(It) is also im­por­tant to un­der­stand that the end of the bat­tle against Covid-19 is still months away,” he said, stress­ing the im­por­tance of mask-wear­ing.</p>
