    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The US labour mar­ket im­proved in Oc­to­ber by more than fore­cast, de­fy­ing ex­pec­ta­tions for more sub­dued gains amid an in­ten­si­fy­ing Covid-19 pan­demic and lack of ad­di­tional fis­cal re­lief.</p>
    <p>Non-farm pay­rolls in­creased by 638,000 af­ter an up­wardly re­vised 672,000 gain i n the pre­vi­ous month, ac­cord­ing to a Labour De­part­ment re­port yes­ter­day. That com­pared with the 580,000 me­dian es­ti­mate of econ­o­mists sur­veyed by Bloomberg, and re­flected a de­cline of 147,000 in tem­po­rary cen­sus work­ers.</p>
    <p>The un­em­ploy­ment rate in the United States fell to 6.9 per cent from 7.9 per cent, a big­ger de­cline than econ­o­mists pro­jected.</p>
    <p>Progress in the US labour mar­ket is hold­ing up as house­hold sav­ings help fuel spend­ing and busi­ness in­vest­ment re­bounds, pro­vid­ing who­ever wins the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion with an econ­omy that is in bet­ter shape than many an­a­lysts ex­pected just six months ago.</p>
    <p>But jobs re­main 10 mil­lion be­low pre-pan­demic lev­els, and with coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions ris­ing at a record rate this week, main­tain­ing the pace of hir­ing may be dif­fi­cult.</p>
    <p>Other fig­ures point to an in­creas­ingly frag­ile l abour mar­ket be­neath the head­line num­bers. The num­ber of per­ma­nent job losses was at 3.7 mil­lion last month, 2.4 mil­lion above its level be­fore the pan­demic, while the num­ber of peo­ple job­less for at least 27 weeks grew by 1.2 mil­lion, in­di­cat­ing some Amer­i­cans were hav­ing trou­ble find­ing em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>And the num­ber of peo­ple work­ing part time be­cause they can­not find a full-time job re­bounded last month af­ter fall­ing in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>The re­port un­der­scored the chal­lenges the next pres­i­dent, whether it is in­cum­bent Repub­li­can Don­ald Trump or Demo­crat Joe Bi­den, will con­front to keep the econ­omy grow­ing as it heals from the deep­est re­ces­sion since the Great De­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>A grid­lock in the US Congress may also re­duce the chances of an­other coro­n­avirus res­cue pack­age from the gov­ern­ment this year. Even if more fis­cal pol­icy is agreed on, it will likely be smaller than had been an­tic­i­pated be­fore the Nov 3 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>That will shift the spot­light to the Fed­eral Re­serve. The US cen­tral bank kept in­ter­est rates near zero on Thurs­day. Fed chair Jerome Pow­ell ac­knowl­edged the pace of im­prove­ment in the econ­omy and labour mar­ket had mod­er­ated, not­ing that the re­cov­ery would be stronger with more fis­cal sup­port.</p>
    <p>More than US$3 tril­lion (S$4 tril­lion) in gov­ern­ment pan­demic re­lief for busi­nesses and work­ers fu­elled a his­toric 33.1 per cent an­nu­alised rate of eco­nomic growth in the third quar­ter. That fol­lowed a record 31.4 per cent pace of con</p>
    <p>trac­tion in the April-June quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Lack of fis­cal stim­u­lus and spi­ralling new in­fec­tions across the coun­try have put the US econ­omy on a sharply slower growth path head­ing into the fourth quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Restau­rants and gyms have moved out­doors, but cooler weather and the resur­gence in Covid-19 in­fec­tions could leave many in trou­ble.</p>
    <p>Even if states and lo­cal gov­ern­ments do not im­pose new re­stric­tions on busi­nesses, con­sumers are likely to stay away, fear­ing ex­po­sure to the res­pi­ra­tory ill­ness. The US set a one-day record for new coro­n­avirus cases on Wed­nes­day with at least 102,591 in­fec­tions, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters tally.</p>
    <p>Though small and medium-sized busi­nesses have suf­fered most from the pan­demic, large cor­po­ra­tions have not been spared. Exxon Mo­bil last month an­nounced 1,900 layoffs in the US. Boe­ing said it ex­pected to elim­i­nate about 30,000 jobs, 11,000 more than pre­vi­ously planned, by end-2021.</p>
    <p>While the un­em­ploy­ment rate has dropped from a peak of 14.7 per</p>
    <p>cent in April, it has been dis­torted by peo­ple mis­clas­si­fy­ing them­selves as be­ing “em­ployed but ab­sent from work”.</p>
    <p>At least 21.5 mil­lion peo­ple were re­ceiv­ing un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits in mid-Oc­to­ber. Many peo­ple, mostly women, have dropped out</p>
    <p>of the labour force to look af­ter their chil­dren or be­cause they fear con­tract­ing the virus.</p>
