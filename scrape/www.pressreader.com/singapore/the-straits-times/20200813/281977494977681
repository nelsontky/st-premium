    <p>STONE­HAVEN (Scot­land) • A train de­railed in eastern Scot­land yes­ter­day, killing three peo­ple, in what Scot­tish premier Ni­cola Stur­geon de­scribed as an ex­tremely se­ri­ous in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Six oth­ers were taken to hospi­tal but their in­juries were not thought to be se­ri­ous, Bri­tish Trans­port Po­lice added in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“Very sadly, de­spite the best ef­forts of paramedics, we can con­firm that three peo­ple have been pro­nounced dead at the scene,” the state­ment said, adding that the driver of the train was be­lieved to have been among them.</p>
    <p>Dark smoke bil­lowed from a wood­land area at the bot­tom of a nar­row val­ley near Stone­haven, just south of the city of Aberdeen, af­ter the Sco­tRail train de­railed in the morn­ing fol­low­ing heavy rain overnight.</p>
    <p>Two air am­bu­lances and about 30 emer­gency ser­vice ve­hi­cles could be seen in a field just above the site of the de­rail­ment, which ap­peared to be dif­fi­cult to ac­cess.</p>
    <p>“My deep­est con­do­lences are with the loved ones of those who lost their lives in this tragic in­ci­dent,” said Ms Stur­geon.</p>
    <p>Po­lice re­ceived re­ports of a train de­rail­ing near Stone­haven at 9:40am lo­cal time.</p>
    <p>The BBC re­ported that the train – which was headed for Glas­gow – was made up of two lo­co­mo­tives, one at the front and one at the back, and four pas­sen­ger car­riages.</p>
    <p>It said the front lo­co­mo­tive and three of the car­riages had left the track and were sit­ting on a river em­bank­ment.</p>
    <p>Stone­haven and the sur­round­ing area had been hit by floods and some re­ports sug­gested a land­slide might have played a part in the de­rail­ment, al­though that was not con­firmed by the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain has one of Europe’s low­est rates of fa­tal rail ac­ci­dents, with a stronger safety record than Ger­many or France in re­cent years, ac­cord­ing to Euro­stat data.</p>
