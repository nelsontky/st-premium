    <p>An ap­pli­ca­tion hear­ing by the un­se­cured work­ing group (UWG) of bank­ing cred­i­tors to put trou­bled wa­ter treat­ment firm Hyflux un­der judicial man­age­ment was ad­journed in the High Court yes­ter­day for at least three more weeks.</p>
    <p>A new hear­ing date has not been set. Fur­ther di­rec­tions on time­lines will be given at a pre-trial con­fer­ence to be fixed in a few days.</p>
    <p>Hyflux’s debt mora­to­rium has been ex­tended un­til the new hear­ing date.</p>
    <p>In an un­usual twist, Jus­tice Aedit Ab­dul­lah asked Hyflux’s lawyers to file an af­fi­davit by to­day ex­plain­ing why they are seek­ing an ad­journ­ment of the judicial man­age­ment ap­pli­ca­tion hear­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Nish Shetty, a part­ner at Cave­nagh Law, the firm’s lawyers, told The Straits Times: “The court was un­happy that the re­quest for ad­journ­ment was made at a late stage, that is, (yes­ter­day) morn­ing.”</p>
    <p>The UWG of banks com­pris­ing Mizuho, KfW, Bangkok Bank, BNP Paribas, Stan­dard Char­tered Bank, CTBC Bank and the Korea Devel­op­ment Bank filed an ap­pli­ca­tion in Au­gust for a judicial man­age­ment or­der.</p>
    <p>This came af­ter the court gave the green light for the group to be carved out of Hyflux’s debt mora­to­rium as the UWG felt it could no longer trust the firm’s man­age­ment to lead any re­struc­tur­ing ef­fort.</p>
    <p>But yes­ter­day’s hear­ing on the judicial man­age­ment ap­pli­ca­tion was post­poned af­ter Mr Shetty cited on­go­ing ne­go­ti­a­tions with some pre­vi­ous suit­ors of Hyflux and a new for­mal ex­pres­sion of in­ter­est from Amer­i­can fund man­ager Strate­gic Growth In­vest­ments (SGI) on Mon­day to in­vest at least $204.78 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>“The court asked Cave­nagh Law to ex­plain the cir­cum­stances in which the de­ci­sion to seek an ad­journ­ment was made. I ex­plained that it has been a dy­namic 48 hours,” Mr Shetty said.</p>
    <p>“We have the SGI (ex­pres­sion of in­ter­est), Pi­son (In­vest­ments) clar­i­fy­ing ne­go­ti­a­tions they are hav­ing with UWG and Utico re­vis­ing its of­fer, so we need time for these fresh over­tures to be worked out.”</p>
    <p>The Busi­ness Times re­ported last month that Pi­son had re­ceived 158 ten­der ap­pli­ca­tion forms from note hold­ers and other el­i­gi­ble cred­i­tors, but ef­forts to en­gage with the UWG had fallen through.</p>
    <p>Pi­son, the in­vest­ment ve­hi­cle of In­done­sian ty­coon Johnny Wid­jaja, had in early July made a for­mal cash of­fer for the debts of Hyflux’s bank lenders, note hold­ers and other senior un­se­cured cred­i­tors via a “re­verse Dutch auc­tion”.</p>
    <p>The Busi­ness Times re­ported that Pi­son had said more than 150 other el­i­gi­ble cred­i­tors have sub­mit­ted ten­der ap­pli­ca­tions, and that it had to de­cide which to ac­cept by Sept 25.</p>
    <p>The com­pany said then that once it had com­pleted the pur­chase of a “sig­nif­i­cant por­tion” of the el­i­gi­ble debt, it would turn its at­ten­tion to the hold­ers of the per­pet­ual cap­i­tal se­cu­ri­ties and pref­er­ence shares.</p>
