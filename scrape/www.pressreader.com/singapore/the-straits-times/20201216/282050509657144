    <p>A 29-year-old Bangladesh­i worker at a Land Trans­port Author­ity (LTA) con­struc­tion site be­side the Changi MRT de­pot died yes­ter­day morn­ing af­ter a work­place ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>This comes af­ter a spate of five work­place fa­tal­i­ties in the two weeks be­tween late last month and early this month, which prompted the labour move­ment to urge com­pa­nies to pri­ori­tise and safe­guard the safety of work­ers.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that the lat­est ac­ci­dent hap­pened in Koh Sek Lim Road, which runs into the Changi MRT de­pot.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said they were alerted to the ac­ci­dent at 9.58am yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment last night, LTA said: “Dur­ing the ex­trac­tion of sheet piles, the weld­ing joint hold­ing two sheet piles to­gether broke, caus­ing part of the sheet pile to fall on a worker. The worker was pro­nounced dead at the scene.”</p>
    <p>Sheet piles, usu­ally made of steel, tim­ber or con­crete, are used in con­struc­tion to help re­tain soil and pro­vide ex­ca­va­tion sup­port. They can ei­ther be per­ma­nent or tem­po­rary struc­tures.</p>
    <p>“A safety time­out has been im­posed on T315 (work­site) for the con­trac­tor to re­view work pro­cesses re­lat­ing to sheet pile ex­trac­tion... LTA has also re­minded all project teams and con­trac­tors to ob­serve work­site safety,” said a spokesman, adding that LTA is as­sist­ing MOM and the po­lice in their in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>LTA is sad­dened by the ac­ci­dent and will work with Lum Chang Build­ing Con­trac­tors to help the vic­tim’s fam­ily, said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to MOM, the vic­tim was hired by BLT Ge­oworks.</p>
    <p>Lum Chang was awarded the $325 mil­lion con­tract for the project in 2016. The scope of the project in­cludes build­ing a new plat­form at Tanah Merah sta­tion and ex­tend­ing the East-West Line train tracks to con­nect the new East Coast In­te­grated De­pot in Changi.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Trades Union Congress as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Melvin</p>
    <p>Yong said in a Face­book post ear­lier this month that the num­ber of work­place fa­tal­i­ties this year was more than two-thirds of the to­tal last year, when 39 lives were lost.</p>
    <p>He ex­pressed con­cern and alarm over the sharp in­crease in ac­ci­dents re­cently, and said the fig­ures serve as a crit­i­cal re­minder of the need to guard against fa­tigue or even com­pla­cency as Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ues to move to­wards phase three of its re­open­ing.</p>
