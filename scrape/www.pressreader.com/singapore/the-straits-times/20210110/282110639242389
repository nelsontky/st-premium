    <p>Talk about a pro­duc­tive pan­demic. Driven by ne­ces­sity or sim­ply hav­ing more free time, th­ese people em­barked on am­bi­tious projects un­der the shadow of Covid-19. A world record was claimed, books were writ­ten and en­trepreneur­s emerged. Here are some ideas on how to make good use of a pan­demic</p>
    <p>Best friends Re­becca Kwan and Laven­der Chia had just reg­is­tered their new on­line busi­ness. The 24year-olds were flush with ex­cite­ment, brim­ming with plans for MoguShop, which would sell Ja­panese gro­ceries.</p>
    <p>Mere hours later, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong an­nounced plans for a cir­cuit breaker to stem the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>That fate­ful day in early April last year is one they will never for­get.</p>
    <p>Ms Chia re­calls: “There was no time to feel sorry (for our­selves). It was about how we were go­ing to build a new brand when people were seek­ing com­fort and se­cu­rity with more es­tab­lished brands.”</p>
    <p>The duo be­came firm friends while study­ing and munch­ing their way through Singapore Man­age­ment Univer­sity. They shared a love of Ja­panese food, but of­ten lamented the high prices and wanted to bring in more af­ford­able op­tions.</p>
    <p>Be­fore pool­ing their sav­ings and in­vest­ing a five­fig­ure sum with two oth­ers to start MoguShop, Ms Chia worked for 10 months as an ac­count ex­ec­u­tive in the food and bev­er­age in­dus­try. This is Ms Kwan’s first job af­ter grad­u­at­ing in De­cem­ber 2019.</p>
    <p>MoguShop sells a range of Ja­panese items such as rice, sauces, salt, meat, uni (sea urchin) and crisps with flavours like un­agi (eel) and plum bonito. They con­tacted some of their sup­pli­ers through Ja­panese pre­fec­ture trade as­so­ci­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pan­demic hit, they planned to ap­proach the mar­ket through pop-up stores. But Covid-19 paved the way for com­mu­nity group buys, where they sold their prod­ucts in bulk, li­ais­ing with the man­age­ment at con­do­mini­ums.</p>
    <p>They also hopped onto the Face­book live-stream band­wagon, which took off last year. Ms Chia would host the ses­sions show­cas­ing their prod­ucts, some­times chomp­ing on men­taiko-flavoured rice crack­ers to show their ap­peal.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 gift­ing” – gift pack­ages de­liv­ered to friends and fam­ily – was another big trend they ben­e­fited from.</p>
    <p>But there were chal­lenges too. Prices of some sup­plies rose by 30 per cent amid the un­cer­tainty of the pan­demic. Pack­ag­ing costs also rock­eted.</p>
    <p>Still, Ms Chia re­ports that MoguShop, which has two other em­ploy­ees, is “on the brink of break­ing even” in 10 months.</p>
    <p>It now stocks 700 items, up from 150 at the be­gin­ning. At the end of last year, it launched Snack­bar, a line of Ja­panese snacks and bev­er­ages.</p>
    <p>The pair say their friend­ship has been strength­ened through be­com­ing busi­ness part­ners in a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ms Chia says: “We com­ple­ment each other well. We’re both re­spon­si­ble and we al­ways want to do bet­ter.”</p>
