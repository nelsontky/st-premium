    <p>Not to be con­fused with King Kong, an in­stal­la­tion of a gi­ant mon­key perched on the side of a building will be un­veiled here next year, to spread aware­ness about wildlife con­ser­va­tion.</p>
    <p>The daz­zling pub­lic art in­stal­la­tion cre­ated by Aus­tralian artist Lisa Roet will be un­veiled on the former Man­ulife Cen­tre, now re­named 5One Cen­tral, i n Bras Basah Road in the sec­ond half of next year.</p>
    <p>In­spired by the en­dan­gered snub-nosed mon­key in­hab­it­ing the cool mountain forests of Yun­nan,</p>
    <p>China, the in­flat­able sculp­ture, which has been sim­i­larly ex­e­cuted in Bei­jing, Hong Kong and Mel­bourne, will be Roet’s first in South­east Asia.</p>
    <p>Mar­ry­ing con­ser­va­tion and art, the 53-year-old says de­for­esta­tion and the ex­tinc­tion of species are two is­sues she wants to bring to the fore through the work.</p>
    <p>Says Roet: “I want to raise aware­ness of the plight of forests and the ecosys­tem, but I want to make it beau­ti­ful so that peo­ple ap­pre­ci­ate it and so that they en­joy it, with­out de­pict­ing a bleak pic­ture.”</p>
    <p>She adds that she wanted to recre­ate the snub-nosed mon­key and pay tribute to the an­i­mal’s home.</p>
    <p>“These dense forests are a nat­u­ral won­der of the world and have such a di­verse ecosys­tem. I de­cided to recre­ate that newly dis­cov­ered species, but also present the art­work as a sym­bol of some of the is­sues plagu­ing these vast forests,” she says.</p>
    <p>Roet orig­i­nally wanted to be an an­thro­pol­o­gist or zo­ol­o­gist, but later fo­cused on art and has been ac­tive for about 30 years in the field of en­vi­ron­men­tal art, which refers to prac­tices in­clud­ing the use of nat­u­ral ma­te­ri­als or cre­at­ing art work that draws at­ten­tion to con­ser­va­tion.</p>
    <p>“As I vis­ited Bor­neo and other places, I saw the degra­da­tion of the forests be­fore my very eyes and it was quite shock­ing. Although it was not my in­ten­tion when I first started, these themes slowly crept into my work,” she says.</p>
    <p>She de­scribes the in­stal­la­tion, called the Golden Mon­key, as a way for cor­po­ra­tions and art to come to­gether in con­ser­va­tion.</p>
    <p>The artist was ap­proached by prop­erty fund man­agers Chels­field Asia and ARA As­set Man­age­ment, which had jointly ac­quired the building, to work on the project last year.</p>
    <p>Be­hind the work lies a metic­u­lous cre­ative process that aims to min­imise car­bon foot­print and en­sure sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>Roet per­forms a car­bon off­set anal­y­sis and stud­ies the car­bon foot­print ac­cu­mu­lated in the ex­e­cu­tion of the work, from its tex­tiles to trans­port. She takes into con­sid­er­a­tion how biodegrad­able and durable the ma­te­rial is, and if it can be taken down and re­dis­tributed for other tex­tile uses af­ter the in­stal­la­tion is re­moved.</p>
    <p>She worked with four stu­dents from Lasalle Col­lege of the Arts to de­sign hoard­ing around the building that draws in­spi­ra­tion from Yun­nan’s pine forests. The hoard­ing will re­main in place un­til the un­veil­ing of the Golden Mon­key.</p>
    <p>Former Lasalle stu­dent Eu­gene Lee, 30, who worked on the hoard­ing project with Roet, says team mem­bers worked to­gether to flesh out in a short pe­riod of time a de­sign in­spired by the mon­key’s habi­tat.</p>
    <p>She says her big­gest take­away from the ex­pe­ri­ence was un­der­stand­ing that artists have a cru­cial role now more than ever in ad­dress­ing im­por­tant is­sues.</p>
    <p>Says Ms Lee: “Artists can bridge the gap be­tween sci­en­tists and the lay­man by in­form­ing the pub­lic through their work. As an as­pir­ing artist, I want to em­u­late how Lisa man­aged to min­imise waste and lower her car­bon foot­print.”</p>
