    <p>The top court has asked lawyers rep­re­sent­ing the var­i­ous par­ties in the law­suit in­volv­ing Alju­nied-Hougang Town Coun­cil (AHTC) and Pasir Ris-Pung­gol Town Coun­cil (PRPTC) against Work­ers’ Party (WP) chair­man Sylvia Lim and oth­ers to ad­dress is­sues it has raised for the hear­ing of the case.</p>
    <p>The Court of Ap­peal posed the ques­tions in a let­ter last week af­ter hav­ing read and con­sid­ered their pa­pers and sub­mis­sions, ac­cord­ing to court records.</p>
    <p>Among other things, the court has asked the par­ties to ad­dress the is­sue of whether Par­lia­ment in­tended for town coun­cil­lors or em­ploy­ees of town coun­cils to owe fidu­ciary du­ties when per­form­ing their statu­tory func­tions.</p>
    <p>Fidu­ciary du­ties in­volve pri­vate law, which is a branch of law that deals with the re­la­tions be­tween in­di­vid­u­als or in­sti­tu­tions, un­like pub­lic law, which deals with the re­la­tions be­tween such en­ti­ties and the state.</p>
    <p>The Court of Ap­peal wants par­ties to ad­dress the im­pli­ca­tions of the High Court’s find­ing, that the first to sev­enth de­fen­dants owed fidu­ciary du­ties, on the nor­mal dis­tinc­tion be­tween pri­vate law and pub­lic law.</p>
    <p>The court also wants par­ties to ad­dress the scope of Sec­tion 52 of the Town Coun­cils Act and whether any of the de­fen­dants are en­ti­tled to claim im­mu­nity un­der the sec­tion and, if so, in re­la­tion to which claims.</p>
    <p>The ap­peals court hear­ing that is due later this year fol­lows a High Court judg­ment last year, which held that for­mer WP chief Low Thia Khi­ang and Ms Lim had breached their fidu­ciary du­ties to AHTC, among other things.</p>
    <p>They were then town coun­cil­lors of AHTC, which, through an in­de­pen­dent panel, had taken a civil suit against them for al­leged im­proper pay­ments made un­der their watch.</p>
    <p>The case also in­volved cur­rent WP chief Pri­tam Singh and two other AHTC town coun­cil­lors, along with its for­mer man­ag­ing agent com­pany FM So­lu­tions and</p>
    <p>Ser­vices and the com­pany’s two own­ers.</p>
    <p>The eight de­fen­dants are ap­peal­ing in re­la­tion to the main suit by AHTC.</p>
    <p>Con­cur­rently, PRPTC, un­der which Pung­gol East was a WP ward at the time, is also ap­peal­ing against Jus­tice Kan­nan Ramesh’s judg­ment in re­la­tion to Ms Lim and three other de­fen­dants.</p>
    <p>PRPTC had run a par­al­lel suit against Ms Lim, Mr Low and six other de­fen­dants in the High Court for al­leged losses in­curred when Pung­gol East was un­der their watch. It ini­ti­ated the civil suit af­ter the WP-run AHTC had taken the same de­fen­dants to court.</p>
    <p>The Court of Ap­peal in its let­ter posed six sets of ques­tions, each themed on a par­tic­u­lar is­sue it listed.</p>
    <p>One set re­lates to the High</p>
    <p>Court’s find­ing that the first to sev­enth de­fen­dants owed fidu­ciary du­ties to the town coun­cil.</p>
    <p>“Is there any ev­i­dence that Par­lia­ment in­tended for town coun­cil­lors and em­ploy­ees of town coun­cils to owe fidu­ciary du­ties in the ex­e­cu­tion of their statu­tory func­tions?” asked the court.</p>
    <p>“Tak­ing into ac­count the ex­ist­ing regimes that reg­u­late town coun­cils and town coun­cil­lors, what role does fidu­ciary law play in this spe­cific con­text?” it added.</p>
    <p>Separately, the court also asked what the al­ter­na­tive re­liefs are if the first to sev­enth de­fen­dants are found not to owe fidu­ciary du­ties to the town coun­cil.</p>
    <p>In re­la­tion to claims for breach of the com­mon law duty of care, the court has asked to be ad­dressed on what are the rules by which dam­ages caused by each al­leged breach are to be as­sessed.</p>
    <p>Le­gal sources say the ques­tions sug­gest the court in­tends to clar­ify the in­ter­ac­tion be­tween pri­vate law (specif­i­cally, on fidu­ciary du­ties and com­mon law du­ties of care) and pub­lic law in the con­text of town coun­cils.</p>
    <p>“It is clear that the Court of Ap­peal wishes to hear ar­gu­ments on var­i­ous le­gal ques­tions about the pre­cise le­gal prin­ci­ples gov­ern­ing the du­ties that are owed by var­i­ous per­sons to town coun­cils,” said Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Uni­ver­sity’s (SMU) As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor of Law Ben­jamin Ong.</p>
    <p>“One im­por­tant is­sue is whether the de­fen­dants owe fidu­ciary du­ties to the plain­tiffs. There are cer­tain es­tab­lished cat­e­gories of case: for ex­am­ple, the di­rec­tor of a com­pany owes fidu­ciary du­ties to the com­pany; a lawyer owes fidu­ciary du­ties to a client.</p>
    <p>“But the courts have never be­fore had to ad­dress the ques­tion of who owes fidu­ciary du­ties to a town coun­cil,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Both fidu­ciary du­ties and du­ties of care are gov­erned by judge-made com­mon law. The twist in this case is that we have an­other source of law, namely, the fol­low­ing statutes: the Town Coun­cils Act and Town Coun­cils Fi­nan­cial Rules,” he added.</p>
    <p>SMU law lec­turer Nicholas Liu stressed that the ques­tions posed by the court do not sug­gest the court has formed any firm view on the dis­pute or any par­tic­u­lar out­come.</p>
    <p>“The plain­tiffs es­sen­tially ar­gue that both le­gal regimes im­pose du­ties and li­a­bil­ity on town coun­cil­lors. The de­fen­dants ar­gue that the two le­gal regimes are sep­a­rate: only pub­lic law ap­plies to town coun­cil­lors in the dis­charge of their du­ties to the town coun­cil. The plain­tiffs suc­ceeded at trial on this point.”</p>
