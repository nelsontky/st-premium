    <p>CDL Hos­pi­tal­ity Trusts (CDLHT) ex­pects its first-half per­for­mance will be se­verely af­fected amid the down­turn in global tourism and travel as a re­sult of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Its man­agers said last Fri­day that dis­tri­bu­tion per sta­pled se­cu­rity af­ter re­ten­tion is ex­pected to de­cline by 60 to 70 per cent in the six months to June 30 from the 4.16 cents paid out a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Dis­tributable in­come is ex­pected to fall by the same pro­por­tion, from $50.4 mil­lion last year.</p>
    <p>Pre­lim­i­nary es­ti­mates sug­gest the trust’s to­tal re­turn af­ter tax for the first half will record a mar­ginal loss, ver­sus the $30.6 mil­lion profit recorded last year.</p>
    <p>It will book one-off wind­ing­down costs from the di­vest­ment of Novo­tel Sin­ga­pore Clarke Quay, which closed on July 15. Ex­clud­ing the one-off ex­penses, the to­tal re­turn may reg­is­ter a slight profit in the first half, the man­agers said.</p>
    <p>They will con­tinue to value the as­sets at the end of the fi­nan­cial year, and any fair-value gains or losses will be noted in the full-year re­sults.</p>
    <p>How­ever, they said there is un­cer­tainty about the car­ry­ing amounts of the in­vest­ment prop­er­ties and fixed as­sets as of June 30, as th­ese were based on in­de­pen­dent val­u­a­tions as of Dec 31 last year, and have not taken into ac­count the pan­demic’s im­pact, which “may be sig­nif­i­cant”.</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional travel curbs largely re­main in place, even though the trust’s mar­kets have seen strict Covid-19 mea­sures pro­gres­sively re­laxed since the mid­dle of this year.</p>
    <p>Its over­seas prop­er­ties are closed tem­po­rar­ily or op­er­at­ing at low oc­cu­pan­cies, ex­cept its New Zealand ho­tel, Grand Mil­len­nium Auck­land.</p>
    <p>None­the­less, oc­cu­pan­cies at the Sin­ga­pore and New Zealand ho­tels con­tinue to be sup­ported by the de­mand for iso­la­tion ac­com­mo­da­tion.</p>
    <p>Over­all, rev­enue per avail­able room across the port­fo­lio has been and will con­tinue to be sig­nif­i­cantly af­fected, the man­agers said.</p>
    <p>“While sen­ti­ments point to a start of the re­cov­ery of travel in 2021... there is much un­cer­tainty on the re­cov­ery tra­jec­tory. A vi­able med­i­cal so­lu­tion is vi­tal to the pace of the pick-up in in­ter­na­tional travel.”</p>
    <p>The man­agers noted that the trust has suf­fi­cient liq­uid­ity and there are no con­cerns over its abil­ity to ful­fil its near-term debt obli­ga­tions and op­er­a­tional needs.</p>
    <p>The sta­pled group also reg­is­tered net cash in­flow of $26.8 mil­lion from two com­pleted deals this month – di­vest­ing Novo­tel Sin­ga­pore Clarke Quay and ac­quir­ing W Sin­ga­pore in Sen­tosa Cove.</p>
    <p>The first-half re­sults will be re­leased be­fore trad­ing on July 29.</p>
    <p>CDLHT closed down 2.94 per cent to 99 cents yes­ter­day.</p>
