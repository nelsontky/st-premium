    <p>TOKYO For­mer J-pop idol Masahiko Kondo (left) has been sus­pended by his agency in­def­i­nitely for hav­ing an ex­tra­mar­i­tal af­fair.</p>
    <p>Last week, the 56-year-old vet­eran singer was ac­cused by the Shukan Bun­shun weekly mag­a­zine of hav­ing an af­fair with a 31-year-old woman who runs a com­pany mak­ing tai­lored suits. The mag­a­zine said the af­fair has been go­ing on for five years.</p>
    <p>Kondo and the woman were pho­tographed by the mag­a­zine go­ing to Ok­i­nawa to play golf late last month. Also on the trip were the pres­i­dent of a listed com­pany and other busi­ness­men.</p>
    <p>Kondo and the woman re­turned to the ho­tel to­gether af­ter golf­ing, said the mag­a­zine.</p>
    <p>Kondo, who is nick­named Matchy, has been mar­ried since 1994 to Ms At­suko Wada, who is not from the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try. The cou­ple have a 13-year-old son.</p>
    <p>The singer did not re­act to the report when it came out last week. But he broke his si­lence early yes­ter­day when he is­sued an apol­ogy through his agency, Johnny & As­so­ciates.</p>
    <p>He ad­mit­ted that he has be­trayed his fam­ily and fans. He said he has ap­plied to the agency to sus­pend all his en­ter­tain­ment activities, so that he can make time for self-re­flec­tion and re­gain every­one’s trust.</p>
    <p>Pop­u­lar in the 1980s, Kondo had pre­vi­ously dated stars in­clud­ing the late Hong Kong singer Anita Mui.</p>
    <p>He was said to be in a love tri­an­gle with pop­u­lar singers Ak­ina Nakamori and Seiko Mat­suda in the 1980s, with Nakamori’s at­tempted sui­cide at his apart­ment in 1989 shock­ing fans through­out Asia.</p>
