    <p>Sin­ga­pore shares re­treated yes­ter­day, snap­ping a three-day rally as the ini­tial eu­pho­ria led by elec­tion and vac­cine news sub­sided.</p>
    <p>Sen­ti­ment across Asia was mixed, with key bench­marks for Hong Kong, Seoul and Jakarta end­ing the day lower, while Tokyo and Kuala Lumpur were in pos­i­tive ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>Axi’s chief global mar­kets strate­gist Stephen Innes said: “Asia’s fo­cus was on the stalling stock rally, mon­i­tor­ing global Covid-19 num­bers and China’s tech bounce fol­low­ing the wipe­out in past days due to tougher reg­u­la­tion.”</p>
    <p>He added that “price ac­tion has started to show signs of a lit­tle vac­cine ex­u­ber­ance ex­haus­tion”.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Straits Times In­dex (STI) slipped 0.05 per cent, or 1.38 points, to 2,711.90. Across the broader mar­ket, ad­vancers lagged de­clin­ers 201 to 274 af­ter 2.54 bil­lion se­cu­ri­ties worth $1.64 bil­lion changed hands.</p>
    <p>The big­gest gainer within the STI was Kep­pel DC Reit, which edged up 3.3 per cent to $2.79.</p>
    <p>At the bot­tom of the ta­ble was Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries, falling 2.4 per cent to $1.66. This was fol­lowed by DBS, which shed 1.8 per cent to $23.97.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, avi­a­tion and tourism-re­lated stocks on the blue-chip in­dex con­tin­ued to build on gains, though at a slower pace. Sin­ga­pore Air­lines, Sats and Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore ended the day higher.</p>
    <p>Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore was also the most ac­tive counter on the STI, gain­ing 0.7 per cent to 74.5 cents af­ter around 42.6 mil­lion shares changed hands.</p>
    <p>Out­side the STI, Jiu­tian Chem­i­cal, which pro­duces coal-based fine chem­i­cals, was the most heav­ily traded by vol­ume. The stock sank 26.1 per cent to 8.5 cents, with over 728.7 mil­lion shares traded. This was de­spite the Catal­ist-listed firm post­ing a record set of re­sults on Wed­nes­day.</p>
