    <p>•</p>
    <p>Nearly 21 months af­ter it was grounded fol­low­ing two deadly crashes, the Boe­ing 737 Max was sched­uled to re­turn to the skies yes­ter­day with a flight by Brazil­ian car­rier Gol.</p>
    <p>It is the first air­line to re­sume com­mer­cial flights with the nowover­hauled jet, say­ing it was fully con­fi­dent in the safety up­grades and ex­panded pi­lot train­ing pro­gramme im­ple­mented by Boe­ing as part of avi­a­tion reg­u­la­tors’ con­di­tions to re­cer­tify the plane.</p>
    <p>“For the past 20 months, we have been car­ry­ing out the most in­ten­sive safety re­view in the his­tory of com­mer­cial avi­a­tion,” said Gol’s vice-pres­i­dent for op­er­a­tions Celso Fer­rer. “Safety comes first and fore­most.”</p>
    <p>The 737 Max will make its re­turn on a morn­ing do­mes­tic flight.</p>
    <p>A Gol spokesman said: “In the event that a Gol client does not want to travel on the Boe­ing 737 Max, he will be able to resched­ule the trip with­out fees or fare dif­fer­ence, main­tain­ing the same ori­gin and des­ti­na­tion, within the va­lid­ity pe­riod for the ticket, which is 12 months from the date of pur­chase.</p>
    <p>“Ex­cep­tional sit­u­a­tions will be eval­u­ated on a case-by-case ba­sis.”</p>
    <p>Gol, the big­gest do­mes­tic air­line in Brazil, said 140 of its pi­lots had un­der­gone train­ing on the jet in the United States. The firm ex­pected to have its full fleet of seven 737 Max planes back in the air by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>In fact, Gol is so con­fi­dent in the plane that it plans to mas­sively ex­pand that fleet. Gol has con­firmed 95 firm or­ders for the 737 Max with Boe­ing, in ad­di­tion to 20 more al­ready in the US await­ing de­liv­ery, the spokesman said.</p>
    <p>The Max was grounded in March last year af­ter two crashes that to­gether killed 346 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The fall­out of the 2018 Lion Air and 2019 Ethiopian Air­lines crashes plunged Boe­ing into cri­sis – made worse for the US aerospace gi­ant by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions iden­ti­fied a prin­ci­pal cause of both crashes as a faulty flight han­dling sys­tem known as the ma­noeu­vring char­ac­ter­is­tics aug­men­ta­tion sys­tem, or MCAS. Meant to keep the plane from stalling as it as­cends, the au­to­mated sys­tem in­stead forced the nose of the plane down­ward.</p>
    <p>The US Fed­eral Avi­a­tion Ad­min­is­tra­tion or­dered Boe­ing to re­vamp the jet and im­ple­ment new pi­lot train­ing pro­to­cols. On Nov 18, it ap­proved the plane to re­turn to ser­vice af­ter the up­grades were put in place.</p>
    <p>Brazil’s Na­tional Civil Avi­a­tion Agency fol­lowed suit a week later.</p>
    <p>They are the only two avi­a­tion reg­u­la­tors to give the green light for the plane so far.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Union Avi­a­tion Safety Agency be­gan the process of re­cer­ti­fy­ing it last month.</p>
    <p>In the US, Amer­i­can Air­lines is ex­pected to be the first air­line to re­sume com­mer­cial ser­vice with the Max, with a flight sched­uled for Dec 29.</p>
