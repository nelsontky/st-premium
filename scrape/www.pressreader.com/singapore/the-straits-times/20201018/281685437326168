    <p>For Mr Nur Fa­zli, 33, who was laid off in June, tak­ing a six-month pay cut would have been bet­ter than los­ing his job.</p>
    <p>The former store su­per­vi­sor said he was taken by sur­prise when his em­ployer de­liv­ered the news, as he had be­lieved his lo­gis­tics job was se­cure.</p>
    <p>“I would rather have peo­ple cut my pay for a few months... than just (have) zero in­come,” he told The Sun­day Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one has to eat. We can­not just let peo­ple go like that.”</p>
    <p>His sen­ti­ments were echoed by other job seek­ers at a ca­reer fair held at Our Tampines Hub yes­ter­day, with some say­ing they were pre­pared to take up to a 50 per cent pay cut to se­cure a job.</p>
    <p>But most added that they would ac­tively look for other jobs, if wages stayed low for too long.</p>
    <p>On Fri­day, the Na­tional Wages Coun­cil (NWC) gave em­ploy­ers the green light to cut wages in or­der to save jobs, pro­vided that govern­ment sup­port and other cost-sav­ing mea­sures have been ex­hausted.</p>
    <p>It rec­om­mended that man­age­ment take ear­lier and deeper cuts, and also in­form their staff how their wages would even­tu­ally be re­stored.</p>
    <p>“The em­ployer must hon­our the fact that the pay cut is tem­po­rary,” said Ms Denise Tan, who at­tended yes­ter­day’s ca­reer fair. The former cus­tomer ser­vice ex­ec­u­tive, who is in her 50s, said she was will­ing to take a 30 per cent pay cut from her pre­vi­ous job. But she was doubt­ful that em­ploy­ers would re­in­state salaries once busi­ness im­proves.</p>
    <p>Around 1,400 jobs were on of­fer at the two-day fair which ended yes­ter­day. It was or­gan­ised by the North East Com­mu­nity De­vel­op­ment Coun­cil (CDC), in col­lab­o­ra­tion with NTUC’s Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute. The jobs in­clude po­si­tions in the re­tail, lo­gis­tics, trans­port and food and bev­er­age in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>North East CDC said the num­ber of res­i­dents seek­ing em­ploy­ment as­sis­tance has more than dou­bled over the past three months, com­pared with the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>ST also spoke to sev­eral Sin­ga­pore­ans who did not at­tend the job fair for their views on the NWC rec­om­men­da­tions this year.</p>
    <p>Some sug­gested that em­ploy­ers could stop pay­ing their por­tion of Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund con­tri­bu­tions as a cost-sav­ing mea­sure rather than cut­ting work­ers’ wages, while oth­ers raised con­cerns over hav­ing their pay cut even though their com­pany was still prof­itable.</p>
    <p>One of them was Ms P.T. Lee, 49, who works in the pri­vate ed­u­ca­tion in­dus­try. Her com­pany has al­ready im­ple­mented a wage freeze, which will likely be in place un­til Au­gust 2022, she said. With the NWC’s goa­head for pay cuts to save jobs, she is wor­ried that her em­ployer will fol­low suit. “I don’t think it is fair if the com­pany is mak­ing a profit and still cuts staff pay,” said Ms Lee.</p>
    <p>An­other Sin­ga­porean, who wanted to be known only as Muham­mad, said he would be able to stom­ach a 10 per cent pay cut. The 36-year-old, who works in the lo­gis­tics in­dus­try and earns be­tween $2,000 and $2,500 a month, said any­thing else would be a “bur­den”.</p>
    <p>Mr Muham­mad said his pay re­mains un­changed for now, al­though he has friends who have been af­fected. “For lower-wage em­ploy­ees, get­ting a salary freeze is ter­ri­ble,” he added. “Sav­ing for rainy days is not pos­si­ble for them, con­sid­er­ing the low wage and high liv­ing stan­dard in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
