    <p>LONDON • Tot­ten­ham Hot­spur’s fix­ture con­ges­tion has eased a lit­tle af­ter the English Premier League out­fit re­ceived a bye to move into the fourth round of the League Cup yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Their third-round tie at Ley­ton Ori­ent was called off on Tues­day af­ter sev­eral play­ers from the fourthtier side tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus, with the English Foot­ball League (EFL) con­firm­ing it meant a for­feit and not a reschedul­ing.</p>
    <p>A state­ment read: “Tot­ten­ham... will now play Chelsea on Tues­day Sept 29.</p>
    <p>“The board has de­ter­mined (Ori­ent) was un­able to ful­fil its obli­ga­tions to com­plete the fix­ture.”</p>
    <p>Due to their Europa League qual­i­fi­ca­tion com­mit­ments, Spurs were fac­ing the un­en­vi­able prospect of nine games in 22 days since their top-flight opener with Ever­ton on Sept 13.</p>
    <p>It is now one game fewer for Jose Mour­inho’s men, who on Thurs­day booked their berth in the play-offs af­ter beat­ing North Mace­do­nia’s Shk­endija 3-1.</p>
    <p>Goals from Erik Lamela, Son He­ung-min and sub­sti­tute Harry Kane fired Spurs to a 3-1 away vic­tory and should they de­feat Is­rael’s Mac­cabi Haifa at home next week, they will ad­vance to the group stage of the Europa League.</p>
    <p>The vis­i­tors were, ul­ti­mately, too good for the hosts, but there was a pre-match in­ci­dent re­sult­ing in Mour­inho tak­ing um­brage with the lower than usual goal posts em­ployed by their op­po­nents.</p>
    <p>Spurs goal­keep­ers Hugo Lloris and Joe Hart, who are 1.88m and 1.96m re­spec­tively, had no­ticed the di­men­sions were wrong and told the Por­tuguese, who took the mat­ter up with Uefa’s del­e­gate at the match in Skopje.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the game, the 1.74m Mour­inho posted a pic­ture of him­self on In­sta­gram nearly touch­ing the cross­bar.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore the game, (it) was a funny sit­u­a­tion be­cause my goal­keep­ers told me that the goal was small,” the Por­tuguese said.</p>
    <p>“I went by my­self and of course, the goal was small.</p>
    <p>“The goal­keep­ers, they spend hours and hours and hours in the goal so they know when the goal is not the right di­men­sion.</p>
    <p>“I am not a goal­keeper, but I know foot­ball since I was a kid and I know when I stand there and spread my arms and I know the dis­tance, so I felt im­me­di­ately that some­thing was go­ing wrong.</p>
    <p>“We got the Uefa del­e­gate to con­firm and yes it was 5cm smaller, and of course, we de­manded for the goals to be re­placed with goals of the right di­men­sion.”</p>
