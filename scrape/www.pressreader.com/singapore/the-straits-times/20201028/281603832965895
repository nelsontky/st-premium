    <p>Trav­ellers from more coun­tries will be al­lowed to serve their stay­home no­tice (SHN) at their own place of res­i­dence when they ar­rive here from Nov 4.</p>
    <p>Th­ese coun­tries are Es­to­nia, Fiji, Fin­land, Ja­pan, Nor­way, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thai­land and Turkey, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers from th­ese coun­tries can ap­ply to opt out of ded­i­cated SHN fa­cil­i­ties from Nov 2.</p>
    <p>This is con­di­tional on them ful­fill­ing cer­tain cri­te­ria, such as hav­ing not trav­elled to other coun­tries aside from the ones men­tioned in the last 14 days prior to en­try.</p>
    <p>They must also be stay­ing in their place of res­i­dence alone, or only with house­hold mem­bers who are also serv­ing the SHN and have the same travel his­tory and du­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, as the list of coun­tries will be con­sis­tently up­dated ac­cord­ing to pub­lic health risk as­sess­ment, “all trav­ellers must be pre­pared to be sub­ject to the pre­vail­ing bor­der mea­sures upon en­try, in­clud­ing stay in ded­i­cated stay­home no­tice fa­cil­i­ties and pay­ment, where ap­pli­ca­ble”, said the MOH.</p>
    <p>Other trav­ellers from se­lected low-risk coun­tries or re­gions must serve a seven-day SHN at their place of res­i­dence. All other trav­ellers must serve a 14-day SHN at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>All trav­ellers who choose to stay in their place of res­i­dence must re­main at their de­clared place at all times, and will be re­quired to wear an elec­tronic mon­i­tor­ing de­vice.</p>
    <p>They will be re­quired to ac­ti­vate it once they reach their place of res­i­dence.</p>
    <p>Phys­i­cal spot checks will be con­ducted as well, and strict en­force­ment ac­tion will be taken against those who breach their SHN or make false dec­la­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>Spe­cial trans­port ar­range­ments will have to be made from the im­mi­gra­tion check­point to the trav­eller’s place of res­i­dence and their re­spec­tive test­ing fa­cil­i­ties, where they have to be swabbed for Covid-19 be­fore the end of their stay-home no­tice. The to­tal cost of around $200 to $220 for all trips would be borne by the trav­eller.</p>
    <p>With ef­fect from Jan 1 next year, the Gov­ern­ment will no l onger waive the costs of stay at ded­i­cated SHN fa­cil­i­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents who last left Sin­ga­pore be­fore March 27 this year, as the vast ma­jor­ity have al­ready re­turned.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, all new and re­turn­ing trav­ellers, in­clud­ing long-term pass hold­ers, will be re­spon­si­ble for their med­i­cal bills, should they de­velop Covid-19 symp­toms within 14 days of their ar­rival.</p>
    <p>All short-term visit pass hold­ers who test pos­i­tive for Covid-19 will have to pay un­sub­sidised rates for med­i­cal treat­ment.</p>
