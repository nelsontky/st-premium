    <p>Not all of last week’s ma­jor tech an­nounce­ments oc­curred at the IFA trade show in Berlin.</p>
    <p>Graph­ics chip­maker Nvidia started the ball rolling on Sept 1, with the vir­tual launch of its new Ge­Force RTX 30 se­ries of desk­top graph­ics cards.</p>
    <p>Con­sist­ing of the flag­ship Ge­Force RTX 3090, as well as the RTX 3080 and RTX 3070, th­ese graph­ics cards are said to de­liver twice the per­for­mance and 1.9 times the power ef­fi­ciency of their pre­de­ces­sors.</p>
    <p>They also of­fer fu­ture-proof fea­tures, such as sup­port for HDMI 2.1, which en­ables a sin­gle ca­ble con­nec­tion to 8K tele­vi­sions for gam­ing, as well as sup­port for the new AV1 video codec, which uses sig­nif­i­cantly less band­width while stream­ing high-res­o­lu­tion videos.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Nvidia, the RTX 3090 ($2,365, avail­able from Sept 24) is the first graph­ics card to have 24GB of video mem­ory. It can run games at 8K res­o­lu­tion at a smooth 60 frames per sec­ond (fps).</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the RTX 3080 ($1,100, avail­able from Sept 17) is de­signed for 4K gam­ing and prom­ises over 60fps at 4K res­o­lu­tion, while the RTX 3070 ($790, avail­able from next month) is said to be 60 per cent faster than its RTX 2070 pre­de­ces­sor.</p>
    <p>Mr Mar­cus Wee, co-founder of lo­cal cus­tom PC builder After­shock, de­scribes the RTX 30 se­ries as the “cra­zi­est” launch he has seen in his eight years in the busi­ness – be­cause of the huge leap in per­for­mance over the pre­vi­ous gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>He pre­dicts that the new graph­ics cards will cause a huge shift in the in­dus­try. “Quad HD (2,560 x 1,440 pixels) will be­come the en­try-level res­o­lu­tion for gam­ing, while 4K will be the pop­u­lar mid-range op­tion.”</p>
    <p>Also shak­ing up the PC scene is</p>
    <p>In­tel. The chip gi­ant last Wed­nes­day of­fi­cially un­veiled its 11th-gen­er­a­tion Tiger Lake Core mo­bile pro­ces­sors, which of­fer higher clock speeds and up to twice the in­te­grated graph­ics per­for­mance of the Ice Lake pre­de­ces­sors.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to In­tel, a Tiger Lake notebook will have longer bat­tery life of about an hour or more than a sim­i­lar Ice Lake lap­top, de­pend­ing on the work­load.</p>
    <p>Mr Bryan Ma, vice-pres­i­dent of de­vices re­search at market re­search firm IDC, says Tiger Lake is a strong of­fer­ing that pro­vides a “rea­son­able gam­ing ex­pe­ri­ence in a thin and light de­vice”.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing its press brief­ing, In­tel showed the new In­tel Iris Xe in­te­grated graph­ics in the higher-end Core i7 Tiger Lake chips out­per­form­ing its com­peti­tors (AMD Radeon Graph­ics and Nvidia Ge­Force MX350) in games.</p>
    <p>Mr Ma adds that the new pro­ces­sors also tap ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence in ways that “fit in nicely with the work-from-home trend, par­tic­u­larly with use cases like back­ground noise re­duc­tion” in video con­fer­enc­ing.</p>
    <p>“Tiger Lake can at least help get In­tel back on its feet in the short term,” he says, not­ing that the com­pany has taken a few punches re­cently, from man­u­fac­tur­ing set</p>
    <p>backs to market share gains by ri­val AMD.</p>
    <p>The new Tiger Lake pro­ces­sors will power the new In­tel Evo branded note­books, the sec­ond it­er­a­tion of In­tel’s Pro­ject Athena in­no­va­tion pro­gram that aims to build the most ad­vanced lap­tops.</p>
    <p>Tar­geted at the premium seg­ment, In­tel Evo mod­els are guar­an­teed to meet cer­tain re­quire­ments, such as over nine hours of bat­tery life, wak­ing up from sleep in a sec­ond or less and sup­port for the WiFi 6 and Thun­der­bolt 4 stan­dards. More than 20 In­tel Evo lap­tops are ex­pected to be launched from ma­jor PC brands later this year.</p>
