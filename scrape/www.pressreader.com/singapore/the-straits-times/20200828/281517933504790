    <p>A new task force to cham­pion the pro­tec­tion of pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers and ex­ec­u­tives (PMEs) is be­ing set up by the labour move­ment.</p>
    <p>The task force will be headed by Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Pa­trick Tay and Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion (SNEF) ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor Sim Gim Guan, and will likely start work in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>The group aims to en­gage PMEs and em­ploy­ers over a six- to 12-month pe­riod and come up with rec­om­men­da­tions on gov­ern­ment pol­icy, best prac­tices for com­pa­nies and train­ing.</p>
    <p>NTUC sec­re­tary-gen­eral Ng Chee Meng said Sin­ga­pore has per­haps reached a tip­ping point where some de­gree of “mar­ket fail­ure” has oc­curred, caus­ing mid­dle-aged lo­cal PMEs to be­come more vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>He and SNEF pres­i­dent Robert Yap will be the task force’s ad­vis­ers.</p>
    <p>This ef­fort comes amid a pan­demic-trig­gered economic re­ces­sion which has seen jobs be­ing put at risk, and re­trench­ments are ex­pected to rise in Sin­ga­pore in the months ahead.</p>
    <p>Data from the Min­istry of Man­power shows that pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians typ­i­cally have a lower-thanaver­age rate of re-en­try into em­ploy­ment within six months of be­ing re­trenched.</p>
    <p>A new task force to cham­pion the pro­tec­tion of pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers and ex­ec­u­tives (PMEs) is be­ing set up by the labour move­ment, it an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The group will be headed by Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Pa­trick Tay and Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion (SNEF) ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor Sim Gim Guan, and will likely start work in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Its aims are to en­gage PMEs and em­ploy­ers over a six- to 12-month pe­riod and come up with rec­om­men­da­tions on gov­ern­ment pol­icy, best prac­tices for com­pa­nies and train­ing, said NTUC sec­re­tary-gen­eral Ng Chee Meng on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>He and SNEF pres­i­dent Robert Yap will be the task force’s ad­vis­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng said Sin­ga­pore has per­haps reached a tip­ping point where some de­gree of “mar­ket fail­ure” has oc­curred, caus­ing mid­dle-aged lo­cal</p>
    <p>PMEs to be­come more vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>Tra­di­tion­ally, PMEs have not felt they need ex­tra pro­tec­tion, and many of them ne­go­ti­ate their own in­di­vid­ual em­ploy­ment con­tracts and chart out their own ca­reers, noted Mr Ng.</p>
    <p>But since about two years ago, he said, more ma­ture PMEs in their 40s to 60s have been shar­ing their anx­i­ety and frus­tra­tions with him as they find it hard to get a job if they are re­trenched, and worry about job se­cu­rity while they are em­ployed. And they are even more af­fected in an economic down­turn.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully we can jig mar­ket forces from all dif­fer­ent lev­els so that we can move for­ward to achieve economic suc­cess and also eq­ui­table distri­bu­tion of jobs to PMEs that are lo­cal,” said Mr Ng.</p>
    <p>Data from the Min­istry of Man­power shows that pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs) typ­i­cally have a lower than av­er­age rate of re-en­try into em­ploy­ment within six months of be­ing re­trenched.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay, a labour MP, said he will work to­wards lev­el­ling the play­ing field for lo­cal PMEs.</p>
    <p>“The key is that our lo­cals – in terms of hir­ing, re­ten­tion, re­trench­ment – should be treated fairly,” he said.</p>
    <p>His sense is that lo­cal PMEs are not com­plain­ing about com­pa­nies that em­ploy top for­eign bankers who bring in mil­lions in in­vest­ments, but rather those that hire for­eign­ers for less spe­cialised roles</p>
    <p>The key is that our lo­cals – in terms of hir­ing, re­ten­tion, re­trench­ment – should be treated fairly. which any­one can do.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng cau­tioned that a bal­ance needs to be struck be­tween the mi­cro-level con­cerns of in­di­vid­ual Sin­ga­pore­ans and the macro-level needs of the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Swing too far on one side and Sin­ga­porean PMEs may feel they do not have fair ac­cess to jobs.</p>
    <p>But get­ting it wrong in the other di­rec­tion will af­fect Sin­ga­pore’s abil­ity to be a vi­brant econ­omy that at­tracts the top tal­ent in the world and the needed num­ber of work­ers, he said.</p>
    <p>“If we get this bal­ance wrong, ei­ther way our econ­omy will not be at the op­ti­mal state to move for­ward.”</p>
    <p>He added that NTUC wants to work with the Gov­ern­ment to re­view for­eign man­power pol­icy op­tions. Th­ese could in­clude a dif­fer­en­ti­ated quota for Em­ploy­ment Pass hold­ers at dif­fer­ent salary lev­els.</p>
    <p>The labour move­ment has been ex­pand­ing its en­gage­ment with PMEs in re­cent years, such as through its U As­so­ci­ate scheme with pro­fes­sional bod­ies, which fo­cuses on grow­ing PMEs’ net­works.</p>
    <p>Rank-and-file unions can rep­re­sent PMEs in col­lec­tive bar­gain­ing, and there are also PME unions such as the Port Of­fi­cers’ Union and the Air Trans­port Ex­ec­u­tive Staff Union.</p>
    <p>But this lat­est push is the most con­certed ef­fort so far to help this group of work­ers in the area of pro­tec­tion, said Mr Ng.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay said that even af­ter the rec­om­men­da­tions are pre­sented, NTUC hopes to have a stronger re­la­tion­ship with PMEs to be a col­lec­tive voice for them and their is­sues.</p>
    <p>SNEF’s Mr Yap said that al­though em­ploy­ers have immediate con­cerns about busi­ness sur­vival, they are also think­ing about how to re­tain and build ca­pa­bil­i­ties for economic recovery.</p>
    <p>“In work­ing with NTUC, SNEF hopes that we can de­velop Sin­ga­porean PMEs, es­pe­cially those aged 40 to 60, that would meet em­ploy­ers’ skills demand in the fu­ture econ­omy. Em­ploy­ers should up­skill and reskill their ma­ture PMEs to en­able them to con­trib­ute to their busi­ness more im­pact­fully,” he said.</p>
    <p>FAIR TREAT­MENT</p>
    <p>’’ MR PA­TRICK TAY, labour MP and NTUC as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral.</p>
