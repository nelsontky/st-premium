    <p>When things get stress­ful, many peo­ple turn to sweets and desserts for com­fort.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the re­cent run on bak­ing sup­plies at the height of the coro­n­avirus cri­sis here, many patis­series and cafes are also re­port­ing healthy sales.</p>
    <p>Gift­ing and send­ing care pack­ages to fam­ily and friends have boosted on­line sales, as baked goods travel well and are wel­come any time of the day.</p>
    <p>Tarte by Ch­eryl Koh in Shaw Cen­tre, which is un­der the Les Amis Group, started is­land­wide de­liv­ery dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker and has con­tin­ued to see strong de­mand for on­line or­ders.</p>
    <p>The best­sellers are its fruit tarts, which cost about $13 each.</p>
    <p>Ms Koh said: “We were able to reach out to a dif­fer­ent de­mo­graphic who has not dined in with us be­fore.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, more peo­ple were buy­ing our pas­tries and prod­ucts as gifts for friends, fam­ily and col­leagues as a way to up­lift spir­its, and cel­e­brate birth­days and an­niver­saries.”</p>
    <p>Cor­po­rate or­ders surged too, in­clud­ing a reg­u­lar pa­tron – who asked to re­main anony­mous – who or­dered a con­stant stream of pas­tries to en­cour­age health­care work­ers and those in need.</p>
    <p>Its dine-in cafe is now usu­ally full even on week­days. To­tal sales from de­liv­ery, take­away and dine-in are up to 21/ times what they were</p>
    <p>2 be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>There are plans to open a take­away out­let at Raf­fles City, said Ms Koh.</p>
    <p>Bacha Cof­fee, which comes from Morocco and opened its first cafe at Ion Or­chard in Septem­ber last year, is also fully packed most of the time. It has a cof­fee bar and re­tail bou­tique at Takashimay­a de­part­ment store, as well as a re­tail bou­tique at the air­port.</p>
    <p>Its cafe sports strik­ing tones of saf­fron and in­digo, black-and­white mar­ble floors and ge­o­met­ric­pat­terned lat­tice­work, in­spired by the orig­i­nal cafe in the Dar el Bacha Palace in Mar­rakesh.</p>
    <p>It spe­cialises in Ara­bica cof­fee from around the world and serves food and pas­tries, i nclud­ing its sig­na­ture crois­sants.</p>
    <p>Op­er­a­tions man­ager In­grid Le­boeuf said vis­its to the cof­fee room and cof­fee bar have seen “steady growth” since phase two of the econ­omy’s re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>“In the wake of Covid-19, we have no­ticed that cus­tomers are look­ing for beau­ti­ful places where they can take a ‘voy­age’ from work­ing from home.” she said. “Ev­ery­one is tired</p>
    <p>Many of the tart or­ders were sent as birth­day and fes­tive gifts dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, which was very heart­warm­ing. This was prob­a­bly one of the best ways to con­vey care and con­cern when we could not be phys­i­cally in touch.</p>
    <p>and stressed. They ap­pre­ci­ate the change to es­cape from re­al­ity for a while.”</p>
    <p>She added that the out­lets see many re­turn­ing cus­tomers. The cafe’s busiest hours are from its open­ing time at 9.30am to late af­ter­noon. The only lull is on week­day evenings when it is per­haps too late for caf­feine, hence a shorter wait for ta­bles.</p>
    <p>For­mer on­line bak­ery Patis­serie Cle, which opened in March at Paya Le­bar Of­fice, has also en­joyed ro­bust sales.</p>
    <p>It is the first bricks-and-mor­tar shop by Ms Joy Chiam and Ms Ger­maine Li, who had been bak­ing from home for more than a year be­fore that.</p>
    <p>Ms Chiam used to work at Joel Robu­chon Restau­rant, while Ms Li</p>
    <p>was the pas­try chef of Les Amis. Sales have in­creased two- to three­fold since they opened their take­away shop, said Ms Chiam.</p>
    <p>She added: “Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, 70 per cent of or­ders were for gifts, with de­liv­er­ies sent to a dif­fer­ent ad­dress from the cus­tomer’s.</p>
    <p>“We were lucky that we had a ready on­line plat­form and de­liv­ery net­work be­cause we were a vir­tual busi­ness. And be­cause we do not have dine-in, we were not ad­versely af­fected by the cir­cuit breaker.”</p>
    <p>Top sell­ers are their tarts, such as the Orh Blanc Tart, which is a fu­sion of Mont Blanc and orh nee, a Teochew yam dessert. They cost up­wards of $8 each, while a slice of cake goes for $8.50.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan Foods Hold­ing, which owns Ja­panese pas­try cafes Fruit Par­adise in Ang Mo Kio Hub and 111 Som­er­set, as well as Kagu­razaka Saryo in VivoCity, has seen dou­ble-digit growth in sales com­pared with be­fore the pan­demic. In par­tic­u­lar, de­mand for its tarts has gone up three­fold.</p>
    <p>Its spokesman said: “Many of the tart or­ders were sent as birth­day and fes­tive gifts dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, which was very heart­warm­ing. This was prob­a­bly one of the best ways to con­vey care and con­cern when we could not be phys­i­cally in touch.</p>
    <p>“Now, we see more fam­ily groups of three to five com­ing to our out­lets, es­pe­cially on week­ends.”</p>
    <p>Mar­malade Pantry, which has out­lets in Ion Or­chard, Oa­sia Ho­tel Novena and Oa­sia Ho­tel Down­town, has seen rev­enue drop by more than 25 per cent last month com­pared with Jan­uary, be­cause its cus­tomers usu­ally dine in for meals and seat­ing ca­pac­ity has de­creased.</p>
    <p>But it did no­tice an uptick in dessert or­ders for gift­ing. About half of its to­tal de­liv­ery sales came from cup­cakes and other sweet treats.</p>
    <p>Ms Betty Tan, mar­ket­ing di­rec­tor of Re­fin­ery Con­cepts, which owns the cafes, said: “In­creas­ingly, our reg­u­lar cus­tomers who sup­ported us dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker are or­der­ing for their friends rather than for them­selves.”</p>
    <p>The brand is work­ing on more cake flavours for de­liv­ery, as well as a fes­tive col­lec­tion for Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>As it turns out, the hu­man crav­ing for sweets when one is stressed is backed by sci­ence.</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Ver­ena Tan of the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy’s Di­etet­ics and Nu­tri­tion pro­gramme said: “Stress causes the body to re­lease cor­ti­sol, a hor­mone crit­i­cal in man­ag­ing fat stor­age and en­ergy use in the body.</p>
    <p>A SPOKESMAN FOR JA­PAN FOODS HOLD­ING, on the rise in dessert or­ders from its eater­ies</p>
    <p>“Cor­ti­sol is known to in­crease ap­petite and may en­cour­age crav­ings for high-fat and high-sugar foods.”</p>
    <p>When peo­ple eat “com­fort” foods, which are usu­ally high in fat and sugar, there is in­creased pro­duc­tion of sero­tonin.</p>
    <p>Sero­tonin is the body’s feel-good chem­i­cal, which makes peo­ple feel more calm and re­laxed.</p>
    <p>“Stress i ncreases your body’s need for sero­tonin,” said Dr Tan.</p>
    <p>She cau­tioned, how­ever, that these foods can eas­ily l ead to weight gain and rec­om­mended other ways to man­age stress.</p>
    <p>These in­clude phys­i­cal ac­tiv­ity which pro­duces en­dor­phins, another “feel-good” chem­i­cal in the brain that re­duces stress.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan’s mes­sage is clear: In­dulge in mod­er­a­tion and bal­ance it with good old ex­er­cise.</p>
