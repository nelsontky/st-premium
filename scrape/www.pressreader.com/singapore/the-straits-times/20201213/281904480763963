    <p>The Shore Res­i­dences man­age­ment had made “nu­mer­ous” at­tempts since 2018 to visit Madam Lily Loh, whose re­mains were found in the con­do­minium in Am­ber Road last month.</p>
    <p>It had also sought help from the po­lice and rel­e­vant gov­ern­ment and an­i­mal wel­fare agen­cies, as some res­i­dents raised con­cerns about her well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the condo man­age­ment, MCST 4104, told The Sun­day Times: “Very of­ten, reach­ing out to in­de­pen­dent el­derly res­i­dents can have its own chal­lenges.”</p>
    <p>He added that as re­peated at­tempts to con­tact Madam Loh at her house were un­suc­cess­ful, le­gal let­ters for un­paid man­age­ment fees were served to her at her doorstep.</p>
    <p>On Oct 1, it filed a po­lice re­port af­ter fail­ing to lo­cate her.</p>
    <p>On Nov 23, the po­lice found the re­mains of Madam Loh and her dog in her apart­ment. She was said to be around 80 years old.</p>
    <p>It is not clear what hap­pened in the close to two months be­tween Oct 1 and Nov 23, as po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions are still on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>Neigh­bours in­ter­viewed by the me­dia said they last saw her al­most two years ago.</p>
    <p>About two years ago, Mr Lim Biow Chuan, MP for Mount­bat­ten, alerted the po­lice af­ter the condo’s man­age­ment con­tacted him for help, but the po­lice said Madam Loh was ag­i­tated when they went to check on her.</p>
    <p>The po­lice left af­ter as­cer­tain­ing that noth­ing was amiss.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim later asked a so­cial worker to check on her. She told the so­cial worker she was all right and did not want to be vis­ited by help agen­cies, Mr Lim told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>He said: “We can’t com­pel peo­ple to re­ceive vis­i­tors to check on them. If you are not re­cep­tive, there is a limit to what oth­ers can do (to help you).”</p>
    <p>Madam Loh’s prop­erty agent, Mr Stephen Lee, 65, de­scribed her as a very pri­vate per­son who was al­ways alone.</p>
    <p>His last in­ter­ac­tion with her was about five years ago, when he helped her to sell her old apart­ment and buy the two-bed­room unit at The Shore Res­i­dences.</p>
    <p>He said: “She was quite frail but she had a good ap­petite.”</p>
    <p>To his knowl­edge, Madam Loh was un­mar­ried and had a brother, though they did not seem close.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee was in­tro­duced to her by his sis­ter, who met her by chance at Novena Church. Madam Loh had left her bag be­hind at a food­court near the church and Mr Lee’s sis­ter had re­turned it.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said he had to ask his sis­ters to help Madam Loh clean her apart­ment each time there was a po­ten­tial buyer who wanted to view it. “Her place was a mess,” he said. “You can’t help but feel sorry for her.”</p>
