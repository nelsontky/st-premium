    <p>ROME • Pope Fran­cis has stripped the Vat­i­can’s most pow­er­ful of­fice of its sig­nif­i­cant fi­nan­cial as­sets, after du­bi­ous in­vest­ments squan­dered mil­lions of eu­ros in church do­na­tions and sparked off an em­bar­rass­ing scandal that has prompted a cor­rup­tion probe.</p>
    <p>The Vat­i­can said a new law en­acted by the Pope on Mon­day or­ders the Sec­re­tar­iat of State – the diplo­matic and ad­min­is­tra­tive arm of the Holy See – to trans­fer all its fi­nan­cial hold­ings and real es­tate as­sets to the Ad­min­is­tra­tion of the Pat­ri­mony of the Apos­tolic See, which han­dles the Vat­i­can’s fi­nances, by Feb 4.</p>
    <p>The changes fol­low a Vat­i­can in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the mis­man­age­ment of funds by the Sec­re­tar­iat of State. One of its most prom­i­nent in­vest­ments in­volved the pur­chase of a London prop­erty that was bought in part with money do­nated by the faith­ful.</p>
    <p>In 2014, the sec­re­tar­iat in­vested about €200 mil­lion (S$325.2 mil­lion) as a part­ner in a deal to buy a lux­ury build­ing in London. As the deal be­came oner­ous, it paid tens of mil­lions of fees to mid­dle­men in at­tempts to change the terms.</p>
    <p>Car­di­nal Ge­orge Pell, the Vat­i­can’s for­mer trea­surer, told Reuters ear­lier this month there had been “enor­mous losses”.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber l ast year, Vat­i­can pros­e­cu­tors or­dered a raid on the of­fices of the Vat­i­can’s bank­ing reg­u­la­tor as part of an in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the pur­chase. That led to the res­ig­na­tion of the Vat­i­can’s chief of se­cu­rity, the re­moval of sev­eral Vat­i­can em­ploy­ees and of­fi­cials, and the ar­rest of an Ital­ian banker in­volved in the trans­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>No one has been charged in the case, how­ever, and the banker has been re­leased.</p>
    <p>The changes an­nounced on Mon­day are also in line with Pope Fran­cis’ agenda to re­form the Vat­i­can’s ad­min­is­tra­tion, a task that has proved to be a huge chal­lenge in the nearly eight years since he be­came Pope, in part be­cause of push­back from bu­reau­crats.</p>
    <p>A pre­am­ble to the law said the de­ci­sion to re­voke the sec­re­tar­iat’s fund­ing was taken to en­sure “better or­gan­i­sa­tion of the ad­min­is­tra­tion, con­trols and su­per­vi­sion of the eco­nomic and fi­nan­cial ac­tiv­i­ties of the Holy See”, more “trans­par­ent and ef­fi­cient man­age­ment” and a “clear sep­a­ra­tion of re­spon­si­bil­i­ties and func­tions”.</p>
    <p>It noted that other depart­ments al­ready han­dle fi­nan­cial and eco­nomic mat­ters.</p>
    <p>The law also calls for the cre­ation of a new fund for do­na­tions to the Pope that had pre­vi­ously been man­aged by the Sec­re­tar­iat of State, to en­sure “greater con­trol and better vis­i­bil­ity”.</p>
    <p>The Vat­i­can’s Econ­omy Min­istry will over­see spending.</p>
