    <p>Six peo­ple have been fined $3,000 each for tak­ing part in an un­law­ful gath­er­ing on Lazarus Is­land amid the Covid-19 out­break on Aug 8.</p>
    <p>They were part of a 12-per­son gath­er­ing on the is­land that vi­o­lated Covid-19 reg­u­la­tions, which pro­hib­ited so­cial gath­er­ings of more than five peo­ple who do not live in the same res­i­dence.</p>
    <p>Na­talie Joanna Sarkies, 29; Zoe Louise Cronk, 30; Jeff Richard Alexan­der, 32; Lowri Mair Jeffs, 31; Richard Henri Lagesse, 31; and Wil­liam Ed­win Dun­ford, 32, each pleaded guilty yes­ter­day to an of­fence un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act.</p>
    <p>Sarkies is a Sin­ga­porean while the rest are Bri­tish.</p>
    <p>Alexan­der, Jeffs and Dun­ford were rep­re­sented by Mr Shafi­ud­din Ong from Emer­ald Law, while Sarkies, Cronk and Lagesse were un­rep­re­sented.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments, the group of 12 took a ferry from main­land Sin­ga­pore to St John’s Is­land at 11am on Aug 8.</p>
    <p>Once there, they walked to Lazarus Is­land, which is linked to St John’s Is­land by a man-made cause­way. They then en­gaged in var­i­ous leisure ac­tiv­i­ties, be­fore tak­ing a ferry from St John’s Is­land back to main­land Sin­ga­pore at around 6pm.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Sarkies posted pho­to­graphs of the trip on so­cial me­dia platform In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>The pho­to­graphs were sub­se­quently re­ported on var­i­ous me­dia plat­forms, at­tract­ing pub­lic at­ten­tion and caus­ing pub­lic alarm, said Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tor (DPP) Ti­motheus Koh.</p>
    <p>Urg­ing the court to fine each in­di­vid­ual $3,000, the DPP said in his sen­tenc­ing submission­s that the case was com­pa­ra­ble to an ear­lier in­ci­dent in­volv­ing 12 other peo­ple gath­er­ing i n Kal­lang. Each of­fender i n that case was fined $3,000.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong dis­agreed, sub­mit­ting in mit­i­ga­tion that his clients should each be fined $2,500 in­stead. He ar­gued that a dis­tinc­tion should be made be­tween the present case, which oc­curred dur­ing phase two of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing, and the ear­lier case, which hap­pened dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>An­other mem­ber of the group, 32-year-old Bri­ton Paul Jonathon Gold, was fined $3,000 on Oct 14.</p>
    <p>The cases for the re­main­ing five – He­len Ann Sul­li­van, 30; Joshua Adam Roth, 31; James Riby Oram Trim­ming, 31; Luong Thi Thu Ha, 31; and Ed­ward John Joseph LeeBull, 32 – are pend­ing.</p>
    <p>If found guilty of the of­fence un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act, first-time of­fend­ers can be jailed for up to six months or fined up to $10,000, or both.</p>
    <p>Re­peat of­fend­ers can be jailed for up to a year or fined up to $20,000, or both.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments, the group of 12 took a ferry from main­land Sin­ga­pore to St John’s Is­land at 11am on Aug 8. Once there, the group walked to Lazarus Is­land, which is linked to St John’s Is­land by a man-made cause­way. They then en­gaged in var­i­ous leisure ac­tiv­i­ties, be­fore tak­ing a ferry from St John’s Is­land back to main­land Sin­ga­pore at around 6pm.</p>
