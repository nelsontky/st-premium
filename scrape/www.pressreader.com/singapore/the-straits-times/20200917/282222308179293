    <p>Readers of The Sun­day Times the past week­end were greeted with a dra­matic pic­ture of a lone fire­fighter on the front page bat­tling the wild­fires rag­ing across the three states lin­ing the west coast of the United States.</p>
    <p>Flip to the third page and one would have seen a news re­port on Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) con­sid­er­ing hav­ing “flights to nowhere” in order to boost its pan­demic-hit busi­ness (SIA eye­ing ‘flights to nowhere’ to give a lift to ail­ing busi­ness,</p>
    <p>Sept 13).</p>
    <p>The re­port touched on sev­eral points but there was no men­tion of the car­bon emis­sions that would be dumped into the at­mos­phere.</p>
    <p>Green­house gas emis­sions from flights have been well doc­u­mented. Do we want to add to this un­nec­es­sary burn­ing of fuel while parts of the world are lit­er­ally on fire?</p>
    <p>In the past year, we have seen mas­sive fires sweep­ing across the globe due to cli­mate change – from pre­vi­ously freez­ing Siberia way up north to Aus­tralia in the South­ern Hemi­sphere.</p>
    <p>Per­haps SIA could con­duct a study to find out the level of emis­sions that would arise from the no-des­ti­na­tion flights, as well as the po­ten­tial im­pact.</p>
    <p>Even then, with ef­forts to re­duce car­bon diox­ide emis­sions al­ready so dif­fi­cult, why add to the chal­lenge? Is there no bet­ter way to boost busi­ness?</p>
    <p>And to peo­ple who are con­sid­er­ing tak­ing such flights, con­sider the po­ten­tial back­lash.</p>
    <p>Even if the back­lash for both com­pany and cus­tomers does not hap­pen right away, it will come one day as more and more peo­ple re­alise the dire sit­u­a­tion we are in and in­dif­fer­ence turns into anger and blame.</p>
    <p>Con­sider this: In the past, paint­ing one’s face “black” was not taboo and was in­stead con­sid­ered ac­cept­able in the name of a good laugh. To­day, it is an in­stant path to pari­ah­dom, and those guilty of such deeds in the past are not spared ei­ther.</p>
    <p>Think of how “flights to nowhere” will look 10 years from now as the more po­tent ef­fects of cli­mate change be­gin to hit us.</p>
    <p>Be on the right side of his­tory – do the right thing.</p>
