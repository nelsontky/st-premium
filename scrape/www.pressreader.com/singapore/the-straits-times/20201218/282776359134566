    <p>The stars of up­com­ing sci­encefic­tion K-drama Sweet Home, which pre­mieres on Net­flix to­day, had to go through rig­or­ous work­outs and train­ing to be con­vinc­ing mon­ster slayers.</p>
    <p>Based on the hit Web comic of the same name, the thrilling se­ries about res­i­dents of an apart­ment build­ing who have to bat­tle mon­sters was a chal­lenge for Song Kang (Love Alarm, 2019 to present). He plays reclu­sive teen pro­tag­o­nist Hyun-soo, who mys­te­ri­ously gains su­per­pow­ers to fight the mon­sters.</p>
    <p>The 26-year-old trained for two months be­fore film­ing be­gan.</p>
    <p>He says in an on­line group in­ter­view with re­gional press: “It was my first time do­ing any sort of wire ac­tion and it’s tough. I felt like I had lost all con­trol and I would be com­pletely ex­hausted af­ter one scene.</p>
    <p>“For ev­ery ac­tion scene I did, I met our ac­tion di­rec­tor an hour be­fore to re­hearse it.”</p>
    <p>The mon­sters in the se­ries are hu­mans trans­formed into their se­cret de­sires. Asked what sort of mon­ster he might be­come, he says: “I love go­ing to the gym, so prob­a­bly a weights mon­ster.”</p>
    <p>Song’s co-star, ac­tress Lee Siy­oung (Killer Toon, 2013), says she would be­come a mon­ster that eats ev­ery­thing.</p>
    <p>The 38-year-old ac­tress spent six months train­ing with weights and do­ing mar­tial arts to get the mus­cu­lar body she shows off in the se­ries as I-kyung – a fire­fighter and for­mer spe­cial forces sol­dier.</p>
    <p>Lee, who used to box out­side of act­ing, says of the pow­er­ful char­ac­ter she plays: “Of course, I fo­cused on my act­ing to play some­one so con­fi­dent and strong, but I also made sure I had a fit physique. On top of the train­ing I re­ceived, I did push-ups, work­outs like rolling tyres around and climb­ing ropes.”</p>
    <p>Lee Do-hyun (18 Again, 2020), the 25-year-old ac­tor who plays a young med­i­cal stu­dent and the brains among the res­i­dents, did not get to see as much ac­tion.</p>
    <p>But one of his most mem­o­rable scenes in­volves him fight­ing.</p>
    <p>He says: “There was a scene in an un­der­ground carpark where I had to fight off mon­sters in a car. We filmed that dur­ing win­ter, un­der­ground, so you can imag­ine how cold it was. And fight­ing within an en­closed space like a car and hav­ing to drive – do­ing all of that at the same time was a real chal­lenge.”</p>
    <p>For Lee Jin-wook, usu­ally known for play­ing the hand­some lead­ing man in ro­mance se­ries such as The Time We Were Not In Love (2015), get­ting into the mind­set of his char­ac­ter was harder.</p>
    <p>The 39-year-old plays against type as the rugged, mys­te­ri­ous Sang-wook, who prefers to solve prob­lems with his fists.</p>
    <p>“He is quite an anti-so­cial char­ac­ter, but I’m very much a peo­ple per­son. So, to pre­pare for the role, I tried to cut back on in­ter­per­sonal re­la­tion­ships and see how it would be like to lead a more reclu­sive life.”</p>
    <p>While the se­ries fea­tures an en­sem­ble cast that in­cludes Kim Namhee, Go Min-si, Park Gyu-young and Go Yoon-jung, the menagerie of mon­sters is also a key draw.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral A-list Hol­ly­wood spe­cial ef­fects teams were roped in for Sweet Home, in­clud­ing Le­gacy Ef­fects – known for its work on the Avengers film se­ries (2012 to 2019) – and Spec­tral Mo­tion (Stranger Things, 2016 to present). West­world, a top visual ef­fects team in South Korea, also worked on the tech­ni­cally de­mand­ing se­ries.</p>
    <p>Di­rec­tor Lee Eung-bok, known for helm­ing top se­ries like Goblin (2016 to 2017) and Mr Sun­shine (2018), says there is hardly a scene with­out com­puter graph­ics in Sweet Home.</p>
    <p>“This sort of crea­ture live-ac­tion se­ries is very rare in South Korea,</p>
    <p>On top of the train­ing I re­ceived, I did push-ups, work­outs like rolling tyres around and climb­ing ropes.</p>
    <p>AC­TRESS LEE SI-YOUNG (left), who spent six months train­ing with weights and do­ing mar­tial arts for her role as a fire­fighter and for­mer spe­cial forces sol­dier and even our fail­ures in the process of ex­per­i­ment­ing with the visual ef­fects were very fun,” he says.</p>
    <p>Re­cent cel­e­brated South Korean mon­ster and zom­bie ti­tles in­clude King­dom (2019 to present), Train To Bu­san (2016) and The School Nurse Files (2020).</p>
    <p>As to how his work stands out, he says: “In Sweet Home, you can never guess which mon­sters you’ll be up against. Be­cause the mon­sters are man­i­fes­ta­tions of some­one’s hid­den de­sires, it’ll be dif­fer­ent from per­son to per­son.”</p>
