    <p>The wife of a Sats of­fi­cer who died of food poi­son­ing af­ter eat­ing a bento set from Spize is su­ing the food and bev­er­age es­tab­lish­ment and a re­lated firm for dam­ages.</p>
    <p>Madam Noor Hi­dayu Md Ishak, 37, is claim­ing more than $631,000 from Spize and Spize Events for the death of Mr Mo­hamad Fadli Mohd Saleh, 38.</p>
    <p>In doc­u­ments filed in the High Court ob­tained by The Sun­day Times, Madam Noor Hi­dayu is claim­ing the two firms were neg­li­gent in caus­ing the death of her hus­band, the fam­ily’s sole bread­win­ner.</p>
    <p>She said they had breached a duty of care owed to Mr Mo­hamad Fadli, a father of two, by pre­par­ing and de­liv­er­ing food that was “se­verely con­tam­i­nated and un­fit or un­safe for hu­man con­sump­tion”.</p>
    <p>In pa­pers filed in its de­fence, Spize said any gas­troen­teri­tis Mr Mo­hamad Fadli suf­fered from was caused or con­trib­uted to by his own neg­li­gence, not­ing that he had eaten the bento set past the rec­om­mended “con­sume-by” pe­riod, and that he had not sought im­me­di­ate med­i­cal at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Mo­hamad Fadli died on Nov 14, 2018, of sep­sis and mul­ti­ple or­gan fail­ure from acute gas­troen­teri­tis, af­ter eat­ing the bento set pre­pared by Spize’s River Val­ley out­let, a coro­ner’s re­port found.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 221 peo­ple ate food pre­pared by the same out­let be­tween Nov 6 and 9 that year, of which 82 peo­ple fell ill.</p>
    <p>The two com­pa­nies share a board of di­rec­tors, with Spize Events then op­er­at­ing the River Val­ley out­let and Spize han­dling food cater­ing.</p>
    <p>The op­er­at­ing li­cences of the</p>
    <p>The sum that Madam Noor Hi­dayu Md Ishak is seek­ing in­cludes the amount re­quired to sup­port their son and daugh­ter, who were nine and 11 re­spec­tively at the time of Mr Mo­hamad Fadli Mohd Saleh’s death. As his par­ents’ only son, Mr Mo­hamad Fadli was also pro­vid­ing for his 61-year-old father and 58-year-old mother.</p>
    <p>River Val­ley out­let was ter­mi­nated in De­cem­ber that year fol­low­ing the food poi­son­ing in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>In her state­ment of claims filed in July this year, Madam Noor Hi­dayu said in­spec­tions by the Min­istry of Health (MOH), the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) and other agen­cies on Nov 7 and Nov 14 re­vealed var­i­ous hy­giene lapses.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the food used by both com­pa­nies was con­tam­i­nated with sal­mo­nella and fae­cal bac­te­ria was found in ready-to-eat bela­can egg fried rice and on kitchen tools, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>The sum that Madam Noor Hi­dayu is seek­ing in­cludes the amount re­quired to sup­port their son and daugh­ter, who were nine and 11 re­spec­tively at the time of Mr Mo­hamad Fadli’s death.</p>
    <p>As his par­ents’ only son, Mr Mo­hamad Fadli was also pro­vid­ing for his 61-year-old father and 58-yearold mother.</p>
    <p>Mr Mo­hamad Fadli had eaten the bento set in the af­ter­noon of Nov 6, 2018, dur­ing a Deep­avali cel­e­bra­tion. He suf­fered from se­vere ab­dom­i­nal pains, vom­it­ing and di­ar­rhoea be­tween 6pm and 7 pm that day.</p>
    <p>He col­lapsed on Nov 8 and was ad­mit­ted to a hos­pi­tal where he died de­spite med­i­cal at­ten­tion in the in­ten­sive care unit, ac­cord­ing to the Madam Noor Hi­dayu, who is rep­re­sented by Niru & Co.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Spize and Spize Events, rep­re­sented by Joseph Tan Jude Benny, claimed Mr Mo­hamad Fadli had eaten the food at least two hours af­ter the stated “con­sumeby” pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The rec­om­mended pe­riod was</p>
    <p>“clearly in­di­cated” on the in­voice for the food, said the com­pa­nies in their de­fence, and the in­voice con­tained a dis­claimer that Spize “would not be li­able for per­sons who con­sumed the bento sets af­ter the rec­om­mended pe­riod”, added the firms in their de­fence.</p>
    <p>The com­pa­nies also noted that Mr Mo­hamad Fadli had de­layed seek­ing med­i­cal treat­ment un­til Nov 7, de­spite hav­ing a high fever of 39.9 deg C on Nov 6.</p>
    <p>Spize also said the in­spec­tion by MOH and NEA did not re­veal that the sal­mo­nella strain de­tected in its premises was also present in the bento boxes that were de­liv­ered to Mr Mo­hamad Fadli’s work­place.</p>
    <p>A pre-trial con­fer­ence will be held in the High Court next month.</p>
