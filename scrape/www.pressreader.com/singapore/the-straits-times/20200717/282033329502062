    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Demo­cratic Party (SDP) yes­ter­day called for an in­de­pen­dent in­quiry into how the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion was con­ducted, cit­ing mis­takes, mis­steps and mis­di­rec­tions, in­clud­ing an in­ci­dent where a woman was wrongly pre­vented from vot­ing.</p>
    <p>The Elec­tions Depart­ment (ELD) ear­lier said that “hu­man er­ror and mis­com­mu­ni­ca­tion” had led to a woman, known only as Madam Lum, be­ing un­able to cast her vote on Polling Day in Hol­land-Bukit Timah GRC.</p>
    <p>At the polling sta­tion, she was told that she had al­ready voted. Madam Lum then re­port­edly filled out a “ten­dered bal­lot pa­per” – typ­i­cally is­sued when some­one ap­plies to vote de­spite the reg­is­ter in­di­cat­ing that the per­son’s vote had al­ready been cast.</p>
    <p>In a press state­ment is­sued yes­ter­day, SDP chair­man Paul Tam­byah said: “We call for the ELD to re­veal how many such ir­reg­u­lar events hap­pened dur­ing the poll, and an in­de­pen­dent in­quiry into the con­duct of the elec­tion, with a par­tic­u­lar fo­cus on is­sues such as the use of ‘ten­dered bal­lot slips’ which ap­par­ently were not counted in this elec­tion.”</p>
    <p>The Par­lia­men­tary Elec­tions Act states that ten­dered bal­lot pa­pers are not counted by the Re­turn­ing Of­fi­cer, but placed in sep­a­rate pack­ets ac­cord­ing to the can­di­date or group of can­di­dates they sup­port. The pack­ets are sealed and re­tained un­less re­quired for the pur­poses of an ap­pli­ca­tion to void the re­sults of an elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Prof Tam­byah added: “From the long queues at sev­eral count­ing sta­tions to the chang­ing in­struc­tions on the use of dis­pos­able gloves to the lack of ad­vance in­for­ma­tion about the need for per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment for polling agents from 7pm and of­ten con­flict­ing in­struc­tions for that hour at the polling sta­tions, cou­pled with the sud­den and un­ex­pected an­nounce­ment about the ex­ten­sion of polling hours, this elec­tion has been fraught with mis­steps, mis­takes and mis­di­rec­tions.”</p>
    <p>The SDP chair­man also said that the in­quiry should be re­viewed by all the po­lit­i­cal par­ties that took part in the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent in­volv­ing Madam Lum in Hol­land-Bukit Timah GRC came to light shortly af­ter the elec­tion. The ELD on Wed­nes­day said it had in­ves­ti­gated the in­ci­dent and found that her NRIC was not used to reg­is­ter to vote on Polling Day.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the Pre­sid­ing Of­fi­cer had failed to reg­is­ter Madam Lum’s iden­tity card be­cause the of­fi­cer “had not switched out of the wrong mod­ule of the e-Reg­is­tra­tion sys­tem, which he had used to serve the pre­vi­ous voter”.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cer es­ca­lated the mat­ter to the As­sis­tant Re­turn­ing Of­fi­cer but a “mis­com­mu­ni­ca­tion” be­tween the of­fi­cers led the As­sis­tant Re­turn­ing Of­fi­cer “to in­ter­pret that Madam Lum’s NRIC num­ber had al­ready been used to reg­is­ter for vot­ing ear­lier in the day”. “This was then wrongly com­mu­ni­cated to Madam Lum,” the ELD said.</p>
    <p>It added that Madam Lum was re­lieved the is­sue has been clar­i­fied, and said it would re­store her name to the voter rolls with­out penalty. She had filed a po­lice re­port af­ter the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>The PAP beat the SDP team in Hol­land-Bukit Timah GRC, gain­ing 66.36 per cent of the votes.</p>
    <p>The ELD ear­lier said that it would con­duct a re­view. Head of ELD Koh Siong Ling, re­spond­ing to a Fo­rum let­ter pub­lished in The Straits Times de­scrib­ing an hour­long wait to vote, said on Mon­day: “We will con­duct a thor­ough re­view to un­der­stand what went wrong and why they hap­pened, es­pe­cially at some polling sta­tions.”</p>
