    <p>I bought a seven-year-old car re­cently and am hav­ing trou­ble with its fad­ing plas­tic trim. Some ar­eas have white streaks on them too. Is it nor­mal for dis­col­oration on plas­tic parts to oc­cur? What can I do?</p>
    <p>Good-qual­ity plas­tic trim on the ex­te­rior of cars main­tain their colour for sev­eral years.</p>
    <p>But on some cars, there is a ten­dency for the trim to look faded or turn grey af­ter be­ing ex­posed to the el­e­ments for a few years.</p>
    <p>White streaks on the sills are likely caused by wax or pol­ish that was ap­plied on the body­work. Wax on plas­tics should be cleaned away im­me­di­ately or they will leave a white residue that will later be dif­fi­cult to get rid of.</p>
    <p>Hence, take care when wax­ing the paint­work by mask­ing any black plas­tic trim that could get con­tam­i­nated.</p>
    <p>The only way to re­fur­bish black plas­tic trim is by us­ing clean­ing/dress­ing liq­uids meant for plas­tics. There are a num­ber of well-known brands, but sil­i­cone-based ones usu­ally of­fer the best re­sults.</p>
    <p>Which­ever prod­uct you buy, try it on a small ob­scure area first.</p>
    <p>The end re­sult will, of course, depend on how well you fol­low the man­u­fac­turer’s in­struc­tions.</p>
