    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysia’s econ­omy shrank by less than ex­pected in the third quar­ter from a year ear­lier as con­sumers in­creased spend­ing and busi­nesses re­sumed ac­tiv­ity af­ter the gov­ern­ment eased some coro­n­avirus curbs, the cen­tral bank said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy con­tracted 2.7 per cent in the July-to-Septem­ber pe­riod, less than the 3.2 per cent fore­cast in a Reuters poll.</p>
    <p>Gross do­mes­tic prod­uct had dropped 17.1 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter, mark­ing the coun­try’s first eco­nomic con­trac­tion since the 2009 global fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy im­proved sig­nif­i­cantly in the third quar­ter as busi­nesses and employment picked up, pro­vid­ing a boost for do­mes­tic spend­ing and ac­tiv­ity across most sec­tors, Bank Ne­gara Malaysia said.</p>
    <p>“Go­ing into 2021, growth will re­bound, sup­ported by a pickup in global de­mand and nor­mal­i­sa­tion in do­mes­tic eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties,” Bank Ne­gara gov­er­nor Nor Sham­siah Mohd Yunus said at a vir­tual news con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Pri­vate con­sump­tion fell at a slower pace of 2.6 per cent in the third quar­ter af­ter see­ing a 5.6 per cent de­cline in the pre­vi­ous three months, while gross ex­ports jumped 4.4 per cent in the July-toSeptem­ber pe­riod af­ter shrink­ing 15.1 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Malaysia saw its worst slump in over a decade in the sec­ond quar­ter, as strict move­ment curbs aimed at con­tain­ing the coro­n­avirus crip­pled pri­vate con­sump­tion and hurt busi­ness ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>But the econ­omy has since shown ten­ta­tive signs of re­cov­ery driven by a pickup in man­u­fac­tur­ing and ex­ports in the third quar­ter, as busi­nesses re­sumed op­er­a­tions af­ter the gov­ern­ment be­gan grad­u­ally eas­ing some re­stric­tions from May.</p>
    <p>Mon­e­tary and fis­cal stim­u­lus has also helped cush­ion the blow, but an­a­lysts worry that the gov­ern­ment’s move to reim­pose coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions from last month as cases surged could hurt the out­look.</p>
