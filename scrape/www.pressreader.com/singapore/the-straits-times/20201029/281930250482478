    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has con­sis­tently baited the ex­treme right wing dur­ing his pres­i­dency. From retweet­ing ex­treme right ma­te­rial to re­fus­ing to con­demn groups dur­ing pres­i­den­tial de­bates, the con­cern is that by elec­tion time he will have un­leashed a wave of un­con­trol­lable anger that will re­sult in mass civil un­rest.</p>
    <p>This is un­likely, but it is equally likely that no mat­ter the out­come of the elec­tion, vi­o­lence of some sort will fol­low.</p>
    <p>The stage has been set for the con­tin­u­a­tion of a per­sis­tent prob­lem in Amer­ica that will con­tinue to cloud and con­fuse the po­lit­i­cal de­bate and sadly re­sult in do­mes­tic ter­ror­ism.</p>
    <p>This year marks the 25th an­niver­sary of the bomb­ing of the Al­fred P. Mur­rah Fed­eral Build­ing in Ok­la­homa City.</p>
    <p>The at­tack, which killed 168 peo­ple and in­jured al­most 700, re­mains the worse in­ci­dence of do­mes­tic ter­ror­ism the United States has seen.</p>
    <p>The per­pe­tra­tor of the at­tack, Ti­mothy McVeigh, was an un­re­pen­tant mem­ber of the Pa­triot move­ment who feared an op­pres­sive gov­ern­ment was go­ing to take away peo­ple’s guns as a first step to­wards a tyranny.</p>
    <p>He saw his fears re­alised in a se­ries of in­ci­dents in the 1990s when the gov­ern­ment used vi­o­lence against in­di­vid­u­als he be­lieved were sim­ply try­ing to live lives away from the fed­eral gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>His strain of lib­er­tar­i­an­ism is not new to the Amer­i­can po­lit­i­cal dis­course. Founded by men and women who carved out their piece of ter­ri­tory in the Wild West, the US has al­ways seen it­self as a fron­tier na­tion peo­pled by rugged and in­de­pen­dent in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>This has fos­tered a na­tional spirit founded on the im­por­tance of in­de­pen­dence of mind, body and spirit – re­ject­ing cen­tral con­trol and fear­ful of any­thing that im­pedes hu­man devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>This in part helps ex­plain the end­less op­ti­mism and op­por­tu­nity that char­ac­terises Amer­ica. How­ever, it has also meant the ex­is­tence of a deep ten­sion in some parts of Amer­i­can so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Some take these ba­sic so­ci­etal prin­ci­ples to the ex­treme. These are peo­ple who re­ject gov­ern­ment, and be­lieve lives should be lived in­de­pen­dently away from strong cen­tral author­ity.</p>
    <p>They re­ject taxes, rules around ed­u­ca­tion and other stric­tures im­posed by the gov­ern­ment. Those ea­ger to live off the grid are of­ten ar­dent sup­port­ers of gun own­er­ship rights and, more of­ten than not, tend to­wards Repub­li­can pol­i­tics, if they be­lieve in the party sys­tem.</p>
    <p>The Pa­triot move­ment that</p>
    <p>McVeigh emerged from was one that was closely linked with var­i­ous Chris­tian re­li­gious groups and mili­tias that ex­ist in Amer­ica’s re­mote ar­eas.</p>
    <p>These com­mu­ni­ties seek to live self-suf­fi­cient lives out of gov­ern­ment con­trol, though some­times end­ing up mak­ing choices which breach the laws of the land.</p>
    <p>This leads to clashes and con­fronta­tions with the state, most of­ten law en­force­ment at a lo­cal and fed­eral level.</p>
    <p>With McVeigh’s atroc­ity, much greater at­ten­tion was placed on these groups and com­mu­ni­ties, lead­ing to a re­duc­tion in their ca­pa­bil­ity and a num­ber of dis­rup­tions.</p>
    <p>But the prob­lem of ter­ror­ism for US law en­force­ment was up­ended by the events of Sept 11, 2001, which re­fo­cused at­ten­tion on the dan­ger of ex­ter­nal threats.</p>
    <p>The in­ter­nal threats, how­ever, never went away, and the Pa­triot</p>
    <p>move­ment, mili­tias and var­i­ous ex­treme right-wing groups con­tin­ued to fes­ter.</p>
    <p>In the mid-2010s, the Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion high­lighted its grow­ing con­cerns about the sov­er­eign cit­i­zen move­ment, mem­bers of which be­lieve they get to de­cide which laws to obey and which to ig­nore, and think they should not have to pay taxes. The group had de­vel­oped along­side the Pa­triot mi­lieu and sought to use vi­o­lence in some cases to sep­a­rate them­selves from the fed­eral gov­ern­ment. They were part of a broader com­mu­nity that has long ex­isted but of­ten felt marginalis­ed.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has been a boon to such groups.</p>
    <p>Al­ready as­cen­dant prior to his ar­rival, his po­lar­is­ing form of pol­i­tics has merely served to strengthen their sense of con­flict within the coun­try, for which they need to pre­pare.</p>
    <p>This has fos­tered the more pub­lic emer­gence of a range of groups that have long ex­isted in var­i­ous forms – from armed mili­tias around the coun­try such as the Wolver­ine Watch­men, who were plan­ning to kid­nap Michi­gan’s Gov­er­nor Gretchen Whit­mer; groups like the Booga­loo Bois, whose aims are con­fused but talk of­ten of pro­vok­ing a sec­ond Civil War; the Proud Boys, who see them­selves as fighters against left-wing ex­trem­ists; the Oath Keep­ers, made up mostly of for­mer and cur­rent ser­vice­men and po­lice of­fi­cers who be­lieve the gov­ern­ment is fail­ing; to a whole range of vi­o­lent ex­treme-right groups who barely hide their xeno­pho­bic be­liefs.</p>
    <p>The dilemma is what will hap­pen af­ter elec­tion day. Un­for­tu­nately, it is un­likely any good will fol­low.</p>
    <p>If Pres­i­dent Trump wins, such groups will likely feel em­bold­ened. Their sense of im­pend­ing con­flict will be fu­elled by the fact he is likely to con­tinue to see his po­lar­is­ing pol­i­tics as an ef­fec­tive way to gov­ern.</p>
    <p>The likely back­lash from the left and oth­ers an­gry at Mr Trump’s re-elec­tion will only feed their sense of a civil war within the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Should his Demo­cratic chal­lenger Joe Bi­den win, doubt­less they will see an elec­tion stolen. Pres­i­dent Trump’s re­peated com­ments and tweets rais­ing ques­tions about mail-in vot­ing and elec­tion rig­ging have set the tone. His loss will likely speed them on their con­fronta­tional path to­wards vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump may not be the cre­ator of these groups, but he is pro­vid­ing sub­stan­tial suc­cour to them. And whether he wins or loses, they will con­tinue to ex­ist.</p>
    <p>This is not a guar­an­tee there will be vi­o­lence on elec­tion day – though given ten­sions it would not be sur­pris­ing – but it does mean that the prob­lem of an ex­treme right and libertaria­n vi­o­lence will per­sist in Amer­ica af­ter elec­tion day no mat­ter who wins.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem pre­dates Mr Trump and speaks to some­thing deep in some parts of the Amer­i­can psy­che.</p>
    <p>Sadly, nei­ther a Pres­i­dent Trump nor a Pres­i­dent Bi­den will be a salve to soothe this.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump may not be the cre­ator of these groups, but he is pro­vid­ing sub­stan­tial suc­cour to them. And whether he wins or loses, they will con­tinue to ex­ist. This is not a guar­an­tee there will be vi­o­lence on elec­tion day... but it does mean that the prob­lem of an ex­treme right and libertaria­n vi­o­lence will per­sist in Amer­ica af­ter elec­tion day no mat­ter who wins.</p>
