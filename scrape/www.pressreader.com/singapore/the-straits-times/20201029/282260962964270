    <p>PARIS • English Premier League ri­vals Ar­se­nal and Tot­ten­ham are aim­ing to build on win­ning starts in the Europa League today, while Zla­tan Ibrahi­movic will look to trans­fer his scin­til­lat­ing Serie A form to the con­ti­nen­tal stage.</p>
    <p>Smart­ing from their 1-0 loss at home to Le­ices­ter at the week­end, the Gun­ners host Dun­dalk in their sec­ond Group B fix­ture fol­low­ing their 2-1 vic­tory at Rapid Vi­enna.</p>
    <p>Dun­dalk are just the sec­ond Ir­ish rep­re­sen­ta­tive to reach the group stage, hav­ing equalled their maiden achieve­ment in the 2016-17 sea­son and that of Shamrock Rovers in 2011-12.</p>
    <p>They lost 2-1 at home to Nor­way’s Molde in their first game, and although their coach Filippo Gio­vagnoli is aware the odds are stacked against his side, they will give it a go at the Emi­rates.</p>
    <p>“Ar­se­nal have bet­ter play­ers, bet­ter coaches and bet­ter every­thing than us, but this is the chal­lenge,” the Ital­ian said. “We need to play with a lot of heart, run a lot and be a lit­tle crazy and brave.”</p>
    <p>Spurs’ solid start in the Premier League has stirred up talk they could po­ten­tially end a 59-year top-flight ti­tle drought, with no team yet to truly as­sert them­selves af­ter a trun­cated pre-sea­son.</p>
    <p>Man­ager Jose Mour­inho is likely to shuf­fle the pack as Brighton visit just three days later in the league and he has al­ready as­sured Dele Alli, Davin­son Sanchez and Harry Winks – all of whom were not even on the bench in their pre­vi­ous 1-0 win over Burn­ley – that they will get a chance to play at Antwerp today.</p>
    <p>“This is the life of a big club... The boys have to be ready,” the Por­tuguese said ahead of their Group J trip to Belgium.</p>
    <p>Tot­ten­ham had beaten Aus­trian side Lask 3-0 in the open­ing round.</p>
    <p>In Group H, Ibrahi­movic is set to be­come the sec­ond-old­est scorer in Europa League history if he hits the tar­get for AC Mi­lan against Sparta Prague.</p>
    <p>The for­mer Swe­den striker has al­ready scored seven times in five games this sea­son de­spite miss­ing a hand­ful of matches af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus and at 39, he is just a year younger than Daniel Hes­tad, who cur­rently holds the mark.</p>
