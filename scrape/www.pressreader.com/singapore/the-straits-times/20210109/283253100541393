    <p>Pre­cisely ex­e­cuted and de­light­fully ar­tic­u­lated, this home shows how rad­i­cal ideas like a red din­ing room, curv­ing in­te­rior walls and a new lay­out can ad­dress the own­ers’ lifestyle needs.</p>
    <p>The story of how home­own­ers   nd their dream home is like a ro­mance. Some are a tor­rid, love-at-  rst-sight a  air, while oth­ers are a slow burn, a multi-vol­ume se­ries where love is cul­ti­vated through the process of get­ting to know one an­other and un­cov­er­ing each other’s po­ten­tial. Well, it wasn’t love at   rst sight when   ran­cis</p>
    <p>Do­rai and Michele Min­joot saw this 22-year-old con­do­minium apart­ment unit in the East</p>
    <p>Coast  area.</p>
    <p>“The size was right, but the lay­out was just bizarre,” shares Michele. It had four be­d­rooms and   ve bath­rooms, one of which cut into the liv­ing space. “And the kitchen was this small, sad tri­an­gu­lar space, which was a let-down since we both cook and I had a mas­sive kitchen in our pre­vi­ous home,” adds    ran­cis.</p>
    <p>They had lived in a landed house for over 20 years be­fore de­cid­ing to sell it and down­size to an apart­ment that would be eas­ier to up­keep as a re­tire­ment home. The unit was on their</p>
    <p>KIV list for three months be­fore they made a bid for it. Af­ter pur­chas­ing the unit, Michele and   ran­cis de­cided to hire</p>
    <p>PIU De­sign af­ter see­ing one of the in­te­rior de­sign stu­dio’s projects in Home & Decor and meet­ing founder and di­rec­tor</p>
    <p>Mark Yong.</p>
    <p>“The chem­istry and com­fort level were just right. Mark is a can-do guy. Some of his ideas are rad­i­cal, but he man­aged to con­vince us that they’d work.</p>
    <p>And they did,” says   ran­cis.</p>
    <p>The most rad­i­cal was the com­plete al­ter­ation o   the   oor plan to stream­line zoning and shape a com­pelling spa­tial jour­ney that would re  ect the home­own­ers  per­son­al­i­ties. “Fran­cis and  ichele  s pre  ious home had a   ery   ali­nese   i  e.  hile they didn  t set out to repli­cate the style, they did want a proper place for key fur­ni­ture pieces they had   rought o  er,   shares</p>
    <p>Mark.</p>
    <p>Also, Fran­cis is a pu  lish­ing pro­fes­sional who had spent many years working for tra  el pu  li­ca­tions in his pre  ious ca­reer while</p>
    <p>Michele is a cor­po­rate com­mu­ni­ca­tions spe­cial­ist.  oth tra  el of­ten and ha  e ac­cu­mu­lated a con­sid­era  le col­lec­tion of art­works and knick-knacks.</p>
    <p>The en­trance of the new lay­out has   een pushed out, the awk­ward pow­der room in the li  ing area has   een con  erted into a store­room where</p>
    <p>Michele keeps her   icy­cles, lea  ing a spa­cious li  ing area where new arm­chairs ex­ist har­mo­niously with  in­tage teak chests-cum­side  oards. The stor­age walls   ank­ing the room are clad in ri    ed ny­a­toh wood painstak­ingly stained to match the colour of the fur­ni­ture.</p>
    <p>The for­mer din­ing room and kitchen ha  e  een merged into an open kitchen clad in a grey­toned pow­der   lue called</p>
    <p>Frost. A free-stand­ing is­land   nished in   ile­stone</p>
    <p>Cala­catta Gold takes cen­tre stage. Around it are three o  ens, two colos­sal fridges, a stain­less steel ex­haust fan and draw­ers and ca  in­ets e  uipped with pop-up mech­a­nisms from   afele and   lum that con­tain Fran­cis</p>
    <p>“kitchen toys   ap­pli­ances rang­ing from a mega food pro­ces­sor and ice cream maker to speci  c lit­tle tools like cherry pit­ters.</p>
    <p>Glass slid­ing doors with a ri    ed tex­ture sim­i­lar to the li  ing area  s stor­age walls sep­a­rate the kitchen from the rest of the home. When closed o  , it is a pri  ate working space. When opened, it is an ex­ten­sion of the li  ing room. “We cook, so the kitchen needs to   e a  le to con­tain the fumes,  ex­plains  Fran­cis.</p>
    <p>The for­mer mas­ter  ed­room is now the din­ing room, painted a shade of red that  s   etween ter­ra­cotta and carmine  old yet ap­pro­pri­ate.</p>
    <p>The study next to the din­ing room has a ri    ed glass front. In­side, work desks and chairs oc­cupy one side and   ook­shel  es the other. Com­pleted, this home tells the tale of a slow   urn lo  e story with a happy end­ing for e  ery­one.</p>
