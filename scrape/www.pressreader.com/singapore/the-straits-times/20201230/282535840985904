    <p>Since her mother’s fall eight years ago led to a hip frac­ture and an os­teo­poro­sis di­ag­no­sis, home­grown singer Kit Chan has had to do some learn­ing and ad­just­ing as her fam­ily coped with her mother’s con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>The 48-year-old tells The Straits Times: “Be­fore my mum got di­ag­nosed, I j ust didn’t think about it. Os­teo­poro­sis is some­thing we’ve all heard about, but we just think it’s part of old age and it’s in­evitable, but there are a lot of things you can do from a young age.”</p>
    <p>These in­clude weight-bear­ing ex­er­cises and ac­tiv­i­ties such as hik­ing.</p>
    <p>Chan, whose mother is 78 and fa­ther is 81, is the face of Fight The Frac­ture – a pub­lic education cam­paign about os­teo­poro­sis by biotech­nol­ogy firm Am­gen. It aims to em­power pa­tients who have suf­fered a fragility frac­ture and their care­givers to proac­tively seek pro­fes­sional help to pre­vent a sub­se­quent frac­ture.</p>
    <p>She says her par­ents were vig­i­lant in get­ting check-ups for “well pub­li­cised” con­di­tions such as heart dis­ease and di­a­betes, but ne­glected os­teo­poro­sis.</p>
    <p>Os­teo­poro­sis is a bone con­di­tion char­ac­terised by low bone mass or de­creased bone strength, which makes one more sus­cep­ti­ble to fractures.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Min­istry of Health, cases of hip fractures over the last 30 years in Sin­ga­pore have in­creased five times in women aged 50 and older, and 1½ times in men of the same age group. Stud­ies have shown that one in five peo­ple with os­teo­porotic hip fractures dies within a year.</p>
    <p>“It’s a mis­con­cep­tion that it’s not fa­tal,” says Chan, who is the sec­ond youngest of four sis­ters. Her par­ents live alone.</p>
    <p>“They’re ac­tive and they like the in­de­pen­dence. While you’re pre­pared to take care of them, you can­not treat them like chil­dren,” she says.</p>
    <p>While her mother re­cov­ered from the i njury i n about six months, she had to greatly re­duce ac­tiv­i­ties such as trav­el­ling, gar­den­ing, buy­ing gro­ceries and cook­ing for the fam­ily to avoid fall­ing.</p>
    <p>Be­fore my mum got di­ag­nosed, I just didn’t think about it. Os­teo­poro­sis is some­thing we’ve all heard about, but we just think it’s part of old age and it’s in­evitable, but there are a lot of things you can do from a young age. ’’ LO­CAL SINGER KIT CHAN (left and above, in yel­low dress in a 1978 photo) on her mum be­ing di­ag­nosed with os­teo­poro­sis after a fall which re­sulted in a hip frac­ture</p>
    <p>One day, while con­fid­ing in us, my dad broke down. It was an ‘Oh my god’ mo­ment be­cause, usu­ally, he’s the strong and silent type. My sis­ters and I had an emer­gency meet­ing and we had to get him an en­forced break be­cause he’s the type who al­ways says he’s fine, even when he’s not. ’’ KIT CHAN on the fam­ily tak­ing turns to look after her mother (above, back­ground) after her fall eight years ago</p>
    <p>Her fa­ther also qui­etly took on the role of pri­mary care­giver – con­stantly look­ing out for her to en­sure she does not fall.</p>
    <p>“My dad is not very ex­pres­sive, but we slowly ob­served that he was stressed by the role. Then one day, while con­fid­ing in us, my dad broke down. It was an ‘Oh my god’ mo­ment be­cause, usu­ally, he’s the strong and silent type. My sis­ters and I had an emer­gency meet­ing and we had to get him an en­forced break be­cause he’s the type who al­ways says he’s fine, even when he’s not.”</p>
    <p>Chan says she be­gan to take up colour­ing in books with her mother, who has al­ways had a cre­ative streak. And her fa­ther would take time out for his own Chi­nese ink paint­ing les­sons, a much needed break from care­giv­ing obli­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>She says: “You have to try and en­gage the whole fam­ily. It’s not sus­tain­able if only one or two peo­ple take on care­giv­ing du­ties.”</p>
    <p>She says the most important thing in be­ing a care­giver is to fo­cus on what the per­son be­ing looked after can do and not what she can­not do.</p>
    <p>“I showed her the video I did for this cam­paign and when I talked about this, she started go­ing, ‘Yes, yes, ex­actly.’ She was af­firm­ing that. You can fall sick or have fail­ures, but if you lose con­fi­dence, you lose half the bat­tle.”</p>
    <p>The singer says her mother’s di­ag­no­sis has also made her more aware of her own health. The singer turned 40 the year her mother had her fall.</p>
    <p>She says: “Be­fore I was 40, I ex­er­cised less than five or 10 times a year. But when I turned 40, I had friends who were quite for­ward­look­ing and we de­cided we had to start ex­er­cis­ing.</p>
    <p>“I be­gan to do things I like – pi­lates, walk­ing, swim­ming. I hate the gym, but I started do­ing a mix­ture of weight-bear­ing, bal­anc­ing and car­dio­vas­cu­lar ex­er­cises.”</p>
    <p>While Chan says her fo­cus over the years has shifted to pri­ori­tis­ing her fam­ily while in Sin­ga­pore, she is still a mu­si­cian at heart.</p>
    <p>“I’ve started to work i n the stu­dio and, next year, I’ll be re­leas­ing a few sin­gles. I was sup­posed to do a large-scale mu­si­cal this year, which has been nipped in the bud for now, of course.</p>
    <p>“For the time be­ing, I’m just grate­ful to be record­ing.”</p>
