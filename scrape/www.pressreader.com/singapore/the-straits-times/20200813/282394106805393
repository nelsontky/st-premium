    <p>WELLING­TON • New Zealand Rugby (NZR) says it wants to com­plete the do­mes­tic Su­per Rugby Aotearoa com­pe­ti­tion by play­ing the fi­nal two games this week­end but only if the govern­ment lifts Covid-19 re­stric­tions that were im­posed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment im­posed a lock­down on Auck­land, New Zealand’s largest city, and re­stric­tions on the rest of the coun­try af­ter new coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions emerged on Tues­day. The re­stric­tions will be re­viewed to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>The Otago High­landers are due to host the Welling­ton Hur­ri­canes in Dunedin on Satur­day be­fore the Auck­land Blues take on the Can­ter­bury Cru­saders at a sold-out Eden Park on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>“The pref­er­ence is to play this week,” said NZR’s head of pro­fes­sional rugby Chris Len­drum. “We want to con­clude the com­pe­ti­tion.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, the de­ci­sion would rest solely on what the govern­ment says to­mor­row. “It’s pos­si­ble we could have the game in Dunedin but not in Auck­land,” he said.</p>
    <p>“But we just have to wait un­til we get the de­ci­sion from the govern­ment on Fri­day. We have been in lock­step with them all the way through Covid and we trust their ad­vice and will fol­low it.”</p>
    <p>The Blues said on Mon­day that all 43,236 avail­able tick­ets had been sold for the last game of the do­mes­tic championsh­ip, or­gan­ised af­ter the wider Su­per Rugby com­pe­ti­tion was shut down in March.</p>
    <p>The Cru­saders wrapped up the ti­tle with a game to spare on Sun­day. Re­ports on Tues­day said the brand­new Su­per Rugby Aotearoa tro­phy needs ur­gent re­pairs af­ter it was dropped and dam­aged dur­ing the</p>
    <p>Cru­saders’ cel­e­bra­tions.</p>
    <p>A North-South match, which is be­ing looked at as an All Blacks trial game, is sched­uled for Eden Park on Aug 29.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers had hoped to base the an­nual Rugby Championsh­ip com­pe­ti­tion also in­volv­ing Aus­tralia, South Africa and Ar­gentina in New Zealand later in the year.</p>
    <p>Len­drum said it was too early to de­ter­mine whether those matches could go ahead. “We still have a sig­nif­i­cant amount of run­way avail­able be­fore any pos­si­ble All Blacks tests are played,” he added.</p>
