    <p>WHAT POM­PEO TOLD UK LAW­MAK­ERS</p>
    <p>He openly made the point that the ar­rival of the present chief had taken the WHO back­wards and that it had be­come quite po­lit­i­cal...</p>
    <p>He there­fore said that it was China who had man­aged to get oth­ers to en­sure that they voted for this par­tic­u­lar can­di­date at the time and that is why the US, he said, has de­cided to with­draw</p>
    <p>(from the WHO).</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>MEM­BER OF PAR­LIA­MENT IAIN DUNCAN SMITH, who was present at the pri­vate meet­ing in London, on Wed­nes­day con­firmed that US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo had said China swayed the WHO di­rec­tor-gen­eral elec­tion in May 2017 so Dr Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus won.</p>
    <p>LONDON • US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo told a group of Bri­tish law­mak­ers that China had “bought” the head of the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO), peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter said.</p>
    <p>At a pri­vate meet­ing in London on Tues­day, Mr Pom­peo said there was firm in­tel­li­gence to show that a deal had been done to get Dr Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus the job of WHO di­rec­tor-gen­eral – and that this had re­sulted in the deaths of Bri­tish cit­i­zens from the coro­n­avirus, the peo­ple said.</p>
    <p>Three of those present at the meet­ing, speak­ing on con­di­tion of anonymity as the talk was pri­vate, said Mr Pom­peo told them he be­lieved China had bought the WHO chief. He did not give de­tails.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo’s al­le­ga­tions mark a sig­nif­i­cant es­ca­la­tion in US crit­i­cism of the WHO and of China’s re­sponse to the pan­demic. US of­fi­cials have said the WHO al­lowed the out­break to get out of con­trol and US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has said it is too close to China.</p>
    <p>Mem­ber of Par­lia­ment Iain Duncan Smith, who was present, on Wed­nes­day con­firmed that Mr</p>
    <p>Pom­peo had said China swayed the WHO di­rec­tor-gen­eral elec­tion in May 2017 so Dr Te­dros won.</p>
    <p>“He openly made the point that the ar­rival of the present chief had taken the WHO back­wards and that it had be­come quite po­lit­i­cal,” Mr Duncan Smith said. “He there­fore said that it was China who had man­aged to get oth­ers to en­sure that they voted for this par­tic­u­lar can­di­date at the time and that is why the US, he said, has de­cided to with­draw (from the WHO).”</p>
    <p>The WHO said it strongly re­jects “any ad hominem at­tacks and un­founded al­le­ga­tions” and urged coun­tries to re­main fo­cused on tack­ling the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Asked about Mr Pom­peo’s re­marks, Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son’s of­fi­cials said the US Sec­re­tary of State did not re­peat them in his meet­ing with the Premier.</p>
    <p>“The Prime Min­is­ter be­lieves the WHO and its di­rec­tor-gen­eral are play­ing an im­por­tant role in lead­ing the global health re­sponse to the pan­demic,” a spokesman said, adding that Bri­tain is a ma­jor donor to the or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Points of con­flict be­tween the US and China have in­creased dra­mat­i­cally in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>The US Jus­tice Depart­ment on Tues­day in­dicted two Chi­nese na­tion­als over their role in what the agency called a decade-long cy­ber es­pi­onage cam­paign that tar­geted de­fence con­trac­tors, coro­n­avirus re­searchers and hun­dreds of other vic­tims world­wide.</p>
    <p>The US au­thor­i­ties said Li Xiaoyu and Dong Ji­azhi stole ter­abytes of weapons de­signs, drug in­for­ma­tion, soft­ware source code and per­sonal data from tar­gets in­clud­ing dis­si­dents and Chi­nese op­po­si­tion fig­ures. They were con­trac­tors for the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment rather than full-fledged spies, they said.</p>
    <p>US As­sis­tant At­tor­ney-Gen­eral for Na­tional Se­cu­rity John De­mers said the hack­ings showed China “is will­ing to turn a blind eye to pro­lific crim­i­nal hack­ers op­er­at­ing within its bor­ders”.</p>
    <p>“China has now taken its place, along­side Rus­sia, Iran and North Korea, in that shame­ful club of na­tions that pro­vides safe haven for cy­ber crim­i­nals in ex­change for those crim­i­nals be­ing on call for the ben­e­fit of the state,” Mr De­mers said.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese em­bassy in Wash­ing­ton re­ferred to re­cent Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry com­ments that China’s of­fi­cials “firmly op­pose and fight” such ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The in­dict­ment did not name any firms or in­di­vid­u­als, but US At­tor­ney Wil­liam Hys­lop cited “hun­dreds and hun­dreds of vic­tims in the United States and world­wide”.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials said the probe was trig­gered when the hack­ers broke into a net­work be­long­ing to the Han­ford Site, a de­com­mis­sioned US nu­clear com­plex, in 2015.</p>
    <p>Li and Dong were “one of the most pro­lific group of hack­ers we’ve in­ves­ti­gated”, FBI Spe­cial Agent Ray­mond Duda said. A July 7 in­dict­ment made pub­lic on Tues­day al­leges that they were con­trac­tors for China’s Min­istry of State Se­cu­rity (MSS), com­pa­ra­ble to the US’ Cen­tral In­tel­li­gence Agency.</p>
    <p>The MSS, pros­e­cu­tors said, supplied the hack­ers with in­for­ma­tion on crit­i­cal soft­ware vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties to pen­e­trate tar­gets and col­lect in­tel­li­gence. Tar­gets in­cluded Hong Kong pro­test­ers, the of­fice of the Dalai Lama and a Chi­nese Chris­tian non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>As early as Jan 27, as the coro­n­avirus out­break was com­ing into fo­cus, the hack­ers were try­ing to steal Covid-19 vac­cine re­search of a Mas­sachusetts biotech­nol­ogy firm, the in­dict­ment said. It is un­clear if any­thing was stolen.</p>
    <p>As Sino-US ties de­te­ri­o­rate, of­fi­cials in Wash­ing­ton have been in­creas­ingly press­ing other coun­tries to stand up against Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, Mr Pom­peo urged In­dia to fo­cus on do­mes­tic sup­ply chains and re­duce its de­pen­dence on China for telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions and med­i­cal sup­plies.</p>
    <p>In­dia had a chance to move “sup­ply chains away from China and re­duce its re­liance on Chi­nese com­pa­nies,” Mr Pom­peo said at the vir­tual US-In­dia Busi­ness Coun­cil’s In­dia Ideas Sum­mit. “In­dia is in this po­si­tion be­cause it has earned the trust of many na­tions around the world.”</p>
    <p>In­dia’s re­la­tions with China have been strained fol­low­ing a bor­der clash last month.</p>
    <p>CALL TO STAY FO­CUSED ON PAN­DEMIC</p>
    <p>WHO is not aware of any such state­ment but we strongly re­ject any ad hominem at­tacks and un­founded al­le­ga­tions... WHO urges coun­tries to re­main fo­cused on tack­ling the pan­demic that is caus­ing tragic loss of life and s’WOuRfL’ Df eHErAiLnTH­g O.</p>
