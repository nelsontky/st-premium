    <p>The Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) is ex­pand­ing the man­date of the steer­ing com­mit­tee that is over­see­ing the Swap Of­fer Rate (SOR) tran­si­tion to Sin­ga­pore Overnight Rate Av­er­age (Sora).</p>
    <p>MAS yes­ter­day said the ex­pan­sion of the man­date for this Steer­ing Com­mit­tee for SOR’s Tran­si­tion to Sora (SC-STS) is to en­able it to over­see the in­ter­est rate bench­mark tran­si­tion from the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­bank Of­fer Rate (Si­bor) to Sora.</p>
    <p>The move fol­lows a joint in­dus­try re­port pub­lished yes­ter­day, an­nounc­ing the dis­con­tin­u­a­tion of the re­main­ing Si­bor tenors in phases in the next four years.</p>
    <p>The six-month Si­bor will be dis­con­tin­ued three months af­ter the six-month SOR is dis­con­tin­ued, while the widely used one- and three-month Si­bor will be dis­con­tin­ued by the end of 2024.</p>
    <p>In July this year, the As­so­ci­a­tion of Banks in Sin­ga­pore, the Sin­ga­pore For­eign Ex­change Mar­ket Com­mit­tee and the SC-STS pub­lished rec­om­men­da­tions to dis­con­tinue Si­bor and shift to the use of Sora as the main in­ter­est rate bench­mark for Sin­ga­pore dol­lar (SGD) fi­nan­cial mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Si­bor is a key in­ter­est rate bench­mark in Sin­ga­pore that is widely used in re­tail mort­gages and cor­po­rate loans. Sora is pub­lished by MAS, and is based on the av­er­age rate of un­se­cured overnight in­ter­bank SGD trans­ac­tions bro­kered in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the re­sponse to feed­back on July’s rec­om­men­da­tions was pub­lished. The feed­back came from 74 re­spon­dents, com­pris­ing 48 banks and 26 non-bank re­spon­dents. Most agreed for the Si­bor tran­si­tion to take place af­ter the in­dus­try has sub­stan­tially com­pleted the SOR-to-Sora tran­si­tion next year, the re­port noted.</p>
    <p>On the six-month Si­bor, most agreed with the pro­posal to dis­con­tinue it when, or shortly af­ter, the six-month SOR is dis­con­tin­ued af­ter the end of next year.</p>
    <p>They cited the low use and lack of un­der­ly­ing ac­tiv­ity as key rea­sons to dis­con­tinue the six-month Si­bor be­fore the one-month and three-month Si­bor.</p>
    <p>For the one- and three-month Si­bor, most agreed with the pro­posal to dis­con­tinue them three to four years from the an­nounce­ment date. This would give time for shorter-dated cor­po­rate loan con­tracts to ma­ture, and also for longer-dated re­tail and SME (small and medium-sized en­ter­prise) mort­gage loans to exit their lock-in pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>Some had pro­posed dis­con­tin­u­ing the tenors only in five years or more, ow­ing to its use in loans for build­ings un­der con­struc­tion (BUC loans), which may have some loans be­ing dis­bursed af­ter four years, due to Covid-19 de­lays.</p>
    <p>But it was as­sessed that the po­ten­tial com­pli­ca­tions from par­tially dis­bursed Si­bor BUC loans can be man­aged.</p>
    <p>With the ex­panded man­date, the com­mit­tee will be re­named the Steer­ing Com­mit­tee for SOR & Si­bor Tran­si­tion to Sora.</p>
    <p>The SC-STS plans to is­sue mar­ket guid­ance next year on ap­proaches for the SOR to Sora tran­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Among other things, it plans to pro­vide guid­ance in the first half of next year on an ap­pro­pri­ate time­line to cease the use of Si­bor in new con­tracts.</p>
