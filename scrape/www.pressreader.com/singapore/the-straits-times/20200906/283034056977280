    <p>Pri­vate eq­uity is ven­ture cap­i­tal­ist David Gowdey’s choice of as­set class i n this eco­nomic cli­mate, where head­winds ga­lore are ex­pected for the fore­see­able fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Mr Gowdey, the man­ag­ing part­ner of ven­ture firm Jun­gle Ven­tures, be­lieves the volatile times the world is now fac­ing de­mand a longer-term ap­proach.</p>
    <p>This means savvy in­vestors should think a bit more out­side the box and look at as­set classes like pri­vate eq­uity that of­fer re­turns fur­ther down the track.</p>
    <p>Think­ing long term is all part of the job for Mr Gowdey, who was born in Amer­ica but is now an Aus­tralian na­tional. His work day in­volves deal­ing with en­trepreneur­s try­ing to build vi­able busi­nesses – an un­der­tak­ing he sees as one of life’s great­est chal­lenges but one that is highly re­ward­ing.</p>
    <p>“It is in­cred­i­bly dif­fi­cult to build some­thing from noth­ing – take an idea and make it real,” says Mr Gowdey, 49.</p>
    <p>“It takes great strength, con­vic­tion, en­ergy, pas­sion, self-mo­ti­va­tion and learn­ing agility to be a suc­cess­ful en­tre­pre­neur.”</p>
    <p>Jun­gle Ven­tures looks to back founders who have deep ex­pe­ri­ence in their sec­tor and have been able to as­sem­ble a team, Mr Gowdey adds, not­ing that it tar­gets only en­trepreneur­s with am­bi­tions to build re­gional or global cat­e­go­rylead­ing busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>The en­ter­prises it is back­ing in­clude Thai fash­ion start-up Pomelo, Sin­ga­pore-based hos­pi­tal­ity com­pany RedDoorz, and KiotViet, a cloud-based store man­age­ment firm based in Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>Mr Gowdey, who is mar­ried with three chil­dren aged be­tween eight and 13, says that while he does not in­tend to re­tire, his per­sonal fi­nan­cial plan is fo­cused on en­sur­ing that his chil­dren have the funds they will need for univer­sity stud­ies or their fu­ture en­deav­ours.</p>
    <p>Asked what money means to him, he says: “I think money in­creases your op­tions, be­cause it is an en­abler.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing it en­ables you to pro­vide a bet­ter ed­u­ca­tion or health cover for your fam­ily, or the abil­ity to travel over­seas and have ex­pe­ri­ences, but I think it also comes with the obli­ga­tion to help those who are less for­tu­nate.”</p>
    <p>Q What’s in your per­sonal port­fo­lio?</p>
    <p>A At the mo­ment I am over-in­dexed on long-term illiq­uid al­ter­na­tive in­vest­ments such as pri­vate eq­uity. I have in­vested a sig­nif­i­cant amount of my own wealth across our var­i­ous funds at Jun­gle Ven­tures.</p>
    <p>I pre­vi­ously had a large ex­po­sure to the larger pub­lic tech com­pa­nies, but I have re­duced that ex­po­sure as most were reach­ing all-time highs and I have been wary of the sus­tain­abil­ity of the pub­lic mar­ket growth given other global macro-eco­nomic trends.</p>
    <p>That said, I think the bell­wether tech com­pa­nies such as Alibaba, Ten­cent, Ama­zon, Ap­ple and Google are tremen­dously strong busi­nesses and should per­form very well over the long term.</p>
    <p>Prior to Jun­gle Ven­tures, I worked for TPG Cap­i­tal, a global pri­vate eq­uity fund, and I have con­tin­ued to in­vest across their plat­form of funds, given that I know the in­vest­ment teams well.</p>
    <p>As we get more liq­uid­ity from our longer-term in­vest­ments, we will move to­wards a more di­ver­si­fied port­fo­lio ap­proach and shift to­wards more of a wealth preser­va­tion ap­proach.</p>
    <p>My wife and I also have sev­eral in­vest­ment prop­er­ties in Australia, which will be home again some day.</p>
    <p>Q What are your im­me­di­ate in­vest­ment plans?</p>
    <p>A I am ex­pect­ing in­creased macro head­winds from the Covid-19 pan­demic for some time to come, but it is hard to pre­dict whether fur­ther govern­ment stim­u­lus will find its way to driv­ing con­sumer con­sump­tion or just in­crease as­set prices as in­vestors look for yield, so I think hav­ing solid ex­po­sure to long-term as­set classes, like ven­ture cap­i­tal or pri­vate eq­uity, is a smart po­si­tion to take.</p>
    <p>I would ex­pect near-term volatil­ity to re­main high.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, I sus­pect more cap­i­tal will be flow­ing into our space. How­ever, for in­vestors, it may be­come more chal­leng­ing to get cap­i­tal al­lo­ca­tions from the top man­agers and funds, as that has been the case in both China and the United States.</p>
    <p>Q How did you get in­ter­ested in in­vest­ing?</p>
    <p>A I started out at Ya­hoo and spent 12 years in cor­po­rate de­vel­op­ment on the merg­ers and ac­qui­si­tions team.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in­vest­ing off a bal­ance sheet is very dif­fer­ent from pure fi­nan­cial in­vest­ing.</p>
    <p>For pri­vate eq­uity in­vest­ing, it is all about the exit and get­ting your cap­i­tal back out at a mul­ti­ple, so at Jun­gle we spend a great deal of our time pick­ing the right com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing a small con­sol­i­dated port­fo­lio is an im­por­tant as­pect of our ap­proach. Pri­vate eq­uity, or more specif­i­cally ven­ture cap­i­tal in­vest­ing, is one of the hard­est as­set classes, but it can also gen­er­ate sig­nif­i­cant re­turns when you get it right.</p>
    <p>Q De­scribe your in­vest­ing strat­egy.</p>
    <p>A I typ­i­cally in­vest on a long-term hori­zon, with hold pe­ri­ods of typ­i­cally four to seven years. At Jun­gle Ven­tures, we have a con­sol­i­dated port­fo­lio ap­proach, so we in­vest more cap­i­tal into fewer com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Typ­i­cally, we in­vest in 15 com­pa­nies per fund. I work closely with the founders to grow and evolve their busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Q How are you plan­ning for re­tire­ment?</p>
    <p>A I do not plan to re­tire ever. There is no set re­tire­ment age for me in my ca­reer, so I plan on con­tin­u­ing to work with and hope­fully in­vest in smart founders for many years to come.</p>
    <p>Q Money-wise, what were your grow­ing-up years like?</p>
    <p>A We were a typ­i­cal mid­dle-class fam­ily in the United States and I grew up in North­ern Vir­ginia, the sub­urbs out­side of Wash­ing­ton, DC. My father is a patent at­tor­ney and is still prac­tis­ing law in Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>My mother, who was a nurse and passed away in 2000 from breast can­cer, grew up on a farm and she en­cour­aged us to save money, as well as to be in­de­pen­dent.</p>
    <p>I got my first job when I was 14 do­ing yard work in my neigh­bour­hood, and through­out mid­dle and high school I took on many jobs, mostly over the sum­mer break, in­clud­ing wash­ing dishes, wait­ing ta­bles, wash­ing cars and work­ing as a trainer in a health spa.</p>
    <p>Q Home is now...</p>
    <p>A I live in a landed bun­ga­low house in East Coast, which has been home for over nine years.</p>
    <p>It was built in the late 1920s and we are very for­tu­nate that it has a very large gar­den, so the chil­dren and my two dogs have plenty of space to run around and play.</p>
    <p>Q I drive...</p>
    <p>A We have a white Audi A4 con­vert­ible and a dark blue Hyundai Santa Fe sport util­ity ve­hi­cle, be­cause there are times when we need the seven seats for the chil­dren and their friends.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing a small con­sol­i­dated port­fo­lio is an im­por­tant as­pect of our ap­proach. Pri­vate eq­uity, or more specif­i­cally ven­ture cap­i­tal in­vest­ing, is one of the hard­est as­set classes, but it can also gen­er­ate sig­nif­i­cant re­turns when you get it right.</p>
