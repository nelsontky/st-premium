    <p>When the Covid-19 vac­cines are rolled out from next year for most res­i­dents, in­te­rior de­sign firm De­sign 4 Space plans to dan­gle a trip to Ja­pan to en­cour­age its staff to get the shots.</p>
    <p>Al­though the vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme here is vol­un­tary, the com­pany’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Richard Yea is en­cour­ag­ing his more than 70 em­ploy­ees to get vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>“In this trade, we have to meet home own­ers fre­quently. If our staff are vac­ci­nated, home own­ers will feel more com­fort­able en­gag­ing and in­ter­act­ing with us,” he said, adding that com­pany trips overseas were pre­vi­ously re­served only for the top per­form­ers.</p>
    <p>Med­i­cal ex­perts, hu­man re­source prac­ti­tion­ers and busi­ness as­so­ci­a­tions The Straits Times ap­proached said em­ploy­ers in Sin­ga­pore are un­likely to man­date Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion for their work­force. But many will strongly en­cour­age their staff to get the jabs.</p>
    <p>For some com­pa­nies, this means of­fer­ing in­cen­tives. These can in­clude giv­ing staff time off as well as sup­port for flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments, said Mr Ang Yuit, vice-pres­i­dent of the As­so­ci­a­tion of Small and Medium En­ter­prises.</p>
    <p>But he added: “Most com­pa­nies will un­likely be too force­ful over hav­ing their staff re­ceive vac­ci­na­tion un­less there are some spe­cific op­er­a­tional rea­sons in­ter­nally.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion chief ex­ec­u­tive Ho Meng Kit agreed, adding that the com­pany man­age­ment can lead by ex­am­ple and be the first to take the shots.</p>
    <p>The first batch of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vac­cine ar­rived in</p>
    <p>IN­CEN­TIVES UN­LIKELY TO BE NEEDED</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore on Dec 21, the first step in vac­ci­nat­ing the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The planned vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme is vol­un­tary and free for all Sin­ga­pore­ans and long-term res­i­dents here, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong had made clear on Dec 14.</p>
    <p>Med­i­cal ex­perts said there is no need for em­ploy­ers to push their staff to get the shots.</p>
    <p>“At the moment, case num­bers in Sin­ga­pore are very low so there isn’t a press­ing need to make vac­ci­na­tion com­pul­sory,” said As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Hsu Li Yang, an in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health.</p>
    <p>Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an in­fec­tious dis­eases spe­cial­ist from Mount El­iz­a­beth Novena Hospi­tal, said the risk of in­fec­tion is “ex­tremely low in pub­lic”.</p>
    <p>“It will be un­fair to force in­di­vid­u­als to trade a low risk of in­fec­tion with un­cer­tainty about the longterm side ef­fects of Covid-19 vac­cines that are yet to be fully un­der­stood,” he added.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he said em­ploy­ees should still vac­ci­nate since the risk of do­ing so is low.</p>
    <p>“Vac­ci­na­tion is putting up de­fences against the virus. It’s not just the Gov­ern­ment’s role, but ev­ery­one plays a part.</p>
    <p>“It’s only as strong as the par­tic­i­pa­tion from ev­ery­one... It al­lows us to be safe in­di­vid­u­ally and the coun­try to have herd im­mu­nity, and the coun­try to open up eco­nom­i­cally,” added Dr Leong.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore en­tered phase three of its re­open­ing yes­ter­day, with plans to loosen some re­stric­tions on work­ers re­turn­ing to of­fices.</p>
    <p>Mr Calvin Lim, gen­eral man­ager of CDPL (Tuas) Dor­mi­tory, said the com­pany will fol­low the Gov­ern­ment’s di­rec­tive on vac­ci­na­tions and let staff make their own de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>“But given that our jobs should be de­fined as front-lin­ers, we are likely to get the vac­ci­na­tion re­gard­less,” he said. The firm has around 30 staff.</p>
    <p>Peo­pleWorld­wide Con­sult­ing manag­ing direc­tor David Leong said em­ploy­ees have the right to raise con­cerns about pos­si­ble risks if they have col­leagues who choose not to be vac­ci­nated. But firms should not for­bid those who do not re­ceive the shots from en­ter­ing the of­fice.</p>
    <p>“Tech­ni­cally, the risk of ex­po­sure is low when safe dis­tanc­ing prac­tices are ob­served. It’s no dif­fer­ent from to­day’s re­al­ity,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr David Calkins, re­gional manag­ing prin­ci­pal of the Asia-Pa­cific and Mid­dle East at global ar­chi­tec­ture firm Gensler, be­lieves that the ma­jor­ity of the 54 staff at the firm’s Sin­ga­pore of­fice are open to get­ting vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>“We sus­pect that we won’t have to pro­vide much en­cour­age­ment to those of us who are in client-fac­ing roles and those who are hop­ing to be go­ing on busi­ness travel in the fu­ture to take the vac­ci­na­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>“But even as the vac­cine be­comes more widely avail­able around the globe, we are an­tic­i­pat­ing con­tin­u­ing a flex­i­ble work mode for much of next year,” he added.</p>
