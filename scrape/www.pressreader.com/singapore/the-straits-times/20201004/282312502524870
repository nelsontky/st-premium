    <p>What­ever you call it – work from ho­tel, worka­tion or “I need to leave be­fore I do some­thing I re­gret to the up­stairs guy tear­ing up his kitchen floor”, flee­ing the home of­fice is not just a good idea, but it could also just be the best thing for men­tal health. Many of us still toil away – into the sixth month or more – from our kitchen ta­bles, on so­fas and in bed­rooms.</p>
    <p>In this re­view, one ques­tion the writ­ers will ask is, does the ho­tel ex­pe­ri­ence make work bet­ter, or does work make the ho­tel ex­pe­ri­ence worse?</p>
    <p>Tourist-starved ho­tels in Sin­ga­pore are happy to ac­com­mo­date home-of­fice refugees. There are pack­ages that fit users in a co-work­ing space.</p>
    <p>Not a fan of the shar­ing econ­omy vibe? Then take a ho­tel room for a day’s stay.</p>
    <p>Not good enough? Per­haps you would be soothed by a pri­vate suite with a liv­ing area and so­fas, so you and a col­league or two might have a so­cially dis­tanced meet­ing. For a fee, some places let you bring a pet, add a part­ner, or tack on a night’s stay.</p>
    <p>Yes, you can work in a cafe. But it is more about what you can­not do – in a cafe, you can­not run a hot bath into which you have poured sweet po­tions, after which, clad in a bathrobe as thick as bear’s pelt, you eat a room-ser­vice meal.</p>
    <p>How much work you get done after that is up to you.</p>
    <p>These worka­tions were hosted by the re­spec­tive ho­tels. This is part of a weekly se­ries. For more stay­ca­tion re­views, go to str.sg/SuiteLife</p>
