    <p>LeBron James scored the win­ning bas­ket in the Los Angeles Lak­ers’ 103-101 vic­tory over city ri­vals Clip­pers on Thurs­day as the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion sea­son restarted. He is aim­ing for his team’s first ti­tle in 12 years and wants the league to be a plat­form against racism, so­cial in­jus­tice and po­lice bru­tal­ity.</p>
    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) • The Los Angeles Lak­ers are now just one vic­tory away from seal­ing the top seed­ing in the ul­tra-tough Western Con­fer­ence ahead of the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) play-offs later this month.</p>
    <p>But, af­ter a tri­umphant re­turn to the court on Thurs­day, more than four months af­ter the league was halted be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, LeBron James sought to bring the at­ten­tion back to the civil strife af­fect­ing the United States.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing af­ter the Lak­ers beat the Los Angeles Clip­pers 103-101 be­hind closed doors at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Com­plex in Dis­ney World, he said: “The game of bas­ket­ball has al­ways been big­ger than just the ball and the rim and 10 guys on the floor.</p>
    <p>“It’s an op­por­tu­nity to use this plat­form to be able to spread a lot of pos­i­tive, a lot of love, through­out the whole world. We un­der­stand what is go­ing on in so­ci­ety right now, and we’re us­ing this NBA plat­form as the play­ers, as the coaches, as or­gan­i­sa­tions to con­tinue to stand strong on that.”</p>
    <p>Asked if the league can make a dif­fer­ence amid the wide­spread an­tiracism move­ment that has been go­ing on since the death of Ge­orge Floyd by a white po­lice of­fi­cer in Min­neapo­lis on May 25, he added: “There’s been progress.</p>
    <p>“But in the past, when we’ve seen progress, we’ve let our foot of the gas a lit­tle bit. We can’t do that.</p>
    <p>“We are deal­ing with a lot of racism, a lot of so­cial in­jus­tice, a lot of po­lice bru­tal­ity... not only with black peo­ple but with peo­ple of colour, and it’s some­thing that we want to con­tinue to have peo­ple’s ears open to.”</p>
    <p>The Lak­ers-Clip­pers match-up was the sec­ond of the first two games staged since the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Utah Jazz beat the New Or</p>
    <p>FOR A WOR­THY CAUSE</p>
    <p>We are deal­ing with a lot of racism, a lot of so­cial in­jus­tice, a lot of po­lice bru­tal­ity, not only in my neigh­bour­hoods, not only with black peo­ple but with peo­ple of colour, and it’s some­thing that we want to con­tinue to have peo­ple’s ears open to.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>LEBRON JAMES, LA Lak­ers star, on the NBA be­ing a plat­form to fight racism, vi­o­lence and in­equal­ity in the US.</p>
    <p>leans Pel­i­cans 106-104 i n the opener as China’s state broad­caster CCTV main­tained its black­out of NBA games.</p>
    <p>All play­ers, coaches and staff of the four teams, along with all of­fi­cials “took a knee” and wore Black Lives Mat­ter T-shirts in sup­port of the move­ment while the na­tional an­them was played.</p>
    <p>While James will con­tinue to take a stand for so­cial jus­tice for the rest of the sea­son, it will not dis­tract him from his aim of a fourth NBA cham­pi­onship and the Lak­ers’ first since 2010.</p>
    <p>The for­ward, who fol­lowed up his own miss to make the win­ning shot with 12.8 sec­onds left, record­ing 16 points in to­tal, told ESPN: “We’re two teams... fight­ing for one com­mon goal. That’s to win a cham­pi­onship and bring it to the city of Los Angeles and fan base.”</p>
    <p>Both teams showed rust – the Clip­pers com­mit­ted 22 turnovers com­pared to 16 for the Lak­ers. The Lak­ers pre­vailed, de­spite shoot­ing 39 per cent from the floor to 43.2 per cent for the Clip­pers.</p>
    <p>Paul Ge­orge had 30 points for the Clip­pers (44-21), but he missed a three-point at­tempt at the fi­nal horn. Kawhi Leonard fin­ished with 28 points.</p>
    <p>Al­though there will no longer be any home-court ad­van­tage given that the league is play­ing out the rest of the cam­paign in Or­lando, ac­cord­ing to The Ath­letic, the Lak­ers (50-14) will be given the best ho­tel at Dis­ney World should they se­cure the top billing by beat­ing cham­pi­ons Toronto Rap­tors to­day.</p>
