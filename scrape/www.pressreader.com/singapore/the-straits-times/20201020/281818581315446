    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • A Malaysian woman who wanted to lose weight to look good at her wed­ding ended up los­ing her life in­stead when she un­der­went li­po­suc­tion at a beauty sa­lon that was not li­censed to per­form the pro­ce­dure.</p>
    <p>Malaysian po­lice have de­tained the own­ers of the beauty sa­lon in Cheras, Kuala Lumpur, and are in­ves­ti­gat­ing the mat­ter af­ter the death last Satur­day of 23-year-old Coco Siew Zhi Shing, whose hanyu pinyin name is Xiao Zhixin.</p>
    <p>Ms Siew had been prepar­ing for her wed­ding and wanted to look her best for the once-in-a-life­time event, her brother Xiao Min­gan told Sin Chew Daily.</p>
    <p>She had found the beauty sa­lon on­line while scour­ing the In­ter­net for li­po­suc­tion-re­lated treat­ments, and signed up for a RM2,500 (S$820) pro­ce­dure to ex­tract fat from her arms, ac­cord­ing to Mr Xiao.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, Ms Siew vis­ited the sa­lon for the first time, ac­com­pa­nied by a friend. She re­ceived an in­jec­tion for anaes­the­sia upon ar­rival, lo­cal me­dia re­ported.</p>
    <p>About half an hour later, she started to feel un­well, and about an hour later, her heart­beat stopped, ac­cord­ing to the re­ports.</p>
    <p>Ms Siew was rushed to hospi­tal but ef­forts to re­sus­ci­tate her failed and she was cer­ti­fied dead at around 5pm.</p>
    <p>Mr Xiao said his fam­ily mem­bers were es­pe­cially grieved that they did not ar­rive at the hospi­tal in time to see his sis­ter be­fore she died.</p>
    <p>The owner of the beauty sa­lon was not present dur­ing the pro­ce­dure and did not ap­pear at the hospi­tal until 8pm, he said.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter our re­peated ques­tion­ing, the per­son in charge of the sa­lon fi­nally re­vealed that they were not li­censed to con­duct such med­i­cal pro­ce­dures, but were li­censed only for nor­mal beauty treat­ments,” Mr Xiao told Sin Chew Daily.</p>
    <p>“The beau­ti­cian who per­formed the pro­ce­dure for my sis­ter did not have a pro­fes­sional li­cence.”</p>
    <p>The two own­ers of the beauty sa­lon, a woman and her daugh­ter, have been de­tained to as­sist in in­ves­ti­ga­tions into Ms Siew’s death, The Star news­pa­per re­ported.</p>
    <p>“We are still as­cer­tain­ing the cause of death,” Kuala Lumpur po­lice chief Sai­ful Azly Ka­marud­din told a press con­fer­ence at the Sen­tul po­lice head­quar­ters yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Li­po­suc­tion pack­ages at the sa­lon were be­ing ad­ver­tised for be­tween RM1,500 and RM3,800, and it had per­formed the pro­ce­dure for at least 10 cus­tomers, ac­cord­ing to lo­cal me­dia re­ports.</p>
    <p>Mr Xiao said his sis­ter led a healthy and fit life­style and cared greatly about her looks. She had come in first in an Asian mod­el­ling com­pe­ti­tion in 2014, he added.</p>
    <p>“I hope my sis­ter’s ex­pe­ri­ence will serve as a warn­ing to many young women,” Mr Xiao said.</p>
