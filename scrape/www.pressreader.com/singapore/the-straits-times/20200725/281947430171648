    <p>• Gold­man Sachs Group has reached a deal that would see Malaysia drop all crim­i­nal charges against the bank in ex­change for US$3.9 bil­lion (S$5.4 bil­lion) in repa­ra­tions over its role in rais­ing money for the trou­bled sov­er­eign wealth fund 1MDB.</p>
    <p>The deal in­cludes a cash set­tle­ment of US$2.5 bil­lion paid to Malaysia, the Min­istry of Fi­nance said yes­ter­day. At least an­other US$1.4 bil­lion will come from seized as­sets of 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had be­ing re­turned with the help of the US Depart­ment of Jus­tice and Gold­man Sachs, the min­istry said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The deal amount along with monies Malaysia has re­ceived from the Jus­tice Depart­ment would come to more than US$4.5 bil­lion, the min­istry added.</p>
    <p>It is un­clear how the set­tle­ment with Malaysia will af­fect dis­cus­sions be­tween Gold­man Sachs and the US Jus­tice Depart­ment. The bank is close to an agree­ment in the</p>
    <p>United States af­ter tus­sling over a po­ten­tial guilty plea, Bloomberg News re­ported ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>The deal moves Gold­man closer to end­ing its big­gest le­gal threat since the dark­est days of the 2008 fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Gold­man helped the Malaysian gov­ern­ment raise US$6.5 bil­lion for the 1MDB fund, col­lect­ing some US$600 mil­lion in fees from bond sales in 2012 and 2013, ac­cord­ing to court fil­ings. Pros­e­cu­tors al­lege that part of that money was di­verted to 1MDB of­fi­cials and their as­so­ciates.</p>
    <p>Malaysian pros­e­cu­tors brought charges against three units of the bank in 2018, then fol­lowed with ad­di­tional ac­cu­sa­tions against Gold­man’s 17 cur­rent and for­mer ex­ec­u­tives last year.</p>
    <p>The bank has con­sis­tently de­nied wrong­do­ing, say­ing that for­mer Malaysian of­fi­cials lied about how pro­ceeds from the bond sales would be used.</p>
    <p>The deal will not af­fect charges against fugi­tive fi­nancier Low Taek Jho or other par­ties, Malaysia’s Fi­nance Min­istry said.</p>
    <p>Gold­man’s for­mer South-east Asia chair­man Tim Leiss­ner has pleaded guilty to US charges in­clud­ing con­spir­acy to laun­der money and has ad­mit­ted to brib­ing of­fi­cials in Malaysia and the United Arab Emi­rates to get bond deals for the bank. And for­mer Gold­man banker Roger Ng has been ex­tra­dited from Malaysia to the US to face sim­i­lar charges.</p>
    <p>“This set­tle­ment rep­re­sents Gold­man’s ac­knowl­edge­ment of the mis­con­duct of two of its for­mer em­ploy­ees in the broader 1MDB fraud­u­lent and cor­rup­tion scheme,” said Malaysia’s Fi­nance Min­istry.</p>
    <p>The deal is a ma­jor mile­stone for Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin, a step to­wards end­ing the na­tion’s years-long ef­fort to re­cover bil­lions of dol­lars lost through the scan­dal, which played a part in the top­pling of the Najib Razak gov­ern­ment in 2018.</p>
