    <p>For the first time since it started 26 years ago, the Great Sin­ga­pore Sale (GSS) will be a largely vir­tual event, with a fo­cus on fur­ther help­ing lo­cal re­tail­ers go dig­i­tal.</p>
    <p>The an­nual sale, which will run from Sept 9 to Oct 10, will fea­ture some 800 brands this year.</p>
    <p>Touted as Sin­ga­pore’s big­gest re­tail event, the GSS usu­ally runs be­tween June and Au­gust.</p>
    <p>The move to run the sale as a vir­tual event comes two months af­ter or­gan­is­ers an­nounced in May that it was can­celling the sale due to the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­ised by the Sin­ga­pore Re­tail­ers As­so­ci­a­tion (SRA), the sale makes its dig­i­tal de­but as the eGSS: Shop.Win.Ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Re­tail­ers’ of­fer­ings will be con­sol­i­dated on SRA’s eGSS GoSpree plat­form, where shop­pers can view these items through vir­tual and aug­mented re­al­ity tools.</p>
    <p>On the plat­form, shop­pers can also play in­ter­ac­tive games to win prizes and watch live-streamed dis­cus­sions on var­i­ous brands and ser­vices, among other ac­tiv­i­ties. They can also down­load promo codes that can be used for on­line or in­store pur­chases.</p>
    <p>Af­ter brows­ing the deals on re­tail and food and bev­er­age items, at­trac­tions and ho­tels on eGSS GoSpree, shop­pers will be redi­rected to the mer­chants’ web­sites and dig­i­tal plat­forms to make their pur­chases.</p>
    <p>SRA ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Rose Tong said yes­ter­day that the na­tional sale is the only uni­fied mar­ket­ing and sales event for re­tail­ers to lever­age.</p>
    <p>“Not hav­ing the sale, they felt like some­thing was miss­ing and when we de­cided to take it on­line, we looked at how it could be dif­fer­ent,” she said, adding that deals would draw shop­pers “de­spite the gloom and doom dur­ing this time”.</p>
    <p>The eGSS will also en­cour­age re­tail­ers to seek in­no­va­tive ways to reach out to cus­tomers, she said.</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to an E-Com­merce Booster Pack­age launched by En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore in April, Ms Tong added: “We felt it was timely that eGSS takes off in Septem­ber as re­tail­ers would have had some ex­pe­ri­ence go­ing dig­i­tal and would al­ready be on some e-com­merce spa­ces.”</p>
    <p>The eGSS is or­gan­ised in col­lab­o­ra­tion with the Sin­ga­pore Fur­ni­ture In­dus­tries Coun­cil (SFIC), the Tex</p>
    <p>PROS AND CONS</p>
    <p>There are more va­ri­ety, op­por­tu­ni­ties for cus­tomi­sa­tion and less pres­sure to make a snap de­ci­sion... (but) re­turns (of on­line pur­chases) can be a pain and there is a per­sonal touch of ser­vice that e-com­merce can­not repli­cate. ’’</p>
    <p>DATA AN­A­LYST SERENE CHIA, 26, a fre­quent on­line shop­per who wel­comed the eGSS but said that phys­i­cal re­tail is still im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>tile and Fash­ion Fed­er­a­tion and – for the first time – the As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore At­trac­tions (ASA).</p>
    <p>Among these part­ner of­fer­ings are vir­tual fur­ni­ture show­rooms by the SFIC, and spe­cial back-of-house ex­pe­ri­ences and fam­ily passes from ASA mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal fash­ion and life­style brands will also be spot­lighted on on­line mar­ket­place One­or­chard.store.</p>
    <p>Mall op­er­a­tor Frasers Prop­erty Re­tail is the eGSS’ part­ner and will sup­port the sale’s var­i­ous cam­paign ini­tia­tives across 15 malls. It will also ex­tend pref­er­en­tial rates to SRA mem­bers when they join the Frasers e-Store.</p>
    <p>The eGSS is part of the $45 mil­lion nine-month Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers cam­paign that aims to boost lo­cal life­style and tourism busi­nesses af­ter half a year of slowed de­mand.</p>
    <p>Shop­pers can go to GoSpree.sg, which will go live on Tues­day. The dig­i­tal plat­form will house all the event’s cam­paign ini­tia­tives and be up­dated in the com­ing weeks.</p>
    <p>Stores and shop­pers told The Straits Times that they wel­come the event’s dig­i­tal push.</p>
    <p>Fash­ion de­signer Michelle Chan, 36, of Week­end Sun­dries, is con­sid­er­ing join­ing the event as she said it is likely to give her brand more vis­i­bil­ity. She added that cus­tomers who pre­fer to look for the brand in­store are now more open to pur­chas­ing items on­line.</p>
    <p>Data an­a­lyst Serene Chia, 26, hopes to pur­chase skin­care prod­ucts and ac­tive wear dur­ing the sale. The fre­quent on­line shop­per said: “There are more va­ri­ety, op­por­tu­ni­ties for cus­tomi­sa­tion and less pres­sure to make a snap de­ci­sion.”</p>
    <p>Phys­i­cal re­tail is still im­por­tant, she said. “Re­turns (of on­line pur­chases) can be a pain and there is a per­sonal touch of ser­vice that ecom­merce can­not repli­cate.”</p>
