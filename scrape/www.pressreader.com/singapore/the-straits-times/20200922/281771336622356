    <p>Aus­tralia’s re­cent bush fire cri­sis caused nearly A$2 bil­lion (S$1.97 bil­lion) in smoke-re­lated health costs, from pre­ma­ture deaths to emer­gency ad­mis­sions for asthma, re­searchers said, a record for any fire sea­son in the coun­try and a pointer to fu­ture health costs as the planet heats up.</p>
    <p>The blazes burnt about eight mil­lion ha of forests and farm­land in an unusu­ally long fire sea­son last­ing more than six months from Au­gust last year to March this year, blan­ket­ing ma­jor cities – in­clud­ing Syd­ney, Mel­bourne and Canberra – in haz­ardous smoke for weeks and af­fect­ing mil­lions of peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Pic­tures of fa­mous Syd­ney tourist spots – from Bondi Beach to the Harbour Bridge – all but blanked out by smoke shocked the na­tion and the world.</p>
    <p>Just to the south, the fed­eral cap­i­tal Canberra recorded some of the worst air qual­ity in the world. In early Jan­uary, its Air Qual­ity In­dex peaked at 5,185 – more than 25 times above haz­ardous lev­els.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers said the health costs and risk to lives at­trib­ut­able to bush fire smoke have the po­ten­tial to in­crease dra­mat­i­cally as the fre­quency and in­ten­sity of wild­fires in­crease with a hot­ter cli­mate.</p>
    <p>“The global trend of longer fire sea­sons with more ex­treme fire weather is lead­ing to fires that are unusu­ally fre­quent, se­vere and, in some cases, eco­nom­i­cally de­struc­tive,” said the au­thors of the study pub­lished yes­ter­day in the jour­nal Na­ture Sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>They found that the health ef­fects of smoke pol­lu­tion are not al­ways in­cluded in cost as­sess­ments of bush fire im­pacts, which gen­er­ally fo­cus more on the costs of fir­ere­lated in­juries, hous­ing and in­fra­struc­ture losses and fight­ing the blazes.</p>
    <p>To get a bet­ter idea of the di­rect health costs, they looked at the num­ber of cases re­ferred to hospi­tal emer­gency de­part­ments for asthma, ad­mis­sions to hospi­tal for car­dio-re­s­pi­ra­tory dis­or­ders and deaths from all causes linked to bush fire smoke in pop­u­lated south­ern re­gions of Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>They com­pared the to­tal eco­nomic costs as­so­ci­ated with deaths and hospi­tal ad­mis­sions for each fire sea­son (Oc­to­ber through March) for a 20-year pe­riod from Oct 1, 2000.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers found that the smoke-re­lated health costs of the 2019-2020 fire sea­son to­talled a record A$1.95 bil­lion – in­volv­ing 429 smoke-re­lated pre­ma­ture deaths, 3,230 hospi­tal ad­mis­sions for car­dio­vas­cu­lar and re­s­pi­ra­tory dis­or­ders and 1,523 emer­gency cases for asthma.</p>
    <p>The to­tal cost was well above the next high­est es­ti­mate of A$566 mil­lion in 2002-2003 and more than nine times the me­dian an­nual bush fire as­so­ci­ated costs of A$211 mil­lion for the pre­vi­ous 19 years, they con­cluded.</p>
    <p>The au­thors noted that they did not ac­count for likely on­go­ing costs of med­i­ca­tion, am­bu­lance call­outs, re­duced pro­duc­tiv­ity or men­tal health bur­dens, which are im­por­tant con­trib­u­tors to the eco­nomic im­pacts of fire disasters.</p>
    <p>“For these rea­sons, the health and eco­nomic as­sess­ments we present are likely to un­der­es­ti­mate the true bur­den,” they said.</p>
    <p>And the long-term costs of bush fire smoke ex­po­sure are un­known – be it in Aus­tralia or else­where.</p>
    <p>Bush fire smoke con­tains ir­ri­tants that af­fect the eyes and the lungs, caus­ing coughs, and can ex­ac­er­bate heart and lung con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Tiny par­ti­cles in the smoke less than 2.5 mi­crons in di­am­e­ter can lodge deep in­side the lungs and get into the blood­stream.</p>
    <p>Health ex­perts say that the longterm ex­po­sure to high lev­els of PM2.5 par­tic­u­late mat­ter is still un­clear, al­though re­search sug­gests it could in­crease cases of heart dis­ease and stroke.</p>
    <p>Still, the find­ings are a use­ful guide for the au­thor­i­ties in Aus­tralia, the United States and In­done­sia, as well as other places in­creas­ingly af­fected by larger and more in­tense fires.</p>
