    <p>LON­DON • As na­tion af­ter na­tion rushed this week to close their bor­ders with Bri­tain, the moves brought back mem­o­ries of the way the world re­acted af­ter the coro­n­avirus first emerged broadly in the spring.</p>
    <p>Most of those ini­tial travel pro­hi­bi­tions came too late, put in place af­ter the virus had al­ready seeded it­self in com­mu­ni­ties far and wide. This time, with coun­tries try­ing to stop the spread of a new, pos­si­bly more con­ta­gious coro­n­avirus vari­ant iden­ti­fied by Bri­tain, it may also be too late.</p>
    <p>It is not known how widely the vari­ant is al­ready cir­cu­lat­ing, ex­perts say, and the bans threaten to cause more eco­nomic and emo­tional hard­ship as the toll wrought by the virus con­tin­ues to grow.</p>
    <p>Bel­gium, for ex­am­ple, recorded four cases of the mu­tant coro­n­avirus vari­ant sweep­ing Bri­tain at the start of this month, health of­fi­cials said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The four cases were un­cov­ered in the coun­try’s north­ern Flem­ish re­gions that bor­der the Nether­lands, said Mr Jan Ey­ck­mans, spokesman for Bel­gium’s Health Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the na­tional virus cri­sis cen­tre said the fig­ure was con­ser­va­tive and that other in­fec­tions by the strain could have gone un­de­tected as Bel­gium screens for new mu­ta­tions far less than Bri­tain does.</p>
    <p>“It is id­i­otic” was the blunt as­sess­ment of Dr Peter Krem­sner, di­rec­tor of Tub­in­gen Univer­sity Hospi­tal in Ger­many. “If this mu­tant was only on the is­land, only then does it make sense to close the bor­ders to Eng­land, Scot­land and Wales. But if it has spread, then we have to com­bat the new mu­tant ev­ery­where.”</p>
    <p>He noted that the sci­en­tific un­der­stand­ing of the mu­ta­tion was lim­ited and its dan­gers un­clear, and de­scribed as “naive” the no­tion that the vari­ant was not al­ready spread­ing widely out­side Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Also, Bri­tain has some of the most so­phis­ti­cated ge­nomic sur­veil­lance ef­forts in the world, which al­lowed sci­en­tists there to dis­cover the vari­ant when it might have gone un­no­ticed else­where, ex­perts said.</p>
    <p>South Korea and the Philip­pines, mean­while, have moved to tem­po­rar­ily sus­pend UK flights, while Ja­pan is strength­en­ing en­try reg­u­la­tions for peo­ple trav­el­ling from Bri­tain – join­ing a long list of coun­tries that have turned wary of trav­ellers from the UK.</p>
    <p>Dr Hans Kluge, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s re­gional di­rec­tor for Europe, said mem­ber states would try to come up with a co­her­ent ap­proach to any threat posed by the vari­ant.</p>
    <p>At the mo­ment, he wrote on Twit­ter, “lim­it­ing travel to con­tain spread is pru­dent un­til we have bet­ter in­for­ma­tion”. But he added, “no one is safe un­til ev­ery­one is safe”.</p>
    <p>With grow­ing calls for the United States to join the dozens of na­tions im­pos­ing bans on travel from Bri­tain, Dr An­thony Fauci, Amer­ica’s top in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­pert, urged cau­tion, say­ing there was a good chance the vari­ant was al­ready there.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think that that kind of a dra­co­nian ap­proach is nec­es­sary,” he said on PBS New­sHour on Mon­day night. “I think we should se­ri­ously con­sider the pos­si­bil­ity of re­quir­ing test­ing of peo­ple be­fore they come from the UK here.”</p>
    <p>In the ab­sence of fed­eral ac­tion, other state and lo­cal lead­ers called for sim­i­lar mea­sures be­fore the peak hol­i­day travel days.</p>
    <p>Many coun­tries al­ready re­quire a neg­a­tive coro­n­avirus test for en­try, but cut­ting off all travel between na­tions is a more fraught propo­si­tion.</p>
