    <p>Fi­nally, Sin­ga­pore is go­ing to have what has been de­scribed as the big­gest non-real es­tate in­vest­ment trust ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO) in years with the pro­posed main­board list­ing of home-grown Nanofilm Tech­nolo­gies (Nanofilm IPO shares priced at $2.59; Te­masek to take sub­stan­tial stake, Oct 24).</p>
    <p>Nanofilm is a com­mer­cial spin-off from Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity, and is a val­i­da­tion of aca­demic re­search and com­mer­cial ap­pli­ca­tion lead­ing to fruit­ful en­ter­prise.</p>
    <p>Nanofilm is pri­mar­ily a coat­ing so­lu­tions provider in the ad­vanced ma­te­rial space. The Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment has been in­vest­ing heav­ily to sup­port ad­vanced ma­te­rial re­search and de­vel­op­ment (R&D) as a crit­i­cal en­abling tech­nol­ogy. Based on Nanofilm’s IPO prospec­tus, the com­pany has en­joyed high growth with im­pres­sive net mar­gin.</p>
    <p>Nanofilm is rais­ing $470 mil­lion by of­fer­ing 181.5 mil­lion shares priced at $2.59 apiece, valu­ing it at $1.7 bil­lion. It has se­cured 104.3 mil­lion shares sub­scrip­tion from 13 cor­ner­stone in­vestors, in­clud­ing Te­masek, and the re­main­ing will be sold through in­ter­na­tional place­ment and pub­lic of­fer­ing in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>How­ever, only about $191 mil­lion or 41 per cent of the net pro­ceeds will go to the com­pany. In other words, ap­prox­i­mately $279 mil­lion will go to the founders and pro­mot­ers of the com­pany. The IPO pro­ceeds will be used mainly for ac­quir­ing new ma­chin­ery and fa­cil­i­ties, and spend­ing on R&D, and en­gi­neer­ing.</p>
    <p>Given its en­vi­able sales growth and prof­itabil­ity track record in a high-growth sec­tor for years to come, Nanofilm should be spend­ing more on merg­ers and ac­qui­si­tions, ex­pand­ing mar­kets and cus­tomer bases, and more R&D to stay ahead of the bru­tal com­pe­ti­tion in this space.</p>
    <p>Thus, rais­ing sub­stan­tial funds should be its prerog­a­tive.</p>
    <p>If there is such high de­mand for the shares, why does the com­pany not in­crease new share is­sue in­stead of the founders selling their shares? The founders can al­ways sell their shares post-IPO in the se­condary mar­ket af­ter the mora­to­rium is lifted. This is also proof of strong con­fi­dence in the com­pany they founded, and will align their in­ter­ests with that of IPO in­vestors.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing more new shares would al­low more par­tic­i­pa­tion in Nanofilm’s suc­cess story by in­ter­na­tional and Sin­ga­pore in­vestors.</p>
    <p>With a lim­ited pool of only 3.9 mil­lion shares for pub­lic of­fer, Sin­ga­pore in­vestors would be hard-pressed to get a piece of this stock, un­less they are will­ing to pay a higher price in the se­condary mar­ket.</p>
