    <p>On Nov 23, the body of Madam Lily Loh, who was in her 80s, was found in her Am­ber Road con­do­minium unit.</p>
    <p>Madam Loh, who was last seen al­most two years ago, had died alone, and her re­mains were found along with those of her pet dog.</p>
    <p>It is not as if the warn­ing signs were not there: The Straits Times re­ported how she was liv­ing by her­self, had not been seen by neigh­bours for months and, most tellingly, her let­ters were pil­ing up out­side her door.</p>
    <p>Hor­ri­fy­ingly, a neigh­bour also said that there was a “weird smell” in the com­mon cor­ri­dor, which went away “af­ter a few weeks”.</p>
    <p>And yet, no one seemed to care enough to knock on her door to check on her. This tragic episode raises a num­ber of trou­bling ques­tions.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a re­port in The New Pa­per, the condo’s man­age­ment cor­po­ra­tion said that when res­i­dents alerted it to Madam</p>
    <p>Loh’s men­tal and phys­i­cal con­di­tion in Au­gust 2018, it started in­volv­ing so­cial ser­vices and the po­lice to see if as­sis­tance was needed.</p>
    <p>In fact, it had asked the po­lice to check on her two years ago, but she be­came ag­i­tated when the po­lice vis­ited her.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, it is puz­zling why the condo man­age­ment con­tin­ued to take such a hands-off ap­proach.</p>
    <p>A res­i­dent also told on­line news site Moth­er­ship that the man­age­ment had pasted a court no­tice on Madam Loh’s door. Surely the piled-up let­ters must have been no­ticed then?</p>
    <p>What about the neigh­bours? The res­i­dent who smelled some­thing weird ap­par­ently made no at­tempt to con­nect with Madam Loh. The dog must have barked out of sheer hunger – is it pos­si­ble no one heard it?</p>
    <p>Did Madam Loh not have a sin­gle con­tact in the condo de­vel­op­ment, and no one had her num­ber? It would ap­pear that she did not have a sin­gle friend or fam­ily mem­ber who could have checked on her.</p>
    <p>It is telling that Madam Loh’s body was dis­cov­ered only af­ter a res­i­dent sought help by ap­proach­ing Mount­bat­ten MP Lim Biow Chuan, who then for­warded the in­for­ma­tion to the po­lice.</p>
    <p>What the in­ci­dent shows is the current state of neigh­bourli­ness in the coun­try. In crowded Sin­ga­pore, it is un­der­stand­able to re­spect one an­other’s per­sonal space. It can also be tir­ing to be in­volved in the lives of peo­ple around us, es­pe­cially as this can lead to un­nec­es­sary drama – af­ter all, no one wants to be la­belled a kay­poh (Hokkien for “busy­body”).</p>
    <p>Yet, even in our busy lives and in re­spect­ing other peo­ple’s pri­vacy, there should be room for kind­ness. Sweep­ing away con­cern for our fel­low man with ex­cuses such as “it’s not our busi­ness” or “let’s re­spect their pri­vacy” is not be­ing re­spect­ful; it is be­ing un­car­ing.</p>
    <p>Too many dy­ing alone</p>
    <p>This is not the first such tragedy to have hap­pened to our se­niors. But even one death un­der such cir­cum­stances is one too many. In 2017, The Straits Times re­ported that at least 100 bod­ies a year go un­claimed in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>We are a grey­ing na­tion. In 1970, 3.4 per cent of our pop­u­la­tion were 65 years and above. Last year, it was 14.4 per cent. It is es­ti­mated that by 2035, se­niors aged 65 and above will grow to 32 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor An­gelique Chan, ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of the Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School’s Cen­tre for Age­ing Re­search and Ed­u­ca­tion, told CNA that the num­ber of peo­ple dy­ing alone may be­gin to rise just be­cause “the sheer num­ber of peo­ple liv­ing alone is in­creas­ing”.</p>
    <p>She pointed out that the sense of com­mu­nity in Sin­ga­pore has de­clined be­cause of the liv­ing en­vi­ron­ment and ur­ban de­sign.</p>
    <p>“We ba­si­cally live be­hind closed doors most of the time. So it’s very hard to get to know your neigh­bours,” she said. “We don’t know each other, we don’t talk to each other.”</p>
    <p>The Depart­ment of Statis­tics es­ti­mates that 83,000 elderly per­sons will be liv­ing alone by 2030, com­pared with the 47,000 se­niors aged 65 and above in 2016.</p>
    <p>If the state of neigh­bourli­ness re­mains un­changed, we are set­ting our­selves up for more such in­ci­dents of our se­niors dy­ing alone.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem is com­pounded by the sense of iso­la­tion. A Lon­gi­tu­di­nal Age­ing Study in 2012 by the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine found that se­niors liv­ing alone and feel­ing iso­lated were twice as likely as their peers to de­velop de­pres­sive symp­toms as a re­sult of lone­li­ness.</p>
    <p>Psy­chi­a­trists say in­ter­ac­tion and emo­tional sup­port can pre­vent vul­ner­a­ble se­niors from suf­fer­ing from de­pres­sion. Im­me­di­ate fam­ily mem­bers are ex­pected to be re­spon­si­ble for the se­niors’ phys­i­cal and emo­tional needs, but many of them may not have loved ones liv­ing nearby. Some may even be es­tranged from their rel­a­tives.</p>
    <p>More than just neigh­bours</p>
    <p>The re­al­ity is that im­me­di­ate neigh­bours are the most nat­u­ral sup­port group. This is en­cap­su­lated in the Chi­nese saying yuan qin bu ru jin lin, which trans­lates into “dis­tant rel­a­tives are not as good as im­me­di­ate neigh­bours”.</p>
    <p>At the Sin­ga­pore Kind­ness Move­ment, we have al­ways pro­moted the idea of “neigh­bours by chance, friends by choice”.</p>
    <p>Here are three sim­ple things we can do to pre­vent the tragedy of dy­ing alone from hap­pen­ing to our neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>1 In­ten­tion­ally reach out to our se­nior neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>This is just a mat­ter of find­ing out who our im­me­di­ate neigh­bours are and who lives in our block. Take the trou­ble to look out for se­niors, es­pe­cially those who live alone, and show them ges­tures of care and con­cern. Give them a help­ing hand with their gro­ceries, chat with them, ex­change con­tact num­bers, and in­vite them to call you if they need help.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>Check on them on a reg­u­lar ba­sis.</p>
    <p>Of­fer to run er­rands like buying gro­ceries for them. Drop by and chat with them. You never know what you might learn from their ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>Madam Rasamal Na­dayson, af­fec­tion­ately known as “Aun­tie Rose”, is a good ex­am­ple of a car­ing se­nior. The 82-year-old lives alone at her Dover Road flat and takes pride in be­ing a friend to her elderly neigh­bours. She spends time chat­ting with them and re­mind­ing them to eat reg­u­lar meals and watch their diet when it comes to su­gar and salt.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>Give them a hand­made card to show them you care.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, a group of youth started an ini­tia­tive called Hey, You Got Mail, with the aim of com­bat­ing so­cial iso­la­tion in Sin­ga­pore by de­liv­er­ing per­son­alised, hand­writ­ten cards to se­niors in nurs­ing homes.</p>
    <p>So how about as a December hol­i­day pro­ject, we get our chil­dren to de­sign and de­liver cards to our neigh­bours? It is also a good way to teach the young to re­spect and care for the elderly. Se­niors, es­pe­cially those with­out grand­chil­dren or who do not see them of­ten, may ap­pre­ci­ate the laugh­ter and in­no­cence of chil­dren vis­it­ing them. It would be a good re­minder to the se­niors that they are not alone.</p>
    <p>It is im­por­tant to reach out to the dis­con­nected among us be­cause although they can choose to live alone, they need not die alone.</p>
    <p>If we start look­ing out for one an­other, and ex­tend the warmth of friend­ship, es­pe­cially to our elderly neigh­bours, we can help en­sure no one walks the last lap of life alone and be for­got­ten.</p>
    <p>Let’s be friends by choice though we are neigh­bours by chance.</p>
