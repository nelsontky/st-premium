    <p>Though it has been re­ported that ba­bies might be born with Covid-19 an­ti­bod­ies if their moth­ers were in­fected with the virus dur­ing preg­nancy, it re­mains un­clear if this would mean the baby is im­mune to the coro­n­avirus or how long the im­mu­nity would last.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, Mrs Celine Ng-Chan, 31, gave birth to her sec­ond child and was told by her son’s pae­di­a­tri­cian that he has an­ti­bod­ies against the virus.</p>
    <p>Mrs Ng-Chan, a tu­ition teacher, is one of the few women in Sin­ga­pore who were in­fected with Covid-19 dur­ing their preg­nancy to have given birth here so far.</p>
    <p>In such cases, it is still un­clear if the an­ti­bod­ies were passed from the mother or the baby de­vel­oped them for him­self or her­self.</p>
    <p>In a pa­per pub­lished in Oc­to­ber by the jour­nal Emerg­ing In­fec­tious Dis­eases, of the 11 in­fants who were born to women with Covid-19 in Wuhan, China, all had de­tectable lev­els of IgG an­ti­bod­ies at birth, while five had de­tectable IgM an­ti­bod­ies.</p>
    <p>IgM is the ini­tial an­ti­body that is pro­duced in re­sponse to an in­fec­tion. How­ever, it is usu­ally not trans­ferred from mother to foe­tus through the pla­centa due to its large size.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, smaller IgG an­ti­bod­ies can be trans­ferred pas­sively from mother to foe­tus through the pla­centa, the pa­per noted. The du­ra­tion of im­mu­nity from the ma­ter­nal IgG an­ti­bod­ies is un­clear.</p>
    <p>Checks with the KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal (KKH) also had sim­i­lar re­sults.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Tan Hak Koon, KKH’s chair­man at the di­vi­sion of ob­stet­rics and gy­nae­col­ogy, said there is ev­i­dence of an­ti­bod­ies among in­fants born to moth­ers with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, it is still un­known whether the pres­ence of th­ese an­ti­bod­ies in a new­born baby con­fers a de­gree of pro­tec­tion against Covid-19 in­fec­tion, much less the du­ra­tion of pro­tec­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, both the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal (NUH) and KKH are part of a larger on­go­ing study in­volv­ing sev­eral public hos­pi­tals in Sin­ga­pore in­ves­ti­gat­ing how Covid-19 may po­ten­tially im­pact the well-be­ing and health of preg­nant women and their ba­bies.</p>
    <p>An NUH spokesman said: “We hope that find­ings from the study can help in­form clin­i­cal guid­ance for the care of af­fected preg­nant women and their in­fants, and help safe­guard their health and well-be­ing.”</p>
    <p>Mrs Ng-Chan and her son are also part of this study. She said: “I’m one of the few mums in Sin­ga­pore to get Covid-19 dur­ing preg­nancy.</p>
    <p>“I agreed to be part of the study as I be­lieve it is very im­por­tant, so that we can find out more and fight the virus bet­ter.”</p>
