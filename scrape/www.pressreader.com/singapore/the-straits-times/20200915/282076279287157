    <p>Ac­tor-singer Mo­hamad Aliff Aziz is fac­ing a pos­si­ble jail term after be­ing found to be un­suit­able for a manda­tory treat­ment or­der (MTO).</p>
    <p>Of­fend­ers given an MTO have to un­dergo treat­ment to ad­dress their men­tal con­di­tions in lieu of im­pris­on­ment. It was not men­tioned in court yes­ter­day why MTO was not rec­om­mended for him.</p>
    <p>The 29-year-old Sin­ga­porean pleaded guilty last month to one count of theft and an un­re­lated charge of be­hav­ing in a dis­or­derly man­ner in pub­lic.</p>
    <p>This was not his first brush with the law.</p>
    <p>In 2014, he was fined $2,000 for steal­ing two mo­bile phones.</p>
    <p>In the current case, the court heard that Aliff met Indonesian ac­tress Raja Yu­nika Perd­hana Putri, 32, in her room at the Stu­dio M ho­tel near Have­lock Road at around mid­night on June 7 last year.</p>
    <p>He was there to dis­cuss how she could help fur­ther his singing ca­reer in In­done­sia. At around 1am, Ms Raja Yu­nika went to the sec­ond storey of her room to rest, leav­ing her hand­bag near Aliff.</p>
    <p>Be­fore leav­ing the room, he opened the hand­bag to steal $300 and one mil­lion ru­piah (S$94) in cash.</p>
    <p>She woke up about two hours later and phoned Aliff after notic­ing that her money was miss­ing. He de­nied steal­ing the cash and she lodged a po­lice re­port later that day.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tor Sarah Siaw had said that Aliff later ad­mit­ted he had stolen the cash as “he was in need of money”.</p>
    <p>He then used the cash for food and trans­porta­tion. He has since made full resti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>In an un­re­lated case, Aliff was found to be in­tox­i­cated un­der the link bridge of Orchard Tow­ers shop­ping cen­tre at around 5.30am on Nov 10 last year.</p>
    <p>A po­lice of­fi­cer who was in the vicin­ity saw that he was shout­ing loudly and ges­tic­u­lat­ing at some­one.</p>
    <p>Sergeant Theodore Lee, 24, told Aliff to calm down and the artiste com­plied be­fore walk­ing away, only to com­mit sim­i­lar acts about an hour later.</p>
    <p>This time, Aliff walked to­wards a nearby taxi and kicked its bumper. No dam­age was caused.</p>
    <p>He was ar­rested after he got into a scuf­fle with an ac­quain­tance, the court heard.</p>
    <p>Aliff rose to fame in 2007 after win­ning Malay chan­nel Suria’s ver­sion of Sin­ga­pore Idol, called Anugerah. He was in the spot­light last year for his divorce from</p>
    <p>Malaysian singer Bella Astil­lah and pur­ported ro­man­tic scan­dals in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple, who wed in 2016 and split up in May last year, have re­port­edly rec­on­ciled.</p>
    <p>Aliff will be sen­tenced to­day.</p>
