    <p>LON­DON • Stella Ten­nant, the unim­peach­ably aris­to­cratic model and in­spi­ra­tion to fash­ion de­sign­ers like Karl Lager­feld and Gianni Ver­sace, died sud­denly on Tues­day, five days af­ter her 50th birth­day.</p>
    <p>Her death was an­nounced in a state­ment by her fam­ily. The cause of death was not given. Po­lice re­ports noted no sus­pi­cious cir­cum­stances sur­round­ing her death, ac­cord­ing to the BBC.</p>
    <p>The grand­daugh­ter of Mr An­drew Cavendish, the 11th Duke of Devon­shire, and Ms Deb­o­rah Cavendish, Duchess of Devon­shire and the youngest of the Mit­ford sis­ters, Ten­nant was di­rectly de­scended from Bess of Hard­wick, builder of the op­u­lent El­iz­a­bethan manor Hard­wick Hall and once re­puted to be the rich­est woman in Eng­land.</p>
    <p>Ten­nant wore her rar­efied her­itage lightly through­out her three­decade run in fash­ion, dur­ing which she walked the run­ways for most ma­jor fash­ion de­sign­ers; was fea­tured in ad­ver­tis­ing cam­paigns for nearly ev­ery im­por­tant la­bel; ap­peared on scores of mag­a­zine cov­ers; and worked with a full ros­ter of the world’s elite pho­tog­ra­phers, ed­i­tors, make-up artists and stylists.</p>
    <p>Along with Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss, Ten­nant was cho­sen to rep­re­sent English fash­ion at the clos­ing cer­e­mony of the 2012 Olympics.</p>
    <p>In the late 1990s, Lager­feld signed her to an exclusive con­tract as the face of Chanel. In do­ing so, Lager­feld noted the very English Ten­nant’s like­ness to the in­com­pa­ra­bly Gal­lic founder of the fa­bled house.</p>
    <p>Ten­nant’s off­hand ease with du­al­ity – par­tic­u­larly of class and gen­der – kept her in de­mand through­out the decades with fash­ion de­sign­ers like Valentino Gar­a­vani, Al­ber El­baz, Gior­gio Ar­mani, Marc Jacobs and Ver­sace, whose fam­ily, in a state­ment on Tues­day, called her the late de­signer’s “muse”.</p>
    <p>If they ad­mired her beauty, de­sign­ers also banked on her abil­ity to em­body mul­ti­ple fash­ion archetypes.</p>
    <p>“She was equally beau­ti­ful in a tuxedo or a chif­fon dress,” said El­baz, who cast Ten­nant to star in his first ad­ver­tis­ing cam­paign for Yves Saint Lau­rent when he as­sumed de­sign re­spon­si­bil­i­ties there in 1998 (and soon af­ter Ten­nant gave birth to her first child).</p>
    <p>“She was not re­ally a model,” he added. “She was a woman, a mother, English, aris­to­cratic but with a golden heart.”</p>
    <p>Ten­nant is sur­vived by her hus­band David Las­net, a photograph­er and os­teopath from whom she had sep­a­rated in Au­gust af­ter 21 years of mar­riage, and four chil­dren – Iris, Jas­mine, Ce­cily and Mar­cel.</p>
