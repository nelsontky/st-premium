    <p>When even they are very suc­cess­ful in their ca­reers, mil­len­nial women tend to de­fer to their hus­bands when it comes to money mat­ters.</p>
    <p>A re­cent study by Swiss bank­ing group UBS found that even the most ed­u­cated and high-achiev­ing mil­len­nial women were not as in­volved as their hus­bands in longterm fi­nan­cial de­ci­sion-mak­ing.</p>
    <p>In fact, mil­len­nial women – part of a gen­er­a­tion thought to have pushed for open-mind­ed­ness about gen­der roles – ex­hib­ited less fi­nan­cial in­de­pen­dence than boomer women did.</p>
    <p>Among mil­len­nial women liv­ing with male part­ners, 54 per cent said they de­ferred to the men for long-term fi­nan­cial plan­ning rather than shar­ing that re­spon­si­bil­ity or tak­ing the lead them­selves, com­pared with 39 per cent of boomer women, ac­cord­ing to the study, which sur­veyed 1,320 women with at least US$250,000 (S$337,000) in in­vestable as­sets.</p>
    <p>The pri­mary rea­son those women de­ferred was a be­lief that their hus­bands knew more, the study found. There have been wor­ry­ing signs of a lack of progress to­wards gen­der equal­ity at all in­come lev­els.</p>
    <p>An­other study by con­sult­ing firm McKin­sey found that a third of moth­ers had con­sid­ered leav­ing the work­force or down­shift­ing their ca­reers dur­ing the pan­demic, with a ma­jor­ity of those cit­ing child­care chal­lenges as a pri­mary rea­son.</p>
    <p>The UBS study also found that fewer mil­len­nial women than boomer women saw fi­nan­cial par­tic­i­pa­tion as nec­es­sary for equal­ity, with 76 per cent of mil­len­ni­als (aged 24 to 39) say­ing it was es­sen­tial, com­pared with 89 per cent of boomers (aged 56 to 74).</p>
    <p>Ms Erin Lowry, a per­sonal fi­nance ad­viser and au­thor of Broke Mil­len­nial, said: “I know a lot of mil­len­nial women who are fem­i­nists, lib­er­ated and what­ever, who let their hus­bands han­dle all the fi­nances. It’s very much still an archetype in het­ero­sex­ual re­la­tion­ships.”</p>
    <p>Mil­len­nial women – part of a gen­er­a­tion thought to have pushed for open-mind­ed­ness about gen­der roles – ex­hib­ited less fi­nan­cial in­de­pen­dence than boomer women did.</p>
