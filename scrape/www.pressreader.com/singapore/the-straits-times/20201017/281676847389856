    <p>The pan­demic may have wrapped its ten­ta­cles around Hong Kong’s tourism in­dus­try, but the sec­tor is ex­pected to get its bounce back once travel bub­bles are in place, a top tourism of­fi­cial has said.</p>
    <p>Mr Dane Cheng, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB), is op­ti­mistic that the tourism in­dus­try will re­cover quickly due to pent-up de­mand and the fact that the city is not un­der a full lock­down.</p>
    <p>“The No. 1 is­sue is that you want to make sure that the Covid sit­u­a­tion is well-con­tained be­fore you can open up (un­der a travel bub­ble).”</p>
    <p>“When you say open up, it is not just about your vis­i­tors com­ing in, but it is also about your own res­i­dents trav­el­ling out, and it is not just about leisure travel, it is also about busi­ness travel,” said Mr Cheng, who added that peo­ple are pru­dent and want to know that their gov­ern­ments can con­tain the sit­u­a­tion with trav­ellers ar­riv­ing.</p>
    <p>No one in Asia has achieved this yet, and to do so, the gov­ern­ment pol­icy on this will be based on sci­ence and med­i­cal ev­i­dence, the 57-year-old said in an in­ter­view with The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong could be the first to try out a travel bub­ble as both cities said on Thurs­day they had agreed on a pre­lim­i­nary deal in which some of the key fea­tures in­clude hav­ing des­ig­nated flights between the two cities with­out tran­sit pas­sen­gers and do­ing away with manda­tory quar­an­tine on both sides if vis­i­tors test neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>With bor­ders mostly shut and air travel down, Mr Cheng and his team have ag­o­nised over how HKTB can stim­u­late the econ­omy, which has slid into a re­ces­sion. Hong Kong’s econ­omy is pro­jected to shrink by between 6 per cent and 8 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>Tourism-re­lated in­dus­tries in the city ac­counted for 4.5 per cent of the econ­omy in 2018, a fig­ure that Mr Cheng said has been wiped out this year.</p>
    <p>In mid-June, af­ter a sec­ond wave of the pan­demic, HKTB rolled out for the first time a do­mes­tic tour cam­paign for lo­cals to ex­plore and re­dis­cover the city. But the pro­gramme was sus­pended when a third wave of in­fec­tions started in July. The city has only re­cently emerged from the third wave.</p>
    <p>Also on pause is HKTB’s plan to en­cour­age cross-in­dus­try and cross-trade spend­ing by let­ting 10,000 peo­ple claim free lo­cal tours if they spend HK$800 (S$140) in one re­ceipt on re­tail or din­ing.</p>
    <p>The flu­id­ity of the sit­u­a­tion has made it harder to plan ac­tiv­i­ties, but it has also pushed in­dus­try play­ers to ex­per­i­ment with new for­mats and pre­pare for the re­open­ing of the travel in­dus­try, said Mr Cheng.</p>
    <p>To this end, HKTB, to­gether with the Hong Kong Qual­ity As­sur­ance Agency, last week launched a stan­dard­ised pro­to­col for hy­giene and anti-epi­demic mea­sures for tourism-re­lated sec­tors.</p>
    <p>The vol­un­tary ini­tia­tive is a move by of­fi­cials to boost con­fi­dence in busi­nesses such as ho­tels, malls and tour op­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>Over the longer term, Hong Kong’s tourism in­dus­try would fo­cus on act­ing as a con­nec­tor of cities in south­ern China for both in­ter­na­tional and do­mes­tic vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>Mr Cheng noted that based on pre-pan­demic data, al­most 80 per cent of the to­tal vis­i­tors com­ing to Hong Kong are from the main­land.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, 60 per cent of the to­tal vis­i­tor ar­rivals are from Ma­cau and Guang­dong prov­ince, which to­gether with Hong Kong form the Greater Bay Area.</p>
    <p>“So, it would be like that for a lot of vis­i­tors in the fu­ture – when they come to Hong Kong, it is not just com­ing to Hong Kong, but they would also make a side trip us­ing the high-speed rail or mega bridge to the Greater Bay Area.”</p>
    <p>Cit­ing Shang­hai as an ex­am­ple, he said vis­i­tors there see it as an in­ter­na­tional gate­way and would nat­u­rally go to Ningbo, Hangzhou and other nearby places from the city.</p>
    <p>He sees Hong Kong in a sim­i­lar role, with ef­forts to pro­mote the Greater Bay Area over­seas as “it has a lot to of­fer”.</p>
