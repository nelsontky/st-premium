    <p>RE­VIEW / CON­CERT SSO ON­LINE CON­CERT: DE­BUSSY & DVO­RAK Sin­ga­pore Sym­phony Orches­tra – Hans Graf (con­duc­tor), Gul­nara Mashurova (harp) Vic­to­ria Con­cert Hall/Last Satur­day</p>
    <p>On the face of it, this was just an­other in the se­ries of on­line con­certs by the Sin­ga­pore Sym­phony Orches­tra (SSO).</p>
    <p>In re­al­ity, this con­cert was very dif­fer­ent, fea­tur­ing SSO mem­bers recorded be­fore last Satur­day un­der the di­rec­tion of chief con­duc­tor Hans Graf, who had flown in un­der spe­cial per­mis­sion to work with the mu­si­cians with pre­cau­tions dic­tated by safe dis­tanc­ing rules.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme of works by Claude De­bussy and An­tonin Dvo­rak was in­formed by the lim­ited num­bers of mu­si­cians al­lowed, but well re­flected Graf’s love of the two composers, and his de­sire to broaden the SSO’s reper­toire with pieces for small en­sem­bles.</p>
    <p>This was most clearly demon­strated in the open­ing work, the con­duc­tor’s own ar­range­ment for string ensem­ble of De­bussy’s String Quar­tet, a quar­tet that in its time smashed the norms of form, style and tonal­ity.</p>
    <p>Graf’s ar­range­ment was true to De­bussy’s orig­i­nal, us­ing sec­tions in most of the work, but re­turn­ing to solo in­stru­ments when greater trans­parency and del­i­cate­ness was called for.</p>
    <p>Vi­o­lin­ist Chan Yoong-Han led the 17 well-dis­tanced play­ers, show­ing all evening why he is one of the most highly sought af­ter cham­ber mu­si­cians in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Graf’s tempo for the first move­ment was un­usu­ally leisurely, giv­ing it a broad, grandiose de­meanour. In con­trast, record­ings by the Scot­tish Ensem­ble and Ebene Quar­tet take about a minute.</p>
    <p>The mu­si­cians have not had the chance to play to­gether since be­fore the cir­cuit breaker, and some resid­ual in­er­tia was in­evitable. This was soon ban­ished, and the fol­low­ing move­ments had greater ease and en­ergy.</p>
    <p>De­bussy’s Danses Sacree Et Pro­fane For Harp & Strings fea­tured SSO prin­ci­pal harpist Gul­nara Mashurova as soloist in the work, writ­ten to show off the then new “chro­matic harp”, which was be­ing in­tro­duced by in­stru­ment mak­ers Pleyel.</p>
    <p>Although the French ti­tle of the work trans­lates di­rectly to Sa­cred and Pro­fane Dances, the lat­ter refers to a grace­ful, less rev­erend, but in no way sac­ri­le­gious dance.</p>
    <p>Mashurova played with ef­fort­less musicality on her pedal harp.</p>
    <p>In a video-recorded per­for­mance, the vis­ual el­e­ment is al­most as im­por­tant as the au­ral, and her very grace­ful mo­tion over the strings was a de­light.</p>
    <p>There was a won­der­ful sense of bal­ance from the first, march-like chords of the Ser­e­nade For Winds by Dvo­rak. While the strings played in re­duced forces in the pre­vi­ous pieces, the ser­e­nade em­ployed the SSO winds in their “nat­u­ral” num­bers and they rev­elled in the ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>The mu­si­cians were spaced even fur­ther apart than the strings were, but there was a unity in the play­ing.</p>
    <p>It seemed a pity to have the cello and bass pushed way to the right, where their uni­fy­ing ef­fect was di­min­ished. Nev­er­the­less, there was spirit, el­e­gance and great play­ing through­out by all sec­tions.</p>
    <p>With high-def­i­ni­tion sound and video, on­line stream­ing de­mands not just ex­cel­lent play­ing, but also au­dio play­back and videog­ra­phy to match.</p>
    <p>On this reviewer’s fairly well tuned set-up, au­dio qual­ity was poor com­pared with how the SSO sounds on CD or even YouTube. Videog­ra­phy was patchy – from good in the De­bussy Dances to poor in the Ser­e­nade, miss­ing many sec­tion so­los and even the glo­ri­ous horn fan­fare in the fi­nale.</p>
    <p>Still, it was a treat to watch and hear the SSO mu­si­cians play in this “al­most live” con­cert.</p>
    <p>The con­sid­er­able ef­fort by mae­stro Graf and the SSO to make this hap­pen should be ap­plauded, even if there was no au­di­ence al­lowed in the hall.</p>
