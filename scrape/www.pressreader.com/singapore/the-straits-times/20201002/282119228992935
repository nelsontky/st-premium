    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity (SMU) is link­ing up with two of In­done­sia’s top uni­ver­si­ties to of­fer ex­change pro­grammes for stu­dents and fac­ulty, as well as pro­mote greater shar­ing of the three in­sti­tu­tions’ ed­u­ca­tional re­sources.</p>
    <p>Un­der the agree­ments signed yes­ter­day, SMU will also be col­lab­o­rat­ing with Univer­si­tas In­done­sia (UI) and In­sti­tut Te­knologi Ban­dung (ITB) on re­search ar­eas like dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion, sus­tain­able liv­ing and growth in Asia. They are now in pre­lim­i­nary dis­cus­sions and will be launch­ing joint pro­grammes within the next 12 months.</p>
    <p>SMU pres­i­dent Lily Kong signed a me­moran­dum of un­der­stand­ing (MOU) each with the rec­tors of UI and ITB. The sign­ing was wit­nessed by In­done­sia’s Min­is­ter for Ed­u­ca­tion and Cul­ture Nadiem Makarim.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Kong said: “The new MOUs on aca­demic co­op­er­a­tion with UI and ITB un­der­score the com­mon in­ter­ests and com­mit­ment of SMU and our two In­done­sian part­ners to de­velop new gen­er­a­tions of glob­al­ready and re­spon­si­ble ci­ti­zens for Sin­ga­pore and In­done­sia through ed­u­ca­tional col­lab­o­ra­tions.”</p>
    <p>Mr Nadiem, the founder of ride-hail­ing firm Go­jek, noted that col­lab­o­ra­tion in higher ed­u­ca­tion, be it be­tween schools and in­dus­try play­ers, other in­sti­tu­tions or in­ter­na­tional part­ners, is key for stu­dents to achieve suc­cess in the cur­rent global econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“The over­ar­ch­ing prin­ci­ple is that in or­der for stu­dents to leave the aca­demic pro­gramme, and have rel­e­vancy in the work­force and rel­e­vancy in the world of en­trepreneur­ship... We need to re­ally fo­cus on sim­u­lat­ing as much as pos­si­ble sit­u­a­tions that they will en­counter in the real world,” said Mr Nadiem, who stud­ied in Sin­ga­pore and the United States.</p>
    <p>“So the over­ar­ch­ing strat­egy to in­crease rel­e­vancy is to ac­tu­ally ac­cel­er­ate the cross-pol­li­na­tion of the higher ed­u­ca­tion ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter was speak­ing at a di­a­logue with Prof Kong, where they dis­cussed his vi­sion and plans for higher ed­u­ca­tion in In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>Mr Nadiem said that ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tions in his coun­try have to take learn­ing out­side of cam­pus. Some uni­ver­si­ties in In­done­sia have their stu­dents go through a six-month pe­riod of off-cam­pus learn­ing, be it ex­change pro­grammes, in­tern­ships or ex­ter­nal projects, he added.</p>
    <p>Do­ing so would al­low them to gain ex­pe­ri­ence which they would oth­er­wise not have if they spent their whole aca­demic life in their in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>More than 8,000 busi­ness, govern­ment and aca­demic lead­ers, as well as stu­dents, tuned in to the di­a­logue yes­ter­day, which was held on video­con­fer­enc­ing plat­form Zoom.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to a ques­tion from one of the at­ten­dees on how the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion will af­fect the way peo­ple learn, Mr Nadiem said that there is a mis­per­cep­tion that e-learn­ing and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence will re­place phys­i­cal schools and in-per­son teach­ing in a post-pan­demic world.</p>
    <p>Even as stu­dents un­der­take more project-based ini­tia­tives and pur­sue vo­ca­tional-based projects, they will still need face-to-face in­ter­ac­tions with peers, teach­ers and learn­ing part­ners, said the min­is­ter, who added that hy­brid mod­els of learn­ing where stu­dents at­tend a mix of face-to-face and on­line lessons would likely be the fu­ture in higher ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>He said: “But what will be per­ma­nent is the use of tech­nol­ogy in en­hanc­ing the class ex­pe­ri­ence. Make it more ef­fi­cient, make it more dy­namic, make it more fun and util­is­ing mul­ti­ple chan­nels of in­for­ma­tion me­dia in or­der to en­gage stu­dents – that will be per­ma­nent.”</p>
    <p>TO IN­CREASE REL­E­VANCY</p>
    <p>We need to re­ally fo­cus on sim­u­lat­ing as much as pos­si­ble sit­u­a­tions that they (stu­dents) will en­counter in the real world. So the over­ar­ch­ing strat­egy to in­crease rel­e­vancy is to ac­tu­ally ac­cel­er­ate the cross-pol­li­na­tion of the higher ed­u­ca­tion ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
