    <p>The United States nu­clear weapons agency and at least three states were hacked as part of a sus­pected Rus­sian cy­ber at­tack that struck a num­ber of fed­eral govern­ment agen­cies. Mi­crosoft was also breached, and its prod­ucts were used to fur­ther at­tacks on oth­ers, Reuters re­ported.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>SAN FRAN­CISCO The United States nu­clear weapons agency and at least three states were hacked as part of a sus­pected Rus­sian cy­ber at­tack that struck a num­ber of fed­eral govern­ment agen­cies.</p>
    <p>Mi­crosoft was also breached, and its prod­ucts were used to fur­ther at­tacks on oth­ers, Reuters re­ported.</p>
    <p>The soft­ware giant said it de­tected a ma­li­cious ver­sion of soft­ware from tech­nol­ogy firm So­larWinds in­side the com­pany, but that its in­ves­ti­ga­tion so far showed no ev­i­dence hack­ers had used Mi­crosoft sys­tems to at­tack cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Mi­crosoft is a user of Orion, the widely de­ployed net­work­ing man­age­ment soft­ware f rom So­larWinds, which was used in the sus­pected Rus­sian at­tacks on US agen­cies and oth­ers.</p>
    <p>The com­pany also had its own prod­ucts lever­aged to at­tack vic­tims, said sources fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The US Na­tional Se­cu­rity Agency is­sued a rare “cy­ber-se­cu­rity ad­vi­sory” on Thurs­day de­tail­ing how cer­tain Mi­crosoft Azure cloud ser­vices may have been com­pro­mised by hack­ers and di­rect­ing users to lock down their sys­tems.</p>
    <p>“Like other So­larWinds cus­tomers, we have been ac­tively look­ing for in­di­ca­tors of this ac­tor and can con­firm that we de­tected ma­li­cious So­larWinds bi­na­ries in our en­vi­ron­ment, which we iso­lated and re­moved,” a Mi­crosoft spokesman said, adding that the com­pany had found “no in­di­ca­tions that our sys­tems were used to at­tack oth­ers”.</p>
    <p>One of the sources said the hack­ers made use of Mi­crosoft cloud of­fer­ings while avoid­ing the firm’s cor­po­rate in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>The com­pany did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to ques­tions about the tech­nique.</p>
    <p>Still, an­other source said the Depart­ment of Home­land Se­cu­rity (DHS) does not be­lieve Mi­crosoft was a key av­enue of fresh in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Both Mi­crosoft and the DHS, which on Thurs­day said the hack­ers used mul­ti­ple meth­ods of en­try, are con­tin­u­ing to in­ves­ti­gate.</p>
    <p>The Depart­ment of En­ergy and its Na­tional Nu­clear Se­cu­rity Ad­min­is­tra­tion, which main­tains Amer­ica’s nu­clear stock­pile, were tar­geted as part of the larger at­tack, ac­cord­ing to a source.</p>
    <p>An on­go­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tion has found the hack did not af­fect “mis­sion-es­sen­tial na­tional se­cu­rity func­tions”, Ms Shay­lyn Hynes, a Depart­ment of En­ergy spokesman, said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“At this point, the in­ves­ti­ga­tion has found that the mal­ware has been iso­lated to busi­ness net­works only,” Ms Hynes said.</p>
    <p>The hack of the nu­clear agency was re­ported ear­lier by Politico.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, two sources fa­mil­iar with the broader govern­ment in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the at­tack said three states were breached, though they would not iden­tify the states.</p>
    <p>A third source fa­mil­iar with the probe con­firmed that states were hacked but did not pro­vide a num­ber.</p>
    <p>In an ad­vi­sory on Thurs­day that sig­nalled the widen­ing alarm over the breach, the Cy­ber­se­cu­rity and In­fra­struc­ture Se­cu­rity Agency said the hack­ers posed a “grave risk” to fed­eral, state and lo­cal gov­ern­ments, as well as crit­i­cal in­fra­struc­ture and the pri­vate sec­tor.</p>
    <p>The agency said the at­tack­ers demon­strated “so­phis­ti­ca­tion and com­plex trade­craft”.</p>
    <p>While US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has yet to pub­licly ad­dress the hack, Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den is­sued a state­ment on Thurs­day on “what ap­pears to be a mas­sive cy­ber-se­cu­rity breach af­fect­ing po­ten­tially thou­sands of vic­tims, in­clud­ing US com­pa­nies and fed­eral govern­ment en­ti­ties”.</p>
    <p>“I want to be clear: My ad­min­is­tra­tion will make cy­ber se­cu­rity a top pri­or­ity at every level of govern­ment – and we will make deal­ing with this breach a top pri­or­ity from the mo­ment we take of­fice,” Mr Bi­den said, pledg­ing to im­pose “sub­stan­tial costs on those re­spon­si­ble for such ma­li­cious at­tacks”.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia has de­nied any in­volve­ment in the at­tack.</p>
    <p>Mi­crosoft spokesman Frank Shaw did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Ms Hynes said that ef­forts were im­me­di­ately taken to mit­i­gate the risk from the hack, in­clud­ing dis­con­nect­ing soft­ware “iden­ti­fied as be­ing vul­ner­a­ble to this at­tack”.</p>
