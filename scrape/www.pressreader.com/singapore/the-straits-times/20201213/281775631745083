    <p>LON­DON • Four Royal Navy pa­trol ships will be ready on Jan 1 to help pro­tect Bri­tain’s fish­ing wa­ters in the event the Brexit tran­si­tion pe­riod ends with­out a deal on fu­ture ties with the Euro­pean Union, said the Bri­tish Min­istry of De­fence (MOD).</p>
    <p>There are con­cerns about pos­si­ble skir­mishes be­tween Bri­tish and for­eign fish­ing ves­sels if no trade deal is reached, with ex­ist­ing tran­si­tional rules that give EU boats ac­cess to Bri­tish wa­ters set to ex­pire at the end of the year.</p>
    <p>“The MOD has con­ducted ex­ten­sive plan­ning and prepa­ra­tion to en­sure that de­fence is ready for a range of sce­nar­ios at the end of the tran­si­tion pe­riod,” said an MOD spokesman.</p>
    <p>The 80m-long navy ves­sels will have the power to stop, check and im­pound all EU fish­ing boats op­er­at­ing within Bri­tain’s ex­clu­sive eco­nomic zone (EEZ), which can ex­tend 320km from shore.</p>
    <p>The Guardian news­pa­per re­ported ear­lier that two ves­sels will be de­ployed at sea with two on standby in case EU fish­ing boats en­ter the EEZ.</p>
    <p>Mr To­bias Ell­wood, a Con­ser­va­tive Party law­maker who chairs the Bri­tish Par­lia­ment’s de­fence se­lect com­mit­tee, was crit­i­cal of the devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>“We’re just fac­ing the prospect of... our over­stretched Royal Navy squar­ing up to a close Nato ally over fish­ing ves­sel rights,” he told BBC ra­dio. “Our ad­ver­saries must be re­ally en­joy­ing this.”</p>
    <p>A French min­is­ter said on Thurs­day that France would com­pen­sate its fish­er­men and take other mea­sures to help them if talks on a trade deal col­lapse, in an ef­fort to avoid clashes at sea.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain quit the EU in Jan­uary but re­mains an in­for­mal mem­ber un­til Dec 31 – the end of a tran­si­tion pe­riod dur­ing which it has re­mained in the EU sin­gle mar­ket and Cus­toms union.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son and Euro­pean Com­mis­sion chief Ur­sula von der Leyen said on Fri­day it was now un­likely a trade deal would be agreed. They have given their ne­go­tia­tors un­til to­day be­fore a de­ci­sion is made on whether to keep talk­ing or give up.</p>
    <p>The trade talks have been dead­locked over the ex­tent of EU ac­cess to Bri­tish fish­ing grounds and rules gov­ern­ing fair com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain also plans to fast-track the move­ment of some per­ish­able goods when the tran­si­tion pe­riod ends, as part of ef­forts to deal with ex­pected dis­rup­tion at its ports, the BBC re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish gov­ern­ment has warned that even with a trade deal with the EU, 7,000 trucks head­ing for Chan­nel ports in south-east Eng­land could be held in 100km­long queues if com­pa­nies do not pre­pare the ex­tra pa­per­work re­quired.</p>
    <p>The is­sue was dis­cussed on Fri­day at a meet­ing of the Kent Re­silience Fo­rum of emer­gency ser­vices, of­fi­cials and busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>The BBC said a pre­sen­ta­tion it had seen iden­ti­fied room to fast­track be­tween 70 and 100 lor­ries of per­ish­able foods a day.</p>
    <p>It said the fo­cus will be on live and fresh seafood, of­ten trans­ported from Scot­land to French restau­rants, and day-old chicks.</p>
    <p>It said no other com­modi­ties have been added to the list, which has wor­ried other food ex­porters.</p>
    <p>The BBC added that el­e­ments of the sys­tem are be­ing tested this week­end.</p>
    <p>Trucks head­ing to­wards the English port of Dover were stuck in long queues on Thurs­day and Fri­day.</p>
