    <p>The job mar­ket perked up dur­ing the third quar­ter, but Sin­ga­pore is not out of the woods yet and re­cov­ery may be a long process. A Min­istry of Man­power mar­ket re­port yes­ter­day shows that em­ploy­ment rose among res­i­dents to near pre-Covid-19 lev­els, while job va­can­cies were up for the first time this year.</p>
    <p>The job mar­ket perked up in the third quar­ter, but Sin­ga­pore is not out of the woods yet and re­cov­ery may be a long process.</p>
    <p>A Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) mar­ket re­port yes­ter­day shows that em­ploy­ment rose among res­i­dents to near pre-Covid-19 lev­els, while job va­can­cies were up for the first time this year.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts said these are pos­i­tive signs that the labour mar­ket de­cline is mod­er­at­ing.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dent em­ploy­ment was up by 43,200 to 2.34 mil­lion in Septem­ber, just 0.4 per cent lower than in the same month last year.</p>
    <p>But re­trench­ments still rose in the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>There were 49,600 job va­can­cies in Septem­ber, sea­son­ally ad­justed, up from 42,400 in June.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the sup­port mea­sures for lo­cal em­ploy­ment played a key role in sta­bil­is­ing the job mar­ket, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>These in­clude the Jobs Sup­port Scheme and National Wages Coun­cil guide­lines, which helped to pre­serve a strong Sin­ga­porean core across all sec­tors, she added.</p>
    <p>The SGUnited Jobs and Skills Pack­age saw a higher-than-ex­pected take-up of po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>Al­most 60,000 lo­cal job seek­ers were placed into work and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties un­der the pack­age from April to Oc­to­ber, the MOM said in its weekly jobs re­port, also out yes­ter­day. More than 120,000 open­ings are still avail­able.</p>
    <p>Other in­di­ca­tors also point to labour mar­ket im­prove­ment. To­tal em­ploy­ment ex­clud­ing for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers de­clined by 29,100 in the third quar­ter, a much slower pace com­pared with the plunge of 103,800 in the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>While the sea­son­ally ad­justed over­all un­em­ploy­ment rate rose in Septem­ber to 3.6 per cent, it was at a slower pace than the months be­fore. But re­trench­ments con­tin­ued to rise, hit­ting 9,120 in the third quar­ter, from 8,130 in the sec­ond.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo warned that chal­lenges lie ahead as the na­ture of jobs changes. “We are mind­ful that mov­ing for­ward, we will still see re­trench­ments and peo­ple mak­ing tran­si­tions as trans­for­ma­tion ef­forts con­tinue.”</p>
    <p>Ex­perts agreed that while there are glim­mers of hope, it will not be all smooth sail­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Selena Ling, OCBC Bank’s head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy, said: “For 2021 as a whole, the over­all and res­i­dent un­em­ploy­ment rates may still be slow to re­turn to pre-Covid lev­els due to the long-tail na­ture of the pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>She added that re­trench­ment might still climb as some firms may not sur­vive.</p>
    <p>May­bank Kim Eng se­nior econ­o­mist Chua Hak Bin noted that em­ploy­ment is re­cov­er­ing more slowly than eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity. “With lo­cal em­ploy­ment on the mend, the big ques­tion for busi­nesses and the econ­omy is whether for­eign em­ploy­ment will also start to turn around.”</p>
    <p>National Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness School’s As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lawrence Loh said: “What is more wor­ry­ing is re­trench­ment due to struc­tural mis­match, which means that the ex­ist­ing jobs be­come ob­so­lete and new or higher skills are needed.”</p>
    <p>Per­ma­nent Sec­re­tary for Man­power Aubeck Kam said: “Covid-19 has also ac­cel­er­ated the pace of busi­ness trans­for­ma­tion, and we have to pre­pare that un­like cycli­cal down­turns, some jobs may not re­turn. (Thus), labour mar­ket re­cov­ery may con­tinue well be­yond the im­me­di­ate re­bound but may re­main pro­tracted.”</p>
    <p>The ma­jor­ity of job place­ments un­der the SG United Jobs and Skills ini­tia­tive were in the health­care sec­tor be­tween April and Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>The bulk of these were long-term jobs in health­care pro­fes­sional and ex­ec­u­tive roles, and health­care sup­port and ad­min­is­tra­tive sup­port roles, said the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) yes­ter­day in its fi­nal jobs sit­u­a­tion re­port for the year.</p>
    <p>The health­care sec­tor was also one of the top five sec­tors with the most num­ber of job and train­ing place­ments un­der the ini­tia­tive – a to­tal of 4,200 place­ments.</p>
    <p>The other four sec­tors were in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions, man­u­fac­tur­ing, pro­fes­sional ser­vices and fi­nan­cial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>In terms of jobs and train­ing roles, the in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions sec­tor saw the high­est num­ber of place­ments at 6,900. Of these, about 70 per cent were com­pany-hosted trainee­ships and at­tach­ments as well as train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties. The man­u­fac­tur­ing, pro­fes­sional ser­vice and fi­nan­cial ser­vice sec­tors each saw about 2,700 job and train­ing place­ments, with the ma­jor­ity be­ing long-term jobs.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, there are more than 123,000 jobs and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties still avail­able un­der the SG United ini­tia­tive. Nearly three in four, or 91,300, of these are jobs, with most of them be­ing long-term jobs, said MOM.</p>
    <p>Of the long-term jobs, about 73 per cent are for pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs), while about 48 per cent of the avail­able short-term jobs are for PMETs.</p>
    <p>The sec­tors with the high­est num­ber of avail­able job and train­ing open­ings are in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions (21,000), food ser­vices (11,300), pro­fes­sional ser­vices (11,000), man­u­fac­tur­ing (10,800) and health­care (7,200).</p>
    <p>In the in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions sec­tor, avail­able roles in­clude those in soft­ware, Web and ap­pli­ca­tion de­vel­op­ers.</p>
    <p>Other roles such as cus­tomer suc­cess man­ager and dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing spe­cial­ist may be suit­able for job seek­ers with­out in­fo­comm tech­nol­ogy back­ground or ex­pe­ri­ence, said MOM.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said it will con­tinue to fo­cus on match­ing more job seek­ers with avail­able open­ings, to­gether with unions and em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>Job seek­ers who wish to join the in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions sec­tor can tap place­ment pro­grammes such as the Tech Skills Ac­cel­er­a­tor Mid-Ca­reer Ad­vance, where they can gain job ex­pe­ri­ence in ar­eas such as user ex­pe­ri­ence/in­ter­face de­sign de­vel­op­ment and dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing.</p>
    <p>Mid-ca­reer in­di­vid­u­als who are in­ter­ested in the health­care sec­tor can ap­ply for pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­grammes, or sign up for com­pany-hosted trainee­ship and at­tach­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to the me­dia dur­ing a visit to United Over­seas Bank yes­ter­day, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo high­lighted three pri­or­i­ties for next year.</p>
    <p>The first is to help the econ­omy re­cover by bring­ing in new ac­tiv­i­ties and help­ing com­pa­nies trans­form.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, em­ploy­ers will have to con­tinue build­ing up their lo­cal work­force for the trans­for­ma­tion of var­i­ous in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal pri­or­ity is to help job seek­ers have greater aware­ness of where new op­por­tu­ni­ties are and to sup­port them in tran­si­tion­ing to these new roles and in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said that while the jobs sit­u­a­tion has largely sta­bilised, “there is still a lot of work to do”.</p>
    <p>“Much as we are glad that we have ar­rived at a point where we are on a fairly sound foot­ing, it is not time to cel­e­brate,” she added. “In fact, we want to re­dou­ble our ef­forts and help as many em­ploy­ers and job seek­ers as pos­si­ble to make that tran­si­tion.”</p>
    <p>She also thanked the three-way part­ner­ship of MOM, NTUC and the Sin­ga­pore National Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion for ef­forts in help­ing to sta­bilise the em­ploy­ment mar­ket. “Head­ing to­wards 2021, I think we are on fairly firm ground and we have our work cut out for us, and that is what we will fo­cus on.”</p>
