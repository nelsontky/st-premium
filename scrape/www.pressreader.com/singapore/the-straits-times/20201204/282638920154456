    <p>In re­cent years, sus­tain­abil­ity in fash­ion has be­come an in­creas­ingly ur­gent is­sue to ad­dress, con­sid­er­ing the in­dus­try’s im­pact on the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>The path to sus­tain­abil­ity, how­ever, is not a straight­for­ward one.</p>
    <p>Some brands have pledged to be more trans­par­ent about their man­u­fac­tur­ing, while oth­ers have taken the easy route of car­bon off­set­ting.</p>
    <p>There is also a smaller group of more thought­ful de­sign­ers who look at the big­ger pic­ture.</p>
    <p>They take in the amount of waste that is al­ready ram­pant and upcycle it, giv­ing new life to “dead­stock”, dis­carded or vin­tage fab­rics.</p>
    <p>One of the most prom­i­nent young de­sign­ers work­ing in this sphere is Emily Adams Bode.</p>
    <p>Since launch­ing Bode in 2016, she has been scoop­ing up in­dus­try ac­co­lades – in­clud­ing the Emerg­ing De­signer of the Year ti­tle at last year’s CFDA Fash­ion Awards.</p>
    <p>Bode made her de­but at Paris Fash­ion Week last year, where her vi­sion of home­spun, eclec­tic nostal­gia im­me­di­ately stood out.</p>
    <p>Her aes­thetic is rooted in work­wear, but com­posed of an­tique fab­rics such as old ki­monos, Vic­to­rian bed linens, quilts, tow­els, table­cloths and cur­tains – all lov­ingly em­broi­dered and patch­worked.</p>
    <p>Match­es­Fash­ion.com was one of the ear­li­est re­tail­ers to buy into Bode’s vi­sion.</p>
    <p>Ms Natalie King­ham, its fash­ion and buy­ing di­rec­tor, says: “The brand’s ar­ti­sanal DNA res­onates well with our cus­tomers. The lim­ited na­ture of the pieces makes them feel like mod­ern heir­looms.</p>
    <p>“The bowl­ing-style shirts con­tinue to be pop­u­lar due to the nos­tal­gic fit, beau­ti­ful fab­ri­ca­tions and in­tri­cate em­broi­dery.”</p>
    <p>Vin­tage fab­rics nat­u­rally come loaded with his­tory and the deftest de­sign­ers are able to tap into this</p>
    <p>to cre­ate some­thing mean­ing­ful.</p>
    <p>For Priya Ah­luwalia, who launched Ah­luwalia in 2018, this means sourc­ing her ma­te­ri­als from In­dia and Nige­ria – where her fa­mil­ial roots are and where most of the West­ern fash­ion world’s waste is dis­carded – and then re­pur­pos­ing them in Lon­don, where she is based.</p>
    <p>Ah­luwalia’s work draws from both her own im­mi­grant ex­pe­ri­ence and the di­verse mu­sic scene she grew up ob­serv­ing in 1990s Lon­don.</p>
    <p>And, in a tes­ta­ment to the fash­ion es­tab­lish­ment’s be­lief in her ap­proach, she was an­nounced as one of the joint win­ners of this year’s LVMH Prize.</p>
    <p>The brand is also stocked at Match­es­Fash­ion.com.</p>
    <p>The re­tailer’s head of menswear, Mr Damien Paul, says: “We were ini­tially drawn to the strong and pow­er­ful Ah­luwalia aes­thetic – the brand has such a clear iden­tity. Then, when we in­ves­ti­gated fur­ther, her re­search in­spired us as we l earnt how she finds the tex­tiles and brings them back to life again.</p>
    <p>“Her ap­proach is unique and su­per for­ward-think­ing, and we knew the clothes would at­tract this re­ally mod­ern guy who is fo­cused on fash­ion, but also keen to un­der­stand the jour­ney of what he’s buy­ing.”</p>
    <p>Some de­sign­ers also fac­tor in so­cial en­trepreneur­ship.</p>
    <p>Cue Bethany Wil­liams, who founded her name­sake brand in 2017.</p>
    <p>She sources re­cy­cled or dead­stock fab­rics, and works with home­less shel­ters and prisons to pro­vide em­ploy­ment to marginalis­ed com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>For all the pro­gres­sive ideals baked into them, the clothes also stand on their own with cheer­ful col­lages and patch­works of colour and pat­tern.</p>
    <p>For her work, Wil­liams re­ceived the Queen El­iz­a­beth II Award for Bri­tish De­sign last year.</p>
    <p>The proof that up­cy­cling is the way for­ward lies in the fact that the prac­tice has trick­led up to even the big­gest brands, which are start­ing to work with archival or dead­stock fab­rics.</p>
    <p>As the pan­demic forces a greater reck­on­ing with the ways peo­ple cre­ate and con­sume, it has be­come clear this is a great leap in the right di­rec­tion.</p>
