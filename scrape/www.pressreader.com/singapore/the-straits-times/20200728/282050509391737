    <p>Mr Wong Yang, one of two re­cip­i­ents of the Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings (SPH) jour­nal­ism schol­ar­ship this year, earned his stripes as a green­horn jour­nal­ist cov­er­ing an un­prece­dented pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In his six months in­tern­ing at The New Pa­per be­fore he re­ceived the award, the 21-year-old did a se­ries of sto­ries on how do­mes­tic work­ers, mi­grant work­ers in dorms and Malaysian work­ers were af­fected by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>He said yes­ter­day be­fore the schol­ar­ship cer­e­mony that the ex­pe­ri­ence ce­mented his be­lief that jour­nal­ism is a force for so­cial change, re­in­forc­ing his de­ter­mi­na­tion to pur­sue it as a ca­reer.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing a jour­nal­ist gives me the priv­i­lege of lis­ten­ing to peo­ple who may be on the mar­gins of so­ci­ety, and putting their perspectiv­es on the page.</p>
    <p>“It is im­por­tant that we cap­ture the is­sues they are fac­ing so that Sin­ga­pore­ans may em­pathise and think about how we can treat them bet­ter,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong will be read­ing com­par­a­tive lit­er­a­ture and so­cial an­thro­pol­ogy, a di­rect Master of Arts (Hon­ours) course at the Univer­sity of St An­drews in Scot­land, be­fore re­turn­ing to SPH as a full-time jour­nal­ist.</p>
    <p>The other jour­nal­ism schol­ar­ship re­cip­i­ent, 24-year-old Os­mond Chia – who also in­terned at The New Pa­per – is cur­rently pur­su­ing a de­gree in com­mu­ni­ca­tion stud­ies at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity (NTU).</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus was a con­stant theme at the vir­tual awards cer­e­mony held yes­ter­day, where three dif­fer­ent types of schol­ar­ships were handed out to 29 re­cip­i­ents.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 14 in-house schol­ar­ships were given to chil­dren of SPH staff and news­pa­per ven­dors. A fur­ther 13 Lim Kim San Me­mo­rial Schol­ar­ships were handed out to stu­dents from mod­est fam­ily back­grounds.</p>
    <p>One re­cip­i­ent of the Lim Kim San Me­mo­rial Schol­ar­ship, Ms Ade­lena Oh, said the pan­demic caused eco­nomic hard­ship in her fam­ily and dis­rupted her plans to save up enough money to teach English in Ja­pan for a few years.</p>
    <p>For now, the schol­ar­ship, which comes with no bond, will help her fo­cus on her English un­der­grad­u­ate stud­ies at NTU with­out hav­ing to worry about whether she can af­ford to get through each se­mes­ter.</p>
    <p>It will also help edge her to­wards her life goal of giv­ing those who</p>
    <p>Be­ing a jour­nal­ist gives me the priv­i­lege of lis­ten­ing to peo­ple who may be on the mar­gins of so­ci­ety, and putting their perspectiv­es on the page. It is im­por­tant that we cap­ture the is­sues they are fac­ing so that Sin­ga­pore­ans may em­pathise and think about how we can treat them bet­ter.</p>
    <p>PRIV­I­LEGE OF LIS­TEN­ING</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>MR WONG YANG, one of two re­cip­i­ents of the Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings jour­nal­ism schol­ar­ship this year.</p>
    <p>need ex­tra sup­port a leg-up, although she is still ex­plor­ing her ca­reer op­tions as to which will best ful­fil this pur­pose.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old cur­rently works part time at a cafe that hires at-risk youth, and said that she hopes to of­fer them friend­ship as her men­tor once did for her when she was a “re­bel­lious and angsty teen”.</p>
    <p>“The award will help me im­mensely in work­ing to­wards my long-term goal of us­ing sto­ries, var­i­ous lan­guages and dig­i­tal me­dia to em­power youth from trou­bled back­grounds, un­con­ven­tional fam­ily units and di­verse cul­tures to reach their full po­ten­tial.”</p>
    <p>In his speech at the cer­e­mony, chair­man of SPH and SPH Foun­da­tion Lee Boon Yang said Covid-19 has dis­rupted the lives of both young and old and re­vealed the im­por­tance of cred­i­ble me­dia in peo­ple’s lives. Said Dr Lee: “Me­dia pro­vides cred­i­ble news and in­for­ma­tion to the com­mu­nity... More peo­ple are turn­ing to trusted me­dia sources for re­li­able in­for­ma­tion to cope with the un­cer­tain­ties brought on by the coro­n­avirus.”</p>
    <p>To the award re­cip­i­ents, he added: “De­spite the un­cer­tain­ties that swirl around us cur­rently, you should fo­cus on your stud­ies. Armed with a good ed­u­ca­tion, your fu­ture will be bright and fruit­ful.”</p>
