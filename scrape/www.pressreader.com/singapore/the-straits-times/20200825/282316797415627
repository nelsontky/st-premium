    <p>BOS­TON Dustin John­son is tar­get­ing a lengthy stay at the top of the world rankings af­ter re­claim­ing the No. 1 spot with an 11-shot vic­tory at the PGA Tour North­ern Trust Open on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The 36-year-old Amer­i­can be­came the fifth player to be the topranked player this year af­ter he leapfrogge­d Spain’s Jon Rahm, fel­low Amer­i­can Justin Thomas and Ul­ster­man Rory McIlroy fol­low­ing his dom­i­nat­ing dis­play at TPC Bos­ton.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­triot Brooks Koepka has also held the No. 1 sta­tus this year and the con­stant churn has been the most since the rankings started in 1986.</p>
    <p>John­son last held the No. 1 rank­ing in May last year and it is an ac­co­lade he holds dear to his heart, hav­ing been on top for 91 weeks to­tal – the fifth-long­est pe­riod in his­tory.</p>
    <p>“It’s some­thing that I’m very proud of is to be No. 1 in the world, and I’d like to stay there for a lit­tle while,” he told re­porters. “Ob­vi­ously, it’s been jump­ing around a bunch here the last few months, but the last time I was No. 1, I stayed there for quite some time, and that’s another goal of mine is just to see how long I can stay at No. 1.”</p>
    <p>The North­ern Trust Open was the first of three play-off events that cul­mi­nate with the Sept 4-7 Tour Cham­pi­onship in At­lanta and the US$15 mil­lion prize (S$20.53 mil­lion) to the FedEx­Cup cham­pion.</p>
    <p>John­son is de­ter­mined to fin­ish as the sea­son’s cham­pion for the first time in his ca­reer.</p>
    <p>“It’s some­thing I’ve been close to win­ning a few times, and it’s just some­thing that I would re­ally like to have on my re­sume when I’m done play­ing golf,” the 2016 US Open cham­pion said af­ter card­ing an eight-un­der 63 for a to­tal of 30-un­der 254. “It’s a big ti­tle. It means a lot to all the guys out here.”</p>
    <p>Whether 15-time Ma­jor cham­pion Tiger Woods will be in At­lanta re­mains to be seen, hav­ing only played three tour­na­ments since the Tour’s re­sump­tion in June.</p>
    <p>But de­spite fin­ish­ing 24 shots be­hind John­son, he was en­cour­aged by his fi­nal round of 66, his low­est of the year.</p>
    <p>Re­veal­ing he was start­ing to find his “rhythm and flow”, the for­mer world No. 1 said: “I wish I’d have played a bit bet­ter this week to make it a lit­tle bit eas­ier on me next week to try to get into East Lake, but this is go­ing to be... a busy stretch ei­ther way.”</p>
    <p>For the golfers aim­ing to be­come the first FedEx­Cup cham­pion from Asia, The North­ern Trust was not a good out­ing.</p>
    <p>China’s Zhang Xin­jun is out of the this week’s top-70 BMW Cham­pi­onship – the sec­ond play-off event – af­ter miss­ing the cut.</p>
    <p>South Korean Im Sung-jae, who also failed to make the week­end, fell to eighth in the stand­ings from fifth.</p>
