    <p>A woman re­peat­edly abused her fam­ily’s do­mes­tic helper be­tween Jan­uary and April 2018 by acts such as slap­ping the woman’s face and pulling her hair.</p>
    <p>Un­able to tol­er­ate any more abuse from Nuur Au­dadi Yu­soff, the In­done­sian maid, Ms Sulis Se­ty­owati, 24, climbed out of the 15th­storey flat’s bal­cony and made her way down to the ground floor of the block in Yishun.</p>
    <p>At the time of the of­fences, Nuur was a Sing­tel em­ployee de­ployed to sup­port a Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) con­tact cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The 31-year-old Sin­ga­porean pleaded guilty yes­ter­day to six counts of as­sault.</p>
    <p>Ms Sulis be­gan work­ing for Nuur on Dec 1, 2017, and was paid $580 a month. Some time af­ter mid­night the fol­low­ing month, Nuur was awak­ened by her daugh­ter’s cries and found that Ms Sulis had for­got­ten to ap­ply oint­ment on the child’s stom­ach.</p>
    <p>En­raged, Nuur spat at the maid and slapped her face twice. The abuse con­tin­ued in Fe­bru­ary 2018 with acts such as drag­ging the maid by her hair.</p>
    <p>When Ms Sulis asked for a trans­fer, Nuur promised not to hit her again and the younger woman con­tin­ued work­ing there as she needed to send money home to sup­port her child.</p>
    <p>But Nuur went back to her old ways just 10 days later when she scrolled through Ms Sulis’ mo­bile phone and found that the maid had up­loaded pic­tures of Nuur’s chil­dren on Face­book.</p>
    <p>Deputy Public Pros­e­cu­tor Chong Kee En said: “The ac­cused was upset at the pho­tos. She was an­gry and slapped the vic­tim on her face with the phone and with her hand sev­eral times be­fore throw­ing the phone to the ground caus­ing it to crack.”</p>
    <p>The court heard that Nuur con­fis­cated the de­vice and as­saulted the maid al­most daily for about a week af­ter this.</p>
    <p>On April 29 that year, Ms Sulis man­aged to re­trieve her mo­bile phone and hid it as she wanted to call her agency to ask for a trans­fer.</p>
    <p>When Nuur re­alised that the phone was miss­ing, she con­fronted the maid, who de­nied tak­ing it. She then as­saulted the maid.</p>
    <p>Ms Sulis was sit­ting on the floor the next day when Nuur pulled her hair and kicked her head a few times be­fore leav­ing for work.</p>
    <p>When Nuur re­turned home that evening, she called Ms Sulis a “pros­ti­tute”. Nuur later used a broom to re­peat­edly strike the maid’s head and back.</p>
    <p>Ms Sulis de­cided to run away at around 2am the next day and es­caped through the bal­cony as the front door was locked.</p>
    <p>Nuur’s bail was set at $10,000 yes­ter­day and she will be sen­tenced on Nov 18.</p>
