    <p>About 4,900 ci­ti­zen sci­en­tists helped to col­lect data on birds and other wildlife for Na­tional Parks Board’s free e-book, A Re­view Of</p>
    <p>Gar­den Bird Watch</p>
    <p>Mr Lim Poh Chuan (left) was not con­tent to be a ci­ti­zen sci­en­tist just to study birds in the Gar­den Bird Watch pro­gramme or­gan­ised by the Na­tional Parks Board (NParks).</p>
    <p>The 55-year-old prod­uct com­pli­ance man­ager at Hewlett Packard En­ter­prise says that af­ter his ini­tial avian stint in 2017, he also signed up for NParks’ Heron Watch, But­ter­fly Watch and the lat­est Drag­on­fly Watch this year.</p>
    <p>“This has al­lowed me to gain bet­ter in­sight into bio­di­ver­sity, which I would not oth­er­wise have in my daily life,” says Mr Lim, who en­joys slather­ing mos­quito re­pel­lent to trudge through wet­lands and forests to jot down notes about wildlife.</p>
    <p>Ci­ti­zen sci­en­tists like Mr Lim are typ­i­cally mem­bers of the pub­lic with no spe­cific train­ing, but who vol­un­teer to study and help col­lect data re­lat­ing to the nat­u­ral world as part of a col­lab­o­ra­tive project with pro­fes­sion­ally trained sci­en­tists.</p>
    <p>“Once, when I was bird­watch­ing at the Southern Ridges, a Greater Racket-Tailed Drongo (an Asian species with dis­tinc­tive long tail feath­ers) at­tacked me twice,” says Mr Lim, who re­alised that he had in­truded into the bird’s ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter I backed off, it perched on a tree and stared at me till I walked away. I took this as an ex­am­ple of re­spect­ing one an­other’s space.”</p>
    <p>An­other ci­ti­zen sci­en­tist, Ms Ivie Sim (left be­low), was touched by na­ture too, but in a dif­fer­ent way.</p>
    <p>“My most mem­o­rable and lifechang­ing ex­pe­ri­ence was wit­ness­ing the trans­for­ma­tion of the Kal­lang River at Bis­han-Ang Mo Kio Park from a con­crete canal to a nat­u­ralised water­way,” says Ms Sim, 30, an as­sis­tant de­vel­op­ment man­ager at prop­erty group Lendlease.</p>
    <p>“Not only did the re­vi­talised river in­spire me to pur­sue a de­gree in en­vi­ron­men­tal en­gi­neer­ing and con­tinue to ad­vo­cate sus­tain­abil­ity in my work, but I was also for­tu­nate to be able to meet the fa­mous Bis­han ot­ter fam­ily, get closer to the white­breasted wa­ter­hens in the river and be awak­ened by the dawn cho­rus of the res­i­dent Asian koel birds.”</p>
    <p>This del­i­cate co­ex­is­tence be­tween hu­mans and na­ture is among NParks’ top pri­or­i­ties as Sin­ga­pore tran­si­tions into a City in Na­ture, from a City in a Gar­den in the 1990s to 2000s, and a Gar­den City in 1967.</p>
    <p>NParks’ City i n Na­ture vi­sion en­tails adding an ad­di­tional 200ha of na­ture parks by 2030. It is work­ing with the com­mu­nity to plant more than one mil­lion trees across Sin­ga­pore, ramp­ing up ex­ist­ing tree-plant­ing ef­forts from 50,000 to 100,000 trees an­nu­ally.</p>
    <p>With more green­ery comes more wildlife, par­tic­u­larly birds which are seen by NParks as one of the bench­marks of a healthy ecosys­tem.</p>
    <p>It says birds are ideal eco­log­i­cal in­di­ca­tors be­cause they are sen­si­tive to changes in the en­vi­ron­ment and are rel­a­tively easy to spot.</p>
    <p>The board started its Com­mu­nity in Na­ture Bio­di­ver­sity Watch se­ries in 2015 with the first Gar­den Bird Watch se­ries which at­tracted about 400 ci­ti­zen sci­en­tists.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, NParks launched the re­sults of a five-year field study dis­till­ing in­for­ma­tion from 10 edi­tions of the bird watches into a free e-book ti­tled A Re­view Of Gar­den Bird Watch (2015-2019) in col­lab­o­ra­tion with about 4,900 ci­ti­zen sci­en­tists.</p>
    <p>The vol­un­teers have helped spot 184 bird species across 64 sites on the is­land from na­ture re­serves to heart­land parks dur­ing the breed­ing sea­son in April and mi­gra­tory sea­son in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>In the book, Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Des­mond Lee shares an anec­dote about a Spot­ted Wood Owl which flew into his home a few years ago and perched on a ledge.</p>
    <p>“It seemed to ac­knowl­edge my pres­ence by giv­ing me a wink be­fore fly­ing off to a nearby tree,” writes Mr Lee in the fore­word, which also fea­tures his snap­shot of the noc­tur­nal bird of prey, freeze­framed in full wink mode.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>The next edi­tion of the ci­ti­zen sci­ence ini­tia­tive Gar­den Bird Watch is from Nov 6 to 15. Regis­tra­tion is open to the pub­lic to sign up be­fore Oct 1 at go.gov.sg/gb­wn2020reg</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>A Re­view Of Gar­den Bird Watch (2015-2019) is avail­able for free from NParks’ web­site (go.gov.sg/gb­w­book). Lim­ited hard­copy ver­sions sell for $15 at Gar­dens Shops at the Sin­ga­pore Botanic Gar­dens.</p>
