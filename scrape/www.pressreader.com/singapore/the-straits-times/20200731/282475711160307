    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, lots of peo­ple got turned on to cook­ing and bak­ing to keep sane. I did a lot of that too. But I stuck to sim­ple things. Com­pli­cated, multi-step recipes with lists of in­gre­di­ents longer than the eye can see are not for me.</p>
    <p>So I baked bread, made cook­ies and grilled fish and was happy to leave some things to the ex­perts. Saybons, the home-grown chain which serves crepes and soup, has a ha­lal off­shoot called Savoir and it of­fers the sorts of things I would never think to make.</p>
    <p>Case in point: prawn noo­dle soup. Amass­ing prawn shells in the freezer is one thing, but then hav­ing to fry and sim­mer them to ex­tract ev­ery last bit of flavour de­feats me.</p>
    <p>The path of least re­sis­tance would be to get a pouch of Sin­ga­pore Prawn Soup ($5.90 for 500g, right). The flavour is ro­bust and the soup is thick and rich. Drink as is and you will find it too salty, as I did. But if you thin it out with water and add bee­hoon, kangkong and prawns, you will have a quick and easy hae mee that serves two to three.</p>
    <p>The other one I like is Green Curry Chicken Stew ($7.90 for a 500g pouch). It is filled with chunks of chicken thigh and egg­plant. The pouch serves two and I would add only some chopped fresh co­rian­der or basil leaves and mop up the gravy with bread. That I baked, of course.</p>
