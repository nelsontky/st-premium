    <p>It is heart­break­ing to read about the tragic case of Tan Tian Chye (Man who killed men­tally ill daugh­ter freed from jail af­ter sen­tence back­dated, Oct 13).</p>
    <p>Based on what was re­ported, my first re­sponse was: “If only the daugh­ter agreed to the treat­ment rec­om­mended, the out­come would likely be a hap­pier one.”</p>
    <p>Although Part III of the Men­tal Ca­pac­ity Act caters for some ac­tions to be taken in con­nec­tion with the care and treat­ment of per­sons with men­tal dis­or­ders, this case clearly shows that the law is not com­pre­hen­sive enough to en­sure that the treat­ment be given.</p>
    <p>How can we ex­pect a per­son who has been di­ag­nosed with a men­tal dis­or­der to solely de­cide that he has the right to ac­cept or refuse treat­ment, when the re­fusal of such treat­ment can re­sult in phys­i­cal and psy­cho­log­i­cal harm to fam­ily mem­bers?</p>
    <p>Should the Act be en­hanced to make treat­ment (in­clud­ing ad­mis­sion to an ap­pro­pri­ate care fa­cil­ity) com­pul­sory for such se­vere cases?</p>
    <p>Look­ing at Tan’s case, the par­ents were the real vic­tims and should be con­sid­ered vul­ner­a­ble adults suf­fer­ing from phys­i­cal and psy­cho­log­i­cal abuse from their daugh­ter un­der the Vul­ner­a­ble Adults Act.</p>
    <p>They were in­ca­pable of pro­tect­ing them­selves from the abuse and un­rea­son­able con­trol by their daugh­ter. They were the ones who needed pro­tec­tion or­ders.</p>
    <p>Why was the abuse not de­tected and ad­dressed at that time?</p>
    <p>Feed­back from the ground sug­gests that such cases are not un­com­mon.</p>
    <p>It seems to sug­gest that there is weak­ness in early de­tec­tion and di­ag­no­sis, lack of ac­cess to high-qual­ity care, and lack of pro­gres­sive poli­cies and prac­tices.</p>
    <p>These are the same kinds of chal­lenges fac­ing Sin­ga­pore as it strives to be­come a more de­men­tia-in­clu­sive so­ci­ety, as re­ported in the global de­men­tia in­no­va­tion readi­ness in­dex by the US-based Global Coali­tion on Ag­ing, Bri­tain-based Alzheimer’s Dis­ease In­ter­na­tional and Sin­ga­pore’s Lien Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>This sug­gests that such short­falls may be sys­temic is­sues across the na­tional health­care in­fra­struc­ture, par­tic­u­larly in senior and men­tal health care.</p>
    <p>As the per­cent­age of those with men­tal ill­ness rises in an age­ing pop­u­la­tion, where el­derly par­ents are forced to look af­ter adult chil­dren with men­tal ill­ness, I urge the Gov­ern­ment to ad­dress the is­sues quickly, se­ri­ously and holis­ti­cally.</p>
