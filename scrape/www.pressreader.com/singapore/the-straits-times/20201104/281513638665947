    <p>Lim­ited quan­ti­ties of $1,000 ban­knotes will be is­sued from now un­til the end of next month. From Jan 1, the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore will stop is­su­ing these notes.</p>
    <p>The Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) will stop is­su­ing the $1,000 note from Jan­uary next year, to min­imise the money-laun­der­ing and ter­ror­ism-fi­nanc­ing risks as­so­ci­ated with such a large de­nom­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>From now till the end of next month, the MAS will also limit the quan­tity of $1,000 notes is­sued, although banks can con­tinue re­cir­cu­lat­ing the ex­ist­ing $1,000 notes that have been de­posited with them, it said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It added that it will “make avail­able suf­fi­cient quan­ti­ties of other de­nom­i­na­tions” to meet de­mand, in par­tic­u­lar the $100 note, which is the next high­est de­nom­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Ex­ist­ing $1,000 notes in cir­cu­la­tion can con­tinue to be used for pay­ment, and re­main le­gal ten­der, said the cen­tral bank.</p>
    <p>It also en­cour­aged the public to use elec­tronic pay­ments in­stead of large de­nom­i­na­tion notes, which it said al­lows in­di­vid­u­als to anony­mously carry large sums of money, and can thus fa­cil­i­tate il­licit ac­tiv­i­ties like money laun­der­ing.</p>
    <p>MAS stopped is­su­ing $10,000 notes in Oc­to­ber 2014 for the same rea­sons, not­ing that there was less need for high-value cash trans­ac­tions, with the developmen­t of more ad­vanced and se­cure elec­tronic pay­ment sys­tems.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lawrence Loh, who is di­rec­tor of the Cen­tre for Gov­er­nance, In­sti­tu­tions and Or­gan­i­sa­tions, said elec­tronic pay­ment sys­tems are still more se­cure than cash, de­spite the cy­ber risks as­so­ci­ated with e-pay­ments.</p>
    <p>“You are able to se­cure two things with e-pay­ments, firstly, in terms of tech­ni­cal se­cu­rity, you can trace where your money is go­ing, and sec­ond, you have phys­i­cal se­cu­rity be­cause you don’t have to carry large amounts of cash,” he said, adding that the move was timely, if not over­due.</p>
    <p>He noted that most peo­ple al­ready do not use the $1,000 note, as there is “no rea­son” for trans­ac­tions to be car­ried out in cash, in­stead of via cheques or bank trans­fers.</p>
    <p>MAS noted in its state­ment that most ma­jor ju­ris­dic­tions have also stopped is­su­ing large de­nom­i­na­tion notes be­cause of money-laun­der­ing and ter­ror­ism-fi­nanc­ing con­cerns.</p>
    <p>Cur­rency col­lec­tors spec­u­late that the price of the $1,000 note will likely ap­pre­ci­ate with dwin­dling sup­ply.</p>
    <p>Ban­knote and coin buyer Lau­rence Lau, 64, said prices of the “nicer” notes, like those with aus­pi­cious se­rial num­bers, could ap­pre­ci­ate by as much as 5 per cent to 15 per cent of its real value.</p>
    <p>“The news will give a gen­eral mar­ket uplift to all the high-value de­nom­i­na­tion notes, which has been lan­guish­ing for some time,” said Mr Lau, who runs the Coins and Coins ban­knote and coin deal­er­ship.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple have a strange men­tal­ity – they only want things in lim­ited sup­ply,” he added.</p>
