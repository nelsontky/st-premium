    <p>A 24-year-old man, who was roped in by an­other man to take part in a three­some with the lat­ter’s girlfriend with­out her knowl­edge and con­sent, was sen­tenced to 17 years and 10 months’ jail and 14 strokes of the cane for rape and other sex­ual of­fences yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>High Court judge Pang Khang Chau found that Sri­hari Ma­hen­dran played a sub­or­di­nate role in the trysts to the “real mas­ter­mind” – the woman’s then boyfriend who had re­cruited him to ful­fil his fan­tasy of watch­ing an­other man have sex with his girlfriend.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Pang said he could not ig­nore the lead­er­ship role played by the boyfriend, but noted that the boyfriend had pleaded guilty, while Sri­hari had con­tested his charges.</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old boyfriend, a former aux­il­iary po­lice of­fi­cer, is serv­ing a jail term of 19 years and 11 months for abet­ting Sri­hari to rape and sex­u­ally as­sault the vic­tim on two sep­a­rate oc­ca­sions in 2016. He was also sen­tenced to 24 strokes of the cane.</p>
    <p>He can­not be named due to a gag or­der to pro­tect the iden­tity of his former girlfriend.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tor Eu­nice Lau sought at least 19 years’ jail and 18 strokes for Sri­hari, ar­gu­ing that he played a piv­otal role in the en­act­ment of the boyfriend’s de­viant sex­ual fan­tasies.</p>
    <p>She ar­gued that Sri­hari de­rived pleasure from sex­u­ally as­sault­ing the vic­tim and had claimed trial de­spite over­whelm­ing ev­i­dence that he took part in the plan­ning process and the even­tual of­fences.</p>
    <p>Sri­hari’s lawyer, Mr Ravin­der­pal Singh, ar­gued that his client was just 20 years old at the time and is a first-time of­fender.</p>
    <p>Although Sri­hari claimed trial, the vic­tim did not have to take the stand to be cross-ex­am­ined, Mr Singh ar­gued.</p>
    <p>He said Sri­hari should get a jail term of two-thirds of the sen­tence meted out to the boyfriend.</p>
    <p>Sri­hari has en­gaged a new lawyer, Mr Ed­mond Pereira, who told the court that he would be fil­ing an ap­peal against the con­vic­tion.</p>
    <p>Bail was in­creased from $60,000 to $100,000 and Sri­hari will have to wear an elec­tronic tag pend­ing ap­peal.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the trial, the boyfriend tes­ti­fied that he wanted to have a three­some with his girlfriend and an­other man, but she re­jected the idea.</p>
    <p>He then hatched a plan to se­cretly bring an­other man into the ho­tel room to join their sex­ual trysts, while he watched and filmed the sex acts.</p>
    <p>On April 29, 2016, the man let Sri­hari, whom he had met on­line, into a room at Ho­tel 81 Bugis while the vic­tim was bound and blind­folded.</p>
    <p>On Aug 7 that year, he again had Sri­hari join them at M So­cial Ho­tel in Robert­son Quay. This time, she sensed some­thing was wrong, took off her blind­fold and saw a per­son leav­ing. Both men were later ar­rested at the ho­tel.</p>
    <p>Sri­hari was found guilty of four counts of rape, one count of sex­ual as­sault by pen­e­tra­tion, four counts of out­rage of mod­esty, and one count of mak­ing an ob­scene film.</p>
    <p>An 11th charge of trans­mit­ting ob­scene ma­te­rial was taken into con­sid­er­a­tion in sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tor Eu­nice Lau ar­gued that Sri­hari de­rived pleasure from sex­u­ally as­sault­ing the vic­tim and had claimed trial de­spite over­whelm­ing ev­i­dence that he took part in the plan­ning process and the even­tual of­fences.</p>
