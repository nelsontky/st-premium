    <p>1</p>
    <p>BLUNT BLADES COULD RISE WITH GOALS</p>
    <p>One of last sea­son’s suc­cess sto­ries, Sh­effield United are now rooted to the bot­tom of the ta­ble be­cause of their strug­gles in front of goal.</p>
    <p>The Blades have man­aged a mea­gre four Premier League goals this sea­son, and six of their eight league de­feats have come by a one-goal mar­gin.</p>
    <p>That sug­gests a change in for­tunes for the club’s strik­ers, David McGoldrick (two league goals this sea­son), Lys Mous­set (0), Oliver McBurnie (0) and Rhian Brewster (0), could see them climb the ta­ble.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>RICHARLI­SON’S WEL­COME RE­TURN</p>
    <p>Since Richarli­son joined Everton in 2018, they have not won any of the eight Premier League games he has not played in, draw­ing four and los­ing four, in­clud­ing their last three games be­fore Fulham.</p>
    <p>The Brazil for­ward, re­turn­ing af­ter a three-match sus­pen­sion, set up Do­minic Calvert-Lewin’s opener against the Cot­tagers.</p>
    <p>His move­ment on the left flank also al­lowed Lu­cas Digne to bomb for­ward, with the France de­fender cre­at­ing two goals to take his tally of as­sists this sea­son to four.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>VAR WORKS IN BRIGHTON’S FAVOUR</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy took cen­tre stage as Brighton won 2-1 at As­ton Villa, af­ter ref­eree Michael Oliver over­turned his own de­ci­sion to award a penalty to the home side in the dy­ing min­utes, with video as­sis­tant ref­eree (VAR) re­plays vin­di­cat­ing his U-turn.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing viewed the in­ci­dent on a mon­i­tor, Oliver con­ceded his ini­tial verdict was wrong as he saw Solly March get a piece of the ball be­fore mak­ing con­tact with Trezeguet.</p>
    <p>The Seag­ulls held on for their first league win since Septem­ber.</p>
