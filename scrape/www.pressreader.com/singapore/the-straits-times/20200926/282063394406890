    <p>Twenty new an­i­mal species have so far been recorded on Pu­lau Ubin, as part of the first com­pre­hen­sive sur­vey of bio­di­ver­sity on the rus­tic is­land north-east of the main­land.</p>
    <p>The dis­cov­er­ies in­clude Pi­ran­thus sp. , a spi­der species new to sci­ence, found in sec­ondary for­est near the is­land’s coast.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers also found six other an­i­mal species recorded in Sin­ga­pore for the first time, as well as 13 other an­i­mals never be­fore known to be found on Pu­lau Ubin.</p>
    <p>The find­ings of the first Com­pre­hen­sive Ubin Bio­di­ver­sity Sur­vey were an­nounced by Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Des­mond Lee yes­ter­day, ahead of the ninth Ubin Day to­day.</p>
    <p>The event, held an­nu­ally since 2014, aims to cel­e­brate the rich nat­u­ral and cul­tural her­itage of the quarry-dot­ted is­land.</p>
    <p>Due to the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion this year, a se­ries of talks on Pu­lau Ubin-re­lated is­sues, such as the his­tory of the is­land and its rich man­grove habi­tats, will be con­ducted on­line to­day. More de­tails can be found on the Na­tional Parks Board’s (NParks) YouTube page.</p>
    <p>“The unique bio­di­ver­sity found on Pu­lau Ubin is fas­ci­nat­ing. This has been con­firmed by the new find­ings from our Com­pre­hen­sive Ubin Bio­di­ver­sity Sur­vey,” Mr Lee said in a Face­book post. “Let us con­tinue to pre­serve and trea­sure the rus­tic charm and nat­u­ral beauty of Pu­lau Ubin,” he added.</p>
    <p>Pi­ran­thus sp. has been seen in other parts of Sin­ga­pore and in Brunei be­fore. But those sight­ings were wrongly clas­si­fied as be­long­ing to a dif­fer­ent genus.</p>
    <p>It was not un­til the spi­der was found on Pu­lau Ubin dur­ing the sur­vey and closely ex­am­ined by re­searchers that it was de­ter­mined to be a com­pletely new species yet to be de­scribed in sci­en­tific lit­er­a­ture.</p>
    <p>Other new an­i­mal species found in Sin­ga­pore for the first time dur­ing the sur­vey in­clude the ruby­cheeked sun­bird, the swamp tiger but­ter­fly and four other species of spi­ders.</p>
    <p>Mr Khew Sin Khoon, who runs the But­ter­fly Cir­cle (Sin­ga­pore) ci­ti­zen sci­ence blog, said the swamp tiger but­ter­fly, in a serendip­i­tous dis­cov­ery, was found on But­ter­fly Hill on the is­land.</p>
    <p>“The swamp tiger is pretty rare even in Malaysia, and found mainly in man­grove habi­tats like at Kuala Se­lan­gor. My the­ory is that it also ex­ists in the man­grove ar­eas of Jo­hor, and was some­how able to fly over to Ubin,” he said.</p>
    <p>New records for the off­shore is­land in­clude three species of bats, in­clud­ing the black-bearded tomb bat, and birds such as the buf­frumped wood­pecker, as well as species of but­ter­flies, drag­on­flies and dam­sel­flies, and grasshop­pers, crick­ets and katy­dids.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey – which in­volves field sur­veys con­ducted by sci­en­tists and nat­u­ral­ists – started in Jan­uary 2018 and is still on­go­ing for cer­tain an­i­mal groups.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore bi­ol­o­gist N. Si­va­sothi said Pu­lau Ubin plays a vi­tal role for the con­ser­va­tion of wildlife not just in Sin­ga­pore, but also in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>He noted that be­cause the is­land is lo­cated be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia, it serves as a “sink” for an­i­mals from southern Jo­hor, which means an­i­mals from there may come to the is­land. Sim­i­larly, Pu­lau Ubin could also be a source for wildlife in Sin­ga­pore, he said, point­ing to how the once-ex­tinct horn­bills had dis­persed to the main­land from the is­land.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee yes­ter­day also an­nounced plans to make the is­land greener. As part of a One Mil­lion Trees move­ment – an ini­tia­tive an­nounced ear­lier this year which would see a mil­lion trees be­ing planted across Sin­ga­pore over the next decade – 16,000 trees from more than 70 na­tive species will be planted at three sites on Pu­lau Ubin.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Re&#xAD;searchers were sur&#xAD;prised by two new species dis&#xAD;cov&#xAD;ered on Pu&#xAD;lau Ubin, both among 20 dis&#xAD;cov&#xAD;ered dur&#xAD;ing a sur&#xAD;vey of the is&#xAD;land&#x2019;s bio&#xAD;di&#xAD;ver&#xAD;sity. The buff-rumped wood&#xAD;pecker and swamp tiger but&#xAD;ter&#xAD;fly were recorded on the is&#xAD;land for the first time. The wood&#xAD;pecker was for the first time seen on Ubin while the but&#xAD;ter&#xAD;fly was the first record for Sin&#xAD;ga&#xAD;pore. The bird has been found pre&#xAD;vi&#xAD;ously on Sin&#xAD;ga&#xAD;pore is&#xAD;land.&#xD;&#xA;The but&#xAD;ter&#xAD;fly is known to be found in coastal ar&#xAD;eas and man&#xAD;grove swamps in Malaysia.</p>
