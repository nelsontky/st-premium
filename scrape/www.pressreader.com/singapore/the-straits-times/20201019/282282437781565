    <p>In In­done­sia, be­ing seen as ha­lal is se­ri­ous busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Star­bucks and KFC show off their ha­lal cer­ti­fi­ca­tion from the coun­try’s top cler­i­cal body even though the fran­chises are rarely as­so­ci­ated with booze or ba­con.</p>
    <p>But when it comes to bank­ing, In­done­sian house­holds and busi­nesses are less picky.</p>
    <p>Less than 10 per cent of the coun­try’s bank­ing as­sets – busi­ness loans, mort­gages and other lend­ing – are held by the coun­try’s syariah banks, ac­cord­ing to In­done­sia’s Fi­nan­cial Ser­vices Au­thor­ity (OJK).</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the coun­try’s lenders are min­nows in the syariah bank­ing world, hold­ing just 2 per cent of an es­ti­mated US$1.6 tril­lion (S$2.2 tril­lion) in Is­lamic bank­ing as­sets in­clud­ing sukuk – Is­lamic-com­pli­ant bonds.</p>
    <p>That is well be­hind Malaysia, which holds more than 11 per cent, ac­cord­ing to data from the Is­lamic Fi­nan­cial Ser­vices Board (IFSB), the mul­ti­lat­eral or­gan­i­sa­tion over­see­ing syariah bank­ing.</p>
    <p>That may be chang­ing, as In­done­sia’s syariah banks are on a rel­a­tive tear dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. OJK data shows lend­ing up by more than 20 per cent so far this year as their con­ven­tional cousins, which tend to of­fer big­ger loans for longer pe­ri­ods, step back.</p>
    <p>Syariah banks get around charg­ing i nter­est on l oans through profit shar­ing ar­range­ments or act­ing as an in­ter­me­di­ary, buy­ing an as­set like a car on be­half of the client with an agreed re­pay­ment sched­ule.</p>
    <p>Last Tues­day, the In­done­sian gov­ern­ment an­nounced that it would merge the syariah units of three state-owned lenders to cre­ate the coun­try’s sev­enth-largest bank.</p>
    <p>Pend­ing ap­proval by reg­u­la­tors, the syariah units of Bank Rakyat In­done­sia, Bank Mandiri and Bank Ne­gara In­done­sia will join forces by Fe­bru­ary to form a lender with roughly 215 tril­lion ru­piah (S$19.8 bil­lion) in as­sets – just un­der half of all Is­lamic bank­ing as­sets in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>With its ex­tra heft, the new bank will be bet­ter placed to raise funds at more com­pet­i­tive rates, S&P said in an an­a­lyst note last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“The merger will en­able the syariah bank to have the ca­pac­ity to gen­er­ate more busi­nesses, be­com­ing part of the global sukuk, and hav­ing the po­ten­tial to be ranked among the top 10 global syariah banks based on mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion,” Mr Erick Tho­hir, Min­is­ter of State-owned En­ter­prises, told The Straits Times in a writ­ten com­ment.</p>
    <p>The move is part of an on­go­ing ef­fort among In­done­sian of­fi­cials to cap­ture a big­ger slice of the mar­ket of re­li­giously ob­ser­vant Mus­lims. The mar­ket is thought to be worth around US$2.2 tril­lion, ac­cord­ing to the IFSB.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pan­demic, is­lands in­clud­ing Lom­bok and the au­ton­o­mous re­gion of Aceh, which has its own syariah-based crim­i­nal code, were reg­u­larly bandied as po­ten­tial ha­lal hol­i­day hot spots that can serve as an al­ter­na­tive to Bali.</p>
    <p>A 2014 law re­quir­ing con­sumer prod­ucts and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals to de­clare whether they com­ply with Is­lamic law by avoid­ing, among other things, pork or al­co­hol, will be­gin go­ing into ef­fect in 2022.</p>
    <p>Even so, In­done­sia’s Is­lamic banks are strug­gling un­der a pile of bad debt j ust like their con­ven­tional coun­ter­parts across the coun­try. Dud l oans among syariah banks, known as non-per­form­ing fi­nanc­ing (NPF), stood at 3.3 per cent at the end of July. By com­par­i­son, they were 3.22 per cent for all In­done­sian banks.</p>
    <p>Last year, the NPF at Bank Mua­malat, In­done­sia’s first syariah bank, neared 5 per cent, re­sult­ing in a 3.2 tril­lion ru­piah bailout by a con­sor­tium led by Mr Il­ham Ak­bar Habi­bie, the son of the late for­mer pres­i­dent B.J. Habi­bie. An­a­lysts say the sec­tor is ham­strung by poor risk man­age­ment rel­a­tive to the con­ven­tional sec­tor.</p>
    <p>By com­par­i­son, Malaysia’s syariah bank­ing sec­tor dates back to 1983, pre­dat­ing In­done­sia’s by a decade and was part of a con­certed of­fi­cial ef­fort to lift liv­ing stan­dards among eth­nic Malays by coax­ing them into open­ing bank ac­counts and to bor­row.</p>
    <p>Loans in Malaysia, too, can be more flex­i­ble and are less re­liant on col­lat­eral, an­a­lysts say.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia’s syariah banks are in­creas­ingly a gov­ern­ment pri­or­ity, in­stead of be­ing left to fend for them­selves, Mr Rifki Is­mail, as­sis­tant di­rec­tor of Bank In­done­sia’s depart­ment of syariah eco­nomics and fi­nance, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“We were us­ing a bot­tom-up ap­proach. Now, it is top-down,” he said. “We are fol­low­ing the suc­cess story of Malaysia.”</p>
