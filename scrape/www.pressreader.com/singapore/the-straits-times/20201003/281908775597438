    <p>Indonesian teenager Sari (not her real name) got preg­nant and tied the knot when she was 14 years old.</p>
    <p>The mar­riage lasted all of two years.</p>
    <p>She re­turned to her vil­lage in Bo­gor, West Java, to live with her mother. Then in March this year, the coro­n­avirus out­break struck the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Now with an in­fant to look af­ter and with­out a job, 17-year-old Sari re­mar­ried in Au­gust to take the fi­nan­cial bur­den off her fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“What can I do? Maybe this is my des­tiny. I am ashamed to have to trou­ble my mother,” she told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“If some­one wants to marry me and seems suit­able, why not? Maybe I’ll have bet­ter luck this time. I just hope to be a good wife.”</p>
    <p>Her hus­band, a farmer 10 years her se­nior, is some­one she knows well, she added.</p>
    <p>In In­done­sia, fe­males can legally marry with parental con­sent at 19.</p>
    <p>The le­gal age for mar­ry­ing was raised from 16, fol­low­ing an amend­ment in the 1974 Mar­riage Law in Septem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>Males can also marry with parental con­sent when they turn 19, as has al­ways been the case.</p>
    <p>With­out parental con­sent, the law­ful mar­riage age for both men and women is 21.</p>
    <p>Yet, child brides are not un­com­mon in the South-east Asian coun­try of 270 mil­lion peo­ple, a third of whom are chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Unicef, In­done­sia has the eighth-high­est num­ber of child mar­riages in the world, with one in nine fe­males mar­ry­ing be­fore turn­ing 18.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Min­istry of Women Em­pow­er­ment and Child Pro­tec­tion, the district and re­li­gious courts have re­ceived 34,413 ap­pli­ca­tions be­tween Jan­uary and June this year from par­ents and guardians seek­ing le­gal per­mis­sion, lo­cally known as “mar­riage dis­pen­sa­tion”, that would al­low their chil­dren to get mar­ried be­fore they are 19 years old.</p>
    <p>Most of the ap­pli­ca­tions were ap­proved.</p>
    <p>Ms Ro­hika Kur­niadi Sari, the min­istry’s deputy as­sis­tant for par­ent­ing, fam­ily and the en­vi­ron­ment, told ST on Thurs­day that these ap­pli­ca­tions in­cluded some for mi­nors, but the ex­act num­ber has yet to be es­tab­lished.</p>
    <p>Be­sides tra­di­tion and cul­tural at­ti­tudes, eco­nomic fac­tors also play a part in un­der­age mar­riages, es­pe­cially in crises, from nat­u­ral dis­as­ters to pan­demics.</p>
    <p>With re­trench­ments and salary cuts due to Covid-19, some des­per­ate fam­i­lies have pushed their young daugh­ters into mar­riage, Ms Ro­hika said.</p>
    <p>“They think the hus­bands are now re­spon­si­ble for the wel­fare of their daugh­ters and not them,” she said. “This is not right and it may lead to psy­cho­log­i­cal trauma, child labour, drop­ping out of school, health prob­lems such as stunt­ing and uter­ine bleed­ing, and struc­tural poverty.”</p>
    <p>There were 23,792 “mar­riage dis­pen­sa­tion” ap­pli­ca­tions to wed un­der-16 girls and un­der-19 boys last year. There were 13,484 such ap­pli­ca­tions in 2018 and 12,579 in 2017.</p>
    <p>Dis­re­gard­ing this year’s spike, a slightly down­ward trend in the preva­lence of un­der­age mar­riages is no­tice­able. Pop­u­la­tion cen­sus data showed that the per­cent­age of women be­tween the ages of 20 and 24 who were mar­ried be­fore they turned 18 was 11.54 per cent in 2017, 11.21 per cent in 2018 and 10.82 per cent last year.</p>
    <p>Aca­demi­cians and women ac­tivists say there is anec­do­tal ev­i­dence link­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic to a surge in child mar­riages.</p>
    <p>Ms Lia Ang­giasih, of the na­tional sec­re­tariat for Indonesian Women’s Coali­tion, told ST that the par­tial lock­down had forced schools to close and chil­dren to study from home.</p>
    <p>“The youth do not have many ac­tiv­i­ties to do af­ter com­plet­ing their on­line lessons,” she said. “Feel­ing bored, they end up meet­ing their boyfriends or girl­friends more fre­quently. This, in turn, made their par­ents worry that they may in­dulge in pre­mar­i­tal sex. So the so­lu­tion is to marry them off early.”</p>
    <p>Ac­tivists also fear that poverty caused by the pan­demic would fur­ther force more girls into mar­riage as fam­i­lies found them­selves in eco­nomic difficulty.</p>
    <p>Ms Lia spoke of a case a few years back, where a father mar­ried off his 12-year-old daughter to a much older man to set­tle his gam­bling debts.</p>
    <p>“To us, this sim­ply means hu­man traf­fick­ing,” she said.</p>
    <p>In many cases, girls forced into mar­riage are scared to speak up and go against their fam­i­lies’ wishes. Some are too young to un­der­stand what is hap­pen­ing, said Ms Laras Su­santi, a lec­turer in the law fac­ulty at Gad­jah Mada Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Par­ents who were not granted le­gal per­mis­sion by the court to marry off their chil­dren tend to wed them in a “nikah siri”, an un­of­fi­cial and un­reg­is­tered se­cret mar­riage that is not au­tho­rised by the state or by the re­li­gious au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Ms Laras said greater aware­ness among author­ity fig­ures such as judges, cus­tom­ary re­li­gious lead­ers, and teach­ers, as well as ed­u­cat­ing the gen­eral pub­lic more about it, might be a bet­ter way to tackle un­der­age mar­riage.</p>
    <p>“The judges will have to lis­ten (to find out) if the chil­dren were pres­sured to marry or they’re do­ing it out of their own free will,” she said.</p>
    <p>BET­TER LUCK THIS TIME</p>
    <p>I am ashamed to have to trou­ble my mother. If some­one wants to marry me and seems suit­able, why not? Maybe I’ll have bet­ter luck this time.</p>
