    <p>Is­lamic De­fend­ers Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shi­hab re­turned from Saudi Ara­bia on Nov 10, the Na­tional Heroes’ Day in In­done­sia, af­ter a three-year self-im­posed ex­ile, call­ing for a “moral rev­o­lu­tion” to save the coun­try.</p>
    <p>“In a moral rev­o­lu­tion, dis­obe­di­ent peo­ple be­come pi­ous. Let us erad­i­cate in­jus­tice, agree? Let us erad­i­cate cor­rup­tion, agree?” he said in his first re­marks to a crowd of keen fol­low­ers.</p>
    <p>But the charis­matic preacher, 55, has been em­broiled in many crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions. Among the most con­tro­ver­sial ones was an al­leged sex scan­dal with a fe­male sup­porter named Firza Hu­sein, whose nude photos and mes­sages ex­changed with Mr Rizieq on What­sApp were leaked and cir­cu­lated on­line in early 2017.</p>
    <p>He was sub­se­quently charged un­der In­done­sia’s anti-pornog­ra­phy law, which was iron­i­cally passed in 2006 with his strong sup­port. How­ever, he fled to Saudi Ara­bia in April 2017 be­fore the po­lice could in­ter­ro­gate him. The charge, and an­other re­lated to Mr Rizieq’s al­leged at­tack against the state ide­ol­ogy Pan­casila, was later dropped.</p>
    <p>From Saudi Ara­bia, the cleric con­tin­ued to ex­ert his in­flu­ence on In­done­sia’s pol­i­tics vir­tu­ally. He once ap­peared in a video shown dur­ing a ma­jor cam­paign rally for Mr Prabowo Su­bianto, the only op­po­nent of Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo in last year’s presidenti­al elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Rizieq was pre­vi­ously im­pris­oned at least twice. In 2003, he was sen­tenced to seven months in jail for op­pos­ing law en­forcers and or­der­ing his vig­i­lante group FPI to at­tack a num­ber of Jakarta’s night en­ter­tain­ment venues, which they con­demned as “im­moral places”. He also served 11/</p>
    <p>2 years in prison af­ter the group, un­der his com­mand, was found guilty of at­tack­ing an al­liance that fought for re­li­gious free­dom in 2008.</p>
    <p>Hu­man rights groups have recorded nu­mer­ous vi­o­lent as­saults by the FPI against mi­nori­ties, such as Ah­madiyahs and Chris­tians.</p>
    <p>Plu­ral­ism ad­vo­cates have also re­ported Mr Rizieq, a cham­pion of syariah law, for in­sult­ing cul­tural val­ues and re­li­gious be­liefs of oth­ers as well as spread­ing ha­tred.</p>
    <p>While in the past, the FPI was mostly known for its no­to­ri­ous “sweep­ing op­er­a­tions” in bars and ho­tels dur­ing the Ra­madan fast­ing month, it be­came more prom­i­nent af­ter the fire­brand cleric led a massive sec­tar­ian move­ment in 2016 against then Jakarta gover­nor Ba­suki Tja­haja Pur­nama, pop­u­larly known as Ahok. Mr Ba­suki, a Chi­nese-Chris­tian politi­cian, lost in the 2017 gu­ber­na­to­rial elec­tion and was con­victed of blas­phemy against Is­lam. He was jailed for two years.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers be­lieve that de­spite his con­tro­ver­sial track record, Mr Rizieq is a fig­ure to watch in In­done­sia’s pol­i­tics as Is­lamist groups in the world’s largest Mus­lim-ma­jor­ity na­tion are con­sol­i­dat­ing their power for the 2024 presidenti­al and leg­isla­tive elec­tions.</p>
