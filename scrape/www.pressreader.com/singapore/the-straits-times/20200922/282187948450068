    <p>The Euro­pean Union will un­leash as many green bonds as the world is­sued last year, test­ing the level of in­vestor in­ter­est in fi­nanc­ing a shift to­wards cleaner economies.</p>
    <p>The bloc plans to cre­ate up to €225 bil­lion (S$360 bil­lion) of green debt, which will pro­pel it from a de­but is­suer to the largest player in the nascent market in com­ing years.</p>
    <p>With no set def­i­ni­tion on what makes a green bond, its cri­te­ria are likely to set a bench­mark stan­dard for oth­ers to fol­low. The plans are un­doubt­edly a big win for the in­dus­try – just four years af­ter the first sov­er­eign green bond is­suance. Yet the EU’s ef­forts will gauge whether such as­sets can at­tract main­stream funds out­side Europe, or find de­mand lim­ited to an en­thu­si­as­tic but spe­cialised group of in­vestors.</p>
    <p>“From a market point of view, a devel­op­ment point of view and a cli­mate change point of view,” said Mr Mitch Reznick, the head of sus­tain­able fixed in­come at Her­mes Fund Man­agers, the EU’s of­fer­ings are “go­ing to al­ter the land­scape”.</p>
    <p>“From a value point of view, this works best for the­matic funds, where value isn’t nec­es­sar­ily the pri­mary driver.”</p>
    <p>The huge is­suance plan is the lat­est to fund pan­demic res­cue pack­ages, lead­ing to a surge in global debt. So far there has been no short­age of de­mand for green as­sets, thanks to a boom in en­vi­ron­men­tally-con­scious in­vest­ing.</p>
    <p>These spe­cialised funds helped Ger­many’s de­but green bond this month at­tract five times as many or­ders as the debt avail­able.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of sus­tain­able in­dex mu­tual funds and ex­change-traded funds and their as­sets of US$250 bil­lion (S$340 bil­lion) have both dou­bled in the past three years, ac­cord­ing to Morn­ingstar.</p>
    <p>The EU’s cli­mate chief Frans Tim­mer­mans sees this deeper pool of in­vestors as an op­por­tu­nity for the bloc to fund change.</p>
    <p>Deutsche Bank’s head of sus­tain­able fi­nance Tr­isha Taneja said: “De­mand will con­tinue to out­strip sup­ply at least in the near term.”</p>
    <p>The EU is step­ping into a rel­a­tively small market, worth around US$80 bil­lion. Gov­ern­ments have lagged be­hind firms in is­su­ing green bonds, though the pace is pick­ing up: Those look­ing set to fol­low Ger­many may in­clude Italy, Kenya and Brazil.</p>
    <p>In the United States, a win for Demo­crat pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den in Novem­ber’s elec­tion could mean a boom for green fi­nance, given his US$5 tril­lion cli­mate plan.</p>
    <p>Ger­many’s en­try into the market could spark a flurry of is­suance from other coun­tries, said Mr Colin Fin­layson, co-man­ager of the Ae­gon Strate­gic Bond Fund. Still, “as an in­vest­ment al­ter­na­tive to con­ven­tional or tra­di­tional bonds, it is not yet clear whether green bonds will of­fer a su­pe­rior re­turn”, he added.</p>
    <p>“In­ter­est and de­mand will come from those who are mak­ing a con­scious de­ci­sion to sup­port a gov­ern­ment’s ef­forts to invest in sus­tain­able projects.”</p>
