    <p>I re­fer to Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Man­power Zaqy Mo­hamad’s con­cerns that a “right to dis­con­nect” law may be too rigid (Bosses to get guide on work­ers’ men­tal health by year end, Oct 7).</p>
    <p>I be­lieve such leg­is­la­tion is not only fea­si­ble, but also very nec­es­sary in Singapore.</p>
    <p>Mr Zaqy wor­ries that such laws may hin­der work­ers who en­joy flex­i­ble work­ing hours. I be­lieve that lee­way for them is not un­think­able.</p>
    <p>Us­ing a re­cent ex­am­ple, work­ers who can­not don masks in the course of their work are ex­empted from the gen­eral rule re­quir­ing one to wear a mask out­side their home.</p>
    <p>In the same vein, em­ploy­ers may be ex­empted in cer­tain sit­u­a­tions from a gen­eral ban on con­tact­ing em­ploy­ees out­side of reg­u­lar of­fice hours. These sit­u­a­tions in­clude where an em­ployee has worked less than eight hours a day or where an em­ployer pays an over­time rate for such con­tact. Such ex­emp­tions may also be granted on ap­pli­ca­tion to and ap­proval by the rel­e­vant min­istry.</p>
    <p>To use another ex­am­ple, the Le­gal Pro­fes­sion (Qual­i­fied Per­sons) Rules al­low law school grad­u­ates to ap­ply to the Min­is­ter for Law for ex­emp­tion from cer­tain re­quire­ments for ad­mis­sion to the Bar.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, em­ploy­ers who have gen­uine rea­sons to con­tact their em­ploy­ees out­side of reg­u­lar of­fice hours may be al­lowed to ap­ply to the Man­power Min­is­ter to be ex­empted from a gen­eral ban on such con­tact.</p>
    <p>That such laws are a new phe­nom­e­non should not be a rea­son not to en­act them.</p>
    <p>Singapore is no stranger to be­ing a pi­o­neer in the field of leg­is­la­tion. In fact, we were re­cently one of the first ju­ris­dic­tions in the world to pass anti-fake news leg­is­la­tion.</p>
    <p>This shows that our leg­is­la­tors are clearly cre­ative enough to en­act leg­is­la­tion that is not “too rigid”.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, Mr Zaqy has ac­knowl­edged that work-life bal­ance is some­thing the Gov­ern­ment should help to man­age.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the re­al­ity is that many lo­cal em­ploy­ers still ex­pect their em­ploy­ees to re­main con­tactable and an­swer­able to them at all times.</p>
    <p>If work-life bal­ance is to be bet­ter man­aged, it is clear that ac­tions more con­crete than non-bind­ing ad­vi­sories are called for.</p>
