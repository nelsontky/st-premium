    <p>Lower- to mid­dle-in­come work­ers who have been hit hard by the on­go­ing coro­n­avirus pan­demic will re­ceive ex­tra help from next year un­der a scheme an­nounced yes­ter­day. The Covid-19 Re­cov­ery Grant will also cush­ion the im­pact of other fi­nan­cial sup­port schemes draw­ing to a close by the end of this year.</p>
    <p>Lower- to mid­dle-in­come work­ers who have been hit hard by the on­go­ing pan­demic will get ex­tra help from next year un­der a scheme an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 Re­cov­ery Grant (CRG) will also cush­ion the im­pact from other fi­nan­cial sup­port schemes draw­ing to a close by the end of this year. Mean­while, cab­bies will get help through the new Covid-19 Driver Re­lief Fund.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment (MSF) noted that some peo­ple re­main “sig­nif­i­cantly af­fected” by job or in­come losses as the pan­demic wears on. Tar­geted sup­port will there­fore be given to this group through the CRG, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>The new grant is dif­fer­ent from the ex­ist­ing Covid-19 Sup­port Grant or Self-Em­ployed Per­son In­come Re­lief Scheme (Sirs), both of which are com­ing to an end. Ap­pli­ca­tions for the Covid-19 Sup­port Grant will close by Dec 31, while Sirs will lapse by the year end.</p>
    <p>Un­der the new grant, two groups of peo­ple will be able to get up to $700 a month for three months.</p>
    <p>These are peo­ple who are un­em­ployed – ei­ther on ac­count of re­trench­ment or be­cause their con­tracts were ter­mi­nated – or those who have been placed on in­vol­un­tary no-pay leave for at least three con­sec­u­tive months.</p>
    <p>Other groups will get up to $500 a month for three months un­der the CRG. These are:</p>
    <p>• Em­ploy­ees who are fac­ing salary losses of at least 50 per cent on av­er­age for at least three con­sec­u­tive months; and</p>
    <p>• Self-em­ployed peo­ple fac­ing an av­er­age loss in net trade in­come (NTI) of at least 50 per cent over a pe­riod of at least three con­sec­u­tive months, com­pared with their av­er­age monthly NTI last year or this year.</p>
    <p>All these losses must have oc­curred af­ter Jan 23, when the first case of Covid-19 was found in Sin­ga­pore. The ap­pli­cants must still be suf­fer­ing such losses at the point of ap­pli­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>In its state­ment, MSF said the grant is aimed at peo­ple with a lower house­hold in­come, as well as those who have suf­fered more sig­nif­i­cant in­come losses.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­cants must have had a gross monthly house­hold in­come of $7,800 or less, or a monthly per capita in­come of $2,600 or less be­fore be­ing af­fected by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>They should have been eco­nom­i­cally ac­tive be­fore the pan­demic hit Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>To qual­ify for the grant, ap­pli­cants will also need to show proof that they have been search­ing for jobs or seek­ing to up­grade their skills through gov­ern­ment-linked por­tals, at­tend­ing job in­ter­views, or par­tic­i­pat­ing in ca­reer coach­ing at spe­cific gov­ern­ment-linked ca­reer cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Land Trans­port</p>
    <p>Au­thor­ity, which an­nounced a new $133 mil­lion re­lief fund for taxi and pri­vate-hire car driv­ers, noted that rid­er­ship in this sec­tor re­mains muted and fares per trip tend to be lower as a re­sult of shorter com­mutes.</p>
    <p>The new fund, which will give driv­ers $600 per ve­hi­cle ev­ery month be­tween Jan­uary and March, is meant to help with this, it said. The pay­out will be re­duced to $450 a month be­tween April and June.</p>
    <p>Its new scheme re­places the ex­ist­ing Spe­cial Re­lief Fund, through which driv­ers have been get­ting pay­outs since Fe­bru­ary. About 52,000 driv­ers el­i­gi­ble for the Spe­cial Re­lief Fund will au­to­mat­i­cally qual­ify for the new fund.</p>
    <p>How­ever, driv­ers who get pay­outs un­der the Covid-19 Driver Re­lief Fund will not be el­i­gi­ble for the Covid-19 Re­cov­ery Grant.</p>
    <p>Nearly 200,000 peo­ple have ben­e­fited from the Self-Em­ployed Per­son In­come Re­lief Scheme (Sirs), with around $1.8 bil­lion paid out be­tween April and this month, said the Man­power Min­istry and Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>More than half the ben­e­fi­cia­ries were au­to­mat­i­cally el­i­gi­ble for the scheme, while the rest suc­cess­fully ap­plied for it.</p>
    <p>NTUC ex­er­cised flex­i­bil­ity in as­sess­ing qual­i­fy­ing cri­te­ria for Sirs, mean­ing roughly seven in 10 ap­pli­ca­tions pro­cessed by the or­gan­i­sa­tion were ap­proved, they added.</p>
    <p>“The ap­pli­ca­tions which were not ap­proved in­volved ap­pli­cants earn­ing much higher in­comes, re­sid­ing in high-value prop­er­ties or own­ing two or more prop­er­ties with their spouses,” they noted. “Some could not pro­vide ev­i­dence that they were self-em­ployed.”</p>
    <p>Sirs pay­outs will stop by the end of this month. How­ever, the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment (MSF) will roll out a new Covid-19 Re­cov­ery Grant to help em­ploy­ees and self-em­ployed peo­ple who still re­quire fi­nan­cial aid.</p>
    <p>The grant, an­nounced yes­ter­day, is aimed at peo­ple with l ower house­hold in­come, as well as those who have suf­fered more sig­nif­i­cant in­come losses.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­cants must have had a gross monthly house­hold i ncome of $7,800 or less, or a monthly per capita in­come of $2,600 or less be­fore be­ing af­fected by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>They should have been eco­nom­i­cally ac­tive prior to the on­set of the pan­demic. For em­ploy­ees, this means they should have worked for at least six months cu­mu­la­tively be­tween Jan­uary last year and De­cem­ber this year. Mean­while, self-em­ployed peo­ple should have de­clared their net trade in­come last year or this year.</p>
    <p>To qual­ify for the grant, ap­pli­cants also need to prove they have been search­ing for jobs or seek­ing to up­grade their skills through gov­ern­ment-linked por­tals, at­tend­ing job in­ter­views, or par­tic­i­pat­ing in ca­reer coach­ing at spe­cific gov­ern­ment-linked ca­reer cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Self-em­ployed peo­ple may also sub­mit sup­port­ing ev­i­dence of two at­tempts to reach out to clients or busi­nesses in the two months be­fore ap­ply­ing for the new grant.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple can ap­ply for the grant on MSF’s web­site from 9am to 10pm daily, start­ing from Jan 18.</p>
    <p>“There is no need to rush to ap­ply,” said MSF in a state­ment. “Ap­pli­cants should pre­pare their sup­port­ing doc­u­ments in ad­vance for a smooth ap­pli­ca­tion process.”</p>
    <p>Tampines GRC MP Des­mond Choo, who heads the Gov­ern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee for Man­power, said the new grant will serve as a safety net for work­ers in in­dus­tries that have yet to re­turn to their pre-coro­n­avirus per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>“Many work­ers still ex­pe­ri­ence wage re­duc­tion or have yet to re­turn to the work­force,” he added. “We are see­ing signs of in­creased hir­ing but it is early days.”</p>
    <p>Labour econ­o­mist Wal­ter Th­e­seira noted the quan­tum of fund­ing given out un­der the new scheme is sim­i­lar to that given out un­der ComCare. It is worth ask­ing, he added, whether this amount is suf­fi­cient to pro­vide sup­port for an af­fected fam­ily, al­low­ing them to main­tain their pre-pan­demic stan­dard of liv­ing.</p>
    <p>To make ends meet with the cur­rent amount of cash sup­port given, some fam­i­lies will have to go into debt, while oth­ers may have to make cuts in their stan­dard of liv­ing which could im­pact longert­erm re­silience, he said.</p>
    <p>“I do hope that a more com­pre­hen­sive re­view of unem­ploy­ment in­come sup­port schemes is taken soon, l earn­ing from what has worked from our in­come sup­port pro­grammes dur­ing the cri­sis, and what gaps ex­ist still.”</p>
