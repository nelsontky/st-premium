    <p>Ms Lin Yinghui be­gins her work day with a bi­cy­cle ride to the of­fice, a short jour­ney across two in­ter­sec­tions that takes about 10 min­utes. Af­ter work, she cy­cles home.</p>
    <p>The 25-year-old sales ex­ec­u­tive used to com­mute by bus or taxi. But wor­ried about plac­ing her­self at higher risk of con­tract­ing Covid-19, she has switched to us­ing a shared bi­cy­cle.</p>
    <p>The colour­ful two-wheelers are an ubiq­ui­tous sight in Xianyang, in cen­tral Shaanxi prov­ince, where she lives, and else­where in China.</p>
    <p>Ms Lin is one of many Chi­nese pro­fes­sion­als who have switched to more per­sonal modes of trans­port dur­ing the pan­demic, which some ob­servers say could per­sist as a trend, as the coun­try tran­si­tions into a post-Covid-19 fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing the pan­demic, I wanted to choose a mode of travel that would re­duce my risk of in­fec­tion, but af­ter cycling for a while, I re­alised it’s ac­tu­ally quite con­ve­nient. I can leave when­ever I want and it’s also a form of ex­er­cise,” she said.</p>
    <p>Other com­muters, like 35-yearold doc­tor Tang Yao, have also cut down on tak­ing taxis and us­ing ride-hail­ing ser­vices.</p>
    <p>“I feel like the space in­side the car is quite small so there’s a risk of in­fec­tion,” said Dr Tang.</p>
    <p>He takes the sub­way – he wears a mask when on board the train – and rides a shared bi­cy­cle to his work­place each day.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the height of the pan­demic in China, shared bi­cy­cle ser­vices of­fered by com­pa­nies such as Meituan and Hel­lobike were touted by the Chi­nese Cen­tre for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion as the mode of trans­port with the low­est risk of Covid-19 in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>These firms have seen a steady rise in both the fre­quency and length of trips taken by users.</p>
    <p>A Trans­port Min­istry of­fi­cial said the av­er­age dis­tance trav­elled per trip by shared bi­cy­cle has dou­bled to 3km to 3.7km, from 1.4km to 1.7km be­fore the pan­demic, ac­cord­ing to Chi­nese me­dia out­let Cai­jing in July.</p>
    <p>Pri­vate car use has also seen sig­nif­i­cant growth.</p>
    <p>Sta­tis­tics from the China As­so­ci­a­tion of Au­to­mo­bile Man­u­fac­tur­ers show that ve­hi­cle sales have risen for five straight months. Last month, they in­creased 11.3 per cent from a year ear­lier to 2.18 mil­lion units, ac­cord­ing to pre­lim­i­nary fig­ures re­leased by the as­so­ci­a­tion last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>How­ever, sub­way rid­er­ship in Chi­nese cities has not re­cov­ered to pre-pan­demic lev­els.</p>
    <p>The China As­so­ci­a­tion of Met­ros said in a re­cent re­port that pas­sen­ger vol­ume in June in 37 main­land cities was more than 25 per cent lower than a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>In a study of how Covid-19 will af­fect ur­ban mo­bil­ity, which was pub­lished in June, the Bos­ton Con­sult­ing Group said Chi­nese re­spon­dents of their survey con­ducted in China, the United States and West­ern Europe, dis­played a “stronger ten­dency” to rely less on pub­lic tran­sit and ser­vices like ride-hail­ing.</p>
    <p>In­stead, they were drawn to “low­est-risk” modes of trans­porta­tion such as walk­ing, cycling and driv­ing their own cars.</p>
    <p>About 60 per cent of Chi­nese sur­veyed said they were more likely to buy a car post-lock­down com­pared with be­fore the pan­demic, cit­ing rea­sons such as low car own­er­ship rates and cars be­ing seen as a “safe form of trans­porta­tion”.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing Jiao­tong Univer­sity’s trans­port an­a­lyst Zhao Jian said that while com­muters have shown a pref­er­ence for modes of trans­port with a low in­fec­tion risk in the past months, it was still too early to tell if these trends will have a last­ing im­pact in post-pan­demic China.</p>
    <p>“We are still in the pan­demic re­cov­ery phase. But the fig­ures we will see in the weeks ahead as schools re­open will be a very im­por­tant in­di­ca­tion (of fu­ture trends),” he said.</p>
