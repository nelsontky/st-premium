    <p>Be­neath Ms Beatrice Yeo’s pro­fes­sional de­meanour lies a feisty fire­brand lawyer, unafraid of paving her own path in the le­gal in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>That was how she re­ceived pres­ti­gious law awards and ac­co­lades as a young lawyer and was recog­nised as a ris­ing star of fam­ily law early in her ca­reer.</p>
    <p>Now, at 40, Ms Yeo re­counts her ex­pe­ri­ences as a rookie lawyer of head­ing to clients’ homes “to stop vi­o­lence from hap­pen­ing, or find shel­ter for my clients and their chil­dren”, and even tak­ing them to the hos­pi­tal or po­lice sta­tion if they needed help. “I was so pas­sion­ate about di­vorce and fam­ily law,” she says.</p>
    <p>While her clients were ap­pre­cia­tive, the op­pos­ing par­ties were not. How­ever, that never stopped her from stand­ing up for jus­tice and go­ing out of her way to help her clients.</p>
    <p>The same drive in­spired her to set up law firm Yeo & As­so­ciates LLC in 2009, spe­cial­is­ing in mat­ri­mo­nial and di­vorce law. The firm’s growth has been ex­po­nen­tial — it now has 10 spe­cial­ist fam­ily lawyers and eight legally-trained le­gal man­agers.</p>
    <p>With a ded­i­cated team hand­picked by Ms Yeo, the firm has con­sis­tently won awards in the best fam­ily lawyer cat­e­gory, and has been named a top Sin­ga­pore di­vorce law firm more than 20 times.</p>
    <p>Cham­pion of her cause</p>
    <p>The man­ag­ing di­rec­tor, who has han­dled more than 20,000 di­vorce cases to date, be­lieves she is a pi­o­neer in cham­pi­oning fixed costs for di­vorce cases in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>She says: “Fam­ily law needs to be charged on a fixed costs struc­ture, in­stead of an hourly charge which com­mer­cial lawyers usu­ally do.”</p>
    <p>This cost struc­ture gives her clients the con­fi­dence to go through the le­gal process to achieve jus­tice and fair­ness, with­out wor­ry­ing about hourly fees. She notes that with her “fixed costs struc­ture”, the firm has been able to en­joy phe­nom­e­nal growth in size and clien­tele, mainly through word of mouth.</p>
    <p>Yeo & As­so­ciates LLC also con­stantly iden­ti­fies new ways of as­sist­ing clients. It in­vested a six-fig­ure sum to set up por­tal di­vorce­bu­reau.com.sg in 2018, which helps clients com­plete di­vorce ap­pli­ca­tions in the com­fort of their homes in 30 min­utes or less.</p>
    <p>The por­tal, which took two years to de­velop, brings in at least 50 cases a month. Us­ing tech­nol­ogy also saves time and costs, adds Ms Yeo.</p>
    <p>Putting clients first</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, the por­tal ties in with the firm’s goal of en­cour­ag­ing clients to resolve their mar­i­tal dis­putes am­i­ca­bly. Clients who are on talk­ing terms are en­cour­aged to ne­go­ti­ate and dis­cuss mat­ters be­fore reach­ing an agree­ment for an un­con­tested di­vorce, in­stead of hav­ing to in­cur ex­ces­sive le­gal fees.</p>
    <p>Ms Yeo notes: “If there is a chance of set­tling mar­riage in a friendly man­ner, es­pe­cially where the cou­ple can still com­mu­ni­cate with each other, there is no rea­son to come to lawyers to file for a di­vorce. But if clients need le­gal ad­vice be­fore they pro­ceed, they should ap­proach us.”</p>
    <p>The por­tal pro­vides tem­plates with terms and word­ing “painstak­ingly for­mu­lated through my years of ex­pe­ri­ence, and are what the court would ac­cept”.</p>
    <p>To­day, she has cho­sen to fo­cus on groom­ing younger lawyers with her wealth of ex­pe­ri­ence, although she still has a burn­ing de­sire to han­dle dif­fi­cult sit­u­a­tions and take on com­pli­cated cases.</p>
    <p>Ms Yeo re­calls her le­gal jour­ney: “It took me many years to de­velop the nec­es­sary skills to be equipped to han­dle all facets of fam­ily is­sues and dis­putes, and to ad­vance my clients’ case in the best for­mat pos­si­ble.”</p>
