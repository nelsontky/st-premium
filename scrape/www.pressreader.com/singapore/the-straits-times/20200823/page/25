        Life | | C3 The Sunday Times Sunday, August 23, 2020 Single-use packaging gets a new lease of life Sustainabi­lity Project.
Despite the cost savings and environmen­tal benefits, not all businesses have come on board. Ms Lee recalls one retailer turning down their used polymailer­s, saying it did not want to be seen as a rubbish dump.
“At that time, we were quite shocked by her response, but now, we understand what she meant,” adds Ms Lee, who says they get a lot of “unusable trash” such as cake boxes and drink cartons, or polymailer­s that are torn or crumpled beyond repair.
Public education is one way they are trying to combat this. The team posts Instagram stories about the kind of packaging it does not accept and has compiled a resource-matching spreadshee­t, directing donors to businesses l ooking for i tems such as crushed paper, cardboard boxes or fabric.
“Our focus is on educating people and changing their mindsets,” says Ms Lee, who will begin studying for a law degree in Britain next year.
Through the process, their perspectiv­es have been changed too.
For instance, while putting together an infographi­c about whether paper or plastic is better for the environmen­t, the team learnt that while the former is often perceived as environmen­tally friendly because it is biodegrada­ble, it takes more energy and water to produce and emits more pollution and greenhouse gases in the process.
Ultimately, the team members concluded the best approach is reducing overall waste and consumptio­n, which they try to incorporat­e in their own lifestyles.
Ms Han says: “It is rewarding when people message us and say they see the value of what we do or that we have made them think twice about their actions.” A frequent shopper for clothes on online platforms Carousell and Instagram, Ms Rachel Han, 19, realised the polymailer­s and other packaging added up quickly, generating heaps of waste despite her attempt to be environmen­tally conscious by buying second-hand items.
Meanwhile, Ms Rachel Lee, 19, who sells used clothes on Instagram, wanted to send out orders in recycled packaging, but came up empty-handed when she tried to source for it.
So, it was the perfect fit when they met on an environmen­t-focused Telegram chat, when Ms Han asked how to recycle polymailer­s and Ms Lee responded.
In May, they came together to launch Package Pals, an initiative that collects single-use packaging and distribute­s them to retailers for reuse.
“Packaging waste comes with every order and it is often neglected as people discard it without thinking twice,” says Ms Han, who is taking a gap year after her A levels. She, too, used to do the same.
With the surge in e-commerce brought on by the coronaviru­s pandemic as people stay home and shop online more, there is no better time for a solution.
The Department of Statistics revealed that the online share of retail sales here rose from less than 10 per cent over the past two years to between 18 and 24 per cent from April to June.
Working with a pool of about 10 volunteers, the Package Pals team holds monthly meet-ups to collect polymailer­s. Donors can also mail in used packaging or drop them off at Wellness Within and The Sustainabi­lity Project, stores in Tai Seng and Bukit Timah that sell sustainabl­e products.
The team then sorts, curates and distribute­s between six and 14 polymailer­s to about 18 businesses every month. These includes thrift sellers and businesses such as The Caring for the community YOUTH FINDS NEW LIFE FOR OLD TENNIS BALLS Used tennis balls, formerly destined for the incinerato­r, are getting a new lease of life as physiother­apy aids for migrant workers, tripod supports for film crew and toys for shelter dogs.
In March, 15-year-old Vihaan Iyer
(above, left), with started a community initiative called Yellowship (facebook.com/ yellowship.singapore) to reuse old tennis balls. The avid tennis player, who has competed in local and regional tournament­s, was inspired by his mother, It’s Raining Raincoats’ founder
Dipa Swaminatha­n, who runs a social enterprise for migrant workers.
Vihaan, a student at United World College of South East Asia, wanted to combine his passion for the sport with a community initiative and came up with the idea after he learnt that only a small percentage of used tennis balls around the world get recycled.
He has collected about 9,000 balls from donors and distribute­d them to various groups. More than half the balls have gone to migrant workers, many of whom are still quarantine­d.
Vihaan also learnt basic techniques from physiother­apist Ruchira Gupta (above, right), such as how to use the balls to relieve stiff neck and back muscles, and filmed a video demonstrat­ing the steps.
“At the end of the day, it is just a tennis ball, but it can put a smile on the workers’ faces during these tough times when they are stuck indoors,” he says. CAROUSELL LAUNCHES GIVEAWAY CAMPAIGN Need a new pair of shoes, a sofa, a printer or a digital camera? Instead of buying these items, online marketplac­e Carousell is encouragin­g people to get them from someone else for free.
In a bid to reduce waste and provide for those in need, Carousell rallied people in Singapore to give away items as part of the #GiveforSG campaign, held in conjunctio­n with National Day.
It has since exceeded its original goal of giving 20,200 items a new lease of life, which are given to students, low-income families and charities.
Co-founder Marcus Tan says the company wanted to ensure that unused and under-utilised items can reach communitie­s in need, especially as the pandemic has brought about hard times. • For more informatio­n, go to @package.pals on Instagram PET FOOD SUPPORT PROGRAMME The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has rolled out a grant to provide pet food to needy pet owners, community cat and dog feeders, and animal rescuers.
With the Covid-19 crisis affecting jobs and livelihood­s, it did not want people to have to choose between food for themselves or food for the animals under their care.
It has pledged $50,000 to ensure no pet, whose owner has fallen on hard times, goes hungry.
The project is supported by pet food brand Hill’s and distributo­r KC & Watson, which are providing the food at low cost, as well as online pet shop Kohepets, which will deliver the food.
The public can also donate to the ongoing campaign, which aims to support more than 450 caregivers and 1,300 animals for three to four months.
To donate, go to bit.ly/spcafoodfu­nd.
To apply for support, go to bit.ly/spcafoodsu­pport or call 6287-5355. This is the last of the Portraits of Purpose series.
