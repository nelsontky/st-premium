    <p>For an as­so­ci­a­tion that is so big, has so many af­fil­i­ate mem­bers (70) and has 20,000 (reg­is­tered) prac­ti­tion­ers, there is so much that can be achieved.</p>
    <p>ED­WIN LEE, new STF pres­i­dent, who is up­beat on the sport’s prospects.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Taek­wondo Fed­er­a­tion (STF) has courted plenty of neg­a­tive head­lines over the last two years be­cause of res­ig­na­tions, sus­pen­sions and law­suits. But a new man­age­ment com­mit­tee, voted in on Sept 26, has been work­ing hard to re­store the stand­ing of the national sports as­so­ci­a­tion (NSA).</p>
    <p>STF’s new pres­i­dent, vet­eran sports ad­min­is­tra­tor Ed­win Lee, told The Straits Times that his team’s top pri­or­ity was to re­in­state its af­fil­i­ate sta­tus with the Sin­ga­pore National Olympic Coun­cil (SNOC) and World Taek­wondo (WT), the sport’s gov­ern­ing body.</p>
    <p>STF’s sta­tus with both bod­ies was sus­pended in May last year, af­ter WT cited con­cerns over de­vel­op­ments at the STF fol­low­ing the mass res­ig­na­tion of seven STF man­age­ment com­mit­tee mem­bers in Oc­to­ber 2018, and how the mat­ter was han­dled.</p>
    <p>Lee, who had led the Sin­ga­pore Ten­nis As­so­ci­a­tion pre­vi­ously and was a part of the lead­er­ship at the Sin­ga­pore Ta­ble Ten­nis As­so­ci­a­tion, said: “I’ve worked with Mi­lan (Kwee, for­mer STF pres­i­dent) be­fore… and it is sad to see the fed­er­a­tion, which has such good po­ten­tial, get sus­pended be­cause of gov­er­nance is­sues.</p>
    <p>“For an as­so­ci­a­tion that is so big, has so many af­fil­i­ate mem­bers (70) and has 20,000 (reg­is­tered) prac­ti­tion­ers, there is so much that can be achieved.”</p>
    <p>The 65-year-old, one of four new faces in the nine-strong com­mit­tee, said his role was to con­tinue the work that was started by some of his col­leagues who had served in the pre­vi­ous ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Among them are STF sec­re­tary­gen­eral Lai Han Seng, who has served in the as­so­ci­a­tion since 2011 and as­sumed his cur­rent role af­ter it was sus­pended.</p>
    <p>Lai, 44, told ST that the key re­quire­ment for the STF’s sus­pen­sion to be lifted by the SNOC and WT was broadly re­lated to re­view­ing the ar­eas of gov­er­nance and high per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>“Since STF was sus­pended in May 2019, the pre­vi­ous com­mit­tee has worked hard on the rec­om­men­da­tions by SNOC which the new board has taken over,” he said.</p>
    <p>“These in­clude demo­cratic elec­tions based on the new con­sti­tu­tion, which was ap­proved by mem­bers in late 2019, im­proved trans­parency in gov­er­nance, and im­prov­ing the high per­for­mance ecosys­tem.”</p>
    <p>Lee has taken a hands-on ap­proach to tack­ling the lat­ter, chair­ing a high per­for­mance sub-com­mit­tee which has al­ready held sev­eral di­a­logue ses­sions with var­i­ous stake­hold­ers in­clud­ing national ath­letes.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to com­ing up with a multi-year sports plan, which if ap­proved by national sports agency Sport Sin­ga­pore means fund­ing for NSAs’ high per­for­mance plans for be­tween two and four years, the com­mit­tee also in­tends to hire a tech­ni­cal di­rec­tor, high per­for­mance di­rec­tor and “many other coaches, both lo­cal and over­seas”, he said.</p>
    <p>STF has started draw­ing up a short­list which in­cludes in­di­vid­u­als from South Korea, France and Iran although no hires have been made yet, added Lee.</p>
    <p>Apart from beef­ing up the tech­ni­cal ex­per­tise within the STF, Lai said a re­view of the daily train­ing en­vi­ron­ment for its ath­letes would be done.</p>
    <p>With one eye on next year’s SEA Games in Viet­nam, it hopes to dou­ble the cur­rent five train­ing ses­sions a week for the national ath­letes, start­ing next month. At last year’s edi­tion of the bi­en­nial Games in the Philip­pines, the team of seven re­turned with one sil­ver medal, cour­tesy of Ng Ming Wei.</p>
    <p>That may re­quire the sus­pen­sion to be lifted, and Lai said that while the STF’s board has set an in­ter­nal tar­get, it is up to WT and the SNOC to de­cide when that will be.</p>
    <p>Lee re­mains hope­ful.</p>
    <p>“Han Seng and the pre­vi­ous com­mit­tee have been work­ing for al­most two years al­ready, and we’ve been in touch with the SNOC,” he said. “So we hope (the sus­pen­sion will be lifted) quite soon.”</p>
    <p>WE’RE GET­TING THERE</p>
    <p>Since STF was sus­pended in May 2019, the pre­vi­ous com­mit­tee has worked hard on the rec­om­men­da­tions by SNOC which the new board has taken over.</p>
