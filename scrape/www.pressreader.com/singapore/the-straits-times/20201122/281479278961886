    <p>In this six-part se­ries, The Sun­day Times, in part­ner­ship with DBS, delves into Sin­ga­pore’s grow­ing food waste prob­lem and its cost to fam­i­lies, busi­nesses and the en­vi­ron­ment. Vanessa Liu and Judith Tan kick off the se­ries with find­ings from a new sur­vey on com­mu­nity aware­ness of the is­sue and speak to in­dus­try ex­perts and ac­tivists to find out if the coun­try is on the right path to­wards zero food waste.</p>
    <p>Go on, ask your­self: How much money is thrown away through the food waste gen­er­ated by house­holds here ev­ery year?</p>
    <p>The an­swer: $342 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>If you were off the mark, well, you are not alone. Fewer than one in six got it right – just 16 per cent of re­spon­dents – in a Sun­day Times poll of 1,000 res­i­dents, con­ducted by on­line mar­ket re­search firm Milieu In­sight last month.</p>
    <p>All other re­spon­dents un­der­es­ti­mated the sum. And nearly ev­ery­one said his house­hold threw out only small or “rea­son­able” amounts of food.</p>
    <p>Re­spon­dents were asked 14 mul­ti­ple-choice ques­tions like the dif­fer­ence be­tween “sell by”, “use by” and “best be­fore” dates, and how soon the Se­makau Land­fill would reach ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>Close to half – about 47 per cent – got fewer than seven right.</p>
    <p>The find­ings un­der­pin a six-part se­ries by The Sun­day Times, in part­ner­ship with DBS, to un­der­stand the scale of food waste in Sin­ga­pore, and the ef­forts to tackle it by busi­nesses, com­mu­ni­ties and in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>Com­ment­ing on the sur­vey find­ings, Dr Au­gus­tine Quek, se­nior re­search fel­low at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) depart­ment of chem­i­cal and biomolec­u­lar en­gi­neer­ing, said: “As the sur­vey shows, peo­ple do not be­lieve they waste more food even though they are go­ing to more buf­fets, cater­ing more food than needed when host­ing par­ties, and not tak­ing away un­fin­ished food when eat­ing out.”</p>
    <p>Eat­ing habits need to change in or­der to re­duce food waste but Dr Quek, a for­mer pro­gramme man­ager at NUS En­vi­ron­men­tal Re­search In­sti­tute, warned that so­cial norms like this of­ten take time to change.</p>
    <p>The amount of food waste gen­er­ated across the board yearly climbed steadily for much of the last decade and a half, jump­ing by 45 per cent from 558,900 tonnes in 2007 to 810,000 tonnes in 2017.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it fell to 763,000 tonnes in 2018 and 744,000 tonnes last year.</p>
    <p>Ms Pek Hai Lin, ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of non­profit Zero Waste SG, at­tributes the down­ward trend to com­mu­nity-led food res­cue op­er­a­tions and in­stal­la­tion of eco-di­gesters – ma­chines that turn food waste into use­ful by-prod­ucts – in more malls and build­ings.</p>
    <p>Food waste is a huge prob­lem not just be­cause it adds to Sin­ga­pore’s only land­fill – which is ex­pected to be full by 2035 – but also be­cause of the sig­nif­i­cant amount of re­sources and en­ergy that goes into grow­ing, pro­cess­ing and trans­port­ing food, said Ms Pek.</p>
    <p>She added: “When you throw away a burger, you’re not just throw­ing away the burger. You’re throw­ing away en­ergy, money, time and wa­ter. You’re throw­ing away peo­ple’s ef­fort, blood, sweat and tears.”</p>
    <p>She said a huge part of food waste is gen­er­ated up­stream in the sup­ply chain and comes from im­port ex­cess and cos­metic fil­ter­ing, in which food is thrown out if it has slight im­per­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, fresh black­ber­ries that are larger or smaller than an “ideal” size might be re­jected by sup­pli­ers be­cause they do not fit pack­ag­ing stan­dards.</p>
    <p>Close to one-fifth of im­ported and lo­cally farmed fresh pro­duce is lost along the sup­ply chain ev­ery year, a study last year by the Sin­ga­pore En­vi­ron­ment Coun­cil and con­sul­tancy firm Deloitte Sin­ga­pore found. About 393,000 tonnes of veg­eta­bles, fruits, fish, seafood and eggs are spoilt and dam­aged in the post-har­vest stage, and in stor­age, pack­ag­ing and trans­porta­tion.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the study, food can be wasted through dis­ease or pests in farms and ware­houses, over-im­port­ing, de­fec­tive cold chain man­age­ment, and in­ad­e­quate in­fra­struc­ture to pre­vent spoilage.</p>
    <p>Es­ti­mates by the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) also point to com­mer­cial and in­dus­trial premises – such as food man­u­fac­tur­ers, cater­ers, sup­pli­ers and whole­salers – as be­ing re­spon­si­ble for gen­er­at­ing about 40 per cent of the food waste here.</p>
    <p>But, keen to stem the bleed­ing from their books, some pro­duc­ers are tak­ing steps to tackle the is­sue.</p>
    <p>At egg farm Chew’s Agri­cul­ture</p>
    <p>for ex­am­ple, cracked or soiled eggs, which make up to 10 per cent of some 700,000 eggs pro­duced ev­ery day, are sal­vaged as much as pos­si­ble. Some cracked eggs can be pro­cessed into liq­uid eggs, while eggs dirt­ied by chicken poop are washed and dried be­fore be­ing sold at a cheaper price.</p>
    <p>At Pasir Pan­jang Whole­sale Cen­tre, moun­tains of fruits and veg­eta­bles deemed too ugly or un­suit­able for sale end up in the bin, form­ing be­tween 35 and 50 per cent of the vol­ume of pro­duce han­dled daily.</p>
    <p>But vol­un­teers from en­ti­ties such as Food Res­cue Sengkang and Food Bank Sin­ga­pore ar­rive on dif­fer­ent days to col­lect un­wanted pro­duce that is still ed­i­ble.</p>
    <p>“We res­cue food to re­duce waste and since the vol­ume was way too much, we de­cided to share with neigh­bours, homes and other char­i­ties. Af­ter all, we should feed peo­ple, not bins,” said co-founder of Food Res­cue Sengkang Janet Lee.</p>
    <p>Su­per­mar­kets are dis­cov­er­ing that ef­forts to re­duce food waste go down well with cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>By of­fer­ing re­duced-to-clear pro­mo­tions for slightly blem­ished fruits and veg­eta­bles, and do­nat­ing un­sold canned food and items with dam­aged pack­ag­ing to a food char­ity, FairPrice cut the amount of food dis­carded, from 2,203 tonnes in 2014 to 1,326 tonnes in 2015, and 1,278 tonnes in 2016.</p>
    <p>At the na­tional level, food waste re­cy­cling – which stood at 18 per cent last year – is a key strat­egy in the coun­try’s Zero Waste Master­plan to re­duce the amount of leftovers sent to the Se­makau Land­fill by 30 per cent by 2030.</p>
    <p>By 2024, com­mer­cial and in­dus­trial premises which gen­er­ate large amounts of food waste will have to seg­re­gate the left­over stuff for treat­ment.</p>
    <p>To make a real dent in the prob­lem, ex­perts say an over­haul in the food sup­ply chain is needed, with un­wanted food rein­tro­duced as use­ful by-prod­ucts, and sur­pluses do­nated or sold at a dis­count.</p>
    <p>To al­lay busi­nesses’ con­cerns about be­ing held li­able for any health risk as­so­ci­ated with con­sum­ing do­nated food, MP for Nee Soon GRC and chair­man of the Govern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit</p>
    <p>tee for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Louis Ng is plan­ning to ta­ble a Good Sa­mar­i­tan Food Do­na­tion Act, to pro­vide le­gal pro­tec­tion for com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>But it is just as vi­tal that con­sumers change their be­hav­iour, he added.</p>
    <p>“If (con­sumers) con­tinue to buy and waste as the sur­vey shows, busi­nesses will con­tinue to or­der that much food as well. The idea is to get peo­ple to pre­vent the food waste at the start.”</p>
    <p>Con­sumers may also have to be pre­pared to pay more for lo­cal pro­duce that is fresher and safer, which not only sup­ports do­mes­tic en­ter­prises, but also helps to re­duce the wastage in the im­port process.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is in­ten­si­fy­ing lo­cal pro­duc­tion to meet 30 per cent of its nu­tri­tional needs by 2030, but pro­duc­ers like Mr Ed­vin Lim, direc­tor of Chew’s Agri­cul­ture, worry if de­mand can keep up with the planned in­crease in sup­ply.</p>
    <p>How­ever, food se­cu­rity ex­pert Paul Teng said it is un­likely that lo­cal sup­ply, if af­ford­able, could ex­ceed de­mand, as Sin­ga­pore still im­ports most of its needs.</p>
    <p>Last year, lo­cal farms ac­counted for 26 per cent of eggs, 14 per cent of leafy veg­eta­bles and 10 per cent of fish con­sumed here.</p>
    <p>Taxi driver Yeo Ah Huat feels that peo­ple throw away food with­out think­ing be­cause they are af­flu­ent. “If you’re not well-to-do, you would think it’s a waste,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Ed­u­cat­ing peo­ple will not be easy. You will have to cul­ti­vate such a value of not wast­ing food from young.”</p>
    <p>At the end of the day, con­sumer choices play a huge role in the bat­tle against food waste, said Ms Pek.</p>
    <p>“Con­sumers can do their part by un­der­stand­ing that pro­duce can come in dif­fer­ent shapes and sizes and still be ed­i­ble, and be­ing open­minded to buy­ing pro­duce that might not look a cer­tain way,” she added.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng also noted that it boils down to con­sumer aware­ness and tak­ing ac­tion.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­body feels that it’s just a small part that they play, but taken to­gether, then it be­comes this 700,000 tonnes of food wasted.”</p>
    <p>FEED­ING PEO­PLE, NOT BINS</p>
    <p>We res­cue food to re­duce waste and since the vol­ume was way too much, we de­cided to share with neigh­bours, homes and other char­i­ties. Af­ter all, we should feed peo­ple, not bins.</p>
