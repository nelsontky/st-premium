    <p>WELLING­TON • New Zealand Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern was sworn in for a sec­ond term yes­ter­day, as fi­nal elec­tion re­sults showed her land­slide vic­tory was even big­ger than pre­vi­ously thought.</p>
    <p>The charis­matic leader and her min­is­ters made their oaths of of­fice in English and Maori dur­ing a cer­e­mony at Welling­ton’s Gov­ern­ment House.</p>
    <p>“I would say sim­ply that sit­ting at this ta­ble is Aotearoa New Zealand,” Ms Ardern said, us­ing the Maori term for her coun­try as she ges­tured to her gath­ered team, in which women and Maori are strongly rep­re­sented.</p>
    <p>“They col­lec­tively rep­re­sent a range of dif­fer­ent per­spec­tives, huge tal­ent, enor­mous ex­pe­ri­ence and, as you would ex­pect in any time of cri­sis, a huge com­mit­ment to serv­ing this coun­try.”</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern, 40, lever­aged her suc­cess in bat­tling Covid-19 to re­ceive an un­prece­dented ma­jor­ity at the Oct 17 elec­tion, lead­ing her cen­treleft Labour Party to its big­gest win since World War II.</p>
    <p>Fi­nal re­sults re­leased yes­ter­day showed Ms Ardern won 50 per cent of the vote, up from 49 per cent on elec­tion night, giv­ing her 65 seats in the 120-strong Par­lia­ment, rather than 64.</p>
    <p>The main op­po­si­tion Na­tional Party saw its seats re­duced from 35 to 33, prompt­ing cam­paign di­rec­tor Gerry Brown­lee to step down as deputy party leader.</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern said she had a clear man­date for re­form, al­though her pri­or­i­ties were con­tain­ing Covid-19 and re­build­ing the virus-dam­aged econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic is one of a string of emer­gen­cies that tested Ms Ardern’s lead­er­ship dur­ing a tor­rid first term, af­ter she rode to an un­ex­pected vic­tory in 2017 polls on the back of a wave of sup­port dubbed “Jacinda-ma­nia”.</p>
    <p>She dis­played both em­pa­thy and de­ci­sive ac­tion on gun con­trol af­ter a white su­prem­a­cist gun­man killed 51 Mus­lim wor­ship­pers in the at­tack on two Christchur­ch mosques last year.</p>
    <p>She again found her­self com­fort­ing a shocked na­tion when a vol­canic erup­tion at White Is­land, also known as Whakaari, killed 21 peo­ple and left dozens more with hor­rific burns.</p>
    <p>While praised for her cri­sis man­age­ment, Ms Ardern was crit­i­cised dur­ing her first term for fail­ing to de­liver on key prom­ises such as im­prov­ing hous­ing af­ford­abil­ity, pro­tect­ing the en­vi­ron­ment and re­duc­ing child poverty.</p>
    <p>Since the elec­tion, she has sig­nalled that she wants re­form, but not at a rate that would alien­ate the cen­trist vot­ers who switched sup­port to Labour in the polls.</p>
    <p>“We must make sure we rep­re­sent all those who elected us, be they in city seats, ru­ral seats, gen­eral seats or Maori seats,” she told re­porters yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern had flagged ac­tion on in­fra­struc­ture projects, in­clud­ing in­creased state hous­ing and more re­new­able en­ergy, as well as a de­ter­mi­na­tion to tackle is­sues such as cli­mate change, poverty and in­equal­ity.</p>
    <p>Dr Ed­ward Elder, a teach­ing fel­low spe­cial­is­ing in po­lit­i­cal com­mu­ni­ca­tion at the Univer­sity of Auck­land, said Ms Ardern is likely to take an “in­cre­men­tal­ist” ap­proach to re­form.</p>
    <p>“It re­ally de­pends on what the Labour gov­ern­ment thinks it can im­ple­ment to cre­ate long-term change, rather than over­reach­ing, fac­ing a harsh back­lash, and hav­ing Na­tional come in af­ter 2023 and sim­ply re­vers­ing all their de­ci­sions,” he told Agence FrancePres­se.</p>
