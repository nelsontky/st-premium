    <p>• Manch­ester United and Eng­land leg­end Bobby Charl­ton has been di­ag­nosed with de­men­tia, ac­cord­ing to re­ports yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A Tele­graph re­port said the 83-year-old’s wife Norma had given her “bless­ing” for the con­di­tion to be re­ported.</p>
    <p>In July, Charl­ton’s brother Jack died, hav­ing pre­vi­ously been di­ag­nosed with de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment of Bobby’s ill­ness comes two days af­ter Charl­ton’s for­mer United and Eng­land team­mate Nobby Stiles died aged 78 af­ter a long ill­ness.</p>
    <p>The trio were mem­bers of Eng­land’s 1966 World Cup-win­ning team.</p>
    <p>Bobby is re­garded as one of Eng­land’s best-ever mid­field­ers and is an icon at Old Traf­ford. He was of­ten pre­sent dur­ing United’s home games be­fore the coron­avirus pan­demic struck. He had held Eng­land’s goal-scor­ing record of 49 for close to 50 years un­til it was bro­ken by for­mer United striker and cap­tain Wayne Rooney.</p>
    <p>Rooney also took Charl­ton’s United record when he passed the 249 goals he scored for the club, tal­ly­ing 253 by the time he left in 2017.</p>
    <p>“Yet an­other hero of our 1966 World Cup win­ning team has been di­ag­nosed with de­men­tia. Per­haps the great­est of them all, @SirBobby. This is both very sad and deeply con­cern­ing,” for­mer Eng­land striker Gary Lineker wrote on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>Charl­ton’s 249 United goals came across 758 games for the club, with his Eng­land goals com­ing in 106 ap­pear­ances.</p>
    <p>A sur­vivor of the Mu­nich Dis­as­ter in 1958 that killed sev­eral United play­ers in a plane crash, he helped re­vive the team in the wake of the tragedy.</p>
    <p>He fa­mously scored two goals when United beat Ben­fica to win their first Euro­pean Cup in 1968.</p>
    <p>Charl­ton also won three English top-flight ti­tles and the FA Cup with United.</p>
