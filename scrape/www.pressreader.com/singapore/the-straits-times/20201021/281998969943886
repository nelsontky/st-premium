    <p>From next year, pri­mary and sec­ondary school stu­dents here may be taught about the ills of the gam­bling­like el­e­ments, com­monly called loot boxes, that are present in many video games now, es­pe­cially free mo­bile ti­tles.</p>
    <p>This comes even as con­cerns mount that games with such fea­tures could be gain­ing main­stream promi­nence, with large ad­ver­tise­ments for them in MRT sta­tions – such as those for the pop­u­lar mo­bile game Gen­shin Im­pact, which was launched late last month.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) told The Straits Times ear­lier this month that “the dan­gers of loot boxes” will be in­cluded in its cy­ber well­ness ed­u­ca­tion re­sources for stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Th­ese ed­u­ca­tion ma­te­ri­als, as well as those for risks as­so­ci­ated with gam­ing, such as ex­ces­sive gam­ing be­hav­iour, will be part of MOE’s new char­ac­ter and cit­i­zen­ship ed­u­ca­tion cur­ricu­lum next year.</p>
    <p>Loot boxes are vir­tual goodie bags that give play­ers ran­dom in-game re­wards, and can be pur­chased with cur­ren­cies in the game or in­di­rectly with real cash.</p>
    <p>The re­wards may in­clude vir­tual out­fits or weapon up­grades.</p>
    <p>Th­ese boxes are of­ten found in mo­bile games that are free to down­load, as well as in sev­eral games that have an up­front price tag.</p>
    <p>Ex­am­ples in­clude Gen­shin Im­pact and 2017’s Fifa 18.</p>
    <p>How­ever, as the 2021 ed­u­ca­tion re­sources for loot boxes and other gam­ing risks fall un­der ad­di­tional re­sources pro­vided to schools by the min­istry, it will not be com­pul­sory for teach­ers to use them as part of their cy­ber well­ness lessons for stu­dents. Teach­ers can choose to use th­ese ma­te­ri­als in class as they wish.</p>
    <p>Un­like the planned 2021 cur­ricu­lum, the cur­rent char­ac­ter and cit­i­zen­ship ed­u­ca­tion syl­labus from 2014 does not men­tion loot boxes at all.</p>
    <p>Madam Choy Wai Yin, direc­tor of MOE’s guid­ance branch at the stu­dent devel­op­ment cur­ricu­lum di­vi­sion, said that cy­ber well­ness ed­u­ca­tion will fea­ture more strongly in the re­vised char­ac­ter and cit­i­zen­ship ed­u­ca­tion cur­ricu­lum.</p>
    <p>“There will be a greater em­pha­sis on equip­ping stu­dents to recog­nise risks in the dig­i­tal space, iden­tify and dis­cern neg­a­tive in­flu­ences and in­ap­pro­pri­ate web­sites, and man­age ex­ces­sive use of so­cial me­dia,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Through char­ac­ter and cit­i­zen­ship ed­u­ca­tion lessons, our stu­dents are taught the dan­gers of ex­ces­sive gam­ing, gam­bling and other ad­dic­tive be­hav­iours. They are also taught the im­por­tance of ex­er­cis­ing self-con­trol, how to lead bal­anced lives and ex­plore healthy leisure ac­tiv­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>AKIN TO GAM­BLING</p>
    <p>Coun­sel­lors and cy­ber well­ness ex­perts said that while ed­u­ca­tion al­lows both par­ents and younger gamers to make in­formed de­ci­sions about how they con­sume on­line con­tent, loot boxes still pose a dan­ger due to their sim­i­lar­i­ties to gam­bling mech­a­nisms.</p>
    <p>Mr Shawn Soh, a se­nior coun­sel­lor at Touch Youth In­ter­ven­tion, said loot boxes have been linked with prob­lem gam­bling as both in­volve a high de­gree of chance and a “risk-re­ward fac­tor”, sim­i­lar to slot machines in casi­nos.</p>
    <p>Fei Yue Com­mu­nity Ser­vices so­cial worker Yeo Hui Teng noted that be­havioural ad­dic­tions and a per­son’s sus­cep­ti­bil­ity to ad­dic­tions may be com­plex, and play­ing games with loot boxes may give gamers a sense of ex­cite­ment or “rush”.</p>
    <p>Play­ers may then re­quire more “doses” when they get used to the ex­cite­ment from their gam­ing and spend­ing.</p>
    <p>“There is a con­cern that it could lead to the need to spend even more money in-game, or that the gamers might move on to other sim­i­lar ad­dic­tions that might ful­fil that ‘rush’.”</p>
    <p>Coun­sel­lors said loot boxes are at­trac­tive to play­ers for rea­sons such as pro­gress­ing faster in a game or to show off to friends.</p>
    <p>Mr Soh said that “some drops may be con­sid­ered ‘rare’ and con­trib­ute to the il­lu­sion of land­ing a big prize”.</p>
    <p>The odds can re­port­edly be less than 1 per cent.</p>
    <p>HUN­DREDS SPENT</p>
    <p>Mr Chong Ee Jay, a fam­ily life spe­cial­ist and cy­ber well­ness ex­pert at Fo­cus on the Fam­ily Sin­ga­pore, said the thrill of ran­dom sur­prises can lead some gamers to spend large amounts of money.</p>
    <p>A teenager he coun­selled about two years ago spent al­most $500 on loot boxes in the game Over­watch in a month. The then 17-year-old was first at­tracted to the loot boxes as the items he re­ceived from them drew the at­ten­tion of his friends, which he en­joyed. To fund his pur­chases, the teen also lied to his par­ents to re­ceive a big­ger al­lowance.</p>
    <p>The Home Af­fairs and So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment min­istries said games that al­low play­ers to con­vert loot box items to real-world cash or mer­chan­dise are con­sid­ered gam­bling and are pro­hib­ited here. But games lack­ing such meth­ods are not con­sid­ered gam­bling.</p>
    <p>Still, the min­istries ac­knowl­edged that there “may still be con­cerns over gam­ing ad­dic­tion”, adding that pub­lic ed­u­ca­tion is key.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Coun­cil on Prob­lem Gam­bling (NCPG) has been ed­u­cat­ing young peo­ple, par­ents, ed­u­ca­tors and the pub­lic on this.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, from Au­gust to this month, NCPG is rais­ing aware­ness through a cam­paign on stream­ing plat­form Spo­tify to ed­u­cate youth on the dan­gers of loot box gam­bling in games.</p>
    <p>De­spite the ef­forts in schools to ed­u­cate the young on ad­dic­tive el­e­ments in games, Ms Yeo said the onus falls on par­ents to en­sure that th­ese mes­sages are con­sis­tently en­forced at home.</p>
    <p>Mr Soh said par­ents can play with their chil­dren and help them un­der­stand the po­ten­tial dan­gers of loot boxes.</p>
    <p>More could be done as well to pre­vent young chil­dren from buy­ing them un­know­ingly, he added, such as age ver­i­fi­ca­tion for games with loot boxes.</p>
    <p>THE RISK There is a con­cern that it could lead to the need to spend even more money in-game, or that the gamers might move on to other sim­i­lar ad­dic­tions that might ful­fil that ‘rush’.</p>
