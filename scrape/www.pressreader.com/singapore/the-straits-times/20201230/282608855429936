    <p>While most peo­ple lament what a hor­rid year 2020 has been, Hol­ly­wood ac­tor Matthew McConaughe­y (above, right), 51, has in­stead cho­sen to fo­cus on the un­ex­pected gifts the Covid-19 pan­demic has brought him.</p>
    <p>For the past seven months, his 88-year-old mother, Mary</p>
    <p>Kath­leen McCabe (above left), has been liv­ing with him, his wife, Camila Alves (above right), and three chil­dren dur­ing the lock­down.</p>
    <p>“What a year we have just lived through, one like no other,” McConaughe­y says in a sneak peek video for Peace Out 2020, a Face­book Watch year-en­der spe­cial. “One of my themes, the­o­ries and ap­proaches with get­ting through hard times is when faced with the in­evitable, get rel­a­tive.”</p>
    <p>Ter­ri­ble pun aside, he says his mother and his kids have grown closer: “Her be­ing around her grand­kids, her three grand­kids, ev­ery sin­gle day for the last seven months is go­ing to be some­thing that she will never forget.</p>
    <p>“Some­thing that they’ll never forget. Some­thing that has re­ally en­riched their re­la­tion­ship and some­thing that we would not have done un­less we had been quar­an­tined.”</p>
    <p>Alves has in the past few months shared videos and pho­tos on In­sta­gram of her mother-in-law en­joy­ing her time with her fam­ily. As for 2021, the la­conic Os­car win­ner has this to say: “In the mean­time and all of time, let’s re­mem­ber to keep our sense of hu­mour dur­ing this time. It goes a long way.”</p>
    <p>Peace Out 2020, which aired on Face­book Watch yes­ter­day, fea­tured stars such as Anne Hath­away, Arnold Sch­warzeneg­ger, Becky G, Bob Saget and Danny De­Vito.</p>
