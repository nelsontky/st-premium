    <p>Siglap Shop­ping Cen­tre in East Coast Road will be put up for col­lec­tive sale via pub­lic ten­der with a re­serve price of $120 mil­lion, sole mar­ket­ing agent OrangeTee Ad­vi­sory an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The three-storey de­vel­op­ment, with eight com­mer­cial units and eight apart­ments, was com­pleted in 1980 and sits on a site of 39,635 sq ft.</p>
    <p>There is a pos­si­bil­ity that the free­hold site can be com­bined with an ad­join­ing state land plot of 5,005 sq ft to form a larger com­bined par­cel of 44,640 sq ft, sub­ject to ap­proval from the au­thor­i­ties, said OrangeTee.</p>
    <p>The own­ers’ re­serve price trans­lates to a land rate of $1,235 per sq ft per plot ra­tio, af­ter fac­tor­ing in the ad­di­tional 7 per cent bonus res­i­den­tial gross floor area for pri­vate out­door spa­ces and in­clu­sive of an es­ti­mated de­vel­op­ment charge of $47.47 mil­lion and an es­ti­mated “alien­ation cost” of $7.2 mil­lion for the state land plot.</p>
    <p>Mr Ed­mund Lee, ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of OrangeTee Ad­vi­sory, said: “With its free­hold ten­ure and lo­ca­tion in the pop­u­lar Dis­trict 15, the site is likely to see good in­ter­est from de­vel­op­ers. The op­ti­mal site area, cou­pled with a frontage of about 60m onto East Coast Road, of­fers de­vel­op­ers the op­por­tu­nity to build a prominent mixed-use de­vel­op­ment to cater to the life­style de­mands of buy­ers.”</p>
    <p>Siglap Shop­ping Cen­tre is close to a range of ameni­ties such as Be­dok Mall, Park­way Pa­rade and Park­way East Hospi­tal, as well as schools in­clud­ing Vic­to­ria School, St Pa­trick’s School, CHIJ Ka­tong Con­vent and Vic­to­ria Ju­nior Col­lege.</p>
    <p>The site also has easy ac­cess to East Coast Park­way and Pan-Is­land Ex­press­way. It will be within 10 min­utes’ walk of the fu­ture Siglap MRT sta­tion on the new Thom­son-East Coast Line.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay Liam Hiap, direc­tor at OrangeTee Ad­vi­sory, said: “New project sales in the East Coast area have been trend­ing well, and at­test to the con­tin­ued ap­peal of the Siglap/Ka­tong dis­trict, with its plethora of din­ing, shop­ping and recre­ational ameni­ties.”</p>
    <p>Un­der the Gov­ern­ment’s Mas­ter Plan 2019, the site is zoned res­i­den­tial with com­mer­cial on the first storey, along with a gross plot ra­tio of 3.0 and a build­ing height con­trol of four storeys.</p>
    <p>The ten­der for Siglap Shop­ping Cen­tre opens to­day and closes at 3pm on Dec 9.</p>
    <p>There is a pos­si­bil­ity that the free­hold site can be com­bined with an ad­join­ing state land plot of</p>
    <p>5,005 sq ft to form a larger com­bined par­cel of 44,640 sq ft, sub­ject to ap­proval from the au­thor­i­ties, said OrangeTee Ad­vi­sory.</p>
