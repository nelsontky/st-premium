    <p>Sales of com­puter mon­i­tors i n Sin­ga­pore are buck­ing the coro­n­avirus-fu­elled down­turn as con­sumers switch to work­ing at home.</p>
    <p>The surge in com­puter mon­i­tor sales here is a rare bright spot for the con­sumer elec­tron­ics in­dus­try, which has seen sales of big-ticket items such as smart­phones and tele­vi­sions de­cline as con­sumers tighten their belts.</p>
    <p>Mar­ket re­search firm Euromon­i­tor In­ter­na­tional pre­dicts that re­tail sales (ex­clud­ing busi­ness-to-busi­ness, or B2B, sales) of com­puter mon­i­tors here will rise by 4,500 units this year to al­most 50,000 units – a 10 per cent in­crease over that last year. This would also be the high­est sales fig­ure recorded by Euromon­i­tor for mon­i­tors in Sin­ga­pore since 2015.</p>
    <p>A hand­ful of man­u­fac­tur­ers sur­veyed by The Straits Times say their mon­i­tor sales here have risen in the past three months com­pared with the same pe­riod last year. Their growth ranges from 30 per cent to 500 per cent.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the lo­cal mar­ket will dip by 3 per cent this year to around 408,000 units, says mar­ket re­search firm IDC, which tracks both re­tail and B2B mon­i­tor ship­ments. This de­cline is less than its March fore­cast of a drop of 7 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mar­ket re­search firm Om­dia has also read­justed its fore­cast for PC mon­i­tors in the light of the pan­demic. Se­nior prin­ci­pal an­a­lyst Hidetoshi Himuro says around 28.5 mil­lion units were shipped glob­ally in the first quar­ter of this year, a 34 per cent in­crease from an ear­lier fore­cast of 21.3 mil­lion units. He at­tributes this un­ex­pected rise to the work-from-home trend, which is likely to per­sist for a few years un­til a “new nor­mal” is reached.</p>
    <p>Om­dia says global mon­i­tor ship­ments will re­main flat this year at around 0.4 per cent growth to reach around 127 mil­lion mon­i­tors shipped.</p>
    <p>Sales man­ager Ed­win Tan, 46, who bought a gam­ing mon­i­tor dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, says: “Since work from home was im­ple­mented, I have started to use my gam­ing PC for work too. I was al­ready think­ing of get­ting a high re­fresh rate mon­i­tor for first-per­son shooter games and, as a bonus, hav­ing two mon­i­tors def­i­nitely helps with my pro­duc­tiv­ity.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tan picked a 165Hz high re­fresh rate mon­i­tor that en­ables a smoother game­play ex­pe­ri­ence com­pared with stan­dard mon­i­tors that have a 60Hz re­fresh rate.</p>
    <p>GAM­ING MON­I­TORS RISING</p>
    <p>Gam­ing mon­i­tors, while still a niche seg­ment, are grow­ing faster than non-gam­ing mod­els, says Mr Himuro. He es­ti­mates that global ship­ments of gam­ing mon­i­tors this year will in­crease by 41 per cent year on year to reach around 10 mil­lion units.</p>
    <p>The gam­ing mon­i­tor seg­ment has also gen­er­ated buzz, with man­u­fac­tur­ers rac­ing to boost the re­fresh rate of dis­plays. The lat­est mod­els boast a re­fresh rate of up to 360Hz. And it could go higher – Mr Himuro says the hu­man eye can per­ceive re­fresh rates of up to 1,000Hz in some cases.</p>
    <p>Other trend­ing fea­tures to watch are ul­tra-wide mod­els with an as­pect ra­tio of 21:9 (and higher) and USB-C con­nec­tiv­ity, says Mr Bryan Ma, vice-pres­i­dent of de­vices re­search at IDC. Ul­tra-wide mon­i­tors of­fer more hor­i­zon­tal screen real es­tate. This, says Mr Ma, makes users more pro­duc­tive as they can “lay out mul­ti­ple win­dows across one’s screen with­out hav­ing to switch between them or scroll across long spread­sheets”.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing a USB-C port on a mon­i­tor re­duces ca­ble clut­ter for those who own newer thin and light note­books with USB-C or Thun­der­bolt 3 ports. In­stead of re­quir­ing mul­ti­ple cables for power and video, a sin­gle USB-C ca­ble can send video from the lap­top to the mon­i­tor while de­liv­er­ing power from the mon­i­tor to the note­book.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts also point to por­ta­ble mon­i­tors as an up­com­ing trend. Th­ese bat­tery-pow­ered, thin and light mon­i­tors con­nect to note­books and even smart­phones through USB-C. With mod­ern work­ers in­creas­ingly mo­bile, they may find por­ta­ble mon­i­tors that can be car­ried between their homes and their of­fices a use­ful com­puter pe­riph­eral.</p>
