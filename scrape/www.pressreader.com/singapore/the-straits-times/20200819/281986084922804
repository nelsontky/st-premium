    <p>When a fa­mil­iar and com­fort­able sit­u­a­tion changes dra­mat­i­cally, the human in­stinct is to be­lieve that things will soon get back to nor­mal. The idea that life may have changed per­ma­nently is too un­set­tling to deal with. We are see­ing this men­tal­ity with Covid-19. We are also wit­ness­ing it as busi­ness re­sponds to the down­ward spi­ral in US-Chi­nese re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>After 40 years of ever deeper eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion be­tween the United States and China, it is hard to imag­ine a real severance of ties. Many ex­ec­u­tives be­lieve that politi­cians in Wash­ing­ton and Bei­jing will patch up their dif­fer­ences when they re­alise the true im­pli­ca­tions of “de­cou­pling” the world’s two largest economies. The hope is that a trade deal will sta­bilise things, even if it has to wait un­til after the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>But that is too com­pla­cent. The re­al­ity is that de­cou­pling has much fur­ther to go. It is al­ready spread­ing be­yond tech­nol­ogy and into fi­nance. In time, it will af­fect every large in­dus­try, from man­u­fac­tur­ing to con­sumer goods. And all multi­na­tion­als – even those based in Europe – will be af­fected, as they navigate dis­rupted sup­ply chains and changes in Amer­i­can and Chi­nese law.</p>
    <p>This process is be­ing driven by a fun­da­men­tal shift in the way both the US and China see their re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>For the past four decades, busi­ness logic has pre­vailed over strate­gic ri­valry. But we are in a new world in which po­lit­i­cal ri­valry over­rides eco­nomic in­cen­tives – even for a US pres­i­dent who prides him­self on be­ing a deal­maker. When Mr Don­ald Trump was in­formed that his new or­der – forc­ing US com­pa­nies to cut ties with</p>
    <p>WeChat, a Chi­nese mes­sag­ing app – would hurt Amer­i­can sales in China, his re­sponse was, “what­ever”.</p>
    <p>This is not just Trumpian folly. There is now bi­par­ti­san con­sen­sus in Wash­ing­ton to get tough on China, even if it hurts cor­po­rate prof­its. A Bill to force Chi­nese com­pa­nies to delist from US stock ex­changes if they do not open their books to US reg­u­la­tors was passed unan­i­mously by the Se­nate in May.</p>
    <p>In Bei­jing, too, the po­lit­i­cal im­per­a­tive to as­sert sovereignt­y now over­rides the busi­ness in­cen­tive to avoid con­fronta­tion with the US – China’s largest export mar­ket. Since Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping took power in 2012, China has built mil­i­tary bases across the South China Sea, ended the au­ton­omy of Hong Kong and im­pris­oned mil­lions of Uighur Mus­lims in Xin­jiang. Mil­i­tary threats to Tai­wan are be­com­ing more overt.</p>
    <p>Both sides blame the other for start­ing hos­til­i­ties. The Chi­nese point to Mr Trump’s uni­lat­eral im­po­si­tion of tar­iffs. The US re­sponds that Google and Face­book were blocked in China more than a decade be­fore the US took se­ri­ous ac­tion against</p>
    <p>Chi­nese tech com­pa­nies such as Huawei and ByteDance.</p>
    <p>Who­ever fired the first shot, both sides are now locked into a re­tal­ia­tory logic. If the US takes more mea­sures against WeChat and Huawei, Bei­jing is likely to re­spond by fur­ther re­strict­ing US tech com­pa­nies in China.</p>
    <p>As po­lit­i­cal ten­sion mounts, so Amer­i­can con­sumer brands will be vul­ner­a­ble to boy­cotts by a na­tion­al­is­tic Chi­nese pub­lic. That is po­ten­tially bad news for high-pro­file Amer­i­can brands such as Star­bucks and the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Emo­tions aside, de­cou­pling is also driven by new as­sess­ments of risk. The vul­ner­a­bil­ity of Chi­nese com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing ZTE and Huawei, to bans on sales of US com­puter chips has in­ten­si­fied China’s drive to be­come self-suf­fi­cient in key tech­nolo­gies. US com­pa­nies are also hedg­ing their bets. Ap­ple, which has built its busi­ness around man­u­fac­tur­ing in China, is mak­ing its lat­est iPhone in In­dia, as well as China.</p>
    <p>The emerg­ing field of con­flict is bank­ing and fi­nance. Over the past decade, the US has de­ployed fi­nan­cial sanc­tions against coun­tries, in­clud­ing Iran and Venezuela, to of­ten dev­as­tat­ing ef­fect. Now it is be­gin­ning to use this tool in its strug­gle with China.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials in Hong Kong and Xin­jiang have been tar­geted with sanc­tions, in ef­fect shut­ting them out of the US fi­nan­cial sys­tem. Given the cen­tral­ity of the dol­lar to global trade, in­ter­na­tional banks are wary of vi­o­lat­ing these. That risk is man­age­able, while it is con­fined to a few in­di­vid­u­als. But what hap­pens if and when fi­nan­cial sanc­tions are ap­plied to ma­jor Chi­nese com­pa­nies?</p>
    <p>Wall Street banks, which have made a lot of money list­ing</p>
    <p>Chi­nese com­pa­nies in New York, are as­sum­ing that even if fur­ther list­ings are banned, they can bring com­pa­nies to mar­ket in</p>
    <p>Hong Kong. But that would rely on the for­bear­ance of both the Amer­i­can and Chi­nese gov­ern­ments – nei­ther of which can be taken for granted.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean or South-east Asian coun­tries and com­pa­nies are un­likely to be able to stay on the side­lines. The United King­dom’s de­ci­sion to open its 5G tele­coms mar­ket to Huawei – in the teeth of US op­po­si­tion – proved to be un­sus­tain­able. HSBC, which is head­quar­tered in the UK and makes 80 per cent of its prof­its in Asia, has been dragged into the ri­valry through its role in giv­ing ev­i­dence in the US pros­e­cu­tion of Meng Wanzhou, chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer of Huawei.</p>
    <p>Big busi­ness will want to stay neu­tral in the emerg­ing cold war be­tween the US and China. But that may prove im­pos­si­ble. The past 40 years of world his­tory have been built around glob­al­i­sa­tion and the rap­proche­ment be­tween the US and China. But that world is fast dis­ap­pear­ing.</p>
