    <p>Tech­nol­ogy in arts and cul­tural in­sti­tu­tions can be both a bless­ing and a curse, as re­cent ex­am­ples show. There was a mi­nor furore over the lack of Chi­nese-lan­guage cap­tions at the Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore’s Ge­or­gette Chen: At Home In The World. The Gallery did of­fer ad­di­tional Chi­nese-lan­guage in­for­ma­tion via its GalleryEx­plorer app. But to ac­cess it, one needed a smart­phone, an un­der­stand­ing of QR codes and the pa­tience to nav­i­gate the app’s in­ter­face. New tech­nol­ogy might re­duce the need for hard-copy pam­phlets, a way to re­duce con­tact dur­ing a pan­demic, but it may be a bar­rier for older vis­i­tors who are not au fait with dig­i­tal de­mands.</p>
    <p>Yet, tech­nol­ogy can also be a use­ful tool, as the pi­lot scheme at the Na­tional Mu­seum of Sin­ga­pore’s Home, Truly: Grow­ing Up With Sin­ga­pore, 1950s To The Present ex­hi­bi­tion demon­strates. From Jan 21, vis­ually im­paired vis­i­tors can ex­plore the show with the aid of a smart nav­i­ga­tion cane and a com­pan­ion app. Ac­ces­si­bil­ity is be­com­ing a greater is­sue as the pop­u­la­tion ages, and so­ci­ety seeks to be­come more in­clu­sive of dif­fer­ently abled peo­ple. Arts and cul­tural in­sti­tu­tions can lead the way. This is al­ready hap­pen­ing as mu­se­ums and her­itage in­sti­tu­tions are be­ing au­dited for ac­ces­si­bil­ity. Some older mu­se­ums, such as the Changi Chapel And Mu­seum and Re­flec­tions At Bukit Chandu, will be wheelchair­friendly and have bet­ter ameni­ties for peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties when they re­open next year. Mu­se­ums have also in­tro­duced fa­cil­i­ties such as quiet rooms for chil­dren and pro­grammes such as sign lan­guage tours. Theatre groups, too, have be­come con­scious of of­fer­ing op­tions. Such ini­tia­tives are heart­en­ing. No doubt there will be hic­cups along the way as the use of tech­nol­ogy needs to be me­di­ated by good de­sign and con­sid­er­a­tion for the end-user. But open ac­cess is a wor­thy goal to work to­wards.</p>
