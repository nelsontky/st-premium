    <p>The Sun­downer Rooftop farm in trendy Siglap</p>
    <p>There is a sense of raw, do-it-your­self whimsy at The Sun­downer, a lounge-cum-ur­ban farm atop a Siglap shop­house that opened last month.</p>
    <p>To en­ter, guests must pick their way through a shal­low pond that brims with aquatic plants, bal­anc­ing on rocks that wob­ble just a lit­tle.</p>
    <p>Then, there is the rope-and-bas­ket pul­ley sys­tem that owner Clarence Chua de­vised to haul up food de­liv­er­ies and lower bun­dles of Thai and sweet basil from his rooftop gar­den in re­turn.</p>
    <p>Passers-by and pa­trons at the Span­ish restau­rant next door gape. Some­times, when the har­vest is boun­ti­ful, Mr Chua sends down some for them.</p>
    <p>Watch­ing all this from atop feels like be­ing in on a se­cret, the sort of place one chances upon at the rec­om­men­da­tion of his Airbnb host or ho­tel concierge.</p>
    <p>Guests can book the event space for pri­vate gath­er­ings such as movie screen­ings and wed­ding pro­pos­als, or take part in an ex­pe­ri­ence that com­prises hands-on ur­ban farm­ing, getting up close to a bee­hive, honey tast­ing and en­joy­ing farm-to-bar drinks.</p>
    <p>Even the farm’s ex­is­tence is serendip­ity at play. Mr Chua, who is also gen­eral man­ager of land­scap­ing com­pany Coun­try Cousins, found the shop­house in July while look­ing for a place to house five for­eign work­ers.</p>
    <p>He had pre­vi­ously moved his em­ploy­ees out of var­i­ous for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries from March, af­ter the first Covid-19 cases were de­tected there.</p>
    <p>Af­ter shut­tling them around var­i­ous apart­ments over the next few months, in­clud­ing a con­do­minium he owns in Bugis, Mr Chua wanted to set­tle them in more per­ma­nent quar­ters.</p>
    <p>But l and­lords were l eery of rent­ing to for­eign work­ers.</p>
    <p>“The ten­ant pro­file doesn’t fit,” he was told re­peat­edly.</p>
    <p>His cousin, a real es­tate agent, fi­nally found the Siglap shop­house, which Mr Chua de­scribes as “love at first sight”.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond-floor home, where five work­ers now stay, was wellkept. And to his land­scaper’s eye, the empty con­crete roof brimmed with pos­sibil­ity.</p>
    <p>“Ur­ban f arm­ing has be­come pop­u­lar, but I have done only or­na­men­tals so far. I al­ready know how to make plants thrive – it was just a mat­ter of putting in new plants. This was the per­fect chance to ex­per­i­ment,” says Mr Chua, who is mar­ried to a pub­lic ser­vant.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple, both 37, have two sons aged 10 months and 31/ 2.</p>
    <p>Mr Chua had pre­vi­ously built ponds, but not streams, for land­scap­ing clients and took the chance to in­cor­po­rate the lat­ter, fill­ing half of it with plants such as wa­ter hy­acinth and wa­ter let­tuce, and chlo­ri­nat­ing the other half that leads to a chil­dren’s play pool.</p>
    <p>Other ex­per­i­ments proved more haz­ardous.</p>
    <p>While mov­ing a metal shed from a stor­age fa­cil­ity to the rooftop, Mr Chua dis­cov­ered a bee­hive in a cor­ner.</p>
    <p>In­spi­ra­tion struck and the en­to­mophile, whose for­mer pets in­clude scor­pi­ons, taran­tu­las and snakes, de­cided to in­tro­duce bees into his farm.</p>
    <p>He put out a call to land­scap­ing clients, of­fer­ing free re­moval of bees nests if they dis­cov­ered one on their premises, and learnt to re­lo­cate nests from books and YouTube videos.</p>
    <p>In the be­gin­ning, lack­ing pro­tec­tive gear, he was once stung eight times on his face and had to get a steroid in­jec­tion to bring the swelling un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>Bees sting in clus­ters, he ex­plains, as they re­lease a pheromone to warn other bees of dan­ger. The scent, a sac­cha­rine mix of nail pol­ish and ba­nanas, has now be­come a warn­ing for him, too.</p>
    <p>Cloaked safely i n bee suits, vis­i­tors face no such risk.</p>
    <p>From be­hind a net­ted hood, we watch as Mr Chua ex­plains bee be­hav­iour, such as hud­dling to­gether when they sense rain so as to pro­tect the comb, or fan­ning their wings at the en­trance of a hive to reg­u­late the tem­per­a­ture within.</p>
    <p>A honey-tast­ing ses­sion opens our eyes to the tastes, tex­tures and colours of honey from around the world, from the warm, caramel notes of blue gum from Aus­tralia, to the woody and resinous dark am­ber pine honey from the Mediter­ranean.</p>
    <p>We also hear from farm­sca­per Jeremy Beck­man, who, to­gether with Mr Chua, planted rows of Asian herbs such as laksa leaves, Thai basil and kaf­fir lime, as well as more finicky va­ri­eties such as thyme, sage and rose­mary.</p>
    <p>Mr Beck­man, 35, ex­plains what goes into a good pot­ting mix as we layer soil with a bag of com­post he has pre­pared.</p>
    <p>“Good soil should not smell bad,” he says. In­deed the black mix, com­pris­ing waste such as leaf lit­ter and horse ma­nure, is odour­less when I scoop it up with my bare hands.</p>
    <p>Cut­tings of Thai wa­ter­cress, pushed into the soil, take root eas­ily and flour­ish by the kitchen win­dow over the next few weeks with min­i­mal ef­fort.</p>
    <p>We cap the ex­pe­ri­ence with a sam­pling of cock­tails, in­cluded as part of the pack­age.</p>
    <p>A bour­bon smash, gar­nished with cala­mansi and mint and sweet­ened with ste­via in its orig­i­nal plant form, is tangy and re­fresh­ing. And the evening ends on a sul­try note with burnt sage gar­nish­ing Laphroaig whiskey, known for its smoky flavour.</p>
    <p>Other sea­sonal drinks, such as a Bloody Mary when the toma­toes fruit, or a gin and tonic with home­grown cu­cum­ber, are in the pipe­line. Re­gard­less of which plants bear fruit, they will make it work.</p>
    <p>Mr Chua says: “De­spite the pan­demic, or per­haps be­cause of it, The Sun­downer was born. Even in ad­ver­sity, there is al­ways op­por­tu­nity.”</p>
