    <p>Five young men, who quickly helped evac­u­ate cin­ema­go­ers and tended to two in­jured women af­ter a ven­ti­la­tion duct fell from the ceil­ing dur­ing a movie screen­ing, were hon­oured yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Long-time pals Sebastian Koo, Quek Yew Hern, Ed­win Ho, Venkat Ragha­van Gowr­is­hankar and Ju­lian Tay, all aged 19, re­ceived the Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force (SCDF) Com­mu­nity Life­saver Award at Ang Mo Kio Fire Sta­tion.</p>
    <p>The men, for­mer class­mates at St Gabriel’s Sec­ondary School, were watch­ing Tenet at Shaw Theatres at Nex mall when the ven­ti­la­tion duct fell at about 4.45pm on Aug 30.</p>
    <p>“My hands were shak­ing re­ally badly be­cause I was quite shocked about what was hap­pen­ing... but once Sebastian shouted, the rest of us snapped out of our daze,” said Mr Tay, a polytech­nic stu­dent who is in­tern­ing as a jour­nal­ist.</p>
    <p>The other four are full-time na­tional ser­vice­men.</p>
    <p>Mr Koo was the first to call for all movie­go­ers to evac­u­ate. He found the two in­jured women out­side the cinema hall and con­ducted an as­sess­ment for in­juries.</p>
    <p>“I was con­cerned that there were in­juries she might have missed or I might have missed. I was pe­ri­od­i­cally check­ing again and again,” he said. Mr Koo is trained in first aid, hav­ing been part of the Red Cross Youth in sec­ondary school.</p>
    <p>The five men said they were hum­bled and grate­ful to re­ceive the award from Colonel Lim Han Chee, com­man­der of the 3rd SCDF</p>
    <p>Di­vi­sion. Mr Mark Shaw, di­rec­tor at Shaw Or­gan­i­sa­tion, also at­tended the pre­sen­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Venkat, who had called for an am­bu­lance that day, said “I feel we just did what we could in the spur of the mo­ment to help out”.</p>
    <p>Mr Quek said “any­one could have stepped up” and that “it’s our duty to al­ways help peo­ple”.</p>
    <p>Mr Shaw said: “Through their quick think­ing, cinema pa­trons were safely evac­u­ated.</p>
    <p>“Their ac­tions showed the im­por­tance of know­ing what to do in an emer­gency and the dif­fer­ence it could make to save lives.”</p>
    <p>A writ­ten par­lia­men­tary re­ply on Oct 5 said water that had col­lected in an air-con­di­tion­ing and me­chan­i­cal ven­ti­la­tion duct had likely over­loaded sup­port­ing brack­ets and caused it to fall. A Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity in­ves­ti­ga­tion is ex­pected to be com­pleted by the end of this month.</p>
    <p>NO PANIC</p>
