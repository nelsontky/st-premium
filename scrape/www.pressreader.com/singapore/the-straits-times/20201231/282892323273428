    <p>Welsh ac­tor Michael Sheen has re­vealed that he had re­turned his Of­fi­cer of the Or­der of the Bri­tish Em­pire (OBE) award in 2017.</p>
    <p>He ex­plained that it would be hyp­o­crit­i­cal of him not to hand back the royal hon­our he re­ceived in 2009 once he learnt more about the “tor­tured his­tory” his na­tive Wales shared with the Bri­tish state.</p>
    <p>This came up in 2017 as he was pre­par­ing a lec­ture on the sub­ject, he told Guardian colum­nist Owen Jones.</p>
    <p>“By the time I’d fin­ished writ­ing that lec­ture, I re­mem­ber sit­ting there go­ing: ‘Well, I have a choice. I ei­ther don’t give this lec­ture and hold on to my OBE or I give this lec­ture and I have to give my OBE back,’” said the ac­tor. He has ap­peared in movies such as The Queen (2006) and the Good Omens minis­eries (2019) and is also a po­lit­i­cal ac­tivist.</p>
    <p>An OBE is an or­der of the Bri­tish Em­pire, awarded to those who make a great im­pact in their line of work.</p>
    <p>In re­turn­ing the hon­our, Sheen called on the royal fam­ily to end the cen­turies-old prac­tice of hand­ing the ti­tle of Prince of Wales to the heir ap­par­ent to the English throne.</p>
    <p>He re­vealed that he did not pub­li­cise his de­ci­sion at the time and re­served the right to speak about it, but no one had asked him about it un­til now.</p>
    <p>He added: “I didn’t mean any dis­re­spect, but I just re­alised I’d be a hyp­ocrite if I said the things I was go­ing to say in the lec­ture about the na­ture of the re­la­tion­ship be­tween Wales and the Bri­tish state.”</p>
    <p>Peo­ple are al­lowed to re­turn or turn down the award. Other prom­i­nent fig­ures who have done so in­clude au­thor Roald Dahl, mu­si­cians John Len­non and David Bowie, ac­tresses Dawn French and Jen­nifer Saun­ders, and celebrity chef Nigella Law­son.</p>
