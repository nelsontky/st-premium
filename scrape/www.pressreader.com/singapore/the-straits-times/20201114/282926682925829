    <p>CAIRO • With killer mum­mies, a house of hor­rors, slick spe­cial ef­fects and a melan­cholic sound­track, stream­ing gi­ant Net­flix is bank­ing on new block­buster Egyp­tian se­ries Para­nor­mal achiev­ing world­wide suc­cess.</p>
    <p>Billed as a mys­tery and thriller pro­duc­tion based on the best-sell­ing, young-adult fic­tion novel­las of Egyp­tian au­thor Ahmed Khaled Taw­fik, Para­nor­mal was re­leased last week in nine lan­guages to au­di­ences in about 190 coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“With such a huge fan­base, it was a log­i­cal project for us to come on board,” Mr Ahmed Sharkawi, Net­flix’s head of Ara­bic and African orig­i­nal con­tent, said.</p>
    <p>“We’re ex­cited for the fans to see their favourite char­ac­ters – mon­sters and ghosts – com­ing to life.”</p>
    <p>But Para­nor­mal, Net­flix’s first Egyp­tian se­ries, also marks a shift in the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try in Egypt and the wider Arab world.</p>
    <p>Egypt has tra­di­tion­ally been a cul­tural pow­er­house in the re­gion, pro­duc­ing dozens of movies as well as grip­ping drama and com­edy se­ries ev­ery year.</p>
    <p>But af­ter its golden age from the 1940s to 1960s, crit­ics say the film pro­duc­tions had in re­cent years lost its touch.</p>
    <p>Many hope the growth of on­line tele­vi­sion ser­vices could in­ject new life into the in­dus­try – and bring Egypt’s act­ing to a far larger au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>“We are be­gin­ning to see some film-mak­ers by­pass­ing state and pri­vate struc­tures of fi­nanc­ing, and go­ing straight to Net­flix,” said Dr Mar­wan Kraidy, an author­ity on Arab me­dia and dean of North­west­ern Univer­sity in Qatar.</p>
    <p>“This model ap­pears to be gain­ing steam in the Arab world.”</p>
    <p>The new six-episode se­ries of Para­nor­mal, set in the 1960s, fol­lows the ad­ven­tures of Re­faat Is­mail, a haema­tol­o­gist played by Ahmed Amin, who en­coun­ters su­per­nat­u­ral oc­cur­rences.</p>
    <p>Along with his trusty side­kick, Scot­tish sci­en­tist Mag­gie Mackil­lop, played by Bri­tish-Le­banese ac­tress Razane Jam­mal, they solve oc­cult mys­ter­ies, tak­ing them be­yond the splen­dour of Cairo and deep into the Libyan desert.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to create qual­ity con­tent with­out los­ing the Egyp­tian spirit of the work,” said di­rec­tor Amr Salama, a main­stay of in­ter­na­tional film fes­ti­vals with art-house films such as Sheikh Jack­son (2017), as well as episodes of Satur­day Night Live Ara­bia (2016 to present).</p>
    <p>“We didn’t want it to turn out like an Amer­i­can se­ries that’s dubbed in Ara­bic. Even with the spe­cial ef­fects and myths and spooky tales, we wanted them to be au­then­ti­cally Egyp­tian.”</p>
    <p>On so­cial me­dia, Egyp­tian re­cep­tion of Para­nor­mal has been mixed, with many lam­poon­ing the show’s use of spe­cial ef­fects, while oth­ers praised the sub­tle act­ing of lead ac­tor Amin.</p>
    <p>The be­spec­ta­cled, soft-spo­ken ac­tor, who shot to fame in Egypt with his on­line com­edy sketches, spoke ea­gerly about show­cas­ing Egyp­tian tal­ent.</p>
    <p>“My star­ring i n Para­nor­mal comes with the chal­lenge of con­vey­ing Egyp­tian drama to an in­ter­na­tional stage,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It’s a test of see­ing whether we can com­pete and draw au­di­ences be­yond the Arab world.”</p>
    <p>Dr Kraidy likens Net­flix’s en­try into the Arab mar­ket to how the HBO tele­vi­sion net­work in the United States gained trac­tion in house­holds for nu­anced sto­ries in land­mark shows such as The So­pra­nos (1999 to 2007) and The Wire (2002 to 2008).</p>
    <p>“Stream­ing de­vices have fur­ther blurred the bound­aries of what ‘Egyp­tian’ tele­vi­sion drama means,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Kraidy ex­plained how stream­ing ser­vices have cre­ated a savvy mid­dle class of en­ter­tain­ment con­sumers with so­phis­ti­cated tastes.</p>
    <p>“The ma­jor change... is the oblit­er­a­tion of the rhythm of tele­vi­sion con­sump­tion and the frag­men­ta­tion of the watch­ing unit from the fam­ily to the in­di­vid­ual,” he added.</p>
    <p>“Now ev­ery­one watches what they want, when they want... on a bunch of de­vices.”</p>
    <p>The crit­i­cal ac­claim of ArabAmer­i­can ac­tors and sto­ry­tellers in Hol­ly­wood re­cently has also been a con­tribut­ing fac­tor.</p>
    <p>Egyp­tian-Amer­i­can ac­tor Rami Malek won an Os­car for Best Ac­tor last year for his por­trayal of Queen front­man Fred­die Mer­cury in Bo­hemian Rhap­sody (2018).</p>
    <p>Co­me­dian Ramy Youssef’s Hulu se­ries Ramy (2019 to present), fol­low­ing the strug­gles of a young Mus­lim-Amer­i­can keep­ing his faith in a he­do­nis­tic en­vi­ron­ment, also won a Golden Globe award this year.</p>
    <p>Net­flix’s sub­scriber base in the re­gion is just un­der five mil­lion, but the stream­ing site hopes to dou­ble that by 2025 with a slew of Ara­bic con­tent of­fer­ings, in­clud­ing a mu­si­cal by leg­endary Egyp­tian singer Amr Diab later this year.</p>
    <p>Break­out ac­tress Jam­mal hopes Para­nor­mal can ex­pose in­ter­na­tional view­ers to sto­ries be­yond typ­i­cally re­duc­tive Hol­ly­wood stereo­types of Arab char­ac­ters.</p>
    <p>“I hope it puts a spot­light on the tal­ent that we have here,” she said. “I hope that we have more of a chance to bridge the gap be­tween East and West.”</p>
