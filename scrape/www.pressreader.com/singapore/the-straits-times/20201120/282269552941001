    <p>DBS Group Hold­ings’ chief ex­ec­u­tive wel­comes the in­creased reg­u­la­tory scru­tiny of fi­nan­cial tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies in China and else­where in Asia, saying it will cre­ate fairer com­pe­ti­tion with banks that have been sub­ject to stricter over­sight.</p>
    <p>“Over time, you will start get­ting a more level-play­ing field and you’ll start get­ting a pro­por­tion­ate and even reg­u­la­tory re­sponse to all par­tic­i­pants in the mar­ket,” Mr Piyush Gupta said in an in­ter­view with Bloomberg Tele­vi­sion yesterday.</p>
    <p>He spoke af­ter be­ing asked for his view on the shelv­ing of Ant Group’s ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO) in China as reg­u­la­tors seek to level com­pe­ti­tion be­tween fintech giants and tra­di­tional banks.</p>
    <p>Ant and other firms in re­cent years have grown their fi­nan­cial ser­vices on the main­land and be­yond, in­clud­ing in South-east Asia, where DBS is the largest lender.</p>
    <p>“Our view has been in the past that many tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies have been able to ben­e­fit from the ar­bi­trage of not hav­ing the same reg­u­la­tory regime and su­per­vi­sion over­head that banks do,” Mr Gupta said. “And so as we get to that stage, that’s ac­tu­ally help­ful to us.”</p>
    <p>China’s top bank­ing watch­dog is dou­bling down on a push to rein in fi­nan­cial tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies, such as Ant, promis­ing to elim­i­nate mo­nop­o­lis­tic prac­tices and strengthen risk con­trols in the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Ant and other firms, such as Ten­cent Hold­ings, have built dom­i­nant po­si­tions in pay­ments and on­line con­sumer lend­ing over the past decade, free from the over­sight ap­plied to tra­di­tional fi­nan­cial com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese reg­u­la­tors this month out­lined new rules to curb the rapid growth and lever­age at the na­tion’s more than 200 mi­crolen­ders, putting a sur­prise halt to Ant’s US$35 bil­lion (S$47 bil­lion) IPO.</p>
    <p>Ant, along with Ten­cent-backed Sea, has ap­plied for Sin­ga­pore’s dig­i­tal bank­ing li­cences, which could pit them against ma­jor ri­vals such as DBS.</p>
    <p>Over the past decade, Mr Gupta has spent bil­lions of dol­lars up­grad­ing DBS’ tech­nol­ogy and dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion in an­tic­i­pa­tion of grow­ing</p>
    <p>com­pe­ti­tion. “Where we are to­day in our core markets, we are rea­son­ably con­fi­dent that we have what it takes to com­pete,” he said.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s cen­tral bank this week asked DBS’ In­dia unit to take over a cap­i­tal-starved lender in the South Asian na­tion, in a deal that will see DBS In­dia pump in 25 bil­lion ru­pees (S$453 mil­lion) in fresh cap­i­tal in Lak­shmi Vi­las Bank.</p>
    <p>While de­clin­ing to com­ment on the plans due to pend­ing reg­u­la­tory ap­proval, Mr Gupta said the deal will not im­pact DBS’ div­i­dend pay­ment.</p>
    <p>He said that China, In­dia and In­done­sia are key re­gional markets the bank is ex­pand­ing into.</p>
    <p>In China, DBS re­cently got ap­proval to set up a bro­ker­age ven­ture where it can own 51 per cent. The bank will part­ner with “a cou­ple” of local firms, Mr Gupta said, with­out nam­ing them.</p>
    <p>The lender is also grow­ing its pres­ence in the Greater Bay area of south­ern China and Hong Kong, and will tar­get con­sumer fi­nance.</p>
    <p>Like most ma­jor global banks, DBS is also ad­just­ing its poli­cies on workspace and staffing due to the Covid-19 epi­demic. All of DBS’ 29,000 em­ploy­ees will be al­lowed to work re­motely for as much as 40 per cent of the time to ad­dress changes brought upon by the pandemic, the company said this week.</p>
    <p>Asked whether DBS plans to keep all of its of­fice space and staff in all re­gions, Mr Gupta said there will be no re­trench­ment pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>“I’d imag­ine that in the next five to seven years, our over­all real-es­tate foot­print will be a tad smaller than what it is now,” he said.</p>
    <p>With “the reskilling agenda, and then the nat­u­ral at­tri­tion when peo­ple re­tire and move on, I think we will be able to get to the work­force pro­file that we need”.</p>
