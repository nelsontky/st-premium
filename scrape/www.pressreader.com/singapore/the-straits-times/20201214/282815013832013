    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Bri­tish singer FKA Twigs last Fri­day filed a law­suit against Amer­i­can ac­tor Shia LaBeouf, ac­cus­ing him of phys­i­cal and emo­tional abuse dur­ing their year-long re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>The civil law­suit, filed in Los An­ge­les Su­pe­rior Court, seeks un­spec­i­fied dam­ages for al­leged sex­ual bat­tery, as­sault and emo­tional dis­tress. It was filed un­der FKA Twigs’ birth name, Tahliah Bar­nett.</p>
    <p>LaBeouf, 34, dated the 32-yearold be­tween 2018 and last year.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment to The New York Times which broke the story, LaBeouf said: “I’m not i n any po­si­tion to tell any­one how my be­hav­iour made them feel. I have no ex­cuses for my al­co­holism or ag­gres­sion, only ra­tio­nal­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been abu­sive to my­self and ev­ery­one around me for years. I have a his­tory of hurt­ing the peo­ple clos­est to me. I’m ashamed... and am sorry to those I hurt. There is noth­ing else I can re­ally say.”</p>
    <p>Bar­nett met LaBeouf while ap­pear­ing in his semi-au­to­bi­o­graph­i­cal film Honey Boy (2019) about an ac­tor’s dys­func­tional early years.</p>
    <p>The law­suit says LaBeouf “en­gaged in a con­tin­u­ous stream of ver­bal and men­tal abuse to­ward Tahliah, be­lit­tling her and be­rat­ing her af­ter the slight­est per­ceived ‘in­sult’”.</p>
    <p>It said that in Fe­bru­ary last year, he slammed Bar­nett against a car and tried to stran­gle her. She also ac­cuses him of know­ingly giv­ing her a sex­u­ally trans­mit­ted dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Bar­nett’s at­tor­ney Bryan Freed­man said she ini­tially wanted to re­solve the mat­ter pri­vately on con­di­tion the ac­tor agree to re­ceive “mean­ing­ful and con­sis­tent psy­cho­log­i­cal treat­ment”.</p>
    <p>“Since he was un­will­ing to agree to get ap­pro­pri­ate help, Ms Bar­nett filed this suit to pre­vent oth­ers from un­know­ingly suf­fer­ing sim­i­lar abuse by him.”</p>
    <p>LaBeouf starred in se­ries Even Stevens (2000 to 2003) and in films like Trans­form­ers (2007 to 2011) and In­di­ana Jones And The King­dom Of The Crys­tal Skull (2008).</p>
    <p>The past decade has seen him hav­ing sev­eral run-ins with the law for dis­or­derly con­duct, drunk driv­ing and anger man­age­ment is­sues.</p>
    <p>LaBeouf sought treat­ment for al­co­holism in 2014 and 2017.</p>
