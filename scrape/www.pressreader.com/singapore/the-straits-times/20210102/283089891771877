    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Make the most of your ex­plo­sive en­ergy. You should be able to show at least one per­son how to come out of his shell if you feel like it.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>The day is all about at­tach­ment – so make sure you are pay­ing close at­ten­tion to what is hold­ing you down and what is keep­ing you se­cure.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Your big ideas need to be put to work – so roll up those sleeves and get to it. You should not find it hard to make progress.</p>
    <p>Cancer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Try to get a good deal, es­pe­cially when work­ing with fi­nan­cial ex­perts. They may not have your best in­ter­ests at heart.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Now is the time to build on your strengths. You may find that at least one per­son is ea­ger to help out and he is not just rid­ing on your coat-tails.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>You can­not lay down the law as force­fully as you would like. Your en­ergy is not quite in sync with the day, but it will be soon enough.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>You may be mo­men­tar­ily flum­moxed by a small de­tail that ap­pears big­ger than it re­ally is. Do not sweat it – you can han­dle any­thing that arises.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Keep your head down. Things are pretty weird, but as long as you keep from draw­ing too much at­ten­tion to your­self, all will be well.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>Make a point of be­ing pleas­ant and cheer­ful all day and you should see a huge re­turn on your in­vest­ment. Things should im­prove steadily.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>Your life seems to be an up­hill climb, but that could just mean you have taken on the right level of chal­lenge. If it gets too tir­ing, take a break.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>You have dis­cov­ered some­thing new – so much so that you may find that things are turned around by the time you have read­justed to your new re­al­ity.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>Your boss is hard to deal with. Try not to an­tag­o­nise him, but at the same time, you need to stand up for your­self to avoid be­ing knocked over.</p>
