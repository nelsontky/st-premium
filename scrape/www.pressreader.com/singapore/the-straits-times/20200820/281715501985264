    <p>There were 93 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 56,031.</p>
    <p>A seven-year-old girl is among six im­ported Covid-19 pa­tients. The In­dian na­tional is a de­pen­dant’s pass holder and ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore from In­dia on Aug 10.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, the Health Min­istry said it has con­tacted and fa­cil­i­tated test­ing for 321 peo­ple who had vis­ited Jewel Mu­sic Box KTV at HomeTeamNS Khatib on Aug 1 and Aug 2.</p>
    <p>The tests were a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure fol­low­ing the de­tec­tion of three cases that had vis­ited the KTV on those dates, even though the risk of in­fec­tion for vis­i­tors was as­sessed to be low.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said 293 peo­ple had been swabbed so far and 193 re­sults came back neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>The neg­a­tive re­sults i ncluded four in­di­vid­u­als who had re­ported acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion symp­toms and were sent to hospi­tal for fur­ther med­i­cal as­sess­ment.</p>
    <p>There are 100 swabs pend­ing re­sults, and the min­istry is fa­cil­i­tat­ing test­ing for the 28 peo­ple who have yet to be swabbed.</p>
    <p>Among the other im­ported cases are two Sin­ga­porean women aged 44 and 32. The 44-year-old ar­rived here from In­dia on Aug 7, while the 32-year-old ar­rived from the United Arab Emi­rates on Aug 8.</p>
    <p>They were asymp­tomatic and tested pos­i­tive for the virus be­tween Tues­day and yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The other im­ported cases are a Viet­namese stu­dent pass holder, an In­dian na­tional and a Chi­nese work per­mit holder. They had all tested pos­i­tive be­tween Tues­day and yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>All six im­ported pa­tients were placed on 14-day stay-home no­tice on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, and were serv­ing their no­tices at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties. They were tested while serv­ing their no­tices.</p>
    <p>The two com­mu­nity cases re­ported yes­ter­day were two work per­mit hold­ers who are In­dian na­tion­als. One case is linked, while the other is un­linked.</p>
    <p>They were de­tected dur­ing the min­istry’s pe­ri­odic test­ing of work­ers in es­sen­tial ser­vices who are stay­ing out­side the dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 85 new coro­n­avirus pa­tients an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Three clus­ters in dor­mi­to­ries were closed as the dorms have been cleared by the in­ter-agency task force and now house only re­cov­ered in­di­vid­u­als and those who have re­cently tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19 in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of two cases per day in the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of one case per day over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 277 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 52,795 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 87 pa­tients re­main in hospi­tal, while 3,107 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. None is in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>The down­turn has hit op­er­a­tions and per­for­mance hard, added the firm, which has al­ready tight­ened ex­pen­di­ture across the com­pany, in­clud­ing re­duc­ing salaries for se­nior man­age­ment by up to 30 per cent.</p>
    <p>The re­trench­ments will af­fect a higher per­cent­age of for­eign­ers com­pared with Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
