    <p>It’s a warm, sul­try af­ter­noon and Moon­fang is strolling l an­guidly down the third-floor cor­ri­dor of a light industrial build­ing in Ben­de­meer. Fra­ter­nal twins Joe and Mar­cus Wee, 36, stop to pat the mixed breed tor­toise­shell cat.</p>
    <p>“She’s our mas­cot and our CEO, cat ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer. She’s been with our com­pany since its found­ing i n 2012,” says Mar­cus, co­founder and man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Af­ter­shock, Sin­ga­pore’s big­gest bou­tique PC builder.</p>
    <p>He fol­lows her line of sight, and looks at work­ers beaver­ing away out­side the com­pany’s op­er­a­tions of­fice.</p>
    <p>“We moved here five years ago into a 3,300 sq ft unit, won­der­ing how we were going to fill up the space. To­day, we oc­cupy nine units in this build­ing,” he says with a grin.</p>
    <p>And in a Covid-bat­tered cli­mate when many busi­ness own­ers are forced to em­bark on the un­savoury ex­er­cises of cut­ting wages and re­trench­ing work­ers, the twins have just added more than 20 peo­ple to their pay­roll, tak­ing their staff strength to about 150 in three coun­tries: Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia and Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>“Our com­puter sales have gone up by 30 per cent be­cause more peo­ple are work­ing from home and gam­ing dur­ing the pan­demic,” says Mar­cus.</p>
    <p>If pro­jec­tions are on track, Af­ter­shock and its two off­shoot busi­nesses will rake in $100 mil­lion in rev­enue this year.</p>
    <p>Hard­core gamers, the twins would prob­a­bly have snorted and chor­tled if one had sug­gested to them 10 years ago that they’d be run­ning a suc­cess­ful busi­ness</p>
    <p>“It’s still a bit sur­real ac­tu­ally,” says Mar­cus who is younger than Joe by seven min­utes.</p>
    <p>The broth­ers have no sib­lings: their fa­ther was an in­sur­ance man­ager and their mother, a den­tist.</p>
    <p>“We are op­po­sites but we com­ple­ment each other,” says Joe, Af­ter­shock’s cre­ative di­rec­tor. “He gets very ob­sessed about the most ran­dom things. At one point when we were grow­ing up, he was re­ally into rubber trees, so he found out ev­ery­thing about them.</p>
    <p>“Me? I didn’t re­alise I was al­ler­gic to rice un­til re­cently, so I slept a lot grow­ing up, even dur­ing ex­ams,” he says with a grin.</p>
    <p>His brother agrees that he’s the greater nerd.</p>
    <p>“My hobby as a kid was buy­ing cir­cuit boards and sol­der­ing iron to make toys. Joe was more artis­tic, he was al­ways draw­ing.”</p>
    <p>Their com­mon pas­sion was gam­ing; they were crazy about Su­per Nin­tendo.</p>
    <p>When they were 14, their par­ents sent the for­mer stu­dents of An­gloChi­nese School to Gee­long Gram­mar School, a boarding school near Mel­bourne.</p>
    <p>Mar­cus says: “It was prob­a­bly the best de­ci­sion they made. Those were our for­ma­tive years; we learnt in­de­pen­dence, how to deal with dif­fer­ent peo­ple and en­vi­ron­ments. Some of the kids had very in­ter­est­ing back­grounds. One of their fa­thers owned a foot­ball team.”</p>
    <p>Gee­long ex­panded their minds but did not re­press their mis­chievous per­son­al­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Joe learnt to un­lock the com­puter room with a clothes hanger so that he could play com­puter games there at night. His brother did the same by clam­ber­ing in through the window in­stead.</p>
    <p>“I’m re­ally ob­ses­sive. If I do something, I do it to the max. I was com­pet­i­tive and al­ways wanted to get ranked in leagues and ta­bles,” Mar­cus says, adding that he took part in many com­pe­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>Joe also en­joyed get­ting high scores but tour­na­ments and rank­ing boards were not im­por­tant to him.</p>
    <p>Mar­cus says: “If something came with a bounty, I’d def­i­nitely do it. Joe is not mo­ti­vated by such things.”</p>
    <p>Upon com­plet­ing their na­tional ser­vice in 2005, the twins went to Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Uni­ver­sity (SMU) – Joe to study com­mu­ni­ca­tions and psy­chol­ogy and Mar­cus, in­for­ma­tion sys­tems.</p>
    <p>With a laugh, Mar­cus says his pas­sion for gam­ing got more in­tense. Dur­ing va­ca­tions, he could spend up to 16 hours shoot­ing or strate­gis­ing in front of a com­puter screen. It af­fected his stud­ies; he had to re­peat one se­mes­ter.</p>
    <p>“I was a re­ally ir­re­spon­si­ble kid. I skipped too many classes to play games.”</p>
    <p>There was an up­side, though. Be­cause of his pas­sion, Mar­cus – who had been tin­ker­ing with com­puter sys­tems since his early teens – was more than con­ver­sant with lap­tops.</p>
    <p>“I love gam­ing lap­tops. They fol­low you ev­ery­where, from school to home and back. But in those days, your only choice, if you wanted one, was a branded one from an MNC. And they were ex­pen­sive. The mark-up was crazy. In the US, there were a lot of PC builders and their stuff was amaz­ing. I got my lap­top there for half the price of what it would cost me here,” he says.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, cus­tom op­tions were com­pli­cated and, if avail­able, came with no after-sales ser­vice.</p>
    <p>“One or two com­pa­nies were buy­ing from the US and then re­selling here. But if you had prob­lems and needed re­pairs, you’d run into a lot of dif­fi­cul­ties.”</p>
    <p>He felt there was room for dis­rup­tion by of­fer­ing cus­tomised PCs and lap­tops us­ing qual­ity com­po­nents – with com­plete after-sales support – at lower prices.</p>
    <p>True to his ob­ses­sive na­ture, he opened up com­put­ers and tin­kered with them, went into fo­rums and ex­ten­sively re­searched com­po­nents and sup­pli­ers. He even pre­sented his busi­ness idea in an en­trepreneur­ship class at SMU.</p>
    <p>But any plans he had about start­ing the busi­ness upon grad­u­a­tion in 2009 had to wait. He had no money and his folks ex­pected him to start work­ing and earn his own keep.</p>
    <p>His first job was with an em­ployee ben­e­fits com­pany as project man­ager. He worked hard but felt frus­trated that he could not in­flu­ence com­pany decisions be­cause of the cor­po­rate struc­ture. “I just felt like a cog in a ma­chine,” says Mar­cus, who re­signed after a year.</p>
    <p>His next gig was be­ing the “com­puter guy” with TUM Asia, an aca­demic ven­ture abroad by Tech­ni­cal Uni­ver­sity of Mu­nich (TUM), which was do­ing re­search in, among other things, elec­tric cars.</p>
    <p>Not long after an ex­pa­tri­ate col­league, with whom he got along fa­mously, left, Mar­cus quit too.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Joe did pub­lic re­la­tions in a small agency before tak­ing a com­mu­ni­ca­tions job at a Ja­panese multi­na­tional.</p>
    <p>He did not feel chal­lenged, so he left after 1½ years to work and travel through New Zealand with a for­mer girl­friend.</p>
    <p>By then, Mar­cus felt he was ready to ex­e­cute his busi­ness idea.</p>
    <p>He cashed in his in­sur­ance pol­icy and emp­tied his bank ac­count to raise $60,000 and bor­rowed another $80,000 from his aunt and par­ents to start Af­ter­shock in 2012. He also got a busi­ness part­ner who ex­ited after a year.</p>
    <p>Un­der­stand­ably, there was scep­ti­cism.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t ex­actly have a track record; I’d been gam­ing all my life. Some peo­ple asked how I was going to com­pete with the big brands and why I didn’t just get a job.”</p>
    <p>But he was con­vinced he was do­ing the right thing.</p>
    <p>“I knew it would work. I’ve been a data per­son all my life. I had a solid busi­ness plan. I knew my num­bers and my prod­ucts and that I’d be de­liv­er­ing good stuff. It was just a mat­ter of ex­e­cut­ing the idea well,” says Mar­cus, who trav­elled to Tai­wan to get sup­pli­ers of com­po­nents on board.</p>
    <p>Come hell or high wa­ter, he was also de­ter­mined to make it work.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause if not, that would be a blight on my record... Even in gam­ing, I don’t play to lose.”</p>
    <p>That was when he roped his brother – then pluck­ing fruit and trav­el­ling through New Zealand – in.</p>
    <p>“I came back be­cause I didn’t want him to lose my aunt’s money. But when I saw the prod­uct, I knew we were on to a good thing,” quips Joe, who over­sees the com­pany’s brand­ing and mar­ket­ing.</p>
    <p>Mar­cus as­sem­bled the first Af­ter­shock gam­ing lap­top – the X15 – they sold in his brother’s bed­room.</p>
    <p>It was mo­du­lar, he says, “had a high-end graph­ics card al­most un­seen in Sin­ga­pore, and a slew of other fea­tures no one else had”.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, it was at least $2,000 cheaper than a branded equiv­a­lent.</p>
    <p>It took Mar­cus – who per­son­ally as­sem­bled and tested al­most ev­ery com­puter dur­ing the first year – three or four two-hour ses­sions to con­vince his first buyer to part with his money.</p>
    <p>“He was happy with the prod­uct and shared the ex­pe­ri­ence...” he says, adding that they sold four com­put­ers in the first month. “Then it was one a day, and then four or five a day. At our first PC show a year later, we sold 150 units over four days,” says Mar­cus, whose prod­ucts have won dozens of awards – from Best Gam­ing Note­book to Best Com­pact PC – from lead­ing me­dia in­clud­ing Hard­ware Zone, The Straits Times and Geek Cul­ture.</p>
    <p>In a good month, the com­pany can now sell up to 3,000 com­put­ers in its three mar­kets. Priced from $399 for a pocket PC that fits in the palm of the hand to more than $10,000 for a pow­er­ful ma­chine, they are now used not just by gamers and stu­dents but also by data sci­en­tists.</p>
    <p>Their first of­fice was an old shop­house in the mid­dle of a red-light dis­trict i n Seran­goon Road and their first hire was Mar­cus’ World of War­craft gam­ing friend.</p>
    <p>“He didn’t ask me. He just turned up and said, ‘I want to work for your com­pany. You don’t have to pay me.’ He was in the lo­gis­tics and ship­ping in­dus­try and he be­came our first sys­tems builder. To­day, he is a part­ner in our Malaysian op­er­a­tions,” says Mar­cus.</p>
    <p>A cou­ple of years ago, the com­pany branched out into two af­fil­i­ate busi­nesses, one of which is the de­sign of er­gonomic desks.</p>
    <p>The guid­ing prin­ci­ple for the busi­ness, say the broth­ers, is sim­ple.</p>
    <p>“We fo­cus on the prod­uct, the mar­ket­ing strat­egy, be­ing at the fore­front of trends and tech­nol­ogy. It’s a sim­ple rule of thumb: keep evolv­ing, keep look­ing for the next big thing and keep i nflu­enc­ing trends,” says Mar­cus, who is mar­ried to a re­gional team co­or­di­na­tor work­ing in an MNC.</p>
    <p>Joe, who is at­tached, chips in: “And of­fer the best cus­tomer and after-sales ser­vice. Even when the most hard­core gamers come to our show­room, we have peo­ple who can tell them all they want to know about the com­put­ers.”</p>
    <p>The twins don’t have much time to game any more but they reckon run­ning a busi­ness is just as in­trigu­ing and chal­leng­ing.</p>
    <p>Mar­cus, for in­stance, has ideas per­co­lat­ing in his head for other im­pact­ful busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>“The world is so big, there are so many things to do. Why should I copy oth­ers?”</p>
