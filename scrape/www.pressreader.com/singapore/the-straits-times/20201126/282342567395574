    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) have been tak­ing off for the past two days on heavy vol­umes with some sig­nif­i­cant move­ments yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The stock was up 17.7 per cent on Mon­day’s close by 9.15am be­fore slid­ing back to end the day 3.86 per cent ahead at $4.58 on trade of 46 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The bulk of its vol­ume came from large trades – each val­ued at more than $150,000. Al­most a hun­dred such large deals were done be­fore 11am, ShareIn­vestor noted.</p>
    <p>The counter started climb­ing on Tues­day amid ac­tive trad­ing, surg­ing 8.4 per cent on 34.1 mil­lion shares – nearly seven times its av­er­age daily turnover of about five mil­lion shares dur­ing the past three months.</p>
    <p>The last time it closed above such lev­els was on May 5, the last day of cum-rights trad­ing be­fore SIA’s $8.8 bil­lion cash call, which in­cluded a rights is­sue of shares and a 10-year manda­tory con­vert­ible bond (MCB).</p>
    <p>The dip in SIA shares on Mon­day af­ter the last-minute post­pone­ment of the Sin­ga­pore-Hong Kong air travel bubble was less se­vere than the drop of Hong Kong peer Cathay Pa­cific Air­ways.</p>
    <p>SIA fin­ished Mon­day 0.5 per cent lower while Cathay Pa­cific fell 4.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>Cathay Pa­cific also re­cov­ered on Tues­day, ad­vanc­ing 7.8 per cent.</p>
    <p>The air travel bubble was put on hold less than 24 hours be­fore the sched­uled launch on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong gov­ern­ments will an­nounce early next month when the flights will res­tart.</p>
    <p>CGS-CIMB noted on Mon­day that while the sus­pen­sion of the travel bubble was dis­ap­point­ing, it will likely be part of “a se­ries of stops and starts on the ar­du­ous road to re­cov­ery”.</p>
    <p>In­vestors have also been op­ti­mistic about the im­pend­ing ar­rival of Covid-19 vac­cines, push­ing SIA’s stock to out­per­form the Straits Times In­dex by 5.3 per cent in the past month, CGS-CIMB an­a­lyst Ray­mond Yap said on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>He re­it­er­ated its “add” call on SIA and tar­get price of $4.57, and said that “pa­tient in­vestors with a one-year hori­zon should be able to reap the re­wards of upcoming Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tions”. CGS-CIMB rec­om­mended in­vestors to buy on any dips.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, SIA an­nounced on Tues­day night that $500 mil­lion worth of 3.5 per cent, 10-year notes, will be is­sued on Dec 2. The of­fer, launched with an ini­tial size of $300 mil­lion, was up­sized af­ter “strong ap­petite was ap­par­ent from a se­lect group of pri­vate in­vestors”.</p>
    <p>Net pro­ceeds from the is­suance will be used for gen­eral pur­poses, in­clud­ing re­fi­nanc­ing bor­row­ings.</p>
    <p>With the $500 mil­lion notes, SIA has raised about $12.7 bil­lion since the start of the 2021 fi­nan­cial year. That in­cludes $8.8 bil­lion from the rights is­sue and MCB, $2 bil­lion from se­cured fi­nanc­ing, $850 mil­lion via a five-year con­vert­ible bond an­nounced two weeks ago and more than $500 mil­lion through new com­mit­ted lines of credit and a short-term un­se­cured loan.</p>
    <p>SIA stock sank to its low­est in more than two decades on July 30 af­ter the flag car­rier posted its big­gest quar­terly loss as travel de­mand evap­o­rated due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
