    <p>Cof­fee-shop op­er­a­tors can ap­ply to get up to 90 per cent fund­ing from the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) to im­prove the clean­li­ness and de­sign of their toi­lets, un­der a new pro­gramme launched on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Coined the Toi­let Im­prove­ment Pro­gramme, the fund­ing – capped at $45,000 – will cover bet­ter de­signs, newer tech­nolo­gies, as well as more ef­fec­tive clean­ing mea­sures for toi­lets in cof­fee shops and hawker cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Only cof­fee-shop op­er­a­tors who re­move ex­ist­ing smok­ing cor­ners on their premises are el­i­gi­ble for 90 per cent fund­ing.</p>
    <p>“This is to in­cen­tivise cof­feeshop op­er­a­tors who have smok­ing cor­ners on their premises to erad­i­cate the prob­lem of sec­ond-hand smoke and cre­ate a more pleas­ant din­ing en­vi­ron­ment for all their pa­trons,” the NEA said.</p>
    <p>Those who do not have ex­ist­ing smok­ing cor­ners on their premises are el­i­gi­ble for 70 per cent fund­ing, capped at $35,000. Those who choose not to re­move ex­ist­ing smok­ing cor­ners can get 60 per cent fund­ing, capped at $30,000.</p>
    <p>If cof­fee-shop op­er­a­tors ac­cept the fund­ing, it would be manda­tory for them to have a con­tract to carry out deep clean­ing of ren­o­vated toi­lets once ev­ery fort­night.</p>
    <p>The NEA said the cost of deep clean­ing will be sub­sidised up to 90 per cent for the first year and it should be car­ried out on top of the daily clean­ing of the toi­lets.</p>
    <p>A study con­ducted by the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity that was re­leased in May found that pub­lic toi­let hy­giene stan­dards have de­clined sig­nif­i­cantly in lo­cal hawker cen­tres and cof­fee shops, with toi­lets in cof­fee shops be­ing com­par­a­tively dirt­ier.</p>
    <p>Mr Ed­ward D’Silva, chair­man of the Pub­lic Hy­giene Coun­cil, said it is im­por­tant to keep pub­lic toi­lets clean as they con­trib­ute to the over­all clean­li­ness and hy­giene of the din­ing en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>“Di­lap­i­dated toi­lets that are wet and dirty are po­ten­tial breed­ing grounds for germs and viruses. If stall­hold­ers do not have clean toi­lets, this may lead to con­tam­i­na­tion of the food they pre­pare for us,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Ken­neth Lee, who op­er­ates Hai Fong Cof­feeshop in Toa Payoh, said he is keen to ap­ply for the pro­gramme, but is con­cerned that the ren­o­va­tion of toi­lets might im­pact his busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“Ren­o­va­tion re­sults in a lot of dust in the air and I’m afraid that would af­fect the hy­giene of the food and the en­vi­ron­ment. It could also af­fect the busi­ness of the cof­fee shop as some din­ers do not like loud con­struc­tion noises,” he said.</p>
    <p>But Mr Lee, who is also chair­man of Kheng Keow Cof­fee Mer­chants Restau­rant and Bar Own­ers As­so­ci­a­tion, said the scheme is good for older cof­fee shops like his, where toi­lets have not un­der­gone ren­o­va­tion in the last 20 years.</p>
    <p>The Toi­let Im­prove­ment Pro­gramme also cov­ers hawker cen­tres, with a fo­cus on im­prov­ing the de­sign of toi­lets, the choice of san­i­tary fit­tings, as well as to en­cour­age users to main­tain toi­let clean­li­ness.</p>
    <p>The fund­ing will be given to the re­spec­tive town coun­cils and the amount awarded will also de­pend on the treat­ment of smok­ing cor­ners.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme is slated to run till March 31, 2022.</p>
    <p>Other ef­forts to im­prove toi­let hy­giene in­clude a half-day train­ing ses­sion for clean­ers launched by the NEA and the Re­stroom As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore) on Sept 1.</p>
    <p>After the train­ing ses­sion, the as­so­ci­a­tion will con­duct an au­dit and give ad­vice to cof­fee-shop op­er­a­tors on toi­let main­te­nance.</p>
    <p>As of last Wed­nes­day, the NEA said, 214 cof­fee-shop op­er­a­tors have sent their clean­ers for train­ing.</p>
