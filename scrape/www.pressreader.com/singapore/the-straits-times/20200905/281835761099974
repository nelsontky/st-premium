    <p>WASH­ING­TON Dr Mon­cef Slaoui, the chief ad­viser for the White House vac­cine pro­gramme, has said that it was “ex­tremely un­likely but not im­pos­si­ble” that a vac­cine could be avail­able by the end of next month.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with Na­tional Pub­lic Ra­dio, Dr Slaoui, the chief sci­en­tific ad­viser of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s coro­n­avirus vac­cine and treat­ment ini­tia­tive, called Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed, ex­plained that the Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion’s (CDC) guid­ance to states to pre­pare for a vac­cine as early as late Oc­to­ber – a no­ti­fi­ca­tion Dr Slaoui said he had learnt of through the news me­dia – was “the right thing to do” in case a vac­cine was ready by that time.</p>
    <p>“It would be ir­re­spon­si­ble not to be ready if that was the case,” he said. How­ever, he de­scribed that as a “very, very low chance”.</p>
    <p>That mes­sage ran counter to the op­ti­mistic as­ser­tions in re­cent days from the White House that a vac­cine could be ready for distri­bu­tion be­fore elec­tion day on Nov 3.</p>
    <p>At the Repub­li­can Na­tional Con­ven­tion, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said a vac­cine could be ready “be­fore the end of the year or maybe even sooner”.</p>
    <p>US Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence said yes­ter­day that the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion would not “cut cor­ners” in mak­ing a vac­cine for the coro­n­avirus avail­able, al­though it wants to move as fast as pos­si­ble to de­liver some­thing that is safe and ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>“We’re not go­ing to cut cor­ners in the de­vel­op­ment of a vac­cine, but at the same time, through Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed, the pres­i­dent has made it clear that we want a safe and ef­fec­tive vac­cine avail­able for the Amer­i­can peo­ple ab­so­lutely as soon as is pos­si­ble to have,” Mr Pence told Fox Busi­ness Net­work.</p>
    <p>Dr Slaoui con­firmed that the two main can­di­dates, re­ferred to as Vac­cine A and Vac­cine B, were be­ing de­vel­oped by Pfizer and Moderna.</p>
    <p>He said that there was “no in­tent” to in­tro­duce a vac­cine be­fore clin­i­cal tri­als were com­pleted, and that tri­als would be com­pleted only when an in­de­pen­dent safety mon­i­tor­ing board, sep­a­rate from the gov­ern­ment, af­firmed the ef­fec­tive­ness of the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The in­ter­viewer, Ms Mary Louise Kelly, raised the tim­ing of a pos­si­ble vac­cine given in the doc­u­ments that the CDC re­cently sent to pub­lic health of­fi­cials, and asked di­rectly whether the de­liv­ery of the vac­cine was be­ing mo­ti­vated by po­lit­i­cal con­cerns.</p>
    <p>“For us, there is ab­so­lutely noth­ing to do with pol­i­tics,” Dr Slaoui re­sponded, say­ing that those in­volved were work­ing as hard as they could be­cause so many peo­ple were dy­ing ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>Though he con­tin­ued to ex­press doubt that a vac­cine would be ready by the end of next month, Dr Slaoui said, “I firmly be­lieve that we will have a vac­cine avail­able be­fore the end of the year, and it will be avail­able in quan­ti­ties that can im­mu­nise pa­tients, sub­jects at the high­est risk”, in­clud­ing the el­derly and those who are work­ing in jobs with high ex­po­sure to the virus.</p>
    <p>He es­ti­mated there would be enough vac­cine by the end of the year to im­mu­nise “prob­a­bly be­tween 20 (mil­lion) and 25 mil­lion peo­ple”. He said that man­u­fac­tur­ing would be ramped up so that there would be enough doses for the United States’ pop­u­la­tion “by the mid­dle of 2021”.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) does not expect wide­spread vac­ci­na­tions against Covid-19 un­til t h e mi d d l e o f n e x t y e a r , a spokesman said yes­ter­day, stress­ing the im­por­tance of rig­or­ous checks on their ef­fec­tive­ness and safety.</p>
    <p>None of the can­di­date vac­cines in ad­vanced clin­i­cal tri­als so far has demon­strated a “clear sig­nal” of ef­fi­cacy at the level of at least 50 per cent sought by the WHO, spokesman Mar­garet Har­ris said.</p>
    <p>I firmly be­lieve that we will have a vac­cine avail­able be­fore the end of the year, and it will be avail­able in quan­ti­ties that can im­mu­nise pa­tients, sub­jects at the high­est risk.</p>
