    <p>When will phase three of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing come around?</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans, my­self in­cluded, have been look­ing for­ward to a fur­ther eas­ing of mea­sures when the coun­try moves into its “new nor­mal” stage amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>There may be a chance that it could take place be­fore the end of this year, said Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong at a press con­fer­ence ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>But he also set out three key con­di­tions that, if not met, could see phase three de­layed to Jan­uary or “some time early next year”.</p>
    <p>Of these three con­di­tions, Sin­ga­pore is “pro­ceed­ing well” in terms of hav­ing suf­fi­cient test­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties in place, said</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, who co-chairs the multi-min­istry task force han­dling the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pa­tion in the TraceTo­gether pro­gramme – the other key plank of re­open­ing – is, how­ever, still hov­er­ing around 50 per cent, some way from the 75 per cent needed for ef­fec­tive con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>An on­go­ing ex­er­cise to dis­trib­ute to­kens to res­i­dents is­land­wide is slated to wrap up only by the end of this year, af­ter an unan­tic­i­pated surge in de­mand at the start prompted the au­thor­i­ties to stag­ger dis­tri­bu­tion at com­mu­nity cen­tres to spread out sup­ply.</p>
    <p>For the third con­di­tion – com­ply­ing with and tak­ing safe man­age­ment mea­sures se­ri­ously – the score card is mixed, with some peo­ple still flout­ing the rules.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment re­cently flagged how a group of 20 peo­ple met for a birth­day cel­e­bra­tion at Labrador Na­ture Re­serve.</p>
    <p>In other cases, be­tween 12 and 50 peo­ple were found gath­er­ing at var­i­ous parks, birth­day cel­e­bra­tions or baby show­ers, or play­ing sports at game courts in Hous­ing Board es­tates.</p>
    <p>Such large gath­er­ings in de­fi­ance of the rules may not seem like a big deal in an en­vi­ron­ment where com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion is low.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of Covid-19 cases in the com­mu­nity has been de­creas­ing, from the low sin­gle dig­its to none in the past week.</p>
    <p>With the virus sit­u­a­tion in Sin­ga­pore un­der con­trol at the mo­ment, it is per­haps nat­u­ral to be lulled into a false sense of se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>But when Sin­ga­pore fur­ther re­opens its econ­omy and bor­ders, breach­ing the rules could well have se­vere im­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans have al­ready been warned to be men­tally pre­pared that the num­ber of com­mu­nity cases will rise – pos­si­bly up to the 30s – when mea­sures are eased fur­ther.</p>
    <p>In such a sce­nario, the num­ber of un­de­tected cases in the com­mu­nity would rise as well.</p>
    <p>The dan­ger of the coro­n­avirus is that peo­ple ap­pear to be most in­fec­tious just be­fore they de­velop symp­toms, and early in their ill­ness. Asymp­to­matic car­ri­ers can eas­ily and un­wit­tingly in­fect oth­ers around them.</p>
    <p>All it would take is for one such un­de­tected Covid-19 case who flouts safe dis­tanc­ing rules to spark a large virus clus­ter.</p>
    <p>The experience­s of many coun­tries else­where in the world pro­vide cau­tion­ary tales of how the coro­n­avirus can run ram­pant in places where it was pre­vi­ously un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>SEC­OND WAVES</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the early months of the pan­demic in spring, sev­eral cen­tral Euro­pean coun­tries won praise for their swift re­sponse to con­tain the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The Czech Repub­lic was one of the first coun­tries to im­pose a na­tion­wide lock­down and re­quire face masks to be worn. It loos­ened re­stric­tions over time as the num­ber of daily cases ta­pered off into the dou­ble dig­its.</p>
    <p>On June 30, thou­sands of peo­ple sat at a 500m-long table on the Charles Bridge in Prague for a party to give the coro­n­avirus a “sym­bolic farewell”.</p>
    <p>This cel­e­bra­tion proved pre­ma­ture, as the num­ber of daily cases be­gan to surge in Septem­ber. The spike forced the Czech au­thor­i­ties to or­der a sec­ond lock­down, shut­ting schools and non-es­sen­tial shops and ser­vices. Law­mak­ers sub­se­quently voted to ex­tend the state of emer­gency.</p>
    <p>Daily cases in the Czech Repub­lic peaked at around 15,700 early this month, and the coun­try re­ported 5,407 new con­firmed cases on Tues­day. Else­where in Europe, coun­tries have reg­is­tered record num­bers of daily Covid-19 in­fec­tions this month. Many are in full or par­tial lock­downs to pre­vent their health­care sys­tems from be­ing over­whelmed.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain hit an all-time high of 33,470 daily in­fec­tions on Nov 13, while Italy saw a record 40,902 new cases a day later.</p>
    <p>Closer to home, Malaysia has been re­port­ing new in­fec­tions in the high hun­dreds since the mid­dle of last month. The state of Sabah has been the epi­cen­tre of the dis­ease in Malaysia for most of the past two months since the state elec­tion on Sept 26.</p>
    <p>These ex­am­ples il­lus­trate how eas­ily the coro­n­avirus can gain a foothold and spread like wild­fire once re­stric­tions are eased.</p>
    <p>They il­lus­trate the per­ils when so­ci­eties let their guard down.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, res­i­dents have been pa­tient with the pace of re­open­ing, and gen­er­ally com­pli­ant with safe dis­tanc­ing rules. But the de­sire for a re­turn to old rou­tines and life­styles is pal­pa­ble.</p>
    <p>The crowds have re­turned to malls and din­ing en­claves.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a re­cent visit to Dempsey Hill for a week­day lunch, I was struck by how full the carpark was. Ev­ery table at the restau­rant I went to was oc­cu­pied.</p>
    <p>A col­league from The Straits Times photo desk went to Or­chard Road last Satur­day, and took pho­to­graphs of side­walks packed to the gills, with no safe dis­tanc­ing to speak of.</p>
    <p>Crowds are good for busi­nesses reel­ing from the im­pact of the pan­demic. But they also heighten the risk of con­tract­ing an in­sid­i­ous virus that is ever ready to pounce and repli­cate it­self.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of peo­ple out and about is set to in­crease fur­ther in phase three, should the Gov­ern­ment al­low larger group sizes and raise ca­pac­ity lim­its at pub­lic venues.</p>
    <p>This is why we should not rush into the fi­nal phase of our re­open­ing till all the pieces of our de­fence – con­tact trac­ing, test­ing and broad ad­her­ence to the rules – are in place.</p>
    <p>Don’t get hung up over when phase three will hap­pen. In­stead, think about what each of us needs to do to keep our­selves and our loved ones safe when it rolls around.</p>
    <p>PLAY­ING DE­FENCE</p>
    <p>One thing would be to down­load the TraceTo­gether app, or col­lect the to­ken and carry it around.</p>
    <p>With more res­i­dents on the pro­gramme, con­tact trac­ers will have an eas­ier time pin­point­ing peo­ple ex­posed to a Covid-19 case and ring-fenc­ing them be­fore large clus­ters can form.</p>
    <p>An­other would be to fol­low the rules and avoid large gath­er­ings in pri­vate or in pub­lic.</p>
    <p>It has been a long haul for Sin­ga­pore to get to a stage where it has only 28 Covid-19 pa­tients be­ing treated in hos­pi­tals as at Thurs­day, with one in the in­ten­sive care unit and zero com­mu­nity cases in the past week.</p>
    <p>But should the virus resur­face in nu­mer­ous un­linked cases, a re­turn to phase one mea­sures – where most re­tail out­lets had to stay closed and din­ing out was not al­lowed – or even a sec­ond cir­cuit breaker could well hap­pen.</p>
    <p>Clo­sures will be painful and ex­act a se­vere toll on an econ­omy that is still strug­gling to re­cover.</p>
    <p>Thus the need for ev­ery­one to play their part in keep­ing the virus un­der check, and for the coun­try to re­open care­fully, lest it be forced into a pre­ma­ture shut­down.</p>
