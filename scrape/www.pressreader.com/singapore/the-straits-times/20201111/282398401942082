    <p>• Tokyo Olympics or­gan­is­ers yes­ter­day said news of a pos­si­ble coro­n­avirus vac­cine was a “re­lief” but in­sisted their bio-se­cu­rity plan­ning for the post­poned Games re­mained un­changed.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials have reg­u­larly said that a vac­cine is not a pre­con­di­tion for stag­ing the Games, now sched­uled to start in July. But they have ac­knowl­edged a suc­cess­ful shot would make their task sig­nif­i­cantly eas­ier, and wel­comed the 90 per cent ef­fec­tive­ness shown by a trial vac­cine co-de­vel­oped by Pfizer and BioN­Tech.</p>
    <p>“The or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee is not dis­con­nected from so­ci­ety... and I heard the vac­cine news,” Tokyo 2020 Games de­liv­ery of­fi­cer Hide­masa Naka­mura told re­porters at a brief­ing.</p>
    <p>“The or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee is feel­ing the same as you prob­a­bly felt, pos­i­tive sen­ti­ment and re­lief.</p>
    <p>“What we are do­ing right now is not think­ing about the vac­cine, be­cause we don’t have a vac­cine yet, but rather fo­cus­ing on test­ing, so­cial dis­tance and also the co­op­er­a­tion be­tween the ath­letes and the other stake­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>“I think that is what we need to do to cre­ate a safe Games.”</p>
    <p>Global mar­kets soared af­ter US phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal gi­ant Pfizer said on Mon­day tests in­volv­ing more than 40,000 peo­ple had pro­vided re­sults that were a “crit­i­cal mile­stone” in the search for a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The news is likely to be a shot in the arm for Ja­panese of­fi­cials and their Olympic coun­ter­parts, who have faced con­tin­u­ing scep­ti­cism about whether the Games can be held next year if the pan­demic is not un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, Tokyo safely hosted its first in­ter­na­tional sport­ing event since the pan­demic, a four­na­tion gym­nas­tics meet that or­gan­is­ers hailed as proof the Games were pos­si­ble amid the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>While the event in­volved only 30 ath­letes – who had to take daily poly­merase chain re­ac­tion tests on top of hav­ing their move­ments re­stricted – as well as 2,000 so­cially dis­tanced spec­ta­tors, Naka­mura said it was still ev­i­dence the Games are fea­si­ble.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese Gym­nas­tics As­so­ci­a­tion also yes­ter­day re­vealed there had been no pos­i­tive cases among ath­letes or staff and In­ter­na­tional Gym­nas­tics Fed­er­a­tion pres­i­dent Mori­nari Watan­abe said the strict safety mea­sures had left par­tic­i­pants feel­ing as­sured.</p>
    <p>“When they ar­rived in Ja­pan, you could see fear in their eyes,” he said.</p>
    <p>“They were wor­ried they might be in­fected. But each day that they spent time in Ja­pan, they man­aged to ease their fears. At the end of the day, you could see joy.”</p>
    <p>News of Pfizer’s pro­posed vac­cine will likely boost sen­ti­ment with over two-thirds of Ja­panese firms keen for the Games to go ahead next sum­mer, al­beit with re­stric­tions on spec­ta­tor num­bers, a poll done by Reuters said.</p>
    <p>While most be­lieve any boost to the econ­omy would be lim­ited, it was still “bet­ter than noth­ing”.</p>
    <p>The re­sults con­trasted sharply with pub­lic opin­ion polls ear­lier this year, with one poll done by broad­caster NHK in July show­ing two-thirds of re­spon­dents felt the Games should ei­ther be can­celled or post­poned fur­ther.</p>
    <p>The Reuters sur­vey of large and medium non-fi­nan­cial com­pa­nies was con­ducted from Oct 26 to Nov 4 and showed 68 per cent be­lieve the Games should go ahead.</p>
