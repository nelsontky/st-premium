    <p>A spe­cialised chil­dren’s agency and beefed-up coun­selling re­sources were among the pro­pos­als raised by MPs yes­ter­day to help vul­ner­a­ble in­di­vid­u­als and en­sure that they get the sup­port they need amid the cur­rent cri­sis and be­yond.</p>
    <p>Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang GRC) called for an equiv­a­lent of the Agency for In­te­grated Care – which sup­ports se­niors and their care­givers – to su­per­vise, men­tor and fos­ter un­der­priv­i­leged chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Ms Joan Pereira (Tan­jong Pa­gar GRC) sug­gested the Gov­ern­ment sup­port vul­ner­a­ble fam­i­lies by chan­nelling more re­sources into coun­selling ser­vices and mu­tual sup­port net­works backed by ex­pe­ri­enced pro­fes­sion­als and other com­mu­nity part­ners.</p>
    <p>Both MPs were speak­ing dur­ing the debate on the Gov­ern­ment’s strat­egy to emerge stronger from the Covid-19 pan­demic, which was out­lined by Deputy Prime Min­is­ter</p>
    <p>Heng Swee Keat in his min­is­te­rial state­ment in Par­lia­ment on Oct 5.</p>
    <p>Mr Wee, a first-term MP, noted that chil­dren in Sin­ga­pore al­ready have a right to liv­ing ne­ces­si­ties, ed­u­ca­tion and health­care.</p>
    <p>“What we need is ef­fec­tive over­sight for chil­dren in low-income fam­i­lies to en­sure that they are re­ceiv­ing these es­sen­tials,” he said.</p>
    <p>“In a knowl­edge-in­ten­sive fu­ture, these chil­dren will not stand a chance if they live in over­crowded flats with ac­cess to bor­rowed equip­ment, lim­ited or slow con­nec­tiv­ity, and min­i­mal adult su­per­vi­sion and guid­ance.”</p>
    <p>The state must be pre­pared to in­ter­vene more, and the ear­lier the bet­ter, added Mr Wee.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, if the adults in the fam­i­lies pass away or are im­pris­oned, the state must step in to pro­tect and pro­vide for these kids. Chil­dren un­ac­counted for must be traced. Schools should alert rel­e­vant agen­cies when chil­dren do not seem to cope well,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Pro­tect­ing them, help­ing them, lift­ing them up will pre­vent a fu­ture group of po­ten­tial per­ma­nent un­der­class. We should watch over our chil­dren as zeal­ously as we would over our re­serves.</p>
    <p>“Within 10 to 20 years, we will be able to see the fruits of our ef­forts... We can boost lit­er­acy and ed­u­ca­tion lev­els, re­duce crime and re­cidi­vism rates, and im­prove health out­comes,” Mr Wee con­cluded.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing af­ter him, Ms Pereira em­pha­sised the im­por­tance of the Gov­ern­ment let­ting vul­ner­a­ble fam­i­lies know that they are not alone, by cre­at­ing net­works for them to get tips and en­cour­age­ment from pro­fes­sion­als and com­mu­nity part­ners alike.</p>
    <p>She also urged ad­di­tional help for the “sand­wiched” class – in par­tic­u­lar, young fam­i­lies who might have been start­ing out in their ca­reers when the Covid-19 pan­demic struck.</p>
    <p>“I hope the Gov­ern­ment will con­sider pro­vid­ing higher sub­si­dies for their chil­dren’s med­i­cal and in­sur­ance ex­penses, in­clud­ing some sup­port for ex­pen­di­ture for the third child on­wards,” said Ms Pereira, who works at Te­masek Foun­da­tion Cares, the phil­an­thropic arm of Te­masek.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, Ms Ch­eryl Chan (East Coast GRC) had also high­lighted the need to aid vul­ner­a­ble groups such as low-wage work­ers, se­niors and the spe­cial needs com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>She said that sev­eral of these in­di­vid­u­als had held jobs as es­sen­tial and front-line work­ers dur­ing the pan­demic; although those in ser­vice in­dus­tries might have been dis­placed dur­ing cir­cuit breaker mea­sures ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>“The larger im­pact they face goes be­yond income, as a daily rou­tine has re­ally be­come dis­rupted,” Ms Chan said of this group.</p>
    <p>“And this... has a huge im­pact on (their) men­tal state, es­pe­cially for those with spe­cial needs.”</p>
    <p>She con­cluded by ques­tion­ing whether, mov­ing for­ward, more av­enues could be cre­ated for both se­niors and spe­cial needs adults to take up mi­cro jobs or even re­mote work.</p>
