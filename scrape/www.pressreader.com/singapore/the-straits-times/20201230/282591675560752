    <p>•</p>
    <p>NEW YORK Pixar’s an­i­ma­tors have a history of achiev­ing im­pres­sive feats, mak­ing char­ac­ters and tex­tures feel more au­then­tic in in­creas­ingly com­plex ways. (That flow­ing hair! Those land­scapes!) But how would they por­tray jazz?</p>
    <p>With Soul, the chal­lenge was to translate the mu­sic’s emo­tional and im­pro­vi­sa­tional qual­i­ties through a tech­ni­cal process with lit­tle room for im­pro­vi­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>While plenty of an­i­ma­tion over the years has got­ten the spirit of jazz, Soul sits right next to the pi­ano keys to show, in de­tail, a mu­si­cian cre­at­ing.</p>
    <p>And Pixar knew many eyes, es­pe­cially those be­long­ing to jazz mu­si­cians, would be ex­am­in­ing its work.</p>
    <p>The film fol­lows Joe Gard­ner (voiced by Jamie Foxx), a school band teacher by day, a tal­ented but un­suc­cess­ful jazz pian­ist by night. He strug­gles to get gigs, but when he sits at the pi­ano, he is trans­ported, his stress fades and his pas­sion emerges with each note.</p>
    <p>Pixar film-mak­ers, known for at­ten­tion to de­tail – in Cars (2006, 2011, 2017) the mo­tor sounds of each ve­hi­cle came from the same model’s ac­tual en­gine – knew that cap­tur­ing the fun­da­men­tals of jazz per­for­mance would not be pos­si­ble with­out the col­lab­o­ra­tion of jazz artists.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to make sure that if this guy is go­ing to be a jazz mu­si­cian, he should know the clubs and the back­story,” the film’s di­rec­tor, Pete Doc­ter, said in a video in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>He and his team vis­ited clubs in New York to get a better un­der­stand­ing.</p>
    <p>“We would just go up and talk to mu­si­cians and ask them, ‘Where did you study? How did you get here? What other jobs do you have?’ And tried to re­ally flesh out the world of those char­ac­ters,” he said.</p>
    <p>They also con­sulted a num­ber of mar­quee mu­si­cians, in­clud­ing Her­bie Han­cock, jazz drum­mer Terri Lyne Car­ring­ton and Quest­love</p>
    <p>(who also did voice work).</p>
    <p>Pixar also brought on key­boardist Jon Batiste, the band­leader and mu­si­cal di­rec­tor on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert (2015 to present).</p>
    <p>He cre­ated the orig­i­nal com­po­si­tions that Joe per­forms on screen. Batiste recorded the mu­sic with a band in a New York stu­dio and Doc­ter cap­tured those ses­sions with mul­ti­ple cam­eras.</p>
    <p>“We set up, like, 80 GoPros ev­ery­where,” Doc­ter said. They then stud­ied the video to get a more ac­cu­rate pic­ture of how to an­i­mate the scene.</p>
    <p>Doc­ter said that the an­i­ma­tors ex­ag­ger­ated cer­tain move­ments in Joe’s play­ing for vis­ual ef­fect, but “in terms of pos­ture and hit­ting the right notes, that was cru­cial for us to make sure that it re­ally felt au­then­tic”.</p>
    <p>Along with video, they were able to dig­i­tally save the notes that were be­ing played.</p>
    <p>That dig­i­tal stream could be re­verse-pro­grammed into the an­i­ma­tion in a way that worked al­most like a player pi­ano sig­nalling to the an­i­ma­tors which key was be­ing played with each note. So when you see Joe at the pi­ano, he is play­ing ex­actly the notes you are hear­ing.</p>
    <p>At the record­ing ses­sions, Doc­ter said, his ap­proach to di­rect­ing Batiste was sim­i­lar to the way he di­rects ac­tors: He avoided giv­ing spe­cific line read­ings or in­put on the mu­sic and in­stead tried to paint a pic­ture so Batiste could un­der­stand the mood of the scene.</p>
    <p>“I might just say, ‘You know that sense when you’re play­ing and the world just dis­ap­pears, and you wake up, and three hours have gone by? That’s what we’re look­ing for,’” Doc­ter said.</p>
    <p>Batiste would make ad­just­ments to his com­po­si­tions dur­ing the ses­sion to match the film’s needs.</p>
    <p>Batiste said that he felt a con­nec­tion with Doc­ter in cre­at­ing these scenes – “Pete is a healer and a philoso­pher”, he said by e-mail – and that he was glad to see the care with which black mu­sic was be­ing treated.</p>
    <p>Doc­ter grew up play­ing mu­sic. Two of his sis­ters are pro­fes­sional mu­si­cians and his par­ents are mu­sic ed­u­ca­tors. So that made it eas­ier to sync up with the film’s mu­si­cal pas­sions.</p>
    <p>And on his team, he said, those who were an­i­mat­ing a spe­cific in­stru­ment of­ten ei­ther had ex­pe­ri­ence play­ing that in­stru­ment or a strong ap­pre­ci­a­tion for it.</p>
    <p>Joe is brought to life in three ways: through Foxx’s vo­cal per­for­mance, the char­ac­ter’s de­sign and move­ment, and Batiste’s com­po­si­tions and per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>Those close-up shots of Joe’s hands in mo­tion re­flect the pian­ist’s spir­ited style of play – so much so that Batiste was taken aback when he saw those mo­ments on screen.</p>
    <p>“My hands are cen­tral to my life,” he said. “I was in tears when I saw my essence come to life in Joe. To have this as a part of my cre­ative legacy is an hon­our.” NY­TIMES</p>
