    <p>Sev­eral out­comes of this year’s gen­eral elec­tion, such as the loss of Sengkang GRC to the Work­ers’ Party (WP) and over­all swing to­wards the op­po­si­tion, could have been less sur­pris­ing if po­lit­i­cal par­ties had paid greater at­ten­tion to warn­ing sig­nals from so­cial me­dia data, said Mr Chua Chin Hon, chief data an­a­lyst at AI so­lu­tions com­pany An­a­lytix Labs.</p>
    <p>He said the ma­jor par­ties – Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP), WP, Progress Sin­ga­pore Party and Sin­ga­pore Demo­cratic Party – treated so­cial me­dia mainly as dis­tri­bu­tion chan­nels for their mes­sages. This “fire-and-for­get” ap­proach will prove in­creas­ingly costly in fu­ture elec­tions, he said.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at an on­line fo­rum or­gan­ised by the In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies yes­ter­day, he said there were four “missed sig­nals” be­fore Polling Day:</p>
    <p>1. COVID-19 DESENSITIS­ATION</p>
    <p>By Nomination Day on June 30, user in­ter­ac­tions with Covid-19 Face­book (FB) posts had plunged from their peak in April. “The ‘flight to safety’ in­stinct, if it ex­isted, likely dis­si­pated along the way,” Mr Chua said about the be­lief that vot­ers would be more in­clined to sup­port in­cum­bents in a cri­sis.</p>
    <p>2. IVAN LIM IN­CI­DENT</p>
    <p>PAP can­di­date Ivan Lim, 42, who had been walk­ing the ground in Jurong GRC and was ex­pected to be fielded there, with­drew his can­di­dacy af­ter al­le­ga­tions were made about his con­duct at work and as a na­tional ser­vice com­man­der.</p>
    <p>News of his with­drawal blew up on June 27, the day the PAP man­i­festo was launched. That day, FB posts on him at seven lo­cal me­dia out­lets had 62,730 user in­ter­ac­tions, al­most nine times more than those for the launch of the man­i­festo.</p>
    <p>The out­lets were: The Straits Times, Chan­nel News Asia, To­day, Mother­ship, Lianhe Zaobao, Lianhe Wan­bao and Shin Min Daily News. “Some say on­line users are al­ways go­ing to be drawn to drama and con­tro­versy,” said Mr Chua.</p>
    <p>“These are fair points. But when you have an in­ter­ac­tion gap of this size, it should have rung some alarm bells.”</p>
