    <p>• AirAsia founder Tony Fer­nan­des has put up his sprawl­ing Ayr­shire es­tate in Scot­land for sale at £2.5 mil­lion (S$4.5 mil­lion), as the Covid-19 pandemic has taken a toll on air­lines world­wide, ac­cord­ing to Bri­tish tabloid The Sun.</p>
    <p>The es­tate comes com­plete with an 18th-cen­tury clas­si­cal Georgian coun­try house, known as the Skel­don House, nes­tled in an ex­ten­sive nat­u­ral wood­land stretch­ing to the banks of the River Doon.</p>
    <p>The prop­erty, which boasts five bed­rooms in­clud­ing two suites, an all-weather tennis court, a wine cel­lar and sauna fa­cil­i­ties, among oth­ers, was put up for sale on Oct 1.</p>
    <p>Mr Fer­nan­des, who was also a for­mer Queens Park Rangers football club owner, had re­port­edly been liv­ing at the Skel­don House for seven years.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s bud­get car­rier AirAsia had ven­tured into the food delivery busi­ness in March, as flights were mostly grounded, with in­ter­na­tional bor­ders clos­ing to con­tain Covid-19 trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Like many who were hard-hit by the pandemic, Mr Fer­nan­des is re­fo­cus­ing his at­ten­tion on other prof­itable ven­tures deemed sus­tain­able during the pandemic.</p>
    <p>The 56-year-old was cel­e­brated as one of Asia’s top mar­ket­ingsavvy en­trepreneur­s, as he had built his company and him­self into a global brand by pulling creative mar­ket­ing stunts.</p>
    <p>He started his ca­reer in the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try in the early 1990s, ris­ing to build one of the largest bud­get car­ri­ers in the re­gion.</p>
