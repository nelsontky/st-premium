    <p>Malaysia’s King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah, yes­ter­day as­sented to a dec­la­ra­tion of emer­gency in the Sabah par­lia­men­tary con­stituency of Batu Sapi to post­pone a by-elec­tion due there next month, amid wor­ries over the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>A new date will be fixed for the by-elec­tion, which was to have been held on Dec 5.</p>
    <p>“His Royal Majesty has as­sented to the procla­ma­tion of emer­gency for P185 Batu Sapi, Sabah, as a proac­tive step to curb the Covid-19 pan­demic,” said Comp­trol­ler of the Royal House­hold Ah­mad Fadil Sham­sud­din in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment was made after the King had an hour-long meet­ing with Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin to dis­cuss the is­sue.</p>
    <p>The King was also briefed on the emer­gency pro­posal by health di­rec­tor-gen­eral Noor Hisham Ab­dul­lah, chief sec­re­tary to the Gov­ern­ment Zuki Ali, At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Idris Harun and Elec­tion Com­mis­sion chair­man Ab­dul Ghani Salleh, said Datuk Ah­mad Fadil.</p>
    <p>Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah said it was ap­pro­pri­ate for an emer­gency to be de­clared to de­lay the Batu Sapi by­elec­tion, as it would oth­er­wise see over 3,000 peo­ple trav­el­ling from penin­su­lar Malaysia and Sarawak to vote in Sabah.</p>
    <p>He also noted that the state-wide elec­tion in Sabah on Sept 26 had trig­gered a spike in cases to triple dig­its, after hav­ing dropped to a sin­gle digit pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>On Oct 25, the King had re­jected a pro­posal by Tan Sri Muhyid­din to de­clare a na­tion­wide emer­gency, a plan os­ten­si­bly aimed at tack­ling the Covid-19 pan­demic. Crit­ics, how­ever, claimed that Mr Muhyid­din was us­ing it as an ex­cuse to stay in power and that he no longer com­manded ma­jor­ity sup­port in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Later yes­ter­day, Mr Muhyid­din said in a spe­cial ad­dress on the emer­gency dec­la­ra­tion that there would be no cur­few or mil­i­tary rule en­forced in the Batu Sapi con­stituency, and eco­nomic and so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties could con­tinue, sub­ject to health pro­to­cols un­der the on­go­ing con­di­tional move­ment con­trol or­der for the whole of Sabah.</p>
    <p>He pledged that once the pan­demic was over, the by-elec­tion would take place.</p>
    <p>The Batu Sapi par­lia­men­tary ward lost its rep­re­sen­ta­tive when MP Liew Vui Keong, 60, a for­mer law min­is­ter, died on Oct 2.</p>
    <p>Two other seats have been va­cated in the last few days with the deaths of two law­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>MP Has­bul­lah Os­man from Umno, who was the fed­eral law­maker for Gerik con­stituency in Perak, died on Mon­day of a heart at­tack. He was 63.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, state law­maker Ma­nis Muka Mohd Darah, 65, from Parti Warisan Sabah, died. She rep­re­sented the Bu­gaya state seat.</p>
    <p>Un­der Malaysian law, a by-elec­tion must be held within 60 days, once Par­lia­ment or the state assem­bly has been in­formed of a seat va­cancy.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din, in his ad­dress over tele­vi­sion and on so­cial me­dia plat­forms, said the Cabi­net had dis­cussed post­pon­ing the Batu Sapi by-elec­tion in its meet­ing last Fri­day, and took into ac­count the spread of Covid-19 in Sabah fol­low­ing the state elec­tions on Sept 26.</p>
    <p>He said that fears among elec­tion work­ers of pos­si­ble ex­po­sure to the virus led to the Elec­tion Com­mis­sion man­ag­ing to ap­point only 143 work­ers so far, just 17.1 per cent of the num­ber needed for the by­elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The need for elec­tion work­ers to travel and pass through many dis­tricts, and the risk to 22.3 per cent of vot­ers who are se­nior cit­i­zens and there­fore vul­ner­a­ble to the dis­ease, were among some of the fac­tors which led to the de­ci­sion, he said.</p>
