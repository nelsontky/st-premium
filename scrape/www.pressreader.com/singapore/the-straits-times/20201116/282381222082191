    <p>Fi­nance will play a piv­otal role in tran­si­tion­ing Asia to­wards a more sus­tain­able fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Banks and fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions in the re­gion have been tak­ing the fight to cli­mate change through the pro­vi­sion of green fi­nance – whether in the form of green bonds or sus­tain­able lend­ing prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, China’s green bond mar­ket has grown rapidly from only three deals five years ago worth US$1.2 bil­lion to many mul­ti­ples of that num­ber last year, worth US$33.6 bil­lion</p>
    <p>(S$45.3 bil­lion), ac­cord­ing to data provider Dealogic.</p>
    <p>With en­vi­ron­men­tal, so­cial and gov­er­nance poli­cies gain­ing trac­tion in Asia, cen­tral banks, too, have lent their sup­port.</p>
    <p>In a sur­vey car­ried out last year by the South East Asian Cen­tral Banks Cen­tre, 94 per cent of re­spon­dents thought their in­sti­tu­tion should be play­ing a key role in pro­mot­ing green fi­nance and sus­tain­able fund­ing op­tions, in­clud­ing by amend­ing reg­u­la­tory frame­works.</p>
    <p>To en­sure sus­tain­abil­ity am­bi­tions can be pur­sued at pace, the fi­nan­cial sec­tor has a key role in pro­mot­ing greater aware­ness and adop­tion of tran­si­tion fi­nance – by guid­ing com­pa­nies and coun­tries with a tool­kit to set them on the right path to achieve their sus­tain­abil­ity pur­suits.</p>
    <p>The start­ing point for think­ing about tran­si­tion fi­nance is that not all in­dus­tries are mov­ing – nor can move – at the same pace to­wards a low-car­bon fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Ob­vi­ous ex­am­ples are sec­tors that are heav­ily re­liant on fos­sil fu­els – in­clud­ing oil and gas com­pa­nies, as well as air­lines and au­to­mo­tive firms.</p>
    <p>Tra­di­tional green fi­nance has hitherto not been ap­pli­ca­ble to the most pol­lut­ing in­dus­tries and, where com­pa­nies have made</p>
    <p>for­ays into green fi­nance – by is­su­ing green bonds, for in­stance – they have some­times been ac­cused of “green­wash­ing”.</p>
    <p>More­over, the un­der­ly­ing as­sets of green bonds re­late to cat­e­gories that still make up only a rel­a­tively small share of the over­all econ­omy – re­new­ables, mass tran­sit and green build­ings, for ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>Yet there is an ur­gent need for high-im­pact in­dus­tries to ac­cess fund­ing that will al­low them to adopt mech­a­nisms to be­come greener as part of a post-Covid-19 tran­si­tion.</p>
    <p>This is where tran­si­tion fi­nance comes in, al­low­ing com­pa­nies in pol­lut­ing sec­tors to adopt in­cre­men­tal so­lu­tions to be­come greener.</p>
    <p>A re­port in March by the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion’s tech­ni­cal ex­pert group on sus­tain­able fi­nance made clear the scale of the fund­ing chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing the Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and De­vel­op­ment’s es­ti­mates that</p>
    <p>glob­ally, €6.35 tril­lion</p>
    <p>(S$10.1 tril­lion) a year will be re­quired to meet Paris Agree­ment goals by 2030, the group warned that pub­lic sec­tor re­sources will not be ad­e­quate for the task, and mo­bil­i­sa­tion of in­sti­tu­tional and pri­vate cap­i­tal will be nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Fi­nance was “a crit­i­cal en­abler of trans­for­ma­tive im­prove­ments in ex­ist­ing in­dus­tries in Europe and glob­ally”.</p>
    <p>These dy­nam­ics have par­tic­u­lar rel­e­vance in Asia, where tran­si­tion is con­tex­tual. That is be­cause the tra­jec­tory of eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment is dif­fer­ent from that in most parts of the West.</p>
    <p>Both the Paris and Ky­oto cli­mate agree­ments recog­nised the prin­ci­ple of pro­por­tional re­spon­si­bil­ity: While all sig­na­tory na­tions made cli­mate pledges, the ex­tent of re­duc­tion is pro­por­tional to each coun­try’s pop­u­la­tion, eco­nomic cir­cum­stances and his­tor­i­cal con­tri­bu­tion to the high-car­bon con­cen­tra­tion in the at­mos­phere.</p>
    <p>This is not a cop-out.</p>
    <p>The ob­jec­tive is to reach net-zero by 2050 for the planet as a whole.</p>
    <p>Recog­ni­tion is needed that de­vel­op­ing mar­kets may need more time to make the tran­si­tion and that de­car­bon­is­ing pol­lut­ing sec­tors may be more com­plex.</p>
    <p>This is all the more rel­e­vant in the con­text of the so-called “just tran­si­tion”, un­der which there is an im­per­a­tive to en­sure an eq­ui­table exit from car­bon-in­ten­sive ac­tiv­i­ties so as to min­imise un­in­tended job losses or other so­cial dam­age.</p>
    <p>Tran­si­tion fi­nance now of­fers a way for com­pa­nies in Asia that are try­ing to de­car­bonise – but may strug­gle to adopt tra­di­tional green fi­nance so­lu­tions – to ac­cess the fund­ing needed to make progress.</p>
    <p>Key to this is a frame­work and stan­dards that al­low such com­pa­nies to tap sus­tain­able fi­nance with­out run­ning the risk of al­le­ga­tions of green­wash­ing, yet gives fi­nanciers clar­ity as to what they are fi­nanc­ing.</p>
    <p>At DBS Bank, we have in­cor­po­rated re­spon­si­ble fi­nanc­ing into the de­ci­sion-mak­ing process of our lend­ing and cap­i­tal mar­kets business since 2017.</p>
    <p>In June, the bank marked its am­bi­tion to be a first mover in re­gional sus­tain­able fi­nance by pub­lish­ing a Sus­tain­able and Tran­si­tion Fi­nance Frame­work and Tax­on­omy. This serves as a guide to fa­cil­i­tate the cat­e­gori­sa­tion, mon­i­tor­ing and re­port­ing of fi­nanc­ing of sus­tain­able ac­tiv­i­ties, and to en­gage with cus­tomers to adapt in the face of cli­mate change, re­source scarcity and in­come in­equal­ity.</p>
    <p>Our frame­work pro­vides a sci­ence-based ap­proach to avoid green­wash­ing; fa­cil­i­tates the ex­am­i­na­tion of the re­la­tion­ship be­tween an as­set or project’s na­ture (green, brown, tran­si­tion) and credit qual­ity; and pin­points po­ten­tial dif­fer­ences in how an eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity in­tended as a tran­si­tional so­lu­tion in Asia may dif­fer from more de­vel­oped mar­kets.</p>
    <p>It has also iden­ti­fied sev­eral eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties that can be la­belled as “tran­si­tion”, in­clud­ing im­prov­ing the en­ergy ef­fi­ciency of blast fur­naces in the smelt­ing in­dus­try; the de­vel­op­ment of new con­crete com­po­si­tions that re­sult in us­ing less ce­ment in con­struc­tion; the avoid­ance of green­house gas emis­sions in the an­i­mal feed in­dus­try; and im­proved ship de­sign, hull and propul­sion ef­fi­ciency in ship­ping.</p>
    <p>In de­vis­ing an ex­ten­sive tax­on­omy of eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties aligned with DBS’ sus­tain­able and tran­si­tion fi­nance la­bels, we see that tran­si­tion fi­nance will in­volve a big part of the real econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Smelt­ing of key met­als, for in­stance, is key to a fu­ture of bat­tery-pow­ered elec­tri­fi­ca­tion, as is use of nat­u­ral gas in lim­ited cir­cum­stances as a bridg­ing fuel.</p>
    <p>In short, we be­lieve tran­si­tion fi­nance of­fers a vi­able path­way for the scal­ing up of sus­tain­able fi­nance. Since 2018, DBS has done around 100 sus­tain­able fi­nance deals worth over $15 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>With Asia be­ing a man­u­fac­tur­ing base and the mar­ket that it is, tran­si­tion fi­nance of­fers scope to help the re­gion – and its trad­ing part­ners – hit their sus­tain­abil­ity tar­gets.</p>
    <p>The writer is the group head of in­sti­tu­tional bank­ing at DBS Bank.</p>
    <p>This is the first of a five-part se­ries on key trends that will shape the fu­ture of bank­ing.</p>
