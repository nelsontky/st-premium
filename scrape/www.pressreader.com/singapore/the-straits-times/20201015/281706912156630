    <p>Job seek­ers, both white- and bluecol­lar work­ers, can turn to ca­reer cen­tres set up in the Hous­ing Board heart­land to ac­cess the full va­ri­ety of va­can­cies that are avail­able in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>There are at least eight of these satel­lite ca­reer cen­tres in towns such as Jurong West, Sengkang and Wood­lands, and they come un­der the new SG United Jobs and Skills Pack­age in­tro­duced in May to help Sin­ga­pore­ans find jobs amid the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>Most of the job matches made via this pack­age have been for nonPMET (pro­fes­sional, man­age­rial, ex­ec­u­tive and tech­ni­cian) po­si­tions, said Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>She was re­ply­ing to Work­ers’ Party MP Ger­ald Giam (Alju­nied GRC), who had asked whether un­skilled job seek­ers can get help through other chan­nels be­sides SGUnited Jobs and Skills Cen­tres. He had said such cen­tres seemed to fo­cus on plac­ing PMETs.</p>
    <p>But Mrs Teo said: “Our ex­pe­ri­ence is that match­ing peo­ple to PMET jobs takes longer. It has ac­tu­ally been eas­ier to match peo­ple in non-PMET roles.”</p>
    <p>She added: “Right now, the fo­cus has to be on the com­pa­nies mak­ing these op­por­tu­ni­ties avail­able to job seek­ers, let­ting the job seek­ers know that they are in­ter­ested to take in peo­ple as trainees or for mid-ca­reer at­tach­ments.”</p>
    <p>Be­sides these satel­lite ca­reer cen­tres, work­ers hunt­ing for a job can also turn to other “touch points” with a sim­i­larly com­pre­hen­sive list of va­can­cies avail­able at com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>These touch points in­clude the Na­tional Trades Union Congress’ Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute’s five per­ma­nent ca­reer cen­tres and Work­force Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The SG United Jobs and Skills Pack­age was an­nounced by Deputy Prime Min­is­ter and Fi­nance Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat in May when he un­veiled the fourth Bud­get for Sin­ga­pore to help over­come the up­heavals of Covid-19. The pack­age was aimed at cre­at­ing job op­por­tu­ni­ties for work­ers hit by the eco­nomic fall­out from the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo told the House that her min­istry is also work­ing with trade as­so­ci­a­tions and busi­ness cham­bers of com­merce as well as the Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion to match peo­ple and jobs. The fed­er­a­tion is main­tain­ing the list of ap­proved com­pa­nies with va­can­cies.</p>
    <p>She added that her min­istry is fol­low­ing up closely with com­pa­nies that have of­fered trainee­ships to un­der­stand their con­cerns on con­vert­ing at­tach­ments to per­ma­nent jobs.</p>
    <p>“A lot of com­pa­nies are look­ing ahead and see­ing that this is a good time to ex­pose more job seek­ers to their in­dus­tries or to the jobs that were pre­vi­ously less well sought af­ter, she added, in her re­ply to Ms Car­rie Tan (Nee Soon GRC) and Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang).</p>
    <p>She noted that in de­cid­ing to fill a per­ma­nent po­si­tion, com­pa­nies will, among other things, look at whether the trainee has “ex­hib­ited good abil­ity to gel with the team as well as to con­trib­ute to the or­gan­i­sa­tion”.</p>
    <p>One way the Gov­ern­ment is nudg­ing em­ploy­ers to hire lo­cal work­ers is through the Jobs Growth In­cen­tive (JGI). Un­der the scheme, firms that hire more locals in the six months start­ing last month could get up to $15,000 for each worker aged be­low 40 and up to $30,000 for each worker aged 40 and older.</p>
    <p>Be­sides this as­sur­ance of fund­ing sup­port for their new hires, com­pa­nies also have to make an ef­fort to keep their ex­ist­ing em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said that pay­outs aimed at speed­ing up the hir­ing of lo­cal work­ers are re­duced in pro­por­tion to the num­ber of ex­ist­ing em­ploy­ees that left the com­pany af­ter the scheme started last month.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies must also raise the num­ber of lo­cal em­ploy­ees in jobs that pay at least $1,400 in gross monthly wages, she added.</p>
