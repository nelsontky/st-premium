    <p>Sev­eral Sin­ga­porean stu­dents study­ing in the United Kingdom scram­bled to change their flights there yes­ter­day to en­sure they would not have to spend time in quar­an­tine upon ar­rival.</p>
    <p>This was due to Thurs­day’s an­nounce­ment that from 4am this morn­ing, those ar­riv­ing in Eng­land and Scot­land from Sin­ga­pore will no longer need to self-iso­late for 14 days af­ter land­ing.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers from Sin­ga­pore and Thai­land have now been added to the UK’s travel cor­ri­dor list, mean­ing they do not have to en­ter quar­an­tine if they have not been in or tran­sited through any other nonex­empt coun­tries in the 14 days pre­ced­ing their ar­rival.</p>
    <p>Ms Yang Xin, 22, a third-year med­i­cal stu­dent at Ox­ford Univer­sity, changed her Sin­ga­pore Air­lines flight to the UK from one sched­uled to de­part at 9am yes­ter­day to one on Sept 26, upon hear­ing the news.</p>
    <p>Ms Yang, who has to sit an ex­am­i­na­tion on Oct 2, said she was glad to hear that she would not have to be quar­an­tined. “My col­lege charges more than £24 (S$42) per day (for quar­an­tine ac­com­mo­da­tion) and food isn’t pro­vided, so it would have been a mas­sive headache try­ing to set­tle food for 14 days.”</p>
    <p>Lon­don School of Eco­nomics stu­dent Cor­nelius Chong, 21, was sched­uled to ar­rive in Bri­tain at 6am to­day, nar­rowly miss­ing hav­ing to serve quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>School for him will start on Sept 28, but he said that he had ar­ranged to ar­rive much ear­lier to serve the self-iso­la­tion pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Mr Chong said yes­ter­day: “This news of not hav­ing to serve a stay­home no­tice is def­i­nitely a pleas­ant sur­prise. I will have more time to adapt to the new en­vi­ron­ment there.”</p>
    <p>But he noted that this “def­i­nitely does not mean that we should let our guard down when we go out”.</p>
    <p>“The usual mask wear­ing, hand hy­giene and not be­ing in crowded places will def­i­nitely be even more im­por­tant since reg­u­la­tions in the UK are un­likely to be as strict as Sin­ga­pore’s, and we will need to take our own pre­cau­tions or risk get­ting in­fected,” he said.</p>
    <p>Some stu­dents said the lift­ing of quar­an­tine re­quire­ments would not have had a bear­ing on their cho­sen date of re­turn to the UK.</p>
    <p>Ms Clara Tan, 21, a third-year law stu­dent at Ox­ford Univer­sity, will be fly­ing over on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>She said she is “fa­tigued” from the un­cer­tainty sur­round­ing Covid-19. She has al­ready served three 14-day quar­an­tine pe­ri­ods in Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong, but said she “han­dles them pretty well”.</p>
    <p>“The an­nounce­ment was cer­tainly un­ex­pected, but that is just the way things are these days.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally didn’t feel like mak­ing yet an­other change to my plans be­cause of some new change with the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion,” she said. Her col­lege also in­tended to give stu­dents free ac­com­mo­da­tion dur­ing the quar­an­tine pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers who do not self-iso­late as re­quired can be fined £1,000 in Eng­land, Wales and North­ern Ire­land, and £480 in Scot­land.</p>
    <p>Travel agency Dy­nasty Travel said that for now, only stu­dents are trav­el­ling back to Eng­land be­fore their semesters start later this month.</p>
    <p>“Some leisure trav­ellers are keen to travel, but they still have reserva</p>
    <p>My col­lege charges more than £24 (S$42) per day (for quar­an­tine ac­com­mo­da­tion) and food isn’t pro­vided, so it would have been a mas­sive headache try­ing to set­tle food for 14 days.</p>
    <p>MS YANG XIN, med­i­cal stu­dent at Ox­ford Univer­sity who has changed her flight to Sept 26. PLEAS­ANT SUR­PRISE</p>
    <p>This news of not hav­ing to serve a stay-home no­tice is def­i­nitely a pleas­ant sur­prise. I will have more time to adapt to the new en­vi­ron­ment there.</p>
    <p>MR COR­NELIUS CHONG, Lon­don School of Eco­nomics stu­dent, who will nar­rowly miss hav­ing to serve quar­an­tine. UN­CER­TAIN TIMES</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment was cer­tainly un­ex­pected, but that is just the way things are these days.</p>
    <p>MS CLARA TAN, law stu­dent at Ox­ford Univer­sity who has al­ready served three 14-day quar­an­tine pe­ri­ods in Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong. She will be leav­ing for the UK on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>tions and (are) cau­tious about po­ten­tial risks,” said its direc­tor of public re­la­tions and com­mu­ni­ca­tions Ali­cia Seah.</p>
    <p>She noted that mu­tual agree­ments and stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures are in place to en­sure the safety of trav­ellers.</p>
