    <p>Mr Mu­rali Pil­lai (Bukit Ba­tok) (right) has pro­posed that Par­lia­ment in­vest in a new IT sys­tem that tracks the num­ber of par­lia­men­tary ques­tions raised by an MP as well as the at­ten­dance record for sit­tings.</p>
    <p>Such in­for­ma­tion would make it eas­ier for peo­ple to hold MPs to ac­count, he said yes­ter­day dur­ing the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress.</p>
    <p>This in­for­ma­tion is al­ready pub­lic and can be ob­tained to­day, but not with­out some ef­fort, in­clud­ing man­ual count­ing, he said.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Mu­rali: “I urge such records to be avail­able more eas­ily with an on­line search plat­form.”</p>
    <p>The pro­posal is among sev­eral he made to im­prove par­lia­men­tary pro­cesses, as part of his call for in­creased con­sen­sus among MPs for a more sta­ble and ma­ture democ­racy.</p>
    <p>An­other of his ideas is to es­tab­lish a par­lia­men­tary record of the out­come of MPs’ pro­pos­als that min­is­ters had agreed to study.</p>
    <p>He said: “The Hansard is re­plete with ex­am­ples of front­benchers pro­vid­ing hold­ing replies with­out the abil­ity to check if there are any up­dates. Mem­bers of the pub­lic read­ing the Hansard will not be able to tell if the loop has been closed.”</p>
    <p>The Hansard is a writ­ten record of all par­lia­men­tary pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>Mr Mu­rali said: “We should also en­trench a practice of ex­pressly ac­knowl­edg­ing MPs in Par­lia­ment, should their pro­pos­als be ac­cepted by the Gov­ern­ment. This, too, should be ac­ces­si­ble by mem­bers of pub­lic.”</p>
    <p>An­other sug­ges­tion he made is for Par­lia­ment to pro­vide the op­tion of tak­ing an MP’s speech as read and to be made pub­lic.</p>
    <p>This, he added, would boost the ef­fi­ciency of the process, so that time in the House is spent on genuine de­bate and points of clar­i­fi­ca­tion or dis­agree­ment.</p>
    <p>This would also avoid rep­e­ti­tion of points, which is time-wast­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Mu­rali said: “The minister should feel free to be­rate mem­bers who try to de­bate with­out hav­ing read the speech.” The de­bate dur­ing the sec­ond read­ing of pro­posed leg­is­la­tions is now com­prised largely of MPs read­ing out their speeches when their turn comes, with lit­tle time to re­act to what was said by oth­ers, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Mu­rali also called for the civil</p>
    <p>Vot­ers are ma­tur­ing, more de­mand­ing, and very rightly so, in terms of what they can and should ex­pect from all of us in this House. They are also dis­cern­ing, at­ten­tive, ra­tio­nal and fair. They hold all of us up to high standards and see be­yond po­lit­i­cal colours to the real im­pact we make in their lives.</p>
    <p>ser­vice to pub­lish and present a pa­per in Par­lia­ment reg­u­larly, with de­tails such as the num­ber of let­ters the civil ser­vice and statu­tory boards re­ceive from MPs pe­ti­tion­ing on be­half of their con­stituents.</p>
    <p>The pa­per should in­di­cate if the sub­stan­tive re­sponse to the MP was within the time pe­riod stip­u­lated in the Gov­ern­ment In­struc­tion Man­ual, which spec­i­fies poli­cies, standards, reg­u­la­tions and codes of practice.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Mu­rali: “Vot­ers are ma­tur­ing, more de­mand­ing, and very rightly so, in terms of what they can and should ex­pect from all of us in this House. They are also dis­cern­ing, at­ten­tive, ra­tio­nal and fair. They hold all of us up to high standards and see be­yond po­lit­i­cal colours to the real im­pact we make in their lives.”</p>
    <p>His pro­pos­als, Mr Mu­rali said, will help en­sure con­stituents have ac­cess to in­for­ma­tion, to make in­formed po­lit­i­cal choices and de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>“Through this process, it would then be eas­ier to assess the full di­ver­sity of views ex­pressed by all MPs, as­cer­tain, as a mat­ter of record, where the con­sen­sus lies and the points of dis­agree­ment, if any.</p>
    <p>“This will also hold MPs to ac­count, and for our con­stituents to see if we do in­deed put in our time and at­ten­tion to par­lia­men­tary matters, or whether we are sim­ply go­ing through the mo­tions.”</p>
