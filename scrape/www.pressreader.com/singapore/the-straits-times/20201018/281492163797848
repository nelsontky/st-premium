    <p>Bri­tish bil­lion­aire in­ven­tor James Dyson’s blade­less fans and cord­less vac­uum clean­ers have taken the world, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, by storm.</p>
    <p>Hence, when he an­nounced that he had started build­ing an elec­tric car in 2017, it was keenly an­tic­i­pated.</p>
    <p>That was un­til he slammed the brakes on the pro­ject last year, af­ter hav­ing spent £500 mil­lion (S$878 mil­lion) of his own money to build the car, which he refers to as the N526.</p>
    <p>If all had gone to plan, the elec­tric car plant was to have run in Sin­ga­pore by next year, but Mr Dyson took the fail­ure in his stride.</p>
    <p>He told staff in an e-mail that al­though the engi­neers had de­vel­oped a “fan­tas­tic elec­tric car”, it would not hit the roads be­cause it was not “com­mer­cially vi­able”.</p>
    <p>“There’s huge sad­ness and dis­ap­point­ment,” the en­tre­pre­neur had said. “Ours is a life of risk and of fail­ure. We try things and they fail.”</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with The Sun­day Times, the 73-year-old stressed that fail­ure is of­ten a path­way to suc­cess, and that he has no re­grets over at­tempt­ing to build an elec­tric car.</p>
    <p>In fact, it re­sulted in some gains for the tech­nol­ogy com­pany, which moved its global head­quar­ters to Sin­ga­pore in 2018.</p>
    <p>Dyson, whose his­tory here be­gan 14 years ago with a small engi­neer­ing team de­vel­op­ing high-speed elec­tric mo­tors, said it chose to po­si­tion its global head­quar­ters here be­cause of the coun­try’s ex­per­tise in ad­vanced man­u­fac­tur­ing, as well as global and re­gional con­nec­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Dyson, who cur­rently em­ploys 1,200 peo­ple here, main­tains that Sin­ga­pore and the new head­quar­ters in the iconic St James Power Sta­tion will be at the cen­tre of his firm’s growth plans, which in­clude re­search, de­vel­op­ment and the man­u­fac­ture of new tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>Q Can you elab­o­rate on why you de­cided to pull out of the elec­tric car pro­ject?</p>
    <p>A The prob­lem was that dur­ing the three or four years that we were de­vel­op­ing the car, we got to a point where we re­alised that it is very, very dif­fi­cult to make money out of elec­tric cars at the mo­ment.</p>
    <p>And that is partly be­cause elec­tric cars are more ex­pen­sive to make than in­ter­nal com­bus­tion en­gine cars but, also, ex­ist­ing car man­u­fac­tur­ers which are mak­ing elec­tric cars are all los­ing money on them.</p>
    <p>So they can have an elec­tric car at one end that loses money, but it bal­ances off the emis­sions of a large SUV on the other end of the spec­trum of their fleet, on which they make a lot of money.</p>
    <p>So, al­though we had a great car... whether or not it would make money was doubt­ful. As a rel­a­tively small pri­vate com­pany, I sim­ply could not af­ford to take that risk.</p>
    <p>Q You dropped the pro­ject, yet you say that you gained from it and have growth plans for Sin­ga­pore. What did you gain from it and what are your plans for Sin­ga­pore?</p>
    <p>A Sin­ga­pore is a won­der­ful place for us to re­search, de­velop and man­u­fac­ture new tech­nolo­gies, and we are driv­ing for­ward with im­por­tant re­search here in soft­ware, elec­tron­ics, ro­bot­ics, en­ergy and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence – to name a few.</p>
    <p>You have some of the best univer­si­ties in the world, and some of the bright­est engi­neers and sci­en­tists – we have hired 150 of them this year.</p>
    <p>Im­por­tantly, the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment un­der­stands the value that engi­neers bring to so­ci­ety and the in­ge­nu­ity that they bring to an econ­omy.</p>
    <p>It should come as no sur­prise then that we are deep­en­ing our roots in Sin­ga­pore, and St James Power Sta­tion, which is cur­rently un­der­go­ing sen­si­tive restora­tion, will sit at the cen­tre of that.</p>
    <p>Our engi­neers and I loved build­ing the elec­tric car. It was a re­ally in­ter­est­ing thing to do – we learnt a lot.</p>
    <p>Dyson is now fo­cus­ing its ef­forts on de­vel­op­ing the bat­tery tech­nol­ogy and other tech­nolo­gies from the car pro­ject, which we hope will take us in ex­cit­ing new di­rec­tions.</p>
    <p>We also found some won­der­ful peo­ple, engi­neer­ing tal­ents, through the pro­ject, in­clud­ing in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The other point is that, we bought and ren­o­vated an air­field in Hullav­ing­ton (in Bri­tain) as our base for de­vel­op­ing the car. There are some beau­ti­ful hangars on the air­field, which we have taken great care to re­store, cher­ish and con­vert into pro­duc­tive R&D ar­eas.</p>
    <p>We will now be able to ex­pand the rest of our projects in that area – which in­ci­den­tally was where we de­vel­oped the emer­gency Covid-19 ven­ti­la­tor for the UK gov­ern­ment at the height of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>So, yes, it is bet­ter to have done that and to have failed, than to not have tried at all.</p>
    <p>Q Even if it is a mad­cap idea and doesn’t look like it will work out?</p>
    <p>A I am a great be­liever in try­ing out things, even if it is a mad­cap idea. You will learn from it. And then when you do the next mad­cap thing, you are a lit­tle bit wiser.</p>
    <p>When I was build­ing my vac­uum (cleaner), ev­ery­one told me not to chal­lenge Hoover and Elec­trolux – that it is an im­pos­si­ble thing to do.</p>
    <p>Every­body told me that I could not take on the Pana­son­ics of this world, and now I have done it.</p>
    <p>But I have had lots of fail­ures in my life from which I have painfully learnt from.</p>
    <p>Q It seems you saw gi­ant cy­clones re­mov­ing wood dust from a sawmill which gave you the idea for your cel­e­brated vac­uum cleaner. But the process to minia­turise the de­vice to fit in­side a vac­uum cleaner took no fewer than 5,127 pro­to­types.</p>
    <p>A Yes, I spent five years cre­at­ing 5,127 ver­sions that failed be­fore I made one that worked.</p>
    <p>When you have a fail­ure, you try and un­der­stand why it failed. Fail­ure is part of the de­sign process.</p>
    <p>You tend not to do that with suc­cesses. You would say ‘thank God it works’, and so it does not present a prob­lem.</p>
    <p>So al­though I have 5,127 pro­to­types – that sounds fright­fully te­dious, dispir­it­ing – in fact, it is the com­plete op­po­site. It is a fas­ci­nat­ing part of dis­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Q How do you build this cul­ture of risk tak­ing and em­brac­ing fail­ure into the ed­u­ca­tion of an en­gi­neer?</p>
    <p>A You do not have to try that hard with engi­neers. They want to solve prob­lems. Their nat­u­ral in­cli­na­tion, once they start do­ing what­ever they are do­ing, is want­ing to find a so­lu­tion – to make their idea work.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem is that so­ci­ety de­spises fail­ure. Our ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem de­spises fail­ure. We ap­plaud the per­son who gets the an­swer right and gets the an­swer right very quickly.</p>
    <p>And it is im­por­tant in some fields in life, but in a lot of other fields, it is not nec­es­sar­ily that im­por­tant to get the an­swer right the first time – to have failed, to ex­per­i­ment, to have done dif­fer­ent things.</p>
    <p>There’s huge sad­ness and dis­ap­point­ment... Ours is a life of risk and of fail­ure. We try things and they fail.</p>
    <p>BRI­TISH BIL­LION­AIRE IN­VEN­TOR JAMES DYSON, on chas­ing dreams.</p>
    <p>Q So how do we change that?</p>
    <p>A Well it is an at­ti­tude thing, is it not? We all ad­mire and as­pire to aca­demic bril­liance. It is what our teach­ers tell us, it is what our par­ents want from us, but it is not how real life works.</p>
    <p>Q What has your ex­pe­ri­ence been in hir­ing engi­neers in Sin­ga­pore?</p>
    <p>A There is won­der­ful engi­neer­ing tal­ent in Sin­ga­pore – in fact we have taken on more than 100 new engi­neers al­ready this year alone.</p>
    <p>And we want Sin­ga­pore to be a real cen­tre to ri­val our in­ven­tion cen­tre, re­search cen­tre in Malmes­bury.</p>
    <p>And we are al­ready work­ing on some very in­ter­est­ing re­search projects which I can­not talk about be­cause they are top se­cret.</p>
    <p>You know it is one of the rea­sons we put our head of­fice in Sin­ga­pore. It is to take ad­van­tage of the won­der­ful univer­si­ties and tal­ent that there are in Sin­ga­pore. And the en­thu­si­asm for engi­neer­ing and science from the stu­dents, and from the Gov­ern­ment, most im­por­tantly.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Mr James Dyson said he canned the pro&#xAD;ject to build an elec&#xAD;tric car be&#xAD;cause he was not cer&#xAD;tain that he could make money from it. But the work that went into the car has not gone to waste be&#xAD;cause some as&#xAD;pects &#x2013; such as the bat&#xAD;tery tech&#xAD;nol&#xAD;ogy &#x2013; can be har&#xAD;nessed to pro&#xAD;pel other new, com&#xAD;mer&#xAD;cial pur&#xAD;suits.
