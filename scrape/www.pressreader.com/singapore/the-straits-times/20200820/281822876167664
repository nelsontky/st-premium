    <p>WELLING­TON • New Zealand said it would in­crease the num­ber of de­fence per­son­nel at its quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties and bor­der to beat any fur­ther spread of Covid-19, as it re­ported five new cases in the com­mu­nity yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Around 500 more de­fence per­son­nel will be de­ployed, tak­ing the to­tal de­fence force per­son­nel sup­port­ing the Covid-19 re­sponse to around 1,200 – the largest mil­i­tary con­tin­gent since New Zealand sent peace­keep­ers to Ti­mor-Leste dur­ing un­rest there in the early 2000s, the govern­ment said.</p>
    <p>“There’s noth­ing to date that has tracked this par­tic­u­lar clus­ter we are deal­ing with to the bor­der, but none­the­less we want that to be as tight as pos­si­ble,” New Zealand Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern said at a news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>New Zealand had five new cases in the com­mu­nity in the last 24 hours, fall­ing from 13 cases on Tues­day. Ms Ardern said this showed the coun­try was not see­ing a surge of Covid-19 in the com­mu­nity. “The roll­out of our resur­gence plan is work­ing as we in­tended,” she said, adding that she has no in­ten­tion to raise the level of re­stric­tions in Auck­land.</p>
    <p>New Zealand has fared far bet­ter than most coun­tries dur­ing the pan­demic, but an abrupt resur­gence of Covid-19 last week in Auck­land prompted the govern­ment to en­force an alert level 3 lock­down on the city’s 1.7 mil­lion res­i­dents un­til Aug 26, while so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules are in place in other towns and cities.</p>
    <p>Un­der level 3, busi­nesses are re­quired to im­ple­ment Covid-19 safety mea­sures, most peo­ple are en­cour­aged to work from home and school­child­ren learn from home.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has had 1,649 cases and 22 deaths.</p>
    <p>The ori­gin of the lat­est out­break is still un­known, but the au­thor­i­ties have ruled out the pos­si­bil­ity that it came from frozen foods or freight.</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern de­layed the coun­try’s gen­eral elec­tion by a month ear­lier this week, bow­ing to pres­sure from par­ties who com­plained they could not cam­paign with nearly a third of New Zealand’s 5 mil­lion peo­ple un­der lock­down in Auck­land.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, a court found the first nine days of a hard lock­down put in place by the govern­ment ear­lier this year re­quir­ing peo­ple to iso­late at home was jus­ti­fied, but un­law­ful.</p>
    <p>The rul­ing comes after Welling­ton lawyer An­drew Bor­row­dale chal­lenged the le­gal­ity of steps taken in the early stages of the five­week lock­down, in­clud­ing calls by Ms Ardern and other of­fi­cials be­tween March 26 and April 3 telling New Zealan­ders to stay at home.</p>
    <p>An or­der on stay-at-home re­stric­tions was not passed un­til April 3, so New Zealan­ders’ rights and free­doms were un­law­fully lim­ited for those nine days, the court said. “While there is no ques­tion that the re­quire­ment was a nec­es­sary, rea­son­able and pro­por­tion­ate re­sponse to the Covid-19 cri­sis at that time, the re­quire­ment was not pre­scribed by law,” it said.</p>
    <p>All other chal­lenges to the lock­down were dis­missed.</p>
    <p>“The govern­ment was try­ing to ed­u­cate peo­ple about the health risks and tran­si­tion them quickly to take ac­tions that cur­tailed nor­mal free­doms like stay­ing at home to stop the spread of the virus,” At­tor­ney-Gen­eral David Parker said after the rul­ing. “In the end, the mea­sures taken by the govern­ment worked to elim­i­nate Covid-19, save lives and min­imise dam­age to our econ­omy.”</p>
