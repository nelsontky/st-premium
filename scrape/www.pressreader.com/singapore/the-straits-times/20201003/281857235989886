    <p>One of the more in­ter­est­ing as­pects of the data col­lec­tion process was dis­cov­er­ing the stag­ger­ing amount of mis­in­for­ma­tion cov­er­age di­rectly linked to the pub­lic com­ments of a small num­ber of in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>MR JOR­DAN ADAMS, the study’s co-au­thor and a data an­a­lyst at Ci­sion In­sights, which pro­vided the data­base.</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has been the world’s big­gest driver of Covid-19 mis­in­for­ma­tion dur­ing the pan­demic, a study from Cor­nell Univer­sity said on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>A team from the Cor­nell Al­liance for Sci­ence eval­u­ated 38 mil­lion ar­ti­cles pub­lished by English-lan­guage, tra­di­tional me­dia world­wide be­tween Jan 1 and May 26.</p>
    <p>The data­base they used ag­gre­gates cov­er­age from coun­tries such as the United States, Bri­tain, In­dia, Ire­land, Aus­tralia and New Zealand, as well as other African and Asian na­tions.</p>
    <p>They iden­ti­fied 522,472 news ar­ti­cles that re­pro­duced or am­pli­fied mis­in­for­ma­tion re­lated to the Covid-19 pan­demic, or what the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion has called the “in­fo­demic”.</p>
    <p>These were cat­e­gorised into 11 main sub-top­ics, rang­ing from con­spir­acy the­o­ries to at­tacks on top US in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert An­thony Fauci.</p>
    <p>But the most pop­u­lar topic by far was what the study au­thors termed “mir­a­cle cures”, which ap­peared in 295,351 ar­ti­cles – more than the other 10 top­ics com­bined.</p>
    <p>The au­thors found that com­ments by Mr Trump drove ma­jor spikes in the “mir­a­cle cures” topic, led by his April 24 press brief­ing where he mused on the pos­si­bil­ity of us­ing dis­in­fec­tants in­side the body to cure the dis­ease. Sim­i­lar spikes were seen when he pro­moted un­proven treat­ments like hy­drox­y­chloro­quine.</p>
    <p>“We con­clude there­fore that the pres­i­dent of the United States was likely the largest driver of the Covid-19 mis­in­for­ma­tion ‘ in­fo­demic’,” the team wrote.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Sarah Evanega, who led the study and is di­rec­tor of the Cor­nell Al­liance for Sci­ence, said: “If peo­ple are mis­led by un­sci­en­tific and un­sub­stan­ti­ated claims about the dis­ease, they may be less likely to ob­serve of­fi­cial guid­ance and thus risk spread­ing the virus.”</p>
    <p>Co-au­thor Jor­dan Adams, a data an­a­lyst at Ci­sion In­sights, which pro­vided the data­base, added: “One of the more in­ter­est­ing as­pects of the data col­lec­tion process was dis­cov­er­ing the stag­ger­ing amount of mis­in­for­ma­tion cov­er­age di­rectly linked to the pub­lic com­ments of a small num­ber of in­di­vid­u­als.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter mir­a­cle cures, the sec­ond most preva­lent mis­in­for­ma­tion topic was that the pan­demic was cre­ated to advance a “new world or­der”. Next came the claim that the pan­demic was a hoax for po­lit­i­cal gain by the US Demo­cratic Party, fol­lowed by con­spir­a­cies al­leg­ing the virus was a bioweapon re­leased by a lab­o­ra­tory in Wuhan in cen­tral China, where the out­break orig­i­nated.</p>
    <p>Con­spir­acy the­o­ries link­ing the pan­demic to phi­lan­thropist Bill Gates came next, then the hoax that Covid-19 symp­toms are caused by 5G phone net­works, anti-Semitic con­spir­acy the­o­ries and the no­tion that the virus is a form of pop­u­la­tion con­trol.</p>
    <p>At­tacks on Dr Fauci, ref­er­ences to the de­bunked “Plan­demic” video and blam­ing the virus on Chi­nese peo­ple con­sum­ing bat soup rounded off the list.</p>
    <p>The study’s au­thors found there was some ef­fort to cor­rect the mis­in­for­ma­tion in the form of fact-check­ing ar­ti­cles, which ap­peared 183,717 times. They also tracked how the sto­ries were shared on so­cial me­dia, find­ing that the posts elicited 36 mil­lion en­gage­ments, three-quar­ters of them on Face­book.</p>
    <p>The re­search was partly funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foun­da­tion.</p>
