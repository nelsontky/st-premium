    <p>A knife at­tack at a su­per­mar­ket in Boon Lay Shop­ping Cen­tre yes­ter­day af­ter­noon left a 23-year-old man with in­juries to his head and face.</p>
    <p>Posts on on­line fo­rums Red­dit and Hard­wareZone showed long trails of blood stain­ing the floor and shelves at the Fair­Price out­let in the mall.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to ac­counts posted on­line, at least two men were in­volved in the slash­ing in­ci­dent, which left one of them with a deep di­ag­o­nal cut across his fore­head.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said they were alerted to the in­ci­dent at 12.40pm.</p>
    <p>A po­lice spokesman said: “A 23-year-old man was at­tacked by an­other man with a knife. The 23-year-old man suf­fered in­juries to his face and head and was con­scious when con­veyed to Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal. Po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing.”</p>
    <p>An 18-year-old man has been ar­rested.</p>
    <p>A Boon Lay res­i­dent in his 40s who was shop­ping at Fair­Price at the time said he heard “loud shout­ing” from a few aisles down.</p>
    <p>The man, who de­clined to be named, said he then saw a young man cov­ered in blood when he rounded the su­per­mar­ket aisle.</p>
    <p>“It was so scary – there was blood ev­ery­where,” he said.</p>
    <p>An­other res­i­dent in her 60s, who was at Fair­Price at around 12.50pm, said she saw three or four Fair­Price staff at­tempt­ing to help the blood­ied man sit up.</p>
    <p>“He was bleed­ing from his head and hands. It was re­ally hor­ri­fy­ing be­cause the blood was drip­ping from his mouth too,” said the res­i­dent, who wanted to be known as Madam Low.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that the Fair­Price out­let was closed for sev­eral hours af­ter the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>“We are aware of the in­ci­dent that took place out­side our store at Block 221 Boon Lay Place on Oct 7, 2020, at about 12.40pm,” said a Fair­Price spokesman.</p>
    <p>“Our staff ren­dered im­me­di­ate as­sis­tance and en­sured that the safety of our shop­pers was not com­pro­mised. Our store oper­a­tions re­main unaf­fected.”</p>
    <p>HOR­RI­FY­ING SIGHT</p>
    <p>He was bleed­ing from his head and hands. It was re­ally hor­ri­fy­ing be­cause the blood was drip­ping from his mouth too.</p>
