    <p>They had a happy fam­ily with two young chil­dren but tragedy struck one day when the cou­ple were killed in an ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>It was a dou­ble blow for the kids – they not only lost both par­ents but they also had no one to fend for them legally be­cause their par­ents died with­out leav­ing a will. This left the is­sue of the chil­dren’s guardian­ship in limbo.</p>
    <p>As they were mi­nors, the chil­dren could not even get some­one to help to ap­ply for a court order to en­sure that their par­ents’ as­sets or sav­ings were prop­erly trans­ferred or used to take care of them.</p>
    <p>To make mat­ters worse, fam­ily mem­bers of the dead cou­ple did not see eye to eye on who should take care of the kids. In such cir­cum­stances, chil­dren could end up be­ing moved from one home to another, caus­ing them more grief.</p>
    <p>This is one of the heart­break­ing cases that the So­ci­ety of Trust and Es­tate Prac­ti­tion­ers (Step), a global as­so­ci­a­tion for pro­fes­sion­als spe­cial­is­ing in fam­ily in­her­i­tance and suc­ces­sion plan­ning, have en­coun­tered in which some­one dies with­out a will.</p>
    <p>Step re­cently con­ducted a sur­vey to find out how pre­pared adults here are when it comes to end-oflife mat­ters.</p>
    <p>The re­sults show that there is still much im­prove­ment needed.</p>
    <p>MOST HAVE NO WILLS</p>
    <p>The poll found that 56 per cent of adult Sin­ga­pore­ans did not have a will. This re­sult is close to CPF Board’s own sta­tis­tics that about 60 per cent of el­i­gi­ble mem­bers have yet to nom­i­nate any ben­e­fi­ciary for their money.</p>
    <p>Even among those who said they made wills, only 14 per cent had one that was up to date. Many of the rest ei­ther had wills that did not prop­erly ex­press their wishes or had ones that were still be­ing worked out be­cause they had not had any dis­cus­sion with spouses or fam­ily mem­bers.</p>
    <p>And only a quar­ter of Sin­ga­pore­ans with young kids had nom­i­nated guardians for their chil­dren should they meet with a sud­den death.</p>
    <p>This lapse was even found among par­ents who had made wills: They gave only di­rec­tion on their wealth dis­tri­bu­tion and about 66 per cent of such wills made no men­tion of the guardian­ship of their kids, thus putting them at risk of dis­putes and fos­ter care.</p>
    <p>MANY UN­PRE­PARED FOR SUD­DEN IN­CA­PAC­ITY</p>
    <p>Only 10 per cent of adults polled said they had a last­ing power of at­tor­ney (LPA), which would al­low the ap­point­ment of a le­gal rep­re­sen­ta­tive to help man­age their wealth in case they lose their men­tal aware­ness due to old age, ill­nesses or ac­ci­dents.</p>
    <p>In­deed, the gen­eral aware­ness on why an LPA is needed is quite poor, even for those who say they have made pro­vi­sions, with around 30 per cent say­ing they were un­sure when it would come into force.</p>
    <p>The LPA is a le­gal doc­u­ment that al­lows you to ap­point one or more trusted peo­ple who will act on your be­half based on your spe­cific in­struc­tions or for your gen­eral in­ter­ests should you lose your men­tal ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>This is es­pe­cially crit­i­cal if you own a busi­ness and have spe­cific plans. Your LPA rep­re­sen­ta­tive will en­sure that your wishes are car­ried out when you are un­able to do so.</p>
    <p>The Step sur­vey re­vealed that over 60 per cent of peo­ple who own busi­nesses have yet to set a suc­ces­sion plan.</p>
    <p>It is com­mon for peo­ple to pro­cras­ti­nate and not think about endof-life mat­ters, es­pe­cially when they are busy work­ing.</p>
    <p>But Step Sin­ga­pore chair­man Sim</p>
    <p>Bock Eng says it is use­ful to pause and pon­der on things that are more im­por­tant in life.</p>
    <p>“We put in a lot of time and ef­fort to build our wealth and even more time and at­ten­tion to take care of our loved ones in our lifetime.</p>
    <p>“It is im­por­tant that our ef­forts are not wasted, sim­ply by fail­ing to plan how our loved ones and our wealth will be taken care of when we are not around.</p>
    <p>“Just as we rush to pur­chase an en­dow­ment or ed­u­ca­tion policy with the birth of each child, we should think about our own suc­ces­sion with each mile­stone in our life,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Sim, a sea­soned lawyer who is also WongPart­ner­ship’s head of the spe­cial­ist and pri­vate client dis­putes prac­tice, has seen enough fam­i­lies torn apart or fall into hard­ship when the heads die with­out a will.</p>
    <p>Here are some dis­putes that have ended up in le­gal bat­tles.</p>
    <p>FAM­I­LIES FIGHT OVER AS­SETS</p>
    <p>It is com­mon for sib­lings to fight over their par­ents’ as­sets but in some cases, they even fight over who has the right to deal with these as­sets.</p>
    <p>In one case, a man died with­out a will, so his as­sets were be di­vided equally among all his chil­dren, but they fought over who should be the le­gal rep­re­sen­ta­tive of the es­tate.</p>
    <p>This was ul­ti­mately de­cided by the court in a con­tentious hear­ing.</p>
    <p>The ap­pli­ca­tion for this order also took a few years as the court re­quired all the ben­e­fi­cia­ries to give their con­sent and some of them re­fused to.</p>
    <p>In another case, a woman had been cared for by her step-sis­ter for sev­eral years un­til her death from a long ill­ness. As she died with­out a will, her home and all her as­sets went to her three di­rect sib­lings even though she had not had any con­tact with them for over 10 years.</p>
    <p>The In­tes­tate Suc­ces­sion Act states that only full sib­lings had the rights to share the dead per­son’s as­sets and so the step-sis­ter got noth­ing even though she was her clos­est kin in life.</p>
    <p>NO LE­GAL IN­STRUC­TION CAN MEAN LOSSES</p>
    <p>Just like wills, many peo­ple as­sume that an LPA will come in handy only in old age but the re­al­ity is that no one can tell when trou­ble will strike.</p>
    <p>Take this case. A man had a stroke and went into coma while he was driv­ing home from work. It hap­pened just after he signed an agree­ment to buy a new prop­erty.</p>
    <p>He had to pay the re­main­ing down-pay­ment within a few weeks or risk los­ing tens of thou­sand dol­lars of his ini­tial de­posit.</p>
    <p>He had am­ple funds in his bank ac­count but be­cause he was in coma, he could not con­firm the pur­chase or with­draw money to pay for the prop­erty.</p>
    <p>If he had an LPA, his rep­re­sen­ta­tive could have done both tasks.</p>
    <p>This forced his fam­ily to make an ur­gent court ap­pli­ca­tion to ap­point a rep­re­sen­ta­tive so they would avoid los­ing the de­posit.</p>
    <p>CHAOS WHEN THERE IS NO SUC­CES­SOR</p>
    <p>Fam­ily busi­nesses can be torn apart if the own­ers fail to name a suc­ces­sor, some­thing that hap­pened to a man with four chil­dren.</p>
    <p>After his death, the chil­dren had the right to share his busi­ness equally. Since every­one had equal power, a dis­pute erupted as all of them fought to be­come the leader.</p>
    <p>Ms Sim says these cases high­light the im­por­tance of plan­ning for “the peo­ple most pre­cious to you and hard-earned items in your life”.</p>
    <p>But she warns peo­ple not to try to write wills them­selves.</p>
    <p>“There are many sto­ries of how these can go badly. Please speak with your lawyers or per­sons who are trained and spe­cialise in such work,” she says.</p>
