    <p>NEW YORK • The United Na­tions Se­cu­rity Coun­cil’s re­jec­tion of the United States’ ef­forts to in­def­i­nitely ex­tend an arms em­bargo on Iran un­der­scored Amer­ica’s deep­en­ing global iso­la­tion on the is­sue of Iran.</p>
    <p>But for US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion, the vote could open a sep­a­rate path to try to in­flict max­i­mum dam­age on Iran ahead of the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>For months, US of­fi­cials have warned that if the vote to ex­tend the em­bargo failed, the US would try to in­voke a pro­vi­sion built into the Obama-era nu­clear ac­cord to pun­ish any Ira­nian vi­o­la­tions by reim­pos­ing all sanc­tions lifted when the deal took ef­fect. That could in­clude the pro­hi­bi­tion of not just arms deals, but also oil sales and bank­ing agree­ments.</p>
    <p>In the­ory, all UN mem­bers would have to ad­here to the sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>The pro­vi­sion, known as a snap­back, would be dev­as­tat­ing for Iran, which is al­ready strug­gling with a mori­bund econ­omy made worse by the coro­n­avirus. Pur­su­ing the snap­back would also put the US at odds with its al­lies, which ve­he­mently op­pose it as le­gally du­bi­ous and po­ten­tially desta­bil­is­ing to the re­gion.</p>
    <p>“The US has ev­ery right to ini­ti­ate snap­back,” Ms Kelly Craft, the US Am­bas­sador to the UN, said on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“In the com­ing days, the US will fol­low through on that prom­ise to stop at noth­ing to ex­tend the arms em­bargo.”</p>
    <p>A day after the vote, Mr Trump vowed a tougher re­sponse to Iran.</p>
    <p>Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo de­nounced the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil’s de­ci­sion to scuttle the em­bargo pro­vi­sion, de­scrib­ing it as “in­ex­cus­able”.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tinue to work to en­sure that the theo­cratic ter­ror regime does not have the free­dom to pur­chase and sell weapons that threaten the heart of Europe, the Mid­dle East and be­yond,” he said.</p>
    <p>While Fri­day’s vote was about the du­ra­tion of the arms em­bargo, the heart of the dis­pute be­tween the US and its op­po­nents on the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil is the nu­clear deal. Signed in 2015, the deal freed up the Ira­nian econ­omy by lift­ing sanc­tions in ex­change for Iran agree­ing to halt its nu­clear pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>It was for­mer pres­i­dent Barack Obama’s sig­na­ture diplo­matic achieve­ment, backed by some of Amer­ica’s clos­est al­lies, Bri­tain, France and Ger­many, as well as its strong­est foes, China and Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump came into of­fice vow­ing to dis­man­tle the deal, in­sist­ing he could get a bet­ter one. But when he fi­nally with­drew the US from the ac­cord in 2018, it touched off a diplo­matic con­fla­gra­tion that has at times es­ca­lated to­wards war.</p>
    <p>Since then, Iran has ex­ceeded nu­clear en­rich­ment lim­its set by the ac­cord and launched covert at­tacks on US mil­i­tary tar­gets, while the US has as­sas­si­nated Ira­nian mil­i­tary lead­ers and prox­ies, in­clud­ing the leader of Iran’s rev­o­lu­tion­ary guards Qassem Soleimani.</p>
    <p>The arms em­bargo was de­signed to pre­vent Iran from buy­ing and sell­ing weapons, in­clud­ing air­craft and tanks. It was due to ex­pire in Oc­to­ber, at which point Iran would le­gally be able to be­gin re­plen­ish­ing its arms stock­piles, some­thing the US has said it would not per­mit.</p>
    <p>Of the 15 coun­tries on the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil, only one, the Do­mini­can Repub­lic, joined the US in sup­port­ing the pro­posal.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain, France and Ger­many were among the 11 coun­tries that ab­stained from the vote, mak­ing a promised veto by Rus­sia and China un­nec­es­sary. Rus­sia and China voted against the pro­posal.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics of the US po­si­tion ques­tion whether the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, hav­ing with­drawn from the nu­clear ac­cord, has le­gal stand­ing in any de­bate over its pro­vi­sions – in­clud­ing the arms em­bargo and snap­back.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing failed to live up to its end of the deal, these crit­ics say, the US can­not in­sist on hav­ing a say over whether Iran is re­main­ing faith­ful to it.</p>
    <p>The US State De­part­ment is pre­pared to ar­gue that Amer­ica re­mains a “par­tic­i­pant state” in the nu­clear ac­cord that Mr Trump re­nounced – but only for the pur­poses of in­vok­ing the snap­back.</p>
    <p>In de­fend­ing its pur­suit of the em­bargo, US of­fi­cials have ar­gued that Iran has been vi­o­lat­ing the arms re­stric­tions laid out in the 2015 nu­clear agree­ment.</p>
    <p>West­ern in­tel­li­gence agen­cies along with UN of­fi­cials have deter­mined that mis­siles used in an at­tack on a Saudi Ara­bian oil fa­cil­ity last year were man­u­fac­tured in Iran, as were weapons in­ter­cepted by the US Navy that were bound for Iran’s Houthi al­lies in Ye­men. Iran has dis­missed the al­le­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Judg­ing from US of­fi­cials’ state­ments, the US has lit­tle pa­tience for con­tin­ued de­bate. Rather, Fri­day’s vote could be seen more as a diplo­matic for­mal­ity the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion felt it had to un­der­take as part of a broader ef­fort to achieve its ul­ti­mate goal: Killing the nu­clear deal once and for all.</p>
