    <p>A com­bined ef­fort by the public and pri­vate sec­tors has gen­er­ated around 92,000 new po­si­tions – jobs, trainee­ship and at­tach­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties – it was an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>About seven in 10 of them were pro­fes­sional, man­ager, ex­ec­u­tive and tech­ni­cian (PMET) roles, said Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo, who gave a break­down of the num­bers as at July 31 dur­ing a brief­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>She noted that about half of the 92,000 roles are ei­ther sig­nif­i­cantly funded by the Gov­ern­ment – whether through sub­si­dies to help com­pa­nies take on peo­ple as trainees or on at­tach­ments – or were jobs of­fered by gov­ern­ment agen­cies.</p>
    <p>The other 42,000 place­ments are mostly long-term po­si­tions of­fered by pri­vate firms.</p>
    <p>Long-term po­si­tions re­fer to job or train­ing place­ments that ex­tend be­yond 12 months and are not lim­ited to per­ma­nent po­si­tions. Short-term roles last up to 12 months.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo also noted i n her weekly j obs re­port that about 24,000 peo­ple had been placed into ei­ther em­ploy­ment or train­ing roles as at July 31, with about 60 per cent of those in short­term po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>Around 40 per cent of the 24,000 place­ments are for PMET po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo cited the ex­am­ple of Mr Alvin Lim, a dis­placed worker who found new work op­por­tu­ni­ties af­ter re­trench­ment.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times re­ported last month that Mr Lim, 48, now heads a team of field sur­vey­ors who col­lect data on the labour mar­ket for the Min­istry of Man­power, a role he landed af­ter re­ceiv­ing ad­vice from a ca­reer coach.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said she hopes Mr Lim’s re­silience will en­cour­age other j ob seek­ers not to turn down un­fa­mil­iar or tem­po­rary po­si­tions be­cause these could lead to some­thing more per­ma­nent.</p>
    <p>While the labour mar­ket has soft­ened, there are still pock­ets of hir­ing, she added, not­ing that the Gov­ern­ment will be­gin fea­tur­ing hir­ing sec­tors as well as job op­por­tu­ni­ties as Sin­ga­pore moves to­wards re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo pointed to the key man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor, not­ing that while over­all em­ploy­ment has con­tracted, there are still “pock­ets of hir­ing” in seg­ments such as elec­tron­ics and pre­ci­sion en­gi­neer­ing.</p>
    <p>There are at least 1,000 man­u­fac­tur­ing po­si­tions yet to be filled, she said.</p>
    <p>“We still hope that job seek­ers may con­sider giv­ing these op­por­tu­ni­ties a try be­cause they do al­low you to gain rel­e­vant ex­pe­ri­ence, and hope­fully when the com­pany is in a po­si­tion to hire into per­ma­nent po­si­tions, you will be in a bet­ter place to ac­cess these op­por­tu­ni­ties,” Mrs Teo added.</p>
    <p>Work­force Sin­ga­pore has held more outreach ini­tia­tives to help peo­ple nav­i­gate the jobs and train­ing land­scape.</p>
    <p>Al­most 1,000 op­por­tu­ni­ties in sec­tors such as early child­hood ed­u­ca­tion, lo­gis­tics, man­u­fac­tur­ing, food and bev­er­age, and re­tail were avail­able across 11 walk-in in­ter­views held last month. More than 40 ca­reer work­shops and sem­i­nars were also or­gan­ised last month and were at­tended by around 2,700 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo re­sponded to a ques­tion on whether the Jobs Sup­port Scheme will be ex­tended by not­ing that the Gov­ern­ment is “look­ing ac­tively” at whether broad­based sup­port is still needed, adding that Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat, who is also Fi­nance Min­is­ter, will ad­dress this “quite soon”.</p>
