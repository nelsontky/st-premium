    <p>It is of some con­cern that in the fi­nal week­end be­fore the Christ­mas fes­tiv­i­ties – and ahead of the start of phase three – malls in Sin­ga­pore were teem­ing with pre-pan­demic crowd sizes. Un­der­stand­ably, shop­pers in a festive year-end mood were look­ing for last-minute gifts. That is nat­u­ral be­cause Christ­mas and New Year, like other re­li­gious and sec­u­lar fes­ti­vals, come once a year. What is true in nor­mal times is am­pli­fied by the ab­nor­mal year that is about to pass. Chi­nese New Year man­aged to es­cape, by a whisker, the ar­rival of an un­wel­come pe­riod af­ter Sin­ga­pore con­firmed its first case of Covid-19 on Jan 23. Since then, the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has wreaked havoc on the festive, and reg­u­lar, cal­en­dar as it turned daily life up­side down. It is hu­man na­ture to cel­e­brate the slow re­turn to a new nor­mal. That is what the shop­pers may have been do­ing.</p>
    <p>But it is still days away from phase three of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing on Dec 28, when larger gath­er­ings of up to eight and ex­panded ca­pac­ity lim­its at pub­lic places will be al­lowed. No mat­ter how close it is to that wel­come date, it is es­sen­tial to re­mem­ber that each phase of re­open­ing will work only as well as the safety lev­els achieved in the pre­vi­ous phase. What is heart­en­ing is that, even as the crowds gath­ered, there were pa­trons at malls who dis­played a sense of un­ease over the size of crowds and the lack of safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>That at­ti­tude re­flected their con­cern for both per­sonal safety and civic re­spon­si­bil­ity. Per­sonal re­spon­si­bil­ity must con­tinue to be com­ple­mented by the de­ploy­ment of safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors and of­fi­cial at­tempts to work with re­tail­ers so crowds can be man­aged bet­ter. Yet, no mat­ter how well planned and im­ple­mented such mea­sures are, Sin­ga­pore­ans need to play their part cor­re­spond­ingly by tem­per­ing their be­hav­iour and curb­ing some of their en­thu­si­asm.</p>
    <p>It is not safe to as­sume that Sin­ga­pore is out of the woods. Ev­ery step that is taken be­yond the restrictio­ns that have gov­erned life this year is go­ing to be in­cre­men­tal and will be prone to set­backs. A per­ti­nent ex­am­ple is the dis­cov­ery of a spate of in­fec­tions at the Man­darin Or­chard Sin­ga­pore that has been an un­wel­come sur­prise. Guests have been moved out af­ter the dis­cov­ery of cases af­fect­ing staff and those who were as­signed to the ho­tel un­der stay-home no­tice. Far­ther afield, Bri­tain warned of a new mu­tant strain of the coro­n­avirus that is out of con­trol there, prompt­ing many coun­tries to close their bor­ders to Bri­tish trav­ellers. The good news is that there is no ev­i­dence so far to sug­gest that the strain is more lethal, causes more se­vere ill­ness, or that vac­cines will be any less ef­fec­tive against the vari­ant. In the cir­cum­stances, Sin­ga­pore­ans owe it to them­selves to re­main vig­i­lant against Covid-19. It has not passed. Ex­ten­sive vac­ci­na­tion is still months away. Stay­ing safe is what mat­ters.</p>
