    <p>Peo­ple serv­ing stay-home no­tice (SHN) are iso­lated to pre­vent them from trans­mit­ting the disease to any­one else should they have Covid-19.</p>
    <p>De­spite that, 13 peo­ple on SHN at the Man­darin Or­chard Sin­ga­pore ho­tel may have been in­fected dur­ing their stay there, given the close sim­i­lar­ity of the genome of the virus they had been in­fected by.</p>
    <p>They had come to Sin­ga­pore from 10 dif­fer­ent coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts said that there are var­i­ous ways this could have hap­pened.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong of the Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School, who spe­cialises in emerg­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases and mi­cro­bi­ol­ogy, sug­gested that ho­tel-based trans­mis­sion should be in­ves­ti­gated and stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures should be au­dited for com­pli­ance.</p>
    <p>In its state­ment yes­ter­day, the Min­istry of Health and the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board said: “The Gov­ern­ment takes a se­ri­ous view of any breach in pro­to­cols and will in­ves­ti­gate and take ac­tion should there be non-com­pli­ance.”</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Hsu Li Yang of the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, an in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert by train­ing, said that since the 13 peo­ple had served SHN be­tween Oct 22 and Nov 11, and were con­firmed to be in­fected be­tween Nov 2 and Nov 11, a sin­gle source for the spread of the virus is un­likely.</p>
    <p>He added: “If they did not en­counter one an­other dur­ing their stay, then it could be ho­tel staff or fomites (ob­jects) that formed the trans­mis­sion chain.”</p>
    <p>Whether the spread could have been through tow­els and bed sheets would “de­pend on how th­ese were dis­trib­uted af­ter clean­ing”, he said.</p>
    <p>His col­league, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Alex Cook, vice-dean of re­search at the school, pointed out that given the du­ra­tion, the last of the 13 peo­ple would have checked into the ho­tel af­ter the first had left. Peo­ple are placed on SHN for up to 14 days.</p>
    <p>Prof Cook added that it would be in­ter­est­ing to know if there was any “spa­tial clus­ter­ing” of the 13 peo­ple, such as them stay­ing in rooms on the same floor near one an­other.</p>
    <p>Dr Asok Ku­rup, who chairs the Academy of Medicine’s Chap­ter of In­fec­tious Disease Physi­cians, said aside from trans­mis­sion via a mem­ber of staff or some ob­jects, ven­ti­la­tion and sewage also need to be looked at as pos­si­ble sources of trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>But due to the way the coro­n­avirus spreads, Dr Ku­rup said “a hu­man fac­tor is more likely” to be the cause of any trans­mis­sion in the ho­tel.</p>
