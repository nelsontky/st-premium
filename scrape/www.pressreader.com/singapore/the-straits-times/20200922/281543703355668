    <p>China’s Ti­betan ex­perts sense a pos­si­ble shift in of­fi­cial at­ti­tude to­wards the Dalai Lama. Whether that will hap­pen or not, what is clear is that time is run­ning short and the stakes for sta­bil­ity in the restive re­gion are high, says global af­fairs cor­re­spon­dent Ben­jamin Kang Lim (be­low).</p>
    <p>Lis­ten­ing is an art, per­haps more so in the opaque world of Chi­nese pol­i­tics. What is not said is some­times as im­por­tant as, if not more so than, what is said. That is be­cause the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party (CCP) rarely ad­mits a pol­icy mis­take or an­nounces that it is chang­ing course to avoid a loss of face.</p>
    <p>Catch­ing the sound of si­lence is a tricky, ar­cane busi­ness. But when it hap­pens, the ex­perts perk up and try to de­ci­pher what will fol­low. So it was with the community of Ti­bet watch­ers in China late last month when the party’s elite 200-odd-mem­ber Cen­tral Com­mit­tee con­vened its seventh Ti­bet Work Fo­rum in Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Some Ti­betol­o­gists sen­si­tive to nu­ances no­ticed a sub­tle change in tone in Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s speech at the high-pow­ered meet­ing, which was at­tended by all seven mem­bers of the party’s Polit­buro Stand­ing Com­mit­tee, the apex of power in China.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi de­clared that China must build an “im­preg­nable fortress” to main­tain sta­bil­ity in the restive Hi­malayan re­gion and ed­u­cate the masses in the strug­gle against “split­tism”, party jar­gon for in­de­pen­dence. He also called for the sini­ci­sa­tion of Ti­betan Bud­dhism.</p>
    <p>The tough talk is not unusual in of­fi­cial mes­sag­ing on Ti­bet. But Sichuan Univer­sity eth­nic mi­nori­ties ex­pert Zhu Jingjin noted in an on­line es­say that Mr Xi made no men­tion this time of “un­wa­ver­ingly ad­her­ing to the prin­ci­ples and poli­cies of the strug­gle against the Dalai clique”, which was one of the high­lights of his speech at the sixth Ti­bet Work Fo­rum five years ago.</p>
    <p>OLIVE BRANCH?</p>
    <p>An­other Ti­betol­o­gist, who re­quested anonymity, was also struck by the omis­sion. “It is tan­ta­mount to ex­tend­ing an olive branch to the Dalai Lama,” the ex­pert told The Straits Times. “It’s a sign di­a­logue may re­sume.”</p>
    <p>China reg­u­larly uses the deroga­tory term “the Dalai clique” to re­fer to Ti­bet’s spir­i­tual leader and his gov­ern­ment-in-ex­ile. The Dalai Lama fled with about 100,000 fol­low­ers to India in 1959 af­ter an abortive up­ris­ing against Chi­nese com­mu­nist rule. Since then, talks be­tween the two sides have been patchy.</p>
    <p>The party’s United Front Work De­part­ment, which has re­spon­si­bil­ity for mat­ters re­lated to eth­nic mi­nori­ties, and the Cab­i­net’s State Ad­min­is­tra­tion for Re­li­gious Af­fairs, which over­sees re­li­gions in China, were mum when asked if and when talks would be re­sumed.</p>
    <p>China’s Ti­bet poli­cies have come un­der the spot­light again this year amid the coun­try’s de­te­ri­o­rat­ing re­la­tion­ship with the United States. In July, US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo said Washington would re­strict visas for some Chi­nese of­fi­cials in­volved in en­gag­ing in “hu­man rights abuses” there.</p>
    <p>From China’s per­spec­tive, when it took con­trol of Ti­bet in 1950, it was an act of lib­er­a­tion that helped Ti­bet throw off its “feu­dal­ist” past.</p>
    <p>But crit­ics say Chi­nese rule in the decades since was tan­ta­mount to “cul­tural geno­cide”, with Man­darin re­plac­ing Ti­betan as a medium of in­struc­tion in schools; Ti­betans are also barred from hoist­ing prayer flags and their chil­dren from study­ing at Ti­betan monas­ter­ies. What’s worse, they say, the 11th Panchen Lama – the sec­ond-most im­por­tant fig­ure in Ti­betan Bud­dhism – has been kid­napped and re­placed by a Chi­nese-in­stalled pup­pet. Since 2009, more than 150 Ti­betans have self-im­mo­lated in protest against Chi­nese rule.</p>
    <p>In re­cent years, as China’s eco­nomic clout has grown, the Dalai Lama’s room for ma­noeu­vre on the in­ter­na­tional stage has shrunk as foreign lead­ers, in­clud­ing In­dian Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi, skirted the is­sue of Ti­bet to avoid an­ger­ing Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>So, apart from the Ti­betan ex­perts’ close read­ing of of­fi­cial party texts, what are the other pos­si­ble rea­sons for be­liev­ing that a shift in China’s at­ti­tude on Ti­bet is un­der way?</p>
    <p>HOS­TILE EX­TER­NAL EN­VI­RON­MENT</p>
    <p>Geopol­i­tics is a ma­jor fac­tor. China is hav­ing prob­lems not just with the US but also with other coun­tries, in­clud­ing India, Aus­tralia and Ja­pan. Euro­pean coun­tries are in­creas­ingly wary of Bei­jing while the coun­try’s South China Sea claims re­main a source of fric­tion with its South-east Asian neigh­bours. Across a range of is­sues – Covid-19, bor­der dis­putes, ac­cu­sa­tions of un­fair and preda­tory trade prac­tices, its ac­tions in Xin­jiang and Hong Kong – Bei­jing is get­ting ham­mered daily.</p>
    <p>Mend­ing fences with the Dalai Lama in these trou­bled times would be use­ful in hav­ing one fewer hot spot to deal with.</p>
    <p>Good­will is a two-way street, and it has not gone un­no­ticed that the Dalai Lama has kept a cir­cum­spect si­lence amid the vol­leys of ac­cu­sa­tions against China over its han­dling of the pan­demic. He has also re­frained from harsh crit­i­cism of Mr Xi, whose fa­ther, the late Xi Zhongxun, was a lib­eral com­mu­nist who cham­pi­oned the rights of eth­nic mi­nori­ties. The Dalai Lama gave the se­nior Mr Xi a watch in 1954 as a to­ken of friend­ship.</p>
    <p>Bet­ter re­la­tions with the Dalai Lama would also make it harder for the US and India to use the Ti­bet card at a time when China’s west­ern flank is in a bad state, with un­wanted at­ten­tion fo­cused on Xin­jiang and a Hi­malayan bor­der dis­pute with India turn­ing deadly in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>As Sino-India re­la­tions nose dive, for­mer In­dian na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser M. K. Narayanan wrote re­cently in The Hindu news­pa­per that New Delhi needs to rec­tify its mis­take in dis­tanc­ing it­self from the Dalai Lama. Both he and Mr Jayadeva Ranade, a for­mer China spe­cial­ist at India’s foreign in­tel­li­gence agency, the Re­search and Anal­y­sis Wing, see the Ti­betan leader as an im­por­tant fac­tor in India’s anti-China pol­icy.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese lead­ers are also aware that the win­dow of op­por­tu­nity for some kind of rap­proche­ment is lim­ited. The Dalai Lama, 85, is rel­a­tively healthy. But he is not im­mor­tal. Bei­jing reg­u­larly ac­cuses him of seek­ing sep­a­ratism, but he in­sists he merely seeks gen­uine au­ton­omy for his home­land; his views and author­ity make him the best avail­able channel to bring about a peace­ful set­tle­ment.</p>
    <p>THE KEY</p>
    <p>“The Dalai Lama is the key to (sta­bil­ity in) Ti­bet,” says Mr Wang Lix­iong, the Bei­jing-based au­thor of Sky Burial – The Fate Of Ti­bet. Mr Wang met the Dalai Lama four times in the US in 2001 and penned a book on their talks.</p>
    <p>It is no se­cret the Dalai Lama hopes to re­turn home one day de­spite more than six decades in ex­ile. He re­it­er­ated his wish to make a pil­grim­age to the sa­cred Mount Wu­tai in China’s north­ern prov­ince of Shanxi as re­cently as 2018.</p>
    <p>Most Ti­betans are pi­ous Bud­dhists and proud that their god-king won the No­bel Peace Prize in 1989 and in­ter­na­tion­alised Ti­betan Bud­dhism. Many would be fu­ri­ous if he died in ex­ile. Some may turn to vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>If trou­ble breaks out, China has to worry about main­tain­ing sta­bil­ity not only in Ti­bet proper but also in the prov­inces of Gansu, Qing­hai, Sichuan and Yun­nan, all of which have large num­bers of Ti­betans.</p>
    <p>When the present Dalai Lama dies, the spir­i­tual search for his rein­car­na­tion as the 15th Dalai Lama will be one fraught with geopo­lit­i­cal com­pli­ca­tions. Who the right­ful suc­ces­sor is will be fought by many par­ties – Bei­jing, Ti­bet’s gov­ern­ment-in-ex­ile in</p>
    <p>Dharam­sala, Washington and New Delhi.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, the US Congress unan­i­mously and pre-emp­tively passed a Bill threat­en­ing sanc­tions against Chi­nese of­fi­cials who in­ter­vene in the Dalai Lama’s suc­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>Not un­ex­pect­edly, Bei­jing fears his­tory re­peat­ing it­self. It would be a nightmare for China if Ti­betans take up arms again. There are an es­ti­mated 2,000 ex­iled Ti­betans serv­ing in the In­dian army. Rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion of the Ti­bet Youth Congress is cer­tainly con­ceiv­able.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese fears are not un­founded. The US Cen­tral In­tel­li­gence Agency (CIA) col­lab­o­rated with the Dalai Lama’s brother, Mr Gyalo Thondup, in the 1950s and 1960s, smug­gling hun­dreds of young Ti­betans to Colorado for clan­des­tine train­ing at Camp Hale, a mil­i­tary fa­cil­ity with the same al­ti­tude as Ti­bet, ac­cord­ing to CIA vet­eran and case of­fi­cer for Ti­bet John Ken­neth Knaus in his book, Or­phans Of The Cold War.</p>
    <p>Plans for them to fight a guerilla war against the Chi­nese Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army were shelved af­ter then US Pres­i­dent Richard Nixon’s land­mark trip to China in 1972.</p>
    <p>Short of a guerilla war, the Chi­nese also fear re­newed un­rest in the re­gion. Ri­ots broke in Ti­bet’s cap­i­tal Lhasa in March 1989, two months af­ter the death of the 10th Panchen Lama, and again in March 2008, five months be­fore Bei­jing hosted the Sum­mer Olympics. Scores died and hun­dreds were wounded in the two in­ci­dents. Pre­dictably, Chi­nese hawks sus­pect Washington was be­hind the ri­ots.</p>
    <p>HAWKS AND DY­ING DOVES</p>
    <p>Rap­proche­ment be­tween the Dalai Lama and Bei­jing faces great odds, not least the forces op­posed to it. Some of the Dalai Lama’s fam­ily mem­bers and the gov­ern­ment-in-ex­ile as well as hawks in the US and India are against deals with the Chi­nese. Deep dis­trust of Bei­jing and fear of los­ing pre­cious lever­age are mo­ti­vat­ing fac­tors.</p>
    <p>While there is no dearth of hawks in the CCP on the Ti­bet is­sue, doves have be­come a rare species, par­tic­u­larly since the death in 2014 of Mr Phuntso Wangye, a one-time se­nior mem­ber of China’s Par­lia­ment who wrote to then Pres­i­dent Hu Jin­tao, call­ing for rec­on­cil­i­a­tion be­tween Bei­jing and the Dalai Lama and for his re­turn to Ti­bet.</p>
    <p>Ti­bet may seem a re­mote cor­ner of the world, but there is no deny­ing its strate­gic im­por­tance. It spans some 2.4 mil­lion sq km, nearly a quar­ter of China’s ter­ri­tory, with an es­ti­mated pop­u­la­tion of six mil­lion. Ti­bet marks China’s west­ern edge and is a vi­tal link be­tween China and South and Cen­tral Asia.</p>
    <p>Ti­bet’s glaciers and snow-swept high­lands feed Asia’s rivers – the Brahma­pu­tra, In­dus, Mekong, Yangtze, Yel­low and Sal­ween. China’s biggest cop­per de­posit is at Ti­bet’s Yulong cop­per mine. Ti­bet also has large iron, lead, zinc and cad­mium de­posits, min­er­als vi­tal to China’s econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing and the Dalai Lama’s en­voys have in­ter­mit­tently held talks since 1979, when then para­mount leader Deng Xiaop­ing ush­ered in eco­nomic re­forms and an open-door pol­icy.</p>
    <p>Deng told Mr Thondup that “any­thing can be dis­cussed ex­cept in­de­pen­dence” dur­ing one of about 20 trips he made to China from 1980 to 1993.</p>
    <p>“(But) we came to the con­clu­sion that Bei­jing was not sin­cere and did not want to achieve a set­tle­ment” on the ques­tion of Ti­bet, Mr Thondup’s son, Khe­droob, said in an in­ter­view via e-mail. The younger</p>
    <p>Mr Thondup, a for­mer mem­ber of Ti­bet’s Par­lia­ment-in-ex­ile, had ac­com­pa­nied his fa­ther to China on more than 10 trips.</p>
    <p>Af­ter talks broke down be­tween Bei­jing and the Thondups, the Dalai Lama’s en­voys and Bei­jing held more talks be­hind closed doors in the en­su­ing years, but they were in­con­clu­sive. The last known pub­lic meet­ing be­tween the Dalai Lama’s spe­cial en­voys and their Chi­nese coun­ter­parts was in mid-2005 in Bern, Switzer­land. Since then, a cur­tain of si­lence has fallen on whether any fur­ther ef­forts have been made.</p>
    <p>No mat­ter what one makes of the Ti­betol­o­gists’ as­sess­ment of Mr Xi’s speech last month, this much is clear – the dead­lock on the Ti­betan is­sue will not re­main frozen in­def­i­nitely, and time is run­ning short.</p>
