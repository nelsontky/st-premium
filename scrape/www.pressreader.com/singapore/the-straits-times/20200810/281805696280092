    <p>NEW YORK • Twit­ter has ap­proached TikTok’s Chi­nese owner ByteDance to ex­press in­ter­est in ac­quir­ing the US oper­a­tions of the video-shar­ing app, two peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter told Reuters, as ex­perts raised doubts over the so­cial me­dia plat­form’s abil­ity to put to­gether fi­nanc­ing for a po­ten­tial deal.</p>
    <p>It is far from cer­tain that Twit­ter could out­bid Mi­crosoft and com­plete such a trans­for­ma­tive deal in the 45 days that US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has given ByteDance to agree to a sale, the sources said last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The news of Twit­ter and TikTok be­ing in pre­lim­i­nary talks and Mi­crosoft still be­ing seen as the front run­ner in bid­ding for the app’s US oper­a­tions was re­ported ear­lier by The Wall Street Jour­nal.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter has a mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion of close to US$30 bil­lion (S$41 bil­lion), al­most as much as the val­u­a­tion of TikTok’s as­sets to be di­vested, and would need to raise ad­di­tional cap­i­tal to fund the deal, ac­cord­ing to the sources.</p>
    <p>“Twit­ter will have a hard time putting to­gether enough fi­nanc­ing to ac­quire even the US oper­a­tions of TikTok. It doesn’t have enough bor­row­ing ca­pac­ity,” said Pro­fes­sor Erik Gor­don at the Univer­sity of Michi­gan.</p>
    <p>He added: “If it (Twit­ter) tries to put to­gether an in­vestor group, the terms will be tough. Twit­ter’s own share­hold­ers might pre­fer that man­age­ment fo­cus on its ex­ist­ing busi­ness.”</p>
    <p>One of Twit­ter’s share­hold­ers, pri­vate eq­uity firm Sil­ver Lake, is in­ter­ested in help­ing fund a po­ten­tial deal, one of the sources added.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter has also pri­vately made a case that its bid would face less reg­u­la­tory scru­tiny than Mi­crosoft’s, and will not face any pressure from China, given that it is not active in that coun­try, the sources said.</p>
    <p>Mi­crosoft said it was aim­ing to con­clude ne­go­ti­a­tions for a deal by the mid­dle of next month.</p>
