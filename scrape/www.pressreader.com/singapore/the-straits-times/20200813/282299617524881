    <p>In­vestors had few leads from Wall Street to latch on to yes­ter­day while a level of wari­ness lingers around Rus­sia’s an­nounce­ment of a Covid-19 vac­cine.</p>
    <p>As sub­dued as the mar­ket was, the Straits Times In­dex (STI) man­aged to inch up 19.05 points, or 0.75 per cent, to 2,563.20 al­though losers slightly out­stripped gain­ers 220 to 215. There were 1.63 bil­lion shares worth $1.63 bil­lion traded.</p>
    <p>The STI’s mod­est gain was some­thing of a sur­prise given the wel­ter of bad news around to sour moods.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s Cathay Pa­cific was the lat­est airline to re­port how the pan­demic has bat­tered its busi­ness, with news that it lost HK$9.9 bil­lion (S$1.8 bil­lion) in the first half.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Bri­tain’s econ­omy con­tracted by a record 20.4 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter while New Zealand re-en­tered par­tial lock­down with the most se­vere mea­sures in Auck­land, the coun­try’s eco­nomic en­gine.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal in­vestors still found some rays of light.</p>
    <p>Agri-busi­ness group Wil­mar In­ter­na­tional was among the bet­ter per­form­ing STI con­stituents with a 2.1 per cent in­crease to $4.79 af­ter de­liv­er­ing a bumper half-year re­sult.</p>
    <p>RHB Se­cu­ri­ties Sin­ga­pore an­a­lyst Ju­liana Cai main­tained her “buy” rec­om­men­da­tion with a tar­get price of $5.45, not­ing that the re­sults were bet­ter than ex­pected.</p>
    <p>Top Glove topped the de­clin­ers chart, down 9.3 per cent to $8.19.</p>
    <p>The glove maker’s stock price went into re­verse gear on Tues­day and the de­scent con­tin­ued yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The sell­ing pres­sure came af­ter Top Glove said on Mon­day that it ex­pects to pay about RM53 mil­lion (S$17.3 mil­lion) in re­me­di­a­tion fees to mi­grant work­ers it em­ployed be­fore it im­ple­mented a new stan­dard for eth­i­cal re­cruit­ment last year.</p>
    <p>News of the Rus­sian vac­cine also hit glove mak­ers.</p>
    <p>The most ac­tive was Medtecs In­ter­na­tional, up 44.6 per cent to $1.41 on trade of 150.5 mil­lion af­ter post­ing a half-year net profit that was more than 100-fold higher than last year.</p>
    <p>Asian mar­kets largely per­formed bet­ter, de­spite Wall Street end­ing in the red overnight.</p>
    <p>South Korean shares rose for the eighth straight ses­sion to their high­est close since June 12, 2018. The Hang Seng In­dex added 1.42 per cent to an al­most three-week high and the Nikkei added 0.41 per cent.</p>
    <p>On the deficit side, Shang­hai dipped 0.63 per cent and Aus­tralia fell 0.11 per cent.</p>
