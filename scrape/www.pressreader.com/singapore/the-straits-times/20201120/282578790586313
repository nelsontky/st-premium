    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tain’s Prince Wil­liam has wel­comed a new in­ves­ti­ga­tion into how the BBC se­cured a fa­mous 1995 in­ter­view with his mother Princess Diana af­ter ac­cu­sa­tions that she had been tricked into tak­ing part.</p>
    <p>The new in­quiry led by a for­mer Supreme Court jus­tice will fo­cus on how the broad­caster ob­tained the in­ter­view and whether ex­ec­u­tives covered up any wrong­do­ing.</p>
    <p>“The in­de­pen­dent in­ves­ti­ga­tion is a step in the right di­rec­tion,” Prince Wil­liam said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“It should help es­tab­lish the truth be­hind the ac­tions that led to the Panorama in­ter­view and sub­se­quent de­ci­sions taken by those in the BBC at the time.”</p>
    <p>During Princess Diana’s in­ter­view with jour­nal­ist Martin Bashir, watched by more than 20 mil­lion view­ers in Bri­tain, she shocked the na­tion by ad­mit­ting to an af­fair and giv­ing in­ti­mate de­tails of her failed mar­riage to heir-to-thethrone Prince Charles.</p>
    <p>She fa­mously said “there were three peo­ple” in her mar­riage – her, Charles and his l ong-time lover Camilla Parker-Bowles.</p>
    <p>This month, her brother Charles Spencer said the BBC had failed to apol­o­gise for what he said were forged doc­u­ments and “other de­ceit” which led him to in­tro­duce Princess Diana to Mr Bashir.</p>
    <p>The BBC’s di­rec­tor-general Tim Davie said the broad­caster was de­ter­mined to get to the truth about Earl Spencer’s claims.</p>
    <p>The Earl says Mr Bashir made a se­ries of al­le­ga­tions to him and his sis­ter, such as Princess Diana was be­ing bugged by the se­cu­rity ser­vices and that two se­nior aides were be­ing paid to pro­vide in­for­ma­tion about her. He says Mr Bashir pro­vided fake bank state­ments to back up the claim.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers in­volved in mak­ing the pro­gramme have also come for­ward to say the BBC had covered up wrong­do­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Bashir has made no pub­lic com­ment to the media and the BBC says the jour­nal­ist, who gained global renown from the Princess Diana in­ter­view and is the cor­po­ra­tion’s re­li­gious af­fairs cor­re­spon­dent, is on sick leave, re­cov­er­ing from heart surgery and Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The BBC said its in­ves­ti­ga­tion would ex­am­ine five ques­tions such as what steps the BBC and Mr Bashir took to ob­tain the in­ter­view, “in­clud­ing the mocked-up bank state­ments pur­port­ing to show pay­ments to a for­mer em­ployee of Earl Spencer, the pur­ported pay­ments to mem­bers of the royal house­holds and the other mat­ters re­cently raised by Earl Spencer.”</p>
