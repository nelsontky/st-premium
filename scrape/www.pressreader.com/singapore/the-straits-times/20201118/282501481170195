    <p>Train­ing to be­come an elite en­durance ath­lete means learn­ing to em­brace dis­com­fort.</p>
    <p>In­stead of hid­ing from pain, ath­letes must learn to work with it. A lot of that comes down to pac­ing, says sports psy­chol­o­gist Carla Mei­jen.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, as you mus­cle through an on­go­ing pan­demic, you must look for ways to make peace with un­knowns and new, un­com­fort­able re­al­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“When we think about the coro­n­avirus, we are in it for the long run, so how do you pace your­self?” says Dr Mei­jen, a se­nior lec­turer at St Mary’s Univer­sity in Lon­don.</p>
    <p>She rec­om­mends think­ing about your rou­tines, prac­tis­ing pos­i­tive self-talk and fo­cus­ing on pro­cesses in­stead of out­comes. You do not know when the pan­demic will end, but you can take con­trol of your daily habits, she adds.</p>
    <p>Con­rad Anker knows some­thing about that. The cel­e­brated 57-year-old Amer­i­can moun­taineer has, among other things, as­cended the Meru Peak Shark’s Fin route in In­dia and thrice to Mount Ever­est’s sum­mit – once with­out sup­ple­men­tal oxy­gen – and sur­vived a heart at­tack while climb­ing in the Hi­malayas.</p>
    <p>He ad­vises peo­ple to “al­ways have a lit­tle in re­serve”. De­plete your re­sources early and you will be in trou­ble. Fo­cus­ing on day-to-day activities will pay off in the long run. If you use all your men­tal en­ergy in one day or week, you may find it more dif­fi­cult to adapt when things do not re­turn to nor­mal as quickly as you hope.</p>
    <p>“When you get to the sum­mit and you use ev­ery sin­gle iota of en­ergy and calories to get there, and you don’t have the strength to get down, then you’re set­ting your­self up for an ac­ci­dent or for some­thing to go wrong,” says Anker. “Don’t play all your cards at once and keep a lit­tle some­thing in re­serve.”</p>
