    <p>Two years ago, I re­viewed the Creative Sxfi Amp, a USB-C don­gle that recre­ated sur­round sound with a re­al­is­tic sense of depth, space and de­tail through any regular set of head­phones.</p>
    <p>It fea­tured Creative’s Su­per X-Fi head­phone holog­ra­phy tech­nol­ogy, which not only sim­u­lated sur­round sound, but also op­ti­mised au­dio based on each user’s ears and head shape.</p>
    <p>While the USB drive-size don­gle – which can be used with any head­phones that have a 3.5mm plug – was handy, there is now an even more con­ve­nient form avail­able. Creative has created the Sxfi Trio wired in-ear head­phones.</p>
    <p>This pair of head­phones has a smaller ver­sion of the Sxfi Amp as an in-line con­trol along its Kevlar USB-C ca­ble.</p>
    <p>Called Sxfi Wire, the in-line con­trol is 40 per cent smaller than the Amp and has a but­ton to turn the Sxfi tech­nol­ogy on and off, along with three other but­tons for mu­sic play­back con­trols.</p>
    <p>The ear­buds have a black semi­con­i­cal body and a round gold­plated mag­netic cap. They come with Creative’s Au­raSeal Noise Iso­la­tion ear tips, touted to pro­vide ex­cel­lent pas­sive noise can­cel­la­tion.</p>
    <p>I find this noise seal to be pretty good. Six pairs of ear tips of dif­fer­ent sizes are in­cluded, in or­der to en­sure there is one pair that will suit you best and give the ideal seal.</p>
    <p>I also like that the ear­buds can be con­nected mag­net­i­cally to­gether and that the ca­ble does not tan­gle eas­ily.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the in­cluded sil­i­cone case to store the Trio is a dust mag­net – not to men­tion this ma­te­rial usu­ally dis­in­te­grates quickly in our hu­mid cli­mate.</p>
    <p>Inside each ear­bud is a tripledriv­er sys­tem, which com­prises a su­per tweeter, a mid-range driver and a bio-cel­lu­lose dy­namic driver, said to re­pro­duce the en­tire au­dio fre­quency range.</p>
    <p>For those new to Sxfi, you have to down­load the Sxfi An­droid app and use it to “map” your head. Ba­si­cally, you need to take pho­tos of your ears and face to get your own cus­tomised sound pro­file from the map­ping.</p>
    <p>As I have re­viewed the Sxfi Amp be­fore, I sim­ply logged into my ac­count on the Sxfi app and linked the Trio to my An­droid smart­phone. The app de­tected the Trio and au­to­mat­i­cally loaded my Sxfi pro­file, while also up­dat­ing the Trio’s firmware to the lat­est ver­sion.</p>
    <p>Once the user pro­file has been loaded into the Trio, you can use the head­phones with de­vices such as the Nin­tendo Switch and other USB-C de­vices to get the sur­round-sound ef­fect.</p>
    <p>The Trio comes with a USB-C-toUSB-A adapter, so you can con­nect the Trio to most lap­tops. While the USB-C Trio can­not con­nect to iPhones, it works with USB-C MacBook Pro lap­tops.</p>
    <p>Us­ing the Trio to watch Net­flix and Ap­ple TV+ movies on my MacBook Pro was a joy. You get al­most cin­e­matic sur­round sound when watch­ing movies.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, when watch­ing Avengers: Endgame (2019), I could sense where the ex­plo­sions and di­a­logue were com­ing from.</p>
    <p>Lis­ten­ing to mu­sic with Sxfi might not be the best ex­pe­ri­ence, as the sound might seem to have an echo. But for those who love the con­cert feel, this ef­fect could be great.</p>
    <p>I pre­fer to lis­ten to mu­sic with Sxfi dis­abled, as I feel the mu­sic details come across richer that way. By it­self, this set of head­phones de­liv­ers de­tailed highs, smooth mids, clean vo­cals and rich bass.</p>
    <p>Con­sid­er­ing the Sxfi Amp al­ready costs $219, the Sxfi Trio is su­perb value for money at $199, as you get both the Sxfi Amp and a qual­ity pair of in-ear head­phones.</p>
