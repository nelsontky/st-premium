    <p>The im­mi­nent restart of foot­ball’s Sin­ga­pore Premier League (SPL) is inch­ing closer. How­ever, a restart of Sin­ga­pore’s only pro­fes­sional sports league, which has been sus­pended since March 24, will hinge on an an­nounce­ment by the Covid-19 multi-min­istry task force.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing af­ter the Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (FAS) an­nual congress yes­ter­day, the gov­ern­ing body’s pres­i­dent Lim Kia Tong noted “some healthy signs” re­gard­ing the coro­n­avirus sit­u­a­tion here and added: “With the fur­ther open­ing of the coun­try and other mea­sures in­volved... we hope to see (the) re­sump­tion in the first part of Oc­to­ber.”</p>
    <p>Lo­cal SPL teams were al­lowed to re­sume full train­ing on Sept 1 and the FAS had ini­tially hoped to restart the league be­fore the end of this month. The Sun­day Times un­der­stands the FAS could meet club of­fi­cials be­fore the end of next week, and, should the multi-min­istry task force give the go-ahead, the first SPL game could take place on the week­end of Oct 10.</p>
    <p>Games will be played with­out fans and pre­cau­tions in place will be sim­i­lar to when the SPL moved to closed-door matches shortly be­fore its sus­pen­sion. It is un­clear if there are test­ing pro­to­cols re­quired for play­ers and teams.</p>
    <p>FAS gen­eral sec­re­tary Yazeen Buhari said there would be changes in the for­mat of the com­pe­ti­tion – orig­i­nally, each club in the nineteam league were to play each other thrice – but did not elab­o­rate.</p>
    <p>Ques­tion marks, how­ever, re­main over the participat­ion of cham­pi­ons Brunei DPMM.</p>
    <p>On Sept 1, Brunei and Sin­ga­pore agreed to es­tab­lish a re­cip­ro­cal green lane to fa­cil­i­tate es­sen­tial busi­ness and of­fi­cial travel for “a lim­ited num­ber of” res­i­dents from both coun­tries.</p>
    <p>How­ever, on Sept 19, the Na­tional</p>
    <p>Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Brunei an­nounced it would can­cel its do­mes­tic Brunei Super League, as well as its youth tour­na­ments in­volv­ing the Un­der-19 and U-16 teams.</p>
    <p>Lim said the FAS has been do­ing “ev­ery­thing pos­si­ble” to fa­cil­i­tate DPMM’s con­tin­u­a­tion in the SPL when it re­sumes, in­clud­ing work­ing closely with the Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs.</p>
    <p>DPMM have yet to re­sume full train­ing – they have been al­lowed to train only in groups of 10 since last month – and coach Adrian Pen­nock ac­knowl­edged the pos­si­bil­ity of his side not par­tic­i­pat­ing.</p>
    <p>“We want to de­fend our ti­tle, ob­vi­ously, and if the league re­sumes with­out us, it would be a shame,” the Bri­ton said in a phone call from Ban­dar Seri Be­gawan.</p>
    <p>“It’s a very dif­fi­cult de­ci­sion, but we have to take note of the wel­fare of our staff and our team, and also the Sin­ga­pore teams that have to come here to play. I hope (we don’t have to sit out) but I to­tally un­der­stand if the Brunei health min­is­ter says we can­not play. It’s out of our hands now, re­ally.”</p>
    <p>In his ad­dress at the FAS congress, Lim also gave an up­date on the Goal 2034 project, which aims to send the Li­ons to the World Cup. He said the as­so­ci­a­tion will form a steer­ing com­mit­tee com­pris­ing rel­e­vant stake­hold­ers from the gov­ern­ment, the cor­po­rate sec­tor as well as the foot­ball fra­ter­nity.</p>
    <p>The FAS also an­nounced it is work­ing with Fifa on a sub­ven­tion pro­gramme which will see am­a­teur clubs in Sin­ga­pore re­ceiv­ing about $500,000 over two years, start­ing from next year.</p>
    <p>The clubs in­clude those in the Sin­ga­pore Foot­ball League (SFL), Women’s Premier League, Women’s Na­tional League and Is­land Wide League.</p>
    <p>Amos Boon, head coach of SFL Divi­sion 2 side Sin­ga­pore Cricket Club, said: “There is now greater fi­nan­cial in­cen­tive for ev­ery am­a­teur side to per­form well on the pitch, while at the same time at­tain a higher level of pro­fes­sion­al­ism in terms of the day-to-day op­er­a­tions.”</p>
    <p>With the fur­ther open­ing of the coun­try and other mea­sures in­volved... we hope to see (the) re­sump­tion in the first part of Oc­to­ber.</p>
