    <p>Tributes have poured in for late Hong Kong ac­tress Lee He­ung Kam, in­clud­ing from younger ac­tors who re­mem­ber how the vet­eran took care of them when they worked to­gether.</p>
    <p>Lee died at 88 on Mon­day, with some me­dia re­ports say­ing that she had been turned away by two pri­vate hos­pi­tals as they were un­able to ac­cept emer­gency cases.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong ac­tress Louise Lee, who acted with Lee He­ung Kam in the tele­vi­sion se­ries Moon­light Res­o­nance (2008), posted two pho­tos (one shown here, far left) of them to­gether.</p>
    <p>Louise Lee, 70, wrote: “Sis­ter Kam is an en­er­getic, hard­work­ing and car­ing se­nior. I re­mem­ber once, while act­ing in Moon­light</p>
    <p>Res­o­nance, she saw me hav­ing a headache and asked if I had high blood pres­sure. I replied: ‘ No, I never had this prob­lem.’</p>
    <p>“Sis­ter Kam brought a blood pres­sure monitor the next day and mea­sured my blood pres­sure. We dis­cov­ered I have high blood pres­sure and she asked me to lie down and rest.</p>
    <p>“These are un­for­get­table lit­tle in­ci­dents. Sis­ter Kam, I will miss you and re­mem­ber you for­ever.”</p>
    <p>Ac­tress Margie Tsang acted with Lee He­ung Kam in TV se­ries such as The New Heaven Sword And The Dragon Sabre (1986) and The Sil­ver Ty­coon (1993), in which they played mother and daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>Tsang, 55, posted on Weibo two pho­tos of them to­gether (one shown here, left). She wrote: “I was very sad when I heard the news, but I must ac­cept it and face it strongly. When we played mother and daugh­ter to­gether, she re­ally cared for us, the ju­niors, and did not put on airs.”</p>
    <p>Vet­eran ac­tors who worked with Lee re­mem­ber her fondly as well.</p>
    <p>Liza Wang, 73, worked with Lee sev­eral times on Hong Kong broad­caster TVB’s long-run­ning va­ri­ety show En­joy Your­self Tonight (1967 to 1994).</p>
    <p>Wang, who is a former Can­tonese opera star like Lee, posted a photo of Lee with the words “Sis­ter Kam, rest in peace” and wrote: “Her ju­niors such as I will miss her dearly. Sis­ter Kam is tal­ented and known for her achieve­ments in mu­sic, films, tele­vi­sion and Can­tonese opera.”</p>
    <p>Other celebri­ties who paid trib­ute to Lee on so­cial me­dia in­cluded ac­tors Louis Koo and Ray­mond Lam as well as direc­tors Lee Lik Chi and Gor­dan Chan.</p>
