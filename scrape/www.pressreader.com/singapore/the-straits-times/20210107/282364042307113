    <p>LON­DON • The WTA Tour will fol­low its usual sched­ule for most of 2021 de­spite the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, af­ter or­gan­is­ers on Tues­day an­nounced an up­dated cal­en­dar which takes the sea­son through to Wim­ble­don in July.</p>
    <p>The In­dian Wells event, jointly held with the ATP Tour, was post­poned from its usual March date, while the Aus­tralian Open Grand Slam has been de­layed un­til Feb 8.</p>
    <p>But top-level tournament­s, in­clud­ing the Mi­ami Open, Madrid Open and Ital­ian Open, will all go ahead as usual.</p>
    <p>“The cur­rent sched­ule re­flects a tra­di­tional WTA Tour cal­en­dar for the ma­jor­ity of the sea­son past mid-March,” the WTA said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The women’s tour also added that “al­ter­na­tives are be­ing as­sessed” for a new date to hold In­dian Wells. Fur­ther up­dates for the 2021 sea­son past Wim­ble­don will be con­firmed in “due course”.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the Abu Dhabi sea­son-opener, which started yes­ter­day and runs till next Wed­nes­day, there will be two events in Mel­bourne in the run-up to the Aus­tralian Open.</p>
    <p>The men’s cir­cuit starts to­day with the Del­ray Beach Open in Florida, where Chilean world No. 22 Cris­tian Garin is the top seed. The event is run­ning con­cur­rently with an­other hard-court tour­na­ment in An­talya, Turkey.</p>
    <p>The ATP last month an­nounced its re­vised cal­en­dar for the year, with tournament­s in Rot­ter­dam, Buenos Aires, Doha, San­ti­ago, Mar­seille, Aca­pulco and Dubai set to take place in March.</p>
    <p>Be­yond the March 24-April 4 Mi­ami Open, the men’s sched­ule re­mains ten­ta­tive al­though former ATP chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer and chair­man Chris Ker­mode has told the Ten­nis Pod­cast that the Monte Carlo Mas­ters, which was axed last year due to the pan­demic, will “def­i­nitely be held in 2021”.</p>
    <p>Wim­ble­don, the only Grand Slam scrapped last year, has also said it is con­sid­er­ing hold­ing the grass-court event be­hind closed doors, but an­other can­cel­la­tion is not on the agenda.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­is­ers plan to is­sue a fur­ther up­date at the end of this month.</p>
