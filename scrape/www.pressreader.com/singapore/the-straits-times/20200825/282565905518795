    <p>CARNDONAGH (IRE­LAND) • Mr Steven McGoni­gal crosses a pock­marked field in the north of Ire­land with a box of un­ruly ferrets while his dog, Fudge, sniffs out rab­bit war­rens.</p>
    <p>As the lurcher does his work, Mr McGoni­gal cov­ers the open­ings with nets be­fore re­leas­ing a sin­gle fer­ret down the hole to flush out the oc­cu­pants in­side.</p>
    <p>For five min­utes, the fer­ret races around the un­der­ground tun­nels, pok­ing its head out of dot­ted holes like a whack-a-mole.</p>
    <p>Mr McGoni­gal looks on in twitchy an­tic­i­pa­tion.</p>
    <p>Then, in a split-sec­ond blur of grey fur, a rab­bit emerges tan­gled in a net. Mr McGoni­gal sprints over, grasps it by the legs and neck and dis­patches it with a deft tug.</p>
    <p>“It’s the tra­di­tional way,” the 37-year-old for­mer ac­coun­tant said in a field out­side Carndonagh at the north­ern edge of Ire­land.</p>
    <p>“We don’t dam­age the ground, we’re not lay­ing poi­sons, we give the rab­bits a quick and clean death – and that’s most im­por­tant.”</p>
    <p>Mr McGoni­gal is said to be Ire­land’s last tra­di­tional rab­bit catcher, preferring ferrets, dogs, spades and nets over mod­ern guns and poi­son.</p>
    <p>Rab­bits – fluffy, cute and doeeyed to many and kept as house­hold pets – are con­sid­ered pests in the coun­try­side.</p>
    <p>They are greedy con­sumers of veg­e­ta­tion, their war­rens com­pro­mise build­ings and their breed­ing rate can quickly in­flate num­bers.</p>
    <p>As well as gar­den­ers and farm­ers, Mr McGoni­gal has built up a client list for his ser­vices in­clud­ing schools, golf cour­ses and oil re­finer­ies.</p>
    <p>Be­com­ing the last rab­bit catcher in Ire­land’s emer­ald out­doors is a far cry from his for­mer ac­count­ing job.</p>
    <p>“I was get­ting to where I was look­ing for­ward to go­ing out, I was start­ing to dread go­ing back in,” he said of his pre­vi­ous num­ber-crunch­ing pro­fes­sion.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a child­hood spent own­ing ferrets, fish­ing and shoot­ing, tak­ing the ca­reer leap to full-time rab­bit catcher in 2013 was a nat­u­ral step, he said.</p>
    <p>But he ad­mit­ted that the some­times grisly de­mands of killing rab­bits by hand is not for ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>“It doesn’t ap­peal to a lot of peo­ple,” he con­ceded.</p>
    <p>The prac­tice of rab­bit catch­ing with ferrets dates back cen­turies.</p>
    <p>An il­lus­tra­tion in the 14th-cen­tury man­u­script, the Tay­mouth Hours, de­picts a woman send­ing a dog or a fer­ret down a war­ren to drive a rab­bit out into a net.</p>
    <p>Mr McGoni­gal be­lieves that while the an­cient hands-on method may be dis­taste­ful to some, it re­mains the best way to cull num­bers.</p>
    <p>“The prob­lem is nowa­days... peo­ple are build­ing houses far­ther and far­ther and far­ther, and they’re en­croach­ing into the coun­try­side every day,” he said.</p>
    <p>As hu­man and an­i­mal king­doms be­come in­creas­ingly in­ter­twined, less re­fined meth­ods of hunt­ing have be­come pop­u­lar – and dam­ag­ing.</p>
    <p>Lead shot from guns can taint the soil and poi­sons can be in­dis­crim­i­nate, leav­ing an­i­mal corpses un­der­ground with no in­di­ca­tion of how many have been killed.</p>
    <p>Mr McGoni­gal’s tech­nique leaves no trace and al­lows him to pre­cisely mea­sure the num­ber of rab­bits he has re­moved from the land­scape, which he be­lieves keeps the ecosys­tem and food chain bet­ter cal­i­brated.</p>
    <p>“No­body loves rab­bits more than me,” he said.</p>
    <p>“But we have to keep the balance – the coun­try­side is al­ways about the balance.”</p>
