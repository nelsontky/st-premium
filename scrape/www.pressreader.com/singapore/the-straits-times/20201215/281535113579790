    <p>The Health Sciences Au­thor­ity (HSA) yesterday ap­proved the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine in Singapore, and said it will keep mon­i­tor­ing it to en­sure that it con­tin­ues to be safe for use.</p>
    <p>“We will draw on our net­work of healthcare pro­fes­sion­als and in­ter­na­tional reg­u­la­tory coun­ter­parts, as well as use data an­a­lyt­ics, to en­able us to de­tect early safety sig­nals,” said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Chan Cheng Leng, group direc­tor of HSA’s health prod­ucts reg­u­la­tion group.</p>
    <p>“This will en­able HSA to take swift reg­u­la­tory ac­tions should any safety con­cern emerge.”</p>
    <p>For in­stance, as a con­di­tion for the in­terim au­tho­ri­sa­tion, HSA said Pfizer and BioNTech are re­quired to mon­i­tor the longer-term ef­fi­cacy of the vaccine to de­ter­mine the du­ra­tion of pro­tec­tion against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>This will sup­ple­ment the avail­able data which shows that the vaccine is ef­fec­tive for at least two months, with no signs of wan­ing pro­tec­tion, HSA said.</p>
    <p>The firms must also fol­low up on the safety of the vaccine for a longer pe­riod to de­ter­mine its full safety pro­file, and study the safety of the vaccine in sub-pop­u­la­tions such as in preg­nant women and chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“The com­pa­nies must con­tinue sub­mit­ting the longer-term fol­lowup data to HSA to as­sure the con­tin­ued ef­fec­tive­ness and safety of the vaccine,” the au­thor­ity said in a state­ment yesterday.</p>
    <p>“HSA will ac­tively re­view the data to en­sure that the ben­e­fits of the vaccine con­tinue to out­weigh the known risks,” it said, adding that it may ter­mi­nate its use if, for ex­am­ple, the ben­e­fits no longer out­weigh the risks.</p>
    <p>The first ship­ment of the vaccine is ex­pected to ar­rive here by the end of this month, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said yesterday.</p>
    <p>This makes Singapore one of the first coun­tries to ob­tain this vaccine, he added. Other vac­cines are ex­pected to ar­rive here in the com­ing months. “If all goes ac­cord­ing to plan, we will have enough vac­cines for ev­ery­one in Singapore by the third quar­ter of 2021,” PM Lee said.</p>
    <p>Britain was the first coun­try to ap­prove the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on Dec 2. Since then, Canada, the United States and Mex­ico are among those that have also ap­proved the use of this vaccine.</p>
    <p>The ap­provals come af­ter US phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal gi­ant Pfizer and its Ger­man part­ner BioNTech re­leased last month the fi­nal re­sults from the late-stage trial of the Covid-19 vaccine.</p>
    <p>The find­ings showed that their vaccine was 95 per cent ef­fec­tive in pre­vent­ing a per­son from get­ting ill from the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>This vaccine ef­fi­cacy was ob­served to be con­sis­tent across dif­fer­ent age groups 16 years and older in over 40,000 clin­i­cal trial par­tic­i­pants, whose ages ranged from 16 to 91 years, said the HSA.</p>
    <p>But the au­thor­ity said cer­tain groups of peo­ple, such as those with a his­tory of ana­phy­laxis, or the rapid onset of se­vere al­ler­gic re­ac­tions, should not re­ceive the vaccine as a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure.</p>
    <p>Preg­nant women, im­muno­com­pro­mised per­sons and those un­der the age of 16 should also not re­ceive the vaccine as the safety and ef­fi­cacy data on th­ese groups of peo­ple is not avail­able yet.</p>
