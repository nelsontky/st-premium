    <p>BEI­JING • The Chi­nese city of Qing­dao yes­ter­day said it had sus­pended its health com­mis­sion head and sacked a hospi­tal direc­tor fol­low­ing an out­break of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions that ended China’s run of about two months with­out re­port­ing a lo­cal case.</p>
    <p>The head of the hospi­tal, Dr Deng Kai, was fired yes­ter­day. The lo­cal health bureau said he had been “re­moved from of­fice” and was “un­der fur­ther in­ves­ti­ga­tion”, but did not give de­tails.</p>
    <p>The head of the city’s health bureau, Mr Sui Zhen­hua, was also “sus­pended from the post” and placed un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion. Bei­jing’s Na­tional Health Com­mis­sion has not of­fered any de­tails on why Mr Sui was sus­pended.</p>
    <p>The port city in east­ern Shan­dong prov­ince has re­ported 13 re­cent i nfec­tions, most of them linked to the Qing­dao Chest Hospi­tal where in­fected trav­ellers ar­riv­ing from over­seas had been treated in an iso­la­tion area.</p>
    <p>One of the cases in­volved a dock worker who had ear­lier tested pos­i­tive for the virus but de­vel­oped symp­toms only after about 20 days, the city said.</p>
    <p>Al­most 10 mil­lion res­i­dents in Qing­dao have now been screened for the coro­n­avirus, of­fi­cials said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Deputy Mayor Luan Xin said more than 9.9 mil­lion sam­ples had been col­lected and 7.6 mil­lion re­sults re­turned, adding that no new cases had been found.</p>
    <p>The coastal city has now con­firmed 13 cases, Mr Luan told a reg­u­lar brief­ing yes­ter­day, adding that health work­ers were on track to com­plete test­ing 9.4 mil­lion res­i­dents and another 1.5 mil­lion vis­i­tors by to­day – just five days after the mass test­ing pro­gramme was launched.</p>
    <p>The to­tal num­ber of con­firmed coro­n­avirus cases in main­land China stands at 85,622, with 4,634 deaths.</p>
