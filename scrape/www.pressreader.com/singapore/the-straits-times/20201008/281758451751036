    <p>While busi­nesses shut and work­ers stayed at home in April as the cir­cuit breaker in Sin­ga­pore started, Ms Intan Adam, 47, bucked the trend and found a new job in a dif­fer­ent sec­tor.</p>
    <p>She had worked as a hu­man re­source and ad­min­is­tra­tion man­ager at a man­u­fac­tur­ing firm for 20 years, be­fore tak­ing nearly a year off in Jan­uary 2018 to travel around In­dia, the Mid­dle East and Europe.</p>
    <p>When she tried to re­turn to the work­force in Oc­to­ber 2018, she had difficulty find­ing a job, and af­ter more than six months, she sought help from Work­force Sin­ga­pore (WSG) in Au­gust last year.</p>
    <p>She was re­ferred to one of WSG’s ca­reer match­ing providers, Ingeus, and a ca­reer coach guided her in her job hunt, in­clud­ing how to im­prove her re­sume and on­line pro­file.</p>
    <p>In April, in­te­rior de­sign firm WEDA Stu­dioInc was look­ing for a hu­man re­source and ad­min­is­tra­tion man­ager when it came across Ms Intan’s pro­file on MyCa­reer­sFu­ture through the por­tal’s Sug­gested Tal­ent fea­ture.</p>
    <p>The firm was at­tracted by her years of ex­pe­ri­ence and lead­er­ship abil­i­ties, in­ter­per­sonal re­la­tion­ship build­ing and crit­i­cal think­ing, and con­tacted her, al­though she did not have the in­dus­try knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>While she did not ap­ply for the job, Ms Intan seized the op­por­tu­nity, even though it was in an un­fa­mil­iar sec­tor. She said: “I was so sur­prised. At first, my boss texted me and I didn’t re­spond as I thought it was a scam.</p>
    <p>“He texted again and I had an in­ter­view the fol­low­ing week, then started work the next day.”</p>
    <p>On the chal­lenges of adapt­ing to a new en­vi­ron­ment, Ms Intan said: “Pre­vi­ously, I was in a big­ger com­pany so I could eas­ily ac­cess ev­ery­thing and had a big­ger bud­get. But this com­pany is smaller and in a dif­fer­ent sec­tor.”</p>
    <p>She added that some re­sources</p>
    <p>SUR­PRISE OP­POR­TU­NITY</p>
    <p>I was so sur­prised. At first, my boss texted me and I didn’t re­spond as I thought it was a scam... He texted again and I had an in­ter­view the fol­low­ing week, then started work the next day.’’</p>
    <p>MS INTAN ADAM, on be­ing con­tacted by in­te­rior de­sign firm WEDA Stu­dioInc for a po­si­tion even though her pre­vi­ous work ex­pe­ri­ence had been with a man­u­fac­tur­ing firm.</p>
    <p>such as cer­tain com­puter soft­ware were not read­ily avail­able and she con­vinced her bosses to get them, as she knew they would help the firm’s work pro­cesses based on her pre­vi­ous ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Min­istry of Man­power, the match­ing of Ms Intan with WEDA Stu­dioInc hap­pened as both par­ties were open-minded in their searches.</p>
    <p>Since join­ing the firm, Ms Intan has been in­volved in set­ting up its new di­vi­sion, Grey­line So­lu­tions, which han­dles con­tainer ac­com­mo­da­tion. Grey­line So­lu­tions has since taken in three peo­ple un­der the SGUnited Trainee­ships Pro­gramme.</p>
