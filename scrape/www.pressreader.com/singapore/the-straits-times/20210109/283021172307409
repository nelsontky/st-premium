    <p>Mr Andy Ng says his mod­i­fied Hyundai i30 has a re­spectable per­for­mance</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial planner Andy Ng be­lieves in stretch­ing the dol­lar – a phi­los­o­phy he ap­plies to his car pur­chases.</p>
    <p>The 30-year-old bought his first car, a Kia Cer­ato Forte, three years ago. He co-owned the nine-year-old man­ual sedan with his then girl­friend and they paid $12,000 for it.</p>
    <p>Af­ter do­ing the sums, they found that a car with one year left on its cer­tifi­cate of en­ti­tle­ment (COE) was an af­ford­able way to own a set of wheels.</p>
    <p>The car was scrapped in 2018 and made way for an 81/ 2- year-old Kia Cer­ato Koup which cost $19,000.</p>
    <p>Be­cause the two cars shared sim­i­lar parts, Mr Ng had rel­a­tively new items he bought dur­ing re­pairs for the Forte trans­planted to the Koup.</p>
    <p>Both Kias were prac­ti­cal bud­get cars, but Mr Ng has also been nurs­ing a pas­sion for per­for­mance cars, ig­nited by a steady diet of Ini­tial D anime films in his teens.</p>
    <p>Last Au­gust, af­ter the Koup’s COE ex­pired, the bach­e­lor bought a Hyundai i30 hatch, which he reck­ons is a fun ride with­out him hav­ing to break the bank for it.</p>
    <p>He had con­sid­ered other cars, in­clud­ing the BMW 118i and Volk­swa­gen Golf, but de­cided on the i30 be­cause it “of­fered good value for money... and its 128bhp and 242Nm of torque were re­spectable fig­ures”.</p>
    <p>He adds: “Korean cars have come a long way in terms of dura­bil­ity and are now packed with fea­tures that can give their Con­ti­nen­tal ri­vals a run for their money.”</p>
    <p>The i30 was then re­tail­ing at around $90,000, but Mr Ng got “a great of­fer” be­cause the Hyundai agent was clear­ing stock of the 1.4-litre to make way for a new 1-litre vari­ant.</p>
    <p>He de­clines to say how much he paid, but hinted that the amount was slightly above the price of a twoyear-old sec­ond-hand unit, which cost around $70,000 at the time.</p>
    <p>The only thing he did not like about the car was its cham­pagne hue, which he felt was an “un­cle colour”. All he could think about was what colour to re­spray it.</p>
    <p>He wanted a unique hue with­out com­ing across as too flam­boy­ant and set­tled on a bat­tle­ship grey, which he felt had “an un­der­stated mas­culin­ity”.</p>
    <p>Be­sides send­ing the car for re­spray­ing, he bought a new set of 18-inch wheels and tyres.</p>
    <p>Other mod­i­fi­ca­tions in­clude a Bas­tuck ex­haust sys­tem, which gives the i30 a “low throaty note”. To im­prove han­dling, he in­stalled a set of BC BR Coilovers, along with a strut bar, anti-roll bar and cross bar.</p>
    <p>The petrol­head has spent about $10,000 on the mod­i­fi­ca­tions and is pleased with how the i30 looks and drives.</p>
    <p>He thinks it is money well spent as he can en­joy the im­prove­ments for at least five, if not 10, years be­fore he buys a new car.</p>
    <p>And that could very well be his dream car – the Nis­san GT-R, one of the cars fea­tured in Ini­tial D.</p>
