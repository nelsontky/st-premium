    <p>Hong Kong’s leg­is­la­ture sat empty of pro-democ­racy law­mak­ers yes­ter­day af­ter the bloc re­signed en masse in protest at the city’s pro-Bei­jing gov­ern­ment ban­ning four of their col­leagues from hold­ing of­fice.</p>
    <p>China la­belled the res­ig­na­tions a “bla­tant chal­lenge” to its au­thor­ity. The United States and Bri­tain warned of sanc­tions against of­fi­cials in China and Hong Kong, while the Euro­pean Union urged Bei­jing to re­verse course.</p>
    <p>Claire Huang</p>
    <p>Hong Kong Cor­re­spon­dent</p>
    <p>The fu­ture of the pan-democrats’ fight to keep the free­doms</p>
    <p>Hong Kong en­joyed un­der an in­creas­ingly as­sertive Bei­jing looks bleak, with some po­lit­i­cal watch­ers say­ing the op­po­si­tion camp may have made a costly mis­take with the move to re­sign en masse.</p>
    <p>The 15 op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers, in­clud­ing Demo­cratic Party’s Wu Chi Wai and Ted Hui, as well as pan-dem bloc mem­ber Clau­dia Mo, handed in their res­ig­na­tion yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ms Mo, an in­de­pen­dent leg­is­la­tor, told The Straits Times their ex­its from the leg­is­la­ture were not uni­form as they had dif­fer­ent sched­ules and con­sid­er­a­tions. Mr Hui’s exit was im­me­di­ate while Ms Mo will leave to­day, and the rest on Dec 1.</p>
    <p>Their exit fol­lows a swift move on Wed­nes­day by China’s top leg­isla­tive body, the Na­tional Peo­ple’s Con­gress Stand­ing Com­mit­tee (NPCSC), which passed a res­o­lu­tion that gave</p>
    <p>Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam’s ad­min­is­tra­tion the power to un­seat four op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>This comes as the Hong Kong’s Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil (Legco) is at an im­passe, un­able to prop­erly carry out its du­ties or pass Bills, in­clud­ing a con­tro­ver­sial mas­sive land recla­ma­tion project, due in part to the bit­ter di­vide be­tween the pro-gov­ern­ment and op­po­si­tion camps.</p>
    <p>Par­lia­men­tary ses­sions in the past year or so were marked with dis­rup­tive the­atrics from the pan-dems who saw it as a fea­si­ble way to stall di­vi­sive poli­cies from be­ing passed.</p>
    <p>Min­utes af­ter Bei­jing’s de­ci­sion on Wed­nes­day, the Hong Kong gov­ern­ment an­nounced the dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tion of four op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers – Civic Party’s</p>
    <p>Mr Alvin Ye­ung, Mr Kwok Ka Ki and Mr Dennis Kwok, as well as Mr Ken­neth Le­ung of the Pro­fes­sion­als Guild.</p>
    <p>This prompted the pan-dem camp to an­nounce hours later the res­ig­na­tion of the re­main­ing 15 op­po­si­tion leg­is­la­tors</p>
    <p>The Par­lia­ment is left with only two non-es­tab­lish­ment law­mak­ers and 41 who are pro-Bei­jing, in ef­fect cre­at­ing what some said was a rub­ber-stamp gov­ern­ment – some­thing dis­missed by Hong Kong of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion of the op­po­si­tion came as a “big sur­prise” to As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Sing Ming of the Hong Kong Uni­ver­sity of Sci­ence and Tech­nol­ogy. He thinks the mass res­ig­na­tion is “very costly” as any leg­is­la­ture, par­tic­u­larly in a regime, can grill the gov­ern­ment and get in-depth in­for­ma­tion on con­tro­ver­sial poli­cies.</p>
    <p>“That kind of whis­tle-blow­ing can dele­git­imise an au­thor­i­tar­ian gov­ern­ment in due course, which is vi­tal for the long-term suc­cess of any democ­racy or lib­er­al­i­sa­tion move­ment.</p>
    <p>“Sec­ond, they can get close to HK$30 mil­lion (S$5.2 mil­lon) a year and then they can em­ploy a lot of staff, do­ing all kinds of po­lit­i­cal ed­u­ca­tion, po­lit­i­cal mo­bil­i­sa­tion and work that help to strengthen the civil so­ci­ety, which is an­other im­por­tant bat­tle­field for any long-term suc­cess of a democ­racy move­ment,” said Prof Sing.</p>
    <p>Ms Mo said these were the two rea­sons the op­po­si­tion camp stayed on in of­fice when the</p>
    <p>Legco elec­tion, slated for Septem­ber, was de­layed for a year.</p>
    <p>The NPCSC had in Au­gust ex­tended the leg­isla­tive term by a year, a move widely seen as Bei­jing go­ing back on prom­ises to up­hold the city’s Ba­sic Law and the “One Coun­try, Two Sys­tems” prin­ci­ple.</p>
    <p>But this time round, the op­po­si­tion had to quit, Ms Mo said. “We have to protest (against) Bei­jing’s crack­down on Hong Kongers’ dis­sent be­cause if you look at the con­tent of this Bei­jing res­o­lu­tion, it’s so en­com­pass­ing, so in­clu­sive...any­thing that you say or do that is not liked by Bei­jing, you can be chucked out.”</p>
    <p>Also the 15 pan-dems would not meet the min­i­mum num­ber re­quired to block di­vi­sive poli­cies, Ms Mo noted. “They (Bei­jing) could vote us out any time, so what’s the point of stay­ing on?”</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Al­fred Wu of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Pol­icy be­lieves the op­po­si­tion has no bet­ter so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>“Bei­jing wants a Chi­nese model in Hong Kong; it means that the Par­lia­ment will co­op­er­ate with the gov­ern­ment to pass the Bills. Even if they stayed in Legco, they would not be able to play their roles as the op­po­si­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Cor­nell Uni­ver­sity’s pro­fes­sor of gov­ern­ment Allen Carl­son thinks China could be tak­ing ad­van­tage of the sit­u­a­tion in the United States.</p>
    <p>“There is a dan­ger that (Chi­nese Pres­i­dent) Xi Jin­ping will see this pe­riod as one of es­pe­cially pro­nounced Amer­i­can weak­ness and look to take ad­van­tage of it to force­fully move to chal­lenge the sta­tus quo in China’s pe­riph­eral re­gions,” Prof Carl­son warned.</p>
    <p>The mixed mes­sages sent out dur­ing the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, in­clud­ing sanc­tions and call­ing Hong Kong pro­test­ers “ri­ot­ers”, might have em­bold­ened Pres­i­dent Xi to act more as­sertively to­wards Hong Kong, he noted.</p>
    <p>And even though it may be too soon to tell, Ms Mo ad­mit­ted that the fu­ture of Hong Kong’s fight for democ­racy looks bleak.</p>
    <p>“We can’t even stage a fight in the streets be­cause of the coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions. Now that we’ve quit the leg­is­la­ture, there’s no leg­isla­tive fight ei­ther. So what’s next?</p>
    <p>“We can’t say this is the end of Hong Kong’s democ­racy fight be­cause you do not un­der­es­ti­mate Hong Kong peo­ple and their de­ter­mi­na­tion to fight for their fu­ture, es­pe­cially the young. We just need to carry on in civil so­ci­ety,” she said.</p>
    <p>The Par­lia­ment is left with only two non-es­tab­lish­ment law­mak­ers and 41 who are pro-Bei­jing.</p>
