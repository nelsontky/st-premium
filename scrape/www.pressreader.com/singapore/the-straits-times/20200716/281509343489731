    <p>Bring­ing to­gether pa­trons and artists through the power of mu­sic, vir­tual fund-rais­ing con­cert ChildAid 2020 – Vir­tu­ally Yours de­lighted on­line view­ers with a starstud­ded show yes­ter­day evening.</p>
    <p>The 16th edi­tion of the con­cert was an en­gag­ing mu­si­cal and dance med­ley fea­tur­ing homegrown mu­si­cians such as ChildAid alum­nus Nathan Hartono, j azz mae­stro Jeremy Mon­teiro, or­ches­tra con­duc­tor Wong Kah Chun, as well as artists Jas­mine Sokko and Ben­jamin Kheng.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­ised by The Straits Times and The Busi­ness Times, the show is aimed at rais­ing funds for The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund (STSPMF), which helps about 10,000 dis­ad­van­taged stu­dents pay for their meals and trans­port, and The Busi­ness Times Bud­ding Artists Fund (BTBAF), which sup­ports lessons in the per­form­ing and vis­ual arts for 1,000 fi­nan­cially dis­ad­van­taged chil­dren who are ar­tis­ti­cally tal­ented.</p>
    <p>“Over­whelm­ing” was how Ms Elfa Ir­wani Amin Iskak de­scribed the vir­tual con­cert which she watched with her fam­ily.</p>
    <p>The 45-year-old, an ad­min­is­tra­tor at In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion (ITE) Col­lege Cen­tral, who has been an avid sup­porter of ChildAid since its in­cep­tion, was heart­ened by the ef­fort that went into the show.</p>
    <p>“The small sup­port we give goes a long way in help­ing fam­i­lies and chil­dren. I work very closely with stu­dents who have ben­e­fited from the STSPMF, and have watched how it has sup­ported stu­dents at the ITE,” she added.</p>
    <p>Ms Elfa said the seg­ment fea­tur­ing ChildAid alumni and sup­port­ers singing A World To Imag­ine was heart-warm­ing, and she was glad to share the ex­pe­ri­ence with her three daugh­ters aged 11,15 and 17.</p>
    <p>Another viewer, Ms Leong Cheng Yee, 44, said the vir­tual con­cert was a good way for home-grown artists to ex­tend their reach be­yond Sin­ga­pore’s shores.</p>
    <p>“There have been many dig­i­tal per­for­mances that have come up since the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod. But what stood out for me in this con­cert was the sleek pre­sen­ta­tion and re­lat­able per­for­mances,” she said.</p>

    <p>THINGS IN COM­MON</p>
    <p>OCBC, be­ing the long­est-es­tab­lished bank in Sin­ga­pore, and ST have many sim­i­lar­i­ties – we both have seen Sin­ga­pore through the highs and the lows; we both have ex­panded our cov­er­age be­yond Sin­ga­pore to the re­gion; and we both have ex­ten­sively lever­aged tech­nol­ogy and data to con­tin­u­ally im­prove cus­tomers’ ex­pe­ri­ences ’’ with us.</p>
    <p>MR SA­MUEL TSIEN, group CEO of OCBC Bank.</p>
    <p>RE­LI­ABLE RE­SOURCE</p>
    <p>The Straits Times has come a long way since it was launched on July 15, 1845... Its rich his­tory, to­gether with its timely cov­er­age of lo­cal and in­ter­na­tional news and in-depth analy­ses, has ce­mented its po­si­tion as a re­li­able and cred­i­ble re­source for ’’</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>MR LIM MING YAN, chair­man of the Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion and for­mer pres­i­dent and group chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Cap­i­taLand. He is also a Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>HU­MAN IN­TER­EST STO­RIES</p>
    <p>I hope that ST will con­tinue to share more hu­man sto­ries that will demon­strate to read­ers in Sin­ga­pore that ath­letes with dis­abil­i­ties are more than just ath­letes who can achieve sig­nif­i­cant break­throughs – we’re ’’ peo­ple first.</p>
    <p>NUR SYAHIDAH ALIM, TeamSG para archer.</p>
    <p>tions di­rec­tor, added that she was grate­ful to be able to watch the show with friends over din­ner, which would not have been pos­si­ble at a phys­i­cal con­cert.</p>
    <p>The con­cert, which is sup­ported by main spon­sors UOB and UBS, as well as plat­inum spon­sors Citi and Richard Mille, has raised $1.95 mil­lion as of last night.</p>
    <p>Tra­di­tion­ally held at the end of the year, the show was brought for­ward to this month to help those im­pacted by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob, who de­liv­ered the open­ing re­marks for the con­cert, said she was heart­ened that ChildAid has been rais­ing funds for less for­tu­nate chil­dren and their fam­i­lies through the STSPMF and BTBAF.</p>
    <p>Said Madam Hal­imah: “The ini­tia­tives have im­proved their lives while en­abling them to pur­sue their in­ter­ests in the arts and mu­sic sec­tor.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing this chal­leng­ing pe­riod, it is even more im­por­tant that we pro­vide con­tin­ued sup­port for the vul­ner­a­ble groups in so­ci­ety. I hope the con­cert will en­cour­age every­one to do­nate gen­er­ously, to help the less for­tu­nate amongst us.”</p>
    <p>The first vir­tual edi­tion of ChildAid also marks two key mile­stones – the 175th an­niver­sary of The Straits Times and the 20th an­niver­sary of the STSPMF.</p>
    <p>Mr War­ren Fer­nan­dez, ed­i­tor of The Straits Times and ed­i­tor-inchief of Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings’ English/Malay/Tamil Me­dia Group, noted that while the de­ci­sion to hold a vir­tual con­cert was brought on by the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, it also re­flected the tremen­dous ef­forts made over the years to trans­form ST from a print prod­uct into a mul­ti­me­dia news form able to de­liver news and in­ter­est­ing con­tent any­where and any time.</p>
    <p>Thank­ing view­ers for their sup­port for the STSPMF and BTBAF, Mr Fer­nan­dez said: “It is with your sup­port that we’re able to help the many fam­i­lies and chil­dren who come to us for sup­port at this very dif­fi­cult time.”</p>
