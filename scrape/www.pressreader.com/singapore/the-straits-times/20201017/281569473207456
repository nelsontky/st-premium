    <p>It is time for changes to the data pro­tec­tion regime in Sin­ga­pore. Law don Si­mon Ch­ester­man says there are three ques­tions worth keep­ing in mind as Par­lia­ment pre­pares to de­bate the new law.</p>
    <p>Data, in par­tic­u­lar per­sonal data, is of­ten de­scribed as the “new oil” pow­er­ing the in­for­ma­tion econ­omy. It’s an at­trac­tive metaphor – evok­ing trans­for­ma­tions un­der way in a fourth in­dus­trial rev­o­lu­tion, herald­ing a world of ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and lim­it­less pos­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, that metaphor is wrong in al­most ev­ery way.</p>
    <p>Oil is fi­nite, com­pa­nies pay mil­lions to extract it, and each bar­rel can be used only once. Data, by con­trast, is in­fi­nite, con­sumers give it to you for free, and you can keep us­ing it for as long as you like.</p>
    <p>Eight years ago, Sin­ga­pore adopted the Per­sonal Data Pro­tec­tion Act (PDPA) – not long af­ter the re­lease of the iPhone 5, back when Snapchat was a hot new app.</p>
    <p>Sub­se­quent years have seen a mas­sive ex­pan­sion in the data-driven econ­omy, with the full ben­e­fits yet to be re­alised.</p>
    <p>The dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion has been over­whelm­ingly pos­i­tive. We con­nect with oth­ers and ac­cess re­sources more eas­ily than at any time in hu­man his­tory. This was a boon dur­ing the pan­demic. As dif­fi­cult as lock­downs have been in Sin­ga­pore and around the world, imag­ine work­ing from home if you had only a 2G phone and a dial-up In­ter­net con­nec­tion.</p>
    <p>The darker side, of course, is that “sur­veil­lance cap­i­tal­ism” is funded by ex­ploit­ing our data. Data is not the prod­uct be­ing bought and sold: we are.</p>
    <p>Breaches such as that ex­pe­ri­enced by SingHealth in 2018 are use­ful re­minders that another down­side of con­ve­nience is risk. That same year, Cambridge An­a­lyt­ica showed that per­sonal data could be used to steal elec­tions as well as iden­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>And so ear­lier this month, the Gov­ern­ment in­tro­duced the first ma­jor amend­ments to the PDPA. As Par­lia­ment pre­pares to de­bate the new law, here are three ques­tions worth keep­ing in mind – plus a bit of ex­tra home­work.</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>I SHARE, THERE­FORE I AM</p>
    <p>First, what is data, any­way?</p>
    <p>We rou­tinely talk about “our” per­sonal data and get up­set when some­one “steals” it. Is our data a piece of prop­erty, like a bi­cy­cle?</p>
    <p>When Face­book chief ex­ec­u­tive Mark Zucker­berg tes­ti­fied be­fore the United States Congress in 2018, he re­peat­edly said “peo­ple own all of their own con­tent”. Maybe our per­sonal data is closer to copy­right?</p>
    <p>The prob­lem with think­ing of per­sonal data in ei­ther of th­ese ways is that they fail to recog­nise its true value and the on­go­ing in­ter­ests of the in­di­vid­ual iden­ti­fied by it – even if he or she chooses to “sell” it.</p>
    <p>You can­not, in any mean­ing­ful sense, “sell” your per­sonal data. More­over, so­ci­ety has an in­ter­est in treat­ing per­sonal data as more than a com­mod­ity that can be bought and sold.</p>
    <p>Your name, for ex­am­ple, is not used merely as a per­sonal iden­ti­fier or as a so­cial marker for the con­ve­nience of friends and fam­ily. It also has le­gal sig­nif­i­cance: We are as­signed it at birth, use it to pay taxes and vote, en­ter it into a regis­ter when open­ing a bank ac­count, and so on. In Sin­ga­pore the Na­tional Reg­is­tra­tion Iden­tity Card plays a sim­i­lar role.</p>
    <p>This ques­tion is of more than aca­demic in­ter­est, be­cause it high­lights a fun­da­men­tal flaw in the per­sonal data pro­tec­tion regime to date.</p>
    <p>The PDPA, like most such laws around the world, re­lies heav­ily on con­sent.</p>
    <p>In the­ory, when your per­sonal data is col­lected, used or dis­closed, it is on the ba­sis of an agree­ment between you and the or­gan­i­sa­tion do­ing so. Typ­i­cally, this takes the form of a con­tract with hun­dreds or even thou­sands of words.</p>
    <p>In re­al­ity, of course, you don’t read the terms and just click on “I ac­cept”. (I’m a law pro­fes­sor who has pub­lished books on data pro­tec­tion, and even I don’t read them.)</p>
    <p>As com­put­ing be­comes ubiq­ui­tous, the idea that we trans­fer prop­erty or some other kind of right dozens of times a day with each “agree­ment” won’t just be an aca­demic prob­lem but a prac­ti­cal one as well.</p>
    <p>Rather than re­ly­ing on ar­ti­fi­cial no­tions of con­sent, the amend­ments recog­nise that or­gan­i­sa­tions may have a le­git­i­mate in­ter­est in col­lect­ing per­sonal data.</p>
    <p>In­stead of putting the onus on the con­sumer to read the fine print in all cases, the obli­ga­tion will fall on the or­gan­i­sa­tion to pro­vide proper no­ti­fi­ca­tion and guard against any “ad­verse ef­fects”.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>ONCE MORE UNTO THE BREACH</p>
    <p>This leads to the sec­ond ques­tion. When or­gan­i­sa­tions are col­lect­ing ever more per­sonal data, how can we best pro­tect it?</p>
    <p>One way is by let­ting the pun­ish­ment fit the crime.</p>
    <p>In 2012, the $1 mil­lion fine in the PDPA sounded like a lot of money. Then in 2018, the Euro­pean Union’s Gen­eral Data Pro­tec­tion</p>
    <p>Reg­u­la­tion (GDPR) in­tro­duced a fine of €20 mil­lion (S$32 mil­lion) or 4 per cent of an­nual global turnover – which­ever is greater. For Face­book, that could mean a fine of $4 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Not to be out­done, the PDPA amend­ments ini­tially pro­posed fines of up to 10 per cent of an­nual turnover.</p>
    <p>As Sean Con­nery’s char­ac­ter quipped in The Un­touch­ables: Don’t bring a knife to a gun­fight.</p>
    <p>Based on feed­back dur­ing the pub­lic con­sul­ta­tion pe­riod, how­ever, this is now based on turnover in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Fines usu­ally come too late to help con­sumers, any­way. More im­por­tant are new re­quire­ments to un­der­take risk as­sess­ments and manda­tory data breach no­ti­fi­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>The sooner con­sumers know about their data be­ing lost, the sooner they can pro­tect them­selves. Even if there is no “harm”, re­quir­ing or­gan­i­sa­tions to re­port on breaches im­proves ac­count­abil­ity and trans­parency – ul­ti­mately in­creas­ing trust.</p>
    <p>But where to set the thresh­old? Too low and ev­ery time an e-mail is mis­di­rected a no­ti­fi­ca­tion must be sub­mit­ted – the Per­sonal Data Pro­tec­tion Com­mis­sion will be buried in re­ports. Too high and breaches that fore­shadow sys­temic risks may be missed.</p>
    <p>The amend­ments pro­pose that breaches must be re­ported if they are “likely” to cause “sig­nif­i­cant harm” or af­fect a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of in­di­vid­u­als – likely set at 500. “Sig­nif­i­cant harm” ap­pears broader than the GDPR thresh­old of “high risk” to a per­son’s rights and may need to be clar­i­fied in prac­tice.</p>
    <p>In most cir­cum­stances, the or­gan­i­sa­tion must no­tify af­fected in­di­vid­u­als “as soon as prac­ti­ca­ble” and ad­vise the com­mis­sion within three days.</p>
    <p>Another wel­come in­crease in ac­count­abil­ity is that in­di­vid­u­als will be held per­son­ally re­spon­si­ble if they know­ingly or reck­lessly use or dis­close per­sonal data with­out au­tho­ri­sa­tion – with penal­ties of up to a $5,000 fine or two years’ im­pris­on­ment.</p>
    <p>This mir­rors the penal­ties for pub­lic of­fi­cers in­tro­duced two years ago in the Pub­lic Sec­tor (Gov­er­nance) Act, which is broadly aligned with the PDPA. (Sin­ga­pore is un­usual in that the PDPA ex­empts pub­lic agen­cies from cov­er­age, though the Gov­ern­ment has long ar­gued that in­ter­nal man­u­als and leg­is­la­tion such as the Of­fi­cial Se­crets Act pro­vide ad­e­quate pro­tec­tion.)</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>DRIVEN BY DATA</p>
    <p>While the GDPR’s ex­plicit pur­pose is to pro­tect hu­man rights, Sin­ga­pore’s PDPA was al­ways a prag­matic com­pro­mise between the rights of in­di­vid­u­als and de­vel­op­ing the dig­i­tal econ­omy. That raises the third ques­tion: What does all this mean for busi­ness?</p>
    <p>The net im­pact of the changes should make it clearer to or­gan­i­sa­tions when they can use data.</p>
    <p>Rather than adding fine print to con­tracts that no one reads, they can use data an­a­lyt­ics for busi­ness im­prove­ment pur­poses, rely on a le­git­i­mate in­ter­est ex­cep­tion to guard against fraud or abuse, and use deemed con­sent to cover the mul­ti­ple lay­ers of com­mer­cial partnershi­ps that un­der­pin the pur­chase and de­liv­ery of goods on­line.</p>
    <p>For con­sumers, it should mean more per­son­alised ser­vices – with porta­bil­ity obli­ga­tions in­creas­ing com­pe­ti­tion by low­er­ing en­try bar­ri­ers and en­abling users to move their data if they are un­happy or want to try some­thing new.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>DO NOT DIS­TURB</p>
    <p>A fi­nal change might have been the most wel­come: Clos­ing the gap between the Spam Con­trol Act and the Do Not Call Reg­istry. Un­til now this left out some in­stant mes­sag­ing ser­vices such as WeChat and Tele­gram.</p>
    <p>It’s a step in the right di­rec­tion, but users will still need to go to the Per­sonal Data Pro­tec­tion Com­mis­sion for un­so­licited mar­ket­ing calls and texts, while scams and loan sharks must be re­ported to the po­lice.</p>
    <p>As for e-mail and other kinds of spam, en­force­ment is the­o­ret­i­cally pos­si­ble and penal­ties are in­creased – but you’re bet­ter off in­vest­ing in a de­cent fil­ter and block­ing irk­some ac­counts.</p>
    <p>Per­haps rec­on­cil­ing th­ese prob­lems could be the fo­cus of fu­ture amend­ments.</p>
    <p>There is a les­son here, how­ever. Laws like data pro­tec­tion work best when they are seen least.</p>
    <p>The pur­pose of data pro­tec­tion law is not to pre­serve pri­vacy as such but to give users rea­son­able con­trol over their data, reap­ing the ben­e­fits of the in­for­ma­tion econ­omy while mit­i­gat­ing the risks and min­imis­ing the has­sle.</p>
    <p>So no, data isn’t the new oil. Or if it is like oil, it’s a lu­bri­cant rather than a fuel – not con­sumed to power the dig­i­tal econ­omy, but en­abling it and ac­cel­er­at­ing it.</p>
    <p>Be cau­tious, how­ever. Be­cause if you spread it around too lib­er­ally, you might just slip and fall on your face.</p>
