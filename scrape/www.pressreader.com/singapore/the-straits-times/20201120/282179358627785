    <p>Bees are the most im­por­tant pol­li­na­tor, with a cru­cial role in pro­duc­ing fruit and veg­eta­bles that feed peo­ple, yet lit­tle is known about their distributi­on be­yond North Amer­ica, Europe and Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>To pave the way for in-depth stud­ies and con­ser­va­tion of the more than 20,300 species world­wide, re­searchers from four na­tions, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, have plot­ted the first “bee map” to chart the crea­tures’ di­ver­sity across the con­ti­nents.</p>
    <p>The global map is made up of sev­eral oth­ers, and the re­searchers be­lieve one of them is a first for in­ver­te­brates in track­ing the species’ rich­ness at a na­tional, sub-na­tional or state level.</p>
    <p>The map – built from hun­dreds of thou­sands of global records and spec­i­mens, and al­most six mil­lion records from pub­lic data­bases that were ver­i­fied – re­vealed gap­ing holes in cur­rently known pat­terns about bee di­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>“Bees are re­ported to be in de­cline world­wide. And I say ‘re­ported’ rather than con­firm­ing they are be­cause a lot of these re­ports are based in the Nether­lands, Eng­land or the US,” said As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor John Ascher from the de­part­ment of bi­o­log­i­cal sciences at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“They’re re­port­ing global de­clines but their data set is not re­ally global,” added Prof Ascher, who is one of the project’s re­searchers and the main data provider for the bee map.</p>
    <p>The other re­searchers are from China, Bri­tain and the United States. Their research pa­per with the map is pub­lished in the jour­nal Cur­rent Bi­ol­ogy to­day.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, global rep­re­sen­ta­tion of bee species was skewed.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the map shows that 15 per cent of the species are found in Asia, but only 1 per cent of the re­gion’s species were shown in the pub­lic data­bases on­line.</p>
    <p>The map also con­firmed some hy­pothe­ses about bee hot spots.</p>
    <p>Most plants and an­i­mals are more di­verse in the trop­i­cal ar­eas, but bees are more preva­lent in re­gions that are nei­ther too trop­i­cal nor too cold. These re­gions in­clude deserts and wine-grow­ing places such as France and Ar­gentina.</p>
    <p>Prof Ascher said: “Know­ing this is very im­por­tant for con­ser­va­tion­ists be­cause they may think: ‘If we want to con­serve bio­di­ver­sity, we need to save the rain­for­est.’</p>
    <p>“In ad­di­tion to the rain­forests, we need to con­serve places in the Mid­dle East.”</p>
    <p>Since most bees nest i n the ground, their lar­vae can be killed by fungi or harmed by wet soil in rain­forests.</p>
    <p>Mov­ing for­ward, the re­searchers hope that the map will be a spring­board for ex­perts to zero in on a par­tic­u­lar re­gion.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, sci­en­tists can visit farm­ing ar­eas with low bee di­ver­sity, and find out from local ex­perts if the lack of bees is caus­ing a food se­cu­rity risk. From there, the sci­en­tists and local ex­perts can come up with so­lu­tions to main­tain pol­li­na­tion, he added.</p>
    <p>Pol­li­na­tion ecol­o­gist Stephen Buch­mann from the Univer­sity of Ari­zona said bee biologists can also map out bee traits and be­hav­iours in the same way Prof Ascher and his team have done.</p>
    <p>The map also con­firmed some hy­pothe­ses about bee hot spots. Most plants and an­i­mals are more di­verse in the trop­i­cal ar­eas, but bees are more preva­lent in re­gions that are nei­ther too trop­i­cal nor too cold. These re­gions in­clude deserts and wine-grow­ing places.</p>
