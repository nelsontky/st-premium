    <p>To cre­ate age-friendly work­places, em­ploy­ers must end age bias in re­cruit­ment and dis­card any neg­a­tive stereo­types they may have against se­nior work­ers. The Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Fair & Pro­gres­sive Em­ploy­ment Prac­tices (Tafep) calls on em­ploy­ers to be pro­gres­sive in hir­ing se­nior work­ers and cre­at­ing an age-friendly work­place where se­nior work­ers can thrive As a busi­ness owner, I am con­cerned about whether se­nior work­ers can adapt in a fast­paced and some­times phys­i­cally de­mand­ing work en­vi­ron­ment. How can I hire se­nior work­ers and help them to in­te­grate quickly ?</p>
    <p>The process of hir­ing on merit — rather than fo­cus­ing on age — can pay off in sev­eral ways, such as earn­ing greater re­spect from your em­ploy­ees and mo­ti­vat­ing them to do their best at work .</p>
    <p>Here are some ideas on how em­ploy­ers can mod­ify and up­lift their prac­tices to em­brace se­nior work­ers. Adopt fair hir­ing prac­tices</p>
    <p>Firstly, en­sure that the rest of your man­age­ment shares a fair and pro­gres­sive mind­set in hir­ing se­nior work­ers by re­view­ing your screen­ing cri­te­ria. You can in­di­cate in your job ad­ver­tise­ments that your po­si­tions are suit­able for se­nior work­ers.</p>
    <p>Adopt­ing the Tri­par­tite Stan­dard on Age-Friendly Work­place Prac­tices will also dis­tin­guish you from other em­ploy­ers on the MyCa­reer­sFu­ture por­tal. Pro­vide train­ing and devel­op­ment</p>
    <p>To better in­te­grate se­nior work­ers, of­fer them the same guid­ance and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for ca­reer devel­op­ment that your younger em­ploy­ees might have ac­cess to. In this dig­i­tal era, en­cour­age those who are stronger in the rel­e­vant skills to help train oth­ers. Where pos­si­ble, pair up se­nior and younger em­ploy­ees to fos­ter a spirit of team­work and men­tor­ing. Cre­ate an in­clu­sive work­place and cul­ture</p>
    <p>Re­design­ing the work­place on or­gan­i­sa­tional and sys­tems lev­els to cre­ate eas­ier, safer and smarter jobs can help se­nior work­ers im­mensely and max­imise their po­ten­tial at work. Be­yond that, you can also fa­cil­i­tate multi-gen­er­a­tional bond­ing among your em­ploy­ees through recre­ational ac­tiv­i­ties. As a se­nior look­ing to re-en­ter the work­force, how should I start?</p>
    <p>Older job seek­ers can do their part by adopt­ing a pos­i­tive mind­set and be­ing open to ex­plor­ing new ar­eas. Here are some steps to get you started. Stay rel­e­vant</p>
    <p>To seek as­sis­tance in sign­ing up for train­ing pro­grammes to gain new skills, you may tap Skill­sFu­ture Ad­vice (SFA) or ap­proach the Na­tional Sil­ver Academy (NSA). Both providers of­fer a wide range of re­sources and learn­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties to get you better equipped. Come pre­pared</p>
    <p>Read up about your prospec­tive em­ployer and un­der­stand what they do be­fore at­tend­ing a job in­ter­view. You can find this in­for­ma­tion on the com­pany ’s web­site or their LinkedIn page. You can also book a one-toone ses­sion with e2i’s Em­ploy­a­bil­ity Coach to im­prove your in­ter­view­ing skills. Com­mu­ni­cate clearly</p>
    <p>If you are tran­si­tion­ing to a new role or in­dus­try, find out more about the de­mands of the job from your po­ten­tial em­ployer. Should you be open to tak­ing up new roles or join­ing new in­dus­tries, make your flex­i­bil­ity known. If you face con­straints that might hin­der your tran­si­tion, try rais­ing them to your in­ter­viewer to dis­cuss how the con­cerns can be worked out for both par­ties. Keep an open mind</p>
    <p>Se­nior work­ers re­turn­ing to the work­force may find them­selves work­ing along­side fresh grad­u­ates or reporting to some­one younger. Ap­pre­ci­ate the strengths of your younger col­leagues and ex­change your knowl­edge or skills with one an­other. Multi-gen­er­a­tional team­work can pro­duce great syn­ergy. I am in my 40s and re­cently at­tended a job in­ter­view where the hir­ing man­ager told me they pre­fer some­one more en­er­getic. Is this con­sid­ered age dis­crim­i­na­tion?</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers should hire on the ba­sis of merit and avoid stat­ing age lim­its dur­ing se­lec­tion or re­cruit­ment.</p>
    <p>In this case, the em­ployer needs to explain or elab­o­rate on their def­i­ni­tion of “more en­er­getic” and if there is a screen­ing test to ob­jec­tively de­ter­mine so. If the em­ployer re­quires em­ploy­ees to only come from a spe­cific age group, then the em­ployer must jus­tify why an em­ployee’s age af­fects his or her abil­ity to per­form the job.</p>
    <p>Tafep works closely with the Min­istry of Man­power to take ac­tion against dis­crim­i­na­tory em­ploy­ers, in­clud­ing sus­pend­ing their work pass priv­i­leges.</p>
