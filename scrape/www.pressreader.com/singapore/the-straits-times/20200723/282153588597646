    <p>I al­ways see lessons for Sin­ga­pore foot­ball in the English foot­ball leagues, and much can be learnt from them.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond-tier Cham­pi­onship side Leeds United will re­turn to the top flight of English foot­ball next sea­son (Leeds ready to soar once again, July 20).</p>
    <p>That Leeds United fans have been doggedly sup­port­ing their club de­spite years of un­der­achieve­ment – the club went into ad­min­is­tra­tion and was rel­e­gated to the third tier of English foot­ball in 2007 – shows the im­por­tance of fans to a club’s suc­cess and stay­ing power, and fan en­gage­ment is ob­vi­ously a huge part of that.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a study done by Cana­dian cus­tomer re­la­tion­ship in­tel­li­gence soft­ware com­pany Vi­sion Crit­i­cal, for in­stance, sports teams need to step up their game to more ef­fec­tively en­gage their fans – only a third of fans were found to agree that the sports teams they sup­port ac­tu­ally en­gage them by lis­ten­ing to their opin­ion.</p>
    <p>En­gag­ing the fans is im­por­tant as it is what en­ables sports teams to mea­sure and in­crease brand value, to de­velop a brand im­age that res­onates with the fans, and is the driver be­hind sta­dium at­ten­dance and ticket and mer­chan­dise sales.</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional con­sul­tancy Gensler also found that it be­hoves sports teams to con­nect with the fans be­yond just a great match-day ex­pe­ri­ence – for in­stance, through apps and other forms of round-the-clock on­line en­gage­ment, and by giv­ing fans some­thing to be proud of, which could be a great sta­dium with pos­i­tive vibes or giv­ing back to the lo­cal com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Fans want to be en­gaged by their sports teams at deeper de­ci­sion-mak­ing lev­els, and want to have a say on mat­ters con­cern­ing team and game-re­lated is­sues.</p>
    <p>Fans of Sin­ga­pore foot­ball have long ex­pressed that they want to ex­pe­ri­ence more en­gage­ment from the league (Fans want to see more en­gage­ment, Nov 6, 2018).</p>
    <p>As na­tional foot­ball coach Tat­suma Yoshida has ar­tic­u­lated, we are on the same team (Yoshida hails front-line work­ers as ‘Lions’, March 27), and with the restart of the Sin­ga­pore Premier League sea­son soon to be un­der way, Sin­ga­pore foot­ball can grow from strength to strength with the un­equiv­o­cal sup­port of de­lighted and fully en­gaged fans as the 12th man on the team.</p>
