    <p>For Is­abelle Chan, eight, and her six-year-old sis­ter, Natalya, the high­light of their In­side Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) tour was when they got to serve food and drinks to their mother while dressed in the air­line’s iconic sarong ke­baya.</p>
    <p>The two girls were among 500 par­tic­i­pants who se­cured a slot for the first tour ses­sion, which was held yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Their mother, Mrs Rowena Chan, said: “I thought it’d be good for them to have a chance to ex­pe­ri­ence it be­hind the scenes.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think this is nor­mally open to the pub­lic, and since there was an op­por­tu­nity, I de­cided to go ahead and book this ex­pe­ri­ence for them,” added the 44-year-old ex­ec­u­tive as­sis­tant.</p>
    <p>The girls donned the sarong ke­baya and learnt cus­tomer ser­vice skills from SIA stew­ardesses as part of the ju­nior cabin crew ex­pe­ri­ence, one of the add-on op­tions of the tour pro­gramme, which pro­vides vis­i­tors with a look around SIA’s train­ing cen­tre in Changi.</p>
    <p>A ba­sic tour ticket to the cen­tre, which is nor­mally closed to the pub­lic, costs $30 for those aged 12 and above, and $15 for chil­dren aged three to 12, ex­clud­ing goods and ser­vices tax (GST).</p>
    <p>The ju­nior cabin crew ex­pe­ri­ence costs $88, ex­clud­ing GST, and in­cludes the SIA sarong ke­baya.</p>
    <p>The na­tional car­rier is op­er­at­ing four ses­sions of the In­side SIA tour over two week­ends – yes­ter­day and to­day, as well as on Nov 28 and 29. Each ses­sion has a max­i­mum ca­pac­ity of 500 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>More than 20,000 peo­ple had ex­pressed in­ter­est in the tour, said SIA chief ex­ec­u­tive Goh Choon Phong.</p>
    <p>“We are go­ing to fo­cus on mak­ing sure that who­ever vis­its us gets a great ex­pe­ri­ence,” he added.</p>
    <p>De­spite the over­whelm­ing re­sponse, he said the air­line has no plans to open up fur­ther ses­sions for now.</p>
    <p>As part of the tour, par­tic­i­pants get a look at pi­lot and cabin crew train­ing, such as for emer­gency sit­u­a­tions when the plane lands on wa­ter, as well as take part in craft ac­tiv­i­ties like bal­loon sculpt­ing.</p>
    <p>One of SIA’s lat­est train­ing equip­ment, which sim­u­lates sit­u­a­tions where the air­craft lands on wa­ter, was on dis­play. The large metal con­tainer re­sem­bles part of a cabin. It is ex­pected to be com­mis­sioned and used for train­ing from next year.</p>
    <p>The car­rier also launched a new range of dishes for flights last­ing less than 31/ hours in econ­omy</p>
    <p>2 class yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Among the food op­tions on ro­ta­tion are Sin­ga­pore favourites such as laksa and mee siam, which were not pre­vi­ously avail­able in econ­omy class, SIA said.</p>
    <p>The air­line has also re­placed its plas­tic serv­ing ware with a new pack­ag­ing so­lu­tion, which in­cludes a bam­boo cut­lery pack and a leak-proof pa­per box for all short-haul econ­omy flights.</p>
    <p>This means that the air­line is now able to serve soup and other liq­uid items, which the pre­vi­ous serv­ing ware could not ac­com­mo­date.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the air­line said the new serv­ing ware re­duces the amount of sin­gle-use plas­tics on the meal tray by 80 per cent, based on the weight of the items.</p>
    <p>There are other ben­e­fits, the air­line said.</p>
    <p>Leftovers on the tray, in­clud­ing the serv­ing ware, will be taken back to ground han­dler Sats’ Sin­ga­pore fa­cil­ity and con­verted into pel­lets that can be used as al­ter­na­tive fuel.</p>
    <p>On-site pro­cess­ing of waste re­duces about 60 per cent of cater­ing waste and also emis­sions from trans­port­ing waste to the in­cin­er­a­tor.</p>
    <p>The lighter pa­per pack­ag­ing also helps to re­duce fuel con­sump­tion on flights, SIA noted.</p>
    <p>RARE OP­POR­TU­NITY</p>
    <p>I thought it’d be good for them to have a chance to ex­pe­ri­ence it be­hind the scenes. I don’t think this is nor­mally open to the pub­lic, and since there was an op­por­tu­nity, I de­cided to go ahead and book this ex­pe­ri­ence for them.’’</p>
    <p>MRS ROWENA CHAN, whose daugh­ters Is­abelle and Natalya were among 500 par­tic­i­pants who took part in yes­ter­day’s In­side SIA tour.</p>
    <p>GREAT EX­PE­RI­ENCE FOR ALL</p>
    <p>We are go­ing to fo­cus on mak­ing sure that who­ever vis­its us gets a great ex­pe­ri­ence.’’</p>
