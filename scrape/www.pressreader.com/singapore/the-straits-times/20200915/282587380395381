    <p>TEL AVIV • An Is­raeli court on Sun­day sen­tenced the coun­try’s most fa­mous model, Bar Re­faeli (left), to nine months of com­mu­nity ser­vice and a large fine for tax eva­sion.</p>
    <p>Re­faeli, who in the past dated Hol­ly­wood ac­tor Leonardo DiCaprio, was con­victed in July of giv­ing false state­ments about her pe­ri­ods of over­seas res­i­dence in or­der to evade Is­raeli taxes.</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old, a mother of three, was in court wear­ing a face mask to hear her sen­tence.</p>
    <p>She was fined 2.5 mil­lion shekels (S$991,000) and or­dered to pay ar­rears, ac­cord­ing to the de­ci­sion is­sued by the court, con­firm­ing an ear­lier plea bar­gain.</p>
    <p>Re­faeli’s com­mu­nity ser­vice will be at a facility in a Tel Aviv sub­urb aid­ing peo­ple with se­vere phys­i­cal and men­tal dis­abil­i­ties, be­gin­ning next Mon­day, ac­cord­ing to the rul­ing.</p>
    <p>Is­raeli cit­i­zens who are not res­i­dents are ex­empt from re­port­ing in­come from out­side the coun­try to Is­rael’s tax au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Her mother, Mrs Tzipi Re­faeli, was sen­tenced to 16 months in prison over mul­ti­ple tax charges.</p>
    <p>She was also or­dered to pay 2.5 mil­lion shekels in ad­di­tion to tax ar­rears.</p>
    <p>The rul­ing ends a long-run­ning case in which the model was first ar­rested and ques­tioned in De­cem­ber 2015.</p>
    <p>The swim­suit model stirred con­tro­versy when she evaded her two years of manda­tory Is­raeli mil­i­tary ser­vice by mar­ry­ing a friend of her father’s, only to divorce him a short while later. She is mar­ried to Is­raeli busi­ness­man Adi Ezra.</p>
