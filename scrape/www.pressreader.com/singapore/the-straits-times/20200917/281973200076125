    <p>PORT­LAND (Ore­gon) • Thou­sands of evac­uees dis­placed by deadly wild­fires in Ore­gon set­tled into a sec­ond week of life in shel­ters and car camp­ing as fire crews bat­tled on, while search teams scoured the ru­ins of in­cin­er­ated homes for the miss­ing.</p>
    <p>With state re­sources stretched to their limit, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump on Tues­day ap­proved a re­quest from Ore­gon’s gover­nor for a fed­eral dis­as­ter dec­la­ra­tion, bol­ster­ing US gov­ern­ment as­sis­tance for emer­gency re­sponse and re­lief ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Dozens of fires have charred some 1.8 mil­lion hectares of tin­derdry brush, grass and wood­lands in Ore­gon, Cal­i­for­nia and Wash­ing­ton state since Au­gust, rav­aging sev­eral small towns, de­stroy­ing thou­sands of homes and killing at least 34 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Eight deaths have been con­firmed dur­ing the past week in Ore­gon, which be­came the lat­est and most con­cen­trated hot spot in a larger sum­mer out­break of fires across the en­tire western United States. The Pa­cific North-west was hard­est hit.</p>
    <p>The con­fla­gra­tions, which of­fi­cials and sci­en­tists have de­scribed as un­prece­dented in scope and fe­roc­ity, have filled the re­gion’s skies with smoke and soot, com­pound­ing a pub­lic health cri­sis al­ready posed by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Satel­lite images showed high-alti</p>
    <p>tude plumes of smoke from the fires drift­ing as far east as New York City and Wash­ing­ton DC, car­ried aloft by the jet stream.</p>
    <p>The fires roared to life in Cal­i­for­nia in mid-Au­gust, and erupted across Ore­gon and Wash­ing­ton around Labour Day last week, many of them sparked by cat­a­strophic light­ning storms and stoked by record-break­ing heat waves and bouts of howl­ing winds.</p>
    <p>Weather con­di­tions im­proved early this week, en­abling fire­fight­ers to be­gin to make head­way in ef­forts to contain and tamp down the blazes.</p>
    <p>The Cal­i­for­nia De­part­ment of Forestry and Fire Pro­tec­tion (CalFire) said 16,600 fire­fight­ers were still bat­tling 25 ma­jor fires on Tues­day, after achiev­ing full con­tain­ment around the perime­ter of other large blazes. Fire­fight­ers in the San Gabriel Moun­tains just north of Los</p>
    <p>An­ge­les waged an all-out cam­paign to save the famed Mount Wil­son Observator­y and an ad­ja­cent com­plex of broad­cast trans­mis­sion tow­ers from flames that crept to within 150m of the site.</p>
    <p>At least 25 peo­ple have per­ished in Cal­i­for­nia’s wild­fires in the past four weeks, while more than 4,200 homes and other build­ings have gone up in smoke, CalFire re­ported.</p>
    <p>Nearly 1.2 mil­lion ha in Cal­i­for­nia alone have been rav­aged by fires – more than in any sin­gle year in its his­tory – and five of the 20 largest wild­fires on record in the state have oc­curred dur­ing that time frame.</p>
    <p>One wildfire fa­tal­ity has been con­firmed in Wash­ing­ton state, where some 400 struc­tures have been lost.</p>
    <p>Roughly 400,000 ha have been black­ened in Ore­gon, dou­ble the state’s an­nual av­er­age over the past decade. At the height of the cri­sis there, some 500,000 res­i­dents – or at least 10 per cent of the state’s pop­u­la­tion – were un­der some form of evac­u­a­tion alert, many forced to flee their homes as swiftly ad­vanc­ing flames closed in on their neigh­bour­hoods.</p>
    <p>More than 1,700 struc­tures, most of them dwellings, have been in­cin­er­ated. At last count, some 16 peo­ple re­ported miss­ing re­mained un­ac­counted for in Ore­gon, emer­gency man­age­ment of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>Last week, the au­thor­i­ties said they were brac­ing them­selves for pos­si­ble mass ca­su­al­ties as search teams be­gan comb­ing wreck­age of de­stroyed homes.</p>
    <p>In the fire-stricken south-western Ore­gon town of Phoenix, up­rooted fam­i­lies, many with young chil­dren, were sleep­ing in their cars, hud­dling at a civic cen­tre or in churches, city coun­cil mem­ber Sarah Westover said. Ms Westover said her com­mu­nity was in grief, while fear­ing that a flare-up might force them to flee again.</p>
    <p>Her house in Phoenix was spared, but oth­ers nearby were lev­elled. “It’s much more dif­fi­cult to fol­low the Covid re­stric­tions given the en­vi­ron­ment,” Ms Westover said.</p>
    <p>At least 25 peo­ple have per­ished in Cal­i­for­nia’s wild­fires in the past four weeks, while more than 4,200 homes and other build­ings have gone up in smoke, CalFire re­ported.</p>
