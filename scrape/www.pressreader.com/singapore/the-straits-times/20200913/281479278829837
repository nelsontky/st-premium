    <p>SACRA­MENTO (Cal­i­for­nia) • Wild­fires that have al­ready de­stroyed at least half a dozen small towns in the north-west­ern United States raged largely un­con­trolled on Fri­day as Cal­i­for­nia’s gov­er­nor called the fire sea­son ev­i­dence of a cli­mate emer­gency.</p>
    <p>Fires in Cal­i­for­nia, Ore­gon and Wash­ing­ton have torn through idyl­lic moun­tain towns, re­duced neigh­bour­hoods to ash and spewed so much smoke that pi­lots were un­able to pur­sue aerial at­tacks that can be crit­i­cal in pre­vent­ing such mass wild­fires from en­croach­ing on com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Com­bined, the states have seen nearly 2 mil­lion ha con­sumed by fire – a land mass ap­proach­ing the size of New Jer­sey – in a record­set­ting year that sci­en­tists think por­tends the types of dis­as­ters that will be­come more com­mon on a warm­ing planet.</p>
    <p>“This is a cli­mate damn emer­gency. This is real and it’s hap­pen­ing. This is the per­fect storm,” Cal­i­for­nia gov­er­nor Gavin New­som told re­porters from a charred moun­tain­side near Oroville, Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>He ac­knowl­edged that poor for­est man­age­ment over decades had con­trib­uted to the sever­ity of the state’s wild­fires in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>But he said se­ri­ous droughts and record-break­ing heat waves were un­de­ni­able ev­i­dence that many of the most dire pre­dic­tions about cli­mate change had al­ready ar­rived.</p>
    <p>“Cal­i­for­nia is Amer­ica in fast for­ward,” he said. “What we’re ex­pe­ri­enc­ing right now is com­ing to com­mu­ni­ties all across the coun­try.”</p>
    <p>The fires have caused the loss of hun­dreds, if not thou­sands, of homes, most of them in Ore­gon, where an es­ti­mated 40,000 peo­ple have been evac­u­ated and as many as 500,000 live in evac­u­a­tion alert zones, poised to flee with a change in the winds.</p>
    <p>PORT­LAND (Ore­gon) • Deadly wild­fires rag­ing across Ore­gon have kept half a mil­lion peo­ple un­der evac­u­a­tion alert even as weary fire­fight­ers took ad­van­tage of i mproved weather to go on the of­fen­sive against the blazes on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The fires have de­stroyed thou­sands of homes in days, mak­ing Ore­gon the lat­est epi­cen­tre in a larger sum­mer out­break of fires sweep­ing the West Coast of the United States, killing at least 25 peo­ple and col­lec­tively scorch­ing a land­scape the size of New Jer­sey.</p>
    <p>At least five peo­ple died in Ore­gon this past week, and Gov­er­nor Kate Brown has warned that the death toll could be far higher. She said on Fri­day that dozens of peo­ple had been re­ported miss­ing in three coun­ties in the state.</p>
    <p>Ore­gon Of­fice of Emer­gency Man­age­ment chief An­drew Phelps said disas­ter teams search­ing the scorched ru­ins of a half-dozen small towns laid to waste were brac­ing them­selves to en­counter pos­si­ble “mass fa­tal­ity in­ci­dents”.</p>
    <p>The Pa­cific North-West­ern re­gion as a whole has borne the brunt of an in­cen­di­ary on­slaught that be­gan around Labour Day, last Mon­day, dark­en­ing the sky with smoke and ash that has be­set north­ern Cal­i­for­nia, Ore­gon and Wash­ing­ton state with some of the world’s worst air-qual­ity lev­els.</p>
    <p>The firestorms, some of the largest on record in Cal­i­for­nia and Ore­gon, were driven by high winds that howled across the re­gion for days in the midst of record-break­ing heat.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists say global warm­ing has also con­trib­uted to ex­tremes in wet and dry sea­sons, caus­ing veg­e­ta­tion to flour­ish then dry out, leav­ing more abun­dant fuel for wild­fires.</p>
    <p>“This is a cli­mate... emer­gency. This is real and it’s hap­pen­ing. This is the per­fect storm,” Cal­i­for­nia Gov­er­nor Gavin New­som told re­porters from a charred moun­tain­side near Oroville in the state.</p>
    <p>More than 3,900 homes and other struc­tures have been in­cin­er­ated in Cal­i­for­nia alone over the past three weeks.</p>
    <p>In south­ern Ore­gon, an apoc­a­lyp­tic scene of charred res­i­den­tial sub­di­vi­sions and trailer parks stretched for kilo­me­tres along High­way 99 south of Med­ford through the neigh­bour­ing towns of Phoenix and Tal­ent, one of the most dev­as­tated ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Molalla, a com­mu­nity about 40km south of down­town Port­land, was an ash-cov­ered ghost town af­ter its more than 9,000 res­i­dents were told to evac­u­ate, with only 30 re­fus­ing to leave, the city’s fire de­part­ment said.</p>
    <p>The log­ging town was on the front line of a vast evac­u­a­tion zone stretch­ing north to within 5km of down­town Port­land. The sher­iff in sub­ur­ban Clacka­mas County has set a 10pm cur­few to de­ter “pos­si­ble in­creased crim­i­nal ac­tiv­ity”.</p>
    <p>Ore­gon’s Gov­er­nor Brown told a news con­fer­ence that more than 500,000 peo­ple were un­der one of three evac­u­a­tion alert lev­els, ad­vis­ing them to pack and be vig­i­lant, and to be ready to flee at a mo­ment’s no­tice, or to leave im­me­di­ately. About 40,000 of those had al­ready been or­dered to leave.</p>
    <p>In neigh­bour­ing Wash­ing­ton state, on­line video from the Ta­coma area showed fires in a res­i­den­tial area set­ting homes ablaze and lo­cals scur­ry­ing to warn their neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>“Every­body out, every­body out!” a man screamed as fire­fight­ers tried to douse the flames.</p>
    <p>Af­ter four days of treach­er­ously hot, windy weather, a glim­mer of hope ar­rived on Fri­day in the form of calmer winds blow­ing in from the ocean, bring­ing cooler, more moist con­di­tions that helped fire­fight­ers make head­way against blazes that had burned l argely unchecked ear­lier in the week.</p>
    <p>“The weather is go­ing to be favourable for us,” said Mr Doug Grafe, fire pro­tec­tion chief for the Ore­gon De­part­ment of Forestry, adding t hat t he break i n t he weather was fore­cast to con­tinue into this week.</p>
    <p>The over­all death toll from the West Coast fires that be­gan last month jumped to 25 af­ter seven peo­ple were re­ported killed in moun­tains north of Sacra­mento, Cal­i­for­nia, and Ore­gon’s fifth fa­tal­ity was re­ported in Mar­ion County, out­side of Salem, the state cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Par­adise, a town dev­as­tated by Cal­i­for­nia’s dead­li­est wild­fire in 2018, has posted the world’s worst air qual­ity in­dex read­ing at 592, ac­cord­ing to the Pur­pleAir mon­i­tor­ing site, as two of the state’s largest blazes burned on ei­ther side of it.</p>
    <p>In south­ern Ore­gon, po­lice ar­rested a 42-year-old man on Fri­day for start­ing a fire in the town of Phoenix, the Jack­son County Sher­iff’s of­fice said.</p>
    <p>The sus­pect, iden­ti­fied as Michael Bakkela and de­scribed as a “lo­cal tran­sient”, has been charged with ar­son, crim­i­nal mis­chief and reck­less en­dan­ger­ing, the of­fice said in a press re­lease.</p>
