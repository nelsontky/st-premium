    <p>One way to pro­mote fair treat­ment of vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple is to de­velop a set of em­ploy­ment guide­lines. How­ever, for guide­lines to work there must be a com­mon un­der­stand­ing and ac­cep­tance of the fun­da­men­tal prin­ci­ples be­ing ap­plied and of the sit­u­a­tion or med­i­cal con­di­tion be­ing ad­dressed (Work­place dis­crim­i­na­tion: Dis­putes best solved am­i­ca­bly, Nov 5).</p>
    <p>There are two fun­da­men­tal prin­ci­ples that should stand be­hind our ef­forts to im­prove the em­ploy­ment prospects of peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties, chronic ill­nesses such as epilepsy and men­tal health is­sues.</p>
    <p>A greater aware­ness in so­ci­ety of the needs of peo­ple with epilepsy, be­yond seizure con­trol, and a plea for them to be lis­tened to, must be taken se­ri­ously. Many peo­ple with epilepsy are un­nec­es­sar­ily re­stricted in their choice of em­ploy­ment due to ig­no­rance about the con­di­tion and the stigma as­so­ci­ated with it.</p>
    <p>First, peo­ple with epilepsy and dis­abil­i­ties, and oth­ers with their spe­cific con­cerns, should have the same rights as oth­ers to equal op­por­tu­nity in train­ing and em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, th­ese peo­ple should be re­garded as hav­ing equal value. That is to say, tal­ents are de­vel­oped and weak­nesses com­pen­sated for.</p>
    <p>Th­ese fun­da­men­tal prin­ci­ples pro­tect so­ci­ety from the dan­ger of gen­er­al­i­sa­tion. From here, it is pos­si­ble to de­velop a set of em­ploy­ment guide­lines to pro­mote the fair treat­ment of peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties and oth­ers. The first thing that is needed is to have an agreed un­der­stand­ing of what the dis­abil­ity is and the prob­lems that it may cre­ate at work.</p>
    <p>The is­sues faced by some­one with epilepsy are di­verse and in­di­vid­ual.</p>
    <p>We en­cour­age em­ploy­ers to in­clude prin­ci­ples of good prac­tice that will lead to in­di­vid­u­alised so­lu­tions that help to avoid the em­ploy­ment prob­lems that are cre­ated by stigma and ig­no­rance.</p>
    <p>We look for­ward to hav­ing a so­ci­ety where di­ver­sity, equity and in­clu­sive­ness are val­ued.</p>
