    <p>Jump­ing i nto ro­bot­ics with no back­ground ex­pe­ri­ence sounds like a tall or­der, but Mr Mo­ham­mad Hasbi Mo­ham­mad Shazali, 31, rose to the chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>Mr Hasbi was laid off from his job in cor­po­rate sales at a ho­tel group in March.</p>
    <p>De­cid­ing to move into a growth area, he took the plunge and joined a soft­ware and ro­botic process au­to­ma­tion course as part of the SGUnited Mid-Ca­reer Path­ways Pro­gramme with PBA Ro­bot­ics. His course started last month and will end in March next year.</p>
    <p>He said: “I am ac­tu­ally very in­ter­ested in learn­ing data an­a­lyt­ics, data sciences as well as ma­chine learn­ing, as I saw a huge de­mand for th­ese skills. I strongly be­lieve that com­pa­nies will have a need to use big data to pro­pel them for­ward in terms of ef­fi­ciency, brand­ing and, even­tu­ally, profit.”</p>
    <p>To pre­pare, Mr Hasbi also took on­line cour­ses and watched YouTube videos to bone up on pro­gram­ming lan­guages such as Python and con­cepts like data sci­ence.</p>
    <p>“My back­ground was in banking and fi­nance, and not in en­gi­neer­ing or com­puter sci­ence. So it took me a while to un­der­stand and grasp the con­cepts and the lan­guages learnt through­out the course.</p>
    <p>“And, of course, I will be com­pet­ing with new grad­u­ates who spent a good num­ber of years learn­ing the sub­ject mat­ter as well as those who are al­ready ex­pe­ri­enced in this area,” he said of his job prospects.</p>
    <p>Still, Mr Hasbi said he re­mains mo­ti­vated to keep up­skilling. “I aim to be one of the key con­trib­u­tors in my team to push my fu­ture em­ployer for­ward through an­a­lyt­ics.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully the trainee­ship will open more doors for me in data an­a­lyt­ics and data sciences – be it in PBA Ro­bot­ics or not. Re­gard­less, I will con­tinue to dive deep into the sub­ject mat­ter.”</p>
