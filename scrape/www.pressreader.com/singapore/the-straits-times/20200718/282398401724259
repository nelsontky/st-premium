    <p>For his out­stand­ing ex­ploits dur­ing the just-ended 2019-20 rac­ing sea­son, mul­ti­ple Group 1 vic­tor Exultant earned the Hong Kong Horse of the Year award at a spe­cial pre­sen­ta­tion func­tion at Sha Tin Race­course on Thurs­day night.</p>
    <p>The Tony Cruz-trained six-yearold Ir­ish-bred geld­ing was also named Cham­pion Mid­dle-Dis­tance Horse and Cham­pion Stayer for the sec­ond con­sec­u­tive year.</p>
    <p>Exultant is the first horse since River Ver­don in 1991-92 to win the Horse of the Year ti­tle in the same sea­son af­ter cap­tur­ing both the Group 1 FWD Queen El­iz­a­beth II Cup and the Group 1 Stan­dard Char­tered Cham­pi­ons & Chater Cup.</p>
    <p>Only two other Hong Kong cham­pi­ons – Top Grade and Quicken Away – have achieved the same feat.</p>
    <p>Exultant, a five-time Group 1 win­ner, showed un­com­mon class and res­o­lu­tion dur­ing the cam­paign, in which he fin­ished in the frame in all of his seven starts.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to his two Group 1 wins, the Te­ofilo geld­ing also took the Group 2 Jockey Club Cup and the Group 3 Cen­te­nary Vase Hand­i­cap. He was placed in the Group 1 Longines Hong Kong Vase, the Group 1 Citi Hong Kong Gold Cup and the Group 3 Sa Sa Ladies’ Purse Hand­i­cap.</p>
    <p>Exultant is owned by Ed­die Wong Ming Chak and Wong Le­ung Sau Hing.</p>
    <p>Golden Sixty was the de­serv­ing win­ner of the newly in­tro­duced</p>
    <p>Four-Year-Old Cham­pion award.</p>
    <p>The Fran­cis Lui-trained gal­loper be­came only the sec­ond horse, af­ter Rap­per Dragon, to win all three legs of the Four-Year-Old Clas­sic Se­ries, in­clud­ing the BMW HK Derby.</p>
    <p>The Medaglia d’Oro geld­ing went through the sea­son un­beaten with seven wins. He also tasted his first</p>
    <p>Group suc­cess in the Group 3 Chi­nese Club Chal­lenge Cup Hand­i­cap.</p>
    <p>Lui’s sta­ble star matched bril­liance with ver­sa­til­ity, with his wins rang­ing from 1,200m to 2,000m.</p>
    <p>Golden Sixty also se­cured the bulk of the public vote to claim the Most Pop­u­lar Horse ti­tle.</p>
    <p>Two-time Hong Kong Horse of the Year Beauty Gen­er­a­tion lost his out­right crown, but was named Cham­pion Miler for a re­mark­able third sea­son in a row.</p>
    <p>The Road To Rock seven-yearold re­mained a sig­nif­i­cant force at the high­est level, and com­pleted a hat-trick of wins in the Group 1 Queen’s Sil­ver Ju­bilee Cup.</p>
    <p>Trainer John Moore’s sta­ble stand­out also won the Group 3 Cel­e­bra­tion Cup for the third time in suc­ces­sion. He earned three Group 1 plac­ings, with his sec­onds in the Stew­ards’ Cup and the FWD Cham­pi­ons Mile and third in the Longines Hong Kong Mile.</p>
    <p>Beat The Clock was named the Cham­pion Sprinter for the sec­ond year.</p>
    <p>The John Size-trained six-yearold was a dual Group 1 vic­tor this term, claim­ing the Longines Hong Kong Sprint and the Cen­te­nary Sprint Cup, which he also won in the 2018/19 sea­son.</p>
