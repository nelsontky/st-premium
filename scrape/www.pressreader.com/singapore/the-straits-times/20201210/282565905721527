    <p>The best thing about the Young Artist Award? “My mother will stop nagging me to find a proper job,” says Ir­fan with a laugh.</p>
    <p>Though, this story could be the way his mother learns about his award as he has not, at the time of this in­ter­view, told her about it.</p>
    <p>The multi-hy­phen­ate says mis­chie­vously that his mother’s friends will al­ways tell her when her son ap­pears in the news.</p>
    <p>On a more se­ri­ous note, he says: “This award val­i­dates the past 16 years of work­ing free­lance and try­ing to be hon­est with the work I cre­ate. More than any­thing, be­cause I wasn’t for­mally trained, this dis­solves my anx­i­eties about not be­ing qual­i­fied to do art.”</p>
    <p>Ir­fan holds a di­ploma in Ap­plied Food Science and Nu­tri­tion from Te­masek Polytech­nic, but the as­so­ciate di­rec­tor with Teater Eka­ma­tra has chalked up a di­verse re­sume, with roles in act­ing, lighting de­sign and di­rect­ing.</p>
    <p>His l at­est i nter­est is in the tra­di­tional art of mak yong, a dance drama form from Malaysia. He is hop­ing the grant from his award will en­able him to travel around South-east Asia to ex­plore tra­di­tional art forms and rit­ual heal­ing.</p>
    <p>He notes that these is­sues are es­pe­cially rel­e­vant to prac­ti­tion­ers and au­di­ences dur­ing the pan­demic – “the idea of per­for­mance as rit­ual heal­ing, as a form of cathar­sis, as ther­apy”.</p>
