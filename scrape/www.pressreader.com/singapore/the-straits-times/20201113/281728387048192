    <p>Deep­avali is not just In­dia’s most widely cel­e­brated fes­ti­val, but also the coun­try’s largest shop­ping event. This year, In­dian industry and the gov­ern­ment are hop­ing the fes­ti­val will re­vive an econ­omy still reel­ing from the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Fear­ing that the air pol­lu­tion from fire­crack­ers, which are set off in the mil­lions dur­ing Deep­avali, will worsen the pan­demic, sev­eral states, in­clud­ing Haryana, Kar­nataka, Ma­ha­rash­tra, Ra­jasthan and West Ben­gal, have re­stricted or banned their sale and use.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, the Na­tional Green Tri­bunal, a ded­i­cated en­vi­ron­men­tal court, or­dered a ban on all fire­crack­ers in all cities and towns proven to have poor air qual­ity. “Cit­i­zens are en­ti­tled to breathe fresh air,” said the court.</p>
    <p>Cel­e­bra­tions this year also carry the threat of a spike in Covid-19 in­fec­tions. Re­ported cases plum­meted in re­cent weeks but some epi­demi­ol­o­gists say this is more a re­sult of un­re­li­able test­ing. The public health au­thor­i­ties worry that mass gath­er­ings will be­come su­per-spreader events.</p>
    <p>On Oct 6, In­dia’s Health Min­istry is­sued guide­lines on preven­tive mea­sures dur­ing fes­tiv­i­ties, which in­clude phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing, manda­tory face masks, and caps on the num­ber of peo­ple at­tend­ing large events. But these cau­tions have largely been ig­nored.</p>
    <p>“I’m tired of so­cial dis­tanc­ing for eight months. I was good dur­ing all the fes­ti­vals till now.</p>
    <p>“Now, enough, I want to play taash (gam­bling with cards) like we do ev­ery Di­wali. We’ll wear masks,” said Mr Deep­ank Ti­wari, a start-up founder in Delhi, who has in­vited 20 rel­a­tives and friends for a party. The fes­ti­val is called Di­wali in north­ern In­dia.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment hopes to dis­tract In­di­ans starved of so­cial min­gling with re­tail ther­apy.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi urged peo­ple to buy In­dian prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>He said: “Cel­e­brat­ing Di­wali with lo­cal prod­ucts will give a new boost to the econ­omy.”</p>
    <p>The In­dian econ­omy is ex­pected to con­tract this year for the first time i n about four decades, as a re­sult of the pan­demic and the months-long lock­down im­posed ear­lier in the year.</p>
    <p>How­ever, cor­po­rate prof­its and the stock mar­ket have re­cov­ered faster than ex­pected. A good mon­soon has raised hopes of a spike in ru­ral con­sumer de­mand.</p>
    <p>Fes­tiv­i­ties have given a boost to the au­to­mo­bile industry that has been on a down­ward spi­ral for nearly a year, with worker lay­offs and un­sold in­ven­tory. Car sales im­proved sig­nif­i­cantly in Oc­to­ber com­pared with last year, ac­cord­ing to the So­ci­ety of In­dian Au­to­mo­bile Man­u­fac­tur­ers. Deep dis­counts, gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies, and the grow­ing pref­er­ence for per­sonal ve­hi­cles over public trans­port dur­ing the pan­demic have helped.</p>
    <p>Gold sales usu­ally shine brighter around Dhanteras, the first day of the fes­ti­val, which is con­sid­ered an aus­pi­cious time by Hindu fam­i­lies to buy gold and sil­ver. But gold buy­ing has so far been nearly 50 per cent lower than last year.</p>
    <p>As shop­pers largely avoid malls and su­per­mar­kets, on­line shop­ping has ex­ploded. E-com­merce giants Ama­zon and Wal­mar­towned Flip­kart, who usu­ally see their big­gest sales in In­dia around the fes­ti­val, earned about US$3.5 bil­lion (S$4.72 bil­lion) in the first four days of their flag­ship sale events last month.</p>
    <p>Mak­ing its de­but this year is JioMart, owned by Mr Mukesh Am­bani, the coun­try’s rich­est man and head of Reliance In­dus­tries. In the past year, it has got bil­lions in fund­ing and tech­no­log­i­cal back­ing from Face­book and Google.</p>
    <p>An­nual bonuses are usu­ally given to em­ploy­ees dur­ing Deep­avali, and some man­u­fac­tur­ers have said they will not cut them. But em­ploy­ers in hard-hit ser­vices, me­dia, real es­tate and hos­pi­tal­ity in­dus­tries have post­poned or can­celled bonuses.</p>
    <p>“We only dis­trib­uted sweets and a small gift bag with house­hold items. I told my guys to man­age till 2021, when we’ll see a bright morn­ing,” said a ce­ment sup­plier to a ma­jor con­struc­tion com­pany.</p>
    <p>The cen­tral gov­ern­ment and some state gov­ern­ments like Ra­jasthan, Ut­tar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Haryana have ap­proved bonuses, hop­ing to stoke con­sumer spend­ing.</p>
