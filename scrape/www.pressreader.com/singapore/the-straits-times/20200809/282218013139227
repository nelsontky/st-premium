    <p>LAU­SANNE • Gianni In­fantino has in­sisted that he had “noth­ing to hide” in a let­ter to mem­ber fed­er­a­tions of foot­ball’s gov­ern­ing body Fifa, de­spite Swiss pros­e­cu­tors launch­ing a crim­i­nal probe against him.</p>
    <p>In the let­ter, sent on Thurs­day and seen by Agence FrancePres­se, the Fifa pres­i­dent told the body’s 211 mem­bers that there were no “fac­tual grounds for the open­ing of a crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion” an­nounced last week.</p>
    <p>The spe­cial pros­e­cu­tor has been in­ves­ti­gat­ing sus­pected col­lu­sion be­tween In­fantino and Swiss At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Michael Lauber, who re­signed last month over his han­dling of a cor­rup­tion in­ves­ti­ga­tion tar­get­ing Fifa.</p>
    <p>In­fantino and Lauber are said to have held se­cret meet­ings in 2016 and 2017, but the Fifa chief said the meet­ings were about restor­ing “pub­lic trust in our in­sti­tu­tion” af­ter a series of scan­dals.</p>
    <p>He claims those meet­ings “were in no way se­cret and most cer­tainly not il­le­gal”.</p>
    <p>“I went to these meet­ings with the most se­nior law of­fi­cer in the coun­try in or­der to of­fer our full sup­port and as­sis­tance in con­nec­tion with the on­go­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tions, be­cause Fifa has an in­ter­est and is a dam­aged party in these in­ves­ti­ga­tions,” In­fantino wrote.</p>
    <p>Last Sun­day, Fifa in­sisted In­fantino would con­tinue to ful­fil his du­ties as pres­i­dent and blasted the Swiss probe, while its former head Sepp Blat­ter called for his suc­ces­sor to be sus­pended.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to AFP, In­fantino’s lawyer David Zollinger said that since the an­nounce­ment of the in­ves­ti­ga­tion, his client has not re­ceived “any in­for­ma­tion” from the pros­e­cu­tor and “has not been sum­moned” to any hear­ings.</p>
    <p>A former pros­e­cu­tor, Zollinger was a mem­ber of the su­per­vi­sory au­thor­ity of the Swiss pub­lic pros­e­cu­tor’s of­fice – which over­saw Lauber – be­tween 2011 and 2016.</p>
    <p>He de­nies any con­flict of in­ter­est, say­ing that his last meet­ings at the su­per­vi­sory au­thor­ity “took place in June and July of 2016 and at that time no one was aware of the meet­ings be­tween Lauber and In­fantino”.</p>
