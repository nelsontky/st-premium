    <p>JAKARTA • In­done­sia’s cap­i­tal city Jakarta, the coun­try’s first epi­cen­tre of the Covid-19 out­break, is mulling over whether to reim­pose re­stric­tions it pre­vi­ously eased as the daily num­ber of new cases hit record highs.</p>
    <p>Jakarta re­ported 281 new cases on Mon­day, mak­ing it a to­tal of 14,797 cases in the city so far, with 697 deaths. Mon­day’s fig­ure was the fifth largest af­ter 404 on Sun­day, 378 on Satur­day, 357 last Wed­nes­day and 284 last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>As of yes­ter­day, the na­tion­wide case tally was 78,572, with 3,710 deaths.</p>
    <p>The lat­est data came a day af­ter Jakarta Gov­er­nor Anies Baswedan said the city might con­sider tight­en­ing its large-scale so­cial re­stric­tions, lo­cally known as PSBB.</p>
    <p>Jakarta has grad­u­ally re­laxed re­stric­tions since June 4 to re­vive the econ­omy, with busi­nesses and of­fices re­open­ing un­der new health pro­to­cols. It has also re­opened pub­lic green spa­ces and out­door tourist des­ti­na­tions.</p>
    <p>“If this con­tin­ues, we may have to re­turn to (so­cial re­stric­tions)… do not let this sit­u­a­tion reach the point where we have to pull the emer­gency brake,” Mr Anies said on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The tighter re­stric­tions would see a restora­tion of stricter PSBB, which had al­lowed only eight es­sen­tial sec­tors to op­er­ate dur­ing the pan­demic. “If that hap­pens, we all have to go back home, and eco­nomic, re­li­gious and so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties will be halted,” Mr Anies said.</p>
    <p>He added that while most of the new cases were the re­sult of mas­sive “ac­tive case find­ing” ef­forts, the city’s rate of pos­i­tive cases – the num­ber of peo­ple who test pos­i­tive di­vided by the to­tal num­ber tested – has caused con­cern.</p>
    <p>Jakarta’s weekly pos­i­tiv­ity rate had con­sis­tently been be­low 5 per cent since the start of last month, in line with one of the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s re­quire­ments for re­gions seek­ing to en­ter the so-called “new nor­mal”.</p>
    <p>But the rate on Satur­day was recorded at 7.1 per cent and it was 9.6 per cent on Sun­day, with a weekly av­er­age of 5.7 per cent last week.</p>
    <p>“That is why I want to tell all Jakar­tans: Do not take this lightly. Do not feel like we are free of the Covid-19 out­break,” Mr Anies said.</p>
    <p>With the out­break show­ing no signs of abat­ing, he warned the pub­lic to main­tain their daily rou­tines while ex­er­cis­ing ex­tra cau­tion in vul­ner­a­ble hot spots: pub­lic tran­sit and wet mar­kets.</p>
