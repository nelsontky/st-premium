    <p>Con­ser­va­tion ex­perts are be­com­ing in­creas­ingly con­cerned with sur­gi­cal mask lit­ter all over the is­land.</p>
    <p>Clean-up groups here have been pick­ing up an av­er­age of four to five sur­gi­cal masks dur­ing each clear­ing foray at lo­cal parks, beaches and neigh­bour­hoods.</p>
    <p>Mr Eugene Heng, founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of Wa­ter­ways Watch So­ci­ety, said that it has seen a three­fold in­crease in mask lit­ter in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­i­sa­tion con­ducts an av­er­age of two to three coastal and wa­ter­way clean-ups each week, usu­ally cov­er­ing Jurong Lake­side Park, Kal­lang River­side Park and Pung­gol Wa­ter­way Park.</p>
    <p>In the third week of Novem­ber alone, a to­tal of 19 masks were picked up in the Kal­lang and Ma­rina Bay ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng Li Seng, founder of so­cial en­ter­prise Green Nudge, noted that there was more mask lit­ter in parks, prob­a­bly due to masks been dis­posed of and blown by the wind into nearby bushes.</p>
    <p>“I’m afraid with the pan­demic, masks may be­come one of the many types of lit­ter that we will come to see in the fore­see­able fu­ture, like cig­a­rette butts or tis­sue pa­per... Masks could be­come an­other source of plas­tic pol­lu­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Zero Waste SG ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Pek Hai Lin told The Straits Times that mask lit­ter can­not be viewed “as an is­sue in silo”.</p>
    <p>She iden­ti­fied the lack of en­vi­ron­men­tal own­er­ship in Sin­ga­pore as a con­tribut­ing fac­tor, with peo­ple be­ing “de­tached from the con­se­quences of their ac­tions to the en­vi­ron­ment”.</p>
    <p>She noted that this could be a re­sult of re­ly­ing on oth­ers to clean up af­ter the res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>To help raise aware­ness, the Public Hy­giene Council en­cour­ages peo­ple to take part in small-scale lit­ter­pick­ing ac­tiv­i­ties “to ex­pe­ri­ence how... dis­pos­able masks and take­away pack­ag­ing are adding to the ever-grow­ing pile of plas­tic waste”.</p>
    <p>But the Covid-19 pan­demic has also in­creased the amount of med­i­cal waste pro­duced since last year.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency, bio­haz­ardous waste from med­i­cal in­sti­tu­tions, such as per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment con­tam­i­nated with bod­ily flu­ids in­clud­ing blood, should be in­cin­er­ated.</p>
    <p>Be­tween March and Septem­ber, an av­er­age of 16 tonnes of bio­haz­ardous waste was col­lected each day, 54 per cent higher com­pared with the daily av­er­age in 2019.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Suresh Valiyaveet­til from the depart­ment of chem­istry at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore said that an in­creased vol­ume of waste could push in­cin­er­a­tors to their lim­its. The flue gas clean­ing sys­tem would have to work more ef­fi­ciently to cap­ture all dust, pol­lu­tant chem­i­cals and toxic gases.</p>
    <p>He added that putting plas­tic in a land­fill is never a per­ma­nent so­lu­tion, as plas­tic de­grades slowly in the nat­u­ral en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>While the pro­duc­tion of bio­haz­ardous waste may be “un­avoid­able”, Prof Valiyaveet­til said that peo­ple can still play their part in re­duc­ing plas­tic waste by swop­ping to re­us­able masks when­ever pos­si­ble.</p>
