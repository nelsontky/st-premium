    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion in the United States used the In­ter­na­tional Emer­gency Eco­nomic Pow­ers Act to is­sue or­ders last Thurs­day that ef­fec­tively ban US trans­ac­tions with the Chi­ne­se­owned so­cial me­dia apps TikTok and WeChat. This widely ex­pected de­ci­sion comes af­ter Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo un­veiled a sweep­ing Clean Net­work ini­tia­tive on data se­cu­rity and ci­ti­zens’ pri­vacy which calls for app stores like those run by Ap­ple to bar “un­trusted” Chi­nese apps and prod­ucts, and which also seeks to pre­vent US data be­ing stored by Chi­nese cloud-com­put­ing com­pa­nies. Other coun­tries are be­ing urged to sim­i­larly de­cou­ple from Chi­nese in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy prod­ucts and come “clean”, so to speak.</p>
    <p>Next, ex­pect re­stric­tions on US-listed Chi­nese firms which are be­ing com­pelled to fol­low US au­dit­ing rules or delist from US stock ex­changes by 2022. The weight of pres­sure on Bei­jing is not re­stricted to the tech­nol­ogy sec­tor or ac­cess to cap­i­tal, but also en­com­passes the po­lit­i­cal sphere. Last Fri­day, the US an­nounced sanc­tions on Hong Kong Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam and 10 other Chi­nese of­fi­cials. On Sun­day, Health Sec­re­tary Alex Azar ar­rived in Tai­wan for the high­est-level visit by a US Cab­i­net of­fi­cial in four decades. What is com­ing into view ap­pears to be noth­ing short of a tar­geted at­tempt to axe a mul­ti­fac­eted re­la­tion­ship cau­tiously built up over close to five decades, and re­place it with a durable an­i­mos­ity.</p>
    <p>China has called the moves against its tech­nol­ogy firms a “naked, hege­monic act” and strong com­ments have also come from For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi. More em­blem­atic of the se­ri­ous­ness of the de­vel­op­ing sit­u­a­tion, how­ever, is the 90-minute call be­tween the Chi­nese de­fence min­is­ter and his US coun­ter­part. How­ever, any hopes that this ef­fort to use the most sta­ble as­pect of the bi­lat­eral re­la­tion­ship – mil­i­tary to mil­i­tary ties – to ease the sit­u­a­tion have been dashed by the US De­fence Depart­ment’s me­dia brief­ing, which in­di­cated the Pen­tagon was stick­ing to a hard line dur­ing the lengthy call. This dims hopes of a swift im­prove­ment in ten­sions once the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion is out of the way.</p>
    <p>It is tempt­ing to blame all this on an un­so­phis­ti­cated and bel­liger­ent US leader. But Bei­jing needs to pon­der its own role. Firms such as WeChat and Alibaba owe much of their dom­i­nance to Bei­jing ring-fenc­ing the do­mes­tic mar­ket from outsiders. China also ini­ti­ated the walling off of its In­ter­net a decade ago. That said, China is Ap­ple’s sec­ond largest mar­ket af­ter the US, and Gen­eral Mo­tors sells more cars there than at home. Be­sides, TikTok, founded by a Chi­nese en­gi­neer who once worked with Mi­crosoft, surely is not quite the same as Huawei, founded by a former Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army of­fi­cer. It is a sit­u­a­tion that calls for open palm ne­go­ti­a­tions but un­for­tu­nately, they’d be likely only af­ter the Nov 3 elec­tion.</p>
