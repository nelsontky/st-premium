    <p>The prop­erty mar­ket con­tin­ues to draw in­ter­est amid the pan­demic, with over 90 per cent of the 120 units re­leased for The Land­mark con­do­minium snapped up on its launch week­end.</p>
    <p>About 110 units were sold as at yes­ter­day, rep­re­sent­ing some 30 per cent of the to­tal num­ber of units at the 99-year l ease­hold project in Chin Swee Road.</p>
    <p>The units went for an av­er­age price of $2,250 per square foot (psf). About half of them are onebed­ders with a start­ing price of $1,955 psf.</p>
    <p>Most of the buy­ers are Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens and per­ma­nent res­i­dents, said de­vel­oper Land­mark JV yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Lo­cated on the north­ern foothills of Pearl’s Hill, The Land­mark com­prises a sin­gle 39-storey tower of 396 one- to three-bed­room units with five decks of life­style fa­cil­i­ties as well as views of the city sky­line and southern coast­line. It is ex­pected to ob­tain the tem­po­rary oc­cu­pa­tion per­mit in March 2025.</p>
    <p>Land­mark JV is a joint ven­ture be­tween MCC Land, SSLE De­vel­op­ment and ZACD Group. The part­ners bought the site through a col­lec­tive sale of the for­mer Land­mark Tower in May 2018 for some $286 mil­lion, or $1,406 psf per plot ra­tio. This in­cludes a lease up­grad­ing pre­mium of $57 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>They also had to buy some ad­join­ing state land, re­ported The Busi­ness Times.</p>
    <p>In the light of the Covid-19 pan­demic, sales book­ings were done vir­tu­ally from five lo­ca­tions, such as the project’s sales gallery as well as the of­fices of mar­ket­ing agen­cies ERA Sin­ga­pore, Hut­tons Asia, PropNex and SLP In­ter­na­tional.</p>
    <p>Mr Ken Chew, gen­eral man­ager of SSLE De­vel­op­ment, said: “The pos­i­tive re­sponse from home buy­ers on the launch day bears tes­ti­mony to our com­mit­ment to price the project to sell.</p>
    <p>“We hope that a higher live-in pop­u­la­tion within and around the Cen­tral Busi­ness Dis­trict will add more vi­brancy to this neigh­bour­hood.”</p>
