    <p>In­done­sia must en­sure a rad­i­cal cleric and sus­pected mas­ter­mind of the 2002 Bali bomb­ings does not in­cite more vi­o­lence when he is re­leased from jail this week, Aus­tralian Min­is­ter for For­eign Af­fairs Marise Payne said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Abu Bakar Bashir was jailed in 2011 for links to mil­i­tant train­ing camps in the In­done­sian prov­ince of Aceh.</p>
    <p>He is con­sid­ered the spir­i­tual leader of the Al-Qaeda-linked Je­maah Is­lamiah (JI) net­work, which was ac­cused of or­ches­trat­ing the bomb­ings of night­clubs on the hol­i­day is­land of Bali.</p>
    <p>Ms Payne said in a state­ment: “Our em­bassy in Jakarta has made clear our con­cerns that such in­di­vid­u­als be pre­vented from fur­ther in­cit­ing others to carry out fu­ture at­tacks against in­no­cent civil­ians.”</p>
    <p>Bashir, 82, de­nied any in­volve­ment in the Bali bomb­ings. A lawyer for Bashir did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment on his re­lease, due on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The Bali bomb­ings killed more than 200 peo­ple, among them scores of Aus­tralians. JI op­er­a­tives were also ac­cused of or­gan­is­ing an at­tack on the JW Mar­riott ho­tel in Jakarta that killed 12 peo­ple in 2003.</p>
    <p>A se­nior JI op­er­a­tive was be­lieved to have made bombs for both at­tacks.</p>
    <p>Ms Payne said Aus­tralia has told In­done­sia to en­sure he is no longer a dan­ger to others.</p>
