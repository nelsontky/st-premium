    <p>If you are go­ing to re­boot a fran­chise, Co­bra Kai is a text­book ex­am­ple of how to do it right.</p>
    <p>A spin-off of The Karate Kid movies (1984 to 1994), it is the se­quel no one re­ally needed – es­pe­cially not hard­core fans of the fran­chise, which was about Cal­i­for­nia teenager Danny LaRusso (Ralph Mac­chio) and his life-chang­ing karate teacher, Mr Miyagi.</p>
    <p>Fans were trau­ma­tised enough by the dread­ful fourth film in the series, The Next Karate Kid, where Miyagi coaches a girl played by Hi­lary Swank.</p>
    <p>But rather than sim­ply recre­ate the movies’ great­est hits, the series – a deft blend of un­der­dog comedy, teen ro­mance and sen­ti­men­tal drama – at­tacks it from the point of view of one of the orig­i­nal vil­lains, Danny’s karate neme­sis Johnny Lawrence (Wil­liam Zabka).</p>
    <p>Mac­chio and Zabka reprise their roles for the show, which be­gins three decades af­ter Danny beat Johnny in a fate­ful karate tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>Now, Johnny is a job­less drunk with anger is­sues. And he lives in the shadow of his old ri­val, now an an­noy­ingly suc­cess­ful car dealer.</p>
    <p>But as cur­mud­geonly as Johnny is, the show sug­gests a re­vi­sion­ist his­tory of their hero-vil­lain re­la­tion­ship. Maybe Danny wasn’t re­ally the good guy when they were kids. Af­ter all, he stole Johnny’s girl, and was the crane kick he won the tour­na­ment with even a le­gal move?</p>
    <p>In flash­backs, we see that Johnny’s life back then was not all peaches and cream. And slowly, the story nudges him and Danny to­wards a de­tente.</p>
    <p>An­other rea­son this re­make works is it brings in a new gen­er­a­tion of karate kids for younger view­ers.</p>
    <p>There is Johnny’s neigh­bour Miguel (Xolo Mariduena), whom he teaches to de­fend him­self from bul­lies; Johnny’s es­tranged son, Robby (Tan­ner Buchanan), who ends up be­ing men­tored by Danny; and Sam (Mary Mouser), Danny’s daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>The plot and hu­mour will be fa­mil­iar to any­one who watches Amer­i­can teen come­dies.</p>
    <p>But Co­bra Kai ex­e­cutes all the tropes per­fectly and is es­pe­cially hi­lar­i­ous when con­trast­ing Johnny’s po­lit­i­cal in­cor­rect­ness with the in­suf­fer­able wo­ke­ness of some teenagers to­day.</p>
    <p>You may barely re­mem­ber The Karate Kid films or per­haps never saw them at all, but 1980s nos­tal­gia – from the aes­thetic to the syn­the­sizer sound­track – is still so trendy, it gives the show a bit of a retro edge.</p>
    <p>And you do not have to be fond of karate bat­tles to binge your way through this thor­oughly en­joy­able first sea­son.</p>
    <p>Con­tin­u­ing with the theme of friend­ship and ri­valry is an­other new gem on Net­flix, The Speed</p>
    <p>Cu­bers.</p>
    <p>It is a doc­u­men­tary set in a world most peo­ple do not even know ex­ists – com­pet­i­tive</p>
    <p>“speed­cub­ing”, or solv­ing Ru­bik’s cubes of dif­fer­ent shapes and sizes as quickly as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>It fol­lows two young men who have dom­i­nated the sport in the last few years: 17-year-old Max Park from the United States and 23-year old Fe­liks Zemdegs from Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Your first re­ac­tion might be: Who even watches these tour­na­ments? And the film does not re­ally make a con­vinc­ing case for the mer­its of this as a main­stream spec­ta­tor sport.</p>
    <p>But it does have a statis­tics pro­fes­sor break down the ar­cane skills of be­ing a speed­cu­ber, which in­volves as­ton­ish­ing feats of pat­tern recog­ni­tion and mus­cle mem­ory, and prac­tis­ing hours a day to learn hun­dreds of al­go­rithms and move se­quences.</p>
    <p>As with any highly com­pet­i­tive pur­suit, there is also in­tense ri­valry.</p>
    <p>Fe­liks has watched the string of world records he has set in var­i­ous speed­cub­ing events fall, one by one, to Max, un­til the one he holds for the 3x3 cube is all that is left.</p>
    <p>But we then learn that Max is autis­tic and, emo­tion­ally, the same age as a nine-year-old.</p>
    <p>Speed­cub­ing was a break­through for him de­vel­op­men­tally – the only way he learned to en­gage with oth­ers, in­clud­ing his par­ents, who none­the­less fret over how los­ing will af­fect him.</p>
    <p>Yet de­spite their ri­valry, Fe­liks and he are cut from the same cloth;</p>
    <p>Max idolises him and Fe­liks, in turn, has the most ten­der, fra­ter­nal con­cern for the younger boy, even as he de­mol­ishes each of his world records.</p>
    <p>Things come to a head at the world cham­pi­onships in Syd­ney in 2019, where Max is favoured to win the 3x3 event and Fe­liks looks like the age­ing champ on his way out.</p>
    <p>None of it will make you want to go out and watch a speed­cub­ing event but, by the time it is over, you will have found your­self hold­ing your breath for the few sec­onds it takes these Usain Bolts to do their thing.</p>
    <p>As sports doc­u­men­taries go, it does not get any sweeter or more whole­some than this.</p>
