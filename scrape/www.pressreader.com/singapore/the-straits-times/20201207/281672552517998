    <p>SEOUL • South Korea will im­pose height­ened so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules for the cap­i­tal Seoul and sur­round­ing ar­eas, health of­fi­cials said yes­ter­day as the au­thor­i­ties strug­gled to con­tain the na­tion’s largest wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions in nine months.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion comes af­ter the gov­ern­ment im­ple­mented un­prece­dented mea­sures on Satur­day in a coun­try that had seen ini­tial suc­cess through ag­gres­sive con­tact trac­ing and other steps.</p>
    <p>“We are in a very dan­ger­ous sit­u­a­tion,” Health Min­istry of­fi­cial Park Ne­ung-hoo told a brief­ing. He said lo­calised clus­ters have the po­ten­tial to be­come a na­tional out­break.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Chung Sye-kyun said yes­ter­day that the so­cial dis­tanc­ing alert level for the greater Seoul area will be raised to 2.5 from two, re­ported Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>“The sit­u­a­tion in the greater Seoul area is se­ri­ous,” Mr Chung said at a Cen­tral Dis­as­ter and Safety Coun­ter­mea­sures meet­ing in Seoul’s City Hall.</p>
    <p>“The 2.5 level will be main­tained for the next three weeks un­til the end of the year,” said Mr Chung.</p>
    <p>Many of the re­cent cases have been cen­tred in Seoul, which on Satur­day launched un­prece­dented cur­fews, shut­ter­ing most es­tab­lish­ments at 9pm for two weeks and cut­ting back public trans­porta­tion by 30 per cent in the evenings.</p>
    <p>Un­der the mea­sures an­nounced yes­ter­day, which go into ef­fect to­mor­row, gath­er­ings of 50 or more peo­ple are pro­hib­ited, and gyms and karaoke bars must close.</p>
    <p>Re­li­gious ser­vices must be held on­line or by broad­cast, and stricter at­ten­dance lim­its will be placed on school classes, Mr Park said.</p>
    <p>While restau­rants will still be al­lowed to pro­vide in-per­son ser­vice, the gov­ern­ment is urg­ing peo­ple to avoid eat­ing out if pos­si­ble and not to hold non-es­sen­tial so­cial gath­er­ings, he said.</p>
    <p>The curbs will last at least three weeks, un­til the end of the month, Mr Park said.</p>
    <p>The cen­tral gov­ern­ment will dis­cuss whether to add more mea­sures af­ter mon­i­tor­ing the current spread of the virus. A shift to level three would re­sult in a sus­pen­sion on gath­er­ings of more than 10 and all sport­ing events.</p>
    <p>Other ar­eas of the coun­try will also see height­ened re­stric­tions, but at a lower level than the Seoul area.</p>
    <p>The Korea Disease Con­trol and Preven­tion Agency (KDCA) re­ported 631 new cases as at mid­night on Satur­day – the largest daily tally since a peak in Fe­bru­ary and early March – bring­ing the coun­try’s to­tal to 37,546, with 545 deaths.</p>
    <p>Nearly a month of triple-digit daily in­fec­tions has brought the num­ber of ac­tive cases in South Korea to a record 7,873, the KDCA said. It also raised con­cerns over the dwin­dling num­ber of hos­pi­tal beds.</p>
    <p>“Right now it is ex­ceed­ing the level that we can con­trol in our hos­pi­tal sys­tem,” Mr Park said.</p>
    <p>New beds are be­ing added and for now there are enough to treat pa­tients, but if the trend con­tin­ues, the coun­try could face a short­age of beds, he said.</p>
