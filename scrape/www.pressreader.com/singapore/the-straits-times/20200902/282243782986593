    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) • Be­fore the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion sea­son started, ESPN gave the Ok­la­homa City Thun­der a 0.2 per cent chance of mak­ing the play-offs.</p>
    <p>This was sup­posed to be a team in tran­si­tion, hav­ing un­der­gone a ma­jor over­haul of their ros­ter in the off-sea­son.</p>
    <p>They de­fied all odds to reach the post-sea­son, but again, few gave the Thun­der a chance against the Hous­ton Rock­ets in their Western Con­fer­ence first-round se­ries.</p>
    <p>With a team of “re­jects” and led by an age­ing All-Star in Chris Paul, 35, the fifth seeds were quickly dis­missed although their op­po­nents were seeded only a place higher.</p>
    <p>Af­ter scor­ing a team-high 28 points to lead the Thun­der to a 104-100 vic­tory to tie the se­ries at 3-3 on Mon­day, Paul hailed the char­ac­ter of his team­mates.</p>
    <p>“This is who we are,” the guard told broad­caster TNT af­ter­wards at Dis­ney World.</p>
    <p>“We’re built for stuff like this. A lot of guys on our team have been pushed out, traded or what not, but we just stick to­gether and we keep fight­ing, gave our­selves a chance. Game 7, any­thing can hap­pen.”</p>
    <p>Like many of his team­mates, Paul knows how it feels to be un­wanted. A year af­ter lead­ing the Rock­ets to Game 7 of the 2018 West Fi­nals, he was traded to Ok­la­homa City for Rus­sell West­brook and four firstround picks last sum­mer.</p>
    <p>Thun­der for­ward Danilo Gal­li­nari and guard Shai Gil­geous-Alexan­der were the makeweight­s in the block­buster trade deal that took Paul George to the Los An­ge­les Clip­pers.</p>
    <p>Both started against the Rock­ets, with Gal­li­nari in par­tic­u­lar com­ing up big. His 25-point per­for­mance was the se­cond-high­est of the night for the Thun­der and Paul be­lieves they can com­plete the up­set to­day.</p>
    <p>22 Turnovers com­mit­ted by the Rock­ets in Game 6 against Ok­la­homa City. Hous­ton guard James Har­den, who holds the un­wanted record for most turnovers (13 against Golden State in 2015) in a sin­gle play-off game, gave up the ball five times.</p>
    <p>Ok­la­homa City coach Billy Dono­van also feels his team have a chance as long as his star player, who tal­lied 15 points in the fourth quar­ter, in­clud­ing a pair of three­p­oint­ers, con­tin­ues to keep per­form­ing when it mat­ters most.</p>
    <p>“He’s got un­be­liev­able bas­ket­ball IQ,” he said of Paul.</p>
    <p>“He’s in­cred­i­bly smart. He’s a great com­peti­tor. He’s got an in­cred­i­ble will to win.</p>
    <p>“When you have a guy with that kind of mind, ma­nip­u­lat­ing and sur­vey­ing the court the way he does, he did an in­cred­i­ble job... He was spec­tac­u­lar.”</p>
    <p>All-Star James Har­den led all scor­ers with 32 points, but Hous­ton were again let down by sloppy play, end­ing with 22 turnovers of which five were of his do­ing.</p>
    <p>An­other seven were made by West­brook, but the Rock­ets re­main con­vinced they can seal a semi-fi­nal match-up with the top seeds Los An­ge­les Lak­ers as long they can cut out the er­rors.</p>
    <p>Har­den said: “We’ve both got to be bet­ter with the bas­ket­ball. Twelve turnovers be­tween the two. If we cut those in half, we give our­selves a bet­ter shot.”</p>
