    <p>The big­gest party in Malaysia’s Perikatan Na­sional (PN) rul­ing coali­tion – Umno – yes­ter­day called for a po­lit­i­cal cease­fire, about a week af­ter it threat­ened to with­draw its sup­port for Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin, as the coun­try wres­tles with a ris­ing num­ber of coron­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>Umno pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi said the party would now fully back Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s gov­ern­ment to over­come the eco­nomic chal­lenges aris­ing from the par­tial lock­downs im­posed on onethird of the coun­try due to a new surge in Covid-19 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The state­ment by Zahid is likely to put a dent in op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim’s bid to be­come prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri An­war had claimed a par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity early last week, pur­port­edly with the back­ing of Zahid and sev­eral other Umno lead­ers.</p>
    <p>But the lat­est Umno U-turn to again back the PN gov­ern­ment means that Mr An­war may no longer re­ceive the sup­port he needs to claim the pre­mier­ship, out­lin­ing Malaysia’s fluid po­lit­i­cal sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war has, to date, re­fused to divulge the list of par­lia­men­tar­i­ans who are back­ing his bid for the pre­mier­ship.</p>
    <p>Both the Royal Palace and the po­lice have said the Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat (PKR) pres­i­dent has not re­vealed the names of his back­ers.</p>
    <p>Zahid said in a state­ment: “The party has or­dered all of the party’s lead­ers who are in the Cabi­net to give their full fo­cus to help the peo­ple and re­duce the bur­den that they suf­fer due to the i mpact of Covid-19.” He also called for a “strength­en­ing” of ties in the PN coali­tion to com­bat the im­pact of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Umno had, on Oct 13, said it would con­sider pulling out of PN, should its “fresh de­mands” not be met. These de­mands re­port­edly in­cluded a Cabi­net reshuf­fle to ap­pease the party’s top lead­ers, in­clud­ing se­cur­ing the deputy prime min­is­ter’s post.</p>
    <p>The de­mands re­flected in­creas­ing ten­sions be­tween Umno – which is PN’s big­gest party with 39 MPs – and Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din’s Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia. While Ber­satu has 31 MPs, it has 11 Cabi­net posts com­pared to Umno’s nine.</p>
    <p>Ten­sions deep­ened af­ter t he Sabah elec­tion on Sept 26 when a Ber­satu leader was ap­pointed chief min­is­ter of the state in­stead of an Umno chief­tain.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing Mr An­war’s Oct 13 au­di­ence with Malaysia’s King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah, to claim par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity, the palace said the king had post­poned in­ter­view­ing party lead­ers to ver­ify the claim un­til the par­tial lock­down to curb the coron­avirus spread is lifted.</p>
    <p>The fed­eral ter­ri­to­ries of Kuala Lumpur, Pu­tra­jaya and Labuan, along with Se­lan­gor and Sabah states – which to­gether house about 30 per cent of the coun­try’s 32 million peo­ple – have been placed un­der a con­di­tional move­ment con­trol or­der (CMCO).</p>
    <p>The 14-day CMCO for Kuala Lumpur, Pu­tra­jaya and Se­lan­gor is sched­uled to be lifted next Tues­day, un­less the gov­ern­ment de­cides to ex­tend it.</p>
    <p>Malaysia has re­ported more than 800 daily coron­avirus cases in the past four days, reach­ing an all-time high of 871 cases on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>It re­ported 732 cases yes­ter­day. Se­lan­gor – the state that sur­rounds fed­eral cap­i­tal Kuala Lumpur – had the sec­ond high­est num­ber of daily cases, at 114, af­ter Sabah’s 535.</p>
    <p>Umno had, on Oct 13, said it would con­sider pulling out of PN, should its “fresh de­mands” not be met. These de­mands re­port­edly in­cluded a Cabi­net reshuf­fle to ap­pease the party’s top lead­ers... The de­mands re­flected in­creas­ing ten­sions be­tween Umno – which is PN’s big­gest party with 39 MPs – and Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din’s Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia.</p>
