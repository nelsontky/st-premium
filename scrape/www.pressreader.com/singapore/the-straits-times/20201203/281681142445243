    <p>WASHINGTON • Mr Rudy Gi­u­liani, US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s per­sonal lawyer who has led the most ex­ten­sive ef­forts to dam­age his client’s po­lit­i­cal ri­vals and un­der­mine the elec­tion re­sults, dis­cussed with him as re­cently as last week the pos­si­bil­ity of re­ceiv­ing a pre-emp­tive par­don be­fore Mr Trump leaves of­fice, ac­cord­ing to two peo­ple told of the dis­cus­sion.</p>
    <p>It was not clear who raised the topic.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has not in­di­cated what he will do, one of the peo­ple said.</p>
    <p>Mr Gi­u­liani’s po­ten­tial crim­i­nal ex­po­sure is un­clear. He was un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion as re­cently as this sum­mer by fed­eral pros­e­cu­tors in Man­hat­tan for his busi­ness deal­ings in Ukraine and his role in oust­ing t he Amer­i­can am­bas­sador there, a plot that was at the heart of the im­peach­ment of Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>Mr Gi­u­liani did not re­spond to a mes­sage seek­ing com­ment, but af­ter a ver­sion of this ar­ti­cle was pub­lished on­line, he at­tacked it on Twit­ter and said it was false.</p>
    <p>Mr Gi­u­liani’s lawyer, Mr Robert Costello, said: “He’s not con­cerned about this in­ves­ti­ga­tion be­cause he didn’t do any­thing wrong, and that’s been our po­si­tion from day one.”</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Mr Trump did not re­spond to an e-mail seek­ing com­ment.</p>
    <p>Such a broad par­don pre-empt­ing any charge or con­vic­tion is highly un­usual but does have prece­dent. In the most fa­mous ex­am­ple, pres­i­dent Ger­ald Ford par­doned Richard Nixon for all of his ac­tions as pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has wielded his clemency pow­ers lib­er­ally in cases that res­onate with him per­son­ally or for peo­ple who have a di­rect line to him through friends or fam­ily, while thou­sands of other cases await his re­view.</p>
    <p>A par­don for Mr Gi­u­liani, who has been in­volved in some of the Pres­i­dent’s most brazen acts, is cer­tain to prompt ac­cu­sa­tions that Mr Trump has used his par­don power to ob­struct in­ves­ti­ga­tions and in­su­late him­self and his al­lies.</p>
    <p>Mr An­drew Weiss­mann, a top pros­e­cu­tor for spe­cial coun­sel Robert Mueller, has said that Mr Trump’s dan­gling of par­dons for his al­lies im­peded their work.</p>
    <p>In July, Mr Trump com­muted the sen­tence of his long­time ad­viser Roger Stone, who had re­fused to co­op­er­ate with the spe­cial coun­sel’s in­ves­ti­ga­tors and was even­tu­ally con­victed of seven felonies.</p>
    <p>Last week, Mr Trump par­doned his for­mer na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser Michael Flynn, who had backed out of his co­op­er­a­tion agree­ment with</p>
    <p>the spe­cial coun­sel’s of­fice for “any and all pos­si­ble of­fences” be­yond the charge he had faced of ly­ing to fed­eral in­ves­ti­ga­tors.</p>
    <p>The Flynn par­don raised ex­pec­ta­tions that Mr Trump would be­stow clemency on other as­so­ci­ates.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent’s dis­cus­sions of a par­don for Mr Gi­u­liani oc­curred as he has served as one of the loud­est voices pub­licly push­ing base­less claims of wide­spread elec­tion fraud that cost Mr Trump the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Gi­u­liani has ex­pressed con­cern that any fed­eral in­ves­ti­ga­tions of his con­duct that ap­pear to have been dor­mant un­der the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion could be re­vived in a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple who have spo­ken to him.</p>
    <p>Le­gal ex­perts say that if Mr Trump wants to fully pro­tect Mr Gi­u­liani from pros­e­cu­tion af­ter he leaves of­fice, the Pres­i­dent would most likely have to de­tail what crimes he be­lieved Mr Gi­u­liani had com­mit­ted in the lan­guage of the par­don.</p>
    <p>Fed­eral pros­e­cu­tors in Man­hat­tan have been in­ves­ti­gat­ing since last year the role of Mr Gi­u­liani and two other as­so­ci­ates in a widerang­ing pres­sure campaign di­rected at push­ing the Ukrainian gov­ern­ment to in­ves­ti­gate Mr Trump’s ri­vals, par­tic­u­larly the son of Mr Joe Bi­den. The two Gi­u­liani as­so­ci­ates – Lev Par­nas and Igor Fru­man – were ar­rested in Oc­to­ber last year as they pre­pared to board a flight from Washington to Frank­furt with one-way tick­ets.</p>
    <p>Par­nas and Fru­man were charged with vi­o­lat­ing campaign fi­nance laws as part of a com­plex scheme to un­der­mine the for­mer Amer­i­can am­bas­sador in Kiev, Ms Marie L. Yo­vanovitch, whom Mr Gi­u­liani and Mr Trump be­lieved should have been do­ing more to pres­sure the Ukraini­ans.</p>
    <p>Pros­e­cu­tors in Man­hat­tan con­tin­ued to in­ves­ti­gate Mr Gi­u­liani’s role in the scheme over the past year, fo­cus­ing on whether he was, in push­ing to oust the US am­bas­sador, es­sen­tially dou­ble dipping: work­ing not only for Mr Trump but also for Ukrainian of­fi­cials who wanted the en­voy gone for their own rea­sons, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple briefed on the mat­ter.</p>
