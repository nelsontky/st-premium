    <p>BEL­GRADE • Scot­land man­ager Steve Clarke was over­joyed to give the Scot­tish peo­ple some­thing to cheer about dur­ing “a dif­fi­cult time for the na­tion” amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, af­ter they beat Ser­bia on Thurs­day to reach Euro 2020.</p>
    <p>The Scots ground out a 5-4 penalty shoot-out win at the Red Star Sta­dium with the play-off game end­ing 1-1 af­ter ex­tra time. It will be their first Euro­pean Cham­pi­onship fi­nals since 1996.</p>
    <p>It is also the first time they have qual­i­fied for a ma­jor tour­na­ment since the 1998 World Cup.</p>
    <p>Clarke’s men will join Eng­land, the Czech Repub­lic and Croa­tia in Group D of the 24-na­tion tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>“It’s a very dif­fi­cult time for Scot­land be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and we spoke be­fore the game about the chance to put a smile on their faces,” Clarke told a news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“We know what we have achieved. Un­be­liev­able, the char­ac­ter the play­ers have shown. It would have been easy to crum­ble af­ter con­ced­ing in the last minute of reg­u­lar time from set play, but we dug in. We’ve been build­ing to­wards this mo­ment and tonight the play­ers and the na­tion can be proud of them­selves.”</p>
    <p>Ryan Christie gave Scot­land a 52nd-minute lead and the vis­i­tors missed sev­eral chances, be­fore Ser­bia sub­sti­tute Luka Jovic headed the equaliser in the dy­ing sec­onds of reg­u­lar time.</p>
    <p>Both sides wasted chances in ex­tra time, be­fore Scot­land goal­keeper David Mar­shall saved Ser­bia’s fi­nal penalty in the shoot-out from Alek­san­dar Mitro­vic to send his side through.</p>
    <p>Mar­shall re­vealed the of­fi­cials had told him to put his cel­e­bra­tions on hold as there was a VAR check for en­croach­ment when Mitro­vic took the penalty.</p>
    <p>“Im­me­di­ately af­ter the save the ref­eree said ‘don’t cel­e­brate yet be­cause there is a VAR check’,” he said. “All you can do is pray be­cause the lads were al­ready cel­e­brat­ing. We de­served the win and we are de­lighted for all the fans and our fam­i­lies who couldn’t be here.”</p>
    <p>An emo­tional Christie said qual­i­fy­ing for the team’s first Euro since 1996 was a “mon­key off the back”.</p>
    <p>“I hope ev­ery­one back home is hav­ing a party tonight. We’ve been through it so many years,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We know it, you know it, ev­ery­one knows it and it’s a mon­key off the back now. It’s just for ev­ery­thing... for the whole na­tion, it’s been a hor­ri­ble year for ev­ery­one and we knew we could give a lit­tle some­thing to this coun­try.”</p>
    <p>Eng­land man­ager Gareth South­gate, who played in the team that faced Scot­land in Euro 96, is rel­ish­ing their meet­ing next year.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing af­ter Eng­land’s 3-0 friendly win over Ire­land on Thurs­day, South­gate said: “It will hope­fully be a fan­tas­tic oc­ca­sion with fans, but that’s the one thing that none of us can con­trol.</p>
    <p>“I’m par­tic­u­larly pleased for Steve. He’s a great guy and has done a great job. That will be a humdinger of a game.</p>
    <p>“They’ve got a team that’s im­prov­ing quickly with a lot of play­ers who have emerged in the last two or three years – the likes of John McGinn, Scott McTominay, Kieran Tierney, An­drew Robert­son.”</p>
