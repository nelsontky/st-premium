    <p>LON­DON • Manch­ester United man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer stopped short of say­ing his side were Premier League ti­tle con­tenders, af­ter a hard-fought 2-1 home win over As­ton Villa on Fri­day put them level on 33 points with lead­ers Liver­pool.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool visit Southamp­ton to­mor­row and United travel to Burn­ley on Jan 12 be­fore a mouth-wa­ter­ing clash at An­field five days later, al­beit in front of empty ter­races due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Red Devils look ca­pa­ble of mount­ing their first real Premier League ti­tle chal­lenge since 2013, when they won their record-ex­tend­ing 20th crown in Alex Fer­gu­son’s last sea­son in charge, but Sol­sk­jaer re­fused to get car­ried away.</p>
    <p>“Of course we are happy with what we are do­ing,” he told the BBC.</p>
    <p>“We have shown we have improved a lot in a year. We are get­ting fit­ter and fit­ter and stronger and stronger.</p>
    <p>“These play­ers are hun­gry to learn, which is im­por­tant. They come in ev­ery day with a hunger and de­sire to be the best on match day. They have been fo­cused.”</p>
    <p>A year ago, United lost 2-0 at Arse­nal to fall 24 points be­hind even­tual cham­pi­ons Liver­pool, hav­ing played two games more.</p>
    <p>Another sea­son fight­ing just for a top-four fin­ish looked in store for Sol­sk­jaer’s men af­ter win­ning only two of their open­ing six league games.</p>
    <p>But, as all the other con­tenders have stum­bled in re­cent weeks, they have now taken 26 from a pos­si­ble 30 points and are 10 games un­beaten in the league.</p>
    <p>Sol­sk­jaer, how­ever, also crit­i­cised his team for try­ing too many au­da­cious passes in­stead of sim­ple ones against a Villa side who came close to snatch­ing a draw.</p>
    <p>“It was maybe a lit­tle too open and we wasted chances. We tried to play the Hol­ly­wood pass in­stead of se­cur­ing the first one and us­ing the space that was there,” he said.</p>
    <p>“You are al­ways de­lighted with three points. We had a good save at the end and Eric Bailly made a fan­tas­tic block so that prob­a­bly saved two points for us.”</p>
    <p>Bruno Fer­nan­des has been the key fig­ure in trans­form­ing United’s for­tunes over the past 12 months and the Por­tuguese again pro­vided the win­ner.</p>
    <p>United needed a 93rd-minute win­ner to beat Wolves 1-0 last Tues­day, but were far faster out the blocks this time round.</p>
    <p>An­thony Mar­tial forced Emil­iano Martinez into an ex­cel­lent save in­side 10 min­utes be­fore Fred, Paul Pogba and Fer­nan­des all fired ef­forts just off tar­get.</p>
    <p>The break­through came five min­utes be­fore the break and owed much to Pogba’s in­ge­nu­ity, with the French­man fi­nally start­ing to find form de­spite the spec­u­la­tion over his fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Pogba and Mar­cus Rash­ford com­bined to send Aaron Wan-Bis­saka free down the right and his cross was headed home by Mar­tial.</p>
    <p>Villa were on a five-game un­beaten run them­selves and showed why with their start to the sec­ond­half as United were forced back.</p>
    <p>Jack Gre­al­ish was again at the heart of all the vis­i­tors’ best work and it was from his cross that Ber­trand Traore equalised.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Dean Smith’s men quickly un­did their good work as a soft chal­lenge from Dou­glas Luiz on Pogba was deemed enough for a penalty by ref­eree Michael Oliver.</p>
    <p>Fer­nan­des’ slot­ted the spot kick just out of the reach of Martinez for his 15th goal of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>The mid­fielder, who has been di­rectly in­volved in 33 goals in his 30 Premier League ap­pear­ances, urged his team to learn to kill off op­po­nents in­stead of de­fend­ing des­per­ately at the end.</p>
    <p>“We had some sit­u­a­tions to close the game, you have to try and score be­cause we know that teams can score,” he said.</p>
    <p>“If we close the game early it is bet­ter. We have to learn from this.”</p>
    <p>United next face ri­vals Manch­ester City in the semi-fi­nals of the League Cup on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>As­ton Villa boss Smith was up­set with his side’s dis­play in the first half, when United had at least 10 at­tempts.</p>
    <p>“I wasn’t happy with the first half. We were miles off the lev­els where we have been,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It felt like a tes­ti­mo­nial pace then they de­servedly had the lead at half-time.</p>
    <p>“I told the play­ers we needed to be up­ping our lev­els.”</p>
