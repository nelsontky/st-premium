    <p>The coronaviru­s out­break is tak­ing a toll on the coun­try’s men­tal health, with the num­ber of sui­cides ris­ing as a re­sult.</p>
    <p>A 35-year-old jockey and a 50-year-old hawker, be­lieved to be fac­ing fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties be­cause of the out­break, were found dead in May dur­ing Malaysia’s move­ment curbs. The jockey had not been work­ing since the move­ment con­trol or­der (MCO) was im­posed on March 18.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month in Pe­nang, a teenager was found dead af­ter her mother was un­able to re­turn home from Sin­ga­pore to at­tend a cel­e­bra­tion of her com­ing of age.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts say many peo­ple are find­ing it hard to cope with the iso­la­tion and eco­nomic hard­ship re­lated to the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing in iso­la­tion in­creases the fear and help­less­ness that some­one feels, and this can lead to anx­i­ety and de­pres­sion,” Mr Ardy Ayadali, pub­lic­ity direc­tor of emo­tional sup­port help cen­tre Be­frien­ders Kuala Lumpur, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“When some­one is iso­lated in crowded fam­i­lies or spa­ces, the en­vi­ron­ment can get toxic.”</p>
    <p>The lo­cal me­dia had re­ported a spike in calls to women’s aid groups over do­mes­tic vi­o­lence dur­ing the MCO.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the po­lice, there were 78 sui­cides na­tion­wide from when the shut­down be­gan un­til June 9. There were 64 sui­cides in the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Malaysian think-tank The Cen­tre said in April that in a study it con­ducted, it found that some 45 per cent of 1,084 Malaysian re­spon­dents were ex­pe­ri­enc­ing vary­ing lev­els of anx­i­ety and de­pres­sion dur­ing the MCO.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 34 per cent of 4,142 calls re­ceived by Be­frien­ders be­tween March 18 and May 16 were re­lated to the out­break. Over a third of the calls about Covid-19 were sui­ci­dal in na­ture.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry also re­ported that it re­ceived some 2,500 phone calls and more than 1,000 What­sApp mes­sages be­tween March 28 and April 12, dur­ing the early days of the MCO, on its Psy­cho­log­i­cal First Aid hot­line.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing to ad­just to sud­den changes re­lated to the move­ment re­stric­tion, and face un­cer­tain­ties in their fi­nances, em­ploy­ment, ed­u­ca­tion and even ob­tain­ing daily pro­vi­sions or food sup­plies can be “very stress­ful, es­pe­cially in more re­mote ar­eas, and may worsen lone­li­ness and in­crease the risk of do­mes­tic vi­o­lence”, said Dr Ng Yin Ping, a con­sul­tant psy­chi­a­trist from Pan­tai Hospi­tal in Pe­nang.</p>
    <p>Be­frien­ders has also re­ceived calls from those in quar­an­tine cen­tres who were suf­fer­ing from anx­i­ety due to the iso­la­tion, said Mr Ardy.</p>
    <p>While so­cial move­ment curbs are aimed at pro­tect­ing Malaysians from a con­ta­gious and po­ten­tially fa­tal virus, they in­ad­ver­tently put peo­ple at risk of de­te­ri­o­rat­ing men­tal health.</p>
    <p>As busi­nesses ground to a halt, the crip­pled econ­omy caused many to lose their jobs and in­comes.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s un­em­ploy­ment rate climbed to 5.3 per cent in May from 5 per cent in April, ac­cord­ing to the Sta­tis­tics Depart­ment on July 14. Some 10.22 mil­lion re­cip­i­ents have re­ceived coronaviru­s-re­lated aid to­talling RM10.9 bil­lion (S$3.56 bil­lion) as of June 26.</p>
    <p>Malaysia is not alone in this. The pan­demic has the po­ten­tial to be­come a global men­tal health crisis, United Na­tions ex­perts have warned, with many under se­vere psy­cho­log­i­cal strain.</p>
    <p>Nearly 650,000 peo­ple have died and over 16 mil­lion have been in­fected world­wide since the pan­demic was first re­ported in China late last year.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Malaysia be­gan eas­ing its con­trols and re­open­ing non-es­sen­tial sec­tors in May, the num­ber of dis­tress calls to Be­frien­ders re­lated to the out­break be­gan to drop.</p>
    <p>How­ever, ex­perts say the grad­ual re­turn to “nor­malcy” may prove to be another stress­ful ad­just­ment, with so much un­cer­tainty ahead.</p>
    <p>“The eco­nomic re­cov­ery may take a much longer time, thus an over­all in­creased stress on so­ci­ety in gen­eral is an­tic­i­pated,” said con­sul­tant psy­chi­a­trist Teh Ewe Eow, who is part of non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion D’Home Men­tal Health As­so­ci­a­tion of Pe­nang.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey by The Cen­tre also found that 56 per cent of re­spon­dents were more wor­ried about their per­sonal fi­nances af­ter the MCO, com­pared with 47 per cent dur­ing the MCO, as peo­ple recog­nise how the eco­nomic fall­out may last be­yond the re­stric­tions them­selves.</p>
    <p>Those in need of emo­tional sup­port should try to seek help, said ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Dr Ra­vi­varma Panir­sel­vam, a psy­chi­a­trist at Hospi­tal Miri in Sarawak, ad­vised peo­ple ex­pe­ri­enc­ing stress and anx­i­ety to call helplines, such as Be­frien­ders, Mercy Malaysia and Talian Kasih, or ac­cess the near­est clin­ics or hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>He said peo­ple in a sui­ci­dal crisis should seek help at the emer­gency unit of any health­care fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Ardy sug­gested some self-help tips to cope, in­clud­ing stick­ing to a rou­tine and sleep pat­tern, stay­ing phys­i­cally ac­tive, and seek­ing help if it feels like things are get­ting out of con­trol.</p>
    <p>DAN­GERS OF ISO­LA­TION</p>
    <p>Be­ing in iso­la­tion in­creases the fear and help­less­ness that some­one feels, and this can lead to anx­i­ety and de­pres­sion. When some­one is iso­lated in crowded fam­i­lies or spa­ces,</p>
    <p>’’ the en­vi­ron­ment can get toxic.</p>
    <p>MR ARDY AYADALI, pub­lic­ity direc­tor of emo­tional sup­port help cen­tre Be­frien­ders Kuala Lumpur.</p>
