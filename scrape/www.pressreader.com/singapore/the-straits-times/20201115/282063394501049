    <p>We said our good­byes to my mother on Christ­mas Eve, 1996. She had died ear­lier in De­cem­ber after a long and painful ill­ness, but when the end came it was sud­den.</p>
    <p>It can’t have been straight­for­ward to ar­range a fu­neral ser­vice on Christ­mas Eve, the churches be­ing put to other uses, but some­how my fa­ther man­aged it; the chil­dren’s stock­ings were filled as well. I think I speak with some knowl­edge of what does or does not ruin Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>It has been baf­fling, then, to watch the spec­u­la­tion in the Bri­tish press about whether Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son will “save Christ­mas”, as though he were some over-pro­moted elf in a sea­sonal movie. (It is, ad­mit­tedly, a role he is bet­ter qual­i­fied to play than that of prime min­is­ter.)</p>
    <p>Ap­par­ently, the think­ing is that if the coun­try is still in lock­down late next month, Christ­mas is ru­ined. If lock­down is lifted, as ex­pected, early next month, Christ­mas is saved.</p>
    <p>Given how des­per­ate Mr</p>
    <p>John­son is to be liked, my money is on the lat­ter sce­nario.</p>
    <p>What makes this so ab­surd is that in the big scheme of things, Christ­mas doesn’t mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Don’t get me wrong: I love Christ­mas as much as the next man, even if the next man is a re­formed Ebenezer Scrooge. But when it comes to catch­ing up with my fam­ily, I’d rather not risk giv­ing ev­ery­one the un­in­tended gift of Covid-19, whether or not it is le­gal to do so.</p>
    <p>As for the econ­omy, the Christ­mas boom is smaller than you might think.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can econ­o­mist Joel Wald­fo­gel, au­thor of Scrooge­nomics, es­ti­mates that for ev­ery £100 (S$178) we spend across a typ­i­cal year in Bri­tain, just over 50 pence is part of the De­cem­ber Christ­mas boom.</p>
    <p>Of course, some re­tail­ers and restau­rants will be badly hit if Christ­mas spend­ing is pre­vented by lock­down rules. But we should be hon­est about the sit­u­a­tion: Large sec­tions of the econ­omy have al­ready been dev­as­tated, and that would be true with or with­out le­gal re­stric­tions. Few peo­ple want to at­tend pan­tomimes in a pandemic.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 is a pub­lic health disas­ter; lock­downs are an ex­tremely crude and costly re­sponse. Both those facts are true re­gard­less of the time of year. There is an hon­est case both for and against lock­downs, and whether a lock­down hits Christ­mas, Hal­loween or Valen­tine’s Day is barely rel­e­vant.</p>
    <p>Con­sider what makes Christ­mas fun: the gifts, the feast­ing, the carols, the fam­ily re­unions and the tiny tots with their eyes all aglow. The carols are go­ing to have to be out­doors this year, lock­down or no lock­down – Covid-19, it turns out, is un­sen­ti­men­tal about such things. Some of the gifts and the feast­ing will hap­pen any­way, within fam­ily bub­bles. Other fes­tiv­i­ties can be post­poned un­til safe. As for the tots, I pre­dict that Fa­ther Christ­mas will be fill­ing stock­ings come what may.</p>
    <p>No, the rea­son Christ­mas looms large po­lit­i­cally is not that it presents a unique op­por­tu­nity to en­joy our­selves, but that it presents a unique op­por­tu­nity for us all to en­joy our­selves at the same time. “All” is an ex­ag­ger­a­tion; I am aware that some peo­ple do not en­joy Christ­mas, oth­ers cel­e­brate Di­wali or Hanukkah or Eid, and still oth­ers mark Christ­mas on Jan 7. Nev­er­the­less, it is a col­lec­tive cel­e­bra­tion.</p>
    <p>Christ­mas, in­deed, pro­duces one of the few out­bursts of mass hap­pi­ness big enough to be viewed through sen­ti­ment anal­y­sis on Twit­ter. At he­do­nome­ter.org, a team of aca­demics plot pos­i­tive and neg­a­tive emo­tions around the</p>
    <p>world, as mea­sured by the words used in tweets.</p>
    <p>Christ­mas Day reg­u­larly stands out. That is partly be­cause the re­searchers code the word “Christ­mas” as happy. We should not leap to the er­ro­neous con­clu­sion that Christ­mas is a time of un­par­al­leled joy. In­stead, the point is that at Christ­mas, the joy is col­lec­tive, or at least si­mul­ta­ne­ous.</p>
    <p>If you are over the age of nine, it is un­likely that Christ­mas Day is</p>
    <p>go­ing to be the best day of your year. But it has a good shout of be­ing in the top 10. That is why the news­pa­pers are pay­ing at­ten­tion; that is why the gov­ern­ment is des­per­ate not to “ruin” Christ­mas. But it is also some­thing for each one of us to keep in pro­por­tion.</p>
    <p>It is per­fectly pos­si­ble to savour many of the joys of Christ­mas – the feast­ing, the fam­ily and the fun – at any time of the year. But this time we might not be do­ing so si­mul­ta­ne­ously – and can you imag­ine the re­sult­ing head­lines if we could not?</p>
    <p>Each of us should be think­ing about what we re­ally value about Christ­mas and how to sus­tain those val­ues re­gard­less of cir­cum­stances. And, in any case, there will be other Christ­mases.</p>
    <p>Of course, for some peo­ple that is not true. Some peo­ple will not see an­other Christ­mas and may be des­per­ate to see and hug their fam­i­lies one last time. Oth­ers are iso­lated in nurs­ing homes, un­able to see friends. De­men­tia suf­fer­ers, per­fectly ca­pa­ble of en­joy­ing a friendly face-to-face visit, of­ten strug­gle to in­ter­act through Skype or a closed win­dow, or with some­one in a mask.</p>
    <p>But let’s keep Christ­mas out of that de­bate. The iso­la­tion of peo­ple in nurs­ing homes is in­tol­er­a­ble. It is also in­tol­er­a­ble to ex­pose ev­ery­one in a home to a high risk of a Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>This is yet an­other of the painful choices we are mak­ing as a so­ci­ety. It is not clear to me that we are get­ting it right. But I am con­fi­dent of one fact: For this dilemma, Christ­mas is a sideshow.</p>
    <p>My mother’s death hit us all hard. She was young, and so were we. Maybe it would have been eas­ier to bear if she had died in­stead in November or, suf­fer­ing ter­ri­bly, en­dured un­til Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>But I do not think so.</p>
