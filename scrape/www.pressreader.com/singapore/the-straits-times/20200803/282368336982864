    <p>When you dance, your pur­pose is not to get to a cer­tain place on the floor. It's to en­joy each step along the way. Wayne Dyer</p>
    <p>I can­celled my an­nual travel in­sur­ance re­cently, as I have no idea when I will be able to go on a va­ca­tion overseas.</p>
    <p>I used to make about six overseas trips a year, mostly over long week­ends, hop­ping over to Phuket or Pe­nang. A feel­ing of sad­ness de­scends upon me as thoughts of no longer be­ing able to travel linger in my mind. I miss trav­el­ling.</p>
    <p>Sad­ness or low moods are as­so­ci­ated with neg­a­tive thoughts. Re­al­is­ing what was hap­pen­ing, I took a deep breath to bring my mind back to the present mo­ment, let­ting go of the thoughts of travel.</p>
    <p>The thoughts of trav­el­ling, in this in­stance, were neg­a­tive be­cause trav­el­ling is an un­ful­fil­l­able de­sire. With no pos­si­bil­ity of an overseas va­ca­tion in the fore­see­able fu­ture, there is no point in pon­der­ing it. I shall in­stead fo­cus my mind and en­ergy on plan­ning what can real­is­ti­cally hap­pen.</p>
    <p>Our minds are, by de­fault, in­clined to rem­i­nisce about the past, usu­ally the less-than-pleas­ant parts.</p>
    <p>When­ever mem­o­ries of my late brother sur­face, I can feel my hap­pi­ness fad­ing away and a sense of tight­en­ing in my chest.</p>
    <p>He passed away af­ter suc­cumb­ing to brain in­juries caused by a mas­sive stroke, which hap­pened in the middle of the night, when he woke up to go to the toi­let, in Septem­ber 2018. Recol­lect­ing this also brings back mem­o­ries of un­pleas­ant en­coun­ters with a rel­a­tive dur­ing hos­pi­tal vis­its over the nine months of his grad­ual de­cline.</p>
    <p>Un­pleas­ant mem­o­ries don’t of­fer any joy, yet the mind is in­clined to re­trieve the less pleas­ant mem­o­ries rather than the pleas­ant ones. It is this kind of ru­mi­na­tion that sets some­one on the path of de­pres­sion. Re­fo­cus­ing the mind on the present un­latches the mind from ru­mi­na­tion that will in­voke only sad­ness and re­sent­ment.</p>
    <p>Aware­ness of what is hap­pen­ing in the mind, as it is hap­pen­ing, is what en­ables a mind­ful­ness prac­ti­tioner to in­ter­vene in bring­ing the mind back to the present. Reg­u­lar mind­ful­ness prac­tice en­hances this aware­ness so the mind is not lost in the web of neg­a­tive thoughts.</p>
    <p>A Har­vard Univer­sity neu­ro­sci­en­tist, Dr Sara Lazar, re­vealed in her re­search in­volv­ing fMRI (func­tional mag­netic res­o­nance imag­ing) tech­nol­ogy that the brain is re­shaped by reg­u­lar mind­ful­ness prac­tice.</p>
    <p>The thick­en­ing of the in­sula and the pre-frontal cor­tex of the brain re­sults in an en­hanced aware­ness of body sen­sa­tions and the abil­ity to re­fo­cus.</p>
    <p>This en­ables a mind­ful in­ter­ven­tion that shifts the mind back to be­ing present more quickly, thus let­ting go of un­pleas­ant mem­o­ries or thoughts of an un­de­sir­able fu­ture. This is what brings about men­tal re­silience.</p>
    <p>Mind­ful­ness helped me to emerge from panic at­tacks and de­pres­sion that set upon me in 2011, af­ter years of ac­cu­mu­lated stress at work com­bined with the col­lapse of my mar­riage and car­ing for my mother who had de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>My mind’s con­stant zip­ping into the past brought about feel­ings of re­sent­ment, re­gret, guilt and de­spair. In ad­di­tion, the imag­i­na­tion of a bleak and dark fu­ture piled on the sense of help­less­ness and hope­less­ness.</p>
    <p>My mind also played the blame game – twist­ing facts with blame, caus­ing it to spi­ral into a dark and tor­ment­ing tun­nel. The emo­tional pain was ex­cru­ci­at­ing and the mus­cles in my chest felt as if they were be­ing wrung, suf­fo­cat­ing me to the point of breath­less­ness. Liv­ing with a twisted mind brought about a twisted ex­is­tence.</p>
    <p>Thoughts of end­ing my life arose, as it was the mind’s way of call­ing for re­lief. I un­der­stood at that point what feel­ing sui­ci­dal meant. Cut­ting my arms was also sug­gested by my mind, as it would help to dis­tract and bring re­lief from the in­tense emo­tional pain. I was los­ing weight as I had no ap­petite. Food tasted flat, just like life.</p>
    <p>Think­ing that the rea­son I couldn’t breathe well was that I had can­cer, I went for a chest X-ray.</p>
    <p>The pain in my chest felt like a heart at­tack. For­tu­nately, a doc­tor friend saved me from the em­bar­rass­ment of call­ing the am­bu­lance that would have taken me to the hos­pi­tal A&E, only to dis­cover it was an anx­i­ety at­tack.</p>
    <p>When I re­alised what was hap­pen­ing, it was time to ap­ply all the mind­ful­ness tools and tech­niques I had learnt over the years to heal my mind and body.</p>
    <p>Dili­gent prac­tice in bring­ing the mind back to the present ex­tracted it from the depths of dark­ness.</p>
    <p>This – to­gether with ac­cept­ing what has hap­pened can­not be changed, as well as for­giv­ing my­self and those who had hurt me – en­abled me to let go of the blam­ing thoughts that had sent me into de­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>Step by step, my mind emerged from the tun­nel of tor­ment.</p>
    <p>Heal­ing is a process and mind­ful­ness cer­tainly en­abled me to re­cover with­out the need for med­i­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Learn­ing mind­ful­ness is like in­oc­u­lat­ing the mind against anx­i­ety and de­pres­sion. It may not pre­vent them com­pletely, but it re­duces their ef­fects, and the abil­ity to re­cover from anx­i­ety or de­pres­sion is much quicker.</p>
    <p>The oc­cur­rence of anx­i­ety and de­pres­sion is on the rise, es­pe­cially in th­ese times when peo­ple’s health and jobs are un­der threat.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 is also an emo­tional con­ta­gion, caus­ing some to feel a deep sense of fear or hope­less­ness. Imag­in­ing the worst of what the fu­ture holds is only go­ing to be detri­men­tal to our men­tal health. Be­ing able to take one day at a time and ap­pre­ci­at­ing what we have in the present will en­able us to stay re­silient.</p>
