    <p>In­vestors had bit more of a spring in their step yes­ter­day, thanks to op­ti­mistic talk about coro­n­avirus vac­cines, an­other pos­i­tive ses­sion on Wall Street and high hopes about the up­com­ing United States Fed­eral Re­serve pol­icy meet­ing.</p>
    <p>While hardly a day of ex­u­ber­ance, the Straits Times In­dex (STI) did man­age to add 19.32 points, or 0.78 per cent, to end at 2,505.15, close to its in­tra-day high of 2,508.16.</p>
    <p>Gain­ers out­paced losers 254 to 157 on trade of 1.48 bil­lion shares worth $1.14 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The best per­form­ing in­dex com­po­nent by a long way was Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries, which has been steadily edg­ing higher over the past few days after sep­a­rat­ing it­self from its off­shore and ma­rine unit.</p>
    <p>The shares broke into a full gal­lop yes­ter­day, shoot­ing up 8.9 per cent to $1.34.</p>
    <p>Other STI stocks had a good day as well, in­clud­ing the Jar­dine sta­ble, as well as an­a­lyst favourites Wil­mar In­ter­na­tional and Com­fortDel­gro, which was given a help­ing hand by re­ports that the Land Trans­port Author­ity has ex­tended rental re­lief for taxi and pri­vate hire car driv­ers un­til March next year.</p>
    <p>The trans­port gi­ant ad­vanced 2.68 per cent to $1.53, while Wil­mar rose 3.12 per cent to $4.30.</p>
    <p>At the other end of the spec­trum, the three lo­cal lenders – DBS Bank, OCBC Bank and UOB – ended the day weaker. UOB was the big­gest loser of all the STI com­po­nent stocks, fall­ing 0.62 per cent to $19.30.</p>
    <p>Among the smaller-cap stocks,</p>
    <p>Shin­vest Hold­ing (for­merly known as East­gate Tech­nol­ogy) rock­eted 21.38 per cent to $3.35.</p>
    <p>This came after the com­pany made a fur­ther an­nounce­ment re­lated to its pro­posed dis­posal of its 6 per cent stake in Es­pres­sif Sys­tems (Shang­hai), a com­pany listed in China with a mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion of 13.4 bil­lion yuan (S$2.7 bil­lion). Shin­vest’s own mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion is about $100 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>On the coro­n­avirus front, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said the US might have a vac­cine ready in four weeks. Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal gi­ant Pfizer is re­port­edly see­ing promis­ing results in test­ing.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, a Chi­nese sci­en­tist was quoted as say­ing that China may have vac­cines ready for pub­lic use as early as Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Else­where, Hong Kong stocks dipped, fol­low­ing three days of gains while Seoul’s Kospi ended four days of gains, with traders tread­ing care­fully ahead of the US Fed meet­ing.</p>
    <p>Strong sup­port across all sec­tors lifted Aus­tralian shares by 1 per cent – the most in a week – on the back of a buoy­ant Wall Street and bet­ter-than-ex­pected eco­nomic num­bers in the US and China.</p>
