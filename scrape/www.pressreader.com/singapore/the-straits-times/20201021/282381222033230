    <p>Thomas Muller can fur­ther fuel ap­peals for him to be re­called by Ger­many when Bay­ern Mu­nich launch their Cham­pi­ons League ti­tle de­fence at home to Atletico Madrid today.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing man­aged a record 21 as­sists in the Bun­desliga last sea­son, he has con­tin­ued his sparkling form this cam­paign by scor­ing five goals and cre­at­ing four more in all com­pe­ti­tions, in­clud­ing two goals in a 4-1 league win at Ar­minia Biele­feld last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>His lat­est eye-catch­ing club per­for­mance has prompted fresh hopes of a Ger­many re­call for the 31-year-old, who was dropped by Joachim Low from the na­tional setup last year along­side Jerome Boateng and Mats Hum­mels.</p>
    <p>Now Bas­tian Sch­we­in­steiger has joined fel­low for­mer Bay­ern and Ger­many play­ers Didi Ha­mann and Lothar Matthaus in call­ing for the for­ward to be re­in­stated.</p>
    <p>“If I was na­tional coach, Muller as well as Boateng would be in the na­tional side,” he told Ger­man mag­a­zine Kicker.</p>
    <p>The 36-year-old Sch­we­in­steiger won the 2014 World Cup in Brazil along­side Muller, who knows he still has plenty to of­fer Ger­many af­ter 100 in­ter­na­tion­als and 38 goals.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one can see that I am in good form. Let’s just see what hap­pens,” Muller told broad­caster ZDF.</p>
    <p>Bay­ern will need his cre­ativ­ity against an Atletico side who have con­ceded just one goal in four La Liga games so far this sea­son.</p>
    <p>The Bavar­i­ans have a per­fect record at home against Diego Sime­one’s side, hav­ing twice beaten them in Mu­nich in 2016.</p>
    <p>Yet Atletico knocked Bay­ern out in the semi-fi­nals in 2015-16 and the Ger­man side re­main wary of their Span­ish op­po­nents.</p>
    <p>Goal­keeper Manuel Neuer warned that Atletico are a “strong team” who were “un­com­fort­able” to play against.</p>
    <p>On Satur­day, coach Hansi Flick crit­i­cised his team for a poor sec­ond-half per­for­mance, af­ter in­di­vid­ual er­rors led to a goal for Biele­feld and a red card for Bay­ern’s Corentin Tolisso. They can ill-af­ford a re­peat against Atletico.</p>
    <p>Joshua Kim­mich should bring more sta­bil­ity to Bay­ern’s mid­field, with the Ger­many mid­fielder ex­pected to re­turn af­ter he missed Satur­day’s game to be with his wife, who is ex­pect­ing the cou­ple’s sec­ond child.</p>
