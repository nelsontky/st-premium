    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) • As the Na­tional Basketball As­so­ci­a­tion’s (NBA) scor­ing cham­pion for the past three sea­sons, James Harden’s of­fen­sive prow­ess is be­yond ques­tion.</p>
    <p>But his de­fen­sive con­tri­bu­tion or lack thereof has led to plenty of jibes. Many have pointed out it is part of the rea­son why the Hous­ton Rock­ets are seen as play-off “chok­ers”, like when they lost in the 2015 Western Con­fer­ence Fi­nals and in the sec­ond round two years later.</p>
    <p>Harden has re­served some of his worst ca­reer per­for­mances when it counts the most and Wed­nes­day was no dif­fer­ent. He was dis­mal on the night, scor­ing just 17 points on four-of-15 shoot­ing.</p>
    <p>But while his touch de­serted him at one end of the floor, he came up big on the de­fen­sive end as Hous­ton clinched a 104-102 Game 7 de­cid­ing win over the Ok­la­homa City Thun­der, claim­ing the se­ries 4-3.</p>
    <p>The guard man­aged to block a po­ten­tial game-win­ning three-point at­tempt by Thun­der rookie Luguentz Dort – who fin­ished with a game-high 30 points – with just 4.8 se­conds re­main­ing and the Rock­ets lead­ing by a point.</p>
    <p>Team­mate Robert Cov­ing­ton hit a free throw to make it 104 with 1.4 se­conds left be­fore Thun­der for­ward Danilo Gal­li­nari missed from the foul line.</p>
    <p>Ok­la­homa City then turned the ball over on the fi­nal in-bounds pass, seal­ing the Rock­ets’ progress to the West semi-fi­nals.</p>
    <p>Ref­er­enc­ing rap star Nipsey Hus­sle, who was mur­dered last year, Harden ad­mit­ted he had to do some­thing to make up for his off night, say­ing: “Like Hus­sle said, never let a hard time hum­ble us.</p>
    <p>“Of­fen­sively, I played like s***. Ex­cuse my lan­guage. I couldn’t make a shot, turn­ing the ball over, just ev­ery­thing that was not sup­posed to hap­pen. But I just kept stick­ing with it and de­fen­sively, I had to make a play.</p>
    <p>“It’s cool to get 40 or 50 points or shoot the ball ex­tremely well... But for it to pay off when it counts on the de­fen­sive end, it shows that I’ve been en­gaged and locked in.</p>
    <p>“For it to show in a clutch mo­ment, it means a lot.”</p>
    <p>Fel­low All-Star Rus­sell West­brook, who had 20 points to elim­i­nate his for­mer team, later told re­porters de­fence was ac­tu­ally an un­der­rated part of Harden’s game.</p>
    <p>“James has been play­ing de­fence,” the guard said of his team­mate, who leads the league in steals this sea­son with 125.</p>
    <p>“I think if me­dia and peo­ple ac­tu­ally look at the num­bers, then you’ll get your answers. James de­fends.”</p>
    <p>Hous­ton coach Mike D’An­toni added: “You know how the nar­ra­tives go. Once you get stuck with a la­bel, it’s tough for NBA play­ers to shed that la­bel.</p>
    <p>“He’s been locked in, and I think he knows that for us to be able to win at a good clip, the de­fence has to be there. He’s just tak­ing the chal­lenge and do­ing a great job.”</p>
    <p>Harden will have to re­main switched on, with their match-up against the Western Con­fer­ence top seeds and cham­pi­onship con­tenders, the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers, start­ing to­day.</p>
    <p>LeBron James and Co have had al­most a week’s rest to pre­pare for the first post-sea­son con­test be­tween the two teams in 11 years.</p>
