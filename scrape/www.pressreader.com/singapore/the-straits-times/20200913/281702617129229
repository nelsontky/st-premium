    <p>Two weeks af­ter odd-even en­try re­stric­tions kicked in on week­ends at Lucky Plaza, business own­ers have ap­pealed to the au­thor­i­ties to re­lax the Covid-19 rules, which they said have severely af­fected their bot­tom lines.</p>
    <p>As of yes­ter­day, at least two pe­ti­tions call­ing for the re­stric­tions to be re­v­ersed have been cre­ated, as some busi­nesses said they have been strug­gling to break even since the rules were im­posed.</p>
    <p>But the au­thor­i­ties said they are not in­clined to lift the curbs, given mul­ti­ple breaches and the mall’s fail­ure to ad­here to safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures that led to the need for stricter rules in the first place.</p>
    <p>Last month, the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) and En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore worked with the man­age­ment of Lucky Plaza and Penin­sula Plaza to im­ple­ment the en­try re­stric­tions on week­ends from Aug 29.</p>
    <p>The agen­cies said the rules were nec­es­sary as the two malls at­tract large crowds and had per­sis­tent crowd­ing is­sues es­pe­cially on week­ends, de­spite the de­ploy­ment of ad­di­tional en­force­ment of­fi­cers and safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors to en­sure com­pli­ance.</p>
    <p>Un­der the re­stric­tions, those whose NRIC/FIN num­bers end in even dig­its can visit the two malls only on even dates, while those whose num­bers end in odd dig­its can visit only on odd dates.</p>
    <p>But this has dealt a big blow to Lucky Plaza’s week­end sales num­bers, which had just be­gun a ten­ta­tive re­cov­ery fol­low­ing the end of the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Mr Ho Chee Yew, 45, who owns an eatery there, said his week­end rev­enue has dropped by 95 per cent and he is strug­gling to make his monthly rent of $7,000.</p>
    <p>“In­gre­di­ents cost me about $450 per day, but my sales last Sun­day were only about $400,” he said.</p>
    <p>To­gether with shoe shop owner John Cheng, 62, Mr Ho or­gan­ised a paper pe­ti­tion that had been signed by 100 Lucky Plaza business own­ers as of Fri­day af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>The mall has about 500 re­tail units, and some own­ers rent more than one.</p>
    <p>Ms Jhen Tamayao, 48, who runs a business sell­ing Filipino beauty and food prod­ucts, said last Sun­day was the first time in 18 years at the mall that her sales fell to just $300, com­pared with her usual tak­ings of be­tween $1,200 and $2,000 on Sun</p>
    <p>days. An on­line pe­ti­tion she launched on Wednesday had been signed by 171 peo­ple as of last night.</p>
    <p>But the de­ci­sion to im­ple­ment odd-even re­stric­tions came af­ter a string of softer crowd con­trol mea­sures could not ad­dress the crowd­ing sit­u­a­tion, STB said.</p>
    <p>In an e-mail to Lucky Plaza’s man­age­ment and a few shop­keep­ers dated Sept 10, STB said it de­ployed at the mall “far more re­sources than what we have had to ded­i­cate to the rest of Orchard Road as a whole”, in­clud­ing seven safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors ev­ery Sun­day, as the mall man­age­ment was not able to man­age the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Even with th­ese mea­sures, STB said it re­ceived nu­mer­ous pub­lic feed­back each week that high­lighted the mall’s fail­ure in en­sur­ing safe man­age­ment mea­sures are ad</p>
    <p>hered to, putting the pub­lic at risk.</p>
    <p>“As the Man­age­ment Cor­po­ra­tion Strata Ti­tle man­age­ment as well as the business own­ers have not been able to man­age the crowd­ing and en­sure safe man­age­ment mea­sures are ad­hered to, we are not in­clined for the en­try re­stric­tions to be dis­con­tin­ued,” it said. “This is to safe­guard the health and safety of shop­pers and work­ers, as well as the gen­eral pub­lic.”</p>
    <p>Ms Ranita Sun­dramoor­thy, STB’s di­rec­tor for re­tail and din­ing, told The Sun­day Times that seven es­tab­lish­ments in Lucky Plaza, as well as the mall’s man­age­ment, have been fined $1,000 each for fail­ing to en­sure safe dis­tanc­ing be­tween cus­tomers in queues or ar­eas within the premises.</p>
    <p>But shop own­ers said they have tried to ad­here to the rules, even hir</p>
    <p>ing more hands to help. A week­end be­fore the odd-even re­stric­tions, Ms Tamayao brought in a part-timer to en­force SafeEn­try and take cus­tomers’ tem­per­a­tures at her shop.</p>
    <p>Ms Sun­dramoor­thy said the odd­e­ven re­stric­tion has helped to ad­dress pub­lic con­cerns and min­imise trans­mis­sion risks – while keep­ing busi­nesses open, she added.</p>
    <p>STB told shop own­ers it will con­tinue to mon­i­tor the sit­u­a­tion, and will re­con­sider its view “if and when the sit­u­a­tion im­proves”.</p>
    <p>For now, stay­ing open would only mean more losses, said Ms Tamayao. “Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker there was rental re­lief, but there is no way out for us now,” she said. “With­out any help, our busi­nesses will be un­sus­tain­able.”</p>
