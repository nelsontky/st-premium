    <p>These 10 re­leases by Sin­ga­porean acts in the past month in­clude both up­lift­ing tracks and som­bre tunes.</p>
    <p>While R&B trio brb. and singer, song­writer and pro­ducer Yao cel­e­brate pos­i­tiv­ity in their perky sin­gles, singers like Nathan Hartono and Do­minic Chin are con­tem­pla­tive in their tracks.</p>
    <p>Also on the list are turntab­list and DJ Koflow’s new al­bum, as well as rap­per TheLionCit­yBoy’s ode to the circuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>1 HIP-HOP/ELEC­TRONIC AMAZ­ING</p>
    <p>Yung Raja, Alyph and Tri­fect</p>
    <p>Hear it on: Spo­tify, Ap­ple Mu­sic and other mu­sic stream­ing plat­forms Watch it on: bit.ly/2GfQkAm</p>
    <p>Rap­pers Yung Raja and Alyph team up with elec­tronic pro­ducer Tri­fect for their new sin­gle, Amaz­ing.</p>
    <p>Yung Raja says that the up­lift­ing song was de­signed to brighten up the lis­tener’s day. “I wanted to cre­ate some­thing that makes peo­ple feel good, that has an up­lift­ing and bright vibe to it.”</p>
    <p>Alyph adds that the song is ded­i­cated to all lis­ten­ers, re­gard­less of age. “I wanted to write some­thing which young kids could fol­low and young adults could en­joy, and some­thing for the older gen­er­a­tion to feel the mu­sic.”</p>
    <p>2 R&B/POP/ELEC­TRONIC MORN­ING DANCE</p>
    <p>Yao</p>
    <p>Hear it on: Spo­tify, Ap­ple Mu­sic and other mu­sic stream­ing plat­forms Watch it on: bit.ly/2GkL4vr</p>
    <p>Singer, song­writer and pro­ducer Yao’s lat­est sin­gle Morn­ing Dance is de­signed as an in­spi­ra­tional pop track to start one’s day.</p>
    <p>He de­scribes the tune as an “ex­pres­sion of know­ing that there is truly so much to live for and that be­ing able to wake up alive ev­ery day is truly a bless­ing”.</p>
    <p>Yao, who first made waves with the 2018 sin­gle Scenery, won the New Kid On The Block prize in the in­au­gu­ral Sin­ga­pore Youth Mu­sic Awards 2019.</p>
    <p>3 HIP-HOP/ELEC­TRONIC METEM</p>
    <p>Koflow</p>
    <p>Hear it on: Spo­tify, Ap­ple Mu­sic and other mu­sic stream­ing plat­forms Watch it on: bit.ly/2Ga1UNv</p>
    <p>One of the most prom­i­nent turntab­lists on the Sin­ga­pore scene, Koflow is back with a new al­bum, Metem. The palin­dromic moniker is taken from metempsy­chosis, a philo­soph­i­cal con­cept of the trans­mi­gra­tion of the soul.</p>
    <p>More than just a hip-hop al­bum, the nine num­bers see the vet­eran DJ ex­pand his chops as a pro­ducer, craft­ing im­mer­sive in­stru­men­tals that take on gen­res from funk and drum and bass to dub­step and trap.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>POP/R&B DIG DEEP</p>
    <p>Nathan Hartono Hear it on: Spo­tify, Ap­ple Mu­sic and other mu­sic stream­ing plat­forms</p>
    <p>Watch it on: bit.ly/3lqp6af</p>
    <p>Fresh from sing­ing this year’s Na­tional Day Pa­rade theme song Ev­ery­thing I Am, Nathan Hartono (above) has re­leased the English ver­sion of his song Dig Deep. The Man­darin ver­sion was re­leased in December last year.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean singer-song­writer, who also di­rected the new mu­sic video, says the song is about the strug­gle of try­ing to be open.</p>
    <p>“Dig Deep is a song about ex­plor­ing one’s vul­ner­a­bil­ity. It’s never easy and is of­ten­times a con­fronting process. The video to this song is a rep­re­sen­ta­tion of that idea, of some­one try­ing to face him­self and mak­ing an hon­est ef­fort to dig deeper into his heart.”</p>
    <p>To mark the song’s release, Hartono do­nated meals to an­i­mal shel­ter An­i­mal Lovers League.</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>IN­DIE POP/ACOUS­TIC PRO­LOGUE; EULOGIA</p>
    <p>Deon</p>
    <p>Hear it on: Spo­tify, Ap­ple Mu­sic and other mu­sic stream­ing plat­forms Watch it on: bit.ly/32NTNhh</p>
    <p>Singer-song­writer Deon’s EP pro­logue; eulogia fea­tures acous­tic ren­di­tions of four songs from his third al­bum eulogia; eu­logy (2019).</p>
    <p>He says: “I wanted lis­ten­ers to ex­pe­ri­ence the songs as they were writ­ten. Al­though it might be tough to pull back the lay­ers and ex­pose the core of my song­writ­ing, I feel it brings me closer to au­di­ences and pro­vides a more in­ti­mate ex­pe­ri­ence”.</p>
    <p>The tunes in­clude Change Of Heart, which fea­tures fel­low home-grown singer-song­writer Dru Chen. Other acts who ap­pear on the EP in­clude home-grown singer Mindy Kon and Sho­hei Ue­mura, the Ja­panese singer who ap­peared on the Net­flix re­al­ity show Ter­race House: Open­ing New Doors (2017 to 2019).</p>
    <p>6</p>
    <p>R&B/POP DON’T SAY IT</p>
    <p>Sarah X. Mir­a­cle</p>
    <p>Hear it on: Spo­tify, Ap­ple Mu­sic and other mu­sic stream­ing plat­forms Watch it on: bit.ly/3lFvKJE</p>
    <p>Don’t Say It is the first sin­gle by Sarah X. Mir­a­cle, the new per­sona for bilin­gual singer-song­writer Sarah Cheng-De Winne. The em­pow­er­ing song from her up­com­ing three-part EP en­cour­ages women to recog­nise their self-worth and not feel sorry for let­ting a man down.</p>
    <p>7</p>
    <p>HIP-HOP</p>
    <p>CIR­CUS BREAKER TheLionCit­yBoy Hear it on: Ap­ple Mu­sic, Spo­tify and other mu­sic stream­ing plat­forms</p>
    <p>Watch it on: bit.ly/31zSL8T</p>
    <p>The EP Cir­cus Breaker by TheLionCit­yBoy (above) was com­posed and recorded at home dur­ing the circuit breaker.</p>
    <p>While the songs fea­ture on­line col­lab­o­ra­tions with other hip-hop acts and pro­duc­ers such as Akeem Ja­hat and Kidmed­dling, the rap­per did a lot of the pro­duc­tion work him­self.</p>
    <p>He used his iPhone to record him­self and take notes when­ever ideas came to him and au­dio-edit­ing soft­ware Logic Pro X on his MacBook Pro lap­top to put the tracks together.</p>
    <p>“It was ex­cit­ing to put this project together so quickly,” he says. “Hon­estly, these last few months have been quite a roller-coaster of emo­tions, with us not know­ing where 2020 will take us next. I know all I can do is just fo­cus on my art, my fam­ily and my jour­ney. I put all that en­ergy into these tracks.”</p>
    <p>8</p>
    <p>POP DON’T YOU KNOW YET?</p>
    <p>Gen­tle Bones and Tay Kewei</p>
    <p>Hear it on: Spo­tify, Ap­ple Mu­sic and other mu­sic stream­ing plat­forms Watch it on: bit.ly/3lyWTy1</p>
    <p>Singer-song­writer Gen­tle Bones (left), whose real name is Joel Tan, makes his Man­dopop de­but with Don’t You Know Yet?, a duet with fel­low home-grown singer­song­writer Tay Kewei (far left).</p>
    <p>He says of work­ing with Tay: “As she is highly pro­fi­cient in Man­darin, I was afraid she wouldn’t like the song at first, so I am so happy she de­cided to come on board to team with me.”</p>
    <p>Tay says she was “elated” to work with Tan on his first Man­darin song. “I have heard his English works and they have never dis­ap­pointed me as they were catchy with head-bop­ping tunes.”</p>
    <p>De­scribed as the flip side to a typ­i­cal fairy-tale love story, the lyrics ex­plore how cou­ples in re­la­tion­ships run through emo­tions rang­ing from love to heartache.</p>
    <p>9</p>
    <p>ELEC­TROPOP ALONE Do­minic Chin Hear it on: Spo­tify, Ap­ple Mu­sic and other mu­sic stream­ing plat­forms</p>
    <p>Watch it on: bit.ly/3lyUGTg</p>
    <p>Singer-song­writer Do­minic Chin opens up about liv­ing with anx­i­ety dis­or­der on his melan­cholic sin­gle, Alone. He says: “The song talks about feel­ing con­flicted about my re­la­tion­ships, be­ing to­tally de­feated and yearn­ing for some help while I fight my bat­tles with feel­ing dis­ori­en­tated by all that is go­ing on in my mind.”</p>
    <p>It is also a tune for those fac­ing a sim­i­lar predica­ment. “It’s a song to let peo­ple who strug­gle with anx­i­ety is­sues like me know that they are not alone, and that I, too, strug­gle with it on a day-to-day ba­sis and I’m still here.”</p>
    <p>10</p>
    <p>R&B</p>
    <p>MY TYPE brb.</p>
    <p>Hear it on: Spo­tify, Ap­ple Mu­sic and other mu­sic stream­ing plat­forms</p>
    <p>Watch it on: bit.ly/31K67j2</p>
    <p>R&B trio brb. are look­ing at the bright side of life with their sin­gle, My Type. As they say in a state­ment: “We hope to in­tro­duce a dif­fer­ent en­ergy into our up­com­ing re­leases. Our EP re­la­tionsh*t was rather som­bre and we wanted to write hap­pier songs this time round.”</p>
    <p>They are ex­pected to release their sopho­more EP next year.</p>
