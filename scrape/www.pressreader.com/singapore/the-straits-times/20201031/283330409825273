    <p>A London j udge on Thurs­day agreed to de­lay the trial phase of Meghan Markle’s high­pro­file law­suit against a Bri­tish news­pa­per group for pri­vacy and copy­right breaches.</p>
    <p>Judge Mark Warby said he had ap­proved an ap­pli­ca­tion by the Duchess of Sus­sex’s lawyers for the trial to be ad­journed from Jan­uary un­til “much later next year”.</p>
    <p>The “pri­mary ba­sis” for the de­lay was on “a con­fi­den­tial ground”, he added af­ter a pri­vate hear­ing at the High Court in London.</p>
    <p>“The right de­ci­sion in all the cir­cum­stances is to grant the ap­pli­ca­tion to ad­journ,” he said.</p>
    <p>“That means that the trial date of Jan­uary 11, 2021, will be va­cated and the trial will be re-fixed for a new date in the au­tumn.”</p>
    <p>Markle, 39, who with her hus­band Prince Harry, 36, is wag­ing an in­creas­ingly pub­lic war with some me­dia out­lets, is su­ing the pub­lish­ers of the Mail on Sun­day, Daily Mail and MailOn­line.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can for­mer tele­vi­sion ac­tress claims As­so­ci­ated News­pa­pers breached her pri­vacy, dat­apro­tec­tion rights and copy­right by pub­lish­ing ex­tracts of cor­re­spon­dence with her es­tranged fa­ther, Thomas, be­fore she mar­ried Harry.</p>
    <p>The High Court last month al­lowed the news­pa­per group to amend its de­fence against the claim, to al­lege the cou­ple co­op­er­ated on a re­cent book about their lives to­gether.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ated ac­cuses Markle of giv­ing the au­thors Omid Sco­bie and Carolyn Du­rand de­tails about the let­ter to por­tray her ver­sion of events in a more favourable light.</p>
    <p>The news group also claims she wanted to use the hand­writ­ten let­ter “as part of a me­dia strat­egy” and dis­cussed it with royal com­mu­ni­ca­tions of­fi­cials be­fore it was sent.</p>
    <p>The Duke and Duchess of Sus­sex, who quit front-line royal du­ties in March cit­ing me­dia in­tru­sion, have de­nied be­ing in­volved in the pub­li­ca­tion of the book, Find­ing Free­dom.</p>
    <p>Harry, the grand­son of Bri­tain’s Queen El­iz­a­beth II and son of heir to the throne Prince Charles and the late Diana, Princess of Wales, has separately brought cases against two other Bri­tish tabloid pub­lish­ers for al­leged phone hack­ing.</p>
    <p>He and Markle live with their 17-month-old son Archie in the United States, where they have set up a char­i­ta­ble foun­da­tion.</p>
