    <p>In an arena show, there’s only so much you can do there to make sure the au­di­ence is get­ting ev­ery­thing, whereas when you have a cam­era fol­low you around all these crazy sets, the pos­si­bil­i­ties are re­ally end­less. POP SINGER DUA LIPA (left), on the dif­fer­ence be­tween hold­ing a live con­cert and an on­line gig</p>
    <p>It had seemed like 2020 would be another fan­tas­tic year for Bri­tish pop singer Dua Lipa.</p>
    <p>Fu­ture Nos­tal­gia, her sopho­more al­bum launched in March, be­came her first No. 1 al­bum in Bri­tain and went to the top in other coun­tries in­clud­ing Aus­tralia and New Zealand.</p>
    <p>Then the pan­demic put a stop to travel and live per­for­mances. A tour to pro­mote the al­bum, orig­i­nally sched­uled to take place across Europe in the mid­dle of the year, has now been post­poned to late next year.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the two-time Grammy win­ner is stag­ing an on­line con­cert on Satur­day for her global fans.</p>
    <p>“Un­for­tu­nately, it can’t be a live au­di­ence,” she says. “But I’m ex­cited be­cause life has felt some­what nor­mal, be­ing able to go into re­hearsals, be­ing able to dance with my dancers.”</p>
    <p>Dressed in a pink T-shirt and an over­sized colour­ful jacket, the singer was cheer­fully field­ing ques­tions from me­dia all across Asia in a re­cent Zoom press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>The 25-year-old, whose hit song Don’t Start Now won Favourite Song – Pop/Rock at the Amer­i­can Mu­sic Awards on Mon­day, is pulling out all the stops to make the show a mem­o­rable one for fans starved of her live gigs.</p>
    <p>It will be live-streamed from a ware­house in East Lon­don and will fea­ture sev­eral cus­tom-built sets that will repli­cate, among other things, a roller disco, a sur­real tele­vi­sion show set, a rave and a rocker’s hang­out.</p>
    <p>Do­ing the on­line gig is like hav­ing one’s own tele­vi­sion show and can be more flex­i­ble than do­ing live con­certs, she says.</p>
    <p>“In an arena show, there’s only so much you can do there to make sure the au­di­ence is get­ting ev­ery­thing, whereas when you have a cam­era fol­low you around all these crazy sets, the pos­si­bil­i­ties are re­ally end­less.”</p>
    <p>She has sev­eral guest stars lined up, from fel­low pop star Amer­i­can singer Mi­ley Cyrus to ac­claimed Bri­tish singer-song­writer FKA Twigs.</p>
    <p>Tak­ing in­spi­ra­tion from Fu­ture Nos­tal­gia’s songs, the vibe and aes­thet­ics of the con­cert are a mix­ture of retro and fu­tur­is­tic styles.</p>
    <p>Be­sides dancers, Lipa will also be ac­com­pa­nied by skaters, aeri­al­ists and ac­ro­bats.</p>
    <p>In the ab­sence of cheer­ing fans, the singer will be feed­ing off the en­ergy from her fel­low per­form­ers.</p>
    <p>“I want to bring that spec­ta­cle at home for ev­ery­one to en­joy and I want it to be filled with sur­prises and get peo­ple re­ally, re­ally ex­cited. Be­cause I think this idea of live-streaming the show is so new and so we’re all kind of fig­ur­ing it out as we go along,” says the singer, who re­leased her de­but sin­gle New Love in 2015.</p>
    <p>Lipa won three Brit Awards, in­clud­ing Bri­tish Break­through Act and Bri­tish Fe­male Solo Artist, in 2018. In the fol­low­ing year, she picked up Best New Artist and Best Dance Record­ing at the Grammy Awards.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic might have scup­pered her plans, but the singer is look­ing on the bright side.</p>
    <p>She has been able to spend a lot more time on re­hearsals in re­cent months, a lux­ury she never had be­cause of her packed sched­ule in the last few years.</p>
    <p>“It’s been five, six hours of just danc­ing and chore­og­ra­phy ev­ery day, mak­ing sure I’m able to dance and sing at the same time, try­ing to build up my stamina. Do­ing it, it’s like a boot camp.”</p>
