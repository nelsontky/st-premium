    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin said the Malaysian gov­ern­ment will not im­pose a to­tal lock­down de­spite the lat­est surge in Covid-19 cases, with a record 691 new cases re­ported yes­ter­day. It was the sec­ond con­sec­u­tive day with a record high num­ber.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin said he ex­pects a rise in the num­ber of Covid-19 cases in the coun­try in the short term, as a record 691 new cases were re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It was the sec­ond con­sec­u­tive day with a record high num­ber, af­ter 432 cases on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Four new deaths were re­ported, in­clud­ing that of a one-year-old, the coun­try’s first child fa­tal­ity.</p>
    <p>But Tan Sri Muhyid­din said the coun­try would not im­ple­ment an­other move­ment con­trol or­der (MCO) as it could badly af­fect the econ­omy, with 15 mil­lion Malaysians at work.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment will in­stead carry out tar­geted lock­downs, or Temco, of red zones which are ar­eas with 41 cases or more.</p>
    <p>Malaysia cur­rently has nine red zones – seven in Sabah, one in Kedah and one in Klang, Selangor.</p>
    <p>“We can­not be com­pla­cent. I ex­pect the num­ber of Covid-19 cases to rise in the short term. This is be­cause the Health Min­istry is test­ing more ag­gres­sively,” the Prime Min­is­ter said in a live tele­cast on na­tional tele­vi­sion and so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>“As of to­day, we are not think­ing of i mple­ment­ing a na­tion­wide move­ment con­trol or­der or a to­tal lock­down. If we i mple­ment an MCO again, this could lead to the col­lapse of the so­cial and eco­nomic sys­tem of the coun­try.”</p>
    <p>Malaysia im­ple­mented a lock­down from March 18, clos­ing its bor­ders, busi­nesses, and schools, but has grad­u­ally re­opened most sec­tors, start­ing in May. Bor­ders re­main closed ex­cept for re­turn­ing cit­i­zens and for ex­cep­tional cases.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din sought to re­as­sure Malaysians yes­ter­day that the coun­try was “now bet­ter pre­pared than be­fore in terms of ex­pe­ri­ence and man­power. We know the be­hav­iour of the virus bet­ter and we have enough fa­cil­i­ties and equip­ment”.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry’s di­rec­tor­gen­eral Noor Hisham Ab­dul­lah said that beds had been pre­pared for Covid-19 pa­tients, with 2,820 in hos­pi­tals and 3,975 in quar­an­tine cen­tres. At present, 36 per cent and 29 per cent of these are be­ing used, re­spec­tively, he said yes­ter­day. There are 1,505 ven­ti­la­tors avail­able with about 37 per cent be­ing used, in­clud­ing for non-Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Noor Hisham said Malaysia has 60 lab­o­ra­to­ries na­tion­wide con­duct­ing real-time re­verse-tran­scrip­tion poly­merase chain re­ac­tion tests, and is ca­pa­ble of carry-</p>
    <p>ing out 41,354 of these tests a day.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din also in­sisted there were “no dou­ble stan­dards” in quar­an­tine or­ders and that seven min­is­ters and six deputy min­is­ters were un­der­go­ing home quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>The Prime Min­is­ter and Dr Noor Hisham are them­selves in quar­an­tine, af­ter a min­is­te­rial meet­ing where de facto Is­lamic Af­fairs Min­is­ter Zulk­i­fli Mo­hamad al-Bakri, who tested pos­i­tive for the virus, was in at­ten­dance. Ninety of Datuk Seri Zulk­i­fli’s close con­tacts have so far tested neg­a­tive for the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Anger among Malaysians has been mount­ing over the new Covid-19 wave which they feel was spurred on by pol­i­tics, with re­ports of min­is­ters fail­ing to quar­an­tine af­ter their re­turn from Sabah for cam­paign­ing in the Sept 26 state elec­tion. Some of these min­is­ters did not ap­pear to have quar­an­tined them­selves upon re­turn­ing.</p>
    <p>Photos of ban­ners with swear words blam­ing politi­cians for the es­ca­lat­ing num­bers have been float­ing on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din de­fended the de­ci­sion to hold the Sabah state elec</p>
    <p>tion but con­ceded that it con­trib­uted to the grow­ing out­break as not ev­ery­one fol­lowed the safety mea­sures dur­ing cam­paign­ing.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment yes­ter­day an­nounced a travel ban from Sabah to other states, be­tween Oct 12 and 25, as num­bers in the state con­tin­ued to rise. Sabah recorded 219 cases.</p>
    <p>An­other state, Kedah, recorded a higher num­ber of daily cases than Sabah due to a Covid-19 out­break at a prison. Kedah re­ported 397 cases yes­ter­day.</p>
