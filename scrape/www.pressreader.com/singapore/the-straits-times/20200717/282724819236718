    <p>MON­TREAL • As the coro­n­avirus pan­demic ripped around the globe, Cirque du Soleil, a cir­cus troupe formed by Cana­dian street per­form­ers that be­came a global pow­er­house, saw most of its op­er­a­tions grind to a halt in barely 48 hours.</p>
    <p>The com­pany, which gained in­ter­na­tional renown for ex­trav­a­gant shows fea­tur­ing ac­ro­bats, jug­glers, fire breathers and mu­si­cians, was forced to shut down pro­duc­tions in China, Italy and the United States, among other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>This month, it filed for bank­ruptcy pro­tec­tion and is close to reach­ing a re­struc­tur­ing deal.</p>
    <p>“I never thought in my life that I would wake up one day and ba­si­cally in 48 hours, we end up with no shows, no rev­enues,” chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Daniel La­marre told Reuters.</p>
    <p>“It was very tough be­cause from hour to hour, I was learn­ing that one coun­try was shut down and then the other coun­try was shut down. ”</p>
    <p>Mr La­marre, who joined Cirque in 2001 as an ex­ec­u­tive scout­ing for new op­por­tu­ni­ties for its high-fly­ing acts, was left scram­bling to help per­form­ers get home from closed pro­duc­tions abroad and find ware­houses to store its 50 trucks of equip­ment per show.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pan­demic, the en­ter­tain­ment com­pany had 44 per­for­mances run­ning world­wide. They gen­er­ated about US$1 bil­lion (S$1.39 bil­lion) in an­nual rev­enues from shows that fea­tured un­der­wa­ter per­for­mances and oth­ers based on the late King of Pop Michael Jack­son, Ar­gen­tine foot­baller Lionel Messi and English rock band The Bea­tles.</p>
    <p>Show can­cel­la­tions led the com­pany to per­ma­nently or tem­po­rar­ily lay off 95 per cent of its work­ers.</p>
    <p>“My whole Face­book feed was just sad­ness,” said Mr Chris Gatti, a for­mer high-bar per­former and con­sul­tant for the com­pany.</p>
    <p>Pri­vately held Cirque de­clined to di­vulge ticket sales, but court doc­u­ments show the com­pany had nearly US$1.5 bil­lion in li­a­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic is the big­gest threat to face Cirque, which was cre­ated in the early 1980s as “The Stilt­walk­ers of Baie-Saint-Paul” in Que­bec, Canada.</p>
    <p>It be­came a global en­ter­tain­ment com­pany thanks to sold-out Las Ve­gas shows, tour­ing pro­duc­tions and ac­qui­si­tions.</p>
    <p>The shows, which have no an­i­mals or star per­form­ers, helped some key troupe mem­bers be­come wealthy. Mr Guy Lal­ib­erte, a per­former and co-founder of the com­pany, is on Forbes’ list of Cana­dian bil­lion­aires.</p>
    <p>While Cirque sees a po­ten­tial re­open­ing in the au­tumn for its res­i­dent pro­duc­tions in Las Ve­gas and Or­lando, Mr La­marre ex­pects the com­pany to get back to where it was in terms of the num­ber of shows, rev­enues and prof­its only in 2023.</p>
    <p>It is see­ing some green shoots of recovery with the re­open­ing of the Chi­nese pro­duc­tion The Land Of Fan­tasy last month, and an­other show open­ing in Mex­ico early this month.</p>
    <p>“We think that it will take a year to 18 months be­fore we’re back to nor­mal­ity, which means hav­ing a vac­cine or a cure that makes peo­ple feel safe in a theatre,” he said.</p>
    <p>“And then from there, we think that within a cou­ple of years, we’ll be able to bring back the com­pany where it was.”</p>
