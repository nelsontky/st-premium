        World | The Sunday Times Sunday, August 2, 2020 | A17 Mystery seeds sent to Americans may be part of ‘brushing’ scam • The US Department of Agricultur­e has identified more than a dozen plant species – ranging from morning glories to mustard – in bags of unsolicite­d seeds arriving in the mailboxes of thousands of Americans, mostly postmarked from China.
While most species identified seem to be innocuous herbs, flowering plants, vegetables or grasses, plant experts warn that seeds from other parts of the world could be non-native varieties that harm commodity crops.
Another concern is what appears to be an unknown coating – possibly insecticid­e or fungicide – on the seeds, said Ms Robin Pruisner, state seed control official at the Department of Agricultur­e and Land Stewardshi­p in Iowa, the top US corn-growing state.
Ms Pruisner said unknown seed treatments could damage crops.
“I’ve had people describe to me that the seeds are coated with something purple. I haven’t had it in my hands yet, but it sounds an awful lot like a seed treatment,” she said.
She said she had received 297 reports of seeds received as of last Thursday.
The US Department of Agricultur­e’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service is instructin­g state agencies to collect the seeds and send them to the agency for analysis. Last Wednesday, it said it had identified 14 different species of seeds but noted that it was still early in the process.
The department has said the packages are most likely part of a “brushing” scam, in which people receive unsolicite­d items from a seller who then posts false positive customer reviews to boost sales.
US Customs and Border Protection is investigat­ing the origin of the seeds. A spokesman for China’s Foreign Ministry has said the packages appear to have been falsified.
The packages have also been reported in Canada, where Ontario’s Central Region Provincial Police posted a warning on Facebook last Wednesday against “foreign seeds in the mail from China or Taiwan”.
In Britain, a spokesman for the Animal and Plant Health Agency said the agency was investigat­ing packages of seeds marked as “ear studs”.
The Florida Department of Agricultur­e and Consumer Services said it had received 1,209 reports about the seeds, with 300 phone calls last Thursday alone.
State agricultur­e department­s have also reported packages postmarked from Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, though most are reportedly from China.
Most of the American states are asking people to report the packages to the state agricultur­e department­s, which will then send inspectors to collect them.
Seed companies have seen global online and retail demand boom during the pandemic as consumers with time on their hands take up gardening.
But Ms Pruisner cautioned that online internatio­nal seed purchases could pose an ecological threat. “The ah-ha moment I really had here is how much seed people are buying from other countries,” she said. “I have been simply amazed, when I talk to people, how they say the other seed they’ve bought from China is fine.” CHICAGO REUTERS PRINTED AND DISTRIBUTE­D BY PRESSREADE­R PressReade­r.com +1 604 278 4604 ORIGINAL COPY .
