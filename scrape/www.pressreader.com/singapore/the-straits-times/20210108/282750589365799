    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Rap­per Kanye West and his re­al­ity TV star wife Kim Kar­dashian West are living sep­a­rately and un­der­go­ing mar­riage coun­selling, NBC News re­ported, cit­ing a source close to the fam­ily.</p>
    <p>For the past few months West, 43, has been living in Wy­oming while Kar­dashian West, 40, and their four chil­dren stayed in Cal­i­for­nia, the source said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The mega-celebrity cou­ple, who mar­ried in a lav­ish cer­e­mony in Italy in May 2014, have been re­peat­edly dogged by gos­sip-press spec­u­la­tion that their mar­riage is on the rocks.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple were go­ing through coun­selling deal­ing with “reg­u­lar re­la­tion­ship is­sues” and no one else was in­volved, the source said.</p>
    <p>“Kanye loves his ex­tended fam­ily. They are su­per close. They have been go­ing to ther­apy. They are work­ing on their mar­riage,” the source told NBC News.</p>
    <p>They had dis­cussed di­vorce, but Kar­dashian West had not filed for di­vorce.</p>
    <p>“They are work­ing through it... (and) try­ing to work through things,” the source said.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple magazine, Page Six and other celebrity gos­sip out­lets, how­ever, said Kar­dashian West was pre­par­ing to file for di­vorce.</p>
    <p>West has opened up about his strug­gles with bipo­lar dis­or­der.</p>
    <p>In July last year, the mer­cu­rial en­ter­tain­ment mogul launched a bid for the Unites States pres­i­dency with a ram­bling speech that saw him rant­ing in­co­her­ently, re­veal­ing he had wanted to abort his daugh­ter and break­ing down in tears.</p>
    <p>He also posted a se­ries of tweets, later deleted, that ac­cused his wife and mother-in-law of try­ing to lock him up and sug­gested he was seek­ing a di­vorce.</p>
    <p>Kar­dashian West called on the me­dia and public to show “com­pas­sion and em­pa­thy” fol­low­ing her hus­band’s er­ratic be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>“Those that un­der­stand men­tal ill­ness or even com­pul­sive be­hav­iour know that the fam­ily is pow­er­less un­less the mem­ber is a mi­nor,” she said in her lengthy In­sta­gram post in July.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple who are un­aware or far re­moved from this ex­pe­ri­ence can be judg­men­tal and not un­der­stand that the in­di­vid­ual them­selves have to en­gage in the process of get­ting help no mat­ter how hard fam­ily and friends try.”</p>
    <p>Kar­dashian West has a huge fol­low­ing on so­cial me­dia, but her hus­band has been ab­sent from her posts in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple have four chil­dren: seven-year-old daugh­ter North, son Saint, five, daugh­ter Chicago, two, and 19-month-old son Psalm.</p>
    <p>It is the first mar­riage for West and the third for Kar­dashian West, who came to fame with the US re­al­ity TV se­ries Keep­ing Up With The Kar­dashi­ans (2007 to present) which fol­lowed the lives of her fam­ily in Los An­ge­les.</p>
