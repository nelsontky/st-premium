    <p>LON­DON • Seven-time For­mula One world cham­pion Lewis Hamil­ton was awarded a knight­hood in the United King­dom New Year’s honours list pub­lished on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old in Novem­ber be­came the most suc­cess­ful F1 driver af­ter equalling Fer­rari great Michael Schu­macher’s record seven ti­tles and beat­ing the Ger­man’s 91 race wins the month be­fore. The sport’s only black driver, who grew up in so­cial hous­ing as the grand­son of im­mi­grants from the Caribbean, Hamil­ton has also used his pro­file to cam­paign for di­ver­sity and speak out against racial in­jus­tice.</p>
    <p>The Monaco res­i­dent’s pres­ence on the over­seas and in­ter­na­tional list, rather than the main one with many re­warded for ser­vice to pub­lic health dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, was seen as a re­flec­tion of his tax sta­tus.</p>
    <p>The Daily Mail said Prime Min­is­ter Boris Johnson had “bent the rules” to get around the tax re­quire­ments for do­mes­tic awards.</p>
    <p>The ci­ta­tion re­ferred to Hamil­ton’s sport­ing record and his “char­i­ta­ble and phil­an­thropic con­tri­bu­tions in the UK and over­seas”.</p>
    <p>His sup­port­ers have long felt his achieve­ments have not been suf­fi­ciently recog­nised at home and they ex­pressed de­light at the Mercedes driver join­ing a se­lect group of sport­ing sirs.</p>
    <p>“Lewis is a true gi­ant of our sport and his in­flu­ence is huge both in and out of a car,” said newly-ap­pointed F1 chief ex­ec­u­tive Ste­fano Domeni­cali, a former Fer­rari team prin­ci­pal. “What he has achieved is phe­nom­e­nal with still more to come.”</p>
    <p>Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff hailed his star driver, who won his first ti­tle with McLaren in 2008, as the most suc­cess­ful Bri­tish sports­man of his era.</p>
    <p>The knight­hood, he added, showed Hamil­ton – of­ten seen as a po­lar­is­ing fig­ure – was “now receiving the recog­ni­tion he has earned dur­ing a ca­reer of un­par­al­leled suc­cess in mo­tor­sport”.</p>
    <p>“The UK can be very proud to have a cham­pion and am­bas­sador of the cal­i­bre of Sir Lewis Hamil­ton,” added the Aus­trian.</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton is the fourth F1 driver to be knighted af­ter Aus­tralian Jack Brab­ham, Stir­ling Moss and three-time cham­pion Jackie Ste­wart, and the only one to have re­ceived the award while still rac­ing.</p>
    <p>Cy­cling’s Tour de France win­ner Bradley Wig­gins, Olympic 5,000m and 10,000m cham­pion Mo Farah, three-time Grand Slam win­ner Andy Mur­ray and crick­eter Alas­tair Cook have also been knighted as ac­tive sports­men.</p>
