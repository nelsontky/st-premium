    <p>Big­ger than EU and Nafta</p>
    <p>Cielito Habito</p>
    <p>Philip­pine Daily In­quirer, the Philip­pines</p>
    <p>Some­thing mo­men­tous hap­pened over the last week­end that sig­nals the con­tin­u­ing shift of the world’s eco­nomic ful­crum to Asia-Pa­cific away from North Amer­ica. Fif­teen economies, com­pris­ing about a third of the world’s pop­u­la­tion, signed a trade agree­ment that for­malises what is now the world’s largest trad­ing bloc.</p>
    <p>Ini­ti­ated by the 10 Asean economies, the newly minted Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship, or RCEP, now brings in five of the six “di­a­logue part­ners” with which Asean has al­ready had sep­a­rate free trade deals: Aus­tralia, China, Ja­pan, New Zealand and South Korea.</p>
    <p>In­dia, the sixth di­a­logue part­ner, was orig­i­nally part of the group, but chose to with­draw late last year on fears of an on­slaught of dumped goods from China, among other con­cerns. Even with­out In­dia, RCEP is now big­ger than the Euro­pean Union, and the North Amer­i­can Free Trade Agree­ment com­posed of Canada, the United States and Mex­ico.</p>
    <p>The for­mal sign­ing of the RCEP agree­ment is seen as a “vic­tory” for China over the United States, as it cer­tainly gains an ad­van­tage over the lat­ter in their on­go­ing trade war.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause China, by its sheer size, in­evitably dom­i­nates the new trade group, and with for­mal­i­sa­tion of the agree­ment, can as­sert that it has al­ter­na­tives to the US mar­ket; and it gains the up­per hand over the lat­ter in in­flu­enc­ing fu­ture eco­nomic di­rec­tions in Asia-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>It was the sec­ond con­cern that had prompted for­mer US pres­i­dent Barack Obama to cham­pion the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship (TPP) agree­ment as a key part of his ad­min­is­tra­tion’s “pivot to Asia”.</p>
    <p>The TPP was then seen as a ri­val to RCEP, as even as it has a much smaller com­bined pop­u­la­tion and con­sumer base, it would have also ac­counted for 40 per cent of the world’s in­comes. But US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump chose to pull out of TPP in one of his ear­li­est moves as pres­i­dent, thereby emas­cu­lat­ing that group­ing. Still, the rest pro­ceeded on a much-down­graded scale and sig­nif­i­cance, as the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship, which they signed in 2018.</p>
    <p>Where does our coun­try stand in all this? Trade Sec­re­tary Ra­mon Lopez points out that the RCEP economies ac­counted last year for half of Philip­pine ex­ports, 61 per cent of our im­ports, and 11.4 per cent of for­eign di­rect in­vest­ments. The agree­ment is thus of crit­i­cal im­por­tance to us.</p>
    <p>Ba­sis for global free trade</p>
    <p>Ed­i­to­rial</p>
    <p>The Yomi­uri Shim­bun, Ja­pan</p>
    <p>A huge trad­ing bloc will be cre­ated. It is hoped that the new trad­ing bloc will be used as a ba­sis for de­vel­op­ing the global free trade sys­tem. The RCEP is the first free trade agree­ment that Ja­pan has signed with China, its largest trad­ing part­ner, and South Korea, its third-largest trad­ing part­ner.</p>
    <p>This large-scale agree­ment comes af­ter the TPP mul­ti­lat­eral free trade pact and the eco­nomic part­ner­ship agree­ment with the Euro­pean Union. It is com­mend­able that an agree­ment on the RCEP has been reached. Ex­pan­sion of trade and in­vest­ment and in­creased ef­fi­ciency of sup­ply chains are ex­pected. It is de­sir­able to use the RCEP to vi­talise the stag­nant Ja­panese econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Un­der the ac­cord, Ja­pan is ex­pected to ben­e­fit most from tar­iffs on auto parts. Tar­iffs on about 90 per cent of auto parts ex­ported from Ja­pan to China, such as bat­tery ma­te­ri­als for elec­tric ve­hi­cles, are likely to grad­u­ally drop to zero.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the level of lib­er­al­i­sa­tion is low com­pared with the TPP.</p>
    <p>Deal to aid re­cov­ery af­ter pan­demic</p>
    <p>Ed­i­to­rial</p>
    <p>China Daily, China</p>
    <p>The sign­ing of the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship of­fers a badly needed boost to re­gional eco­nomic con­fi­dence, and may serve as a cru­cial first step to­wards the re­draw­ing of the global eco­nomic map over time.</p>
    <p>Although it does not go as far as the Euro­pean Union in in­te­grat­ing mem­ber economies, a free trade deal of such a scale will pro­vide enor­mous mo­men­tum to re­gional trade – not to men­tion the hopes it em­bod­ies for coun­ter­ing pro­tec­tion­ism, boost­ing in­vest­ment, open­ing up the trade in ser­vices and al­low­ing freer move­ment of goods within the re­gion.</p>
    <p>The deal may, in turn, pro­vide sub­stan­tial as­sis­tance to the post-pan­demic re­cov­ery of the sig­na­tory economies.</p>
    <p>The heavy blow dealt to re­gional economies by the coro­n­avirus added to the sig­na­to­ries’ sense of ur­gency and fa­cil­i­tated the ul­ti­mate sign­ing of the agree­ment.</p>
    <p>But the par­ties to the agree­ment should be aware that any at­tempt to add geopo­lit­i­cal bag­gage to the essen­tially eco­nomic group­ing will only end up dis­rupt­ing its func­tion­ing.</p>
    <p>South Korea set to ben­e­fit greatly</p>
    <p>Ed­i­to­rial</p>
    <p>The Korea Her­ald, South Korea</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mists pre­dict that the deal, the first trade ac­cord bring­ing to­gether China, Ja­pan and South Korea, could add al­most US$200 bil­lion (S$269 bil­lion) an­nu­ally to the global econ­omy by 2030.</p>
    <p>South Korea is set to be among the great­est ben­e­fi­cia­ries from the RCEP agree­ment, which marks the first step to­wards Asia’s in­te­gra­tion into a co­her­ent trad­ing zone.</p>
    <p>A lo­cal re­search in­sti­tute re­cently fore­cast the coun­try’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct would grow by 0.41 to 0.51 per­cent­age point ad­di­tion­ally over a decade af­ter the ac­cord comes into force.</p>
    <p>But the RCEP launch could put South Korea in a fur­ther awk­ward po­si­tion amid an in­ten­si­fy­ing ri­valry be­tween the United States and China. me­dia part­ner Asia News Network, a group­ing of 24 news me­dia ti­tles.</p>
