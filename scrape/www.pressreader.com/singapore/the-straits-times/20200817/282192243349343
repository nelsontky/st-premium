    <p>The Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) re­cently in­structed lo­cal banks and fi­nance com­pa­nies to cap their to­tal div­i­dends per share for the 2020 fi­nan­cial year at 60 per cent of to­tal div­i­dends paid last year, and of­fer in­vestors the op­tion of re­ceiv­ing pay­outs in shares, not cash.</p>
    <p>The move led to some raised eye­brows, pri­mar­ily be­cause the reg­u­la­tor has never be­fore in­ter­fered in dividend poli­cies, which are usu­ally left to the dis­cre­tion of di­rec­tors.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, a let­ter in The Straits Times on Aug 10 ar­gued that many in­vestors rely on div­i­dends to help pay loans and mort­gages.</p>
    <p>In­deed, it is likely that in­vestors who rely on div­i­dends as an im­por­tant source of pas­sive in­come would be the most un­happy with the move, es­pe­cially with pay­outs by most real es­tate in­vest­ment trusts, or Reits, al­ready hav­ing been se­verely cut be­cause of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>More­over, some might ar­gue that Sin­ga­pore banks are well-cap­i­talised and have suf­fi­cient re­serves to with­stand most shocks – in fact, the MAS said as much in its July 29 state­ment.</p>
    <p>“MAS stress tests have shown that the lo­cal banks re­main re­silient even un­der ad­verse con­di­tions con­sis­tent with a se­ri­ous and pro­longed pub­lic health cri­sis,” it said.</p>
    <p>The most com­mon ra­tio to as­sess a bank’s fi­nan­cial strength is the Com­mon Equity Tier 1 (CET1), which mea­sures CET1 cap­i­tal against risk-weighted as­sets. The ra­tio was adopted after the 2008 fi­nan­cial cri­sis with a min­i­mum re­quire­ment ra­tio of 4.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>Since the ra­tio mea­sures a bank’s cov­er­age of its risky as­sets, the higher the num­ber, the stronger its fi­nances.</p>
    <p>Al­though the MAS re­quires that banks here have a min­i­mum CET1 ra­tio of 6.5 per cent, the ra­tios of</p>
    <p>DBS Bank, OCBC Bank and United Overseas Bank have been es­ti­mated to be at least twice this fig­ure, which, to be­gin with, is higher than the global re­quire­ment.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics of the reg­u­la­tor’s move ar­gue that since Sin­ga­pore banks are so much stronger than what reg­u­la­tions re­quire, then surely it might be bet­ter to just leave in­di­vid­ual banks to de­cide on how much they want to pay share­hold­ers?</p>
    <p>While this is a valid ques­tion and while share­hold­ers, par­tic­u­larly re­tirees, who rely on div­i­dends to sup­ple­ment their in­comes, can jus­ti­fi­ably feel up­set at the prospect of re­duced pay­outs, there are valid rea­sons for the MAS’ move.</p>
    <p>IN SYNC WITH GLOBAL MOVES</p>
    <p>Be­fore go­ing fur­ther, it is worth bear­ing in mind that banks and fi­nance com­pa­nies are re­quired to com­ply with the rules and reg­u­la­tions is­sued by the MAS.</p>
    <p>In other words, in­vestors must be cog­nisant of po­ten­tial reg­u­la­tory changes or su­per­vi­sory di­rec­tions when buy­ing shares in fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>How­ever, reg­u­la­tory risk does not usu­ally sur­face as a ma­jor fac­tor in nor­mal cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>First is that it is in line with sim­i­lar moves across the world and, as a key fi­nan­cial cen­tre, Sin­ga­pore is not out of sync with prac­tices set by other ma­jor cen­tral banks.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Cen­tral Bank, for ex­am­ple, on July 28 asked banks un­der its su­per­vi­sion not to pay div­i­dends or per­form any share buy­backs un­til Jan­uary next year.</p>
    <p>It said the in­struc­tion “is aimed at pre­serv­ing banks’ ca­pac­ity to ab­sorb losses and sup­port the econ­omy in this en­vi­ron­ment of ex­cep­tional un­cer­tainty”, adding that the un­cer­tainty makes it dif­fi­cult for banks to ac­cu­rately forecast their cap­i­tal po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>In April, the Re­serve Bank of New Zealand or­dered banks to stop pay­ing div­i­dends or re­deem­ing cap­i­tal notes, say­ing the or­der “sup­ports the sta­bil­ity of the fi­nan­cial sys­tem by main­tain­ing higher lev­els of cap­i­tal dur­ing the pe­riod of fall­ing eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity re­sult­ing from the Covid-19 pan­demic”.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian Pru­den­tial Reg­u­la­tion Au­thor­ity (Apra) said in April that it ex­pected “pru­dent re­duc­tions in div­i­dends” paid by banks dur­ing the cri­sis. Last month, it up­dated this to say banks “do not need to con­tinue to de­fer cap­i­tal dis­tri­bu­tions, pro­vided they mod­er­ate pay­ments to sus­tain­able lev­els based on ro­bust stress test­ing and con­tinue to pri­ori­tise sup­port­ing cus­tomers and the econ­omy”.</p>
    <p>Apra said dividend pay­out ra­tios for banks should be be­low 50 per cent for this year.</p>
    <p>The Bank of Eng­land’s Pru­den­tial Reg­u­la­tion Au­thor­ity in April urged the coun­try’s com­mer­cial banks to pre­serve cap­i­tal to help the econ­omy and not pay div­i­dends.</p>
    <p>“Al­though the de­ci­sions taken to­day will re­sult in share­hold­ers not re­ceiv­ing div­i­dends, they are a sen­si­ble pre­cau­tion­ary step given the... eco­nomic dis­rup­tion,” it said.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond and more im­por­tant, al­though more ex­am­ples from around the world can be pre­sented, the mes­sage should al­ready be clear from the com­mon thread: The dev­as­ta­tion wreaked by Covid-19 is ex­ten­sive and could have mas­sive con­se­quences on the fi­nan­cial sys­tem and the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Seen in this light, the MAS</p>
    <p>Be­cause the three Sin­ga­pore banks are well-cap­i­talised and well-man­aged, their long-term out­look re­mains pos­i­tive... Share­hold­ers may there­fore wish to con­sider the scrip dividend op­tion in­stead of cash for this year. For those pre­pared to hold their in­vest­ments for many years, re­ceiv­ing more shares to­day could mean more cap­i­tal gains to­mor­row, which could make up for div­i­dends sac­ri­ficed in the in­terim.</p>
    <p>in­struc­tion is a pre-emp­tive, pru­dent move to en­sure that the vi­tal bank­ing sec­tor re­mains re­silient and re­tains its ca­pac­ity to sup­port lend­ing to busi­nesses and in­di­vid­u­als dur­ing a mas­sive cri­sis of un­known ten­ure.</p>
    <p>It is also rel­e­vant to note that the MAS is pay­ing close at­ten­tion to what could hap­pen at the end of the year when re­lief mea­sures in­tro­duced to ease the bur­den on house­holds and busi­nesses ex­pire.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, home mort­gage bor­row­ers can de­fer re­pay­ments un­til De­cem­ber, which lifts pres­sure on their im­me­di­ate cash flow.</p>
    <p>How­ever, if the sit­u­a­tion does not im­prove by then – and there is lit­tle rea­son to think it will – what would be the im­pact on banks if those who opt for this de­fer­ment are un­able to re­sume their re­pay­ments?</p>
    <p>MAS man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Ravi Menon said last month that the reg­u­la­tor is look­ing at ways to ease bor­row­ers into re­sum­ing pay­ments be­cause re­lief can­not con­tinue for­ever.</p>
    <p>The re­sults of its study are due in Oc­to­ber and should pro­vide some clues on what lies ahead for banks.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, be­cause the three Sin­ga­pore banks are well-cap­i­talised and well-man­aged, their long-term out­look re­mains pos­i­tive, but they should en­gage stake­hold­ers dur­ing this dif­fi­cult pe­riod to main­tain in­vestor con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>Share­hold­ers may there­fore wish to con­sider the scrip dividend op­tion in­stead of cash for this year.</p>
    <p>For those pre­pared to hold their in­vest­ments for many years, re­ceiv­ing more shares to­day could mean more cap­i­tal gains to­mor­row, which could make up for div­i­dends sac­ri­ficed in the in­terim.</p>
