    <p>CON­VE­NIENT CHECK-UP</p>
    <p>A pi­lot scheme to pro­vide free health screen­ing ser­vices – us­ing the lat­est tech­nolo­gies – for Sin­ga­pore­ans aged above 50 is now un­der way at Pung­gol 21 Com­mu­nity Club.</p>
    <p>Up to 1,000 res­i­dents can regis­ter on­line to visit a telemedici­ne booth at the com­mu­nity club, where they will be checked for eye and car­dio­vas­cu­lar diseases, as well as other con­di­tions like di­a­betes and obe­sity.</p>
    <p>At the booth manned by vol­un­teers, res­i­dents can track vi­tal signs such as their blood pres­sure, body mass in­dex and blood glu­cose level.</p>
    <p>An eye ma­chine will cap­ture reti</p>
    <p>nal im­ages, which will be pro­cessed by an ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence sys­tem. The re­sults will also be sent to the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Eye Cen­tre for as­sess­ment by specialist­s.</p>
    <p>The en­tire screen­ing process takes up to 20 min­utes, and res­i­dents can re­ceive their health re­ports on the spot.</p>
    <p>The booth, which will be up un­til Feb 28, is part of a ground-up ini­tia­tive called Com­mu­nity Tele­health Ser­vice, which was started by a group of nine grad­u­ate stu­dents from Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity (NTU).</p>
    <p>The leader of the pro­ject, Dr Michelle Law, 31, a med­i­cal doc­tor who is now a PhD stu­dent at NTU’s Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, said they started it after wit­ness­ing how the coro­n­avirus pan­demic had de­layed many health</p>
    <p>screen­ings for the el­derly and peo­ple at risk of health problems.</p>
    <p>Mr Alvin Chew, 28, one of the pro­ject’s co-founders, said the health screen­ing can­not re­place a doc­tor’s di­ag­no­sis, and the team will re­fer users to a poly­clinic or a hos­pi­tal for fol­low-ups if any ab­nor­mal­i­ties are ob­served.</p>
    <p>He added that he hopes the booth can im­prove the health lit­er­acy of the com­mu­nity, as it al­lows res­i­dents to eas­ily ac­cess health screen­ing ser­vices.</p>
    <p>“Res­i­dents can just pop by and check their health sta­tus while on their way to the mar­ket,” said Mr Chew, a PhD stu­dent in NTU’s In­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary Grad­u­ate Pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>“This is much more con­ve­nient com­pared with them hav­ing to take a huge chunk of time out to go</p>
    <p>to a clinic or poly­clinic.”</p>
    <p>Re­sponse to the scheme has been very en­cour­ag­ing, he said, not­ing that all slots in the first two weeks have been booked.</p>
    <p>The scheme is funded with a Young ChangeMak­ers grant from the Na­tional Youth Coun­cil and an­other grant from os­car@sg by Te­masek Trust.</p>
    <p>It is also sup­ported by NTU’s Grad­u­ate Col­lege.</p>
    <p>Mr Chew said the team is in dis­cus­sion with other com­mu­nity part­ners, and hopes to ex­pand the scheme to other com­mu­nity cen­tres soon.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents who are in­ter­ested can regis­ter for the tele­health screen­ings at blogs.ntu.edu.sg/ com­mu­ni­tytele­health­ser­vice/</p>
