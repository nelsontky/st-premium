    <p>Natasha Faisal takes a look at her mo­bile phone’s photo al­bum and ex­claims: “It’s all Luna, all 40,000 of them.”</p>
    <p>The 987FM DJ is clearly in­fat­u­ated with her first baby, Luna Iq­mal, who was born on June 11 last year, and em­braces motherhood.</p>
    <p>From wak­ing up late to be­com­ing a morn­ing per­son, Natasha, 25, is amazed by how much she has changed.</p>
    <p>“It’s em­bar­rass­ing, but my mum can at­test to how I needed her help get­ting up be­cause, most times, the alarm was not re­li­able at all,” she says.</p>
    <p>“But since be­com­ing a mother, I ac­tu­ally enjoy pre­par­ing break­fast.</p>
    <p>“The slight­est move­ment or a lit­tle sneeze from my baby can wake me up and I of­ten start my day as early as 5am.”</p>
    <p>She can­not wait to ex­plore recipes and start cook­ing for Luna, who has re­cently started on solid food.</p>
    <p>“I love be­ing in the kitchen and pre­par­ing meals. I can only hope that she turns out to be a big foodie like her par­ents,” says Natasha, who is mar­ried to Iq­mal Ju­maat, 30, a busi­ness man­ager.</p>
    <p>For now, she is re­mind­ing her­self to go easy on tak­ing videos and pho­tos of Luna.</p>
    <p>“Like se­ri­ously, I don’t need 500 pho­tos of her sleep­ing with her mouth open,” she says with a laugh.</p>
    <p>“But on a more se­ri­ous note, I would love to over­come my re­luc­tance to ask for help and also to feel less mum-guilt. I hope to re­claim my­self so that I can be the best ver­sion of me for my fam­ily,” she adds.</p>
