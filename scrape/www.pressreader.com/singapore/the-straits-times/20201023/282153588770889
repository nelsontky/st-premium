    <p>In­done­sia is set to be­come a bat­tle­ground for elec­tric ve­hi­cle (EV) bat­tery pro­duc­tion as two global gi­ants, China’s CATL and South Korea’s LG Chem, are in­vest­ing bil­lions of dol­lars in sup­ply chains, tap­ping the abun­dant re­serves of nickel, a key raw ma­te­rial, in the re­source-rich South-east Asian na­tion.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia holds about a quar­ter of the global re­serves of nickel, the Philip­pines about a twen­ti­eth, while the rest of the world has the re­main­ing share.</p>
    <p>CATL and LG Chem have sep­a­rate joint-ven­ture agree­ments with In­done­sian state-con­trolled miner Aneka Tam­bang (An­tam) to con­duct ac­tiv­i­ties in nickel min­ing and pro­cess­ing, and other raw ma­te­rial pro­cess­ing to make lithium bat­ter­ies, spokesman Jodi Ma­hardi for the Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­istry for Maritime Af­fairs and In­vest­ment (Marves) told The Straits Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment has been try­ing to en­cour­age the set­ting up of an end-to-end EV in­dus­try in the coun­try. In 2015, it started the constructi­on of a nickel in­dus­trial park on 2,000ha of land in Cen­tral Su­lawesi prov­ince that has today be­come the world’s largest, pro­duc­ing mil­lions of tonnes of stain­less steel slabs. Nickel is also used to make steel.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary last year, the coun­try started the constructi­on of a plant to pro­duce bat­tery-grade nickel chem­i­cals for elec­tric car bat­ter­ies, and planned to have it op­er­a­tional this year.</p>
    <p>CATL, which will work with Chi­nese min­ing in­vest­ment com­pany Ningbo Ly­gend and An­tam, has com­mit­ted to spend­ing about US$5 bil­lion (S$6.8 bil­lion) by 2023, and US$15 bil­lion more through 2028.</p>
    <p>Ningbo Ly­gend has the high-pres­sure acid leach­ing tech­nol­ogy that could turn even lower-qual­ity nickel ore into bat­tery-grade chem­i­cals. Pre­vi­ously, only high-grade nickel ore could be pro­cessed to make EV bat­ter­ies.</p>
    <p>CATL’s close ri­val LG Chem will also work with An­tam on a sim­i­lar en­deav­our. The Straits Times un­der­stands that talks are more ad­vanced with CATL.</p>
    <p>CATL, the world’s largest pro­ducer of lithium-ion bat­ter­ies, shipped 40.7 gi­gawatt hours (GWh) last year, fol­lowed by the sec­ond-largest maker Pana­sonic with 30.7GWh and LG Chem with 13.3GWh, ac­cord­ing to Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>CATL has re­cently se­cured a deal to sup­ply bat­tery packs to Tesla, which in the mid­dle of this year over­took Toy­ota to be­come the world’s most valu­able car­maker. Pana­sonic was pre­vi­ously the long­time sup­plier of Tesla.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia ex­pects to see the first pro­duc­tion of bat­tery packs by 2028, Mr Sep­tian Hario Seto, a deputy min­is­ter at Marves who is in charge of min­ing and in­vest­ment, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>He said that for the pro­duc­tion of bat­tery cells and bat­tery packs, in­vestors would be asked to build their plants near the au­to­mo­tive in­dus­try base, which is in the coun­try’s most pop­u­lous is­land of Java. Ac­tiv­i­ties for the rest of the sup­ply chains, in­clud­ing nickel ore min­ing, could re­main near the min­ing sites. The nickel ore re­serves are lo­cated in South-east Su­lawesi’s Ko­laka, Po­mala and Kon­awe; Sorowako-Ba­hodopi (on the border of South and Cen­tral Su­lawesi prov­inces); Buli in North Maluku; and Gag is­land in West Pa­pua prov­ince.</p>
    <p>“We will ask them to build their plants in Batang, Cen­tral Java, so they are near the ex­ist­ing au­to­mo­bile (pro­duc­tion fa­cil­i­ties),” Mr Seto said. In­done­sia’s West Java and Cen­tral Java prov­inces boast var­i­ous au­to­mo­tive in­dus­tries rang­ing from mi­nor spare parts to full assem­bly and pro­duc­tion of cars and trucks.</p>
    <p>Mr Jodi said the govern­ment is also draft­ing reg­u­la­tions to ad­dress bat­tery end-of-life is­sues and pave the way for the constructi­on of the coun­try’s first bat­tery re­cy­cling plant.</p>
    <p>He added that dur­ing a trip to Yun­nan, China, ear­lier this month, CATL told Co­or­di­nat­ing Maritime Af­fairs and In­vest­ment Min­is­ter Luhut Pand­jai­tan that it was keen to ask its busi­ness part­ners, in­clud­ing Tesla, to also in­vest in In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment had ear­lier said it was in early dis­cus­sions with Tesla for a pos­si­ble in­vest­ment here. Late last year, Hyundai Mo­tor an­nounced a US$1.55 bil­lion in­vest­ment plan to de­velop EVs in In­done­sia.</p>
