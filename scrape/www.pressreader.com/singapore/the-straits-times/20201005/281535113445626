    <p>In­done­sian Pres­i­dent Joko Widodo de­fended his record of fight­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, ask­ing for no “polemics” or “com­mo­tion” amid crit­i­cism that he is putting the coun­try’s econ­omy over pub­lic health.</p>
    <p>JAKARTA • In­done­sian Pres­i­dent Joko Widodo de­fended his record of fight­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, ask­ing for no “polemics” or “com­mo­tion” amid crit­i­cism that he is putting the coun­try’s econ­omy over pub­lic health.</p>
    <p>The video state­ment late on Satur­day came as the world’s fourth­most pop­u­lous coun­try’s Covid-19 caseload rose to 299,506.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the coun­try added an­other 3,992 new cases, the low­est daily in­crease in six days, tak­ing its to­tal num­ber of in­fec­tions to 303,498, health min­istry data showed. Coro­n­avirus-re­lated death toll rose by 96 to 11,151, among the high­est in Asia.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment’s han­dling of the pan­demic since March has drawn crit­i­cism from some pub­lic health ex­perts for pri­ori­tis­ing eco­nomic over pub­lic health con­cerns.</p>
    <p>The health min­istry has re­cently come un­der heavy crit­i­cism from vol­un­teer groups and more gen­er­ally on so­cial me­dia for what they say is in­suf­fi­cient spend­ing on the pan­demic, in­suf­fi­cient pro­tec­tion for health work­ers and high prices for pri­vate coro­n­avirus tests.</p>
    <p>“I can say that the Covid han­dling in In­done­sia has not been bad, in­deed it has been quite good,” the Pres­i­dent said in the state­ment on his of­fi­cial YouTube ac­count, ar­gu­ing that the coun­try’s to­tal cases and death toll are lower than coun­tries with com­pa­ra­bly large pop­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent, known by his pop­u­lar name Jokowi, de­fended his de­ci­sion not to im­pose prov­ince- or city-wide lock­downs in places where cases con­tinue to surge be­cause he said that would have hurt peo­ple’s liveli­hood.</p>
    <p>“Pri­ori­tis­ing health mat­ters does not mean we are sac­ri­fic­ing the econ­omy, be­cause sac­ri­fic­ing the econ­omy is equal to sac­ri­fic­ing the lives of tens of mil­lions of peo­ple,” Mr Joko said.</p>
    <p>“Over­com­ing the pan­demic is dif­fi­cult, it re­quires hard work to­gether, but I’m sure we can do it,” he said. “The most im­por­tant thing in this sit­u­a­tion is we should not make polemics and there should be no com­mo­tion.”</p>
    <p>South-east Asia’s big­gest econ­omy is set to en­ter its first re­ces­sion since the 1998 Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis this year due to the pan­demic. But the gov­ern­ment’s worst-case forecast of a 1.7 per cent con­trac­tion this year is bet­ter than many economies, of­fi­cials say.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent also pledged to or­der his min­is­ters to im­prove their re­sponse to the cri­sis and urged peo­ple to com­plain or pro­vide sug­ges­tions to the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the gov­ern­ment has set the price ceil­ing for in­di­vid­u­ally re­quested Covid-19 swab tests at 900,000 ru­piah (S$83), af­ter the na­tional Covid-19 task force said sev­eral hos­pi­tals had charged high fees of over 2.5 mil­lion ru­piah.</p>
