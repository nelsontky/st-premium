    <p>When mem­bers of the In­ter­na­tional Crim­i­nal Court (ICC) trav­elled to Khar­toum last month, they ne­go­ti­ated a pos­si­ble ex­tra­di­tion of for­mer Su­danese pres­i­dent Omar al-Bashir to the seat of the ICC in The Hague.</p>
    <p>If al-Bashir at some point stands trial in the Nether­lands, he will be charged with crimes against hu­man­ity – around 300,000 peo­ple died in an act of geno­cide in Dar­fur in 2003.</p>
    <p>A trial of al-Bashir would not have been pos­si­ble with­out the prece­dent set by the Nurem­berg tri­als 75 years ago.</p>
    <p>In the au­tumn of 1945, 21 mem­bers of the for­mer Ger­man Nazi lead­er­ship faced sim­i­lar charges of crimes against hu­man­ity.</p>
    <p>The legacy of Nurem­berg is far-reach­ing and can be felt to this day. The so-called “Nurem­berg prin­ci­ples” have be­come an in­te­gral part of in­ter­na­tional law.</p>
    <p>One of these prin­ci­ples states that a per­son can be held ac­count­able for a crime that is not pun­ish­able un­der na­tional law but is so un­der in­ter­na­tional law.</p>
    <p>The goal is to make sure that crim­i­nals do not es­cape their just pun­ish­ment only be­cause of ju­di­cial loop­holes in their re­spec­tive coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The con­cept of the re­spon­si­bil­ity to pro­tect is also recog­nised by the UN as part of in­ter­na­tional law. It al­lows the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity of states to in­ter­vene mil­i­tar­ily when se­ri­ous hu­man rights vi­o­la­tions oc­cur.</p>
    <p>If al-Bashir is tried in The Hague, he would not be the first to be charged un­der in­ter­na­tional law.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the ICC came into oper­a­tion on July 1, 2002 – the Rome Statute, the le­gal ba­sis for the ICC, was adopted in July 1998 – the United Na­tions es­tab­lished two ad hoc tri­bunals in the early 1990s deal­ing with atroc­i­ties in the for­mer Yu­goslavia and in Rwanda.</p>
    <p>MILO­SE­VIC AND KH­MER ROUGE</p>
    <p>One of the most prom­i­nent de­fen­dants was Slo­bo­dan Milo­se­vic, the for­mer pres­i­dent of Ser­bia, who was in­dicted for mass killings in Kosovo and also charged with crimes against hu­man­ity.</p>
    <p>Although he died in 2006, be­fore the end of the trial, he stands as a sym­bol of how Nurem­berg changed in­ter­na­tional law.</p>
    <p>In 2006, when the Kh­mer Rouge tri­bunal be­gan to bring to jus­tice those in the for­mer Kh­mer Rouge regime who were re­spon­si­ble for mass killings in Cam­bo­dia in the 1970s, the in­spi­ra­tion also came from the Nurem­berg tri­als.</p>
    <p>Although the tri­als were held many years after the crimes, po­lit­i­cal strong­men such as Khieu Sam­phan and Ieng Sary were in­dicted for geno­cide and crimes against hu­man­ity.</p>
    <p>Ieng Sary died dur­ing the trial in 2013, but Khieu Sam­phan is serv­ing a life sen­tence in Ph­nom Penh. The court de­clared him re­spon­si­ble for, among other things, mur­der, ex­ter­mi­na­tion, en­slave­ment and de­por­ta­tion – the same charges brought against the Nazi lead­ers in the Nurem­berg tri­als.</p>
    <p>But un­like the sit­u­a­tion to­day, the ac­tion against the Nazis 75 years ago was un­charted ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Mil­i­tary Tri­bunal of Nurem­berg not only cre­ated new crim­i­nal of­fences, but also al­lowed the new laws to be ap­plied retroac­tively. This con­tra­dicted the then pre­vail­ing le­gal opin­ion, but the im­mea­sur­able suf­fer­ing in­flicted un­der Ger­man oc­cu­pa­tion in</p>
    <p>Europe was cry­ing out for crim­i­nal pros­e­cu­tion.</p>
    <p>Although dic­ta­tor Adolf Hitler, pro­pa­ganda min­is­ter Joseph Goebbels and Schutzstaf­fel (SS) head Hein­rich Himm­ler were all dead, many of their hench­men were still alive, and the trial of the cen­tury kicked off on Nov 20, 1945.</p>
    <p>The footage of the 21 de­fen­dants in the dock at Nurem­berg has be­come iconic. Ex­ud­ing ut­ter self-right­eous­ness, none of them ad­mit­ted guilt over the hor­rors after the in­dict­ments were read. The ac­cused claimed they were either un­aware or that they acted un­der or­ders.</p>
    <p>Sit­ting in the first row among the ac­cused, Her­mann Gor­ing, Hitler’s long-time se­cond in com­mand, de­nied any knowl­edge of the atroc­i­ties – against all ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>At the end of the first trial in Oc­to­ber 1946, 12 of the ac­cused were hanged and the oth­ers either ac­quit­ted or sen­tenced to prison.</p>
    <p>A par­tic­u­lar aim of the Nurem­berg tri­als was that they would not act as a vic­tor’s tri­bunal over the de­feated.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can chief pros­e­cu­tor Robert Jack­son made sure of this. He said in his open­ing state­ment: “That four great na­tions, flushed with vic­tory and stung with in­jury, stay the hand of vengeance and vol­un­tar­ily sub­mit their cap­tive en­e­mies to the judg­ment of the law is one of the most sig­nif­i­cant trib­utes that power has ever paid to rea­son.”</p>
    <p>He had to con­vince the court, es­pe­cially his Rus­sian coun­ter­part, that this would be the way to pro­ceed. Mr Jack­son was a staunch op­po­nent of any­thing that would look like a show trial, Moscow-style.</p>
    <p>Most im­por­tantly, Nurem­berg also laid the foun­da­tion for a com­pre­hen­sive col­lec­tion of facts.</p>
    <p>Through­out the 218 days of the tri­als, thou­sands of doc­u­ments and pieces of ev­i­dence were brought to the ta­ble, and 240 wit­nesses tes­ti­fied. All of it was recorded in 16,000 pages.</p>
    <p>A FIRE­WALL</p>
    <p>The col­lected ma­te­rial was used like a fire­wall against any rein­ter­pre­ta­tion of his­tory and the cre­ation of myths.</p>
    <p>After the tri­als, no one could se­ri­ously ar­gue that the atroc­i­ties were an in­ven­tion by the vic­tors of war or some sin­is­ter forces.</p>
    <p>Nurem­berg was fol­lowed by other tri­als, like the one against the so-called Ein­satz­grup­pen, the SS death squads op­er­at­ing be­hind the front lines; and the Frank­furt Auschwitz tri­als for the mass killings of Euro­pean Jews in the ex­ter­mi­na­tion camp in Auschwitz.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in the 1950s and</p>
    <p>1960s, the public ap­petite for learn­ing about past atroc­i­ties was wan­ing. Ger­mans were busy re­build­ing their coun­try and en­joy­ing the Wirtschaft­swun­der (eco­nomic mir­a­cle) of its rise from the ru­ins of World War II.</p>
    <p>Only after the stu­dent up­ris­ing of 1968 in Europe did the tide turn. A new gen­er­a­tion of Ger­mans even­tu­ally started ask­ing their par­ents and grand­par­ents what they did dur­ing the so-called Third Re­ich.</p>
    <p>A cul­ture of com­mem­o­ra­tion was in­creas­ingly seen – most vis­i­bly in the form of a field of ste­lae in the cen­tre of Ber­lin for the Holo­caust.</p>
    <p>But as the years go by and with fewer eye­wit­nesses still alive, the ques­tion re­mains of how Ger­many can pre­serve this cul­ture with­out it be­com­ing rit­u­alised.</p>
    <p>To­mor­row, 75 years after the Nurem­berg tri­als, Ger­man Pres­i­dent Frank-Wal­ter Stein­meier will mark their an­niver­sary as he de­liv­ers a speech dur­ing a com­mem­o­ra­tion cer­e­mony. This will take place in Court­room 600 at the Palace of Jus­tice in Nurem­berg, the same place where the Nazi lead­ers were made to an­swer for their war crimes in a trial that put in place laws still in use to­day in the pur­suit of jus­tice.</p>
