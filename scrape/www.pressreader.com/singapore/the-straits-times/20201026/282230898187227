    <p>It is heart­en­ing that more sec­ondary schools are ex­pand­ing their lit­er­a­ture reper­toire so that both for­eign and lo­cal texts are be­ing pop­u­larised (Lit­er­a­ture a sub­ject with real-world rel­e­vance: NIE study, Oct 20).</p>
    <p>It was not un­com­mon for par­ents and teach­ers alike to be of the view that, un­like math­e­mat­ics and sci­ence, lit­er­a­ture was a sub­ject that stu­dents could not score top marks in.</p>
    <p>It was also per­ceived that the sub­ject had lit­tle prac­ti­cal rel­e­vance in the real world as it did not trans­late into mon­e­tary gains. Stu­dents were also not at­tracted to the pre­scribed texts as they were less di­verse.</p>
    <p>The im­por­tance of study­ing lit­er­a­ture, de­scribed as the “lan­guage of the soul”, can­not be overem­pha­sised as it is ac­knowl­edged to be a mir­ror and re­flec­tion of so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Over the cen­turies, it has had a ma­jor im­pact in the de­vel­op­ment of so­ci­ety by shap­ing civil­i­sa­tions, chang­ing po­lit­i­cal sys­tems, think­ing pat­terns, cul­tures and so­cial norms.</p>
    <p>Lit­er­a­ture also gives us a per­spec­tive on hu­man ex­pe­ri­ences from the real world and al­lows us to ques­tion some of our pre­dom­i­nant be­liefs and ex­am­ine our lives, giv­ing them deeper mean­ing. They also en­cour­age imag­i­na­tion and cre­ativ­ity, thereby en­rich­ing our lives.</p>
    <p>Sub­tract lit­er­a­ture from so­ci­ety and the re­sult will be ig­no­rance, il­lit­er­acy and stereo­typ­ing of other hu­mans and cul­tures. Gov­ern­ment lead­ers ex­hort us to be more cre­ative and in­no­va­tive, but un­less they are more proac­tive in fos­ter­ing the learn­ing of lit­er­a­ture in schools, we can­not look for­ward to be­ing a so­ci­ety with a “soul”. As cel­e­brated Bri­tish scholar and nov­el­ist C. S. Lewis said, “it ir­ri­gates the deserts that our lives have al­ready be­come”.</p>
    <p>With Sin­ga­pore be­ing ad­mired for its tech­no­log­i­cal progress, there is now a greater need to strike a bal­ance and es­tab­lish it as a cul­tural oa­sis.</p>
    <p>Greater par­tic­i­pa­tion in the lit­er­ary scene will also give Sin­ga­pore more clout and en­able our lit­er­ary and arts scene to be more ac­tive, lo­cally and over­seas, on top of giv­ing it greater cul­tural diver­sity and iden­tity.</p>
