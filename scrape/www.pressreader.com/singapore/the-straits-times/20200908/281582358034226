    <p>Pri­vate sec­tor econ­o­mists made a fur­ther cut to their 2020 forecast for Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy, but they turned more bullish about the strength of a re­cov­ery next year. The econ­omy may shrink by</p>
    <p>6 per cent this year, ac­cord­ing to a quar­terly sur­vey by the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore, slightly worse than the 5.8 per cent con­trac­tion pre­dicted in the pre­vi­ous sur­vey re­leased in June.</p>
    <p>Pri­vate sec­tor econ­o­mists made a fur­ther cut to their 2020 forecast for Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy but turned more bullish about the strength of a re­cov­ery next year.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy may shrink by 6 per cent this year, ac­cord­ing to a quar­terly sur­vey of 26 econ­o­mists and an­a­lysts by the Mon­e­tary Auth or­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS), slightly worse than the 5.8 per cent con­trac­tion pre­dicted in the pre­vi­ous sur­vey re­leased in June.</p>
    <p>But the pro­fes­sional fore­cast­ers ex­pect growth in gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) to re­cover to 5.5 per cent next year, up from the 4.8 per cent they had tipped ear­lier, MAS said in the sur­vey report yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try (MTI) last month low­ered its out­look for the fifth time this year, with the econ­omy now forecast to shrink by 5 per cent to 7 per cent.</p>
    <p>MTI’s cut would make this year’s re­ces­sion Sin­ga­pore’s worst since in­de­pen­dence. So far, there is no of­fi­cial forecast for 2021.</p>
    <p>Ms Se­lena Ling, OCBC Bank’s head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy, said there is still a sig­nif­i­cant de­gree of un­cer­tainty at­tached to the 2021 out­come, as cau­tioned by many pol­i­cy­mak­ers world­wide.</p>
    <p>“Even as­sum­ing 5.5 per cent growth in 2021, the value of Sin­ga­pore GDP will not re­turn to the 2019 pre-Covid-19 lev­els,” she said.</p>
    <p>OCBC’s 2021 growth forecast is at a more con­ser­va­tive 4 per cent.</p>
    <p>The down­grade of the 2020 growth in the MAS sur­vey was pred­i­cated on a weaker out­look for con­struc­tion, ac­com­mo­da­tion and food services, and pri­vate con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>United Overseas Bank econ­o­mist Barn­abas Gan said the soft­ness in the con­struc­tion sec­tor is likely to con­tinue into the sec­ond half of the year. “We re­main con­cerned about the spread of Covid-19 in worker dor­mi­to­ries.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, me­dian fore­casts im­proved for man­u­fac­tur­ing, fi­nance and in­surance, whole­sale and re­tail trade, and non-oil do­mes­tic ex­ports over the June sur­vey.</p>
    <p>Ms Ling said: “The ra­tio­nale for these forecast re­vi­sions can be at­trib­uted to the strong risk-on sen­ti­ments since the re­open­ing of global and do­mes­tic economies since June.”</p>
    <p>Ma­jor cen­tral banks’ com­mit­ments to keep mon­e­tary pol­icy ac­com­moda­tive for longer, and yield­seek­ing in­vestor be­hav­iour due to the very low in­ter­est rate en­vi­ron­ment have aided ac­tiv­i­ties in the fi­nance and in­surance seg­ment, she said. In ad­di­tion, pent-up de­mand af­ter the lo­cal econ­omy moved into phase two of its re­open­ing in June has buoyed re­tail sales, she noted.</p>
    <p>For the third quar­ter of this year, the an­a­lysts polled for the sur­vey ex­pect the econ­omy to con­tract 7.6 per cent year on year, eas­ing from the sec­ond quar­ter’s record 13.2 per cent plunge. MTI is likely to is­sue ad­vance es­ti­mates for the July to Septem­ber pe­riod later this month.</p>
    <p>A fur­ther de­te­ri­o­ra­tion in the coro­n­avirus sit­u­a­tion due to fur­ther waves of out­breaks or de­lays in vac­cine de­vel­op­ment topped the list of down­side risks to Sin­ga­pore’s growth out­look in the lat­est sur­vey.</p>
    <p>Ninety per cent of the re­spon­dents cited the risk of a sec­ondary out­break and 75 per cent ranked it as the top down­side risk.</p>
    <p>An es­ca­la­tion in United StatesChin­a ten­sions was iden­ti­fied by 60 per cent as a down­side risk, up from 55.6 per cent in the pre­vi­ous sur­vey.</p>
    <p>Re­spon­dents were also con­cerned about risks stem­ming from a slow­erthan-ex­pected global eco­nomic re­cov­ery, with 25 per cent iden­ti­fy­ing it as a risk, com­pared with 16.7 per cent in the ear­lier sur­vey.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the con­tain­ment of the out­break again emerged as the most fre­quently cited up­side risk.</p>
    <p>Seventy-five per cent of the re­spon­dents listed it, and 60 per cent ranked it as the top up­side risk.</p>
    <p>Re­spon­dents also iden­ti­fied stronger-than-ex­pected man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor per­for­mance as a key up­side risk. In ad­di­tion, 30 per cent of them flagged eas­ing US-China ten­sions as an up­side risk, up from 16.7 per cent in the pre­vi­ous sur­vey.</p>
