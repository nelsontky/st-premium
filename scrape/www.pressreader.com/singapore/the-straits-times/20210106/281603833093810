    <p>Newly ar­rived for­eign work­ers must now un­dergo an ad­di­tional seven-day test­ing regime at a des­ig­nated fa­cil­ity af­ter com­plet­ing their 14-day stay-home no­tice (SHN) be­fore they can en­ter a dor­mi­tory, the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The new re­quire­ment takes ef­fect to­day and is aimed at min­imis­ing the risk of im­ported Covid-19 in­fec­tions tak­ing hold in dorms.</p>
    <p>This had been seen as a “very low level” risk by the multi-min­istry task force, given the 14-day SHNs and poly­merase chain re­ac­tion exit tests that have been em­ployed.</p>
    <p>But MOM has started ap­prov­ing the en­try of far more for­eign work­ers, so the tougher test­ing sys­tem is seen as a way of min­imis­ing the chance of in­fec­tions get­ting into the dorms and trig­ger­ing a new clus­ter. Work­ers will move into their dorms af­ter com­plet­ing the new test­ing regime.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing the seven days at the des­ig­nated fa­cil­ity, the newly ar­rived work­ers will un­dergo ad­di­tional swab tests, and will still be able to go to work,” MOM added.</p>
    <p>Work­ers who test pos­i­tive will be iso­lated and taken to a hos­pi­tal or com­mu­nity care fa­cil­ity. Their close con­tacts will also be quar­an­tined.</p>
    <p>A mea­sure last April stip­u­lated that around 180,000 for­eign work­ers in the con­struc­tion sec­tor and their de­pen­dants had to serve 14-day SHNs to stem the spread of Covid-19 at work sites.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers could ap­ply to have some work­ers ex­empted so they could carry out es­sen­tial ser­vices like mos­quito con­trol at con­struc­tion sites. The SHN was ex­tended by 14 more days on May 1 for these work­ers af­ter the num­ber of in­fec­tions con­tin­ued to rise among con­struc­tion work-pass hold­ers who were stay­ing in premises that were not pur­pose-built dorms.</p>
