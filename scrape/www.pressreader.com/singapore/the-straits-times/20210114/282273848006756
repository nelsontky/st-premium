        <p>Telco StarHub’s sub-brand Giga has apol­o­gised for a spate of ser­vice dis­rup­tions and billing er­rors that have af­fected some cus­tomers, sev­eral of whom ap­pear to be new to the brand’s con­tract­free mo­bile plans.</p>
        <p>More than 70 users took to the brand’s Face­book page last week to com­plain about hav­ing dif­fi­cul­ties with their cell and In­ter­net ser­vice, with many not­ing that they had been over­charged re­peat­edly by the com­pany.</p>
        <p>In re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times, Giga on Tues­day said that it had rec­ti­fied the “tem­po­rary is­sue”, which arose from an ear­lier sched­uled main­te­nance that had in­ad­ver­tently af­fected “a small num­ber” of cus­tomers.</p>
        <p>The com­pany said af­fected cus­tomers had en­coun­tered “brief ser­vice dif­fi­cul­ties” or un­in­tended charges in their bills.</p>
        <p>Ms Aletheia Y. P., the head of</p>
        <p>Giga, said the com­pany “im­me­di­ately started ser­vice re­cov­ery work for im­pacted cus­tomers, as well as pro­vided them with reg­u­lar up­dates”.</p>
        <p>“We con­firm that the is­sue has been fully rec­ti­fied and all un­in­tended charges will be fully re­funded within a week,” she said.</p>
        <p>How­ever, af­fected cus­tomers ST spoke to said the re­sponse from the com­pany has been slow.</p>
        <p>Sev­eral of the af­fected cus­tomers who wrote on Giga’s Face­book page said they had dif­fi­cul­ties us­ing their new phone plans last week.</p>
        <p>Mr Ter­ence Ong, 27, a stu­dent, said he tried mul­ti­ple times to get a re­sponse from the com­pany through its chat­bot and on Face­book when he could not get any cell and In­ter­net ser­vice af­ter re­ceiv­ing his Giga SIM card on Jan 6.</p>
        <p>How­ever, the com­pany’s re­sponse was in­ter­mit­tent, once re­ply­ing only af­ter six hours and at other times not re­ply­ing at all.</p>
        <p>Giga was able to re­solve the is­sue only on Mon­day even­ing, said Mr Ong, who had no cell ser­vice for five days.</p>
        <p>He also said the com­pany at­tempted to charge him $468 in a span of three days, al­though the plan he signed up for was sup­posed to cost only $9 in the first month.</p>
        <p>Sim­i­larly, Giga user Au­gus­tine Jiang, 32, was billed mul­ti­ple times by the com­pany last week. The civil ser­vant changed to a dif­fer­ent Giga plan last week, but found that he was billed $256.32 in to­tal over three days, de­spite sign­ing up for a plan that should have cost $10 a month.</p>
        <p>The com­pany con­tin­ued to add to the charges even af­ter he e-mailed it about the er­ror.</p>
        <p>Said Mr Jiang: “It took them three days be­fore they had an of­fi­cial mes­sage on their Face­book page ac­knowl­edg­ing the prob­lem.</p>
        <p>“I was kind of wor­ried in be­tween, be­cause their chat­bot was very slow and in­ac­tive.”</p>
        <p>Giga said it is con­tact­ing af­fected cus­tomers to of­fer “a sin­cere apol­ogy” and a one-month free plan sub­scrip­tion.</p>
