    <p>Five months af­ter din­ers were urged to keep com­mu­nity eat­ing ar­eas clean as part of Sin­ga­pore’s fight against Covid-19, the re­sults ap­pear patchy. While some din­ers at hawker cen­tres and food­courts make the ef­fort to clean up be­fore and af­ter their meals, most are con­tent to leave this to clean­ers.</p>
    <p>Five months af­ter din­ers were urged to keep com­mu­nity eat­ing ar­eas clean as part of Sin­ga­pore’s fight against Covid-19, the re­sults ap­pear patchy.</p>
    <p>While some din­ers at hawker cen­tres and food­courts make the ef­fort to clean up be­fore and af­ter their meals, most are con­tent to leave this to clean­ers.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary, the SG Clean cam­paign was launched to raise hy­giene stan­dards across the coun­try, par­tic­u­larly at com­mu­nity din­ing places.</p>
    <p>The next month, the cam­paign was co-opted in Sin­ga­pore’s fight against the grow­ing pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Then Min­is­ter for the En­vi­ron­ment and Wa­ter Re­sources Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli urged din­ers not to leave pieces of used tis­sue in­side their bowls, de­scrib­ing them as “lit­tle bio­haz­ards that you leave on the ta­ble”.</p>
    <p>A net­work of SG Clean am­bas­sadors was also launched to co­or­di­nate ef­forts to pro­mote per­sonal hy­giene and so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity in a bid to help re­duce the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Among other things, the SG Clean task force said din­ers should con­sume their food off trays in­stead of plac­ing bowls and plates di­rectly on ta­bles.</p>
    <p>They should also re­turn their dirty dishes and uten­sils to tray sta­tions, and not leave their used tis­sue pa­per be­hind.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing checks at var­i­ous hawker cen­tres and cof­fee shops yes­ter­day, The Straits Times ob­served that while some din­ers made the ef­fort to keep their eat­ing area clean – some going so far as to wipe down the ta­ble and their uten­sils – most left this to clean­ers.</p>
    <p>The places vis­ited in­cluded the Seran­goon Gar­den mar­ket and hawker cen­tre, Teck Ghee wet mar­ket and hawker cen­tre, and the Fei Siong-run Ci Yuan so­cial en­ter­prise hawker cen­tre in Hougang.</p>
    <p>On av­er­age, eight out of 10 din­ers did not fol­low the SG Clean rec­om­men­da­tions.</p>
    <p>Few kept their bowls and plates on the tray while eat­ing. Most left their crock­ery and uten­sils on the ta­ble when they fin­ished in­stead of re­turn­ing them.</p>
    <p>Din­ers were also seen not only throw­ing used tis­sue pa­per on trays, plates and in bowls, but also leav­ing them be­hind on ta­bles and chairs.</p>
    <p>Clean­ers were hard at work mak­ing sure the mess was cleared up.</p>
    <p>Only two out of 30 peo­ple in­ter­viewed said they were aware of the SG Clean guide­lines.</p>
    <p>One was in­sur­ance agent David Goh, 28, who was hav­ing break­fast at the Seran­goon Gar­den mar­ket and hawker cen­tre. Both Mr Goh and his wife Melissa, 29, a home­maker, were eat­ing off their trays.</p>
    <p>“It is just more con­ve­nient to eat off the tray for us. If it makes a cleaner’s job eas­ier while keep­ing the ta­ble clean for the next diner, that is a win-win sit­u­a­tion,” said Mr Goh.</p>
    <p>He added that he and his wife have a habit of re­turn­ing their trays to the des­ig­nated ar­eas pro­vided.</p>
    <p>Other din­ers had their own rea­sons for not eat­ing off trays, but said they were try­ing their best to keep the ta­bles clean.</p>
    <p>Ms Jenny Lim, 56, owner of a cloth­ing store at Teck Ghee mar­ket, said that while she cleans the ta­ble and uten­sils with wet wipes be­fore and af­ter eat­ing, she will not eat off the tray be­cause of the “bad smell”.</p>
    <p>“Un­like the bowls and uten­sils which are washed with soap, I see the trays be­ing wiped down with the same dirty cloth that is rinsed in the same bucket, then re­turned to the stalls right af­ter,” she said.</p>
    <p>Most din­ers were un­aware of the rec­om­men­da­tion to not leave tis­sue pa­per around, and thought it was not their re­spon­si­bil­ity to re­turn the trays as there were clean­ers around.</p>
    <p>“The clean­ers are here for a rea­son, and it is their job to clean the ta­bles. I am also not sure where else I should be putting my used tis­sues, if not in the bowl,” said a univer­sity stu­dent in his 20s who was at Ci Yuan Hawker Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>“What I do is pile my dishes back onto a tray to make it eas­ier to re­move, and I think that is more than most peo­ple do any­way,” he added.</p>
    <p>Among din­ers who prac­tised good hy­giene habits was house­wife Theresa Chan, who is in her 50s.</p>
    <p>“Even though it might be un­pleas­ant, I think us­ing a tray and re­turn­ing it helps to lessen the clean­ers’ work­load,” said Ms Chan, who was hav­ing lunch at Teck Ghee mar­ket.</p>
    <p>She added that good hy­giene habits should be in­cul­cated from a young age, and that ad­vis­ing peo­ple to keep com­mu­nity din­ing ar­eas clean should ex­tend be­yond the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We should start young and en­cour­age and com­mend kids when they prac­tise good hy­giene, so it be­comes sec­ond na­ture when they are older,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Though we hope for ev­ery­one to prac­tise good hy­giene dur­ing and af­ter the Covid-19 pan­demic, I think it will take a long time for peo­ple, old and young alike, to change their habits. We can’t ex­pect this change to be in­stant, but we should start now,” she added.</p>
