    <p>The Hong Kong court, in pass­ing judg­ment yes­ter­day on three prom­i­nent ac­tivists, sent a clear mes­sage to the pro-democ­racy bloc, as well as to any­one who sup­ports or has par­tic­i­pated in the re­cent civil un­rest, po­lit­i­cal watch­ers told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>At least one po­lit­i­cal watcher, Pro­fes­sor Sing Ming from The Hong Kong Univer­sity of Science and Tech­nol­ogy, be­lieves the court’s de­ci­sion was likely to have a sig­nif­i­cant im­pact in­ter­na­tion­ally.</p>
    <p>The West Kowloon Mag­is­trates’ Courts handed down jail terms of be­tween seven months and 131/</p>
    <p>2 months to three for­mer De­mo­sisto mem­bers – Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow and Ivan Lam – for in­cit­ing and or­gan­is­ing pro­test­ers who be­sieged the Hong Kong po­lice head­quar­ters in Wan Chai in June last year. Wong re­ceived the stiffest sen­tence.</p>
    <p>Af­ter tak­ing their guilty pleas into ac­count, mag­is­trate Wong Sze-lai said a de­ter­rent sen­tence was nec­es­sary to safe­guard pub­lic in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>Prof Sing and As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Al­fred Wu from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Pub­lic Pol­icy be­lieve the sen­tences were meant to strike fear of the law in any­one at­tempt­ing to demon­strate or in­cite ral­lies.</p>
    <p>Prof Wu said: “I think the court de­ci­sion is to try to pre­vent the oth­ers from do­ing the same, like a sig­nal.</p>
    <p>“It’s very much like the court wants to de­liver a mes­sage and this mes­sage would be heard clearly.”</p>
    <p>He noted that any­one still thinking of break­ing the law now knows the cost.</p>
    <p>Prof Sing pointed out that Wong’s sen­tence was some­what in the mid­dle ground as the max­i­mum pun­ish­ment for the of­fence is three years.</p>
    <p>He said Hong Kong had be­come “ex­tremely re­pres­sive” since the en­act­ment of the na­tional se­cu­rity law and very in­tim­i­dat­ing for or­di­nary pro­test­ers and ac­tivists.</p>
    <p>Prof Sing added that, more im­por­tantly, any dra­matic sen­tenc­ing or po­lit­i­cal events con­cern­ing Wong would be widely re­ported and “they will give am­mu­ni­tion to over­seas pro-democ­racy ac­tivists such as Nathan Law and Alex Chow”.</p>
    <p>He said this will “add to their am­mu­ni­tion for the for­eign na­tions con­cerned with Hong Kong, or even to con­struct more pow­er­ful poli­cies against China”.</p>
    <p>“So these kinds of tri­als do bear tremen­dous po­lit­i­cal sig­nif­i­cance in the in­ter­na­tional sense,” he said.</p>
    <p>But Prof Wu be­lieves oth­er­wise, say­ing that for­eign na­tions’ ac­tions and poli­cies to­wards China are “not just purely based on Hong Kong”, but also on other do­mes­tic and in­ter­na­tional fac­tors.</p>
    <p>When asked, Prof Sing said Wong, who is also fac­ing charges over a protest in Oc­to­ber last year and a June 4 memo­rial mark­ing the 1989 Tianan­men crack­down, might miss the Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil elec­tions in Novem­ber next year.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing, Prof Sing added, “can use all kinds of pre­text to dis­qual­ify some po­ten­tial can­di­dates with po­lit­i­cal charisma like Joshua Wong and Agnes Chow eas­ily”.</p>
    <p>Wong earned Bei­jing’s wrath last year for par­tic­i­pat­ing in a United States con­gres­sional hear­ing in which he urged Congress to pass a Bill that would al­low for greater sanc­tions against Hong Kong, in an­tic­i­pa­tion of the ero­sion of free­doms in­clud­ing on speech and as­sem­bly. The Bill was passed two months later by the US House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives and the Se­nate, and signed by Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump soon af­ter.</p>
    <p>Wong was among the can­di­dates who se­cured the most votes in an un­of­fi­cial pri­mary held by the pan-demo­cratic camp in July, even though of­fi­cials even­tu­ally dis­qual­i­fied him for the leg­isla­tive elec­tions.</p>
