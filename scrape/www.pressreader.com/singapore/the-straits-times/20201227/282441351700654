    <p>When some­one asks for prop­erty buy­ing tips, I al­ways of­fer this bit of ad­vice – buy one that will have no trou­ble find­ing buyers eas­ily next time.</p>
    <p>This seems like a con­tra­dic­tion, es­pe­cially if you are buy­ing a home with the aim of liv­ing there for the long term. So why the need to con­sider the mar­ketabil­ity of the home dur­ing your house hunt­ing?</p>
    <p>The re­al­ity is that for many Sin­ga­pore­ans, their first home is un­likely to be their last and so it is al­ways better to buy with the fore­sight that you will need to sell it in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>This ad­vice is not as straight for­ward as it seems be­cause it comes with many con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>When you are look­ing for a home that would also be de­sired by other buyers, it means you are set­ting your sight on a good-qual­ity prop­erty with many at­trac­tive fea­tures.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, if your bud­get per­mits, why set­tle for a medi­ocre place when you can choose the best unit in the whole de­vel­op­ment?</p>
    <p>And since you are look­ing for the best, why not choose one that will make it stand out in the en­tire neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>Lest you think this re­quire­ment un­fairly favours the rich, know that not all prop­er­ties are built equally and nei­ther will all buyers come with the same bud­gets and ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>What this means is that as far as pos­si­ble, try to look for the best unit in the same prop­erty class.</p>
    <p>The big­gest units such as pent­houses, for ex­am­ple, are likely to draw fewer po­ten­tial buyers than smaller ones sim­ply be­cause the price tags will de­ter those with smaller bud­gets. So if you can af­ford such a home, make sure you choose the best unit that your money can get.</p>
    <p>The “best in class” bench­mark should also ap­ply if you are look­ing for smaller and more af­ford­able units, such as stu­dios or one- twobed­room apart­ments.</p>
    <p>I know some prop­erty in­vestors are less choosy when mak­ing their pur­chases as they will not be liv­ing in such homes any­way.</p>
    <p>But guess what? If you are buy­ing for in­vest­ment, you need to put in even more ef­fort be­cause a less­ap­peal­ing home means it will be harder for you to find ten­ants and buyers at your ask­ing price.</p>
    <p>Of course, this is eas­ier said than done be­cause peo­ple’s pref­er­ences vary. But here are some com­mon bench­marks you can use as a guide when look­ing for a new home.</p>
    <p>A HOME WITH THE ‘WOW’ FAC­TOR</p>
    <p>You know you are look­ing at one such home when you could not help but go “wow” the mo­ment you step in­side. Such units usu­ally sit on higher floors and have an un­blocked and ex­pan­sive view of the sky­line – be it the city or sea.</p>
    <p>Or it could be one with gen­er­ous liv­ing space and an out­stand­ing in­te­rior de­sign.</p>
    <p>As first im­pres­sions count, such homes usu­ally will not stay long in the mar­ket if the sell­ing prices are not ex­or­bi­tant.</p>
    <p>But there is a big catch – if you are choos­ing a new unit from the de­vel­oper’s plan, you will not know for sure how the view looks like un­til the build­ing is up.</p>
    <p>You can try to vi­su­alise but noth­ing beats see­ing it for your­self.</p>
    <p>This is why folks who are par­tic­u­lar about an apart­ment’s views and per­spec­tives usu­ally look at com­pleted units only. They know that some de­vel­op­ers usu­ally keep the pre­mium units at slightly higher re­served prices and so they are pre­pared to wait be­fore they buy their dream home.</p>
    <p>LO­CA­TION MAT­TERS A LOT</p>
    <p>It goes with­out say­ing that lo­ca­tion is one of the key fac­tors that de­ter­mine the value of a prop­erty. Tra­di­tion­ally, those in the main city ar­eas usu­ally com­mand far higher pre­mi­ums than those in sub­ur­ban dis­tricts.</p>
    <p>As far as pos­si­ble, try to look for the best unit in the same prop­erty class. The big­gest units such as pent­houses, for ex­am­ple, are likely to draw fewer po­ten­tial buyers than smaller ones sim­ply be­cause the price tags will de­ter those with smaller bud­gets. So if you can af­ford such a home, make sure you choose the best unit that your money can get.</p>
    <p>But thanks to Sin­ga­pore’s well­con­ceived MRT net­work as well as the de­vel­op­ment of neigh­bour­hood towns, homes that are near sub­ur­ban ameni­ties can also com­mand higher prices.</p>
    <p>So in­stead of just look­ing at the ad­dress, buyers should also con­sider fac­tors that are just as if not more important, such as whether the unit is near an MRT sta­tion, malls, good schools and parks.</p>
    <p>Parks have be­come a de­sir­able amenity now be­cause their car parks were closed dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker. This has made many peo­ple re­alise the con­ve­nience and ben­e­fit of liv­ing near a park, es­pe­cially if you like to jog and take long walk.</p>
    <p>HEIGHT AND FAC­ING</p>
    <p>Peo­ple who have been liv­ing in units on higher floors will tell you that they are less wor­ried dur­ing the dengue sea­son be­cause mos­qui­toes usu­ally are not com­mon on up­per lev­els, un­less the oc­ca­sional one hitches a ride in the lift.</p>
    <p>These higher floors have better views as well, which is why such apart­ments usu­ally fetch better prices.</p>
    <p>But the as­pect counts too, such as whether the unit faces the pool or open space.</p>
    <p>Even if the scenery is not breath­tak­ing, you would do better by not</p>
    <p>choos­ing units that face un­de­sir­able views such as un­sightly build­ings, busy high­ways or in­dus­trial es­tates. Even if you do not mind liv­ing with such views, the as­pect is likely to de­ter your fu­ture buyers.</p>
    <p>DE­SIGN AND FEA­TURES</p>
    <p>De­vel­op­ers of good homes know how to max­imise space for the com­fort of the oc­cu­pants as well as</p>
    <p>use de­signs that make most parts of the unit brighter.</p>
    <p>But once in a while, we will come across homes that do not have oc­cu­pant-friendly de­signs.</p>
    <p>They might have un­usu­ally large open bal­conies but tiny liv­ing space and oddly-shaped rooms.</p>
    <p>Imag­ine liv­ing in a two-bed­room apart­ment that has an L-shaped open bal­cony that en­cir­cles the home but one of its bed­rooms is so</p>
    <p>small that it hardly fits a work desk, let alone a bed.</p>
    <p>While such a de­sign may ap­peal to a hand­ful of peo­ple who en­joy spend­ing time out­doors, it will cer­tainly turn off even small fam­i­lies who will need an ex­tra room for their kids.</p>
    <p>And there are de­vel­op­ers that do not have high re­gard for the “mas­ters of the house”, oth­er­wise, how to ex­plain why the main bed­room is next to the front door or util­ity ar­eas for air-con con­densers.</p>
    <p>SU­PER­STI­TION AND BACK­GROUND</p>
    <p>In a multi-cul­tural so­ci­ety, you can­not ig­nore the fact that some buyers are very par­tic­u­lar about things that even sci­ence can­not ex­plain.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, some peo­ple are turned off by the num­ber four (sounds like “die” in Chi­nese) and the num­ber 13. This is why some de­vel­op­ers avoid us­ing such numbers for their homes. Then there is the study of ge­o­mancy, which is even harder to fathom.</p>
    <p>Be­fore you com­mit to a pur­chase, you should do an on­line search for news re­lated to your in­tended buy to see if the prop­erty had been the scene of a crime or an un­nat­u­ral death. But such checks are not fool-proof as not all cases are re­ported.</p>
    <p>If you want peace of mind, you should ask the seller or the agent this ques­tion point-blank. While they have no le­gal duty to make a full dis­clo­sure, giv­ing a false re­ply can give you grounds to sue them for mis­lead­ing you.</p>
    <p>As a prop­erty pur­chase is go­ing to cost you a lot of money, be dili­gent about do­ing your home­work so as to get the best deal – and best home too.</p>
