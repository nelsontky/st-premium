    <p>Fancy a job that pays six fig­ures a month?</p>
    <p>The Sun­day Times found at least 10 jobs tout­ing salaries of $100,000 a month or more on the na­tional jobs por­tal MyCa­reer­sFu­ture.sg last month.</p>
    <p>Some of these list­ings have been edited as they were mis­tak­enly re­flect­ing an­nual wages and at­tract­ing dozens of ap­pli­ca­tions. Sev­eral, how­ever, re­main un­changed.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers said such salary of­fers are too good to be true, es­pe­cially in this un­cer­tain eco­nomic cli­mate.</p>
    <p>One project man­ager job is listed with a $160,000 to $200,000 monthly salary. The role, which in­volves com­ing up with dig­i­tal prod­ucts for the fi­nan­cial tech­nol­ogy mar­ket, seeks can­di­dates with 10 years of ex­pe­ri­ence. It has re­ceived some 40 ap­pli­ca­tions on the por­tal.</p>
    <p>Another list­ing for a fi­nan­cial ser­vices in­dus­try con­sul­tant with at least five years’ ex­pe­ri­ence of­fers a monthly pay of be­tween $130,000 and $200,000. It has over 30 ap­pli­ca­tions. When con­tacted, the firm clar­i­fied that it was a typo.</p>
    <p>These are prob­a­bly en­try blun­ders, said Mr Paul Heng, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of NeXT Ca­reer Con­sult­ing Group, adding that some of the salaries are per an­num fig­ures.</p>
    <p>Mr David Leong, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of hu­man re­sources firm Peo­ple-World­wide Con­sult­ing, said: “Typ­i­cally, those in the higher salary brack­ets are likely to be hunted by search con­sul­tants who will scour the best tal­ents for their clients.”</p>
    <p>Re­ply­ing to ST queries, some firms said these were ad­min­is­tra­tive mis­takes. Oth­ers did not re­spond.</p>
    <p>Omni Ma­chin­ery, which ser­vices and rents out mo­bile el­e­vated work plat­forms, ini­tially had a busi­ness de­vel­op­ment ex­ec­u­tive job list­ing of­fer­ing a monthly salary of $40,000 to $150,000.</p>
    <p>This was re­vised to $3,000 to $12,500 monthly on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Bryant Ee, the firm’s co­founder, pointed out the ad­min­is­tra­tive er­ror on the job ad­ver­tise­ment.</p>
    <p>On why the firm is hir­ing de­spite be­ing im­pacted by the pan­demic – the com­pany’s rev­enue saw a 70 per cent dip dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod when de­mand for its equip­ment fell – he said it is im­por­tant to plan ahead and find new ways of do­ing busi­ness. He ex­pects busi­ness to re­sume at nor­mal lev­els from next month and said new hires will have more time to pick up skills.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness soft­ware provider SAP Sin­ga­pore has also cor­rected a list­ing er­ror which placed the ma­chine learn­ing de­vel­oper’s salary at $60,000 to $120,000 monthly. This has been changed to $5,000 to $10,000 a month.</p>
    <p>The com­pany, which is hir­ing es­sen­tial and re­place­ment po­si­tions, is as­sist­ing firms to evolve the way they do busi­ness dig­i­tally, said its man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Eileen Chua.</p>
    <p>“No in­dus­tries have been spared by the pan­demic, with some bear­ing the brunt of the down­turn much more than oth­ers, but the growth of re­mote work­ing has helped us,” she said.</p>
