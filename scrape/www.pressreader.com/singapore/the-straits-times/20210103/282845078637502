    <p>LON­DON • Ever­ton’s first-team play­ers lacked match fit­ness in Fri­day’s 1-0 home de­feat by West Ham United, but man­ager Carlo Ancelotti hopes they can hit peak con­di­tion ahead of their Premier League clash against Wolver­hamp­ton Wan­der­ers on Jan 12.</p>
    <p>Brazil­ian for­ward Richarli­son was fit again fol­low­ing a con­cus­sion suf­fered in the League Cup but lacked sharp­ness in front of goal, as did Do­minic CalvertLew­in, Ever­ton’s top scorer this sea­son with 14 goals in all com­pe­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>James Ro­driguez, who missed the last five games ow­ing to a calf prob­lem, was not fit enough for a start­ing spot.</p>
    <p>But he came on as a sub­sti­tute as Ever­ton chased their fifth straight league vic­tory fol­low­ing wins against Chelsea, Le­ices­ter, Arse­nal and Sh­effield United.</p>
    <p>But a late strike from West Ham mid­fielder To­mas Soucek de­nied Ancelotti’s side a point and left them on 29 points from 16 games, four points be­hind lead­ers Liver­pool.</p>
    <p>“The mo­men­tum was good, we had dif­fi­cult games and a good run but it stopped to­day,” the Ital­ian told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“It will be im­por­tant to keep our be­lief and con­fi­dence high.</p>
    <p>“We have the pos­si­bil­ity in the next few days to have play­ers in bet­ter con­di­tion, play­ers who were not able to train in the past weeks, and look for­ward with be­lief.</p>
    <p>“We have play­ers with qual­ity who are not in their best con­di­tion, like James and Richarli­son, who was com­ing back from a con­cus­sion. Do­minic also had a prob­lem dur­ing the game and was not 100 per cent.”</p>
    <p>West Ham man­ager David Moyes, mean­while, said there has been a change in mind­set within his team this sea­son.</p>
    <p>The Ham­mers had the tough­est fes­tive fix­ture sched­ule in the Premier League with three games in six days, but fin­ished the stronger</p>
    <p>ALL GOOD THINGS MUST END</p>
    <p>The mo­men­tum was good, we had dif­fi­cult games and a good run but it stopped to­day. It will be im­por­tant to keep our be­lief and con­fi­dence high.</p>
    <p>of the sides as Soucek net­ted the win­ner four min­utes from time.</p>
    <p>“The play­ers have played three games in six games, they are amaz­ing,” said Moyes, who won for the first time as a vis­it­ing man­ager at Good­i­son Park, where he made his name dur­ing 11 years in charge of Ever­ton.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think there was any dif­fer­ence in the fit­ness lev­els so great credit to the play­ers, there has been a big change in the men­tal­ity here at West Ham.”</p>
