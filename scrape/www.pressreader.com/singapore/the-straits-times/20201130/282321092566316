    <p>MR EU­GENE WANG, So­phie’s Bionu­tri­ents CEO, whose com­pany is work­ing on plant-based pro­tein flours that can be used to make milk al­ter­na­tives.</p>
    <p>So­phie’s Bionu­tri­ents, a Sin­ga­pore­based start-up, has been work­ing on plant-based pro­tein flours that can be used to make milk al­ter­na­tives or en­ergy bev­er­ages.</p>
    <p>Its co-founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive Eu­gene Wang, 51, shared that the mar­ket for plant-based liq­uids is more ac­ces­si­ble than the one for meat al­ter­na­tives, given that plant­based milk does not re­quire the same ex­ten­sive re­search and de­vel­op­ment that meat-like prod­ucts do.</p>
    <p>He said: “Not only is plant milk tech­no­log­i­cally eas­ier to achieve, but it also has a won­der­fully big mar­ket, prob­a­bly even big­ger than the mar­ket for plant-based meat.”</p>
    <p>So­phie’s Bionu­tri­ents was the win­ner of En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore’s start-up com­pe­ti­tion Sling­shot in 2017, re­ceiv­ing $250,000. It also won $1 mil­lion from Te­masek Foun­da­tion’s The Live­abil­ity Chal­lenge last year.</p>
    <p>Apart from the grants, it has re­ceived $500,000 in fund­ing from De­nis Group, the owner of Ayam Brand. It is cur­rently work­ing on rais­ing Se­ries A fund­ing.</p>
    <p>The roots of So­phie’s Bionu­tri­ents are in Cal­i­for­nia, where Mr Wang, a Tai­wanese cit­i­zen, was based be­tween 2010 and 2017. But as part of the re­quire­ments af­ter win­ning Sling­shot, he moved here and in­cor­po­rated So­phie’s Bionu­tri­ents soon af­ter.</p>
    <p>Mov­ing to Sin­ga­pore also saw So­phie’s Bionu­tri­ents team of four ben­e­fit from work­ing with the Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search as well as Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>“If we can demon­strate that our tech­nolo­gies are vi­able here in Sin­ga­pore, where there is (lim­ited) space and fresh wa­ter for farm­ing, then we can prove to the world that this is truly a sus­tain­able green tech­nol­ogy to grow food,” Mr Wang said.</p>
    <p>The firm pro­duces food-grade pro­tein us­ing mi­croal­gae as an al­ter­na­tive to an­i­mal- and plant­based pro­tein, which is ex­pected to save large amounts of arable farm­land.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang, who used to work in his fam­ily’s mock meat busi­ness in Tai­wan, said So­phie’s Bionu­tri­ents cur­rently has two dif­fer­ent flours made from mi­croal­gae pro­tein ready for pro­duc­tion. The com­pany is in talks with a client that could po­ten­tially use the flour to pro­duce chicken essence, he said.</p>
    <p>The firm’s flour prod­ucts are ex­pen­sive, Mr Wang con­ceded, es­pe­cially since it is early days and the com­pany has yet to achieve economies of scale. But chicken essence is a prod­uct that could tol­er­ate higher pric­ing, he added.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has been both a boon and a bane for the busi­ness, said Mr Wang, who is ap­ply­ing for per­ma­nent res­i­dency in Sin­ga­pore. “With the pan­demic, pro­duc­tion was de­layed and so was our sched­ule. But on the bright side, it proved the real value of our tech­nol­ogy in ad­dress­ing food se­cu­rity and sup­ply chain dis­rup­tion is­sues,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang, who has a Mas­ter of Busi­ness Ad­min­is­tra­tion from Columbia Busi­ness School, said he thinks Sin­ga­pore will be­come a leader and pi­o­neer in food and agri­cul­ture tech­nolo­gies, given gov­ern­ment sup­port and its con­straints of space and nat­u­ral re­sources.</p>
    <p>“The fu­ture world we en­vi­sion is a world where all the food and nu­tri­ents are grown in a re­source crunch, where very lit­tle en­ergy, wa­ter, space and other re­sources are needed,” he said. “That is ex­actly what Sin­ga­pore is doing now.”</p>
