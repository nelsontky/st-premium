    <p>• Twit­ter is prob­ing a mas­sive hack of high-pro­file users rang­ing from Tesla chief ex­ec­u­tive Elon Musk to pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Joe Bi­den that has raised ques­tions about the plat­form’s se­cu­rity as it serves as a mega­phone for US politi­cians ahead of Novem­ber’s elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Posts try­ing to dupe peo­ple into send­ing hack­ers the vir­tual cur­rency bit­coin were tweeted by the of­fi­cial ac­counts of Ap­ple, Uber, rap­per Kanye West, Mi­crosoft co­founder Bill Gates, for­mer pres­i­dent Barack Obama and many oth­ers on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“We de­tected what we be­lieve to be a co­or­di­nated so­cial engi­neer­ing at­tack by peo­ple who suc­cess­fully tar­geted some of our em­ploy­ees with ac­cess to in­ter­nal sys­tems and tools,” Twit­ter said.</p>
    <p>The com­pany said the hack­ers tar­geted about 130 ac­counts, and were able to gain con­trol to a “small sub­set” of the tar­geted ac­counts, and send tweets from them.</p>
    <p>The fraud­u­lent posts, which were largely deleted, said peo­ple had 30 min­utes to send US$1,000 in the cryp­tocur­rency, promis­ing they would re­ceive twice as much in re­turn.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 12.58 bit­coins – worth al­most US$116,000 (S$161,263)– were sent to e-mail ad­dresses men­tioned in the tweets, ac­cord­ing to blockchain.com</p>
    <p>The Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion’s San Fran­cisco divi­sion, which was in­ves­ti­gat­ing, said: “We ad­vise the public not to fall vic­tim to this scam by send­ing cryp­tocur­rency or money in re­la­tion to this in­ci­dent.”</p>
    <p>The ac­count of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, which has 83.5 mil­lion fol­low­ers, was not tar­geted. “The Pres­i­dent will re­main on Twit­ter,” White House press sec­re­tary Kayleigh McE­nany said. “His ac­count was se­cure and not jeop­ar­dised dur­ing these at­tacks.”</p>
    <p>With the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion just over three months away, the in­flu­ence that so­cial me­dia plat­forms have on pol­i­tics has be­come a hotly de­bated is­sue.</p>
    <p>Just hours be­fore Wed­nes­day’s hack, the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives Com­mit­tee on Over­sight and Re­form called for the ap­point­ment of a na­tional cy­ber-se­cu­rity czar.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter locked down af­fected ac­counts and re­moved the fraud­u­lent tweets. It also locked ac­counts not af­fected by the hack as a pre­cau­tion.</p>
    <p>As of Thurs­day af­ter­noon, the com­pany was “work­ing to help peo­ple re­gain ac­cess to their ac­counts ASAP if they were proac­tively locked... tak­ing ex­tra steps to con­firm that we’re grant­ing ac­cess to the right­ful owner”.</p>
    <p>Vice re­ported that a Twit­ter in­sider was re­spon­si­ble for Wed­nes­day’s hack, cit­ing leaked screen­shots and two anony­mous sources ap­par­ently be­hind the hack, one of whom told the me­dia out­let he had paid the em­ployee.</p>
    <p>United States Se­na­tor Josh Haw­ley tweeted a let­ter to Twit­ter chief ex­ec­u­tive Jack Dorsey, ex­press­ing con­cern over pri­vacy for the com­pany’s mil­lions of users.</p>
    <p>“I am con­cerned that this event may rep­re­sent not merely a co­or­di­nated set of sep­a­rate hack­ing in­ci­dents but rather a suc­cess­ful at­tack on the se­cu­rity of Twit­ter it­self,” he said.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter had stepped up its search for a chief in­for­ma­tion se­cu­rity of­fi­cer in re­cent weeks, two sources told Reuters, be­fore the hack raised alarms about the plat­form’s se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the hack­ing cam­paign, an ad­ver­tise­ment went up on a grey mar­ket site that fa­cil­i­tates the trade of user ac­counts for many pop­u­lar web­sites, in­clud­ing Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>For US$250 in dig­i­tal cur­rency, the seller promised they would re­veal the e-mail linked to a Twit­ter ac­count. And for US$2,500, the buyer would get the ac­count it­self – sat­is­fac­tion guar­an­teed.</p>
    <p>“You will be given a full re­fund if for any rea­son you aren’t given the e-mail/@,” the poster said, de­scrib­ing the Twit­ter ac­count with an @ sign.</p>
    <p>The ad, a screen­shot of which was pro­vided to Reuters by Hud­son Rock, an Is­raeli com­pany that mon­i­tors on­line fo­rums for stolen cre­den­tials and breached data, was an early in­di­ca­tion that all was not well at Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>The fact that early word of the hack spread on a fo­rum pop­u­lar with gamers and In­sta­gram ac­count swop­pers sug­gests the in­ci­dent likely had a nexus with lowlevel cy­ber­crime rather than na­tion state-level sub­terfuge.</p>
    <p>“This doesn’t look like a par­tic­u­larly so­phis­ti­cated hack­ing group,” said Hud­son Rock chief ex­ec­u­tive Roi Carthy.</p>
    <p>CO­OR­DI­NATED AT­TACK</p>
    <p>We de­tected what we be­lieve to be a co­or­di­nated so­cial engi­neer­ing at­tack by peo­ple who suc­cess­fully tar­geted some of our em­ploy­ees with ac­cess to ’’ in­ter­nal sys­tems and tools. TWIT­TER, on the hack, which tar­geted about 130 ac­counts.</p>
