    <p>In one case, a male stu­dent tres­passed into mul­ti­ple hos­tel rooms on the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) cam­pus, to steal fe­male un­der­wear.</p>
    <p>The case was re­ported last Fe­bru­ary to the NUS Of­fice of Cam­pus Se­cu­rity, and was dealt with by the Board of Dis­ci­pline.</p>
    <p>The stu­dent was sus­pended for six semesters, and re­ferred to the Univer­sity Health Cen­tre for as­sess­ment and treat­ment of his psy­chi­atric con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>He was also barred from cam­pus dur­ing the pe­riod of sus­pen­sion and re­ceived an of­fi­cial let­ter of rep­ri­mand.</p>
    <p>This was one of the 12 com­plaints of sex­ual mis­con­duct NUS re­ceived last year. Nine of these were re­ported to the po­lice. Seven of the cases took place on cam­pus, while the rest hap­pened off cam­pus or on­line.</p>
    <p>Among last year’s cases was one that came to light in Novem­ber – a fe­male stu­dent com­plained that a male stu­dent had, with­out her con­sent, recorded video footage of them hav­ing sex.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions re­vealed there was a sec­ond fe­male stu­dent who was also filmed when she was hav­ing sex with the ac­cused, NUS said. The case is pend­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tion, and no-con­tact or­ders were is­sued to all three stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Sum­mary ac­tion was taken as an in­terim mea­sure, NUS said. This refers to with­draw­ing and/or sus­pend­ing any aca­demic or non-aca­demic univer­sity priv­i­leges of the ac­cused.</p>
    <p>In an­other case that sur­faced in Fe­bru­ary last year, a male ac­cused and a fe­male com­plainant – who were friends at the time of the in­ci­dent – slept to­gether in a stu­dent hos­tel room be­long­ing to a mu­tual friend, af­ter they had both con­sumed al­co­hol.</p>
    <p>The ac­cused mo­lested her and stopped af­ter she told him not to touch her, NUS said. Af­ter they woke up, he touched her again as she was pre­par­ing to leave the room.</p>
    <p>She made a po­lice re­port and the mu­tual friend sent a photo of a knife to her, which she per­ceived as a threat to make her drop her com­plaint against the ac­cused.</p>
    <p>No-con­tact or­ders were is­sued to all three stu­dents, and the case is pend­ing with the Board of Dis­ci­pline.</p>
