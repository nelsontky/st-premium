    <p>Repub­lic Poly­tech­nic’s e-mail in­trigues me. I have cooked with okara, which has the con­sis­tency of wet sand, and have a hard time imag­in­ing how it can be trans­formed into some­thing even re­motely re­sem­bling cream cheese. I turn up at the in­ter­view with a tub of Philadel­phia Cream Cheese so I can com­pare the two.</p>
    <p>CREAM CHEESE</p>
    <p>This is the most suc­cess­ful of the three prod­ucts, although its grey­ish hue is off-putting. The team has added dried Ital­ian herb sea­son­ing to it to boost the flavour. It has what I think is the right amount of salt, with the herbs do­ing their job ad­mirably. But the soya cheese does not have the thick, vel­vety tex­ture of the real thing.</p>
    <p>It also tastes slightly sweet, which is puz­zling, and the soya flavour is dis­cernible un­der­neath the dried herb dis­trac­tion.</p>
    <p>If they can work the kinks out – the colour and the tex­ture – and fig­ure out how else to flavour it apart from us­ing dried herbs, the prod­uct has po­ten­tial. I would love to spread my break­fast toast with some­thing that has less fat and sodium, more pro­tein, zero choles­terol and fewer calo­ries.</p>
    <p>And which tastes good.</p>
    <p>CREAM SOUP POW­DER</p>
    <p>What’s re­mark­able is how the gran­ules dis­solve quickly in boil­ing wa­ter, thick­en­ing it in an in­stant with­out lumps. Again, there is that puz­zling sweet­ness although it is sup­posed to have lower su­crose lev­els than com­pa­ra­ble prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>This, too, has po­ten­tial, as a nutritious thick­ener for soups and stews. I can imag­ine mak­ing pump­kin or mush­room soup with­out need­ing cream or milk. Used this way, in­stead of just with boil­ing wa­ter, that sweet­ness might not be very ob­vi­ous.</p>
    <p>SLICED CHEESE</p>
    <p>I think the team should jet­ti­son this. Ta­pi­oca starch and agar agar are added to turn the cheese into slices. The re­sult is that the cheese has a sticky, clay-like tex­ture, but is also gritty. Quite a star­tling feat.</p>
    <p>The team’s re­search shows that con­sumers here are opt­ing for more ex­pen­sive nat­u­ral or un­pro­cessed cheeses, so why of­fer sliced cheese, which is, at best, en­try level?</p>
    <p>I would like to see if it is pos­si­ble to have a soya ver­sion of moz­zarella, some­thing that would melt con­vinc­ingly on a pizza. I imag­ine peo­ple who are lac­tose in­tol­er­ant would ap­pre­ci­ate that.</p>
