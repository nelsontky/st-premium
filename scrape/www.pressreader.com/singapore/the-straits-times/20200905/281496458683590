    <p>Small-scale live per­for­mances will be held at se­lected venues from Sept 11, the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil (NAC) said in an ad­vi­sory is­sued on Thurs­day evening.</p>
    <p>Tri­als have been sched­uled at venues man­aged by the NAC, Es­planade, Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Orches­tra (SCO), Sin­ga­pore Sym­phony Orches­tra (SSO), Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Cul­tural Cen­tre and Arts House. This is a cau­tious step to­wards the re­open­ing of live per­for­mance venues, which have been closed since March 26 in a bid to curb the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Not all the tri­als will be open to the pub­lic, and au­di­ences are to be capped at 50. Min­i­mum dis­tances be­tween au­di­ence mem­bers will be im­ple­mented, and no in­ter­ac­tions be­tween the au­di­ence and per­form­ers or crew will be al­lowed.</p>
    <p>The NAC added in the ad­vi­sory: “We seek the pub­lic’s un­der­stand­ing that the au­di­ence ex­pe­ri­ence for these pilot per­for­mances will dif­fer from pre­vi­ous per­for­mances as a re­sult of the safe man­age­ment mea­sures to en­sure the safety of all in­volved. For ex­am­ple, au­di­ences will have to ob­serve safe dis­tanc­ing and re­frain from con­gre­gat­ing in com­mon spa­ces, not move freely around the venue, and not par­tic­i­pate in the pro­duc­tion (for ex­am­ple, singing or danc­ing) or in­ter­act with the per­form­ers.”</p>
    <p>Safe man­age­ment mea­sures will be im­ple­mented to en­sure lim­ited con­tact be­tween un­masked per­form­ers and crew mem­bers. Larger safe dis­tances will also be put in place when higher-risk ac­tiv­i­ties such as singing or play­ing of wind/brass in­stru­ments are in­volved.</p>
    <p>An NAC spokesman said: “Af­ter Oc­to­ber, the Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth and NAC will mon­i­tor and re­view the out­comes of the pilots to­gether with the par­tic­i­pat­ing cul­tural in­sti­tu­tions and arts prac­ti­tion­ers and we hope to put up rec­om­men­da­tions to the grad­ual re­sump­tion of arts per­for­mances.”</p>
    <p>Al­though arts com­pa­nies were al­lowed to re­sume work and re­hearsals on June 22, live per­for­mances are still pro­hib­ited. Arts com­pa­nies have been suf­fer­ing from box of­fice losses, and cul­ture work­ers have lost in­come dur­ing this pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Cin­e­mas re­opened on July 13, and the arts com­mu­nity has been anx­iously await­ing the re­open­ing of venues.</p>
    <p>The tri­als will help arts com­pa­nies, ser­vice providers and venues clar­ify pro­ce­dures. Mr Chng Hak</p>
    <p>Peng, 47, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Sin­ga­pore Sym­phony Group, said: “We will eval­u­ate the clar­ity of our mea­sures and guide­lines from the au­di­ence per­spec­tive, and the abil­ity of the au­di­ence to en­joy the con­cert ex­pe­ri­ence while feel­ing safe.”</p>
    <p>Tick­ets to the SSO’s trial con­cert fea­tur­ing cham­ber mu­sic by Haydn and Tchaikovsk­y at Vic­to­ria Con­cert Hall on Oct 8 will be on sale via Sis­tic.</p>
    <p>Ms Yvonne Tham, 45, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of the Es­planade, said her team has been work­ing with Sis­tic on a new tick­et­ing sys­tem that can au­to­mat­i­cally “bub­ble wrap” seats, “that is, leav­ing empty seats on the left, right, front and back of the cho­sen seat(s)”.</p>
    <p>The per­form­ing arts venue will be pre­sent­ing three trial per­for­mances on Sept 12, 13 and 23. Ms Tham said:</p>
    <p>“We aimed to have di­ver­sity so that we can have dif­fer­ent con­fig­u­ra­tions on stage and for the au­di­to­rium – to al­low artists and au­di­ences from dif­fer­ent back­grounds the op­por­tu­nity to en­joy this safe pilot.”</p>
    <p>The per­for­mance on Sept 12 by the Orkestra Me­layu Sin­ga­pura at the Out­door The­atre is open to the pub­lic on a first-come, first-served ba­sis, while the Sept 13 event at the Con­cert Hall is by in­vite only. The last per­for­mance by the Sin­ga­pore Dance The­atre at the Es­planade The­atre on Sept 23 will be open to the pub­lic. The free per­for­mance will be tick­eted and have as­signed seat­ing. De­tails will be re­leased on Sis­tic.</p>
    <p>SCO’s ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor Ter­ence Ho, 50, said the orches­tra is ready to re­sume op­er­a­tions, hav­ing worked out lo­gis­tics dur­ing re­hearsals and live-stream per­for­mances in the past weeks.</p>
    <p>He is con­fi­dent of meet­ing the “whole check­list” of re­quire­ments, rang­ing from front of house man­age­ment to safety mea­sures both on and off the stage, for its two tri­als on Sept 11 and 12.</p>
    <p>He added: “It is an­other step to­wards bring­ing au­di­ences back into halls.”</p>
