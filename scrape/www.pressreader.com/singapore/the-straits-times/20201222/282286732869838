    <p>Within five years, an in­de­fati­ga­ble will­ing­ness to try new things has taken Ms Rika Lim, 29, from the bot­tom rung of the gam­ing in­dus­try to be­ing a men­tor and role model for women in the tech­nol­ogy in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>In 2015, want­ing to try her hand at a de­sign-ori­ented role in game de­vel­op­ment, she ap­plied for an en­vi­ron­men­tal artist po­si­tion at French gam­ing firm Ubisoft’s Sin­ga­pore arm.</p>
    <p>She did not get that job, but was of­fered an­other role – as a level de­signer.</p>
    <p>“Level de­sign is a very spe­cialised role and I had al­ways had the thought of be­ing able to fo­cus on some­thing in my work,” said Ms Lim (left), who pre­vi­ously stud­ied game de­sign at the DigiPen In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy. “So I took the op­por­tu­nity and, in the end, it worked out be­cause I also man­aged to work on a lot of hands-on stuff.”</p>
    <p>Level de­sign­ers can be thought of as the land­scap­ers of the gam­ing in­dus­try, re­spon­si­ble for ar­rang­ing the dif­fer­ent vis­ual el­e­ments in a game’s three-di­men­sional en­vi­ron­ment so that each can thrive and con­trib­ute to a qual­ity ex­pe­ri­ence for the player.</p>
    <p>It was a role that Ms Lim found she could ex­cel in, and she has since worked on sev­eral en­tries in Ubisoft’s flag­ship As­sas­sin’s Creed fran­chise, in­clud­ing the lat­est in­stal­ment, As­sas­sin’s Creed Val­halla, which was re­leased last month.</p>
    <p>Two years ago, she was asked if she wanted to make the step up to lead the team of level de­sign­ers she was part of.</p>
    <p>“That wasn’t some­thing that had crossed my mind then, but I thought, ‘Life is about try­ing new things and see­ing how it flows and works for you,’” she said.</p>
    <p>“The com­pany al­lowed me to ease into the job and pro­vided me with a lot of train­ing for things like how to man­age the team so that each of them gets the chance to build his or her pro­file up as well.”</p>
    <p>She now over­sees about 15 level de­sign­ers work­ing in three Ubisoft stu­dios – in Sin­ga­pore, Chengdu and Santa Rosa in the Philip­pines. Of th­ese, only two are women. Ac­cord­ing to mar­ket re­search por­tal Statista, women make up about a quar­ter of the global gam­ing in­dus­try’s work­force.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim said she has not had to go out of her way to prove her­self in the male-dom­i­nated en­vi­ron­ment, and has re­ceived much guid­ance from more ex­pe­ri­enced col­leagues.</p>
    <p>This has in­flu­enced one of her fe­male team mem­bers to aspire to­wards be­ing a team lead, while more of her peers are be­gin­ning to move into man­age­rial roles.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been try­ing to help (my col­league) by shar­ing the ma­te­rial from train­ing ses­sions I at­tend, for ex­am­ple,” said Ms Lim.</p>
    <p>“I don’t see it as me lead­ing and her fol­low­ing, be­cause we’re both work­ing to­wards the same goal.</p>
    <p>“I feel like we are slowly getting to the point where ladies are step­ping up and show­ing what they’re re­ally ca­pa­ble of.</p>
