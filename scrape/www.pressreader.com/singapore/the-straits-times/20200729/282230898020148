    <p>NEW YORK • The ath­letes who would have rep­re­sented the United States at the 1980 Olympics in Moscow are an older crew now, two gen­er­a­tions re­moved from miss­ing what for some was a once-in-a-life­time chance in the spot­light.</p>
    <p>Some are re­tired or semi-re­tired from their post-ath­letic ca­reers. Some are grand­par­ents. Life has hap­pened.</p>
    <p>And yet no one in a position of author­ity has ever made a for­mal apol­ogy for what even Pres­i­dent Jimmy Carter, who or­dered the Amer­i­can boy­cott to protest the Soviet in­va­sion of Afghanista­n, has said was a mis­take.</p>
    <p>Olympic Games past and present are on a lot of minds, since the Tokyo Games would have been go­ing on now had they not been post­poned un­til next year be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>So on July 19, the 40th an­niver­sary of the open­ing cer­e­mony of the Moscow Games, the chief ex­ec­u­tive of the US Olympic and Par­a­lympic Com­mit­tee (USOPC), Sarah Hir­sh­land, posted a let­ter that came aw­fully close to an apol­ogy.</p>
    <p>In the let­ter, ad­dressed to “the ath­letes of the 1980 US Olympic team,” she wrote: “It’s abun­dantly clear in hind­sight that the de­ci­sion to not send a team to Moscow had no im­pact on the global pol­i­tics of the era and in­stead only harmed you – Amer­i­can ath­letes who had ded­i­cated them­selves to ex­cel­lence and the chance to rep­re­sent the US.</p>
    <p>“We can clearly state you de­served bet­ter. You de­served the sup­port of an in­spired na­tion, to be cel­e­brated for rep­re­sent­ing our coun­try with pride and ex­cel­lence.”</p>
    <p>Her let­ter came af­ter for­mer vi­cepres­i­dent Wal­ter Mon­dale de­liv­ered a par­tial apol­ogy.</p>
    <p>“I think we did the right thing,” Mon­dale told The Wall Street Jour­nal in April. But I’m sorry about how it hurt them.”</p>
    <p>The ef­fect has been mixed. For some ath­letes, there was a de­gree of ap­pre­ci­a­tion, but as Benn Fields, the US cham­pion in the high jump that year, put it, “It’s a lit­tle too late, 40 years later.”</p>
    <p>That is not the fault of Hir­sh­land, who has been in her job for just two years.</p>
    <p>Also, the USOPC, which pro­moted the 1980 ath­letes re­cently on TeamUSA.org, con­sid­ers them</p>
    <p>Olympians, though the In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee does not.</p>
    <p>The 1980 boy­cott was the re­sult of sev­eral months of ul­ti­ma­tums and ul­ti­mately failed ne­go­ti­a­tions af­ter Pres­i­dent Carter be­gan to push hard for it early that year.</p>
    <p>The USOPC dared not defy the pres­i­dent, who tried to gar­ner sup­port from as many al­lies as pos­si­ble. Ul­ti­mately dozens of coun­tries, in­clud­ing Canada, Sin­ga­pore and West Ger­many, joined the boy­cott.</p>
    <p>But in the decades since, most in­ter­na­tional sports of­fi­cials and many po­lit­i­cal lead­ers have fought to dis­cour­age Olympic boy­cotts, ar­gu­ing they merely sac­ri­fice an ath­lete’s right to com­pete and make a liv­ing, and do not lead to changes in pol­icy.</p>
    <p>Some of the ath­letes did not see the Hir­sh­land let­ter, which was posted on the USOPC web­site and Twit­ter, and also dis­trib­uted by the or­gan­i­sa­tion’s alumni group.</p>
    <p>But it turns out 40 years has helped heal some scars.</p>
    <p>“I haven’t seen the let­ter, and I’ve moved on from 1980,” Renaldo Nehemiah, 61, a for­mer world record­holder in the 110m hur­dles who was con­sid­ered a favourite for gold in Moscow said.</p>
    <p>“No words can change his­tory. For­tu­nately, 1980 didn’t de­fine me or my ca­reer.”</p>
    <p>Nehemiah did not wait for 1984, de­cid­ing in­stead to pur­sue a ca­reer in the Na­tional Foot­ball League at a time when the Olympics were ba­si­cally an am­a­teur-only af­fair and train­ing four more years meant pass­ing on earn­ing in­come.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers did wait.</p>
    <p>Steve Scott, who ran the mile, and Ed­win Moses, the 400m hur­dles cham­pion, com­peted at the 1984 and 1988 Games. Tracy Caulkins picked up three gold medals in swim­ming in 1984.</p>
    <p>And yet even for those who got an­other chance, miss­ing 1980 still sticks in their craw, and Hir­sh­land’s let­ter was some­thing of a salve.</p>
    <p>The win­ning time in Moses’ ab­sence in the event in Moscow was 48.70sec, more than a sec­ond slower than the win­ning time he ran in 1976.</p>
    <p>“I could have done a cart­wheel at the end of the race in 1980 and still won,” said Moses, 64, who also re­ceived a per­sonal let­ter from Su­sanne Lyons, the chair of the USOPC, ac­knowl­edg­ing the un­for­tu­nate de­ci­sions of 1980.</p>
    <p>“I ap­pre­ci­ated that,” he said of the let­ter.</p>
    <p>I haven’t seen the let­ter, and I’ve moved on from 1980. No words can change his­tory. For­tu­nately, 1980 didn’t de­fine me or my ca­reer. ’’</p>
