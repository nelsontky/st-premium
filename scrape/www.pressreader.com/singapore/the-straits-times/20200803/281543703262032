    <p>South Korean star Ji Chang-wook (be­low) may be a fa­mous ac­tor in real life, but he wants to try work­ing at a con­ve­nience store – just like Dae-hyun, his char­ac­ter in ro­man­tic com­edy Back­street Rookie. He re­veals that as a young man, he used to buy ex­pir­ing but still ed­i­ble food from con­ve­nience stores.</p>
    <p>Though he is a fa­mous ac­tor in real life, South Korean star Ji Chang­wook says he wants to try work­ing at a con­ve­nience store – just like Dae­hyun, his char­ac­ter in ro­man­tic­com­edy Back­street Rookie.</p>
    <p>“I did some train­ing at the head of­fice of a con­ve­nience store be­fore shoot­ing. I ac­tu­ally want to go to the con­ve­nience store and ex­pe­ri­ence work­ing part-time for a few days as well, but my sit­u­a­tion doesn’t al­low me to do that. I will def­i­nitely try if I have the chance in the fu­ture,” says the 33-year-old.</p>
    <p>He re­veals in an e-mail in­ter­view with The Straits Times that as a young man, he too, used to buy ex­pir­ing but still ed­i­ble food from con­ve­nience stores back when he had a friend who was a con­ve­nience store em­ployee.</p>
    <p>Ji says: “Con­ve­nience stores pro­vide a space for chance meet­ings and, in a way, closes the gap be­tween peo­ple. There are so many warm sto­ries that take place in a con­ve­nience store.”</p>
    <p>In the se­ries cur­rently air­ing on stream­ing plat­form iQiyi, Ji is the ro­man­tic part­ner to child star­turned-lead­ing lady Kim Yoo-jung, who plays Jung Saet-byul, an em­ployee Ji’s char­ac­ter hires to take over the store’s night shift.</p>
    <p>The 20-year-old, who de­buted in 2003 and is best known for her roles in Moon Em­brac­ing The Sun (2012) and Love In The Moon­light (2016), says of her lat­est role: “On the sur­face, she looks ca­pa­ble, en­er­getic and hot-tem­pered, but in­side, she is re­ally kind. Although she has ex­pe­ri­enced many dif­fi­cul­ties in life, she still has a lot of faith in her­self and faces ev­ery­thing bravely.”</p>
    <p>For Ji, whose good looks of­ten land him dap­per, dash­ing ro­man­tic roles, the hap­less Dae-hyun is a bit of a de­par­ture.</p>
    <p>Call­ing his char­ac­ter “re­ally awk­ward” and “ridicu­lous but lovely”, he says: “He doesn’t have very suave and tal­ented char­ac­ter­is­tics like a typ­i­cal male lead in an idol drama, but he gives off a friendly and com­fort­able aura, sort of like your neigh­bour, and be­comes charm­ing even­tu­ally in his own way.”</p>
    <p>He adds: “He is in­de­ci­sive but very faith­ful, like a puppy.”</p>
    <p>Kim has her chal­lenges too – her char­ac­ter is skilled in street-fight­ing and the drama’s ex­ag­ger­ated and comedic fight scenes of­ten por­tray her as su­per­nat­u­rally strong.</p>
    <p>She says: “I didn’t have a very long time to pre­pare be­fore shoot­ing the ac­tion scenes, but I spent a lot of time prac­tis­ing. I am pretty good at sports, so it was not that tir­ing. In fact, I found it very fun.”</p>
    <p>While both Ji and Kim shied away from an­swer­ing ques­tions re­lated to the drama’s con­tro­versy – it re­ceived a warn­ing from the South Korean au­thor­i­ties for air­ing provoca­tive scenes, in­clud­ing one in which a high-school age Saet­byul kisses Dae-hyun – Ji says the cast had a happy time on set.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause the script was very funny, we al­ways laughed out loud to­gether when shoot­ing. It was very re­lax­ing and pleas­ant on set.”</p>
