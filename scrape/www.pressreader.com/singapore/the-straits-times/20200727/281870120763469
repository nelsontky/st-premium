    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • A Ro­hingya mi­grant is feared to be the only sur­vivor from a boat car­ry­ing at least two dozen asy­lum seek­ers that is be­lieved to have run into dif­fi­culty off the Malaysian coast near Thai­land, a coast guard of­fi­cial said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Mo­hamad Zawawi Ab­dul­lah, coast guard chief for the north­ern Malaysian states of Kedah and Perlis, said the 27-year-old mi­grant, named Nor Hos­sain, was de­tained by po­lice af­ter he swam to shore on the re­sort is­land of Langkawi.</p>
    <p>“Based on in­for­ma­tion from the po­lice, the il­le­gal Ro­hingya mi­grant had jumped off the boat that had 24 other peo­ple and he was the only one who man­aged to swim to the shore safely,” Mr Zawawi said.</p>
    <p>A search and res­cue op­er­a­tion was launched, but another of­fi­cial said no bod­ies or sur­vivors were found.</p>
    <p>It is not clear what hap­pened to the boat.</p>
    <p>Mus­lim-ma­jor­ity Malaysia is a favoured des­ti­na­tion for the Ro­hingya, who face per­se­cu­tion in their mostly Bud­dhist home­land of Myan­mar. But the au­thor­i­ties have in re­cent months been try­ing to stop them from en­ter­ing over coronaviru­s fears.</p>
    <p>Many of the 700,000-plus Ro­hingya Mus­lims who fled a mil­i­tary crack­down in Myan­mar three years ago have at­tempted to leave over­crowded refugee camps in Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar dis­trict on boats headed for Malaysia and neigh­bour­ing In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>Mr Zawawi said two coast guard air­craft and two boats have been de­ployed to search the sus­pected area.</p>
    <p>Malaysia has stepped up mar­itime pa­trols since the out­break of Covid-19, in an at­tempt to stop Ro­hingya boats from land­ing.</p>
    <p>Although some have made it ashore, many boats have been turned back, spark­ing anger from rights groups.</p>
