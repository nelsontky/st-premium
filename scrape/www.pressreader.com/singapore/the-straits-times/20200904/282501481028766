    <p>NEW YORK • At most wed­dings, all eyes are typ­i­cally on the bride and groom.</p>
    <p>But for so­cial me­dia in­flu­encers, the au­di­ence is mag­ni­fied by the thou­sands.</p>
    <p>“Their day just hap­pens to have a few ex­tra hun­dred thou­sand eye­balls on it, with each step down the aisle and cut of the cake,” said Ms Caila Quinn, an in­flu­encer with nearly 400,000 In­sta­gram fol­low­ers.</p>
    <p>“Your l oved ones might j udge you, but also the en­tire world might.”</p>
    <p>Ms Quinn, 28, lives in New York City and stepped into the spotlight when she ap­peared on Sea­son 20 of The Bach­e­lor, which aired in 2016, and went on to be­come a so­cial me­dia con­tent cre­ator.</p>
    <p>Now she is get­ting mar­ried. She met Nick Bur­rello, 28, a real es­tate pri­vate eq­uity i nvestor i n New York, in 2017 through a mu­tual friend and got en­gaged in Jan­uary this year.</p>
    <p>They are plan­ning two wed­dings next year – in Lake Como, Italy, on May 29, and in her home­town, Cleve­land, on July 17.</p>
    <p>She has been tak­ing her fol­low­ers along on the wed­ding-plan­ning ride and plans to show­case her wed­ding as well.</p>
    <p>But even be­fore so­cial me­dia, cou­ples have felt the need to cre­ate a dream wed­ding day.</p>
    <p>“Wed­ding and bridal mag­a­zines and those images have been with us since the 1930s and I’m sure be­fore that in some other for­mat,” said Dr Jo­ce­lyn Char­nas, a clin­i­cal psy­chol­o­gist in New York.</p>
    <p>“Those as­pi­ra­tional i mages of how a day is sup­posed to look or be have been float­ing around for so long now, it’s nor­malised this idea of ‘the best day of your life’.”</p>
    <p>The way in­flu­encers doc­u­ment their wed­ding plan­ning makes it seem ef­fort­less and fun.</p>
    <p>But in re­al­ity, that is not al­ways an ac­cu­rate de­pic­tion. Dr Char­nas said the stress and cost for other cou­ples try­ing to live up to un­re­al­is­tic ex­pec­ta­tions seen on so­cial me­dia can be “in­tense”.</p>
    <p>Of course, so­cial me­dia of­ten does not tell the en­tire wed­ding story.</p>
    <p>Ms Sharleen Joynt, a New York­based opera singer and in­flu­encer who mar­ried Mr An­drew Levine, 48, an owner of a nat­u­ral prod­ucts com­pany, in 2017 in New York, feels that her sta­tus added an ex­tra layer of stress and work to her wed­ding day.</p>
    <p>“Ul­ti­mately, I saved money but spent time, en­ergy, stress. It was a trade-off,” she said.</p>
    <p>“I think I would have rather spent a lit­tle more money and saved on some of the stress.”</p>
    <p>She said her de­ci­sion to lever­age her so­cial me­dia fol­low­ing to save money – she es­ti­mates she saved 40 per cent of what the wed­ding would have ended up cost­ing – un­in­ten­tion­ally led her to have an “in­flu­encer wed­ding”.</p>
    <p>She hired a pub­lic re­la­tions com­pany to help se­cure part­ner­ships for her wed­ding.</p>
    <p>The firm also rep­re­sented sev­eral wed­ding ven­dors, she noted, and she “got a ton of pres­sure from them to go with their ven­dors”.</p>
    <p>She had promised many of the ven­dors ex­po­sure on UsWeekly.com.</p>
    <p>But af­ter the wed­ding, she was sur­prised to learn she would also get a two-page spread in the print edi­tion that would men­tion four ven­dors.</p>
    <p>When one that had given her a dis­count in ex­change for cov­er­age on UsWeekly.com found out it was not listed in print, it sent her a “scathing” e-mail, she said, and charged her for what it claimed were “dam­ages” to the rentals.</p>
    <p>Many peo­ple prob­a­bly as­sume that in­flu­encers get their en­tire wed­dings comped in ex­change for so­cial me­dia pro­mo­tion.</p>
    <p>But Ms Sam Ozku­ral Du­ral, 29, a YouTu­ber and so­cial me­dia in­flu­encer, said she paid for al­most her en­tire wed­ding.</p>
    <p>The only items she got from brands, she said, were brides­maids dresses and a pair of shoes.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t want to owe any­body any­thing or be in­flu­enced by what was be­ing of­fered to me for free or dis­counted,” she said.</p>
    <p>“I just knew that I wanted it my way.”</p>
    <p>Plus, she added, she wanted to avoid crit­i­cism from her fol­low­ers. She and Mr Jarod Du­ral, a 30-yearold mort­gage bro­ker, de­cided to get mar­ried rather quickly be­cause her grand­mother was in the hospice and she hoped to have her at the wed­ding.</p>
    <p>When she shared with her fol­low­ers that she would get mar­ried in De­cem­ber last year, within a few months of get­ting en­gaged, “that’s when I saw hate com­ing in”.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple were com­ment­ing on her priv­i­lege to be able to af­ford to have a wed­ding only a few months af­ter get­ting en­gaged.</p>
    <p>In­flu­encers who make deals with ven­dors still pay for some wed­ding ser­vices, in ex­change for fea­tures on their so­cial me­dia plat­forms.</p>
    <p>These part­ner­ships, though, can turn the wed­ding day into a work­day. On top of all the typ­i­cal wed­ding stress, there is ex­tra pres­sure in mak­ing sure cou­ples meet all the agree­ments’ obli­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>“I made an en­tire list for our pho­tog­ra­pher of ev­ery­thing that needed to be pho­tographed,” in­flu­encer and Ohio bride Kelsey Pear­son said.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers, like Ms Quinn, hire some­one with a “part­ner­ships check­list” to man­age the agree­ments and pho­tos re­quired.</p>
    <p>Many of the cou­ples said that be­cause most of their wed­ding pho­tos will be taken, edited and shared on so­cial me­dia any­way, why not get some­thing out of it.</p>
    <p>For the Pear­sons, there was an­other rea­son they were so in­tent on shar­ing their day with the world.</p>
    <p>“For me, I could never pic­ture my wed­ding day grow­ing up be­cause I was fig­ur­ing my­self out,” Ms Pear­son said.</p>
    <p>“And maybe there are young girls that were like me or any aged per­son who’s strug­gling with their sex­ual orientatio­n or iden­tity, if they can see a healthy re­la­tion­ship and a wed­ding that’s be­ing cel­e­brated with love all around them is pos­si­ble, I wanted to share that.”</p>
