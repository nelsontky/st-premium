    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has, over the past year, forced coun­tries to im­pose lock­downs and close their bor­ders, lead­ing to a drop in public events and gath­er­ings as well as a sharp slow­down in travel.</p>
    <p>These have meant that, for the most part, ex­trem­ist ter­ror­ism has dropped off the head­lines and seen a dip in im­pact.</p>
    <p>But the threat has not re­ceded, as in­ci­dents like the be­head­ing of school­teacher Sa­muel Paty in France and the re­cent ar­rests of ter­ror op­er­a­tives and dis­cov­ery of new train­ing sites in In­done­sia show.</p>
    <p>Twenty years af­ter the Sept 11, 2001 ter­ror at­tack by Al-Qaeda on the United States and the dis­cov­ery of re­gional ter­ror net­work Je­maah Is­lamiah (JI), there is a need to be alert to three broad trends on the ter­ror front.</p>
    <p>One, a resur­gence of tra­di­tional ter­ror or­gan­i­sa­tions like JI.</p>
    <p>Two, a spike in rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion as peo­ple spend more time on­line.</p>
    <p>Three, new mutations of ter­ror.</p>
    <p>JI RESUR­GENCE</p>
    <p>In its hey­day around 2001, JI had a pres­ence in Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia, In­done­sia, the Philip­pines and Aus­tralia and was plan­ning at­tacks in the Repub­lic when mem­bers of a lo­cal cell were ar­rested.</p>
    <p>Since then, se­cu­rity ac­tions in Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia have de­stroyed its net­works in both coun­tries, and fur­ther ar­rests in In­done­sia fol­low­ing the 2002 Bali bomb­ings that killed more than 200 peo­ple have dec­i­mated much of its lead­er­ship. Its links with Al-Qaeda were also dis­rupted.</p>
    <p>But a num­ber of its lead­ers and bomb mak­ers re­main on the run, long af­ter the group was banned in 2008. And they have not shifted from its aim of es­tab­lish­ing an Is­lamic state in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Last year, its emir or leader Para Wi­jayanto was sen­tenced by a Jakarta court to seven years’ jail for his role in re­cruit­ing, train­ing and rais­ing funds for mil­i­tants go­ing to Syria. In the past two months, two key bomb mak­ers in­volved in the 2002 Bali blasts – Tau­fik Bu­laga, alias Upik Lawanga, and Aris Su­mar­sono, alias Zulka­r­naen – were also ar­rested in In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>Al­to­gether, the In­done­sian police last year have ar­rested more than 30 mil­i­tants linked to JI.</p>
    <p>While these re­cent ar­rests of key play­ers have helped neu­tralise the threat, they have also high­lighted a wor­ry­ing con­cern: The group has evolved and ex­panded its reach.</p>
    <p>On the one hand, it main­tains its mil­i­tant lean­ings. On the other, it is try­ing to gain a greater foothold in the public sphere to win sup­port for its even­tual aim.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this week, The Straits Times re­ported on the dis­cov­ery of a two-storey house in Cen­tral Java that was used by JI to train re­cruits in han­dling weapons and as­sem­bling bombs. At least 96 young mil­i­tants un­der­went train­ing there, with many go­ing to</p>
    <p>Syria to fight along­side ter­ror group Al-Nusra Front.</p>
    <p>While there was no in­di­ca­tion of planned ac­tiv­ity in the re­gion, an­a­lysts say it can­not be ruled out.</p>
    <p>Ter­ror­ists have ex­plored at­tacks on Sin­ga­pore tar­gets on sev­eral oc­ca­sions over the past decade.</p>
    <p>In 2010, In­done­sian police re­cov­ered a map of Sin­ga­pore with Or­chard MRT sta­tion cir­cled on it from a ter­ror sus­pect killed dur­ing a raid.</p>
    <p>In 2011, mil­i­tant Abu Umar dis­closed plans to at­tack Sin­ga­pore­ans leav­ing the Sin­ga­pore em­bassy in Jakarta.</p>
    <p>In 2016, the au­thor­i­ties that broke up a mil­i­tant cell in Batam found that its leader was plan­ning a rocket at­tack on Ma­rina Bay with Syr­ian-based, In­done­sian Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) mil­i­tant Bahrun Naim.</p>
    <p>These in­stances un­der­line why se­cu­rity agen­cies con­tinue to be on high alert dur­ing fes­tive oc­ca­sions and ma­jor events.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the re­cent and up­com­ing release of detained mil­i­tants, in­clud­ing JI spir­i­tual leader Abu Bakar Bashir, is a key source of con­cern, as some are set on re­turn­ing to their old ways.</p>
    <p>The JI’s in­fra­struc­ture re­mains re­silient too.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian police in­ves­ti­ga­tions into re­cently detained mil­i­tants in­di­cate that they have been de­ploy­ing char­ity boxes at mini-mar­kets in parts of the coun­try to get the public to un­wit­tingly fund ter­ror ac­tiv­i­ties. JI mem­bers are also run­ning busi­nesses, in­clud­ing oil palm plan­ta­tions and clean­ing ser­vice con­trac­tors, to fi­nance ter­ror ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>A key part of JI’s in­fra­struc­ture is its net­work of pe­santren or board­ing schools that has re­mained ac­tive in prop­a­gat­ing its hard-line teach­ings, and where many of its mil­i­tants were nur­tured in re­cent decades.</p>
    <p>These deep-rooted net­works are ex­cep­tion­ally re­silient and al­most never die, noted se­cu­rity an­a­lyst Noor Huda Is­mail, a vis­it­ing fel­low at the S. Ra­jarat­nam School of In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies, who has been help­ing to re­ha­bil­i­tate rad­i­cals, in­clud­ing for­mer JI mem­bers. He is es­pe­cially con­cerned that their ex­clu­sivist and sec­tar­ian world view could be nor­malised as the group’s changed tack wins wider ac­cep­tance.</p>
    <p>Key JI ide­o­logue Abu Rus­dan has em­pha­sised that the group will pur­sue its goals through preach­ing and religious out­reach rather than armed vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>It main­tains sev­eral web­sites, is ac­tive on so­cial me­dia, par­tic­i­pates in the­o­log­i­cal de­bates on on­line dis­cus­sion fo­rums and sup­ports var­i­ous humanitari­an char­i­ties help­ing vic­tims of dis­as­ters and con­flicts, the Aus­tralian Strate­gic Pol­icy In­sti­tute noted in a re­cent re­port.</p>
    <p>JI has also been ac­tively re­cruit­ing mem­bers in uni­ver­si­ties and back­ing po­lit­i­cal causes, once a no-go area for its el­ders who see democ­racy as anath­ema and dis­cour­aged mem­bers from tak­ing part in the sys­tem, such as by vot­ing or sup­port­ing politi­cians.</p>
    <p>While the tra­jec­tory of how this will play out in the com­ing years re­mains un­cer­tain, it is set to have an im­pact on the re­gion’s se­cu­rity land­scape for some time to come.</p>
    <p>COVID-19 RAD­I­CALS</p>
    <p>Early last year, the ar­rival of Covid-19 ap­peared to have in­stilled a new op­ti­mism among the Mu­jahidin of East­ern In­done­sia, or MIT, in Cen­tral Su­lawesi.</p>
    <p>The ter­ror group’s leader Ali</p>
    <p>Kalora believed the virus was di­vine ret­ri­bu­tion against</p>
    <p>China for its treat­ment of the Uighurs, and against other ma­jor economies that bat­tled ISIS, which MIT had sworn al­le­giance to, the In­sti­tute for Pol­icy Anal­y­sis of Con­flict noted. This con­fi­dence spurred a se­ries of at­tacks on po­lice­men and police in­for­mants in the prov­ince, footage of which was up­loaded on so­cial me­dia groups in a bid to win new re­cruits.</p>
    <p>Even though ISIS’ self-de­clared caliphate in Syria has been dis­man­tled, the threat of ter­ror­ism has not abated. ISIS and Al-Qaeda have framed the pan­demic as di­vine ret­ri­bu­tion against the West, and urged fol­low­ers through so­cial me­dia to carry out at­tacks.</p>
    <p>They have not hes­i­tated to cap­i­talise on de­vel­op­ments to win re­cruits. Af­ter French mag­a­zine Char­lie Hebdo re­pub­lished car­i­ca­tures of Prophet</p>
    <p>Muham­mad in Septem­ber, France saw a spate of ter­ror­ist at­tacks – in­clud­ing the be­head­ing of the teacher by an 18-year-old who had been in touch with a mil­i­tant in Syria via In­sta­gram. There were also at­tacks against French and Western in­ter­ests in Saudi Ara­bia and Aus­tria, and an uptick in ter­ror­ist rhetoric on­line.</p>
    <p>The wors­en­ing climate prompted Sin­ga­pore’s Home Team to be on height­ened alert, in a bid to pre-empt copy­cat at­tacks. A Home Af­fairs Min­istry spokesman said: “With many peo­ple spend­ing more time on­line dur­ing the pan­demic, this has in­ad­ver­tently in­creased their ex­po­sure to rad­i­cal ideas.”</p>
    <p>As at late Novem­ber, in­ves­ti­ga­tions into 37 in­di­vid­u­als – 14 Sin­ga­pore­ans and 23 for­eign­ers – had been ini­ti­ated for sus­pected rad­i­cal in­cli­na­tions and com­ments that could in­cite vi­o­lence or stoke com­mu­nal un­rest. While many had made posts sup­port­ing the be­head­ing, sev­eral had made deroga­tory com­ments against Mus­lims. None posed an im­mi­nent threat.</p>
    <p>The ex­cep­tion was a 26-year-old Bangladesh­i con­struc­tion worker, who has since been detained un­der the In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity Act. Rad­i­calised in 2018, he shared pro­pa­ganda sup­port­ing armed vi­o­lence in Syria and had bought knives for at­tacks on Hin­dus in Bangladesh.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, there are con­cerns that other side ef­fects of the pan­demic – such as iso­la­tion and de­pres­sion aris­ing from long lock­downs and job losses – could make in­di­vid­u­als more sus­cep­ti­ble to rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The Fi­nan­cial Times last month re­ported that far right-wing ex­trem­ists have gained ground, re­cruit­ing teenagers un­der­go­ing home­school­ing through means like video gam­ing. One new on­line game in Ger­many even awarded play­ers points for shoot­ing phi­lan­thropist Ge­orge Soros and Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel.</p>
    <p>TER­ROR MUTATIONS</p>
    <p>Ex­perts noted that just as groups like ISIS re­main a threat, on­line rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion has also en­abled vi­o­lent ex­trem­ism to as­sume new forms, as the rise of white su­prem­a­cists in Amer­ica and Europe and anti-Mus­lim vi­o­lence in parts of Asia have shown.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Union’s counter-ter­ror­ism co­or­di­na­tor</p>
    <p>Gilles de Ker­chove re­cently warned of the emer­gence of these new forms of ter­ror. He cited techno­pho­bia, which has seen 5G phone masts be­ing burned and telco of­fices be­ing at­tacked by ac­tivists op­posed to 5G net­works.</p>
    <p>He is also con­cerned about in­creas­ingly vi­o­lent ecol­o­gist and an­i­mal rights groups, some of whom might be­lieve they need to use vi­o­lence to wake gov­ern­ments up on global warm­ing.</p>
    <p>Far-left ex­trem­ism could also see an uptick as in­equal­ity widens in the wake of the cri­sis, he feared.</p>
    <p>Some ex­trem­ists have even pro­moted Covid-19 con­spir­acy the­o­ries to win a fol­low­ing, say­ing the virus is a hoax by gov­ern­ments and the vac­cine causes autism.</p>
    <p>Last week, Bri­tain’s head of counter-ter­ror­ism polic­ing Neil Basu warned that these con­spir­acy the­o­ries could rad­i­calise a small mi­nor­ity to vi­o­lence. “No one is say­ing that no one has the right to voice an opin­ion; it is where that opin­ion be­comes an in­cite­ment to vi­o­lence and ha­tred,” he told the In­de­pen­dent news­pa­per. His big­gest con­cern – one shared by many – is that on­line rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion has al­lowed all these the­o­ries, and var­i­ous forms of ter­ror­ism, to now thrive 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in­ter­na­tion­ally.</p>
    <p>While it may be too early to get a full pic­ture of the im­pact of Covid-19 on ter­ror re­cruit­ment and rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion, one thing is clear: The virus hasn’t quite muted the ter­ror threat, but po­ten­tially mul­ti­plied its reach and it could well see new mutations.</p>
