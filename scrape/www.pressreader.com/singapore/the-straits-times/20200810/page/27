        HOME B7 THE STRAITS TIMES MONDAY, AUGUST 10, 2020 | | | A NATION’S PLEDGE SPECIAL CELEBRATIO­N Because of Covid-19, we face many difficulti­es and inconvenie­nces in our daily lives; I thought that NDP will be cancelled. To be able to celebrate NDP is special in these tough times... and I can still see my favourite fireworks display. ’’ PUPIL KRISTEL LAM, 10. TRIUMPH OF THE PEOPLE This year’s NDP theme is a reflection point of what we have triumphed over these 55 years. Sars, economic recession and now Covid-19, to name a few. I am proud to say that what sets us apart as a tiny red dot on the map is the people. ’’ MS ERIYANA SUBADI, 34, senior staff nurse at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. GREAT WAY TO CELEBRATE NDP to me means coming together with fellow Singaporea­ns, and while I missed the crowd at the Padang or Marina Bay, I still think this was a great way to celebrate. ’’ JUNISE NEO, 15, a student, who was a spectator at the evening show at The Star Performing Arts Centre. COMMUNITY EVENT This year’s NDP is special because it’s a community NDP, celebrated (in) and brought to the heartland across the country, and it’s a celebratio­n by the people, for the people. ’’ MR JOHANN ANNUAR, 46, executive director of non-profit organisati­on Engineerin­g Good.
