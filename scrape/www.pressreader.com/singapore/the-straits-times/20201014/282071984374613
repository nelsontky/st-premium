    <p>Am­bu­lance Wish Sin­ga­pore is the lo­cal chap­ter of a char­ity, Am­bu­lance Wish Foun­da­tion, started by an am­bu­lance driver in the Nether­lands to grant ter­mi­nally ill pa­tients their last wish.</p>
    <p>The group was reg­is­tered as a char­ity here in March and has granted 14 wishes so far.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore chap­ter was started by Ms Carol Wee, an ad­min­is­tra­tor in the health sec­tor, who roped in a group of like-minded peo­ple, in­clud­ing pal­lia­tive care physi­cian Ong Yew Jin.</p>
    <p>Dr Ong, who chairs Am­bu­lance Wish Sin­ga­pore, said: “Each pa­tient’s wish re­quest is dif­fer­ent and spe­cial, rang­ing from ful­fill­ing a dream to com­plet­ing un­fin­ished busi­ness.”</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, it helped a 46-year-old breast can­cer pa­tient ful­fil her last wish of mak­ing her home more pre­sentable.</p>
    <p>Her chil­dren had scrib­bled and drawn on the walls and doors when they were young, and she had hoped for a home makeover so they would not feel em­bar­rassed to in­vite their friends over, Dr Ong said.</p>
    <p>So, Am­bu­lance Wish’s vol­un­teers painted the flat and gave her some fur­ni­ture in July. The woman died last month.</p>
    <p>Another wish granted was a 61-year-old can­cer pa­tient and her hus­band’s trip to the zoo in Au­gust. She had last vis­ited the zoo when she was a 10-yearold, and had fond mem­o­ries of the at­trac­tion.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the zoo trip, the char­ity took the cou­ple to lunch at Arbora Hill­top Din­ing at Mount Faber and cre­ated a scrap­book for her with pic­tures of her day at the zoo.</p>
