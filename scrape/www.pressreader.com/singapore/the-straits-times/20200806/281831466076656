    <p>Con­gress politi­cian Sai­fud­din Soz was talk­ing to tele­vi­sion re­porters last week from be­hind the bound­ary wall of his house in Sri­na­gar when he was dragged away by the se­cu­rity per­son­nel who were guard­ing him.</p>
    <p>This oc­curred just af­ter the gov­ern­ment of In­dia had told the Supreme Court that Mr Soz, 82, was not un­der house ar­rest or de­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>The dis­qui­et­ing in­ci­dent, with Mr Soz main­tain­ing he was al­lowed out of the house only on rare oc­ca­sions, trained the fo­cus on Kash­mir’s politi­cians and the lack of a po­lit­i­cal process in Jammu and Kash­mir since it lost spe­cial sta­tus a year ago.</p>
    <p>Over 400 Kash­miri politi­cians and sep­a­ratists were ini­tially de­tained or ar­rested in what the gov­ern­ment claimed was a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure to pre­vent any up­heaval over the re­moval of Kash­mir’s spe­cial sta­tus or Ar­ti­cle 370 on Aug 5 last year.</p>
    <p>Spe­cial sta­tus in­cludes the ex­clu­sive rights for res­i­dents to own land and get gov­ern­ment jobs.</p>
    <p>Only two dozen politi­cians now re­main in de­ten­tion but the po­lit­i­cal space in Kash­mir re­mains frac­tured.</p>
    <p>Among the most high-pro­file de­tainees is Ms Me­hbooba Mufti, a former ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and former chief min­is­ter of the state of Jammu and Kash­mir. Ms Mufti, the leader of the Jammu and Kash­mir Peo­ples Demo­cratic Party, is de­tained un­der the J&K Pub­lic Safety Act.</p>
    <p>“I feel like the In­dian gov­ern­ment wants to make an ex­am­ple out of her and the mes­sage to the peo­ple of Jammu and Kash­mir is that if you ex­press dis­sent on Ar­ti­cle 370 or you speak against this move, then you have the ex­am­ple of a chief min­is­ter who has been be­hind bars for a year,” Ms Iltija Mufti, the politi­cian’s 32-year-old daugh­ter, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The younger Ms Mufti said the PDP (Peo­ples Demo­cratic Party), along with the Na­tional Con­fer­ence, the other Kash­miri main­stream party, were a “bridge be­tween the peo­ple of Jammu and Kash­mir with the rest of the coun­try”.</p>
    <p>She said it was an im­por­tant role for a state mired in con­flict. “When you re­move that bridge, you have ob­vi­ously young im­pres­sion­able men grav­i­tat­ing to­wards mil­i­tancy and that is a recipe for dis­as­ter.”</p>
    <p>Kash­mir has been at the cen­tre of an armed sep­a­ratist up­ris­ing which has led to the deaths of hun­dreds of thou­sands of civil­ians, se­cu­rity forces and mil­i­tants over the last few decades.</p>
    <p>Both In­dia and Pak­istan claim Kash­mir, parts of which rest in each other’s ter­ri­to­ries, in its en­tirety.</p>
    <p>In­dia ac­cuses Pak­istan, which de­nies the al­le­ga­tion, of feed­ing the sep­a­ratist mil­i­tancy that has fu­elled in­sta­bil­ity and vi­o­lence in Kash­mir.</p>
    <p>The po­lit­i­cal process in Kash­mir, even be­fore the re­moval of its spe­cial sta­tus, was hemmed in by the spec­tre of vi­o­lence and voter turnout has been low in elec­tions.</p>
    <p>In the 2019 gen­eral elec­tions, voter turnout in Sri­na­gar, the cap­i­tal of Jammu and Kash­mir, for in­stance, was a mere 14.43 per cent</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal an­a­lysts said Kash­miri main­stream politi­cians now faced the dou­ble whammy of re­assess­ing their po­lit­i­cal po­si­tion­ing and reach­ing out to a pop­u­lace even more deeply alien­ated.</p>
    <p>“The main­stream lead­er­ship has been weak­ened and marginalis­ed. Their free­doms have been cur­tailed through dif­fer­ent ways by de­ten­tion or house ar­rest,” said Dr Noor Ah­mad Baba of the De­part­ment of Pol­i­tics and Gov­er­nance, Cen­tral Univer­sity of Kash­mir.</p>
    <p>“They are de­fen­sive. They are also ques­tion­ing the very foun­da­tion of their pol­i­tics. If they don’t talk of Ar­ti­cle 370... they be­come ir­rel­e­vant.”</p>
