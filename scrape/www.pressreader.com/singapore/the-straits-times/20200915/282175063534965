    <p>Cathay Pa­cific Air­ways is still burn­ing through as much as HK$2 bil­lion (S$352 mil­lion) a month and will con­tinue to do so un­til the mar­ket re­cov­ers from the coro­n­avirus crisis, the car­rier said yes­ter­day as it re­ported dis­mal Au­gust traf­fic fig­ures and re­it­er­ated the need to re­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>“We are weath­er­ing the storm for now, but the fact re­mains that we sim­ply will not sur­vive un­less we adapt our air­lines for the new travel mar­ket,” chief cus­tomer and com­mer­cial of­fi­cer Ron­ald Lam said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“A re­struc­tur­ing will there­fore be in­evitable to pro­tect the com­pany, the Hong Kong avi­a­tion hub, and the liveli­hoods of as many peo­ple as pos­si­ble,” Mr Lam said.</p>
    <p>A HK$39 bil­lion re­cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion plan com­pleted last month bought the com­pany some time, but “it is an in­vest­ment that we need to re­pay”, he said.</p>
    <p>Cathay, which last month re­ported a first-half net loss of HK$9.9 bil­lion, is un­der­go­ing a strate­gic re­view. Rec­om­men­da­tions on the fu­ture shape and size of the air­line group, which in­cludes Cathay Dragon and HK Ex­press, are due to be pre­sented to the board in the fourth quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Cathay and Cathay Dragon flew only 35,773 pas­sen­gers last month, a slump of 98.8 per cent from the same month last year. Rev­enue pas­sen­ger km fell 98.1 per cent and pas­sen­ger load fac­tor dropped 60 per­cent­age points to 19.9 per cent, the com­pany said yes­ter­day. The group car­ried 102,122 tonnes of cargo, down 36.7 per cent from Au­gust last year. “It is clear that we are fac­ing a long and un­cer­tain road to re­cov­ery,” Mr Lam said.</p>
    <p>With few signs of im­prove­ment, bar a pickup on some ser­vices thanks to stu­dent traf­fic to the United King­dom and the lift­ing of a ban on tran­sit flights from main­land China, Cathay has low­ered its op­er­at­ing pas­sen­ger flight ca­pac­ity to about 10 per cent for this month and the next.</p>
    <p>“Pas­sen­ger de­mand con­tin­ued to be very weak as new waves of Covid-19 in our key mar­kets damp­ened over­all travel sen­ti­ment,” Mr Lam said. “With no new des­ti­na­tions be­ing re­sumed in Au­gust, we saw only min­i­mal in­crease in pas­sen­ger flight ca­pac­ity.”</p>
    <p>Cathay’s shares slipped 0.3 per cent in Hong Kong trade yes­ter­day. The stock has tum­bled 38 per cent this year.</p>
