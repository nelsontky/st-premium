    <p>Two weeks ago, The Sun­day Times re­ported on a dif­fi­cult de­ci­sion that pup­pet mas­ter Frankie Yeo made – to sell his beloved pup­pets to pay his mount­ing bills.</p>
    <p>Since then, sev­eral ST read­ers have come for­ward to buy his “ba­bies” and give them a new home.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo, whose stage name is Frankie Malachi, has been per­form­ing with pup­pets and mar­i­onettes for more than 20 years. But with live per­for­mances can­celled dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, the chil­dren’s par­ties and com­pany events he once per­formed at were no more.</p>
    <p>Since the ar­ti­cle’s pub­li­ca­tion, the 57-year-old has sold seven more pup­pets, mostly cost­ing $400 each.</p>
    <p>They in­clude four yel­low bunny pup­pets, two blue hand pup­pets, and a jug­gling blue bear mar­i­onette.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo also re­ceived many phone calls, SMS, What­sApp and Face­book mes­sages – from friends, clients and strangers alike – ex­press­ing con­cern for him.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean says: “I feel very heart­ened and touched by the sup­port read­ers have shown me and my craft.</p>
    <p>“I know those who bought my pup­pets likely did not have the need for them – they prob­a­bly just wanted to sup­port me.”</p>
    <p>Even those who did not make a pur­chase en­cour­aged him not to feel dis­heart­ened dur­ing these dif­fi­cult times. “To me, this means a lot.”</p>
    <p>One buyer was an old friend, Mr William Wong, 37, who runs Magic Cas­tle Sin­ga­pore, a shop at Or­chard Plaza sell­ing magic tricks, props and ac­ces­sories. He bought a bunny pup­pet for $400 and in­tends to dis­play it in his shopfront.</p>
    <p>He says: “I have heard of Frankie and his pup­pets since I was in sec­ondary school, way be­fore we be­came friends. Pup­petry is a lost art and there aren’t many peo­ple do­ing it in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“I wanted to sup­port him and hope he can con­tinue pur­su­ing his craft.”</p>
    <p>ST reader Mark Seow, 37, bought the jug­gling blue bear mar­i­onette, which he now dis­plays at home.</p>
    <p>Although the bank em­ployee has never had any ex­pe­ri­ence han­dling pup­pets, he was fas­ci­nated by them af­ter see­ing a few movies from the Pup­pet Mas­ter film fran­chise in the 1990s.</p>
    <p>He says: “Read­ing about Frankie reignited an old in­ter­est. And Frankie’s pup­pets are very well­made and life-like. To me, they are more like mu­si­cal in­stru­ments than toys.”</p>
    <p>He al­lows his son Silas, five, and daugh­ter Ce­line, two, to play with the pup­pet, un­der su­per­vi­sion, of course. In his free time, he, too, prac­tises mak­ing it move and dance.</p>
    <p>“It is not easy mak­ing the bear jug­gle. It looks ef­fort­less dur­ing a show, but it is hard when you are the one pulling the strings.”</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo, who is the cre­ative di­rec­tor of home-grown com­pany Mas­cots and Pup­pets Spe­cial­ists, is still sell­ing his pup­pets.</p>
    <p>He says: “Apart from the read­ers’ re­ac­tions, I was also very en­cour­aged when I read that some live per­for­mances might be al­lowed soon. I hope at least some small-scale shows can re­sume soon, as I think it will re­ally ben­e­fit peo­ple in the arts com­mu­nity.”</p>
