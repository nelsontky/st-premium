    <p>NEW YORK • Of the eight pre­vi­ous Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) games the Brook­lyn Nets have played be­fore Thurs­day, Kyrie Irv­ing and Kevin Du­rant have scored team-high points in all but one of them.</p>
    <p>Both of t hem were ab­sent against the Philadel­phia 76ers but the Nets did not miss them much, even if they were play­ing against a team who were on top of the league.</p>
    <p>Joe Har­ris led with 28 points as the short-handed Brook­lyn snapped Philadel­phia’s (7-2) fiveg­ame win­ning streak with a 122-109 win on Thurs­day to im­prove to 5-4.</p>
    <p>Caris LeVert added 22 points and had 10 as­sists as the Nets cooled off the NBA’s hottest team de­spite miss­ing their two top play­ers.</p>
    <p>“We are a to­tally dif­fer­ent team when those guys are out here,” guard LeVert said. “But I think we’ve done a great job of hav­ing a next-man-up men­tal­ity, guys step­ping into those roles and ful­fill­ing what we need as a team.”</p>
    <p>Du­rant sat out due to Covid-19 pro­to­cols and Irv­ing missed the game due to “per­sonal rea­sons”.</p>
    <p>Nets coach Steve Nash said be­fore the game that Irv­ing’s ab­sence sur­prised him and he was un­sure of the exact is­sue.</p>
    <p>“I sent him a mes­sage in the last half-hour and haven’t heard back yet,” he said. “But ob­vi­ously think­ing about him and hope that all is well. It’s a pri­vate mat­ter.”</p>
    <p>Nash did say that Du­rant, who had to quar­an­tine af­ter pos­si­ble Covid-19 ex­po­sure, could re­turn to­mor­row when they host the Ok­la­homa City Thun­der.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Har­ris got the job done, fin­ish­ing two points shy of his ca­reer high as the Nets posted their sec­ond straight dou­ble-digit win.</p>
    <p>LeVert, who started in place of Irv­ing, made the most of his op­por­tu­nity. He scored 18 points by half­time as the Nets shot 45.4 per cent and scored 35 points off 20 Philadel­phia turnovers.</p>
    <p>“When we play con­nected and we have that fight­ing spirit, we give our­selves a great chance ev­ery night no mat­ter who’s avail­able,” Nash said.</p>
    <p>Stars Joel Em­biid and Ben Sim­mons had a quiet night for the 76ers. Em­biid scored 20 points on seven-of-14 shoot­ing while Sim­mons had just 11 points.</p>
    <p>Shake Mil­ton started in place of the in­jured Seth Curry and led the Sixers with 24 points and seven as­sists.</p>
    <p>Curry, who made the trip with the team, was re­ported af­ter the game to have tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus, forc­ing the Sixers to re­main overnight in New York so they can con­duct fur­ther test­ing to see if the virus has spread to any of the other play­ers.</p>
    <p>The 76ers are sched­uled to play to­day, when they host the Den­ver Nuggets.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier on Thurs­day, the NBA and the play­ers’ union an­nounced that of 498 play­ers tested for Covid-19 since Dec 30, four had re­turned pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>In Los An­ge­les, LaMar­cus Aldridge had 28 points to lead the San An­to­nio Spurs past the Lak­ers 118-109.</p>
    <p>DeMar DeRozan, who man­aged just six points in San An­to­nio’s win over the Los An­ge­les Clip­pers on Tues­day, had 19 points and eight as­sists.</p>
    <p>De­jounte Mur­ray con­trib­uted 18 points and eight boards and Rudy Gay had 15 points for the Spurs (4-4), who snapped the Lak­ers’ four-game win­ning streak.</p>
    <p>Patty Mills fin­ished with 10 points. LeBron James had 27 points, 12 as­sists and six re­bounds, while An­thony Davis col­lected 23 points, 10 re­bounds and three blocks for the hosts, who dropped to 6-3.</p>
    <p>I think we’ve done a great job of hav­ing a next-man-up men­tal­ity, guys step­ping into those roles and ful­fill­ing what we need as a team.</p>
