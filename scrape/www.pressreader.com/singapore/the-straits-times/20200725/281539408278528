    <p>United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has con­flated the dif­fer­ent forms of vi­o­lence in US cities as well as calls from the left to de­fund the po­lice fol­low­ing killings of African Amer­i­cans at the hands of po­lice. But his claims of how Democrats want to de­stroy sub­urbs are a bid to scare vot­ers, an­a­lysts say.</p>
    <p>To lis­ten to the nar­ra­tive of cer­tain right-wing tele­vi­sion hosts with tens of mil­lions of view­ers, Amer­ica’s cities are in flames and its sub­urbs are un­der threat of de­struc­tion from an­ar­chist mobs who hate their own coun­try.</p>
    <p>Yet in Port­land, Ore­gon, which saw the first in­flux of fed­eral agents kit­ted out like para­mil­i­tary forces, only a part of the city’s down­town area, and a few po­lice build­ings in an­other area, have been af­fected.</p>
    <p>In other cities where fed­eral agents have been de­ployed de­spite may­ors’ con­cerns, the prob­lem is not left­ist mobs, but mostly gang-re­lated vi­o­lence – not un­fa­mil­iar in the long-ne­glected, pre­dom­i­nantly African-Amer­i­can ar­eas of cities like Chicago.</p>
    <p>But Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has con­flated the dif­fer­ent forms of vi­o­lence as well as calls from the left to de­fund the po­lice – though not echoed by his pre­sump­tive Demo­cratic Party ri­val Joe Bi­den – fol­low­ing killings of African Amer­i­cans at the hands of po­lice.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, with a ref­er­en­dum loom­ing in just over three months, is fac­ing an eco­nomic re­cov­ery that is at best stut­ter­ing.</p>
    <p>Data re­leased on Thurs­day showed un­em­ploy­ment claims in­creased last week for the first time in nearly four months. The Labour Depart­ment re­ported more than 1.4 mil­lion new ap­pli­ca­tions for state ben­e­fits, up from about 1.3 mil­lion in the pre­vi­ous two weeks.</p>
    <p>Si­mul­ta­ne­ously, the Covid-19 pan­demic is rag­ing in sev­eral states, forc­ing Mr Trump to try and seize con­trol of the nar­ra­tive by restart­ing daily Covid-19 task force brief­ings him­self.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, he an­nounced that the Repub­li­can Party was can­celling plans to hold its an­nual con­ven­tion in Florida next month.</p>
    <p>To top it all, poll af­ter poll still show him trail­ing Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>The larger po­lit­i­cal agenda, an­a­lysts say, is to frighten Amer­i­cans into vot­ing for him.</p>
    <p>Killings in Chicago this sum­mer have been “worse than Afghanista­n, by far”, Mr Trump said on Tues­day. In­deed, Chicago’s homi­cide rate per 100,000 peo­ple is higher than Afghanista­n’s, but only if one dis­counts war fa­tal­i­ties in Afghanista­n.</p>
    <p>On July 16, Mr Trump said: “They (the Demo­cratic Party) wanted to de­fund and abol­ish your po­lice and law en­force­ment while at the same time de­stroy­ing our great sub­urbs.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple on the far left… want to see the sub­urbs de­stroyed... Peo­ple have worked all their lives to get into a com­mu­nity, and now they’re go­ing to watch it go to hell.”</p>
    <p>The sub­urbs are par­tic­u­larly im­por­tant po­lit­i­cally be­cause they are not Mr Trump’s strength. He did win nar­rowly in the sub­urbs in 2016, but since then his poll fig­ures there have sunk, with mul­ti­ple polls show­ing Mr Bi­den with, in some cases, a dou­ble-digit lead. Port­land is a dis­tinc­tive case. It has long had is­sues with po­lice vi­o­lence, and a tra­di­tion of protest which is both or­ganic and or­gan­ised. As in some other cities, the weeks-long Black Lives Mat­ter protests did in­volve some prop­erty dam­age, but ac­quired a more vi­o­lent edge in part pro­voked by the ar­rival this month of fed­eral agents from the Depart­ment of Home­land Se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>“Ob­ject throw­ing, fire set­ting, graf­fiti – all that in­creased dra­mat­i­cally af­ter fed­eral au­thor­i­ties ar­rived,” pro­fes­sor of crim­i­nol­ogy and crim­i­nal jus­tice Edward Maguire of Ari­zona State Univer­sity told Vox.com.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think any­body can make the ar­gu­ment that the fed­eral au­thor­i­ties came to town and made things bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>The agents used non-lethal weapons in­clud­ing tear gas and foam-coated bul­lets, and have dragged pro­test­ers away and into un­marked cars. That drew even more pro­test­ers out, in­clud­ing sub­ur­ban mothers singing “Hands up, don’t shoot” – only for them, too, to be tear-gassed.</p>
    <p>Cor­nell Univer­sity’s pro­fes­sor of Amer­i­can stud­ies Glenn Altschuler told The Straits Times that Mr Trump is “try­ing to scare the hell out of the Amer­i­can peo­ple… that crime, loot­ing, an­ar­chy and de­struc­tion are ram­pant and grow­ing”.</p>
    <p>He added: “If he is suc­cess­ful and can craft a nar­ra­tive that Amer­ica needs law and or­der im­posed by the fed­eral gov­ern­ment, then the strat­egy may work. But it’s a long shot. I would say it is a mark of some­one who is thrash­ing about a bit for a po­lit­i­cal strat­egy that will nar­row the gap be­tween him­self and his op­po­nent.”</p>
