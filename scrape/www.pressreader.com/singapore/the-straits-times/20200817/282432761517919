    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • For decades, young and cre­ative peo­ple have come to Los An­ge­les with vi­sions of fame, for­tune and ful­fil­ment. Over the past year, dozens of TikTok stars have had the rare ex­pe­ri­ence of be­com­ing overnight house­hold names, of­ten liv­ing in one of the many so-called col­lab houses that have formed over the last year. Sev­eral of them have leases that are signed or co-signed by tal­ent man­age­ment com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>But the pic­ture is not al­ways so sunny and many have learnt that get­ting dis­cov­ered is not so easy.</p>
    <p>There are sev­eral es­tab­lished man­age­ment com­pa­nies that work with in­flu­encers across the so­cial me­dia land­scape. Many formed in step with the in­flu­encer econ­omy in the 2010s, sign­ing tal­ent from YouTube and In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>More re­cently, a class of bou­tique firms has emerged to guide the ca­reers of TikTok’s young stars. Ms Ari­adna Jacob founded In­flu­ences in 2018, the same year TikTok merged with Mu­si­cal.ly. The com­pany’s web­site names brands like Dis­ney, Coca-Cola and John­son & John­son among its clients.</p>
    <p>By Jan­uary this year, fi­nan­cial and busi­ness news web­site Busi­ness In­sider had named In­flu­ences and Ms Jacob one of the top creator man­agers, and the com­pany was work­ing with some of the most no­table in­flu­encers on TikTok, in­clud­ing Charli and Dixie D’Ame­lio. Also among Ms Jacob’s clients at the time was Brit­tany Tom­lin­son, whom Ms Jacob had ap­proached after a video of her re­ac­tion to a taste of kom­bucha went vi­ral.</p>
    <p>“Ari DMed me on Twit­ter and was like, ‘I’m see­ing this im­age of you go­ing around a lot, have you made any money?’” Tom­lin­son, 22, said. She said that Ms Jacob told her she owned an ad agency and could get her a deal with a kom­bucha brand. All Tom­lin­son needed to do was a sign a con­tract. Tom­lin­son signed a non-ex­clu­sive agree­ment with Ms Jacob in Au­gust last year. A month later, she signed a new con­tract, mak­ing the ar­range­ment ex­clu­sive.</p>
    <p>In De­cem­ber, Tom­lin­son moved to Los An­ge­les. She had started do­ing brand deals for com­pa­nies such as FabFitFun and GT’s Kom­bucha and even filmed a Su­per Bowl com­mer­cial for Sabra hum­mus with Charli D’Ame­lio.</p>
    <p>“By Jan­uary, I re­alised I hadn’t been paid since Hal­loween,” she said. Tom­lin­son reached out to the brands she had worked with and dis­cov­ered that she was owed tens of thou­sands of dol­lars.</p>
    <p>In April, she filed a com­plaint with the Cal­i­for­nia Labour Com­mis­sion, on the grounds that Ms Jacob had vi­o­lated Cal­i­for­nia law by op­er­at­ing as a tal­ent agency without a li­cence. In it, she claims Ms Jacob is with­hold­ing US$23,683.82 (S$32,465.78) in fees.</p>
    <p>“She tries to lock cre­ators into con­tracts,” said Tom­lin­son, who is now man­aged by Brill­stein En­ter­tain­ment Part­ners. Her case re­mains pend­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Jacob got her start in so­cial me­dia and mar­ket­ing. In a state­ment to The New York Times, she said that she en­tered the busi­ness to help young peo­ple with big ideas.</p>
    <p>She also said she wanted to pro­tect cre­ators from mis­takes in the in­dus­try – “the ugly part of Hol­ly­wood”.</p>
    <p>“None of the cre­ators who have left In­flu­ences were ever harmed,” she said in the state­ment. “In­stead some re­ceived free rent, a spot on a Su­per Bowl com­mer­cial, trips on jets, pri­vate es­tates, pro­fes­sional pub­li­cists and men­tor­ing from the best in the busi­ness. None of them have yet been sued and we have not hin­dered any of their ca­reers in any way what­so­ever.”</p>
    <p>Tianna Singer, 19, moved into the Girls in the Val­ley house, which was man­aged by Ms Jacob, in late May. “She promised brand deals, money and op­por­tu­ni­ties,” Singer said. “Ev­ery­one was promised in­come, but that never hap­pened.”</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the house said that Ms Jacob asked them to cre­ate free branded con­tent and put a lot of pres­sure on them. “She would show up at all times of the night,” Singer said. “She’d come as late as 1am, and she’d be tex­ting us un­til 3am and show back up at 10am.”</p>
    <p>The cre­ators in the house said that on June 7, Ms Jacob told them they would be thrown out if they did not post on so­cial me­dia at least eight times a day. “We were of­ten very in­tim­i­dated by Ari be­cause the con­ver­sa­tions be­came ex­plo­sive,” said Singer.</p>
    <p>In mid-June, she and oth­ers left the house. They had a ver­bal fight with Ms Jacob which re­sulted in sev­eral calls to lo­cal au­thor­i­ties to in­ter­vene. In an e-mail from her lawyer, Ms Jacob de­nied that a fight took place.</p>
    <p>Mr Justin McWash­ing­ton, 24, the live-in house man­ager for the Girls in the Val­ley, said that the next day, he moved out. “These houses look like they’re all sun­shine and rain­bows and gum­drops,” he said, “but at the end of the day, it’s toxic.”</p>
    <p>By the time Singer was un­pack­ing her bags at the Girls in the Val­ley house, her mother, Salam Singer, was al­ready ner­vous. She wanted to give her daugh­ter some au­ton­omy, but wor­ried about the con­tract Tianna had signed and the amount of over­sight Ms Jacob would be pro­vid­ing.</p>
    <p>She de­scribed Ms Jacob’s be­hav­iour in the end as “shame­ful”.</p>
    <p>“It’s a very preda­tory en­vi­ron­ment,” Ms Singer said of the in­dus­try. “You have a sit­u­a­tion where you have young vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple with the po­ten­tial to ac­cess a lot of money, then you have older peo­ple who are go­ing to take ad­van­tage of the sit­u­a­tion. Tianna’s not go­ing to be the first or the last.”</p>
