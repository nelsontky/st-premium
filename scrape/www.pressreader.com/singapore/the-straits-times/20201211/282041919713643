    <p>The N-level re­sults will be re­leased next Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Ar­range­ments have been made for school can­di­dates to re­ceive their re­sults in their class­rooms or on­line be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>This was an­nounced by the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion and the Sin­ga­pore Ex­am­i­na­tions and As­sess­ment Board (SEAB) in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Only school can­di­dates col­lect­ing their re­sults will be al­lowed entry into the school premises and they will be ex­pected to ob­serve the safe man­age­ment mea­sures in place,” said the state­ment.</p>
    <p>Students who are un­well, un­der quar­an­tine or stay-home no­tice, or on leave of ab­sence on the day the re­sults are re­leased, should not re­turn to school.</p>
    <p>In­stead, they may view their re­sults on­line at the SEAB’s web­site from 2.30pm next Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Can­di­dates who have a SingPass ac­count can use it to ac­cess the</p>
    <p>SEAB’s on­line re­sults re­lease sys­tem, which will be ac­ces­si­ble un­til Dec 31.</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional students can ac­cess the sys­tem us­ing an SEAB-is­sued per­sonal iden­ti­fi­ca­tion num­ber sent to their e-mail ad­dresses which their schools have pro­vided to the board.</p>
    <p>N-level can­di­dates may also ap­point a proxy to col­lect their re­sults on their be­half. If they are un­able to do so, they can con­tact their school for fur­ther as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>Pri­vate can­di­dates will have their re­sults mailed to the ad­dress they have pro­vided to the SEAB.</p>
    <p>There will also be sim­i­lar ar­range­ments for pri­vate can­di­dates to check their re­sults on­line.</p>
    <p>Those ap­ply­ing for In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion (ITE) cour­ses can sub­mit their ap­pli­ca­tions on­line via the ITE web­site be­tween next Thurs­day, 2.30pm, and Dec 21, 5pm.</p>
    <p>Those who wish to fill up a hard­copy ap­pli­ca­tion form can do so at cus­tomer and vis­i­tor cen­tres at the three ITE Col­leges in Ang Mo Kio, Choa Chu Kang and Simei.</p>
    <p>How­ever, they must first book an ap­point­ment at their prospec­tive ITE Col­lege by phone or email.</p>
    <p>Students who are el­i­gi­ble for the Di­rect Entry Scheme to Polytech­nic Pro­gramme (DPP) will re­ceive in­vi­ta­tions to ap­ply for it.</p>
    <p>The DPP en­ables students to progress to se­lected polytech­nic diploma cour­ses via a two-year Higher Nitec course at the ITE.</p>
    <p>DPP and ITE post­ing re­sults will be re­leased on Dec 23 and Dec 30 re­spec­tively, through the ITE ap­pli­ca­tion por­tal.</p>
    <p>Can­di­dates with ITE of­fers should ac­cept or re­ject the of­fer be­tween Dec 30 and Jan 4 next year, while those who have re­ceived the DPP re­sults should do so be­tween Dec 23 and Dec 28.</p>
    <p>After the re­lease of the N-level re­sults, students may con­sult their teach­ers, or ed­u­ca­tion and ca­reer guid­ance coun­sel­lors in their schools, on their next steps.</p>
    <p>They can also visit the MySkill­sFu­ture web­site to find out about the ed­u­ca­tion and ca­reer path­ways avail­able to them.</p>
