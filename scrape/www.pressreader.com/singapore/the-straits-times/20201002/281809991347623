    <p>NEW DELHI • Coro­n­avirus su­per­spread­ers were be­hind the ex­plo­sion of Covid-19 in In­dia, the coun­try with the most cases af­ter the US, re­searchers said.</p>
    <p>A group of pa­tients that in­cluded about 8 per cent of In­dia’s con­firmed cases later led to al­most two-thirds of its to­tal in­fec­tions, sci­en­tists said Wed­nes­day in a study pub­lished in the jour­nal Sci­ence.</p>
    <p>The re­search, based on trac­ing more than three mil­lion con­tacts in the south­ern states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu through Aug 1, is the first ma­jor study of trans­mis­sion in a de­vel­op­ing coun­try.</p>
    <p>While most re­search on the pan­demic has come from China, Europe and North Amer­ica, cases are now bur­geon­ing in In­dia and other de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, ac­cord­ing to re­searchers led by Dr Ra­manan Laxmi­narayan, di­rec­tor of the Cen­tre for Dis­ease Dy­nam­ics, Eco­nomics and Pol­icy, who wrote the study.</p>
    <p>Bar­ri­ers to health­care are greater in these na­tions, and the risk of get­ting se­verely ill and dy­ing from Covid-19 is higher, they said.</p>
    <p>“We’ve never had this de­gree of in­for­ma­tion to say, hey, some peo­ple are re­ally trans­mit­ting the virus in a mas­sive way,” Dr Laxmi­narayan said in an in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>In con­trast with the su­per­spreader mi­nor­ity, 71 per cent of con­firmed cases whose con­tacts were traced were not found to have spread the virus to any­one.</p>
    <p>A na­tion­wide sero­log­i­cal sur­vey showed that one in 15 In­di­ans has been ex­posed to the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Hos­pi­tals in sev­eral states are now strug­gling to se­cure med­i­cal oxy­gen, needed to as­sist pa­tients with trou­ble breath­ing on their own.</p>
    <p>Data for the Sci­ence study was gath­ered by thou­sands of con­tact trac­ers dur­ing In­dia’s lock­down, when mass gath­er­ings were banned, schools were closed and peo­ple were or­dered to wear face masks in pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Al­most 130 mil­lion peo­ple live in the two In­dian states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, ac­count­ing for about 10 per cent of the coun­try’s pop­u­la­tion. In­dia has recorded more than 6.2 mil­lion Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>Both states re­ported their first Sars-CoV-2 in­fec­tions on March 5. Health work­ers traced as many as 80 con­tacts per con­firmed case, us­ing skills and re­sources honed from rou­tinely track­ing po­ten­tial trans­mit­ters of HIV and tu­ber­cu­lo­sis, Dr Laxmi­narayan said.</p>
    <p>Pro­lific Sars-CoV-2 trans­mit­ters tended to spread the virus dur­ing pro­longed close con­tact on buses and other forms of trans­porta­tion, ac­cord­ing to the re­searchers, who were also from Prince­ton Univer­sity, Johns Hop­kins Bloomberg School of Pub­lic Health and In­dian state govern­ments.</p>
    <p>In such set­tings, there was a 79 per cent chance of an in­fec­tion oc­cur­ring. That com­pares with only a one in 40 chance of catch­ing the virus from some­one in the com­mu­nity who was not a house­hold mem­ber, Dr Laxmi­narayan said.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren un­der 14, though, were found to be fre­quent “silent” spread­ers of the virus, es­pe­cially to their par­ents and peers.</p>
    <p>“This shows that even without schools be­ing func­tional, chil­dren-to-chil­dren trans­mis­sion seems to be quite im­por­tant,” he said. “As ter­ri­ble as it is to say – with two kids at home my­self – it’s ac­tu­ally im­por­tant to keep the kids home.”</p>
    <p>In con­trast with the su­per-spreader mi­nor­ity, 71 per cent of con­firmed cases whose con­tacts were traced were not found to have spread the virus to any­one. A na­tion­wide sero­log­i­cal sur­vey showed that one in 15 In­di­ans has been ex­posed to the coro­n­avirus.</p>
