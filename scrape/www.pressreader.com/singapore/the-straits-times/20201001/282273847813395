    <p>Italy’s UniCredit has sued Hin Leong Trad­ing over a let­ter of credit, court doc­u­ments show, one of sev­eral the Sin­ga­pore oil trader sought from lenders for oil pur­chases but used to pay debt in­stead.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore High Court doc­u­ments seen by Reuters show the Ital­ian bank has also sued com­mod­ity trad­ing gi­ant Glen­core over the mat­ter. A source fa­mil­iar with the case con­firmed the law­suits had been filed.</p>
    <p>UniCredit and its lawyers Den­tons Rodyk & David­son de­clined to com­ment. Glen­core also de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>Last Novem­ber, Hin Leong, one of Asia’s largest oil traders, re­quested UniCredit fi­nance a De­cem­ber de­liv­ery of about 150,000 tonnes of high-sul­phur fuel oil from Glen­core for US$37.2 mil­lion (S$50.9 mil­lion), the doc­u­ments show.</p>
    <p>But UniCredit, which had ex­tended the trader an US$85 mil­lion credit line that month, said in the court doc­u­ments it was not aware at the time that Hin Leong had a sep­a­rate agree­ment to sell the cargo straight back to Glen­core on the same day.</p>
    <p>The bank said it learnt of this in June 2020, via lawyers, from PwC, which was brought in as ju­di­cial man­ager for Hin Leong af­ter it was un­able to re­pay bank loans of nearly US$4 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>PwC, which did not re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment, said in a re­port in June there were deals in­volv­ing at least 18 let­ters of credit worth about US$503 mil­lion opened by Hin Leong to pur­chase a cargo only to sell it, each time, straight back to the seller si­mul­taneously.</p>
    <p>The let­ter of credit from UniCredit was one of th­ese, PwC told the bank via lawyers.</p>
    <p>“Un­der the sale and buy-back trans­ac­tions, ti­tle to the goods would pass be­tween GSPL (Glen­core) and HLT (Hin Leong) at the same time on 2 De­cem­ber 2019 at 0001 hours,” UniCredit said in the court doc­u­ments, re­fer­ring to the deal it fi­nanced.</p>
    <p>It said the trans­ac­tions ren­dered Hin Leong’s pur­chase “a sham” and “de­prived UCB (UniCredit) of any se­cu­rity over the goods fi­nanced”.</p>
    <p>PwC said in ref­er­ence to the let­ters of credit from lenders that th­ese “trans­ac­tions were not en­tered into for any com­mercial ben­e­fit to the Com­pany (Hin Leong) ex­cept for the sole pur­pose of rais­ing liq­uid­ity to pay loans that were or were be­com­ing due and payable”.</p>
