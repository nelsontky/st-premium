    <p>A $449.6 mil­lion con­tract has been awarded to Si­no­hy­dro Cor­po­ra­tion (Sin­ga­pore branch) to build fa­cil­i­ties such as tanks and struc­tures to treat do­mes­tic used wa­ter at the Tuas wa­ter recla­ma­tion plant.</p>
    <p>It is the fourth ma­jor con­struc­tion con­tract of the Tuas plant awarded by na­tional wa­ter agency PUB. The agency said on Tues­day that Si­no­hy­dro Cor­po­ra­tion will con­struct the civil and struc­tural com­po­nents of the plant’s Do­mes­tic Liq­uids Mod­ules, which will house var­i­ous fa­cil­i­ties such as biosorp­tion tanks and mem­brane biore­ac­tor sys­tems re­quired to treat do­mes­tic used wa­ter.</p>
    <p>The plant’s two Do­mes­tic Liq­uids Mod­ules will have a com­bined treat­ment ca­pac­ity of 650,000 cu­bic me­tres per day – equiv­a­lent to around 245 Olympic-size swim­ming pools of wa­ter. The treated wa­ter will un­dergo fur­ther pu­rifi­ca­tion to pro­duce Ne­wa­ter, and any ex­cess is sent for pro­cess­ing needs or dis­charged into the sea. Con­struc­tion work will start next month and is ex­pected to be com­pleted by 2025.</p>
    <p>As a key com­po­nent of PUB’s Deep Tun­nel Sew­er­age Sys­tem Phase 2 project, the Tuas plant will be equipped to re­ceive both do­mes­tic and in­dus­trial used wa­ter streams from two sep­a­rate tun­nels for treat­ment.</p>
    <p>A total of 14 bids were made for the con­tract dur­ing the open ten­der ex­er­cise in Novem­ber last year. It en­com­passes the civil and struc­tural works for the Do­mes­tic Liq­uids Mod­ules. Sep­a­rate con­tracts will be called to equip the Do­mes­tic Liq­uids Mod­ules with its me­chan­i­cal and elec­tri­cal com­po­nents.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, an­other seven con­struc­tion ten­ders worth $1 bil­lion will be called be­fore the end of next year, in­clud­ing the plant’s In­dus­trial Liq­uids Mod­ules to treat in­dus­trial used wa­ter. The ear­lier three con­struc­tion con­tracts of the Tuas plant were awarded in Jan­uary and July last year and in March this year.</p>
    <p>The first was for site de­vel­op­ment works and the se­cond, for build­ing the Tuas plant’s in­flu­ent pump­ing sta­tions. The third con­tract was to build the plant’s biosolids treat­ment fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>The Tuas plant will be sited next to the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency’s In­te­grated Waste Man­age­ment Fa­cil­ity. To­gether, they will make up Tuas Nexus, an ini­tia­tive which in­te­grates solid waste and used wa­ter treat­ment pro­cesses to im­prove the over­all per­for­mance of the plant, and op­ti­mise land use.</p>
    <p>The Tuas plant will have an ini­tial treat­ment ca­pac­ity of around 800,000 cu­bic me­tres per day, enough to fill more than 300 Olympic-size swim­ming pools.</p>
    <p>Worth about $6.5 bil­lion, Phase 2 of the Deep Tun­nel Sew­er­age Sys­tem will con­vey used wa­ter from the western part of Sin­ga­pore to the Tuas plant for treat­ment.</p>
    <p>It is ex­pected to be com­pleted by 2025, re­plac­ing pro­gres­sively the wa­ter recla­ma­tion plants in Ulu Pan­dan and Jurong.</p>
    <p>The Deep Tun­nel Sew­er­age Sys­tem, a mas­sive un­der­ground sew­er­age su­per­high­way, is the back­bone of Sin­ga­pore’s used wa­ter man­age­ment sys­tem. The first phase of the sys­tem, which cov­ers eastern Sin­ga­pore and chan­nels used wa­ter to the Changi wa­ter recla­ma­tion plant, was com­pleted in 2008.</p>
