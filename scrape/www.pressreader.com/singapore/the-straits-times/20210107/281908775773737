    <p>KHARTOUM • US Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Steven Mnuchin has ar­rived in Su­dan for talks on fu­ture eco­nomic as­sis­tance, fol­low­ing Khartoum’s re­moval from Wash­ing­ton’s black­list of state spon­sors of ter­ror­ism.</p>
    <p>“The United States Trea­sury chief Steve Mnuchin ar­rived to­day morn­ing atop a high-rank­ing del­e­ga­tion, in the first such visit to Su­dan,” a gov­ern­ment state­ment said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Mnuchin had a meet­ing with Prime Min­is­ter Ab­dalla Ham­dok in the cap­i­tal Khartoum, shortly af­ter his ar­rival.</p>
    <p>The Su­danese Premier shared a photo on Twit­ter of the del­e­ga­tion, de­scrib­ing US-Su­dan re­la­tions as tak­ing “his­tor­i­cal leaps to­wards a bet­ter fu­ture”.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can Trea­sury chief also signed a mem­o­ran­dum of un­der­stand­ing with Su­dan’s Act­ing Fi­nance Min­is­ter Heba Mo­hamed Ali on a pre­vi­ously an­nounced bridgeloan fa­cil­ity. That will clear Su­dan’s ar­rears with the World Bank and al­low the im­pov­er­ished coun­try ac­cess to more than US$1 bil­lion (S$1.3 bil­lion) in an­nual lend­ing, her min­istry said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Mnuchin is also sched­uled to meet head of state Gen­eral Ab­del Fat­tah al-Burhan, the state-run SUNA news agency said be­fore the visit.</p>
    <p>Mr Mnuchin’s talks with the lead­ers are ex­pected to fo­cus on Su­dan’s de­te­ri­o­rat­ing “eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion, and US aid to Su­dan and debt re­lief”, the gov­ern­ment had said.</p>
    <p>Su­dan is strug­gling with a chronic hard cur­rency short­age and gal­lop­ing in­fla­tion. The eco­nomic woes have eroded the pur­chas­ing power of all so­cial classes.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s ex­ter­nal debt is es­ti­mated at US$60 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The US on Dec 14 for­mally re­moved Su­dan from its crip­pling black­list as part of a quid pro quo for the mainly Arab coun­try’s nor­mal­i­sa­tion of its re­la­tions with Is­rael.</p>
    <p>Su­dan agreed to the move in Oc­to­ber, but said it would come into force only af­ter its ap­proval by a yet-to-be-formed Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>In re­turn, Wash­ing­ton has ear­marked hun­dreds of mil­lions of dol­lars in aid for Su­dan.</p>
    <p>Su­dan’s Jus­tice Min­istry said the to­tal amount of di­rect and in­di­rect US aid en­vis­aged un­der the deal amounted to US$1.1 bil­lion, in ad­di­tion to an­other “bil­lion dol­lars that the US has com­mit­ted to trans­fer­ring to the World Bank to pay ar­rears Su­dan owes”.</p>
    <p>Su­dan has been un­der­go­ing a rocky po­lit­i­cal tran­si­tion since the army top­pled vet­eran pres­i­dent Omar al-Bashir in April 2019, fol­low­ing months of mass protests against his rule.</p>
    <p>The joint mil­i­tary-civil­ian ad­min­is­tra­tion charged with over­see­ing the tran­si­tion has sought to end the coun­try’s in­ter­na­tional pariah sta­tus by forg­ing closer re­la­tions with the US.</p>
    <p>Prior to Su­dan, Mr Mnuchin was in Egypt, where on Tues­day he dis­cussed with Pres­i­dent Ab­del-Fat­tah el-Sisi the Pales­tinian is­sue and the mega dam that Ethiopia is build­ing on a Nile River trib­u­tary, ac­cord­ing to a state­ment from the Egyp­tian pres­i­dency.</p>
