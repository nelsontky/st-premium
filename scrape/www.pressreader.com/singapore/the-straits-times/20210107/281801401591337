    <p>Barisan Na­sional’s (BN) re­cently­sacked sec­re­tary-gen­eral said yes­ter­day that Umno pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi had sent a let­ter to the Malaysian King sup­port­ing op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim in his at­tempt to be­come prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Zahid was also plot­ting to top­ple the rul­ing Perikatan Na­sional (PN) by ne­go­ti­at­ing with the Chi­ne­se­based Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party (DAP) to form a new gov­ern­ment, said Tan Sri An­nuar Musa.</p>
    <p>“I can con­firm that there was sup­port in black and white given by the Barisan Na­sional chair­man and Umno pres­i­dent for Datuk Seri An­war Ibrahim, to top­ple the rul­ing Perikatan Na­sional (PN),” Mr An­nuar told a news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“I also re­ceived ver­i­fied in­for­ma­tion on the place and date of a pur­ported meet­ing with DAP in an at­tempt to form a new po­lit­i­cal align­ment,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr An­nuar showed the pur­ported let­ter of sup­port for Mr An­war, dated Oct 11, 2020 to the me­dia, a day af­ter he was ousted from his po­si­tion as sec­re­tary-gen­eral in the BN coali­tion.</p>
    <p>He said he had ver­i­fied that it was au­then­tic.</p>
    <p>DAP sec­re­tary-gen­eral Lim Guan Eng re­futed Mr An­nuar’s claims and said any po­lit­i­cal co­op­er­a­tion be­tween Umno and DAP was highly un­likely due to their con­trast­ing ide­olo­gies.</p>
    <p>“Don’t drag us into this. Don’t use us as a pre­text to save your own po­lit­i­cal skin. This is wrong and dis­hon­est,” Mr Lim was quoted as say­ing by the Free Malaysia To­day news web­site.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war, who is pres­i­dent of Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat, had claimed last Septem­ber that he held a strong ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment with the back­ing of more than 120 MPs. How­ever, he never an­nounced their names and his claims fiz­zled out.</p>
    <p>Mr An­nuar re­mains Fed­eral Ter­ri­to­ries Min­is­ter. His dis­missal from his post on Tues­day is be­lieved to have stemmed from his staunch back­ing for Umno’s con­tin­ued col­lab­o­ra­tion with the PN gov­ern­ment, go­ing against Zahid who wants Umno to aban­don the PN coali­tion in or­der to re­main the dom­i­nant Malay party.</p>
    <p>Umno’s an­nual gen­eral meet­ings last week­end saw about three-quar­ters of its di­vi­sions agree­ing to ditch Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia (Ber­satu) and force fresh elec­tions by March.</p>
    <p>It is un­der­stood that Zahid wants Umno’s lead­ers to re­sign from their gov­ern­ment po­si­tions by next month, as part of a push for snap polls.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din was sched­uled to chair a Ber­satu supreme coun­cil meet­ing last night to dis­cuss its co­op­er­a­tion with PN al­lies as well as prepa­ra­tions for elec­tions, while Umno’s supreme coun­cil is also hold­ing its own meet­ing to de­cide whether to re­main in PN and con­tinue work­ing with Ber­satu.</p>
    <p>Umno MP Khairy Ja­malud­din, who is also Science, Tech­nol­ogy and In­no­va­tion Min­is­ter, tweeted yes­ter­day: “Those call­ing for GE (gen­eral elec­tions) be­fore the pan­demic is brought un­der con­trol are ir­re­spon­si­ble. And I know among those ask­ing for a snap gen­eral elec­tion are from my own party. Don’t be self­ish.”</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber, Zahid was crit­i­cised by lead­ers within his own party as well as its al­lies in PN for hav­ing an­nounced his sup­port for Mr An­war.</p>
    <p>On Oct 26, the Umno supreme coun­cil de­clared that it would con­tinue to sup­port the PN gov­ern­ment led by Mr Muhyid­din and re­jected the idea of sup­port­ing ei­ther Mr An­war or the DAP.</p>
    <p>Mr An­nuar’s al­le­ga­tions yes­ter­day came af­ter months of bick­er­ing within the in­creas­ingly shaky rul­ing PN.</p>
    <p>Many Umno lead­ers are un­happy at be­ing given less im­por­tant Cabi­net posts in the 10-month-old PN gov­ern­ment, as lead­ers from Ber­satu were given se­nior min­is­te­rial posts de­spite it be­ing a smaller party than Umno.</p>
    <p>There is also dis­sat­is­fac­tion among Umno lead­ers over sev­eral of their MPs, in­clud­ing Zahid, fac­ing cor­rup­tion charges.</p>
    <p>I can con­firm that there was sup­port in black and white given by the Barisan Na­sional chair­man and Umno pres­i­dent for Datuk Seri An­war Ibrahim, to top­ple the rul­ing Perikatan Na­sional (PN)... I also re­ceived ver­i­fied in­for­ma­tion on the place and date of a pur­ported meet­ing with DAP in an at­tempt to form a new po­lit­i­cal align­ment.</p>
