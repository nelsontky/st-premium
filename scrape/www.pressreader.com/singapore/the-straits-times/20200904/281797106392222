    <p>YAN­GON • Myan­mar has im­posed manda­tory quar­an­tine and coro­n­avirus tests for vis­i­tors to its cap­i­tal Naypy­itaw af­ter the coun­try re­ported dozens more in­fec­tions on Wed­nes­day and leader Aung San Suu Kyi warned of a “disaster for the coun­try”.</p>
    <p>Any­one en­ter­ing the city will be quar­an­tined, tested and al­lowed en­try only if their test re­sult is neg­a­tive, ac­cord­ing to a govern­ment or­der pub­lished on Face­book.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple com­ing from the coun­try’s worst-hit ar­eas will be quar­an­tined in a fa­cil­ity for at least seven days, said the or­der by the Naypy­itaw Coun­cil, while oth­ers will be al­lowed to leave ear­lier if they test neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>Myan­mar re­ported its first lo­cal trans­mis­sion in a month in the mid­dle of last month, in the restive western Rakhine state. Since then, the num­ber of cases has roughly dou­bled to 1,059 in­fec­tions and six deaths, ac­cord­ing to govern­ment data.</p>
    <p>The ma­jor­ity of the cases and deaths have been in Rakhine, where govern­ment troops are fight­ing eth­nic in­sur­gents and the au­thor­i­ties have im­posed sweep­ing curbs on In­ter­net ac­cess.</p>
    <p>Most re­cent in­fec­tions have been in that state’s cap­i­tal Sit­twe, where of­fi­cials have im­posed a stay-at-home or­der and a cur­few. Sit­twe is also home to camps where about 100,000 Ro­hingya Mus­lims have been con­fined since an out­break of vi­o­lence in 2012. Ro­hingya are mostly de­nied cit­i­zen­ship and face strict curbs on move­ment and ac­cess to health­care.</p>
    <p>But in­fec­tions have been found across the coun­try in­clud­ing in the big­gest city, Yan­gon. The au­thor­i­ties im­posed a par­tial lock­down in parts of Yan­gon on Tues­day, or­der­ing res­i­dents of the worst-hit town­ships to stay at home other than for es­sen­tial jour­neys.</p>
    <p>Ms Suu Kyi said those who dis­obeyed in­struc­tions would face pun­ish­ment un­der the Nat­u­ral Disaster Law, which car­ries prison terms of up to a year.</p>
