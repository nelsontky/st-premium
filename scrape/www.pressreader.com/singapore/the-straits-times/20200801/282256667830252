    <p>• The ma­jor Euro­pean economies of France, Spain and Italy suf­fered record con­trac­tions in the sec­ond quar­ter as the im­pact of coro­n­avirus lock­downs and de­pressed do­mes­tic con­sump­tion took its toll.</p>
    <p>France’s econ­omy con­tracted by a record 13.8 per cent in the quar­ter ended June, its na­tional statis­tics in­sti­tute Insee said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The sea­son­ally ad­justed quar­ter-on-quar­ter drop in gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) was bet­ter than fore­cast but worse than the per­for­mance of most of its euro zone peers.</p>
    <p>“GDP’s neg­a­tive de­vel­op­ments in the first half of 2020 is linked to the shut­down of ‘ non-es­sen­tial’ ac­tiv­i­ties in the con­text of the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the lock­down be­tween mid-March and the be­gin­ning of May,” Insee said.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond-quar­ter fig­ure means the French econ­omy has been shrinking for three con­sec­u­tive quar­ters and con­tin­ues to be in re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>Spain plunged into re­ces­sion af­ter its GDP tum­bled by 18.5 per cent, of­fi­cial fig­ures yes­ter­day showed. I n the first quar­ter, growth had fallen by 5.2 per cent, said the coun­try’s In­sti­tute of Na­tional Statis­tics.</p>
    <p>The busi­ness, trans­port and ho­tel sec­tors were all badly hit, suf­fer­ing a 40 per cent drop com­pared with the first quar­ter. And tourism, a pil­lar of the Span­ish econ­omy and which ac­counts for 12 per cent of its GDP, suf­fered a 60 per cent drop in rev­enues com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Spain’s Econ­omy Min­is­ter Na­dia Calvino, the mea­sures taken by the gov­ern­ment to prop up the econ­omy – such as ex­tend­ing its fur­lough scheme, state­spon­sored loans and sub­si­dies for the self-em­ployed – en­abled the coun­try to avoid “a col­lapse in GDP of more than 25 per cent”.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, Italy slipped into re­ces­sion as the coun­try’s na­tional statis­tics bureau Is­tat yes­ter­day re­ported a 12.4 per cent fall in GDP for the sec­ond quar­ter. GDP fell by 17.3 per cent com­pared with the year-ago sec­ond quar­ter, Is­tat said, as the coro­n­avirus lock­down took a dra­matic toll on the euro zone’s third­largest econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The three coun­tries suf­fered sharper GDP shocks com­pared with the record 10.1 per cent fall in Ger­many.</p>
    <p>Aus­tria suf­fered a 10.7 per cent con­trac­tion and Bel­gium 12.2 per cent. Por­tu­gal also re­ported yes­ter­day that its GDP shrank 14.1 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter, mark­ing the big­gest con­trac­tion ever recorded.</p>
    <p>A his­toric €750 bil­lion (S$1.2 tril­lion) res­cue plan was agreed to by the Euro­pean Union’s 27 mem­ber states on July 21 to help the bloc bounce back from the pan­demic-in­duced re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this week, Euro­pean Com­mis­sion pres­i­dent Ur­sula von der Leyen said in an op-ed car­ried by Ger­man news­pa­per Han­dels­blatt that the deal was “his­toric”, in terms of the size of the re­cov­ery pack­age, the way the money will be raised and how the money will be re­paid.</p>
