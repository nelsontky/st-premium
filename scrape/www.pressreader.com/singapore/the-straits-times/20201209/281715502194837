    <p>With a coro­n­avirus pan­demic that has seen 9.7 mil­lion cases recorded in In­dia and a tank­ing econ­omy to deal with, Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi did not need a pro­tracted protest by a pow­er­ful po­lit­i­cal con­stituency to add to his woes.</p>
    <p>Tens of thou­sands of farm­ers across the coun­try are protest­ing against new leg­is­la­tion that seeks to re­form the sale of agri­cul­tural pro­duce, a show of force that has en­tered its 13th day with farm­ers in­ten­si­fy­ing their move­ment yes­ter­day by call­ing for a na­tion­wide strike.</p>
    <p>Farm­ers sat on roads and rail tracks and held ral­lies, amid sup­port from op­po­si­tion par­ties and trade unions, in a peace­ful protest to mount fur­ther pres­sure on the gov­ern­ment to re­peal three farm laws passed in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>The laws are part of the Modi gov­ern­ment’s re­form agenda aimed at fa­cil­i­tat­ing greater pri­vate in­vest­ment in agri­cul­ture, a sec­tor that ac­counts for around 15 per cent of the coun­try’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct.</p>
    <p>But farm­ers, a ma­jor­ity of whom are small landown­ers strug­gling to eke out a liv­ing, feel that their lot may worsen with the in­tro­duc­tion of the farm laws.</p>
    <p>Highly sus­pi­cious of big cor­po­ra­tions, they feel this is the first step to­wards dis­man­tling a sys­tem where the gov­ern­ment en­sures a min­i­mum price for their food­grains.</p>
    <p>Five rounds of talks be­tween the gov­ern­ment and farm­ers have failed, although a sixth is planned for to­day. Those rep­re­sent­ing the farm­ers were also called in for a meet­ing with Home Min­is­ter Amit Shah late yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Our de­mand is for all three farm laws to be re­pealed and we want new leg­is­la­tion that guar­an­tees a min­i­mum sup­port price for our pro­duce,” said Mr Ab­hi­manyu Ko­har, na­tional co­or­di­na­tor of the Rashtriya Kisan Ma­hasangh, a group rep­re­sent­ing 180 farm­ers’ or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>“The farm­ers won’t leave (the protest sites) with­out their de­mands be­ing met. They have come with ra­tions (of food) for six months.”</p>
    <p>In a coun­try where 60 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion is di­rectly or in­di­rectly tied to agri­cul­ture, the protest­ing farm­ers have gained sym­pa­thy across the board.</p>
    <p>Re­ports of farm lead­ers tak­ing their own tea, food and wa­ter into meet­ings with gov­ern­ment lead­ers have only added to the sup­port for them.</p>
    <p>Over 15 op­po­si­tion par­ties, in­clud­ing Tamil Nadu’s Dravida Mun­netra Kazhagam, have pledged their sup­port as have trade unions from other sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Farm­ers, some with their en­tire fam­i­lies in tow and their trac­tors loaded with sup­plies, have camped for the past two weeks at sev­eral en­try points into Delhi. The farm­ers lead­ing the protests are from the states of Pun­jab, Haryana and Ut­tar Pradesh.</p>
    <p>For Mr Modi, the protests could not have come at a worse time.</p>
    <p>In­dia is the sec­ond-worst af­fected coun­try by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, after the United States.</p>
    <p>Growth has also slowed. It hit a six-year low of 4.7 per cent in the fi­nal quar­ter of last year and con­tracted by 23.4 per cent in the first quar­ter of this year, which in In­dia runs from April to June, due to a strict lock­down im­posed in March.</p>
    <p>The lock­down brought eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity to a com­plete halt. Mr Modi’s gov­ern­ment, oth­er­wise un­wa­ver­ing in its re­form agenda, has of­fered to amend the laws to defuse the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The Prime Min­is­ter, who has been driv­ing re­form in many sec­tors over the years, in­clud­ing rolling out the goods and ser­vices tax in 2017, on Mon­day ap­pealed for sup­port for change, not­ing it is nec­es­sary for devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>“We can­not build the next cen­tury with the laws of the pre­vi­ous cen­tury,” said Mr Modi, who has re­mained pop­u­lar through the pan­demic and eco­nomic trou­bles.</p>
    <p>He has also weath­ered ear­lier protests in­clud­ing those against the Cit­i­zen­ship Amend­ment Act (CAA), which gives re­li­gion-based cit­i­zen­ship. But farm­ers are a lobby group that no politi­cian is keen to an­tag­o­nise.</p>
    <p>“They (the gov­ern­ment) didn’t want to hold talks on CAA. They shut the door. This is a much more in­clu­sive ag­i­ta­tion and it cuts across so­cial iden­ti­ties. This is a very se­ri­ous chal­lenge. The farm is­sue has be­come po­lit­i­cally sen­si­tive,” said jour­nal­ist and writer Ni­lan­jan Mukhopad­hyay.</p>
    <p>“In In­dia, ev­ery­body has some con­nec­tion to a farmer. Ev­ery­one who is stay­ing in ur­ban ar­eas will have fam­ily in the vil­lage. Sym­pa­thies of a large num­ber of ur­ban­ites will be with farm­ers.”</p>
    <p>The farm­ers’ is­sue has also caught in­ter­na­tional at­ten­tion, par­tic­u­larly due to the di­as­pora from the state of Pun­jab, whose farm­ers are lead­ing the protests.</p>
    <p>Cana­dian Prime Min­is­ter Justin Trudeau has spo­ken out in favour of the farm­ers’ protests, elic­it­ing a sharp diplo­matic re­sponse from the In­dian gov­ern­ment wary of any crit­i­cism of do­mes­tic de­vel­op­ments.</p>
    <p>Protests in sup­port of the In­dian farm­ers have also taken place in Bri­tain and Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>“I think this is the first ma­jor chal­lenge which the Modi gov­ern­ment is fac­ing both in terms of pub­lic re­sponse and unity of the op­po­si­tion,” said po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst San­deep Shas­tri.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment has not been able to ex­plain its po­si­tion. I think we call the Prime Min­is­ter a great com­mu­ni­ca­tor. On this par­tic­u­lar is­sue, he has not com­mu­ni­cated clearly to the ben­e­fi­ciary.”</p>
