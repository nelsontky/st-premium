    <p>BEIRUT • Le­banon’s prime min­is­ter-des­ig­nate Mustapha Adib called yes­ter­day for the for­ma­tion of a new govern­ment in record time and urged im­me­di­ate re­forms as a step to­wards se­cur­ing an agree­ment with the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund (IMF).</p>
    <p>He spoke af­ter be­ing des­ig­nated premier and hours be­fore the ar­rival of French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron, whose pres­sure on Le­banon’s frac­tious lead­ers was cru­cial to forg­ing an agree­ment on Mr Adib, an aca­demic and Beirut’s am­bas­sador to Berlin.</p>
    <p>“The op­por­tu­nity for our coun­try is small and the mis­sion I have ac­cepted is based on all the po­lit­i­cal forces ac­knowl­edg­ing that,” Mr Adib said af­ter be­ing des­ig­nated by Pres­i­dent Michel Aoun.</p>
    <p>Donor states want Le­banon to carry out long-de­layed re­forms to stamp out state cor­rup­tion and waste in or­der to re­lease fi­nan­cial sup­port. The pre­vi­ous govern­ment launched talks with the IMF in May, but th­ese stalled amid di­vi­sions on the Le­banese side over the scale of losses in the fi­nan­cial sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Mr Adib said a new govern­ment must be formed in record time and re­forms must be im­ple­mented im­me­di­ately as “an en­try point to an agree­ment with the IMF”.</p>
    <p>He is tasked with guid­ing the coun­try through one of the deep­est eco­nomic crises in its re­cent his­tory and re­build­ing a cap­i­tal city shat­tered by a blast last month.</p>
    <p>He re­places Mr Has­san Diab, also an aca­demic, whose short-lived govern­ment quit in the af­ter­math of the mas­sive blast on Aug 4 that lev­elled the port of Beirut, dam­aged tens of thou­sands of homes and killed more than 180 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Mr Diab was named by the pres­i­dent’s party and its al­lies in the Hizbol­lah-led al­liance, but failed to win the sup­port of fel­low Sunni Mus­lim lead­ers or en­act the eco­nomic re­forms re­quired to un­lock bil­lions of dol­lars in in­ter­na­tional aid and se­cure IMF as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>Mr Adib has se­cured broader po­lit­i­cal back­ing, which should give him greater chances of suc­cess.</p>
    <p>He served as an ad­viser to then Prime Min­is­ter Na­jib Mikati from 2000 and had been Le­banon’s am­bas­sador to Ger­many since 2013. He has a doc­tor­ate in law and po­lit­i­cal science and taught at the Le­banese Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>As word of his nom­i­na­tion leaked out on Sun­day, it was met with dis­may by many Le­banese at the fore­front of protests that erupted last Oc­to­ber seek­ing to over­throw an en­tire rul­ing class blamed for decades of cor­rup­tion and mis­man­age­ment that bled state cof­fers dry.</p>
    <p>“This is yet an­other ma­noeu­vre by the failed regime to re­float it­self,” Mr Samy Ge­mayel, a par­lia­men­tar­ian who re­signed last month, said on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>“The mech­a­nism is clear. One de­cides, a part ex­e­cutes and the other part cov­ers up. This is mak­ing a fool of peo­ple and pre­vents change,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Diab took of­fice in Jan­uary, promptly de­faulted on US$30 bil­lion (S$41 bil­lion) in in­ter­na­tional debt and turned to the IMF for help in se­cur­ing some US$10 bil­lion to sup­port wide-rang­ing re­forms.</p>
    <p>Shack­led by years of pa­tron­age and sec­tar­i­an­ism, and fac­ing sig­nif­i­cant do­mes­tic op­po­si­tion, Mr Diab’s team failed to clinch the IMF deal and was un­able to en­act re­forms in the elec­tric­ity sec­tor, for in­stance, or ad­dress cor­rup­tion con­cerns as re­quired by the in­ter­na­tional community.</p>
    <p>The blast at the port ex­ac­er­bated the cri­sis and is es­ti­mated by the World Bank to have caused up to US$4.6 bil­lion in phys­i­cal dam­age.</p>
    <p>Mr Adib will now face the tough task of re­sum­ing talks with the IMF, en­act­ing re­forms that have eluded suc­ces­sive Cabi­nets and se­cur­ing in­ter­na­tional aid to re­build the port and neigh­bour­hoods dev­as­tated by the blast.</p>
    <p>Mr Mustapha Adib is tasked with guid­ing the coun­try through one of the deep­est eco­nomic crises in its re­cent his­tory and re­build­ing a cap­i­tal city shat­tered by a blast last month.</p>
