    <p>MI­LAN • An­to­nio Conte will con­tinue at the helm of In­ter Mi­lan next sea­son, the Se­rie A club con­firmed on Tues­day, only days af­ter the fiery Ital­ian hinted he was ready to quit af­ter just one cam­paign.</p>
    <p>The for­mer Italy and Chelsea man­ager held a “con­struc­tive meet­ing fo­cused on con­ti­nu­ity and strat­egy” with the club’s Chi­nese pres­i­dent Steven Zhang and team man­age­ment which lasted just over three hours in a villa out­side Mi­lan.</p>
    <p>“The two par­ties laid the foun­da­tions to con­tinue work­ing to­gether on the club’s project,” the club said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>In­ter have opted for con­ti­nu­ity af­ter fin­ish­ing sec­ond in the Ital­ian league, just one point be­hind cham­pi­ons Ju­ven­tus, with their Chi­nese own­ers also con­firm­ing con­fi­dence in the en­tire man­age­ment team.</p>
    <p>Conte will now lead the club’s bid to top­ple Ju­ven­tus with coach­ing novice An­drea Pirlo hav­ing re­placed Mau­r­izio Sarri at the helm of the nine-time de­fend­ing Se­rie A cham­pi­ons.</p>
    <p>The 51-year-old Conte’s de­par­ture had been her­alded fol­low­ing an out­burst af­ter In­ter Mi­lan’s 3-2 Europa League fi­nal de­feat by Sevilla last Fri­day, ex­tend­ing a nine-year tro­phy drought.</p>
    <p>“Now we’ll re­turn to Mi­lan, we’ll take a cou­ple of days off. We will try to plan the fu­ture of In­ter with or without me,” he said then.</p>
    <p>“It has been a very tough sea­son from all points of view, the best de­ci­sion must be taken for the good of In­ter, with the ut­most cor­dial­ity. I didn’t like some sit­u­a­tions.”</p>
    <p>The for­mer Ju­ven­tus boss took over in May last year on a three-year con­tract worth a re­ported €12 mil­lion (S$19.4 mil­lion) a sea­son. But his re­la­tion­ship with club man­age­ment and chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Giuseppe Marotta, in par­tic­u­lar, is known to be tense.</p>
    <p>On the fi­nal day of the do­mes­tic sea­son, Conte slammed the fact his play­ers had been of­fered “lit­tle pro­tec­tion from the club” and he did not “want an­other year like that”.</p>
    <p>It was not the first time he had pub­licly com­plained about the club, hav­ing been fiercely crit­i­cal af­ter their Cham­pi­ons League exit in the group stage, which he blamed on a lack of in­vest­ment de­spite the sign­ing of Romelu Lukaku for €65 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he has still man­aged to build a com­pet­i­tive team around the Bel­gium striker and Ar­gentina for­ward Lau­taro Martinez, which Zhang said made him “op­ti­mistic for the fu­ture”.</p>
    <p>For­mer Ju­ven­tus coach Mas­si­m­il­iano Al­le­gri had been ready to suc­ceed Conte, whom he also re­placed in Turin in 2014, ac­cord­ing to re­ports. Al­le­gri parted com­pany with Ju­ven­tus last year and has not been in man­age­ment since.</p>
