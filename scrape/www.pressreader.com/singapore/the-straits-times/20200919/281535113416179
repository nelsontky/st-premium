    <p>Ac­count­ing firm Ernst & Young has made a po­lice re­port re­gard­ing al­legedly unau­tho­rised sig­na­tures on some fi­nan­cial state­ments of Novena Global Health­care Group, which is owned by cousins Ter­ence and Nel­son Loh. Po­lice con­firmed that a re­port had been lodged, and that it is look­ing into the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Ac­count­ing firm Ernst & Young (EY) has made a po­lice re­port re­gard­ing al­legedly unau­tho­rised sig­na­tures of the firm on some fi­nan­cial state­ments of Novena Global Health­care Group, which is owned by Sin­ga­porean cousins Ter­ence and Nel­son Loh.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that the po­lice re­port was made on Wed­nes­day. Po­lice con­firmed that a re­port had been filed, and that they are look­ing into the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>EY said that it did not sign off on the fi­nan­cial state­ments.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing through his lawyer, Mr Ter­ence Loh said yes­ter­day that he was aware of the po­lice re­port, de­nied any wrong­do­ing and added that he was tak­ing ad­vice on the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>His cousin Nel­son Loh could not be reached.</p>
    <p>Novena Global Health­care Group was in­cor­po­rated in the Cay­man Is­lands by the Loh cousins.</p>
    <p>In Novem­ber 2016, a sub­sidiary – Novena Global Health­care – was in­cor­po­rated in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The firms are among at least two dozen en­ti­ties linked to Mr Ter­ence Loh, 42, and Mr Nel­son Loh, 40.</p>
    <p>Last month, the Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Au­thor­ity said it would be tak­ing en­force­ment ac­tion against two com­pa­nies owned by the Lohs – Novena Global Health­care and Novena Life Sciences – for fail­ing to file the an­nual re­turns due on July 29, 2018, and Dec 9 last year, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>The two men and their Chi­nese busi­ness part­ner Evan­ge­line Shen, 32, made news last month for their £280 mil­lion (S$492 mil­lion) takeover bid for English Pre­mier League club New­cas­tle United.</p>
    <p>This bid was made un­der the Bel­la­graph Nova Group (BN Group), which the three founded in July.</p>
    <p>Public­ity ma­te­rial de­scribed the BN Group as “a world’s lead­ing con­glom­er­ate” with 31 en­ti­ties in “all ma­jor busi­ness fields, from fi­nan­cial to sport, health­care and lux­ury goods, en­ter­tain­ment and ro­bot­ics”.</p>
    <p>The group also claimed it had US$12 bil­lion (S$16.3 bil­lion) in rev­enue last year and 23,000 em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>Reuters re­ported last month that some public­ity photos of the co­founders with for­mer United States pres­i­dent Barack Obama had been</p>
    <p>pho­to­shopped. Soon af­ter, other in­con­sis­ten­cies in the group’s and founders’ press re­leases and so­cial me­dia ac­counts sur­faced.</p>
    <p>Ax­ing­ton, a Catal­ist-listed com­pany owned by the Lohs, also came un­der the spotlight. Ms Shen re­signed from her po­si­tion as non-in­de­pen­dent, non-ex­ec­u­tive chair­man at Ax­ing­ton, other di­rec­tors also stepped down, and trad­ing of the counter has been sus­pended since Aug 31.</p>
    <p>The Lohs, who used to be in bank­ing, had in the past spo­ken about grow­ing their health­care busi­ness to be one of Asia’s largest in­te­grated med­i­cal health­care and aes­thetic groups. Their Novu Med­i­cal Aes­thetic Clinic has six out­lets in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
