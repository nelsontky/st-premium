    <p>Nurs­ing home staff in Sin­ga­pore are now be­ing tested for Covid-19 once ev­ery two months as part of mea­sures to en­sure that se­nior cit­i­zens in the homes are kept safe. A Min­istry of Health spokesman said all nurs­ing home providers will com­plete one round of testing of all staff ev­ery two months as part of a reg­u­lar testing pro­gramme that be­gan late last month.</p>
    <p>Nurs­ing home staff in Sin­ga­pore are now be­ing tested for Covid-19 once ev­ery two months as part of mea­sures to en­sure that se­nior cit­i­zens in the homes are kept safe from the virus.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times, a Min­istry of Health (MOH) spokesman said that all nurs­ing home providers will com­plete one round of testing of all staff ev­ery two months as part of a reg­u­lar sur­veil­lance testing pro­gramme that be­gan late last month.</p>
    <p>There are about 9,000 nurs­ing home em­ploy­ees and 16,000 res­i­dents in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Sur­veil­lance testing of nurs­ing home res­i­dents will also be con­ducted in the com­ing months, added the spokesman.</p>
    <p>The min­istry will also study how to in­tro­duce testing for other groups that in­ter­act with nurs­ing homes, such as vol­un­teers and ex­ter­nal ven­dors, as other meth­ods of testing – like anti­gen rapid testing – emerge.</p>
    <p>“This will help main­tain the level of pro­tec­tion for se­niors in nurs­ing homes, in the light of the higher risks that can come with the over­all safe re­open­ing,” said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>All nurs­ing home staff and res­i­dents un­der­went one round of mass testing in May as a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure. At the time, the mass testing ex­er­cise also in­cluded staff in wel­fare and shel­ter homes, which come un­der the purview of the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment (MSF). About 30,000 em­ploy­ees and res­i­dents in Sin­ga­pore’s res­i­den­tial care homes for the el­derly were tested then.</p>
    <p>An MSF spokesman told ST that since mid-July, a rou­tine 25 per cent strat­i­fied sam­pled swab­bing has been done ev­ery two weeks for staff and res­i­dents at 36 MSF-funded or li­censed homes serv­ing the el­derly. This means that any given in­di­vid­ual is swabbed once about ev­ery two months.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors are not cur­rently be­ing tested, she added.</p>
    <p>Vis­it­ing guide­lines at such homes have not changed since vis­its were al­lowed again from June 19.</p>
    <p>Each res­i­dent is al­lowed two pre­des­ig­nated vis­i­tors, but only one can visit at any given time. Each home is al­lowed to have a max­i­mum of only 10 vis­i­tors at a time.</p>
    <p>MSF has grad­u­ally al­lowed more ac­tiv­i­ties for res­i­dents, such as small su­per­vised group out­ings, and home leave has been re­sumed.</p>
    <p>For nurs­ing homes, four des­ig­nated vis­i­tors are al­lowed per res­i­dent, up from two when vis­its were first al­lowed. Only one des­ig­nated vis­i­tor is al­lowed at any one time. Vis­its can now be up to an hour, up from 30 min­utes pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>These changes took ef­fect from July 31, said an MOH spokesman.</p>
    <p>The changes were made as the min­istry recog­nised that in­ter­ac­tion with fam­ily mem­bers and loved ones is im­por­tant for se­nior cit­i­zens’ so­cio-emo­tional well-be­ing, she added.</p>
    <p>Other pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures con­tinue to be in place, such as set­ting aside ded­i­cated visi­ta­tion ar­eas, pre-sched­ul­ing vis­its, cap­ping the to­tal num­ber of vis­i­tors on premises each day, en­sur­ing safe dis­tanc­ing, vis­i­tor screen­ing and good in­fec­tion con­trol prac­tices.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tinue to mon­i­tor the evolv­ing Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion and work closely with the nurs­ing homes to re­view the var­i­ous cur­rent pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures, tak­ing into ac­count fac­tors such as the risk of com­mu­nity spread and the ex­po­sure of staff and res­i­dents as more so­cial and eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties re­sume in the broader com­mu­nity,” said the MOH spokesman.</p>
    <p>Sur­veil­lance testing of nurs­ing home res­i­dents will also be con­ducted in the com­ing months, added the spokesman. The min­istry will also study how to in­tro­duce testing for other groups that in­ter­act with nurs­ing homes, such as vol­un­teers and ex­ter­nal ven­dors, as other meth­ods of testing – like anti­gen rapid testing – emerge.</p>
