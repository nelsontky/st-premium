    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Try some­thing healthy and fun to­day – a new kind of work­out, a nu­tri­tious treat or maybe a dance class. You need to take care of your­self, of course, but it does not have to be a drag.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>You need to deal with some­one who may be too at­tached to you or to an idea or an or­gan­i­sa­tion. Your en­ergy is ter­rific, so you should be able to find a good way to say the right thing.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Try to fig­ure out ex­actly what needs to hap­pen be­fore you get started – it is sure to pay off. This may not be your usual way of do­ing things, but the day’s en­ergy re­wards plan­ning in a ma­jor way.</p>
    <p>Cancer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>It is a great time to make plans of all kinds – va­ca­tion, work, fam­ily or hobby-re­lated. Your grasp of the de­tails and your eye for bar­gains are both en­hanced, so all should flow smoothly.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>You have to spend some time re­view­ing your fi­nances. It may work out bet­ter than you hope, but ig­no­rance is not bliss in this case. Your men­tal en­ergy is per­fect for balanc­ing ac­counts.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Try to help oth­ers makes sense of to­day’s big mys­tery. It might not seem com­plex to you, but to them, it is baf­fling. Use your good en­ergy to ed­u­cate.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>You just can­not seem to shake this loom­ing sense that you need to be do­ing more or do­ing some­thing dif­fer­ent. Lis­ten to that in­ner voice and then make the nec­es­sary changes.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>It is the lit­tle stuff that makes life spe­cial, es­pe­cially on a day like to­day. Em­brace the minu­tiae of your life and you may spot the hid­den bonus that is com­ing your way later on.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>You are sure to butt heads with an au­thor­ity fig­ure, so make sure that you are push­ing him only as much as he can take or he will turn on you with a vengeance. Your judg­ment is key.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>You can get quite a lot done, even if you are not feel­ing all that mo­ti­vated.</p>
    <p>Your great en­ergy car­ries you for­ward through­out and helps you make a big splash in the end.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>You are con­sid­er­ably more grounded emo­tion­ally, which is both good and bad. You may not have as many great ideas, but you are also bet­ter off deal­ing with that one nutty friend.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>What­ever you are wor­ried about to­day, you need to just go for it quickly. Other­wise, you are sure to mire your­self in doubts and wor­ries. There is no time for that. Act first, ques­tion later.</p>
