    <p>The per­sonal in­for­ma­tion from 2.8 mil­lion Eatigo ac­counts has been stolen and put up for sale on an on­line fo­rum, in­clud­ing from 400,000 ac­counts be­long­ing to users in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In an e-mail to af­fected cus­tomers yes­ter­day seen by The Sun­day Times, the on­line restau­rant reser­va­tion plat­form said that the in­for­ma­tion stolen was from more than 18 months ago and in­cluded names, e-mail ad­dresses and phone num­bers.</p>
    <p>“We were made aware on Oct 30 that along with sev­eral other e-com­merce plat­forms, we were the sub­ject of a data se­cu­rity in­ci­dent,” the com­pany said.</p>
    <p>“Your ex­ist­ing Eatigo ac­count pass­word is pro­tected by en­cryp­tion and hence safe. We do not store credit card in­for­ma­tion on our sys­tem.”</p>
    <p>Eatigo in­formed the Per­sonal Data Pro­tec­tion Com­mis­sion (PDPC) of the breach on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>An Eatigo spokesman told ST that the in­for­ma­tion was from an old data­base that was last up­dated in 2018 and is no longer in use.</p>
    <p>“We are run­ning checks and ex­pect that not all 400,000 ac­counts re­late to cur­rent users,” she added.</p>
    <p>News of Eatigo’s data breach comes just a day af­ter e-com­merce gi­ant Lazada con­firmed that per­sonal in­for­ma­tion from 1.1 mil­lion RedMart user ac­counts had been stolen.</p>
    <p>Both sets of in­for­ma­tion were put up for sale on the same web­site.</p>
    <p>The stolen Lazada in­for­ma­tion was also more than 18 months old but it is not known if the two in­ci­dents are re­lated.</p>
    <p>In its e-mail, Eatigo said it will col­lab­o­rate with the rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties on this mat­ter and has set up a sup­port team that af­fected cus­tomers can reach out to with queries or con­cerns.</p>
    <p>It also ad­vised cus­tomers to log into their ac­counts and re­set their pass­words as a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure, and to be alert to any spam e-mails re­quest­ing per­sonal or sen­si­tive in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The PDPC said it is aware of the is­sue and is in­ves­ti­gat­ing.</p>
