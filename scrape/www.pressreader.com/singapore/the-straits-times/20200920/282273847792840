    <p>When Ms No­raini Mis­rom sought as­sis­tance at Work­force Sin­ga­pore’s (WSG) Ca­reers Con­nect cen­tre at Wood­lands Civic Cen­tre in Oc­to­ber last year, she was at the end of her tether.</p>
    <p>She had been re­trenched two months be­fore. All her job search ef­forts had proved fruit­less.</p>
    <p>But now, the 51-year-old is her old bub­bly self again af­ter a ca­reer coach helped her sharpen her re­sume, hone her search skills and even­tu­ally land a new job in June.</p>
    <p>Ms No­raini, a mother of two, says: “I have to thank the team from WSG. With­out them, I might still be search­ing for a job.”</p>
    <p>In Au­gust last year, the Sin­ga­porean was into her 22nd year of work­ing as an ad­min­is­tra­tive of­fi­cer at de­liv­ery com­pany UPS when she was laid off.</p>
    <p>Although she re­ceived about 20 months of ben­e­fits, the re­trench­ment was a bolt from the blue.</p>
    <p>She says: “The news was sud­den and left me shocked and sad. My son, 22, is study­ing in a poly­tech­nic, and my daugh­ter, 20, is do­ing a Higher Na­tional ITE Cer­tifi­cate (Higher Nitec).</p>
    <p>“My hus­band is a me­chanic and I also have to give my par­ents an al­lowance. So I needed an in­come.”</p>
    <p>She started look­ing for work, an­swer­ing job ads and at­tend­ing a course to get ca­reer and train­ing ad­vice.</p>
    <p>But two months later, she was still with­out a job.</p>
    <p>That was when she went to the Ca­reers Con­nect cen­tre and met se­nior ca­reer coach Judy Yap, 62.</p>
    <p>Ms Yap re­calls: “When I first met No­raini, her worry showed all over her face. She did not say a lot, but opened up af­ter I asked some ques­tions about her fam­ily back­ground.</p>
    <p>“As a ca­reer coach, I need to un­der­stand her – her ex­pe­ri­ence, strengths and goals – so I can bet­ter match her with suit­able va­can­cies that my team comes across.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter look­ing at Ms No­raini’s re­sume, Ms Yap felt it was too generic and not up­dated.</p>
    <p>She says: “When re­cruiters look at your re­sume, they es­sen­tially want to know what you have to of­fer their com­pany and how you have con­trib­uted to past em­ploy­ers.”</p>
    <p>Ms No­raini’s orig­i­nal re­sume listed all the cour­ses she at­tended over the years, but did not hone in on her core com­pe­ten­cies.</p>
    <p>Af­ter un­der­stand­ing that Ms No­raini wanted to con­tinue work­ing in ad­min­is­tra­tion, Ms Yap tried to em­pha­sise her rel­e­vant skills, such as her abil­ity to multi-task, work in­de­pen­dently, do data en­try and use Mi­crosoft Of­fice pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>“At UPS, No­raini was also quite good at trac­ing lost parcels, so I added that she was good at ‘in­ves­tiga­tive so­lu­tions’, a qual­ity that could help her stand out from other ap­pli­cants.”</p>
    <p>Ms Yap showed Ms No­raini sam­ple re­sumes to use as a ref­er­ence, and also directed her to­wards ca­reer fairs and jobs por­tals such as MyCa­reer­sFu­ture. When­ever a suit­able po­si­tion came up, Ms Yap in­formed her.</p>
    <p>That was how Ms No­raini landed her cur­rent po­si­tion as a data con­troller at TG25, a com­pany which pro­vides lodg­ing for for­eign work­ers.</p>
    <p>Although her cur­rent salary is about half what she used to draw, Ms No­raini says: “I am very happy with my new job. My work­place is now around Choa Chu Kang, quite near my five-room HDB flat in Wood­lands.”</p>
    <p>Her re­spon­si­bil­i­ties now in­clude check­ing work­ers in and out, as well as other ad­min­is­tra­tive mat­ters.</p>
    <p>“The work is dif­fer­ent, but def­i­nitely within my ca­pa­bil­i­ties. I have also made many friends and am very thank­ful to WSG for help­ing me land this job af­ter search­ing for so long.”</p>
    <p>Ms Yap’s ad­vice to oth­ers in this predica­ment: “Re­trench­ment can cause anx­i­ety, un­cer­tainty and frus­tra­tions, es­pe­cially when one has been in the job for decades.</p>
    <p>“But it is es­sen­tial that we do not suc­cumb to feel­ings of hope­less­ness and al­ways try to seize the next op­por­tu­nity.”</p>
