    <p>A mar­ried for­mer foot­ball player met a woman on on­line dat­ing plat­form Tin­der and the pair went club­bing with one of her friends in 2018.</p>
    <p>Mo­ham­mad Im­ran Sahib Mo­hamed Ibrahim Sahib, 38, later took the two women home in his car.</p>
    <p>After his date alighted at her des­ti­na­tion, Im­ran, who had played for the Tampines Rovers and Home United foot­ball teams, among oth­ers, told the vic­tim, then aged 21, to sit in the front pas­sen­ger seat.</p>
    <p>The fa­ther of three then mo­lested her as they were trav­el­ling along Ang Mo Kio Av­enue 6. But she man­aged to es­cape, flee­ing bare-footed when he stopped the car to re­lieve him­self by the side of a road, a district court heard dur­ing the trial.</p>
    <p>Im­ran de­nied mo­lest­ing the woman but District Judge Kan Shuk Weng yes­ter­day found him guilty of two counts of mo­lesta­tion. She also con­victed him of one count of us­ing crim­i­nal force on the woman.</p>
    <p>Im­ran was of­fered bail at $5,000 and will be sen­tenced on Nov 13.</p>
    <p>The two women can­not be named ow­ing to a gag or­der by the court.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tor Chee Ee Ling said the crime took place on March 4, 2018, after the trio left a club called Bal­iza in Raf­fles Boule­vard around 6am. As they neared Im­ran’s car, his date threw up and as her friend ex­pressed con­cern for her, Im­ran grabbed the vic­tim and kissed her on the lips. De­spite be­ing mo­lested, she got into the car as she did not want to leave her un­well friend alone with Im­ran.</p>
    <p>DPP Chee fur­ther told the court that after get­ting out of Im­ran’s car along Ang Mo Kio Av­enue 6, the “ter­ri­fied” vic­tim “walked bare­footed to (her friend’s block of flats), for about 11/ km”. “In the vic</p>
    <p>2 tim’s haste, she left her high-heeled shoes in the ac­cused’s car”.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim reached the void deck at 7.17am and waited till around 8am be­fore tak­ing a taxi home. She told her sis­ter what had hap­pened but did not make a po­lice re­port un­til March 20, 2018, as she was ini­tially wor­ried Im­ran would hurt her.</p>
    <p>The DPP said that since the in­ci­dent, the vic­tim has “had night­mares of peo­ple rap­ing her and</p>
    <p>there was once she dreamt that she com­mit­ted sui­cide”.</p>
    <p>“It is clear the vic­tim is still trau­ma­tised by her or­deal, as she ap­peared vis­i­bly up­set and broke down four times while tes­ti­fy­ing in court,” she added.</p>
    <p>Im­ran, rep­re­sented by lawyer Revi Shanker, claimed the vic­tim had con­sumed am­phet­a­mine and was act­ing “strangely”, shout­ing at strangers as the night wore on.</p>
