    <p>Euro­pean Union lead­ers are set to hold an emer­gency vir­tual sum­mit to­mor­row to dis­cuss how to tackle a new and dan­ger­ous spike in Covid-19 in­fec­tions. A re­turn to dra­co­nian na­tional shut­downs may be im­mi­nent.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean Union lead­ers have agreed to hold an emer­gency vir­tual sum­mit to­mor­row to dis­cuss ways to tackle a new and dan­ger­ous spike in coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>But since more hes­i­tant ef­forts to con­tain the pan­demic have not pro­duced the hoped-for re­sults, a re­turn to the ear­lier dra­co­nian na­tional shut­downs which ev­ery Euro­pean leader sought to avoid now looks to be a dis­tinct pos­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Last week, Spain earned the du­bi­ous hon­our of be­com­ing the first Euro­pean coun­try to reg­is­ter one mil­lion in­fec­tions, a record swiftly fol­lowed by France. And Bri­tain, with ap­prox­i­mately 900,000 cu­mu­la­tive cases, is not far be­hind.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tion rates are soar­ing to lev­els not seen since the pan­demic first struck the con­ti­nent ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Lat­est statis­tics com­piled by the Euro­pean Cen­tre for Dis­ease Pre­ven­tion and Con­trol show that apart from steadily ris­ing in­fec­tion rates in Bel­gium, France, Ger­many and Bri­tain, the virus is now af­fect­ing the rel­a­tively poorer cen­tral and east­ern Euro­pean coun­tries, with the Czech Re­pub­lic, Slo­vakia and Poland hit par­tic­u­larly hard.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent An­drzej Duda of Poland last Satur­day tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus, as did his de­fence min­is­ter a day later.</p>
    <p>But what wor­ries Euro­pean lead­ers most is the re­newed pres­sure on their coun­tries’ med­i­cal ser­vices. The cur­rent wave of in­fec­tions is led by younger peo­ple, so un­til now it had lit­tle im­pact on hos­pi­tal ad­mis­sions or mor­tal­ity rates.</p>
    <p>But this is chang­ing fast. While on av­er­age only about a fifth of all the acute care hos­pi­tal beds across Europe are now oc­cu­pied by Covid-19 pa­tients in crit­i­cal con­di­tion, in big Euro­pean cap­i­tals, such as Paris, that fig­ure is al­ready edg­ing up to­wards 40 per cent of all acute care beds. And this is ahead of win­ter and the flu sea­son, which hit the el­derly and vul­ner­a­ble hard, and al­ways drive hos­pi­tal ad­mis­sions up.</p>
    <p>As th­ese wor­ry­ing trends be­came clearer, most Euro­pean l ead­ers have tried to pre­vent a re­turn to the</p>
    <p>While on av­er­age only about a fifth of all the acute care hos­pi­tal beds across Europe are now oc­cu­pied by Covid-19 pa­tients in crit­i­cal con­di­tion, in big Euro­pean cap­i­tals, such as Paris, that fig­ure is al­ready edg­ing up to­wards 40 per cent of all acute care beds.</p>
    <p>to­tal shut­downs of ear­lier this year, largely be­cause an in­for­mal con­sen­sus has emerged among them that the con­ti­nent can no longer risk the se­vere eco­nomic im­pact of such an ex­treme mea­sure.</p>
    <p>Yet one coun­try af­ter another is now ap­ply­ing lock­down mea­sures in any­thing but name. The Czech au­thor­i­ties have shut down schools, restau­rants and most shops and ser­vices, notwith­stand­ing the fact that Czech Prime Min­is­ter Andrej Babis claimed just this Mon­day that he “can’t imag­ine” a “full eco­nomic shut­down”.</p>
    <p>Poland may go down the same route by the end of this week, un­less in­fec­tion rates slow down – some­thing which seems un­likely.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron – whose gov­ern­ment tried ev­ery­thing pos­si­ble to avoid a na­tional shut­down through a re­cent surge in coro­n­avirus cases – ac­knowl­edged that the coun­try could be head­ing back to­wards broader re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>And Span­ish Prime Min­is­ter Pe­dro Sanchez, who warned that his coun­try is “im­mersed in the sec­ond wave of the pan­demic”, has im­posed a state of emer­gency com­bined with a to­tal cur­few from 11pm each day.</p>
    <p>The Span­ish gov­ern­ment has been more re­al­is­tic than many of its Euro­pean coun­ter­parts by ad­mit­ting that the cur­rent mea­sures could last for the next six months.</p>
    <p>But the po­lit­i­cal stakes are ex­cep­tion­ally high for Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel. Her stew­ard­ship dur­ing the pan­demic ear­lier this year was hailed world­wide as a model of good gov­er­nance.</p>
    <p>How­ever, mat­ters may be dif­fer­ent now, as the coun­try faces a new wave of in­fec­tions. The Chan­cel­lor is said to have told top lead­ers of her rul­ing Chris­tian Demo­cratic Union party that Ger­many’s “sit­u­a­tion is threat­en­ing” and that the na­tion faces “very, very dif­fi­cult months ahead”. Her com­ments were leaked to the me­dia.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Com­mis­sion, the EU’s ex­ec­u­tive body, has been largely side­lined, as EU mem­ber states went their own sep­a­rate ways in fight­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>None­the­less, Dr Ur­sula von der Leyen, the com­mis­sion’s pres­i­dent, has re­ac­ti­vated a cri­sis unit that she had set up ear­lier this year to deal with the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In the­ory, the com­mis­sion has at its dis­posal a fund of up to €750 bil­lion (S$1.2 tril­lion) to of­fer a mix­ture of grants and loans to coun­tries af­fected by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But all of this is far from suf­fi­cient in the face of the new re­ces­sion that Europe may be fac­ing.</p>
    <p>While the EU econ­omy did not per­form as badly as ini­tially feared dur­ing the sec­ond and third quar­ters of this year, the com­mis­sion’s au­tumn fore­cast sched­uled to be re­leased next week is likely to be very gloomy. So, the EU ex­ec­u­tive is pre­par­ing for fresh dis­cus­sions about al­lo­cat­ing even big­ger funds.</p>
    <p>“It is very likely that we will have to re­de­fine an or­ches­trated re­sponse,” France’s Pres­i­dent Macron re­cently ad­mit­ted.</p>
