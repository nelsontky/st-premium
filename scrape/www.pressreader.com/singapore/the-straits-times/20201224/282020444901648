    <p>Speak­ing to a hospi­tal phar­ma­cist on Tues­day, re­tired con­tainer driver Ow Soo Tian re­cited the five types of medicine he takes, when he takes them, and any side ef­fects.</p>
    <p>Such con­sul­ta­tions, part of Alexan­dra Hospi­tal’s (AH) rou­tine re­views with pa­tients to en­sure that they know their med­i­ca­tion, are usu­ally done in per­son.</p>
    <p>But this time, 71-year-old Mr Ow, who needs a walk­ing stick to get around, spoke to phar­ma­cist Joshua Low via tele­con­fer­enc­ing from the com­fort of his home.</p>
    <p>The vir­tual con­nec­tion was made pos­si­ble by the hospi­tal’s new ro­bot Temi, sav­ing him a trip to AH.</p>
    <p>The hospi­tal is tri­alling the use of smart ro­bots like Temi to visit pa­tients in Queen­stown who, like Mr Ow, are house­bound, iso­lated, have mul­ti­ple con­di­tions and have lim­ited ac­cess to tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>For Mr Ow, who suf­fered a stroke and has been liv­ing in a rental flat in Mei Ling since his dis­charge from AH slightly less than a year ago, Temi will re­duce the num­ber of hospi­tal trips.</p>
    <p>Temi and her Ghim Moh coun­ter­part Ohmni, spon­sored by pri­vate and cor­po­rate donors, are part of AH’s trial that be­gan on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Dr Ja­son Phua, chief ex­ec­u­tive of AH, said: “Right now, it’s just not pos­si­ble for health­care work­ers to go to so many dif­fer­ent homes. For health­care work­ers to see all these pa­tients, we would need the pa­tients to come down to the hospi</p>
    <p>tal. But why have them make the in­con­ve­nient trip of com­ing down to the hospi­tal?”</p>
    <p>The ro­bots would be “a game changer” if the scheme is scaled prop­erly, mak­ing house vis­its more ef­fi­cient, he added.</p>
    <p>AH said that the ro­bots could be used for con­sul­ta­tions such as in phar­macy and nutri­tion, which need not be done in per­son.</p>
    <p>Temi is equipped with a com­puter screen and cam­era, and has Wi-Fi con­nec­tiv­ity via a don­gle brought by hu­man vol­un­teers who ac­com­pany her on house vis­its. She can also play recorded videos such as phys­io­ther­apy ex­er­cises cus­tomised to each pa­tient, AH said.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, Temi is based in the newly opened Geri­atric Ser­vices Hub at Li­ons Be­frien­ders Mei Ling Se­nior Ac­tiv­ity Cen­tre, which pro­vides med­i­cal ser­vices to se­niors in the neigh­bour­hood who are above the age of 65, have no reg­u­lar doc­tor and are prone to fall­ing.</p>
    <p>Dr Phua said: “We hope to have prompt iden­ti­fi­ca­tion of frail el­derly in the com­mu­nity, of­fer timely ed­u­ca­tion and treat­ment, and make geri­atric ser­vice ac­ces­si­ble and af­ford­able to Queen­stown res­i­dents, as well as re­duce emer­gency depart­ment vis­its.”</p>
    <p>Temi is also able to in­ter­act with pa­tients, re­spond­ing to user com­mands such as play­ing songs. AH hopes this will in­ter­est the se­niors and raise their spir­its.</p>
    <p>The ro­bot played a Christ­mas song to an amused Mr Ow, who de­clared her “quite fun”.</p>
