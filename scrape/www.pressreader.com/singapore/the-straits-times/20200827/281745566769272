    <p>SEOUL • South Korea saw a 10 per cent year-on-year jump in the num­ber of foreigners stay­ing in the coun­try in May, with trav­ellers and mi­grants stranded by the strict bor­der con­trol mea­sures that have been put in place glob­ally to tackle the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, ac­cord­ing to data re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Korea Im­mi­gra­tion Ser­vice said the num­ber of foreigners who were il­le­gally stay­ing in the coun­try hit an all-time high of 396,654 in May, re­ported Yon­hap news agency.</p>
    <p>Of this num­ber, about 75 per cent, or 296,000, were vis­i­tors who had en­tered the coun­try without a visa for a 90-day stay,</p>
    <p>This trans­lated into an 11 per cent in­crease in the num­ber of short-term vis­i­tors stay­ing il­le­gally in the coun­try, com­pared with the same month last year.</p>
    <p>“As in­ter­na­tional travel was blocked due to Covid-19, short­term res­i­dents could not leave the coun­try af­ter their visa-free stay pe­riod ex­pired,” an of­fi­cial from the Im­mi­gra­tion Ser­vice said.</p>
    <p>There was also a 7.4 per cent in­crease in the num­ber of longterm im­mi­grants over­stay­ing their visas – at about 100,000.</p>
    <p>“Foreigners who en­tered the coun­try with a long-term visa have to leave the coun­try af­ter three years of em­ploy­ment to ex­tend their visa. But they have also be­come il­le­gal res­i­dents due to coro­n­avirus travel re­stric­tions,” said the of­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>The pro­por­tion of il­le­gal foreigners in the coun­try also hit a record high of 18.5 per cent. This was up from 15.5 per cent in De­cem­ber last year, the agency said.</p>
    <p>The Im­mi­gra­tion Ser­vice said the gov­ern­ment was mak­ing ef­forts to repa­tri­ate il­le­gal im­mi­grants to their home coun­tries, but an in­creas­ing num­ber of na­tions were un­will­ing to ac­cept even their own cit­i­zens, Yon­hap re­ported.</p>
    <p>Year-on-year rise in num­ber of foreigners stay­ing in South Korea in May, due to bor­der con­trol mea­sures that have left foreigners stuck in the coun­try.</p>
