    <p>COPEN­HAGEN • A coun­try gen­er­ally ad­mired for its high stan­dards of gen­der equal­ity is now deal­ing with al­le­ga­tions of sys­tem­atic sex­ual ha­rass­ment at the top of the po­lit­i­cal es­tab­lish­ment.</p>
    <p>Den­mark’s Par­lia­ment has for years al­legedly served as a back­drop for misog­y­nis­tic con­duct in­clud­ing ev­ery­thing from rape to sex­ual in­tim­i­da­tion of fe­male in­terns by male law­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>That is ac­cord­ing to a list of ac­cu­sa­tions signed by 322 cur­rent and for­mer fe­male politi­cians and Par­lia­ment em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Mette Fred­erik­sen says it is now “im­pos­si­ble to con­test” that there is a prob­lem, and has hired ex­ter­nal lawyers to look into the al­le­ga­tions. That is as she her­self faces crit­i­cism for ap­point­ing a for­eign min­is­ter who ad­mit­ted to hav­ing had sex with a 15-year-old when he was 34.</p>
    <p>The dis­cus­sion has forced a na­tional de­bate around abuse in a coun­try that sees it­self as a bas­tion of equal­ity and open­ness.</p>
    <p>Part of the is­sue is com­pla­cency, ac­cord­ing to Ms Helle Thorn­ingSch­midt, a for­mer prime min­is­ter and the first woman to lead Den­mark’s gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>“We’ve long as­sumed that we’d achieved gen­der equal­ity,” she said in a phone in­ter­view. “And be­cause of that, we as­sumed that there’s prob­a­bly no sex­ual ha­rass­ment.”</p>
    <p>But the rev­e­la­tions in re­cent weeks are a “wake-up call”, she added.</p>
    <p>Den­mark’s #MeToo moment started in Au­gust, roughly three years af­ter the move­ment gripped most of the rest of the world. And the medium through which it ar­rived was tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>Ms Sofie Linde, a pop­u­lar TV host, stunned her au­di­ence at an awards show when she went off­script and spoke of an en­counter that took place when she was 18. She said a senior staff mem­ber or­dered her to per­form oral sex, or risk hav­ing her ca­reer de­railed.</p>
    <p>Ms Linde, who says she re­fused, trig­gered a flood of re­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>In the weeks that fol­lowed, hun­dreds of tes­ti­mo­ni­als were pub­lished in news­pa­pers and on so­cial me­dia, re­veal­ing sim­i­lar ex­pe­ri­ences in which young women across many pro­fes­sions spoke of be­ing the vic­tims of sex­ual ha­rass­ment.</p>
    <p>News­pa­per opinion col­umns were filled with com­men­taries on the out­pour­ing. Some were dis­mis­sive, some mock­ing, but many sug­gested that Den­mark was fac­ing a moment of reck­on­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Thorning-Sch­midt be­came prime min­is­ter in 2011, 96 years af­ter Dan­ish women got the vote. She says Dan­ish self-per­cep­tion has made it hard for the na­tion to be­lieve it is prone to the same forms of sex­ual abuse that the United States has seen. The for­mer premier also points to a wide­spread sus­pi­cion of po­lit­i­cal cor­rect­ness in Den­mark.</p>
    <p>Against that back­drop, Den­mark’s Par­lia­ment be­came an en­vi­ron­ment in which those in power were of­ten deaf to com­plaints by women, ac­cord­ing to al­le­ga­tions by its fe­male staff.</p>
    <p>Ms Kira Marie Peter-Hansen, a 22-year-old Dan­ish Mem­ber of the Euro­pean Par­lia­ment and one of the 322 sig­na­to­ries of the let­ter, says there has been a ten­dency to ac­cept sex­ual ha­rass­ment in Den­mark.</p>
    <p>“But my gen­er­a­tion has a clearer sense of where the bound­aries need to be,” she said by phone.</p>
    <p>We’ve long as­sumed that we’d achieved gen­der equal­ity. And be­cause of that, we as­sumed that there’s prob­a­bly no sex­ual ha­rass­ment.</p>
    <p>MS HELLE THORNING-SCH­MIDT, a for­mer prime min­is­ter and the first woman to lead Den­mark’s gov­ern­ment.</p>
