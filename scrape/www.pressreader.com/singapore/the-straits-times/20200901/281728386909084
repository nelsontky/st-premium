    <p>Den­nis Tan, Murali Pil­lai de­bate elec­tion in­ci­dents</p>
    <p>The heat of the July gen­eral elec­tion may have cooled but it seems to have left an im­print on WP’s Mr Den­nis Tan (Hougang) and the Peo­ple’s Action Party’s Mr Murali Pil­lai (Bukit Ba­tok).</p>
    <p>Both crossed swords over Sin­ga­pore’s po­lit­i­cal cul­ture as they re­vis­ited two in­ci­dents that al­legedly took place in Mr Tan’s sin­gle-mem­ber con­stituency dur­ing the polls.</p>
    <p>One in­volved two com­plaints to the Elec­tions De­part­ment (ELD) about posters WP put up that were said to be be­low the min­i­mum re­quired height, Mr Tan said. A res­i­dent later told him she had seen PAP rep­re­sen­ta­tives pulling his posters be­low the orig­i­nal height.</p>
    <p>On an­other oc­ca­sion, the PAP team planted party flags in front of his ban­ners, Mr Tan said. But, he added, it would be un­wise for the WP to do like­wise in ar­eas where the PAP is the in­cum­bent, lest a tit-for-tat cul­ture man­i­fests and cre­ates a di­vi­sive po­lit­i­cal cul­ture.</p>
    <p>To this, Mr Murali asked if Mr Tan would ac­cept that the ELD would deal with such com­plaints in an even-handed way, and ques­tioned the ba­sis of his sug­ges­tion that the PAP would use the power of in­cum­bency against op­po­nents in an un­fair way.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said he was not sug­gest­ing the PAP was us­ing the power of its in­cum­bency to do those things. Rather, the in­ci­dents demon­strate “very petty and bad pol­i­tics” that should not be en­cour­aged, he added. He also ac­knowl­edged the ELD had been even-handed in han­dling the com­plaints.</p>
