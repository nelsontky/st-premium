    <p>If oil market play­ers thought things could not get any worse after this hellish year, they might be in for a nasty sur­prise. Prices have hit rock bot­tom this year, but hopes of a re­cov­ery are be­ing clouded by fore­casts show­ing de­mand is un­likely to even match lev­els seen last year.</p>
    <p>If oil market play­ers thought things could not get any worse after this hellish year, then they might be in for a nasty sur­prise next year.</p>
    <p>Prices have hit rock bot­tom over the past 12 months, but hopes of a re­cov­ery are be­ing clouded by fore­casts show­ing de­mand is un­likely to even match lev­els seen last year.</p>
    <p>While bench­mark prices in the United States have surged about 34 per cent since the start of last month after news of the rapid roll­out of Covid-19 vac­cines sparked a re­lief rally, West Texas In­ter­me­di­ate (WTI) fu­tures failed to clear the highs seen this year, peak­ing at a level last seen in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>The world’s three ma­jor oil fore­cast­ers – the In­ter­na­tional En­ergy Agency (IEA), US En­ergy In­for­ma­tion Ad­min­is­tra­tion (EIA) and the Or­gan­i­sa­tion of the Pe­tro­leum Ex­port­ing Coun­tries (Opec) – have all re­duced their es­ti­mates for global oil de­mand next year to lev­els be­low last year’s.</p>
    <p>While there is lit­tle to sug­gest prices will plunge to this year’s un­prece­dented lev­els be­low zero US dol­lars a bar­rel, an­other round of lock­downs across Europe and the US is seen as a re­minder that the global econ­omy is still a long way from get­ting back to any­thing like nor­mal.</p>
    <p>With de­mand growth likely to re­main weak, the fo­cus is now on how ma­jor producers – grouped un­der the Opec+ um­brella – are go­ing to man­age global sup­ply. The un­prece­dented market slump had as much to do with their dis­agree­ment on out­put at the on­set of the pan­demic as with the lock­downs.</p>
    <p>When the out­break started in late Jan­uary, it seemed its im­pact would be lim­ited to China.</p>
    <p>That was dev­as­tat­ing enough as China is the top oil con­sumer.</p>
    <p>In March, just days be­fore the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion de­clared Covid-19 a pan­demic, top ex­porters Saudi Ara­bia and Rus­sia with­drew from a pro­duc­tion cut agree­ment they had stood by for more than three years.</p>
    <p>A price war en­sued among the Opec+ mem­bers, send­ing WTI plung­ing by more than 30 per cent in less than two weeks to its low­est level in 23 years.</p>
    <p>While there is lit­tle to sug­gest prices will plunge to this year’s un­prece­dented lev­els be­low zero US dol­lars a bar­rel, an­other round of lock­downs across Europe and the US is seen as a re­minder that the global econ­omy is still a long way from get­ting back to any­thing like nor­mal.</p>
    <p>Al­though the Opec+ re­grouped and agreed on a record 9.6 mil­lion bar­rel per day pro­duc­tion cut in April, it was seen as too late and too lit­tle to save the market from the ex­cep­tional crash.</p>
    <p>As the virus spread, so did lock­downs across the world and oil had vir­tu­ally nowhere to go ex­cept to over­flow­ing stor­age tanks and ships that were hired to hold ex­cess vol­umes.</p>
    <p>The record level of stor­age at Cush­ing in Ok­la­homa – the de­liv­ery point of WTI con­tracts – even­tu­ally sparked a sell-off that briefly sent prices on April 20 into neg­a­tive ter­ri­tory for the first time.</p>
    <p>The low was recorded at neg­a­tive US$37.63 a bar­rel.</p>
    <p>Phys­i­cal trade came to a halt, some traders – such as Hin Leong Trad­ing in Sin­ga­pore – went bank­rupt and fuel hedges by air­lines were wiped out.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines posted a record fuel hedg­ing loss of $563.6 mil­lion in the first half end­ing on Sept 30, al­though it lost way more in rev­enue from re­duced pas­sen­ger traf­fic amid widespread travel bans.</p>
    <p>Prices re­cov­ered as Opec+ sup­ply cuts started to draw down stock­piles. But even by the end of Oc­to­ber, stor­age in de­vel­oped na­tions was still above the peak reached dur­ing the 2016 surge that pre­ceded the for­ma­tion of Opec+.</p>
    <p>Even now, the IEA, EIA and Opec all see global oil de­mand in the first quar­ter of next year re­main­ing as much as 5 per cent be­low the level seen dur­ing the same pe­riod last year. Any quar­ter-on­quar­ter in­crease from this year is likely to be small, with the IEA see­ing no growth at all.</p>
    <p>It is clear that de­spite the vac­cine roll-out, it will take time to in­oc­u­late all work­ing-age peo­ple, de­lay­ing nor­mal­i­sa­tion of over­all eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity – in par­tic­u­lar in­ter­na­tional travel and lo­cal trans­port mo­bil­ity – and by ex­ten­sion de­mand for oil.</p>

This, to&#xAD;gether with the coro&#xAD;n&#xAD;avirus lock&#xAD;downs, led to the un&#xAD;prece&#xAD;dented oil slump.</p>
