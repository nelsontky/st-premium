    <p>WASHINGTON • The num­ber of coro­n­avirus cases in the United States neared seven mil­lion on Thurs­day – more than 20 per cent of the world’s to­tal – as Mid­west states re­ported spikes in Covid-19 in­fec­tions this month.</p>
    <p>The ap­proach­ing mile­stone comes days af­ter the na­tion sur­passed 200,000 Covid-19 deaths, the world’s high­est death toll from the virus. Each day, over 700 peo­ple die in the US from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>The US has now seen more than 6,978,000 coro­n­avirus cases and more than 202,800 deaths, ac­cord­ing to a tally by the Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity. Cal­i­for­nia leads the coun­try with more than 800,000 to­tal cases, fol­lowed by Texas, Florida and New York.</p>
    <p>All Mid­west states ex­cept Ohio re­ported more cases in the past four weeks com­pared with the prior four weeks, led by South Dakota and North Dakota.</p>
    <p>South Dakota had the big­gest per­cent­age in­crease at 166 per cent with more than 8,000 new cases, while North Dakota’s new cases dou­bled to about 8,700 com­pared with some 4,200 within the same time­frame last month.</p>
    <p>Many cases in th­ese two states have been linked to an an­nual mo­tor­cy­cle rally in Stur­gis, South Dakota, that at­tracts hun­dreds of thou­sands of vis­i­tors each year.</p>
    <p>Pos­i­tive cases rose in half of the 50 US states this month. Ten states have re­ported record one-day in­creases in in­fec­tions this month. New cases rose last week af­ter fall­ing for eight straight weeks.</p>
    <p>Health ex­perts be­lieve the spike was due to the re­open­ing of schools and uni­ver­si­ties, as well as par­ties over the re­cent Labour Day holiday.</p>
    <p>A study by US re­searchers said re­cent re­open­ing of col­lege and univer­sity cam­puses for in-per­son in­struc­tion dur­ing late sum­mer could be as­so­ci­ated with more than 3,000 ad­di­tional Covid-19 cases per day in the US in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>US con­firmed cases are the high­est glob­ally, fol­lowed by In­dia with more than 5.8 mil­lion cases and Brazil with more than 4.6 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The US is av­er­ag­ing 40,000 new in­fec­tions a day. Top US in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­pert Anthony Fauci has said he would like to see the num­ber fall be­low 10,000 a day be­fore the flu sea­son starts next month.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials and US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump have pre­sented dif­fer­ent views of the health cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, who is seek­ing re-elec­tion on Nov 3, this month claimed that the US was “round­ing the cor­ner” on the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Dr Fauci con­tra­dicted the claim the next day, say­ing the sta­tis­tics were dis­turb­ing.</p>
