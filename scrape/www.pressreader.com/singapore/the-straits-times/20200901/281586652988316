    <p>Sin­ga­pore aims to deepen col­lab­o­ra­tion with China’s Guang­dong prov­ince in sev­eral key ar­eas, in­clud­ing fi­nan­cial ser­vices, tal­ent ex­change and avi­a­tion.</p>
    <p>At the Sin­ga­pore-Guang­dong Col­lab­o­ra­tion Coun­cil meet­ing yes­ter­day, both sides pledged to work to­gether to strengthen eco­nomic re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore firms and their part­ners signed 15 agree­ments at the an­nual meet­ing, which was con­ducted by video con­fer­ence this year.</p>
    <p>Co-chaired by Sin­ga­pore Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung and Guang­dong Gov­er­nor Ma Xin­grui, it was the first pro­vin­cial busi­ness coun­cil meet­ing be­tween Sin­ga­pore and China to be con­vened amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong told the meet­ing there was scope for Sin­ga­pore and Guang­dong to work to­gether in green fi­nance, fi­nan­cial tech­nol­ogy, dis­as­ter risk in­sur­ance and Reit (real estate in­vest­ment trust) struc­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter also called for more tal­ent ex­changes be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Guang­dong.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong, who was pre­vi­ously ed­u­ca­tion min­is­ter, signed an agree­ment with China last year on the Youth In­terns Ex­change Scheme, which al­lows up to 500 Sin­ga­porean full-time stu­dents and re­cent grad­u­ates from uni­ver­si­ties and poly­tech­nics each year to se­cure visas for in­tern­ships with China-based com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>The agree­ment al­lowed for a re­cip­ro­cal ar­range­ment for Chi­nese stu­dents in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“We had hoped to see the first batch of in­tern­ship ex­changes ear­lier this year, but Covid-19 made this chal­leng­ing. Nonethe­less, with our Sin­ga­pore-China ‘fast lane’ in place, we hope to fa­cil­i­tate in­tern­ship ex­changes for stu­dents very soon, es­pe­cially with Guang­dong, once the im­ple­men­ta­tion agree­ment on (the scheme) is signed,” said Mr Ong.</p>
    <p>On avi­a­tion, Mr Ong noted that China is the first coun­try with which Sin­ga­pore launched a “fast lane” ar­range­ment for short-term and es­sen­tial travel. Sin­ga­pore is the first coun­try in South-east Asia with such an ar­range­ment with China.</p>
    <p>On the side­lines of the meet­ing, Mr Ong told re­porters that the quota of seats on flights un­der the fast lane ar­range­ment – in­clud­ing 500 seats across two flights per week be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Guang­dong’s cap­i­tal Guangzhou – was “very un­der­used”.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese are things that we will work on and of­fi­cials will dis­cuss in the com­ing months, and we hope we will have good progress,” he said.</p>
    <p>Be­sides th­ese ar­eas, Mr Ong noted that two bi­lat­eral projects – the China-Sin­ga­pore Guangzhou Knowl­edge City and the Sin­ga­poreChina (Shenzhen) Smart City Ini­tia­tive – have also made steady progress in the past year.</p>
    <p>This year marks the 10th an­niver­sary of the China-Sin­ga­pore Guangzhou Knowl­edge City, and Sin­ga­pore aims to part­ner the city in its long-term de­vel­op­ment in ar­eas such as ur­ban solutions and bio­med­i­cine.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, lo­cal med­i­cal tech­nol­ogy start-up Star3D Ma­te­rial De­vel­op­ment Com­pany signed a mem­o­ran­dum of un­der­stand­ing with the Sino-Sin­ga­pore Guangzhou Knowl­edge City In­vest­ment and De­vel­op­ment Co to fur­ther de­velop and com­mer­cialise the use of den­tal 3D tech­nol­ogy in China.</p>
    <p>The firm, which is based in Sin­ga­pore and has a fac­tory in Shang­hai, aims to set up a joint lab­o­ra­tory and re­search plat­form, and in­tro­duce projects in the dig­i­tal den­tal field, said gen­eral man­ager Chen Baiqun.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore-China (Shenzhen) Smart City Ini­tia­tive fo­cuses on three key ar­eas – dig­i­tal con­nec­tiv­ity, in­no­va­tion and en­trepreneur­ship, and tech tal­ent ex­change and de­vel­op­ment – and pro­motes greater ease of ac­cess to market op­por­tu­ni­ties in the Greater Bay Area and South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Guang­dong, China’s most pros­per­ous prov­ince, lies at the heart of the Greater Bay Area – a mega eco­nomic zone that com­prises nine cities in the prov­ince, Hong Kong and Ma­cau.</p>
    <p>Last year, bi­lat­eral trade be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Guang­dong grew 1.9 per cent year on year to reach US$19 bil­lion (S$25.8 bil­lion). In the first half of this year, bi­lat­eral trade reached US$8.06 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>There were more than 3,100 Sin­ga­pore projects in the prov­ince as of December last year, with cu­mu­la­tive in­vest­ments of US$13.1 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Be­yond the key cities of Guangzhou and Shenzhen, Sin­ga­pore busi­nesses have also ven­tured to new Greater Bay Area cities such as Huizhou, tap­ping op­por­tu­ni­ties in sec­tors like smart city solutions and fi­nan­cial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The busi­nesses in­clude Kep­pel Data Cen­tres, which is col­lab­o­rat­ing with China’s Coun­try Gar­den Hold­ings and Shenzhen Hu­ateng In­tel­li­gent Tech­nol­ogy to de­velop the Eco Smart data cen­tre project in Huizhou’s Tonghu Smart City.</p>
    <p>It is Kep­pel’s first green­field data cen­tre de­vel­op­ment in China, said a Kep­pel Data Cen­tres spokesman.</p>
