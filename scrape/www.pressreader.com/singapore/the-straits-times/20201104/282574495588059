    <p>•</p>
    <p>LON­DON Manch­ester United man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer has in­sisted he is sat­is­fied with the op­tions avail­able for ev­ery po­si­tion in his squad, after for­mer cap­tain and team­mate Roy Keane de­rided the cur­rent players as “nowhere near good enough”.</p>
    <p>After the Red Devils lost 1-0 to Arse­nal at Old Traf­ford on Sun­day, the pun­dit said: “Ole will lose his job work­ing with these players – that’s what is go­ing to hap­pen.”</p>
    <p>United have now suf­fered de­feats in three of their open­ing six Pre­mier League matches and sit 15th in the ta­ble but Sol­sk­jaer still be­lieves he has enough qual­ity to turn things around.</p>
    <p>“Roy has al­ways been out­spo­ken. I’m very glad that I’ve got the players that I have here with us,” Sol­sk­jaer told re­porters at his vir­tual pre­match press con­fer­ence be­fore they travel to Is­tan­bul Basak­se­hir for their Cham­pi­ons League Group H tie to­day.</p>
    <p>“We’ve got dif­fer­ent jobs. Roy’s job is to give his opin­ion. I al­ways lis­ten to Roy but we move on here with a great group of players, a strong group of players.</p>
    <p>“I’m sure we’ll see a re­sponse.” United skip­per Harry Maguire was equally pro­tec­tive of his team­mates at the same press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, claim­ing “we don’t bring the neg­a­tiv­ity into the place, we stay pos­i­tive”.</p>
    <p>On Keane’s crit­i­cism, the Eng­land de­fender said: “I haven’t seen his com­ments.</p>
    <p>“But we don’t look at what’s hap­pen­ing, es­pe­cially after a neg­a­tive re­sult... I can say, for sure, there are a lot of lead­ers in this squad.</p>
    <p>“I’m the cap­tain, I’ve got a lot of lead­er­ship around me as well, staff and players. So, for sure, there are a lot of lead­ers in this squad.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously, as the cap­tain I fo­cus more on the team than the in­di­vid­ual.</p>
    <p>“Since (los­ing 6-1 to Tot­ten­ham), we’ve been re­ally good and not con­ceded many chances at all.</p>
    <p>We feel like we’re on the right track and we’ve got the bal­ance right. The main thing is... com­ing into train­ing each day, try­ing to im­prove. We want to be con­sis­tent.”</p>
    <p>Sol­sk­jaer also de­fended Paul Pogba’s re­cent on-field strug­gles, say­ing the French­man re­mains on the right path to find­ing his best form at United.</p>
    <p>He con­ceded a penalty on Sun­day – the third time he has done so since Sol­sk­jaer has been in charge – leading pun­dits to ques­tion his fu­ture, es­pe­cially after a dis­ap­point­ing in­jury-hit 2019-20 sea­son.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Nor­we­gian still feels the French World Cup win</p>
    <p>ON THE WAY UP</p>
    <p>Since (los­ing 6-1 to Tot­ten­ham), we’ve been re­ally good and not con­ceded many chances at all. We feel like we’re on the right track</p>
    <p>and we’ve got the bal­ance right.</p>
    <p>HARRY MAGUIRE (left), United cap­tain, on stay­ing pos­i­tive after three losses in six league games.</p>
    <p>ner will come good, say­ing: “Ev­ery player is frus­trated after the de­feat. We need con­sis­tency from ev­ery one of our players.</p>
    <p>“Paul has had a dif­fi­cult pe­riod with in­jury, with Covid (he was in­fected ear­lier this term), so I think we have seen plenty of pos­i­tives.”</p>
    <p>De­spite their poor do­mes­tic run, United are en­joy­ing a bright start in the Cham­pi­ons League, win­ning their open­ing two matches against last sea­son’s fi­nal­ists Paris Saint-Ger­main and RB Leipzig.</p>
