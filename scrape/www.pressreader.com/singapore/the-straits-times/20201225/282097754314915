    <p>JEROME, WHO HAS BEEN TRY­ING TO HAVE A BABY FOR THREE YEARS WITH HIS WIFE.</p>
    <p>Over the last three years, Vanessa and Jerome (not their real names) have been try­ing to have a baby but a ge­netic con­di­tion has made it near im­pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean cou­ple, who were mar­ried in 2015, found out three years later that Jerome, 33, is a car­rier of bal­anced translo­ca­tion, a con­di­tion which re­sults in an un­usual re­arrange­ment of chro­mo­somes. While some­one with this con­di­tion usu­ally has no health prob­lems, it in­creases the risk of a mis­car­riage.</p>
    <p>Vanessa, a 31-year-old re­search co­or­di­na­tor, has had three mis­car­riages. Yet, de­ter­mined to have a child, she and Jerome, a busi­ness ex­ec­u­tive, have spent an es­ti­mated $100,000 on med­i­cal tests, treat­ments and in vitro fer­til­i­sa­tion (IVF) pro­ce­dures in Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia.</p>
    <p>About $35,000 to $40,000 alone has been spent on mul­ti­ple rounds of pre-im­plan­ta­tion ge­netic di­ag­no­sis (PGD), which tests em­bryos for a spe­cific ge­netic or chro­mo­so­mal ab­nor­mal­ity be­fore im­plan­ta­tion. Un­der this pro­ce­dure, only em­bryos found with­out the dis­or­der are im­planted in the woman.</p>
    <p>For the cou­ple, each IVF treat­ment must be ac­com­pa­nied by the PGD pro­ce­dure.</p>
    <p>How­ever, un­like IVF which is sub­sidised for Sin­ga­pore­ans, the cost of PGD pro­ce­dures is en­tirely borne by the cou­ple.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean cou­ples re­ceive sup­port from the Gov­ern­ment for IVF, with co-fund­ing of up to 75 per cent, for a max­i­mum of three fresh and three frozen cy­cles.</p>
    <p>But each PGD round can cost up to $15,000, which cov­ers the pro­duc­tion of a test kit and sub­se­quent em­bryo test­ing.</p>
    <p>Vanessa paid be­tween $8,000 and $10,000 in Sin­ga­pore for each PGD round, and about half the amount each time for the di­ag­no­sis in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Vanessa and Jerome’s jour­ney, which has been fi­nan­cially, phys­i­cally and emo­tion­ally drain­ing, re­flects the ex­pe­ri­ences of cou­ples who dis­cover they are car­ri­ers of ge­netic dis­or­ders while try­ing to con­ceive nat­u­rally.</p>
    <p>They are among more than 430 peo­ple who have signed an on­line pe­ti­tion – ini­ti­ated in Septem­ber – hop­ing the Gov­ern­ment would pro­vide some fi­nan­cial sup­port for PGD test­ing.</p>
    <p>Said Jerome: “We’ve been pay­ing for ev­ery­thing with our sav­ings. In be­tween the IVF cy­cles, we’re also try­ing to max­imise our chances (of hav­ing a child) with tra­di­tional Chi­nese medicine and sup­ple­ments.”</p>
    <p>The cou­ple will be go­ing for their sixth IVF cy­cle at a pub­lic hospi­tal here next month, and will be pay­ing for the PGD pro­ce­dure out of their own pocket again.</p>
    <p>“IVF is a very try­ing process, es­pe­cially for the woman, along with the ad­di­tional fi­nan­cial bur­den,” Jerome said. “It’s a cry­ing shame if cou­ples who re­ally want a child have to give up be­cause of fi­nances.”</p>
    <p>Nee Soon GRC MP Louis Ng, who held a di­a­logue ses­sion last month with cou­ples about their IVF con­cerns, said the cost of PGD was one of the top­ics raised.</p>
    <p>“A lot of them had gone through mul­ti­ple rounds of IVF. The gen­eral theme is that they all feel so stressed, and our poli­cies can af­ford to be more flex­i­ble, and more can be done to pro­vide fi­nan­cial or so­cio-emo­tional sup­port,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sofia (not her real name) has had two mis­car­riages as her hus­band is also a car­rier of bal­anced translo­ca­tion. The 31-year-old lawyer is start­ing her se­cond round of IVF and PGD next Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>“It’s not about ge­netic se­lec­tion. We just want to avoid end­less mis­car­riages, and min­imise the emo­tional, phys­i­cal and mone­tary dam­age in try­ing to have a child,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Full fund­ing for PGD may be im­pos­si­ble, but per­haps cou­ples can have some co-fund­ing, just like IVF sub­si­dies, or set up a fund for cou­ples proven to be ge­netic car­ri­ers to tap so that it won’t be abused.”</p>
    <p>IVF is a very try­ing process es­pe­cially for the woman, along with the ad­di­tional fi­nan­cial bur­den.</p>
    <p>It’s a cry­ing shame if cou­ples who re­ally want a child have to give up be­cause of fi­nances.</p>
    <p>’’ JEROME, (not his real name), on how he and his wife have spent an es­ti­mated $100,000 on med­i­cal tests, treat­ments and in vitro fer­til­i­sa­tion pro­ce­dures to try to have a baby.</p>
