    <p>Sin­ga­pore has weath­ered Covid-19 for over half a year, and the bat­tle against the virus is in­creas­ingly be­com­ing a men­tal one.</p>
    <p>Psy­cho­log­i­cal fa­tigue and a false sense of se­cu­rity are be­hind the crowds gath­er­ing at beaches, restau­rants and shops, say ex­perts.</p>
    <p>This is par­tic­u­larly since com­mu­nity cases re­main low de­spite many busi­nesses open­ing again.</p>
    <p>Af­ter months of fac­ing the strain of Covid-19, it is inevitable that in­di­vid­u­als start to let down their guard, be­come com­pla­cent, or sim­ply frus­trated, said Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health.</p>
    <p>And this can lead to care­less be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>This was clearly the case on Sun­day, when crowds gath­ered to watch Red Lions parachuter­s land at a grass patch next to Sengkang Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal, and some peo­ple ended up ar­gu­ing with safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors try­ing des­per­ately to main­tain the rules.</p>
    <p>While most Sin­ga­pore­ans are rule-abid­ing, there are al­ways those who push the bound­aries and take un­nec­es­sary risks, noted so­ci­ol­o­gist Pauline Straughan. This could be due to ei­ther ig­no­rance, or – when en­force­ment of­fi­cers are not around – “sim­ply be­cause they can”.</p>
    <p>She added: “I think in the be­gin­ning, most will be cau­tious when they ven­ture out.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, when this is nor­malised and es­pe­cially when noth­ing hap­pens when we re­sume so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties, many may tend to let their guard down. So what we need is con­stant re­minders, and rule en­force­ment to guard the bound­aries.”</p>
    <p>Prof Teo said to stem such be­hav­iour, pub­lic ed­u­ca­tion is para­mount, which means con­stant re­minders of what is risky and what is not.</p>
    <p>“By con­stantly be­ing in­formed about the sit­u­a­tion lo­cally, this can help in­di­vid­u­als to de­cide which ac­tiv­i­ties are now per­mit­ted be­cause the nec­es­sary pre­cau­tions are in place to make it safer, which ac­tiv­i­ties re­main at a higher risk and there­fore con­trolled, and which ac­tiv­i­ties are strictly dis­al­lowed be­cause the pos­si­bil­ity of com­mu­nity trans­mis­sions in these set­tings is ex­tremely high.”</p>
    <p>Equally im­por­tant is cul­ti­vat­ing a sense of re­straint and con­trol, he added.</p>
    <p>“For­bear­ance, by in­di­vid­u­als as well as by the en­forcers of rules and reg­u­la­tions, is im­por­tant,” he said. “If one does for­get to wear a mask or abide by safe dis­tanc­ing reg­u­la­tions gen­uinely, it’s im­por­tant that the pub­lic and en­forcers do not be too quick to cas­ti­gate... But of course, if one is clearly re­cal­ci­trant, then penal­ties and sanc­tions ought to ap­ply.”</p>
    <p>Added Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher, a se­nior con­sul­tant at the di­vi­sion of in­fec­tious dis­eases at Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal: “We need to learn to live with this virus. This re­quires com­mu­nity be­hav­iour to stay in line with all the guide­lines and rules.”</p>
    <p>An­other rea­son for the spike in cases in sev­eral coun­tries is the lift­ing of lock­downs pre­ma­turely.</p>
    <p>In­deed, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion has stressed that coun­tries should ease re­stric­tions only when they have put in place ad­e­quate sys­tems to track, trace and iso­late all cases in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>This has been a mis­step in some coun­tries. In the United States, for in­stance, in two-thirds of states, in­fec­tions were ris­ing when gov­er­nors started to ease lock­downs, ac­cord­ing to a re­port in The Econ­o­mist.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore ap­pears to have avoided this with its slow and care­ful en­try into the new nor­mal, car­ried out in phases and with the riski­est ac­tiv­i­ties still on hold for now.</p>
    <p>“The pace of re­open­ing in Sin­ga­pore is quite rea­son­able, when you con­sider what has hap­pened in coun­tries that re­opened too soon and too fast,” said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Alex Cook, vice-dean of re­search at the Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health.</p>
    <p>“This is es­pe­cially so when you con­sider that we still have large num­bers of cases be­ing iden­ti­fied in the</p>
