    <p>The ex­ten­sion of the Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS) to cover wages up to March next year is par­tic­u­larly im­por­tant and is a key com­po­nent of the lat­est sup­port pack­age for busi­nesses and work­ers, said Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob.</p>
    <p>By ex­tend­ing it in a cal­i­brated and sus­tain­able man­ner, Sin­ga­pore will hope­fully avoid a sud­den spike in re­trench­ments, she added.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, Madam Hal­imah said Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat had briefed her and the Coun­cil of Pres­i­den­tial Ad­vis­ers on the Govern­ment’s pro­posal to in­tro­duce a fifth sup­port pack­age as sig­nif­i­cant un­cer­tain­ties and chal­lenges remain ahead.</p>
    <p>The pack­age in­cludes, among other mea­sures, an ex­ten­sion of the JSS that varies by in­dus­try, with harder-hit sec­tors such as avi­a­tion, aero­space and tourism re­ceiv­ing the most sup­port at 50 per cent wage lev­els for seven more months.</p>
    <p>A few sec­tors that are man­ag­ing rel­a­tively well, such as bio­med­i­cal sciences and fi­nan­cial ser­vices, will re­ceive 10 per cent wage sup­port for four more months.</p>
    <p>Madam Hal­imah said the JSS ex­ten­sion will pro­vide con­tin­ued sup­port for busi­nesses and work­ers amid a weak eco­nomic en­vi­ron­ment, but she cau­tioned that not ev­ery firm can be saved.</p>
    <p>“We can’t save ev­ery busi­ness, and we have to be pre­pared that there may still be more job losses in the next few months,” said Madam Hal­imah.</p>
    <p>“But by con­tin­u­ing the JSS sup­port in a more cal­i­brated and sus­tain­able man­ner, we will hope­fully avoid a sud­den spike in re­trench­ments. This will give us more time to cre­ate new qual­ity jobs, and for work­ers to reskill for their new roles.”</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent added that the fifth sup­port pack­age will be fully funded from the repri­ori­ti­sa­tion of re­sources and does not re­quire an ad­di­tional draw from past re­serves be­yond what she had ear­lier given ap­proval for.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment has ded­i­cated close to $100 bil­lion over four budgets since Fe­bru­ary to sup­port work­ers and busi­nesses through the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Hal­imah had ear­lier given ap­proval for draw­ing up to $52 bil­lion from the past re­serves to fund these mea­sures.</p>
