    <p>Two for­mer Nom­i­nated MPs (NMP) – so­cial en­tre­pre­neur Anthea Ong and Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Orches­tra ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Ter­ence Ho – are seek­ing a sec­ond term in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Other new can­di­dates who have sub­mit­ted their ap­pli­ca­tions in­clude Mr Jo­hann An­nuar, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion En­gi­neer­ing Good; com­mu­nity artist Ter­ence Tan; play­wright and poet Na­bi­lah Said; and ac­tress and event host Au­drey Lim.</p>
    <p>The NMP scheme was in­tro­duced in 1990 to en­sure a wide rep­re­sen­ta­tion of views in Par­lia­ment. There can be up to nine NMPs each term, last­ing 21/ years.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>Mr Jo­hann, whose or­gan­i­sa­tion helps dis­ad­van­taged groups in the com­mu­nity by pro­vid­ing them with ac­cess to tech­nol­ogy, sub­mit­ted his papers just be­fore the sub­mis­sion dead­line of 4.30pm yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He told The Straits Times that he hopes to speak up on re­duc­ing inequal­ity if se­lected, par­tic­u­larly on dig­i­tal in­clu­sion and for groups such as people with dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“We have done very well in mak­ing our coun­try prosperous and with that comes a re­spon­si­bil­ity to help the more dis­ad­van­taged in our com­mu­nity, to bring them up to a level at which they can give their best,” he added.</p>
    <p>A spe­cial com­mit­tee of eight MPs chaired by Speaker of Par­lia­ment Tan Chuan-Jin will con­sider the ap­pli­ca­tions, agree on the fi­nal nom­i­nees and rec­om­mend them to the Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Vet­eran union leader Ab­dul Sa­mad Ab­dul Wa­hab has been nom­i­nated as the labour move­ment’s choice for NMP, while re­search sci­en­tist Andie Ang from the Wildlife Re­serves Sin­ga­pore Con­ser­va­tion Fund has been put up by Sin­ga­pore’s green groups.</p>
    <p>Mr Ter­ence Tan, Ms Na­bi­lah and Ms Lim, who were on a short­list put up by the arts com­mu­nity af­ter an on­line town­hall on Nov 18, have also sub­mit­ted their ap­pli­ca­tions. The three, along with Mr Ho – the for­mer arts NMP – are seek­ing to rep­re­sent the arts sec­tor as an NMP.</p>
    <p>The town­hall was or­gan­ised by a group of vol­un­teers called the Arts NMP Sec­re­tariat. It launched an on­line cam­paign af­ter the town­hall, which gar­nered 1,993 valid re­sponses in sup­port of the can­di­dates from 1,686 re­spon­dents.</p>
    <p>Close to 60 per cent of re­spon­dents backed Ms Na­bi­lah. An­other 25 per cent sup­ported Ms Lim, and 13 per cent backed Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>In 2018, artists Woon Tien Wei and Fe­li­cia Low sub­mit­ted their names to Par­lia­ment af­ter a town­hall or­gan­ised by the Arts NMP Sec­re­tariat. Mr Ho, who did not go through the com­mu­nity nom­i­na­tion process, was even­tu­ally ap­pointed as the arts NMP.</p>
    <p>Mr Ho Meng Kit, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion, said it has sub­mit­ted nom­i­na­tions for can­di­dates to rep­re­sent the busi­ness and in­dus­try sec­tor. “They are all ex­cel­lent can­di­dates who will be able to rep­re­sent the busi­ness com­mu­nity,” he said, de­clin­ing to give more de­tails.</p>
    <p>Com­mu­ni­ca­tion and tech­nol­ogy pro­fes­sor Lim Sun Sun, phar­ma­cist Irene Quay and Par­a­lympian swim­mer Yip Pin Xiu will not seek a sec­ond term as NMP. Labour economist Wal­ter Th­e­seira de­clined to say whether he is do­ing so.</p>
    <p>“Par­lia­ment doesn’t re­lease in­for­ma­tion about prospec­tive can­di­dates un­less they are ac­tu­ally nom­i­nated. I have come to agree that this can be use­ful in en­cour­ag­ing people to put their name for­ward for con­sid­er­a­tion, al­though it may run counter to ex­pec­ta­tions for trans­parency. I pre­fer to fol­low the cur­rent process by not com­ment­ing,” he said.</p>
