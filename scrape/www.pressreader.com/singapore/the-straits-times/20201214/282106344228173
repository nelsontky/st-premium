    <p>Mr Jack Sim’s days are num­bered.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean busi­ness man turned-san­i­ta­tion cham­pion runs a countdown app on his phone with an “ex­piry date” set for March 3, 2037, when he turns 80.</p>
    <p>As of to­day, he has 5,924 days left to be, as he says, a use­ful per­son.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing founded in Novem­ber 2001 the non-profit World Toi­let Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO), which he con­ser­va­tively es­ti­mates as hav­ing had an im­pact on a bil­lion peo­ple world­wide, Mr Sim is now – at 63 – also de­vot­ing his en­er­gies to the larger agenda of global poverty.</p>
    <p>Some may dis­miss him as an odd­ball with cash to burn, but vet­eran diplo­mat Tommy Koh de­scribes Mr Sim as a “trea­sure of Sin­ga­pore and the world” in his con­grat­u­la­tory mes­sage for a book to mark the WTO’s 20th an­niver­sary next year.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Koh was in­ducted into the WTO’s Hall of Fame last week, along­side Swedish diplo­mat Jan Ken­neth Elias­son, United Na­tions of­fi­cial Uschi Eid of Ger­many and Ja­panese non-profit, The Nip­pon Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>“I’m very grate­ful to Jack for this recog­ni­tion of my small ef­forts to make avail­able mod­ern san­i­ta­tion to all the peo­ple of the world,” Prof Koh, who co-chairs the Asian De­vel­op­ment Bank’s ad­vi­sory com­mit­tee on wa­ter and san­i­ta­tion, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Mr Sim re­calls how the Am­bas­sador-at-Large’s sup­port from the start – in­clud­ing in­tro­duc­ing him to key UN mem­bers – even­tu­ally led to the world body, in 2013, des­ig­nat­ing Nov 19 as its of­fi­cial World Toi­let Day.</p>
    <p>Hail­ing this as a turn­ing point in con­fer­ring le­git­i­macy on the WTO and its cause, Mr Sim points out that am­bi­tious na­tional toi­let projects in In­dia and China were launched soon af­ter, en­dorsed by Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi and Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping.</p>
    <p>Mr Sim’s ef­forts to raise aware­ness, through events and tire­less lob­by­ing of pub­lic and pri­vate sec­tor forces world­wide, are aided by a glut of me­dia cov­er­age cen­tred on his un­abashed per­sona.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes a fea­ture-length doc­u­men­tary ti­tled Mr Toi­let: The World’s #2 Man.</p>
    <p>The WTO runs on spon­sor­ships and do­na­tions, with about $2 mil­lion gar­nered over the last two decades go­ing into op­er­at­ing costs like the salaries of two staff.</p>
    <p>Mr Sim does not ex­pect his four chil­dren – named Faith, Earth, Truth, Worth, all in their 20s – or any Sin­ga­porean, for that mat­ter, to fol­low in his foot­steps.</p>
    <p>But there is no time to dwell on that, he says, given the ur­gency to solve an­other, more press­ing global prob­lem: poverty.</p>
    <p>To that end, Mr Sim has founded a non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion to sup­port busi­nesses in com­mu­ni­ties that are at what he terms the “base of the pyra­mid”, and put $10 mil­lion into build­ing a fa­cil­ity in the Ubi area that he en­vi­sions as a fu­ture “World Trade Cen­tre for the poor”.</p>
    <p>Last month, he signed a mem­o­ran­dum of un­der­stand­ing with NUS En­ter­prise – the en­tre­pre­neur­ial arm of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore – to col­lab­o­rate on so­cial in­no­va­tion projects.</p>
    <p>“Isn’t it ridicu­lous, that with even fewer days left (to turn­ing 80) com­pared with when I started the WTO, I want to achieve an even big­ger im­pact?” he muses.</p>
    <p>“But there’s only one life­time, and I don’t have much time left to serve.”</p>
    <p>Mor­tal­ity, with the clock tick­ing down in his pocket, is ev­i­dently Mr Sim’s driv­ing force.</p>
    <p>The goal is as sim­ple as try­ing to leave be­hind a world bet­ter than be­fore, he says.</p>
    <p>And fix­ing a date for his de­par­ture, even if it is just a sym­bolic one, has helped him go about that fear­lessly while also search­ing for an­swers to a ques­tion he asks him­self daily: “What do you want to say to your­self on the last day of your life?”</p>
