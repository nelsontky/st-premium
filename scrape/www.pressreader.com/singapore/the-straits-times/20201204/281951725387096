    <p>US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s eco­nomic team, an­nounced this week, com­prises a di­verse group of sea­soned pro­fes­sion­als who are likely to pur­sue ac­tivist and ex­pan­sion­ary eco­nomic poli­cies, which is ex­actly what the Amer­i­can econ­omy needs. The most im­por­tant ap­point­ment is that of Dr Janet Yellen as the Trea­sury Sec­re­tary-des­ig­nate. If con­firmed, she will have the dis­tinc­tion of be­ing the first woman to hold that po­si­tion and the first in­di­vid­ual to have also served as the chair­man of the United States Fed­eral Re­serve.</p>
    <p>Dr Yellen has lost no time in call­ing for ur­gent eco­nomic ac­tion to pre­vent a self-re­in­forc­ing down­turn, which will cause “more dev­as­ta­tion”. Fore­cast to con­tract by about 4 per cent this year, the US econ­omy is fac­ing a spi­ralling Covid-19 pan­demic that threat­ens to deepen its re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>Dr Yellen and her team will likely fo­cus, first, on re­duc­ing un­em­ploy­ment, which is run­ning at an el­e­vated rate of close to 7 per cent, com­pared with around 4 per cent be­fore the pan­demic. They will also aim for ma­jor in­vest­ments in in­fra­struc­ture, green en­ergy, reskilling, ed­u­ca­tion and R&D, which are the key eco­nomic pri­or­i­ties of the in­com­ing Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>All of this will re­quire fis­cal ex­pan­sion on a large scale. But the po­ten­tial size of the US fis­cal stim­u­lus is still un­cer­tain. The Democrats want at least a US$2 tril­lion (S$2.7 tril­lion) stim­u­lus, but the Repub­li­cans – who con­trol the Se­nate – favour a much smaller num­ber. A com­pro­mise bi­par­ti­san pro­posal of a US$908 bil­lion spend­ing pack­age might be ap­proved be­fore the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion takes of­fice. But the even­tual size of the stim­u­lus – as well as the fate of other eco­nomic mea­sures – will de­pend on the bal­ance of power in the Se­nate, which will turn on the re­sults of two runoff races in the state of Ge­or­gia early next month.</p>
    <p>The Bi­den eco­nomic team also favours tax in­creases, both on in­di­vid­u­als and com­pa­nies. But re­vers­ing the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s tax cuts will be re­sisted by the Repub­li­cans. As a re­sult, a larger part of any stim­u­lus would need to be mon­e­tised by the Fed­eral Re­serve, lead­ing to fur­ther huge in­jec­tions of liq­uid­ity as well as fis­cal deficits and higher lev­els of debt, for which fi­nan­cial mar­kets would need to be pre­pared.</p>
    <p>As Trea­sury Sec­re­tary, Dr Yellen will also play a ma­jor role in shap­ing US trade poli­cies. While she is un­likely to em­brace a free-trade agenda, she will likely over­turn many of the pro­tec­tion­ist poli­cies of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion – in­clud­ing tar­iffs on US al­lies and China which hurt US busi­nesses and con­sumers. She will also likely sup­port the re­vi­tal­i­sa­tion of the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion and in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>Tak­ing charge amid a pub­lic health and eco­nomic cri­sis, Dr Yellen’s steady hand at the helm of US eco­nomic pol­i­cy­mak­ing would be a wel­come change from the past four years.</p>
