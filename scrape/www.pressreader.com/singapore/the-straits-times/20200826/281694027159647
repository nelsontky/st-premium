    <p>AM­S­TER­DAM/BRUS­SELS/HONG KONG • Two Euro­pean pa­tients are con­firmed to have been re­in­fected with the coronaviru­s, ac­cord­ing to re­gional public broad­cast­ers, rais­ing con­cerns about peo­ple’s im­mu­nity to the virus as the world strug­gles to tame the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The news comes as re­searchers in Hong Kong re­ported a man there had been re­in­fected 41/ months af</p>
    <p>2 ter be­ing de­clared re­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>That has fu­elled fears about the ef­fec­tive­ness of po­ten­tial vac­cines against the virus, though ex­perts say there would need to be many more cases of re­in­fec­tion for these to be jus­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal me­dia said yes­ter­day a pa­tient in the Nether­lands and an­other in Bel­gium had been re­in­fected with the virus.</p>
    <p>Dutch broad­caster NOS cited vi­rol­o­gist Mar­ion Koop­mans as say­ing that the pa­tient in the Nether­lands was an older per­son with a weak­ened im­mune sys­tem.</p>
    <p>She said cases where peo­ple have been sick with the virus a long time be­fore it flares up are bet­ter known.</p>
    <p>But a true re­in­fec­tion, as in the Dutch, Bel­gian and Hong Kong cases, re­quires ge­netic test­ing of the virus in both the first and sec­ond in­fec­tions to see whether the two in­stances of the virus dif­fer slightly.</p>
    <p>Dr Koop­mans, an ad­viser to the Dutch gov­ern­ment, said re­in­fec­tions had been ex­pected.</p>
    <p>“That some­one would pop up with a re­in­fec­tion, it doesn’t make me ner­vous,” she said. “We have to see whether it hap­pens of­ten.”</p>
    <p>Dutch health min­istry of­fi­cials did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Bel­gian vi­rol­o­gist Marc Van Ranst told Bel­gian broad­caster VRT he had not been sur­prised by the Hong Kong re­in­fec­tion case.</p>
    <p>“For us, it was not news be­cause we have also had such a case in Bel­gium,” he said.</p>
    <p>That case was a woman who had con­tracted Covid-19 in March and for a sec­ond time in June.</p>
    <p>Dr Van Ranst said in cases such as the Bel­gian woman’s in which the Covid-19 symp­toms were rel­a­tively mild, the body may not have cre­ated enough an­ti­bod­ies to pre­vent a re­in­fec­tion, though they might have helped limit the sick­ness.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers at the Univer­sity of Hong Kong said that find­ings from the re­in­fec­tion case in the city in­di­cate that the dis­ease, which has killed more than 800,000 peo­ple world­wide, may con­tinue to spread among the global pop­u­la­tion de­spite herd im­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old man was cleared of Covid-19 and dis­charged from a hos­pi­tal in April, but tested pos­i­tive again af­ter re­turn­ing from Spain via Bri­tain on Aug 15.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers used ge­nomic se­quence anal­y­sis to prove that he had been in­fected by two dif­fer­ent strains.</p>
    <p>The man, who works in in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy, did not develop any symp­toms from his sec­ond in­fec­tion, which might in­di­cate that any “sub­se­quent in­fec­tions may be milder”, the re­searchers said.</p>
    <p>“Our find­ings sug­gest that SarsCoV-2 may per­sist in hu­mans,” Dr Yuen Kwok-yung and his colleagues said in a pa­per ac­cepted for pub­li­ca­tion in the jour­nal Clin­i­cal In­fec­tious Dis­eases.</p>
    <p>The find­ings, how­ever, do not mean that vac­cines will be use­less, said Dr To Kai-wang, one of the lead­ing authors of the pa­per.</p>
    <p>“Im­mu­nity in­duced by vac­ci­na­tion can be dif­fer­ent from those in­duced by nat­u­ral in­fec­tion,” Dr To said, adding that re­sults of vac­cine tri­als will be needed to see how ef­fec­tive vac­cines are.</p>
    <p>World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion epi­demi­ol­o­gist Maria Van Kerkhove said on Monday there was no need to jump to any con­clu­sions in re­sponse to the Hong Kong case.</p>
    <p>In­stances of peo­ple dis­charged from hos­pi­tals and test­ing pos­i­tive again for Covid-19 in­fec­tion have been re­ported in main­land China.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in those cases, it was not clear whether they had con­tracted the virus again af­ter full re­cov­ery – as had hap­pened to the Hong Kong pa­tient – or still had the virus in their body from the ini­tial in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The pre­lim­i­nary num­ber of pa­tients in China who tested pos­i­tive again af­ter be­ing dis­charged from hos­pi­tal was 5 per cent to 15 per cent, in­fec­tious dis­eases spe­cial­ist Wang Guiqiang, from China’s ex­pert group for Covid-19 treat­ment, said dur­ing a me­dia brief­ing in May.</p>
    <p>One ex­pla­na­tion was that the virus still ex­isted in the lungs of pa­tients but was not de­tected in sam­ples taken from the up­per parts of the res­pi­ra­tory tract, he said.</p>
    <p>Other pos­si­ble causes were low sen­si­tiv­ity of tests and weak im­mu­nity that could lead to per­sis­tent pos­i­tive re­sults.</p>
