    <p>COLOGNE (Ger­many) • Manch­ester United have little time to dwell on their third semi-fi­nal de­feat in a sin­gle sea­son af­ter Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer ad­mit­ted they let Sevilla “off the hook” and will now miss Fri­day’s Europa League fi­nal.</p>
    <p>The Red Devils were des­per­ate for a tro­phy and the English Premier League club’s first since 2017, as tan­gi­ble re­ward for the im­prove­ment they have made this year and to ce­ment the Nor­we­gian’s status as the man to lead them for­ward.</p>
    <p>While they suf­fered a 2-1 de­feat on Sun­day, it was just United’s sec­ond loss in 25 games – a run which has at least en­sured a re­turn to the Cham­pi­ons League next sea­son.</p>
    <p>The much-needed in­come that will bring, even for a com­mer­cial be­he­moth, is par­tic­u­larly wel­come given the eco­nomic im­pact of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and will help as Sol­sk­jaer aims to build a squad ca­pa­ble of tak­ing the Premier League ti­tle fight to Liver­pool and Manch­ester City next sea­son.</p>
    <p>United’s progress and prob­lems were on show in equal mea­sure in their 59th game of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>Bruno Fer­nan­des con­tin­ued his per­fect record out of eight at­tempts from the spot since his Jan­uary sign­ing to give them an early lead.</p>
    <p>Even af­ter former Liver­pool for­ward Suso equalised for Sevilla, United should have been out of sight early in the sec­ond half.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Sol­sk­jaer’s men were waste­ful as Bono de­nied An­thony Mar­tial three times in one-on-one sit­u­a­tions, while Fer­nan­des and Mar­cus Rash­ford also saw chances come and go. That the Morocco goal­keeper was the La Liga side’s hero with eight saves shows that on an­other evening, United would have won com­fort­ably. But their coach Julen Lopetegui turned to his bench to change the game, with sub­sti­tute Luuk de Jong ghost­ing in be­hind Vic­tor Lin­de­lof to net the win­ner 12 min­utes from time.</p>
    <p>The slack de­fend­ing led to an on­field bust up be­tween Fer­nan­des and the Swe­den in­ter­na­tional and af­ter­wards, Sol­sk­jaer ad­mit­ted that he would “need to strengthen the squad depth” this trans­fer win­dow.</p>
    <p>United will be back in pre-sea­son train­ing in two weeks and could be­gin their Premier League cam­paign in less than a month.</p>
    <p>With three other com­pe­ti­tions on top of in­ter­na­tion­als crammed into an eight-month cal­en­dar, new faces are a must to bol­ster their chances of sil­ver­ware next term.</p>
    <p>“We are look­ing at it,” Sol­sk­jaer said of trans­fers. “It is a quick turn­around. We just have to be 100 per cent sure when we do those deals.”</p>
    <p>Lin­de­lof’s er­ror also high­lighted the need for a more re­li­able part­ner for Harry Maguire, with pun­dit and former United mid­fielder Paul Sc­holes in­sist­ing that a “dom­i­nant de­fender is needed to cover for the slight weak­nesses”.</p>
    <p>Eng­land in­ter­na­tional Maguire, the world’s most ex­pen­sive de­fender at £80 mil­lion (S$143.3 mil­lion), was dis­ap­pointed at the way his de­but sea­son ended tro­phy­less.</p>
    <p>“We know what it means to play for this club, los­ing isn’t ac­cept­able. Get­ting to semi-fi­nals isn’t ac­cept­able,” he said. “We’ve got to now re­ally con­cen­trate on tak­ing it fur­ther, tak­ing an­other step.”</p>
