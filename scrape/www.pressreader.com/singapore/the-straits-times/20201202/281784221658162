    <p>LON­DON • A type of Covid-19 test that can be taken with­out the need for a nose or throat swab has been found to be highly ef­fec­tive in iden­ti­fy­ing in­fec­tious cases, in­clud­ing for peo­ple not show­ing symp­toms, the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The RT-Lamp tests, made by pri­vately held Bri­tish com­pany OptiGene, have been stud­ied in a pi­lot pro­gramme in the south­ern English city of Southamp­ton, where they were used to test some health ser­vice staff, as well as 55,000 peo­ple con­nected to the lo­cal univer­sity.</p>
    <p>“We’ve shown through care­fully con­ducted stud­ies that the OptiGene Lamp test is fast, re­li­able and easy to use, and, de­pen­dent on test­ing for­mat, can work di­rectly with saliva sam­ples as well as with swabs,” said Dr Sue Hill, chief sci­en­tific of­fi­cer for Eng­land in the Na­tional Health Ser­vice’s Test and Trace pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Lamp is short for loop-me­di­ated isother­mal am­pli­fi­ca­tion, the tech­nol­ogy used to process the tests. The Lamp tests can pro­duce re­sults more rapidly than the com­monly used gold stan­dard PCR tests. The Lamp tests were found to have a sen­si­tiv­ity of 79 per cent and speci­ficity of 100 per cent, mean­ing they were ef­fec­tive in iden­ti­fy­ing the peo­ple who were in­fec­tious and most likely to trans­mit the disease.</p>
