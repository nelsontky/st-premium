    <p>LIMA • Peru’s best-known tourist site Machu Pic­chu has opened af­ter months of clo­sure, but for just one vis­i­tor – a Ja­panese man stranded in the coun­try by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“The first per­son on Earth who went to Machu Pic­chu since the lock­down is meeeeeee,” Mr Jesse Katayama posted on his In­sta­gram ac­count along­side pic­tures of him­self at the de­serted site.</p>
    <p>“This is truly amaz­ing! Thank you,” he said in a video posted on the Face­book pages of the lo­cal tourism author­ity in Cusco, where the famed site is lo­cated.</p>
    <p>Mr Katayama spoke against the back­drop of the ma­jes­tic moun­tain­top dot­ted with an­cient ruins that once at­tracted thou­sands of tourists a day but has been closed since March be­cause of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese box­ing in­struc­tor, iden­ti­fied as a 26-year-old from</p>
    <p>Nara, has been stuck in Peru since March, when he bought a ticket for the tourist site days be­fore the coun­try de­clared a health emer­gency.</p>
    <p>He had planned to spend three days in the area, but with flights can­celled and move­ment lim­ited, he ended up stuck there for months.</p>
    <p>Even­tu­ally, his plight reached the lo­cal tourism author­ity, which granted him spe­cial per­mis­sion to visit the Inca city, re­open­ing the site just for him.</p>
    <p>“I thought that I wouldn’t be able to go, but thanks to all of you who pleaded with the mayor and the gov­ern­ment, I was given this su­per spe­cial op­por­tu­nity,” he wrote in Ja­panese on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>Machu Pic­chu is the most en­dur­ing legacy of the Inca em­pire that ruled a large swathe of western South Amer­ica for 100 years.</p>
