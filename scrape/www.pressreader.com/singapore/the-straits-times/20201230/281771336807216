    <p>LONDON • Bri­tain must vac­ci­nate two mil­lion peo­ple a week to avoid a third wave of the coro­n­avirus out­break, a study by the London School of Hy­giene and Trop­i­cal Medicine has con­cluded.</p>
    <p>The coun­try re­ported a daily high of 41,385 new Covid-19 cases on Mon­day. There were 357 new deaths within 28 days of a pos­i­tive test. Over­all, it has recorded more than 71,000 Covid-19 deaths and over 2.3 mil­lion in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>“The most strin­gent in­ter­ven­tion sce­nario with tier 4 (re­stric­tions) Eng­land-wide and schools closed dur­ing Jan­uary and two mil­lion in­di­vid­u­als vac­ci­nated per week, is the only sce­nario we con­sid­ered which re­duces peak ICU (in­ten­sive care unit) bur­den below the lev­els seen dur­ing the first wave,” the study said.</p>
    <p>It added: “In the ab­sence of sub­stan­tial vac­cine roll­out, cases, hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions, ICU ad­mis­sions and deaths in 2021 may ex­ceed those in 2020.”</p>
    <p>An ac­cel­er­ated up­take of two mil­lion vac­ci­nated a week “is pre­dicted to have a much more sub­stan­tial im­pact”, ac­cord­ing to the study, which has yet to be peer-re­viewed.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to the study, a Health De­part­ment spokesman said that “over the com­ing weeks and months, the rate of vac­ci­na­tion will in­crease as mil­lions more doses be­come avail­able and the pro­gramme con­tin­ues to ex­pand”.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish gov­ern­ment has se­cured early ac­cess to 357 mil­lion vac­cines doses through agree­ments with sev­eral de­vel­op­ers.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son and his sci­en­tific ad­vis­ers have said a vari­ant of the coro­n­avirus, which could be up to 70 per cent more trans­mis­si­ble, is spread­ing rapidly in Bri­tain, though it is not thought to be more deadly or to cause more se­ri­ous ill­ness.</p>
    <p>That prompted tight social mix­ing re­stric­tion mea­sures for London and south-east Eng­land, while plans to ease curbs over Christ­mas across the na­tion were dra­mat­i­cally scaled back or scrapped al­to­gether.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son had said last week that the spread of a new Covid-19 vari­ant meant there would be dif­fi­cult times ahead. And min­is­ters have said it may be nec­es­sary to do more.</p>
    <p>“This very high level of in­fec­tion is of grow­ing con­cern at a time when our hos­pi­tals are at their most vul­ner­a­ble,” said Dr Yvonne Doyle, med­i­cal di­rec­tor at Pub­lic Health Eng­land.</p>
    <p>Me­dia re­ports over the week­end said Bri­tain will roll out the vac­cine from Ox­ford-As­traZeneca from Jan 4, with ap­proval by the coun­try’s med­i­cal reg­u­la­tor ex­pected within days.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, Bri­tain be­came the first coun­try in the world to roll out the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine. The Bri­tish gov­ern­ment said l ast Thurs­day that 600,000 peo­ple had re­ceived the first dose of that vac­cine.</p>
