    <p>LON­DON • Manch­ester United striker Edin­son Ca­vani has ac­cepted the three-game ban handed to him by the Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (FA) for us­ing a ra­cial term and said that while he did not agree with the gov­ern­ing body’s as­sess­ment of his com­ment, his heart was at peace.</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old Uruguayan pro­duced a match-win­ning dis­play at Southamp­ton on Nov 29, pro­vid­ing an as­sist for Bruno Fer­nan­des be­fore net­ting two goals in a 3-2 come­back win. He has four goals in 14 ap­pear­ances this term.</p>
    <p>The sum­mer sign­ing then used the Span­ish word “negrito”(small black per­son) in an In­sta­gram post af­ter the vic­tory, be­fore tak­ing it down and apol­o­gis­ing.</p>
    <p>He said the term had a friendly con­no­ta­tion when used in South Amer­ica and was in­tended as an ex­pres­sion of af­fec­tion to a friend.</p>
    <p>But the FA on Thurs­day said the com­ment was “im­proper and</p>
    <p>I want to share with you that I ac­cept the dis­ci­plinary sanc­tion know­ing that I am for­eign to English lan­guage cus­toms, but I do not share the point of view.</p>
    <p>brought the game into dis­re­pute”, fined Ca­vani £100,000 (S$180,800) and or­dered him to com­plete “face-to-face ed­u­ca­tion” as part of his pun­ish­ment.</p>
    <p>“A com­ment posted on the Manch­ester United FC striker’s In­sta­gram page was in­sult­ing, abu­sive, im­proper and brought the game into dis­re­pute,” the FA said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“The post also con­sti­tutes an ‘ag­gra­vated breach’... as it in­cluded ref­er­ence, whether ex­press or im­plied, to colour and/or race and/or eth­nic ori­gin.”</p>
    <p>United said Ca­vani chose not to con­test the charge out of re­spect for the FA and the “fight against racism in foot­ball”, with the Uruguayan post­ing an apol­ogy on so­cial me­dia late on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“I do not want to ex­tend much in this un­com­fort­able mo­ment,” Ca­vani wrote on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>“I want to share with you that I ac­cept the dis­ci­plinary sanc­tion know­ing that I am for­eign to English lan­guage cus­toms, but I do not share the point of view.</p>
    <p>“I apol­o­gise if I of­fended some­one with an ex­pres­sion of af­fec­tion to­wards a friend, noth­ing fur­ther in my in­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>“Those who know me know that my ef­fort al­ways seeks the sim­plest joy and friend­ship!</p>
    <p>“I ap­pre­ci­ate the count­less expression­s of sup­port and af­fec­tion. My heart is at peace be­cause I know that I al­ways ex­pressed my­self with af­fec­tion ac­cord­ing to my cul­ture and way of life.</p>
    <p>“I send you a sin­cere hug.” Ca­vani missed United’s league game against As­ton Villa yes­ter­day, and will also not be able to fea­ture in the League Cup semi-fi­nal against Manch­ester City and the FA Cup match against Wat­ford as a re­sult of the sus­pen­sion.</p>
    <p>United also said they hoped the in­de­pen­dent reg­u­la­tory com­mis­sion ap­pointed to de­cide the sanc­tion would make it clear, in its writ­ten rea­sons, that the for­mer Paris Saint-Ger­main player “is not a racist, nor was there any racist in­tent in re­la­tion to his post”.</p>
    <p>EDIN­SON CA­VANI, Manch­ester United for­ward, wants to move on from the con­tro­versy.</p>
