    <p>Over the last few days, the grapevine was work­ing over­time and rumour mon­gers were hav­ing a field day.</p>
    <p>They had swooped from the trees, telling ev­ery­one who would lis­ten that Vlad Duric was jump­ing ship.</p>
    <p>The champ, they said, was leav­ing Sin­ga­pore – even though the Sin­ga­pore Turf Club had ap­proved his rid­ing li­cence for the 2021 sea­son, which starts to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>It was crush­ing news for his fans, but it was quashed when the man said that he was aim­ing for the fifth ti­tle with his new one-year li­cence.</p>
    <p>As much as that fourth con­sec­u­tive Sin­ga­pore cham­pion jockey ti­tle was, by his own ad­mis­sion the hard­est to en­gi­neer, Duric said he was al­ready look­ing to win a fifth ti­tle.</p>
    <p>He ad­mit­ted it was not go­ing to be easy. But, then again, it was not im­pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“Win­ning four Sin­ga­pore ti­tles is some­thing I’m re­ally proud of,” he said ear­lier in the week. “I’m look­ing for­ward to mak­ing it five in a row next year.”</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian jockey cer­tainly had to work hard for the honours.</p>
    <p>Brazil­ian Ruan Maia was not his only nemesis. He had to fight to keep his weight down. And it is a fight he will carry into the new year.</p>
    <p>Last sea­son, Maia proved to be a thorn in Duric’s side.</p>
    <p>He just would not go away – which made the bat­tle for the jockey’s ti­tle so ex­cit­ing.</p>
    <p>Along the way, Maia punched home some great numbers – like that seven-bag­ger on Aug 23 and a slew of four-bag­gers and hat­tricks. It got bit­ingly close.</p>
    <p>But, against a dis­mal Covid-19 back­drop, Duric dug in and, when all was done, he tal­lied 65 win­ners – three more than Maia. The fight went un­til the fi­nal day.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously, it’s been a dif­fi­cult year for ev­ery­body with Covid-19,” he said. “It’s been a stop-and-start sea­son, where at one stage, we didn’t even know if we would carry on,” he said.</p>
    <p>“But the Sin­ga­pore Turf Club and ev­ery­body in the in­dus­try stuck it out, and it’s been a won­der­ful team ef­fort. Per­son­ally, other than the fourth ti­tle, the other high­lights were my four Group 1s out of seven.”</p>
    <p>He scored two each with Top Knight (Sin­ga­pore Derby and Queen El­iz­a­beth II Cup) and In­ferno (Sin­ga­pore Guineas and Lion City Cup).</p>
    <p>Rides are the lifeblood of any jockey, but hav­ing spent eight years (he had a first three-year stint from 2009 to 2011) in Sin­ga­pore, Duric said the one main pil­lar that has kept him and the in­dus­try go­ing through hell and high wa­ter was the Club.</p>
    <p>“The Club has been go­ing through dif­fi­cult times, but it’s done a great job,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I, for one, am grate­ful they have given me a li­cence for next year. I’m look­ing for­ward to the new sea­son.”</p>
    <p>So, too, the Vlad Duric fan club.</p>
