    <p>To se­cure work passes for its for­eign em­ploy­ees, a com­pany i nflated their monthly salaries in its ap­pli­ca­tions to the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM). This was to ful­fil the min­i­mum salary re­quire­ments for the work passes to be granted.</p>
    <p>The firm, 7Star Restau­rant, was fined $52,000 yes­ter­day after plead­ing guilty to four charges re­lat­ing to falsely declar­ing the salaries of four em­ploy­ees to MOM. Eight other charges, in­volv­ing the salaries of other em­ploy­ees, were con­sid­ered dur­ing sen­tenc­ing by Dis­trict Judge Adam Nakhoda.</p>
    <p>At the time of the of­fences, which took place be­tween 2013 and 2017, the firm op­er­ated a restau­rant named 7Star Restau­rant In­dian/Malay Food in Up­per Seran­goon Road. The Straits Times un­der­stands the restau­rant has closed.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments, the firm over­stated the salaries of two work­ers when ap­ply­ing for their S Passes. It did so for one em­ployee in June 2013 and for an­other in Fe­bru­ary 2017. 7Star Restau­rant de­clared they were earn­ing $3,000 and $3,150 a month re­spec­tively, when they were in fact get­ting less than half that amount. Mid-level skilled work­ers are el­i­gi­ble for an S Pass, if they meet cer­tain re­quire­ments such as a fixed monthly salary of at least $2,400 a month.</p>
    <p>The firm also in­flated the monthly salaries of two other em­ploy­ees in its ap­pli­ca­tions, in Septem­ber 2014 and March 2015 re­spec­tively, to re­new their work passes. It had stated that one worker, an S Pass holder, was earn­ing $2,900 while the other worker, who was hold­ing an Em­ploy­ment Pass, had a salary of $4,500. In­stead, both were earn­ing $1,400 a month each.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ment Pass hold­ers who are young grad­u­ates must earn at least $3,900 a month, among other things. Older and more ex­pe­ri­enced work­ers must ful­fil a higher min­i­mum salary re­quire­ment.</p>
    <p>MOM pros­e­cu­tor Er­diana Ha­zlina said yes­ter­day that the com­pany never had the in­ten­tion to pay its work­ers the de­clared salaries.</p>
    <p>Its di­rec­tor, Mr Subra­ma­nian Thirup­pathi Raj, also knew that the min­i­mum salary re­quire­ment was a “key cri­te­rion” in grant­ing the work passes, she added.</p>
    <p>While he paid them through cheques re­flect­ing the false salaries ev­ery month, the work­ers had to re­turn the difference be­tween the false amounts and their ac­tual salaries in cash to him. Mr Raj also told them to sign on salary vouch­ers re­flect­ing the false salaries.</p>
    <p>The firm was or­dered to pay $13,000 up­front, with the rest of the fine to be paid in in­stal­ments over three months. For each of its of­fences, it could have been fined up to $20,000.</p>
