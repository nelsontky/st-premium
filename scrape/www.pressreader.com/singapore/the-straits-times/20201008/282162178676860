    <p>It is grat­i­fy­ing to note that</p>
    <p>Mr Amos Wu Pom Hin has ar­gued for a good Sa­mar­i­tan law (Need for com­pre­hen­sive law to pro­tect good Sa­mar­i­tans, Oct 6). Gen­er­ally speak­ing, there is legally no duty to res­cue an­other per­son who is placed in a dan­ger­ous sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The three key el­e­ments that sup­port a suc­cess­ful in­vo­ca­tion of the good Sa­mar­i­tan doc­trine are: a) the care ren­dered was per­formed as a re­sult of the emer­gency, b) the ini­tial emer­gency or in­jury was not caused by the per­son in­vok­ing the de­fence and c) the emer­gency care was not given in a grossly neg­li­gent or reck­less man­ner.</p>
    <p>A good Sa­mar­i­tan is a per­son who vol­un­tar­ily ren­ders aid in an emer­gency to an in­jured per­son and owes the stranger a duty of be­ing rea­son­ably care­ful.</p>
    <p>Neg­li­gence would ex­ist where it could be shown that the good Sa­mar­i­tan knew or should have known that his in­ter­ven­tion would in­jure the per­son he was try­ing to help.</p>
    <p>The idea of a good Sa­mar­i­tan law is that in some cases, peo­ple may think twice about as­sist­ing oth­ers if faced with the po­ten­tial threat of a law­suit.</p>
    <p>Some coun­tries have good Sa­mar­i­tan laws while oth­ers have a “duty to res­cue” re­quire­ment, which re­quires a per­son near a harm­ful sit­u­a­tion to step in and help or call the proper au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Duty to res­cue laws can be found in Ger­many, Is­rael and in some states of the United States.</p>
    <p>In this case, a res­cuer is favoured in the eyes of the law. Judges will make ev­ery ef­fort to pro­tect him so long as he is not grossly neg­li­gent. Heng Cho Choon</p>
