    <p>“Oh, just, sub­tle, and mighty opium!” ex­claimed the 19th-cen­tury es­say­ist Thomas De Quincey in his clas­sic ad­dic­tion mem­oir Con­fes­sions Of An English Opium-Eater. “What an up­heav­ing from its low­est depths, of the in­ner spirit!” he en­thused on its ef­fect, adding: “Here was the se­cret of hap­pi­ness, about which philoso­phers had dis­puted for many ages.”</p>
    <p>De Quincey had a child­hood that was trau­ma­tised by the death of his sis­ter, fol­lowed by his fa­ther dy­ing a year later. Through­out his life, he was af­flicted with de­pres­sion and at­tacks of fa­cial pain (a con­di­tion now known as trigem­i­nal neu­ral­gia) which drove him to an apothe­cary where he bought some opium. Not only did the pain dis­ap­pear af­ter he took it, he was trans­ported to what he called an “abyss of di­vine en­joy­ment”.</p>
    <p>The al­lur­ing and se­duc­tive ef­fects of opium have been known since an­tiq­uity. The Greek poet Homer called it a “won­drous sub­stance” and those who took it “did not shed a tear all day long, even if their mother or fa­ther had died, even if a brother or beloved son was killed be­fore their own eyes”.</p>
    <p>Opium, the dark, vis­cous resin from the pod of the poppy plant, has been used for cen­turies to ease the pain of phys­i­cal ail­ments, to tran­quil­lise grief and emo­tional tor­ments, or sim­ply to be “high” in that ar­ti­fi­cial par­adise.</p>
    <p>But once the habit takes hold, any ab­sti­nence makes the ad­dict feel – in the words of De Quincey – “the weight of in­cubus and night­mare”. Among the ag­o­nis­ing with­drawal symp­toms are stom­ach cramps, nau­sea, vom­it­ing, pro­fuse sweat­ing, and an in­vol­un­tary and con­stant ag­i­ta­tion of the legs, from which comes the term, “kick­ing the habit”.</p>
    <p>The at­tempt to re­fine opium into a pain re­liever with­out ad­dic­tive prop­er­ties pro­duced mor­phine, heroin, fen­tanyl, and an ar­ray of syn­thetic opi­oids – each ini­tially thought to be a phar­ma­co­log­i­cal won­der, but which would later add to the so­cial and public health night­mare of its pre­de­ces­sor.</p>
    <p>Oxy­codone – an­other syn­thetic opi­oid – led to the cur­rent deadly drug epi­demic in the United States where over­dose deaths ex­ceed those in the peak year of Aids, and from car ac­ci­dents or gun vi­o­lence, and it is the lead­ing cause of death for Amer­i­cans un­der 50.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a re­cent anal­y­sis by The Wall Street Jour­nal, the dis­rup­tions as­so­ci­ated with the Covid-19 pan­demic have wors­ened the opi­oid epi­demic, with over­dose deaths ratch­et­ing up­wards.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, ac­cord­ing to a 2020 Cen­tral Nar­cotics Bureau re­port, it is the older opi­oid, heroin, which is the most com­monly abused drug, fol­lowed by metham­phetamine – or Ice – and cannabis.</p>
    <p>All ad­dic­tions are char­ac­terised by en­slave­ment to the drug: The per­son’s wak­ing hours are spent pur­su­ing and us­ing it, re­cov­er­ing from its ef­fects, only to start all over again and again.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can Psy­chi­atric As­so­ci­a­tion, in its lat­est DSM-5 (a hand­book of clas­si­fi­ca­tion of men­tal dis­or­ders), has a cat­e­gory of “sub­stance-re­lated and ad­dic­tive dis­or­ders” char­ac­terised by a per­sis­tent and re­peated pat­tern of use, with harm­ful con­se­quences such as in­abil­ity to ful­fil ma­jor re­spon­si­bil­i­ties at work and per­sis­tent so­cial prob­lems at home and in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Drug abusers and ad­dicts are stig­ma­tised as lack­ing in willpower and moral fi­bre and by turns un­re­li­able, in­cor­ri­gi­ble, ma­nip­u­la­tive and crim­i­nal. And the re­sponse of most gov­ern­ments to­wards ad­dicts has been gen­er­ally puni­tive rather than salu­bri­ous – with tough anti-drug laws, in­clud­ing in­car­cer­at­ing them.</p>
    <p>A TREAT­ABLE CON­DI­TION</p>
    <p>But in the first decade of this cen­tury there was a change in the US, where Congress passed the Af­ford­able Care Act re­quir­ing in­sur­ance com­pa­nies to cover for ser­vices for sub­stance-use dis­or­ders, and it also al­lows chil­dren to re­main on their par­ents’ poli­cies un­til the age of 26.</p>
    <p>This shift in pol­icy was at­trib­uted in part to the find­ings of neu­ro­science re­search. Stud­ies showed that these psy­choac­tive sub­stances change the brain by dis­rupt­ing the mesolim­bic dopamine path­way – the en­doge­nous re­ward sys­tem in the brain – and al­ter­ing cer­tain cir­cuits such that an ad­dict has to have his “fix” just to feel “nor­mal”.</p>
    <p>The be­havioural ef­fects of these brain changes are man­i­fested by the over­whelm­ing urges and crav­ings when the per­son is ex­posed to cer­tain cues.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, the MediShield Life Coun­cil, which over­sees the ad­min­is­tra­tion of the ba­sic hospi­tal­i­sa­tion in­sur­ance scheme un­der the Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund Board, rec­om­mended ex­tend­ing the cov­er­age to pa­tients seek­ing treat­ment for drug and al­co­hol ad­dic­tion.</p>
    <p>Ad­vo­cates have long as­serted that drug ad­dic­tion should be re­garded like other dis­eases, such as hy­per­ten­sion or Type 2 di­a­betes, that come about through a com­plex in­ter­play of be­hav­iour, en­vi­ron­ment, ge­net­ics and phys­i­ol­ogy. And that is very much the po­si­tion that the MediShield Life Coun­cil has taken.</p>
    <p>In its con­sul­ta­tion pa­per, it states that ad­dic­tion is “a chronic med­i­cal dis­ease” that in­volves a myr­iad of fac­tors, and it could be as­sumed that pre­ven­tive and treat­ment ap­proaches would be as suc­cess­ful as that of other chronic dis­or­ders.</p>
    <p>IT’S NOT JUST DETOX­ING</p>
    <p>Ad­dic­tion treat­ments are com­plex, dif­fi­cult and fraught with re­ver­sals.</p>
    <p>Just help­ing an ad­dict to get over the symp­toms of with­drawal and rid the body of dregs of the drug through detox­i­fi­ca­tion is un­likely to pre­vent re­lapses. Long-term pro­grammes with drug test­ing over a pro­tracted pe­riod of time and train­ing and re­train­ing ad­dicts to avoid cues and sit­u­a­tions that will trig­ger a relapse are more ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>Such pro­grammes are ex­pen­sive and en­abling pa­tients to get in­sur­ance cov­er­age would go some way in help­ing them ac­cess treat­ment.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there is also con­ster­na­tion in some quar­ters over the rec­om­men­da­tion of the coun­cil. Some ne­ti­zens have ques­tioned the cov­er­age for some­thing that they see as a con­se­quence of “one’s bad choices”.</p>
    <p>While no one can be­come ad­dicted un­less he takes the drug in the first place, there is no sin­gle mo­ment when the per­son would choose to be­come af­flicted with this hellish prob­lem.</p>
    <p>The sim­plis­tic (and judg­men­tal) per­cep­tion that ad­dic­tion is a per­sonal choice, with the im­pli­ca­tion that it can be avoided sim­ply by the per­son show­ing more spine and “just say­ing no”, is dele­te­ri­ous as it fur­ther stig­ma­tises ad­dicts and de­nies them sym­pa­thy and the nec­es­sary sup­port and help.</p>
    <p>But ad­dic­tion is not sim­ply a clin­i­cal or a crim­i­nal prob­lem, or even a public health prob­lem. In so many in­stances, these sub­stances al­low that grat­i­fy­ing, al­beit treach­er­ous and tran­si­tory, es­cape from life’s tribu­la­tions and that se­duc­tive il­lu­sion­ary re­lease from phys­i­cal, psy­cho­log­i­cal, emo­tional and even ex­is­ten­tial pain.</p>
    <p>DEATHS OF DE­SPAIR</p>
    <p>In a 2015 pa­per in the Pro­ceed­ings of the Na­tional Academy of Sci­ences jour­nal, Prince­ton Univer­sity econ­o­mists Anne Case and An­gus Deaton first wrote about the rise in mor­tal­ity in the US that oc­curred par­tic­u­larly among work­ing-age white men and women with­out col­lege de­grees – and at a rate that was so high that for three con­sec­u­tive years, it dragged down the av­er­age life ex­pectancy for the en­tire pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The three main causes of death were drug and al­co­hol over­doses, sui­cide, and al­co­hol-as­so­ci­ated liver dis­ease – Dr Case and Dr Deaton called these “deaths of de­spair”.</p>
    <p>Ex­pli­cat­ing on these in their lat­est book Deaths Of De­spair And The Fu­ture Of Cap­i­tal­ism (pub­lished this year), they im­pli­cated the cu­mu­la­tive ef­fect of eco­nomic stag­na­tion and slow­down and the con­se­quent in­se­cu­rity, hard­ship and job­less­ness which hit those with­out a col­lege de­gree es­pe­cially hard.</p>
    <p>These men and women tended to have ten­u­ous jobs too poorly paid to sup­port a dig­ni­fied ex­is­tence, or had suf­fered loss of jobs.</p>
    <p>The jobs had pre­vi­ously given them a sense of self-worth and com­mu­nity, and los­ing them (to­gether with their em­ployer-pro­vided med­i­cal in­sur­ance), their sense of be­long­ing and se­cu­rity as well as self-es­teem took a nose­dive.</p>
    <p>Bat­tered by eco­nomic forces be­yond their con­trol, cut adrift from their so­cial moor­ing and with no prospect of a live­able fu­ture, they were an­gry and help­less. Many turned to drugs and al­co­hol to numb them­selves.</p>
    <p>But be­com­ing ad­dicted wors­ened that sense of hope­less­ness – and “in the wreck­age, the temp­ta­tions of al­co­hol and drugs lured many to their deaths”, wrote Dr Case and Dr Deaton.</p>
    <p>To keep peo­ple from that abyss of ad­dic­tion, and to help pull back those who have fallen over the precipice, we also need to ad­dress the sources of their de­spair.</p>
    <p>We will need more than laws that pros­e­cute those crim­i­nal pur­vey­ors of these toxic drugs.</p>
    <p>We will need to en­sure ba­sic things for those who are vul­ner­a­ble – de­cent ed­u­ca­tion, ac­cess to child­care and af­ford­able health­care, and rea­son­ably paid and steady em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>In other words, we need to give them what most of us want – a stake in a safe, dig­ni­fied and ful­fill­ing com­mu­nal life.</p>
    <p>While no one can be­come ad­dicted un­less he takes the drug in the first place, there is no sin­gle mo­ment when the per­son would choose to be­come af­flicted with this hellish prob­lem...</p>
    <p>Ad­dic­tion is not sim­ply a clin­i­cal or a crim­i­nal prob­lem, or even a public health prob­lem. In so many in­stances, these sub­stances al­low that grat­i­fy­ing, al­beit treach­er­ous and tran­si­tory, es­cape from life’s tribu­la­tions and that se­duc­tive il­lu­sion­ary re­lease from phys­i­cal, psy­cho­log­i­cal, emo­tional and even ex­is­ten­tial pain.</p>
