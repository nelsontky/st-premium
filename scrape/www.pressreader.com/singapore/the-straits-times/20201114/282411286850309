    <p>Three of the world’s top cen­tral bankers warned on Thurs­day that the prospect of a Covid-19 vac­cine is not enough to put an end to the eco­nomic chal­lenges cre­ated by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We do see the econ­omy con­tin­u­ing on a solid path of re­cov­ery, but the main risk we see to that is clearly the fur­ther spread of the dis­ease here in the United States,” Fed­eral Re­serve chair­man Jerome Pow­ell said in a panel dis­cus­sion at a vir­tual con­fer­ence hosted by the Euro­pean Cen­tral Bank (ECB).</p>
    <p>“With the virus now spread­ing, the next few months could be chal­leng­ing.”</p>
    <p>Mr Pow­ell was j oined on the panel by Bank of Eng­land (BOE) gov­er­nor An­drew Bai­ley and ECB pres­i­dent Chris­tine La­garde. Both echoed his cau­tion, and added to re­cent warn­ings from other cen­tral bankers against com­pla­cency.</p>
    <p>Mr Bai­ley called re­cent vac­cine news “en­cour­ag­ing” and said he hoped it would re­duce un­cer­tainty, but added that “we’re not there yet”. Ms La­garde said that while it is now be­com­ing pos­si­ble to see past the pan­demic, “I don’t want to be ex­u­ber­ant”.</p>
    <p>The words of warn­ing come as much of the US and Europe is en­veloped in a new wave of coro­n­avirus out­breaks. In the US, hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions are at record highs. In Europe and Bri­tain, gov­ern­ments have moved to re-im­pose lock­downs to limit the spread of the virus. World­wide, cases top 52.3 mil­lion and deaths ex­ceed 1.28 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Fed of­fi­cials next meet on Dec 15-16 and may tweak their bond­buy­ing pro­gramme in a bid to of­fer the econ­omy fur­ther sup­port, a pos­si­bil­ity Mr Pow­ell al­luded to fol­low­ing their pol­icy meet­ing last week. The BOE upped the size of its own bond-buy­ing pro­gramme last week and the ECB has al­ready flagged that it is also get­ting ready to add to mon­e­tary ac­com­mo­da­tion in the euro zone next month.</p>
    <p>FIS­CAL SUP­PORT</p>
    <p>US law­mak­ers are still de­bat­ing ad­di­tional fis­cal stim­u­lus fol­low­ing Demo­crat pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s vic­tory in last week’s election and a stronger-than-ex­pected show­ing by Se­nate Repub­li­cans, which may lead them to re­tain con­trol of that Cham­ber pend­ing the out­come of two Jan­uary run-off elec­tions in Ge­or­gia state.</p>
    <p>“My sense is that we will need to do more, and Congress may need to do more as well on fis­cal pol­icy,” Mr Pow­ell said.</p>
    <p>The cen­tral bank chiefs also sug­gested longer-term trends im­pact­ing the work­force have likely been ac­cel­er­ated by the pan­demic, with un­cer­tain ef­fects.</p>
    <p>“Even af­ter the un­em­ploy­ment rate goes down and there is a vac­cine, there is go­ing to be, prob­a­bly, a sub­stan­tial group of work­ers who are go­ing to need sup­port as they find their way in the post-pan­demic econ­omy, be­cause it is go­ing to be dif­fer­ent in some fun­da­men­tal ways,” Mr Pow­ell said.</p>
    <p>Ms La­garde sounded a slightly more op­ti­mistic note, cit­ing the rise of telemedici­ne and dig­i­tal pay­ments as pos­i­tive fea­tures of a more tech­nol­ogy-reliant world.</p>
    <p>“There will be trans­for­ma­tion that will be ben­e­fi­cial. There will be sec­tors of ser­vices that were not avail­able that can be now pro­vided from any­where to some­where,” she said. “It will ac­cel­er­ate dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion, which is an area where Europe was a lit­tle bit lag­ging be­hind, and where clearly much progress had to be made.”</p>
