    <p>Mizuho Fi­nan­cial Group is set to trim its Sin­ga­pore of­fice space, as the Ja­panese bank looks to re­vamp the work­place in global fi­nan­cial cen­tres in the wake of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s third-largest lender is look­ing to cut about 16 per cent of space, equiv­a­lent to less than one floor, at Asia Square Tower 2 in Shen­ton Way, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple with knowl­edge of the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Mizuho is an an­chor ten­ant in the build­ing owned by Cap­i­taLand Com­mer­cial Trust, oc­cu­py­ing four floors mea­sur­ing about 105,000 sq ft.</p>
    <p>The bank is also look­ing at how to make bet­ter use of its backup of­fice at Changi Busi­ness Park, the peo­ple added.</p>
    <p>Mizuho oc­cu­pies 200,000 sq ft there as part of its busi­ness con­ti­nu­ity plan.</p>
    <p>Banks around the world are grap­pling with how to utilise of­fices as they con­sider mak­ing flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments per­ma­nent once the pan­demic sub­sides. Mizuho has al­ready flagged plans to trim space in New York and Lon­don af­ter de­ter­min­ing that em­ploy­ees there re­mained pro­duc­tive while work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the Ja­panese bank joins Cit­i­group in par­ing its foot­print dur­ing the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Ama­zon.com is set to take over the space left by Cit­i­group, part of a trend of tech be­he­moths ex­pand­ing their pres­ence in the city-state as on­line shop­ping soars.</p>
    <p>Mizuho had al­ready been con­sid­er­ing an of­fice re­vamp in Sin­ga­pore but the plans were ex­ac­er­bated by the on­set of the virus and en­su­ing cir­cuit breaker, the peo­ple said.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules were re­laxed in June, only 35 per cent of its lo­cal staff re­turned to the of­fice.</p>
    <p>And even af­ter the au­thor­i­ties al­lowed more peo­ple to go back to work­places in Septem­ber, the bank did not rush to do so, rais­ing the fig­ure to about 40 per cent, the peo­ple said.</p>
    <p>While trim­ming of­fice space will re­duce costs, that was not the ob­jec­tive and it does not sig­nal that the bank its cut­ting man­power, they added. Mizuho spokesman Masako Shiono de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>Mizuho is also plan­ning to re­design its Sin­ga­pore of­fice, cre­at­ing a more open, com­mu­nal work­place to suit the needs of its younger work­force, the peo­ple said. But in the light of the pan­demic, safe man­age­ment mea­sures will be im­posed to avoid crowd­ing, they added.</p>
