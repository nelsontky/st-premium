    <p>Sing­tel has de­ployed Sin­ga­pore’s first 5G stand­alone trial net­work at its test­ing fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>The net­work of­fers en­ter­prises early ac­cess to 5G so they can de­velop and test ap­pli­ca­tions and pro­cesses, the telco said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It uses 3.5GHz spec­trum and tech­nol­ogy from Eric­s­son to de­liver ul­tra-fast speeds and low la­tency or re­sponse times.</p>
    <p>Sing­tel’s chief ex­ec­u­tive of group en­ter­prise Bill Chang said: “With 5G’s low la­tency and scal­a­bil­ity, en­ter­prises can not only drive ef­fi­cien­cies and make bet­ter and more cost-ef­fec­tive de­ci­sions, but also de­liver richer cus­tomer ex­pe­ri­ences.”</p>
    <p>En­ter­prises can reg­is­ter at Sing­tel’s web­site and test-bed ap­pli­ca­tions and tech­nolo­gies at the telco’s 5G Garage test­ing fa­cil­ity at no charge.</p>
    <p>Global cloud-gam­ing provider Ubi­tus has used Sing­tel’s 5G stand­alone net­work for a trial that con­sis­tently de­liv­ered an 85 per cent lower la­tency com­pared with on 4G.</p>
    <p>The Ubi­tus trial was con­ducted on a multi-ac­cess plat­form that in­te­grates 5G’s ul­tra-low la­tency and high-band­width ca­pa­bil­i­ties with power cloud com­put­ing per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>Sing­tel said this al­lows rich graph­ics to be pro­cessed and trans­ferred di­rectly to de­vices, sig­nif­i­cantly cut­ting lag time, which is crit­i­cal to the gam­ing ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>The new 5G tech­nol­ogy can be in­te­grated with the In­ter­net of Things, an­a­lyt­ics, ro­bot­ics, ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, as well as aug­mented, vir­tual or mixed re­al­ity.</p>
    <p>This en­ables en­ter­prises across industries to lever­age the low la­tency in ap­pli­ca­tions, re­quir­ing lit­tle or no lag time, Sing­tel said.</p>
    <p>This could mean re­mote surgery, smart man­u­fac­tur­ing, au­ton­o­mous driv­ing, re­mote ro­botic re­pair and main­te­nance, and vir­tual re­al­i­tyen­abled live con­certs.</p>
    <p>Last month, Sing­tel un­veiled its first 5G use case with its roundthe-clock, un­manned pop-up re­tail store named Now@Un­boxed.</p>
    <p>The stand­alone trial net­work also fol­lows Sing­tel’s re­cent launch of its 5G non-stand­alone net­work, which rides on ex­ist­ing 4G in­fras­truc­ture, to of­fer cus­tomers an early taste of 5G mo­bile speeds.</p>
    <p>Sing­tel said last month that it was on track to roll out its 5G net­work cov­er­age to half the is­land in two years, and na­tion­wide by 2025.</p>
    <p>Tel­cos M1 and StarHub plan to jointly roll out a stand­alone 5G net­work next year.</p>
    <p>The In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Author­ity has part­nered with mo­bile net­work op­er­a­tors to hire and reskill 1,000 pro­fes­sion­als to sup­port the 5G roll-out.</p>
    <p>StarHub chief of en­ter­prise business group Char­lie Chan said that the telco had part­nered Nanyang Polytech­nic in Jan­uary and Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore last De­cem­ber to es­tab­lish 5G test beds for en­ter­prises, fac­ulty and stu­dents.</p>
    <p>“We are now fa­cil­i­tat­ing the de­vel­op­ment of 5G use cases with mul­ti­ple en­ter­prise part­ners cov­er­ing ar­eas such as health­care, re­tail, ur­ban so­lu­tions and ad­vanced man­u­fac­tur­ing,” he said.</p>
