    <p>Through the course of Ms Farah Ma­lik’s ed­u­ca­tional jour­ney, even with­out her ask­ing, many have reached out to lend a hand.</p>
    <p>In sec­ondary school, a Viet­namese Asean scholar class­mate, who aced ad­di­tional math­e­mat­ics and chem­istry, tu­tored her be­tween and after classes when­ever she had dif­fi­cul­ties. A kind teacher gifted her with a copy of a chem­istry 10-year-se­ries when she did not want to bur­den her par­ents, whose jobs had been af­fected dur­ing the 2001 and 2008 re­ces­sions, with the cost.</p>
    <p>Ap­ply­ing for in­tern­ships as an un­der­grad­u­ate at the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Uni­ver­sity (SMU), she turned to men­tors such as Mem­ber of Par­lia­ment Na­dia Ah­mad Samdin, then part of the Lem­baga Bi­a­siswa Ke­nan­gan Maulud Youth Am­bas­sador Pro­gramme, who gave her tips on how to write ef­fec­tive e-mails and dress smartly for in­ter­views.</p>
    <p>All these ex­pe­ri­ences made the 25-year-old, who grad­u­ated from a two-year fast-track Mas­ter of Philosophy i n Psy­chol­ogy pro­gramme at SMU in June and is look­ing for a job, re­solve to give back as soon she could.</p>
    <p>In 2014, while do­ing a bach­e­lor of so­cial science in psy­chol­ogy and mar­ket­ing course at SMU, she and her brother, Mr Faris Ma­lik, 28, a dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing trainer, launched Sky High Ed­u­ca­tors.</p>
    <p>The so­cial en­ter­prise taps un­der­grad­u­ate tu­tors to help primary- to ter­tiary-level stu­dents ac­cess more affordable tu­ition. Prices range from $20 to $30 an hour depend­ing on their level – this is at least $10 to $20 cheaper than the mar­ket rate.</p>
    <p>Of late, the eco­nomic fall­out from the coron­avirus pan­demic has made it even more dif­fi­cult for un­der­priv­i­leged kids to get the help they need.</p>
    <p>Home-based learn­ing has also re­vealed a stark dig­i­tal di­vide. Some fam­i­lies do not have lap­tops or a steady In­ter­net con­nec­tion at home. Oth­ers, who are tight­en­ing their belts, have to pri­ori­tise buy­ing es­sen­tial i tems over pay­ing for tu­ition, says Ms Farah.</p>
    <p>Free on­line tu­ition was the sib­lings’ way of chip­ping in.</p>
    <p>Funded by a grant from a donor or­gan­i­sa­tion which prefers to re­main anony­mous, the so­cial en­ter­prise launched free on­line tu­ition for stu­dents with fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties last month. On top of paid ses­sions, they are of­fer­ing 10 free tu­ition ses­sions to at least 70 stu­dents, to help them through the end-of-year ex­am­i­na­tions.</p>
    <p>“We want to en­sure fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties will not pre­vent stu­dents from do­ing well aca­dem­i­cally be­cause we are firm be­liev­ers that ed­u­ca­tion is the most ef­fec­tive driver of so­cial mo­bil­ity,” she says.</p>
    <p>But be­yond tu­ition, which she ac­knowl­edges is only one as­pect of learn­ing, she hopes tu­tors will also serve as men­tors to these stu­dents.</p>
    <p>“We don’t like tu­ition, but we are realistic and know that the so­ci­ety we live in needs it. We en­cour­age our ed­u­ca­tors to of­fer advice on sub­ject com­bi­na­tions or ca­reer paths, or in­spire stu­dents to aim for goals which seem unattain­able,” she adds.</p>
    <p>Another non-profit youth or­gan­i­sa­tion, Ma­ju­lah Com­mu­nity, also be­lieves in the power of men­tor­ship. Since 2010, it has run var­i­ous pro­grammes to nur­ture lead­er­ship qual­i­ties i n youth, fo­cus­ing on those fac­ing aca­demic and personal chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>It iden­ti­fies youth at risk, helps boost their self-es­teem and of­fers them guid­ance through af­ter­school en­gage­ment ses­sions and outdoor ad­ven­ture ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Those with crim­i­nal records, anger man­age­ment is­sues or whose par­ents have filed fam­ily guid­ance or­ders – for­merly known as be­yond parental con­trol or­ders – also take part in a sep­a­rate pro­gramme called Gear Up. This fo­cuses on one-to-one men­tor­ship and outdoor ac­tiv­i­ties, in which men­tors nur­ture their pos­i­tive traits.</p>
    <p>In a game of dodge­ball, for in­stance, men­tors might point out how a stu­dent played fair by not at­tack­ing a team­mate when he was down.</p>
    <p>Mr Shafiee Razali, 32, the or­gan­i­sa­tion’s chief ex­ec­u­tive, says: “Ninety per cent of the stu­dents might not even know they have these strengths be­cause all their lives, they have been bom­barded by par­ents and teach­ers with all the neg­a­tive things they do.</p>
    <p>“We want to be that al­ter­na­tive adult fig­ure they can feel safe with and open up to with­out be­ing judged.”</p>
    <p>In the past few months, he says, it be­came even more im­por­tant to keep at-risk youth en­gaged so they would com­ply with cir­cuit breaker mea­sures and stay home.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the or­gan­i­sa­tion’s main</p>
    <p>Youth men­tor­ship is about plant­ing a seed and watch­ing it grow into a tree. You may say something to the stu­dents to­day and they dis­ap­pear to­mor­row, but they may come back to you years later and re­alise what you taught them makes sense.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>MR SHAFIEE RAZALI, chief ex­ec­u­tive of non-profit youth or­gan­i­sa­tion Ma­ju­lah Com­mu­nity</p>
    <p>so­cial me­dia ac­counts, staff cre­ated a pri­vate In­sta­gram ac­count to serve as a safe space for youth to com­mu­ni­cate. It fea­tured live chats with for­mer at-risk youth who are now in In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion col­leges and in a more sta­ble sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“The stu­dents shared things they would have done dif­fer­ently in the past, such as try­ing to man­age their anger or do bet­ter in school. When we in­ter­acted with them before, some were ag­gres­sive and would spew vul­gar­i­ties, but now, they have ma­tured,” Mr Shafiee says.</p>
    <p>On Ma­ju­lah Com­mu­nity’s pub­lic In­sta­gram ac­count, he also chats with change­mak­ers such as Mr Chan­dra Sheka­har, 22, a mentee­turned-vol­un­teer who used to visit an after-school drop-in centre that the or­gan­i­sa­tion runs.</p>
    <p>Now a full-time na­tional ser­vice­man, he shared his ex­pe­ri­ences in com­pet­i­tive e-sports tour­na­ments, how he in­tends to mon­e­tise his pas­sion, as well as tips for oth­ers hop­ing to em­bark on a sim­i­lar jour­ney.</p>
    <p>These are the heart­en­ing suc­cess sto­ries, the ones who emerged stronger from ad­ver­sity, says Mr Shafiee. There are many oth­ers who al­ter­nate be­tween im­prove­ment and re­gres­sion.</p>
    <p>As a men­tor, he ad­mits that the jour­ney can be tir­ing and men­tally drain­ing, but he is in it for the long haul.</p>
    <p>He says: “Youth men­tor­ship is about plant­ing a seed and watch­ing it grow into a tree. You may say something to the stu­dents to­day and they dis­ap­pear to­mor­row, but they may come back to you years later and re­alise what you taught them makes sense.”</p>
