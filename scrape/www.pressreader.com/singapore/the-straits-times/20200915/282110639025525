    <p>The case of for­mer domestic worker Parti Liyani, who was ac­quit­ted of steal­ing, thanks to the work of a lawyer who took on her case pro bono, high­lights the crit­i­cal role of pro bono lawyers in pro­tect­ing the less priv­i­leged in so­ci­ety and in up­hold­ing the rule of law in our coun­try.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties should re­view whether more can be done to sup­port pro bono lawyers and the valu­able ser­vice they pro­vide to so­ci­ety at large.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, vol­un­teer lawyers for crim­i­nal cases are as­signed by the Law So­ci­ety’s Pro Bono Ser­vices and paid an “hon­o­rar­ium” – an al­lowance – for the work they do.</p>
    <p>It is not clear if the al­lowance takes into ac­count the level of com­mit­ment that may be re­quired of a pro bono lawyer.</p>
    <p>In the case of Ms Parti, this trans­lated into at least 25 days of court hear­ings and about 500 pages of sub­mis­sions (for the trial and the ap­peal) by her lawyer Anil Balchan­dani. It would not be sur­pris­ing if he had to spend two to three months of his per­sonal and work time on this one case.</p>
    <p>As much as I would like to ap­plaud Mr Balchan­dani for his work, we should not ex­pect our lawyers (es­pe­cially not our top lit­i­ga­tors, who are in high de­mand) to work with­out proper re­mu­ner­a­tion over such an ex­tended pe­riod.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to re­view­ing the sup­port given to pro bono lawyers, we should also en­cour­age law firms and law schools to dis­close the num­ber of hours that they ded­i­cate to pro bono causes, as well as their notable achieve­ments in han­dling such cases.</p>
    <p>Like any other open mar­ket, the pro bono le­gal mar­ket can func­tion op­ti­mally only if healthy com­pe­ti­tion is fos­tered.</p>
    <p>In this sense, the case of Ms Parti should not be seen as the high wa­ter­mark for what pro bono lawyers can ac­com­plish. It should in­stead be the cat­a­lyst for greater ap­pre­ci­a­tion and de­vel­op­ment of pro bono le­gal ser­vices in Sin­ga­pore. Peter Heng Teck Wee</p>
