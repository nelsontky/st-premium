    <p>A song­bird poached to the brink of ex­tinc­tion has found a strong­hold in Sin­ga­pore, with likely more than half of its global wild pop­u­la­tion mak­ing their home here, a new study has found. Con­ser­va­tion ex­perts said the en­cour­ag­ing find­ing shows that con­ser­va­tion ef­forts in Sin­ga­pore are pay­ing off.</p>
    <p>Pub­lished on­line ear­lier this month, the re­search found that there are about 573 straw-headed bul­buls on main­land Sin­ga­pore and off­shore Pu­lau Ubin.</p>
    <p>These make up be­tween 22.9 per cent and 57.3 per cent of the global wild pop­u­la­tion, said the re­searchers in the pa­per pub­lished in the jour­nal Bird Con­ser­va­tion In­ter­na­tional.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers used the ex­ist­ing es­ti­mates for the global straw­headed bul­bul pop­u­la­tion – in the range of 1,000 to 2,499 – pub­lished by global con­ser­va­tion groups BirdLife In­ter­na­tional and the In­ter­na­tional Union for Con­ser­va­tion of Na­ture.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Frank Rheindt, who su­per­vised the study, said: “For Sin­ga­pore to be hold­ing a quar­ter to half of the wild world pop­u­la­tion is ex­tra­or­di­nary.”</p>
    <p>Threats faced by the species are mul­ti­fold, he said.</p>
    <p>De­for­esta­tion is of­ten the ini­tial driver of pop­u­la­tion dec­i­ma­tion for species like the straw-headed bul­bul, said Prof Rheindt, with habi­tat loss re­duc­ing their num­bers from the mil­lions to the thou­sands.</p>
    <p>“Once weak­ened, the species is driven to the brink of ex­tinc­tion by poach­ing. Poach­ing en­sures that no bird per­sists even in what lit­tle for­est re­mains,” he said.</p>
    <p>For poach­ers, the al­lure of the straw-headed bul­bul lies not in its golden straw-like plumage near its crown, but its song.</p>
    <p>Once com­monly found all across its range – which spans the re­gions of Bor­neo, In­done­sia’s Java and Sumatra, as well as the Thai-Malay Penin­sula – it is hardly found in the wild now. In fact, the bird is con­sid­ered ex­tir­pated – lo­cally ex­tinct – in places such as Thai­land and In­done­sia’s Java is­land.</p>
    <p>But ear­lier stud­ies had in­di­cated that the species might be doing com­par­a­tively bet­ter in Sin­ga­pore, said the study’s lead au­thor, Mr Chiok Wen Xuan, a wildlife re­searcher at the Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>“Species that are im­per­illed by both habi­tat loss and wildlife are par­tic­u­larly in­ter­est­ing to me, and I thought it would be of high con­ser­va­tion value, which is why I de­cided to em­bark on this re­search project,” he said.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, an up­dated pop­u­la­tion es­ti­mate of the species in Sin­ga­pore would be of great con­ser­va­tion im­por­tance, said Mr Chiok, as it pro­vides up­dated pop­u­la­tion num­bers for con­ser­va­tion plan­ning. “It also shows how the pro­tec­tion of Sin­ga­pore’s pop­u­la­tion is cru­cial in re­la­tion to its re­gional ex­tir­pa­tions,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Chiok said the 573 fig­ure may well be an un­der­es­ti­mate, as his sur­veys had ex­cluded mil­i­tary ar­eas like the forests in the western catch­ment.</p>
    <p>His pa­per fol­lows an ear­lier study on the straw-headed bul­bul pop­u­la­tion in Sin­ga­pore led by con­ser­va­tion scientist Yong Ding Li of BirdLife In­ter­na­tional.</p>
    <p>In 2017, the re­searchers had es­ti­mated its pop­u­la­tion here to be around 202. Dr Yong said the lat­est study showed the con­ser­va­tion ef­forts in Sin­ga­pore are pay­ing off.</p>
    <p>“Over time, we do ex­pect the pop­u­la­tion of the birds to in­crease, so the lat­est num­bers are en­cour­ag­ing,” he said, adding that the find</p>
    <p>ings were timely for a straw­headed bul­bul con­ser­va­tion plan be­ing for­mu­lated by the Na­ture So­ci­ety (Sin­ga­pore).</p>
    <p>Dr Adrian Loo, group di­rec­tor for wildlife man­age­ment at the Na­tional Parks Board (NParks), said there have been no cases of con­fis­ca­tion or seizure of straw-headed bul­buls in the last three years.</p>
    <p>The agency takes a zero-toler</p>
    <p>ance stance on keep­ing of wildlife, and the il­le­gal sale and trade of wildlife and their parts and de­riv­a­tives, he added.</p>
    <p>The straw-headed bul­bul has also been iden­ti­fied for species re­cov­ery ef­forts. Dr Loo said NParks is cur­rently con­duct­ing a two-year sur­vey of its pop­u­la­tion to get a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of their abun­dance and dis­tri­bu­tion lo­cally.</p>
    <p>He added that ef­forts to make Sin­ga­pore a City in Na­ture has also helped the straw-headed bul­buls to thrive here. “The es­tab­lish­ment of na­ture park net­works en­hances Sin­ga­pore’s nat­u­ral cap­i­tal as they safe­guard and ex­tend pro­tec­tion for core habi­tats of bio­di­ver­sity,” he said.</p>
