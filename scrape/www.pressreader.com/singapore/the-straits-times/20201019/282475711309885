    <p>On May 31, the most com­monly used words on English-lan­guage Twit­ter in­cluded “ter­ror­ist”, “vi­o­lence” and “racist”. This was about a week af­ter black Amer­i­can Ge­orge Floyd was killed, near the start of the protests that would last all sum­mer. Since the be­gin­ning of the pan­demic, the He­donome­ter’s sad­ness read­ings have set mul­ti­ple records.</p>
    <p>Which was the sad­dest day of them all? This is the ques­tion you may be ask­ing your­self, sur­vey­ing the wreck­age of 2020 thus far.</p>
    <p>There are so many con­tenders: Was it March 12, the day af­ter Tom Hanks an­nounced he was sick and the NBA (Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion) an­nounced it was can­celled? Was it June 1, the day peace­ful protesters were tear-gassed so that United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump could com­fort­ably stroll to his Bi­ble-wield­ing photo op?</p>
    <p>Ac­tu­ally, it was nei­ther, ac­cord­ing to the Com­pu­ta­tional Story Lab of the Univer­sity of Ver­mont. In­stead, its an­swer is May 31.</p>
    <p>That was not only the sad­dest day of 2020 so far, but it was also the sad­dest day recorded by the lab in the last 13 years. Or at least, the sad­dest day on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers call it the He­donome­ter. It is the in­ven­tion of lab co-di­rec­tors Chris Dan­forth and Peter Dodds, both math­e­ma­ti­cians and com­puter sci­en­tists.</p>
    <p>The He­donome­ter has been run­ning for more than a decade, mea­sur­ing word choices across mil­lions of tweets, ev­ery day, to come up with a mea­sure of well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>In fact, the last time The New York Times checked in with the He­donome­ter team in 2015, the main find­ing was the ten­dency to­wards re­lent­less pos­i­tiv­ity on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>“One of the hap­pi­est years on Twit­ter, at least for English,” Pro­fes­sor Dan­forth said. “Since then it has been a long de­cline.”</p>
    <p>What has re­mained con­stant is this: “Hap­pi­ness is hard to know. It’s hard to mea­sure,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Lab is part of a small but grow­ing field of re­searchers who try to parse the na­tional men­tal health through the prism of on­line life.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, never be­fore have we had such an in­cred­i­ble stock­pile of real-time data to choose from. And never has that stock­pile tow­ered as high as it does now: In the first months of the pan­demic, Twit­ter re­ported a 34 per cent in­crease in daily av­er­age user growth. With­out nor­mal so­cial life as an­ti­dote and an­chor, so­cial me­dia now feels more like real life than ever be­fore.</p>
    <p>Since 2008, the He­donome­ter has gath­ered a ran­dom 10 per cent of all pub­lic tweets, ev­ery day, across a dozen lan­guages. The tool then looks for words that have been ranked for their happy or sad con­no­ta­tion, counts them and cal­cu­lates a kind of na­tional hap­pi­ness av­er­age based on which words are dom­i­nat­ing the dis­course.</p>
    <p>On May 31, the most com­monly used words on English-lan­guage Twit­ter in­cluded “ter­ror­ist”, “vi­o­lence” and “racist”. This was about a week af­ter black Amer­i­can Ge­orge Floyd was killed, near the start of the protests that would last all sum­mer. Since the be­gin­ning of the pan­demic, the He­donome­ter’s sad­ness read­ings have set mul­ti­ple records.</p>
    <p>This year, “there was a full month of days that the He­donome­ter was read­ing sad­der than the Bos­ton Marathon day,” Prof Dan­forth said. “Our col­lec­tive at­ten­tion is very ephemeral. So it was re­ally re­mark­able that the in­stru­ment, for the first time, showed this sus­tained, de­pressed mood, and it got even worse, when the protests started.”</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor James Pen­nebaker, founder of on­line lan­guage anal­y­sis and a so­cial psy­chol­o­gist at the Univer­sity of Texas at Austin, be­came in­ter­ested in what the choice of words re­veals about our moods and char­ac­ters – ex­actly at the mo­ment when the In­ter­net was first sup­ply­ing such an enor­mous stock­pile of text to draw from and con­sider.</p>
    <p>“These dig­i­tal traces are mark­ers that we’re not aware of, but they leave marks that tell us the de­gree to which you are avoid­ing things, the de­gree to which you are con­nected to peo­ple,” said Prof Pen­nebaker, au­thor of The Se­cret Life Of Pro­nouns, among oth­ers. “They are telling us how you are pay­ing at­ten­tion to the world.”</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Mun­mun De Choud­hury, from the School of In­ter­ac­tive Com­put­ing at Ge­or­gia Tech, is also ex­am­in­ing dig­i­tal data for in­sights into well-be­ing. In 2013, she and her col­leagues found that by look­ing at new moth­ers on so­cial me­dia, they could help pre­dict which ones might de­velop post­par­tum de­pres­sion, based on their posts be­fore the ba­bies’ births.</p>
    <p>One of the most telling signs?</p>
    <p>The use of first-per­son sin­gu­lar pro­nouns, like “I” and “me”.</p>
    <p>“If I’m con­stantly talk­ing about ‘me’, it means my at­ten­tion has in­ward fo­cus,” she said. “In the con­text of other mark­ers, it can be a cor­re­late of men­tal ill­ness.”</p>
    <p>This find­ing first emerged in the work of Prof Pen­nebaker.</p>
    <p>You may be won­der­ing if Twit­ter is re­ally a rep­re­sen­ta­tive place to check the state of the pop­u­la­tion’s men­tal health. Af­ter all, many users tend to re­fer to it by nick­names such as “hell­site” and “sewer”.</p>
    <p>Some stud­ies have shown that fre­quent so­cial me­dia use is cor­re­lated with de­pres­sion and anx­i­ety. Can we re­ally dis­cern na­tional hap­pi­ness based on this par­tic­u­lar dig­i­tal en­vi­ron­ment and the frac­tion of the pop­u­la­tion – one in five last year – that reg­u­larly use Twit­ter?</p>
    <p>Dr An­gela Xiao Wu, an as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor of me­dia, cul­ture and com­mu­ni­ca­tion at New York Univer­sity, thinks we can­not.</p>
    <p>She ar­gues that in the rush to em­brace data, many re­searchers ig­nore the dis­tort­ing ef­fects of the plat­forms them­selves. We know Twit­ter’s al­go­rithms are de­signed to keep us hooked on our time­lines, emo­tion­ally in­vested in the con­tent and coaxed to­wards re­main­ing in a cer­tain men­tal state.</p>
    <p>“If so­cial sci­en­tists then take your re­sult­ing state, af­ter all these in­ter­ven­tions that these plat­forms have worked on you, and de­rive from that a na­tional mood? There’s a huge part of plat­form in­cite­ment that’s em­bed­ded in the data, but is not be­ing iden­ti­fied,” she said.</p>
    <p>In­deed, Dr Jo­hannes Eich­staedt, a com­pu­ta­tional so­cial sci­en­tist at Stan­ford and a founder of the World Well-Be­ing Pro­ject, con­cedes that the meth­ods like the ones his own lab uses are far from per­fect.</p>
    <p>“I would say it’s about a C+,” he said. “It’s not that ac­cu­rate, but it’s bet­ter than noth­ing.”</p>
