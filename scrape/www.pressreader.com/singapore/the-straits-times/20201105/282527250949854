    <p>There will be no giant-killing acts from Paul Lim and Harith Lim in this year’s World Cup of Darts, as the Sin­ga­porean duo with­drew days be­fore the start of the Nov 6-8 event.</p>
    <p>Harith, who had made plans to fly to host coun­try Austria on Tues­day, told The Straits Times: “With all the un­for­tu­nate things that have hap­pened, health and safety are our main con­cerns and rea­sons for this de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>“We are sad not to be able to par­tic­i­pate, but we hope to be back next year.”</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, Austria re­ported more than 5,600 new coro­n­avirus cases, forc­ing the gov­ern­ment to reim­pose par­tial lock­down mea­sures from Tues­day to Nov 30.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, a ter­ror at­tack left four dead and 22 wounded in Vi­enna, a three-hour drive from the tour­na­ment venue Salzbur­garena.</p>
    <p>While the Pro­fes­sional Darts Cor­po­ra­tion (PDC) did not re­spond to ST’s queries, it is un­der­stood the com­pe­ti­tion will still pro­ceed but as a closed-door event.</p>
    <p>The tour­na­ment, orig­i­nally sched­uled for June 18-21 at the Bar­clay­card Arena in Ham­burg, Ger­many, was first moved to the Prem­stat­tner Halle in Graz be­fore it was re­lo­cated to its cur­rent lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Por­tu­gal will re­place Sin­ga­pore and fea­ture in the event for the first time.</p>
    <p>Paul, 66, is a Hong Kong-based con­sul­tant and also had tick­ets to fly on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>He said: “It is dis­ap­point­ing we can­not go and play, be­cause we have done well in re­cent years, and we were look­ing for­ward to cre­at­ing more up­sets.</p>
    <p>“But I’m also not young any more, and I was a bit wor­ried about the virus to be­gin with. So, I guess it is bet­ter to be safe than sorry.”</p>
    <p>He and Harith have com­peted at the an­nual tour­na­ment since 2014 and reg­u­larly beaten high­er­ranked op­po­nents.</p>
    <p>In 2017, the un­seeded pair stunned sec­ond seeds Scot­land 5-2 in the first round, be­fore over­com­ing Spain 2-1 to reach the quar­ter-fi­nals. There they lost 2-1 to Bel­gium but still earned £14,000 (S$24,800).</p>
    <p>Last year, they elim­i­nated third seeds Wales in the first round, be­fore los­ing to Ja­pan. They col­lected £8,000 for their ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Harith, 50, works for a prop­erty de­vel­oper. He said: “This event has al­ways brought the best out of us – we have of­ten done dam­age when we play against the best.</p>
    <p>“Per­haps we have a psy­cho­log­i­cal edge be­cause we don’t play on the PDC Pro Tour and have noth­ing to lose, while the pro players are un­der pres­sure to beat us. We al­ways feel we have a chance of beat­ing any­one, and it’s the same this year, so it’s a shame we won’t be there.”</p>
    <p>While nei­ther him nor Paul are play­ing full-time – they each have a job – the Covid-19 out­break has af­fected them fi­nan­cially.</p>
    <p>The PDC Asian Tour and soft-tip darts cir­cuit have been suspended for most of the year, leaving few op­por­tu­ni­ties to com­pete.</p>
    <p>Harith and Paul nor­mally par­tic­i­pate in 30 or more lo­cal and in­ter­na­tional com­pe­ti­tions an­nu­ally and can earn up to six fig­ures in prize money. They have played fewer than five events this year.</p>
    <p>Paul said: “The good thing about darts is we can prac­tise on our own at home.</p>
    <p>“As with any sport, prac­tice is key to suc­cess, but things like con­fi­dence and match tem­per­a­ment can be built only through com­pe­ti­tion.”</p>
    <p>The World Cup has seen other no­table with­drawals, in­clud­ing Scot­land’s de­fend­ing cham­pi­ons Gary An­der­son and Peter Wright, who lost to Sin­ga­pore in 2017.</p>
    <p>It is dis­ap­point­ing we can­not go and play, be­cause we have done well in re­cent years, and we were look­ing for­ward to cre­at­ing more up­sets.</p>
