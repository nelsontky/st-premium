    <p>NEW YORK • Many things will have to work out to end the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. Drug com­pa­nies will have to de­velop a safe and ef­fec­tive vac­cine. Bil­lions of peo­ple will have to con­sent to vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>But there are more pro­saic chal­lenges, too.</p>
    <p>Among them: Com­pa­nies may have to trans­port tiny glass vials thou­sands of kilo­me­tres while keep­ing them as cold as the South Pole in the depths of win­ter.</p>
    <p>A num­ber of the lead­ing Covid-19 vac­cines un­der de­vel­op­ment will need to be kept at tem­per­a­tures as low as mi­nus 80 deg C from the mo­ment they are bot­tled to the time they are ready to be in­jected into pa­tients’ arms.</p>
    <p>That will not be easy. Vac­cines may be man­u­fac­tured on one con­ti­nent and shipped to an­other. They will go from lo­gis­tics hub to lo­gis­tics hub be­fore end­ing up at the hospi­tals and other fa­cil­i­ties that will ad­min­is­ter them.</p>
    <p>While no vac­cine has yet been ap­proved by health of­fi­cials in the United States, prepa­ra­tions for a mass vac­ci­na­tion cam­paign are gear­ing up.</p>
    <p>The US mil­i­tary and a fed­eral con­trac­tor are ex­pected to play a role in co­or­di­nat­ing the dis­tri­bu­tion. But a hodge­podge of com­pa­nies are scram­bling to fig­ure out how to keep hun­dreds of mil­lions of doses of a vac­cine very, very cold.</p>
    <p>Planes, trucks and ware­houses will need to be out­fit­ted with freez­ers. Glass vials will need to with­stand i cy climes. Some­one will need to make a lot more dry ice.</p>
    <p>“We’re only now begin­ning to un­der­stand the com­plex­i­ties of the de­liv­ery side of all of this,” said Mr J. Stephen Mor­ri­son, se­nior vice-pres­i­dent at the Cen­tre for Strate­gic and In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies, a re­search firm.</p>
    <p>“And there’s no get­ting around it. Th­ese have stark tem­per­a­ture de­mands that will con­strain ac­cess and de­liv­ery.”</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump last Fri­day said hun­dreds of mil­lions of doses of an uniden­ti­fied vac­cine will be avail­able to all Amer­i­cans by next April. That time­line is more am­bi­tious than what his own ad­vis­ers have de­scribed.</p>
    <p>Dr Robert Red­field, di­rec­tor of the Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion (CDC), told a Se­nate com­mit­tee last Wed­nes­day that a vac­cine would not be widely avail­able un­til the mid­dle of next year.</p>
    <p>Of the three vac­cines that have ad­vanced to Phase III tri­als, two – one made by Moderna and the National In­sti­tutes of Health, the other by Pfizer and BioNTech – need to be kept in a near con­stant deep freeze.</p>
    <p>They are made with ge­netic ma­te­ri­als that fall apart when they thaw. An­other lead­ing vac­cine can­di­date, be­ing de­vel­oped by As­traZeneca and Ox­ford Uni­ver­sity, must be kept cool but not frozen.</p>
    <p>McKesson, a ma­jor drug dis­trib­u­tor, won a ma­jor fed­eral con­tract last month to help dis­trib­ute a coro­n­avirus vac­cine. Much of the work, how­ever, will fall to com­pa­nies out­side the med­i­cal and drug in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>MAS­SIVE-SCALE OP­ER­A­TION</p>
    <p>The ma­jor US lo­gis­tics com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing UPS and FedEx, al­ready have net­works of freez­ers that they use to ship per­ish­able food and med­i­cal sup­plies. The com­pa­nies have ex­pe­ri­ence ship­ping vac­cines for other ill­nesses, in­clud­ing the sea­sonal flu.</p>
    <p>But the Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion ef­fort is likely to dwarf all pre­vi­ous cam­paigns.</p>
    <p>UPS said it was con­struct­ing a so­called freezer farm in Louisville, Ken­tucky, the com­pany’s largest hub, where it can store mil­lions of doses at sub-zero tem­per­a­tures.</p>
    <p>At FedEx, the vac­cine prepa­ra­tions are be­ing led by Mr Richard W. Smith, the son of the com­pany’s</p>
    <p>founder Fred W. Smith.</p>
    <p>The younger Mr Smith, who runs the com­pany’s air­line op­er­a­tions in the Amer­i­cas, was in charge of the life sci­ences busi­ness for FedEx’s air­line op­er­a­tions in 2009, dur­ing the H1N1 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>At the time, the US gov­ern­ment asked FedEx to pre­pare to help trans­port vac­cines, Mr Smith said, and the com­pany dou­bled its num­ber of freez­ers around the globe.</p>
    <p>“For­tu­nately, H1N1 did not rise to the l evel of the pan­demic we thought it could be,” he said. “But that al­lowed us to re­ally beef up our cold-chain in­fra­struc­ture.”</p>
    <p>As if the chal­lenge were not suf­fi­ciently daunt­ing, the world is fac­ing a loom­ing short­age of dry ice – an un­ex­pected side ef­fect of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Dry ice, the stuff that ex­udes chilly smoke and en­thrals schoolage sci­en­tists, is made from car­bon diox­ide, which is most com­monly cre­ated as a byprod­uct dur­ing the pro­duc­tion of ethanol.</p>
    <p>But ethanol pro­duc­tion ebbs and flows based on the de­mand for gaso­line. This spring, as stay-at-home or­ders went into ef­fect, peo­ple be­gan driv­ing less. As a re­sult, ethanol pro­duc­tion slumped, and so did the sup</p>
    <p>ply of car­bon diox­ide.</p>
    <p>FIRMS FIND OWN SO­LU­TIONS</p>
    <p>UPS and FedEx are tak­ing mat­ters into their own hands. FedEx al­ready has ma­chines in ware­houses that can pro­duce dry ice, and UPS said it was con­sid­er­ing adding them.</p>
    <p>The com­pa­nies will also have to pro­vide their de­liv­ery em­ploy­ees with spe­cial train­ing and equip­ment such as gloves to han­dle their icy wares.</p>
    <p>Pfizer has de­signed a spe­cial box to trans­port its hoped-for vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The boxes, roughly the size of a large cooler, will hold a cou­ple of hun­dred glass vials, each con­tain­ing 10 to 20 doses of vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The boxes are equipped with Global Po­si­tion­ing Sys­tem-en­abled ther­mal sen­sors, al­low­ing Pfizer to know where the boxes are and how cold they are.</p>
    <p>All of this leads to an­other prob­lem: Glass of­ten cracks in ex­treme cold.</p>
    <p>Early this year, Corn­ing, a 169-year-old glass­maker in up­state New York, ap­proached of­fi­cials at the Depart­ment of Health and Hu­man Ser­vices with a warn­ing: There would not be enough cold-re­sis­tant glass vials to han­dle a frozen vac­cine, said Mr Bren­dan Mosher, Corn­ing’s head of phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>Corn­ing pitched a so­lu­tion. It could make mil­lions of vials with a new type of phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal-grade glass that can with­stand the low­est tem­per­a­tures.</p>
    <p>In June, the gov­ern­ment awarded the com­pany a US$204 mil­lion (S$277 mil­lion) con­tract to in­crease its pro­duc­tion of the spe­cial vials.</p>
    <p>The new glass is made with­out boron, a com­mon in­gre­di­ent in con­ven­tional glass that can lead to con­tam­i­na­tion of what­ever is in the vials.</p>
    <p>Mr Mosher said Corn­ing was us­ing the fed­eral money to quadru­ple the ca­pac­ity at its plant in Big Flats, New York; to ac­cel­er­ate con­struc­tion of a glass fur­nace in New Jersey; and to speed up con­struc­tion of an ad­di­tional plant in North Carolina. Corn­ing is hir­ing 300 work­ers and says it is on track to start pro­duc­ing hun­dreds of mil­lions of glass vials next year.</p>
    <p>AD­MIN­IS­TER­ING DOSES</p>
    <p>Even if there is enough dry ice and chilled ware­houses and sturdy vials, ev­ery­day pharmacies are un­likely to be equipped to stock­pile large quan­ti­ties of vac­cines that re­quire ul­tra­cold stor­age. Nev­er­the­less, they might be able to keep Pfizer’s cooler-size boxes on hand, and Moderna’s vac­cine can be stored at less ex­treme tem­per­a­tures in the days be­fore it is ad­min­is­tered.</p>
    <p>In a pre­sen­ta­tion to the White House coro­n­avirus task force last month, Dr Kath­leen Dool­ing, a dis­ease ex­pert with the CDC, said strict tem­per­a­ture re­quire­ments “will make it very dif­fi­cult for community clin­ics and lo­cal pharmacies to store and ad­min­is­ter”.</p>
    <p>She said the vac­cine would have to be dis­pensed “at cen­tralised sites with ad­e­quate equip­ment and high through­put”. It is not clear where those sites will be or who will ad­min­is­ter the vac­cines.</p>
    <p>That is just in the US.</p>
    <p>A vac­cine re­quir­ing strin­gent tem­per­a­ture con­trols would be off lim­its for much of the de­vel­op­ing world. A re­cent study by DHL and McKin­sey found that a cold vac­cine would be ac­ces­si­ble to about 2.5 bil­lion peo­ple in 25 coun­tries. Large parts of Africa, South Amer­ica and Asia, where su­per­cold freez­ers are sparse, would be left out.</p>
    <p>Mr Mor­ri­son, from the Cen­tre for Strate­gic and In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies, said: “The con­se­quence is to re­in­force the stag­ger­ing bias in favour of the wealthy and pow­er­ful few coun­tries.”</p>
