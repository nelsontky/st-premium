    <p>Em­ploy­ees who made claims for owed salaries or wrong­ful dis­missal be­tween April last year and March this year man­aged to re­cover about $16 million in all from their em­ploy­ers. About 91 per cent of the 6,537 em­ploy­ees who made claims had their cases fully re­solved at the Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Dis­pute Man­age­ment and the Employment Claims Tri­bunals.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ees who made claims for owed salaries or wrong­ful dis­missal be­tween April 2019 and March this year man­aged to re­cover about $16 million in all from their em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>About 91 per cent of the 6,537 em­ploy­ees who made claims had their cases fully re­solved at the Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Dis­pute Man­age­ment (TADM) and the Employment Claims Tri­bunals. They re­ceived the full sums of salaries owed or com­pen­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>This was re­vealed by the Tri­par­tite Al­liance Lim­ited (TAL) yes­ter­day in its an­nual re­port for the year ended March 31 this year.</p>
    <p>In the fi­nan­cial year that ended on March 31 last year, TADM re­cov­ered around $15 million in salaries owed to em­ploy­ees in Sin­ga­pore, with about 90 per cent of em­ploy­ees who filed claims fully re­cov­er­ing their salaries.</p>
    <p>TAL was set up by the Min­istry of Man­power, Na­tional Trades Union Congress and Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion in 2016.</p>
    <p>It over­sees TADM, the Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Fair and Pro­gres­sive Employment Prac­tices (Tafep), and the Work­place Safety and Health (WSH) Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>In April last year, the Employment Act and the Employment Claims Act were amended to al­low all em­ploy­ees – in­clud­ing those who earn more than $4,500 a month – to file claims against their em­ploy­ers for wrong­ful dis­missal. This ex­tended pro­tec­tion to more man­agers and ex­ec­u­tives against wrong­ful dis­missal.</p>
    <p>Work­ers who wish to make a wrong­ful dis­missal claim must first un­dergo me­di­a­tion with their em­ploy­ers at TADM. If this is un­suc­cess­ful, they will be re­ferred to the Employment Claims Tri­bunals.</p>
    <p>Since the changes, 1,958 em­ploy­ees had sought ad­vice from TADM on sus­pected wrong­ful dis­missal be­tween April last year and March this year, said TAL yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Of these, 831 em­ploy­ees were of­fered me­di­a­tion ser­vices, and most of them reached mu­tu­ally ac­cept­able so­lu­tions with their em­ploy­ers with­out hav­ing to es­ca­late the dis­pute for ad­ju­di­ca­tion at the Employment Claims Tri­bunals.</p>
    <p>Most of the dis­missal claims lodged in­volved rank-and-file em­ploy­ees who were dis­missed with­out no­tice, or who dis­puted the rea­sons for dis­missal. These cases were re­solved through me­di­a­tion with TADM’s help, said TAL.</p>
    <p>In cases where work­ers’ ser­vices were ter­mi­nated in ac­cor­dance with their employment con­tracts, TADM re­ferred them to the Employment Claims Tri­bunals for ad­ju­di­ca­tion with­out me­di­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, there was a 42 per cent in­crease in work­place dis­crim­i­na­tion or harassment com­plaints to Tafep, with one in four com­plaints re­lated to fair con­sid­er­a­tion for Sin­ga­pore­ans in hir­ing prac­tices.</p>
    <p>One in 10 com­plaints was re­lated to age dis­crim­i­na­tion and one in 13 com­plaints was re­lated to gen­der dis­crim­i­na­tion. TAL said the in­crease in com­plaints was due to the ex­panded scope of is­sues han­dled by Tafep, which in­cludes work­place harassment and un­fair con­trac­tual terms in­clud­ing liq­ui­dated dam­ages and re­straint of trade.</p>
    <p>“The en­hanced fair con­sid­er­a­tion frame­work which put up harsher penal­ties on em­ploy­ers for dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices also con­trib­uted to the in­crease,” the tri­par­tite al­liance added in its re­port.</p>
    <p>The WSH Coun­cil has also brought more com­pa­nies on board its work­place safety and health pro­grammes such as bizSAFE and cul­tureSAFE.</p>
    <p>TAL chair­man Stephen Lee said that as at May this year, about 90 of its em­ploy­ees have taken on var­i­ous roles to fight Covid-19, such as sup­port­ing the Min­istry of Man­power’s op­er­a­tions in for­eign</p>
    <p>worker dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>“Now, more than ever, the spirit of co­op­er­a­tion and part­ner­ship in tri­par­tism has proven to be in­valu­able. Em­ploy­ers, work­ers and the Gov­ern­ment need to work to­gether to save jobs, adapt to new ways of work­ing, and sup­port na­tional ef­forts to con­tain the spread of the virus and mit­i­gate its ef­fects,” he said in the re­port.</p>
