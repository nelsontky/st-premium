    <p>When Mr Ben Ng, 55, fell se­verely ill with Covid-19 in March, he spent 13 days in the in­ten­sive care unit (ICU).</p>
    <p>There, he ex­pe­ri­enced the ter­ror of ICU delir­ium, when he hal­lu­ci­nated con­tin­u­ously and lost track of night and day.</p>
    <p>Lit­tle did he re­alise that the men­tal toll of the har­row­ing ex­pe­ri­ence would con­tinue long af­ter he was de­clared free of the virus and dis­charged later that month.</p>
    <p>In the be­gin­ning, the flash­backs of his time in the ICU came thick and fast.</p>
    <p>“I could see my­self ly­ing in the ICU bed, and I re­mem­ber peo­ple ask­ing me ques­tions. It hap­pened through­out the day and ev­ery day. It was quite bad in the first two months,” he tells The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>Af­ter he was dis­charged, Mr Ng also ex­pe­ri­enced short­ness of breath, which he no­ticed when he went out to buy gro­ceries from the nearby su­per­mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“I found that when I walked a lit­tle faster or when I car­ried heavy stuff, I would start to pant,” he says.</p>
    <p>“I had to sit down and rest at the void deck. It’s like my lungs haven’t fully re­cov­ered.”</p>
    <p>Around the world, there are now more anec­do­tal re­ports of some Covid-19 pa­tients suf­fer­ing from lin­ger­ing symp­toms of the dis­ease, such as short­ness of breath and fa­tigue. Some also have prob­lems fo­cus­ing, and have headaches and dizzi­ness. Oth­ers have heart pal­pi­ta­tions and more.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng, who is sin­gle, re­turned to his work in sales in early April, but that in­volved work­ing from home, where he lives alone.</p>
    <p>There, he found him­self spend­ing most of his time in front of the com­puter in his room.</p>
    <p>“It re­minded me of my ICU room, so I kept see­ing my­self with the tube in­side,” says Mr Ng.</p>
    <p>When he felt over­whelmed, Mr Ng would step out of his room for a breather, but it was tough.</p>
    <p>“I told my boss I had this prob­lem, so she al­lowed me to take short breaks ev­ery one hour and a half.”</p>
    <p>There were days when he could not cope and his boss would let him take longer breaks of two to three hours.</p>
    <p>“I ac­tu­ally wanted to see a psy­chi­a­trist, but it was the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod. So I spoke to my fam­ily</p>
    <p>NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY</p>
    <p>I want to tell peo­ple not to take this lightly. It can hap­pen to any­one.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>MR BEN NG, who suf­fered lin­ger­ing symp­toms of Covid-19 like short­ness of breath even af­ter his dis­charge.</p>
    <p>What Covid-19 can do to the body</p>
    <p>about it as the pres­sure was too great. It helps as you let it out, and it got bet­ter for me,” says Mr Ng.</p>
    <p>He wanted a change of en­vi­ron­ment, but his re­quest to work in the of­fice was ini­tially turned down as his col­leagues were wor­ried about him hav­ing to travel to work.</p>
    <p>He re­turned to the of­fice to work last month.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts have said that those who had been very ill with Covid-19 are at risk of de­vel­op­ing psy­cho­log­i­cal prob­lems, in­clud­ing post-trau­matic stress dis­or­der, a psy­chi­atric dis­or­der that can oc­cur in peo­ple who have ex­pe­ri­enced a trau­matic event.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple are start­ing to no­tice that the dis­ease can some­times have lin­ger­ing ef­fects and some have formed sup­port groups on­line.</p>
    <p>Some are also reach­ing out to get help. In Bri­tain, a re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion cen­tre ded­i­cated to help­ing Covid-19 pa­tients re­cover from the long-term ef­fects of the dis­ease opened in late May.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 re­hab clin­ics have also sprung up else­where over­seas.</p>
    <p>HAL­LU­CI­NA­TIONS</p>
    <p>In late March, when Mr Ng shared his ICU ex­pe­ri­ence with The Straits Times for an ear­lier re­port, he had de­scribed hal­lu­ci­nat­ing about be­ing in var­i­ous sce­nar­ios while heav­ily se­dated.</p>
    <p>In one scene, he was star­ing at an empty of­fice, and in another, words in Korean, which he does not un­der­stand, kept flash­ing at him.</p>
    <p>Then there were alien crea­tures in the room. “You’re stuck in those scenes and you have no idea if it’s day or night or if you can ever get out of them,” he re­calls now.</p>
    <p>He still gets flash­backs, par­tic­u­larly when he reads news re­ports on Covid-19, but they are less fre­quent now.</p>
    <p>“I just try to keep my­self oc­cu­pied. I don’t get so emo­tional like I used to,” says Mr Ng.</p>
    <p>“Pre­vi­ously, I would feel the fear and think, ‘What if I didn’t wake up?’. You start to imag­ine it and it was quite neg­a­tive. Now, I can con­trol it bet­ter and not be­come gloomy.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ng is also man­ag­ing his phys­i­cal symp­toms bet­ter. “I can still feel the short­ness of breath but it doesn’t tire me out so eas­ily.”</p>
    <p>He saw the grad­ual im­prove­ment around early last month when he panted less dur­ing evening walks.</p>
    <p>“Pre­vi­ously, it took me an hour to fin­ish my cir­cuit walk. Now, I can fin­ish this in about 40 min­utes.”</p>
    <p>He had “pock­ets of mem­ory loss” on his dis­charge, but does not feel the brain “fog” now.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng, who is happy to share his ex­pe­ri­ence but prefers to keep a low pro­file for fear of the stigma at­tached to Covid-19, has de­vel­oped new habits.</p>
    <p>“The doc­tor I saw at the hos­pi­tal told me that I won’t get in­fected again, but I read that the Covid-19 virus may mu­tate,” he says.</p>
    <p>“So, you just clean, clean, clean. Ba­si­cally, that’s what I do ev­ery day.”</p>
    <p>Thank­ful to have sur­vived, he has also been mak­ing monthly de­liv­er­ies of egg tarts and other pas­tries to Alexandra Hos­pi­tal’s ICU team who had cared for him.</p>
    <p>It has been about four months since he was dis­charged, and he is fi­nally feel­ing more like his old self.</p>
    <p>His habits of dili­gent clean­ing and hand-wash­ing may stick for a long while. There is also the stress he needs to man­age, but he is feel­ing – and sound­ing – a lot more up­beat.</p>
    <p>“The hos­pi­tal doc­tor, af­ter she saw my lung X-rays, told me I am very for­tu­nate to be alive, as I also have un­der­ly­ing con­di­tions. So, this is like a sec­ond life and it’s not some­thing that ev­ery­body can have,” says Mr Ng, who has di­a­betes and high blood pres­sure.</p>
    <p>“I want to tell peo­ple not to take this lightly. It can hap­pen to any­one.”</p>
    <p>In late April, when Mr Ng took his tem­per­a­ture – a habit he started dur­ing this pan­demic – and found that it was slightly higher than the pre­vi­ous days, he pan­icked.</p>
    <p>He quickly threw a new set of cloth­ing, a dis­pos­able shaver, toi­letries, a book and his iPad into an overnight bag.</p>
    <p>“I thought I’ve to go back to the hos­pi­tal. But then every­thing went back to nor­mal at the end of the day.” His bag re­mains packed.</p>
