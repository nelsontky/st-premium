    <p>Af­ter all we’ve been through this year, wouldn’t it be nice, even dur­ing a dis­tanced hol­i­day sea­son, to be able to talk about this whole ex­pe­ri­ence with oth­ers in a deep, sat­is­fy­ing way?</p>
    <p>To help, I’ve put to­gether a list of non-ob­vi­ous lessons for how to have bet­ter con­ver­sa­tions, which I’ve learnt from peo­ple wiser than my­self:</p>
    <p>AP­PROACH WITH AWE</p>
    <p>C. S. Lewis once wrote that if you’d never met a hu­man and sud­denly en­coun­tered one, you’d be in­clined to wor­ship this crea­ture. Ev­ery hu­man is a mir­a­cle and is your su­pe­rior in some way.</p>
    <p>The peo­ple who have great con­ver­sa­tions walk into the room ex­pect­ing to be de­lighted by you and make you feel the beam of their af­fec­tion and re­spect.</p>
    <p>Lady Ran­dolph Churchill once said that when sit­ting next to states­man Wil­liam Glad­stone, she thought him the clever­est per­son in England, but when she sat next to Ben­jamin Dis­raeli, she thought she was the clever­est per­son in England.</p>
    <p>ASK EL­E­VAT­ING QUES­TIONS</p>
    <p>All of us have de­vel­oped a way of be­ing that is our tech­nique for get­ting through each day.</p>
    <p>But some ques­tions, star­tling as they seem at first, com­pel us to see our­selves from a higher van­tage: What cross­roads are you at? What com­mit­ments have you made that you no longer be­lieve in? Whom do you feel most grate­ful to have in your life? What prob­lem did you use to have but now have licked? In what ways are you slid­ing back­ward? What would you do if you weren’t afraid?</p>
    <p>ASK OPEN-ENDED QUES­TIONS</p>
    <p>Many of us have a hor­ri­ble ten­dency to ask ques­tions that im­ply judg­ment: Where did you go to school? Or we ask yes/no ques­tions: Did you have a good day?</p>
    <p>Which ba­si­cally shut off in­ter­est­ing an­swers. Bet­ter ques­tions start with, “What was it like...” or, “Tell me about a time...” or, “How did you man­age to cope while your wed­ding was post­poned for a year?”</p>
    <p>MAKE THEM AU­THORS, NOT WIT­NESSES</p>
    <p>The im­por­tant part of peo­ple’s lives is not what hap­pened to them but how they ex­pe­ri­enced what hap­pened to them. So many of the best con­ver­sa­tions are not just a recita­tion of events.</p>
    <p>They in­volve go­ing over and over an event, see­ing it from wider per­spec­tives coat­ing it with new lay­ers of emo­tion, trans­form­ing it, so that, say, an event that was very hard to live through is now very sat­is­fy­ing to re­mem­ber.</p>
    <p>TREAT AT­TEN­TION AS ALL OR NOTH­ING</p>
    <p>Of course, we all have di­vided at­ten­tion. In You’re Not Lis­ten­ing, au­thor Kate Mur­phy writes that in­tro­verts have more di­vided at­ten­tion than oth­ers while in con­ver­sa­tion be­cause there’s so much busy­ness go­ing on in their own heads. But in con­ver­sa­tion it’s best to act as if at­ten­tion had an on/off switch with no dim­mer. To­tal fo­cus.</p>
    <p>I have a friend who lis­tens to con­ver­sa­tions the way con­gre­gants lis­ten to ser­mons in charis­matic churches – with amens and ap­pro­ba­tions. The ef­fect is mag­netic.</p>
    <p>DON’T FEAR THE PAUSE</p>
    <p>Most of us stop lis­ten­ing to a com­ment about half­way through so we can be ready with a re­sponse. In Ja­pan, Ms Mur­phy writes, busi­ness­men are more likely to hear the whole com­ment and then pause, some­times eight sec­onds, be­fore re­spond­ing, which is twice as long a silence as Amer­i­can busi­ness­men con­ven­tion­ally tol­er­ate.</p>
    <p>KEEP THE GEM STATE­MENT FRONT AND CEN­TRE</p>
    <p>In the midst of many dif­fi­cult con­ver­sa­tions, there is what me­di­a­tor Adar Co­hen calls the gem state­ment. This is the com­ment that keeps the re­la­tion­ship to­gether: “Even when we can’t agree on Dad’s med­i­cal care, I’ve never doubted your good in­ten­tions. I know you want the best for him.”</p>
    <p>If you can both seize that gem state­ment, it may point to a so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>FIND THE DISAGREEME­NT UN­DER THE DISAGREEME­NT</p>
    <p>In the Tal­mu­dic tra­di­tion, when two peo­ple dis­agree about some­thing, it’s be­cause there is some deeper philo­soph­i­cal or moral disagreeme­nt un­der­gird­ing it. Con­ver­sa­tion then be­comes a shared process of try­ing to dig down to the un­der­ly­ing disagreeme­nt and then the un­der­ly­ing disagreeme­nt be­low that. There is no end.</p>
    <p>Con­flict cre­ates co­op­er­a­tive ef­fort. As neu­ro­sci­en­tist Lisa Feld­man Bar­rett writes: “Be­ing cu­ri­ous about your friend’s ex­pe­ri­ence is more im­por­tant than be­ing right.”</p>
    <p>Deeper con­ver­sa­tions help peo­ple be­come ex­pli­ca­ble to each other and them­selves. You can’t re­ally know your­self un­til you know how you ex­press your­self and find your­self in an­other’s eyes. Deeper con­ver­sa­tion builds trust, the oxy­gen of society – ex­actly what we’re miss­ing right now.</p>
    <p>THE MIDWIFE MODEL</p>
    <p>Some­times peo­ple talk to solve a per­son’s prob­lem. The Rev­erend Mar­garet Guen­ther wrote that a good con­ver­sa­tion­al­ist in th­ese cases is like a midwife, help­ing the other per­son give birth to her own child.</p>
    <p>That means spend­ing a lot of time pa­tiently lis­ten­ing to the other per­son teach her­self through her nar­ra­tion, bring­ing forth her un­thought thoughts, sit­ting with an is­sue as it slowly changes un­der the pres­sure of joint at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>“To in­flu­ence ac­tions you need to give peo­ple a sense of con­trol,” neu­ro­sci­en­tist Tali Sharot writes. Deeper con­ver­sa­tions help peo­ple be­come ex­pli­ca­ble to each other and them­selves. You can’t re­ally know your­self un­til you know how you ex­press your­self and find your­self in an­other’s eyes. Deeper con­ver­sa­tion builds trust, the oxy­gen of society – ex­actly what we’re miss­ing right now.</p>
    <p>“Hu­mans need to be heard be­fore they will lis­ten,” writer Amanda Ri­p­ley says. It’s been a rough year for all that, but this Thanks­giv­ing, the pos­si­bil­ity of deep talk is still out there, even over Zoom.</p>
