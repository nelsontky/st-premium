    <p>The charms of cream cheese are many: It’s thick and spreads beau­ti­fully on crack­ers, toast or bagels. It has a rich mouth feel that makes desserts such as Burnt Basque Cheese­cake taste deca­dent. The fat in it wraps around the palate, pum­melling it with waves of salty, creamy good­ness.</p>
    <p>A group of biotech­nol­ogy stu­dents at Repub­lic Poly­tech­nic has come up with a cream-cheese-like prod­uct us­ing okara or soya pulp, the by-prod­uct of soya milk and tofu man­u­fac­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>They are look­ing to sell it to com­pa­nies ready to turn this nutritious food waste into some­thing palat­able.</p>
    <p>The group has come up with three prod­ucts: the cream-cheese-like spread, sliced cheese and de­hy­drated gran­ules that, when mixed with hot wa­ter, be­come a thick­ish soup.</p>
    <p>Their cream cheese ticks all the nutri­tion boxes too, when com­pared with the real thing.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, 100g of their cheese has 173 calo­ries, com­pared with 335 calo­ries in the real thing. There is slightly more pro­tein in the soya cream cheese – 9.6g ver­sus 7g in the real thing. The soya cream cheese also has zero choles­terol and 3.9g of di­etary fi­bre. In terms of fat, the soya cream cheese has 3.7 times less fat than the real thing. How­ever, it has more car­bo­hy­drate – 13.9g – com­pared with 2.6g in the real thing.</p>
    <p>The three prod­ucts also con­tain plant-based Do­cosa­hex­aenoic acid or DHA, an Omega-3 fatty acid that sup­ports brain func­tion and eye health. It is usu­ally found in oily fish such as salmon and an­chovies, dairy prod­ucts and grass-fed meat.</p>
    <p>What ex­cites the team is that its cheese is made with some­thing that is usu­ally dis­carded.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore, the team says, gen­er­ates 30 tonnes of okara a day. Get­ting rid of food waste leads to land­fill and green­house emis­sions prob­lems. Plus, the poly­tech­nic had worked with soya milk chain Mr Bean to use okara in a suc­cess­ful gra­nola bar prod­uct, and was keen to see what else could be done with the nutritious by-prod­uct.</p>
    <p>But how would the team turn some­thing with very lit­tle fat into cream cheese, which has lash­ings of it?</p>
    <p>The an­swer, it turns out, comes in part from rot­ting leaves.</p>
    <p>Dr Heng Kiang Soon, who su­per­vises the team, says that as a kid, he was al­ways cu­ri­ous about how fallen leaves from a tree would break down into com­post. And why cows can di­gest grass when hu­mans can­not.</p>
    <p>Mi­cro­bial ac­tion turns leaves into com­post, and en­zymes al­low cows to process the cel­lu­lose in grass.</p>
    <p>So he and the team set out to find the right friendly bac­te­ria and en­zymes that could be used to fer­ment the okara, break­ing down the in­sol­u­ble fi­bre in it and re­leas­ing its nutritious prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>Dr Heng says: “Af­ter months of tri­als, we found the right friendly bac­te­ria and the right en­zyme. The cost of pro­duc­tion is com­pa­ra­ble with pro­duc­ing dairy cheese and does not re­quire so­phis­ti­cated ingredient­s.”</p>
    <p>The team mem­bers whom The Sun­day Times met – third-year diploma stu­dents Mo­hamed Ab­dul Rah­man, 19; Ja­cob Ash­ley Khairudin, 20; Muham­mad Haziq Haron, 19; and Chin Loong Sang, 20 – are avowed fans of soya.</p>
    <p>They say their method can turn a vat of okara into cheese within a day, and the mi­crobe and en­zyme they use are com­mer­cially avail­able.</p>
    <p>Mr Muham­mad Haziq Haron says: “We had to watch the amount of salt we added to the cheese, to make sure it’s healthy.”</p>
    <p>Team co­or­di­na­tor Mo­hamed Ab­dul Rah­man says nuts add tex­ture and flavour to the prod­uct, but res­o­lutely de­clines to give de­tails.</p>
    <p>Trade se­crets aside, the cheese they have de­vel­oped over months seems to have po­ten­tial, be­ing suit­able for veg­e­tar­i­ans, ve­g­ans and peo­ple with lac­tose and ca­sein al­ler­gies.</p>
    <p>For The Sun­day Times taste test, they boosted the flavour of the cream cheese with Ital­ian dried herb sea­son­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Mo­hamed Ab­dul Rah­man says: “Peo­ple think they are go­ing to taste soya. Do you taste soya? If I told you it was cream cheese, you would be­lieve me, right?”</p>
    <p>Well, see the other story.</p>
