    <p>Oys­ters and lobsters from France, ar­ti­sanal bread flour from the United States, wagyu from Ja­pan – a whole new world opened up for home cooks in Sin­ga­pore dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>They could – and still can – have their pick of in­gre­di­ents that used to be avail­able only to restau­rants.</p>
    <p>When din­ing in restau­rants was not al­lowed dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, com­pa­nies that sup­ply them with meat, veg­eta­bles, fruit and wine were stuck with in­ven­tory they could not move.</p>
    <p>Many started tak­ing or­ders from re­tail cus­tomers, who were also strug­gling to find what they needed at their nor­mal shop­ping haunts.</p>
    <p>Of course, savvy shop­pers here have al­ways been able to buy good seafood, beef and other pro­duce from sup­pli­ers who might do a lit­tle re­tail business. But it has never been on this scale.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies such as FoodXer­vices, Gourmet Part­ner Sin­ga­pore (above, with oys­ters from Les Huitres Cadoret ) and Clas­sic Deli piv­oted to cater to re­tail cus­tomers, who can buy items in re­tail-friendly or large quan­ti­ties, de­pend­ing on their needs. The prices they pay are the same or close to what restau­rants pay.</p>
    <p>New com­pa­nies such as Yakiniku Plaza, whose par­ent com­pany sup­plies restau­rants, ap­peared. It sells Hokkaido beef and pork to re­tail cus­tomers – the same meats its par­ent com­pany sup­plies to more than 200 restau­rants here.</p>
    <p>And just like that, home cooks have more re­sources to make restau­rant-qual­ity meals, and this looks to be a trend that will con­tinue. Why pay re­tail prices any­more?</p>
