    <p>In­done­sia’s econ­omy con­tracted by 5.32 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter com­pared with a year ago – its first neg­a­tive per­for­mance in 21 years.</p>
    <p>The con­trac­tion was led by two sec­tors – trans­porta­tion and logistics, as well as ho­tel, food and bev­er­ages – as over­all de­mand all but dis­ap­peared due to the on­go­ing coron­avirus pan­demic and par­tial lock­downs im­posed in cap­i­tal Jakarta and around the coun­try.</p>
    <p>South-east Asia’s big­gest econ­omy ex­panded by 2.97 per cent year on year in the first quar­ter.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia’s Na­tional Sta­tis­tics Agency (BPS) an­nounced yes­ter­day that the April-to-June per­for­mance was the worst quar­ter since the first quar­ter of 1999, when the econ­omy shrank by 6.13 per cent due to lin­ger­ing ef­fects from the 1997/1998 Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The trans­porta­tion and logistics sec­tor shrank by 31 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter, com­pared with the same pe­riod a year ago. The ho­tel, food and bev­er­ages sec­tor con­tracted by 22 per cent, ac­cord­ing to BPS.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia re­ported its first Covid-19 case in early March and in the fol­low­ing month, cities and prov­inces started to im­pose so­called large-scale so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures (PSBB) – equiv­a­lent to a par­tial lock­down.</p>
    <p>The PSBB dras­ti­cally re­duced train and bus ser­vices, prac­ti­cally banned in­ter­city travel, while res­tau­rants and food out­lets se­verely re­stricted their busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>In June, Jakarta and scores of other re­gions started to lift part of the re­stric­tions, in­clud­ing al­low­ing res­tau­rants to re­open and use up to half of the seat­ing ca­pac­ity, and let­ting work­ers go to the of­fice on al­ter­nate days and work on a stag­gered sched­ule, to avoid crowd­ing in lifts.</p>
    <p>Fre­quently used as a gauge for con­sumer de­mand, sales of mo­tor­cy­cles, cars and ce­ment saw sig­nif­i­cant de­clines in the sec­ond quar­ter, BPS said.</p>
    <p>The ship­ment of mo­tor­cy­cles from man­u­fac­tur­ers to deal­er­ships fell by 80 per cent year on year in the sec­ond quar­ter to 313,625 units.</p>
    <p>In the same pe­riod, sales of cars fell by 89 per cent to 24,042, and the pro­duc­tion of ce­ment dropped by 9 per cent.</p>
    <p>For­eign tourist ar­rivals in the sec­ond quar­ter plunged by 88 per cent to 482,650 dur­ing the same pe­riod, com­pared with the AprilJune pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>“We no­ticed a pick-up in buy­ing power in July, but com­pared with the year-ear­lier pe­riod it was still way weaker,” the head of BPS, Mr Kecuk Suhariyant­o, said in a hint that things may be im­prov­ing in the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>“Let us hope the sec­ond quar­ter be the only quar­ter with a neg­a­tive growth,” Mr Kecuk said.</p>
    <p>The ad­min­is­tra­tion of Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo is putting in ef­forts to avoid a re­ces­sion, usu­ally in­di­cated by two con­sec­u­tive quar­ters of neg­a­tive growth, by driv­ing more so­cial aid spend­ing such as grants and sub­sidised loans in the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>The ef­forts, how­ever, have been par­tially ham­pered by the coun­try’s weak data­base sys­tem that could en­sure funds would reach el­i­gi­ble re­cip­i­ents quickly.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian bu­reau­crats have also been slow to dis­burse the funds for fear of be­ing wrongly ac­cused of em­bez­zling gov­ern­ment funds.</p>
    <p>PICK-UP SEEN IN JULY</p>
    <p>We no­ticed a pick-up in buy­ing power in July, but com­pared with the year-ear­lier pe­riod it was still way weaker. ’’</p>
    <p>MR KECUK SUHARIYANT­O, head of In­done­sia’s Na­tional Sta­tis­tics Agency, hint­ing that things may be im­prov­ing in the third quar­ter.</p>
