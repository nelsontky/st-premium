    <p>BEI­JING • China’s largest chip­maker said its US sup­pli­ers have been i ssued with l et­ters telling them they are sub­ject to ad­di­tional ex­port re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Semi­con­duc­tor Man­u­fac­tur­ing In­ter­na­tional Corp (SMIC) is eval­u­at­ing the im­pact of the US Bureau of In­dus­try and Se­cu­rity’s ex­port re­stric­tions, which could have “ma­te­rial ad­verse ef­fects” on its pro­duc­tion and oper­a­tions, it said on Sun­day, con­firm­ing re­ports last week of the con­trols.</p>
    <p>The chip­maker has had pre­lim­i­nary ex­changes with the bureau in re­la­tion to the ex­port re­stric­tions and will con­tinue to ac­tively fa­cil­i­tate com­mu­ni­ca­tions with rel­e­vant US gov­ern­ment de­part­ments.</p>
    <p>Last month, Reuters re­ported that the bureau had is­sued letters in­form­ing cer­tain firms that they must hence­forth ob­tain a li­cence be­fore con­tin­u­ing to sup­ply goods and ser­vices to SMIC. The let­ter stated that ex­ports to SMIC “may pose an un­ac­cept­able risk of di­ver­sion to a mil­i­tary end use” to China.</p>
    <p>While the US Com­merce De­part­ment stopped short of plac­ing the chip­maker on the so-called en­tity list, the mea­sures mean SMIC has be­come the lat­est Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy com­pany to be tar­geted by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion amid an es­ca­la­tion of ten­sions be­tween Washington and Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers have warned that US firms may suf­fer more as a re­sult of Washington’s lat­est move on SMIC.</p>
    <p>China’s na­tion­al­is­tic news­pa­per Global Times on Sun­day said the move sig­nals to Chi­nese com­pa­nies that mak­ing com­pro­mises on their part would not lead to any con­ces­sions from the United States. China may also re­act by re­leas­ing an un­re­li­able en­tity list.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing-based In­for­ma­tion Con­sump­tion Al­liance’s di­rec­tor-gen­eral Xi­ang Li­gang told Global Times the US re­stric­tions may push tech gi­ant Huawei Tech­nolo­gies – one of SMIC’s clients and an­other tar­get of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion – to col­lab­o­rate with SMIC. To­gether, they might achieve a break­through to counter the US sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>China’s For­eign Min­istry said in a brief­ing last Mon­day it would “con­tinue to take nec­es­sary mea­sures to safe­guard Chi­nese busi­nesses’ le­git­i­mate rights and in­ter­ests”.</p>
    <p>SMIC said it has been op­er­at­ing in com­pli­ance with the rel­e­vant laws and reg­u­la­tions of all ju­ris­dic­tions where it per­forms its busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>The com­pany also said it had no re­la­tion­ship with China’s mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>SMIC is China’s largest semi­con­duc­tor foundry, though it trails be­hind Tai­wan Semi­con­duc­tor Man­u­fac­tur­ing, the global mar­ket leader.</p>
    <p>Both com­pa­nies rely heav­ily on equip­ment from com­pa­nies based in the US or US-al­lied coun­tries to pro­duce chips for clients.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has taken a raft of ac­tions to hob­ble Chi­nese tech firms, cit­ing na­tional se­cu­rity risks. This has in­cluded putting Huawei on its trade black­list and or­der­ing TikTok owner ByteDance to di­vest the short-form video app.</p>
