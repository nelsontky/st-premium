    <p>A woman was ex­er­cis­ing i n Sungei Api Api Park in Pasir Ris when she was at­tacked by a wild boar on Tues­day night.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Shin Min Daily News, the 50-year-old au­di­tor, who wanted to be known only as Madam Yu, was walk­ing home with her hus­band in the park at around 9.30pm when they sighted the an­i­mal near Pasir Ris Drive 3.</p>
    <p>The wild boar emerged from the fo­liage to her left and charged at her, Madam Yu told Shin Min.</p>
    <p>“I felt a lot of pain in my left leg when I was knocked down.”</p>
    <p>The boar ran away af­ter charg­ing at her. The whole in­ci­dent hap­pened in a mat­ter of sec­onds.</p>
    <p>It left Madam Yu with a 10cm cut on her left leg and fa­cial in­juries, Shin Min re­ported.</p>
    <p>Her hus­band rushed home to get the car and drove her to the hos­pi­tal, where she is ex­pected to stay un­til to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Madam Yu told the Chi­nese-lan­guage news­pa­per that she cried the whole night be­cause of what had hap­pened and does not dare to re­turn to the park to ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to queries from The Straits Times yes­ter­day, the Na­tional Parks Board (NParks) ad­vised the pub­lic to avoid feed­ing wild boars as this might cause them to as­so­ciate hu­mans with food providers and there­fore ap­proach them.</p>
    <p>“This may lead to them dis­play­ing aggressive be­hav­iour to­wards peo­ple, ven­tur­ing into ur­ban ar­eas in search of hu­man sources of food and wan­der­ing onto roads, pos­ing a po­ten­tial dan­ger to mo­torists and to them­selves,” said NParks di­rec­tor of wildlife man­age­ment How Choon Beng.</p>
    <p>The last re­ported in­ci­dent of a wild boar at­tack was on Aug 28, 2018, near Pung­gol Sec­ondary School, when a preg­nant woman was left with deep cuts on her right calf.</p>
