    <p>LON­DON • Red Bull see plenty of un­tapped po­ten­tial in Alex Albon and are happy with the Bri­tish-born Thai, ac­cord­ing to team boss Chris­tian Horner.</p>
    <p>Wil­liams driver Ge­orge Rus­sell de­fended his friend and ri­val at last week­end’s Hun­gar­ian Grand Prix, say­ing he was “be­ing made to look like an id­iot and he’s ab­so­lutely not” af­ter Albon qual­i­fied 13th while team­mate Max Ver­stap­pen started in sev­enth.</p>
    <p>Albon was heard on the ra­dio ear­lier com­plain­ing to his team about send­ing him out into traf­fic for his fi­nal run in the sec­ond phase of qual­i­fy­ing.</p>
    <p>But the 24-year-old, a Formula One rookie last year along­side team­mate Max Ver­stap­pen, ul­ti­mately put in a strong per­for­mance to fin­ish fifth at the Hun­garor­ing, with Ver­stap­pen sec­ond be­hind Mercedes’ Lewis Hamil­ton.</p>
    <p>“I’m very pleased with Alex. He’s picked up a bit of crit­i­cism, which has been very harsh on him,” Red Bull team boss Chris­tian Horner told Sky Sports TV.</p>
    <p>“We made a mis­take in the tim­ing (in qual­i­fy­ing), we put too much pres­sure on him. We have to take re­spon­si­bil­ity for that.</p>
    <p>“He’s done the pass­ing ma­noeu­vres when he needed to, he’s re­sponded very well. I re­ally be­lieve that Alex has got a lot more po­ten­tial that we just haven’t un­cov­ered yet.”</p>
    <p>Ver­stap­pen has al­ready en­joyed two podium plac­ings this sea­son, fin­ish­ing run­ner-up in Hun­gary, while Albon, who is fifth in the cham­pi­onship stand­ings, is still wait­ing for his maiden podium.</p>
    <p>Horner ac­knowl­edged that the RB16 was a dif­fi­cult car to drive at the mo­ment, with both driv­ers spin­ning fre­quently and strug­gling dur­ing prac­tice in Hun­gary, and that Albon was do­ing well given the cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>“Max’s abil­ity to drive around those prob­lems, that’s ex­pe­ri­ence on Max’s side that Alex doesn’t have,” he said. “He will get (that), and he is get­ting stronger and stronger.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, cham­pi­onship leader Hamil­ton ex­pects an empty Sil­ver­stone to feel “su­per weird” with F1 next stag­ing back-to-back races at the Bri­tish cir­cuit.</p>
    <p>The first three races in Aus­tria and Hun­gary have been held with­out spec­ta­tors due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, and that will re­main the case at what was the best at­tended grand prix last year.</p>
    <p>Sil­ver­stone will host the Bri­tish Grand Prix on Aug 2, fol­lowed by the 70th An­niver­sary Grand Prix the week­end af­ter, and it is the en­ergy the crowd brings that the Bri­ton misses the most.</p>
    <p>“The Bri­tish Grand Prix is the best, par­tic­u­larly be­cause of the fans, the thou­sands that turn up and re­ally cre­ate the spec­ta­cle,” said the six-time world cham­pion.</p>
    <p>“That is something I am still com­ing to terms with. The at­mos­phere, for me, it’s night and day dif­fer­ent.”</p>
    <p>He has won a record six times at Sil­ver­stone, cel­e­brat­ing in the past by crowd surf­ing. While that will not be pos­si­ble this year, there is ev­ery like­li­hood of him adding to his two-win tally this term, with Mercedes in a class of their own.</p>
    <p>EX­PE­RI­ENCE WILL COME</p>
    <p>Max’s abil­ity to drive around those prob­lems, that’s ex­pe­ri­ence on Max’s side that Alex doesn’t have. He will get (that), and he is get­ting stronger and stronger. ’’</p>
