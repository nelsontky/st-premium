    <p>It looks like there is no hope of rec­on­cil­i­a­tion be­tween Tai­wanese pop star Show Lo and his for­mer girl­friend Grace Chow.</p>
    <p>Chow, 31, con­firmed what many had sus­pected when she an­nounced in April that she had bro­ken up with Lo, her boyfriend of nine years.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese in­flu­encer ac­cused Lo of host­ing sex par­ties and hav­ing “im­proper re­la­tions” with tele­vi­sion host Linda Chien, one of his co-hosts on long-run­ning va­ri­ety pro­gramme 100% En­ter­tain­ment (1997 to present).</p>
    <p>She then un­fol­lowed Lo, who turned 41 last Thurs­day, on sev­eral so­cial me­dia plat­forms, in­clud­ing Weibo and In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he did not fol­low suit and apol­o­gised soon af­ter she ac­cused him of cheat­ing on her.</p>
    <p>Lo put out a long so­cial me­dia post in May, where he de­tailed their re­la­tion­ship and apol­o­gised to her again.</p>
    <p>Some saw the post as an at­tempt to woo back his for­mer girl­friend, while oth­ers said he was try­ing to sal­vage his af­fected im­age. He has been dropped from sev­eral va­ri­ety shows in China af­ter her ex­plo­sive reve­la­tions on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>There was talk of a rec­on­cil­i­a­tion af­ter Chow posted on so­cial me­dia a photo of her club­bing with Lo’s good friend, Chi­nese street dancer Mr Three, last week. This was swiftly re­futed by her.</p>
    <p>Lo seems to have taken the hint, as sharp-eyed ne­ti­zens no­ticed on Sun­day that he has un­fol­lowed Chow on sev­eral so­cial me­dia plat­forms.</p>
    <p>He has also un­fol­lowed Chien, 36, on In­sta­gram, although he is still fol­low­ing her on Weibo.</p>
