    <p>A babysit­ter was found guilty yes­ter­day of poi­son­ing two ba­bies un­der her care with an as­sort­ment of medicines, in­clud­ing some used to treat in­som­nia and anx­i­ety disor­ders.</p>
    <p>After a trial, Dis­trict Judge John Ng con­victed Sa’adiah Ja­mari, 39, of two counts of ad­min­is­ter­ing poi­sons to the lit­tle girls with the in­tent to hurt them in sep­a­rate in­ci­dents in Novem­ber and De­cem­ber 2016.</p>
    <p>One of the girls was just five months old at the time, while the other was 11 months old. They are not re­lated to each other. The girls and their moth­ers can­not be named, ow­ing to a gag or­der to pro­tect the chil­dren’s iden­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the trial, the younger girl’s mother, 29, tes­ti­fied that she put up a no­tice on Face­book in Oc­to­ber 2016 stat­ing that she needed a babysit­ter for her baby and her older daugh­ter, who was then five years old.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Sa’adiah started tak­ing care of the girls in her Hougang flat in early Novem­ber that year. But after the first few vis­its, the mother no­ticed that her younger daugh­ter ap­peared “cranky” and would “throw” her milk bot­tle aside when she was be­ing fed.</p>
    <p>The mother told the judge dur­ing the trial ear­lier this year that she took her baby to Park­way East Hospi­tal the fol­low­ing month.</p>
    <p>The court heard that the daugh­ter was warded for about five days and the mother re­ceived a hospi­tal re­port list­ing mul­ti­ple sub­stances de­tected in the baby’s body.</p>
    <p>They in­cluded the sleep­ing drug temazepam, the an­ti­his­tamine chlor­pheni­ramine, and al­pra­zo­lam, which is used to treat anx­i­ety disor­ders. The mother alerted the po­lice in late De­cem­ber 2016.</p>
    <p>The 22-year-old mother of the older baby had also tes­ti­fied in court ear­lier. Dur­ing the trial, she told the court that she had posted on a Face­book group in De­cem­ber 2016 that she needed some­body to look after her baby on Christ­mas evening.</p>
    <p>Sa’adiah re­sponded to the mes­sage, and the mother took her child to the babysit­ter’s flat.</p>
    <p>At about 6am the next day, the mother’s boyfriend picked up the baby, and the woman no­ticed her in­fant seemed “tired”. The baby was taken to KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hospi­tal that day and ad­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Yan Ji­akang urged the judge to sen­tence Sa’adiah to seven years’ jail, stress­ing that the case in­volved vul­ner­a­ble and de­fence­less vic­tims.</p>
    <p>In mit­i­ga­tion, de­fence lawyer Chua Eng Hui said that Sa’adiah is divorced and a sin­gle mother of two. The court heard that she also had a his­tory of ma­jor de­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>Sa’adiah is now out on $10,000 bail and will be sen­tenced on Nov 24.</p>
