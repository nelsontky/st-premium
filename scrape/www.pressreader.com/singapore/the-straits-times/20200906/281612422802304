    <p>TOKYO • The Ja­pan Coast Guard yes­ter­day sus­pended its search for the crew miss­ing from a cat­tle ship in the East China Sea due to bad weather from a ty­phoon.</p>
    <p>A third crew­man from the Gulf Live­stock 1, which cap­sized in a storm off Ja­pan with a crew of 43 and a cargo of nearly 6,000 cat­tle, was found alive on Fri­day af­ter he was spot­ted by a search plane.</p>
    <p>Filipino Jay-nel Ros­als, 30, was found on a life raft wav­ing for help 2km off Ko­dakara­jima, a small is­land in Ja­pan’s south­ern Kagoshima pre­fec­ture. He was con­scious and able to walk when the coast guard res­cued him.</p>
    <p>Res­cuers also found an over­turned orange lifeboat float­ing at sea some 4km off Ko­dakara­jima, but no one was on that boat.</p>
    <p>The search con­tin­ued through noon, Ja­pan time, with­out find­ing more crew, but ves­sels, air­planes and divers were pulled out due to bad weather, said Mr Jun­pei Sak­aguchi, an of­fi­cer at the search and res­cue divi­sion at the 10th re­gional maritime safety head­quar­ters of the coast guard.</p>
    <p>“We plan to re­sume the search when sea and weather con­di­tions im­prove, but we don’t know when that would be as it will de­pend on the weather,” he said.</p>
    <p>The pow­er­ful Ty­phoon Haishen – a much stronger storm than the ear­lier Ty­phoon Maysak – is ap­proach­ing south-western Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>Weather fore­cast­ers warn of heavy rain­fall, huge waves, high tides and strong winds of up to 290km per hour, mak­ing it a “vi­o­lent” storm on the top level of the coun­try’s clas­si­fi­ca­tion scale.</p>
    <p>The Gulf Live­stock 1 sent a dis­tress call from the west of Amami Oshima is­land in south-western Ja­pan on Wed­nes­day as Ty­phoon Maysak lashed the area with strong winds and big waves.</p>
    <p>It had lost en­gine power be­fore it was hit by a mas­sive wave, ac­cord­ing to the first sur­vivor who was found on Wed­nes­day evening.</p>
    <p>The body of a sec­ond crew­man was re­cov­ered at sea on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The crew on board the ship was made up of 39 Filipinos, two New Zealan­ders and two Aus­tralians. The ves­sel had been trav­el­ling from Napier in New Zealand to the Chi­nese port of Tang­shan.</p>
    <p>On Fri­day, it emerged that the ship, owned by Gulf Nav­i­ga­tion based in the United Arab Emi­rates, had a his­tory of me­chan­i­cal is­sues.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral maritime re­ports logged over the past two years showed the ship had op­er­a­tional con­cerns.</p>
    <p>A De­cem­ber in­spec­tion re­port from the In­done­sian author­i­ties on the web­site of Equa­sis, which col­lates ship safety in­for­ma­tion from both pub­lic and pri­vate sources, logged is­sues with the ship’s propul­sion and aux­il­iary ma­chin­ery.</p>
    <p>The is­sues in­cluded “de­fi­cien­cies” with the propul­sion main en­gine, gauges and ther­mome­ters.</p>
