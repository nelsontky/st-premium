    <p>Fur­ther con­sol­i­da­tion could be on the cards for the fin­tech in­dus­try in Hong Kong and the main­land in the next 12 months amid greater scru­tiny by reg­u­la­tors, and dig­i­tal cur­rency could be a bright spot, some play­ers say.</p>
    <p>Mr David Rosa, co-founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of dig­i­tal pay­ment ser­vices fin­tech firm Neat, ex­pects merg­ers to grow “by quite a bit” as reg­u­la­tors move to plug loop­holes and main­tain fi­nan­cial sus­tain­abil­ity even as firms are more fo­cused on user ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>“What I think is go­ing to be re­ally tough for a lot of the play­ers is the re­al­i­sa­tion that if they want to con­tinue to touch cus­tomers’ money, they have to be able to call the com­pli­ance de­part­ment and they have to have cor­po­rate gov­er­nance.</p>
    <p>“You’re go­ing to have to play on the same level play­ing field (as banks) if you want to con­tinue to touch the cus­tomers’ money and that is some­thing that’s go­ing to hit the in­dus­try in quite some fash­ion in the next 12 months,” Mr Rosa said in an in­ter­view with The Straits Times on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The is­sue of bal­anc­ing fi­nan­cial risks and free­dom of in­no­va­tion in the fin­tech space – not pe­cu­liar to China where rules are not as pre­scrip­tive as those in</p>
    <p>Hong Kong – came un­der the spot­light in re­cent days, fol­low­ing Ant Group’s sus­pended dual list­ing that led to a US$290 bil­lion (S$392 bil­lion) wipe­out in stocks from Chi­nese giants Alibaba Group and Ten­cent Hold­ings ear­lier in the week.</p>
    <p>Mr Ben­jamin Quin­lan, chair­man of the Fin­Tech As­so­ci­a­tion of Hong Kong, said: “If you look at any mar­ket with fin­tech that’s pro­lif­er­at­ing, that’s com­pletely un­reg­u­lated, it’s ex­tremely dan­ger­ous and I’ve seen many ex­pe­ri­ences where peo­ple have lost a lot of money, they’re get­ting burnt.”</p>
    <p>So com­pa­nies that want to play in the fi­nan­cial ser­vices space need to abide by what is best prac­tice, he said, and as that hap­pens, “the quan­tity of in­no­va­tion might de­crease as will the num­ber of com­pa­nies, but the qual­ity of in­no­va­tion will be bet­ter”.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Wong Kam Fai, who is di­rec­tor at the Centre for In­no­va­tion and Tech­nol­ogy of the Chi­nese Univer­sity of</p>
    <p>Hong Kong, agreed, point­ing to the many ex­am­ples of suc­cess on the main­land such as in the elec­tronic pay­ment area with the rise of QR codes and dig­i­tal wal­lets, even as rules were tight­ened.</p>
    <p>And although the re­cent Ant Group saga may have erased some of the op­ti­mism in the sec­tor, with China mov­ing to fo­cus on dig­i­tal cur­rency or elec­tronic ren­minbi (e-RMB), ob­servers see lots of op­por­tu­ni­ties for</p>
    <p>Hong Kong play­ers.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal cur­ren­cies are a bright spot and pub­lic-pri­vate part­ner­ships with cen­tral banks in this area are “su­per ex­cit­ing”, said Mr Rosa, while Prof Wong pointed out that e-RMB will have to go in­ter­na­tional sub­se­quently, set­ting the stage for Hong Kong to play a key role and “be an in­ter­na­tional e-RMB centre for the main­land”.</p>
    <p>Mr Zen­non Kapron, founder of fin­tech con­sul­tancy Kaprona­sia, thinks dig­i­tal cur­rency is “cer­tainly an op­por­tu­nity for the gov­ern­ment, but not nec­es­sar­ily specif­i­cally for fin­techs”.</p>
    <p>In­stead, he is more hope­ful about fi­nan­cial in­clu­sion where there is a huge gap on the main­land.</p>
    <p>“There’s still a num­ber of peo­ple who are fi­nan­cially ex­cluded in China and don’t have ac­cess to fi­nan­cial prod­ucts and ser­vices, and so, for me, China has done a tremen­dous amount over the past cou­ple of decades of bring­ing peo­ple into the fi­nan­cial ecosys­tem, but there’s still more that can be done... How do we democra­tise fi­nance for the un­der­served?”</p>
    <p>He said the pan­demic has shown the im­por­tance of dig­i­tal fi­nance for con­sumers and busi­nesses across the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion, so the im­por­tance of plat­forms in­clud­ing Ten­cent, Grab and Go­jek will only rise in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Still, there are chal­lenges for the in­dus­try in Hong Kong and the main­land.</p>
    <p>“Hong Kong is still ar­guably the most open mar­ket around and so you have com­plete free­dom of cap­i­tal in and out of the ter­ri­tory whereas you don’t have that in China. So that ac­tu­ally changes the dy­nam­ics of the end-prod­uct in the mar­ket and the for­mat for th­ese dig­i­tal cur­ren­cies,” said Mr Rosa.</p>
    <p>He also said the big­gest chal­lenge in China now is its abil­ity to ex­port its prod­ucts or so­lu­tions to the world, whereas the ob­sta­cle for Hong Kong is how the city can make it­self “rel­e­vant in the global mar­ket rather than do­mes­tic mar­ket”.</p>
    <p>China’s dig­i­tal econ­omy grew 15.6 per cent last year to</p>
    <p>35.8 tril­lion yuan (S$7.3 tril­lion).</p>
    <p>It made up 36.2 per cent of the coun­try’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct, ac­cord­ing to the China Academy of In­for­ma­tion and Com­mu­ni­ca­tions Tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Hong Kong is home to more than 600 fin­tech com­pa­nies and start-ups, in­clud­ing eight uni­corns.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial Sec­re­tary Paul Chan said at a vir­tual wealth man­age­ment event ear­lier this week that in the first seven months of the year, more than 20 Hong Kong-based start-ups raised nearly US$500 mil­lion in ven­ture fund­ing.</p>
    <p>As of Au­gust, eight vir­tual banks and four vir­tual in­sur­ers have been au­tho­rised, or granted in-prin­ci­ple agree­ment, to op­er­ate in Hong Kong, of which seven vir­tual banks have started to pro­vide ser­vices to the pub­lic.</p>
