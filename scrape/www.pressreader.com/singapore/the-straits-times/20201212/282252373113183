    <p>With ex­pe­ri­ences such as con­fronta­tions with sea rob­bers and re­spond­ing to may­day calls, Mil­i­tary Ex­pert 3 (ME3) Chua Buan Hee has had an exciting and re­ward­ing ca­reer span­ning 26 years.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic of Sin­ga­pore Navy (RSN) sailor started his naval ad­ven­ture on the first-of-class RSS Fear­less in 1995 and had three stints on Fear­less-class pa­trol ves­sels (PVs).</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the 44-year-old coxswain of RSS Gal­lant was filled with emo­tion as he watched the ship’s com­mis­sion­ing pen­nant be­ing low­ered from its sail.</p>
    <p>The low­er­ing of the pen­nant dur­ing a de­com­mis­sion­ing cer­e­mony marks the of­fi­cial end of a ship’s mil­i­tary ser­vice in the RSN.</p>
    <p>RSS Gal­lant and RSS Free­dom are the last of 11 op­er­a­tional PVs to be de­com­mis­sioned. The PVs have been re­placed by eight of the faster and more ca­pa­ble lit­toral mis­sion ves­sels, which have been fully op­er­a­tional since Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing with re­porters on board RSS Gal­lant on Thurs­day, ME3 Chua said: “Of course I’ll be sad, but we still need to move on. With the lit­toral mis­sion ves­sels on­line to re­place the PVs, we have got to be happy, be­cause we need to evolve to meet fu­ture threats.”</p>
    <p>At sun­set, dur­ing the cer­e­mony at Tuas Naval Base yes­ter­day, the Chief of Navy, Rear-Ad­mi­ral (RADM) Aaron Beng, or­dered the de­com­mis­sion­ing of RSS Gal­lant and RSS Free­dom as the of­fi­ci­at­ing of­fi­cer. RSS Free­dom was com­mis­sioned in 1998 and RSS Gal­lant a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>De­liv­er­ing the ci­ta­tions for the two ships, the com­man­der of the Mar­itime Se­cu­rity Task Force, RADM Yong Wei Hsi­ung, said they each sailed 314,000 nau­ti­cal miles – enough to cir­cum­nav­i­gate the earth 12 times – to de­fend Sin­ga­pore’s wa­ters and sup­port its de­fence re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>“The mag­ni­tude of their con­tri­bu­tions is out­stand­ing. This would not have been pos­si­ble with­out the un­wa­ver­ing ded­i­ca­tion, pro­fes­sion­al­ism, tenac­ity and sac­ri­fices of many gen­er­a­tions of of­fi­cers and crew who served on board,” he told the past and present crew of the ships, and se­nior RSN of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>The PVs will not fully re­tire yet, with four of them ear­marked for re­fur­bish­ment as part of ef­forts to bet­ter pro­tect Sin­ga­pore’s ter­ri­to­rial wa­ters and re­spond to mar­itime se­cu­rity threats.</p>
    <p>ME3 Chua was part of the pi­o­neer crew of the RSN’s first PV, RSS Fear­less, launched in 1995. He learnt his ropes as a ju­nior gun­ner on the ves­sel from 1995 to 1997 – his first post­ing af­ter he signed on.</p>
    <p>In his sec­ond PV stint on RSS Brave from 2004 to 2007 as Chief Ord­nance Sys­tem, he ex­pe­ri­enced some of the most exciting days of his ca­reer, re­spond­ing to emer­gency calls, in­clud­ing one in­volv­ing sea rob­bers. In an­other in­ci­dent, RSS Brave spot­ted a boat with two out­board mo­tors and more than 10 peo­ple, whom they sus­pected were il­le­gal im­mi­grants.</p>
    <p>While at RSS Brave, ME3 Chua was also in­volved in pa­trol op­er­a­tions around Pe­dra Branca – be­fore the is­land lo­cated about 40km off east­ern Sin­ga­pore was awarded to Sin­ga­pore in an In­ter­na­tional Court of Jus­tice rul­ing in 2008.</p>
    <p>He be­lieves that pas­sion for the job, be­ing able to sail around the world and the fam­ily spirit in the navy have kept him go­ing.</p>
    <p>While he is not sure where he will be posted to next, he said: “Wher­ever the navy needs me, I will go.”</p>
