    <p>Sin­ga­pore is con­tin­u­ing to seek new re­gions to es­tab­lish travel bub­bles with, even as the launch of the first such ar­range­ment with Hong Kong re­mains on hold, Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Coun­tries that the Repub­lic has uni­lat­er­ally opened its bor­ders to make nat­u­ral part­ners for po­ten­tial air travel bub­bles, Mr Ong told re­porters on the side­lines of a com­mu­nity event.</p>
    <p>Short-term vis­i­tors from Aus­tralia, Brunei, China, New Zealand and Viet­nam are cur­rently al­lowed to en­ter Sin­ga­pore and travel freely as these coun­tries are deemed to have com­pre­hen­sive public health sur­veil­lance sys­tems and suc­cess­fully con­trolled the spread of the Covid-19 virus.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers from these coun­tries need not serve a stay-home no­tice, but must ap­ply for an air travel pass, test neg­a­tive on ar­rival and down­load and use the TraceTo­gether app while here.</p>
    <p>“We hope they will re­cip­ro­cate. They can look at Sin­ga­pore’s num­bers – we are re­ally con­trol­ling the virus quite well for now... Hope­fully, I think some time next year, dif­fer­ent part­ners will be will­ing to open up travel bub­bles,” Mr Ong said.</p>
    <p>The start date for the Sin­ga­poreHong Kong bub­ble, ini­tially set for Nov 22, will be re­viewed be­tween Christ­mas and New Year, he said.</p>
    <p>“Look­ing at it be­tween my coun­ter­part and I, we de­cided there’s no point in try­ing to give any hope that it can be com­menced in the mid­dle of the month,” Mr Ong said.</p>
    <p>The Civil Avi­a­tion Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore said last week that both cities had de­cided to de­fer the start date to next year amid a re­cent spike in Covid-19 cases in Hong Kong. It had ear­lier been agreed that the ar­range­ment would be sus­pended if the seven-day moving av­er­age for un­linked cases ex­ceeded five in ei­ther city.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong re­ported 95 new cases yes­ter­day as the city faces a new wave of in­fec­tions and tighter curbs.</p>
    <p>“I think it is the cor­rect thing to do be­cause you can see right now the cases are at this level – they are not spik­ing very high, which we are happy to see, but at the same time it’s main­tain­ing at a cer­tain level,” Mr Ong said. “As for other part­ners, we are con­stantly look­ing.”</p>
