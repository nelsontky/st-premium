    <p>After the marathon, I said it was the first and last one I would take part in.</p>
    <p>MS JANNAH PAS­CUA, a for­eign do­mes­tic worker, re­call­ing her first marathon in 2011.</p>
    <p>Ms Jannah Pas­cua re­mem­bers what it was like to grow up in a poor house­hold in Ilo­cos Sur, a prov­ince in the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>With lit­tle money and food, she be­gan to work for her rel­a­tives at 12, so that she could put her­self through school and help sup­port her fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Know­ing that there are other peo­ple in sim­i­lar sit­u­a­tions is why help­ing the less for­tu­nate is im­por­tant to Ms Pas­cua, 46, who has been work­ing as a for­eign do­mes­tic worker in Sin­ga­pore since 2005.</p>
    <p>Since 2011, she has been rais­ing funds for var­i­ous or­gan­i­sa­tions such as Aidha and the Hu­man­i­tar­ian Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Mi­gra­tion Eco­nom­ics (Home) by par­tic­i­pat­ing in marathons and cy­cling events.</p>
    <p>Ms Pas­cua, who has three chil­dren be­tween the ages of 18 and 21 and last saw them two years ago, said: “I want to give back to the com­mu­nity be­cause I know the feel­ing of hav­ing noth­ing.</p>
    <p>“I came from a poor fam­ily and I know what it’s like to have noth­ing to eat and no money.”</p>
    <p>Ms Pas­cua, who was pre­vi­ously a stu­dent at Aidha, also vol­un­teers with the non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion – that mainly teaches maids how to man­age their money and start busi­nesses – twice a month.</p>
    <p>She helps to man­age the fi­nances of her farm back home while her hus­band han­dles the daily op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Ms Pas­cua has com­pleted seven marathons, four half-marathons and four OCBC Cy­cle events, and is part of a drag­onboat team.</p>
    <p>She was never an ac­tive per­son un­til she signed up for the Stan­dard Char­tered Sin­ga­pore Marathon in 2011 to raise funds for Aidha.</p>
    <p>With­out any proper train­ing, she strug­gled to com­plete the race, fin­ish­ing it just one minute un­der the cut-off time of eight hours.</p>
    <p>“It was a re­ally painful ex­pe­ri­ence. I nearly couldn’t fin­ish it be­cause half­way through, I felt that my body was aching.</p>
    <p>“I couldn’t run prop­erly so I had to walk. I was drag­ging my­self to the fin­ish line,” said Ms Pas­cua.</p>
    <p>“After the marathon, I said it was the first and last one I would take part in.”</p>
    <p>But in 2015, she de­cided to give the race an­other shot.</p>
    <p>Ini­tially, even 100m runs were tough, but she in­creased the dis­tance ev­ery night, be­fore even­tu­ally com­plet­ing her sec­ond marathon in about six hours.</p>
    <p>She usu­ally trains in the evenings after she has com­pleted most of her chores.</p>
    <p>She picked up cy­cling in 2017 be­cause of the OCBC Cy­cle and rented a bike at East Coast Park to par­tic­i­pate in the 42km cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>Since then, she has taken part in ev­ery edi­tion of the event.</p>
    <p>While the main aim of par­tic­i­pat­ing in these run­ning and cy­cling ac­tiv­i­ties is to raise funds, she also pushes her­self to bet­ter her time or cover a longer dis­tance.</p>
    <p>With the OCBC Cy­cle con­verted to a vir­tual event this year, she saw it as an op­por­tu­nity to com­plete her long­est ride ever by cy­cling 121km on Nov 1, al­most thrice the 42km she had done in the pre­vi­ous three edi­tions.</p>
    <p>This year, she is among more than 135 peo­ple who are part of Ride for Aidha 2020, which aims to raise $30,000 for its Gift of Ed­u­ca­tion cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Ms Pas­cua said: “I re­ally want to push my­self to my lim­its and... when I help to raise funds, I also want to show that it’s some­thing mean­ing­ful that is worth do­nat­ing to.”</p>
