    <p>Now that the kids are grow­ing tall and lanky like beansprout­s, it is harder for all four of us to squidge into two queen beds in a ho­tel room.</p>
    <p>Book­ing larger hol­i­day ac­com­mo­da­tion rather than get­ting two rooms is the next step, since be­ing at­tached at the hip is usu­ally the modus operandi for fam­ily va­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Our “Fam­ily To­gether” overnight stay­ca­tion at Oak­wood Premier AMTD Sin­ga­pore starts on a glam­orous note when a chauf­feur­driven Jaguar pulls up at our doorstep.</p>
    <p>The sedan, with built-in mas­sage seats and min­eral wa­ter and mag­a­zines on tap, moves as silently as a ninja to the ser­viced apart­ments in OUE Down­town 1. My seat can be re­clined, a sim­u­lacrum of an air­line seat, for those who miss fly­ing.</p>
    <p>Our two-bed­room ex­ec­u­tive apart­ment is a dreamier, de­signer ver­sion of home. If only our flat had walk-in wardrobes, taste­ful greige fur­ni­ture and a washer and dryer hid­den be­hind a se­cret wall.</p>
    <p>I am a kidult play­ing house with floors I will never have to clean.</p>
    <p>Be­fore long, we are watch­ing tele­vi­sion con­tent­edly in three rooms – the kids’ bed­room, ours and the liv­ing room. (In mod­ern fam­i­lies, free­dom from the tyranny of screens some­times just means lib­er­a­tion from wait­ing for your turn on an elec­tronic de­vice.)</p>
    <p>I used to avoid ser­viced apart­ments on overseas trips be­cause they re­mind me too much of do­mes­tic life. The kitchen em­anates silent re­proach, hint­ing that I should buy gro­ceries and rus­tle up din­ner, which does not make for a care­free hol­i­day. (My hus­band can cook only omelettes.)</p>
    <p>Here, I open a cab­i­net to find a ton of kitchen ap­pli­ances. I can use even a rice cooker, if only I had packed rice.</p>
    <p>Son, 11, and Daugh­ter, seven, take out pans and fol­low a recipe for a grilled cheese sand­wich pro­vided by Oak­wood. The bread and cheese are thought­fully stocked in the fridge. The kids have whipped this up a few times since, clearly snub­bing my ver­sion, which fea­tures cheese melted in a mi­crowave.</p>
    <p>At din­ner, we get a cus­tomis­able din­ing set worth $140++ with the kind of de­pend­able mains, in­volv</p>
    <p>ing salmon and bolog­nese, which lodge per­ma­nently on child­friendly menus.</p>
    <p>We even have a bar­tender.</p>
    <p>The Oak­wood Mo­bile Bar rolls round twice i n the evening, a wheeled char­iot of un­lim­ited house pours, cock­tails, beers, wine and four am­ple sets of canapes, one for each of us. That is a spread of close to 50 nib­bles, in­clud­ing Ja­panese dumplings and Ca­jun shrimp and gua­camole on toast.</p>
    <p>If you are some­how peck­ish later, wind down with hot soya milk and one of Oak­wood’s ex­cel­lent mac­arons dur­ing the turn­down ser­vice.</p>
    <p>It is quite the house party, and Covid-19 safe to boot. Plans are now afoot to re­vive Sin­ga­pore’s nightlife, which re­quire club­bers to pro­vide proof of hav­ing taken a Covid-19 test. But groups of five may pre­fer to party with a room­ser­viced bac­cha­na­lia here, in the thick of the Cen­tral Busi­ness District.</p>
    <p>Pan­demic mea­sures, while te­dious, can some­times bring a sense of splen­did iso­la­tion. We have booked ahead to go to the out­door in­fin­ity pool, which we have all to our­selves.</p>
    <p>In the still of the night, we see lights flick­er­ing from Sen­tosa and be­yond: St John’s, Lazarus and maybe even tiny Kusu Is­land. The ships are sleep­ing and</p>
    <p>the Ma­rina Coastal Ex­press­way is a rib­bon of road aglow with street lamps.</p>
    <p>It is an il­lu­sion, of course, but it is tempt­ing to think the view is ours alone.</p>
    <p>INSIDER TIP</p>
    <p>Check out the Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Cul­tural Cen­tre across the road for a closer look at the Chi­nese Sin­ga­porean iden­tity.</p>
    <p>Shrewdly, one of the high­lights is a dis­cus­sion on cross-cul­tural in­flu­ences on hawker food. The plas­tic repli­cas of chicken rice, Hokkien mee and curry puffs look good enough to eat.</p>
    <p>Did you know yong tau foo was cre­ated by Hakka emi­gres who longed for wheat dumplings from their home­land?</p>
