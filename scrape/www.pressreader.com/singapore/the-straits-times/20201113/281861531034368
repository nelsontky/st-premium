    <p>The sign­ing of the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (RCEP) agree­ment at the Asean sum­mit on Sun­day, which will for­malise the world’s largest trade deal in­volv­ing 15 coun­tries, will mark an im­por­tant mile­stone for Asian trade. The tim­ing is sig­nif­i­cant in that it comes as the newly elected Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion read­ies to take of­fice in the United States on Jan 20. But look­ing ahead, more changes in global trade ar­range­ments may be afoot. Judg­ing from what he has writ­ten and said, Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den wants to en­sure that the US, not China, should be writ­ing the rules that govern trade. Asian coun­tries should thus pre­pare for some sig­nif­i­cant changes in the ap­proach to trade by the world’s largest econ­omy. Many of them will be ben­e­fi­cial to the re­gion, but not all the lega­cies of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s trade poli­cies will be erased, and there may even be some new re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>On the pos­i­tive side, the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion, which supports mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism, will likely try to re­vive the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO), which is sup­posed to be the global watch­dog of world trade. But at the same time, it will push to re­form the in­sti­tu­tion to make it more rel­e­vant to cur­rent trade re­al­i­ties, which would be wel­come.</p>
    <p>An­other pos­i­tive is that it is un­likely to con­tinue the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s tar­iff wars. It will al­most cer­tainly re­move the Trump tar­iffs ap­plied on al­lies such as Canada and the Euro­pean Union. With China, how­ever, it might take a harder line.</p>
    <p>While it would roll back tar­iffs that hurt Amer­i­can busi­nesses and con­sumers, it might re­tain some as­pects of the phase one trade deal ne­go­ti­ated by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, such as agri­cul­tural pur­chase com­mit­ments by China. Any con­ces­sions it makes would prob­a­bly be con­di­tional on lib­er­al­i­sa­tion com­mit­ments by Bei­jing. Nor is it likely to let up on re­stric­tions on Chi­nese tech com­pa­nies such as Huawei, which US Democrats also re­gard as po­ten­tial se­cu­rity threats. Thus, trade ten­sions with China will per­sist, al­though there may be a change in tac­tics.</p>
    <p>The Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion has in­di­cated it will be cau­tious about sign­ing trade agree­ments, which may in­clude the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship, which al­though orig­i­nally ini­ti­ated by the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion, has faced a push­back from US labour and en­vi­ron­men­tal groups. Mr Bi­den has also stated that his ad­min­is­tra­tion will not ne­go­ti­ate new deals with­out hav­ing labour and en­vi­ron­men­tal lead­ers at the ta­ble. So coun­tries should ex­pect more em­pha­sis on labour and en­vi­ron­men­tal stan­dards – which are also pri­or­i­ties for the EU. Thus, trade ar­range­ments fac­ing Asian economies will re­main in flux for the fore­see­able fu­ture, al­though some out­comes, such as RCEP and the re­vival of the WTO, will be pos­i­tive.</p>
