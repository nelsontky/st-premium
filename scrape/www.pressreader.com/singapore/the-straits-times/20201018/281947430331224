    <p>RPARIS • French po­lice have ar­rested nine peo­ple af­ter a sus­pected Is­lamist sym­pa­thiser be­headed a school teacher on the street of a Paris sub­urb in a shock­ing act that Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron said bore the hall­marks of “an Is­lamist ter­ror­ist at­tack”.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tors were try­ing to es­tab­lish whether the at­tacker, who was shot dead by po­lice, had acted alone or if he had ac­com­plices, po­lice sources say.</p>
    <p>The 18-year-old had ap­proached stu­dents in the street and asked them to point out his vic­tim, an­titer­ror­ist prose­cu­tor Jean-Fran­cois Ri­card re­vealed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Ri­card said the at­tacker, af­ter be­head­ing his­tory teacher Sa­muel Paty, 47, posted a pho­to­graph of the man’s body on Twit­ter, ac­com­pa­nied by a mes­sage say­ing he had car­ried out the killing.</p>
    <p>Wit­nesses heard the as­sailant shout “Al­lahu Ak­bar”, or “God is great­est”, a po­lice source said. His vic­tim had this month shown stu­dents car­toons of Prophet Muham­mad in a civics class on free­dom of ex­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>Four rel­a­tives of the at­tacker, in­clud­ing a mi­nor, were de­tained in the i mme­di­ate hours af­ter the Fri­day at­tack in the mid­dle-class sub­urb of Con­flans-Sainte-Hon­orine, the sources said.</p>
    <p>Five more were later de­tained, among them t wo par­ents of stu­dents at the Col­lege du Bois d’Aulne, where the teacher was em­ployed.</p>
    <p>France will re­act with the great­est firm­ness over the at­tack, Prime Min­is­ter Jean Cas­tex said yes­ter­day. “Through one of its de­fend­ers, it is the Repub­lic which has been struck i n the heart by Is­lamist ter­ror­ism,” he wrote on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>“In sol­i­dar­ity with its teach­ers, the State will re­act with the great­est firm­ness so that the Repub­lic and its ci­ti­zens live, free! We will never give up. Never.”</p>
    <p>The pre­vi­ous day, speak­ing near the scene where the teacher was de­cap­i­tated, a vis­i­bly moved Mr Macron said “the en­tire na­tion” stands ready to de­fend teach­ers and that “ob­scu­ran­tism will not win”.</p>
    <p>The at­tack took place late on Fri­day af­ter­noon near the mid­dle school where the teacher worked in Con­flans-Sainte-Hon­orine, a north</p>
    <p>Ev­ery day that passes without in­ci­dent we give thanks. We are be­tween ham­mer and anvil. It at­tacks the Repub­lic, so­ci­ety, peace and the very essence of re­li­gion, which is about to­geth­er­ness.</p>
    <p>MR TAREQ OUBROU, imam of a mosque in Bordeaux, who dis­agreed with sug­ges­tions that the killing marked a clash of civil­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>western sub­urb around 30km from cen­tral Paris.</p>
    <p>Po­lice ar­rived at the scene af­ter re­ceiv­ing a call about a sus­pi­cious in­di­vid­ual loi­ter­ing near the school, a po­lice source said.</p>
    <p>They dis­cov­ered the dead teacher and soon spot­ted the sus­pect, armed with a blade, who threat­ened the of­fi­cers as they tried to ar­rest him. They opened fire and he later died of his in­juries.</p>
    <p>Iden­ti­fi­ca­tion doc­u­ments found on the sus­pect showed he was an 18-year-old born in Moscow but from Rus­sia’s south­ern re­gion of Chech­nya.</p>
    <p>The his­tory teacher’s re­cent class dis­cus­sion on free­dom of ex­pres­sion, dur­ing which he showed his stu­dents car­toons of Prophet Muham­mad, had prompted com­plaints from some par­ents.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a source, the two de­tained par­ents had sig­nalled their dis­agree­ment with the teacher’s de­ci­sion to show the car­toons.</p>
    <p>Mus­lim lead­ers have con­demned the killing, which many pub­lic fig­ures per­ceived as an at­tack on the essence of French state­hood and its val­ues of sec­u­lar­ism, free­dom of wor­ship and free­dom of ex­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>Mr Tareq Oubrou, the imam of a Bordeaux mosque, de­nied that the killing marked a clash of civil­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>“It is not a civil­i­sa­tion that kills an in­no­cent per­son – it is bar­bar­ity,” he told France In­ter, adding that the litany of deadly at­tacks by Is­lamist mil­i­tants or their sym­pa­this­ers was dev­as­tat­ing for France’s Mus­lim com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery day that passes without in­ci­dent we give thanks,” he said. “We are be­tween ham­mer and anvil. It at­tacks the Repub­lic, so­ci­ety, peace and the very essence of re­li­gion, which is about to­geth­er­ness.”</p>
    <p>At the school, par­ents and teach­ers paid trib­ute to the vic­tim.</p>
    <p>“Ac­cord­ing to my son, he was su­per nice, su­per friendly, su­per kind,” said Mr Nor­dine Chaouadi, a par­ent, adding that his son said the teacher had “sim­ply said to the Mus­lim chil­dren, ‘Leave, I don’t want it to hurt your feel­ings.’”</p>
    <p>The at­tack came as a trial is in progress over the Jan­uary 2015 mas­sacre at the of­fices of the Char­lie Hebdo satir­i­cal magazine, which had pub­lished car­i­ca­tures of the Prophet that un­leashed a wave of anger across the Is­lamic world.</p>
    <p>The magazine had de­fi­antly re­pub­lished the car­toons in the runup to the trial’s open­ing last month.</p>
    <p>In the same month, a young Pak­istani wounded two peo­ple with a meat cleaver out­side the magazine’s former of­fices.</p>
