    <p>Pa­tients at some nurs­ing homes here can soon have bet­ter wound treat­ment, thanks to an ini­tia­tive by St Luke’s Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>The hos­pi­tal said last Thurs­day that it has re­ceived a $1.5 mil­lion grant from the Lew Foun­da­tion to set up the Lew Foun­da­tion Community Wound Hub.</p>
    <p>The grant, to be dis­bursed over three years, will be used by the hos­pi­tal to ex­tend its wound care ex­per­tise to the community, in­clud­ing staff at nurs­ing homes and care­givers, and fund wound care re­search.</p>
    <p>An­nu­ally, about 150,000 pa­tients in Sin­ga­pore suf­fer chronic wounds – de­fined as wounds that take over a month to heal.</p>
    <p>The chief ex­ec­u­tive of St Luke’s Hos­pi­tal, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Tan Boon Yeow, said many of the pa­tients are el­derly, and their wounds take longer to heal due to age, poor blood sup­ply or chronic ill­nesses.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers have pres­sure in­juries like bed sores or skin tears due to the pro­longed time spent in bed.</p>
    <p>The community hos­pi­tal, lo­cated in Bukit Ba­tok, caters mainly to el­derly pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Ms Yvonne Lau, as­sis­tant di­rec­tor of St Luke’s community wound cen­tre, said: “Poor wound man­age­ment can lead to in­creased phys­i­cal, psy­cho­log­i­cal, emo­tional and fi­nan­cial costs.”</p>
    <p>St Luke’s new wound hub is an ex­ten­sion of the hos­pi­tal’s community wound cen­tre, which was for­malised in 2016. No new phys­i­cal in­fra­struc­ture will be built for the hub, which fo­cuses on ed­u­ca­tion and re­search.</p>
    <p>The hos­pi­tal has im­proved its wound care com­pe­tency over the years, and its in­ter­me­di­ate wound man­age­ment course is ac­cred­ited by the Euro­pean Wound Man­age­ment As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>It has also hosted 13 wound care con­fer­ences.</p>
    <p>Through the grant, St Luke’s aims to teach nurses in about 20 nurs­ing homes about wound care tech­niques and share best prac­tices.</p>
    <p>The train­ing will let pa­tients with chronic wounds be bet­ter treated on site, rather than be re-ad­mit­ted to community or acute hospi­tals if their con­di­tions do not im­prove.</p>
    <p>The col­lab­o­ra­tion with nurs­ing homes will see wound clin­i­cians from St Luke’s train staff from nurs­ing homes like St An­drew’s Nurs­ing Home (Ta­man Jurong), whose nurses started re­ceiv­ing on-the-job train­ing from St Luke’s staff in June.</p>
    <p>With the grant, St Luke’s will also test new wound treat­ment prod­ucts and tech­niques, po­ten­tially al­low­ing pa­tients to re­ceive wound treat­ment that they would oth­er­wise have to re­ceive at acute hospi­tals.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo Puay Hin, Lew Foun­da­tion’s di­rec­tor, said: “We hope that the hub will help re­duce the num­ber of am­pu­ta­tion cases, and that those with wounds can re­cover and be dis­charged ear­lier, and that they will be free of pain as much as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“We also hope to make life eas­ier for the peo­ple who care for them through ed­u­ca­tion and wound care tech­nolo­gies.”</p>
