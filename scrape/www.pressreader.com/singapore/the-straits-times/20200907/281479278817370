    <p>Ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) has not taken over the world yet, but for­mer en­gi­neer Zack Wong is pre­par­ing him­self for this brave new fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, 43, re­cently did a tech im­mer­sion course at Repub­lic Polytech­nic to pick up AI skills. He has also learnt pro­gram­ming and cod­ing.</p>
    <p>This is a far cry from how he started his ca­reer – work­ing as an en­gi­neer deal­ing with the re­pair devel­op­ment of air­craft en­gine com­po­nents.</p>
    <p>He then switched to sup­ply chain op­er­a­tions within the same in­dus­try and over­saw the co­or­di­na­tion of ma­te­rial sup­ply be­tween the op­er­a­tions, in­ven­tory and pur­chas­ing de­part­ments.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong left that be­hind to branch out into pho­tog­ra­phy at a bou­tique cre­ative agency. He pro­duced im­ages that were used in ed­i­to­ri­als, com­mer­cials and ad­ver­tise­ments.</p>
    <p>But both the cre­ative in­dus­try and his old avi­a­tion sec­tor were hit by the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“The Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion has... forced many to look for other jobs to sus­tain (them­selves). I was just one of the many. I was look­ing to re­turn to the aero­space in­dus­try but it was also go­ing down due to the cut in flights and lock­downs,” Mr Wong told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“I wanted to up­grade and reskill my­self with new knowl­edge in the grow­ing in­dus­try of AI. With the down­scal­ing of my com­pany and the loss of projects, I found my­self at a cross­roads – whether to con­tinue to be a res­i­dent pho­tog­ra­pher or up­grade with new skills, es­pe­cially in this dig­i­tal era of cloud and AI.”</p>
    <p>Mr Wong hopes that these skills will help him ful­fil his long-term plan of work­ing in the dig­i­tal field, par­tic­u­larly in re­la­tion to com­puter vi­sion and imag­ing, al­though he ac­knowl­edged there will be chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>“It is es­pe­cially dif­fi­cult for mid­ca­reer switch­ers like me, es­pe­cially when we have only less than three months of ex­pe­ri­ence and knowl­edge, and com­pa­nies are re­luc­tant to give us op­por­tu­ni­ties,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I have at­tended quite a few cour­ses and we­bi­nars as well in or­der to keep my­self up­dated on the cur­rent job mar­ket re­quire­ments.”</p>
