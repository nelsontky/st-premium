    <p>The worst is not over yet for Sin­ga­pore’s labour mar­ket, ex­perts said yes­ter­day in re­sponse to the lat­est data on it for the sec­ond quar­ter of the year.</p>
    <p>They pointed to the ta­per­ing of wage sub­si­dies, lack of de­mand and pro­longed un­cer­tain­ties as rea­sons for ex­pect­ing re­trench­ments to con­tinue and unemployme­nt to climb fur­ther for the rest of this year.</p>
    <p>The head­line sea­son­ally ad­justed unemployme­nt rate, which in­cludes for­eign­ers, rose to 3 per cent in July, while the rate for res­i­dents – Sin­ga­pore­ans and permanent res­i­dents – rose to 4.1 per cent, said the Min­istry of Man­power yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank’s head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy Se­lena Ling ex­pects the head­line rate to rise to 3.5 per cent in the sec­ond half of the year, while May­bank Kim Eng se­nior economist Chua Hak Bin ex­pects it to peak at slightly above 4 per cent.</p>
    <p>DBS Bank se­nior economist Irvin Seah ex­pects the over­all rate to rise to 3.6 per cent, with the res­i­dent rate hitting 4.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ms Ling said some com­pa­nies are start­ing to bite the bul­let and recog­nise that cer­tain in­dus­tries like avi­a­tion and hospi­tal­ity will take months if not years to re­cover.</p>
    <p>“The num­ber of work­ers on short work week or tem­po­rary lay­off may fall in the com­ing months or quar­ters, but that’s likely to be due to a com­bi­na­tion of other sec­tors re­turn­ing to more nor­malised lev­els of ac­tiv­ity com­bined with some com­pa­nies tak­ing the tough de­ci­sion to lay off rather than keep work­ers in cold stor­age for a much longer pe­riod,” she said.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Trades Union Congress as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Pa­trick Tay said in a Face­book post that the im­pact of re­trench­ments may not be fully seen yet, as re­trench­ment fig­ures re­ported do not in­clude older work­ers who were not re-em­ployed, for­eign­ers whose work passes are not re­newed and work­ers who may have left their jobs as their em­ploy­ers are fac­ing im­pend­ing liq­ui­da­tion or in­sol­vency.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, the fig­ure has hit 8,130 in the sec­ond quar­ter, the high­est level since the 2009 global fi­nan­cial crisis.</p>
    <p>Lower-skilled work­ers have been dis­pro­por­tion­ately af­fected by re­trench­ments among lo­cals so far, but DBS’ Mr Seah ex­pects the im­pact to broaden to pro­fes­sion­als as big­ger firms have to de­cide whether to re­struc­ture their busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>He added that the fi­nan­cial sec­tor, which has been largely shielded from the im­pact of the crisis so far, will be af­fected if the re­ces­sion­ary cy­cle drags on, es­pe­cially when the cor­po­rate loan mora­to­rium ex­pires some time next year and if non-per­form­ing loans and prop­erty loan de­faults start to pick up.</p>
    <p>May­bank Kim Eng’s Mr Chua said the large num­ber of work­ers on a shorter work week and tem­po­rary lay­off – 81,720 – is wor­ry­ing and sug­gests that lay­offs will likely con­tinue with the ta­per­ing of wage sub­si­dies.</p>
    <p>“Firms de­fer­ring lay­offs may have to face the re­al­ity of a pro­longed de­mand slump and right­size their man­power needs. These will likely in­clude the more dis­tressed sec­tors, in­clud­ing the travel, hospi­tal­ity, re­tail and recre­ational sec­tors,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts agreed that broad-based gov­ern­ment mea­sures sup­port­ing employment can­not con­tinue in­def­i­nitely, and the focus will have to shift.</p>
    <p>Ms Ling said the focus ahead may be more on train­ing and tran­sit­ing work­ers from gov­ern­ment-funded op­por­tu­ni­ties or jobs of­fered by pub­lic sec­tor agen­cies, to the longterm job of­fer­ings of pri­vate sec­tor em­ploy­ers, to avoid any struc­tural unemployme­nt prob­lems down the road.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion chief ex­ec­u­tive Ho Meng Kit said what is needed is bet­ter out­reach of sup­port schemes to busi­nesses so that com­pa­nies un­der­stand them and make use of them.</p>
    <p>He added that both busi­nesses and work­ers have to ad­just.</p>
    <p>“Com­pa­nies, for ex­am­ple, have to re­design jobs to fit the current employment pro­file and help work­ers up­skill dur­ing this pe­riod to acquire new ca­pa­bil­i­ties. Work­ers should stay nim­ble and be will­ing to adapt, and take up roles in sec­tors to re­main rel­e­vant and com­pet­i­tive,” he said.</p>
