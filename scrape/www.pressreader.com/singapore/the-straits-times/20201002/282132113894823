    <p>Sin­ga­pore kept its po­si­tion as the sec­ond most dig­i­tally com­pet­i­tive in the world, af­ter the United States, in the lat­est edi­tion of the IMD World Dig­i­tal Com­pet­i­tive­ness Rank­ing.</p>
    <p>Round­ing out the top five are Den­mark, Swe­den and Hong Kong, ac­cord­ing to the Swiss busi­ness school In­sti­tute for Man­age­ment De­vel­op­ment (IMD). The rank­ing, which is in its fourth year, mea­sures the ca­pac­ity of 63 na­tions and economies to use dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies as a driver for eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion in busi­ness, govern­ment and wider so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Three main fac­tors were used to as­sess dig­i­tal com­pet­i­tive­ness: knowl­edge, which mea­sures the ca­pac­ity to un­der­stand and build new tech­nolo­gies; tech­nol­ogy, which eval­u­ates the abil­ity to de­velop new dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies; and fu­ture readi­ness, which as­sesses pre­pared­ness to ex­ploit dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>This year’s sur­vey was car­ried out from Fe­bru­ary to May, dur­ing the peak of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>This meant that the re­sults were coloured by the pan­demic, which has in­creased de­pen­dence on dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Ar­turo Bris, di­rec­tor of the IMD World Com­pet­i­tive­ness Cen­tre, said: “The post-Covid-19 world will be char­ac­terised by a K-shaped re­cov­ery, with two types of economies: those that will re­cover quickly and those that will re­cover more slowly.</p>
    <p>“Re­cov­ery is driven by many fac­tors, such as the health of pub­lic fi­nances. But also, fun­da­men­tally, by the dig­i­tal com­pet­i­tive­ness of those economies.”</p>
    <p>All the top per­form­ers are adept at us­ing dig­i­tal tal­ent ef­fi­ciently, have ef­fec­tive reg­u­la­tion frame­works and are quick at adopt­ing new tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>This year’s anal­y­sis in­cluded a new cri­te­rion of “en­tre­pre­neur­ial fear of fail­ure”, which mea­sures the per­cent­age of 18- to 64-year-olds held back from start­ing a busi­ness by fear of fail­ure.</p>
    <p>The US, which main­tained its top spot for a third con­sec­u­tive year, per­formed well in ed­u­ca­tion, and re­search and de­vel­op­ment. It also led the rank­ings for the third year in e-par­tic­i­pa­tion from ci­ti­zens.</p>
    <p>Like in the pre­vi­ous edi­tion, Sin­ga­pore ex­celled in the knowl­edge and tech­nol­ogy fac­tors, where it ranked sec­ond and first, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>It also improved greatly in em­ployee train­ing, where it jumped 12 places to rank 16th.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Repub­lic con­tin­ued to trail in the rank­ings for fu­ture readi­ness – 12th com­pared with 11th last year – due to lower adap­tiv­ity to tech­no­log­i­cal change and a drop in busi­ness agility.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong moved up three spots to fifth in the over­all rank­ing, while South Korea rose two spots to fin­ish eighth.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore had, in June, re­tained its top spot as the world’s most com­pet­i­tive econ­omy in the lat­est edi­tion of the IMD World Com­pet­i­tive­ness Rank­ing, a sur­vey of 63 economies that analy­ses their abil­ity to gen­er­ate pros­per­ity.</p>
