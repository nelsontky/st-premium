    <p>For years, Euro­peans have been try­ing to com­part­men­talise their pol­icy to­wards China. Con­tentious is­sues such as trade, 5G,</p>
    <p>Hong Kong or the South China Sea were treated as in­di­vid­ual cases to avoid giv­ing a blan­ket re­sponse to the China chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>This, how­ever, could be­come a thing of the past.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing his re­cent trip to five Euro­pean cap­i­tals, China’s For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi was met with un­veiled scep­ti­cism – which was not the only in­di­ca­tion that the winds have changed.</p>
    <p>The mes­sage the Chi­nese emis­sary wanted to con­vey was quite clear: Bei­jing wants to present it­self as the bet­ter part­ner than Wash­ing­ton, and Mr Wang made a num­ber of over­tures in this re­gard.</p>
    <p>He ad­vo­cated more co­op­er­a­tion in the ar­eas of health, cli­mate change and the 5G net­work. He also said China wanted bet­ter, more sta­ble and more ma­ture re­la­tions with the Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>The re­sponse from Ger­man For­eign Min­is­ter Heiko Maas was rather cool: he called out Bei­jing on its new na­tional se­cu­rity leg­is­la­tion for Hong Kong and hu­man rights vi­o­la­tions in China’s north-west­ern re­gion of Xin­jiang.</p>
    <p>With re­gard to Hong Kong, Mr Maas made clear that Ger­many and the EU were stick­ing to the “one coun­try, two sys­tems” prin­ci­ple. He fur­ther asked China to grant a</p>
    <p>UN ob­server mis­sion ac­cess to the so-called reed­u­ca­tion camps.</p>
    <p>In a show of clos­ing of ranks in Europe, Mr Maas also stressed that China’s threats against the Czech Repub­lic would not be tol­er­ated. He was re­fer­ring to Mr Wang’s state­ment about a trip to Tai­wan by a top Czech par­lia­men­tar­ian.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang had said that Czech Se­nate Speaker Mi­los Vys­tr­cil would “pay a heavy price” for vis­it­ing Tai­wan. In Ber­lin, Mr Maas un­am­bigu­ously told his Chi­nese coun­ter­part that the EU val­ues close co­op­er­a­tion in for­eign pol­icy</p>
    <p>and treats its part­ners with re­spect: “We will no longer ac­cept threats against this com­mit­ment.”</p>
    <p>His state­ments left no doubt that the EU will not al­low it­self to be di­vided. Too many bur­dens have built up in the past. While China is vol­ubly ad­vo­cat­ing free trade and mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism, the re­al­ity on the ground is dif­fer­ent as it de­lays open­ing its mar­ket to Europe.</p>
    <p>“If you want to main­tain re­la­tions with Europe, you should at least make an of­fer to move to­wards the EU on one of the con­tentious points,” po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst Shi</p>
    <p>Yin­hong of Ren­min Univer­sity in Bei­jing told the Ger­man daily Frank­furter All­ge­meine Zeitung, not­ing that Mr Wang made only “gen­eral state­ments” and “no con­crete con­ces­sions”.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, Euro­pean na­tions do not want to be co­erced into choos­ing be­tween China and the United States, thus swop­ping one depen­dency for an­other.</p>
    <p>This shift of tone comes at a cru­cial mo­ment: On Sept 14, Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel, EU Com­mis­sion pres­i­dent Ur­sula von der Leyen and Euro­pean</p>
    <p>Coun­cil pres­i­dent Charles Michel will meet China’s Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping for a highly an­tic­i­pated EU-China video sum­mit.</p>
    <p>Mr Maas’ as­sess­ment of the EU-China re­la­tion­ship was echoed by Mr Josep Bor­rell, the EU’s high rep­re­sen­ta­tive and its for­eign pol­icy chief. In an ar­ti­cle for the Spanish jour­nal Po­lit­ica Ex­te­rior, he noted a sub­stan­tive change in the at­ti­tude of Bei­jing’s lead­er­ship. Mr Bor­rell, who de­scribed China as as­sertive, ex­pan­sion­ist and au­thor­i­tar­ian, wrote: “Our re­la­tion­ship is ex­ces­sively asym­met­ric for the cur­rent level of Chi­nese de­vel­op­ment. And that must be cor­rected.</p>
    <p>“If we don’t do it now, in a few years, it will be too late.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese prod­ucts will con­tinue to move up the value chain and our eco­nomic and tech­no­log­i­cal de­pen­dence will in­crease.” This was the most pointed lan­guage so far from a top EU of­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>Mr Bor­rell con­tin­ued: “Gone is Chi­nese for­eign pol­icy in­spired by Deng Xiaop­ing’s 1974 speech to the UN Gen­eral Assem­bly, where he stated that ‘China is not a su­per­power, nor will it ever seek to be’.”</p>
    <p>Now, how­ever, China’s ob­jec­tive is “the trans­for­ma­tion of the in­ter­na­tional or­der to­wards a se­lec­tive mul­ti­lat­eral sys­tem with Chi­nese char­ac­ter­is­tics, in which eco­nomic and so­cial rights are pri­ori­tised over po­lit­i­cal and civil rights”, he said.</p>
    <p>Last week, Ger­many sig­nalled that it was ready to ex­plore new geopo­lit­i­cal op­tions.</p>
    <p>The Cab­i­net adopted a set of guide­lines on how to shape fu­ture re­la­tion­ships with coun­tries such as In­dia, Japan and Aus­tralia, with the aim of strengthen­ing the rule of law and hu­man rights and to en­hance ex­changes in the cul­tural, ed­u­ca­tional and sci­en­tific spheres.</p>
    <p>Eco­nomic re­la­tions also are to be ex­panded, for ex­am­ple, through the conclusion of EU free trade agree­ments. “The aim must also be to avoid uni­lat­eral de­pen­den­cies by di­ver­si­fy­ing part­ner­ships,” the Cab­i­net said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Maas had also said: “Our pros­per­ity and our geopo­lit­i­cal in­flu­ence in the com­ing decades will de­pend not least on how we work to­gether with the coun­tries of the Indo-Pa­cific re­gion. That, more than any­where else, is where the shape of the in­ter­na­tional or­der of to­mor­row will be de­cided.”</p>
