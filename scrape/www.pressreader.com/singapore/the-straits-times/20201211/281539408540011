    <p>With more parks be­ing planned around Sin­ga­pore, the lit­tle red dot is fast trans­form­ing into a green habi­tat, and is on its way to be­com­ing a “City in Na­ture”. A love for na­ture can spark a love for nation, and lov­ing the is­land’s flora and fauna can form the heart of a Sin­ga­pore iden­tity, says as­so­ciate edi­tor Chua Mui Hoong.</p>
    <p>With more parks be­ing planned around Sin­ga­pore, the lit­tle red dot is fast trans­form­ing into a green habi­tat, a city with stretches of parks that breathe like a green lung through the con­crete land­scape.</p>
    <p>Some days, when I drive down leafy, tree-lined roads around the Cen­tral Catch­ment area – like the Lornie Road high­way – I feel like I’m al­ready liv­ing in a “City in Na­ture”. This is the vi­sion Sin­ga­pore is aim­ing for, a reimag­i­na­tion of its for­mer “Gar­den City” and “City in a Gar­den” con­cepts.</p>
    <p>Mov­ing from the idea of “gar­den” to “na­ture” de­notes a shift from cul­ti­va­tion and prun­ing to con­ser­va­tion and pro­tec­tion. One was about con­trol and shap­ing; the other is about con­serv­ing and nur­tur­ing. (That move­ment can be a metaphor for how Sin­ga­pore should de­velop so­ciopo­lit­i­cally, but that is another story.)</p>
    <p>As Na­tional Devel­op­ment Min­is­ter Des­mond Lee said on Mon­day, when he an­nounced plans for a se­ries of parks around Bukit Ba­tok: “These act as buf­fers to pro­tect our cen­tral na­ture re­serves, which are some of the rich­est sources of our nat­u­ral cap­i­tal, and we pro­tect them against the im­pact of ur­ban­i­sa­tion. They also serve as com­ple­men­tary habi­tats to al­low our na­tive flora and fauna to thrive, and for Sin­ga­pore­ans to go out and about to en­joy.</p>
    <p>“As we trans­form Sin­ga­pore into a City in Na­ture, we will con­tinue to en­hance and ex­tend our nat­u­ral cap­i­tal across our is­land from our re­serves. To do so, we will add another 200ha of na­ture parks, 190km of na­ture ways and 160km of park con­nec­tors is­land­wide by 2030.”</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Parks Board (NParks) has been do­ing a great job con­struct­ing, con­vert­ing and con­serv­ing our parks and na­ture re­serves.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee’s speech de­scrib­ing the na­ture re­serves as part of the nation’s “nat­u­ral cap­i­tal” is wel­come for its im­plicit prom­ise to con­serve such re­serves and to pro­tect them for fu­ture gen­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>But na­ture can pro­vide much more than a source of cap­i­tal. As more at­ten­tion, space and re­sources are de­voted to na­ture in Sin­ga­pore, there is an op­por­tu­nity here for na­ture to oc­cupy a place, front and cen­tre, in our hearts and minds, to an­chor our sense of what be­ing Singaporea­n means and what Sin­ga­pore is.</p>
    <p>Love of na­ture can form the vi­tal, throb­bing heart of what it means to be Singaporea­n.</p>
    <p>LOVE AF­FAIR WITH NA­TURE</p>
    <p>Like many Sin­ga­pore­ans of my gen­er­a­tion, I grew up in a con­crete jun­gle. But a love of lit­er­a­ture and na­ture po­etry stirred my aes­thetic sense. On stud­ies and trav­els over­seas, I learnt to ap­pre­ci­ate land­scapes, wildlife and na­ture parks. When I came home after my stud­ies and dis­cov­ered the MacRitchie na­ture trails, I came to ap­pre­ci­ate our small is­land with its densely packed bio­di­ver­sity. Thus be­gan what I hope will be a life­long af­fair with Sin­ga­pore’s na­ture mar­vels.</p>
    <p>These days, when I get into a Wordswor­thian reverie, it is no longer fields of daf­fodils I dream about, but the im­ages of wildlife en­coun­ters here and on trav­els that I play out in my mind.</p>
    <p>The times my binoc­u­lars are trained on a heron at the pre­cise mo­ment it darts to catch a fish. The flash of blue as a brave king­fisher flies after a mon­i­tor lizard mul­ti­ple times its size, which is in turn chas­ing a frog – and all three dis­ap­pear­ing in tan­dem into a dark canal. The bril­liant or­ange of a wild orang utan nestling her baby, perched on a tree on the bank of the Kin­abatan­gan River in Sabah. Na­ture in­spires lit­er­a­ture.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal writ­ers eu­lo­gise and en­gage with Sin­ga­pore’s na­ture scenes. The de­light­ful NParks pub­li­ca­tion The Na­ture Of Po­etry (edited by Ed­win Thum­boo and Eric Tin­say Valles) has lo­cal po­ets writ­ing about lo­cal parks from whim­si­cal per­spec­tives, such as this de­scrip­tion of hard-work­ing tree saplings that blurt</p>
    <p>“Fresh cir­cu­lars from every limb Last work year closed, they chant their hymn:</p>
    <p>Re­fresh, reset, re­vert, re­vert.” (Joshua Ip, The Trees)</p>
    <p>To­day, many Sin­ga­pore­ans share their love of na­ture in de­tailed, close-up pho­to­graphs and in­for­ma­tive posts, on Face­book groups like Na­ture So­ci­ety (Sin­ga­pore), Sin­ga­pore Bird­ers, and Sin­ga­pore Wildlife Ad­ven­tures.</p>
    <p>In the last two months, a group of na­ture en­thu­si­asts has started a cam­paign to pro­tect Cle­menti For­est, a stretch of land near King Al­bert Park, shar­ing stun­ning pho­tos and drone-pow­ered videos of its lush green­ery, get­ting Sin­ga­pore­ans to sign a pe­ti­tion to lobby the Gov­ern­ment to safe­guard it from devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Such love for na­ture can be a source of na­tional pride and strength.</p>
    <p>LOVE OF NA­TURE AND LOVE OF NATION</p>
    <p>When we love what we find on our home ground, we learn to love our home more deeply.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren can be taught to ap­pre­ci­ate na­ture via fre­quent out­ings to our parks, and taught to name and iden­tify species such as the 10 most com­mon trees, shrubs, birds, fish, rep­tiles and in­sects in our nat­u­ral habi­tats. Be­ing able to name our own flora and fauna is a crit­i­cal first step to fos­ter­ing a sense of be­long­ing to the land, and re­spon­si­bil­ity to pro­tect it.</p>
    <p>An on­go­ing ex­hi­bi­tion at the Na­tional Mu­seum, Story Of The For­est, trans­forms 69 draw­ings from the Wil­liam Far­quhar Col­lec­tion of Nat­u­ral His­tory Draw­ings into three-di­men­sional an­i­ma­tions. It’s on my to-see list soon.</p>
    <p>Na­ture an­chors our love of the nation state in deeper roots than that pro­vided by our short 55-year his­tory as a sov­er­eign coun­try. When we love na­ture, we adopt a long-term per­spec­tive as we strive to be good stew­ards of these pre­cious re­serves for fu­ture gen­er­a­tions. We know there’s just us; if we fail, our chil­dren and grand­chil­dren can tear down the sky­scrapers we built, but they can­not grow back the forests. At least not for a hun­dred years or so.</p>
    <p>One con­so­la­tion is that we are do­ing bet­ter to­day than in the past. In the 1980s, our land mass had 36 per cent green cover. To­day, 56 per cent is cov­ered in veg­e­ta­tion. As a coun­try, we are learn­ing to cher­ish what is left of our nat­u­ral her­itage and to as­sid­u­ously con­serve and re­grow it.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is home to more than 390 species of birds and at least 2,100 species of na­tive vas­cu­lar plants. It has more plant and tree species than the en­tire North Amer­i­can con­ti­nent. From these, we in­ter­nalise that small is beau­ti­ful, size does not equal sig­nif­i­cance, and qual­ity of at­ten­tion and in­ten­sity of ef­fort mat­ter in how well we do some­thing. We re­solve that con­serv­ing and cul­ti­vat­ing this tiny sand­bank in the sea is worth it, be­cause it is our only home.</p>
    <p>When we learn the ori­gins of some of our much-loved flora and fauna, we may re­think what be­ing na­tive means. Many Sin­ga­pore­ans love the rain tree for its ma­jes­tic shape and green cover – not many know it is not na­tive, but is an in­tro­duced species of Al­bizia from trop­i­cal Amer­ica. The rub­ber in­dus­try so preva­lent through­out Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia in the mid-20th cen­tury had been seeded – lit­er­ally – from Lon­don’s Kew Gar­dens. On June 11, 1877, 22 seedlings ar­rived safely in Sin­ga­pore; of these, 11 were planted in the Sin­ga­pore Botanic Gar­dens, nine went to Perak and two to Me­laka.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s open­ness to the world is the lifeblood not only of its com­merce but also its nat­u­ral habi­tats. Just as Changi Air­port is a hub for avi­a­tion, so are Sin­ga­pore’s Mandai and Kranji mud­flats es­sen­tial grounds for mi­gra­tory birds, thou­sands of which win­ter here.</p>
    <p>We are closely linked to our re­gion: Con­struc­tion in Jo­hor wa­ters dis­rupts croc­o­diles’ hunt­ing grounds, send­ing them into Sin­ga­pore wa­ters. The dusky lan­gur, a mon­key na­tive to Malaysia, has been spot­ted in Sin­ga­pore since last year, first in Wood­lands and more re­cently in Thom­son.</p>
    <p>We are in­ter­con­nected, yet sep­a­rate. While open to an in­flux of wildlife, we have our own na­tive species. Horn­bills are found through­out Asia and in Africa, but the ori­en­tal pied horn­bill is na­tive here. There are dif­fer­ent species of mouse deer in the re­gion, but the lesser mouse deer is the most com­mon one in Sin­ga­pore and of­ten hangs around the Cen­tral Catch­ment area.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to ex­perts, more than 100 species new to science have been dis­cov­ered in Sin­ga­pore in re­cent years, “in­clud­ing new species of moss, fungi, lichens, fishes, ne­ma­todes, spi­ders, mites, har­vest­men, wasps, bee­tles, bugs, flies, shrimps, bar­na­cles, and crabs” (Sin­ga­pore Bio­di­ver­sity: An En­cy­clo­pe­dia Of The Nat­u­ral En­vi­ron­ment And Sus­tain­able Devel­op­ment, 2011, edited by</p>
    <p>P.K.L. Ng, R.T. Cor­lett, H.T.W. Tan).</p>
    <p>A Sin­ga­pore iden­tity rooted in na­ture can be an­chored on val­ues of stew­ard­ship, re­spon­si­bil­ity, open­ness and di­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>Then there is na­ture and pol­i­tics. Na­ture tran­scends race, re­li­gion, class and po­lit­i­cal lean­ings. At a time when na­tion­al­ism veers too quickly into xeno­pho­bia, and po­lit­i­cal po­lar­i­sa­tion threat­ens to rup­ture so­ci­eties, a love of nation based on a shared love of its nat­u­ral her­itage can be uni­fy­ing.</p>
    <p>An ap­pre­ci­a­tion of na­ture can also help us weather the volatil­ity of mod­ern life.</p>
    <p>In an age of un­cer­tainty, when agility and adapt­abil­ity are prized, na­ture teaches us that life is be­yond our con­trol. Each walk in na­ture is un­pre­dictable, sub­ject to the weather and to the whimsy of the crea­tures we hope to en­counter. No per­son, no mat­ter their wealth or power, can sum­mon wildlife to ap­pear at will. This teaches hu­mil­ity, pa­tience and adapt­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>When graced with an en­counter – a fleet­ing mo­ment when we see a crea­ture go about its busi­ness of hunt­ing, mat­ing, or groom­ing – we may re­spond with awe and won­der, with a sense of grat­i­tude and priv­i­lege at be­ing in the right place at the right time. Such emo­tions force us to see be­yond the ego, and give us a more bal­anced view of how the self re­lates to the world.</p>
    <p>Na­ture is also wild, and as dan­ger lurks (think of a wild boar or a crocodile cross­ing your path), we learn to be vig­i­lant where wildlife roam, to re­spect their space and ob­serve bound­aries.</p>
    <p>Adapt­abil­ity, pa­tience, re­spect­ing bound­aries – all these are good val­ues to help us nav­i­gate the com­plex­i­ties of an un­cer­tain world.</p>
    <p>But in the end, de­light­ing in na­ture is its own re­ward.</p>
    <p>It is an added bonus if it also in­stils love for our coun­try, helps bind us so we are more co­he­sive as a so­ci­ety, awak­ens our aes­thetic sense, and opens our eyes to live with more open­ness and adapt­abil­ity in our too-com­plex world.</p>
    <p>These days, when I get into a Wordswor­thian reverie, it is no longer fields of daf­fodils I dream about, but the im­ages of wildlife en­coun­ters here and on trav­els that I play out in my mind. The times my binoc­u­lars are trained on a heron at the pre­cise mo­ment it darts to catch a fish.
