    <p>•</p>
    <p>LOS ANGELES Ja­son Kokrak failed to win on the PGA Tour on 232 pre­vi­ous oc­ca­sions.</p>
    <p>He fi­nally suc­ceeded at the next time of ask­ing, beat­ing a stacked field in­clud­ing world No. 8 Xan­der Schauf­fele, three-time Tour winner Rus­sell Hen­ley, former world No. 1 Ja­son Day and ninth-ranked Tyrrell Hat­ton, com­ing off a victory at the BMW PGA Cham­pi­onship the pre­vi­ous week.</p>
    <p>Kokrak reeled off six birdies in a seven-hole stretch on Sun­day en route to win­ning the CJ Cup at Shadow Creek.</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old Amer­i­can fired a fi­nal round eight-un­der 64 to fin­ish 72 holes at the Las Vegas lay­out on 20-un­der 268 to de­feat com­pa­triot Schauf­fele (66) by two strokes, while Hat­ton (65) and Hen­ley (70) fin­ished a fur­ther shot be­hind.</p>
    <p>“Game plan was sim­ple – hit fair­ways,” Kokrak said. “Gave my­self more op­por­tu­ni­ties than I had the past cou­ple days and I took ad­van­tage of them.”</p>
    <p>The world No. 53 had come close to tast­ing victory be­fore as a three­time Tour run­ner-up – at the 2012 Frys.com Open, the 2016 North­ern Trust Open and the 2019 Valspar Cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>How­ever, hav­ing to go with­out a win since join­ing the PGA Tour 10 years ago left him deal­ing with “some scar tis­sue”.</p>
    <p>“If you’re not ner­vous, you’re not alive... I def­i­nitely had some nerves go­ing… but I knew in my own mind that I was go­ing to get it done, it was just a mat­ter of time of me get­ting out of my own way and let­ting it hap­pen,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause my game is right there with the best play­ers in the world and I just need to con­tinue to be­lieve so, and if the putting’s there for me, we’re go­ing to be right there in con­tention.</p>
    <p>“Fi­nally got it done. Couldn’t be hap­pier. I did a good job of hit­ting the spots we were putting to. I’m happy with my putting. All the work we’ve been putting in has paid off.”</p>
    <p>Kokrak made 14 putts from be­yond 10 feet for the week, his most in any Tour start, while Schauf­fele, who shared se­cond at last year’s Masters and last month’s Tour Cham­pi­onship, missed out on his fifth PGA ti­tle.</p>
    <p>At the par-three 17th, Schauf­fele holed a five-footer for par to stay one back of Kokrak head­ing to the par-five 18th.</p>
    <p>Years Ja­son Kokrak played on the PGA Tour be­fore his first win.</p>
    <p>It was a hole Schauf­fele had birdied in two of the three pre­vi­ous rounds but he missed a 10-foot birdie putt, while Kokrak twop­utted for birdie and the win.</p>
    <p>“It was a nice duel be­tween the two of us,” Kokrak said.</p>
    <p>“We brought out the best in each other.</p>
    <p>“It was very nice to come up 18 and have a one-shot lead. Xan­der’s a great player, he’s a proven Tour winner.</p>
    <p>“To so­lid­ify my first win here against a great player like that makes it a lit­tle more spe­cial.”</p>
    <p>The tour­na­ment, orig­i­nally based in South Korea, was moved to Las Vegas due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, while the Zozo Cham­pi­onship starts on Thurs­day, not in Ja­pan but in Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>There are no Asian-based Tour events this year – the WGC-HSBC Cham­pi­ons in Shang­hai has been axed – but all three events are ex­pected to re­turn to the con­ti­nent next year.</p>
    <p>Ja­son Kokrak con­quer­ing his nerves to shoot a solid 64 in the fi­nal round to avoid a fourth run­ner-up PGA Tour fin­ish in his ca­reer.</p>
