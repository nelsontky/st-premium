    <p>Hong Kong’s pub­lic health sys­tem is un­der se­vere strain as the num­ber of new coro­n­avirus cases in the fi­nan­cial hub topped 2,000 yes­ter­day. Hos­pi­tals have cut down on non-es­sen­tial ser­vices and surgery, with fa­cil­i­ties reach­ing max­i­mum ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>With Hong Kong pub­lic hos­pi­tals’ ca­pac­ity for treat­ing Covid-19 pa­tients al­ready over-stretched and test­ing fa­cil­i­ties swamped, this could turn out to be a cru­cial week for the pub­lic health sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Hos­pi­tals have moved to cut down on non-es­sen­tial ser­vices and surgery as Covid-19 cases crossed the 2,000 mark yes­ter­day, while two more people have died.</p>
    <p>The Hos­pi­tal Au­thor­ity’s chief man­ager for clus­ter per­for­mance, Mr Ian Che­ung Tsz Fung, warned yes­ter­day that 77 per cent of beds in iso­la­tion rooms are now oc­cu­pied by pa­tients in quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>This means local hos­pi­tals are reach­ing the 80 per cent thresh­old for treat­ing such pa­tients.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing 20 per cent is re­served for emer­gen­cies.</p>
    <p>Each day in the past week, about 50 Covid-19 pa­tients on av­er­age have been sent for quar­an­tine in hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing dur­ing an RTHK pro­gramme, Mr Che­ung said the prob­lem has been com­pounded by the fact that there are many el­derly pa­tients who suf­fer from chronic ill­nesses or re­quire hos­pi­tal stays.</p>
    <p>The health au­thor­i­ties, in a daily brief­ing later yes­ter­day, re­ported 61 new in­fec­tions, bring­ing the to­tal tally of con­firmed cases in the city to 2,019, in­clud­ing 14 deaths.</p>
    <p>Of the new cases, 58 were local, ex­tend­ing a trend that has alarmed of­fi­cials and health ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Test­ing fa­cil­i­ties and staff have been stretched, with the Cen­tre for Health Pro­tec­tion is­su­ing an apol­ogy early yes­ter­day for mix­ing up the test re­sults of two people.</p>
    <p>Dr Le­ung Chi Chiu of the Hong Kong Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion told The Straits Times that the key fac­tor now was to mo­bilise the com­mu­nity into stay­ing at home as much as pos­si­ble and as soon as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“Now is the time for the pri­vate sec­tor to fol­low the ex­am­ple of the govern­ment, to al­low most of their em­ploy­ees to work at home and also for all residents to stay home as much as pos­si­ble. This is the surest way of cut­ting the trans­mis­sion links,” Dr Le­ung said.</p>
    <p>He added that in do­ing so, the au­thor­i­ties could then trace key trans­mis­sion routes and stop the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>When it was pointed out to him that Hong Kong is a densely pop­u­lated city and many people share hous­ing units with oth­ers, he in­sisted that trans­mis­sion within a unit could be con­tained.</p>
    <p>Dr Le­ung said that as long as in­di­vid­u­als re­mained in their unit, it would be easy to de­tect and trace the source of in­fec­tions. He also called for the step­ping up of per­sonal hy­giene.</p>
    <p>“Even if there is trans­mis­sion within a sin­gle place, you can al­ways track them down very quickly,” said Dr Le­ung, who is chair­man of the as­so­ci­a­tion’s com­mu­ni­ca­ble diseases ad­vi­sory com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>Health ex­perts in the city have pointed to lax border con­trols for for­eign ar­rivals as one of the main rea­sons for the cur­rent wave of in­fec­tions, not­ing that quar­an­tine mea­sures had not been as tight in the past two months as they could have been.</p>
    <p>Govern­ment data showed that some 200,000 people re­ceived ex­emp­tions from the manda­tory 14-day quar­an­tine or tests be­tween Fe­bru­ary and May.</p>
    <p>They in­cluded air and sea crew, as well as those bring­ing food sup­plies into the city.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, in­com­ing air and ship crew were tested for the virus but not quar­an­tined.</p>
    <p>But Dr Le­ung re­mained con­fi­dent that the city would be able to come to grips with the prob­lem.</p>
    <p>“I’m sure that we will be able to con­tain the sit­u­a­tion within a mat­ter of weeks,” he said, adding that he be­lieves the city will be able to curb trans­mis­sions be­cause of the high per­cent­age of people who wear masks.</p>
