    <p>The con­se­quences of the tougher US stance to­wards Hong Kong, espe­cially the im­po­si­tion of sanc­tions on top of­fi­cials in the ter­ri­tory as well as from the main­land, are ex­ten­sive – with se­vere im­pli­ca­tions for fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions, both lo­cal and in­ter­na­tional, in the city.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause of the reach of the United States fi­nan­cial sys­tem, which cov­ers not only US-domi­ciled com­pa­nies or firms in­cor­po­rated in the US, but also any for­eign of­fice of a US-domi­ciled com­pany, a branch of a non-US bank in the US, as well as any US cor­re­spon­dent ac­count.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Nick Turner, a lawyer spe­cial­is­ing in sanc­tions and anti-money laun­der­ing at Step­toe and Johnson in Hong Kong: “The (bank) cus­tomer might think they are send­ing money di­rectly from Hong Kong to Sin­ga­pore or</p>
    <p>Hong Kong to Lon­don but in fact, they might be clear­ing it through the US and the cus­tomer re­ally has no con­trol over that.”</p>
    <p>The banks do it this way as most of them do not keep a lot of US dol­lars on hand, so it is cheaper for them to process US dol­lar through New York and more man­age­able for the lenders in­volved.</p>
    <p>Bloomberg yes­ter­day re­ported that China’s largest state-run banks op­er­at­ing in Hong Kong, in­clud­ing Bank of China and China Con­struc­tion Bank, are tak­ing ten­ta­tive steps to com­ply with the sanc­tions as they seek to safe­guard their ac­cess to cru­cial US dol­lar fund­ing and over­seas net­works.</p>
    <p>The re­port, cit­ing those fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter, also said at least one bank has sus­pended the open­ing of new ac­counts for the 11 sanc­tioned of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>Cit­i­group, among other lenders, has re­port­edly taken steps to sus­pend ac­counts and in­crease scru­tiny of Hong Kong clients.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam and Mr Xia Bao­long, head of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Of­fice, were among those sanc­tioned by Wash­ing­ton last Fri­day for “un­der­min­ing</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s au­ton­omy” in push­ing for a new na­tional se­cu­rity law im­posed by Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>“When some­one is put on the sanc­tions list and banks are no longer able to process the trans­ac­tions through New York, that means the lenders will have a re­ally hard time send­ing US dol­lar wire trans­fers to other coun­tries be­cause there are very few path­ways they can take that don’t in­volve the US,” Mr Turner said.</p>
    <p>An­other way, though lim­ited, is through Hong Kong’s Clear­ing House Au­to­mated Trans­fer Sys­tem, or Chats, that clears the US dol­lar do­mes­ti­cally and does not al­ways in­volve Amer­i­can banks. There are sim­i­lar plat­forms in China and many other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Aside from banks, bro­ker­ages, pay­ment pro­ces­sors like Pay­Pal and even US on­line mar­ket­places like Ama­zon might also have to re­ject trans­ac­tions in­volv­ing those on the sanc­tions list.</p>
    <p>“It’s not just the US fi­nan­cial sys­tem be­cause a lot of fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions in the world have re­ally strict sanc­tions pol­icy... Some of them do it for risk man­age­ment pur­poses so they just de­cline busi­ness from sanc­tioned peo­ple be­cause it’s eas­ier for them from a com­pli­ance per­spec­tive.</p>
    <p>“Some of them have con­trac­tual pro­vi­sions that say they won’t do busi­ness with sanc­tioned in­di­vid­u­als so even though it might not be a US com­pany they might have an in­ter­nal pol­icy against it,” said Mr Turner.</p>
    <p>Sec­re­tary for Jus­tice Teresa Cheng, who is among those sanc­tioned by Wash­ing­ton, is mar­ried to the chair­man of Ana­logue Hold­ings, an in­vest­ment com­pany.</p>
    <p>Her hus­band, Mr Otto Poon, said on Tues­day that Ana­logue had sold a 2 per cent stake in New York’s</p>
    <p>MORE DIF­FI­CUL­TIES When some­one is put on the sanc­tions list and banks are no longer able to process the trans­ac­tions through New York, that means the lenders will have a re­ally hard time send­ing US dol­lar wire trans­fers to other coun­tries be­cause there are very few path­ways they can take ’’ that don’t in­volve the US. MR NICK TURNER, a lawyer spe­cial­is­ing in sanc­tions and anti-money laun­der­ing at Step­toe and Johnson in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Transel El­e­va­tor & Elec­tric, so as to take its own­er­ship be­low 50 per cent. He said the de­ci­sion came af­ter con­sult­ing US le­gal coun­sel and due to “chang­ing Sino-US ten­sion”.</p>
    <p>Mr Sean King of US con­sul­tancy firm Park Strate­gies noted that an in­alien­able part of the US fi­nan­cial sys­tem is the green­back, which at the same time is the world’s re­serve currency.</p>
    <p>“Los­ing ac­cess to the US dol­lar and the US bank­ing sys­tem greatly com­pli­cates any en­tity’s, or any per­son’s, abil­ity to do busi­ness out­side their own mar­ket,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, an­other front could emerge as Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials are urg­ing the Pres­i­dent to delist Chi­nese com­pa­nies that trade on US ex­changes and fail to meet Amer­i­can au­dit­ing re­quire­ments by Jan­uary 2022.</p>
    <p>Main­land firms now dom­i­nate Hong Kong’s ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing mar­ket, ac­count­ing for 48 per cent of syn­di­cated lend­ing last year, up from about 28.5 per cent in 2015, ac­cord­ing to Mr Steve Vick­ers, a po­lit­i­cal and cor­po­rate risk con­sul­tancy spe­cial­ist.</p>
    <p>“Any re­turn of Chi­nese busi­nesses listed in the US to Hong Kong will only ac­cel­er­ate this shift, with ben­e­fits li­able to ac­crue to those com­pa­nies iden­ti­fied as po­lit­i­cally re­li­able,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that risks from large-scale shifts in the po­lit­i­cal, le­gal and com­mer­cial en­vi­ron­ment will quicken Hong Kong’s in­te­gra­tion into the Greater Bay Area, com­pris­ing Guang­dong, Hong Kong and Macau.</p>
