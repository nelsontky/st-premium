    <p>LON­DON • Liver­pool man­ager Jur­gen Klopp said pre­par­ing to face a youth­ful As­ton Villa team in Fri­day’s FA Cup third-round clash pre­sented a chal­lenge he had never faced be­fore, but the Ger­man was pleased to emerge with a 4-1 vic­tory at Villa Park.</p>
    <p>Villa were forced to field academy play­ers due to a mass Covid-19 out­break among their ranks, with Un­der-23 coach Mark De­laney tak­ing charge of the game in­stead of first-team man­ager Dean Smith.</p>
    <p>In all, 14 un­named Villa em­ploy­ees – nine play­ers and five staff – have tested pos­i­tive for the virus.</p>
    <p>Sa­dio Mane scored twice while Ge­orginio Wi­j­nal­dum and Mo­hamed Salah added one each to can­cel out a fine goal by Villa’s 17-year-old striker Louie Barry.</p>
    <p>“The kids of Villa did re­ally well,” Klopp said. “It was a tricky one. I’ve never be­fore had this kind of chal­lenge in my life, that you have no idea who you’re play­ing against. Ab­so­lutely no idea.</p>
    <p>“You pre­pare a meet­ing and then you can throw all the prepa­ra­tion, all the videos in the bin and then you have to start new. That’s foot­ball and academy play­ers are good play­ers.</p>
    <p>“Last year we played here with our kids and they gave Villa a proper game as well. Th­ese young kids can all play foot­ball and, if you don’t play well against them, you have prob­lems.”</p>
    <p>Six­teen Villa play­ers made their first-team de­buts on Fri­day – four of their start­ing line-up were not even born when Liver­pool’s James Mil­ner made his de­but for Leeds in 2002 – and De­laney said he was im­mensely proud of the char­ac­ter they had shown.</p>
    <p>“The char­ac­ter­is­tics of the boys, their to­geth­er­ness, the ca­ma­raderie be­tween the group, they pulled them­selves to­gether, they didn’t let it faze them,” he said.</p>
    <p>“You’ve got to take your hat off to them, they were out­stand­ing.”</p>
    <p>That Villa, whose team’s av­er­age age of 18 and 294 days, could end the night with their heads held high was all the more re­mark­able af­ter their CEO Chris­tian Purslow’s pre-match as­sess­ment.</p>
    <p>“Our ex­pe­ri­ence of this sit­u­a­tion in the past two days has been a fright­en­ing sce­nario be­cause we went from 100 per cent neg­a­tive on 1 Jan­uary to 14 cases,” Purslow told BT Sport. “Many of the play­ers tonight are so young their mums and dads will be drop­ping them off at Villa Park.”</p>
    <p>In the evening’s other fix­ture, Wolver­hamp­ton Wan­der­ers beat Crys­tal Palace 1-0 thanks to Adama Traore’s 35th-minute thun­der­bolt.</p>
    <p>There are grow­ing con­cerns over whether the Premier League sea­son can be com­pleted on time as the new virus vari­ant plagues Eng­land.</p>
    <p>The FA Cup has not es­caped the chaos and Southamp­ton’s thir­dround tie against Shrews­bury has been post­poned af­ter sev­eral pos­i­tive tests at the League One team.</p>
    <p>Derby’s first-team squad also missed their tie at Chor­ley yes­ter­day be­cause of an out­break.</p>
    <p>A record-high 40 pos­i­tive tests were de­tected among top-flight play­ers and staff be­tween Dec 28 and Jan 3, and four Premier League games have al­ready been post­poned this term.</p>
    <p>The English Foot­ball League, which over­sees the three di­vi­sions be­low the Premier League, re­ported 112 pos­i­tive tests on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>De­spite the resur­gent virus, Premier League of­fi­cials are adamant the sea­son will pro­ceed.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool next host Manch­ester United in a block­buster clash next Sun­day as they re­turn to Premier League ac­tion.</p>
    <p>16 As­ton Villa play­ers made first-team de­buts in the FA Cup third-round clash against Liver­pool.</p>
