    <p>MADRID • Spain coach Luis En­rique was taken in by the qual­ity he saw in teenage for­ward Ansu Fati, who be­came his coun­try’s youngest goalscorer by net­ting in a 4-0 win against Ukraine in the Uefa Na­tions League on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Fati, who turns 18 on Oct 31, turned in a sen­sa­tional all-round dis­play in his first start for Spain and struck his first goal for his coun­try to make it 3-0 in the 32nd minute with an ef­fort from out­side the area.</p>
    <p>“It’s not nor­mal for him to have this spark and self-con­fi­dence at this age. But we’ll try to man­age that so he can help the team as much as pos­si­ble,” En­rique said.</p>
    <p>Ser­gio Ramos had given Spain an early lead by con­vert­ing a penalty earned by Fati and the de­fender struck again with a header, while sub­sti­tute Fer­ran Tor­res rounded off an out­stand­ing team dis­play.</p>
    <p>The re­sult left the Spa­niards top of League A Group 4 with four points from two matches.</p>
    <p>Fati’s goal saw him break the late Juan Er­razquin’s record as Spain’s youngest goalscorer that had stood for 95 years. Er­razquin scored his first goal against Switzer­land in 1925 at 18 years and 344 days.</p>
    <p>Fati did not waste his time in mak­ing his mark on the game, win­ning a penalty af­ter burst­ing into the box from the left wing af­ter ef­fort­lessly nut­meg­ging an op­po­nent.</p>
    <p>“He showed such brav­ery and daring to do what he did in the sec­ond minute, beat­ing a player so nat­u­rally,” added En­rique.</p>
    <p>Fati, who was born in Guinea-Bis­sau but moved to Seville in Spain at age six, be­came Spain’s youngest player in 84 years when he made his de­but in last Thurs­day’s 1-1 draw away to Ger­many.</p>
    <p>He be­came Barcelona’s youngest goalscorer in La Liga last year with a goal against Osasuna and also be­came the youngest scorer in the his­tory of the Cham­pi­ons League by net­ting against In­ter Mi­lan in De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>While Spain clinched an easy win, Ilkay Gun­do­gan could not hide his an­noy­ance when Ger­many re­mained third in the same group af­ter Switzer­land fought back to earn a 1-1 draw on Sun­day in Basel.</p>
    <p>The mid­fielder gave Ger­many the lead on 14 min­utes only for Swiss right-back Sil­van Wid­mer to equalise just be­fore the hour mark.</p>
    <p>“This is get­ting on my nerves,” he ad­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>“We were in a good po­si­tion, but once more, we didn’t win. It’s very an­noy­ing.”</p>
