    <p>PARIS • France will, from to­day, en­force mask-wear­ing in en­closed pub­lic spa­ces, in­clud­ing banks, shops and in­door mar­kets, Health Min­is­ter Olivier Veran has said, as part of ef­forts to curb a resur­gence of Covid-19 across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has ac­cel­er­ated plans to make it com­pul­sory to wear masks after a series of in­di­ca­tors sug­gested the virus could be gain­ing mo­men­tum, es­pe­cially in ar­eas in western and south­ern France that had been rel­a­tively spared dur­ing the height of the out­break be­tween March and May.</p>
    <p>“From Mon­day, mask-wear­ing will be manda­tory in closed spa­ces,” Dr Veran said on Twit­ter. “That con­cerns shops, build­ings open to the pub­lic, cov­ered mar­kets and banks.”</p>
    <p>France is also watch­ing coro­n­avirus clus­ters in neigh­bour­ing Spain very closely, Prime Min­is­ter Jean Cas­tex said, less than a month after the bor­der be­tween the two coun­tries was re­opened.</p>
    <p>“We are mon­i­tor­ing this very closely, here in par­tic­u­lar, be­cause it is a real is­sue that we also need to dis­cuss with the Span­ish au­thor­i­ties,” Mr Cas­tex said last Satur­day in re­sponse to a ques­tion about the pos­si­ble clo­sure of bor­ders.</p>
