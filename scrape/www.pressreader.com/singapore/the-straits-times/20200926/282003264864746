    <p>Three dis­tinct ele­ments de­fine the wave of protests rip­pling through Thai­land this year. Most no­tably, the protests are an un­prece­dented and open ag­i­ta­tion against King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn, the head of state and a fig­ure of un­par­al­leled in­flu­ence in the na­tion. The demon­stra­tions are largely un­struc­tured, led by dis­parate groups but draw­ing par­tic­i­pa­tion from tens of thou­sands of peo­ple, es­pe­cially the young. It is also note­wor­thy that the ral­lies are le­gal, hav­ing been al­lowed by the gov­ern­ment; and that they have re­mained peace­ful. The thrust of the de­mands is to seek a re­form of the monar­chy to make it truly tit­u­lar, and to amend the mil­i­tary-backed Con­sti­tu­tion – drawn up in 2017 and which helps en­sconce in power Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-Cha, a for­mer army chief who led a coup in 2014. The demon­stra­tors also want fresh elec­tions and have sought pro­tec­tion for gov­ern­ment crit­ics.</p>
    <p>The King has main­tained his si­lence while Mr Prayut has coun­selled pa­tience – not re­ject­ing the de­mands out­right but seek­ing to de­lay them. A bid this week to amend the Con­sti­tu­tion failed af­ter Par­lia­ment abruptly de­layed a vote that could have started the draft­ing process. In­stead, law­mak­ers voted to form a com­mit­tee to re­view draft amend­ments, push­ing the process back by about a month. The tac­tics in­fu­ri­ated pro­test­ers who had massed out­side Par­lia­ment and will likely fuel a gen­eral strike called for next month.</p>
    <p>The po­lit­i­cal tur­bu­lence could worsen the out­look for Asean’s sec­ond-largest econ­omy, with a rip­ple ef­fect on the re­gion, dim­ming its lure for in­vestors and tourists. It is likely to be one of Asia’s worst per­form­ers this year as both trade and do­mes­tic con­sump­tion reel from the Covid-19 pan­demic. The growth rate slumped by 12.2 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter this year, the most se­vere con­trac­tion since the 1998 Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis. At that time, then King Bhu­mi­bol Adulyadej, a revered fig­ure in Thai­land, ad­vo­cated mod­er­a­tion. He earned good­will that mag­ni­fied his power to pre­vail in dif­fi­cult times through his cham­pi­oning of causes such as ed­u­ca­tion and ru­ral in­fras­truc­ture pro­jects like dams. In his reign of nearly 70 years, the econ­omy ex­panded 40-fold and he served as a sta­bil­is­ing force.</p>
    <p>In the fraught po­lit­i­cal cli­mate of to­day, King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn also has a role to play. He has al­ready tem­pered the re­course to ap­ply lese­ma­jeste laws, which carry a pri­son sen­tence of up to 15 years for in­sult­ing the monar­chy, dur­ing the cur­rent bout of protests. While the sit­u­a­tion in the coun­try is some­thing for Thai so­ci­ety, its peo­ple and politi­cians to deal with and re­solve for them­selves, the King can use the pow­ers vested in his role to also ad­dress the con­cerns which have brought Thais out into the streets. In do­ing so, he can go a long way to help­ing lower the po­lit­i­cal tem­per­a­tures in the coun­try.</p>
