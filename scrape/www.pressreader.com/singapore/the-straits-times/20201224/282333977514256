    <p>New­cas­tle man­ager Steve Bruce con­ceded that the crit­i­cism lev­elled at him in the wake of Tues­day’s 1-0 League Cup de­feat by Cham­pi­onship club Brent­ford was fully jus­ti­fied but that it would not force him to step down from his role.</p>
    <p>Josh Dasilva’s sec­ond-half vol­ley de­nied the Mag­pies not only their first League Cup semi-fi­nal berth in over four decades but also ex­tended their tro­phy drought dat­ing back to 1955.</p>
    <p>The re­sult sparked a fu­ri­ous re­ac­tion on so­cial me­dia, with fans call­ing for Bruce’s sack­ing as he had fielded a strong line-up in con­trast to some pre­vi­ous cup ties, only for his side to flop against sec­ond-tier op­po­si­tion who had left their star for­ward Ivan Toney on the bench.</p>
    <p>“The sup­port­ers are en­ti­tled to their opin­ion so I have to ac­cept what is com­ing my way,” he said “That is part and par­cel of be­ing the man­ager of New­cas­tle.</p>
    <p>“You have to ac­cept the crit­i­cism, which is fully jus­ti­fied. We haven’t done enough, so we have to ac­cept what is com­ing our way.</p>
    <p>“We al­ways knew it was go­ing be dif­fi­cult but we ex­pected to per­form bet­ter than we did.</p>
    <p>“Un­for­tu­nately, we haven’t done enough, so we have to ac­cept what is com­ing our way and get ready for what is a huge chal­lenge ahead of us in the Premier League.</p>
    <p>“I can’t hide my dis­ap­point­ment be­cause we’ve had a great op­por­tu­nity to get into a first semi-fi­nal in many years. I’m bit­terly dis­ap­pointed and very, very frus­trated.</p>
    <p>“It’s good to get to a quar­ter-fi­nal but ob­vi­ously not great when you’ve got a great op­por­tu­nity to go fur­ther, so there’s a lot of dis­ap­pointed peo­ple to­day be­cause we’ve missed a big op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>“I am a re­silient so-and-so, so I have to ac­cept what is com­ing my way. I un­der­stand so­cial me­dia. All I can do is dust my­self down and go back to work to­mor­row.”</p>
    <p>For Brent­ford, less than five months af­ter their play-off fi­nal loss to Ful­ham at Wem­b­ley where they failed to gain their first pro­mo­tion to the Premier League, Tues­day’s win went some way to mak­ing up for that painful loss.</p>
    <p>The Bees are now in their first ma­jor cup semi-fi­nal, and hav­ing beaten three Premier League teams in a row to reach this stage, they want an­other Wem­b­ley fi­nal ap­pear­ance on April 25.</p>
    <p>Man­ager Thomas Frank said: “To get over the line and cre­ate a new chap­ter in Brent­ford his­tory, that’s a big step. It shows how far we have pro­gressed as a club.”</p>
