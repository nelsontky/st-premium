    <p>•</p>
    <p>At a Tokyo clinic i n Ja­pan, a woman in a white coat care­fully records the par­tic­u­lars of the new­est pa­tient – a sheepshape­d stuffed toy.</p>
    <p>The Nat­sumi Clinic spe­cialises in restor­ing much-loved ted­dies and other cud­dly toys to their orig­i­nal glory, de­light­ing deeply at­tached own­ers like Ms Yui Kato, who brought in her sheep Yuki-chan.</p>
    <p>“I thought I had no choice but to throw her away as she’s ab­so­lutely worn out, but then, I heard there’s a hospi­tal that deals with this sort of thing,” the 24-year-old said.</p>
    <p>“Maybe she won’t be ex­actly how she once was, but I came here hop­ing to see her healthy again.”</p>
    <p>The clinic of­fers treat­ments rang­ing from “eye surgery” and hair trans­plants to stitch­ing up in­juries, ex­plained founder Nat­sumi Hakozaki.</p>
    <p>She be­gan treat­ing stuffed toys four years ago in her home­town, north­ern Sendai city, af­ter work­ing at a clothes-al­ter­ation shop where cus­tomers of­ten asked if she could re­pair their trea­sured toys.</p>
    <p>“Cus­tomers saw stuffed toys as fam­ily mem­bers, part­ners or best friends, not mere ob­jects. Af­ter their stuffed toys were fixed, many of them hugged the toys or burst into tears,” Ms Hakozaki said.</p>
    <p>The ex­pe­ri­ence in­spired her to open a shop of­fer­ing spe­cialised treat­ment, and ev­ery an­i­mal is pre­scribed its own course.</p>
    <p>For Yuki-chan the sheep, Ms Hakozaki first re­moved the stuff­ing, then bathed her with a spe­cial soap, which she de­scribed as a “spa” treat­ment.</p>
    <p>The clinic care­fully doc­u­ments each stage of the treat­ment, post­ing im­ages on­line so own­ers can keep tabs.</p>
    <p>Ms Hakozaki is con­scious of how at­tached peo­ple can be­come to their stuffed a n i ma l s and con­sid­ers it key to treat the toys as if they were alive.</p>
    <p>“It looks like she was very tired. Please re­lax and en­joy,” the clinic cap­tioned a photo of Yuki-chan soak­ing in a foamy bath.</p>
    <p>Yuki-chan was in such bad shape that she needed to be re­con­sti­tuted from scratch. The bath re­turned her tat­tered skin to its orig­i­nal shape, al­low­ing Ms Hakozaki to use it to pat­tern new fab­ric.</p>
    <p>Once sewn to­gether, the fab­ric was filled with fresh stuff­ing, ef­fec­tively cre­at­ing an en­tirely new Yuki-chan, ex­cept for the “heart” – fash­ioned from pink cloth and filled with a bit of orig­i­nal stuff­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Hakozaki sees it as a way of trans­fer­ring the toy’s “soul” into the new body.</p>
    <p>The 34-year-old moved her busi­ness to Tokyo two years ago and now re­pairs 100 stuffed toys a month with five other “doc­tors”.</p>
    <p>Clients have sent toys from Hong Kong, Tai­wan, France and Bri­tain for treat­ment and cus­tomers have had to wait up to a year for a spot.</p>
    <p>Re­pairs take about 10 days and the clinic’s web­site fea­tures pic­tures of re­cov­ered “pa­tients” pho­tographed to­gether at “a party to cel­e­brate be­ing dis­charged”.</p>
    <p>There is only one other “clinic” for re­pair­ing stuffed toys in Ja­pan – in Osaka – and the de­mand comes de­spite prices that range from 10,000 yen (S$130) to 500,000 yen de­pend­ing on the in­juries.</p>
    <p>Yuki-chan’s makeover cost Ms Kato 100,000 yen, but for her, it was money well spent.</p>
    <p>“My mem­o­ries with her are more im­por­tant than money, so I don’t re­gret it,” she said, re­call­ing the “tough times” the stuffed sheep helped her get through.</p>
    <p>“I talked to her when I went to sleep to sort out my feel­ings and I used to cry in front of her.”</p>
    <p>Ms Kato said she cried again, but tears of joy this time, when she saw photos of Yuki-chan’s trans­for­ma­tion and was de­lighted when she came to pick up her old friend.</p>
    <p>“I’m gen­uinely sur­prised. She’s back to like she was when I got her for the first time,” she said.</p>
    <p>“She has a ‘ heart’ of stuff­ing in­side, so she has a new look, but a part of the mem­ory is still in her,” she added. “I’m so happy I can keep the mem­o­ries with me.”</p>
    <p>Other clients also ex­press deep emo­tional at­tach­ments to their stuffed an­i­mals, in­clud­ing Mr Kota Sano, who de­scribes his 40-yearold sea-ot­ter toy Rac­chan as “an in­dis­pens­able fam­ily mem­ber”.</p>
    <p>“She saved me when I was un­der pres­sure at work. She for­gives me and ac­cepts me,” he said, adding that his wife and son also adore the ot­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Sano ad­mit­ted he some­times feels em­bar­rassed about his af­fec­tion for the toy, but noted that tra­di­tional Ja­panese folk­lore says ob­jects can ac­quire their own spirit.</p>
    <p>They “can go be­yond just be­ing a thing and pos­sess per­son­al­ity,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Hakozaki un­der­stands the feel­ings own­ers have to­wards their toys.</p>
    <p>“We don’t just re­place a fa­ther be­cause he got sick. It’s the same thing” for stuffed toys, she said, de­scrib­ing the at­tach­ment as some­thing “uni­ver­sal”.</p>
    <p>“There are peo­ple not only in Ja­pan, but also around the world, who con­sider their stuffed toys as fam­ily mem­bers.”</p>
