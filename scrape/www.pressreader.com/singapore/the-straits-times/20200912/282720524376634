    <p>Bald spots on cat</p>
    <p>Do you think the bald spots on my cat are due to an in­fec­tion by ticks or mites?</p>
    <p>David Lee</p>
    <p>From your pho­tos, it looks like your cat has mul­ti­ple ar­eas of fur loss around his body. We can­not tell ex­actly what is caus­ing the fur loss with­out fur­ther skin tests, such as get­ting a skin scrape of the area and look­ing at it un­der the mi­cro­scope.</p>
    <p>Com­mon causes of fur loss can range from par­a­sites such as mites and fleas to bac­te­rial or fun­gal in­fec­tions to al­ler­gies to food or other al­ler­gens to over-groom­ing, which could have other un­der­ly­ing fac­tors such as stress.</p>
    <p>Re­gard­less of the cause, it is im­por­tant to keep up with your reg­u­lar ex­ter­nal par­a­site treat­ments to keep your cat pro­tected against mites, fleas and ticks.</p>
    <p>This should be done even when the con­di­tion of your cat’s skin and fur ap­pears to be fine.</p>
    <p>Lump on pet’s tail</p>
    <p>I dis­cov­ered a hard lump on my pet Si-Koh’s tail. It seems to be grow­ing big­ger and is caus­ing fur loss in the af­fected area. There are no signs of itch or pain. Please ad­vise if the lump is harm­ful and what could be the cause of it.</p>
    <p>Re­becca Wong</p>
    <p>It is not pos­si­ble to de­ter­mine whether the lump is harm­ful from merely the ap­pear­ance, which is why you should take your dog to the vet, es­pe­cially as you have no­ticed that the lump has been grow­ing in size.</p>
    <p>The vet will take a closer look at it and might take a sam­ple by do­ing a fine-nee­dle as­pi­rate or con­duct other di­ag­nos­tics to find out what it could be.</p>
    <p>It will also be help­ful to pro­vide the vet with in­for­ma­tion on when you first no­ticed the lump, its size when you first no­ticed it, how much it has grown and if there are any changes in ap­pear­ance – such as hair loss – as well as whether it feels hard or soft.</p>
    <p>Guinea pigs flee from touch­ing</p>
    <p>My guinea pigs run away when I try to touch them. What is the cause of this and what can I do to pre­vent it?</p>
    <p>Joyce Sen</p>
    <p>Guinea pigs are shy an­i­mals by na­ture, so it is in­stinc­tive for them to flee from what they per­ceive to be un­fa­mil­iar or threat­en­ing.</p>
    <p>To try to re­duce such a re­ac­tion, you should ap­proach them calmly and slowly and let them sniff you with­out at­tempt­ing to pat or pick them up. You can of­fer them food or treats with your hand to al­low them to get used to your smell and form a pos­i­tive as­so­ci­a­tion with your smell and hand.</p>
    <p>Their en­clo­sure should in­clude a hid­ing place for each of them so they can feel safe if they are stressed.</p>
    <p>You may be sur­prised, but a guinea pig that is more con­fi­dent in its en­vi­ron­ment will be more will­ing to come out and in­ter­act with you.</p>
