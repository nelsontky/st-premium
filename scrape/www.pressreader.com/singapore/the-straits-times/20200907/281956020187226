    <p>Last Thurs­day, Face­book’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Mark Zucker­berg an­nounced the com­pany’s “New Steps to Pro­tect the US Elec­tions”.</p>
    <p>They in­clude block­ing new po­lit­i­cal ads in the week lead­ing up to Elec­tion Day and at­tach­ing la­bels to posts con­tain­ing mis­in­for­ma­tion, specif­i­cally re­lated to the coron­avirus and posts from politi­cians declar­ing vic­tory be­fore all the re­sults are counted.</p>
    <p>One can – and many will – de­bate just how ef­fec­tive these mea­sures will be at pre­vent­ing elec­tion night chaos dur­ing a pan­demic. (So far, Face­book’s “mis­lead­ing post” la­bels are vague to the point of caus­ing ad­di­tional con­fu­sion for vot­ers. Sim­i­larly, block­ing new po­lit­i­cal ads one week out from the vote ig­nores the vast amounts of dis­in­for­ma­tion Amer­i­cans are sub­jected to year af­ter year.)</p>
    <p>But what seems be­yond de­bate is just how deeply Face­book has wo­ven it­self into the fab­ric of democ­racy.</p>
    <p>Read­ing Mr Zucker­berg’s elec­tion se­cu­rity blog post re­minded me of a line from a sem­i­nal 2017 ar­ti­cle by jour­nal­ist Max Read. Three years ago, Mr Read was struck by a sim­i­lar pledge from Mr Zucker­berg to “en­sure the in­tegrity” of the Ger­man elec­tions.</p>
    <p>The com­mit­ment was ad­mirable, he wrote, but also a tacit ad­mis­sion of Face­book’s im­mense power. “It’s a dec­la­ra­tion that Face­book is as­sum­ing a level of power at once of the state and be­yond it, as a sov­er­eign, self-reg­u­lat­ing, supra-state en­tity within which states them­selves op­er­ate.”</p>
    <p>IRON GRIP ON COM­PANY</p>
    <p>That power is con­sol­i­dated in the de­ci­sions of its CEO, who has vot­ing con­trol over the com­pany.</p>
    <p>Here’s how Face­book’s co-founder Chris Hughes de­scribed Mr Zucker­berg’s iron grip on the com­pany in The New York Times last year: Mr Zucker­berg’s in­flu­ence is stag­ger­ing, far be­yond that of any­one else in the pri­vate sec­tor or in gov­ern­ment. He con­trols three core com­mu­ni­ca­tions plat­forms – Face­book, In­sta­gram and What­sApp – that bil­lions of peo­ple use ev­ery day. Face­book’s board works more like an ad­vi­sory com­mit­tee than an over­seer be­cause he con­trols around 60 per cent of vot­ing shares. He alone can de­cide how to con­fig­ure Face­book’s al­go­rithms to de­ter­mine what peo­ple see in their news feeds, what pri­vacy set­tings they can use, and even which mes­sages get de­liv­ered.</p>
    <p>He also sets the rules for how to dis­tin­guish vi­o­lent and in­cen­di­ary speech from the merely of­fen­sive, and he can choose to shut down a com­peti­tor by ac­quir­ing, block­ing or copy­ing it.</p>
    <p>If Mr Hughes’ de­scrip­tion feels hy­per­bolic, it may be be­cause such a con­sol­i­da­tion of power is ac­tu­ally hard to com­pre­hend.</p>
    <p>“I think we un­der­es­ti­mate Face­book’s power con­stantly,” Dr Siva Vaid­hyanathan, a pro­fes­sor of me­dia stud­ies at the Univer­sity of Vir­ginia, told me. “It’s re­ally hard for hu­man be­ings to pic­ture in their head the ac­tual size and in­flu­ence of the plat­form. Some­thing like one out of three peo­ple use the thing – it’s like noth­ing we’ve en­coun­tered in hu­man his­tory. And I’m not sure Mark Zucker­berg is even will­ing to con­tem­plate his in­flu­ence. I’m not sure he’d ever sleep if he ever thought about how much power he has.”</p>
    <p>GRIM CIR­CLE OF LIFE</p>
    <p>Face­book’s power is now self-per­pet­u­at­ing.</p>
    <p>Last week pro­vided a great ex­am­ple. On Tues­day, Face­book and other plat­forms re­vealed a covert op­er­a­tion run by the Krem­lin-backed In­ter­net Re­search Agency to sow divi­sion ahead of the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion by set­ting up a net­work of fake user ac­counts and web­sites.</p>
    <p>This time, though, the agency hired un­wit­ting Amer­i­can free­lance jour­nal­ists to cre­ate the content.</p>
    <p>There’s a grim cir­cle-of-life qual­ity to this news. Face­book’s un­prece­dented growth and com­man­deer­ing of the dig­i­tal ad­ver­tis­ing mar­ket – along­side Google and oth­ers – helped ac­cel­er­ate the col­lapse of jour­nal­ism’s bro­ken busi­ness mod­els. This led to con­sol­i­da­tion, pub­li­ca­tions shut­ter­ing and lay­offs of jour­nal­ists ev­ery­where. Face­book’s news dom­i­nance and mer­cu­rial dis­tri­bu­tion al­go­rithms led to a rise of hy­per-par­ti­san pages and web­sites to fill the gaps and cap­i­talise on the plat­form’s abil­ity to mon­e­tise en­gage­ment, which in turn led to a glut of vi­ral mis­in­for­ma­tion and dis­in­for­ma­tion that Face­book has been un­able (or per­haps un­will­ing) to ad­e­quately po­lice.</p>
    <p>This free-for-all has made Face­book the plat­form of choice for po­lit­i­cal ma­nip­u­la­tion. Those bad ac­tors are now hir­ing and ex­ploit­ing the very free­lance jour­nal­ists dis­placed by the col­lapse of the me­dia in­dus­try that Face­book helped ac­cel­er­ate.</p>
    <p>Even­tu­ally, Face­book takes ac­tion to re­move the bad ac­tors, as­sur­ing the coun­try of its com­mit­ment to democ­racy and ce­ment­ing its role as a pro­tec­tor of free and fair elec­tions. Face­book wins in ev­ery di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>Its size and power cre­ates in­sta­bil­ity, the an­swer to which, ac­cord­ing to Face­book, is to give the com­pany ad­di­tional au­thor­ity.</p>
    <p>This cy­cle is un­sus­tain­able. This sum­mer has shown that the plat­form has been a prime vec­tor for the most desta­bil­is­ing forces in Amer­i­can life. It has helped su­per­charge con­spir­a­cies around the dan­ger­ous QAnon move­ment. It has pro­vided or­gan­i­sa­tion for, and am­pli­fied calls to ac­tion from, mili­tia move­ments, which have been linked to deaths in US cities at protests.</p>
    <p>Its mod­er­a­tion poli­cies have failed to catch bla­tant rule vi­o­la­tions around voter dis­en­fran­chise­ment, and the con­spir­acy the­o­ries that go vi­ral on the plat­form have found their way, time and again, to United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s mouth.</p>
    <p>Face­book em­ploy­ees seem to un­der­stand the sit­u­a­tion is un­ten­able and are speak­ing out in­ter­nally against Mr Zucker­berg’s lead­er­ship. “He seems truly in­ca­pable of tak­ing per­sonal re­spon­si­bil­ity for de­ci­sions and ac­tions at Face­book,” one</p>
    <p>Face­book em­ployee told Buz­zFeed News re­cently af­ter a com­pany meet­ing in re­sponse to the vi­o­lence in Kenosha, Wis­con­sin.</p>
    <p>With just two months to go be­fore the elec­tion, the na­tion’s fo­cus is on the in­tegrity of the elec­toral process. With the Pres­i­dent threat­en­ing to un­der­mine the re­sults of the elec­tion, the stakes could not be higher.</p>
    <p>As Mr Zucker­berg wrote last Thurs­day: “We all have a re­spon­si­bil­ity to pro­tect our democ­racy.”</p>
    <p>But what does it say that one of those in­sti­tu­tions charged with pro­tect­ing democ­racy is, it­self, struc­tured more like a dic­ta­tor­ship?</p>
    <p>“Face­book had grown too big, and its users too com­pla­cent, for democ­racy,” Mr Read con­cluded at the end of his 2017 piece. His words feel pre­scient to­day as Face­book, unchecked and un­reg­u­lated by gov­ern­ments, positions it­self as a pri­mary line of de­fence to pro­tect those in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>At first, Mr Zucker­berg’s re­cent elec­tion pledge might feel com­fort­ing (Some­body! Do­ing some­thing!).</p>
    <p>But his plan is an ad­mis­sion of a great power that should make Amer­i­cans un­com­fort­able. In their quest to fend off a would-be strong­man’s power grab in one realm, Amer­i­cans ought not al­low a stronger man’s power grab in an­other.</p>
