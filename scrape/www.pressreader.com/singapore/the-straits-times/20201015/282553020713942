    <p>When Saul Bel­low won the No­bel Prize in lit­er­a­ture in 1976, he com­mented: “The child in me is de­lighted. The adult in me is scep­ti­cal.”</p>
    <p>Bel­low saw a “se­cret hu­mil­i­a­tion” in the fact that “some of the very great writ­ers of the cen­tury didn’t get it”.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can poet Louise Gluck, 77, who won the prize this year, has long been scep­ti­cal of praise too.</p>
    <p>In a 2009 in­ter­view, she said: “When I’m told I have a large read­er­ship, I think, ‘Oh great, I’m go­ing to turn out to be Longfel­low’: some­one easy to un­der­stand, easy to like, the kind of di­luted ex­pe­ri­ence avail­able to many. And I don’t want to be Longfel­low. Sorry, Henry, but I don’t. To the de­gree that I ap­pre­hend ac­claim, I think, ‘Ah, it’s a flaw in the work.’”</p>
    <p>Gluck – her sur­name rhymes with “click”, not “cluck” – is not the new Longfel­low. Yet it is part of her great­ness that her po­ems are rel­a­tively easy of ac­cess while im­pos­si­ble to ut­terly get to the bot­tom of. They have echo­ing mean­ings; you can tan­gle with them for a very long time.</p>
    <p>I have ar­gued that her 1990 book, Ararat, is the most bru­tal and sor­row-filled book of po­etry pub­lished in the last 30 years (it is con­tained in her col­lec­tion Po­ems: 1962-2012). It is con­fes­sional and a bit wild, I wrote, com­par­ing it with Bob Dy­lan’s Blood On The Tracks.</p>
    <p>One of the things to love about Gluck’s po­etry is that, while her work con­tains many emo­tional reg­is­ters, she is not afraid to be cruel – she con­fronts the mon­sters in her­self, and in oth­ers, not with res­ig­na­tion and ther­a­peu­tic di­gres­sion but with artery-nick­ing knives.</p>
    <p>Poet Kay Ryan, in her ter­rific new book of es­says, Syn­the­siz­ing Grav­ity, writes: “I think it’s good to ad­mit what a wolfish thing art is; I trust writ­ers who know they aren’t nice.”</p>
    <p>Gluck’s work is re­plete with not­nice­ness. You would not, you sense, want her as an en­emy.</p>
    <p>As I write this, I have my copy of Po­ems: 1962-2012 splayed out be­side me on my writ­ing ta­ble.</p>
    <p>It is pretty well marked up. You can flip it open al­most any­where and find fly­ing shards of dark in­tel­lect and beasty wit.</p>
    <p>“You should take one of those chem­i­cals,/maybe you’d write more” is a char­ac­ter­is­tic put-down.</p>
    <p>So is: “Your back is my fa­vorite part of you,/the part fur­thest away from your mouth.”</p>
    <p>So is: “I ex­pected bet­ter of two crea­tures/who were given minds.”</p>
    <p>Per­haps ex­plain­ing such lines, she has also writ­ten: “You show re­spect by fight­ing./To let up in­sults the op­po­nent.”</p>
    <p>Gluck’s free verse is ex­act­ing, taut and rhetor­i­cally or­gan­ised.</p>
    <p>The­mat­i­cally, the mire­poix is com­posed of fam­ily, child­hood, love, sex, death, na­ture, an­i­mals. Her clas­si­cal al­lu­sions are deft. She is a se­ri­ous poet of the ap­petites. Even when she os­ten­si­bly writes about food, she is writ­ing about 11 other things at the same mo­ment.</p>
    <p>A poem called Bas­kets in­cludes these lines: “I take my bas­ket to the brazen mar­ket,/to the gath­er­ing place,/I ask you, how much beauty/ can a per­son bear? It is/heav­ier than ug­li­ness, even the bur­den/of empti­ness is noth­ing be­side it./Crates of eggs, pa­paya, sacks of yel­low lemons – /I am not a strong wo­man. It isn’t easy to want so much, to walk/with such a heavy bas­ket,/ei­ther bent reed, or wil­low.”</p>
    <p>Gluck was born in New York City in 1943 and grew up on Long Is­land. Her fa­ther helped in­vent the XActo knife.</p>
    <p>That is a cos­mi­cally sub­lime de­tail; no other poet slices with such ac­cu­racy and deadly in­tent.</p>
    <p>She at­tended Sarah Lawrence Col­lege and Columbia Univer­sity, but took no de­gree. She was United States poet lau­re­ate in 2003 and 2004. She has won most of this coun­try’s ma­jor po­etry prizes.</p>
    <p>When she was young, she suf­fered from anorexia ner­vosa.</p>
    <p>She does not ad­dress this sub­ject of­ten, or di­rectly, in her work. But here is a sec­tion of her poem Ded­i­ca­tion To Hunger: “It be­gins qui­etly/in cer­tain fe­male chil­dren:/ the fear of death, tak­ing as its form/ ded­i­ca­tion to hunger,/be­cause a wo­man’s body/is a grave; it will ac­cept/any­thing.”</p>
    <p>She has be­come a pro­found and witty poet about grow­ing old.</p>
    <p>In Averno, she writes about the speaker’s chil­dren: “I know what they say when I’m out of the room./Should I be see­ing some­one, should I be tak­ing/one of the new drugs for de­pres­sion./I can hear them, in whis­pers, plan­ning how to di­vide the cost./And I want to scream out/you’re all of you liv­ing in a dream./Bad enough, they think, to watch me fall­ing apart. /Bad enough with­out this lec­tur­ing they get these days/as though I had any right to this new in­for­ma­tion./Well, they have the same right./They’re liv­ing in a dream, and I’m pre­par­ing/to be a ghost.”</p>
    <p>In an­other poem, she asks: “Why love what you will lose?”</p>
    <p>She an­swers her own ques­tion: “There is noth­ing else to love.”</p>
    <p>He­len Vendler, writ­ing in The New Repub­lic, said that Gluck’s po­ems “have achieved the un­usual dis­tinc­tion of be­ing nei­ther ‘con­fes­sional’ nor ‘in­tel­lec­tual’ in the usual senses of those words”.</p>
    <p>It is her abun­dant in­tel­lect, and deep feel­ing, that keeps pulling you back to her po­ems.</p>
    <p>Com­ment­ing on the poor choices the Swedish Academy has made in the past, Gore Vi­dal once ad­vised to never un­der­es­ti­mate Scan­di­na­vian wit. In the case of Louise Gluck, the academy gets one ex­actly right.</p>
