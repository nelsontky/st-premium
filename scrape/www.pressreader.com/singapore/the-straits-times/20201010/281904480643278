    <p>WASHINGTON • In 2012, just be­fore tak­ing over as China’s leader, Mr Xi Jin­ping spent a week in the United States in an ef­fort to charm the Amer­i­can pub­lic. He vis­ited a farm in Iowa where he had stayed as a young man and took in a Lak­ers bas­ket­ball match in Los An­ge­les, pos­ing for pho­to­graphs with re­tired legend Magic John­son.</p>
    <p>His host for the trip was then Vice-Pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den, who praised Mr Xi for his will­ing­ness to shake up the im­pres­sion Amer­i­cans might have about Chi­nese politi­cians.</p>
    <p>“This is a guy who wants to feel it and taste it, and he’s pre­pared to show an­other side of the Chi­nese lead­er­ship,” Mr Bi­den said at the time.</p>
    <p>Eight years later, the now Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date has a very dif­fer­ent tone. “This is a guy who doesn’t have a demo­cratic – with a small ‘d’ – bone in his body,” he said in Fe­bru­ary about Mr Xi. “This is a guy who is a thug.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den is not alone in see­ing Bei­jing through dif­fer­ent eyes. In the hy­per-par­ti­san Washington dur­ing the pres­i­dency of Mr Don­ald Trump, Democrats and Repub­li­cans are locked in com­bat over the Supreme Court, the eco­nomic re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and even over mask-wear­ing. China is al­most the sole ex­cep­tion where com­mon ground is to be found.</p>
    <p>Over the past few years, there has been a fun­da­men­tal shift in how the US thinks about China that spans the po­lit­i­cal spec­trum, even if some of the re­cent rhetoric is partly a prod­uct of both par­ties not want­ing to ap­pear soft be­fore the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The geopo­lit­i­cal ten­sions be­tween the US and China have been ris­ing since the fi­nan­cial cri­sis more than a decade ago. China’s mil­i­tary started to boost its pres­ence in the South China Sea as Bei­jing sought to chal­lenge the pri­macy of the US Navy. In 2009, China also barred Google,</p>
    <p>Face­book and sev­eral other US In­ter­net groups – the start of a split of the tech­nol­ogy world into two spheres that is now ac­cel­er­at­ing.</p>
    <p>But one of the main rea­sons for the es­ca­la­tion in the ri­valry be­tween the US and China over the past few years – which some now see as the start of a new Cold War – has been the surge in scep­ti­cism about Bei­jing across Amer­ica’s po­lit­i­cal elite.</p>
    <p>CALL­ING A SPADE A SPADE</p>
    <p>In late 2017, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion sig­nalled it would take a tougher ap­proach when it de­scribed China as a “re­vi­sion­ist power” in its first na­tional se­cu­rity re­view. Few in Washington com­plained.</p>
    <p>“That was a huge shift in men­tal­ity that has tremen­dous bi­par­ti­san sup­port,” says re­tired gen­eral H.R. McMaster, who was Mr Trump’s na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser at the time.</p>
    <p>For­mer Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion White House Asia ad­viser Evan Medeiros ac­knowl­edges that the la­bel sim­ply re­flected the new re­al­ity in Washington. “When the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion framed the US-China re­la­tion­ship in terms of strate­gic com­pe­ti­tion, many Amer­i­cans were there al­ready. They just hadn’t given it a name,” says Mr Medeiros, who is a critic of how Mr Trump has han­dled China.</p>
    <p>“Trump opened the flood­gates and peo­ple said it’s time to call a spade a spade.</p>
    <p>“Amer­i­can elite and pop­u­lar opinion has fun­da­men­tally changed. We have moved from bal­anc­ing co­op­er­a­tion and com­pe­ti­tion, to com­pe­ti­tion and con­fronta­tion.”</p>
    <p>That does not mean a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion would adopt the same poli­cies to­wards China that would be seen in a sec­ond Trump term. In some ar­eas – such as sub­si­dies to in­dus­try – it might be tougher, work­ing closely with Europe and other al­lies to con­strain China, while on other is­sues, such as cli­mate change, it might be more open to co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>But it does mean that re­gard­less of which can­di­date wins the elec­tion, the leader tak­ing of­fice in Jan­uary will pre­side over a rad­i­cally dif­fer­ent US-China re­la­tion­ship from eight years ago, when Mr Bi­den and Mr Xi were both vice-pres­i­dents – or even four years ago.</p>
    <p>“There is an ex­is­ten­tial com­pe­ti­tion be­tween two coun­tries with fun­da­men­tally dif­fer­ent vi­sions,” says Dr Mike Gal­lagher, a Wis­con­sin Repub­li­can law­maker and China hawk. “This is more com­pli­cated than the old Cold War.”</p>
    <p>A RE­SPON­SI­BLE STAKE­HOLDER?</p>
    <p>The more con­fronta­tional ap­proach to­wards China may have been build­ing for some time, but it still rep­re­sents a dra­matic shift.</p>
    <p>In the four decades af­ter then Pres­i­dent Richard Nixon es­tab­lished diplo­matic ties with Bei­jing, the US worked to bring China into the in­ter­na­tional sys­tem that it cre­ated af­ter World War II.</p>
    <p>The project nearly col­lapsed at cer­tain mo­ments – no­tably af­ter the 1989 Tianan­men Square mas­sacre. But it ul­ti­mately led to China join­ing the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion in 2001. Four years later, Mr Robert Zoel­lick, deputy sec­re­tary of state in the Ge­orge W. Bush ad­min­is­tra­tion, urged China to be­come a “re­spon­si­ble stake­holder” in that sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Mr Barack Obama broadly kept that ap­proach, al­though his ad­min­is­tra­tion also started to hedge against Chi­nese as­sertive­ness with a “pivot” that put more mil­i­tary as­sets in the Asia-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>But it was dur­ing his pres­i­dency that many law­mak­ers, of­fi­cials, aca­demics and com­pa­nies be­came in­creas­ingly pes­simistic that China un­der Mr Xi would pur­sue real po­lit­i­cal or eco­nomic re­form.</p>
    <p>Now, af­ter four tur­bu­lent years of re­la­tions dur­ing the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, there are very few sub­scribers to the the­ory that en­gage­ment with China will lead the coun­try to be­come more lib­eral.</p>
    <p>“The re­spon­si­ble stake­holder era, which was a bi­par­ti­san ap­proach, is over,” says Mr Derek Chol­let, a for­mer Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion Pen­tagon and Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil of­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>COM­PLAINTS AND BRO­KEN PROM­ISES</p>
    <p>The list of US com­plaints is long and broad, span­ning from cy­ber es­pi­onage to ten­sions in the South China Sea, hu­man rights, in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty rights and mar­ket ac­cess for Amer­i­can firms in China.</p>
    <p>There is also much less trust in Mr Xi. In 2015, he stood in the White House Rose Gar­den and promised Mr Obama that China would not mil­i­tarise the ar­ti­fi­cial is­lands it was build­ing in the South China Sea – but then pro­ceeded to do ex­actly that at a fast pace.</p>
    <p>More re­cently, the US has turned up the heat on China over its de­ten­tion of an es­ti­mated one mil­lion Uighur Mus­lims in Xin­jiang.</p>
    <p>Across the po­lit­i­cal elite, there is con­sen­sus that large parts of the tech­nol­ogy sec­tor should be off-lim­its for Chi­nese in­vest­ment be­cause of its po­ten­tial for mil­i­tary or es­pi­onage use.</p>
    <p>When the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion strong-armed al­lies to can­cel con­tracts with Chi­nese telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions equip­ment maker Huawei ear­lier this year – a form of pres­sure that would have been un­think­able a few years ago – there was lit­tle dis­agree­ment in Washington, even if some Democrats be­lieve the ad­min­is­tra­tion has pushed the idea of eco­nomic “de­cou­pling” too ag­gres­sively.</p>
    <p>“There is no ques­tion that Xi Jin­ping has taken China in a dif­fer­ent di­rec­tion... even a more au­thor­i­tar­ian di­rec­tion,” says Mr</p>
    <p>Jeff Prescott, a China ex­pert and senior for­eign pol­icy ad­viser to the Bi­den cam­paign. “The next pres­i­dent is go­ing to have to re­cal­i­brate the re­la­tion­ship with China.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter tar­get­ing Bei­jing dur­ing the 2016 elec­tion cam­paign, Mr Trump ac­tu­ally entered of­fice try­ing to mend fences with Bei­jing. He talked up his rap­port with his “good friend” Mr Xi, who he feted over choco­late cake at his Mar-a-Lago re­sort in Florida in April 2017.</p>
    <p>But the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion soon started to take a more hawk­ish view, ex­em­pli­fied by the na­tional se­cu­rity re­view later that year. Mr McMaster says the doc­u­ment gave the green light to gov­ern­ment agen­cies to toughen their ap­proach.</p>
    <p>The Justice De­part­ment, for ex­am­ple, cre­ated a unit called the “China Ini­tia­tive”, which has spent two years crack­ing down on es­pi­onage.</p>
    <p>“Their in­ves­ti­ga­tions in­creased dra­mat­i­cally af­ter we an­nounced the shift,” says Mr McMaster.</p>
    <p>One senior Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cial says that un­til the Pres­i­dent stood up to Bei­jing, many peo­ple in Washington had as­sumed China was un­stop­pable and that US rhetoric and pol­icy had de­vel­oped a “de­featist smell”.</p>
    <p>“You had senior US of­fi­cials par­rot­ing Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party jar­gon about a new type of great power re­la­tions that would al­low for win-win so­lu­tions, by which they ap­par­ently meant China would win twice,” the of­fi­cial says.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump was cau­tious about alien­at­ing Bei­jing, to avoid jeop­ar­dis­ing ne­go­ti­a­tions aimed at end­ing the trade war that he had launched against China. But that changed dra­mat­i­cally this year.</p>
    <p>Af­ter sign­ing a lim­ited phase one trade deal in Jan­uary, he backed a slew of ac­tions against China, over ev­ery­thing from hu­man rights abuses in Xin­jiang, to the im­po­si­tion of a dra­co­nian se­cu­rity law in Hong Kong, to threat­en­ing to ban video-shar­ing app TikTok.</p>
    <p>Some US of­fi­cials say Mr Trump is pun­ish­ing China for not hav­ing done more to pre­vent Covid-19 from spread­ing to Amer­ica, which he be­lieves has hurt his chances of re-elec­tion. Many ex­perts be­lieve Mr Trump will con­tinue his cur­rent ap­proach in a sec­ond term, un­less he eases off on se­cu­rity to get a com­pre­hen­sive trade deal.</p>
    <p>BI­DEN’S AP­PROACH</p>
    <p>The big­ger ques­tion is how Mr Bi­den, a for­mer Se­nate For­eign Re­la­tions Com­mit­tee chair­man who first vis­ited China in 1979 and has been steeped in these is­sues for three decades, would treat China if he is elected.</p>
    <p>Mr Tom Donilon, for­mer na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser to Mr Obama, says Mr Bi­den’s ap­proach would have echoes of “sit­u­a­tions of strength”, a ref­er­ence to Tru­man ad­min­is­tra­tion Sec­re­tary of State Dean Ach­e­son, who ar­gued that the US should work with like-minded al­lies.</p>
    <p>“He sees the China chal­lenge clearly and knows we need to put our­selves in the strong­est pos­si­ble po­si­tion to meet it. There would be a ma­jor re­align­ment with al­lies,” Mr Donilon says.</p>
    <p>Mr Prescott says Mr Bi­den would rally al­lies such as the Euro­pean Union to tackle the “ag­gres­sive and preda­tory chal­lenges” from China – in con­trast with the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s ap­proach. “We shouldn’t be in­sult­ing our friends. We should be work­ing with them to ad­dress some of the chal­lenges from China.”</p>
    <p>Sup­port­ers of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion ar­gue that it worked with Asia-Pa­cific and other al­lies to purge Huawei from their net­works. But even some fans of Mr Trump ar­gue that he could have strength­ened his hand with Bei­jing by work­ing closer with al­lies.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has re­jected crit­i­cism that he would not be tough. His team in­cludes ad­vis­ers known for more hawk­ish views, such as Dr Ely Rat­ner, who was his deputy na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser dur­ing the</p>
    <p>Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>But Mr Bi­den will also have senior ad­vis­ers who be­lieve that cli­mate change is one of the big­gest chal­lenges fac­ing the US – a po­si­tion that might make them more open to co­op­er­at­ing with China.</p>
    <p>Some in the na­tional se­cu­rity com­mu­nity fear this could lead to a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion mak­ing too many com­pro­mises.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think any­one thinks we’re go­ing to turn the clock back, even with a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion,” says Mr McMaster. “But I am afraid that some Bi­den ad­vis­ers will say we have to give on some things to get help from China on en­vi­ron­men­tal is­sues.”</p>
    <p>Dr Gal­lagher says there is a dan­ger that Mr Bi­den will fall for the Chi­nese ap­proach of dan­gling co­op­er­a­tion on cli­mate as a</p>
    <p>“holis­tic bar­gain­ing chip” to get the US to take a softer ap­proach on other is­sues. “If Bi­den tries to go back to the sta­tus quo and take a more ac­com­moda­tive ap­proach, he’s go­ing to get mugged by re­al­ity.”</p>
    <p>Some Repub­li­cans warn that a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will be too soft on trade. In­flu­en­tial Repub­li­can Se­na­tor Marco Ru­bio told the Fi­nan­cial Times that Mr Bi­den’s record on China over his ca­reer “makes clear his poli­cies al­most cer­tainly ac­cel­er­ated the ero­sion of our na­tion’s man­u­fac­tur­ing in­dus­try and off­shoring of mil­lions of good-pay­ing jobs”.</p>
    <p>Mr Frank Jan­nuzi, who served as Mr Bi­den’s East Asia ad­viser in the Se­nate for many years, says the for­mer vice-pres­i­dent has a very sober view of China and be­lieves it has changed for the worse.</p>
    <p>“He has adopted a more mus­cu­lar tone in pub­lic,” says Mr Jan­nuzi. “This is a China where the Com­mu­nist Party is en­gaged in hor­ri­ble hu­man rights... in Xin­jiang in par­tic­u­lar. Even those who were fans of en­gage­ment are adapt­ing to the new China.”</p>
    <p>HU­MAN RIGHTS</p>
    <p>Mr Prescott says one dra­matic dif­fer­ence be­tween Mr Bi­den and Mr Trump would be on hu­man rights. While the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion this year im­posed sanc­tions on Chi­nese of­fi­cials over poli­cies in Xin­jiang, Hong Kong and Ti­bet, Mr Trump him­self has rarely spo­ken about hu­man rights.</p>
    <p>Mr John Bolton, his for­mer na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser, wrote in his re­cent book that Mr Trump ef­fec­tively gave Mr Xi a green light to de­tain the Uighurs.</p>
    <p>Mr Prescott says: “We should be stand­ing up for our val­ues and speak­ing out about democ­racy and hu­man rights.”</p>
    <p>Mr Chol­let says Mr Bi­den would in­evitably take a tougher ap­proach than Mr Obama. “There is go­ing to be a more hawk­ish ap­proach to China,” he says. “Even if Obama was FDR (Franklin D. Roo­sevelt) and go­ing into his fourth term, he would be more hawk­ish. It’s not a re­pu­di­a­tion of what came be­fore, it’s just that things have changed.”</p>
    <p>Whether the su­per­power spar­ring es­ca­lates un­der whichever can­di­date who wins will not just be a re­sult of how these de­bates play out in Washington – it will also de­pend on how Bei­jing re­sponds.</p>
    <p>Sup­port­ers of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion ar­gue that it worked with Asia-Pa­cific and other al­lies to purge Huawei from their net­works. But even some fans of Mr Trump ar­gue that he could have strength­ened his hand with Bei­jing by work­ing closer with al­lies. Mr Bi­den has re­jected crit­i­cism that he would not be tough. His team in­cludes ad­vis­ers known for more hawk­ish views, such as Dr Ely Rat­ner, who was his deputy na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser dur­ing the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>HOW WILL XI RE­ACT?</p>
    <p>Some Amer­i­can of­fi­cials be­lieve the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment recog­nises that it has pushed too far and helped pro­duce a back­lash in Washington.</p>
    <p>“There has also been a sub­stan­tial re­think on US-China pol­icy in China,” says Mr Donilon. “There is a com­pre­hen­sive as­sess­ment un­der way in the Xi gov­ern­ment. China is not go­ing to for­get the lessons of the last three years.”</p>
    <p>Dr Ori­ana Sky­lar Mas­tro, a China ex­pert at Stan­ford Univer­sity, says it is not clear how re­cep­tive Mr Xi would be if the next ad­min­is­tra­tion were to try to change the re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>“Some say China will fa­cil­i­tate a re­set and be nice while oth­ers say it will try to test the new pres­i­dent like it did with Obama,” says Dr Mas­tro. “If Bi­den pur­sues a mod­er­ate strat­egy and China’s re­sponse is provoca­tive and ag­gres­sive, it’s go­ing to un­der­mine those ef­forts. That’s how the China doves be­came China hawks.”</p>
    <p>Dr Su­san Shirk, chair of the 21st Cen­tury China Cen­tre at the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia San Diego, says the key is Mr Xi him­self. While she is crit­i­cal of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, she also lev­els blame at the Chi­nese Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>“The Chi­nese side brought a lot of it on them­selves. I don’t think this is just dreamt up out of the fore­head of McMaster or Matt Pot­tinger,” says Dr Shirk, re­fer­ring to the cur­rent deputy na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser and China hawk.</p>
    <p>“If the door is a lit­tle bit open, does Xi have the good sense to walk through? I’m al­ways look­ing for ev­i­dence of re­straint and flex­i­bil­ity... but mostly I see rigid­ity. He has a very poor un­der­stand­ing of the West.”</p>
