    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysia is plan­ning to file a World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO) case this year against the Euro­pean Union over its re­stric­tions on palm oil bio­fuel, Deputy Plan­ta­tion In­dus­tries and Com­modi­ties Min­is­ter Wil­lie Mon­gin said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Malaysia is adamant and stead­fast in tak­ing le­gal ac­tion against the EU on its dis­crim­i­na­tion to­wards Malaysian palm oil,” he said dur­ing an on­line con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Malaysia is the world’s sec­ond­largest palm oil pro­ducer and ex­porter.</p>
    <p>The Malaysian Palm Oil As­so­ci­a­tion (MPOA) said yes­ter­day sep­a­rately that it is los­ing up to 25 per cent of its po­ten­tial palm oil yield due to a labour short­age that is ex­pected to worsen in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>The group, which rep­re­sents plan­ta­tion firms, said the gov­ern­ment’s de­ci­sion to freeze the re­cruit­ment of new for­eign work­ers un­til De­cem­ber could lead to the “demise” of the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“Pre-Covid, we were al­ready short of 36,000 work­ers. This (short­age) has al­ready re­sulted in us not real­is­ing our po­ten­tial pro­duc­tion by 10 to 25 per cent,” MPOA chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Nageeb Wa­hab said in a con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Malaysia re­lies heav­ily on work­ers from coun­tries such as In­done­sia and Bangladesh as they ac­count for 84 per cent of its plan­ta­tion work­force.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands have al­ready left palm es­tates for home as bor­ders closed amid the pan­demic, and the group said it had not been able to re­place those who had left.</p>
    <p>A dearth of work­ers could de­lay palm fruit har­vest­ing and curb oil out­put, espe­cially ahead of the peak pro­duc­tion sea­son that starts around Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Mr Nageeb said plan­ta­tion com­pa­nies were ac­tively hir­ing lo­cals in sup­port of the gov­ern­ment’s pol­icy, but lo­cals were not in­ter­ested in what they see as dirty, dan­ger­ous, dif­fi­cult and de­mean­ing work.</p>
    <p>“If this (lo­cal re­cruit­ment ef­fort) fails, we will need the gov­ern­ment to help us,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Wil­lie said the min­istry was in talks with in­dus­try groups to ad­dress the labour con­cerns.</p>
    <p>“We will dis­cuss and for­mu­late a strat­egy to ad­dress labour short­age is­sue,” he said dur­ing the con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Pre-Covid, we were al­ready short of 36,000 work­ers. This (short­age) has al­ready re­sulted in us not real­is­ing our po­ten­tial pro­duc­tion by 10 to 25 per cent.</p>
