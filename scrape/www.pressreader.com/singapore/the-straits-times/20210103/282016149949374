    <p>The mo­bile gam­ing mar­ket in Sin­ga­pore is now so lu­cra­tive that com­pa­nies ap­pear to be buy­ing more public out­door ad­ver­tise­ments for them. Such ads were un­com­mon a decade ago.</p>
    <p>This comes even as con­cerns rise over gam­bling-like el­e­ments called loot boxes com­monly found in these ad­ver­tised games.</p>
    <p>The lat­est no­table cam­paign was for the pop­u­lar mo­bile game Gen­shin Im­pact launched in Septem­ber. Large mu­rals were seen on the walls of the linkway be­tween the North East Line and Cir­cle Line plat­forms at Seran­goon in­ter­change, as well as at Dhoby Ghaut and Jurong East MRT sta­tions.</p>
    <p>Ads for other mo­bile games like 2019’s Over­hit and Yokai Kitchen have ap­peared at bus stops and have been screened in cin­e­mas.</p>
    <p>While ex­act fig­ures are not avail­able, game in­dus­try ex­perts said such ads were not so com­mon a decade ago. Their grow­ing pres­ence now re­flects the ris­ing prof­itabil­ity of mo­bile games and the for­tunes of their de­vel­op­ers.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to mo­bile con­sul­tancy App An­nie, con­sumer spend­ing here within gam­ing apps has seen a steady growth over the past five years. In 2019, mo­bile gamers in Sin­ga­pore spent over US$332 mil­lion (S$439 mil­lion) on in-app pur­chases on games down­loaded from Ap­ple’s App Store and Google Play.</p>
    <p>That fig­ure is fore­cast to hit US$414 mil­lion for 2020, a 25 per cent year-on-year in­crease.</p>
    <p>Many mo­bile games tend to be free to down­load but en­cour­age play­ers to make small pur­chases in-game with real cash.</p>
    <p>One of the more prof­itable ways to get gamers to part with their money is loot boxes, which have ran­dom re­wards and are likened to slot ma­chines in casi­nos, with sim­i­lar lights and sounds.</p>
    <p>Gen­shin Im­pact, a free-to-down­load game with loot boxes, is estimated to have made more than US$100 mil­lion glob­ally within two weeks of its launch in Septem­ber, ri­valling the box of­fice re­ceipts for some Hol­ly­wood movies in pre-pan­demic times.</p>
    <p>Loot boxes are a huge mon­ey­mak­ing busi­ness for video games, so much so that those in sports games form a grow­ing por­tion of the rev­enue of game pub­lisher Elec­tronic Arts (EA).</p>
    <p>In fis­cal year 2017, a mode in the Fifa (foot­ball), NHL (US-Canada Na­tional Hockey League) and Mad­den (Amer­i­can foot­ball) games that con­tains loot boxes made up 16 per cent of the com­pany’s rev­enue. This grew to 21 per cent in 2018 and in 2019, it was 28 per cent, or nearly US$1.4 bil­lion of EA’s to­tal net rev­enue of about US$5 bil­lion for that year.</p>
    <p>An App An­nie spokesman said that de­spite Sin­ga­pore be­ing one of the small­est mar­kets in South­east Asia in terms of mo­bile game down­loads, it is se­cond only to Thai­land i n mo­bile game con­sumer spend­ing.</p>
    <p>“(This) makes it an at­trac­tive mar­ket for launch­ing new mo­bile game ti­tles as it has rel­a­tively higher spend­ing power and rev­enue per down­load com­pared with the rest of the re­gion,” said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>This spend­ing power was demon­strated when Gen­shin Im­pact was re­leased here.</p>
    <p>It be­came the se­cond most down­loaded game here in the first half of Oc­to­ber fol­low­ing its Sept 28 launch, while it was the top game by con­sumer spend dur­ing the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Mr Yasser Is­mail, as­so­ciate vicepres­i­dent of strat­egy for Apac at me­dia agency Essence, felt the in­crease in out­door ads was mostly driven by rev­enue from mo­bile games, which have be­come more preva­lent with tech ad­vance­ments.</p>
    <p>“The in­crease in ads is mainly based upon gam­ing con­sump­tion. Be­cause there are more gamers, game de­vel­op­ers have more bud­gets now and they can launch in­te­grated mar­ket­ing cam­paigns which do not just con­sist of dig­i­tal ads, but also aware­ness cam­paigns and out­door ad­ver­tis­ing,” said Mr Yasser.</p>
    <p>“It’s some­thing that per­haps wasn’t as preva­lent 10 years ago, as mo­bile phones didn’t have the abil­ity then to run such games.</p>
    <p>“Now any mid-tier phone can run games with good graph­ics.”</p>
    <p>Mr Yasser said the out­door ad­ver­tise­ments were likely be­ing used by game de­vel­op­ers to cre­ate aware­ness for their brand and games.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers, like Mr Lai Tuck Weng, founder of mar­ket­ing con­sul­tancy Edge Dig­i­tal, agreed, say­ing: “When it comes to out­door ad­ver</p>
    <p>tis­ing for game de­vel­op­ers, it’s not just about get­ting users to play their game, even though that is suf­fi­cient to run the busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“It is also about build­ing their brand and pres­ence; they want to make them­selves known and en­trenched in the minds of play­ers.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lai, whose firm spe­cialises in gam­ing, tech­nol­ogy and mo­bile apps, added that de­spite dig­i­tal ads be­ing more tar­geted, game de­vel­op­ers are likely mak­ing use of more out­door ads now be­cause they can af­ford to do so.</p>
    <p>A check on some ad­ver­tis­ing ser­vices’ web­sites showed that an ad­ver­tis­ing cam­paign sim­i­lar to that of Gen­shin Im­pact’s in Seran­goon could cost at least $50,000 and go above $100,000 for a dis­play of four weeks.</p>
    <p>Ms Tianyi Gu, mar­ket­ing lead for mo­bile at games and e-sports an­a­lyt­ics firm New­zoo, said that with Ap­ple phas­ing out its Iden­ti­fier for Ad­ver­tis­ers – that the com­pany at­taches to each iPhone for third par­ties to track users for ad­ver­tis­ing – game de­vel­op­ers will in­creas­ingly look for al­ter­na­tives to reach a wider au­di­ence.</p>
