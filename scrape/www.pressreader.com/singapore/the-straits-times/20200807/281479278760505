    <p>Sec­ondary 2 stu­dent Sofea Carmila Ro­haizat was dis­ap­pointed when her twice-weekly Girl Guides ses­sions came to a halt in March.</p>
    <p>“I was re­ally sad not to be able to meet my friends as a group, and we also had to put a stop to com­plet­ing some chal­lenges to earn badges,” said the 13-year-old Chua Chu Kang Sec­ondary School stu­dent.</p>
    <p>But since June, her school has held vir­tual ses­sions for all co-cur­ric­u­lar ac­tiv­i­ties (CCAs), so that stu­dents and teach­ers have a chance to meet up ev­ery week.</p>
    <p>She is also ex­plor­ing ac­tiv­i­ties she can com­plete on an on­line plat­form to achieve badges.</p>
    <p>And since the sec­ond week of last month, her school has also con­ducted en­rich­ment pro­grammes in per­son and at a class level for all Sec­ondary 1 to Sec­ondary 3 classes. The op­tions are badminton, bas­ket­ball, dance, drama, foot­ball, floor­ball, net­ball and wushu.</p>
    <p>Sofea’s class has had the chance to take part in floor­ball and badminton.</p>
    <p>“I’ve al­ways wanted to play floor­ball since pri­mary school,” she said.</p>
    <p>“It’s a way for our class to bond. It’s also an op­por­tu­nity for those of us in uni­formed groups or clubs to try out sports CCAs, and we get to learn new things.”</p>
    <p>Mr Jonathan Ram, Chua Chu</p>
    <p>Kang Sec­ondary School’s sub­ject head of phys­i­cal ed­u­ca­tion (PE) and CCAs, said: “We wanted the stu­dents to do some­thing as a class. With so many re­stric­tions on move­ment and even speak­ing to one an­other, this is one av­enue for them to let their hair down, with mea­sures in place.”</p>
    <p>Safe man­age­ment mea­sures still ap­ply. For in­stance, stu­dents have to play in fixed groups of five, and they must keep a dis­tance from one an­other dur­ing such ses­sions.</p>
    <p>Said Sofea: “Pre­vi­ously, we would play sports like dodge ball to­gether dur­ing PE lessons as a class, so it was quite hard to ad­just to the new way of play­ing, and we have to re­strain our­selves from in­ter­act­ing with one an­other.”</p>
    <p>Still, the stu­dents are glad to be with their peers, whether on­line or off­line.</p>
    <p>Sec­ondary 3 stu­dent Lee Wei Jun, 15, said his e-CCA robotics ses­sions have been a bless­ing in dis­guise.</p>
    <p>“We found new sim­u­la­tion soft­ware that we can use at home. Pre­vi­ously, we would have had to stay back in school for hours to pre­pare for com­pe­ti­tions,” he said.</p>
    <p>The ar­range­ment also means that stu­dents work in­di­vid­u­ally on their own vir­tual ro­bot, un­like be­fore when they worked in teams.</p>
    <p>“Now ev­ery­one is forced i nto think­ing of so­lu­tions them­selves and this helps to cul­ti­vate re­spon­si­bil­ity and own­er­ship,” said Wei Jun.</p>
    <p>Madam Goi Geok San, the teacher in charge of the school’s robotics CCA, said: “Be­sides the se­ri­ous pro­gram­ming tasks, I am also con­cerned about the bond­ing be­tween stu­dents and the team spirit.</p>
    <p>“So we in­ject team-build­ing games dur­ing the on­line ses­sions on Google Meet and get stu­dents to share with one an­other.”</p>
