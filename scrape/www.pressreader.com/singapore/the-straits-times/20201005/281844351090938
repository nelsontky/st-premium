    <p>LONDON • Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son does not par­tic­u­larly wish for the Brexit tran­si­tion pe­riod to end with­out a new trade deal in place but be­lieves that Bri­tain could live with such an out­come, he said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>With the Dec 31 ex­piry of the tran­si­tion pe­riod fast ap­proach­ing, Mr John­son and the head of the EU’s ex­ec­u­tive, Dr Ur­sula von der Leyen, agreed in a phone call on Satur­day to step up ne­go­ti­a­tions on a post-Brexit deal.</p>
    <p>“I think it’s there to be done,” Mr John­son said dur­ing an in­ter­view on BBC tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>“Alas, there are some dif­fi­cult is­sues that need to be fixed, and there’s no ques­tion that the EU needs to un­der­stand that we’re ut­terly se­ri­ous about need­ing to con­trol our own laws and our own reg­u­la­tions, and sim­i­larly they need to un­der­stand that the repa­tri­a­tion of the UK’s fish­eries... is very im­por­tant.”</p>
    <p>Asked whether he was wor­ried about the po­ten­tial im­pact of a nodeal sit­u­a­tion in the mid­dle of the Covid pan­demic, Mr John­son said: “I don’t want the Aus­tralian WTO­type out­come par­tic­u­larly, but we can more than live with it.”</p>
    <p>“I think the peo­ple of this coun­try have had enough... of be­ing told that this will be im­pos­si­ble or in­tol­er­a­ble. I think we can pros­per might­ily un­der those cir­cum­stances.”</p>
    <p>He was re­fer­ring to the present trad­ing re­la­tion­ship be­tween Aus­tralia and the EU, which is based on what is termed World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO)-plus rules be­cause both sides have a Mu­tual Recog­ni­tion Agree­ment in place, which im­proves ac­cess to goods. Aus­tralia and the Euro­pean Union are cur­rently ne­go­ti­at­ing a free-trade deal.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish gov­ern­ment last week told im­porters and ex­porters they would have to com­plete ex­tra pa­per­work whether there was a deal or not and that a lack of prepa­ra­tion on their part could lead to 100 km queues of trucks.</p>
    <p>That prompted ac­cu­sa­tions from the op­po­si­tion that min­is­ters were set­ting up in­dus­try to take the blame for any chaos that might fol­low a botched Brexit.</p>
    <p>The EU says that any deal must be sealed by the end of the month, or in the first days of Novem­ber at the lat­est, to leave enough time for rat­i­fi­ca­tion by the bloc be­fore the end of the year.</p>
    <p>More trade talks are due in London this week and in Brussels next be­fore the 27 na­tional EU lead­ers meet over Oct 15-16 to as­sess progress.</p>
    <p>London has also said it wants clar­ity by Oct 15 on whether a deal is pos­si­ble or not.</p>
    <p>An es­ti­mated tril­lion eu­ros (S$1.6 tril­lion) of an­nual trade would be at stake if they fail to reach an agree­ment.</p>
    <p>Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel, who meets the bloc’s chief ne­go­tia­tor Michel Barnier to­day, said last Fri­day she be­lieved a deal was still pos­si­ble, though warned the com­ing days were cru­cial.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain and Europe have so far found no way to over­come fun­da­men­tal dis­agree­ments over how to as­sign fu­ture fish­ing rights i n Bri­tish wa­ters and how to main­tain a level play­ing field in business and state sub­sidy reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the at­mos­phere has been soured by London tak­ing steps to over­turn parts of the di­vorce agree­ment struck last year, prompt­ing Brussels to launched le­gal ac­tion this week.</p>
    <p>I don’t want the Aus­tralian WTO-type out­come par­tic­u­larly, but we can more than live with it. I think the peo­ple of this coun­try have had enough ... of be­ing told that this will be im­pos­si­ble or in­tol­er­a­ble.</p>
    <p>BRI­TISH PRIME MIN­IS­TER BORIS JOHN­SON, re­fer­ring to the trad­ing ties be­tween Aus­tralia and the EU based on WTO-plus rules, where both sides have a Mu­tual Recog­ni­tion Agree­ment in place.</p>
