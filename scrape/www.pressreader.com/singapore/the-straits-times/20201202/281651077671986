    <p>House­holds should re­main pru­dent in tak­ing up new debt and in com­mit­ting to property pur­chases. When­ever pos­si­ble, they should con­tinue ser­vic­ing or con­sol­i­dat­ing their ex­ist­ing obli­ga­tions, which would be use­ful to en­hance re­silience against any un­ex­pected shocks.</p>
    <p>More fam­i­lies in Sin­ga­pore could face dif­fi­cul­ties mak­ing their home loan pay­ments in the com­ing months, warned the Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS).</p>
    <p>This is es­pe­cially since house­hold fi­nan­cial re­silience is ul­ti­mately tied to em­ploy­ment and in­come, it noted in its an­nual Fi­nan­cial Sta­bil­ity Re­view yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This risk is re­flected in the rise in the un­se­cured credit charge-off rate in the third quar­ter of this year, which sug­gests more house­holds could have prob­lems ser­vic­ing their home loans down the road.</p>
    <p>This rate crept up from 5.9 per cent to 9.1 per cent be­tween the third quar­ter of last year and the same pe­riod this year.</p>
    <p>The credit card charge-off rate is a lead­ing in­di­ca­tor of the credit qual­ity of hous­ing loans, said MAS.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause some­one in an ini­tial pe­riod of fi­nan­cial dis­tress is likely to first miss his credit card bill pay­ments, and may also not be able to pay his home loan later.</p>
    <p>MAS told The Straits Times: “On the whole, the num­ber of mort­gage de­fer­ments has ta­pered off since the peak in the se­cond quar­ter af­ter the cir­cuit breaker was lifted.” Ap­proved mort­gage relief ap­pli­ca­tions as at end-Oc­to­ber ex­ceeded 36,000.</p>
    <p>DBS Bank ap­proved some 9,000 home loan re­pay­ment relief ap­pli­ca­tions by Oc­to­ber, while OCBC Bank ap­proved more than 8,000</p>
    <p>MONE­TARY AUTHOR­ITY OF SIN­GA­PORE, on how some house­holds will face chal­lenges into next year.</p>
    <p>mort­gage, car and ren­o­va­tion loan relief ap­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>United Over­seas Bank said yes­ter­day it had close to 600 ap­pli­ca­tions for re­duced monthly in­stal­ments for con­sumer property loans un­der the Ex­tended Sup­port Scheme. This is about 8 per cent of the more than 8,000 ap­pli­ca­tions for mort­gage re­pay­ment de­fer­rals un­der the Spe­cial Fi­nan­cial Relief Pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Over­all, house­hold debt fell, as the growth in out­stand­ing home loans also de­clined, fol­low­ing cool­ing mea­sures in July 2018.</p>
    <p>Hous­ing loans ac­count for about three-quar­ters of to­tal house­hold debt, and are a key de­ter­mi­nant of over­all house­hold fi­nan­cial vul­ner­a­bil­ity, MAS noted.</p>
    <p>MAS ex­pects house­hold debt as a per­cent­age of in­come, which has re­mained sta­ble since 2015, to in­crease slightly in the near term “as ac­cu­mu­lated labour mar­ket slack weighs on wages”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, new home loans re­mained sta­ble, de­spite the sus­pen­sion of show-flat view­ings and safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Credit card debt as a per­cent­age of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct also mod­er­ated in the se­cond and third quar­ters, MAS said, as house­holds pulled back on spend­ing and con­sump­tion, and banks of­fered relief mea­sures.</p>
    <p>But MAS cau­tioned that some house­holds will con­tinue to face chal­lenges into next year.</p>
    <p>“Labour mar­ket slack rose dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic and do­mes­tic labour mar­ket con­di­tions are likely to im­prove only grad­u­ally next year,” it said, adding that the in­creased res­i­dent un­em­ploy­ment rate is ex­pected to weigh on wage growth, which will worsen house­hold debt ser­vic­ing abil­ity into next year.</p>
    <p>“House­holds should re­main pru­dent in tak­ing up new debt and in com­mit­ting to property pur­chases. When­ever pos­si­ble, they should con­tinue ser­vic­ing or con­sol­i­dat­ing their ex­ist­ing obli­ga­tions, which would be use­ful to en­hance re­silience against any un­ex­pected shocks.”</p>
