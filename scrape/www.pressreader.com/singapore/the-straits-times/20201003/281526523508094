    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans can ex­pect to move into phase three in a cal­i­brated and cau­tious man­ner, in the same way as how re­stric­tions are be­ing eased in the dif­fer­ent stages of the cur­rent phase two, ex­perts said. They see the blurred bound­aries be­tween the two phases as a good ap­proach, as changes are more likely to be ac­cepted when in­tro­duced in­cre­men­tally and grad­u­ally.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans can ex­pect to move into phase three re­open­ing in a cal­i­brated and cau­tious man­ner, in the same way re­stric­tions are be­ing eased in the dif­fer­ent stages of the cur­rent phase two, ex­perts told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>But they see the blurred bound­aries be­tween the two phases as a good ap­proach.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Josip Car, di­rec­tor of the Cen­tre for Pop­u­la­tion Health Sciences at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, said this lack of a clear-cut dif­fer­ence shows ef­fec­tive pol­i­cy­mak­ing in ac­tion, as changes are more likely to be ac­cepted when in­tro­duced in­cre­men­tally and grad­u­ally, help­ing to en­sure that the pub­lic un­der­stands the mea­sures and re­mains calm.</p>
    <p>Pan­demic re­sponse plan­ning goes be­yond just a “head­line name”, Prof Car said.</p>
    <p>“There is a lot of ef­fort given to de­tail about the kind of mea­sures put in place be­tween the phases, but more im­por­tantly, it is also about the wider strate­gies to achieve the best out­comes.”</p>
    <p>Phase two re­open­ing of the Sin­ga­pore econ­omy came into force on June 19, which, among other things, al­lows most busi­nesses and so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties to re­sume, with safe­guards in place.</p>
    <p>WHAT PHASE THREE COULD BE</p>
    <p>With fur­ther eas­ing of re­stric­tions in the past few weeks, such as dou­bling the num­ber of peo­ple at wed­dings and the lift­ing of bor­der re­stric­tions to vis­i­tors from Aus­tralia – ex­clud­ing Vic­to­ria state – and Viet­nam, many have won­dered if Sin­ga­pore has un­of­fi­cially entered phase three.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Alex Cook, vice-dean of re­search at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, how­ever, cau­tioned that it would be “silly” to give each of these in­cre­men­tal changes a name, as­sert­ing that Sin­ga­pore­ans can­not ex­pect to be back to nor­mal en­tirely un­til mass vac­ci­na­tion begins.</p>
    <p>“In­stead, we are call­ing the big over­all phases as one, two and three, like sign­posts that we have reached ma­jor stag­ing points in our jour­ney. Care­ful re­lax­ation is nec­es­sary as coun­tries that have rushed into re­open­ing are en­ter­ing sec­ond waves, and ei­ther start­ing lo­calised lock­downs, in the case of Spain and Bri­tain, or full na­tional lock­downs, like Is­rael,” he said.</p>
    <p>Tem­per­ing pub­lic ex­pec­ta­tions, Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, said that one should not an­tic­i­pate a sig­nif­i­cant re­lax­ing of mea­sures in phase three, and ex­pect the en­tire suite of ac­tiv­i­ties that were pre­vi­ously barred to re­turn.</p>
    <p>Rather, phase three is a state in which Sin­ga­pore will re­main with a cer­tain de­gree of pre­cau­tions to al­low eco­nomic and so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties to carry on.</p>
    <p>“We al­ways have to con­sider the im­pact of a pos­si­ble su­per­spreader event, and whether the al­lowed ac­tiv­i­ties will sub­stan­tially am­plify this spread. This is the lens I hope we will use to de­ter­mine Sin­ga­pore’s sta­ble state,” Prof Teo cau­tioned.</p>
    <p>But he re­mains op­ti­mistic about travel, and is for un­re­stricted travel to re­sume, es­pe­cially to places where the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion is very sim­i­lar to or bet­ter than Sin­ga­pore’s.</p>
    <p>“Non-ex­haus­tive ex­am­ples in­clude New Zealand, Brunei, Viet­nam, Hong Kong, Tai­wan and Thai­land. Of course, this list can­not be static and needs to be reg­u­larly re­viewed and up­dated,” he said.</p>
    <p>With much still un­known about the coro­n­avirus, phase three would also de­pend on the ex­tent of sci­en­tific and med­i­cal ad­vances, when the time for fur­ther re­open­ing comes.</p>
    <p>Prof Car ex­plained: “As more busi­nesses adapt and cre­ate new ways of op­er­at­ing, work­ers adapt to new modes of work­ing, re­search is ramped up and new tech­nolo­gies evolve to pre­vent, de­tect, di­ag­nose and treat the dis­ease... we will then know what our new nor­mal – or phase three – would look like.”</p>
    <p>He called for so­ci­ety to be re­silient and nim­ble, to be able to trans­form and adapt, de­pend­ing on the threats, ther­a­peu­tics and knowl­edge that are avail­able at that time, cit­ing as an ex­am­ple, the re­lax­ation on young chil­dren wear­ing masks last month fol­low­ing a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of the virus.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Paul Tam­byah, pres­i­dent of the Asia-Pa­cific So­ci­ety of Clin­i­cal Mi­cro­bi­ol­ogy and In­fec­tion, said that pol­icy de­ci­sions guid­ing the na­ture of phase three should take into con­sid­er­a­tion sci­ence and medicine, and the big­ger pic­ture.</p>
    <p>“There has to be a bal­ance be­tween health risks and that of so­cial iso­la­tion ver­sus the ben­e­fits of pre­vent­ing trans­mis­sion of in­fec­tion. Per­son­ally, I think a lot of peo­ple would like larger fam­ily gath­er­ings to be al­lowed, and the risks could be mit­i­gated with ef­fec­tive con­tact trac­ing,” Prof Tam­byah said.</p>
    <p>As part of the lat­est round of pan­demic re­stric­tions eas­ing, live mu­sic dur­ing wor­ship ser­vices will re­sume, which Prof Tam­byah said would also help to stress test the sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“If these go off well, then per­haps that can be ex­panded to con­certs and the the­atre. Cin­e­mas and re­li­gious wor­ship ser­vices have opened to pro­gres­sively larger crowds with­out any prob­lems re­ported, so hope­fully the same will be ex­tended to con­certs, the­atres and sport­ing events.”</p>
    <p>RE­TURN OF NIGHTLIFE?</p>
    <p>But scenes of late-night mer­ry­mak­ing at night­clubs, pubs and bars will likely have to wait even af­ter Sin­ga­pore en­ters phase three, ex­perts said.</p>
    <p>Prof Teo said that since these ac­tiv­i­ties take place in en­closed spa­ces, crowded set­tings and with ex­po­sure to close con­tacts for a long du­ra­tion, they are con­sid­ered very high risk and should not be per­mit­ted re­gard­less of the phases.</p>
    <p>“What we saw in New Zealand, Vic­to­ria state in Aus­tralia, Hong Kong and Viet­nam serve as stark re­minders that, even when there are ex­tended pe­ri­ods of zero com­mu­nity cases, the sit­u­a­tion can de­te­ri­o­rate rapidly within a cou­ple of weeks... How rapid this de­te­ri­o­ra­tion is re­ally de­pends on the range of ac­tiv­i­ties that are al­lowed,” Prof Teo cau­tioned.</p>
    <p>“I do think if nightlife ac­tiv­i­ties re­sume, very care­ful eval­u­a­tion of the safe man­age­ment pro­ce­dures must be in place, es­pe­cially to en­sure that con­tact trac­ing can hap­pen seam­lessly, and to prop­erly en­force the ex­e­cu­tion of these mea­sures.”</p>
    <p>DORSCON ORANGE</p>
    <p>Prof Teo noted that Sin­ga­pore has been in Dis­ease Out­break Re­sponse Sys­tem Con­di­tion (Dorscon) Orange since Feb 7, although the cur­rent rules and reg­u­la­tions are much more nu­anced, with dif­fer­ent ac­tiv­i­ties for dif­fer­ent lev­els of risk.</p>
    <p>He stressed the im­por­tance of clear com­mu­ni­ca­tion to in­form in­di­vid­u­als on what they need to do to pro­tect them­selves and the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Prof Cook sug­gested that the Dorscon frame­work would also likely have to be up­dated and re­assessed af­ter the pan­demic has sub­sided as there seems to be “a mis­match be­tween the risks and re­sponses en­vi­sioned in the Dorscon frame­work and what ac­tu­ally hap­pened.”</p>
    <p>What we saw in New Zealand, Vic­to­ria state in Aus­tralia, Hong Kong and Viet­nam serve as stark re­minders that, even when there are ex­tended pe­ri­ods of zero com­mu­nity cases, the sit­u­a­tion can de­te­ri­o­rate rapidly within a cou­ple of weeks... How rapid this de­te­ri­o­ra­tion is re­ally de­pends on the range of ac­tiv­i­ties that are al­lowed.</p>
