    <p>ORLANDO • The first week of the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion’s (NBA) “bub­ble” plan to keep its teams safe from the coro­n­avirus has proved suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>The league and play­ers’ union an­nounced on Mon­day that only two play­ers among the 322 tested since ar­riv­ing on July 7 at the Dis­ney World Re­sort in Orlando, Florida were found to have con­tracted the Covid-19 dis­ease.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment said that the two in­fected play­ers “never cleared quar­an­tine and have since left the cam­pus to iso­late at home or in iso­la­tion hous­ing”.</p>
    <p>It added that an­other 19 play­ers had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 dur­ing in-mar­ket test­ing that be­gan on July 1 be­fore teams headed to the re­sort.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the NBA and the play­ers’ union, “these play­ers are stay­ing in their home mar­kets and re­cov­er­ing un­til they are cleared un­der Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion guide­lines and NBA rules for leav­ing home iso­la­tion and join­ing the cam­pus”.</p>
    <p>One of those play­ers is Hous­ton Rock­ets star and 2017 Most Valu­able Player Russell West­brook.</p>
    <p>Said the guard on his In­sta­gram ac­count on Mon­day: “I’m cur­rently feel­ing well, quar­an­tined, and look­ing for­ward to re­join­ing my team­mates when I am cleared. Please take this virus se­ri­ously. Be safe. Mask up.”</p>
    <p>It is un­clear when he will be able to join the Rock­ets for train­ing camp, with the sea­son set to re­sume on July 30, as it is not known when his quar­an­tine pe­riod be­gan.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the NBA’s guide­book on health pro­to­cols, he will be al­lowed to en­ter the “bub­ble” when he tests neg­a­tively for Covid-19 in two sep­a­rate tests at least 24 hours apart.</p>
    <p>The 31-year-old must also be cleared by a league-ap­proved in­fec­tious dis­ease physi­cian and un­dergo a car­diac screen­ing.</p>
    <p>The pos­i­tive test rate of 0.6 per cent, with all cases not oc­cur­ring within the “bub­ble”, does show the NBA is largely suc­ceed­ing in keep­ing its play­ers iso­lated from the out­break that is grip­ping Florida.</p>
    <p>The state re­ported a record 15,299 new Covid-19 cases on Sun­day – the high­est mark pro­duced in any Amer­i­can state at any point since the pan­demic’s out­set in March – and the num­bers only dipped to 12,624 new cases on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>But as the ESPN Wide World of Sports com­plex – which is where the rest of the reg­u­lar sea­son and play-offs will be staged – has been closed off to the pub­lic with strict safety mea­sures im­posed, NBA com­mis­sioner Adam Sil­ver be­lieves play­ers and staff will be safer in the “bub­ble” than else­where.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he is not tak­ing any chances, telling For­tune mag­a­zine: “What would be most con­cern­ing is once play­ers en­ter this cam­pus and then go through our quar­an­tine pe­riod, then if they were to test pos­i­tive or if we had any pos­i­tive tests, we would know we would have an issue.”</p>
    <p>As such, the league an­nounced on Mon­day that two play­ers, Hous­ton for­ward Bruno Cabo­clo and Sacra­mento Kings cen­tre Richaun Holmes, had been given an ad­di­tional 10 days of self-quar­an­tine af­ter ex­it­ing the “bub­ble” with­out per­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Holmes re­port­edly went to pick up a food de­liv­ery, while Cabo­clo left his ho­tel room even though he was sup­posed to be con­fined.</p>
