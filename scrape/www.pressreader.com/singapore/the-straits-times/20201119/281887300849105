    <p>There may have been re­lief in China’s rul­ing cir­cles when Mr Joe Bi­den won the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in the United States, even though Bei­jing took nearly a week to con­grat­u­late the Pres­i­den­t­elect. Chi­nese ne­ti­zens cer­tainly cel­e­brated on so­cial me­dia, re­nam­ing Bei­jing’s iconic For­bid­den City the “For-Bi­den City”. After a four-year roller-coaster ride with Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, whose un­pre­dictable for­eign pol­icy and con­fronta­tional ways reg­u­larly pushed the two sides close to con­flict, Bei­jing is pre­par­ing for change. So too else­where, it would ap­pear, par­tic­u­larly in Europe and Asia where some coun­tries found them­selves squeezed un­com­fort­ably as ri­valry and ten­sions be­tween the two pow­ers es­ca­lated.</p>
    <p>For China, and the rest of the world, Mr Bi­den’s win – which still needs to be for­mally de­clared – pro­vides op­por­tu­ni­ties for a change of course or to re­set re­la­tions that have hit their low­est point in decades. The wors­en­ing of ties be­tween the world’s two largest economies has had huge im­pli­ca­tions bi­lat­er­ally and for the rest of the world, af­fect­ing not just the in­ter­na­tional re­sponse to the Covid-19 pan­demic and is­sues like cli­mate change, but also global peace and sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>There has been no paucity of views about what a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion must do to put the re­la­tion­ship back on a steady course, even as both sides con­tinue to hold dif­fer­ing views and com­pete on the in­ter­na­tional stage. Go­ing by what for­mer lead­ers in­clud­ing Bri­tain’s Mr Tony Blair, and Mr Bill Clin­ton and Dr Henry Kissinger of the US have said, both sides need to have a clear un­der­stand­ing and ap­pre­ci­a­tion of each other’s po­si­tions, engage in con­struc­tive dis­cus­sions and find a ba­sis for co­op­er­a­tion or risk dam­ag­ing con­flict. But there should be no il­lu­sion about how much Mr Bi­den can re­ally achieve in the next four years to mend ties with China.</p>
    <p>His im­me­di­ate fo­cus would be do­mes­tic: heal­ing deep di­vides in US so­ci­ety, tam­ing an out-of­con­trol pan­demic, and boost­ing a flag­ging econ­omy. Anti-China sen­ti­ment in the US, which cuts across party af­fil­i­a­tions, will also con­strain him. As for trade, Mr Bi­den is no less pro­tec­tion­ist than Mr Trump, even if he might go about pro­tect­ing jobs in less con­fronta­tional ways. Still, he can be ex­pected to be less com­bat­ive than Mr Trump and less im­pul­sive, bring­ing a mea­sure of calm to the re­la­tion­ship. He is likely to turn to di­a­logue on is­sues – a hall­mark of the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion where he was vice-pres­i­dent – and em­brace mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism. These will help sta­bilise ties. With Mr Bi­den plan­ning to re-en­ter the Paris Agree­ment and World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion, there should be im­proved co­op­er­a­tion through these bod­ies. While the world should not ex­pect a ma­jor re­set of this most crit­i­cal of bi­lat­eral re­la­tion­ships, it could be in a bet­ter place four years from now, and that would be rea­son to cheer.</p>
