    <p>About 5 per cent of avail­able vac­cine stocks at any point in time should be set aside for peo­ple work­ing in ar­eas crit­i­cal to Sin­ga­pore’s func­tion­ing, said a top-level com­mit­tee on vac­cines yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ex­am­ples in­clude those in­volved in en­sur­ing the coun­try’s wa­ter and util­i­ties and other “na­tion­ally es­sen­tial ser­vices” are not dis­rupted.</p>
    <p>This was among the key rec­om­men­da­tions made by the ex­pert com­mit­tee on Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion, which was tasked by the Min­istry of Health (MOH) in Oc­to­ber to de­vise a vac­cine strat­egy for Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>MOH yes­ter­day said the Gov­ern­ment has ac­cepted the com­mit­tee’s rec­om­men­da­tions in full, adding that Sin­ga­pore’s vac­ci­na­tion ex­er­cise will be­gin on Wed­nes­day for work­ers at the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Diseases.</p>
    <p>The com­mit­tee said those in­volved in crit­i­cal work should be pro­tected from Covid-19 for “greater so­ci­etal ben­e­fits”, although iden­ti­fy­ing th­ese groups was be­yond the re­mit of the com­mit­tee and will be left to the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Other groups are be­ing pri­ori­tised for vac­ci­na­tion for rea­sons of pub­lic health, and they in­clude the el­derly – es­pe­cially those aged 70 and above who are at greater risk of worse health out­comes if they con­tract the virus – as well as health­care work­ers and those work­ing on the front line of the na­tional Covid-19 re­sponse.</p>
    <p>In rec­om­mend­ing such work­ers to be pri­ori­tised, the com­mit­tee said there is a duty to pro­tect those who place them­selves at higher risk of in­fec­tion in the course of car­ing for the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Other rec­om­men­da­tions by the com­mit­tee in­clude vac­ci­nat­ing ev­ery­one in Sin­ga­pore who is med­i­cally el­i­gi­ble as more vac­cines be­come avail­able, and con­tin­u­ing to prac­tise safe man­age­ment mea­sures un­til more peo­ple are vac­ci­nated and more data on vac­cines’ abil­ity to pre­vent in­fec­tions be­comes avail­able.</p>
    <p>In its re­port to the Gov­ern­ment, the com­mit­tee said that while pub­lic health mea­sures have been shown to be ef­fec­tive in con­tain­ing out­breaks, the “fun­da­men­tal chal­lenge” is that the vast ma­jor­ity of peo­ple here and in the world do not have any im­mu­nity to the virus.</p>
    <p>“The devel­op­ment and avail­abil­ity of ef­fec­tive Covid-19 vac­cines is a crit­i­cally im­por­tant mile­stone, pro­vid­ing the means to fun­da­men­tally con­tain the pan­demic, di­min­ish its im­pact in terms of mor­bid­ity and deaths from in­fec­tion, and even­tu­ally al­low so­ci­eties to re­turn to nor­malcy,” the re­port added.</p>
    <p>The ul­ti­mate goal of its vac­ci­na­tion strat­egy against Covid-19, it said, is to achieve as high a level of pop­u­la­tion cov­er­age as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>The com­mit­tee noted that Sin­ga­pore cur­rently has a low rate of trans­mis­sion, but the threat of an out­break per­sists as the global pan­demic in­ten­si­fies and the coun­try re­sumes more ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The Re­pub­lic re­mains vul­ner­a­ble to the dis­ease and its spread, with the coun­try’s high pop­u­la­tion den­sity and sig­nif­i­cant pro­por­tion of older peo­ple, said the re­port, adding that there is great value in vac­ci­nat­ing the pop­u­la­tion widely to pre-emp­tively pro­tect against the risk of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>While the Health Sci­ences Au­thor­ity’s clin­i­cal as­sess­ment of the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine found it to have a high ef­fi­cacy of 95 per cent, with no sig­nif­i­cant safety con­cerns de­tected so far, con­tin­ued mon­i­tor­ing for long-term ef­fi­cacy of the vac­cine will be needed to de­ter­mine the du­ra­tion of pro­tec­tion, as well as for rare and se­ri­ous ad­verse ef­fects, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>As more vac­cines be­come avail­able, the com­mit­tee will make fur­ther rec­om­men­da­tions on other groups to be pri­ori­tised, such as those who live or work in set­tings where there is po­ten­tial for rapid trans­mis­sion and large out­breaks.</p>
