    <p>The Chi­nese con­sulate in Hous­ton, Texas, was closed down to dis­rupt the es­pi­onage and in­flu­ence ac­tiv­i­ties be­ing run out of it, which rose to a level that threat­ened the United States’ na­tional se­cu­rity, se­nior Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>In a brief­ing for re­porters on Fri­day, they laid out the most com­pre­hen­sive set of al­le­ga­tions of the con­sulate’s il­le­gal ac­tiv­i­ties since it had been or­dered to close on Tues­day, adding that other Chi­nese con­sulates in the US also en­gaged in sim­i­lar be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>The Hous­ton con­sulate was im­pli­cated in an in­ves­ti­ga­tion of grant fraud in a Texas re­search in­sti­tu­tion, with con­sulate of­fi­cials di­rectly in­volved in com­mu­ni­ca­tions with re­searchers and guid­ing them on what in­for­ma­tion to col­lect, said a se­nior Jus­tice De­part­ment of­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>The Hous­ton con­sulate, along with other Chi­nese con­sulates in the US, also pro­moted in­ter­na­tional talent re­cruit­ment pro­grammes, which can cre­ate in­cen­tives to steal in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty and cre­ate con­flicts of in­ter­est, the of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>He cited the con­vic­tion of Hous­ton busi­ness­man Shan Shi of trade se­cret theft in July last year.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese-Amer­i­can busi­ness­man had es­tab­lished a sub­sidiary of a Chi­nese firm and poached lo­cal talent as well as trade se­crets from a lo­cal busi­ness to de­velop syn­tac­tic foam. The buoy­ancy ma­te­rial helps keep off­shore oil and gas drilling equip­ment afloat and is tech­nol­ogy that China wants to be self-suf­fi­cient in, said the of­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>“The sum to­tal of the Hous­ton con­sulate’s ac­tiv­i­ties went well over the line of what we were will­ing to ac­cept, and un­less we dis­rupted it, it threat­ened to be­come even more ag­gres­sive in Hous­ton and at other Chi­nese con­sulates na­tion­wide,” said the of­fi­cial, speak­ing on con­di­tion of anonymity.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion on Tues­day or­dered the clo­sure of the Hous­ton con­sulate, one of China’s six diplo­matic mis­sions in the US in­clud­ing its em­bassy in Wash­ing­ton, plac­ing it at the cen­tre of the lat­est diplo­matic firestorm and es­ca­la­tion of US-China ten­sions.</p>
    <p>Diplo­mats were given 72 hours to va­cate the premises, a dead­line that ex­pired on Fri­day, lo­cal time.</p>
    <p>China re­sponded by an­nounc­ing the clos­ing of the Amer­i­can con­sulate in Chengdu on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>At the brief­ing, the of­fi­cials said Hous­ton and other con­sulates were also bases of op­er­a­tion for China’s Op­er­a­tion Fox Hunt agents sent from China to co­erce Chi­nese dis­si­dents and refugees to re­turn to main­land China.</p>
    <p>In one in­stance, a Hous­ton con­sulate rep­re­sen­ta­tive de­liv­ered a let­ter to a per­son in the South, al­legedly from his fa­ther, im­plor­ing him to re­turn to China.</p>
    <p>“The folks in Hous­ton were very much ac­tive par­tic­i­pants in all the var­i­ous ef­forts of col­lec­tion and in­flu­ence that the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment, the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party, is do­ing here in the US,” said a Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion of­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>Con­sulates also enable the di­rect lob­by­ing of state lo­cal of­fi­cials as well as busi­ness peo­ple to favour Chi­nese in­ter­ests, said of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>“While that’s to be ex­pected of diplo­mats, when it takes a turn to­wards the co­er­cive or covert, that be­comes a na­tional se­cu­rity prob­lem,” said an of­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>Con­sulates were also sus­pected to run net­works of watch­ers on school cam­puses that re­port on fel­low stu­dents, un­der­min­ing the free­dom of ex­pres­sion that stu­dents on Amer­i­can cam­puses were en­ti­tled to, he added.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials said that they would not nec­es­sar­ily pros­e­cute con­sulate staff, as they en­joyed diplo­matic im­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>An of­fi­cial said the clo­sure of the Hous­ton con­sulate – “one of the worst of­fend­ers” – was meant to send a mes­sage to re­main­ing of­fi­cials in other Chi­nese con­sulates to stop their il­le­gal ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think you can point to one mo­ment that was the straw that broke the camel’s back. It was an in­crease in ma­lign ac­tiv­ity over time and, at some point, you say enough is enough,” he said.</p>
