    <p>LIS­BON • Last sea­son, Manch­ester City were de­nied a spot in the Cham­pi­ons League semi-fi­nals after Ra­heem Ster­ling’s late strike against Tot­ten­ham was ruled out by the video as­sis­tant ref­eree (VAR).</p>
    <p>On Satur­day, VAR again played a part, but there was also the fa­mil­iar cock­tail of de­fen­sive howlers and missed chances that pre­vented them from win­ning more than the League Cup this term.</p>
    <p>After crash­ing out in the quar­ter­fi­nals for the third straight sea­son, go­ing down 3-1 to Lyon in Lis­bon, City man­ager Pep Guardi­ola ad­mit­ted that his team were their own worst en­emy, with the Spa­niard yet to get be­yond the last eight in his four years at the Eti­had.</p>
    <p>De­spite City be­com­ing foot­ball’s first bil­lion-dol­lar team since the Abu Dhabi takeover in 2008, it will come as a mas­sive dis­ap­point­ment to their own­ers that not only have they again missed out on an op­por­tu­nity to win their maiden Euro­pean Cup, but also make it to the semi-fi­nals for just the sec­ond time after their first ap­pear­ance in 2016.</p>
    <p>Lament­ing City’s fail­ings, Guardi­ola said: “One day, we’ll break this gap to the quar­ter-fi­nals. You have to be per­fect in these com­pe­ti­tions in one game and we weren’t.”</p>
    <p>City looked dis­jointed from the start after the 49-year-old opted to go with three cen­tral de­fend­ers, in­clud­ing full-back Kyle Walker.</p>
    <p>The Eng­land in­ter­na­tional was caught out of po­si­tion as Karl Toko Ekambi was played on­side and the loose ball fell to Maxwel Cor­net, who curled home the opener for his fourth goal against City in three games.</p>
    <p>Guardi­ola’s men upped the pres­sure in the sec­ond half, lead­ing to Kevin de Bruyne’s equaliser, but sub­sti­tute Moussa Dem­bele’s strike to re­store the French Ligue 1 side’s lead was al­lowed to stand de­spite a VAR check for a trip on Aymeric La­porte.</p>
    <p>Ster­ling then in­cred­i­bly fired over with the goal gap­ing late on and the next piece of ac­tion saw Eder­son fum­ble a rou­tine shot by Houssem Aouar, al­low­ing Dem­bele to grab his dou­ble and knock City out.</p>
    <p>La­porte was in­censed later, ref­er­enc­ing a claim by pun­dit Rio Fer­di­nand that he had been fouled and tweet­ing: “Just to be clear, I will not hide, I’m a foot­ball player but a man fore­most... this de­ci­sion is hard to ac­cept, es­pe­cially in a cru­cial qual­i­fier and with the help of VAR.”</p>
    <p>Nei­ther Guardi­ola nor de Bruyne wished to dwell on the VAR call or Ster­ling’s glar­ing miss, al­though the for­mer Barcelona coach in­sisted that his tac­tics had been spot on de­spite crit­i­cism of his tin­ker­ing.</p>
    <p>“In this com­pe­ti­tion, the tac­tics are not the most im­por­tant thing,” he told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“They (Lyon) are so fast and our cen­tral de­fend­ers are not so quick, so I didn’t want to leave them two ver­sus two.</p>
    <p>“We worked for three days on this, we dis­cussed it and we re­viewed this and when you play like we did in the last 20 min­utes, it shows the sys­tem is not the prob­lem.</p>
    <p>One day, we’ll break this gap to the quar­ter-fi­nals. You have to be per­fect in these com­pe­ti­tions in one game and we weren’t.</p>
    <p>THIRD TIME’S NOT A CHARM</p>
    <p>Dif­fer­ent year, same stuff. We need to learn, it’s not good enough.</p>
    <p>“This com­pe­ti­tion is that sit­u­a­tion. You have to equalise and go to ex­tra time and after, we con­cede the third goal.</p>
    <p>“We cre­ate more chances, so we did every­thing but un­for­tu­nately, we are out again.”</p>
    <p>De Bruyne, who yes­ter­day was named the Premier League Player of the Sea­son for record­ing 20 as­sists to equal for­mer Arse­nal striker Thierry Henry’s record in 2003, ad­mit­ted that City would need to take a hard look at them­selves after their lat­est heart­break.</p>
    <p>“I’m not go­ing to blame (VAR), I think we should have done bet­ter,” the Bel­gium mid­fielder told BT Sport.</p>
    <p>“Dif­fer­ent year, same stuff. We need to learn, it’s not good enough.”</p>
    <p>PEP GUARDI­OLA, City man­ager, after a third straight Cham­pi­ons League quar­ter-fi­nal exit.</p>
    <p>AN­OTHER LES­SON</p>
    <p>KEVIN DE BRUYNE, City mid­fielder, also re­fus­ing to blame VAR.</p>

Ster&#xAD;ling missed an open goal from five yards be&#xAD;fore Lyon grabbed their third 59 sec&#xAD;onds later. There will be no semi-fi&#xAD;nal&#xAD;ists from Eng&#xAD;land, Spain or Italy for the first time since 1991.</p>
