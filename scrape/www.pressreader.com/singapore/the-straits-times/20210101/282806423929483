    <p>J-pop idol Tsuyoshi Ku­sanagi, a member of the now-de­funct boy band Smap, is of­fi­cially mar­ried, the se­cond member of the pop­u­lar boy band to tie the knot.</p>
    <p>Ku­sanagi, 46, an­nounced through his agency on Wed­nes­day that he had reg­is­tered his mar­riage that day.</p>
    <p>The agency said he will not dis­close the iden­tity of his wife as she is not from the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try and added that she is not preg­nant.</p>
    <p>Ku­sanagi’s big day fell on the same day as his pet dog Ku­rumi’s fourth birthday.</p>
    <p>The singer-ac­tor later re­leased a state­ment, say­ing he would con­tinue with his act­ing ca­reer af­ter mar­riage and hoped his fans would con­tinue to sup­port him.</p>
    <p>Many fans con­grat­u­lated him af­ter the an­nounce­ment. His former band mates – Takuya Kimura, 48, Shingo Ka­tori, 43, Goro Inagaki, 47, and Masahiro Nakai, 48 – also sent their good wishes.</p>
    <p>For a long time, Kimura was the only Smap member to be mar­ried, as their agency Johnny & As­so­ci­ates has strict rules on dat­ing.</p>
    <p>He has been mar­ried to singer</p>
    <p>Shizuka Kudo, 50, since 2000, and they have two daugh­ters – mod­els Co­comi, 19, and Koki, 17.</p>
    <p>Smap, which stands for “Sports Mu­sic As­sem­ble Peo­ple”, de­buted in 1988 and have churned out chart-top­ping hits such as Lion Heart and The One And Only Flower In The World.</p>
    <p>They also had chart-top­ping tele­vi­sion shows, in­di­vid­u­ally and as a group.</p>
    <p>Ku­sanagi, Ka­tori and Inagaki left Johnny & As­so­ci­ates af­ter their con­tract ended and formed a new group, Atarashii Chizu, which means “new map” in Ja­panese.</p>
