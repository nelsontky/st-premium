    <p>KARACHI • An anti-graft court in Pak­istan has in­dicted for­mer pres­i­dent Asif Ali Zar­dari and de­clared for­mer premier Nawaz Sharif an ab­scon­der in cor­rup­tion cases, the lat­est move in mul­ti­ple le­gal pro­ceed­ings against the po­lit­i­cal op­po­nents of Prime Min­is­ter Im­ran Khan.</p>
    <p>An ac­count­abil­ity court judge, Judge Syed As­ghar Ali, framed charges against Zar­dari, the cochair­man of the op­po­si­tion Pak­istan Peo­ples Party, for il­le­gally ac­cept­ing gifts from for­eign rulers when he was the pres­i­dent from 2008 to 2013, a deputy pros­e­cu­tor of the Na­tional Ac­count­abil­ity Bu­reau said on the phone.</p>
    <p>In the same case, Sharif was de­clared an ab­scon­der.</p>
    <p>Both the lead­ers are on bail in other cor­rup­tion cases.</p>
    <p>Sharif, who was the South Asian na­tion’s premier from 2013 to 2017 and was jailed in a cor­rup­tion case in 2018, has been in Lon­don for about nine months seek­ing med­i­cal treat­ment.</p>
    <p>Pak­istan had writ­ten to the Bri­tish au­thor­i­ties ear­lier this year to seek the re­turn of Sharif, who flew to Lon­don af­ter a court granted him in­def­i­nite bail on med­i­cal grounds. Sharif was serv­ing a seven-year jail term be­fore be­ing granted bail.</p>
    <p>Pak­istan can­not seek his ex­tra­di­tion be­cause it has no ex­tra­di­tion treaty with Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>There is a lot of scep­ti­cism among le­gal and po­lit­i­cal ex­perts about the way Sharif’s trial was con­ducted, and most think Pak­istan’s pow­er­ful mil­i­tary might have col­luded with the ju­di­ciary to side­line a pop­u­lar leader. Sharif, known as an ad­vo­cate for civil­ian supremacy in a coun­try ruled by gen­er­als for decades, had rough re­la­tions with the mil­i­tary and the ju­di­ciary.</p>
    <p>Zar­dari be­came pres­i­dent in 2008 af­ter Pak­istan’s for­mer mil­i­tary dic­ta­tor Pervez Mushar­raf was forced to re­sign. Zar­dari’s wife Be­nazir Bhutto served twice as prime min­is­ter be­fore be­ing killed by the Tale­ban in 2007.</p>
    <p>Last month, the ac­count­abil­ity court for­mally framed sep­a­rate charges against Zar­dari for buy­ing as­sets over­seas from un­de­clared sources. He was ac­cused of hav­ing dozens of bo­gus bank ac­counts – a charge he de­nies.</p>
    <p>The in­dict­ments are the lat­est in a string of le­gal pro­ceed­ings against Mr Khan’s po­lit­i­cal op­po­nents.</p>
    <p>Since com­ing to power, Mr Khan has pledged that his gov­ern­ment would make good on his elec­tion cam­paign prom­ise to fight cor­rup­tion on all fronts. Op­po­si­tion par­ties ac­cuse the gov­ern­ment of per­se­cu­tion.</p>
    <p>Pak­istan’s anti-graft body has ar­rested sev­eral politi­cians and busi­ness­men on cor­rup­tion charges since Mr Khan took of­fice in 2018 af­ter win­ning a nar­row ma­jor­ity in par­lia­men­tary elec­tions.</p>
