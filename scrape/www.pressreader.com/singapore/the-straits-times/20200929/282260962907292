    <p>Ten­nis play­ers ar­riv­ing for tour­na­ments in Aus­tralia may be able to com­pete dur­ing their manda­tory two-week coro­n­avirus quar­an­tine, the coun­try’s ten­nis chief has said.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s strict virus bor­der con­trols re­quire in­ter­na­tional ar­rivals to spend 14 days in ho­tel quar­an­tine, with most non-cit­i­zens shut out al­to­gether. But in a let­ter to play­ers, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Craig Ti­ley said Ten­nis Aus­tralia was work­ing with the gov­ern­ment to en­sure all play­ers would be able to train dur­ing the iso­la­tion pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia usu­ally stages a num­ber of ten­nis tour­na­ments in Jan­uary, cul­mi­nat­ing in the Aus­tralian Open, which is the first Grand Slam of the year.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tinue to keep you up­dated on any changes, in­clud­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of be­ing able to com­pete dur­ing the two-week pe­riod,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>Quar­an­tine hubs for play­ers will be es­tab­lished across “a num­ber” of Aus­tralian cities from early De­cem­ber, Ti­ley added.</p>
    <p>Mel­bourne, which is due to host the Aus­tralian Open from Jan 18-31, has been in lock­down since early July to curb a sec­ond wave of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Some re­stric­tions, in­clud­ing an overnight cur­few, were eased yes­ter­day as new case numbers in the whole coun­try fell to sin­gle dig­its for the first time since mid-June.</p>
    <p>Ti­ley’s let­ter was re­vealed by Slo­vak player Lukas Lacko, who tweeted the Open “will be fun I guess”.</p>
    <p>Ten­nis Aus­tralia said in a state­ment that it was in­volved in “pro­duc­tive dis­cus­sions” about quar­an­tine for play­ers.</p>
    <p>Ti­ley told the play­ers that the ten­nis sched­ule was still be­ing fi­nalised, but of­fi­cials hoped to pro­vide “more op­por­tu­ni­ties” for play­ers to com­pete dur­ing the tra­di­tional four-week pe­riod in Aus­tralia. He en­cour­aged play­ers to ar­rive be­fore Dec 14 and said Ten­nis Aus­tralia was ne­go­ti­at­ing with com­mer­cial air­lines to en­sure enough flights would be avail­able.</p>
    <p>This year’s Aus­tralian Open build-up events included the ATP Cup men’s team com­pe­ti­tion and women’s tour­na­ments in Bris­bane, Ho­bart and Ade­laide.</p>
