    <p>Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia have fi­nalised ar­range­ments for long-term pass hold­ers and trav­ellers on es­sen­tial or of­fi­cial busi­ness to cross the bor­der – ap­pli­ca­tions for which will kick off on Aug 10. Op­er­a­tional de­tails of the re­cip­ro­cal green lane and pe­ri­odic com­mut­ing ar­range­ment will be pub­lished in the next few days.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia have fi­nalised ar­range­ments for longterm pass hold­ers and trav­ellers on es­sen­tial or of­fi­cial busi­ness to cross the bor­der – ap­pli­ca­tions for which will kick off on Aug 10, For­eign Min­is­ter Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Op­er­a­tional de­tails of the re­cip­ro­cal green lane and pe­ri­odic com­mut­ing ar­range­ment will be pub­lished in the next few days.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the two coun­tries have also agreed to de­velop a pro­posal for daily com­muters cross­ing the bor­der for work. But this will not be in place so soon, Dr Balakr­ish­nan said.</p>
    <p>“Give us a cou­ple of weeks to mon­i­tor the fig­ures both in Malaysia, in par­tic­u­lar Jo­hor, and in Sin­ga­pore, and as we gain greater con­fi­dence that the con­trol of the pan­demic is well ex­e­cuted in both places, we can then be­gin the dis­cus­sions for how we can al­low daily com­mut­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that there may be a need for reg­u­lar com­pre­hen­sive test­ing on both sides even with a daily com­mut­ing model.</p>
    <p>“The other pa­ram­e­ter is also the avail­abil­ity of mass-scale test­ing on both sides of the Cause­way,” he said, adding that there are quite a few more op­er­a­tional de­tails that will need to be sorted out be­fore this model can be adopted.</p>
    <p>The two coun­tries are also work­ing out ar­range­ments for cross-bor­der travel for com­pas­sion­ate rea­sons, he re­vealed.</p>
    <p>“There are Malaysians and Sin­ga­pore­ans re­lated by blood, and in the last few months, I’ve re­ceived so many des­per­ate pleas – my par­ent or my grand­par­ent is in hospi­tal, or is in the in­ten­sive care unit, or some­times worse, has passed away. And they want so des­per­ately to see their own, bid a final farewell.”</p>
    <p>Dr Balakr­ish­nan said he has “great sym­pa­thy” for this cat­e­gory of po­ten­tial trav­ellers, which is smaller, and both coun­tries are try­ing to work out ar­range­ments for them.</p>
    <p>Be­fore Covid-19 re­stric­tions were in place, more than 300,000 peo­ple, many of them Malaysians work­ing in Sin­ga­pore, crossed the land check­points be­tween the two coun­tries daily.</p>
    <p>While some Malaysian work­ers have re­mained in Sin­ga­pore since the move­ment con­trol or­der came into force on March 18 – re­sult­ing in fam­i­lies be­ing sep­a­rated – oth­ers are stuck in Malaysia, which has af­fected Sin­ga­pore busi­nesses that rely on Malaysian man­power.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter was speak­ing to re­porters at the Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Au­thor­ity build­ing in Wood­lands af­ter meet­ing Malaysian For­eign Min­is­ter Hisham­mud­din Hus­sein at the mid­point of the Cause­way to dis­cuss ar­range­ments for cross-bor­der travel be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, both coun­tries an­nounced that cross-bor­der travel for long-term pass hold­ers and trav­ellers on es­sen­tial or of­fi­cial busi­ness would be­gin on Aug 10 under two schemes – the re­cip­ro­cal green lane and pe­ri­odic com­mut­ing ar­range­ment.</p>
    <p>El­i­gi­ble trav­ellers for the green lane – meant for those on es­sen­tial or of­fi­cial busi­ness – will have to abide by mea­sures, in­clud­ing tak­ing Covid-19 swab tests and sub­mit­ting their itin­er­ar­ies.</p>
    <p>The pe­ri­odic com­mut­ing ar­range­ment will al­low Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia res­i­dents who hold longterm im­mi­gra­tion passes for busi­ness and work pur­poses in the other coun­try to en­ter that coun­try for work.</p>
    <p>Dr Balakr­ish­nan said yes­ter­day that trav­ellers under this ar­range­ment will also need to take Covid-19 swab tests. But he added that he is hope­ful there will be more progress on other less in­va­sive, more con­ve­nient and faster means of test­ing that can be adopted in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Af­ter at least three con­sec­u­tive months in their coun­try of work, they may re­turn to their home coun­try for short-term home leave, and then re-en­ter their coun­try of work to con­tinue work­ing for at least another three con­sec­u­tive months.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, long-term pass hold­ers ar­riv­ing in Sin­ga­pore – other than those who have spent the last 14 days in cer­tain coun­tries or re­gions – have to serve a 14-day stay-home no­tice at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>From last Fri­day, ev­ery­one en­ter­ing Malaysia from over­seas, in­clud­ing Malaysians, will have to serve their manda­tory 14-day quar­an­tine at des­ig­nated quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties, and pay for the full cost of their stay.</p>
    <p>Ms Cheong Mun Wai, 37, a Malaysian who lives in Sin­ga­pore with her hus­band and son, was un­able to at­tend her fa­ther’s fu­neral in Se­lan­gor ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>Mak­ing the hard de­ci­sion not to visit her mother be­cause of the manda­tory quar­an­tine and stay­home no­tices in both coun­tries, the chemist said: “The stay-home no­tices in each coun­try make ev­ery­thing tough. Apart from the cost, I don’t have the lux­ury to be away from work or my son for four weeks.”</p>
    <p>Ms Aarathi Aru­mugam, pres­i­dent of the Malaysian As­so­ci­a­tion in Sin­ga­pore, is hop­ing that the re­turn to daily com­mut­ing will be ex­pe­dited.</p>
    <p>“There are cases of Malaysian cou­ples in Sin­ga­pore who have not seen their chil­dren in months and had to en­trust their kids to their neigh­bours, and that is quite sad. There needs to be some so­lu­tion for the Malaysians work­ing here as they are re­ally suf­fer­ing fi­nan­cially as well.”</p>
    <p>ON AL­LOW­ING DAILY COM­MUT­ING</p>
    <p>Give us a cou­ple of weeks to mon­i­tor the fig­ures both in Malaysia, in par­tic­u­lar Jo­hor, and in Sin­ga­pore, and as we gain greater con­fi­dence that the con­trol of the pan­demic is well ex­e­cuted in both places, we can then be­gin the dis­cus­sions for how we can al­low daily com­mut­ing. ’’</p>
