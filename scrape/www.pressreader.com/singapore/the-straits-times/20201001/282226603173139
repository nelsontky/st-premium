    <p>LON­DON • Royal Dutch Shell will cut as many as 9,000 jobs as Covid-19 pre­cip­i­tates a com­pa­ny­wide re­struc­tur­ing into low-car­bon en­ergy.</p>
    <p>Job cuts of 7,000 to 9,000 are ex­pected by the end of 2022, in­clud­ing around 1,500 peo­ple tak­ing vol­un­tary re­dun­dancy this year, Shell said yes­ter­day in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>It sees sus­tain­able an­nual cost sav­ings of US$2 bil­lion (S$2.74 bil­lion) to US$2.5 bil­lion by that time.</p>
    <p>“We have to be a sim­pler, more stream­lined, more com­pet­i­tive or­gan­i­sa­tion,” chief ex­ec­u­tive Ben van Beur­den said.</p>
    <p>“We feel that, in many places, we have too many lay­ers in the com­pany: too many lev­els be­tween me, as the CEO, and the op­er­a­tors and tech­ni­cians at our lo­ca­tions.”</p>
    <p>The move adds to the grow­ing list of ma­jor an­nounce­ments this year which has seen Big Oil slash div­i­dends, take multi­bil­lion-dol­lar write­downs and axe jobs fol­low­ing oil’s coro­n­avirus-in­duced plunge.</p>
    <p>BP said in June it planned to cut 10,000 jobs as it moved into cleaner en­ergy, Chevron plans to trim 10 per cent to 15 per cent of its global work­force, while Exxon Mo­bil is re­view­ing staffing coun­try by coun­try.</p>
    <p>Shell be­gan the process in May, when Mr van Beur­den told staff in a memo that it was re­shap­ing the com­pany to make it leaner and more re­silient and that there could be re­dun­dan­cies in the sec­ond half of the year, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple with knowl­edge of the mat­ter. The An­glo-Dutch ma­jor of­fered vol­un­tary sev­er­ance, scaled back re­cruit­ment and re­viewed ex­pa­tri­ate staff con­tracts.</p>
    <p>The re­or­gan­i­sa­tion is also de­signed to fur­ther Shell’s ex­panded green am­bi­tions. The com­pany said in April it planned to elim­i­nate all net emis­sions from its op­er­a­tions and the bulk of green­house gases from fuel it sells to its cus­tomers by 2050. It also said that ul­ti­mately, it would do busi­ness only with emis­sion-free com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>The com­pany also flagged yes­ter­day that it ex­pects oil-prod­uct sales vol­umes in the third quar­ter to be four mil­lion to five mil­lion bar­rels a day. Re­fin­ing mar­gins will be “sig­nif­i­cantly” lower than in the sec­ond quar­ter. It also sees post­tax im­pair­ment charges of US$1 bil­lion to US$1.5 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted by The Straits Times, a Shell spokesman said: “Through re­shap­ing Shell, we aim to en­able our strat­egy, stream­line our or­gan­i­sa­tion and take out costs. As a re­sult, we will be a sim­pler, more stream­lined, more com­pet­i­tive or­gan­i­sa­tion that is more nim­ble and able to re­spond to cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, no de­tailed guid­ance or fi­nal fig­ures on where the im­pacts will be, as this is still be­ing worked through.”</p>
