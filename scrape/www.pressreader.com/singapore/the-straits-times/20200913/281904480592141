    <p>The coro­n­avirus changed the world but not Wong Lay Hoon’s deter­mi­na­tion to com­pete again in ul­tra­ma­rathons.</p>
    <p>While many live races have been can­celled due to the pan­demic, the bank ex­ec­u­tive, who had surgery on her right an­te­rior cru­ci­ate lig­a­ment in Jan­uary, is back pound­ing the pave­ments. She has also found a new out­let for her pas­sion – virtual runs – and is plan­ning to take part in the Oct 12-Nov 15 Craze Ul­tra, a 100 mile (160km) virtual chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>The 49-year-old said: “Virtual runs give me some­thing to work to­wards, which is bet­ter than not hav­ing any­thing (to train for). With­out a goal or aim in mind, you won’t get that rush.”</p>
    <p>She is not alone, as many fit­ness en­thu­si­asts have turned to the many dig­i­tal al­ter­na­tives avail­able.</p>
    <p>All 4,700 slots for the OCBC Cy­cle 2020 Virtual Ride, a free event, have been snapped up, while the re­main­ing slots for The Straits Times Virtual Run (STVR) are sell­ing out fast. Al­most 70 per cent of OCBC Cy­cle 2020 Virtual Ride’s par­tic­i­pants are sign­ing up for the first time, an in­crease from 40 per cent pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>Virtual races have also been well­re­ceived in­ter­na­tion­ally, with the Virtual London Marathon sell­ing out with over 45,000 en­tries.</p>
    <p>Se­nior lec­turer at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s Nanyang Business School Boey Yew Tung at­trib­uted the pop­u­lar­ity to the promi­nence of th­ese mass sports par­tic­i­pa­tion events. There were 116 mass runs in Sin­ga­pore last year.</p>
    <p>Gyms and ex­er­cise stu­dios ex­pand­ing on­line of­fer­ings re­cently have also helped to nor­malise virtual par­tic­i­pa­tion in work­outs.</p>
    <p>Dr Boey said: “At times... there were more than two such events over a week­end, so peo­ple might be ex­pect­ing this trend to con­tinue.</p>
    <p>“Now that it is pos­si­ble to par­tic­i­pate in virtual races, it is very likely that th­ese fac­tors mo­ti­vated peo­ple to sign up for such races.”</p>
    <p>Some have also joined virtual races for the first time as they find it less daunt­ing com­pared to a tra­di­tional one. The con­ve­nience and flex­i­bil­ity of th­ese virtual races are an­other fac­tor.</p>
    <p>OCBC Cy­cle 2020 Virtual Ride par­tic­i­pant Den­nis Tan, a first­timer, said: “I didn’t want to join pre­vi­ous edi­tions be­cause it’s a huge event with many peo­ple and I was just afraid in terms of pace and num­ber of peo­ple. I pre­fer virtual events, es­pe­cially for first-timers.”</p>
    <p>HOW IT WORKS</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy plays a much big­ger role in virtual races as par­tic­i­pants are re­quired to track their runs, swims and bike rides on a GPS­track­ing device.</p>
    <p>Event man­age­ment com­pany In­fini­tus Pro­duc­tions, or­gan­iser of the Star Wars Virtual Run South­east Asia and STVR, uses its own fit­ness tech­nol­ogy plat­form, MOVE by LIV3LY. There, par­tic­i­pants can log their work­outs and can see how much of each chal­lenge they have com­pleted on the app.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers may rely on ex­ist­ing fit­ness ap­pli­ca­tions such as Strava.</p>
    <p>In­fini­tus Pro­duc­tions man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Jef­frey Foo said: “(One of) the ben­e­fits of tech­nol­ogy is that you can al­most bring (con­sumers) to any venue and it could earn you a slot in the phys­i­cal event that is sold out world­wide.”</p>
    <p>Some or­gan­is­ers like To­goparts. com, which has been or­gan­is­ing virtual cy­cling chal­lenges since 2016, have also come up with plat­forms that al­low in­ter­ac­tions be­tween par­tic­i­pants. Gam­i­fi­ca­tion el­e­ments are added to en­cour­age and re­ward them when they cross cer­tain mile­stones, which is why its CEO Evan Lee be­lieves that virtual races can com­ple­ment phys­i­cal ones.</p>
    <p>Hold­ing the event on­line means that the pro­duc­tion costs can be 40 per cent of those of tra­di­tional races, but the reg­is­tra­tion fee is also sig­nif­i­cantly lower, with sign-up fees of­ten cost­ing less than $20.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers of virtual runs also have to mail race en­ti­tle­ments to par­tic­i­pants, which means that a bulk of the bud­get goes to­wards courier-ser­vice fees in­stead of lo­gis­tics like tent­ages and bar­ri­cades.</p>
    <p>As more tra­di­tional mass sports events have been can­celled or postponed this year, keep­ing races go­ing will “help com­pa­nies re­main top of mind”, said Dr Boey.</p>
    <p>He added: “Re­in­forc­ing brand aware­ness and re­call are im­por­tant tac­tics for com­pa­nies, es­pe­cially when they can­not ac­tively present them­selves to the pub­lic when their reg­u­lar mode of op­er­a­tions is severely cur­tailed.”</p>
    <p>VIRTUAL MEETS HERE TO STAY?</p>
    <p>Most likely, though many say one thing that can­not be repli­cated in virtual races is the race-day at­mos­phere. Dr Leng Ho Keat, an as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor at the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Education’s phys­i­cal education and sports sci­ence de­part­ment, be­lieves live races will still be more pop­u­lar in the near fu­ture.</p>
    <p>He said: “Many... par­tic­i­pate in sports events to en­joy the ca­ma­raderie and cre­ate shared ex­pe­ri­ences with other par­tic­i­pants.”</p>
    <p>Long-dis­tance events such as the Bos­ton Marathon, for which one has to qual­ify, also have a cer­tain pres­tige, which is why James Wal­ton, sports business group leader for Deloitte South-east Asia, be­lieves that the race cal­en­dar will go back to the way it was in two to three years.</p>
    <p>But he added that there could be a mar­ket for virtual events that cover shorter dis­tances or al­low par­tic­i­pants to join a chal­lenge that re­quires them to com­plete a cer­tain dis­tance over a pe­riod of time.</p>
    <p>He said: “For 5km and 10km runs, there’s no crowd, no eu­pho­ria, peo­ple are do­ing it be­cause they want to test them­selves and join their friends in the race. We’ll see th­ese kinds of events more be­cause they fit in the com­mu­nity.”</p>
