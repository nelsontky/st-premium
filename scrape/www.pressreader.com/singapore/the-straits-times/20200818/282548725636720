    <p>FIC­TION THE PHONE BOX AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD</p>
    <p>By Laura</p>
    <p>Imai Messina, trans­lated by Lucy Rand Manilla Press/ Paper­back/</p>
    <p>400 pages/ $26.77/Avail­able at bit.ly/ PhoneBoxWo­rld_LM</p>
    <p>One would ex­pect a story based on the March 11, 2011, triple tragedy of an earth­quake, tsunami and nu­clear accident to dwell, how­ever briefly, on Fukushima – a name with which the dis­as­ter is as­so­ci­ated, given the mag­ni­tude of the nu­clear fall­out.</p>
    <p>But Laura Imai Messina, an Ital­ian au­thor who lives in the coastal city of Ka­makura, south of Tokyo, with her Ja­panese husband and two chil­dren, de­lib­er­ately leaves out any men­tion of Fukushima in her book, even as Ja­pan con­tin­ues to grap­ple with the po­lit­i­cal and en­vi­ron­men­tal con­se­quences of the nu­clear dis­as­ter.</p>
    <p>The ma­jor­ity of the 18,400 peo­ple who died or remain miss­ing are vic­tims of mon­ster waves as high as 14m, trig­gered by a 9.0-mag­ni­tude earth­quake.</p>
    <p>Messina pays trib­ute to these lives, swept away in an in­stant, in the novel, which was orig­i­nally pub­lished in her na­tive Ital­ian and master­fully trans­lated into English by Lucy Rand, who is based in the south-west­ern pre­fec­ture of Oita.</p>
    <p>Grief and loss man­i­fest in dif­fer­ent ways for dif­fer­ent peo­ple, and many have sought re­lief in the Wind Phone, an ac­tual dis­con­nected ro­tary phone in a glass phone box in the town of Ot­suchi, Iwate Pre­fec­ture, over­look­ing the Pa­cific Ocean.</p>
    <p>Messina bases her novel on this phone, which is lo­cated in a non­profit gar­den known as Bell Gar­dia Ku­ji­rayama. Many have made the pil­grim­age to the phone box, which is a ral­ly­ing point for those in mourn­ing, whether or not due to the 2011 tragedy.</p>
    <p>Messina’s fic­tional char­ac­ters, who are re­lat­able in their or­di­nary ways, do like­wise.</p>
    <p>There is Yui, a ra­dio pre­sen­ter, who loses her mother and daugh­ter in the tsunami – and nearly loses her own will to carry on.</p>
    <p>In a poignant chap­ter, Messina writes of Yui rem­i­nisc­ing the birth and death of her daugh­ter: “Af­ter the birth she copied out the baby’s mea­sure­ments pre­cisely: 2,739 grams, 47 cen­time­tres long. (Af­ter her death) she still found her­self count­ing the months un­til the next vac­ci­na­tion on her fin­gers, or writ­ing down some­thing she needed to buy for her.”</p>
    <p>A wi­d­ower calls into her ra­dio pro­gramme one day, talk­ing about the phone box in Iwate that he uses to talk to his late wife.</p>
    <p>Yui de­cides to make the trip her­self. While she can­not bring her­self to speak into the re­ceiver much, she gains a spir­i­tual con­nec­tion with the venue.</p>
    <p>She meets Takeshi, a sur­geon whose three-year-old daugh­ter Hana has stopped speak­ing since the death of his wife. They soon be­come friends.</p>
    <p>Each chap­ter in the book is in­ter­spersed by short in­ter­ludes that can act as frag­mented mem­o­ries, be it a list of favourite con­ver­sa­tion top­ics, a list of snacks bought at a con­ve­nience store or what Yui’s mother and daugh­ter wore when they died.</p>
    <p>Where the book is ex­cep­tional is how it takes the reader on a con­tem­pla­tive jour­ney through the depths of grief and even­tu­ally ac­cep­tance. But it could have been bet­ter paced and have more rounded plot lines for its sup­port­ing char­ac­ters.</p>
    <p>None­the­less, it is a del­i­cate, med­i­ta­tive ode to loss and grief and, in turn, re­silience and hope. Messina writes: “Time may pass, but the mem­ory of the peo­ple we’ve loved doesn’t grow old. It is only we who age.”</p>
    <p>If you like this, read: Pic­nic In The Storm by Yukiko Mo­toya, trans­lated by Asa Yoneda (Cor­sair, 2019, $18.95, avail­able at bit.ly/Pic­nicS­tor­m_YM). Mo­toya finds the whim­si­cal in the ev­ery­day in this se­ries of 10 sur­real short sto­ries and one novella, where strong fe­male lead char­ac­ters grap­ple with strug­gles such as lone­li­ness, re­la­tion­ships los­ing their spark and the loss of one’s sense of iden­tity.</p>
