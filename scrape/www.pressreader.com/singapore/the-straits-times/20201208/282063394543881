    <p>SAV­ING TIME</p>
    <p>Now that there is proper train­ing here, we can save a lot of time and ef­fort... and we can keep up with the new tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>MR BERNARD SIM, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of car ser­vic­ing and re­pair work­shop BVO Au­to­mo­tive.</p>
    <p>Mo­tor work­shop tech­ni­cians will be able to learn about ser­vic­ing elec­tric and hy­brid ve­hi­cles at a new train­ing fa­cil­ity as Sin­ga­pore moves to phase out those with in­ter­nal com­bus­tion en­gines by 2040.</p>
    <p>About 1,000 of the 10,000 tech­ni­cians in Sin­ga­pore are ex­pected to be trained over the next three years at the fa­cil­ity, said the Sin­ga­pore Mo­tor Work­shop As­so­ci­a­tion (SMWA). The SMWA Train­ing Academy opened at Sin Ming Au­toCity in Bis­han yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>SMWA has said there is a need to re­train and up­skill the tech­ni­cians ahead of the ex­pected growth in the use of hy­brid and elec­tric ve­hi­cles, and the fu­ture de­vel­op­ment of au­ton­o­mous ve­hi­cles. The as­so­ci­a­tion’s pres­i­dent, Mr Mike Keh, said the academy “will en­able busi­nesses to level up their pro­duc­tiv­ity and ef­fi­ciency, and to sup­port the trans­for­ma­tion of the au­to­mo­tive work­shop ser­vice in­dus­try”.</p>
    <p>Ex­am­ples of cour­ses avail­able in­clude a foun­da­tion one in elec­tric ve­hi­cle au­totron­ics and a cer­ti­fi­ca­tion pro­gramme in high-volt­age ve­hi­cle re­pairs.</p>
    <p>Var­i­ous gov­ern­ment agen­cies and those in the business have sup­ported the set­ting up of the train­ing fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Bernard Sim, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of car ser­vic­ing and re­pair work­shop BVO Au­to­mo­tive, noted that he had to send his staff over­seas for train­ing as cour­ses on ser­vic­ing elec­tric and hy­brid cars were not read­ily avail­able in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“Now that there is proper train­ing here, we can save a lot of time and ef­fort... and we can keep up with the new tech­nolo­gies,” Mr Sim said.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral other ini­tia­tives were rolled out ear­lier as part of the ef­fort to have all ve­hi­cles run on cleaner en­ergy by 2040.</p>
    <p>This in­cluded the elec­tric ve­hi­cle early adop­tion in­cen­tive and the ex­pan­sion of the na­tional charg­ing net­work for elec­tric ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Trans­port and For­eign Af­fairs Chee Hong Tat, who of­fi­ci­ated at the open­ing of the SMWA fa­cil­ity, said prepa­ra­tions to achieve the cleaner ve­hi­cle goal have to start early be­cause it is a mat­ter of time be­fore such ve­hi­cles be­come wide­spread in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mr Chee, who is also the ad­viser to SMWA, praised the new code of</p>
    <p>BVO Au­toma­tive tech­ni­cian Jay­den Soh work­ing on a bat­tery for hy­brid cars at the com­pany’s work­shop. prac­tice for work­shops which was launched yes­ter­day as well.</p>
    <p>The code pro­vides guide­lines on train­ing work­ers and im­prov­ing the qual­ity of ser­vice. It is the first such na­tional stan­dard for the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Chee: “This... will be very use­ful in up­lift­ing the sec­tor and pro­vid­ing cus­tomers with greater as­sur­ance when they go to work­shops that com­ply with th­ese stan­dards.”</p>
