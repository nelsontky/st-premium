    <p>EX­TRA HELP</p>
    <p>Since it is near­ing the end of the year, and also the hol­i­day pe­riod, we wanted to make sure that the lower-in­come house­holds have some­thing ad­di­tional.</p>
    <p>MS INDRANEE RA­JAH, Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Fi­nance and Na­tional De­vel­op­ment, on the gro­cery vouch­ers for some 150,000 adult Sin­ga­pore­ans liv­ing in one- and two-room Hous­ing Board flats.</p>
    <p>About 150,000 adult Sin­ga­pore­ans liv­ing in one- and two-room Hous­ing Board flats will each re­ceive $150 worth of gro­cery vouch­ers by the end of this month.</p>
    <p>They will also re­ceive another $150 in gro­cery vouch­ers in De­cem­ber, and another set worth $100 in Oc­to­ber next year, said the Min­istry of Fi­nance yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The first round of dis­tri­bu­tion of vouch­ers started on Oct 1, and they will be mailed to the NRIC-reg­is­tered ad­dresses of all re­cip­i­ents.</p>
    <p>The gro­cery voucher scheme is part of the Govern­ment’s Care and Sup­port Pack­age first an­nounced in Fe­bru­ary un­der the Unity Bud­get to cover house­hold ex­penses, with lower-in­come house­holds get­ting ex­tra as­sis­tance. The scheme costs about $46 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Only those aged 21 and above will re­ceive the vouch­ers, which can be used at FairPrice, Giant, Prime and Sheng Siong su­per­mar­ket out­lets for now.</p>
    <p>The $300 worth of gro­cery vouch­ers is­sued this year will ex­pire on Dec 31 next year.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Care and Sup­port Pack­age, all el­i­gi­ble HDB house­holds will also en­joy the ad­di­tional GST Voucher – U-Save, and re­bates for ser­vice and con­ser­vancy charges, among other forms of sup­port.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Fi­nance and Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Indranee Ra­jah, who vis­ited gro­cery voucher re­cip­i­ents at Block 124 Kim Tian Place yes­ter­day, said they were well re­ceived by the res­i­dents as it would help them cope with house­hold ex­penses dur­ing the pan­demic pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“Since it is near­ing the end of the year, and also the hol­i­day pe­riod, we wanted to make sure that the lower-in­come house­holds have some­thing ad­di­tional,” added Ms Indranee, who is the MP for the Tan­jong Pa­gar-Tiong Bahru ward.</p>
    <p>The block at Kim Tian Place com­prises 288 one-room flats, and is one of seven rental blocks in the Tiong Bahru precinct.</p>
    <p>The majority of the res­i­dents are el­derly, and most of the work­ing adults are daily-rated em­ploy­ees, said Mr Ken­neth Seet, Tiong Bahru Com­mu­nity Cen­tre’s chair­man.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing these chal­leng­ing times, job se­cu­rity is (the res­i­dents’) top con­cern, fol­lowed by so­cial sta­bil­ity. The fo­cus is to re­train them to make sure that those who have lost their jobs can find al­ter­na­tive jobs,” he added.</p>
    <p>The com­mu­nity cen­tre will host a ca­reer fair on Nov 17, in col­lab­o­ra­tion with the Na­tional Trades Union Congress’ Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute and Work­force Sin­ga­pore, said Mr Seet.</p>
    <p>Since last year, Block 124 res­i­dent Ve­lam­mal Chi­nan Rama-Samy, 63, has seen her fam­ily’s in­come fluc­tu­ate. She lives with her 43-year-old daugh­ter and 12-year-old grand­son in a one-room flat. Her daugh­ter is the sole bread­win­ner.</p>
    <p>For three months last year, Madam Ve­lam­mal’s daugh­ter was un­em­ployed.</p>
    <p>The younger woman later se­cured a full-time job as a se­cu­rity guard, but her con­tract turned into a part-time one af­ter the pan­demic hit.</p>
    <p>For the fam­ily, the gro­cery vouch­ers come at a good time as Deep­avali is next month, and house­hold ex­penses will be higher.</p>
    <p>“We can buy what we need, like sweets, dec­o­ra­tions and in­gre­di­ents for cook­ing,” said Madam Ve­lam­mal.</p>
