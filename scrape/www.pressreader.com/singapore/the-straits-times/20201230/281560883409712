    <p>All se­condary and ju­nior col­lege (JC) stu­dents will un­der­take home-based learn­ing for at least two days a month start­ing from the third term of next year. This is set to be­come part of the new nor­mal, pan­demic or not. By the fourth term of 2022, this would have been im­ple­mented at ev­ery level of all</p>
    <p>JCs and se­condary schools.</p>
    <p>All se­condary and ju­nior col­lege stu­dents will un­der­take home­based learn­ing (HBL) at least two days a month, start­ing from the third term of next year, with the prac­tice set to be­come part of the new nor­mal, pan­demic or not.</p>
    <p>By the fourth term of 2022, it would have been im­ple­mented at ev­ery level of all JCs and se­condary schools, the Min­istry of Education (MOE) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>To push the ini­tia­tive along, ev­ery se­condary school stu­dent is set to re­ceive a per­sonal learn­ing de­vice (PLD) by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>A more cal­i­brated ap­proach will be taken with pri­mary school pupils, start­ing with a small-scale pilot in­volv­ing five pri­mary schools, to better un­der­stand how the use of learn­ing de­vices might im­pact younger stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Education Lawrence Wong, who made these an­nounce­ments at the an­nual ap­point­ment and ap­pre­ci­a­tion cer­e­mony for prin­ci­pals yes­ter­day, said the move to full HBL dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod had re­in­forced the need to de­velop stu­dents to be adapt­able and nim­ble, and to be more self-di­rected and in­de­pen­dent learn­ers.</p>
    <p>Teach­ers saw the ben­e­fits of HBL in in­still­ing these at­ti­tudes and mind­sets when their stu­dents took the ini­tia­tive to or­gan­ise them­selves into teams and del­e­gated tasks to one another to com­plete group-based as­sign­ments.</p>
    <p>“The ques­tion now is how we can lock in these gains and main­stream these new prac­tices,” said Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>The an­swer, he added, lay in reg­u­larly sched­uled HBL days with time for some cur­ricu­lum learn­ing. But these would be less struc­tured and also let stu­dents learn out­side of the cur­ricu­lum.</p>
    <p>An­tic­i­pat­ing con­cerns over the af­ford­abil­ity of PLDs, which will take the form of a tablet or a lap­top, Mr Wong said stu­dents can use their Edusave ac­counts to pay for them.</p>
    <p>With the one-off $200 Edusave top-up in April, along with the reg­u­lar an­nual Edusave con­tri­bu­tions, most stu­dents will have enough money in their Edusave ac­counts to pay for the PLDs, said MOE.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents from lower-in­come house­holds will also re­ceive more sub­si­dies so that they do not in­cur any out-of-pocket ex­penses when buy­ing their de­vices.</p>
    <p>While the HBL days will be manda­tory and part of the new cur­ricu­lum, Mr Wong said stu­dents who need to re­turn to school dur­ing HBL days for a va­ri­ety of rea­sons will be al­lowed to do so, in con­sul­ta­tion with their schools and teach­ers.</p>
    <p>These in­clude stu­dents who re­quire more su­per­vi­sion, those with spe­cial needs and those who lack a con­ducive home en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong also ad­dressed con­cerns over stu­dents mis­us­ing the de­vices.</p>
    <p>A de­vice man­age­ment soft­ware will be in­stalled on each de­vice, which will allow teach­ers to con­trol how it is be­ing used, as well as track how stu­dents use the de­vice. MOE will also be ramp­ing up cy­ber-well­ness education.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents whom The Straits Times spoke to wel­comed the move, with many cit­ing more rest and fam­ily time as el­e­ments of HBL that helped re­duce their stress.</p>
    <p>Se­condary 1 stu­dent Veron Chia, 13, was ini­tially con­cerned about be­ing able to fo­cus at home.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Be­dok South Se­condary stu­dent said HBL helped her iden­tify her weak­nesses and taught her to ask for help, in­stead of wait­ing for her teach­ers to no­tice she was having prob­lems.</p>
    <p>“While I missed my friends and do­ing things like group projects, HBL made me do things like plan my own sched­ule and man­age my own work,” she added.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong also em­pha­sised the role that prin­ci­pals play in the evo­lu­tion of the education sys­tem.</p>
    <p>He was speak­ing to re­tir­ing, ro­tat­ing and newly ap­pointed prin­ci­pals and se­nior ed­u­ca­tors. He thanked 30 re­tir­ing se­nior ed­u­ca­tors, com­mend­ing their lead­er­ship through sev­eral pub­lic health crises.</p>
    <p>All se­condary schools, ju­nior col­leges and the Mil­len­nia In­sti­tute will im­ple­ment blended learn­ing for some lev­els from Term 3 next year, and at all lev­els by Term 4 of 2022, the Education Min­istry (MOE) an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, ev­ery se­condary school stu­dent is set to re­ceive a per­sonal learn­ing de­vice (PLD) – a lap­top or tablet – by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>MOE and The Straits Times an­swer some burn­ing ques­tions from par­ents and stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Q What is blended learn­ing and how does it dif­fer from home-based learn­ing (HBL)?</p>
    <p>A Blended learn­ing is a mix of home-based and in-school ac­tiv­i­ties that taps both on­line and off­line ap­proaches to learn­ing.</p>
    <p>MOE said yes­ter­day that it is mak­ing blended learn­ing a key fea­ture of the school­ing ex­pe­ri­ence to fur­ther de­velop stu­dents’ “abil­ity to be self-di­rected, pas­sion­ate and life­long learn­ers”.</p>
    <p>Full HBL in­volves stu­dents be­ing off cam­pus for a con­tin­u­ous pe­riod with­out re­turn­ing to school.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, HBL days, as part of blended learn­ing, will be on a reg­u­lar ba­sis through­out the school year – usu­ally for a day each time – in what the min­istry hopes will in­cul­cate the prac­tice of self-di­rected learn­ing.</p>
    <p>It com­ple­ments in-school teach­ing and learn­ing.</p>
    <p>Q When can stu­dents ex­pect to re­ceive their per­sonal learn­ing de­vice, and how much will it cost?</p>
    <p>A MOE said the de­vices will be dis­trib­uted in two phases next year.</p>
    <p>Phase one takes place in Term 2 and cov­ers 86 schools, while phase two sees stu­dents from 66 schools re­ceiv­ing their PLDs by Term 3.</p>
    <p>Q How much will the de­vices cost?</p>
    <p>A MOE has not re­vealed how much each PLD will cost, but said most stu­dents will have suf­fi­cient funds in their Edusave ac­counts to pay for the de­vices, given the one-off top-up of $200 pro­vided in April.</p>
    <p>This top-up was given to all el­i­gi­ble Sin­ga­porean stu­dents in pri­mary and se­condary schools, in­clud­ing those in spe­cial education schools, in ad­di­tion to an­nual de­posits made to Edusave ac­counts.</p>
    <p>“MOE and the schools are com­mit­ted to work­ing with fam­i­lies to en­sure that no se­condary school stu­dent who should have a PLD will be with­out ac­cess to a PLD due to fi­nan­cial rea­sons,” said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>Education Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said the min­istry is also work­ing with the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Author­ity to pro­vide sub­sidised broadband ac­cess for stu­dents from lower-in­come house­holds.</p>
