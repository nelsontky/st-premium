    <p>Life can bring about un­ex­pected turns, but also de­liver fresh op­por­tu­ni­ties. Mr Mark Tan was at his wits’ end af­ter be­ing laid off in 2019. Hav­ing worked for 39 years, the 57-yearold for­mer project man­ager felt a loom­ing sense of un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>The fa­ther of three could not find suit­able job op­por­tu­ni­ties and even con­sid­ered early re­tire­ment. For­tu­nately, things changed when he ap­plied to be a frontline vol­un­teer with the SG Health­care Corps, which led him to a new ca­reer.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan is cur­rently work­ing as a health­care as­sis­tant at St. An­drew’s Nurs­ing Home (Queen­stown), and will be trans­ferred to St. John’s-St. Mar­garet’s Nurs­ing Home (SJSMNH), when the sis­ter in­sti­tu­tion be­gins op­er­a­tions in 2021.</p>
    <p>Fresh be­gin­nings</p>
    <p>Mr Tan was ini­tially un­sure if he could pick up new skills as fast as his younger co-work­ers, but quickly dis­cov­ered that his skills in time man­age­ment, com­mu­ni­ca­tion and eye for de­tail are use­ful in his new role.</p>
    <p>As a health­care as­sis­tant, he works closely with other health­care pro­fes­sion­als such as doc­tors and nurses to care for the nurs­ing home’s res­i­dents. For ex­am­ple, he helps nurses feed and shower res­i­dents, and also keeps fam­ily mem­bers in­formed of their well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>His pres­ence at SJSMNH will be much ap­pre­ci­ated too. Ms Win­nie Chan, the nurs­ing home’s ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor, says they wel­come peo­ple like Mr Tan who do not have health­care ex­pe­ri­ence but are keen to work in the sec­tor:</p>
    <p>“With Mark’s won­der­ful at­ti­tude and lead­er­ship qual­i­ties, we are op­ti­mistic he can go far in this sec­tor. We’re com­mit­ted to train­ing pas­sion­ate in­di­vid­u­als from di­verse back­grounds to join us in our Com­mu­nity Care team.”</p>
    <p>“I am thank­ful for this op­por­tu­nity. It brings me joy to con­trib­ute to­wards pro­vid­ing the best care for our se­niors,” says Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>Re­ward­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties in health­care</p>
    <p>Mr Tan is one of the many Sin­ga­pore­ans who have ben­e­fited from the SGUnited Jobs ini­tia­tive, where up to 7,500 jobs and about 1,600 trainee­ships, work at­tach­ments and skills train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties will be of­fered pro­gres­sively till 2021 in the health­care sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Ms Priscilla Teo, group chief hu­man re­source of­fi­cer at</p>
    <p>Na­tional Uni­ver­sity Health Sys­tem, says: “A wide ar­ray of jobs is avail­able in­clud­ing pa­tient sup­port care, med­i­cal in­for­mat­ics spe­cial­ists, ad­min­is­tra­tive and an­cil­lary roles for fresh grad­u­ates and mid-ca­reer en­trants with or with­out health­care ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>Such op­por­tu­ni­ties are eas­ily ac­ces­si­ble via the Virtual Ca­reer Fair ( VCF), an on­line ca­reer search por­tal launched by Work­force</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim May Ling, di­rec­tor of Strate­gic Hu­man Re­source at SingHealth, adds: “Health­care is a dy­namic and grow­ing in­dus­try which is ever so ex­cit­ing and ful­fill­ing. We of­fer a com­pelling en­vi­ron­ment to re­alise one’s per­sonal and pro­fes­sional as­pi­ra­tions, and op­por­tu­ni­ties to make a dif­fer­ence, im­prove health out­comes and de­fine</p>
    <p>to­mor­row’s medicine. ”</p>
    <p>That said, a will­ing­ness to learn is nec­es­sary. As Ms Rose­mary Soong, di­rec­tor of Group Hu­man Re­source at Na­tional Health­care Group, says: “As health­care ad­vances, it is cru­cial for health­care work­ers to keep abreast of the lat­est de­vel­op­ments. The health­care sec­tor strives to pro­vide learn­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for new en­trants and mid-ca­reer switch­ers.”</p>
    <p>As for Mr Tan, he is grate­ful for a fresh start in health­care — es­pe­cially since the work is so mean­ing­ful and re­ward­ing.</p>
    <p>In­ter­ested in­di­vid­u­als may wish to at­tend the up­com­ing VCF for Com­mu­nity Care jobs, which will be held from 19 Oc­to­ber to 1 Novem­ber.</p>
