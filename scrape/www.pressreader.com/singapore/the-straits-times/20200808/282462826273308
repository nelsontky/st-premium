    <p>• Tiger Woods took a page out of the Cham­pi­ons Tour play­book on Thursday to shoot a solid two-un­der 68 in the opening round of the PGA Cham­pi­onship, the year’s first Ma­jor.</p>
    <p>The for­mer world No. 1, cur­rently ranked 15th, has bat­tled back prob­lems for sev­eral years, lead­ing to spinal fu­sion surgery.</p>
    <p>But, hav­ing switched to a longer put­ter – which is more com­monly seen on the PGA Tour’s se­nior cir­cuit – at TPC Hard­ing Park, he feels it makes him more com­fort­able over the ball.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been mess­ing around with this put­ter for the bet­ter part of over a year. It’s dif­fi­cult for me to bend over at times,” said the 44-year-old.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore, it wasn’t un­usual for me to spend four, five, six hours putting, per day. I cer­tainly can’t log that with my back be­ing fused.</p>
    <p>“Most of the guys on the Cham­pi­ons Tour have gone to longer put­ters as they have got­ten older, be­cause it’s eas­ier to bend over, or not bend over.”</p>
    <p>While the reign­ing Mas­ters cham­pion is cer­tainly not ready for the Tour’s 50-and-over cir­cuit, the 15-time Ma­jor cham­pion, in­clud­ing four pre­vi­ous PGA Cham­pi­onship wins, is not get­ting any younger, which means he has to be willing to adapt his game.</p>
    <p>The first in­di­ca­tion that his put­ter was go­ing to spark was a 32-foot birdie putt on his fourth hole, the 13th, that got him to two un­der.</p>
    <p>Woods teed off with four-time Ma­jor win­ner Rory McIl­roy and newly crowned world No. 1 Justin Thomas, although the lat­ter two strug­gled, shoot­ing 70 and 71 re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>For­mer world No. 1 Ja­son Day and the 48th-ranked Bren­don Todd shared the one-stroke lead af­ter a bo­gey-free 65, while de­fend­ing cham­pion Brooks Koepka got his hat-trick bid off to a solid start, end­ing one shot off the pace.</p>
    <p>The PGA Cham­pi­onship is be­ing played without spec­ta­tors, as will the re­main­der of the Tour sea­son, due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, so there was a strange si­lence on the opening tee box when the an­nouncer called out Woods’ name and listed his ac­com­plish­ments.</p>
    <p>“It’s just the way it is. This is our norm for a while,” he said. “I don’t know how long it’s go­ing to be. The en­ergy is dif­fer­ent. You’re not go­ing to have as many dis­trac­tions out there, as well.”</p>
    <p>If Woods is to win his 16th Ma­jor and move just two be­hind record­holder Jack Nick­laus, he knows the key to scor­ing well at Hard­ing Park is to avoid the rough, which is taller and thicker than nor­mal.</p>
    <p>“This golf course, you have to hit the ball in the fair­way. You get a ball in the rough, into the grain, there’s no chance you can get the ball to the green,” he said.</p>
