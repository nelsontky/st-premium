    <p>LON­DON • The mass par­tic­i­pa­tion Lon­don Marathon has been cancelled ow­ing to the Covid-19 pandemic, but an elite-only race fea­tur­ing a show­down “duel” be­tween dis­tance stars Eliud Kip­choge and Ke­nenisa Bekele may still be staged on Oct 4, the Bri­tish me­dia said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The an­nual race, which nor­mally at­tracts al­most 40,000 run­ners and raises mil­lions of pounds for char­ity, was orig­i­nally pushed back from April.</p>
    <p>But the on­go­ing com­pli­ca­tions caused by the coro­n­avirus cri­sis, not least the po­ten­tial in­fec­tion risk caused by hun­dreds of thou­sands of fans lin­ing the route through cen­tral Lon­don, meant that host­ing it was im­prac­ti­ca­ble.</p>
    <p>Four of the six World Marathon Ma­jors – Bos­ton, Ber­lin, New York and Chicago – have al­ready been cancelled and though Lon­don al­ways looked likely to join them, race direc­tor Hugh Brasher tried to leave the de­ci­sion as late as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Tokyo was con­verted into an elite run­ners-only event at the out­set of the coro­n­avirus pandemic in early March.</p>
    <p>While huge crowds nor­mally as­so­ci­ated with Lon­don will not hap­pen this year, Kip­choge, who holds the world record in the marathon at 2hr 1min 39sec, and Bekele, who owns the world record in both the 5,000m and 10,000m, have re­port­edly been in­vited to take part in a multi-lap course in and around a cen­tral Lon­don park.</p>
    <p>The cir­cuit will be a short loop, with con­trolled ac­cess to limit fan num­bers, but the pres­ence of the only two men who have ever gone un­der two hours, two min­utes for the 42.195km marathon should still be a draw should or­gan­is­ers be able to pull it off.</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old de­fend­ing cham­pion Kip­choge, who be­came the first man to run a sub two-hour marathon in an unof­fi­cial race in Vi­enna last Oc­to­ber, is seek­ing a record fifth Lon­don ti­tle.</p>
    <p>The Kenyan has won 11 of the 12 marathons he has started, in­clud­ing at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.</p>
    <p>Ethiopian Bekele, who is three years older, has won three Olympic and five world cham­pi­onship golds over 5,000m and 10,000m, as well as 11 cross-coun­try world cham­pi­onship golds.</p>
    <p>He clocked 2:01:41 in Ber­lin last Oc­to­ber to miss Kip­choge’s mark by two sec­onds. The of­fi­cial can­cel­la­tion an­nounce­ment was not avail­able at press time.</p>
