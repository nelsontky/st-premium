    <p>• AMC En­ter­tain­ment Hold­ings’ ex­ec­u­tives are fo­cused on rais­ing enough cap­i­tal to keep the strug­gling the­atre chain afloat un­til sum­mer, when they be­lieve a Covid-19 vac­cine and a back­log of block­buster films will re­verse its for­tunes.</p>
    <p>The world’s largest cin­ema chain said on Nov 2 it has enough cash to last un­til early 2021, as­sum­ing at­ten­dance re­mains at its cur­rent, mod­est level.</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Adam Aron said he was talk­ing to more than a dozen strate­gic in­vestors about po­ten­tial eq­uity i nvest­ments, as well as cur­rent l en­ders to shore up its liq­uid­ity un­til sum­mer.</p>
    <p>“It all re­ally comes down to one thing: We be­lieve that we will need to raise more cap­i­tal,” Mr Aron said on a call with an­a­lysts after re­port­ing a third-quar­ter loss of US$905.8 mil­lion (S$1.2 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>AMC is still in the midst of per­haps the most gru­elling year i n its cen­tury-long his­tory. The com­pany closed its en­tire do­mes­tic the­atre cir­cuit in March as the pan­demic spread across the United States and has re­opened un­der dif­fi­cult cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>There are few new films to draw in au­di­ences to the au­di­to­ri­ums and the the­atres that are open must cap ticket sales to ad­here to so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules.</p>
    <p>The Lea­wood, Kansas-based com­pany said its rev­enue tum­bled to US$119.5 mil­lion in the third quar­ter, plung­ing from al­most US$1.32 bil­lion a year ago.</p>
    <p>AMC still faces more ob­sta­cles. Based on cur­rent at­ten­dance and agree­ments with land­lords, it projects its cash burn will in­crease go­ing into the fourth quar­ter, ris­ing to more than US$100 mil­lion a month. Ad­di­tion­ally, some of the 261 of its 358 in­ter­na­tional lo­ca­tions that had pre­vi­ously re­opened will have to close again, as the virus spread wors­ens in Europe.</p>
    <p>AMC, which is con­trolled by bil­lion­aire Wang Jian­lin’s Dalian Wanda Group, may not need quite as much cash if stu­dios start re­leas­ing new films.</p>
    <p>The next big po­ten­tial block­buster is not sched­uled un­til Christ­mas Day, when Warner Bros’ Won­der Woman 1984 is set to hit cine­mas. Mr Aron said he be­lieved the stu­dio was try­ing its hard­est to stick to that date.</p>
    <p>Al­to­gether he cal­cu­lated that 44 movies sched­uled to come out in 2020 were de­ferred un­til 2021 or later, sug­gest­ing a wind­fall for the­atres that can sur­vive the pan­demic.</p>
