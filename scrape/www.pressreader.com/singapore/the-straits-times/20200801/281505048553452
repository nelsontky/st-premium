    <p>The Sen­tosa Golf Club (SGC) has be­come the world’s first golf club to join the United Na­tions’ Sports for Cli­mate Ac­tion Ini­tia­tive, af­ter sign­ing up fol­low­ing its col­lab­o­ra­tion with in­ter­na­tional golf sus­tain­abil­ity non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion GEO Foun­da­tion yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The UN’s Sports for Cli­mate Ac­tion Ini­tia­tive aims to sup­port and guide sports or­gan­i­sa­tions and their com­mu­ni­ties on a path to achiev­ing the global cli­mate change goals set out by world lead­ers in the Paris Agree­ment. Other ma­jor sport­ing or­gan­i­sa­tions which have joined the ini­tia­tive in­clude La Liga, New York Yan­kees, and the All Eng­land Lawn Ten­nis Club.</p>
    <p>SGC will join these other par­tic­i­pants in com­mit­ting to a set of five agreed prin­ci­ples and in­cor­po­rat­ing them into their club strat­egy, poli­cies and pro­ce­dures.</p>
    <p>They are to pro­mote greater en­vi­ron­men­tal re­spon­si­bil­ity; re­duce the over­all cli­mate im­pact from sports; use the plat­form to ed­u­cate for cli­mate ac­tion; pro­mote sus­tain­able and re­spon­si­ble con­sump­tion; and ad­vo­cate for cli­mate ac­tion through com­mu­ni­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive will also pro­vide sports or­gan­i­sa­tions with a fo­rum where they will have the op­por­tu­nity to pur­sue cli­mate ac­tion by learn­ing from one an­other, de­vel­op­ing new tools, and col­lab­o­rat­ing on ar­eas of mu­tual in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>SGC gen­eral man­ager and di­rec­tor of agron­omy An­drew John­ston said: “We have al­ready taken great strides with our sus­tain­abil­ity pro­gramme in the last two years and are there­fore ex­tremely ex­cited to be join­ing this ini­tia­tive. We be­lieve it is the right step for us as a club to con­tinue on our jour­ney to tackle cli­mate change through­out the world and the game of golf.”</p>
    <p>Since launch­ing its #Keep­ItGreen cam­paign at the SMBC Sin­ga­pore Open in Jan­uary 2018, SGC has im­ple­mented nu­mer­ous en­vi­ron­men­tal fea­tures such as the cre­ation of its own bee colonies, us­ing recharge­able lithium bat­ter­ies in golf carts, and ban­ning sin­gle-use plas­tics from both its golf courses. Cur­rently the World’s Best Golf Club (World Golf Awards), it has also in­stalled elec­tric ve­hi­cle charg­ing sock­ets and built a sus­tain­able herb gar­den.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal en­vi­ron­men­tal group LepakInSG be­lieves that hav­ing a Sin­ga­pore venue in a UN ini­tia­tive shows that or­gan­i­sa­tions here are “able to have an out­sized im­pact on global cli­mate ac­tion” de­spite the Repub­lic con­tribut­ing to just 0.11 per cent of global emis­sions.</p>
    <p>Co-founder of LepakInSG Ho Xiang Tian said: “One way (for SGC) to have a greater im­pact would be to share what they’ve done with other golf courses, and get them to adopt those prac­tices.”</p>
    <p>At this Jan­uary’s SMBC Sin­ga­pore Open, the club un­veiled a new global sus­tain­abil­ity cam­paign Game On to unite the global golf com­mu­nity in ad­dress­ing the grow­ing con­cerns of cli­mate change. It aims to help golf clubs around the world bet­ter pre­pare for cli­mate change by in­tro­duc­ing modern sus­tain­abil­ity prac­tices to re­duce their own en­vi­ron­men­tal foot­print.</p>
    <p>GEO Foun­da­tion founder and ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Jonathan Smith said: “This an­nounce­ment un­der­lines the strength of Sen­tosa’s for­ward-look­ing com­mit­ment to sus­tain­abil­ity and cli­mate ac­tion.</p>
    <p>“We con­grat­u­late them on tak­ing this im­por­tant and am­bi­tious lead­er­ship step, and look for­ward to sup­port­ing that com­mit­ment.”</p>
