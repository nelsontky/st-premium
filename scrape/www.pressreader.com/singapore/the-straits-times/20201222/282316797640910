    <p>PACK­AGES FROM CHINA’S SIN­GLES’ DAY SALES, CRE­AT­ING AN EN­VI­RON­MEN­TAL NIGHT­MARE |</p>
    <p>SHANG­HAI • If you worry about all the waste gen­er­ated by the an­nual rush of hol­i­day shop­ping and gift giv­ing, it is noth­ing com­pared with the moun­tains of dis­carded pack­ag­ing that comes from a sin­gle event in China.</p>
    <p>On Nov 11 each year, the world’s big­gest con­sumer mar­ket goes into over­drive as e-com­merce gi­ants like Alibaba Group Hold­ing and JD.com lure shop­pers with huge bar­gains dur­ing the Sin­gles’ Day sale.</p>
    <p>Alibaba re­ported al­most 500 bil­lion yuan (S$102 bil­lion) in sales this year, nearly four times the United States’ Black Fri­day and Cy­ber Mon­day spend­ing com­bined.</p>
    <p>On its Tmall plat­form, trans­ac­tions reached a peak when 583,000 or­ders were made in a sin­gle sec­ond.</p>
    <p>All those pur­chases meant 675 mil­lion pack­ages had to be de­liv­ered, a 26 per cent in­crease from last year.</p>
    <p>On­line shop­ping in China gen­er­ated 9.4 mil­lion tonnes of pack­ag­ing in 2018, ac­cord­ing to Green­peace, which projects that the amount could rise to 41 mil­lion tonnes by 2025, about the same as all the waste pro­duced by Ja­pan in a year.</p>
    <p>Green­peace es­ti­mates that Sin­gles’ Day gen­er­ated 52,400 tonnes of car­bon diox­ide from man­u­fac­tur­ing, pack­ag­ing and ship­ping in 2017.</p>
    <p>The na­tional rail­way has to em­ploy hun­dreds of high-speed trains to help with de­liv­er­ies ev­ery year.</p>
    <p>As Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping pushes for stronger en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion and con­sumers grow more eco-con­scious, China’s e-com­merce gi­ants are un­der pres­sure to find greener ways to han­dle the an­nual event, start­ing with plas­tic.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s soar­ing use of the ma­te­rial has be­come one of the world’s most press­ing en­vi­ron­men­tal is­sues, but switch­ing to other ma­te­ri­als is costly for smaller busi­nesses and the gov­ern­ment has strug­gled to im­ple­ment a plan to phase out sin­gle-use plas­tics.</p>
    <p>E-com­merce com­pa­nies are try­ing to stem the tide.</p>
    <p>For Sin­gles’ Day this year, Alibaba’s lo­gis­tics arm Cainiao de­signed re­cy­clable cor­ru­gated card­board boxes that do not have to be sealed with plas­tic tape.</p>
    <p>The com­pany of­fered the pack­ag­ing to more than 500 sell­ers on Tmall, in­clud­ing brands like Nes­tle and Proc­ter & Gam­ble.</p>
    <p>The so-called zip­per boxes cost twice as much as their usual pack­ag­ing, but sell­ers that opt to use them get ex­tra pro­mo­tion on the web­site.</p>
    <p>Cainiao says it used 190,000 plas­tic-free boxes and three mil­lion biodegrad­able bags to pack­age Sin­gles’ Day or­ders this year.</p>
    <p>While that is a step for­ward, it is just a frac­tion of the to­tal in­crease in pack­ag­ing this year.</p>
    <p>At one of Cainiao’s ware­houses in Lang­fang city, south-east of Bei­jing, the zip­per boxes ap­peared fre­quently on the assem­bly line as em­ploy­ees worked in shifts around the clock to meet de­mand dur­ing the busiest week last month.</p>
    <p>Cainiao em­bla­zons the boxes with dol­phin im­ages to “raise aware­ness of how plas­tic pol­lutes the oceans”, said Mr Tang Lin­rong, a mem­ber of the com­pany’s pack­ag­ing so­lu­tions team.</p>
    <p>He said his team plans to pro­mote the zip­per boxes at other shop­ping events through­out the year.</p>
    <p>The na­tion is mak­ing other ef­forts to cut ship­ping waste.</p>
    <p>China’s State Post Bureau says 96 per cent of the coun­try’s de­liv­ery ser­vices have adopted dig­i­tal way­bills and switched to thin­ner pack­ag­ing tape to re­duce plas­tic use.</p>
    <p>Sun­ing.com, an ap­pli­ance seller, last year launched shared de­liv­ery box pro­grammes in 13 cities.</p>
    <p>But it is the mil­lions of smaller re­tail­ers, the back­bone of China’s con­sumer goods in­dus­try, that are the stick­ing point.</p>
    <p>Un­like Tmall, which mostly caters to es­tab­lished brands and in­ter­na­tional com­pa­nies, Alibaba’s Taobao plat­form al­lows th­ese ven­dors to sell di­rectly to cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Prices are so com­pet­i­tive that re­duc­ing pack­ag­ing and ship­ping costs are cru­cial for sell­ers to make a profit.</p>
    <p>Cainiao’s head of in­ter­na­tional com­mu­ni­ca­tions An­gela Cai said Taobao will give re­tail­ers that join its green ini­tia­tives spe­cial perks to help them at­tract cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Still, with­out gov­ern­ment reg­u­la­tion, com­pa­nies are left to de­cide if they want to use more sus­tain­able pack­ag­ing.</p>
    <p>On­line shop­ping has be­come such a key driver of China’s do­mes­tic econ­omy, es­pe­cially dur­ing the pan­demic, that the au­thor­i­ties have been re­luc­tant to in­sti­tute rules that could hurt the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The en­vi­ron­ment min­istry, which drives cli­mate poli­cies, does not have the power to man­date greener pack­ag­ing.</p>
    <p>“There is a mis­match be­tween which depart­ment has the power to man­age, what can they man­age and what needs to be man­aged,” said Green­peace East Asia plas­tics cam­paigner Tang Damin.</p>
    <p>“The reg­u­la­tor in charge of pack­ag­ing in the de­liv­ery sec­tor can do noth­ing more than give sug­ges­tions to the e-com­merce busi­ness.”</p>
    <p>China of­fi­cially banned free plas­tic bags at mar­kets in 2008 and has said that non-degrad­able plas­tic straws should be elim­i­nated by this year, but those dec­la­ra­tions have largely been ig­nored by the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>An am­bi­tious manda­tory re­cy­cling pilot pro­gramme that was rolled out in cities – in­clud­ing Shang­hai and Bei­jing – has strug­gled to take off.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment put out slo­gans on garbage sort­ing every­where, but I see more and more un­sorted trash,” said a worker sur­named Zhao.</p>
