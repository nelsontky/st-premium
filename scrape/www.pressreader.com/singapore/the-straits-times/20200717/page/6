        TOPOF THE NEWS A6 THE STRAITS TIMES FRIDAY, JULY 17, 2020 | | | 7 indicators of how well a country has done in Covid-19 fight The ability to detect and break transmissi­on chains The ability of healthcare system to minimise deaths and severe complicati­ons The ability to protect and support vulnerable and neglected groups • How quickly a country is able to pick up new cases, and scale up testing and contact tracing capabiliti­es in the face of increased demand.
One set of data to look at would be the percentage of cases which were found through contact tracing. • Government­s can assess this by collating the number of deaths per million population as well as the ventilator capacity per million population.
These must be measured consistent­ly over time as they indicate the resilience of the hospital system, including emergency department­s, general wards and intensive care units, and their capabiliti­es to respond to increased patient demand. • These include low-income earners and the elderly, who might not be in the know about the latest Covid-19 developmen­ts and the precaution­s they should take.
One way to assess the impact on these groups would be based on the number and size of recent clusters among them. • • • How well healthcare workers are protected • Essential health services should never be reduced throughout the pandemic while non-essential services should be restored promptly.
Some disturbanc­es to routine health services are inevitable as some among the healthcare workforce will be assigned to outbreak management, and some people may be deterred from using routine health services during the outbreak.
Such challenges can be mitigated through the use of telemedici­ne and the ring-fencing of selected hospitals for non-Covid-19 procedures. • This would look at the availabili­ty of personal protective equipment as well as the number of healthcare-associated infections. • • The amount of financial support for individual­s and companies, especially for those who need treatment • Scale and size of the programmes rolled out for those in isolation or quarantine as well as for groups adversely impacted by social restrictio­ns.
