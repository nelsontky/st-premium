    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s de­ci­sive vic­tory in last Satur­day’s Sabah elec­tion has come at the cost of mount­ing un­hap­pi­ness from his largest ally Umno over not be­ing given the chief min­is­ter­ship.</p>
    <p>With the Muhyid­din ad­min­is­tra­tion – largely made up of MPs from the Premier’s Perikatan Na­sional (PN) coali­tion, the Umno-led Barisan Na­sional (BN) and Sarawak’s rul­ing Gabun­gan Parti Sarawak – num­ber­ing just 113 MPs for a wafer-thin ma­jor­ity in the 222-strong Par­lia­ment, po­lit­i­cal in­sid­ers and an­a­lysts be­lieve the mo­men­tum to­wards snap polls has ac­cel­er­ated in the past week.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri An­war Ibrahim’s claim on Sept 23 that he has se­cured enough de­fec­tions for a “for­mi­da­ble ma­jor­ity” is yet to be re­solved as Malaysia’s King is still hos­pi­talised, pre­vent­ing an au­di­ence, and with</p>
    <p>Umno pres­i­dent Zahid Hamidi say­ing BN would not stop its “many MPs” who are back­ing the leader of Pakatan Hara­pan (PH), the main op­po­si­tion pact.</p>
    <p>“Muhyid­din emerges from the Sabah elec­tions stronger, but un­til An­war’s claim to have a ma­jor­ity has been dis­proven, there re­mains con­sid­er­able po­lit­i­cal un­cer­tainty. Sub­ject to Covid-19 de­vel­op­ments, the Prime Min­is­ter will be in­creas­ingly tempted to call early elec­tions to cap­i­talise on the mo­men­tum,” risk con­sul­tancy Eura­sia Group’s Asia di­rec­tor, Mr Peter Mum­ford, told The Straits Times, re­fer­ring to how a resur­gent num­ber of cases in Malaysia may give pause to thoughts of hold­ing fed­eral polls.</p>
    <p>The once-dom­i­nant Umno – which ruled Malaysia from in­de­pen­dence un­til its shock 2018 de­feat – and Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia (PAS) have pushed for fresh polls prac­ti­cally from the mo­ment PH col­lapsed in Fe­bru­ary, de­spite even­tu­ally back­ing Tan Sri Muhyid­din as prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>The next gen­eral elec­tion is due only in 2023.</p>
    <p>The Parti Pribumi Ber­satu</p>
    <p>Malaysia pres­i­dent has him­self said dur­ing the Sabah cam­paign that win­ning the state would mean hold­ing a gen­eral elec­tion soon.</p>
    <p>A na­tional bal­lot had been ex­pected by early next year, but ob­servers be­lieve cur­rent de­vel­op­ments could see Par­lia­ment dis­solved without pass­ing Bud­get 2021, sched­uled to be pre­sented on Nov 6.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din’s al­liance in Sabah beat Parti Warisan Sabah pres­i­dent Shafie Ap­dal’s pact with 38 seats against Warisan’s 32, with three in­de­pen­dents even­tu­ally back­ing PN for a com­fort­able ma­jor­ity in form­ing the new state govern­ment.</p>
    <p>Ber­satu of­fi­cials told The Straits Times that the Premier’s pop­u­lar­ity was clearly seen in the run-up to the polls. Re­cent opin­ion polls have re­peat­edly en­dorsed Mr Muhyid­din’s higher ap­proval com­pared with other lead­ers and var­i­ous par­ties in his govern­ment.</p>
    <p>But a tus­sle for the chief min­is­ter­ship be­gan min­utes af­ter vic­tory was se­cured last Satur­day night and was only re­solved on Tues­day, with Ber­satu se­cur­ing the po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Umno won 14 seats, while PN took 17 with Parti Ber­satu Sabah (PBS) aligned to Mr Muhyid­din, se­cur­ing seven wards. How­ever, Ber­satu it­self only won 11 seats.</p>
    <p>Umno was fur­ther en­raged by al­leged sab­o­tage, sources from the party told ST. They claim PN, PBS and even in­de­pen­dent can­di­dates were backed by Ber­satu to con­test against BN, deny­ing the Umno-led pact of wins in up to 10 con­stituen­cies.</p>
    <p>“We were forced to face in­de­pen­dents that were spon­sored by in­ter­ested par­ties to weaken Umno,” deputy pres­i­dent Mo­hamad Hasan said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This has led to grow­ing pres­sure within Umno for Datuk Seri Zahid to take a firmer stance against Ber­satu, to whom it has ceded not just the lead­er­ship of Sabah, but also the Perak and the fed­eral govern­ments de­spite be­ing the larger party in those leg­is­la­tures.</p>
    <p>“It would be a pop­u­lar de­ci­sion with the grass­roots to play hard­ball,” an Umno leader told ST. “We can even block the bud­get.”</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Mo­hamad also called on Mr Zahid “to of­fer guid­ance and clear di­rec­tion”.</p>
    <p>“The next episode is how Umno will of­fer lead­er­ship and cre­ate a bet­ter fu­ture for Malaysia via BN and not other po­lit­i­cal plat­forms,” he said. “If we have to be with PAS and BN on our own in fac­ing the com­ing elec­tions, then de­cide soon so we can pre­pare our­selves.”</p>
