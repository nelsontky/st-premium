    <p>The num­ber of visas Hong Kong’s im­mi­gra­tion depart­ment is­sued to pro­fes­sional jobs in the first half of this year has dropped by more than 60 per cent to 7,717, from 19,756 in the same pe­riod a year ago.</p>
    <p>But it is not just Covid-19 that is caus­ing ex­pa­tri­ates to leave Hong Kong. Anti-govern­ment protests that started last June di­min­ished the ap­peal of the fi­nan­cial hub.</p>
    <p>For­eign­ers are in­creas­ingly wary of the new, wide-rang­ing na­tional se­cu­rity law that China im­posed on the city in June, which granted Bei­jing ex­ten­sive pow­ers to search with­out war­rants, and pe­nalise and freeze the as­sets of any­one deemed a se­cu­rity threat.</p>
    <p>As well, the do­mes­tic po­lit­i­cal un­cer­tainty is ex­ac­er­bated by de­te­ri­o­rat­ing Sino-Amer­i­can ties.</p>
    <p>A co-founder of an en­ter­tain­ment-re­lated busi­ness in Hong Kong, who spoke on con­di­tion of anonymity, says she has moved her busi­ness to Sin­ga­pore due to wor­ries about the na­tional se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>“They’ve not put a hard and fast rule to (it) and it could be any­thing un­der the sun. Maybe it’s un­founded, but there is that con­cern. It’s a bet­ter-safe-than-sorry sit­u­a­tion,” says the en­tre­pre­neur, who is in her 50s.</p>
    <p>“The other rea­son we moved is that I feel there are more op­por­tu­ni­ties in Sin­ga­pore at the mo­ment than Hong Kong for what we do.”</p>
    <p>Her de­ci­sion to leave the city af­ter liv­ing there for over two decades was also trig­gered by con­cerns that the US dol­lar could turn into a po­ten­tial land­mine if ties be­tween the United States and China hit rock bot­tom, as her com­pany trades in the green­back.</p>
    <p>Re­lo­ca­tion spe­cial­ists and re­cruiters have also said that ex­pa­tri­ates were al­ready leav­ing Hong Kong even be­fore the peak of the pan­demic ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Asian Tigers Mo­bil­ity, one of Hong Kong’s big­gest re­lo­ca­tion ser­vice providers, said the num­ber of ex­pa­tri­ates ask­ing for quotes to re­lo­cate went up by 30 to 40 per cent at the end of last year, the Fi­nan­cial Times re­ported.</p>
    <p>That was be­fore the coro­n­avirus out­break. Of the 7.5 mil­lion pop­u­la­tion in Hong Kong, more than 700,000 are for­eign res­i­dents, a cat­e­gory that in­cludes do­mes­tic helpers as well as white-col­lar ex­pats and their de­pen­dants.</p>
