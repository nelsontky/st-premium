    <p>SEOUL • South Korean Prime Min­is­ter Chung Sye-kyun said it is in­evitable that so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures will be tight­ened to the strictest level un­less the coun­try’s out­break can be con­tained.</p>
    <p>South Korea con­firmed 1,030 cases yes­ter­day, break­ing the pre­vi­ous day’s record of 950 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>If the spread con­tin­ues, the govern­ment will have no choice but raise mea­sures to level three, Mr Chung said in a meet­ing on Satur­day, urg­ing that ef­forts be made to curb the spread to re­duce the im­pact that tighter lim­its would have on the econ­omy and so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>The Korea Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion Agency said 1,002 of the cases an­nounced yes­ter­day were lo­cal in­fec­tions, with more than 70 per cent from the greater Seoul area.</p>
    <p>That is de­spite re­stric­tions be­ing at the sec­ond-high­est level of 2.5 out of a scale of three in the re­gion since last Tues­day.</p>
    <p>On his Face­book ac­count, Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in on Satur­day re­ferred to the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion as an emer­gency and or­dered the mo­bil­i­sa­tion of all re­sources to con­tain the virus. South Korea had been praised and em­u­lated for its ear­lier suc­cess in slow­ing the virus’ spread with­out a lock­down, re­ly­ing in­stead on rapid test­ing and con­tact trac­ing to re­duce flare-ups.</p>
    <p>Un­der level three re­stric­tions, gath­er­ings of 10 peo­ple or more are pro­hib­ited, in­clud­ing all sport­ing events, while schools can of­fer only on­line classes. The pub­lic is ad­vised to stay at home as much as pos­si­ble, and com­pa­nies are re­quired to have non-es­sen­tial em­ploy­ees work from home.</p>
    <p>There are no travel re­stric­tions, although for­eign vis­i­tors are re­quired to be quar­an­tined for 14 days un­less they are ex­empt un­der cross-bor­der agree­ments. South</p>
    <p>Korea last month mod­i­fied its so­cial dis­tanc­ing sys­tem with a fivetier sys­tem that in­ten­si­fies re­stric­tions ac­cord­ing to the sever­ity of the out­break.</p>
    <p>Level three is adopted when an ex­treme spike in lo­cally trans­mit­ted in­fec­tions sparks a large-scale, na­tion­wide out­break, or when daily cases reach 800 or more, ac­cord­ing to the Korea Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion Agency.</p>
