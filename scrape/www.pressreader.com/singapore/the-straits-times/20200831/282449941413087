    <p>AGE: 29 HEIGHT: 1.7m WEIGHT: 60kg</p>
    <p>Ms Toh’s love for ex­er­cise and sports started when she was just six years old.</p>
    <p>She en­joyed sim­ple ex­er­cises such as rope skip­ping and even joined her pri­mary school’s skip­ping group as a co-cur­ric­u­lar ac­tiv­ity (CCA).</p>
    <p>It led her to par­tic­i­pate in na­tional and in­ter­na­tional skip­ping com­pe­ti­tions in coun­tries such as Thai­land and Malaysia.</p>
    <p>She took up net­ball as a CCA in se­condary school and cul­ti­vated her skills fur­ther by join­ing a pri­vate net­ball club, called Llabten, out­side of school.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, she took her fit­ness regime up a notch by work­ing out at a pub­lic gym two or three times a week.</p>
    <p>Ms Toh, who has a de­gree in bank­ing and fi­nance from the Univer­sity of Lon­don at the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Man­age­ment, said: “I have al­ways wanted to main­tain my fit­ness level since I was young, to build more mus­cle and strength and also for aes­thetic rea­sons.”</p>
    <p>When she was in Ngee Ann Polytech­nic, she took up muay thai at a fight­ing gym out­side school.</p>
    <p>She de­scribed the sport as a “phys­i­cal and men­tal chal­lenge”, some­thing that she en­joyed.</p>
    <p>Four years ago, she left her job as a cor­po­rate banker to be­come a full-time per­sonal fit­ness trainer at ATP Per­sonal Train­ing gym in Ce­cil Street. She cur­rently has 16 clients.</p>
    <p>“Fit­ness has al­ways been some­thing I was pas­sion­ate about. I wanted to help peo­ple be­come stronger, achieve their fit­ness goals and live health­ier,” said Ms Toh, whose 30-year-old boyfriend is also a per­sonal trainer.</p>
    <p>Last year, she checked off an item on her “to-do” list by join­ing two body­build­ing com­pe­ti­tions: HomeTeamNS Fit­ness Iron­man and Fit­ness Move­ment Sin­ga­pore Na­tion­als.</p>
    <p>“I like how body­builders look on stage and I wanted to ex­pe­ri­ence that for my­self,” she said.</p>
    <p>She had to do spe­cific work­outs such as steady state car­dio and high-in­ten­sity in­ter­val train­ing, fo­cus­ing on her legs, butt, shoul­ders and back.</p>
    <p>Ms Toh won first place in her height cat­e­gory – 1.7m and above – for both com­pe­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>The wins have spurred her to par­tic­i­pate in more body­build­ing com­pe­ti­tions in fu­ture.</p>
