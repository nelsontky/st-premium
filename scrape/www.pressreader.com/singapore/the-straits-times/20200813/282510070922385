    <p>BEIRUT • The mon­ster ex­plo­sion that lev­elled Beirut’s port last week dark­ened the Le­banese cap­i­tal’s fu­ture, but also blasted its past into obliv­ion, rav­aging many beloved ar­chi­tec­tural and cul­tural trea­sures.</p>
    <p>Gems of the city’s her­itage, in­clud­ing some of the re­gion’s most el­e­gant Le­van­tine vil­las with their triple-arch win­dows, were dam­aged be­yond re­pair.</p>
    <p>Many of old Beirut’s re­main­ing colo­nial-era and ear­lier land­marks had al­ready been dam­aged by 15 years of civil war and decades of govern­ment ne­glect. Last Tues­day’s blast fin­ished the job.</p>
    <p>Days af­ter the dis­as­ter, Ms Ta­nia Ingea gave a tour of her home on Sur­sock Street, which bears her rel­a­tives’ name and houses some of the most strik­ing ves­tiges of the old Beirut aris­toc­racy’s hey­day.</p>
    <p>“It feels like a rape,” says the heiress of the man­sion, pre­vi­ously known as Palais de la Res­i­dence.</p>
    <p>The dev­as­tat­ing blast of a pile of in­dus­trial fer­tiliser, widely blamed on govern­ment neg­li­gence, was so pow­er­ful that it lit­er­ally re­drew Beirut’s coast­line and sky­line.</p>
    <p>Ms Ingea’s con­verted 18th­cen­tury palace now looks like it has been van­dalised, with bro­ken Ot­toman-era arte­facts in ev­ery one of both floors’ rooms.</p>
    <p>Wooden pan­els in­scribed with Ara­bic cal­lig­ra­phy have been blown off doors and walls and now sit piled in cor­ners of the house.</p>
    <p>Shards of stained glass more than two cen­turies old have been swept aside to one cor­ner with the rest of the waste.</p>
    <p>When Le­banon marks its cen­ten­nial in three weeks, the port blast will have de­prived it of some of the most grace­ful relics of that pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“There is now a cut be­tween the present and the past,” Ms Ingea says. “It is an in­ter­rup­tion in the trans­mis­sion of mem­ory of a place, of a fam­ily, of a por­tion of the his­tory of the city.”</p>
    <p>Just next door is the Sur­sock Mu­seum, a cul­tural bea­con in a coun­try whose trea­sures are of­ten poorly pro­tected and show­cased.</p>
    <p>The man­sion-turned-mu­seum, which only a few months ago was hous­ing a land­mark Pi­casso ex­hi­bi­tion, now tells the story of a city’s des­e­cra­tion.</p>
    <p>Its fa­cade is crum­bling above a grand im­pe­rial stair­case that curves up­wards in an arch.</p>
    <p>The Mediter­ranean light that pre­vi­ously trick­led through the build­ing’s stained-glass win­dows now floods the struc­ture, ren­dered al­most en­tirely open-air.</p>
    <p>Mr Jac­ques Aboukhaled, the ar­chi­tect who led ren­o­va­tion ef­forts there for around 20 years, says the “fab­ric” of the build­ing is safe, but pres­sure from the blast blew off al­most ev­ery­thing else.</p>
    <p>“As it is a closed build­ing, there was an im­plo­sion from ev­ery sin­gle cor­ner,” says the 68-year-old. “I did not ex­pect to see so much dam­age.”</p>
    <p>He es­ti­mated that the re­pairs would take more than a year and cost mil­lions of dol­lars. But he is not de­terred. “I feel very at­tached to this build­ing. It’s like our house.”</p>
    <p>Built as a man­sion in 1912, the palace opened its doors as a mu­seum nearly 50 years later, as in­structed in the will of its owner, Mr Ni­co­las Sur­sock, who wanted his grand home con­verted af­ter his death.</p>
    <p>It re­opened in 2015 af­ter an eightyear clo­sure for ma­jor ren­o­va­tion work, its new walls adorned with paint­ings from the coun­try’s “golden era” in the 1960s.</p>
    <p>Be­tween 20 and 30 art­works were dam­aged in the blast, mainly by fly­ing shards of glass, ac­cord­ing to a mu­seum spokesman.</p>
    <p>They in­clude the art col­lec­tion’s main gem: a circa-1930 por­trait of Mr Sur­sock, painted by renowned Dutch-French artist Kees van Don­gen.</p>
    <p>The blast caused the paint­ing to fall, cut­ting a slash into the can­vas that stops right at Mr Sur­sock’s fore­head.</p>
    <p>“It’s my favourite paint­ing,” said Ms Elsa Hokayem, the mu­seum’s as­sis­tant di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>In­spect­ing the Na­tional Mu­seum of Beirut af­ter last Tues­day’s ex­plo­sion, Cul­ture Min­is­ter Ab­bas Mor­tada said he was re­lieved Le­banon’s main ar­chae­o­log­i­cal trove es­caped dis­as­ter, with only its ex­ter­nal fa­cade slightly dam­aged.</p>
    <p>He could not say the same for “hun­dreds” of other her­itage build­ings al­ready pock­marked and made frail by Le­banon’s dev­as­tat­ing civil war be­tween 1975 and 1990.</p>
    <p>“Most of the her­itage build­ings are dam­aged,” he said. “It’s go­ing to take a lot of work.”</p>
    <p>He es­ti­mated that re­pairs would cost “hun­dreds of mil­lions of dol­lars”, but said they needed to be car­ried out ur­gently, be­fore heavy win­ter rains sweep away what is left.</p>
    <p>A cul­ture min­istry team is con­duct­ing a dam­age as­sess­ment, but Mr Mor­tada was bank­ing on out­side help, espe­cially from France.</p>
    <p>“We need ren­o­va­tion works to hap­pen as soon as pos­si­ble,” he said, warn­ing of the com­ing rains. “If win­ter comes and they are not done... this will pose a grave dan­ger.”</p>
