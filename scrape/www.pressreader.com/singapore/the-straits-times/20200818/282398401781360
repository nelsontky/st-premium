    <p>Va­len­cia pres­i­dent Anil Murthy has told the Span­ish La Liga club’s sup­port­ers that it needs to be “re­spon­si­ble” as it braces for the “se­ri­ous” im­pact of Covid-19 on foot­ball.</p>
    <p>In an open let­ter to them on the club’s web­site pub­lished on Satur­day, the 47-year-old Sin­ga­porean, a former diplo­mat, sought to ex­plain the re­al­i­ties fac­ing the club on two fronts: the sum­mer mar­ket in sign­ing play­ers and plans to build a new sta­dium.</p>
    <p>He also launched a staunch de­fence of the club’s fi­nan­cial stew­ard­ship un­der Peter Lim, fol­low­ing protests from a sec­tion of vo­cal Los Che fans who have ac­cused the Sin­ga­porean bil­lion­aire of “neg­li­gently man­ag­ing the club” and “de­te­ri­o­rat­ing the value of the team”.</p>
    <p>NEED FOR FI­NAN­CIAL PRU­DENCE</p>
    <p>Murthy high­lighted that the club is in bet­ter fi­nan­cial shape now than in the re­cent past – it racked up debts of up to €547 mil­lion (S$888 mil­lion) in June 2009 – and has been able to finance the debts from 2017, when pre­vi­ously it had not done so since 2009.</p>
    <p>He noted that when Lim be­came the ma­jor­ity share­holder in 2014, “there was a to­tal of €48 mil­lion in player salaries un­paid, and no cash in the bank”.</p>
    <p>In 2019-20, Va­len­cia had “by far their great­est ever in­come in his­tory”. The sea­son prior, they won their first ti­tle in 11 years. But even with their Span­ish King’s Cup suc­cess, con­tin­u­ing to spend im­pru­dently on play­ers, he added, was “not sus­tain­able”. “We stopped it and cut losses be­fore we go too far into trou­ble,” ex­plained Murthy.</p>
    <p>Va­len­cia com­peted in the Cham­pi­ons League in the last two sea­sons and reached the Europa League semi-fi­nals last year. But they fin­ished ninth in the re­cent La Liga sea­son, and fail­ure to qual­ify for Euro­pean foot­ball is a fi­nan­cial set­back, as clubs can earn €15.25 mil­lion and €3 mil­lion re­spec­tively in group-stage base fees in the Cham­pi­ons League and Europa League, with add-ons for wins, draws and progress to the lat­ter stages.</p>
    <p>There will also be a fi­nan­cial hit from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, Murthy added, with the club’s to­tal in­come likely to be halved over the next two sea­sons, com­mer­cial in­come from at­ten­dances and spon­sor­ship also drop­ping by 50 per cent while tele­vi­sion rights money could fall by about 30 per cent.</p>
    <p>“So we have to re­build,” he said. “This is nei­ther the be­gin­ning nor the end. We must learn from the past. Push­ing the ‘big sta­dium, big play­ers, win La Liga and Cham­pi­ons League at all cost’ will lead to a re­peat of the past.”</p>
    <p>In his first pub­lic com­ments on the mat­ter, owner Lim also re­minded the fans: “A bank­rupt club is not a bet­ter club.”</p>
    <p>TRANS­FER MAR­KET</p>
    <p>In a bid to re­duce its wage bill, Va­len­cia sold winger Fer­ran Tor­res to Manch­ester City for €23 mil­lion while mid­field­ers Fran­cis Co­quelin and Dani Parejo joined Vil­lar­real for a re­ported com­bined €11 mil­lion to Vil­lar­real.</p>
    <p>It was yet an­other source of un­hap­pi­ness for fans but Murthy said Tor­res, 20, a prod­uct of the club’s youth academy and a player the fans loathed to see leave, “chose to leave in spite of be­ing of­fered one of the best salaries in the team”.</p>
    <p>“Each one chooses their path,” he added.</p>
    <p>“We learn from this ex­pe­ri­ence but we don’t for­get. We have a good group of play­ers from our academy com­ing up and we will make sure we don’t have this kind of prob­lem again.”</p>
    <p>STA­DIUM PLANS STALLED</p>
    <p>Murthy also ad­dressed on­go­ing ef­forts to sell and re­de­velop the club’s Mestalla sta­dium, af­ter a deal with ADU Mediter­ra­neo fell through as the real es­tate devel­op­ers could not se­cure fi­nan­cial guar­an­tees for the re­ported €113 mil­lion trans­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>He laid bare the club’s “sus­tain­able model” to finance the project, say­ing that the “sim­ple plan” in­volved:</p>
    <p>• Sell­ing the fa­cil­ity for a min­i­mum</p>
    <p>of €120 mil­lion</p>
    <p>• Build­ing it for €150 mil­lion with fi­nanc­ing for the re­main­ing</p>
    <p>€30 mil­lion</p>
    <p>• In­creas­ing the ca­pac­ity to a pos­si­ble 65,000, up from the cur­rent 48,600</p>
    <p>• In­creas­ing sea­son ticket prices and gen­eral pub­lic tick­ets by an av­er­age of 15 per cent to sup­port the op­er­at­ing costs of a big­ger sta­dium.</p>
    <p>“Now with the cur­rent eco­nomic cli­mate dur­ing Covid, in­vestors are wait­ing,” said Murthy. “But many are ask­ing. We will con­tinue to work with the Gen­er­al­i­tat and the Ayun­tamiento (govern­ment bod­ies) on this im­por­tant project for the city (and) find a so­lu­tion to the new sta­dium.”</p>
    <p>He stressed that the club is tak­ing a care­ful ap­proach to the mat­ter, say­ing: “This is a project that has led to the bank­ruptcy of the club be­fore.</p>
    <p>“We are not go­ing to sell all of our play­ers to build a new sta­dium!”</p>
    <p>Urg­ing pa­tience, he added: “We are com­mit­ted to build a sus­tain­able club and to keep it grow­ing. It takes time.”</p>
    <p>TAL­ENT DRAIN</p>
    <p>Each one chooses their path. We learn from this ex­pe­ri­ence but we don’t for­get. We have a good group of play­ers from our academy com­ing up and we will make sure we don’t have this kind of prob­lem again. ’’</p>
