    <p>We re­fer to the let­ter by Miss Chris Lim Hong Buay re­gard­ing the em­ploy­ment dis­missal of her sis­ter, Ms Lim (The lit­tle guy who failed to find re­course over ter­mi­na­tion, Sept 24).</p>
    <p>As with all cases, the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) ex­am­ines all rel­e­vant facts pre­sented by both the em­ployee and em­ployer.</p>
    <p>Due process is given to both par­ties to re­view each other’s rep­re­sen­ta­tions and re­but or clar­ify if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim had filed an ap­peal against wrong­ful dis­missal on the grounds of age un­der the</p>
    <p>Re­tire­ment and Re-em­ploy­ment Act.</p>
    <p>MOM fa­cil­i­tated the me­di­a­tion process, and also con­ducted a for­mal in­quiry into her dis­missal. The min­istry has es­tab­lished that the dis­missal was not due to the ap­pel­lant’s age.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim’s for­mer em­ployer, a tour op­er­a­tor, had been suf­fer­ing fi­nan­cial losses, and had de­cided to re­struc­ture and cut costs. As a re­sult, the com­pany had to make three job po­si­tions re­dun­dant, in­clud­ing that of Ms Lim.</p>
    <p>The com­pany tried to re­tain Ms Lim by ask­ing her to con­sider an alternativ­e part-time po­si­tion, but she de­clined.</p>
    <p>In dis­miss­ing Ms Lim, the com­pany paid her con­trac­tual dues, in­clud­ing no­tice pay and for out­stand­ing un­used an­nual leave. They also of­fered her an ad­di­tional one month’s ex-gra­tia pay­ment. Dur­ing me­di­a­tion, the com­pany fur­ther of­fered pay­ment to re­solve the dis­pute but Ms Lim de­clined it.</p>
    <p>MOM’s in­ves­ti­ga­tion also es­tab­lished that the com­pany did not re­cruit two new and younger em­ploy­ees with the in­ten­tion to take over Ms Lim’s job, as claimed.</p>
    <p>One em­ployee was re­cruited for a dif­fer­ent port­fo­lio well be­fore the re­dun­dancy of Ms Lim’s po­si­tion. The other was re­cruited to assist Ms Lim, but left the com­pany prior to Ms Lim’s dis­missal.</p>
    <p>We recog­nise the im­pact of the dis­missal on Ms Lim’s liveli­hood and em­pathise with the dif­fi­cul­ties she is go­ing through. Work­force Sin­ga­pore has also been sup­port­ing Ms Lim with ca­reer match­ing ser­vices.</p>
