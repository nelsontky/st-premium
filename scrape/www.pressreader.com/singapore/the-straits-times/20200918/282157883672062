    <p>•</p>
    <p>TAIPEI As gov­ern­ments around the world strug­gle to shel­ter their economies from the ef­fects of the coron­avirus pan­demic, Tai­wan is see­ing the op­po­site.</p>
    <p>Its econ­omy is pro­jected to grow 1 per cent this year, ac­cord­ing to a Bloomberg sur­vey of econ­o­mist es­ti­mates, sec­ond only to China’s 2 per cent among ma­jor economies.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan has ben­e­fited from com­pa­nies shift­ing some of their man­u­fac­tur­ing back home from China amid grow­ing ten­sions be­tween Bei­jing and Wash­ing­ton, as well as in­creased de­mand for its prod­ucts from the United States.</p>
    <p>While such good news would nor­mally in­crease the al­lure of the lo­cal cur­rency – and thereby re­duce the at­trac­tive­ness of Tai­wan’s ex­ports overseas – the is­land’s cen­tral bank has taken ag­gres­sive ac­tion to limit gains.</p>
    <p>The re­sult is that the Tai­wan cur­rency has been the least volatile among 31 ma­jor ex­change rates against the green­back in the past three months, af­ter the pegged Hong Kong dol­lar.</p>
    <p>Al­though Tai­wan has reg­u­larly taken steps to curb strength in its cur­rency be­fore, which the cen­tral bank governor refers to as “smooth­ing”, such in­ter­ven­tion can draw the at­ten­tion of the US Trea­sury.</p>
    <p>At its most ex­treme, be­ing la­belled a ma­nip­u­la­tor can presage sanc­tions. The re­cent ten­sions be­tween Wash­ing­ton and Bei­jing may also be ben­e­fit­ing Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>“With Tai­wan, the safe bet is al­ways that in­ter­ven­tion – or smooth­ing – will con­tinue,” said Mr Brad Setser, an econ­o­mist with the Coun­cil on For­eign Re­la­tions (CFR).</p>
    <p>“The only fac­tor that in my view might in­duce Tai­wan to change is ex­ter­nal pres­sure, and the US Trea­sury has been quiet on this topic since Jan­uary.”</p>
    <p>The cen­tral bank did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to calls for com­ment.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, the US Trea­sury noted in a re­port to Congress that Tai­wan was “close to trig­ger­ing key thresh­olds” that would see it be­ing la­belled a cur­rency ma­nip­u­la­tor.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan is “the only ma­jor econ­omy in Asia that does not pub­lish data on the full de­tails of its in­ter­na­tional re­serves con­sis­tent with In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund (IMF) stan­dards”.</p>
    <p>It is of­ten the case with US Trea­sury re­ports and the two Acts that guide cur­rency-ma­nip­u­la­tor des­ig­na­tion – one passed in 1988, the other in 2015 – that pol­i­tics trumps facts, said Mr Stephen Chiu, a strate­gist for Bloomberg In­tel­li­gence.</p>
    <p>He noted the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s use of the 2015 Act last year to de­clare China guilty was “pretty dis­cre­tionary”, while adding that Tai­wan may be in vi­o­la­tion of the three</p>
    <p>cri­te­ria of the 1988 Act.</p>
    <p>The US Trea­sury is ex­pected to re­lease its next re­port next month.</p>
    <p>There are signs the cen­tral bank may be loos­en­ing its grip on the cur­rency. Af­ter the Tai­wan dol­lar failed to move more than 0.1 per cent on a daily clos­ing ba­sis for al­most six weeks, it climbed 0.4 per cent on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The cur­rency ended 0.25 per cent higher at its strong­est clos­ing level since April 2018 on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>TRADE SUR­PLUS</p>
    <p>The moves are mod­est con­sid­er­ing pres­sure on the cur­rency to gain has only been in­creas­ing.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan is en­joy­ing an ex­port boom, beat­ing even the most op­ti­mistic fore­casts last month.</p>
    <p>It shipped a record US$31.2 bil­lion (S$42.4 bil­lion) in goods, a jump of 8.3 per cent year on year.</p>
    <p>In the first seven months of this year, Tai­wan be­came the US’ ninth­largest trad­ing part­ner, ex­port­ing US$33 bil­lion in goods to its guar­an­tor of se­cu­rity in the face of China’s threat, while run­ning a 15.6 per cent trade sur­plus.</p>
    <p>It is un­clear just how Tai­wan’s cen­tral bank smooths its cur­rency, but it is gen­er­ally sus­pected that it con­stantly buys green­back in or­der to prevent strength­en­ing.</p>
    <p>As Mr Setser ar­gued last Oc­to­ber in a blog post for CFR, the bank could be hid­ing the amount of the US dol­lars it buys by lend­ing to in­sur­ers via swap trad­ing, thus keep­ing the cur­rency off its bal­ance sheet.</p>
    <p>The cen­tral bank can also send verbal mes­sages.</p>
    <p>Last week, it asked banks to limit the amount of US dol­lars that could be sold in a sin­gle trade.</p>
    <p>TRAIL­ING PEERS</p>
    <p>The re­sult has been a re­mark­ably flat Tai­wan cur­rency.</p>
    <p>In the past three months, it has gained 1.2 per cent against the green­back, trail­ing 24 ma­jor cur­ren­cies in­clud­ing the yuan, won and yen, in the same pe­riod when the Bloomberg Dol­lar Spot In­dex has slumped more than 4 per cent.</p>
    <p>A sched­uled in­ter­est-rate de­ci­sion by Tai­wan’s cen­tral bank yes­ter­day is un­likely to change the pic­ture for the cur­rency, with an­a­lysts polled by Bloomberg unan­i­mous that the bench­mark rate will be kept un­changed – at 1.125 per cent.</p>
    <p>It is not just ex­porters the gov­ern­ment needs to con­sider.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan’s in­sur­ers, which sit on NT$30.2 tril­lion (S$1.4 tril­lion) in as­sets, have size­able in­vest­ments overseas, es­pe­cially in US cor­po­rate bonds.</p>
    <p>A rapidly strength­en­ing cur­rency would re­sult in a val­u­a­tion loss as well as force them to hedge their ex­po­sure abroad, ac­cord­ing to Mr Setser.</p>
    <p>Pres­sure on the cen­tral bank to re­strain the cur­rency is likely to grow next quar­ter be­cause of iPhone or­ders and a pos­si­ble shift in or­ders to Tai­wan from China amid the US’ ban on Huawei Tech­nolo­gies sales, ac­cord­ing to Mr Chiu.</p>
    <p>At the same time, Wash­ing­ton is un­likely to des­ig­nate Taipei a cur­rency ma­nip­u­la­tor.</p>
    <p>“As long as Tai­wan is a po­lit­i­cal ally of the US against China, it won’t be named,” he added.</p>
