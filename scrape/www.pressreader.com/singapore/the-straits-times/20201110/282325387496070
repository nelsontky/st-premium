    <p>TOKYO • Ja­pan’s SoftBank Group yes­ter­day re­ported a 1.4 tril­lion yen (S$18.1 bil­lion) net gain on in­vest­ments in its two Vi­sion funds, as a broad up­swing in tech val­u­a­tions brought the value of its mam­moth first fund back above wa­ter.</p>
    <p>The re­cov­ery in the first Vi­sion Fund is likely to be seen as wel­come news for in­vestors un­nerved by some of SoftBank’s re­cent stum­bles, even as the re­sults were tainted by a US$1.3 bil­lion hit af­ter a de­riv­a­tive loss re­lated to in­vest­ment in listed stocks.</p>
    <p>Founder Masayoshi Son had long had a rep­u­ta­tion for in­vest­ing pre­science – he was an early backer of Chi­nese e-com­merce giant Alibaba Group Hold­ing – but that was tar­nished af­ter the spec­tac­u­lar flame­out of port­fo­lio firm We­Work and mis­steps fol­low­ing the pan­demic. “I’m not that hung up on the num­bers,” Mr Son said of the group’s earn­ings, re­it­er­at­ing SoftBank’s view that net as­set value is the pri­mary mea­sure by which the firm should be judged.</p>
    <p>SoftBank said it had net gain on in­vest­ment from the two funds of 1.4 tril­lion yen in the six months un­til Septem­ber, though much of that re­flected un­re­alised profit from port­fo­lio com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>The first fund is now worth some US$76.4 bil­lion (S$102.6 bil­lion), slightly north of the US$75 bil­lion paid for its 83 in­vest­ments, it said.</p>
    <p>The smaller sec­ond fund saw a big up­lift af­ter hous­ing firm Ke Hold­ings’ list­ing. The fund had a fair value of US$7.6 bil­lion ver­sus a to­tal cost of US$2.6 bil­lion, SoftBank said.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese con­glom­er­ate has been sell­ing down core as­sets such as stakes in Alibaba and do­mes­tic telco SoftBank Corp to raise cash to weather the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Son in Au­gust said SoftBank would park ex­cess cash from as­set mon­eti­sa­tion in tech­nol­ogy stocks and de­riv­a­tives in at at­tempt to cap­i­talise on an up­lift in val­u­a­tions in the sec­tor. The bets, which come as SoftBank hopes to re-es­tab­lish its in­vest­ing chops af­ter its strug­gles, were un­done by a 292 bil­lion yen de­riv­a­tive loss.</p>
    <p>Still, at the end of Septem­ber, SoftBank held po­si­tions worth US$16.8 bil­lion in stocks in­clud­ing Ama­zon.com, Google par­ent Al­pha­bet and Face­book.</p>
    <p>The firm said net in­come at­trib­ut­able to share­hold­ers was 1.88 tril­lion yen for the six months un­til Septem­ber, an over four­fold in­crease from the same pe­riod a year ear­lier. That pri­mar­ily re­flected a gain re­lated to the merger of port­fo­lio firm Sprint with T-Mo­bile US, it said.</p>
    <p>The group has dropped op­er­at­ing profit as a per­for­mance met­ric, cit­ing a shift away from run­ning busi­nesses to tech in­vest­ing.</p>
    <p>SoftBank has also used some of its cash to buy back shares, push­ing its stock price to record highs.</p>
    <p>But the per­sis­tent gap be­tween SoftBank’s mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion and the value of its as­sets has left frus­trated ex­ec­u­tives mulling over plans to take the group pri­vate, Reuters re­ported in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, SoftBank plans to list a blank-cheque firm to draw out­side in­vest­ment to its Vi­sion Fund, in a sign of re­turn­ing con­fi­dence af­ter a string of soured in­vest­ments, a source said last month.</p>
