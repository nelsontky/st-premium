    <p>Mr Shinzo Abe’s sud­den an­nounce­ment that he will leave of­fice a year early, made days af­ter he achieved the record of be­com­ing Ja­pan’s longest­serv­ing prime min­is­ter in the post-World War II era, has been re­ceived with shock and for many, dis­may. Mr Abe said the re­cur­rence of ul­cer­a­tive col­i­tis, a disease he has suf­fered since child­hood, made it dif­fi­cult for him to give his of­fice the full at­ten­tion it de­serves. In 2007, the same condition caused him to cut short his first stint in of­fice af­ter barely a year. But ad­vances in medicine had of­fered treat­ments that held the disease in check. Amid the ten­sions of bat­tling the worst pan­demic out­break in liv­ing mem­ory and height­ened geopo­lit­i­cal ten­sions, his ail­ment seems to have re­turned.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe will be missed, and not just at home where he presided over a Ja­panese resur­gence that would have been high­lighted by the host­ing of the Olympic Games this year, a swan­song that was not to be be­cause of the Covid-19 out­break. On his watch, Ja­panese diplo­macy played off the front foot in Asia – whether in bol­ster­ing the Ja­pan-United States al­liance, en­list­ing wider sup­port for the Indo-Pa­cific con­cept which he fash­ioned both as a strate­gic and eco­nomic plan, or in mid­wif­ing a cred­i­ble trade pact from the rem­nants of the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship that was re­jected by US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump. He also made it a point to visit Asean cap­i­tals, partly to sig­nal the re­gion’s cen­tral­ity in Asian af­fairs.</p>
    <p>What’s next for Ja­pan? Much de­pends on who suc­ceeds him. Al­ready, Mr Shigeru Ishiba, a for­mer de­fence min­is­ter and Mr Abe’s long­stand­ing party ri­val, has sig­nalled in­ter­est. How­ever, given Mr Abe’s dom­i­nance over his govern­ment and the rul­ing Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party, he will likely have a say in the mat­ter. Hav­ing worked tire­lessly to make Ja­pan a more “nor­mal” coun­try in so many ways, in­clud­ing the trans­for­ma­tional rein­ter­pre­ta­tion of the Con­sti­tu­tion that al­lows the Ja­panese mil­i­tary to come to the aid of al­lies, Mr Abe will likely en­sure a mea­sure of pol­icy con­ti­nu­ity. That could fur­ther the lead­er­ship chances of Mr Abe’s right-hand man, Chief Cabi­net Sec­re­tary Yoshi­hide Suga, who seems to want the job.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers in the run­ning in­clude De­fence Min­is­ter Taro Kono and En­vi­ron­ment Min­is­ter Shin­jiro Koizumi. Mr Kono has floated the idea of Ja­pan join­ing the Five Eyes in­tel­li­gence part­ner­ship that groups the US, Bri­tain, Canada, Aus­tralia and New Zealand. Like­wise, Tokyo’s de­ci­sion to buy into the F-35 fighter air­craft pro­gramme, the re­fit­ting of its two he­li­copter car­ri­ers to be able to host the mar­itime ver­sion of the planes, and the es­tab­lish­ment in 2013 of a Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil are de­ci­sions that point in a cer­tain direc­tion and not eas­ily re­versed. Net­tle­some as abrupt changes of lead­er­ship tend to be, any change in tack is likely to be more of nu­ance than sub­stance.</p>
