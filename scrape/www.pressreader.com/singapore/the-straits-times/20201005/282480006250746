    <p>A SPE­CIAL DAY FOR A SPE­CIAL LADY: Amer­i­can singer Gwen Ste­fani turned 51 last Satur­day, and her boyfriend, coun­try singer Blake Shel­ton, lost no time in ex­press­ing his love for her.</p>
    <p>Shel­ton, 44, took to so­cial me­dia that day and wrote: “It’s a spe­cial day for a spe­cial lady in my life. Happy birth­day @gwen­ste­fani, I’d write a song for you ev­ery sin­gle day if I could.” His post also showed a photo (left) of them from their mu­sic video Happy Any­where, where she is seen cosy­ing up to him in a corn field.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Ste­fani, lead vo­cal­ist of the band No Doubt, posted a black-and-white baby photo of her­self on In­sta­gram, thank­ing ev­ery­one for their birth­day wishes.</p>
    <p>Shel­ton and Ste­fani met as coaches on singing-com­pe­ti­tion show The Voice and went pub­lic with their re­la­tion­ship in Novem­ber 2015 af­ter ru­mours of them dat­ing sur­faced on­line.</p>
    <p>Shel­ton was mar­ried to fel­low coun­try singer Mi­randa Lam­bert, 36, from 2011 to 2015, while Ste­fani was mar­ried to English singer</p>
    <p>Gavin Ross­dale, 54, for nearly 14 years un­til 2016.</p>
    <p>Ste­fani and Shel­ton bought their first home to­gether in Cal­i­for­nia ear­lier this year, al­though she dis­closed she had been spend­ing time at his ranch in Oklahoma with her three sons with Ross­dale dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The couple are prepar­ing for the 19th sea­son of The Voice with their fel­low coaches, singers John Legend and Kelly Clark­son.</p>
