    <p>The new StarHub TV+ Box is the pay TV op­er­a­tor’s se­cond An­droid me­dia stream­ing player after 2018’s StarHub Go Stream­ing Box.</p>
    <p>It comes pre­loaded with the newly up­graded StarHub TV+ app, which is com­pat­i­ble with iOS and An­droid de­vices. The box runs on An­droid TV (based on ver­sion 10), a vari­ant of the pop­u­lar mo­bile oper­at­ing sys­tem made for tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>Be­cause the apps have to be op­ti­mised for the big screen, the Google Play Store for the An­droid TV plat­form has only a frac­tion of the apps for the mo­bile ver­sion.</p>
    <p>But essen­tial stream­ing apps such as Net­flix and HBO Go are avail­able and pre­loaded on the TV+ Box I tested. I was glad to see Net­flix – a glar­ing omis­sion from StarHub’s pre­vi­ous stream­ing box. The Net­flix app on the TV+ Box sup­ports up to 4K res­o­lu­tion with high dy­namic range, which is avail­able with the stream­ing ser­vice’s pre­mium plan ($19.90).</p>
    <p>But Net­flix is not the rea­son to get the TV+ Box. After all, the app is al­ready found in most smart TVs.</p>
    <p>The TV+ Box comes with a cus­tom launcher that dis­plays StarHub’s pay TV of­fer­ings promi­nently on the home screen. They are bun­dled into six cat­e­gories (or passes), such as Western TV shows and Asian fare. The passes can be pur­chased via the “Store” tab at the top of the screen.</p>
    <p>Un­like a stan­dard An­droid TV box, you can­not cus­tomise the in­ter­face, like adding YouTube to the home screen, which is an­noy­ing.</p>
    <p>The de­vice is slightly big­ger than my palm. A USB port sup­ple­ments the lim­ited in­ter­nal stor­age (there was only 4.7GB free in my re­view set).</p>
    <p>I like the re­mote con­trol, which feels more solid than the one for the pre­vi­ous me­dia stream­ing box. It also comes with short­cut but­tons for Net­flix and StarHub’s store, and a mi­cro­phone for Google As­sis­tant.</p>
    <p>If you plan to play An­droid games, you will prob­a­bly need a gamepad.</p>
    <p>While the TV+ Box’s gam­ing per­for­mance out­shines its pre­de­ces­sor’s, it still has laggy mo­ments. Try less graphic-in­ten­sive games for a start.</p>
    <p>In terms of per­for­mance and cus­tomi­sa­tion, the me­dia stream­ing box – de­spite the im­prove­ments – is still not as good as a top An­droid me­dia player like the Nvidia Shield TV.</p>
    <p>But it is a con­ve­nient all-in-one de­vice for fam­i­lies with mem­bers who still watch StarHub’s pay TV con­tent as well as those who have cut the cord.</p>
