    <p>Ja­panese elec­tric su­per­car maker As­park is now tak­ing or­ders for its Owl (right), touted as the fastes­tac­cel­er­at­ing car ever pro­duced.</p>
    <p>Priced at over US$3.5 mil­lion (S$4.6 mil­lion) or close to $12 mil­lion if reg­is­tered in Sin­ga­pore, the Owl hits 100kmh in un­der two sec­onds.</p>
    <p>With close to 2,000hp, Ja­pan’s first bat­tery-pow­ered su­per­car will do bat­tle with cars such as the Lo­tus Evija, Pin­in­fa­rina Bat­tista and Ri­mac C Two.</p>
    <p>Pro­duc­tion has be­gun, with a lim­ited se­ries of 50 cars avail­able world­wide. The com­pany said it is working on a sec­ond car.</p>
    <p>Fer­rari agent Ital Auto will launch the SF90 Spi­der (right) and Portofino M in the sec­ond quar­ter of the year.</p>
    <p>The SF90 Spi­der is ex­pected to be priced at $1,977,544 and the Portofino M at $862,952 – both be­fore the cer­tifi­cate of en­ti­tle­ment (COE).</p>
    <p>The Roma, which was pre­viewed last year, is re­tail­ing at $850,000, also be­fore COE.</p>
    <p>Elec­tric car sales zoom ahead in Nor­way</p>
    <p>The sale of elec­tric cars in Nor­way over­took those pow­ered by petrol, diesel and hy­brid en­gines last year, with Ger­many’s Audi re­plac­ing Tesla as the top bat­tery-ve­hi­cle brand, Reuters re­ported, cit­ing new data.</p>
    <p>Elec­tric cars made up 54.3 per cent of all new cars sold in the Nordic coun­try last year, a global record, up from 42.4 per cent in 2019 and from a mere 1 per cent a decade ago, ac­cord­ing to fig­ures from the Nor­we­gian Road Fed­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Seek­ing to be­come the first na­tion to end the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2025, oil-pro­duc­ing Nor­way ex­empts fully elec­tric ve­hi­cles from taxes im­posed on those re­ly­ing on fos­sil fu­els.</p>
    <p>The pol­icy has turned the coun­try’s car mar­ket into a lab­o­ra­tory for au­tomak­ers seek­ing a path to a fu­ture with­out in­ter­nal com­bus­tion en­gines, vault­ing new brands and mod­els to the top of best­seller lists in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>Volk­swa­gen’s Audi brand topped the 2020 leader board with its e-tron cross­over last year, while Tesla’s mid-sized Model 3, the 2019 win­ner, was rel­e­gated to sec­ond place.</p>
    <p>Honda Jazz in two vari­ants</p>
    <p>The lat­est Jazz from Honda has landed. Two vari­ants are avail­able – a hatch­back in two trim lev­els, and a tall hatch (Jazz e-HEV, above) with more ground clear­ance, equip­ment and a hy­brid driv­e­train.</p>
    <p>All have a 1.5-litre en­gine paired with a con­tin­u­ously vari­able trans­mis­sion, but the tall hy­brid hatch – as­sisted by two mo­tors pow­ered by a lithium-ion bat­tery – has a higher out­put.</p>
    <p>Prices start at $94,999. lected group of cus­tomers last Novem­ber, agent Wearnes Au­to­mo­tive reg­is­tered 11 units last month, push­ing As­ton Martin sales up by 30 per cent year on year – de­spite the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The DBX starts at $788,000 be­fore the cer­tifi­cate of en­ti­tle­ment.</p>
