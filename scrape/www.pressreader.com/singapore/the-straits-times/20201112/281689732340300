    <p>A sig­nif­i­cant re­design of Sin­ga­pore’s public sec­tor IT sys­tems will take place next year as part of new mea­sures to safe­guard cit­i­zens’ per­sonal data.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, in­ac­tive user ac­counts will be au­to­mat­i­cally re­moved when public ser­vants re­sign and leave. It is cur­rently a man­ual process.</p>
    <p>Such au­to­ma­tion across the public sec­tor is among 24 key rec­om­mended mea­sures by the Public Sec­tor Data Se­cu­rity Re­view Com­mit­tee (PSDSRC) that are be­ing rolled out af­ter a spate of breaches over the last two years.</p>
    <p>In the SingHealth cy­ber at­tack dis­closed in 2018, the at­tack­ers tar­geted in­ac­tive ad­min­is­tra­tor ac­counts, one of which had an eas­ily cracked pass­word.</p>
    <p>An­other new data se­cu­rity mea­sure will in­volve the use of tech­ni­cal and process con­trols to de­tect and stop risky user be­hav­iour, such as copy­ing sen­si­tive files from lap­tops. Users will be prompted to re­con­sider be­fore click­ing to pro­ceed, in or­der to pre­vent un­in­tended data leaks.</p>
    <p>This will plug gaps in ways sim­i­lar to how an al­ready in­stalled email con­trol had de­tected and stopped an at­tach­ment con­tain­ing the con­tact de­tails and ex­am­i­na­tion re­sults of 6,541 in­di­vid­u­als from be­ing ac­ci­den­tally sent by an of­fi­cer from the Sin­ga­pore Ac­coun­tancy Com­mis­sion to un­in­tended re­cip­i­ents last year.</p>
    <p>In its in­au­gu­ral an­nual re­port on the Gov­ern­ment’s per­sonal data pro­tec­tion ef­forts yes­ter­day, the Smart Na­tion and Dig­i­tal Gov­ern­ment Of­fice (SNDGO) said it is on track to roll out all 24 mea­sures by the end of 2023 as part of its $1 bil­lion in­vest­ment in data se­cu­rity. It has rolled out 18 mea­sures to date.</p>
    <p>Ex­plain­ing why some of the mea­sures can be im­ple­mented only next year, the SNDGO said: “Th­ese are larger and more com­plex pro­grammes which re­quire sig­nif­i­cant re-ar­chi­tect­ing of the tech­ni­cal sys­tems and would there­fore re­quire a longer lead time for im­ple­men­ta­tion.”</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the au­to­ma­tion of the re­moval or grant­ing of user ac­cess rights to public sec­tor IT sys­tems can be fully im­ple­mented across all 2,000 IT sys­tems only by end-2024.</p>
    <p>In the in­terim, a tech­ni­cal sys­tem will be used to alert agen­cies to staff move­ments and role changes so agen­cies can man­u­ally and promptly re­move in­ac­tive user ac­counts.</p>
    <p>The PSDSRC frame­work will re­place cur­rent prac­tices at public agen­cies, many of which have de­vised their own pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>The com­mit­tee was con­vened by Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong in March last year fol­low­ing a spate of cy­ber se­cu­rity breaches, in­clud­ing the SingHealth in­ci­dent in June 2018.</p>
    <p>Hack­ers then stole the data of 1.5 mil­lion pa­tients and the out­pa­tient pre­scrip­tion in­for­ma­tion of 160,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Also start­ing from March next year, all public agen­cies must carry out cy­ber and data se­cu­rity in­ci­dent drills an­nu­ally to en­sure they are pre­pared when breaches oc­cur.</p>
    <p>This com­ple­ments an­other mea­sure that was launched on the SNDGO web­site in April to al­low mem­bers of the public to re­port data breaches in­volv­ing public agen­cies.</p>
    <p>In its an­nual re­port, the SNDGO also high­lighted plans to pro­vide new guide­lines by the end of this year aimed at help­ing public agen­cies use bio­met­ric data re­spon­si­bly.</p>
    <p>“Bio­met­ric data is in­creas­ingly be­ing used as a con­ve­nient and se­cure form of iden­tity ver­i­fi­ca­tion for ac­cess to dig­i­tal ser­vices and se</p>
    <p>cure premises,” it said.</p>
    <p>An ex­am­ple of that is SingPass face ver­i­fi­ca­tion, which was launched in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>It al­lows peo­ple to scan their faces re­motely on their mo­bile phones to ver­ify who they are with</p>
    <p>out hav­ing to up­load pic­tures of their NRIC or show up in per­son to per­form ac­tions such as open­ing a bank ac­count.</p>
    <p>“Bio­met­ric data has unique char­ac­ter­is­tics that set it apart from other types of per­sonal data,” said</p>
    <p>the SNDGO in its re­port.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, bio­met­ric data is of­ten im­mutable, that is, it can­not be eas­ily re­placed once com­pro­mised.”</p>
    <p>SE­CUR­ING BIO­MET­RIC DATA</p>
    <p>Bio­met­ric data has unique char­ac­ter­is­tics that set it apart from other types of per­sonal data... For ex­am­ple, bio­met­ric data is of­ten im­mutable, that is, it can­not be eas­ily re­placed once com­pro­mised.</p>
