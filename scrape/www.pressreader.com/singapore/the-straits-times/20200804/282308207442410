    <p>There is a pleas­ing pic­ture from Sun­day in San Fran­cisco of an old tree look­ing on as an old cham­pion com­pletes a prac­tice swing. His body might be stiff but his 44-year-old swing has flow. There’s no one else in the photo ex­cept his cad­die, but any­way he of­ten looks like he’s locked into his own re­mote planet.</p>
    <p>It’s US PGA Cham­pi­onship week and pho­tog­ra­phers in­stinc­tively seek out this man as he feels out the course. Think of it as force of habit. Like lyrics and Bob Dy­lan, or mar­ble and Michelan­gelo, when it’s Ma­jors you think Tiger Woods. He could have den­tures and an ar­ti­fi­cial hip and we’d still look for him. An ath­lete is never greater than a game and yet his shadow can be so enor­mous it stays there even when his sun is set­ting.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day starts the year’s first Ma­jor which is played for a tro­phy with an in­tox­i­cat­ing past. Wal­ter Ha­gen, who was known to bring a hang­over to the first tee, lost the Wana­maker Tro­phy in the 1920s dur­ing a tri­umphant night of cel­e­bra­tion.</p>
    <p>Al­most a cen­tury later the 2013 cham­pion, Ja­son Dufner, de­clared to a ra­dio host that the tro­phy could hold 43 beers. Woods, of course, has only been in­ter­ested in the out­side of tro­phies. The place where the win­ner’s name is sten­cilled. His is there four times.</p>
    <p>The first win­ner of the PGA Cham­pi­onship in 1916 was a tall Cor­nish­man known as “Long Jim” Barnes and the last win­ner was a hefty chap named Brooks Koepka who looks like he bends iron as a party trick. Koepka won the ti­tle in 2018 and 2019 which is ter­rific, ex­cept that Woods won it con­sec­u­tively on two oc­ca­sions (1999-2000, 2006-07). As if to em­pha­sise he was twice as good as any­one else.</p>
    <p>But then Woods’ golf has never made log­i­cal sense and nei­ther still do his num­bers. On Mon­day when I started re­search­ing this ar­ti­cle the odds on him win­ning were 28-1. Two hours later on the same web­site they were 18-1. Magic? No, mem­ory.</p>
    <p>Per­haps the odd­s­mak­ers abruptly re­mem­bered who he was. Man with 15 Ma­jors and one of them last year. Sure, he’s not Tiger Woods as of­ten as he used to be, but he can still be that man dur­ing one or two weeks in a year.</p>
    <p>A lot of play­ers are in bet­ter form than Woods, who has had four com­pet­i­tive rounds in five months. A lot drive fur­ther than him – the course is 7,234 yards – like Bryson DeCham­beau, who leads the Tour with an av­er­age driv­ing dis­tance of 324.4 yards. A lot are hun­grier like Jon Rahm, who needs a first Ma­jor to jus­tify all the over­sized ad­jec­tives now stuck to him.</p>
    <p>There are watch­able hot­shots out there who weren’t even born when Woods turned pro in 1996. There’s</p>
    <p>Collin Morikawa, 23, of Ja­panese de­scent, who has two US Tour wins and had his break­fast menu stamped on his wedges. Sour­dough bread. Ba­con. Hash Browns. There’s Oslo-born Vik­tor Hov­land, 22, win­ner of the Puerto Rico Open in Fe­bru­ary, lover of chicken tikka masala, who said he’s never got an au­to­graph from any­one.</p>
    <p>And they’re go­ing to ben­e­fit from this sub­dued, no-spec­ta­tor, buzz-less, roar-free Ma­jor.</p>
    <p>Woods has a sniper’s fo­cus and he wouldn’t flinch if Me­tal­lica was hav­ing a con­cert near the 18th green, but this si­lence suits many play­ers. Ma­jors in­tim­i­date be­cause ev­ery­thing is in­flated, the hype, the crowds, the ques­tions, the sound, and in this case even the 12kg tro­phy. His­tory has a weight. But now this will be a golf­ing oxy­moron: The or­di­nary Ma­jor.</p>
    <p>There will be no Woods roar which froze ri­vals and no trail­ing army of fans, pho­tog­ra­phers, se­cu­rity which rat­tled play­ing part­ners. A virus has stripped the stage of awe. There is no mo­ment to mas­ter, only a course.</p>
    <p>And so if you take ev­ery­thing and weigh it, if you also con­sider his com­plain­ing back and the slim fair­ways, if you add an in-form Justin Thomas and an ea­ger Rory McIl­roy, if you cal­cu­late form and logic, then it’s clear. Tiger Woods can’t win the PGA Cham­pi­onship, but...</p>
    <p>And you al­ways leave your­self that “but”, a sort of small exit, a mi­nor hes­i­ta­tion, a re­fusal to com­mit com­pletely for fear of look­ing stupid, be­cause this is, well, Woods. Great ath­letes don’t just cre­ate what we can’t con­ceive, they ex­pect to.</p>
    <p>There is a de­li­cious anec­dote in a 2007 piece by the writer Joe Pos­nan­ski on Bo Jack­son, who was both a pro­fes­sional base­baller and grid­iron player. A re­porter once asked Jack­son, “What do you think of Bo Jack­son?” and got a bril­liant re­ply.</p>
    <p>“I’ve known this guy for years,” Jack­son said of Jack­son. “And noth­ing he does fazes me.”</p>
    <p>It’s how peo­ple feel about Woods. A win at the PGA Cham­pi­onship would be as­ton­ish­ing. And yet oddly not sur­pris­ing.</p>
    <p>There will be no Woods roar which froze ri­vals and no trail­ing army of fans, pho­tog­ra­phers, se­cu­rity which rat­tled play­ing part­ners. A virus has stripped the stage of awe. There is no mo­ment to mas­ter, only a course.</p>
