    <p>• An US$18 billion (S$23.7 billion) merger be­tween In­done­sia’s trans­porta­tion king Go­jek and e-com­merce gi­ant Toko­pe­dia would cre­ate the kind of cham­pion South-east Asia’s largest na­tion de­serves. The real syn­er­gies may be hid­den be­low the sur­face, just like the land­mines they face.</p>
    <p>Both are ready for a pos­si­ble deal, with a view to­wards an ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing, Bloomberg News re­ported yes­ter­day, with term sheets signed and due dili­gence next. A Jakarta list­ing is a near cer­tainty to show pa­tri­o­tism, while an over­seas sale – per­haps in New York – is also likely.</p>
    <p>With one side sell­ing prod­ucts on­line and the other de­liv­er­ing goods and peo­ple, the nat­u­ral sym­bio­sis would ap­pear to be through lo­gis­tics in a sprawl­ing coun­try that spans 5,100km across about 18,000 is­lands. That’s the kind of end-to-end in­fra­struc­ture that com­pa­nies like Ama­zon.com dream about.</p>
    <p>Yet the killer combo comes on the back end, in the fin­tech realm. Both firms, along with Go­jek ri­val Grab Hold­ings, are keen to ex­pand beyond their found­ing busi­ness mod­els into ser­vices such as pay­ments, bank­ing, in­sur­ance and loans. Ride-hail­ing provider Go­jek has over 190 mil­lion app down­loads across the re­gion, with its core mar­ket among In­done­sia’s 267 mil­lion peo­ple. Fin­tech will be the next growth driver. More than half the na­tion’s adults don’t even have a bank ac­count, Go­jek said.</p>
    <p>When con­sumers and busi­nesses are us­ing your apps to buy and sell prod­ucts, as well as book and de­liver trans­port, you’ve sud­denly got ac­cess to mil­lions of cus­tomers at mul­ti­ple touch points. This boosts sales and mar­ket­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties ex­po­nen­tially, and pro­vides a depth of data that few ri­vals can com­pete with.</p>
    <p>Throw in the re­quired reg­u­la­tory li­cences, and the pos­si­bil­ity of cre­at­ing a fi­nan­cial pow­er­house is right there. But so, too, is the po­ten­tial to mess it up.</p>
    <p>Merg­ers rarely go smoothly, and uni­corn marriages are even more un­usual. While now may be the per­fect time to hook up, since the growth of their core busi­nesses was al­ready set to slow even be­fore Covid-19 hit the broader econ­omy, the me­chan­ics and in­ter­nal fric­tion from a deal could threaten their mo­men­tum. Any shakeup of man­age­ment, job losses, sys­tems in­te­gra­tion, or clashes over di­rec­tion could dis­tract from the larger chal­lenges of tran­si­tion­ing into a gi­ant com­pany that’s re­ally ready for pub­lic scru­tiny.</p>
    <p>That’s not to say they shouldn’t try. In­done­sia, as the world’s fourth-most-pop­u­lous na­tion, de­serves a glo­ri­ous uni­corn wed­ding. But don’t be sur­prised if the cou­ple dis­cov­ers that mar­ried life isn’t al­ways bliss­ful.</p>
