    <p>A small num­ber of nightlife es­tab­lish­ments will be al­lowed to op­er­ate by next month or Jan­uary for two to three months, un­der a pi­lot scheme by the Gov­ern­ment to sup­port the flag­ging in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>These joints must, how­ever, adopt safe man­age­ment mea­sures, such as en­sur­ing cus­tomers wear masks even when singing. Cus­tomers of night­clubs and karaoke joints must also prove they have passed a Covid-19 test.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try and the Min­istry of Home Af­fairs said they are work­ing with as­so­ci­a­tions to iden­tify a small num­ber of nightlife busi­nesses to par­tic­i­pate in the pi­lots – up to 10 bars or pubs, 10 karaoke out­lets and five night­clubs.</p>
    <p>Es­tab­lish­ments can also get fi­nan­cial sup­port pack­ages to ei­ther pivot their op­er­a­tions, or exit the in­dus­try with a one-off pay­ment and re­trench­ment ben­e­fits sup­port.</p>
    <p>Se­lected nightlife venues will be able to re­open by next month or Jan­uary un­der strict safe man­age­ment mea­sures – such as wear­ing masks on the dance floor and show­ing proof of neg­a­tive Covid-19 tests be­fore en­ter­ing – as part of a twoto three-month pi­lot pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>This an­nounce­ment by the Gov­ern­ment yes­ter­day comes about nine months into the clo­sure of nightlife venues like clubs, karaoke joints and bars with­out food li­cences – which has seen many busi­nesses crip­pled and even clos­ing down.</p>
    <p>In the first six months of the year, 59 night­clubs, dis­cothe­ques, dance clubs and karaoke out­lets wound up, ac­cord­ing to the Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Au­thor­ity.</p>
    <p>There are about 4,000 pubs, bars, clubs and en­ter­tain­ment out­lets, es­ti­mated to be em­ploy­ing al­most 50,000 peo­ple within and out­side the in­dus­try, said the Sin­ga­pore Nightlife Busi­ness As­so­ci­a­tion (SNBA).</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try (MTI) and the Min­istry of Home Af­fairs (MHA) said in a joint state­ment that they are “work­ing with var­i­ous nightlife busi­ness as­so­ci­a­tions to iden­tify a small num­ber of nightlife es­tab­lish­ments to par­tic­i­pate in the pi­lots”.</p>
    <p>The pi­lot for pubs and bars is ex­pected to kick off by next month and last two months.</p>
    <p>But the pi­lot for karaoke es­tab­lish­ments and night­clubs will be­gin only by Jan­uary to let them put in place mea­sures to en­sure cus­tomers test neg­a­tive for Covid-19 within the pre­vi­ous 24 hours via a poly­merase chain re­ac­tion test or an anti­gen rapid test.</p>
    <p>This could be tests by the busi­nesses on-site, or a re­quire­ment for cus­tomers to visit clin­ics pro­vid­ing this ser­vice be­fore pa­tro­n­is­ing the nightlife joints.</p>
    <p>The pi­lot for karaoke joints and night­clubs will also last longer – for three months, as more time is needed to as­sess the readi­ness of the in­dus­try to re­open. This is in view of “much higher risks and the more strin­gent safe man­age­ment mea­sures re­quired”.</p>
    <p>WEL­COME MOVE</p>
    <p>This is some­thing we were look­ing out for… The Gov­ern­ment has done a very com­pre­hen­sive as­sess­ment, and the solutions are thought­ful. It will not sat­isfy ev­ery­one, es­pe­cially the big­ger op­er­a­tors, but (the Gov­ern­ment is) try­ing to help the small com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>SIN­GA­PORE NIGHTLIFE BUSI­NESS AS­SO­CI­A­TION PRES­I­DENT JOSEPH ONG, on the Gov­ern­ment’s ini­tia­tives to help nightlife es­tab­lish­ments.</p>
    <p>Strict safe man­age­ment mea­sures will in­clude en­sur­ing all cus­tomers wear masks at all times, even while on the dance floor or singing at karaoke joints. They can re­move masks only while eat­ing and drink­ing.</p>
    <p>Al­co­hol can­not be sold, served or con­sumed af­ter 10.30pm as well.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tion­ally, closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion cam­eras cov­er­ing all com­mon ar­eas and rooms used for ac­tiv­i­ties must be ac­ti­vated.</p>
    <p>Those who breach the mea­sures will not only face penal­ties un­der Covid-19 rules, but may be re­moved from the pi­lot too.</p>
    <p>MTI and MHA have en­gaged key stake­hold­ers and will al­low nightlife as­so­ci­a­tions to nom­i­nate busi­nesses to join the pi­lots.</p>
    <p>They will then jointly as­sess the nom­i­nees, tak­ing into con­sid­er­a­tion their pro­pos­als to im­ple­ment the pre­scribed safe man­age­ment mea­sures, and their pro­file or type of busi­ness to en­sure di­ver­sity among the com­pa­nies in the pi­lots.</p>
    <p>They may also con­sider es­tab­lish­ments with eco­nomic or so­cial sig­nif­i­cance that are strongly sup­ported by other public agen­cies.</p>
    <p>Nightlife joints not in the pi­lots will get fi­nan­cial sup­port to let them ei­ther pivot to other busi­ness lines or exit with a one-off pay­ment.</p>
    <p>Those that wish to pivot to food and bev­er­age or other com­mer­cial uses such as of­fices or gyms can ap­ply for a grant of up to $50,000 from En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG) un­til March 31. This is to help cover costs in­curred dur­ing the process. For joints that have al­ready piv­oted, ESG will of­fer sup­port on a case-by-case ba­sis.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses look­ing to exit can ap­ply to ESG un­til March 31 for an ex gra­tia pay­ment of $30,000 to de­fray the costs of ces­sa­tion of busi­ness. For re­trench­ment ben­e­fits paid to lo­cal staff, em­ploy­ers can seek fi­nan­cial sup­port for one month of salary paid to each worker.</p>
    <p>If firms choose to re­ceive ei­ther fi­nan­cial sup­port pack­age, they can­not par­tic­i­pate in the pi­lot schemes or re­sume nightlife op­er­a­tions for at least 12 months.</p>
    <p>SNBA pres­i­dent Joseph Ong wel­comed the Gov­ern­ment’s ini­tia­tives, adding: “This is some­thing we were look­ing out for… The Gov­ern­ment has done a very com­pre­hen­sive as­sess­ment, and the solutions are thought­ful.</p>
    <p>“It will not sat­isfy ev­ery­one, es­pe­cially the big­ger op­er­a­tors, but (the Gov­ern­ment is) try­ing to help the small com­pa­nies.”</p>
