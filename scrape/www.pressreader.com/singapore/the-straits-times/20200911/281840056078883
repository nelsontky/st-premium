    <p>•</p>
    <p>HANOI De­vel­op­ments in the South China Sea took cen­tre stage at a meet­ing of rep­re­sen­ta­tives of Asean yes­ter­day, with Viet­nam say­ing South-east Asian coun­tries want the United States to play a role in main­tain­ing peace in the con­tested area.</p>
    <p>“We wel­come the US’ con­struc­tive and re­spon­sive con­tri­bu­tions to Asean’s ef­forts to main­tain­ing the peace, sta­bil­ity and de­vel­op­ments in the South China Sea,” Viet­nam For­eign Min­is­ter Pham Binh Minh said at the vir­tual meet­ing be­tween the 10 Asean mem­bers and US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam, which holds the re­gional bloc’s ro­tat­ing chair­man­ship, said South-east Asian coun­tries were open to op­por­tu­ni­ties for prac­ti­cal co­op­er­a­tion with the US in the re­gion, push­ing back against China’s ear­lier com­ments that Amer­i­can forces were desta­bil­is­ing the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam, the Philip­pines, Brunei and Malaysia have been locked in ter­ri­to­rial dis­putes with China that have im­pacted their abil­ity to ex­tract fish, oil and gas from off­shore ar­eas. China claims the ma­jor­ity of the South China Sea, in­vok­ing its so-called nine-dash line to jus­tify what it says are his­toric rights to the key trade wa­ter­way.</p>
    <p>At a vir­tual meet­ing a day ear­lier, Chi­nese For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi told South-east Asian for­eign min­is­ters that the US was in­ter­ven­ing in ter­ri­to­rial dis­putes and strength­en­ing its mil­i­tary de­ploy­ment in the con­tested area “out of its own po­lit­i­cal pur­poses”.</p>
    <p>He called the US “the big­gest driver of mil­i­tari­sa­tion of the South China Sea”, ac­cord­ing to state­ments posted by China’s For­eign Min­istry. “Peace and sta­bil­ity are China’s great­est strate­gic in­ter­est in the South China Sea, which are also the com­mon as­pi­ra­tion of Asean coun­tries,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Pom­peo yes­ter­day urged South-east Asia to cut ties with Chi­nese com­pa­nies help­ing to build is­lands in the South China Sea, weeks af­ter the US black­listed two dozen firms work­ing in the re­source-rich wa­ter­way.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo said it was time for South-east Asian govern­ments to re­con­sider their own re­la­tion­ship with firms work­ing in the sea.</p>
    <p>“Don’t just speak up, but act,” he told the 10 Asean for­eign min­is­ters dur­ing the meet­ing.</p>
    <p>“Re­con­sider busi­ness deal­ings with the very state-owned com­pa­nies that bully Asean coastal states in the South China Sea... Don’t let the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party walk over us and our peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Philip­pines had al­ready said last week that it would not fol­low the US lead be­cause it needed Chi­nese in­vest­ment, even as a fresh dis­pute be­tween the two na­tions over Scar­bor­ough Shoal – one of the re­gion’s rich­est fish­ing grounds – hangs over the talks.</p>
    <p>In a joint state­ment re­leased late yes­ter­day, Asean mem­ber states said progress had been made in ne­go­ti­a­tions to draft a code of con­duct in the South China Sea that was con­sis­tent with in­ter­na­tional law, in­clud­ing the 1982 United Na­tions Con­ven­tion on the Law of the Sea, to which China is a sig­na­tory.</p>
    <p>“Con­cerns were ex­pressed by some min­is­ters on the land recla­ma­tions, ac­tiv­i­ties and se­ri­ous in­ci­dents i n the area, which have eroded trust and con­fi­dence, in­creased ten­sions, and may un­der­mine peace, se­cu­rity and sta­bil­ity in the re­gion,” the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>Ten­sions in the South China Sea have risen in the past few months as the US and China spar on ev­ery­thing from democ­racy in Hong Kong to data se­cu­rity over pop­u­lar Chi­nese apps TikTok and WeChat.</p>
    <p>In July, Wash­ing­ton ex­plic­itly re­jected Bei­jing’s ex­pan­sive mar­itime claims in the re­gion for the first time, and sent air­craft car­ri­ers to the wa­ters to con­duct mil­i­tary ex­er­cises.</p>
    <p>China last month fired mis­siles into the South China Sea, dis­play­ing its abil­ity to strike at US bases and air­craft car­ri­ers, the ma­jor sources of Amer­i­can power pro­jec­tion in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>While the Asean meet­ings this week ap­peared to be over­shad­owed by US-China ri­valry, the mem­ber states also had fruit­ful di­a­logue with other na­tions.</p>
    <p>Singapore For­eign Min­is­ter Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan said in a Face­book post yes­ter­day that sub­stan­tive con­ver­sa­tions were had with the US, Canada, Aus­tralia and New Zealand about con­tin­u­ing co­op­er­a­tion in the ar­eas of pub­lic health, sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment, trade, in­no­va­tion and dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
