    <p>Work is un­der way to re­fresh Sin­ga­pore’s plans for trans­form­ing the econ­omy, said Deputy Prime Min­is­ter and Fi­nance Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day, Mr Heng ad­dressed sug­ges­tions from sev­eral MPs on pol­icy changes that will help busi­nesses seize op­por­tu­ni­ties amid the dis­rup­tions caused by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Mr Ed­ward Chia (Hol­land-Bukit Timah GRC) said the pan­demic was dis­rupt­ing global sup­ply chains, and this was a good op­por­tu­nity for lo­cal firms to ex­pand into the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng agreed. To help busi­nesses keen on do­ing so, he said there are schemes that can help, like the Market Readi­ness As­sis­tance Grant, En­ter­prise De­vel­op­ment Grant and Dou­ble Tax De­duc­tion for In­ter­na­tion­al­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Chia also said in­no­va­tion in lo­cal firms can be bol­stered by tech­nol­ogy and de­sign, which will help them stand out. Mr Heng said there is a need for firms here to work to­gether across in­dus­tries to in­no­vate, and noted sim­i­lar points made by Ms Jes­sica Tan (East Coast GRC) and Mr Shawn Huang (Jurong GRC).</p>
    <p>Mr Heng also en­cour­aged firms to tap the Gov­ern­ment’s Open In­no­va­tion Plat­form, which al­lows busi­nesses to crowd­source in­no­va­tive so­lu­tions from more than 9,000 com­pa­nies for their prob­lems.</p>
    <p>Such ef­forts, he added, are part of moves to re­fresh the sec­tor-spe­cific in­dus­try trans­for­ma­tion maps (ITMs) – in­tro­duced in 2016 to spell out spe­cific plans to pro­mote in­no­va­tion, deepen ca­pa­bil­i­ties and en­cour­age links be­tween com­ple­men­tary in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>He said: “We are con­sult­ing widely across in­dus­tries and firms as we re­fresh our ITMs.”</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ja­mus Lim (Sengkang GRC) also spoke about ac­ti­vat­ing a Plan B to get lo­cal firms to trans­form and go re­gional.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Mr Heng said: “The fact of the mat­ter is that this eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion has been our plan all along. And in fact, all these years, we have been rein­vent­ing our econ­omy over and over again.”</p>
    <p>There are also op­por­tu­ni­ties for firms in the push for sus­tain­abil­ity, he added, cit­ing a point made by Ms Ch­eryl Chan (East Coast GRC) ear­lier on the im­por­tance of equip­ping work­ers with the rel­e­vant skills for the sus­tain­abil­ity sec­tor.</p>
    <p>That is why Sin­ga­pore has set up the En­ergy Ef­fi­ciency Tech­nol­ogy Cen­tre, which of­fers pro­grammes to train Sin­ga­pore­ans in these sec­tors, said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre, which was launched last year and cost $5 mil­lion to set up, also helps small and medi­um­sized en­ter­prises as­sess their en­ergy ef­fi­ciency and im­prove their en­ergy per­for­mance.</p>
