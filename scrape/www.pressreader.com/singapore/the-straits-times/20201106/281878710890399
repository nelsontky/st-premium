    <p>Mr Christophe­r Boch­enek, whose Sur­vey for Tran­sient As­tro­nom­i­cal Ra­dio Emis­sion 2 (Stare2) in the US was one of the teams to spot the burst... said the burst was “so bright” that the­o­ret­i­cally if you had a record­ing of the raw data from your mo­bile phone’s 4G LTE re­ceiver and knew what to look for, “you might have found this sig­nal that came about half­way across the gal­axy” in the phone data.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>Astro­physi­cists have de­tected a burst of cos­mic ra­dio waves within our gal­axy for the first time and iden­ti­fied its source, ac­cord­ing to re­search pub­lished on Wed­nes­day that sheds new light on one of the mys­ter­ies of the uni­verse.</p>
    <p>The ori­gin of pow­er­ful fast ra­dio bursts (FRBs) – in­tense flashes of ra­dio emis­sion that last only a few mil­lisec­onds – have puz­zled sci­en­tists since they were first de­tected a lit­tle over a decade ago.</p>
    <p>They are typ­i­cally ex­tra-ga­lac­tic, mean­ing they orig­i­nate out­side our gal­axy, but on April 28, mul­ti­ple tele­scopes de­tected a bright FRB from the same area within our Milky Way.</p>
    <p>Im­por­tantly, they were also able to pin down the source: ga­lac­tic mag­ne­tar SGR 1935+2154.</p>
    <p>Mag­ne­tars, young neu­tron stars that are the most mag­netic ob­jects in the uni­verse, have long been prime sus­pects in the hunt for the source of these ra­dio bursts.</p>
    <p>But this dis­cov­ery marks the first time that astronomer­s have been able to di­rectly trace the sig­nal back to a mag­ne­tar.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Mr Christophe­r Boch­enek, whose Sur­vey for Tran­sient As­tro­nom­i­cal Ra­dio Emis­sion 2 (Stare2) in the United States was one of the teams to spot the burst, the mag­ne­tar emit­ted in about one mil­lisec­ond as much en­ergy as the Sun’s ra­dio waves do in 30 sec­onds.</p>
    <p>He said the burst was “so bright” that the­o­ret­i­cally if you had a record­ing of the raw data from your mo­bile phone’s 4G LTE re­ceiver and knew what to look for, “you might have found this sig­nal that came about half­way across the gal­axy” in the phone data. This en­ergy was com­pa­ra­ble to FRBs from out­side the gal­axy, he said, strength­en­ing the case for mag­ne­tars to be the source of most ex­tra­galac­tic bursts.</p>
    <p>As many as 10,000 FRBs may oc­cur ev­ery day, but these high-en­ergy surges were dis­cov­ered only in 2007. They have been the topic of heated de­bate ever since, with even small steps to­wards iden­ti­fy­ing their ori­gin stir­ring ma­jor ex­cite­ment for astronomer­s.</p>
    <p>One prob­lem is that the mo­men­tary flashes are hard to pin­point with­out know­ing where to look.</p>
    <p>The­o­ries of their origins have ranged from cat­a­strophic events like su­per­novas to neu­tron stars, which are su­per-dense stel­lar frag­ments formed af­ter the grav­i­ta­tional col­lapse of a star. There are even more ex­otic ex­pla­na­tions – dis­counted by astronomer­s – of ex­tra-ter­res­trial sig­nals.</p>
    <p>The lat­est dis­cov­ery, which was pub­lished in three pa­pers in the journal Na­ture, was made by piec­ing to­gether ob­ser­va­tions from space and ground-based tele­scopes. Both Stare2 and the Cana­dian Hy­dro­gen In­ten­sity Map­ping Ex­per­i­ment spot­ted the flare and at­trib­uted it to the mag­ne­tar.</p>
    <p>Later the same day, this re­gion of the sky came into view of the ex­tremely sen­si­tive 500m Aper­ture Spher­i­cal Tele­scope in China.</p>
    <p>Astronomer­s there were al­ready keep­ing an eye on the mag­ne­tar, which had en­tered an “ac­tive phase” and was fir­ing off X-ray and gamma ray bursts, ac­cord­ing to Pro­fes­sor Bing Zhang, a re­searcher at the Univer­sity of Ne­vada and part of the team re­port­ing on the dis­cov­ery.</p>
