    <p>AU­TO­BI­O­GRAPH­I­CAL FIC­TION WHO THEY WAS</p>
    <p>By Gabriel Krauze</p>
    <p>4th Es­tate/Pa­per­back/332 pages/ $28.35/Avail­able at bit.ly/WhoTW_GK</p>
    <p>The first thing that may catch your at­ten­tion is the novel’s gram­mat­i­cally in­cor­rect ti­tle, but it re­flects the in­con­gruity in au­thor Gabriel Krauze’s life.</p>
    <p>Who They Was is in­cred­i­bly raw, with Krauze draw­ing on his own ex­pe­ri­ences in his de­but semi-au­to­bi­o­graph­i­cal novel, which was long-listed for the Booker Prize this year.</p>
    <p>Krauze, as his pro­file on the Booker Prize web­site reads, was per­son­ally “heav­ily in­volved in gangs, guns, stab­bing and rob­bery, all while com­plet­ing an English de­gree at Queen Mary’s Univer­sity”. Now 34, he draws on his ex­pe­ri­ences be­tween the ages of 18 and 22 in this adren­a­line-charged novel, which opens with a mug­ging and blurs the line be­tween fact and fic­tion.</p>
    <p>Born in Bri­tain to Pol­ish im­mi­grants, Krauze – like his per­sona in the novel – is known as Snoopz to his friends, Gabriel to his fam­ily and class­mates, and Mr Krauze to authority fig­ures like pa­role of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>Krauze writes about a youth who is ad­dicted to crime and drugs, all while jug­gling univer­sity course­work. The nar­ra­tor, who makes no apolo­gies for his crimes and takes a cav­a­lier at­ti­tude to­wards vi­o­lence, is ar­rested sev­eral times but de­cides to put his thug life be­hind him upon grad­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>This mir­rors Krauze’s life story. As he told news out­let Vice in an in­ter­view: “Read­ers are sup­posed to feel hor­ri­fied.”</p>
    <p>The novel is an ef­fec­tive so­cial com­men­tary on dis­crim­i­na­tion and poverty, and the fac­tors that might push youth to join a gang.</p>
    <p>Krauze writes about the fa­tal shoot­ing of an ac­quain­tance in his neigh­bour­hood of South Kilburn – a low-in­come district no­to­ri­ous for gang wars and a ram­pant drug trade in real life – that is barely in­ves­ti­gated by the po­lice. In ironic con­trast, the po­lice had been quick to re­spond to one of his rob­bery vic­tims.</p>
    <p>His prose is pep­pered with London street slang that adds real­ism to the book. Guys are “br­ers” and girls are “gyals” to Snoopz, who spends a lot of time “bun­ning it up (to) get mad charged” (smok­ing weed to get high) and “cotch­ing with man­dem in da endz” (hang­ing out with his mates in the neigh­bour­hood).</p>
    <p>But the lan­guage turns for­mal as he gets philo­soph­i­cal. Mus­ing on Ni­et­zsche’s The Birth Of Tragedy af­ter a night of vi­o­lent crime, he says: “Moral­ity is just a rule of be­hav­iour rel­a­tive to the level of dan­ger in which an in­di­vid­ual lives.</p>
    <p>“If you’re liv­ing in dan­ger­ous times, you can’t af­ford to live ac­cord­ing to moral struc­tures the way some­one who lives in safety and peace can.”</p>
    <p>Who They Was is not the breezi­est of reads and is po­lar­is­ing in its shock­ing amoral­ity.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics will say the book un­apolo­get­i­cally glam­or­ises and jus­ti­fies vi­o­lence, but it also gives a look into the mind of a street­wise, books­mart man who chooses a life of crime in his for­ma­tive years.</p>
    <p>If you like this, read: The Young Team by Graeme Arm­strong (Pi­cador, 2020, $31.36, avail­able at bit.ly/they­oungteam). The de­but novel of Scot­tish au­thor Graeme Arm­strong, told in lo­cal twang, is based on his real-life ex­pe­ri­ences, from join­ing a gang at 14 to his re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion from drug ad­dic­tion at 21.</p>
