    <p>Civil wars cast long shad­ows.</p>
    <p>And when Mr Le­var Stoney, the mayor of Rich­mond, Vir­ginia, took the podium for a press con­fer­ence on June 4, he be­gan with words that spoke of the ori­gin of that dark­ness.</p>
    <p>“It’s time,” he said. “Rich­mond is no longer the cap­i­tal of the Con­fed­er­acy.”</p>
    <p>It was time to “re­place the racist sym­bols of op­pres­sion and in­equal­ity... sym­bols that have lit­er­ally dom­i­nated our land­scape”.</p>
    <p>His cam­paign to re­move the city’s Con­fed­er­ate stat­ues came just weeks af­ter the death of African Amer­i­can Ge­orge Floyd.</p>
    <p>Mr Floyd died pinned to the ground, with a Min­nesota po­lice of­fi­cer’s knee on his neck. His killing was filmed and trig­gered out­rage not just in the United States, but through­out the world.</p>
    <p>Mr Floyd’s graphic death on May 25 hit a na­tion primed for out­rage with full force. In 2017, just eight months into the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion and in a chill­ing throw­back to a dark era for black peo­ple, torch-car­ry­ing white su­prem­a­cists marched in Char­lottesvill­e and fought with counter-pro­test­ers leav­ing one lo­cal woman, Ms Heather Heyer, dead.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent rocked the coun­try and Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s re­sponse that there were “fine peo­ple… on both sides” prompted for­mer vice-pres­i­dent Joe Biden to run for the White House.</p>
    <p>Black Lives Mat­ter as a move­ment has been gain­ing mo­men­tum for some years, with anger mount­ing for ev­ery black per­son shot by the po­lice. But Mr Floyd’s death – for the of­fence of try­ing to use a US$20 coun­ter­feit bill – in­jected a new sense of pur­pose and brought not just black but also white peo­ple onto the streets. Rage at gen­er­a­tions of in­jus­tice found a fo­cus.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands across Amer­ica, across the colour di­vide of an in­creas­ingly di­verse na­tion, took to the streets. Many chanted the names of African Amer­i­cans who have died at the hands of the po­lice. But this was a broader rebel</p>
    <p>lion against the darker as­pects of Amer­ica’s his­tory.</p>
    <p>In Bos­ton, Mas­sachusetts, a statue of Christo­pher Colum­bus – for many the orig­i­nal colo­nial­ist – was be­headed and later re­moved. Across the coun­try, pro­test­ers tried to tear down stat­ues of colo­nial­ists, slave own­ers and con­fed­er­ate of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>Black Lives Mat­ter marches also took place in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>In Bris­tol, Eng­land, a statue of 17th-cen­tury slave trader Ed­ward Col­ston was top­pled and dumped into the sea on June 7.</p>
    <p>“This city needs to change,” de­clared black Bris­tol rap­per Wish Mas­ter.</p>
    <p>“Ask any black per­son here to­day and they will tell you about racism,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mon­u­ments be­came fo­cal points in this fight. The US civil war ended in 1865, but no clo­sure was to be had. The strug­gle for civil rights con­tin­ued for 100 years dur­ing which there was a wave of Con­fed­er­acy mon­u­ment-build­ing, in­ter­preted by his­to­ri­ans and ac­tivists to be a mes­sage to black Amer­i­cans: Know your place.</p>
    <p>There are 1,800 sym­bols of the Con­fed­er­acy across 31 states, in­clud­ing 830 stat­ues. Half those stat­ues were put up in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The “lost cause” mythology – wist­ful think­ing of an imag­ined rosy past – gained ground.</p>
    <p>Georgia’s Stone Moun­tain Park, which fea­tures enor­mous carv­ings of three Con­fed­er­ate lead­ers – Jef­fer­son Davis, Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jack­son – is con­sid­ered a mon­u­ment to white supremacy.</p>
    <p>It was ded­i­cated as re­cently as 1968.</p>
    <p>Across the US, Black Lives Mat­ter demon­stra­tions have oc­ca­sion­ally turned vi­o­lent. Mostly af­ter dark, af­ter peace­ful pro­test­ers had dis­persed, right wing and left wing have bat­tled it out in the streets of Port­land, Ore­gon and other cities.</p>
    <p>In the lex­i­con of Pres­i­dent Trump, Black Lives Mat­ter pro­test­ers be­came left­ists, al­lied with rad­i­cal so­cial­ists in an at­tempt to erase Amer­ica’s proud past. Right-wing groups have turned up armed. Some white su­prem­a­cist groups want an­other civil war.</p>
    <p>Much of the Black Lives Mat­ter move­ment is about re­claim­ing pub­lic space. In Char­lottesvill­e, the ri­ots fo­cused on a statue of Con­fed­er­ate gen­eral Robert E. Lee in a small leafy city park.</p>
    <p>Af­ter pe­ti­tions and de­bates, the city coun­cil voted to have it re­moved; white su­prem­a­cists gath­ered to re­sist its re­moval.</p>
    <p>But on Mon­day, work­ers in the stat­u­ary hall of the US Capi­tol re­moved an­other statue of the very same Robert E. Lee. A com­mis­sion set up by the gover­nor of Vir­ginia had con­cluded that a man who fought to up­hold slav­ery was not a fit­ting sym­bol for the state.</p>
    <p>It was a quiet event, but it marked a sig­nif­i­cant vic­tory for Black Lives Mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Lee’s statue will be re­placed by one of Bar­bara Johns, a black woman and a civil rights ac­tivist.</p>
