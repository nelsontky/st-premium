    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Black Pan­ther star Chad­wick Bose­man’s death from colon can­cer at the age of 43 has high­lighted the growing rate of this dis­ease among younger adults, who are of­ten di­ag­nosed at later stages.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Dr Kim­mie Ng, di­rec­tor of Dana-Far­ber’s Young-On­set Col­orec­tal Can­cer Cen­tre in Bos­ton, it shows how im­por­tant it is for more re­search into what is driv­ing the rise, as well as greater aware­ness and screen­ing. “We are los­ing way too many young lives to this dis­ease with­out a clear un­der­stand­ing of what the causes are,” she said.</p>
    <p>The sus­pi­cion is that en­vi­ron­men­tal fac­tors, such as shifts in di­ets and lifestyle, could be be­hind the in­crease.</p>
    <p>While stud­ies are un­der way, statis­tics in the United States are alarm­ing and the trend is sim­i­lar in Europe.</p>
    <p>Since 1994, US cases of young-on­set col­orec­tal can­cer – de­fined as a di­ag­no­sis be­fore the age of 50 – have in­creased by 50 per cent.</p>
    <p>Col­orec­tal can­cers will af­fect more than 140,000 Amer­i­cans this year, with un­der-50s ac­count­ing for about 11 per cent of colon can­cers and 18 per cent of rec­tal can­cers. By 2030, the rates among this age group are ex­pected to dou­ble and quadru­ple re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the Amer­i­can Can­cer So­ci­ety re­cently up­dated its ad­vice, say­ing most peo­ple should get screened at 45, not 50.</p>
    <p>Symp­toms to watch for in­clude changes to bowel habits that last more than a few days, such as di­ar­rhoea, con­sti­pa­tion or nar­row stool.</p>
    <p>They also in­clude feel­ings of hav­ing to pass stool that do not go away by do­ing so, rec­tal bleed­ing or blood in the stool, ab­dom­i­nal pain, weak­ness, fa­tigue and weight loss.</p>
    <p>For Mr David Thau, it took shoot­ing pain in the ab­domen – the worst he had ever felt in his life – for him to go see his pri­mary care doc­tor in June last year.</p>
    <p>The Wash­ing­ton-based po­lit­i­cal con­sul­tant, then 34, had been ig­nor­ing the blood that had re­cently been ap­pear­ing in his stool.</p>
    <p>“I’ve al­ways been the kind of per­son who just says, ‘Well, I don’t need to go to the doc­tor,’” he said .</p>
    <p>A former high school ath­lete, he was oth­er­wise healthy with no family his­tory of colon can­cer.</p>
    <p>Mr Thau’s doc­tor told him he might have an ul­cer or ap­pen­dici­tis, so he checked into an emer­gency room.</p>
    <p>A CT scan de­tected a 7.5cm mass that al­most com­pletely blocked his colon. He was di­ag­nosed as hav­ing stage 3C can­cer, the last be­fore a can­cer has metas­ta­sised, and days later had surgery to re­move the tu­mour.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, sur­geons were able to ex­tract it us­ing small in­ci­sions and he did not re­quire an ileostomy – a sur­gi­cal open­ing to a bag that holds stool. For the next six months, he trav­elled to Bos­ton ev­ery other week for chemo­ther­apy.</p>
    <p>“I had to freeze my sperm,” added Mr Thau, since he and his wife were plan­ning to have chil­dren and the treat­ment can cause steril­ity.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary, doc­tors said his can­cer was gone, but he still re­quires rou­tine check-ups.</p>
    <p>Ms Ghaz­ala Sid­diqui, from Hous­ton, went to an emer­gency room in March 2018 af­ter find­ing it im­pos­si­ble to pass stool de­spite us­ing lax­a­tives.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors per­formed an X-ray on the mother of two, then 41, but mis­di­ag­nosed her case as se­vere con­sti­pa­tion and sent her home.</p>
    <p>It was not un­til she ap­proached a spe­cial­ist that colon can­cer was iden­ti­fied. She needed 23 gru­elling ra­di­a­tion ses­sions at MD An­der­son Can­cer Cen­tre to shrink the stage 3 tu­mour down to size be­fore it could be re­moved. She also needed an ileostomy and a stool bag.</p>
    <p>Next came months of chemo­ther­apy and un­cer­tainty as to whether her bow­els would ever re­cover enough for the bag to be re­moved.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, it did, and in Fe­bru­ary last year, the colon was sur­gi­cally closed.</p>
    <p>Ms Sid­diqui said the hard­est as­pect was that the ra­di­a­tion caused her to go through early menopause, caus­ing hot flushes, loss of sex drive and on­go­ing anx­i­ety.</p>
    <p>Af­ter her ex­pe­ri­ence, her four sis­ters un­der­went screen­ing. One had polyps the size of al­monds which doc­tors were able to re­move early, “which goes to show that screen­ing is im­por­tant”, she said.</p>
    <p>Dr Ng em­pha­sised it is crit­i­cal to catch growths early and to con­sider screen­ing even ear­lier than 45 if there is family his­tory of colon can­cer or ad­vanced polyps.</p>
    <p>Colono­scopies are con­sid­ered the gold stan­dard of screen­ing, but their in­va­sive na­ture can dis­cour­age some peo­ple. For this rea­son, Dr Ng’s cen­tre is work­ing on what it hopes will be the next gen­er­a­tion of blood and stool tests that might catch growths sooner.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately though, “the best screen­ing test is the screen­ing test that gets done”, she said. “If some­body is hav­ing symp­toms con­cern­ing colon can­cer, they need to seek med­i­cal at­ten­tion.”</p>
    <p>The last tweet from late Amer­i­can ac­tor Chad­wick Bose­man’s ac­count an­nounc­ing the 43-year-old’s death from colon can­cer is now the most­liked tweet of all time, ac­cord­ing to Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter an­nounced it with a retweet of the post: “Most liked Tweet ever. A trib­ute fit for a King. #WakandaFor­ever,” ref­er­enc­ing the ac­tor’s most fa­mous role to date – the tit­u­lar su­per­hero in Black Pan­ther (2018) and the king of a fic­tional African na­tion known as Wakanda.</p>
    <p>The tweet, which posted a blackand-white photo of Bose­man along­side a statement an­nounc­ing his death and a pre­vi­ously undis­closed colon can­cer di­ag­no­sis, has more than 6.2 mil­lion likes and three mil­lion retweets. It was posted at 10.11am Sin­ga­pore time on Saturday.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has also re­in­stated the Black Pan­ther hash­tag emoji fol­low­ing Bose­man’s death.</p>
    <p>The pre­vi­ously most-liked tweet of all time was from former United States pres­i­dent Barack Obama’s ac­count.</p>
    <p>Mr Obama tweeted a Nelson Man­dela quote in Au­gust 2017, in the wake of the Char­lottesvill­e, Vir­ginia, car at­tack in which a man drove his car into a crowd of peace­ful pro­test­ers who had been protest­ing against white su­prem­a­cists.</p>
    <p>It read: “No one is born hat­ing an­other per­son be­cause of the colour of his skin or his back­ground or his re­li­gion.”</p>
    <p>The tweet has 4.3 mil­lion likes and 1.6 mil­lion retweets.</p>
    <p>Bose­man was an iconic ac­tor to African-Amer­i­cans, por­tray­ing sev­eral im­por­tant his­tor­i­cal fig­ures in the com­mu­nity, such as base­ball player Jackie Robinson in 42 (2013), soul singer James Brown in Get On Up (2014), and Supreme Court jus­tice Thur­good Mar­shall in Mar­shall (2017).</p>
