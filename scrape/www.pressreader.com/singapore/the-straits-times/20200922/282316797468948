    <p>TOKYO • A con­sult­ing firm hired by Tokyo’s Olympic bid com­mit­tee paid some US$367,000 (S$503,000) to the son of an In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee (IOC) mem­ber be­fore and af­ter the Ja­panese cap­i­tal was picked to host the Games, re­ports said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The claims come as the French au­thor­i­ties probe an al­leged vote-buy­ing scan­dal, cen­tring on US$2 mil­lion paid by the Tokyo bid panel to</p>
    <p>Black Tid­ings, a Sin­ga­pore-based firm linked to Sene­galese na­tional Papa Mas­sata Diack. He is the son of Lamine Diack, the for­mer head of the In­ter­na­tional As­so­ci­a­tion of Ath­let­ics Fed­er­a­tions, (IAAF) – now re­named World Ath­let­ics.</p>
    <p>Diack se­nior was also a mem­ber of the IOC and said to have in­flu­ence over African votes at the time of the Tokyo bid in Septem­ber 2013 to host the 2020 Games, Ja­pan’s Kyodo News said. Ac­cord­ing to Kyodo, the now-de­funct Black Tid­ings had trans­ferred more than US$150,000 to the per­sonal ac­count of Papa Mas­sata and wired US$217,000 to a com­pany run by him by Jan­uary 2014.</p>
    <p>The find­ings, based on fi­nan­cial doc­u­ments and re­port­ing by the In­ter­na­tional Con­sor­tium of In­ves­tiga­tive Jour­nal­ists, in­clud­ing Kyodo, may shed light on al­le­ga­tions that the Tokyo bid com­mit­tee en­gaged in vote-buy­ing, the news agency said.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with Kyodo, Papa Mas­sata de­nied the al­le­ga­tions, say­ing the money he re­ceived was re­lated to a “spon­sor­ship deal made in China. There is noth­ing to do with the Tokyo Olympics”.</p>
    <p>Tsunekazu Takeda, for­mer head of the Tokyo bid com­mit­tee, has also de­nied any wrong­do­ing. Last year, he stepped down as head of Ja­pan’s Olympic Com­mit­tee fol­low­ing the French in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>Last week, Lamine Diack, 87, was found guilty by a French court of cor­rup­tion in cov­er­ing up Rus­sian dop­ing cases and sen­tenced to four years in prison, two of which were sus­pended.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary last year, Black Tid­ings’ owner Ian Tan – said to be a “close busi­ness as­so­ciate” of the younger Diack – was sen­tenced to a week’s jail for giv­ing false in­for­ma­tion to a Cor­rupt Prac­tices In­ves­ti­ga­tion Bureau of­fi­cer who was prob­ing the flow of funds in and out of the com­pany.</p>
