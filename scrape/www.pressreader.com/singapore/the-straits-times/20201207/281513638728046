    <p>To calm her six-year-old son’s first-day-of-school jit­ters, Madam Ber­nice Sum has been fill­ing his mind with pos­i­tive thoughts about what he has to look for­ward to.</p>
    <p>“I tell him that he will get to meet new friends and learn new things. He will get to be in the same school as his sis­ter, and he’ll get a new bag and new sta­tionery, which make him a bit more ex­cited,” she says.</p>
    <p>Ahead of the new school year that be­gins on Jan 4, she has also been eas­ing her son into a rou­tine of sleep­ing about an hour ear­lier ev­ery night, a process that has been go­ing on since Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Madam Sum, 38, who is cur­rently not work­ing and en­rolled in a part-time spe­cialised di­ploma course, also takes her son along to fetch her Pri­mary 2 daugh­ter from Nan Chiau Pri­mary School.</p>
    <p>“My kids have very dif­fer­ent per­son­al­i­ties – my daugh­ter is more chatty and so­cia­ble, but my son is quite shy in a new en­vi­ron­ment,” she says.</p>
    <p>“At first, he would cry when I told him about Pri­mary 1 be­cause he’s afraid he’s go­ing to be alone and have to make friends all over again. It took me a while of talk­ing to him, but now he’s a bit more ready.”</p>
    <p>In about a month’s time, a fresh co­hort of six-year-olds will be start­ing Pri­mary 1.</p>
    <p>Un­like in pre­vi­ous years, there are likely to be re­stric­tions for par­ents hop­ing to catch a glimpse of their chil­dren set­tling in on the first day of school next year.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries, the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) says it is mon­i­tor­ing the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion and will pro­vide details on the ar­range­ments and safe man­age­ment mea­sures for school re­open­ing closer to the date.</p>
    <p>A spokesman says schools are en­cour­aged to con­sider vir­tual al­ter­na­tives to their usual ori­en­ta­tion pro­grammes where pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Some are con­duct­ing ori­en­ta­tion ses­sions in a hy­brid man­ner with both on­line and on-site el­e­ments, which in­clude vis­its i n small groups and at stag­gered time slots.</p>
    <p>The spokesman says some schools will be send­ing ori­en­ta­tion routes to fam­i­lies so they can fa­mil­iarise them­selves and their chil­dren with ar­eas such as the drop-off points, the class­room block, the can­teen and dis­missal points.</p>
    <p>Schools have also been giv­ing par­ents and guardians early ac­cess since Oct 6 to the Par­ents Gate­way app, through which schools send an­nounce­ments or up­dates on pro­grammes and ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Ad­min­is­tra­tive forms can also be com­pleted on­line.</p>
    <p>In the past, par­ents were able to ac­cess the mo­bile app in Novem­ber and re­ceive mes­sages from schools in the mid­dle of December.</p>
    <p>The MOE says uni­forms and books can be bought on­line where pos­si­ble and ap­point­ments can be made with schools for par­ents to com­plete some of these tasks.</p>
    <p>Madam Nooris­mawaty Is­mail, prin­ci­pal of Huamin Pri­mary School, says it had an e-ori­en­ta­tion pro­gramme last month, and a vir­tual tour of the school com­pound, from the main gate to class­rooms, is up on its web­site for par­ents to go through with their chil­dren to men­tally prepare them.</p>
    <p>She notes that par­ents have tra­di­tion­ally been al­lowed to en­ter the school with their Pri­mary 1 chil­dren on the first day and ob­serve them dur­ing re­cess.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, due to the na­tional pos­ture and safe man­age­ment mea­sures that need to be put in place this year, we are pre­pared that this ar­range­ment may not be fea­si­ble,” she says.</p>
    <p>The school has there­fore ar­ranged for its coun­sel­lor and al­lied ed­u­ca­tor (learn­ing and be­havioural sup­port) to be at the main gate, in ad­di­tion to school lead­ers and key per­son­nel, to wel­come pupils and ease any anx­i­ety they may have.</p>
    <p>“We also un­der­stand our par­ents’ needs to be part of this mile­stone jour­ney with their chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“Hence, the school will al­low par­ents and chil­dren to ‘ meet’ vir­tu­ally i n the class­room and dur­ing re­cess on the first day of school,” says Madam Nooris­mawaty, adding that there may be changes de­pend­ing on the na­tional guide­lines.</p>
    <p>Pre-schools have de­signed guides for fam­i­lies to make the move to Pri­mary 1 eas­ier.</p>
    <p>Ms Joanne An­drea Lim, as­sis­tant man­ager of the PAP Com­mu­nity Foun­da­tion’s (PCF) pro­fes­sional and ed­u­ca­tion de­vel­op­ment di­vi­sion, says its kit cov­ers top­ics such as places and peo­ple in a pri­mary school, mak­ing friends and per­sonal hy­giene.</p>
    <p>Ms Thian Ai Ling, gen­eral man­ager of NTUC First Cam­pus’</p>
    <p>My First Skool, says it worked with pri­mary schools to or­gan­ise vir­tual tours for chil­dren and work­shops for par­ents.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren also learn about top­ics re­lated to pri­mary school through “ac­tiv­i­ties, sto­ries and songs to make it more ap­peal­ing and less daunt­ing”, she adds.</p>
    <p>Madam Siti Ka­maliah, 38, whose daugh­ter is start­ing Pri­mary 1 in Can­ton­ment Pri­mary School next year, says: “We’ll be drop­ping her off at the school gate on the first day of school.</p>
    <p>“It’s a bit sad that we’re not able to see her buy her first meal or see where she sits in her class­room, like we did for our older son. But she has some sense of se­cu­rity know­ing her big brother is in the same school.”</p>
    <p>Madam Siti, an ex­ec­u­tive in a ship­broking com­pany, says her daugh­ter is wor­ried about not hav­ing friends in a new school and if teach­ers will be more fierce than in her PCF pre-school.</p>
    <p>“We try to as­sure her that the teach­ers are there to guide her, and her brother also tells her what pri­mary school is like,” she adds.</p>
    <p>The most ex­cit­ing part about Pri­mary 1 for her daugh­ter is putting on a new school uni­form.</p>
    <p>“She has tried on the whole out­fit with her shoes and socks,” says Madam Siti.</p>
    <p>“She wants to show peo­ple that she’s a big girl.”</p>
