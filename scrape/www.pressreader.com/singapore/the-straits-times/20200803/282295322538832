    <p>TOLEDO (Ohio) • The Drive On Cham­pi­onship, the LPGA Tour’s first event in over five months due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, may be lack­ing the usual star names among its field.</p>
    <p>World No. 1 Ko Jin-young and No. 3 Park Sung-hyun are among a num­ber of top in­ter­na­tional golfers who have de­cided to sit out be­cause of Covid-19 con­cerns.</p>
    <p>But that does not mean the ac­tion at the famed In­ver­ness Club is any less thrilling.</p>
    <p>France’s Ce­line Boutier and English­woman Jodi Ewart Shad­off birdied their fi­nal holes on Satur­day to grab a share of the lead with Amer­i­can Danielle Kang.</p>
    <p>Boutier carded a one-un­der 71 while Ewart Shad­off had a 72 for a to­tal of five-un­der 139. Ja­pan’s Yui Kawamoto (71) and Amer­i­can Sarah Sch­melzel (69) shared fourth spot on 141.</p>
    <p>World No. 4 Kang suf­fered a late-round wob­ble, with three con­sec­u­tive bo­geys from the 13th hole to fin­ish one-over on 73 and her clos­est ri­vals feel they can fi­nally get their sea­son off and run­ning.</p>
    <p>Both Boutier and Ewart Shad­off have some­thing to prove, with just two more tour­na­ments be­fore the year’s first Ma­jor, the Aug 20-23 Women’s Bri­tish Open in Scot­land.</p>
    <p>World No. 49 Boutier’s sole LPGA vic­tory came at the Vic­to­rian Open in Fe­bru­ary last year, and she wants to taste more suc­cess af­ter three top-10 fin­ishes in four events on the cir­cuit this year.</p>
    <p>She said: “It kept me mo­ti­vated to prac­tise. The fact I had some­thing to look for­ward to, some kind of com­pe­ti­tion go­ing, was kind of nice.”</p>
    <p>Ewart Shad­off’s drought ex­tends much fur­ther. The world No. 78 has never won on the Tour de­spite over 20 top-10 ca­reer fin­ishes.</p>
