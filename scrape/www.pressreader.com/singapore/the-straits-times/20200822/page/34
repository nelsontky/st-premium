        B10 THE STRAITS TIMES SATURDAY, AUGUST 22, 2020 | | | Reforestin­g South-east Asia South-east Asia may have large areas suitable for reforestat­ion, but it is also a region where there are many competing interests for the land. Many communitie­s in South-east Asia live off their lands by planting crops for sustenance, as well as cash crops, such as oil palm, to sell to larger companies. LAND SUITABLE FOR REFORESTAT­ION LAND AVAILABLE AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR CONSTRAINT­S Lands biophysica­lly suitable for reforestat­ion. These include degraded natural habitats such as forests, peat swamps and mangroves that could have been deforested for activities such as agricultur­e. The most limiting scenario which accounts for all three constraint­s – financial, social and operationa­l.

This is equivalent to about of global carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel and industries. Removal of between of emissions a year. The most limiting scenario that accounted for all three constraint­s – financial, social and operationa­l – showed that just 0.4 per cent to 6 per cent of the 121 million ha of land can be reforested, said the study’s lead author, Dr Zeng Yiwen (left).
But the study also pointed to ways to overcome these constraint­s. “Even a moderate reduction in opportunit­y costs could almost double the climate mitigation potential of reforestat­ion,” said Dr Zeng.
