    <p>I take pub­lic trans­port reg­u­larly, and no­tice that some com­muters do not fol­low the “less talk­ing” rule. Some even pull down their masks to chat, and there are those who pull their masks down to cough or sneeze.</p>
    <p>I sug­gest that posters be dis­played on buses and trains, and an­nounce­ments made in the main lan­guages to re­mind com­muters of the rules. It would also be use­ful to an­nounce that those con­tra­ven­ing the rules will be pun­ished.</p>
    <p>South Buona Vista Road, with its sev­eral hair­pin bends, is a dan­ger zone when ve­hi­cles with more than three axles travel on it. There are cur­rently sev­eral con­struc­tion projects go­ing on near the Pasir Pan­jang Road end. I’ve ob­served sev­eral in­stances of heavy ve­hi­cles us­ing South Buona Vista Road from the di­rec­tion of North Buona Vista Road.</p>
    <p>There was an in­stance of a con­tainer truck that drove down that road, forc­ing on­com­ing traf­fic to stop for it to ma­noeu­vre the bends.</p>
    <p>Th­ese ve­hi­cles pose a dan­ger to other users of the road, as on­com­ing ve­hi­cles are not vis­i­ble un­til they are very near, be­cause of the bends. I hope the Traf­fic Po­lice or Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity will pa­trol the area, given the con­struc­tion works in progress there.</p>
    <p>COM­MUTERS FLOUT MASK RULE</p>

    <p>TRUCK DAN­GER ON WIND­ING ROAD</p>

    <p>I re­fer to the re­port (Salary cri­te­ria for for­eign pro­fes­sion­als to be raised, Aug 28).</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment could con­sider rais­ing the cost of hir­ing Em­ploy­ment Pass and S Pass hold­ers for the com­pany – by im­pos­ing a Jobs Cre­ation levy, in­stead of rais­ing the min­i­mum salaries that have to be paid. This levy would be a source of rev­enue for the Gov­ern­ment and would at the same time send a di­rect mes­sage that it would be com­par­a­tively more costly should any com­pany wish to hire a for­eign pro­fes­sional for the role.</p>
    <p>It would re­mind em­ploy­ers that there are suit­able Sin­ga­pore­ans who can meet their re­quire­ments and would also make it less eco­nom­i­cal to em­ploy a for­eign pro­fes­sional. This would surely make em­ploy­ers think harder about look­ing abroad to hire.</p>
