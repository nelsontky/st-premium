    <p>An out­ing to Sen­tosa is a rare treat for most pre-school­ers, but for the chil­dren at MindChamps PreSchool Sen­tosa, the en­tire is­land is po­ten­tially their class­room.</p>
    <p>The new cen­tre, which opened last month, is lo­cated at Hard Rock Ho­tel within the Re­sorts World Sen­tosa (RWS) com­plex and aims to make full use of its unique ad­van­tages.</p>
    <p>It is work­ing with the Ed­u­ca­tion, Re­search & Con­ser­va­tion (ERC) team at RWS’ S.E.A. Aquar­ium to cu­rate pro­grammes tai­lored to the learn­ing needs of its stu­dents. While RWS al­ready of­fers sev­eral types of learn­ing jour­neys to all pre-schools, the one for MindChamps Sen­tosa will be a cu­rated in­quiry- and project-based pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>It may in­volve one or two class­room lessons, fol­lowed by projects cen­tred around the chil­dren’s in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, if most of them want to learn about sharks, the ERC team will work with MindChamps Sen­tosa’s teach­ers to de­velop projects for the chil­dren to raise aware­ness of the plight of sharks or or­gan­ise a beach cleanup to pro­tect the an­i­mals’ habi­tat.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents may also be able to in­ter­view an aquar­ist, who cares for ma­rine life at the aquar­ium, or a staff mem­ber from the ERC team may bring arte­facts about sharks to the pre-school.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme is slated to be­gin some time next year, pend­ing ap­proval from the rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties, as all ed­u­ca­tional tours are sus­pended dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Span­ning 13,000 sq ft with in­door and out­door learn­ing zones, the cen­tre fol­lows MindChamps’ 3-Mind curriculum that teaches kids to have the mind­set of a cham­pion, a learner and a cre­ative in­di­vid­ual.</p>
    <p>Un­like the case at its other branches, how­ever, stu­dents here will have reg­u­lar ac­cess to the Hard Rock Ho­tel’s sand pit, while their par­ents will re­ceive a free RWS In­vites gold mem­ber­ship with cred­its worth $488, as well as a Sen­tosa Is­lan­der Pass. Fees for full-day child care start from $1,965 a month.</p>
    <p>The Sen­tosa pre-school, MindChamps’ 40th to date, will “lever­age the en­tire is­land and its many at­trac­tions as an ex­ten­sion of our learn­ing class­room”, says Ms Michelle Peh, chief brand of­fi­cer and global group gen­eral man­ager of MindChamps PreSchool.</p>
    <p>“Our teach­ers are able to cre­atively re­in­force class­room learn­ing with ac­tual ex­pe­ri­en­tial learn­ing. These ex­pe­ri­ences en­gage our stu­dents and in­stil a nat­u­ral cu­rios­ity that fur­ther de­vel­ops their life­long pas­sion for l earn­ing,” she adds.</p>
