    <p>More peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore across dif­fer­ent age groups have been seek­ing help for men­tal health is­sues amid the Covid-19 out­break. Some ex­perts said that while the in­crease may be in part due to Covid-19 tak­ing its toll, it could also point to greater aware­ness of men­tal health is­sues and re­duced stigma in seek­ing pro­fes­sional help.</p>
    <p>More peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore have been seek­ing help for men­tal health is­sues amid the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>Ahead of World Men­tal Health Day to­day, The Straits Times spoke to more than a dozen men­tal health clin­i­cians and ser­vice providers from the pub­lic, pri­vate and com­mu­nity sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Most of them said there has been a sig­nif­i­cant rise in the num­ber of help-seek­ers across dif­fer­ent age groups.</p>
    <p>BOTH OLD AND YOUNG AF­FECTED</p>
    <p>Mr Asher Low, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of Lim­it­less, a non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion that deals with youth men­tal health, said the or­gan­i­sa­tion has seen over 250 new clients seek­ing help so far this year – 13 more than the num­ber of new clients for the whole of last year.</p>
    <p>“Quite a num­ber of our ex­ist­ing clients de­te­ri­o­rated be­cause they lost ac­cess to cop­ing ac­tiv­i­ties and so­cial sup­port, or were stuck at home in an un­con­ducive en­vi­ron­ment, such as (one with) poor fam­ily re­la­tion­ships or abu­sive par­ents,” he said.</p>
    <p>But it is not just the young whose men­tal well-be­ing has suf­fered due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>O’Joy, a vol­un­tary wel­fare or­gan­i­sa­tion look­ing af­ter the men­tal health of se­niors, saw a 26 per cent in­crease in the num­ber of clients in Au­gust and last month com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>O’Joy clin­i­cal di­rec­tor Teo Puay Leng said se­niors who are still work­ing may be anx­ious about los­ing their jobs and be­ing un­able to find an­other one in the cur­rent eco­nomic cli­mate, while oth­ers are af­fected by their loved ones get­ting re­trenched.</p>
    <p>Those who are used to tak­ing part in out­door ac­tiv­i­ties have also be­come anx­ious as they have had to stay home on their own, she said.</p>
    <p>MORE CALLS TO SUI­CIDE HELPLINE</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Sa­mar­i­tans of Sin­ga­pore – which fo­cuses on sui­cide preven­tion – re­ceived 26,460 calls for help from Jan­uary to Au­gust this year, up from 21,429 in the same pe­riod the year be­fore.</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive Gasper Tan said call­ers sought help for is­sues aris­ing from the eco­nomic im­pact of Covid-19, stress from hav­ing to adapt to telecom­mut­ing and home­based learning, and so­cial re­la­tion­ships af­fected by the virus sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>OB­STA­CLES TO SEEK­ING HELP</p>
    <p>While the num­ber of help-seek­ers for men­tal health is­sues was up at pub­lic hos­pi­tals such as Alexan­dra Hos­pi­tal and Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal, poly­clin­ics un­der SingHealth Poly­clin­ics (SHP) and Na­tional Univer­sity Poly­clin­ics (NUP) saw no sig­nif­i­cant in­crease in help-seek­ers.</p>
    <p>The clin­i­cal lead for SHP’s Men­tal Health Work­group, Dr David Koot, noted that there was an over­all drop in pa­tient at­ten­dance at SHP dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, pos­si­bly due to the fear of con­tract­ing Covid-19 at a poly­clinic.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, Dr Ben­jamin Cheah, a fam­ily physi­cian at NUP’s Jurong Poly­clinic, said that safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures could have led to peo­ple</p>
    <p>seek­ing help from helplines such as the Na­tional Care Hot­line in­stead.</p>
    <p>He added that NUP’s psy­chol­o­gists con­ducted tele­con­sul­ta­tions, when­ever pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Tele­con­sul­ta­tion was also in­tro­duced by the Na­tional Health­care Group Poly­clin­ics, which saw a 10 per cent in­crease in pa­tients seek­ing treat­ment for men­tal health con­di­tions in the first half of this year.</p>
    <p>Dr Wong Mei Yin, prin­ci­pal psy­chol­o­gist at Ang Mo Kio Poly­clinic, said that this al­lowed pa­tients to bet­ter man­age their con­di­tions “from the safety and con­ve­nience of their homes”.</p>
    <p>While this may be true for some, Ms Lee Yi Ping, senior case man­ager and team leader at the In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health’s (IMH) Com­mu­nity Health As­sess­ment Team, pointed out that for oth­ers, home is not a safe space.</p>
    <p>She ad­vised those caught in such a sit­u­a­tion to step out of their house for a short while to con­tact their ser­vice provider and work out a suit­able ar­range­ment.</p>
    <p>OLD CON­DI­TIONS WORSEN, NEW ONES EMERGE</p>
    <p>Dr Geral­dine Tan, di­rec­tor and prin­ci­pal psy­chol­o­gist at The Ther­apy Room, saw a 15 per cent in­crease in clients this year. She noted that the pan­demic had not only caused men­tal health is­sues in peo­ple who pre­vi­ously had none, but also ex­ac­er­bated pre-ex­ist­ing con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>A sim­i­lar mix of old and new help-seek­ers was ob­served by Dr Mar­cus Tan, con­sul­tant psy­chi­a­trist at Health­way Med­i­cal’s Nobel Psy­cho­log­i­cal Well­ness Cen­tre. He saw a 25 per cent to 30 per cent in­crease in pa­tients.</p>
    <p>A SILVER LIN­ING</p>
    <p>But it is not all doom and gloom.</p>
    <p>Ms Joy Hou, prin­ci­pal psy­chol­o­gist at Em­pa­thyWorks Psy­cho­log­i­cal Well­ness, who saw an al­most 20 per cent in­crease in clients, said that while the in­crease may be in part due to Covid-19 tak­ing its toll, it could also point to greater aware­ness of men­tal health is­sues and re­duced stigma in seek­ing pro­fes­sional help.</p>
    <p>IMH senior con­sul­tant Jimmy Lee echoed the sen­ti­ment by say­ing that the in­crease in help-seek­ing be­hav­iour dur­ing this pe­riod is “a good thing”.</p>
    <p>Dr Lee said that the cri­sis has re­sulted in var­i­ous men­tal health or­gan­i­sa­tions com­ing up with new ini­tia­tives such as vir­tual sem­i­nars, new helplines be­ing set up, and peo­ple learning to iden­tify and help those in dis­tress.</p>
    <p>“I think this is a good op­por­tu­nity... Peo­ple are con­cerned about the men­tal health needs of var­i­ous as­pects of the pop­u­la­tion,” he said.</p>
