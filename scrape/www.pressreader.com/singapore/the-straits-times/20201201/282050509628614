    <p>To fight the Covid-19 pan­demic, the Gov­ern­ment has ded­i­cated al­most $100 bil­lion across four Bud­gets this year.</p>
    <p>While there were mea­sures in the first Unity Bud­get in Fe­bru­ary to help fam­i­lies with the long­stand­ing is­sue of cost of liv­ing, as the pan­demic pro­gressed, it be­came clear that more had to be done to keep Sin­ga­pore­ans’ and busi­nesses’ heads above wa­ter, said Per­ma­nent Sec­re­tary for Fi­nance Tan Ching Yee.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan, 56, told The Straits Times last Fri­day: “By the time we came to the Re­silience Bud­get (in March), we had to triple the pay­out just to flow the emer­gency help.”</p>
    <p>At the same time, the Gov­ern­ment was de­lib­er­at­ing the worstcase sce­nario of shut­ting down schools and busi­nesses com­pletely.</p>
    <p>“By the time we an­nounced the Re­silience Bud­get, the de­ci­sion was ac­tu­ally get­ting close to ‘we may need a cir­cuit breaker’. The im­pact on busi­nesses and work­ers would be se­vere.”</p>
    <p>The team at the Min­istry of Fi­nance (MOF) worked round the clock with the Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund Board to bring for­ward a Sol­i­dar­ity Pay­ment of $600 for all adult Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>The team also worked closely with the Board and In­land Rev­enue Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore to pay out the Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS) of wage sub­si­dies more quickly.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing the Re­silience Bud­get, we were still think­ing we could pay this out in end-May, which was al­ready brought for­ward from the end-July timeline in the Unity Bud­get. But (May) was so far away,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Luck­ily, with rig­or­ous re­view of the pro­cesses, we were able to bring for­ward the JSS pay­out to April by the time DPM Heng (Swee Keat) an­nounced the Sol­i­dar­ity Bud­get.”</p>
    <p>Wage sup­port was also bumped up to 75 per cent, from a min­i­mum of 25 per cent.</p>
    <p>But she said MOF was not given a blank cheque to loosen the pub­lic purse. It had to seek ap­proval from the Gov­ern­ment and Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob to draw on past re­serves – up to $52 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan added: “We can­not take for granted that any re­quest would be con­curred to by the Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>“Both the Pres­i­dent and the</p>
    <p>Coun­cil of Pres­i­den­tial Ad­vis­ers had to lis­ten to our rea­sons, and sat­isfy them­selves that the re­quest met the re­quire­ment of ex­cep­tional cir­cum­stances un­der which past re­serves can be drawn.”</p>
    <p>Ms Tan, who has spent 34 years in the pub­lic ser­vice, said while the Gov­ern­ment had pre­pared it­self for some form of cri­sis, Covid-19 was not a sit­u­a­tion for which there had been a “full-dress re­hearsal”: “There were many sur­prises... that re­quired us to re­fine our poli­cies and strate­gies as we went along.”</p>
    <p>The for­mer per­ma­nent sec­re­tary for ed­u­ca­tion was es­pe­cially touched by how teach­ers ral­lied to help their stu­dents.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 brought home very clearly the pos­i­tive im­pact our so­cial in­vest­ments have had on in­equal­ity. The cir­cuit breaker showed us how much our schools have helped to pre­vent the bot­tom from fall­ing out – many chil­dren were able to go to the se­cu­rity of the schools and have a good en­vi­ron­ment in which to learn.”</p>
    <p>Over 4,000 stu­dents whose par­ents work in es­sen­tial ser­vices and did not have al­ter­na­tive care con­tin­ued to turn up at school dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker. The Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion also pro­vided school meal sub­si­dies.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Tan: “We should give credit to all the un­sung heroes, both in schools and com­mu­nity or­gan­i­sa­tions, for their care and for hold­ing things up.”</p>
