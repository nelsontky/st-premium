    <p>1 STEP FOR­WARD, 2 STEPS BACK</p>
    <p>Manch­ester United man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer blasted “un­for­giv­able” de­fend­ing from his hap­less side as they slumped to a 2-1 Cham­pi­ons League de­feat by debu­tants Is­tan­bul Basak­se­hir on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>United, floun­der­ing i n 15th place i n the Pre­mier League, started the game as firm favourites af­ter an im­pres­sive 2-1 win against last sea­son’s fi­nal­ists Paris Saint-Ger­main and a 5-0 thrash­ing of RB Leipzig.</p>
    <p>But de­feat in Turkey – a first Cham­pi­ons League group-stage win for Basak­se­hir – heaps the pres­sure on Sol­sk­jaer, whose side looked short of in­spi­ra­tion and ba­sic de­fen­sive nous in Is­tan­bul.</p>
    <p>They were badly ex­posed on the break as former Chelsea for­ward Demba Ba and Edin Visca gave the home team a two-goal cush­ion.</p>
    <p>United gave them­selves hope when they re­duced the deficit shortly be­fore half-time through an An­thony Mar­tial header.</p>
    <p>But de­spite mul­ti­ple sec­ond­half changes and an ar­ray of at­tack­ing tal­ent, Sol­sk­jaer’s lack­lus­tre team could not find a way past the or­gan­ised Basak­se­hir de­fence.</p>
    <p>The re­sult ended United’s long­est away win­ning run in all com­pe­ti­tions in their his­tory – 10 straight vic­to­ries – and was their first de­feat on the road in 19 matches since los­ing in Jan­uary at Liver­pool in the league.</p>
    <p>Sol­sk­jaer ad­mit­ted the vis­i­tors’ dis­play was not good enough.</p>
    <p>“They scored two goals like you do in Europe when you do not de­fend well enough,” he told BT Sport. “The first one is that we play a short cor­ner and for­get about the man up top. That is un­for­giv­able. The sec­ond one as well, we are not very well or­gan­ised to counter the press.</p>
    <p>“You don’t turn up and get three points in the Cham­pi­ons League. They are a team well or­gan­ised and we were not good enough. That is it.”</p>
    <p>The home side went ahead in the 12th minute af­ter in­ex­pli­ca­bly poor aware­ness and or­gan­i­sa­tion al­lowed an un­marked Ba to col­lect a long ball and race from the half­way line to score.</p>
    <p>The Red Devils were caught nap­ping again five min­utes be­fore half-time af­ter Deniz Tu­ruc robbed Juan Mata of pos­ses­sion be­fore send­ing over a cross that Ba dum­mied for Visca to smash past Dean Hen­der­son, who was mak­ing his Cham­pi­ons League de­but in place of David de Gea.</p>
    <p>United got one back when Mar­tial headed a Luke Shaw cross home. But while Sol­sk­jaer sought to pep up his at­tack by hook­ing off Axel Tuanzebe at the in­ter­val and throw­ing on Scott McTom­i­nay, Edin­son Ca­vani and Paul Pogba, they could not res­cue a point in the Group H tie.</p>
    <p>His side have now suf­fered con­sec­u­tive de­feats by Arsenal and Basak­se­hir and he called on his play­ers to stand up and be counted ahead of their Pre­mier League trip to Ever­ton to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>“They (two losses) have set us back a lot,” he said. “You get a re­al­ity check ev­ery time you play a game of foot­ball.</p>
    <p>“It’s not easy to be pos­i­tive now. Of course it isn’t, when you’ve just lost the way we did. But these play­ers are good play­ers and we have a chance on Satur­day morn­ing to get go­ing again.”</p>
    <p>He also played down the sack ru­mours, in­sist­ing “it’s early on” and he would “stay strong”, but pun­dit Jason Cundy be­lieves his fu­ture may hinge on a pos­i­tive re­sult at Good­i­son Park.</p>
    <p>The former Chelsea de­fender told talkSport: “This is mas­sive for</p>
    <p>Ole, I think if they were to lose against them, then that in­ter­na­tional break... that can be a grave­yard for some man­agers.”</p>
    <p>So­cial me­dia has also been rife with spec­u­la­tion over a re­place­ment, with Mauri­cio Po­chet­tino once again be­ing heav­ily linked with the role.</p>
    <p>The former Tot­ten­ham boss has been with­out a job since be­ing fired by the north Lon­don side last Novem­ber, but he told Sky Sports ear­lier this week he was ready to re­turn to the dugout.</p>
    <p>“I al­ways feel ready to be again in­volved in the game,” he said on Mon­day. I am look­ing for­ward to be­ing in­volved in the game. You miss that, that’s the re­al­ity.”</p>
    <p>They (two losses) have set us back a lot. You get a re­al­ity check ev­ery time you play a game of foot­ball.</p>

    <p>JOB AT RISK</p>
    <p>This is mas­sive for Ole, I think if they were to lose against (Ever­ton), then that in­ter­na­tional break... that can be a grave­yard for some man­agers.</p>
