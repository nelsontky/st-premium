    <p>WELLING­TON New Zealand an­nounced yes­ter­day that it was shut­ting down its largest city, Auck­land, af­ter four new cases of Covid-19 were dis­cov­ered there, the first ev­i­dence of do­mes­tic trans­mis­sion af­ter be­ing coro­n­avirus-free for 102 days.</p>
    <p>New Zealand’s suc­cess­ful fight against Covid-19 was hailed glob­ally and the Pa­cific is­land na­tion of five mil­lion was seen as one of the safest places, as the pan­demic raged world­wide.</p>
    <p>Di­rec­tor-Gen­eral of Health Ashley Bloom­field said the four cases were within one fam­ily in South Auck­land. One per­son is in the 50s age group, and they had no his­tory of in­ter­na­tional travel. Fam­ily mem­bers have been tested and con­tact trac­ing is un­der way.</p>
    <p>Mr Bloom­field said the un­known na­ture of the new cases meant it was likely there would be more pos­i­tive cases in the com­ing days.</p>
    <p>News of the cases sparked panic across the coun­try, with me­dia re­ports on peo­ple rush­ing to su­per­mar­kets to stock up on sup­plies, and busi­nesses pre­par­ing to shut.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern said Auck­land would move to the</p>
    <p>Level 3 re­stric­tion from noon to­day as a “pre­cau­tion­ary ap­proach”, mean­ing peo­ple should stay away from work and school, and gath­er­ings of more than 10 peo­ple would again be re­stricted. New Zealand has a four-level alert sys­tem.</p>
    <p>The re­stric­tion would be ap­plied for three days un­til Fri­day, which she said would al­low enough time to as­sess the sit­u­a­tion, gather in­for­ma­tion and make sure there was wide­spread con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>She added that travel into Auck­land, on the North Is­land, would be re­stricted un­less one lives there.</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern also said the rest of New Zealand would en­ter alert Level 2 from mid­day to­day for three days. This would mean so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures would be ap­plied again and mass gath­er­ings would be lim­ited to 100 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“This is some­thing we have pre­pared for,” she said in a news con­fer­ence. “We have had a 102 days (record) and it was easy to feel New Zealand was out of the woods. No coun­try has gone as far as we did with­out hav­ing a resur­gence. And be­cause we were the only ones, we had to plan.”</p>
    <p>New Zealand is set to vote in a national elec­tion on Sept 19, in which Ms Ardern is ex­pected to win com­fort­ably, ac­cord­ing to opinion polls, on the back of her han­dling of the out­break.</p>
    <p>But the re­turn of the virus could back­fire on the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern said she has not given any con­sid­er­a­tion to the im­pact of the new re­stric­tions on the polls at this stage, and cam­paign­ing over the next few days would not take place in Auck­land.</p>
    <p>The main op­po­si­tion National Party leader Ju­dith Collins said: “This will come as a shock to all New Zealan­ders... (We) will be seek­ing an ex­pla­na­tion and clear an­swers about the sit­u­a­tion we now find our­selves in.”</p>
    <p>Auck­land Mayor Phil Goff said: “I am urg­ing Auck­lan­ders to come to­gether like we did last time to stamp out com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion. Please re­main calm, please do not panic buy and please fol­low the lock­down rules.”</p>
    <p>New Zealand was placed un­der a tight lock­down for weeks af­ter it re­ported its first known case on Feb 26, and the last case of com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion was de­tected on May 1.</p>
