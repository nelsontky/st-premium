    <p>WHAT IS UL­CER­A­TIVE COL­I­TIS?</p>
    <p>It is an in­flam­ma­tory bowel dis­ease that causes long-last­ing in­flam­ma­tion and ul­cers (sores) in the di­ges­tive tract, ac­cord­ing to the Mayo Clinic. Ul­cer­a­tive col­i­tis af­fects the in­ner­most lin­ing of the large in­tes­tine (colon) and rec­tum.</p>
    <p>WHAT ARE THE CAUSES?</p>
    <p>The ex­act cause of ul­cer­a­tive col­i­tis re­mains un­known but ex­perts be­lieved that ab­nor­mal im­mune re­sponse, ge­net­ics, mi­cro­biome and en­vi­ron­men­tal fac­tors could con­trib­ute to the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>The Crohn’s and Col­i­tis Foun­da­tion said re­search sug­gests that ul­cer­a­tive col­i­tis could be trig­gered by an in­ter­ac­tion be­tween a virus or bac­te­rial in­fec­tion in the colon and the body’s im­mune re­sponse.</p>
    <p>The Mayo Clinic said hered­ity could play a role in that ul­cer­a­tive col­i­tis is more com­mon in peo­ple who have fam­ily mem­bers with the dis­ease. How­ever, it also noted that most peo­ple with ul­cer­a­tive col­i­tis do not have this fam­ily history.</p>
    <p>WHAT ARE THE SYMP­TOMS?</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Bri­tain’s Na­tional Health Ser­vice (NHS), some peo­ple may go for weeks or months with very mild symp­toms, or none at all, fol­lowed by pe­ri­ods where there are se­vere symp­toms. It may in­clude di­ar­rhoea, of­ten with blood or pus, ab­dom­i­nal pain and cramp­ing, rec­tal pain or bleed­ing and ur­gency or in­abil­ity to defe­cate. It could also lead to weight loss, fa­tigue, fever, loss of ap­petite and nau­sea.</p>
    <p>WHO’S AF­FECTED?</p>
    <p>It is more com­mon in white peo­ple of Euro­pean de­scent, es­pe­cially those de­scended from Ashke­nazi Jewish com­mu­ni­ties, and black peo­ple, said the NHS. The con­di­tion is rarer in peo­ple from Asian back­grounds, al­though the rea­sons for this are un­clear. Both men and women seem to be equally af­fected by ul­cer­a­tive col­i­tis.</p>
    <p>WHAT ARE THE TREAT­MENT OP­TIONS?</p>
    <p>Treat­ment for ul­cer­a­tive col­i­tis is mul­ti­fac­eted and in­cludes the use of med­i­ca­tion, al­ter­ations in diet and nu­tri­tion, and some­times sur­gi­cal pro­ce­dures to re­pair or re­move af­fected por­tions of the gas­troin­testi­nal tract.</p>
