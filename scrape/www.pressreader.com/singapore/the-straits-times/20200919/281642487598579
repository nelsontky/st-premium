    <p>The use of saliva test­ing to de­tect Covid-19 is un­der­go­ing field tests in Sin­ga­pore, as the health au­thor­i­ties as­sess if it can be scaled for wide­spread use.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to queries from The Straits Times, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said on Thurs­day that it is as­sess­ing fac­tors such as con­sis­tency and in­tegrity of sam­ple col­lec­tion, ef­fi­ciency of lab­o­ra­tory pro­cesses and the abil­ity to cater for high vol­umes of tests via pooled test­ing.</p>
    <p>It added that most sam­ples for Covid-19 test­ing are col­lected through na­sopha­ryn­geal (back of the nose) or oropha­ryn­geal (back of the throat) swabs, which can be pooled, thus al­low­ing for high vol­umes of tests to be ef­fi­ciently pro­cessed daily. Pooled tests in­volve us­ing one Covid-19 test on a group of sus­pect cases, and if it yields a pos­i­tive re­sult, all in­di­vid­u­als who were part of the group will be in­di­vid­u­ally tested to de­ter­mine the Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>The MOH added that its pre­lim­i­nary find­ings showed saliva test­ing may be “slightly more com­fort­able for some in­di­vid­u­als”, though mech­a­nisms to scale up test­ing in lab­o­ra­to­ries, in­clud­ing pooled test­ing, are still be­ing devel­oped.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries on why Sin­ga­pore has taken longer in com­par­i­son with other coun­tries to trial saliva test­ing, Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher, a se­nior in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal, said: “The lack of con­sis­tency in test col­lec­tion meth­ods may mean that it is dif­fi­cult to stan­dard­ise the col­lec­tion process, in ad­di­tion to the ex­tra steps needed to process the tests in the lab, which could af­fect the labs’ test­ing ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore the tests can be scaled up, it is im­por­tant for us to con­firm that the saliva is sen­si­tive enough as a sam­ple, and that the labs can man­age this very dif­fer­ent spec­i­men. Even then, I am not sure if any coun­try does this as its main­stay of col­lect­ing spec­i­mens, but there would cer­tainly not be many.”</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ray­mond Lin, direc­tor of the Na­tional Public Health Lab­o­ra­tory at the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases (NCID), said the cen­tre is aware of three lo­cal stud­ies done on saliva test­ing, all of which ar­rived at dif­fer­ent con­clu­sions, in­clud­ing an ear­lier study con­ducted by the cen­tre.</p>
    <p>“To val­i­date var­i­ous sam­pling meth­ods, NCID is un­der­tak­ing fur­ther study and anal­y­sis us­ing a struc­tured stan­dard­ised test­ing ap­proach with the ap­proval from MOH,” he said.</p>
    <p>In a study led by As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Hsu Li Yang, pro­gramme leader of in­fec­tious dis­eases and co-direc­tor of global health at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, it was shown that saliva test­ing through se­cre­tions taken from the back of the throat can be a vi­able method for Covid-19 test­ing.</p>
    <p>The study, which has not been peer re­viewed, took place from June 2 to June 26, and was con­ducted among 200 mi­grant work­ers who were re­cruited from com­mu­nity care fa­cil­i­ties and dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>They con­sisted of both con­firmed and sus­pected cases, in­clud­ing those who were asymp­to­matic close con­tacts of con­firmed cases, as well as pa­tients who had symp­toms of acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Three tests were done on the pa­tients con­cur­rently – na­sopha­ryn­geal swabs, saliva tests and self-ad­min­is­tered nasal swabs – to com­pare their ef­fi­cacy.</p>
    <p>Of the three, the saliva test re­flected the high­est per­cent­age of pos­i­tive re­sults, sug­gest­ing that it may be more sen­si­tive than na­sopha­ryn­geal swabs, whereas self-ad­min­is­tered nasal swabs were the least sen­si­tive. As the swabs were self-ad­min­is­tered, it is likely that they reached only the front part of the nasal pas­sage, which has a lower vi­ral load, there­fore yield­ing poor re­sults.</p>
    <p>When asked about the pos­si­bil­ity of false pos­i­tives in the test re­sults, Prof Hsu noted that false pos­i­tives and neg­a­tives can­not be dis­counted en­tirely, as they oc­cur in rou­tine test­ing, but the chances of this oc­cur­ring and the im­pact are very low.</p>
    <p>The MOH added that its pre­lim­i­nary find­ings showed saliva test­ing may be “slightly more com­fort­able for some in­di­vid­u­als”, though mech­a­nisms to scale up test­ing in lab­o­ra­to­ries, in­clud­ing pooled test­ing, are still be­ing devel­oped.</p>
