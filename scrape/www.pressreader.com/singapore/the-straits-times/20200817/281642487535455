    <p>Mr Andy Yap, 40, used to de­sign graph­ics for an events com­pany, but after be­ing laid off in Fe­bru­ary, he now spends six days a week zip­ping around Yishun de­liv­er­ing food on his moun­tain bike.</p>
    <p>As one of the ca­su­al­ties in the com­pany’s re­trench­ment ex­er­cise, the for­mer dig­i­tal de­sign di­rec­tor now earns up to $2,000 “in a good month”, which is about one-quar­ter of the salary he used to draw.</p>
    <p>When projects dried up for the com­pany early this year, Mr Yap, who worked at the firm for about two years, was laid off, along with at least two oth­ers.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t re­ally re­act when I was told I was be­ing let go. I was quite calm and went to pack up. It only sunk in the next few days,” he said.</p>
    <p>In the weeks after, he tried ap­ply­ing for jobs in all sec­tors, in­clud­ing su­per­mar­kets, hos­pi­tals and clean­ing com­pa­nies, but the ap­pli­ca­tions were ei­ther un­suc­cess­ful or he did not hear back from them.</p>
    <p>“There were mo­ments when I felt this sense of dread, and I started to re­alise just how badly im­pacted the global econ­omy was and how jobs were af­fected,” said Mr Yap, who is mar­ried with no chil­dren. His wife works as a soft­ware spe­cial­ist.</p>
    <p>He also feels that his age could pose an is­sue for some em­ploy­ers, and he has been told by re­cruiters that he did not make the cut be­cause he is over-ex­pe­ri­enced.</p>
    <p>Since April, he has been mak­ing food de­liv­er­ies on his bi­cy­cle. The one sil­ver lin­ing from this is that he has lost more than 10kg from cy­cling 12 hours a day.</p>
    <p>“Food de­liv­ery is pan­demic- and re­ces­sion-re­sis­tant. Ev­ery­one still needs to eat, so I de­cided to do this,” said Mr Yap, who has cut back on his non-es­sen­tial spend­ing, such as eat­ing out.</p>
    <p>Some peo­ple have ques­tioned his de­ci­sion to be­come a food de­liv­ery rider after his pre­vi­ous post in a di­rec­tor role, but Mr Yap thinks noth­ing of it.</p>
    <p>“For me, a job is a job. You put your head down and bring some money home,” he said.</p>
    <p>His ad­vice for oth­ers go­ing through tough times is to be pos­i­tive. “There is a light at the end of the tun­nel, just that now the tun­nel has got a lot longer. But you have to keep go­ing.”</p>
