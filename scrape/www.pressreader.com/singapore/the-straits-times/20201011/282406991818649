        - <span role="byline">Low Kar Tiang&#xD;&#xA;Low Kar Tiang is a re&#xAD;tired Sin&#xAD;ga&#xAD;porean teacher, aged 64, who left for Bri&#xAD;tain in March for a hol&#xAD;i&#xAD;day and made it back here only on Sept 11, af&#xAD;ter en&#xAD;dur&#xAD;ing flight can&#xAD;cel&#xAD;la&#xAD;tions, lock&#xAD;downs and ever-chang&#xAD;ing travel ad&#xAD;vi&#xAD;sories.</span>

    <p>There were only 10 pas­sen­gers on the flight from Lon­don to</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore on Sept 10, out of a ca­pac­ity of 336.</p>
    <p>I ar­rived at Changi Air­port the next day and was shep­herded towards an im­mi­gra­tion area that was un­recog­nis­able, the con­course filled with im­mi­gra­tion of­fi­cers in­stead of pas­sen­gers, with too lit­tle to do.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing been pro­cessed, I was given a yel­low sticker as signs and bar­ri­ers guided me towards a coach. Ev­ery­one was im­mensely help­ful, of­fer­ing to carry my lug­gage, but no­body would say any­thing when I asked where we were go­ing.</p>
    <p>Even the driver kept sch­tum. I took a good look at my fel­low pas­sen­gers – mostly maids and work per­mit hold­ers.</p>
    <p>I had ex­pected the govern­ment-des­ig­nated ho­tels to be near the air­port. Once we were com­fort­ably past East Coast, I started day­dream­ing how won­der­ful it would be if it was the Shangri-La Ho­tel at Orange Grove Road.</p>
    <p>Few Sin­ga­pore ho­tels have bal­conies and Shangri-La is one of them. If we were not al­lowed out of our rooms, a bal­cony could make the dif­fer­ence for me be­tween claus­tro­pho­bia and san­ity.</p>
    <p>When the coach en­tered Tan­jong Pa­gar, I be­gan to feel ex­cite­ment. Where were we go­ing? Af­ter Telok Blan­gah, signs for Sen­tosa ap­peared. The coach headed towards Shangri-La’s Rasa Sen­tosa Re­sort & Spa. I rubbed my jet-lagged eyes to make sure it wasn’t a dream. Never had I been on a jour­ney of such won­der, hope and re­lief.</p>
    <p>I asked nicely if I could have a room with a sea view. The ef­fi­cient young re­cep­tion­ist said that the sea-view rooms had been moth­balled; we would all be put in stan­dard rooms and were to be grate­ful for that (those were not her words, but my im­pres­sion).</p>
    <p>My stan­dard room was gi­nor­mous, with a bal­cony, a view of the for­est and, if I craned my neck, the sea. I was over­joyed. I could live here.</p>
    <p>I spoke too soon. The food, if you could call what was left out­side your room three times a day, food. I have never in all my life eaten such aw­ful, un­recog­nis­able gloop, what ap­peared to be meat coated in a chewy rub­bery sub­stance. The rice was brit­tle, veg­eta­bles al­ter­nated be­tween bak choy and broc­coli, both of which I dis­like. How wrong can you get with break­fast? Eggs are in­her­ently tasty and don’t need med­dling with. I took a bite of a yel­low block that passed as scram­bled eggs and spat it out. It was floury. It tasted of des­per­a­tion.</p>
    <p>At the time, I wondered how a five-star ho­tel could have such a lousy kitchen. I be­gan to plot to go on a food strike to lose weight. Then a friend told me it was catered fare which­ever ho­tel you were sent to.</p>
    <p>I stud­ied the ho­tel menu. Five times the price of my hawker favourites. Even at 30 per cent off for quar­an­tine guests, it seemed ex­ces­sive: char kway teow, $25; sa­tay, $22; Asian break­fast, $32.</p>
    <p>I gin­gerly or­dered sa­tay – the best I ever tasted in my life. Meat, not only ten­der but also juicy, the por­tion gen­er­ous and, with the dis­count, ex­cel­lent value for money.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery other lo­cal dish was fab­u­lous and I must give the chef credit for an out-of-this-world nasi lemak. The rice was amazing, fra­grant and fluffy and so mor­eish, it could have been a dish in it­self. This ex­pe­ri­ence I re­peated sev­eral times and vowed to come back for, upon re­lease.</p>
    <p>Once the food is­sue was solved, time flew. I had no long­ing to face the masked world, to talk through a bar­rier, to won­der if the wear­ers were frown­ing or smil­ing. I made sure I spoke to friends or fam­ily at least once a day, to air the vo­cal cords.</p>
    <p>There was no pin­ing about “when I am out, I’m go­ing to do this and that”. I had de­cided to use the time fruit­fully, to im­prove my­self in two ma­jor ways: lose weight and ex­er­cise mind and body. Los­ing weight went out of the win­dow the mo­ment I tasted that heav­enly sa­tay and nasi lemak.</p>
    <p>I de­cided to learn taiji.</p>
    <p>I found an ex­cel­lent web­site and spent three hours a day strug­gling with the move­ments.</p>
    <p>It is hard to learn phys­i­cal move­ment on­line. The teacher’s left is my right and vice versa. Thank­fully, I got hooked about the time I was about to give up. The day I learnt all 24 steps, I or­dered a glass of sparkling wine to cel­e­brate. I surely would have given it up in the free world of other dis­trac­tions.</p>
    <p>I fin­ished read­ing the three books I had, cover to cover, a sat­is­fy­ing feel­ing of com­ple­tion, where once I had a ten­dency to browse.</p>
    <p>I learnt po­ems by heart. I brushed up on Chi­nese; a Bei­jing professor and I ex­changed Chi­nese and English lessons via the mag­i­cal medium of Skype.</p>
    <p>There was tele­vi­sion, a lux­ury as I have never owned one, which makes it a treat when I am on hol­i­day, or quar­an­tine. I watched the news twice a day to ac­com­pany lunch and din­ner, but frankly there was no time for movies.</p>
    <p>It was lush out­side my room, dead quiet, no man-made noises, just the sweet song of birds and the col­lec­tive rasps and per­cus­sive mu­sic of in­sects. If I made this sound like par­adise, it was.</p>
    <p>There was a tiny laun­dry al­lowance which cov­ers one item a day if you don’t want to pay any ex­cess. My T-shirts came back smelling of cheap-smelling soft­ener, which took about 10 soaks in the posh hand soap pro­vided by the ho­tel to re­move. That took up a lot of my time and hence­forth I did my own laun­dry and dried it on the bal­cony.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the 15 days, Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Au­thor­ity of­fi­cials spot-checked in per­son three times, video-called twice and voice-called once. The ho­tel called daily for my body tem­per­a­ture. They did their jobs pro­fes­sion­ally, with cour­tesy and sen­si­tiv­ity, even though I some­times re­sponded ir­ri­ta­bly, when they had wo­ken me from deep slum­ber.</p>
    <p>We re­ported for our swab test on Day 11, at the ho­tel lobby, the only time we were al­lowed out of our rooms. It was not pleas­ant to have a thing shoved up your nose, but, hey ho, I sur­vived and tested neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>I don’t know how I would have coped in a small room with no bal­cony and the de­light­ful air of Sen­tosa, and with­out the space to do taiji, but it is pos­si­ble to tap the self-dis­ci­pline that en­forced iso­la­tion gifts you. I had a choice, to al­low time to drag and drown in mis­ery, or to take the op­por­tu­nity to dis­ci­pline mind and body.</p>
    <p>The ho­tel gave us a pleas­ant ex­pe­ri­ence, hats off to the staff, but it cer­tainly was no hol­i­day. It is a re­sort ho­tel, but the re­sort part of it was shut­tered. Per­haps it would have been cruel to tease us with a beach, sea or pool view.</p>
    <p>Would I re­peat the ex­pe­ri­ence? No, I like peo­ple too much and have no in­ten­tion of turn­ing into a her­mit.</p>
