    <p>Re­cently, there was a dis­cus­sion to end the ban of keep­ing cats in HDB flats. In all fair­ness, peo­ple should be al­lowed to keep all types of pets in their per­sonal prop­erty as long as in­con­ve­nience to oth­ers is min­imised.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, Aus­tralia me­dia re­ported on the costs of tox­o­plas­mo­sis, an in­fec­tion in­duced by the Tox­o­plasma gondii parasite. Mostly cats serve as a reser­voir for this parasite.</p>
    <p>If the ban on cats in flats is to be lifted even­tu­ally, it is also crit­i­cal to en­sure that quo­tas and mea­sures are put in place such that any spread of tox­o­plas­mo­sis is lim­ited in high-den­sity pop­u­lated areas like HDB flats.</p>
    <p>Cat own­ers may be aware of tox­o­plas­mo­sis, but neigh­bours that do not keep cats may not and it would be un­fair to sub­ject them to such risks by not en­forc­ing any quo­tas or even let­ting cats roam around freely between apart­ment units.</p>
    <p>There has been an in­creas­ing de­mand for pet species that do fac­tu­ally make safer com­pan­ion an­i­mals in terms of zoonotic dis­ease trans­mis­sion risk, and also tend to re­sult in less nui­sance com­plaints from neigh­bours. Should more of these species not be pro­moted in­stead like many other coun­tries have done?</p>
    <p>Some com­mon ex­am­ples are se­lec­tively bred leop­ard gecko and bearded drag­ons that are by def­i­ni­tion no longer wild an­i­mals.</p>
    <p>While there seems to be talk to amend the En­dan­gered Species Act, noth­ing has been men­tioned to pro­mote the lu­cra­tive le­git­i­mate trade in wildlife.</p>
    <p>Many fu­ture po­ten­tial pet species fall in this cat­e­gory and have been le­gal in nu­mer­ous coun­tries for decades. The keep­ing of such species has great eco­nomic and con­ser­va­tion value.</p>
    <p>Keep­ing species that are suited to cap­tiv­ity not only re­duces the ex­tinc­tion risk of the species as a whole but also has great eco­nomic po­ten­tial.</p>
    <p>If no lo­cal com­mer­cial value is at­trib­uted to in­ter­na­tion­ally trad­able wildlife species, it may well fa­cil­i­tate their ex­tinc­tion in­stead at the ex­pense of Sin­ga­pore los­ing out on fu­ture eco­nomic op­por­tu­ni­ties in this mar­ket seg­ment. Ong Junkai</p>
