    <p>BEI­JING • The United States should choose di­a­logue and con­sul­ta­tion with China in­stead of pur­su­ing “un­ac­cept­able” uni­lat­eral sanc­tions against Chi­nese com­pa­nies, China’s State Coun­cil­lor and For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He urged the US to stop “over­stretch­ing the no­tion of na­tional se­cu­rity” and the “ar­bi­trary sup­pres­sion” of Chi­nese com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>“We need to re­place sanc­tions with di­a­logue and con­sul­ta­tion,” he said in a special ad­dress to the Asia So­ci­ety that fo­cused mainly on the state of Sino-US re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton con­firmed yes­ter­day that it would add dozens of Chi­nese com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing the coun­try’s top chip­maker SMIC, to a trade black­list, a move seen as the lat­est in Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ef­forts to ce­ment his tough-on-China legacy.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has taken note of the four pol­icy pri­or­i­ties of US Pres­i­den­t­elect Joe Bi­den, Mr Wang added, and be­lieves at least three of them – Covid-19 re­sponse, eco­nomic re­cov­ery and cli­mate change – pro­vide room for co­op­er­a­tion be­tween the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“We hope that we will ex­pand co­op­er­a­tion and man­age dif­fer­ences through di­a­logue,” Mr Wang said. “It is im­por­tant that United States poli­cies to­wards China re­turn to ob­jec­tiv­ity and sus­tain­abil­ity as soon as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>His re­marks were the most de­tailed com­men­tary on US-China re­la­tions from a Chi­nese govern­ment of­fi­cial since Mr Bi­den’s vic­tory in the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>They are also the lat­est in a string of com­ments from top Chi­nese diplo­mats that hint at a de­sire to re­set re­la­tions be­tween the world’s two largest economies as Mr Bi­den pre­pares to take of­fice on Jan 20.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang set out a frame­work for im­prov­ing ties, call­ing on US politi­cians to stop crit­i­cis­ing China’s rul­ing Com­mu­nist Party and re­spect the coun­try’s in­ter­ests in the Xin­jiang and Ti­bet re­gions, where Bei­jing’s poli­cies have drawn widespread in­ter­na­tional crit­i­cism.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang also of­fered a dark as­sess­ment of the state of the USChina re­la­tion­ship at the end of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, say­ing re­la­tions had “spi­ralled down to the low­est level since the es­tab­lish­ment of diplo­matic ties” more than four decades ear­lier.</p>
    <p>“The go-it-alone ap­proach and walk­ing away from in­ter­na­tional com­mit­ments have frac­tured and crip­pled the in­ter­na­tional sys­tem,” he said.</p>
    <p>He also said US ef­forts to “re­model or sub­vert China” would be “mis­sion im­pos­si­ble”.</p>
    <p>Mr Kevin Rudd, Aus­tralia’s for­mer prime min­is­ter and cur­rent pres­i­dent of the Asia So­ci­ety Pol­icy In­sti­tute, added that con­fronta­tion be­tween the US and China had en­snared Amer­ica’s al­lies such as Ja­pan, South Korea and Aus­tralia, which now find them­selves “very much in the fir­ing line of ten­sions in the bi­lat­eral re­la­tion­ship”.</p>
    <p>Mr Rudd picked up on Mr Wang’s com­ments on the im­por­tance of face-to-face di­a­logue to put in a pitch for Aus­tralia, say­ing that he hoped their two gov­ern­ments would have such con­tact soon.</p>
