ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY COPYRIGHT AND PROTECTED BY APPLICABLE LAW The twin dome structures of Esplanade – Theatres by the Bay are unmistakab­le in Singapore’s cityscape. Designed by local firm DP Architects, the world- class performing arts centre is fitted with over 7,000 triangular aluminum sunshades, which gives it a spiky look that led the locals to nickname it “The Durian”. The 60,000 sq m building features a 1,600 -seat concert hall where orchestras from Singapore and around the world delight their audiences with their music performanc­es, as well as a
2,000 -seat theatre with state-of-the-art equipment that bring out the best effects for various shows such as plays and dance showcases. It also houses a recital studio, a theatre studio, an outdoor theatre, an annexe studio and several visual art exhibition spaces, as well as cafes, restaurant­s and shops. Since its opening in 2002, the Esplanade has been engaging people of all ages to engage in the local and internatio­nal ar ts and culture. It continues to maintain its standing as one of the outstandin­g performing arts centres in the region. PERANAKAN CHARM Class 406 D15 Landed house for sale COSY HOME Class 443 HDB flat for sale
