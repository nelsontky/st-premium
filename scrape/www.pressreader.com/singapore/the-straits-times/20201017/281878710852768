    <p>Un­til a Covid-19 vac­cine is avail­able, the world needs a health in­for­ma­tion sys­tem to restart free and safe in­ter­na­tional travel.</p>
    <p>What might this Covid-19-free travel in­fra­struc­ture look like, what lessons can we learn from the Swift fi­nan­cial mes­sag­ing sys­tem, and how to and who should im­ple­ment such a global health sys­tem?</p>
    <p>Swift – which stands for So­ci­ety for World­wide In­ter­bank Fi­nan­cial Telecom­mu­ni­ca­tion – is the world’s largest elec­tronic pay­ment mes­sag­ing sys­tem. What has a fi­nance sys­tem got to do with trace-track­ing Covid-19, one might won­der.</p>
    <p>A clue lies in what it ac­tu­ally does – it is a co­op­er­a­tive net­work set up by banks world­wide to trans­mit in­for­ma­tion about fi­nan­cial trans­ac­tions in a se­cure way.</p>
    <p>WHAT IS NEEDED</p>
    <p>Frame­works on Covid-19-free travel cur­rently re­volve around im­mu­nity pass­ports, and travel cor­ri­dors or “travel bub­bles”.</p>
    <p>What­ever the case, all op­tions for safe travel must be un­der­pinned by a truly global in­fra­struc­ture with sev­eral fun­da­men­tal fea­tures.</p>
    <p>First, the in­fra­struc­ture must en­able ac­cu­rate, ver­i­fi­able and tam­per-proof ex­change of rel­e­vant health in­for­ma­tion – such as the dates, meth­ods and re­sults of Covid-19 tests for trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>It must be in­ter­op­er­a­ble between the pub­lic health, lab­o­ra­tory and dis­ease sur­veil­lance sys­tems of dif­fer­ent coun­tries, while op­er­at­ing in a de­cen­tralised fash­ion with a ro­bust busi­ness con­ti­nu­ity plan.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, it must have ad­e­quate (but not per­fect) reg­u­la­tory har­mon­i­sa­tion between the pub­lic health, med­i­cal de­vices, pathol­ogy lab­o­ra­to­ries and im­mi­gra­tion reg­u­la­tors of all coun­tries, with mu­tual recog­ni­tion of ad­e­quate test­ing stan­dards and pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>Third, this in­fra­struc­ture must be con­sid­ered a global pub­lic good, which means it must be in­clu­sive – highly ac­ces­si­ble and gov­erned by as many stake­hold­ers as pos­si­ble – and re­spon­sive, with agile de­ci­sion-mak­ing dur­ing a pan­demic with rapidly evolv­ing sci­ence.</p>
    <p>Let’s call it the Covid-19-free and Healthy In­ter­na­tional Travel Sys­tem, or Chits. This should pro­vide a se­cure and ver­i­fi­able dig­i­tal iden­tity for trav­ellers tied to a trusted Covid-19 sta­tus. Let’s call this the Chit Code, a time-lim­ited unique iden­ti­fier that is an epi­demi­o­logic lin­gua franca ac­cepted glob­ally.</p>
    <p>The Chit Code is one piece of the jig­saw puz­zle of safe in­ter­na­tional travel, with other pieces be­ing move­ment tracker apps, travel in­sur­ance and pre-ap­proved itin­er­ar­ies.</p>
    <p>FROM SWIFT TO CHITS</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, there is a suc­cess­ful model for Chits to fol­low. Launched in 1977 and head­quar­tered in</p>
    <p>Bel­gium, the Swift sys­tem pro­vides ef­fi­cient and re­li­able plumb­ing for the gar­gan­tuan in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial sys­tem. To­day, it cov­ers over 200 coun­tries and 11,000 fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions, with a whop­ping 38 mil­lion daily trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Swift took four years to build, but Chits must and can be built faster.</p>
    <p>This speed can be achieved by build­ing on the ex­ist­ing Swift op­er­at­ing model and in­cor­po­rat­ing rel­e­vant non-Swift tech­nolo­gies such as blockchain, elec­tronic health records (EHR) and dig­i­tal iden­tity man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>There are three ad­di­tional unique fea­tures of Swift that can be bor­rowed by Chits.</p>
    <p>One, a co­op­er­a­tive model jointly owned by na­tional reg­u­la­tors and pub­lic and pri­vate health­care ser­vice providers is the fastest, most agile and least im­per­fect gov­er­nance and op­er­at­ing model. Gov­ern­ing the global health com­mons is dif­fi­cult, but there is a space for pri­vate pro­vi­sion and stew­ard­ship of pub­lic goods with rea­son­able profit-mak­ing.</p>
    <p>Two, Chits must act as a de facto stan­dard-set­ting in­ter­na­tional agency and be laid over the pub­lic health and lab­o­ra­tory in­fra­struc­ture of coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Bar­ri­ers to en­try must be ap­pro­pri­ately high with­out wors­en­ing health and sys­temic in­equal­i­ties. Chits must en­cour­age com­pe­ti­tion on price, speed, ac­ces­si­bil­ity and con­ve­nience of tests, while meeting the moral bur­den of test­ing qual­ity and ac­cu­racy.</p>
    <p>Three, Chits can pro­vide ad­di­tional tools be­yond iden­tity man­age­ment and Covid-19 sta­tus. Anti-fraud and com­pli­ance can be built into Chits us­ing a Big Data ap­proach.</p>
    <p>Ag­gre­gated, anonymised and real-time test­ing or move­ment data can be shared with epi­demi­ol­o­gists, reg­u­la­tors and re­searchers, or ap­pro­pri­ately shared with pri­vate en­ti­ties. Th­ese can pro­vide Chits with an ad­di­tional in­come stream on top of sub­scrip­tions or trans­ac­tion fees.</p>
    <p>NON-STATE PRO­VI­SION</p>
    <p>There are three steps to im­ple­ment­ing Chits.</p>
    <p>The pri­mary in­gre­di­ent is a con­sor­tium of non-state en­ti­ties will­ing and able to un­der­write the ini­tial in­vest­ment and in­fra­struc­ture-build­ing.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ments can pro­vide ini­tial lead­er­ship, but must be backed up by global health or­gan­i­sa­tions, foun­da­tions, phi­lan­thropies and the pri­vate sec­tor. Notable pri­vate in­dus­tries in­clude Big Tech, dig­i­tal health, EHR com­pa­nies, fi­nan­cial ser­vices and lo­gis­tics.</p>
    <p>Although the United Na­tions, supra­na­tional en­ti­ties such as the Euro­pean Union or re­gional en­ti­ties like Asean or the Eco­nomic Com­mu­nity of West African States would be ideal, they are not well placed to launch and gov­ern Chits with the speed and ef­fec­tive­ness that the world needs.</p>
    <p>Their bu­reau­cracy, veto pol­i­tics, pre-ex­ist­ing pri­or­i­ties and lack of ca­pac­ity ham­string their abil­i­ties. Con­versely, the pre-ex­ist­ing global in­fra­struc­ture of pri­vate sec­tor ac­tors is an ad­van­tage as it also re­solves dilem­mas about na­tion­al­ism, sovereignt­y and pride.</p>
    <p>Such a pub­lic-pri­vate con­sor­tium must then im­ple­ment trans­par­ent self-reg­u­la­tion based on strin­gent sci­en­tific and pub­lic health prin­ci­ples.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, Chits must be open-source and democra­tised, with a ro­bust pro­to­col to de­tect and ad­dress fraud and mis­takes.</p>
    <p>The global health in­fra­struc­ture that we build in re­sponse to Covid-19 will de­fine the 2020s. This pan­demic will not be hu­man­ity’s last, so there are good rea­sons to in­vest time, en­ergy, money, am­bi­tion and imag­i­na­tion into build­ing a Chits-like sys­tem for long-term use.</p>
    <p>ONE PIECE OF THE PUZ­ZLE</p>
    <p>Chits is nec­es­sary for re­open­ing bor­ders, but in­suf­fi­cient. Frame­works to en­sure ac­cu­racy, ver­i­fi­a­bil­ity and speed are cru­cial pieces of the over­all so­lu­tion for safe trav­els in the Covid-19 era.</p>
