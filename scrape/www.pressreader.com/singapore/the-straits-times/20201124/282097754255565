    <p>The trial of a Cen­tral Nar­cotics Bureau (CNB) of­fi­cer who is ac­cused of as­sault­ing a man sev­eral times to ex­tort a drug con­fes­sion be­gan yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cer, Vengedesh Raj Nainar Na­gara­jan, 33, de­nied al­le­ga­tions of vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing hurt to get a con­fes­sion from Malaysian Siv­a­balan Kan­niap­pan in 2017 af­ter he was found with drugs on him at Wood­lands Check­point.</p>
    <p>Vengedesh has been sus­pended from ser­vice since Oct 5 last year.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tor Han Ming Kuang said Vengedesh, then a cor­po­ral with the CNB, was called in for ad­di­tional sup­port at about 5am on Jan 2, 2017.</p>
    <p>He al­legedly took Siv­a­balan, 34, to the toi­let at the Wood­lands Check­point CNB Block B of­fice on the third storey on three sep­a­rate oc­ca­sions to ex­tort a con­fes­sion.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tion called three po­lice of­fi­cers as wit­nesses to the stand yes­ter­day. One was in­volved in fil­ing the first com­plaint against Vengedesh, while the other two were the in­ves­ti­gat­ing of­fi­cers who han­dled the case.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tion plans to call an­other 15 wit­nesses, in­clud­ing CNB and po­lice of­fi­cers, and rely on closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion footage, pho­to­graphs and di­a­grams of the CNB Wood­lands of­fice, as well as state­ments from Vengedesh, among other ev­i­dence, to make its case. Vengedesh is rep­re­sented by lawyer Peter Fer­nando.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Siv­a­balan was found guilty of drug of­fences and is serv­ing a 15-year jail term. He was also sen­tenced to 13 strokes of the cane.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments, be­tween 5.58am and 6.14am on Jan 2, 2017, Vengedesh al­legedly kicked, punched and slapped Siv­a­balan to get him to con­fess that he knew about a bun­dle of drugs found in his rain­coat bag.</p>
    <p>Be­tween 8.35am and 8.43am, Vengedesh is said to have kicked and punched Siv­a­balan again to get him to con­fess that the bun­dle of drugs con­tained heroin.</p>
    <p>The third as­sault is said to have taken place be­tween 9.28am and 9.30am to make Siv­a­balan con­fess that he knew about a sec­ond bun­dle of drugs.</p>
    <p>If convicted of the of­fence, Vengedesh can be jailed for up to seven years and fined or caned for each charge.</p>
    <p>The trial con­tin­ues to­day.</p>
