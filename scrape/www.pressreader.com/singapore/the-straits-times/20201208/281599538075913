    <p>Com­mu­ni­ties around the world should con­tinue ex­pand­ing dig­i­tal con­nec­tiv­ity and deepen pub­licpri­vate part­ner­ships so that ev­ery­one can reap the ben­e­fits of the In­ter­net, said Google chief executive Sun­dar Pichai yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>While Covid-19 has ac­cel­er­ated the use of dig­i­tal tools, it has also un­der­scored the fact that many have been left be­hind, he said at the Sin­ga­pore Fin­Tech Fes­ti­val and Sin­ga­pore Week of In­no­va­tion and Tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus out­break has sped up the adop­tion of dig­i­tal tools and trends by years, noted Mr Pichai.</p>
    <p>He added that South-east Asia’s In­ter­net econ­omy is on the verge of a mas­sive trans­for­ma­tion. He cited a re­port Google com­piled that showed over 40 mil­lion peo­ple in the re­gion con­nected to the In­ter­net for the first time this year – four times as many as last year.</p>
    <p>But many are still be­ing left out. Some 1.7 bil­lion peo­ple glob­ally are still un­banked, for ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>An In­ter­net con­nec­tion is the “sin­gle best way” to make tech­nol­ogy avail­able to more peo­ple, and Mr Pichai out­lined two ways to make the global dig­i­tal econ­omy more in­clu­sive.</p>
    <p>“First, by ac­cel­er­at­ing progress in clos­ing the dig­i­tal di­vide, which means ex­pand­ing con­nec­tiv­ity, fi­nan­cial in­clu­sion and dig­i­tal skills.</p>
    <p>“Sec­ond, by deep­en­ing part­ner­ships be­tween govern­ments and business, which means build­ing on the new col­lab­o­ra­tions we’ve seen dur­ing Covid.”</p>
    <p>Mi­crosoft’s chief executive Satya Nadella also spoke at the event yes­ter­day. Dur­ing a di­a­logue with Stan­dard Char­tered group chief executive Bill Win­ters, Mr Nadella re­flected on the pan­demic and said com­pa­nies need to plan ahead and pre­pare for fu­ture crises.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, the two firms an­nounced a part­ner­ship to ac­cel­er­ate the bank’s dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion through a cloud-first strat­egy and mi­grate all core ap­pli­ca­tions to the cloud by 2025.</p>
    <p>Mak­ing sure that ev­ery­one in an or­gan­i­sa­tion – not just cus­tomer ser­vice staff – lis­tens to client feed­back is cru­cial, said Mr Nadella. “Or­gan­i­sa­tions that have good lis­ten­ing sys­tems have been able to come out of this, or at least are work­ing through this cri­sis much bet­ter.”</p>
