    <p>BOTH EYE­ING SOFT POWER</p>
    <p>An un­fold­ing po­lit­i­cal cri­sis in Nepal is not only shak­ing up the na­tion, but could also fuel a re­shap­ing of its re­la­tions with its two gi­ant neigh­bours – In­dia and China.</p>
    <p>Nepal Prime Min­is­ter</p>
    <p>K. P. Sharma Oli, fearing a no-con­fi­dence mo­tion, has rec­om­mended the dis­so­lu­tion of Par­lia­ment two years ahead of the end of its five-year term, set­ting off a fresh bout of po­lit­i­cal in­sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>The move was trig­gered by a fall­ing out be­tween two fac­tions – one led by Mr Oli and the other by Mr Pushpa Ka­mal Da­hal – within the Nepal Com­mu­nist Party, a uni­fied party of left forces cre­ated in 2018 with help from China.</p>
    <p>China had played a big role in the uni­fi­ca­tion of the Com­mu­nist Party of Nepal (Uni­fied Marx­ist-Lenin­ist) and Com­mu­nist Party of Nepal (Maoist Cen­tre).</p>
    <p>In­dia has tra­di­tion­ally had the great­est in­flu­ence in Nepal, but this is be­ing chal­lenged in re­cent years by China.</p>
    <p>In the cur­rent cri­sis, it is China, not In­dia, which has stepped in very pub­licly.</p>
    <p>A Chi­nese del­e­ga­tion com­pris­ing se­nior fig­ures from the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party has been in Nepal speak­ing to all po­lit­i­cal lead­ers in what is widely seen as a bid to pre­vent the split of the party.</p>
    <p>The del­e­ga­tion has failed in its mis­sion, but has at­tracted crit­i­cism for in­ter­fer­ing in Nepal’s in­ter­nal mat­ter, a charge usu­ally re­served for In­dia.</p>
    <p>Through it, In­dia has watched silently even as it has kept chan­nels of com­mu­ni­ca­tion open with all po­lit­i­cal lead­ers. Ex­ter­nal af­fairs min­istry spokesman Anurag Sri­vas­tava, when asked about the de­vel­op­ments in Nepal, termed it an “in­ter­nal mat­ter” last week.</p>
    <p>Spec­u­la­tion is rife that there may be an ad­just­ment of Nepal’s ties with its big­ger neigh­bours once a new power struc­ture is in place.</p>
    <p>“China was in favour of a strong gov­ern­ment led by com­mu­nist par­ties... but with the party split, this has been se­ri­ously ham­pered. That is why China dis­patched a team to find out what is hap­pen­ing in Nepal,” said Kath­mandu-based jour­nal­ist and writer Ka­mal Dev Bhattarai.</p>
    <p>“In the frag­ile po­lit­i­cal sit­u­a­tion in Nepal, both In­dia and China may try to in­crease their in­flu­ence in Nepal. Politi­cians in Nepal may also try to seek sup­port from big pow­ers to get the power which will pro­vide space for them to in­crease in­flu­ence in Nepal. The frag­ile po­lit­i­cal sit­u­a­tion is not help­ful to Nepal’s for­eign pol­icy as well.”</p>
    <p>Ties be­tween Nepal and In­dia have had their ups and downs, with Nepal try­ing to wean it­self off its de­pen­dence on In­dia since 2016, when a block­ade of the main border cross­ings with the Asian gi­ant led to a short­age of fuel, medicine and other es­sen­tial items.</p>
    <p>China has since sub­stan­tially stepped up its pres­ence in Nepal.</p>
    <p>Over 90 per cent of for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment in Nepal is from China, and Nepal is also a part of the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive, which in­cludes rail and road con­nec­tiv­ity projects.</p>
    <p>Still, Mr Oli had in re­cent weeks been more amenable to im­prov­ing ties with In­dia, mak­ing diplo­matic over­tures af­ter a re­cent fall­ing out over border is­sues be­tween the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>South Asia ex­pert S.D. Muni said: “In­di­ans have also put in money but they don’t have as much money as the Chi­nese. China al­ready has a lot of space in Nepal. In­dia is try­ing to re­cover that... Cer­tainly, in In­dia, I think there is a lot of de­light on the break-up of the party.”</p>
    <p>“To my mind, the Chi­nese would be more in­ter­ested in the com­mu­nist party hege­mony.”</p>
    <p>In Nepal, fears are fo­cused on what is next for the coun­try, which has had sev­eral gov­ern­ments in fast suc­ces­sion over the past few decades. Many fear that a fresh round of elec­tions will lead to an un­sta­ble coali­tion. Oth­ers feel an elec­tion may not even take place.</p>
    <p>Protests, in­clud­ing by pro-monar­chy groups, have bro­ken out in Nepal against the move and pe­ti­tions have been filed in the Supreme Court against the bid to dis­solve Par­lia­ment, with some call­ing it an un­con­sti­tu­tional move.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts say the cri­sis will have an ad­verse im­pact on the econ­omy and gover­nance amid wor­ries over the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“The big­gest cause for the na­tion not mov­ing for­ward po­lit­i­cally was po­lit­i­cal in­sta­bil­ity. No party had a ma­jor­ity for the past 20 years,” said Mr Yubaraj Ghimire, a Kath­mandu-based jour­nal­ist who is ed­i­tor of Desh­san­char.com</p>
    <p>“When the left par­ties came to­gether in 2018, it had gen­er­ated new hope. Now that hope is gone.”</p>
    <p>In the frag­ile po­lit­i­cal sit­u­a­tion in Nepal, both In­dia and China may try to in­crease their in­flu­ence in Nepal. Politi­cians in Nepal may also try to seek sup­port from big pow­ers to get the power which will pro­vide space for them to in­crease in­flu­ence in Nepal.</p>
    <p>The frag­ile po­lit­i­cal sit­u­a­tion is not help­ful to Nepal’s for­eign pol­icy as well.</p>
