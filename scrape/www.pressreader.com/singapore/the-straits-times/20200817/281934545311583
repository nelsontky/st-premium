    <p>ED­IN­BURGH (Scot­land) • This spring, when West­ern Europe be­came an epi­cen­tre of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, coun­tries im­posed strict lock­downs: In France, a per­son needed a per­mit to go shop­ping; Spain re­quired chil­dren to stay in­doors the en­tire day; in Scot­land and Wales, peo­ple could go out­side for a walk only once a day and had to stay within an 8km ra­dius. Thanks to this, Euro­pean coun­tries were able to not only flat­ten the Covid-19 curve but to also keep lev­els of in­fec­tion very low.</p>
    <p>But as the weeks went by, the pres­sure to re­open so­ci­ety grew. Peo­ple wanted their pre-pan­demic lives back. They wanted dy­namic economies to pro­tect their jobs; they wanted their chil­dren ed­u­cated in schools; they wanted nights out at the pub and vis­its to their friends. And they re­ally wanted sum­mer va­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Tourism and travel, it turns out, is one of Europe’s par­tic­u­lar prob­lems. Tourism ac­counts for some €600 bil­lion (S$974 bil­lion) of the Euro­pean Union’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct. It pro­vides nearly 12 mil­lion peo­ple with em­ploy­ment di­rectly and an­other 15 mil­lion peo­ple with in­di­rect em­ploy­ment. And the sum­mer hol­i­day is a ver­i­ta­ble Euro­pean in­sti­tu­tion, made only more cen­tral to many peo­ple’s lives by the ad­vent of low-cost air travel.</p>
    <p>So this sum­mer, with the virus tamped down to what many gov­ern­ments con­sid­ered “ac­cept­able” lev­els – the UK Joint Biose­cu­rity Cen­tre, for ex­am­ple, has sug­gested that an ac­cept­able in­ci­dence for Bri­tain is 1,000 symp­tomatic new cases per day – coun­tries started to re­open and peo­ple be­gan to travel. Bri­tons and Ger­mans wanted to es­cape to the beaches; Spa­niards and</p>
    <p>Greeks wanted to see their tourism economies kept alive.</p>
    <p>But, pre­dictably, cases are start­ing to in­crease. Spain now has about 3,500 new coro­n­avirus cases per day, up from fewer than 700 at the end of May. Ger­many saw 1,445 new in­fec­tions one day last week, the high­est num­ber of daily in­fec­tions in more than three months. This should be a cause for se­ri­ous con­cern. The re­cent ex­pe­ri­ences of Is­rael and the state of Vic­to­ria in Aus­tralia show that even a hand­ful of daily new cases can eas­ily be­come hun­dreds and thou­sands.</p>
    <p>The rise in in­fec­tions in Europe seems par­tic­u­larly linked to ac­tiv­i­ties like bar hop­ping, club­bing and par­ty­ing among younger peo­ple, as well as the rush to wel­come in­ter­na­tional vis­i­tors and re­open tourism and its re­lated ac­tiv­i­ties. A “su­per-spread­ing event” at a club in the Span­ish city of Cor­doba re­sulted in 91 peo­ple test­ing pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>“We faced a lot of pres­sure from the tourist in­dus­try be­cause it’s one of the main eco­nomic sec­tors of Spain,” Dr Ja­cobo Men­dioroz, the di­rec­tor of the com­mit­tee re­spond­ing to Covid-19 in Cat­alo­nia, told Time. (Tourism ac­counts for around 15 per cent of Spain’s GDP.)</p>
    <p>Greece is look­ing to tighten lock­down again after a spike in cases fol­low­ing the re­turn of for­eign vis­i­tors. In the week after the coun­try opened its bor­ders in early July, more than 100 tourists tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>As tourists move around the var­i­ous coun­tries in the Euro­pean Union (and the re­cently de­parted Bri­tain) that are in vary­ing stages of eas­ing lock­down, cross-in­fec­tion across bor­ders con­tin­ues to oc­cur, mak­ing it a whack-a-mole game that is im­pos­si­ble to win.</p>
    <p>The only way to stop con­stant in­creases in the coro­n­avirus is to elim­i­nate com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion and to use ro­bust test, trace and iso­late poli­cies to con­tinue catch­ing im­ported cases and clus­ters as they emerge. New Zealand, Tai­wan, Cuba and Rwanda have each pur­sued this kind of max­i­mum sup­pres­sion through strict bor­der mea­sures and have largely re­turned to nor­mal pub­lic life.</p>
    <p>Stop­ping com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion re­quires manda­tory, en­forced quar­an­tine for in­com­ing trav­ellers and test­ing be­fore re­lease. Europe could do the same and co­op­er­ate across coun­tries to­wards this goal so that in­tra-Euro­pean travel and tourism can con­tinue when a safe bub­ble can be built.</p>
    <p>What would this ac­tu­ally look like?</p>
    <p>Lock­down mea­sures can bring case num­bers low enough that test­ing and trac­ing can break chains of trans­mis­sion. Euro­pean coun­tries have al­ready taken a se­vere eco­nomic and so­cial hit to con­tain Covid-19, but to fin­ish the job and truly crunch the curve they need to build up mas­sive di­ag­nos­tic ca­pac­ity, to be able to run large, fast and ac­cu­rate test­ing ser­vices. This is a dif­fi­cult project but not im­pos­si­ble: Ger­many has done it fairly suc­cess­fully.</p>
    <p>But here’s the less fun part: Euro­pean coun­tries need to in­tro­duce se­ri­ous lim­i­ta­tions on non-es­sen­tial travel un­til safe travel bub­bles can be built among coun­tries where the virus is low. The virus moves when peo­ple move. This does not mean bor­ders need to be closed. But peo­ple need to be tested on ar­rival in a new coun­try and then again five days later. There has to be en­forced iso­la­tion un­til two neg­a­tive tests at least five days apart. (Frankfurt, Ber­lin and Ham­burg air­ports have al­ready in­tro­duced com­pul­sory test­ing on ar­rival from higher-preva­lence coun­tries and note that it is work­ing well.)</p>
    <p>Yes, this will prob­a­bly in­ter­fere with plans to en­joy the beaches of Mar­bella. But the sum­mer, while in­fec­tion rates still re­main rel­a­tively low, is the only time to make this work.</p>
    <p>Go­ing into win­ter with hun­dreds of cases per day means risk­ing a steep rise once tem­per­a­tures cool, schools re­open and peo­ple head back in­doors. It means risk­ing a sec­ond round of na­tional lock­downs, which would be cat­a­strophic for men­tal health and for economies. (And let’s leave aside the ques­tion of whether or not it will ac­tu­ally be pos­si­ble to get peo­ple to com­ply the sec­ond time around.)</p>
    <p>Scot­land and North­ern Ire­land have looked ahead at the com­ing win­ter, and made a con­certed plan to min­imise com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion to avoid a se­ri­ous resur­gence of the virus by us­ing the sum­mer to drive cases as close to zero as pos­si­ble and to re­open cau­tiously. But nei­ther na­tion has con­trol over its bor­ders be­cause they are parts of the United King­dom. So both now face a stream of in­com­ing in­fec­tions from Eng­land and Wales, which are be­hav­ing more like the rest of Europe, as well as from peo­ple re­turn­ing from hol­i­days abroad and not abid­ing by govern­ment ad­vice to iso­late for 14 days.</p>
    <p>The in­ter­nal is­sues within the United King­dom pro­vide a glimpse of how the rest of Europe works. Be­cause of Europe’s eco­nomic and so­cial in­te­gra­tion, and free­dom-of-move­ment laws within the Euro­pean Union, a strat­egy to stop com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion of Covid-19 re­quires co­op­er­a­tion among Euro­pean lead­ers who each com­mit to na­tional mea­sures to drive in­fec­tions low in a con­certed and co­or­di­nated way, to reg­u­larly share in­for­ma­tion about progress, and to en­force strict checks on in­ter­na­tional travel.</p>
    <p>Work­ing to stop com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion might seem like a dream, but after hav­ing bent the curve so sig­nif­i­cantly – and taken the hard­est step of lock­down mea­sures – why not crunch the curve fully?</p>
    <p>Stop­ping com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion is the only path to stop the con­stant resur­gence of the coro­n­avirus, to re­open schools fully and safely and to avoid re­peated na­tional lock­down-and-re­lease cy­cles over the next 18 months. That should be a lot more im­por­tant than this sum­mer’s va­ca­tion.</p>
