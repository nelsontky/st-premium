    <p>UNITED STATES</p>
    <p>“HUGE break­through to­day! His­toric Peace Agree­ment be­tween our two GREAT friends, Is­rael and the United Arab Emi­rates!” US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump tweeted.</p>
    <p>He later told re­porters: “Ev­ery­body said this would be im­pos­si­ble... After 49 years Is­rael and the United Arab Emi­rates will fully nor­malise their diplo­matic re­la­tions.”</p>
    <p>US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo said: “The United States hopes that this brave step will be the first in a se­ries of agree­ments that ends 72 years of hos­til­i­ties in the re­gion.”</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial hope­ful Joe Bi­den said: “The UAE’s of­fer to pub­licly recog­nise the state of Is­rael is a wel­come, brave and bad­lyneeded act of states­man­ship.”</p>
    <p>National Se­cu­rity Ad­viser Robert O’Brien said Mr Trump “should be a front run­ner for the No­bel Peace Prize” for help­ing to bro­ker the deal.</p>
    <p>IS­RAEL</p>
    <p>“To­day a new era be­gan in the re­la­tions be­tween Is­rael and the Arab world,” Is­raeli Prime Min­is­ter Ben­jamin Ne­tanyahu said.</p>
    <p>De­fence Min­is­ter and al­ter­nate prime min­is­ter Benny Gantz called on other Arab na­tions to ad­vance diplo­matic re­la­tions in ad­di­tional peace pacts.</p>
    <p>UNITED ARAB EMI­RATES</p>
    <p>The UAE’s leader, Sheikh Mo­hamed bin Zayed, tweeted that “an agree­ment was reached to stop fur­ther Is­raeli an­nex­a­tion of Pales­tinian ter­ri­to­ries”.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter of State for For­eign Af­fairs An­war Gar­gash said: “Most coun­tries will see this as a bold step to se­cure a two-state so­lu­tion.”</p>
    <p>PALES­TINE</p>
    <p>The Pales­tinian Au­thor­ity voiced its “strong re­jec­tion and con­dem­na­tion” of the deal, with Pres­i­dent Mah­moud Ab­bas call­ing it an “ag­gres­sion” against the Pales­tinian peo­ple and a “be­trayal” of their cause, in­clud­ing their claim to Jerusalem as a cap­i­tal of their fu­ture state.</p>
    <p>“The agree­ment with the UAE is a re­ward for the Is­raeli oc­cu­pa­tion and crimes,” said Mr Hazem Qasem, spokesman for Pales­tinian Is­lamist group Ha­mas, which con­trols the Gaza Strip.</p>
    <p>IRAN</p>
    <p>Is­rael’s arch­en­emy Iran said the Pales­tinian peo­ple will “never for­give the nor­mal­is­ing of re­la­tions with the crim­i­nal Is­raeli oc­cu­pa­tion regime and the com­plic­ity in its crimes”. The move was an act of “strate­gic stu­pid­ity... that will un­doubt­edly strengthen the re­sis­tance axis in the re­gion”, its For­eign Min­istry said.</p>
    <p>TUR­KEY</p>
    <p>“While be­tray­ing the Pales­tinian cause to serve its nar­row in­ter­ests, the UAE is try­ing to present this as a kind of act of self-sac­ri­fice for Pales­tine,” Tur­key’s For­eign Min­istry said. “His­tory... will not for­get and never for­give this hyp­o­crit­i­cal be­hav­iour.”</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Re­cep Tayyip Erdogan said Tur­key would con­sider clos­ing its em­bassy in Abu Dhabi and sus­pend­ing diplo­matic ties with the UAE over the ac­cord.</p>
    <p>JOR­DAN</p>
    <p>Jor­dan said the out­come of the pact would de­pend on Is­rael’s ac­tions, in­clud­ing its stance on a two-state so­lu­tion with the Pales­tini­ans.</p>
    <p>EGYPT</p>
    <p>Egyp­tian Pres­i­dent Ab­del Fat­tah al-Sisi said he hoped the deal to halt Is­rael’s an­nex­a­tion of Pales­tinian land would help bring peace to the Mid­dle East.</p>
    <p>BRITAIN</p>
    <p>Bri­tish For­eign Sec­re­tary Do­minic Raab said: “This is a his­toric step... Ul­ti­mately, there is no sub­sti­tute for di­rect talks be­tween the Pales­tini­ans and Is­rael, which is the only way to a reach... a lasting peace.”</p>
    <p>UNITED NA­TIONS</p>
    <p>UN chief An­to­nio Guter­res said he hoped the deal would help re­alise a two-state so­lu­tion.</p>
