    <p>Ms Nu­ru­lasy­iqah Mo­ham­mad Taha, 35, has never ex­pe­ri­enced what it is like to walk on her own.</p>
    <p>She was born with spinal mus­cu­lar at­ro­phy (Type II) – a rare con­di­tion where the mus­cles weaken and waste away – and has to use a wheel­chair to get around.</p>
    <p>So she knows how im­por­tant ac­ces­si­bil­ity is for peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>She has been cap­tain of the Sin­ga­pore Boc­cia Pair team since 2008 and is a men­tor to other ath­letes of the sport from the Mus­cu­lar Dys­tro­phy As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore).</p>
    <p>In boc­cia, which re­quires ac­cu­racy and mus­cle con­trol, players throw or roll a ball to­wards a tar­get.</p>
    <p>For her achieve­ments as a twotime Par­a­lympian boc­cia ath­lete, as well as her po­ten­tial in the sport and will­ing­ness to serve the com­mu­nity, Ms Nu­ru­lasy­iqah was among 16 re­cip­i­ents of the Goh Chok Tong En­able Awards yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The award, an ini­tia­tive by the Me­di­a­corp En­able Fund, is now in its sec­ond year and is spon­sored by UBS Sin­ga­pore and the Tote Board.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob, in her speech at the award cer­e­mony held at the Is­tana, said: “Many of you have truly ex­em­pli­fied the spirit of pos­i­tiv­ity and re­silience. You have shown that per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties can also con­trib­ute and bring value to or­gan­i­sa­tions, busi­nesses and our so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>She called for more ef­forts to sup­port the in­te­gra­tion of those with dis­abil­i­ties into the wider com­mu­nity, es­pe­cially among em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>Emer­i­tus Se­nior Min­is­ter Goh Chok Tong, who is pa­tron of the fund, said the award eval­u­a­tion com­mit­tee de­cided to give out three more awards this year even though this meant that more had to be drawn from the bud­get.</p>
    <p>“2020 has been a very chal­leng­ing year for the com­mu­nity and for all of us. Liveli­hoods were af­fected. Rou­tines were dis­rupted. Dreams and as­pi­ra­tions were put on hold. It is right that we go the ex­tra mile to recog­nise more per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Our award win­ners to­day pos­sess qual­i­ties we hope to in­cul­cate in all our chil­dren. They are pos­i­tive, they are tena­cious, and they are self-mo­ti­vated. All of them want to give back to the com­mu­nity, to build a kinder, more in­clu­sive Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Ms Nu­ru­lasy­iqah said she was thank­ful and hum­bled to be among 12 who re­ceived the UBS Prom­ise award as well as $5,000 each. “But more im­por­tant is what I want to do with the award, which is to use it to do more for my com­mu­nity.”</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing four re­cip­i­ents got the UBS Achieve­ment award and re­ceived $10,000 each.</p>
    <p>With Sin­ga­pore hav­ing made progress in ac­ces­si­bil­ity in in­fra­struc­ture and pub­lic trans­port for peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties, Ms Nu­ru­lasy­iqah hopes to cham­pion greater ac­ces­si­bil­ity to fi­nan­cial and ed­u­ca­tional re­sources.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, for some peo­ple with mus­cu­lar dys­tro­phy, they don’t have the fi­nan­cial means to af­ford mo­bil­ity equip­ment that is cus­tomised and suited for their needs. There needs to be more fi­nan­cial sup­port for them,” she said.</p>
    <p>A cus­tomised wheel­chair can cost more than $10,000.</p>
    <p>The award cer­e­mony, held on the In­ter­na­tional Day of Per­sons with Dis­abil­i­ties yes­ter­day, also marked the start of the vir­tual En­abling Lives Fes­ti­val, or­gan­ised by SG En­able, an agency ded­i­cated to serv­ing peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The fes­ti­val, which will run un­til Dec 22, is meant to cel­e­brate dis­abil­ity in­clu­sion ef­forts and the achieve­ments of those with dis­abil­i­ties, as well as strengthen con­nec­tions and spark col­lab­o­ra­tions within the dis­abil­ity com­mu­nity, said SG En­able chief ex­ec­u­tive Ku Geok Boon.</p>
    <p>The fes­ti­val in­cludes vir­tual work­shops, panel dis­cus­sions and per­for­mances, as well as an on­line i’mable gift mar­ket sell­ing hand­crafted prod­ucts by artists and ar­ti­sans with dis­abil­i­ties from so­cial ser­vice agen­cies and so­cial en­ter­prises.</p>
    <p>Our award win­ners to­day pos­sess qual­i­ties we hope to in­cul­cate in all our chil­dren. They are pos­i­tive, they are tena­cious, and they are self-mo­ti­vated.</p>
    <p>All of them want to give back to the com­mu­nity, to build a kinder, more in­clu­sive Sin­ga­pore.</p>
