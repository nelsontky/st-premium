    <p>Mi­grant work­ers in some dor­mi­to­ries will be able to re­turn to the com­mu­nity once a month in a pi­lot scheme start­ing in the first quar­ter of next year, the au­thor­i­ties an­nounced yesterday.</p>
    <p>This will be sub­ject to com­pli­ance with ros­tered rou­tine test­ing, wear­ing of con­tact trac­ing de­vices and safe liv­ing mea­sures, Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Man­power Tan See Leng said dur­ing a mul­ti­min­istry task force vir­tual press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>The move will fol­low the dis­tri­bu­tion of con­tact trac­ing de­vices to more than 450,000 work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries or work­ing in the con­struc­tion, marine and process sec­tors which is to be com­pleted by the end of this month.</p>
    <p>Th­ese de­vices, called BluePass To­kens, are aimed at im­prov­ing the abil­ity to iso­late and ringfence po­ten­tial cases once they are de­tected, said a joint state­ment by the Min­istry of Health and Min­istry of Man­power.</p>
    <p>The pi­lot scheme comes af­ter the an­nounce­ment by Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong yesterday that Singapore will en­ter the third phase of its re­open­ing on Dec 28.</p>
    <p>Eas­ing of re­stric­tions in mi­grant worker dor­mi­to­ries be­gan last month. Work­ers in dorms have been un­der move­ment re­stric­tions since April, when the first dorms were gazetted as iso­la­tion ar­eas af­ter a spike in cases.</p>
    <p>Work­ers from ap­proved dor­mi­to­ries can now use com­mu­nal fa­cil­i­ties to cook their own food on rest days and recre­ational fa­cil­i­ties such as gyms and bas­ket­ball courts.</p>
    <p>They can also visit spec­i­fied re­cre­ation cen­tres on their rest days, although the work­ers are still largely re­quired to stay in their dorms ex­cept when they are go­ing to work or run­ning es­sen­tial er­rands.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan said work­ers will be able to visit re­cre­ation cen­tres more of­ten for their ev­ery­day needs, such as for re­mit­tance ser­vices or to visit the bar­ber.</p>
    <p>“We are also work­ing with recre­ational cen­tres to bring in more ac­tiv­i­ties, in­clud­ing movie and sports screen­ing, some pasar malam (night mar­ket) per­haps,” he added.</p>
    <p>He stressed that the cri­sis is far from over, even as more re­stric­tions are eased in the com­ing weeks and months.</p>
    <p>Mea­sures must con­tinue to be taken, such as the wear­ing of BluePass To­kens so that iso­la­tion can be done very quickly if there is a new in­fec­tion, he said.</p>
    <p>As part of ef­forts to keep mi­grant work­ers safe and to en­sure that any new cases or clus­ters are de­tected and con­tained quickly, the au­thor­i­ties will con­tinue their “multi-layered strat­egy” of ag­gres­sive rou­tine test­ing us­ing both the poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) as well as anti­gen rapid test­ing, ac­com­pa­nied by iso­la­tion strate­gies.</p>
    <p>Ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of all work­ers still sus­cep­ti­ble to in­fec­tion will con­tinue. All such work­ers who have been stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries and those who work in the con­struc­tion, marine and process sec­tors have been tested once ev­ery 14 days.</p>
    <p>Af­ter sev­eral rounds of such tests, the num­ber of new in­fec­tions has re­mained very low, said the joint state­ment. “Since Oc­to­ber, no new cases were de­tected in the dor­mi­to­ries on many days.”</p>
    <p>New dor­mi­to­ries are also be­ing built, with im­proved safety stan­dards to min­imise the risk of a resur­gence of Covid-19 among mi­grant work­ers, and pre­vent new pub­lic health threats, said the state­ment.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the ear­li­est co­hort of mi­grant work­ers who have re­cov­ered from Covid-19 and are cur­rently ex­empt from rou­tine test­ing are be­ing mon­i­tored to see how their an­ti­bod­ies change over time.</p>
    <p>Rou­tine test­ing will re­sume for th­ese work­ers if their an­ti­bod­ies start to fade, or if there is ev­i­dence of re­in­fec­tion among them.</p>
    <p>AC­TIV­I­TIES FOR WORK­ERS</p>
    <p>We are also work­ing with recre­ational cen­tres to bring in more ac­tiv­i­ties, in­clud­ing movie and sports screen­ing, some pasar malam (night mar­ket) per­haps.</p>
