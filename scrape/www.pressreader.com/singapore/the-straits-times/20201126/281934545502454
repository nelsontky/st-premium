    <p>The head of the Euro­pean Union’s ex­ec­u­tive has re­ported “gen­uine progress” in Brexit talks but said the risk of Britain leav­ing the EU with­out a new trade deal on Dec 31 re­mained, an out­come she said the bloc was pre­pared for.</p>
    <p>Britain and the EU are in a last­ditch ef­fort to agree on terms to keep trade flow­ing with­out tar­iffs or quo­tas from the start of next year, af­ter Lon­don’s cur­rent stand­still transition out of the 27-na­tion bloc ends. “The next days are go­ing to be de­ci­sive,” said Euro­pean Com­mis­sion pres­i­dent Ur­sula von der Leyen yes­ter­day. “The Euro­pean Union is well pre­pared for a nodeal sce­nario, but of course we pre­fer to have an agree­ment.”</p>
    <p>She added: “With very lit­tle time ahead of us, we will do all in our power to reach an agree­ment. We are ready to be cre­ative. But we are not ready to put into ques­tion the in­tegrity of our sin­gle mar­ket.”</p>
    <p>Ne­go­tia­tors have agreed on the out­line of a new part­ner­ship treaty on goods and ser­vices, as well as on trans­port, she said, adding that “gen­uine progress” had been made on is­sues from ju­di­cial co­op­er­a­tion to co­or­di­nat­ing wel­fare ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>An EU of­fi­cial in­volved in the ne­go­ti­a­tions said a deal was pos­si­ble, but not likely be­fore the week­end at the ear­li­est.</p>
    <p>The three main ob­sta­cles to a deal are shar­ing out fish­ing quo­tas and agree­ing on ac­cess to wa­ters, find­ing ways to set­tle fu­ture dis­putes, and en­sur­ing eco­nomic fair play for com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing on state aid.</p>
    <p>“We need to es­tab­lish ro­bust mech­a­nisms, en­sur­ing that com­pe­ti­tion is – and re­mains – free and fair over time. In the dis­cus­sions about state aid, we still have se­ri­ous is­sues, for in­stance when it comes to en­force­ment,” said Dr von der Leyen.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man con­ser­va­tive said the EU needed to be able to re­tal­i­ate on trade if Britain un­der­cuts labour or en­vi­ron­men­tal stan­dards, and wanted long-term pre­dictabil­ity for its fish­ing sec­tor, which faces a re­duced catch af­ter Brexit.</p>
    <p>A se­nior Bri­tish min­is­ter, Mr Michael Gove, said on Tues­day that the EU would have to move for there to be a new part­ner­ship agree­ment.</p>
    <p>EU states have pushed the com­mis­sion – which is ne­go­ti­at­ing with Britain on be­half of the bloc – to up­date con­tin­gency plans for a no-deal out­come, though the ex­ec­u­tive has so far held off.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cial in­volved in the talks said the plans would be up­dated only next week if a deal has still not been reached, adding that EU and Bri­tish ideas for so­lu­tions on the three main con­tentious is­sues – which in­clude putting transition pe­ri­ods and re­view clauses in the deal – were “dra­mat­i­cally dif­fer­ent”.</p>
    <p>While the EU wants to lock in joint pro­duc­tion stan­dards for the fu­ture, as well as en­sur­ing a longterm per­spec­tive for its fish­ing in­dus­try, the of­fi­cial said, Britain wanted to be able to drop any such com­mit­ments af­ter sev­eral years.</p>
