    <p>De­vel­op­ment in Sin­ga­pore will be done in a way that is more sen­si­tive to wildlife, un­der sweep­ing changes made to the en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact as­sess­ment (EIA) frame­work.</p>
    <p>Three key changes will be made to the frame­work, which was first in­tro­duced in 2008.</p>
    <p>One change in­volves the in­tro­duc­tion of bio­di­ver­sity im­pact as­sess­ment guide­lines, which were de­vel­oped by the Na­tional Parks Board (NParks) in con­sul­ta­tion with ex­perts here.</p>
    <p>The guide­lines, sim­i­lar to those al­ready in place for noise or pol­lu­tion con­trol at work sites, will en­sure that con­sul­tants as­sess­ing sites marked for de­vel­op­ment have a set of stan­dards to fol­low.</p>
    <p>An­other change will see the trans­parency of en­vi­ron­men­tal stud­ies en­hanced, with the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity (URA) spelling out on its web­site the cir­cum­stances un­der which such stud­ies must be done.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, an en­vi­ron­men­tal study must be done if the de­vel­op­ment works are lo­cated close to an area of eco­log­i­cal sig­nif­i­cance, such as nature re­serves.</p>
    <p>And with the ex­cep­tion of re­ports that con­tain sen­si­tive in­for­ma­tion, such as those with se­cu­rity con­sid­er­a­tions, all en­vi­ron­men­tal study re­ports will now be pub­lished on­line by de­vel­op­ers, and the links will be made avail­able on URA’s web­site.</p>
    <p>The third change will see the plan­ning process – and not just the de­vel­op­ment work it­self – be­come more sen­si­tive to Sin­ga­pore’s nat­u­ral en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>This will be done through ear­lier en­gage­ment with nature groups in the plan­ning and de­vel­op­ment process, and through the in­tro­duc­tion of a course on ba­sic ecol­ogy and the EIA process for plan­ners from de­vel­op­ment agen­cies. The course, to be con­ducted by NParks, will be rolled out by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>While these changes to the frame­work are not of­fi­cially cod­i­fied in an EIA law, the frame­work still has reg­u­la­tory teeth, the Min­istry of Na­tional De­vel­op­ment told The Straits Times last week.</p>
    <p>The re­cently amended Wildlife Act, which came into force on June 1, em­pow­ers NParks to is­sue wildlif­er­e­lated re­quire­ments as for­mal di­rec­tions to de­vel­op­ers and en­ables the board to take di­rect en­force­ment ac­tion against de­vel­op­ers that fail to com­ply with the re­quired mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore may be densely built up, but it still has green spa­ces that are home to wildlife.</p>
    <p>How­ever, as a small na­tion with just 720 sq km of land, Sin­ga­pore has al­ways had to strike a bal­ance between de­vel­op­ment and con­ser­va­tion, said Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Des­mond Lee, who had cham­pi­oned the changes to the EIA frame­work, in an e-mail to ST.</p>
    <p>“We must pro­tect and en­hance our nat­u­ral cap­i­tal. At the same time, we must house a na­tion, de­velop in­dus­try, cre­ate jobs, pro­vide ameni­ties and safe­guard land for fu­ture gen­er­a­tions – this is why it is crit­i­cal that we con­sider the trade-offs we are mak­ing care­fully with re­gard to land use, in the spirit of achiev­ing a bal­ance,” he said last week.</p>
    <p>“We out­lined our plans for a City in Nature ear­lier this year, and recog­nise that our plan­ning pro­cesses must be en­hanced in tan­dem to sup­port this vi­sion.”</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the nature com­mu­nity wel­comed the changes to the EIA frame­work, say­ing that they put Sin­ga­pore on the right track to achiev­ing its City in Nature vi­sion.</p>
    <p>Mr Sankar Anan­tha­narayanan, co-founder of nature group Her­peto­log­i­cal So­ci­ety of Sin­ga­pore, which stud­ies rep­tiles and am­phib­ians, said he is glad to see ef­forts to make EIA re­ports more trans­par­ent.</p>
    <p>“Pre­vi­ously, get­ting in­for­ma­tion was very dif­fi­cult and a lot of the en­gage­ment was done be­hind closed doors. Mak­ing the in­for­ma­tion more ac­ces­si­ble could boost dis­cus­sion on the find­ings. It’s a big step for­ward,” said Mr Sankar.</p>
    <p>Ac­cess to ear­lier EIA re­ports, like the one done for the Cross Is­land MRT Line, was ini­tially rel­a­tively lim­ited as an ap­point­ment had to be made to view a phys­i­cal copy of the roughly 1,000-page re­port. The Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity later put the doc­u­ment on­line fol­low­ing com­plaints about the in­con­ve­nience.</p>
    <p>For Nature So­ci­ety (Sin­ga­pore) pres­i­dent Shawn Lum, the changes to the EIA frame­work are sig­nif­i­cant also for what they rep­re­sent – in­creas­ing aware­ness of na­tive bio­di­ver­sity not just for in­di­vid­ual projects, but also at a na­tional level.</p>
    <p>“EIAs done for each project may be thor­ough, and mit­i­ga­tion mea­sures could help safe­guard bio­di­ver­sity within the project site. But their ef­fec­tive­ness may be re­duced if you con­sider the de­vel­op­ment around it,” said Dr Lum.</p>
    <p>Take, for in­stance, the new Ten­gah town, which will be built on sec­ondary for­est. The Hous­ing Board had catered for a for­est cor­ri­dor to run through the de­vel­op­ment to al­low an­i­mals to cross between the western catch­ment forests and the cen­tral nature re­serves.</p>
    <p>But last Oc­to­ber, ST re­ported that part of the green high­way in the plot next to Ten­gah was lev­elled for an HDB Build-To-Or­der project. Said Dr Lum: “Such in­ci­dents are not the fault of the de­vel­oper. So rais­ing the stan­dards of the in­dus­try, such as hav­ing ecol­ogy lessons for the plan­ners, could help re­duce such events.”</p>
    <p>MORE TRANS­PARENCY FOR RE­PORTS</p>
