    <p>When the Covid-19 pan­demic struck ear­lier this year, lo­cal clean­ing so­lu­tions com­pany Spic & Span re­for­mu­lated its dis­in­fec­tant so­lu­tion Speco to be ef­fec­tive against coro­n­aviruses. The prod­uct is now be­ing used across more than 1 mil­lion sq ft of prop­erty, in­clud­ing at Changi Airport.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Sin­ga­pore-based Lu­cence Di­ag­nos­tics, which spe­cialises i n quick and ac­cu­rate blood tests to de­tect can­cer, used its ex­per­tise to develop a Covid-19 saliva sam­pling kit, to­gether with the Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search (A*Star).</p>
    <p>Spic & Span and Lu­cence Di­ag­nos­tics were among seven re­cip­i­ents of the In­tel­lec­tual Prop­erty Of­fice of Sin­ga­pore (Ipos) In­no­va­tion for Hu­man­ity Award yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>They were lauded by Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth and Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Law Ed­win Tong in his open­ing speech at this year’s IP Week @ SG.</p>
    <p>“These re­cip­i­ents have demon­strated great re­silience in trans­form­ing their busi­nesses with IP (in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty), for both en­ter­prise growth and so­cial im­pact,” said Mr Tong who de­liv­ered his speech via a live video feed.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, Spic & Span was able to ex­pand its mar­ket pres­ence quickly and con­fi­dently with the re­for­mu­lated dis­in­fec­tant be­cause of a ro­bust IP strat­egy de­vel­oped even be­fore the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong noted that it is cru­cial for com­pa­nies to man­age and har­ness IP to sur­vive and flour­ish dur­ing the pan­demic, when many have had to relook their strate­gies.</p>
    <p>The two firms are suc­cess­ful ex­am­ples of com­pa­nies that have done so, he added. Prod­ucts de­vel­oped by other award re­cip­i­ents in­clude a mass screen­ing swab booth, a re­us­able N95-grade face mask and a ther­mal scan­ner which mea­sures body tem­per­a­ture.</p>
    <p>Lu­cence Di­ag­nos­tics li­censed the tech­nol­ogy for its saliva sam­pling kit from A*Star and tapped its know-how to quickly bring the prod­uct to mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The kit al­lows for saliva in the back of the nose and throat to be col­lected and trans­ported at room tem­per­a­ture dur­ing Covid-19 test­ing, in­stead of in a re­frig­er­ated en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>This means tests can be done at more places. The kit is cur­rently un­der­go­ing eval­u­a­tion in Sin­ga­pore and is com­mer­cially avail­able in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Lu­cence Di­ag­nos­tics chief ex­ec­u­tive Tan Min-Han said: “Today, Covid-19 test­ing through swab­bing is painful and in­va­sive, and saliva test­ing solves many of these chal­lenges.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tong also an­nounced var­i­ous ini­tia­tives aimed at help­ing more en­ter­prises cap­ture op­por­tu­ni­ties through IP. These in­clude an en­hanced scheme that ac­cel­er­ates the reg­is­tra­tion process for trade­marks and regis­tered de­signs. SG IP Fast, which pre­vi­ously cov­ered only patents, ap­plies to in­ven­tions across all tech­nol­ogy fields.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment will also part­ner with var­i­ous sec­tors to pro­vide com­pa­nies with in­dus­try-spe­cific re­sources and tools to bet­ter man­age their IP, such as through a new we­bi­nar se­ries, be­gin­ning with the arts and en­ter­tain­ment sec­tors this week.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong said: “These are chal­leng­ing and un­usual times... (but) Sin­ga­pore is com­mit­ted to main­tain­ing its ro­bust and for­ward-look­ing IP regime.”</p>
