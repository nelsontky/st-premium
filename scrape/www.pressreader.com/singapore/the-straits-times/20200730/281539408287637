    <p>Hong Kong’s con­firmed Covid-19 in­fec­tions have sur­passed the 3,000 mark, as it recorded more than 100 new cases for the eighth con­sec­u­tive day, putting yet more pres­sure on the health­care sys­tem.</p>
    <p>At the daily brief­ing yes­ter­day, the health au­thor­i­ties said 113 of the 118 new cases were due to lo­cal spread.</p>
    <p>The total tally of cases is now 3,002, in­clud­ing 24 deaths.</p>
    <p>Over the past five weeks, com­mu­nity out­breaks have been grow­ing at a faster pace than the health­care ser­vices can cope with, prompt­ing in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­perts to urge peo­ple to stay in­doors.</p>
    <p>In her stark­est warn­ing yet, Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam said in a video re­leased yes­ter­day: “We are on the verge of a large-scale com­mu­nity out­break, which may lead to a col­lapse of our hos­pi­tal sys­tem and cost lives, es­pe­cially of the el­derly.</p>
    <p>“In or­der to pro­tect our loved ones, our health­care staff and Hong Kong, I ap­peal to you to fol­low strictly the so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures and stay at home as far as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>Within the span of just eight days, the city added al­most 1,000 new pa­tients – 30 per cent of the total tally since the virus first hit the city in late Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>While Hong Kong has one of the low­est fa­tal­ity rates in the world, the num­ber of deaths has ac­cel­er­ated in the past weeks. This month alone, there were 17 deaths, many of whom were el­derly peo­ple.</p>
    <p>In the past few days, there have been re­ports that Covid-19 pa­tients have had to wait for days to be ad­mit­ted to hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>Dr Sara Ho, chief man­ager for pa­tient safety and risk man­age­ment at Hos­pi­tal Au­thor­ity, a statu­tory body, said at the brief­ing that from as early as Satur­day, the Asi­aWorld-Expo con­ven­tion cen­tre can be used to house pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Hours be­fore the brief­ing, Dr Arisina Ma, pres­i­dent of the Pub­lic</p>
    <p>Doc­tors’ As­so­ci­a­tion, said: “If we re­ally run out of any iso­la­tion fa­cil­i­ties or iso­la­tion hos­pi­tal beds, han­dling some very sta­ble pa­tients at home is an­other op­tion.”</p>
    <p>She said on lo­cal ra­dio RTHK that the tight liv­ing en­vi­ron­ment in the city drives the need for more iso­la­tion fa­cil­i­ties for those wait­ing to be ad­mit­ted to hos­pi­tal who live with el­derly rel­a­tives.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment moved on Mon­day to tighten re­stric­tions fur­ther, with pub­lic gath­er­ings halved to two since yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The rule on wear­ing masks at all times in out­door pub­lic places also took ef­fect, while eater­ies can pro­vide only take­aways. Sports cen­tres and swim­ming pools were added to the list of venues or­dered to shut for seven days till Aug 4.</p>
    <p>The coron­avirus pan­demic has weighed heav­ily on con­sumer spend­ing, trade and tourism in Hong Kong, adding to the econ­omy’s re­ces­sion­ary woes.</p>
    <p>Ad­vance es­ti­mates re­leased yes­ter­day showed that the econ­omy shrank by 9 per cent year on year in the se­cond quar­ter, although this beat some fore­casts.</p>
