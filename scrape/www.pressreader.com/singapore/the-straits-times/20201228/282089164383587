    <p>The reg­u­la­tory lapses found at Con­cord In­ter­na­tional Hos­pi­tal (CIH) were not linked to the man­age­ment of any Covid-19 cases, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This is based on the min­istry’s in­spec­tion thus far, said an MOH spokesman.</p>
    <p>The pri­vate hos­pi­tal in Adam Road, which spe­cialises in cancer treat­ment, was en­listed by MOH to care for Covid-19 pa­tients who were clin­i­cally well but tested pos­i­tive for the virus from March to Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>On Satur­day, MOH said it had or­dered CIH to tem­po­rar­ily stop pro­vid­ing all health­care ser­vices from Dec 19, af­ter it found sev­eral sig­nif­i­cant breaches of the Pri­vate Hos­pi­tals and Med­i­cal Clin­ics Act dur­ing in­spec­tions. “Mul­ti­ple life-sav­ing equip­ment and med­i­ca­tions were ei­ther not main­tained or not avail­able in crit­i­cal ar­eas of the hos­pi­tal such as the in­ten­sive care unit and the op­er­at­ing theatre,” said MOH.</p>
    <p>“There was also a lack of qual­ity con­trol in the lab­o­ra­tory and in­fec­tion con­trol pro­cesses, which poses sig­nif­i­cant risks to pa­tient safety and well-be­ing.”</p>
    <p>MOH has asked CIH to work with its med­i­cal team to re­view the treat­ment plans and en­sure proper con­ti­nu­ity of care for four pa­tients who had on­go­ing out­pa­tient med­i­cal ap­point­ments as of Dec 19, while the hos­pi­tal ad­dresses its lapses.</p>
    <p>The hos­pi­tal could not be reached for com­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Last Wed­nes­day, af­ter its op­er­a­tions had been stopped, CIH said in a Face­book post that it had wel­comed new man­age­ment at the end of last month.</p>
    <p>CIH also said it was ren­o­vat­ing the hos­pi­tal, im­prov­ing pro­to­cols and in­tro­duc­ing new ser­vices “with in­put from MOH in view of the change of own­er­ship”.</p>
    <p>It added that the hos­pi­tal will re­launch un­der a new name at the end of next month, with “new spe­cial­i­ties and unique treat­ments”.</p>
