    <p>Con­fi­dence in over­seas travel is grow­ing among Sin­ga­pore’s tra­di­tional top sources of vis­i­tors, with three in four leisure trav­ellers and nine in 10 busi­ness trav­ellers in­di­cat­ing that they are likely to go abroad in the year ahead, a re­cent sur­vey has found.</p>
    <p>The on­line sur­vey of 14 key mar­kets, com­mis­sioned by the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB), also found that re­spon­dents had a strong per­cep­tion of Sin­ga­pore as a safe des­ti­na­tion to visit amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>This bodes well for the tourism sec­tor’s re­cov­ery even though travel re­stric­tions and quar­an­tine rules mean it will likely be some time be­fore de­mand picks up, Mr Chang Chee Pey, as­sis­tant chief ex­ec­u­tive of STB’s in­ter­na­tional group, told the me­dia yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Re­cent break­throughs on the vac­cine front pro­vide some light</p>
    <p>at the end of the tun­nel, al­though it could still take months or years for vac­cines to be dis­trib­uted glob­ally, he noted.</p>
    <p>As part of STB’s prepa­ra­tions for the safe and grad­ual re­turn of in­ter</p>
    <p>na­tional travel, it is launch­ing a platform to help shape the fu­ture of tourism.</p>
    <p>Called Sin­gapoReimag­ine, it will kick off with a se­ries of fo­rums here and around the world to share knowl­edge and ex­change ideas on re­shap­ing global travel.</p>
    <p>There will also be en­gage­ments with stake­hold­ers at home to spur the re­newal of Sin­ga­pore’s tourism of­fer­ings.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 has dev­as­tated our in­dus­try, but it has also given us a once-in-a-life­time op­por­tu­nity to re­set, and re-imag­ine what travel and tourism should be for the next gen­er­a­tion,” Mr Chang said dur­ing a launch event at Sands Expo and Con­ven­tion Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>STB’s as­sis­tant chief ex­ec­u­tive (mar­ket­ing group) Lynette Pang said that trav­ellers of the fu­ture are likely to travel less fre­quently, seek greater value and pri­ori­tise safety, hy­giene and sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>To that end, Sin­ga­pore’s tourism sec­tor is re­shap­ing it­self with a fo­cus on ro­bust hy­giene and safety stan­dards, tech­nol­ogy-driven ex­pe­ri­ences and in­te­grat­ing na­ture and ur­ban land­scapes, she said. Ex­am­ples in­clude con­tact­less touch­points, hybrid phys­i­cal and on­line events and the up­com­ing Mandai eco-tourism hub and Jurong Lake District tourism de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Chang said Ma­rina Bay Sands’ newly launched hybrid stu­dio, which hosted about 200 view­ers for yes­ter­day’s in-per­son and on­line event, is also used to beam broad­cast-qual­ity vi­su­als and holo­grams world­wide. He added: “This is just one ex­am­ple of what we think the fu­ture will look like.”</p>
    <p>The sec­ond part of a guide on how meet­ing, in­cen­tive, con­ven­tion and ex­hi­bi­tion (Mice) events can be held safely amid the coronaviru­s pan­demic was also an­nounced yes­ter­day. It ex­pands on busi­ness model de­vel­op­ment and other ca­pa­bil­i­ties re­quired to help firms in the Mice in­dus­try pivot to the hybrid event model.</p>
    <p>Dr Ed­ward Koh, who is STB’s ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of convention­s, meet­ings and in­cen­tive travel, said that he is op­ti­mistic about the di­rec­tion that the travel and tourism in­dus­try is tak­ing.</p>
    <p>“Can­cel­la­tions for Mice events have ta­pered off, and we have many events from 2021 on­wards that are now wait­ing to see the pro­to­cols that we have in place,” he said.</p>
