    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) • The lat­est round of Covid-19 test­ing con­ducted inside the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion’s (NBA) “bub­ble” at Dis­ney World found zero pos­i­tive cases out of 346 play­ers tested, the league said on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>In a brief state­ment, the NBA said the lat­est fig­ures re­lated to test­ing car­ried out since July 13, when re­sults of the last wave of tests were announced.</p>
    <p>“In the event that a player on the NBA cam­pus re­turns a con­firmed pos­i­tive test in the future, he will be iso­lated un­til he is cleared for leav­ing iso­la­tion un­der the rules es­tab­lished by the NBA and the Play­ers As­so­ci­a­tion,” it added.</p>
    <p>On July 13, the league said that two play­ers had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 since ar­riv­ing in Or­lando, where the league is gear­ing up for its sea­son restart on July 30.</p>
    <p>How­ever nei­ther player had fully cleared quar­an­tine and had not en­tered the NBA’s “bub­ble”.</p>
    <p>The com­pe­ti­tion has been in shut­down since the pan­demic’s out­set in March, but teams will be play­ing ex­hi­bi­tion games from to­day as prepa­ra­tions enter the fi­nal phase.</p>
    <p>Rus­sell West­brook is un­likely to play in the first of Houston’s three scrim­mages, but the Rock­ets are hope­ful he will be in­te­grated this week­end af­ter the guard flew to Or­lando on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The 2017 Most Valu­able Player (MVP) announced last week he had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, but he will be al­lowed to enter the “bub­ble” af­ter he is quar­an­tined for 48 hours and is cleared of the dis­ease in two sep­a­rate tests at least 24 hours apart.</p>
    <p>He must also be cleared by a league-ap­proved in­fec­tious dis­ease physi­cian and un­dergo car­diac screen­ing be­fore he can join his team­mates.</p>
    <p>His coach, Mike D’An­toni, is look­ing for­ward to his re­turn, say­ing West­brook will “give ev­ery­one a lit­tle pep in their step”.</p>
    <p>The iso­lated na­ture of the “bub­ble” has so far worked, but be­ing housed in a con­tained fa­cil­ity has left LeBron James pin­ing for family.</p>
    <p>His mother, Glo­ria, has re­mained in his home­town of Akron, Ohio, while the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers star has been in self-iso­la­tion – first in Los An­ge­les and now in Or­lando.</p>
    <p>“It was the first time I went that long in my life with­out see­ing my mum,” he said. “That was ex­treme for me.</p>
    <p>“Com­ing from a sin­gle par­ent house­hold, be­ing an only child... for me to be away from her that long (was dif­fi­cult). My mum, she kept me sane be­cause she said in due time we’ll join back again.”</p>
    <p>He added that he was un­fazed by news that this year’s Most Valu­able Player award will be de­cided be­fore the league’s restart, claim­ing he had proven him­self in the ul­tra-com­pet­i­tive Western Con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“There was a lot of conversati­on about ‘LeBron can do those things in the East, but if he came to the West, what can he do?’,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I heard all of that. To be able to have our team at the top of the West and play­ing the way we were play­ing at that time and the way I was play­ing, that’s def­i­nitely a good feel­ing.”</p>
