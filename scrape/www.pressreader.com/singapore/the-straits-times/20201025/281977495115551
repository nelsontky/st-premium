    <p>• Lawyers of Bri­tish so­cialite Ghis­laine Maxwell – a cen­tral fig­ure en­twined in the scan­dal in­volv­ing late fi­nancier Jef­frey Ep­stein’s sex­ual abuse of teenage girls – say US pros­e­cu­tors are reneg­ing on a promise to pro­vide her with the ev­i­dence they col­lected in her sex traf­fick­ing case.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment’s fail­ure to pro­vide the ev­i­dence makes it im­pos­si­ble for Maxwell to pre­pare her de­fence, her lawyer Jef­frey Pagli­uca said on Fri­day in a let­ter to US District Judge Ali­son Nathan.</p>
    <p>Maxwell is ac­cused of re­cruit­ing girls as young as 14 to be sex­u­ally abused by Ep­stein, her for­mer boyfriend.</p>
    <p>Ep­stein was charged separately last year with sex traf­fick­ing of un­der­age girls but was found dead in his jail cell in Au­gust last year. The au­thor­i­ties later ruled his death a sui­cide.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Maxwell’s lawyer, her in­dict­ment does not give spe­cific dates for when she com­mit­ted the al­leged crimes, say­ing only that they oc­curred be­tween 1994 and 1997.</p>
    <p>“Nei­ther the in­dict­ment nor the dis­cov­ery i nform Ms Maxwell about crit­i­cal in­for­ma­tion nec­es­sary to pre­pare her de­fence,” Mr Pagli­uca wrote.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause there are no dates pro­vided, other than a three-year pe­riod be­gin­ning 26 years in the past, Ms Maxwell can­not prop­erly in­ves­ti­gate where she and other wit­nesses were when the al­leged crime sup­pos­edly oc­curred.”</p>
    <p>Maxwell has been held in a fed­eral lock-up in Brook­lyn since her ar­rest in July.</p>
    <p>She also claims fed­eral prison of­fi­cials have “ex­ac­er­bated” her lack of ac­cess to ev­i­dence by re­quir­ing her to sit across the ta­ble from her lawyers. That has pre­vented her from re­view­ing ev­i­dence on a lap­top with her at­tor­neys, Mr Pagli­uca said.</p>
    <p>At re­cent hear­ings about con­di­tions at New York’s fed­eral jails dur­ing the pandemic, lawyers for the US Bureau of Prisons said they have had to limit in­mate ac­cess to their coun­sel as well as im­pose so­cial dis­tanc­ing curbs on in­mates to en­sure the health and safety of the de­tainees, lawyers and staff.</p>
    <p>Maxwell said pros­e­cu­tors have given her some ev­i­dence in the case, but she claimed the ma­jor­ity per­tains only to Ep­stein.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tion­ally, while pros­e­cu­tors told Judge Nathan at a hear­ing in July that the strength of their case posed “a strong in­cen­tive” for Maxwell to flee, the gov­ern­ment “has failed to pro­duce any of the cor­rob­o­rat­ing doc­u­men­ta­tion that they claimed to have at the ini­tial hear­ing in this case”, Mr Pagli­uca wrote.</p>
    <p>For years, Maxwell, 58, has been a cen­tral but silent fig­ure in the case in­volv­ing Ep­stein’s his­tory of abus­ing teenage girls.</p>
    <p>She had on Thursday, how­ever, of­fered her fullest re­sponse yet to the swirl of claims sur­round­ing Ep­stein as a four-year-old de­po­si­tion was re­leased.</p>
    <p>In the 418-page de­po­si­tion, Maxwell re­jected ac­cu­sa­tions of wrong­do­ing, de­nied that she had re­cruited mi­nors to give Ep­stein sex­ual mas­sages or that she knew he was abus­ing girls and young women. She also de­nied hav­ing en­gaged in sex­ual acts her­self with un­der­age peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“I can’t think of any­thing I have done that is il­le­gal,” she said.</p>
