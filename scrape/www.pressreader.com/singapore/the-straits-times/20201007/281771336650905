    <p>Uni­ver­sal Stu­dios Sin­ga­pore, Hard Rock Cafe in Re­sorts World Sen­tosa and Ikea Tampines were vis­ited by in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients, said the Health Min­istry yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Su­per­mar­kets such as Gi­ant Hyper­mar­ket in Tampines and newE­con – Top Choice Su­per­mar­ket at 84 Bayshore Road were also added to the list of places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited for at least 30 minutes and the times they vis­ited them, to get peo­ple who were at those places at the same time to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit. The full list of lo­ca­tions and times can be found on the gov.sg web­site. It has said that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and that there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, two new cases in the com­mu­nity were an­nounced yes­ter­day. Nei­ther showed symp­toms when they were tested dur­ing quar­an­tine, and were house­hold con­tacts of two pa­tients pre­vi­ously re­ported separately on Mon­day and Sun­day. One is a seven-year-old male stu­dent at a pri­vate school, while the other, a 42-year-old woman, is a home­maker. The min­istry did not say which school the boy at­tended, but said he was last in school on Sept 18. Both had been placed on quar­an­tine on Satur­day, but had not left home since Sept 28, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>Four im­ported pa­tients were also an­nounced yes­ter­day. They in­clude a boy, 12, who ar­rived from Ja­pan, a girl, 11, from In­dia, a woman, 32, from Nepal, and a woman, 35, from In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said they were all placed on 14-day stay-home no­tice on ar­rival here, and were tested while serv­ing no­tice at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing five of 11 new coro­n­avirus pa­tients an­nounced yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,830.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has in­creased from one case two weeks ago to two in the past week.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of fewer than one case per day over the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>With 15 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,597 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 43 re­mained in hos­pi­tal yes­ter­day, in­clud­ing one in the in­ten­sive care unit, while 148 were re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, two new cases in the com­mu­nity were an­nounced yes­ter­day. Nei­ther showed symp­toms when they were tested dur­ing quar­an­tine, and were house­hold con­tacts of two pa­tients pre­vi­ously re­ported separately on Mon­day and Sun­day.</p>
