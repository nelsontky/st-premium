    <p>WASH­ING­TON • United States biotech­nol­ogy firm Moderna will not seek an emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion (EUA) for its coro­n­avirus vac­cine be­fore Nov 25, its chief ex­ec­u­tive has told the Fi­nan­cial Times.</p>
    <p>The news on Wed­nes­day deals a blow to US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s hopes of hav­ing a vac­cine ready be­fore the elec­tion to give his cam­paign a much-needed boost.</p>
    <p>Mr Stephane Ban­cel told the news­pa­per: “Nov 25 is the time we will have enough safety data to be able to put into an EUA file that we would send to the FDA (Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion), as­sum­ing that the safety data is good – that is, a vac­cine is deemed to be safe.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, whose ap­proval has taken a hit over his han­dling of the Covid-19 cri­sis, has fre­quently hinted a vac­cine could be ready be­fore the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>This has raised concerns among ex­perts that his ad­min­is­tra­tion may at­tempt to in­ter­fere with the reg­u­la­tory process for po­lit­i­cal rea­sons.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent re­peated his claim on Tues­day night, dur­ing a de­bate with his Demo­cratic ri­val Joe Biden.</p>
    <p>“It’s a pos­si­bil­ity that we’ll have the an­swer be­fore Nov 1,” he said.</p>
    <p>Moderna’s vac­cine is one of 11 ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cines in fi­nal stage tri­als. Another is be­ing de­vel­oped by Pfizer, whose CEO Al­bert Bourla has taken the po­si­tion that his com­pany may have a clear an­swer about whether their vac­cine works by this month.</p>
    <p>Most ex­perts are scep­ti­cal of the claim, be­liev­ing that the on­go­ing tri­als will not have suf­fi­cient sta­tis­ti­cal data to prove the drug’s safety and ef­fec­tive­ness by that time.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to the Wash­ing­ton Post on Tues­day, Dr Bourla de­nied he was at­tempt­ing to curry favour with the Pres­i­dent by mak­ing his Oc­to­ber claim. “For me, the elec­tion day is an ar­ti­fi­cial day. The end of Oc­to­ber is an ar­ti­fi­cial day. This is how we op­er­ate. If we can bring (the vac­cine) ear­lier, we will,” he said.</p>
    <p>By re­peat­ing a date that flies in the face of most sci­en­tific pre­dic­tions, Dr Bourla is mak­ing a high-stakes gam­ble. If Pfizer puts out a vac­cine be­fore it has been thor­oughly tested – some­thing the com­pany has pledged it will not do – it could pose a ma­jor threat to pub­lic safety.</p>
    <p>The per­cep­tion mat­ters, too: If Amer­i­cans see the vac­cine as hav­ing been rushed in or­der to pla­cate Mr Trump, many may refuse to get it.</p>
    <p>But there is a sig­nif­i­cant up­side, to the tune of bil­lions of dol­lars, in be­ing first to the US mar­ket with a vac­cine. And stay­ing in Mr Trump’s good graces – par­tic­u­larly when he keeps talk­ing about ways to lower drug prices – might not be a bad thing for a com­pany that brought in nearly US$40 bil­lion (S$54.51 bil­lion) last year from sales of high­priced, brand-name drugs.</p>
    <p>And, given the White House’s per­sis­tent ef­forts to in­ter­fere in the de­ci­sions of fed­eral health agen­cies, some sci­en­tists fear a vac­cine ap­proval could come un­der sim­i­lar pres­sure.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a Pfizer spokesman said that when Dr Bourla re­ferred to a “con­clu­sive read­out” next month, he meant it is pos­si­ble the out­side board of ex­perts mon­i­tor­ing the trial would have by that date found promis­ing signs that the vac­cine works.</p>
    <p>Dr Bourla, who has spent much of the past month giv­ing in­ter­views to me­dia out­lets and ap­pear­ing on in­dus­try pan­els, has in­sisted the com­pany’s ac­cel­er­ated timeline had noth­ing to do with pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>“We have politi­cians or jour­nal­ists speak­ing about ef­fi­cacy or safety about medicines which, of course, is not ap­pro­pri­ate,” Dr Bourla said at the com­pany’s in­vestor day on Sept 15. “The sci­en­tists should be hav­ing these dis­cus­sions.”</p>
    <p>Nov 25 is the time we will have enough safety data to be able to put into an EUA file that we would send to the FDA (Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion), as­sum­ing that the safety data is good – that is, a vac­cine is deemed to be safe.</p>
