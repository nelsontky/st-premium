    <p>MUM­BAI • A song from an up­com­ing Bollywood film has been rewrit­ten after so­cial me­dia users crit­i­cised the orig­i­nal lyrics as racist for glo­ri­fy­ing fair skin and mak­ing an in­ap­pro­pri­ate ref­er­ence to black Amer­i­can pop star Bey­once (above).</p>
    <p>The of­fend­ing lyrics, which trans­lated as “After look­ing at you fair woman, Bey­once would feel shy”, fea­tured in a song from a film called</p>
    <p>Khaali Peeli, whose di­rec­tor Maqbool Khan swiftly apol­o­gised.</p>
    <p>“(The) lyrics in ques­tion were never in­tended racially,” Khan said in a state­ment on Mon­day, adding that the film’s mak­ers were huge fans of Bey­once and had not meant any dis­re­spect.</p>
    <p>“The term ‘goriya’ (fair woman in Hindi) has been so often and tra­di­tion­ally used in In­dian songs to ad­dress a girl, that it didn’t oc­cur to any of us to in­ter­pret it in a lit­eral man­ner,” he added.</p>
    <p>A new ver­sion of the song, which drops the con­tro­ver­sial line, is avail­able on mu­sic-stream­ing ap­pli­ca­tions, a spokesman for the film said.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s film in­dus­try is often ac­cused of feed­ing the coun­try’s ob­ses­sion with fair skin and bias against darker faces and the is­sue drew in­creased scru­tiny dur­ing the Black Lives Mat­ter protests ear­lier this year when Bollywood ac­tors spoke out against racism.</p>
    <p>Cam­paign­ers wel­comed the crit­i­cism on Twit­ter over the song’s lyrics. They said it was a rare chal­lenge to Bollywood song lyrics and di­a­logues equat­ing fair­ness with beauty that showed greater aware­ness of dis­crim­i­na­tion.</p>
