    <p>• Bil­lion­aire Jack Ma’s Ant Group plans to file for dual list­ings in Hong Kong and Shang­hai in the next few weeks, tar­get­ing a val­u­a­tion of about US$225 bil­lion (S$307.9 bil­lion) in an ef­fort to pull off the world’s largest ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO), peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter said.</p>
    <p>The share sale could raise about US$30 bil­lion in to­tal if mar­kets are favourable, said one of the sources, re­quest­ing not to be named be­cause the mat­ter is pri­vate. The Hangzhou-based com­pany seeks to float its shares si­mul­ta­ne­ously on the Hong Kong stock ex­change and the tech-fo­cused Star board in Shang­hai as soon as Oc­to­ber, the sources said.</p>
    <p>A US$30 bil­lion dual list­ing could mark the big­gest de­but glob­ally, top­ping Saudi Aramco’s record US$29.4 bil­lion haul, ac­cord­ing to data com­piled by Bloomberg. At a val­u­a­tion of US$225 bil­lion, Ant’s val­u­a­tion would be big­ger than those of Gold­man Sachs Group and Mor­gan Stan­ley com­bined.</p>
    <p>Ant’s plans, in­clud­ing de­tails of the share sale, are sub­ject to change, the sources said.</p>
    <p>A rep­re­sen­ta­tive for Ant de­clined to com­ment. Ant, which made about US$1.3 bil­lion in profit in the March quar­ter, is Alibaba Group Hold­ing founder Ma’s prized as­set. It has mor­phed from a fin­tech plat­form to an on­line mall for ev­ery­thing from loans and travel ser­vices to food de­liv­ery, in a bid to win back shop­pers lost to Ten­cent Hold­ings.</p>
    <p>With data from al­most a bil­lion users of its Ali­pay app at its back, Ant is push­ing broadly into fi­nan­cial ser­vices, de­liv­er­ing tech­nol­ogy such as robo-in­vest­ing and lend­ing plat­forms, as well as build­ing out its ad­vi­sory busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Ant’s IPO will give an­other boost to Hong Kong Ex­changes and Clear­ing, which has al­ready seen a re­nais­sance of Chi­nese tech list­ings af­ter it re­laxed rules in the wake of los­ing China’s big­gest tech firms to New York. Alibaba, which owns a third of Ant, re­turned with a US$13 bil­lion se­condary list­ing last year in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>China’s ef­fort to build its own tech bourse in Shang­hai un­der­scores the geopo­lit­i­cal ten­sion with Wash­ing­ton. A high-pow­ered group of United States reg­u­la­tors said this month that stock ex­changes should set new rules that could trig­ger the delist­ing of Chi­nese busi­nesses. Com­pa­nies must grant Amer­i­can reg­u­la­tors ac­cess to their au­dit work pa­pers to trade on a US ex­change, ac­cord­ing to the Pres­i­dent’s Work­ing Group on Fi­nan­cial Mar­kets.</p>
    <p>The rec­om­men­da­tions tar­get a prob­lem that has vexed US reg­u­la­tors for more than a decade: China’s re­fusal to al­low in­spec­tors from the Pub­lic Com­pany Ac­count­ing Over­sight Board to re­view au­dits of com­pa­nies that trade on Amer­i­can mar­kets. A high-pro­file ac­count­ing scan­dal at Luckin Cof­fee this year has also el­e­vated such con­cerns.</p>
