    <p>Q What has been your big­gest in­vest­ing mis­take?</p>
    <p>A I started play­ing in the stock mar­ket just be­fore the tech bub­ble burst in the late 1990s, and I got greedy over a size­able spec­u­la­tive sin­gle stock po­si­tion that went from be­ing up 400 per cent to essen­tially $0. It was ap­prox­i­mately 30 per cent of my sav­ings at that time, so it hurt.</p>
    <p>Key lessons learnt were not to be greedy and have a ba­sis for why you in­vest and buy or sell a stock that is fact-based, driven on fun­da­men­tals and not emo­tion­ally driven.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, never put all your eggs in one bas­ket. The com­pany was an Aus­tralian tech firm called Voicenet and it was be­ing driven up purely on spec­u­la­tion in share fo­rums.</p>
    <p>A fact-based in­vest­ment is one that is an­chored in both quan­ti­ta­tive data – that is, fi­nan­cials, cus­tomers, mar­ket size and trac­tion – and also in qual­i­ta­tive as­sess­ments such as com­pet­i­tive po­si­tion, man­age­ment team and value propo­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Q And your best in­vest­ment?</p>
    <p>A Gong Cha will al­ways be an in­vest­ment that is ex­tremely hard to repli­cate, although we are try­ing to do so.</p>
    <p>In 2011, I came across Gong Cha in VivoCity and was fas­ci­nated by the num­ber of peo­ple queue­ing up in what was a small-for­mat store with low cap­i­tal ex­pen­di­ture, for a drink that is largely wa­ter, tapi­oca and tea leaves, which of­fered good mar­gins.</p>
    <p>I stud­ied the busi­ness for about three months be­fore de­cid­ing to fly to Tai­wan to pitch for the mas­ter fran­chise for the Korean mar­ket and, in turn, give up a lu­cra­tive ca­reer in bank­ing.</p>
    <p>In terms of per­sonal in­vest­ment, my best bet is prob­a­bly Tesla. Lever­ag­ing my ex­pe­ri­ence gained from in­vest­ing in earlystage tech com­pa­nies, I could sense that what they were do­ing was game-chang­ing and with a founder like Elon Musk, it ticked all the boxes in terms of be­ing a po­ten­tial game changer.</p>
    <p>I bought the stock at around US$200 (S$274) in 2017 and have hap­pily seen it hit US$1,000. The most pleas­ing as­pect of it is not the re­turn, but see­ing a highly tal­ented en­tre­pre­neur prove so many peo­ple wrong.</p>
