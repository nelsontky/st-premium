    <p>Dressed in brightly coloured sports­wear and pon­chos, 103 vol­un­teers and par­tic­i­pants braved yes­ter­day’s down­pour in the fi­nale of Ruck-On! Sin­ga­pore!, a char­ity event where par­tic­i­pants walked across Sin­ga­pore’s cen­tral district.</p>
    <p>It was the last of five “ruck­ing” events that took place over the past month, at­tract­ing about 380 par­tic­i­pants in all. Ruck­ing refers to walk­ing with a ruck­sack loaded with weights to build strength.</p>
    <p>Su­per­mar­ket chain FairPrice had pledged to do­nate one bowl each of white rice, brown rice and oats to needy fam­i­lies in the South East Com­mu­nity De­vel­op­ment Coun­cil area for ev­ery 300m walked by par­tic­i­pants. The par­tic­i­pants cov­ered about 4,000km over five walks, and around 40,000 bowls of grain will be do­nated. The walks were open to the public.</p>
    <p>Ruck-On! Sin­ga­pore! was or­gan­ised by To­geth­erPilots SG – a group formed last Au­gust to or­gan­ise ac­tiv­i­ties for air­line staff to help them cope with the lack of work and the un­cer­tainty fac­ing the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng Chee Meng, sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the Na­tional Trades Union</p>
    <p>Congress, j oined in yes­ter­day’s 7km walk from New­ton to Spruce restau­rant in Tan­glin, one of three dif­fer­ent routes that par­tic­i­pants could choose to cover.</p>
    <p>“It’s re­ally good to see our pi­lots start­ing a mi­cro-com­mu­nity to take care of one an­other, and their good work spread­ing to other com­mu­ni­ties,” he said.</p>
    <p>To­geth­erPilots SG co-founder and pi­lot An­war Salim, 49, said: “Go­ing out­side and get­ting some ex­er­cise... may not di­rectly solve the problems peo­ple may be fac­ing, but it can lift their spir­its.”</p>
    <p>What be­gan as an in­for­mal sup­port sys­tem within the avi­a­tion com­mu­nity has since ex­panded to in­clude mem­bers of the public, as the or­gan­is­ers would like to foster a sense of na­tion­wide sol­i­dar­ity.</p>
    <p>Ad­min­is­tra­tive ex­ec­u­tive June Low, 53, who par­tic­i­pated in all five walks, said: “(My fam­ily) started walk­ing be­cause of the cir­cuit breaker and I think it’s re­ally nice to be able to do it for a good cause – it makes it more mean­ing­ful.”</p>
