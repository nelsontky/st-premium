    <p>More men are seek­ing help for in­fer­til­ity. The Na­tional Uni­ver­sity Hos­pi­tal (NUH) has seen an 80 per cent in­crease over the last three years, from about 150 pa­tients in 2016 to about 270 last year, says Dr Joe Lee, a senior con­sul­tant at the Depart­ment of Urol­ogy there.</p>
    <p>He stresses, though, that this “does not mean that there is an in­crease in the preva­lence of in­fer­til­ity in the pop­u­la­tion”.</p>
    <p>Some of the more com­mon causes in­clude ex­ter­nal reasons such as smok­ing, ex­ces­sive alcohol con­sump­tion and stress.</p>
    <p>Even sit­ting for long hours, wear­ing tight cloth­ing or work­ing on a lap­top for a pro­longed pe­riod can re­duce sperm pro­duc­tion, he cau­tions.</p>
    <p>Other reasons in­clude is­sues in the testes, which can range from sex­u­ally trans­mit­ted dis­eases to en­larged veins and ge­netic de­fects. Low sperm motil­ity, where there are in­suf­fi­cient healthy sperm to fer­tilise the egg, is also “very com­mon” in men with in­fer­til­ity and usu­ally oc­curs with other is­sues such as low sperm count or a low num­ber of nor­mally shaped sperm, Dr Lee adds.</p>
    <p>Another rea­son for the higher num­ber of cases is greater aware­ness. Dr Ann Tan, med­i­cal di­rec­tor of Vir­tus Fer­til­ity Centre, a pri­vate fer­til­ity clinic, says: “It’s only re­cently that cou­ples have started talk­ing more about male in­fer­til­ity at an in­ter­na­tional level; it has been an in­creas­ingly recog­nised con­di­tion and much re­search is going into this area too.</p>
    <p>“For too long now, the over­all bur­den of in­fer­til­ity has fallen on women. So it’s im­por­tant we see the cou­ple.”</p>
    <p>The global de­cline in sperm count (see main story) has been at­trib­uted to di­etary and life­style changes as­so­ci­ated with modern life and greater ex­po­sure to en­vi­ron­men­tal tox­ins.</p>
    <p>Lo­cally, the trend of de­lay­ing mar­riage is also a con­tribut­ing fac­tor in male in­fer­til­ity is­sues, Dr Lee ex­plains.</p>
    <p>As cou­ples marry and have chil­dren later, more are look­ing to in-vitro fer­til­i­sa­tion (IVF) as the an­swer.</p>
    <p>Dr Stephen Chew, head of the Di­vi­sion of Re­pro­duc­tive Medicine at NUH, says IVF cases in­crease by 2 to 5 per cent an­nu­ally.</p>
    <p>Di­min­ished ovar­ian re­serve, which refers to a loss in the qual­ity and quan­tity of eggs, usu­ally oc­curs in women over 40, although some may see it in their late 30s.</p>
    <p>Dr Chew ad­vises cou­ples be­low the age of 35 to start try­ing for a baby ear­lier, as most in that age group will not need fer­til­ity treat­ments.</p>
    <p>It is also a good idea to be in “op­ti­mal health before try­ing to con­ceive”, Dr Tan adds.</p>
    <p>Fer­til­ity tests are not a must, but for those with a smaller window of op­por­tu­nity, they may help. Costs vary according to individual needs, but a semen anal­y­sis is $75 to $110 at NUH. Vir­tus Fer­til­ity Centre charges about $200 for a semen anal­y­sis for the man to­gether with an an­tiMul­le­rian hor­mone test to as­sess a woman’s egg count.</p>
    <p>Dr Lee adds: “Fer­til­ity is time-sen­si­tive, so if fac­tors which can sig­nif­i­cantly re­duce the suc­cess of nat­u­ral con­cep­tion are present, dis­cov­er­ing them early will help cou­ples avoid los­ing out on too much time.”</p>
