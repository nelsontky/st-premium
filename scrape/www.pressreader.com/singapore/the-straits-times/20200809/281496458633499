    <p>Sticks. Pens. Tow­els. Foam blocks. These are the ev­ery­day tools at the dis­posal of fit­ness train­ers to help cor­rect or ad­just a client’s form if ver­bal in­struc­tions are in­suf­fi­cient.</p>
    <p>Di­rect phys­i­cal con­tact with the trainee should never be the de­fault, and if it is ab­so­lutely nec­es­sary, get­ting con­sent is im­per­a­tive.</p>
    <p>This is the golden rule in a pro­fes­sional re­la­tion­ship be­tween trainer and stu­dent, in­dus­try ex­perts told The Sun­day Times af­ter two re­cent, sep­a­rate in­ci­dents emerged in which a yoga in­struc­tor and a per­sonal trainer were al­leged to have touched their trainees in­ap­pro­pri­ately.</p>
    <p>On Aug 3, a video sur­faced online of a male free­lance per­sonal trainer touch­ing his fe­male client’s but­tocks sev­eral times dur­ing a work­out ses­sion.</p>
    <p>The man was banned from Apeiro Per­for­mance i n Prin­sep Street, where the ses­sion took place, with ef­fect from Aug 2. The man de­fended him­self on Aug 5, say­ing the client did not raise any ob­jec­tions and had con­sented to the phys­i­cal con­tact.</p>
    <p>Days ear­lier, in tweets that have since been made pri­vate, a former stu­dent of a yoga cen­tre ac­cused an in­struc­tor of mo­lest­ing her dur­ing a class on July 11. She said in her posts that she had made a po­lice re­port and was seek­ing le­gal ad­vice.</p>
    <p>To avoid such un­pleas­ant episodes, it is im­per­a­tive that train­ers be very clear when seek­ing ap­proval to place their hands on clients.</p>
    <p>Mr Chung Tze Khit, 34, who con­ducts cour­ses cer­ti­fy­ing per­sonal train­ers, said: “Don’t touch other peo­ple’s but­tocks. I con­duct cour­ses every month, and I al­ways tell (the as­pir­ing per­sonal train­ers) to ask for per­mis­sion. Don’t touch sen­si­tive body parts.</p>
    <p>“There are in­stances where touch­ing clients ap­pro­pri­ately is use­ful for train­ing, but it helps only at the right places and right time, so ask for per­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>“If per­mis­sion is given and you pro­ceed and the client is not com­fort­able, stop it im­me­di­ately.”</p>
    <p>Ms Koh Xin Yun, 26, a sales sup­port spe­cial­ist, has been work­ing with a male trainer for the past year. She said: “My first two train­ers were fe­male, but I don’t re­mem­ber them touch­ing me. My cur­rent trainer has never touched me. He ver­bally tells me where I should feel (the mus­cle en­gage­ment) and how I should ad­just my pos­ture.</p>
    <p>“Even when do­ing dead lifts, or squats on the squat rack, he would tell me how (my glutes) should feel, or he would ask where I feel the mus­cle en­gage­ment, and af­ter I tell him, he will tell me if it’s the right part or not.</p>
    <p>“If it’s not, he would say maybe you should widen your knees to work the cor­rect mus­cles.”</p>
    <p>At The Brave Shapes in Robin­son Road, the bou­tique gym’s team of four train­ers use 1m light plas­tic sticks to guide clients in form correction. Aug­mented re­al­ity tech­nol­ogy is used to demon­strate ex­er­cises.</p>
    <p>Chief trainer and di­rec­tor Evans</p>
    <p>Wu said the ma­jor­ity of his gym’s clients are women, and per­mis­sion is re­quired from clients, re­gard­less of their sex, if a trainer needs to touch them. If a trainer and client are of dif­fer­ent sexes, the coach­ing stick must be used.</p>
    <p>“Any­thing with re­gard to form correction has to be done within the main area of the stu­dio, where there are no CCTV blind spots,” added Mr Wu, 31.</p>
    <p>Us­ing props is a com­mon prac­tice in many gyms. Fit­ness First’s na­tional per­sonal train­ing man­ager Cris Chong, 33, said: “Should a need arise to cor­rect the client’s form with phys­i­cal con­tact, train­ers will first ask for con­sent and use a pen to in­di­cate parts of the body that their stu­dents need to fo­cus on or be aware of.”</p>
    <p>Since they were al­lowed to re­open af­ter the cir­cuit breaker, the True Group, which has 10 True Fit­ness and TFX gyms is­land­wide, has barred its train­ers from any phys­i­cal con­tact with their clients. All correction and teach­ing are to be done via ver­bal cues.</p>
    <p>True Group’s di­rec­tor Sean Tan said that be­fore the cir­cuit breaker, their train­ers would use a towel when as­sist­ing with stretch­ing. He said: “In the event that there (was) a need to cor­rect pos­ture, train­ers (would be) ex­pected to touch only the joint area (for ex­am­ple – hip, kneecaps, an­kle or shoul­der joints) and use only two fin­gers to do so.”</p>
    <p>Yoga in­struc­tor Raphael Revin­dran, 25, said if ver­bal cues do not work, an al­ter­na­tive is us­ing an­other stu­dent in the class who is per­form­ing the move cor­rectly as a ref­er­ence. “If that fails, the teacher... should demon­strate while bring­ing at­ten­tion to the crit­i­cal ar­eas,” said Mr Revin­dran, who has been teach­ing yoga for a year.</p>
    <p>In some yoga classes, stu­dents are given the op­tion of dis­play­ing “no ad­just­ment” cards to limit phys­i­cal in­ter­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Revin­dran, who has been teach­ing at Pure Yoga for the past month and has more than 10 ses­sions a week with 12 stu­dents a class, said stu­dents are asked at the start of each class if they ob­ject to be­ing ad­justed.</p>
    <p>“I’ll still ask be­fore mak­ing ad­just­ments, (in­clud­ing) on the more phys­i­cal front, to ask if the stu­dent is com­fort­able or if it’s get­ting too painful,” he said.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­a­tion of Women for Ac­tion and Re­search ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Corinna Lim sug­gested all gyms and yoga stu­dios should have clear guide­lines as part of their in­take process that state when touch is nec­es­sary for any given in­struc­tion, such as to cor­rect pos­ture and form, and on which body part.</p>
    <p>She added: “Ac­count­ing for the in­her­ent power dif­fer­en­tial be­tween in­struc­tor and stu­dent in such set­tings, mech­a­nisms should be in place to as­sure mem­bers that they can re­port in­ap­pro­pri­ate be­hav­iour in a timely, con­fi­den­tial and com­fort­able way.</p>
    <p>“They should not fear that their con­cerns would be made pub­lic, ridiculed or judged in any way.”</p>
    <p>Ac­knowl­edg­ing that some ar­eas of the fit­ness in­dus­try are less reg­u­lated than oth­ers, Ms Lim also rec­om­mended that na­tional agency Sport Sin­ga­pore (SportSG) could lead the way in en­cour­ag­ing all in­sti­tu­tions to im­ple­ment proper poli­cies and re­port­ing pro­ce­dures.</p>
    <p>Mr Azhar Yu­sof, head of CoachSG, said yesterday: “SportSG rec­om­mends that an or­gan­i­sa­tion’s re­cruit­ment process should min­i­mally in­clude a de­tailed and clear job de­scrip­tion, an in­ter­view process, checks on valid coach­ing qual­i­fi­ca­tions and ac­cred­i­ta­tion in­clud­ing first aid, as well as back­ground checks through re­fer­rals and crim­i­nal or dis­ci­plinary record dec­la­ra­tions.”</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to me­dia queries, the po­lice ad­vised vic­tims of mis­con­duct to file a po­lice re­port by speak­ing to of­fi­cers at the near­est Neigh­bour­hood Po­lice Cen­tre, or via the po­lice’s e-ser­vices. They can also call 999 should they re­quire im­me­di­ate as­sis­tance, and their iden­ti­ties will be pro­tected.</p>
    <p>Free­lance per­sonal trainer Ch­eryl Loh, 24, who posted the video of the man touch­ing his stu­dent’s but­tocks, said she did so to raise aware­ness of what con­sti­tutes ap­pro­pri­ate be­hav­iour from in­struc­tors.</p>
    <p>“I wanted both women and men to know that any­thing that causes them to feel un­easy and dis­turbed should al­ways be voiced out. Train­ing and work­ing out should be fun and pro­duc­tive; it’s not sup­posed to make you feel stressed.”</p>
    <p>RIGHT PLACE, RIGHT TIME There are in­stances where touch­ing clients ap­pro­pri­ately is use­ful for train­ing, but it helps only at the right places and right time, so ask for per­mis­sion. ’’ MR CHUNG TZE KHIT, who con­ducts cour­ses cer­ti­fy­ing per­sonal train­ers.</p>
