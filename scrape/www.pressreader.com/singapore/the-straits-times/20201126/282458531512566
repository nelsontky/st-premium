    <p>MODEL PLAYER</p>
    <p>LON­DON Olivier Giroud has pub­licly ex­pressed his wor­ries about his lack of play­ing time this sea­son.</p>
    <p>With the striker yet to start in the Pre­mier League, he is an­gling for a move away from Chelsea when the Jan­uary trans­fer win­dow opens.</p>
    <p>France’s World Cup-win­ning coach Di­dier Deschamps has al­ready said his striker’s lack of min­utes is “con­cern­ing” and Giroud knows his place in the Euro 2020 squad is at risk.</p>
    <p>But with Chelsea set to play 10 games in six weeks, Blues man­ager Frank Lam­pard hopes he can per­suade the 34-year-old to stay at Stam­ford Bridge af­ter claim­ing that more game time was in store for France’s sec­ond-high­est scorer.</p>
    <p>Giroud, who has 44 in­ter­na­tional goals but has made only one start – in the League Cup – this term, came on as a sec­ond-half sub­sti­tute and pow­ered home a header in stop­page time to seal Chelsea’s 2-1 Cham­pi­ons League Group E win at debu­tants Rennes and a place in the knock­out stage on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Hail­ing his striker as a model player that con­tin­ues to get bet­ter with age, Lam­pard said: “Ev­ery­body kind of feels from the out­side what a great pro­fes­sional he is, how highly re­garded he is by his team­mates and my­self.</p>
    <p>“He’s so pro­fes­sional in how he trains and looks af­ter him­self that age isn’t even a fac­tor for him. He’s get­ting bet­ter with age if any­thing, in terms of how he looks af­ter him­self.</p>
    <p>“It wasn’t just his goal when he came on but his hold-up play and phys­i­cal­ity. You saw the re­ac­tion to his goal, and that wasn’t just be­cause it was a late win­ner, it shows what he does day-to-day and what he means to the team.”</p>
    <p>Lam­pard has pre­ferred Timo Werner and Tammy Abra­ham to lead his at­tack and the duo are ex­pected to be fielded ahead of Giroud when lead­ers Tot­ten­ham visit Stam­ford Bridge in the Pre­mier League on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>While Lam­pard will not stand in the for­mer Arse­nal man’s way should he choose to move on in Jan­uary – his con­tract ex­pires next sum­mer – he in­sisted the vet­eran would still have an im­por­tant role to play, even if it mainly in­volves com­ing off the bench.</p>
    <p>“He of­fers a lot for us and I keep say­ing it, but the big sched­ule com­ing up and the way we play means I will rely on play­ers,” he added.</p>
    <p>“Thank­fully for me, he’s a player</p>
    <p>He’s so pro­fes­sional in how he trains and looks af­ter him­self that age isn’t even a fac­tor for him. He’s get­ting bet­ter with age if any­thing, in terms of how he looks af­ter him­self.</p>
    <p>that al­ways keeps the right at­ti­tude if he’s not play­ing reg­u­larly and I know when I call upon him that he comes in as he did to­day.”</p>
    <p>Ser­hou Guirassy had can­celled out a first-half opener by Cal­lum Hud­son-Odoi, but the hosts were de­nied by a string of top saves from their for­mer No. 1 Edouard Mendy, who moved to Chelsea in the sum­mer.</p>
    <p>Join­ing the Blues in the next round are Span­ish La Liga out­fit</p>
    <p>Sevilla, who won 2-1 at Rus­sia’s Krasnodar.</p>
    <p>With both sides on 10 points, they will now do bat­tle for first place come the end of the group stage next month.</p>
    <p>“I’m very happy to qual­ify with two games to spare,” said Lam­pard. “It was a re­ally tough match, they’re (Rennes) a very good team.</p>
    <p>“Their re­cent form doesn’t re­flect how good they are, it was a tough, hard-fought win.”</p>
