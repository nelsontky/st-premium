    <p>The pan­demic has not stopped Man­dopop star JJ Lin from be­ing pro­duc­tive.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean singer­song­writer has been es­pe­cially pro­lific with putting out new mu­sic at the tail end of the year.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, he re­leased Just Jazzin’ (right), his first jazz EP in his 17-year mu­sic ca­reer.</p>
    <p>It com­prises 1930s jazz-style ren­di­tions of two of his songs –</p>
    <p>Prac­tice Love from the 2013 al­bum Sto­ries Un­told, and Lit­tle Big Us from 2017’s Mes­sage In A Bot­tle. “I lis­ten to jazz as much as I lis­ten to pop,” he says, adding that he is pas­sion­ate about mu­sic and movies that came out in the 1930s. “It’s just the whole vibe of emo­tions that you can ex­press through the mu­sic.”</p>
    <p>Just Jazzin’ comes barely two months af­ter he re­leased an­other EP, Drifter, the first of a two-part al­bum. The sec­ond part, his de­but English EP, Like You Do, will be fully re­leased next year.</p>
    <p>Just Jazzin’ is just one of the many firsts he has achieved in the past year.</p>
    <p>Last week saw the re­lease of the song Should’ve Let Go, Lin’s first col­lab­o­ra­tion with Jack­son</p>
    <p>Wang, the Hong Kong rap­persinger-dancer and mem­ber of K-pop boy band Got7.</p>
    <p>They worked on it when Wang was in Sin­ga­pore ear­lier this year .</p>
    <p>The lyrics, Lin says, are based on their mem­o­ries of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Wang, Lin notes, spent a lot of time in Sin­ga­pore when he com­peted in the 2010 Youth Olympics as a fencer.</p>
    <p>In July, Lin re­leased his first col­lab­o­ra­tion with Ja­panese mu­si­cian and street-wear roy­alty Hiroshi Fu­ji­wara, a sin­gle ti­tled No Fil­ter.</p>
    <p>Early last month, there was Em­bark, the Man­darin theme song for an­i­mated film Soul,</p>
    <p>Lin’s first sound­track con­tri­bu­tion to a Pixar film. The song is also found on Drifter.</p>
    <p>Late last month, he put out his first col­lab­o­ra­tion with Amer­i­can elec­tronic dance mu­sic star Steve Aoki, Not Tonight (To­mor­row Sounds Good Steve Aoki Remix).</p>
    <p>It will be in­cluded in Like You Do.</p>
