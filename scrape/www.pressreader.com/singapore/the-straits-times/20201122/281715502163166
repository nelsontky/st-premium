    <p>Five months af­ter Sin­ga­pore moved into phase two of re­open­ing its econ­omy in June, taxi and pri­vate-hire driv­ers con­tinue to spend more time roam­ing the streets with­out pas­sen­gers, with some earn­ing j ust enough to cover costs.</p>
    <p>De­mand for rides re­mains more lack­lus­tre than last year due to the lack of tourists, shut en­ter­tain­ment venues like night­clubs, the ban on the sale of al­co­hol af­ter 10.30pm, and many still work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>There are also fewer in­stances of surge pric­ing for pri­vate-hire driv­ers, mean­ing they have to make more trips to match their pre-Covid-19 earn­ings.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries from The Sun­day Times, the Land Trans­port Author­ity said rid­er­ship in the first week of this month was at 75 per cent of pre-Covid-19 lev­els.</p>
    <p>This fig­ure is on the higher end of es­ti­mates by driv­ers and taxi com­pa­nies, who said rid­er­ship is slightly above 66 per cent of pre-out­break lev­els.</p>
    <p>Taxi driver Shaik Is­mail, 39, said he used to make 13 to 14 trips daily in the past two years, when he drove from 7am to 3pm.</p>
    <p>Now, he strug­gles to get 10 trips de­spite driv­ing an ex­tra two hours, stretch­ing his work day to 5pm. He earns $120 a day now, down from $200 last year.</p>
    <p>Taxi queues are longer now, he said, with many driv­ers choos­ing to wait in line in­stead of driv­ing around aim­lessly with no pas­sen­gers to hail them down.</p>
    <p>The types of trips have also changed, noted Gojek driver Benny Tay, who es­ti­mated that while half of his pas­sen­gers took rides to town in the past, only about 10 per cent do so now.</p>
    <p>The 45-year-old, who has been driv­ing for about two years, said this could be due to many peo­ple still work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>“The shorter rides (be­tween or in heart­land ar­eas) are ob­vi­ously cheaper, so this im­pacts our earn­ings,” he said.</p>
    <p>But Gojek Sin­ga­pore is see­ing hope­ful signs of traf­fic pick­ing up with more of­fice work­ers likely to re­turn to their work­places as the coron­avirus sit­u­a­tion sta­bilises.</p>
    <p>It has noted a 30 per cent in­crease in trips to and from the Cen­tral Busi­ness District since Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Traf­fic to the Ma­rina Bay Fi­nan­cial Cen­tre, OUE Down­town 2, AXA Tower and Guoco Tower has edged up sig­nif­i­cantly, said Gojek, which projects that “we are in a good po­si­tion for growth”.</p>
    <p>Still, driv­ers and com­pa­nies are not ex­pect­ing pre­vail­ing rid­er­ship to change dra­mat­i­cally any time soon. Nightlife, the key to many driv­ers’ i ncome, re­mains sub­dued.</p>
    <p>A Grab spokesman said rides dur­ing this year’s fes­tive sea­son will not be like last year’s, as safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures have put a brake on large-scale cel­e­bra­tions.</p>
    <p>Com­fort DelGro said “de­mand may slowly edge up but the in­crease is not ex­pected to be huge”.</p>
    <p>This spells woe for those used to driv­ing at night, who find it dif­fi­cult to switch to driv­ing in the day af­ter years of ply­ing the night shift.</p>
    <p>“I tried but it’s very dif­fi­cult. It’s very hard for the body to ad­just. Things just look dif­fer­ent in the day, I find it dif­fi­cult to nav­i­gate,” said 57-year-old taxi driver An­thony Tan, who has been driv­ing from 6pm to 6am for the past 12 years.</p>
    <p>He said he used to take home about $100 a day af­ter de­duct­ing fuel and rental ex­penses. He now aver­ages $40 a day.</p>
    <p>“Things are dead af­ter 10.30pm. Some days I think of giv­ing up, but I’m not sure what I’ll do,” he said.</p>
    <p>Gojek driver Ishafizan Buang ex­pressed the same sen­ti­ment.</p>
    <p>“There is barely any­thing at night,” lamented the 41-year-old.</p>
    <p>The father of 11 chil­dren, aged five months to 15 years old, added: “Per­haps you get a ride or two if you hit the right spots like Telok Ayer or Bukit Timah, but the pubs are shut and there are no pas­sen­gers to be picked up at mid­night.”</p>
    <p>The plight of the driv­ers and the sig­nif­i­cant hit the in­dus­try has taken from the pan­demic may not seem ap­par­ent to some com­muters.</p>
    <p>Grad­u­ate stu­dent Jyan Ong said he has not seen a dis­cernible dif­fer­ence in prices or the num­ber of driv­ers on the road.</p>
    <p>Ms Michelle Low, 32, who works in fi­nance, said: “I try to be nice to my driv­ers and en­gage in con­ver­sa­tion with them to brighten their day.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one is hav­ing a hard time now.”</p>
    <p>FORCED TO SWITCH TIMES</p>
    <p>I tried but it’s very dif­fi­cult. It’s very hard for the body to ad­just. Things just look dif­fer­ent in the day, I find it dif­fi­cult to nav­i­gate.’’</p>
    <p>TAXI DRIVER AN­THONY TAN, 57, who has been driv­ing from 6pm to 6am for the past 12 years but has been forced to switch to driv­ing in the day in search of cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>SHORTER TRIPS</p>

    <p>GOJEK DRIVER BENNY TAY, who es­ti­mated that only about 10 per cent of his pas­sen­gers take rides to town now, ver­sus half of them in the past. He said this could be due to many peo­ple still work­ing from home.</p>
