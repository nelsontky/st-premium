    <p>LIKE FA­THER, LIKE SON: Chi­nese cross-talk artist Guo De­gang (left),</p>
    <p>47, who has two sons, sel­dom posts pho­tos taken with his chil­dren on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>But he did so last Fri­day when he posted a photo with his el­der son, Qilin (far left), 24, who is also a cross-talk artist.</p>
    <p>The younger Guo left school in 2011 to pur­sue cross-talk pro­fes­sion­ally, but was heav­ily crit­i­cised for do­ing so. Many doubted he had the tal­ent, but he per­se­vered in cross-talk and has since won over his de­trac­tors.</p>
    <p>He has per­formed with his fa­ther at Deyun­she, a fa­mous Bei­jing cross-talk or­gan­i­sa­tion and folk art per­for­mance group.</p>
    <p>In his Weibo post, the el­der Guo wrote in typ­i­cal cross-talk fash­ion: “I have to raise my son if I want one, and I have to get an em­broi­dered robe my­self if I want one.”</p>
    <p>This was not the first time he has jok­ingly asked his son for a robe. In May, he posted a photo of him­self in a robe, as he wrote: “Son, please think of your dad if you come across a com­pany spon­sor­ing opera clothes.”</p>
    <p>The el­der Guo, who is also a Bei­jing opera ac­tor, is said to have changed up to five robes in a sin­gle show.</p>
    <p>Guo Qilin is his son with his for­mer wife, part-time ac­tress Hu Zhonghui.</p>
    <p>He has a younger son, five-year-old Guo Fenyang, with cur­rent wife, for­mer ac­tress Wang Hui.</p>
