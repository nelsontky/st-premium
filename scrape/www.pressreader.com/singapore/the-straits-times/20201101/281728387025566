    <p>NEW YORK • A record surge of coro­n­avirus cases in the United States pushed hos­pi­tals closer to the brink of ca­pac­ity and drove the num­ber of in­fec­tions re­ported on Fri­day to an omi­nous new daily world record of 100,000, four days be­fore the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The US has sur­passed nine mil­lion to­tal in­fec­tions on Fri­day, rep­re­sent­ing nearly 3 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion, with more than 230,000 dead since the out­break of the pan­demic early this year, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters tally of pub­licly re­ported data.</p>
    <p>With the coun­try fac­ing the fi­nal stretch of a tu­mul­tuous pres­i­den­tial cam­paign dom­i­nated by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the US health au­thor­i­ties on Fri­day con­firmed that 100,233 more peo­ple had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 over the past 24 hours.</p>
    <p>Fri­day’s tally set a new sin­gle­day record in US cases for the fifth time in the past 10 days, sur­pass­ing the pre­vi­ous peak of 91,248 new in­fec­tions posted a day ear­lier. It also rep­re­sented the world’s high­est na­tional daily toll dur­ing the pan­demic, ex­ceed­ing In­dia’s 24-hour record of 97,894 set in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Se­ri­ous cases of Covid-19 were on the rise as well, as hos­pi­tals in six states re­ported hav­ing the most pa­tients suf­fer­ing from the dis­ease since the pan­demic started.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of hos­pi­talised Covid-19 pa­tients has risen over 50 per cent in Oc­to­ber to 46,000, the high­est since mid-Au­gust.</p>
    <p>The Uni­ver­sity of Wash­ing­ton’s newly up­dated model projects the death toll, which had been hold­ing at a monthly pace of just over 22,000 for most of Oc­to­ber, will start climb­ing next month to­wards a new record of more than 72,000 in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>The Jan­uary pro­jec­tion by the uni­ver­sity’s In­sti­tute for Health Met­rics and Eval­u­a­tion would eclipse the nearly 61,000 fa­tal­i­ties in April when the pan­demic first ex­ploded in the US and forced the US Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion (CDC) to ban cruises in US wa­ters in March.</p>
    <p>But the CDC, which has faced in­tense pres­sure by the world’s big­gest cruises lines and the White House to end the ban, said on Fri­day it would lift the ban, even as it said re­cent out­breaks show cruise travel “fa­cil­i­tates and am­pli­fies” Covid-19 trans­mis­sion even at re­duced pas­sen­ger ca­pac­i­ties and poses a risk of fu­elling spread with­out proper over­sight.</p>
    <p>Dr Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown Uni­ver­sity School of Pub­lic Health in Prov­i­dence, Rhode Is­land, said the coun­try lacks ad­e­quate test­ing as the in­fec­tions erupt in dif­fer­ent parts of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>“We are hav­ing some of the largest out­breaks that we’ve had dur­ing the en­tire pan­demic,” Dr Jha told Reuters in an in­ter­view. “And nine, 10 months into this pan­demic, we are still largely not quite pre­pared.”</p>
