    <p>On the sec­ond floor of Or­chard Tow­ers, kitchen crew from dif­fer­ent eater­ies roll out pizza dough, fry chicken wings and as­sem­ble salad bowls.</p>
    <p>Brands such as home-grown burger chain Wolf Burg­ers, chicken wing chain Wing Zone, veg­e­tar­ian meal de­liv­ery brand Sove and Happy End­ing pizza op­er­ate from kitchen spa­ces of be­tween 110 and 220 sq ft.</p>
    <p>They are part of cloud kitchen fa­cil­ity Or­chard Food Mar­ket (www.or­chard­food­mar­ket.com), which houses 18 in­di­vid­ual kitchen spa­ces.</p>
    <p>Run by Smart City Kitchens (SCK), the fa­cil­ity in the back wing of Or­chard Tow­ers along Clay­more Drive opened in April. An­other fa­cil­ity at Cross Street Ex­change (for­merly known as China Square Cen­tral) opens on Oct 15. It is called Cen­tral Food Court and in­cludes a din­ing area.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has three other lo­ca­tions in Tampines, Sem­bawang and Cle­menti – with about 20 to 30 kitchen spa­ces each.</p>
    <p>Ms Arin Ag­haz­ar­ian, SCK’s gen­eral man­ager, is on the look­out for spa­ces to con­tinue ex­pan­sion.</p>
    <p>While cloud or ghost kitchens are not new in Sin­ga­pore, the open­ing of more fa­cil­i­ties has been ac­cel­er­ated by the Covid-19 pan­demic as more peo­ple get used to or­der­ing food de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>Food and bev­er­age (F&B) busi­nesses are ex­pand­ing their reach by set­ting up in these kitchens across the is­land. This also re­duces wait­ing time for cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Some com­pa­nies use cloud kitchens for re­search and de­vel­op­ment, oth­ers to test the mar­ket for new con­cepts.</p>
    <p>The lat­ter has spun off an­other ris­ing trend for vir­tual de­liv­ery-only brands that have no phys­i­cal shop front.</p>
    <p>Be­sides SCK, there are 10 multi­user cloud kitchen fa­cil­i­ties in Sin­ga­pore run by third par­ties such as De­liv­eroo, Foodpanda and GrabFood that are cur­rently or soon to be in op­er­a­tion, says Ms Yeoh Mei Ling, di­rec­tor of the food ser­vices di­vi­sion at En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>She ob­serves that there is in­creased in­ter­est by F&B com­pa­nies to set up and op­er­ate their own cloud kitchens as well.</p>
    <p>“This is a rel­a­tively new busi­ness model and F&B com­pa­nies must take into ac­count ad­di­tional third party ful­fil­ment costs and a rev­enue lim­ited by the de­liv­ery-only model.</p>
    <p>“Nev­er­the­less, if done right, the com­pa­nies can po­ten­tially ex­pand their pres­ence more quickly and in a more cost-ef­fec­tive man­ner via the setup of vir­tual restau­rants in cloud kitchens,” adds Ms Yeoh.</p>
    <p>In­deed, Sin­ga­pore food tech com­pany TiffinLabs will roll out its vir­tual brands across 1,000 kitchens glob­ally in the last quar­ter of this year.</p>
    <p>It is due to open its first few kitchens in the United States soon, fol­lowed by Europe.</p>
    <p>It has more than 12 restau­rant brands made for de­liv­ery, with a new Korean chicken brand in the pipe­line, says TiffinLabs’ co­founder Shaun Smith­son.</p>
    <p>The Da Paolo Group started op­er­at­ing from a cloud kitchen two years ago to widen the reach of its brickand-mor­tar brands Da Paolo Gas­trono­mia and Da Paolo Piz­za­Bar.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, it launched two vir­tual brands – Panini Ital­iani by Da Paolo sell­ing sand­wiches and Da Paolo Pasta Bar sell­ing pasta – and is open­ing its fourth cloud kitchen space in the com­ing week.</p>
    <p>The group’s chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Guillaume Pi­choir, 46, says: “What is im­por­tant is to shorten the path be­tween the kitchen and the cus­tomer’s din­ing ta­ble. You can­not have is­land­wide de­liv­ery from a sin­gle lo­ca­tion and still of­fer qual­ity and speed.”</p>
    <p>On the new brand con­cepts, he adds: “We de­cided to fo­cus on fa­mil­iar prod­ucts be­cause the ex­pe­ri­ence is dif­fer­ent when you or­der on­line – there is no waiter to an­swer your ques­tions about dishes that you are not fa­mil­iar with.”</p>
    <p>One-Miche­lin-starred Ital­ian restau­rant Garibaldi in Purvis Street started its vir­tual brand Bur­rata Joy in May, dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>A month later, it joined De­liv­eroo’s</p>
    <p>Edi­tions cloud kitchen in one-north. Since then, it has rolled out an­other vir­tual brand, Gus­tavo La­pasta, which spe­cialises in pasta dishes.</p>
    <p>Garibaldi’s gen­eral man­ager Wal­ter Vi­si­oli, 30, points out that vir­tual kitchens have an edge over phys­i­cal restau­rants be­cause of low start-up costs and lower risks.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there is a lack of di­rect ac­cess to cus­tomer feed­back.</p>
    <p>Ride-hail­ing com­pany Grab’s newly launched GrabKitche­n in Alju­nied was see­ing in­ter­est from F&B mer­chants who want to park their brands there even be­fore it was ready.</p>
    <p>With more than 20 brands at its first fa­cil­ity in Hil­lview – which launched at the start of this year – it is op­er­at­ing at full ca­pac­ity and sees or­ders grow­ing by about 20 per cent month-on-month, says a Grab spokesman.</p>
    <p>Foodpanda’s Wood­lands cloud kitchen is also fully oc­cu­pied. Its other kitchen in Sims Place was con­verted for gro­cery de­liv­ery ser­vice pan­damart.</p>
    <p>New month-old vir­tual brands at the Wood­lands kitchen in­clude Jack­son’s Fried Chicken, as well as pizza ven­dors in­clud­ing Non­nina’s and Piz­zlah!.</p>
    <p>An up­com­ing vir­tual brand called Holy Zest! will sell cock­tails, says Foodpanda Sin­ga­pore’s oper­a­tions di­rec­tor Jorge Ru­bio.</p>
    <p>With more op­tions avail­able, cloud kitchen op­er­a­tors also ob­serve peo­ple or­der­ing across var­i­ous brands from the same site in a sin­gle or­der.</p>
    <p>De­liv­eroo’s Au­gust Mix and Match menu has seen a year-onyear in­crease of more than three times, says its spokesman.</p>
    <p>It has three Edi­tions sites in Sin­ga­pore with a to­tal of 24 kitchen spa­ces, 18 restau­rant part­ners and 45 brands. A third of the brands are vir­tual restau­rants.</p>
    <p>The So­cial Kitchen, a cloud kitchen op­er­a­tor with a so­cial en­ter­prise model borne from the cir­cuit breaker, is look­ing to have 50 kitchens across Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Its flag­ship launched in Au­gust at the YMCA of Sin­ga­pore and houses nine brands in­clud­ing Ming Fa Fish­ball and Long Black Cafe.</p>
    <p>Un­like other cloud kitchen op­er­a­tors, The So­cial Kitchen cov­ers the kitchen’s rent and man­power. Busi­nesses have to pro­vide only in­gre­di­ents and train­ing for kitchen staff.</p>
    <p>Its co-founder Alvin Yapp, 50, says: “The F&B sec­tor is get­ting used to the con­cept of cloud kitchens and it has be­come a new nor­mal since the pan­demic out­break.</p>
    <p>“The So­cial Kitchen has a unique model be­cause we have our own man­power rather than a land­lord­tenant re­la­tion­ship in most cloud kitchens.”</p>
    <p>Real es­tate agency CBRE’s head of re­search for South-east Asia Des­mond Sim says: “Big name or unique brands can stand out from the pack. Da Paolo’s food, for ex­am­ple, will have its dis­tinct flavour and iden­tity that peo­ple are fa­mil­iar with and more likely to or­der from.”</p>
