    <p>Ja­pan has ac­cused China of uni­lat­er­ally push­ing its ter­ri­to­rial claims in the re­gion, in its an­nual de­fence re­view is­sued yes­ter­day. The 597-page re­port also ac­cused China of spread­ing dis­in­for­ma­tion and pro­pa­ganda in the Covid-19 fight.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan has ac­cused China of uni­lat­er­ally push­ing its ter­ri­to­rial claims in the re­gion and of spread­ing dis­in­for­ma­tion and pro­pa­ganda in the Covid-19 fight.</p>
    <p>Tokyo vowed to “strengthen its de­fence ca­pa­bil­ity at speeds that are fun­da­men­tally dif­fer­ent from the past” in its an­nual de­fence re­view, is­sued yes­ter­day, which also dis­cussed peren­nial se­cu­rity threats, such as North Korea and emer­gent risks in cy­ber and space war­fare.The harsh­est lan­guage in the 597-page re­port was re­served for China, which the re­port said had “re­lent­lessly con­tin­ued uni­lat­eral at­tempts to change the sta­tus quo by co­er­cion” over a dis­puted group of islets in the East China Sea that Ja­pan calls the Senkakus. China calls them the Diaoyus.</p>
    <p>It also ac­cused Bei­jing of “mov­ing for­ward with mil­i­tari­sa­tion, as well as ex­pand­ing and in­ten­si­fy­ing its ac­tiv­i­ties in the mar­itime and ae­rial do­mains” of the South China Sea to “cre­ate a fait ac­com­pli”.</p>
    <p>The pointed crit­i­cism fol­lowed sim­i­lar rhetoric in Wash­ing­ton on Mon­day. US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo de­scribed Chi­nese be­hav­iour in the South China Sea as a</p>
    <p>“cam­paign of bul­ly­ing” to as­sert in­flu­ence in a wa­ter­way where US$3 tril­lion (S$4.2 tril­lion) of global trade passes through each year.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, at a reg­u­lar press brief­ing in Bei­jing, Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian hit back at Ja­pan’s re­port, say­ing it was “full of prej­u­dice and false in­for­ma­tion against China”.</p>
    <p>“It strives to in­cite and dis­in­form against China, paint­ing China as a threat,” Mr Zhao said, adding that Bei­jing has launched stern rep­re­sen­ta­tions to Tokyo.</p>
    <p>“As a re­spon­si­ble ma­jor coun­try,</p>
    <p>China is com­mit­ted to peace­ful de­vel­op­ment and re­gional diplo­macy in that we treat our neigh­bours with kind­ness and as part­ners. We pur­sue a de­fence pol­icy that is de­fen­sive in na­ture. We are a builder and con­trib­u­tor to world peace, sta­bil­ity, and pros­per­ity,” he said.</p>
    <p>Among Ja­pan’s key de­fence projects in the fis­cal year end­ing next March is the con­struc­tion of two de­stroy­ers, a sub­ma­rine and a mine-sweep­ing ves­sel, as well as the pur­chase of three pa­trol air­craft and seven pa­trol he­li­copters.</p>
    <p>These projects are among planned spend­ing that will push the de­fence bud­get up by 1.2 per cent to 5.07 tril­lion yen (S$65.8 bil­lion), though this is still a quar­ter that of China’s, which Tokyo as­serts has been “sus­tained with­out trans­parency over more than 30 years”.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s White Pa­per also pointed the fin­ger at China for try­ing to spread pro­pa­ganda and dis­in­for­ma­tion amid grow­ing un­cer­tainty and con­fu­sion as it pro­vides aid to na­tions fight­ing Covid-19.</p>
    <p>A Ja­panese De­fence Min­istry of­fi­cial, speak­ing to reporters, cited claims in­clud­ing that the coro­n­avirus was brought to China by the US and that Chi­nese herbal reme­dies were ef­fec­tive against it.</p>
    <p>“The Covid-19 pan­demic may ex­pose and in­ten­sify strate­gic com­pe­ti­tion among coun­tries in­tend­ing to cre­ate in­ter­na­tional and re­gional or­ders more prefer­able to them­selves and to ex­pand their in­flu­ence,” the re­port said. “We need to closely watch such moves with great con­cern as se­cu­rity is­sues.”</p>
    <p>Re­act­ing to the re­port, Kobe Univer­sity se­cu­rity ex­pert Tosh Mi­no­hara told The Straits Times that the Quadri­lat­eral Se­cu­rity Di­a­logue, com­pris­ing the US, Ja­pan, Aus­tralia and In­dia, has to be more co­or­di­nated as Bei­jing and Moscow grow closer. He said: “Ja­pan should be push­ing for a more ro­bust Quad, with clearly de­fined aims, as well as a free and open Indo-Pa­cific strat­egy, where the ‘strat­egy’ is em­pha­sised – rather than it be­ing just a mere ‘vi­sion’.”</p>
