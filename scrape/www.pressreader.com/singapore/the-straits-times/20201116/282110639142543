    <p>When his wife was di­ag­nosed with mod­er­ately se­vere young on­set de­men­tia in 2012 at age 55, Mr Nicholas Sim said their world came “crash­ing down”.</p>
    <p>In two years, her con­di­tion de­te­ri­o­rated quickly and she is now in an al­most veg­e­ta­tive state, un­able to move much or speak.</p>
    <p>After her di­ag­no­sis, his wife was very de­pressed, said Mr Sim, 66.</p>
    <p>Once, in the mid­dle of the night, he woke up when he heard her cry­ing. “She said it was be­cause she was afraid that one day she may for­get about me,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Sim said he be­lieves his wife still recog­nises him now, though she is not able to com­mu­ni­cate with him.</p>
    <p>He is home most of the time, after clos­ing down his ex­ec­u­tive search and hu­man re­sources train­ing busi­nesses in 2015 to bet­ter care for her. He now does free­lance hu­man re­source man­age­ment con­sult­ing and train­ing, which gives him more flex­i­bil­ity with his work hours.</p>
    <p>He has a do­mes­tic helper Ch­eryl – a “first-class home man­ager” – who helps care for his wife, such as feed­ing and bathing her. Feed­ing can take up to two hours, as she will sneeze in­ter­mit­tently.</p>
    <p>“I used to bathe her, be­cause I wanted to pro­tect her dig­nity, but now that I’m older, it is too stren­u­ous, and I worry that if I fall, then she will fall,” said Mr Sim.</p>
    <p>He added that he did not want to place his wife in a nurs­ing home, and is pre­pared to take care of her for as long as he has to.</p>
    <p>He has also re­jected the idea of a hospi­tal bed that some have sug­gested, as he wants to sleep in the same bed as her to be by her side, he said.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple have two sons, aged 24 and 27, who live with them in their five-room Hous­ing Board flat in Sengkang.</p>
    <p>Once a week since 2015, Mr Sim takes his wife to Care Li­brary, a pro­gramme by Care Com­mu­nity Ser­vices So­ci­ety that pro­vides ther­apy for de­men­tia pa­tients.</p>
    <p>His wife en­joys the mu­sic hour there, he said.</p>
    <p>But the stress of care­giv­ing does take a toll, as he feels he has to put up a strong front when he is with his wife – to keep her spir­its up even though she is not lu­cid.</p>
    <p>To cope, he finds strength in his faith, as well as in his work, which he loves. “I hope my story en­cour­ages other care­givers to keep go­ing. It’s been eight years and it was and still is not easy,” said Mr Sim. “It is a learn­ing jour­ney to be a care­giver. In a sit­u­a­tion like that, don’t ask why, ask what, and ev­ery day, just do the best that you can do.”</p>
    <p>For his strength, re­silience, and un­wa­ver­ing ded­i­ca­tion in car­ing for his wife, he re­ceived the Sin­ga­pore Pa­tient Care­giver Award ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>But to Mr Sim, the award is not a recog­ni­tion for him­self. “It is in hon­our of, and rep­re­sents all care­givers, and also helps other new care­givers stay pos­i­tive.”</p>
