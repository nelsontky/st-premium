    <p>World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) di­rec­tor-gen­eral Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus is­sued an ap­po­site warn­ing to na­tions that it would be im­pos­si­ble to re­build the global econ­omy with­out vac­ci­nat­ing the planet’s high­est-risk pop­u­la­tions si­mul­ta­ne­ously. His view was that the fastest way to end the pan­demic and re­open economies is to start by pro­tect­ing the high­est-risk pop­u­la­tions ev­ery­where, rather than the en­tire pop­u­la­tions of just some coun­tries. Ide­ally, a vac­cine would be avail­able for all at one go. But that would be a lo­gis­ti­cal im­pos­si­bil­ity. In the event, the WHO chief has made the im­por­tant point: That those at high­est risk – front-line work­ers in health and so­cial care set­tings who come into con­tact with par­tic­u­larly vul­ner­a­ble groups and are es­sen­tial to pro­tect­ing the pop­u­la­tion – must be con­sid­ered to be a sin­gle in­ter­na­tional cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>Na­tions must ab­jure the nat­u­ral temp­ta­tion to vac­ci­nate all or most of their pop­u­la­tions at the ex­pense of those high­est-risk groups else­where. For ex­am­ple, Aus­tralia’s deal with Bri­tish drug­maker As­traZeneca, to pro­duce and dis­trib­ute enough doses of a po­ten­tial vac­cine for its pop­u­la­tion of 25 mil­lion, is un­der­stand­able from a na­tional point of view. But it might not ad­vance the coun­try’s in­ter­na­tional eco­nomic in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>A study pub­lished in the Har­vard Busi­ness Re­view draws at­ten­tion to the dan­gers of vac­cine na­tion­al­ism, the per­haps nat­u­ral but ul­ti­mately short-sighted temp­ta­tion for wealthy coun­tries, in par­tic­u­lar, to pri­ori­tise do­mes­tic mar­kets and hoard vac­cines be­cause they have the means to do so. Vac­cine na­tion­al­ism is not only “morally rep­re­hen­si­ble”, but is also the wrong way to re­duce trans­mis­sion glob­ally, the study notes. Global trans­mis­sion mat­ters be­cause Covid-19 will con­tinue to dis­rupt sup­ply chains and thus economies if some pan­demic-stricken coun­tries have im­peded ac­cess to vac­cines. In­deed, this should be a les­son al­ready learnt, given how na­tion­al­ism ex­ac­er­bated the pan­demic in its early days be­cause of hoard­ing by some coun­tries that led to short­ages of pro­tec­tive gear. Hence the ur­gency of the WHO’s outreach to every coun­try, urg­ing them to join its global shared vac­cine pro­gramme quickly.</p>
    <p>The global health agency has spelled out as well who will get its even­tual coro­n­avirus jabs first. Nine of the 29 vac­cines be­ing tested on hu­mans cur­rently form part of the Co­vax Global Vac­cines Fa­cil­ity. Just over 90 coun­tries are signed up to Co­vax, while an­other 80 have ex­pressed in­ter­est but have yet to com­mit them­selves to the pro­gramme. They should act soon. There are times when in­ter­na­tion­al­ism is the only re­al­is­tic form of na­tion­al­ism. Covid-19 re­in­forces that point in a world that is glob­alised be­yond epi­demi­o­log­i­cal bor­ders. Coun­tries need to act in con­cert against the coro­n­avi­ral scourge.</p>
