    <p>Mr Jamie Mel­drum, former DJ and senior pro­gramme di­rec­tor at Kiss92 FM and One FM 91.3, has died at the age of 50.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings (SPH) Ra­dio said he died as a re­sult of nat­u­ral causes.</p>
    <p>It added that he leaves be­hind his wife Sarocha Mel­drum and three chil­dren – Kat (Rat­tikan), Peter (Ka­malas) and Christo­pher Mel­drum – as well as par­ents Ross and Chris­tine Mel­drum and sis­ters Melissa Hen­der­son and Melinda Reid.</p>
    <p>A Kiss92 post yes­ter­day on Face­book said: “To many of us at SPH Ra­dio, Jamie has been more than a man­ager, more than a col­league. He was a friend, a men­tor who has meant so much to many of us.</p>
    <p>“The weight of los­ing some­one so in­flu­en­tial in our lives is in­de­scrib­able.</p>
    <p>“While we may never be the same with his pass­ing, we will hon­our his legacy with ev­ery minute the ra­dio is on.”</p>
    <p>The Queens­land-born Mr Mel­drum was also the cre­ative head at the sta­tions and he fre­quently did lo­cal and re­gional voice-over work for an­i­ma­tions and com­mer­cials.</p>
    <p>After grad­u­at­ing from the Aus­tralian In­sti­tute of Ra­dio & Tele­vi­sion in 1986, he worked at Sony Mu­sic and as a night­club DJ be­fore mov­ing to ra­dio sta­tions in Syd­ney and Bris­bane.</p>
    <p>He also dab­bled in host­ing tele­vi­sion shows.</p>
    <p>He ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore in 1998, co-host­ing Class 95 FM’s toprated break­fast show, The Morn­ing Ex­press, with Pet­rina Kow and “Fly­ing Dutch­man” Mark van Cuylen­burg in 1999 and 2000. He joined SPH Ra­dio in 2006.</p>
    <p>Kiss92 DJs weighed in on the loss with posts on Face­book.</p>
    <p>De­siree Lai, who helms the sta­tion’s week­end night shows, wrote: “To my dear boss, col­league and friend, please rest well.”</p>
    <p>“Rest In Peace Jamie R Mel­drum. No doubt you’re off to rock that big mi­cro­phone in the sky!”, wrote Tim Oh, who hosts week­day evening shows.</p>
    <p>Joshua Si­mon, who hosts week­night shows on the sta­tion, said he re­mem­bered Mr Mel­drum as a men­tor and the man who gave him his start in ra­dio nine years ago.</p>
    <p>“More than a boss, he has been a friend, send­ing me song rec­om­men­da­tions of 90s club hits from when he would DJ back in the day,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>“When (my sin­gle) All I Wanna Do came out, he cham­pi­oned it, sent it to his in­dus­try peers around the world, and put it on air – he didn’t have to do that, he chose to.</p>
    <p>“He has al­ways cho­sen to do and be more. The man’s larger than life.”</p>
    <p>Si­mon added: “It is a rare priv­i­lege to find that your cheer­leader in the me­dia in­dus­try is your boss. He was a great man and I will miss him dearly.”</p>
