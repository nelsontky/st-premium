    <p>• A Hong Kong dis­trict court yes­ter­day found a cou­ple not guilty of ri­ot­ing dur­ing last year’s pro-democ­racy protests, in a rul­ing that could see hun­dreds of oth­ers avoid jail time.</p>
    <p>More than 9,000 peo­ple were ar­rested dur­ing months of huge and some­times vi­o­lent protests in the fi­nan­cial hub, ini­tially sparked by a now-aban­doned plan to al­low ex­tra­di­tions to the Chi­nese main­land.</p>
    <p>Mr Henry Tong and Ms Elaine To were charged with ri­ot­ing and faced up to seven years in prison af­ter they were de­tained by po­lice last July.</p>
    <p>But the court found there was no ev­i­dence to prove the pair were par­tic­i­pat­ing in that day’s protest.</p>
    <p>Pre­sid­ing Judge An­thony Kwok said it was un­rea­son­able to as­sume the duo had joined the demon­stra­tion just be­cause they were wear­ing dark out­fits sim­i­lar to those sported by the pro­test­ers.</p>
    <p>“As for black cloth­ing, that’s the day-to-day out­fit of many res­i­dents,” the judge added.</p>
    <p>Sup­port­ers ap­plauded and the cou­ple burst into tears when the ver­dict was read. “We won’t cel­e­brate be­cause there are many peo­ple yet to have a fair ver­dict. We hope to cel­e­brate with ev­ery­one else when all of us have got a fair rul­ing,” Mr Tong told me­dia out­side the court.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong and Ms To were re­leased on bail in Au­gust and went ahead with their planned wed­ding while await­ing their court ap­pear­ance.</p>
    <p>Their case sets a prece­dent that could make it harder for the pros­e­cu­tion to se­cure con­vic­tions against some of the 600 or so oth­ers charged with ri­ot­ing dur­ing last year’s pro-democ­racy ral­lies.</p>
    <p>The demon­stra­tions raged for more than seven months and saw rou­tine clashes be­tween po­lice and pro­test­ers con­cerned about the ero­sion of the city’s unique free­doms by main­land Chi­nese rule.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing re­sponded last month by im­pos­ing a sweep­ing na­tional se­cu­rity law that tight­ens re­stric­tions on dis­sent and sub­ver­sion and im­poses harsher penal­ties, in­clud­ing life im­pris­on­ment for the most se­ri­ous of­fences.</p>
