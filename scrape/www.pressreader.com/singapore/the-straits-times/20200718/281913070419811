    <p>• A top White House ad­viser said on Thurs­day that he ex­pects TikTok to sep­a­rate from its Chi­nese owner and op­er­ate as an Amer­i­can com­pany amid grow­ing US con­cerns about the se­cu­rity of the data han­dled by the pop­u­lar short-video app.</p>
    <p>White House eco­nomic ad­viser Larry Kud­low told re­porters that a move by TikTok to leave its par­ent com­pany, China-based ByteDance, would be a bet­ter op­tion than ban­ning the plat­form, which Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo threat­ened to do ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>“We haven’t made fi­nal de­ci­sions (on the ban) but as has been re­ported in some places, I think TikTok is go­ing to pull out of the hold­ing com­pany which is China-run and op­er­ate as an in­de­pen­dent com­pany,” Mr Kud­low told re­porters.</p>
    <p>He did not spec­ify whether TikTok’s own­er­ship would change un­der the pro­posed struc­ture; nei­ther did he com­ment on whether US com­pa­nies could ac­quire TikTok.</p>
    <p>When asked about Mr Kud­low’s re­marks, a TikTok spokesman said the com­pany would not “en­gage with spec­u­la­tion in the mar­ket”, and re­ferred to a state­ment last week not­ing that ByteDance was “eval­u­at­ing changes to the cor­po­rate struc­ture of its TikTok busi­ness” and was fully com­mit­ted to pro­tect­ing users’ pri­vacy and se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Mr Kud­low’s com­ments come as TikTok finds it­self in­creas­ingly in the cross hairs of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, with US-China re­la­tions strained by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and Bei­jing’s move to curb free­doms in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s chief of staff said on Wed­nes­day that the ad­min­is­tra­tion is study­ing the na­tional se­cu­rity risks of so­cial me­dia ap­pli­ca­tions, in­clud­ing TikTok and WeChat, with ac­tion to ad­dress the is­sue ex­pected in the com­ing weeks.</p>
    <p>TikTok is es­ti­mated to have close to a bil­lion users world­wide, and has long bat­tled al­le­ga­tions that it is a spy­ing tool for Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has con­sis­tently de­nied such al­le­ga­tions by point­ing out that it has an Amer­i­can CEO.</p>
    <p>It also de­nied that it shares user data.</p>
    <p>Last week, Mr Trump threat­ened to ban TikTok as a way to pun­ish China for the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Pres­i­dent also fell vic­tim to TikTok users who, along with le­gions of K-pop fans, claimed to have sab­o­taged his cam­paign rally last month in Tulsa, Ok­la­homa, by re­serv­ing blocks of tick­ets for the event that they had no in­ten­tion of at­tend­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s cam­paign boasted that it had re­ceived a mil­lion ticket re­quests, but only 6,200 peo­ple at­tended.</p>
