    <p>• Elon Musk’s year of dizzy­ing as­cents hit a new high as the Tesla co-founder passed Mi­crosoft’s Bill Gates to be­come the world’s sec­on­drich­est per­son.</p>
    <p>The 49-year-old en­tre­pre­neur’s net worth hit US$127.9 bil­lion (S$171.7 bil­lion), up US$7.2 bil­lion, driven by yet an­other surge i n Tesla’s share price. Mr Musk has added US$100.3 bil­lion to his net worth this year, the most of any­one on the Bloomberg Bil­lion­aires In­dex, a rank­ing of the world’s 500 rich­est peo­ple. In Jan­uary, he ranked 35th.</p>
    <p>His ad­vance up the wealth ranks has been driven largely by the elec­tric-car maker, whose mar­ket value passed US$500 bil­lion on Tues­day. Tesla’s shares surged 6.4 per cent to US$555.38 in New York, ex­tend­ing a me­te­oric rally that has seen the stock gain more than six times this year. The stock has risen nearly 28 per cent since the S&P Dow Jones In­dices de­cided to add the firm to the bench­mark in­dex from Dec 21.</p>
    <p>Tesla has be­come by far the world’s most valu­able car­maker, de­spite a pro­duc­tion that is a frac­tion of Toy­ota Mo­tor, Volk­swa­gen or Gen­eral Mo­tors.</p>
    <p>Shares of other elec­tric ve­hi­cle (EV) mak­ers have also risen in the last few months as United States Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den made boost­ing EVs a top pri­or­ity dur­ing his cam­paign.</p>
    <p>“One of the core un­der­pin­nings of the Bi­den plat­form will be around push­ing clean en­ergy and zero-emis­sions ve­hi­cles with hopes of ac­cel­er­at­ing the de­ployment of elec­tric ve­hi­cles and public charg­ing out­lets by 2030,” Wed­bush an­a­lyst Daniel Ives said in a note.</p>
    <p>About three-quar­ters of Mr Musk’s net worth is com­prised of Tesla’s shares, which are val­ued more than four times as much as his stake in Space Ex­plo­ration Tech­nolo­gies or SpaceX.</p>
    <p>Mr Musk’s mile­stone marks only the sec­ond time in the in­dex’s eight-year his­tory that Mi­crosoft co-founder Mr Gates has ranked lower than No. 2. He held the top spot for years be­fore be­ing bumped by Ama­zon.com founder Jeff Be­zos in 2017.</p>
    <p>The year has been a lu­cra­tive one for the world’s rich­est peo­ple. De­spite the pan­demic and wide­spread lay­offs that have dis­pro­por­tion­ately af­fected the world’s work­ing class and poor, the mem­bers of the Bloomberg in­dex have col­lec­tively gained 23 per cent – or US$1.3 tril­lion – since the year be­gan.</p>
    <p>Those in the elec­tric ve­hi­cle in­dus­try have been par­tic­u­lar ben­e­fi­cia­ries. The com­bined for­tune of Con­tem­po­rary Am­perex Tech­nol­ogy chair­man and vice-chair­man of China’s big­gest EV bat­tery maker, Mr Zeng Yuqun and Mr Huang Shilin, has soared by US$18.8 bil­lion year-to-date, ac­cord­ing to the in­dex.</p>
