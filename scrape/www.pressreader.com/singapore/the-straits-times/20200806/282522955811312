    <p>It is re­fresh­ing to see a lo­cal drama that does not re­volve around bick­er­ing neigh­bours, but is in­stead cen­tred on im­pe­rial in­trigue set some 500 years ago in the Ming Dy­nasty.</p>
    <p>A Quest To Heal, partly filmed in China’s Heng­dian film stu­dio, be­gins in the reign of Em­peror Ji­a­jing (1521 to 1567).</p>
    <p>Luo Mingyi (Car­rie Wong), the feisty daugh­ter of a physi­cian, ac­com­pa­nies her fa­ther’s dis­ci­ple Li Shizhen (Xu Bin) – based on the fa­mous real-life physi­cian – as he goes to the cap­i­tal city to work for a duke (Jef­frey Xu).</p>
    <p>There, Luo re-en­coun­ters child­hood friend Bi Zheng (Qi Yuwu), now a high-rank­ing and haughty mem­ber of the em­broi­dered uni­form guards.</p>
    <p>In the first episode, view­ers also catch a glimpse of the se­nior eu­nuch, Sun Gong­gong, played by the scene-steal­ing Bryan Wong.</p>
    <p>Li is later em­broiled in an in­ves­ti­ga­tion in­volv­ing mute palace maid Ya San (Ya Hui) and locked up by the uni­formed guards. Luo goes to his res­cue, but is chased by Bi. They cross swords in a dark cave and dis­ap­pear when light­ning strikes.</p>
    <p>When view­ers next see them, the duo have fallen into mod­ern-day Sin­ga­pore in a time-travel plot twist that is any­thing but fresh.</p>
    <p>As early as 1985, there was Man From The Past, a Chan­nel 8 drama star­ring Chen Tian­wen as an­cient hero Wu Sanqi who wakes up in the Lion City.</p>
    <p>Still, one is pleas­antly sur­prised to see Qi, who can be rather wooden in his ex­pres­sions, pull off funny lines. As the time trav­ellers stare at pass­ing ve­hi­cles, they won­der if this is hell. Bi mut­ters: “No won­der it is so hot.”</p>
    <p>The chem­istry be­tween Qi and Wong, whose act­ing is rather one-note, is less than siz­zling, though.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, Luo bumps into a looka­like of Li, who turns out to be his de­scen­dant Li Jishi (also played by Xu Bin). With the young man’s help, Luo and Bi try to re­turn to the past to un­ravel the mys­tery.</p>
    <p>In the show, the past is lit­er­ally a for­eign coun­try and a lot more al­lur­ing with its court­yards, cloaks and dag­gers; the mod­ern scenes, set mainly in a Chi­nese herbal res­tau­rant, are a bit of a bore.</p>
    <p>The drama gets the thumbs up for the look of its char­ac­ters in the pe­riod scenes – Qi cuts a dash­ing fig­ure with his cape and goa­tee, Bryan Wong is re­splen­dent in laven­der.</p>
    <p>It is com­mend­able but falls short of be­ing com­pelling. One wishes Mediacorp had set the show wholly in the past.</p>
    <p>The past also fig­ures promi­nently in Grace­ful Friends, which is touted to be an­other po­ten­tial block­buster drama from South Korean broad­caster JTBC, and a cross be­tween World Of The Mar­ried (2020) and Sky Cas­tle (2018 to 2019).</p>
    <p>The mur­der mys­tery fol­lows a group of mid­dle-aged bud­dies who were mem­bers of a drama so­ci­ety in univer­sity.</p>
    <p>When a young man is found dead in the shower, one of the friends – the de­part­ment head of a fried chicken fran­chise played by Yoo Joon-sang – be­comes a sus­pect.</p>
    <p>His pals – a hen­pecked film di­rec­tor (Kim Sung-oh), a di­vorced sur­geon who is hard to read (Bae Soo-bin) and a sales­man (Jung Suk-yong) with a much younger wife – won­der how their friend is linked to the dead man.</p>
    <p>Un­known to them, the young man had been black­mail­ing their friend’s wife, a doc­tor played by Song Yoon-ah. The man is the wife’s golf in­struc­tor</p>
    <p>(Lee Tae-hwan) and he took pic­tures of her in the nude af­ter spik­ing her drink at a bar one night.</p>
    <p>In­stead of go­ing to the po­lice, she in­sists on deal­ing with the mat­ter her­self so the pho­tos will not be made pub­lic.</p>
    <p>The case seems linked to in­ci­dents hark­ing back to the friends’ univer­sity days, with Yoo’s char­ac­ter sim­i­larly ques­tioned by the po­lice af­ter stum­bling on the corpse of a lec­turer.</p>
    <p>This en­sem­ble drama is a tad melo­dra­matic, but reels you in with its sus­pense, well-writ­ten char­ac­ters and ster­ling act­ing.</p>
    <p>Song is es­pe­cially af­fect­ing as the out­wardly tough doc­tor who has more se­crets than she can han­dle.</p>
    <p>All the bud­dies have prob­lems of their own, in­clud­ing Jung’s sales­man char­ac­ter, who has to bear with the indig­ni­ties of erec­tile dys­func­tion and be­ing mis­taken for his daugh­ter’s grand­fa­ther.</p>
    <p>Mid­dle age, as de­picted here, has never seemed less grace­ful.</p>
