    <p>The dol­lar teetered near mile­stone lows yes­ter­day, after a triple blow of re­treat­ing yields, soft United States eco­nomic data and a dip in safe­haven demand ex­erted broad sell­ing pres­sure.</p>
    <p>Against the euro, Aus­tralian dol­lar, pound, Swiss franc and yuan, it is poised to retest multi-month or multi-year troughs made ear­lier in the month, though moves in morn­ing trade were small as to­day’s re­lease of the Fed­eral Re­serve min­utes loomed on the hori­zon.</p>
    <p>The euro last sat at US$1.1874, just be­low a re­cent two-year high of US$1.1916. The Aussie dol­lar was steady at US$0.7213 and close to an 18-month top of US$0.7242 hit on Aug 7.</p>
    <p>In­vestors heaved re­lief over a de­lay in the re­view of the US-China trade deal last week, which has left the agree­ment standing and re­in­forced a be­lief that the trade re­la­tion­ship can hold even amid con­flict on mul­ti­ple other fronts.</p>
    <p>Adding to the pos­i­tive mood was a fresh rally in tech stocks, which to­gether with a pull­back in US yields and a weak read­ing in a US man­u­fac­tur­ing sur­vey, has many traders stick­ing to their bear­ish con­vic­tions on the dol­lar.</p>
    <p>Net bear­ish bets on the US dol­lar grew to their largest since May 2011 last week, and spot trade in re­cent days sug­gest the po­si­tion has only grown fur­ther since. “Ex­tended short dol­lar po­si­tions risk a sharp pull­back if the dol­lar down­side stalls fur­ther, but for now, the neg­a­tives for the dol­lar are mostly still in place,” said an­a­lysts at OCBC Bank.</p>
    <p>“We are re­duced to stay­ing in the game while the mu­sic is play­ing.”</p>
    <p>OCBC called out soft data, the po­lit­i­cal im­passe hold­ing up US fis­cal stim­u­lus and a “lim­ited ap­petite for in­ter­pret­ing Sino-US re­la­tions as be­ing in an out­right down­ward spi­ral” as back­ing the dol­lar’s gloomy out­look.</p>
    <p>Un­der­scor­ing that view, the yuan sat at 6.9306 per dol­lar, within range of a five-month high of 6.9280, de­spite the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion flag­ging a fur­ther tight­en­ing of re­stric­tions against Chi­nese tech gear maker Huawei.</p>
    <p>On the data front, the New York Fed’s Em­pire State busi­ness con­di­tions in­dex tum­bled to 3.7 this month from 17.2 last month – far lower than the 15 points forecast by a Reuters sur­vey.</p>
