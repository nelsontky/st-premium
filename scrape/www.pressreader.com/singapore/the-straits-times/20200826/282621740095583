    <p>NOT AN IDEAL “STAY­CA­TION”: Lo­cal ac­tor Jeremy Chan (left) was ad­mit­ted to hos­pi­tal on Sun­day af­ter­noon for an al­ler­gic re­ac­tion caused by an in­jec­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the 39-year-old did not fail to see the hu­mour in the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Known for roles in films such as com­edy Lucky Boy (2017), as well as in dra­mas in­clud­ing Me­di­a­corp pro­duc­tion, Su­per Dad (2020), Chan shared an im­age of him­self on an In­sta­gram Story.</p>
    <p>Look­ing mis­er­able while ly­ing on a hos­pi­tal bed, hooked up to an oxy­gen tank, he wrote: “Why is my stay­ca­tion here?”</p>
    <p>The ac­tor, who has been mar­ried to</p>
    <p>ac­tress Jesseca Liu for three years, added: “This is the first time in my life rid­ing in an am­bu­lance.”</p>
    <p>Liu, 41, told en­ter­tain­ment and life­style news web­site 8 Days that the hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion was for a drug al­lergy. She said he went to the clinic for an in­jec­tion but his body re­acted badly and he was sent to the hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>She con­tin­ued: “He puked and his whole body was shak­ing... and he had dif­fi­culty breath­ing.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Liu, Chan has been hav­ing rashes, fever and body aches. He has since had an­other jab in the hos­pi­tal and it is un­clear when Chan will be dis­charged.</p>
