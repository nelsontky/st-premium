    <p>More than two months since the third wave of Covid-19 swept through the city, Hong Kong is mov­ing to ease some re­stric­tions and boost­ing the econ­omy with a third stim­u­lus pack­age to­talling HK$24 bil­lion (S$4.21 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam told a brief­ing yes­ter­day that the city had recorded no new com­mu­nity in­fec­tions – the first time the daily num­ber went down to zero since early July.</p>
    <p>The health au­thor­i­ties con­firmed four new im­ported cases, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber of con­firmed cases to 4,975, in­clud­ing 101 deaths.</p>
    <p>Sec­re­tary for Food and Health Sophia Chan an­nounced at the brief­ing that from Fri­day, din­ing-in ser­vices will be ex­tended from the current 10 pm to mid­night for a week, with the cap on pub­lic gath­er­ings to re­main at four.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses that were not re­opened in pre­vi­ous rounds of eas­ing such as pubs, bars, karaoke joints, party rooms, swim­ming pools, ex­hi­bi­tion venues and the two theme parks – Dis­ney­land and Ocean Park – will be al­lowed to have vis­i­tors again but sub­ject to strict in­fec­tion con­trol re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>Ocean Park has said it will re­open on Fri­day but Hong Kong Dis­ney­land has not set a date.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, the au­thor­i­ties yes­ter­day an­nounced a third round of eco­nomic re­lief mea­sures, in­clud­ing some HK$10 bil­lion ear­marked to pro­cure vac­cines, HK$4.5 bil­lion to help 23 im­pacted in­dus­tries such as tourism and the food and bev­er­age sec­tors, as well as HK$6 bil­lion on rent con­ces­sions.</p>
    <p>The re­lief pack­age is meant to sup­port strug­gling busi­nesses and will bring the to­tal bud­get deficit to more than HK$300 bil­lion, Fi­nan­cial Sec­re­tary Paul Chan said.</p>
    <p>He added that fis­cal re­serves will drop to about HK$800 bil­lion or 12 to 13 months of gov­ern­ment ex­pen­di­ture – close to what it was dur­ing the se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome pan­demic in 2003.</p>
    <p>Pledg­ing to be pru­dent in help­ing en­ter­prises and in­di­vid­u­als, Mr Chan said: “At the same time, we have to pre­serve our strength to pre­pare for the un­known. We have to pre­serve our fis­cal strength to main­tain confidence in our fi­nances.”</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has al­ready spent an un­prece­dented HK$287 bil­lion or 10 per cent of the city’s gross domestic prod­uct (GDP). This in­cludes sup­port through the anti-epi­demic fund to­talling some HK$150 bil­lion, as well as var­i­ous other re­lief mea­sures that amounted to HK$120 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>As at end Au­gust, the gov­ern­ment has spent HK$78 bil­lion to help 4.3 mil­lion peo­ple and 450,000 en­ter­prises and com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>More than 150,000 em­ploy­ers and 110,000 self-em­ployed per­sons sought help un­der the employment sup­port scheme in the first tranche of sup­port mea­sures.</p>
    <p>In the sec­ond tranche, the gov­ern­ment has re­ceived 158,000 ap­pli­ca­tions from em­ploy­ers and 26,000 self-em­ployed peo­ple.</p>
    <p>In an­tic­i­pa­tion of a fourth wave of Covid-19 in the com­ing win­ter sea­son, the gov­ern­ment has de­cided to ramp up the pub­lic hos­pi­tals’ gen­eral out­pa­tient testing pro­gramme to over 40 clin­ics at the end of the month, up from 22 now.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of daily test kits to be made avail­able will also rise to 4,000 from the ex­ist­ing 2,400.</p>
    <p>Testing of spe­cific high-risk groups will con­tinue to pre­vent clus­ters.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials said al­most 1.8 mil­lion were tested for the virus and at least 42 were found to be pos­i­tive at the end of a two-week vol­un­tary free mass testing pro­gramme on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>They added that the ex­er­cise cost the gov­ern­ment HK$530 mil­lion, of which 70 per cent or HK$370 mil­lion were med­i­cal and sup­port staff salaries.</p>
