    <p>HONG KONG • Global wealth man­agers are ex­am­in­ing whether their clients in Hong Kong have ties to the city’s pro-democ­racy move­ment, in an at­tempt to avoid get­ting caught in the crosshairs of China’s new na­tional se­cu­rity law, ac­cord­ing to six peo­ple with knowl­edge of the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Bankers at Credit Suisse, HSBC, Julius Baer and UBS, among oth­ers, are broad­en­ing scru­tiny un­der their pro­grammes that screen clients for po­lit­i­cal and gov­ern­ment ties and sub­ject­ing them to ad­di­tional dili­gence re­quire­ments, th­ese peo­ple said.</p>
    <p>The des­ig­na­tion, called po­lit­i­cally ex­posed per­sons, can make it more dif­fi­cult or al­to­gether pre­vent peo­ple from ac­cess­ing bank­ing ser­vices, de­pend­ing on what the bank finds out about the per­son’s source of wealth or fi­nan­cial trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>The checks at some wealth man­agers have in­volved comb­ing through com­ments made by clients and their as­so­ci­ates in pub­lic and in me­dia, and so­cial me­dia posts in the re­cent past, th­ese peo­ple said. The new law pro­hibits what Beijing de­scribes broadly as se­ces­sion, sub­ver­sion, ter­ror­ism and col­lu­sion with for­eign forces, with up to life in prison for of­fend­ers.</p>
    <p>The sources, who re­quested anonymity, said the broad­ened scru­tiny of clients also ap­plied to Hong Kong and Chi­nese of­fi­cials who had im­ple­mented the law, in an­tic­i­pa­tion of any sanc­tions by the United States against them.</p>
    <p>A banker at a global wealth man­ager that holds more than US$200 bil­lion (S$278 bil­lion) in as­sets said the au­dit of its clients could go back as far as 2014 to gauge a client’s po­lit­i­cal stance since Hong Kong’s pro-democ­racy Um­brella Move­ment that year. Pro­test­ers at the time used um­brel­las to shield them­selves from tear gas and pep­per spray de­ployed by po­lice.</p>
    <p>Reuters could not learn the iden­ti­ties of any peo­ple who had faced en­hanced scru­tiny or whether the banks had de­cided to take any ac­tion against peo­ple iden­ti­fied as po­lit­i­cally ex­posed.</p>
    <p>Mr Al­bert Ho, a vet­eran Hong Kong demo­crat who runs a law firm and helps or­gan­ise an an­nual can­dle­light vigil to com­mem­o­rate the June 4, 1989 Tianan­men Square crack­down, said he feared that peo­ple like him may face “dif­fi­cul­ties in the times to come”.</p>
    <p>“There’s not much you can do, ac­tu­ally, un­less you cease all your fi­nan­cial and bank­ing ac­tiv­i­ties in Hong Kong,” Mr Ho said yes­ter­day, adding that he had not faced ad­di­tional scru­tiny from his bank as of last week. He de­clined to dis­close the name of his bank.</p>
    <p>HSBC de­clined to com­ment specif­i­cally on the se­cu­rity law or any US move to sanc­tion lo­cal of­fi­cials. In an e-mailed state­ment, it said: “We al­ready have a strin­gent set of poli­cies and rig­or­ous pro­cesses in place which we ap­ply glob­ally.”</p>
    <p>Credit Suisse, Julius Baer and UBS de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>When asked about the scru­tiny af­ter it an­nounced its half-year re­sults yes­ter­day, Julius Baer CEO Philipp Rick­en­bacher also de­clined to com­ment, adding that the bank would con­tinue to de­velop its busi­ness in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>In an e-mailed state­ment, the Hong Kong Mon­e­tary Author­ity said the fi­nan­cial hub im­ple­ments anti-money laun­der­ing re­quire­ments “based on in­ter­na­tional stan­dards, in­clud­ing with re­gard to po­lit­i­cally ex­posed per­sons”.</p>
    <p>The city’s de­facto cen­tral bank added: “The rel­e­vant in­ter­na­tional stan­dards and our guid­ance to the bank­ing in­dus­try have not changed.”</p>
    <p>China’s For­eign Min­istry, the Li­ai­son Of­fice in Hong Kong and the State Coun­cil’s Hong Kong and Ma­cau Af­fairs Of­fice did not re­spond to re­quests for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Global banks have long ex­am­ined the back­grounds of their clients, in­clud­ing screen­ing them for po­lit­i­cal ties, to sat­isfy reg­u­la­tory re­quire­ments. Politi­cians, gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials and se­nior ex­ec­u­tives at sta­te­owned en­ter­prises, as well as their fam­ily mem­bers, are typ­i­cally con­sid­ered to be po­lit­i­cally ex­posed per­sons.</p>
    <p>The rules are meant to en­force laws such as in­ter­na­tional sanc­tions and to pre­vent peo­ple from us­ing the bank­ing sys­tem to launder ill-got­ten wealth.</p>
    <p>The banks’ move to sub­ject sup­port­ers of Hong Kong’s democ­racy move­ment to a sim­i­lar re­view comes at a time when the stance of some firms on the Chi­nese law has drawn scru­tiny from Western law­mak­ers and ac­tivists.</p>
    <p>HSBC and Stan­dard Char­tered, which have ex­pressed sup­port for the na­tional se­cu­rity law, for ex­am­ple, have f aced crit­i­cism from Bri­tish of­fi­cials that their ac­tions en­abled Beijing to un­der­mine the rule of law in the for­mer Bri­tish colony.</p>
    <p>The two Lon­don-head­quar­tered banks have said they be­lieved the law would re­store sta­bil­ity in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Both Hong Kong and Chi­nese of­fi­cials have said the law was vi­tal to plug holes in na­tional se­cu­rity de­fences, re­ject­ing crit­i­cism from gov­ern­ments, in­clud­ing the US and the United King­dom, that China was vi­o­lat­ing its prom­ise to safe­guard Hong Kong’s free­dom for 50 years af­ter the 1997 han­dover.</p>
    <p>Some wealth man­agers in Hong Kong have said they are wor­ried about the reg­u­la­tory and rep­u­ta­tion risks to their banks if charges un­der the sweep­ing se­cu­rity law are brought against some of their po­lit­i­cally linked clients, three of the sources said.</p>
    <p>A top ex­ec­u­tive at a re­gional wealth man­ager said that his firm’s risk and com­pli­ance team pre­pared a list of top 10 Hong Kong in­di­vid­u­als iden­ti­fied in lo­cal me­dia as prodemoc­racy sym­pa­this­ers within a cou­ple of days of the en­act­ment of the law on July 1, the an­niver­sary of the han­dover.</p>
    <p>The ex­ec­u­tive said his firm checked its in­ter­nal data­base to see if there was any ex­ist­ing re­la­tion­ship with any of them and was “quite relieved” to find noth­ing.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral el­e­ments of the law deal with the seizure of as­sets, in­clud­ing pro­vi­sions to give a new po­lice unit greater pow­ers to freeze and con­fis­cate funds and prop­erty as well as greater pow­ers to ob­tain in­for­ma­tion. Com­pa­nies can also face penal­ties, rang­ing from fines and sus­pen­sion to the loss of busi­ness li­cences.</p>
    <p>One in­vest­ment man­ager at a Hong Kong-based hedge fund said he ex­pected more peo­ple to come un­der scru­tiny from their bankers.</p>
    <p>“I think that if even a moder­ate demo­crat came through the door want­ing to in­vest, you’d be think­ing long and hard af­ter this law,” the fund man­ager said.</p>
