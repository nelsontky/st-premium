    <p>MR RYAN TEO, a fi­nal-year stu­dent at North­west­ern Univer­sity in Illi­nois, US, who was part of a four-mem­ber team that won an in­ter­na­tional de­sign com­pe­ti­tion with a “pan­demic-proof” bus.</p>
    <p>PUB­LIC TRANS­PORT OF THE FU­TURE</p>
    <p>It’s al­ways been clear to me that Sin­ga­pore has one of the best pub­lic trans­port sys­tems in the world. That said, no sys­tem in the world is suited for a pan­demic sit­u­a­tion... Our Fu­ture­bus con­cept was de­signed with this in mind as we asked our­selves: How might we keep pub­lic trans­port safe with­out low­er­ing the ve­hi­cle’s ca­pac­ity?</p>
    <p>A 23-year-old Sin­ga­porean stu­dent is part of a four-mem­ber team that has won an in­ter­na­tional de­sign com­pe­ti­tion with a “pan­demicproof” bus.</p>
    <p>Mr Ryan Teo, to­gether with three foreign stu­dents he had met only via Zoom, cre­ated what they call the Fu­ture­bus in just 24 hours.</p>
    <p>The ve­hi­cle’s fea­tures in­clude a slid­ing door span­ning the full length of the bus, re­mote pay­ment tech­nol­ogy that does away with phys­i­cal card readers, and a ro­tat­ing handrail that is ster­ilised by an ul­tra­vi­o­let strip.</p>
    <p>Mr Teo said the de­sign could make pub­lic trans­port safer with­out low­er­ing the ca­pac­ity of the bus, the in­evitable re­sult of so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures around the world amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“It’s al­ways been clear to me that Sin­ga­pore has one of the best pub­lic trans­port sys­tems in the world. That said, no sys­tem in the world is suited for a pan­demic sit­u­a­tion,” said the fi­nal-year prod­uct de­sign and en­gi­neer­ing stu­dent at North­west­ern Univer­sity in Illi­nois.</p>
    <p>“Our Fu­ture­bus con­cept was de­signed with this in mind as we asked our­selves: How might we keep pub­lic trans­port safe with­out low­er­ing the ve­hi­cle’s ca­pac­ity?”</p>
    <p>The FourC Chal­lenge in June, or­gan­ised by Shang­hai Jiao Tong Univer­sity, saw more than 200 stu­dents from 52 uni­ver­si­ties com­pete in a 24-hour “de­sign sprint”.</p>
    <p>Teams were set up ran­domly by or­gan­is­ers and col­lab­o­ra­tion took place re­motely.</p>
    <p>Mr Teo’s team won the 50,000 yuan (S$10,000) grand prize, and its win­ning en­try has since at­tracted me­dia at­ten­tion from var­i­ous coun­tries in­clud­ing the United States, China, and Spain.</p>
    <p>The other three mem­bers of the team are Mr Yang Shunli from Hong Kong Poly­tech­nic Univer­sity, Mr Wil­liam Ma from Har­vard Univer­sity, and Mr Li Xin from Shang­hai Jiao Tong Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Mr Teo said his team’s ideas, while in­ven­tive, were adapted from tech­nol­ogy al­ready avail­able. While it was more of a “thought ex­per­i­ment”, the team tried to make sure the Fu­ture­bus was a vi­able pro­posal, both in terms of cost and plau­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>The ro­tat­ing handrail, for i nstance, was in­spired by the toi­let seat found at Chicago O’Hare In­ter­na­tional Air­port which ro­tates its cover af­ter each use.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, the Fu­ture­bus’ handrail will ro­tate 360 de­grees each time the ve­hi­cle is at a bus stop so that it can be cleaned with­out pas­sen­gers hav­ing to ad­just their grip.</p>
    <p>The re­mote pay­ment sys­tem also al­ready ex­ists. Mr Teo cited a sys­tem de­vel­oped by ST En­gi­neer­ing which re­quires a com­muter to carry only a long-range ra­dio-fre­quency iden­ti­fi­ca­tion wrist­band, card or key tag.</p>
    <p>Com­muters can then walk through a bar­rier-free frame and have their fare au­to­mat­i­cally de­ducted with­out hav­ing to tap a card or wait for a gate to open.</p>
    <p>To­gether with the ve­hi­cle’s long slid­ing door, com­muters will not have to clus­ter around the nar­row doors where card readers are typ­i­cally lo­cated in buses.</p>
    <p>“We re­designed the floor plan of the bus to min­imise pas­sen­ger path-cross­ing,” Mr Teo said. “(This way), pas­sen­gers can di­rectly step off the bus in­stead of hav­ing to walk through the bus to get to the exit.”</p>
    <p>Other prob­lems were solved in a rel­a­tively low-tech man­ner.</p>
    <p>The t eam in­ter­viewed com­muters and found a de­sire for pri­vate spa­ces in pub­lic ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>To achieve this, Mr Teo’s team sim­ply al­ter­nated the di­rec­tion of the bus seats so that no two com­muters sit­ting side by side face the same di­rec­tion, cre­at­ing a “co­coon of semi-pri­vate space” for each pas­sen­ger.</p>
    <p>Asked if he hoped to see his team’s de­sign im­ple­mented soon,</p>
    <p>Mr Teo said: “Our de­sign process was ex­tremely rushed as we tried to fit what would nor­mally take months or years, into just 24 hours.</p>
    <p>“But I think pan­demic-proof­ing should be con­sid­ered as part of fu­ture de­sign cri­te­ria as reg­u­lar in­fra­struc­ture im­prove­ments are made over the next few decades.”</p>
