    <p>Ssangyong’s lat­est Ko­rando wields dis­arm­ing de­sign and value for money to woo buy­ers in a crowded seg­ment</p>
    <p>Last month, I caught South Korean mar­tial arts flick The Swords­man, which turned out to be one of the most en­joy­able movies I have seen. It tells the story of a swords­man liv­ing as a hermit who is forced to fight again to res­cue his daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>In some ways, the Ssangyong Ko­rando sport util­ity ve­hi­cle re­minds me of the pro­tag­o­nist be­cause, like him, it also faces an up­hill task against strong ri­vals.</p>
    <p>The lat­est fourth-gen­er­a­tion Ko­rando is a mid-sized cross­over bat­tling in a crowded seg­ment pop­u­lated by ac­com­plished cars such as the Peu­geot 3008 and Mazda CX-30. Pre­mium mar­ques such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Audi have (pricier) cars in the seg­ment too.</p>
    <p>To fight its com­peti­tors, the first weapon in Ko­rando’s ar­moury lies in its de­sign.</p>
    <p>Ssangyong is re­mem­bered for its odd­ball Acy­ton, which looks like a forcibly fused coupe and cross­over. But thank­fully, the de­signs of its re­cent mod­els like the Rex­ton and Tivoli are less po­lar­is­ing.</p>
    <p>The Ko­rando’s de­sign raises the bar fur­ther. It stands out with its LED day­time run­ning lights and a prom­i­nent front grille which</p>
    <p>Ssangyong says re­sem­bles the wings of a bird.</p>
    <p>Its un­painted wheel arches and rear bumper – to­gether with a rear spoiler and rear skid plate – give the cross­over a hint of sporti­ness and rugged­ness, even though it lacks four-wheel-drive.</p>
    <p>In­side, the Ko­rando has up­mar­ket fea­tures like a 10.25-inch dig­i­tal in­stru­ment clus­ter with three dis­play modes, and an eight-inch touch­screen in­fo­tain­ment unit which is com­pat­i­ble with An­droid Auto and Ap­ple CarPlay.</p>
    <p>Sporty pad­dle shifters be­hind the steer­ing wheel look like they were trans­planted from a hot hatch, which is odd be­cause Ssangyong does not have such a car.</p>
    <p>De­spite these up­mar­ket fea­tures, there are re­minders of the car’s util­i­tar­ian roots. The hand­brake is still man­ual and the fac­tory-fit­ted fab­ric seats are more hard-wear­ing than lux­u­ri­ous. The lo­cal agent is of­fer­ing a free up­grade to leather, though.</p>
    <p>The seat ad­just­ments are man­ual, but once the driver finds the cor­rect po­si­tion, the driv­ing po­si­tion is spot on. Vis­i­bil­ity in front and at the im­me­di­ate sides is good, but big blind spots lurk be­hind the thick C and D pil­lars.</p>
    <p>Space is gen­er­ous for both the</p>

    <p>The Ko­rando is pow­ered by a 1.5-litre tur­bocharged petrol en­gine paired with a six-speed Aisin au­to­matic gear­box. The pow­er­train is com­pe­tent, al­though not par­tic­u­larly en­gag­ing.</p>
    <p>Its 0-100kmh tim­ing of 12 sec­onds is slower than, say, the Skoda Karoq (nine sec­onds). The en­gine is boomy at higher speeds and springs to life from the shut­down mode with a dis­cernible shud­der.</p>
    <p>The sus­pen­sion is tuned for com­fort, which means the car is a lit­tle wil­lowy around the bends. The steer­ing is light and a tad vague, which makes the car easy to pi­lot for most mo­torists but un­ex­cit­ing for keen driv­ers.</p>
    <p>The fuel con­sump­tion is im­pres­sive. Over a two-day 131km test­drive, the car records a fuel con­sump­tion of 8.4 litres/100km, not far off the of­fi­cial fig­ure of 7 litres/100km.</p>
    <p>The Ko­rando will ap­peal to buy­ers who want the most bang for their buck. It of­fers road pres­ence, space and am­ple equip­ment at a sen­si­ble price – a heroic ef­fort for a rel­a­tively un­known name in an over­crowded seg­ment.</p>
