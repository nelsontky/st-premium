    <p>There were 11 new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, and for the sec­ond day in a row, all were im­ported cases, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>All 11 cases had been placed on stay-home no­tice or iso­lated upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, MOH added.</p>
    <p>They com­prise one Sin­ga­porean, three per­ma­nent res­i­dents, two work pass hold­ers, two work per­mit hold­ers, one de­pen­dant’s pass holder and two short-term visit pass hold­ers.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean man, 44, who re­turned from the United Arab Emi­rates, and the 52-year-old fe­male de­pen­dant’s pass holder, who ar­rived from Pak­istan, were con­tacts of a pre­vi­ous case.</p>
    <p>The three per­ma­nent res­i­dents re­turned from In­dia and Bahrain.</p>
    <p>Of the four pa­tients cur­rently em­ployed in Sin­ga­pore, two are work pass hold­ers who trav­elled from Nepal and two are work per­mit hold­ers who ar­rived from In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>One of the work per­mit hold­ers, who had the on­set of symp­toms on Tues­day, was a con­tact of a pre­vi­ous case.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing two cases are short-term visit pass hold­ers who trav­elled from In­done­sia and Myan­mar to visit their fam­ily mem</p>
    <p>bers in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>All 11 cases, of which two were symp­to­matic, tested pos­i­tive while serv­ing their no­tice.</p>
    <p>There were no new com­mu­nity cases and none from work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries, said MOH.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s new cases take Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,102.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with a to­tal of one case in the past week, which is cur­rently un­linked, added MOH.</p>
    <p>With 12 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,987 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 48 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tals, while 24 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 28 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, I drove my car to Vi­com in Kaki Bukit for the manda­tory ve­hi­cle in­spec­tion, which was de­ferred from June when all cen­tres were closed.</p>
    <p>I ob­served the fol­low­ing:</p>
    <p>There was no prom­i­nent QR code for safe en­try dis­played. There were some QR codes at the self-ser­vice kiosks, but the queues were long.</p>
    <p>• There were no safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors to check queue­ing dis­tances, or floor mark­ings at the cashier booth</p>
    <p>or self-ser­vice kiosks.</p>
    <p>• No tem­per­a­ture tak­ing was done. • No hand-wash­ing fa­cil­i­ties or</p>
    <p>hand sani­tiser was in sight. • Queues were al­ready long at</p>
    <p>9am.</p>
    <p>• Three ve­hi­cle in­spec­tors drove each car through the in­spec­tion line. All did not wear gloves and did not sani­tise their hands be­fore and af­ter driv­ing each car, and all cars were not wiped down at the end of the in­spec­tion queue.</p>
    <p>• Some cars had pas­sen­gers other</p>
    <p>than the driver.</p>
    <p>I was shocked to see the very lax safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>These had the mak­ings of a Covid-19 out­break, with no means of con­tact trac­ing if it were to hap­pen.</p>
    <p>All it would take is for one ve­hi­cle in­spec­tor to come into con­tact with a con­tam­i­nated sur­face in one car, and the spread of Covid-19 would swiftly fol­low.</p>
    <p>In any case, for pri­vate pas­sen­ger ve­hi­cles, given the re­duced use dur­ing Covid-19, why take this risk?</p>
    <p>Per­haps we could limit in­spec­tions to com­mer­cial and pri­vate-hire ve­hi­cles for now, un­til we en­ter phase three of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing.</p>
