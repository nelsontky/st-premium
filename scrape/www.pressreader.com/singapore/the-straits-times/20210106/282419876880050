    <p>The Ul­ti­mate Fight­ing Cham­pi­onship’s (UFC) an­nual Fight Night Sin­ga­pore event was one of the many lo­cal sports events that were put on the back­burner last year ow­ing to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But Kevin Chang, the Amer­i­can mixed mar­tial arts (MMA) or­gan­i­sa­tion’s se­nior vice-pres­i­dent (Asia-Pa­cific), told The Straits Times it is very keen on ex­tend­ing its pres­ence in Sin­ga­pore for this year and beyond.</p>
    <p>“We’re still very much main­tain­ing a great re­la­tion­ship (with the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) and we cer­tainly have plans,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The Covid sit­u­a­tion has re­quired us to have a lit­tle bit more cre­ativ­ity in our ap­proach and to the ex­ist­ing frame­work… (and) there’s still a bunch of work to be done.</p>
    <p>“I can’t say defini­tively right now 2021 (Fight Night Sin­ga­pore) is on, but we’re cer­tainly work­ing to­wards it and it’s a big goal for us.”</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to ST’s queries, Ong Ling Lee, STB’s di­rec­tor of sports, said: “UFC Fight Night is one of the key high­lights in Sin­ga­pore’s cal­en­dar of world-class sport­ing events and has helped to strengthen our po­si­tion as a re­gional sports tourism hub.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, she stressed that the re­sump­tion of leisure events in­clud­ing large-scale sports events needed to be car­ried out “in a care­ful and cal­i­brated man­ner” and that the pri­or­ity is the health and safety of lo­cals and vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>MMA was the first sport to stage a large-scale live event fea­tur­ing in­ter­na­tional ath­letes af­ter the coro­n­avirus-en­forced break, when the STB part­nered One Cham­pi­onship in a pi­lot pro­gramme in Oc­to­ber. One went on to stage three more live events in Sin­ga­pore be­fore the end of last year, with these fights al­low­ing a lim­ited tick­eted crowd of 250.</p>
    <p>The UFC has sev­eral event tiers and at the top of the pile are the pay-per-view (PPV) events such as those head­lined by su­per­star Conor Mc­Gre­gor, most of which are held in the United States. The buy rates for the top-rated events of­ten sur­pass the one mil­lion mark, with Mc­Gre­gor’s fight against Khabib Nur­magome­dov set­ting a 2.4 mil­lion buy rate record.</p>
    <p>Then there are its Fight Night events, which are aired on ESPN in the United States and are typ­i­cally head­lined by fighters who are in the top 10 of the UFC’s weight class rank­ing. These events rarely fea­ture ti­tle bouts, which are largely re­served for “num­bered” PPV events.</p>
    <p>The UFC staged its first Fight Night show here in 2014 at Ma­rina Bay Sands but re­turned only three years later, be­fore an­nounc­ing a three-year deal with STB that started from 2018. Since 2017, its shows have been held at the Sin­ga­pore In­door Sta­dium.</p>
    <p>For­mer UFC cham­pi­ons who have fought in Sin­ga­pore in­clude</p>
    <p>Holly Holm (women’s ban­tamweight), Rafael dos An­jos (light­weight) and An­drei Arlovski (heavy­weight), who were all on the card in 2017.</p>
    <p>There are also fighters who fea­tured in Sin­ga­pore as rel­a­tive un­knowns, namely Max Hol­loway (feather­weight) in 2014 and Petr Yan (ban­tamweight) in 2018, be­fore go­ing on to win world ti­tles.</p>
    <p>In line with the rel­a­tive lack of star power, at­ten­dances for the Sin­ga­pore fights have been mod­est.</p>
    <p>The UFC re­ported a com­bined gate of al­most 22,000 spec­ta­tors across its Fight Night Sin­ga­pore events from 2017 to 2019, with 2019’s at­ten­dance of 7,155 the UFC’s low­est gate across 42 live events around the world.</p>
    <p>But Chang in­sists Sin­ga­pore re­mains an “im­por­tant city” as the UFC con­tin­ues to try and ex­pand its reach in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Call­ing Sin­ga­pore a “trend­set­ter for South-east Asia”, the Amer­i­can said the UFC aims to pro­duce an even bet­ter event this year “to cre­ate more ex­cite­ment and more en­gage­ment with the fan base and new au­di­ences”.</p>
    <p>Deloitte sports busi­ness group leader James Wal­ton noted that a sin­gle an­nual show with about 8,000 spec­ta­tors “doesn’t jus­tify the cost of stag­ing the event” but said the UFC could ben­e­fit from de­vel­op­ing a lo­cal or re­gional fan base which could have an im­pact on other rev­enue streams like fran­chise gyms or mer­chan­dise.</p>
    <p>The Covid sit­u­a­tion has re­quired us to have a lit­tle bit more cre­ativ­ity in our ap­proach and to the ex­ist­ing frame­work… (and) there’s still a bunch of work to be done. I can’t say defini­tively right now 2021 (Fight Night Sin­ga­pore) is on, but we’re cer­tainly work­ing to­wards it and it’s a big goal for us.</p>
    <p>KEVIN CHANG, UFC’s se­nior vice-pres­i­dent (Asia-Pa­cific), on the post-Covid scene.</p>
    <p>GOOD SHOW</p>
    <p>UFC Fight Night is one of the key high­lights in Sin­ga­pore’s cal­en­dar of world-class sport­ing events and has helped to strengthen our po­si­tion as a re­gional sports tourism hub.</p>
    <p>ONG LING LEE, STB’s di­rec­tor of sports, hail­ing UFC’s role. UFC FIGHT NIGHT SIN­GA­PORE AT­TEN­DANCES 2014 2015-2016 5,216 Not held 2017 8,414 2018 6,419 2019 7,155 2020 Not held</p>
    <p>There is also value for Sin­ga­pore to have the UFC on its events cal­en­dar for ex­po­sure and brand­ing, par­tic­u­larly in the wake of a Covid-dis­rupted year, he added.</p>
    <p>“It shows we are open for busi­ness, and it tells in­ter­na­tional event or­gan­is­ers that we are ready and avail­able to host in­ter­na­tional sport­ing events and ma­jor events in a post-Covid world,” said Wal­ton.</p>
