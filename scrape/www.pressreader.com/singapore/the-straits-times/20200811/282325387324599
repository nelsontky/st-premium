    <p>SAN FRAN­CISCO • China’s Li Hao­tong walked away from the PGA Cham­pi­onship on Sun­day with re­newed self-be­lief that he can tri­umph on golf’s big­gest stage soon.</p>
    <p>He en­joyed a small slice of his­tory when he be­came the first Chi­nese golfer to lead in any round of a Ma­jor cham­pi­onship by grab­bing the half­way lead at TPC Hard­ing Park on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>While week­end rounds of three­over 73 and 69 for a to­tal of six-un­der 274 saw him end a mem­o­rable week in joint 17th po­si­tion, he said the ex­pe­ri­ence gained will be cru­cial as he con­tin­ues his pur­suit for suc­cess at the high­est level.</p>
    <p>“I just need to be more con­sis­tent, and phys­i­cally, as well. I think if I play my best, I can beat them. Just want to try to be in the (same) level,” said Li, whose best fin­ish in a Ma­jor re­mains a third­placed fin­ish at the 2017 Open Cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>He con­ceded the pres­sure of lead­ing a Ma­jor got to him, but vowed to learn from the ex­pe­ri­ence. “Saturday was very stress­ful. Since I wake up… since I’ve never been there be­fore. I just felt su­per tired, not be­cause of prac­tice, but to­day I felt like ev­ery­thing is re­leased,” Li, 25, said.</p>
    <p>“I played re­ally well un­til 16, missed a short birdie putt, and 18, I just want to go ag­gres­sive, try to make a birdie, and went a lit­tle bit left (into a penalty area). Yeah, it’s great ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Tiger Woods, who carded a fi­nal-round 67 to fin­ish one-un­der 279 and tied 37th over­all at the year’s first Ma­jor, re­vealed plans to ramp up his play­ing sched­ule ahead of next month’s US Open at Winged Foot.</p>
    <p>He won last year’s Masters for his 15th Ma­jor and is three short of Jack Nick­laus’ record.</p>
    <p>The PGA Cham­pi­onship was just his sec­ond Tour tour­na­ment since Fe­bru­ary’s Genesis In­vi­ta­tional and he ac­knowl­edged he needed to get more com­pet­i­tive golf un­der his belt.</p>
    <p>“We knew once I started play­ing again when I com­mit­ted to Me­mo­rial that this was going to be a heavy work­load, and my train­ing ses­sions, we’ve been push­ing it pretty hard, mak­ing sure that I kept my strength and en­durance up,” he said of his sched­ule, in­di­cat­ing his next ap­pear­ance will likely to be at next week’s North­ern Trust at TPC Bos­ton.</p>
    <p>One pos­i­tive was that his aching back, which has been sur­gi­cally re­paired, held up un­der pres­sure.</p>
    <p>“Over­all the body re­acted pretty good,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The best thing to do is stay out of the rough and not have any of those jar­ring shots.</p>
    <p>The 44-year-old Woods en­tered the PGA Cham­pi­onship 48th in the FedEx Cup stand­ings and will need a strong show­ing in Bos­ton and at the BMW Cham­pi­onship at Olympia Fields if he wants to qual­ify for the Tour Cham­pi­onship at East Lake, which has a field of 30.</p>
