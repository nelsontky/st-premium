    <p>As Gothic ro­mances go, few have the pedi­gree of Re­becca, au­thor Daphne du Mau­rier’s clas­sic 1938 mys­tery thriller, which in turn in­spired direc­tor Al­fred Hitch­cock’s 1940 film of the same name star­ring Lau­rence Olivier and Joan Fon­taine, win­ner of a Best Pic­ture Os­car.</p>
    <p>So the stars of the new Re­becca that de­buted on Net­flix this week, Lily James and Armie Ham­mer, knew they had big shoes to fill as they re­told the story – about an un­named young woman (James) who mar­ries a rich wi­d­ower, Maxim de Win­ter (Ham­mer), then grows ob­sessed with his late wife Re­becca.</p>
    <p>Chat­ting with The Straits Times and other press by video call re­cently, the pair say they did their best not to be too in­tim­i­dated by the Hitch­cock ver­sion and in­stead fo­cus on their own, which they be­lieve is still re­lat­able as a psy­cho­log­i­cal drama to­day.</p>
    <p>Direc­tor Ben Wheat­ley (Kill List, 2011) did not want ei­ther of them to think too much about the ear­lier film, they say.</p>
    <p>James, an English ac­tress best known for the pe­riod drama Down­ton Abbey (2012 to 2014), watched the first Re­becca more than a year be­fore be­gin­ning work on this one.</p>
    <p>“So it was not too fresh in my mem­ory when we shot,” the 31-year-old says.</p>
    <p>Ham­mer, the Amer­i­can star of dra­mas such as Call Me By Your Name (2017), did not watch it at all.</p>
    <p>“I did not want to be in­flu­enced – and Ben didn’t want me to be in­flu­enced by any­thing any­one else did. We are mak­ing our own adap­ta­tion of the book, not the movie,” he says.</p>
    <p>Still, Ham­mer, 34, ad­mits to be­ing slightly in­tim­i­dated by the thought of play­ing a char­ac­ter made fa­mous by the late, great Olivier.</p>
    <p>“I mean, Sir Lau­rence Olivier was an ac­tor who was so good at act­ing, they named an act­ing award af­ter him,” he quips, re­fer­ring to the an­nual Bri­tish theatre awards.</p>
    <p>This take is also slightly dif­fer­ent from Hitch­cock’s, he adds.</p>
    <p>There’s a fas­ci­na­tion with want­ing to know what it was like and what the peo­ple were like in times gone by. But it’s of­ten the same... Peo­ple’s own in­ner de­mons and anx­i­eties and pres­sures are the same, and the ways men and women re­late to one another are pretty sim­i­lar.</p>
    <p>“We did want to mod­ernise it, and make it palat­able and ap­proach­able for a mod­ern au­di­ence.”</p>
    <p>James has played clas­sic lit­er­ary and screen hero­ines be­fore. She was Elis­a­beth Ben­net in the ac­tion par­ody Pride And Prej­u­dice And Zom­bies (2016), and Eve in a 2019 stage adap­ta­tion of the film All About Eve (1950).</p>
    <p>And she feels some trep­i­da­tion when­ever she takes on these roles. “You’re ap­pre­hen­sive to take on some­thing that great ac­tors be­fore you have, and that have been huge suc­cesses and are beloved by the au­di­ence,” she says.</p>
    <p>“On the other hand, the rea­son they’re be­ing re­told is be­cause they’re great sto­ries or char­ac­ters. So it’s a sort of dou­ble-edged sword.”</p>
    <p>Both James and Ham­mer have found them­selves re­peat­edly cast in pe­riod pieces such as this one – which is set in 1930s Europe – through­out their ca­reers.</p>
    <p>“No­body has re­ally asked me to do con­tem­po­rary films, al­though I would love to,” says Ham­mer, who ap­peared in the ac­tion re­makes The Lone Ranger (2013) and The Man From U.N.C.L.E (2015).</p>
    <p>But many of these tales still res­onate to­day.</p>
    <p>James says: “These sto­ries set in the past of­ten have scale and ro­mance and an epic na­ture to them, and there’s a fas­ci­na­tion with want­ing to know what it was like and what the peo­ple were like in times gone by.</p>
    <p>“But it’s of­ten the same, and I think that’s why the story is still as rel­e­vant now as it was t hen. Peo­ple’s own in­ner de­mons and anx­i­eties and pres­sures are the same, and the ways men and women re­late to one another are pretty sim­i­lar.”</p>
    <p>She adds: “The pe­riod just gives a unique set­ting to a hu­man story.”</p>
    <p>Ham­mer agrees. “Even though peo­ple are talk­ing dif­fer­ently and wear­ing dif­fer­ent clothes from what we wear now, they’re deal­ing with the same is­sues we all deal with.</p>
    <p>“And if you don’t be­lieve me, ask your cur­rent part­ner about their ex and see how you feel about it.”</p>
    <p>The ac­tor points out that so­cial me­dia evokes the same in­vid­i­ous com­par­isons with others that plague James’ char­ac­ter – whose first name is never re­vealed – when she thinks of her hus­band’s first wife.</p>
    <p>He says: “What we are deal­ing with right now is peo­ple cre­at­ing a false re­al­ity that they hide be­hind. On so­cial me­dia, ev­ery­one’s life looks per­fect.</p>
    <p>“And this is what Lily’s char­ac­ter has done for Re­becca – cre­ate this false re­al­ity in her head where Re­becca and Maxim were so in love and happy to­gether, when the truth is pretty much the op­po­site.”</p>
    <p>It boils down to com­mu­ni­ca­tion. Ham­mer adds: “If she and Maxim knew how to com­mu­ni­cate well with each other, they would be able to fig­ure out a lot of their prob­lems.</p>
    <p>“But it’s bad com­mu­ni­ca­tion be­tween these two, and that’s some­thing peo­ple still strug­gle with.”</p>
