    <p>Sin­ga­porean Dil­preet Singh, who runs a tech­nol­ogy start-up in Mel­bourne, has been ex­er­cis­ing reg­u­larly and check­ing in more of­ten with his busi­ness team as he tries to keep spir­its up while liv­ing un­der lock­down in the Aus­tralian city.</p>
    <p>The 40-year-old, who has been in the cap­i­tal of Vic­to­ria state since 2012, said there is a lot of dis­ap­point­ment and anger at the lock­down against the coro­n­avirus pan­demic be­ing tight­ened and ex­tended for six weeks un­til Sept 13.</p>
    <p>It is the tough­est so far in Aus­tralia, and comes af­ter some peo­ple in­fected with Covid-19 were found not at home iso­lat­ing.</p>
    <p>“It is a pretty bad mood here on av­er­age. Most Aus­tralians have lis­tened to the gov­ern­ment, so the mood is one of huge dis­ap­point­ment at the sit­u­a­tion. There is a lot of anger and re­sent­ment at the few peo­ple who have spoilt it for the rest of us,” said Mr Singh.</p>
    <p>“I am per­son­ally do­ing okay – I am keep­ing up my run­ning rou­tine at the lo­cal sta­dium, in­ter­act­ing with my team a lot more to make sure ev­ery­one is fine,” he said.</p>
    <p>Un­der the tight­ened re­stric­tions in Mel­bourne, peo­ple have to ob­serve an 8pm to 5am cur­few and stay within 5km of their homes dur­ing the day. Only one per­son per house­hold can shop at a time once a day, while leav­ing the house to ex­er­cise is per­mit­ted for only one hour a day within a 5km radius.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh said that it has been dif­fi­cult to get hold of es­sen­tial items such as toi­let pa­per, bread and fruits in re­cent days.</p>
    <p>There is also worry about the eco­nomic im­pact and jobs. “There has been a lot of nega­tive news in terms of how busi­nesses are go­ing to fail, and sui­cides have been on the rise... I have not had to lay off any­one so far, and I am hop­ing to keep it that way.”</p>
    <p>Mr Singh said hav­ing com­mu­ni­ca­tion lim­ited to tele­con­fer­enc­ing via plat­forms such as Zoom has made it more dif­fi­cult to con­vince in­vestors to come on board. In June, his ap­pli­ca­tion for an ex­emp­tion to re­turn to Sin­ga­pore to seek in­vestors and raise funds for his busi­ness was re­jected.</p>
    <p>An­other Sin­ga­porean, first-year PhD stu­dent at Monash Univer­sity Regine Lau, has been away from home since Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>While the 26-year-old would have pre­ferred to re­turn home to wait out the pan­demic with her fam­ily and friends, she de­cided to re­main in Mel­bourne as there was some un­cer­tainty over when in­ter­na­tional stu­dents would be al­lowed back into Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>“Feel­ing home­sick is some­thing I have learnt to cope with, and FaceTime def­i­nitely helps. My fam­ily and friends had plans to visit me, but these had to be post­poned,” said Ms Lau, who is read­ing clin­i­cal neu­ropsy­chol­ogy.</p>
    <p>She said there was panic buy­ing ini­tially. “When I went gro­cery shop­ping on Sun­day... some peo­ple were panic buy­ing. They were buy­ing condi­ments and long-shelf-life milk by the dozens.”</p>
    <p>But when she made a sec­ond trip yes­ter­day, she did not en­counter any dif­fi­cul­ties, and there were still poul­try and pro­duce on the shelves.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent Paul Fal­zon, 46, has been in Mel­bourne since mid-June to help take care of his fa­ther, who suf­fered a heart at­tack.</p>
    <p>“I am do­ing long runs around the area, per­sonal high-in­ten­sity in­ter­val train­ing classes in the back­yard and yoga just to keep fit and sane. It is more ex­er­cise than I have ever done be­fore,” he said.</p>
    <p>He has also been call­ing his wife and nine-year-old daugh­ter, who are in Sin­ga­pore, two to three times a day.</p>
    <p>Mr Fal­zon said: “I just hope the sit­u­a­tion doesn’t get worse than it is. I want to get back to my fam­ily. I miss them a great deal.”</p>
