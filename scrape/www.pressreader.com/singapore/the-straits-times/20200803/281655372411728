    <p>Stu­dents from the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences (SUSS) are get­ting a leg-up in their work prospects amid a tough eco­nomic out­look this year.</p>
    <p>The univer­sity has been work­ing on ways to help fresh grad­u­ates who wish to ex­plore al­ter­na­tive job path­ways be­yond salaried po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>To this end, it started two pro­grammes in en­trepreneur­ship and the gig econ­omy for those who are in­ter­ested in such ar­eas of work.</p>
    <p>SUSS pres­i­dent Cheong Hee Kiat told The Straits Times in an in­ter­view last month that it is the in­sti­tu­tion’s way of pro­vid­ing some train­ing and sta­bil­ity as grad­u­ates pur­sue their in­ter­ests in this un­cer­tain Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>He said: “We need to en­cour­age more of th­ese young peo­ple with en­ergy, drive and ideas... to make a liv­ing on their own, and some of this will be in terms of en­trepreneur­ship.”</p>
    <p>The univer­sity’s ef­forts are on top of 100 trainee­ship po­si­tions it is of­fer­ing as part of the Gov­ern­ment’s SGUnited Trainee­ships Pro­gramme for re­cent grad­u­ates.</p>
    <p>It has re­ceived nearly 6,000 ap­pli­ca­tions for the po­si­tions, which come with a monthly al­lowance and some train­ing for up to 12 months.</p>
    <p>SUSS, Sin­ga­pore’s sixth au­ton­o­mous univer­sity, is cur­rently in the process of in­ter­view­ing ap­pli­cants.</p>
    <p>Since July 1, some of the po­si­tions have al­ready been filled, and eight trainees have started work across de­part­ments such as busi­ness in­tel­li­gence and an­a­lyt­ics, hu­man re­sources as well as com­mu­ni­ca­tions and mar­ket­ing.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Cheong said the univer­sity, which marks its 15th an­niver­sary this year, will train as­pir­ing en­trepreneur­s through a Ven­ture Builder pro­gramme which starts this month.</p>
    <p>Full-time and part-time SUSS grad­u­at­ing stu­dents who are el­i­gi­ble for SGUnited Trainee­ships can join the pro­gramme, which comes with a monthly al­lowance. It plans to start with 15 stu­dents, and eight have al­ready been re­cruited.</p>
    <p>It hopes to in­crease the in­take to 30 stu­dents next year if the scheme proves to be ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>The in­sti­tu­tion had pre­vi­ously in­tro­duced an Alibaba Cloud-SUSS En­trepreneur­ship Pro­gramme, an in­cu­ba­tion pro­gramme open to all in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing stu­dents, in­clud­ing those from out­side SUSS.</p>
    <p>Since 2017, it has helped to cre­ate about 35 stu­dent start-ups, 14 of which have se­cured fund­ing amount­ing to more than $8 mil­lion in to­tal.</p>
    <p>An­other ini­tia­tive is a se­ries of work­shops on the gig econ­omy that took place in June to equip grad­u­ates with skills re­lated to start­ing up busi­nesses. About 130 SUSS grad­u­ates at­tended the work­shops, which cov­ered top­ics such as free­lanc­ing, e-com­merce and dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing.</p>
    <p>Prof Cheong said it is not a given that young peo­ple know how to free­lance. “We want to train up a group of peo­ple whose men­tal model of what em­ploy­ment is about has en­larged,” he said.</p>
    <p>The univer­sity, he added, hopes to im­part to in­ter­ested stu­dents tips and tricks in the free­lance world, from how to find work op­por­tu­ni­ties and how to cre­ate con­tent to mar­ket­ing one’s abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>It may also bring such as­pects into its for­mal cur­ricu­lum to pre­pare grad­u­ates for new work regimes, said Prof Cheong.</p>
    <p>In a bid to broaden stu­dents’ ex­per­tise, SUSS has also grown its pool of mi­nor sub­jects, from fewer than five in 2005 to 38 now. The fields range from an­a­lyt­ics and dig­i­tal me­dia to psy­chol­ogy and so­ci­ol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Full-time un­der­grad­u­ates at SUSS, ex­cept those in ac­coun­tancy, need to take a mi­nor as part of their cur­ricu­lum. Part-time stu­dents have the op­tion of tak­ing a mi­nor if they wish to do so.</p>
    <p>Prof Cheong said it is es­sen­tial for stu­dents to have mul­ti­ple per­spec­tives, be open-minded and in­ter­act with peers from other dis­ci­plines who may not think like them.</p>
    <p>“What we are think­ing of is... to in­tro­duce more com­plex prob­lems in stu­dents’ se­cond and third-year cur­ric­ula, and com­bine stu­dents from dif­fer­ent dis­ci­plines for broad­based projects,” he added.</p>
    <p>Real-world is­sues are of­ten con­nected, he said. An is­sue in hous­ing, for ex­am­ple, could be linked to not just lo­gis­tics, but trans­port of goods and sup­ply dis­rup­tions, en­vi­ron­ment, pol­lu­tion and jobs.</p>
    <p>GO­ING BE­YOND SALARIED JOBS</p>
    <p>We need to en­cour­age more of th­ese young peo­ple with en­ergy, drive and ideas... to make a liv­ing on their own, and some of this will be in terms of ’’ en­trepreneur­ship.</p>
    <p>PRO­FES­SOR CHEONG HEE KIAT, pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences.</p>
