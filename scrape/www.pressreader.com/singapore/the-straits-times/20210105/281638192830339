    <p>The ter­mi­na­tion of the pro­posed high-speed rail project will not af­fect over­all plans for the Jurong Lake District (JLD), said Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He told Par­lia­ment that the Min­istry of Na­tional De­vel­op­ment had started plan­ning to trans­form Jurong as early as 2008, as part of a broader ef­fort to de­velop ur­ban cen­tres out­side the Cen­tral Busi­ness District.</p>
    <p>The plans for the JLD were there­fore de­vel­oped well be­fore Malaysia pro­posed the cur­rent HSR project, Mr Ong said.</p>
    <p>“It was only much later, in 2015, that we de­cided to lo­cate the Sin­ga­pore ter­mi­nus of the HSR in Jurong,” he noted in re­sponse to Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast GRC).</p>
    <p>“The ter­mi­na­tion of the HSR project, there­fore, does not af­fect the over­all im­pe­tus and vi­sion for JLD, al­though some de­tails may need to be ad­justed along the way.”</p>
    <p>Malaysia had al­lowed the HSR bi­lat­eral agree­ment to lapse on the dead­line of Dec 31 last year, af­ter both sides could not agree to changes it had pro­posed.</p>
    <p>Had the project gone through, it would have cut travel time be­tween Kuala Lumpur and Sin­ga­pore to 90 min­utes, down from about four to five hours by car.</p>
    <p>The ter­mi­nus sta­tion in Sin­ga­pore was to be con­structed in Jurong East, and would have been ac­ces­si­ble by four MRT lines.</p>
    <p>The sur­round­ing JLD was po­si­tioned, in 2017, as Sin­ga­pore’s fu­ture sec­ond Cen­tral Busi­ness District, with an am­bi­tious 20-year blue­print for com­mer­cial, hous­ing, na­ture and trans­port de­vel­op­ments, along with the po­ten­tial for cre­at­ing some 100,000 new jobs.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said yes­ter­day that when com­pleted, the JLD will be the largest com­mer­cial and re­gional cen­tre out­side of Sin­ga­pore’s city cen­tre.</p>
    <p>This would also bring busi­nesses and recre­ation op­por­tu­ni­ties to the area, he added.</p>
    <p>He said the land parcels that the Govern­ment has ac­quired are still needed to re­alise these plans.</p>
    <p>“We will be able to re­alise the full po­ten­tial of the land to ben­e­fit Sin­ga­pore­ans,” he added.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the Jurong Coun­try Club site will pro­vide for new mixed-use de­vel­op­ments and com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties, he said.</p>
    <p>In May 2015, the Govern­ment had gazetted the ac­qui­si­tion of the 67ha plot of land, which is lo­cated be­side Jurong Lake.</p>
    <p>It had planned to use close to 20 per cent of the land for the HSR ter­mi­nus.</p>
    <p>The re­main­der of the land was ear­marked to be trans­formed into a mixed-use de­vel­op­ment com­pris­ing of­fices, ho­tels, re­tail and res­i­dences.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Raf­fles Coun­try Club site – which spans about 143ha – is still needed for the Cross Is­land Line’s west­ern de­pot and the in­te­grated train-test­ing cen­tre, said Mr Ong.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment had gazetted the ac­qui­si­tion of the land, lo­cated near Tuas, in January 2017.</p>
    <p>It said then that the site was the most suit­able lo­ca­tion to run HSR tracks im­me­di­ately af­ter the bridge cross­ing from Jo­hor, among other uses.</p>
