    <p>Eight peo­ple were each is­sued with com­po­si­tion fines of $300 over the last two week­ends for fail­ing to com­ply with safe man­age­ment mea­sures while in Lit­tle In­dia.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have been step­ping up checks in the area in the peak pe­ri­ods lead­ing up to Deep­avali, which falls on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB), for one, has de­ployed more en­force­ment of­fi­cers and safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors to help with crowd man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>STB’s di­rec­tor for arts and cul­tural precincts, Ms Serene Tan, said shop­pers have also been ad­vised to stag­ger vis­its and avoid peak pe­ri­ods, such as week­ends, while shop­ping for Deep­avali.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times vis­ited Lit­tle In­dia over the past two week­ends and found that while crowd sizes were smaller com­pared with dur­ing the fes­tive pe­riod in pre­vi­ous years, busi­ness ap­peared brisk at the dif­fer­ent shops.</p>
    <p>Some stalls had also ex­tended their foot­print into the street to ac­com­mo­date the shop­pers.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors were seen pa­trolling the area to en­sure that shop­pers ad­hered to the re­quired mea­sures.</p>
    <p>While the streets of Lit­tle In­dia were set aglow last month dur­ing the Deep­avali light-up cer­e­mony, they are de­void of bazaars and fes­ti­val vil­lages this year.</p>
    <p>Mr Ra­jku­mar Chan­dra, pres­i­dent of the Lit­tle In­dia Shop­keep­ers and Her­itage As­so­ci­a­tion, said a small num­ber of stalls be­long­ing to ex­ist­ing shops have been al­lowed to set up at Camp­bell Lane. They have been re­minded to sell their goods only within their premises and at per­mit­ted ar­eas.</p>
    <p>The as­so­ci­a­tion also set up an on­line por­tal on lit­tlein­dia.com.sg, which went live on Oct 10, as well as its Face­book page for shops to sell fes­tive good­ies on­line.</p>
    <p>“Those who have been vendors at bazaars have ei­ther given this year a miss or have re­sorted to on­line op­tions. The on­line por­tal has helped many, but it can­not re­place the ex­pe­ri­ence of look­ing around and choos­ing items for them­selves,” added Mr Ra­jku­mar.</p>
    <p>Mr Iqbal Raja, who works at Bawa’s Del­i­cacy, a store sell­ing tra­di­tional cook­ies, sweets and mu­rukku, said that while over­all sales have been slow, the store has been gar­ner­ing more in­ter­est on­line since the out­break of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“Some still or­der on­line from us but oth­ers pre­fer to taste the snacks be­fore pur­chas­ing,” said the 49-year-old.</p>
    <p>The busi­ness, which has its main branch in Ker­bau Road, has a tem­po­rary stall in Camp­bell Lane.</p>
    <p>Over at Tekka Cen­tre, Mr Ven­gat­acha­lam Srini­vasa, who oc­ca­sion­ally helps out with his fam­ily’s busi­ness, Vanni’s Tai­lor­ing, said its rev­enue has fallen by around 20 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>But the busi­ness, which of­fers cus­tom-made Deep­avali out­fits, has been see­ing more de­mand for al­ter­ation ser­vices, as those who pur­chased ready-made out­fits on­line need to get them to fit, said the 36-year-old.</p>
    <p>Mr Gopalkr­ish­nan Ran­ganathan said he makes it a point to take his two boys to Lit­tle In­dia at least once a year around Deep­avali to ex­pe­ri­ence the fes­tive at­mos­phere.</p>
    <p>The 50-year-old engi­neer said: “This year’s am­bi­ence def­i­nitely isn’t there, es­pe­cially with much fewer stalls around. But when it comes to buy­ing our Deep­avali out­fits, try­ing out the dif­fer­ent foods, and get­ting or­na­ments and dec­o­ra­tions, we’ll still need to walk around and ex­pe­ri­ence this first-hand.”</p>
