    <p>As Sin­ga­pore and other coun­tries shifted school­ing on­line, one thing was ev­i­dent: Teach­ers rock.</p>
    <p>With­out fan­fare, ed­u­ca­tors adapted their class­room lessons for home-based learn­ing (HBL) for a na­tion of kids and youth.</p>
    <p>While HBL typ­i­cally com­prises a mix of on­line and off­line learn­ing, par­ents and their chil­dren had to learn how to tog­gle be­tween vir­tual plat­forms such as Stu­dent Learn­ing Space and Padlet walls. It be­came nor­mal to take pho­tos of your child’s school­work and post it on­line.</p>
    <p>“At school, you walk around so much meh?” was a sen­ti­ment mut­tered by many a par­ent work­ing from home, who mar­velled at teach­ers’ crowd con­trol skills.</p>
    <p>Par­ents dis­cov­ered that re­mote learn­ing for kids in­volves tak­ing fre­quent breaks to go to the toi­let, look for lost pen­cils, get a glass of wa­ter or travel aim­lessly from one room to an­other.</p>
    <p>Tu­ition and en­rich­ment classes also mi­grated on­line. Young­sters did HBL with af­ter-school op­tions such as vir­tual yoga or karate on Zoom.</p>
    <p>This brave new world came with chal­lenges as well as op­por­tu­ni­ties. Edutech is now a white-hot in­dus­try with im­pli­ca­tions for fu­ture jobs.</p>
    <p>At the same time, screen use has rock­eted, even among the preschool crowd. Af­ter years of ex­perts urg­ing re­straint when it comes to chil­dren’s screen time, some par­ents are won­der­ing what the new pa­ram­e­ters are.</p>
    <p>So­ci­ol­o­gists have pointed out that in­equal­i­ties are seen more clearly un­der Covid-19. Some chil­dren in low-in­come fam­i­lies found HBL dif­fi­cult, even when lap­tops were pro­vided by schools, the Gov­ern­ment and char­i­ta­ble groups.</p>
    <p>Do­ing school­work on a smart­phone is not easy. Nei­ther is fo­cus­ing on a thorny math­e­mat­ics prob­lem when shar­ing a small space with younger sib­lings who want to play.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pan­demic, HBL was oc­ca­sional. Af­ter go­ing full time dur­ing part of the cir­cuit breaker, the Gov­ern­ment an­nounced in June that HBL will be a reg­u­lar fea­ture, pos­si­bly held once a fort­night.</p>
    <p>While it is not a sub­sti­tute for school, on­line learn­ing is here to stay.</p>
