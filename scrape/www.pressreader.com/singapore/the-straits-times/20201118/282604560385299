    <p>TO­GETHER WE STAND, LIVE AGAIN!</p>
    <p>Ding Yi Mu­sic Com­pany</p>
    <p>Black Box, Stam­ford Arts Cen­tre Sun­day</p>
    <p>As Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ues to emerge from the cir­cuit breaker, Chi­nese in­stru­men­tal groups have been tak­ing the lead when it comes to live con­certs.</p>
    <p>First, it was the Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Orches­tra in Septem­ber and, now, Ding Yi Mu­sic Com­pany has given its first con­cert of the year.</p>
    <p>The 16-mem­ber en­sem­ble, led by Dedric Wong and Quek Ling Kiong, per­formed two con­certs fully masked, with wind play­ers se­questered be­hind screens, which re­sem­bled Covid-19 swab­bing sta­tions.</p>
    <p>The au­di­ence of 50 was di­vided into two blocs, one seated in a gallery, the other on­stage, sur­rounded on four sides by mu­si­cians and the con­duc­tor. This cre­ated a sur­round-sound at­mos­phere, which en­hanced the au­di­ence’s ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Ding Yi also stepped up au­di­ence in­ter­ac­tion through a pre-con­cert poll of works that they wanted to hear dur­ing the per­for­mance. The top votes went to Zai Na Yao Yuan De Di Fang (In That Dis­tant Place) and Dun Huang, both works with Cen­tral Asian in­flu­ences.</p>
    <p>The 75-minute pro­gramme was a light one, in­clud­ing pop­u­lar favourites of the reper­toire while re­main­ing cog­nisant of var­i­ous mu­si­cal ori­gins.</p>
    <p>The Can­tonese Han Tian Lei (Thun­der In Drought) opened the con­cert with a lively bang, bal­anced later by the more sen­ti­men­tal strains of the Hokkien song Wan Chun Feng (Spring Wind), with pipa and guzheng lov­ingly shar­ing the melody.</p>
    <p>Lo Le­ung Fai’s Med­ley Of Hakka Folk­songs high­lighted the suona and per­cus­sion, while al­ter­nat­ing be­tween the joy­ous and the re­flec­tive.</p>
    <p>The late Min Hui Fen’s ar­range­ment of Teochew favourite Winter Ducks Frolick­ing In The Wa­ter for erhu was sim­plic­ity it­self.</p>
    <p>With con­cert­mas­ter Chin Yen</p>
    <p>Choong’s solo and four per­cus­sion­ists, it be­gan slowly, but ended in a fast burst.</p>
    <p>Build­ing upon the theme of unity in crisis, Sin­ga­porean melodies such as Malay song Leng­gang Kangkung, Tamil hit Mun­naeru Vaal­ibaa and Eurasian-Por­tuguese love song Jinkly Nona were given slicked-up treatments. The au­di­ence was en­cour­aged to par­tic­i­pate with tam­bourines and jin­gles.</p>
    <p>Young l ocal com­poser Phang Kok Jun’s ar­range­ment of Na­tional Day Pa­rade song Our Sin­ga­pore pro­vided the ic­ing on the cake, though the t e mp t a t i o n to in­cor­po­rate Dick Lee’s over­played Home into the mix proved ir­re­sistible.</p>
    <p>The en­core was the world pre­miere of Cul­tural Medal­lion re­cip­i­ent Eric Wat­son’s To­gether We Stand. It lay­ered an os­ti­nato bass pro­vided by au­di­ence clap­ping with snatches of lo­cal songs such as Voices From The Heart and Di Tan­jong Ka­tong.</p>
    <p>The re­sult was a con­tra­pun­tal stew, a ver­i­ta­ble mu­si­cal ro­jak, but some­thing to proudly call Sin­ga­pore’s own.</p>
