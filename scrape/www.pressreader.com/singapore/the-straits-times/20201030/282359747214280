    <p>For­mer top Sin­ga­pore diplo­mat Bi­la­hari Kausikan yes­ter­day dis­missed claims that he is act­ing as an “agent” for a for­eign power, fol­low­ing an at­tack by a group claim­ing to be made up of re­tired and ac­tive Cam­bo­dian en­voys.</p>
    <p>They were hit­ting back at Mr Kausikan over re­marks he had made at a we­bi­nar last Fri­day, in which he ob­served that Cam­bo­dia and Laos are “tee­ter­ing pre­car­i­ously on the edge” of en­trust­ing their agency to an ex­ter­nal power or try­ing to be pas­sively neu­tral.</p>
    <p>In an un­signed open let­ter pub­lished on Tues­day on Cam­bo­dian pro-gov­ern­ment news web­site Fresh News Asia, whose owner openly sup­ports China, they crit­i­cised his “bar­rage of mis­lead­ing and flawed claims”. They fur­ther said that some re­gional coun­tries, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, “have pro­vided mil­i­tary bas­ing or leas­ing rights to ex­ter­nal pow­ers”.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Mr Kausikan said: “Be­ing (as they pointed out) ‘se­nile and for­get­ful’, I can­not re­mem­ber what this is about. But even my ad­dled wits can­not take se­ri­ously an ar­gu­ment that con­tains the phrase ‘Any­how, back to the sub­stance...’.”</p>
    <p>The for­mer per­ma­nent sec­re­tary at Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs added: “What were they say­ing be­fore? Non­sense? I can­not take this rub­bish se­ri­ously.”</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the we­bi­nar at the 35th Asean Round­table or­gan­ised by the ISEAS-Yu­sof Ishak In­sti­tute on Oct 23, he said that neu­tral­ity does not mean ly­ing low and hop­ing for the best. True neu­tral­ity, he added, means “know­ing your own in­ter­ests, tak­ing po­si­tions based on your own in­ter­ests and not al­low­ing oth­ers to de­fine your in­ter­ests for you by de­fault”.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the round­table, Mr Kausikan noted that Asean had for the first time failed to agree on a joint com­mu­nique in 2012, be­cause the then Cam­bo­dian for­eign min­is­ter re­fused any com­pro­mise on the South China Sea is­sue. China has over­lap­ping claims with sev­eral Asean mem­bers in the dis­puted wa­ter­way.</p>
    <p>He also noted that Cam­bo­dian Prime Min­is­ter Hun Sen later said sup­port­ing China was “Cam­bo­dia’s po­lit­i­cal choice”.</p>
    <p>“We are an in­ter-state and not a supra-na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tion,” said Mr Kausikan.</p>
    <p>“No mem­ber is re­quired to give up its sov­er­eign right to de­fine its na­tional in­ter­ests... What was at is­sue was whether Cam­bo­dia had in any de­gree taken the re­gional in­ter­est into ac­count when mak­ing that po­lit­i­cal choice.”</p>
    <p>He also said Asean may have to “cut loose the two (Cam­bo­dia and Laos) to save the eight (other mem­bers)”.</p>
    <p>His re­marks drew a sharp re­sponse from the writ­ers, who said it is con­tra­dic­tory for Mr Kausikan to pos­tu­late that Asean is an in­ter­state and not a supra-na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tion, while at the same time pro­mote the idea that some mem­ber states should be ex­pelled.</p>
    <p>They also crit­i­cised the in­sti­tute as a plat­form for “wolf war­riors” to push a nar­ra­tive that Cam­bo­dia is China’s vas­sal state.</p>
    <p>Cam­bo­dia is viewed by in­ter­na­tional an­a­lysts to be one of Bei­jing’s clos­est al­lies in South-east Asia. The term “wolf war­rior” is of­ten used to de­scribe ag­gres­sive moves by Chi­nese en­voys to de­fend Bei­jing’s na­tional in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>The in­sti­tute’s deputy di­rec­tor Ter­ence Chong told The Straits Times that as an in­de­pen­dent re­search cen­tre, it ex­am­ines longterm trends and chal­lenges fac­ing the re­gion. “To do so, we al­low in­di­vid­ual re­searchers and in­vited speak­ers the free­dom to give their own views and in­sights based on their anal­y­sis of the is­sues at hand.”</p>
