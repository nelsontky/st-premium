    <p>HAJI LANE</p>
    <p>A DAR­LING NEW RESTAU­RANT</p>
    <p>To trans­port your­self away from Sin­ga­pore, walk down Haji Lane at sun­set. The bo­hemian vibe, the out­door din­ing, the tempt­ing win­dow dis­plays in the shops all make for a very wel­come men­tal va­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Look for a restau­rant called Habibi-san!. It opened on Dec 1 and I can see my­self re­turn­ing again and again for chef Jonathan Lee’s gutsy, flavour­ful food.</p>
    <p>He has named his restau­rant per­fectly. Habibi is a term of en­dear­ment in Ara­bic – it means “dar­ling” and speaks to his years at Mid­dle East­ern-in­flected restau­rant Ar­ti­choke. The “san”, a Ja­panese hon­orific, comes from the Ja­panese ac­cents in his food. He cooks a lot of it over a Konro char­coal yak­i­tori grill from Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>One stand-out dish is Roasted Brus­sel Sprouts ($16), the veg­eta­bles charred and sweet from the grill, then tossed with roasted Ja­panese se­same paste, pick­led red cab­bage, jalapenos, and topped with bil­low­ing bonito flakes. That smoky sweet­ness is so com­pelling.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, Bur­rata Di Puglia ($15) boasts hay-smoked cherry to­ma­toes, which are what make the dish worth or­der­ing. Of course, there is noth­ing wrong with creamy bur­rata, basil oil, daikon salsa and the re­fresh­ing lilt of yuzu. But I am get­ting ahead of my­self.</p>
    <p>The mezzes are ter­rific: smoky Babaganous­h ($10) topped with crisp chicken skin; Men­taiko Tara­masalata ($13) with Men­taiko XO sauce folded into house­made lab­neh, a thick yo­gurt cheese, to­biko, crispy shal­lots and chives; and Pick­led Beet­root ($10), which gets kick from wasabi cream and – get this – wasabi pea fu­rikake. You can tell the 33-year-old chef is hav­ing fun. Mop these up with pil­lowy pita bread ($3 a piece).</p>
    <p>More ad­ven­tur­ous din­ers might want to or­der the Hon­ey­comb Beef</p>
    <p>Tripe ($13), topped with gre­mo­lata made with pre­served olive leaves.</p>
    <p>The smoky skew­ers are per­fect with cock­tails from Bar Sto­ries, which shares the premises. Owner Dave Koh, 40, bonded with chef Lee through fish­ing and there are no bound­aries be­tween bar and restau­rant. Cus­tomised cock­tails make so much sense and I had sev­eral al­co­hol-free ones with my meal.</p>
    <p>I am happy to nib­ble all night long, but there is a main course I love – Snap­per Sarma ($28). The line-caught fish from New Zealand is wrapped in ice­berg let­tuce and is ten­der af­ter cook­ing. Miso but­ter, yuzu beurre blanc and chives sup­ply creami­ness, with shaved fen­nel and a green ap­ple salad pro­vid­ing crunch.</p>
    <p>The best way to sam­ple the menu is to leave it to the chef and opt for the Feeeeed Me meal, which costs $58 a per­son for seven cour­ses. For a more sub­stan­tial meal, there is a $78 op­tion with two to three more dishes. Make a re­quest when you book.</p>
