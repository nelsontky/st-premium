    <p>Un­happy with how his son-in-law had treated his daugh­ter and be­liev­ing that it was part of a plan to cheat him of his busi­ness, a semi-re­tired busi­ness­man re­peat­edly stabbed the younger man in front of a lunchtime crowd.</p>
    <p>While wait­ing for the po­lice to ar­rive, Tan Nam Seng phoned his daugh­ter to tell her what he had done.</p>
    <p>“I can’t sleep at night. I have done it. I have killed him. Don’t cry. I am old al­ready. I am not scared (of) go­ing to jail,” he told her.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Tan, 72, pleaded guilty to a re­duced charge of cul­pa­ble homi­cide for stab­bing 39-year-old Mr Spencer Tup­pani in the chest three times out­side a Telok Ayer</p>
    <p>Street cof­fee shop at about 1.20pm on July 10, 2017.</p>
    <p>Closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion footage was played in court show­ing Tan at­tack­ing Mr Tup­pani, who was with three friends at the cof­fee shop.</p>
    <p>Footage was also shown of Mr Tup­pani run­ning away and col­laps­ing in front of a restau­rant in Boon Tat Street.</p>
    <p>Tan was seen in the footage kick­ing Mr Tup­pani twice in the face and chas­ing passers-by away.</p>
    <p>Tan was orig­i­nally charged with mur­der but the charge was re­duced after he was found to be suf­fer­ing from a ma­jor de­pres­sive dis­or­der.</p>
    <p>His con­di­tion, which in­cluded “over­whelm­ing ru­mi­na­tions and wor­ries about the well-be­ing of his daugh­ters”, im­paired his men­tal re­spon­si­bil­ity for his ac­tions, said an In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health re­port.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Tan founded TNS Ship­ping in 1974, and the busi­ness grew into var­i­ous com­pa­nies over the years.</p>
    <p>His three daugh­ters worked for the busi­ness, and so did Mr Tup­pani after he mar­ried Tan’s el­dest daugh­ter Shyller in 2005.</p>
    <p>The com­pa­nies were later con­sol­i­dated into TNS Ocean Lines.</p>
    <p>In 2016, the com­pany was sold to a big­ger cor­po­ra­tion and Mr Tup­pani be­came the chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of the new com­pany. Mr Tup­pani, who pro­posed the deal, per­suaded his fa­ther-in-law and wife to as­sign their shares to him so as to boost his stake in the com­pany.</p>
    <p>Tan re­ceived $450,000 from the sale of his shares. “He was un­happy with the amount as he ex­pected to re­ceive more,” Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Lim Jian Yi told the court.</p>
    <p>In early 2017, Ms Tan found out that Mr Tup­pani was hav­ing an af­fair with an­other woman, with whom he had two chil­dren.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple agreed to a divorce but fre­quently quar­relled over is­sues such as the cus­tody of their three chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Tan found out Mr Tup­pani was record­ing the ar­gu­ments and sus­pected that he planned to use the record­ings in divorce pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>On July 4, 2017, Tan’s younger daugh­ter Sherry was sus­pended from the com­pany fol­low­ing a dis­pute with Mr Tup­pani’s per­sonal as­sis­tant. This trou­bled Tan, who be­lieved his el­dest daugh­ter could be re­moved as well. He be­lieved that Mr Tup­pani planned to cheat him of his busi­ness by di­vorc­ing his daugh­ter after tak­ing con­trol of all their shares.</p>
    <p>Tan ar­ranged to meet Mr Tup­pani to dis­cuss the suspension and felt dis­re­spected when the younger man can­celled the meet­ing.</p>
    <p>On July 10, 2017, Tan was on the way to the of­fice at Ce­cil Court when he saw Mr Tup­pani at Telok Ayer Street. When he reached his of­fice, Tan went to the pantry to look for a knife, and then headed to the cof­fee shop.</p>
    <p>At about 1.20pm, he told Mr Tup­pani “you are too much” in Hokkien, pulled the knife out of his sling bag and stabbed the younger man.</p>
    <p>After Mr Tup­pani col­lapsed at Boon Tat Street, Tan told passersby: “This is my son-in-law, don’t help him, let him die.”</p>
    <p>He then placed the blood­ied knife on a ta­ble be­side him and calmly sat on a nearby chair.</p>
    <p>When Ms Shyller Tan cried over the phone after hear­ing what he had done, he told her: “What’s done can­not be un­done.”</p>
    <p>The case was ad­journed for sen­tenc­ing ar­gu­ments.</p>
    <p>The max­i­mum sen­tence for cul­pa­ble homi­cide is life im­pris­on­ment and can­ing. Tan can­not be caned as he is above the age of 50.</p>
    <p>WHAT HE TOLD DAUGH­TER</p>
    <p>I can’t sleep at night. I have done it. I have killed him. Don’t cry. I am old al­ready. I am not scared (of) go­ing to jail.</p>
