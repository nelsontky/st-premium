    <p>Pri­vate-hire driver Adrian Ong, 35, has been work­ing three to four hours more ev­ery day to make up for the slower busi­ness of the last few months, but his earn­ings are still about 60 per cent of what they were be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The drop in in­come has been par­tially cov­ered by pay­outs from schemes to help work­ers, such as the Self-Em­ployed Per­son In­come Re­lief Scheme (Sirs), which pro­vided self-em­ployed peo­ple with three quar­terly cash pay­outs of $3,000 each.</p>
    <p>But with Sirs end­ing this year, driv­ers like Mr Ong have been hop­ing for some form of ex­tra help.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Ong, who is sin­gle: “Any form of sup­port or as­sis­tance is def­i­nitely wel­come, re­gard­less of the amount.</p>
    <p>“Sirs was def­i­nitely help­ful to tide us over the ini­tial dif­fi­cult months, but I guess we can’t ex­pect such as­sis­tance to be long-last­ing as we tran­si­tion to nor­malcy.”</p>
    <p>He was among those who wel­comed the news yes­ter­day that driv­ers in the point-to-point (P2P) trans­port sec­tor will get a higher amount of grants to off­set their ve­hi­cle rental fees from next year.</p>
    <p>The Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA) said the move will help cush­ion the im­pact of Sirs end­ing.</p>
    <p>Main taxi hir­ers and full-time pri­vate-hire driv­ers in the P2P trans­port sec­tor will get $600 per ve­hi­cle each month be­tween Jan­uary and March next year, up from $300.</p>
    <p>This will be re­duced to $450 a month be­tween April and June.</p>
    <p>The LTA said that the Covid-19 Driver Re­lief Fund will cost $133 mil­lion. It re­places the Spe­cial Re­lief Fund, through which P2P driv­ers have been re­ceiv­ing pay­outs since Fe­bru­ary. About 52,000 driv­ers el­i­gi­ble for the Spe­cial Re­lief Fund will be au­to­mat­i­cally moved to the new fund next month.</p>
    <p>The to­tal as­sis­tance set aside for the sec­tor now stands at about $380 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>P2P driv­ers who re­ceive the pay­outs un­der the new fund will not be el­i­gi­ble for the Covid-19 Re­cov­ery Grant for lower- to mid­dle-in­come work­ers an­nounced by the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In ex­plain­ing the con­tin­ued pay­outs for driv­ers, the LTA said: “De­spite the im­prov­ing Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in Sin­ga­pore, taxi and pri­vate-hire car rid­er­ship re­mains lower than pre-Covid-19 lev­els as tourism ac­tiv­i­ties re­main muted and many em­ploy­ees are still work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 has also changed com­mut­ing pat­terns, with shorter taxi and pri­vate-hire car trips, which re­sult in lower fares per trip.”</p>
    <p>De­spite the im­prov­ing Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in Sin­ga­pore, taxi and pri­vate-hire car rid­er­ship re­mains lower than pre-Covid-19 lev­els as tourism ac­tiv­i­ties re­main muted and many em­ploy­ees are still work­ing from home. Covid-19 has also changed com­mut­ing pat­terns, with shorter taxi and pri­vate-hire car trips, which re­sult in lower fares per trip.</p>
    <p>THE LAND TRANS­PORT AU­THOR­ITY, in ex­plain­ing the con­tin­ued pay­outs.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­ity said in an up­date last month that rid­er­ship for taxi and pri­vate-hire cars was still at 75 per cent of pre-Covid-19 lev­els.</p>
    <p>But this fig­ure is on the higher end of es­ti­mates made by driv­ers and taxi com­pa­nies, who have said that rid­er­ship is slightly above 66 per cent of pre-out­break lev­els.</p>
    <p>Grab driver Alex Yap, 28, said: “Tourists are im­por­tant cus­tomers for us, and with­out them, rid­er­ship is still not as good as be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>He hopes there can be a one­time pay­ment to fur­ther sup­port self-em­ployed work­ers.</p>
    <p>An­other pri­vate-hire driver, Mr Wil­liam Lim, 43, said he hopes that there will not be fur­ther in­creases in rental or com­mis­sion fees in the near fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Trans­port Amy Khor said in a Face­book post yes­ter­day that she has met rep­re­sen­ta­tives of the Na­tional Taxi As­so­ci­a­tion (NTA) and the Na­tional Pri­vate Hire Ve­hi­cles As­so­ci­a­tion (NPHVA) to un­der­stand their con­cerns. She added that she has “as­sured them that we will con­tinue to sup­port them in what­ever way we can”.</p>
    <p>NTA and NPHVA said in a joint state­ment they were thank­ful for the lat­est sup­port mea­sures.</p>
    <p>They also said they have helped about 13,000 driv­ers ap­ply for the NTUC Care Fund (Covid-19) since it was launched in March. The fund pro­vides pay­outs of up to $300 for hard-hit union mem­bers.</p>
