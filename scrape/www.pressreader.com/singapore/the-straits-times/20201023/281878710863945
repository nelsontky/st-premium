    <p>The de­bate over a min­i­mum wage, one of the most fre­quently dis­cussed top­ics in pol­icy cir­cles, flared up again last week in Par­lia­ment and on so­cial me­dia. The Work­ers’ Party has pushed for a na­tional min­i­mum wage of $1,300 a month, while Na­tional Trades Union Congress rep­re­sen­ta­tives re­it­er­ated their long-held view that such a min­i­mum wage would be un­work­able and that the pro­gres­sive wage model in use here is a bet­ter op­tion. Economists have long de­bated the mer­its of a min­i­mum wage. Its pro­po­nents point out that it would re­duce poverty and in­equal­ity, raise house­hold spend­ing, and curb de­pen­dence on govern­ment ben­e­fits. Op­po­nents say it can in­crease un­em­ploy­ment, raise costs, en­cour­age out­sourc­ing and lead to older work­ers be­ing re­placed by younger ones.</p>
    <p>Both sides present ev­i­dence to sup­port their views. While there is lit­tle point in be­ing ide­o­log­i­cally op­posed to the idea of a min­i­mum wage, some prac­ti­cal con­sid­er­a­tions war­rant at­ten­tion. One is that un­like the pro­gres­sive wage model, it is not linked to skill lev­els. This raises the ques­tion of whether bosses would con­sider a min­i­mum wage to be jus­ti­fied in the case of un­skilled work­ers. Re­lated to this is a sec­ond con­sid­er­a­tion: Any min­i­mum wage pol­icy will need the buy-in of em­ploy­ers and unions in Sin­ga­pore’s tri­par­tite sys­tem. So far, this has proved dif­fi­cult to ob­tain, even though the idea has been re­peat­edly ad­vo­cated since the Na­tional Wages Coun­cil was es­tab­lished in 1972, in­clud­ing by its first chair­man Lim Chong Yah.</p>
    <p>Third, even if ar­gu­ments for a min­i­mum wage pol­icy were ac­cepted, the ques­tion is whether it is ap­pro­pri­ate in a sit­u­a­tion of re­ces­sion and mount­ing job losses. The one-size-fits-all char­ac­ter­is­tic of the min­i­mum wage would be es­pe­cially prob­lem­atic in the cur­rent K-shaped eco­nomic tra­jec­tory, where ar­eas such as elec­tron­ics, IT ser­vices, e-com­merce and the bio­med­i­cal sec­tor are thriv­ing – in some cases, do­ing even bet­ter than dur­ing the pre-Covid-19 era – while oth­ers such as avi­a­tion, hos­pi­tal­ity, constructi­on and off­line re­tail are strug­gling to sur­vive. A case could be made that em­ploy­ers in the for­mer group should be re­quired to pay more than the min­i­mum wage, while those in the lat­ter group – where many re­trench­ments oc­cur – should get a re­prieve. But then there would be no na­tional min­i­mum wage pol­icy. So while the idea should not be dis­missed, it should be re­vis­ited after the econ­omy sta­bilises and starts to grow again. Ideally, it should be ac­com­pa­nied by some form of au­to­matic sup­port for the un­em­ployed be­cause, even as many of its pro­po­nents con­cede, un­em­ploy­ment is a pos­si­ble side ef­fect of a min­i­mum wage, not­with­stand­ing its other ben­e­fits. The min­i­mum wage is an idea whose time may come. But Sin­ga­pore and the econ­omy are now in a ma­jor cri­sis. Rather than ide­o­log­i­cal dis­putes, the fo­cus today must be on rid­ing out and re­cov­er­ing from the storm.</p>
