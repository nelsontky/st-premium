    <p>Beauty and well­ness firm Mary Chia Hold­ings has en­tered into a sale and pur­chase agree­ment to buy an 80 per cent stake in five com­pa­nies un­der the Mon­soon Hair­dress­ing group for about $3 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The seller is Lee Eng Tat, or Addy Lee, a celebrity hair­styl­ist and the founder of Mon­soon, the Catal­istlisted firm an­nounced on Tues­day night. The tar­get com­pa­nies are pri­mar­ily in the busi­ness of pro­vid­ing hair ser­vices and hair care prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Half of the con­sid­er­a­tion for the deal will be paid in cash. The re­main­der will be sat­is­fied by the is­suance of new shares in the com­pany sub­ject to cer­tain con­di­tions, Mary Chia said.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, the firm on Tues­day also an­nounced that it has en­tered into a sub­scrip­tion agree­ment with I Con­cept Global Growth Fund that will raise $800,000 to par­tially fund the pro­posed stake pur­chase in Mon­soon Hair­dress­ing.</p>
    <p>The subscriber has agreed to take on about 5.6 mil­lion new shares in Mary Chia at an is­sue price of 14.4 cents. The is­sue price rep­re­sents a 10 per cent dis­count from the counter’s vol­ume-weighted av­er­age price of 16 cents on Sept 22, be­ing the last full mar­ket day prior to the date of the sub­scrip­tion agree­ment.</p>
    <p>I Con­cept Global Growth Fund’s sole share­holder is Mr Michael Liew, who is pur­chas­ing the shares “purely for in­vest­ment pur­poses”, with no in­ten­tion of in­flu­enc­ing the firm’s man­age­ment or ex­er­cis­ing con­trol over the com­pany, Mary Chia said. Mr Liew was in­tro­duced to Mary Chia by a sub­stan­tial share­holder of the firm.</p>
    <p>He has also agreed to pro­vide ad­di­tional funds of $600,000 to Mary Chia by no later than March 31 next year, the terms of which will be set in a sub­se­quent sub­scrip­tion agree­ment, the firm said.</p>
    <p>In ac­count­ing for the pro­posed ac­qui­si­tion, Mary Chia said the tar­get com­pa­nies are com­ple­men­tary to the group’s cur­rent beauty and well­ness of­fer­ings.</p>
    <p>The com­pany in­tends to cross-sell prod­ucts to cus­tomers, pro­vid­ing them with a wider va­ri­ety of prod­ucts and ser­vices. It added that the pro­posed ac­qui­si­tion could lead to cost sav­ings from joint re­sources and pos­si­bly the shar­ing of premises, which con­sti­tute a ma­jor part of to­tal op­er­at­ing costs.</p>
    <p>Mary Chia chair­man and chief ex­ec­u­tive Wendy Ho said the group will be able to achieve greater economies of scale with the pro­posed merger.</p>
    <p>“More im­por­tantly, Mary Chia will be able to lever­age Addy’s es­tab­lished over­seas pres­ence, par­tic­u­larly in China, to ex­pand our reach in the Chi­nese mar­ket swiftly,” she added.</p>
