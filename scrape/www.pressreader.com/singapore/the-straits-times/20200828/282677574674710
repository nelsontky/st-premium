    <p>LON­DON • The hopes of Hol­ly­wood were rid­ing on the open­ing of Tenet on Wed­nes­day, as the Christophe­r Nolan spy thriller tests movie fans’ ap­petite to re­turn to cine­mas and res­cue an in­dus­try ham­mered by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The big­gest re­lease since sched­ules were torn up in March – and the only one of the year’s po­ten­tial sum­mer block­busters to make it to the big screen in the hol­i­day sea­son – Tenet launched in 70 coun­tries on Wed­nes­day, ahead of the United States next week.</p>
    <p>The movie has al­ready won over some crit­ics, but fans could be a harder sell, given the changes to the moviego­ing ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Ac­tor Tom Cruise, whose Top Gun: Mav­er­ick was pulled from a re­lease ear­lier this sum­mer, donned a face mask to at­tend a pre­view of Tenet in Lon­don.</p>
    <p>“Great to be back in a movie theatre, ev­ery­body,” he said on Tues­day. “I loved it.”</p>
    <p>Film critic Kaleem Aftab said Tenet – which re­port­edly cost AT&T’s Warner Bros more than US$200 mil­lion (S$273 mil­lion) to make – was ex­actly the kind of film the in­dus­try needed.</p>
    <p>“Tenet is an in­tel­li­gent block­buster made with loads of money, with big ex­plo­sions and big bangs, ex­actly what we’d expect from Christophe­r Nolan, who made films like In­ter­stel­lar, In­cep­tion and Dunkirk,” he said.</p>
    <p>Aftab added that movie the­atres are where the money is made.</p>
    <p>“If Tenet is a suc­cess, we’re go­ing to see a quick rush of re­leases; we’ll see Bond come out for sure in Novem­ber. The worry is if Tenet is a flop, they’ll de­cide to wait un­til next sum­mer,” he said.</p>
    <p>While cine­mas have ten­ta­tively re­opened around the world, they have mainly re­lied on clas­sics to test pan­demic-proof mea­sures, along with a few new re­leases such as Rus­sell Crowe’s thriller Un­hinged.</p>
    <p>Other films will go straight to stream­ing plat­forms, most notably Dis­ney’s Mu­lan.</p>
    <p>Ma­jor UK cinema chain Cineworld, which owns Re­gal in the United States and Cinema City in Europe, said it was pleased by pre-re­lease book­ings for Tenet, which were track­ing at a sim­i­lar level to that of a block­buster re­leased be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We hope that it helps to re­store con­fi­dence in at­tend­ing the cinema ahead of other high-pro­file re­leases later this year, in­clud­ing the lat­est Bond, Won­der Woman 1984, Black Wi­dow and A Quiet Place 2,” a spokesman said.</p>
