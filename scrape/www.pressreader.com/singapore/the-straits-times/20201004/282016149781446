    <p>ROME A fire­man died and 19 peo­ple were miss­ing in France and Italy after a storm hit bor­der re­gions of the two coun­tries, caus­ing heavy flood­ing that swept away roads and dam­aged homes, the au­thor­i­ties said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The storm, dubbed Alex, rav­aged sev­eral vil­lages around the city of Nice on the French Riviera.</p>
    <p>Nice Mayor Chris­tian Estrosi called it the worst flood­ing dis­as­ter in the area for more than a cen­tury after fly­ing over the worst-hit area by he­li­copter. “The roads and about 100 houses were swept away or par­tially de­stroyed,” he told French news chan­nel BFM.</p>
    <p>At least eight peo­ple were miss­ing in France, the au­thor­i­ties said. These in­cluded two fire­men whose ve­hi­cle was car­ried away by a swollen river, ac­cord­ing to lo­cal wit­nesses cited by French me­dia.</p>
    <p>In Italy, at least one per­son died and up to 11 peo­ple were miss­ing, the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties said. A fire­man was killed by a fall­ing tree in the Valle d’Aosta re­gion, while three peo­ple trav­el­ling in a van were swept away by flood wa­ters in Val Roya, on the bor­der with France.</p>
    <p>Six Ger­man trekkers were among the miss­ing after fail­ing to re­turn from a trip in the moun­tains in the prov­ince of Cu­neo.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials in Italy’s Pied­mont re­gion re­ported a record 630mm of rain in just 24 hours in Sam­bughetto, close to the bor­der with Switzer­land. Pied­mont re­gional chief Al­berto Cirio called on the gov­ern­ment to de­clare a state of emer­gency.</p>
    <p>Mr Eric Ciotti, a mem­ber of the French Par­lia­ment who is from one of the worst-af­fected vil­lages in the area, Saint-Martin-Ve­subie, said sev­eral vil­lages were cut off as they are lo­cated in steep-sided val­leys of the moun­tain­ous re­gion.</p>
    <p>Me­teo France said that 450mm of rain was reg­is­tered over 24 hours in some ar­eas – the equiv­a­lent of close to four months of rain at this time of the year.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Saint-Martin-Ve&#xAD;subie is among the vil&#xAD;lages in south-east&#xAD;ern France bat&#xAD;tered by a storm that hit bor&#xAD;der re&#xAD;gions of France and Italy. Heavy floods caused by the storm swept away roads and dam&#xAD;aged homes. Me&#xAD;teo France said the equiv&#xAD;a&#xAD;lent of nearly four months of rain at this time of year was recorded over 24 hours in some ar&#xAD;eas.</p>
