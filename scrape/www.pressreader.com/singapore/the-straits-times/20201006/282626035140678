    <p>FANS URGE NG MAN TAT TO EAT MORE: Vet­eran Hong Kong ac­tor Ng Man Tat is known for his hi­lar­i­ous turns in sev­eral Stephen Chow movies such as All For The Win­ner (1990), Fight Back To School (1991) and Justice, My Foot! (1992).</p>
    <p>But some fans are frown­ing over a re­cent photo which raised ques­tions about the 68-year-old’s health.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, Chi­nese ac­tor Shi Xiaolong, 32, posted on Weibo a photo of him­self with Ng (both left) with the cap­tion: “Happy Mid-Au­tumn Fes­ti­val, Un­cle Tat”.</p>
    <p>Ng looked vis­i­bly thin in the photo, though his pot belly was vis­i­ble.</p>
    <p>Shi, a for­mer child star, had acted with Ng in the 1994 com­edy movie Shaolin Popey II: Messy Tem­ple.</p>
    <p>Some fans com­mented that the photo re­minded them of their younger years in the 1990s; oth­ers urged Ng to take care of his health and to eat more to gain weight.</p>
    <p>Last year, Shi posted on so­cial me­dia a photo of him­self with Ng, who looked to be in good spir­its even though he sported white hair and a beard.</p>
    <p>In 2014, Ng was warded in the in­ten­sive care unit due to heart fail­ure from a vi­ral in­fec­tion and lost 38kg as a re­sult. He also suf­fers from di­a­betes and has re­duced his work­load in re­cent years.</p>
