    <p>She may be a ti­tan in the lit­er­ary world, but Cana­dian au­thor Mar­garet At­wood would pre­fer not to be called an icon.</p>
    <p>“Icons are gen­er­ally made of wood and have mean­ing as­cribed to them by other peo­ple, and typ­i­cally dur­ing pe­ri­ods of icon­o­clasm, they get burnt up in fires,” she said in a vir­tual di­a­logue on Tues­day dur­ing the Sin­ga­pore Writ­ers Fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>Her 2019 novel The Tes­ta­ments opens with a statue be­ing erected, as its sub­ject quips: “Al­ready I am pet­ri­fied.”</p>
    <p>“The his­tory of stat­ues is pretty in­struc­tive,” ob­served At­wood, 80.</p>
    <p>When she was writ­ing The Tes­ta­ments, the Booker Prize-win­ning se­quel to her sem­i­nal 1985 novel The Hand­maid’s Tale, the pulling down of stat­ues had yet to oc­cupy the head­lines, as it did this year when peo­ple around the world be­gan top­pling the stat­ues of slave traders and colonis­ers.</p>
    <p>“That’s what it is to be an icon: You get a statue made of you, which then falls into dis­re­pute and can eas­ily be top­pled. It’s so much nicer not to be on a pedestal – much more free­dom of move­ment.”</p>
    <p>At­wood is one of a record 10 head­lin­ers at the fes­ti­val, which is or­gan­ised by the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil and runs un­til Sun­day in its first fully dig­i­tal edi­tion with more than 200 pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>Over 1½ hours, the grande dame of dystopia ban­tered with moder­a­tor Balli Kaur Jaswal and gamely an­swered ques­tions from view­ers, from her de­gree of in­volve­ment in The Hand­maid’s Tale television adap­ta­tion (2017 to present) to the shade of lip­stick she was wear­ing.</p>
    <p>At­wood’s nov­els of­ten feel dis­turbingly pre­scient, from the ero­sion of women’s rights in The Hand­maid’s Tale to the vi­ral pan­demic of the Mad­dAd­dam tril­ogy (2003 to 2013).</p>
    <p>On the eve of a tur­bu­lent United States pres­i­den­tial election in the midst of the Covid-19 out­break, she and Jaswal dis­cussed struc­tures of power.</p>
    <p>“As I was born in 1939, I was a child in World War II and I’ve al­ways been pretty fas­ci­nated by dic­ta­tor­ships,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Part of The Hand­maid’s Tale came from, ‘ What if the United States were to have to­tal­i­tar­i­an­ism?’ And we’ve come wor­ry­ingly close to know­ing the an­swer to that in real life.”</p>
    <p>At­wood is con­cerned about how the “ex­treme right have kid­napped free speech”, re­vers­ing a pre­vi­ous po­si­tion in which free speech was con­sid­ered a left­ist ideal and align­ing the left with cen­sor­ship in­stead. “The cen­tre has to reaf­firm the right to rea­son­able dis­course,” she said.</p>
    <p>She was among the sig­na­to­ries of a con­tro­ver­sial open let­ter pub­lished in Harper’s mag­a­zine in July this year, which ar­gued that the spread of “cen­so­ri­ous­ness” is leading to an “in­tol­er­ance of op­pos­ing views”.</p>
    <p>“It has to be ad­dressed, or peo­ple who oth­er­wise would share com­mon aims start can­ni­bal­is­ing one another, and they, in the rush to prove ‘Mir­ror, mir­ror on the wall, who is the most right­eous, pure and woke of all?’, send Snow White off into the woods to get her heart cut out. ”</p>
    <p>At­wood is re­leas­ing her first po­etry col­lec­tion in more than a decade, Dearly, later this month. “More gloom and weird­ness,” she joked.</p>
    <p>Some are “the kind of po­ems you can write when you’re 80 but not 25, when you’re not ac­tu­ally able to pic­ture a long span of time”, while oth­ers are about “zom­bies, were­wolves, sirens and aliens”.</p>
    <p>She re­mains “re­al­is­ti­cally hope­ful” for the fu­ture be­yond the pan­demic. “We will get to the other side.”</p>
    <p>Icons are gen­er­ally made of wood and have mean­ing as­cribed to them by other peo­ple, and typ­i­cally dur­ing pe­ri­ods of icon­o­clasm, they get burnt up in fires.</p>
