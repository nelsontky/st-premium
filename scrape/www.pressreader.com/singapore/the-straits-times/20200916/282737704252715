    <p>Here’s a likely sce­nario: You’re mul­ti­task­ing on your com­puter and have opened a few tabs in incog­nito, or pri­vate, mode.</p>
    <p>In one tab, you’re chat­ting with your rel­a­tives. In an­other three, you’re com­par­ing the prices of shoes. Mean­while, the online game you’re play­ing with friends is pop­ping up and prompt­ing you to make your move.</p>
    <p>While do­ing all this, you spot a pair of shoes you fancy at $50 and click on the “buy” icon in your browser, which opens an­other tab for you to fill in your credit card de­tails. Just then, your game tab springs up again. A cou­ple of min­utes later, you get an au­to­mated SMS say­ing your credit card has been deb­ited for $5,000 – for buy­ing points in an ob­scure game you have never played.</p>
    <p>What just hap­pened? You have be­come a vic­tim of a “man-in-the-middle” (MITM) attack, which oc­curs when a hacker se­cretly re­lays and al­ters the com­mu­ni­ca­tions be­tween two par­ties who be­lieve they are di­rectly com­mu­ni­cat­ing with each other.</p>
    <p>The attacker may be eaves­drop­ping on your con­ver­sa­tions or brows­ing ses­sions and can take over the con­ver­sa­tion with­out your knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>But how can this hap­pen in incog­nito mode? Isn’t it sup­posed to be se­cure and pri­vate?</p>
    <p>It is – to an ex­tent and if you take pre­cau­tions. Many peo­ple as­sume this mode pro­vides com­plete pri­vacy; this is false.</p>
    <p>While brows­ing in incog­nito mode pre­vents browsers from stor­ing cook­ies, brows­ing his­tory and pass­words, your In­ter­net ser­vice provider (ISP) can still see and log ev­ery site you visit.</p>
    <p>The rea­son ISPs au­to­mat­i­cally log Web brows­ing ac­tiv­i­ties – whether you’re brows­ing in incog­nito mode or not – is to make the data avail­able to law en­force­ment if re­quired.</p>
    <p>More­over, as you may have no­ticed, al­most ev­ery web­site you visit asks you to click on an “ac­cept cook­ies” op­tion to ac­cess its con­tent. Do­ing so pro­vides your In­ter­net Pro­to­col ad­dress – which is your de­fault iden­ti­fier online – to both the web­site and your ISP.</p>
    <p>The MITM attack likely hap­pened when you ac­cepted cook­ies in one of the pop-ups that ap­peared while you were shop­ping or gam­ing.</p>
    <p>Still, it’s a good idea to use your browser in incog­nito mode, be­cause it keeps you safe from cook­ies and pop-ups. Here’s what you can ex­pect when you browse in the incog­nito or pri­vate modes of the four most pop­u­lar Web browsers.</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>GOOGLE CHROME</p>
    <p>Press the Con­trol-Shift-N keys si­mul­ta­ne­ously while us­ing Google Chrome to launch Chrome in incog­nito mode.</p>
    <p>This mode helps pro­tect your pri­vacy, es­pe­cially when you’re us­ing a shared com­puter.</p>
    <p>The web­sites you visit – whether you find them through a search en­gine or by typ­ing in their ad­dresses – will not stay in the browser his­tory. All cook­ies cre­ated will be deleted when you exit the browser.</p>
    <p>Cook­ies are not shared be­tween reg­u­lar and incog­nito win­dows in Chrome, so you can use the incog­nito win­dow to log in to a web­site with­out log­ging out of ones al­ready opened in reg­u­lar win­dows.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, you could open an incog­nito win­dow and check your work Gmail ac­count while still logged in to your per­sonal ac­count in a reg­u­lar win­dow, and view your Face­book page in a third incog­nito win­dow.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>MI­CROSOFT EDGE</p>
    <p>Press the Con­trol-Shift-N keys si­mul­ta­ne­ously when us­ing Mi­crosoft Edge to open the browser in its pri­vate, or InPri­vate, mode.</p>
    <p>The browser will au­to­mat­i­cally delete your brows­ing his­tory, cook­ies, cached images and files, pass­words, aut­ofill form data, site per­mis­sions and hosted app data when you exit the browser. It still al­lows you to save your favourite sites and down­loaded files.</p>
    <p>If your de­fault search en­gine is Bing, search­ing in the ad­dress bar will be done via InPri­vate search.</p>
    <p>If you’re con­cerned about chil­dren brows­ing on shared com­put­ers, you can opt for “strict” track­ing to block a ma­jor­ity of au­to­matic track­ers.</p>
    <p>At the top right cor­ner in Edge, click on the three-dots icon. Then go to Set­tings, click on Pri­vacy, Search and Ser­vices, and opt for ba­sic, bal­anced or strict pri­vacy set­tings.</p>
    <p>3 FIRE­FOX</p>
    <p>On Mozilla Fire­fox, you can start a pri­vate brows­ing ses­sion by si­mul­ta­ne­ously press­ing the Con­trol-Shift-P keys on Win­dows PCs or the Com­mand-Shift-P keys on Mac com­put­ers.</p>
    <p>Fire­fox uses a list of known track­ers pro­vided by Dis­con­nect (dis­con­nect.me), a pri­vacy-fo­cused web­site, and blocks these track­ers and scripts by de­fault. These in­clude so­cial me­dia track­ers, cross-site track­ing cook­ies, fin­ger­print­ers and crypto min­ers. Such track­ers can be hid­den in ads, videos and other on-page con­tent.</p>
    <p>Note that block­ing these can cause some web­sites to stop work­ing. Down­load con­tent only from sites you trust. Fire­fox uses open-source code which is reg­u­larly au­dited and up­dated. If you want a pri­vacy-fo­cused ver­sion of Fire­fox for mo­bile de­vices, try Fire­fox Focus.</p>
    <p>4 SA­FARI</p>
    <p>Ap­ple’s Sa­fari was the first to of­fer pri­vate brows­ing.</p>
    <p>The phrase was in­tro­duced in 2005 to de­scribe Sa­fari 2.0 fea­tures that lim­ited what the browser would save.</p>
    <p>Press the Com­mand-Shift-N keys si­mul­ta­ne­ously to open a Pri­vate Win­dow in Sa­fari.</p>
    <p>The browser tags each Pri­vate Win­dow by dark­en­ing the ad­dress bar. Like Fire­fox, Sa­fari uses pri­vacy tech­nolo­gies from other play­ers, whether you’re brows­ing in stan­dard or pri­vate mode.</p>
    <p>Its In­tel­li­gent Track­ing Protection also blocks all third-party cook­ies, ads and in­tru­sive ser­vices that may be used to track you as you browse on your Mac or iPhone.</p>
    <p>STAY SE­CURE</p>
    <p>Brows­ing in incog­nito or pri­vate modes is an easy way to bump up cy­ber se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>While the only fool­proof way to go en­tirely incog­nito is to use a vir­tual pri­vate net­work (VPN) ser­vice, good VPN ser­vices come with monthly subscripti­on fees.</p>
    <p>Un­less you’re work­ing in a highly sen­si­tive sec­tor or or­gan­i­sa­tion, you don’t re­quire such en­hanced se­cu­rity. If you are, your or­gan­i­sa­tion would al­ready have VPN ser­vices and se­cu­rity poli­cies and pro­to­cols in place that you should use and strictly fol­low.</p>
