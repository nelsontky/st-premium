    <p>LON­DON • The Fifa Club World Cup, orig­i­nally planned for De­cem­ber, will now be held from Feb 1 to 11 in Doha, Qatar, or­gan­is­ers said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The tour­na­ment brings to­gether the six con­ti­nen­tal cham­pi­ons and the hosts, with Cham­pi­ons League win­ners Bay­ern Mu­nich the first to qual­ify.</p>
    <p>Last sea­son’s tour­na­ment saw Liver­pool beat Brazil­ian club Fla­mengo in the fi­nal.</p>
    <p>World gov­ern­ing body Fifa did not state if sup­port­ers would be able to at­tend any of the games, not­ing only that “in line with Fifa’s in­ter­na­tional match pro­to­col, Fifa and the host coun­try will pro­vide the re­quired safe­guards for the health and safety of all in­volved”.</p>
    <p>A new ex­panded 24-team Club World Cup was due to be held in June to July next year in China but with Euro 2020 and the Copa Amer­ica be­ing held next year be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic, the tour­na­ment is set to be resched­uled.</p>
    <p>Fifa also opted against mov­ing two post­poned age-group Women’s World Cups to next year, in­stead al­low­ing the planned hosts to hold those tour­na­ments in 2022. Costa Rica and In­dia will or­gan­ise the Un­der-20 and Un­der-17 events re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, the Asian Cham­pi­ons League (East), sus­pended be­cause of the pan­demic since early March, re­sumed yes­ter­day after an eight-month de­lay.</p>
    <p>First-half goals by Peng Xinli and Yu Han­chao se­cured Shang­hai</p>
    <p>Shen­hua a 2-1 win over Perth Glory in their Group F tie.</p>
    <p>Fif­teen teams will race through 33 matches in a lit­tle over two weeks to com­plete the group stage, with eight teams then play­ing the knock­out phase to de­cide who reach the Dec 19 fi­nal.</p>
    <p>Play­ers and of­fi­cials, who have all been cleared of Covid-19 pre­and post-de­par­ture, will have to un­dergo poly­merase chain re­ac­tion tests every three to six days and games will be played be­hind closed doors in the Doha bio-se­cure bub­ble.</p>
    <p>All those in­volved are lim­ited only to the ho­tel, sta­dium and train­ing sites, and Qatari of­fi­cials are con­fi­dent that re­fine­ments made to health pro­to­cols will pre­vent any in­fec­tions from again in­flu­enc­ing the out­come of the com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>The Asian Cham­pi­ons League (West), com­pleted last month, was hit by a raft of cases, in­clud­ing within Saudi ti­tle-hold­ers Al Hi­lal, who were un­able to fin­ish their fixtures due to a lack of play­ers.</p>
    <p>Dr Ab­dul Wa­hab Al Musleh, the ad­viser to the Qatari Min­is­ter of Public Health, said the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties had learnt from the ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>“This time we are do­ing the test­ing more of­ten,” he told Reuters. “And there are sev­eral other public mea­sures that we have un­der­taken.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, we limit their in­ter­ac­tions with oth­ers, in­clud­ing their own team in the ho­tel, so we en­cour­age strongly all their tech­ni­cal meet­ings are hap­pen­ing on­line or out­doors.”</p>
