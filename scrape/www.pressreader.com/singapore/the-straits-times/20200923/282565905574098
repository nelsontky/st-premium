    <p>Fans of Star Wars ac­tor Ewan McGre­gor will know the Scots­man is a mo­tor­cy­cle nut, bik­ing from Lon­don to New York in 2004 and from the north­ern tip of Scot­land to Cape Town in South Africa in 2007.</p>
    <p>Both epic jour­neys were taken with his best friend, Bri­tish tele­vi­sion pre­sen­ter and ac­tor Charley Boor­man, and their ad­ven­tures were doc­u­mented in two tele­vi­sion series – Long Way Round and Long Way Down – re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>The two then drifted apart be­cause McGre­gor, who played ObiWan Kenobi in the Star Wars pre­quels (1999 to 2005), lives in the United States and Boor­man in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>But they re­con­nected in 2016, when Boor­man was in­volved in a near-fa­tal mo­tor­cy­cle ac­ci­dent in Por­tu­gal.</p>
    <p>And that is how the duo came to ride to­gether again for a third do­cuseries, Long Way Up, now stream­ing on Ap­ple TV+. It shows them travers­ing 13 coun­tries in South and Cen­tral Amer­ica – an am­bi­tious trip span­ning 20,000km in 100 days.</p>
    <p>But things are a bit dif­fer­ent for the friends this time round, they tell The Straits Times in a re­cent in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>For one thing, they rode elec­tric mo­tor­bikes, which meant ex­tra log­i­cal chal­lenges for the crew, who needed to en­sure there was a charg­ing sta­tion ev­ery 160km or so.</p>
    <p>And while they still love the open road, they ad­mit they are older and wiser and ride a bit more cau­tiously now.</p>
    <p>Chat­ting by video call – McGre­gor from his home in Los An­ge­les and Boor­man from Lon­don – they dis­cuss their ad­ven­ture through</p>
    <p>Ar­gentina, Chile, Bo­livia, Peru, Ecuador, Colom­bia and Mex­ico.</p>
    <p>Boor­man, 54, says: “It has been 13 years since the last one, but the spe­cial re­la­tion­ship be­tween Ewan and I has never gone away. We just ended up liv­ing on dif­fer­ent sides of the At­lantic and life and work sort of got in the way, so we just kept miss­ing each other.”</p>
    <p>His ac­ci­dent “fo­cused us back to­gether again”, he adds. They re­con­nected in Bri­tain and picked up right where they left off.</p>
    <p>They started talk­ing about mo­tor­bikes again, as they al­ways do.</p>
    <p>“Then we started think­ing about do­ing this trip and one of our pro­duc­ers, Russ Malkin, floated the idea of elec­tric mo­tor­bikes, be­cause elec­tric ve­hi­cles seem to be com­ing to the fore­front now and no one had done (such a trip).”</p>
    <p>McGre­gor, 49, agrees that noth­ing has changed in terms of his and Boor­man’s friend­ship.</p>
    <p>“We’re the same op­ti­mistic and pretty bloody-minded peo­ple who just like to go out there and do it. And we’re lucky to have a great team with our pro­duc­ers and our bril­liant cam­era­man, who comes with us.</p>
    <p>“So we don’t have to worry about pro­duc­ing tele­vi­sion and can just en­joy the ex­pe­ri­ence. That’s what I al­ways be­lieved made Long Way Round and Long Way Down the TV shows they were,” says the ac­tor, who ap­peared in the mu­si­cal films Moulin Rouge! (2001) and Beauty And The Beast (2017).</p>
    <p>But he ac­knowl­edges that Boor­man’s ac­ci­dent was al­ways in the back of their minds – espe­cially “when we were on dif­fi­cult roads in Bo­livia”.</p>
    <p>“The stakes were higher, in terms of fall­ing off or some­thing, than they had been be­fore.”</p>
    <p>The jour­ney could not be as spon­ta­neous as their pre­vi­ous ones as well be­cause of recharge the bikes.</p>
    <p>“The elec­tric na­ture of the trip dic­tated that it was slightly dif­fer­ent – we had to be some­where where there was elec­tric­ity at night to charge the bikes.</p>
    <p>“So we found our­selves less in the mid­dle of nowhere, which I loved about our first two trips – that we could go, ‘Let’s stop here’, and put our tents up.”</p>
    <p>Still, that “didn’t al­ter our mind­set at all” when it came to the ad­ven­ture it­self, says McGre­gor. “We just did it.</p>
    <p>“And we had an amaz­ing ex­pe­ri­ence in all the coun­tries we went through. We met peo­ple who were kind and gen­er­ous all the way along.” the need</p>
