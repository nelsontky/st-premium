    <p>Job de­scrip­tions like “head dis­tiller” or “head brewer” are now a vi­able job prospect, with more Sin­ga­porean-run brew­eries and dis­til­leries com­ing of age and a stream of en­thu­si­as­tic new­com­ers join­ing the fold.</p>
    <p>Growth has been promis­ing over the last four years, with lo­cally brewed beers and spir­its be­ing stocked along­side in­ter­na­tional brands on su­per­mar­ket shelves and bar backs.</p>
    <p>Craft beer brew­ery Brew­lan­der is lead­ing the way for the small but spir­ited craft beer brew­ing com­mu­nity here, which now has more than 30 play­ers.</p>
    <p>It used to “gypsy brew” by get­ting an ex­ter­nal fa­cil­ity in Cam­bo­dia to brew its beers when it launched in March 2017.</p>
    <p>But four years on, founder John Wei, 37, is now en route to open­ing a full-fledged dis­tillery in Tuas by the end of the year, where he will fi­nally be able to call his beers “made in Sin­ga­pore”.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Brass Lion Dis­tillery in Pasir Pan­jang now pumps out about 1,000 bot­tles of gin ev­ery week, up from 200 when it opened in Oc­to­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>Not only are its gins stocked in world-renowned, Sin­ga­pore­based bars like Man­hat­tan, Jig­ger & Pony and At­las, it is now primed for in­ter­na­tional ex­pan­sion as part of es­tab­lished spir­its dis­trib­u­tor Proof & Com­pany’s port­fo­lio.</p>
    <p>The new­est kid on the block, Sin­ga­pore Dis­tillery, was launched in June by a team led by 26-year-old head dis­tiller Ash­win Sekaran.</p>
    <p>The five-month-old en­tity al­ready has a suite of six gins to its name, in­clud­ing a clas­sic Lon­don Dry called Singa Gin, and more unique vari­ants like Co­conut Pan­dan gin and Stolen Roses gin.</p>
    <p>While the scene has grown by leaps and bounds in a short time, with a hand­ful of new play­ers join­ing the brew­ing and dis­till­ing com­mu­nity ev­ery year, Brass Lion Dis­tillery founder Jamie Koh, 35, feels that “there’s still a lot to be done”.</p>
    <p>She notes that there are only four dis­til­leries cur­rently – Brass Lion Dis­tillery, Sin­ga­pore Dis­tillery, Com­pendium and Tan­glin.</p>
    <p>And she says that rules and reg­u­la­tions have not quite caught up with the pace at which dis­til­leries and brew­eries now need to op­er­ate.</p>
    <p>Some of the hur­dles she had to over­come in­cluded get­ting dis­till­ing per­mits and im­port­ing new make spirit, the base used to make gin.</p>
    <p>When her dis­tillery started to make Sin­ga­pore’s first sin­gle malt whisky in Novem­ber last year, it had not been done here be­fore, so there were many reg­u­la­tory is­sues to sort out, she re­calls.</p>
    <p>“Ed­u­ca­tion and reg­u­la­tions haven’t quite caught up and we are still work­ing through these is­sues with the au­thor­i­ties on a daily ba­sis. Once that hap­pens, it’ll be a lot eas­ier for peo­ple to come in to the scene,” she says.</p>
    <p>But she also cau­tions against over­sat­u­ra­tion, which has hap­pened in Bri­tain, where there are an es­ti­mated 160 dis­til­leries. The pan­demic has dec­i­mated many of the small play­ers.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing a scene is good, but if there are too many play­ers, not ev­ery­one will be able to sur­vive be­cause Sin­ga­pore is a small mar­ket, and glob­ally, it is a com­pet­i­tive mar­ket as well.”</p>
    <p>“Open­ing a dis­tillery is a costly busi­ness and a huge en­deav­our... One re­ally needs to have the pas­sion and de­ter­mi­na­tion to see it through.”</p>
