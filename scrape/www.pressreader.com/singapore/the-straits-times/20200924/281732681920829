    <p>MEA­SURES HAVE BEEN EF­FEC­TIVE</p>
    <p>It is also an in­di­ca­tion that our safe dis­tanc­ing and safe man­age­ment mea­sures, cou­pled with the use of face masks and height­ened vig­i­lance on ev­ery­one’s part, are pow­er­ful and ef­fec­tive weapons in our fight against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>HEALTH MIN­IS­TER GAN KIM YONG, on the neg­a­tive test re­sults of the re­cent voluntary test­ing ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>All driv­ers, stall­hold­ers and food de­liv­ery per­son­nel who have par­tic­i­pated in voluntary test­ing ex­er­cises have tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19 so far, said Health Min­is­ter Gan</p>
    <p>Kim Yong yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>They in­clude the more than 10,000 taxi and pri­vate-hire car driv­ers, as well as the more than 750 stall­hold­ers and food de­liv­ery per­son­nel, who were tested ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>The Government will next con­sider ex­pand­ing the voluntary test­ing scheme to other groups, in­clud­ing univer­sity stu­dents in hos­tels, added Mr Gan dur­ing a vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Voluntary test­ing op­er­a­tions for taxi and pri­vate-hire car driv­ers took place from Sept 8 to Sept 22.</p>
    <p>Stall­hold­ers and food de­liv­ery per­son­nel were also tested in Marine Pa­rade over the week­end as part of a pi­lot for stall­hold­ers in the con­stituency, as well as for se­lected groups of food de­liv­ery per­son­nel.</p>
    <p>The test­ing was done at tem­po­rary swab sites in the com­mu­nity, such as at taxi de­pots, as well as the Health Pro­mo­tion Board’s re­gional screen­ing cen­tres.</p>
    <p>“Next, we will be con­sid­er­ing ex­tend­ing the test­ing to other hawker cen­tres, mar­kets, cof­fee shops, as well as other groups, such as univer­sity stu­dents in hos­tels,” said Mr Gan.</p>
    <p>De­tails on the roll-out of Covid-19 test­ing for stall­hold­ers and food de­liv­ery per­son­nel will be made known when ready, said the Health Min­istry (MOH) in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the press con­fer­ence, Mr Gan thanked those who stepped for­ward for the voluntary tests, and said the neg­a­tive test re­sults so far are a good sign, as they in­di­cate low preva­lence in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>He added: “It is also an in­di­ca­tion that our safe dis­tanc­ing and safe man­age­ment mea­sures, cou­pled with the use of face masks and height­ened vig­i­lance on ev­ery­one’s part, are pow­er­ful and ef­fec­tive weapons in our fight against Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said in a Face­book post last night that he was glad that the more than 10,000 taxi and pri­vate-hire car driv­ers who stepped for­ward for test­ing had been given a clean bill of health.</p>
    <p>“Let’s con­tinue to take pre­cau­tions, prac­tise safe man­age­ment mea­sures and keep pub­lic trans­port safe,” he said in the post.</p>
    <p>The voluntary tests were part of a larger ini­tia­tive that the MOH an­nounced on Aug 29, which in­volves of­fer­ing one-time poly­merase chain re­ac­tion tests to com­mu­nity groups that have fre­quent in­ter­ac­tions with the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>They in­clude taxi and pri­vate­hire car driv­ers, food de­liv­ery per­son­nel and key ven­dors ser­vic­ing for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan noted that the over­all Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in Sin­ga­pore is stable, but he urged Sin­ga­pore­ans not to let their guard down.</p>
    <p>“Each pre­cau­tion we take, how­ever small it may seem, is the key to keep­ing our fam­i­lies, our friends and fel­low Sin­ga­pore­ans safe.”</p>
