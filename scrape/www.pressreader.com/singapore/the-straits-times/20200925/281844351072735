    <p>Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son is al­ready un­der siege, ac­cused of bungling his gov­ern­ment’s han­dling of the Covid-19 pan­demic, as well as the coun­try’s de­par­ture from the Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>But it is likely to get even more un­com­fort­able for him.</p>
    <p>For Labour, Bri­tain’s largest op­po­si­tion party, is now de­ter­mined to present it­self as a vi­able gov­ern­ment al­ter­na­tive.</p>
    <p>And Mr Keir Starmer, t he party’s new leader, has emerged from its an­nual con­fer­ence which con­cluded this week very much as a prime min­is­ter-in-wait­ing.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre-left Labour party was last in power a decade ago and looks likely to be kept out of power for the first half of this decade as well.</p>
    <p>Lan­guish­ing for many years in op­po­si­tion is cer­tainly painful, but not that un­usual in Bri­tish pol­i­tics; Labour was kept out of power for a to­tal of 18 years dur­ing the 1980s and 1990s.</p>
    <p>What is extraordin­ary, how­ever, about today’s Labour op­po­si­tion is that it has lost elections at a time when Mr John­son’s rul­ing Con­ser­va­tives were hope­lessly split and their gov­ern­ments fre­quently paral­ysed over the ques­tion of Bri­tain’s de­par­ture from the EU, a mat­ter which has dom­i­nated Bri­tish pol­i­tics for years and has yet to be re­solved.</p>
    <p>An op­po­si­tion party that can­not win against a gov­ern­ment which seemed so rud­der­less clearly had a prob­lem.</p>
    <p>And to make mat­ters worse,</p>
    <p>Labour shed even more of the work­ing-class vote, its his­toric core con­stituency, with ev­ery gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>At the polls last De­cem­ber, some of its pre­vi­ously safest con­stituen­cies, in­clud­ing the one held by Mr Tony Blair, Labour’s long­est-serv­ing prime min­is­ter, fell to the Con­ser­va­tives, a hu­mil­i­a­tion without prece­dent.</p>
    <p>The main rea­son for this sorry out­come was the fact that Labour was led by Mr Jeremy Cor­byn, a far-left politi­cian who en­joyed strong sup­port among party ac­tivists in Lon­don, but had zero ap­peal out­side the ma­jor cities, and ap­peared ut­terly im­plau­si­ble as a po­ten­tial prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the rul­ing Con­ser­va­tives had no real op­po­si­tion; their gov­ern­ment made one mis­take af­ter an­other, but their share of the popular vote in­creased with ev­ery elec­tion; last De­cem­ber, the Con­ser­va­tives scored their best elec­toral re­sult in al­most half a cen­tury.</p>
    <p>Labour elected Mr Starmer in April in the hope of pulling the party back from the wilder­ness.</p>
    <p>The 58-old lawyer who headed the Crown Pros­e­cu­tion Ser­vice, the agency re­spon­si­ble for launch­ing all crim­i­nal pros­e­cu­tions, de­scribes him­self as a mod­er­ate left-winger, much more in tune with most of the elec­torate.</p>
    <p>Mr Starmer has also made a mark in Par­lia­ment, where he fre­quently does better than the Prime Min­is­ter; un­like Mr John­son who is fa­mously un­in­ter­ested in de­tail, the op­po­si­tion leader boasts a foren­sic at­ten­tion to the minute as­pects of pol­icy.</p>
    <p>And, as his con­duct at Labour’s an­nual party con­fer­ence held this week indi­cates, Mr Starmer is also good at com­mu­ni­cat­ing his mes­sage.</p>
    <p>Due to the health re­stric­tions, the con­fer­ence was held vir­tu­ally, over In­ter­net plat­forms.</p>
    <p>But Mr Starmer re­sisted the temp­ta­tion of copy­ing the vir­tual an­nual con­ven­tion re­cently mounted by the Democrats in the United States, who are Labour’s ide­o­log­i­cal soul­mates.</p>
    <p>While the Democrats’ event was a slick mix of en­ter­tain­ment and pol­i­tics, Labour’s con­fer­ence was shorn of any me­dia-friendly gim­micks.</p>
    <p>Mr Starmer’s speech was de­liv­ered with him stand­ing against a plain back­ground of a red brick wall, a re­minder of some of the grim hous­ing es­tates in which many of the party’s vot­ers live.</p>
    <p>And there was no taped ap­plause of the kind the Democrats re­sorted to in the US.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s op­po­si­tion leader also said Labour had to be “bru­tally honest” that it had only it­self to blame for be­ing de­feated in four gen­eral elections in a row.</p>
    <p>“When you lose an elec­tion in a democ­racy, you de­serve to,” he told the party.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, he sig­nalled an end to end­less dis­cus­sions about Europe, by ad­mit­ting that Labour could not re­verse the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment’s de­ci­sion to leave the EU.</p>
    <p>“Let me be ab­so­lutely clear,” he said, “the de­bate be­tween leave and re­main is over”. In­stead, he ar­gued, Bri­tain’s op­po­si­tion should con­cen­trate on get­ting the best pos­si­ble trade deal with Europe.</p>
    <p>With the next gen­eral elec­tion not due be­fore 2024, all that Mr Starmer can do is to pre­pare his party for the long haul.</p>
    <p>Still, Labour’s re­launch ef­forts are be­ing watched with in­ter­est by fel­low So­cial­ist par­ties in Europe, most of which are also strug­gling with the task of re­gain­ing power.</p>
    <p>And, for the first time in a decade, Bri­tain now has an op­po­si­tion leader who not only as­pires to be a prime min­is­ter but also looks per­fectly cred­i­ble in that po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s op­po­si­tion leader also said Labour had to be “bru­tally honest” that it had only it­self to blame for be­ing de­feated in four gen­eral elections in a row. “When you lose an elec­tion in a democ­racy, you de­serve to,” he told the party.</p>
