    <p>ROME • For­mer French Open cham­pion Gar­bine Mugu­ruza is not afraid of play­ing as many “tough” matches as pos­si­ble, af­ter beat­ing Amer­i­can teenage sen­sa­tion Coco Gauff to ad­vance to the</p>
    <p>Ital­ian Open last 16 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Spa­niard, 26, out­lasted her 16-year-old op­po­nent 7-6 (7-3), 3-6, 6-3 af­ter sur­viv­ing a scare in the sec­ond set.</p>
    <p>“It was a tough match, I’m look­ing for­ward for tough matches,” said Mugu­ruza, the 2016 Roland Gar­ros cham­pion and two-time Ma­jor win­ner. “I am just think­ing to leave from Rome hope­fully with the tro­phy or play­ing as many matches as pos­si­ble, US Open was short (af­ter ex­it­ing in the sec­ond round). Just be­ing here (in Rome) and en­joy­ing as much as I can.”</p>
    <p>She added of Gauff: “I think she’s here, doesn’t mat­ter how old she is. For me I’m not think­ing about that, I think she’s a great com­peti­tor.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter claim­ing the open­ing set, Mugu­ruza could do lit­tle to stop Gauff from tak­ing the sec­ond set.</p>
    <p>But the teenager had three suc­ces­sive dou­ble faults in the third, which changed the course of the match. In to­tal, Gauff had 15 dou­ble faults com­pared to Mugu­ruza’s nine.</p>
    <p>The ninth seed moved to the last 16 in Rome for the fourth time af­ter the 2hr 27min clash and will face ei­ther Irina-Camelia Begu or sev­enth seed Jo­hanna Konta in the third round.</p>
    <p>In the men’s draw, Rafael Nadal, in his first match i n over six months, swept aside fel­low Spa­niard Pablo Car­reno Busta on Wed­nes­day to reach the third round. The nine-time Rome win­ner came through 6-1, 6-1 against 18th-ranked Car­reno Busta, a re­cent semi-fi­nal­ist at the US Open.</p>
    <p>“It was a per­fect start for me. It was solid, good shots on the fore­hand and back­hand. I didn’t ex­pect to play that well,” Nadal said.</p>
    <p>“Maybe Pablo was a lit­tle bit</p>
    <p>CLAY TIME</p>
    <p>I am just think­ing to leave from Rome hope­fully with the tro­phy or play­ing as many matches as pos­si­ble, US Open was short (af­ter ex­it­ing in the ’’ sec­ond round).</p>
    <p>GAR­BINE MUGU­RUZA, on spend­ing more time on court at the Ital­ian Open.</p>
    <p>tired from a great tour­na­ment in New York, but think­ing about my­self, I played a very solid match and very se­ri­ous and do­ing a lot of things very well. So very happy.”</p>
    <p>The world No. 2 has not played since win­ning in Aca­pulco at the end of Fe­bru­ary, opt­ing to skip the US hard-court swing be­cause of coron­avirus con­cerns.</p>
    <p>Nadal, a 12-time French Open win­ner, is the sec­ond seed be­hind world No. 1 No­vak Djokovic in the tune-up for the fi­nal Grand Slam of the sea­son at Roland Gar­ros on Sept 27.</p>
