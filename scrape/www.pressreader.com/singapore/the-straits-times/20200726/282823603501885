    <p>One hun­dred hours. That’s all it took for global coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions to rise by a mil­lion in the five days lead­ing up to last Satur­day a week ago.</p>
    <p>Just four days later, on Wed­nes­day, to­tal case num­bers hit 15 mil­lion af­ter surg­ing by another mil­lion as a pan­demic that has crip­pled the global econ­omy and put mil­lions of peo­ple out of work spread at an un­prece­dented rate. And by yes­ter­day evening, the tally was just shy of 16 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>And there is no sign of it slow­ing. With mul­ti­ple coun­tries record­ing record rates of in­fec­tion in the past two weeks, the grim sta­tis­tics dis­prove pol­i­cy­mak­ers’ hopes that strict lock­downs would rein in the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>The re­ported num­bers may only be the tip of the ice­berg. “The ac­tual num­ber of in­fec­tions re­mains un­cer­tain but likely un­der­es­ti­mated. Sim­i­larly, the pre­cise fig­ure of fa­tal­i­ties di­rectly or in­di­rectly at­trib­ut­able to Covid-19 re­mains un­cer­tain,” Pro­fes­sor Leo Yee Sin, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases (NCID), tells The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>But­tress­ing this point, Prof Leo cites a re­port in the Journal of the Amer­i­can Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion this month that put es­ti­mated deaths world­wide at close to 20 per cent higher dur­ing the pe­riod be­tween March and April, about two-thirds of which were at­trib­ut­able to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The prom­ise of a mir­a­cle vac­cine af­ter the virus first emerged in Wuhan, China, has been tem­pered by the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO), which is un­der fire for its ini­tial re­sponse to the out­break. The WHO says a per­fect vac­cine that will be avail­able to ev­ery­one im­me­di­ately re­mains out of sight for now, even as phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal gi­ants around the world race to come up with a cure that would po­ten­tially be worth bil­lions of dol­lars.</p>
    <p>The WHO’s per­ceived mis­steps prompted the United States to with­draw fund­ing for the global body af­ter Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump ac­cused it of kow­tow­ing to the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment. The ac­tion by a coun­try that has tra­di­tion­ally been the big­gest con­trib­u­tor of funds to the WHO has jeop­ar­dised co­or­di­nated global ef­forts to tackle a dis­ease that has killed over 643,000 peo­ple in seven months.</p>
    <p>POL­ICY MIS­STEPS</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Trump’s anger may be gauged from the fact that the US has emerged as the worst-af­fected coun­try in the health cri­sis, with over 4.2 mil­lion cases and over 148,000 deaths as of 5pm yes­ter­day. But Mr Trump’s own han­dling of the sit­u­a­tion has also drawn crit­i­cism, with the Amer­i­can bil­lion­aire – who faces an elec­tion in Novem­ber – con­sis­tently down­play­ing the threat posed by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump had long dis­par­aged the use of face masks to pre­vent con­ta­gion and even went against</p>
    <p>378,285 42,645 11.27 4,248,492 148,492 3.49 375,961 17,843 4.74 341,304 8,914 2.61 15,716,043</p>
    <p>the ad­vice of his ad­min­is­tra­tion’s own health ex­perts to claim that the virus does not pose a grave risk to life. He has also al­leged that calls to l ock down the US and take stricter mea­sures to avert more deaths are a con­spir­acy to sab­o­tage his re-elec­tion ef­fort.</p>
    <p>He is not the only politi­cian who has done so, how­ever. Brazil’s Pres­i­dent Jair Bol­sonaro, a self-con­fessed Trump fan, has also dis­par­aged health ex­perts’ warn­ings of the need for tough mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Mr Bol­sonaro’s strat­egy has re­sulted in Brazil be­com­ing the sec­ond worst-af­fected coun­try in the world, with over 2.3 mil­lion in­fec­tions and 85,385 deaths as of yes­ter­day evening. Although he, too, has been in­fected by the coro­n­avirus, he has scoffed at the dan­ger.</p>
    <p>The Brazil­ian Pres­i­dent’s con­cerns about the eco­nomic fall­out of lock­downs are shared by In­dian Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi. De­spite one of the strictest lock­downs in the world, In­dia has not man­aged to avert a health catas­tro­phe.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has seen over 1.3 mil­lion in­fec­tions since Covid-19 reached its shores. The In­dian gov­ern­ment has nev­er­the­less touted its rel­a­tively low death rate in com­par­i­son to West­ern coun­tries, with just 31,425 fa­tal­i­ties, to jus­tify a re­open­ing of the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>But ex­perts have stated that the low mor­tal­ity rate in In­dia may not be at­trib­ut­able to gov­ern­ment ef­forts. They said the coun­try’s young pop­u­la­tion, and the low in­ci­dence of life­style dis­eases such as obe­sity and di­a­betes, were the main fac­tors</p>
    <p>297,914 45,677 15.33 2,348,200 85,385 3.63 637,618</p>
    <p>that led to fewer deaths from a virus that has been found to pose a greater threat to the old and in­firm.</p>
    <p>Con­cerns have also been raised about Covid-19 re­port­ing in In­dia, a coun­try with a health­care in­fra­struc­ture that is ill-equipped to tend to a bil­lion-plus pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>WHO spokesman Tarik Jasare­vic tells The Sun­day Times: “If gov­ern­ments do not clearly com­mu­ni­cate with their cit­i­zens and roll out a com­pre­hen­sive strat­egy fo­cused on sup­press­ing trans­mis­sion and sav­ing lives, if pop­u­la­tions do not fol­low the ba­sic pub­lic health prin­ci­ples of phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing, hand­wash­ing, wear­ing masks, cough­ing eti­quette and stay­ing at home when sick; if the ba­sics aren’t fol­lowed, there is only one way this pan­demic is go­ing to go, it’s go­ing to get worse and worse and worse.”</p>
    <p>SPI­RALLING DEATH TOLL</p>
    <p>Global coro­n­avirus data clearly il­lus­trates the suc­cess of some coun­tries in bat­tling the deadly virus in com­par­i­son to oth­ers that have seen ris­ing num­bers of in­fec­tions and soar­ing death tolls.</p>
    <p>In the ini­tial weeks af­ter the pan­demic came to the world’s at­ten­tion, the mor­tal­ity rate from the dis­ease – the per­cent­age of peo­ple who would die out of the to­tal num­ber of in­fected – was pegged at 2 per cent. Sub­se­quently, the WHO pro­vided its own es­ti­mate of a 3.4 per cent mor­tal­ity rate.</p>
    <p>How­ever, given that the world has wit­nessed 15.9 mil­lion cases and over 643,000 deaths, the real mor­tal­ity rate world­wide is over 4</p>
    <p>319,501 28,432 8.89 421,996 6,343 1.50 July 24: 289,028</p>
    <p>per cent. The di­ver­gence is at­trib­ut­able to the higher mor­tal­ity in some coun­tries in com­par­i­son to oth­ers.</p>
    <p>The WHO has said of the mor­tal­ity rate: “It is a ‘snap­shot’ of the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion. This ra­tio can vary con­sid­er­ably dur­ing an out­break. Such num­bers are al­ways evolv­ing, and we will not have a clear CFR (case fa­tal­ity ra­tio) un­til the out­break is over.”</p>
    <p>Adding to the con­cerns about the ram­pant spread of the virus, in­creased test­ing for Covid-19 across the world has also re­sulted in more pos­i­tive cases be­ing de­tected. The WHO tells The Sun­day Times that while test pos­i­tiv­ity rates can be an in­di­ca­tor for the in­ten­sity of dis­ease trans­mis­sion, they must be con­sid­ered along­side other cri­te­ria such as health sys­tem ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>GLIM­MER OF HOPE 1,339,176 31,425 2.34</p>
    <p>De­spite the ver­i­ta­ble moun­tain of bad news, there re­mains hope in the midst of the global cri­sis. One ray of hope is re­search find­ings that show the num­ber of Covid-19 pa­tients who have died in hos­pi­tal has fallen by 60 per cent since the start of March to 42 per cent at end-May. This rate was ap­pli­ca­ble across Asia, Europe and North Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>NCID’s Prof Leo says the in­ten­sive care unit is the last of the chain of care ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“To re­duce mor­tal­ity, we need to look at the en­tire chain of care de­liv­ery with em­pha­sis on early care,” she says, high­light­ing ef­forts for early in­ter­ven­tion and in­creased test­ing.</p>
    <p>In that re­gard, the ex­pe­ri­ence of</p>
    <p>49,888 27</p>
    <p>0.05 806,720 13,192 1.63 Covid-19</p>
    <p>773,118 665,998</p>
    <p>645,666</p>
    <p>462,676 389,546 364,826 298,082 249,242 193,846 172,422 116,596 114,330 105,884 93,112 92,288 90,640 73,954 42,848 40,676 31,518</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is play­ing a valu­able role in na­tions’ un­der­stand­ing of the coro­n­avirus and how to com­bat it. The coun­try has had 49,888 in­fec­tions so far, with the death toll at 27. The gov­ern­ment’s ag­gres­sive strat­egy of de­tect­ing in­fec­tions early, iso­lat­ing in­fected res­i­dents and con­tact trac­ing has en­abled the coun­try to see a mor­tal­ity rate much be­low the global av­er­age.</p>
    <p>Strict poli­cies gov­ern­ing the wear­ing of face masks and so­cial dis­tanc­ing have also re­sulted in a sig­nif­i­cant de­cline in the num­ber of in­fec­tions in Sin­ga­pore, though the virus has proved re­silient and cases con­tinue to emerge.</p>
    <p>Prof Leo cites lo­cal re­search sup­port­ing the ev­i­dence-based man­age­ment of Covid-19 in Sin­ga­pore and notes that it is among the few coun­tries in the world to part­ner the United States’ Na­tional In­sti­tutes of Health in adap­tive Covid-19 treat­ment trial stud­ies us­ing remde­sivir, an im­mune-mod­u­la­tor.</p>
    <p>Mr Jasare­vic of the WHO points out that there will be no short­cuts out of this pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We all hope there will be an ef­fec­tive vac­cine, but we need to fo­cus on us­ing the tools we have now to sup­press trans­mis­sion and save lives,” he says.</p>
    <p>“We need to reach a sus­tain­able sit­u­a­tion where we have ad­e­quate con­trol of this virus with­out shut­ting down our lives en­tirely or lurch­ing from lock­down to lock­down, which has a hugely detri­men­tal im­pact on so­ci­ety and econ­omy.”</p>
