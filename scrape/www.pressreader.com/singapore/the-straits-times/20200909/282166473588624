    <p>Grab is in ad­vanced talks with Pru­den­tial, AIA Group and oth­ers as it seeks US$300 mil­lion to US$500 mil­lion (S$411 mil­lion to S$685 mil­lion) in in­vest­ment for its fi­nan­cial ser­vice unit, peo­ple with di­rect knowl­edge of the mat­ter told Reuters.</p>
    <p>South-east Asia’s Grab, which evolved from ride­hail­ing app oper­a­tor to one-stop shop for ser­vices as var­ied as food de­liv­ery and in­sur­ance, aims to reach agree­ments as early as next month, the peo­ple said.</p>
    <p>In­sur­ers are likely to pro­vide half of the tar­get spread over a few fundrais­ing rounds, said one of the peo­ple, who de­clined to be iden­ti­fied as prospec­tive in­vestors have not been made pub­lic. Pru­den­tial and AIA are named here for the first time.</p>
    <p>They said Grab Fi­nan­cial Group’s pre-money val­u­a­tion – the value of an un­listed start-up be­fore its next fund­ing round – has been es­ti­mated at about US$2 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Grab, Pru­den­tial and AIA de­clined to com­ment. The fundrais­ing, com­ing as the Covid-19 pan­demic dec­i­mates the global econ­omy, un­der­scores the po­ten­tial for tech­nol­ogy-led fi­nan­cial ser­vices as the bulk of re­tail transactio­ns goes dig­i­tal.</p>
    <p>It also in­di­cates the pan­demic’s lim­ited im­pact on fundrais­ing ef­forts for South-east Asia’s most valu­able start-up – worth US$14 bil­lion, sources have said – even though its busi­ness in eight coun­tries has suf­fered from coro­n­avirus con­trol mea­sures.</p>
    <p>At Grab and In­done­sian ri­val Go­jek, lock­downs have sav­aged the trans­port busi­ness but have sparked a boom in food de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>Back­ing from Pru­den­tial and AIA would add heft to Grab’s fi­nan­cial ser­vice am­bi­tions, which go be­yond ex­pand­ing its in­sur­ance and lend­ing busi­nesses and into the realm of wealth man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>“Fi­nal­is­ing new fund­ing dur­ing th­ese times could also help Grab in its sales pitch for the Sin­ga­pore bank­ing li­cence,” said one of the peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Last year, it ap­plied for an on­line bank­ing li­cence with Sing­tel. The fi­nan­cial theme con­tin­ued in Fe­bru­ary when Grab raised about US$850 mil­lion from in­vestors in­clud­ing Mit­subishi UFJ Fi­nan­cial Group.</p>
    <p>For Asia-fo­cused in­sur­ers Pru­den­tial and AIA, investing in Grab Fi­nan­cial Group will al­low them to ex­plore the use of its tech­nol­ogy and data to market prod­ucts, said one of the peo­ple.</p>
    <p>It was not clear how much each in­surer planned to in­vest.</p>
    <p>Grab, which counts Didi Chux­ing and SoftBank Group among its in­vestors, has said its flag­ship app has clocked 198 mil­lion down­loads.</p>
