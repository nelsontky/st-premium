    <p>SHANG­HAI • As China counts the costs of its most pun­ish­ing flood sea­son in more than three decades, the role played by the mas­sive and con­tro­ver­sial Three Gorges Dam – which was de­signed to help tame the Yangtze River – has come un­der fresh scru­tiny.</p>
    <p>Amid some of the heav­i­est rain­fall on record, the gov­ern­ment says the world’s big­gest hy­dro-elec­tric plant has re­duced flood peaks, min­imised eco­nomic losses and slashed the num­ber of deaths and emer­gency evac­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>But crit­ics say the his­tor­i­cally high wa­ter lev­els on the Yangtze and its ma­jor lakes prove that the Three Gorges Dam is not do­ing what it was de­signed for.</p>
    <p>“One of the ma­jor jus­ti­fi­ca­tions for the Three Gorges Dam was flood con­trol but less than 20 years af­ter its com­ple­tion, we have the high­est flood­wa­ter in recorded his­tory,” said Pro­fes­sor Emer­i­tus David Shankman, a ge­og­ra­pher with the Univer­sity of Alabama who stud­ies Chi­nese floods.</p>
    <p>“The fact is that it can­not pre­vent these se­vere events.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ye Jianchun, China’s Vice-Min­is­ter of Wa­ter Re­sources, said at a Mon­day brief­ing that the “de­tailed sched­ul­ing” of wa­ter dis­charges from reser­voirs, par­tic­u­larly the Three Gorges, had been ef­fec­tive in con­trol­ling floods this year.</p>
    <p>He said 64.7 bil­lion cu­bic m of flood­wa­ter has been stored in 2,297 reser­voirs, in­clud­ing 2.9 bil­lion cu­bic m at Three Gorges.</p>
    <p>The com­pany run­ning the Three Gorges Project had said last Satur­day that down­stream wa­ter dis­charges had been halved since July 6, “ef­fec­tively re­duc­ing the speed and ex­tent of wa­ter level rises on the mid­dle and l ower reaches of the Yangtze”.</p>
    <p>The to­tal amount of stored flood­wa­ter has now reached 88 per cent of the reser­voir’s to­tal ca­pac­ity, it added.</p>
    <p>But parts of the Yangtze, its tributarie­s and ma­jor lakes like the Dongt­ing and Poyang have hit their record lev­els any­way.</p>
    <p>Dr Fan Xiao, a Chi­nese ge­ol­o­gist and long­stand­ing critic of gi­ant dam projects, said the stor­age ca</p>
    <p>Stor­age ca­pac­ity at Three Gorges as a per­cent­age of av­er­age flood­wa­ter, ac­cord­ing to Chi­nese ge­ol­o­gist</p>
    <p>Fan Xiao, a long­stand­ing critic of gi­ant dam projects. pac­ity at Three Gorges amounts to less than 9 per cent of av­er­age flood­wa­ter. “It can only par­tially and tem­po­rar­ily in­ter­cept the up­stream floods, and is pow­er­less to help with floods caused by heavy rain­fall in the mid­dle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Fan said Three Gorges and other ma­jor dam projects could even make flood­ing worse by al­ter­ing the flow of sed­i­men­ta­tion down the Yangtze.</p>
    <p>The project’s need to gen­er­ate elec­tric­ity has also un­der­mined flood con­trol, he said.</p>
    <p>“When peo­ple only con­sider us­ing reser­voirs to solve flood­con­trol prob­lems, they of­ten over­look or even weaken the nat­u­ral abil­ity of rivers and their lakes to reg­u­late floods,” he added.</p>
    <p>Prof Shankman said that although the Three Gorges Dam does help al­le­vi­ate flood­ing dur­ing nor­mal years, it was al­ways likely to be vul­ner­a­ble to more ex­treme weather, a prob­lem that is ex­ac­er­bated by shrink­ing flood plains down­stream.</p>
    <p>“The Three Gorges Dam reser­voir does not have the ca­pac­ity to sig­nif­i­cantly af­fect the most se­vere floods,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Flood­wa­ter stor­age along the mid­dle Yangtze is less be­cause of stronger lev­ees that are less likely to fail,” he added. “Both of those things are at play here. This was pre­dictable.”</p>
