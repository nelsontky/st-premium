    <p>DUBAI • Pa­trick Reed is very much in con­tention to be­come the first Amer­i­can to win the Race to Dubai ti­tle.</p>
    <p>He carded a su­perb eight-un­der 64 in the sec­ond round to take a two-shot lead over Matthew Fitz­patrick at the Euro­pean Tour’s sea­son-end­ing DP World Tour Cham­pi­onship yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Af­ter an open­ing round of 70 on Thurs­day that left him three shots be­hind overnight leader Vic­tor Perez of France, 2018 Masters win­ner Reed turned up the heat with five birdies on the front nine be­fore adding fur­ther gains on four holes af­ter the turn.</p>
    <p>The only blem­ish on his card was a bo­gey on the par-four 12th hole at the Jumeirah Golf Es­tates’ Earth Course but the world No. 11 said he was pleased with his ef­fort, hav­ing gone 10-un­der 134 for the tour­na­ment head­ing into the week­end.</p>
    <p>“Any time you shoot eight un­der, you’re al­ways happy. I feel like to­day, I got off to a lit­tle bet­ter start than yes­ter­day and the put­ter was work­ing a lit­tle bit,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Yes­ter­day, I felt like I did a lot of things pretty well, just putts weren’t re­ally fall­ing, was kind of burn­ing a cou­ple edges, a cou­ple iron shots weren’t as close as they needed to be, and to­day I tight­ened it up.</p>
    <p>“I was able to hit the ball a lit­tle closer, give my­self more op­por­tu­ni­ties and see­ing the lines a lit­tle bet­ter to­day.”</p>
    <p>At US$3 mil­lion (S$4 mil­lion), the DP World Tour Cham­pi­onship of­fers the sin­gle big­gest prize of any in­di­vid­ual tour­na­ment in golf, and who­ever is top of the stand­ings af­ter to­mor­row will also take home US$2 mil­lion as the Race to Dubai win­ner.</p>
    <p>While Reed is the favourite, the leader­board is still too close to call.</p>
    <p>Eng­land’s Fitz­patrick was eigh­tun­der over­all af­ter a sec­ond suc­ces­sive round of 68 while com­pa­tri­ots Tyrrell Hat­ton (68) and Laurie Can­ter (66) were tied-third, three shots be­hind the leader.</p>
    <p>English duo Tommy Fleet­wood (69) and Lee West­wood (68) were tied-fifth at six-un­der, while Perez dropped to tied-14th af­ter a dis­ap­point­ing round of 74.</p>
