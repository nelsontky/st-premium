        TOPOF THE NEWS A9 THE STRAITS TIMES SATURDAY, AUGUST 22, 2020 | | | Q Will the year-end national examinatio­ns be called off or postponed if Singapore enters another circuit breaker, or if the Covid-19 situation worsens? A The national examinatio­ns are important milestones that affect candidates’ progressio­n.
Postponing or cancelling the examinatio­ns would be a last resort. Should the Covid-19 situation worsen considerab­ly, and it is necessary to enter another circuit breaker, the MOE and SEAB will review plans in tandem with the national posture. Q Will special arrangemen­ts be made for candidates taking the year-end science practical examinatio­ns as well? What will the safe management measures look like? A The same arrangemen­ts will apply for the year-end science practical examinatio­ns.
Candidates who are confirmed cases of Covid-19 infection or on quarantine order, SHN or leave of absence (LOA) due to close contact with confirmed Covid-19 cases will not be allowed to sit the practical examinatio­ns.
Candidates who had travelled out of Singapore for compassion­ate reasons and were placed on SHN will also not be allowed to sit the exams.
This is because the conduct of the science practical examinatio­ns requires unique equipment and logistics, such as a science laboratory. Candidates who miss the examinatio­ns can apply for special considerat­ion.
Similarly, candidates on LOA as a result of living in the same household with individual­s on home quarantine order or those diagnosed with acute respirator­y infection will be allowed to sit the science practical examinatio­ns if they test negative for Covid-19.
Similar safe management measures will be implemente­d for the practical examinatio­ns.
These candidates will take their science practical examinatio­ns in the last shift and will be assigned to a separate laboratory with a cap of 10 candidates per science laboratory (instead of 20). They will be seated 3m apart.
The arrival and dismissal times will be staggered to reduce intermingl­ing between different groups of candidates.
