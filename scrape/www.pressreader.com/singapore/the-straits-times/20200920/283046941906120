    <p>Big mar­ket moves have al­ways at­tracted head­lines and in­vestor at­ten­tion. De­spite the broader and sig­nif­i­cant chal­lenges of 2020, most of us have ei­ther seen, no­ticed or heard about this year’s moves of the stock mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The big swings in March, early June and early this month have tended to gar­ner the most in­ter­est. As with past years, it could be the stakes, the quan­tum of risks or the lure of po­ten­tial re­turn. Per­haps it is more to do with an un­der­ly­ing ap­petite for knowl­edge or un­der­stand­ing, even more so than risk.</p>
    <p>There is no ar­gu­ment that big mar­ket moves are at­ten­tion-get­ting, and hence tend to be found in mul­ti­ple fo­rums in­clud­ing risk dis­clo­sures, a sen­si­tiv­ity anal­y­sis or stress test, ed­u­ca­tional re­sources and a Sun­day In­vest col­umn.</p>
    <p>This year, the big mar­ket moves have re­vealed the stand­out stock mar­ket driv­ers for 2020.</p>
    <p>RISE OF THE COVID-19 CASES</p>
    <p>The big­gest moves were in midMarch, with the key driver a surge in de­mand for the global re­serve cur­rency of the US dol­lar amid the un­cer­tain eco­nomic out­look as Covid-19 took hold of the world.</p>
    <p>The surge in de­mand for the green­back sent the volatil­ity of the trade-weighted US dol­lar in­dex fly­ing to lev­els it has reached only a hand­ful of times since 1983. The US Fed­eral Re­serve ap­peared to have re­solved the im­me­di­ate liq­uid­ity strain by March 23, with global cen­tral banks also mov­ing com­par­a­tively quickly to ini­ti­ate sup­port­ive mon­e­tary pol­icy mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Cou­pled with global fis­cal stim­u­lus, es­ti­mates of the global fis­cal re­sponse tally are 15 per cent of world GDP in the year thus far.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, the Ides of March showed that the ad­verse so­cial and eco­nomic im­pact of Covid-19 is the big­gest mar­ket driver of 2020 and as the Fed­eral Re­serve chair noted in prime-time TV to US house­holds in May, the big­gest mar­ket risk for the re­main­der of 2020 is resur­gent waves of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>RISE OF THE TECH AND HEALTH­CARE STOCKS</p>
    <p>The big mar­ket moves since March have been sec­tor-driven, in par­tic­u­lar tech­nol­ogy and health­care.</p>
    <p>Th­ese two sec­tors have been the strong­est across the world all be­cause the big­gest mar­ket driver of 2020 is the so­cial and eco­nomic im­pact of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy stocks that are re­lated to dig­i­tal or In­ter­net busi­nesses have fared com­par­a­tively well, as have stocks in health­care com­pa­nies that pro­duce and dis­trib­ute med­i­cal sup­plies, de­vices and equip­ment.</p>
    <p>This does not mean all tech­nol­ogy and health­care stocks have gen­er­ated gains. Brand­ing, mar­ket share and bal­ance sheets have re­mained im­por­tant fac­tors.</p>
    <p>Case in point is the ap­prox­i­mate 50 per cent gains so far this year for both the iEdge-Fact­set Global In­ter­net In­dex, and the iEdge US Tech­nol­ogy En­ter­prises In­dex, with the lat­ter com­pris­ing the top five largest com­pa­nies in tech­nol­ogy-re­lated in­dus­tries listed and domi­ciled in the United States.</p>
    <p>The strength of the tech­nol­ogy and health­care sec­tors and their im­pact on the global bench­marks have led many to ques­tion if global stocks in 2020 are de­tached from the hard eco­nomic re­al­i­ties that we cur­rently face.</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy, health­care and In­ter­net-ori­en­tated con­sumer stocks make up half the in­dex weigh­tage of the S&P 500, with the same three cat­e­gories mak­ing up more than a third of the in­dex weight of the FTSE All World In­dex.</p>
    <p>The me­dian to­tal re­turn of the top quar­tile of global tech­nol­ogy stocks by mar­ket value was 18 per cent from Jan­uary till Sept 4, and 21 per cent for the top quar­tile of global health­care stocks by mar­ket value.</p>
    <p>Hence, bench­mark re­turns have been sec­tor-driven, with the Covid-19 op­er­at­ing en­vi­ron­ments driv­ing the sec­tors.</p>
    <p>While tech­nol­ogy and health­care stocks have driven the bench­marks, the other sec­tors with the tougher op­er­at­ing en­vi­ron­ments were in no way for­got­ten.</p>
    <p>We have seen in­stances of ro­ta­tion into the lat­ter, in ad­di­tion to com­par­a­tively more de­fen­sive re­turns, while the tech­nol­ogy and health­care sec­tors have re­traced gains. For in­stance, up till Sept 4, the top quar­tile of global banks gen­er­ated a me­dian de­cline of 20 per cent, with the same mea­sure for global en­ergy stocks, see­ing a de­cline of 15 per cent.</p>
    <p>How­ever, prior to the resur­gence of Covid-19 in Texas, there was a week and a half, in early June, with a promis­ing out­look that the United States had over­come the worst of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Those seven ses­sions alone saw the S&P 500’s banks re­bound 18 per cent, its en­ergy stocks re­bound 17 per cent, while its tech­nol­ogy stocks rose just 3 per cent and health­care stocks fell 1 per cent.</p>
    <p>More re­cently, on the night of Sept 3, when tech­nol­ogy stocks de­clined 5 per cent, fi­nan­cial stocks saw only one-third of those falls.</p>
    <p>MOVES IN THE SIN­GA­PORE STOCK MAR­KET</p>
    <p>Most of th­ese big moves have ex­tended to the Sin­ga­pore stock mar­ket with sim­i­lar sec­tor-by-sec­tor per­for­mances.</p>
    <p>The big­gest Straits Times In­dex (STI) sec­tor is banks, and there are just two tech­nol­ogy plays – Ven­ture Cor­po­ra­tion and Maple­tree In­dus­trial Trust.</p>
    <p>With the big mar­ket moves since March be­ing sec­tor-driven, in­vestors have had to look be­yond the STI bench­mark. In­deed they have looked. Aside from Ven­ture Cor­po­ra­tion and Maple­tree In­dus­trial Trust, Sin­ga­pore’s top 60 stocks by turnover this year in­cluded AEM Hold­ings, Kep­pel DC Reit, NetLink NBN Trust, UMS Hold­ings and Hi-P In­ter­na­tional.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, while the STI is not home to any health­care stocks, Sin­ga­pore’s top 60 stocks by turnover this year have in­cluded Medtecs In­ter­na­tional Corp, River­stone Hold­ings, UG Health­care, Top Glove Cor­po­ra­tion Ber­had and Bi­o­lidics.</p>
    <p>Traders, with much more ap­petite for risk than in­vestors, typ­i­cally look for big mov­ing mar­kets. Hence, with a num­ber of health­care stocks see­ing ex­po­nen­tial moves this year, in­creased short­term trad­ing ac­tiv­ity and more liq­uid­ity in the broader mar­ket have sus­tained their turnover rank­ings and propen­sity to swing.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the re­cent earn­ings sea­son, com­mon Covid-19 sub-themes in the cor­po­rate out­looks in­cluded in­ten­tions to keep build­ing re­silience by con­tain­ing costs, lift­ing pro­duc­tiv­ity and, where pos­si­ble, pur­su­ing op­er­a­tional ex­cel­lence.</p>
    <p>Vig­i­lance was a word used many times and mostly ap­plied in the con­text of match­ing bal­ance sheets with op­por­tu­ni­ties to en­hance value. As un­cer­tain as the out­look for 2021 is, sec­tor-leader Kep­pel Cor­po­ra­tion said it would con­tinue to work as a group to de­liver value to its stake­hold­ers, with a bold long-term vi­sion, which tran­scends the im­pact of the cur­rent cri­sis.</p>
    <p>For the rest of 2020, the bank, real es­tate and in­dus­trial sec­tors will be large de­ter­mi­nants of the STI’s per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>The mega sec­tors, built on tra­di­tional strengths, will take their cues from the state of the econ­omy, as they have through­out the year.</p>
    <p>Ac­com­moda­tive mon­e­tary pol­icy and eco­nomic lock­downs have meant that global banks have had to con­tend with a sud­den re­duc­tion in in­ter­est rate mar­gins and over­all de­mand for fi­nanc­ing, while need­ing to boost loan pro­vi­sions.</p>
    <p>At the same time, real es­tate de­vel­op­ers, op­er­a­tors and man­agers had to grap­ple with ex­oge­nous de­clines in prop­erty sales and leases.</p>
    <p>At the end of 2019, trans­porta­tion-linked in­dus­tries made up one quar­ter of the com­bined mar­ket value of the com­bined in­dus­trial sec­tors of Asia-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>Th­ese three mega-sec­tors are very con­nected to cur­rent eco­nomic re­al­i­ties. At the same time, the STI will con­tinue to evolve, with the next-in-line stock to join the STI, Kep­pel DC Reit, with In­ter­net En­ter­prises mak­ing up close to 50 per cent of its ren­tal in­come.</p>
