    <p>Lions cap­tain Hariss Harun yes­ter­day re­vealed his dis­ap­point­ment af­ter Jo­hor Darul Takzim’s sea­son ended pre­ma­turely fol­low­ing the Malaysian cham­pi­ons’ an­nounce­ment they will not be par­tic­i­pat­ing in the AFC Cham­pi­ons League and Malaysia Cup.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment posted on the club’s so­cial me­dia chan­nels on Wed­nes­day, JDT tech­ni­cal direc­tor Alis­tair Ed­wards said they were in­formed by Malaysia’s na­tional se­cu­rity coun­cil that the team would not be given per­mis­sion to travel to Doha, Qatar for the AFC Cham­pi­ons League. It was post­poned due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic be­fore be­com­ing a cen­tralised com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, they re­cov­ered from a 5-1 loss to Vis­sel Kobe to beat Su­won Sam­sung Bluew­ings 2-1 to lie sec­ond in Group G.</p>
    <p>They were set to meet those teams again and play Guangzhou Ever­grande twice from Nov 19 to Dec 4 in a bid to get out of the group stage for the first time.</p>
    <p>Ed­wards said: “While JDT are ex­tremely dis­ap­pointed in not be­ing able to par­tic­i­pate in Asia’s high­est club com­pe­ti­tion and the Malaysia</p>
    <p>Cup, we re­spect the de­ci­sion by the Malaysian Gov­ern­ment and un­der­stand that such safety mea­sures need to be en­forced due to the ris­ing cases of the Covid-19 pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>The Malaysian gov­ern­ment has im­posed strict bor­der con­trols since March to con­tain the out­break in the coun­try, and also ex­tended an in­ter­nal con­di­tional move­ment con­trol or­der (CMCO) on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>This has af­fected the Malaysia Cup quar­ter-fi­nals that were sup­posed to be played yes­ter­day, with JDT sched­uled to meet Kuala Lumpur af­ter beat­ing Kuching 1-0 last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>It is un­der­stood that this year’s Malaysia Cup could even­tu­ally be canned.</p>
    <p>JDT skip­per Hariss said: “We haven’t trained this week be­cause of the CMCO, and as foot­ballers, the un­cer­tainty is frus­trat­ing be­cause our job is to train and play.</p>
    <p>“We are sad to be out of Asia’s elite foot­ball com­pe­ti­tion, but we also recog­nise some things like health and safety are more im­por­tant, and precaution is nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>“In any case, we can­not change the sit­u­a­tion, and we can only hope all the pre­cau­tions will pave the way for a safer en­vi­ron­ment as we look for­ward to play­ing all these tour­na­ments again next sea­son.”</p>
