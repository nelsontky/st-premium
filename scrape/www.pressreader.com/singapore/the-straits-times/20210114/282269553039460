        <p>A man who told his 11-year-old daugh­ter to con­sume sleep­ing pills af­ter a dis­pute with his es­tranged wife was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to six months and two weeks’ jail.</p>
        <p>The child lost con­scious­ness and was warded at KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal (KKH) for more than a month. The man later told the girl to lie to the po­lice by claim­ing that she had wanted to kill her­self and had taken the pills of her own ac­cord.</p>
        <p>She did as she was told, but came clean to a so­cial worker four months later.</p>
        <p>The 40-year-old Sin­ga­porean man, who can­not be named be­cause of a gag or­der to pro­tect his daugh­ter’s iden­tity, pleaded guilty in court on Nov 11 last year to one count each of ill­treat­ing a child and in­ten­tion­ally per­vert­ing the course of jus­tice. He also ad­mit­ted to an un­re­lated ha­rass­ment charge.</p>
        <p>The man lives with his daugh­ter in a Toa Payoh flat while his wife lives in Wood­lands. On April 7, 2018, the girl sent her mother a text mes­sage as she was feel­ing un­well. She asked her mother to pick her up from Toa Payoh so that they could visit a doc­tor to­gether.</p>
        <p>But the mother told the girl to take a taxi to Wood­lands as she did not want to meet her hus­band.</p>
        <p>The court heard that the girl de­cided to stay home with her younger brother and pa­ter­nal grand­mother. The man phoned his wife later that even­ing and they quar­relled.</p>
        <p>The girl was in the liv­ing room at about mid­night when her fa­ther told her to re­trieve a bot­tle of her grand­mother’s sleep­ing pills, which con­tained amitripty­line and can have harm­ful ef­fects. He told her to con­sume some of the med­i­ca­tion.</p>
        <p>Feel­ing over­whelmed, the girl swal­lowed about six pills. Her fa­ther later told her to con­sume more pills and she com­plied. When she lost con­scious­ness af­ter that, he took her in a taxi to his wife’s flat, call­ing for an am­bu­lance while they were on their way there.</p>
        <p>He placed the girl out­side his wife’s home and knocked on the door at around 3.45am on April 8, 2018. When his wife opened the door, he told her that she would be “an­swer­able if any­thing hap­pened to the vic­tim”. An am­bu­lance ar­rived soon af­ter and rushed the girl to KKH.</p>
        <p>The man later vis­ited his daugh­ter in hos­pi­tal and told her to lie to the po­lice. The girl lied to Sergeant Dick­son Lek on April 18, 2018, claim­ing that she had wanted to take her own life.</p>
        <p>In an un­re­lated in­ci­dent which led to the ha­rass­ment charge, the man was at Changi Beach Park on Jan 2, 2019 when a po­lice of­fi­cer asked for his NRIC. He then ver­bally abused the of­fi­cer and his col­league with vul­gar lan­guage.</p>
