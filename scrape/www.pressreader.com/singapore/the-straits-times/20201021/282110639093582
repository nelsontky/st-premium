    <p>Na­tional Kid­ney Foun­da­tion (NKF) chair­man Koh Poh Tiong will step down on Oct 31, af­ter hold­ing the po­si­tion for eight years.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh, 73, will be suc­ceeded by Mr Arthur Lang, 48, the chief ex­ec­u­tive of Sing­tel’s In­ter­na­tional Group, who joined the foun­da­tion as a board direc­tor in 2015.</p>
    <p>While an­nounc­ing Mr Koh’s re­lin­quish­ing of the post yes­ter­day, the foun­da­tion high­lighted his “re­mark­able con­tri­bu­tion in shap­ing and for­ti­fy­ing the poli­cies of cor­po­rate gov­er­nance, trans­parency and ac­count­abil­ity”, and “strong con­vic­tion that no one should be de­nied ac­cess to dial­y­sis in Sin­ga­pore due to their fi­nan­cial lim­i­ta­tions”.</p>
    <p>Un­der Mr Koh’s lead­er­ship, NKF in­vested in build­ing in­fra­struc­ture and ca­pac­ity, in­creas­ing the num­ber of com­mu­nity-based dial­y­sis cen­tres from 25 in 2012 to 38 now. Two more are in the pipe­line.</p>
    <p>NKF cur­rently serves more than 4,800 kid­ney pa­tients and ben­e­fi­cia­ries.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh also pri­ori­tised qual­ity care to meet pa­tients’ mul­ti­ple needs. The foun­da­tion in­tro­duced noc­tur­nal dial­y­sis to ben­e­fit pa­tients who re­quire longer hours of dial­y­sis for bet­ter treat­ment out­comes. This treat­ment is done over seven to eight hours as the pa­tient sleeps, in­stead of the usual four hours.</p>
    <p>In 2014, NKF es­tab­lished a $10 mil­lion Ed­u­ca­tion and Preven­tion Fund to in­vest in ways to boost kid­ney disease preven­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh, for­merly the CEO of Fraser & Neave, took over the chair­man­ship from Mr Gerard Ee in 2012. Mr Ee was ap­pointed to the role by the Min­istry of Health in 2005 af­ter the lav­ish life­styles of then NKF chief ex­ec­u­tive T. T. Du</p>
    <p>Mr Koh Poh Tiong (left), who steps down on Oct 31, will be suc­ceeded by Mr Arthur Lang, CEO of Sing­tel’s In­ter­na­tional Group.</p>
    <p>rai and three other board mem­bers were ex­posed by The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Koh: “I am pleased that my suc­ces­sor, Mr Arthur Lang, has agreed to let me pass the ba­ton to him. I have ev­ery con­fi­dence that, with his fi­nan­cial acu­men and depth of knowl­edge in cor­po­rate gov­er­nance and risk man­age­ment, he will help pre­serve NKF’s strong fun­da­men­tals and pro­pel it to greater heights to ben­e­fit our kid­ney pa­tients.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lang worked in the fi­nan­cial and real es­tate sec­tors prior to join­ing Sing­tel. He has pre­vi­ously served as a board mem­ber of the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity and cur­rently sits on the ad­vi­sory boards of the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity’s Lee Kong Chian School of Busi­ness and The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund.</p>
    <p>Not­ing the i mpact of the Covid-19 pan­demic on so­ci­ety, Mr Lang said it is crit­i­cal that in­sti­tu­tions like NKF con­tinue to serve with the right at­ti­tude and fo­cus, in­spir­ing the com­mu­nity to sup­port its pa­tients.</p>
    <p>“Our pa­tients’ needs are many and the NKF will con­tinue to do its ut­most to ex­tend care to all who need it. I’m deeply priv­i­leged to take on this role and to con­tinue to serve with my fel­low board mem­bers as well as the vol­un­teers and team at NKF,” he said.</p>
