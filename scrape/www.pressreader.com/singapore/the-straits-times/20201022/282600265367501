    <p>CAIRO • Egypt’s Mah­moud al-To­hamy is a master of Is­lamic chant­ing, a 1,400-year-old art form known as “in­shad” – but that has not stopped him from per­form­ing the Game Of Thrones theme song.</p>
    <p>At age 41, To­hamy is in­spired by the mys­ti­cal Sufi branch of Is­lam and deeply com­mit­ted to the spir­i­tual essence of the an­cient per­for­mance of de­vo­tional poetry and odes. But he has also earned global renown as an artistic pi­o­neer who fuses in­shad with other styles to cre­ate ex­per­i­men­tal and mes­meris­ing works of mu­sic.</p>
    <p>While the strictest in­ter­pre­ta­tions of the art of chant­ing bans the use of ac­com­pa­ny­ing mu­si­cal in­stru­ments, To­hamy has worked with Western-style rock bands and clas­si­cal mu­sic or­ches­tras. His lat­est projects, he said, are all about mix­ing “clas­sic Ara­bic with pop­u­lar mu­sic”, in­clud­ing gen­res from rock and pop to house.</p>
    <p>“We will be able to spread the clas­sic Ara­bic in the West as well as in lo­cal youth cul­ture,” he said of the chants, or “anasheed”, which are tra­di­tion­ally per­formed solo or a cap­pella. “Western and for­eign au­di­ences have an ear for in­shad, more than lo­cal au­di­ences. They may not un­der­stand the words, but they cer­tainly feel the mu­sic.”</p>
    <p>To­hamy was born to a fam­ily of re­li­gious chanters in the south­ern gover­norate of Asyut. His fa­ther was the singer Yassin al-To­hamy, one of Egypt’s most beloved re­li­gious artists.</p>
    <p>To­hamy has since 2014 run a mu­sic school in Cairo to pass the re­li­gious art form on to a new gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>He re­cently held a class – in­clud­ing young men, women and even chil­dren – in the spa­cious court­yard of the Mam­luk-era Prince Taz Palace in cen­tral Cairo. There, their lan­guid chant­ing echoed from the palace’s mu­rals bear­ing in­tri­cate in­scrip­tions of Kufic cal­lig­ra­phy and vi­brant Is­lamic art.</p>
    <p>So far, nine groups of stu­dents have grad­u­ated from the school af­ter at­tend­ing classes on melodic sci­ence, rhyming prose and Ara­bic phonol­ogy over a pe­riod of four to six months. “Our school wel­comes ev­ery­one with tal­ent from all ages, na­tion­al­i­ties and races,” To­hamy said.</p>
    <p>In­shad has mean­while gained ever more fans abroad, as has To­hamy. Over the years, he has per­formed at in­ter­na­tional mu­sic fes­ti­vals with the aim of “rein­te­grat­ing re­li­gious chant­ing in hu­man­ist art”.</p>
    <p>In 2017, he col­lab­o­rated on three songs for the United States al­bum Ori­gin, which won a prize at the Global Mu­sic Awards. Sev­eral of his youth­ful grad­u­ates per­formed on the French tele­vi­sion tal­ent show The Voice Kids.</p>
    <p>To­hamy has re­cently col­lab­o­rated with Egyp­tian mu­si­cian Fathy Salama, a Grammy Award win­ner, for the joint project Su­fism Vs Moder­nity, earn­ing wide global at­ten­tion. They had planned to per­form in Italy and Nor­way, but the shows have been de­layed by the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the gath­er­ing at Taz Palace, he asked stu­dents to per­form to the score of the block­buster tele­vi­sion fan­tasy se­ries Game Of Thrones (2011 to 2019).</p>
    <p>To­hamy em­pha­sised that stu­dents must be de­voted to the essence of the mu­si­cal form, and not give in to the trap­pings that come with its grow­ing in­ter­na­tional ap­peal and com­mer­cial­i­sa­tion. “It has be­come com­mon for pro­fes­sional re­li­gious singers nowa­days only to rely on tal­ent and ex­pe­ri­ence, with­out proper knowl­edge,” he said.</p>
    <p>To­hamy de­scribed him­self as “a lover of Su­fism”, which in­cludes rit­u­al­is­tic danc­ing, singing and the recital of prayers and is de­cried by some fun­da­men­tal­ist branches of Is­lam as “hereti­cal”.</p>
    <p>The master chanter, how­ever, said that Sufi Is­lam and its art forms have “played a ma­jor role in cor­rect­ing be­liefs and ideas in times of ex­trem­ism, vi­o­lence and ter­ror­ism”.</p>
