    <p>The ter­mi­na­tion of the Kuala Lumpur-Sin­ga­pore high-speed rail (HSR) project has drawn strong re­ac­tions in Malaysia, with two state govern­ments urg­ing the govern­ment to con­tinue with the project, while mem­bers of the pub­lic clam­our for more de­tails on what went wrong.</p>
    <p>Some said that while Covid-19 was partly to blame for the ter­mi­na­tion as the govern­ment needed to di­vert funds to fight the pan­demic, the multi­bil­lion-dol­lar project would have helped lo­cal economies re­bound faster from the deep slump.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral asked the Malaysian govern­ment to re­spond to Sin­ga­pore Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung’s ex­pla­na­tion in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day that the Repub­lic could not ac­cept Malaysia’s pro­posal to re­move As­sets Com­pany (As­set­sCo), the project’s sys­tems sup­plier and net­work op­er­a­tor, as it con­sti­tuted a “fun­da­men­tal de­par­ture” from the orig­i­nal agree­ment.</p>
    <p>In Me­laka state, where an HSR sta­tion was to be built, Chief Min­is­ter Su­laiman Md Ali said the project’s can­cel­la­tion has slightly af­fected a planned eco­nomic cor­ri­dor to join the planned Ayer Keroh sta­tion to an eco­nomic zone by the Strait of Malacca.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore this we were con­fi­dent that if the HSR has its sta­tion in Me­laka, it will def­i­nitely be a hub that can pro­vide abun­dant ben­e­fits to all,” Datuk Seri Su­laiman told re­porters on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The KL-Sin­ga­pore HSR project was ter­mi­nated af­ter Malaysia al­lowed the bi­lat­eral agree­ment to lapse on the dead­line of Dec 31, 2020.</p>
    <p>Jo­hor, which could have had three HSR sta­tions un­der the plan, hopes that the govern­ment will con­tinue with the HSR, with the line from Kuala Lumpur end­ing in Jo­hor Baru, said Men­teri Be­sar Hasni Mo­ham­mad.</p>
    <p>“Among the things we in Jo­hor hope for is that the HSR project would pro­ceed even if it does not in­clude Sin­ga­pore,” he told re­porters last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>There has been me­dia spec­u­la­tion of a re­vised align­ment of the HSR line, with the Jo­hor Baru ter­mi­nal end­ing near the JB-Sin­ga­pore Rapid Tran­sit Sys­tem (RTS) sta­tion. The 4km RTS Link is ex­pected to be com­pleted by 2026, link­ing Jo­hor Baru’s Bukit Cha­gar sta­tion to Sin­ga­pore’s Wood­lands North MRT sta­tion.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Mustapa Mo­hamed, Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Depart­ment, who was in­volved in the HSR dis­cus­sions, said that among the changes Malaysia was seek­ing was a new struc­ture that would al­low the govern­ment to avoid giv­ing a RM60 bil­lion (S$19.7 bil­lion) guar­an­tee for the project, for a 30-year pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With the Covid-19 pan­demic, the govern­ment is forced to find ways to re­duce the cost of sev­eral mega projects while en­sur­ing eco­nomic re­cov­ery, he wrote in a Face­book post yes­ter­day. “These de­vel­op­ments re­sulted in the orig­i­nal terms, which were signed un­der bi­lat­eral agree­ments in 2016, no longer be­ing vi­able for Malaysia,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral peo­ple left com­ments on the post ask­ing Mr Mustapa to re­spond to Mr Ong’s ex­pla­na­tion about As­set­sCo.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, for­mer Malaysian prime min­is­ter Na­jib Razak also took to Face­book yes­ter­day to weigh in on the is­sue.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to Mr Ong’s ex­pla­na­tion, Na­jib said: “In the past when I worked on this project, I de­lib­er­ately wanted both coun­tries to be re­spon­si­ble for the suc­cess of the project so that ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties could be re­duced or avoided.</p>
    <p>“But the PN (Perikatan Na­sional) govern­ment’s ap­proach is quite dif­fer­ent. They want to se­lect project con­trac­tors and ven­dors di­rectly with­out the in­ter­ven­tion of Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
