    <p>Bri­tain is brac­ing it­self for a back­lash from China, af­ter the gov­ern­ment of Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son con­firmed that Huawei, the Chi­nese tele­coms gi­ant, will no longer be au­tho­rised to sell or in­stall new equip­ment in the coun­try’s fifth­gen­er­a­tion (5G) wire­less com­mu­ni­ca­tion in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish mo­bile providers will be banned from buy­ing new Huawei 5G equip­ment af­ter the end of this year, and they must also re­move all the Chi­nese firm’s 5G kit from their net­works by 2027. New re­stric­tions are be­ing ap­plied to the com­pany’s broad­band hard­ware plat­forms.</p>
    <p>“This has not been an easy de­ci­sion, but it is the right one for the UK tele­coms net­works, for our na­tional se­cu­rity and our econ­omy, both now and in­deed in the long run,” Min­is­ter for Dig­i­tal Ser­vices Oliver Dow­den told MPs in London yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Huawei crit­i­cised the an­nounce­ment as “bad news for any­one in the UK with a mo­bile phone”. The Chi­nese com­pany also claimed that the de­ci­sion threat­ened to “move Bri­tain into the dig­i­tal slow lane, push up bills and deepen the dig­i­tal di­vide”.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish move – widely trailed by of­fi­cials over the past few days in an at­tempt to soften the blow of the an­nounce­ment – rep­re­sents a spec­tac­u­lar re­ver­sal in Bri­tish pol­icy to­wards China and vir­tu­ally guar­an­tees a back­lash from Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian told a reg­u­lar press brief­ing yes­ter­day: “Whether it can pro­vide an open, fair and non-dis­crim­i­na­tory busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment for Chi­nese com­pa­nies in Bri­tain will be a touch­stone of the UK’s mar­ket trend af­ter Brexit, and it is also a barom­e­ter of the safety of Chi­nese in­vest­ment in the UK. China will be watch­ing this closely.”</p>
    <p>Mr Liu Xiaom­ing, the Chi­nese am­bas­sador to London, has al­ready warned that the UK will “face con­se­quences” if it seeks to ban what is re­garded as one of China’s most suc­cess­ful in­dus­trial lead­ers.</p>
    <p>For years, Bri­tain stood out among Western na­tions in its in­sis­tence that Huawei should be treated purely on the merit of its prod­ucts, rather than by any po­lit­i­cal con­sid­er­a­tions. That was partly be­cause pre­vi­ous Bri­tish gov­ern­ments iden­ti­fied im­proved eco­nomic re­la­tions with China as their coun­try’s chief ob­jec­tive, but also be­cause the Bri­tish claimed to have pi­o­neered a bet­ter way of en­gag­ing with China’s high-tech com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>In­stead of treat­ing Chi­nese com­pa­nies with sus­pi­cion – as the US and many other Western coun­tries have done – the Bri­tish in­vited Huawei to es­tab­lish a sub­stan­tial pres­ence, and work with gov­ern­ment se­cu­rity ex­perts on test­ing the com­pany’s prod­ucts and soft­ware for po­ten­tial se­cu­rity flaws.</p>
    <p>The hope was that by en­gag­ing with Huawei and by en­cour­ag­ing other Chi­nese firms to en­gage with their Western cus­tomers in ad­dress­ing se­cu­rity con­cerns, not only would fu­ture hos­til­ity be avoided, but Bri­tain could also con­trib­ute to bet­ter cor­po­rate gov­er­nance among Chi­nese man­u­fac­tur­ers.</p>
    <p>“We’ve never trusted Huawei and we’ve al­ways treated them as a high-risk ven­dor,” Dr Ian Levy, the tech­ni­cal di­rec­tor at Bri­tain’s Na­tional Cy­ber Se­cu­rity Cen­tre (NCSC), which is part of the coun­try’s in­tel­li­gence com­mu­nity, ad­mit­ted ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment en­gaged with Huawei as a mat­ter of prin­ci­ple and pol­icy, and fun­da­men­tally dis­agreed with the Amer­i­cans on this point.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s ini­tial de­ci­sion to al­low Huawei to sup­ply part of the coun­try’s 5G in­fra­struc­ture, taken ear­lier this year, rep­re­sented a tri­umph for the Chi­nese com­pany, and a ma­jor re­buff to the US.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cially, the Bri­tish con­tinue to claim that their ear­lier ap­proval for Huawei was not a mis­take, and that they would have been sat­is­fied with Huawei as a sup­plier.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment is bas­ing its de­ci­sion to bar the Chi­nese com­pany on the fact that Huawei is now sub­jected to Amer­i­can sanc­tions, which means that the com­pany can no longer use US in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty or man­u­fac­tur­ing equip­ment, and es­pe­cially semi­con­duc­tors which are fun­da­men­tal to the tele­coms in­dus­try, a sec­tor in which China cur­rently lags.</p>
    <p>In short, what the Bri­tish are say­ing is that it is not them but Huawei which has changed, by no longer be­ing a cred­i­ble sup­plier of cut­tingedge com­mu­ni­ca­tion equip­ment.</p>
    <p>Still, it is ob­vi­ous that the de­ci­sion was a re­sult of in­tense pres­sure from Wash­ing­ton and the out­come of a broader de­te­ri­o­ra­tion in re­la­tions be­tween London and Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>China’s re­cent de­ci­sion to im­pose a na­tional se­cu­rity law on Hong Kong, a for­mer Bri­tish colony, cou­pled with what are seen in London as other hos­tile Chi­nese moves have em­bold­ened China crit­ics within the rul­ing Con­ser­va­tive Party, who have formed the so­called China Re­search Group, a pow­er­ful lobby of MPs who can no longer be ig­nored by Prime Min­is­ter John­son.</p>
    <p>Some of Huawei’s Bri­tish rep­re­sen­ta­tives are tak­ing com­fort in the fact that the ban on the sale of equip­ment kicks in only by the end of this year; they are hop­ing that, should for­mer vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den be elected as US pres­i­dent in Novem­ber, the de­ci­sion may well be re­versed.</p>
    <p>But that seems to be a pipe dream, for se­nior Bri­tish law­mak­ers see the Huawei de­ci­sion as ir­re­versible, and just the start of a big­ger con­fronta­tion.</p>
    <p>“Kick­ing our ad­dic­tion to Bei­jing tech needs to go fur­ther,” said Mr Tom Tu­gend­hat, chair­man of the for­eign af­fairs com­mit­tee in the Bri­tish Par­lia­ment, yes­ter­day.</p>
