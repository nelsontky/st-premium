    <p>An eight-year-old Amer­i­can girl was among two im­ported coro­n­avirus pa­tients an­nounced by the Min­istry of Health yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The de­pen­dant’s pass holder tested pos­i­tive on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The other im­ported pa­tient, a 39-year-old male work pass holder, tested pos­i­tive on Sun­day. He is an In­dian na­tional em­ployed here.</p>
    <p>The two, who had ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore from In­dia on July 12 and 13, were asymp­to­matic when tested, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>They had been placed on a 14-day stay-home no­tice upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, and had been tested while serv­ing their no­tice.</p>
    <p>The sole com­mu­nity case an­nounced yes­ter­day, a 29-year-old work pass holder, tested pos­i­tive on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The In­dian na­tional was iden­ti­fied as a con­tact of a pre­vi­ously con­firmed case, and had been quar­an­tined ear­lier.</p>
    <p>He was tested dur­ing his quar­an­tine pe­riod even though he was asymp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 356 of the 359 new coro­n­avirus cases an­nounced yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 51,197.</p>
    <p>No new Covid-19 clus­ters were an­nounced.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has also de­creased from 10 cases two weeks ago to four in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from a daily av­er­age of five cases to two over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 201 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 45,878 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 185 pa­tients re­main in hospi­tal, while 5,092 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. None is in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has also de­creased from 10 cases two weeks ago to four in the past week. The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from a daily av­er­age of five cases to two over the same pe­riod.</p>
