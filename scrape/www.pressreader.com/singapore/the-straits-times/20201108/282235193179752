    <p>NON-FICTION HOME IS WHERE WE ARE</p>
    <p>By Wang Gungwu with Mar­garet Wang</p>
    <p>NUS Press/ Hard­cover/</p>
    <p>287 pages/ $25.68/</p>
    <p>Avail­able at bit.ly/ HomeWWA_Wang</p>
    <p>On the eve of his­to­rian Wang Gungwu’s move from Kuala Lumpur to Can­berra, Aus­tralia, in 1969 – one of a long se­ries of up­root­ings through­out his life – his wife Mar­garet looked around at the house they were leav­ing, con­tem­plated what they were bring­ing and said to him: “Home is where we are.”</p>
    <p>Years later, this would be­come the ti­tle of the mem­oir they wrote to­gether, though Mrs Wang would not live to see it in print.</p>
    <p>Prof Wang, a Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore ( NUS) pro­fes­sor much gar­landed for his work on Chi­nese his­tory, pub­lished the first vol­ume of his mem­oir, Home Is Not Here, in 2018.</p>
    <p>The key shift be­tween the two parts, says the 90-year-old in an email in­ter­view, lies in the word “we”.</p>
    <p>“‘We’ be­came cen­tral to the story be­cause, as we be­came a fam­ily and made a home in Malaya, we also dis­cov­ered that it was pos­si­ble to un­der­stand that home did not have to be a coun­try, a city or a house, but could be found wher­ever we were.”</p>
    <p>Home Is Not Here spans his youth, from his child­hood – he was born in Surabaya, In­done­sia, and raised in Ipoh, Perak, while ever con­scious that his im­mi­grant par­ents held China as their home­land – to his 18th year, when he was called back from his stud­ies in Nan­jing to Perak.</p>
    <p>Home Is Where We Are chron­i­cles the next 20 years, be­gin­ning with his time at the nascent Univer­sity of Malaya, as the Bri­tish pre­pared to de­part Sin­ga­pore and a young English-ed­u­cated gen­er­a­tion of lo­cals grap­pled with how they might shape the na­tion to come.</p>
    <p>Then a bud­ding poet, he had his poems pub­lished in Pulse, a book­let put to­gether in 1950, which would come to be re­garded as the first book of po­etry pub­lished in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>That Sin­ga­pore’s lit­er­a­ture might one day hold its own on the world stage was a phe­nom­e­non few in the 1950s dared to imag­ine, he says.</p>
    <p>“In those early days, we were at the be­gin­ning of a de­coloni­sa­tion process that was to end with Sin­ga­pore be­com­ing part of Malaya. No one was clear what that Malaya would be like, ex­cept that it would be a coun­try of many lan­guages and cul­tures.</p>
    <p>“With the coun­try be­ing an­chored in the Malay States, the na­tional lan­guage could not be English. The of­fi­cial and le­gal lan­guage of gov­er­nance might re­main English in some parts of the coun­try and lit­er­a­ture could still be writ­ten in English, but that lit­er­a­ture would not be ex­pected to shape the na­tional iden­tity.</p>
    <p>“Had the 1965 sep­a­ra­tion from Malaysia not hap­pened, it is hard to imag­ine the ma­jor­ity of peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore us­ing English as their first lan­guage.”</p>
    <p>It was at univer­sity that he met fel­low stu­dent Mar­garet Lim, who caught his eye at a talk he was giv­ing about the poet Wil­liam Wordsworth. She would sub­se­quently marry and ac­com­pany him around the world as he pur­sued his aca­demic ca­reer, from Bri­tain to Malaysia to Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>His il­lus­tri­ous ca­reer would go on to in­clude be­ing Emer­i­tus Pro­fes­sor at Aus­tralian Na­tional Univer­sity, found­ing chair­man of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Pub­lic Pol­icy at NUS and for­mer chair­man of the ISEAS-Yu­sof Ishak In­sti­tute. In June this year, he was awarded the pres­ti­gious Tang Prize for Si­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther of the Wangs had in­tended to write their mem­oirs. About 15 years ago, Mrs Wang be­gan to re­gret that she did not know enough about her par­ents’ his­tory be­cause her mother had not told her about their lives.</p>
    <p>She thus set out to write her own story for their three chil­dren, who asked Prof Wang to do the same.</p>
    <p>“We had been liv­ing with a time­free con­ver­sa­tion be­tween us, but we never thought it would end in a book,” he says. Home Is Where We Are com­bines his nar­ra­tive with ex­tracts from Mrs Wang’s writ­ings.</p>
    <p>Mrs Wang died on Aug 7, aged 86, ahead of the book’s launch last month.</p>
    <p>Prof Wang be­lieves that if she were here to­day, she would say: “Yes, we made it. Home has in­deed al­ways been where we were.”</p>
