    <p>LON­DON • Tot­ten­ham Hot­spur man­ager Jose Mour­inho scolded out-of-favour mid­fielder Dele Alli on Wed­nes­day for a failed flick that lost his team pos­ses­sion and gave Stoke an equaliser i n a League Cup quar­ter-fi­nal the Pre­mier League side even­tu­ally won 3-1.</p>
    <p>“They got us in counter-at­tack. So yes, I was up­set,” Mour­inho said, af­ter hand­ing Alli his first start since Nov 26 for the game at se­cond-tier Stoke.</p>
    <p>Alli missed sev­eral chances to score, be­fore los­ing pos­ses­sion and al­low­ing Stoke a rare coun­ter­at­tack for Jor­dan Thomp­son to make the score 1-1 in a game Spurs had dom­i­nated un­til then.</p>
    <p>“For me, a player who plays in that po­si­tion is a player that has to link, that has to cre­ate, not cause prob­lems for his own team,” Mour­inho added of Alli.</p>
    <p>“First half we were solid. They didn’t touch the ball, or have a shot, or have a cor­ner. In­stead of killing the game, we kill our­selves.”</p>
    <p>He ap­peared to ad­mon­ish Alli as he sub­sti­tuted him soon af­ter Stoke’s se­cond-half goal, with TV footage ap­par­ently showing him say­ing: “Your flick has cost us that goal.”</p>
    <p>Al­ready ex­iled for long pe­ri­ods this term by Mour­inho and linked with a Jan­uary move to Paris Saint-Ger­main, Alli is a shadow of the player who shone dur­ing Eng­land’s run to the 2018 World Cup semi-fi­nals.</p>
    <p>Spurs re­cov­ered with goals from Ben Davies and Harry Kane to add to Gareth Bale’s opener for a com­fort­able pas­sage into the semi-fi­nals. Bale scored a header and was an in­flu­en­tial pres­ence, but did not re­turn for the se­cond half.</p>
    <p>“It was his de­ci­sion, some­thing he felt,” Mour­inho said. “While he was walk­ing to the dress­ing room, he told me he couldn’t come for the se­cond half... some­thing in his calf, I think.”</p>
    <p>Mour­inho was also cau­tious on the pos­si­bil­ity of his first piece of sil­ver­ware at Tot­ten­ham, who will face se­cond-tier Brent­ford while United take on Manch­ester City in the other semi-fi­nal.</p>
    <p>He said: “The teams that are go­ing to be there are very dif­fi­cult. Brent­ford for me, the way they play, they are not Cham­pi­onship, they are Pre­mier League.”</p>
