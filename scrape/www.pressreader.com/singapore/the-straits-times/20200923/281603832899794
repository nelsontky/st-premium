    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s real es­tate in­vest­ment trusts (Reits) have sur­vived the worst stretch of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and are now set to stage a broader re­bound. There were plenty of ques­tions over the fu­ture of Reits amid the mo­bil­ity curbs, but the sec­tor has per­formed sur­pris­ingly well in terms of share price and other val­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s real es­tate in­vest­ment trusts (Reits) have sur­vived the worst stretch of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and are now set to stage a broader re­bound.</p>
    <p>There were plenty of ques­tions raised about the fu­ture of Reits amid the mo­bil­ity re­stric­tions in the first half of the year, but the sec­tor has per­formed sur­pris­ingly well in terms of share price and other val­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the av­er­age gear­ing ra­tio of the Reit sec­tor stood at 36.4 per cent as at Aug 31 this year – well be­low the 50 per cent reg­u­la­tory limit.</p>
    <p>The FTSE ST Reit In­dex has re­bounded 38 per cent since the low point in March, eas­ily out­pac­ing the 13 per cent rise racked up by the Straits Times In­dex (STI).</p>
    <p>To be sure, the hit to unit prices at the on­set of the out­break in the first quar­ter has kept the sec­tor down by 9 per cent in the year to date com­pared with mi­nus 21 for the STI.</p>
    <p>Re­tail, of­fice and hos­pi­tal­ity Reits did suf­fer more than those in the in­dus­trial and health­care seg­ments.</p>
    <p>In­dus­trial Reits have been a par­tic­u­lar bright spot, with the global tail­wind from grow­ing e-com­merce pen­e­tra­tion likely to un­der­pin ro­bust de­mand for lo­gis­tics space.</p>
    <p>How­ever, with economies re­open­ing and curbs on move­ment and travel be­ing re­laxed, the per­for­mance gap be­tween these seg­ments of­fers an in­vest­ment op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts in­clud­ing DBS Bank’s Mr Derek Tan be­lieve the dis­count for Covid-19 im­pacted sec­tors is too wide to ig­nore and it is time for in­vestors to ven­ture out of safe in­dus­trial trusts.</p>
    <p>Reits have been pop­u­lar with in­vestors seek­ing a steady in­come from the rel­a­tively high div­i­dend yields they of­fer.</p>
    <p>The pay­outs come from the distri­bu­tion of cash flow gen­er­ated by the prop­er­ties that a Reit owns. The yield is cal­cu­lated by di­vid­ing ex­pected dis­tri­bu­tions over a 12-month pe­riod by the trust’s cur­rent unit price.</p>
    <p>The yield at­trac­tion has be­come even more com­pelling af­ter cen­tral banks world­wide cut bench­mark in­ter­est rates to his­tor­i­cal lows to help their economies re­cover from the pan­demic-in­duced re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>Cen­tral banks have flagged their in­ten­tion to keep rates lower for longer to sup­port re­cov­ery, but that also means yields on gov­ern­ment bonds will re­main de­pressed.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has also put a fo­cus on how re­tail, of­fice and hos­pi­tal­ity will rein­vent them­selves for the post-Covid world, and that fo­cus may re­sult in re­ju­ve­nat­ing the con­sol­i­da­tion wave that swept across Sin­ga­pore Reits last year.</p>
    <p>Reits here sealed $23 bil­lion worth of merger and ac­qui­si­tion deals last year, tripling the pre­vi­ous peak reached in 2014, ac­cord­ing to Bloomberg data.</p>
    <p>“Reits will re­main well sup­ported by in­vestors’ con­tin­ued ap­petite for yields and safe-haven as­sets, given the low rate en­vi­ron­ment and cau­tious global eco­nomic out­look,” said Mr Colin Ng, head of Asian eq­ui­ties at UOB As­set Man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>He said val­u­a­tions re­main more at­trac­tive than gov­ern­ment bonds, with Reits de­liv­er­ing an av­er­age yield of around 3.6 per cent more than the lo­cal sov­er­eign bonds.</p>
    <p>This yield spread is close to the long-term mean for Reits, which sug­gests they are far from over­val­ued, said Mr Ng.</p>
    <p>“Ac­cel­er­a­tion in on­line spend is ex­pected to drive the con­sol­i­da­tion and ra­tio­nal­i­sa­tion of re­tail stores,” he added.</p>
    <p>How­ever, if re­tail­ers can in­no­vate and build strong on­line plat­forms, a new omni-chan­nel busi­ness model may emerge that could mit­i­gate the neg­a­tive im­pact on re­tail Reits, said Mr Ng.</p>
    <p>Faced with on­go­ing border clo­sures, hos­pi­tal­ity Reits have re­pur­posed some of the ex­ist­ing lodg­ing space into niche work suites to cater to re­mote work­ing re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>The im­pact from so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures has been more im­me­di­ate for re­tail and hos­pi­tal­ity. But of­fice Reits also face long-term chal­lenges as the us­age of work space changes.</p>
    <p>Greater em­pha­sis on flex­i­ble work­ing ar­range­ments could drive busi­nesses to re-eval­u­ate and re­cal­i­brate their of­fice space needs.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan of DBS said the di­ver­gence in im­pact from Covid-19 is re­flected in the unit price per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>The over­all Reit sec­tor took a steep plunge in the first quar­ter, with the FTSE ST Reit In­dex slip­ping 22.9 per cent.</p>
    <p>How­ever, some of the l osses were re­couped in the sec­ond quar­ter when mo­bil­ity curbs were re­laxed. The Reit in­dex rose 13.8 per cent in the April-June pe­riod but the gains were largely led by Covidresis­tant in­dus­trial and health­care Reits.</p>
    <p>“This is un­war­ranted in our view, given the pos­i­tive mar­ket data points that flag to a grad­ual re­cov­ery in the econ­omy,” noted Mr Tan, who added that it is an op­por­tune time to start in­vest­ing in some of the un­der­per­form­ers.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX) is bet­ting on such strong in­vestor in­ter­est in the over­all sec­tor.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, it launched Asia’s first in­ter­na­tional Reit fu­tures – the SGX FTSE EPRA Nareit Asia exJa­pan In­dex Fu­tures and the SGX iEdge S-REIT Lead­ers In­dex Fu­tures – to­gether with six SGX FTSE Net To­tal Re­turn In­dex Fu­tures.</p>
    <p>The move to of­fer fu­tures con­tracts is one of the many ini­tia­tives the SGX has taken af­ter MSCI said in May that it would move li­cens­ing for deriva­tives prod­ucts on some in­dexes to Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Since the first ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO) of a Reit here in 2002, the sec­tor has grown faster than any­where else in Asia.</p>
    <p>There are now 44 Reits with a com­bined mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion of $101 bil­lion, rep­re­sent­ing about 12 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s over­all listed stocks. Notably, 38 of these Reits hold as­sets over­seas, giv­ing in­vestors an in­ter­na­tional ex­po­sure.</p>
    <p>Bloomberg data notes that the SGX has more for­eign Reits than any­where else in the world – a to­tal of seven for­eign-cur­rency-de­nom­i­nated trusts.</p>
    <p>Canada, Lon­don and Dubai have only two, Hong Kong has just one, and the United States, none.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore re­mains the pre­ferred list­ing venue for Reits. Out of the $3.1 bil­lion raised here last year, 98 per cent came from Reits.</p>
    <p>By con­trast, Hong Kong saw its first Reit IPO in six years with China Mer­chants Com­mer­cial Real Es­tate In­vest­ment Trust’s de­but last De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>Re­tail, of­fice and hos­pi­tal­ity Reits did suf­fer more than those in the in­dus­trial and health­care seg­ments... Some of the losses were re­couped in the sec­ond quar­ter when mo­bil­ity curbs were re­laxed. The Reit in­dex rose 13.8 per cent in the April-June pe­riod but the gains were largely led by Covid-re­sis­tant in­dus­trial and health­care Reits.</p>
    <p>IN DE­MAND</p>
    <p>Reits will re­main well sup­ported by in­vestors’ con­tin­ued ap­petite for yields and safe-haven as­sets, given the low rate en­vi­ron­ment and cau­tious global eco­nomic out­look.</p>
    <p>MR COLIN NG, head of Asian eq­ui­ties at UOB As­set Man­age­ment.</p>
