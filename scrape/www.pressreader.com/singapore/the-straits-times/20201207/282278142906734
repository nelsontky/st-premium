    <p>In just 10 months, a vac­cine de­vel­oped by Pfizer and BioNTech has been ap­proved by Bri­tain for emer­gency use to pre­vent Covid-19. An­other by Moderna is be­ing eval­u­ated for emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion by sev­eral reg­u­la­tors, in­clud­ing the United States Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>This 10-month time­line for vac­cines to get from con­cept to li­cens­ing is ground-break­ing; most take more than 10 years to reach this stage.</p>
    <p>Both these vac­cines de­liver the spike gene of Sars-CoV-2, the cause of Covid-19, in the form of RNA or ri­bonu­cleic acid.</p>
    <p>This al­lows the body to recog­nise and fight the virus should it try to in­fect the per­son.</p>
    <p>There are sev­eral other RNA vac­cines in the pipe­line, in­clud­ing the one our team at Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School is work­ing on in part­ner­ship with Arc­turus Ther­a­peu­tics. Here is the sci­ence be­hind such vac­cines:</p>
    <p>HOW RNA VAC­CINES WORK</p>
    <p>In the case of Sars-CoV-2, RNA vac­cines con­tain the ge­netic code for the char­ac­ter­is­tic spike pro­tein of the virus.</p>
    <p>When they are in­jected into our bod­ies, our cells read the code, and pro­duce and present the spike pro­tein to our im­mune sys­tem. Our im­mune sys­tem then re­acts and de­vel­ops mem­ory im­mune cells to re­spond specif­i­cally to the SarsCoV-2 spike pro­tein.</p>
    <p>Upon Sars-CoV-2 in­fec­tion, the mem­ory im­mune cells will be quickly ac­ti­vated to shut down in­fec­tion and pre­vent us from get­ting Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Such vac­cines con­tain only the spike gene of the virus, but lack the other Sars-CoV-2 genes re­quired to gen­er­ate new viruses, so vac­ci­na­tion will not cause the virus to spread in the body or make a per­son in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>The vac­cines, how­ever, will very likely re­main ef­fec­tive against the many mu­ta­tions of the virus be­cause the im­mune sys­tem is able to recog­nise and tar­get many dif­fer­ent parts of the spike pro­tein.</p>
    <p>Although RNA vac­cines have not been li­censed for use in hu­mans pre­vi­ously, they have been tested in clin­i­cal tri­als with ex­cel­lent safety pro­files so far.</p>
    <p>Many com­monly used vac­cines also con­tain RNA. Live vi­ral vac­cines, such as the yel­low fever vac­cine – ar­guably the best vac­cine in the world to­day, along with measles, mumps and rubella vac­cines – all con­tain vi­ral RNA. De­spite that, these vac­cines are among the safest and most ef­fec­tive in the world.</p>
    <p>SIDE EF­FECTS</p>
    <p>Some who took part in Covid-19 vac­cine clin­i­cal tri­als have ex­pe­ri­enced pain from the in­jec­tion. Some also ex­pe­ri­enced tran­sient red­ness and mild swelling at the in­jec­tion site.</p>
    <p>Sys­temic side ef­fects, such as headache and low-grade fever, are also com­mon fol­low­ing vac­ci­na­tions. This is mostly caused by our im­mune re­sponse. Our im­mune cells talk to one an­other by se­cret­ing chem­i­cals. These nat­u­rally pro­duced chem­i­cals, be­sides shap­ing the im­mune re­sponse, do also have un­in­tended ef­fects.</p>
    <p>A com­mon one that we all en­counter when our im­mune sys­tem re­sponds to a vi­ral in­fec­tion is the me­tal­lic taste in our mouths. How­ever, all these side ef­fects are mild.</p>
    <p>It is im­por­tant to note that these side ef­fects have come from phase one tri­als, which test a range of doses to find the high­est vac­cine dose that can be given to maximise im­mune re­sponse while keep­ing side ef­fects tol­er­a­ble.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, a phase three trial would test only a fixed dose that bal­ances the ben­e­fit of im­mu­ni­sa­tion with min­imis­ing side ef­fects.</p>
    <p>LAST­ING PRO­TEC­TION</p>
    <p>We do not know how long im­mu­nity will last fol­low­ing vac­ci­na­tion. It is pos­si­ble that it could wane with time and we may need booster shots.</p>
    <p>The public health au­thor­i­ties carry out sur­veil­lance to de­tect Covid-19 among vac­ci­nated in­di­vid­u­als should this hap­pen.</p>
    <p>Such sur­veil­lance would guide de­ci­sion mak­ing on whether and when booster doses should be given to sus­tain im­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>The jour­ney to devel­op­ing a Covid-19 vac­cine has been truly re­mark­able. It now adds a vi­tal piece to our abil­ity to push back Covid-19 and bring the pan­demic un­der con­trol. How­ever, vac­cines do not save lives. Vac­ci­na­tion does.</p>
