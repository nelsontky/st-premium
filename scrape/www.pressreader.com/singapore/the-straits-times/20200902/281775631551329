    <p>PU­TRA­JAYA • Long-term pass hold­ers from In­dia, In­done­sia and the Philip­pines will not be al­lowed to en­ter Malaysia from Mon­day, fol­low­ing a spike in Covid-19 cases in these coun­tries, said Se­nior Min­is­ter (De­fence clus­ter) Is­mail Sabri Yaakob yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He said the move would help pre­vent im­ported cases from be­ing spread across Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Cit­i­zens from the three coun­tries who will be af­fected in­clude those hold­ing per­ma­nent res­i­dent sta­tus, par­tic­i­pants of the Malaysia My Se­cond Home pro­gramme, ex­pa­tri­ates and pro­fes­sional visit pass hold­ers. The ban would also in­clude spouses of Malaysian cit­i­zens and stu­dents from the three na­tions.</p>
    <p>Many of them were still al­lowed to travel into the coun­try in the past few months de­spite tight re­stric­tions on travel.</p>
    <p>“The spe­cial Cab­i­net com­mit­tee is aware of the sud­den spike in Covid-19-pos­i­tive cases in cer­tain coun­tries,” Datuk Seri Is­mail said.</p>
    <p>“The meet­ing to­day de­cided to im­pose re­stric­tions on cit­i­zens of In­dia, In­done­sia and the Philip­pines en­ter­ing the coun­try.”</p>
    <p>Mr Is­mail said the govern­ment would also mon­i­tor the sit­u­a­tion in other coun­tries and did not rule out the pos­si­bil­ity that the same re­stric­tions might be im­posed on cit­i­zens of other coun­tries ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a spike in cases.</p>
    <p>“We have asked the Health Min­istry to make de­tailed plan­ning on how Malaysia should face threats and chal­lenges in view of the pos­si­bil­ity of an in­crease in cases dur­ing win­ter. We have started tight­en­ing bor­der con­trols by not al­low­ing peo­ple from the three coun­tries to en­ter,” he said.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment has raised its con­cern that coun­tries that ex­pe­ri­ence win­ter in the com­ing months would have more Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>Malaysia on Mon­day re­ported six new coro­n­avirus cases to bring the to­tal to 9,340.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of deaths linked to Covid-19 stood at 127, with one more death recorded on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 9,054 peo­ple have re­cov­ered.</p>
