    <p>Shares of Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings (SPH) surged yes­ter­day amid ac­tive trad­ing, prompt­ing a query from the bourse op­er­a­tor.</p>
    <p>The stock surged 10.5 per cent to hit $1.16 at around 11.08am, ac­cord­ing to ShareIn­vestor data. The last time the counter closed at such lev­els was in late July.</p>
    <p>It sus­tained its rally yes­ter­day af­ter­noon, jump­ing to $1.23 on a cum-div­i­dend ba­sis as at 3.38pm, up 17.1 per cent from Thurs­day’s close.</p>
    <p>Some 69.5 mil­lion shares had changed hands by then, mak­ing the counter the sec­ond-most traded by value on the Sin­ga­pore bourse, and fifth by vol­ume.</p>
    <p>About 65 large trades – each val­ued at more than $150,000 – were done dur­ing the morn­ing trad­ing ses­sion.</p>
    <p>It even­tu­ally closed 19.05 per cent higher at $1.25, with 85.6 mil­lion shares chang­ing hands.</p>
    <p>This rep­re­sented over 5 per cent of SPH’s is­sued and paidup shares.</p>
    <p>The News­pa­per and Print­ing Presses Act has, since 2002, pro­hib­ited any per­son from own­ing 5 per cent or more of a news­pa­per com­pany with­out ap­proval from the Min­is­ter for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries from the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change on the un­usual trad­ing ac­tiv­ity, SPH said it reg­u­larly eval­u­ates all op­por­tu­ni­ties across its port­fo­lio with the ob­jec­tive of en­hanc­ing share­holder value, which may in­volve dis­cus­sions with var­i­ous par­ties and stake­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>The com­pany added: “There is no as­sur­ance that any trans­ac­tion will ma­te­ri­alise or that any de­fin­i­tive or bind­ing agree­ment will be reached.</p>
    <p>“SPH will, in com­pli­ance with ap­pli­ca­ble rules, make fur­ther an­nounce­ments as ap­pro­pri­ate.”</p>
    <p>Last month, the stock briefly dipped below $1. The first time it did so was on the morn­ing of Oct 14, af­ter the board slashed div­i­dends as the me­dia and prop­erty group fell into the red.</p>
    <p>It fell again in the pe­riod of Oct 29 to Nov 2, to close at around 99 cents to 99.5 cents.</p>
    <p>SPH, which pub­lishes The Straits Times and The Busi­ness Times, rec­om­mended a fi­nal cash div­i­dend of one cent per share for its fis­cal year ended Aug 31, down from 5.5 cents a year ago.</p>
    <p>SPH Reit units also rose yes­ter­day, gain­ing 1.87 per cent to close at 82 cents.</p>
