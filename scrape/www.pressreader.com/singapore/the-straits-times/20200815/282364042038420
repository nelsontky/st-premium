    <p>As the Lions look set to write off more than one year of national team ac­tion, Sin­ga­pore coach Tatsuma Yoshida’s key word is trust, as he be­lieves his play­ers can con­tinue pro­gress­ing un­der his guid­ance once the in­ter­na­tional foot­ball cal­en­dar re­sumes.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, Fifa an­nounced that games sched­uled for Oc­to­ber and Novem­ber, in­clud­ing World Cup and Asian Cup qual­i­fiers, would be pushed back till after the new year be­cause of the coron­avirus cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The Lions were sched­uled to play Pales­tine in Al-Ram on Oct 8, host Saudi Arabia on Oct 13, and then play their fi­nal Group D game in Tashkent against Uzbek­istan on Nov 12 in the World Cup 2022 qual­i­fiers.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore are third with seven points in the five-team Group D after beat­ing Ye­men 2-1 away last Novem­ber. They lie two points be­hind lead­ers Uzbek­istan, and one be­hind sec­ond-placed Saudi Arabia. Ye­men have five points and Pales­tine are last with four.</p>
    <p>The top fin­ish­ers in each of the eight qual­i­fy­ing groups and best four sec­ond-placed teams will progress to the third round of the World Cup qual­i­fiers and also earn au­to­matic spots at the 2023 Asian Cup in China. The rest will still have a chance of reach­ing the Asian tour­na­ment through other means.</p>
    <p>Yoshida told The Straits Times that he trusts the Lions to con­tinue car­ry­ing out the tac­ti­cal con­cepts and philoso­phies learnt from pre­vi­ous national team train­ing ses­sions on their own.</p>
    <p>He added: “We had in­tended to call up lo­cal-based play­ers for cen­tralised train­ing next month if re­stric­tions were to ease. But, if we are un­able to, and with Fifa post­pon­ing the games in Oc­to­ber and Novem­ber, I am also trust­ing the var­i­ous lo­cal and for­eign clubs to keep the play­ers in the best pos­si­ble men­tal and phys­i­cal con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>“There are still three games to go and we have ev­ery chance of qual­i­fy­ing for the next round, so that will be our pri­or­ity.”</p>
    <p>Yoshida was not the only one dis­mayed by the post­pone­ment.</p>
    <p>Skip­per Hariss Harun, who is recovering from knee surgery in Sin­ga­pore be­fore he re­ports back to Jo­hor Darul Takzim later this month for the re­sump­tion of the Malaysian Su­per League, said: “The ab­sence of in­ter­na­tional foot­ball for more than a year feels weird, be­cause we are so used to get­ting to­gether once ev­ery few months to travel and play for the national team.</p>
    <p>“But this is the new nor­mal, and we have to adapt be­cause this is our so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>“Un­der coach Tatsuma, we were just get­ting used to his style and de­mands, and were show­ing signs of prom­ise.</p>
    <p>“When we even­tu­ally get back to­gether, we have to try and do that again. It is not go­ing to be easy, so it is up to us to help and push each other.”</p>
    <p>The 29-year-old felt it may be pos­si­ble for lo­cal-based Lions to play friendly matches against lo­cal clubs to get back into the groove when re­stric­tions ease in Sin­ga­pore. But he added that the national team have to pit them­selves against top Asian sides to im­prove.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, in Nor­way, striker Ikhsan Fandi is the first and only Lion to be play­ing com­pet­i­tively since recovering from a knee strain.</p>
    <p>The 21-year-old made two sub­sti­tute ap­pear­ances for Rau­foss in the sec­ond di­vi­sion this month, and hopes to make a big­ger im­pact soon.</p>
    <p>He told ST: “I was look­ing for­ward to the in­ter­na­tional games and rep­re­sent­ing Sin­ga­pore. But we can fo­cus only on what is ahead of us, and for me, that is club du­ties for now. Rau­foss have many games in a short pe­riod of time, so it is cru­cial for me to be ready at all times.</p>
    <p>“I feel great after recovering from the knee in­jury, and it is just a mat­ter of keep­ing my head down, work­ing hard, and tak­ing the op­por­tu­nity when it comes.</p>
    <p>“I also feel very lucky to be able to play and train while there are stricter re­stric­tions in some coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully, things will go back to nor­mal soon in Sin­ga­pore and my friends and team­mates can train nor­mally and start play­ing com­pet­i­tive games too.”</p>
    <p>I am also trust­ing the var­i­ous lo­cal and for­eign clubs to keep the play­ers in the best pos­si­ble men­tal and phys­i­cal con­di­tion. There are still three games to go and we have ev­ery chance of qual­i­fy­ing for the next round, so that will be our pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>’’ TATSUMA YOSHIDA , Sin­ga­pore national coach, on trust­ing his play­ers to train on their own and with their clubs.</p>
