    <p>Nearly 5,500 job open­ings are on of­fer in Sin­ga­pore’s health­care sec­tor, with three in four of them be­ing long-term po­si­tions. Close to 40 per cent of the long-term jobs avail­able are in pro­fes­sional and ex­ec­u­tive roles such as nurses, al­lied health pro­fes­sion­als, and fi­nance and hu­man re­sources ex­ec­u­tives.</p>
    <p>Nearly 5,500 jobs are on of­fer in Sin­ga­pore’s health­care sec­tor, with three in four of them be­ing long-term po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>Close to 40 per cent – or 1,530 – of the 4,080 long-term jobs avail­able are in pro­fes­sional and ex­ec­u­tive roles such as nurses, al­lied health pro­fes­sion­als, and fi­nance and hu­man re­sources ex­ec­u­tives. The other 2,550 open­ings are sup­port roles such as health­care as­sis­tants, ther­apy as­sis­tants and pa­tient ser­vice as­so­ciates.</p>
    <p>Sup­port and ad­min­is­tra­tive sup­port roles make up about 95 per cent – or 1,330 – of the 1,390 short-term jobs on of­fer. The re­main­ing short-term jobs are for pro­fes­sion­als and ex­ec­u­tives.</p>
    <p>These 5,500 jobs are part of the 6,700 job, trainee­ship and train­ing open­ings in the sec­tor as at the end of last month, the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) said in its weekly jobs sit­u­a­tion report yes­ter­day. There are also about 470 com­pany-hosted trainee­ships and at­tach­ments, as well as 760 train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Long-term pro­fes­sional and ex­ec­u­tive roles in­clude en­rolled and reg­is­tered nurses, who can earn be­tween $3,300 and $5,200 a month, ac­cord­ing to data on those who joined the health­care sec­tor in 2018, in­clud­ing ex­pe­ri­enced hires. The me­dian monthly pay for nurses is $3,900.</p>
    <p>The salary for al­lied health pro­fes­sion­als is $4,100 to $5,000 a month, with a me­dian of $4,400.</p>
    <p>Long-term health­care sup­port jobs in­clude roles such as pa­tient ser­vice as­so­ciates, who earn $2,400 to $3,000 monthly, with a me­dian of $2,700. Health­care as­sis­tants and ther­apy as­sis­tants earn be­tween $1,800 and $2,300 each month, with a me­dian of $2,100.</p>
    <p>Health­care has been among the top sec­tors of­fer­ing jobs and skills op­por­tu­ni­ties here.</p>
    <p>More than 80 per cent of the job open­ings are of­fered by pub­lic health­care clus­ters such as SingHealth, Na­tional Univer­sity Health Sys­tem and Na­tional Health­care Group, as well as com­mu­nity care or­gan­i­sa­tions such as Ren Ci Hos­pi­tal, Van­guard Health­care and St Luke’s Elder­care.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said about 8,350 peo­ple were placed into jobs, trainee­ships and train­ing po­si­tions in the health­care sec­tor be­tween April and last month.</p>
    <p>About 93 per cent were placed into jobs, the ma­jor­ity of which were short-term in na­ture, said MOM. These in­clude swab­bers and swab as­sis­tants to sup­port Covid-19-re­lated op­er­a­tions, as well as care am­bas­sadors and pa­tient concierge per­son­nel. Some of them have tran­si­tioned into long-term roles in the sec­tor.</p>
    <p>It added that cur­rent work­ers can also con­sider switch­ing to pro­fes­sional roles such as nurs­ing or al­lied health by tap­ping the pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s health­care sec­tor is sup­ported by a work­force of more than 100,000 peo­ple across both pub­lic and pri­vate sec­tors. About 70 per cent of it is made up of health­care pro­fes­sion­als such as doc­tors, nurses and al­lied health pro­fes­sion­als, while the re­main­ing 30 per cent com­prises sup­port care, ad­min­is­tra­tive and an­cil­lary work­ers.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has cre­ated temporary va­can­cies for a range of roles to sup­port in­creased test­ing op­er­a­tions. In ad­di­tion, health­care pro­fes­sion­als were mo­bilised to serve at Covid-19 fa­cil­i­ties and med­i­cal posts.</p>
    <p>At a vir­tual me­dia con­fer­ence, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said the sec­tor has been com­mit­ting re­sources to ex­pand the tal­ent pipe­line and equip ex­ist­ing work­ers with up­dated skills.</p>
    <p>“When peo­ple think about whether they will take up a ca­reer in health­care, they also see them­selves not just as tak­ing on any job... They also know that it is a pro­fes­sion that de­mands a very high level of com­mit­ment,” she added.</p>
