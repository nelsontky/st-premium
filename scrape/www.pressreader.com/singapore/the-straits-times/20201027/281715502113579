    <p>Al­though Sin­ga­pore has man­aged to re­duce new in­fec­tion cases to zero or just a few in the past few weeks, this does not mean that the coun­try has suc­cess­fully elim­i­nated Covid-19 from the com­mu­nity, ex­perts cau­tioned.</p>
    <p>Com­pla­cency could set in if peo­ple start let­ting their guard down, in the be­lief that the coun­try has tri­umphed over the virus.</p>
    <p>Strik­ing a cau­tion­ary note, Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, said Sin­ga­pore will not be safe un­til the world is safe, as the pres­ence of asymp­to­matic pa­tients could still lead to com­mu­nity spread.</p>
    <p>“From some of the global sur­veil­lance stud­ies, we un­der­stand that more than half of the in­fected peo­ple are asymp­to­matic. So, un­less we are able to screen ev­ery­one in Sin­ga­pore, and to do so in a re­peated man­ner, it will be un­wise to pro­ceed with the as­sump­tion that we have com­pletely elim­i­nated the virus in Sin­ga­pore,” Prof Teo said.</p>
    <p>“We are still see­ing a num­ber of im­ported cases ev­ery day, and even if peo­ple are quar­an­tined for 14 days, there could be the in­evitable leak­age if symp­toms man­i­fest af­ter 14 days.”</p>
    <p>The true num­ber of Covid-19 in­fec­tions is also likely higher than the re­ported cases, said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Alex Cook, an epi­demi­ol­o­gist at the Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health.</p>
    <p>“Take the case of some­one who is in­fected, di­ag­nosed and re­ported. But not ev­ery­one who is in­fected is di­ag­nosed, and this could be be­cause he is asymp­to­matic, or not go­ing to a doc­tor when ill,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I am con­fi­dent about Sin­ga­pore’s cur­rent test­ing ca­pac­ity and that we are pick­ing up lots of oth­er­wise un­de­tected cases, maybe as many as half of the true num­ber of in­fec­tions out there, but it is un­re­al­is­tic to ex­pect we (will) find them all.”</p>
    <p>Prof Cook said that hav­ing zero com­mu­nity cases should not be the tar­get, even if it is laud­able and “sounds like a good num­ber”, as it could breed a sense of com­pla­cency.</p>
    <p>“The threat of Covid-19 will re­main un­til we have mass vac­ci­na­tion,” he warned.</p>
    <p>With Sin­ga­pore eas­ing travel ar­range­ments with other coun­tries as well as grad­u­ally re­lax­ing re­stric­tions around so­cial and recre­ational ac­tiv­i­ties, in­ter­ac­tions be­tween peo­ple will in­crease, and in­fec­tion im­por­ta­tion risks will also edge higher, said Prof Teo.</p>
    <p>When this hap­pens, the need to re­tain pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures such as mask wear­ing, strict per­sonal hy­giene and so­cial dis­tanc­ing be­comes even more crit­i­cal, he added.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher, a se­nior con­sul­tant at the di­vi­sion of in­fec­tious dis­eases at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hospi­tal, said that for the virus to be erad­i­cated, one would gen­er­ally have to look at two in­cu­ba­tion pe­ri­ods, or 28 days in the case of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, even at that point, one would be re­luc­tant to make the claim be­cause of asymp­to­matic spread... and it is pos­si­ble that there could be a few gen­er­a­tions of asymp­to­matic spread, and then cases could ap­pear,” ar­gued Prof Fisher.</p>
    <p>He also pointed out that it could be tricky try­ing to es­ti­mate the pro­por­tion of asymp­to­matic cases, given the wide vari­a­tion in es­ti­mated per­cent­ages and that peo­ple do have dif­fer­ent thresh­olds be­fore re­port­ing symp­toms.</p>
    <p>Prof Fisher also noted that there is sig­nif­i­cant asymp­to­matic spread, with stud­ies show­ing that the pro­por­tion of such cases could range from less than 10 per cent to around 90 per cent of all Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>“I would say a rea­son­able es­ti­mate is about 40 per cent. Thus, it re­mains im­por­tant to con­tinue all in­fec­tion pre­ven­tion mea­sures,” he stressed.</p>
    <p>“Zero cases is cer­tainly nice, but I wouldn’t sup­port zero tol­er­ance for cases. That would make the bor­der re­stric­tions harder to lift. I still think the aim should be to live with the virus while min­imis­ing case num­bers. Se­lec­tive nu­anced bor­der open­ings are im­por­tant for ev­ery coun­try to avoid more so­cial and eco­nomic harm be­ing done.”</p>
