    <p>De­signed with mil­len­ni­als and Gen­er­a­tion Z in mind, Sam­sung’s The Sero smart TV has the abil­ity to switch its 43-inch screen be­tween por­trait and land­scape ori­en­ta­tion with the press of a but­ton.</p>
    <p>Look­ing like a tall stand­ing mir­ror, The Sero’s screen is perched on a stand an­gled at 76 de­grees, with a set of built-in 60W (4.1-chan­nel) front-fac­ing speak­ers sited be­low.</p>
    <p>It even has op­tional wheels ($199) for users to roll it around the home.</p>
    <p>The best part about The Sero is that users can mir­ror what they are watch­ing on com­pat­i­ble smart­phones or tablets on its big screen in por­trait ori­en­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>This means TikTok or In­sta­gram Sto­ries videos can now be dis­played in full glory, while scru­ti­n­is­ing self­ies has never been eas­ier.</p>
    <p>As you might ex­pect, The Sero works bet­ter with sup­ported Sam­sung Galaxy smart­phones via the Tap View fea­ture. It al­lows you to en­able mir­ror­ing by tap­ping any­where on the bezel of the smart­phone’s screen.</p>
    <p>How­ever, be­fore you do that, you need to down­load the new SmartThing­s app (avail­able on An­droid and iOS) and activate the Tap View func­tion.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing mir­ror­ing, the screen will ro­tate in step with the app you are us­ing. So, with In­sta­gram, for in­stance, the screen will be in por­trait ori­en­ta­tion. But it will au­to­mat­i­cally ro­tate to land­scape ori­en­ta­tion when you start a rac­ing game like As­phalt 9.</p>
    <p>Even though the SmartThing­s app is avail­able on iOS, iPhones and iPads do not sup­port the Tap View fea­ture. But The Sero sup­ports Ap­ple’s AirPlay 2 stream­ing pro­to­col, so you can still stream con­tent from your iPhone to the TV.</p>
    <p>Run­ning Sam­sung’s Tizen smart TV op­er­at­ing sys­tem, The Sero comes pre-loaded with the most pop­u­lar con­tent-stream­ing apps, such as Net­flix, Ama­zon Prime, HBO Go, Ap­pleTV, YouTube and Viu.</p>
    <p>The Sero is also no slouch in terms of im­age qual­ity. It fea­tures Sam­sung’s Quan­tum Dot tech­nol­ogy that is said to pro­duce 100 per cent real colour based on the DCI-P3 stan­dard.</p>
    <p>Watch­ing any con­tent on The Sero is a joy with its sharp res­o­lu­tion as well as its bright colours. Au­dio qual­ity is also im­pres­sive, with punchy bass and clear vo­cals.</p>
    <p>I also like that I can mir­ror my favourite mo­bile games such as Ro­bot Wars and As­phalt 9 on the big screen. It is like hav­ing a gam­ing con­sole with­out buy­ing one.</p>
    <p>There are two other fea­tures of The Sero that I like. One is Adap­tive Pic­ture, which au­to­mat­i­cally ad­justs the TV’s bright­ness to the view­ing en­vi­ron­ment to en­sure an op­ti­mal view­ing ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>The other is Ac­tive Voice Am­pli­fier, which am­pli­fies voices in any video so di­a­logue can be heard clearly.</p>
    <p>Both worked as ad­ver­tised. I opened and closed the cur­tains in my liv­ing room and saw the bright­ness of the TV change ac­cord­ingly.</p>
    <p>Play­ing loud mu­sic in the liv­ing room trig­gered an in­crease in the vol­ume of the di­a­logue of a Korean va­ri­ety show I was watch­ing on Viu.</p>
    <p>Stand­ing next to my own 55-inch TV, The Sero looks huge when the screen is in por­trait ori­en­ta­tion. But when the screen is in land­scape ori­en­ta­tion, it looks small, like a reg­u­lar TV.</p>
    <p>As such, The Sero is prob­a­bly best suited as a sec­ond TV – al­beit a rather ex­pen­sive one – for so­cial me­dia con­sump­tion and play­ing games.</p>
    <p>Con­sid­er­ing that a stan­dard 43-inch ul­tra high-def­i­ni­tion TV costs at most $1,000 these days, the $3,499 price tag of The Sero is quite steep.</p>
    <p>Of course, no other TV on the mar­ket that I know of has this jaw­drop­ping party trick of me­chan­i­cally ro­tat­ing its dis­play.</p>
