    <p>The find­ing in a sur­vey re­leased this month, that 36 per cent of those polled were un­sure whether trays should be re­turned in food es­tab­lish­ments, has sparked lively de­bate in the Fo­rum pages of this news­pa­per. One reader has ar­gued that Sin­ga­pore has strict anti-littering laws which are en­forced against re­cal­ci­trant litterbugs. If it is an of­fence to dis­card used tis­sue pa­per on path­ways, then there should also be a penalty for leav­ing the same item on hawker cen­tre ta­bles. Hence the need for laws to be ex­panded to in­clude leav­ing trays and other left­overs in pub­lic places. So goes the ar­gu­ment. Of course, the counter-ar­gu­ment is that left­overs on trays and ta­bles are not lit­ter and so do not fall within the am­bit of the law. To bring th­ese into that am­bit would ap­pear to stretch the ar­gu­ment. It would be bet­ter to per­sist with the per­sua­sive ap­proach to change so­cial be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>Re­turn­ing trays clears space for oth­ers, which is a ne­ces­sity par­tic­u­larly dur­ing lunch and din­ner pe­ri­ods in hawker cen­tres and food­courts. It re­duces the bur­den on clean­ers, not least the el­derly, who can work faster and more ef­fi­ciently af­ter trays and crock­ery have been placed at re­ceiv­ing sta­tions. Im­por­tantly, the re­turn­ing of trays pre­vents pi­geons and other birds from feed­ing off un­eaten food. This com­mon oc­cur­rence is a health haz­ard – and con­cerns about health have been ex­ac­er­bated by the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans are con­scious of it, but aware­ness does not al­ways trans­late into ac­tion. In­stead, what ap­pears to pre­vail among many is a mind­set that re­turn­ing trays should be vol­un­tary. It is here that the threat of penal­ties, in what­ever form, might be a use­ful har­bin­ger of change. En­force­ment does change so­cial be­hav­iour, as is ap­par­ent for littering, for ex­am­ple. The same could be true of un­hy­gienic prac­tices in pub­lic, and es­pe­cially so at this time. But the hope re­mains that com­mon sense and so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity will pre­vail.</p>
