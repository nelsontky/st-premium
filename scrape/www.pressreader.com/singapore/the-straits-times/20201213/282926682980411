    <p>• Jur­gen Klopp has in­sisted that Alex Oxlade-Cham­ber­lain is a “dif­fer­ence maker” in the team, af­ter a ques­tion was posed about the like­li­hood of the mid­fielder reach­ing his pre­vi­ous heights again at Liver­pool.</p>
    <p>“In train­ing, what Ox did so far, you see his qual­ity im­me­di­ately, im­me­di­ately,” Klopp said on the club web­site ahead of to­day’s Premier</p>
    <p>League trip to Ful­ham.</p>
    <p>“He is a dif­fer­ence maker, you can see that. Be­ing in the best mo­ment of your ca­reer and be­ing com­pared with that af­ter com­ing back from an in­jury, that’s a re­ally dumb thing to do.</p>
    <p>“Ox is an out­stand­ing player, an out­stand­ing player. He was al­ways and will al­ways be.”</p>
    <p>The 27-year-old English­man has not fea­tured this sea­son due to a knee is­sue but Klopp was boosted by his re­turn to train­ing this week.</p>
    <p>The Reds boss added that goal­keeper Alis­son Becker has also re­sumed train­ing af­ter a ham­string in­jury and could re­turn to­day.</p>
    <p>Alis­son has not played since Liver­pool’s 1-1 draw against Brighton last month and Klopp said the Brazil­ian was close to full fit­ness.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the good news was bal­anced with some less ap­petis­ing up­dates, with Klopp con­firm­ing that he was wait­ing to hear about the se­ri­ous­ness of knocks suf­fered by Kostas Tsimikas and Diogo Jota dur­ing the mid­week 1-1 Cham­pi­ons League draw at Midtjyl­land.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool are sec­ond in the league be­hind Tot­ten­ham on goal dif­fer­ence and host Jose Mour­inho’s side next week af­ter the clash against 17th-placed Ful­ham.</p>
    <p>“I hope none of our play­ers will think about Tot­ten­ham when we’re at Ful­ham,” Klopp said.</p>
    <p>“Ful­ham are a re­ally good side and the per­for­mances they’ve shown have all not been re­warded with re­sults. Since Scott Parker took over there, there’s been con­stant devel­op­ment. He’s do­ing a good job, I re­spect that.”</p>
    <p>The Ger­man also re­it­er­ated that he be­lieves the need for VAR (video as­sis­tant ref­eree) has made the game less en­joy­able, af­ter Liver­pool were in­volved in three lengthy stop­pages against Midtjyl­land.</p>
    <p>“We stop cel­e­brat­ing goals, we wait con­stantly, we have less than mil­lime­tre off­side de­ci­sions. A lot of things are not like they were be­fore, that’s the truth,” he said.</p>
