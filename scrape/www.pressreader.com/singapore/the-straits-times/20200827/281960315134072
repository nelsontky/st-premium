    <p>To Bei­jing, the United States’ de facto am­bas­sador’s par­tic­i­pa­tion over the week­end in a cer­e­mony com­mem­o­rat­ing a 1958 mil­i­tary con­fronta­tion be­tween China and Tai­wan was noth­ing short of provoca­tive. The event marked the at­tacks on Kin­men and Matsu is­lands by China, which the Tai­wanese forces re­pelled with sup­port from the US. It was the first time that the un­of­fi­cial en­voy took part in the cer­e­mony. Bei­jing was scathing in its re­sponse on Mon­day, ac­cus­ing the US of play­ing the Tai­wan card in their bi­lat­eral ties. It also called the US-Tai­wan se­cu­rity co­op­er­a­tion in 1958 a “shame­ful” mo­ment in which the US tried to stop the re­uni­fi­ca­tion of the main­land and Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>This week’s episode was one of sev­eral in the past months that have height­ened ten­sions in the Tai­wan Strait and, for some, in­creased the risk of a mil­i­tary con­flict. In par­tic­u­lar, US moves to strengthen ties with Tai­wan – which Bei­jing con­sid­ers a break­away prov­ince to be re­uni­fied, by force if nec­es­sary – have an­gered China. Un­der Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, the US en­acted laws that al­lowed US war­ships to make port calls and se­nior of­fi­cials to visit Tai­wan, over­turn­ing pre­vi­ous taboos. It also in­creased arms sales to the is­land. Health Sec­re­tary Alex Azar vis­ited Taipei this month, the most se­nior US of­fi­cial to do so in four decades. Bei­jing re­acted to the last by fly­ing jets over the me­dian line in the Tai­wan Strait and hold­ing large-scale ex­er­cises in the wa­ter­way.</p>
    <p>China it­self has added to the ten­sion in the strait by as­sert­ing in late May that it re­served the op­tion of us­ing force to stop sep­a­ratist ac­tions in Tai­wan. These were fol­lowed by a spike in Chi­nese mil­i­tary ac­tiv­ity in the Tai­wan Strait, in­clud­ing mis­sile­fir­ing ex­er­cises and in­cur­sions into Tai­wan’s air de­fence iden­ti­fi­ca­tion zone by Chi­nese jets. It is, there­fore, not sur­pris­ing that Tai­wan should wel­come US over­tures and lean to­wards Wash­ing­ton for its se­cu­rity needs. This is as cross-strait ties are at a low point since Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing-wen of the in­de­pen­dence-lean­ing Demo­cratic Pro­gres­sive Party came to power in 2016.</p>
    <p>All these de­vel­op­ments have made the Tai­wan Strait a flash­point at a time when US-China ten­sions have risen. Mr Trump has made a tough stance on China a key el­e­ment of his Nov 3 re-elec­tion bid. But any small mis­judg­ment could trig­ger con­flict, es­pe­cially when mis­trust has height­ened on all sides. Cooler heads must pre­vail in Bei­jing too, es­pe­cially as it recog­nises that much of the drum beat­ing on the US side is more for do­mes­tic con­sump­tion. The US also needs to avoid push­ing things to the brink as this will have reper­cus­sions on it be­yond Novem­ber. Taipei, for its part, needs to tread a care­ful bal­ance be­tween the two pow­ers if it wants peace and sta­bil­ity in the Tai­wan Strait, given that some in the is­land have warned that there is no cer­tainty the US will come to its aid should there be war.</p>
