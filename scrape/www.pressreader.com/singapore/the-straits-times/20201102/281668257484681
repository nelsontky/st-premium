    <p>At a time when Sin­ga­pore’s res­i­dent un­em­ploy­ment rate is 4.7 per cent, there are as many as 84,400 po­si­tions that are wait­ing to be filled.</p>
    <p>About 117, 500 new jobs, train­ing and at­tach­ment po­si­tions were cre­ated by the Na­tional Jobs Coun­cil by end-Au­gust – sur­pass­ing the orig­i­nal 100,000 tar­get. How­ever, only 33,100 lo­cal job seek­ers have been placed in th­ese roles, a jobs sit­u­a­tion re­port by the Man­power Min­istry re­vealed on Oct 7.</p>
    <p>The anoma­lous sit­u­a­tion is be­cause job seek­ers are doubt­ful about switch­ing to un­fa­mil­iar roles and em­ploy­ers are pick­ier and cau­tious, look­ing out for the best can­di­dates for the role.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers told The Straits Times that the chal­lenge is not so much can­di­dates hav­ing the re­quired skills for a job – em­ploy­ees can be trained – but the mis­matched ex­pec­ta­tions of both job seek­ers and em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>RESER­VA­TIONS ABOUT</p>
    <p>SWITCH­ING TO UN­FA­MIL­IAR ROLES</p>
    <p>Over the years, Sin­ga­pore­ans have built up the ex­pec­ta­tion that good jobs – with rea­son­able salaries and steady pro­gres­sion – are avail­able to them, but Covid-19 has chal­lenged that think­ing, said ob­servers, adding that job seek­ers can­not af­ford to wait it out in such an un­cer­tain job mar­ket now.</p>
    <p>Most of the op­por­tu­ni­ties con­tinue to arise in growth sec­tors. The top five are: in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions, health­care, pro­fes­sional ser­vices, fi­nance and in­sur­ance, and man­u­fac­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>About 70 per cent of the op­por­tu­ni­ties of­fered were jobs, in­clud­ing roles such as soft­ware de­vel­op­ers, ser­vice en­gi­neers and nurses.</p>
    <p>Sec­tors with many un­filled va­can­cies in­clude health­care and early child­hood ed­u­ca­tion, said Sin­ga­pore Hu­man Re­sources In­sti­tute pres­i­dent Low Peck Kem.</p>
    <p>Work­ers made re­dun­dant or seek­ing new roles may be com­ing from hard-hit sec­tors, and may not be equipped to fill open­ings in ar­eas of need and growth sec­tors, she added. “If they have not been in­vest­ing in con­tin­u­ous up­grad­ing to be ready for the fu­ture, then clearly there will be a mis­match be­tween ex­pec­ta­tions and skills.”</p>
    <p>Work­ers are more re­luc­tant to move to a new sec­tor when they have al­ready in­vested time and ef­fort in hon­ing their skills in their pre­vi­ous roles, said Ms Low, adding that their job search will likely take at least three months.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers need to be pro­gres­sive and look be­yond can­di­dates who can “plug-and-play” im­me­di­ately, she said. “Em­ploy­ers are more likely to be suc­cess­ful in find­ing a match if they fo­cus on can­di­dates’ trans­fer­able skills and tap gov­ern­ment fund­ing sup­port to bridge skills gaps; for sun­rise in­dus­tries, the skills needed tend to be in short sup­ply and it does take time to train and ac­quire such skills.”</p>
    <p>Job seek­ers too, may also be placed more quickly if they keep an open mind and con­sider less fa­mil­iar roles or sec­tors, even tak­ing up ca­reer con­ver­sion pro­grammes to tran­si­tion into new roles with longer-term op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>As at end-Au­gust, the sec­tors where most work­ers were placed were in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions, food ser­vices, pro­fes­sional ser­vices, health­care, and fi­nance and in­sur­ance.</p>
    <p>Th­ese man­power-hun­gry sec­tors have al­ways been hir­ing in large num­bers, even pre-pan­demic, said Peo­pleWorld­wide Con­sult­ing manag­ing direc­tor David Leong.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that Sin­ga­pore has cre­ated thou­sands of job op­por­tu­ni­ties in the past few months, he said it is about how job seek­ers can adapt and move on to a new ca­reer track. “Skills are not a ma­jor con­cern, as they are not dif­fi­cult to learn,” he ex­plained.</p>
    <p>Job seek­ers should “learn to fit to the job to sur­vive”, even if it is not their first choice, he said. “It’s not the time to be choosy. When nor­malcy and bet­ter times re­turn, th­ese work­ers can re-eval­u­ate their op­tions with fu­ture op­por­tu­ni­ties.”</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers too, noted that va­can­cies can be filled faster if job seek­ers over­come their reser­va­tions about switch­ing to less fa­mil­iar roles.</p>
    <p>Se­cu­rity firm Ae­tos Hold­ings, for in­stance, has ob­served that many ap­pli­cants are “ap­pre­hen­sive about try­ing out a uni­formed ca­reer” and oth­ers are un­will­ing to do shift work.</p>
    <p>One lo­gis­tics firm, which de­clined to be named, said it is cau­tious about hir­ing mid-ca­reer work­ers with lit­tle ex­pe­ri­ence in the in­dus­try, as they usu­ally ex­pect the same high pay as be­fore.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong said while the Gov­ern­ment can cre­ate jobs and of­fer sup­port mea­sures, lo­cals must be open and em­brace the chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>“It is bet­ter to be gain­fully em­ployed than to wait for a bet­ter job,” he added. “It is bet­ter to take a job that may pay less than hav­ing no in­come for the fore­see­able fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>FIRMS SHORTLISTI­NG AP­PLI­CANTS WHO ARE EX­ACT MATCH</p>
    <p>Yet, when some lo­cal job seek­ers are will­ing to pick up new skills and make ca­reer switches, they fear that some com­pa­nies might not give them a chance.</p>
    <p>They pointed out that many em­ploy­ers here are still look­ing for can­di­dates with back­grounds that are an ex­act match for their re­quire­ments, es­pe­cially when th­ese firms have re­ceived many ap­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>A 28-year-old, who de­clined to be named, was laid off by a global cos­met­ics firm in Au­gust and has been strug­gling to get a sim­i­lar job in­volv­ing store de­sign and vis­ual mer­chan­dis­ing. De­spite send­ing over 200 ap­pli­ca­tions for po­si­tions such as workspace plan­ner and creative de­signer, the in­dus­trial de­sign grad­u­ate has re­ceived call­backs from only two firms. She reached the third and fi­nal in­ter­view for both firms, but did not get the jobs.</p>
    <p>“The big­gest hur­dle for me is to even prove from the start that I do have the trans­fer­able skill sets across scopes, and the will­ing­ness to learn to make up for all the... knowl­edge gaps,” she said.</p>
    <p>A check on job por­tals has found that many em­ploy­ers spec­ify de­tailed qual­i­fi­ca­tion and ex­pe­ri­ence re­quire­ments in their job ad­ver­tise­ments. One ju­nior ex­ec­u­tive job list­ing for an IT tech­ni­cian at a busi­ness sup­port ser­vices firm has over 20 roles and re­spon­si­bil­i­ties, in­clud­ing go­ing out of the way to of­fer sup­port on its closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion and se­cu­rity sys­tems.</p>
    <p>Some re­cent job post­ings also de­mand fairly high ed­u­ca­tion lev­els for en­try-level jobs or of­fer low salaries for roles with mul­ti­ple func­tions, some job seek­ers ob­served.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, a list­ing for a marine bi­ol­o­gist, which re­quires a master’s or PhD in bi­o­log­i­cal sciences, and more than five years of re­search ex­pe­ri­ence, pays only be­tween $4,000 and $5,000 monthly.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore se­nior eco­nomics lec­turer Kelvin Seah said it is hard to tell com­pa­nies to lower their ex­pec­ta­tions of worker skills be­cause they would “nat­u­rally want to hire up­front those work­ers with the req­ui­site skills, so that the job can be done at the least pos­si­ble cost”.</p>
    <p>“Em­ploy­ers will try not to cast their search too widely, pre­fer­ring to nar­row their search pa­ram­e­ters to tar­get can­di­dates who al­ready pos­sess the skills they are seek­ing, in­stead of try­ing to pick up job seek­ers who do not pos­sess th­ese skills and then hav­ing to spend a lengthy pe­riod of time try­ing to train them,” he ex­plained.</p>
    <p>BE ADAPT­ABLE IN TH­ESE TIMES</p>
    <p>Skills are not a ma­jor con­cern, as they are not dif­fi­cult to learn... Learn to fit to the job to sur­vive... It’s not the time to be choosy. When nor­malcy and bet­ter times re­turn, th­ese work­ers can re-eval­u­ate their op­tions with fu­ture op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
