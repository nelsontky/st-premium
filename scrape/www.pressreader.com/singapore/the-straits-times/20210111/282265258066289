    <p>In the race for a Covid-19 vac­cine, shots that lever­age a new type of tech­nol­ogy – mes­sen­ger RNA (mRNA) – are lead­ing the pack.</p>
    <p>One rea­son for this? The tech­nol­ogy pro­vides a short­cut to the man­u­fac­tur­ing process, us­ing the hu­man body as the “fac­tory”.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, no mRNA vac­cines had been used com­mer­cially.</p>
    <p>But the two lead­ing Covid-19 vac­cines – by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna (right) – now be­ing ad­min­is­tered in var­i­ous coun­tries use this plat­form, and late-stage tri­als have shown that they are more than 90 per cent ef­fec­tive in pre­vent­ing the disease.</p>
    <p>Moderna co-founder Robert Langer, the David H. Koch In­sti­tute pro­fes­sor at the Mas­sachusetts In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy, who will be speak­ing at the Global Young Sci­en­tists Sum­mit (GYSS) this week, had ear­lier said that with tra­di­tional vac­cines, a large fac­tory is needed to make the pro­tein or the virus, and it takes a long time to grow them.</p>
    <p>But with mRNA, the body is the fac­tory.</p>
    <p>“With mes­sen­ger RNA, the body does all the man­u­fac­tur­ing it­self so you can cre­ate a vac­cine much more rapidly, which is crit­i­cal in a pan­demic like we have now,” Pro­fes­sor Langer, 73, told The Straits Times in an e-mail in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>The vir­tual sum­mit, or­gan­ised by Sin­ga­pore’s Na­tional Re­search Foun­da­tion (NRF), will be held from to­mor­row to Fri­day, and will see the world’s top sci­en­tists and tech­nol­o­gists en­gag­ing and in­spir­ing more than 500 young re­searchers from over 30 coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Gen­er­ally, a vac­cine works by “show­ing” the im­mune sys­tem an im­por­tant part of the virus and “train­ing” it to recog­nise and re­mem­ber a pathogen with­out ex­pos­ing the pa­tient to the risk of disease.</p>
    <p>But dif­fer­ent vac­cine tech­nolo­gies go about do­ing this in dif­fer­ent ways.</p>
    <p>Tra­di­tional vac­cines work by in­ject­ing a killed or weak­ened form of the virus into the hu­man body so that the im­mune sys­tem recog­nises the in­vader and be­gins sum­mon­ing its sol­diers – an­ti­bod­ies and T-cells – to get rid of it.</p>
    <p>The mRNA vac­cines like Moderna’s, on the other hand, in­volve in­ject­ing into the pa­tient only frag­ments of the virus’ ge­netic ma­te­rial, in­stead of the whole virus.</p>
    <p>These frag­ments are en­cased in nanopar­ti­cles.</p>
    <p>When these vi­ral ge­netic frag­ments en­ter the hu­man cell after in­jec­tion, they com­man­deer the cell to begin pro­duc­ing the sig­na­ture spike pro­tein of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>This trains the body to recog­nise a key part of the virus – the spike pro­tein – with­out ex­pos­ing it to the whole virus.</p>
    <p>Prof Langer said: “When in­jected into the body, the RNA en­ters cells and the cells make the pro­tein which is the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>“This con­trasts with many pre­vi­ous meth­ods where the pro­tein it­self is used, which of­ten takes a year to man­u­fac­ture.”</p>
    <p>The RNA does not en­ter the nu­cleus where the cell’s genome re­sides, and is de­graded by the cell within a day of the in­jec­tion, noted an ar­ti­cle in the sci­en­tific jour­nal Na­ture last month.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has ap­proved the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine here, and is eval­u­at­ing the avail­able data sub­mit­ted by Moderna.</p>
    <p>Prof Langer said that prior to the pan­demic, Moderna was – and still is – work­ing on a num­ber of pro­jects re­lated to drug de­liv­ery and tis­sue engi­neer­ing.</p>
    <p>He said that de­vel­op­ing a plat­form tech­nol­ogy of­fers re­searchers the op­por­tu­nity to ap­ply it to many problems, some of which may not have been en­vi­sioned at the time.</p>
    <p>Said Prof Langer: “For ex­am­ple, our early work on de­liv­er­ing mol­e­cules from tiny par­ti­cles was aimed at new can­cer treat­ments.</p>
    <p>“But as it turned out, it ended up be­ing use­ful for new treat­ments for di­a­betes, drug ad­dic­tion, schizophre­nia and even Covid-19 vac­cines.”</p>
    <p>He said patents are im­por­tant, es­pe­cially for med­i­cal re­search, be­cause of the enor­mous amount of fund­ing re­quired to carry out clin­i­cal tri­als and man­u­fac­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>At the sum­mit, Prof Langer will speak about his start in sci­ence and early ca­reer struggles, as well as his re­search.</p>
    <p>NRF chief ex­ec­u­tive Low Teck Seng said the GYSS, now in its ninth year, con­tin­ues to in­spire and con­nect young sci­en­tists from around the world.</p>
    <p>“Sci­ence, tech­nol­ogy and in­no­va­tion are key pil­lars of na­tional de­vel­op­ment and im­per­a­tive to the progress of hu­mankind – and GYSS con­tin­ues to sup­port this by bring­ing to­gether gen­er­a­tions of great minds,” said Pro­fes­sor Low.</p>
    <p>• In­for­ma­tion about the Global Young Sci­en­tists Sum­mit is avail­able at www.gyss-one-north.sg. The sum­mit will also be live-streamed on NRF’s YouTube channel (@nrf­me­di­asg) at bit.ly/NRFSGy­outube</p>
