    <p>LONDON • Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son said he ac­cepts the pub­lic is an­gry with his han­dling of the pan­demic, as of­fi­cials con­firmed thou­sands of pos­i­tive cases had been missed from Covid-19 test re­sults.</p>
    <p>Af­ter months of crit­i­cism and amid a slide in the polls, he also warned that the coun­try still faces a “very tough win­ter” ahead.</p>
    <p>“I know peo­ple are fu­ri­ous and they’re fu­ri­ous with me,” he said on the BBC’s An­drew Marr pro­gramme on Sun­day. “It’s go­ing to be bumpy through to Christ­mas, it may even be bumpy be­yond.”</p>
    <p>The pub­lic, he said, should live “fear­lessly but with com­mon sense”. His mes­sage was aimed at try­ing to per­suade the pub­lic of the difficulty of his task to strike a bal­ance be­tween sup­press­ing the virus as new cases rise and keep­ing the econ­omy open.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cally, he is seek­ing to use the Con­ser­va­tive Party’s con­fer­ence – forced on­line this year – to re­assert his authority on a frac­tious party and re­set the agenda for his gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Pub­lic Health Eng­land said 15,841 pos­i­tive test re­sults had been missed from of­fi­cial daily Covid-19 fig­ures be­tween Sept 25 and Oct 2. The er­ror was due to a tech­ni­cal is­sue in the au­to­mated pro­cess­ing of data, the agency said. It took the daily fig­ures an­nounced on Sun­day to over 22,000 cases.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son yes­ter­day sought to play down the fail­ure, say­ing the much higher up­dated fig­ures were more in line with fore­casts of the out­break’s spread. The glitch is likely to cast fur­ther doubt over his han­dling of the pan­demic: his Con­ser­va­tive gov­ern­ment’s re­sponse has been cast by po­lit­i­cal op­po­nents as slow, poorly or­gan­ised and con­fus­ing.</p>
    <p>“The in­ci­dence that we’re see­ing in the cases re­ally sort of cor­re­sponds to pretty much where we thought we were,” Mr John­son told re­porters. “To be frank, I think that the slightly lower num­bers that we’d seen didn’t re­ally re­flect where we thought that the dis­ease was likely to go, so I think these num­bers are re­al­is­tic,” he added.</p>
    <p>Separately Bri­tain’s vac­cine task force chair Kate Bing­ham said vac­ci­nat­ing ev­ery­one in the coun­try for the coro­n­avirus was “not go­ing to hap­pen”.</p>
    <p>“Only those at risk” need to vac­ci­nate, she said in a Fi­nan­cial Times (FT) in­ter­view. “There’s go­ing to be no vac­ci­na­tion of peo­ple un­der 18. It’s an adul­tonly vac­cine, for peo­ple over 50, fo­cus­ing on health work­ers and care home work­ers and the vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>She told the FT vac­ci­nat­ing healthy peo­ple, who are much less likely to have se­vere out­comes from Covid-19, “could cause them some freak harm”.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain has had Europe’s worst death toll from the virus with the to­tal at over 42,300. Ms Bing­ham said the gov­ern­ment was aim­ing to vac­ci­nate about 30 mil­lion peo­ple, out of a pop­u­la­tion of about 67 mil­lion, if a suc­cess­ful vac­cine against Covid-19 was found, the FT said.</p>
