    <p>The amount of plas­tic waste flow­ing into the ocean and killing ma­rine life could triple in the next 20 years, un­less com­pa­nies and gov­ern­ments can dras­ti­cally re­duce plas­tic pro­duc­tion, ac­cord­ing to a new study.</p>
    <p>Sin­gle-use plas­tic con­sump­tion has in­creased dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, says the In­ter­na­tional Solid Waste As­so­ci­a­tion, a non-govern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion. Face masks and la­tex gloves are wash­ing up daily on Asia’s re­mote beaches.</p>
    <p>Land­fills world­wide are piled high with record amounts of take­away food con­tain­ers and on­line de­liv­ery pack­ag­ing.</p>
    <p>The new re­search, car­ried out by sci­en­tists and in­dus­try ex­perts for The Pew Char­i­ta­ble Trusts and Sys­temiq, also of­fers so­lu­tions that could cut the pro­jected vol­ume of plas­tic en­ter­ing the ocean by more than 80 per cent.</p>
    <p>The road map for stem­ming the ru­n­away ocean plas­tic waste cri­sis is among the most de­tailed ever of­fered in a study.</p>
    <p>If no ac­tion is taken, how­ever, the amount of plas­tic go­ing into the sea every year will rise from 11 mil­lion tonnes to 29 mil­lion tonnes, leav­ing a cu­mu­la­tive 600 mil­lion tonnes swill­ing in the ocean by 2040, the equiv­a­lent weight of three mil­lion blue whales, ac­cord­ing to the study pub­lished in the jour­nal Sci­ence.</p>
    <p>“Plas­tic pol­lu­tion is some­thing that af­fects ev­ery­one. It isn’t a ‘your prob­lem and not my prob­lem’. It’s not one coun­try’s prob­lem. It’s ev­ery­one’s prob­lem,” said the study’s co-au­thor Win­nie Lau, a se­nior man­ager at Pew. “It’s go­ing to get worse if we don’t do any­thing.”</p>
    <p>The strat­egy laid out in the re­port in­cludes redi­rect­ing hun­dreds of bil­lions of dol­lars in plas­tic pro­duc­tion in­vest­ment into al­ter­na­tive ma­te­ri­als, re­cy­cling fa­cil­i­ties and waste col­lec­tion ex­pan­sion in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries.</p>
    <p>This would re­quire a U-turn by the en­ergy in­dus­try, which is rapidly build­ing new chem­i­cal plants around the world to boost plas­tic out­put as its tra­di­tional fuel busi­ness is eroded by a rise in cleaner en­ergy sources.</p>
    <p>In 2017, the amount of plas­tic pro­duced an­nu­ally was 348 mil­lion tonnes, and this is ex­pected to dou­ble by 2040, the study es­ti­mates.</p>
    <p>Big plas­tic pro­duc­ers, in­clud­ing ExxonMo­bil, Dow and Chevron Phillips Chem­i­cal, have said they are com­mit­ted to tack­ling plas­tic pol­lu­tion, de­spite in­creas­ing their out­put. The projects they fund fo­cus on clean­ing up waste.</p>
    <p>The pa­per rec­om­mends, how­ever, that gov­ern­ments im­ple­ment laws to dis­cour­age new plas­tic pro­duc­tion and pro­vide sub­si­dies for re­us­able al­ter­na­tives.</p>
    <p>The plas­tic in­dus­try, how­ever, has lob­bied against gov­ern­ment bans on sin­gle-use plas­tic.</p>
    <p>Some of the big­gest buy­ers of plas­tic are con­sumer goods com­pa­nies such as Coca-Cola, Pep­siCo, Nes­tle and Unilever.</p>
