    <p>With the end of his two-year con­tract loom­ing, a Sin­ga­porean tech­ni­cal of­fi­cer who was em­ployed by a con­sul­tancy firm in the con­struc­tion sec­tor was get­ting wor­ried.</p>
    <p>His em­ployer owed him close to $10,000 and was un­re­spon­sive to his queries.</p>
    <p>The man had not re­ceived about $5,000 in over­time pay from De­cem­ber last year to Fe­bru­ary this year, as well as a bonus of about $4,000 for work­ing on a project from start to end.</p>
    <p>The tech­ni­cal of­fi­cer, who gave his name as Mr Ab­dul Rahim, filed a salary claim at the</p>
    <p>Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Dis­pute Man­age­ment (TADM) in March.</p>
    <p>The TADM me­di­a­tor re­viewed his salary claims with both par­ties over the phone and e-mail, avoid­ing face-to-face me­di­a­tion due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
    <p>The em­ployer agreed to pay up, but when Mr Rahim, 54, was about to col­lect the cheque, Malaysia is­sued the move­ment con­trol or­der.</p>
    <p>He was work­ing on a housing project in Malaysia at the time and liv­ing there, so he was un­able to come to Sin­ga­pore to col­lect the cheque.</p>
    <p>The TADM me­di­a­tor con­tacted the em­ployer for an al­ter­na­tive pay­ment ar­range­ment, and the em­ployer agreed to de­posit the cheque on Mr Rahim’s be­half.</p>
    <p>Mr Rahim said that he felt happy to re­ceive the set­tle­ment within a month.</p>
    <p>“The me­di­a­tor was friendly and im­par­tial and lis­tened to both par­ties. He helped me and my em­ployer re­solve the dis­pute am­i­ca­bly,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I even rec­om­mended to my friend that he ap­proach TADM for his salary dis­putes too, in­stead of going to a lawyer.”</p>
