    <p>Ty­coon Oei Hong Leong is su­ing Raf­fles Ed­u­ca­tion Corp over its plan to raise its stake in a Chi­nese prop­erty firm.</p>
    <p>Mr Oei, who owns 13.05 per cent of Raf­fles Ed­u­ca­tion, and his firm Oei Hong Leong Art Mu­seum have com­menced an orig­i­nat­ing sum­mons in the Sin­ga­pore High Court, the ed­u­ca­tion provider said in a fil­ing on Wed­nes­day night.</p>
    <p>The suit seeks to al­low Mr Oei and his firm to in­spect cer­tain doc­u­ments set out in a Raf­fles Ed­u­ca­tion cir­cu­lar dated Sept 8.</p>
    <p>The cir­cu­lar was for the pro­posed ac­qui­si­tion of a 35.9 per cent in­ter­est in a joint ven­ture com­pany, Lang­fang Hezhong Real Es­tate De­vel­op­ment, for about 254 mil­lion yuan (S$49.2 mil­lion) in cash.</p>
    <p>A Raf­fles Ed­u­ca­tion sub­sidiary held a 34.1 per cent in­ter­est in the Chi­nese prop­erty firm as at July 16, while Lang­fang Hey­ing Real Es­tate De­vel­op­ment owned the rest.</p>
    <p>The cir­cu­lar re­ferred to sev­eral doc­u­ments – in­clud­ing the frame­work and share­hold­ers’ agree­ments – that were not made avail­able for in­spec­tion be­fore Wed­nes­day’s ex­tra­or­di­nary gen­eral meet­ing (EGM).</p>
    <p>Raf­fles Ed­u­ca­tion re­sponded to share­hold­ers’ ques­tions on Tues­day about these doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>It noted that a sum­mary of the rel­e­vant terms was al­ready dis­closed in the cir­cu­lar and that their ma­te­rial terms were dis­closed in its pre­vi­ous an­nounce­ments.</p>
    <p>Mr Oei’s sum­mons also de­manded an­swers to cer­tain queries be­fore vot­ing on the res­o­lu­tion for the pro­posed ac­qui­si­tion at any Raf­fles Ed­u­ca­tion meet­ing.</p>
    <p>The plain­tiffs are seek­ing an injunction against the com­pany to stop it hold­ing any share­hold­ers’ meet­ing at which the pro­posed res­o­lu­tion will be voted on.</p>
    <p>It also wants an injunction to stop Raf­fles Ed­u­ca­tion from pro­ceed­ing with any fur­ther acts in re­la­tion to the stake pur­chase.</p>
    <p>Mr Oei had ap­plied for in­terim in­junc­tions in the High Court but these were dis­missed on Wed­nes­day, al­low­ing Raf­fles Ed­u­ca­tion to con­duct its EGM later that day.</p>
    <p>Its share­hold­ers then ap­proved the pro­posed ac­qui­si­tion, with 78.6 per cent vot­ing in favour and 21.4 per cent against.</p>
    <p>Raf­fles Ed­u­ca­tion said on Wed­nes­day night that it will de­fend Mr Oei’s orig­i­nat­ing sum­mons “vig­or­ously”. It added that it was ad­vised that the sum­mons is without merit.</p>
    <p>Mr Oei’s lat­est lit­i­ga­tion comes af­ter he sued Raf­fles Ed­u­ca­tion founder Chew Hua Seng for al­legedly reneg­ing on his prom­ise to get a buyer for Mr Oei’s shares at 44 cents apiece, based on a hand­writ­ten “con­fi­den­tial agree­ment” dated Oct 16, 2017 signed by the two men.</p>
    <p>The High Court dis­missed that law­suit against Mr Chew in Fe­bru­ary. In Au­gust, the Court of Ap­peal dis­missed Mr Oei’s ap­peal against the judg­ment.</p>
    <p>Raf­fles Ed­u­ca­tion shares closed down 3.85 per cent at 12.5 cents yes­ter­day.</p>
