    <p>Warriors FC hope their ab­sence from the Sin­ga­pore Premier League (SPL) will last for only a sea­son. The foot­ball club says it has im­proved its fi­nances and re­struc­tured its debts, and seeks a meet­ing with Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore of­fi­cials to pro­pose a plan to re­join the league next year.</p>
    <p>Nine-time cham­pi­ons Warriors FC, who were in­structed to sit out this Sin­ga­pore Premier League (SPL) sea­son be­cause of ac­cu­mu­lated debts, are seek­ing to re­turn to the league next year.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that the club have writ­ten to the Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (FAS) seek­ing a meet­ing with its ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee, where they hope to present their pro­posal for re­in­state­ment.</p>
    <p>It is un­der­stood the Warriors are claim­ing that they have con­sol­i­dated their fi­nan­cial po­si­tion and re­struc­tured their out­stand­ing debts, and also want to show the FAS how they plan to be fi­nan­cially sus­tain­able.</p>
    <p>The club are also keen to ad­dress the is­sue of their new man­age­ment team.</p>
    <p>For­mer gen­eral man­ager Paul Poh has re­signed – the FAS had asked the Warriors to re­lieve him of his du­ties in Au­gust last year.</p>
    <p>While for­mer chair­man Philip Lam re­mains on the man­age­ment com­mit­tee (MC), it is un­der­stood Bri­gadier-Gen­eral (Ret) Lam Shiu Tong, an ex-chair­man who was an ad­viser to the club, is stand­ing in as act­ing chair.</p>
    <p>Last De­cem­ber, af­ter two months of cor­re­spon­dence, the FAS had in­structed the Warriors to sit out the cur­rent sea­son, cit­ing the club’s debts to var­i­ous au­thor­i­ties and their play­ers’ un­paid salaries, which al­legedly amounted to al­most $850,000, as the rea­son.</p>
    <p>A source told ST that a “sig­nif­i­cant por­tion” of the debts have been re­paid, and that the club have also reached agree­ments with the Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) Board and In­land Rev­enue Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore, as well as sched­uled all re­main­ing salaries owed to play­ers.</p>
    <p>The club used their sur­pluses from their Sin­ga­pore Pools out­let, along with con­tri­bu­tions from MC mem­bers, to pay off this por­tion of the debt.</p>
    <p>The Warriors were orig­i­nally known as the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces Foot­ball Club and acted un­der the purview of the Min­istry of De­fence (Min­def).</p>
    <p>They are the most suc­cess­ful Sin­ga­pore foot­ball club of the pro­fes­sional era, and the only team to com­pete in the Asian Cham­pi­ons League group stage.</p>
    <p>A name change to Warriors FC in 2013 pre­ceded Min­def ced­ing con­trol of the club in Jan­uary 2017 – when Philip Lam took over the reins – re­port­edly to al­low an un­named in­com­ing pri­vate spon­sor more in­flu­ence in the run­ning of the club.</p>
    <p>Barely 18 months later, trou­ble started brew­ing.</p>
    <p>ST re­ported in October 2018 that the club had strug­gled to pay their staff on time, lead­ing to the Min­istry of Man­power bar­ring them from for­eign hires.</p>
    <p>In July last year, with the late salary pay­outs con­tin­u­ing, the FAS said it was “gravely con­cerned” with how fi­nan­cial sub­si­dies pro­vided to the club had been ad­min­is­tered. It also re­vealed it had been pay­ing the club em­ploy­ees’ monthly CPF con­tri­bu­tions di­rectly to the CPF Board since March.</p>
    <p>In Novem­ber last year, the Warriors were charged with 107 counts of not pay­ing their em­ploy­ees’ salaries as far back as July, with ar­rears amount­ing to over $350,000. A month later, the club an­nounced they had paid $150,000 through loans from their MC mem­bers.</p>
