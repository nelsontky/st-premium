CD4 T cells CD8 T cells Help B cells (another type of white blood cells) make antibodies Kill viral infected cells Cell count 900 Cell count 900 Recovered patient Recovered patient 800 800 700 700 600 600 500 500 400 400 Covid-19 patient 300 300 200 200 Covid-19 patient 100 100 0 0 • The graphs above show how T cell counts – both CD4 and CD8 – have increased after patient recovery.
• Severe forms of Covid-19 are associated with lower T cell counts. TIME TAKEN: HOW IT IS DONE:
1
People who have recovered from Covid-19 donate around 350ml to 450ml of blood.
2
Protein fragments from the Covid-19 virus are mixed with the donor ’s cells, to “wake up” and sieve out the T cells already trained to attack Sars-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19.
This takes about four hours. Protein fragments from Covid-19 virus Manufactur­ing, which activates the T cells to fight the Sars-Cov-2 virus, can be done clinically in a day. A separate antibody with iron attached to it is then added into the mixture, which binds to the Covid-19 specific T cells, which can then be removed with a magnet.
4
These T cells are then stored in a cell bank, ready to be infused into patients. • Patients with severe forms of Covid-19.
• Those at risk of developing severe forms of the disease. They include seniors and those with underlying conditions. “Awakened” T cells Donor’s cells 3 WHO MIGHT BENEFIT MOST FROM THIS TREATMENT? Source: KKH PHOTO: ST FILE STRAITS TIMES GRAPHICS THE TREATMENT
