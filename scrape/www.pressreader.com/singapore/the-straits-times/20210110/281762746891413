    <p>View­ers were hor­ri­fied to see a sim­u­la­tion of the amount of brute force needed to rup­ture Jung-in’s pan­creas. Taek­wondo kicks would not be enough, ac­cord­ing to the show. But it could hap­pen if Jung-in’s adop­tive mum were to jump off a sofa and land on her body.</p>
    <p>She was a cheer­ful baby bounc­ing with en­ergy, her chubby cheeks earn­ing her the nick­name “Lit­tle Peach”.</p>
    <p>Although given up at birth for adop­tion, the lit­tle girl named Jung-in blos­somed un­der the lov­ing care of fos­ter par­ents.</p>
    <p>When she was seven months old, a so-called “per­fect fam­ily” came along to adopt her.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple in their 30s were known to be de­vout Chris­tians who wanted a younger sib­ling for their four-year-old daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>The hus­band, sur­named Ahn, worked in a broad­cast­ing com­pany, while the wife, sur­named Jang, was an in­ter­preter who had stud­ied over­seas.</p>
    <p>Both of them had helped Korean adoptees be­fore and they even went on a tele­vi­sion show with both chil­dren, say­ing “adop­tion is not a shame but some­thing to be cel­e­brated”.</p>
    <p>What was sup­posed to be the be­gin­ning of a happy life for Jung-in, how­ever, turned into a night­mare.</p>
    <p>She was just 16 months old when she died on Oct 13 last year, her pan­creas rup­tured and her stom­ach bloated with blood, af­ter months of ex­ten­sive abuse by her adop­tive mother, who has been ar­rested and will go on trial on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The bru­tal­ity of Jung-in’s death caused a na­tional up­roar, with celebri­ties in­clud­ing BTS mem­ber</p>
    <p>Jimin join­ing a #Sor­ryJun­gin cam­paign on social me­dia to mourn and vent against child abuse.</p>
    <p>Ac­tress Han Hye-jin wrote on In­sta­gram that she was so up­set that she could not sleep. “What was done to Jung-in was cruel, vi­cious and hor­rific. How could they do this?” she posted.</p>
    <p>Child abuse has long been a prob­lem in South Korea, where abu­sive par­ents con­sider their chil­dren as their “prop­erty”, and feel they can do any­thing to them,</p>
    <p>in­clud­ing be­ing vi­o­lent and ne­glect­ful. If ques­tioned, they are known to re­tort “this is my way of rais­ing my child”.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cial data showed that there were 41,389 re­ported cases of child abuse in 2019 – up from 29,671 in 2016. Ex­perts be­lieve there could be a lot more un­re­ported in­ci­dents, which are con­sid­ered fam­ily mat­ters and not po­lice cases.</p>
    <p>A ma­jor case seems to emerge ev­ery few years, shock­ing the na­tion and trig­ger­ing protests and de</p>
    <p>mands for stiffer penal­ties for child abuse.</p>
    <p>Two gam­ing ad­dicts were ar­rested in 2010 for ne­glect­ing their three-month-old baby and leav­ing her to starve to death, while they were out play­ing on­line games in In­ter­net cafes.</p>
    <p>A man was found to have beaten his seven-year-old son to death and dis­mem­bered his body for dis­posal. Some parts were flushed down the toi­let, some thrown in the trash, and some still stored in the home</p>
    <p>freezer when the truth came to light three years later in 2015.</p>
    <p>Ac­tivists have lam­basted the govern­ment’s in­abil­ity to pro­tect chil­dren from vi­o­lence de­spite re­peated prom­ises to do so, not­ing that Bills re­lated to child abuse are still lan­guish­ing in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>And now, there is the sad case of Jung-in, which has sparked calls for stricter screening for adop­tion and more proac­tive po­lice re­ac­tion to re­ports of sus­pected abuse.</p>
    <p>It turned out that three sep­a­rate re­ports had been made about Jung-in, in­clud­ing one by a pae­di­a­tri­cian who had ex­am­ined her bruises, but the po­lice did not in­ves­ti­gate fur­ther.</p>
    <p>When a child­care worker first re­ported sus­pected abuse to the po­lice, the par­ents claimed they had prob­a­bly mas­saged the girl too hard, re­sult­ing in bruis­ing.</p>
    <p>It was only af­ter Jung-in’s death that the po­lice found 800 abuse videos on her adop­tive mother’s phone. She will be charged over in­vol­un­tary man­slaugh­ter by child abuse, and her hus­band, child abuse and neg­li­gence.</p>
    <p>Jung-in’s case drew re­newed public at­ten­tion last week, af­ter the case was fea­tured in SBS TV sta­tion’s in­ves­tiga­tive pro­gramme Unan­swered Ques­tions on Jan 2.</p>
    <p>View­ers were hor­ri­fied to see a sim­u­la­tion of the amount of brute force needed to rup­ture Jung-in’s pan­creas. Taek­wondo kicks would not be enough, ac­cord­ing to the show. But it could hap­pen if Jun­gin’s adop­tive mum were to jump off a sofa and land on her body.</p>
    <p>Spec­u­la­tion had also emerged that the fam­ily adopted Jung-in only as a “gift” for their bi­o­log­i­cal daugh­ter, and that they pushed for adop­tion in or­der to get a big­ger hous­ing loan that is of­fered to fam­i­lies with more than one child.</p>
    <p>There are now calls for the mother to be tried for mur­der in­stead. The Korean Women Lawyers As­so­ci­a­tion (KWLA) is­sued a state­ment last Mon­day say­ing that the ev­i­dence gath­ered so far points to mur­der.</p>
    <p>The as­so­ci­a­tion also urged the govern­ment to al­lo­cate more re­sources and man­power to in­ves­ti­gat­ing child abuse cases, not­ing that 28 chil­dren died of abuse at home in 2018 alone.</p>
    <p>South Korean Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in has since or­dered agen­cies to make all ef­forts to bet­ter pro­tect young adoptees, while po­lice chief Kim Chang-yong is­sued an apol­ogy for the po­lice’s “botched ini­tial re­sponse and inad­e­quate in­ves­ti­ga­tion”, and promised to over­haul the way they re­spond to child abuse re­ports.</p>
    <p>But the KWLA said that with­out any sub­stan­tial ac­tion, this will just be an empty prom­ise.</p>
