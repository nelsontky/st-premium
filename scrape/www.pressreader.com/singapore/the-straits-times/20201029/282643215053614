    <p>OF­FI­CIALLY EN­GAGED: Less than a month af­ter Amer­i­can coun­try singer Blake Shelton posted his love for Gwen Stefani on so­cial me­dia on her 51st birth­day, he has popped the all-im­por­tant ques­tion to his girl­friend of five years.</p>
    <p>And her an­swer? “Yes please,” the vo­cal­ist of the band No Doubt wrote on so­cial me­dia. She posted a photo (left) of them kiss­ing and her show­ing off a ring on her fin­ger.</p>
    <p>Shelton, 44, posted the same photo and wrote: “Thanks for sav­ing my 2020... And the rest of my life... I love you. I heard a YES.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Peo­ple mag­a­zine, the cou­ple got en­gaged in Ok­la­homa, where they have been spend­ing time at his ranch amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>On Stefani’s birth­day on Oct 3, Shelton had posted a photo of them from their mu­sic video Happy Any­where, where she is seen cosy­ing up to him in a corn field.</p>
    <p>He wrote: “It’s a spe­cial day for a spe­cial lady in my life. Happy birth­day @gwen­ste­fani, I’d write a song for you ev­ery sin­gle day if I could.”</p>
    <p>The two met as coaches on singing-com­pe­ti­tion show The Voice (2011 to present) and went pub­lic with their re­la­tion­ship in Novem­ber 2015 af­ter ru­mours of them dat­ing sur­faced on­line.</p>
    <p>Shelton was mar­ried to fel­low coun­try singer Mi­randa Lam­bert, 36, from 2011 to 2015, while Stefani was mar­ried to English singer Gavin Ross­dale, 54, for nearly 14 years un­til their di­vorce was fi­nalised in 2016. Stefani and Ross­dale have three sons to­gether.</p>
    <p>At the CMT Mu­sic Awards last Wed­nes­day, Shelton and Stefani won the Col­lab­o­ra­tive Video of the Year accolade for their song No­body But You.</p>
    <p>They are cur­rently ap­pear­ing as coaches in the 19th sea­son of The Voice along­side singers John Leg­end and Kelly Clark­son.</p>
