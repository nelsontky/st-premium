    <p>Here is a hol­i­day quiz ques­tion for you: What do puz­zles, poker and mis­in­for­ma­tion have in com­mon?</p>
    <p>The an­swer is at the bot­tom of this col­umn. Let’s try an eas­ier ques­tion first.</p>
    <p>In Santa’s work­shop, if it takes five elves five min­utes to wrap five presents, how long does it take 50 elves to wrap 50 presents?</p>
    <p>You prob­a­bly know the an­swer to that one; it fol­lows a clas­sic for­mula for a trick ques­tion.</p>
    <p>But as you groped to­wards the cor­rect an­swer, you may have had to fight off your in­stinct to blurt out a tempt­ing wrong an­swer: 50 min­utes.</p>
    <p>The dif­fi­culty with this prob­lem is paus­ing for the brief mo­ment nec­es­sary to carry that arith­metic out, while fend­ing off the ob­vi­ous but in­cor­rect an­swer that pops into your mind un­bid­den.</p>
    <p>An even more fa­mous ex­am­ple is the “bat and ball” ques­tion: If a bat and a ball to­gether cost $1.10, and the bat costs a dol­lar more than the ball, how much does the ball cost?</p>
    <p>Ten cents, screams the in­stinc­tive re­sponse, but it does not re­quire a spread­sheet to work out that that is not right. It just re­quires one to stop and think (or to have heard the ques­tion be­fore).</p>
    <p>And here’s a less fa­mous one: If you flip a coin three times, what is the prob­a­bil­ity of flip­ping at least two heads? A naive re­sponse is that two out of three flips need to come good, and the chance of that is one-third.</p>
    <p>A more so­phis­ti­cated re­sponse recog­nises that three coin flips pro­duce eight pos­si­ble com­bi­na­tions – so per­haps the prob­a­bil­ity is three out of eight?</p>
    <p>Work through those eight com­bi­na­tions, how­ever, and you re­alise the true chance is 50-50.</p>
    <p>Of­ten peo­ple see false claims and share them im­pul­sively, not be­cause they can­not fig­ure out that the claims are false, but be­cause they did not stop long enough to try.</p>
    <p>Ques­tions such as these are called cog­ni­tive re­flec­tion prob­lems.</p>
    <p>They were made fa­mous by psy­chol­o­gist Daniel Kah­ne­man in his book Think­ing, Fast And Slow, but they were de­vel­oped by the be­havioural econ­o­mist Shane Fred­er­ick. They vary in dif­fi­culty, but the ideal cog­ni­tive re­flec­tion prob­lem has an an­swer that is sim­ple, ob­vi­ous and wrong – as well as a cor­rect an­swer that is not too hard to cal­cu­late.</p>
    <p>Be­havioural sci­en­tists Gor­don Pen­ny­cook and David Rand, some­times work­ing with other col­leagues, have pub­lished stud­ies draw­ing the con­nec­tion be­tween cog­ni­tive re­flec­tion prob­lems and on­line mis­in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Of­ten peo­ple see false claims and share them im­pul­sively, not be­cause they can­not fig­ure out that the claims are false, but be­cause they did not stop long enough to try.</p>
    <p>Spot­ting fake news, like re­al­is­ing the ball costs just five cents and the 50 elves wrap 50 presents in just five min­utes, re­quires us to stop and think for a mo­ment. And who has time for that these days?</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Pen­ny­cook and As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Rand have found that peo­ple who score higher on Pro­fes­sor Fred­er­ick’s cog­ni­tive re­flec­tion test also do bet­ter at dis­tin­guish­ing truth from po­lit­i­cally par­ti­san false­hood.</p>
    <p>They also con­ducted a sur­vey which found that most peo­ple were per­fectly able to dis­tin­guish se­ri­ous jour­nal­ism from fake news.</p>
    <p>When they am­pli­fied ab­surd head­lines such as “Over 500 ‘Mi­grant Car­a­van­ers’ Ar­rested With Sui­cide Vests”, they did so not be­cause they wanted to spread mis­in­for­ma­tion, nor be­cause they them­selves were un­able to de­tect lies, but be­cause in a world full of dis­trac­tions, they had not re­ally stopped to think.</p>
    <p>Let’s move from puz­zles to poker. To the unini­ti­ated, poker is a game in­volv­ing three el­e­ments: luck, cal­cu­la­tion and de­cep­tion.</p>
    <p>But pro­fes­sional poker play­ers have told me that a fourth el­e­ment is just as im­por­tant: con­trol­ling your emo­tions or, more of­ten, fail­ing to do so – in the lingo,</p>
    <p>“go­ing on tilt”.</p>
    <p>In her spell­bind­ing foray into pro­fes­sional poker, The Big­gest Bluff, psy­chol­o­gist Maria Kon­nikova de­scribes “tilt” as “let­ting emo­tions – in­ci­den­tal ones that are not ac­tu­ally in­te­gral to your de­ci­sion process – af­fect de­ci­sion-mak­ing.”</p>
    <p>This may mean blind rage, as in the tale of the gam­bler so in­can­des­cent that he rammed a bil­liard ball into his mouth, then re­alised he could not re­move it.</p>
    <p>But as Dr Kon­nikova points out, it may also be a pos­i­tive emo­tion such as tak­ing a lik­ing to a fel­low player, or feel­ing joy at win­ning a hand.</p>
    <p>We can­not es­cape our emo­tions, but clear de­ci­sion-mak­ing re­quires that we no­tice them and take them into ac­count. And just as a poker player can go on tilt, so can any of us as we read the head­lines or scroll through so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>In­deed, we should ex­pect those head­lines to be “tilt­ing”. Head­line writ­ers aim for im­pact, while so­cial me­dia thrives on emo­tional en­gage­ment from joy to fury.</p>
    <p>“The goal,” writes Dr Kon­nikova, “is to learn to iden­tify our emo­tions, an­a­lyse their cause, and if they’re not ac­tu­ally part of our ra­tio­nal de­ci­sion process... dis­miss them as sources of in­for­ma­tion.”</p>
    <p>Good ad­vice for poker play­ers. But good ad­vice for any­one doom-scrolling through Twit­ter or shout­ing at the ra­dio dur­ing the morn­ing news bul­letin.</p>
    <p>My ad­vice is sim­ply to take note of your emo­tional re­ac­tion to each head­line, sound bite or sta­tis­ti­cal claim. Is it joy, rage, tri­umph? Fine.</p>
    <p>But hav­ing no­ticed it, keep think­ing. You may find clar­ity emerges once your emo­tions have been ac­knowl­edged.</p>
    <p>So what do puz­zles, poker and mis­in­for­ma­tion have in com­mon?</p>
    <p>Some puz­zles – and some poker hands – re­quire enor­mous in­tel­lec­tual re­sources to nav­i­gate, and the same is true of cer­tain sub­tle sta­tis­ti­cal fal­la­cies.</p>
    <p>But much of the time we fool our­selves in sim­ple ways and for sim­ple rea­sons. Slow down, calm down, and the bat­tle for truth is al­ready half-won.</p>
