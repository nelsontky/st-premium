    <p>LONDON • Nearly 6 per cent of peo­ple in Eng­land were likely in­fected with Covid-19 dur­ing the peak of the pan­demic, re­searchers study­ing the preva­lence of in­fec­tions said yesterday, mil­lions more peo­ple than have tested pos­i­tive for the disease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 313,798 peo­ple have tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 in Bri­tain, 270,971 of which have been in Eng­land, or just 0.5 per cent of the English pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a study which tested more than 100,000 peo­ple across Eng­land for an­ti­bod­ies to the coro­n­avirus showed that nearly 6 per cent of peo­ple had them, sug­gest­ing that 3.4 mil­lion peo­ple had pre­vi­ously con­tracted Covid-19 by the end of June.</p>
    <p>The re­sults are con­sis­tent with other sur­veys, such as those con­ducted by the Of­fice for Na­tional Statis­tics, which sug­gest higher lev­els of Covid-19 in the com­mu­nity dur­ing the pan­demic than im­plied by daily test­ing statis­tics.</p>
    <p>Health­care and care work­ers were most likely to have been pre­vi­ously in­fected.</p>
    <p>Preva­lence of in­fec­tions ap­peared to be highest in London, where 13 per cent of peo­ple had an­ti­bod­ies, while mi­nor­ity eth­nic groups were two to three times as likely to have had Covid-19 com­pared with white peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son had early on hailed an­ti­body tests as a po­ten­tial game changer in tack­ling the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But while help­ful for pop­u­la­tion stud­ies, sci­en­tists said the mar­gin of er­ror for the tests makes them un­re­li­able for use at the in­di­vid­ual level.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers also cau­tioned that al­though an­ti­body tests were help­ful for run­ning such large-scale stud­ies, they were not a guar­an­tee of fu­ture im­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“There are still many un­knowns with this new virus, in­clud­ing the ex­tent to which the pres­ence of an­ti­bod­ies of­fers pro­tec­tion against fu­ture in­fec­tions,” said Dr Gra­ham Cooke, re­search lead at Im­pe­rial Col­lege London.</p>
    <p>“Us­ing the fin­ger-prick tests suit­able for largescale home test­ing has given us clear­est in­sight yet into the spread of the virus in the coun­try and who has been at great­est risk.”</p>
