    <p>The Progress Sin­ga­pore Party (PSP) has stressed that TraceTo­gether data should be used only for con­tact trac­ing pur­poses.</p>
    <p>In a post on its Face­book page yes­ter­day, party sec­re­tary-gen­eral Tan Cheng Bock said al­low­ing the po­lice to ac­cess and use the TraceTo­gether data is not aligned to the orig­i­nal spirit of the con­tact trac­ing pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Es­tab­lish­ing guide­lines to state that the po­lice can use the data only for se­ri­ous crimes would not help to “ease the mind of peo­ple, nor help to re­build trust”, he said.</p>
    <p>“We need to be sin­gu­lar in pur­pose when it comes to con­tact trac­ing and in our fight against this pan­demic. We fear that the Gov­ern­ment’s lat­est move may re­sult in a loss of con­fi­dence in our sys­tems,” said Dr Tan, weigh­ing in on the con­tro­versy in­volv­ing the na­tional con­tact trac­ing pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Public criticism mounted after Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs Des­mond Tan told Par­lia­ment last Mon­day that TraceTo­gether data could be ac­cessed for crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions un­der the Crim­i­nal Pro­ce­dure Code.</p>
    <p>Some saw this as an about-turn as the Gov­ern­ment had ear­lier as­sured cit­i­zens that the data would be used only for con­tact trac­ing pur­poses.</p>
    <p>The Smart Na­tion and Dig­i­tal Gov­ern­ment Of­fice is­sued a state­ment last Fri­day, ac­knowl­edg­ing that it had erred in “not stat­ing that data from TraceTo­gether is not ex­empt from the Crim­i­nal Pro­ce­dure Code”.</p>
    <p>It said new leg­is­la­tion would be in­tro­duced in the next sit­ting of Par­lia­ment to for­malise as­sur­ances that the use of con­tact trac­ing data will be lim­ited to seven cat­e­gories of se­ri­ous crimes such as rape and mur­der.</p>
    <p>In the PSP post, Dr Tan ques­tioned whether the TraceTo­gether sys­tem is fit to be used for trac­ing “ne­far­i­ous ac­tiv­i­ties”.</p>
    <p>“It is con­ceiv­able that a ter­ror sus­pect could very well forge a dif­fer­ent set of meta­data (i.e. name and NRIC), or the user might even carry sev­eral hand­sets to throw the in­ves­ti­ga­tors off the scent,” he said.</p>
    <p>The TraceTo­gether to­ken and app work by ex­chang­ing short­dis­tance Blue­tooth sig­nals, and Blue­tooth data is erased au­to­mat­i­cally after 25 days.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan asked whether the Gov­ern­ment would store con­tact trac­ing data be­yond this spec­i­fied pe­riod, if 25 days is not suf­fi­cient for po­lice op­er­a­tions like trac­ing ter­ror sus­pects. He also asked if the Gov­ern­ment in­tended to ac­tively mon­i­tor the con­tact trac­ing data of those on the In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity Depart­ment’s watch list.</p>
    <p>He said the PSP is con­cerned that the Gov­ern­ment’s “over­reach­ing pow­ers will dis­cour­age peo­ple from us­ing the TraceTo­gether app or to­ken al­to­gether”.</p>
