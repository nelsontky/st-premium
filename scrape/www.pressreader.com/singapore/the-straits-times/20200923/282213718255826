    <p>A sur­vey of 1,500 em­ploy­ers and work­ers here has found that most em­ploy­ers ex­pect a tal­ent crunch this year, even as em­ploy­ees polled said they ex­pect pay rises when switch­ing jobs that are 10 per­cent­age points higher than av­er­age ex­pec­ta­tions last year.</p>
    <p>Among em­ploy­ers’ top con­cerns are a lack of can­di­dates with the nec­es­sary work ex­pe­ri­ence, skills and knowl­edge (58 per cent), in­creased com­pe­ti­tion from other em­ploy­ers (38 per cent), and a lack of can­di­dates who will fit their cor­po­rate cul­ture (36 per cent).</p>
    <p>One pos­si­ble rea­son be­hind em­ploy­ers’ con­cern in this re­gard could be smaller hir­ing bud­gets, with 44 per cent of them cit­ing this as their big­gest chal­lenge this year. Their next big­gest pri­or­i­ties are build­ing a stronger brand (41 per cent) and build­ing a more ca­pa­ble hu­man re­source or tal­ent ac­qui­si­tion team (32 per cent).</p>
    <p>These were among the find­ings in a re­cent re­port by RGF In­ter­na­tional Re­cruit­ment on hir­ing trends and the im­pact of Covid-19 on busi­nesses, fol­low­ing two sur­veys done from last De­cem­ber to March this year, and in April to May.</p>
    <p>In the light of this, the re­port noted: “With the on­set of Covid-19, some em­ploy­ers may find the tal­ent mar­ket brim­ming with po­ten­tial can­di­dates, espe­cially if key com­peti­tors have had to make sig­nif­i­cant cuts.</p>
    <p>“If this is the case, em­ploy­ers would be wise to jump on these key tal­ent quickly and find the bud­get to hire those with spe­cific, niche skills that can help them en­dure the pan­demic, and thrive be­yond it.”</p>
    <p>From the em­ploy­ees’ per­spec­tive, 64 per cent of pro­fes­sion­als say a salary in­cre­ment would be their top rea­son to change em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>Be­sides base salary, 76 per cent of em­ploy­ees con­sider per­for­mance-based bonuses to be a key com­pen­sa­tion fac­tor.</p>
    <p>The op­por­tu­nity for ca­reer ad­vance­ment (43 per cent) and salary con­sid­er­a­tions (42 per cent) re­main top pri­or­i­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans who are con­sid­er­ing new em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>De­spite the gen­eral eco­nomic malaise, Sin­ga­porean pro­fes­sion­als on av­er­age said they ex­pected their pay to rise this year by 27 per cent when switch­ing jobs, up from last year’s 17 per cent.</p>
    <p>RGF In­ter­na­tional Re­cruit­ment Sin­ga­pore manag­ing di­rec­tor James Miles said that while hir­ing for most roles has slowed dur­ing the pan­demic, the need for niche spe­cial­ists – such as data sci­en­tists, cy­ber se­cu­rity ex­perts and soft­ware de­vel­op­ers – has con­tin­ued to in­crease.</p>
    <p>“Due to the lack of this type of lo­cal spe­cial­ist tal­ent, we have seen salary ex­pec­ta­tions rise based on the in­creased de­mand and lack of sup­ply, thus con­tribut­ing to the over­all in­crease in pay rise ex­pec­ta­tions since last year,” he said.</p>
    <p>The re­port cov­ered 11 Asian markets – Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia, In­done­sia, the Philip­pines, Thai­land, Viet­nam, In­dia, China, Ja­pan, Hong Kong and Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey found that 95 per cent of em­ploy­ers in Sin­ga­pore said they have im­ple­mented flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments, and more than 60 per cent of them plan to con­tinue with these be­yond the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
