    <p>A one-year stint i n Stock­holm where he worked for med­i­cal tech­nol­ogy firm Meloq and was ex­posed to bud­ding en­trepreneur­s in­spired Mr Yap Jun Yi to strike out on his own – a de­ci­sion which he says was made eas­ier with the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The 25-year-old is one of five co­founders of per­sonal fi­nance com­pany Taby Tech­nolo­gies, and the only one work­ing full-time at the start-up. His co-founders, aged 24 to 29, are ei­ther study­ing or have other full-time jobs.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion gave him “more as­sur­ance” to start his own busi­ness, said Mr Yap. “I’m go­ing to give my­self a year, till prob­a­bly the end of next year, to see where this busi­ness is go­ing to take me, and whether I want to con­tinue with it or not,” he said. “I think the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion gave me the as­sur­ance to pur­sue my en­trepreneur­ship pas­sion.”</p>
    <p>Many of his friends are on trainee­ships, and most of his peers would pre­fer the sta­bil­ity and se­cu­rity of a full-time job, in­stead of mak­ing it on their own fresh out of univer­sity. “But when I asked my­self whether I would re­gret not pur­su­ing this op­por­tu­nity five years from now, I think I would,” he said.</p>
    <p>The start-up re­ceived a cap­i­tal grant of $30,000 from Startup SG Founder, said Mr Yap, who grad­u­ated with a me­chan­i­cal en­gi­neer­ing de­gree from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme, which is over­seen by govern­ment agency En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore, helps first-time en­trepreneur­s get their busi­nesses off the ground through cap­i­tal sup­port and men­tor­ship.</p>
    <p>The firm is work­ing on a sav­ings tracker that helps chil­dren keep track of their sav­ings, with dif­fer­ent seg­ments to save for var­i­ous rea­sons, such as a fu­ture trip.</p>
    <p>It in­tends to ex­pand the app so that there is a so­cial as­pect to the sav­ings jour­ney, as well as for par­ents to come on­board so that they can keep track of their chil­dren’s sav­ings. The start-up will also im­ple­ment a re­wards pro­gramme for par­ents to in­cen­tivise the sav­ings process, Mr Yap added.</p>
    <p>The app has had its beta launch and a fuller roll-out is sched­uled for next month.</p>
