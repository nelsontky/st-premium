    <p>BLUES NEED TO TIGHTEN UP AT THE BACK</p>
    <p>Af­ter 21 games, the top flight fi­nally pro­duced its first draw of the sea­son when Chelsea sal­vaged a point at West Bromwich Al­bion.</p>
    <p>The Blues were 3-0 down at half-time on Satur­day but Tammy Abra­ham got their equaliser deep into stop­page time.</p>
    <p>While Frank Lam­pard will be pleased with Chelsea’s at­tack­ing po­tency, there are ques­tions about their sham­bolic de­fence.</p>
    <p>FOX HUNT IS WELL UN­DER WAY ONCE MORE</p>
    <p>On the ev­i­dence of the first few weeks, Chelsea and Manch­ester United re­main far from chal­lengers while Le­ices­ter City could yet launch an­other top­four bid.</p>
    <p>The Foxes pro­duced an­other state­ment vic­tory at Manch­ester City, as they did when they won the ti­tle in the 2015-16 sea­son.</p>
    <p>Bren­dan Rodgers men were pipped to fourth place on the fi­nal day of last sea­son, but have opened the new cam­paign with three wins in as many games.</p>
    <p>‘BAM BAM’ BAMFORD PROV­ING A POINT FOR THE WHITES</p>
    <p>Pa­trick Bamford had man­aged just one goal in 27 ap­pear­ances in the Premier League be­fore this sea­son but the Leeds United striker has an­swered his doubters by scor­ing in all three games so far this cam­paign, in­clud­ing the win­ner in Sun­day’s 1-0 win over Sh­effield United.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the way he has started this sea­son with goals against Liver­pool, Ful­ham and Sun­day’s 88th-minute header, those who felt he might be good enough only for the Cham­pi­onship are hav­ing to eat their words.</p>
