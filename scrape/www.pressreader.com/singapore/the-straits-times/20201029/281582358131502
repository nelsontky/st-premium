    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy is likely to take longer to re­cover from the Covid-19 cri­sis than it did in past re­ces­sions, of­fi­cials said yes­ter­day. Part of the rea­son is a drop in earn­ings for busi­nesses and lower in­comes for house­holds.</p>
    <p>A gym in Jurong West, an ice cream shop in the Up­per Thom­son area and a food­court in Changi Air­port Ter­mi­nal 3 were among the new places vis­ited by in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Of the new places added to a list of lo­ca­tions vis­ited by such pa­tients, the Health Min­istry said that six vis­its were recorded at Any­time Fit­ness gym at Nanyang Com­mu­nity Club in Jurong West.</p>
    <p>The other new places are Our Tampines Hub’s Rumah Makan Mi­nang res­tau­rant, Changi Air­port Ter­mi­nal 3’s Ko­pi­tiam and the Ice Cream Chefs shop in Up­per Thom­son.</p>
    <p>MOH pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited for at l east 30 min­utes and the times that they vis­ited to get peo­ple who were at those places at the same time to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>The min­istry has said that close con­tacts would have been no­ti­fied and there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned, if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>The full list of lo­ca­tions and times can be found on the gov.sg web­site.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore also con­firmed seven new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day. All were im­ported.</p>
    <p>They com­prised one per­ma­nent res­i­dent (PR), one work pass holder and five work per­mit hold­ers.</p>
    <p>The PR is a 70-year-old man who ar­rived from Belgium, while the work pass holder is a 34-year-old man who trav­elled from Switzer­land.</p>
    <p>Four of the work per­mit hold­ers came from Myan­mar and one ar­rived from the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>They had all been placed on stay­home no­tices on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore and were tested while serv­ing their no­tices.</p>
    <p>There were no new cases from work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries and no new Covid-19 clus­ters an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s new Covid-19 cases take Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,987.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has in­creased from two cases two weeks ago to three in the past week, MOH added.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week also in­creased from two to three in the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With seven cases discharged yes­ter­day, 57,875 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 40 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, while 29 are in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. There are no pa­tients in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 28 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>Of the new places added to a list of lo­ca­tions vis­ited by in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients, the Health Min­istry said that six vis­its were recorded at Any­time Fit­ness gym at Nanyang Com­mu­nity Club in Jurong West.</p>
