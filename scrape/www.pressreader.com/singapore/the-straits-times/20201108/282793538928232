    <p>Like pres­i­den­tial elec­tions in the United States of Amer­ica, all the votes must be counted. So there are a lot of points to play (for).</p>
    <p>PEP GUARDI­OLA (left), Man City man­ager, on the chal­lenges ahead.</p>
    <p>IN THE DEEP END</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­body in life, we have to grow in sit­u­a­tions like this and he did that. He was pretty much thrown in cold wa­ter.</p>
    <p>JUR­GEN KLOPP (right), Liver­pool man­ager, on cen­tre-back Joe Gomez step­ping in for in­jured col­leagues.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>LON­DON Pep Guardi­ola has com­pared Manch­ester City’s Pre­mier League chal­lenge with the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in a bid to down­play the im­pact of to­day’s home clash with Liver­pool, point­ing out “all the votes must be counted”.</p>
    <p>City and Liver­pool have been the two dom­i­nant sides in Eng­land for the past three years, with the Reds run­ning away with the league last sea­son after back-to-back ti­tles for Guardi­ola’s men.</p>
    <p>How­ever, with City just six games into their sea­son and ev­ery team i n the top flight hav­ing dropped points in at least two games, Guardi­ola be­lieves he must steer his side into con­tention over the long haul.</p>
    <p>“It’s an im­por­tant game but, like the pres­i­den­tial elec­tions in the United States of Amer­ica, all the votes must be counted,” he said on Fri­day. “So there are a lot of points to play (for).</p>
    <p>“It’s al­ways nice to play against the strong­est teams and last year they were stronger. They are an ex­cep­tional team, they have had the same man­ager for a long time and it is nice to face him all the time to im­prove our level.”</p>
    <p>Jur­gen Klopp’s men have al­ready dropped four points i n seven games, more than they did in their open­ing 27 last sea­son.</p>
    <p>Of more last­ing dam­age to their ti­tle cre­den­tials, they have also lost the tow­er­ing pres­ence of Dutch­man Vir­gil van Dijk.</p>
    <p>The de­fender is ex­pected to miss the sea­son with a cru­ci­ate lig­a­ment in­jury sim­i­lar to Aymeric La­porte’s that de­railed City last term.</p>
    <p>But Guardi­ola be­lieves the Reds showed their strength with a 5-0 thrash­ing of Ata­lanta in the Cham­pi­ons League on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“Liver­pool re­main an in­cred­i­ble, top team be­cause the struc­ture is there, they know ex­actly ev­ery player what they have to do. The re­sult against Ata­lanta, we know how dif­fi­cult it is to beat them away, and they did it,” he said.</p>
    <p>“That’s why Liver­pool re­main a top, top-class team.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, he ex­pects a much tighter ti­tle race this sea­son, with Tot­ten­ham, Chelsea, Ar­se­nal and Le­ices­ter also pos­ing a threat.</p>
    <p>“They (Liver­pool) are the big­gest favourites, but I think what hap­pened with the pan­demic this sea­son is dif­fer­ent so I see other teams re­ally strong,” he added.</p>
    <p>“Le­ices­ter re­main in­cred­i­bly solid, Ar­se­nal make a big step for­ward, Tot­ten­ham – (Jose) Mour­inho got the team like he wants – Chelsea now are so sta­ble, not con­ced­ing goals, a huge squad to ro­tate top play­ers.</p>
    <p>“Manch­ester United are not there in terms of re­sults right now, but I know their qual­ity.</p>
    <p>“I think this sea­son will be a lot of teams be­ing there and the last five to 10 games, it will be im­por­tant to ar­rive with the chance to fight for the ti­tle.”</p>
    <p>Klopp has heaped praise on Joe Gomez after the Eng­land cen­tre­back helped the club nav­i­gate their in­jury cri­sis in de­fence.</p>
    <p>Be­sides van Dijk, Joel Matip and stand-in cen­tre-back Fabinho have also suf­fered in­juries.</p>
    <p>In their ab­sence, Gomez has been a steady­ing in­flu­ence and has helped steer Liver­pool to five straight wins in all com­pe­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>“He’s had so many dif­fer­ent (cen­tre-back) part­ners but he was al­ways the kid in the line pretty much and that changed now com­pletely,” Klopp said.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­body in life, we have to grow in sit­u­a­tions like this and he did that. He was pretty much thrown in cold wa­ter. But I’m re­ally happy with his per­for­mances.”</p>
    <p>Matip re­turned to the squad for the thrash­ing of Ata­lanta and is in con­tention to start to­day.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool, how­ever, will be with­out in­jured mid­fielder Thi­ago Al­can­tara as they look to go eight points clear of City (11).</p>
