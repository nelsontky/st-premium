    <p>Lim Loh (1852-1929)</p>
    <p>Con­struc­tion mag­nate and leader of the Chi­nese com­mu­nity, Lim Loh (“Towkay Lim”) was be­lieved to be one of the rich­est men dur­ing the colo­nial era in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The Taoist Hokkien ty­coon made his for­tune from his con­struc­tion business and, later, his brick­works and bis­cuit fac­to­ries. He had six wives, 19 sons and nine daugh­ters.</p>
    <p>His first 10 sons and two daugh­ters were adopted, while the other re­main­ing 16 were bi­o­log­i­cal chil­dren. His first bi­o­log­i­cal son, Lim Bo Seng, fought with the Sin­ga­pore Re­sis­tance against the Ja­panese. He died of tor­ture at the hands of the en­emy on June 29, 1944, in Batu Ga­jah in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Lee Kim Soo was an in­dus­tri­al­ist who pi­o­neered the match man­u­fac­tur­ing industry with his Elka­yes brand of match sticks.</p>
    <p>He made his for­tune man­u­fac­tur­ing la­tex cups and pot­tery prod­ucts for the rub­ber industry.</p>
    <p>Mr Ray­mond Goh and some vol­un­teers dis­cov­ered his un­con­ven­tional Art Deco-style tomb while clear­ing heavy un­der­growth in Bukit Brown in 2012.</p>
    <p>Leong Ah Soon (1881-1934)</p>
    <p>Leong Ah Soon was a widow with two chil­dren be­fore mar­ry­ing Chua Kim Teng, ma­ter­nal grand­fa­ther of Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
    <p>There are 17 chil­dren in­scribed on her tomb­stone – seven sons and 10 daugh­ters, in­clud­ing Mr Lee’s mother, Chua Jim Neo.</p>
    <p>Leong’s tomb bears an enig­matic cou­plet: “When you know the plea­sures of the hills, don’t bother about fame and for­tune.”</p>
    <p>Some of her daugh­ters be­came renowned cooks, in­clud­ing</p>
    <p>Mrs Leong Yee Soo and Chua Jim Neo (Mrs Lee’s Cook­book).</p>
    <p>Oh Sian Guan (1874-1943)</p>
    <p>Oh Sian Guan, whose an­ces­tral place was Fu­jian, Tong Ann, was one of the founders of Oversea-Chi­nese Bank­ing Cor­po­ra­tion, the coun­try’s old­est bank.</p>
    <p>He is also the great-grand­fa­ther of Crazy Rich Asians au­thor Kevin Kwan. The tomb­stone carv­ings are among the more beau­ti­ful ones in Bukit Brown, fea­tur­ing sto­ries from The Ro­mance Of The Three King­doms, such as Gen­eral Guan Yu’s heroic ex­ploits.</p>
    <p>An­cient Qing Dy­nasty tomb (1833/34)</p>
    <p>Mr Ray­mond Goh points at an in­scrip­tion on a tomb, which shows the 13th year of the reign of Em­peror Daoguang (1833/34) at the tomb of Fang Shan, one of the many re-in­terred tombs at Bukit Brown ceme­tery.</p>
    <p>The head­stone was re­made in 1941 by the Fang clan in hon­our of their pi­o­neer with the same sur­name.</p>
    <p>Tan Chor Nam (1884-1971)</p>
    <p>Tan Chor Nam was a pas­sion­ate ad­vo­cate of education for women and pi­o­neer of the 1911 Chi­nese Rev­o­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>In 1917, he founded the Nanyang Girls’ School with rub­ber ty­coon Teo Eng Hock and oth­ers, and was on the school’s board of di­rec­tors for sev­eral years.</p>
    <p>Af­ter World War II, he re­tired and chose to fo­cus mainly on his fam­ily till he died on Sept 22, 1971 at the age of 87.</p>
    <p>Luah Kim Kway (1878-1951)</p>
    <p>Or­phaned from young, Luah Kim Kway came to Sin­ga­pore at 19 and worked his way up from a coolie to be­come a re­spected com­mu­nity leader and busi­ness­man.</p>
    <p>He was also head of a group of “coolie kengs” (quar­ters), which pro­vided shel­ter and sup­port for coolies shar­ing a com­mon ori­gin.</p>
    <p>Most of th­ese coolies were housed in Bali Lane.</p>
    <p>There are about 30 pairs of th­ese spe­cial guardians found in the tombs of Bukit Brown.</p>
    <p>Mod­elled af­ter Sikh sol­diers and po­lice­men who worked in the Straits Set­tle­ments, they can be found mainly in the houses and tombs of Sin­ga­pore, Pe­nang and some other ar­eas, tes­ti­fy­ing to the unique Nanyang tomb ar­chi­tec­ture found in Bukit Brown.</p>
