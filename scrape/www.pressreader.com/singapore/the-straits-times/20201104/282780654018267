    <p>For many of us, our mo­ti­va­tion for ex­er­cis­ing is to lose weight or</p>
    <p>con­sume fewer calo­ries than you ex­pend.</p>
    <p>Here are some sim­ple tips to in­cor­po­rate healthy food in your diet:</p>
    <p>Make it easy</p>
    <p>Cook some­thing that does not take up too much time so that you don’t have to do so much prep work.</p>
    <p>Overnight oats are one such healthy meal that you can pre­pare in ad­vance. Sim­ply toss in some berries in a jar (you don’t even have to chop them!), nuts, seeds and of course, oats,</p>
    <p>Cut out sugar</p>
    <p>Sugar is one of the main fac­tors for putting on weight and con­sum­ing too much may also lead to di­a­betes. Start with small steps to re­duce your sugar in­take. If you are the sort that</p>
    <p>al­ter­na­tives such as ste­via, honey or mo­lasses. How­ever, these are still forms of sugar and you should try to grad­u­ally cut them out com­pletely.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery bit counts</p>
    <p>In­tro­duce healthy foods such as av­o­ca­dos, which are heart healthy. Smooth­ies, which are sim­ple to make, are con­ve­nient and nu­tri­tious too, as you can just blend ev­ery­thing to­gether. In­clude veg­eta­bles too. Blend kale or spinach into smooth­ies and add sweet fruits such as ba­nanas or dates to mask the taste.</p>
    <p>The more the mer­rier</p>
    <p>Di­et­ing alone can be tough es­pe­cially when you are faced with temp­ta­tion ev­ery sin­gle day, such as when you see what your col­leagues eat at lunch or even scrolling down your Instagram feed.</p>
    <p>Get your friends to diet with you for a month, en­cour­age each other and make sure that ev­ery­one sticks to the diet plan.</p>
