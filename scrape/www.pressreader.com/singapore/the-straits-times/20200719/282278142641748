    <p>At the start of this year, vet­eran ac­tress Xiang Yun was think­ing of quit­ting af­ter more than 30 years in show busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The pop­u­lar Me­di­a­corp artist was down­cast about her weight gain and deal­ing with hot flushes and other signs of menopause.</p>
    <p>Sweat some­times soaked the back of her clothes and there were episodes where she drooled ex­ces­sively, she re­counts.</p>
    <p>“Go­ing through menopause these few years has been scary. I felt my body was swollen and my face be­came square in shape. I was very up­set. I was 59.1kg and I thought, this is unac­cept­able.</p>
    <p>“At the be­gin­ning of the year, I felt no hope. I was think­ing of re­sign­ing,” she con­fides.</p>
    <p>Like her hus­band Ed­mund Chen Zhi­cai, a fel­low en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try vet­eran, she is 59 this year.</p>
    <p>They have two chil­dren, Chen Yixi, 29, and Chen Yixin, 20, who are also ac­tors.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary, af­ter Chi­nese New Year, Xiang Yun em­barked on a Tai­wanese diet pro­gramme, which she de­clines to name, which was rec­om­mended by a friend.</p>
    <p>The cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, which started on April 7 and saw film­ing grind to a halt, kick-started a health and fit­ness drive for the en­tire fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Daugh­ter Yixin says: “I think it’s the but­ter­fly ef­fect. I would think: ‘My brother’s ex­er­cis­ing, I’d bet­ter ex­er­cise, too.’ We would in­spire and en­cour­age one an­other.”</p>
    <p>For the first three days of Xiang Yun’s diet, she ate egg whites and cu­cum­bers. Al­though it was hard ini­tially – she dreamt about food – she went on to cut out su­gar and pork.</p>
    <p>Stand­ing at 1.58m tall, she had hoped to lose 3kg. To date, she has lost 9.9kg.</p>
    <p>Though she takes a lit­tle su­gar now and has the oc­ca­sional cheat meal, she is thrilled about her weight loss and wants to “work harder” to bring down her vis­ceral fat lev­els from 10 per cent to 6 per cent.</p>
    <p>She has also been in­spired to im­prove other aspects of her health. She now takes a glass of wine, in­stead of two, on spe­cial oc­ca­sions and tries to sleep early.</p>
    <p>“I got rid of all my bad habits. Health is the most i mpor­tant thing,” says Xiang Yun, who cur­rently hosts va­ri­ety show Sil­ver Car­ni­val on Me­di­a­corp Chan­nel 8.</p>
    <p>She will next play a cleaner in year-end drama se­rial Jun­gle Sur­vivor.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, she some­times j oined Yixin’s daily, hour-long high-in­ten­sity in­ter­val train­ing sessions on Skype with her friends.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, son Yixi per­suaded his fa­ther to gain more mus­cle tone by join­ing him in strength-train­ing ex­er­cises at home.</p>
    <p>These helped Yixi to re­cover from an old sports in­jury that had left him un­able to walk for al­most a week last year.</p>
    <p>Yixi ob­serves: “Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, we as a fam­ily be­came more dis­ci­plined.”</p>
    <p>By ex­er­cis­ing to­gether, they also be­came closer, al­though he says his fa­ther’s more chis­elled body has been a source of tor­ment for him.</p>
    <p>Yixi says with mock de­spair: “I still have no abs. Peo­ple my age will tell me: ‘ Eh, your fa­ther is very hot.’”</p>
    <p>His fa­ther dead­pans: “I com­fort him that it’s be­cause he has baby fat.”</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing the greater team­work and bond­ing within the fam­ily dur­ing the pan­demic, Ed­mund says: “It was a chal­leng­ing pe­riod, but we got closer and re­spected one an­other in the con­fined space.</p>
    <p>“At home, I have three di­rec­tors. Yixin is the F&B di­rec­tor be­cause she cooks a lot.</p>
    <p>“My son is the op­er­a­tional and life­style di­rec­tor be­cause he pushes me to ex­er­cise ev­ery day, even though lazi­ness is part of my DNA. Xiang Yun is the sleep­ing part­ner.”</p>
    <p>He is “talk­ing non­sense”, his wife quips.</p>
    <p>Ed­mund re­calls how he used to be able to “bao” (Man­darin for carry) his beau­ti­ful bride af­ter they mar­ried in 1989, then had to “tuo” (pull) her along in the in­ter­ven­ing years.</p>
    <p>Now that she has lost weight, he can “bao” her again.</p>
    <p>Yixi chimes in: “This is what I have to go through, this com­edy skit, ev­ery day.”</p>
