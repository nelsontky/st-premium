    <p>Since early this month, more pop­u­lar beach­fronts at East Coast Park have been seg­mented by the Na­tional Parks Board (NParks) to con­trol crowds. NParks also tem­po­rar­ily closes sec­tions when they get too crowded.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post on Tues­day, Min­is­ter for the En­vi­ron­ment and Wa­ter Re­sources Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli said the au­thor­i­ties will be step­ping up en­force­ment ef­forts to en­sure that peo­ple con­tinue to com­ply with re­stric­tions un­der phase two of the econ­omy’s re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>This comes on the back of mul­ti­ple in­stances where peo­ple were found to be vi­o­lat­ing rules, said Mr Masa­gos.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the beaches at East Coast Park and Sen­tosa were “ex­tremely crowded” at the week­end, he noted.</p>
    <p>Safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors and en­force­ment of­fi­cers en­coun­tered many groups of more than 10 peo­ple, in­clud­ing ex­tended fam­i­lies and friends con­gre­gat­ing, with a good num­ber who did not wear masks de­spite be­ing re­minded to, say­ing that they were eat­ing or drink­ing.</p>
    <p>“I have been con­cerned that some com­pla­cency may be set­ting in, at a time when we must keep our guard up... Ex­tended ex­po­sure to one an­other without masks and in packed crowds places those in­volved and oth­ers around them at greater risk of con­tract­ing the Covid-19 virus,” Mr Masa­gos wrote.</p>
    <p>Breaches will be taken se­ri­ously, he said.</p>
    <p>This week, 18 peo­ple will be charged in court for gath­er­ing at a place of res­i­dence for so­cial rea­sons dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, while an­other group of 10 were charged yesterday for hold­ing a so­cial gath­er­ing at a fit­ness cor­ner dur­ing phase two of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese ac­tions are not ac­cept­able and a clear vi­o­la­tion of the safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures. We take such breaches se­ri­ously be­cause they can po­ten­tially lead to the for­ma­tion of large clus­ters,” Mr Masa­gos said, urg­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans to con­tinue to re­main so­cially re­spon­si­ble.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, they should wear a mask at all times ex­cept when eat­ing, drink­ing or ex­er­cis­ing, and should keep within a group of no more than five. They should also not mix with other groups at parks, beaches and other pub­lic spa­ces, he added.</p>
    <p>“We are still in the midst of a long battle with the Covid-19 pan­demic. We must be mind­ful and con­tinue be­ing vig­i­lant. This is crit­i­cal, for us to pro­tect one an­other.”</p>
