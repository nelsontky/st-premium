    <p>Once a de­part­ment head at a con­sumer elec­tron­ics com­pany, Ms Joyce Chung found her­self re­trenched a week af­ter her 43rd birth­day.</p>
    <p>But with de­ter­mi­na­tion and sup­port from her hus­band, she has now found a new call­ing as a home baker, whose cin­na­mon rolls have a month-long wait list.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary last year, the Sin­ga­porean was work­ing in Hong Kong as head of mar­ket­ing for Asi­a­Pa­cific at con­sumer elec­tron­ics firm Belkin, when she was let go af­ter her com­pany was ac­quired.</p>
    <p>She says: “I un­der­stood the de­ci­sion. But for a few months, I felt bruised, won­der­ing why it hap­pened to me and if I was some­how not good enough. Even­tu­ally, I got over it and moved on.”</p>
    <p>In June last year, she re­turned to Sin­ga­pore, to­gether with her hus­band, Mr Luigi La Tona, and their two young daugh­ters, to start anew.</p>
    <p>To get her life back on track, she had an am­bi­tious three-pronged strat­egy: she would search for a job, and start a dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing con­sul­tancy as well as a home bak­ing busi­ness out of her rented Ma­rine Pa­rade con­do­minium all at the same time.</p>
    <p>She says: “I fig­ured it was best to try many ap­proaches. They were all re­lated to my pas­sions, so I gave it my all and planned to go where the tide took me.”</p>
    <p>She did not worry overtly about fi­nances, as she had re­ceived a re­trench­ment pack­age of about three months, and had stashed away a six-month emer­gency fund.</p>
    <p>“As a 40some­thing, I know I have to be re­spon­si­ble and have al­ways been pru­dent with money. So I was never wor­ried about not be­ing able to pay the bills.”</p>
    <p>None­the­less, dur­ing her j ob search, there were dis­ap­point­ments such as re­cruiters not call­ing her back, get­ting to the fi­nal in­ter­view, then not l and­ing the job</p>
    <p>sev­eral times.</p>
    <p>Wher­ever she could, she tapped her Skill­sFu­ture cred­its to up­grade her­self through cour­ses such as dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing. Of her en­deav­ours, her home busi­ness emerged the most suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>Last Septem­ber, she re­vived a food brand, Guilt Free Food, which she had started in 2016 to sell snack boxes. This time though, she repo­si­tioned it to sell re­duced-sugar cin­na­mon rolls and gluten-free brown­ies as well as cho­co­late chip and al­mond cook­ies.</p>
    <p>“My hus­band l oves cin­na­mon rolls and he chal­lenged me to make some good ones for him. When my friends started ask­ing me to make rolls for them too, I thought it would be fun to try this out as a busi­ness.”</p>
    <p>Ini­tially, she av­er­aged only a few or­ders a month. Lit­tle did she ex­pect that dur­ing t he cir­cuit breaker in April and May, or­ders poured in ten­fold.</p>
    <p>“Around Easter, de­mand sud­denly ex­ploded. I had two bak­ing pans and im­me­di­ately went to (bak­ing ingredient­s sup­plier) Phoon Huat to buy more. I now have more than 30 pans.”</p>
    <p>She also in­tro­duced new flavours such as Hi­malayan salted caramel, triple cho­co­late and cream cheese frost­ing. Her baked goods are priced from $20 for a 7-inch serv­ing of glaze-ic­ing cin­na­mon rolls to $41 for a 10-inch serv­ing of triple cho­co­late cin­na­mon rolls.</p>
    <p>Even af­ter the cir­cuit breaker, de­mand con­tin­ued to soar, and she is now booked solid for the next month.</p>
    <p>While she does not make as much money as she did in her cor­po­rate job, she finds mean­ing in her new call­ing.</p>
    <p>“I love bak­ing and mak­ing food peo­ple can bond over. I also think my re­duced-sugar desserts are health­ier and – hence my brand – guilt-free. More­over, work­ing from home now al­lows me to spend more time with my fam­ily.”</p>
    <p>Her daugh­ters are now two and four.</p>
    <p>Ms Chung has since stopped look­ing for an­other job. The past year has been a long hard slog, she ac­knowl­edges.</p>
    <p>“When I was still find­ing my way, I was j ug­gling three things and work­ing around the clock.”</p>
    <p>Her hus­band, who is 43 and the chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer at self­s­tor­age op­er­a­tor StorHub Self Stor­age, says: “I know Joyce is very driven and sin­gle-minded, both now and dur­ing her cor­po­rate days. Af­ter she was re­trenched, I think she re­ally cre­ated many of her own op­por­tu­ni­ties.”</p>
    <p>He says he was con­cerned that she might be burn­ing the can­dle at both ends, but adds: “I was also very care­ful about not de­stroy­ing her pas­sion. I would bite my tongue and make her a nice cup of cof­fee in­stead.”</p>
    <p>At times, Mr La Tona, who is Ital­ian-Cana­dian, vol­un­teered to take the kids out of the house when she was busy with or­ders and helped her make de­liv­er­ies.</p>
    <p>Once, he even cy­cled from their Ma­rine Pa­rade home all the way to Cle­menti to de­liver the baked goods.</p>
    <p>“As a hus­band, I want to sup­port her as much as I can. And I am glad that she has found some­thing which she loves and finds mean­ing in.”</p>
