    <p>There is much room for dig­i­talonly banks to grow in South-east Asia, with Sin­ga­pore be­ing a first­mover in dig­i­tal bank­ing li­cens­ing, said a re­port out yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The re­port, re­leased by the Sin­ga­pore Fin­tech As­so­ci­a­tion (SFA), Bos­ton Con­sult­ing Group and Fi­nas­tra, was un­veiled at the first dig­i­tal bank­ing sym­po­sium here, which is be­ing held on­line for two days and ends to­day. It fo­cuses on what it calls dig­i­tal chal­lenger banks – providers of bank­ing ser­vices that are dig­i­tal-only and not backed by in­cum­bents.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of such banks world­wide has grown over the l ast decade to over 200, at­tract­ing around US$15 bil­lion (S$20.4 bil­lion) in fund­ing. About a fifth of these are based in the Asia-Pa­cific, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>South-east Asia might have rel­a­tively few of these banks to­day, but that is poised to change, it added, not­ing that five li­cences will be awarded by the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) this year.</p>
    <p>Telco Sing­tel and ride-hail­ing firm Grab are among a range of firms which have joined in 21 ap­pli­ca­tions for the li­cences, 14 of which have been short­listed.</p>
    <p>“Up­com­ing dig­i­tal chal­lenger banks in Sin­ga­pore have a tremen­dous op­por­tu­nity across the broader SEA (South-east Asian) re­gion, which is set for strong eco­nomic and de­mo­graphic growth in the com­ing decade,” it said.</p>
    <p>It noted that by 2030, the gross do­mes­tic prod­uct of Asean-5 – In­done­sia, Malaysia, the Philip­pines, Sin­ga­pore and Thai­land – is pro­jected to reach US$4.3 tril­lion. This will make it the world’s sixth­largest eco­nomic bloc. Its 540 mil­lion peo­ple put it as a col­lec­tive mar­ket be­hind only China, In­dia and the Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>This large pop­u­la­tion, of which a sig­nif­i­cant por­tion still does not have ac­cess to bank­ing ser­vices, pro­vides op­por­tu­ni­ties, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>“SEA has seen some of the steep­est im­prove­ments in bank ac­count pen­e­tra­tion and us­age... Nonethe­less, there re­mains a signi?cant un­der­banked and un­banked pop­u­la­tion, es­pe­cially in de­vel­op­ing mar­kets,” it added.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, more than 50 per cent of In­done­sians cur­rently do not have a bank ac­count, in a pop­u­la­tion of 270 mil­lion peo­ple. Like­wise, ap­prox­i­mately 68 per cent of adults in Viet­nam and 65 per cent in the Philip­pines are un­banked.”</p>
    <p>There are more than 1,600 fin­tech firms op­er­at­ing in the re­gion, which at­tracted US$5 bil­lion in eq­uity fund­ing to date.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is recog­nised as the re­gional fin­tech hub, the re­port noted, as it at­tracts the ma­jor­ity of re­gional eq­uity fund­ing and is where al­most half of the re­gion’s fin­tech com­pa­nies are head­quar­tered.</p>
    <p>“Fin­techs in Sin­ga­pore are very di­verse: the city-state has a va­ri­ety of fin­techs op­er­at­ing across the in­sur­ance, re­tail ac­counts and trad­ing and in­vest­ments clus­ters, while other South-east Asian coun­tries have a higher con­cen­tra­tion of fin­techs in pay­ments and lend­ing.”</p>
    <p>MAS chief fin­tech of­fi­cer Sop­nendu Mo­hanty said: “With the ad­vent of dig­i­tal banks glob­ally in re­cent years, the fu­ture of fi­nance has been paved. The dig­i­tal banks will re­sult in the cre­ation of jobs and new roles; and lead to new de­mand and developmen­t for tal­ent and skill sets.</p>
    <p>“With the up­com­ing dig­i­tal bank li­cences, we hope to fur­ther so­lid­ify Sin­ga­pore’s po­si­tion as a hot­bed for tal­ent and ex­per­tise both in the re­gion and glob­ally.”</p>
