    <p>It’s al­most time to bid goodbye and good riddance to 2020.</p>
    <p>If you are feel­ing un­moored this De­cem­ber, or just burned out from the past year, these pod­casts will help you feel con­nected.</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>BEAU­TI­FUL STO­RIES FROM ANONY­MOUS PEO­PLE</p>
    <p>The premise of Chris Gethard’s in­no­va­tive in­ter­view show is de­cep­tively sim­ple, rooted in the co­me­dian’s many years in talk ra­dio.</p>
    <p>Each week, he has a phone con­ver­sa­tion with one anony­mous caller, with whom he will speak for an hour about any subject the per­son chooses.</p>
    <p>When the show be­gan in 2016, Gethard fig­ured the end re­sult would be a mostly comedic se­ries of prank calls; in­stead, it has been a re­mark­ably in­ti­mate se­ries of con­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>Some calls do of­fer fun slice-oflife mus­ings, but oth­ers are brac­ingly in­tense – a re­cent caller re­vealed she had barely slept all week after dis­cov­er­ing that a close friend had mur­dered some­one.</p>
    <p>Em­pa­thetic and thrillingl­y unpredicta­ble, Beau­ti­ful Sto­ries makes or­di­nary life as cap­ti­vat­ing as any scripted drama.</p>
    <p>Starter episode: Love In The Time Of Coro­n­avirus</p>
    <p>2 THIS IS LOVE</p>
    <p>After four years of telling en­gross­ing, dis­turb­ing sto­ries about the worst of hu­man­ity in the hyp­notic true crime pod­cast Crim­i­nal, Phoebe Judge and her col­leagues in 2018 be­gan ap­ply­ing the same rigour and nu­ance to telling sto­ries about love.</p>
    <p>As warm as Crim­i­nal is chilly, the off­shoot pod­cast, aptly called This Is Love, ex­plores its cen­tral con­cept through wide-rang­ing nar­ra­tives that are some­times about ro­mance, but some­times about sub­tler kinds of love.</p>
    <p>One episode de­tails the bond be­tween a blind man and his guide dog; another, the ex­tra­or­di­nary saga of two wolves at Yel­low­stone; another, the story of a dive team ven­tur­ing in­side an ice­berg.</p>
    <p>Other episodes ex­plore acts of col­lec­tive love, like the Ital­ian city that vol­un­tar­ily fell silent to pre­serve the sound of a trea­sured vi­o­lin. A sooth­ing and in­spir­ing coun­ter­weight to doom­scrolling. Starter episode: Roselle And Michael</p>
    <p>3 GRIEFCAST</p>
    <p>For any­one grap­pling with loss, Griefcast is a cathar­tic lis­ten.</p>
    <p>The host, Cariad Lloyd, lost her fa­ther to pan­cre­atic can­cer at 15 and for many years was un­able to ex­press the ef­fect it had on her. That ex­pe­ri­ence in­spired her to cre­ate a show that is all about speak­ing the un­speak­able.</p>
    <p>Lloyd sits down with fel­low co­me­di­ans and per­form­ers to “talk, share and laugh about the weird­ness of grief and death”.</p>
    <p>Blend­ing gal­lows hu­mour and sear­ing com­pas­sion, the show cuts through the iso­lat­ing haze that of­ten makes grief un­bear­able. Starter episode: Ais­ling Bea</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>STUFF YOU SHOULD KNOW</p>
    <p>There is no short­age of “ex­plainer” pod­casts that play like a kind of au­dio en­cy­clopae­dia, de­liv­er­ing 101 summaries on a va­ri­ety of top­ics. But the ap­peal of Stuff You Should Know, one of many shows from the pro­lific HowStuffWo­rks brand, lies mainly in the ami­able and gen­uine rap­port be­tween co­hosts Josh Clark and Chuck Bryant.</p>
    <p>Each week, the duo delve into the in­ner work­ings of sub­jects as var­ied as sneez­ing, black cow­boys and the Bay of Pigs dis­as­ter, pep­per­ing their cu­ri­ous con­ver­sa­tions with pop cul­ture ref­er­ences, life anec­dotes and the odd dad joke.</p>
    <p>Even in episodes that ex­plore un­solved mys­ter­ies like the dis­ap­pear­ance of Malaysia Air­lines Flight 370, the tone is al­ways lev­el­headed. A down-to-earth treat that will also teach you some­thing. Starter episode: The Dis­ap­pear­ance Of Flight MH370</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>COMEDY BANG BANG: THE POD­CAST</p>
    <p>Laugh­ter is a sci­en­tif­i­cally backed an­ti­dote to stress and anx­i­ety, and lis­ten­ing to this long-run­ning pod­cast can be a help­ful cop­ing mech­a­nism.</p>
    <p>Having started life as a ra­dio show in 2009, Comedy Bang Bang has evolved into a pod­cast­ing in­sti­tu­tion whose ap­peal is rooted in its unpredicta­ble for­mat.</p>
    <p>Each week, Scott Auk­er­man wel­comes co­me­di­ans and celebri­ties for what are os­ten­si­bly in­ter­views, but quickly de­scend into a sur­real blend of char­ac­ter skits and im­prov seg­ments.</p>
    <p>Starter episode:</p>
    <p>Cy­borg</p>
    <p>Small Claims</p>
    <p>6</p>
    <p>THIS AMER­I­CAN LIFE</p>
    <p>This beloved ti­tan of au­dio jour­nal­ism cel­e­brated its 25th an­niver­sary this year and marked the oc­ca­sion by re­broad­cast­ing some of its most mem­o­rable episodes.</p>
    <p>The re­runs were a re­minder of just how time­less the show is, il­lu­mi­nat­ing dif­fer­ent nooks and cran­nies of the Amer­i­can ex­pe­ri­ence and draw­ing un­ex­pected lines be­tween them.</p>
    <p>An­chored by Ira Glass’ inim­itable wry, halt­ing voice, each episode – usu­ally a pro­logue and three acts – in­tro­duces a cen­tral theme that is ex­plored through dif­fer­ent types of non-fic­tion sto­ry­telling, in­clud­ing re­portage, mono­logue and verse.</p>
    <p>This Amer­i­can Life (which now has a “cre­ative and strate­gic” re­la­tion­ship with The New York Times) is not a news show, but it ex­cels at tak­ing a timely story and boil­ing it down to an es­sen­tial theme.</p>
    <p>Starter episode: 129 Cars</p>
    <p>7</p>
    <p>KIND WORLD</p>
    <p>It is no se­cret that bad news trav­els faster (and fur­ther) than good news, and as its ti­tle sug­gests, this show from Bos­ton-based WBUR is all about re­dress­ing the bal­ance.</p>
    <p>Each episode of Kind World fo­cuses on an in­stance of hu­man de­cency – an act of char­ity, a chance en­counter that sparks a con­nec­tion, some­body go­ing above and be­yond for their com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>As lock­downs de­scended in the spring, the show ran a se­ries of bite-size episodes ti­tled A Mo­ment Of Kind­ness, in which lis­ten­ers called in to share their own mem­o­ries of ev­ery­day em­pa­thy.</p>
    <p>The pod­cast wrapped up in the sum­mer, but the back cat­a­logue has enough life-af­firm­ing gems to keep your faith in hu­man­ity strong for months.</p>
    <p>Starter episode: Glim­mers Of Light Amid Dark­ness</p>
