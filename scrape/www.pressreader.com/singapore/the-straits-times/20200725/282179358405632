    <p>Over the last 40 years, the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency ap­pears to have been us­ing the same strat­egy to erad­i­cate dengue fever – try­ing to ex­ter­mi­nate mos­qui­toes. This clearly has not been suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>Once, when my mother was hos­pi­talised, she was in a non-air-con­di­tioned hos­pi­tal ward and ly­ing in the bed next to hers was a woman be­ing treated for dengue.</p>
    <p>I was aghast, as all it would take was one mos­quito bit­ing this woman and oth­ers in the ward could end up be­ing in­fected as well.</p>
    <p>When a friend was warded in a pri­vate hos­pi­tal with dengue, he was bit­ten by a mos­quito even though he was in an air-con­di­tioned, sin­gle room.</p>
    <p>The hos­pi­tal staff were ex­tremely wor­ried that other pa­tients, or even the staff them­selves, would get the dis­ease as well.</p>
    <p>It was sim­i­lar to the con­cern I had when my flat­mate came down with dengue. I de­cided to take no chances. I made sure every win­dow in our apart­ment was shut to pre­vent any mos­quito get­ting to him, as our neigh­bours or I could have been the next vic­tims. I also sprayed him with mos­quito re­pel­lent three times a day.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, at the poly­clinic that di­ag­nosed him with dengue, the only ad­vice he was given was to go home and rest. He was not given any ad­vice to stay in­doors or take pre­cau­tions to en­sure that oth­ers would not be in­fected.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple with dengue need to be iso­lated in a closed room to pre­vent mos­qui­toes get­ting to them be­cause their blood car­ries the virus.</p>
    <p>Mos­qui­toes by them­selves are not the cause of dengue. I grew up be­ing bit­ten by mos­qui­toes, but it wasn’t a prob­lem as there was no one with the dengue virus back then in the area where I lived.</p>
    <p>Fu­mi­gat­ing has not and will not get rid of dengue as it’s im­pos­si­ble to ex­ter­mi­nate mos­qui­toes. Per­haps it is time a dif­fer­ent strat­egy was adopted.</p>
    <p>Iso­late ev­ery­one with dengue dur­ing the in­fec­tious pe­riod as we do with all com­mu­ni­ca­ble dis­eases. It may be a more ef­fec­tive op­tion.</p>
