    <p>FairPrice yes­ter­day an­nounced that an air-con­di­tioned truck will, for a start, serve Block 108 Bukit Purmei Road, Block 32 Telok Blan­gah Rise and Block 518 West Coast Road. The truck can hold about 200 prod­ucts and serve up to five cus­tomers at a time, with safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures in place.</p>
    <p>House­wife Nor­lea Hamid pre­vi­ously had to walk about 400m to the near­est su­per­mar­ket to pick up small items she may have for­got­ten to buy while shop­ping for groceries.</p>
    <p>Now, the 58-year-old, who lives in West Coast Road, will need only to walk to the next block, to a FairPrice truck stocked with many items nor­mally found in su­per­mar­kets.</p>
    <p>“I live in the next block so it’s very easy now to pick up some­thing I’ve missed,” said Madam Nor­lea, who lives with her hus­band and son.</p>
    <p>The FairPrice on Wheels ini­tia­tive was first launched on April 23 dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, with five vans sell­ing groceries in five ma­ture es­tates with a higher con­cen­tra­tion of se­niors.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, FairPrice an­nounced that an air-con­di­tioned truck will, for a start, serve Block 108 Bukit Purmei Road, Block 32 Telok Blan­gah Rise and Block 518 West Coast Road.</p>
    <p>The truck can hold about 200 prod­ucts, in­clud­ing fresh fruit and frozen prod­ucts, and serve up to five cus­tomers at a time, with safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures in place.</p>
    <p>FairPrice said that with the air­con truck, it can now sell items that were pre­vi­ously not avail­able on FairPrice on Wheels vans, such as meat and dairy prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>The vans, which FairPrice used dur­ing the pi­lot scheme that ended last month, had car­ried about 40 prod­ucts that were not tem­per­a­ture-sen­si­tive. These in­cluded bread, rice, toi­let pa­per, canned goods and veg­eta­bles.</p>
    <p>As for the truck, about 40 per cent of the items it car­ries will com­prise house brand prod­ucts, to cater to more bud­get-con­scious cus­tomers, said Mr Traves Tan, gen­eral man­ager for su­per­mar</p>
    <p>kets and FairPrice shops at FairPrice.</p>
    <p>He added that the de­ci­sion to ex­pand the range of prod­ucts was based on cus­tomers’ feed­back, as well as a pref­er­ence among el­derly cus­tomers to pick and choose the prod­ucts them­selves.</p>
    <p>FairPrice said that 70 per cent to 80 per cent of the cus­tomers dur­ing the first run were se­niors.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said the three lo­ca­tions cho­sen were based on de­mo­graphic data. Each has a high con­cen­tra­tion of se­niors liv­ing in three-room Hous­ing Board flats.</p>
    <p>He added that the FairPrice on Wheels ini­tia­tive had been in the works last year but was de­layed due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, FairPrice had to use vans in­stead of air-con trucks as an in­terim so­lu­tion dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>FairPrice said it will con­tinue to as­sess the vi­a­bil­ity and cus­tomer re­cep­tiv­ity of the ini­tia­tive in con­sid­er­ing whether to add more trucks and lo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Re­tiree Chua Hee, 77, said he was pleased to see a wider selec­tion of items when he vis­ited the truck in West Coast Road yes­ter­day morn­ing. He pur­chased fruit and veg­eta­bles.</p>
    <p>The truck will be at Block 108 Bukit Purmei Road from Sun­days to Tues­days, be­tween 9am and 2pm. It will be at Block 32 Telok Blan­gah Rise from Sun­days to Tues­days, be­tween 3pm and 8pm, and at Block 518 West Coast Road from Wed­nes­days to Satur­days, be­tween 9am and 8pm.</p>
