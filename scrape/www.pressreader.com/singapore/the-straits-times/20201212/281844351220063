    <p>• Ger­many will have to im­pose tougher coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions be­fore Christ­mas to try to get the pan­demic un­der con­trol, min­is­ters and re­gional lead­ers said yes­ter­day, as daily coro­n­avirus cases and deaths rose the most since the pan­demic started.</p>
    <p>New coro­n­avirus-re­lated fa­tal­i­ties climbed by 604 in the 24 hours through yes­ter­day morn­ing, while cases jumped by an­other 32,734, ac­cord­ing to data from Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Both fig­ures ex­ceeded pre­vi­ous highs reached in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel and the heads of Ger­many’s 16 states are ex­pected to dis­cuss the pan­demic at a meet­ing to­mor­row, ac­cord­ing to lo­cal me­dia re­ports.</p>
    <p>Hos­pi­tals could be­come over­bur­dened, and the virus is spread­ing rapidly among the el­derly. Dr Merkel made an emo­tional ap­peal to Ger­mans this week to rein in year-end cel­e­bra­tions to pro­tect friends and fam­ily.</p>
    <p>In­te­rior Min­is­ter Horst See­hofer said Ger­many needed a hard lock­down be­fore Christ­mas if it wanted to slow the spread of the virus, while the coun­try’s health and econ­omy min­is­ters also said ex­ist­ing measures would have to be ex­tended.</p>
    <p>“This will lead to a lock­down that is sim­i­lar in many ways to what hap­pened in the early part of the year,” Econ­omy Min­is­ter Peter Alt­maier said at a vir­tual news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>The main measures un­der con­sid­er­a­tion are the clo­sure of nonessen­tial shops, plus longer school hol­i­days. Ger­many closed bars, gyms and cin­e­mas early last month, while al­low­ing schools and other busi­nesses to con­tinue op­er­at­ing. The par­tial shut­down – softer than curbs im­posed in coun­tries such as Bri­tain and France – has so far failed to slow the spread of the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Ahead of new na­tional measures, re­gional lead­ers were tight­en­ing lo­cal curbs, with BadenWuert­tem­berg be­com­ing the lat­est state to im­pose a night cur­few.</p>
    <p>Ber­lin Mayor Michael Mueller plans to close non-essen­tial stores and ex­tend school breaks un­til Jan 10, join­ing other states in­clud­ing Bavaria and Sax­ony in im­ple­ment­ing more strin­gent curbs. He told ZDF tele­vi­sion on Thurs­day evening that he ex­pects a na­tion­wide lock­down for three weeks start­ing on Dec 20.</p>
