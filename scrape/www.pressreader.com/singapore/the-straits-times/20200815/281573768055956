    <p>About 86,300 work­ers in the lo­gis­tics sec­tor are ex­pected to ben­e­fit from an en­hanced in­dus­try dig­i­tal plan that will help small and medium-sized enterprise­s (SMEs) tai­lor train­ing pro­grammes to meet work­ers’ needs in var­i­ous job roles. The plan also sets out dig­i­tal so­lu­tions for SMEs at dif­fer­ent stages of growth.</p>
    <p>About 86,300 work­ers in the lo­gis­tics sec­tor are ex­pected to ben­e­fit from an en­hanced in­dus­try dig­i­tal plan that will help small and medium-sized enterprise­s (SMEs) tai­lor train­ing pro­grammes to meet work­ers’ needs in var­i­ous jobs.</p>
    <p>The plan also sets out dig­i­tal so­lu­tions for SMEs at dif­fer­ent stages of growth, pro­vid­ing an on­line self-as­sess­ment check­list that could help them iden­tify op­por­tu­ni­ties for im­prove­ment.</p>
    <p>It will give a boost to about 5,300 SMEs in the in­dus­try, in­clud­ing providers of air trans­port sup­port ser­vices, which are new ad­di­tions to the list of ben­e­fi­cia­ries.</p>
    <p>This latest plan, which builds on an ear­lier one launched in 2017 to help lo­gis­tics busi­nesses build their dig­i­tal ca­pa­bil­i­ties, was launched yes­ter­day by Min­is­ter of State for Trade and In­dus­try Low Yen Ling.</p>
    <p>The in­clu­sion of air trans­port sup­port ser­vices will pave the way for such com­pa­nies to be more ef­fi­cient by us­ing dig­i­tal sys­tems and re­al­time data, said En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore and the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity, which had jointly led the en­hance­ment of the plan.</p>
    <p>Speaking to the me­dia at the fa­cil­ity of lo­cal lo­gis­tics player IM Hold­ings, Ms Low said that since the plan’s in­tro­duc­tion three years ago, 90 per cent of com­pa­nies that adopted it have seen an im­prove­ment in man­power and ef­fi­ciency, and more than half have re­duced their op­er­at­ing ex­penses.</p>
    <p>More than 40 per cent of these com­pa­nies have also gained new in­sights in op­er­a­tions and as­set util­i­sa­tion, she added.</p>
    <p>Five new so­lu­tions, in­clud­ing those for dig­i­tal trade plat­forms and ef­fi­cient en­ergy man­age­ment, are part of the en­hanced plan to help SMEs carry out real-time, datadriven de­ci­sion mak­ing and sup­port dig­i­tal col­lab­o­ra­tion among stake­hold­ers in the sup­ply chain.</p>
    <p>Un­der the plan’s train­ing road map, dig­i­tal skills are clas­si­fied into two cat­e­gories – tech ba­sics and tech ad­vanced – to pro­vide more tailored sup­port for work­ers.</p>
    <p>IM Hold­ings is among the SMEs that have gained from dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion ef­forts. For in­stance, a ware­house man­age­ment sys­tem has helped it im­prove in­ven­tory ac­cu­racy by 40 per cent and re­duce over­stock and out-of-stock si­t­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Its ear­lier in­vest­ment in its trans­port man­age­ment sys­tem, which pro­vides real-time track­ing, has also al­lowed it to di­ver­sify its ser­vices to sup­port the health­care in­dus­try dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, by pro­vid­ing medicine col­lec­tion and de­liv­ery to pa­tients.</p>
    <p>IM Hold­ings founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive Ed­die Siow said its next step in­cludes im­prov­ing its sys­tem for col­lect­ing goods be­fore pack­ing them.</p>
    <p>The com­pany puts aside about 15 per cent to 20 per cent of its prof­its for dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and im­prove­ment ef­forts. Although e-com­merce has grown, Mr Siow said “it’s still im­por­tant to have both bricks-and-mor­tar and on­line ca­pa­bil­i­ties”.</p>
    <p>The en­hanced plan was de­vel­oped in con­sul­ta­tion with com­pa­nies as well as in­dus­try part­ners such as the Sin­ga­pore Lo­gis­tics As­so­ci­a­tion and the Cen­tre of In­no­va­tion-Sup­ply Chain Man­age­ment at Re­pub­lic Polytech­nic.</p>
    <p>Other part­ners and re­sources, such as busi­ness ad­vis­ers at the SME Cen­tres and SME Dig­i­tal Tech Hub, will also help the com­pa­nies build up their dig­i­tal ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
