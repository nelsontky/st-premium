    <p>France and Ger­many have or­dered their coun­tries back into lock­down, re­flect­ing alarm at the pace of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic in Europe. Bri­tain re­sisted pres­sure to fol­low suit yes­ter­day, while Switzer­land opted for tighter curbs with­out a to­tal shut­down.</p>
    <p>PARIS • France and Ger­many or­dered their res­i­dents back into lock­down and Bri­tain re­sisted pres­sure to fol­low suit yes­ter­day, as a huge sec­ond wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions threat­ened to over­whelm Europe be­fore the win­ter.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial mar­kets stead­ied some­what yes­ter­day, af­ter a bru­tal sell­off the day be­fore. The prospect of a dou­ble-dip re­ces­sion came ever more clearly into view with the news that two of Europe’s big­gest economies were im­pos­ing na­tion­wide re­stric­tions al­most as se­vere as the ones that drove the global econ­omy this year into its deep­est re­ces­sion in gen­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“The virus is cir­cu­lat­ing at a speed that not even the most pes­simistic fore­casts had an­tic­i­pated,” French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron said on Wed­nes­day. “We are all in the same po­si­tion: Over­run by a sec­ond wave which we know will be harder, more deadly than the first... We need to re­turn to the lock­down which stopped the virus.”</p>
    <p>Un­der the new French mea­sures which take ef­fect today, peo­ple must re­main at home ex­cept when buy­ing essen­tial goods, seek­ing med­i­cal at­ten­tion or ex­er­cis­ing for up to one hour a day. They can go to work if their em­ployer deems it im­pos­si­ble for them to do so at home. Schools will stay open.</p>
    <p>Any­one leav­ing their home in France will now have to carry a doc­u­ment jus­ti­fy­ing be­ing out­side.</p>
    <p>Ger­many will shut bars, restau­rants and the­atres from Nov 2 to 30 un­der steps agreed be­tween Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel and heads of re­gional gov­ern­ments. Schools will stay open and shops can op­er­ate, with lim­its on ac­cess.</p>
    <p>“We are in a dra­matic sit­u­a­tion at the start of the cold sea­son. It af­fects us all, with­out ex­cep­tion,” Dr Merkel told Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day. “The win­ter will be hard.”</p>
    <p>She said her gov­ern­ment had moved quickly to pre­vent in­ten­sive care fa­cil­i­ties from be­ing over­whelmed, and that the new re­stric­tions to re­duce so­cial con­tact were “nec­es­sary and pro­por­tion­ate”.</p>
    <p>France has seen a surge of above 36,000 new cases a day. Ger­many, which was less hard-hit than its Euro­pean neigh­bours ear­lier this year, has seen an ex­po­nen­tial rise.</p>
    <p>In Bri­tain, a new study by Im­pe­rial Col­lege in Lon­don un­der­lined the dire sit­u­a­tion fac­ing the coun­try with the largest num­ber of coro­n­avirus deaths in Europe, show­ing cases in Eng­land dou­bling ev­ery nine days.</p>
    <p>The study’s au­thor, Pro­fes­sor Steven Ri­ley, said the gov­ern­ment should de­cide quickly if it wanted to fol­low France and Ger­many.</p>
    <p>“And sooner is bet­ter than later for these,” the pro­fes­sor of in­fec­tious dis­ease dy­nam­ics told BBC.</p>
    <p>But Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son’s gov­ern­ment con­tin­ued to re­sist pres­sure to im­pose a sec­ond na­tion­wide lock­down.</p>
    <p>Hous­ing Min­is­ter Robert Jen­rick told Times Ra­dio: “The judg­ment of the gov­ern­ment today is that a blan­ket na­tional lock­down is not ap­pro­pri­ate, would do more harm than good.”</p>
    <p>Bri­tain has opted in­stead for a tiered sys­tem of lo­cal con­trols in­tended to tighten mea­sures in af­fected re­gions while leav­ing oth­ers less re­stricted.</p>
    <p>Switzer­land also took the “mid­dle path” in curbs aimed at slow­ing in­fec­tions with­out crip­pling its econ­omy. It or­dered dance clubs closed and added new mask rules while leav­ing the na­tion largely open for busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment in Bern or­dered in-per­son col­lege classes to be halted from next Mon­day, placed new lim­its on sport­ing and leisure ac­tiv­i­ties, and or­dered masks to be worn in packed of­fices, sec­ondary schools and even out­doors if peo­ple can­not keep their dis­tance.</p>
    <p>“We have to work with a scalpel and make very pre­cise cuts,” Health Min­is­ter Alain Ber­set said on Wed­nes­day, re­fer­ring to the tar­geted mea­sures. “If it’s not pos­si­ble to get the virus un­der con­trol, then other mea­sures are pos­si­ble. But we’re try­ing to take a mid­dle path.”</p>
    <p>Public gatherings will now be lim­ited to 50 peo­ple, and sport­ing and cul­tural ac­tiv­i­ties with more than 15 peo­ple will be banned. Bars and restau­rants must close at 11pm, while pri­vate fam­ily gatherings will be capped at 10 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Switzer­land, which in June ap­peared to have had the virus con­tained, saw new cases soar­ing to 8,616 on Wed­nes­day – ac­count­ing for 0.1 per cent of its pop­u­la­tion – in a sin­gle day.</p>
    <p>While lead­ers have been des­per­ate to avoid the crip­pling cost of lock­downs, the new re­stric­tions in Europe re­flect alarm at the gal­lop­ing pace of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The lat­est surge in new cases has put Europe back at the cen­tre of the pan­demic, which has seen more than 44 mil­lion in­fec­tions and 1.1 mil­lion deaths world­wide.</p>
    <p>The re­gion this week ac­counted for al­most half of all new global in­fec­tions in the pre­vi­ous seven days.</p>
    <p>The United States has also seen a surge in new Covid-19 cases, with more than 80,000 new cases and 1,000 deaths on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>By con­trast, many Asian coun­tries have be­gun to re­lax re­stric­tions as the dis­ease is grad­u­ally brought un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>OVER­WHELMED</p>
    <p>We are all in the same po­si­tion: Over­run by a sec­ond wave which we know will be harder, more deadly than the first.</p>
