    <p>The Sungei Bu­loh Wet­land Re­serve has for years been the poster child for man­grove forests in Sin­ga­pore, but now stud­ies have shed light on its qui­etly giv­ing “mother”.</p>
    <p>The Mandai Man­grove and Mud­flat, lo­cated about 3km east of the re­serve, has been found to be the main “seed­ing source” for man­grove propag­ules for many other man­grove ar­eas.</p>
    <p>These ar­eas in­clude the wet­land re­serve, as well as the man­groves in Kranji, Lim Chu Kang and other down­stream man­grove ar­eas, ac­cord­ing to re­search by the Na­tional Parks Board (NParks).</p>
    <p>The find­ings were made through a “pre­dic­tive agent-based model for man­grove propag­ules” devel­oped in 2016 by NParks.</p>
    <p>The model es­sen­tially in­cor­po­rates in­for­ma­tion on cur­rents, habi­tat con­di­tion, and other bi­o­log­i­cal and eco­log­i­cal pa­ram­e­ters of the man­grove propag­ules.</p>
    <p>“Such stud­ies guide our con­ser­va­tion and habi­tat en­hance­ment ef­forts,” said Dr Adrian Loo, group direc­tor of con­ser­va­tion at NParks.</p>
    <p>“The de­ci­sion to safe­guard buf­fer zones and com­ple­men­tary wet­land habi­tats around the Sungei Bu­loh Wet­land Re­serve was de­ter­mined through ex­ten­sive re­search that es­tab­lished the eco­log­i­cal con­nec­tiv­ity and com­ple­men­tar­ity be­tween the sites,” he added.</p>
    <p>Last month, the Sungei Bu­loh Na­ture Park Net­work was launched in an ef­fort to safe­guard wet­land habi­tats and strengthen the con­ser­va­tion of wet­land bio­di­ver­sity in the north­ern re­gion.</p>
    <p>Key habi­tats along this net­work in­clude the ex­ist­ing Sungei Bu­loh Wet­land Re­serve and Kranji Marshes, as well as the up­com­ing Mandai Man­grove and Mud­flat, which was des­ig­nated a na­ture park in 2018 and is es­ti­mated to open to the public in 2022.</p>
    <p>These habi­tats are also cru­cial feed­ing grounds for wildlife.</p>
    <p>Bird sur­veys, as well as ra­dio and satel­lite track­ing tech­nol­ogy, have shown that the ma­jor­ity of the shore­birds that roost in Sungei Bu­loh Wet­land Re­serve at high tide will for­age at the ex­ten­sive Mandai mud­flat ex­posed at low tide.</p>
    <p>“This means that both sites are eco­log­i­cally in­ter-de­pen­dent habi­tats for shore­birds,” said Dr Loo.</p>
    <p>On land, trees usu­ally pro­duce seeds that get dis­persed and ger­mi­nate there­after.</p>
    <p>But many man­grove species are unique in that they have seeds that ger­mi­nate while still on the par­ent plant. At this stage, they are known as propag­ules.</p>
    <p>“The propag­ules de­tach from the par­ent plants and are dis­persed by wa­ter un­til they are im­planted in a favourable lo­ca­tion,” said Dr Loo.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore man­grove ex­pert Dan Friess said hav­ing a good source of propag­ules is the first step for a thriv­ing net­work of man­groves in the north.</p>
    <p>But propag­ules also face many chal­lenges be­fore be­com­ing trees.</p>
    <p>“Most im­por­tantly, it has to find a place where the con­di­tions are suit­able to grow. This means a place where there aren’t too many waves to dis­lodge it, and where the reg­u­lar ti­dal flood­ing is at a level that the seedling can tol­er­ate,” said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Friess.</p>
    <p>Dr Loo said NParks will con­tinue to work with re­searchers and other ex­perts to val­i­date and build on the man­grove model, to in­crease un­der­stand­ing of the eco­log­i­cal con­nec­tiv­ity be­tween man­grove ar­eas in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with The Straits Times ear­lier this month, Na­tional Devel­op­ment Min­is­ter Des­mond Lee had noted that the tus­sle be­tween devel­op­ment and con­ser­va­tion will be a peren­nial chal­lenge for land-scarce Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>But sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy could help in the de­ci­sion-mak­ing process, he added, cit­ing the con­ser­va­tion of the Mandai Man­grove and Mud­flat as a na­ture park.</p>
    <p>The Mandai Man­grove and Mud­flat, lo­cated about 3km east of Sungei Bu­loh Wet­land Re­serve, has been found to be the main “seed­ing source” for man­grove propag­ules for many other man­grove ar­eas.</p>
    <p>“The Mandai Man­grove and Mud­flat will be what it will, be­cause we have agent-based mod­el­ling... (to de­ter­mine) where are the sources and sinks,” he said.</p>
    <p>This had also been done for the Sis­ters’ Is­lands Marine Park, Mr Lee added.</p>
    <p>“It is what it is in terms of its cur­rent sta­tus as a marine park be­cause of sci­ence and data... and then we make the case, and then we strike a bal­ance.”</p>
