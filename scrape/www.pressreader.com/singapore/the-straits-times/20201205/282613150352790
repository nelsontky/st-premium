    <p>LON­DON • Manch­ester United still re­main frus­trat­ingly in­con­sis­tent, but three straight Pre­mier League wins means they only trail lead­ers Tot­ten­ham by five points.</p>
    <p>They also have a game in hand and should re­sults go their way, the Red Devils could break into the top four for the first time this sea­son with a win at West Ham to­day.</p>
    <p>That is the end re­sult United man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer is tar­get­ing as his side visit the Lon­don Sta­dium, in­sist­ing that they have been more con­sis­tent than their crit­ics give them credit for.</p>
    <p>“Of course, it (get­ting back into the top four) would be for all sorts of rea­sons, we know we’ve got a game less and hope we get that back at some point as well,” he said at his vir­tual pre-match press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“With pre-sea­son be­ing as short as it was, to move closer to the top would be a great achieve­ment at this point, and we’ve shown some great con­sis­tency away from home lately and hope we can con­tinue that.</p>
    <p>“How many games do you wanna go back. Foot­ball is a game with hu­man be­ings and live their own lives. We’ve played some fan­tas­tic games, go 40 games back we’re one of the most con­sis­tent in the Pre­mier League.</p>
    <p>“You’re dis­ap­pointed when you lose and it’s fine mar­gins at times that de­cide if you win or lose. The PSG game (in mid­week) was miles bet­ter than West Brom, but you don’t get three points against PSG.</p>
    <p>“We’re get­ting less bad per­for­mances and get­ting more con­sis­tent. You can never con­trol the re­sult in the end, that’s de­cided by fine mar­gins.”</p>
    <p>Like United, un­fan­cied West</p>
    <p>Ham, in fifth place, can also move into the top four with a win.</p>
    <p>These are heady times for a club many had tipped to be sucked into a rel­e­ga­tion bat­tle but David Moyes has done won­ders on a lim­ited bud­get.</p>
    <p>They will also wel­come 2,000 of their home fans for the first time since March and while the hosts can­not call on first-choice for­ward Michail An­to­nio due to in­jury, the man­ager yes­ter­day urged his side to con­tinue to “show the re­silience to get re­sults”.</p>
    <p>While Moyes failed to last a sin­gle sea­son at Old Traf­ford, Sol­sk­jaer is full of re­spect for the job he has done at West Ham.</p>
    <p>“When you’re here it’s the big­gest club in the world and a dif­fer­ent an­i­mal to any­thing else. I re­ally ad­mire David and you see the way West Ham per­form and the re­sults he’s get­ting show his qual­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>United have doubts over Mar­cus Rash­ford, while Luke Shaw is still out but oth­er­wise will travel to Lon­don with a full squad.</p>
