    <p>When a young PhD stu­dent and his pro­fes­sor were study­ing more than 100 stars at an ob­ser­va­tory in south-east France in 1994, they made a dis­cov­ery that rev­o­lu­tionised the world’s un­der­stand­ing of the cos­mos.</p>
    <p>Stu­dent Di­dier Queloz and his ad­viser, as­tro­physi­cist Michel Mayor, no­ticed that one of the stars was wob­bling, a sign that a planet’s grav­ity might be pulling on it.</p>
    <p>A year later, a mo­men­tous an­nounce­ment shocked the as­tron­omy scene: The two Swiss sci­en­tists had dis­cov­ered the first planet out­side the so­lar sys­tem that spins around a sun-like star. Such plan­ets are known as ex­o­plan­ets.</p>
    <p>Find­ing new worlds be­yond the Milky Way be­came a re­al­ity, and the field of ex­o­planet re­search was born.</p>
    <p>Since then, more than 4,000 ex­o­plan­ets have been dis­cov­ered, many of them by Pro­fes­sor Queloz, who is cur­rently a pro­fes­sor of as­tron­omy at the Univer­sity of Geneva, as well as pro­fes­sor of physics at the Univer­sity of Cam­bridge, where he leads a re­search pro­gramme to un­der­stand the for­ma­tion, struc­tures and hab­it­abil­ity of ex­o­plan­ets.</p>
    <p>In 2019, Pro­fes­sor Mayor and Prof Queloz re­ceived the No­bel Prize in physics for their dis­cov­ery of the first ex­o­planet, 51 Pe­gasi b, or­bit­ing a sun-like star.</p>
    <p>Prof Queloz, 54, is one of 21 glob­ally recog­nised sci­en­tists who will speak at this year’s Global Young Sci­en­tists Sum­mit, where over 500 young re­searchers from dozens of na­tions will gather vir­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>The Swiss as­tronomer will de­liver a ple­nary lec­ture on the ex­o­planet rev­o­lu­tion and par­tic­i­pate in a panel dis­cus­sion on re­new­able en­ergy dur­ing the vir­tual sum­mit that runs from to­mor­row to Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Gas gi­ant 51 Pe­gasi b chal­lenged many the­o­ries of planet for­ma­tion that were based on the so­lar sys­tem. It is 50 per cent larger than Jupiter – the big­gest planet in our so­lar sys­tem – and is lo­cated much closer to its star than Mer­cury is to the Sun. Back then, a gas planet lo­cated so close to its star went against sci­en­tists’ ex­ist­ing knowl­edge of plan­ets.</p>
    <p>“We re­ally had a hard time con­vinc­ing our col­leagues that we had a true planet... But many ex­o­plan­ets are awk­ward com­pared with the plan­ets of the so­lar sys­tem, in the sense that they are way closer to the Sun,” Prof Queloz told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The chal­lenge in the next 20 years is to find a so­lar sys­tem twin, added the as­tronomer, since sci­en­tists have al­ready found ex­o­plan­ets with the same mass and size as Earth, and oth­ers that are sim­i­lar to Jupiter and Saturn, for in­stance.</p>
    <p>Prof Queloz strongly be­lieves there is life be­yond Earth, and has said be­fore that humans may dis­cover ex­trater­res­trial life in the next 30 years.</p>
    <p>But life on other plan­ets may not be what we think of as life. The ques­tion is whether the chem­i­cal reaction in one planet trig­gers the cre­ation of mi­cro­scopic life forms or large an­i­mals, or some­thing else, he told ST.</p>
    <p>To fur­ther ex­pand sci­en­tists’ knowl­edge of ex­o­plan­ets, Prof Queloz chaired the Euro­pean Space Agency’s CHar­ac­ter­is­ing Ex­O­Planet Satel­lite mis­sion that aims to un­earth the fea­tures and traits of many of these vast new worlds. The team pub­lished its first pa­per last Septem­ber, with a de­tailed study of one of the most ex­treme plan­ets known – WASP-189b – which is lo­cated 322 light years away from Earth and is a scorch­ing 3,200 deg C.</p>
    <p>“How use­ful is the study of ex­o­plan­ets and the cos­mos? Well, you never know. When Ein­stein de­vel­oped the equa­tions about rel­a­tiv­ity, he would have never guessed that this equa­tion would be used for GPS satel­lites a hun­dred years later,” said Prof Queloz. “The beauty of nat­u­ral sci­ence is that you don’t do it for a pur­pose, be­cause the pur­pose will come from the so­ci­ety at some point.”</p>
