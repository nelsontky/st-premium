    <p>Park­lane shop­ping mall, Al­bert Cen­tre, JCube and the food park at Lorong Lew Lian are among places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients in the com­mu­nity while they were still in­fec­tious, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A pa­tient also went to Bukit Pan­jang In­te­grated Trans­port Hub, while an­other worked at Lee Hung Test Ser­vices and Yale-NUS Research Lab­o­ra­tory.</p>
    <p>An­other pa­tient went to work at Ad­ven­ture Plus.</p>
    <p>Al­to­gether, seven new com­mu­nity cases were re­ported yes­ter­day. These com­prise five Sin­ga­pore­ans or per­ma­nent res­i­dents (PRs), one work per­mit holder and one stu­dent’s pass holder.</p>
    <p>Three were picked up as a re­sult of proac­tive sur­veil­lance and screen­ing, and one had al­ready been placed on quar­an­tine ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Three of the com­mu­nity cases are linked to pre­vi­ous cases or clus­ters, while four are cur­rently un­linked.</p>
    <p>Epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions of the un­linked cases are in progress.</p>
    <p>MOH said that the av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity has de­creased from 18 cases two weeks ago to nine in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has de­creased from a daily av­er­age of nine cases to five over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, MOH also re­ported eight im­ported cases, two of whom are Sin­ga­pore­ans or PRs who re­turned to Sin­ga­pore from In­dia on July 6 and from Pak­istan on July 4.</p>
    <p>Three cases are work pass hold­ers and one is a work per­mit holder. An­other case is a de­pen­dant’s pass holder. They ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore from In­dia be­tween July 6 and Wed­nes­day. All of them had been placed on 14-day stay-home no­tice upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, and had been tested dur­ing that time.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing im­ported case ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore from the Philip­pines on Thurs­day, and was sent to the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases as he was symp­to­matic. He is a sailor cur­rently hold­ing a spe­cial pass who will join a ves­sel that called in a port here.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries make up 187 of the 202 cases an­nounced yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 47,655.</p>
    <p>MOH also an­nounced new clus­ters in dor­mi­to­ries at 72 Tagore Lane and 54 Tech Park Cres­cent.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the clus­ters at Changi Lodge II and Sungei Ten­gah Lodge have been closed as they have not had new cases linked to them for 28 days, or two in­cu­ba­tion pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>With 256 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 43,818 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 169 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, with none in the in­ten­sive care unit, while 3,626 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>The full list of lo­ca­tions where in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients have vis­ited can be found on MOH’s website. The times of their vis­its have also been pub­lished so that peo­ple who had been to these places at spe­cific pe­ri­ods can mon­i­tor their health for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>MOH as­sured the pub­lic that there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned if needed.</p>
    <p>Even as coun­tries rush to ease lock­downs, places like Hong Kong and Mel­bourne have had to reim­pose re­stric­tions as coro­n­avirus cases rise in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>When peo­ple gather in a big group, they can be ex­posed to all the peo­ple that oth­ers in the group have been ex­posed to. It is why pub­lic health mea­sures such as phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing are go­ing to be a way of life, pos­si­bly un­til a vac­cine be­comes widely avail­able.</p>
    <p>The Sun­day Times asked 15 peo­ple, in­clud­ing in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­perts, doc­tors and nurses, when they plan to start do­ing 18 com­mon ac­tiv­i­ties such as eat­ing out, go­ing to a wed­ding func­tion and shak­ing hands.</p>
    <p>Al­though they are on the front lines of this war against Covid-19, their an­swers var­ied.</p>
    <p>Two ac­tiv­i­ties, though, are pop­u­lar in this phase: 11 of the 15 seem happy to go get a hair­cut.</p>
    <p>The same num­ber also would not let the coro­n­avirus get to the foodie in them. They are happy to eat out, be it at a hawker cen­tre, food­court or restau­rant, though one would do it only in phase three while three ex­perts plan to do so only when a vac­cine is avail­able, which could be a year from now.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is now in phase two of a grad­ual re­open­ing. Peo­ple can now gather in groups of up to five and house­holds can re­ceive up to five vis­i­tors at any one time, among other rules.</p>
    <p>Phase two started on June 19, nearly three weeks af­ter the end of a two-month cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Phase three, which will last un­til a vac­cine is found, will start months from now, the Gov­ern­ment said early this month. When it comes, so­cial, cul­tural, re­li­gious and busi­ness gath­er­ings or events would re­sume, al­though gath­er­ing sizes would still have to be lim­ited in or­der to pre­vent large clus­ters from aris­ing, for in­stance.</p>
    <p>Seven out of the 15 in­di­cated that they would work in an open of­fice now, with phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing in place. For most, how­ever, at­tend­ing a wed­ding func­tion, over­seas recre­ational trips or watch­ing a movie can wait.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, would at­tend a wake now, but a wed­ding only in phase three as this is slightly riskier due to the typ­i­cal so­cial­is­ing and row­dier in­ter­ac­tions com­mon at mat­ri­mo­nial bashes.</p>
    <p>Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert at Mount El­iz­a­beth Novena Hos­pi­tal, said he is com­fort­able with eat­ing out now, but you would not find him ex­er­cis­ing in a gym or shak­ing hands un­til phase three.</p>
    <p>TRAV­EL­LING FOR FUN WILL HAVE TO WAIT</p>
    <p>In­fec­tious dis­ease ex­pert Paul Tam­byah from NUS’ Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine and a se­nior con­sul­tant at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal would also eat out now, though he would do so only when there are fewer peo­ple around and avoid un­hy­gienic or over­crowded en­vi­ron­ments.</p>
    <p>In his view, hugs are not a good idea now. “I al­most never hug any­one out­side the fam­ily since I was a kid. If some­one hugs me in phase three, I will not run away!” he said. That is also when he would con­sider trav­el­ling by air­plane or not wear­ing a mask, which he finds un­com­fort­able, pro­vided those are al­lowed.</p>
    <p>For now, in­stead of fly­ing to Bos­ton in the United States for meet­ings at the head­quar­ters of the In­ter­na­tional So­ci­ety of In­fec­tious Dis­eases, where he was ap­pointed pres­i­dent-elect a few months ago, he will meet them on­line.</p>
    <p>“I am one of those who think the virus may just dis­ap­pear by the end of the year, or mu­tate to be less vir­u­lent,” he said. “If the virus is con­trolled in the south­ern hemi­sphere (South Amer­ica and Aus­trala­sia) and the trop­ics, there is a chance that in Oc­to­ber or Novem­ber, we will not see the dreaded sec­ond wave sim­i­lar to the 1918 in­fluenza pan­demic. That is a big ‘if’.”</p>
    <p>Some ex­perts said they would be okay fly­ing in phase three, al­though the de­mand might be af­fected by the num­ber of des­ti­na­tions that are open.</p>
    <p>Prof Teo said he be­lieves there will be a strictly re­stricted list of des­ti­na­tions from Sin­ga­pore for mass mar­ket tourism in phase three.</p>
    <p>“Whether I will choose to travel for recre­ation be­fore a vac­cine is avail­able, will re­ally de­pend on the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in the des­ti­na­tion coun­try,” he added.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans who love to take week­end trips will have to wait. Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia said last week that they will start lim­ited cross-bor­der travel on Aug 10, but that is for long-term pass hold­ers and those on es­sen­tial or of­fi­cial busi­ness.</p>
    <p>WHEN CAN I SHAKE HANDS AGAIN?</p>
    <p>Say­ing no to hand­shakes be­came trendy when Covid-19 cases rose ear­lier in the year, and the risk of be­ing in­fected through touch­ing some­one’s con­tam­i­nated hands is enough for two ex­perts to not want to do so un­til a vac­cine is found.</p>
    <p>A few would shake hands only in phase three, but some, like As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Hsu Li Yang, the pro­gramme leader of in­fec­tious dis­eases at the Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, have no qualms do­ing it now.</p>
    <p>“I just make sure I don’t touch my face af­ter that,” said Prof Hsu, who has had a hair­cut and would eat at a hawker cen­tre or a restau­rant. How­ever, he does not plan to stop wear­ing a mask un­til a vac­cine is found.</p>
    <p>Dr Piotr Ch­lebicki, an in­fec­tious dis­eases spe­cial­ist at Mount Alver­nia Hos­pi­tal, who thinks that things will re­turn to nor­mal only af­ter a vac­cine is avail­able, also plans to con­tinue wear­ing a mask in en­closed spa­ces un­til such time.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is nearly six months into the Covid-19 out­break and the yearn­ing for a sense of nor­mal­ity is deep­en­ing.</p>
    <p>Nurse man­ager Ju­lianah Omar from the Ur­gent Care Cen­tre at Alexan­dra Hos­pi­tal (AH) wants to go to Jo­hor Baru to shop for gro­ceries, but is happy to have an ex­cuse to not have to hug some­one as a form of greet­ing.</p>
    <p>Most of the re­spon­dents re­port that there is noth­ing they would stop do­ing for good, al­though Dr Laureen Wang, who used to go to the gym twice a week, may give that up af­ter dis­cov­er­ing the fun of fol­low­ing app-based work­outs and YouTube fit­ness videos at home.</p>
    <p>“I do not plan to ex­er­cise in a gym as I en­joy my newly found al­ter­na­tives much more, and it’s quite easy to have lapses in hy­giene prac­tices in the gym such as en­sur­ing that the ma­chines are well-sani­tised be­fore pass­ing it on to the next per­son,” said Dr Wang, an as­so­ci­ate con­sul­tant with AH’s car­di­ol­ogy de­part­ment.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers plan to take pre­cau­tions when ex­er­cis­ing in a gym, such as dis­in­fect­ing sur­faces.</p>
    <p>When it comes to go­ing to a pub or club, some are happy to do it in phase three and oth­ers, like Prof Teo, will do so only when a vac­cine is avail­able as the risk of be­ing in­fected can be high, de­pend­ing on the set­ting.</p>
    <p>Drink­ing in an out­door pub can be quite dif­fer­ent from danc­ing shoul­der-to-shoul­der with other drunk peo­ple in an in­door lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Prof Teo said in a re­cent episode of The Straits Times’ talk show The Big Story that the high-risk set­tings are those where peo­ple come to­gether to spend long hours so­cial­is­ing, singing and talk­ing in close prox­im­ity.</p>
    <p>These in­clude clubs and dis­cos, he said, point­ing out that the new spike in Covid-19 cases in Tokyo was traced to a the­atre show star­ring Ja­panese boy-band mem­bers. The au­thor­i­ties there have ap­pealed for more than 800 the­atre­go­ers to get tested.</p>
    <p>RE­TURN­ING TO PRE-COVID-19 LIFE</p>
    <p>The main ac­tiv­ity many ex­pect to carry on do­ing un­til a vac­cine is found is wear­ing a mask when out, with nine out of 15 peo­ple pre­pared to do so. Next comes not trav­el­ling by plane, with seven out of 15 com­fort­able to do so only af­ter a vac­cine comes. Seven out of 15 would also wait un­til then to hug some­one as a form of greet­ing.</p>
    <p>Some ex­perts have said that it will be a year or more be­fore a vac­cine be­comes read­ily avail­able.</p>
    <p>“Even when there’s a vac­cine, there may not be 100 per cent pro­tec­tion, and the pro­tec­tion won’t be life­long,” said Prof Hsu.</p>
    <p>He said a re­cent study done in China sug­gests that those with mild coro­n­avirus dis­ease might have lower lev­els of im­mu­nity against Covid-19 than those who be­come se­verely ill with the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>The study, pub­lished in Na­ture Medicine on June 18, high­lighted the risks of us­ing Covid-19 “im­mu­nity pass­ports”, as an­ti­bod­ies may last only two to three months, espe­cially in asymp­to­matic peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The un­cer­tainty sur­round­ing Covid-19 is why Dr Wang plans to con­tinue us­ing a sur­gi­cal mask in crowded places: “There’s so much we don’t know about the virus. So for now I’ll stick to the mask. It’s min­i­mal ef­fort and I am less likely to catch coro­n­avirus or other types of flu. Like­wise, I am also less likely to in­fect oth­ers. I’m not say­ing it should re­main manda­tory, but I don’t think there should be a stigma at­tached to it even af­ter the pan­demic ends.”</p>
    <p>Prof Teo thinks the world will slowly re­turn to life be­fore Covid-19 when a vac­cine be­comes avail­able. He thinks Sin­ga­pore may be able to get the vac­cine in the sec­ond half of next year. “The ex­ist­ing mea­sures and re­stric­tions are not nor­mal, and while peo­ple keep talk­ing about the ‘new nor­mal’, my sense is that the world (may) al­low a tem­po­rary pause on nor­mal pre-Covid life, but is un­likely to ac­cept a per­ma­nent ces­sa­tion or shift,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It was the same af­ter the 1918 flu pan­demic, and likely will be the same again. So, if there was an ac­tiv­ity I was do­ing prior to Covid-19, I will likely re­turn to it once the world has found a semi- or com­pletely per­ma­nent so­lu­tion for Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>In­deed, Pro­fes­sor An­to­nio Ber­to­letti from the emerg­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases pro­gramme at Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School said: “Per­haps we should relook liv­ing in this state of sus­pended life since the in­fec­tion in Sin­ga­pore and South-east Asia has a mor­tal­ity rate of lower than 0.1 per cent.”</p>
    <p>Life has to go on, and there will al­ways be a slight risk of in­fec­tions as we go about our daily ac­tiv­i­ties, though in this pan­demic, peo­ple should cer­tainly re­main care­ful when in­ter­act­ing with spe­cific per­sons who are in the high-risk groups, such as the elderly and those with un­der­ly­ing ill­nesses, he said.</p>
    <p>Prof Ber­to­letti said he would eat out now, or travel by plane if that is al­lowed, but he would not at­tend a wed­ding, watch a movie or go to a pub un­til phase three.</p>
    <p>His great­est fears in this pan­demic? “That I will never see my kids play­ing free in the park with their friends, and that the so­cial and eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment of our world may be af­fected and mil­lions of peo­ple may re­turn to to­tal poverty,” he said.</p>
    <p>Prof Teo’s great­est fear is that the search for a com­pre­hen­sively ef­fec­tive and safe vac­cine may fail. “Then the world will truly need to ac­cept the ‘new nor­mal’.</p>
    <p>“An­other fear... is that of the coro­n­avirus mu­tat­ing to be­come even more vir­u­lent and, yet, is just as trans­mis­si­ble. Then, that will truly be a night­mare sce­nario, with wide­spread in­fec­tions and fa­tal­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>For now, as peo­ple carry on with life, it is also about find­ing ways to es­cape from it in or­der to re­tain a sense of men­tal well­ness, he said.</p>
    <p>These are ways other than re­ly­ing on so­cial­is­ing with fam­ily, friends and col­leagues, such as cre­ative meth­ods to ex­er­cise in what­ever man­ner is al­lowed or im­mers­ing your­self in your favourite drama se­ri­als or books, he added.</p>
    <p>Prof Teo climbed the stairs at the block where he lives dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker when he could not go to the gym. He has yet to go back to the gym (he uses only the el­lip­ti­cal ma­chine), as he finds stair-climb­ing a good enough sub­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>“Also, I en­joy the out­doors a lot and watch­ing YouTube videos about trekking and camp­ing has pro­vided a form of men­tal es­capism which sur­pris­ingly works,” he added. “These are im­por­tant for ev­ery­one be­cause men­tal and phys­i­cal well­ness helps one main­tain a de­gree of re­silience and pos­i­tive out­look dur­ing what is oth­er­wise a strain­ing time.”</p>
    <p>SO MUCH UN­CER­TAINTY</p>
    <p>There’s so much we don’t know about the virus... so for now I’ll stick to the mask. It’s min­i­mal ef­fort and I am less likely to catch coro­n­avirus or other types of flu. Like­wise, I am also less likely to in­fect oth­ers.</p>
    <p>DR LAUREEN WANG, an as­so­ci­ate con­sul­tant with Alexan­dra Hos­pi­tal’s car­di­ol­ogy de­part­ment, who plans to con­tinue us­ing a sur­gi­cal mask in crowded places for some time.</p>
    <p>EN­SUR­ING MEN­TAL WELL­NESS</p>
    <p>It is about find­ing ways to ‘es­cape’ from the pan­demic in or­der to re­tain a sense of men­tal well­ness; ways which don’t rely on so­cial­is­ing with fam­ily, friends and col­leagues, such as cre­ative meth­ods to ex­er­cise in what­ever man­ner is al­lowed or im­mers­ing your­self in your favourite drama se­ri­als or books.</p>
