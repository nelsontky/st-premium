    <p>France has vowed to speed up the ad­min­is­tra­tion of Covid-19 vac­cines, fol­low­ing wide­spread na­tional out­rage over the gov­ern­ment’s slow vac­ci­na­tion cam­paign.</p>
    <p>In a sig­nif­i­cant re­ver­sal of their ap­proach, the French au­thor­i­ties have an­nounced plans to open up to 600 vac­ci­na­tion cen­tres through­out the coun­try and of­fer free jabs to any­one aged 75 and above.</p>
    <p>“We are go­ing to am­plify, ac­cel­er­ate and sim­plify our vac­ci­na­tion strat­egy,” France’s em­bat­tled Health Min­is­ter Olivier Veran told the me­dia.</p>
    <p>But the task of catch­ing up with vac­ci­na­tion rates achieved by some of France’s key Euro­pean neigh­bours such as Bri­tain or Ger­many re­mains daunt­ing.</p>
    <p>Equally large is the dam­age in­flicted on the cred­i­bil­ity of French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron, who plans to kick-start his re-elec­tion cam­paign this year.</p>
    <p>Un­like Bri­tain – which has a pop­u­la­tion size al­most iden­ti­cal to that of France and has al­ready vac­ci­nated well over one mil­lion peo­ple – the French au­thor­i­ties have man­aged to vac­ci­nate pre­cisely 516 pa­tients dur­ing the first week of France’s cam­paign, a sim­i­lar num­ber to what Ger­many ad­min­is­ters in around 30 min­utes of each work­ing day.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties ex­plained that the chief rea­son for this as­ton­ish­ingly low per­for­mance is deep-seated sus­pi­cions among or­di­nary French cit­i­zens about the vac­cines’ safety.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Ip­sos, one of the coun­try’s top opin­ion poll­sters, just four in 10 French peo­ple said they in­tend to re­ceive a coro­n­avirus vac­cine, the low­est score from any de­vel­oped coun­try. By con­trast, 70 per cent of Ger­mans and 77 per cent of Bri­tons said they will get im­mu­nised.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the French gov­ern­ment adopted a de­lib­er­ately slow vac­cine roll-out, de­signed to first re­as­sure the pub­lic about the jabs be­fore of­fer­ing them to the pop­u­la­tion at large. The bat­tle against the virus would start with a fight for the minds of French­men and women.</p>
    <p>A de­ci­sion was made that care homes for the el­derly will be tar­geted first.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery per­son was asked for con­sent and had to sign a 45-page form be­fore the vac­cine was ad­min­is­tered. Also, a qual­i­fied doc­tor had to su­per­vise the ad­min­is­tra­tion of each vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Alain Fis­cher, the gov­ern­ment’s vac­ci­na­tion co­or­di­na­tor and a dis­tin­guished bi­ol­o­gist, ini­tially claimed the ap­proach gave France “the op­por­tu­nity to do things well in terms of se­cu­rity, ef­fec­tive­ness, or­gan­i­sa­tion and ethics”.</p>
    <p>The strat­egy was a disas­ter at ev­ery level.</p>
    <p>France’s coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion rates have risen sharply, and no­body could ex­plain why the vac­ci­na­tion cam­paigns launched through­out Eu­rope some­how failed to touch France’s main ci­ties, even though the coun­try is tak­ing delivery of around 500,000 doses of the vac­cine de­vel­oped by Pfizer each week.</p>
    <p>“Is France get­ting the dunce’s hat in Eu­rope for vac­ci­na­tions?” said the in­flu­en­tial Le Monde daily, which branded the whole ex­pe­ri­ence a “fi­asco”. Even France’s Na­tional Academy of Medicine blamed the gov­ern­ment for tak­ing “ex­ces­sive pre­cau­tions”.</p>
    <p>With crit­i­cism snow­balling, of­fi­cials close to Mr Macron let it be known that he is “fu­ri­ous” with the pace of vac­ci­na­tions, which he dis­missed as “not wor­thy of France”.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent also called a spe­cial cri­sis meet­ing with Prime Min­is­ter Jean Cas­tex and other min­is­ters at the start of the week to dis­cuss the vac­cine roll-out.</p>
    <p>France is now in a race to catch up. The es­tab­lish­ment of vac­ci­na­tion cen­tres in key towns and ci­ties rep­re­sents a com­plete re­ver­sal from the pre­vi­ous strat­egy. Con­sent forms are to be sim­pli­fied and may be dis­carded.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors have also been al­lowed to su­per­vise at the same time a few nurses ad­min­is­ter­ing the vac­cine. And the pool of those el­i­gi­ble to be vac­ci­nated has now been ex­panded con­sid­er­ably.</p>
    <p>But as they race ahead, the au­thor­i­ties seem to be stum­bling from one con­tro­versy to the next.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment spokesman Gabriel At­tal promised that France will in­oc­u­late 14 mil­lion peo­ple over the next six months. Yet, Trans­port Min­is­ter Jean-Bap­tiste Djeb­bari put the fig­ure at 26 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, most or­di­nary French­men and women are wait­ing for the sight of even one vac­ci­na­tion cen­tre.</p>
