    <p>•</p>
    <p>Midtjyl­land are a cred­i­ble threat that can­not be taken lightly and Liver­pool do not see them as a “small team” in the Cham­pi­ons League, man­ager Jur­gen Klopp said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Dan­ish club qual­i­fied for the Cham­pi­ons League group stage for the first time this sea­son but the Ger­man claimed he has been aware of their project even be­fore he took over at An­field in 2015.</p>
    <p>“We don’t see (Midtjyl­land) as a small team. They are there be­cause they earned the right to be there,” Klopp told re­porters ahead of to­day’s Group D game at home.</p>
    <p>“I know the story of the club, the things they tried. Very in­ter­est­ing project. Five years ago, in my break, I was in­ter­ested to go there... to see how things are done there, but then I signed for Liver­pool.</p>
    <p>“They are re­ally good, it’s a real chal­lenge... They are a bit more di­rect in their build-up. They have re­ally ex­pe­ri­enced de­fend­ers, good foot­balling mid­field­ers, speed on the wings, phys­i­cal­ity in the cen­tre up front. They have a clear plan.”</p>
    <p>Liver­pool are still in the midst of an in­jury cri­sis, with Klopp con­firm­ing that mid­field­ers Thi­ago Al­can­tara and Naby Keita and de­fender Joel Matip were un­likely to play.</p>
    <p>With de­fen­sive linch­pin Vir­gil van Dijk also side­lined with a knee in­jury which could po­ten­tially rule him out for the rest of the sea­son, the Reds have adapted with de­fen­sive mid­fielder Fabinho act­ing as his stand-in. But Klopp ad­mit­ted that his new-look back­line needed more time to gel.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery team in the world would miss Vir­gil van Dijk, he’s the best cen­tre-half in the world. He played pretty much all the games since he’s been here in the past three years,” he added.</p>
    <p>“All the boys have played to­gether with Vir­gil... They are not used to each other, as other pair­ings. That will get bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>At least the hosts were able to wel­come back first-choice goal­keeper Alis­son, who has made an ear­lierthan-ex­pected re­cov­ery and started in the Premier League win over Sh­effield United last week­end.</p>
    <p>It was ini­tially feared he would be out un­til the mid­dle of next month due to a col­lar­bone in­jury, but he said he had the club’s phys­io­ther­a­pists and fit­ness staff to thank af­ter re­turn­ing ahead of sched­ule.</p>
    <p>The Brazil No. 1 agreed that van Dijk would be missed but his ab­sence would not dis­tract the team from achiev­ing their goals this sea­son. “We don’t need to change the way we play but we can­not deny we will miss Vir­gil, he’s one of the best in the world,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We have to fo­cus on the next chal­lenge. Group stage you think points but we just pre­pare as best we can to get the points.”</p>
