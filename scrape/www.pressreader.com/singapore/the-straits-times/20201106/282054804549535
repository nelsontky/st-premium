    <p>BRI­TAIN</p>
    <p>There has been much un­hap­pi­ness over large le­gal aid fees, es­pe­cially in cases where such aid was spent on lengthy tri­als in which de­fen­dants were ul­ti­mately con­victed.</p>
    <p>In one case, Ben But­ler and his part­ner Jen­nie Gray were con­victed of mur­der­ing But­ler’s sixyear-old daugh­ter and of child cru­elty. They were both granted nearly $2.64 mil­lion in le­gal aid ex­penses, cov­er­ing their crim­i­nal cases and a cus­tody bat­tle with the child’s grand­par­ents.</p>
    <p>There are also re­ports of rich de­fen­dants who re­ceived le­gal aid as their as­sets were frozen, but re­mained wealthy as not all their as­sets were seized.</p>
    <p>In 2012, about 50 de­fen­dants with more than $1.76 mil­lion in il­le­gally ob­tained as­sets were found to have re­ceived le­gal aid.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, Lon­don met­als trad­ing ty­coon Viren­dra Ras­togi, who owned a $10.55 mil­lion home and was chauf­feur-driven to court daily, was given $8.79 mil­lion worth of aid.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish gov­ern­ment has had to im­ple­ment dras­tic cuts to le­gal aid bud­gets since 2012.</p>
    <p>Lawyers deemed the re­formed fees as in­ad­e­quate, and went on strike in 2014 and 2018, dis­rupt­ing court pro­ceed­ings and de­lay­ing the res­o­lu­tion of crim­i­nal cases.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, a drug dealer was able to keep his al­leged $7.9 mil­lion for­tune, be­cause of de­lays in find­ing him a le­gal aid lawyer for con­fis­ca­tion hear­ings.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the 2018 strike, the le­gal aid lawyers were given a $40 mil­lion fee rise.</p>
    <p>HONG KONG</p>
    <p>Hong Kong has a fully gov­ern­ment-funded pub­lic de­fender scheme that out­sources part of its cases to pri­vate lawyers and the Law So­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>It spent a to­tal of $217 mil­lion on civil and crim­i­nal le­gal aid in 2017, and has ex­pe­ri­enced es­ca­lat­ing le­gal aid bud­gets, ow­ing to a con­tin­ual in­crease in lawyers’ fees of around 4 per cent to 10 per cent yearly.</p>
    <p>AUS­TRALIA</p>
    <p>New South Wales of­fers a fully gov­ern­ment­funded pub­lic de­fender scheme, in which twothirds of its cases are out­sourced to pri­vate lawyers.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment ex­pen­di­ture on crim­i­nal le­gal aid has seen a 50 per cent rise from 2015 to last year.</p>
    <p>Lloyd Rayney, a lawyer ac­cused of mur­der­ing his wife, re­ceived about $2.3 mil­lion in le­gal aid in 2013. Paul Cohrs was ac­cused of mur­der­ing his mother and brother in 2018. He had al­most $1.5 mil­lion in as­sets but re­ceived le­gal aid as the as­sets were frozen.</p>
    <p>NEW ZEALAND</p>
    <p>Its fully gov­ern­ment-funded pub­lic de­fender scheme saw to­tal costs soar­ing 62 per cent from $101 mil­lion in 2006/2007 to $164 mil­lion in 2018/2019.</p>
    <p>An in­de­pen­dent re­view in 2009 found the sys­tem was open to abuse by lawyers. They de­layed or changed pleas mid­way through the le­gal process, max­imised le­gal aid pay­ments, and de­manded or ac­cepted top-up pay­ments from clients.</p>
