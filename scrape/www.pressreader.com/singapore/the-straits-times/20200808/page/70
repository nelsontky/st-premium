        Special Focus C16 | SATURDAY, AUGUST 8, 2020 Essentials for easy living and working Safe Phase 2 house hunting tips By ARUL JOHN You must have been crushed when the Circuit Breaker measures made it hard for you to view your dream properties. But Phase 2 means that you can go back to viewing your dream properties again.
But the following safe management measures must be followed to minimise the risk of
COVID-19 transmissi­on:
• Viewings are by appointmen­t only with fixed time slots; no open house or walk-ins are allowed Everyone must log their entrance and exit timings to the show gallery they visit to facilitate contact tracing
• Each show gallery and within show units must have a maximum capacity based on a minimum of 10 sqm per person
• Group viewings are limited to a maximum of five persons, including salesperso­ns and prospectiv­e buyers • A minimum of 1m distance must be maintained
between individual­s
• Persons who are unwell must not attend.
The salesperso­ns may ask clients who appear unwell to leave and go home/see a doctor
• No mingling or mixing of groups are allowed • All persons must wear masks. Children 12 years or below and persons who have health conditions that may result in breathing or other difficulti­es when a mask is worn for a prolonged period of time, may use face shields instead
All attendees are encouraged to sanitise their hands using hand sanitisers
• Appropriat­e measures must be taken to reduce contact with surfaces
Regular cleaning and sanitising of high-touch areas, such as kitchen counter tops, must take place • No materials must be taken or given out. Flyers, documents and brochures should be delivered via electronic means to clients Similar measures are also in place for viewing completed properties. Take note of the following points:
• Viewing is by appointmen­t only.
• Start and end times must be clearly stated
and adhered to
• Duration of viewing should be as short
as possible
• Persons from different households must
maintain 1m safe distance at all times • Persons who are unwell must not attend
• All attendees are encouraged to sanitise their
hands using hand sanitisers
• Viewing records must be kept, manually
or digitally. The seller’s agent may register a SafeEntry QR code for the property prior to any viewing and require all visitors to sign in/out
If no seller’s agent is involved, the buyer’s agent can register for a SafeEntry QR code before the viewing
Back-to-back viewings are not allowed. There should be a time gap between appointmen­ts to prevent gatherings or physical interactio­ns between groups of viewers/other people.onic means to clients • • • • • PHOTO: Gettyimage­s Photo: SPH MEDICFLOW TAPING KNEE SLEEVE OWELL MEDICFLOW PLUS & MINI S NANO-ZINC REUSABLE FACE MASK OWELL OCTA COMPRESSIO­N SOCKS DID YOU KNOW?
