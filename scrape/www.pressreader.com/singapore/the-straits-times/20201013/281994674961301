    <p>High Court judge Hoo Sheau Peng ac­cepted de­fence ar­gu­ments that two years and nine months’ jail would suf­fice as pun­ish­ment for Tan Tian Chye’s acts of caus­ing the loss of life of a loved one.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Hoo noted that the par­ties were not far apart in their sub­mis­sions on an ap­pro­pri­ate sen­tence; prose­cu­tors had asked for three years’ jail.</p>
    <p>She took guid­ance from the prece­dent case of Lim Ah Seng, who was sen­tenced to 21/ years’</p>
    <p>2 jail in 2007 for stran­gling his abu­sive wife.</p>
    <p>The judge noted that Tan was at low risk of re­of­fend­ing and was re­spond­ing to treat­ment.</p>
    <p>“The ac­cused will no doubt con­tinue to suf­fer the pain and an­guish of his ac­tion well af­ter his im­pris­on­ment term,” she said.</p>
    <p>“It is, I be­lieve, the wish of all of us present that the ac­cused as well as his fam­ily will, with time, come to terms with what they have un­der­gone, and ex­pe­ri­ence a mea­sure of clo­sure and heal­ing in their lives.”</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Hoo also drew at­ten­tion to wider is­sues on men­tal health. “As a so­ci­ety, it is crit­i­cal to con­tinue with ef­forts to im­prove and en­hance ac­cess to men­tal health ser­vices,” she said.</p>
    <p>“It is un­for­tu­nate that much-needed help, sup­port and in­ter­ven­tion were not sought by or given to the Tan fam­ily dur­ing those years for their daugh­ter and, there­after, for the ac­cused.”</p>
