    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) • This will be the Bos­ton Celtics’ third trip to the East­ern Con­fer­ence fi­nals in four sea­sons, while their op­po­nents, the Mi­ami Heat, are mak­ing their first ap­pear­ance since 2014.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there are no favourites as the best-of-seven se­ries gets un­der way on Tues­day, as this is the first time both the top two seeds in the East are not in the con­fer­ence fi­nals since the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion switched to the 16-team play-off for­mat in 1984.</p>
    <p>Jayson Ta­tum led all scor­ers with 29 points as the Celtics came out tops in Game 7 on Fri­day, elim­i­nat­ing league cham­pi­ons Toronto Rap­tors four games to three af­ter a 92-87 win at Disney World.</p>
    <p>Fred VanVleet had 20 points to pace the Cana­dian team, who had bat­tled back from 2-0 and 3-2 deficits in the se­ries, but came just short in the end.</p>
    <p>The guard missed a game-ty­ing three-pointer with 12 sec­onds left, while Kemba Walker made two free throws at the other end to seal the hard-fought vic­tory, which Ta­tum claimed showed their cham­pi­onship met­tle.</p>
    <p>“If you want to achieve some­thing great, if you want to win, it’s not go­ing to be easy,” the All-Star for­ward said. “That’s what we’re here for.”</p>
    <p>The Rap­tors were left to rue what could have been, with their coach Nick Nurse con­ced­ing “we didn’t play great in this se­ries”.</p>
    <p>But for the third-seeded Celtics, their quest for a first trip to the</p>
    <p>NBA Fi­nals in a decade goes on.</p>
    <p>In their way stand the fifth­seeded Heat. The ri­valry may not be as long­stand­ing as the one with the Philadel­phia 76ers, but there is lit­tle love lost be­tween both teams.</p>
    <p>Much has been made of the dis­taste Bos­ton pres­i­dent Danny Ainge has for his Heat coun­ter­part Pat Ri­ley and vice versa.</p>
    <p>The three pre­vi­ous times they met in the post-sea­son were all heated af­fairs, par­tic­u­larly the most re­cent meet­ing in 2012 when even­tual cham­pi­ons Mi­ami were taken to Game 7 in the East fi­nals.</p>
    <p>This reg­u­lar sea­son, things were sim­i­larly tight, with Celtics win­ning two games to one, though their last con­test a month ago in the “bub­ble” saw the Heat emerge with a win.</p>
    <p>With two Mi­ami play­ers for­merly with Bos­ton, there are also no secrets be­tween both ros­ters.</p>
    <p>Heat for­ward Jae Crow­der, who along with cen­tre Kelly Olynyk used to wear the famed green jer­sey, told lo­cal daily The Sun Sen­tinel: “I do have re­la­tion­ships there. But it’s just com­pe­ti­tion, man.</p>
    <p>“Once I get on the court, I’ve been on the court with my own brother be­fore and I tried to rip his head off. We’re in the play-offs. Both teams are try­ing to fight for one goal.</p>
    <p>“I feel like they won’t take it easy on me and I won’t take it easy on them. So may the best man win.”</p>
    <p>Bos­ton coach Brad Stevens is ex­pect­ing a tough bat­tle, but he feels his team are made of sterner stuff af­ter be­ing taken to the wire.</p>
    <p>We should def­i­nitely be hard­ened,” he said. “We should def­i­nitely have a lot more in our tool­box to go back to. But we also have to get ready for a dif­fer­ent, more unique team now in Mi­ami.”</p>
    <p>In the West, Ja­mal Mur­ray scored a team-high 26 points as the Den­ver Nuggets stayed alive with a 111-105 vic­tory over the Los An­ge­les Clip­pers, re­duc­ing the deficit to 3-2 and en­sur­ing a Game 6 to­day.</p>
    <p>Fi­nals Most Valu­able Player Kawhi Leonard led all scor­ers with 36 points, with the Clip­pers still re­quir­ing one more win to reach their first-ever con­fer­ence fi­nals.</p>
    <p>NO QUAR­TER GIVEN</p>
    <p>I feel like they won’t take it easy on me and I won’t take it easy on them. So may the best man win.</p>
    <p>JAE CROW­DER, Mi­ami for­ward, who along with cen­tre Kelly Olynyk, used to play for Bos­ton.</p>
