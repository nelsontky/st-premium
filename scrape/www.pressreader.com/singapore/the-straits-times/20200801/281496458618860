    <p>Not only has Mr Ab­dul Hadi’s home ren­o­va­tion com­ple­tion date been de­layed by three months, the 31-year-old is now look­ing at an ad­di­tional $2,000 to $3,000 in ren­o­va­tion costs.</p>
    <p>The i ncrease i n costs is due mainly to man­power short­age faced by Renodictio­n, the lo­cal in­te­rior de­sign (ID) com­pany he en­gaged, as skilled work­ers, such as car­pen­ters, plumbers and elec­tri­cians, re­main stuck in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Home ren­o­va­tion works, which were halted dur­ing the two-month cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, have been fac­ing de­lays even af­ter works could re­sume af­ter the eas­ing of cir­cuit breaker mea­sures on June 2.</p>
    <p>But Mr Hadi, who works as a safety of­fi­cer in the con­struc­tion in­dus­try and has ex­pe­ri­enced sim­i­lar labour short­ages first-hand, is tak­ing it in his stride.</p>
    <p>When the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion got se­ri­ous, Mr Hadi ex­pected costs might go up, so he set aside some money as a buf­fer. “As some­one in the con­struc­tion in­dus­try, I un­der­stand our ID’s per­spec­tive and I don’t want to pres­sure him on that front,” said Mr Hadi, who is ex­pect­ing a sec­ond child next month with his home­maker wife.</p>
    <p>Ren­o­va­tions for their four-room Build-To-Or­der (BTO) flat in Sengkang were ex­pected to be com­pleted by the end of May, but this has been de­layed to the end of this month.</p>
    <p>Like Mr Hadi, more home own­ers will likely have to pay more for ren­o­va­tion works as the ren­o­va­tion in­dus­try, which is heav­ily re­liant on Malaysian work­ers, con­tin­ues to strug­gle with a labour short­age.</p>
    <p>Home ren­o­va­tion costs have in­creased by 10 to 20 per cent in­dus­try-wide in re­cent weeks, com­pared with pre-Covid-19 days, ac­cord­ing to con­trac­tors and ID com­pa­nies in­ter­viewed by The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>This comes even as more home ren­o­va­tion projects have been given the green light by the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity to re­sume works. Yes­ter­day, BCA told The Straits Times that around 60,000 ren­o­va­tion projects have been ap­proved, in­clud­ing 24,000 res­i­den­tial projects that were pre­vi­ously sus­pended.</p>
    <p>While Mr Hadi can em­pathise with the predica­ment con­trac­tors and ID com­pa­nies are in, the in­crease in costs, cou­pled with mul­ti­tudes of de­lays, may be a tough pill for other home own­ers to swal­low.</p>
    <p>Dr Sky Tan, pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore Ren­o­va­tion Con­trac­tors and Ma­te­rial Sup­pli­ers As­so­ci­a­tion (RCMA), said com­pa­nies will either ab­sorb the costs or pass them on to their new cus­tomers, al­though most firms will try to ne­go­ti­ate for the best price with their ven­dors and sup­pli­ers be­fore do­ing so.</p>
    <p>He added that firms will have to fac­tor any pos­si­ble cost in­crease into their quo­ta­tions to new cus­tomers, while honour­ing the stated prices on con­tracts with ex­ist­ing clients signed be­fore Covid-19 hit.</p>
    <p>Around 80 per cent of work­ers in the trade are Malaysians, said Dr Tan.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies are now pin­ning their hopes on the re­sump­tion of cross­bor­der travel be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia, for which ap­pli­ca­tions will kick off on Aug 10.</p>
    <p>Long-term pass hold­ers and trav­ellers on es­sen­tial or of­fi­cial busi­ness will ben­e­fit from the re­cip­ro­cal green lane and the pe­ri­odic com­mut­ing ar­range­ment.</p>
    <p>To en­sure projects can go ahead, some ID com­pa­nies have had to hire lo­cal work­ers, who com­mand a higher rate, or make do with a re­duced pool of work­ers.</p>
    <p>Renodictio­n’s founder Azri Ab­bas, 43, said around 70 per cent of his work­force is back at work, as the for­eign work­ers he em­ploys have been cleared of Covid-19 and are al­lowed to leave their dor­mi­to­ries to re­sume work. The re­main­ing 30 per cent are Malaysians.</p>
    <p>All of his eight on­go­ing projects have been af­fected, with costs go­ing up “a bit here and there”.</p>
    <p>“I tell my clients, if they don’t want to pay ex­tra and are okay to wait a lit­tle longer, I’ll use my Malaysian work­ers to com­plete their homes when they are al­lowed to come into Sin­ga­pore. But if they want it com­pleted fast, I will have to hire more lo­cal work­ers so costs will nat­u­rally go up a lit­tle,” he said.</p>
    <p>Big­ger com­pa­nies that have their own in-house sub­con­trac­tors have it slightly eas­ier, as they are able to pri­ori­tise avail­able work­ers for their own projects, in­stead of re­ly­ing on ex­ter­nal con­trac­tors.</p>
    <p>Mr Al­loyious Koh, 29, chief creative con­sul­tant of Car­pen­ters De­sign Group, said his com­pany is able to man­age some of the big­ger ren­o­va­tion works such as car­pen­try and hack­ing with its cur­rent work­force.</p>
    <p>Work­ers who are still in Malaysia make up around 40 per cent of his head­count. They are mainly in charge of works such as tiling and false ceil­ing in­stal­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh takes a case-by-case ap­proach when man­ag­ing man­power for his 80 to 100 on­go­ing projects.</p>
    <p>“For clients who don’t have an al­ter­na­tive place to live in or are pay­ing money for rental flats to stay in in the in­terim, we’ll try to pri­ori­tise their projects if we have the man­power to do so. We’re not a heart­less com­pany,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Michael Ong, 40, founder of TBG In­te­rior De­sign, said 90 per cent of his work­ers are back on work­sites, with the re­main­ing 10 per cent still stuck in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong has opted to ab­sorb the ad­di­tional costs for con­tracts that were signed be­fore the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod. He es­ti­mates at least three out of the 12 on­go­ing projects will not yield any profit, while his over­all rev­enue has dipped 30 to 40 per cent.</p>
    <p>He said: “Now it’s re­ally just wait and see if we can sort out travel agree­ments with Malaysia. But even then, we must be pre­pared that it may not be the full work­force.”</p>
    <p>UN­DER­STAND­ABLE</p>
    <p>As some­one in the con­struc­tion in­dus­try, I un­der­stand our ID’s (in­te­rior de­signer’s) per­spec­tive and I don’t want to pres­sure him on that front. ’’</p>

    <p>LABOUR COSTS</p>
    <p>I tell my clients, if they don’t want to pay ex­tra and are okay to wait a lit­tle longer, I’ll use my Malaysian work­ers to com­plete their homes when they are al­lowed to come into Sin­ga­pore.
