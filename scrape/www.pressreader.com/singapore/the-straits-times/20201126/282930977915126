    <p>Tai­wanese singer and tele­vi­sion per­son­al­ity Ting Hsiao-chin (left) has be­come a wanted woman, fol­low­ing her fail­ure to sur­ren­der her­self to serve her 21/ 2- year jail term.</p>
    <p>The 41-year-old had been charged and sen­tenced to jail in Tai­wan for scam­ming cus­tomers on­line i nto buy­ing coun­ter­feit lux­ury goods, such as “Chanel” hand­bags. She was briefly a singer who re­leased two al­bums in 1999 and also known for once dat­ing boy band 5566’s Tony Sun.</p>
    <p>Ting was sup­posed to be­gin serv­ing her jail term on Wed­nes­day morn­ing, but did not show up.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Tai­wanese me­dia re­ports, she had ap­plied for a leave of ab­sence. But the prose­cu­tors’ of­fice in New Taipei District in Tai­wan told re­porters the re­quest was de­clined as it did not fol­low the ap­pro­pri­ate pro­to­col. As such, Ting is now a wanted crim­i­nal.</p>
    <p>News pub­li­ca­tion ET­to­day tried con­tact­ing her on her mo­bile phone but to no avail and she did not re­ply to text mes­sages ei­ther. Her where­abouts are un­known.</p>
    <p>Ting’s trou­bles have been well­doc­u­mented in the me­dia. In 2015, she be­gan sell­ing “lux­ury” goods such as bags, ac­ces­sories and cloth­ing on e-com­merce plat­forms and claimed they were au­then­tic and bought in Europe.</p>
    <p>She had said she was ur­gently look­ing for buy­ers as she was mov­ing.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral peo­ple took the bait and bought her items, only to find out af­ter au­then­ti­cat­ing them that they were fake. Some did not re­ceive the items they had paid for.</p>
    <p>About 12 cus­tomers were duped by Ting and she scammed them of about NT$170,000 (S$8,000).</p>
    <p>She later said she knew noth­ing about the scams as her e-com­merce ac­counts were run by a Sin­ga­porean friend called Natasha. Her de­fence was not ac­cepted by the Tai­wanese court and she was sen­tenced to three years and six months in jail.</p>
    <p>Upon ap­peal, Ting ex­pressed re­morse for her ac­tions and asked for le­niency from the court – which even­tu­ally handed down a 21/ year sen­tence.</p>
