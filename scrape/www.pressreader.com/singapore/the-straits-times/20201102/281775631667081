    <p>PARIS • Si­mul­ta­ne­ously bat­tling the twin crises of the se­cond wave of the coron­avirus pan­demic and a resur­gence i n mil­i­tant at­tacks, French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron faces a defin­ing mo­ment that will de­ter­mine the suc­cess of his term in of­fice and even his chances of re-elec­tion.</p>
    <p>He came to power in 2017 on a wave of op­ti­mism that he was a trans­for­ma­tional leader who would bring much-needed re­form to France and re­store its con­fi­dence as a global player.</p>
    <p>But for two years, he has been be­set by a se­ries of crises: first, from 2018 to last year, more than a year of “yel­low vests” protests against his re­forms, and then a na­tion­wide strike last win­ter over changes to France’s pen­sion sys­tem.</p>
    <p>And just when the strikes dwin­dled and Mr Macron be­gan talk­ing con­fi­dently about what was to come in the “se­cond act” of his man­date, the world was hit by the Covid-19 pan­demic, which forced a na­tion­wide lock­down.</p>
    <p>As France was be­gin­ning to re­cover from the eco­nomic hit of that move, the virus surged again, forc­ing him to an­nounce a fresh lock­down last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The coun­try is now in shock af­ter the be­head­ing of a teacher and the killing of three peo­ple in a church, at­tacks that have been blamed on Is­lamist rad­i­cals and which have pro­pelled the fight against ter­ror to the top of the agenda.</p>
    <p>The mo­tives be­hind the shoot­ing of a priest in Lyon last Satur­day are still not clear.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent pe­riod is the tough­est for Mr Macron since he came to power, said Pro­fes­sor Bruno Cautres, po­lit­i­cal re­searcher for the Paris-based Cen­tre for Po­lit­i­cal Re­search at Sciences Po.</p>
    <p>Mr Macron hoped in sum­mer to re­gain the ini­tia­tive with a €100 bil­lion (S$160 bil­lion) re­launch plan and a strat­egy of “liv­ing with the virus”. But since then, at­tempts to move for­ward have been stymied by ex­ter­nal fac­tors.</p>
    <p>He has never en­joyed wild pop­u­lar­ity – with the lat­est Ifop sur­vey giv­ing him a 38 per cent ap­proval rat­ing – and his party flopped in lo­cal polls ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Eyes are al­ready fo­cused on the 2022 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, where his most likely chal­lenger is far­right leader Marine Le Pen.</p>
    <p>Mr Macron hopes to avoid the same one-term fate as pre­de­ces­sors Ni­co­las Sarkozy and Fran­cois Hol­lande.</p>
    <p>But if Mr Macron wants to emerge vic­to­ri­ous, he needs to “fi­nally get re­sults”, said prom­i­nent po­lit­i­cal commentato­r Philippe Moreau-Chevro­let.</p>
    <p>“If the health sit­u­a­tion does not im­prove by the end of the year or the be­gin­ning of 2021, it will be truly very dif­fi­cult for him. He will be held di­rectly re­spon­si­ble. At this anx­i­ety-in­duc­ing mo­ment, Mr Em­manuel Macron prob­a­bly has the worst job in the world.”</p>
    <p>But po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst Pas­cal Per­rineau said that even if a ma­jor­ity of the vot­ers were “not con­vinced by the Pres­i­dent... then they are even less so by the op­po­si­tion”.</p>
    <p>MOUN­TAIN TO CLIMB</p>
    <p>At this anx­i­ety-in­duc­ing mo­ment, Mr Em­manuel Macron prob­a­bly has the worst job in the world.’’</p>
