    <p>TOKYO • Ja­pan’s ex­ports ex­tended their dou­ble-digit slump into a fifth month last month as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic took a heavy toll on auto ship­ments to the United States, dash­ing hopes for a trade-led re­cov­ery from the deep re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, core ma­chin­ery or­ders, a lead­ing in­di­ca­tor of busi­ness spend­ing, un­ex­pect­edly fell to a seven-year low in June, dash­ing hopes do­mes­tic de­mand would make up for some of the slack from slug­gish global growth.</p>
    <p>The grim data sug­gests the de­pressed con­di­tions seen i n the world’s third-largest econ­omy in the se­cond quar­ter showed no signs of rapid im­prove­ment in the cur­rent quar­ter, com­pound­ing chal­lenges for pol­i­cy­mak­ers as they look to prop up ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>To­tal ex­ports fell 19.2 per cent last month from a year ear­lier, roughly in line with mar­ket ex­pec­ta­tions for a 21 per cent de­crease, govern­ment data showed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It was, how­ever, smaller than a 26.2 per cent drop in June, which some an­a­lysts saw as a sign ex­ter­nal de­mand may have bot­tomed out.</p>
    <p>“To­day’s trade data con­firmed that ex­ter­nal de­mand hit bot­tom and is head­ing to­wards grad­ual re­cov­ery,” said No­mura Se­cu­ri­ties se­nior econ­o­mist Masaki Kuwa­hara.</p>
    <p>“But the pace of re­cov­ery re­mains slow. Given the risk of a se­cond wave of in­fec­tions, it will take a cou­ple of years be­fore ex­ports and (gross do­mes­tic prod­uct) re­turn to pre-pan­demic lev­els.”</p>
    <p>Ship­ments to the US plunged 19.5 per cent in the year to last month as de­mand for en­gines and cars re­mained weak, a sign Ja­pan was feel­ing the pinch from the slow US re­cov­ery amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, au­tomak­ers are tak­ing a heavy hit from the coro­n­avirus, which has shut­tered ve­hi­cle fac­to­ries and kept cus­tomers out of car deal­er­ships. Suzuki Mo­tor Corp said this month its op­er­at­ing profit was nearly wiped out dur­ing the June quar­ter be­cause of plung­ing car sales in In­dia, its big­gest mar­ket.</p>
    <p>In a glim­mer of hope, ex­ports to China – Ja­pan’s largest trad­ing part­ner – rose 8.2 per cent to mark the first in­crease in seven months on brisk de­mand for chip-man­u­fac­tur­ing equip­ment and cars.</p>
    <p>But those to the rest of Asia were down 8.2 per cent, the data showed, re­in­forc­ing ex­pec­ta­tions that a full-fledged re­cov­ery in re­gional trade was still some time off.</p>
    <p>Core ma­chin­ery or­ders, a highly volatile data se­ries re­garded as an in­di­ca­tor of cap­i­tal spend­ing in the com­ing six to nine months, fell 7.6 per cent in June, con­found­ing mar­ket es­ti­mates of a 2 per cent gain.</p>
    <p>For­eign or­ders fell 3.9 per cent in June from the pre­vi­ous month, ex­tend­ing de­clines to a fourth straight month, but slow­ing from dou­bledigit falls seen in April and May.</p>
    <p>To­tal core or­ders slumped to 706.6 bil­lion yen (S$9.15 bil­lion), the low­est since Fe­bru­ary 2013, forc­ing the govern­ment to down­grade its as­sess­ment to say ma­chin­ery or­ders were “de­clin­ing”.</p>
    <p>Man­u­fac­tur­ers sur­veyed by the govern­ment ex­pect core or­ders to fall 1.9 per cent in the cur­rent quar­ter after drop­ping 12.9 per cent in the April to June pe­riod, the data showed.</p>
    <p>A de­cline in the July to Septem­ber pe­riod would mark the fifth straight quar­ter of falls, the long­est streak of de­crease since or­ders slid for six straight quar­ters dur­ing the 2008 global fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>A Tokyo Shoko Re­search sur­vey on Tues­day showed that 8.5 per cent of small firms, or more than 300,000 com­pa­nies, could go out of busi­ness if the pan­demic is pro­longed. Such firms em­ploy seven out of 10 work­ers in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s econ­omy suf­fered a record an­nu­alised con­trac­tion in April to June as the pan­demic crushed de­mand for cars and other ex­ports and kept con­sumers con­fined at home. An­a­lysts ex­pect any re­bound in the cur­rent quar­ter to be mod­est as a resur­gence of in­fec­tions will likely put a lid on de­mand both at home and abroad.</p>
