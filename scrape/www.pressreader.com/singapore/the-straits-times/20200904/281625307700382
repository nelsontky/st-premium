    <p>China yes­ter­day warned the United States to “re­voke the wrong de­ci­sion”, fol­low­ing new US re­stric­tions on Chi­nese diplo­mats. Se­nior Chi­nese diplo­mats will now need ap­proval from the State Depart­ment to visit Amer­i­can univer­sity cam­puses and to meet lo­cal govern­ment of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>China yes­ter­day ob­jected to fur­ther re­stric­tions on its diplo­mats in the United States shortly af­ter they were an­nounced by US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo, say­ing Bei­jing had “al­ways in ac­cor­dance with the law fa­cil­i­tated US em­bassy and con­sulate per­son­nel’s nor­mal ac­tiv­i­ties in China”.</p>
    <p>China’s For­eign Min­istry spokesman Hua Chun­y­ing urged Washington to “im­me­di­ately re­voke the wrong de­ci­sion and stop ob­struct­ing nor­mal per­son­nel ex­changes be­tween the two coun­tries, stop dis­rupt­ing Sino-US re­la­tions”.</p>
    <p>The US was vi­o­lat­ing in­ter­na­tional law and ba­sic norms of in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions, Ms Hua said.</p>
    <p>“This shows the anti-China forces in the United States have lost their ra­tio­nal­ity and self-con­fi­dence, and have suf­fered from anti-China delusions,” she added. China would con­tinue to sup­port “nor­mal ex­changes and co­op­er­a­tion be­tween all peo­ple in the two coun­tries”.</p>
    <p>REC­I­PROC­ITY</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, in Washington, Mr Pom­peo, who an­nounced the re­stric­tions, told jour­nal­ists that the US was “sim­ply de­mand­ing rec­i­proc­ity”.</p>
    <p>“Ac­cess for our diplo­mats i n China should be re­flec­tive of the ac­cess that Chi­nese diplo­mats in the United States have and to­day’s steps will move us sub­stan­tially in that di­rec­tion.”</p>
    <p>Se­nior Chi­nese diplo­mats will now need ap­proval from the State Depart­ment to visit Amer­i­can univer­sity cam­puses and to meet lo­cal govern­ment of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>Ap­proval will also be re­quired for cul­tural events with more than 50 at­ten­dees hap­pen­ing out­side the Chi­nese em­bassy or con­sular posts.</p>
    <p>The State Depart­ment last year re­quired Chi­nese diplo­mats to no­tify it of any meet­ings with lo­cal govern­ment of­fi­cials or events on univer­sity cam­puses – but prior ap­proval was not re­quired. The new rule makes prior ap­proval nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>China does re­quire Amer­i­can diplo­mats to seek ap­proval for meet­ings in prov­inces other than where they are based.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo said: “For years, the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party (CCP) has im­posed sig­nif­i­cant bar­ri­ers on Amer­i­can diplo­mats work­ing in­side the PRC (Peo­ple’s Re­pub­lic of China).”</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can diplo­mats in China are sub­ject to “a sys­tem of opaque ap­proval pro­cesses” that limit their abil­ity to freely in­ter­act with Chi­nese so­ci­ety, on univer­sity cam­puses, with the press and on so­cial me­dia, he added.</p>
    <p>China has taken ad­van­tage of the US’ open so­ci­ety for in­flu­ence and in­for­ma­tion gath­er­ing ac­tiv­i­ties, the US con­tends.</p>
    <p>In July, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion or­dered China’s con­sulate in Hous­ton closed and its diplo­mats ex­pelled, al­leg­ing that the con­sulate was be­ing used for spy­ing.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing re­tal­i­ated by clos­ing the US con­sulate in Chengdu.</p>
    <p>US Un­der­sec­re­tary of State Keith Krach has sent a letter to the gov­ern­ing boards of Amer­i­can uni­ver­si­ties, alert­ing them to threats the CCP poses to aca­demic free­dom, hu­man rights and univer­sity en­dow­ments, Mr Pom­peo said.</p>
    <p>“These threats can come in the form of il­licit fund­ing for re­search,</p>
    <p>in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty theft, in­tim­i­da­tion of for­eign stu­dents and opaque tal­ent re­cruit­ment ef­forts.”</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo also urged di­vest­ment from Chi­nese com­pa­nies on the US Com­merce Depart­ment’s En­tity List.</p>
    <p>He said they were “con­tribut­ing to hu­man rights vi­o­la­tions, mil­i­tary co­er­cion and other abuses”.</p>
    <p>ELEC­TION IS­SUE</p>
    <p>US-China re­la­tions have this year plunged to their low­est point since diplo­matic ties were estab­lished 41 years ago.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has blamed China for the Covid-19 pan­demic, and Congress and his ad­min­is­tra­tion have moved against Chi­nese of­fi­cials as well as com­pa­nies over a range of is­sues.</p>
    <p>The US has cen­sured and banned Chi­nese com­pa­nies and peo­ple in­volved in the build­ing of in­fra­struc­ture in the dis­puted South China Sea and has also taken ac­tion against those in­volved in the in­tern­ment and per­se­cu­tion of Uighurs.</p>
    <p>Pop­u­lar apps like TikTok and WeChat have also been tar­geted, on the premise that they gather data on Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>As the US elec­tion cam­paign en­ters its last two months, China has be­come the top for­eign pol­icy is­sue, with both Pres­i­dent Trump and his ri­val, for­mer vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den, com­pet­ing to be tough on Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>In the con­text of the most re­cent</p>
    <p>LIKE-FOR-LIKE</p>
    <p>Ac­cess for our diplo­mats in China should be re­flec­tive of the ac­cess that Chi­nese diplo­mats in the United States have and to­day’s steps will move us sub­stan­tially in that di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>U.S. SEC­RE­TARY OF STATE MIKE POM­PEO, who an­nounced the re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>ANTI-CHINA DELUSIONS</p>
    <p>This shows the anti-China forces in the United States have lost their ra­tio­nal­ity and self-con­fi­dence, and have suf­fered from anti-China delusions.</p>
    <p>CHINA’S FOR­EIGN MIN­ISTRY SPOKESMAN HUA CHUN­Y­ING</p>
    <p>clash be­tween In­dia and China, Mr Pom­peo said the US hoped for a peace­ful res­o­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>But he added: “From the Tai­wan Strait, to the Hi­malayas, and be­yond, the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party is en­gaged in a clear and in­ten­si­fy­ing pat­tern of bul­ly­ing its neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>“That bul­ly­ing is also ev­i­dent in the South China Sea. Last week, the United States im­posed sanc­tions and visa re­stric­tions on Chi­nese in­di­vid­u­als and en­ti­ties re­spon­si­ble for the CCP’s im­pe­ri­al­ism there, do­ing things such as un­law­ful en­ergy sur­veil­lance, ac­tiv­i­ties in the eco­nomic zones of our ally, the Philip­pines, and other coun­tries.”</p>
    <p>ASEAN MEET­INGS</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo’s re­marks came ahead of his vir­tual par­tic­i­pa­tion in the Asean min­is­te­rial meet­ings, which are due to take place next week be­tween Sept 9 and 11.</p>
    <p>These will in­clude the East Asia Sum­mit For­eign Min­is­ters’ Meet­ing and the launch of the MekongUS Part­ner­ship with the for­eign min­is­ters of Cam­bo­dia, Laos, Myan­mar, Thai­land and Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>“We’ll have dis­cus­sions that will be wide-rang­ing, in­clud­ing on Covid-19, North Korea, the South China Sea, Hong Kong and Burma’s Rakhine state,” Mr Pom­peo said.</p>
    <p>“I’ll also raise how the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion is restor­ing rec­i­proc­ity to the US-China re­la­tion­ship.”</p>
