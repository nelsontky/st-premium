    <p>1 THE FAT KID BAK­ERY</p>
    <p>Score: 90/120</p>
    <p>Price: $4 each, min­i­mum or­der of four pieces</p>
    <p>Info: Or­der via @the­fatkid­bak­ery on In­sta­gram</p>
    <p>Ver­dict: This choco­late sour­dough bom­bolini (bot­tom dough­nut in pic­ture) is the win­ning dough­nut for Mr Bjorn Shen and Mr Len­nard Yeong, which was also the only one to make it into the top three for all four judges.</p>
    <p>Mr Shen gave it full marks for tex­ture and en­joyed the dough­nut more as he ate it.</p>
    <p>Agree­ing, Ms Tan Hsueh Yun said: “The dough­nut is light and I could eat it with­out the filling.”</p>
    <p>Ms An­jali Ragu­ra­man noted that it was the largest of the lot and was gen­er­ously stuffed.</p>
    <p>The choco­late sour­dough bom­bolini is The Fat Kid Bak­ery’s most pop­u­lar flavour, sell­ing up to 500 pieces in a month, said owner Ariel Tang, 24.</p>
    <p>2 NASSIM HILL BAK­ERY</p>
    <p>Score: 85.5/120</p>
    <p>Price: $14 for a mixed box of four (two choco­late and two kaya) Where: 01-03, 56 Tan­glin Road; open: 8am to 10pm, Tues­days to Sun­days, closed on Mon­days Info: Call 6835-1128 or or­der one day in ad­vance at www.or­der.nas­simhill.com.sg Ver­dict: Ms Tan gave this choco­late brioche dough­nut her high­est scores for tex­ture and ap­pear­ance. She said: “The dough­nut is fluffy, light and not greasy. The choco­late flavour could be more in­tense.”</p>
    <p>For Mr Yeong, this was tied for top spot with The Fat Kid Bak­ery in his per­sonal rank­ing. He said: “I like the brioche and this feels the most ex­pen­sive to me.”</p>
    <p>Mr Shen was not a fan as the dough­nut was “not fried enough”.</p>
    <p>In­gre­di­ents such as Elle & Vire but­ter and Val­rhona choco­late set its dough­nut apart from oth­ers, said Nassim Hill Bak­ery’s mar­ket­ing man­ager Brenda Lim, 27.</p>
    <p>3 DOUGH & BAT­TER</p>
    <p>Score: 82.5/120 Price: From $10 for a box of four Info: Go to @dough.and.bat­ter on In­sta­gram or What­sapp 9474-1942 to or­der Ver­dict: Ms Ragu­ra­man de­clared this mini Nutella bom­bolini her “dream dough­nut” as she could not get enough of the Nutella filling. It was also the “per­fect” size for her.</p>
    <p>Mr Shen agreed and said he could pop a few of th­ese mini dough­nuts at one go. He likened it to eat­ing Nutella straight out of a jar.</p>
    <p>The oth­ers felt the filling was overly gen­er­ous. Mr Yeong said: “The filling should be thinned down so that it works more like a ganache in­stead of a paste.”</p>
    <p>Nutella is one of three fill­ings used for Dough & Bat­ter’s dough­nuts. The other two are the best-sell­ing salted caramel hon­ey­comb and sam­bal.</p>
    <p>Pre-or­ders open two to three times a week and owner Ain Ju­raimi takes up to 300 or­ders a day. She said de­mand peaked dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker and Ra­madan pe­ri­ods, where all her slots were fully booked within 10 min­utes.</p>
    <p>4 ALL THINGS DE­LI­CIOUS</p>
    <p>Score: 79/120</p>
    <p>Price: $4.50 (cur­rently $3.50 each till Nov 29)</p>
    <p>Where: 01-01, 34 Arab Street; open: 8am to 6pm daily Info: Call 6291-4252 or or­der at at­d­togo.sg (dough­nuts avail­able only on week­ends and pub­lic hol­i­days) Ver­dict: Mr Shen called this choco­late hazel­nut bom­bolini the “per­fect pack­age”.</p>
    <p>“Its round­ness and the even colour is per­fect. It is just the right size for eat­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan liked that the hazel­nut filling tasted dif­fer­ent from the rest. She said: “I like its light tex­ture and that you get a good flavour of hazel­nuts.”</p>
    <p>The brioche dough­nuts are baked in limited quan­ti­ties at the ha­lal-cer­ti­fied bak­ery cafe, said its founder Dewi Imelda Wad­hwa, 42. Other pop­u­lar flavours in­clude Pis­ta­chio Crunch and Mixed Berry Jam.</p>
    <p>5 BURNT ENDS BAK­ERY</p>
    <p>Score: 74.5/120</p>
    <p>Price: From $24 for a box of six</p>
    <p>Where: Pick up at Level 3, 20 Teck Lim Road; 11am to 4pm, Tues­days to Sun­days, closed on Mon­days</p>
    <p>Info: Or­der at bak­ery.burn­tends.com.sg</p>
    <p>Ver­dict: Mr Yeong gave this Nutella brioche dough­nut the high­est score for ap­pear­ance, while Mr Shen re­marked that its per­fect-look­ing shade of golden brown looked “sexy”.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan felt the dough­nut did not have enough filling but liked the airy brioche with its pleas­ant hint of salt.</p>
    <p>Proof­ing the dough for 24 to 36 hours gives the dough­nut its fluffy tex­ture, said Ms Teresa Tan, 34, head baker of Burnt Ends Bak­ery. The bak­ery sells up to 250 dough­nuts a day and up to 7,000 a month. There is a four-week or more wait for all dough­nut or­ders.</p>
