    <p>When an in­dus­try player – who was un­aware of The Straits Times’ project on Sin­ga­pore’s best law firms – was asked which law firm she thought was the best in town, she named Allen & Gled­hill (A&G).</p>
    <p>“It’s very telling when CEOs of well-known com­pa­nies, fel­low se­nior lawyers and even man­ag­ing part­ners of other law firms send their law grad­u­ate kids to Allen & Gled­hill for their train­ing con­tracts and (they) sub­se­quently go on to qual­ify as as­so­ciates there.</p>
    <p>“This re­flects the trust and con­fi­dence these in­dus­try veter­ans have in A&G, as a firm, as a start­ing point for their next gen­er­a­tion of</p>
    <p>lawyers,” said Ms Lee Shulin, di­rec­tor of Sin­ga­pore-based le­gal re­cruit­ment firm Ansa Search.</p>
    <p>“In my line of le­gal ex­ec­u­tive search, we of­ten en­counter clients re­quest­ing to hire lawyers who’ve had ex­pe­ri­ence work­ing in A&G.”</p>
    <p>Her re­sponse val­i­dated what the project found: Allen & Gled­hill was the sole firm that was placed in all 15 cat­e­gories of Sin­ga­pore’s Best Law Firms 2021, a project un­der­taken by The Straits Times and Ger­man-based re­search firm Statista.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to Allen & Gled­hill, the other Big Four law firms – Ra­jah & Tann, WongPart­ner­ship and Drew & Napier – also made their heavy­weight pres­ence felt in the dif­fer­ent cat­e­gories.</p>
    <p>But oth­ers with brand-name lawyers, like Davin­der Singh Cham­bers and Es­sex Court Cham­bers Dux­ton (Sin­ga­pore Group Prac­tice), also showed up in the cat­e­gory rel­e­vant to them – civil dis­pute res­o­lu­tion (lit­i­ga­tion, ar­bi­tra­tion and me­di­a­tion).</p>
    <p>Se­nior Coun­sel Davin­der Singh heads his name­sake firm, while Es­sex Court lists names like for­mer at­tor­ney-gen­eral V.K. Ra­jah, Queen’s Coun­sel Toby Landau and Se­nior Coun­sel Chan Leng Sun.</p>
    <p>Es­sex Dux­ton chief ex­ec­u­tive David Grief clar­i­fied that the group is not a law firm and its mem­bers are nei­ther part­ners nor em­ploy­ees of the group prac­tice.</p>
    <p>“Rather, Es­sex Court Cham­bers Dux­ton is com­prised of in­di­vid­ual ad­vo­cates, each of whom is a self-em­ployed sole prac­ti­tioner,” he said.</p>
    <p>The 20 best firms named in that cat­e­gory – topped by En­gelin Teh Prac­tice and fol­lowed by Ra­jah & Tann, Drew & Napier, Allen & Gled­hill, WongPart­ner­ship and Oon & Bazul – also pro­vide a nut­shell per­spec­tive of the best law firms here.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey showed that smaller firms fo­cused on a niche area, like in the re­struc­tur­ing and in­sol­vency cat­e­gory, can hold their own.</p>
    <p>These in­clude firms like Black­Oak, which shares a sim­i­lar five-star rat­ing as the Big Four firms.</p>
    <p>Small firms were also prom­i­nent in the crim­i­nal law cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try play­ers gen­er­ally wel­comed the project, point­ing out that users rely on cred­i­ble guides.</p>
    <p>“It is in­struc­tive that the rank­ings fo­cus on law firms rather than per­son­al­i­ties. It sig­nals there has been a shift in the le­gal ser­vices mar­ket about how clients con­sume le­gal ser­vices,” said Mel­bourne-based con­sul­tant Dharmendra Ya­dav, who is with Al­pha Cre­ates, a spe­cial­ist con­sul­tancy for law firms and in-house le­gal teams.</p>
    <p>“The rank­ings recog­nise that a client goes to a firm not for a par­tic­u­lar lawyer, but rather, it is the value propo­si­tion of a com­pre­hen­sive re­gional pro­fes­sional ser­vices firm that at­tracts. This shows a wel­come ma­tur­ing of the Sin­ga­pore mar­ket in the con­sump­tion of le­gal ser­vices.</p>
    <p>“There is a good spread of small and large law firms, which un­der­scores the depth and spread of the re­search un­der­taken. It also shows how di­verse the le­gal ser­vices mar­ket in Sin­ga­pore is.”</p>
    <p>Oon & Bazul’s man­ag­ing part­ner Bazul Ash­hab lauded The Straits Times for “tak­ing on the man­tle of pro­vid­ing a trusted, in­de­pen­dent ap­proach to assess­ing lawyers in Sin­ga­pore”.</p>
    <p>“Users of le­gal ser­vices de­pend greatly on cred­i­ble as­ses­sors. To­day’s rank­ings are tes­ta­ment to the best,” he said.</p>
    <p>The 15 cat­e­gories named a to­tal of 98 law firms, which pos­si­bly makes this the fore­run­ner of a Sin­ga­pore’s Best 100 edi­tion.</p>
