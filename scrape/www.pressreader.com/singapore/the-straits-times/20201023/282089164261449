    <p>I was at Har­bourFront MRT sta­tion on Mon­day af­ter­noon on my way home after my first day back in the of­fice.</p>
    <p>As it was a Pri­mary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tion (PSLE) mark­ing day, I was ex­pect­ing the train to be less crowded but, to my shock, the train was packed by the time it reached Bis­han.</p>
    <p>I can only con­clude that em­ploy­ers are mak­ing their staff go back to the of­fice re­gard­less of whether it is nec­es­sary or not.</p>
    <p>Even though the num­ber of in­fec­tions has been on a down­ward trend, there are still iso­lated cases of in­fec­tion. It takes only one Covid-19 case to trig­ger a re­peat of mass in­fec­tions. And there is no eas­ier place than a packed train for this to hap­pen as there is prac­ti­cally no so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung has been ad­vo­cat­ing that em­ploy­ers con­sider stag­gered hours or flex­i­ble hours. But em­ploy­ers do not seem to be heed­ing the ad­vice.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment should con­sider a more strin­gent ap­proach to en­sure such risks can be suf­fi­ciently mit­i­gated.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, it could im­pose mea­sures that re­quire em­ploy­ers to not al­low all em­ploy­ees to re­turn to the of­fice un­less nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ees who re­quire of­fice equip­ment to per­form their du­ties could be al­lowed to re­turn to the of­fice as much as pos­si­ble to try and nor­malise com­pany op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>How­ever, em­ploy­ees who do not need any equip­ment from of­fice to per­form their roles should not be al­lowed to re­turn to the of­fice.</p>
    <p>With­out a vac­cine in sight, the Govern­ment should ex­er­cise the ut­most cau­tion in en­sur­ing in­fec­tions stay low. This way, busi­nesses can con­tinue op­er­at­ing and ev­ery­one in Sin­ga­pore can stay safe and healthy.</p>
