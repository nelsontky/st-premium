    <p>Changi Vil­lage Hawker Cen­tre has been added to the list of places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were in­fec­tious, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said yesterday.</p>
    <p>This is even as three new coro­n­avirus clus­ters linked to dor­mi­to­ries have emerged.</p>
    <p>Other places added to the list yesterday were a Ko­pi­tiam out­let at Pasir Ris West Plaza and G7 Sinma Live Seafood Restau­rant in Gey­lang.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions and times that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes to get those who were at th­ese places at spe­cific pe­ri­ods to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>MOH has said that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and that there is no need to avoid th­ese places as they would have been cleaned, if needed.</p>
    <p>The min­istry an­nounced three new dor­mi­tory clus­ters as well, lo­cated at 7 Kian Teck Cres­cent, 2 Tech Park Cres­cent and 12 Tech Park Cres­cent.</p>
    <p>It added that six other worker dorms have been cleared of the virus and now house only re­cov­ered in­di­vid­u­als and those who have re­cently tested neg­a­tive for</p>
    <p>Covid-19 in­fec­tion. As a re­sult, the clus­ters linked to the dorms have now been closed.</p>
    <p>The dorms are Cochrane Lodge II in Ad­mi­ralty Road West; Hulett Dor­mi­tory in Senoko Drive, Shaw</p>
    <p>Lodge in Shaw Road, Tampines Dor­mi­tory in Tampines Place, the 31 Sungei Kadut Av­enue dorm, and 230 Wood­lands In­dus­trial Park E5 dorm.</p>
    <p>There were 310 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed by MOH yesterday, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 48,744.</p>
    <p>They in­cluded seven com­mu­nity cases, com­pris­ing three Sin­ga­pore­ans, three work pass hold­ers and one work per­mit holder, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>There were also six im­ported cases – two Sin­ga­pore­ans, a per­ma­nent res­i­dent and three work pass hold­ers.</p>
    <p>The two Sin­ga­pore­ans are a 42-year-old woman and a 44-yearold man who ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore from India on July 12. Both were asymp­to­matic and tested pos­i­tive on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The PR is a 48-year-old woman who re­turned to Sin­ga­pore from Kaza­khstan on July 10.</p>
    <p>She was asymp­to­matic and tested pos­i­tive yesterday.</p>
    <p>The three work pass hold­ers are Filipino women aged 28, 31 and 34.</p>
    <p>They ar­rived here from the Philip­pines on July 8 and July 10. They were asymp­to­matic and were con­firmed pos­i­tive be­tween Tues­day and yesterday.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 297 Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from 13 cases two weeks ago to nine in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from a daily av­er­age of eight cases to five over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
