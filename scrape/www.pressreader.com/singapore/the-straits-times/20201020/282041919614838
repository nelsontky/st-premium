    <p>A Singapore Man­age­ment Univer­sity (SMU) stu­dent al­legedly tar­geted the same woman 19 times, se­cretly film­ing up­skirt videos of her be­tween May 28 and Sept 3 last year.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments did not state the lo­ca­tions where Tien Kiat Chong is said to have com­mit­ted the of­fences with his mo­bile phone.</p>
    <p>The 24-year-old Sin­ga­porean, whose case was heard in a district court last Wed­nes­day, is fac­ing one charge of in­sult­ing a woman’s mod­esty and another charge un­der the Films Act for al­legedly be­ing in pos­ses­sion of 37 ob­scene videos.</p>
    <p>The videos were said to have been found on him at around 9pm on Sept 4 last year when he was at Sengkang MRT sta­tion.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment to The Straits Times yes­ter­day, SMU con­firmed he is still a stu­dent there.</p>
    <p>A spokesman said: “The univer­sity takes a strong stand against any form of mis­con­duct. Stu­dents who breach SMU’s code of stu­dent con­duct face a range of sanc­tions, in­clud­ing sus­pen­sion and ex­pul­sion.</p>
    <p>“As the case is cur­rently be­fore the courts, it would not be ap­pro­pri­ate for SMU to com­ment fur­ther.”</p>
    <p>Tien is the lat­est male ter­tiary stu­dent to be hauled to court for sim­i­lar of­fences.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, former Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity (NTU) stu­dent Han Shiyu, 18, was sen­tenced to a short de­ten­tion or­der of two weeks for tres­pass­ing into a fe­male toi­let at a res­i­den­tial hall to film a stu­dent who was in the shower.</p>
    <p>Those given a short de­ten­tion or­der are put be­hind bars for a short time, but will not have a crim­i­nal record af­ter their re­lease.</p>
    <p>NTU ex­pelled the Chi­nese na­tional soon af­ter he com­mit­ted the of­fence in Au­gust last year.</p>
    <p>Last month, Na­tional Univer­sity of Singapore stu­dent Joel Ra­sis Is­mail, 27, pleaded guilty to three charges of in­sult­ing a woman’s mod­esty and one of crim­i­nal tres­pass.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean had ad­mit­ted to tak­ing voyeuris­tic videos, in­clud­ing those of women in the shower on cam­pus last year.</p>
    <p>Joel is ex­pected to be sen­tenced to­day.</p>
    <p>Tien’s case has been ad­journed to Nov 5.</p>
    <p>For each count of in­sult­ing a woman’s mod­esty, an of­fender can be jailed for up to a year and fined.</p>
