    <p>For the first time in nine years, house­wife Yvonne Park will be re­lax­ing over chuseok, or the Korean Thanks­giv­ing Day, in­stead of toil­ing over the sink “wash­ing a moun­tain of dishes the size of Mount Ever­est”.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing dishes and pre­par­ing food is the re­spon­si­bil­ity of first daugh­ters-in-law like her, when the ex­tended fam­ily gath­ers ev­ery au­tumn to pray to an­ces­tors and catch up over a feast of tra­di­tional fare such as jeon (Korean pan­cakes) and song­pyeon (cres­centshaped rice cake).</p>
    <p>The an­nual fes­ti­val in South Korea, which falls on Oct 1 this year, is known to be im­mensely stress­ful for mar­ried women who have to slog for hours in the kitchen, while young peo­ple dread nosy rel­a­tives try­ing to pry into their per­sonal lives.</p>
    <p>But this year, with the Covid-19 pan­demic and so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules still in place, Mrs Park, 31, said her hus­band has de­cided against vis­it­ing his fam­ily with their three chil­dren, aged three to nine.</p>
    <p>Do­ing so would have meant a three- to five-hour drive on con­gested roads from their home in Pyeong­taek city, 65km south of Seoul, to the in-laws’ house 90km away in Non­san city, with a rest stop along the high­way that will prob­a­bly be crowded with other trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>“We won’t know who has the virus so it’s best to avoid the risk,” she told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“We will just stay at home this chuseok as most shops are closed. But thanks to the coro­n­avirus, I’m very happy that I fi­nally don’t have to wash a moun­tain of dishes any­more.”</p>
    <p>But mil­lions of peo­ple – out of a pop­u­la­tion of 51 mil­lion – are still ex­pected to be on the move next week, even though the gov­ern­ment has urged peo­ple to stay at home and will not waive high­way tolls like in pre­vi­ous years in a bid to dis­cour­age trav­el­ling.</p>
    <p>Some have opted for a do­mes­tic va­ca­tion in­stead, with south­ern Jeju is­land slated to re­ceive at least 200,000 vis­i­tors over the Sept 30-Oct 2 hol­i­day which stretches into the week­end, which means a five-day break.</p>
    <p>Gang­won, the eastern prov­ince, is also ex­pected to be brim­ming with lo­cal tourists.</p>
    <p>The Trans­port Min­istry has es­ti­mated that the num­ber of chuseok trav­ellers will de­cline by 30 per cent this year, with some 6.18 mil­lion peo­ple to be on the move on Oct 1 alone. Over 90 per cent are ex­pected to drive, so roads will be con­gested.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials have warned of an­other wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions af­ter chuseok, not­ing that asymp­to­matic cases still linger in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>South Korea reported 61 new cases yes­ter­day, the low­est since Aug 14 when the daily num­ber spiked above 100 due to a new wave of clus­ters. The coun­try’s to­tal tally stood at 23,106 cases, in­clud­ing 388 deaths.</p>
    <p>A two-week spe­cial virus pre­ven­tion scheme will kick in from Sun­day, in a bid to curb the po­ten­tial spread of Covid-19 over the fes­tive pe­riod.</p>
    <p>De­tails will be re­vealed later this week, but the scheme is ex­pected to in­clude beefed-up anti-virus mea­sures at pop­u­lar tourist spots.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, the gov­ern­ment an­nounced that all 11 na­tional ceme­ter­ies across the coun­try will be closed from Sept 30 to Oct 4.</p>
    <p>On­line wor­ship ser­vices will be pro­vided in­stead for peo­ple wish­ing to pay re­spects to their an­ces­tors.</p>
    <p>Some pro­vin­cial gov­ern­ments have em­barked on cam­paigns urg­ing res­i­dents to tell their chil­dren to stay away and not go vis­it­ing this chuseok.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, Wando county in South Je­olla prov­ince launched a pro­gramme to help el­derly res­i­dents make video calls to their chil­dren, while Uiseong county in North Gyeongsang prov­ince an­nounced plans to help se­niors record video mes­sages for their chil­dren.</p>
    <p>For some fam­i­lies though, gath­er­ing over chuseok is still a must.</p>
    <p>Music teacher Oh Ju-hee, 36, who lives in Seoul, said she will be vis­it­ing her par­ents and in­laws, who both live near her, next week.</p>
    <p>The main gath­er­ing at her in­laws’ house will in­volve 16 peo­ple from four fam­i­lies, she told The Straits Times.</p>
