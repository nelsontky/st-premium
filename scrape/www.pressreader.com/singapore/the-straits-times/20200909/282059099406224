    <p>Sengkang Town Coun­cil has ap­pointed an in­de­pen­dent panel to han­dle all mat­ters re­lated to the pend­ing ap­peals against a High Court judg­ment in­volv­ing Pasir Ris-Pung­gol Town Coun­cil (PRPTC).</p>
    <p>The panel, for­mally ap­pointed last Satur­day, con­sists of Se­nior Coun­sels Ken­neth Tan and Lok Vi Ming, as well as Ad­junct Pro­fes­sor Kevin Tan of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s law fac­ulty.</p>
    <p>The move comes be­fore the im­pend­ing trans­fer of all as­sets and li­a­bil­i­ties re­lat­ing to the area of Pasir Ris-Pung­gol GRC that now forms part of Sengkang GRC to the new Work­ers’ Party-run Sengkang Town Coun­cil (SKTC).</p>
    <p>“The ap­point­ment of the in­de­pen­dent panel is in fur­ther­ance of the SKTC’s pre­vi­ous pub­lic state­ment that it is fully com­mit­ted to en­sur­ing that all de­ci­sions taken in re­la­tion to the man­age­ment of the ap­peals are fair, trans­par­ent and in ac­cor­dance with the law,” said SKTC in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>PRPTC had ear­lier filed the civil suit to re­cover losses al­legedly in­curred by the for­mer Pung­gol East SMC un­der the Work­ers’ Party from 2013 to 2015.</p>
    <p>The for­mer sin­gle-mem­ber con­stituency is now part of Sengkang GRC, and re­turned to the Work­ers’ Party at the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion. This means SKTC has taken over the man­age­ment of the law­suit to be heard by the Court of Ap­peal later this month.</p>
    <p>The in­de­pen­dent panel, which has agreed not to charge a fee, will “at all times act in­de­pen­dently and im­par­tially in the best in­ter­ests of SKTC”, said the town coun­cil in its state­ment.</p>
    <p>The panel’s terms of ref­er­ence state that all three are ap­pointed in their per­sonal ca­pac­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“The fact that other per­sons in their or­gan­i­sa­tions have been or may be en­gaged by or have any deal­ing with SKTC, in­clud­ing on mat­ters po­ten­tially rel­e­vant to the work of the in­de­pen­dent panel, would not of it­self give rise to a jus­ti­fi­able doubt as to the in­de­pen­dence of the mem­bers,” the terms of ref­er­ence add.</p>
    <p>The panel will re­view pre­vi­ous in­struc­tions and ad­vice to PRPTC’s lawyers and de­cide what po­si­tion to take in re­la­tion to the ap­peals.</p>
    <p>Although they will not be paid a salary, the panel mem­bers will be re­im­bursed by SKTC for ex­penses they may in­cur in the course of their work, in­clud­ing, for in­stance, en­gag­ing le­gal ad­vis­ers or a sec­re­tary.</p>
    <p>The panel will pro­vide up­dates to SKTC on the progress of its work and the ex­er­cise of its pow­ers, and make de­ci­sions by a ma­jor­ity vote of its mem­bers.</p>
