    </section>

    <p>Over the course of my tech­nol­ogy and bank­ing ca­reer, I have closely ob­served how banks have re­sponded to the chang­ing na­ture of fi­nan­cial ser­vices in an in­creas­ingly in­ter­con­nected world, made pos­si­ble by ex­po­nen­tial tech ad­vance­ments.</p>
    <p>The last two decades – and par­tic­u­larly this past year – have brought about a mas­sive trans­for­ma­tion, moving both banks and cus­tomers from off­line to on­line.</p>
    <p>At the same time, phe­nom­e­nal growth in the tech sec­tor has fu­elled the emer­gence of start-ups promis­ing al­ter­na­tive so­lu­tions to bank­ing needs, threat­en­ing to dis­rupt a space tra­di­tion­ally oc­cu­pied by in­cum­bents.</p>
    <p>It has also been in­struc­tive to see how the banks have em­braced this par­a­digm shift by rein­vent­ing, re­defin­ing and reimag­in­ing bank­ing while re­main­ing trusted, safe and de­pend­able.</p>
    <p>The need for fi­nan­cial ser­vices, how­ever, re­mains un­changed.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers es­sen­tially want to trans­act, save, bor­row, pro­tect or in­vest, and bank­ing caters to these by pro­vid­ing pay­ment ser­vices, sav­ings plans, loans, in­sur­ance, fi­nan­cial plan­ning, wealth man­age­ment ad­vi­sory and ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Yet, how bank­ing is con­ducted has vastly changed. Cus­tomers de­mand in­stant grat­i­fi­ca­tion, fast is­sue res­o­lu­tion, with rel­e­vant hy­per-per­son­alised in­sights, so­lu­tions and ser­vices em­bed­ded in their daily ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers es­sen­tially want to do more with less, be it time or money; they are on the move and ex­pect their bank to be con­tex­tu­ally present yet in­vis­i­ble.</p>
    <p>ECOSYS­TEM PART­NER­SHIPS</p>
    <p>The in­dus­try can de­liver this by em­brac­ing open ecosys­tems.</p>
    <p>In na­ture, open ecosys­tems ex­change both en­ergy and mat­ter sym­bi­ot­i­cally with their sur­round­ing en­vi­ron­ments – the greater its di­ver­sity, the higher its re­silience and abil­ity to sup­port more or­gan­isms.</p>
    <p>Its bank­ing world coun­ter­part op­er­ates in a sim­i­lar man­ner. The ecosys­tem cre­ates a sym­bi­otic re­la­tion­ship be­tween a bank and an ecosys­tem part­ner from a non-bank in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Such a tie-up ac­cords mu­tual ben­e­fits to both par­ties to lever­age as­sets such as tech­nol­ogy, de­sign and data (with cus­tomers’ con­sent), mak­ing the bank­ing ex­pe­ri­ence more seam­less, more rel­e­vant and, ul­ti­mately, more use­ful for cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Open ecosys­tems, fa­cil­i­tated via ap­pli­ca­tion pro­gram­ming in­ter­faces (APIs) or oth­er­wise, hold the po­ten­tial to re­de­fine bank­ing and open new doors for the ben­e­fit of both cus­tomers and the in­dus­try alike.</p>
    <p>In 2017, DBS Bank launched the world’s largest API de­vel­oper plat­form in the in­dus­try, with 155 APIs.</p>
    <p>It was based on the “bank­ing as a ser­vice” model, which aims to in­te­grate as many ser­vice providers as needed to com­plete a fi­nan­cial ser­vice in an ef­fec­tive and timely man­ner. To­day, the plat­form boasts over 1,000 pub­lished APIs.</p>
    <p>This same process of shar­ing and ex­change can be ap­plied across the in­dus­try via the open bank­ing con­cept, where we are see­ing some ex­cit­ing developmen­ts.</p>
    <p>Open bank­ing is premised on the idea that the shar­ing of cus­tomer data across fi­nan­cial play­ers sparks greater com­pe­ti­tion and in­no­va­tion and, ul­ti­mately, de­liv­ers bet­ter out­comes for cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>By ag­gre­gat­ing cus­tomers’ fi­nan­cial in­for­ma­tion from var­i­ous play­ers in one place, both cus­tomers and fi­nan­cial providers alike stand to gain a more holis­tic view and, thus, clearer in­sights on how best cus­tomers should be served.</p>
    <p>The con­cept first emerged in Europe and has, over the years, found its foot­ing in many other ju­ris­dic­tions around the world, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore be­gan en­cour­ag­ing and gear­ing banks to move in this di­rec­tion since as early as 2016.</p>
    <p>DBS launched the dig­i­tal fi­nan­cial plan­ning tool NAV Plan­ner with this prin­ci­ple in mind as well.</p>
    <p>The on­line and mo­bile-based tool, which is also open to cus­tomers of other banks, can put to­gether a per­sonal bal­ance sheet for the user, iden­tify pro­tec­tion gaps, and pro­ject his fu­ture cash flow, among other fea­tures. As more data gets shared with the tool, the in­sights get more per­son­alised.</p>
    <p>We are on the cusp of a “post-dig­i­tal” era where dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion alone is not a dif­fer­en­tia­tor. Rather, dif­fer­en­ti­a­tion will stem from the abil­ity to ap­ply dig­i­tal in pow­er­ful new ways.</p>
    <p>There has never been a more ex­cit­ing time for us all. Wel­come to a fu­ture where banks can be in­vis­i­ble and ev­ery­where, an­tic­i­pat­ing needs and pro­vid­ing so­lu­tions with­out be­ing in­tru­sive. the fu­ture of bank­ing.</p>
