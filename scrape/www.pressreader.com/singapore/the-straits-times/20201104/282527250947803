    <p>Le­ices­ter man­ager Bren­dan Rodgers has sug­gested he will not get the credit he de­serves for mas­ter­mind­ing his team’s 4-1 vic­tory over Leeds on Mon­day be­cause of his na­tion­al­ity.</p>
    <p>Youri Tiele­mans struck twice, with J amie Vardy and Har­vey Barnes also get­ting on the score­sheet as the Foxes crushed Marcelo Bielsa’s side to move up to sec­ond in the Pre­mier League with 15 points, one point be­hind cham­pi­ons Liver­pool.</p>
    <p>It was Le­ices­ter’s fourth away vic­tory of the sea­son, fol­low­ing wins over West Bromwich Al­bion, Manch­ester City and Arse­nal, but Rodgers feels he is not treated with the same kind of re­spect as his for­eign coun­ter­parts.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause I’m a Bri­tish man­ager, we prob­a­bly got lucky,” Rodgers told re­porters. “That is the way it works for Bri­tish man­agers i n these games. But the players were tac­ti­cally very good and got their re­wards.</p>
    <p>“It’s the type of per­for­mance you need to win these games. You have to de­fend well but you know there is space.</p>
    <p>“On the back of Euro­pean travel, it was a per­for­mance that was very pleas­ing.”</p>
    <p>Rodgers, whose team won 2-1 at AEK Athens in the Europa League on Thurs­day, also hailed his back­line, which fea­tured two 19-yearolds – Wesley Fo­fana and Luke Thomas – and James Justin, 22, fol­low­ing long-term in­juries to key players like Wil­fred Ndidi, Caglar Soyuncu and Ri­cardo Pereira.</p>
    <p>“We’re ma­tur­ing all the time as a team and that’s pleas­ing to see,” he said.</p>
    <p>The form of Vardy has also given en­cour­age­ment that Le­ices­ter can again fight for a top-four place. He has now been di­rectly in­volved in 13 goals in his past 12 league games and with seven strikes this cam­paign, the 33-year-old is showing no signs of slow­ing down.</p>
    <p>For­mer City de­fender and pun­dit Micah Richards told BBC Ra­dio 5 Live “de­fend­ers don’t know how to play against him”, such is his move­ment in and around the box.</p>
    <p>Rodgers’ men lost out on a Cham­pi­ons League spot on the fi­nal day of last sea­son to Manch­ester United and while they faded badly in the sec­ond half of last term, they made some shrewd ac­qui­si­tions in sum­mer, giv­ing them more squad depth this time round.</p>
    <p>One of those ar­rivals is Fo­fana, who moved for £36 mil­lion (S$63.7 mil­lion) from Ligue 1 side Saint-Eti­enne and his as­sured dis­plays have not gone un­no­ticed.</p>
    <p>For­mer Celtic striker and pun­dit Chris Sut­ton said: “What an im­pact he has made. How good is Fo­fana go­ing to be, if he is this good now?”</p>
    <p>With Le­ices­ter mak­ing their joint-best start to a top-flight cam­paign, match­ing the 2000-01 sea­son, and win­ning their open­ing four away games for the first time, he also be­lieves their fans can even dream of another ti­tle, just like their maiden 2016 tri­umph.</p>
    <p>“Can they? They can, they did. Peo­ple are say­ing, ‘Can they win the Pre­mier League ti­tle again’?” Sut­ton said. “Bren­dan’s team have been dev­as­tat­ing. It’s another state­ment and a ‘watch out for us’.”</p>
    <p>Rodgers, how­ever, played down any talk of the ti­tle, say­ing: “It’s so early that it’s not re­ally worth talk­ing about.”</p>
