    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>You are bust­ing out with new ideas and schemes – so take notes. It may be a bet­ter time to plan than to take ac­tion, but if some­thing is su­per hot, you might as well go for it.</p>
    <p>Tau­rus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>You have to step back from for­mal agree­ments – un­less they are a mat­ter of life or death. It is not that you are mak­ing a mis­take, just that you can­not be sure the de­tails are in your favour.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Your brain is fired up and ready to go – so make the most of it and en­joy the re­sults. In­tel­lec­tu­al­is­ing of all kinds is eas­ier and more fun than usual, so think about deep is­sues and prob­lems.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>You feel some­what over­whelmed – there is way too much go­ing on in your life for you to take it all in. That is not to say that you should give up, though. Pri­ori­tise and you should be fine.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>You have a unique way of think­ing and the day puts it in stark con­trast to the more se­date frame of mind of those around you. Bust out with great ideas and show the world what you have.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>You need to be more care­ful – things are a bit more pre­car­i­ous than usual, es­pe­cially when it comes to com­mu­ni­ca­tion. Choose your words de­lib­er­ately.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>You have lots of things go­ing on and that is per­fect for you. In fact, you may scoop up a few new meet­ings or fun things to add to the mix. You have en­ergy for all of it.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>You are think­ing about tak­ing a gam­ble on a move or a re­la­tion­ship – or maybe some­thing smaller and more per­sonal. It is not likely to pay off at this time, so back away a bit.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>You are prac­ti­cally in­ca­pable of ex­pe­ri­enc­ing bore­dom on a day like today, so keep mov­ing and have fun with what­ever comes your way. Spend time with friends.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>You need to clear your head some­what – so take a walk, med­i­tate or do what­ever it takes to find your cen­tre once again. When you are there, the day’s prob­lems should seem silly.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Your love life takes off in a big way – though that could mean dif­fer­ent things. Maybe a crush makes your heart go boom or maybe your part­ner sur­prises you with some­thing amaz­ing.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>If some­one is push­ing you to make up your mind or tell your story in greater de­tail, push back for more time. You are not feel­ing de­tail-ori­ented and would rather get it right than get it on time.</p>
