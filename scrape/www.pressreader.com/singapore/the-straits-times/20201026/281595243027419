    <p>An internatio­nal treaty ban­ning nu­clear weapons has been rat­i­fied by a 50th coun­try, a United Na­tions of­fi­cial said, al­low­ing the text, which pro­po­nents call his­toric, to en­ter into force af­ter 90 days. Hon­duras be­came the 50th coun­try to rat­ify the treaty.</p>
    <p>UNITED STATES • An internatio­nal treaty ban­ning nu­clear weapons has been rat­i­fied by a 50th coun­try, a United Na­tions of­fi­cial said, al­low­ing the text pro­po­nents call his­toric to en­ter into force af­ter 90 days.</p>
    <p>While nu­clear-armed pow­ers have not signed up to the treaty, ac­tivists who have pushed for its en­act­ment hold out hope that it will none­the­less prove to be more than sym­bolic and have a grad­ual de­ter­rent ef­fect.</p>
    <p>Hon­duras be­came the 50th coun­try to rat­ify the treaty.</p>
    <p>“To­day is a vic­tory for hu­man­ity, and a prom­ise of a safer fu­ture,” Mr Peter Mau­rer, pres­i­dent of the Internatio­nal Com­mit­tee of the Red Cross (ICRC), said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Other non-govern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions also wel­comed the news, in­clud­ing the Internatio­nal Cam­paign to Abol­ish Nu­clear Weapons, a coali­tion that won the 2017 No­bel Peace Prize for its key role in bring­ing the treaty to fruition. “Hon­duras just rat­i­fied the Treaty as the 50th state, trig­ger­ing en­try into force and mak­ing his­tory,” Ican said in a tweet.</p>
    <p>The 75th an­niver­sary of the nu­clear bomb at­tacks on Na­gasaki and Hiroshima, marked in Au­gust, saw a wave of coun­tries rat­ify the treaty in re­cent months. They have in­cluded Nigeria, Malaysia, Ire­land, Malta and Tu­valu. Thai­land, Mex­ico, South Africa, Bangladesh, New Zealand, Viet­nam and the Vat­i­can are among the coun­tries that had al­ready rat­i­fied it. It is now ex­pected to en­ter into force in Jan­uary 2021.</p>
    <p>The Treaty on the Pro­hi­bi­tion of Nu­clear Weapons – which bans the use, de­vel­op­ment, pro­duc­tion, test­ing, sta­tion­ing, stock­pil­ing and threat of use of such weapons – was adopted by the UN Gen­eral As­sem­bly in July 2017 with the ap­proval of 122 coun­tries. Eighty-four states have since signed it, though not all have rat­i­fied the text.</p>
    <p>The clutch of nu­clear-armed states, in­clud­ing the United States, Bri­tain, France, China and Rus­sia, have not signed the treaty. How­ever, cam­paign­ers hope that it com­ing into force will have the same im­pact as pre­vi­ous internatio­nal treaties on land­mines and clus­ter mu­ni­tions, bring­ing a stigma to their stock­pil­ing and use, and thereby a change in be­hav­iour even in coun­tries that did not sign up.</p>
    <p>Ican said in a state­ment that “we can ex­pect com­pa­nies to stop pro­duc­ing nu­clear weapons and fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to stop in­vest­ing in nu­clear weapon pro­duc­ing com­pa­nies.” The coali­tion’s ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Beatrice Fihn called it “a new chap­ter for nu­clear dis­ar­ma­ment”, adding that “decades of ac­tivism have achieved what many said was im­pos­si­ble: Nu­clear weapons are banned”.</p>
    <p>Nu­clear-armed states ar­gue their ar­se­nals serve as a de­ter­rent and say they re­main com­mit­ted to the nu­clear Non-Pro­lif­er­a­tion Treaty, which seeks to pre­vent the spread of nu­clear weapons.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Rus­sia and the United States have been seek­ing to break an im­passe in long-run­ning talks aimed at ex­tend­ing a nu­clear arms deal between them. The two sides have strug­gled to find com­mon ground over the fate of the New Start treaty, which lim­its both sides to 1,550 de­ployed war­heads but is due to ex­pire next Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>While the US wants to re­work the deal to in­clude China and cover new kinds of weapons, Rus­sia is will­ing to ex­tend the pact for five years with­out any new con­di­tions – and each side has re­peat­edly shot down the other’s pro­pos­als.</p>
    <p>The agree­ment was signed in 2010 at the peak of hopes for a “re­set” in re­la­tions between the two coun­tries. To­gether with the Cold War-era In­ter­me­di­ate-Range Nu­clear Forces (INF) treaty, it was con­sid­ered a cen­tre­piece of internatio­nal arms con­trol.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the United States with­drew from the INF last year af­ter ac­cus­ing Moscow of vi­o­la­tions.</p>
