    <p>WASH­ING­TON • In­censed by a Supreme Court rul­ing that fur­ther dashed Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s hopes of in­val­i­dat­ing his Novem­ber elec­toral de­feat, thou­sands of his sup­port­ers marched in Wash­ing­ton and sev­eral state cap­i­tals to protest against what they con­tended, against all ev­i­dence, was a stolen elec­tion.</p>
    <p>In some places, an­gry con­fronta­tions be­tween pro­test­ers and counter-pro­test­ers over the week­end es­ca­lated into vi­o­lence. There were a num­ber of scuf­fles in the na­tional cap­i­tal, and the po­lice de­clared a riot in Olympia, Wash­ing­ton, where one per­son was shot.</p>
    <p>Po­lice moved in to sep­a­rate du­elling pro­test­ers, us­ing pep­per spray on mem­bers of both sides.</p>
    <p>The court’s ac­tion clears the way for the Elec­toral Col­lege to meet in 50 states and the Dis­trict of Columbia to­day, leav­ing no fur­ther path for Mr Trump to chal­lenge the elec­tion out­come. The Elec­toral Col­lege is set to af­firm Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s vic­tory.</p>
    <p>In videos of a clash in Olympia that were posted on so­cial me­dia, a sin­gle gun­shot can be heard as black-clad counter-pro­test­ers move to­wards mem­bers of the pro-Trump group, in­clud­ing one per­son wav­ing a large Trump flag.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the gun­shot, one of the counter-pro­test­ers is seen fall­ing to the ground, and oth­ers call for help. In one video, a man with a gun can be seen run­ning from the scene and don­ning a red hat.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton State Pa­trol spokesman Chris Loftis said one per­son was in cus­tody in connection with the episode, but that de­tails about the shoot­ing were not yet clear, in­clud­ing the con­di­tion of the per­son who was shot.</p>
    <p>Af­ter dark fell on Satur­day, the pro­test­ers – in­clud­ing mem­bers of the ag­gres­sive far-left anti-facism move­ment – splin­tered into smaller groups to roam the streets in search of their ri­vals.</p>
    <p>State and fed­eral courts have re­jected dozens of law­suits by Mr Trump’s al­lies seek­ing to chal­lenge the elec­tion re­sults, but the pointed re­fusal by the Supreme Court last Fri­day to hear a case filed by the at­tor­ney-gen­eral of Texas loomed the largest yet.</p>
    <p>By fore­clos­ing one of the last le­gal av­enues Mr Trump had to po­ten­tially block Mr Bi­den from suc­ceed­ing him on Jan 20, it left many of his par­ti­sans cast­ing an­grily about for an­swers.</p>
    <p>Trump flags dot­ted the air above Free­dom Plaza in Wash­ing­ton, where demon­stra­tors – in­clud­ing many mem­bers of the far-right Proud Boys group – chanted “four more years!” and vowed not to recog­nise Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump flew over the pro­test­ers in Ma­rine One on his way to at­tend the Army-Navy foot­ball game at West Point. Pro­test­ers erupted in cheers as the he­li­copter and its es­cort passed over­head.</p>
    <p>“Wow! Thou­sands of peo­ple form­ing in Wash­ing­ton (D.C.) for Stop the Steal. Didn’t know about this, but I’ll be see­ing them! #MAGA,” the Pres­i­dent tweeted.</p>
    <p>At Ge­or­gia’s State­house in At­lanta, speak­ers used mega­phones to cast doubt on the elec­tion as US flags and Make Amer­ica Great Again hats bobbed in the crowd.</p>
    <p>Across the street, a few dozen anti-Trump ac­tivists – many dressed all in black – heck­led the Pres­i­dent’s sup­port­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Chris Hill, the leader of a right-wing group called the Ge­or­gia Se­cu­rity Force III per cent, had ral­lied many of the pro­test­ers to the State­house. He said the Supreme Court had “thumbed its nose at us”.</p>
    <p>But un­like many oth­ers in at­ten­dance, he said he ac­cepted that Mr Trump had lost the elec­tion. “At this point, this thing is over.”</p>
    <p>Some demon­stra­tors were more con­fi­dent than oth­ers about how Mr Trump could se­cure a sec­ond term de­spite los­ing the vote.</p>
    <p>Ms Phyl­lis Mon­son, 61, who drove for sev­eral days from Tonopah, Ari­zona, to at­tend the rally, said she was not sure what steps re­mained avail­able to over­turn the elec­tion’s re­sult, but that she was con­vinced it had been un­fair. “This elec­tion was such a fraud,” she said. “There needs to be a revote.”</p>
