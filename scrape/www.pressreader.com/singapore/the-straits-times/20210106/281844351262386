    <p>SEOUL • The num­ber of deaths linked to the coro­n­avirus in South Korea has passed 1,000, while an in­creas­ing num­ber of gym own­ers said they would re­open in protest against strict so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules.</p>
    <p>Af­ter us­ing ag­gres­sive test­ing and trac­ing to blunt sev­eral ear­lier waves of the coro­n­avirus with­out wide­spread lock­downs, South Korea has im­posed in­creas­ingly stri­dent so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules as it strug­gles to stop its largest wave yet.</p>
    <p>The Korea Disease Con­trol and Preven­tion Agency (KDCA) re­ported 28 new deaths and 715 new cases, for a to­tal of 1,007 deaths and 64,979 cases over­all yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in told a Cab­i­net meet­ing that the coun­try’s top goal was to make it out of the “long tun­nel of coro­n­avirus” and said the daily num­bers ap­peared to have peaked thanks to res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>“This year, we will surely over­come the Covid-19 quickly to re­cover the ev­ery­day lives the peo­ple have lost,” he said.</p>
    <p>For weeks, gyms have been</p>
    <p>among the venues forced to close un­der the rules, although taek­wondo and bal­let classes have been al­lowed to con­tinue un­der cer­tain lim­its. That is an un­fair dou­ble stan­dard, and is hit­ting gyms</p>
    <p>right when they usu­ally sign up the most new cus­tomers, said Mr Kim Jae-kang, who said he planned to soon re­open his fit­ness and pilates cen­tre in Seoul.</p>
    <p>Op­er­a­tors and pa­trons who flout the rules can face up to 3 mil­lion won (S$3,635) in fines.</p>
    <p>“For the fit­ness in­dus­try, Jan­uary is the peak sea­son to draw gym mem­bers, who de­cide to start work­ing out from the new year,” Mr Kim said.</p>
    <p>So­cial dis­tanc­ing works bet­ter in gyms than in restau­rants, said Mr Oh Sung-young, head of South Korea’s gym own­ers as­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“Those who come to work out ac­tu­ally do care about their health, so they never take their masks off,” said Mr Oh, who es­ti­mated that his was among as many as 300 gyms that have or planned to re­open, with many others hold­ing se­cret train­ing for cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has said it is avoid­ing i mpos­ing the high­est level of lock­down, which would im­pose a blan­ket ban on restau­rants and other busi­nesses that can cur­rently still op­er­ate with some re­stric­tions, in or­der to avoid eco­nomic dam­age. Of­fi­cials have blamed busi­nesses that flout so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules for help­ing to fuel the wave.</p>
    <p>KDCA di­rec­tor Jeong Eunkyeong said on Mon­day that the au­thor­i­ties are aware of the is­sue of fair­ness in the case of gyms but said the ban had been based on the difficulty of wear­ing masks dur­ing work­outs. She said the au­thor­i­ties were in talks to re­vise the guide­lines and make the so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules more sus­tain­able.</p>
