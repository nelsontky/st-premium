    <p>Malaysian Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s al­liance has won the Sabah state elec­tions, boost­ing his cre­den­tials amid a lead­er­ship chal­lenge from fed­eral op­po­si­tion chief An­war Ibrahim.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cial re­sults, Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s Gabun­gan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) al­liance yes­ter­day won 38 state assem­bly seats – just one seat above the min­i­mum 37 re­quired to form the next state gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Ri­val Parti Warisan Sabah and its al­lies, which formed the in­cum­bent gov­ern­ment, won 32 seats. In­de­pen­dent can­di­dates won the re­main­ing three seats. The state has a to­tal of 73 con­stituen­cies.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din has said that snap na­tional polls could be called soon if GRS were to win in Sabah.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s gen­eral elec­tion is due only in 2023, but has been widely spec­u­lated to be called within the next few months.</p>
    <p>The Sabah vic­tory would help strengthen Mr Muhyid­din’s bid in de­fend­ing his pre­mier­ship against Datuk Seri An­war, who said last week that he has the num­bers to form the next fed­eral gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war last Wed­nes­day dropped a bomb­shell by say­ing that he has ma­jor­ity sup­port from fed­eral MPs and claimed that the Muhyid­din gov­ern­ment, which came to power seven months ago, has “col­lapsed”.</p>
    <p>A loss in Sabah could have led to po­lit­i­cal tur­moil at the fed­eral level as PM Muhyid­din’s crit­ics could ques­tion his po­lit­i­cal strength.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din, in a state­ment on Face­book, said the vic­tory showed that vot­ers trusted GRS, and asked his al­liance to ful­fil its prom­ises.</p>
    <p>“I con­grat­u­late GRS can­di­dates who won this elec­tion. It’s time for all of you to pour the best ser­vice to the peo­ple and prove that we truly care for the peo­ple,” he added.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Hamzah Zain­udin, sec­re­tary-gen­eral of Perikatan Na­sional (PN), Mr Muhyid­din’s rul­ing coali­tion, said hours be­fore the of­fi­cial re­sults were an­nounced that based on un­of­fi­cial fig­ures, GRS “will take over the state”.</p>
    <p>Sabah Barisan Na­sional (BN) chief Bung Mok­tar Radin too de­clared GRS vic­tors of the elec­tion late yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The vic­tory means that GRS – con­sist­ing of PN, BN, Parti Ber­satu Sabah (PBS) and sev­eral other Sabah-based par­ties – has snatched away the state gov­ern­ment from ri­val Warisan and its al­lies, which took over af­ter the 2018 Gen­eral Elec­tion. The vic­tory was more re­mark­able as mem­bers of GRS con­tested against one another in 17 of the 73 wards.</p>
    <p>Still, it re­mains un­clear who will be­come the chief min­is­ter. Both PN and BN had touted their own can­di­dates for the post dur­ing the 14-day cam­paign­ing.</p>
    <p>PN has named its Sabah chair­man, Datuk Ha­jiji Noor, as po­ten­tial chief min­is­ter, while BN has put for­ward the name of Bung Mok­tar, who is fac­ing cor­rup­tion charges.</p>
    <p>BN chief and Umno pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi has said that tra­di­tion­ally, the fac­tion with the big­gest num­ber of seats gets to choose who would be­come the state’s chief min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>PN won 17 of the 38 al­liance seats, and BN won 14. PBS won in seven wards. Voter turnout was just over 60 per cent of the nearly 1.1 mil­lion vot­ers in Malaysia’s sec­ond-big­gest state af­ter Sarawak.</p>
    <p>Con­cerns of a surge in Covid-19 cases in Sabah in re­cent weeks con­trib­uted to the lower turnout. In 2018, voter turnout was 77 per cent.</p>
    <p>Since drop­ping the mid-week bomb­shell that he had gar­nered enough sup­port to form a new gov­ern­ment, op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim has un­leashed a clutch of forces that have laid bare the brit­tle state of pol­i­tics in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>His lat­est and most au­da­cious make-or-break gam­bit for the pre­mier­ship has ex­posed Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s frag­ile hold on power and brought to the sur­face the bit­ter ri­val­ries within the rul­ing Perikatan Na­sional (PN) coali­tion, in par­tic­u­lar the sim­mer­ing strug­gles i n the l ong-es­tab­lished Umno. It is yet to be seen how the win in Sabah by Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s al­liance might change the po­lit­i­cal pic­ture.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri An­war’s own Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) coali­tion that he leads has not been spared.</p>
    <p>His bid for power has stoked un­ease among PH lead­ers – such as Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party (DAP) sec­re­tary-gen­eral Lim Guan Eng – over spec­u­la­tion that the new for­mula to wrest power in­cludes forg­ing al­liances with Umno fac­tions led by pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi and for­mer premier Na­jib Razak.</p>
    <p>Close aides to the 73-year-old Mr An­war, who spoke on con­di­tion of anonymity, were coy about the specifics of what they ac­knowl­edged would be his last bid for the pre­mier­ship, a po­si­tion that has eluded him since the late 1990s when he fell out with for­mer premier Ma­hathir Mo­hamad and served two long sep­a­rate jail sen­tences.</p>
    <p>“What An­war is propos­ing is quite rad­i­cal and it is un­der­stand­able that some (PH) lead­ers are up­set be­cause they do not have the full pic­ture,” said a long-time as­so­ci­ate who has been along­side Mr An­war since the 1980s.</p>
    <p>He added that the PH con­struct will be re­cal­i­brated to “make way for a new po­lit­i­cal struc­ture”.</p>
    <p>This vet­eran po­lit­i­cal op­er­a­tive de­clined to elab­o­rate, but other An­war sup­port­ers and other politi­cians fa­mil­iar with his plans said the new po­lit­i­cal struc­ture will deal di­rectly with con­cerns over Malay rep­re­sen­ta­tion in the gov­ern­ment that had plagued the PH ad­min­is­tra­tion be­fore it col­lapsed in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>That could prove par­tic­u­larly tricky in a coun­try where dis­putes over race and re­li­gion can break frag­ile po­lit­i­cal al­liances.</p>
    <p>Suc­cess for Mr An­war is far from as­sured and much will de­pend on how he en­gages with Malaysia’s King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ri’ay­atud­din, in the com­ing days.</p>
    <p>While the role of the King, who is picked from the coun­try’s nine royal house­holds ev­ery five years, is largely cer­e­mo­nial, the Con­sti­tu­tion dic­tates that Mr An­war must con­vince Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah that he has the ma­jor­ity sup­port of MPs in or­der to form the next gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The King could also up­set Mr An­war’s bid by dis­solv­ing Par­lia­ment and call­ing fresh elec­tions.</p>
    <p>But sev­eral po­lit­i­cal an­a­lysts noted that the prospect of fresh polls – which are be­ing strongly pro­moted by fac­tions within Umno and another PN com­po­nent, the right-wing Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia, or PAS – is un­likely at this point, largely ow­ing to the com­pli­ca­tions posed by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>While the odds ap­pear stacked against Mr An­war, his lat­est move has sent shock waves through the po­lit­i­cal land­scape. For starters, his dec­la­ra­tion of se­cur­ing a ma­jor­ity, to­gether with uniden­ti­fied elected rep­re­sen­ta­tives from Umno and other politi­cians from the East Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak, has ef­fec­tively cast doubts over the two-seat ma­jor­ity Mr Muhyid­din en­joys as premier.</p>
    <p>Umno con­trols the largest block in his PN coali­tion with 39 seats, and the de­par­ture of a hand­ful of MPs would mean the col­lapse of the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>In re­cent days, Mr Muhyid­din has come out to de­fend his po­si­tion, ar­gu­ing that the coun­try’s At­tor­ney</p>
    <p>Gen­eral had af­firmed that he was still the prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>But po­lit­i­cal an­a­lysts be­lieve that his days are num­bered af­ter Zahid said last week that his party would not stop law­mak­ers from back­ing Mr An­war, a move that was widely viewed as a blunt mes­sage to Mr Muhyid­din that fac­tions in Umno no longer sup­ported him.</p>
    <p>Zahid’s state­ment also drew crit­i­cism from other Umno lead­ers, who want to keep the tot­ter­ing Muhyid­din ad­min­is­tra­tion in power, and at the same time strained the party’s al­ready testy re­la­tions with PAS, which is de­mand­ing that the Umno pres­i­dent clar­ify his stand.</p>
    <p>Close aides of Mr An­war noted that the el­e­ment of panic in state­ments by PN lead­ers in re­cent days was be­cause of a grow­ing view among his po­lit­i­cal foes that he does have the num­ber to back his claim.</p>
    <p>“The Palace has in­formed us that un­less it was a min­i­mum of a 118-seat ma­jor­ity, it would not en­ter­tain any bid (for the change of gov­ern­ment),” said one An­war as­so­ci­ate di­rectly in­volved in the bid to wrest power. “An­war had a con­firmed meet­ing with the King who had al­ready re­ceived doc­u­ments sup­port­ing his claim.”</p>
    <p>But Mr An­war’s bid has other po­ten­tial hur­dles. Among them is se­cur­ing the buy-in from the Chi­nese-dom­i­nated DAP, which is the sin­gle largest com­po­nent in the PH coali­tion with 42 seats, over grow­ing spec­u­la­tion that Mr An­war’s at­tempt to wrest con­trol of gov­ern­ment is com­ing with back­ing from fac­tions aligned to Umno’s Zahid and Na­jib.</p>
    <p>“I want to stress to­day that DAP will not co­op­er­ate with an Umno that is un­der the lead­er­ship of Ah­mad Zahid and Na­jib Ab­dul Razak. Ab­so­lutely not,” DAP’s Lim said while cam­paign­ing in Sabah last week.</p>
