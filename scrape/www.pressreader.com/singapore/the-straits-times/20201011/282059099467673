    <p>If the elite are more fal­li­ble, it cre­ates an op­por­tu­nity. This could be a sea­son where 90 points are not needed to be­come cham­pi­ons. The last time that hap­pened, Le­ices­ter’s rank out­siders won. Like Ever­ton now, they were not in Europe.</p>
    <p>Ever­ton won their first seven games of the sea­son. The eighth was a Mersey­side derby. They won that, too, 3-0. It is not a pre­dic­tion of the im­me­di­ate fu­ture as much as an­cient history: This was 1894-95 when Ever­ton made what is their finest start to a cam­paign.</p>
    <p>History will not re­peat it­self in one re­spect – Liver­pool were rel­e­gated then – but, with ev­ery week, it feels like­lier it might in another. Ever­ton had enough stay­ing power in 1895 to fin­ish sec­ond.</p>
    <p>Fast for­ward to the small mat­ter of 125 years and Ever­ton pose a ques­tion: early sea­son anom­aly or the real deal?</p>
    <p>Satur­day’s Mersey­side derby may of­fer an an­swer. It also has the un­usual back­drop that, while Liver­pool lost 7-2 – a score­line seem­ingly plucked from 1895 – in their last game, Ever­ton have more to prove.</p>
    <p>They have not beaten their neigh­bours for 10 years.</p>
    <p>They have spe­cialised in flat­ter­ing to de­ceive in the last six years, a by­word for ex­pen­sive un­der­achieve­ment. Yet while they have had an in­fe­ri­or­ity com­plex against Liver­pool, they have al­ready passed one psy­cho­log­i­cal test: vic­tory at Tot­ten­ham in their English Premier League sea­son opener was their first win away at Big-Six op­po­nents since 2013.</p>
    <p>There are other rea­sons to won­der if this sea­son will be dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>Carlo Ancelotti’s pres­ence at Good­i­son Park re­mains in­trigu­ing, but it no longer looks as in­con­gru­ous when Ever­ton are gen­uinely good.</p>
    <p>The Ital­ian’s rep­u­ta­tion has been forged more in the Cham­pi­ons</p>
    <p>League but he has won do­mes­tic leagues in four dif­fer­ent coun­tries, even if all came with one of the pre-sea­son favourites.</p>
    <p>But it is also the wider con­text. The freak re­sults that have abounded of late sug­gest a wider un­pre­dictabil­ity.</p>
    <p>Lack­ing a proper pre-sea­son, some of the old cer­tain­ties have gone.</p>
    <p>If the elite are more fal­li­ble, it cre­ates an op­por­tu­nity. This could be a sea­son where 90 points are not needed to be­come cham­pi­ons. The last time that hap­pened, Le­ices­ter’s rank out­siders won. Like Ever­ton now, they were not in Europe.</p>
    <p>Now Liver­pool are one of seven sides who also have to cram six con­ti­nen­tal games into the next two months. Ever­ton don’t.</p>
    <p>They could have the con­ti­nu­ity and fresh­ness their ri­vals will lack. That may be as well: Ancelotti’s sum­mer busi­ness has given them a for­mi­da­ble start­ing XI but their bench is pop­u­lated in part by play­ers they were will­ing to sell.</p>
    <p>So it boils down to a core. James Ro­driguez has been a rev­e­la­tion but has not started 20 league games in a sea­son since 2014-15. Do­minic Calvert-Lewin has six league goals al­ready but has only once got more in a sea­son – 13 last term. Sea­mus Cole­man turns 32 to­day and is fight­ing the tides of time. Jor­dan Pick­ford’s mis­takes have not cost Ever­ton yet but they amount to a con­cern.</p>
    <p>Logic sug­gests they will slip away, but the same was said of Le­ices­ter.</p>
    <p>Ever­ton do not visit any of the usual sus­pects un­til Fe­bru­ary. There is the chance be­fore then to build mo­men­tum and a gap, to fash­ion some­thing re­mark­able. This is the strangest of sea­sons, so could it yet be the Tof­fees’ year?</p>
