    <p>LON­DON • Eng­land man­ager Gareth South­gate yes­ter­day picked de­fender Harry Maguire in his Na­tions League squad prior to the Manch­ester United cap­tain be­ing found guilty of ag­gra­vated as­sault, re­sist­ing ar­rest and re­peated bribery at­tempts on the Greek is­land of Mykonos yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The 27-year-old, rep­re­sented by his lawyers in court at a hear­ing, was con­victed of all the charges, ac­cord­ing to Sky News. He has pleaded not guilty and was re­leased from po­lice cus­tody last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>On Maguire, South­gate told a news con­fer­ence: “It is clearly a de­ci­sion that is not straight­for­ward and a de­ci­sion that I could only take on the in­for­ma­tion I have.</p>
    <p>“I have spo­ken to Harry, I have the in­sight to the story which is very dif­fer­ent to what is be­ing re­ported. Clearly if facts change or in­for­ma­tion changes, I have to review that de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>“Harry re­grets the fact he has brought that sort of fo­cus and at­ten­tion to the team – he apol­o­gised for that – but also has his own side of the story. I have a fan­tas­tic re­la­tion­ship with Harry... I have no rea­son to doubt what he is telling me.”</p>
    <p>Eng­land cap­tain and Tot­ten­ham striker Harry Kane will be avail­able for the Na­tions League matches against Ice­land (Sept 5 in Reyk­javik) and Den­mark (Sept 8 in Copen­hagen) de­spite be­ing in quar­an­tine fol­low­ing a trip to the Ba­hamas.</p>
    <p>So too will Ra­heem Ster­ling, with the Manch­ester City for­ward pass­ing a Covid-19 test af­ter he was at a birth­day party for Ja­maican sprint great Usain Bolt, who sub­se­quently was in­fected by the virus.</p>
    <p>Ster­ling, how­ever, will have to un­der­take an­other test in or­der to enter Eng­land’s bio­sphere “bub­ble”.</p>
    <p>United goal­keeper Dean Hen­der­son and striker Ma­son Green­wood, City mid­fielder Phil Foden and Leeds mid­fielder Kalvin Phillips, who was handed his first call-up, will all have a chance to make their in­ter­na­tional de­buts.</p>
    <p>The 24-year-old Phillips, who helped his side clinch the Cham­pi­onship ti­tle last sea­son and earn pro­mo­tion to the English top flight for the first time in 16 years, was over the moon with the recog­ni­tion.</p>
    <p>“It is mas­sive news for me, the club and my fam­ily. I am grate­ful for the op­por­tu­nity,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think I ex­pected to get into the Eng­land squad this early, maybe I got lucky, I don’t know. I’m ob­vi­ously a very happy per­son and to break the news to my fam­ily is very im­por­tant.”</p>
    <p>Mid­fielder Jack Grealish, who helped As­ton Villa re­tain their Premier League sta­tus last sea­son, how­ever, was a sur­prise ex­clu­sion, as was Tot­ten­ham’s Dele Alli.</p>
    <p>The Chelsea quar­tet of Ross Barkley, Ruben Lof­tus-Cheek, Reece James and Cal­lum Hud­sonO­doi also missed out.</p>
    <p>The Three Li­ons have not played since last Novem­ber due to the dis­rup­tion caused by Covid-19, which also forced Euro 2020 to be pushed back a year.</p>
