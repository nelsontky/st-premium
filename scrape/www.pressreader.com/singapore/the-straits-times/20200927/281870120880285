    <p>TUTZING (Ger­many) • Thai ac­tivists have planted a sym­bolic plaque declar­ing Thai­land be­longs to the peo­ple in front of King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn’s villa i n Ger­many, as protests call­ing for re­forms to his monar­chy grow at home.</p>
    <p>Amid pour­ing rain on Friday, protest or­gan­iser Junya Yimprasert from Ac­t4Dem read out a let­ter to the King call­ing for more democ­racy and said the Thai peo­ple did not want a King who spends most of the year in Ger­many.</p>
    <p>“We want the King to give up the throne, we want the King to stop ha­rass­ing the Thai peo­ple,” she said out­side the villa in Tutzing on Lake Starn­berg, a pop­u­lar play­ground for mil­lion­aires an hour’s drive south-west of Mu­nich.</p>
    <p>The Thai em­bassy in Ber­lin could not be reached for com­ment.</p>
    <p>The Royal Palace made no com­ment and has made no com­ment on the protests in Thai­land.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers chal­leng­ing Thai­land’s palace and army-dom­i­nated es­tab­lish­ment broke a l ong-stand­ing taboo by de­mand­ing re­form of the monar­chy in Au­gust and the call was taken up last week­end by tens of thou­sands of peo­ple at a demon­stra­tion in Bangkok.</p>
    <p>The #Repub­li­cofThai­land hash­tag trended in Thai­land on Friday af­ter Par­lia­ment de­layed ad­dress­ing pro­test­ers’ de­mand for con­sti­tu­tional change.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Thai Con­sti­tu­tion, the monar­chy must be held “in a po­si­tion of revered wor­ship”.</p>
    <p>The sym­bolic plaque planted in a flower pot in front of the Tutzing villa re­sem­bled one that pro­test­ers ce­mented near the Grand Palace in Bangkok last week­end and which pro­claims Thai­land be­longs to the peo­ple and not the monarch. Thai po­lice swiftly re­moved that plaque.</p>
    <p>King Va­ji­ra­longkorn, 68, has been Thai­land’s monarch since 2016, but spends much of his time in Bavaria, where his 15-year-old son is at school.</p>
    <p>His lifestyle has been fod­der for Ger­man tabloids, which pub­lished pic­tures of him wear­ing a crop top when he was Crown Prince.</p>
    <p>De­tails of the King’s life in Ger­many are not car­ried in main­stream me­dia in Thai­land, where lese ma­jeste laws set a jail sen­tence of up to 15 years for any­one in­sult­ing the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>Thai pro­test­ers have com­plained about the cost of the King’s stays in Europe as well as his ab­sence from the king­dom. The pro­test­ers in Thai­land are seek­ing to re­duce the King’s pow­ers un­der the Con­sti­tu­tion and also to re­move his di­rect con­trol of a royal fortune val­ued in tens of bil­lions of dol­lars, and some units of the army.</p>
    <p>CALL TO STEP DOWN</p>
    <p>We want the King to give up the throne, we want the King to stop ha­rass­ing the Thai ’’ peo­ple.</p>
    <p>PROTEST OR­GAN­ISER JUNYA YIMPRASERT, reading a let­ter to the King.</p>
