    <p>The lapses iden­ti­fied af­fected pa­tient safety, and in­cluded life-sav­ing equip­ment and med­i­ca­tion ei­ther not be­ing main­tained or not made avail­able in crit­i­cal ar­eas of the hos­pi­tal, such as the in­ten­sive care unit and the op­er­at­ing theatre. There was also a lack of qual­ity con­trol in the lab­o­ra­tory and in­fec­tion con­trol pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>Con­cord In­ter­na­tional Hos­pi­tal (CIH), which has been or­dered to sus­pend its med­i­cal ser­vices, may have its li­cence re­voked if it does not rec­tify “sig­nif­i­cant lapses” iden­ti­fied by the Min­istry of Health (MOH) by Jan 20.</p>
    <p>It found that the hos­pi­tal, which has ap­par­ently been sold, failed to abide by the Pri­vate Hos­pi­tals and Med­i­cal Clin­ics Act (PHMCA).</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to queries by The Straits Times, MOH said on Mon­day that it car­ried out in­spec­tions from Dec 14 to 16 last year, fol­low­ing changes to the hos­pi­tal’s man­age­ment team.</p>
    <p>The lapses iden­ti­fied af­fected pa­tient safety, and in­cluded life-sav­ing equip­ment and med­i­ca­tion ei­ther not be­ing main­tained or not made avail­able in crit­i­cal ar­eas of the hos­pi­tal, such as the in­ten­sive care unit and the op­er­at­ing theatre.</p>
    <p>There was also a lack of qual­ity con­trol in the lab­o­ra­tory and in­fec­tion con­trol pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>The hos­pi­tal was there­fore or­dered to tem­po­rar­ily stop the pro­vi­sion of health­care ser­vices with ef­fect from Dec 19.</p>
    <p>On Dec 28, nine days af­ter the hos­pi­tal’s sus­pen­sion, Nas­daq re­ported that Con­cord Med­i­cal had agreed to sell 90 per cent eq­uity in­ter­est in Con­cord Health­care Sin­ga­pore, which owned and op­er­ated the hos­pi­tal, for about $52.2 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The re­port added that the un­named pur­chasers had taken over the man­age­ment of the hos­pi­tal, which Con­cord Med­i­cal had ceased to con­trol since Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Con­cord Med­i­cal’s chair­man and chief ex­ec­u­tive, Dr Yang Jianyu, was quoted as say­ing: “Our di­vest­ment of CIH al­lows Con­cord Med­i­cal to fully con­cen­trate on our ef­forts to build com­pre­hen­sive can­cer hos­pi­tals in China.”</p>
    <p>MOH said on Mon­day that this was the first time that a pri­vate hos­pi­tal was or­dered to sus­pend all ser­vices and oper­a­tions due to fail­ures in com­pli­ance with the PHMCA.</p>
    <p>The min­istry noted that aside from a stop or­der, it could take a range of reg­u­la­tory en­force­ment ac­tions against li­censed health­care fa­cil­i­ties for lapses un­der the PHMCA, in­clud­ing warn­ings, fines and the re­vo­ca­tion of a li­cence.</p>
    <p>Fail­ure to com­ply with di­rec­tions is­sued by MOH could lead to a fine of up to $10,000. A fine of up to $1,000 for ev­ery day or part thereof will be im­posed if the trans­gres­sions con­tinue.</p>
    <p>Lo­cated in Adam Road, CIH was pre­vi­ously known as For­tis Sur­gi­cal Hos­pi­tal, a 31-bed pri­vate fa­cil­ity which was opened in July 2012 un­der For­tis Health­care In­ter­na­tional, a health­care de­liv­ery ser­vice provider in In­dia.</p>
    <p>It was sold to Con­cord Med­i­cal Ser­vices (In­ter­na­tional) for $55 mil­lion in April 2015, and re­named Con­cord In­ter­na­tional Hos­pi­tal, of­fer­ing can­cer-re­lated treat­ment, women’s health ser­vices and surgery.</p>
    <p>From March to Septem­ber last year, it was en­listed by MOH to help care for Covid-19 pa­tients who were clin­i­cally well but tested pos­i­tive for the virus.</p>
    <p>Since the sus­pen­sion, the “About Us” page on CIH’s web­site has been deleted, and leads to a bro­ken link. Links to the hos­pi­tal’s site have also been re­moved from Con­cord Med­i­cal’s web­site.</p>
    <p>CIH has yet to re­spond to any calls, text mes­sages or e-mails from The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>A state­ment posted on its Face­book page on Dec 23 said: “With in­put from MOH in view of the change of ownership, the man­age­ment has de­cided to take the op­por­tu­nity to ren­o­vate the hos­pi­tal, im­prove our pro­to­cols and in­tro­duce new ser­vices to bet­ter meet pa­tients’ needs mov­ing for­ward.”</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, the state­ment was amended to re­move the men­tion of the min­istry and the im­prove­ment of pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>Both ver­sions of the state­ment also said the hos­pi­tal would be re­launch­ing at the end of this month with “new spe­cial­i­ties and unique treat­ments with be­spoke ser­vice and a brand new name”.</p>
    <p>“It is time for the hos­pi­tal to pre­pare for the chal­lenges come 2021. We thank our de­part­ing man­age­ment team for work­ing tire­lessly in 2020 for the sake of na­tional ser­vice and keep­ing our fel­low cit­i­zens safe and well.</p>
    <p>“With the com­ing new year, comes a new post-Covid era for the med­i­cal in­dus­try, and a new dawn for Con­cord,” it added.</p>
