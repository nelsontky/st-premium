        HOME B3 THE STRAITS TIMES MONDAY, AUGUST 10, 2020 | | | A NATION’S STRENGTH HONOURED AND GRATEFUL My daughter knows that when I come home from work, she can’t hug me until after I shower. I’m honoured and grateful to receive the salute. If only the whole team could be here with me to receive this. ’’ AMBULANCE DRIVER MUHAMMAD FERDAUZ ABDUL KADIR, 39. EXTRA SPECIAL BIRTHDAY This is my first time taking part in the National Day Parade so it has made my birthday extra special. I hope Singapore always does its best and that regardless of race and religion, if there is trouble in Singapore, people will all come together. ’’ THIRD SERGEANT JUSTIN TAN, who turned 22 yesterday. ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME OPPORTUNIT­Y It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunit­y. Although it feels a bit different because the atmosphere is quieter and there’s no Kallang Wave or loud cheering, I’m glad I’m still able to witness the parade and represent the silat community here. ’’ MS ATIQ SYAZWANI, 27, a national silat athlete and physiother­apist at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. WORKING HARD TOGETHER It’s not easy getting a chance to watch the show live. During the pandemic, we have been working together very hard and Singapore has done well. We have proven in the last few months that together, we can overcome. ’’ MR VELUCHAMY MUNIAPPARA­J, 35, dormitory operations executive at the Homestay Lodge in Bedok.
