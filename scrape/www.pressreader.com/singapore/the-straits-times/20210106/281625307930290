    <p>Af­ter I re­alised that the Crim­i­nal Pro­ce­dure Code ap­plied to this, I did have sleep­less nights won­der­ing: Should I try to per­suade my col­leagues to change the law? But hav­ing thought about it, dis­cussed, con­sulted peo­ple both within and out­side this House, I’ve come to the con­clu­sion that right now we are do­ing well. We are able to keep Sin­ga­pore safe, we are able to deal with the cur­rent cri­sis. And so long as this Gov­ern­ment is able to main­tain our rep­u­ta­tion for open­ness, trans­parency, re­li­a­bil­ity, I think we are still on the right track.</p>
    <p>The TraceTo­gether pro­gramme will be stood down when the Covid-19 pan­demic ends, and much of the data col­lected will be deleted, said For­eign Min­is­ter Vi­vian Balakrishn­an yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He added that the Min­istry of Health (MOH) may want to re­tain epi­demi­o­log­i­cal data for re­search pur­poses, but that “it should be anonymised, it should not be per­son­alised, it should not be in­di­vid­u­alised”.</p>
    <p>He gave this as­sur­ance yes­ter­day as he told Par­lia­ment that the pur­pose of the TraceTo­gether pro­gramme is for con­tact trac­ing so that any chains of trans­mis­sion of Covid-19 can be quickly bro­ken.</p>
    <p>The is­sue of how the data can be used came up for dis­cus­sion in the House yes­ter­day, af­ter a re­ply to a par­lia­men­tary question the day be­fore sparked a furore.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs Des­mond Tan had said in a re­sponse to a question from Mr Christo­pher de Souza (Hol­landBukit Timah GRC) that un­der the Crim­i­nal Pro­ce­dure Code (CPC), the po­lice have the power to ob­tain data for crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions, and TraceTo­gether data is not ex­empt.</p>
    <p>Some had asked if this was in­con­sis­tent with what Dr Balakrishn­an had said be­fore – that the pro­gramme was to be used for con­tact trac­ing only.</p>
    <p>Dr Balakrishn­an, who is Min­is­terin-charge of the Smart Na­tion Ini­tia­tive, ac­knowl­edged that he had mis­spo­ken. “Af­ter I re­alised that the CPC ap­plied to this, I did have sleep­less nights won­der­ing: Should I try to per­suade my col­leagues to change the law?” he added.</p>
    <p>“But hav­ing thought about it, dis­cussed, con­sulted peo­ple both within and out­side this House, I’ve come to the con­clu­sion that right now we are do­ing well. We are able to keep Sin­ga­pore safe, we are able to deal with the cur­rent cri­sis,” he said.</p>
    <p>“And so long as this Gov­ern­ment is able to main­tain our rep­u­ta­tion for open­ness, trans­parency, re­li­a­bil­ity, I think we are still on the right track.”</p>
    <p>Sev­eral MPs, such as Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPher­son), Mr de Souza, and Mr Ger­ald Giam (Alju­nied GRC) had asked yes­ter­day how the po­lice would han­dle the data used for crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>To this, Dr Balakrishn­an and Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam said the po­lice would ob­tain the data only for in­ves­ti­ga­tions into se­ri­ous of­fences, such as mur­der or ter­ror­ism.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, a Min­istry of Home Af­fairs spokesman said the pow­ers un­der the Crim­i­nal Pro­ce­dure Code will have to be ex­er­cised if the data can­not be ob­tained vol­un­tar­ily, such as when the data be­longs to a sus­pect in a case.</p>
    <p>The spokesman noted that it is com­mon for wit­nesses and vic­tims to vol­un­teer data to the po­lice.</p>
    <p>TraceTo­gether, de­vel­oped for con­tact trac­ing dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, re­lies on a smart­phone app or to­kens to col­lect Blue­tooth prox­im­ity data to es­tab­lish who peo­ple have come into phys­i­cal con­tact with.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Dr Balakrishn­an stressed that this data is kept on peo­ple’s phones or TraceTo­gether to­kens and is au­to­mat­i­cally purged af­ter 25 days if not used for con­tact trac­ing pur­poses.</p>
    <p>He also noted that MPs and others have sug­gested on nu­mer­ous oc­ca­sions be­fore that TraceTo­gether should be made com­pul</p>
    <p>FOR­EIGN MIN­IS­TER VI­VIAN BALAKRISHN­AN, who is also Min­is­ter-in-charge of the Smart Na­tion Ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>sory, since Covid-19 presents a clear and present threat.</p>
    <p>But he had pushed as much as pos­si­ble to make it vol­un­tary be­cause he be­lieved that the pro­gramme could achieve suc­cess only if peo­ple fully un­der­stood its pur­pose and vol­un­tar­ily co­op­er­ate, he said.</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing TraceTo­gether as “per­haps the world’s most suc­cess­ful con­tact trac­ing pro­gramme”, Dr Balakrishn­an cred­ited this to peo­ple’s will­ing­ness to par­tic­i­pate in it, and thanked them for their trust and un­der­stand­ing and for tak­ing col­lec­tive re­spon­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>He added that this is why the Gov­ern­ment had wanted to be com­pletely above board and trans­par­ent in ad­dress­ing the use of TraceTo­gether data in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that each so­ci­ety has had to find a bal­ance be­tween pro­tect­ing pub­lic health dur­ing the pan­demic on the one hand, and per­sonal pri­vacy on the other, Dr Balakrishn­an said: “I be­lieve it is pos­si­ble to find that op­ti­mal point – by be­ing trans­par­ent, by be­ing open, by be­ing dili­gent, dis­ci­plined and do­ing our best all the time col­lec­tively.”</p>
