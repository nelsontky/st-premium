    <p>Sin­ga­pore and Ja­pan have agreed to work on “green lane” ar­range­ments to re­sume es­sen­tial travel be­tween both coun­tries and have them ready by next month, For­eign Min­is­ter Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan and his vis­it­ing coun­ter­part Toshim­itsu Motegi said yesterday.</p>
    <p>Both coun­tries are work­ing to­wards a spe­cial quota for cross-bor­der travel by work pass hold­ers, with talks on­go­ing to set this up as early as next month. There will also be a re­cip­ro­cal green lane for short-term busi­ness trav­ellers, and of­fi­cials have been tasked with fi­nal­is­ing an agree­ment by early next month.</p>
    <p>Yesterday, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong also wel­comed Mr Motegi at the Is­tana (above), with the Ja­panese for­eign min­is­ter be­ing his first over­seas vis­i­tor since the coro­n­avirus pan­demic led to en­try re­stric­tions and bor­der clo­sures. The lead­ers wore face masks and were seated at least 1m apart.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan is one of sev­eral coun­tries Sin­ga­pore is dis­cussing such green lanes with, and PM Lee noted that while they are pro­ceed­ing cau­tiously, “this will be an im­por­tant step for­ward in restor­ing con­nec­tiv­ity be­tween coun­tries, and ad­just­ing to life with Covid-19”.</p>
    <p>Es­sen­tial travel for ex­pa­tri­ates and busi­ness­men be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Ja­pan could re­sume next month, as both coun­tries agreed to ease re­stric­tions aimed at com­bat­ing the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The two coun­tries are cur­rently in talks to set up two tracks that will al­low cross-bor­der travel, said a joint state­ment by For­eign Min­is­ter Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan and his vis­it­ing Ja­panese coun­ter­part Toshim­itsu Motegi yesterday.</p>
    <p>The first track, called a “res­i­dence track”, will pro­vide for a spe­cial quota of cross-bor­der travel by work pass hold­ers with the nec­es­sary pub­lic health safe­guards – in­clud­ing a 14-day stay­home no­tice upon ar­rival in the re­spec­tive coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ters wel­comed on­go­ing ne­go­ti­a­tions aimed at set­ting up this track as early as next month.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond track is a re­cip­ro­cal green lane – known as a “busi­ness track” – where short-term busi­ness trav­ellers will be sub­ject to a con­trolled itinerary for the first 14 days, with the nec­es­sary pub­lic health safe­guards.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ters agreed on ma­jor points of this track, and tasked of­fi­cials with fi­nal­is­ing the agree­ment by early next month. This would make Sin­ga­pore one of the first coun­tries to be­gin this ex­change of busi­ness trav­ellers with Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>Mr Motegi, who is here on a three­day of­fi­cial visit un­til to­day, called on and was hosted to lunch by Dr Balakr­ish­nan yesterday. He also paid a cour­tesy call on Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong at the Is­tana.</p>
    <p>PM Lee noted that Mr Motegi is his first for­eign vis­i­tor since the pan­demic led to en­try re­stric­tions and bor­der clo­sures, and they had a good dis­cus­sion on how both sides can do more to­gether.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan is one of sev­eral coun­tries with which Sin­ga­pore is set­ting up such “green lanes” to al­low es­sen­tial travel to re­sume, with safety pre­cau­tions in place.</p>
    <p>“We are pro­ceed­ing cau­tiously, as Covid-19 is still very much a threat. But this will be an im­por­tant step for­ward in restor­ing con­nec­tiv­ity be­tween coun­tries, and ad­just­ing to life with Covid-19,” said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs (MFA) said both lead­ers af­firmed the close and long­stand­ing re­la­tion­ship be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Ja­pan, and ex­changed views on re­gional and in­ter­na­tional is­sues.</p>
    <p>They also dis­cussed how the two coun­tries can work to­gether to pro­mote greater eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion in the re­gion through the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said: “Prime Min­is­ter Lee wel­comed Ja­pan’s con­tin­ued en­gage­ment with Asean, and agreed that Sin­ga­pore and Ja­pan can fur­ther strengthen co­op­er­a­tion amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, such as in the fa­cil­i­ta­tion of cross-bor­der es­sen­tial busi­ness travel in a safe man­ner for both sides.”</p>
    <p>The MFA also said Dr Balakr­ish­nan and Mr Motegi had a good dis­cus­sion on re­gional and in­ter­na­tional de­vel­op­ments.</p>
    <p>“They agreed on the im­por­tance of en­sur­ing sup­ply chain con­nec­tiv­ity, mod­ernising in­ter­na­tional trade rules for the dig­i­tal econ­omy, and forg­ing part­ner­ships to pro­mote ‘vac­cine mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism’ amid the on­go­ing Covid-19 pan­demic,” it said.</p>
    <p>Mr Motegi leaves for Malaysia to­day. He is due to visit Pa­pua New Guinea, Cam­bo­dia, Laos and Myan­mar from Aug 20 to 25.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that Mr Motegi will have to take a Covid-19 test be­fore leav­ing and re­turn­ing to Ja­pan as a coun­ter­mea­sure against the disease. His en­tourage will also be kept to the bare min­i­mum and he will travel by char­tered plane.</p>
