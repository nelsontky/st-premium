    <p>BEI­JING • Thou­sands of peo­ple in north-west China have tested pos­i­tive for a bac­te­rial disease af­ter a leak from a state-owned bio­phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal plant mak­ing an­i­mal vac­cines last year.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials in Lanzhou city said 3,245 peo­ple had con­tracted bru­cel­losis, a disease of­ten caused by close con­tact with in­fected an­i­mals or an­i­mal prod­ucts that can bring about fevers, joint pain and headaches. An­other 1,401 peo­ple had an early pos­i­tive test re­sult for the disease, and the health au­thor­i­ties said there was no ev­i­dence of per­son-to-per­son trans­mis­sion so far.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties found that a bio­phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal plant had used ex­pired dis­in­fec­tant in its pro­duc­tion of bru­cella vac­cines for an­i­mals be­tween July and Au­gust last year – mean­ing the bac­te­ria was not erad­i­cated in its fac­tory ex­haust.</p>
    <p>Con­tam­i­nated gas from the China An­i­mal Hus­bandry Lanzhou Bio­phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal Fac­tory in Lanzhou formed aerosols con­tain­ing the bac­te­ria and this was then car­ried by wind to the Lanzhou Ve­teri­nary Re­search In­sti­tute, in­fect­ing nearly 200 peo­ple there as at De­cem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>More than 20 stu­dents and fac­ulty mem­bers of Lanzhou Univer­sity, some of whom had been to the in­sti­tute, sub­se­quently tested pos­i­tive as well, ac­cord­ing to Xin­hua News Agency.</p>
    <p>Lanzhou’s health com­mis­sion said yes­ter­day that sheep, cat­tle and pigs were most com­monly in­volved in the spread of the bac­te­ria.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the US Cen­tres for</p>
    <p>Disease Con­trol and Preven­tion, per­son-to-per­son trans­mis­sion of bru­cel­losis is “ex­tremely rare”, but some symp­toms may re­oc­cur or never go away. These in­clude re­cur­rent fevers, chronic fa­tigue, swelling of the heart and arthri­tis.</p>
    <p>The fac­tory – which apol­o­gised ear­lier this year – has had its bru­cel­losis vac­cine pro­duc­tion li­cence re­voked, the Lanzhou au­thor­i­ties said.</p>
    <p>Com­pen­sa­tion for pa­tients would start in batches from next month, ac­cord­ing to the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties.</p>
