    <p>SEOUL • A South Korean city that is home to the largest US over­seas mil­i­tary base has asked for coro­n­avirus tests to be done on Amer­i­can sol­diers be­fore they ar­rive, amid con­cerns over a re­cent spike in im­ported cases, of­fi­cials said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>United States Forces Korea (USFK) has re­ported at least 25 virus in­fec­tions among its troops and em­ploy­ees in the past two weeks, in­clud­ing 11 on Mon­day. All were con­firmed upon ar­rival or while spend­ing two weeks in manda­tory quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>The surge has prompted Pyeong­taek, home to the sprawl­ing Camp Humphreys south of Seoul, to ask the gov­ern­ment to re­quest a pre-de­par­ture test for in­com­ing US sol­diers, a city of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>“Luck­ily there’s no in­fec­tion within the base re­ported so far, but we thought a prior test could curb the num­bers and soothe con­cerns among res­i­dents,” said the of­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>USFK did not re­spond to a re­quest seek­ing com­ment. But it has said it is tak­ing ag­gres­sive quar­an­tine mea­sures, with fewer than 1 per cent of ac­tive duty per­son­nel hav­ing tested pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>All ar­rivals face a test, two weeks in iso­la­tion and a sec­ond test be­fore re­lease.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Health Min­istry of­fi­cial Son Young-rae de­scribed the US author­i­ties’ re­sponse to the virus as “ex­tremely strong”, adding that both sides are in close con­sul­ta­tion on fur­ther steps.</p>
    <p>A South Korean mil­i­tary of­fi­cial said more US troops were con­firmed in­fected as the cur­rent ro­ta­tion sea­son nears its end.</p>
    <p>About 28,500 US troops are sta­tioned in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-1953 Korean War that ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. Host to over 20,000 sol­diers, the Pyeong­taek gar­ri­son is the largest over­seas US base, sprawl­ing over an area of 14.7 mil­lion sq m.</p>
    <p>South Korea re­ported 39 new virus in­fec­tions yes­ter­day, among them 28 over­seas trav­ellers, for a 20th con­sec­u­tive day of im­ported cases in dou­ble dig­its.</p>
    <p>It un­veiled plans this week to seek pre-de­par­ture tests of vis­i­tors from six coun­tries, in­clud­ing Bangladesh and Pak­istan.</p>
