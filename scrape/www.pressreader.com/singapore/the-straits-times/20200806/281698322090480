    <p>ing tougher bor­der con­trols af­ter ex­pe­ri­enc­ing fresh cases of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The most pop­u­lous state, New South Wales (NSW), yes­ter­day recorded 12 new cases, mainly re­lated to clus­ters that orig­i­nated with peo­ple com­ing from Vic­to­ria.</p>
    <p>NSW Pre­mier Gla­dys Bere­jik­lian an­nounced yes­ter­day that any­one cross­ing from Vic­to­ria would have to un­dergo a 14-day ho­tel quar­an­tine at their own ex­pense.</p>
    <p>From to­mor­row, land bor­ders will be closed and trav­ellers must fly into NSW through Sydney air­port.</p>
    <p>“We are not an is­land, we are a state within a na­tion with ge­o­graphic prox­im­ity to, un­for­tu­nately, other states,” Ms Bere­jik­lian said. “We love our Vic­to­rian fel­low cit­i­zens, but their rates of in­fec­tion are in­cred­i­bly high at the mo­ment and not go­ing down.”</p>
    <p>The state of Queens­land also said it will close its bor­der to any­one</p>
    <p>MUM­BAI • In­dia re­ported 52,509 new cases of coron­avirus yes­ter­day, tak­ing its tally of in­fec­tions to more than 1.91 mil­lion – nev­er­the­less, the au­thor­i­ties eased re­stric­tions aimed at lim­it­ing its spread, al­low­ing gyms and yoga stu­dios to open.</p>
    <p>In­dia is one of the world’s hardest-hit coun­tries, with nearly 40,000 deaths from Covid-19, the dis­ease caused by the coron­avirus. But the Health Min­istry said In­dia’s fa­tal­ity rate was now 2.1 per cent, the low­est since the out­break first ap­peared.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has been strug­gling to stop the spread of the virus while also try­ing to min­imise the eco­nomic dam­age and the hard­ships that lock­downs in­flict on the poor.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties in the fi­nan­cial hub of Mum­bai al­lowed shops in malls to re­open af­ter more than four months of lock­down, as the num­ber of cases in the city that was hard hit by the out­break has be­gun to slowly de­cline.</p>
    <p>Cin­e­mas re­main closed and res­tau­rants in most parts of the coun­try are of­fer­ing only lim­ited ser­vices. On test­ing for the virus, the min­istry said 15,119 tests were be­ing con­ducted for ev­ery one mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>FORCED TO ACT</p>
    <p>We are not an is­land, we are a state within a na­tion with ge­o­graphic prox­im­ity to, un­for­tu­nately, other states. We love our Vic­to­rian fel­low cit­i­zens, but their rates of in­fec­tion are in­cred­i­bly high at the mo­ment and not go­ing ’’ down.</p>

    <p>com­ing from NSW and the Aus­tralian Cap­i­tal Ter­ri­tory from Satur­day. Ac­cess from Vic­to­ria has al­ready been banned.</p>
    <p>Queens­land, which is a pop­u­lar des­ti­na­tion for in­ter­state tourists from NSW and Vic­to­ria, recorded one new case yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Its pre­mier, Ms An­nasta­cia Palaszczuk, said the lat­est move would af­fect the econ­omy and was “go­ing to be tough”.</p>
    <p>“But your health comes first,” she said. “We have seen that Vic­to­ria is not get­ting bet­ter, and we’re not go­ing to wait for New South Wales to get worse.”</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria’s sec­ond wave is be­lieved to have been sparked by in­fec­tions of se­cu­rity guards at quar­an­tine ho­tels in Mel­bourne.</p>
    <p>This led to large clus­ters linked to fam­i­lies, schools and work­places, be­fore the virus even­tu­ally be­gan its ram­pant spread across the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria’s gov­ern­ment be­lieves that ca­sual work­ers con­trib­uted to the spread by turn­ing up for work de­spite be­ing in­fected. Ca­sual work­ers are of­ten less well-paid and do not re­ceive sick leave.</p>
    <p>An­other fac­tor is the in­ad­e­quacy of Aus­tralia’s aged-care sys­tem, with many homes un­der­funded and lack­ing ad­e­quate sup­plies and trained staff. Sev­eral homes have ex­pe­ri­enced clus­ters of in­fec­tions, lead­ing to large num­bers of deaths.</p>
    <p>But an­other rea­son for the fail­ure of the re­cent lock­down is that many peo­ple flouted so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules, per­haps due to com­pla­cency fol­low­ing the suc­cess of the first lock­down in March.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the surg­ing num­bers may have led to a new obe­di­ence.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Mr An­drews tweeted im­ages of Mel­bourne’s once busiest – but now empty – streets. “Thank you,” he wrote.</p>
