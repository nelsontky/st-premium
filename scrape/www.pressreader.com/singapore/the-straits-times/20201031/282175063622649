    <p>In Fe­bru­ary, a shift in po­lit­i­cal align­ment among mem­bers of the rul­ing coali­tion in Malaysia led to the Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) govern­ment’s down­fall.</p>
    <p>Barely seven months later, the coun­try’s politi­cians are again ne­go­ti­at­ing new al­liances which could trig­ger an­other change of govern­ment.</p>
    <p>The leader of the op­po­si­tion An­war Ibrahim re­cently de­clared that he had se­cured ma­jor­ity sup­port from MPs to be the next prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Many doubted his claim but the Perikatan Na­sional (PN) govern­ment sits on a ra­zor-thin, two-seat ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>There were ru­mours sug­gest­ing that some Umno (United Malays Na­tional Or­gan­i­sa­tion) lead­ers – cur­rently in PN – were toy­ing with the idea of de­fect­ing to Datuk Seri An­war’s camp.</p>
    <p>Given that Malaysian MPs’ loy­alty to their par­ties keeps shift­ing lately, what does this mean for party ide­olo­gies?</p>
    <p>MALAY NA­TION­AL­ISM, SEC­U­LAR­ISM AND IS­LAMISM</p>
    <p>Malaysian pol­i­tics were more pre­dictable in the past. For decades, there were only two com­pet­ing ide­olo­gies, and they were dif­fer­en­ti­ated by po­si­tions to­wards eth­nic­ity and re­li­gion.</p>
    <p>First is the Malay-led, multi-eth­nic one cham­pi­oned by Barisan Na­sional (BN) and sec­ond, the mer­i­to­cratic-sec­u­lar one led by the Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party (DAP).</p>
    <p>BN is led by three eth­nic-based par­ties: Umno for the Malays, Malaysian Chi­nese As­so­ci­a­tion and Malaysian In­dian Congress, plus other indige­nous par­ties from Sabah and Sarawak.</p>
    <p>In the 1980s, Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia (PAS) posed a strong chal­lenge to BN, di­vid­ing the Malay/Mus­lim vot­ers.</p>
    <p>In­spired by the global Is­lamic resur­gence move­ment, the party un­der­went a con­ser­va­tive turn, cham­pi­oning an Is­lamic state, syariah laws and lead­er­ship of the ulama (Is­lamic the­olo­gians).</p>
    <p>The BN, how­ever, re­mained dom­i­nant. Since its for­ma­tion in 1973 un­til 2008, it has been able to cap­ture two-thirds ma­jor­ity seats in Par­lia­ment, al­low­ing it to make amend­ments to the Con­sti­tu­tion at its whims and fancies.</p>
    <p>Politi­cians were very grounded in their re­spec­tive par­ties’ ide­ol­ogy. Dur­ing his first stint as prime min­is­ter be­tween 1981 and 2003, Tun Dr Ma­hathir Mo­hamad was con­sis­tent in pro­mot­ing the Malay na­tion­al­ist agenda, but was against Malaysia turn­ing into an Is­lamic theoc­racy, or purely mer­i­to­cratic Malaysian Malaysia.</p>
    <p>His main op­po­nents were Mr Lim Kit Siang from the DAP, a cham­pion of mer­i­to­cratic-sec­u­lar­ism, and Datuk Nik Aziz Nik Mat and Datuk Seri Ab­dul Hadi Awang from PAS, the pro­mot­ers of the Is­lamic state.</p>
    <p>In the 1980s and 1990s, co­op­er­a­tion be­tween PAS, Umno and DAP was un­think­able given their dis­sim­i­lar stances on re­li­gion and eth­nic­ity.</p>
    <p>CON­VER­GENCE OF PO­SI­TIONS ON RE­LI­GION AND ETH­NIC­ITY?</p>
    <p>Prag­matic pol­i­tics over­ruled the fix­a­tion over eth­nic and re­li­gious ide­olo­gies af­ter the 2008 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>BN failed to se­cure the two-thirds ma­jor­ity and lost con­trol of five states, and the op­po­si­tion agreed to down­play their ide­o­log­i­cal dif­fer­ences.</p>
    <p>DAP and PAS al­lied with Mr An­war’s Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat (PKR) to form the Pakatan Rakyat.</p>
    <p>The three par­ties con­tested as a sin­gle bloc in the 2013 elec­tion but broke up in 2015 as the dif­fer­ences over re­li­gion and eth­nic­ity, par­tic­u­larly the for­mer, resur­faced.</p>
    <p>Ide­o­log­i­cal dif­fer­ences were sus­pended again in the run-up to the 2018 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>PKR and DAP teamed up again, this time with their for­mer neme­sis Dr Ma­hathir un­der the PH coali­tion.</p>
    <p>The al­liance of for­mer arch­en­e­mies led to the his­toric top­pling of BN’s six-decade rule in Malaysia. In this par­tic­u­lar in­stance, the op­po­si­tion was will­ing to set aside dif­fer­ences over eth­nic­ity and re­li­gion out of ne­ces­sity to tackle the 1Malaysia Devel­op­ment Ber­had scan­dal.</p>
    <p>IN SEARCH OF NEW PO­LIT­I­CAL NAR­RA­TIVES</p>
    <p>How­ever, the con­stant shifts in align­ments and re­align­ments in Malaysian pol­i­tics to­day is bet­ter ex­plained by in­tra-ide­o­log­i­cal com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>Umno, Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia, PAS, and to some ex­tent Parti Amanah Ne­gara and PKR con­tinue to up­hold the Malay/Mus­lim dom­i­nance card, al­beit to vary­ing de­grees.</p>
    <p>To il­lus­trate, none of th­ese par­ties has ex­pressed will­ing­ness to ac­cept a non-Malay/Mus­lim prime min­is­ter. This ex­plains why their nom­i­nees for prime min­is­ter can­di­dates re­volve around fa­mil­iar names: Dr Ma­hathir, Mr An­war, Tengku Raza­leigh Hamzah, Tan Sri Muhyid­din Yassin, Datuk Seri Shafie Ap­dal and Mr Ab­dul Hadi.</p>
    <p>Ex­cept for the last name, all are cur­rent or for­mer Umno mem­bers.</p>
    <p>More­over, MPs within this camp can eas­ily form new pacts even though they may have been sworn en­e­mies in the past.</p>
    <p>In the same vein, the DAP will be de­monised as and when it serves the Malay-Mus­lim bloc.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, Malaysia needs to free it­self from the re­li­gion and eth­nic­ity frame­work of the past and search for new po­lit­i­cal nar­ra­tives in or­der to re­struc­ture the coun­try’s po­lit­i­cal cul­ture.</p>
    <p>The signs are al­ready vis­i­ble. Young Malaysians have stepped up and ex­plored new po­lit­i­cal dis­courses be­yond race or re­li­gion, such as hu­man rights and poverty, in their at­tempts to wres­tle power away from old, po­lit­i­cal oli­garchs.</p>
    <p>While nu­mer­ous im­ped­i­ments – such as get­ting mass sup­port from the elec­torate al­ready ac­cus­tomed to the old par­a­digm, and back­lash from se­nior politi­cians who pre­fer to re­tain the ex­ist­ing po­lit­i­cal cul­ture – await them, one way is to re­cal­i­brate the re­form agenda by look­ing through the so­cial class lens.</p>
    <p>It is time for a new breed of politi­cians to sug­gest so­lu­tions to press­ing con­tem­po­rary chal­lenges, such as the Covid-19 pan­demic, poverty erad­i­ca­tion, cli­mate change, cy­ber se­cu­rity and cor­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>The old play­book cen­tring on re­li­gion and eth­nic­ity is no longer rel­e­vant in com­bat­ing th­ese emerg­ing is­sues.</p>
