    <p>Bri­tish Trans­port Min­is­ter Grant Shapps said on Thurs­day that Sin­ga­pore and Thai­land have been re­moved from the list of coun­tries from which trav­ellers must quar­an­tine when en­ter­ing Eng­land. The same ap­plies for trav­ellers en­ter­ing Wales, Scot­land and North­ern Ire­land.</p>
    <p>The quar­an­tines are in place to curb the spread of Covid-19. Here are some things you need to know about trav­el­ling to Eng­land.</p>
    <p>Q I am ar­riv­ing in Eng­land soon. When will the quar­an­tine mea­sures be lifted?</p>
    <p>A If you ar­rive in Eng­land from Sin­ga­pore on or af­ter 4am to­day, you will not need to self-iso­late for 14 days. Those who ar­rived be­fore 4am to­day would have to un­dergo quar­an­tine for two weeks.</p>
    <p>Q Are there any con­di­tions?</p>
    <p>A You would have had to be in Sin­ga­pore – and any other ter­ri­tory on the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment’s list of travel cor­ri­dor coun­tries – for at least 14 days be­fore ar­riv­ing in Eng­land. The list can be viewed on the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment’s web­site at https://www.gov.uk/guid­ance/ coro­n­avirus-covid-19-travel-cor­ri­dors</p>
    <p>Q Are there any other mea­sures in place that I have to com­ply with?</p>
    <p>A All pas­sen­gers ar­riv­ing in the United Kingdom – ex­cept those who trav­elled from Ire­land, the Chan­nel Is­lands and the Isle of Man and stayed in those places for at least 14 days – will have to com­plete a pas­sen­ger lo­ca­tor form.</p>
    <p>The form can be filled in up to 48 hours be­fore ar­rival in the UK at https://www.gov.uk/pro­vide-jour­n­ey­con­tact-de­tails-be­fore-travel-uk</p>
    <p>There is cur­rently no re­quire­ment for trav­ellers en­ter­ing Eng­land to be tested for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Q If I start my jour­ney from Sin­ga­pore but spend time else­where be­fore ar­riv­ing in Eng­land, will I need to be quar­an­tined?</p>
    <p>A You will have to self-iso­late upon ar­rival in Eng­land if you leave Sin­ga­pore but stay in or tran­sit through a ter­ri­tory not on the UK travel cor­ri­dor list be­fore your ar­rival in Eng­land. You will not have to self-iso­late if you spent the 14 days prior to your ar­rival in Eng­land in places that are in­cluded on the list.</p>
    <p>Q Can I go to Eng­land for a hol­i­day?</p>
    <p>A With the re­moval of the quar­an­tine re­quire­ment and hav­ing met the afore­men­tioned con­di­tions, you will be able to be­gin your hol­i­day im­me­di­ately upon ar­rival from Sin­ga­pore. How­ever, any travel will be at your own risk. Ex­perts have warned that a sec­ond wave of Covid-19 in­fec­tions could break across Europe in the com­ing months. In Bri­tain, more than 3,000 new cases were re­ported in 24 hours for the sec­ond day in a row last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Q If I re­turn to Sin­ga­pore from Eng­land, do I need to be quar­an­tined?</p>
    <p>A Yes. Ac­cord­ing to the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment’s ad­vi­sory, all trav­ellers re­turn­ing from places other than Aus­tralia (ex­cept Vic­to­ria state), Ma­cau, China, Tai­wan, Viet­nam, Malaysia, Brunei and New Zealand will have to serve 14-day stay-home notices at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, if you left Sin­ga­pore from March 27 and re­turn here, you will have to bear the costs of Covid-19 tests and stay­ing at a ded­i­cated quar­an­tine fa­cil­ity, which are about $200 and $2,000, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>With the re­moval of the quar­an­tine re­quire­ment and hav­ing met the afore­men­tioned con­di­tions, you will be able to be­gin your hol­i­day im­me­di­ately upon ar­rival from Sin­ga­pore. How­ever, any travel will be at your own risk. Ex­perts have warned that a sec­ond wave of Covid-19 in­fec­tions could break across Europe in the com­ing months.</p>
