    <p>Miche­lin­starred de­liv­ery</p>
    <p>Of course, restau­rants did not sim­ply wring their hands in de­spair when dine-in was pro­hib­ited. Like hawk­ers, many piv­oted grace­fully.</p>
    <p>While speak­ing to econ­o­mist Song Seng Wun for a story be­fore the cir­cuit breaker, we talked about the pos­si­bil­ity of restau­rants be­ing closed to dine-in cus­tomers and how that would af­fect the in­dus­try. He floated the idea of Miche­lin-starred restau­rants de­liv­er­ing food to cus­tomers in lim­ou­sines. You can see why he is so sought af­ter for his views. The man is a nat­u­ral at think­ing out­side the box.</p>
    <p>And then, of course, it hap­pened. With­out the lim­ou­sines, but still.</p>
    <p>Odette at the Na­tional Gallery, with three Miche­lin stars, was de­liv­er­ing multi-course meals to what seemed like very happy campers. So, too, did Zen at Bukit Pa­soh, with two stars. The chefs were not try­ing to repli­cate the restau­rant ex­pe­ri­ence. In­stead, they re-tooled their menus, thought hard about what din­ers would want to eat and whether they had pa­tience to plate the food pret­tily at home.</p>
    <p>Other Miche­lin-starred restau­rants did the same, with vary­ing de­grees of suc­cess. Like chefs of high-end restau­rants around the world, they were will­ing to take a gam­ble to save jobs.</p>
    <p>Alinea in Chicago started of­fer­ing take­outs, mar­garita kits and dishes such as beef short rib Welling­ton. Noma in Copen­hagen opened a pop-up on its restau­rant grounds, of­fer­ing wine and burg­ers.</p>
    <p>They did so well that the own­ers seem a lit­tle be­mused.</p>
    <p>At its peak, Alinea was sell­ing 1,250 meals a night, mak­ing 75 per cent of its pre­vi­ous rev­enue.</p>
    <p>Co-owner Nick Kokonas tweeted: “We’ve been do­ing this all wrong for years.”</p>
