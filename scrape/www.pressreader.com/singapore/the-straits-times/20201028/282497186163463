    <p>TI­LOS IS­LAND (Greece) • The moon­light is the only light in the al­leys of Mikro Cho­rio, the an­cient cap­i­tal of the Greek is­land of Ti­los. And as in many other aban­doned villages in Greece, they only come back to life for the tourists.</p>
    <p>When night falls, Mikro Cho­rio (Lit­tle Vil­lage in Greek) awak­ens, as a hand­ful of vis­i­tors sip cock­tails at the small bar-mu­seum at the foot of the ru­ins.</p>
    <p>“We are try­ing to bring it back to life,” said the bar’s owner Gior­gos Alif­eris. For years now, be­tween 11pm and mid­night, he has been go­ing in his lit­tle van to pick up cus­tomers from Li­va­dia, the is­land’s port, where all the vil­lagers were re­lo­cated af­ter World War II.</p>
    <p>“There was no wa­ter, no elec­tric­ity, so peo­ple left look­ing for more com­fort,” Mr Alif­eris’s part­ner Va­nia Yor­danova said as she served drinks on the bar’s ter­race. She first had to rush to get the power gen­er­a­tor work­ing for the bar af­ter a bumpy 30-minute drive to Mikro Cho­rio.</p>
    <p>Then, the de­serted is­land vil­lage sud­denly lit up like a film set, melan­cholic Greek mu­sic echo­ing in the starry night.</p>
    <p>In the 1930s, the cap­i­tal of Ti­los – one of the Dode­canese is­lands in the south-east­ern Aegean Sea – still had 1,200 in­hab­i­tants, in­clud­ing three priests. But grad­u­ally the pop­u­la­tion headed to the port, where busi­ness was thriv­ing af­ter 1947 when the Dode­canese is­lands were an­nexed by Greece from Italy.</p>
    <p>By the 1960s, the school that had once served 180 pupils was also trans­ferred to the port and Mikro Cho­rio’s three cafes closed.</p>
    <p>Mr Alif­eris, who hails from the Pelo­pon­nese in western Greece, dis­cov­ered the aban­doned vil­lage of Mikro Cho­rio in the 1980s, af­ter he ar­rived on the is­land when his brother, a doc­tor, went to work there.</p>
    <p>“I thought it was re­ally sad that this vil­lage was de­serted and I had this crazy dream of bring­ing it back to life,” he said.</p>
    <p>He keeps the bar open three to four months ev­ery year, wel­com­ing a va­ri­ety of cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>“Vis­i­tors come from ev­ery­where – even from abroad – and the de­scen­dants of fam­i­lies who used to live in the vil­lage re­turn and they are re­ally moved,” Mr Alif­eris said.</p>
    <p>But the pro­ject, he said, has “cost me a lot, fi­nan­cially and psy­cho­log­i­cally” – fur­ther com­pli­cated by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, which has de­prived him of as much as 80 per cent of his rev­enue.</p>
    <p>Nor is he happy about the road that will be built to ac­cess the vil­lage, which he fears will “change the land­scape and the at­mos­phere”.</p>
    <p>Mikro Cho­rio is far from be­ing the only Greek vil­lage de­serted by its in­hab­i­tants who mi­grated to towns and cities in the search for jobs. And through a va­ri­ety of ini­tia­tives, both pub­lic and pri­vate, some lo­cal peo­ple are try­ing to breathe back life into some of those aban­doned places.</p>
    <p>Vathia, a vil­lage on the Mani Penin­sula in the south­ern Pelo­pon­nese, boasts spec­tac­u­lar views of the sea. But its derelict stone cas­tles and the scat­tered pos­ses­sions of its for­mer in­hab­i­tants give it a for­lorn at­mos­phere.</p>
    <p>Some tourists visit for the 18th­cen­tury square tow­ers still dom­i­nat­ing the vil­lage that, while still thriv­ing in the 19th cen­tury, was aban­doned be­cause of ur­ban mi­gra­tion. A gov­ern­ment-backed restora­tion pro­ject in the 1980s was in turn also scrapped, so the guest­houses re­mained with­out vis­i­tors i n the wind-bat­tered vil­lage.</p>
    <p>Not far from there, the for­ti­fied town of Mys­tras, a Unesco World Her­itage Site since 1989, has be­come a ma­jor at­trac­tion, one of the 10 most-vis­ited sites i n Greece. Tourists flock to its paved al­leys, ad­mir­ing the elab­o­rate fres­cos of the Byzan­tine churches and visit­ing the town’s monastery, which is still oc­cu­pied, even if the town it­self was de­serted in 1950.</p>
    <p>Spina­longa, a small aban­doned is­land off Crete, still at­tracts tourists cap­ti­vated by its dra­matic past. There, i n the Vene­tian fortress that has be­come an ar­chae­o­log­i­cal site, pa­tients suf­fer­ing from lep­rosy stayed there un­til the early 20th cen­tury.</p>
    <p>Spina­longa is also known as the set­ting for Vic­to­ria His­lop’s 2006 best­seller The Is­land, a his­tor­i­cal novel that was also adapted into a pop­u­lar Greek tele­vi­sion se­ries.</p>
    <p>Other aban­doned villages i n Greece also come to life to cater to tourists who are look­ing for un­usual des­ti­na­tions, like the 14th cen­tury Perithia on Corfu. Tav­erns in Perithia open only in the sum­mer for vis­i­tors, who are en­chanted by the derelict Vene­tian-style build­ings and the prospect of hik­ing to the sum­mit of Mount Pan­tokra­tor.</p>
