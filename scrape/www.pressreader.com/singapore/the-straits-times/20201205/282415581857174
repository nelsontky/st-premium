    <p>Mid­way through his 20-day sail last month, Mid­ship­man (MID) David Teo, who had only a few min­utes to call home, al­most missed talk­ing to his mother.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, the full-time na­tional ser­vice­man on a train­ing de­ploy­ment had been away from home for three weeks, in­clud­ing one week of iso­la­tion in camp be­fore sail­ing off as part of Covid-19 safety mea­sures.</p>
    <p>His mother, un­aware he was call­ing, told her pre-teen son who an­swered the call that she did not want to be dis­turbed.</p>
    <p>“My 12-year-old brother told her: ‘It’s kor-kor (Chi­nese di­alect for “older brother”), he has only got a few min­utes to talk to you!’ and my mother im­me­di­ately ran to the phone and asked how I was do­ing,” the 19-year-old re­counted, as he re­flected on how much he missed his fam­ily and home.</p>
    <p>“The few min­utes speak­ing to my brother and mum on the phone, that was when it hit me – what we sac­ri­fice to keep our na­tion safe,” he told The Straits Times on Mon­day, a day af­ter re­turn­ing from the land­ing ship tank (LST) RSS En­deav­our.</p>
    <p>LSTs are the largest ves­sels in the Sin­ga­pore navy, which has at least 30 ves­sels, in­clud­ing frigates, which are also used for train­ing mid­ship­men.</p>
    <p>The weeks at sea un­der the Mid­ship­men Sea Train­ing De­ploy­ment (MSTD) is part of MID Teo’s ninemonth train­ing to be a naval of­fi­cer in the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces.</p>
    <p>There are about 40 of them in his batch, one of three that typ­i­cally un­dergo the train­ing de­ploy­ment each year.</p>
    <p>The de­ploy­ment is among the navy’s train­ing and op­er­a­tions that have con­tin­ued through­out the pan­demic, but with some changes to the pro­gramme to en­sure safety amid Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The safety mea­sures in­clude the En­deav­our not dock­ing at any port, and, with no shore leave, the de­ploy­ment was short­ened from 28 to 20 days: Nov 9 to 29.</p>
    <p>The send-off for the mid­ship­men was also vir­tual.</p>
    <p>In­stead of par­ents and loved ones send­ing them off at Changi Naval Base, this time, MID Teo and his fel­low trainees sent mes­sages to their fam­i­lies via video, and these were shown on Nov 9 on the Sin­ga­pore navy’s Face­book.</p>
    <p>MID Teo laugh­ingly told his fam­ily he was on a “cruise to nowhere”.</p>
    <p>Course com­man­der Ma­jor Arens Ong, 32, was quick to stress that train­ing stan­dards have not been com­pro­mised. De­spite the changes, “they were still able to see that the navy con­tin­ues to be at the fore­front, con­tin­ues to be ready and en­gages our for­eign part­ners in ex­er­cises”, he said.</p>
    <p>The mid­ship­men also took part in two for­eign ex­er­cises: the Sin­ga­pore-In­dia-Thai­land Mar­itime Ex­er­cise in the An­daman Sea and the Sin­ga­pore-In­dia Mar­itime Bi­lat­eral Ex­er­cise in the An­daman Sea and In­dian Ocean.</p>
    <p>While on board the En­deav­our, the crew do not wear masks as they had un­der­gone an iso­la­tion pe­riod and tested neg­a­tive be­fore set­ting sail.</p>
    <p>Their daily rou­tine in­cludes car­ry­ing out their du­ties along­side the ship’s crew, who guide them in the op­er­a­tions at sea, such as the fir­ing of small arms and how to re­spond to con­tin­gen­cies.</p>
    <p>Mil­i­tary Ex­pert 2 Chong Hong Qin, 29, nav­i­ga­tion chief on the En­deav­our, said that by the end of the de­ploy­ment, he was proud to see that the mid­ship­men were pro­fi­cient in skills such as us­ing the nav­i­ga­tion radar and keep­ing a look­out for dan­gers in sur­round­ing wa­ters.</p>
    <p>MID Nisha Sun­der, 19, who be­came a reg­u­lar af­ter her A lev­els, said the most chal­leng­ing part was the packed pro­gramme, with only 12 days for prac­ti­cal lessons be­fore go­ing on the for­eign ex­er­cises, which lasted six days.</p>
    <p>“The MSTD gave me a bet­ter in­sight into how prac­ti­cal all the skills and lessons that I learnt were.</p>
