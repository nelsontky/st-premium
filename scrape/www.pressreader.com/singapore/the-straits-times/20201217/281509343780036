    <p>US Se­nate leader Mitch McCon­nell has spo­ken by phone with Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den, af­ter con­grat­u­lat­ing Mr Bi­den on his elec­tion vic­tory. The Repub­li­can leader’s ac­tions broke away from Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s drive to sow doubt about the elec­tion out­come.</p>
    <p>MOSCOW • Rus­sia’s Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin has fi­nally con­grat­u­lated Mr Joe Bi­den on hav­ing won the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion – more than a month af­ter the Demo­crat be­came the Pres­i­dent-elect.</p>
    <p>Mr Putin’s long de­lay in of­fer­ing con­grat­u­la­tions, while Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has re­fused to ac­cept the elec­tion re­sults, was widely viewed as a pre­lude to a frosty re­la­tion­ship be­tween the Krem­lin and Mr Bi­den’s White House.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, af­ter the Elec­toral Col­lege con­firmed Mr Bi­den’s vic­tory, the Krem­lin ended its wait and an­nounced that Mr Putin had sent the for­mer vice-pres­i­dent a “con­grat­u­la­tory tele­gram” mark­ing his “vic­tory in the United States pres­i­den­tial elec­tion”.</p>
    <p>“Vladimir Putin wished the Pres­i­dent-elect ev­ery suc­cess and ex­pressed con­fi­dence that Rus­sia and the United States, which bear spe­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity for global se­cu­rity and sta­bil­ity, can, de­spite their dif­fer­ences, ef­fec­tively con­trib­ute to solv­ing many prob­lems and meet­ing chal­lenges that the world is fac­ing today,” the Krem­lin’s state­ment said.</p>
    <p>Mr Putin was not alone in with­hold­ing good wishes, with some of Mr Trump’s clos­est al­lies over­seas tak­ing a wait-and-see ap­proach. These in­cluded Poland’s rightwing gov­ern­ment, with Pres­i­dent An­drzej Duda wait­ing un­til this week to of­fer his con­grat­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter the elec­tion of the Elec­toral Col­lege, I would like to con­grat­u­late you on the suc­cess­ful elec­tion re­sult and wish you a suc­cess­ful term of of­fice,” Mr Duda said in a state­ment. “Re­la­tions be­tween Poland and the USA are a pil­lar of se­cu­rity, Euro­pean and trans-At­lantic sta­bil­ity.”</p>
    <p>Two Latin Amer­i­can lead­ers also of­fered con­grat­u­la­tions to Mr Bi­den for the first time.</p>
    <p>Brazil’s Pres­i­dent Jair Bol­sonaro, a Trump ally, said in a tweet that he “will be ready to work with the new gov­ern­ment”. Pres­i­dent An­dres Manuel Lopez Obrador of Mex­ico sent a two-page let­ter to Mr Bi­den that noted “your stance in favour of mi­grants from Mex­ico and the rest of the world”.</p>
    <p>The de­lay in recog­nis­ing Mr Bi­den as Pres­i­dent-elect also al­lowed Rus­sian state me­dia to un­der­line, for its do­mes­tic au­di­ence, what it cast as the chaotic and il­le­git­i­mate na­ture of Amer­i­can democ­racy.</p>
    <p>But the Krem­lin also recog­nises that it will need to work with Mr Bi­den – not least on nu­clear arms con­trol, with a ma­jor treaty lim­it­ing US and Rus­sian nu­clear war­head num­bers ex­pir­ing on Feb 5.</p>
    <p>Both Mr Bi­den and Mr Putin have sig­nalled that they would like to ex­tend the treaty, but they will not be able to make it of­fi­cial un­til af­ter Mr Bi­den is in­au­gu­rated on Jan 20.</p>
