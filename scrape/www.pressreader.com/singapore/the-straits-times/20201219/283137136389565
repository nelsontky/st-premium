    <p>• Manch­ester City mid­fielder Kevin de Bruyne will not be rested in the com­ing weeks as he is cru­cial to the club’s hopes, with goals hard to come by this sea­son, man­ager Pep Guardi­ola said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>City are ninth in the Pre­mier League on 20 points, eight be­hind lead­ers Liver­pool, and have four games over the next 10 days, in­clud­ing a League Cup quar­ter-fi­nal at Arse­nal.</p>
    <p>De Bruyne has played 90 min­utes in each of City’s last seven league matches and also played twice for Bel­gium last month.</p>
    <p>But when asked if the 29-yearold would be rested for to­day’s Pre­mier League trip to Southamp­ton, Guardi­ola told re­porters: “No, right now, no. He’s too im­por­tant for us. He’s not go­ing to rest.</p>
    <p>“He rested in the Cham­pi­ons League, he rested in other games in the pre­vi­ous weeks... Right now, we need him.”</p>
    <p>With City’s main strik­ers ei­ther un­fit or in a rut, Guardi­ola is re­ly­ing heav­ily on his mid­field­ers and wingers for goals.</p>
    <p>Ar­gentina in­ter­na­tional Ser­gio</p>
    <p>Aguero has yet to open his ac­count in the league as in­juries have lim­ited his play­ing time and the Cata­lan re­vealed he was un­sure whether to risk him at St Mary’s af­ter he missed two day’s of train­ing ear­lier this week.</p>
    <p>On the fit­ness of City’s record scorer, who has just three topflight ap­pear­ances this term, Guardi­ola said: “I don’t know. Af­ter the game he could not train, yes­ter­day no train­ing, to­day, he trained.</p>
    <p>“He trained re­ally well but I don’t know how many min­utes (he will play against Southamp­ton).”</p>
    <p>With Brazil for­ward Gabriel Jesus net­ting just twice in the league this term, Guardi­ola urged his play­ers to help cre­ate more chances.</p>
    <p>To em­pha­sise his point, he com­pared the num­ber of goals they have scored with how many they had at this stage of their pre­vi­ous ti­tle-win­ning sea­sons.</p>
    <p>“The re­al­ity is com­par­ing the 40 goals we scored in the first 12 fix­tures in the year when we won our first Pre­mier League (in 2018), 36 for our sec­ond ti­tle (in 2019) and last sea­son, we had scored 35 by this stage. This year we have 18,” he added. “Last sea­son, we scored more goals than the cham­pi­ons (Liver­pool) but un­for­tu­nately, we con­ceded too much. We have to score more, ev­ery­body knows that, but it doesn’t de­pend on one spe­cific player. It is not just the re­spon­si­bil­ity of the strik­ers... Ev­ery­body is in­volved to cre­ate more clear chances.”</p>
    <p>Other than Aguero, City have no fur­ther in­jury con­cerns.</p>
