    <p>Look out, Dis­ney, Net­flix is try­ing to eat your lunch.</p>
    <p>In re­cent years, the stream­ing gi­ant has been mak­ing strate­gic moves into an­i­ma­tion, a genre long dom­i­nated by names such as Dis­ney, Pixar, Laika and DreamWorks.</p>
    <p>In 2018, the com­pany launched an in-house divi­sion to make its own an­i­mated films and shows – poach­ing top tal­ent from the in­dus­try to staff its ranks and en­tic­ing big names from live-ac­tion cin­ema, such as Os­car-win­ning di­rec­tors Taika Waititi and Guillermo del Toro, to head key projects.</p>
    <p>To se­cure ad­di­tional con­tent for its plat­form, Net­flix has inked deals with the chil­dren’s chan­nel Nick­elodeon (SpongeBob SquarePant­s, 1999 to present) and Ja­panese an­i­ma­tion house Stu­dio Ghi­bli (Spir­ited Away, 2001).</p>
    <p>It is also think­ing be­yond the tra­di­tional fam­ily au­di­ence, ven­tur­ing into more adult-ori­ented an­i­ma­tion as well as anime.</p>
    <p>All this gives Net­flix an edge in the stream­ing wars, which have taken on new ur­gency in the stayat-home era of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>A ro­bust an­i­ma­tion slate is an es­pe­cially valu­able weapon against ri­val Dis­ney, which launched its stream­ing plat­form Dis­ney+ in the United States and other mar­kets last year – with a vast li­brary of an­i­ma­tion and other fam­ily-friendly con­tent that could lure sub­scribers away from Net­flix.</p>
    <p>This is no doubt why Net­flix chief con­tent of­fi­cer Ted Saran­dos high­lighted the ser­vice’s an­i­mated of­fer­ings in an earn­ings call with in­vestors ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>But even with deep pock­ets – Net­flix is ex­pected to spend more than US$17 bil­lion (S$24 bil­lion) on all con­tent this year – there are chal­lenges be­ing the new­comer in this space.</p>
    <p>In an e-mail in­ter­view, Mr Gregg Tay­lor, its di­rec­tor of an­i­mated fea­tures, says: “When we opened our doors less than three years ago, we were es­sen­tially start­ing from scratch.</p>
    <p>“As a new stu­dio, (we) have no li­brary and no in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty, and my big­gest con­cern at the time was whether we could find enough qual­ity sto­ries that would al­low us to be­come a true des­ti­na­tion for fam­ily con­tent in a short amount of time.”</p>
    <p>The for­mer DreamWorks ex­ec­u­tive adds: “But we had an amaz­ing op­por­tu­nity to cre­ate huge change and in­no­vate within the an­i­ma­tion com­mu­nity. And, thank­fully, there was a pool of fan­tas­tic film-mak­ers ea­gerly await­ing a more non-tra­di­tional place to bring their sto­ries.”</p>
    <p>The ros­ter of tal­ent as­sem­bled is im­pres­sive.</p>
    <p>One of Net­flix’s big ti­tles later this year is the mu­si­cal Over The Moon, in­spired by the Chi­nese fa­ble of the moon god­dess. At the helm is le­gendary Dis­ney an­i­ma­tor Glen Keane, who worked on clas­sics such as The Lit­tle Mer­maid (1989) and Poc­a­hon­tas (1995).</p>
    <p>Other pres­tige projects are next year’s stop-mo­tion take on Pinoc­chio di­rected by del Toro (The Shape Of Wa­ter, 2017) and, in 2022, Ja­cob And The Sea Beast, a film by Moana (2016) co-di­rec­tor Chris Wil­liams.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Waititi – who wrote and di­rected Jojo Rab­bit (2019) and the block­buster Thor: Rag­narok (2017) – is de­vel­op­ing two an­i­mated se­ries based on the Char­lie And The Choco­late Fac­tory book (1964) and film (2005).</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s early ef­forts in this genre have left quite an im­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary this year, it had two horses in the Best An­i­mated Fea­ture Os­car race: Klaus, a quirky ori­gin story for Fa­ther Christ­mas; and the more adult I Lost My Body, an in­ven­tive fan­tasy about a sev­ered hand search­ing for its owner.</p>
    <p>An­i­ma­tion gi­ant Dis­ney had just one – Toy Story 4, which even­tu­ally won. But at the An­nies – the Os­cars of the an­i­ma­tion world – Klaus swept all seven awards it was up for, in­clud­ing Best Fea­ture.</p>
    <p>It is too early to say how many an­i­mated ti­tles Net­flix will re­lease each year, Mr Tay­lor says. “We are still in our in­fancy and an­i­mated films can take years to com­plete. But our ap­petite is big.”</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s goal is also to cre­ate a “truly global slate, with projects hail­ing from every con­ti­nent, pro­duced lo­cally and au­then­tic to the cul­ture they were de­vel­oped in while also ap­peal­ing to the world”, he adds.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, it wants to tell sto­ries that grab the whole fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“A lot of fam­i­lies watch Net­flix every day and an­i­mated films are one of the few things they will come to­gether to watch.</p>
    <p>“If we can give a fam­ily a rea­son to put aside the noise of the day and make them laugh, cry and sing to­gether, then we’ve done our job.”</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>KLAUS (2019)</p>
    <p>The Christ­mas ad­ven­ture com­edy of­fers an al­ter­na­tive ori­gin story for Santa Klaus, who is voiced by Os­car win­ner J.K. Sim­mons (Whiplash, 2014). It brought back hand-drawn,</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>I LOST MY BODY (2019)</p>
    <p>Also nom­i­nated for a Best An­i­mated Fea­ture Os­car, this beau­ti­fully strange French-lan­guage film 2D an­i­ma­tion and was a huge crit­i­cal suc­cess, sweep­ing seven An­nie Awards and a nom­i­na­tion for Best An­i­mated Fea­ture at the Os­cars ear­lier this year (2020). fol­lows a sev­ered hand as it es­capes from a lab­o­ra­tory and tries to re­con­nect with its body.</p>
