    <p>Staff at t he US’ con­sulate i n Chengdu pre­pared to leave yes­ter­day, re­mov­ing the in­signia from the build­ing as well as what ap­peared to be shred­ded doc­u­ments, amid tight se­cu­rity and heavy me­dia scru­tiny.</p>
    <p>The diplo­matic staff have un­til to­mor­row to va­cate the premises.</p>
    <p>On Fri­day, Bei­jing or­dered the clo­sure of the US con­sulate in a tit-for­tat move af­ter Wash­ing­ton or­dered the Chi­nese con­sulate in Hous­ton, Texas, to shut.</p>
    <p>China de­scribed its de­ci­sion as a “le­git­i­mate and nec­es­sary” re­sponse to “un­rea­son­able” US ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Work­ers could be seen re­mov­ing black trash bags – one of which split to show shred­ded pa­per in it – from the Chengdu con­sulate com­pound.</p>
    <p>Staff could also be seen mov­ing around in­side, AFP news agency re­ported, and the US in­signia was re­moved from within the com­pound.</p>
    <p>Out­side, the po­lice had closed off the street to pedes­tri­ans. Many peo­ple who were walk­ing on the other side of the road stopped to take pic­tures be­fore mov­ing on.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese state me­dia pro­vided a blow-by-blow ac­count of ev­ery de­vel­op­ment, and a live stream from out­side the con­sulate, which be­gan on Fri­day, had at­tracted 49.5 mil­lion view­ers by yes­ter­day evening.</p>
    <p>In Hous­ton, Chi­nese con­sular staff left the build­ing shortly af­ter 4pm lo­cal time on Fri­day (5am Sin­ga­pore time yes­ter­day), when the clo­sure or­der took ef­fect.</p>
    <p>A group of men who ap­peared to be US of­fi­cials were seen forc­ing open a back door of the con­sulate, Reuters re­ported.</p>
    <p>Af­ter they had gone in­side, two uni­formed mem­bers of the US State De­part­ment’s Bureau of Diplo­matic Se­cu­rity ar­rived to guard the door.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing said late yes­ter­day that US of­fi­cials had forced their way into the va­cated Chi­nese con­sulate.</p>
    <p>“China has ex­pressed strong dis­sat­is­fac­tion and firm op­po­si­tion to the US’ forced en­try into the Chi­nese Con­sulate-Gen­eral in Hous­ton, and has lodged solemn rep­re­sen­ta­tions,” said For­eign Min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin in a state­ment, adding that there will be a “proper and nec­es­sary re­sponse”.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Hous­ton Con­sul-Gen­eral Cai Wei posted a lengthy open let­ter on the con­sulate’s web­site, look­ing back on his stint and promis­ing to con­tinue sup­port­ing “friendly ex­changes” be­tween the Chi­nese and the Amer­i­can south.</p>
    <p>At times nos­tal­gic and hope­ful, the let­ter was a de­par­ture from the fiery rhetoric that has be­come com­mon in US-China in­ter­ac­tions in re­cent months. It was posted only on the Chi­nese ver­sion of the page.</p>
    <p>“Although the di­rec­tion of history is some­times tor­tu­ous due to the in­ter­fer­ence of a few peo­ple, the friend­ship be­tween the Chi­nese and Amer­i­can peo­ple will not be in­ter­rupted, and the bright prospects of friendly co­op­er­a­tion be­tween China and the United States can­not be stopped by any­one,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>Bi­lat­eral ties are in their worst state in years, with the world’s two largest economies at odds over a range of is­sues, in­clud­ing trade, es­pi­onage and China’s han­dling of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
