    <p>DU­RA­TION AND DIF­FI­CULTY</p>
    <p>Four hours, about 8,500 steps and two bus rides (two to three bus stops each). Mod­er­ately easy walk.</p>
    <p>HIGH­LIGHTS</p>
    <p>Kwong Wai Shiu Hos­pi­tal; Cen­tral Sikh Tem­ple; Ch­wee Kang Beo Tem­ple; Sri Man­matha Karunesh­varar Tem­ple; Jalan Be­sar Sta­dium; Al­lenby House and In­ter­na­tional Ho­tel; Pe­tain Road shop­houses; Holy Trin­ity Church</p>
    <p>THE GOOD</p>
    <p>Ar­chi­tec­ture fans will find much to in­trigue them on this trail. The build­ings run the gamut from tra­di­tional re­li­gious ar­chi­tec­ture to elab­o­rately dec­o­rated shop­houses to sleek Art Deco con­struc­tions.</p>
    <p>The Pe­tain Road shop­houses are a stun­ning sight, with elab­o­rate friezes, some of which are colour­fully painted. One of the an­i­mals looks dis­con­cert­ingly like a wer­erab­bit, but some of the flow­ers and birds are beau­ti­fully ren­dered.</p>
    <p>Also of note is the Holy Trin­ity Church, with dis­tinc­tive winged roof el­e­ments tiled in green that re­flect its Chi­nese roots.</p>
    <p>There are also un­ex­pected trea­sures. Ch­wee Kang Beo Tem­ple, for ex­am­ple, has a replica of a Ming-era junk made by a wor­ship­per who once built boats in the area, a nod to the district’s mar­itime roots.</p>
    <p>Kwong Wai Shiu Hos­pi­tal, founded in 1910, has been a land­mark in Seran­goon Road since 1960.</p>
    <p>Its her­itage gallery is un­for­tu­nately closed be­cause of Covid-19, but the grounds are worth a visit, as the pav­il­ion in the court­yard is open and the gar­den boasts trees planted by all three of Sin­ga­pore’s prime min­is­ters.</p>
    <p>THE BAD</p>
    <p>This is an­other un­gainly sprawl of a trail which takes a bit of plan­ning to get through. One also has to won­der at the in­clu­sion of the old New World amuse­ment park, the last of the pop­u­lar “Worlds” amuse­ment parks to close in 1987. Rem­nants of the old gate, in­cor­po­rated into a re­con­struc­tion, can be found at City Green park in Kitch­ener Road.</p>
