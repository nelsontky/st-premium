    <p>NEW YORK • North Korea is jump-start­ing the il­le­gal ex­port of coal af­ter shut­ting down al­most all ship­ments dur­ing the first few months of the year while it sought to block the spread of the coro­n­avirus, ac­cord­ing to a con­fi­den­tial United Na­tions re­port.</p>
    <p>Al­though ac­tiv­ity came to a near-halt be­tween Jan­uary and March, ship­ments of coal have re­sumed.</p>
    <p>Im­ports of goods and com­modi­ties by road and freight have also restarted, though not at pre-pan­demic lev­els, a panel mon­i­tor­ing the en­force­ment of sanc­tions on North Korea said in a re­port to the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>North Korea “con­tin­ued to flout Se­cu­rity Coun­cil res­o­lu­tions through il­licit mar­itime ex­ports of coal, though it sus­pended it tem­porar­ily”, the panel wrote. It cited ev­i­dence from one mem­ber show­ing that North Korea off­loaded coal in Chi­nese ter­ri­to­rial wa­ters in late March.</p>
    <p>North Korea’s econ­omy likely man­aged to eke out growth last year, but a de­ci­sion by its leader Kim Jong Un to shut bor­ders in Jan­uary due to the coro­n­avirus slammed the brakes on the lit­tle le­gal trade the state has, and could send the econ­omy into its big­gest con­trac­tion in more than two decades, ac­cord­ing to Fitch So­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>Even though North Korea has so far de­nied hav­ing any con­firmed cases of Covid-19, Ja­panese De­fence Min­is­ter Taro Kono said in June that he be­lieves the dis­ease may be spread­ing there and that Mr Kim is keep­ing to him­self to avoid in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>A coal ban im­posed by the UN is in­tended to de­prive the North Korean regime of the cash it needs to de­velop nu­clear weapons, but Py­ongyang rakes in hun­dreds of mil­lions of dol­lars through il­licit shipto-ship trans­fers.</p>
    <p>North Korea has also likely im­ported more pe­tro­leum this year than al­lowed un­der UN sanc­tions. China, which to­gether with Rus­sia has been call­ing on the UN to ease sanc­tions, has been ac­cused of look­ing the other way on sanc­tions eva­sion out of fear that a col­lapse of the Kim gov­ern­ment could trig­ger a hu­man­i­tar­ian cri­sis that would spread over its bor­der.</p>
