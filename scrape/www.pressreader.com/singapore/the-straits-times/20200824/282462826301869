    <p>The hum­ble man­hole cover might not seem like much of a blank can­vas, but one Ja­panese city is re-imag­in­ing the pos­si­bil­i­ties with il­lu­mi­nated ver­sions fea­tur­ing anime char­ac­ters.</p>
    <p>Tokorozawa, near Tokyo, is hop­ing the un­usual ad­di­tions will at­tract vis­i­tors, in­clud­ing en­thu­si­asts of the painted decorated man­hole cov­ers that adorn some of Ja­pan’s streets.</p>
    <p>“They’re Ja­pan’s first il­lu­mi­nated man­hole cov­ers,” city of­fi­cial Ju­nichi Koike said.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan is no stranger to dec­o­ra­tive man­hole cov­ers, boast­ing every­thing from or­nately en­graved ver­sions to ones painted with city mas­cots.</p>
    <p>Cities have been spruc­ing them up for at least four decades, with the goal of im­prov­ing the im­age of the sew­er­age sys­tem.</p>
    <p>A sub­cul­ture of man­hole cover fans has sprung up, with en­thu­si­asts swop­ping in­for­ma­tion on so­cial me­dia about their favourite ver­sions un­der the hash­tag #man­hotalk.</p>
    <p>“‘Man­holers’ en­joy dis­cov­er­ing dif­fer­ent kinds of man­hole cov­ers,” Mr Koike said. “We hope the new il­lu­mi­nated ones will fur­ther im­prove the dirty and smelly im­age of man­holes and also re­vi­talise the lo­cal econ­omy by bring­ing in vis­i­tors.”</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 28 man­hole cov­ers were in­stalled through­out the city on Aug 1, fea­tur­ing anime char­ac­ters such as Gun­dam ro­bot and from Neon Gen­e­sis Evan­ge­lion sci­encefic­tion an­i­ma­tion se­ries and The Melan­choly Of Haruhi tele­vi­sion se­ries.</p>
    <p>The cov­ers light up from 6pm to 2am us­ing so­lar power, il­lu­mi­nat­ing the pave­ments that lead from the city’s main train sta­tion to a new cul­tural com­plex fea­tur­ing an anime mu­seum.</p>
    <p>They are part of the project in which the city col­lects rev­enue by al­low­ing pri­vate com­pa­nies – in this case, ma­jor me­dia group Kadokawa – to use man­hole cov­ers for ad­ver­tis­ing.</p>
    <p>But while city of­fi­cials say the ex­tra street light­ing could serve as a crime de­ter­rent, se­cu­rity guards are hav­ing to ex­pand their pa­trols to pass by the cov­ers in case any­one tries to steal or dam­age them.</p>
    <p>The cov­ers have had a pos­i­tive re­cep­tion so far – from en­thu­si­asts and lo­cal res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>“They are more il­lu­mi­nated than I ex­pected,” man­hole fan Kaoru Morita, 55, said.</p>
    <p>“Usu­ally, when you are look­ing for man­holes, they are not so easy to spot. But I can see where these are from far away, so it’s help­ful for a per­son like me look­ing for them.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tat­suhiko Sato, 29, who lives in the city, ad­mits he was a bit sur­prised to see the cov­ers at first.</p>
    <p>“But it was a good sur­prise. The an­i­ma­tions I al­ways watch can also be en­joyed in this way. It’s also fun for chil­dren,” he said.</p>
    <p>There are about 15 mil­lion man­holes i n Ja­pan, but only a frac­tion fea­ture painted de­signs, which boost the cost of a cover from about US$600 (S$823) to some­times dou­ble that.</p>
    <p>The cost of the il­lu­mi­nated cov­ers has not been dis­closed, but is cov­ered by the spon­sor, and the funky fea­ture will stay in place for as long as the firm con­tin­ues to pay for it.</p>
