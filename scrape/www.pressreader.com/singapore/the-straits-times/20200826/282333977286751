    <p>Re­mem­ber Chi­nese ac­tion child star Shi Xiao­long? He rose to fame in the 1990s, star­ring in com­edy movies such as Shaolin Popey (1994).</p>
    <p>He is now all grown up and ap­pears in He­roes, a drama about leg­endary mar­tial artist Huo Yuan­jia, which is avail­able on iQiyi.</p>
    <p>The 32-year-old plays Chen Zhen, a fic­tional disciple of Huo, a role first played by movie star Bruce Lee in 1972’s Fist Of Fury.</p>
    <p>Shi says in an e-mail in­ter­view: “It’s my first time play­ing this char­ac­ter and his story is well­known but, ul­ti­mately, it’s a fic­tional char­ac­ter, so I don’t feel too much pres­sure play­ing him.</p>
    <p>“This drama is based on a new script so there are fresh el­e­ments to the story. My char­ac­ter also starts off as a young man and de­vel­ops from there, so there’s more for me to chew on – the process of mak­ing mis­takes and hav­ing to ma­ture as you age.”</p>
    <p>Play­ing Chen’s men­tor and the cen­tral char­ac­ter of Huo is Chi­nese ac­tor and mar­tial artist Vin­cent Zhao Wen­zhuo, best known for his por­trayal of Wong Fei Hung in Tsui Hark’s Once Upon A Time In China film and tele­vi­sion fran­chise (1991 to 1997).</p>
    <p>The 48-year-old ac­tor also por­trayed Huo in a 2001 drama ti­tled af­ter the char­ac­ter.</p>
    <p>On play­ing the same role nearly 20 years apart, he says: “I feel an affin­ity with Huo. Back then, the por­trayal was more en­er­getic but now, it’s more ma­ture and mel­low.</p>
    <p>“Di­rec­tor Guo Jingyu told me he thought it was time to update this char­ac­ter, so the nar­ra­tive, the char­ac­ter’s per­son­al­ity and even the fight chore­og­ra­phy are com­pletely dif­fer­ent.”</p>
    <p>Though Zhao and Shi are both mar­tial arts stars, their on-screen paths did not cross un­til He­roes.</p>
    <p>Zhao says: “I watched the films he acted in when he was young, and he’s grown up to be more ma­ture and more hand­some. We worked very well to­gether in the fight scene. The scene was good to go af­ter just one or two takes, so it was a thrill fight­ing with him.”</p>
    <p>For Shi, Zhao has been a good men­tor on and off screen.</p>
    <p>The younger ac­tor says: “One time, I had to film a scene in the rain and he pre­pared vi­ta­min sup­ple­ments for me and re­minded me to take them be­fore film­ing. It was a very warm ges­ture.”</p>
    <p>Shi, who took brief breaks in the mid-2000s for his stud­ies in New York at the Pro­fes­sional Chil­dren’s School, has mainly made a ca­reer out of mar­tial arts-re­lated roles.</p>
    <p>One notable ex­cep­tion is the ro­mance film Rhythm Of The Rain (2013), which was also lyri­cist Fang Wen-shan’s di­rec­to­rial de­but.</p>
    <p>Shi says of non-ac­tion roles: “To be able to put aside my mar­tial arts train­ing to play some­one in a ro­mance film was a fun chal­lenge for me. Ac­tion roles are my great love, but I won’t turn down some­thing that doesn’t have ac­tion in it.”</p>
    <p>Zhao, mean­while, is pass­ing down his mar­tial arts skills to the next gen­er­a­tion. The star is mar­ried to ac­tress Zhang Danlu and their nine-year-old son – one of four chil­dren – has been train­ing in mar­tial arts for more than a year.</p>
    <p>The proud fa­ther says: “He’s quite fit, but whether he’ll enter en­ter­tain­ment or be­come an ath­lete, that’s up to him. I won’t give him too much pres­sure.”</p>
