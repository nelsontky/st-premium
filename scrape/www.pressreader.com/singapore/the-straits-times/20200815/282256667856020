    <p>Trainer Michael Cle­ments seems to have a stran­gle­hold in to­mor­row’s $1 mil­lion Kranji Mile, which was post­poned from May 23 be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He has five strong can­di­dates in the ca­pac­ity field of 16, but the one feared by all is his 10-time win­ner Count of monte cr is to, who will be the favourite in Race 12 at 5.30pm.</p>
    <p>He also has Vit­to­ria Per­fetta, the last of the three emer­gency ac­cep­tors in the 1,600m race. But the horse is un­likely to se­cure a berth.</p>
    <p>With the high­est rat­ing of 115 and not hav­ing to con­cede weight to any of his ri­vals, with ev­ery run­ner car­ry­ing 57kg un­der the set-weight con­di­tion, Count of monte cr is to should de­liver the goods.</p>
    <p>The mul­ti­ple-Group win­ner is also in siz­zling form. He comes into the race with a su­perb last-start vic­tory and a top prepa­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>What’s more, there are no for­eign raiders this year to make it more com­pet­i­tive. The race is now re­stricted to Sin­ga­pore horses, in­stead of be­ing an in­vi­ta­tion race, due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong star South­ern Leg­end won the last two years, when the prize money was $1.5 mil­lion. But this has been cut by $500,000 to sus­tain the Sin­ga­pore rac­ing in­dus­try due to the “hugely neg­a­tive fi­nan­cial out­look’ for the fi­nan­cial year 2020/2021.</p>
    <p>The race sta­tus has also been down­graded from In­ter­na­tional Group 3 to do­mes­tic Group 1.</p>
    <p>Count of monte cr is to, owned by Gio­vanni Sta­ble, was su­perb in his come­back from the three-month Covid-19 lock­down and has thrived fur­ther.</p>
    <p>On Sin­ga­pore rac­ing’s re­sump­tion on July 11, the win­ner of three Group 2 and two Group 3 races put up a scin­til­lat­ing per­for­mance over the Poly­track 1,200m in Class 1.</p>
    <p>At one point, it looked like he was strug­gling to stay on track, as the lead­ers tore away.</p>
    <p>But, from about six lengths in ar­rears at the top of the straight, he grad­u­ally caught up to hit the front in the fi­nal 100m un­der French jockey Louis-Philippe Beuzelin’s vig­or­ous rid­ing. He car­ried the top im­post of 59kg and gave the run­ner-up Star Of Jupiter a mas­sive 9kg ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>Beuzelin was also astride two starts ear­lier, when “The Count” scored a big win in the Group 2 Chair­man’s Tro­phy over the same 1,600m trip as the Kranji Mile.</p>
    <p>It was two-from-two for Beuzelin and “The Count”. The hat-trick is in the off­ing. Last week, the com­bi­na­tion sig­nalled their chances by win­ning a trial in top fash­ion. It’s now all sys­tems go.</p>
    <p>While Count of monte cr is to is the ace is Cle­ments’ pack, the Zim­babwe-born trainer can also de­pend on his four other run­ners, no­tably Siam Blue Vanda and Cham­pion Three-Year-Old Top Knight.</p>
    <p>Safeer and On Line are lively out­siders.</p>
    <p>Siam Blue Vanda won the Group 2 Stew­ards’ Cup over 1,600m just two starts back on March 20 with his mighty run in the clos­ing stages.</p>
    <p>The ul­tra-con­sis­tent Top Knight fin­ished sec­ond. He lost by a mere short head.</p>
    <p>On Line fin­ished fourth and Vit­to­ria Per­fetta was a smack-up sixth.</p>
    <p>Although his back-up stars did not shine in their lead-up a fort­night ago, Cle­ments reck­oned that “things didn’t go their way” in their races. His team have im­proved.</p>
    <p>“The track was re­ally fast and seemed to favour front-run­ners,” said Cle­ments.</p>
    <p>“It was hard for back­mark­ers to make up ground and they didn’t get a clear run in the straight as well.</p>
    <p>“They ran okay and they were a lot bet­ter off for hav­ing had the run. They have come through the run well and I was very happy with their gal­lops.</p>
    <p>“Louis rode Count of monte cr is to and the horse is very well.”</p>
    <p>The big­gest threat to Cle­ments’ ar­mada is the Ri­cardo Le Grange­trained King Louis.</p>
    <p>The com­pe­tent Group run­ner and 2018 Group 3 El Do­rado Clas­sic win­ner was an eye-catch­ing sec­ond to Pass­port To Rome over 1,400m two weeks ago. Drawn well, he will give them a run for the money.</p>
    <p>Reign­ing Horse of the Year I’m In­cred­i­ble may have dis­ap­pointed in both his runs this year, but he may show his true colours to­mor­row.</p>
