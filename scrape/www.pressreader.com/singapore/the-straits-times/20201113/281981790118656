    <p>When a few of Ms Peng Xinyu’s pupils told her that Chi­nese char­ac­ters look like noth­ing more than sym­bols, the Chi­nese lan­guage teacher from Yio Chu Kang Pri­mary School knew she had to de­vise a plan to solve this.</p>
    <p>She de­cided to break apart Chi­nese char­ac­ters down to their strokes and cre­ated sim­ple short sto­ries out of them. Com­pared with the old method of sim­ply mem­o­ris­ing char­ac­ters, her pupils found that they were able to re­call how to write char­ac­ters much more eas­ily.</p>
    <p>And when it came to Chi­nese id­ioms which were harder to re­mem­ber, Ms Peng cre­ated ac­tions with sound ef­fects, wav­ing her arms en­er­get­i­cally and an­i­mat­edly.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Peng: “I think as a teacher, I need to ig­nite their in­ter­est and make them love Chi­nese.”</p>
    <p>Ms Peng, 33, was one of 10 teach­ers who re­ceived the Dis­tin­guished Chi­nese Lan­guage Teach­ers Awards yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The award, now in its 23rd year, aims to give recog­ni­tion to out­stand­ing Chi­nese lan­guage teach­ers who have been ex­em­plary in the teach­ing of the lan­guage and cul­ture. It was for­merly known as the In­spir­ing Chi­nese Lan­guage Teach­ers Awards.</p>
    <p>De­spite the Covid-19 pan­demic, about 170 teach­ers from 91 schools were nom­i­nated, with a to­tal of 650 nom­i­na­tions sent in.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the award cer­e­mony at the Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings (SPH) News Cen­tre au­di­to­rium, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong, re­fer­ring to the win­ners, said: “Your pas­sion to­wards ed­u­ca­tion and care to­wards your stu­dents have not only cre­ated a richer learn­ing ex­pe­ri­ence, but also brought out more of their po­ten­tial.”</p>
    <p>He thanked them for their ded­i­ca­tion and hard work, and en­cour­aged them to keep it up.</p>
    <p>An­other award win­ner was Mr Mu Zhim­ing, 41. The St Andrew’s Ju­nior School teacher writes com­pli­men­tary let­ters to his pupils who have done well in their spell­ing. The let­ters are made to look like of­fi­cial awards, and each in­cludes his sig­na­ture.</p>
    <p>He even snaps pic­tures of his “award win­ners” hold­ing up their let­ters to show to their par­ents.</p>
    <p>Mr Mu be­lieves that his role as a teacher is to bring some hope to the class­room.</p>
    <p>In line with the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion’s (MOE) shift to fo­cus on self­di­rected and blended learn­ing, Ms Eileen Chew Qian Ru, 34, who is head of the mother tongue depart­ment in Mayflower Sec­ondary school, fully em­braced tech­nol­ogy to en­gage with her stu­dents.</p>
    <p>She had learnt a lot dur­ing the home-based learn­ing pe­riod ear­lier this year and still prac­tises things such as record­ing her lessons and play­ing quizzes and games to im­prove her stu­dents’ learn­ing ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Each award win­ner re­ceived a cash prize of $1,500 and a tro­phy.</p>
    <p>The an­nual awards are or­gan­ised by Lianhe Zaobao, ZBS­chools.sg, and sup­ported by MOE.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee Huay Leng, head of SPH’s Chi­nese Me­dia group, em­pha­sised the im­por­tance of pre­serv­ing and pro­mot­ing the Chi­nese lan­guage and its cul­ture.</p>
    <p>She said: “Ev­ery­one can see China’s grow­ing power as a na­tion and its in­creas­ing in­flu­ence on our coun­try. How­ever, at the same time, the pro­fi­ciency of younger read­ers’ Man­darin is on the de­cline.</p>
    <p>“There­fore, we pay spe­cial at­ten­tion to the Dis­tin­guished Chi­nese Lan­guage Teach­ers Awards. We are happy to work with MOE on the path of sup­port­ing Chi­nese lan­guage learn­ing for our stu­dents.”</p>
    <p>In ap­pre­ci­a­tion for re­ceiv­ing the award, Ms Chew said: “When I rally (my teach­ers), ev­ery­one re­ally works to­wards a com­mon cause. In terms of get­ting this award, they def­i­nitely played a part in it.”</p>
