    <p>China-bash­ing in the run-up to the Novem­ber United States pres­i­den­tial elec­tion re­calls 19th cen­tury “Yel­low Peril” xenophobia, says Dr Mar­garet Chan. But this time, the Chi­nese are fight­ing back.</p>
    <p>The United States and China are en­gaged in a grim po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic ping-pong match.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, the US Trea­sury Depart­ment im­posed sanc­tions on 11 Hong Kong of­fi­cials, in­clud­ing Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam, for their part in im­ple­ment­ing the Bei­jing-di­rected Hong Kong na­tional se­cu­rity law. On Mon­day, China sanc­tioned 11 Amer­i­cans, in­clud­ing sen­a­tors Marco Ru­bio and Ted Cruz.</p>
    <p>The US, al­leg­ing espionage, had ear­lier last month or­dered China to close its con­sulate in Hous­ton by July 25. On that day China told the US to shut its con­sulate in Chengdu.</p>
    <p>Last year, US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi spoke of the Hong Kong pro-democ­racy protest as “a beau­ti­ful sight to be­hold”. This May, China’s Xinhua news agency said the Black Lives Mat­ter ri­ots pre­sented a “beau­ti­ful land­scape”.</p>
    <p>In the run-up to the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in Novem­ber, the US is in­dulging in China-bash­ing and the Chi­nese are re­tal­i­at­ing with “wolf war­rior” gusto. It was not al­ways like this.</p>
    <p>In the 19th cen­tury, China was “the sick man of Asia”, a coun­try over which im­pe­ri­al­ist forces ran roughshod.</p>
    <p>US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo, in a speech on July 23, noted that it was Pres­i­dent Richard Nixon’s em­brace of China in 1972 that had led to the res­ur­rec­tion of China’s fail­ing econ­omy. Now pow­er­ful, China schemes for global hege­mony so “the free world” must “dis­trust and ver­ify” Chi­nese over­tures of friend­ship, lest fu­ture gen­er­a­tions be crushed un­der “the ten­ta­cles of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party”.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo’s melo­dra­matic propo­si­tion of the lib­eral or­der brought to its knees by China re­calls the 1895 “Yel­low Peril” night­mare vi­sion of Kaiser Wil­helm II of Ger­many, who had imag­ined an in­va­sion of ra­pa­cious “yel­low men” who would sully the pu­rity of the mas­ter Aryan race.</p>
    <p>A FAS­CI­NAT­ING DREAD</p>
    <p>The Kaiser had wor­ried specif­i­cally about the Ja­panese who, hav­ing learnt Western in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion, had armed them­selves and now dared to tus­sle with the Euro­pean nations to grab a piece of China – once a fa­bled state, now brought to a state of penury.</p>
    <p>China was ruled by the Manchu Qing dy­nasty from 1644 to 1912. At the height of its power, the Qing em­pire stretched across China, Manchuria, Mon­go­lia, Tibet, Qing­hai and Xin­jiang. China was the world su­per­power of this time, so much so that philoso­phers Voltaire in France and Leib­niz in Ger­many, and states­man Ben­jamin Franklin in the US up­held Chi­nese so­ci­ety as a model for their own vi­sions of an en­light­ened rule by rea­son.</p>
    <p>But by the 19th cen­tury, the Chi­nese pop­u­la­tion had tre­bled in size. China had be­come by far the most pop­u­lous coun­try in the world and its agri­cul­tural econ­omy could not feed its peo­ple. Masses of im­pov­er­ished peas­ants em­i­grated to the Amer­i­cas, Aus­tralia, South Africa, South-east Asia and New Zealand where they be­came in­den­tured labour­ers who worked hard but never com­plained.</p>
    <p>Soon Chi­nese sto­icism be­gan to be re­marked upon. Physi­cist Al­bert Ein­stein com­mented that Chi­nese labour­ers per­formed like au­toma­tons, “even those re­duced to work­ing like horses never give the im­pres­sion of con­scious suf­fer­ing”.</p>
    <p>Pa­trick Laf­ca­dio Hearn, a Greek-Ir­ish writer spe­cial­is­ing in Ja­panese cul­ture, spec­u­lated in an ar­ti­cle in Amer­i­can mag­a­zine The At­lantic, in April 1896, on the con­se­quences of a Ja­panese con­quest of China, when Ja­panese mil­i­tarism would marry with Chi­nese in­domitabil­ity:</p>
    <p>“The Ja­panese dy­nasty would make no star­tling changes; China would still be China, but... in 10 or 15 years’ time a Chino-Ja­panese gov­ern­ment would have an army of two mil­lion men armed with Euro­pean weapons. In 25 years the avail­able force might be five times as great... If such a power chose to start on a ca­reer of con­quest, what could re­sist? Think what the Chi­nese are; think of their pow­ers of si­lent en­durance un­der suf­fer­ing and cru­elty; think of their fru­gal­ity; think of their pa­tient per­se­ver­ance, their slow, dogged per­sis­tence, their reck­less­ness of life. Fancy this peo­ple ruled by a na­tion of born or­gan­is­ers, who, half al­lied to them, would un­der­stand their tem­per­a­ment and their habits.”</p>
    <p>Hearn’s por­trait speaks elo­quently of “Yel­low Peril” be­liefs that the grow­ing power of East</p>
    <p>Asian peo­ples rep­re­sented an ex­is­ten­tial threat to Western civil­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The idea of re­pug­nant “yel­low in­cubi” im­preg­nat­ing white women found pop­u­lar ex­pres­sion in comics, nov­els, plays and movies – for ex­am­ples, see the Yel­low Peril post­card col­lec­tion on the Mas­sachusetts In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy’s Vi­su­al­iz­ing Cul­tures web­site. Typ­i­cal of the ex­ploita­tive use of anti-Chi­nese hys­te­ria was the fic­tional char­ac­ter Fu Manchu, a bo­gey­man who launched English nov­el­ist Sax Rohmer (1883-1959) on a suc­cess­ful ca­reer: “Tall, lean, and fe­line... with a brow like Shake­speare and a face like Satan... with all the cruel cun­ning of an en­tire Eastern race... all the re­sources of science (and) of a wealthy gov­ern­ment... Dr Fu Manchu, the yel­low peril incarnate.”</p>
    <p>Such propo­si­tions led to re­pu­di­a­tion. The Chi­nese Ex­clu­sion Act (1882) is the first and only ma­jor US fed­eral leg­is­la­tion that ex­plic­itly sus­pended im­mi­gra­tion for a spe­cific na­tion­al­ity.</p>
    <p>100 YEARS OF HU­MIL­I­A­TION</p>
    <p>In World War I, the fledg­ling Chi­nese repub­lic sent the largest non-Euro­pean work­force to Bri­tain, France and Rus­sia to dig trenches, work in mu­ni­tion plants, and per­form other ser­vices for the mil­i­tary. Many Chi­nese were killed in ac­tion and through disease.</p>
    <p>How­ever, with the con­clu­sion of the war, the Chi­nese were ex­cluded from all con­fer­ences among the vic­tors and, worse than that, the for­mer Ger­man colonies in the Shan­dong penin­sula were awarded to Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese felt that this act pro­posed the le­git­imi­sa­tion of Ja­panese im­pe­ri­al­ism in China and on May 4, 1919, thou­sands of stu­dents poured out of Bei­jing schools to protest and urge the boy­cotting of Ja­panese goods. The Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party counts its ide­o­log­i­cal birth from the May Fourth Move­ment.</p>
    <p>In World War II, the Na­tion­al­ist Army un­der Chi­ang Kai-shek and the Com­mu­nist Army un­der Mao Ze­dong joined forces to fight on the side of the al­lies. De­spite hav­ing noth­ing of the re­sources avail­able to their Western al­lies, the Chi­nese kept 600,000 Ja­panese sol­diers oc­cu­pied in China and out of the Pa­cific theatre. This war ef­fort has largely been for­got­ten by the West.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan had colonised the Korean penin­sula in the 35 years be­fore 1945. Korea had al­ways been a uni­fied penin­sula but when the de­feated Ja­panese ceded this ter­ri­tory to the Western forces, the Soviet Union and the US di­vided the coun­try into a com­mu­nist North and a demo­cratic South along the 38th par­al­lel.</p>
    <p>In 1950, North Korea in­vaded South Korea with a mind to re­uni­fy­ing the two ter­ri­to­ries, The US in­ter­vened, and China was obliged by Stalin to en­ter the war on the side of the North.</p>
    <p>In the Korean War (1950-1953) the “Yel­low Peril” vi­sion of an at­tack­ing hu­man wave was re­alised in the minds of Amer­i­can sol­diers by the way the Chi­nese fought, hurtling them­selves at their en­emy in the face of gun­fire, un­fazed by the cost of hu­man life. Mythic hor­rors of cap­tured Amer­i­can sol­diers brain­washed by the Chi­nese and re­turned to Amer­ica as zom­bie as­sas­sins were whis­pered.</p>
    <p>Al­though schol­ars have since dis­counted the idea of brain­wash­ing, the no­tion has not left the Amer­i­can imag­i­na­tion. The</p>
    <p>New York Times edi­to­rial of Nov 18, 2019, con­cern­ing Chi­nese pro­grammes among the Uighurs, was head­lined: “This is not dystopian fic­tion. This is China. Com­mu­nist lead­ers en­gage in mod­ern-day to­tal­i­tar­ian brain­wash­ing, bizarre lies and in­dus­trial-level in­doc­tri­na­tion to sup­press Mus­lims.”</p>
    <p>CHINA STANDS UP</p>
    <p>In 2015, the United Nations and the Western nations, in­clud­ing Ger­many, com­mem­o­rated the 70th an­niver­sary of the end­ing of World War II with solemn cer­e­monies and speeches. Rus­sia and China, how­ever, marked the date with splen­did mil­i­tary pa­rades, the day be­ing likely the last ma­jor an­niver­sary that liv­ing World War II veter­ans could at­tend.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese pa­rade took on spe­cial sig­nif­i­cance as this was the first time that such a prom­i­nent show had been put on outside Na­tional Day cel­e­bra­tions. It was also the first ma­jor pa­rade presided over by Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping, who had been elected Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party Gen­eral Sec­re­tary in 2012.</p>
    <p>In his anal­y­sis of the os­ten­ta­tious 2015 dis­play for Chi­naFile mag­a­zine, Dr Richard Bern­stein, who opened the Time mag­a­zine bureau in Bei­jing, re­called how on Oct 1, 1949, Mao had an­nounced the for­ma­tion of the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China with the mem­o­rable sen­tence: “China has stood up.” Dr Bern­stein said the mean­ing was ob­vi­ous: “After 100 years of hu­mil­i­a­tion at the hands of Western and Ja­panese im­pe­ri­al­ism, China has re­gained its na­tional dig­nity.”</p>
    <p>Mr Kevin Rudd, the for­mer Aus­tralian prime min­is­ter, writes how Chi­nese his­to­ri­og­ra­phy and its na­tional mem­ory con­tain “a pro­found sense of griev­ance with the col­lec­tive im­pe­rial West” and the Chi­nese feel “a sense of righ­teous cause about its own rise to­day”.</p>
    <p>AMER­I­CAN AT­TACKS BACK­FIRE</p>
    <p>In his speech of July 23, Sec­re­tary of State Pom­peo made a point to dis­tin­guish the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party from the Chi­nese pop­u­lace. The first rep­re­sented un­mit­i­gated evil, the sec­ond were peo­ple suf­fer­ing un­der au­thor­i­tar­ian rule.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Ash Cen­tre at Har­vard’s Kennedy School found, to the con­trary, that the cen­tral gov­ern­ment of China has en­joyed the con­sis­tent ap­proval of the Chi­nese peo­ple. In fact, ap­proval rat­ings rose from 86.1 per cent in 2003 to 93.1 per cent in 2016.</p>
    <p>While Mr Pom­peo seeks to rally the “free world” in the re­pu­di­a­tion of China, the world ap­par­ently does not hear the clar­ion call. In­stead, as The New York Times and The Washington Post re­ported in May, the world now sees the US as pitiable for its race prob­lems and Covid-19 dev­as­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>In these terms the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s at­tacks on China may be ig­nored as McCarthyit­e hys­te­ria or a piti­ful at­tempt to win a re-elec­tion by stok­ing xenophobia.</p>
