    <p>David Tre­mayne</p>
    <p>We cog­i­tated for some time on Sun­day evening, af­ter Ro­main Gros­jean’s ter­ri­fy­ing ac­ci­dent on the open­ing lap of the Bahrain GP, where we had last seen a rac­ing car burst into a ball of flame upon strik­ing a steel bar­rier.</p>
    <p>We de­cided that it was at Imola on April 23, 1989. Thirty-one years ago, when Ger­hard Berger crashed – and sur­vived.</p>
    <p>In the in­ter­ven­ing years, three F1 drivers have lost their lives in rac­ing ac­ci­dents: Roland Ratzen­berger and Ayr­ton Senna at Imola in 1994, and Jules Bianchi in 2015 af­ter a crash at Suzuka the year be­fore.</p>
    <p>Gros­jean can count him­self phe­nom­e­nally lucky that he did not join them, thanks to the im­pla­ca­ble search for safety in the sport that be­gan with Jackie Ste­wart’s cru­sade in the 60s fol­low­ing his ac­ci­dent in the 1966 Bel­gian GP.</p>
    <p>It was con­tin­ued with the work of Bernie Ec­cle­stone and Pro­fes­sor Sid Watkins and the in­tro­duc­tion by McLaren’s John Barnard and Ron Den­nis of the car­bon fi­bre com­pos­ite chas­sis in 1981.</p>
    <p>There were sub­se­quent un­stint­ing ef­forts to make cars and cir­cuits safer by the gov­ern­ing body (the FIA), For­mula One Man­age­ment (FOM) and the Grand Prix Drivers’ As­so­ci­a­tion (the GPDA) of which Gros­jean is a di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, pho­to­graphs of the crash re­vealed how the front end of the French­man’s Haas car had pen­e­trated the steel bar­ri­ers, while the mo­men­tum of a</p>
    <p>220kmh, 56G im­pact had ripped the rear end, com­pro­mis­ing the en­gine and trans­mis­sion, from the back of the mono­coque chas­sis.</p>
    <p>Yet that safety cell had re­mained suf­fi­ciently in­tact de­spite such forces and, to­gether with the head and neck re­straint sys­tem, had con­tin­ued to pro­tect the driver.</p>
    <p>From his bed in the Bahrain De­fence Force Hos­pi­tal in West Riffa, where he was treated for noth­ing worse than se­cond de­gree burns to his hands, Gros­jean spoke of the one other com­po­nent which had played such a cru­cial role in his mirac­u­lous de­liv­er­ance: the halo.</p>
    <p>When it was made manda­tory from the 2018 rac­ing sea­son, many drivers and purists were op­posed to the cast ti­ta­nium and car­bon fi­bre wish­bone-shaped struc­ture mounted atop the cock­pit to pro­tect the driver’s head.</p>
    <p>Gros­jean was one of its most vo­cal crit­ics, say­ing that it had no place in F1.</p>
    <p>Many saw it as the “Nanny State” in­vad­ing a sport prized for its ma­cho im­age.</p>
    <p>As the pho­to­graphs so graph­i­cally con­firmed, there is no ques­tion what­so­ever that the con­tro­ver­sial de­vice saved his life. From the charred re­mains of what had been a 355kmh race car, it could be gleaned that while the chas­sis was cracked by the front bulk­head, the in­tegrity of the struc­ture and the strength of the halo had pre­vented the steel bar­rier from reach­ing his head.</p>
    <p>There was an­other re­minder, too, amid the near tragedy, how up­lift­ing hu­man courage is. It was Prof Watkins who per­suaded Ec­cle­stone that a med­i­cal car should fol­low the field on the open­ing lap. The car, to­gether with mar­shals, was on the scene in sec­onds, and med­i­cal del­e­gate Ian Roberts went into the fire to help Gros­jean out, as his driver Alan van der Merwe blasted his fire ex­tin­guisher over them both.</p>
    <p>For­mula 1 dodged a bul­let in Bahrain, and you can bet that the les­son went deep. Mo­tor rac­ing is like hav­ing a pet rat­tlesnake and keep­ing it well fed; no mat­ter how con­tent you might think it is, you know it will bite if you aren’t care­ful.</p>
    <p>Tele­vi­sion has a habit of mak­ing it look slower than it is, un­til things go wrong. And over the years we have be­come used to men step­ping from the most alarm­ing wrecks – re­mem­ber Robert Ku­bica in Canada in 2007?</p>
    <p>Then just when you think you have thought of all the pos­si­bil­i­ties that Death likes to play with, he comes up with an­other. But we can take heart that the FIA will in­ves­ti­gate this in­ci­dent minutely, look­ing for ways they can make a dan­ger­ous sport safer still.</p>
    <p>Mo­tor rac­ing is like hav­ing a pet rat­tlesnake and keep­ing it well fed; no mat­ter how con­tent you might think it is, you know it will bite if you aren’t care­ful.</p>
