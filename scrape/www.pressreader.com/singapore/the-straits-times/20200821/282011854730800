    <p>Pub­lic con­fi­dence in the med­i­cal pro­fes­sion would have been damp­ened if no re­stric­tions were placed on two doc­tors ac­cused by a woman of tak­ing ad­van­tage of vul­ner­a­ble pa­tients for sex, the Sin­ga­pore Med­i­cal Coun­cil (SMC) said.</p>
    <p>The pub­lished grounds of de­ci­sion, is­sued on Wed­nes­day by the In­terim Or­ders Com­mit­tee (IOC) set up to look into this case, noted that de­tails of the al­le­ga­tions had ap­peared in The Straits Times on April 10.</p>
    <p>It said the me­dia cov­er­age had “am­pli­fied the po­ten­tial for pub­lic con­fi­dence in the pro­fes­sion to be un­der­mined if noth­ing is done”.</p>
    <p>Among other things, the two doc­tors in pri­vate prac­tice – Dr Ju­lian Ong Kian Peng, a sur­geon, and Dr Chan Herng Nieng, a psy­chi­a­trist – were ac­cused by the woman in a June 2018 com­plaint filed with the SMC of hav­ing ex­changed de­tails of pa­tients and col­leagues to “sat­isfy their im­moral de­sires”.</p>
    <p>Dr Ong then brought a defama­tion suit against the woman in July 2018. He lost the case on April 3 this year, as the dis­trict judge found the of­fend­ing state­ments made by the woman to be sub­stan­tially true. Dr Ong is ap­peal­ing the de­ci­sion. Fol­low­ing the court de­ci­sion and the en­su­ing pub­lic out­cry against the two doc­tors, the de­ci­sion to have a dis­ci­plinary hear­ing on this case was is­sued by the SMC’s Com­plaints Com­mit­tee on May 12, al­most two years after the com­plaint was made.</p>
    <p>The IOC was set up to see if steps need to be taken to pro­tect the pub­lic un­til the dis­ci­plinary tri­bunal de­cides on the case. Its de­ci­sion is valid for 18 months un­less the dis­ci­plinary tri­bunal is­sues its de­ci­sion be­fore then.</p>
    <p>The IOC said its task was “not a fact-find­ing one, nor is its re­mit to make any judg­ment on the merit of the crim­i­nal charges” but to as­sess the “risk of harm to mem­bers of the pub­lic, as well as what is in the pub­lic in­ter­est and what is in the med­i­cal prac­ti­tioner’s in­ter­ests”.</p>
    <p>Among other things, it de­creed that both doc­tors will not be al­lowed to con­tact fe­male pa­tients other than for med­i­cal pur­poses from June 18 this year.</p>
    <p>Ex­plain­ing the need for such in­terim in­junc­tions, the IOC said: “Shortly after the (court) de­ci­sion was re­ported, there was swift pub­lic re­ac­tion in the press call­ing for</p>
    <p>Shortly after the (court) de­ci­sion was re­ported, there was swift pub­lic re­ac­tion in the press call­ing for Dr Chan and Dr Ong to be dealt with sternly by the pro­fes­sion. They in­di­cated sus­tained and wide­spread con­dem­na­tion for the ac­tions of the doc­tors, and pointed to a risk of pub­lic con­fi­dence in the pro­fes­sion be­ing un­der­mined if their con­duct was left unchecked.</p>
    <p>Dr Chan and Dr Ong to be dealt with sternly by the pro­fes­sion.</p>
    <p>“They in­di­cated sus­tained and wide­spread con­dem­na­tion for the ac­tions of the doc­tors, and pointed to a risk of pub­lic con­fi­dence in the pro­fes­sion be­ing un­der­mined if their con­duct was left unchecked.”</p>
    <p>It quoted a let­ter from the As­so­ci­a­tion of Women for Ac­tion and Re­search (Aware) that ap­peared in the Fo­rum pages of The Straits Times which said it was “ap­palled” that the SMC had not sus­pended Dr Ong.</p>
    <p>Aware said the mes­sages be­tween the two doc­tors re­vealed dur­ing the dis­trict court hear­ing were “deeply misog­y­nis­tic” and “a be­trayal of what their pro­fes­sions stand for and their oath to do no harm”.</p>
    <p>In ask­ing for the IOC to take ac­tion, the SMC’s coun­sel ar­gued that al­though the ac­tual or planned sex­ual in­ter­ac­tions with fe­male pa­tients “may have been con­sen­sual, that did not de­tract from the po­ten­tial dam­age to pub­lic con­fi­dence”.</p>
    <p>The pro­fes­sional watch­dog said this is be­cause the un­der­ly­ing prin­ci­ple is clear: “Doc­tors must scrupu­lously avoid sex­ual con­tact with pa­tients, whether their own or those of oth­ers.</p>
    <p>“Whether those pa­tients were will­ing to en­gage in sex­ual ac­tiv­i­ties was be­side the point.</p>
    <p>“Once sex­ual bound­aries be­tween doc­tors and pa­tients were trans­gressed, the med­i­cal pro­fes­sion’s im­age suf­fered a stain – one which it can­not sim­ply ig­nore.”</p>
    <p>The IOC de­cided that the two doc­tors may con­tinue to prac­tise for 18 months or till the de­ci­sion of a dis­ci­plinary tri­bunal is reached.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing that pe­riod, the two doc­tors are not al­lowed to con­tact fe­male pa­tients for any pur­poses that are out­side the scope of med­i­cal prac­tice.</p>
    <p>Any con­tact as part of the med­i­cal prac­tice is to be made by a clinic staff mem­ber un­less the pa­tient is in hos­pi­tal or in their clin­ics for con­sul­ta­tion or treat­ment.</p>
    <p>They are also not to send the per­sonal data of their pa­tients to any other per­son un­less this is re­quired by their med­i­cal prac­tice or by law.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, should Dr Chan need to re­spond to a call to care for a pa­tient, he may do so but must record his deal­ings and sub­mit it to the SMC for re­view.</p>
    <p>WIDE­SPREAD CON­DEM­NA­TION</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>THE IN­TERIM OR­DERS COM­MIT­TEE, set up by the Sin­ga­pore Med­i­cal Coun­cil to look into the case, ex­plain­ing the need for in­terim in­junc­tions against the two doc­tors, such as for­bid­ding them from con­tact­ing fe­male pa­tients other than for med­i­cal pur­poses from June 18 this year.</p>
