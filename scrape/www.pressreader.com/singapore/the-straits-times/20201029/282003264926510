    <p>Cap­i­taLand, to­gether with 30 in­dus­try part­ners, is com­mit­ting up to $10 mil­lion in South-east Asia’s first in­dus­try-led lab­o­ra­tory to ac­cel­er­ate the devel­op­ment and de­ploy­ment of smart cities so­lu­tions in Sin­ga­pore and over­seas.</p>
    <p>Called the Smart Ur­ban Co-In­no­va­tion Lab, or Lab, it aims to pro­vide a real-world devel­op­ment and test-bed cen­tre at Sin­ga­pore Sci­ence Park, as well as a plat­form for var­i­ous play­ers such as lo­cal tech start-ups and global cor­po­rate en­ter­prises to co-cre­ate so­lu­tions for smart cities.</p>
    <p>Opened yes­ter­day by Mr S. Iswaran, Min­is­ter for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion and Min­is­ter-in­charge of Trade Re­la­tions, the Lab is de­signed to fur­ther en­hance Sin­ga­pore’s in­no­va­tion ecosys­tem by fo­cus­ing on close-to-mar­ket ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>At the open­ing, Mr Iswaran said the Lab epit­o­mises two im­por­tant as­pects of the way Sin­ga­pore is go­ing about its eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion – in­no­va­tion and part­ner­ships.</p>
    <p>“On the in­no­va­tion side, we recog­nise the need to come up with novel so­lu­tions and tech­nolo­gies as part of Sin­ga­pore’s longer-term com­pet­i­tive­ness and eco­nomic growth,” he said.</p>
    <p>He also lauded its “in­no­va­tion en­ter­prise ecosys­tem, which al­lows for the in­ter­ac­tion be­tween these dif­fer­ent en­ter­prise archetypes and for in­no­va­tion to come out”.</p>
    <p>The Lab, which takes up 5,400 sq ft – about the size of five five-room HDB flats – and is sup­ported by the In­fo­comm Me­dia Devel­op­ment Author­ity and En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore, will ini­ti­ate calls for pro­pos­als and work­shops, as well as fa­cil­i­tate proof-of­con­cepts and de­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>It is set to ben­e­fit some 200 com­pa­nies in Sin­ga­pore over the next three years.</p>
    <p>Mr Manohar Khi­atani, se­nior ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of Cap­i­taLand, said: “This Lab is in line with our goal to be a smart, sus­tain­able and com­mu­nity-ori­ented de­vel­oper.”</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, 30 in­dus­try play­ers, in­clud­ing Ama­zon Web Ser­vices, Cisco Sys­tems, Kone, Mi­crosoft, Sch­nei­der Elec­tric and TPG Tele­com, have com­mit­ted to part­ner­ing lo­cal firms to co­op­er­ate and test ideas or pi­lot tri­als for smart cities so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>The Lab will fo­cus on six key ar­eas – ad­vanced man­u­fac­tur­ing, dig­i­tal well­ness, in­tel­li­gent es­tates, smart mo­bil­ity, sus­tain­abil­ity and ur­ban agri­cul­ture.</p>
    <p>One lo­cal firm in­volved in the Lab is Vizzio.AI, a tech­nol­ogy com­pany de­vel­op­ing novel re­al­ity cap­ture tools for 3D map­ping us­ing satel­lite im­agery and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence al­go­rithms.</p>
    <p>Dr Jon Li, chief ex­ec­u­tive and co-founder of Vizzio.AI, said the Lab has brought him many leads, from gov­ern­ment to re­tail to real es­tate.</p>
    <p>“We have seen a lot of in­cu­ba­tors. But this Lab is prac­ti­cal and hands-on, and they brought us con­nec­tions and brought us leads,” he said.</p>
