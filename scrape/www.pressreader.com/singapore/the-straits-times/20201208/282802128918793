    <p>LON­DON • The family of Roald Dahl, late author of chil­dren’s clas­sics such as Char­lie And The Choco­late Fac­tory (1964), has apol­o­gised for anti-Semitic re­marks he made, say­ing the com­ments were “in­com­pre­hen­si­ble to us”.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish author, who died in 1990 aged 74, re­mains pop­u­lar with young read­ers around the world and sev­eral of his books such as The BFG (1982), Matilda (1988), Fan­tas­tic Mr Fox (1970) and, most re­cently, The Witches (1983) have been turned into movies and stage shows.</p>
    <p>How­ever, con­tro­versy has oc­ca­sion­ally flared up over his anti-Semitic com­ments, par­tic­u­larly those made in a 1983 in­ter­view with Bri­tain’s New States­man mag­a­zine.</p>
    <p>“There is a trait in the Jewish char­ac­ter that does pro­voke an­i­mos­ity, maybe it’s a kind of lack of gen­eros­ity to­wards non-Jews,” he said, adding that “even a stinker like Hitler didn’t just pick on them for no rea­son”.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on the of­fi­cial web­site of the or­gan­i­sa­tions that man­age his legacy, copy­rights and trade­marks and a mu­seum ded­i­cated to him, the Dahl family apol­o­gised for what it said was the last­ing and un­der­stand­able hurt his re­marks had caused.</p>
    <p>“Those prej­u­diced re­marks are in­com­pre­hen­si­ble to us and stand in marked con­trast to the man we knew and to the val­ues at the heart of Roald Dahl’s sto­ries, which have pos­i­tively im­pacted young peo­ple for gen­er­a­tions,” it said.</p>
    <p>“We hope that, just as he did at his best, at his ab­so­lute worst, Roald Dahl can help re­mind us of the last­ing im­pact of words.”</p>
    <p>Di­rec­tor Steven Spiel­berg was asked about Dahl’s anti-Semitic com­ments in 2016, when he was at the Cannes film fes­ti­val pro­mot­ing his adap­ta­tion of The BFG (2016).</p>
    <p>Spiel­berg said he had been un­aware of the com­ments when he took on the project, adding the book was about em­brac­ing dif­fer­ences and that was the value he had sought to im­part in telling the story.</p>
    <p>Other high-pro­file adap­ta­tions of Dahl’s works have in­cluded two big-bud­get movie ver­sions of Char­lie And The Choco­late Fac­tory (1971 and 2005), one of Fan­tas­tic Mr Fox (2009) and a stage mu­si­cal ver­sion of Matilda that has been a hit in Lon­don and on Broad­way.</p>
    <p>A new movie ver­sion of The Witches, di­rected by Robert Ze­meckis and star­ring Anne Hath­away as the Grand High Witch, was re­cently re­leased on HBO Max by Warner Broth­ers stu­dio.</p>
