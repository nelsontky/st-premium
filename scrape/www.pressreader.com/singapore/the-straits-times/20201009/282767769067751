    <p>SEOUL • Calls are mount­ing within South Korea for mem­bers of mega­band BTS to be granted al­ter­na­tives or de­lays to manda­tory mil­i­tary ser­vice, with some law­mak­ers and fans ar­gu­ing they are al­ready do­ing plenty for their coun­try with­out wear­ing a sol­dier’s uni­form.</p>
    <p>By law, all able-bod­ied men in South Korea be­tween the ages of 18 and 28 must serve in the mil­i­tary for roughly two years as part of the coun­try’s de­fences against North Korea.</p>
    <p>The band’s el­dest mem­ber, Jin, is 27 and will be re­quired to sign up by the end of next year. The other six mem­bers will reach the age of con­scrip­tion over the next few years.</p>
    <p>In the past, South Korea has granted ex­emp­tions to high- pro­file ath­letes such as Tot­ten­ham Hot­spur for­ward Son He­ung-min, as well as classical mu­si­cians such as award-win­ning pi­anist Cho Seongjin. To date, there have been none granted to K-pop stars.</p>
    <p>“Not ev­ery­one has to take up a ri­fle to serve the coun­try,” Mr Noh Woong-rae, a senior mem­ber of South Korea’s rul­ing Demo­cratic Party, told a party meet­ing on Mon­day in com­ments that re­ceived wide­spread me­dia cov­er­age.</p>
    <p>Mr Noh sug­gested BTS mem­bers could work as am­bas­sadors in their overseas trav­els to pro­mote a group of islets at the cen­tre of a ter­ri­to­rial dis­pute with Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>His com­ments fol­low a pro­posal by fel­low party mem­ber Jeon Yonggi last month to re­vise the law to al­low some K-pop stars to de­lay their ser­vice un­til the age of 30.</p>
    <p>“For the sake of fair­ness, we are not talk­ing about ex­empt­ing them from their duty, but pop mu­si­cians and artists like BTS – their ca­reers can blos­som in their twen­ties,”</p>
    <p>Mr Jeon, who has the back­ing of a dozen law­mak­ers, told Reuters.</p>
    <p>“We can­not let mil­i­tary duty block their way at the height of their ca­reers,” he said.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic also ap­pears to sup­port spe­cial treat­ment for the band, which have just be­come the first South Korean group to reach No. 1 on the United States Bill­board Hot 100 sin­gles chart and have a mas­sive global fan base.</p>
    <p>In a Sept 21 sur­vey by South Korean news web­site Kuki News, 31.3 per cent of re­spon­dents</p>
    <p>be­lieved the band should not have to com­plete their mil­i­tary ser­vice, while an­other 28.6 per cent sup­ported post­pone­ment. About 30.5 per cent sup­ported nor­mal mil­i­tary ser­vice.</p>
    <p>The group’s la­bel, Big Hit En­ter­tain­ment, de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>In­di­vid­ual mem­bers have pre­vi­ously said they are will­ing to com­plete their ser­vice.</p>
    <p>“Mil­i­tary ser­vice is the nat­u­ral duty and when duty calls, I will re­spond any time,” Jin told a news con­fer­ence in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
