    <p>Cer­tifi­cate of en­ti­tle­ment (COE) prices mostly ended lower at the lat­est tender yesterday – the sec­ond after a three-month sus­pen­sion.</p>
    <p>When bid­ding ended at 4pm, the COE price for cars up to 1,600cc and 130bhp closed at $32,699, 2.45 per cent lower than its pre­vi­ous close on July 8.</p>
    <p>The COE pre­mium for cars above 1,600cc or 130bhp fin­ished 2.47 per cent lower at $35,001.</p>
    <p>The com­mer­cial ve­hi­cle COE price dipped 2.51 per cent to end at $23,888.</p>
    <p>The COE price for mo­tor­cy­cles dropped 15.48 per cent to $6,510.</p>
    <p>The only ex­cep­tion to the fall in prices was the Open COE cat­e­gory, which can be used for any ve­hi­cle type ex­cept mo­tor­cy­cles but ends up mostly for big­ger cars. It closed 0.03 per cent higher at $35,001.</p>
    <p>Traders had said that the rise in COE prices across the board in the pre­vi­ous round was due to pent-up de­mand that was par­tially cooled by a slight in­crease in COE sup­ply.</p>
    <p>Bid­ding had been on hold from April to last month when non-es­sen­tial busi­nesses were closed to stem trans­mis­sion of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Mr Ray­mond Tang, manag­ing di­rec­tor of Yong Lee Seng Mo­tor, said yesterday that the slight dip in prices was due to a correction after prices surged in the last cy­cle.</p>
    <p>But he ex­pects COE prices to rise again in the next three months. This is due to an ex­pected lower quota for the bid­ding pe­riod from Au­gust to Oc­to­ber, and more peo­ple turn­ing to cars as a safer trans­port op­tion amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Tang, who is honorary sec­re­tary at the Sin­ga­pore Ve­hi­cle Traders As­so­ci­a­tion, added: “A lot of agents are wor­ried about a sec­ond wave of Covid-19 in­fec­tions, which could mean that COE bid­ding and busi­nesses might stop again.</p>
    <p>“So now, when­ever there are any or­ders in hand, they will want to clear them as soon as pos­si­ble.”</p>
