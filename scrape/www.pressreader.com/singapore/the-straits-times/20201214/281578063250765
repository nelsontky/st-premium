    <p>World lead­ers at a Cli­mate Am­bi­tion Sum­mit on Satur­day of­fered only in­cre­men­tal steps and few spe­cific, short-term com­mit­ments to counter global warm­ing. The un­der­whelm­ing sum­mit puts more pres­sure on US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den to con­vince some of the world’s big­gest green­house gas emit­ters to step up.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>Five years af­ter the world signed the land­mark Paris Agree­ment to avoid dan­ger­ous global warm­ing, po­lit­i­cal mo­men­tum is build­ing. But the lack of near-term de­tail means the planet is still on track for cli­mate catas­tro­phe.</p>
    <p>The six-hour Cli­mate Am­bi­tion Sum­mit on Satur­day threw the prob­lem into sharp re­lief: ac­tivists were ea­ger for China to put some meat on the bones of its bold 2060 car­bon neu­tral­ity pledge.</p>
    <p>They were dis­ap­pointed. One coun­try af­ter an­other failed to raise the bar, as lead­ers of­fered only in­cre­men­tal steps.</p>
    <p>“As en­cour­ag­ing as all this am­bi­tion is, it is not enough,” said Bri­tish Busi­ness Sec­re­tary Alok Sharma, who is also pres­i­dent of the next round of global cli­mate talks in Glas­gow next year, known as COP26.</p>
    <p>The un­der­whelm­ing sum­mit puts more pres­sure on Pres­i­den­t­elect Joe Bi­den, who is ex­pected to as­sert US lead­er­ship on cli­mate change when he takes of­fice, start­ing with re­join­ing the Paris deal.</p>
    <p>As po­lit­i­cal and cor­po­rate lead­ers jos­tle to prove how pro­gres­sive they are on the is­sue, the chal­lenge is get­ting them to make spe­cific, short-term com­mit­ments that back up their im­pres­sive-sound­ing long-term goals.</p>
    <p>Coun­tries’ level of am­bi­tion should in­crease be­tween three­fold and five­fold to de­liver on the Paris pledge to try and limit warm­ing to below 2 deg C, ac­cord­ing to the United Na­tions Emis­sions Gap Re­port.</p>
    <p>“We know we’re in a race – be that a sprint or a marathon – and what’s crit­i­cal is mo­men­tum,” said Pro­fes­sor Rachel Kyte, dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts Univer­sity, and a for­mer UN cli­mate en­voy. “We are not mov­ing fast enough, but we are mov­ing.”</p>
    <p>While green­house gas emis­sions will fall a record 7 per cent this year as the pan­demic hit eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity, the dip will re­sult in only a 0.01 deg C re­duc­tion of global warm­ing by 2050, the UN said.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den wants to con­vene a sum­mit within his first 100 days in of­fice to con­vince some of the world’s big­gest emit­ters to step up, and set a net-zero tar­get for the United States for 2050.</p>
    <p>His plans mean that 70 per cent of the world econ­omy will have made com­mit­ments to be car­bon neu­tral by 2050 or 2060.</p>
    <p>In the pri­vate sec­tor, com­pa­nies from as­set man­agers to oil ma­jors have set long-term tar­gets to elim­i­nate car­bon emis­sions.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Union and Bri­tain went into the sum­mit with new emis­sions pledges in hand, in the EU’s case af­ter a diplo­matic tussle.</p>
    <p>Some of the more am­bi­tious pledges by the 75 na­tions and com­pa­nies on Satur­day in­cluded Ar­gentina and the Vat­i­can pledg­ing car­bon neu­tral­ity by 2050, and Pak­istan vow­ing to stop build­ing new coal-fired power plants and set­ting a goal to get 60 per cent of its power from re­new­ables by 2030.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, Peru pledged to cut emis­sions 40 per cent by 2030, up from a pre­vi­ous tar­get of 30 per cent.</p>
    <p>But more lim­ited an­nounce­ments were also made, such as Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping say­ing China would seek to cut emis­sions per unit of GDP by more than 65 per cent from 2005 lev­els by 2030, slightly rais­ing the pre­vi­ous tar­get of cut­ting pol­lu­tion by 60 per cent to 65 per cent.</p>
    <p>The big­gest chal­lenge for Mr Bi­den and the COP26 hosts ahead of the Glas­gow sum­mit will be con­vinc­ing world lead­ers who cham­pion fos­sil fu­els to make a U-turn.</p>
    <p>The lead­ers of Brazil, Rus­sia and Aus­tralia were not in­vited to speak on Satur­day af­ter Bri­tain and co­host France de­cided they had not come for­ward with bold enough pledges.</p>
    <p>Their sur­prise at their ex­clu­sion un­der­scores how wide an ex­pec­ta­tion gap still re­mains be­tween cli­mate-aligned coun­tries and lag­gards who have so far been able to avoid too much scru­tiny on the in­ter­na­tional stage.</p>
    <p>Even af­ter new pledges, rich coun­tries risk fail­ing to meet a tar­get set five years ago to mo­bilise US$100 bil­lion (S$134 bil­lion) a year by 2020 to help poor na­tions deal with the worst im­pacts of cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>“So far, the mem­bers of the G-20 are spend­ing 50 per cent in their stim­u­lus and res­cue pack­ages on sec­tors linked to fos­sil fuel pro­duc­tion and con­sump­tion, than on low-car­bon en­ergy,” said UN Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral An­to­nio Guter­res. “This is un­ac­cept­able.”</p>
