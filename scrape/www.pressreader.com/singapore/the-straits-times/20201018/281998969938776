    <p>• Cana­dian Prime Min­is­ter Justin Trudeau on Fri­day said he will con­tinue to stand up against China’s “co­er­cive diplo­macy” and hu­man rights abuses in Hong Kong and Xin­jiang af­ter be­ing re­buked by Bei­jing for sim­i­lar com­ments last week.</p>
    <p>“We will stand up loudly and clearly for hu­man rights all around the world, whether it is talk­ing about the sit­u­a­tion faced by the Uighurs, whether it is talk­ing about the very con­cern­ing sit­u­a­tion in Hong Kong, whether it’s call­ing out China for its co­er­cive diplo­macy,” he said in a news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Trudeau said he was not look­ing to es­ca­late ten­sions with China. A long-run­ning diplo­matic dis­pute heated up again when Bei­jing took is­sue with Mr Trudeau’s ear­lier com­ments.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, the Chi­nese en­voy to Ottawa, Mr Cong Peiwu, warned Canada against grant­ing asy­lum to Hong Kong pro-democ­racy pro­test­ers.</p>
    <p>Cana­dian daily The Globe and Mail said Ottawa had re­cently granted asy­lum to a Hong Kong cou­ple, which the Cana­dian govern­ment has nei­ther con­firmed nor de­nied.</p>
    <p>In a video press con­fer­ence, Mr Cong said: “We strongly urge the Cana­dian side not (to) grant so­called po­lit­i­cal asy­lum to those vi­o­lent crim­i­nals in Hong Kong be­cause it is in­ter­fer­ence in China’s do­mes­tic af­fairs. And cer­tainly, it will em­bolden those vi­o­lent crim­i­nals.</p>
    <p>“So if the Cana­dian side re­ally cares about the sta­bil­ity and the pros­per­ity in Hong Kong, and re­ally cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Cana­dian pass­port hold­ers in Hong Kong, and the large num­ber of Cana­dian com­pa­nies op­er­at­ing in Hong Kong... you should sup­port those ef­forts to fight vi­o­lent crimes,” Mr Cong added.</p>
    <p>China and Canada are mark­ing 50 years since they forged diplo­matic ties – but those re­la­tions are now deeply strained.</p>
    <p>The diplo­matic dis­pute stems from the ar­rest of Huawei chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer Meng Wanzhou, a Chi­nese cit­i­zen, in Van­cou­ver in late 2018 on a bank fraud war­rant is­sued by the US au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Meng has said she is in­no­cent and is fight­ing ex­tra­di­tion in a Cana­dian court.</p>
    <p>Shortly af­ter her ar­rest, China jailed former Cana­dian diplo­mat Michael Kovrig and Cana­dian busi­ness­man Michael Spa­vor on charges of spy­ing, an act widely seen in western cap­i­tals as an act of reprisal by Bei­jing. China also halted im­ports of canola seed from Canada.</p>
    <p>In a sign of the ris­ing ten­sions be­tween the two coun­tries, Cana­dian For­eign Min­is­ter Fran­coisPhilip­pe Cham­pagne had ear­lier slammed the Chi­nese am­bas­sador’s re­marks as “to­tally un­ac­cept­able and dis­turb­ing”.</p>
    <p>For his part, the new leader of the con­ser­va­tive op­po­si­tion, Mr Erin O’Toole, called on the Chi­nese diplo­mat “to fully re­tract his re­marks and is­sue a pub­lic apol­ogy”.</p>
    <p>“Should the am­bas­sador fail to do so ex­pe­di­tiously, we ex­pect the govern­ment to with­draw his cre­den­tials,” he said.</p>
