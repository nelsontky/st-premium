    <p>Com­pa­nies are tak­ing a more mea­sured ap­proach to­wards hav­ing their work­ers back amid more re­laxed rules.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, the Gov­ern­ment said that more work­ers can re­turn to their work­places from next Mon­day.</p>
    <p>But many com­pa­nies said they are not rush­ing to get all their work­ers back to the work­place as telecom­mut­ing has be­come com­mon with the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The In­sti­tute for Hu­man Re­source Pro­fes­sion­als also said that work­ing from home is here to stay, not­ing that there are now fewer con­cerns over lower pro­duc­tiv­ity and per­for­mance, go­ing by a re­cent sur­vey.</p>
    <p>More peo­ple are be­ing al­lowed to re­turn to the of­fice next Mon­day, but em­ploy­ers are not rush­ing to have them back.</p>
    <p>A range of com­pa­nies – from banks to start-ups – told The Straits Times that their work­ers will only be eased back into the of­fice, given that work-from-home re­mains the de­fault mode amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Firms are now used to telecom­mut­ing, a trend that In­sti­tute for Hu­man Re­source Pro­fes­sion­als chief ex­ec­u­tive Mayank Parekh said is here to stay.</p>
    <p>He cited a sur­vey by soft­ware com­pany En­gageRocket dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, in which more than 80 per cent of re­spon­dents said they saw them­selves work­ing from home more than half the time.</p>
    <p>“Con­cerns over pro­duc­tiv­ity and per­for­mance are di­min­ish­ing, with more than 70 per cent of re­spon­dents re­port­ing that they took the same or less time to achieve the same level of pro­duc­tiv­ity as pre-Covid-19,” he added.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment an­nounced on Wed­nes­day that more staff would be al­lowed to re­turn to work­places as Sin­ga­pore cau­tiously re­opens the econ­omy amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But em­ploy­ers have to en­sure safe man­age­ment mea­sures at the work­place and have flex­i­ble work­ing hours, as well as stag­gered re­port­ing times, among other things.</p>
    <p>Graphic de­signer Jerome Koh, 30, said that he has not been in­formed by his bosses on whether he needs to re­turn to the of­fice but would like to be given a choice in</p>
    <p>the mat­ter. “I have got used to work­ing from home, and while I miss my col­leagues, there are some days I feel more pro­duc­tive in the quiet of my home,” he said.</p>
    <p>The na­ture of the work, how­ever, is a fac­tor in whether stay­ing at home re­mains an op­tion.</p>
    <p>OE Man­u­fac­tur­ing man­ag­ing direc­tor James Wong said that “al­most all” of his staff have re­turned to work, be­cause of the need to op­er­ate heavy ma­chin­ery.</p>
    <p>Ms Jac­que­line Ye, co-founder of Del­e­gate, a firm which helps peo­ple plan­ning events to source venues and ven­dors such as food cater­ers, said it has “ad­justed to work­ing re­motely pretty eas­ily”.</p>
    <p>Still, she hopes to bring staff back to the of­fice to build team spirit and cul­ti­vate a sense of be­long­ing.</p>
    <p>“We are look­ing to slowly ease our team back into work­ing from the of­fice, start­ing next month,” she said.</p>
    <p>“We will stag­ger our teams and have only three or four peo­ple at the of­fice at any one time.”</p>
    <p>United Over­seas Bank (UOB) group hu­man re­sources head Dean Tong said that about half of the bank staff have re­turned to work in of­fices and branches. UOB is “test­ing sce­nar­ios in which more of our peo­ple will be able to work re­motely”, Mr Tong said.</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank group cor­po­rate se­cu­rity head Fran­cisco John Ce­lio said: “The bank does not have a tar­geted per­cent­age ra­tio of how many staff should work in the of­fice.”</p>
    <p>He added: “We will con­tinue to take a phased ap­proach to have more on-site staff to sup­port the in­crease in eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties safely.”</p>
    <p>DBS Bank has been mov­ing “small pock­ets of em­ploy­ees in crit­i­cal bank­ing func­tions back to the of­fice” since the first phase of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing kicked off, a bank spokesman said.</p>
    <p>It ex­pects more em­ploy­ees to re­turn to the of­fice grad­u­ally over the next few months, the spokesman added.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, about 70 per cent of its l ocal work­force work from home, down from the 80 per cent dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Stan­dard Char­tered Bank said that teams across the in­sti­tu­tion are pro­gres­sively start­ing to stag­ger work hours, among other mea­sures. “We will not hes­i­tate to step up the mea­sures where nec­es­sary,” it said in a state­ment, adding that those work­ing in the of­fice com­prised about 25 per cent of staff.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion chief ex­ec­u­tive Ho Meng Kit said mem­bers should ad­here to ap­pro­pri­ate safe man­age­ment mea­sures, while Sin­ga­pore Man­u­fac­tur­ing Fed­er­a­tion pres­i­dent Dou­glas Foo called on ev­ery­one to pro­ceed with cau­tion.</p>
