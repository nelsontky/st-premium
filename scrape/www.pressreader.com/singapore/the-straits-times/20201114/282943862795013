    <p>The Toy­ota Corolla Altis has been the world’s best-sell­ing car for years and has no short­age of chal­lengers to its crown.</p>
    <p>The lat­est Mazda 3, launched last year, is a keen con­tender. And now, it is joined by Hyundai’s new Avante.</p>
    <p>Right off the bat, this Hyundai fast­back saloon makes its pres­ence felt. Longer, wider, lower and with a wheel­base ex­tended by 20mm to 2,720mm, it is also roomier.</p>
    <p>Bold sculp­tured lines across its flanks i mme­di­ately set the car apart from its ri­vals. Its front is no less dra­matic, with a cas­cad­ing grille (chromed on the Elite vari­ant) spread­ing out to blend with its slim head­lamps (LEDs for Elite). Those fol­low­ing the car at night will no­tice an LED strip link­ing both tail­lamp clus­ters – a seg­ment first.</p>
    <p>In­deed, the Avante turns heads like a su­per­car. In my 30 years as a mo­tor­ing writer, I had never seen teenagers stop, stare and dou­ble back with phone in hand at the sight of a mass mar­ket sedan. But I no­ticed this with the Avante.</p>
    <p>There is an­other thing in its favour – the au­tho­rised agent cur­rently has no plans to sell this car to pri­vate-hire firms. Ad­mit it or not, car own­ers here are a tad snooty (and for good rea­sons) and many will not want their car as­so­ci­ated with the blue la­bel.</p>
    <p>The Avante is built on a new plat­form and lighter than its key ri­vals. It is also fit­ted with a new-gen­er­a­tion con­tin­u­ously vari­able trans­mis­sion which im­i­tates the be­hav­iour of tra­di­tional au­to­boxes. So, even though its en­gine out­put re­mains largely un­changed, the car is quicker (10.4 sec­onds to 100kmh ver­sus 11.6 pre­vi­ously), and more ef­fi­cient (5.4 litres/100km ver­sus 6.7).</p>
    <p>In real life, the car av­er­aged 6.6 litres/100km, com­pared with its pre­de­ces­sor’s 12 litres/100km.</p>
    <p>At the wheel, the Avante feels sturdy and ag­ile, al­most like a 3-se­ries be­fore BMW em­braced forced in­duc­tion. It feels quicker than its cen­tury sprint sug­gests. Low-end per­for­mance is es­pe­cially im­pres­sive, with most com­mutes ac­com­plished within 2,500rpm. Open the throt­tle wide and the car re­sponds with a fist­ful of revs, courtesy of its trig­ger-happy trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Its ride is sup­ple enough for com­fort, yet strong enough to with­stand en­thu­si­as­tic han­dling. The car stops bril­liantly too, with less dive upon hard brak­ing than most.</p>
    <p>In­side, the car is a leap from the pre­vi­ous model. It has a wrap­around dash oc­cu­pied by a 10.25-inch in­stru­men­ta­tion screen and an 8-inch in­fo­tain­ment mon­i­tor. It comes with wire­less Ap­ple CarPlay and An­droid Auto, as well as a wire­less phone charg­ing pad.</p>
    <p>The car packs plenty of new ac­tive safety de­vices, and in the Elite, adap­tive cruise con­trol with lane-keep­ing as well.</p>
    <p>A grip-bar joins the centre con­sole to the dash on the pas­sen­ger side, giving the driver an ex­clu­sive space at the wheel.</p>
    <p>Stylis­tic grooves run along the length of the fas­cia, link­ing the air­con­di­tion­ing vents. They are de­signed to re­sem­ble the lines of the vents, but do not ex­pect air to come out of them.</p>
    <p>On this front, airflow from the driver’s side vent is weak, some­what im­peded by a de­sign el­e­ment which mim­ics an ex­ten­sion of the in­stru­men­ta­tion screen. This is not a huge is­sue, since the car’s cli­mate con­trol is ad­e­quate and the Elite vari­ant comes with ven­ti­lated seats.</p>
    <p>In the Elite, a dual-tone in­te­rior which in­cor­po­rates a classy fab­ric trim looks re­ally good, too.</p>
    <p>You will find a mod­er­ately high level of fit and fin­ish on both vari­ants. But there is no es­cap­ing hard plas­tics and noise from stowed items in the boot when the car goes over ruts.</p>
    <p>Lined up against its ri­vals, the Avante is a se­ri­ous Corolla chal­lenger and al­most on a par with the Mazda 3.</p>
