    <p>As a mil­len­nial born in the early 1990s, I be­long to the last of the “in-be­tween gen­er­a­tions” that strad­dle the be­fore and after years of rapid tech­no­log­i­cal change.</p>
    <p>We are old enough to re­mem­ber a world of pagers, fax ma­chines and dial-up In­ter­net, un­like Gen­er­a­tion Z, who were born into the In­ter­net age from the late 1990s.</p>
    <p>But we also grew up with smart­phones and so­cial me­dia and func­tion as dig­i­tal na­tives, un­like baby boomers or mem­bers of Gen­er­a­tion X who took to these tools when they were adults.</p>
    <p>Be­ing an early adopter of so­cial me­dia, how­ever, came with risks. While we were more pro­fi­cient in the use of these tools, we were also the first to learn that so­cial me­dia can come with far-reach­ing con­se­quences.</p>
    <p>I have seen up close how the In­ter­net evolved, how it can take over your life, and have learnt some tricks on how to deal with its po­ten­tial pit­falls.</p>
    <p>In the old days, on­line me­dia was a niche plat­form, with few users, and con­ducive to shar­ing pri­vate thoughts and feel­ings within a closed cir­cle. In 2001, when I was nine, I started us­ing MSN Mes­sen­ger to talk to my pri­mary school friends. Two years later, I started my first blog. Then came so­cial net­work­ing plat­forms such as Friend­ster and MyS­pace.</p>
    <p>In 2008, I set up my first Face­book ac­count. My best friend and I fre­quently wrote on each other’s Face­book walls, com­fort­ing each other on bad days, or rant­ing about a dis­as­ter dur­ing an in­tern­ship. These pub­lic posts could be viewed by our friends on Face­book – but who cared about that when you had fewer than 100 friends on the plat­form, and most peo­ple spent less than an hour a week on it. Then so­cial me­dia took off.</p>
    <p>From be­ing a niche plat­form for a small, closed group of peo­ple who mostly knew one an­other, so­cial me­dia net­works such as Face­book and Twit­ter have be­come plat­forms for the masses to con­nect not only with fam­ily and friends, but with other or­gan­i­sa­tions, po­lit­i­cal groups and even ad­ver­tis­ers.</p>
    <p>From about 100 mil­lion ac­tive users in 2008, Face­book now has 2.7 bil­lion users. Peo­ple have also be­come more savvy in how they use and ex­tract value from so­cial me­dia net­works. Now, you can also buy a house, set up a shop or even run a po­lit­i­cal cam­paign via Face­book.</p>
    <p>Con­se­quently, the line be­tween what is per­sonal and what is pub­lic has also blurred, which raises the stakes on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Now, Face­book is no longer a place re­stricted to peo­ple who are close to you.</p>
    <p>My Face­book friends in­clude bosses, col­leagues, work con­tacts and even peo­ple I hardly know – which means that ev­ery sin­gle post I ap­pear in could po­ten­tially be seen by thou­sands of peo­ple.</p>
    <p>To draw a clearer line be­tween what is pri­vate and pub­lic, I now post se­lec­tively, or share my posts only with close friends.</p>
    <p>An­other change in so­cial me­dia I’ve seen up close is the rise of</p>
    <p>From be­ing a niche plat­form for a small, closed group of peo­ple, so­cial me­dia net­works have be­come places for the masses to con­nect not only with fam­ily and friends, but with or­gan­i­sa­tions and even ad­ver­tis­ers.</p>
    <p>on­line vig­i­lan­tism which has given rise to doxxing or the ha­rass­ment of peo­ple on­line by pub­lish­ing their per­sonal in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, an em­ployer who took to Face­book to share his gripes about mil­len­nial job-seek­ers ended up get­ting doxxed by an­gry ne­ti­zens after his post went vi­ral. It de­scribed his ex­pe­ri­ences in­ter­view­ing seven can­di­dates for a po­si­tion, and he chided young peo­ple, say­ing they were “not hun­gry for a job” amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>One can­di­date had said the work­place was too far away and asked for a trans­port al­lowance, while an­other made a re­quest for a</p>
    <p>team of ju­nior staff to help him with his work.</p>
    <p>While many read­ers of the em­ployer’s post agreed with his views, oth­ers felt out­raged by his com­ments which painted younger job-seek­ers as be­ing en­ti­tled, or made him sound like an ar­ro­gant boss. His per­sonal de­tails, in­clud­ing his res­i­den­tial ad­dress, were cir­cu­lated on an on­line fo­rum.</p>
    <p>Doxxing is now a crime in Sin­ga­pore, after changes to the law this year, and a po­lice re­port can be made if you are a vic­tim of doxxing.</p>
    <p>But this does not mean it can be kept com­pletely at bay, so you should also re­frain from re­veal­ing in­for­ma­tion about your per­sonal iden­tity, such as your tele­phone num­ber or where you live, on In­ter­net plat­forms.</p>
    <p>A third trend of so­cial me­dia not present a decade ago is how feel­ings of in­se­cu­rity now breed faster on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>You are now ex­posed to minute-by-minute in­stan­ta­neous re­plays of other peo­ple’s lives on In­sta­gram or TikTok.</p>
    <p>Though this does not af­fect me as much, given that I am older and more ma­ture now, a few friends who work with youth tell me that this in­ten­si­fied, “live” ex­po­sure to the so­cial lives of oth­ers has af­fected the men­tal health of some teenagers.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause the heav­ily staged and edited na­ture of such posts sets un­re­al­is­tic ex­pec­ta­tions of what a nor­mal life should look like, which then af­fects the self-es­teem of young peo­ple when they com­pare their re­al­i­ties with what is seen on­line.</p>
    <p>I now have a more am­biva­lent re­la­tion­ship with these plat­forms.</p>
    <p>On the one hand, the main­stream na­ture of so­cial me­dia helps raise aware­ness of so­cial is­sues, and al­lows more di­verse view­points to en­ter the pub­lic sphere.</p>
    <p>But on the other hand, this re­quires users to spend time and ef­fort fil­ter­ing through the noise on so­cial me­dia, or at­tempt­ing to en­gage peo­ple on plat­forms that could be sub­ject to pub­lic scru­tiny, which can cause burnout or im­age fa­tigue.</p>
    <p>A key take­away is to draw bound­aries for my­self.</p>
    <p>Just as how ex­perts are now ad­vis­ing those work­ing from home to carve out sep­a­rate work and play ar­eas in or­der to safe­guard their men­tal health, I am tak­ing steps to draw the line be­tween what is per­sonal to me, and what can be pub­licly shared with oth­ers.</p>
    <p>So, sto­ries and projects from work will go up on Face­book from time to time, but pho­tos of fam­ily and friends would be largely re­stricted to my pri­vate Google Pho­tos al­bum.</p>
    <p>Set­ting such bound­aries, hope­fully, will al­low me to re­main on so­cial me­dia for decades more to come.</p>
