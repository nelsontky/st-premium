    <p>LON­DON Rafael Nadal re­vealed that he is fresher than usual at the ATP Fi­nals and is ready to play his best today to stop Daniil Medvedev from clinch­ing a maiden vic­tory over him in their fourth meet­ing.</p>
    <p>The Spa­niard’s hopes of win­ning the sea­son-en­der for the first time live on, af­ter he beat de­fend­ing cham­pion Ste­fanos Tsit­si­pas 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The last round-robin match in the Lon­don 2020 Group had be­come a straight knock­out, with both men hav­ing lost to Do­minic Thiem and beaten An­drey Rublev ear­lier in the week. But it was Nadal who al­ways ap­peared the more likely win­ner de­spite a lapse which al­lowed Tsit­si­pas to ex­tend the con­test into a de­cider at a nearde­serted O2 Arena.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a flurry of ser­vice breaks at the start of the third set, he showed all his ex­pe­ri­ence to pull away and reach the semi-fi­nals for the first time in five years.</p>
    <p>“In gen­eral this was a very pos­i­tive match f or me,” said the 34-year-old, who, de­spite win­ning 20 Grand Slam ti­tles, has only two run­ners-up places from his pre­vi­ous nine ap­pear­ances at the ATP Fi­nals. “Ex­cited to be in the semi-fi­nals. It’s al­ways dif­fi­cult to play here against the best play­ers in the world ev­ery sin­gle day, end of the sea­son. Most of the time, you get here a lit­tle bit tired, but this year is a lit­tle bit dif­fer­ent… I hope to be ready to try my best.”</p>
    <p>The Spa­niard, who has won two ti­tles – at Roland Gar­ros and Aca­pulco – in this coro­n­avirus-short­ened sea­son, is chas­ing the big­gest prize miss­ing from his re­sume at the eight-man elite event.</p>
    <p>He has qual­i­fied for the ATP Fi­nals for a record 16 con­sec­u­tive years but has been forced to with­draw on six oc­ca­sions.</p>
    <p>As group run­ner-up be­hind Aus­trian Thiem, he will face Medvedev for a place in the fi­nal, with the Rus­sian al­ready as­sured of top spot in the Tokyo 1970 Group.</p>
    <p>Said Medvedev, who lost to Nadal three times last year, in­clud­ing an ATP Fi­nals de­feat at the round-robin stage and a US Open fi­nal loss: “Of course I want to get a win against Rafa. I still don’t have one.”</p>
