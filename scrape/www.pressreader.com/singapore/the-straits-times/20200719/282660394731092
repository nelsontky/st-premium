    <p>With the largest econ­omy los­ing con­trol of her health pan­demic, a global tragedy is un­fold­ing, with a longer eco­nomic de­pres­sion, ris­ing un­em­ploy­ment, de­clin­ing trade and less and less mon­e­tary and fis­cal space for com­bat­ing the mul­ti­ple crises.</p>
    <p>In his 2016 In­au­gu­ral Ad­dress, United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said: “For too many of our ci­ti­zens, a dif­fer­ent re­al­ity ex­ists: Moth­ers and chil­dren trapped in poverty in our in­ner ci­ties; rusted-out fac­to­ries scat­tered like tomb­stones across the land­scape of our na­tion; an ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beau­ti­ful stu­dents de­prived of knowl­edge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our coun­try of so much un­re­alised po­ten­tial. This</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can car­nage stops right here and stops right now.”</p>
    <p>To stop the car­nage, Trump cut taxes and started the trade war with China.</p>
    <p>With just over four months to the Novem­ber 2020 elec­tions, the trade war has es­ca­lated to fever pitch thus de­scribed by the Chi­nese For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi: “It seems as if ev­ery Chi­nese in­vest­ment is po­lit­i­cally driven, ev­ery Chi­nese stu­dent is a spy and ev­ery co­op­er­a­tion ini­tia­tive is a scheme with a hid­den agenda.”</p>
    <p>How could the strong­est na­tion in the world with the best tech­nol­ogy, med­i­cal and man­age­rial skills have bun­gled the pan­demic such that it could in­cur an es­ti­mated 225,000 deaths by Nov 1?</p>
    <p>The In­sti­tute for Health Met­rics and Eval­u­a­tion model fore­casts the range could vary from a lower level of 200,000 if 95 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion wear masks, ver­sus nearly 300,000 if man­dates are eased (early re-open­ing).</p>
    <p>A range of 200,000 to 300,000 deaths is a car­nage by any def­i­ni­tion. Re­call that the 2001 war on ter­ror was trig­gered by only 2,977 deaths from 9/11. Nine­teen hi­jack­ers sparked Amer­ica’s en­tan­gle­ment in the Mid­dle East that cost US$7 tril­lion (S$9.7 tril­lion), not counting count­less hu­man suf­fer­ing in Iraq, Afghanista­n, Syria, Ye­men and other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>This pan­demic has larger hu­man costs at home and will be emo­tion­ally trau­matic, which is why in­se­cu­rity and fear has made ev­ery­thing po­lit­i­cally charged, not med­i­cal and science-based.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Ron­ald In­gle­hart, di­rec­tor of the World Val­ues Survey, ar­gued “that eco­nomic and phys­i­cal in­se­cu­rity are con­ducive to xeno­pho­bia, strong in-group sol­i­dar­ity, au­thor­i­tar­ian pol­i­tics and rigid ad­her­ence to their group’s tra­di­tional cul­tural norms”.</p>
    <p>This ex­plains why wear­ing a mask in the United States is a po­lit­i­cal is­sue, not a med­i­cal ne­ces­sity.</p>
    <p>The med­i­cal con­se­quences of young peo­ple mix­ing freely with­out wear­ing masks af­ter Me­mo­rial Day as if they are im­mune to Covid-19 are now ev­i­dent, with crowded hos­pi­tals and fur­ther lock­downs, de­lay­ing any eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>With the largest econ­omy los­ing con­trol of her health pan­demic, a global tragedy is un­fold­ing, with a longer eco­nomic de­pres­sion, ris­ing un­em­ploy­ment, de­clin­ing trade and less and less mon­e­tary and fis­cal space for com­bat­ing the mul­ti­ple crises.</p>
    <p>Re­al­is­ti­cally, ra­tio­nal so­lu­tions and poli­cies can­not work when ev­ery­one is blinded by the grow­ing emo­tional trauma from the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>There is no ra­tio­nal so­lu­tion when both sides are po­larised by deep emo­tion on a wide range of cul­tural and po­lit­i­cal val­ues.</p>
    <p>The once-in-a-cen­tury pan­demic has wo­ken us to the pri­mal fear that sur­vival is pre­car­i­ous. The re­sponse is emo­tional, not ra­tio­nal.</p>
    <p>First, the pan­demic and re­ces­sion is a global prob­lem that can­not be solved by any sin­gle na­tion.</p>
    <p>No global con­sen­sus can be achieved when US-China ten­sions are at their worst for years.</p>
    <p>In ev­ery na­tion, there is huge po­lar­i­sa­tion on many do­mes­tic is­sues ex­cept blam­ing out­siders and for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, many do­mes­tic griev­ances stem from glob­al­i­sa­tion ef­fects.</p>
    <p>For years, the com­bi­na­tion of tech­nol­ogy and push for global sup­ply chains has cut mid­dle-class jobs in rich coun­tries. In­stead of ad­dress­ing their con­cerns, the stan­dard pol­icy so­lu­tion was to cut taxes for the rich and in­crease wel­fare for the un­der-priv­i­leged. So the mid­dle class feels that they pay most of the taxes, get none of the ben­e­fits and less and less security on jobs. Lit­tle won­der the de­mand for pop­ulist change.</p>
    <p>Third, whilst tech­nol­ogy and bet­ter man­age­ment/gov­er­nance us­ing Big Data and Ar­ti­fi­cial In­tel­li­gence is the right way for­ward, tech­nol­ogy has wors­ened the so­cial di­vide be­cause of win­ner-take-all ef­fects.</p>
    <p>The West can­not al­low Huawei to win on 5G, be­cause they would lose both the prod­ucts, busi­ness and jobs from the 5G spin-offs.</p>
    <p>Bet­ter on­line tech ac­tu­ally de­stroys many off-line jobs, with huge costs in­volved in re­train­ing and re-skilling the work force.</p>
    <p>All these point to dom­i­nant Big Gov­ern­ment and Big Tech in the Post-Covid world.</p>
    <p>Who and how to man­age Big Gov­ern­ment and Big Tech to de­liver bet­ter health, good jobs, bal­ance with na­ture, and world peace is the core con­cern.</p>
    <p>But po­lar­i­sa­tion of views along race, reli­gion, cul­ture, class and gen­er­a­tion means that the strug­gle is be­com­ing more stri­dent and emo­tional, bor­der­ing on vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>The op­tions for man­ag­ing the com­plex and chaotic world ac­tu­ally are to fight, co­op­er­ate or take flight.</p>
    <p>Flight is get­ting more dif­fi­cult in a crowded world where the rich economies are clos­ing their bor­ders.</p>
    <p>The real worry is that govern­ments will want to use the fear and fight fac­tor to es­ca­late the arms race, bring­ing us all closer to nu­clear Ar­maged­don.</p>
    <p>Global co­op­er­a­tion is the ra­tio­nal op­tion, but can­not be achieved with the huge emo­tional at­tacks on ev­ery­one who has a dif­fer­ent view, invit­ing re­tal­i­a­tion and fur­ther es­ca­la­tion of ten­sions. In other words, ra­tio­nal or sci­en­tific views can­not pre­vail when ev­ery­one is emo­tion­ally trau­ma­tised.</p>
    <p>This is why Amer­i­can car­nage is a real global tragedy. Na­tional security is tak­ing prece­dence over eco­nomic logic. When the lead­ing econ­omy and mil­i­tary power is feel­ing vul­ner­a­ble and inse­cure, there can be no global peace.</p>
    <p>Those out­side the United States know that in the run-up to the Novem­ber pres­i­den­tial elec­tions, emo­tions will con­tinue to run high every­where. Bri­tish poet Rud­yard Ki­pling (1865-1936) summed it up: “If you can keep your head when all about you are los­ing theirs and blam­ing it on you… And so hold on when there is noth­ing in you</p>
    <p>Ex­cept the Will which says to them: “Hold On”.</p>
    <p>In these times, hold­ing on is also a vic­tory. We need cool heads and warm hearts to hold on, not hot heads and burn­ing lungs.</p>
