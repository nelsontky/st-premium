    <p>Malaysian ac­tress Yeo Yann Yann has been nom­i­nated for an In­ter­na­tional Emmy Award for her role in the HBO Asia orig­i­nal In­vis­i­ble Sto­ries – a six-part se­ries cre­ated by home-grown di­rec­tor Ler Jiyuan.</p>
    <p>The 43-year-old, known for her Golden Horse Award-win­ning roles in lo­cal di­rec­tor Anthony Chen’s films Ilo Ilo (2013) and Wet Sea­son (2019), was nom­i­nated for Best Per­for­mance by an Ac­tress. She played Lian, a single mother car­ing for her 19-year-old son who dis­plays ag­gres­sive be­hav­iour fol­low­ing the death of his grand­mother.</p>
    <p>In­vis­i­ble Sto­ries, set in a fic­tional HDB es­tate, is shot en­tirely on lo­ca­tion in Sin­ga­pore and delves into the un­told sto­ries of the Sin­ga­porean heart­land-dweller. It is avail­able to stream on HBO Go.</p>
    <p>Yeo posted about the news on her In­sta­gram ac­count and wrote: “What ex­cit­ing news!”</p>
    <p>The nom­i­na­tions were an­nounced in New York on Thurs­day by the In­ter­na­tional Academy of Tele­vi­sion Arts & Sci­ences. The sec­ond sea­son of Sin­ga­porean film-maker Leon Cheo’s Peo­ple Like Us is in the run­ning for Best Short-form Se­ries.</p>
    <p>The show fol­lows the jour­ney of four gay men liv­ing in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Cheo said in a Face­book post: “A first for Sin­ga­pore in the cat­e­gory. I am happy that the se­ries has struck a chord with the judges at the In­ter­na­tional Em­mys.”</p>
    <p>The com­edy se­ries Fam! was nom­i­nated in the com­edy cat­e­gory in last year’s In­ter­na­tional Emmy Awards, but did not win.</p>
    <p>The win­ners of the awards will be an­nounced in a cer­e­mony pro­duced from New York City on Nov 23.</p>
