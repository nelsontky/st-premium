    <p>• Aus­tralian di­rec­tor Rod­er­ick MacKay (left) braved Covid-19 re­stric­tions to make a “daunt­ing” trip to the Venice Film Fes­ti­val in Italy, where his de­but fea­ture The Fur­nace pre­miered last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>MacKay, 33, had to get per­mis­sion from the Aus­tralian au­thor­i­ties to leave his own coun­try, quar­an­tine in Rome for two weeks be­fore trav­el­ling to Venice, and will have to quar­an­tine again when he goes back to Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>“Trav­el­ling dur­ing this time in his­tory is sort of just a lit­tle bit daunt­ing for any pur­pose,” MacKay, who filmed a video of his jour­ney and self-iso­la­tion on his mo­bile for Reuters, said in an in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>“But to be do­ing so, to come to a top-tier fes­ti­val like Venice, to have your de­but film pre­miere on the world stage, it’s cer­tainly a whole other layer of daunt­ing­ness,” he said, adding he was happy and hon­oured to be at the world’s old­est film fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>The Fur­nace, which is in the Hori­zon sec­tion out­side the main com­pe­ti­tion, tells the lit­tle-known story of cameleers brought to Aus­tralia by the Bri­tish em­pire from In­dia, Afghanista­n and Per­sia in the sec­ond half of the 19th cen­tury and the lo­cal Abo­rig­i­nal peo­ple they be­friended.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, The Crown (2016 to present) star Vanessa Kirby said last Sat­ur­day that her lat­est role as a woman who loses her child af­ter a home birth goes wrong was her scari­est yet. The Bri­tish ac­tress plays along­side Hol­ly­wood star Shia LaBeouf in Pieces Of A Woman, which is pre­mier­ing at the fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>It opens with a 25-minute-long birth scene which was shot in one take by Hun­gar­ian di­rec­tor Kor­nel Mun­druczo and writ­ten by his long-time part­ner Kata We­ber.</p>
    <p>The film is one of a se­ries of deeply per­sonal films com­pet­ing for the Golden Lion top prize.</p>
    <p>Kirby, 32, said try­ing to be true to the suf­fer­ing of the women she talked to be­fore the shoot was “re­ally scary”.</p>
    <p>But she threw her­self “re­ally deep” into her first lead role in a movie in a way she had not done since she made her name play­ing Princess Mar­garet, sis­ter of Bri­tain’s El­iz­a­beth II, in the hit Net­flix se­ries.</p>
    <p>An­other movie mak­ing head­lines at Venice is the retro Bri­tish com­edy The Duke, with crit­ics last Sat­ur­day heap­ing praise on its stars He­len Mir­ren and Jim Broad­bent.</p>
    <p>The yarn is based on the strangerth­an-fic­tion true story of a dis­abled New­cas­tle pen­sioner called Kemp­ton Bun­ton, played by Broad­bent.</p>
    <p>Bun­ton al­legedly stole Span­ish pain­ter Fran­cisco Goya’s paint­ing of the Duke of Welling­ton, the vic­tor of the Bat­tle of Water­loo, from Lon­don’s Na­tional Gallery in 1961.</p>
    <p>Mir­ren, who won a Best Ac­tress Os­car for The Queen (2006), is his crotch­ety clean­ing-lady wife Dolly, who tries to rein in his mad­der schemes and so­cial cam­paign­ing.</p>
    <p>The Duke’s di­rec­tor Roger Michell, best known for Not­ting Hill (1999), said Bun­ton – whose fam­ily was con­sulted by the pro­duc­ers – was a rogue in the best Bri­tish ec­cen­tric tra­di­tion, some­one driven by a Robin Hood sense of jus­tice.</p>
    <p>“It’s about a small man who stands up and speaks truth to power,” the South Africa-born di­rec­tor said.</p>
