    <p>BER­LIN • The head of the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) has called for global sol­i­dar­ity in the roll­out of any fu­ture coron­avirus vac­cine, as the num­ber of cases soared across the world.</p>
    <p>In a video ad­dress at the open­ing of the three-day World Health Sum­mit in Ber­lin on Sun­day, Dr Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus said the only way to re­cover from the pan­demic was by work­ing to­gether and mak­ing sure poorer coun­tries had fair ac­cess to a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>“It is nat­u­ral that coun­tries want to pro­tect their own ci­ti­zens first but if and when we have an ef­fec­tive vac­cine, we must also use it ef­fec­tively. And the best way to do that is to vac­ci­nate some peo­ple in all coun­tries rather than all peo­ple in some coun­tries,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Let me be clear, vac­cine na­tion­al­ism will pro­long the pan­demic, not shorten it.”</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists around the world are rac­ing to de­velop a vac­cine against Covid-19, which has killed more than 1.1 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral dozen vac­cine can­di­dates are be­ing tested in clin­i­cal tri­als, 10 of which are in the most ad­vanced phase 3 stage in­volv­ing tens of thou­sands of vol­un­teers.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish drug maker As­traZeneca, which is de­vel­op­ing a Covid-19 vac­cine with Ox­ford Univer­sity re­searchers, is seen as one of the front run­ners in the race.</p>
    <p>As­traZeneca said yes­ter­day that its Covid-19 vac­cine pro­duces a ro­bust im­mune re­sponse in el­derly peo­ple and young peo­ple and that ad­verse re­ac­tions were lower among the el­derly.</p>
    <p>The Fi­nan­cial Times re­ported that the vac­cine trig­gers pro­tec­tive an­ti­bod­ies and T-cells in older age groups. The news­pa­per cited two peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the find­ing.</p>
    <p>Im­muno­genic­ity blood tests car­ried out on a sub­set of older par­tic­i­pants echo data re­leased in July which showed the vac­cine gen­er­ated “ro­bust im­mune re­sponses” in a group of healthy adults aged be­tween 18 and 55, the Bri­tish news­pa­per re­ported.</p>
    <p>“It is en­cour­ag­ing to see that im­muno­genic­ity re­sponses were sim­i­lar be­tween older and younger adults and that re­ac­to­genic­ity was lower in older adults, where the Covid-19 dis­ease sever­ity is higher,” an As­traZeneca spokesman told Reuters.</p>
    <p>“The re­sults fur­ther build the body of ev­i­dence for the safety and im­muno­genic­ity of AZD1222,” the spokesman added, re­fer­ring to the tech­ni­cal name of the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The news that older peo­ple get an im­mune re­sponse from the vac­cine is pos­i­tive be­cause the im­mune sys­tem weak­ens with age and older peo­ple are those most at risk of dy­ing from the virus.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Is­rael has said it will be­gin its first clin­i­cal tri­als of a coron­avirus vac­cine next month, as the coun­try grap­ples with a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Early in the pan­demic, Prime Min­is­ter Ben­jamin Ne­tanyahu tasked the Is­rael Institute for Bi­o­log­i­cal Re­search (IIBR) with de­vel­op­ing a vac­cine against the virus.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has killed over 2,370 peo­ple in the Jewish state since the start of the out­break there, and has in­fected more than 300,000, ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cial fig­ures.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, the Is­raeli au­thor­i­ties an­nounced that the first clin­i­cal tri­als of the “BriLife” vac­cine would be­gin on Nov 1, as a spokesman for the de­fence min­istry said the “nec­es­sary ap­provals” had been granted.</p>
    <p>The tri­als will be con­ducted over sev­eral months.</p>
    <p>“Our fi­nal goal is 15 mil­lion ra­tions for the res­i­dents of the state of Is­rael and for our close neigh­bours,” IIBR head Shmuel Shapira was quoted as say­ing in a state­ment.</p>
