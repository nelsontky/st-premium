    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Girl may not be aloft in the skies these days. But she – and her male col­leagues – are fly­ing high in this dis­tressed job mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Many cabin crew un­der the Sin­ga­pore Air­lines Group are land­ing good sec­ond­ment gigs and sec­ond ca­reers with their im­pec­ca­ble groom­ing, well-honed cus­tomer care skills and knack for han­dling tricky sit­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Since the Covid-19 pan­demic grounded air­planes and closed bor­ders, many of them have been re­de­ployed to a va­ri­ety of roles, es­pe­cially in the ser­vice in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Since April, the group has de­ployed around 850 care am­bas­sadors in hos­pi­tals, 500 trans­port am­bas­sadors at trans­port hubs, such as bus in­ter­changes, and 170 con­tact trac­ing am­bas­sadors.</p>
    <p>There are oth­ers who are work­ing as safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors.</p>
    <p>Mr Hanif Af­fandi, 31, a cabin crew com­plex leader with low-cost car­rier Scoot, has worked in both a hospi­tal and a gov­ern­ment min­istry this year.</p>
    <p>From mid-June to end-Au­gust, he was a care am­bas­sador at Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hospi­tal (SGH), where his re­spon­si­bil­i­ties in­cluded as­sist­ing nurses with am­bu­lat­ing pa­tients, daily house­keep­ing and serv­ing pa­tients their food.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing that time, the Sin­ga­porean was praised for be­ing help­ful, cheer­ful and pro­fes­sional. He ad­dressed pa­tients by name and en­sured that ev­ery­one was promptly at­tended to.</p>
    <p>“His at­ten­tion to de­tail was very much ap­pre­ci­ated and I hope he can in­spire his fel­low Scootees to be a world-class cabin crew like him,” wrote Mr Les­lie Ong, a se­nior staff nurse at SGH, in a ci­ta­tion letter about him.</p>
    <p>Re­call­ing his ex­pe­ri­ence work­ing in a hospi­tal, Mr Hanif says his favourite part was chat­ting with pa­tients, just like he used to chat with pas­sen­gers on flights.</p>
    <p>“Ser­vice ex­cel­lence was a core part of our crew train­ing, and it helped me ease into these pub­lic­fac­ing roles which re­quire pro­fes­sion­al­ism and good ser­vice skills.”</p>
    <p>Since Septem­ber, Mr Hanif has been work­ing at the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment (MSF) as a cus­tomer ser­vice of­fi­cer, an­swer­ing queries from the pub­lic on the Covid-19 Sup­port Grant, which helps Sin­ga­porean cit­i­zens and per­ma­nent res­i­dents who are un­em­ployed, put on no­pay leave, or suf­fered sig­nif­i­cant in­come loss as a re­sult of the eco­nomic im­pact of Covid-19, as well as other av­enues of sup­port.</p>
    <p>An­other cabin crew work­ing at MSF is Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) lead­ing stew­ard Adrian Ang, 39, who is help­ing to ad­min­is­ter the grant.</p>
    <p>He, too, uses ac­tive lis­ten­ing and peo­ple man­age­ment skills, which he honed from his train­ing at SIA.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, when faced with an an­gry ap­pli­cant who was re­jected twice and was threat­en­ing to lobby his Mem­ber of Par­lia­ment, Mr Ang calmly heard him out.</p>
    <p>He found out that the ap­pli­cant had sim­ply for­got­ten to sub­mit his lat­est payslip and shed clar­ity on what was needed to process the ap­pli­ca­tion. At the end of the call, the ap­pli­cant thanked Mr Ang pro­fusely.</p>
    <p>His col­league, Ms Lee Yin Hui, 42, an SIA lead­ing stew­ardess, is on a five-month sec­ond­ment with the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Author­ity (BCA) as a cus­tomer re­la­tions ex­ec­u­tive. She an­swers calls on the BCA hot­line and replies to e-mails from em­ploy­ers, con­trac­tors and for­eign work­ers, among other tasks.</p>
    <p>One of the skills that has proved trans­fer­able from her fly­ing days is cus­tomer care, which has en­abled her to pro­vide a sym­pa­thetic lis­ten­ing ear.</p>
    <p>She re­cently an­swered a phone call from a woman who wanted to leave ver­bal feed­back about her con­do­minium man­age­ment, in­stead of writ­ing in, as is pro­to­col.</p>
    <p>But Ms Lee’s ex­pe­ri­ence at SIA taught her to recog­nise that the caller mainly wanted some­one to lis­ten and em­pathise with her.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee says: “So I kept quiet and lis­tened, and showed her that I un­der­stood what she was go­ing through and how her sit­u­a­tion was af­fect­ing her.”</p>
    <p>A few days later, the woman called back to say the mat­ter had been duly re­solved with help from BCA, and thanked Ms Lee for tak­ing the time to lis­ten to her.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee says: “It felt very grat­i­fy­ing to know that I had helped to make some­one’s day bet­ter. ”</p>
