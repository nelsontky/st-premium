    <p>Strong women who con­trib­uted to na­tion build­ing are the in­spi­ra­tion for Sin­ga­porean de­signer Ade­lyn Putri’s five looks for Sin­ga­pore Sto­ries.</p>
    <p>They are the sam­sui woman, the first fe­male mata-mata (Malay street slang for po­lice­women) of the 1950s and Che Za­hara, a Malay ac­tivist who fought for women and chil­dren’s rights in 1940s Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Putri, who is be­hind wom­enswear la­bel Nude Femme, reimag­ined these women of Sin­ga­pore’s his­tory as “evolved” for to­day’s so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the labour­ing sam­sui woman is to­day an ar­chi­tect or work­ing in the con­struc­tion sec­tor. Putri turned the women’s iconic red head­dress into a bag – an un­ex­pect­edly apt sar­to­rial de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>“When I was do­ing re­search, I found that they used the head­dress to keep money back then,” says the 40-year-old de­signer.</p>
    <p>“My phi­los­o­phy was to take these three fe­male icons rep­re­sent­ing the multi-cul­tural com­mu­ni­ties of Sin­ga­pore and evolve them into mod­ern looks. These women had very strong core val­ues, which I feel are still rel­e­vant to­day.”</p>
    <p>To make the out­fits wear­able, she tweaked cuts and fab­rics while re­tain­ing key de­tails.</p>
    <p>The “starchy or boxy” fit of the po­lice­women’s uni­form, for ex­am­ple, was given a com­fort­able twist with soft ten­cel fab­ric. She turned their stiff berets into a bag.</p>
    <p>The com­pe­ti­tion came at an op­por­tune time for Putri, who had to pause her usual sched­ule of fash­ion weeks around the re­gion due to the pandemic.</p>
    <p>She also felt that the theme was aligned with her brand, which is of­ten inspired by women of his­tory.</p>
    <p>Not­ing greater pub­lic in­ter­est in all things lo­cal, she is hope­ful about the fu­ture of fash­ion here.</p>
    <p>“There’s no bet­ter time than now to lever­age lo­cal, in­de­pen­dent la­bels.”</p>
