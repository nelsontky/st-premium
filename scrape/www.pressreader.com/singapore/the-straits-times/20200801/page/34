        THE STRAITS TIMES B6 SATURDAY, AUGUST 1, 2020 | | | A TRIBUTE TO NURSES This special feature is also available @ www.stjobs.sg/explore-careers Being A Nurse Means... Singapore celebrates Nurses’ Day today. Four nurses share core values of their profession and what they love about their job. BY GEL CABOTAJE …Using My Skills And Knowledge To Help Others …Making A
Dif ference, One Patient At A Time Nursing (Top-up) programme, awarded by Edinburgh Napier University, UK.
Although she began her coursework at MDIS only this year, Ms Law says she has already picked up some valuable lessons. “The lectures by overseas lecturers have opened my eyes to potential alternativ­es in critical thinking or treatment options when caring for a patient,” she says.
“Sometimes, all that a patient needs is just a listening ear, to have someone whom they can                                                                      concerns and worries, or a pat on the shoulder to calm and encourage them.”
She says nurses should give their best when caring for their patients: “We should not be daunted by the challenges that we may face at work. It is import                                                              - edge that we are doing what matters to make a difference, and that we have done our best.” Now 29 and a senior staff nurse at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, she is glad to be able to help others in a similar situation.
Ms Law develops and implements nursing care plans for patients in the inpatient ward, which include patient and family education, and ensures that the needs of every patient are met. She juggles work with part-time studies at the Management Developmen­t Institute of Singapore (MDIS), where she is pursuing the Bachelor of Science, Ms Joelle Yap, 47, has been in the nursing profession for more than two decades, taking on many roles including as an accident and emergency (A&E) nurse and a medical mission volunteer.
Ms Yap became interested in education and disaster relief during her eight years as an A&E nurse at Singapore General Hospital. She left the hospital in 2002 to focus on internatio­nal relief efforts and post-disaster developmen­t projects.
She has volunteere­d for relief missions such as the one after the 2001 Gujarat earthquake and also following the 2019 Typhoon Hagibis in Japan, as well as re-developmen­t projects in north-east Japan following the 2011 tsunami, among others.
Asked why she does volunteer work, she says: “There is so much to do beyond the classroom and the clinical setting. I feel that if I have the gift and calling to help others, I should use it. When I hear about the needs of people, I can’t just sit still. I will want to help since I have the time, skills and knowledge to.”
Ms Yap holds three master’s degrees, one of which is a Master’s of Health Services Management degree from Curtin University of Technology, Australia. “There, I learnt the importance of having an enquiring mind — to Ms Julia Law knows how it feels to be a caregiver: A family member is born with cerebral palsy and requires round-theclock care.
“I know how stressful it can be for caregivers, even more so if their loved ones are admitted to hospital. I would like to assure them they do not have to worry while their loved ones are under our care.” Joelle Yap challenge what is presented to us and to look for evidence to back up what we say,” she says.
Today, Ms Yap is passing on her knowledge to future healthcare profession­als as a local facilitato­r at Curtin Singapore for Health Sciences.
She says: “I hope to impart to the next generation the importance of lifelong learning. They should not stop learning when my classes are over. If they have that                                                                      led to challenge themselves to do more and to become an advocate to others.” 47, a local facilitato­r at Curtin Singapore for Health Sciences “I hope to impart to the next generation the importance of lifelong learning. They should not stop learning when my classes are over. If they have that reflective mindset, they will be led to challenge themselves to do more and to become an advocate to others.” Julia Law 29, senior staff nurse at
Ng Teng Fong General Hospital “I know how stressful it can be for caregivers, even more so if their loved ones are admitted to hospital. I would like to assure them they do not have to worry while their loved ones are under our care.” PRINTED AND DISTRIBUTE­D BY PRESSREADE­R PressReade­r.com +1 604 278 4604 ORIGINAL COPY .
