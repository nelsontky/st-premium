    <p>A se­ries of storms buf­fet­ing Viet­nam this month, claim­ing the lives of 130 peo­ple and leav­ing dozens miss­ing so far, has un­der­scored the added com­plex­ity of re­spond­ing to dis­as­ters dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ty­phoon Molave, pack­ing winds of 125kmh, is the fourth big storm to hit the coun­try’s cen­tral prov­inces this month, fur­ther im­mis­er­at­ing the 800,000 peo­ple al­ready af­fected by flood­ing in the re­gion, as well as in Cam­bo­dia and Laos.</p>
    <p>In such emer­gen­cies, teams of lo­gis­tics and com­mu­ni­ca­tions spe­cial­ists would nor­mally be dis­patched from neigh­bour­ing coun­tries to help pave the way for the de­liv­ery of sup­plies, and search and res­cue mis­sions. This time, ow­ing to the pan­demic, Viet­namese of­fi­cials have de­clined such of­fers of help.</p>
    <p>“Viet­nam made clear that no per­son­nel could come – only items,” said Ms Adelina Ka­mal, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Asean Co­or­di­nat­ing Cen­tre for Hu­man­i­tar­ian As­sis­tance on Dis­as­ter Man­age­ment, bet­ter known as the AHA Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>To be sure, Viet­nam has seen worse and may be able to man­age the dis­as­ter it­self, with or with­out a pan­demic. In 2017, more than a dozen storms trig­gered floods and land­slides that claimed nearly 400 lives and caused the equiv­a­lent of $3.5 bil­lion in dam­age.</p>
    <p>Last week, the AHA Cen­tre ar­ranged the air­lift of 1,300 kitchen sets, con­sist­ing of uten­sils for cook­ing and meals, from Subang, Malaysia, the lo­ca­tion of one of three Asean re­gional stock­piles. But none of the more than 320-strong Emer­gency Rapid Assess­ment Team who were al­ready out­side Viet­nam were per­mit­ted to en­ter.</p>
    <p>As Covid-19 threat­ens to drag on for many more months, emer­gency re­sponse of­fi­cials will need to rely more on lo­cal tal­ent if the pan­demic de­ters the ar­rival of help from over­seas.</p>
    <p>There could be a re­peat of re­cent years that saw mul­ti­ple large-scale dis­as­ters, at a time when dis­as­ter mit­i­ga­tion of­fi­cials may al­ready be dis­tracted with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Dam­age caused by storms and ty­phoons in the western Pa­cific in 2018, in­clud­ing Ty­phoon Mangkhut which claimed over 130 lives in the Philip­pines and China, set a record of US$30.2 bil­lion that year, only to be bested by the dam­age fig­ure the fol­low­ing year which topped US$34 bil­lion (S$46 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>More than 4,300 lost their lives in earth­quakes and tsunamis that stuck In­done­sia’s Cen­tral Su­lawesi in Septem­ber 2018. Ms Adelina re­calls daily morn­ing meet­ings in Ba­lik­pa­pan, East Kal­i­man­tan to plan air­lifts us­ing mil­i­tary air­craft to ferry sup­plies to vic­tims. “With­out phys­i­cal co­or­di­na­tion, if we have mul­ti­ple dis­as­ters like in 2018, it’s go­ing to be dif­fi­cult,” she said.</p>
    <p>Flood­ing in Viet­nam notwith­stand­ing, this year has been quiet. The air­lift to Viet­nam this month was AHA Cen­tre’s first for a nat­u­ral dis­as­ter since the on­set of the pan­demic in March, Ms Adelina said.</p>
    <p>The AHA Cen­tre was es­tab­lished in 2011. By now, teams there have notched up suf­fi­cient ex­pe­ri­ence and fa­mil­iar­ity to cope with lim­i­ta­tions stem­ming from the pan­demic, said Ms Adelina, stressing the need for prepa­ra­tion to deal with dis­as­ters. “We have to start the plan­ning from now on,” she said. “Peo­ple may have been clouded by Covid-19. Maybe they are pray­ing that there won’t be a dis­as­ter. But we are a dis­as­ter-prone re­gion.”</p>
    <p>Dr Ra­ditya Jati, head of data, in­for­ma­tion and dis­as­ter com­mu­ni­ca­tion at In­done­sia’s Na­tional Dis­as­ter Man­age­ment Agency, said the cen­tral gov­ern­ment is push­ing lo­cal govern­ments to iden­tify pop­u­lated ar­eas prone to flood­ing and land­slides, and tem­po­rary shel­ters that can min­imise crowd­ing.</p>
    <p>Floods in West Jakarta last month were some­thing of a dress re­hearsal of a large-scale dis­as­ter, with of­fi­cials hand­ing out masks and en­forc­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing, which Dr Ra­ditya said pre­vented clus­ters of Covid-19 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>De­ci­sions to ad­mit for­eign emer­gency work­ers re­main on a caseby- case ba­sis, he said. “We are a big coun­try. There is a chal­lenge to ac­cess the whole coun­try.”</p>
