    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Ms Maryanne Trump Barry, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s older sis­ter and a former fed­eral judge, de­scribed him as a liar who has “no prin­ci­ples” in a se­ries of au­dio record­ings made by her niece, Ms Mary Trump, in 2018 and last year.</p>
    <p>The record­ings were pro­vided to The Wash­ing­ton Post, which pub­lished them on­line on Satur­day night. In the record­ing, Ms Barry can be heard dis­parag­ing her brother’s per­for­mance as pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>“His... tweet and the ly­ing, oh, my God,” she says in one of the record­ings posted by the news­pa­per. “I’m talk­ing too freely, but you know. The change of sto­ries. The lack of prepa­ra­tion. The ly­ing.”</p>
    <p>Ms Trump is the au­thor of the re­cently pub­lished book, Too Much And Never Enough: How My Fam­ily Cre­ated The World’s Most Dan­ger­ous Man. In it, she re­counted how the Pres­i­dent’s up­bring­ing turned him into what she called a reck­less leader.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to The Post, Ms Trump se­cretly recorded 15 hours of faceto-face con­ver­sa­tions with Ms Barry about the Pres­i­dent and his up­bring­ing.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment pro­vided by a White House spokesman, Mr Trump dis­missed the ac­cu­sa­tions and re­ferred to the re­cent death of his younger brother, Mr Robert Trump.</p>
    <p>“Every day it’s some­thing else, who cares,” the Pres­i­dent said. “I miss my brother, and I’ll con­tinue to work hard for the Amer­i­can peo­ple. Not ev­ery­one agrees, but the re­sults are ob­vi­ous. Our coun­try will soon be stronger than ever be­fore.”</p>
    <p>Ms Barry, who was ap­pointed to the fed­eral bench by then Pres­i­dent Ron­ald Rea­gan, says in one con­ver­sa­tion that Mr Trump helped her get that ap­point­ment by ask­ing his lawyer, Mr Roy Cohn, to urge Mr Rea­gan to ap­point more fe­male judges.</p>
    <p>Ms Barry says the Pres­i­dent once said to her: “Where would you be with­out me?”</p>
    <p>Ms Barry says she told her younger brother at the time: “You say that one more time and I will level you.” She says she was an­gry that he was try­ing to “take credit” for her ac­com­plish­ments as a judge.</p>
    <p>The Post said that in one con­ver­sa­tion, Ms Barry crit­i­cises the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s pol­icy of sep­a­rat­ing mi­grant chil­dren from their par­ents when they tried to cross the bor­der from Mex­ico.</p>
    <p>“All he wants to do is ap­peal to his base,” Ms Barry tells Ms Trump, ac­cord­ing to the pa­per.</p>
    <p>“He has no prin­ci­ples. None. None. And his base, I mean my God, if you were a re­li­gious per­son, you want to help peo­ple. Not do this.”</p>
    <p>The change of sto­ries. The lack of prepa­ra­tion. The ly­ing. ’’ MS MARYANNE TRUMP BARRY, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s older sis­ter and a former fed­eral judge, about Mr Trump, in record­ings pro­vided to The Wash­ing­ton Post. Ac­cord­ing to The Post, niece Mary Trump se­cretly recorded 15 hours of face-to-face con­ver­sa­tions with Ms Barry about the Pres­i­dent and his up­bring­ing in 2018 and last year.</p>
