    <p>Any dis­cus­sion on race is­sues seems to in­vari­ably po­larise peo­ple into dif­fer­ent camps. We can talk till the cows come home and still not reach com­mon ground as long as we per­sist in hav­ing an “us ver­sus them” men­tal­ity.</p>
    <p>I would sug­gest that the real is­sue we have here is not about race, but rather of val­ues.</p>
    <p>Grow­ing up, a lot of us could be con­sid­ered race-blind. We prob­a­bly had neigh­bours of dif­fer­ent races, but we were friends be­cause we un­der­stood only a com­mon lan­guage called “fun”. Race was hardly a fac­tor in mak­ing a friend or avoid­ing one.</p>
    <p>We learnt val­ues such as mu­tual re­spect and kind­ness sim­ply from our fre­quent in­ter­ac­tions with one an­other. Treat­ing one an­other nicely and with dig­nity were val­ues our par­ents taught us since we were young.</p>

    <p>• con­sen­sus, not con­flict; and • racial and re­li­gious har­mony.</p>
    <p>Per­haps it is time we re­vis­ited these na­tion­ally shared val­ues to see if we have made head­way with them. Henry Lee</p>
