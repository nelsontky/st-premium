    <p>BENGALURU • There is a high risk the resur­gence in coro­n­avirus cases halts the global eco­nomic re­cov­ery by year end, ac­cord­ing to Reuters polls of around 500 economists, a ma­jor­ity of whom ex­pected the re­bound next year to be weaker than pre­vi­ously thought.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ments and cen­tral banks around the world have pledged tril­lions of dol­lars of stim­u­lus, help­ing most economies out of deep re­ces­sions. But a se­cond wave of in­fec­tions in places that eased lock­downs is now un­der way, lead­ing to more re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>The Oct 6-Oct 27 Reuters polls of economists across Asia, Europe and the Amer­i­cas, cov­er­ing 46 economies, showed scant sign of ac­tiv­ity re­cov­er­ing to pre-Covid-19 lev­els any­time soon.</p>
    <p>Nearly three-quar­ters of 150 an­a­lysts who re­sponded to an ad­di­tional ques­tion said the resur­gence in virus cases posed a high risk of halt­ing the cur­rent global eco­nomic re­cov­ery as early as this year.</p>
    <p>“Even be­fore the re­newed lock­downs, there was al­ready a broad ac­cep­tance that many coun­tries will see a per­ma­nently lower level of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct than they would have done in the ab­sence of the pan­demic,” said Ms Janet Henry, global chief econ­o­mist at HSBC.</p>
    <p>“Higher un­em­ploy­ment and higher debt ap­pear in­evitable, but there are also im­pli­ca­tions for equal­ity, long-term growth po­ten­tial and fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity.”</p>
    <p>Me­dian growth fore­casts for over 65 per cent of those 46 economies were down­graded or left un­changed for this year and nearly 60 per cent of those for next year. The range of fore­casts also re­veals mostly lower lows and lower highs.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, there is no sign of the pan­demic letting up any­time soon.</p>
    <p>The United States, Rus­sia, France and many other coun­tries have reg­is­tered record num­bers of cases in re­cent days, and Euro­pean gov­ern­ments in­tro­duced new curbs.</p>
    <p>The global econ­omy was ex­pected to grow 5.3 per cent next year af­ter shrink­ing 4 per cent this year, a touch higher than the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund’s pro­jec­tion of 5.2 per cent for next year.</p>
    <p>But nearly 80 per cent of economists, or 119 of 150, said a weaker global re­cov­ery than pre­vi­ously thought was the greater risk next year, rather than a vig­or­ous re­bound or a re­newed down­turn.</p>
    <p>For many ma­jor economies, it has been whiplash: plung­ing into the deep­est con­trac­tion on record, then grow­ing at the fastest pace ever, only to face trou­ble once again dur­ing the cur­rent quar­ter.</p>
    <p>“Un­for­tu­nately Q4 also comes with re­newed virus chal­lenges. Eco­nom­i­cally speak­ing, we might have to bridge an­other six months or more be­fore a vac­cine can of­fer sub­stan­tial re­lief and should weigh heav­ily on ac­tiv­ity in the near term,” said Mr Ste­fan Koop­man, se­nior mar­ket econ­o­mist at Rabobank.</p>
    <p>De­spite ex­pec­ta­tions for fur­ther mon­e­tary stim­u­lus in the euro zone and Bri­tain, and an­other round of United States fis­cal sup­port, the eco­nomic out­look was sub­dued in the lat­est polls, with the fresh rise in cases the big­gest risk to re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>For Ja­pan, economists said the gov­ern­ment needs to pledge a third stim­u­lus pack­age to shore up an econ­omy ham­mered by the pan­demic, while the Aus­tralian and Cana­dian economies were pre­dicted to grow at a much weaker pace than pre­vi­ously thought.</p>
    <p>China, the world’s sec­ond­largest econ­omy, was pro­jected to grow 8.4 per cent next year, in stark con­trast to much weaker re­cov­er­ies ev­ery­where else.</p>
    <p>But some economists out­side China ex­pected a much lower fig­ure and said that many fore­casts do not cap­ture the real ex­tent of the eco­nomic hit.</p>
    <p>TOUGH QUAR­TER AHEAD</p>
    <p>Eco­nom­i­cally speak­ing, we might have to bridge an­other six months or more be­fore a vac­cine can of­fer sub­stan­tial re­lief and should weigh heav­ily on ac­tiv­ity in the near term. ’’</p>
    <p>MR STE­FAN KOOP­MAN, se­nior mar­ket econ­o­mist at Rabobank, on the chal­lenges ahead.</p>
