    <p>One trick that great pow­ers com­pet­ing with other large op­po­nents can re­sort to is to peel off their ri­val’s key al­lies; the gam­bit tends to iso­late the com­peti­tor and of­fers a whole host of other strate­gic op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>That is what Dr Henry Kissinger did al­most pre­cisely half a cen­tury ago when he se­cretly trav­elled to Beijing at the start of a process which brought China and the United States to­gether at the ex­pense of the Soviet Union. It was an au­da­cious, his­toric gam­bit which turned China into an ad­di­tional Amer­i­can power lever, has­tened the demise of the Soviet Union and, ul­ti­mately, also changed the world.</p>
    <p>Are the Chi­nese play­ing the same game against the US by peel­ing off Amer­ica’s Euro­pean al­lies? That is clearly what Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping sought with the re­cent sign­ing of a sig­nif­i­cant in­vest­ment deal with the</p>
    <p>Euro­pean Union. Con­cluded in a hurry on the very last day of 2020, the agree­ment is os­ten­si­bly in­tended to smooth trade be­tween Beijing and Europe.</p>
    <p>But top Beijing of­fi­cials can­not even be both­ered to deny sug­ges­tions that their real ob­jec­tive was to pro­vide Europe with enough eco­nomic in­cen­tives not to make a joint cause with the US against China when Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den takes of­fice in Wash­ing­ton later this month.</p>
    <p>And the fact that the Euro­peans have agreed to the deal in full knowl­edge that this will an­noy Mr Bi­den’s team is a clear in­di­ca­tion of just how tricky the in­com­ing US ad­min­is­tra­tion may find its task of per­suad­ing its key al­lies to co­or­di­nate their poli­cies to­wards China.</p>
    <p>China will not ever suc­ceed in play­ing the “Europe card” against the US in the same way that the US played the “China card” against Rus­sia half a cen­tury ago. But Beijing does not need to re­peat Dr Kissinger’s his­toric feat; it merely needs to suf­fi­ciently di­vide Amer­ica’s al­lies to de­flect any ex­pected US pres­sure.</p>
    <p>PLUS POINTS FOR THE EU</p>
    <p>For decades, EU mem­ber states con­ducted their busi­ness re­la­tion­ship with China through a va­ri­ety of bi­lat­eral trade agree­ments. Not only did this lead to a patch­work of ar­range­ments with large dif­fer­ences be­tween them, but Beijing could also eas­ily pla­cate in­di­vid­ual EU govern­ments by of­fer­ing ben­e­fits for their spe­cific com­pa­nies while keep­ing po­ten­tially at­trac­tive sec­tors to other mem­ber states closed.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Com­mis­sion, the EU’s ex­ec­u­tive, is there­fore cor­rect in ar­gu­ing that its plan to re­place the 25 ex­ist­ing bi­lat­eral agree­ments with one Com­pre­hen­sive Agree­ment on In­vest­ment (or CAI as the deal is for­mally called) is an ex­pres­sion of Euro­pean strength, rather than weak­ness, as some of the agree­ment’s crit­ics have charged.</p>
    <p>Once the CAI comes into force, Beijing would lose some of its abil­ity to de­ploy di­vide-and-rule ne­go­ti­at­ing strate­gies in Europe. And the tini­est com­pany in the small­est mem­ber state will en­joy the same rights in China as the might­i­est con­glom­er­ate from, say, Ger­many. So, far from mak­ing sig­nif­i­cant con­ces­sions to China, the Chi­nese are the ones who con­ceded a great deal to Europe, ar­gues the Com­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>It is also true that EU mem­ber states gave the Com­mis­sion the man­date to ne­go­ti­ate a com­pre­hen­sive in­vest­ment agree­ment with China back in 2014, so it is a bit odd to ac­cuse the EU of rush­ing through a doc­u­ment which was years in the mak­ing.</p>
    <p>EU of­fi­cials con­sider the in­vest­ment agree­ment a rel­a­tively lim­ited ef­fort to ease com­mer­cial re­la­tions with China with­out sig­nif­i­cant geopo­lit­i­cal im­pli­ca­tions. The pact has strong sup­port among Euro­pean com­pa­nies in­vest­ing in China be­cause it would lift re­quire­ments which cur­rently force in­vestors to op­er­ate through joint ven­tures with Chi­nese part­ners and there­fore share sen­si­tive tech­nol­ogy. The agree­ment would also open the Chi­nese fi­nan­cial and health­care mar­kets to EU firms.</p>
    <p>And far from duck­ing sen­si­tive po­lit­i­cal is­sues, EU ne­go­tia­tors claim to have ex­tracted vi­tal po­lit­i­cal con­ces­sions from Beijing. The CAI text ref­er­ences the need to up­hold labour stan­dards, in­clud­ing the elim­i­na­tion of forced labour.</p>
    <p>Ac­cu­sa­tions that China may be us­ing peo­ple locked up in al­leged re-ed­u­ca­tion camps in Xin­jiang to man­u­fac­ture goods or may be de­ploy­ing its prison pop­u­la­tion as cheap labour were, there­fore, ad­dressed. “This agree­ment will up­hold our in­ter­ests and pro­motes our core val­ues. It pro­vides us with a lever to erad­i­cate forced labour,” said Dr Ur­sula von der Leyen, the Com­mis­sion’s pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>QUES­TION­ABLE PRO­VI­SIONS</p>
    <p>Sadly, this is only one side of the story.</p>
    <p>First, the agree­ment is nowhere near as com­pre­hen­sive as the EU ne­go­tia­tors bill it. The pur­pose of the CAI is lim­ited to for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment and con­tains no trade clauses.</p>
    <p>There are some new and in­ter­est­ing pro­vi­sions on sus­tain­abil­ity, en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion and cli­mate change. But it is a con­sid­er­able ex­ag­ger­a­tion to claim that the CAI pro­vides Euro­pean in­vestors with the so-called “level play­ing field” they crave.</p>
    <p>EU ne­go­tia­tors tout a Chi­nese com­mit­ment to elim­i­nate hid­den sub­si­dies as an out­stand­ing achieve­ment. But the only sub­si­dies cov­ered are those in the in­vest­ment sec­tor, rather than in man­u­fac­tur­ing. And it is in man­u­fac­tur­ing that most of the Euro­pean in­vest­ment takes place. It is also in man­u­fac­tur­ing that hid­den sub­si­dies are most chal­leng­ing to iden­tify.</p>
    <p>And, as Dr Sari Arho Havren, a Fin­nish ex­pert on trade with China, pointed out, what is one to make of the prom­ise in the in­vest­ment ac­cord that “China will en­sure that state-owned en­ter­prises ac­tive in the mar­ket take de­ci­sions solely based on com­mer­cial con­sid­er­a­tions” when one com­pares this pledge to state­ments by Pres­i­dent Xi who called on of­fi­cials to “strengthen and im­prove the Com­mu­nist Party’s lead­er­ship of state-owned en­ter­prises and the role it plays in these en­ter­prises, to make them the most re­li­able force of the party”?</p>
    <p>Has Mr Xi dropped this ob­jec­tive of mak­ing com­pa­nies obey party rather than mar­ket or­ders, or are the prom­ises made to the Euro­peans of lit­tle ef­fect?</p>
    <p>The same ap­plies to China’s com­mit­ment to the abo­li­tion of forced labour. Ever since China’s ac­ces­sion to the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion in 2001, Beijing has promised to “strive” to “im­ple­ment” such stan­dards. A sim­i­lar prom­ise fea­tures in the lat­est EU treaty, so what Beijing now prom­ises has been the Chi­nese pledge for decades.</p>
    <p>A fur­ther com­pli­cat­ing fac­tor is that China al­ready de­nies that it uses forced labour. If the Euro­peans be­lieved this de­nial, there would have been no need to in­sist on such pro­vi­sions. But if they do not ac­cept the Chi­nese dis­claimer, it is dif­fi­cult to see how China could per­suade the Euro­peans in the fu­ture that a prac­tice Beijing claims is not tak­ing place has now stopped.</p>
    <p>THE PO­LIT­I­CAL MES­SAGES</p>
    <p>But the big­gest prob­lem lies in the po­lit­i­cal mes­sages con­veyed by the con­clu­sion of this agree­ment.</p>
    <p>The ar­gu­ment that this is a deal ne­go­ti­ated since 2014 which just hap­pened to be con­cluded now is non­sense. For the re­al­ity is that right un­til Septem­ber last year, Beijing re­fused to budge in ne­go­ti­a­tions, and it did so im­me­di­ately only af­ter Mr Bi­den won the US elec­tion. The ob­jec­tive was clear enough: to en­sure that the Euro­peans are of­fered some­thing to avoid them join­ing the Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>What is sig­nif­i­cant, too, is that the EU’s re­sponse is more than just a re­ac­tion to its in­creas­ingly fraught re­la­tion­ship with the out­go­ing Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, which has shown no in­ter­est in talk­ing to the Euro­peans about global trade, and of­ten cas­ti­gated Europe in the same breath as China.</p>
    <p>The EU went much fur­ther, by snub­bing the in­com­ing US ad­min­is­tra­tion be­fore it has even taken of­fice.</p>
    <p>Mr Jake Sul­li­van, the Pres­i­dent-elect’s na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser, gen­tly tried to de­liver a clear mes­sage to Europe: “The Bi­den-Har­ris ad­min­is­tra­tion would wel­come early con­sul­ta­tions with our Euro­pean part­ners on our com­mon con­cerns about China’s eco­nomic prac­tices,” he tweeted be­fore the deal was con­cluded.</p>
    <p>Some Euro­peans ea­gerly ac­cepted the ap­peal to wait. “We need more con­sul­ta­tions and trans­parency bring­ing our transat­lantic al­lies on board,” Pol­ish For­eign Min­is­ter Zbig­niew</p>
    <p>Rau said. “A good, bal­anced deal is bet­ter than a pre­ma­ture one,” he added.</p>
    <p>And Mr Franck Ri­ester, a French trade min­is­ter, claimed his coun­try would not sign an agree­ment un­less China ad­dresses forced labour is­sues more specif­i­cally. By Christ­mas, Chi­nese For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi was scram­bling to sal­vage the deal, and even Pres­i­dent Xi got on the phone to Euro­pean lead­ers.</p>
    <p>Yet, with lit­er­ally hours to spare to the end of the year, the deal was con­cluded. The of­fi­cial ex­pla­na­tion is that, by then, all EU mem­ber states dropped their ob­jec­tions. The real rea­son is that Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel was de­ter­mined to con­clude mat­ters, and no coun­try dared stand in her way.</p>
    <p>The episode is a use­ful re­minder that al­though the Ger­mans al­ways like to claim that all their na­tional in­ter­ests are Euro­pean in­ter­ests, Ber­lin will not hes­i­tate to put its in­ter­ests first should the oc­ca­sion call for it. That is what it has done with a gas pipe­line which runs from Rus­sia to Ger­many and which is op­posed by many EU states, and that is what it has now done with China.</p>
    <p>The po­lit­i­cal op­tics at the “vir­tual” sum­mit, dur­ing which the deal was cer­e­mo­ni­ally agreed with Pres­i­dent Xi, also sent an­other clear sig­nal – Dr Merkel was present, as Ger­many held the ro­tat­ing pres­i­dency of the EU, and also French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron, who had no rea­son to be there, apart from the fact that Dr Merkel needed him to back the project – that in the 27-mem­ber group­ing of Euro­pean na­tions, the Franco-Ger­man tan­dem calls the shots.</p>
    <p>MERKEL’S CAL­CU­LA­TIONS</p>
    <p>It is usu­ally ar­gued that the</p>
    <p>Ger­man Chan­cel­lor is de­ter­mined to keep good re­la­tions with China be­cause her coun­try’s big­gest com­pa­nies are too de­pen­dent on Chi­nese con­sumers for Ber­lin to risk alien­at­ing Beijing. This is un­doubt­edly an im­por­tant con­sid­er­a­tion, es­pe­cially for Ger­many’s car and chem­i­cal man­u­fac­tur­ers.</p>
    <p>But it is not the only con­sid­er­a­tion. Dr Merkel, who is likely to re­tire in the sec­ond half of this year af­ter al­most 16 years in power, ap­proaches China with a deep sense of fore­bod­ing about Ger­many’s prospects. In re­marks two years ago at the Munich Se­cu­rity Con­fer­ence – an an­nual get-to­gether of world lead­ers – she de­scribed Ger­many’s prospects as “poor”, pri­mar­ily be­cause it is in a con­ti­nent chal­lenged by tech­no­log­i­cal change and squeezed from all sides.</p>
    <p>Elab­o­rat­ing on that in an­other con­fer­ence, she noted that “if you look at what we Euro­peans have on our doorstep, it looks quite chal­leng­ing... We have Rus­sia and right af­ter that, China. China and Rus­sia are mov­ing closer”.</p>
    <p>Dr Merkel does not re­gard US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump as an aber­ra­tion but as part of an Amer­i­can iso­la­tion­ist trend. As seen from her of­fice, in­com­ing pres­i­dent Bi­den will be more po­lite and co­op­er­a­tive, yet ul­ti­mately will not be will­ing or even ca­pa­ble of ad­dress­ing Europe’s weak­nesses.</p>
    <p>For Dr Merkel, China is, there­fore, a lever and a po­ten­tial force mul­ti­plier. And as she sees it, Europe’s pol­icy must be to keep it­self dis­tant from a po­ten­tial US-China show­down and, per­haps, even act as the pen­du­lum be­tween the two.</p>
    <p>None of this pre­vents the US from co­op­er­at­ing with the Euro­peans. Ever the ac­com­plished diplo­mat, Mr Sul­li­van has in­di­cated that there are plenty of ar­eas in which Europe and the US can and will co­op­er­ate.</p>
    <p>And the in­vest­ment agree­ment may yet be re­jected when it comes to rat­i­fi­ca­tion be­fore the Euro­pean Par­lia­ment shortly.</p>
    <p>But there is no ques­tion that the episode is an early warn­ing for the in­com­ing US ad­min­is­tra­tion that forg­ing a co­op­er­a­tive re­la­tion­ship with Europe over ap­proaches to China will be far from easy.</p>
