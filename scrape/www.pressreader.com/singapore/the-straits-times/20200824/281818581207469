    <p>NEW DELHI • One of In­dia’s most prom­i­nent lawyers faces a dead­line to­day to apol­o­gise to the Supreme Court or risk go­ing to jail, in a case test­ing the ju­di­ciary’s open­ness to crit­i­cism and spark­ing a de­bate on free­dom of speech in the world’s largest democ­racy.</p>
    <p>Prashant Bhushan, 63, was found guilty of crim­i­nal con­tempt for at­tempt­ing “to scan­dalise the en­tire in­sti­tu­tion” with Twit­ter posts de­pict­ing the Chief Jus­tice on a mo­tor­cy­cle while the court’s work was cur­tailed due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, and crit­i­cis­ing pre­vi­ous top judges.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, In­dia’s top court or­dered Bhushan, who has cham­pi­oned pub­lic in­ter­est lit­i­ga­tion, to is­sue an “un­con­di­tional apol­ogy” by to­day.</p>
    <p>He faces up to six months in jail or a fine of 2,000 ru­pees (S$36.60), or both.</p>
    <p>“Any apol­ogy would be in­sin­cere,” Bhushan told Reuters, de­clin­ing to com­ment fur­ther as the mat­ter is be­fore the court.</p>
    <p>He told the court in a state­ment last Thurs­day that he would “cheer­fully sub­mit to any penalty” over the two June tweets, which he said “rep­re­sented my bona fide be­liefs, the ex­pres­sion of which must be per­mis­si­ble in any democ­racy”.</p>
    <p>If Bhushan apol­o­gises, the court has said it would hold a hear­ing to­mor­row. It was not clear when or how the court would re­spond if he does not apol­o­gise.</p>
    <p>Re­gard­less of the out­come, Bhushan’s case is putting the Supreme Court – one of In­dia’s most re­spected in­sti­tu­tions – on trial, test­ing how much judges may be openly crit­i­cised in a so­ci­ety known for free­wheel­ing de­bate.</p>
    <p>Some lawyers and me­dia ed­i­to­ri­als sup­port Bhushan, say­ing the court is be­ing too harsh, ar­gu­ing that his tweets amounted to legally pro­tected crit­i­cism. “A Bar si­lenced un­der the threat of con­tempt will un­der­mine the in­de­pen­dence and, ul­ti­mately, the strength of the court,” more than 2,400 In­dian lawyers wrote in an on­line pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers crit­i­cised Bhushan, who has 1.7 mil­lion Twit­ter fol­low­ers.</p>
    <p>The Supreme Court, in its 108-page or­der in Bhushan’s case, noted it is “re­quired to be mag­nan­i­mous” to crit­i­cism – though it said “such mag­na­nim­ity can­not be stretched”.</p>
    <p>In his first tweet, Bhushan posted a vi­ral photo of Chief Jus­tice S.A. Bobde astride a Har­ley-David­son.</p>
    <p>He wrote that Chief Jus­tice Bobde was sit­ting on a five mil­lion ru­pee mo­tor­cy­cle with­out a mask or a hel­met when ci­ti­zens were be­ing de­nied jus­tice as the court was in lock­down.</p>
    <p>The Supreme Court ruled the tweet was “patently false” and had the “ten­dency to shake the con­fi­dence of the pub­lic”, as the court was hear­ing mat­ters, even dur­ing the coro­n­avirus shut­down.</p>
    <p>In the other tweet, Bhushan wrote that when his­to­ri­ans look at how democ­racy has been de­stroyed in In­dia in the past six years, they will mark the role of the court and the past four top jus­tices.</p>
    <p>That tweet “has the ef­fect of desta­bil­is­ing the very foun­da­tion of this im­por­tant pil­lar of the In­dian democ­racy” and “di­rectly af­fronts the majesty of law”, the court said.</p>
    <p>Both of Bhushan’s tweets have been sus­pended by Twit­ter.</p>
