    <p>As Washington har­dens on China, with pun­dits say­ing the United States is push­ing for regime change, will its tough stance re­sult in China’s ca­pit­u­la­tion and change, or even its col­lapse? Not so fast, says global af­fairs cor­re­spon­dent Ben­jamin Kang Lim (be­low).</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the Cold War in the 1950s, then United States Sec­re­tary of State Frank Fos­ter Dulles coined the phrase “peace­ful evo­lu­tion” which, de­spite its pa­cific-sound­ing words, is an at­tempt to in­fil­trate and sub­vert a coun­try via non-mil­i­tary means. This was Washington’s ploy to spread West­ern po­lit­i­cal ideas and life­styles to nudge com­mu­nist dic­ta­tor­ships into evolv­ing into democ­ra­cies.</p>
    <p>Staunchly anti-com­mu­nist, Mr Dulles re­fused to shake the hand of then Chi­nese Premier Zhou Enlai at the 1954 Geneva Con­fer­ence on In­dochina.</p>
    <p>Decades of US-China ties that fol­lowed ran the gamut from such at­tempts to change China, to en­gage­ment, to con­tain­ment. But in re­cent months, the pen­du­lum ap­pears to be swing­ing back to a more ro­bust con­cept of “peace­ful evo­lu­tion” that in­cludes push­ing for change – ex­cept that this time, the Chi­nese are ac­tively re­sist­ing, and it is an open ques­tion whether such at­tempts to in­flu­ence China do­mes­ti­cally will see it democra­tise, or harden po­lit­i­cally.</p>
    <p>FROM COLD WAR TO EN­GAGE­MENT</p>
    <p>First, a brief his­tory of ties.</p>
    <p>The Cold War be­tween Bei­jing and Washington ended with US Pres­i­dent Richard Nixon’s his­toric visit to China in 1972. He shook the hand of Mr Zhou upon ar­rival, a ges­ture de­scribed by the China Busi­ness Re­view mag­a­zine as “the hand­shake that changed the world”.</p>
    <p>The phrase “peace­ful evo­lu­tion” all but dis­ap­peared from the State Depart­ment and White House’s lex­i­con as Mr Nixon wooed Amer­ica’s sec­ondary en­emy China to team up against its pri­mary en­emy then, the now-de­funct Soviet Union.</p>
    <p>Washington switched diplo­matic recog­ni­tion from Taipei to Bei­jing in 1979, open­ing the door to trade, in­vest­ment, tourism, stu­dent and cul­tural ex­changes, arms sales and even in­tel­li­gence shar­ing. For about a decade, China was the dar­ling of the US, but their diplo­matic hon­ey­moon ended when Chi­nese troops crushed the Tianan­men pro-democ­racy protests in 1989.</p>
    <p>Through­out this pe­riod, China re­ceived US over­tures with cau­tion.</p>
    <p>China’s lead­ers never let down their guard against “spir­i­tual pol­lu­tion” and “bour­geois lib­er­al­i­sa­tion” – com­mu­nist jar­gon for “peace­ful evo­lu­tion” which China’s pol­i­cy­mak­ers are con­vinced is the the­o­ret­i­cal foun­da­tion of Amer­ica’s China pol­icy. This wari­ness was preva­lent even be­fore the dis­in­te­gra­tion of the Soviet Union and the col­lapse of com­mu­nism in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s – two events the Chi­nese would have said vin­di­cated their sus­pi­cion of the US “peace­ful evo­lu­tion” doc­trine.</p>
    <p>With peace­ful evo­lu­tion creep­ing in, China’s Bam­boo Cur­tain came down. Still nom­i­nally com­mu­nist, the world’s most pop­u­lous na­tion flirted with cap­i­tal­ism, trans­form­ing it­self from an eco­nomic back­wa­ter into an ex­port pow­er­house.</p>
    <p>To China’s hawks, the at­trac­tion and in­va­sion of Amer­i­can cul­ture were fa­tal to do­mes­tic cul­ture – or­di­nary Chi­nese traded their Mao suits for busi­ness suits, shirts and jeans, and de­voured McDon­ald’s ham­burg­ers and Ken­tucky Fried Chicken, Coke, Hol­ly­wood movies and mu­sic.</p>
    <p>But to the dis­may of the US, peace­ful evo­lu­tion has not spilled over into the po­lit­i­cal sphere and the coro­n­avirus epi­demic did not turn out to be China’s Ch­er­nobyl mo­ment.</p>
    <p>By the 1990s, China had emerged to be­come the world’s fac­tory. It dis­placed Ja­pan as the world’s sec­ond-big­gest econ­omy at the end of 2010 – a feat that could not have hap­pened with­out Washington giv­ing its bless­ings for Bei­jing to join the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion in 2001.</p>
    <p>PE­RIOD OF CON­TAIN­MENT</p>
    <p>China helped bail the US out of the 2007-2008 fi­nan­cial cri­sis, but the US was alarmed by China’s grow­ing diplo­matic and do­mes­tic as­sertive­ness, and sought to con­tain it. Thus be­gan an era of un­easy ties.</p>
    <p>Af­ter as­sum­ing of­fice in 2009, US Pres­i­dent Barack Obama in­tro­duced his “Pivot to Asia” for­eign pol­icy and Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship trade al­liance – which for Bei­jing were syn­ony­mous with peace­ful evo­lu­tion and seen as</p>
    <p>“hos­tile... part of a broader ef­fort to en­cir­cle China”, US Army Cap­tain John Ford, who stud­ied at Pek­ing Uni­ver­sity, wrote in The Diplo­mat in 2017.</p>
    <p>Last year, when vi­o­lent protests broke out for months in Hong Kong, a former Bri­tish colony that re­turned to Chi­nese rule in 1997, Bei­jing was con­vinced that what it deemed ri­ots were or­ches­trated and sup­ported by Amer­ica, as part of the lat­ter’s over­ar­ch­ing goal to desta­bilise China by first push­ing for democ­racy in the city and then, even­tu­ally, across the whole of China.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong protests were branded a colour revo­lu­tion – an up­date of the 1950s-era “peace­ful evo­lu­tion” con­cept and one that refers to the protests and labour strikes that brought down cor­rupt and au­thor­i­tar­ian gov­ern­ments in some coun­tries in Cen­tral Asia and the Mid­dle East in the 2000s.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials and diplo­mats de­nied peace­ful evo­lu­tion, con­tain­ment and colour revo­lu­tion were ever US govern­ment poli­cies, but Bei­jing is un­con­vinced.</p>
    <p>PUSH­ING FOR CHANGE</p>
    <p>Plau­si­ble de­ni­a­bil­ity ended on July 23 when US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo de­clared that the era of “blind en­gage­ment” with China was over, ac­cus­ing Bei­jing of steal­ing tech­nol­ogy and in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty and of hu­man rights abuses.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the Richard Nixon Pres­i­den­tial Li­brary, Mr Pom­peo called on like-minded democ­ra­cies to form an al­liance and for the Chi­nese peo­ple to press the</p>
    <p>Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party (CCP) to change, call­ing it the “mis­sion of our time”.</p>
    <p>“If the free world doesn’t change, com­mu­nist China will surely change us,” Mr Pom­peo said, putting an end to the am­bi­gu­ity of Amer­ica’s China pol­icy and making it an ex­plicit goal of the US to change China. He stopped short of call­ing for regime change but, for the Chi­nese lead­er­ship, the mes­sage could not be more per­spic­u­ous.</p>
    <p>“He wants to pre­sent him­self as the John Fos­ter Dulles of the 21st cen­tury, launch­ing a new cru­sade against China in a glob­alised world,” Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Hua Chun­y­ing tweeted. “What he is do­ing is as fu­tile as an ant try­ing to shake a tree.”</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo’s state­ment comes at a time when cur­rent Sino-US re­la­tions have plunged to a nadir over a host of dis­putes since last year – a trade, tech and me­dia war, Hong Kong, Xin­jiang, Tai­wan, Ti­bet and the dis­puted South China Sea.</p>
    <p>This is ex­ac­er­bated by the Covid-19 pan­demic which US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has re­peat­edly la­belled the “China virus”.</p>
    <p>As Mr Trump seeks re-elec­tion in Novem­ber, Washington has sought to di­vert at­ten­tion away from its own bungling of the pan­demic – US in­fec­tions have topped 5.56 mil­lion and deaths have ex­ceeded 173,600 – and dou­bled down on Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>It re­cently barred one of the CCP’s 25 most pow­er­ful peo­ple from en­ter­ing the US for al­leged hu­man rights abuses in Xin­jiang, and has height­ened feel­ings by call­ing Bei­jing’s claims in the South China Sea “com­pletely un­law­ful”. The US also or­dered the clo­sure of the Chi­nese con­sulate in Hous­ton amid ac­cu­sa­tions of spy­ing. In a tit-for-tat move, China shut the US con­sulate in the south-west­ern city of Chengdu. Pres­i­dent Trump also ended pref­er­en­tial trade treat­ment for Hong Kong last month af­ter China’s Par­lia­ment pushed through a con­tro­ver­sial na­tional se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>Such ac­tions and the war of words – with both sides ac­cus­ing each other of be­hav­ing like Josef Stalin, or re­sort­ing to Nazi</p>
    <p>Ger­many ex­trem­ism – have con­vinced Bei­jing that Washington wants to pur­sue regime change in China now.</p>
    <p>“Deep­en­ing en­mity could am­plify Bei­jing’s as­sess­ment that Washington may pur­sue the over­throw of the CCP as an end goal,” Mr John Cul­ver, a re­tired Cen­tral In­tel­li­gence Agency an­a­lyst of East Asian af­fairs, wrote in The In­ter­preter.</p>
    <p>Mr Cul­ver’s as­sess­ment is spot on.</p>
    <p>Many in China, in­clud­ing or­di­nary Chi­nese, think that an in­creas­ingly des­per­ate Washington is us­ing the pre­text of pro­mot­ing democ­racy to de­monise and dis­credit Bei­jing, so as to cause the CCP to lose sup­port, cre­ate po­lit­i­cal chaos and po­ten­tially cause China to im­plode in­ter­nally.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo and the US ad­min­is­tra­tion’s co­terie of Chi­nese-speak­ing ad­vis­ers may think they un­der­stand China, but they are get­ting the wrong end of the stick. Mr Pom­peo’s call on the Chi­nese to rise up against the CCP is wish­ful think­ing and likely to fall on deaf ears.</p>
    <p>The lives of or­di­nary Chi­nese have dra­mat­i­cally im­proved in the past four decades. Har­vard Uni­ver­sity’s Ash Cen­tre con­ducted eight sur­veys from 2003 to 2016, interviewi­ng about 32,000 re­spon­dents. In 2016, the last year the sur­vey was con­ducted, 95.5 per cent of re­spon­dents were ei­ther “rel­a­tively sat­is­fied” or “highly sat­is­fied” with the cen­tral govern­ment, the Har­vard Gazette re­ported on July 9. But re­spon­dents held con­sid­er­ably less favourable views to­wards lo­cal gov­ern­ments.</p>
    <p>Over­whelm­ing sat­is­fac­tion is also due in part to pro­pa­ganda and me­dia cen­sor­ship, mean­ing the peo­ple hear only what the party wants them to hear. The party can but does not need to fan the flames of na­tion­al­ism.</p>
    <p>Many lo­cal Chi­nese al­ready see Washington as a bully. “The bul­ly­ing and de­mon­i­sa­tion will only back­fire,” a party source told The Straits Times, re­quest­ing anonymity.</p>
    <p>“It will only co­a­lesce the Chi­nese lead­er­ship and or­di­nary peo­ple,” the source said, adding that the hos­til­ity would strengthen the hand of Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping in­ter­nally. “We will never fire the first shot, but we are not afraid of fight­ing.”</p>
    <p>US-CHINA TIES AF­TER NOVEM­BER</p>
    <p>Will the US pol­icy as ar­tic­u­lated by Mr Pom­peo – to push for change in China – be sus­tained? A lot hinges on the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in Novem­ber. Pres­i­dent Trump is un­pre­dictable and could change his mind, de­fy­ing his hawk­ish ad­vis­ers.</p>
    <p>If pre­sump­tive Demo­cratic nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den wins, he will not be able to reverse Amer­ica’s China pol­icy overnight. Bei­jing can only hope for the best and brace it­self for the worst.</p>
    <p>Mr Dulles sought to con­tain com­mu­nism and re­fused to shake Premier Zhou’s hand, but he was a wor­thy op­po­nent – nei­ther facile nor ir­ra­tional. He was not a dem­a­gogue diplo­mat who “poured dirty wa­ter” to de­monise China and its lead­ers.</p>
    <p>If US hawks are won­der­ing why China has not ac­qui­esced, and why hun­dreds of mil­lions of Chi­nese remain im­per­vi­ous to their call for dis­sent against the CCP, they should take note of what Mao Ze­dong once said: “Wher­ever there is op­pres­sion, there is re­sis­tance.”</p>
