    <p>SYD­NEY • Aus­tralia’s na­tional car­rier, Qan­tas, has been run­ning pas­sen­ger flights for 98 years, yet its fastest-sell­ing flight turned out to be a jour­ney that goes nowhere.</p>
    <p>The air­line, which has been heav­ily hit by the Covid-19 pan­demic, will con­duct a seven-hour scenic voy­age next Satur­day that will take off from Syd­ney, fly over sights such as the Great Bar­rier Reef and Uluru, and then re­turn to Syd­ney.</p>
    <p>The 134 tick­ets aboard the B787 Dream­liner cost A$787 to A$3,787 (S$770 to S$3,700). The flight sold out in just 10 min­utes, mak­ing it “prob­a­bly the fastest-sell­ing flight in Qan­tas his­tory”, ac­cord­ing to an air­line spokesman.</p>
    <p>But the so-called Great South­ern Land flight has caused a back­lash over con­cerns that it will un­nec­es­sar­ily emit car­bon pol­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>The group Flight Free Aus­tralia, which cam­paigns for non-pol­lut­ing trans­port op­tions, has called for a ban on such “nowhere” flights.</p>
    <p>“Qan­tas’ ‘flights to nowhere’ should be re­named ‘flights to a hot­ter planet’,” a spokesman, Mr Mark Carter, told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>“The pas­sen­gers on Qan­tas’ ini­tial flight to nowhere will in­crease their emis­sions for a whole year by 10 per cent in just 7 hours – help­ing kill the Great Bar­rier Reef they view from their win­dows.”</p>
    <p>An on­line pe­ti­tion has been launched to urge Qan­tas and Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son to pre­vent fu­ture “point­less and pol­lut­ing nowhere flights”. As of yes­ter­day, the pe­ti­tion had about 800 sig­na­tures.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers, how­ever, have sug­gested the flight, which will be car­bon-neu­tral through sup­port for emis­sion off­sets, could help to spur tourism and boost the strug­gling air­line sec­tor. Qan­tas has al­ready cut 6,000 jobs and is ex­pected to fur­ther lay off about 2,500 staff as it strug­gles to deal with the im­pact of curbs on for­eign and in­ter­state travel.</p>
    <p>A travel writer, Mr Ben Ground­wa­ter, said he be­lieved such scenic flights have “plenty of pos­i­tive ef­fects” that may out­weigh the neg­a­tives. He pointed to the need to save jobs at Qan­tas and sug­gested that flights over threat­ened re­gions such as the Great Bar­rier Reef might en­cour­age peo­ple to care more about pro­tect­ing them.</p>
    <p>“The op­por­tu­nity to see these won­ders from the air is a unique one, and the per­fect way to show­case their beauty and their fragility,” he wrote on Aus­tralia’s Trav­eller web­site.</p>
    <p>“A car­bon-neu­tral flight over a nat­u­ral won­der of the world – a flight, it should be said, full of peo­ple who won’t tram­ple on the earth, won’t leave foot­prints, won’t bother the wildlife or des­e­crate sa­cred land – is not the worst idea any­one ever had.”</p>
    <p>Qan­tas had ini­tially in­di­cated it might con­sider fur­ther scenic flights. But a spokesman told ST that there are no fur­ther planned scenic flights.</p>
    <p>While air­lines must face the grim re­al­ity that air travel may not re­turn to pre-pan­demic lev­els for years, Aus­tralia’s travel sec­tor is slowly start­ing to re­sume oper­a­tions as Covid-19 num­bers re­cede.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the coun­try recorded 10 new cases of Covid-19, eight of which in­volved com­mu­nity trans­mis­sions, all of them in Vic­to­ria, where case num­bers have plunged. In to­tal, Aus­tralia has recorded 27,121 Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Sin­ga­pore an­nounced this past week that it will al­low en­try to trav­ellers from Aus­tralia, ex­cept the state of Vic­to­ria, from Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s fed­eral gov­ern­ment also an­nounced yes­ter­day that the state of New South Wales and the North­ern Ter­ri­tory will al­low New Zealan­ders to visit with­out need­ing to quar­an­tine from Oct 16.</p>
    <p>How­ever, New Zealand will con­tinue to bar trav­ellers from Aus­tralia and will re­quire re­turnees to quar­an­tine. But there are hopes the New Zealand gov­ern­ment may con­sider lift­ing these re­stric­tions after the coun­try’s elec­tion on Oct 17.</p>
    <p>In other hope­ful signs, Can­berra is also in dis­cus­sion with Pa­cific coun­tries about set­ting up travel bub­bles that would al­low trav­ellers be­tween the des­ti­na­tions to avoid quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralians have been find­ing other ways to sat­isfy their yearn­ing to ex­pe­ri­ence air­line travel again. For those who miss air­line meals, an in­flight caterer, Gate Gourmet, has been sell­ing sets of frozen meal packs, which can be col­lected from air­ports in Bris­bane and Syd­ney.</p>
