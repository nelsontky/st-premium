Keep on moving even if you feel lazy. You should be able to find a spark within yourself that keeps you on track and energised. Taurus (April 20 - May 20)
Great personal energy comes your way and brings you closer to nature even if you are a hardcore tech-lover. Gemini (May 21 - June 20)
Things do not look good right now – but that just means you either need to try harder or come back in a few days. Cancer (June 21 - July 22)
This is not a big social day. If you must drag yourself out and about, try to just smile and let others take the lead. Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)
You feel slightly larger than life – but watch out. People are on the lookout for signs of ego and will turn against you if you let them. Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)
You are feeling a bit more critical than usual – but your energy is good for nitpicking. Redirect it in a positive direction. Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)
You are thinking about your past and may not feel all that great about it. That is okay as most of us have things we would rather not dwell on. Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)
The day is all about willpower and who wants to win. You may find that you need to push someone out of the way. Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21) You have your own way of saying and doing things and you need to make sure you are doing what comes naturally. Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)
It is a good time for you to move on autopilot – any plans you have are sure to work out just fine. Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18) You feel somewhat restricted – so see if you can just embrace that and keep your activities low-key. C: Children; CA: Current Affairs;
