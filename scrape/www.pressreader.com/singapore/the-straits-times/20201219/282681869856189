    <p>A new ap­peals di­vi­sion be­ing formed in the High Court, to han­dle some of the grow­ing num­ber of ap­peals mak­ing their way to the apex court, will start hear­ing cases from Jan 2.</p>
    <p>The new Ap­pel­late Di­vi­sion, which will hear civil ap­peals, is one of two divi­sions that will come un­der the High Court fol­low­ing a re­struc­tur­ing aimed at im­prov­ing the ef­fi­ciency of the courts.</p>
    <p>The other di­vi­sion is the Gen­eral Di­vi­sion, which will con­tinue to per­form the High Court’s cur­rent func­tions.</p>
    <p>With this change, High Court cases heard by the Gen­eral Di­vi­sion could go to the Ap­pel­late Di­vi­sion on ap­peal, a de­par­ture from the cur­rent ar­range­ment that sees all ap­peals against High Court de­ci­sions go­ing to the apex Court of Ap­peal.</p>
    <p>The High Court and the Court of Ap­peal make up the Supreme Court, which an­nounced de­tails of the changes in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It said High Court Judges Belinda Ang, Woo Bih Li and Quentin Loh will be ap­pointed Judges of the Ap­pel­late Di­vi­sion, with their terms start­ing from Jan 2. Jus­tice Ang will be pres­i­dent of the di­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>The struc­tural re­forms were given the nod in Par­lia­ment in Novem­ber last year, with amend­ments made to the Con­sti­tu­tion of the Repub­lic of Sin­ga­pore Act, the Supreme Court of Ju­di­ca­ture Act and the Judges’ Re­mu­ner­a­tion Act.</p>
    <p>The Supreme Court said the Court of Ap­peal will con­tinue to hear all crim­i­nal ap­peals, and pre­scribed cat­e­gories of civil ap­peals.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude ap­peals from con­sti­tu­tional law, ad­min­is­tra­tive law and con­tempt of court cases, as well as those in­volv­ing the Par­lia­men­tary Elec­tions Act and the Pres­i­den­tial Elec­tions Act.</p>
    <p>Civil ap­peals not in the pre­scribed list will be heard by the new Ap­pel­late Di­vi­sion, which will typ­i­cally sit in a panel of three judges.</p>
    <p>De­spite the pre­scribed cat­e­gories, the Court of Ap­peal will have the power to trans­fer civil cases be­tween it­self and the Ap­pel­late Di­vi­sion in ac­cor­dance with pro­vi­sions un­der the law.</p>
    <p>The Court of Ap­peal may also grant leave for ap­peal against the de­ci­sions of the Ap­pel­late Di­vi­sion, when the ap­peal raises a point of law of pub­lic im­por­tance.</p>
    <p>The new Ap­pel­late Di­vi­sion al­lows the Supreme Court to “bet­ter de­ploy ju­di­cial re­sources and man­age the ap­peals caseload... while con­tin­u­ing to main­tain high stan­dards of ac­cess to jus­tice and qual­ity of jus­tice”, the court said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Gen­eral Di­vi­sion, which in­cludes the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Com­mer­cial Court and the</p>
    <p>MORE COM­PLEX CASES</p>
    <p>In the past five years, the num­ber of cases re­ceived by the Court of Ap­peal has in­creased sig­nif­i­cantly – by more than 50 per cent, with cases get­ting more com­plex by virtue of the world we live in to­day.</p>
    <p>Fam­ily Di­vi­sion of the High Court, will have all the ju­ris­dic­tion and pow­ers of the ex­ist­ing High Court.</p>
    <p>This means it will hear the cases that now go to the High Court, in­clud­ing the ap­peals that em­anate from lower court cases.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Law Ed­win Tong, who tabled the amend­ments in Par­lia­ment, said in a Face­book post yes­ter­day: “In the past five years, the num­ber of cases re­ceived by the Court of Ap­peal has in­creased sig­nif­i­cantly – by more than 50 per cent, with cases get­ting more com­plex by virtue of the world we live in to­day.”</p>
    <p>He added: “To en­able the Courts to bet­ter man­age the ap­peals caseload and main­tain its high stan­dards of ac­cess to jus­tice and qual­ity of jus­tice, the new Ap­pel­late Di­vi­sion will have its own judges, who will hear cer­tain civil ap­peals that are cur­rently heard by the Court of Ap­peal.”</p>
