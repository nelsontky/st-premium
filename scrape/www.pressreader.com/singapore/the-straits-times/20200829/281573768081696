    <p>The United States has a choke­hold on China when it comes to the semi­con­duc­tor in­dus­try, as China lacks the tech­ni­cal ca­pac­ity to make chips so­phis­ti­cated enough to power the next gen­er­a­tion of ma­chines, says Bi­la­hari Kausikan (be­low).</p>
    <p>Asia has re­mained with­out ma­jor mil­i­tary con­fronta­tions for more than four decades, since the end of the Viet­nam War in 1975. The con­ti­nent with the most num­ber of ter­ri­to­rial dis­putes can­not, how­ever, take peace and sta­bil­ity for granted. The South China Sea, one of the most mil­i­tarised stretches of wa­ters any­where on the planet, has wit­nessed in­creas­ingly tense en­coun­ters be­tween the world’s two most pow­er­ful na­tions. This week, China fired four medium-range bal­lis­tic mis­siles dur­ing its on­go­ing mil­i­tary ex­er­cises around the dis­puted Para­cel Is­lands. The Pen­tagon said the move cast doubts over Bei­jing’s 2002 com­mit­ment to avoid provoca­tive ac­tiv­i­ties in the dis­puted seas. China raised ob­jec­tions to the en­try of an Amer­i­can re­con­nais­sance plane into a des­ig­nated no-fly zone and to a free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion op­er­a­tion by a guided mis­sile de­stroyer. Both na­tions have called their re­spec­tive con­duct per­mis­si­ble within in­ter­na­tional rules.</p>
    <p>Sino-Amer­i­can in­ter­ests have di­verged over the last decade as the US con­cluded that China had evolved into its strong­est com­peti­tor and would not lib­er­alise its po­lit­i­cal sys­tem as Washington had hoped. With its US$13 tril­lion (S$17.7 tril­lion) econ­omy, com­pris­ing strong man­u­fac­tur­ing, trade and tech­nol­ogy sec­tors, China has de­clared that it would take cen­tre stage in the global arena. As ad­ver­sar­ial el­e­ments come to dom­i­nate their re­la­tion­ship, the forecast for the re­gion looks choppy.</p>
    <p>Last month, the US called China’s claims across most of the South China Sea il­le­gal and dropped its neu­tral stance in re­gional ter­ri­to­rial dis­putes. This week, it black­listed two dozen Chi­nese com­pa­nies in­volved in the mil­i­tari­sa­tion of dis­puted reefs and shoals – the first such sanc­tions against Bei­jing over the dis­puted seas. China, mean­while, uni­lat­er­ally an­nounced in April the es­tab­lish­ment of two new ad­min­is­tra­tive struc­tures in dis­puted ar­eas of the South China Sea. It also re­leased names for some 80 ge­o­graph­i­cal fea­tures in the area, reach­ing into its favoured method of pur­su­ing claims in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>The geopo­lit­i­cal ten­sions are un­likely to dis­solve soon. Th­ese re­volve around high-stakes ques­tions of na­tional sovereignt­y. Con­tain­ing hos­til­i­ties and man­ag­ing the dif­fer­ences through ad­her­ence to in­ter­na­tional law re­mains the only way for­ward. But the ra­tio­nale for economic co­op­er­a­tion be­tween the US and China re­mains alive, if only be­cause the logic for it is so clear. It is this path that prom­ises break­throughs. With a new US pres­i­den­tial term be­gin­ning next year and two im­por­tant events in China’s po­lit­i­cal cal­en­dar to fol­low, there is an op­por­tu­nity to be seized. The 100th an­niver­sary of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party in 2021 and the 20th party congress in 2022 will be oc­ca­sions for di­rec­tion set­ting. Re­la­tions can be re­paired should Washington and Bei­jing not as­sume the worst of each other.</p>
