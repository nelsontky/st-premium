    <p>• Ar­me­nia and Azer­bai­jan, two for­mer Soviet re­publics in the Cau­ca­sus, are locked in a decades-long ter­ri­to­rial dis­pute. Here are the key is­sues sur­round­ing their con­flict:</p>
    <p>NAGORNO-KARABAKH</p>
    <p>At the heart of the stand-off be­tween Yerevan and Baku is the con­tested Nagorno-Karabakh re­gion.</p>
    <p>The Soviet au­thor­i­ties merged the pre­dom­i­nantly eth­nic Ar­me­nian ter­ri­tory with Azer­bai­jan in 1921. Af­ter the 1991 col­lapse of the Soviet Union, Ar­me­nian sep­a­ratists seized it in a move sup­ported by Yerevan.</p>
    <p>An en­su­ing war left 30,000 peo­ple dead and forced hun­dreds of thou­sands from their homes. De­spite a cease­fire me­di­ated in 1994 by Rus­sia, the United States and France, peace ne­go­ti­a­tions strug­gle to move for­ward and fight­ing erupts fre­quently.</p>
    <p>The lat­est clashes on Sun­day saw Azer­bai­jan and Ar­me­nian sep­a­ratists ac­cuse each other of ig­nit­ing the fight­ing that left both sides with ca­su­al­ties, in­clud­ing civil­ians. It fol­lowed a flareup along the bor­der in July which claimed the lives of 17 soldiers from both sides.</p>
    <p>In April 2016, some 110 peo­ple were killed in the most se­ri­ous fight­ing in years.</p>
    <p>RE­VOLTS AND DY­NASTY</p>
    <p>Ar­me­nia, a Chris­tian coun­try since the fourth cen­tury, has been rocked by po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic in­sta­bil­ity since it gained in­de­pen­dence from the for­mer USSR.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s post-Soviet l ead­er­ship re­pressed op­po­si­tion to its rule, was ac­cused of fal­si­fy­ing bal­lot re­sults, and was largely be­holden to the in­ter­ests of Rus­sia. Mass street protests in 2018 brought cur­rent Prime Min­is­ter Nikol Pashinyan to power. He has since cracked down on cor­rup­tion and in­tro­duced pop­u­lar ju­di­cial re­forms.</p>
    <p>Mus­lim-ma­jor­ity Azer­bai­jan, on the Caspian Sea, has been un­der the au­thor­i­tar­ian grip of a sin­gle fam­ily since 1993. Mr Hey­dar Aliyev, a for­mer of­fi­cer of the Soviet se­cu­rity ser­vices, the KGB, ruled the coun­try with an iron fist un­til Oc­to­ber 2003. He handed over power to his son Il­ham weeks be­fore his death.</p>
    <p>Like his fa­ther, Mr Il­ham has quashed all op­po­si­tion to his rule and in 2017 made his wife, Mehriban, the coun­try’s first vice-pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>RUS­SIA AND TURKEY</p>
    <p>Turkey, with am­bi­tions to be a re­gional power bro­ker in the Cau­ca­sus, has thrown its weight be­hind oil-rich and Tur­kic-speak­ing Azer­bai­jan. Their al­liance is fu­elled by a mu­tual mis­trust of Ar­me­nia, and Ankara rou­tinely is­sues strongly worded state­ments in sup­port of Baku’s am­bi­tions to re­claim Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>
    <p>Yerevan har­bours hos­til­ity to­wards Ankara over the mas­sacre of some 1.5 mil­lion Ar­me­ni­ans by Turkey un­der the Ot­toman Em­pire dur­ing World War I. More than 30 coun­tries have recog­nised the killings as geno­cide, al­though Turkey fiercely dis­putes the term.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia, which main­tains close ties with Ar­me­nia, is the ma­jor power bro­ker in the re­gion. It leads the Col­lec­tive Se­cu­rity Treaty Or­gan­i­sa­tion mil­i­tary al­liance of for­mer Soviet coun­tries that in­cludes Ar­me­nia. Yerevan re­lies on Rus­sian sup­port and mil­i­tary guar­an­tees be­cause its de­fence bud­get is over­shad­owed by Azer­bai­jan’s spend­ing on arms.</p>
    <p>OIL AND DI­AS­PORA</p>
    <p>Azer­bai­jan has re­cently be­gun lever­ag­ing oil rev­enues as part of an at­tempt to over­haul its im­age in the West. It has also tried to pitch it­self to Euro­pean coun­tries as an al­ter­na­tive en­ergy sup­plier to Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>Baku has in­vested in mas­sive spon­sor­ship deals in­clud­ing with the Euro 2020 football cham­pi­onship, which was post­poned be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. Azer­bai­jan has held For­mula 1 Grand Prix races since 2016.</p>
    <p>On the in­ter­na­tional stage, Ar­me­nia has a vast and in­flu­en­tial di­as­pora that fled dur­ing the Ot­toman-era re­pres­sions.</p>
    <p>Re­al­ity TV star Kim Kar­dashian, the late singer Charles Az­navour, and pop star and ac­tress Cher all trace their roots to Ar­me­nia. Some have ap­pointed them­selves un­of­fi­cial am­bas­sadors, like Ms Kar­dashian, who has been out­spo­ken on the is­sue of the Ar­me­nian geno­cide.</p>
    <p>The Soviet au­thor­i­ties merged the pre­dom­i­nantly eth­nic Ar­me­nian ter­ri­tory with Azer­bai­jan in 1921. Af­ter the 1991 col­lapse of the Soviet Union, Ar­me­nian sep­a­ratists seized it in a move sup­ported by Yerevan. An en­su­ing war left 30,000 peo­ple dead and forced hun­dreds of thou­sands from their homes.</p>
