    <p>It took only eight min­utes for a free­hold prop­erty in Toh Tuck Road to be sold for $3.4 mil­lion in a vir­tual auc­tion held by real es­tate agency ERA Sin­ga­pore on Mon­day. Eight prop­er­ties were of­fered for sale at ERA’s first vir­tual auc­tion event, but only the house in Toh Tuck Road was sold.</p>
    <p>It took only eight min­utes for a 21/ 2- storey semi-de­tached house in Toh Tuck Road to be sold for $3.4 mil­lion in a vir­tual auc­tion.</p>
    <p>The free­hold prop­erty at 69 Toh Tuck Road, which has a land area of 3,340 sq ft, was “fiercely con­tested” at real es­tate agency ERA Sin­ga­pore’s first vir­tual auc­tion event on Mon­day, said the agency in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Bid­ding be­gan at $3 mil­lion. Four groups of buy­ers made a to­tal of 15 bids, with the last seven bids put up in the three min­utes be­fore the ham­mer fell at $3.4 mil­lion, or $1,017 per sq ft (psf), said ERA.</p>
    <p>The house went to a Sin­ga­porean fam­ily who bought it for their own use, said ERA. The fam­ily de­clined to be in­ter­viewed.</p>
    <p>It was a mort­gagee sale and the seller was a lo­cal bank. Mort­gagee sales re­fer to prop­er­ties that are re­pos­sessed by banks and fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions when the buy­ers de­fault on their loans. The bank can then sell them on the open mar­ket to re­cover the out­stand­ing amount.</p>
    <p>Eight prop­er­ties – five res­i­den­tial, two com­mer­cial and one in­dus­trial – were of­fered for sale at the vir­tual auc­tion, but only the house in Toh Tuck Road was sold.</p>
    <p>The house, which is near Beauty World MRT sta­tion, was de­scribed by ERA as a “ideal” free­hold prop­erty for “ad­di­tion and al­ter­ation works”, or “for home own­ers to imag­ine a brand-new home with the lo­ca­tion”.</p>
    <p>Last July, a neigh­bour­ing 3,380 sq ft house at 69A Toh Tuck Road was sold at $4.1 mil­lion, or $1,214 psf.</p>
    <p>More than 50 par­tic­i­pants at­tended the 40-minute vir­tual auc­tion on Mon­day. This was dou­ble the usual num­ber at in-per­son auc­tion events.</p>
    <p>On the in­crease in at­ten­dees, ERA Sin­ga­pore’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Jack Chua said: “Be­ing able to shift our auc­tion on­line brings more ease and con­ve­nience to in­ter­ested par­tic­i­pants by widen­ing their ca­pa­bil­ity to join the auc­tion any time, any­where they are.”</p>
    <p>ERA’s phys­i­cal auc­tions were held once a month un­til they were sus­pended in April due to cir­cuit breaker mea­sures, but will re­sume this month with safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures in place.</p>
    <p>To buy a prop­erty at an auc­tion, a down pay­ment of ei­ther 5 per cent or 10 per cent has to be paid and a con­di­tion of sales, which is equiv­a­lent to a sales and pur­chase agree­ment, must be signed im­me­di­ately upon suc­cess­ful bid­ding.</p>
    <p>Mr Chua said: “As auc­tions usu­ally in­clude forced sale or re­pos­sessed prop­er­ties by banks, re­ceivers or by court or­ders, buy­ers may be drawn to such auc­tions for some good deals.”</p>
    <p>The price per sq ft of the prop­erty at 69 Toh Tuck Road. The free­hold prop­erty has a land area of 3,340 sq ft.</p>
