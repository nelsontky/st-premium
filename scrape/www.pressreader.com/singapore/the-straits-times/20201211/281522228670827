    <p>At 60, most peo­ple are busy plan­ning their re­tire­ment. But en­gi­neer Cle­ment Ng Cheng Chuan de­cided to make a ca­reer switch at that age and be­came a nurse.</p>
    <p>Re­trenched after more than 30 years in the oil and gas in­dus­try, Mr Ng felt he was not ready to re­tire. The fa­ther of three adult chil­dren wanted to do some­thing mean­ing­ful.</p>
    <p>He en­rolled in a two-year pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­gramme (PCP) for reg­is­tered nurses in 2017, and started study­ing for a nurs­ing diploma. He com­pleted the pro­gramme last year.</p>
    <p>“I felt that I still had more to con­trib­ute and it is bet­ter to do some­thing rather than sit at home,” said the now 63-year-old, who works as a staff nurse at St Luke’s Hos­pi­tal in Bukit Ba­tok car­ing for the el­derly.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng now spends his time en­sur­ing pa­tients re­ceive the right med­i­ca­tion, look­ing after their well­be­ing and fol­low­ing up on doc­tors’ or­ders. “It can be quite busy. We can­not pre­dict what could hap­pen next, so we need to re­act to sit­u­a­tions fast,” he said.</p>
    <p>His in­ter­est in a nurs­ing ca­reer in­creased after a three-month stint as a health­care as­sis­tant at a hos­pi­tal in 2017.</p>
    <p>He later de­cided to pur­sue a PCP for reg­is­tered nurses, where he stud­ied top­ics such as the hu­man anatomy and picked up life­sav­ing skills such as car­diopul­monary re­sus­ci­ta­tion and au­to­mated ex­ter­nal de­fib­ril­la­tion pro­ce­dures.</p>
    <p>His fam­ily was con­cerned he might not be able to cope with the work at his age, but he man­aged to con­vince them not to worry. “They sup­ported my de­ci­sion and en­cour­aged me,” said Mr Ng, who hopes to work for as long as he is able to.</p>
    <p>He noted that age is not a bar­rier for those who want to take up a ca­reer in the health­care sec­tor.</p>
    <p>“It is re­ward­ing when the fam­i­lies ap­pre­ci­ate what we have done for their loved ones,” he said.</p>
