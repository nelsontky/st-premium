    <p>BRUS­SELS • The Euro­pean Union’s top diplo­mat has said that Rus­sian pub­lic me­dia had spread false in­for­ma­tion on Euro­pean and Amer­i­can Covid-19 vac­cines in coun­tries where it wants to sell its own shot against the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>“Western vac­cine de­vel­op­ers are openly mocked on mul­ti­lin­gual Rus­sian state-con­trolled me­dia, which has in some cases led to ab­surd claims that vac­cines will turn peo­ple into mon­keys,” Mr Josep Bor­rell said in a blog post.</p>
    <p>“Such nar­ra­tives are ap­par­ently di­rected at coun­tries where Rus­sia wants to sell its own vac­cine, Sput­nik V,” Mr Bor­rell said, not­ing that these moves threat­ened pub­lic health amid the pan­demic. He gave no spe­cific ex­am­ples.</p>
    <p>Moscow has re­peat­edly de­nied these ac­cu­sa­tions, and al­leges that Sput­nik V is be­ing tar­geted by a for­eign-backed dis­in­for­ma­tion cam­paign.</p>
    <p>The Rus­sian Di­rect In­vest­ment Fund, which is re­spon­si­ble for mar­ket­ing the vac­cine abroad, did not re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment on Mr Bor­rell’s state­ment, and Roskom­nad­zor, the Rus­sian me­dia and com­mu­ni­ca­tions watch­dog, also did not re­spond.</p>
    <p>When drug­maker As­traZeneca, which worked with Ox­ford Univer­sity on its vac­cine, paused a clin­i­cal trial in Septem­ber due to the then</p>
    <p>un­ex­plained ill­ness of a vol­un­teer, Krem­lin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told re­porters that Sput­nik V was more re­li­able be­cause it was based on an ade­n­ovirus found in hu­mans, whereas the Bri­tish can­di­date was a “mon­key vac­cine”.</p>
    <p>Tri­als of the vac­cine, which uses a bio­engi­neered ver­sion of a harm­less com­mon cold virus found in chim­panzees to in­struct hu­man cells to make anti­gens, were re</p>
    <p>sumed in Bri­tain, within days after get­ting the green light from safety watch­dogs.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia last week dis­patched its first batch of coro­n­avirus vac­cine to Ar­gentina as part of a 10-mil­lion-dose deal. It has signed sup­ply deals with a num­ber of other Latin Amer­i­can and Asian coun­tries. The Rus­sian shot costs less than US$20 (S$26.60) per per­son for the nec­es­sary two doses.</p>
