    <p>SUVA • Su­per cy­clone Yasa flat­tened en­tire vil­lages as it tore through Fiji, aid agen­cies said yes­ter­day, with a baby among two con­firmed deaths and res­cue work­ers rac­ing to the worst-hit ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Yasa made land­fall at the Pa­cific Is­land na­tion late on Thurs­day as a top-of-the-scale Cat­e­gory Five cy­clone, lash­ing Fiji’s sec­ond-largest is­land, Vanua Levu.</p>
    <p>The storm trig­gered floods, land­slides and black­outs be­fore mov­ing out to sea early yes­ter­day, where it rapidly weak­ened to a Cat­e­gory Three sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Mr Zalim Hus­sein of Savusavu, a small town of a few thou­sand peo­ple on Vanua Levu, said he feared for his life shel­ter­ing at home in the dark as screech­ing winds ripped apart houses around him.</p>
    <p>“I could hear roofs of neigh­bour­ing houses fly­ing, trees fall­ing and branches break­ing out­side, and big waves crash­ing on the shore,” he said. “We were all scared for our lives and I thought at one point we’d lose our home. In my 65 years, I’ve never seen any­thing like this.”</p>
    <p>Fiji Prime Min­is­ter Frank Bain­i­marama said two deaths had been con­firmed – a 45-year-old man and a three-month-old baby.</p>
    <p>“We sadly ex­pect fa­tal­i­ties to rise,” he said.</p>
    <p>Most dwellings in ru­ral Fiji are made from tim­ber and cor­ru­gated iron sheet­ing, and are not made to with­stand winds like those un­leashed by Yasa, which had been fore­cast to bring gusts of up to 345kmh.</p>
    <p>“Quite a few vil­lages are re­port­ing that all homes have been de­stroyed,” Save the Chil­dren’s Fiji chief Shairana Ali said.</p>
    <p>“Most of th­ese peo­ple rely on farm­ing for their liveli­hood and their crops have been de­stroyed as well.”</p>
    <p>The Red Cross said it was scram­bling re­sponse teams amid “ex­ten­sive de­struc­tion” in Vanua Levu’s Bua re­gion and coastal com­mu­ni­ties in­un­dated by storm surges.</p>
    <p>Aid agen­cies had pre-po­si­tioned sup­plies across the coun­try in an­tic­i­pa­tion of ma­jor dis­as­ters dur­ing the cy­clone sea­son, which runs un­til May.</p>
    <p>Mr Bain­i­marama said there were about 24,000 peo­ple tak­ing shel­ter in al­most 500 evac­u­a­tion cen­tres across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>A long-time cam­paigner for cli­mate ac­tion, he blamed global warm­ing for cre­at­ing the re­cent mon­ster storms.</p>
    <p>A na­tion­wide state of emer­gency was de­clared on Thurs­day, giv­ing emer­gency ser­vices sweep­ing pow­ers to im­pose cur­fews and move­ment re­stric­tions for the next 30 days.</p>
    <p>Yasa is the third Cat­e­gory Five storm to hit Fiji since 2016, when Cy­clone Win­ston killed 44 peo­ple and de­stroyed tens of thou­sands of homes.</p>
    <p>The most re­cent was Cy­clone Harold, which claimed 31 lives as it tracked through the Solomon Is­lands, Van­u­atu, Fiji and Tonga in April this year.</p>
    <p>“It’s dev­as­tat­ing to see an­other big cy­clone af­fect Fiji so soon af­ter Cy­clone Harold and so close to Christ­mas,” the Red Cross’ Suvabased Pa­cific chief Kathryn Clark­son said. “With com­mu­ni­ties that are al­ready fac­ing chal­lenges be­cause of Covid-19, this will only add to the hard­ships.”</p>
