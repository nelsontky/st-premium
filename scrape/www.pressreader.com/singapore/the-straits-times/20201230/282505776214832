    <p>NEO SWEE LIN, 47</p>
    <p>What is a habit or hobby you picked up this year? To­gether with my hus­band Lim Kay Siu, I got into the habit of live-stream­ing on­line ev­ery day since late May, singing and telling sto­ries with our ukule­les.</p>
    <p>We started sim­ply be­cause I saw a but­ton on In­sta­gram that said “Live”. It was also partly a way to keep in touch with my cousins and their chil­dren while stay­ing at home.</p>
    <p>My hus­band and I are the­atre ac­tors, and all theatres were closed when the cir­cuit breaker hap­pened. We had never tried stream­ing, so we didn’t know what to ex­pect.</p>
    <p>Now, we have a lit­tle on­line com­mu­nity that we call The NeoKeleLim­s Social Club, con­sist­ing of some of my cousins and other peo­ple who have fol­lowed us from In­sta­gram and Face­book, and now from an in­ter­na­tional live mu­sic plat­form called Ses­sions Live.</p>
    <p>We go on­line daily at 5pm, hop­ing to spread some cheer dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic. It has be­come a habit that saved us from go­ing stir-crazy.</p>
    <p>What is your New Year’s res­o­lu­tion?</p>
    <p>To be kinder and more pa­tient. With ev­ery­thing and ev­ery­one, in­clud­ing my­self.</p>
    <p>A friend al­ways used to tell me that I was too hard on my­self and that I should give my­self a break. I am only be­gin­ning to re­alise the wis­dom of that.</p>
