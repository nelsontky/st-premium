    <p>In June, na­tional sports agency Sport Sin­ga­pore (SportSG) closed all Ac­tiveSG in­door sport halls for a day af­ter a group of bad­minton play­ers, in­clud­ing a Covid-19 pa­tient, flouted safe man­age­ment mea­sures (Virus rules flouted: ‘Time-out’ to­day at all Ac­tiveSG in­door sport halls, June 28).</p>
    <p>And in July, SportSG sus­pended the Ac­tiveSG mem­ber­ship ac­counts of the 29 peo­ple who flouted the mea­sures, and warned that it would “act against er­rant users who have in­fringed the reg­u­la­tions”, in­clud­ing bar­ring them from the use of Ac­tiveSG fa­cil­i­ties (Ac­tiveSG ac­counts of 29 rule break­ers sus­pended,</p>
    <p>July 30)</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the bad­minton fra­ter­nity in Sin­ga­pore have gen­er­ally ad­hered to the safe man­age­ment mea­sures spelt out, in­clud­ing hav­ing no more than five peo­ple to a court and no more than four peo­ple on the court at any one time.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day at Jurong East Sports Hall, I saw that two courts had seven peo­ple on each court.</p>
    <p>I high­lighted this to Ac­tiveSG per­son­nel, who in­formed me that man­age­ment was aware of it and that it was al­lowed.</p>
    <p>I said this was in vi­o­la­tion of its own mea­sures and govern­ment reg­u­la­tions, but no ac­tion was taken.</p>
    <p>I learnt that the ac­tiv­ity with two coaches and numer­ous chil­dren was part of a hol­i­day camp pro­gramme or­gan­ised by Ac­tiveSG.</p>
    <p>This was ap­par­ently not the only time that this has hap­pened. The staff told me they had high­lighted this in­fringe­ment of reg­u­la­tions to their man­age­ment, but no ac­tion was taken on pre­vi­ous oc­ca­sions.</p>
    <p>When I went af­ter my bad­minton game to speak with the man­age­ment, the two coaches were in the of­fice com­plain­ing about how I had tried to dis­rupt the coach­ing. Every­one in a po­si­tion of author­ity at Ac­tiveSG that I spoke to brushed me off.</p>
    <p>How can the peo­ple charged with main­tain­ing safety and or­der brush off valid feed­back? Is this hap­pen­ing at other hol­i­day camps or­gan­ised by Ac­tiveSG across the is­land?</p>
    <p>How can you in­stil good sport­ing val­ues when you are not lead­ing by ex­am­ple? How can a govern­ment-linked or­gan­i­sa­tion flout the rules while im­pos­ing them with an iron fist on the pub­lic and ex­ter­nal coaches?</p>
