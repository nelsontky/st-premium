    <p>Shut­downs, salary cuts and staff de­par­tures – most food and bev­er­age (F&B) busi­nesses would have been all too fa­mil­iar with th­ese dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>At restau­rant Wakanui Grill Din­ing, busi­ness plum­meted al­most overnight when the cir­cuit breaker be­gan on April 7. It was a huge chal­lenge, said restau­rant man­ager Ray­mond San­tos, 36. “It af­fected the mo­rale of the team greatly.”</p>
    <p>What has helped ease the blow, he said, are ini­tia­tives like Hi5SG, a na­tion­wide din­ing cam­paign cre­ated to unite F&B op­er­a­tors and sup­port busi­ness re­cov­ery dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Wakanui, along with its sis­ter restau­rants The Spot and Perch, all of which are owned by life­style and hospi­tal­ity group 1855 F&B, are par­tic­i­pants in Hi5SG.</p>
    <p>First started in Septem­ber, the non-profit cam­paign will run till next April.</p>
    <p>It aims to woo din­ers back to restau­rants by en­cour­ag­ing par­tic­i­pat­ing busi­nesses to roll out spe­cial din­ing ex­pe­ri­ences with the num­ber five as a theme – $5 off the Sig­na­ture Bos­ton Lob­ster Co­conut Laksa at Perch, for ex­am­ple, or a $55++ set menu at The Spot.</p>
    <p>The num­ber five al­ludes to the five-per­son din­ing rule that was put in place dur­ing Phase 2 of Covid-19 mea­sures, as well as Sin­ga­pore’s 55th birth­day this year.</p>
    <p>Hi5SG was con­ceived dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker by Ms Lyla Lin, 33, and Ms Lynn Yeow-De Vito, 40, founders of bou­tique com­mu­ni­ca­tions agency Loop PR, which spe­cialises in F&B and hospi­tal­ity.</p>
    <p>Ms Lin, said: “We started to ask our­selves: How are F&B busi­nesses go­ing to re­cover from their losses suf­fered dur­ing the months of the cir­cuit breaker?”</p>
    <p>The duo are also com­mu­nity lead­ers in #savefnbsg, a coali­tion of more than 500 restau­rants that banded to­gether dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker to sup­port each other by shar­ing in­for­ma­tion and re­sources.</p>
    <p>They did not ex­pect Hi5SG to gain trac­tion in the way that it has. “Ini­tially, we thought of shar­ing our idea with five restau­rant groups and get­ting them to come to­gether for five months,” said Ms Lin.</p>
    <p>Hi5SG has since grown to in­clude around 150 restau­rants, with most com­mit­ting to the ini­tia­tive for three to four months.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery month, an av­er­age of 50 restau­rants come on board the pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive, which is sup­ported by En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore and the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board, also aims to give back to the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Part of the pro­ceeds from the Hi5SG din­ing ex­pe­ri­ences – rang­ing from $1 to $5 – will be do­nated to =Dreams, an ed­u­ca­tional pro­gramme for un­der­priv­i­leged chil­dren who stay in a =Dreams fa­cil­ity dur­ing the school week and re­turn home on week­ends and school hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>Hi5SG aims to raise $300,000 for =Dreams, which is the sis­ter or­gan­i­sa­tion of South Cen­tral Com­mu­nity Fam­ily Ser­vice Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Ms Yeow-De Vito, who is also on =Dreams’ char­ity board, said: “We be­lieve that it is vi­tal to step up ef­forts to give peo­ple a bet­ter chance of hav­ing a ful­fill­ing life with ed­u­ca­tion.”</p>
