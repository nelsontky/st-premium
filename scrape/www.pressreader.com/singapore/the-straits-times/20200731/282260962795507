    <p>TOKYO • Next year’s Olympics could be held in front of a “lim­ited num­ber of spec­ta­tors” to pre­vent the spread of Covid-19 in­fec­tion, Tokyo 2020 chief ex­ec­u­tive Toshiro Muto has said.</p>
    <p>The post­poned Tokyo Games are sched­uled to open on July 23 next year and Muto told BBC Sports that or­gan­is­ers were com­mit­ted to hold­ing the event then, and there had been no dis­cus­sion of can­celling or post­pon­ing it fur­ther.</p>
    <p>“Every­one should fo­cus on hold­ing the event next year – we’re on the same page,” he said, adding that In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee (IOC) chief Thomas Bach was “not look­ing for” a Games held with­out any fans, but ac­knowl­edged smaller au­di­ences might be pos­si­ble. “He vid­ing ser­vices – state-of-the-art train­ing fa­cil­i­ties, top coaches and sports sci­en­tists, ac­cess to sports psy­chol­o­gists – that seem­ingly led to medals.</p>
    <p>To ath­letes, sup­port should have evolved by now into some­thing more holis­tic that in­cluded car­ing for their men­tal health in ways be­yond the sports psy­chol­o­gists who fo­cused on prim­ing their minds for com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>“We have to ed­u­cate peo­ple that men­tal health is not a weak­ness,” said Katie Uh­laen­der, a four-time Win­ter Olympian in skele­ton who is among the ath­letes pro­filed in the film.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers in­clude Steven Hol­comb, a bob­sled cham­pion who died alone at the Olympic Train­ing Cen­tre in New York of an over­dose of sleep­ing pills and al­co­hol in 2017; the fig­ure skaters Sasha Co­hen and Gra­cie Gold; and Jeret Peter­son, an aerial may be think­ing about a lim­ited num­ber of spec­ta­tors with full con­sid­er­a­tion of so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>“We must build an en­vi­ron­ment where peo­ple feel safe. Ath­letes and the IOC fam­ily may re­quire test­ing be­fore/after en­ter­ing Ja­pan and skier who killed him­self in 2011.</p>
    <p>Uh­laen­der and oth­ers say there is a dire need for ath­letes to have eas­ier ac­cess to ther­apy that does not in­volve go­ing through the coaches and high per­for­mance staff – peo­ple who each year eval­u­ate their fit­ness for com­pe­ti­tion and mem­ber­ship on the na­tional team and who might pe­nalise an ath­lete they know has needed help deal­ing with men­tal ill­ness.</p>
    <p>The USOPC has tried to move in this di­rec­tion. More ath­letes have ac­cess to un­lim­ited phone coun­selling and six in-per­son ther­apy ses­sions with a li­censed pro­fes­sional through the em­ployee as­sis­tance com­pany ComPsych. The ben­e­fit was ex­tended this year to some 4,400 ath­letes, more than three times the num­ber be­fore the coro­n­avirus pan­demic caused the post­pone­ment of the Tokyo Olympics to next year. (we need) strong med­i­cal sys­tems around ac­com­mo­da­tion and trans­porta­tion plans.”</p>
    <p>Ja­pan cur­rently bans vis­i­tors from more than 100 coun­tries in a bid to limit the spread of the coro­n­avirus and Muto said it was “too op­ti­mistic to as­sume all re­stric­tions will be gone, so we must think of other ways”.</p>
    <p>With just un­der a year to go un­til the post­poned Games, Ja­panese cit­i­zens have ex­pressed scep­ti­cism about whether the Olympics can or should be held.</p>
    <p>Two polls this month found the ma­jor­ity of Ja­panese think the Games should be post­poned again or can­celled.</p>
