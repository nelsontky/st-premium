    <p>NEW YORK • United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump joked to the for­mer White House press sec­re­tary, Ms Sarah San­ders, about her “tak­ing one for the team” af­ter North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un winked at her dur­ing a sum­mit in Sin­ga­pore in 2018.</p>
    <p>Ms San­ders writes about the episode in her book, Speak­ing For My­self, in which she dis­cusses her time work­ing for Mr Trump, as well as how she may run for gover­nor of her home state of Arkansas and her early days car­ing for young chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Through­out, Ms San­ders writes glow­ingly about her for­mer boss.</p>
    <p>Ex­cerpts from the book, which goes on sale next Tues­day, were pro­vided to The New York Times.</p>
    <p>Ms San­ders de­scribes the his­toric sum­mit in Sin­ga­pore be­tween Mr Trump and Mr Kim in de­tail, in­clud­ing a mo­ment where she and the North Korean leader “made di­rect eye con­tact and Kim nod­ded and ap­peared to wink at me”.</p>
    <p>She de­scribed her­self as stunned. “I quickly looked down and con­tin­ued tak­ing notes and for the rest of the meet­ing only looked up from my notes in the di­rec­tion of the US del­e­ga­tion,” she writes.</p>
    <p>On the trip back to Air Force One, Ms San­ders re­layed the en­counter with Mr Kim to Mr Trump and the White House chief of staff at the time, Mr John Kelly.</p>
    <p>The two men burst out laugh­ing, Ms San­ders writes.</p>
    <p>“Kim winked at you?” Mr Trump asked, adding, “Are you telling me Kim Jong Un hit on you!?!?”</p>
    <p>Ms San­ders made clear she did not mean that, but Mr Trump and Mr Kelly con­tin­ued to joke about Mr Kim’s in­ten­tions.</p>
    <p>“Well, Sarah, that set­tles it,” Ms San­ders re­calls the Pres­i­dent jok­ing. “You’re go­ing to North Korea and tak­ing one for the team! Your hus­band and kids will miss you, but you’ll be a hero to your coun­try!”</p>
    <p>At an­other point dur­ing the sum­mit, Ms San­ders writes, Mr Trump un­nerved Mr Kim when he of­fered him a Tic Tac sweet.</p>
    <p>“Kim, con­fused, and prob­a­bly con­cerned it was an at­tempt to poi­son him, wasn’t sure how to re­spond,” Ms San­ders writes.</p>
    <p>“The Pres­i­dent dra­mat­i­cally blew into the air to re­as­sure Kim it was just a breath mint and took a few from the box and popped them into his mouth. Kim re­luc­tantly ac­cepted the Tic Tac from Pres­i­dent Trump and ate it.”</p>
    <p>TAK­ING ONE FOR THE TEAM</p>
    <p>You’re go­ing to North Korea and tak­ing one for the team! Your hus­band and kids will miss you, but you’ll be a hero to your coun­try!</p>
