    <p>SAN FRAN­CISCO Golden State War­riors star Klay Thomp­son was ruled out of the en­tire 2020-21 Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) sea­son af­ter suf­fer­ing a torn Achilles ten­don, the team said on Thurs­day, in a shat­ter­ing blow to the five-time All-Star who was bid­ding to re­turn af­ter a year-long in­jury ab­sence.</p>
    <p>Thomp­son – who missed all of last sea­son af­ter a knee in­jury sus­tained in the NBA Fi­nals last year – had limped out of a work­out on Wed­nes­day. An MRI scan on Thurs­day con­firmed the 30-year-old tore his right Achilles ten­don.</p>
    <p>He was a key part of the War­riors team who dom­i­nated the league with five straight runs to the NBA Fi­nals and ti­tles in 2015, 2017 and 2018. With­out him, and af­ter team­mate Stephen Curry was side­lined for four months with a bro­ken hand, the War­riors fin­ished last in the West­ern Con­fer­ence last sea­son.</p>
    <p>War­riors gen­eral man­ager Bob My­ers said the fran­chise had been left in shock about the guard’s lat­est in­jury blow. Speak­ing to re­porters on Thurs­day, he de­scribed the scene when he learnt of the news of Thomp­son’s in­jury.</p>
    <p>“These are those phone calls when the colour drains from your face,” a sub­dued My­ers said. “I got a mes­sage from his agent that said ‘Hey, Klay might have in­jured him­self. Call me’.”</p>
    <p>My­ers said Thomp­son’s close friends and team­mates Curry and Dray­mond Green had been stunned into si­lence when he called with the news.</p>
    <p>“Some­times words don’t do it,” he said. “It’s not news you want to break on the phone. There was a lot of si­lence.”</p>
    <p>But he backed Thomp­son to even­tu­ally re­turn from the in­jury, even if by the time he sets foot on a court again, it is likely to be more than two years since he last played.</p>
    <p>“Klay will keep play­ing,” he said. “He has a strength of will but right now it’s a tough day for him. This is a guy that loves bas­ket­ball, that bleeds bas­ket­ball.”</p>
    <p>A ca­reer 41.9 per cent shooter from three-point range, Thomp­son av­er­aged 21.5 points a game dur­ing the 2018-19 cam­paign, his last full sea­son with the team.</p>
    <p>Even though it was clear that he would miss the sub­se­quent sea­son, the War­riors still signed him to a five-year US$190 mil­lion (S$255.3 mil­lion) con­tract at the start of free agency in July last year, bank­ing on the be­lief that he would re­turn to full health. But he has yet to play a game on his new deal.</p>

The guard will miss the new sea&#xAD;son start&#xAD;ing next month af&#xAD;ter in&#xAD;jur&#xAD;ing his Achilles ten&#xAD;don on Wed&#xAD;nes&#xAD;day.</p>
