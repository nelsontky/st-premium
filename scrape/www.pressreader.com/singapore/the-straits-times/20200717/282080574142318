    <p>Twin red ruffed lemur ba­bies were born at the Sin­ga­pore Zoo on Feb 22.</p>
    <p>The lemur ba­bies, which have not been named yet, are al­most five months old and have be­gun to wel­come vis­i­tors fol­low­ing the zoo’s re­open­ing on July 6.</p>
    <p>“(The twins) can of­ten be spot­ted en­joy­ing meals with their par­ents at (the zoo),” the Wildlife Re­serves Sin­ga­pore (WRS) said in a video it posted on Face­book yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The last time the zoo wel­comed the birth of the crit­i­cally en­dan­gered red ruffed lemur was 11 years ago when the twins’ fa­ther, Bosco, was born.</p>
    <p>His mate, eight-year-old Min­nie, ar­rived i n Sin­ga­pore Zoo from Ja­pan in 2016.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple were spe­cially matched for con­ser­va­tion breed­ing be­cause of their com­pat­i­bil­ity, said the WRS.</p>
    <p>“Re­pro­duc­tion for these rust­coloured pri­mates is no­to­ri­ously dif­fi­cult as they breed only once a year,” the re­serve said.</p>
    <p>“On top of this, fe­males are fer­tile for only one out of the few days they are sex­u­ally re­cep­tive, mak­ing this twin birth par­tic­u­larly spe­cial.”</p>
    <p>With the new ad­di­tions, there are now five red ruffed lemurs, 12 ring­tailed lemurs and three black and white ruffed lemurs at the zoo.</p>
    <p>Red ruffed lemurs are na­tive to north-eastern Mada­gas­car. The big­gest threat they face is habi­tat loss due to il­le­gal log­ging and hunt­ing.</p>
    <p>There are be­tween 29,000 and 52,000 red ruffed lemurs left in the wild.</p>
    <p>They are a sis­ter species to the black and white ruffed lemurs na­tive to eastern Mada­gas­car.</p>
    <p>Even though the two species do not co-ex­ist in the same ge­o­graph­i­cal range, they are able to un­der­stand each other’s calls and com­mu­ni­cate.</p>
