    <p>In­dia re­ported a record daily jump of 69,652 coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, tak­ing the to­tal case count in the coun­try to 2.84 mil­lion, Health Min­istry data showed. In­dia is also star­ing at a pro­tracted slow­down as in­fec­tions reach the coun­try­side, de­spite signs of re­cov­ery in the ru­ral econ­omy.</p>
    <p>BENGALURU/NEW DELHI • In­dia re­ported a record daily jump of 69,652 coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions yes­ter­day, tak­ing the to­tal case count in the coun­try to 2.84 mil­lion, data from the Health Min­istry showed.</p>
    <p>As of last night, the num­ber had pushed past 2.85 mil­lion and the death toll stood at over 54,000. In­dia is the worst-hit coun­try in Asia and third glob­ally be­hind the US and Brazil in terms of case num­bers.</p>
    <p>In­dia is also star­ing at a pro­tracted slow­down as in­fec­tions reach the coun­try­side, with signs of re­cov­ery in the ru­ral econ­omy hailed by Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi be­ing “at best a mit­i­gat­ing fac­tor”, said gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials and an­a­lysts.</p>
    <p>The world’s No. 5 econ­omy will re­port first-quar­ter gross do­mes­tic prod­uct data on Aug 31. Ac­cord­ing to a Reuters poll, there was likely a 20 per cent con­trac­tion in the April to June pe­riod. The econ­omy is also fore­cast to shrink 5.1 per cent in the year to March next year, the weak­est per­for­mance since 1979.</p>
    <p>Nearly half of In­dia’s 1.38 bil­lion peo­ple rely on agri­cul­ture to sur­vive, with the sec­tor ac­count­ing for 15 per cent of eco­nomic out­put.</p>
    <p>Mr Modi has been cit­ing higher fer­tiliser de­mand and the sow­ing of mon­soon crops, both key signs of ru­ral ac­tiv­ity, to show there are “green shoots” in the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>But four gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials said the uptick in ac­tiv­ity may not be as large as be­lieved given a spike in virus cases in ru­ral ar­eas that were ini­tially iso­lated from the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“The eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion has in fact wors­ened since April and May, and we are likely mov­ing to­wards a longer eco­nomic slow­down than ex­pected,” a Fi­nance Min­istry of­fi­cial said, point­ing to slug­gish con­sumer de­mand and a slow­down in ru­ral lend­ing as causes for con­cern.</p>
    <p>A gov­ern­ment ad­viser with knowl­edge of In­dia’s bud­get plans said: “The sit­u­a­tion on the econ­omy front is very se­ri­ous and the gov­ern­ment’s hands are tied on the fis­cal front.”</p>
    <p>Both de­clined to be named as they were not au­tho­rised to speak to the me­dia. A min­istry spokesman de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>Separately, Dr A. Velumani, head of lead­ing pri­vate lab­o­ra­tory Thy­ro­care, said at least one in four peo­ple in In­dia may have been in­fected – much higher than of­fi­cial gov­ern­ment fig­ures sug­gest.</p>
    <p>An anal­y­sis of 270,000 an­ti­body tests done by Thy­ro­care across In­dia showed the pres­ence of an­ti­bod­ies in an av­er­age of 26 per cent of the peo­ple, in­di­cat­ing they had al­ready been ex­posed to the virus, he said.</p>
    <p>“This is a much higher per­cent­age than we had ex­pected. The pres­ence of an­ti­bod­ies is uni­form across all age groups, in­clud­ing chil­dren,” Dr Velumani told Reuters.</p>
    <p>Thy­ro­care’s find­ings are in line with gov­ern­ment sur­veys done in In­dian cities such as Mum­bai, which showed that 57 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion in its crowded slum ar­eas had been ex­posed to the virus. The Thy­ro­care sur­vey cov­ered paid and tested pa­tients in 600 cities in In­dia for the last seven weeks.</p>
    <p>If the trend con­tin­ues, the per­cent­age of In­dia’s pop­u­la­tion hav­ing an­ti­bod­ies may hit 40 per cent be­fore the end of De­cem­ber.</p>
