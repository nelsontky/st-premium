    <p>A is for ar­ti­sanal</p>
    <p>When cousins I-Wen Whang and Jonathan Tang came back to Sin­ga­pore af­ter study­ing and work­ing in the United States, they missed the bagels that are ubiq­ui­tous there. So they de­cided to make their own. And sell them too, fig­ur­ing that oth­ers might also want ar­ti­sanal bagels that are a lit­tle eas­ier on the teeth than com­mer­cial ones. From there was born Able Bagel, which sells bagels with var­i­ous top­pings and also made into elab­o­rate sand­wiches (right) with names like Ahh Le­mak and Lil Nasty.</p>
    <p>They are among the lat­est to join the ar­ti­sanal food move­ment in Sin­ga­pore – brave souls who cham­pion hand­made and from-scratch in a world where warp speed is val­ued above all else.</p>
    <p>There is Lee Yum Hwa of Ben Fatto, who makes pasta in in­tri­cate shapes, us­ing the rolling and cut­ting tools that an Ital­ian nonna might use, and skilled hands. Please con­tinue to sell boxes of pasta di­rect to cus­tomers, so that you can fo­cus on the mak­ing and we can fo­cus on the sauc­ing.</p>
    <p>Think also about Wood­lands Sour­dough in Up­per Thom­son Road, run by Nurhasanah Jo­hari and Chalith Kariyawasa­m, who grew their sour­dough in the sub­urb where they live. They have trav­elled the world to learn more about mak­ing good bread, and their rus­tic, hearty loaves have a firm fol­low­ing among dis­cern­ing eaters here.</p>
    <p>I can­not talk about ar­ti­sanal food with­out wax­ing lyri­cal about Kki Sweets’ cakes. Beau­ti­fully con­structed, never too sweet, flavours all in har­mony. Made by chef Ken­neth Seah. He is self-taught. The cakes are right up there with those of Hidemi Sug­ino in Tokyo’s Ni­hon­bashi and a good deal more de­li­cious and el­e­gant than the wares at A Tes Souhaits in Kichi­joji.</p>
    <p>On the pas­try front is Mo­hamed Al-Matin, his name trans­lat­ing to “morn­ing” in French, the per­fect time of day to in­dulge in his beau­ti­ful vi­en­nois­erie. He worked at Noma in Copen­hagen, but is back in Sin­ga­pore to set up shop. In the mean­time, he is teas­ing his au­di­ence with his so-very-hard-to-get pas­try boxes, sold out min­utes af­ter the or­der­ing win­dow opens.</p>
    <p>Enough al­ready. Open that shop, chef.</p>
