    <p>NEW YORK • The New York Univer­sity (NYU) pro­fes­sor who de­vel­oped one of the best-known for­mu­las for pre­dict­ing cor­po­rate in­sol­ven­cies has a warn­ing for US credit in­vestors: This year’s spate of “mega” bank­rupt­cies is just get­ting started.</p>
    <p>More than 30 Amer­i­can com­pa­nies with li­a­bil­i­ties ex­ceed­ing US$1 bil­lion (S$1.39 bil­lion) have al­ready filed for Chap­ter 11 bank­ruptcy pro­tec­tion since the start of Jan­uary, and that num­ber is likely to top 60 by year end af­ter busi­nesses piled on debt dur­ing the pan­demic, ac­cord­ing to Z-score creator Ed­ward Alt­man, who is pro­fes­sor emer­i­tus at NYU’s Stern School of Busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies glob­ally have sold a record US$2.1 tril­lion (S$2.9 tril­lion) of bonds this year, with nearly half com­ing from US is­suers, data com­piled by Bloomberg shows.</p>
    <p>While the stim­u­lus-fu­elled rally in credit mar­kets since March has helped bor­row­ers stay afloat dur­ing the coro­n­avirus cri­sis, Pro­fes­sor Alt­man and oth­ers have warned that many com­pa­nies are just de­lay­ing an in­evitable reck­on­ing.</p>
    <p>Fitch Rat­ings es­ti­mates world­wide cor­po­rate bond de­faults this year could ex­ceed lev­els reached dur­ing the global re­ces­sion in 2009.</p>
    <p>“There was a huge build-up in cor­po­rate debt by the end of 2019, and I thought the mar­ket would gain some much needed delever­ag­ing with the Covid-19 cri­sis,” said Prof Alt­man, who is also di­rec­tor of credit and debt mar­ket re­search at the NYU Salomon Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>“Now, seems like com­pa­nies again are ex­ploit­ing what seems to be a crazy re­bound.”</p>
    <p>As new waves of the coro­n­avirus keep planes from fly­ing and curb con­sumer spend­ing, pres­sures on the global econ­omy are in­creas­ing.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund down­graded its out­look for the world econ­omy last month, pro­ject­ing a deeper re­ces­sion and slower recovery than it pre­vi­ously an­tic­i­pated.</p>
    <p>Ch­e­sa­peake En­ergy Corp, the pioneer of the shale gas rev­o­lu­tion, and re­tailer Brooks Brothers have filed for bank­ruptcy in the United States in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>De­faults in the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion in­clude Vir­gin Aus­tralia Hold­ings and Shang­hai-head­quar­tered Hi­long Hold­ing, an oil equip­ment and ser­vices firm.</p>
    <p>Man Group, the world’s largest pub­licly listed hedge fund, has warned of the risk to bond buy­ers.</p>
    <p>The World Bank has also fore­cast that more than 90 per cent of economies will ex­pe­ri­ence con­trac­tions this year, higher than the rate seen at the height of the Great De­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>“The speed and mag­ni­tude of the in­crease in cor­po­rate debt this year poses var­i­ous risks to an al­ready frag­ile global eco­nomic out­look,” said Pro­fes­sor Ay­han Kose, di­rec­tor of the World Bank Group’s Prospects Group.</p>
    <p>Coun­tries where a large pro­por­tion of the bor­row­ings are in for­eign cur­ren­cies or for shorter pe­ri­ods are par­tic­u­larly vul­ner­a­ble, as they face risks of fluc­tu­at­ing ex­change rates, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Xavier Jean, se­nior di­rec­tor for cor­po­rate rat­ings at S&P Global Rat­ings, said some com­pa­nies are be­ing proac­tive, as they are un­cer­tain if they can raise funds dur­ing the sec­ond half. But for those that face tremen­dous stress in their op­er­a­tions, the in­creased bor­row­ing height­ens risks if things don’t turn around as quickly, he said.</p>
    <p>In the US, the Fed­eral Re­serve has pro­vided un­prece­dented sup­port, such as buy­ing cor­po­rate bonds, in­clud­ing the debt of com­pa­nies that were cut from in­vest­ment-grade to junk.</p>
    <p>For Prof Alt­man, com­pa­nies are do­ing the op­po­site of what they should be do­ing, which is to delever­age as the banks did af­ter the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis of 2008.</p>
    <p>“When there is an in­crease in in­sol­vency risk, what you do not need is more debt. You need less debt.”</p>
    <p>More than 30 Amer­i­can com­pa­nies with li­a­bil­i­ties ex­ceed­ing US$1 bil­lion (S$1.39 bil­lion) have al­ready filed for Chap­ter 11 bank­ruptcy pro­tec­tion... and that num­ber is likely to top 60 by year end af­ter busi­nesses piled on debt dur­ing the pan­demic, ac­cord­ing to Z-score creator Ed­ward Alt­man, who is pro­fes­sor emer­i­tus at New York Univer­sity’s Stern School of Busi­ness.</p>
