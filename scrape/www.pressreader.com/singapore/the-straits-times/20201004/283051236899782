    <p>All of us will be in two minds about whether it is a good time to buy a prop­erty given the eco­nomic tur­moil we are go­ing through.</p>
    <p>Some have al­ready de­cided: New home sales hit an 11-month high in Au­gust, with 1,227 pri­vate con­do­minium units sold de­spite grow­ing un­em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>If you are buy­ing be­cause you need a home to live in, the an­swer must be “yes” be­cause, un­like other kinds of in­vest­ments, you get to en­joy liv­ing in a new home even if the re­ces­sion is pro­longed.</p>
    <p>If you can af­ford it, the re­ces­sion will en­able you to drive a hard bar­gain to get the seller to of­fer a big­ger dis­count. Also, mort­gage rates are at their low­est in years, at just over 1 per cent at some banks.</p>
    <p>But if you are think­ing of buy­ing for in­vest­ment, think twice un­less you have deep pock­ets.</p>
    <p>This is es­pe­cially so if you plan to lease out the unit and use the rent to pay the mort­gage.</p>
    <p>The re­al­ity is that you may not be able to find ten­ants in this mar­ket un­less you of­fer a big dis­count on the rent, mean­ing you will need ex­tra cash for mort­gage pay­ments.</p>
    <p>Ms Chris­tine Sun of OrangeTee & Tie says: “We have al­ready seen a sub­stan­tial slow­down in rental de­mand over the past few months. Fur­ther, as the cur­rent jobs sup­port schemes are in­tended to help firms re­tain their lo­cal work­force, it is in­evitable that a cut­back in for­eign em­ploy­ment will ad­versely im­pact the leas­ing mar­ket tem­po­rar­ily.”</p>
    <p>Prop­erty an­a­lyst Ong Kah Seng agrees. He says that buy­ers need to be more cau­tious be­cause it is not just whether they can af­ford to buy.</p>
    <p>“You should pur­chase a prop­erty only if you can use it for your own stay, as condo leas­ing de­mand will be in­evitably weak for quite a while,” he says.</p>
    <p>What about buy­ing prop­erty with the hope of cap­i­tal gains down the road? After all, many peo­ple who bought in the past have en­joyed good re­turns.</p>
    <p>Take a buyer who picked up a three-bed­room unit on Sen­tosa in the mid-2000s for about $800,000. That apartment would now be worth $2 mil­lion to $3 mil­lion. Even sub­ur­ban condo units priced around $600,000 then would be worth al­most dou­ble to­day.</p>
    <p>So if you buy a new two-bed­der for $1.5 mil­lion to­day, can you ex­pect to sell it at $2 mil­lion, or even $2.5 mil­lion, in 10 to 15 years?</p>
    <p>You can cer­tainly hope so, but the re­al­ity is this will hap­pen only if the post-pan­demic world sud­denly booms and ev­ery­one’s in­come starts to shoot up.</p>
    <p>As in all cases, the prop­erty mar­ket can see a meteoric rise again only if ev­ery­one’s in­come also rises. But you should not look at past per­for­mances of prop­erty prices as in­di­ca­tors of the fu­ture. Take the re­sale mar­ket to­day. There are many re­sale condo units in prime dis­tricts that have been on sale for the past few years with price tags rang­ing from $1.8 mil­lion to $3 mil­lion. Many of these free­hold con­dos are within walk­ing dis­tance of Or­chard Road.</p>
    <p>Some of the 1,000 sq ft units are sell­ing at about $2.4 mil­lion, which works out to be around $2,400 per sq ft. Con­sid­er­ing that these free­hold units are just a short stroll away from pop­u­lar malls such as Takashimay­a, Ion Or­chard and Paragon, they should give new lease­hold sub­ur­ban units, which are priced at $2,000 or more per sq ft, a run for their money.</p>
    <p>But there are of­ten no tak­ers for many of these good units near</p>
    <p>Or­chard Road.</p>
    <p>There are two rea­sons why these prop­er­ties have re­mained on the mar­ket for the past few years with little change to their ask­ing prices.</p>
    <p>AF­FORD­ABIL­ITY</p>
    <p>Let’s face it. The moment the price goes be­yond $2 mil­lion, many buy­ers will drop out be­cause it will ex­ceed their bud­gets.</p>
    <p>What about the ul­tra-rich buy­ers? Many are not keen on these “small” units as they pre­fer to live in mega ones that prob­a­bly cost $10 mil­lion or more.</p>
    <p>Also, they may be the ones sell­ing these units, which were bought ear­lier at far lower prices.</p>
    <p>So this stale­mate in the $2 mil­lion seg­ment of smaller units raises the ques­tion of whether many of the new smaller $1.5 mil­lion sub­ur­ban condo units that are sold to­day will see their prices rise be­yond $2 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>It is un­likely un­less the earn­ing power of to­day’s young peo­ple ex­ceeds that of their par­ents in a decade or two.</p>
    <p>NEW VS OLD</p>
    <p>As cars in Sin­ga­pore have an “ex­piry date” of 10 years, many Sin­ga­pore­ans have grown used to buy­ing new cars in­stead of se­cond­hand ones.</p>
    <p>This pref­er­ence for new pur­chases has some­how spilled over to prop­erty as well.</p>
    <p>Any young cou­ple asked to pick be­tween a new prop­erty and a re­sale one will likely choose the for­mer even though the lat­ter may be a cheaper and bet­ter deal.</p>
    <p>This begs the ques­tion – if ev­ery­one seems to pre­fer new prop­er­ties, who will then buy to­day’s new units in 10 years?</p>
    <p>And if the de­mand for older prop­er­ties starts to wane, how can own­ers con­tinue to reap cap­i­tal gains?</p>
    <p>Per­haps a par­a­digm shift in the real es­tate mar­ket is needed, with de­vel­op­ers tak­ing a leaf from the book of car dis­trib­u­tors such as Cy­cle & Car­riage and Per­for­mance Mo­tors.</p>
    <p>While par­al­lel im­ports are avail­able, many still choose to buy from au­tho­rised deal­ers be­cause they will con­tinue to ser­vice and re­pair the cars with gen­uine parts.</p>
    <p>With the same busi­ness model in mind, if ma­jor de­vel­op­ers opt to also be the man­ag­ing agent of the prop­er­ties they sell, per­haps it will make their units even more de­sir­able.</p>
    <p>Imag­ine the sce­nario of own­ers turn­ing to the de­vel­oper for all kinds of needs, in­clud­ing ren­o­va­tion, re­pair, main­te­nance and even buy­back of units for re­sale.</p>
    <p>This could pro­vide a sus­tain­able new rev­enue stream for de­vel­op­ers, in­stead of just re­ly­ing on build­ing and sell­ing new units, a process lim­ited by the avail­abil­ity of land.</p>
    <p>So other than just bank­ing on lo­ca­tion, here is a chance to cre­ate a new badge of hon­our – de­vel­op­er­man­aged condo.</p>
    <p>Any young cou­ple asked to pick be­tween a new prop­erty and a re­sale one will likely choose the for­mer even though the lat­ter may be a cheaper and bet­ter deal. This begs the ques­tion – if ev­ery­one seems to pre­fer new prop­er­ties, who will then buy to­day’s new units in 10 years?</p>
