    <p>We be­lieve that me­di­a­tion is a time- and cost-ef­fi­cient means of re­solv­ing dis­putes while pre­serv­ing com­mer­cial re­la­tion­ships. This is es­pe­cially im­por­tant dur­ing this chal­leng­ing pe­riod.</p>
    <p>I think it is good to en­list the help of your me­di­a­tion in­sti­tu­tion. They can of­ten try to fa­cil­i­tate talks that get the me­di­a­tion started, be­fore em­bark­ing on me­di­a­tion proper.</p>
    <p>Me­di­a­tion has en­joyed a re­cent re­nais­sance, par­tic­u­larly fol­low­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic as par­ties seek to re­duce or avoid costs spent on re­solv­ing dis­putes.</p>
    <p>A dis­pute in an Asean coun­try be­tween a de­vel­oper and an ar­chi­tec­tural firm went on for years but me­di­a­tion set­tled the case within a day.</p>
    <p>When all seemed lost and a soured re­la­tion­ship seemed headed for ar­bi­tra­tion after the de­vel­oper had ter­mi­nated the con­tract for al­leged breaches, both par­ties agreed to ex­plore me­di­a­tion first at the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Me­di­a­tion Cen­tre (SIMC).</p>
    <p>The case, cited by SIMC chief ex­ec­u­tive Chuan Wee Meng, un­der­scored the growing im­por­tance of me­di­a­tion as a faster and cheaper way to set­tle com­mer­cial dis­putes.</p>
    <p>“The turn­ing point came when it be­came clear that the dis­pute was not merely about fi­nan­cial com­pen­sa­tion – there was an is­sue of pro­fes­sional recog­ni­tion as well,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve that me­di­a­tion is a time- and cost-ef­fi­cient means of re­solv­ing dis­putes while pre­serv­ing com­mer­cial re­la­tion­ships. This is es­pe­cially im­por­tant dur­ing this chal­leng­ing pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“This is why we launched the SIMC Covid-19 Pro­to­col, which pro­vides an eco­nom­i­cal, ef­fi­cient and ef­fec­tive way for par­ties to re­solve their dis­putes dur­ing this pe­riod.”</p>
    <p>The pro­to­col, which fo­cuses on in­ter­na­tional mat­ters, en­ables busi­nesses to ad­dress dis­putes in a way that is com­mer­cially driven, fu­ture­ori­ented and helps over­come chal­lenges posed by the pan­demic, added Mr Chuan.</p>
    <p>It was de­signed to com­ple­ment leg­is­la­tion on Covid-19. In Sin­ga­pore, par­ties who en­joy re­lief un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act can me­di­ate at any time – even after an as­ses­sor’s de­ter­mi­na­tion.</p>
    <p>“We work with our me­di­a­tors and stake­hold­ers to pro­vide re­duced and fixed rates so that par­ties can re­solve their con­flicts out­side of court through me­di­a­tion. This is our way of con­tribut­ing to the busi­ness com­mu­nity dur­ing this pan­demic,” said Mr Chuan.</p>
    <p>Mr Chuan, who me­di­ated the re­cent case with se­nior lawyer Fran­cis Goh from Harry Elias Part­ner­ship, who is also SIMC am­bas­sador and spe­cial­ist me­di­a­tor, said the dis­pute in­volved a new build­ing project in an Asean coun­try, be­tween a de­vel­oper and an ar­chi­tec­tural firm.</p>
    <p>“While the me­di­a­tion started out an­tag­o­nis­tic be­tween the par­ties, at the end of the me­di­a­tion, the rep­re­sen­ta­tives were en­gaged in friendly con­ver­sa­tion, putting them on the road to rec­on­cil­i­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Mr Chuan added: “The last thing I heard was the de­vel­oper say­ing to the ar­chi­tect, ‘See you next week.</p>
    <p>We will take you to the site to show you the build­ing.’ Ap­par­ently, the ar­chi­tect had not stepped foot onto this award-win­ning devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>“To me, this is what me­di­a­tion is about: to achieve a beau­ti­ful rec­on­cil­i­a­tion to a seem­ingly in­tractable prob­lem by ad­dress­ing what is truly im­por­tant to the par­ties.”</p>
    <p>Against the back­drop of Covid-19, more are sug­gest­ing me­di­a­tion as a means to set­tle dis­putes.</p>
    <p>Some 79 per cent of par­tic­i­pants polled at a we­bi­nar ti­tled Pre­par­ing For The Storm – Gear­ing Up For Dis­putes After Covid-19 ear­lier this month chose me­di­a­tion as a bet­ter way of re­solv­ing dis­putes com­pared with ar­bi­tra­tion, which seeks to im­pose a rul­ing after hear­ing par­ties rather than find a me­di­ated so­lu­tion mu­tu­ally worked out by the par­ties.</p>
    <p>The 117 par­tic­i­pants who signed into the we­bi­nar in­cluded higher man­age­ment and op­er­a­tions ex­ec­u­tives, as well as in-house coun­sel and prac­tis­ing lawyers, said the Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion (SBF), which part­nered the event with the ICC (In­ter­na­tional Cham­ber of Com­merce) Sin­ga­pore Ar­bi­tra­tion Group.</p>
    <p>OC Queen Street coun­sel Yvette An­thony said: “Me­di­a­tion has en­joyed a re­cent re­nais­sance, par­tic­u­larly fol­low­ing the Covid pan­demic as par­ties seek to re­duce or avoid costs spent on re­solv­ing dis­putes.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, par­ties should note that the strength of their re­spec­tive cases would be a fac­tor as well in me­di­a­tion, she added.</p>
    <p>Premier Law part­ner Navin Joseph Lobo said the firm is notic­ing an in­creased use of multi-tier dis­pute res­o­lu­tion clauses in com­mer­cial con­tracts, which re­quire the par­ties to re­fer their dis­putes to me­di­a­tion be­fore any lit­i­ga­tion or ar­bi­tra­tion pro­ceed­ings can start.</p>
    <p>He said this showed a growing ap­pre­ci­a­tion for the ad­van­tages of me­di­a­tion, such as the preser­va­tion of busi­ness re­la­tion­ships.</p>
    <p>“There is recog­ni­tion that the pan­demic has wide­spread im­pact on par­ties’ abil­i­ties to ful­fil con­trac­tual obli­ga­tions as op­posed to cases of de­lib­er­ate breach where par­ties can be­come en­trenched in their le­gal po­si­tions. This type of dis­pute makes it eas­ier to re­solve by a me­di­ated set­tle­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Chuan said since the Covid-19 pan­demic, SIMC has re­ceived more queries from par­ties in the re­gion and more case fil­ings.</p>
    <p>He added that since SIMC’s launch in Novem­ber 2014 as spe­cial­ists in the me­di­a­tion of cross-bor­der com­mer­cial dis­putes, par­ties from Sin­ga­pore and abroad have filed more than 120 cases with SIMC, with a to­tal dis­pute value of over $4 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Apart from the SIMC, which fo­cuses on in­ter­na­tional dis­putes, there is also the Sin­ga­pore Me­di­a­tion Cen­tre (SMC), which fo­cuses on lo­cal dis­putes.</p>
    <p>SMC has me­di­ated more than 4,500 mat­ters worth over $10 bil­lion since Au­gust 1997, when it was launched.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to its web­site, about 70 per cent of its cases are set­tled, with 90 per cent of them re­solved within a day.</p>
    <p>At the re­cent SBF we­bi­nar, pan­el­list Eu­nice Chua was asked about how an in-house lawyer can con­vince man­age­ment which re­sists me­di­a­tion for com­mer­cial dis­pute res­o­lu­tion, see­ing it as a sign of weak­ness to choose such an op­tion.</p>
    <p>“One sug­ges­tion is to use a risk anal­y­sis or cost ben­e­fit anal­y­sis, point­ing to the 70 per cent to 80 per cent suc­cess rate in me­di­a­tion, weighed against the time, the value of the dis­pute and the cost to be in­curred com­pared to go­ing to ar­bi­tra­tion and to court,” said Ms Chua, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Fi­nan­cial In­dus­try Dis­putes Res­o­lu­tion Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>She added: “Ul­ti­mately, in me­di­a­tion, what you put in is what you get out of it. I think it is good to en­list the help of your me­di­a­tion in­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>“They can of­ten try to fa­cil­i­tate talks that get the me­di­a­tion started, be­fore em­bark­ing on the me­di­a­tion proper.”</p>
