    <p>There is a straight­for­ward nar­ra­tive of the econ­omy this year: The world shut down in the spring be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, caus­ing an eco­nomic col­lapse with­out mod­ern prece­dent. A sharp re­cov­ery be­gan in May as busi­nesses re­opened.</p>
    <p>That is ac­cu­rate as far as it goes. But the snap­back ef­fect over the sum­mer has masked some­thing more wor­ry­ing: We have en­tered a longer, slower grind that puts the econ­omy at risk for the in­def­i­nite fu­ture.</p>
    <p>In the de­tails of govern­ment em­ploy­ment data – cov­er­ing hun­dreds of in­dus­tries – can be seen a jobs cri­sis that pen­e­trates deeply into the econ­omy. Sec­tors that in the­ory should not be much af­fected by the pan­demic at all are show­ing pat­terns akin to a se­vere re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness news head­lines are re­flect­ing a drum­beat of lay­offs nor­mally seen in re­ces­sions. In the last few weeks alone, oil giant Shell said it was cut­ting 9,000 po­si­tions, with Dis­ney elim­i­nat­ing 28,000 and de­fence giant Raytheon, 15,000.</p>
    <p>Af­ter shed­ding jobs in the spring, these sec­tors have brought work­ers back slowly, or not at all, through the sum­mer. Some have con­tin­ued cut­ting po­si­tions. Em­ploy­ment at cor­po­rate head­quar­ters – “the man­age­ment of com­pa­nies and en­ter­prises”, in the of­fi­cial ter­mi­nol­ogy – fell by 92,000 in March and April, with another 4,000 jobs lost since.</p>
    <p>The 3.9 per cent con­trac­tion in these jobs, typ­i­cally white-col­lar pro­fes­sional po­si­tions, is con­sid­er­ably worse than the 2.4 per cent drop dur­ing the 2008 re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>A sim­i­lar pat­tern is ev­i­dent across dozens of in­dus­tries, em­ploy­ing tens of mil­lions of work­ers. These sec­tors did not en­dure a pro­longed pan­demic-in­duced shut­down or col­lapse in busi­ness. But they have shed jobs over the last half-year at rates con­sis­tent with a se­ri­ous down­turn.</p>
    <p>The list is var­ied and in­cludes real es­tate, auto deal­er­ships, ad­ver­tis­ing and heavy con­struc­tion. It even in­cludes lorry trans­porta­tion, a sec­tor that func­tions as the econ­omy’s cir­cu­la­tory sys­tem, given its cru­cial role in en­abling all sorts of com­merce. Over­all, even if you ex­clude the sec­tors di­rectly af­fected by the pan­demic – air trans­porta­tion, arts and en­ter­tain­ment, ho­tels, restau­rants, and both pri­vate and pub­lic ed­u­ca­tion – the num­ber of jobs in Amer­ica was 4.6 per cent lower last month than in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>That is not far from the 5.3 per cent con­trac­tion in to­tal em­ploy­ment that took place dur­ing the en­tire 18 months of what is now known as the Great Re­ces­sion, and around three times worse than the job losses in the 2001 re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>Ex­ec­u­tives in these in­dus­tries and an­a­lysts who study them de­scribe two re­lated phe­nom­ena. One is the me­chan­i­cal ef­fect of shut­downs in large swaths of the econ­omy. But, as is of­ten the case in re­ces­sions, the pan­demic has prompted many firms to ac­cel­er­ate shifts that were al­ready un­der way.</p>
    <p>That im­plies that even as pub­lic health re­stric­tions loosen and as vac­cines get closer, the over­all econ­omy is not poised for a quick snap­back to pre-pan­demic lev­els. Rather, scar­ring is tak­ing place across a much wider range of sec­tors than the sim­ple nar­ra­tive of shut­down ver­sus re­open­ing sug­gests.</p>
    <p>When the econ­omy does get back to full health, many jobs will no longer ex­ist, and Amer­i­can work­ers will need to find other types of work – and, his­tor­i­cally, those kinds of read­just­ments take time.</p>
    <p>“We do ex­pect there to be a new steady state, but not un­til 2023 or 2024,” said Moody’s An­a­lyt­ics economist Sophia Koropeckyj.</p>
    <p>In a new re­port, she es­ti­mates that five mil­lion peo­ple will find it dif­fi­cult to get new work af­ter the pan­demic be­cause their old jobs have dis­ap­peared or changed sig­nif­i­cantly. “I don’t think the sever­ity of this down­turn has been well un­der­stood yet.”</p>
    <p>LOSS OF BUSI­NESS</p>
    <p>The list of things they make at Herron Print­ing & Graph­ics is, more ac­cu­rately these days, the list of things they do not make.</p>
    <p>The com­pany pro­duces the branded tchotchkes and trin­kets that firms give out at trade shows, which are cur­rently not be­ing held. It prints menus for restau­rants that now re­quire cus­tomers to pull up menus on their phones; it makes the logo-bear­ing notepads found on the desks in ho­tel rooms that are closed in­def­i­nitely. Seven months in, busi­ness is still down 90 per cent from pre-pan­demic lev­els, said owner Randy Herron.</p>
    <p>He has cut the staff to three em­ploy­ees from 12 and post­poned pur­chases of equip­ment in­def­i­nitely. He is dip­ping into his sav­ings to keep the busi­ness alive.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple don’t re­alise that if one in­dus­try is hurt­ing, it’s go­ing to hurt sev­eral other in­dus­tries that sup­ply them and leave peo­ple with­out money to spend,” said Mr Herron, who is also pres­i­dent of the Na­tional Print Own­ers As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Sim­ply put, when you take a huge seg­ment of the econ­omy out of com­mis­sion for months on end, the im­pact can­not be con­fined to the work­ers in those in­dus­tries. The sup­pli­ers of ho­tels and restau­rants suf­fer rev­enue col­lapses, and so on in con­cen­tric cir­cles out­ward. Mr Herron, for ex­am­ple, said there was no chance he would be pur­chas­ing new print­ing equip­ment or soft­ware for the fore­see­able fu­ture.</p>
    <p>When the pan­demic hit in the spring, sales of cars and lor­ries col­lapsed. Many auto deal­ers had to close en­tirely be­cause of pub­lic health di­rec­tives, and those that re­mained open saw pal­try traf­fic. The good news for the sec­tor is that over the sum­mer, car and lorry sales surged.</p>
    <p>But, de­spite the re­cov­ery, em­ploy­ment at auto deal­er­ships last</p>
    <p>month was 7 per cent be­low prepan­demic lev­els.</p>
    <p>The rea­son: The pan­demic squeezed years of change into a few months in how cars are sold, making for a less labour-in­ten­sive process that re­quires a smaller sales staff, said Mr Rhett Ri­cart, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Ri­cart Au­to­mo­tive Group in the Colum­bus area in the state of Ohio, which in­cludes Ford and other deal­er­ships.</p>
    <p>For years, car buy­ers have been shift­ing towards do­ing their re­search on­line and com­ing to the deal­er­ship only for a test drive. Pro­longed hag­gling over price has given way to a crisp ne­go­ti­a­tion through e-mails, and cus­tomers can gen­er­ally ap­ply for loans or get es­ti­mates of the value of a trade-in on­line.</p>
    <p>“The pan­demic ac­cel­er­ated ev­ery­thing,” said Mr Ri­cart, who is also chair­man of the Na­tional Au­to­mo­bile Deal­ers As­so­ci­a­tion. “It has been a whole dra­matic change in our to­tal ecosys­tem here, as cus­tomers have been more mo­ti­vated to go on­line.” A few years ago, an av­er­age sales em­ployee would sell 10 cars or lor­ries a month; now those num­bers are mov­ing to 12 or 13.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, these shifts are es­sen­tial if there is to be a dy­namic, grow­ing econ­omy. And, in ev­ery down</p>
    <p>turn, some sec­tors are hit harder than oth­ers. The Great Re­ces­sion started with the col­lapse of a hous­ing bub­ble, and the 2001 down­turn started with the bust of dot.com com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>But what makes a re­ces­sion a re­ces­sion is that the ini­tial eco­nomic pain, what­ever its source, trans­mits broadly to af­fect nearly ev­ery in­dus­try and drive mil­lions of peo­ple not into newer and fast-grow­ing sec­tors but onto the rolls of the un­em­ployed.</p>
    <p>The chal­lenge for eco­nomic pol­i­cy­mak­ers is not to pre­vent these struc­tural ad­just­ments. It is to en­sure that, as pub­lic health con­cerns wane, there is strong enough de­mand for goods and ser­vices across the econ­omy that even as some jobs dis­ap­pear for­ever, new ones are be­ing cre­ated and the pain is short-lived.</p>
    <p>The last two re­ces­sions were fol­lowed by “job­less re­cov­er­ies” in which it took years for that process to play out.</p>
    <p>The ori­gins of the re­ces­sion of 2020 may be dif­fer­ent from those of the pre­vi­ous two down­turns. But, so far, the way it is spread­ing from com­pany to com­pany, and in­dus­try to in­dus­try, looks aw­fully sim­i­lar.</p>
