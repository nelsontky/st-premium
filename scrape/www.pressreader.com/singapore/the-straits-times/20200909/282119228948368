    <p>Lo­cal ship­ping mag­nate Teo Woon Tiong – for­merly the world’s old­est bil­lion­aire – has died at 102. His death comes two years af­ter he stepped down from the board of Pa­cific In­ter­na­tional Lines (PIL) and passed the ba­ton to his son, Mr Teo Siong Seng, bet­ter known as S.S. Teo.</p>
    <p>Just a week af­ter cel­e­brat­ing his 102nd birthday on Aug 27 with his fam­ily and favourite food, durian, Mr Teo died in his sleep on Fri­day. He is sur­vived by eight sons and six daugh­ters.</p>
    <p>“He will al­ways be my boss, my men­tor and my role model,” Mr S.S. Teo told The Straits Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“He was very com­posed and calm, and al­ways told me: ‘When things are go­ing great, don’t get car­ried away. When times are tough, don’t get dis­cour­aged.’ He never lost his tem­per. He was a man of strong prin­ci­ples, be­lieved in hard work and was very thrifty.</p>
    <p>“He cared a lot about his staff. Even dur­ing the pan­demic, he was wor­ried about them, and in­sisted that there be no forced re­dun­dan­cies dur­ing this time of PIL’s re­struc­tur­ing,” said Mr Teo, for­mer chair­man of the Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>PIL, which is the world’s 10thlarges­t con­tainer ship­ping line, is in the process of be­ing res­cued by a con­sor­tium led by Te­masek unit Heli­co­nia Capital Man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>A ship­ping down­turn forced the pri­vately held firm to re­struc­ture its debt. In May, PIL en­tered into a six-month ex­clu­siv­ity agree­ment with Heli­co­nia in re­la­tion to a po­ten­tial in­vest­ment. The Straits Times un­der­stands that a val­u­a­tion ex­er­cise of the PIL Build­ing at 140 Ce­cil Street was con­ducted ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that most of PIL’s se­nior man­age­ment have taken pay cuts. PIL has around 11,000 em­ploy­ees world­wide and about 650 in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The late Mr Teo, bet­ter known as Y.C. Chang, was highly re­garded in the ship­ping in­dus­try, ob­servers say.</p>
    <p>He built one of Sin­ga­pore’s most prom­i­nent ship­ping com­pa­nies, and his death is a loss to Sin­ga­pore’s ship­ping fra­ter­nity, said Mr Moses Lin, a part­ner of Shook Lin & Bok.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Sin­ga­pore Ship­ping As­so­ci­a­tion said of the late Mr Teo: “He was al­ways hum­ble and ap­proach­able. At one point, when there were many Sin­ga­pore­ans who as­pired to go to sea, PIL of­ten pro­vided train­ing berths for sea cadets to gain their ‘sea legs’ and ex­pe­ri­ence on board its many ves­sels.</p>
    <p>“To­day, PIL con­tin­ues to set aside train­ing berths for cadets who grad­u­ate in ship­ping and mar­itime ed­u­ca­tion.”</p>
    <p>The spokesman added: “What many peo­ple may not know is that Mr Teo Woon Tiong started the ship­ping busi­ness and founded PIL when he was 49 years old. This truly un­der­scores the fact that no one is ever too late to start a busi­ness. His per­sonal be­lief to de­liver on his prom­ise won the re­spect of many oth­ers who did busi­ness with him.</p>
    <p>“Mr Teo would al­ways humbly say, ‘only with your sup­port’, when­ever you con­grat­u­lated him. Many of our mem­bers fondly re­mem­ber him as a man who pre­ferred to fo­cus on fam­ily and busi­ness in­stead of seek­ing head­lines and lime­light.”</p>
    <p>The late Mr Teo was widely recog­nised as Sin­ga­pore’s mar­itime ti­tan, a Mar­itime and Port Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore spokesman said. “One of the early pi­o­neers of Sin­ga­pore ship­ping, he was a vi­sion­ary leader and had built PIL from a small ship­ping out­fit to an in­ter­na­tional player.”</p>
    <p>Be­fore start­ing his own ship­ping line in 1967, Mr Teo sailed cargo on Chi­nese junks and once lost his for­tune in a pi­rate at­tack. But he did not lose his drive. He be­gan build­ing the fam­ily’s ship­ping em­pire by buy­ing sec­ond-hand ships and trad­ing them in and out of China and other emerg­ing economies in the 1950s.</p>
    <p>As other firms avoided China at the height of the Cold War, he made his way into the closed market, a move that later paved the way for Sino-Sin­ga­pore bi­lat­eral ties.</p>
    <p>For his con­tri­bu­tions to Sin­ga­pore’s ship­ping in­dus­try, Mr Teo was con­ferred the pres­ti­gious In­ter­na­tional Mar­itime Cen­tre (In­di­vid­ual) award in 2015.</p>
