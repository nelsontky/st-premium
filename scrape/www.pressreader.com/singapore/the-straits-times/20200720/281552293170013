    <p>5 Malaysia and Gold­man Sachs will re­sume talks this week in a fi­nal at­tempt to ham­mer out a fi­nan­cial set­tle­ment over the 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had scan­dal. The re­sump­tion of talks marks a ma­jor break­through in Malaysia’s as­set re­cov­ery cam­paign.</p>
    <p>The Malaysian gov­ern­ment and in­ter­na­tional bank­ing gi­ant Gold­man Sachs will re­sume talks this week in Kuala Lumpur in a fi­nal bid to ham­mer out a multi­bil­lion-dol­lar fi­nan­cial set­tle­ment over the fi­asco at state-owned 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had (1MDB).</p>
    <p>Top US ex­ec­u­tives from Gold­man Sachs and mem­bers of their le­gal team ar­rived last Satur­day – after ob­tain­ing spe­cial Malaysian gov­ern­ment ap­proval due to coro­n­avirus travel curbs – for the talks with the spe­cial task force for the 1MDB re­cov­ery cam­paign led by At­tor­neyGen­eral Idrus Harun.</p>
    <p>“The prospects of get­ting a set­tle­ment are strong after both sides have agreed on key pa­ram­e­ters in re­cent weeks that are needed to move for­ward,” said one Malaysian gov­ern­ment of­fi­cial close to the sit­u­a­tion, with­out elab­o­rat­ing.</p>
    <p>A se­nior US-based fi­nan­cial ex­ec­u­tive, who has been as­sist­ing the Malaysian gov­ern­ment in the pro­tracted ne­go­ti­a­tions with a wide cast of in­ter­na­tional counter par­ties tied di­rectly to the cam­paign to re­coup monies looted from 1MDB, noted that “the GS (Gold­man Sachs) guys would not be mak­ing the long trip to Malaysia if a deal was not within reach”.</p>
    <p>The six-mem­ber GS team will be as­sisted by its Malaysian le­gal rep­re­sen­ta­tive Ku­mar Part­ner­ship, while the Malaysian task force will com­prise Tan Sri Idrus and So­lic­i­tor-Gen­eral II Siti Zainab Omar.</p>
    <p>Datuk Rosli Dahlan and Datuk D.P. Na­ban, the top two se­nior part­ners of Rosli Dahlan Sar­vana Part­ner­ship and also chief le­gal trou­ble-shoot­ers for Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin, have been ap­pointed spe­cial coun­sel to as­sist the task force.</p>
    <p>The re­sump­tion of the talks is a break­through in Malaysia’s 1MDB as­set re­cov­ery cam­paign that has stum­bled since mid-2018 be­cause of mis­steps by the then Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) coali­tion gov­ern­ment that left ne­go­ti­a­tions with Gold­man Sachs, the US Depart­ment of Justice (DOJ) and the gov­ern­ment of Abu Dhabi in vary­ing stages of limbo.</p>
    <p>Talks were also hob­bled due to le­git­i­macy is­sues that have sad­dled the controvers­ial gov­ern­ment that wrested power in March after elected rep­re­sen­ta­tives from Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia and other rene­gade politi­cians aban­doned PH to form a very frag­ile new coali­tion gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The blight on the new Perikatan Na­sional (PN) coali­tion stems from its di­rect ties with the elected rep­re­sen­ta­tives from the long-es­tab­lished Umno and nu­mer­ous other party lead­ers who are bat­tling cor­rup­tion charges in court for al­leged em­bez­zle­ment of 1MDB funds and other graft of­fences run­ning into hun­dreds of mil­lions of dol­lars.</p>
    <p>The pre­vi­ous PH gov­ern­ment had pledged to re­cover more than US$7 bil­lion (S$9.7 bil­lion). But Malaysia has re­ceived only just over US$200 mil­lion from the DOJ and an­other US$150 mil­lion from the sale pro­ceeds of seized as­sets, such as the su­pery­acht Equa­nim­ity.</p>
    <p>Lawyers and fi­nan­cial ex­ec­u­tives close to the sit­u­a­tion said Malaysia’s prospects in the as­set re­cov­ery cam­paign im­proved sig­nif­i­cantly after the Muhyid­din ad­min­is­tra­tion adopted a more prag­matic ap­proach, with the sim­ple aim of se­cur­ing the best deal pos­si­ble in the multi-lay­ered ne­go­ti­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment sources said Fi­nance Min­is­ter Tengku Zafrul Aziz and A-G Idrus ac­tively en­gaged with of­fi­cials from the DOJ and Gold­man Sachs to iron out key bug­bears in the as­set re­cov­ery ne­go­ti­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The turn­ing point came some time in May, when Kuala Lumpur sig­nalled it was pre­pared to par­tic­i­pate in the so-called global set­tle­ment ini­tia­tive led by the DOJ to ham­mer out a solution with the counter-par­ties com­pris­ing fugi­tive fi­nancier Low Taek Jho, Abu Dhabi’s state-owned In­ter­na­tional Petroleum In­vest­ment Com­pany (Ipic) that guar­an­teed the 1MDB bonds amount­ing to US$6.5 bil­lion, and Gold­man Sachs.</p>
    <p>The pre­vi­ous PH gov­ern­ment had de­cided to with­draw from the DOJled ini­tia­tive be­cause it was con­vinced by its lead ne­go­tia­tors that the coun­try could ex­tract much more from Gold­man Sachs and Ipic through le­gal cases in the United King­dom and Malaysia.</p>
    <p>But se­nior le­gal ad­vis­ers to PM Muhyid­din have ar­gued that there was no guar­an­tee the gov­ern­ment would win the le­gal bat­tles.</p>
    <p>The go-alone strat­egy also could leave Malaysia with lit­tle to show be­cause the DOJ was push­ing ahead with ne­go­ti­a­tions to reach a full res­o­lu­tion over the civil for­fei­ture suits and the on­go­ing crim­i­nal in­dict­ments that be­gan in mid-2016.</p>
    <p>“The main con­cern was that should this (the Muhyid­din) gov­ern­ment fall, any agree­ment could be re­neged. With Malaysia in the global set­tle­ment, there is added in­sur­ance for GS,” said the US-based fi­nan­cial ex­ec­u­tive close to the on­go­ing talks.</p>
    <p>The United King­dom, Sin­ga­pore, Hong Kong, Switzer­land and Lux­em­bourg are also part of the DOJ global set­tle­ment, ac­cord­ing to ex­ec­u­tives close to the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
