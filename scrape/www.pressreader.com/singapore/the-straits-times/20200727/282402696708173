    <p>With Sin­ga­pore’s sports com­mu­nity abuzz with news of ath­lete abuse, former women’s artis­tic gymnastics na­tional head coach Ger­rit Belt­man has ad­mit­ted in­volve­ment in un­ac­cept­able be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>In Dutch news­pa­per No­ord­hol­lands Dag­blad’s re­port on Fri­day, the 64-year-old Dutch­man said: “I mis­treated and hu­mil­i­ated young gym­nasts to win medals.</p>
    <p>“I am deeply ashamed. Never have I con­sciously in­tended to hit, to curse, to hurt or to be­lit­tle. But it did hap­pen. I was talked into that, to think it was the only way to cul­ti­vate a top sport men­tal­ity. I blame my­self for fail­ing.”</p>
    <p>It is un­der­stood that th­ese in­ci­dents took place in Bel­gium and the</p>
    <p>Nether­lands. He had been Bel­gium’s na­tional coach from 2002 to 2008 be­fore be­com­ing head coach of the Dutch na­tional ju­nior team.</p>
    <p>On Satur­day, Bel­gian Olympian Aagje Van­wal­leghem took to In­sta­gram to high­light that abuse is “present here in Bel­gium since the start of my top-class ca­reer in 2000 un­til to­day”.</p>
    <p>While she did not men­tion Belt­man in her post, she later spoke to Bel­gian TV chan­nel VTM News.</p>
    <p>“I re­spect his apolo­gies, but I es­pe­cially hope that Ger­rit’s mea culpa shakes up many other coaches,” the vault bronze medal­list at the 2005 Euro­pean Cham­pi­onships said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a re­view from Dutch broad­caster NOS said that Dutch gym­nasts Si­mone Heitinga and Stasja Kohler co-au­thored a book in which they al­leged that he abused them.</p>
    <p>Belt­man told The Straits Times yes­ter­day he had opened up to Dutch me­dia be­cause he wants to be ac­count­able and re­nounce the per­son and coach he once was.</p>
    <p>He hopes to con­trib­ute to the process of change, and to per­suade fed­er­a­tions in the Nether­lands and Bel­gium to look at their sit­u­a­tions as ar­chaic train­ing meth­ods are still present.</p>
    <p>Gym­nasts he groomed also in­clude Dutch Renske En­del, the 2001 world and 2002 Euro­pean sil­ver medal­list on the un­even bars.</p>
    <p>Belt­man joined Sin­ga­pore Gymnastics in Au­gust last year and led the women’s artis­tic gym­nasts at last year’s SEA Games, where they did not win a medal.</p>
    <p>Last month, Belt­man, who was work­ing with Tokyo Olympics­bound Tan Sze En, re­turned to train­ing at Bis­han Sports Cen­tre fol­low­ing the coronaviru­s pan­demic.</p>
    <p>While he was hired with the 2022 Asian Games in mind, ac­cord­ing to a Sin­ga­pore Gymnastics (SG) an­nounce­ment in April last year, he re</p>
    <p>signed to re­turn to the Nether­lands on July 17.</p>
    <p>SG gen­eral man­ager Karen Nor­den told ST that his de­par­ture was a fam­ily-based de­ci­sion and “un­re­lated to the sto­ries of abuse”. She added: “We did not ob­serve any be­hav­iour of what has been pub­lished dur­ing Ger­rit’s ten­ure with SG.”</p>
    <p>She as­serted that her as­so­ci­a­tion has zero tol­er­ance for ath­lete abuse and has ac­tively worked on the process of cre­at­ing a child-safe en­vi­ron­ment, while es­tab­lish­ing feed­back chan­nels to re­port un­savoury in­ci­dents, and that Belt­man’s ap­point­ment fol­lowed due dili­gence.</p>
    <p>She said: “Ger­rit was very open about an is­sue in his past, and equally open on his learn­ings and de­sire to im­prove the cul­ture in the sport.</p>
    <p>“Con­tact was made with ref­er­ees and other peo­ple in the gymnastics com­mu­nity to con­firm that Ger­rit had in­deed learnt and un­der­stood what is ap­pro­pri­ate and in­ap­pro­pri­ate be­hav­iour when coach­ing ath­letes.</p>
    <p>“It was as­sessed that Ger­rit was com­mit­ted to the new norm when it comes to an ath­lete-cen­tric cul­ture for gymnastics and that the health and well-be­ing of the ath­letes comes above any re­sults.”</p>
    <p>Nor­den added that Ger­rit was aware of the “Coaches Code of Be­hav­iour” and the “Safe Sport com­mit­ment state­ment” SG had in place be­fore and dur­ing his em­ploy­ment. While SG said it does not con­done his past be­hav­iour, it be­lieves in re­form and sec­ond chances.</p>
    <p>“We need to judge a man for who</p>
    <p>RE­MORSE</p>
    <p>I am deeply ashamed. Never have I con­sciously in­tended to hit, to curse, to hurt or to be­lit­tle. But it did hap­pen.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
