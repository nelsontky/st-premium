    <p>At 73, as most of his peers are slow­ing down, avid run­ner K. Chan­drasekaran is speed­ing ahead.</p>
    <p>Since he be­gan to run reg­u­larly at 56, he has made great strides, pro­gress­ing from 10km runs to com­plet­ing his first marathon – the Sun­down Marathon – in 2016.</p>
    <p>He has since gone on to par­tic­i­pate in an­other three marathons, plac­ing among the top three Sin­ga­pore­ans in his age cat­e­gory (above 70) in two of them.</p>
    <p>While 2020 has been a rel­a­tively quiet year for him due to the can­cel­la­tion of many tra­di­tional races in the wake of the Covid-19 pan­demic, it is not with­out ac­com­plish­ment.</p>
    <p>He com­pleted the 17.5km and 175km cat­e­gories of The Straits Times Vir­tual Run, fin­ish­ing the longer race yes­ter­day. He cov­ered the dis­tance over 16 ses­sions, be­com­ing the old­est run­ner to fin­ish the 175km race so far. Last year, he clocked 1hr 52min for the 18.45km ST Run.</p>
    <p>The me­chan­i­cal en­gi­neer be­lieves that age should not be an ex­cuse for not ex­er­cis­ing.</p>
    <p>“I never think that I’m old. There are peo­ple who think like that and say they can’t run or walk be­cause of that, but (that way of think­ing) is one’s big­gest en­emy,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It’s all about the de­ter­mi­na­tion. If I say I will run that day, it doesn’t mat­ter whether it rains or not, I’ll do it.”</p>
    <p>Chan­drasekaran tried run­ning at 50 as a way to keep fit, but stopped soon after as he ex­pe­ri­enced chest pains and his knees would swell after each run.</p>
    <p>When he was 56, he em­barked on his sec­ond at­tempt to ex­er­cise reg­u­larly. He tried in­door cy­cling on a sta­tion­ary bike at home after read­ing that it would not add as much pres­sure on the knees as run­ning did, tack­ling short rides of 15 to 20 min­utes be­fore he grad­u­ally in­creased the du­ra­tion of each ses­sion to at least 40 min­utes.</p>
    <p>But he en­coun­tered some is­sues with his sta­tion­ary bi­cy­cle and had to send it for re­pair. That was when he de­cided to give run­ning an­other try.</p>
    <p>He said: “I didn’t want to go on a 10-day break, so I thought I’d try jog­ging, which I’d given up.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing those 10 days, I didn’t feel any dif­fer­ence in my knee con­di­tion, so I de­cided to al­ter­nate be­tween run­ning after that.”</p>
    <p>After do­ing a few 10km events, he tried half-marathons. As he was train­ing to im­prove his half­marathon tim­ing, he be­gan to cover longer dis­tances and even­tu­ally signed up for the Sun­down Marathon in 2016, which he fin­ished in 5hr 56min.</p>
    <p>On what keeps him run­ning, he said: “It’s just some sort of sat­is­fac­tion. It (run­ning a full marathon) just hap­pened, I never planned to do it. It was very ca­sual and I didn’t push my­self.”</p>
