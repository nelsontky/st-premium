    <p>In July 2016, Zul­fikar Mo­hamad Shar­iff was ar­rested and de­tained un­der the In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity Act for ter­ror­ism-re­lated ac­tiv­i­ties and for help­ing to rad­i­calise at least two Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Zul­fikar had been liv­ing in Aus­tralia since 2002, af­ter leav­ing Sin­ga­pore with his fam­ily shortly af­ter var­i­ous run-ins here with Mus­lim lead­ers and the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>From about 2013, he had made nu­mer­ous Face­book posts that pro­moted and glo­ri­fied ter­ror group Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and its vi­o­lent ac­tions like be­head­ings, “while ex­ploit­ing re­li­gion to le­git­imise the ter­ror­ist ac­tiv­i­ties of ISIS”, said the</p>
    <p>Min­istry of Home Af­fairs then.</p>
    <p>His posts con­trib­uted to the rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion of at least two Sin­ga­pore­ans: Muham­mad Shamin Mo­hamed Sidek, who was 29 when he was de­tained in July 2015, and Mr Mo­hamad Said­dhin Ab­dul­lah, who was is­sued with a Re­stric­tion Or­der in July 2016 that lapsed in July this year.</p>
    <p>Zul­fikar’s track record goes back to 2002 when he chal­lenged main­stream Mus­lim lead­ers and ag­i­tated for girls in pri­mary schools to be al­lowed to wear the head­scarf.</p>
    <p>He re­set­tled his fam­ily in Aus­tralia that year. He also joined hard­line or­gan­i­sa­tion Hizbut Tahrir, and es­tab­lished and main­tained con­tact with rad­i­cal preach­ers in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>In 2011, he ap­plied for Aus­tralian cit­i­zen­ship with his then 15-year-old son so that his child could evade his na­tional ser­vice li­a­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Zul­fikar also cul­ti­vated an In­ter­net fol­low­ing by set­ting up an on­line group called Al-Mak­hazin in 2013. He used Face­book to cre­ate nu­mer­ous Al-Mak­hazin plat­forms with the claimed pur­pose of coun­ter­ing West­ern me­dia.</p>
    <p>On Oct 22 this year, he was sen­tenced to six weeks’ jail for flout­ing the Pass­ports Act af­ter falsely declar­ing he had not ob­tained cit­i­zen­ship in an­other coun­try when re­new­ing his Sin­ga­pore pass­port in 2013.</p>
