    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES The Los An­ge­les Clip­pers an­nounced on Tues­day that Tyronn Lue has been pro­moted from as­sis­tant to head coach, re­plac­ing Doc Rivers, who was fired last month.</p>
    <p>“We con­ducted a thor­ough search and spoke with fan­tas­tic can­di­dates. We found that the best choice for our team was al­ready in our build­ing,” said Clip­pers pres­i­dent Lawrence Frank.</p>
    <p>“As head coach, Ty will put a unique im­print on the or­gan­i­sa­tion and drive us to new heights.”</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) side un­veiled the 43-year-old at a news con­fer­ence yes­ter­day. No de­tails of Lue’s con­tract were re­leased but Amer­i­can me­dia re­ported the two sides had agreed on a five-year deal.</p>
    <p>“The pieces we need are in place – com­mit­ted own­er­ship, smart man­age­ment, and elite tal­ent, on and off the court, in the NBA’s best mar­ket,” Lue said in a state­ment. “My fa­mil­iar­ity with the or­gan­i­sa­tion, par­tic­u­larly (team owner Steve Ballmer) and Lawrence, con­firmed this is where I want to be.</p>
    <p>“We have work to do to be­come cham­pi­ons, but we have the mo­ti­va­tion, the tools, and the sup­port to get there. I’m ex­cited to get started.”</p>
    <p>Rivers, who ear­lier this month was ap­pointed the Philadel­phia 76ers head coach, was sacked af­ter the sec­ond seeds in the Western Con­fer­ence squan­dered a 3-1 lead to lose their sec­ond-round play-off se­ries against the Den­ver Nuggets last month.</p>
    <p>The Clip­pers, who have never pro­gressed past the West fi­nals, had been touted as one of the cham­pi­onship favourites af­ter ac­quir­ing last year’s Fi­nals Most Valu­able</p>
    <p>Player Kawhi Leonard and fel­low All-Star Paul Ge­orge, but the team’s chem­istry never looked right un­der Rivers.</p>
    <p>Lue was the head coach of the Cleve­land Cava­liers when they cap­tured the NBA cham­pi­onship with LeBron James in 2016.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he was sacked af­ter a 0-6 start to the 2018-19 sea­son as the Cavs failed to cope with the de­par­ture of James to the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers.</p>
    <p>Mul­ti­ple me­dia out­lets re­ported last week that for­mer Detroit Pis­tons star Chauncey Billups would serve as Lue’s as­sis­tant, but the Clip­pers were yet to con­firm the ap­point­ment.</p>
    <p>In the East, In­di­ana Pac­ers also named a new head coach on Tues­day in the wake of the sack­ing of Nate McMil­lan in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>A Pac­ers state­ment said Toronto</p>
    <p>Rap­tors as­sis­tant coach Nate Bjork­gren, who helped the Cana­dian team win their first cham­pi­onship last year, had been hired af­ter an “ex­ten­sive and thor­ough” search.</p>
    <p>Their pres­i­dent of bas­ket­ball op­er­a­tions Kevin Pritchard added of the new man: “He comes from a win­ning back­ground, has ex­pe­ri­enced cham­pi­onship suc­cess, is in­no­va­tive and his com­mu­ni­ca­tion skills along with his pos­i­tiv­ity are tremen­dous.”</p>
    <p>The ap­point­ment marks Bjork­gren’s first head coach role in the NBA. He said: “This is some­thing I have pre­pared for dur­ing my ca­reer. I’m look­ing for­ward to work­ing with this great team to achieve our goal as NBA cham­pi­ons.”</p>
    <p>In­di­ana suf­fered a first-round sweep by fi­nal­ists Mi­ami Heat in Au­gust.</p>
