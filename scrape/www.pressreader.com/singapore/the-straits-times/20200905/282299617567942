    <p>Sin­ga­pore is set to re­ceive a lo­cal boost from a high-tech farm in sa­ti­at­ing its ap­petite for prawns.</p>
    <p>The ver­ti­cal farm, which ex­pects its first har­vest by March next year, will fo­cus on rear­ing the pop­u­lar van­namei prawns, also known as pa­cific white shrimp, king prawn and “bai xia”.</p>
    <p>These trop­i­cal prawns are grey is hwhite and sweet, with a firm tex­ture.</p>
    <p>Univer­sal Aqua­cul­ture will be housed in a 1,300 sq m ware­house in Tuas South Link. Work on the fa­cil­ity, which will com­prise 33 sets of a unique tank clus­ter, be­gins next month.</p>
    <p>Each clus­ter has a pair of three rec­tan­gu­lar tanks stacked atop one an­other, with a pipe run­ning be­tween the tanks.</p>
    <p>One tank at the base of the clus­ter will be a wa­ter treat­ment tank, while the other five will house the prawns, with about 1,400 in each tank.</p>
    <p>Each clus­ter will then be stacked, cre­at­ing a ma­trix of tanks in the sin­gle-storey fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>“Each clus­ter runs in­de­pen­dently, and we don’t share wa­ter be­tween them to pre­vent cross-con­tam­i­na­tion. If one set has is­sues, the oth­ers will not be af­fected,” said Univer­sal Aqua­cul­ture chief ex­ec­u­tive Jeremy Ong.</p>
    <p>Each tank in a clus­ter can house other prawn species and fishes such as tilapia and sea bass, based on the de­mand for them, he added.</p>
    <p>The first ware­house can pro­duce about 44 tonnes of prawns an­nu­ally, and the com­pany plans to lease more ware­houses to yield 400 tonnes by 2022, which would make it one of the big­gest pro­duc­ers here.</p>
    <p>Last year, Sin­ga­pore im­ported more than 35,000 tonnes of seafood, ex­clud­ing fish. The amount pro­duced lo­cally was 628 tonnes. Prawns and shrimps are mainly from Malaysia.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic has set a tar­get of pro­duc­ing 30 per cent of its nu­tri­tional needs lo­cally by 2030 to bol­ster food se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Univer­sal Aqua­cul­ture plans to start sell­ing its prawns by March next year. Un­til then, it will en­gage in test mar­ket­ing to build up a pool of buy­ers, Mr Ong said, adding that there is a strong mar­ket for good qual­ity seafood here.</p>
    <p>He and his team of six aqua­cul­ture ex­perts spent six years do­ing re­search and de­vel­op­ment (R&D) to per­fect the farm­ing process.</p>
    <p>They have suc­cess­fully tested their tech­nolo­gies in a smaller proof-of-con­cept farm in Kal­lang.</p>
    <p>One of the out­stand­ing R&D out­comes is a pro­pri­etary en­ergy-sav­ing wa­ter treat­ment sys­tem, which uses both me­chan­i­cal and bi­o­log­i­cal fil­tra­tion to main­tain high wa­ter qual­ity so the prawns can thrive.</p>
    <p>“This means that chang­ing wa­ter in the tanks is not nec­es­sary, and the only wa­ter loss is through evap­o­ra­tion,” said Mr Ong.</p>
    <p>To en­sure the high qual­ity of prawns and to avoid over­seas sup­ply dis­rup­tion, a hatch­ery and nurs­ery will also be set up. The team be­lieves it will be the first com­mer­cial van­namei prawn hatch­ery in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The farm also has plans to ex­pand over­seas in three to five years, as the tech­nolo­gies and ver­ti­cal farm struc­tures are eas­ily scal­able.</p>
    <p>Premium seafood sup­plier Oceanus Group, the com­pany’s in­vestor, will be sup­port­ing its ex­pan­sion plans.</p>
    <p>Said Oceanus group chief ex­ec­u­tive and direc­tor Peter Koh: “We talked with of­fi­cials from China last week and they were pretty keen to bring the sys­tem there. We are also talk­ing to of­fi­cials in the Mid­dle East.”</p>
    <p>The sys­tem will “al­low us to bring fresh seafood to places where they are less ac­ces­si­ble”, he added.</p>
