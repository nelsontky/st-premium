    <p>Ac­tress Hailee Ste­in­feld stars in the Ap­ple TV+ se­ries Dick­in­son (2019 to present), a mil­len­nial com­edy drama that just hap­pens to be set in 19th-cen­tury New Eng­land.</p>
    <p>And it nods to mod­ern celebrity cul­ture and in­flu­encers to land some of its punches this sea­son.</p>
    <p>Its hero­ine is based on a real his­tor­i­cal fig­ure, Emily Dick­in­son, the re­bel­lious young Amer­i­can poet who lived in iso­la­tion and ob­scu­rity most of her life, her bril­liance recog­nised only posthu­mously.</p>
    <p>But the po­etry and let­ters she left be­hind hint at a rich in­ner life and an in­tense love for her sis­ter-in­law, Sue (Ella Hunt).</p>
    <p>The show uses them as a spring­board to imag­ine a se­cret ro­mance be­tween the two, along with Emily’s mus­ings and strug­gles.</p>
    <p>Sea­son 2, which pre­mieres to­mor­row, sees Sue be­com­ing a prom­i­nent so­cialite who hosts sa­lons and par­ties for the rich and fa­mous.</p>
    <p>And Emily is con­fronted with the fact that, with the ad­vent of news­pa­pers and the tele­graph, writ­ers and artists now have to play the fame game if they want to find an au­di­ence– much like to­day.</p>
    <p>There are many other par­al­lels with con­tem­po­rary celebrity cul­ture, says Ste­in­feld, who starred in the hit Pitch Per­fect mu­si­cal come­dies (2015 to 2017).</p>
    <p>“There are as many pos­i­tive as (there are) neg­a­tive fac­tors. In Dick­in­son, Emily sees the ben­e­fits of fame – peo­ple read­ing her work and ap­pre­ci­at­ing it,” the ac­tress tells the me­dia in a Zoom call from Los An­ge­les.</p>
    <p>“It’s some­thing peo­ple think they want, then they get it and recog­nise it’s not ev­ery­thing they wanted. Fame is such a weird thing in that way, it’s very de­ceiv­ing.</p>
    <p>“And what’s fun about Sea­son 2 is that it ex­plores all the cor­ners of fame – what it re­ally means and do you re­ally want it,” says the 24-year-old, who has been in the spotlight since she was 14, when she won an Os­car nom­i­na­tion for the western True Grit (2010).</p>
    <p>The show’s cre­ator, Alena Smith, says her goal “is to use the mid-19th cen­tury, in par­tic­u­lar the pe­riod lead­ing up to and in­clud­ing the Amer­i­can Civil War, as a metaphor for what we’re liv­ing through to­day”.</p>
    <p>“That metaphor op­er­ates in a lot of dif­fer­ent ways. It talks about is­sues to do with gen­der and sex­u­al­ity and race,” says the writer­pro­ducer, who worked on the drama The Af­fair (2015 to 2017).</p>
    <p>And in Sea­son 2, Emily ex­pe­ri­ences “a kind of speed­ing up of the me­dia land­scape – new tech­nolo­gies like the tele­gram and tele­graph have led to a sat­u­ra­tion in news, which is a lot like what we see to­day”.</p>
    <p>The sto­ry­lines this sea­son may also call to mind so­cial me­dia in­flu­encers such as Kim Kar­dashian – and that is be­cause “our con­tem­po­rary ideas of celebrity were ac­tu­ally be­ing formed in the mid-19th cen­tury”, Smith notes.</p>
    <p>“With the new tech­nolo­gies, peo­ple were able to be­come fans and track their favourite stars and know about what they’re do­ing.”</p>
    <p>The ques­tions faced by Emily are the same ones so­cial me­dia users face to­day, the writer adds.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause now ev­ery per­son on earth has the tools to put them­selves in the pub­lic eye, we can broad­cast our lives via so­cial me­dia and ev­ery­one has been told to build his or her per­sonal brand.</p>
    <p>“And it’s be­come a press­ing ques­tion for ev­ery­one – what parts of my­self am I go­ing to show and what parts am I go­ing to keep to my­self?” says Smith.</p>
    <p>For Ste­in­feld, the real Dick­in­son has be­come a hugely in­spi­ra­tional fig­ure. She is most in­spired by “her level of fear­less­ness – how brave she was in a time when she was for­bid­den to do what made her feel alive, which was writ­ing”.</p>
    <p>“But she did what­ever she could. She wrote on any ar­ti­cle of pa­per she could find, and she chose to sit in her room and iso­late her­self from the world be­cause that’s where she could be the most cre­ative.”</p>
    <p>And some­thing about the choice to self-iso­late res­onates with the ac­tress. “Liv­ing in this world where, for al­most a year, we’ve been forced to be in iso­la­tion, when you look at a per­son in real life who chose that – be­cause that’s where she felt the most free – is crazy. We’re now liv­ing this Emily Dick­in­son life­style, but it’s not as though we’re choos­ing it. So to see what she did is so amaz­ing.”</p>
    <p>Emily sees the ben­e­fits of fame – peo­ple read­ing her work and ap­pre­ci­at­ing it. It’s some­thing peo­ple think they want, then they get it and recog­nise it’s not ev­ery­thing they wanted. Fame is such a weird thing in that way, it’s very de­ceiv­ing.</p>
