    <p>Armed pirates stormed three ships in the Sin­ga­pore Strait in the span of 21/ hours be­tween Sun­day night</p>
    <p>2 and yes­ter­day morn­ing. The lat­est armed rob­beries bring the tally for this month to six, the high­est monthly fig­ure this year.</p>
    <p>Armed pirates stormed three ships in the Sin­ga­pore Strait in the span of 21/ hours be­tween Sun­day night</p>
    <p>2 and yes­ter­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>But noth­ing was stolen from the bulk car­ri­ers in the three sep­a­rate in­ci­dents, which took place in close prox­im­ity to one an­other in the east­bound lane of the Traf­fic Sep­a­ra­tion Scheme (TSS) in the wa­ter­way.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther were their crew in­jured, the Re­gional Co­op­er­a­tion Agree­ment on Com­bat­ing Piracy and Armed Rob­bery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP) In­for­ma­tion Shar­ing Cen­tre said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The lat­est armed in­ci­dents bring the tally for this month to six, the high­est monthly fig­ure this year.</p>
    <p>Al­to­gether, 28 such in­ci­dents in the Sin­ga­pore Strait have been re­ported so far this year, against 31 for the whole of last year.</p>
    <p>Of this year’s cases, 24 oc­curred in the east­bound lane of the TSS.</p>
    <p>The 105km-long Sin­ga­pore Strait is sig­nif­i­cant as it pro­vides pas­sage for thou­sands of ships en­ter­ing and leav­ing the port of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In all of this month’s at­tacks, there was no con­fronta­tion be­tween the per­pe­tra­tors and the crew.</p>
    <p>Noth­ing was stolen ex­cept in one in­ci­dent, where a lifebuoy and some weld­ing rods were taken.</p>
    <p>In the lat­est three cases, the first took place at about 11.09pm on Sun­day, when bulk car­rier Sea­jour­ney was trav­el­ling near Nongsa Point in Batam, In­done­sia, on the way to Ci­wadan, also in In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>The ship mas­ter re­ported to the Ves­sel Traf­fic In­for­ma­tion Sys­tem (VTIS) that an unau­tho­rised per­pe­tra­tor had been spot­ted near the en­gine room en­trance.</p>
    <p>The ReCAAP In­for­ma­tion Shar­ing Cen­tre (ISC) said: “The alarm was raised and the mas­ter car­ried out a search on board the ship, but with no sight­ing of the per­pe­tra­tor. The crew was safe, and noth­ing was stolen.”</p>
    <p>The Re­pub­lic of Sin­ga­pore Navy’s Mar­itime Se­cu­rity Task Force (MSTF) and the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Coast Guard were no­ti­fied, along with the In­done­sian au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>A safety nav­i­ga­tional broad­cast was also made.</p>
    <p>About two hours later, at 12.46am yes­ter­day, an­other bulk car­rier, A Racer, was trav­el­ling north of Pu­lau Nongsa, In­done­sia, on its way to China, when it was alerted by VTIS to an un­known craft along­side it.</p>
    <p>The ship mas­ter re­ported that five unau­tho­rised per­sons had been seen on board. The alarm was raised and a search car­ried out.</p>
    <p>There was no sight­ing of the per­pe­tra­tors, noth­ing was lost and the crew were un­harmed.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore navy’s MSTF, the Po­lice Coast Guard and the In­done­sian au­thor­i­ties were no­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>Less than an hour later, at 1.30am, an­other bulk car­rier, El Mata­dor, was near Nongsa Point in Batam, when it was alerted to an un­known craft along­side it.</p>
    <p>The ship mas­ter spot­ted three in­trud­ers in the en­gine room, raised the alarm and four per­pe­tra­tors were seen flee­ing the ves­sel.</p>
    <p>As he was un­sure if all the in­trud­ers had left the ship, the ship mas­ter di­verted the ves­sel to the an­chor­age in Batam, where the In­done­sian navy boarded and searched the ship.</p>
    <p>There were no more per­pe­tra­tors on board, the crew was safe and noth­ing stolen, so the ship re­sumed its voy­age.</p>
    <p>“The ReCAAP ISC is con­cerned with the in­crease of in­ci­dents in the Sin­ga­pore Strait. As the per­pe­tra­tors of these in­ci­dents have not been ar­rested, there is a pos­si­bil­ity of fur­ther in­ci­dents in the Sin­ga­pore Strait,” the or­gan­i­sa­tion said.</p>
    <p>“All ships are ad­vised to ex­er­cise ut­most vig­i­lance, adopt ex­tra pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures and re­port all in­ci­dents im­me­di­ately to the near­est coastal state.”</p>
    <p>The ReCAAP ISC also urged the lit­toral states to in­crease pa­trols and en­force­ment in their re­spec­tive wa­ters, and fur­ther co­or­di­nate and share in­for­ma­tion about in­ci­dents and crim­i­nal groups in­volved.</p>
