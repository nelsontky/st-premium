    <p>Dai Xiangyu, who was in the 2008 drama, plays the same role of pho­tog­ra­pher Ya­mamoto Yousuke in the 2020 Chi­nese re­make</p>
    <p>Re­mem­ber the fresh-faced ac­tor who played the charm­ing Ja­panese lover of Jeanette Aw in the 2008 hit lo­cal drama The Lit­tle Nyonya?</p>
    <p>Chi­nese ac­tor Dai Xiangyu, pre­vi­ously known as Dai Yang­tian, is now play­ing the same role in the 2020 Chi­nese re­make of the Sin­ga­porean drama.</p>
    <p>In an e-mail in­ter­view, the 35-year-old ac­tor tells The Straits Times in Man­darin that the re­make is a sec­ond chance for him as he has al­ways thought he was too young for the char­ac­ter of Ya­mamoto Yousuke, a pho­tog­ra­pher, 12 years ago.</p>
    <p>“Lit­tle Nyonya was the be­gin­ning of my dreams and my foray into this in­dus­try. To be able to film it again, I have no re­grets now,” he says.</p>
    <p>The Lit­tle Nyonya, which is avail­able on stream­ing plat­form iQiyi, has been well re­ceived in China – land­ing at the top of Weibo’s re­al­time search rank­ings chart. It is a no­table feat con­sid­er­ing that the se­ries pre­miered with no prior pro­mo­tion.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to me­dia anal­y­sis firm DataWin, which takes into ac­count fac­tors such as view­er­ship num­bers and In­ter­net clicks, The Lit­tle Nyonya was con­sid­ered the “most pop­u­lar” tele­vi­sion se­ries in China on the night of its fi­nale, which aired on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>On pop­u­lar video stream­ing app Douyin, the show was also the No. 1 trend­ing search term on the same night.</p>
    <p>Dai, who kicked off his act­ing ca­reer in Sin­ga­pore with Me­di­a­corp and left the broad­caster in 2013 to ex­plore op­por­tu­ni­ties in his home coun­try, is not sur­prised that a Sin­ga­porean story can do well is China. He says: “I think au­di­ences can feel the emo­tions we are try­ing to con­vey.”</p>
    <p>Com­par­ing the two ver­sions, he says of his lead­ing ladies, Aw and rookie Chi­nese ac­tress Xiao Yan: “Jeanette was a bit older than Xiao when she acted in the se­ries so her char­ac­ter showed more life ex­pe­ri­ence, whereas Xiao is more in­no­cent and cute in her por­trayal.”</p>
    <p>Like Aw, Xiao, who has never watched the 2008 se­ries, plays the dual pro­tag­o­nists of Jux­i­ang and Yue­ni­ang, who are mother and daugh­ter. She re­calls feel­ing an im­me­di­ate affin­ity with both char­ac­ters when she tried on the tra­di­tional sarong ke­baya.</p>
    <p>“I usu­ally wear ca­sual ath­leisure clothes, but when I wore the ke­baya, I felt the de­mure, soft side of me as a woman,” says the 23-year-old.</p>
    <p>She en­joyed the cui­sine while film­ing in Malaysia, but faced chal­lenges like the hot trop­i­cal weather and the di­rec­tor’s com­mit­ment to au­then­tic­ity.</p>
    <p>“There was one scene where Jux­i­ang dives into the sea to save her young daugh­ter Yue­ni­ang and I didn’t want to use a stand-in, so I dived in my­self. The sea, oddly, was not cold but had a strong stench of dead fish,” she re­calls.</p>
    <p>“When we came out, both the child ac­tress and I felt some­thing bite us and saw lit­tle white worms on our legs. I al­most cried then, but held it in be­cause I was play­ing a mother and I wanted to be strong for my child.”</p>
    <p>Work­ing with Me­di­a­corp ac­tors like Xiang Yun and Jef­frey Xu, who also star in the se­ries, Xiao says: “The cast and crew from Sin­ga­pore were very po­lite and pro­fes­sional. They never com­plained and were al­ways full of en­ergy. They were the first to say hello and make you feel com­fort­able dur­ing film­ing.”</p>
    <p>As for Dai, Xiao says: “He talked to me about film­ing the se­ries in the past, his un­der­stand­ing of our char­ac­ters and their love story.”</p>
    <p>De­spite play­ing the same char­ac­ter 12 years apart, ne­ti­zens have pointed out that Dai hardly looks a day older.</p>
    <p>But he is all grown up in real life. He re­veals that he and his wife, Chi­nese ac­tress Chen Zi­han, whom he mar­ried in 2016, are try­ing to have a child. “We hope we can wel­come a new mem­ber to our fam­ily soon,” he says.</p>
    <p>Will the ac­tor, who also re­cently starred in the hit Chi­nese se­ries Eter­nal Love Of Dream, ever re­turn to work in Sin­ga­pore?</p>
    <p>He says: “I’ve had in­vi­ta­tions in the past two years, but sadly our sched­ules could not align. I am in talks with pro­duc­tions in Sin­ga­pore and I do miss my fans and au­di­ences there.”</p>
