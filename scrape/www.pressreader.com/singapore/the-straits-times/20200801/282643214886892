    <p>With the facelifted Audi A4, you get good news and bad news.</p>
    <p>First, the bad news. The car costs more than its pre­de­ces­sor. The 2-litre 190hp ver­sion tested here has a list price of $190,490 – nearly $16,000 more than its 2018 equiv­a­lent (af­ter tak­ing into ac­count higher cer­tifi­cate of en­ti­tle­ment prices back then).</p>
    <p>The price jump is partly at­trib­uted to the new car’s 12-volt “mild hy­brid” sys­tem, which is said to save up to 0.3 litres of fuel per 100km by al­low­ing, among other things, oc­ca­sional en­gine-off coast­ing.</p>
    <p>Yet, the new car has a rated con­sump­tion of 6.3 litres/100km, ver­sus its pre­de­ces­sor’s 5.2 litres/100km.</p>
    <p>Now, the good news. The test car av­er­aged 7.8 litres/100km, com­pared with the nearly 10 litres/100km that the pre­vi­ous A4 man­aged. This is de­spite the new car be­ing 50kg heav­ier and wear­ing big­ger wheels with higher speed-rated tyres.</p>
    <p>The sprint­ing per­for­mance of the 190hp A4 re­mains un­changed at 7.3 sec­onds, but its top speed is now 241kmh in­stead of the pre­vi­ously lim­ited 210kmh.</p>
    <p>The driv­e­train re­mains the same, with a 1,984cc turbo B-cy­cle en­gine send­ing 320Nm of torque to the front wheels via a seven-speed dual-clutch gear­box. Trans­mis­sion ra­tios are also un­changed.</p>
    <p>At the wheel, the A4 feels lively enough, even if you de­tect a hint of turbo lag when­ever you are in a hurry.</p>
    <p>Around bends, the com­pact feels like a much big­ger car – a sen­sa­tion un­mit­i­gated by its feath­ery steer­ing. Switch­ing to Dy­namic mode for­ti­fies the steer­ing, but does not tame the car’s sashay­ing.</p>
    <p>Driven leisurely, the car has the feel of a li­mou­sine, with an en­gine noise so low you can hear the rolling tyres and the ef­fort­less­ness of its steer­ing now an ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>The test car is fit­ted with adap­tive cruise con­trol, ac­tive lane-keep­ing and blind-spot warn­ing.</p>
    <p>Of the three fea­tures, adap­tive cruise con­trol is the most use­ful. This ver­sion is rather im­pres­sive, with the abil­ity to fol­low the ve­hi­cle in front within one car length. It is also more re­spon­sive to chang­ing traf­fic con­di­tions than many oth­ers. But the fea­ture – tied to lane­keep­ing and blind-spot warn­ing – is a cost op­tion.</p>
    <p>The facelifted A4 comes with a host of other stan­dard-is­sue fea­tures, though.</p>
    <p>The most prom­i­nent one is an ul­tra-thin 10.1-inch in­fo­tain­ment touch­screen. Not only is this 44 per cent big­ger than the pre­vi­ous screen, but it also has more func­tions and boasts hard­ware which is said to be 10 times faster than the pre­vi­ous one. The facelifted A4 is also the first model to use this hard­ware.</p>
    <p>The en­hanced func­tion­al­ity makes the pre­vi­ous multi-me­dia in­ter­face pad re­dun­dant, free­ing up space for a stor­age bin in the cen­tre con­sole.</p>
    <p>Else­where, the car’s 12.3-inch in­stru­men­ta­tion panel has new graph­ics and more con­fig­u­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>Changes that most Audi fans will no­tice, how­ever, are on the out­side – new head­lamps and tail-lights, flared rear shoul­der line, more prom­i­nent char­ac­ter lines and new sill cov­ers.</p>
    <p>Big­ger and bolder air in­take hous­ings are chrome-lined like the ra­di­a­tor grille they flank. In the rear, a stylish dif­fuser as­sem­bly houses trape­zoidal tailpipes which re­place plain round ones.</p>
    <p>All these make the A4 look ap­pre­cia­bly sportier. That alone might be worth its pre­mium price.</p>
