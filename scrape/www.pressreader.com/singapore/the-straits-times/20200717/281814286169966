    <p>In­dia and China have di­alled down ten­sions as their forces dis­en­gage along dif­fer­ent points of the Line of Ac­tual Con­trol (LAC) in the Ladakh re­gion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the process has been more com­plex in some ar­eas than oth­ers and talks are con­tin­u­ing.</p>
    <p>But the fall­out from the violent clash be­tween the two sides in the re­gion on June 15, which left 20 In­dian sol­diers dead, con­tin­ues to re­ver­ber­ate in In­dia with grow­ing doubts about eco­nomic en­gage­ment with China.</p>
    <p>Though an im­me­di­ate boy­cott is seen to be im­prac­ti­cal, ex­perts say In­dia should re­duce its de­pen­dence on Chi­nese im­ports and push do­mes­tic man­u­fac­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>“I think it’s clear, not just from the</p>
    <p>In­dian ex­pe­ri­ence but the world over, that it’s not a good idea to re­main locked into one coun­try. Par­tic­u­larly if it’s a coun­try with which you are go­ing to have fre­quent bor­der skir­mishes. I don’t think the bor­der con­flict is be­hind us,” said pro­fes­sor of eco­nom­ics at Jawa­har­lal Nehru Univer­sity Biswajit Dhar.</p>
    <p>“I think it is im­por­tant for In­dia ir­re­spec­tive of what hap­pened on the bor­der to re­ally fo­cus on de­cou­pling from China. You need to strengthen our man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor, kick-start the econ­omy and cre­ate jobs. What is hap­pen­ing is that by de­pend­ing on China, we are ex­port­ing jobs,” he added.</p>
    <p>China was In­dia’s largest trad­ing part­ner last year with trade reach­ing US$92.68 bil­lion (S$129 bil­lion), mostly in favour of China. In­dia ex­ports gems and jew­ellery, agri­cul­tural prod­ucts and petro­chem­i­cals, while Chi­nese im­ports in­clude elec­tron­ics, phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal in­gre­di­ents and toys.</p>
    <p>The two coun­tries suc­cess­fully delinked bor­der dis­putes from their eco­nomic re­la­tion­ship three decades ago but the lat­est clash has hit trade ties like never be­fore.</p>
    <p>In­dia has banned 59 Chi­nese apps, in­clud­ing TikTok, on grounds of na­tional se­cu­rity and an­nounced that Chi­nese com­pa­nies would not be al­lowed in high­way projects. Chi­nese im­ports have been stuck for longer pe­ri­ods at ports and air­ports across the South Asian coun­try.</p>
    <p>Many In­dian ex­perts ac­knowl­edge that de­cou­pling will not be easy or likely to be fast, con­sid­er­ing how cheap Chi­nese goods and in­vest­ments have pen­e­trated the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“You can’t do it fast. It’s a slow process. You have to give a sig­nal to in­dus­try (on re­duc­ing im­ports from China). Gov­ern­ment pro­cure­ment has to be do­mes­tic, which is the only way to en­cour­age do­mes­tic in­ter­ests,” said Pro­fes­sor San­jib Po­hit at the Na­tional Coun­cil of Ap­plied Eco­nomic Re­search.</p>
    <p>I think it is im­por­tant for In­dia ir­re­spec­tive of what hap­pened on the bor­der to re­ally fo­cus on de­cou­pling from China. You need to strengthen our man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor, kick-start the econ­omy and cre­ate jobs. What is hap­pen­ing is that by de­pend­ing on China, we are ex­port­ing jobs.</p>
    <p>Boost­ing lo­cal man­u­fac­tur­ing has been an un­suc­cess­ful goal for suc­ces­sive In­dian gov­ern­ments. In his first term, Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi rolled out a “Make in In­dia” ini­tia­tive. But man­u­fac­tur­ing re­mains hemmed in by a range of is­sues from lo­gis­ti­cal prob­lems and trou­ble­some land ac­qui­si­tions to high in­ter­est rates.</p>
    <p>“Ac­cel­er­ated move to de­cou­ple in the short term might re­sult in sup­ply dis­rup­tions and higher in­put costs, in the midst of evolv­ing do­mes­tic man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pac­i­ties,” said Ms Rad­hika Rao, an econ­o­mist at DBS Group Re­search in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“Tak­ing a long-term view to cor­rect trade im­bal­ances and pro­mote the re­cent shift to­wards in­di­geni­sa­tion, In­dia is likely to fo­cus ef­forts to lower re­liance on man­u­fac­tur­ing im­ports and vie to build ca­pac­ity do­mes­ti­cally.”</p>
    <p>Amid the eco­nomic re­think, the disen­gage­ment process has been mov­ing at a slow pace.</p>
    <p>Colonel Aman Anand, spokesman for the In­dian Army, has said it is “in­tri­cate and re­quires con­stant ver­i­fi­ca­tion”.</p>
    <p>Na­tion­al­ist sen­ti­ment, i n the mean­time, has not abated in In­dia.</p>
    <p>The Delhi Ho­tels & Restau­rant Own­ers As­so­ci­a­tion, a group of around 1,300 Delhi ho­tels and restau­rants, has said it would con­tinue with a ban on pro­vid­ing ho­tel and guest­house rooms to Chi­nese na­tion­als.</p>
    <p>“We will not give rooms to Chi­nese na­tion­als. The disen­gage­ment process is not com­plete yet. If ten­sions rise, we will next ban use of Chi­nese prod­ucts in our ho­tels,” said its pres­i­dent San­deep Khan­del­wal, who noted that so far no in­stance had sur­faced of Chi­nese na­tion­als be­ing turned away.</p>
