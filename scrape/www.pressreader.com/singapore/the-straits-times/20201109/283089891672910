    <p>Atyp­i­cal white-col­lar worker’s day is fairly rou­tine, with most work­ing in com­fort­able air-con­di­tioned of­fices where safety pre­cau­tions in­volve safe dis­tanc­ing, tem­per­a­ture tak­ing and Safe En­try check-ins and check-outs for con­tact-trac­ing pur­poses.</p>
    <p>But things are very dif­fer­ent at work­places sur­rounded by oil, gas, petro­chem­i­cals and heavy ma­chin­ery; there, an av­er­age day in­volves stand­ing at great heights or within scorch­ing tem­per­a­tures, lift­ing heavy ob­jects or be­ing in arm’s reach of toxic chem­i­cals or flammable liq­uids that could cause a ma­jor ex­plo­sion.</p>
    <p>At such “of­fices”, work safety takes on a whole new def­i­ni­tion. What kind of health and safety reg­u­la­tions are re­quired? Here’s how work­ers at three or­gan­i­sa­tions go about their day.</p>
    <p>Staff at one of the re­gion’s lead­ing oil and gas in­fra­struc­ture ser­vices com­pa­nies, Ro­tary Engi­neer­ing, are of­ten in an en­vi­ron­ment where heavy in­dus­trial ma­te­ri­als are trans­ported. And so, pre­fab­ri­cated com­po­nents are utilised and a holis­tic safety plan is adopted to re­duce work­ers’ ex­po­sure to in­ci­dent risks.</p>
    <p>“Tanks and struc­tures are as­sem­bled in work­shops rather than on-site, re­sult­ing in a huge re­duc­tion of in­jury risk. This stream­lined ap­proach also pro­vides an ef­fi­cient at­mos­phere for pro­duc­tiv­ity,” says its cor­po­rate health, safety and en­vi­ron­ment man­ager Lakshmanan A. Kannu.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, Ro­tary’s To­tal Work­place Safety and Health ethos en­sures an in­te­grated ap­proach to man­age in­ter­ac­tions be­tween work, safety and health. “For in­stance, Ro­tary adopts an au­to­mated launch­ing mech­a­nism to lift, move and in­stall heavy ma­te­ri­als dur­ing con­struc­tion, re­duc­ing the need for em­ploy­ees to work at heights and min­imis­ing their ex­po­sure to the dan­gers of heavy lift­ing,” explains Mr Lakshmanan.</p>

    <p>Ac­count­abil­ity and author­ity</p>
    <p>Mean­while, with most of Petro­chem­i­cal Cor­po­ra­tion of Sin­ga­pore’s (PCS) work tak­ing place in ar­eas clas­si­fied as Ma­jor Haz­ard In­stal­la­tions — fixed in­stal­la­tions, in­clud­ing petroleum fa­cil­i­ties where large quan­ti­ties of toxic and flammable sub­stances are stored and/or used — stay­ing vig­i­lant and ac­count­able is vi­tal to avoid ac­ci­dents stem­ming from fires or toxic leaks. That’s why PCS be­lieves that worker em­pow­er­ment is</p>
    <p>es­sen­tial to main­tain safety stan­dards. “Ev­ery­one in the work­force is em­pow­ered with the author­ity to re­port any un­safe act or con­di­tion, in­clud­ing stop­ping on­go­ing un­safe ac­tiv­ity,” says its health, safety and en­vi­ron­ment man­ager Bernard Leong.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, work­ers are also up­dated on the lat­est poli­cies and pro­grammes, and given ad­e­quate train­ing to re­main com­pe­tent and fa­mil­iar with var­i­ous feed­back mech­a­nisms such as post-train­ing as­sess­ment and eval­u­a­tion sur­veys as part of the com­pany’s Train­ing Needs Anal­y­sis frame­work.</p>
    <p>Ground-break­ing in­no­va­tion</p>
    <p>And as for JEL Main­te­nance — a sub­sidiary of Jurong Engi­neer­ing Lim­ited which pro­vides main­te­nance and project ser­vices to var­i­ous re­finer­ies and plants — it car­ries out chal­leng­ing tasks as part of ev­ery­day op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, re­plac­ing a seal on a flare stack would mean work­ing at a height of 150m with lim­ited work­ing space.</p>
    <p>To pro­vide safer train­ing for such a task, vir­tual re­al­ity (VR) sim­u­la­tions cre­ate an im­mer­sive en­vi­ron­ment where work­ers can spend more time fa­mil­iaris­ing them­selves with the process safely on the ground, per­form­ing risk as­sess­ments in ad­vance to im­prove ef­fi­ciency and safety.</p>
    <p>Adds its project man­ager San­deep Jain: “The use of VR makes it easy to cre­ate im­mer­sive work­site con­di­tions while train­ing work­ers in a safe en­vi­ron­ment com­pared to the tra­di­tional way. Fur­ther­more, vi­su­al­is­ing the work­site in VR mode im­proves com­mu­ni­ca­tion and co­or­di­na­tion among the work­ers as they plan their tasks more ef­fi­ciently.”</p>
