    <p>•</p>
    <p>Thai­land’s Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha, fac­ing pres­sure amid ex­pand­ing protests call­ing for his ouster, told re­porters yes­ter­day that “no one wants to stage a coup”.</p>
    <p>Asked about ru­mours and sug­ges­tions by some pro­test­ers of a pos­si­ble coup to re­place him, he said the ques­tion should be put to those mak­ing the com­ments, not to him.</p>
    <p>“We never think about this. We need to be care­ful and pre­vent the sit­u­a­tion from es­ca­lat­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal un­cer­tain­ties have risen in Thai­land since wide­spread antigov­ern­ment protests be­gan in the South-east Asian na­tion ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>Ris­ing dis­con­tent against the Premier is seen as one of the main fac­tors feed­ing the demon­stra­tions but Mr Prayut has made it clear that he does not in­tend to re­sign.</p>
    <p>The for­mer army chief has run Thai­land for over six years, hav­ing taken power him­self in a 2014 coup and re­turn­ing as Premier af­ter elec­tions last year un­der a Con­sti­tu­tion pro­duced by his mil­i­tary regime.</p>
    <p>A re­vi­sion of that Con­sti­tu­tion and re­forms to the na­tion’s monar­chy are the main de­mands of the pro­test­ers.</p>
    <p>A likely coup would give the army sweep­ing pow­ers to crack down on the cur­rent protests.</p>
    <p>“I don’t mean whether or not there will be a coup, but that no one wants to do it,” Mr Prayut said, af­ter a meet­ing at the De­fence Min­istry.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, the army also de­nied ru­mours of a likely coup.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, some stu­dents sym­pa­thetic to Thai pro­test­ers yes­ter­day said they were boy­cotting grad­u­a­tion cer­e­monies led by King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn, in a show of anger at the monar­chy amid grow­ing calls to re­form it.</p>
    <p>The cer­e­monies, at which the monarch per­son­ally hands out de­grees, are a rite of pas­sage for grad­u­ates and their fam­i­lies with pho­to­graphs of the mo­ment dis­played with pride in many Thai homes.</p>
    <p>But protests since mid-July have brought about open crit­i­cism of the monar­chy and calls to curb its power, de­fy­ing a long­stand­ing taboo and lese ma­jeste laws that set a jail term of up to 15 years for crit­i­cism of the King or his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Mr Sup­panat Kingkaew, 23, said he was boy­cotting the cer­e­monies be­ing held yes­ter­day and to­day at Tham­masat Univer­sity, long viewed as a hotbed of rad­i­cal­ism and scene of a mas­sacre of prodemoc­racy pro­test­ers by roy­al­ist state forces in 1976.</p>
    <p>“What­ever it takes so that the hall is left with the small­est num­ber of peo­ple,” Mr Sup­panat told Reuters. “This is to send an in­di­rect mes­sage that some of us are un­happy with the monar­chy and we want change.”</p>
    <p>It was un­clear how many Tham­masat stu­dents would fol­low the boy­cott.</p>
    <p>Among those at­tend­ing are Mr Pa­pangkorn Asava­panichakul, 24, who said: “I want the pho­to­graph. It’s a once-in-a-life­time event.”</p>
