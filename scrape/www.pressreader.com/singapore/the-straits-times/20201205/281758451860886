    <p>Ja­pan is fac­ing a dire med­i­cal cri­sis as the num­ber of pa­tients with se­vere Covid-19 symp­toms tripled in one month to hit a new high of 505 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The death toll is also mount­ing rapidly, with a new one-day record of 45 deaths yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ris­ing in tan­dem with the wors­en­ing sit­u­a­tion is anger with the re­sponse of Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga’s gov­ern­ment to the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Pre­fec­ture lead­ers ac­cused the na­tional gov­ern­ment of sim­ply pass­ing the buck to them.</p>
    <p>Osaka Gov­er­nor Hiro­fumi Yoshimura, who de­clared a “red alert” in his pre­fec­ture on Thurs­day, be­moaned how Par­lia­ment did not con­sider laws for Covid-19 in the light of the med­i­cal cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors also slammed the seem­ing lack of ur­gency, cit­ing the stop­gap mea­sures mooted by politi­cians, in­clud­ing the trans­fer of non-in­fec­tious dis­ease spe­cial­ists to help in the Covid-19 fight.</p>
    <p>In a widely shared Face­book post, Dr Hideaki Oka of t he Saitama Med­i­cal Cen­tre in the city of Kawa­goe, north of Tokyo, com­pared the sit­u­a­tion to flight op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>He wrote: “The cur­rent po­lit­i­cal de­ci­sions are akin to say­ing that ev­ery­thing is fine be­cause there are still planes left, even if they are be­ing flown by mo­bilised in­ex­pe­ri­enced pi­lots. Is this re­ally safe?”</p>
    <p>This comes as hospi­tal beds are in short sup­ply, and doc­tors and nurses are be­ing over­worked to the point of ex­haus­tion.</p>
    <p>In Osaka, doc­tors and nurses are be­ing trans­ferred to the Osaka City Juso Hospi­tal, which has been des­ig­nated for Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>About 25 hospi­tal em­ploy­ees have quit since the start of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Osaka City Gen­eral Hospi­tal has had to shut its can­cer ward for pa­tients aged 15 to 39 be­cause there were not enough nurses to tend to them.</p>
    <p>The Kobe City Med­i­cal Cen­tre Gen­eral Hospi­tal has down­sized its in­ten­sive care units, while the Sap­poro City Gen­eral Hospi­tal is not tak­ing in any new pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Hospi­tal clus­ters have also been emerg­ing, in­clud­ing one in the city of Asahikawa in Hokkaido with at least 214 Covid-19 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Med­i­cal ex­perts warn that hos­pi­tals in hard-hit ar­eas are at a tip­ping point.</p>
    <p>Ex­pec­tant moth­ers and pa­tients suf­fer­ing from other con­di­tions are be­ing turned away amid the dire short­age of med­i­cal staff.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga, how­ever, in­sists that the gov­ern­ment is re­spond­ing “with the strong­est sense of cri­sis”.</p>
    <p>At a news con­fer­ence yes­ter­day to mark the end of the Diet ses­sion, he pledged to “se­cure a suf­fi­cient re­serve fund to be able to re­spond to what­ever hap­pens”.</p>
    <p>The Cab­i­net will com­pile its third emer­gency stim­u­lus next week to pro­vide fur­ther sup­port to ail­ing busi­nesses and med­i­cal in­sti­tu­tions. Part of the stim­u­lus will also go to a five-month ex­ten­sion of the Go To Travel do­mes­tic tourism cam­paign to June.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan logged at least 2,442 new cases yes­ter­day, ac­cord­ing to a tally by pub­lic broad­caster NHK.</p>
    <p>That brought the to­tal num­ber of cases in the coun­try to 158,411. A to­tal of 2,306 peo­ple have died.</p>
    <p>The cap­i­tal added 449 new cases and the Tokyo Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion chair­man Haruo Ozaki urged the gov­ern­ment to take stronger mea­sures rather than adopt hap­haz­ard, in­co­her­ent poli­cies.</p>
