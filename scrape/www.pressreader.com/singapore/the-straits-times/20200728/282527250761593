    <p>FLY­ING BACK TO SIN­GA­PORE: Tai­wanese singer Vi­vian Hsu has not seen her Sin­ga­pore-based, In­done­sia-born busi­ness­man hus­band Sean Lee, who is two years younger than her, for months as a re­sult of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But Hsu, who had flown to Tai­wan for film­ing in Fe­bru­ary, is fi­nally re­unit­ing with him in Sin­ga­pore. The cou­ple have a son Dal­ton, who turns five next month.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary this year, Hsu, 45, flew to Tai­wan with Dal­ton to film the mys­tery se­ries Who’s By Your</p>
    <p>Side, which is di­rected by ac­tor-direc­tor Peter Ho and also stars Kaiser Chuang and Ja­nine Chang.</p>
    <p>She also re­leased a new sin­gle, Yours Al­ways, in mem­ory of her late father.</p>
    <p>Her stay in Tai­wan co­in­cided with the pan­demic, and she and Mr Lee could not fly reg­u­larly to meet each other.</p>
    <p>Hsu missed her hus­band so much that she asked him to send her two T-shirts he wears fre­quently so she could feel that he is be­side her.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Hsu is re­unit­ing with her hus­band. On Sun­day, she posted on so­cial me­dia three pho­tos of her and Dal­ton in pro­tec­tive gear, as she wrote in Chi­nese: “We are fly­ing. I will miss all of you. Although I will not be in Taipei in Au­gust, my new song will stay be­hind and keep ev­ery­one com­pany.</p>
    <p>“We will be quar­an­tined for 14 days af­ter we reach Sin­ga­pore. Don’t worry as we will take good care of our­selves. Wish­ing ev­ery­one and our­selves safety.”</p>
