    <p>Cash has long been king, but for an in­creas­ing num­ber of peo­ple like re­tiree Brid­get Khoo, the fear of in­fec­tion from han­dling notes and coins is push­ing them into the some­times daunt­ing world of dig­i­tal pay­ments.</p>
    <p>Madam Khoo, 63, was keen to make the dig­i­tal leap but was wary at first. She said: “I’m wor­ried that us­ing (e-pay­ment) apps like PayLah! may be trou­ble­some, or I may key in the wrong dig­its and end up pay­ing the wrong amount.”</p>
    <p>But she re­alised her fears were un­founded af­ter some guid­ance from a dig­i­tal am­bas­sador at Teck Ghee Com­mu­nity Club yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A makeshift “min­i­mart” has been set up at the club with small items such as toi­let rolls and hand sani­tiser on of­fer.</p>
    <p>It al­lowed Madam Khoo, who used to work in man­u­fac­tur­ing, to prac­tise how to scan a QR code and then pay for items us­ing the DBS PayLah! app.</p>
    <p>It turned out to be a breeze. “It wasn’t dif­fi­cult at all, and the am­bas­sador was very help­ful,” she said.</p>
    <p>Se­niors who find it con­fus­ing or in­tim­i­dat­ing to use e-pay­ment meth­ods such as apps or QR codes can now get more sup­port through</p>
