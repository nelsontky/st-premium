    <p>An Ac­tiveSG gym in Bukit Ba­tok, a Sheng Siong store in Te­ban Gar­dens Road and FairPrice Hub’s De­cathlon out­let were added by the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day to its list of places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were still in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions and times that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes to get those who were at these places at spe­cific pe­ri­ods to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>The full list of lo­ca­tions and times can be found on MOH’s web­site.</p>
    <p>The min­istry has said that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and that there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned, if needed.</p>
    <p>There were 301 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed by MOH yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 54,555.</p>
    <p>They in­cluded four com­mu­nity cases com­pris­ing two Sin­ga­pore­ans, one per­ma­nent res­i­dent and a work per­mit holder.</p>
    <p>Of the four com­mu­nity cases, two were picked up as a re­sult of the min­istry’s proac­tive sur­veil­lance and screen­ing.</p>
    <p>Two of these cases are asymp­to­matic and were de­tected through MOH’s proac­tive test­ing.</p>
    <p>One of the com­mu­nity cases is linked to a pre­vi­ous case, while the re­main­ing three are cur­rently un­linked.</p>
    <p>Epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions for the un­linked cases are i n progress.</p>
    <p>There were also four new im­ported cases com­pris­ing one Sin­ga­porean, two work pass hold­ers and one de­pen­dant’s pass holder.</p>
    <p>They had been placed on stay­home no­tices upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore from Kaza­khstan and In­dia on July 25, and were tested while serv­ing their no­tices.</p>
    <p>The four im­ported pa­tients, aged be­tween 19 and 49, were con­firmed to be pos­i­tive on Wed­nes­day and yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the 293 re­main­ing cases.</p>
    <p>No new clus­ters were an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>MOH also said the in­ter-agency task force set up to sup­port for­eign work­ers and dor­mi­tory op­er­a­tors has been sys­tem­at­i­cally and pro­gres­sively clear­ing dor­mi­to­ries through ag­gres­sive test­ing of mi­grant work­ers re­sid­ing in dorms.</p>
    <p>Four­teen more of these dorms – which in­clude the ones at 5 Kaki Bukit In­dus­trial Ter­race, 10 Kranji Link and 119 Tuas View Walk 1 – have been cleared.</p>
    <p>These dorms now house only re­cov­ered in­di­vid­u­als and those who have re­cently tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19 in­fec­tion. As a re­sult, the coro­n­avirus clus­ters linked to them have now been closed.</p>
    <p>MOH added that the av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from three cases two weeks ago to two in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of one case per day in the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>With 263 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 48,016 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the disease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 112 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal while 6,385 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. None are in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
