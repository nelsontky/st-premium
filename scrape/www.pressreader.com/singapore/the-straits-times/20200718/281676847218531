    <p>There has been a resur­gence in the num­ber of Covid-19 cases in coun­tries such as Ja­pan and Aus­tralia be­cause safe man­age­ment mea­sures have not been ad­hered to. This in­cludes peo­ple join­ing large gath­er­ings or not wear­ing masks.</p>
    <p>Pre­sent­ing a chart show­ing the rise in cases in var­i­ous coun­tries at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong said: “We have found that some had gone out when they were un­well and min­gled in set­tings where many peo­ple had con­gre­gated. These in­clude re­li­gious events, par­ties and large fam­ily gath­er­ings.”</p>
    <p>In South Korea, for ex­am­ple, door-to-door sales re­sulted in four clus­ters with over 200 cases, while re­li­gious gath­er­ings there re­sulted in more than 110 cases.</p>
    <p>In the Aus­tralian state of Vic­to­ria, large school clus­ters formed as stu­dents did not prac­tise so­cial dis­tanc­ing and par­tic­i­pated in so­cial gath­er­ings out­side.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan also said that in Tokyo, more than 300 cases have been linked to nightlife es­tab­lish­ments, while out­breaks have been recorded at res­tau­rants in Hong Kong as pa­trons did not put their masks back on af­ter their meals.</p>
    <p>These in­ci­dents pro­vide “use­ful lessons” that Sin­ga­pore can glean to avoid a sim­i­lar sce­nario hap­pen­ing here, he said.</p>
    <p>“From these ex­am­ples, we know that there are set­tings and ac­tiv­i­ties that are more sus­cep­ti­ble to trans­mis­sion, where there is close and pro­longed con­tact among in­di­vid­u­als,” he added, not­ing that these in­clude work­places, re­li­gious gath­er­ings and nightlife es­tab­lish­ments.</p>
    <p>This is why the task force has taken a “cau­tious ap­proach” in eas­ing re­stric­tions for ac­tiv­i­ties that are known to be of higher risk. Night­clubs, for ex­am­ple, are still not al­lowed to re­open here.</p>
    <p>As for places that need to func­tion, such as work­places, mea­sures have been put in place to re­duce the risk of in­fec­tion spread in these set­tings, he said.</p>
    <p>Where pos­si­ble, work­ers are ad­vised to work from home. If work­ers must go to the work­place, such as to ac­cess spe­cialised equip­ment, they must ob­serve a safe dis­tance from their col­leagues, and also wear masks.</p>
    <p>“Some of these mea­sures cre­ate in­con­ve­nience, but it is bet­ter to be safe,” said Mr Gan.</p>
    <p>“We are cer­tainly, cer­tainly not out of the woods yet. Glob­ally, there are now more than 13 mil­lion re­ported Covid-19 cases and more than 500,000 deaths as­so­ci­ated with Covid-19,” he warned.</p>
