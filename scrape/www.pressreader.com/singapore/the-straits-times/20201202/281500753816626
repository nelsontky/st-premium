    <p>A top pro­fes­sor from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) was dis­missed yes­ter­day for sex­ual mis­con­duct.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Theodore G. Hopf, who was the provost chair pro­fes­sor at the depart­ment of po­lit­i­cal science at the Fac­ulty of Arts and So­cial Sciences, had sex­u­ally ha­rassed a stu­dent “in phys­i­cal, ver­bal and writ­ten forms”, NUS said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>It is the se­cond time in two months that NUS has had to sack a fac­ulty mem­ber over al­le­ga­tions of sex­ual mis­con­duct in­volv­ing stu­dents. There was also a third in­ci­dent in­volv­ing an­other pro­fes­sor and a staff mem­ber re­cently.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber, NUS fired for­mer Tem­busu Col­lege fel­low Jeremy Fer­nando over al­le­ga­tions of sex­ual mis­con­duct.</p>
    <p>Two stu­dents al­leged he had made non-con­sen­sual ad­vances to­wards them, and Dr Fer­nando was sacked af­ter in­ter­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions found he had an in­ti­mate as­so­ci­a­tion with an un­der­grad­u­ate.</p>
    <p>Last month, NUS said the for­mer di­rec­tor of its East Asian In­sti­tute, Pro­fes­sor Zheng Yong­nian, had be­haved in­ap­pro­pri­ately with a sub­or­di­nate. He would have been dis­ci­plined had he not left the univer­sity in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, in the state­ment list­ing the se­quence of events and sum­mary of key find­ings in Prof Hopf’s case, NUS said it re­ceived an anony­mous com­plaint against him in Au­gust and in­ves­ti­ga­tions be­gan im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>Af­ter in­ter­views with the stu­dent and Prof Hopf, a no-con­tact or­der was is­sued to the pro­fes­sor on Sept 15, pro­hibit­ing him from con­tact­ing any NUS stu­dent.</p>
    <p>The 61-year-old Amer­i­can, bet­ter known as Ted Hopf, was sus­pended and told to stay off cam­pus while in­ves­ti­ga­tions were on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>On Oct 21, a Com­mit­tee of In­quiry (COI), ap­pointed on Oct 7, in­ter­viewed the stu­dent, who was ac­com­pa­nied by a care of­fi­cer from the NUS Vic­tim Care Unit.</p>
    <p>As Prof Hopf needed to seek treat­ment for a se­ri­ous med­i­cal con­di­tion, the COI in­ter­viewed him on Nov 13 af­ter his med­i­cal leave, NUS said.</p>
    <p>The COI sub­mit­ted its in­quiry re­port to the univer­sity on Nov 18.</p>
    <p>NUS made a po­lice re­port last Fri­day, af­ter in­form­ing the stu­dent that it would do so in line with its le­gal obli­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>“Given the se­ri­ous na­ture of the of­fences, NUS dis­missed Prof Hopf on Dec 1,” said the univer­sity. It de­clined to re­veal any in­for­ma­tion on the stu­dent, in­clud­ing the gen­der.</p>
    <p>NUS said that dur­ing Prof Hopf’s meet­ing with the stu­dent on cam­pus in Au­gust, he al­legedly of­fered and drank al­co­hol with the stu­dent, and also made an of­fen­sive re­mark about cer­tain parts of the stu­dent’s anatomy. He ad­mit­ted to the COI he had made the re­mark.</p>
    <p>The COI found that the con­sump­tion of al­co­hol at the work­place and the act of mak­ing an of­fen­sive re­mark went against the code of con­duct for staff re­lat­ing to ex­pec­ta­tions of pro­fes­sional be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>Prof Hopf also al­legedly pulled the stu­dent force­fully to­wards him twice, dur­ing which the stu­dent re­sisted, moved back and told the pro­fes­sor to stop.</p>
    <p>Prof Hopf ad­mit­ted plac­ing his hands on the stu­dent’s shoul­ders while fac­ing the stu­dent, but de­nied pulling the stu­dent to­wards him.</p>
    <p>The COI “found the stu­dent’s ac­count of the un­wel­come phys­i­cal con­tact to be cred­i­ble” and that the acts went against the code of con­duct for staff.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber 2018, Prof Hopf had also sent a sex-text mes­sage to the stu­dent. He ad­mit­ted to sending the mes­sage but ex­plained to the COI that it was meant for some­one else.</p>
    <p>As he did not clearly in­form the stu­dent that the mes­sage was for some­one else and did not apol­o­gise for sending it by mis­take, the COI es­tab­lished that this was a se­ri­ous pro­fes­sional mis­con­duct.</p>
    <p>“Prof Hopf had failed to act with pro­pri­ety, re­spect and deco­rum... The COI also found that Prof Hopf, who was in a po­si­tion of author­ity, had sex­u­ally ha­rassed the stu­dent in phys­i­cal, ver­bal and writ­ten forms. The COI con­cluded that his con­duct was a se­ri­ous breach of the NUS staff code of con­duct,” NUS said.</p>
    <p>“There are strict guide­lines per­tain­ing to per­sonal and pro­fes­sional con­duct. In par­tic­u­lar, the univer­sity has zero tol­er­ance for sex­ual mis­con­duct by staff.”</p>
    <p>The Straits Times has con­tacted Prof Hopf for a com­ment.</p>
    <p>He pre­vi­ously served on the fac­ul­ties of Ohio State Univer­sity, Ohio Univer­sity and Univer­sity of Michi­gan, and sat on the boards of sev­eral in­sti­tu­tions, in­clud­ing NUS’ Asia Re­search In­sti­tute’s man­age­ment board.</p>
    <p>SE­RI­OUS BREACH</p>
    <p>Prof Hopf had failed to act with pro­pri­ety, re­spect, and deco­rum... The COI (Com­mit­tee of In­quiry) con­cluded that his con­duct was a se­ri­ous breach of the NUS staff code of con­duct.</p>
