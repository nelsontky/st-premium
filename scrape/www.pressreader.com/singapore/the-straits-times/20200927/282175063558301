    <p>Manch­ester United had won. Not a game, let alone a tro­phy, but they had won the In­ter­net. Or the foot­balling part of it, any­way. They had signed Alexis Sanchez, filmed him pre­tend­ing to play the pi­ano to a sound­track of Glory, Glory Man United, and posted it on Twit­ter and In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>“The an­nounce­ment posts gen­er­ated 75 per cent more in­ter­ac­tions than the an­nounce­ment of the sale of the world’s most ex­pen­sive player, when Ney­mar moved from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Ger­main,” re­ported ex­ec­u­tive vice-chair­man Ed Wood­ward.</p>
    <p>Congratula­tions, then. But while United grav­i­tated to the lime­light, Tot­ten­ham showed there was another way of do­ing things. Six­teen months later, they reached the Cham­pi­ons League fi­nal with a wage bill of £179 mil­lion (S$314 mil­lion), some £143 mil­lion lower than United’s. They were a by­word for over­achieve­ment, United for ex­pen­sive un­der­achieve­ment; Sanchez, a hideously bad buy, per­son­i­fied it.</p>
    <p>Fast for­ward a fur­ther 16 months and Spurs seem to have un­der­gone a per­son­al­ity trans­plant. They have joined foot­ball’s celebrity cul­ture as United did af­ter Alex Fer­gu­son re­tired. They can be found in ranks of the at­ten­tion-seek­ers, in a global con­test for head­lines. Three moves, while none nec­es­sar­ily a fail­ure yet, high­light a rad­i­cal shift in ap­proach.</p>
    <p>There was the hir­ing of Jose Mour­inho, per­haps the world’s most fa­mous and quotable man­ager, but one whose best days are be­hind him. There was the All Or Noth­ing Ama­zon doc­u­men­tary.</p>
    <p>And, most re­cently, there was Gareth Bale’s re­turn.</p>
    <p>His signing gen­er­ated huge op­ti­mism and re­flected a U-turn in think­ing. Bale, at his turbo-charged peak, was a phe­nom­e­non at White Hart Lane. His is a nos­tal­gic come­back, but also one with the po­ten­tial to prove trans­for­ma­tive, and not merely be­cause Lu­cas Moura has gone 22 league games with­out a goal.</p>
    <p>Bale should cer­tainly be a far bet­ter signing than Sanchez was for United, even if goalscor­ing wingers po­ten­tially en­ter­ing phys­i­cal de­cline have cer­tain sim­i­lar­i­ties. Mour­inho was man­ager when both were re­cruited, though not the driv­ing force for ei­ther deal.</p>
    <p>Yet it is hard to imag­ine Tot­ten­ham ac­quir­ing Bale a year ago. Mauri­cio Po­chet­tino stood for or­ganic im­prove­ment, and not merely be­cause chair­man Daniel Levy was then so averse to spend­ing he went 18 months with­out signing any­one.</p>
    <p>Apart from Fer­nando Llorente, Po­chet­tino barely bought a player in the sec­ond half of his ca­reer. They were all on an up­ward curve, able to be coached and moulded. Mour­inho fa­mously prefers ex­pe­ri­ence to po­ten­tial.</p>
    <p>Spurs now seem to en­joy the ex­cite­ment of a big name, much as United savoured signing the rich and fa­mous. But they come with a com­men­su­rate cost: even with Real Madrid sub­si­dis­ing Bale’s salary, he will still be Tot­ten­ham’s best-paid player. Per­haps he will cat­a­pult them back into the Cham­pi­ons League or maybe, in United’s style, they will pay more to achieve less.</p>
    <p>Levy, a fa­mously tough ne­go­tia­tor and a penny-pinch­ing prag­ma­tist, feels starstruck by Mour­inho, Bale and Ama­zon. Yet, while Spurs lost their way in Po­chet­tino’s fi­nal few months, his regime was built on sound foot­balling and fi­nan­cial prin­ci­ples. Now Spurs threaten to go from foot­ball club to soap opera, to be­come the op­po­sites of their for­mer selves.</p>
    <p>Spurs seem to have un­der­gone a per­son­al­ity trans­plant. They have joined foot­ball’s celebrity cul­ture as United did af­ter Alex Fer­gu­son re­tired. They can be found in ranks of the at­ten­tion-seek­ers, in a global con­test for head­lines.</p>
