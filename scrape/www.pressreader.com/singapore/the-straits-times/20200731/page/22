        WORLD A22 THE STRAITS TIMES FRIDAY, JULY 31, 2020 | | | Three spacecraft heading to Mars Three spacecraft are setting out on a journey of millions of kilometres.
Bound for Mars, they carry an array of state-of-the-art instrument­s to explore the red planet. PERSEVERAN­CE UNITED STATES (launched yesterday) Mast Power supply Contains a laser that will study the chemistry of Martian rocks. INGENUITY HELICOPTER The nearly 1 tonne rover carries 19 cameras and a drill to extract core samples from rocks. It has aluminium wheels and a suspension system to drive over obstacles. The 1.8kg experiment­al Mars helicopter will be the first to attempt powered flight on another planet. Will identify chemical elements to seek signs of past life on Mars. WATSON Drill Will identify molecules and minerals to detect potential biosignatu­res, with help from the Watson camera. Four carbon-fibre blades will spin at about 2,400rpm A turret with many instrument­s is attached to the 2.1m arm. Inside Jezero Crater MARS LANDING IN JEZERO CRATER The National Aeronautic­s and Space Administra­tion’s Perseveran­ce rover will attempt to land in Jezero
Crater, an ancient Martian lake roughly the size of Lake Tahoe. If successful, the rover will spend years exporing the river delta and making its way to the crater rim. 1 2 3 4 5 6 Jezero Crater Possible path of rover Target landing area Canyon carved by a river Shoreline River delta Crater rim Finally, the sky crane will fly away, leaving the rover stationary on the ground. A heat shield will protect the rover as the spacecraft enters the Martian atmosphere. After the spacecraft enters the atmosphere, a parachute will deploy to slow the descent. Next, the heat shield will separate from the bottom of the landing pod. The back shell will separate to release the sky crane. The sky crane, powered by retrorocke­ts, will lower the rover slowly to the ground.
