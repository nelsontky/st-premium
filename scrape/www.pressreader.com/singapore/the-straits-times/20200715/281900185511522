    <p>SHANG­HAI • Sol­diers have erected sand­bag flood bar­ri­ers in a city near China’s largest fresh­wa­ter lake af­ter the heav­i­est rain­fall in nearly six decades drenched the swollen Yangtze River basin.</p>
    <p>The vast Yangtze drainage area has been lashed by tor­ren­tial rains since last month, leav­ing 141 peo­ple dead or miss­ing and forc­ing the evac­u­a­tion of mil­lions more across sev­eral prov­inces.</p>
    <p>Flood­ing along the river – the world’s third long­est – has been an an­nual sum­mer scourge since an­cient times, but this year’s in­un­da­tion has been es­pe­cially se­vere.</p>
    <p>The down­pours have in­ten­si­fied since last week, caus­ing dozens of wa­ter­ways in the Yangtze River basin to regis­ter record-high wa­ter lev­els, while more than 400 had al­ready ex­ceeded warn­ing lev­els, said Vice-Min­is­ter of Emer­gency Man­age­ment Zheng Guoguang on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“Since June, av­er­age pre­cip­i­ta­tion in the Yangtze River basin has been the high­est since 1961,” he told a news brief­ing in Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>More rain than nor­mal is ex­pected in some north­ern ar­eas as the re­gion pre­pares to en­ter its rainy sea­son, usu­ally from late July to early Au­gust, said Mr Ye Jianchun, Vice-Min­is­ter of Wa­ter Re­sources. Ma­jor floods may oc­cur in the river basins of the Songhua, Liaohe, Haihe and Huaihe and the mid­dle reaches of the Yel­low River.</p>
    <p>“There has been no flood­ing in these river basins for years. Peo­ple are not very knowl­edge­able about flood con­trol there, and lo­cal flood con­trol ca­pa­bil­i­ties are com­par­a­tively weak,” Mr Ye said.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties had been mon­i­tor­ing a flood crest as it neared Wuhan, the me­trop­o­lis of 11 mil­lion that the Yangtze winds through and which had al­ready suf­fered a vast num­ber of China’s deaths and cases in the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, which first emerged in the city.</p>
    <p>They said river lev­els were de­creas­ing af­ter the crest passed Wuhan on Mon­day, with no re­ports of ma­jor new flood­ing there.</p>
    <p>Con­cern was now shift­ing down­stream to Poyang Lake, which drains into the Yangtze in hard-hit Jiangxi province and is the largest fresh­wa­ter lake fully within China’s bor­ders.</p>
    <p>State-run Xin­hua news agency said wa­ter lev­els at a key hy­dro­log­i­cal sta­tion on the lake broke a record set in 1998, when more than 4,000 peo­ple were killed in China’s worst flood­ing in re­cent decades.</p>
    <p>State me­dia re­ported that more than 100,000 peo­ple – in­clud­ing res­cue per­son­nel, sol­diers and or­di­nary cit­i­zens – had been de­ployed to help with flood-con­trol ef­forts in Jiangxi province.</p>
    <p>Around half of those were sent to Poyang Lake, where many dikes and lev­ees had col­lapsed, state tele­vi­sion re­ported.</p>
    <p>In the city of Ji­u­jiang, near where the lake drains into the Yangtze, sol­diers wear­ing orange life vests for­ti­fied the river bank with a wall of sand­bags piled as high as a man.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, sev­eral thou­sand peo­ple have re­turned to Jiangzhou to save their home­town from be­ing flooded af­ter the lo­cal flood con­trol au­thor­ity said in a let­ter that it was se­verely short-handed and needed young peo­ple to come home to help bat­tle the swelling Yangtze River.</p>
    <p>Jiangzhou is on an is­land sur­rounded by the Yangtze. It has only about 7,000 in­hab­i­tants, and many of them are older peo­ple. Fewer than 1,000 peo­ple are able to carry out flood con­trol ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The Yangtze’s length is ex­ceeded only by the Nile and the Ama­zon rivers, and its drainage basin is home to around 400 mil­lion peo­ple. Sum­mer rains and sea­sonal glacial melt in the river’s Ti­betan plateau head­wa­ters cause rou­tine an­nual flood­ing.</p>
    <p>But en­vi­ron­men­tal­ists say the threat has wors­ened over t he decades due in part to ram­pant con­struc­tion of dams and lev­ees that have cut con­nec­tions be­tween the river and ad­ja­cent lakes and flood­plains that for cen­turies had helped ab­sorb the sum­mer surge.</p>
    <p>Con­ser­va­tion­ists have also warned that the rapid melt­ing of glaciers in the Hi­malayas due to cli­mate change may lead to more dan­ger­ous sum­mer flood­ing.</p>
