    <p>A re­cent sur­vey com­mis­sioned by The Straits Times of 1,000 peo­ple aged 16 and above here found that about eight in 10 would say yes to get­ting a Covid-19 vac­cine, with more than half of this group will­ing to get it as soon as it is avail­able.</p>
    <p>The rest in this group would rather get a Covid-19 jab af­ter one is avail­able for six to 12 months, a sen­ti­ment that ap­pears to be shared by some well-known fig­ures here.</p>
    <p>This week, the United King­dom be­gan giv­ing health­care work­ers and el­derly peo­ple the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine, be­com­ing the first coun­try in the world to au­tho­rise this vac­cine for emer­gency use. China and Rus­sia have also rolled out their own vac­cines.</p>
    <p>With Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tions un­der way in some coun­tries and ex­pected to start in Sin­ga­pore soon, the ques­tion now is how open peo­ple are to the idea.</p>
    <p>In the poll, about 18 per cent of re­spon­dents in­di­cated that they would not get a Covid-19 vac­cine, re­gard­less of whether one was avail­able to­day or in six to 12 months’ time.</p>
    <p>About half of this group were will­ing to con­sider get­ting one even­tu­ally, while the rest would not want to do so at all.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey, con­ducted by Milieu In­sight, found that the over­whelm­ing con­cern among those who were hes­i­tant about be­ing vac­ci­nated against Covid-19 was about safety, in­clud­ing pos­si­ble side ef­fects.</p>
    <p>While this is un­der­stand­able, given that Covid-19 vac­cines are new and have been de­vel­oped at un­usual speed, ex­perts stressed that ef­fi­cacy and safety are key con­sid­er­a­tions for reg­u­la­tors.</p>
