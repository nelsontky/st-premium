    <p>A cre­ative di­rec­tor­ship at a her­itage-steeped house used to be the holy grail of fash­ion, with young de­sign­ers gun­ning for top po­si­tions at brands owned by con­glom­er­ates such as LVMH, Ker­ing and Richemont.</p>
    <p>Scor­ing one meant an in­stant stamp of ap­proval from the es­tab­lish­ment and pro­vided a short­cut to star­dom and huge pay­days.</p>
    <p>De­sign­ers who made their name helm­ing her­itage houses in­clude John Gal­liano and Alexan­der McQueen at Givenchy, Ni­co­las Gh­esquiere at Ba­len­ci­aga, Christo­pher Bai­ley at Burberry and Tom Ford at Gucci.</p>
    <p>In the past decade, though, as fash­ion and me­dia changed be­yond recog­ni­tion, cracks started show­ing in the sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Both Gal­liano and McQueen ex­pe­ri­enced falls as dra­matic as their as­cen­sions. Gal­liano’s suc­ces­sor at Dior, Raf Si­mons, burnt out from the in­ten­sity and was later un­cer­e­mo­ni­ously ousted from his next job at Calvin Klein.</p>
    <p>Al­ber El­baz suf­fered the same fate at Lan­vin, de­spite turn­ing the for­tunes of the French brand around. Gh­esquiere left Ba­len­ci­aga em­broiled in an ugly spat while the stint of his suc­ces­sor, Alexan­der Wang, was marked by lack­lus­tre show­ings and an abrupt exit.</p>
    <p>Per­haps burnt out by the in­creas­ingly sped-up and cor­po­ra­tised fash­ion world, a whole host of star de­sign­ers have left high-pro­file po­si­tions in re­cent years and have so far opted out of re­join­ing the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The most no­table ab­sence of Phoebe Philo, who left Ce­line after trans­form­ing the once-for­got­ten brand into a money­maker and crit­i­cal dar­ling for French lux­ury con­glom­er­ate LVMH, had Philophile­s clam­our­ing for an epony­mous la­bel. But the fa­mously reclu­sive de­signer has so far re­mained mum.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers have piv­oted to char­ity work: Frida Gian­nini, ousted from Gucci in 2014, now sits on the board of Save The Chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Bouchra Jar­rar, who left Lan­vin after only 16 months, is work­ing with the Musee des Art Dec­o­rat­ifs to cre­ate pro­grammes that ben­e­fit dis­ad­van­taged young women.</p>
    <p>Some have ex­plored dif­fer­ent branches of de­sign. Jonathan Saun­ders, who led Diane von Fursten­berg for 18 months, is now de­sign­ing fur­ni­ture; while Alessan­dra Facchinett­i, who was last at Tod’s, most re­cently de­signed cos­tumes for the Don Carlo opera at Switzer­land’s The­ater St Gallen.</p>
    <p>While the in­dus­try waits with bated breath to see how El­baz’s joint ven­ture with lux­ury group Richemont would take shape, a small group of de­sign­ers are re­think­ing the way they want to play the fash­ion game.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing clocked in time at the most hal­lowed houses in Paris and Mi­lan, from Schi­a­par­elli to Saint Lau­rent to So­nia Rykiel, they re­alise the old way of do­ing things is no longer fea­si­ble in a rapidly chang­ing land­scape.</p>
    <p>These vi­sion­ary minds are find­ing new paths for­ward by pro­mot­ing thought­ful con­sump­tion and small­er­scale pro­duc­tions, re­ject­ing ex­ces­sive con­sumerism, in­stant grat­i­fi­ca­tion and throw­away cul­ture.</p>
