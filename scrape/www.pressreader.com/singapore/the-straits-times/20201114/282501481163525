    <p>•</p>
    <p>Be­fore the coro­n­avirus, a decades-long avi­a­tion boom spawned a net­work of nearly 50,000 air routes that tra­versed the world. In less than a year, the pan­demic has wiped al­most a third of them off the map.</p>
    <p>Bor­der clo­sures, na­tion­wide lock­downs and the fear of catch­ing Covid-19 from fel­low pas­sen­gers have crip­pled com­mer­cial travel.</p>
    <p>As thou­sands of do­mes­tic and in­ter­na­tional con­nec­tions dis­ap­pear com­pletely from air­line timeta­bles, the world has sud­denly stopped shrink­ing.</p>
    <p>The cri­sis is un­wind­ing a vast so­cial and in­dus­trial over­haul that took place dur­ing half a cen­tury of air travel pro­lif­er­a­tion. In years to come, over­seas busi­ness trips and hol­i­days will likely mean more air­port stopovers, longer jour­ney times, and per­haps an ad­di­tional mode of trans­port.</p>
    <p>Even when an ef­fec­tive vac­cine is found, the eco­nomic re­al­ity of the re­cov­ery may mean some non-stop flights are gone for good.</p>
    <p>With bor­ders ef­fec­tively shut glob­ally, the bulk of the world’s dropped routes are in­evitably cross-bor­der. But thou­sands of do­mes­tic legs have also been axed, re­flect­ing the pres­sure air­lines face at home as they cut jobs and re­tire air­craft to find a cost base that re­flects their shrunken si­t­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>In late Jan­uary, 47,756 op­er­a­tional routes criss-crossed the world, more than half of them in the United States, Western Europe and North-east Asia, ac­cord­ing to in­dus­try con­sul­tancy OAG Avi­a­tion World­wide. By Nov 2, there were just 33,416 routes on global sched­ules, the data shows.</p>
    <p>In Her­vey Bay, a small tourist town on Aus­tralia’s east coast, res­i­dents are mourn­ing their last di­rect air con­nec­tion with Syd­ney, the na­tion’s main do­mes­tic and in­ter­na­tional gate­way. The flight was one of eight re­gional routes scrapped by Vir­gin Aus­tralia af­ter it col­lapsed in April un­der A$6.8 bil­lion (S$6.65 bil­lion) of debt.</p>
    <p>“We’re liv­ing in hope that they come back,” said the re­gional coun­cil’s deputy mayor Dar­ren Ever­ard, who is re­spon­si­ble for eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment in the area.</p>
    <p>Among those hard­est hit is a lo­cal man­u­fac­turer of truck body parts who re­lied on the flight to reach buy­ers in Syd­ney, he added.</p>
    <p>GLOBAL MO­BIL­ITY</p>
    <p>Her­vey Bay, more than three hours’ drive north of Queens­land’s state cap­i­tal Bris­bane, is best known as a jump­ing-off point for whale-watch­ing tours and trips to nearby Fraser Is­land.</p>
    <p>The town’s Syd­ney flight is one of more than 14,000 con­nec­tions that have been aban­doned glob­ally since the pan­demic broke out, ac­cord­ing to OAG.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s cap­i­tal, Can­berra, has been scrubbed from in­ter­na­tional maps too. The city has no more di­rect flights over­seas af­ter Sin­ga­pore Air­lines ceased ser­vices from Sin­ga­pore in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>“It will take a good four or five years for con­nec­tiv­ity to re­turn to the same level we saw at the end of 2019,” said Mr Sub­has Menon, di­rec­tor-gen­eral of the As­so­ci­a­tion of Asia-Pa­cific Air­lines, which rep­re­sents re­gional car­ri­ers, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore Air­lines and Cathay Pa­cific Air­ways. “Some of th­ese routes may never be put back.”</p>
    <p>All this erodes avi­a­tion’s fi­nan</p>
    <p>cial clout. But it is the blow to air­lines’ con­tri­bu­tion to global mo­bil­ity and so­cial op­por­tu­nity that is harder to mea­sure.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pan­demic, the in­dus­try sup­ported 65.5 mil­lion jobs – more than half of them in­di­rectly through tourism – and had a global eco­nomic im­pact of US$2.7 tril­lion (S$3.6 tril­lion), ac­cord­ing to the 2019 Avi­a­tion Ben­e­fits Re­port, a study by in­dus­try groups in­clud­ing the In­ter­na­tional Civil Avi­a­tion Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>FRAG­ILE MAR­GINS</p>
    <p>To be sure, many air­lines are adding routes at home to tap pent-up de</p>
    <p>mand in what is ef­fec­tively their only func­tion­ing mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Com­mer­cial air­line traf­fic in the US was back to more than half of pre-virus lev­els at the end of last month, ac­cord­ing to data from flight track­ing ser­vice FlightAwar­e; in China, it has al­most re­turned to reg­u­lar lev­els.</p>
    <p>And Sin­ga­pore Air­lines ear­lier this week restarted its non-stop ser­vice be­tween Sin­ga­pore and New York, the world’s long­est flight, as the coun­try strug­gles to re­tain its rel­e­vance as a global avi­a­tion hub.</p>
    <p>In Asia alone, 790 new routes are run­ning this month that did not ex­ist a year ago, ac­cord­ing to avi­a­tion an­a­lyt­ics firm Cir­ium. The eastern Chi­nese city of Yiwu in Zhe­jiang prov­ince, for in­stance, is sched­uled to get 90 new di­rect flights from Bei­jing this month.</p>
    <p>But far out­num­ber­ing th­ese new con­nec­tions are the 2,279 routes in Asia that are not op­er­at­ing any more. In Novem­ber last year, there were more than 1,000 sched­uled flights be­tween Al­maty and Nur-Sul­tan in Kaza­khstan, the data show. This month, there is none.</p>
    <p>In the US, Amer­i­can Air­lines Group chief ex­ec­u­tive Doug Parker warned last month that parts of the coun­try risk be­ing cut off un­less there is more sup­port from the gov­ern­ment. “There will ab­so­lutely be dis­con­tin­u­a­tion of ser­vice to small com­mu­ni­ties, and there will be much less ser­vice to larger com­mu­ni­ties,” he said in an Oct 8 in­ter­view on CNBC.</p>
    <p>He said the air­line has stopped fly­ing to 13 US cities and ex­tended those cuts un­til this month.</p>
    <p>Routes with the most frag­ile profit mar­gins will be the first to go, while air­lines will try to keep the con­nec­tions that feed pas­sen­gers into larger travel hubs, said Mr Dirk-Maarten Mole­naar, the Am­s­ter­dam-based head of Bos­ton Con­sult­ing Group’s travel and tourism prac­tice for Europe, the Mid­dle East and North Africa.</p>
    <p>“For the next cou­ple of years, there will be a num­ber of su­per-thin routes you can’t jus­tify fly­ing,” he said.</p>
