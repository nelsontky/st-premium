    <p>Vet­eran Hong Kong ac­tor John Chi­ang (above, right) has de­nied that Tai­wanese su­per­star Jay Chou (above, left) is his il­le­git­i­mate son, af­ter an old claim made by his half-brother, di­rec­tor Derek Yee, resur­faced re­cently.</p>
    <p>Yee, 62, is one of the judges on Chi­nese re­al­ity show Ev­ery­body Stand By 2, and his sharp com­ments have led to ne­ti­zens dig­ging out re­marks he made in 2013.</p>
    <p>Yee had then said he was shocked when he first saw Chou, as the singer-song­writer looked like the younger ver­sion of his half- brother.</p>
    <p>Yee even went to do a check and found that Chi­ang was in­deed in Tai­wan 10 months be­fore Chou, now 41, was born in Jan­uary 1979.</p>
    <p>Chi­ang, 73, is mar­ried to for­mer ac­tress Mag­gie Li, 71, and the cou­ple have two daugh­ters and one son.</p>
    <p>The vet­eran ac­tor, whose English name is of­ten wrongly as­sumed to be David Chi­ang, re­acted to the old claim on Wed­nes­day, when he at­tended a movie pre­miere with his son John Chi­ang Jr.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally hope it’s true,” he said jok­ingly. “I would have re­tired by now if he (Jay Chou) is my il­le­git­i­mate son.”</p>
    <p>The younger Chi­ang then smiled and said “sorry” to his fa­ther, who added: “He would not have to work too if Jay Chou were his brother.”</p>
    <p>The el­der Chi­ang then said: “Many peo­ple have said we look alike and I think it could be due to the an­gle of the pho­tos.”</p>
    <p>Chou’s re­sem­blance to Chi­ang has been noted as far back as 2004, when he was film­ing the Hong Kong movie Ini­tial D (2005). The Tai­wanese su­per­star even in­vited Chi­ang to play his older self in the movie The Rooftop (2013), which Chou wrote and di­rected.</p>
    <p>Chou’s fans have urged all par­ties to spare a thought for Chou’s mother Yeh Hui-mei, and said such talk could be em­bar­rass­ing for her. She is di­vorced from Chou’s fa­ther Chou Yao-chung.</p>
