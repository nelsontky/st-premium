    <p>A large num­ber of vot­ers from Malaysia’s Sabah state who live in the penin­su­lar re­gion of the coun­try might not be able to re­turn home to take part in the state’s election this week, po­ten­tially af­fect­ing the voter turnout for the in­cum­bent Warisan Plus, which is aligned with the fed­eral op­po­si­tion Pakatan Hara­pan.</p>
    <p>An es­ti­mated one-fifth of all reg­is­tered Sabah vot­ers work in penin­su­lar Malaysia, a 21/ 2- hour flight from the east­ern state. Many of them can­not af­ford the re­turn jour­ney, with flight tick­ets at RM350 (S$115) on av­er­age, per per­son.</p>
    <p>But the Pu­lang Men­gundi Sabah (Re­turn and Vote, Sabah) ini­tia­tive is hop­ing to ad­dress this prob­lem. Youth lead­ers across the coun­try, who are be­hind the ini­tia­tive, have been rais­ing funds to send young Saba­hans home to vote in Satur­day’s polls.</p>
    <p>They have col­lected more than RM75,000 to date, enough to send 214 Saba­hans home for the polls. How­ever, 6,000 had ap­plied for the spon­sored flights, il­lus­trat­ing the vol­ume of out-of-state vot­ers who are un­able to re­turn home to vote.</p>
    <p>“We were quite sur­prised be­cause we were not ex­pect­ing this fig­ure at the start,” said one of the co­or­di­na­tors, Mr Aaron Deni­son.</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old said only half of the out of state vot­ers might be able to re­turn for the election.</p>
    <p>An­other co­or­di­na­tor, Ms Zariah Zakaria, said 80 per cent of the ap­pli­cants be­long to the B40 cat­e­gory – the low­est in­come group.</p>
    <p>Sabah is home to more than 3 mil­lion peo­ple, around 10 per cent of Malaysia’s pop­u­la­tion, but it has the third-low­est gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) per capita among the coun­try’s states and ter­ri­to­ries, prompt­ing many Saba­hans to seek a liv­ing in penin­su­lar Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Depart­ment of Statis­tics Malaysia, Sabah also has the sec­ond-low­est me­dian monthly</p>
    <p>NOT MUCH IM­PACT</p>
    <p>in­come among Malaysian states – al­most half of the me­dian in­come in Kuala Lumpur and Malaysia’s rich­est state, Se­lan­gor.</p>
    <p>The three dis­tricts with the low­est me­dian in­come na­tion­wide are all in Sabah – Pi­tas, Ton­god and Kota Marudu.</p>
    <p>Although the do­na­tion drive ended on Tues­day, Ms Zariah, 25, is still hop­ing to raise enough money to even­tu­ally send 500 Saba­hans home un­der the ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of In­ter­na­tional Af­fairs se­nior fel­low Oh Ei Sun told The Straits Times that those who do not re­turn to cast their votes are likely to dent the turnout for Warisan, led by in­cum­bent Chief Min­is­ter Shafie Ap­dal.</p>
    <p>“Their in­abil­ity or un­will­ing­ness to go back to Sabah to vote would there­fore have a dis­pro­por­tion­ate im­pact on Warisan Plus’ turnout,” Dr Oh said, adding that these vot­ers are more likely to vote for Warisan.</p>
    <p>Dr Oh also said these vot­ers, hav­ing worked in cos­mopoli­tan set­tings, are more ex­posed to pro­gres­sive per­sua­sions, and could lean to­wards Warisan, whose cam­paign theme has been mul­ti­cul­tural and multi-re­li­gious unity in Sabah.</p>
    <p>Apart from eco­nomic re­al­i­ties, the uptick of Covid-19 cases be­ing re­ported in Sabah, es­pe­cially in the east coast of the state, could fur­ther dis­cour­age out-of-state vot­ers.</p>
    <p>Over the past fort­night alone, Sabah re­ported 626 Covid-19 cases, which is 85 per cent of all Covid-19 cases re­ported across Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Ms Zariah, who is from Tawau, one of the worst-af­fected dis­tricts in Sabah, said the case num­bers are a “huge con­cern” for vot­ers.</p>
    <p>“Some vot­ers in Tawau are al­ready con­sid­er­ing not vot­ing due to the sit­u­a­tion,” she said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Pro­fes­sor James Chin of the Univer­sity of Tas­ma­nia said the non-re­turn­ing vot­ers are un­likely to have a huge im­pact on the election out­come at this stage.</p>
    <p>“Most of the ur­ban ar­eas are al­ready pro-Warisan. So if they bring peo­ple back to the ur­ban ar­eas, it is not go­ing to af­fect the re­sults,” said Prof Chin, an ex­pert on gov­er­nance is­sues in South-east Asia, es­pe­cially Malaysia, In­done­sia and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>But he said re­turn­ing vot­ers might make an im­pact in semi-ru­ral state seats which are con­sid­ered to be tightly con­tested hot seats.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he noted that it might be too late to re­turn as travel within Sabah is lim­ited – with all forms of trans­port fully booked for the state polls, mak­ing it dif­fi­cult for vot­ers to make the in­trastate jour­ney to their con­stituen­cies.</p>
    <p>“Then again, we are talk­ing about a few hun­dred votes per seat, so it might not make such a big im­pact,” Prof Chin said.</p>
    <p>Most of the ur­ban ar­eas are al­ready pro-Warisan. So if they bring peo­ple back to the ur­ban ar­eas it is not go­ing to af­fect the re­sults.</p>
    <p>PRO­FES­SOR JAMES CHIN, of the Univer­sity of Tas­ma­nia, who is an ex­pert on gov­er­nance is­sues in South-east Asia, es­pe­cially Malaysia, In­done­sia and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
