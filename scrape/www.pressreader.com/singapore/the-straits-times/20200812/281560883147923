    <p>In­vestors have backed the de-merger of Sem­b­corp Marine from par­ent Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries un­der a $2.1 bil­lion plan that will see Te­masek take a big stake in the firm. Three res­o­lu­tions re­lat­ing to the re­cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion plan aimed at putting Sem­bMarine on a more se­cure foot­ing were well sup­ported at two ex­tra­or­di­nary gen­eral meet­ings.</p>
    <p>In­vestors have backed the de­merger of Sem­b­corp Marine from par­ent Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries un­der a $2.1 bil­lion plan that will see Te­masek take a big di­rect stake in the off­shore marine firm.</p>
    <p>Three res­o­lu­tions re­lat­ing to the re­cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion plan aimed at putting Sem­bMarine on a more se­cure foot­ing were well sup­ported at two ex­tra­or­di­nary gen­eral meet­ings (EGMs) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Sem­bMarine has been bleed­ing badly amid an oil price crash and fall­out from the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Once the pro­posed trans­ac­tions are com­pleted, Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries will be free to fo­cus on its en­ergy and ur­ban de­vel­op­ment business, while Te­masek will be­come a di­rect in­vestor in Sem­bMarine, with a 30.1 per cent to 58.1 per cent stake, de­pend­ing on fi­nal sub­scrip­tion lev­els.</p>
    <p>The out­come of the votes was even more keenly watched af­ter the sur­prise news on Mon­day that Te­masek has dropped its $4.1 bil­lion bid for con­trol of Kep­pel Corp.</p>
    <p>The Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries EGM recorded a vote of 99.67 per cent, or hold­ers of 302.6 mil­lion shares, in favour of its move to dis­trib­ute its shares in specie.</p>
    <p>There was a sim­i­lar level of sup­port at the Sem­bMarine meet­ing ear­lier in the day, with 98.76 per cent, or hold­ers of 1.4 bil­lion shares, back­ing the rights is­sue, while 87.72 per cent, or hold­ers of 121.3 mil­lion shares, green­lit what is called a white­wash res­o­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>This waives in­vestor rights to re­ceive a manda­tory takeover of­fer from Te­masek.</p>
    <p>The res­o­lu­tion from Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries and the two from Sem­bMarine re­quired sim­ple ma­jori­ties but all three were in­ter-con­di­tional.</p>
    <p>Sem­bMarine noted that the rights is­sue backed by share­hold­ers would “de­pend on the out­come of the Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries-dis­tri­bu­tion res­o­lu­tion” tabled to its in­vestors.</p>
    <p>Both firms called for trad­ing halts yes­ter­day morn­ing ahead of the EGMs. Af­ter the halts were lifted around noon, Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries shares rose by as much as 3.9 per cent be­fore end­ing down 2.63 per cent at $1.85.</p>
    <p>GROWTH OP­POR­TU­NI­TIES</p>
    <p>We will be able to ded­i­cate our re­sources to repo­si­tion­ing our busi­nesses and cap­tur­ing these growth op­por­tu­ni­ties. These in­clude op­por­tu­ni­ties in the re­new­able en­ergy sec­tor where SCI (Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries) is al­ready one of Sin­ga­pore’s largest home-grown re­new­able en­ergy</p>
    <p>’’ players.</p>
    <p>MR WONG KIM YIN, Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries group pres­i­dent and chief ex­ec­u­tive, on the com­pany mov­ing for­ward as a fo­cused en­ergy and ur­ban player.</p>
    <p>Sem­bMarine stock rose 2.86 per cent be­fore los­ing the gains to close down 2.86 per cent at 34 cents.</p>
    <p>KGI Se­cu­ri­ties an­a­lyst Joel Ng told The Straits Times that Te­masek’s axing of its $4.1 bil­lion of­fer for Kep­pel could see cap­i­tal re­de­ployed to Sem­bMarine and to buy Kep­pel Off­shore & Marine as­sets.</p>
    <p>“If not for the im­pact of Covid-19 on the val­u­a­tion of Kep­pel, and the huge im­pair­ments it sus­tained, the $4.1 bil­lion deal could have gone for­ward. But the end goal is still to con­sol­i­date Sin­ga­pore’s off­shore marine sec­tor,” Mr Ng said.</p>
    <p>OCBC In­vest­ment Re­search has a “sell” rat­ing on Sem­bMarine, say­ing that re­cov­ery is still a long way off as there were “no sig­nif­i­cant new con­tracts se­cured in the first half of 2020, and net or­der book as of end June stood at $1.9 bil­lion”.</p>
    <p>“The re­pairs and up­grad­ing business had out­stand­ing or­ders worth $280 mil­lion. We con­tinue to see mul­ti­ple head­winds on low or­der book clar­ity, high debt and cap­i­tal ex­pen­di­ture re­quire­ments.”</p>
    <p>Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries group pres­i­dent and chief ex­ec­u­tive Wong Kim Yin said the com­pany can now move for­ward as a fo­cused en­ergy and ur­ban player. “We will be able to ded­i­cate our re­sources to repo­si­tion­ing our busi­nesses and cap­tur­ing these growth op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>“These in­clude op­por­tu­ni­ties in the re­new­able en­ergy sec­tor where SCI (Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries) is al­ready one of Sin­ga­pore’s largest homegrown re­new­able en­ergy players.</p>
    <p>“We are also en­cour­aged that we can pro­vide sup­port to Sem­b­corp Marine... that will en­able it to bet­ter ride through the down­turn and po­si­tion it­self for re­cov­ery. Our share­hold­ers can now ex­pect to re­ceive shares in a stronger re­cap­i­talised Sem­bMarine.”</p>
    <p>In the days lead­ing up to the EGMs, Sem­bMarine had stressed that funds from the re­cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion would be key to fix­ing its “crit­i­cal” liq­uid­ity needs and that the rights is­sue would pro­vide “much-needed re­cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion” to ride out the off­shore marine in­dus­try down­turn, strengthen its bal­ance sheet and re­po­si­tion the firm for long-term vi­a­bil­ity.</p>
