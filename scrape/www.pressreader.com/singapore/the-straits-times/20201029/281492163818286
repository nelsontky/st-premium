    <p>EN­SURE BUD­GET IS PASSED</p>
    <p>Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah calls on MPs to re­spect His Majesty’s ad­vice to cease all po­lit­i­cal quar­rels and in­stead pri­ori­tise the pub­lic wel­fare and na­tional pros­per­ity to en­sure Bud­get 2021 is passed with­out dis­tur­bance.</p>
    <p>Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah also ex­presses full con­fi­dence in the abil­ity of Tan Sri Muhyid­din to lead the coun­try dur­ing this time when the na­tion is be­ing tested with var­i­ous crises.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s King yes­ter­day re­peated his call for MPs to “give ful­some sup­port” for the up­com­ing Bud­get that is set to be tabled in Par­lia­ment on Nov 6.</p>
    <p>The palace said this in a state­ment af­ter the King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah, met Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin in the morn­ing to re­ceive a brief­ing on the cru­cial sup­ply Bill.</p>
    <p>“Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah calls on MPs to re­spect His Majesty’s ad­vice to cease all po­lit­i­cal quar­rels and in­stead pri­ori­tise the pub­lic wel­fare and na­tional pros­per­ity to en­sure Bud­get 2021 is passed with­out dis­tur­bance,” said Royal Comptrolle­r Ah­mad Fadil Sham­sud­din.</p>
    <p>The King had on Sun­day re­jected Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s con­tro­ver­sial re­quest for emer­gency pow­ers, an em­bar­rass­ing set­back for the Premier who gov­erns with a slim ma­jor­ity that is be­ing threat­ened by ri­val par­ties.</p>
    <p>De­spite turn­ing down Mr</p>
    <p>Muhyid­din’s pro­posal, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah had di­rected politi­cians to cease un­der­min­ing the sta­bil­ity of the gov­ern­ment amid a resur­gent coro­n­avirus pan­demic, which the ruler said was be­ing well han­dled by the Muhyid­din ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>“Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah also ex­presses full con­fi­dence in the abil­ity of Tan Sri Muhyid­din to lead the coun­try dur­ing this time when the na­tion is be­ing tested with var­i­ous crises,” Datuk Fadil added.</p>
    <p>The royal de­cree comes just two days af­ter Umno, Mr Muhyid­din’s largest ally, held a se­ries of marathon meet­ings to de­cide whether to con­tinue sup­port­ing his Perikatan Na­sional (PN) pact.</p>
    <p>Umno had pre­vi­ously threat­ened to exit PN and dis­man­tle the Muhyid­din gov­ern­ment’s wafer­thin ma­jor­ity, due to un­hap­pi­ness over hav­ing to cede con­trol of Sabah last month to the Premier’s Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia. Also, Ber­satu has the lion’s share of fed­eral min­is­te­rial posts de­spite hav­ing fewer law­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>PN has just 113 out of 222 mem­bers of the Lower House, with Umno sup­ply­ing 39 of them.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, lead­ers of the main op­po­si­tion al­liance Pakatan Hara</p>
    <p>pan (PH) are meet­ing today to de­cide its strat­egy for the Bud­get ses­sion, with those aligned to op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim still in­tent on test­ing Mr Muhyid­din’s sup­port in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Subang MP Wong Chen said that the op­po­si­tion should ex­tract con­ces­sions for its ap­proval of the Bud­get.</p>
    <p>“The Bud­get vote then be­comes the one and only sil­ver bul­let the op­po­si­tion has to test the le­git­i­macy of the gov­ern­ment. There­fore, we can’t sim­ply sur­ren­der this sil­ver bul­let to the Prime Min­is­ter for free,” Mr Wong, who is from Datuk Seri An­war’s Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat (PKR), said in a Face­book post yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“In­stead, we must con­sider us­ing this... to ob­tain some much needed re­forms to save democ­racy,” he added.</p>
    <p>“On the very top of my list... is to give an un­fet­tered right to the op­po­si­tion to ta­ble a vote of no-con­fi­dence mo­tion in Par­lia­ment.”</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment Speaker Azhar Az­izan Harun said yes­ter­day that de­spite re­ceiv­ing more than 16 mo­tions of no con­fi­dence against Mr</p>
    <p>Muhyid­din, as well as con­fi­dence mo­tions from rul­ing pact law­mak­ers, these would not be pri­ori­tised over gov­ern­ment busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“There are many more im­por­tant mo­tions we have re­ceived apart from fo­cus­ing on the up­com­ing tabling of Bud­get 2021. We will ar­range them ac­cord­ing to gov­ern­ment busi­ness fore­mostly,” he was quoted as say­ing by Utu­san Malaysia.</p>
    <p>By con­ven­tion, the fail­ure to pass a sup­ply Bill to fund the gov­ern­ment is akin to a no-con­fi­dence mo­tion that would re­sult in the col­lapse of the Muhyid­din ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din would then have to re­sign, a move that could trig­ger snap polls as no other MP ap­pears to be able to com­mand a par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>PKR pres­i­dent An­war has re­peat­edly claimed in the past month that he has a “strong, con­vinc­ing, for­mi­da­ble ma­jor­ity” to form a new gov­ern­ment but has failed to prove this as­ser­tion.</p>
    <p>ROYAL COMPTROLLE­R AH­MAD FADIL SHAM­SUD­DIN, in a state­ment from the palace af­ter Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah met Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin to re­ceive a brief­ing on the cru­cial sup­ply Bill.</p>
