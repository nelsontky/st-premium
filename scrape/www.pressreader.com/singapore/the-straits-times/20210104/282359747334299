    <p>Those familiar with mi­gra­tory birds in Sin­ga­pore would prob­a­bly have heard of the Sungei Bu­loh Wet­land Re­serve.</p>
    <p>Nes­tled in the coun­try’s north­west, the mud­flats of the re­serve serve as a buf­fet spread for flocks of mi­gra­tory birds, es­pe­cially shore­birds – a di­verse group of birds best as­so­ci­ated with coastal wet­lands.</p>
    <p>In­deed, these trav­ellers throng the coastal flats in Sungei Bu­loh and off­shore Pu­lau Ubin each year dur­ing the north­ern hemi­sphere’s win­ter months.</p>
    <p>Two of the most fre­quently seen birds are the lanky com­mon red­shank (Tringa totanus), named for its bright red legs, and the whim­brel (Nu­me­nius phaeo­pus), a large, striking shore­bird with a dis­tinct curved bill. Both are of­ten seen here from late July, when they ar­rive from far­ther north.</p>
    <p>Bird mi­gra­tion is a phe­nom­e­non that has been ob­served for mil­len­nia. But many ques­tions re­main.</p>
    <p>How do these birds travel thousands of kilo­me­tres to reach Sin­ga­pore? How do they re­turn each year? What routes do they take?</p>
    <p>AIR TRAVEL</p>
    <p>A study led by re­searchers at the Na­tional Parks Board (NParks) threw up sur­prises last month.</p>
    <p>By at­tach­ing de­vices to track the move­ments of com­mon red­shanks and whim­brels, they found that these com­mon vis­i­tors to Sin­ga­pore had trav­elled across the Hi­malayan moun­tain range be­fore ar­riv­ing here.</p>
    <p>The jour­neys show that species in Sin­ga­pore and more widely along the Malay Penin­sula are also con­nected with the less stud­ied mi­gra­tory routes of the Cen­tral Asian Fly­way (CAF).</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, many of the shore­birds that reach Sin­ga­pore were pre­sumed to have come via the bet­ter-known East Asian-Aus­tralasian Fly­way (EAAF).</p>
    <p>Fly­ways are like high­ways in the sky – many species take these broad set of mi­gra­tory routes when they head from breeding grounds in the north to feed­ing ar­eas in the trop­ics. There are about eight fly­ways in the world.</p>
    <p>In the lat­est study, the re­searchers found that ev­ery com­mon red­shank tracked mi­grated north in spring to­wards the cold up­lands of the Ti­betan Plateau.</p>
    <p>To un­der­take such a phys­i­cally daunt­ing jour­ney, the red­shanks, each weigh­ing less than half an av­er­age cof­fee mug, must gain alti­tude rapidly to ne­go­ti­ate the lofty peaks of the Hi­malayas or the moun­tains on the eastern flank of Tibet. These mi­gra­tions in­volve trav­el­ling up to 5,000km each way and gain­ing con­sid­er­able el­e­va­tion of well over 4,000m be­fore ar­riv­ing at their breeding ar­eas on the plateau’s wet­lands.</p>
    <p>One of the whim­brels stud­ied flew across the Hi­malayas and the Ti­betan plateau on its jour­ney to­wards the sub-Arc­tic tun­dra on the north-west fringe of the Cen­tral Siberian plateau, while the rest of the birds flew along the coast of East Asia to­wards the Yel­low Sea be­fore head­ing north into Siberia.</p>
    <p>Mi­gra­tory birds trav­el­ling along the CAF tra­verse sig­nif­i­cant eco­log­i­cal-ge­o­graph­i­cal bar­ri­ers and bound­aries, in­clud­ing cross­ing the world’s high­est moun­tains.</p>
    <p>These birds fly over or go to the Taiga-Tun­dra ecosys­tems of Siberia, the Gobi Desert, the Ti­betan Plateau and the for­mi­da­ble moun­tains of Cen­tral Asia and the Hi­malayas be­fore reach­ing their win­ter desti­na­tions on the rich low­lands of the In­dian sub­con­ti­nent.</p>
    <p>We now know that some of these birds also move be­yond the sub­con­ti­nent be­fore stream­ing into our part of the world, and in the process have to ne­go­ti­ate the high­est moun­tain ranges on the planet.</p>
    <p>The EAAF, how­ever, presents less of a phys­i­cal chal­lenge. Most mi­gra­tory birds us­ing this route typ­i­cally move along the coastal low­lands of East Asia dur­ing the au­tumn, be­fore fun­nelling through South-east Asia, and on­wards to Aus­tralia and New Zealand.</p>
    <p>These dis­cov­er­ies chal­lenge the cur­rent think­ing on the large-scale ecol­ogy of mi­gra­tory birds in Asia, but also re­mind us how lit­tle we know about the bi­ol­ogy of these birds, many which are now in danger of ex­tinc­tion due to threats like habi­tat loss and hunt­ing.</p>
    <p>The hope is that the use of tech­nol­ogy in the study of mi­gra­tory birds will con­tinue to yield sim­i­larly ex­cit­ing in­sights that can guide con­ser­va­tion ef­forts tar­get­ing these glo­be­trot­ting species.</p>
    <p>Satel­lite track­ing de­vices are widely used by re­searchers for study­ing an­i­mal move­ments, and they send reg­u­lar sig­nals to a satel­lite in low or­bit, al­low­ing the spe­cific lo­ca­tions of an an­i­mal to be mon­i­tored in real time.</p>
    <p>In the lat­est study, the re­searchers found that ev­ery com­mon red­shank tracked mi­grated north in spring to­wards the cold up­lands of the Ti­betan Plateau. To un­der­take such a phys­i­cally daunt­ing jour­ney, the red­shanks, each weigh­ing less than half an av­er­age cof­fee mug, must gain alti­tude rapidly to ne­go­ti­ate the lofty peaks of the high Hi­malayas or the moun­tains on the eastern flank of Tibet.</p>
    <p>Care­ful at­tach­ments of these de­vices on the birds’ back (of­ten like a back­pack) al­low sci­en­tists to re­motely track and ob­serve their move­ments.</p>
    <p>These de­vices are tiny – they weigh less than 3 per cent of the bird’s weight – and do not in­flu­ence its nat­u­ral be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers also use light-level ge­olo­ca­tors. These tiny de­vices are cheaper than satel­lite tags and weigh less, as lit­tle as a third of a gram, and are in­creas­ingly be­ing used by sci­en­tists to study the mi­gra­tion of smaller birds.</p>
    <p>How­ever, un­like satel­lite tags that can trans­mit data from afar, the use of ge­olo­ca­tors re­quires re­searchers to re­cap­ture the an­i­mal to re­trieve data.</p>
    <p>FEATH­ERED AM­BAS­SADORS</p>
    <p>Com­pared to the charis­matic rain­for­est species of South-east Asia, mi­gra­tory birds may not al­ways be the most familiar group of wildlife.</p>
    <p>Many species are small, dull­coloured and not par­tic­u­larly con­spic­u­ous. Even sci­en­tists and sea­soned bird watch­ers have a hard time find­ing or iden­ti­fy­ing them.</p>
    <p>But these feath­ered trav­ellers show us how in­ter­con­nected the planet is.</p>
    <p>Eco­log­i­cal con­nec­tiv­ity is an im­por­tant con­cept in con­ser­va­tion strate­gies and is de­fined by the</p>
    <p>United Na­tions as the de­gree to which land­scapes and seascapes al­low species to move freely, while en­sur­ing eco­log­i­cal pro­cesses can con­tinue to func­tion unim­peded.</p>
    <p>The main­te­nance of eco­log­i­cal con­nec­tiv­ity is crit­i­cal in com­bat­ing the de­cline of bio­di­ver­sity while en­sur­ing that na­ture con­tin­ues to de­liver ben­e­fits for peo­ple in the form of ecosys­tem ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Mi­gra­tory bird species are es­sen­tially flag­ships of “eco­log­i­cal con­nec­tiv­ity” be­cause they link the dif­fer­ent ecosys­tems they live in, and lit­er­ally drive the move­ment of nu­tri­ents and other bi­o­log­i­cal mat­ter across large dis­tances, while play­ing def­i­nite eco­log­i­cal roles in the very ecosys­tems they live in.</p>
    <p>The life cy­cles of birds such as the whim­brel and com­mon red­shank ef­fec­tively con­nect the high tun­dra they breed in with the var­i­ous in­land and coastal wet­lands they stop over at in their mi­gra­tory jour­neys across vast dis­tances in the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion.</p>
    <p>In essence, mi­gra­tory birds give a recog­nis­able “face” to the ecosys­tems they are as­so­ci­ated with at very large spa­tial scales, es­pe­cially coastal wet­lands which are in rapid de­cline all over the world.</p>
    <p>Mi­gra­tory birds also pro­vide op­por­tu­ni­ties to stim­u­late co­op­er­a­tion across na­tions.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, mi­gra­tory birds in gen­eral, and shore­birds in par­tic­u­lar, are gain­ing more lo­cal and global pro­fil­ing, thanks largely to the ef­forts of con­ser­va­tion­ists, re­searchers and gov­ern­ments.</p>
    <p>Less than a year ago, Myan­mar an­nounced its plan to ex­pand the Gulf of Mot­tama wet­lands as a “Wet­land of In­ter­na­tional Im­por­tance” un­der the Ram­sar Con­ven­tion in its bid to bet­ter pro­tect wa­ter­bird habi­tats, and the highly en­dan­gered spoon-billed sandpiper.</p>
    <p>In­dia has launched its first na­tional ac­tion plan for the CAF, fo­cused on pro­tect­ing more than 40 wet­lands for mi­gra­tory birds, and com­menc­ing work on sin­gle species’ ac­tion plans.</p>
    <p>The first sec­re­tariat to co­or­di­nate con­ser­va­tion ac­tiv­i­ties for mi­gra­tory birds in the CAF will also be es­tab­lished in In­dia.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, con­certed con­ser­va­tion ef­forts are un­der way in many South-east Asian coun­tries. The Bird Con­ser­va­tion So­ci­ety of Thai­land ac­quired an area of wet­lands along the In­ner Gulf of Thai­land early last year for use as a pri­vate na­ture re­serve for mi­gra­tory birds.</p>
    <p>THE ROLE OF THE LIT­TLE RED DOT</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the Gov­ern­ment re­cently an­nounced plans to ex­pand the Sungei Bu­loh Wet­land Re­serve to cover an ex­ten­sive sec­tion of the north­ern coast­line, ef­fec­tively putting more ar­eas of crit­i­cally im­por­tant mi­gra­tory shore­bird habi­tats and car­bon-rich wet­lands un­der con­ser­va­tion man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Emerg­ing knowl­edge from stud­ies such as the l at­est one by NParks, as well as data from gen­er­a­tions of cit­i­zen sci­en­tists and bird ringers, shows that Sin­ga­pore and the Malay Penin­sula sit along im­por­tant mi­gra­tory routes con­nect­ing both the East Asian and Cen­tral Asian fly­ways.</p>
    <p>More than 100 species of mi­gra­tory birds come here ev­ery year. Many stop by the forests and wet­lands to re­fuel and recharge be­fore con­tin­u­ing their jour­neys to In­done­sia and Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Shore­birds such as the com­mon red­shank and whim­brel are among the most familiar of the mi­gra­tory species here.</p>
    <p>Less familiar are the large num­bers of birds of prey such as honey buz­zards and spar­rowhawks, as well as lit­tle song­birds such as the Asian brown fly­catcher, Arc­tic war­bler and Siberian blue robin.</p>
    <p>The ap­pear­ance of striking mi­gra­tory species such as pit­tas, king­fish­ers and fly­catch­ers in the ur­ban sprawl, many se­verely in­jured or killed by col­li­sions with glass win­dows, is be­com­ing a mor­bid way for the pub­lic to learn about bird mi­gra­tion, as is the case for other big cities in Asia.</p>
    <p>Re­search such as the work led by NParks col­leagues to un­der­stand the ecol­ogy and jour­neys of mi­gra­tory birds is timely and adds a crit­i­cal piece to the wider jig­saw of the place of Sin­ga­pore’s ecosys­tems in the con­text of Asia.</p>
    <p>Per­haps a more im­por­tant take­away from study­ing mi­gra­tory birds is the con­stant re­minder that con­serv­ing bio­di­ver­sity, in this case mi­gra­tory species shared be­tween coun­tries, can ben­e­fit not only from lo­cal ef­forts but also through global co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Few groups of wildlife bring this out as strongly as mi­gra­tory birds.</p>
