    <p>Na­tional track and field body Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics (SA) passed a host of amend­ments to its con­sti­tu­tion on Mon­day night, af­ter a “ro­bust” five­hour ex­tra­or­di­nary gen­eral meet­ing (EOGM).</p>
    <p>How­ever, two pro­posed changes re­main un­re­solved.</p>
    <p>One is the move to keep pro­ceed­ings in man­age­ment com­mit­tee (MC) meet­ings con­fi­den­tial; cur­rently, mem­bers can in­spect them if they give one week’s no­tice to SA’s hon­orary sec­re­tary.</p>
    <p>The other is the re­moval of vot­ing rights for its ath­letes’ com­mis­sion rep­re­sen­ta­tive, which was in­tro­duced in 2018.</p>
    <p>Both pro­pos­als had sparked con­cerns among the fra­ter­nity ahead of the EOGM.</p>
    <p>Two SA af­fil­i­ates, Wings Ath­letic Club and Club Zoom, had reser­va­tions about the pro­posal for min­utes to be kept con­fi­den­tial, cit­ing the need for trans­parency and ac­count­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>Two-time SEA Games marathon cham­pion Soh Rui Yong, who sued SA for defama­tion last year over its state­ment on his non-se­lec­tion for the 2019 edi­tion of the Games, said in a Face­book post on Mon­day that propos­ing to re­move vot­ing rights for the ath­letes’ com­mis­sion rep­re­sen­ta­tive shows that SA “does not care for the opin­ions of its ath­letes”.</p>
    <p>Sources told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that a dis­agree­ment over vot­ing pro­ce­dures was the rea­son for the non-res­o­lu­tion. SA’s con­sti­tu­tion states that al­ter­ation or dele­tions to the char­ter can be passed only “with con­sent of two-thirds of vot­ing mem­bers present”.</p>
    <p>Af­ter two of the 20 mem­bers that at­tended the on­line EOGM ab­stained from vot­ing, those in assem­bly were di­vided. SA’s two le­gal ad­vis­ers present held dif­fer­ing views.</p>
    <p>One said that the two-thirds ma­jor­ity ap­plied to all 20 af­fil­i­ates, which means a to­tal of 14 votes was needed for an amend­ment. The other be­lieved the two-thirds ma­jor­ity should ap­ply only to the 18 who voted, which means only 12 votes are needed.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to ST’s queries yes­ter­day, SA pres­i­dent Tang Weng Fei, who chaired the meet­ing, con­firmed that the two un­re­solved ar­ti­cles re­quired the def­i­ni­tion of the two-thirds ma­jor­ity rule, and said that SA would seek “in­de­pen­dent le­gal opin­ion” on the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, he also said that a pro­posed new cri­te­ria for af­fil­i­ated mem­ber­ship – namely that clubs must align their con­sti­tu­tions with that of SA’s and sub­mit their an­nual re­ports, gen­eral meet­ing min­utes and fi­nan­cial re­ports – was re­moved. Some clubs felt the pro­posal was un­nec­es­sary as they are al­ready re­quired to sub­mit the doc­u­ments to the Registry of So­ci­eties.</p>
    <p>On the EOGM, Tang said: “It was a ro­bust meet­ing, which should be the case. It was nice to see every­one ac­tively par­tic­i­pat­ing in dis­cus­sions on how to take SA for­ward.</p>
    <p>“This bodes well for the fu­ture of the sport in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>While some amend­ments to the con­sti­tu­tion, such as the use of an elec­tronic vot­ing sys­tem for the elec­tion of of­fice bear­ers, lay the ground for SA’s elec­tions in Septem­ber, oth­ers were not linked.</p>
    <p>They in­clude the move to keep MC min­utes con­fi­den­tial, re­mov­ing the vot­ing right of the ath­letes’ com­mis­sion rep­re­sen­ta­tive, and up­ping the term for elected of­fi­cials from two years to four.</p>
    <p>Tang had told ST on Sun­day that</p>
    <p>“most of the pro­posed amend­ments are made in ac­cor­dance” with guide­lines from Sport Sin­ga­pore (SportSG), and the re­quire­ments of the Registry of So­ci­eties and the Com­mis­sioner of Char­i­ties.</p>
    <p>A SportSG spokesman yes­ter­day said that it “sup­ports the ef­forts by na­tional sports as­so­ci­a­tions (NSAs) to pro­fes­sion­alise and strengthen their gov­er­nance”.</p>
    <p>It had pro­vided guid­ance to the ath­let­ics body through a set of gov­er­nance prin­ci­ples for NSAs and a tem­plate of a model con­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>But the spokesman added: “We have given our views on their pro­posed amend­ments and re­quested (that SA) share with us the re­vised ver­sion.</p>
    <p>“SportSG has not re­viewed the lat­est amend­ments SA has cir­cu­lated to its mem­bers.”</p>
    <p>The na­tional sports agency also said it did not man­date spe­cific changes to the SA con­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing the length­ier term for elected SA of­fi­cials, the SportSG spokesman said that while it “sup­ports a four-year term for an NSA Board, which is aligned with the ma­jor Games cy­cles”, he stressed that “each NSA de­ter­mines the ap­pro­pri­ate term”.</p>
    <p>He also added that “SportSG also does not pre­scribe man­age­ment prac­tices of how min­utes of meet­ing are kept or dis­closed, ex­cept to em­pha­sise the need for proper record keep­ing”.</p>
    <p>GET­TING EVERY­ONE IN­VOLVED</p>
    <p>It was a ro­bust meet­ing, which should be the case. It was nice to see every­one ac­tively par­tic­i­pat­ing in dis­cus­sions on how to take SA for­ward. This bodes well for the fu­ture of the sport in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
