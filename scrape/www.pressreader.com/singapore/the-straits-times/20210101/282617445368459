    <p>Those who grew up in the 1980s and 1990s may fondly re­call “eraser wrestling”, in which play­ers col­lected erasers with coun­try flags printed on them and tried to flip them on top of their op­po­nents’.</p>
    <p>Re­visit those days with this eraser­wrestling con­test or­gan­ised at The Sub­sta­tion by as­so­ciate artist Shai­ful Risan as part of the Pro­pos­als For Novel Ways Of Be­ing ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>Shai­ful, 38, was an avid eraser wrestler in pri­mary school. It may seem like a ju­ve­nile pas­time, he says, but one could also see it as geopo­lit­i­cal al­le­gory. The project arose from his “ab­sur­dist hope” that in­ter­na­tional con­flicts might be eas­ily re­solved via eraser wrestling, in­stead of through war and atroc­ity.</p>
    <p>The ti­tle, Erasure, is partly word­play, but also al­ludes to global changes through the years that have “erased” mem­o­ries, cul­tures and en­tire na­tions. For ex­am­ple, one of the erasers used in the match has the flag of Yu­goslavia, a na­tion which no longer ex­ists.</p>
    <p>The tour­na­ment will fea­ture 16 teams in a knock­out format, us­ing flag erasers from the early 1990s.</p>
    <p>Sub­se­quently, these will be part of a gallery ex­hi­bi­tion at The Sub­sta­tion.</p>
