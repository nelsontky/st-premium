    <p>Women hop­ing to land a tech­nol­ogy job with DBS Bank can ap­ply on­line at a hir­ing fair as the Repub­lic’s largest bank seeks to en­cour­age more women here to build a ca­reer in tech.</p>
    <p>More than 50 va­can­cies are avail­able in 11 roles – in­clud­ing those of data en­gi­neers, scrum masters and full stack de­vel­op­ers – at DBS’ vir­tual ca­reer fair for women tech­nol­o­gists, the bank said yesterday.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­cants will go through an 80-minute on­line as­sess­ment for the roles they are ap­ply­ing for to gauge their tech­ni­cal and plan­ning ca­pa­bil­i­ties. The on­line as­sess­ments must be sub­mit­ted by next Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Short­listed can­di­dates will be in­vited to an on­line hir­ing day on Oct 31. They will learn more about the com­pany, in­clud­ing its ap­proach to gen­der di­ver­sity and what it is like to build a ca­reer as a fe­male tech­nol­o­gist at the bank. The next stage will be a vir­tual in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>DBS man­ag­ing direc­tor Soh Siew Choo said that women con­tinue to be un­der-rep­re­sented in the tech­nol­ogy space glob­ally.</p>
    <p>DBS wants to proac­tively ad­dress this by build­ing a pipe­line of women tech­nol­o­gists in Sin­ga­pore, said Ms Soh, who is also the bank’s head of con­sumer bank­ing and big data an­a­lyt­ics tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>“We have an op­por­tu­nity to lead by ex­am­ple and demon­strate what com­pa­nies can do to nur­ture a more gen­der-bal­anced tech­nol­ogy work­force,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing bal­anced gen­der rep­re­sen­ta­tion is also piv­otal to our on­go­ing dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion, as it al­lows us to tap di­verse ideas to de­velop dif­fer­en­ti­ated and ex­cep­tional ex­pe­ri­ences for our cus­tomers.”</p>
