    <p>HONG KONG • Deutsche Bank’s new chief ex­ec­u­tive for Asia will be based in Sin­ga­pore, pick­ing the city over Hong Kong at a volatile time for the Chi­nese ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>Mr Alexan­der von zur Muehlen, the new chief ex­ec­u­tive for Asi­aPa­cific, is re­lo­cat­ing from Frank­furt when he takes over the job at the start of next month, ac­cord­ing to a bank spokesman.</p>
    <p>His pre­de­ces­sor, Hong Kong­based Werner Stein­mueller, is re­tir­ing at the end of this month.</p>
    <p>Mr Kam­ran Khan, the bank’s new head of en­vi­ron­men­tal, so­cial and gov­er­nance for the re­gion, will also be based in Sin­ga­pore, mov­ing from the US.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion comes as Hong Kong is em­broiled in un­prece­dented po­lit­i­cal tur­bu­lence af­ter more than a year of anti-gov­ern­ment protests and is now in the cross hairs of a broader fight be­tween US and China.</p>
    <p>In an in­tense ri­valry with Sin­ga­pore, Hong Kong has long been a hub for Asian fi­nance, with nearly all of the ma­jor global banks, in­clud­ing Gold­man Sachs, JPMor­gan</p>
    <p>Chase and Cit­i­group, hav­ing their top re­gional ex­ec­u­tive in the city.</p>
    <p>This would be the first time in at least a decade for the Ger­man bank to put its sole Asia CEO out­side of Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>China last month passed a na­tional se­cu­rity law to rein in crit­i­cism of its rule in the city, rais­ing con­cerns its “one coun­try, two sys­tems” frame­work de­vised to main­tain its free­dom of ex­pres­sion, cap­i­tal­ist fi­nan­cial sys­tem and in­de­pen­dent ju­di­ciary will be un­der­mined.</p>
    <p>Granted, Deutsche Bank has placed its co-CEO for the re­gion in Sin­ga­pore. From 2012 to 2016, the Asian busi­ness was run by co-CEOs Alan Cloete and Gu­nit Chadha, who worked out of Hong Kong and Sin­ga­pore, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>The two were re­placed by Mr Stein­mueller in 2016, the first man­age­ment board mem­ber to be based in the fast-grow­ing re­gion, ac­cord­ing to the press re­lease.</p>
    <p>“We re­main com­mit­ted to our dual-hub struc­ture in Asia Pa­cific,” a Hong Kong-based spokesman for</p>
    <p>Deutsche Bank said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has been one of the ma­jor hubs for Deutsche Bank’s com­mer­cial bank­ing and fixed-in­come ser­vices, while its wealth man­age­ment, cor­po­rate fi­nance and as­set man­age­ment are pre­dom­i­nately staffed out of Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man bank is ex­it­ing its eq­ui­ties sales and trad­ing op­er­a­tions glob­ally.</p>
    <p>Deutsche Bank posted a €100 mil­lion (S$159 mil­lion) loss last year in Hong Kong, where it had 1,035 em­ploy­ees. In Sin­ga­pore, where it had 1,921 full-time staff, the bank posted a €102 mil­lion profit, ac­cord­ing to its an­nual re­port.</p>
    <p>Com­bined credit ex­po­sure i n China and Hong Kong amounted to €13.6 bil­lion, com­pared with €7.5 bil­lion in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mr Hel­man Si­to­hang at Credit Suisse and UBS’s Ed­mund Koh are the only Asia heads based in Sin­ga­pore among global banks.</p>
    <p>Bar­clays Asia head Jaideep Khanna is op­er­at­ing out of In­dia.</p>
    <p>Morgan Stan­ley co-Asia CEOs Gokul Laroia and Wei Chris­tian­son work out of Hong Kong and Bei­jing, re­spec­tively.</p>
