    <p>LISBON • Por­tu­gal may have a star-stud­ded at­tack­ing force of Cris­tiano Ron­aldo, J oao Felix, Bernardo Silva and Diogo Jota, but coach Fer­nando San­tos in­sisted they will not all be un­leashed from the start when his side host France in the Na­tions League to­day.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean cham­pi­ons, also the reign­ing Na­tions League win­ners, and Di­dier Deschamps’ side are tied on 10 points in Group 3 of League A with two matches left to play. Por­tu­gal are ahead on goal dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>The “fab four” did not start when Por­tu­gal beat An­dorra 7-0 in a friendly on Wed­nes­day, but all had some min­utes un­der their belts af­ter com­ing off the bench.</p>
    <p>“Only three of the four play, but I will not an­swer who will play,” San­tos told Por­tuguese broad­caster RTP.</p>
    <p>Both Ron­aldo and Felix (right) scored in the fi­nal 10 min­utes against An­dorra when they were in­tro­duced into the game.</p>
    <p>Ju­ven­tus for­ward Ron­aldo clinched his 102nd in­ter­na­tional goal and is now just seven shy of for­mer Iran striker Ali Daei’s record.</p>
    <p>Deschamps, mean­while, is count­ing on the re­turn of sev­eral in­jured play­ers when the world cham­pi­ons travel to the Es­ta­dio da Luz.</p>
    <p>Les Bleus were with­out Kylian Mbappe, Pres­nel Kim­pembe, Kings­ley Co­man, Ben­jamin Pavard and Lu­cas Her­nan­dez in a 2-0 friendly home loss to Fin­land on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“It’s go­ing in the right di­rec­tion,”</p>
    <p>Deschamps was quoted as say­ing by French sports daily L’Equipe on Thurs­day af­ter Fin­land ended their 12-match un­beaten streak.</p>
    <p>Deschamps added, how­ever, that he was “not sure of any­thing” con­cern­ing Mbappe and Pavard, who were out of the Fin­land game with a thigh prob­lem and an an­kle in­jury, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>France and Por­tu­gal played out a dull 0-0 draw at the Stade de France last month, with nei­ther team cre­at­ing any clear-cut scor­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>The French did not ad­vance to the knock­out stage of the Na­tions League in its in­au­gu­ral sea­son, af­ter they were beaten by the Nether­lands, who in turn lost 1-0 to Por­tu­gal in the fi­nal last year.</p>
