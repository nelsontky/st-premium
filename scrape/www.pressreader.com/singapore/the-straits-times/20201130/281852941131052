    <p>PARIS • Tens of thou­sands of peo­ple took to the streets across France on Satur­day to protest against a se­cu­rity Bill that would re­strict shar­ing of images of po­lice of­fi­cers and strengthen gov­ern­ment sur­veil­lance tools, the lat­est sign that anger over re­cent cases of po­lice vi­o­lence is gal­vanis­ing op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Me­dia or­gan­i­sa­tions and hu­man rights groups held ral­lies in dozens of cities, in­clud­ing Paris, Bordeaux and Lyon. All raised alarm over the new Bill, say­ing it could curb press free­dom and limit po­lice ac­count­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>“Rather than try­ing to solve prob­lems, this law seeks to cover up blun­ders,” said Mr Ni­co­las Gon­not, 50, a com­puter en­gi­neer who demon­strated in Paris.</p>
    <p>Ten­sions in France have been ris­ing over Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron’s se­cu­rity poli­cies, which op­po­nents say in­creas­ingly re­strict civil lib­er­ties. The fric­tions have grown in part in the wake of a string of Is­lamist ter­ror­ist at­tacks over the past few months.</p>
    <p>The demon­stra­tors con­sider the new se­cu­rity Bill a drift to­wards re­pres­sion in gov­ern­ment pol­icy and fur­ther ev­i­dence of the gov­ern­ment’s slide to the right.</p>
    <p>One of the Bill’s most dis­puted el­e­ments is a pro­vi­sion that would crim­i­nalise the broad­cast­ing of “the face or any other iden­ti­fy­ing el­e­ment” of on-duty po­lice of­fi­cers if the goal is to “phys­i­cally or men­tally harm” them.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment says the pro­vi­sion is meant to pro­tect po­lice from on­line abuses. But crit­ics say the word­ing is so open-ended it could dis­suade peo­ple from film­ing the po­lice and hold­ing them ac­count­able.</p>
    <p>An­other pro­vi­sion au­tho­rises the use of drones to film cit­i­zens in pub­lic and al­lows footage from body cam­eras worn by po­lice to be live-streamed to the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The Bill has brought wide­spread con­dem­na­tion from the French press, hu­man rights or­gan­i­sa­tions, and the coun­try’s defender of rights, an in­de­pen­dent om­buds­man which mon­i­tors civil and hu­man rights.</p>
    <p>The Bill, which the Lower House of Par­lia­ment passed last week, still needs to be con­sid­ered by the Se­nate, and the gov­ern­ment faces mount­ing pres­sure to re­write it.</p>
    <p>Mr Hugues Ren­son, a pow­er­ful law­maker in Mr Macron’s par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity, told news­pa­per Le Fi­garo: “When there is so much re­sis­tance to a mea­sure, it is some­times bet­ter to give it up than to per­sist.”</p>
    <p>In an­other sign that the gov­ern­ment could be pre­par­ing to back­track, Prime Min­is­ter Jean Cas­tex has said he will ap­point an in­de­pen­dent com­mis­sion to help re­draft the dis­puted pro­vi­sion on broad­cast­ing images of po­lice.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a press f reedom group de­nounced the “un­ac­cept­able” in­jury of an award-win­ning Syr­ian pho­to­jour­nal­ist dur­ing the week­end’s protests in Paris.</p>
    <p>Mr Ameer Al­halbi, 24, a free­lance pho­tog­ra­pher who worked for Polka Mag­a­zine and Agence France-Presse, was seen in photos with his face ap­pear­ing bruised and his head cov­ered in ban­dages.</p>
    <p>Re­porters Without Borders sec­re­tary-gen­eral Christophe Deloire tweeted that Mr Al­halbi had been wounded at Place de la Bastille by “a po­lice ba­ton” and con­demned the vi­o­lence. He added that the pho­tog­ra­pher had been clearly iden­ti­fied as a jour­nal­ist.</p>
    <p>Polka’s di­rec­tor of pho­tog­ra­phy Dim­itri Beck said Mr Al­halbi suf­fered a bro­ken nose and in­jured fore­head, and had been taken to hos­pi­tal.</p>
