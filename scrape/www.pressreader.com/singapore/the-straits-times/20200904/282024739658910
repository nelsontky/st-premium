    <p>This year’s Comex tech­nol­ogy show is be­ing held in a fully vir­tual for­mat for the first time, but will of­fer the same deep dis­counts as ex­hibitors take to Face­book Live to show­case their best deals for con­sumers.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, ma­jor elec­tron­ics re­tailer Best Denki kicked off the first live show at 8pm, gar­ner­ing around 7,000 views and 2,500 com­ments as of 9pm.</p>
    <p>Lim­ited-time deals for prod­ucts such as lap­tops, smart­phones and tele­vi­sion sets were an­nounced by em­cee Vic­to­ria Cheng live on the show, and later put up on Best Denki’s web­site.</p>
    <p>The re­tailer’s show oc­cu­pies the</p>
    <p>first slot of two sched­uled to be held daily on Comex’s Face­book page from yes­ter­day un­til Sept 13 by var­i­ous ex­hibitors. The other is at 9pm, and was helmed by iRobot yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Or­ders are placed in­di­vid­u­ally with each ex­hibitor, who will pro­vide fur­ther in­struc­tions for con­sumers dur­ing the show.</p>
    <p>Other ex­hibitors stag­ing live shows in­clude Sam­sung, Cre­ative, Courts and Harvey Nor­man.</p>
    <p>Comex, which drew around 500,000 vis­i­tors last year, is or­gan­ised by Sphere Ex­hibits, the events arm of Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings.</p>
    <p>Sphere Ex­hibits also or­gan­ises</p>
    <p>other con­sumer elec­tron­ics fairs such as the IT Show, the Tech Show and the Con­sumer Elec­tron­ics Ex­hi­bi­tion (CEE).</p>
    <p>Large-scale events this year such as con­sumer elec­tron­ics ex­hi­bi­tions have been hit hard by the Covid-19 out­break. Comex is the only one of Sphere Ex­hibits’ events to go on as planned.</p>
    <p>The IT Show, which was sup­posed to take place in March, has been post­poned twice this year ow­ing to safety con­cerns over Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The CEE, which was orig­i­nally slated for May, has been post­poned to next year.</p>
    <p>Sphere Ex­hibits busi­ness di­rec­tor Eric Ng said live stream­ing will be part of all of the com­pany’s events go­ing for­ward.</p>
    <p>“As we are still un­able to or­gan­ise a phys­i­cal event, we have de­cided to col­lab­o­rate with brands like Sam­sung, Sennheiser and many more to bring the best deals with prod­ucts up to 50 per cent off for the up­com­ing Face­book Live streams,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We thank all our part­ners for their sup­port and look for­ward to bring­ing the IT Show back next year.”</p>

    <p>MR ERIC NG,</p>
    <p>busi­ness di­rec­tor of Sphere Ex­hibits, which or­gan­ises Comex, not­ing that live stream­ing will be part of all of the com­pany’s events go­ing for­ward.</p>
