    <p>When we tell for­eign friends we live in Sin­ga­pore, the most com­mon re­sponse by far goes like this: “I love Sin­ga­pore, it’s so beau­ti­ful and clean!” They rave about our su­pertrees, our durian-in­spired theatre and the sci-fi ship sit­ting on top of the tow­ers.</p>
    <p>These re­sponses tell us of the world’s recog­ni­tion of Sin­ga­pore and its achieve­ments. They make us feel proud of Sin­ga­pore’s iden­tity and place in the world.</p>
    <p>At the of­fi­cial open­ing of Jewel Changi Air­port, Prime Min­is­ter</p>
    <p>Lee Hsien Loong said the com­plex “res­onates with Sin­ga­pore­ans, be­cause it re­minds us that when we dream big and ap­ply our­selves, noth­ing is im­pos­si­ble”.</p>
    <p>A big part of Sin­ga­pore’s na­tional iden­tity is in the sky­line, at­tached to our ar­chi­tec­tural icons, build­ings and in­fra­struc­ture. They are vis­ual tes­ta­ments of how Sin­ga­pore­ans have cre­ated a First World na­tion out of sheer grit and de­ter­mi­na­tion.</p>
    <p>But who ac­tu­ally built them?</p>
    <p>MISS­ING STO­RIES</p>
    <p>Iden­tity is a com­plex and evolv­ing thing, built on the sto­ries we tell our­selves. Dom­i­nant nar­ra­tives of the Sin­ga­pore story have of­ten left out a key group of peo­ple: nearly one mil­lion low-wage mi­grants who build, clean, main­tain and ren­o­vate the icons of our na­tional pride.</p>
    <p>As Sin­ga­pore en­tered into par­tial lock­down ear­lier this year, we</p>
    <p>tried to find some of these miss­ing pieces for a Lien Cen­tre for So­cial In­no­va­tion re­search project.</p>
    <p>We got to know Xin, a con­struc­tion worker from China who has been in Sin­ga­pore for 12 years – more than a decade of sep­a­ra­tion from his wife and chil­dren who had grown up with­out him. Chat­ting over What­sApp, we asked him about work. Know­ing noth­ing of con­struc­tion, we hoped he would tell us some­thing we could put a han­dle on, like brick­layer, welder or elec­tri­cian. He was none of them.</p>
    <p>Xin is a form­work car­pen­ter. He builds the moulds into which con­crete is poured and formed. In his words, he was the most ba­sic worker at the bot­tom of the hi­er­ar­chy. For oth­ers, there may be high-, mid­dle- and low-level work­ers, but for them, mi­grant work­ers on the work­site, “we’re all the same, just work­ers do­ing work”, he said. We were struck by his hu­mil­ity, and moved by what</p>
    <p>sounded like equal­ity in the trenches of con­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>His story tells us of a Sin­ga­pore where peo­ple are val­ued dif­fer­ently based on the work they do and how much they earn. This may be a fact of life, but a sad fact that need not de­fine our be­liefs. We know there is dig­nity in all work. More im­por­tantly, we know there is value in ev­ery per­son. Re­gard­less of the work a per­son does, he or she is a fa­ther, a mother, a son, a daugh­ter, who loves and is deeply loved by some­one else.</p>
    <p>At a per­sonal level, Xin’s story re­minded us of two dif­fer­ent peo­ple we knew whose paths had never crossed ex­cept in the uni­ver­sal­ity of their mi­gra­tion jour­neys.</p>
    <p>In the early years of the 20th cen­tury, Christy’s great-grand­mother sailed as a teenager from war-torn Europe to Amer­ica; in the 1930s, Qi­uyi’s grand­fa­ther es­caped the Chi­nese civil war and made it to Sin­ga­pore. Like Xin, they went in search of a</p>
    <p>bet­ter life and worked hard to raise their fam­i­lies. Christy’s great-grand­mother was a do­mes­tic helper, Qi­uyi’s grand­fa­ther was a labourer. Sep­a­rately, they were even­tu­ally given the op­por­tu­nity to call Amer­ica and Sin­ga­pore home, for­eign lands where their chil­dren, grand­chil­dren and great-grand­chil­dren thrived.</p>
    <p>This is an op­por­tu­nity Xin and oth­ers like him today do not have, no mat­ter how long they have worked here, how many homes they have kept, or how many build­ings they have built.</p>
    <p>CON­NECTED IN CRI­SIS</p>
    <p>Our en­counter with Xin and oth­ers like him high­light the long­stand­ing dis­con­nect be­tween us and them; and yet, Covid-19 has made a com­pelling per­sonal con­nec­tion. Res­i­dent or mi­grant, the health and well-be­ing of ev­ery­one are linked in a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The prob­lems con­fronting</p>
    <p>low-wage mi­grants are many and com­plex, and well doc­u­mented in re­search. But their vis­i­bil­ity is lim­ited to aca­demics and ad­vo­cates. The Lien Cen­tre re­port, Cri­sis And Con­nec­tion: Un­pack­ing Sin­ga­pore’s Mi­grant Worker Is­sues, is an at­tempt to bridge this in­for­ma­tion gap. We re­viewed the re­search out there and pro­duced a primer on what you need to know about Sin­ga­pore’s mi­grant work­ers and why it mat­ters.</p>
    <p>We do this work be­cause we be­lieve trans­for­ma­tive so­cial change starts with knowl­edge and un­der­stand­ing, that ev­i­dence-based insight can help us pause and chal­lenge sta­tus quo think­ing about how we man­age eco­nomic growth. It’s an idea of­ten cred­ited to Amer­i­can poet Maya An­gelou: When we know bet­ter, we can do bet­ter.</p>
    <p>BUILD BACK BET­TER</p>
    <p>As Covid-19 up­ends com­mu­ni­ties and economies around the world, we’ve heard calls to build back bet­ter.</p>
    <p>It’s a con­cept that first emerged af­ter the 2004 In­dian Ocean tsunami, that the pe­riod im­me­di­ately af­ter a cri­sis is a unique op­por­tu­nity for change that im­proves on pre-dis­as­ter con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment has sig­nalled its com­mit­ment to the welfare of mi­grant work­ers, pro­vid­ing free med­i­cal care for in­fected work­ers and pledg­ing to over­haul dor­mi­tory stan­dards. Both are signs that the Gov­ern­ment is tak­ing the lead and mak­ing struc­tural changes to im­prove work­ers’ pre-Covid con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>But a com­pre­hen­sive and sus­tained re­con­struc­tion is be­yond the Gov­ern­ment’s re­mit. It re­quires a fun­da­men­tal change in the way we see and un­der­stand low-wage mi­grants – in­deed, ev­ery­one – and the cru­cial work they do: do­mes­tic work, con­struc­tion, ser­vices, man­u­fac­tur­ing, ship­yards.</p>
    <p>Build­ing back bet­ter de­mands that we change the way our build­ings are con­structed so that we do a bet­ter job of pro­tect­ing work­ers at the bot­tom of the labour sup­ply chain. It de­mands that we ques­tion the dom­i­nant nar­ra­tives about the build­ings and in­fra­struc­ture that de­fine our coun­try and iden­tity.</p>
    <p>On In­ter­na­tional Mi­grants Day to­mor­row, we in­vite you to think about the “for­eign” worker as a per­son you might know. Con­sider our shared hu­man­ity; say hello, smile, or nod, what­ever you’re com­fort­able with. We in­vite you to be cu­ri­ous and won­der, what’s his or her story?</p>
    <p>Some of the ar­chi­tec­tural marvels they have worked on may sur­vive us and be­come mon­u­ments stud­ied by fu­ture his­to­ri­ans and an­thro­pol­o­gists – per­haps our chil­dren and grand­chil­dren – in­tent on telling the full story. What would that story say about Sin­ga­pore, its defin­ing val­ues as a peo­ple, and what it stands for as a na­tion?</p>
