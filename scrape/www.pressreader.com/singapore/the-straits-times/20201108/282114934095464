    <p>They used to be cabin crew with na­tional car­rier Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA). Now they are wealth plan­ning man­agers with DBS Bank.</p>
    <p>Want­ing to take their ca­reers in a dif­fer­ent di­rec­tion, Mr Gil­bert Tay, 36, and Ms Brinda Cheng, 30, joined the bank in April and Septem­ber re­spec­tively, drawn to the dy­namism of the fi­nan­cial ser­vices sec­tor and the abil­ity to help oth­ers meet their fi­nan­cial goals.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay, a for­mer lead­ing stew­ard with SIA for 13 years, says the acute sit­u­a­tional aware­ness he de­vel­oped while fly­ing has come in handy when build­ing rapport with cus­tomers at the DBS branch in Bis­han.</p>
    <p>It al­lows him to ob­serve cus­tomers walk­ing into the branch, an­tic­i­pate their needs and ap­proach them to of­fer as­sis­tance even be­fore they ask.</p>
    <p>“It is the same skill I used when man­ag­ing flights. In any in­dus­try built on re­la­tion­ships, first im­pres­sions count. And at DBS, just like on a flight, we are not given a sec­ond chance to make a good first im­pres­sion.”</p>
    <p>His in­ter­est in the fi­nance sec­tor de­vel­oped in the mid­dle of last year after he took some fi­nan­cial ex­am­i­na­tions.</p>
    <p>He says of his cur­rent role: “I think it is mean­ing­ful to be able to share the im­por­tance of wealth plan­ning with cus­tomers, and help them meet their fi­nan­cial plan­ning goals, re­gard­less of their back­ground.</p>
    <p>“I feel es­pe­cially ful­filled when they re­fer me to their friends, be­cause it shows I have de­vel­oped a re­la­tion­ship of trust with these cus­tomers.”</p>
    <p>For Ms Cheng, who has had two stints as an SIA cabin crew mem­ber – from 2012 to 2014, and 2018 to Au­gust this year – the per­son­alised ser­vice and com­mu­ni­ca­tion skills she picked up dur­ing her time with the car­rier al­lowed her to make the tran­si­tion to bank­ing.</p>
    <p>One les­son from her fly­ing days which she never for­gets is to al­ways be at­ten­tive to oth­ers’ needs as well as serve from the heart.</p>
    <p>She learnt t his on board a 14-hour red-eye flight from Sin­ga­pore to Lon­don, when an el­derly pas­sen­ger in her aisle re­fused food and drinks dur­ing the meal ser­vice.</p>
    <p>The crew were su­per busy on the full flight, she re­calls, and no­body paid par­tic­u­lar at­ten­tion to the woman at first.</p>
    <p>But once the lights were turned off, Ms Cheng checked on her to see if she was all right. The woman then re­vealed she was hun­gry and thirsty, but did not have any money to pay for food; her ticket was pur­chased by her son.</p>
    <p>Ms Cheng says: “The pas­sen­ger was un­aware that the food and drinks were in­cluded in her ticket price.”</p>
    <p>The crew im­me­di­ately served her a hot meal and en­sured she was well taken care of through­out the flight. Upon dis­em­barka­tion, the woman gave Ms Cheng a hug and thanked her for her care.</p>
    <p>“I will al­ways re­mem­ber how a sim­ple act of check­ing on some­one can lead to such a pos­i­tive out­come,” she adds.</p>
