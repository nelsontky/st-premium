    <p>SOFIA • With Harry Kane just eight goals be­hind Bobby Smith, he is odds-on to leapfrog him into sec­ond place on the all-time scor­ing list for Tot­ten­ham this sea­son.</p>
    <p>The Eng­land cap­tain reached the 200-goal mile­stone as Spurs won 3-1 at Bul­gar­ian side Lu­do­gorets i n their Europa League Group J tie on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Lu­cas Moura and Gio­vani lo Celso were the other scor­ers as the vis­i­tors moved to the top of their group on goal dif­fer­ence, with Bel­gium’s An­twerp and Aus­trian out­fit Lask all on six points. The hosts re­main bot­tom with no points.</p>
    <p>Once Kane passes Smith, only Eng­land great and 1966 World Cup win­ner Jimmy Greaves stands in his way as the club’s all-time scorer with 266 goals.</p>
    <p>His man­ager Jose Mourinho be­lieves it is just a mat­ter of time be­fore the 27-year-old striker makes up the 66-goal dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“The num­bers make him a club le­gend,” the Por­tuguese told BT Sport. “What he is achiev­ing is great for such a young guy.</p>
    <p>“It is just a ques­tion of time. One more month, one less month. It’s just a ques­tion of time.</p>
    <p>“We tried to kill the game from the start. A strong start, two good goals.</p>
    <p>“I al­ways ex­pect the max­i­mum so I’m al­ways de­mand­ing.</p>
    <p>“There are still things from this game I’m not happy with.”</p>
    <p>On his land­mark feat com­ing on his 300th ap­pear­ance for Spurs, Kane said: “It’s a great mile­stone to reach and hope­fully there are a few more to come.</p>
    <p>“Time goes so quick it feels like yes­ter­day I scored my first for Spurs. It’s a great achieve­ment but let’s keep them com­ing.”</p>
    <p>In Group B, north Lon­don ri­vals Arse­nal con­ceded first to Molde be­fore fight­ing back to beat their Nor­we­gian op­po­nents 4-1 at the Emi­rates.</p>
    <p>Two own goals, com­ing ei­ther side of the break, and strikes by Ni­co­las Pepe and Joe Wil­lock en­sured the Gunners kept up their 100 per cent record in Europe this sea­son.</p>
