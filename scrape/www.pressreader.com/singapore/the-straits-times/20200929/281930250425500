    <p>Se­nior man­age­ment at Sin­ga­pore’s six au­tonomous uni­ver­si­ties (AUs) have re­cently taken a pay cut in re­sponse to the ad­verse im­pact that Covid-19 has had on the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The in­sti­tu­tions have also stepped up fi­nan­cial re­lief in the past few months by en­cour­ag­ing do­na­tions and set­ting up funds for stu­dents af­fected by the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>An­swer­ing queries from The Straits Times, a spokesman for the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) said: “The AUs de­cided to ad­just down­wards the pay for their se­nior staff hold­ing lead­er­ship po­si­tions, in con­sul­ta­tion with MOE.”</p>
    <p>The min­istry and uni­ver­si­ties did not give any de­tails about the ex­tent of the pay re­duc­tion, whether it was a one-off ex­er­cise, and when it took place, say­ing that these are con­fi­den­tial.</p>
    <p>The spokesman said: “As pub­licly funded na­tional in­sti­tu­tions, the AUs play an im­por­tant na­tional role in ed­u­cat­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>“The AUs stand to­gether in sol­i­dar­ity with the rest of the na­tion dur­ing this dif­fi­cult pe­riod.”</p>
    <p>The move by the AUs fol­lows the Na­tional Wages Coun­cil’s rec­om­men­da­tion that em­ploy­ers ad­versely im­pacted by Covid-19 can con­sider re­duc­ing wages – and have their man­age­ment lead by ex­am­ple – to cut costs and save jobs.</p>
    <p>In the same vein, the public ser­vice has been ex­er­cis­ing wage re­straint, said the MOE spokesman.</p>
    <p>The Public Ser­vice Di­vi­sion an­nounced in June that public of­fi­cers in su­per­scale grades will take a one-time 0.5-month or onemonth pay cut in ac­cor­dance with their se­nior­ity.</p>
    <p>The uni­ver­si­ties have also en­sured that stu­dents re­ceive the fi­nan­cial sup­port they need dur­ing this re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) Stu­dents Sol­i­dar­ity Fund has raised about $1.6 mil­lion, and the univer­sity has dis­bursed grants rang­ing from $200 to $700 to some 3,100 stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, the Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity (NTU) has dis­trib­uted more than $1.6 mil­lion to over 1,100 stu­dents. They re­ceived sums rang­ing from $500 to $3,000, de­pend­ing on their in­di­vid­ual needs.</p>
    <p>A spokesman said that NTU has also launched a fund seeded by a per­sonal gift of $100,000 from its pres­i­dent Subra Suresh and his wife</p>
    <p>Mary. The NTU Pri­or­i­ties Fund has since grown to $1.7 mil­lion in size, thanks to the gen­eros­ity of more than 1,600 other donors, she said.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity (SMU) said the in­sti­tu­tion set up an SMU Re­silience Fund in May to help stu­dents fac­ing fi­nan­cial hard­ship be­cause of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The fund, which started with $2.5 mil­lion, has since grown by an­other $1.14 mil­lion, which in­cludes con­tri­bu­tions from fac­ulty and staff.</p>
    <p>The spokesman added that the univer­sity man­age­ment team has also pledged to con­trib­ute a pro­por­tion of their an­nual com­pen­sa­tion to sup­port stu­dents in need.</p>
    <p>Nearly 200 SMU stu­dents have re­ceived fi­nan­cial sup­port so far and it is ex­pected that close to 600 more stu­dents will re­ceive sup­port over the next month.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy and De­sign has set up an emer­gency fund, which has raised about $260,000 for stu­dents af­fected by the pan­demic. This is on top of ex­ist­ing gov­ern­ment bur­saries.</p>
    <p>A spokesman said about $149,000 has been dis­bursed to 54 stu­dents so far, who re­ceived sums rang­ing from $1,500 to $15,000, with the higher quan­tum go­ing to­wards cov­er­ing tu­ition fees in the cur­rent aca­demic year.</p>
    <p>NTU bio­engi­neer­ing un­der­grad­u­ate Wong Siaw Wen, 23, re­ceived $1,500 from the univer­sity’s Pri­or­i­ties Fund ear­lier this year, af­ter her fa­ther was forced to stop work as a sub­con­trac­tor in the con­struc­tion sec­tor in March. He re­sumed work last month.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong, a Malaysian whose mother is a house­wife, said her par­ents had to bor­row money from rel­a­tives to pay for their liv­ing ex­penses. “The help from NTU re­duced the bur­den on my fam­ily to sup­port me and I also have my own sav­ings,” she said.</p>
    <p>NUS third-year com­mu­ni­ca­tions and new me­dia stu­dent Jillian Chang, 21, re­ceived a $700 grant from the NUS Stu­dents Sol­i­dar­ity Fund, on top of other bur­saries.</p>
    <p>Her mother quit teach­ing last year due to poor health and is cur­rently not work­ing full time, while her fa­ther, who works in the en­gi­neer­ing sec­tor, had a pay cut.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 has made us a bit more cau­tious about spend­ing. We eat out less and try to plan ahead. I try not to be wor­ried,” said Ms Chang.</p>
