    <p>NEW YORK • Do­minic Thiem has cer­tainly paid his dues in the lon­grun­ning era of the “Big Three”.</p>
    <p>To­day, with world No. 1 No­vak Djokovic, sec­ond-ranked Rafael Nadal and 20-time Grand Slam cham­pion Roger Fed­erer all out of the pic­ture, the 27-year-old will get his next and best chance to win his first Grand Slam sin­gles ti­tle.</p>
    <p>He earned it on Fri­day with a 6-2, 7-6 (9-7), 7-6 (7-5) US Open semi-fi­nal vic­tory over Daniil Medvedev that was much more grind­ing and drain­ing than a nor­mal straight-set af­fair.</p>
    <p>“Def­i­nitely any­thing but,” Thiem said, with sweat drip­ping off his face and clothes dur­ing the post­match in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>The No. 2 seed from Aus­tria had to rally from a ser­vice break down in each of the fi­nal two sets against his un­pre­dictable Rus­sian op­po­nent and had to save a set point in the sec­ond-set tiebreaker.</p>
    <p>But, de­spite pain in his Achilles ten­don and two falls in the match, Thiem was the more bal­anced and re­li­able threat, and he will now face Alexan­der Zverev in to­day’s fi­nal.</p>
    <p>The win­ner will be the first new Grand Slam sin­gles cham­pion in the men’s game in six years.</p>
    <p>It will be the first Ma­jor fi­nal for Ger­man Zverev, 23, who has long been con­sid­ered a star in the mak­ing.</p>
    <p>For Thiem, who has lost the last two French Open fi­nals to Nadal and a taut five-set Aus­tralian Open fi­nal to Djokovic in Jan­uary, this will be his fourth Slam fi­nal.</p>
    <p>“If I win, I have my first,” the world No. 3 said. “If not, I prob­a­bly have to call Andy Mur­ray about how it is to be 0-4.”</p>
    <p>The Scot lost his first four Ma­jor fi­nals be­fore fi­nally win­ning the US Open in 2012.</p>
    <p>Thiem has beaten all three of the “Big Three” and Mur­ray on mul­ti­ple oc­ca­sions but, through­out his ca­reer, they have blocked his path at the Grand Slams.</p>
    <p>This time, he did not have to face any of them and will be the favourite against Zverev, who he has beaten seven times in nine matches, in­clud­ing all three of their du­els in the Ma­jors.</p>
    <p>“It’s all or noth­ing,” Thiem said. “The last one we had was an amaz­ing one in Aus­tralia: two tiebreaks for me, su­per, su­per close. And I guess the main thing I have to fo­cus on is to re­turn good.</p>
    <p>“His first serve is out of this world: so fast and so pre­cise. So just try to get that back in play. It’s a great friend­ship, a great ri­valry... I’m look­ing for­ward to play­ing that first Ma­jor fi­nal with him.”</p>
    <p>Zverev beat Spain’s Pablo Car­reno Busta 3-6, 2-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 in the first semi-fi­nal on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>It was the first time in his short ca­reer that he had won a match af­ter los­ing the first two sets.</p>
    <p>But what mat­tered most to the world No. 7 was tak­ing one more gi­ant step to­ward a Slam ti­tle.</p>
    <p>Thiem and Zverev, along with Medvedev and Ste­fanos Tsit­si­pas, are all in their 20s and have rightly been con­sid­ered the most likely can­di­dates to suc­ceed the “Big Three”.</p>
    <p>Zverev l ooked any­thing but likely to win on Fri­day in the early go­ing as he mist­imed ground­strokes, strug­gled to win quick points with his heavy serve, double-faulted into the net and spread his long arms wide, look­ing im­plor­ingly at mem­bers of his team in the sparsely pop­u­lated stands of the Arthur Ashe Sta­dium.</p>
    <p>“I was ac­tu­ally look­ing at the score­board when I was down two sets to love,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I was like, I can’t be­lieve it. I’m play­ing in a semi-fi­nal where I’m sup­posed to be the favourite, and I am down two sets to love, and I have no chance; I’m play­ing that bad.</p>
    <p>“So I knew I had to come up with bet­ter tennis and knew I had to be more sta­ble.”</p>
    <p>Eas­ier thought than done, but Zverev is used to work­ing his way out of trou­ble and, though he had never come all the way back be­fore from two sets down, he has proved him­self in five-set matches and is now 14-6 in them.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he will clearly need to play a much more com­plete match if he is to pose a se­ri­ous threat in the fi­nal.</p>
    <p>“I couldn’t be hap­pier,” Zverev said of his come­back. “But there’s still one step to go for me.”</p>
