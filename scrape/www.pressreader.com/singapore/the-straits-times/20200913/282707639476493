    <p>Ed­i­to­rial</p>
    <p>China Daily, China</p>
    <p>Al­though it is gen­er­ally be­lieved that nei­ther China nor In­dia wants the spo­radic spats be­tween their fron­tier troops to es­ca­late into a full-scale con­flict, In­dian sol­diers again crossed the Line of Ac­tual Con­trol last Mon­day and “threat­ened the Chi­nese bor­der de­fence pa­trol of­fi­cers”.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese De­fence Min­istry said it was a “grave mil­i­tary provo­ca­tion” and, ac­cord­ing to the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army West­ern The­atre Com­mand, the Chi­nese troops were forced to take cor­re­spond­ing coun­ter­mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent may not have been as wor­ry­ing had it not in­volved the fir­ing of weapons, al­beit re­port­edly into the air.</p>
    <p>It is par­tic­u­larly wor­ry­ing as the fir­ing of weapons breaks the con­sen­sus that the bor­der troops would not use any firearms should there be any com­ing to­gether.</p>
    <p>It is to be hoped this is an iso­lated in­ci­dent and does not her­ald blood­shed to come.</p>
    <p>En­cour­ag­ingly, de­ci­sion-mak­ers in both coun­tries seem in­tent on keep­ing a lid on the ten­sions.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry has re­peat­edly stated that China is com­mit­ted to bor­der peace and friendly re­la­tions with the coun­try’s key south­ern neigh­bour.</p>
    <p>In­dian For­eign Min­is­ter Subrah­manyam Jais­hankar said bor­der peace and tran­quil­lity are the foun­da­tion for the two na­tions’ re­la­tions, while call­ing for “very, very in-depth di­a­logue” at po­lit­i­cal lev­els to re­solve the bor­der sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Talks have been and are be­ing held at var­i­ous lev­els for the sin­gle pur­pose of pre­vent­ing po­ten­tial un­man­age­able es­ca­la­tion and spillover. And th­ese en­deav­ours have worked to some ex­tent, at least in terms of putting an im­me­di­ate brake on what might oth­er­wise have proved to be in­flammable emer­gen­cies.</p>
    <p>But the lat­est de­vel­op­ments in the China-In­dia bor­der ar­eas in­di­cate that as neg­a­tive feel­ings on both sides ac­cu­mu­late against the other, the risk of such seem­ingly in­signif­i­cant fric­tions trig­ger­ing more dam­ag­ing con­fronta­tions can­not be ruled out.</p>
    <p>The ris­ing na­tion­al­ism in In­dia may make any con­cil­ia­tory mes­sages dif­fi­cult to de­liver with­out seem­ing like ap­pease­ment.</p>
    <p>So while timely face-to-face com­mu­ni­ca­tion be­tween the com­man­ders of the bor­der forces is in­stru­men­tal to avoid­ing mis­un­der­stand­ing and mis­judg­ment on the ground, it is im­per­a­tive po­lit­i­cal lead­ers get in­volved to calm the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>China’s moves and In­dia’s vul­ner­a­bil­ity</p>
    <p>Vinod Saighal</p>
    <p>The States­man, In­dia</p>
    <p>On the night of Aug 29-30, In­dian com­man­ders de­cided to send in a bat­tal­ion to oc­cupy Black Top on the south­ern side of Pan­gong Tso on In­dia’s side of the Line of Ac­tual Con­trol, to pre-empt the Chi­nese from mov­ing in.</p>
    <p>Had the Chi­nese oc­cu­pied Black Top and the lo­cal com­man­ders waited for in­struc­tions, the Chi­nese would have firmed in.</p>
    <p>This would have been a pre­lude to 1962 all over again. It is felt that In­dia’s op­tions as of now re­main lim­ited to firm­ing in while en­sur­ing that China is not in a po­si­tion to sur­prise In­dia along the en­tire front.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the gov­ern­ment is tak­ing all mea­sures to bol­ster the armed forces in ev­ery way.</p>
    <p>Im­me­di­ate mil­i­tary op­tion be­fore the win­ter sets in is not an op­tion at this junc­ture. The army and the gov­ern­ment would have re­alised by now that putting the moun­tain strike on hold was a mis­take that has to be rec­ti­fied at the ear­li­est.</p>
    <p>With­out ri­poste ca­pa­bil­ity, no en­emy is ever de­terred.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping has painted him­self into a cor­ner in Ladakh. He knows that China can nei­ther af­ford a full-scale mil­i­tary ac­tion in Ladakh nor con­tinue with the sta­tus quo through­out the win­ter and be­yond.</p>
    <p>Mr Naren­dra Modi is in an equally</p>
    <p>dif­fi­cult po­si­tion. The virus shows no signs of abat­ing. The eco­nomic de­cline is no less worse.</p>
    <p>What can be said with a fair de­gree of cer­tainty is that the In­dian Prime Min­is­ter is in a much bet­ter po­si­tion than his coun­ter­part in Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Mr Modi is unas­sail­able till at least 2024. His party en­joys an</p>
    <p>over­whelm­ing ma­jor­ity. His pop­u­lar­ity re­mains very high.</p>
    <p>His gov­ern­ment has to re­alise that In­dia’s vul­ner­a­bil­ity in Ladakh will re­main till man­u­fac­tur­ing speeds up, be­cause China man­u­fac­tures all its weapons plat­forms in the coun­try, shed­ding its re­liance on Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>De-es­ca­la­tion the only real op­tion</p>
    <p>Vi­jay Kant Karna</p>
    <p>The Kath­mandu Post, Nepal</p>
    <p>In­dia and China have a his­tory of bor­der con­flict. The last Sino-In­dian clash be­fore this year was in 2017 in the Dok­lam re­gion.</p>
    <p>It was a three-month stand-off be­tween the two armies.</p>
    <p>The most re­cent mil­i­tary con­fronta­tion was wit­nessed in the Gal­wan Val­ley in June.</p>
    <p>The face-off was, how­ever, not the end of the con­flict.</p>
    <p>China re­port­edly moved in 20 mar­tial arts train­ers to the Ti­betan plateau to train its forces, three weeks af­ter the clash. The mar­tial arts fight­ers have been em­ployed to help with bor­der pa­trol and spe­cial forces.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts have raised con­cerns over whether there is an ul­ti­mate agenda that China as­pires to achieve or if the face-off was linked to its be­hav­iour else­where.</p>
    <p>For­eign af­fairs ex­perts and China watch­ers be­lieve that the con­flict in the Gal­wan Val­ley was an­tic­i­pated and cal­cu­lated if viewed in the light of China’s over­all in­ter­na­tional per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>China’s global stand­ing took a se­vere hit with the Covid-19 out­break and a wide­spread per­cep­tion that it failed to curb the virus. As it spread world­wide, claim­ing sev­eral lives, the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity has been com­pelled to ques­tion China’s role.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the stand-off, which sparked anti-China and hy­per-na­tion­al­ist sen­ti­ments in In­dia, the In­di­ans de­cided to boy­cott Chi­nese goods and apps, and burned the flag as well.</p>
    <p>The Gal­wan Val­ley gets its name from the Gal­wan River, which orig­i­nates in the Ak­sai Chin re­gion and joins the Shyok River. It is lo­cated in east­ern Ladakh and is a vi­tal road link to Daulat Beg Oldi, the world’s high­est land­ing ground next to the Line of Ac­tual Con­trol.</p>
    <p>The Gal­wan Val­ley is con­sid­ered strate­gic for both coun­tries. The river is the high­est ridge line that al­lows China to con­trol the Shyok route passes, which are close to the river. The coun­try wants to con­trol the area as it fears that In­dia could end up threat­en­ing its po­si­tion in Ak­sai Chin by us­ing the Gal­wan River val­ley to its ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, China is very op­posed to In­dia con­struct­ing any tent or in­fra­struc­ture in the area.</p>
    <p>On July 10, In­dia and China held yet an­other round of talks. They re­viewed the progress made in the on­go­ing dis­en­gage­ment process and agreed on “over­all de­vel­op­ment” of bi­lat­eral ties.</p>
    <p>Dis­en­gage­ment and de-es­ca­la­tion are the only op­tions for China and In­dia, for the in­ter­est of both coun­tries’ peace and de­vel­op­ment. me­dia part­ner Asia News Net­work, a group­ing of 24 news me­dia ti­tles.</p>
