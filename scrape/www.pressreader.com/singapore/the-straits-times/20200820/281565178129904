    <p>A re­cent ar­ti­cle in a lo­cal med­i­cal jour­nal say­ing Covid-19 is not more deadly for older peo­ple than other res­pi­ra­tory dis­eases has sparked some dis­cus­sion. How should peo­ple as­sess the risks to the el­derly, se­nior health cor­re­spon­dent Salma Kha­lik (below) asks ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Older peo­ple struck by Covid-19 are at higher risk of dy­ing than oth­ers. That is a fact which no one dis­putes.</p>
    <p>But what the ex­perts don’t quite agree on is just how high the risk is and what should be done about it.</p>
    <p>Un­der­stand­ing this de­bate in more de­tail can help in­di­vid­u­als and fam­i­lies make bet­ter de­ci­sions on how to pro­tect their el­derly.</p>
    <p>In one camp are views like those of Pro­fes­sor Lim Tow Keang, a se­nior res­pi­ra­tory and crit­i­cal care con­sul­tant at the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity Hospi­tal (NUH). He said Covid-19 is not any more deadly for older peo­ple than other res­pi­ra­tory ill­nesses.</p>
    <p>Prof Lim warned against over­pro­tect­ing the el­derly by re­strict­ing their move­ments dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Keep­ing them ‘safe’ through strict iso­la­tion in an ex­tended lock­down while the rest of so­ci­ety re­turns to nor­mal life could be viewed as an­other ver­sion of ageism that needs to be guarded against,” he said in an edi­to­rial in the lat­est is­sue of the An­nals, the pub­li­ca­tion of the Acad­emy of Medicine.</p>
    <p>Prof Lim said that while old age is a piv­otal risk fac­tor for mor­tal­ity in res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tions, it is not unique to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>He wrote: “Most re­ports of Covid-19, es­pe­cially in the me­dia, had de­scribed it as a deadly res­pi­ra­tory tract in­fec­tion with the as­sump­tion of a high case fa­tal­ity rate.</p>
    <p>“This is a fal­lacy which might lead, in cer­tain sit­u­a­tions, to in­ap­pro­pri­ate re­ac­tions, de­ci­sions and ac­tions.”</p>
    <p>The edi­to­rial states that while Covid-19 kills 10 times more in­fected peo­ple than in­fluenza – lead­ing to about 1 per cent of its pa­tients dy­ing com­pared with 0.1 per cent – com­mu­nity ac­quired pneu­mo­nia, which kills about 13 per cent of those in­fected, is far more deadly.</p>
    <p>So in terms of risk for older peo­ple, Covid-19 is some­where be­tween the flu and pneu­mo­nia.</p>
    <p>But Prof Lim also pointed out that while fairly com­mon, com­mu­nity ac­quired pneu­mo­nia is not a public health prob­lem since it does not spread eas­ily.</p>
    <p>He also ques­tioned the mor­tal­ity rate of Covid-19, given that many in­fected peo­ple re­main asymp­tomatic – which is un­usual for a res­pi­ra­tory dis­ease.</p>
    <p>He said that Covid-19’s mor­tal­ity rate may be lower than re­ported as the num­ber of peo­ple who have had the dis­ease is likely to be far higher than ac­knowl­edged.</p>
    <p>As more ev­i­dence sur­face, Prof Lim said the R0 or trans­mis­sion rate for Covid-19 is prob­a­bly dou­ble the two, three the world had been work­ing with. He thinks it is more likely that one in­fected per­son passes the virus to five, six oth­ers.</p>
    <p>He said: “One not only fails to con­sider the to­tal num­ber of in­fected in­di­vid­u­als in those com­mu­ni­ties, but also fails to ap­pre­ci­ate the real de­nom­i­na­tors of so many deaths for an ac­cu­rate as­sess­ment of how truly lethal Covid-19 is.”</p>
    <p>Prof Lim said the daily re­ports of in­fec­tions and deaths make Covid-19 ap­pear “a deadly dis­ease”. But Covid-19 fa­tal­i­ties “form just the tip of an ice­berg that com­prises a huge num­ber of mild cases below the sur­face of de­tec­tion”.</p>
    <p>Given all this, he said: “There is con­tin­uum of risks and ap­pro­pri­ate re­sponses. There are also more ef­fec­tive ways of pro­tect­ing older peo­ple than im­mo­bil­i­sa­tion.”</p>
    <p>One such way is pro­tect­ing nurs­ing homes, which Sin­ga­pore is do­ing. He pointed out that more than half the deaths in Europe and the United States com­prised nurs­ing home res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>This will not af­fect older peo­ple who are fit and in good health, he said, though he ad­vised cau­tion among the el­derly “against all types of res­pi­ra­tory tract in­fec­tions”.</p>
    <p>OTHER VIEWS</p>
    <p>How­ever, sev­eral in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­perts took is­sue with his com­ments.</p>
    <p>Dr Asok Ku­rup, a spe­cial­ist in pri­vate prac­tice who chairs the Acad­emy’s Chap­ter of In­fec­tious Dis­ease Physi­cians, said it is “fool­hardy” to draw con­clu­sions while the pan­demic is still rag­ing.</p>
    <p>He said: “I don’t think any­one has the an­swer yet to con­clude that it’s not more dan­ger­ous than other res­pi­ra­tory dis­eases in older per­sons.</p>
    <p>“It’s pre­ma­ture to com­pare case fa­tal­ity risk with other dis­ease con­di­tions as the pan­demic is still evolv­ing.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has also adopted a cal­i­brated ap­proach to deal with the pan­demic and has not im­mo­bilised or locked away its el­derly. In­stead, it has in­sti­tuted long-term, so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures that re­quire every­one to wear face masks out­side the home, and that ban so­cial mix­ing be­tween large groups, whether it is in pri­vate homes, res­tau­rants or public places like parks.</p>
    <p>As As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Hsu Li Yang, an in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­pert at the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, pointed out: “We aren’t quite lock­ing away our el­derly, at least not far more than the rest of the pop­u­la­tion.”</p>
    <p>But he added that age is cur­rently the “strong­est risk for mor­tal­ity”, al­though younger peo­ple with heart or lung prob­lems are also at higher risk. “I think every­one needs to con­tinue to take care, be­cause young, so­cia­ble and more mo­bile peo­ple clearly spread the virus bet­ter than the el­derly and in­firm.”</p>
    <p>Still, he ac­knowl­edged: “Un­for­tu­nately the el­derly are at far higher risk of dy­ing from Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher, a se­nior in­fec­tious dis­eases con­sul­tant at the NUH, said: “In­deed the el­derly are at risk of many forms of pneu­mo­nia, but Covid-19 is dif­fer­ent and these times are dif­fer­ent.”</p>
    <p>While he agreed with Prof Lim that “the el­derly should not be specif­i­cally locked down”, he said “they would be wise to ad­here to what we know can be pro­tec­tive; that is so­cial dis­tanc­ing, mask wear­ing, min­imis­ing vis­i­tors, un­nec­es­sary out­ings and hand hy­giene”.</p>
    <p>BAL­ANCED VIEW</p>
    <p>In a sense, de­spite their dis­agree­ments, the ex­perts all made valid points. Over-pro­tect­ing the el­derly may ac­tu­ally do them more harm as so­cial iso­la­tion could af­fect both their men­tal and phys­i­cal well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>But those who were so­cially ac­tive in the pre-Covid days need to re­alise that re­sum­ing such a life­style could place them at risk.</p>
    <p>Al­though the num­ber of in­fec­tions in the com­mu­nity av­er­ages about two a day – which is ex­tremely low given a lo­cal pop­u­la­tion of 3.8 mil­lion – it does in­di­cate that trans­mis­sion is still hap­pen­ing.</p>
    <p>It means that there are undis­cov­ered reser­voirs of the virus.</p>
    <p>Prof Hsu said that while the com­mu­nity cases here are now low, the ex­pe­ri­ences of Aus­tralia, Ja­pan and Viet­nam “serve as sober­ing re­minders that things can re­verse quickly”.</p>
    <p>Stud­ies show just how much more dan­ger­ous the virus can be for the el­derly. A Ger­man study of more than 10,000 Covid-19 pa­tients ad­mit­ted to 920 hos­pi­tals, which ap­peared on­line in The Lancet jour­nal on July 28, found that mor­tal­ity was sig­nif­i­cantly higher for older pa­tients.</p>
    <p>The study con­cluded: “In the Ger­man health­care sys­tem, in which hospi­tal ca­pac­i­ties have not been over­whelmed by the Covid-19 pan­demic, mor­tal­ity has been high for pa­tients re­ceiv­ing me­chan­i­cal ven­ti­la­tion, par­tic­u­larly for pa­tients aged 80 years or older and those re­quir­ing dial­y­sis, and has been con­sid­er­ably lower for pa­tients younger than 60 years.”</p>
    <p>For the 1,727 pa­tients who needed ven­ti­la­tor aid, 28 per cent of those 59 years and younger, died. Among older pa­tients, mor­tal­ity ranged from 45 per cent for those aged 60 to 69 years to 72 per cent for pa­tients 80 years and older.</p>
    <p>Age wasn’t the only de­ter­min­ing fac­tor. Pa­tients with se­ri­ous un­der­ly­ing med­i­cal con­di­tions, such as kid­ney fail­ure re­quir­ing dial­y­sis, also faced higher risk of death.</p>
    <p>So while there may be no need for the el­derly to con­tinue to lock them­selves away, they need to take more pre­cau­tions than younger peo­ple. And so must their fam­ily mem­bers who may pass the virus to them.</p>
    <p>Call it ageism if you want, the virus doesn’t care.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple must as­sess their own risks, de­cide on the risks they are will­ing to ac­cept, and act ac­cord­ingly.</p>
