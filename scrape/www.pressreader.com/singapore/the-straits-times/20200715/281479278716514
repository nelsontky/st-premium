    <p>The United States has for­mally re­jected most of China’s claims to the South China Sea, is­su­ing a state­ment that backed an in­ter­na­tional ar­bi­tral tri­bunal’s rul­ing in 2016 that they are il­le­gal.</p>
    <p>“Bei­jing’s claims to off­shore re­sources across most of the South China Sea are com­pletely un­law­ful, as is its cam­paign of bul­ly­ing to con­trol them,” said Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>China re­sponded al­most im­me­di­ately, with the em­bassy here say­ing it firmly op­posed the state­ment. An em­bassy spokesman said the US had de­lib­er­ately dis­torted the facts and in­ter­na­tional law, ex­ag­ger­ated the sit­u­a­tion in the re­gion, and at­tempted to sow dis­cord be­tween China and other coastal states in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>“The US is not a coun­try di­rectly in­volved in the dis­putes. How­ever, it has kept in­ter­fer­ing in the issue,” said the spokesman in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“We ad­vise the US side to earnestly hon­our its com­mit­ment of not tak­ing sides on the issue of ter­ri­to­rial sovereignt­y, re­spect re­gional coun­tries’ ef­forts for a peace­ful and sta­ble South China Sea and stop its at­tempts to dis­rupt and sab­o­tage re­gional peace and sta­bil­ity.”</p>
    <p>In his state­ment, Mr Pom­peo said the US was align­ing its po­si­tion with the tri­bunal’s 2016 de­ci­sion, which re­jected China’s mar­itime claims as hav­ing no ba­sis in in­ter­na­tional law.</p>
    <p>China claims a large swathe of the South China Sea within its “ninedash line”, in­clud­ing wa­ters and mar­itime en­ti­tle­ments within the exclusive eco­nomic zones of other coastal states like Malaysia, In­done­sia, Viet­nam and the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>Those claims were re­jected four years ago by the in­ter­na­tional ar­bi­tral tri­bunal con­sti­tuted un­der the United Na­tions Con­ven­tion on the Law of the Sea, in a case brought by the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>While Wash­ing­ton has ob­jected to China’s claims be­fore, send­ing navy ships to the con­tested wa­ters for free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion op­er­a­tions, an­a­lysts said Mon­day’s state­ment is the first time the US has defini­tively re­jected the claims.</p>
    <p>In the state­ment, Mr Pom­peo ex­plic­itly sided with South-east Asian na­tions. “Amer­ica stands with our South-east Asian al­lies and part­ners in pro­tect­ing their sov­er­eign rights to off­shore re­sources, con­sis­tent with their rights and obli­ga­tions un­der in­ter­na­tional law.</p>
    <p>“We stand with the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity in de­fence of free­dom of the seas... and re­ject any push to im­pose ‘might makes right’ in the South China Sea or the wider re­gion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian said at a me­dia brief­ing that China “never seeks to es­tab­lish a mar­itime em­pire in the South China Sea”. He added that it “al­ways treats the neigh­bour­ing coun­tries of the South China Sea as equals, and al­ways main­tains the ut­most re­straint in safe­guard­ing the sovereignt­y and rights of the South China Sea”.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhao said China is com­mit­ted to work­ing with Asean coun­tries to main­tain peace and sta­bil­ity in the South China Sea, and that they are ne­go­ti­at­ing a more bind­ing Code of Con­duct in the wa­ter­way to jointly safe­guard peace and sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>But US As­sis­tant Sec­re­tary of State for East Asian and Pa­cific Af­fairs David Stil­well said there were “clear red flags” about Bei­jing’s aims in talks on the Code of Con­duct. Speak­ing at a we­bi­nar or­gan­ised by the Cen­tre for Strate­gic and In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies, he said that be­hind closed doors, Bei­jing had pushed Asean states to ac­cept lim­its on core mat­ters of na­tional in­ter­ests, in­clud­ing who they can part­ner with for mil­i­tary ex­er­cises and off­shore drilling, and di­lute their ref­er­ences to in­ter­na­tional law.</p>
