    <p>To hear Bran­don Ooi talk about speed is to lis­ten to a man in a trance. Fast is his busi­ness, his ad­dic­tion, his route to win­ning. Fast is sprint­ing through the wa­ter in a kayak quicker than he can run over long dis­tances. Fast is his up­per body slightly re­laxed, his legs and abs work­ing hard and his breath­ing even. Fast is the wind wash­ing his face as he searches for ef­fi­ciency.</p>
    <p>But there’s one slight prob­lem. Bran­don Ooi some­times slows him­self down. Not his speed, but his progress.</p>
    <p>He has gold, sil­ver, bronze from the SEA Games and a fourth place at the Asian Games, but he also has a disease. He some­times wants to win, and to be fast, too much. “My com­pet­i­tive­ness,” he says, “which I thought would only be a good thing, is also hold­ing me back.”</p>
    <p>Ooi, a 26-year-old pi­ano player, is a study in in­ten­sity and speaks hard truths in long sen­tences. One of them – and it’s the tough­est part of sport for him – is that he’s con­stantly com­par­ing him­self to the men in the next lanes.</p>
    <p>What are they go­ing to do? How do I beat these guys?</p>
    <p>Com­par­i­son is in­stinc­tive to ath­letes, who con­stantly mea­sure rank­ings, speeds, stats, physiques. In July, the great Se­bas­tian Coe told the Guardian a ter­rific tale about com­pet­i­tive­ness. On a cold Christ­mas day in 1979 he’d run 21km up­hill, had lunch, and then it struck him that his ri­val Steve Ovett was pos­si­bly still train­ing. “So com­pul­sively, I went up­stairs, put my kit on, ran an­other five miles.”</p>
    <p>But there’s a point – es­pe­cially be­fore a race – when com­par­i­son starts to play havoc with con­cen­tra­tion, when in­stead of be­ing in­spired by a ri­val it turns into in­ter­fer­ence. The more mind games Ooi plays, the more he de­vi­ates from his task.</p>
    <p>“I do the worst,” says Ooi, “when I’m sup­posed to beat one ri­val but there’s also an­other com­peti­tor I can beat.” He looks left, then right, plan­ning how to out­wit one, think­ing how to over­come the other. In­stead of clar­ity he has clut­ter. One race be­comes too many con­tests.</p>
    <p>“I shouldn’t be re­ly­ing on what peo­ple do and how oth­ers will race,” he says. Some kayak­ers in a 500m race might start fast, oth­ers con­ser­va­tively, but in­stead of stick­ing to his plan he’s jug­gling tac­tics. “I am try­ing to man­age so many ideas and it can back­fire.”</p>
    <p>At the 2015 Asian Olympic qual­i­fiers he’s in the fi­nal, feel­ing strong but then he “self-de­structs”. He thinks, “This guy is faster than me, so how do I squeeze some­thing more out of my­self. How do I get an edge over him? And there’s an­other guy, who I am sup­posed to beat, and so how do I get the edge over him?”</p>
    <p>The end re­sult was this: “I sprinted at the start, try­ing to be too smart, and I lost to even the peo­ple I was sup­posed to beat.”</p>
    <p>Ooi will burn you with his hon­esty, will look you in the eye and re­cite his er­rors and you have to mar­vel at ath­letes like him, at their truth-telling, at their will­ing­ness to re­flect on a weak­ness, own it, fix it. And Ooi knows where all this comes from, from his youth, from an am­bi­tion that was en­graved into his DNA. “I had, and still have, this ide­al­ism that I can do any­thing I want to do if I set my mind to it. I have to win no mat­ter what.”</p>
    <p>We can’t hear the ath­lete’s ur­gent voice, but Ooi’s told him he had to win ev­ery­where, against ev­ery­body, all the time. Even in prac­tice. He has to win, he tells him­self, be­cause he’s the only one train­ing full-time, be­cause he has the most ex­pe­ri­ence, be­cause he has strong of­fi­cial sup­port. And be­cause “my rice bowl de­pends on it”.</p>
    <p>Com­pet­i­tive­ness at the up­per end of the scale is the clos­est thing to be­ing pos­sessed. Ooi ex­hales it and he doesn’t need to tone it down, just re­di­rect it. “I’m too re­liant on en­ergy from ex­ter­nal re­sources,” he ad­mits and now he’s taken a wrench to his at­ti­tude. Just turn­ing his fo­cus, just ad­just­ing his tac­tics, just us­ing his en­ergy in a less dis­tract­ing way.</p>
    <p>Lis­ten­ing to him is fas­ci­nat­ing for this is a com­peti­tor slightly re­ar­rang­ing the route of his pur­suit. There’s no one man­ual on win­ning and so he has to find what works for him. As Ooi says: “My best races have al­ways been when I fo­cus on my­self.”</p>
    <p>His ri­val now is the man in the mir­ror, his com­pe­ti­tion is with dig­its. “I’m al­low­ing my­self to fo­cus on the num­bers churned out by the watch. It’s a good start­ing point. I need to beat my­self.” His speed, his heart rate, his power, learn­ing what his body can do, all this he can con­trol. Other ath­letes he can’t.</p>
    <p>He’s al­ways go­ing to be aware of the next man, but he’s more in­tent on break­ing him­self down. “I am try­ing to move to­wards be­ing more in tune with what I feel on wa­ter. I’m do­ing video anal­y­sis of my­self, try­ing to un­der­stand what I do and whether it matches what I see.” The finest races are al­ways with the self.</p>
    <p>Ooi is look­ing to raise his top speed. He’s look­ing at the Olympics next year and at a medal at the 2022 Asian Games. But mostly he’s look­ing straight, not right, not left, but down the 200m of his liq­uid lane. He’s still a work in grad­ual progress but you know he’s so dogged he’ll get there. Steadily he’s chang­ing the way he goes fast.</p>
    <p>My best races have al­ways been when I fo­cus on my­self.</p>
    <p>BRAN­DON OOI, na­tional kayaker, on his ideal mind­set go­ing into com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
