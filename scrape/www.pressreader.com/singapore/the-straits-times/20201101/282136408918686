    <p>Bo­rat uses the flower bed in front of the Trump In­ter­na­tional Ho­tel at New York City’s Colum­bus Cir­cle as a men’s room.</p>
    <p>Sacha Baron Co­hen plays the cello and is plan­ning to take some Zoom classes from the masters.</p>
    <p>Bo­rat keeps his teenage daugh­ter in a cage. (“Is it nicer than Me­la­nia’s cage?” she won­ders.) And when he takes her clothes shop­ping, he asks the sales­woman to direct them to the “No means Yes sec­tion”.</p>
    <p>Sacha Baron Co­hen, who once dreamed of be­ing a chef, loves to cook for his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Bo­rat buys a choco­late cake and asks the woman be­hind the counter to write “Jews will not re­place us” in ic­ing – with a smi­ley face.</p>
    <p>Sacha Baron Co­hen is an ob­ser­vant Jew who speaks</p>
    <p>He­brew and works with the Anti-Defama­tion League on “Stop Hate for Profit”, a cam­paign to stem the bile on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Bo­rat sings a ditty about the Wuhan flu and chop­ping up jour­nal­ists “like the Saudis do”.</p>
    <p>Sacha Baron Co­hen is Zoom­ing in for an in­ter­view, sport­ing a black base­ball cap, a black T-shirt and a Covid-o’clock shadow.</p>
    <p>We talk for two hours about ev­ery­thing from his ri­otous Bo­rat se­quel to how he fell in love with his wife, the flame-haired ac­tress Isla Fisher, to how he pre­pared to play Ab­bie Hoff­man in Aaron Sorkin’s new Net­flix movie, The Trial Of The Chicago 7, to how he de­cided to call out Mark Zucker­berg and “the Sil­i­con Six”.</p>
    <p>If you thought the co­me­dian could never do any­thing wilder than get­ting Dick Cheney to sign a wa­ter­board­ing kit for him in his 2018 Show­time se­ries, Who Is Amer­ica?, you would be wrong.</p>
    <p>There is a scene with a top ad­viser to Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump in Bo­rat Sub­se­quent Moviefilm: De­liv­ery Of Prodi­gious Bribe To Amer­i­can Regime For Make Ben­e­fit Once Glo­ri­ous Na­tion Of Kaza­khstan, now stream­ing on Ama­zon, that will leave you gob­s­macked.</p>
    <p>They say Trump has de­stroyed satire. But Baron Co­hen proves that is not so.</p>
    <p>I’ve been fol­low­ing his work, and pes­ter­ing him for an in­ter­view, ever since he first hit Amer­ica, mas­querad­ing as Ali G, a wannabe Bri­tish rap­per, and scam­ming un­sus­pect­ing dig­ni­taries into in­ter­views.</p>
    <p>He quizzed a puz­zled James Baker III about why he used a sys­tem of car­rots and sticks in in­ter­na­tional diplo­macy. What if a coun­try didn’t like car­rots? What if its in­hab­i­tants pre­ferred a dif­fer­ent veg­etable?</p>
    <p>In 2003, Ali G pitched Trump about in­vest­ing in an ice cream glove that would pre­vent your hand from get­ting sticky.</p>
    <p>Trump, who walked out of the in­ter­view in dis­gust, told me later: “I thought he was se­ri­ously re­tarded. It was a to­tal con job. But my daugh­ter Ivanka saw it and thought it was very cool.”</p>
    <p>Baron Co­hen, who just turned</p>
    <p>49, said: “Ob­vi­ously, I’ve re­alised that I’ve had a long-stand­ing dis­taste for the pres­i­dent. That was why I wanted to in­ter­view him as Ali G.”</p>
    <p>He added: “His bril­liance was to com­man­deer the very term that was be­ing used against him, ‘fake news’, and use it against ev­ery jour­nal­ist that had jour­nal­is­tic in­tegrity.”</p>
    <p>The prankster has no prob­lem sprint­ing out of a lux­ury ho­tel in New York and run­ning down the street in lacy pink lin­gerie. But out of char­ac­ter, he’s very pri­vate, even a bit shy.</p>
    <p>He re­fused for many years to give in­ter­views as him­self. He would oc­ca­sion­ally speak as his char­ac­ters. He tended to let cri­tiques pass with­out re­but­tal, as when jour­nal­ists won­dered if Ali G was in the tra­di­tion of Al Jol­son and when Abe Fox­man, the for­mer di­rec­tor of the Anti-Defama­tion League (ADL), crit­i­cised Bo­rat, fear­ing the char­ac­ter could in­cite anti-Semitism be­cause some peo­ple might miss the irony.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the white na­tion­al­ist rally in Char­lottesvill­e, Vir­ginia, an ap­palled Baron Co­hen reached out to Jonathan Green­blatt, the di­rec­tor of the ADL, who per­suaded the star to give the key­note at last year’s ADL con­fer­ence, Never Is Now.</p>
    <p>“I was just so im­pressed by his in­tel­li­gence,” Green­blatt said. “Th­ese is­sues are at the heart of his mo­tive for his unique style of art. More than any­one in pub­lic life to­day, he ex­poses bias – whether it’s anti-Semitism, ho­mo­pho­bia or rank racism – for what it is, shame­ful and wrench­ing and ig­no­rant.” (In fact, Baron Co­hen used He­brew and some Pol­ish as a stand-in for the Kazakh lan­guage in Bo­rat.)</p>
    <p>The ac­tor started his speech by say­ing that, to be clear: “When I say ‘racism, hate and big­otry’, I’m not re­fer­ring to the names of (Trump ad­viser) Stephen Miller’s Labradoo­dles.”</p>
    <p>Later he noted that while his stunts could be “ju­ve­nile” and “puerile”, at least some were aimed at get­ting peo­ple to re­veal what they be­lieved, as “when Bo­rat was able to get an en­tire bar in Ari­zona to sing ‘Throw the Jew down the well’, it did re­veal peo­ple’s in­dif­fer­ence to anti-Semitism”.</p>
    <p>Scorch­ing the lords of the cloud, he said that Face­book would run and mi­cro-tar­get any “po­lit­i­cal” ad­ver­tise­ment any­one wanted, even if it was a lie. “If Face­book were around in the 1930s,” he said, “it would have al­lowed Hitler to post 30-sec­ond ads on his ‘so­lu­tion’ to the ‘Jewish prob­lem’.”</p>
    <p>The speech catal­ysed the “Stop Hate for Profit” cam­paign, with a coali­tion of civil rights groups and Baron Co­hen wran­gling celebri­ties. Do­ing the speech was “com­pletely out of my com­fort zone”, he said, be­cause “I’ve al­ways been re­luc­tant to be a celebrity and I’ve al­ways been wary of us­ing my fame to push any po­lit­i­cal views, re­ally”.</p>
    <p>EM­BED­DING WITH CON­SPIR­ACY THE­O­RISTS</p>
    <p>Baron Co­hen started study­ing anti-Semitism at Cam­bridge Uni­ver­sity, when he wrote his the­sis on “the Black-Jewish al­liance” and iden­tity pol­i­tics in the civil rights move­ment. So he was primed to play the puck­ish Hoff­man.</p>
    <p>“Es­sen­tially, he was try­ing to be a stand-up co­me­dian,” Baron Co­hen said of Hoff­man, who was a founder of the Yip­pies and preached flower power. “He was very in­flu­enced by Lenny Bruce and he re­alised that if he could make peo­ple laugh, he could get them en­gaged in the cause.”</p>
    <p>While he calls him­self “this co­me­dian who’s dab­bled in a bit of act­ing over the years”, Baron Co­hen is, like all great clowns – yes, he went to clown school, L’Ecole Philippe Gaulier – able to switch eas­ily from light to dark.</p>
    <p>And, he has a ter­rific singing voice, which he showed off in Sweeney Todd, Les Mis­er­ables and at David Gef­fen’s 75th birth­day party, when he sang If I Were A Rich Man from Fid­dler On The Roof and chaffed the bil­lion­aires and mil­lion­aires in the room that they made up “the world’s third largest econ­omy”.</p>
    <p>Sorkin, who wrote and di­rected the Chicago 7 film, said that the day Baron Co­hen shot his scene on the wit­ness stand re­minded him of the day Jack Ni­chol­son shot his court­room scene in A Few</p>
    <p>Good Men, not­ing: “Every­one wanted to watch; 120 ex­tras didn’t care that the cam­era wasn’t on them, they stayed to watch.”</p>
    <p>Baron Co­hen has been com­pared to a raunchy de Toc­queville, and he said he did see a huge change in Amer­i­can so­ci­ety from the time he first went out to shoot Bo­rat 15 years ago to the time he made the se­quel.</p>
    <p>“In 2005, you needed a char­ac­ter like Bo­rat who was misog­y­nist, racist, anti-Semitic to get peo­ple to re­veal their in­ner prej­u­dices,” the ac­tor said. “Now those in­ner prej­u­dices are overt. Racists are proud of be­ing racists.” When the pres­i­dent is “an overt racist, an overt fas­cist”, the ac­tor said, “it al­lows the rest of so­ci­ety to change their di­a­logue, too”.</p>
    <p>“My aim here was not to ex­pose racism and anti-Semitism,” he said of the se­quel. “The aim is to make peo­ple laugh, but we re­veal the dan­ger­ous slide to au­thor­i­tar­i­an­ism.”</p>
    <p>He pon­dered if Amer­ica, un­der a sec­ond term for Trump, would “be­come a democ­racy in name only, sim­i­lar to a Turk­ish democ­racy or a Rus­sian democ­racy”.</p>
    <p>He said he moved in with two con­spir­acy the­o­rists for a few days for the new Bo­rat to show “that they’re or­di­nary folks who are good peo­ple, who have just been fed this diet of lies. They’re com­pletely dif­fer­ent to the politi­cians who are mo­ti­vated by their own power, who re­alised that they can cre­ate fear by spread­ing th­ese lies through the most ef­fec­tive pro­pa­ganda ma­chine in his­tory” – so­cial me­dia plat­forms.</p>
    <p>I had thought that the satirist’s most chal­leng­ing mo­ment was when he fell asleep as Ali G, af­ter drink­ing in Mis­sis­sippi with two old South­ern gents, and some­how, to the amaze­ment of his ter­ri­fied di­rec­tor, woke up in char­ac­ter.</p>
    <p>But in the new Bo­rat, filmed in part dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, he said “the hard­est thing I had to do was, I lived in char­ac­ter for five days in this lock­down house. I was wak­ing up, hav­ing break­fast, lunch, din­ner, go­ing to sleep as Bo­rat when I lived in a house with th­ese two con­spir­acy the­o­rists. You can’t have a mo­ment out of char­ac­ter”.</p>
    <p>He said that when he was pre­sent­ing Bo­rat to stream­ing ser­vices, sev­eral were con­cerned by the po­lit­i­cal con­tent and the idea of run­ning it be­fore the</p>
    <p>United States pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>But the co­me­dian was de­ter­mined to get it on be­fore elec­tion day on Nov 3 be­cause “we wanted it to be a re­minder to women of who they’re vot­ing for – or who they’re not vot­ing for. If you’re a woman and you don’t vote against this guy, then know what you’re do­ing for your gen­der”.</p>
    <p>THE B-LIST</p>
    <p>I won­der if, with all the scenes of his nar­row es­capes from armed cra­zies, div­ing into trap­doors and vans, car­ry­ing a clip­board in case he needed to ward off bul­lets, his wife ever tells him that his job is too dan­ger­ous.</p>
    <p>“If there’s any­thing dan­ger­ous that I’m go­ing to do, I just don’t tell her un­til it’s over,” he said. “I made a mis­take with her. She once came on set just for fun. On set means com­ing to the mini­van, which car­ried me around when we were shoot­ing Bruno. And there ended up be­ing a po­lice chase. I was in a sep­a­rate car and the po­lice were try­ing to find me. She found the whole thing so up­set­ting, and she never came back on set again.”</p>
    <p>Fisher, a mod­ern Ca­r­ole Lom­bard who con­verted to Ju­daism for Baron Co­hen, has said that it’s dif­fi­cult to em­bar­rass him.</p>
    <p>“Lis­ten, I do get em­bar­rassed,” he said, but “when I go into char­ac­ter, I get fully im­mersed in it to the de­gree that I’m al­most locked into the char­ac­ter”.</p>
    <p>Baron Co­hen be­lieves, as Ab­bie Hoff­man said, that “sa­cred cows make the tasti­est ham­burger”.</p>
    <p>In Who Is Amer­ica?, he satirised the left with a char­ac­ter who is a pro­fes­sor of gen­der and women’s stud­ies at Reed Col­lege. The pro­fes­sor be­lieves that “the world’s most dan­ger­ous chem­i­cal weapon is testos­terone” and refers to “Pres­i­dent Hil­lary Clin­ton”. He cy­cles and wears an NPR T-shirt and a pink pussy hat and says things like: “In our yurt, we try to chal­lenge the gen­der stereo­types. My son, Har­vey</p>
    <p>Milk, is not al­lowed to uri­nate stand­ing up. And our daugh­ter, Malala, is obliged to uri­nate stand­ing up.”</p>
    <p>Baron Co­hen ex­plained that his aim was “to chal­lenge and mock the ab­sur­dity of the ex­treme left, too”, fault­ing “the in­ef­fec­tive­ness of ex­trem­ists on the left who are un­able to ask a sim­ple ques­tion be­cause there’re so many qual­i­fi­ca­tions be­fore ev­ery sen­tence so that they don’t of­fend any­one”.</p>
    <p>Other co­me­di­ans speak of his work with awe, par­tic­u­larly the sketches mock­ing the left that surely hurt his award prospects in Hol­ly­wood.</p>
    <p>If you wrote down a list of what con­sti­tutes ex­cel­lence, said Bill Ma­her, it would be epit­o­mised by Baron Co­hen.</p>
    <p>“Orig­i­nal­ity, courage, de­gree of dif­fi­culty, laugh-out-loud funny,” Ma­her said. “What he gets peo­ple to re­veal about them­selves, and in so do­ing, the coun­try, is as­ton­ish­ing. He’s a ge­nius in a league of his own.”</p>
    <p>I ask Baron Co­hen how two A-list stars, who have three chil­dren, make it work.</p>
    <p>“Luck­ily, we’re not A-list,” he said. “I re­mem­ber once in Hol­ly­wood, I was try­ing to avoid be­ing pho­tographed by pa­parazzi. I think I put some­thing in front of my face when ex­it­ing a restau­rant and this photograph­er shouted, ‘You’re only a B-lis­ter!’ And I said to Isla: ‘Oh, my God, we’re B-lis­ters! We made it! We’re B-lis­ters.’”</p>
    <p>He mused that “it seems bizarre that we’re still mar­ried in Hol­ly­wood af­ter so many years”.</p>
    <p>They met in Syd­ney, Aus­tralia, circa 2000. Was he en­sor­celled at first sight?</p>
    <p>“She was hi­lar­i­ous,” he said. “We were at a very pre­ten­tious party, and me and her bonded over tak­ing the mick out of the other peo­ple in the party. I knew in­stantly. I don’t know if she did.” He chuck­led. “It’s taken her about 20 years to know.”</p>
    <p>So what is he do­ing now that he can take a breath as his two movies open?</p>
    <p>“Well,” Baron Co­hen said, “I might try exercising again be­cause I haven’t done that for seven months.”</p>
    <p>Un­less you count flee­ing crazed Amer­i­cans.</p>
