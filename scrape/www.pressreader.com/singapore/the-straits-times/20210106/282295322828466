    <p>Vac­cine devel­op­ments have given hope that the world econ­omy can re­turn to nor­mal and spur cor­po­rate earn­ing re­cov­ery but while fi­nan­cial mar­kets will trend up­wards, it will not be a straight line and event-driven volatil­ity will re­main a fea­ture of 2021.</p>
    <p>That, in a nut­shell, seems to be the emerg­ing view of ex­perts in their 2021 out­look themes.</p>
    <p>DBS Bank noted in its CIO In­sights this week that the eq­uity mar­ket “has en­tered a healthy, broad-based up­trend as value/lag­gard sec­tors played catch-up to growth”.</p>
    <p>“Stay in­vested through a bar­bell port­fo­lio com­pris­ing growth eq­ui­ties on one end and in­come as­sets on the other,” said DBS chief in­vest­ment of­fi­cer/strate­gist Hou Wey Fook.</p>
    <p>“On the growth side, buy into IDEA com­pa­nies: In­no­va­tors, Dis­rup­tors, En­ablers and Adapters. At the same time, add ‘vac­cine win­ners’ for a tac­ti­cal re­bound. These in­clude travel-re­lated com­pa­nies, Asian prop­erty, global banks and en­ergy stocks,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>Mr Hou sees the re­cent re­cov­ery of ho­tels, restau­rants, in­te­grated re­sorts and air­lines as a sign that mar­ket in­ter­est is ex­pand­ing beyond just big tech.</p>
    <p>On the in­come side, DBS rec­om­mends Asian and Euro­pean BBB/BB-rated bonds, which pro­vide yield at a time when in­ter­est rates are ex­pected to re­main low for sev­eral years.</p>
    <p>“Main­tain av­er­age port­fo­lio du­ra­tion of five years,” he added.</p>
    <p>The three themes that DBS sees dom­i­nat­ing the mar­ket this year are neg­a­tive real bond yields, at­trac­tive eq­uity risk pre­mium and cor­po­rate earn­ings re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>None­the­less, in­vestors must re­main cog­nisant of the fact that mar­kets could con­tinue fac­ing volatil­ity amid resur­gences of the coro­n­avirus and un­pre­dictable geopo­lit­i­cal events.</p>
    <p>But CMC Mar­kets sees these</p>
    <p>volatile stretches as mere in­ter­rup­tions to a longer-term up­trend this year.</p>
    <p>CMC’s Kelvin Wong noted that the United States stock mar­ket started 2021 on a weak foot­ing amid ris­ing coro­n­avirus cases across the coun­try and in Europe, as well as a lock­down in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>How­ever, with stocks of elec­tric ve­hi­cle play­ers like Tesla and China’s NIO and semi­con­duc­tor plays hold­ing up well, Mr Wong reck­ons the “sell-off seen in the ma­jor US stock in­dices (on Mon­day) is likely not a pre­lude to kick-start a medium-term down­trend”.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts are also closely watch­ing the out­come of the Se­nate run-off races in the US state of Georgia this week.</p>
    <p>A win by the Democrats could</p>
    <p>rat­tle mar­kets as the party would have enough votes to push through a po­ten­tial tax hike by the in­com­ing Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion. If the Repub­li­cans win, mar­kets could surge on con­fi­dence that any pro­posed tax hikes will not get the req­ui­site votes in the Se­nate.</p>
    <p>But many an­a­lysts point out that if the Democrats win the Se­nate, it would en­able the new ad­min­is­tra­tion to push ahead with its mas­sive fis­cal spend­ing plans, es­pe­cially on in­fra­struc­ture, which would ben­e­fit cor­po­rates, cre­ate jobs and boost spend­ing.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the over­rid­ing in­vest­ment theme seems to be Asia, where eco­nomic dy­namism seems very much in­tact.</p>
    <p>Many an­a­lysts see Asian stocks of­fer­ing a com­bi­na­tion of rea­son­able val­u­a­tion, ro­bust earn­ings and sec­u­lar growth.</p>
    <p>UBS noted that Asia is com­ing into a strong cycli­cal re­cov­ery that is en­velop­ing In­dia, Asean and North-east Asia.</p>
    <p>The bank is rec­om­mend­ing Asia’s cycli­cal tech sup­ply chains, lag­gards in Asean and struc­tural growth in­dus­tries. With ar­eas like 5G, fin­tech and smart mo­bil­ity tak­ing off, in­vestors should put their money into cycli­cal semi­con­duc­tors and hard­ware names, UBS reck­ons.</p>
    <p>UBS re­gional chief in­vest­ment of­fi­cer Kelvin Tay sees par­tic­u­larly good value in Korean, Tai­wanese and China-based tech and semi­con­duc­tor stocks.</p>
    <p>One devel­op­ment in­vestors need to be wary of is the low in­fla­tion en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Vasu Menon, OCBC Bank’s ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor for in­vest­ment strat­egy, noted that quan­ti­ta­tive eas­ing (QE) by banks has un­leashed the phe­nom­e­nal power of money, which is cre­at­ing a huge dis­con­nect be­tween Main Street and Wall Street.</p>
    <p>“Stock mar­kets are roar­ing ahead even as peo­ple are still los­ing jobs,” he said.</p>
    <p>With around US$4.3 tril­lion (S$5.7 tril­lion) of cash slosh­ing around in just the US mar­ket, Mr Menon said that in­ter­est rates could re­main low for sev­eral years. While good for bor­row­ers, it will have a se­vere im­pact on re­turns for savers and re­tirees.</p>
    <p>Hence the need to look for yields.</p>
    <p>For Sin­ga­pore in­vestors, the S-Re­its seg­ment pro­vides an op­por­tu­nity for such yields. In fact, Sin­ga­pore is re­garded by many mar­ket ex­perts as be­ing one of the most at­trac­tive yield-ac­cre­tive mar­kets in Asia.</p>
    <p>So what are the risks that in­vestors face?</p>
    <p>“The big­gest risk is in­fla­tion rear­ing its ugly head, lead­ing to in­ter­est rates ris­ing sharply,” said DBS’ Mr Hou. “Our base case is in line with the (US) Fed, which is low in­fla­tion for a while yet.</p>
    <p>Hence near zero rates and as­set pur­chases un­der QE will stay in 2021, lend­ing sup­port to risk as­sets.”</p>
    <p>So the bot­tom line is: In­vest in both growth and cycli­cals to ride the re­cov­ery and mit­i­gate the low in­ter­est rate en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
