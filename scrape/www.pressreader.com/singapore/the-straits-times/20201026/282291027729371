    <p>Be­fore lo­cal Miche­lin-starred eatery Hawker Chan opened its first fran­chise out­let in Kaza­khstan in 2018, the team be­hind it had to con­duct a food-tast­ing trial in Al­maty, its largest city.</p>
    <p>It had to gather feed­back be­fore de­cid­ing “if the mar­ket is ready and pre­pared to ac­cept new cui­sine, new taste from Sin­ga­pore”, said Hersing Culi­nary chief ex­ec­u­tive An­gel Chong.</p>
    <p>Hersing Culi­nary teamed up with hawker Chan Hon Meng to set up the quick-ser­vice eatery which shares the fa­mous chef’s sur­name.</p>
    <p>The out­let was based on his oneMiche­lin-starred food stall in Chi­na­town, Liao Fan Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & Noo­dle.</p>
    <p>Ms Chong said: “We had to tweak our menu ac­cord­ing to the cus­tomers’ pref­er­ences and cul­ture.</p>
    <p>“All dishes with pork have been re­placed with beef, which is still mar­i­nated and served with our Hawker Chan se­cret recipe sauce,” she added.</p>
    <p>But lo­cal tastes have also in­tro­duced a new di­men­sion to Hawker Chan’s of­fer­ings.</p>
    <p>Ms Chong said its eater­ies in Kaza­khstan of­fer kom­pot, a pop­u­lar fruit drink which goes very well with its food.</p>
    <p>“Most of the good qual­ity and healthy restau­rants are pricey in Kaza­khstan. There are some good qual­ity and af­ford­able fast-food restau­rants but they are gen­er­ally un­healthy,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Chong noted that the “Kazakh mar­ket has been ripe for new cuisines and con­cepts”.</p>
    <p>“The mar­ket re­mains hun­gry for good qual­ity, rea­son­ably priced restau­rants,” she said.</p>
    <p>Hawker Chan now has two out­lets in the world’s largest land­locked coun­try. The team ex­pects to spend more time in­tro­duc­ing its of­fer­ings to Kaza­khstan.</p>
    <p>“Braised soya chicken is still seen as ex­otic by the mass mar­ket,” Ms Chong said.</p>
    <p>“Telling peo­ple who have never trav­elled to South-east Asia about the prod­uct, about Miche­lin, about soya sauce chicken rice and its health ben­e­fits takes time.”</p>
    <p>But brand aware­ness of soya sauce chicken, which Hawker Chan is fa­mous for in Sin­ga­pore, is grow­ing. “We have peo­ple from the neigh­bour­ing coun­tries such as Rus­sia, Uzbek­istan and Kyr­gyzs­tan com­ing to us for fran­chise i nquiries,” she said.</p>
    <p>The com­pany will re­veal more de­tails about its ex­pan­sion in the re­gion in time, she added.</p>
