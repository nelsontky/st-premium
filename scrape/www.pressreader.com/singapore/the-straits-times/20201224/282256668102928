    <p>SAN FRAN­CISCO • Ap­ple is mov­ing for­ward with self-driv­ing car tech­nol­ogy and is tar­get­ing 2024 to pro­duce a pas­sen­ger ve­hi­cle that could in­clude its own break­through bat­tery tech­nol­ogy, sources said.</p>
    <p>The iPhone maker’s au­to­mo­tive ef­forts, known as Project Ti­tan, have pro­ceeded un­evenly since 2014, when it started to de­sign its own ve­hi­cle from scratch. At one point, Ap­ple drew back the ef­fort to fo­cus on soft­ware and re­assessed its goals.</p>
    <p>Mr Doug Field, an Ap­ple vet­eran who had worked at Tesla, re­turned to over­see the project in 2018 and laid off 190 peo­ple from the team last year.</p>
    <p>Since then, Ap­ple has pro­gressed enough that it now aims to build a ve­hi­cle for con­sumers, two sources said, ask­ing not to be named be­cause Ap­ple’s plans are not pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple’s goal of build­ing a per­sonal ve­hi­cle for the mass mar­ket con­trasts with ri­vals such as Al­pha­bet’s Waymo, which has built robo-taxis to carry pas­sen­gers for a driver­less ride-hail­ing ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Cen­tral to Ap­ple’s strat­egy is a new bat­tery de­sign that could “rad­i­cally” re­duce the cost of bat­ter­ies and in­crease the ve­hi­cle’s range, ac­cord­ing to a third source.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple de­clined to com­ment on its plans or fu­ture prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Mak­ing a ve­hi­cle rep­re­sents a sup­ply chain chal­lenge even for Ap­ple, a com­pany with deep pock­ets and that makes hun­dreds of mil­lions of elec­tron­ics prod­ucts a year with parts from around the world, but which has never made a car. It took Mr Elon Musk’s Tesla 17 years be­fore it fi­nally turned a sus­tained profit from mak­ing cars.</p>
    <p>“If there is one com­pany on the planet that has the re­sources to do that, it’s prob­a­bly Ap­ple. But at the same time, it’s not a cell­phone,” said a source who worked on Project Ti­tan.</p>
    <p>It re­mains un­clear who would assem­ble an Ap­ple-branded car, but sources said they ex­pect the com­pany to rely on a man­u­fac­tur­ing part­ner to build ve­hi­cles. And there is a chance Ap­ple will de­cide to re­duce the scope of its ef­forts to an au­ton­o­mous driv­ing sys­tem that would be in­te­grated with a car made by a tra­di­tional car­maker, rather than selling an Ap­ple­branded car, a source added.</p>
    <p>But sources said pan­demi­cre­lated de­lays could push the start of production into 2025 or be­yond.</p>
    <p>Shares of Tesla ended 6.5 per cent lower af­ter its S&P 500 de­but on Mon­day. Ap­ple shares ended 1.24 per cent higher af­ter the news.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple has de­cided to tap out­side part­ners for el­e­ments of the sys­tem, in­clud­ing Li­dar sen­sors, which help self-driv­ing cars get a three-di­men­sional view of the road, two sources said.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple’s car might fea­ture mul­ti­ple Li­dar sen­sors for scan­ning dif­fer­ent dis­tances, an­other per­son said, adding that some sen­sors could be de­rived from Ap­ple’s in­ter­nally de­vel­oped Li­dar units.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple’s iPhone 12 Pro and iPad Pro mod­els re­leased this year both fea­ture Li­dar sen­sors.</p>
    <p>As for the car’s bat­tery, Ap­ple plans to use a unique “mono­cell” de­sign that bulks up the in­di­vid­ual cells in the bat­tery and frees up space in­side the bat­tery pack by elim­i­nat­ing pouches and mod­ules that hold bat­tery ma­te­ri­als, one of the peo­ple said.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple’s de­sign means that more ac­tive ma­te­rial can be packed in­side the bat­tery, giv­ing the car a po­ten­tially longer range. Ap­ple is ex­am­in­ing a chem­istry for the bat­tery called LFP, or lithium iron phos­phate, the per­son said, which is less likely to over­heat and is thus safer than other types of lithi­u­mion bat­ter­ies.</p>
    <p>“It’s next level. Like the first time you saw the iPhone,” the per­son said of Ap­ple’s bat­tery tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple had pre­vi­ously en­gaged Magna In­ter­na­tional in talks about man­u­fac­tur­ing a car, but the talks pe­tered out as Ap­ple’s plans be­came un­clear, a source said. Magna did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>To turn a profit, au­to­mo­tive con­tract man­u­fac­tur­ers of­ten ask for vol­umes that could pose a chal­lenge even to Ap­ple, which would be a new­comer to the au­to­mo­tive mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“In or­der to have a vi­able as­sem­bly plant, you need 100,000 ve­hi­cles an­nu­ally, with more vol­ume to come,” the source said.</p>
