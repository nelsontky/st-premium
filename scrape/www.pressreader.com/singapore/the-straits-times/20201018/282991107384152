    <p>Hu Min and Diego Mon­tero China Daily, China</p>
    <p>One might won­der about the real mo­ti­va­tion be­hind Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s sur­pris­ing pledge be­fore the United Na­tions Gen­eral Assem­bly on Sept 22 to reach car­bon neu­tral­ity by 2060.</p>
    <p>It’s likely that there is some de­gree of geopo­lit­i­cal cal­cu­la­tion be­hind the pledge. But the main driver is the lead­er­ship’s vi­sion of cre­at­ing a “beau­ti­ful China” by pro­mot­ing “eco­log­i­cal civil­i­sa­tion” and a high-qual­ity econ­omy driven by tech­no­log­i­cal in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>Given this high-level and long-term po­lit­i­cal goal of China, we can ex­pect to see the de­vel­op­ment of a slew of short-term fol­low-up poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi’s new-era de­vel­op­ment vi­sion, an­nounced in Septem­ber last year, pro­motes five de­vel­op­ment con­cepts: in­no­va­tion, green, har­mony, open­ness and in­clu­sive­ness.</p>
    <p>More re­cently, China’s post-Covid-19 eco­nomic stim­u­lus agenda has pri­ori­tised “new ur­ban­i­sa­tion and new in­fra­struc­ture”, to pivot the de­vel­op­ment pat­tern away from the tra­di­tional en­ergy-in­ten­sive model.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment of a car­bon neu­tral­ity goal is con­sis­tent with this new de­vel­op­ment vi­sion, and with global cli­mate safety ef­forts.</p>
    <p>China’s move shows its com­mit­ment to the Paris Agree­ment and in­jects new mo­men­tum into the global green growth move­ment.</p>
    <p>It will hope­fully mo­ti­vate the world’s other big emit­ters to get back on track in ac­cor­dance with the agree­ment – and help en­sure a pro­duc­tive UN cli­mate change con­fer­ence in Glas­gow next year.</p>
    <p>The good news is that China’s 2060 goal goes be­yond what is called for by the Paris Agree­ment’s al­ter­na­tive (and less am­bi­tious) 2 deg C goal, which pushes av­er­age global car­bon neu­tral­ity back to around 2070.</p>
    <p>In his UN speech, Mr Xi also said China would en­hance its na­tion­ally de­ter­mined con­tri­bu­tion (NDC) and peak green­house gas (GHG) emis­sions be­fore 2030.</p>
    <p>China’s cur­rent NDC, which out­lines the ac­tions it will take to con­trib­ute to the Paris Agree­ment, states that China will peak its en­ergy-re­lated car­bon emis­sion around 2030. The in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity has been won­der­ing how China would en­hance its NDC in the lead-up to next year’s cli­mate change con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>The shift from “around 2030” to “be­fore 2030” is a mean­ing­ful po­lit­i­cal sig­nal and can be ex­pected to trig­ger changes in China’s do­mes­tic poli­cies. For ex­am­ple, it is likely that China’s new NDC will now have to tar­get non-en­ergy-re­lated GHG emis­sions, in­clud­ing meth­ane and hy­dro-fluoro­car­bon.</p>
    <p>China’s new long-term vi­sion will add new vi­tal­ity to cli­mate pol­icy in the next five to 10 years.</p>
    <p>And the poli­cies could in­clude an ab­so­lute car­bon cap in China’s up­com­ing 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25), a coal con­sump­tion cap, a car­bon mar­ket that cov­ers all ma­jor en­ergy-in­ten­sive in­dus­tries, and prac­ti­cal guide­lines for pub­lic fi­nance in­vest­ment in green re­cov­ery, as well as a long-over­due cli­mate law.</p>
    <p>None of these is new to the pol­i­cy­mak­ing arena, but each has raised con­cerns about its ef­fects on eco­nomic growth and jobs, and has there­fore been de­layed or weak­ened.</p>
    <p>China’s provinces and cities are al­ready de­vel­op­ing ac­tion plans to set and im­ple­ment GHG emis­sion peaks as part of the na­tional peak­ing ef­fort. We can ex­pect some of these re­gions to set car­bon neu­tral­ity goals as well.</p>
    <p>As for in­dus­tries, they will prob­a­bly also need to de­velop sec­toral ac­tion plans. China’s lead­ing cor­po­ra­tions are also likely to con­sider mak­ing long-term so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity com­mit­ments re­lated to car­bon neu­tral­ity.</p>
    <p>And the green fi­nance move­ment, which calls for fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to dis­close their en­vi­ron­men­tal and cli­mate risks, will prob­a­bly also re­ceive a boost.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, China also needs to con­tinue restor­ing the nat­u­ral en­vi­ron­ment and de­car­bonise peo­ple’s life­styles.</p>
    <p>These are some of the key ac­tions China will need to take as it em­barks on the in­spir­ing but chal­leng­ing task of achiev­ing car­bon neu­tral­ity by 2060.</p>
    <p>Call for global ac­tion</p>
    <p>Saleemul Huq</p>
    <p>The Daily Star, Bangladesh</p>
    <p>The his­toric Paris Agree­ment on cli­mate change, which was agreed by all the coun­tries that were part of the United Na­tions Frame­work Con­ven­tion on Cli­mate Change in De­cem­ber 2015, had two ma­jor out­comes.</p>
    <p>The first was to try to keep global at­mo­spheric tem­per­a­ture rise to be­low 2 deg C and, if pos­si­ble, be­low 1.5 deg C.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond ma­jor agree­ment was from de­vel­oped coun­tries to pro­vide a min­i­mum of</p>
    <p>US$100 bil­lion (S$136 bil­lion) a year, start­ing from this year, to sup­port de­vel­op­ing coun­tries in tack­ling cli­mate change through both mit­i­ga­tion and adap­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>The main ve­hi­cle for each coun­try to re­port on its own plans and pledges to con­trib­ute to­wards these global goals was by sub­mit­ting a na­tion­ally de­ter­mined con­tri­bu­tion (NDC), in which ac­tions to re­duce emis­sions of green­house gases in each coun­try would be pledged.</p>
    <p>It was also agreed by all the coun­tries that these is­sues would be ad­dressed and re­vised ev­ery five years.</p>
    <p>Thus, all coun­tries have un­til the end of this year to sub­mit their up­dated NDCs from the ini­tial one sub­mit­ted in 2015, and it is vi­tal that all coun­tries do so within the dead­line.</p>
    <p>It is even more im­por­tant that they raise their level of pledges to re­duce emis­sions of green­house gases well over what they pledged in 2015 if the global goal is to be kept be­low 2 deg C, or even be­low 1.5 deg C.</p>
    <p>If all coun­tries fail to raise their re­spec­tive am­bi­tions by Dec 31 this year, then the next point to do so will not be be­fore 2025, which will be far too late.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, Bangladesh­i Prime Min­is­ter Sheikh Hasina, in her ca­pac­ity as head of the Cli­mate Vul­ner­a­ble Fo­rum, launched a ma­jor global ini­tia­tive called #Mid­nightCli­mateSur­vival to get ev­ery coun­try to sub­mit their NDCs by mid­night on Dec 31.</p>
    <p>But it is un­cer­tain how many coun­tries will sub­mit their NDCs on time, and even more un­cer­tain how am­bi­tious they will be.</p>
    <p>But there are pos­i­tive signs from China and the Euro­pean Union, which have both re­cently an­nounced sig­nif­i­cant am­bi­tious pledges to be­come net zero emit­ters within the next few decades.</p>
    <p>Dec 31 is thus a day of reck­on­ing.</p>
    <p>Cli­mate in­jus­tice</p>
    <p>Neni Cruz</p>
    <p>Philip­pine Daily In­quirer, The Philip­pines</p>
    <p>It does sound like a dooms­day sce­nario.</p>
    <p>Hu­man­ity con­sumes 1.75 Earths a year, us­ing 75 per cent more re­sources that can be re­plen­ished.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines is the coun­try most vul­ner­a­ble to nat­u­ral dis­as­ters in the Asia-Pa­cific, as at 2018. And time is run­ning out on us as we con­tinue to abuse nat­u­ral re­sources.</p>
    <p>It was not too long ago when the call was for sus­tain­abil­ity and cor­po­rate so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity. But sadly, times have rad­i­cally changed, and those buzz­words are now in­ad­e­quate.</p>
    <p>While Covid-19 has dis­rupted our lives and now oc­cu­pies much of the world’s at­ten­tion, it is re­ally cli­mate change that will be more vi­cious and more de­struc­tive in the com­ing years.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, it will also lead to fur­ther in­equal­ity among so­cial classes. We are wit­ness­ing this in the fre­quency and in­creas­ing mag­ni­tude of ty­phoons the coun­try is en­dur­ing.</p>
    <p>In the Global Risk In­dex of In­form, a multi-stake­holder fo­rum for de­vel­op­ing quan­ti­ta­tive anal­y­sis rel­e­vant to hu­man­i­tar­ian crises and dis­as­ters, the Philip­pines was shown to have the high­est hazard risk in Asia in 2018, fol­lowed by Ja­pan, Bangladesh, Myan­mar, China, and In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>What makes the coun­try, es­pe­cially the poor, most vul­ner­a­ble? There’s the nat­u­ral hazard it­self be­com­ing more pow­er­ful with cli­mate change, our poor in­sti­tu­tional ca­pac­ity to re­spond, and our poor in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>We have not had a ster­ling record as far as car­bon emis­sions from coal power plants are con­cerned. We have slid in the use of re­new­able en­ergy from 40 per cent to 25 per cent, while our use of coal has in­creased from 50 per cent to 75 per cent.</p>
    <p>What can or­di­nary ci­ti­zens do to pur­sue a re­gen­er­a­tive way of liv­ing?</p>
    <p>The ad­vice from Mr Richard B. Tantoco, pres­i­dent and chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer of En­ergy De­vel­op­ment Corp: Go be­yond think­ing of do­ing less harm, and think of do­ing more good. El­e­vate one’s ac­tions. If you hurt some­thing, re­pair it. Take a hard look at our habits of con­sump­tion; con­sume only what you re­ally need. me­dia part­ner Asia News Net­work, a group­ing of 24 news me­dia ti­tles.</p>
