    <p>SHEN­ZHEN • The tech­nol­ogy hub of Shen­zhen, no­to­ri­ous for its long work hours, will be­come China’s first city to re­quire that work­ers take paid leave, a move to help re­duce burnout that may be repli­cated in other parts of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>From next year, em­ploy­ers must “strictly im­ple­ment” paid leave, so that those “with a heavy men­tal and phys­i­cal work­load can avoid ex­ces­sive burnout”, ac­cord­ing to reg­u­la­tions ap­proved last month and re­cently ex­plained by the city’s work com­mit­tee, the gov­ern­ment-backed Shen­zhen News re­ported on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Paid leave varies, but em­ploy­ees usu­ally get five days off af­ter one year of work­ing. While the leave is writ­ten into China’s labour laws, en­force­ment is of­ten lax and ig­nored by em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>Hours are gru­elling in the Chi­nese tech sec­tor, where “996” cul­ture, which refers to work­ing from 9am to 9pm, six days a week, is of­ten cel­e­brated.</p>
    <p>Alibaba boss Jack Ma faced a back­lash last year af­ter writ­ing a blog post prais­ing 996 cul­ture as a “huge bless­ing”. He later made a public U-turn.</p>
    <p>In Shen­zhen, home to tech gi­ants in­clud­ing Huawei Tech­nolo­gies and Ten­cent Hold­ings, 996 cul­ture is preva­lent.</p>
    <p>The city’s gov­ern­ment said in June that up­com­ing health reg­u­la­tion re­forms would set an ex­am­ple for the rest of China.</p>
    <p>The doc­u­ment did not spec­ify how many days of paid leave would be en­forced un­der the rule which ap­plies to “staff”, with the sta­tus of con­trac­tors less clear.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to paid leave, em­ploy­ees get time off dur­ing the Chi­nese New Year and na­tional holiday weeks in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral Shen­zhen tech work­ers wel­comed the rules, but re­mained doubt­ful they could be en­forced.</p>
    <p>“In many cases, I’m work­ing over­time be­cause there are too many things to do,” said a for­mer Ten­cent em­ployee who now works for a hand­set maker. “It can be said to some ex­tent that I ‘vol­un­tar­ily’ work over­time.”</p>
    <p>Last month, Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping vis­ited Shen­zhen to mark the 40th an­niver­sary of its spe­cial eco­nomic zone, and the city was granted greater au­ton­omy to pi­lot mar­ket re­forms.</p>
