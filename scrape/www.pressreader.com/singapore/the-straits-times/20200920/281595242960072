    <p>The Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) is “ac­tively mon­i­tor­ing” the sit­u­a­tion faced by for­eign stu­dents, who have dif­fi­cul­ties se­cur­ing jobs af­ter grad­u­at­ing from lo­cal uni­ver­si­ties.</p>
    <p>“The MOE is cog­nisant that in­ter­na­tional stu­dents have to ful­fil their tu­ition grant obli­ga­tions, and we work with the in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing and other pub­lic agen­cies to help fa­cil­i­tate their ap­pli­ca­tion for the nec­es­sary work pass ar­range­ments while keep­ing to the Fair Con­sid­er­a­tion Frame­work,” said a spokesman, re­fer­ring to the Man­power Min­istry’s pol­icy of en­sur­ing that em­ploy­ers do not dis­crim­i­nate against Sin­ga­pore­ans in their hir­ing prac­tices.</p>
    <p>MOE said that in­ter­na­tional stu­dents should ap­proach their uni­ver­si­ties for help if they have prob­lems ful­fill­ing their bond re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>It de­clined to say how many for­eign stu­dents are un­der the scheme cur­rently and what hap­pens to those who are un­able to find jobs af­ter re­peated at­tempts.</p>
    <p>The Tu­ition Grant Scheme was in­tro­duced by the Gov­ern­ment in 1980 to help sub­sidise the cost of ter­tiary ed­u­ca­tion for stu­dents en­rolled in full-time diploma or un­der­grad­u­ate cour­ses.</p>
    <p>Un­like their lo­cal coun­ter­parts, in­ter­na­tional stu­dents and per­ma­nent residents who ac­cept the of­fer of a tu­ition grant are con­trac­tu­ally obliged to work in a Sin­ga­pore-reg­is­tered com­pany on a full-time ba­sis for three years upon grad­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>They are ex­pected to se­cure em­ploy­ment on their own af­ter grad­u­a­tion, and can work for dif­fer­ent or­gan­i­sa­tions over three years in any sec­tor, even if it is un­re­lated to their de­gree or diploma.</p>
    <p>If they do not ful­fil their work ser­vice obli­ga­tion, they are li­able to pay liq­ui­dated dam­ages that in­clude 10 per cent an­nual in­ter­est, com­pounded, which can range from $80,000 to more than $100,000, ac­cord­ing to stu­dents The Sun­day Times spoke to.</p>
    <p>If they have not found em­ploy­ment af­ter a year, they must in­form MOE and pro­vide ev­i­dence of their job search, in­clud­ing all job ap­pli­ca­tions sub­mit­ted and re­jec­tion letters re­ceived.</p>
    <p>In a re­ply to a par­lia­men­tary ques­tion in March 2016 about what ac­tion is taken against in­ter­na­tional stu­dents who know­ingly de­cide not to ful­fil their grant obli­ga­tions, then Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung had said: “Where liq­ui­dated dam­ages can­not be re­cov­ered, de­fault­ers face se­ri­ous ad­verse con­se­quences if they sub­se­quently ap­ply to work or re­side in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>The con­se­quences in­clude be­ing barred from ob­tain­ing a work pass or long-term visit pass.</p>
