    <p>ED­IN­BURGH • Skyscan­ner, the travel book­ing ser­vice owned by China’s Trip.com Group, is pre­par­ing to cut as much as a fifth of its work­force and close sev­eral offices af­ter rev­enues col­lapsed fol­low­ing Covid-19 lock­downs.</p>
    <p>The com­pany in­tends to con­sol­i­date its op­er­a­tions in Bri­tain, close its Sofia and Bu­dapest offices and re­duce its pres­ence in Sin­ga­pore and Mi­ami, ac­cord­ing to an in­ter­nal e-mail from chief ex­ec­u­tive Moshe Rafiah seen by Bloomberg News.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, it an­tic­i­pates “that of our 1,500 Skyscan­ner em­ploy­ees around 20 per cent may leave us”, Mr Rafiah wrote.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a source fa­mil­iar with the plans who asked not to be named, those will ei­ther be let go or ac­cept vol­un­tary re­dun­dancy. The CEO hosted a con­fer­ence call with 1,200 of the com­pany’s em­ploy­ees on Tues­day be­fore send­ing out the mes­sage de­tail­ing the plans, said the source.</p>
    <p>Mr Rafiah wrote that Skyscan­ner’s rev­enues “have been hit sig­nif­i­cantly” and the com­pany is hav­ing to adapt to a very dif­fer­ent travel in­dus­try where “a full re­cov­ery to our pre­vi­ous scale be­fore Covid-19 looks to be sev­eral quar­ters or pos­si­bly years away”.</p>
    <p>A Skyscan­ner spokesman said in an e-mailed state­ment: “While we’re con­fi­dent of Skyscan­ner’s re­cov­ery in the long term and we’re see­ing early signs of growth in the sec­tor, we now know it will take longer than orig­i­nally an­tic­i­pated for travel to re­turn to nor­mal.”</p>
    <p>Trip.com is a dom­i­nant force in China’s do­mes­tic travel mar­ket and ac­quired Ed­in­burgh-based Skyscan­ner in 2016 for US$1.7 bil­lion (S$2.4 bil­lion) in or­der to boost its global am­bi­tions.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the coro­n­avirus pan­demic dis­rupted global travel, the com­pany touted that more than 100 mil­lion peo­ple re­lied on its app and web­site to help them with their travel plans.</p>
    <p>With its main offices in the Scot­tish cap­i­tal and Lon­don, Skyscan­ner will now fo­cus mar­ket­ing op­er­a­tions in Bri­tain and will look for a new of­fice for its re­duced Mi­ami op­er­a­tions while its em­ploy­ees there con­tinue work­ing from home.</p>
