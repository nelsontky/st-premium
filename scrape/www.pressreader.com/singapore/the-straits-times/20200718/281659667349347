    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans are un­likely to be able to travel for leisure this year, though es­sen­tial busi­ness travel will be pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>At a vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said: “Our over­all ad­vi­sory, it re­mains for ev­ery­one in Sin­ga­pore, is not to travel, to avoid all travel.”</p>
    <p>He added that even though the virus sit­u­a­tion is dy­namic and con­stantly chang­ing, the multi-min­istry task force tack­ling Covid-19 – which he co-chairs – does not see things im­prov­ing any time soon.</p>
    <p>“Look­ing at the sit­u­a­tion, the Covid-19 in­fec­tion around the world is un­likely to go away. At the end of the year, it will con­tinue to be with us, even till next year.</p>
    <p>“So, it is un­likely that we will see im­prove­ment in the sit­u­a­tion in the near term, which means that our travel ad­vi­sory po­si­tion is un­likely to change in the near term as well,” he said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, ne­go­ti­a­tions with coun­tries on re­cip­ro­cal green lane ar­range­ments will pro­ceed to fa­cil­i­tate es­sen­tial busi­ness travel, so long as the coun­try Sin­ga­pore is talk­ing to has the ap­pro­pri­ate con­trol mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Green lanes “are not just free for all travel”, re­minded Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>“A trav­eller com­ing in through a re­cip­ro­cal green lane has to abide by and com­ply with cer­tain con­trol mea­sures, in­clud­ing test­ing at the point of de­par­ture and point of ar­rival, and then fol­low­ing a very strict and con­trolled itin­er­ary.”</p>
    <p>He added: “This will not ap­ply to mass tourism travel... that, I think, will not hap­pen any time soon.”</p>
    <p>The task force will also con­tin­u­ally re­view and up­date bor­der con­trol mea­sures for trav­ellers who are en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore, he said.</p>
    <p>In the light of the resur­gence of cases in cer­tain coun­tries, trav­ellers en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore from Ja­pan, Hong Kong and Aus­tralia’s Vic­to­ria state from July 20 will have to serve their stay-home no­tice (SHN) at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties in­stead of their own places of res­i­dence.</p>
    <p>They will also have to un­dergo a Covid-19 test be­fore the end of their SHN pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers who left Sin­ga­pore from March 27, de­spite the pre­vail­ing travel ad­vi­sory against leav­ing the coun­try, are re­quired to pay for their stay at ded­i­cated SHN fa­cil­i­ties. Trav­ellers who are not Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens or per­ma­nent res­i­dents also have to pay for their stay at ded­i­cated SHN fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that the cost of each 14-day stay is about $2,000. The Covid-19 test for each per­son costs an­other $200.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said: “In some coun­tries, you are see­ing a resur­gence – it has not been con­trolled at all and the cases are still ac­cel­er­at­ing. So, we re­ally need to re­main vig­i­lant.”</p>
