    <p>A new poll find­ing that 49 per cent of Sin­ga­pore­ans are neu­tral about for­eign­ers here sug­gests that many peo­ple here have mixed views on the mat­ter, said ob­servers.</p>
    <p>Just 14 per cent of re­spon­dents in the tele­phone poll of 2,100 Sin­ga­pore­ans had neg­a­tive views about for­eign­ers, while 35 per cent had pos­i­tive views.</p>
    <p>“(The pro­por­tion of neutrals) is usu­ally quite small in other sur­veys I am fa­mil­iar with,” said Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ol­o­gist Tan Ern Ser. “It sug­gests that peo­ple are ei­ther am­biva­lent, just un­will­ing to com­mit, or ba­si­cally luke­warm.”</p>
    <p>The pro­por­tion of those un­happy with for­eign­ers creeps up among the un­em­ployed, with 26 per cent of them ex­press­ing neg­a­tive views, com­pared with 14 per cent of those who are em­ployed.</p>
    <p>The poll was car­ried out amid poorer eco­nomic con­di­tions caused by the coro­n­avirus as well as sen­ti­ments aris­ing from a gen­eral elec­tion and par­lia­men­tary de­bates that high­lighted po­ten­tially dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices among firms re­cruit­ing pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate Professor Tan said the re­sults sug­gested a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of un­em­ployed peo­ple feel they have been dis­crim­i­nated against, and that they are in com­pe­ti­tion with for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore­ans want to be fairly treated with re­gard to jobs which they de­sire and for which they are suit­ably qual­i­fied. I don’t think they are anti-for­eigner; they are just un­happy about hir­ing and pro­mo­tion prac­tices that seem un­fair to them.”</p>
    <p>In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies (IPS) se­nior re­search fel­low Mathew Mathews said the big pro­por­tion of neutrals sug­gested peo­ple’s con­flict­ing feel­ings.</p>
    <p>While most Sin­ga­pore­ans recog­nise for­eign­ers’ im­por­tance to the coun­try’s econ­omy and so­ci­ety, he said, they may not be overly pos­i­tive about their pres­ence here dur­ing eco­nomic down­turns.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the re­sults sug­gest that xeno­pho­bic on­line vit­riol is not re­flec­tive of how the majority of Sin­ga­pore­ans feel.</p>
    <p>He said: “It is ex­pected that there will be a small por­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans who are re­ally up­set about the for­eign­ers’ pres­ence here. The re­al­ity, though, is that this group is much smaller.</p>
    <p>“Even if (most Sin­ga­pore­ans) may not al­ways be happy with im­mi­grants, they ac­cept that, on bal­ance, there is a real need for them here.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sci­ences as­so­ci­ate professor of eco­nomics Wal­ter Th­e­seira said there is a nat­u­ral ten­dency to be bi­ased against im­mi­grants, and that peo­ple who are more bi­ased tend to have more di­rect in­ter­ac­tion with im­mi­grants, es­pe­cially lower-in­come, less ed­u­cated work­ers.</p>
    <p>He said what is more help­ful than ask­ing for sen­ti­ments about im­mi­grants is to high­light facts, such as the num­ber of them here and the per­cent­age who are un­em­ployed.</p>
    <p>“This al­lows for com­par­ing per­cep­tions of facts with the ac­tual truth... Peo­ple (also) tend to re­spect hard work and feel bet­ter about mi­grants if they are re­minded mi­grants do work and have as­pi­ra­tions for their fu­ture like ev­ery­one else.”</p>
