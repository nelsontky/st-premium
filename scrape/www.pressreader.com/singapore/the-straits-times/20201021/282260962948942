    <p>•</p>
    <p>HONG KONG Cathay Pa­cific Air­ways will cut around 6,000 jobs, or 18 per cent of its work­force, and axe re­gional brand Cathay Dragon to help it weather the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the South China Morn­ing Post (SCMP) re­ported yes­ter­day, cit­ing sources.</p>
    <p>The air­line said in June that it was re­view­ing its strat­egy in the light of the travel slump, with “tough de­ci­sions” to be an­nounced in the fourth quar­ter. An­a­lysts ex­pected that it would an­nounce ma­jor job cuts.</p>
    <p>That month, the Hong Kong gov­ern­ment also led a US$5 bil­lion (S$6.8 bil­lion) res­cue pack­age for the air­line, which has been burn­ing through around HK$1.5 bil­lion (S$263 mil­lion) to HK$2 bil­lion of cash a month.</p>
    <p>SCMP said the air­line was ex­pected to an­nounce the job cuts today, adding that the fig­ure had been re­duced from 8,000 lay­offs af­ter gov­ern­ment in­ter­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>The news­pa­per, cit­ing uniden­ti­fied sources, said the air­line will sac­ri­fice Cathay Dragon, but staff and re­sources of the two air­lines would be merged.</p>
    <p>Cathay de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>The air­line last month said it would not ap­ply for fur­ther gov­ern­ment em­ploy­ment sub­si­dies for its main busi­ness units, al­low­ing it to make job cuts at Cathay Pa­cific and Cathay Dragon, though not at bud­get car­rier HK Ex­press.</p>
    <p>Cathay had re­frained from ma­jor job cuts, but Sin­ga­pore Air­lines has an­nounced plans to cut around 20 per cent of its po­si­tions, while Aus­tralia’s Qan­tas Air­ways has said it will cut nearly 30 per cent of its prepan­demic staff.</p>
    <p>Cathay has sent around 40 per cent of its pas­sen­ger fleet to less hu­mid lo­ca­tions out­side Hong Kong for stor­age. On Mon­day, the air­line said it ex­pected to op­er­ate less than 50 per cent of its pre-pan­demic pas­sen­ger flight ca­pac­ity next year.</p>
    <p>Pas­sen­ger num­bers last month fell 98.1 per cent com­pared with a year ear­lier due to bor­der clo­sures, though cargo car­riage was down by only 36.6 per cent.</p>
    <p>Cathay had re­frained from ma­jor job cuts, but Sin­ga­pore Air­lines has an­nounced plans to cut around 20 per cent of its po­si­tions, while Aus­tralia’s Qan­tas Air­ways has said it will cut nearly 30 per cent of its pre-pan­demic staff.</p>
