    <p>No­ble Group Hold­ings, the com­mod­ity trader shrunken by years of losses and a multi­bil­lion-dol­lar re­struc­tur­ing, has paid US$20 mil­lion (S$26.9 mil­lion) to for­mer­chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Ri­cardo Leiman.</p>
    <p>The pay­ment to Mr Leiman, who left the com­pany in 2011 – sev­eral years be­fore its 2018 re­struc­tur­ing – was dis­closed in a pre­sen­ta­tion ac­com­pa­ny­ing No­ble’s third-quar­ter re­sults last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>It fol­lowed a long le­gal bat­tle con­cluded in May, when Sin­ga­pore’s Court of Ap­peal ruled that No­ble had de­prived Mr Leiman of en­ti­tle­ments in­clud­ing the right to ex­er­cise share op­tions when he left.</p>
    <p>When the case was first filed in 2012, Mr Leiman’s re­stricted shares and share op­tions were worth about US$59 mil­lion, Bloomberg re­ported at the time.</p>
    <p>By the time No­ble’s Sin­ga­porelisted stock was sus­pended in 2018, its value had fallen by 99 per cent.</p>
    <p>The set­tle­ment is a sim­i­lar size to a roughly US$20 mil­lion pack­age for­mer co-chief ex­ec­u­tive Jeff Frase re­ceived on leav­ing in 2017, even as No­ble slumped to a loss of al­most US$5 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Mr Leiman de­clined to com­ment on the terms of the set­tle­ment, say­ing only that he had no out­stand­ing le­gal cases against No­ble.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the com­pany de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>While No­ble’s mar­ket value once ex­ceeded US$10 bil­lion, it has be­come a shadow of its for­mer self fol­low­ing a re­struc­tur­ing in 2018 that handed con­trol to its cred­i­tors.</p>
    <p>The US$20 mil­lion pay­ment to Mr Leiman is equal to about 70 per cent of the com­pany’s en­tire staff bill for the first half of this year, when “hu­man cap­i­tal costs” to­talled US$28 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>No­ble’s pre­sen­ta­tion showed the US$20 mil­lion pay­ment as a cash out­flow dur­ing the first half of this year re­lated to the set­tle­ment of a le­gal case in­volv­ing a for­mer CEO. The size of the pay­ment had not pre­vi­ously been dis­closed.</p>
