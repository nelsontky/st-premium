    <p>The re­port on em­ploy­ers placed on the Fair Considerat­ion Frame­work (FCF) watch list raised a num­ber of wor­ry­ing points (47 em­ploy­ers added to watch list over dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing, Aug 6).</p>
    <p>It said the 47 em­ploy­ers added to the list were on top of 1,200 em­ploy­ers pre­vi­ously put on the watch list. It re­ported that 18 of those 47 em­ploy­ers had for­eign­ers com­pris­ing more than half of their pro­fes­sional, man­ager, ex­ec­u­tive and tech­ni­cian (PMET) work­force. Also, 30 em­ploy­ers from the fi­nan­cial and pro­fes­sional ser­vice sec­tors had a high con­cen­tra­tion of PMETs from sin­gle na­tion­al­i­ties.</p>
    <p>It is dis­ap­point­ing that such prac­tices went on unchecked. A watch list process with soft ac­tions seems a weak way to rem­edy this is­sue. Stronger pro­cesses and ac­tion should be con­sid­ered.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power’s (MOM) move to call out these er­rant em­ploy­ers is com­mend­able, as there has been much dis­quiet among lo­cal PMETs over un­fair prac­tices that may have robbed them of em­ploy­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties. MOM also pre­vi­ously an­nounced pos­si­ble pros­e­cu­tion in court among other stiffer penal­ties for er­rant em­ploy­ers. This is an­other step in the right di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>I sug­gest MOM in­sti­tute more proac­tive ver­i­fi­ca­tion and en­force­ment of work­force pro­files up­front be­fore work passes are granted to any em­ployer.</p>
    <p>It seems there has been in­suf­fi­cient or in­ef­fec­tive mon­i­tor­ing of the work­force mix dur­ing the work pass pro­cess­ing stage. Stricter checks would stop any dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing ear­lier on and would also give bet­ter as­sur­ance to lo­cal PMETs that MOM is com­mit­ted to en­sur­ing a level play­ing field.</p>
