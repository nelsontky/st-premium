    <p>• Chelsea man­ager Frank Lam­pard is look­ing for­ward to the re­union with his for­mer boss Carlo Ancelotti, now in charge of Ever­ton, when the two sides meet in the English Premier League at Good­i­son Park to­day.</p>
    <p>The Ital­ian guided the Blues to the league and FA Cup dou­ble in the 2009-10 sea­son, with Lam­pard one of the mid­field main­stays.</p>
    <p>The club’s record goalscorer ru­ined Ancelotti’s trip to Stam­ford Bridge in March with a 4-0 win, but he re­mains full of re­spect for his vet­eran coun­ter­part.</p>
    <p>“I was heav­ily in­flu­enced by him as a player and a man. He’s right at the top of man­agers that I worked with,” Lam­pard said at his vir­tual press con­fer­ence on Thurs­day. “He’s had huge suc­cess at var­i­ous clubs. He was a great coach, a great man and I look for­ward to see­ing him.”</p>
    <p>Ever­ton led the ta­ble at the start of the sea­son be­fore a dip in form saw them slide to ninth place with 17 points, five be­hind third-placed Chelsea, who trailed lead­ers Tot­ten­ham by two points.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Lam­pard is still ex­pect­ing a stern test of their ti­tle cre­den­tials to­day, say­ing: “The Premier League is un­for­giv­ing. They’ve had in­juries. It doesn’t change my thoughts on how to ap­proach play­ing them.</p>
    <p>“We’re happy where we are but there’s a long way to go. Words aren’t im­por­tant at this point.”</p>
    <p>Hav­ing se­cured their place in the last 16 of the Cham­pi­ons League, which re­sumes in Fe­bru­ary, Chelsea can now fo­cus their at­ten­tion on do­mes­tic com­pe­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>Their quest for a first Premier League ti­tle since 2016-17 is of the ut­most pri­or­ity for Lam­pard, af­ter spend­ing over £200 mil­lion (S$353 mil­lion) in the sum­mer.</p>
    <p>“It was im­por­tant for us to win our Cham­pi­ons league group and put that away un­til the new year. Our next four games show how chal­leng­ing it is,” he added.</p>
    <p>Chelsea will be with­out in­jured wingers Hakim Ziyech (ham­string) and Cal­lum Hud­son-Odoi (thigh) for at least two weeks.</p>
