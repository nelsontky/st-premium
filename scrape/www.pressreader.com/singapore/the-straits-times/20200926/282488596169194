    <p>Archifest 2020 is look­ing be­yond giv­ing the world grand de­signs or mag­nif­i­cent ed­i­fices.</p>
    <p>The 14th edi­tion of the an­nual fes­ti­val or­gan­ised by the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Ar­chi­tects is hinged on the theme, Ar­chi­tec­ture Sav­ing Our World, through a process of “cre­ative ac­tivism”.</p>
    <p>In the last few years, ground-up de­sign move­ments have come up with cre­ative so­lu­tions to tackle the world’s ills – from cli­mate change and dis­as­ter re­lief to ur­ban de­vel­op­ment and ad­vo­cacy for com­mu­nity and so­cial equal­ity.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, ar­chi­tects, plan­ners and de­sign­ers have ad­vo­cated through speak­ing out and writ­ing about her­itage, bio­di­ver­sity, sus­tain­abil­ity, food re­silience and, more re­cently, is­sues con­cern­ing health dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We’re liv­ing in un­prece­dented times,” says fes­ti­val di­rec­tor Chong Keng Hua, who started dis­cus­sions in De­cem­ber last year for the fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>“Although it wasn’t planned for this year’s theme to co­in­cide with a pan­demic, it’s ex­tremely timely that we are ad­dress­ing th­ese global is­sues while bring­ing ar­chi­tec­ture to the fore­front.”</p>
    <p>Dr Chong says that since it was not pos­si­ble to have large crowds at the fes­ti­val be­cause of Covid-19, the or­gan­is­ing team de­cided on the first hy­brid edi­tion of Archifest with both on­line and off­line plat­forms.</p>
    <p>This year’s fes­ti­val will be a month-long cel­e­bra­tion of ur­ban de­sign, which kicked off yes­ter­day and runs till Oct 31.</p>
    <p>It will feature both phys­i­cal film screen­ings at The Pro­jec­tor movie theatre at Golden Mile Tower, work­shops and tours, as well as an on­line line-up of con­fer­ences and talks by movers and shak­ers such as Ger­man sus­tain­able de­sign ar­chi­tect Anna Heringer.</p>
    <p>“This has also been a bless­ing in dis­guise, as we now have the abil­ity to in­vite a larger in­ter­na­tional au­di­ence to par­tic­i­pate in the fes­ti­val, mak­ing Sin­ga­pore Archifest 2020 one that brings to­gether the built com­mu­nity from all across the world to lis­ten, share and dis­cuss ideas and pro­jects re­lat­ing to the fes­ti­val theme,” says Dr Chong.</p>
    <p>Also an as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of ar­chi­tec­ture and sus­tain­able de­sign at the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy and De­sign and au­thor of two de­sign books – Sec­ond Begin­nings (2018) and Cre­ative Age­ing Cities (2018) – Dr Chong says: “One trend we’ve no­ticed while talk­ing and work­ing with our var­i­ous part­ners is a col­lec­tive spirit of ‘cre­ative ac­tivism’.</p>
    <p>“We have been deeply en­cour­aged by the sense of re­spon­si­bil­ity and op­ti­mism that the built com­mu­nity shares in craft­ing and build­ing a bet­ter fu­ture for hu­man­ity, and we</p>
    <p>hope that this spirit can be brought for­ward through the fes­ti­val.”</p>
    <p>While last year’s theme on Craft broke with tra­di­tion and dis­pensed with the sig­na­ture main draw of a phys­i­cal pavil­ion, this year’s theme goes even fur­ther with reimag­in­ing the pavil­ion as a vir­tual in­stal­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore ar­chi­tec­tural prac­tice ADDP col­lab­o­rated with OWIU De­sign and pavil­ion part­ners SGGlass and King­board Spe­cialty Resins to cre­ate the SIA-LES Pavil­ion ti­tled Re­claim­ing Con­nec­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>It was se­lected as the pavil­ion de­sign win­ner from 12 en­tries from home-grown and Sin­ga­pore-based de­sign firms. Its vir­tual sim­u­la­tion allows fes­ti­val­go­ers to em­bark on an in­ter­ac­tive 3D tour of the pavil­ion with 360-de­gree views from the com­fort and safety of their homes.</p>
    <p>The pavil­ion in­cor­po­rates light emit­ting sur­face (LES) glass – lu­mi­nes­cent pho­to­graphic print tech­nol­ogy on glass – de­vel­oped by home­grown tech­nol­ogy firm SG-Glass.</p>
    <p>It is said to be the only weath­er­proof build­ing ma­te­rial in the world with a uni­form dif­fu­sion of light that mim­ics moon­light, cre­at­ing an am­bi­ence that is calm­ing yet trans­par­ent to fa­cil­i­tate so­cial dis­tanc­ing, al­low­ing vis­i­tors to the vir­tual site to “see” oth­ers as well.</p>
    <p>“It would be so much eas­ier to sim­ply come up with a so­cially dis­tant, iso­lated ex­hi­bi­tion space,” says Ms Amanda Gu­nawan, found­ing prin­ci­pal of OWIU De­sign, which part­nered ar­chi­tects from ADDP on the de­sign.</p>
    <p>“But we’d rather take the more te­dious ap­proach to en­sure that in a time like this, there is still a way to en­joy the lit­tle yet mean­ing­ful acts like vis­it­ing an ex­hi­bi­tion dur­ing the weekend and feel­ing part of the com­mu­nity while still be­ing safe.”</p>
    <p>Col­lab­o­rat­ing with the com­mu­nity on ar­chi­tec­tural so­lu­tions is also close to the heart of Mr Adib Jalal, co-founder and di­rec­tor of Shop­house & Co, a pioneer place­mak­ing stu­dio in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Place­mak­ing is a multi-faceted ap­proach to the plan­ning, de­sign and man­age­ment of pub­lic spa­ces. It cre­ates pub­lic spa­ces that seek to boost the com­mu­nity’s health and well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>His firm’s “Pod­scape – Sounds & Sto­ries of The City” is a place­mak­ing en­gage­ment tool com­pris­ing a bright yel­low mo­bile record­ing booth, called the Pod, with fa­cil­i­ta­tors invit­ing the com­mu­nity to record and lis­ten to the sounds and sto­ries of their neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>“We think the fu­ture will be more lo­cal and more dig­i­tal at the same time,” says Mr Adib, re­fer­ring to how so­ci­eties are ac­cel­er­at­ing into an era where on­line in­ter­ac­tions such as e-shop­ping, telecom­mut­ing and home-based learn­ing are the norm.</p>
    <p>In March, his team from Shop­house & Co de­buted Pod­scape in Bukit Pan­jang as part of t he Na­tional Arts Coun­cil’s Arts in Your Neigh­bour­hood pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>He says it is now even more im­por­tant to de­sign op­por­tu­ni­ties for hu­man mo­ments and con­nec­tions in the com­mu­nity’s dig­i­tal in­ter­ac­tions, af­ter the iso­la­tion and so­cial dis­tanc­ing of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“One of the fun­da­men­tal prin­ci­ples be­hind Pod­scape is the im­por­tance and pride we have about our lo­cal neigh­bour­hoods.</p>
    <p>“We’ve al­ways be­lieved that it is the con­nec­tion we have with our lo­cal ar­eas – our neigh­bours, lo­cal busi­nesses, neigh­bour­hood fa­cil­i­ties and pub­lic spa­ces – that makes our built en­vi­ron­ment a lov­able place to be in,” says Mr Adib.</p>
    <p>“This pan­demic has only re­in­forced our be­lief that our lo­cal neigh­bour­hoods will be the build­ing blocks of our fu­ture.”</p>
