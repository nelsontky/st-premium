    <p>At the Bu­rangkeng dump site on the eastern edge of In­done­sia’s cap­i­tal, green and blue sur­gi­cal masks and white rub­ber gloves are strewn among the de­tri­tus of daily house­hold liv­ing.</p>
    <p>Moun­tains of waste are churned out by three bull­doz­ers mov­ing at full throt­tle, as trucks line up to un­load trash.</p>
    <p>Waste pick­ers sift through the foul-smelling refuse for any­thing of value as goats scav­enge for food.</p>
    <p>One waste picker, Ms Oom Ko­ma­lasari, 48, said that even be­fore the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, she would of­ten find med­i­cal waste such as nee­dles and in­tra­venous fluid bot­tles scat­tered among the garbage.</p>
    <p>But now, there is more. “Nearby fac­to­ries dis­pose of their masks and gloves here, and many more have been thrown here lately,” Ms Oom told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion is not unique to Bu­rangkeng. In late May last year, sheet piles at the Cipeu­cang dump site on the western edge of Jakarta col­lapsed, send­ing de­bris in­clud­ing masks and gloves into the Cisadane River. The river is the main source of wa­ter for Tangerang city’s nearly 2.3 mil­lion res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>The two dump sites il­lus­trate the strug­gle faced by In­done­sia’s 270 mil­lion peo­ple to man­age the na­tion’s huge moun­tains of waste, which has been ex­ac­er­bated by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Last Oc­to­ber, used Covid-19 test kits and haz­mat suits from a health clinic in Jababeka in­dus­trial es­tate were found at the side of a street in Bekasi, lo­cal me­dia re­ported.</p>
    <p>That same month, to ad­dress re­ports of med­i­cal waste man­age­ment, the En­vi­ron­ment and Forestry Min­istry or­dered re­gional gov­ern­ments to bar hos­pi­tals and other health­care fa­cil­i­ties from dis­pos­ing of their waste in land­fills, which are in­tended for house­hold garbage only.</p>
    <p>Med­i­cal waste gen­er­ated since the start of the pan­demic – be­tween last March and Oc­to­ber – across In­done­sia’s 34 prov­inces amounted to 1,662.75 tonnes, said Ms Rosa Vivien Rat­nawati, En­vi­ron­ment and Forestry Min­istry di­rec­tor-gen­eral for man­age­ment of rub­bish, waste and toxic and haz­ardous ma­te­ri­als, last Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Only 118 hos­pi­tals out of 2,925 hos­pi­tals and com­mu­nity health cen­tres na­tion­wide op­er­ate in­cin­er­a­tors, while only 17 waste dis­posal com­pa­nies are li­censed to man­age toxic and haz­ardous ma­te­ri­als, and all are lo­cated on Java is­land.</p>
    <p>That leaves about 88 tonnes of med­i­cal waste that can­not be man­aged prop­erly each day due to the lack of fa­cil­i­ties, ac­cord­ing to the min­istry’s es­ti­mate.</p>
    <p>Mr Muham­mad Reza Cor­dova, a re­searcher at the In­done­sian In­sti­tute of Sci­ences’ Re­search Cen­tre for Oceanog­ra­phy, said that as the pan­demic con­tin­ues to grip the coun­try, the gov­ern­ment has to act promptly to build in­cin­er­a­tors to avert im­proper dis­posal, par­tic­u­larly in wa­ter­ways and oceans.</p>
    <p>Plas­tic waste re­mains a huge prob­lem for In­done­sia, the sec­ond-big­gest marine plas­tic pol­luter af­ter China.</p>
    <p>“Our big­gest con­cern is that the masks can serve as a new source of mi­cro-plas­tics pol­lut­ing the ocean,” Mr Reza said, adding that when fish and other an­i­mals eat the tiny plas­tic par­ti­cles, it could also be detri­men­tal for hu­mans who eat the tainted seafood.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment plans to build 32 waste man­age­ment fa­cil­i­ties to tackle toxic and haz­ardous waste by 2024.</p>
    <p>Jakarta En­vi­ron­ment Agency spokesman Yogi Ikhwan said: “With the pres­ence of a proper sys­tem in med­i­cal waste man­age­ment, the in­crease in mask waste should not cre­ate a new prob­lem to the en­vi­ron­ment.”</p>
