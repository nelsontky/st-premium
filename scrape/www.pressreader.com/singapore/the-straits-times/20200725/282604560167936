    <p>When the home owner bought this apart­ment, she in­stinc­tively knew that she wanted an open-con­cept kitchen and a con­cealed house­hold shel­ter door.</p>
    <p>She also wanted to have the same “mood and style” as her pre­vi­ous home, which was de­signed by Dis­tinct Iden­tity.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing es­tab­lished a good rap­port with the team, she en­trusted the project to it once again.</p>
    <p>For Ms Am­bika Chowdhry, in­te­rior de­sign ex­ec­u­tive at the home­grown de­sign firm, the chal­lenge was in com­ing up with a de­sign that would make the 1,300 sq ft three­bed­room con­do­minium in Kem­ban­gan feel as spa­cious and lux­u­ri­ous as the 3,000 sq ft landed home the fam­ily had moved from.</p>
    <p>“Be­sides re­mov­ing the kitchen walls and in­te­grat­ing the space with the din­ing area to cre­ate an open liv­ing con­cept, the in­te­rior has been de­signed in a mod­ern luxe style with clean lines and a cosy feel,” says Ms Chowdhry.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily loves to host, so the main liv­ing, din­ing and kitchen ar­eas have been de­signed with this in mind.</p>
    <p>The home owner, an ac­coun­tant who shares the home with her hus­band and mother-in-law, says: “In our pre­vi­ous home, we had a wet and dry kitchen and we spent most of our time at the din­ing ta­ble in the dry kitchen, ei­ther work­ing from home or catch­ing up on each other’s day.”</p>
    <p>They wanted some­thing sim­i­lar in their new abode.</p>
    <p>With the ex­ist­ing kitchen walls re­moved, the kitchen counter and din­ing ta­ble form a lin­ear el­e­ment that ex­tends across both spa­ces.</p>
    <p>Dek­ton is used on the kitchen counter and back­splash and the ma­te­rial fol­lows through to the cus­tom-made din­ing ta­ble, es­tab­lish­ing a con­ti­nu­ity that ties the two spa­ces to­gether. Full-height cab­i­nets be­hind the din­ing area pro­vide stor­age space, con­ceals the door to the shel­ter and serves as a fea­ture wall.</p>
    <p>One of the chal­lenges in de­sign­ing the kitchen and din­ing ar­eas is the struc­tural col­umn right in the mid­dle of the two spa­ces.</p>
    <p>Ms Chowdhry says: “I wanted the col­umn to stand out on its own, which was why I opted for a raw con­crete fin­ish to add a dif­fer­ent tex­ture to the space and give it more char­ac­ter.”</p>
    <p>The clean lines of the mas­ter bed­room are con­sis­tent with the rest of the in­te­rior. Ms Chowdhry re­con­fig­ured the lay­out such that the bed and head­board are against the floorto-ceil­ing win­dow. This ar­range­ment takes ad­van­tage of the length of the room and ac­com­mo­dates a king-size bed and bed­side ta­bles.</p>
    <p>The home owner says: “It gives an in­ter­est­ing twist to the room and pro­vides me with more stor­age space, as well as a clean wall for the tele­vi­sion set and con­sole.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter eight weeks of ren­o­va­tion that cost around $100,000, the fam­ily moved in just be­fore Chi­nese New Year last year.</p>
    <p>The home owner is full of praise for Ms Chowdhry: “She un­der­stood my tastes and pref­er­ences well and was able to in­cor­po­rate my ideas and fit our life­style into the de­sign.”</p>
    <p>For Ms Chowdhry, the project not only ad­dressed the client’s brief, but also achieved the aes­thet­ics that the fam­ily wanted while “keep­ing the de­sign prac­ti­cal and func­tional for the home own­ers”.</p>
