    <p>LONDON • For­mer Eng­land boss Sam Al­lardyce re­turned to man­age­ment for the first time in 21/ years</p>
    <p>2 af­ter be­ing ap­pointed as West Bromwich Al­bion man­ager on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The 66-year-old takes over the Premier League strug­glers af­ter Slaven Bilic was sacked de­spite earn­ing a 1-1 draw at Manch­ester City on Tues­day. The Bag­gies are 19th in the ta­ble on seven points but sit just two points off safety.</p>
    <p>English­man Al­lardyce has joined on an 18-month con­tract and will take charge for the first time in a Mid­lands derby against As­ton Villa on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>“In Sam, we have a man who has a proven Premier League pedi­gree with a track record of im­prov­ing ev­ery club he has man­aged,” said Luke Dowl­ing, West Brom’s sport­ing and tech­ni­cal di­rec­tor. “We be­lieve and, more im­por­tantly, Sam be­lieves we have a group of play­ers that have the qual­ity needed to give the club its best chance of Premier League sur­vival.”</p>
    <p>Bilic, 52, led West Brom back to the top flight in his only full sea­son in charge, but paid the price for win­ning just one of the club’s first 13 Premier League games of the cam­paign.</p>
    <p>The Croat’s re­la­tion­ship with the club’s board had also soured in re­cent months af­ter he was given lit­tle fund­ing to bring in play­ers in the close sea­son.</p>
    <p>He be­came the first man­age­rial ca­su­alty of the Premier League sea­son.</p>
    <p>Al­lardyce was named Eng­land man­ager in 2016 but was sacked 67 days later. He has not been in­volved in a coach­ing role since be­ing fired by Ever­ton in May 2018.</p>
    <p>But he has a wealth of ex­pe­ri­ence when it comes to keep­ing sides in the Premier League and now takes charge of a record eighth club af­ter pre­vi­ous spells at Bolton, West Ham, New­cas­tle, Black­burn, Sun­der­land and Crys­tal Palace.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to The Daily Mail, Al­lardyce will earn a £2 mil­lion (S$3.6 mil­lion) bonus should he keep the Bag­gies up but also has a break clause in his con­tract should they be rel­e­gated.</p>
