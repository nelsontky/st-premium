    <p>•</p>
    <p>Nearly ev­ery week­day morn­ing, Valentin Vi­var curls up in bed next to his older sis­ter, Araceli, and switches on one of his favourite tele­vi­sion shows.</p>
    <p>The hour-long pro­gramme, Let’s Learn NYC!, is not typ­i­cal chil­dren’s fare.</p>
    <p>Valentin, five, watches as ed­u­ca­tors from New York City public schools teach math­e­mat­ics and sci­ence, sing songs and take view­ers on vir­tual field trips to botan­i­cal gar­dens and dance per­for­mances. Araceli, 17, is there to help out.</p>
    <p>After the coro­n­avirus pan­demic shut down schools in March, the sib­lings at­tended vir­tual classes from their apart­ment in Queens on Araceli’s iPhone. Their par­ents could not af­ford an­other de­vice and their class at­ten­dance was spo­radic be­cause some­times both had school at the same time.</p>
    <p>Valentin, who needed speech ther­apy, was miss­ing out on con­ver­sa­tions with class­mates and he was strug­gling to pro­nounce words.</p>
    <p>Then a teacher told them about the tele­vi­sion pro­gramme and Valentin was hooked. He sounded out let­ters and words and formed strong bonds with the teach­ers he saw on screen.</p>
    <p>Now, Valentin “wants to read books by him­self and he’s writ­ing new words”, said Araceli.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tors and TV sta­tions in the United States have teamed up to help teach­ers make broad­cast and en­gage chil­dren who are stuck in the dol­drums of dis­tance learn­ing.</p>
    <p>The idea has sup­ple­mented on­line lessons for some fam­i­lies and serves a more crit­i­cal role: reach­ing stu­dents who, with­out re­li­able In­ter­net ac­cess or a lap­top at home, have been left be­hind.</p>
    <p>In some places, the pro­grammes air on week­ends or after school. Else­where, dis­tricts sched­ule time to watch it dur­ing the school day. In New York, the pro­gramme airs ev­ery week­day on a public tele­vi­sion channel.</p>
    <p>Fox sta­tions in sev­eral cities are air­ing teach­ers’ lessons as well, thanks to Ms Melinda Spauld­ing Che­va­lier, a Hous­ton res­i­dent and</p>
    <p>for­mer TV news an­chor.</p>
    <p>She pitched a daily pro­gramme fea­tur­ing teach­ers to her old boss, Mr D’Artag­nan Bebel, gen­eral man­ager of Hous­ton’s Fox sta­tion. He was in.</p>
    <p>Less than two weeks later, lo­cal ed­u­ca­tors were on the air, teach­ing con­densed lessons for an hour.</p>
    <p>In Hous­ton, an av­er­age of 37,000 peo­ple watched the pro­gramme each time it aired in the spring and about 2,200 peo­ple were watch­ing the San Fran­cisco ver­sion each day this au­tumn, the</p>
    <p>TV sta­tions said.</p>
    <p>We Still Teach, the Chicago ver­sion of the pro­gramme, reaches 50,000 house­holds in the area each week­end, ac­cord­ing to Nielsen.</p>
    <p>Public tele­vi­sion sta­tions have sim­i­lar part­ner­ships with ed­u­ca­tors in at least 15 states, ac­cord­ing to Amer­ica’s Public Tele­vi­sion Sta­tions, a non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>“We’re not solv­ing the dig­i­tal di­vide but from my ex­pe­ri­ence with the per­sonal con­nec­tion of com­ing into a viewer’s kitchen or liv­ing room, I felt this could be a more im­me­di­ate way to help bridge the gap,” Ms Spauld­ing Che­va­lier said.</p>
    <p>The plan was em­braced by hun­dreds of ed­u­ca­tors who agreed to set up tripods in their liv­ing rooms, as­sem­ble makeshift props, send in footage and make their broad­cast de­buts.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tors say the pro­gramme has helped chil­dren form deep con­nec­tions with the teach­ers they see on screen – a class­room type of re­la­tion­ship that is tough to re­pro­duce through re­mote learn­ing.</p>
    <p>“There are no frus­trat­ing tech dis­rup­tions,” Ms Spauld­ing Che­va­lier said, ex­plain­ing why chil­dren are of­ten more drawn to the teach­ers on TV than on a com­puter screen.</p>
    <p>“Stu­dents are able to fo­cus on the les­son, on a larger screen, and with a medium that’s com­fort­able.”</p>
    <p>In San Fran­cisco, Ms La­toya Pitcher’s four-year-old son, Levi, is a de­voted fan of the pro­gramme and loves to sing its daily good­bye song along with the school district’s su­per­in­ten­dent Vin­cent Matthews.</p>
    <p>She said the one time she for­got to switch on the pro­gramme, Levi asked: “Mummy, what hap­pened to my friend?”</p>
    <p>“They have (chil­dren’s TV se­ries) Dora (The Ex­plorer) and Blue’s Clues and all that, but this is peo­ple,” Ms Pitcher said. “That’s what they lost with shel­ter-in­place: see­ing peo­ple ev­ery day.”</p>
