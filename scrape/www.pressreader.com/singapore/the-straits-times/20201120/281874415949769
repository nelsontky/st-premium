    <p>WASHINGTON • The Five Eyes in­tel­li­gence-shar­ing group has said that China’s im­po­si­tion of new rules to dis­qual­ify elected leg­is­la­tors in Hong Kong ap­peared to be part of a cam­paign to si­lence crit­ics and called on Bei­jing to re­verse course.</p>
    <p>“We urge the Chi­nese cen­tral au­thor­i­ties to re­con­sider their ac­tions against Hong Kong’s elected leg­is­la­ture and im­me­di­ately re­in­state the Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil mem­bers,” for­eign min­is­ters from Aus­tralia, Bri­tain, Canada, New Zealand and the United States said in a state­ment on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>It brought an an­gry re­sponse from Bei­jing. “I don’t care if they have five eyes or 10 eyes. If they dare to harm China’s sovereignt­y, se­cu­rity and devel­op­ment in­ter­ests, they should be care­ful of get­ting their eyes poked and going blind,” for­eign min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian told a daily news con­fer­ence yesterday.</p>
    <p>China’s Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs in Hong Kong said ear­lier that any at­tempt by for­eign states to threaten or pres­sure Bei­jing to make con­ces­sions was “doomed to fail”.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong ex­pelled four op­po­si­tion mem­bers from its leg­is­la­ture last week af­ter Bei­jing gave city au­thor­i­ties new pow­ers to curb dis­sent.</p>
    <p>The move trig­gered mass res­ig­na­tions by Hong Kong’s prodemoc­racy op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers. It also raised fur­ther alarm in the West about the level of Hong Kong’s au­ton­omy, promised un­der a “one coun­try, two sys­tems” for­mula when Bri­tain ended its colo­nial rule and handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997.</p>
    <p>“China’s ac­tion is a clear breach of its in­ter­na­tional obli­ga­tions un­der the legally bind­ing, UN-reg­is­tered Sino-Bri­tish Joint Dec­la­ra­tion,” the five English-speak­ing al­lies said.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain now con­sid­ers China to have bro­ken the Joint Dec­la­ra­tion three times, in­clud­ing with na­tional se­cu­rity leg­is­la­tion for Hong Kong in­tro­duced this year.</p>
    <p>The US has im­posed sanc­tions on Hong Kong Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam and other Chi­nese of­fi­cials over the crack­down and has warned of fur­ther steps.</p>
    <p>China de­nies curb­ing rights and free­doms in the global fi­nan­cial hub, but the Hong Kong and Bei­jing au­thor­i­ties have moved swiftly to sti­fle dis­sent af­ter anti-gov­ern­ment protests flared in June last year and plunged the city into cri­sis.</p>
