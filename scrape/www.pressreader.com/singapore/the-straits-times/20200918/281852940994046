    <p>NEW YORK • A for­mer model has ac­cused Mr Don­ald Trump of sex­ual as­sault at the US Open ten­nis tour­na­ment over two decades ago, claims that the United States Pres­i­dent’s lawyers have called po­lit­i­cally mo­ti­vated ahead of a high stakes elec­tion on Nov 3.</p>
    <p>Ms Amy Dor­ris, 48, told The Guardian in an ex­clu­sive in­ter­view that Mr Trump ac­costed her out­side the bath­room in his VIP box at the tour­na­ment in New York on Sept 5, 1997.</p>
    <p>Ms Dor­ris, who was then 24, ac­cuses Mr Trump of sex­u­ally grop­ing her, forc­ing his tongue into her mouth and hold­ing her in a grip she was un­able to es­cape from. “He just shoved his tongue down my throat and I was push­ing him off. And then that’s when his grip be­came tighter and his hands were very gropey and all over my butt, my breasts, my back, ev­ery­thing,” she said.</p>
    <p>“I was in his grip, and I couldn’t get out of it. I don’t know what you call that when you’re sticking your tongue just down some­one’s throat. But I pushed it out with my teeth. I was push­ing it. And I think I might have hurt his tongue.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump is­sued a de­nial through his lawyers, who noted that Ms Dor­ris had spent sev­eral days with the real es­tate mag­nate in t he com­pany of her t hen boyfriend, Mr Ja­son Binn, who in 1999 had de­scribed Mr Trump as his best friend.</p>
    <p>But Ms Dor­ris told The Guardian: “I was there from Florida and I was with Ja­son. I had no money, nowhere to go. We were go­ing from event to event and it was over­whelm­ing.”</p>
    <p>She claims she did not fully pro­cess what hap­pened un­til later.</p>
    <p>Now 48 and a mother of twin daugh­ters, Ms Dor­ris said she had thought about speak­ing out i n 2016, when sev­eral other women made sim­i­lar ac­cu­sa­tions against the then-Repub­li­can can­di­date for pres­i­dent, but had de­cided against it. “Now I feel like my girls are about to turn 13 years old and I want them to know that you don’t let any­body do any­thing to you that you don’t want,” she said.</p>
    <p>“And I’d rather be a role model. I want them to see that I didn’t stay quiet, that I stood up to some­body who did some­thing that was un­ac­cept­able.”</p>
