    <p>United States Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence pressed on with cam­paign­ing de­spite a Covid-19 out­break among his aides, cit­ing his sta­tus as an “es­sen­tial worker” as jus­ti­fi­ca­tion for his trav­el­ling de­spite ex­po­sure to the virus.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>BAN­GOR (Maine) US Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence cam­paigned on Sun­day de­spite a Covid-19 out­break among his aides and Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump claimed progress as the coun­try set new records for daily in­fec­tions, prompt­ing his Demo­cratic chal­lenger Joe Bi­den to ac­cuse him of sur­ren­der­ing to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>With eight days to go be­fore the Nov 3 elec­tion, the White House cited Mr Pence’s sta­tus as an “es­sen­tial worker” as jus­ti­fi­ca­tion for his cam­paign travel de­spite ex­po­sure to his chief of staff Marc Short, who tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Multiple se­nior aides to Mr Pence also tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Vice-Pres­i­dent said late on Satur­day that Mr Pence and his wife had tested neg­a­tive. Mr Pence ad­dressed a rally in North Carolina on Sun­day and was in Min­nesota yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The United States has in the past two days reg­is­tered its high­est num­ber of new Covid-19 cases – about 84,000 last Fri­day and nearly 80,000 on Satur­day. So far, 29 states have set records this month for new cases, in­clud­ing five key states in the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion – Ohio, Michi­gan, North Carolina, Pennsylvan­ia and Wis­con­sin.</p>
    <p>But even as the virus surged in many parts of the coun­try, Mr Trump told an air­port rally in New Hamp­shire: “There’s no na­tion in the world that’s re­cov­ered like we’ve re­cov­ered... We are com­ing around, we’re round­ing the turn, we have the vac­cines, we have ev­ery­thing. Even with­out the vac­cines, we’re round­ing the turn.”</p>
    <p>While many Covid-19 vac­cines are be­ing de­vel­oped, none has yet been ap­proved for use in the US.</p>
    <p>“We’re not go­ing to con­trol the pan­demic. We are go­ing to con­trol the fact that we get vac­cines, ther­a­peu­tics and other mit­i­ga­tion ar­eas,” White House chief of staff Mark Mead­ows told CNN’s State of the Union pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den seized on those com­ments, say­ing Mr Mead­ows “stun­ningly ad­mit­ted this morn­ing that the ad­min­is­tra­tion has given up on even try­ing to con­trol this pan­demic, that they’ve given up on their ba­sic duty to pro­tect the Amer­i­can peo­ple”.</p>
    <p>He added: “This wasn’t a slip by Mead­ows, it was a can­did ac­knowl­edge­ment of what Pres­i­dent Trump’s strat­egy has clearly been from the be­gin­ning of this cri­sis: To wave the white flag of de­feat and hope that by ig­nor­ing it, the virus would sim­ply go away. It hasn’t, and it won’t.”</p>
    <p>The out­break among Mr Pence’s aides marked the lat­est White House Covid-19 cases, which have in­cluded Mr Trump, First Lady Me­la­nia Trump, their son, Bar­ron, and numer­ous aides and as­so­ci­ates.</p>
    <p>The new in­fec­tions of­fered a re­minder of the way Mr Trump and his al­lies have down­played pub­lic health ex­perts’ ad­vice to wear masks and ob­serve so­cial dis­tanc­ing guide­lines.</p>
    <p>Mr Mead­ows told re­porters that White House doc­tors cleared Mr Pence to travel af­ter Mr Short tested pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Asked why Mr Pence was not fol­low­ing US Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion (CDC) guide­lines to quar­an­tine for 14 days af­ter such ex­po­sure, Mr Mead­ows on Sun­day cited the Vice-Pres­i­dent’s sta­tus as “es­sen­tial per­son­nel”.</p>
    <p>CDC guid­ance states that “crit­i­cal in­fra­struc­ture work­ers may be per­mit­ted to con­tinue work fol­low­ing po­ten­tial ex­po­sure to Covid-19, pro­vided they re­main asymp­to­matic and ad­di­tional pre­cau­tions are im­ple­mented to pro­tect them and the com­mu­nity”. The guid­ance does not men­tion po­lit­i­cal cam­paign­ing.</p>
    <p>Ex­plain­ing why the Trump cam­paign is not re­quir­ing peo­ple at­tend­ing ral­lies to wear masks, Mr Mead­ows said the or­gan­is­ers of­fered masks to at­ten­dees, but “we live in a free so­ci­ety”.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s run­ning mate, Sen­a­tor Ka­mala Har­ris, took four days off the cam­paign trail this month af­ter an aide tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing in Detroit, Ms Har­ris crit­i­cised Mr Pence for con­tin­u­ing to travel, say­ing: “He should be fol­low­ing the guide­lines.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has mocked Mr Bi­den for wear­ing a pro­tec­tive mask.</p>
    <p>Dr San­dra Nel­son, an in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert at Har­vard Med­i­cal School and Mas­sachusetts Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal, said it ap­peared that Mr Pence would be at high risk of be­com­ing in­fected and trans­mit­ting in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>“With multiple mem­bers of his of­fice test­ing pos­i­tive, this would be con­sid­ered a work-based clus­ter,” Dr Nel­son said. “Any­time there is a clus­ter like this, I would ad­vise that the en­tire of­fice tran­si­tion to re­mote work for 14 days.”</p>
    <p>As of Sun­day evening, al­most 60 mil­lion Amer­i­cans had al­ready voted in per­son or by mail, a pace of early vot­ing that could lead to the high­est turnout rate in more than a cen­tury, ac­cord­ing to data from the US Elec­tions Pro­ject at the Univer­sity of Florida.</p>
