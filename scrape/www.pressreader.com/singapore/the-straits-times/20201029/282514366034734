    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • United States pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Joe Bi­den shared a split-screen with ac­tor Ge­orge Clooney. Mr Bi­den’s run­ning mate, Sen­a­tor Ka­mala Har­ris, joined an on­line quiz with the Mar­vel su­per­hero film stars.</p>
    <p>Hol­ly­wood’s vir­tual fund-rais­ers with Demo­cratic lead­ers have com­bined with pow­er­ful sen­ti­ment against US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump to prompt an un­prece­dented flood of do­na­tions in Cal­i­for­nia – the na­tion’s wealth­i­est state, long seen as the party’s elec­tion cash cow.</p>
    <p>As the race for the White House reaches its block­buster fi­nale, both cam­paigns are mount­ing break­neck tours of swing states. They are no­tably ab­sent in the lib­eral Golden State, where Mr Bi­den leads Mr Trump by more than 30 points.</p>
    <p>But while Cal­i­for­ni­ans can­not sway the race by vot­ing, Demo­cratic in­sid­ers say they have never wit­nessed such an ex­tra­or­di­nary boom in fund-rais­ing and celebrity ac­tivism – even as a deadly pan­demic pushes events on­line.</p>
    <p>“It’s been un­be­liev­able. My in­box is filled with e-mails ev­ery day from var­i­ous en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try peo­ple – the busi­ness side, the cre­ative side, all over... mu­sic, movies, tele­vi­sion, every­thing,” said Los An­ge­les-based Demo­cratic strate­gist Bill Carrick.</p>
    <p>Stars – in­clud­ing the casts of TV shows Se­in­feld, Happy Days and The West Wing – held on­line re­unions. “Co-chair” tick­ets for a Hil­lary Clin­ton talk hosted on­line by co­me­dian Amy Schumer amounted to US$50,000 (S$68,000).</p>
    <p>Tick­ets to a vir­tual live read­ing of 2001 film Wet Hot Amer­i­can Sum­mer last week with Paul Rudd, El­iz­a­beth Banks and other stars of the movie were priced from US$50 each.</p>
    <p>“The pan­demic cre­ated the vir­tual fund-raiser on Zoom, pri­mar­ily, and those are wildly suc­cess­ful,” said Mr Carrick. “All those kinds of things have re­ally ex­ploded.”</p>
    <p>Sacra­mento-based strate­gist Steven Mav­iglio be­lieves Cal­i­for­nia Demo­cratic fund-rais­ing dol­lars are “al­most dou­ble” what they were four years ago – a high base­line, given</p>
    <p>then Demo­cratic can­di­date Hil­lary Clin­ton’s strong sup­port in 2016.</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia “has al­ways been viewed as a sort of ATM”, he added. “But this year, the can­di­dates re­ally haven’t come here much to do in­per­son events. The money’s com­ing to them.”</p>
    <p>The state is the big­gest con­trib­u­tor to Mr Bi­den’s war chest.</p>
    <p>The US$150 mil­lion which Mr Bi­den has raised in Cal­i­for­nia is a</p>
    <p>fifth of his can­di­date com­mit­tee to­tal, ac­cord­ing to the Cen­tre for Re­spon­sive Pol­i­tics (CRP).</p>
    <p>US Fed­eral Elec­tion Com­mis­sion records show Cal­i­for­nia do­na­tions to Mr Bi­den to­talling a slightly smaller US$130 mil­lion, re­flect­ing the com­plex na­ture of cam­paign fi­nanc­ing.</p>
    <p>But both fig­ures dwarf the US$60-odd mil­lion Mr Trump has col­lected in the state.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den is aided by strong Hol­ly­wood con­tacts he forged as sen­a­tor and vice-pres­i­dent – he ap­peared on stage at the Oscars in 2016.</p>
    <p>Di­rec­tor Steven Spiel­berg (US$5.1 mil­lion) and ac­tor­pro­ducer Seth Mac­Far­lane (US$3.6 mil­lion) are among the top in­di­vid­ual Demo­cratic donors this year, ac­cord­ing to CRP data.</p>
    <p>Many strate­gists say vir­tual events have made the es­sen­tial process of har­vest­ing dol­lars eas­ier. Celebri­ties are spared from dress­ing up, shak­ing hun­dreds of hands and bat­tling no­to­ri­ous traf­fic. So are wealthy, busy donors.</p>
    <p>Hol­ly­wood is seen as over­whelm­ingly lib­eral and 88 per cent of the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try’s US$110 mil­lion do­na­tions went to Democrats this year, ac­cord­ing to the CRP.</p>
    <p>But its ex­ec­u­tives have a long history of do­nat­ing to Repub­li­cans, from MGM’s Louis Mayer in the 1920s to for­mer US pres­i­dent Ron­ald Rea­gan’s ex­ten­sive show busi­ness network.</p>
    <p>Still, politi­cos on both sides said big en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try do­na­tions for Mr Trump were down, with the Pres­i­dent skip­ping Los An­ge­les on a re­cent Cal­i­for­nia fund-rais­ing dash hosted by 28-year-old tech multi-mil­lion­aire Palmer Luckey.</p>
    <p>“In the en­ter­tain­ment busi­ness, in par­tic­u­lar, Trump’s just toxic,” said Mr Carrick.</p>
    <p>Con­ser­va­tive fund-raiser Anne Dun­smore sug­gested this year’s Black Lives Mat­ter protests boosted Demo­cratic do­na­tions from Hol­ly­wood, while “other cor­po­ra­tions that might have played on the Repub­li­can side are more ret­i­cent”.</p>
    <p>“It may be pos­si­ble in in­di­vid­ual cases,” said Mr Carrick. “But the most im­por­tant thing is they just don’t like Trump’s pol­i­tics.”</p>
