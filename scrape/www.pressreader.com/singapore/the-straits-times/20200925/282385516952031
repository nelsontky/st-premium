    <p>SOCHI • Lewis Hamil­ton is look­ing to equal Michael Schu­macher’s record 91 Formula One wins at the Rus­sian Grand Prix in Sochi on Sun­day, de­spite fears over a po­ten­tial coronaviru­s fall­out from al­low­ing 30,000 fans to at­tend.</p>
    <p>The six-time world cham­pion will be a clear favourite to suc­ceed on a track where he has tri­umphed four times in six years.</p>
    <p>He has also reeled off six wins in nine races this sea­son to open up a 55-point lead over Mercedes team­mate Valt­teri Bot­tas in the ti­tle race. That in­cluded the pre­vi­ous event at Tus­cany’s Mugello cir­cuit, which held around 2,000 fans.</p>
    <p>But Sochi is pre­pared to host a ma­jor F1 crowd for the first time in the Covid-19 era, and the venue will also see the Mercedes team shad­owed by a Net­flix film crew.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­is­ers say 30,000 spec­ta­tors are ex­pected and that the race is sold out.</p>
    <p>The cam­eras will be record­ing con­tent for the third Drive To Sur­vive se­ries – and tip­toe­ing around their sub­jects, hop­ing to avoid a re­peat of events in Ger­many last year.</p>
    <p>Then, at the Ger­man Grand Prix at Hock­en­heim, run in teem­ing rain, Mercedes cel­e­brated 125 years of mo­tor sports with their worst per­for­mance of the sea­son – a flu-struck Hamil­ton end­ing ninth and Bot­tas crash­ing out from fourth spot.</p>
    <p>“It made a very en­ter­tain­ing episode for Net­flix,” said Mercedes team chief Toto Wolff. “But this time, we hope we can have great con­tent – and have a great race.”</p>
    <p>Rus­sia has ex­ceeded one mil­lion cases of Covid-19 – one of only four na­tions to do so – and af­ter nine events run be­hind closed doors in strictly con­trolled bub­bles, this re­lax­ation of the tight con­trols has not been wel­comed warmly by all in the pad­dock.</p>
