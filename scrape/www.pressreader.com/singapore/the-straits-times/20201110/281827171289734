    <p>WASH­ING­TON • De­nied a sec­ond term by vot­ers, US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump may seek to re­turn to a once-lu­cra­tive ca­reer in tele­vi­sion, this time with a de­cid­edly po­lit­i­cal bent.</p>
    <p>His fam­ily busi­ness will also be free to make up for lost time by once again l ook­ing over­seas, where ho­tels and golf clubs helped drive its growth be­fore his elec­tion in 2016.</p>
    <p>Af­ter win­ning the pres­i­dency four years ago, Mr Trump de­clined to sell off his stake in the Trump Or­gan­i­sa­tion and in­stead adopted a plan that he said would elim­i­nate con­flicts of in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>Among other things, the Trump Or­gan­i­sa­tion pledged to forgo new deals out­side the United States and hired an ethics ad­viser to screen cer­tain do­mes­tic ven­tures.</p>
    <p>Still, the pres­i­dency took a toll on the pri­vately owned fam­ily busi­ness, which has not closed a new ho­tel deal since Mr Trump en­tered the White House.</p>
    <p>With­out of­fer­ing ev­i­dence, Mr Trump claimed last year that be­ing pres­i­dent was “prob­a­bly cost­ing me from US$3 bil­lion to US$5 bil­lion (S$6.7 bil­lion)”.</p>
    <p>The ban on new for­eign deals prob­a­bly dealt the big­gest blow. Be­fore the pres­i­dency, the com­pany was eyeing a ma­jor ex­pan­sion in China.</p>
    <p>No longer con­strained by its self-im­posed ethics plan, the Trump Or­gan­i­sa­tion is now ex­pected to seek ho­tel deals and other busi­ness, ac­cord­ing to sev­eral peo­ple close to the com­pany.</p>
    <p>Even so, there will be nu­mer­ous ob­sta­cles to a re­bound, in­clud­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, law en­force­ment in­ves­ti­ga­tions into the com­pany and a deeply di­vided view of Mr Trump among the Amer­i­can pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tion­ally, if he made an­other run for the White House in 2024, he might need to avoid new for­eign en­tan­gle­ments that could pro­vide am­mu­ni­tion for po­lit­i­cal ri­vals.</p>
    <p>The fastest way for the Trump Or­gan­i­sa­tion to raise money is to flip the switch on its in­ter­na­tional deal ma­chine, li­cens­ing the Trump name to real es­tate projects like ho­tels and res­i­den­tial tow­ers.</p>
    <p>As Mr Trump leaves of­fice, he is pop­u­lar in some coun­tries, and his brand is widely recog­nised. The brand­ing deals are largely risk-free for the com­pany be­cause they do not re­quire cap­i­tal in­vest­ments and gen­er­ally make be­tween US$500,000 and US$1 mil­lion a year, at least ini­tially.</p>
    <p>But while Congress may no longer be as fo­cused on Mr Trump’s busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties, pros­e­cu­tors in New York will con­tinue their in­ves­ti­ga­tions. The Man­hat­tan district at­tor­ney’s of­fice is in­ves­ti­gat­ing Mr Trump and his com­pany for an ar­ray of po­ten­tial fi­nan­cial crimes and is seek­ing his tax re­turns.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the New York state at­tor­ney-gen­eral’s of­fice is con­duct­ing a sep­a­rate civil in­quiry into sus­pi­cions that the com­pany mis­stated its as­sets, pos­si­bly to re­duce taxes or ob­tain loans.</p>
    <p>Mr Eric Trump, who runs the com­pany with his brother Don­ald Jr, last year cited scru­tiny from Democrats and the me­dia as a ma­jor rea­son for sus­pend­ing plans to open a new line of ho­tels.</p>
    <p>With more than US$300 mil­lion in debt com­ing due that the pres­i­dent has per­son­ally guar­an­teed, there may be some ur­gency for the Trump Or­gan­i­sa­tion to line up new deals.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, an ad­verse rul­ing in an au­dit bat­tle with the In­ter­nal Rev­enue Ser­vice could cost him more than US$100 mil­lion, The Times re­ported in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, as of late, has pri­vately raised the idea of run­ning again in 2024. And the pos­si­bil­ity of an­other Trump pres­i­den­tial run could have a chill­ing ef­fect on his busi­ness in the in­ter­ven­ing years, at least in coun­tries like China, where a thicket of eth­i­cal and le­gal con­flicts could arise.</p>
    <p>He also may not be the last Trump to run for elected of­fice. Mr Don­ald Trump Jr and Ms Ivanka Trump may hold fu­ture po­lit­i­cal as­pi­ra­tions, and that could curb some plans for growth.</p>
    <p>The risks are great­est on the in­ter­na­tional front, where po­ten­tial for con­flicts of in­ter­est abound.</p>
    <p>Where and how Mr Trump will re­assert him­self in the fam­ily busi­ness will be one of the in­trigu­ing ques­tions sur­round­ing his re­turn to pri­vate life.</p>
    <p>A one-time re­al­ity TV star, he may in­stead re­turn to tele­vi­sion as a po­lit­i­cal pun­dit or in an­other role, those around him say.</p>
    <p>There have been pre­lim­i­nary dis­cus­sions about ac­quir­ing or start­ing a Trump­branded net­work, for ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>His work on The Ap­pren­tice, tax records show, brought him new sources of cash and fur­thered a myth that would help pro­pel him to the White House, The Times said in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Paid speeches and a book deal could also await him.</p>
