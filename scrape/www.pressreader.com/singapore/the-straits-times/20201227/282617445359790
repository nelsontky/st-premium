    <p>• Jose Mour­inho is pre­pared to se­lect Harry Kane for to­day’s English Premier League clash at Wolves, de­spite the Tot­ten­ham Hot­spur tal­is­man play­ing the whole of their League Cup quar­ter-fi­nal vic­tory over Stoke.</p>
    <p>The striker scored in the 3-1 win on Wed­nes­day to set up a semi-fi­nal against Cham­pi­onship side Brent­ford.</p>
    <p>Spurs face three league games in­side a week – they play Ful­ham on Wed­nes­day and then Leeds on Satur­day – hop­ing to keep up the pres­sure on lead­ers Liv­er­pool, who are six points ahead on 31 points.</p>
    <p>This time last year, Kane suf­fered a ham­string in­jury which side­lined him for six months. He has scored nine league goals this sea­son and has 10 as­sists, with team­mate Son He­ung-min the main ben­e­fi­ciary. The South Korea for­ward has net­ted 11 times.</p>
    <p>“I hope he (Kane) plays the next match,” said Mour­inho. “It was Wed­nes­day, the next match is Sunday, I be­lieve a player like him that works hard and takes good care of him­self with a great pro­fes­sional life, I be­lieve he will be ready to play against Wolves.”</p>
    <p>France mid­fielder Tan­guy Ndombele will also be avail­able for selec­tion. Mour­inho took him off at half-time of the 2-0 home de­feat by Le­ices­ter last Sunday and he missed the trip to the Pot­ters.</p>
    <p>“Tan­guy is fit but he didn’t come to Stoke. My de­ci­sion, but he is fit,” said the Spurs man­ager.</p>
    <p>One player, though, who will not fea­ture for at least the next three league games is Ar­gentina mid­fielder Gio­vani lo Celso. The 24-year-old suf­fered a ham­string in­jury in the Le­ices­ter game.</p>
    <p>“Gio no, he will not be fit,” said Mour­inho. “I don’t know how long he will be out, I be­lieve that he will not be play­ing in this pe­riod of Christ­mas and New Year for sure.”</p>
    <p>He added it would not get eas­ier even though they are fac­ing teams from the bot­tom half in Ful­ham and Leeds af­ter Wolves.</p>
    <p>“Some peo­ple can say now we are go­ing to get an eas­ier run of matches,” he said. “But it’s not eas­ier. We should be happy be­cause it’s a fan­tas­tic league.”</p>
