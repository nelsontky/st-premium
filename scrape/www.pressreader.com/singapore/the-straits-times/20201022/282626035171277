    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • James Red­ford (left), a film­maker, ac­tivist and son of ac­tor Robert Red­ford, has died, aged 58.</p>
    <p>The leg­endary ac­tor’s pub­li­cist, Ms Cindi Berger, said the 84-yearold was “mourn­ing with his fam­ily dur­ing this dif­fi­cult time and asks for pri­vacy”.</p>
    <p>“The grief is im­mea­sur­able with the loss of a child. Jamie was a lov­ing son, hus­band and fa­ther,” she added. “His legacy lives on through his chil­dren, art, film-mak­ing and de­voted pas­sion to con­ser­va­tion and the en­vi­ron­ment.”</p>
    <p>James Red­ford died last Fri­day at his home in Cal­i­for­nia, his wife Kyle said in a post on Twit­ter ac­com­pa­nied by sev­eral pho­tos of the fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“We’re heart­bro­ken,” she said. “He lived a beau­ti­ful, im­pact­ful life and was loved by many. He will be deeply missed. As his wife of 32 years, I’m most grate­ful for the two spec­tac­u­lar chil­dren we raised to­gether. I don’t know what we would’ve done with­out them over the past two years.”</p>
    <p>She told the Salt Lake Tri­bune that her hus­band had died from bile-duct cancer in his liver. The cancer was dis­cov­ered last Novem­ber as he waited for a liver trans­plant.</p>
    <p>The film-maker was a fierce en­vi­ron­men­tal ad­vo­cate and many of his projects fo­cused on raising aware­ness of the en­vi­ron­ment and health.</p>
    <p>He and his fa­ther co-founded the Red­ford Cen­tre in 2005, a non­profit or­gan­i­sa­tion aimed at films fo­cus­ing on the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>“With Jamie came love and con­ta­gious joy,” Ms Jill Tid­man, the cen­tre’s ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor, said in an In­sta­gram post. “He ap­proached ev­ery­thing he did with kind­ness and warmth, and an open­ness that spread it­self eas­ily among others.</p>
    <p>“Jamie worked tire­lessly to build a health­ier world for us all and par­tic­u­larly for those most in need of sup­port. He al­ways led with his enor­mous heart and was guided by his cu­rios­ity and creative spirit.”</p>
    <p>Robert Red­ford has three other chil­dren, in­clud­ing ac­tress Amy Red­ford, with ex-wife Lola Van Wa­ge­nen.</p>
    <p>Their el­dest child, son Scott, died two months af­ter he was born in Septem­ber 1959.</p>
