    <p>The to­tal pro­jected num­ber of Covid-19 deaths in the United States could fall to 275,000 by Jan 1 if mask use among Amer­i­cans were raised to the same level as that in Sin­ga­pore, the In­sti­tute for Health Met­rics and Eval­u­a­tion said in a re­cent re­port.</p>
    <p>WASHINGTON • To­tal coro­n­avirus deaths i n the United States could drop to be­low 300,000 by Jan­uary next year, a model by the Univer­sity of Washington’s health in­sti­tute has pro­jected, if more Amer­i­cans wear masks at the same level as Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“If mask use could be i ncreased to ap­prox­i­mately 95 per cent – the level ob­served in Sin­ga­pore and some other coun­tries – forecast cu­mu­la­tive deaths drop to 275,000 by Jan 1, sav­ing 96,000 lives be­tween now and the end of the year,” the In­sti­tute for Health Met­rics and Eval­u­a­tion (IHME) said in its Sept 23 model up­date re­port.</p>
    <p>An av­er­age of 700 Amer­i­cans are dy­ing from Covid-19 daily, down from the mid-Au­gust peak of around 1,200 daily deaths and all-time high of more than 2,000 in April.</p>
    <p>IHME has forecast that the cu­mu­la­tive death toll in the US could reach 371,000 by Jan 1 as win­ter ap­proaches.</p>
    <p>This is not the first time the in­sti­tute has cited Sin­ga­pore in its re­ports about us­age of masks.</p>
    <p>Early last month, it noted that more Amer­i­cans had started to not wear masks when go­ing out, and that “in­creas­ing mask use to the l evels seen i n Sin­ga­pore would de­crease the cu­mu­la­tive death toll to 288,000, or 122,000 lives saved”.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and his ad­min­is­tra­tion have faced crit­i­cism for their han­dling of the pan­demic, as well as for a lax ap­proach to mask wear­ing and so­cial dis­tanc­ing in the White House.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, there is no fed­eral man­date to wear a mask, and 17 states do not re­quire them, ac­cord­ing to Reuters.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to IHME, the wear­ing of masks is at 48 per cent na­tion­ally, al­though some states – in­clud­ing Cal­i­for­nia, Hawaii, Alaska, Washington and Florida – now have mask use of over 50 per cent.</p>
