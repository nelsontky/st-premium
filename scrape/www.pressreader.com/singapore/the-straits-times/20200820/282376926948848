    <p>An al­ter­na­tive take on the ro­man­tic com­edy that is “sadder, darker and weirder” than your typ­i­cal Hol­ly­wood love story – that is what writer-di­rec­tor Sam Boyd set out to do with his new an­thol­ogy se­ries, Love Life, now stream­ing on HBO Go.</p>
    <p>And this means the pro­tag­o­nists may not end up where, or with whom, you might ex­pect.</p>
    <p>The an­thol­ogy fol­lows a se­ries of peo­ple from their first love to their last, the first sea­son kick­ing things off with a so­cially awk­ward young wo­man named Derby, played by Anna Ken­drick (Pitch Per­fect, 2012).</p>
    <p>Boyd pre­vi­ously wrote and di­rected the indie ro­man­tic drama In A Re­la­tion­ship (2018), star­ring Emma Roberts, which also ex­plored the nu­ances of dat­ing.</p>
    <p>That sparked the idea of ex­plor­ing a per­son’s en­tire life through his or her most sig­nif­i­cant re­la­tion­ships.</p>
    <p>“I felt like that was a fun way of kick­ing the sto­ry­telling up a notch and us­ing a sea­son of tele­vi­sion to tell the story of some­one’s life this way,” Boyd says in a Zoom interview from Los An­ge­les.</p>
    <p>He worked closely with com­edy mae­stro Paul Feig, an ex­ec­u­tive pro­ducer on the show and the writer-di­rec­tor be­hind hit films such as The Heat (2013) and Spy (2015), and the US ver­sion of the sit­com The Of­fice (2005 to 2011).</p>
    <p>It was Feig’s cult teen com­e­dy­drama Freaks And Geeks (1999 to 2000) that pro­vided the tem­plate for Love Life, which does not fo­cus just on Derby, but also ex­plores other char­ac­ters and sub­plots.</p>
    <p>“We were try­ing to do some­thing a lit­tle sim­i­lar (to Freaks And Geeks), which had the skin of a teen soap, but you were also fol­low­ing these other char­ac­ters you wouldn’t nor­mally see in a show like that,” says Boyd.</p>
    <p>“With this, we were try­ing to take the su­per­fi­cial el­e­ments of a com­mer­cial ro­man­tic com­edy and use them to sneak in these sto­ries that were a lit­tle sadder, darker, real-er and weirder,” he ex­plains.</p>
    <p>And the show is about “nos­tal­gia and per­sonal his­tory” too, he adds.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier drafts of the se­ries, how­ever, looked more like a con­ven­tional ro­man­tic com­edy, but that changed as Boyd de­vel­oped it fur­ther with other writ­ers.</p>
    <p>He says: “The (early) episode syn­opses were only about ro­man­tic re­la­tion­ships – it was the first, more ob­vi­ous ver­sion of this idea.</p>
    <p>“But we ended up deep­en­ing that and ex­plor­ing other kinds of re­la­tion­ships – fa­mil­ial and pla­tonic love – and all the dif­fer­ent facets of this char­ac­ter.”</p>
    <p>The project was for­tu­nate enough to catch the at­ten­tion of</p>
    <p>Ken­drick, star of the Pitch Per­fect fran­chise (2012 to 2017) and one of Hol­ly­wood’s most bank­able comedic ac­tresses.</p>
    <p>Boyd says: “It was a very lucky thing – she read it and re­ally re­sponded to it.”</p>
    <p>Once the 35-year-old had signed on, she helped shape her char­ac­ter and the over­all story arc, he adds.</p>
    <p>“I would go over to her house and we would just talk for four or five hours about the re­la­tion­ships we’d been in and philoso­phies of love and life. And a lot of that ended up in the show.”</p>
    <p>He wanted to tell this story from a wo­man’s point of view and to get as much fe­male creative in­put as pos­si­ble, whether it was from Ken­drick, the fe­male writ­ers or his co-showrun­ner, Brid­get Bedard, who worked on the ac­claimed com­edy-dra­mas Trans­par­ent (2015 to 2017) and Ramy (2019 to now).</p>
    <p>“I’m al­ways more in­ter­ested in writ­ing women char­ac­ters – maybe be­cause they’re a mys­tery to me and guys are not.</p>
    <p>“And ob­vi­ously, I was a man who had writ­ten a pi­lot where there was this cen­tral wo­man, and I knew I didn’t want to get a bunch of guys to help me make the show – that would be in­sane and it wouldn’t be good or au­then­tic,” he says.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing Ken­drick, Bedard and other women as col­lab­o­ra­tors, “it just sub­con­sciously be­came this thing where, as we fig­ured out the story, the things that the women said felt real to them ended up in the show”, Boyd says.</p>
    <p>“And for me, it was about know­ing the lim­its of my own ex­pe­ri­ence and tak­ing a step back.”</p>
