    <p>Top­shop and Top­man, which closed their last out­let in Sin­ga­pore yes­ter­day, join a long list of fash­ion re­tail ca­su­al­ties here. The Straits Times looks back at five in­ter­na­tional brands that tried but failed to stay afloat in the tu­mul­tuous re­tail cli­mate.</p>
    <p>1 ESPRIT</p>
    <p>Closed: June this year</p>
    <p>Fash­ion chain Esprit ex­ited the Asian mar­ket, ex­cept China, ear­lier this year. It closed 56 stores in Asia by June 30, in­clud­ing 12 in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong-listed brand had had a pres­ence here since the 1980s and found fans for its well-made qual­ity ba­sics.</p>
    <p>Esprit Hold­ings at­trib­uted the clo­sures to chal­lenges posed by the coron­avirus pan­demic, though ob­servers had noted a slump in sales even be­fore the global cri­sis.</p>
    <p>2 FACTORIE Closed: 2018</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian cloth­ing brand Factorie seem­ingly had the same for­mula as its sib­ling brand Cot­ton On, of­fer­ing af­ford­ably priced fast fash­ion, but was un­able to find sim­i­lar suc­cess.</p>
    <p>Tar­geted at youth, the brand owned by the Cot­ton On Group first en­tered the mar­ket here in 2013 and closed its four out­lets in 2018.</p>
    <p>Factorie prod­ucts can be pur­chased via Sin­ga­pore e-tailer Zalora.</p>
    <p>3 NEW LOOK Closed: 2016</p>
    <p>Think a cross be­tween Top­shop and Cot­ton On.</p>
    <p>The fast-fash­ion re­tailer from the United King­dom opened its first store here in 2009, sell­ing a wide va­ri­ety of wom­enswear, menswear, shoes and cloth­ing for teens.</p>
    <p>It once had stores in 313@som­er­set, Ci­tyLink Mall and West­gate.</p>
    <p>Its Sin­ga­pore dis­trib­u­tor, Jay Gee Mel­wani Group, an­nounced plans for the brand to exit the Sin­ga­pore mar­ket in 2016, cit­ing high busi­ness costs.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>LOWRYS FARM Closed: 2015</p>
    <p>Ja­panese fash­ion la­bel Lowrys Farm had a short-lived pres­ence in Sin­ga­pore, af­ter open­ing here in 2012.</p>
    <p>Its eight out­lets, some in prime malls such as Sun­tec City and Bugis+, were shut by Feb 18, 2015 – a day be­fore Chi­nese New Year.</p>
    <p>The la­bel car­ried ca­su­al­wear mostly in pas­tel or flo­ral tones.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for its par­ent com­pany, Adas­tria Hold­ings, told The Straits Times then that sales were not up to par “be­cause of cli­mate dif­fer­ence and fash­ion taste”.</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>RIVER IS­LAND Closed: 2011</p>
    <p>Yet an­other UK im­port, River Is­land bid a quiet adieu to Sin­ga­pore when it closed its last store at Ion Or­chard in 2011.</p>
    <p>The high-street brand was known for its funky ac­ces­sories and cloth­ing. Some may re­call an edgy fash­ion col­lab­o­ra­tion with pop singer Ri­hanna, which de­buted to mixed re­views in 2013.</p>
    <p>River Is­land re­turned to Sin­ga­pore on­line in 2013, ex­clu­sively via Zalora – which still acts as a bridge be­tween the brand and much of the South-east Asia mar­ket to­day.</p>
