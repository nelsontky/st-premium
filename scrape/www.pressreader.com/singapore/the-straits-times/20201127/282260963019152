    <p>DBS Bank has stepped up sup­port for so­cial en­ter­prises through a record $9 mil­lion in grants and loans this year to help them cope with the im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic. Much of the sup­port has en­abled so­cial en­ter­prises to hire and re­tain peo­ple from dis­ad­van­taged com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the DBS Foun­da­tion said it has awarded $1.4 mil­lion to 13 so­cial en­ter­prises in the 2020 cy­cle of its flag­ship DBS Foun­da­tion So­cial En­ter­prise Grant Pro­gramme. The en­ter­prises were se­lected from a record 820 ap­pli­ca­tions across Asia, and in­cludes Sin­ga­pore-based Ento In­dus­tries, which tack­les food waste.</p>
    <p>Among the oth­ers are Hong Kong-based retail chain Green­price and In­dia-based ElderAid, which pro­vides med­i­cal and ad­min­is­tra­tive sup­port for the el­derly.</p>
    <p>DBS Foun­da­tion board mem­ber Karen Ngui said: “In the world we’re liv­ing in to­day, com­pa­nies must not only think about de­liv­er­ing value to share­hold­ers, but also con­sider the in­ter­ests of the com­mu­ni­ties they serve. This has re­ally come to the fore amid Covid-19, which has sparked un­prece­dented so­cial and economic chal­lenges – yet, these very is­sues have also height­ened op­por­tu­ni­ties for so­cial en­ter­prises to make a dif­fer­ence, and helped to ce­ment the im­por­tance of their role in so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>Two other ini­tia­tives were in­tro­duced this year – the DBS Foun­da­tion Busi­ness Trans­for­ma­tion and Im­prove­ment Grant, and the DBS Foun­da­tion So­cial Im­pact Prize.</p>
    <p>The for­mer, a $550,000 com­mit­ment l aunched i n re­sponse to Covid-19, was awarded to 14 so­cial en­ter­prises across Asia, in­clud­ing three based in Sin­ga­pore: Homage, TreeDots and Bettr Barista. It has sup­ported 6,700 j obs and i mpacted over a mil­lion ben­e­fi­cia­ries and their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore-based Strat­i­fi­care, which de­vel­ops in­no­va­tive med­i­cal di­ag­nos­tic so­lu­tions, bagged one of the two So­cial Im­pact Prizes last month. It was awarded $75,000.</p>
    <p>In a sur­vey con­ducted by DBS Foun­da­tion and the Sin­ga­pore Cen­tre for So­cial En­ter­prise, 72 per cent of re­spon­dents said they are aware of so­cial en­ter­prises and what they do, a sharp rise from just 13 per cent in 2010. The sur­vey, con­ducted in April this year with more than 2,000 Sin­ga­pore re­spon­dents, found that al­most all the re­spon­dents viewed so­cial en­ter­prises as be­ing rel­e­vant and im­por­tant. A to­tal of 95 per cent of the re­spon­dents agreed that so­cial en­ter­prises are a good way to ad­dress so­cial is­sues.</p>
