    <p>Want to book a ta­ble at a restau­rant on a Fri­day or Satur­day night? These days, it is not as sim­ple as click­ing on an app or mak­ing a phone call.</p>
    <p>Restau­rants which never used to do so are now ask­ing din­ers for de­posits to se­cure book­ings. It is usu­ally a hold on the diner’s credit card or an up­front de­posit, which typ­i­cally ranges from $30 to $50 a per­son.</p>
    <p>Chefs and restau­ra­teurs say they have to do this be­cause of no-shows.</p>
    <p>Din­ers not show­ing up, even when they have con­firmed their book­ings, is a peren­nial prob­lem with which many restau­rants have long grap­pled. But it has be­come more crit­i­cal be­cause of the new rules for din­ing in restau­rants dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures have meant that seat­ing ca­pac­ity in most restau­rants has been re­duced by be­tween 20 and 35 per cent.</p>
    <p>The own­ers and op­er­a­tors of 61 restau­rants and nightspots in­ter­viewed by The Sunday Times have coped by in­tro­duc­ing ad­di­tional seat­ing, open­ing for din­ner ear­lier, in­tro­duc­ing time lim­its of 90 or 120 min­utes for meals or stay­ing open be­tween lunch and din­ner.</p>
    <p>Now, they are also tak­ing de­posits to guard against no-shows.</p>
    <p>They have to tread the fine line be­tween be­ing hos­pitable, which is what their busi­ness is about, and fol­low­ing the rules. Aside from re­duced ca­pac­ity, restau­rants also have to en­sure that groups of din­ers can­not be larger than five, guests from dif­fer­ent ta­bles can­not min­gle, guests must wear masks when they leave the ta­ble and no al­co­hol is to be con­sumed after 10.30pm.</p>
    <p>Flout these re­stric­tions and they face fines and manda­tory clo­sures.</p>
    <p>While restau­ra­teurs are clear about the rules, and say most of their guests are too, some din­ers are not.</p>
    <p>Ms An­gela May, culi­nary and events di­rec­tor of Deli­ciae Hos­pi­tal­ity Man­age­ment, says of the fivepax-max rule: “There have been in­stances where a fam­ily of six walks up to the restau­rant, want­ing to be seated. We say we are su­per sorry, we can’t seat them.</p>
    <p>“If one of the chil­dren is a baby, what do you do? The fam­ily just wants to en­joy a meal out. It’s tough.”</p>
    <p>The group runs five restau­rants, in­clud­ing fine-din­ing Mediter­ranean restau­rant Riviera For­lino at One Fuller­ton and ca­sual steak-frites eatery L’En­tre­cote in Dux­ton Hill.</p>
    <p>Own­ers have also trained staff to deal with sit­u­a­tions where din­ers will not co­op­er­ate.</p>
    <p>Mr Alvin Gho, co-owner of wine bar-restau­rant Wine RVLT in Car­pen­ter Street, says: “Many em­ploy­ees are hes­i­tant to tell pa­trons when they do not stick to the re­stric­tions. They need to be em­pow­ered by the own­ers to act.”</p>
    <p>Restau­ra­teur Loh Lik Peng, co­founder of #SaveFnBSG, a coali­tion of 650 restau­rants band­ing to­gether to sur­vive the pan­demic, says: “I think most din­ers know it’s tough on busi­nesses now. Which restau­rant wouldn’t want to sell you more drinks and have more cus­tom?</p>
    <p>“But the re­al­ity is that if we want to avoid what is hap­pen­ing in places like Ja­pan and Hong Kong, then we’d bet­ter err on the side of cau­tion.”</p>
    <p>His Un­listed Col­lec­tion runs 18 restau­rants, in­clud­ing Burnt Ends in Teck Lim Road.</p>
    <p>NO-SHOWS</p>
    <p>Restau­ra­teurs say no-shows are hurt­ing them more be­cause of the hit they took dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, when they could not of­fer dine-in for about three months. Re­duced ca­pac­ity also means they serve fewer peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Ms Sarissa Ro­driguez-Schwartz, chief ex­ec­u­tive and co-founder of the SJS Group, which runs six restau­rants and nightspots, says the sit­u­a­tion has wors­ened as over­seas travel and late-night par­ties in clubs are now things of the past.</p>
    <p>“One of the few op­por­tu­ni­ties for peo­ple to so­cialise is to dine out. This ir­re­spon­si­ble be­hav­iour has al­ways ex­isted. It’s just that this is turn­ing into a so­cial norm – when din­ers feel more en­ti­tled now by the fact that the restau­rants need them more than they need us.” En­ter the de­posit.</p>
    <p>Chope, a restau­rant reser­va­tion app, in­tro­duced the ser­vice in 2016 and had 80 mid-priced and high­end restau­rants tak­ing it up.</p>
    <p>Post-cir­cuit breaker, another 60 restau­rants have signed up for the de­posit-col­lec­tion ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Restau­rants de­cide how much of a de­posit they want to take.</p>
    <p>Mr Di­nesh Balasingam, Chope’s chief busi­ness of­fi­cer, says the amount de­pends on the aver­age bill for the restau­rant. Usu­ally, it is $30 a per­son for lunch and $50 for din­ner.</p>
    <p>Ms Mag­da­lene Tang, owner of Mag’s Wine Kitchen in Keong Saik Road, asks for $50 a per­son to be paid via PayNow.</p>
    <p>Ms Ro­driguez-Schwartz, whose com­pany runs Bar Mi­lano and Pasta Bar in Keong Saik Road, adds: “I have a book­ing sys­tem called Umai at my venues, where if there is a no-show, the sys­tem blocks that con­tact from be­ing able to ever make a reser­va­tion again.”</p>
    <p>Some restau­rants, such as Les Amis in Shaw Cen­tre and Cloud­street in Amoy Street, have no prob­lem with no-shows. Les Amis takes a $150 de­posit – a mea­sure which has been in place for a year. Cloud­street asks guests to pay up­front for the meal when book­ing. Din­ner costs $198++ a per­son.</p>
    <p>Some restau­rants won­der how long they can re­sist ask­ing for de­posits in this cli­mate.</p>
    <p>Chef Dy­lan Ong of The Masses in Beach Road says: “We’re hit hard­est on week­ends. The aver­age num­ber of no-shows is three to four ta­bles, which can come up to roughly 15 peo­ple. We’re not im­ple­ment­ing a credit card de­posit yet – we still trust that guests will ex­er­cise em­pa­thy. We may have to if the prob­lem per­sists.”</p>
    <p>His restau­rant used to seat 65, but with safe dis­tanc­ing, it now seats 39.</p>
    <p>Also re­sist­ing is To­rasho, a 70-seat iza­kaya in Tras Street which used to seat 100. Co-owner Tora Wid­jaja says: “We wanted to im­ple­ment a de­posit sys­tem, but were afraid that would scare off cus­tomers.”</p>
    <p>The FOC Group, which runs three Span­ish restau­rants, is con­sid­er­ing a de­posit from din­ers on busy nights.</p>
    <p>Its spokesman says: “We try to be as flex­i­ble and friendly as pos­si­ble, but we also need to make sure our reser­va­tions are op­ti­mised. It is the only way to keep open and afloat each month, after months of oper­at­ing on ‘sur­vival mode’ with only de­liv­ery ser­vice.</p>
    <p>“We hope our cus­tomers un­der­stand that a sim­ple thing like replying to our e-mail or mes­sage can make a huge dif­fer­ence in ac­tual peo­ple’s lives, and may de­cide whether the restau­rant they en­joy to­day will ex­ist in a few months.”</p>
    <p>IN­TER­MIN­GLING</p>
    <p>Some din­ers show up but skirt the five-pax-max rule by book­ing un­der dif­fer­ent names and ask­ing to be seated near their friends.</p>
    <p>Chef Bjorn Shen of Ar­ti­choke and Small’s, both in Mid­dle Road, had four groups of five book at Ar­ti­choke re­cently. The restau­rant staff re­alised the din­ers were friends only when they started in­ter­min­gling with one another.</p>
    <p>“It’s like try­ing to man­age a bunch of kinder­garten kids,” he says. “We tell them nicely mul­ti­ple times and they say okay, then they do it again five min­utes later.”</p>
    <p>When the staff gave a fi­nal warn­ing, the guests be­came up­set and ac­cused them of be­ing an­noy­ing and pro­vid­ing bad ser­vice. The group also did not want to leave at 10.30pm, the clos­ing time, and staff had to plead with them to va­cate.</p>
    <p>Shen says: “The job of the staff is to pro­vide hos­pi­tal­ity. My job as the owner is to pro­tect the busi­ness and staff. If I have to anger a few er­rant groups to do that, that’s an easy choice.”</p>
    <p>Mr Sid Kim, owner of Vatos Ur­ban Ta­cos at South Beach and Vatos Cantina in Hol­land Vil­lage, has had sim­i­lar prob­lems.</p>
    <p>His man­ager at the Hol­land Vil­lage out­let called the po­lice on two ta­bles re­cently – one with four peo­ple, the other with three – which had con­tin­ued in­ter­min­gling de­spite sev­eral re­minders. They were asked to leave, but re­fused.</p>
    <p>The po­lice were called. While this was hap­pen­ing, a passer-by snapped a photo of the groups and told a staff mem­ber that the restau­rant would be re­ported for vi­o­lat­ing safe dis­tanc­ing rules. The group con­fronted the passer-by and left be­fore the po­lice ar­rived, Mr Kim says.</p>
    <p>“Ninety-nine per cent of cus­tomers are un­der­stand­ing and will lis­ten to you. But there are these few who don’t care,” he says. “Whether you like the mea­sures or not, they are work­ing. We have to stick to them.”</p>
    <p>Ital­ian restau­rant Zafferano at Ocean Fi­nan­cial Cen­tre has also had prob­lems with guests in­ter­min­gling across ta­bles.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, a guest pro­posed to his girl­friend and took her to the restau­rant’s ter­race lounge, to be sur­prised by five friends. They re­fused to break up the party, de­spite mul­ti­ple re­minders, and ar­gued with staff.</p>
    <p>Mr Vadim Korob, the op­er­a­tions man­ager, says: “It was only after we men­tioned that we would have to es­ca­late the mat­ter to the po­lice that these guests fin­ished up their drinks and left within 10 min­utes.”</p>
    <p>Not all guests are un­co­op­er­a­tive. Mr Paolo Campillo, gen­eral man­ager of Parkroyal on Beach Road, says staff at the ho­tel’s Si Chuan Dou Hua Restau­rant had to re­mind guests at two dif­fer­ent ta­bles to keep apart. “For­tu­nately, the guests were un­der­stand­ing and co­op­er­a­tive.”</p>
    <p>Chef Mano The­var of modern In­dian restau­rant The­var in Keong Saik Road says it has hap­pened once in his restau­rant. “We told the guests in a re­spect­ful way that the safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures are there for a rea­son. We then es­corted them back to their ta­ble.”</p>
    <p>AL­CO­HOL AFTER 10.30PM</p>
    <p>In days of yore, din­ers could stay as late as they wanted, or­der­ing as much booze as they wanted. These days, they need to stop drink­ing al­co­hol by 10.30pm – no ex­cep­tions.</p>
    <p>Some restau­rants set clos­ing time at 10.30pm. All the restau­ra­teurs in­ter­viewed have staff re­mind din­ers as early as 9.30pm that drink­ing has to stop by 10.30pm. Many give mul­ti­ple re­minders, in 15- to 30-minute in­ter­vals. But it can be hard to stop when you are hav­ing fun.</p>
    <p>Mr Ig­natius Chan, co-owner of Iggy’s, a one-Miche­lin-starred restau­rant at The Hil­ton, says: “In the first week after re­open­ing, we en­coun­tered a cou­ple of ta­bles giv­ing us a hard time and re­fus­ing to stop drink­ing their wines even after 10.30pm. We had to clear their filled wine glasses. I sus­pect we may have of­fended them so much, we lost these reg­u­lar guests per­ma­nently, as we have not seen them back since then.”</p>
    <p>LeVeL33, a mi­cro­brew­ery and restau­rant in Ma­rina Bay Fi­nan­cial Cen­tre Tower 1, has also raised the ire of din­ers.</p>
    <p>Dr Martin Bem, its founder and man­ag­ing di­rec­tor, says: “The big ma­jor­ity of guests are very co­op­er­a­tive. But, un­for­tu­nately, we have had guests be­com­ing an­gry.</p>
    <p>“One even posted a poor one-star re­view on­line, com­plain­ing of the ser­vice and their din­ing ex­pe­ri­ence be­cause our staff did not give any ex­ten­sion for fin­ish­ing their drinks be­yond 10.30pm.”</p>
    <p>He says it was “the first one-star re­view I was really pleased with”.</p>
    <p>Mr Ron­ald Kamiyama, a part­ner of The Cicheti Group, adds: “By 10.25pm, all al­co­holic drinks are taken off the ta­bles. Even if they’re not done. No ex­cep­tions. At 9.30pm, we give each ta­ble a re­minder, then again at 10pm.”</p>
    <p>Restau­rant staff also have to keep an eye out for guests who for­get to put on their masks when they leave the ta­ble to go to the re­stroom or go home. Oth­ers have food blog­gers and in­flu­encers try­ing to cadge free meals in ex­change for public­ity.</p>
    <p>Ms Tang of Mag’s Wine Kitchen says she was ap­proached by one such in­di­vid­ual. “The per­son claimed to be an in­flu­encer. I asked why I had never heard of them be­fore and I told them to get lost.”</p>
    <p>But some restau­ra­teurs say things are get­ting bet­ter as din­ers come to un­der­stand the re­stric­tions and the con­se­quences of not stick­ing to them.</p>
    <p>Some of those in­ter­viewed ac­knowl­edged that din­ers have the up­per hand in this in­dus­try which, like many oth­ers, has been dev­as­tated by the im­pact of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>#SaveFnBSG co-founder Beppe de Vito, whose ilLido group runs five restau­rants and bars, says: “It’s not a one-way street. We restau­rant op­er­a­tors are try­ing not to let the rules af­fect the ex­pe­ri­ence we give to our cus­tomers, by read­just­ing the way we do things. But we also need the co­op­er­a­tion of our guests.</p>
    <p>“It’s an up­hill strug­gle for us. On the one hand, we are try­ing to give peo­ple an ex­pe­ri­ence, but on the other, we are telling them what they can­not do.</p>
    <p>“Once cus­tomers have cho­sen to pa­tro­n­ise us, they don’t want to be told what or what not to do. We fol­low the law and re­mind our guests of the law, but we need bet­ter sup­port to solve the prob­lems.”</p>
    <p>I’d much rather be open at 50 per cent ca­pac­ity than be forced into clos­ing again.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>RESTAU­RA­TEUR LOH LIK PENG, co-founder of #SaveFnBSG, on why chefs and restau­ra­teurs are fol­low­ing the rules to the let­ter</p>
    <p>I ad­vo­cate that hos­pi­tal­ity doesn’t mean servi­tude. We can say no when we have to. Thank­fully, a friendly re­minder to our guests usu­ally suf­fices. That poli­cies are, in fact, laws to abide by also helps.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>MR SHAWN KISHORE, founder and man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Five Ten Hold­ings, which owns six restau­rants and bars, in­clud­ing The Salted Plum and The No­mads</p>
