    <p>GHAZNI (Afghanista­n) • At least 15 chil­dren were killed when a mo­tor­bike laden with ex­plo­sives blew up near a re­li­gious gath­er­ing in eastern Afghanista­n on Fri­day, of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>The chil­dren had gath­ered at a home in Ghazni prov­ince to re­cite Qu­ran verses, a reg­u­lar ac­tiv­ity on the Is­lamic holy day of Fri­day, when the blast hap­pened.</p>
    <p>Mr Wa­hedul­lah Ju­mazada, spokesman for the prov­ince’s gov­er­nor, said: “Un­for­tu­nately, as a re­sult of this in­ci­dent, 15 peo­ple – all chil­dren – were mar­tyred.”</p>
    <p>Ghazni po­lice con­firmed the blast and that all the vic­tims were chil­dren. Twenty other peo­ple, in­clud­ing some chil­dren, were wounded.</p>
    <p>Peace talks be­tween the Tale­ban and the Afghan gov­ern­ment to end the coun­try’s grind­ing war are on pause un­til next month. Vi­o­lence has surged across the coun­try since the talks opened in Septem­ber in the Qatari cap­i­tal of Doha, with the Tale­ban try­ing to get an up­per hand.</p>
    <p>Tale­ban and gov­ern­ment forces have reg­u­larly clashed in Ghazni prov­ince, where the in­sur­gents con­trol sev­eral ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Thirty se­cu­rity per­son­nel were killed last month when a sui­cide car bomber struck an army base near Ghazni city, the pro­vin­cial cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>Out­go­ing US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has pushed to end Amer­ica’s long­est war, with Wash­ing­ton sign­ing a deal with the Tale­ban early this year com­mit­ting to pulling all of its troops from the coun­try by May next year.</p>
    <p>The Tale­ban has pri­mar­ily tar­geted gov­ern­ment forces in ru­ral ar­eas since sign­ing the deal, in which it pledged to launch ne­go­ti­a­tions with the Afghan gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Afghan Pres­i­dent Ashraf Ghani has called for the next round of peace ne­go­ti­a­tions to be held in Kabul, say­ing it was in­ap­pro­pri­ate to meet in “lux­u­ri­ous ho­tels”.</p>
    <p>Tale­ban ne­go­tia­tors have flown to Pak­istan, where they met Prime Min­is­ter Im­ran Khan on Fri­day. Mr Khan called on both sides to re­duce vi­o­lence and agree to a cease­fire.</p>
