    <p>CON­CERT</p>
    <p>JAZZ AT PLAY: 7 SONGS AT CHRIST­MAS</p>
    <p>Sifa v2.020</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria The­atre, last Thurs­day</p>
    <p>Singer Ale­may Fer­nan­dez re-did her en­trance to the Jazz At Play con­cert last Thurs­day night, declar­ing of the burst of ap­plause that greeted her: “Hold on. We’re go­ing to do that again like you mean it.”</p>
    <p>The au­di­ence promptly re­sponded with even more en­thu­si­as­tic clap­ping and cheers, prov­ing they had missed live mu­sic per­form­ers as much as the lat­ter had missed them.</p>
    <p>Ex­pres­sions of grat­i­tude at be­ing back on­stage were the re­cur­ring grace note of the evening, the first of the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Fes­ti­val Of Arts’ three-night dou­ble-bill pro­grammes of lo­cal mu­sic acts.</p>
    <p>Pian­ist Tan Wei Xiang’s Wei 5 and drum­mer Aaron James Lee’s trio shared the lime­light for the evening, with singers Fer­nan­dez and Sarah Chew com­ing on board for some num­bers.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme for­mat of seven songs by each band – a set list com­pris­ing a Christ­mas song, a jazz stan­dard, an orig­i­nal num­ber, and two songs that rep­re­sent this year and the next, as well as two au­di­ence se­lec­tions – of­fered some di­ver­sity to the evening.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a fluffed note in the open­ing tune, Wei 5 re­cov­ered with a nice take on Poin­ciana, in which drum­mer Lee kept time with an­kle bells – an in­trigu­ing in­stru­ment choice.</p>
    <p>The third song, an orig­i­nal ti­tled El­egy, proved more dis­cor­dant than ele­giac, as the wall of sound threat­ened to dis­in­te­grate in a com­plex mid­dle sec­tion.</p>
    <p>But Fer­nan­dez, a fa­mil­iar favourite with j azz fans here, livened things up the minute she bounced on stage with her ir­re­press­ible en­thu­si­asm.</p>
    <p>She of­fered a con­fi­dent take on Wil­low Weep For Me in her warm caramel tones and teased Wei 5 for choos­ing Last Christ­mas by Wham! be­fore get­ting the au­di­ence to sing along with the cho­rus.</p>
    <p>But the high­light was her sim­ple duet with Wei 5, an achingly ten­der de­liv­ery of For All We Know, which she ded­i­cated to Sin­ga­pore singer Mah Choon Hong. The jazz stal­wart of the 1980s and 1990s died of Covid-19 in the United States ear­lier this week.</p>
    <p>Drum­mer Lee’s trio, with pian­ist Joshua Wan and bassist Ben Poh, proved a tighter en­sem­ble than the some­what scrappy Wei 5.</p>
    <p>Wan’s snappy play­ing, with vig­or­ous nods to Th­elo­nious Monk, was matched with happy bounc­ing on the bench, com­mu­ni­cat­ing his un­al­loyed joy at per­form­ing.</p>
    <p>Singer Chew, stand­ing in at the last minute for singer Richard Jack­son, ac­quit­ted her­self nicely – de­spite a nar­row vo­cal range – on This Love Of Mine, River and We’ll Be To­gether.</p>
    <p>The two-hour con­cert flew by in the blink of an eye, aided by the nov­elty of once again be­ing in the same room as per­form­ers. The good vibes chased away the lit­tle hic­cups of the evening.</p>
