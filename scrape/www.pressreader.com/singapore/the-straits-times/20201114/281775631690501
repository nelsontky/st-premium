    <p>LON­DON/OTTAWA The United King­dom has sum­moned China’s am­bas­sador to protest against the dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tion of four pro-democ­racy leg­is­la­tors in Hong Kong, a move it said breaks the joint agree­ment on po­lit­i­cal and le­gal con­di­tions in the for­mer Bri­tish colony.</p>
    <p>For­eign Sec­re­tary Do­minic Raab said Bei­jing’s new law bar­ring any Hong Kong law­mak­ers who do not recog­nise Chi­nese sovereignt­y un­der­mines the ter­ri­tory’s “high de­gree of au­ton­omy” pro­tected in the Sino-Bri­tish agree­ment.</p>
    <p>“The UK will stand up for the peo­ple of Hong Kong, and call out vi­o­la­tions of their rights and free­doms,” Mr Raab said in an e-mailed state­ment on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“With our in­ter­na­tional part­ners, we will hold China to the obli­ga­tions it freely as­sumed un­der in­ter­na­tional law.”</p>
    <p>Bri­tain said it is the sec­ond time in six months – and the third since the 1997 han­dover – that it has ac­cused China of break­ing the treaty’s terms.</p>
    <p>The state­ments come against a back­drop of height­ened po­lit­i­cal con­cerns in Bri­tain about China’s be­hav­iour, rang­ing from mea­sures to quell dis­sent in Hong Kong to al­leged hu­man rights abuses in Xin­jiang, at the same time as there is grow­ing Chi­nese in­volve­ment in key Bri­tish in­fras­truc­ture projects.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish law­mak­ers from across the po­lit­i­cal spec­trum also called on the gov­ern­ment to im­pose sanc­tions on Chi­nese of­fi­cials as well as Hong Kong Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam, whose gov­ern­ment dis­missed the four leg­is­la­tors fol­low­ing the Chi­nese res­o­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>The res­o­lu­tion is the lat­est sign of China’s push to clamp down on dis­sent fol­low­ing anti-gov­ern­ment protests last year.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has since passed a se­ries of mea­sures as­sert­ing greater con­trol over Hong Kong, first tar­get­ing democ­racy ac­tivists in­volved in street protests and now dis­senters in demo­cratic in­sti­tu­tions set up un­der Bri­tish colo­nial rule.</p>
    <p>But For­eign Of­fice min­is­ter</p>
    <p>Nigel Adams de­clined to com­mit to sanc­tions on in­di­vid­u­als in­volved in the crack­down.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, the Cana­dian gov­ern­ment has said it would make it eas­ier for Hong Kong youth to study and work in Canada in re­sponse to China’s new se­cu­rity rules, a move likely to heighten al­ready strained re­la­tions with Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Any Hong Kong res­i­dent who has grad­u­ated from univer­sity in the past three years can ap­ply to work for up to three years in Canada, and will be of­fered a way to tran­si­tion more eas­ily to per­ma­nent res­i­dency, said Immigratio­n Min­is­ter Marco Men­di­cino.</p>
    <p>Canada will also ac­cel­er­ate the pro­cesses for “their spouses, their part­ners and their chil­dren to come and build the next chap­ter in their life”, Mr Men­di­cino said.</p>
    <p>Last month, China’s en­voy to Canada Cong Peiwu warned Canada against grant­ing asy­lum to pro-democ­racy pro­test­ers, say­ing they were “vi­o­lent crim­i­nals”.</p>
