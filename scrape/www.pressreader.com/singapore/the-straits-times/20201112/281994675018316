    <p>The pro­longed du­ra­tion of the Covid-19 pan­demic with no end date in sight is tak­ing a toll on the men­tal health of many peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The stress caused by the eco­nomic down­turn and de­creased so­cial con­nec­tion has re­sulted in a rise in men­tal health is­sues like anx­i­ety and de­pres­sion (Ex­perts fear long-term ef­fect on men­tal health, Aug 20).</p>
    <p>Men­tal health aware­ness has greatly in­creased thanks to the In­ter­net, so­cial me­dia and ini­tia­tives like Be­yond The La­bel, a na­tional men­tal health anti-stigma cam­paign. How­ever, so­ci­ety’s un­der­stand­ing of men­tal health is­sues and knowl­edge of how to pro­vide sup­port for those deal­ing with the is­sues are still lack­ing.</p>
    <p>Open­ing up and talk­ing about men­tal health is­sues is still very dif­fi­cult for many. There are many un­con­scious bi­ases and deeply en­trenched stigma re­gard­ing the sub­ject, re­sult­ing in in­ter­nalised shame. Some fear be­ing judged, oth­ers do not know how to talk about what they are go­ing through. Peo­ple also choose not to share so as not to bur­den their loved ones, be­liev­ing that they would not un­der­stand. This may in­ad­ver­tently lead to a down­ward spi­ral of thoughts and emo­tions.</p>
    <p>As some­one who has had first-hand ex­pe­ri­ence with men­tal health is­sues, I was con­flicted about speak­ing up. I was con­cerned that my friends would not see me in the same light, and whether they could sep­a­rate my strug­gles from my abil­i­ties. It was also pos­si­ble that they would find me too emo­tion­ally ex­haust­ing and dis­tance them­selves.</p>
    <p>From my own jour­ney, I re­alised that hav­ing the courage to be vul­ner­a­ble and speak bravely about one’s strug­gles to oth­ers can be a very heal­ing ex­pe­ri­ence for both par­ties.</p>
    <p>We can all do our part as a friend to cre­ate a safe en­vi­ron­ment where peo­ple aren’t afraid of open­ing up.</p>
    <p>Although this is not a sub­sti­tute for pro­fes­sional help, some­times all peo­ple need is a lit­tle con­nec­tion, a lis­ten­ing ear from our friends and fam­ily whom we trust and care about, who of­ten are the first ones we turn to.</p>
    <p>The power of lis­ten­ing and pro­vid­ing a cir­cle of sup­port should not be un­der­es­ti­mated. In­stead of wait­ing for peo­ple to open up, friends or fam­ily mem­bers should reach out to them. Some­times, a sim­ple “How are you do­ing? I miss you and I’m here for you. Let’s catch-up” may work won­ders.</p>
