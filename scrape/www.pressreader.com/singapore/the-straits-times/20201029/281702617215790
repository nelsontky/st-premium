    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • The Malaysian gov­ern­ment said it strongly con­demns provoca­tive acts that would de­fame Is­lam, as Mus­lim ac­tivists in the coun­try called for a boy­cott of French prod­ucts amid grow­ing anger glob­ally over the French Pres­i­dent’s re­marks that de­fended the car­toons of the Prophet.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s For­eign Af­fairs Min­is­ter Hishammudd­in Hus­sein said in a state­ment on Tues­day night that as a mat­ter of prin­ci­ple, Malaysia strongly con­demns any in­flam­ma­tory rhetoric and provoca­tive acts that seek to de­fame Is­lam.</p>
    <p>He cited the pop­ulist speeches and pub­li­ca­tion of blas­phe­mous car­i­ca­tures de­pict­ing Prophet Muham­mad as ex­am­ples of ac­tions that are dis­re­spect­ful to­wards the religion and more than two bil­lion Mus­lims all over the world.</p>
    <p>“Malaysia is com­mit­ted to up­hold­ing the free­dom of speech and ex­pres­sion as fun­da­men­tal hu­man rights for as long as these rights are ex­er­cised with re­spect and re­spon­si­bil­ity in order to not in­fringe on or vi­o­late the rights of oth­ers,” Datuk Seri Hishammudd­in said. “In this con­text, to den­i­grate and tar­nish the Prophet and to as­so­ci­ate Is­lam with ter­ror­ism are cer­tainly be­yond the scope of such rights.”</p>
    <p>Umno Youth has also sub­mit­ted a mem­o­ran­dum to the French em­bassy i n Kuala Lumpur ask­ing French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron to re­tract his state­ment and apol­o­gise to Mus­lims.</p>
    <p>Mr Macron found him­self at the cen­tre of a global back­lash, par­tic­u­larly in the Is­lamic world, over a re­mark he made at a me­mo­rial ser­vice for high school teacher Sa­muel Paty, who was mur­dered ear­lier this month in a ter­ror at­tack.</p>
    <p>Mr Paty was be­headed near his school in a north­ern sub­urb of Paris af­ter he showed car­toons of the Prophet dur­ing a class on free</p>
    <p>EX­PRESS FREE­DOM WITH RE­SPECT</p>
    <p>dom of ex­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>In an ap­par­ent de­fence of free speech, Mr Macron said France would not “give up” the car­i­ca­tures and pledged to tackle ex­treme Is­lamism in the coun­try, which out­raged Mus­lim-ma­jor­ity na­tions. Pro­test­ers took to the streets in Bangladesh, Pak­istan, Iraq, Gaza and Turkey as France warned its cit­i­zens abroad to take ex­tra pre­cau­tions.</p>
    <p>“As a demo­cratic and mod­er­ate Is­lamic coun­try with a multi-eth­nic and multi-re­li­gious so­ci­ety, Malaysia con­tin­ues to pro­mote and main­tain har­mo­nious re­la­tions and peace­ful co-ex­is­tence,” said Mr Hishammudd­in.</p>
    <p>The Mus­lim Youth Move­ment of Malaysia (Abim), one of the coun­try’s largest Is­lamic or­gan­i­sa­tions, has also crit­i­cised Mr Macron for mak­ing al­le­ga­tions “with el­e­ments of Is­lam­o­pho­bia by hid­ing be­hind free­dom of ex­pres­sion”.</p>
    <p>“As an or­gan­i­sa­tion that pro­motes re­li­gious har­mony, Abim con­demns the bru­tal mur­der of Sa­muel Paty and, at the same time, strongly crit­i­cises the state­ment of the French Pres­i­dent,” its pres­i­dent Muham­mad Faisal Ab­dul Aziz said in a state­ment. He called on Mus­lims to boy­cott French goods.</p>
    <p>Turk­ish Pres­i­dent Re­cep Tayyip Er­do­gan has also called on Turks to boy­cott French prod­ucts. But Euro­pean govern­ments have come out in sup­port of France, with lead­ers of Ger­many, Italy and the Nether­lands pub­licly ex­press­ing their sol­i­dar­ity with Mr Macron.</p>
    <p>Malaysia is com­mit­ted to up­hold­ing the free­dom of speech and ex­pres­sion as fun­da­men­tal hu­man rights for as long as these rights are ex­er­cised with re­spect and re­spon­si­bil­ity in order to not in­fringe on or vi­o­late the rights of oth­ers...</p>
    <p>In this con­text, to den­i­grate and tar­nish the Prophet and to as­so­ci­ate Is­lam with ter­ror­ism are cer­tainly be­yond the scope of such rights.</p>
