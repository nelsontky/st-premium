    <p>Af­ter re­ceiv­ing dozens of phone calls and text mes­sages from banks tout­ing cheap, un­se­cured and easyto-get con­sumer loans, Mr Eric Zhang vis­ited one of China’s largest lenders in June and bor­rowed 400,000 yuan (S$80,000) at an in­ter­est rate of 4 per cent.</p>
    <p>But there was a catch – he had to sign a let­ter promis­ing the money would not be in­vested in prop­erty or stocks. That did not stop him.</p>
    <p>A few days later, he found a mer­chant who helped him make a fake pur­chase and move the cash to his bro­ker­age ac­count. “I don’t think the bank can track the money and iden­tify its real use,” said Mr Zhang, who works at a Shang­hai-based pri­vate eq­uity firm. “It’s a great trade for me,” he said, af­ter see­ing his fresh stock in­vest­ments surge 6 per cent in one month.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhang’s story is play­ing out across China as re­tail in­vestors em­brace the eu­pho­ria of the big­gest bull run since 2015. Banks and fi­nanc­ing plat­forms are be­ing swept along as pun­ters look for quick cash to bet on the world’s most volatile eq­uity mar­ket.</p>
    <p>It is a dan­ger­ous strat­egy both for al­ready overex­tended house­holds as well as lenders, one that is draw­ing closer scru­tiny from reg­u­la­tors.</p>
    <p>The author­i­ties are also partly to blame. With the econ­omy reel­ing from the pan­demic, pol­i­cy­mak­ers have pumped out liq­uid­ity and eased curbs on shadow bank­ing to back­stop small busi­nesses and strug­gling fam­i­lies. The easy money has fu­elled ar­bi­trage with re­tail in­vestors and cor­po­rates tap­ping the cheaper rates to in­vest in ev­ery­thing from high-yield­ing struc­tured de­posits to wealth man­age­ment prod­ucts to stocks.</p>
    <p>Lever­age has climbed even as mil­lions of Chi­nese lost their jobs dur­ing the pan­demic. House­hold debt rose to a record 59.7 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct in the sec­ond quar­ter, dou­bling from 2012, thanks to a hous­ing boom and the rise of on­line lenders such as Ant Group, which has made it eas­ier for con­sumers to bor­row via its ubiq­ui­tous Ali­pay app.</p>
    <p>The build-up of risk has un­nerved reg­u­la­tors. In a no­tice to banks last month, the Peo­ple’s Bank of China asked lenders to re­port data on con­sumer credit extended jointly with In­ter­net plat­forms to give it a clearer pic­ture of about US$6.6 tril­lion (S$9 tril­lion) in out­stand­ing con­sumer loans.</p>
    <p>Credit extended by fin­tech star­tups, peer-to-peer lenders and many other chan­nels re­main un­reg­u­lated. “Un­like credit card debt, the use of con­sumer loans is harder for banks and reg­u­la­tors to mon­i­tor,” said Mr Chen Hao, a Shang­haibased an­a­lyst with CIB Re­search.</p>
    <p>“Once money goes into the stock mar­ket, it will bring size­able risks to banks given the cur­rent volatil­ity.” Trad­ing has surged, with daily turnover ex­ceed­ing one tril­lion yuan for 17 con­sec­u­tive days.</p>
    <p>Out­stand­ing mar­gin debt on ex­changes has risen at the fastest pace since 2015, to more than 1.4 tril­lion yuan. Un­like in most ma­jor mar­kets, China’s in­di­vid­ual in­vestors ac­count for the lion’s share of lo­cal stock trad­ing and have been prone to ex­treme swings in sen­ti­ment that can have rip­ple ef­fects on the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>State me­dia fu­elled the bull run in a bid to show the world that China was emerging from the virus out­break. Bei­jing has since tried to cool the fer­vour by clamp­ing down on il­licit mar­gin lend­ing plat­forms, but the fear of miss­ing out is ex­treme.</p>
    <p>Mr Josh Xu, a prop­erty agent in Shang­hai, is an ac­tive day trader us­ing money bor­rowed on his credit card and from on­line lenders such as Ant’s Jiebei loan ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Mr Xu, who earns less than 10,000 yuan a month, has made a few thou­sands on his 30,000 yuan in­vest­ment, he said. Ac­cord­ing to loan agree­ments, Ant pro­hibits users from bor­row­ing for in­vest­ments. Jiebei’s clients need to pro­vide a pur­pose for the loan while ap­ply­ing on an app, and vi­o­la­tors could see their cash with­drawn. The loan terms last any­where from three months to two years.</p>
    <p>Still, in a mar­ket where un­se­cured con­sumer lend­ing has ex­panded about 20 per cent a year since 2008 and com­pe­ti­tion is in­tense, bor­row­ers like Mr Xu are able to sidestep such checks.</p>
    <p>The China Bank­ing Reg­u­la­tory Com­mis­sion re­cently re­minded the pub­lic to ex­er­cise caution when us­ing credit cards and not to bor­row short for long-term use. Chair­man Guo Shuqing has cau­tioned that easy ac­cess to fund­ing could spark a re-emer­gence of fi­nan­cial ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Still, such warn­ings are not enough to deter peo­ple like Mr Xu or Mr Zhang. “I know once caught, I will be asked for an im­me­di­ate re­pay­ment and my credit score will take a hit,” Mr Zhang said. “But it’s worth the risk. There are many peo­ple tak­ing ad­van­tage of the loop­holes.”</p>
