    <p>The pace of in­dus­try trans­for­ma­tion in the hard-hit con­struc­tion sec­tor will be quick­ened so that it can be on a stronger foot­ing af­ter the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Na­tional Devel­op­ment Des­mond Lee made the point yes­ter­day in his min­istry’s Ad­den­dum to the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress, in which he out­lined how the Gov­ern­ment will con­tinue to de­velop and in­vest in in­fra­struc­ture even amid the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>To raise pro­duc­tiv­ity in con­struc­tion and re­duce re­liance on man­power, ad­vanced build­ing tech­nolo­gies will be adopted. The Gov­ern­ment will also drive re­search, in­no­va­tion, and dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion across the built en­vi­ron­ment value chain, from con­struc­tion to prop­erty trans­ac­tion ser­vices and fa­cil­i­ties man­age­ment, he said.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal con­struc­tion and con­sul­tancy firms will also get sup­port to help them grow and seize op­por­tu­ni­ties abroad.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee promised to sup­port the hous­ing needs of Sin­ga­pore­ans in the cur­rent cri­sis. The Min­istry of Na­tional Devel­op­ment will help house­holds strug­gling fi­nan­cially by al­low­ing greater flex­i­bil­ity in mort­gage re­pay­ments, for in­stance.</p>
    <p>It is work­ing on min­imis­ing de­lays in the com­ple­tion of Build-To-Or­der flats too.</p>
    <p>“We will also mon­i­tor the hous­ing mar­ket closely and take mea­sures where needed to keep it sta­ble and sus­tain­able.”</p>
    <p>He fur­ther said his min­istry will reg­u­larly re­view hous­ing plans and poli­cies to sup­port var­i­ous groups, in­clud­ing multi-gen­er­a­tional fam­i­lies, sin­gles and sin­gle par­ents.</p>
    <p>Schemes have also been en­hanced to help se­niors tap their flat’s value to help them with re­tire­ment ad­e­quacy.</p>
    <p>Th­ese schemes in­clude the Vol­un­tary Early Re­de­vel­op­ment Scheme (Vers), which gives own­ers of age­ing HDB flats a chance to sell their homes to the Gov­ern­ment. Vers, which helps re­ju­ve­nate older towns too, will be a “ma­jor and com­plex undertakin­g”, the min­is­ter said.</p>
    <p>An­other ef­fort is to de­sign HDB towns and es­tates to be more en­vi­ron­men­tally sus­tain­able, and to bet­ter sup­port res­i­dents’ well-be­ing. By 2030, the min­istry plans to re­duce en­ergy con­sump­tion by 15 per cent through such ini­tia­tives as in­stalling rooftop so­lar pan­els and smart LED light­ing.</p>
    <p>Na­ture will be in­te­grated in ur­ban ar­eas and path­ways, and build­ing sustainabi­lity stan­dards will be raised.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans can also have a big­ger say in how they want their com­mu­ni­ties and liv­ing en­vi­ron­ments to look like, with plans in the works to deepen com­mu­nity en­gage­ment and seek ideas from cit­i­zens as part of the Sin­ga­pore To­gether move­ment, said Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>He added that the Gov­ern­ment will con­tinue to part­ner the com­mu­nity and in­dus­try, as it pushes ahead to lay the ground­work for ma­jor projects, such as the re­ju­ve­na­tion ef­forts for the Rail Cor­ri­dor and Cen­tral Busi­ness District.</p>
    <p>Longer-term projects, such as the devel­op­ment of the Greater South­ern Waterfront and re­de­vel­op­ment of the Paya Le­bar Air­base site, will pro­vide more op­por­tu­ni­ties for fu­ture gen­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“Through shared neigh­bour­hoods, pub­lic spa­ces and ex­pe­ri­ences, Sin­ga­pore­ans can build stronger bonds and a more united com­mu­nity,” said Mr Lee.</p>
