    <p>A new re­search fa­cil­ity will be set up by the year end to drive ed­u­ca­tion, re­search and en­trepreneur­ship in dig­i­tal fi­nance in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>The Asian In­sti­tute of Dig­i­tal Fi­nance (AIDF) is be­ing jointly de­vel­oped by the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS), Na­tional Re­search Foun­da­tion (NRF) and the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS).</p>
    <p>The three agen­cies, in an­nounc­ing the move yes­ter­day, said the in­sti­tute will be based at NUS’ Kent Ridge cam­pus.</p>
    <p>It will of­fer a mas­ter’s pro­gramme and award schol­ar­ships to stu­dents to do fur­ther re­search at PhD level, as well as train post-doc­toral fel­lows in the ar­eas of dig­i­tal fi­nance and fin­tech.</p>
    <p>The aim is to pro­duce more lead­ers in fin­tech in Sin­ga­pore and across the re­gion to help drive growth in the sec­tor, the three part­ners said in state­ment.</p>
    <p>MAS man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Ravi Menon said: “AIDF will be an im­por­tant ad­di­tion to Sin­ga­pore’s rich and vi­brant fin­tech ecosys­tem. Through ap­plied re­search and ac­tive col­lab­o­ra­tion with in­dus­try, AIDF will help to build strong ca­pa­bil­i­ties in dig­i­tal fi­nance and fin­tech.”</p>
    <p>The in­sti­tute will bring to­gether deep ex­per­tise in fi­nance and tech­nol­ogy, in­clud­ing in ar­eas such as pay­ments, credit and lend­ing, fi­nan­cial ad­vi­sory and wealth man­age­ment, as well as re­tail and cor­po­rate bank­ing. It will also en­com­pass dig­i­tal ar­chi­tec­ture, big data, cloud com­put­ing and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence.</p>
    <p>The fac­ulty will be led by Jar­dine Cy­cle & Car­riage Pro­fes­sor of Fi­nance Duan Jin-Chuan from NUS Busi­ness School. There will also be a steer­ing group com­pris­ing NUS provost and se­nior deputy pres­i­dent Ho Teck Hua, MAS chief fin­tech of­fi­cer Sop­nendu Mo­hanty and lead­ers from the fi­nance and tech­nol­ogy in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>They will help de­sign the cur­ricu­lum and align the re­search di­rec­tion with pri­or­i­ties in Sin­ga­pore and the re­gion.</p>
    <p>The in­sti­tute will un­der­take re­search projects cov­er­ing fun­da­men­tal dig­i­tal in­fra­struc­ture, ways of im­prov­ing busi­ness pro­cesses and ad­dress is­sues posed by fraud and chal­lenges in anti-money laun­der­ing ef­forts. It will also de­velop sus­tain­able and re­silient fi­nan­cial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>NUS pres­i­dent Tan Eng Chye said: “NUS’ thought lead­er­ship in dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies, such as ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, blockchain, cloud com­put­ing and data sci­ence, makes us per­fectly po­si­tioned to ad­dress the chal­lenges of the dig­i­tal econ­omy in Sin­ga­pore and other parts of the world.”</p>
    <p>Be­sides re­search, the in­sti­tute will also have an in­cu­ba­tor pro­gramme for en­trepreneur­s to turn projects into mar­ket-ready prod­ucts and ser­vices. There could also be col­lab­o­ra­tion with the in­dus­try to pro­vide men­tor­ship.</p>
    <p>Said NRF chief ex­ec­u­tive Low Teck Seng: “AIDF will help... com­mer­cialise high-im­pact re­search ideas to de­liver prac­ti­cal and in­no­va­tive so­lu­tions for the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“It will lever­age NUS’ re­gional and global net­works in­volv­ing lo­cal and for­eign uni­ver­si­ties and re­search in­sti­tutes to gen­er­ate and test-bed fin­tech so­lu­tions for the Asian mar­kets.</p>
    <p>“More im­por­tantly, AIDF will also groom next-gen­er­a­tion fin­tech lead­ers that will strengthen Sin­ga­pore’s smart na­tion core.”</p>
    <p>IN­STI­TUTE’S VI­SION</p>
    <p>AIDF will help... com­mer­cialise high-im­pact re­search ideas to de­liver prac­ti­cal and in­no­va­tive so­lu­tions for the mar­ket... More im­por­tantly, AIDF will also groom next-gen­er­a­tion fin­tech lead­ers that will strengthen Sin­ga­pore’s ’’ smart na­tion core.</p>
    <p>NA­TIONAL RE­SEARCH FOUN­DA­TION CHIEF EX­EC­U­TIVE LOW TECK SENG</p>
    <p>We ex­pect banks’ profit to mod­er­ate over the near term due mainly to higher pro­vi­sion­ing costs and low in­ter­est rates.</p>
