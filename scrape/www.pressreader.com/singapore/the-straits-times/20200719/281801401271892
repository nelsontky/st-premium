    <p>A new $1 mil­lion fund aimed at ad­dress­ing men­tal health is­sues among young peo­ple here will set aside a to­tal of $100,000 for peer­run ini­tia­tives.</p>
    <p>The Musim Mas BlueS­tar* Fund was launched yes­ter­day from the $1 mil­lion do­na­tion by palm oil com­pany Musim Mas Hold­ings at the 12th Global Youth Lead­ers Sum­mit, which was held vir­tu­ally this year due to Covid-19 re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Musim Mas Hold­ings is col­lab­o­rat­ing with phil­an­thropic or­gan­i­sa­tion The Ma­ju­rity Trust to pro­vide grants to non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tions as well as the young peo­ple them­selves to sup­port pro­grammes that help those who face men­tal health is­sues.</p>
    <p>Ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of The Ma­ju­rity Trust Martin Tan said: “The best peo­ple to reach out to young peo­ple fac­ing men­tal health is­sues are the young peo­ple them­selves.”</p>
    <p>He added: “BlueS­tar* fol­lows the theme ‘You Mat­ter’ and this ‘you’ can refer to both those suf­fer­ing from these is­sues as well as the friends that are there when they are needed the most.”</p>
    <p>While de­tails are still be­ing ironed out, for now, the grant is aimed at cater­ing to those aged be­tween 10 and 16. Each project can re­ceive up to $5,000.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment Des­mond Lee said at the launch: “Young peo­ple are deeply con­cerned with psy­cho­log­i­cal and men­tal well-be­ing... and many (of them) some­times feel a bit help­less as to what they can or can­not do.</p>
    <p>“They want to be armed with the skill sets and the knowl­edge, and more im­por­tantly, to be em­pow­ered to do some­thing, so (the fund) will pro­vide sup­port and fund­ing.”</p>
    <p>For Musim Mas Hold­ings chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer and ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Alvin Lim, the de­ci­sion to do­nate $1 mil­lion to this cause was a per­sonal one. When he was 19, one of his friends com­mit­ted sui­cide, ig­nit­ing his pas­sion to re­move the stigma around dis­cussing men­tal health is­sues.</p>
    <p>He said: “In Sin­ga­pore, we like to be very com­pet­i­tive and talk about how good our kids are, so we don’t want to talk about these is­sues.</p>
    <p>“But it’s pre­cisely is­sues like these we should be fac­ing so we can tell our kids that they are not alone and that there is hope.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said there is a greater ur­gency to pro­vide sup­port for men­tal health is­sues, cit­ing a poll by Na­tional Youth Council of 1,500 peo­ple aged be­tween 16 and 34 which showed that nearly half of the re­spon­dents felt their men­tal health was wors­ened amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Aside from projects that tackle men­tal health is­sues, a por­tion of the fund will go to a sep­a­rate grant for pro­grammes run by non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tions. A third por­tion will be used to sup­port research, pub­lic aware­ness ini­tia­tives and in­ter­ven­tion and ed­u­ca­tional pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>Ms Mur­salina Is­mail, 22, who heads the man­power de­part­ment at so­cial de­vel­op­ment en­ter­prise Fu­tuReady Asia, shared her ex­pe­ri­ence on young peo­ple fac­ing men­tal health is­sues.</p>
    <p>She said: “Some­times they don’t have strong fam­ily sup­port at home, so we have to let them know that they mat­ter, re­gard­less of what they are go­ing through in life.”</p>
