    <p>More than 4,700 Sin­ga­pore­ans voted over­seas in the July 10 Gen­eral Elec­tion, largely fol­low­ing pat­terns sim­i­lar to cit­i­zens who voted lo­cally.</p>
    <p>A few ex­cep­tions were seen in a num­ber of hotly con­tested con­stituen­cies, where over­seas vot­ers sup­ported the team that had lost.</p>
    <p>In Sengkang GRC, which was won by the Work­ers’ Party (WP) with 52.1 per cent of the votes, 105 over­seas vot­ers sup­ported the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) team in­stead, while another 81 vot­ers chose the WP team.</p>
    <p>In East Coast GRC, which was also con­tested by the WP, slightly more over­seas vot­ers sup­ported the WP over the PAP team that even­tu­ally won. The PAP team had 135 votes from cit­i­zens abroad, while the WP team had 147 votes.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, more over­seas vot­ers sup­ported the Sin­ga­pore Demo­cratic Party’s Pro­fes­sor Paul Tam­byah in Bukit Pan­jang SMC and the Progress Sin­ga­pore Party (PSP) team that con­tested West Coast GRC over the PAP slates.</p>
    <p>Prof Tam­byah gar­nered 20 votes while the PAP’s Mr Liang Eng Hwa re­ceived 15. The PSP’s West Coast team, led by party chief Tan Cheng Bock, had 125 votes over the PAP team’s 113 votes.</p>
    <p>The PAP can­di­dates re­ceived strong sup­port in a few other con­stituen­cies, such as Hong Kah North SMC, where Dr Amy Khor re­ceived 14 votes against the PSP’s Ms Gi­gene Wong, who had five.</p>
    <p>Ms Sun Xuel­ing of the PAP re­ceived 18 votes in Pung­gol West SMC against the WP’s Ms Tan Chen Chen, who re­ceived five.</p>
    <p>Yio Chu Kang SMC vot­ers were ex­actly split be­tween the PAP’s Mr Yip Hon Weng and the PSP’s Ms Kayla Low, with 19 votes each.</p>
    <p>In­de­pen­dent can­di­date Cheang Peng Wah re­ceived one vote in Pi­o­neer SMC, PSP’s Mr Lim Cher Hong had four, and the PAP’s Mr Pa­trick Tay had 22, mak­ing it more than 80 per cent of the vote share.</p>
    <p>There were 50 re­jected votes among the bal­lots cast over­seas.</p>
    <p>The re­sults of the July 10 elec­tion were al­ready de­cided be­fore the over­seas votes were counted, as the mar­gins of vic­tory for all 31 con­stituen­cies were greater than the to­tal num­ber of over­seas reg­is­tered</p>
