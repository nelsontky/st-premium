    <p>A sus­tain­able source of milk cul­tured from cells and a plat­form to lower the costs of mi­grant worker re­cruit­ment are two di­verse tech­driven ideas bub­bling in Sin­ga­pore’s start-up ecosys­tem.</p>
    <p>TurtleTree Labs, a start-up fo­cus­ing on de­vel­op­ing cell-based milk, has been work­ing on op­ti­mis­ing a 5-litre pro­duc­tion fa­cil­ity and in­tends to have a pi­lot plant in Sin­ga­pore by the mid­dle of next year.</p>
    <p>Its chief strate­gist Max Rye said: “We don’t have to be re­stricted to places (with farms) like New Zealand... we don’t have to have cows around. All you need is a biotech en­vi­ron­ment, and (Sin­ga­pore) is per­fect for it.”</p>
    <p>TurtleTree was awarded $1 mil­lion in fund­ing by Te­masek Foun­da­tion last month, after win­ning this year’s edi­tion of The Live­abil­ity Chal­lenge, which seeks so­lu­tions to some of the big­gest prob­lems faced by cities in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>The com­pany, which was formed last year, has more than 20 sci­en­tists and engi­neers and around 30 em­ploy­ees in to­tal.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 has high­lighted the need for food se­cu­rity and the fragility of our global lo­gis­tics, global food sup­ply sys­tem,” said chief ex­ec­u­tive Fen­gru Lin, not­ing that the firm has also been able to tap gov­ern­ment sup­port schemes and grants in its growth, such as the Startup SG Founder pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The firm aims to have its first li­cens­ing agree­ments signed by the sec­ond quar­ter of next year, but it would take an­other 18 months or so of work­ing with part­ners to de­liver a prod­uct that can be taken to mar­ket, said Mr Rye.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, for­eign worker re­cruit­ment plat­form Sama has been match­ing mi­grant work­ers here to new em­ploy­ment, be it within the same sec­tor or a new in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“For now, we are fo­cus­ing on work­ers who are al­ready (in Sin­ga­pore), and the ma­jor­ity of these trans­fers are work­ers who have been let go by their com­pa­nies,” said co-founder Kir­tan Pa­tel, not­ing that some work­ers are also seek­ing new jobs in dif­fer­ent sec­tors.</p>
    <p>While its main fo­cus is on work­ers in con­struc­tion, Sama has also been en­gag­ing work­ers and em­ploy­ers in other sec­tors which are de­pen­dent on for­eign labour, such as man­u­fac­tur­ing and the marine in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The plat­form also has re­mit­tance and salary pay­ment fea­tures, and al­lows em­ploy­ers to check on the health sta­tus of their work­ers.</p>
    <p>The firm’s long-term play is on re­cruit­ment and giv­ing work­ers more em­ploy­ment op­tions, while low­er­ing the costs for them to work over­seas.</p>
    <p>“Many of these work­ers never re­ally have much of a choice or vis­i­bil­ity of what job (op­tions there are), but we hope to give them that,” said Mr Pa­tel.</p>
