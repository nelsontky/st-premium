    <p>The up­com­ing cruises to nowhere will be a safer al­ter­na­tive to stay­ca­tions on land at a com­pa­ra­ble price, ac­cord­ing to the two cruise lines ap­proved to go ahead with sail­ings in time for the year-end hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>Gent­ing Cruise Lines’ World Dream will be­gin sail­ing on Nov 6, while Royal Caribbean’s Quan­tum of the Seas ship will start in De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>Gent­ing Cruise Lines will of­fer two- and three-night cruises, start­ing at $359 and $599, re­spec­tively. An ad­di­tional charge of $60 will ap­ply for a manda­tory nasal swab test for pas­sen­gers aged 13 and above, to be done on the day of de­par­ture.</p>
    <p>Royal Caribbean will be of­fer­ing three- and four-night cruises, start­ing at $374 and $509, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>While there will be no self-ser­vice buf­fets, most ac­tiv­i­ties on the ships will pro­ceed as nor­mal, the cruise lines said.</p>
    <p>Ms Angie Stephen, Royal Caribbean Group’s Asia-Pa­cific man­ag­ing di­rec­tor, told The Straits Times that the prices for its cruises are “right in line with, or if not even slightly less” than those for ho­tel stay­ca­tion pack­ages on shore.</p>
    <p>And while con­sumers may worry about the pos­si­bil­ity of an out­break on board af­ter one on the Di­a­mond Princess ship made headlines this year, these cruises are safer than stay­ca­tions on shore, she said.</p>
    <p>“It is im­por­tant for peo­ple to re­alise that the Di­a­mond Princess sit­u­a­tion hap­pened in Jan­uary and Fe­bru­ary, when the world had no idea about the im­pact of Covid-19, let alone how to con­trol it,” she added.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to Sin­ga­pore’s safe man­age­ment rules, ap­proved sail­ings will have ad­di­tional mea­sures such as pre-board­ing screen­ing, she said. “When you think about it, a cruise is a very safe bub­ble.”</p>
    <p>If a case is con­firmed on board, Royal Caribbean will use Blue­tooth con­tact trac­ing to iso­late those the in­fected per­son came into close con­tact with, said Ms Stephen.</p>
    <p>Mr Michael Goh, head of in­ter­na­tional sales at Gent­ing Cruise Lines and pres­i­dent of Dream Cruises, said it has been op­er­at­ing do­mes­tic cruises in Tai­wan with­out in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Two of its ships were also used to house re­cov­ered for­eign work­ers here ear­lier this year, and the lessons have proven use­ful for crew train­ing, he added.</p>
    <p>The de­sign of its ves­sels en­sures that there is no re­cir­cu­la­tion of air on board, Mr Goh said, adding that con­sumer education is key to re­build­ing con­fi­dence in cruises.</p>
    <p>To pro­vide peace of mind, both cruise lines are of­fer­ing credit to­wards a fu­ture sail­ing to guests who test pos­i­tive for Covid-19 be­fore board­ing. Royal Caribbean will also cover up to $25,000 per per­son for Covid-19-re­lated costs, in­clud­ing on-board med­i­cal costs, any re­quired quar­an­tine and travel home.</p>
    <p>Dr Wong King Yin, a mar­ket­ing lec­turer at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity, said the take-up rate for such cruises would be dif­fi­cult to pre­dict.</p>
    <p>While cruises tra­di­tion­ally at­tract older crowds, op­er­a­tors may use the op­por­tu­nity to tar­get younger trav­ellers who have not con­sid­ered cruise hol­i­days be­fore, she added.</p>
    <p>“This group of peo­ple may be less risk averse and don’t mind try­ing new ex­pe­ri­ences,” she said.</p>
    <p>SAFETY CON­CERNS</p>
    <p>It is im­por­tant for peo­ple to re­alise that the Di­a­mond Princess sit­u­a­tion hap­pened in Jan­uary and Fe­bru­ary, when the world had no idea about the im­pact of Covid-19, let alone how to con­trol it... When you think about it, a cruise is a very safe bub­ble.</p>
    <p>MS ANGIE STEPHEN,</p>
    <p>Royal Caribbean Group’s Asia-Pa­cific man­ag­ing di­rec­tor, on con­cerns af­ter a Covid-19 out­break took place on the Di­a­mond Princess ship ear­lier this year. She said safety mea­sures, such as pre-board­ing screen­ing, will be in place.</p>
