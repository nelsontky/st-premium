    <p>LONDON • As­ton Villa are the only team left in the Pre­mier League with a 100 per cent record.</p>
    <p>Last sea­son, they spent over £100 mil­lion (S$176.4 mil­lion) on a host of trans­fers, but their scat­ter­gun ap­proach nearly cost them their English top flight sta­tus, with the Vil­lans end­ing the term in 17th place.</p>
    <p>But with a full sea­son un­der their belt, the squad have started to gel and al­lied with a raft of shrewder ac­qui­si­tions this trans­fer win­dow, Villa ap­pear to be a trans­formed club four games into the new campaign.</p>
    <p>Ross Barkley was deemed sur­plus to re­quire­ments at Chelsea so manager Dean Smith snapped him up on a sea­son-long loan last month. Along with new boys Emil­iano Martinez, Ol­lie Watkins and Matty Cash, the Eng­land mid­fielder has been a key part of Villa’s best start to a sea­son since 1930-31.</p>
    <p>Barkley lashed in the winner – his se­cond goal in as many games – in added time at Le­ices­ter on Sun­day to seal a 1-0 win and they now sit se­cond in the ta­ble, a point be­hind lead­ers Ever­ton (13) but with a game in hand.</p>
    <p>Af­ter avoid­ing rel­e­ga­tion on the fi­nal day of last sea­son, Smith is de­lighted with how Barkley, like his other re­cruits, has im­proved the qual­ity of his team.</p>
    <p>“Ross showed why he’s a very cov­eted player with a fin­ish we’ve seen him do a number of times,” said the Villa boss.</p>
    <p>“He’s a high-cal­i­bre player. I sold him the project here and told him I’ll get him in the Euro squad (for Eng­land) and he’s go­ing to try and help us win foot­ball games. He’s cer­tainly done that in his first cou­ple.”</p>
    <p>Barkley re­paid the com­pli­ments af­ter mak­ing just 28 Pre­mier League starts in a Chelsea shirt af­ter ar­riv­ing from Ever­ton in 2018.</p>
    <p>“The manager has given me the plat­form to play and I am ex­cited and look­ing for­ward to ev­ery game,” said the 26-year-old.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Smith, who guided Villa to the League Cup fi­nal last sea­son, in­sisted that he would try to keep his play­ers’ feet on the ground de­spite their fly­ing start.</p>
    <p>“I said to the play­ers at the start of the sea­son we’re all about try­ing to make his­tory,” he said. “We done it in my first sea­son, win­ning those 10 games (in the Cham­pi­onship to gain pro­mo­tion) and we stayed up last sea­son. It’s im­por­tant we keep our feet on the ground and stay hum­ble.”</p>
