    <p>TAIPEI • From a bu­colic ru­ral gro­cery shop to fic­tional bat­tle­fields, Tai­wanese ar­ti­sans are metic­u­lously hand­craft­ing minia­ture worlds that fuse re­al­ity and fan­tasy.</p>
    <p>When he is not de­sign­ing in­te­ri­ors, Mr Hank Cheng, 51, can usu­ally be found in his stu­dio con­jur­ing tiny but in­tri­cately de­tailed scenes.</p>
    <p>“I like to try to make any­thing, whether it’s clean, old or dirty, to let my imag­i­na­tion run wild,” he said.</p>
    <p>His cre­ations range from a replica of a 40-year-old gro­cery store in cen­tral Tai­wan that caught his eye to an imag­i­nary “se­cret main­te­nance base” for a le­gion of Min­ions made from a dis­carded Min­ion­shaped cookie box he re­cy­cled.</p>
    <p>“When peo­ple ask me is there any­thing I can’t make, I joke: ‘Only air and sun­shine’,” he said.</p>
    <p>In his youth, Mr Cheng stud­ied il­lus­tra­tion in Ja­pan, where minia­tures and dio­ra­mas have long been pop­u­lar. But he started mak­ing minia­tures only five years ago, af­ter spot­ting a photo of a Ja­panese artist’s work that was so re­al­is­tic, he thought it was real at first sight.</p>
    <p>One of his most de­tailed pieces is a pain­stak­ingly ac­cu­rate model of an old Ja­panese restau­rant sell­ing eel rice dishes – com­plete with smokestain­ed kitchen and greasy floor – which won awards at a Ja­panese com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>An­other favourite de­sign is a run­down bar with rowdy pa­trons, graf­fiti and a back al­ley lit­tered with garbage so re­al­is­tic, he hopes view­ers can “smell the odour” just by look­ing at it.</p>
    <p>“I hope each of my cre­ations tells a story to get peo­ple in­ter­ested, and does not just look pretty or re­al­is­tic,” said Mr Cheng, who has also pub­lished a book on mak­ing minia­tures and held solo ex­hi­bi­tions.</p>
    <p>“I hope it shows some warmth and traces of real things.”</p>
    <p>MINIA­TURE THER­APY</p>
    <p>Ms Hikari Yang, 39, started mak­ing minia­tures at a time in her life when she was feel­ing low.</p>
    <p>She re­called that by the time she com­pleted her first work – a Ja­panese-style town of her dreams – she felt “healed” by the process and had for­got­ten about her trou­bles.</p>
    <p>She set up the stu­dio FM Dio­ra­mas in Taoyuan, north­ern Tai­wan, in late 2016 with sev­eral part­ners, main­tain­ing a day job un­til she was re­cently able to switch to mak­ing mod­els full time.</p>
    <p>The group’s port­fo­lio is filled with de­tailed mod­els fea­tur­ing real-life or sci-fi scenes that, on av­er­age,</p>
    <p>take eight to nine months to com­plete.</p>
    <p>Her stu­dio has cul­ti­vated a grow­ing fol­low­ing by giv­ing minia­ture­mak­ing classes across Tai­wan and also cre­ates minia­tures that are shipped around the world.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple come to our classes to learn to make what we call ‘heal­ing lit­tle items’ like a tree in a park. Mak­ing the minia­ture from scratch pro­vides a re­lease of the stress in their busy lives,” Ms Yang said.</p>
    <p>Her part­ner Chen Shih-jen, 45, said build­ing dio­ra­mas helps take the edge off his full-time com­puter pro­gram­ming job.</p>
    <p>Com­mis­sions are var­ied.</p>
    <p>One cus­tom or­der Mr Chen re</p>
    <p>ceived from a gov­ern­ment agency was to recre­ate a minia­ture tra­di­tional house of the Seediq, one of Tai­wan’s many in­dige­nous tribes.</p>
    <p>An­other came from a cou­ple who wanted a model of the restau­rant they had their first date in.</p>
    <p>A more elab­o­rate dio­rama he built for his own col­lec­tion con­tains an en­vi­ron­men­tal mes­sage.</p>
    <p>“The work de­picts how peo­ple would live when the land dis­ap­pears,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Cli­mate change and global warm­ing are hap­pen­ing and I hope peo­ple will cher­ish the present. What we see as nor­mal re­sources are lim­ited and could be gone one day.”</p>
