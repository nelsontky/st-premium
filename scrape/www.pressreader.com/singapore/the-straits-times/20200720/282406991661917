    <p>LONDON • On the touch­line, a mem­ber of the Leeds coach­ing staff leapt into the arms of de­fender Stu­art Dal­las, hang­ing onto him for dear life.</p>
    <p>An­drea Radriz­zani, the team’s owner and founder of ca­ble net­work Eleven Sports, was stand­ing by the tun­nel, em­brac­ing ev­ery player who ap­proached him.</p>
    <p>In the stands, Vic­tor Orta, the tech­ni­cal di­rec­tor, was pump­ing his arms and scream­ing into the sky. Leeds were al­most there. For 16 years, the club have been yearn­ing to re­gain their place in the Premier League: a decade and a half of hu­mil­i­a­tion, chaos, false dawns and even falser prophets in the per­pet­ual sun­sets of English foot­ball’s sec­ond and third tiers.</p>
    <p>Then a fraught, nar­row vic­tory against Barns­ley last Thurs­day had brought them to the cusp: not math­e­mat­i­cally, not of­fi­cially, not quite, not yet, but spir­i­tu­ally, nearly. Amid all the emo­tion, the ar­chi­tect of Leeds’ ex­o­dus from the wilder­ness, their ec­cen­tric Ar­gen­tinian coach Marcelo Bielsa, walked across to his Barns­ley coun­ter­part, Ger­hard Stru­ber.</p>
    <p>Bielsa wanted to tell Stru­ber, with that slightly awk­ward, stu­dious air he has, how im­pressed he had been by his team, how much he ad­mired his work.</p>
    <p>“He found the right words for me,” Stru­ber said. Bielsa, whose ar­rival in June 2018 has trans­formed the fab­ric of the club, was not con­cerned with what came next. If ei­ther of Leeds’ clos­est ri­vals, West Bromwich Al­bion and Brent­ford, dropped so much as a point over the week­end, that would be it, and Leeds would be pro­moted.</p>
    <p>Bielsa did not, he said, in­tend on watch­ing ei­ther match. He did not find day­dream­ing, hop­ing for oth­ers to stut­ter so that he might be a Premier League man­ager, “con­ve­nient”.</p>
    <p>“The sit­u­a­tion is not re­solved,” he said.</p>
    <p>He would in­stead do what he al­ways does: pore over op­po­si­tion anal­y­sis and scout­ing re­ports and pre­pare train­ing pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>Barely 24 hours later, the spir­i­tual be­came math­e­mat­i­cal. West Brom lost at Hud­der­s­field. Leeds, after 16 long years, were up.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of fans de­scended quickly on El­land Road, burn­ing flares and set­ting off fire­works and drap­ing scarves over the statue of Billy Brem­ner, the club’s great­est idol.</p>
    <p>In one of the sta­dium suites high above, the team – gath­ered to­gether to watch their mo­ment of as­cen­sion – danced and sang with them. Bielsa, how­ever, was at home in Wetherby, a quiet mar­ket town 20 minutes out­side the city.</p>
    <p>A few of his neigh­bours turned up to con­grat­u­late him. “Thank you,” he said. “I don’t speak English, but thank you.” They smiled. “You are God,” one replied. Leeds has long been a city in search of a defin­ing iden­tity, some sort of call­ing card.</p>
    <p>At times, foot­ball has pro­vided it: In the 1960s and 70s, the ti­tle-win­ning era be­fore “The Damned United” days of Brian Clough’s dis­as­trous and brief ten­ure; and again at the turn of the cen­tury, when its thrilling team, fu­elled by youth and debt, reached the 2001 semi-fi­nals of the Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>That was the last time they were in Euro­pean foot­ball’s premier com­pe­ti­tion, with rel­e­ga­tion oc­cur­ring just three years later.</p>
    <p>Since then, for much of the coun­try, the as­so­ci­a­tion of Leeds and foot­ball has been a neg­a­tive one.</p>
    <p>“Do­ing a Leeds” has en­tered the sport’s lex­i­con, a cau­tion­ary tale about the dan­gers of spend­ing more than you earn, of liv­ing be­yond your means, of the hubris that comes from ex­cess.</p>
    <p>For a decade and a half, that has been Leeds’ sport­ing iden­tity, but in the years in the wilder­ness, the sup­port they have re­ceived has been fo­cused on one thing: see­ing the club re­turn to the Premier League, their promised land.</p>
    <p>The club’s time away from the elite has given the team a pur­pose, an iden­tity, one that the whole city has bought into: Leeds not as the team and the city that fell, but the team and the place that rose again.</p>
