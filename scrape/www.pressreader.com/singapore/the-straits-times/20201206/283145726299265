    <p>Q What has been your big­gest in­vest­ing mis­take?</p>
    <p>A I think the big­gest les­son I have learnt in in­vest­ment is find­ing good peo­ple to col­lab­o­rate and work with. Find­ing good peo­ple to part­ner in busi­ness can avert dis­as­ter even in bad times.</p>
    <p>My worst busi­ness in­vest­ment has to be the time I was too ea­ger to in­vest in a trend­ing busi­ness that did not have strong longterm fi­nan­cial fun­da­men­tals.</p>
    <p>I also ap­plied long-term in­vest­ment meth­ods to this busi­ness.</p>
    <p>In hind­sight, it might have seemed ob­vi­ous that I was mak­ing a mis­take.</p>
    <p>But at the time, the pos­i­tive out­look for the busi­ness, sup­ported by an op­ti­mistic mar­ket, de­railed my best in­ten­tions to steer clear of risk and seize only good op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>I ended up los­ing both money and time, both of which I have since learnt to bet­ter ap­pre­ci­ate.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, af­ter that ex­pe­ri­ence, I have been more pa­tient and have en­gaged peo­ple on my team and in­dus­try ex­perts who know bet­ter.</p>
    <p>This helps me to more ac­cu­rately iden­tify which busi­nesses are truly vi­able for the fore­see­able fu­ture, as op­posed to those that rely on trends that are a pass­ing fad.</p>
    <p>Q And your best in­vest­ment?</p>
    <p>A The best in­vest­ment is hav­ing good peo­ple around me.</p>
    <p>I find that sur­round­ing my­self with the right peo­ple has al­ways led me to pos­i­tive out­comes.</p>
    <p>Trust­ing in the right peo­ple is and al­ways will be some­thing I con­stantly look out for.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, work­ing with peo­ple who don’t share the same vi­sion and can’t be trusted will def­i­nitely bring any great idea down.</p>
