    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans have hailed the news yes­ter­day that the coun­try’s hawker cul­ture has been in­scribed on the Unesco in­tan­gi­ble her­itage list, with some hawk­ers hop­ing it will bring more tourists to their stalls and keep the sec­tor alive and thriv­ing af­ter the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The his­toric mo­ment has been hotly an­tic­i­pated for nearly three years, and around 10pm yes­ter­day, the news was an­nounced by the in­ter­gov­ern­men­tal com­mit­tee in charge of the fi­nal ver­dict.</p>
    <p>Hawker trainee Lim Min Jie, 34, said the in­scrip­tion would put Sin­ga­pore’s hawker cul­ture on the world food map.</p>
    <p>“Once the Covid-19 pan­demic has passed, peo­ple are go­ing to start trav­el­ling and through this in­scrip­tion, more might visit Sin­ga­pore to dis­cover our hawker cul­ture. It will def­i­nitely ben­e­fit us in the long run.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lim said ex­pe­ri­enced hawk­ers have taught him new skills and he now bet­ter un­der­stands the rel­e­vant prac­tices.</p>
    <p>“The hawker cul­ture is not alien to me as I have seen hawk­ers in my fam­ily cook­ing since I was young. My men­tors helped me un­der­stand how to ad­dress such as­pects as sup­ply, fi­nance and man­power,” he added.</p>
    <p>A two-minute video that was aired af­ter the an­nounce­ment fea­tured hawk­ers and pa­trons speak­ing about what hawker cul­ture meant to them.</p>
    <p>Ms Kar­ney Ngai, chair­man of Yuhua Vil­lage Mar­ket and Food Cen­tre, said: “Hawker cen­tres are more than just an eat­ing space. They are com­mu­nity din­ing rooms where Sin­ga­pore­ans from all walks of life come to­gether.”</p>
    <p>An­other hawker named Mrs Sheikh, who runs O’Braim Ex­press at Our Tampines Hub Hawker Cen­tre, said: “As a young hawker who is pas­sion­ate about hawker cul­ture, I hope this Unesco recog­ni­tion in­spires oth­ers to join me in car­ry­ing on this im­por­tant part of Sin­ga­pore’s cul­tural her­itage.”</p>
    <p>Dr Jack Lee, pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore Her­itage So­ci­ety and a mem­ber of the nom­i­na­tion com­mit­tee, said the in­scrip­tion high­lights the value of the hawker trade in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“Al­though hawker cul­ture is some­thing we may take for granted, the in­scrip­tion helps us recog­nise that hawker cul­ture in Sin­ga­pore is valu­able and wor­thy of recog­ni­tion.</p>
    <p>“I’m hop­ing this will spur peo­ple to think about join­ing the in­dus­try and con­sider its sus­tain­abil­ity in the fu­ture,” he added.</p>
    <p>CIMB Pri­vate Bank­ing econ­o­mist Song Seng Wun, who reg­u­larly ref­er­ences lo­cal food in his so­cial me­dia posts on the state of the economy, said the recog­ni­tion could help in brand­ing and mon­eti­sa­tion ef­forts for hawk­ers.</p>
    <p>While hawker cul­ture can be ad­ver­tised in a global con­text as a unique as­pect of Sin­ga­pore, he said, it was im­por­tant to con­sider how lo­cals could play their part in boost­ing the sec­tor amid a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He added: “Hawker cul­ture has gained trac­tion even prior to this recog­ni­tion, and it is im­por­tant to con­sider how this can be a vi­able ca­reer al­ter­na­tive and lo­cals can ap­pre­ci­ate pay­ing for it as an in­tan­gi­ble cul­tural as­set.”</p>
    <p>TRIBUTE TO HAWK­ERS</p>
    <p>Great news – Sin­ga­pore Hawker Cul­ture has been in­scribed on the Unesco Rep­re­sen­ta­tive List of In­tan­gi­ble Cul­tural Her­itage of Hu­man­ity!</p>
    <p>Many have worked very hard to get our Hawker Cul­ture in­scribed on that list. Thank you all – it has been a long but fruit­ful jour­ney.</p>
    <p>The big­gest thanks must go to the gen­er­a­tions of hawk­ers for nour­ish­ing a na­tion’s stom­ach and spir­its. This recog­ni­tion would not have come with­out their sweat, toil and ded­i­ca­tion to their pro­fes­sion.</p>
