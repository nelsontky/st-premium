    <p>Bi­cy­cles share foot­paths with pedes­tri­ans. We can­not dis­count the dan­gers posed by cy­clists, be­cause a bi­cy­cle rid­den at fast speeds can maim and kill.</p>
    <p>We also can­not as­sume that all cy­clists are con­sid­er­ate and re­spon­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Per­son­ally, I have en­coun­tered cy­clists zoom­ing past at high speeds – and bells be­ing sud­denly sounded from be­hind, caus­ing shock and mo­men­tary dis­ori­en­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>I still see cy­clists rid­ing on pave­ments fronting shops, and not dis­mount­ing on foot­paths which re­quire them to dis­mount and push their bi­cy­cles.</p>
    <p>The Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity’s pedes­trian code of con­duct re­quires pedes­tri­ans to ex­er­cise a duty of care, for them­selves and other users of shared paths (Pedes­trian code can help smooth path to shared re­spon­si­bil­ity, Aug 11).</p>
    <p>But un­til the code is un­am­bigu­ous, con­fu­sion and dis­putes will arise as to who has right of way.</p>
    <p>A pedes­trian code of con­duct can be mis­in­ter­preted by cy­clists to mean that the onus of re­spon­si­bil­ity for safety rests with pedes­tri­ans.</p>
    <p>Foot­paths were ini­tially meant for pedes­tri­ans, and were where they could walk with peace of mind.</p>
    <p>The ab­sence of in­fra­struc­ture has forced the con­cept of shared paths. Pedes­tri­ans can no longer walk with peace of mind, not know­ing when a cy­clist will sud­denly ap­pear from be­hind. The el­derly and young chil­dren are espe­cially vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>So while a pedes­trian code is ben­e­fi­cial in in­still­ing safe and re­spon­si­ble be­hav­iour by pedes­tri­ans, an un­am­bigu­ous and tough code of con­duct is needed for cy­clists.</p>
    <p>Un­til the code is un­am­bigu­ous, con­fu­sion and dis­putes will arise as to who has right of way. A pedes­trian code of con­duct can be mis­in­ter­preted by cy­clists to mean that the onus of re­spon­si­bil­ity for safety rests with pedes­tri­ans.</p>
