    <p>The im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic on economies and com­pa­nies is well doc­u­mented.</p>
    <p>Be­sides caus­ing mas­sive job losses around the world, it has hit the bot­tom line and bal­ance sheet of com­pa­nies, caus­ing mount­ing cor­po­rate debt and other li­a­bil­i­ties. In­sol­vency cases and cor­po­rate dis­tress have risen to their high­est lev­els since the 1997 Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>By some ac­counts, there is about $10 bil­lion on the in­sol­vency books in Sin­ga­pore alone. Across Asia, the num­bers are mind-bog­gling.</p>
    <p>But ev­ery cri­sis brings op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral weeks ago, The Straits Times high­lighted how Sin­ga­pore has been steadily gain­ing a rep­u­ta­tion as a re­gional hub for re­struc­tur­ing and res­o­lu­tion of cor­po­rate in­sol­vency.</p>
    <p>A key de­vel­op­ment which opens up op­por­tu­ni­ties on this front is Sin­ga­pore’s newly en­acted In­sol­vency, Re­struc­tur­ing and Dis­so­lu­tion Act (IRDA), namely the mora­to­rium un­der Sec­tion 64 (pre­vi­ously Sec­tion 211B of the</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies Act).</p>
    <p>In a nut­shell, the Sec­tion 64 mora­to­rium, en­acted in July, en­ables dis­tressed com­pa­nies to be pro­tected from cred­i­tors, then re­fi­nanced and re­floated.</p>
    <p>This is im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>The tra­di­tional way of deal­ing with dis­tressed and in­sol­vent com­pa­nies, go­ing back decades, has been sim­ple and straight­for­ward: liq­ui­da­tion and re­ceiver­ship. In short, shut it down, lock it up, sell the as­sets, pay cred­i­tors and move on.</p>
    <p>In 1987, this ju­di­cial man­age­ment (JM) regime was en­acted on the back of the col­lapse of Pan-Elec­tric In­dus­tries (Pan-El) in 1985. It was the largest Sin­ga­pore cor­po­rate fail­ure at the time, and caused the un­prece­dented clo­sure of the Sin­ga­pore and Malaysian stock ex­changes for three days.</p>
    <p>The large-scale dis­rup­tion from Pan-El re­sulted from the lack of a suf­fi­cient le­gal frame­work for cor­po­rate res­cues.</p>
    <p>De­spite the in­jec­tion of about $20 mil­lion by Malaysian ty­coon</p>
    <p>Khoo Kay Peng, Pan-El had to first be placed in re­ceiver­ship in 1985, be­fore be­ing put in liq­ui­da­tion in 1986.</p>
    <p>To­day, some 34 years later, el­e­ments of Pan-El re­main in liq­ui­da­tion! At that time, there was no other op­tion for cor­po­rate res­cue.</p>
    <p>A regime, which called for ju­di­cial man­agers to es­sen­tially “lock up and sell” the com­pany and its as­sets, re­sulted in the com­pany’s man­age­ment, with its know-how, con­nec­tions and tech­ni­cal ex­per­tise, be­ing abruptly dis­placed by ac­coun­tants not equipped to ei­ther man­age the op­er­a­tions or deal with ex­ter­nal par­ties, sup­pli­ers or cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Ju­di­cial man­agers faced ad­di­tional chal­lenges deal­ing with larger com­pa­nies with for­eign busi­ness ju­ris­dic­tions, es­pe­cially when it came to as­set re­cov­ery or preser­va­tion.</p>
    <p>Thus, this JM route can be in­her­ently value-de­struc­tive.</p>
    <p>But a lot has changed since then. By in­cor­po­rat­ing the best parts of Chap­ter 11 of the United States Bank­ruptcy Code, the Bri­tish scheme of ar­range­ment, and el­e­ments from a pre­vi­ous pro­vi­sion un­der Sin­ga­pore’s</p>
    <p>Sec­tion 210 of the Com­pa­nies Act, re­struc­tur­ing un­der Sec­tion 64 of IRDA strength­ens the mora­to­rium pro­tect­ing the debtor com­pany and makes it eas­ier for it to se­cure much-needed fresh fund­ing.</p>
    <p>This “debtor-in-pos­ses­sion” re­struc­tur­ing has been far more ef­fec­tive in giv­ing dis­tressed com­pa­nies a chance to re­ha­bil­i­tate or to sur­vive as a go­ing con­cern. It does so by hav­ing the ac­coun­tants and lawyers deal with the fi­nan­cial re­struc­tur­ing, while al­low­ing the man­age­ment to con­tinue to run the busi­ness, in­su­lated from cred­i­tors through a mora­to­rium.</p>
    <p>Here are some num­bers to il­lus­trate the point.</p>
    <p>As at end-Septem­ber, at least 36 com­pa­nies were granted JM. Of th­ese, 32 are still go­ing through the JM mill, while the re­main­ing four are in liq­ui­da­tion. Those still em­broiled in the JM process in­clude dis­tressed oil trader Hin Leong, Ocean Tankers and Xihe Hold­ings, with to­tal debts of more than $8 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, an­other 15 com­pa­nies ap­plied to go via the mora­to­rium route. Of th­ese, 13 are still un­der­go­ing re­struc­tur­ing, while the other two are in JM or liq­ui­da­tion.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, ac­cord­ing to the Gov­ern­ment Gazette of Oct 5, ap­prox­i­mately 73.2 per cent of com­pa­nies that ap­plied for a mora­to­rium un­der the pre­vi­ous Sec­tion 211B since 2017 are cur­rently alive or still un­der­go­ing re­struc­tur­ing. Only 26.8 per cent have gone into liq­ui­da­tion, JM, re­ceiver­ship, or have been struck off or ceased regis­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Ap­prox­i­mately 73.6 per cent of com­pa­nies which were granted a JM or­der since the mid-1990s were liq­ui­dated, struck off or dis­solved; 11.4 per cent are in JM; 1.5 per cent were listed shell com­pa­nies that were sold; and only 13.5 per cent had their JM or­der dis­charged and com­pany re­struc­tured.</p>
    <p>It does not take a ge­nius to fig­ure out that the pro­tec­tion of­fered by mora­to­rium un­der Sec­tion 64 of IRDA is a far more de­sir­able fate for in­sol­vent com­pa­nies than be­ing placed un­der JM.</p>
    <p>This is the rea­son a grow­ing num­ber of off­shore play­ers are look­ing at Sin­ga­pore, with its strong le­gal frame­work, top-notch fi­nan­cial ex­per­tise and rep­u­ta­tion for ef­fi­ciency and in­tegrity, as a place for ef­fec­tive and ef­fi­cient cor­po­rate in­sol­vency re­struc­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>That said, Sin­ga­pore does not yet have a res­cue-fi­nanc­ing in­dus­try, like that in the US. Over time, this will have to be de­vel­oped.</p>
    <p>JM need not be the so­lu­tion, even in cases of sus­pected fraud or where there is mis­trust be­tween the cred­i­tors and the man­age­ment of the dis­tressed com­pany.</p>
    <p>Malfea­sance can be eas­ily ad­dressed by re­quir­ing the im­me­di­ate res­ig­na­tion and re­place­ment of the di­rec­tor in ques­tion. Cash con­trols and mon­i­tor­ing can be put in place if cred­i­tors re­quire greater se­cu­rity, pro­tec­tion or ac­count­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>The bot­tom line is that the dis­tressed com­pany will have the best chance of sur­vival in the hands of the man­age­ment with the nec­es­sary ex­per­tise and ex­pe­ri­ence to run the busi­ness, than against a pro­fes­sional ac­coun­tant who has no track record in the rel­e­vant in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>This debtor-in-re­struc­tur­ing ap­proach has al­ready re­sulted in some no­table cor­po­rate res­cues.</p>
    <p>One par­tic­u­lar case is Asia Pulp & Pa­per (APP) in 2004, which was the largest cor­po­rate-debt de­fault re­struc­tur­ing at the time. Had APP not suc­cess­fully re­sisted an ap­pli­ca­tion to be placed un­der JM, it would likely have gone into liq­ui­da­tion. It would not have suc­cess­fully re­struc­tured to be­come the world’s se­cond-largest pa­per and pulp pro­ducer that it is to­day.</p>
    <p>The im­pact of the pan­demic has changed at­ti­tudes to­wards busi­ness fail­ures.</p>
    <p>The busi­ness world is in­creas­ingly lean­ing to­wards greater will­ing­ness for cred­i­tors to co­op­er­ate with the in­cum­bent man­age­ment of dis­tressed com­pa­nies. Such re­struc­tur­ings can also de­liver more value for cred­i­tors and share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>If Sin­ga­pore gains a rep­u­ta­tion as an Asian hub for this type of re­struc­tur­ing, it can also spur an en­tire ecosys­tem of value-adding cor­po­rate ser­vices that go be­yond the le­gal, fi­nanc­ing and au­dit­ing fields. The de­mand for sec­re­tar­iat ser­vices, lo­gis­tics, hos­pi­tal­ity, travel, prop­erty and others can grow.</p>
    <p>In­deed, ev­ery cri­sis can open the door to new op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
