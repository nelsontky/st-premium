    <p>My first sum­mer job was at the port of Beirut. It was the late 1990s and I was just a teenager. I spent muggy months en­ter­ing ship­ping data as part of an am­bi­tious new pro­gramme to move the port from ana­logue to dig­i­tal log keep­ing. It was as unglam­orous as you would ex­pect from a bot­tom-rung job in the bow­els of a Mid­dle East bu­reau­cracy. But de­spite the heat and the monotony, there was op­ti­mism.</p>
    <p>The port was crit­i­cal in­fra­struc­ture in an econ­omy re­ju­ve­nat­ing af­ter 15 years of civil war. Dig­i­tal log keep­ing was part of the fu­ture – and an at­tempt to in­tro­duce much-needed or­der and trans­parency to a re­cov­er­ing pub­lic sec­tor. This was, af­ter all, the same port that had been ren­dered un­us­able dur­ing the civil war by sunken ves­sels and un­ex­ploded ord­nance, save for one area con­trolled by a mili­tia.</p>
    <p>The Le­banon that emerged from that rub­ble is gone, grad­u­ally choked by a cyn­i­cal po­lit­i­cal class. On Tues­day, it was fin­ished off. The port of Beirut was blown up in an ex­plo­sion that killed at least 100 peo­ple (and count­ing), wounded more than 4,000 and de­stroyed blocks of the city. Le­banon now faces a new type of catas­tro­phe for which decades of war and po­lit­i­cal in­sta­bil­ity were poor prepa­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>By all ap­pear­ances the port dis­as­ter did not in­volve the usual sus­pects – Hizbol­lah, Is­rael, mil­i­tants or the gov­ern­ment of neigh­bour­ing Syria. The truth seems to be both duller and more dis­turb­ing: Decades of rot at every level of Le­banon’s in­sti­tu­tions de­stroyed Beirut’s port, much of the city and far too many lives. It is pre­cisely the ba­nal­ity be­hind the ex­plo­sion that cap­tures the par­tic­u­lar pu­n­ish­ment and hu­mil­i­a­tion heaped on Le­banon.</p>
    <p>So far, Le­banese of­fi­cials are in agree­ment about what hap­pened, though it’s likely that more than one “of­fi­cial” ac­count will emerge. Af­ter all, this is Le­banon, a coun­try deeply di­vided by pol­i­tics, re­li­gion and his­tory. But here is what we know as of now, ac­cord­ing to re­port­ing by credible Le­banese me­dia: Some 2,750 tonnes of am­mo­nium ni­trate un­loaded from a dis­abled ves­sel in 2014 had been stored in a port ware­house. Then on Tues­day, a weld­ing ac­ci­dent ig­nited nearby fire­works – which caused the am­mo­nium ni­trate to ex­plode.</p>
    <p>Ports are prime real es­tate for po­lit­i­cal, crim­i­nal and mili­tia fac­tions. Mul­ti­ple se­cu­rity agen­cies with dif­fer­ent lev­els of com­pe­tence (and dif­fer­ent po­lit­i­cal al­le­giances) con­trol var­i­ous as­pects of their op­er­a­tions. And re­cruit­ment in the civil­ian bu­reau­cracy is dic­tated by po­lit­i­cal or sec­tar­ian quo­tas. There is a per­va­sive cul­ture of neg­li­gence, petty cor­rup­tion and blame-shift­ing en­demic to the Le­banese bu­reau­cracy, all over­seen by a po­lit­i­cal class de­fined by its in­com­pe­tence and con­tempt for the pub­lic good.</p>
    <p>It’s un­clear what com­bi­na­tion of these el­e­ments let a bomb-in-wait­ing sit in a ware­house for al­most six years, moved fire­works next to it and al­lowed ir­re­spon­si­ble work prac­tices to be car­ried out nearby. But the catas­tro­phe, while ex­cep­tion­ally se­vere, is the re­sult of busi­ness as usual in Le­banon.</p>
    <p>The coun­try is fa­mil­iar with ex­plo­sions, and it is just as fa­mil­iar with dis­as­ters caused by fail­ures of pub­lic ser­vices: a garbage cri­sis that dates back to 2015, an en­vi­ron­men­tal catas­tro­phe last year and power out­ages this year that last up to 20 hours a day.</p>
    <p>The con­se­quences of Tues­day’s ex­plo­sion will be even more se­ri­ous than the im­me­di­ate ca­su­al­ties and prop­erty dam­age. The main grain silo, which holds some 85 per cent of the coun­try’s ce­re­als, was de­stroyed. Even more, the port will no longer be able to re­ceive goods. Le­banon im­ports 80 per cent of what it con­sumes, in­clud­ing 90 per cent of its wheat, which is used to make the bread that is the sta­ple of most peo­ple’s di­ets.</p>
    <p>About 60 per cent of those im­ports come through the port of Beirut.</p>
    <p>Or, at least, they did.</p>
    <p>The tim­ing couldn’t be worse. An eco­nomic cri­sis has dev­as­tated Le­banon for sev­eral months. The coun­try’s cur­rency has col­lapsed, a prob­lem that is it­self a re­sult of years of mis­man­age­ment and cor­rup­tion. Hun­dreds of thou­sands of peo­ple can no longer buy fuel, food and medicine. As Le­banese have seen their savings wiped out and their pur­chas­ing power dis­ap­pear, a new vo­cab­u­lary ap­peared among even my op­ti­mistic Le­banese friends and fam­ily. To de­scribe the coun­try, they be­gan us­ing words like “doomed” and “hope­less”.</p>
    <p>And the coro­n­avirus cri­sis has placed greater pres­sure on the health sec­tor. Af­ter Tues­day’s ex­plo­sion, hos­pi­tal staff were re­port­edly treat­ing in­juries in streets and park­ing spa­ces.</p>
    <p>The ex­plo­sion may well put Le­banon on the path to a food and health catas­tro­phe not seen in the worst of its wars.</p>
    <p>Le­banon’s po­lit­i­cal class should be on guard in the weeks ahead: Shock will in­evitably turn to anger. But I fear that old habits die hard. These politi­cians are well prac­tised in shift­ing the blame. I don’t ex­pect many – if any – high-level res­ig­na­tions or ad­mis­sions of re­spon­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Will there be a revo­lu­tion? An up­ris­ing of anger? Any rev­o­lu­tion­ary im­pulse has to com­pete with tribal, sec­tar­ian and ide­o­log­i­cal af­fil­i­a­tions. For that mat­ter, so do the facts: Even if a sin­gle of­fi­cial ver­sion of the port in­ci­dent is pre­sented (and even if it is true), some will not be­lieve it. Para­dox­i­cally, our distrust of our politi­cians makes it harder to unite against them.</p>
    <p>These are real ob­sta­cles. Yet there has never been more ur­gency for re­form and ac­count­abil­ity, be­yond the likely scape­goat­ing of mid-level of­fi­cials. It is dif­fi­cult to imag­ine such a con­certed, sus­tained na­tional move­ment be­cause it has never ma­te­ri­alised. But hunger and a col­lapse in health­care may change that.</p>
    <p>Le­banon – and the Le­banese – will need a rapid in­flux of ex­ter­nal aid to stave off a crit­i­cal food short­age and pub­lic health catas­tro­phe. It seems to be com­ing, from coun­tries across the Mid­dle East and the rest of the world. But this will not ar­rest the coun­try’s de­cline. Emer­gency aid will only mag­nify pub­lic hu­mil­i­a­tion and help­less­ness. Tues­day’s ex­plo­sion made clear that</p>
    <p>Le­banon is no longer a coun­try where de­cent peo­ple can live se­cure and ful­fill­ing lives.</p>
    <p>As I watched videos of Beirut en­gulfed in smoke and checked in with my friends and fam­ily, I found my­self think­ing for the first time in a while of that sum­mer when I worked at the port. The digi­ti­sa­tion project was com­pleted, but par­ties which dis­liked the trans­parency it brought found ways to work around it.</p>
    <p>To­day, it’s ir­rel­e­vant, of course. The port is de­stroyed. As for the Le­banese, they will be far more con­sumed by sur­vival than progress.</p>
