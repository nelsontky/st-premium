    <p>A vac­cine will not be a sil­ver bul­let to end the Covid-19 pan­demic and the world still needs to im­prove its re­sponse to fight the virus.</p>
    <p>Dr Takeshi Ka­sai, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s (WHO) re­gional di­rec­tor for the Western Pa­cific, said at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day that he is cau­tiously op­ti­mistic about a Covid-19 vac­cine – op­ti­mistic be­cause he is very im­pressed by the speed of vac­cine devel­op­ment, and cau­tious be­cause even if a safe and ef­fec­tive vac­cine is found, pro­duc­tion ca­pac­ity is un­likely to meet global demand.</p>
    <p>One coun­try that has been ac­tively in­volved in vac­cine re­search and devel­op­ment is China, which has seven vac­cine can­di­dates ad­vanc­ing into phase two and phase three of clin­i­cal tri­als.</p>
    <p>Yet, de­spite the ac­cel­er­ated speed of re­search and devel­op­ment, a panel of three WHO ex­perts stressed the need to en­sure the safety and ef­fi­cacy of all vac­cine can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>The in­ter­na­tional body has been “work­ing with a num­ber of re­search and devel­op­ment in­sti­tutes across the world, and guid­ing the conduct and pro­vid­ing pro­to­col for vac­cine clin­i­cal tri­als”.</p>
    <p>In other coun­tries, such as Ja­pan, re­search, devel­op­ment and man­u­fac­tur­ing of vac­cines are also un­der way. One can­di­date is now in stage two of clin­i­cal tri­als and four other can­di­dates are in the stages of pre-clin­i­cal stud­ies, WHO said.</p>
    <p>In terms of man­u­fac­tur­ing, at least two com­pa­nies in Ja­pan are al­ready dis­cussing the trans­fer of tech­nol­ogy to man­u­fac­ture the vac­cines once they are ap­proved, which would help al­low for quicker scal­ing up of vac­cine pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>A safe and ef­fec­tive pan­demic vac­cine is a global pub­lic good that coun­tries world­wide should have ac­cess to, the panel said at a ques­tion-and-an­swer seg­ment dur­ing the press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­i­sa­tion called for rapid, fair and eq­ui­table ac­cess to any such vac­cines glob­ally.</p>
    <p>“We hope that the work that is on­go­ing in Ja­pan and other coun­tries in the re­gion on re­search and devel­op­ment, and man­u­fac­tur­ing of vac­cines will ben­e­fit equally the other coun­tries in the Western Pa­cific,” the panel said.</p>
    <p>But en­sur­ing fair and eq­ui­table vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion glob­ally will not be easy, the WHO said.</p>
    <p>It noted, how­ever, that the vac­cine will not be­long to a sin­gle coun­try, but in­stead to all coun­tries, as no coun­try is safe un­less all coun­tries are pro­tected.</p>
    <p>Ini­tia­tives will also be es­tab­lished to ex­pe­dite the devel­op­ment and ac­cess for a safe and ef­fec­tive vac­cine, and the WHO is work­ing with coun­tries around the world on this.</p>
    <p>When asked for the WHO’s opin­ion on the safety and ef­fec­tive­ness of Russia’s vac­cine, which is ready to go into pro­duc­tion, with the Philip­pines say­ing it is ready to re­ceive it, the panel said the or­gan­i­sa­tion is in the process of co­or­di­nat­ing and con­tact­ing the sci­en­tists and ex­perts, as well as the Rus­sian reg­u­la­tory au­thor­i­ties, to get ev­i­dence for this new vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The first batch of Sput­nik V – named in homage to the world’s first satel­lite, launched by the Soviet Union in 1957 – was de­vel­oped by the Ga­ma­leya Re­search In­sti­tute of Epi­demi­ol­ogy and Mi­cro­bi­ol­ogy in Moscow in co­or­di­na­tion with the Rus­sian De­fence Min­istry.</p>
    <p>Russia has said in­dus­trial pro­duc­tion is ex­pected from next month and it plans to man­u­fac­ture five mil­lion doses per month by De­cem­ber or next Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>But a sur­vey of 3,040 doc­tors and health spe­cial­ists in Russia found the ma­jor­ity would not feel com­fort­able be­ing in­jected with the new Covid-19 vac­cine due to the lack of suf­fi­cient data about it and its su­per-fast ap­proval.</p>
