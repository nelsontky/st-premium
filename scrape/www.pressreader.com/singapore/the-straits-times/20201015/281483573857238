    <p>The re­volv­ing door of “one and done” tele­vi­sion shows – the kind that pop up on screen for a sin­gle sea­son and are never seen again – does not stop spin­ning.</p>
    <p>This is es­pe­cially in the era of so-called “peak TV”, with more than 530 scripted tele­vi­sion shows in the United States alone last year com­pared with just 350 or so in 2013.</p>
    <p>The glut comes from the pro­lif­er­a­tion of new ser­vices such as Net­flix and Dis­ney+, which bran­dish shiny new ti­tles to lure view­ers away from tra­di­tional chan­nels.</p>
    <p>But a hand­ful of scripted se­ries on the lat­ter are still go­ing strong – no­tably the med­i­cal drama Grey’s Anatomy, which de­buted in 2005, crime pro­ce­dural NCIS (2003) and zom­bie dystopia The Walk­ing Dead (2010).</p>
    <p>An­i­mated come­dies The Simp­sons (1989) and Fam­ily Guy (1999) have had even more stay­ing power, as have com­pe­ti­tion-based re­al­ity shows The Amaz­ing Race (2001), The Bach­e­lor (2002) and Amer­ica’s Next Top Model (2003).</p>
    <p>How have they man­aged to hang on?</p>
    <p>The trick seems to be stick­ing to the for­mu­las that made them pop­u­lar in the first place, but in­tro­duc­ing just enough novelty to keep things fresh – reg­u­lar in­fu­sions of fresh blood in the cast, for in­stance, or tack­ling zeit­geisty sub­jects such as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>And while win­ning awards is a boost for newer shows, the in­evitable dip in crit­i­cal ac­claim for most lon­grun­ning se­ries af­ter their early sea­sons does not de­ter loyal fans.</p>
    <p>This is es­pe­cially true for the re­peat­edly snubbed NCIS, which has never been nom­i­nated for a ma­jor Emmy in its marathon run – not even for se­ries stal­wart Mark Har­mon, who plays the head of a team of spe­cial agents from the navy’s law en­force­ment branch.</p>
    <p>Yet these shows con­tinue to chug along nicely.</p>
    <p>Last year, Grey’s Anatomy of­fi­cially re­placed ER (1994 to 2009) as TV’s long­est-run­ning prime-time med­i­cal drama as it cruised into its 15th sea­son and 342nd episode. ER aired 331 episodes over 15 sea­sons.</p>
    <p>And Grey’s Anatomy – which has pro­duced two spin-offs, Pri­vate Prac­tice (2007 to 2013) and Sta­tion 19 (2018 to present) – con­sis­tently tops prime-time rat­ings in the United States and the more than 235 other coun­tries where it is seen.</p>
    <p>Ellen Pom­peo plays the epony­mous Mered­ith Grey, whom view­ers first met as an am­bi­tious young sur­geon in 2005, and whose ca­reer and ro­man­tic ad­ven­tures have an­chored the show ever since.</p>
    <p>The Grey’s Anatomy global</p>
    <p>em­pire is “a US$4 bil­lion (S$5.44 bil­lion) busi­ness, and it’s ev­ery­where in the world”, she tells The Hol­ly­wood Re­porter magazine.</p>
    <p>And its cul­tural im­pact has been just as sweep­ing, ac­cord­ing to the 50-year-old who, with her US$20mil­lion-a-sea­son salary, is TV’s high­est-paid l ead ac­tress on a prime-time drama.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­where I go, I get, ‘ My daugh­ter is a sur­geon be­cause of you,’” she says.</p>
    <p>Pom­peo has stayed as, one by one, most of the other orig­i­nal cast – in­clud­ing San­dra Oh (Killing Eve, 2018 to present) – have ex­ited.</p>
    <p>But the show has brought in new faces to re­place them, in­clud­ing Dr Grey’s lat­est love in­ter­est, Dr DeLuca, played by Gi­a­como Giannotti (see story be­low).</p>
    <p>And the cur­rent sea­son fea­tures a timely Covid-19 sto­ry­line, showrun­ner Krista Ver­noff, 46, says in a panel dis­cus­sion on­line.</p>
    <p>“There’s no way to be a long-run­ning med­i­cal show and not do the med­i­cal story of our life­times.”</p>
    <p>The Walk­ing Dead is an­other case study in longevity – this de­spite a fan base that has not been shy about cri­tiquing sto­ry­lines it does not ap­prove of.</p>
    <p>But while view­er­ship has trended down over the years, there is plenty of life in it yet, the show rou­tinely out­per­form­ing most oth­ers in its time slot in the US, where its re­cently con­cluded 10th sea­son was the most-viewed ca­ble drama for the 2019 to 2020 TV sea­son.</p>
    <p>Its net­work, AMC, an­nounced last month that the se­ries will con­clude its run in 2022.</p>
    <p>But its two big­gest stars, Nor­man Ree­dus and Melissa McBride, who play fan favourites Daryl and Carol, will get their own spin-off.</p>
    <p>This ex­pands the uni­verse be­yond the first spin-off, Fear The Walk­ing Dead (2015 to present), along with a slate of up­com­ing films star­ring the show’s orig­i­nal pro­tag­o­nist, Sher­iff Rick Grimes (An­drew Lin­coln), who in the pilot woke up to find the world over­run by a zom­bie virus.</p>
    <p>As with any long-run­ning drama, The Walk­ing Dead must keep things both in­ter­est­ing and con­sis­tent for its ea­gle-eyed fans, who have been tun­ing in now for 10 years.</p>
    <p>But sus­tain­ing a zom­bie apoc­a­lypse for a decade also presents a unique con­ti­nu­ity chal­lenge, says ex­ec­u­tive pro­ducer Greg Ni­cotero, who over­sees the Emmy-win­ning make-up and pros­thet­ics.</p>
    <p>The 57-year-old says his make-up depart­ment is “con­stantly try­ing to gauge the level of rot and de­cay” on the zom­bies’ bod­ies given how much time has passed, and strive to make it sub­tly but pro­gres­sively worse.</p>
    <p>“Ten years into the zom­bie apoc­a­lypse, we want it to look like if you grabbed a zom­bie, your hand could sink through its chest and slide right into its liquified or­gans,” he tells Wired magazine.</p>
    <p>“It is chal­leng­ing to gauge where we are with each show.”</p>
