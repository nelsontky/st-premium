    <p>THE HAGUE A Rus­sian sus­pect in the crash of Flight MH17 saw no sign of the mis­sile al­legedly used to shoot down the plane, he said in a video played at his trial on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Oleg Pu­la­tov is one of four men be­ing tried in ab­sen­tia by a Dutch court over the loss of the Malaysia</p>
    <p>Air­lines jet, which was trav­el­ling from Am­s­ter­dam to Kuala Lumpur when it was downed over east­ern Ukraine on July 17, 2014.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tors say a Soviet-era BUK mis­sile fired by pro-Rus­sian rebels was used to hit the air­liner, which crashed with the loss of all 298 peo­ple on board, in­clud­ing 196</p>
    <p>Dutch na­tion­als. The mis­sile was fired from ter­ri­tory held by proRus­sian rebels dur­ing fight­ing in east­ern Ukraine, said in­ter­na­tional</p>
    <p>in­ves­ti­ga­tors.</p>
    <p>“No, I haven’t seen a BUK mis­sile and I can also say for sure there was cer­tainly no BUK seen,” Pula</p>
    <p>tov, the only sus­pect to be rep­re­sented by de­fence lawyers, said in a video mes­sage.</p>
    <p>“No BUK or any com­mands re­lated to a BUK were men­tioned” dur­ing meet­ings he had with other rebels on the day of the crash, he added.</p>
    <p>The first he heard about the crash was when his sol­diers “told me about the lat­est news, that a plane got crashed near Donetsk”, he said in the mes­sage played to the court near Schiphol air­port, where the doomed plane took off from.</p>
    <p>“My peo­ple from there told me that they were in­ter­cept­ing a lot of calls where they heard that there were lit­er­ally bod­ies and corpses of peo­ple fall­ing from the sky,” he added.</p>
    <p>The four sus­pects – Rus­sian na­tion­als Pu­la­tov, Igor Girkin and Sergei Du­bin­sky, as well as Ukrainian cit­i­zen Leonid Kharchenko – are all ac­cused of be­ing key fig­ures among the sep­a­ratist rebels bat­tling Kiev.</p>
    <p>Pu­la­tov was a for­mer Rus­sian spe­cial forces soldier and one of Du­bin­sky’s deputies who al­legedly helped trans­port the mis­sile sys­tem to Ukraine from its base in Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tors say they are still try­ing to track the crew of the BUK, which was from the Rus­sian army’s 53rd Anti-Air­craft Mis­sile Bri­gade based in the city of Kursk.</p>
    <p>The trial, which be­gan in March, is still hear­ing de­fence sub­mis­sions con­cern­ing ev­i­dence.</p>
