    <p>SEOUL • South Korea yes­ter­day said it has signed deals to pro­vide coro­n­avirus vac­cines for 44 mil­lion peo­ple next year but that it would not hurry the in­oc­u­la­tion drive, al­low­ing more time to ob­serve po­ten­tial side ef­fects.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has ar­ranged to buy 20 mil­lion doses each from As­traZeneca, Pfizer and Moderna, and an­other four mil­lion doses from John­son & John­son’s Janssen, enough to cover up to 34 mil­lion peo­ple, Health Min­is­ter Park Ne­ung-hoo told a brief­ing.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tional doses for 10 mil­lion peo­ple would be pro­cured through the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s Co­vax global vac­cine project.</p>
    <p>De­spite a cur­rent surge in Covid-19 cases, South Korea’s rel­a­tive suc­cess in tamp­ing down pre­vi­ous waves meant it did not need to rush any vac­ci­na­tion drive, Mr Park said. “We don’t see the need to hur­riedly be­gin vac­ci­na­tion with­out en­sur­ing that the vac­cines’ risks have been ver­i­fied.”</p>
    <p>Ship­ments of the vac­cines would be­gin no later than March, but wide­spread vac­ci­na­tion was likely to start only in the sec­ond half of next year, after the au­thor­i­ties ob­served how the vac­cines worked in other coun­tries to en­sure safety.</p>
    <p>The first vac­cines would likely be given to med­i­cal workers, the el­derly and med­i­cally vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple, as well as so­cial workers.</p>
    <p>South Korea has more than tripled the num­ber of Covid-19 vac­cine con­tain­ers that air­craft can carry by eas­ing lim­its on dry ice needed to keep them cold, said Deputy Min­is­ter for Civil Avi­a­tion Kim Sang-do yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The coun­try is work­ing on ways to es­tab­lish cold chain de­liv­ery sys­tems for vac­cines like Pfizer’s, which re­quire stor­age at be­low mi­nus 70 deg C.</p>
    <p>One dif­fi­culty is that air­planes can carry only a limited amount of dry ice, as it turns into gas over time, dis­plac­ing the breath­able air in the plane’s cabin.</p>
    <p>The Trans­port Min­istry has raised the limit of dry ice a plane can carry from 3,300kg to up to 11,000kg, which will al­low a Boe­ing 747 cargo plane to carry 52 con­tain­ers of vac­cines, up from 15.</p>
    <p>To al­low this, it will boost safety mea­sures, such as the in­stal­la­tion of gas me­ters, the min­istry said.</p>
