    <p>Nearly half of the em­ploy­ees of the Sun­tec Sin­ga­pore Con­ven­tion and Ex­hi­bi­tion Cen­tre (Sun­tec Sin­ga­pore) have been re­trenched amid the on­go­ing dec­i­ma­tion of the meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­ven­tions and ex­hi­bi­tions (Mice) in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The venue said yes­ter­day that the 85 work­ers – con­sist­ing of 60 Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents, and 25 for­eign­ers – held jobs in food pro­duc­tion, sales and events, hu­man re­sources, and fi­nance.</p>
    <p>With the re­trench­ment ex­er­cise, Sun­tec Sin­ga­pore will have a re­main­ing work­force of 89 lo­cal staff and four for­eign staff.</p>
    <p>“Due care has also been taken to en­sure an age­less work­force, main­tain­ing staff across the var­i­ous age groups,” said Sun­tec Sin­ga­pore in a joint state­ment with the Build­ing Con­struc­tion and Tim­ber In­dus­tries Em­ploy­ees’ Union (Batu).</p>
    <p>Sun­tec Sin­ga­pore said the Mice in­dus­try has been se­verely im­pacted by the on­go­ing Covid-19 pan­demic and events have been sus­pended since April.</p>
    <p>It has been work­ing with Batu since Fe­bru­ary on cost-cut­ting mea­sures, which in­clude hir­ing freezes, re­de­ploy­ment of staff, clear­ing of an­nual leave, shorter work weeks and tem­po­rary salary re­duc­tions in the form of un­paid leave.</p>
    <p>The man­age­ment of Sun­tec Sin­ga­pore has also taken pay cuts, it said, but un­cer­tainty re­mains over when the sit­u­a­tion will im­prove.</p>
    <p>It said it con­sulted Batu on the re­trench­ment ex­er­cise, which was in com­pli­ance with the Na­tional Trades Union Congress’ (NTUC) Fair Re­trench­ment Frame­work, tri­par­tite ad­vi­sories and the col­lec­tive agree­ment with the union.</p>
    <p>Sun­tec Sin­ga­pore chief ex­ec­u­tive Arun Mad­hok said the de­ci­sion was not taken lightly and did not re­flect on any­one’s per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>“Every in­di­vid­ual in our team has con­trib­uted to the suc­cess of our com­pany for many years and I am truly sorry to have to ask many of our won­der­ful and tal­ented peo­ple to look for al­ter­na­tive em­ploy­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sun­tec Sin­ga­pore said staff will be al­lowed to use the no­tice pe­riod to make plans for their fu­ture. It will also give a one-off train­ing grant of $25,000 to Batu to sup­port union mem­bers to at­tend skills train­ing for new jobs.</p>
    <p>So far, NTUC’s Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute has iden­ti­fied at least two job op­por­tu­ni­ties for each lo­cal em­ployee who is af­fected, said Sun­tec Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>One em­ployee who wanted to be known only as Mr Su­laiman, 39, said he ap­pre­ci­ated the as­sis­tance from NTUC and other agen­cies.</p>
    <p>The for­mer au­dio­vi­sual tech­ni­cian said he was pre­sented with job matches such as in­stalling in­fo­tain­ment sys­tems in ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>For now, Mr Su­laiman, whose wife is ex­pect­ing their first child, plans to com­plete a train­ing course for se­cu­rity of­fi­cers be­fore tak­ing up a vo­ca­tional li­cence to be a taxi driver. “To me, it’s not the end of the world. I’d rather be op­ti­mistic,” he said.</p>
