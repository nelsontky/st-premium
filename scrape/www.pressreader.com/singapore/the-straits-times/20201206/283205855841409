    <p>This year has been tough for all of us. I never ex­pected this tour­na­ment to hap­pen in the first place.</p>
    <p>SA­MUEL KANG, men’s na­tional cham­pion.</p>
    <p>On pa­per, it was like noth­ing had changed at the Marigold Na­tional Squash Championsh­ips.</p>
    <p>Two-time de­fend­ing cham­pi­ons Sa­muel Kang and Au Yeong Wai Yhann re­tained their men’s and women’s open ti­tles re­spec­tively yes­ter­day. But, in re­al­ity, it was a very dif­fer­ent event for the play­ers to come back to af­ter a year of not com­pet­ing owing to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Play­ers could en­ter the venue, Kal­lang Squash Cen­tre, only 15 min­utes be­fore the match and had to wait at a sep­a­rate hold­ing area be­fore be­ing ush­ered to their re­spec­tive courts. Spec­ta­tors were also not al­lowed.</p>
    <p>But Kang, 29, was just happy to be com­pet­ing again af­ter a year. His last tour­na­ment was the 2019 Men’s World Team Squash Championsh­ips in Wash­ing­ton, DC last De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>He beat Mar­cus Phua 3-0 (11-6, 11-4, 17-15) for his fourth na­tional ti­tle. His first in 2011 also came af­ter he beat Phua.</p>
    <p>Kang told The Sun­day Times: “I’m def­i­nitely very happy to get this win to­day. This year has been tough for all of us. I never ex­pected this tour­na­ment to hap­pen in the first place.</p>
    <p>“It was a tough match and we were both feel­ing it. At the end, he was play­ing very well.”</p>
    <p>Phua saved five match points but failed to con­vert his two game points.</p>
    <p>But the 31-year-old was still pleased with his per­for­mances over the past week, af­ter mak­ing the fi­nal with­out drop­ping a game.</p>
    <p>“I’m en­joy­ing every mo­ment of it so hope­fully I can keep up this level of squash for as long as I can and see where that takes me,” said the 2010 and 2012 cham­pion.</p>
    <p>“I was very pleased with the third set... but the qual­ity of his game re­ally showed and he hung in there.</p>
    <p>“Even though I hit a cou­ple of win­ners, they were not enough to sneak in a game. Credit to him, he played re­ally well to­day.”</p>
    <p>In the women’s fi­nal, pre-match jit­ters did not get to mul­ti­ple SEA Games medal­list Au Yeong as she com­fort­ably beat Gra­cia Chua 3-0 (11-7, 11-0, 13-11).</p>
    <p>The 21-year-old said: “I def­i­nitely had a lit­tle bit of match nerves be­cause I’ve been away from it for so long. But it feels good</p>
    <p>Above: Women’s cham­pion Au Yeong Wai Yhann. and hope­fully there will be more tour­na­ments com­ing up.”</p>
    <p>Her train­ing ses­sions were cut by 30 min­utes from two hours and only two are al­lowed in a court with no switch­ing al­lowed, but she has learnt to work around the changes.</p>
    <p>She said: “Usu­ally we get to play with more play­ers dur­ing train­ing but now we can only stick to one court. And we can only do two-peo­ple drills now.</p>
    <p>“It’s also a lit­tle dis­rup­tive be­cause if the coach wants to cor­rect us, they have to stay out­side and show us the cor­rec­tions.</p>
    <p>“But we’ve worked around it.”</p>
    <p>GOOD TO BE BACK</p>
    <p>I def­i­nitely had a lit­tle bit of match nerves be­cause I’ve been away from it for so long but it feels good and hope­fully there will be more tour­na­ments com­ing up.</p>
    <p>AU YEONG WAI YHANN, women’s na­tional cham­pion.</p>
