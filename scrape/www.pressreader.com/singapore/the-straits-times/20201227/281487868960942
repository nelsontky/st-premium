    <p>Visi­tor­ship at pub­lic sports venues in Sin­ga­pore, in­clud­ing swim­ming pools, gyms and sta­di­ums, reached 17.7 mil­lion last year. This will fall by al­most two-thirds to an es­ti­mated seven mil­lion this year, largely due to ca­pac­ity re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>LON­DON • Manch­ester United man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer ex­pressed his dis­ap­point­ment with his side not be­ing able to take their chances in the 2-2 Premier League draw at Le­ices­ter City yesterday.</p>
    <p>The Red Devils, who started the day third, missed out on the chance to move closer to lead­ers Liv­er­pool as Axel Tuanzebe’s own goal five min­utes from time meant they failed to claim all three points.</p>
    <p>Slow starts had been a fea­ture for Sol­sk­jaer’s men on the road this sea­son as they had won their pre­vi­ous six away league games de­spite</p>
    <p>con­ced­ing first. How­ever, this time it was United who twice failed to hold on to the lead.</p>
    <p>Har­vey Barnes’ fierce strike can­celled out Mar­cus Rashford’s opener be­fore half-time.</p>
    <p>Bruno Fernandes thought he had claimed an­other away win 11 min­utes from time, but Jamie Vardy’s preda­tory in­stincts kept the Foxes one point and one place above</p>
    <p>United (27) in the table as his shot de­flected in off Tuanzebe.</p>
    <p>“Dis­ap­pointed we didn’t win to­day be­cause we had loads of big chances and we could’ve fin­ished it off but they’re a dan­ger­ous side,” said Sol­sk­jaer, whose men are now un­beaten in 14 away league games with 11 wins and three draws.</p>
    <p>“It was a good goal from Mar­cus Rashford as well and I’m glad he scored.</p>
    <p>“He knows the first chance was a glo­ri­ous one (a close range header over the bar in the first half). Miss­ing that is just one of those things.</p>
    <p>“Both goals con­ceded should’ve been closed down quicker – the first one def­i­nitely and the sec­ond one we should man­age to stop the cross. You al­ways look at goals con­ceded, what we should’ve and could’ve done better.</p>
    <p>“One point is not the worst re­sult but we’re dis­ap­pointed to not get the three points.”</p>
    <p>Liv­er­pool’s lead over Le­ices­ter at the top is now three points and Jur­gen Klopp’s men can widen it when they host West Brom to­day.</p>
    <p>Sol­sk­jaer should have been cel­e­brat­ing in­side just 90 sec­onds when Rashford headed over Fernandes’ inch-per­fect cross with only Kasper Sch­me­ichel to beat.</p>
    <p>He was not so for­giv­ing when given a sec­ond op­por­tu­nity mid­way through the first half, sweep­ing Fernandes’ prod­ded through ball into the bot­tom cor­ner for his 13th goal of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>Barnes then hauled his side back into the game with his pow­er­ful blast from out­side the box on 31 min­utes.</p>
    <p>Edin­son Ca­vani was brought off the bench by Sol­sk­jaer in search of a win­ner in the fi­nal 15 min­utes. The Uruguayan made a big im­pact as he fed Fernandes to drill home his 14th goal of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>But United failed to hold out for a record-equalling 11th con­sec­u­tive away league win as Vardy’s move­ment out­foxed the vis­i­tors’ de­fence as he turned Ay­oze Perez’s cross to­wards goal and the ball bounced in off Tuanzebe.</p>
    <p>Bren­dan Rodgers, who has failed to win 10 of his 12 league en­coun­ters with United as a man­ager with nine losses and now a draw, said: “I thought it was a re­ally good game – two at­tack­ing teams.</p>
    <p>“Sec­ond half, we had to de­fend a bit more but we were com­pact and even when they scored, we had an en­thu­si­asm.</p>
    <p>“It shows the men­tal­ity of the team.”</p>
