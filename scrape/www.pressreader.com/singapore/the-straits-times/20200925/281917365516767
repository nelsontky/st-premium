    <p>Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping has given the world a glim­mer of hope right when it needs it.</p>
    <p>Record wild­fires in the United States, rapidly melt­ing Arc­tic ice, heat­waves and in­tense At­lantic storms have trig­gered alarm bells glob­ally about the grow­ing threat from cli­mate change. With the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion in the US de­ter­mined to block am­bi­tious cli­mate ac­tion, ques­tions have been grow­ing over whether the world has the will to stop the planet from over­heat­ing.</p>
    <p>In an ad­dress to the United Na­tions Gen­eral Assem­bly on Tues­day, Mr Xi said for the first time that China aims to be car­bon neu­tral be­fore 2060. He also re­vised an ear­lier pledge, say­ing the na­tion’s car­bon diox­ide emis­sions would peak be­fore 2030, com­pared with “around 2030” pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>“This an­nounce­ment will send pos­i­tive shock­waves through diplo­matic cir­cles and should prompt greater cli­mate am­bi­tion from other ma­jor emit­ters,” said Ms He­len Mount­ford, vice-pres­i­dent of cli­mate and eco­nom­ics at the World Re­sources In­sti­tute in Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>Other an­a­lysts agreed, be­cause what China does on cli­mate change mat­ters. It emits 28 per cent of emis­sions, or greater than those of the US and the Euro­pean Union com­bined.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi’s sur­prise an­nounce­ment comes as na­tions are ex­pected to of­fer new and up­dated plans this year un­der the UN’s Paris cli­mate agree­ment ahead of ma­jor talks sched­uled for next year.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi did not ex­plain how China would achieve the two tar­gets. An­a­lysts say China needs to spell out the de­tails and aim for emis­sions peak­ing as soon as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>But, in set­ting out a time­line for car­bon neu­tral­ity, Mr Xi has sig­nalled a dra­matic shift in the Chi­nese econ­omy, which is still heav­ily re­liant on pol­lut­ing coal, oil and gas for en­ergy.</p>
    <p>“Neu­tral­ity ba­si­cally means go­ing car­bon-free. It is a very un­prece­dented, mas­sive scale of in­vest­ment that is needed. It means a very dif­fer­ent way of ar­rang­ing whole as­pects of our life,” Mr Li Shuo, se­nior cli­mate and en­ergy pol­icy of­fi­cer for Green­peace East Asia, told The Straits Times from Bei­jing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>While China has been heav­ily in­vest­ing in re­new­able en­ergy, it is also build­ing coal-fired power plants. Coal, the most pol­lut­ing fos­sil fuel, re­mains the main source of China’s en­ergy. Ad­di­tional in­vest­ment in it will make it harder for the coun­try to quickly switch to a greener econ­omy.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts say much now de­pends on the de­tails in China’s 2021-2025 five-year plan, due out next March.</p>
    <p>“The key chal­lenge and key test is how the vi­sion can be trans­lated into the five-year plan to make tan­gi­ble progress to­wards an emis­sions peak, and take the first step to­wards a fully de­car­bonised econ­omy,” said Mr Lauri</p>
    <p>Myl­lyvirta, lead an­a­lyst for the Cen­tre for Re­search on En­ergy and Clean Air.</p>
    <p>“What we need to see now is this long-term am­bi­tion and ear­lier tar­get date for emis­sions peak trans­lated into more clean en­ergy and less coal in that five-year plan,” he said in a blog post.</p>
    <p>For Mr Li, fur­ther clar­ity could come in a se­ries of tar­gets. “Are we go­ing to set a strin­gent coal con­sump­tion tar­get, are we go­ing to ratchet up our re­new­able en­ergy tar­gets, are we go­ing to set an ab­so­lute car­bon emis­sions re­duc­tion tar­get? These ques­tions now be­come more rel­e­vant,” he said.</p>
    <p>So can China achieve its car­bon neu­tral­ity tar­get?</p>
    <p>“Achiev­ing car­bon neu­tral­ity re­quires elim­i­nat­ing most fos­sil fuel use in power gen­er­a­tion, heat­ing, in­dus­try and trans­port,” Mr Myl­lyvirta said.</p>
    <p>“With China hav­ing the world’s largest re­new­able en­ergy in­dus­try, in­vest­ment bud­get and in­dus­trial base, this is em­i­nently achiev­able,” he added.</p>
    <p>Tran­si­tion­ing to car­bon neu­tral­ity within a few decades could cost US$5.5 tril­lion (S$7.56 tril­lion), Bloomberg re­ported, quot­ing es­ti­mates from Wall Street re­search and bro­ker­age firm</p>
    <p>San­ford C. Bern­stein.</p>
    <p>“What’s be­ing con­tem­plated here has never been done be­fore,” said Bern­stein an­a­lyst Neil Bev­eridge.</p>
    <p>“The larger the en­ergy mix, the longer it takes to tran­si­tion. This is a mon­u­men­tal chal­lenge.”</p>
    <p>For now, an­a­lysts hope Mr Xi’s UN ad­dress will boost global cli­mate diplomacy and, pos­si­bly, restore the pre­vi­ous US-China cli­mate lead­er­ship un­der former US pres­i­dent Barack Obama and Mr Xi, a part­ner­ship re­garded as key to the suc­cess of the 2015 Paris cli­mate con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Mr Li said the idea of Mr Xi’s</p>
    <p>speech was “to con­trast Chi­nese cli­mate am­bi­tion with US cli­mate in­ac­tion”, but “also to fac­tor in a pos­si­ble Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion and the pos­si­bil­ity of en­gag­ing with that ad­min­is­tra­tion”, re­fer­ring to US pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>Mr David Waskow, in­ter­na­tional</p>
    <p>cli­mate direc­tor at the World Re­sources In­sti­tute, told The Straits Times: “This move by China has upped the ante for all ma­jor emit­ters. While China still needs to pro­vide de­tails and take am­bi­tious steps – es­pe­cially on its 2030 com­mit­ment and date for peak­ing emis­sions – the spot­light is now</p>
    <p>shin­ing on oth­ers to see if they will step for­ward.</p>
    <p>“The EU’s plan to en­hance its com­mit­ment un­der the Paris Agree­ment by De­cem­ber this year will sharpen that ques­tion even fur­ther,” he said.</p>
