    <p>In­dia’s Congress party faces fresh tur­moil af­ter an in­ter­nal mutiny threat­ened its hold on power in the cen­tral state of Ra­jasthan. It is the lat­est bout of trou­ble to hit the 135-year-old party, which has con­tin­ued to strug­gle to re­verse its de­clin­ing po­lit­i­cal for­tunes.</p>
    <p>Mr Sachin Pi­lot, 42, a well-known face of the party and a key sec­on­drung leader, was sacked yes­ter­day as deputy chief min­is­ter and Ra­jasthan Congress chief af­ter go­ing against se­nior leader Ashok Gehlot, the Ra­jasthan chief min­is­ter, po­ten­tially threat­en­ing the state gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>At least 16 Mem­bers of the Leg­isla­tive Assem­bly (MLA) left with him, weak­en­ing the state gov­ern­ment. It is un­clear whether Mr Pi­lot has the sup­port of more MLAs, which would be needed to top­ple the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The Congress is the main op­po­si­tion party of the coun­try but un­der In­dia’s fed­eral sys­tem – where every state has a gov­ern­ment – it is in power in five out of 29 states and the union ter­ri­tory of Puducherry.</p>
    <p>Congress spokesman Ran­deep Singh Sur­je­w­ala has ac­cused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of fo­ment­ing trou­ble.</p>
    <p>“I re­gret that Sachin Pi­lot and some of his as­so­ciates have been swayed by BJP’s plot and are now con­spir­ing to top­ple the Congress gov­ern­ment... It is un­ac­cept­able,” Mr Sur­je­w­ala told jour­nal­ists.</p>
    <p>The trou­ble in Ra­jasthan is just the lat­est in a string of prob­lems for the Congress party, which has been strug­gling for po­lit­i­cal rel­e­vance since 2014, when Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi first swept to power on a land­slide win.</p>
    <p>Mr Modi re­turned to of­fice with an even big­ger man­date in the 2019 gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Congress won just 52 out of 543 seats in the Lower House of Par­lia­ment last year, in con­trast to 303 seats won by Mr Modi’s BJP.</p>
    <p>Mr Rahul Gandhi, tak­ing re­spon­si­bil­ity for the party’s poor show­ing, quit as Congress pres­i­dent shortly af­ter the elec­tion re­sults last year, leav­ing his mother, So­nia, 73, to re­turn as pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>A weak­ened cen­tral lead­er­ship has re­sulted in in­fight­ing, par­tic­u­larly among state lead­ers, and a widen­ing rift be­tween se­nior and younger lead­ers.</p>
    <p>In March, the party suf­fered a po­lit­i­cal set­back af­ter Mr Jy­oti­ra­ditya Scin­dia re­signed, to­gether with his loy­al­ists, and joined the BJP, lead­ing to the fall of the Congress gov­ern­ment in Mad­hya Pradesh.</p>
    <p>Now, an­a­lysts are wait­ing to see if Mr Pi­lot will fol­low the same path.</p>
    <p>The Congress leader, whose fa­ther Ra­jesh Pi­lot was a lead­ing politi­cian in the party be­fore dy­ing in a car crash in 2000, has de­nied that he is join­ing the BJP.</p>
    <p>Mr Pi­lot, who was un­happy over not be­ing made chief min­is­ter, has gained much from the party, as many pointed out on so­cial me­dia when his po­lit­i­cal moves made head­line news.</p>
    <p>He be­came an MP at 26, a fed­eral min­is­ter at 32 and deputy chief min­is­ter at 40.</p>
    <p>But the lat­est de­vel­op­ments have trig­gered more dis­quiet within the Congress. And even loy­al­ists have been left won­der­ing whether the party would con­tinue on a down­ward spi­ral.</p>
    <p>“Wor­ried for our party, will we wake up af­ter all the horses have bolted from the sta­ble,” tweeted se­nior Congress leader Kapil Sibal.</p>
    <p>Still, the re­volt comes at a time when Mr Gandhi has been seek­ing po­lit­i­cal rel­e­vance, ques­tion­ing Prime Min­is­ter Modi over the han­dling of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the coun­try’s bor­der trou­bles with China, and In­dia’s eco­nomic trou­bles which have been deep­ened by a strin­gent lockdown, since lifted.</p>
    <p>Mr Gandhi has also gar­nered at­ten­tion with his se­ries of in­ter­views on Covid-19’s im­pact on the In­dian econ­omy with No­bel lau­re­ate Ab­hi­jit Ban­er­jee, In­dian econ­o­mist Raghu­ram Ra­jan and cor­po­rate hon­cho Rahul Ba­jaj. In the lat­est in­ter­view, he an­nounced that he would be shar­ing video mes­sages on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Mr Modi’s hold on power re­mains absolute, but many have seen an op­por­tu­nity for the Congress to chart a course for po­lit­i­cal re­vival. Mr Modi is fac­ing the tough­est pe­riod of his lead­er­ship with a health cri­sis trig­gered by the pan­demic and slow­ing eco­nomic growth.</p>
    <p>But po­lit­i­cal an­a­lysts said Mr Gandhi has to first ad­dress the lead­er­ship cri­sis within his party.</p>
    <p>The party has long de­pended on the Nehru Gandhi fam­ily, a po­lit­i­cal dy­nasty that has led the Congress to nu­mer­ous elec­toral wins and given In­dia three prime min­is­ters. Within the party, many be­lieve the dy­nasty is cru­cial for unity.</p>
    <p>“I think there is a need for some clar­ity within the Congress. The party re­quires a long-term strat­egy. And the first point in this strat­egy is the whole point of lead­er­ship. Is Congress mov­ing to­wards a post-dy­nasty lead­er­ship or does the party be­lieve it needs the dy­nasty to keep the party to­gether and main­tain unity of party?” said Dr San­deep Shas­tri, a po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist and pro vice-chan­cel­lor at Jain Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>“What­ever you see hap­pen­ing is the symp­tom. It’s not the dis­ease. When you search for the cause, it’s the lead­er­ship. Un­less lead­er­ship is clar­i­fied, you can’t take any­thing for­ward.”</p>
