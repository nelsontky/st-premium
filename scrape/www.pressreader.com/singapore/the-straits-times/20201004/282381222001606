    <p>I joined the Sin­ga­pore Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board (EDB) straight out of univer­sity in 1997. My first boss com­plained that man­ag­ing me was like try­ing to hold down a wild stal­lion. He ad­vised me to re­flect more and to please calm down.</p>
    <p>He called me a wild stal­lion be­cause I was dif­fi­cult to man­age. While I worked in­cred­i­bly long hours, some­times sleep­ing un­der my desk in the of­fice while hus­tling to bring good jobs into Sin­ga­pore, I did not take in­struc­tion well, choos­ing of­ten to do things my way.</p>
    <p>I was ar­ro­gant and brash in the way I in­ter­acted with col­leagues, which stemmed from deep in­se­cu­ri­ties about not be­ing good enough to work there.</p>
    <p>At the time, EDB schol­ars far out­num­bered non-schol­ars like me as new hires. I was in­tim­i­dated by col­leagues who had gone to Ivy League uni­ver­si­ties such as</p>
    <p>Har­vard and Yale, schools I had failed to get a schol­ar­ship to study at and never dreamt of ap­ply­ing to. Many of the schol­ars start­ing out with me at the same age had master’s de­grees, com­pared with my measly, ba­sic lo­cal de­gree.</p>
    <p>I knew my boss was right. How long could I pull 70-hour work weeks? My re­la­tion­ship with my then girl­friend, now wife, was on the verge of a break-up. I hardly saw my fam­ily, was a jerk in the of­fice and was deeply un­happy. The sit­u­a­tion was un­ten­able.</p>
    <p>Try­ing to fol­low my bosses’ ad­vice was an ex­er­cise in fu­til­ity and frus­tra­tion. Mind­ful­ness was not a cor­po­rate buzz­word then and there were few re­sources avail­able.</p>
    <p>There is per­haps noth­ing more frus­trat­ing than tak­ing the time to re­flect and fail­ing mis­er­ably at it. I strug­gled to fig­ure out how to start re­flect­ing, how to keep dis­trac­tions at bay, to quiet my mind for even one minute – but just kept fall­ing asleep.</p>
    <p>How I wish I had a copy of Har­vard Pro­fes­sor Joseph Badaracco’s best-sell­ing book, Step Back: How To Bring The Art Of Re­flec­tion Into Your Busy Life, back then.</p>
    <p>The slim book is writ­ten for the busy pro­fes­sional, with about 180 pages and five sim­ple chap­ters.</p>
    <p>Each chap­ter is writ­ten to be read dur­ing a com­mute to the of­fice.</p>
    <p>I re­cently had a chance to chat with Prof Badaracco, who teaches busi­ness ethics at Har­vard Busi­ness School and is the for­mer chair­man of the Har­vard Univer­sity Ad­vi­sory Com­mit­tee on Share­holder Re­spon­si­bil­ity, about his book.</p>
    <p>He de­scribes re­flec­tion as “step­ping back to grasp what re­ally mat­ters – about what you are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing, try­ing to un­der­stand, or do­ing”. He ad­vo­cates the de­vel­op­ment of a prac­ti­cal and ev­ery­day prac­tice of re­flec­tion that helps peo­ple to work and live bet­ter.</p>
    <p>I told him that as I read his book, I had im­me­di­ately re-ti­tled it in my mind as Re­flec­tion For Dum­mies Like Me. I was sur­prised that my al­ter­na­tive ti­tle did not in­sult him. He said that if he had his way, the book would have been called In­struc­tional Man­ual On Self-Re­flec­tion.</p>
    <p>In his decades teach­ing at Har­vard, he said he had en­coun­tered thou­sands of busy ex­ec­u­tives who needed help to find clar­ity and calm amid the tur­bu­lence of work and life, yet could not take the first sim­ple steps to­wards what they needed. He felt that life is messy and peo­ple need a prac­ti­cal guide to help them start the process of re­flec­tion.</p>
    <p>The short book took more than four years to write and is the dis­til­la­tion of 800 pages of per­sonal notes and 2,000 pages of tran­scripts from in-depth in­ter­views with 100 se­nior ex­ec­u­tives on how they ap­proach re­flec­tion.</p>
    <p>The four sim­ple ideas in the book are:</p>
    <p>• Aim for “good enough”. You can re­flect any­where and in any way. It does not have to be per­fect, just be sure to take the time to do it. • Down­shift oc­ca­sion­ally. Step back from what is keep­ing you busy and op­er­ate at a lower gear, so you can al­low your­self to be more open to thoughts that come up dur­ing that time.</p>
    <p>• Pon­der the hard is­sues. Con­sciously think through and an­a­lyse the dif­fi­cult top­ics in your life and work. Do not avoid them. • Pause and mea­sure up. Step back from the “busy­ness” and check what you are do­ing against ob­jec­tive, pro­fes­sional or in­spi­ra­tional role mod­els to see if you are head­ing in the right di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>Prof Badaracco ob­served that for highly suc­cess­ful peo­ple, their high stan­dards can be an im­ped­i­ment to tak­ing time to re­flect. They have a ten­dency to take their stan­dards at work and ap­ply these to how they are ap­proach­ing re­flec­tion. Their high stan­dards lead them to be self-crit­i­cal, which in turn causes them to stop re­flect­ing, be­cause they think they are not do­ing it right. Un­like in­cen­tives at work, the ben­e­fits of re­flec­tion are not im­me­di­ately tan­gi­ble, so they tend to put it off.</p>
    <p>His most im­por­tant ad­vice to re­flec­tion fail­ures such as my­self: “Even if you can­not do it well, you can still do it. Start with what­ever you are do­ing and try to do it a little bet­ter each day.”</p>
    <p>I found his per­spec­tive on re­flec­tion re­fresh­ing, in­clu­sive and wel­com­ing. He be­lieves that many peo­ple al­ready en­gage in some form of re­flec­tion in their daily lives as they think deeply about what they are do­ing: jour­nalling, pray­ing or even med­i­tat­ing. He en­cour­ages peo­ple to take his sim­ple prin­ci­ples and adapt them for their own use.</p>
    <p>De­spite the sput­ter­ing start to self-re­flec­tion at the start of my ca­reer, I was prompted to get se­ri­ous about the prac­tice five years ago when I watched a YouTube video of the late Min­is­ter Men­tor Lee Kuan Yew, shortly after he passed away in 2015.</p>
    <p>In the video, shot in Sin­ga­pore in Au­gust 2013, Mr Lee de­scribed how he used med­i­ta­tion when he en­coun­tered stress­ful sit­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>He said: “When I am stressed to make a de­ci­sion, I stop and med­i­tate. And at the end of the med­i­ta­tion, if I am still of the view that I should pro­ceed, then I pro­ceed.”</p>
    <p>He felt that the act of re­flec­tion pro­vided him with de­tach­ment from the emo­tional as­pects of de­ci­sion-mak­ing, al­low­ing him to make bet­ter de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee had started med­i­tat­ing more reg­u­larly be­cause of the strain of cop­ing with his wife’s ill­ness, prior to her death. He had been in­tro­duced to it by for­mer</p>
    <p>GIC chief in­vest­ment of­fi­cer Ng Kok Song, who had found med­i­ta­tion help­ful while car­ing for his can­cer-stricken wife for al­most two years.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng said med­i­ta­tion and re­flec­tion had given both men the op­por­tu­nity to ex­press a deep love for their wives and be with them as their phys­i­cal con­di­tion de­te­ri­o­rated. I was touched to hear him say that it al­lowed him and Mr Lee “to show our love to the per­son we love”.</p>
    <p>Some­how, watch­ing the two gi­ants talk about their love for their wives and share their jour­neys in self-re­flec­tion gave me the clar­ity and im­pe­tus to get se­ri­ous about the prac­tice.</p>
    <p>Since then, I have been med­i­tat­ing and re­flect­ing ev­ery morn­ing for about 10 min­utes, after I have had a chance to read, re­flect, and think about the day ahead. My jour­ney in self-re­flec­tion is still nascent, but I take heart in Prof Badaracco’s ad­vice “to do it a little bet­ter each day”.</p>
    <p>One hopes that through all this, the wild stal­lion will be tamer, more re­flec­tive and a little calmer.</p>
