    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s en­ergy pol­icy is premised on the prom­ise that ur­ban so­ci­eties can be the most en­ergy- and re­source-ef­fi­cient when cities, towns and set­tle­ments are well planned, or­gan­ised and run. Do­ing so would in­volve green­ing the pro­duc­tion, con­sump­tion and trans­port pro­cesses, with spe­cial em­pha­sis placed on how the coun­try pro­duces and stores en­ergy and on its en­ergy mix. Hap­pily, Sin­ga­pore pos­sesses one of the clean­est ways of pro­duc­ing en­ergy from fos­sil fu­els: 95 per cent of its en­ergy pro­duc­tion comes from the burn­ing of nat­u­ral gas. Nat­u­ral gas is the clean­est form of fos­sil fuel, but it is a fos­sil fuel none­the­less. Since the burn­ing of fos­sil fu­els pro­duces car­bon diox­ide – the main green­house gas driv­ing cli­mate change – nat­u­ral gas rep­re­sents a high bench­mark but one that can be ex­ceeded so that Sin­ga­pore can be in the van­guard of na­tions that have em­braced a green fu­ture in the mak­ing of poli­cies here and now.</p>
    <p>To­wards that end, a greener en­ergy plan was un­veiled at the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional En­ergy Week con­fer­ence ear­lier this week. The plan in­cludes a trial to im­port elec­tric­ity from Malaysia, a move which could pave the way for more re­new­able en­ergy im­ports from other na­tions in the re­gion. For a start, the two-year trial with Malaysia will in­volve about 100MW of elec­tric­ity im­ports, with re­new­able en­ergy sources be­ing the pre­ferred op­tion. Sin­ga­pore also will ramp up its ef­forts to in­stall more so­lar pan­els here, and in­vest in re­search on low-car­bon en­ergy so­lu­tions. Th­ese ini­tia­tives re­flect a marked de­gree of ur­gency, and at­ten­dant at­ten­tion to long-term con­sis­tency in en­ergy pol­icy, in Sin­ga­pore’s at­tempt to de­car­bonise its en­ergy mix.</p>
    <p>The ex­er­cise can­not be car­ried out all at once. Hence, even as Sin­ga­pore makes the shift to clean en­ergy sources such as so­lar power, liq­ue­fied nat­u­ral gas (LNG) will con­tinue to form a sub­stan­tial part of its en­ergy mix in the near fu­ture. How­ever, the fact that LNG makes up 95 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s en­ergy mix, up from 26 per cent when it was first used here in 2001, in­di­cates the over­all di­rec­tion in which the coun­try is mov­ing: to­wards a fu­ture pow­ered by greener en­ergy. That hori­zon must not be lost sight of.</p>
    <p>The na­tional en­vi­ron­men­tal ef­fort can­not suc­ceed with­out the ac­tive par­tic­i­pa­tion of cit­i­zens aided by the in­no­va­tive poli­cies of the state. Re­duc­ing de­pen­dence on air-con­di­tion­ing by util­is­ing the pos­si­bil­i­ties of nat­u­ral cool­ing is an ex­am­ple of day-to-day prac­tices that make a col­lec­tive dif­fer­ence to the eco­log­i­cal fu­ture of a trop­i­cal is­land. Such per­sonal choices can sup­port of­fi­cial ini­tia­tives in us­ing nat­u­ral ven­ti­la­tion, so­lar pan­els and smart light­ing tech­nolo­gies, as well as plant­ing both ver­ti­cal and hor­i­zon­tal green­ery so as to re­duce en­ergy con­sump­tion in liv­ing spa­ces. Ev­ery ci­ti­zen has a stake in green Sin­ga­pore.</p>
