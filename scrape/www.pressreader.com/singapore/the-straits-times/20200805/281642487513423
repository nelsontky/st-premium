    <p>The Sri Lankan prison in­mate who was the sole com­mu­nity case on Mon­day had served a four-week jail sen­tence for over­stay­ing in Sin­ga­pore with­out a valid pass and was await­ing repa­tri­a­tion when he tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>He was also ad­mit­ted to Changi Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal dur­ing his jail term for dengue and went for a re­lated med­i­cal re­view at Khoo Teck Puat Hos­pi­tal af­ter his sen­tence ended.</p>
    <p>This is ac­cord­ing to replies by the Sin­ga­pore Prison Ser­vice and Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Au­thor­ity (ICA) last night to queries from The Straits Times on the 26-year-old in­mate.</p>
    <p>They said he is cur­rently well, and noted that the man had un­der­gone at least three swab tests dur­ing his stay at Changi Prison Com­plex and had his tem­per­a­ture taken three times a day while he was in ICA’s cus­tody.</p>
    <p>It is un­clear where he was in­fected with the coro­n­avirus, but he has been clas­si­fied by the Min­istry of Health (MOH) as a lo­cal com­mu­nity case.</p>
    <p>Two other in­mates who were ad­mit­ted last Thurs­day with the Sri Lankan pa­tient were iso­lated in the same cell with him dur­ing a 14-day seg­re­ga­tion pe­riod for all newly ad­mit­ted in­mates.</p>
    <p>They are be­ing closely mon­i­tored and kept sep­a­rate from the rest of the prison pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The two tested nega­tive for</p>
    <p>Covid-19 and will un­dergo an­other swab test at the end of their cur­rent iso­la­tion pe­riod for be­ing close con­tacts of the pa­tient.</p>
    <p>The Sri Lankan man is the sixth case to be linked to pris­ons to date. Four in­mates and one staff nurse were pre­vi­ously con­firmed to have con­tracted the virus.</p>
    <p>This lat­est case is un­re­lated to the five cases be­fore, the prison ser­vice and ICA said, and noted that the five ear­lier cases have fully re­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a Hindu temple was added to a list of places vis­ited by Covid-19 cases while they were still in­fec­tious, MOH said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Holy Tree Sri Bala­sub­ra­ma­niar Temple at 10 Yishun In­dus­trial Park A was vis­ited by at least one case last Fri­day from 7pm to 9pm.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions that Covid-19 cases have vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes to get those who were at these places to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>It has said that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and that there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned if needed.</p>
    <p>The full list is on MOH’s web­site. There were 295 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, in­clud­ing two com­mu­nity cases and seven im­ported ones.</p>
    <p>All seven im­ported cases re­cently ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore from In­dia, with the youngest be­ing a five-year-old boy, an In­dian na­tional, linked to a pre­vi­ous case.</p>
    <p>The two com­mu­nity cases are a 31-year-old Sin­ga­porean woman and a 46-year-old Bangladesh­i work per­mit holder.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 286 cases, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 53,346.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity dur­ing a week has de­creased from four cases two weeks ago to two in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity dur­ing a week has also fallen from a daily av­er­age of two cases to one over the same pe­ri­ods.</p>
