    <p>• In all like­li­hood, Olivier Giroud will be on the bench when Chelsea host Leeds in the Premier League to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>The France striker has yet to start in the English top flight this season, with man­ager Frank Lam­pard pre­fer­ring to go with Tammy Abra­ham and Timo Werner up front. That has led to spec­u­la­tion over his fu­ture as his con­tract ex­pires next sum­mer and re­ports sug­gest he will move when the trans­fer win­dow opens next month so as to se­cure his place in Les Bleus’ Euro 2020 squad.</p>
    <p>But de­spite his lack of play­ing time, he re­tains the ut­most re­spect of Lam­pard, who be­lieves that the club’s younger players should look up to the 34-year-old as a shin­ing ex­am­ple of pro­fes­sion­al­ism.</p>
    <p>Giroud on Wed­nes­day be­came the old­est player to score a Cham­pi­ons League hat-trick and also the old­est to do it in the Euro­pean Cup since Hun­gary’s Ferenc Puskas in Septem­ber 1965.</p>
    <p>He net­ted all the goals i n Chelsea’s 4-0 de­mo­li­tion of Sevilla, en­sur­ing the vis­i­tors, who al­ready qual­i­fied for the knock­out stage, fin­ished top of Group E ahead of the hosts with a match to spare.</p>
    <p>On Giroud, who started for just the sec­ond time in all com­pe­ti­tions this term, Lam­pard said: “He is the ul­ti­mate pro­fes­sional.</p>
    <p>“He isn’t al­ways a reg­u­lar but his per­for­mances have shown that he is a great sign for young players to keep train­ing well. It was an amaz­ing per­for­mance, to score four goals in the Cham­pi­ons League is a fan­tas­tic achieve­ment.</p>
    <p>“It was a com­plete per­for­mance and I am de­lighted for him.”</p>
    <p>It was only the sec­ond time Giroud had net­ted four times – the first was in the French sec­ond di­vi­sion for Tours against Ar­les-Avi­gnon in 2009 – and he ac­knowl­edged the mem­o­rable night.</p>
    <p>“When I am on the pitch I just try to en­joy it,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I try to be pa­tient and keep the faith, I just try to give some­thing else to the team. Some­times, you feel any­thing can hap­pen and this night was one of them.”</p>
    <p>The vet­eran’s dis­play led pun­dits to in­sist that he de­served a start­ing place against Leeds, with Glenn Hod­dle call­ing him “out of this world”.</p>
    <p>The former Tot­ten­ham for­ward said: “He has to start at the week­end now, he’s scored four goals... He is a great as­set and peo­ple look at him as just a tar­get man but he is so much more than that.”</p>
    <p>Former Liver­pool and Blues mid­fielder Joe Cole also took a swipe at Arse­nal, who let him go for £18 mil­lion (S$32.3 mil­lion) in 2018, adding: “If you’re an Arse­nal fan, you must be sat at home think­ing why we let him go.”</p>
