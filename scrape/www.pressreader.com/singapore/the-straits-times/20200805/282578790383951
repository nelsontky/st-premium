    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • The ex­clu­sive group of film jour­nal­ists that awards the Golden Globes was ac­cused on Mon­day of sab­o­tag­ing non-mem­bers while gorg­ing on lav­ish perks and un­par­al­leled ac­cess to Hol­ly­wood stars.</p>
    <p>An an­titrust law­suit, filed against the Hol­ly­wood For­eign Press As­so­ci­a­tion (HFPA), said the or­gan­i­sa­tion il­le­gally mo­nop­o­lised en­ter­tain­ment re­port­ing in Los An­ge­les while cre­at­ing near-im­pos­si­ble bar­ri­ers to en­try for new mem­bers.</p>
    <p>“All year long, HFPA mem­bers en­joy all-ex­penses-paid trips to film fes­ti­vals around the world, where the stu­dios treat t hem lav­ishly and ac­com­mo­date their every de­sire,” said the suit brought by Nor­we­gian jour­nal­ist Kjer­sti Flaa.</p>
    <p>“Qual­i­fied ap­pli­cants for ad­mis­sion to the HFPA are vir­tu­ally al­ways re­jected be­cause the ma­jor­ity of its 87 mem­bers are un­will­ing to share or di­lute the enor­mous eco­nomic ben­e­fits they re­ceive as mem­bers,” it adds.</p>
    <p>The HFPA wields con­sid­er­able power due to its an­nual Golden Globes – one of Tin­sel­town’s big­gest and glitzi­est award shows – which is seen as a key step to suc­cess at the all-im­por­tant Os­cars.</p>
    <p>Yet, its mem­ber­ship – which ex­clu­sively de­cides who walks away with the cov­eted Globes each year – is shrouded in mys­tery.</p>
    <p>Though some mem­bers work for well-re­spected for­eign me­dia out­lets, many are free­lancers writ­ing for ob­scure publi­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>The law­suit de­tails in­stances of mem­bers be­ing wined and dined by Hol­ly­wood stu­dios, in­clud­ing a Dis­ney press trip to a Sin­ga­pore five-star ho­tel last year.</p>
    <p>“The stu­dios, of course, re­sent hav­ing to lav­ish enor­mous sums of money on, and be­ing re­quired to cater to, the de­sires of a few dozen age­ing jour­nal­ists who are reg­u­larly heard snor­ing through screen­ings, but given the im­por­tance of the Golden Globes, they see no way to end the farce,” says the law­suit.</p>
    <p>Ms Flaa, the plain­tiff, ap­plied for mem­ber­ship in 2018 and last year, but was re­jected both times.</p>
    <p>In her law­suit, she ac­cuses ri­val Scan­di­na­vian jour­nal­ists of block­ing her en­try even though she is qual­i­fied to join ac­cord­ing to HFPA cri­te­ria.</p>
    <p>Any for­eign j our­nal­ist seek­ing en­try must be spon­sored by two mem­bers and a new­comer’s ap­pli­ca­tion can be re­jected if one mem­ber of the as­so­ci­a­tion ve­toes it.</p>
    <p>The HFPA, which has yet to be served with the com­plaint, de­nied the al­le­ga­tions and ac­cused Ms Flaa of “on­go­ing at­tempts to shake down the HFPA”.</p>
    <p>“The HFPA has re­fused to pay ran­som, telling Ms Flaa that mem­ber­ship was not gained through in­tim­i­da­tion,” the group said in a state­ment to Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>“Ms Flaa and her at­tor­ney are now ask­ing a court to or­der her into the or­gan­i­sa­tion and pay her.</p>
    <p>“The HFPA takes se­ri­ously its obli­ga­tions as an or­gan­i­sa­tion and its ded­i­ca­tion to for­eign jour­nal­ism and phi­lan­thropy and it will vig­or­ously de­fend against these base­less claims.”</p>
