    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Mr Don­ald Trump said on Sun­day that his per­sonal lawyer Rudy Gi­u­liani has tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, the lat­est mem­ber of the US Pres­i­dent’s in­ner cir­cle – where mask wear­ing is rare – to con­tract the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>The 76-year-old for­mer New York City mayor’s age puts him in a high-risk group, and the New York Times and ABC re­ported that he was hos­pi­talised on Sun­day in Wash­ing­ton as the United States faces a record surge in coro­n­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>Mr Gi­u­liani’s di­ag­no­sis comes af­ter he had been criss-cross­ing the coun­try, lead­ing the Pres­i­dent’s de­fi­ant – and un­suc­cess­ful – ef­fort to undo Mr Joe Bi­den’s vic­tory in the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing his trav­els, Mr Gi­u­liani has been seen fre­quently with­out a mask: Last Wed­nes­day, he was at the Michi­gan state as­sem­bly in Lans­ing with his face un­cov­ered for a hear­ing last­ing over four hours.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, CNN showed footage of him in At­lanta walk­ing mask­less down a hall, chat­ting with sev­eral other peo­ple whose faces were un­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>“Gi­u­liani, by far the great­est mayor in the his­tory of NYC, and who has been work­ing tire­lessly ex­pos­ing the most cor­rupt elec­tion (by far!) in the his­tory of the USA, has tested pos­i­tive for the China virus,” Mr Trump tweeted, us­ing a term he ap­plies to the coro­n­avirus that has been widely de­cried as racist and fan­ning con­spir­acy the­o­ries.</p>
    <p>“Get bet­ter soon Rudy, we will carry on!!!” the Pres­i­dent added.</p>
    <p>A few hours ear­lier, Mr Gi­u­liani was in­ter­viewed live on Fox News and showed no signs of the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s le­gal team said in a state­ment that Mr Gi­u­liani tested neg­a­tive twice be­fore his most re­cent trip and “did not ex­pe­ri­ence any symp­toms or test pos­i­tive for Covid-19 un­til more than 48 hours af­ter his re­turn”.</p>
    <p>Other mem­bers of the l egal team will fol­low their doc­tors’ or­ders and Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion guide­lines on self-iso­la­tion and test­ing, the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>Mr Gi­u­liani tweeted on Sun­day that he was “get­ting great care and feel­ing good”. “Re­cov­er­ing quickly and keep­ing up with ev­ery­thing,” he said.</p>
    <p>The lawyer’s di­ag­no­sis came a day af­ter the Pres­i­dent, who has long played down the sever­ity of the pan­demic and even mocked those who wear masks, held his first big po­lit­i­cal rally since the elec­tion – be­fore a tightly packed crowd of thou­sands of largely un­masked sup­port­ers in Ge­or­gia.</p>
    <p>White House coro­n­avirus re­sponse co­or­di­na­tor Deb­o­rah Birx ex­pressed frus­tra­tion on Sun­day at anti-mask sen­ti­ment in the US. “I hear com­mu­nity mem­bers... par­rot­ing back that masks don’t work,” she told NBC’s Meet The Press. “They are wrong.”</p>
