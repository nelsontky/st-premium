    <p>The Court of Ap­peal has dis­missed a chal­lenge to the con­sti­tu­tional va­lid­ity of a law re­quir­ing or­gan­is­ers of public as­sem­blies to ob­tain po­lice per­mits.</p>
    <p>So­cial worker and ac­tivist Jolo­van Wham had con­tended that the per­mit re­quire­ment un­der the Public Or­der Act (POA) vi­o­lated Ar­ti­cle 14 of the Con­sti­tu­tion, which pro­tects the right to peace­ful assem­bly. He made the ar­gu­ment in his ap­peal against his con­vic­tion and sen­tenc­ing in a case in­volv­ing a 2016 event that he or­gan­ised, which fea­tured a speech by Hong Kong ac­tivist Joshua Wong de­liv­ered live over video con­fer­enc­ing.</p>
    <p>The “Civil Disobe­di­ence and So­cial Move­ments” event was or­gan­ised by Wham for, in his words, the pur­pose of dis­cussing “the role of civil disobe­di­ence and democ­racy” in ef­fect­ing so­cial change.</p>
    <p>In its grounds of de­ci­sion re­leased yes­ter­day, the apex court noted that the rights con­ferred by Ar­ti­cle 14 are sub­ject to cer­tain re­stric­tions and are not un­lim­ited.</p>
    <p>The court – con­sist­ing of Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon and Judges of Ap­peal An­drew Phang, Ju­dith Prakash, Tay Yong Kwang and Steven Chong – also noted that the POA reg­u­lates which as­sem­blies re­quire a per­mit and the grounds for re­fus­ing to grant such a per­mit.</p>
    <p>The law sets out some ex­cep­tions for cer­tain events, in­clud­ing in­door public as­sem­blies or­gan­ised by and in­volv­ing only Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens. But the court said a</p>
    <p>per­mit was clearly re­quired for the event or­gan­ised by Wham as it in­volved a non-Sin­ga­porean po­lit­i­cal ac­tivist.</p>
    <p>Un­der Sec­tion 7(2) of the POA, the Com­mis­sioner of Po­lice may refuse to grant a per­mit for a public assem­bly if there are rea­son­able grounds to be­lieve one or more un­de­sir­able re­sults per­tain­ing to public or­der may oc­cur. This in­cludes public as­sem­blies that may be di­rected to­wards a po­lit­i­cal end and or­gan­ised by or in­volve the par­tic­i­pa­tion of non-cit­i­zens of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“It is, un­for­tu­nately, an in­escapable fact of mod­ern life that na­tional pol­i­tics any­where are often the tar­get of in­ter­fer­ence by for­eign en­ti­ties or in­di­vid­u­als who are pro­mot­ing their own agen­das,” said the Court of Ap­peal, not­ing that tech­nol­ogy al­lows this to be done from any­where in the world.</p>
    <p>In its judg­ment, the court said Sec­tion 7(2) of the POA “achieves a care­ful bal­ance be­tween the con­sti­tu­tional right to peace­ably as­sem­ble and the de­lin­eation of the re­stric­tion im­posed on that right”.</p>
    <p>It noted that al­though the law does not ex­empt events in­volv­ing for­eign­ers and the Con­sti­tu­tion does not ex­tend rights to for­eign­ers, the com­mis­sioner can still ex­er­cise dis­cre­tion to al­low such events if he be­lieves the na­ture of the assem­bly, the speaker or the topic will not pose any sort of a threat to public or­der.</p>
    <p>“It is worth re­it­er­at­ing that in the present case, (Wham) could have or­gan­ised the very same event on the very same topic at the very same public venue with­out hav­ing to ap­ply for a per­mit had all the speak­ers at the event been Sin­ga­pore­ans,” the court said.</p>
    <p>“In re­gard to set­ting up a per­mit scheme and the del­e­ga­tion of the per­mit grant­ing power to the com­mis­sioner, this is a wholly rea­son­able and well-trod­den ap­proach by Par­lia­ment.”</p>
    <p>Wham was rep­re­sented by Mr Eu­gene Thu­raisingam, Mr Suang Wi­jaya and Mr Jo­hannes Hadi of the Eu­gene Thu­raisingam law firm.</p>
    <p>Wham also ar­gued that the per­mit re­quire­ment sub­jects a cit­i­zen’s con­sti­tu­tional rights en­tirely to the com­mis­sioner’s act of grant­ing a per­mit even if the de­ci­sion not to grant the per­mit is made un­con­sti­tu­tion­ally. He said cit­i­zens who have their per­mit ap­pli­ca­tions de­nied have no real rem­edy to chal­lenge such de­ci­sions made in bad faith.</p>
    <p>The Court of Ap­peal said that if the com­mis­sioner had re­fused to grant his ap­pli­ca­tion for a per­mit, he could have ap­pealed to the min­is­ter or ap­plied for a ju­di­cial re­view.</p>
    <p>He could then have con­tended that the ac­tual ex­er­cise of the com­mis­sioner’s or min­is­ter’s dis­cre­tion not to grant the per­mit was tainted by bad faith, or by im­proper con­sid­er­a­tions, or was oth­er­wise un­con­sti­tu­tional.</p>
    <p>But Wham had never ap­plied for a per­mit in the first place, the court noted. “No ap­pli­ca­tion hav­ing been made, there was no de­ci­sion that could be im­pugned on any ba­sis.”</p>
