    <p>Just months af­ter show­cas­ing the world’s sec­ond-largest rough di­a­mond – the 1,758-carat Sewelo – in Sin­ga­pore, Louis Vuit­ton (LV) has brought an­other record-break­ing stone here.</p>
    <p>The 549-carat Sethunya is a crys­tal-clear di­a­mond of ex­cep­tional pu­rity, high lus­tre and high colour, and es­ti­mated to be one bil­lion to two bil­lion years old.</p>
    <p>It was dis­cov­ered on Feb 1 in di­a­mond min­ing com­pany Lu­cara’s Karowe Mine – the same mine where the Sewelo was un­earthed in April last year.</p>
    <p>The un­cut Sethunya was re­cov­ered un­bro­ken and pris­tine by a Motswana di­a­mond sorter, who re­port­edly screamed when she found it.</p>
    <p>LV bought the his­toric stone and named it Sethunya, which means “flower” in the Setswana lan­guage – a nod to the French l ux­ury house’s em­blem­atic Mono­gram flower.</p>
    <p>The two stones may have been dis­cov­ered in the same mine, but they could not be more dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>The Sewelo is a rar­ity for its size and is the sec­ond-largest rough di­a­mond in the world. The ice­ber­g­like Sethunya, though smaller in num­ber of carats, is dis­tinctly rare for its “re­mark­able con­sis­tency of ex­treme pu­rity and white­ness through­out the crys­tal”, ac­cord­ing to the French lux­ury house.</p>
    <p>It de­clined to re­veal the stones’ es­ti­mated value.</p>
    <p>From now till Mon­day, both are on show at Capella Sin­ga­pore as part of LV’s Stel­lar Times high jew­ellery show­case. View­ing is by ap­point­ment only.</p>
    <p>The newly un­veiled Stel­lar Times col­lec­tion fea­tures 90 ex­quis­ite pieces in­spired by a jour­ney through the cos­mos. Span­ning seven galac­tic themes, the pieces in­cor­po­rate pre­cious gems – in­clud­ing sap­phires, ru­bies and opals – into an ar­ray of chok­ers, rings, neck­laces and more.</p>
    <p>Still, the show steal­ers are the two mas­sive di­a­monds.</p>
    <p>Like yin and yang, the Sewelo and Sethunya cap­ti­vate from be­hind glass cases – one glint­ing through its black-car­bon coat­ing, the other a blind­ing white ves­sel of light. It seems serendip­i­tous that, un­earthed from the same mine, the two are sit­ting side by side in one ex­hi­bi­tion.</p>
    <p>The show­case is mak­ing lim­ited stops around the re­gion.</p>
    <p>LV has ac­knowl­edged that the hefty ac­qui­si­tions are a tes­ta­ment to the house’s de­sire to be a ma­jor player in high jew­ellery – com­pet­ing with play­ers such as Cartier and Bul­gari.</p>
    <p>Its strength lies in its his­tory of per­son­al­i­sa­tion. As with the</p>
    <p>Sewelo, LV is of­fer­ing clients the op­por­tu­nity to cus­tom-cut and pol­ish the Sethunya into be­spoke pieces once it finds its buyer.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the house, the Sethunya’s cut­ting pos­si­bil­i­ties are mul­ti­ple and could yield a di­a­mond of 200 carats or two 100-carat pol­ished di­a­monds i n the LV sig­na­ture cut.</p>
    <p>The mai­son prides it­self on of­fer­ing clients a trans­par­ent, per­son­alised process to cre­at­ing the fi­nal pieces – work­ing di­rectly with An­twerp-based di­a­mond cut­ters HB Com­pany and cut­ting out the mid­dle­man.</p>
    <p>LV’s chair­man and chief ex­ec­u­tive Michael Burke said: “I be­lieve this is what the fu­ture of jew­ellery is about. We pro­vide our clients with the unique op­por­tu­nity of be­ing i nvolved i n the cut­ting pro­cesses and the end-to-end jewel cre­ation.</p>
    <p>“By clearly es­tab­lish­ing the ori­gin and get­ting rid of me­di­a­tors in an of­ten se­cre­tive mar­ket, we of­fer them a truly un­prece­dented fine jew­ellery ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>Ms Mar­gaux Don­ck­ier, com­mu­ni­ca­tions and ex­ter­nal af­fairs di­rec­tor of HB An­twerp, added in a press re­lease: “To­day, con­sumers ex­pect trans­parency and sus­tain­abil­ity. They are aware of the ori­gin of prod­ucts, un­der what con­di­tions prod­ucts were man­u­fac­tured and how of­ten they were flown around the world be­fore ar­riv­ing at their des­ti­na­tion.”</p>
    <p>Mr Burke added: “Our clients are search­ing for unique­ness, some­thing that they can­not find any­where else. Glob­ally, there is an in­creased de­mand for one-of-akind cre­ations.”</p>
    <p>Clients in­ter­ested in view­ing the Sethunya di­a­mond and Stel­lar Times show­case can con­tact Louis Vuit­ton Client Ser­vices on 6788-3888.</p>
