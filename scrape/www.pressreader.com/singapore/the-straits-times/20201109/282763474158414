    <p>Au­thor De­bra Ann Fran­cisco still reads Harry Pot­ter books with her son, even though he is an ad­vanced reader at 11. They en­joy dis­cussing how scenes in the books are de­picted dif­fer­ently in the movies.</p>
    <p>“Talk­ing about books and their im­pact on us is just as im­por­tant as read­ing them. My years as a lit­er­a­ture teacher taught me this,” says the 44-year-old, who en­cour­ages par­ents to con­tinue read­ing with their kids even as they get older.</p>
    <p>Fran­cisco is the au­thor of Vinod And The Deep­avali Dishes and four other chil­dren’s books that teach kids about Sin­ga­pore’s di­verse food cul­ture. She is also the News-in-Education spe­cial­ist of The Straits Times Schools team.</p>
    <p>“I wanted to write a se­ries of sto­ries about her­itage food for chil­dren so par­ents could start con­ver­sa­tions about their own eth­nic cuisines and hope­fully in­volve their chil­dren in cook­ing these dishes in the kitchen,” says Fran­cisco, who has two older sons aged 18 and 16.</p>
    <p>For par­ents with younger chil­dren, she sug­gests cre­at­ing a daily rit­ual of read­ing and mak­ing it a spe­cial time for the fam­ily. “I used to pro­mote an­other book at the end of each day’s story time,” she re­calls. “This cre­ates an­tic­i­pa­tion for the next day’s read.”</p>
    <p>If your kid is a reluc­tant reader, be­gin a new book by talk­ing about the il­lus­tra­tions first.</p>
    <p>Ask your lit­tle one to guess what the story is about, from the pic­tures. See if that sparks any in­ter­est and then say: “Shall we see if our guesses are cor­rect? Let’s read this to find out.”</p>
    <p>And why not record both of you read­ing to­gether?</p>
    <p>“My youngest son used to love Owl Ba­bies by Martin Wad­dell when he was three, and could re­cite the story by heart. I recorded us read­ing to­gether, with him recit­ing the owl ba­bies’ di­a­logue,” says Fran­cisco.</p>
    <p>“He got a kick out of lis­ten­ing to his voice over and over again, and it makes for a lovely recorded me­mory, even years later.”</p>
    <p>This is the first of a weekly se­ries where ex­perts give tips on how to get kids to love read­ing.</p>
