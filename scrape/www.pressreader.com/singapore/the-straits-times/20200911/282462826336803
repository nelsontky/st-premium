    <p>Mr Jean-Christophe Babin, group chief ex­ec­u­tive of Bvlgari, ap­pears on my com­puter screen with the logo “Geneva Watch Days 2020” boldly em­bla­zoned on a white wall be­hind him.</p>
    <p>It is a Zoom in­ter­view and he wants to talk about the new watches the Ital­ian lux­ury house is rolling out at the unique watch fair which took place late last month – one he played a key role in or­gan­is­ing.</p>
    <p>Geneva Watch Days 2020 is the first or­gan­ised watch gather­ing for the year since Covid-19 caused the can­cel­la­tion of the world’s two big­gest an­nual watch fairs – Hour Uni­verse (for­merly known as Basel­world) and Watches & Won­ders Geneva in April and May.</p>
    <p>Be­liev­ing that watch brands must be proac­tive to sur­vive the cri­sis brought on by the pan­demic, Mr Babin rounded up 17 la­bels – in­clud­ing Bre­itling, Ulysse Nardin, MB&F and De Bethune – which were keen to hold meet­ings and show their new of­fer­ings in Geneva from Aug 26 to 29.</p>
    <p>A de­cen­tralised event held at mul­ti­ple lo­ca­tions, the fair fol­lowed mask-wear­ing and so­cial-dis­tanc­ing guide­lines, and was also open to the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>An es­ti­mated 100 re­tail­ers, 250 me­dia rep­re­sen­ta­tives, mostly from Europe, and nearly 1,000 mem­bers of the pub­lic re­port­edly at­tended the show.</p>
    <p>For over­seas re­tail­ers and watch jour­nal­ists who could not make it to the event, brands took to Zoom, Google Meet and other plat­forms to in­tro­duce their nov­el­ties.</p>
    <p>Un­sur­pris­ingly, “phy­gi­tal” – which mar­ries on­line and off­line en­vi­ron­ments – was the buzz­word of the event.</p>
    <p>Sit­ting in a suite at the RitzCarl­ton with a high-tech set-up of cam­eras, lights and mi­cro­phones, Mr Babin says he is chuffed with Geneva Watch Days.</p>
    <p>“We are proud of our­selves. The weather is beau­ti­ful, we do what we want. This is self-man­aged and it is low-cost. It cost us only 5 per cent of what it would have cost us in Basel­world or Watches & Won­ders,” says the Bvlgari head hon­cho, whose brand re­port­edly paid 5 mil­lion Swiss francs (S$7.5 mil­lion) for its booth at Basel­world last year.</p>
    <p>He says it is im­por­tant to be bullish and not give up on this year de­spite the pan­demic badly af­fect­ing the lux­ury watch sec­tor, which is suf­fer­ing as the Chi­nese – the in­dus­try’s big­gest cus­tomers – could not travel or shop.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Fed­er­a­tion of the Swiss Watch In­dus­try, the value of Swiss watch ex­ports to the end of July this year was down by 33 per cent year over year.</p>
    <p>But there is a bright spot: Sta­tis­tics showed that shop­ping for lux­ury items picked up in main­land China in June and July.</p>
    <p>The way Mr Babin sees it, the watch in­dus­try is now di­vided into two fac­tions: “the sleep­ing brands and the bullish brands”.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously, Bvlgari has not only de­cided to be on the bullish side but also to be its leader,” he says.</p>
    <p>While he says this year will be one of neg­a­tive growth for the in­dus­try, those who are in­no­vat­ing and rein­vest­ing in the mar­ket will get their mar­ket share for the rest of the year.</p>
    <p>“There is still a big op­por­tu­nity be­cause we have Golden Week in Asia, Thanks­giv­ing i n Amer­ica, Christ­mas and New Year in Europe and Chi­nese New Year, so there are still four or five good months left.”</p>
    <p>Bullish brands who con­tinue to in­no­vate and in­vest in mar­ket­ing and train­ing will be the win­ners, he notes. “And those who sleep will lose fur­ther.”</p>
