    <p>DUBAI • A Saudi court has sen­tenced prom­i­nent women’s rights ac­tivist Lou­jain al-Hathloul to nearly six years in prison, her fam­ily said, after her con­vic­tion in a trial that has drawn in­ter­na­tional con­dem­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Mon­day’s ver­dict and sen­tence pose a chal­lenge to Crown Prince Mo­hammed bin Sal­man’s re­la­tion­ship with US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den, who has crit­i­cised Riyadh’s hu­man rights record.</p>
    <p>Hathloul, 31, who has been held since 2018 fol­low­ing her ar­rest along with sev­eral other women’s rights ac­tivists, will ap­peal against the sen­tence, her sis­ter said.</p>
    <p>She was charged with seek­ing to change the Saudi po­lit­i­cal sys­tem and harm­ing na­tional se­cu­rity, Saudi news­pa­pers Sabq and alShark al-Awsat said, un­der broad counter-ter­ror­ism laws.</p>
    <p>The court sus­pended two years and 10 months of her sen­tence of five years and eight months – most al­ready served since her ar­rest on May 15, 2018 – with a con­di­tional re­lease to fol­low, Hathloul’s sis­ter, Ms Lina, said.</p>
    <p>She could there­fore be re­leased by next March, with a re­turn to prison pos­si­ble if she com­mits any crime, the news­pa­pers said.</p>
    <p>Hathloul was also banned from travel for five years, Ms Lina said, adding that the ac­tivist cried when she was sen­tenced.</p>
    <p>“My sis­ter is not a ter­ror­ist, she is an ac­tivist. To be sen­tenced for her ac­tivism for the very re­forms that MBS and the Saudi king­dom so proudly tout is the ul­ti­mate hypocrisy,” she said in a state­ment, re­fer­ring to the prince by his ini­tials.</p>
    <p>Mr Cale Brown, spokesman for the US State De­part­ment, said the United States was “con­cerned by re­ports” of Hathloul’s sen­tence.</p>
    <p>“We’ve em­pha­sised the im­por­tance of free ex­pres­sion and peace­ful ac­tivism in Saudi Ara­bia as it ad­vances women’s rights.</p>
    <p>“We look for­ward to her an­tic­i­pated early re­lease in 2021,” he said on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s in­com­ing na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser Jake Sul­li­van ap­peared to reaf­firm on Twit­ter that the ad­min­is­tra­tion plans to el­e­vate hu­man rights is­sues in re­la­tions with Riyadh.</p>
    <p>Hathloul’s sen­tenc­ing “for sim­ply ex­er­cis­ing her uni­ver­sal rights is un­just and trou­bling”, Mr Sul­li­van said in a tweet.</p>
    <p>“As we have said, the Bi­den-Har­ris ad­min­is­tra­tion will stand up against hu­man rights vi­o­la­tions wher­ever they oc­cur.”</p>
    <p>United Na­tions hu­man rights ex­perts have called the charges “spu­ri­ous”. The UN hu­man rights of­fice said the con­vic­tion was “deeply trou­bling” and called for Hathloul’s ur­gent re­lease.</p>
    <p>Rights groups and her fam­ily say Hathloul, who cam­paigned for women’s right to drive and to end the king­dom’s male guardian­ship sys­tem, was sub­jected to abuse, in­clud­ing elec­tric shocks, wa­ter­board­ing, flog­ging and sex­ual as­sault. The Saudi author­i­ties have de­nied the charges.</p>
    <p>In 2019, Hathloul re­fused to re­scind her al­le­ga­tions of tor­ture in ex­change for early re­lease, her fam­ily has said. A court last week dis­missed the al­le­ga­tions, cit­ing a lack of ev­i­dence.</p>
