    <p>PARIS • French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron is “very shocked” by images pur­port­ing to show a black mu­sic pro­ducer be­ing beaten and racially abused by Paris po­lice, BFM TV re­ported, quot­ing com­ments from the pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties are in­ves­ti­gat­ing al­le­ga­tions that the mu­sic pro­ducer, who has given his iden­tity as Mr Michel, was as­saulted and abused dur­ing a po­lice check.</p>
    <p>The beat­ing at the en­trance of a build­ing was cap­tured on CCTV and mo­bile phone. Clips of the in­ci­dent were cir­cu­lated on­line and made head­line news on French TV chan­nels.</p>
    <p>The al­leged at­tack on Mr Michel risks in­flam­ing racial ten­sion in France, with al­le­ga­tions of re­peated po­lice bru­tal­ity against black and eth­nic com­mu­ni­ties at the fore­front of many peo­ple’s minds after the death of black Amer­i­can Ge­orge Floyd in Min­neapo­lis in May sparked the “Black Lives Mat­ter” move­ment.</p>
    <p>Paris po­lice had al­ready faced crit­i­cism this week after so­cial me­dia pho­tos and videos showed of­fi­cers hit­ting pro­test­ers as they cleared out an il­le­gal mi­grants camp­site in a cen­tral Paris square.</p>
    <p>The mu­sic pro­ducer told re­porters he was jumped on by po­lice at his stu­dio in Paris’s 17th ar­rondisse­ment on Nov 21.</p>
    <p>He said he had been walk­ing in the street with­out a face mask – against French Covid-19 health pro­to­cols – and, upon see­ing a po­lice car, went into his nearby stu­dio to avoid get­ting a fine.</p>
    <p>He said the po­lice then fol­lowed him in­side and be­gan to as­sault and racially abuse him.</p>
    <p>In­te­rior Min­is­ter Ger­ald Dar­manin told France 2 tele­vi­sion on Thurs­day that the of­fi­cers would be sanc­tioned if the al­leged wrong­do­ing was con­firmed.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent occurred amid con­tro­versy over a draft law that would limit jour­nal­ists’ abil­ity to show images of French po­lice of­fi­cers at work.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to protests and com­plaints from free ex­pres­sion ad­vo­cates, the prime min­is­ter’s of­fice said on Thurs­day that it would set up an in­de­pen­dent com­mis­sion tasked with propos­ing a new ver­sion of the leg­is­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Some Black Lives Mat­ter protests broke out in Paris in June, a month after the death of Mr Floyd after a white po­lice of­fi­cer knelt on his neck in the street for nearly nine min­utes in the course of ar­rest­ing him.</p>
    <p>The out­rage gen­er­ated by Mr Floyd’s death has res­onated in France, par­tic­u­larly in de­prived city sub­urbs where po­lice of­ten clash with youths from eth­nic mi­nor­ity background­s.</p>
    <p>The protests in Paris in June fo­cused on un­solved cases of peo­ple dy­ing dur­ing po­lice oper­a­tions, among them Mr Adama Traore, who died in po­lice de­ten­tion near Paris in 2016.</p>
