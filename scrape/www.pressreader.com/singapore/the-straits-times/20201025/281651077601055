    <p>Two of the 14 new cases re­ported by the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day worked at Changi Air­port Ter­mi­nal 3. Th­ese two com­mu­nity cases are un­linked.</p>
    <p>One is a se­cu­rity of­fi­cer at T3, who had gone to work be­fore hospi­tal ad­mis­sion. He also vis­ited the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Eye Cen­tre for treat­ment of a non-re­lated med­i­cal con­di­tion. The other is a screener and swab as­sis­tant at Raf­fles Med­i­cal in T3, who had gone to work prior to hospi­tal ad­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>“While both cases work at T3, they had not in­ter­acted with each other, and epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions so far have not es­tab­lished any link be­tween them,” MOH said in a state­ment last night. As a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure, how­ever, all in­di­vid­u­als work­ing at T3 who may have con­tact with trav­ellers will be tested for Covid-19, it added.</p>
    <p>As travel vol­ume is ex­pected to pick up in the com­ing months, MOH said it has been in talks with pub­lic agencies to ramp up ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of front-line staff work­ing at Changi Air­port. More de­tails will be pro­vided later.</p>
    <p>Places vis­ited by the new Covid-19 pa­tients while they were still in­fec­tious in­clude FairPrice Finest at T3 and Jurong Point.</p>
    <p>A third lo­cally trans­mit­ted case re­sides in a dor­mi­tory. He was de­tected through the bi­weekly ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing 11 cases were im­ported – they were three Sin­ga­pore­ans, a per­ma­nent res­i­dent, three work per­mit hold­ers, two long-term visit pass hold­ers, a short-term visit pass holder and a stu­dent’s pass holder. They re­turned from In­dia, the Philip­pines, In­done­sia and France. All had been placed on stay­home no­tices upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore and were tested then.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has de­creased from four cases in the week be­fore, to three in the past week. But the num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has in­creased from one in the week be­fore, to three in the past week. With 12 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,829 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the disease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 53 pa­tients re­main in hospi­tal, while 40 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 28 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
