    <p>The lead­er­ship con­test to suc­ceed Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe is shap­ing up as a three-horse race, with other hopefuls fall­ing by the way­side af­ter the rul­ing Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party (LDP) opted for a scaled-down elec­toral process.</p>
    <p>Chief Cab­i­net Sec­re­tary Yoshi­hide Suga, 71, is the run­away favourite, hav­ing se­cured the back­ing of four ma­jor fac­tions in the LDP. He is set to for­mally an­nounce his can­di­dacy to­day.</p>
    <p>Two other con­tenders – former for­eign min­is­ter Fu­mio Kishida, 63, and former de­fence chief Shigeru Ishiba, 63 – yes­ter­day an­nounced their in­ten­tion to con­test the polls.</p>
    <p>Mr Kishida, who now chairs the LDP Pol­icy Re­search Coun­cil, touted his ex­pe­ri­ence on both do­mes­tic is­sues and for­eign af­fairs, say­ing that made him an all­rounded can­di­date.</p>
    <p>Mr Ishiba, who is pop­u­lar with the pub­lic for his em­pa­thetic de­meanour, is seen as a rene­gade within the LDP for his un­abashed crit­i­cism of Mr Abe.</p>
    <p>He im­plied at a news con­fer­ence that high-handed gov­er­nance had led to a se­ries of crony­ism scan­dals and an im­pres­sion that the govern­ment was in its own ivory tower.</p>
    <p>“Pol­i­tics that do not be­lieve in the peo­ple can­not be trusted by the peo­ple,” he said. “It is our sin­cere and hum­ble re­spon­si­bil­ity to en­act poli­cies with the con­sen­sus and the em­pa­thy of the peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ishiba is by far the pub­lic’s favourite, out­polling Mr Suga in two me­dia opin­ion sur­veys over the week­end by more than 10 per­cent­age points each.</p>
    <p>He is also pop­u­lar among the 1.09 mil­lion rank-and-file LDP mem­bers, who will not get a chance to choose their leader in the elec­tion set to take place on Sept 14.</p>
    <p>The LDP, at a meet­ing of its gen­eral coun­cil, the high­est per­ma­nent de­ci­sion-mak­ing body in the party, favoured a stream­lined con­test to choose a suc­ces­sor to Mr Abe who will serve the re­main­der of the prime min­is­ter’s term as LDP pres­i­dent, which will ex­pire in Sep­tem­ber next year.</p>
    <p>The party’s 394 elected MPs in the Diet will get to cast their vote, along with three del­e­gates from each of the 47 pre­fec­ture chap­ters.</p>
    <p>This comes de­spite lob­by­ing by young LDP politi­cians, in­clud­ing En­vi­ron­ment Min­is­ter Shin­jiro Koizumi, as well as Mr Kishida and Mr Ishiba, for a full vote.</p>
    <p>Some lo­cal chap­ters, sen­si­tive to a back­lash, will hold pri­mary elec­tions to de­cide how to dis­trib­ute their three votes, me­dia re­ported.</p>
    <p>LDP gen­eral coun­cil chair­man Shu­nichi Suzuki told re­porters that the party saw no choice but to adopt an emer­gency process so as not to leave a po­lit­i­cal vac­uum, adding that the usual com­plete elec­toral process could take up to two months. This was also nec­es­sary tak­ing into con­sid­er­a­tion the health of Mr Abe, who abruptly quit last Fri­day over a flare-up of a chronic health con­di­tion, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Suzuki noted that the Prime Min­is­ter is stay­ing on un­til a suc­ces­sor is found.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral po­ten­tial can­di­dates threw in the towel yes­ter­day fol­low­ing the party’s de­ci­sion. They in­cluded De­fence Min­is­ter Taro Kono, For­eign Min­is­ter Toshim­itsu Motegi, as well as former in­ter­nal af­fairs min­is­ter Seiko Noda and former de­fence chief To­momi Inada.</p>
    <p>The Nikkei re­ported yes­ter­day that Mr Abe has tac­itly nod­ded in favour of Mr Suga, who has been his trusted lieu­tenant since he be­came Prime Min­is­ter in De­cem­ber 2012. This is also de­spite Mr Abe’s pub­lic back­ing pre­vi­ously for Mr Kishida as his ideal suc­ces­sor.</p>
    <p>Dr Sota Kato, a re­search di­rec­tor at The Tokyo Foun­da­tion for Pol­icy Re­search think-tank, told The Straits Times: “I think the game is over. One of the re­main­ing ques­tions is can Kishida and Ishiba main­tain their face so that they can rechal­lenge per­haps next year.”</p>
    <p>Sophia Univer­sity po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Koichi Nakano added: “Abe re­ally does not want to have his legacy de­nied. He has been pushed to the cor­ner by Covid-19 and by a se­ries of scan­dals, but who bet­ter to de­fend this legacy and to carry on than Suga, who has been by Abe’s side for the last eight years?”</p>
