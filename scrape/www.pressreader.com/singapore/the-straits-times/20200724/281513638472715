    <p>China is said to be mov­ing to re­tal­i­ate against the United States for or­der­ing its Hous­ton con­sulate shut, with ei­ther the US con­sulate in Chengdu or Hong Kong likely to be the tar­get.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong news out­let South China Morn­ing Post, cit­ing a source briefed on the de­ci­sion, said the US con­sulate in Chengdu is the prime tar­get.</p>
    <p>But spec­u­la­tion is rife in China that the Hong Kong con­sulate is the most prob­a­ble tar­get.</p>
    <p>The US also has con­sulates in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenyang and Wuhan, and an em­bassy in Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>In a sharp es­ca­la­tion of ten­sions be­tween Wash­ing­ton and Bei­jing, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion no­ti­fied China on Wed­nes­day that it had with­drawn con­sent for it to op­er­ate the con­sulate in Hous­ton, Texas.</p>
    <p>The con­sulate was given 72 hours to close, said the Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry. Hours be­fore, Hous­ton me­dia re­ported that pa­pers were be­ing burnt in the con­sulate’s com­pound in open con­tain­ers.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing vowed to re­tal­i­ate if the US did not re­scind its de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>Law­mak­ers and diplo­mats in Wash­ing­ton say that es­pi­onage was be­hind the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s clo­sure or­der.</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing the al­le­ga­tion as “ma­li­cious slan­der”, a Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman yes­ter­day said the US ac­tion amounted to a vi­o­la­tion of the pro­vi­sions of the China-US diplo­matic treaty.</p>
    <p>“This is dis­man­tling the bridge of friend­ship be­tween the Chi­nese and Amer­i­can peo­ple,” said Mr Wang Wen­bin, the spokesman.</p>
    <p>The US says it acted to shut the Chi­nese con­sulate in Hous­ton be­cause of com­mer­cial es­pi­onage and in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty theft from Amer­i­can com­pa­nies, but an­a­lysts view the move as part of ef­forts to en­sure Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s re-elec­tion in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>“I see this as an elec­toral move,” said Pro­fes­sor Steve Tsang of the SOAS China In­sti­tute in London.</p>
    <p>“But acts like this will bake into the sys­tem an ap­proach that will be costly to re­verse by a sub­se­quent ad­min­is­tra­tion, par­tic­u­larly as the other party re­sponds in an equally thought­lessly hard way.”</p>
    <p>Be­fore then, China will shut one of the US con­sulates within its bor­ders, mak­ing the al­ready fraught re­la­tion­ship even more dif­fi­cult, said Prof Tsang.</p>
    <p>The United States on Wed­nes­day or­dered the clo­sure of the Chi­nese con­sulate in Hous­ton, giv­ing Chi­nese diplo­mats 72 hours to pack up.</p>
    <p>US of­fi­cials later said the de­ci­sion was made due to a grow­ing num­ber of bi­lat­eral dis­putes af­fect­ing ties with China. “We find the US-China re­la­tion­ship to­day weighed down by a grow­ing num­ber of dis­putes,” said Deputy Sec­re­tary of State Stephen Biegun at a Sen­ate For­eign Re­la­tions Com­mit­tee hear­ing hours later.</p>
    <p>These dis­putes in­clude es­pi­onage and in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty theft, which State Depart­ment spokesman Mor­gan Orta­gus had ear­lier said in a state­ment were be­hind the clo­sure.</p>
    <p>Other dis­putes in­volve the un­equal treat­ment of Amer­i­can diplo­mats and busi­nesses by the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties, and the theft of sen­si­tive tech­nol­ogy and re­search from Amer­i­can uni­ver­si­ties to ad­vance China’s own mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>The New York Times quoted Mr David Stil­well, the top US diplo­mat for East Asia, de­scrib­ing the Hous­ton con­sulate as the “epi­cen­tre” of re­search theft by the Chi­nese mil­i­tary in the US, with­out pro­vid­ing de­tails to sup­port the claim.</p>
    <p>China has vowed to re­tal­i­ate, and ex­perts be­lieve it will act soon to close pos­si­bly the US con­sulate in Chengdu or Hong Kong. The US also has con­sulates in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenyang and Wuhan, while China has con­sulates in San Fran­cisco, Los An­ge­les, New York and Chicago, be­sides Hous­ton.</p>
    <p>Al­though there was early spec­u­la­tion that the Wuhan con­sulate would be the tar­get as it is the “sis­ter” con­sulate to the Chi­nese one in Hous­ton, Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party pa­per Global Times’ editor-in-chief Hu Xi­jin be­lieves that would amount to “let­ting the US off too eas­ily”.</p>
    <p>The vo­cal Mr Hu, whose com­ments are closely fol­lowed by China watch­ers, as­serted in a so­cial me­dia post yes­ter­day that the US is hop­ing that China will get even by shut­ting its Wuhan con­sulate, and it has been mak­ing prepa­ra­tions to with­draw the con­sulate from the city.</p>
    <p>“The US con­sulate in Wuhan is ready. It is much eas­ier for it to meet China’s or­der to shut, and the pain of the US will be dif­fer­ent from that of Chi­nese diplo­mats leav­ing Hous­ton,” he said.</p>
    <p>“If China re­tal­i­ates, it will likely jump out of the US’ ‘pre-set bat­tle­field’ and tar­get a place that will make the US feel more pain, and un­ex­pect­edly so.”</p>
    <p>Chengdu is a prob­a­ble tar­get, given that the US con­sulate there is re­spon­si­ble for mon­i­tor­ing ac­tiv­i­ties in western China, in­clud­ing sen­si­tive prov­inces like Ti­bet and Xin­jiang, said Dr Hoo Tiang Boon, who stud­ies US-China re­la­tions at the S. Ra­jarat­nam School of In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies.</p>
    <p>“The re­la­tion­ship is in a spi­ral, but it’s still within the thresh­old,” said Dr Hoo. “A lot of provoca­tive ac­tions are be­ing taken, in my view, tit-for-tat, petty bick­er­ing go­ing on be­tween the two at a po­lit­i­cal level and cer­tainly at an eco­nomic level. But so far it hasn’t de­scended into some­thing that may in­volve the use of force and that would be of a dif­fer­ent scale al­to­gether.”</p>
    <p>The US’ re­cent ac­tions against China are “some­thing I think the Chi­nese can live with, be­cause they just want to see through this pe­riod of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion and see how things pan out af­ter the (pres­i­den­tial) elec­tion”, said Dr Hoo.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion had pre­vi­ously or­dered the Rus­sian con­sulate in San Fran­cisco to close in 2017, fol­lowed by the one in Seat­tle one a year later.</p>
