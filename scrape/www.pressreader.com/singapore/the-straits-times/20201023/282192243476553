    <p>Bit­coin surged past US$13,000 for the first time since July last year after on­line pay­ments gi­ant PayPal Hold­ings an­nounced it would al­low cus­tomers to use cryp­tocur­ren­cies.</p>
    <p>The largest dig­i­tal coin in­creased US$950, or 8 per cent, dur­ing tra­di­tional trad­ing hours in New York. It climbed an­other 2 per cent to US$13,119 in early Asian trad­ing.</p>
    <p>Gains among so-called al­ter­na­tive coins were even big­ger on Wed­nes­day, with lite­coin jump­ing more than 13 per cent and bit­coin cash surg­ing more than 9 per cent.</p>
    <p>PayPal cus­tomers can buy, sell and hold cryp­tocur­ren­cies – in­clud­ing bit­coin, ether, bit­coin cash and lite­coin – from dig­i­tal wal­lets, as well as use the vir­tual money to shop at the 26 mil­lion mer­chants on its net­work. Shares of PayPal jumped 5.5 per cent to US$213.07, the big­gest in­crease since May.</p>
    <p>Mr Mike Novo­gratz, who runs Galaxy In­vest­ment Part­ners, on Twit­ter called it “the big­gest news of the year in crypto”, adding that banks will em­bark on a race to ser­vice dig­i­tal cur­ren­cies. “We have crossed the Ru­bi­con,” he said.</p>
    <p>The news sparked an ex­u­ber­ant re­sponse from cryp­tocur­rency fans, who pointed to a string of re­cent an­nounce­ments that sug­gest wider ac­cep­tance by old-school fi­nan­cial main­stays.</p>
    <p>Two pub­lic firms – Square and Mi­croS­trat­egy – said re­cently they had in­vested in bit­coin. And Fidelity In­vest­ments an­nounced in Au­gust that it is launch­ing its first bit­coin fund, adding its es­tab­lish­ment name and star power to the of­ten-ma­ligned as­set class.</p>
    <p>PayPal said it plans to make the fea­tures avail­able as a fund­ing source for pur­chases at its mer­chants world­wide, and in­tends to ex­pand it to its mo­bile pay­ments app Venmo soon. Mer­chants will be paid in tra­di­tional cur­ren­cies such as the dol­lar rather than in cryp­tocur­ren­cies when PayPal cus­tomers make pur­chases.</p>
    <p>The firm’s pres­i­dent and chief ex­ec­u­tive Dan Schul­man said in a state­ment: “The shift to dig­i­tal forms of cur­ren­cies is in­evitable, bring­ing with it clear ad­van­tages in terms of fi­nan­cial in­clu­sion and ac­cess; ef­fi­ciency, speed and re­silience of the pay­ments sys­tem; and the abil­ity of gov­ern­ments to dis­burse funds to cit­i­zens quickly.”</p>
    <p>Users do face some lim­i­ta­tions on PayPal. They can­not trans­fer coins in and out of ac­counts and can hold only cryp­tocur­ren­cies that they bought on PayPal.</p>
    <p>Any cryp­to­coins held in an ac­count can­not be trans­ferred to other ac­counts, the firm said.</p>
    <p>PayPal is step­ping into cryp­tocur­ren­cies only a year after pulling out of the Li­bra As­so­ci­a­tion, an ef­fort started by Face­book to de­velop a dig­i­tal cur­rency.</p>
    <p>Bit­coin has been on a hot streak this month, ris­ing about 19 per cent.</p>
    <p>Still, the use case for the cryp­tocur­rency re­mains lim­ited.</p>
    <p>Data from blockchain re­searcher Chainal­y­sis last year showed that hardly any­one used bit­coin for any­thing be­yond spec­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>This is due in part to its wild price swings. The coin is up about 75 per cent this year, but is still around US$7,000 away from its all-time high of about US$20,000, set in De­cem­ber 2017. In March, dur­ing a coro­n­avirus-in­duced sell-off, it fell 31 per cent.</p>
