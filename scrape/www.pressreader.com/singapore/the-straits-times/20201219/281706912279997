    <p>This was the year that the term cir­cuit breaker took on a new mean­ing for Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>It hap­pened on April 3.</p>
    <p>Be­fore that Friday, most would have as­so­ci­ated the term with the non­de­script box full of switches in their home that breaks the flow of cur­rent as a safety mea­sure when elec­tri­cal ap­pli­ances mal­func­tion.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing the na­tion that day, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said Sin­ga­pore would be ap­ply­ing a</p>
    <p>“cir­cuit breaker” to stem spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The pe­riod of en­hanced so­cial dis­tanc­ing and iso­la­tion was to last for one month from April 7 to May 4, with work­places and schools closed and most shops shut­tered.</p>
    <p>As the Covid-19 out­break wors­ened, the Govern­ment ex­tended the</p>
    <p>the cir­cuit breaker till June 1, and fur­ther tight­ened re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>And so, life in Sin­ga­pore came to a sort of stand­still, in a be­wil­der­ing pe­riod now known as “CB” for short. Fam­i­lies were kept apart with peo­ple al­lowed to in­ter­act only with those liv­ing in the same house­hold. Many grand­par­ents could not see their grand­chil­dren.</p>
    <p>This threw child­care ar­range­ments into dis­ar­ray, some­thing that many work­ing par­ents grudg­ingly ac­cepted as they had to help their chil­dren with home-based learn­ing even as they them­selves worked from home.</p>
    <p>Many turned to bak­ing at home</p>
    <p>to pass the time, with flour and other bak­ing sup­plies run­ning out in shops.</p>
    <p>Out­side, the city be­came a ghost town, with an eerie si­lence fall­ing across the is­land.</p>
    <p>With mostly just es­sen­tial work­ers need­ing to com­mute, there were fewer cars and buses ply­ing the roads. Elec­tronic Road Pric­ing was sus­pended as traffic thinned.</p>
    <p>MRT trains were al­most empty dur­ing rush hour.</p>
    <p>On side­walks and along roads, grass and trees grew wilder.</p>
    <p>With no din­ing in al­lowed at hawker cen­tres, cafes and restau­rants, and re­tail out­lets at shop­ping</p>
    <p>malls closed, peo­ple flocked to out­door places in search of plea­sure and fresh air. They were, af­ter all, lim­ited to go­ing out only for ex­er­cise, to see the doc­tor or to buy es­sen­tial sup­plies.</p>
    <p>As parks, park con­nec­tors and beaches filled up, some venues were closed to pre­vent over­crowd­ing, and peo­ple were en­cour­aged to ex­er­cise near their homes.</p>
    <p>The na­tional pas­time of shop­ping, mean­while, moved online and peo­ple bought all man­ner of goods – from gro­ceries to in­door slides for chil­dren.</p>
    <p>For many re­tail­ers, this was an un­ex­pected boon, and they strug­gled to bring in enough stocks to meet de­mand, amid sup­ply chain dis­rup­tions around the world.</p>
    <p>Barred from eating out, peo­ple bought take­away or placed de­liv­ery or­ders from their favourite restau­rants and hawker stalls.</p>
    <p>While the cir­cuit breaker proved ef­fec­tive in re­duc­ing the spread of Covid-19, it also took a toll on some. In­stances of do­mes­tic vi­o­lence and men­tal health is­sues rose dur­ing the pe­riod, a trend seen around the world.</p>
    <p>The strange pe­riod also in­spired acts of so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity and sol­i­dar­ity, and or­di­nary Sin­ga­pore­ans came to­gether to help the more vul­ner­a­ble in their com­mu­ni­ties, with some buy­ing gro­ceries for their elderly neigh­bours and oth­ers de­liv­er­ing care pack­ages of masks to needy fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>The cir­cuit breaker lasted till June 1, with Sin­ga­pore re­open­ing its econ­omy in phases.</p>
    <p>On Monday, PM Lee an­nounced that phase three will be­gin on Dec 28, with larger so­cial gath­er­ings al­lowed, among other things.</p>
    <p>Else­where, coun­tries and cities had also im­posed sim­i­lar lock­downs to curb the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>China led the way when it shut down Wuhan – where the out­break first sur­faced – and other big cities in cen­tral Hubei province in Jan­uary. Hun­dreds of mil­lions of peo­ple were put un­der strin­gent move­ment re­stric­tion, with only one per­son from each house­hold al­lowed to go out­side to shop for pro­vi­sions once every two days.</p>
    <p>In Eu­rope, coun­tries in­clud­ing Italy, France and Britain im­posed na­tional lock­downs.</p>
    <p>Across the Causeway, Malaysia im­posed a na­tion­wide move­ment con­trol or­der in mid-March, ban­ning pub­lic gath­er­ings, shut­ting schools and closing busi­nesses ex­cept for cer­tain cat­e­gories of es­sen­tial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­pore’s cir­cuit breaker was ini­tially seen as a eu­phemism for a par­tial lock­down, gov­ern­ments and sci­en­tists around the world have since used the term to describe rel­a­tively short and tar­geted lock­downs with a set date.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia and Is­rael, for in­stance, have im­ple­mented cir­cuit break­ers in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>Since then, new terms have also en­tered the lex­i­con of Covid-19 lock­downs, with Wales im­ple­ment­ing a two-week “fire­break” from Oc­to­ber to Novem­ber, and Ger­many im­ple­ment­ing a four-week “wave breaker” last month.</p>
