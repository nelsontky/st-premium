    <p>Fur­ther to the re­port on the in­quiry into Mr An­drew Ho</p>
    <p>Chee Meng’s death, I won­der if there was any find­ing of as­phyx­i­a­tion in the au­topsy</p>
    <p>(Man re­strained by pub­lic died of nat­u­ral dis­ease process: Coro­ner, Sept 23)?</p>
    <p>I ask af­ter look­ing at the pic­tures in the re­port show­ing the scene where Mr Ho was held down by mem­bers of the pub­lic on an un­even sur­face in such a man­ner that the edge of the kerb was pressed against his ab­domen just be­low his rib cage.</p>
    <p>Two of the by­standers were seen press­ing down on the lower back of Mr Ho, against the edge of the kerb, which acted like a ful­crum.</p>
    <p>If this were so, it could have put pres­sure on his stom­ach caus­ing him to vomit.</p>
    <p>Also, the ex­ter­nal pres­sure on his rib cage could have re­stricted his breath­ing.</p>
    <p>Even though the above might have oc­curred, the passers-by who re­strained the man could not pos­si­bly have knowl­edge of proper and safe meth­ods of re­strain­ing a per­son, thus should be ex­on­er­ated.</p>
    <p>There have been sev­eral re­ports of al­leged crim­i­nals be­ing chased down by mem­bers of the pub­lic, be­ing caught, and im­mo­bilised till the ar­rival of the po­lice.</p>
    <p>And this is good rea­son for the pub­lic to be taught how to safely re­strain an un­armed cul­prit and con­tin­u­ally mon­i­tor him as a means of mit­i­gat­ing risks.</p>
    <p>One such method is sim­ply to im­mo­bilise at the el­bow of the out­stretched up­per limb while the cul­prit is face down, with­out hav­ing to touch any point from the head to the torso. Dana El­liott (Dr)</p>
