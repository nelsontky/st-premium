    <p>1 Too Much And Never Enough: How My Fam­ily Cre­ated The World’s Most Dan­ger­ous Man by Mary Trump</p>
    <p>The au­thor is Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s niece, and has a PhD in clin­i­cal psy­chol­ogy. The White House re­jected the claims in the book and the Trump fam­ily sued to block the book. But a judge sided with the pub­lisher. It was re­leased on July 14.</p>
    <p>Ex­cerpts</p>
    <p>• “Don­ald, to­day, is much as he was at three years old, in­ca­pable of grow­ing, learn­ing or evolv­ing, un­able to reg­u­late his emo­tions, mod­er­ate his re­sponses and syn­the­sise in­for­ma­tion.”</p>
    <p>• “This is far be­yond gar­den-va­ri­ety nar­cis­sism. Don­ald is not sim­ply weak, his ego is a fragile thing that must be bol­stered ev­ery mo­ment be­cause he knows deep down that he is noth­ing of what he claims to be.”</p>
    <p>• “Ly­ing was pri­mar­ily a mode of self-ag­gran­dis­e­ment meant to con­vince other peo­ple he (Don­ald Trump) was bet­ter than he ac­tu­ally was.”</p>
    <p>2 The Room Where It Hap­pened by John Bolton</p>
    <p>Mr Bolton is Mr Trump’s for­mer Na­tional Se­cu­rity Ad­viser. Mr Trump has slammed the no­to­ri­ously hawk­ish Mr Bolton for be­ing a “dis­grun­tled bor­ing fool” who al­most started a war with Iran. The White House asked a fed­eral judge to block the book’s re­lease but was un­suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>Ex­cerpts</p>
    <p>• “At the open­ing din­ner of the Osaka G-20 meet­ing in June 2019, with only in­ter­preters present, Xi (China’s Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping) had ex­plained to Trump why he was ba­si­cally build­ing con­cen­tra­tion camps in Xin­jiang. Trump said that Xi should go ahead with build­ing the camps, which Trump thought was ex­actly the right thing to do. ”</p>
    <p>• “I am hard pressed to iden­tify any sig­nif­i­cant Trump de­ci­sion dur­ing my ten­ure that wasn’t driven by re-elec­tion cal­cu­la­tions.”</p>
    <p>• “Trump gen­er­ally had only two in­tel­li­gence brief­ings per week, and in most of those, he spoke at greater length than the briefers, of­ten on mat­ters com­pletely un­re­lated to the sub­jects at hand.”</p>
    <p>3 Dis­loyal: A Mem­oir by Michael Co­hen</p>
    <p>Mr Co­hen was once per­sonal at­tor­ney for Mr Trump. In Novem­ber 2018, he pleaded guilty to ly­ing to a Se­nate com­mit­tee about ef­forts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. In De­cem­ber 2018, he was fined US$50,000 (S$68,000) and sen­tenced to three years in fed­eral prison af­ter plead­ing guilty to tax eva­sion and cam­paign fi­nance vi­o­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Ex­cerpts</p>
    <p>• “As a rule, Trump ex­pressed low opin­ions of all black folks, from mu­sic to cul­ture and pol­i­tics.”</p>
    <p>• “When (for­mer Pres­i­dent Barack) Obama won the (2009) No­bel Prize, Trump went bal­lis­tic, as if the uni­verse were play­ing some kind of trick on him to drive him out of his mind... In one bizarre in­ci­dent, Trump hired an Obama looka­like and rit­u­al­is­ti­cally be­lit­tled the first black pres­i­dent and then fired him in a video.”</p>
