    <p>On the fourth floor of Novena Gar­dens, an old apart­ment block in Thom­son Road, more than 20 com­pa­nies are reg­is­tered to one unit.</p>
    <p>Most are linked to the busi­ness of aes­thet­ics medicine, with a few in gen­eral in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>But on July 20, a new en­tity was formed which, within weeks, made an au­da­cious foray into the big money, head­line-grab­bing world of English Premier League foot­ball.</p>
    <p>On Aug 15, the Bel­la­graph Nova (BN) Group an­nounced it was “at an ad­vanced stage of ne­go­ti­a­tion” for a takeover of New­cas­tle United Foot­ball Club.</p>
    <p>The 127-year-old club is owned by bil­lion­aire re­tailer Mike Ash­ley, who put New­cas­tle up for sale in 2017 but has yet to get an of­fer he likes.</p>
    <p>A £300m (S$544 mil­lion) bid by Saudi Ara­bia’s Pri­vate In­vest­ment Fund ap­peared to be a sure deal, but the of­fer was with­drawn on July 30 due to pro­tracted ne­go­ti­a­tions.</p>
    <p>In stepped the BN Group, which billed it­self as “a world’s lead­ing con­glom­er­ate” with 31 en­ti­ties in “all ma­jor busi­ness fields, from fi­nan­cial to sport, health­care and lux­ury goods, en­ter­tain­ment and robotics”.</p>
    <p>It also claimed to have US$12 bil­lion (S$16 bil­lion) in rev­enue last year and 23,000 em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>Its founders are Sin­ga­porean bankers-turned-en­trepreneur­s Nel­son Loh, 40, and Ter­ence Loh, 42, and Ms Evangeline Shen, 32, a Chi­nese lawyer and jew­ellery mer­chant.</p>
    <p>In the two weeks since their bid, the BN Group has found it­self un­der in­tense scru­tiny.</p>
    <p>The co-founders were first called out for doc­tor­ing images of them­selves with former United States pres­i­dent Barack Obama.</p>
    <p>Other in­con­sis­ten­cies in their pub­lic­ity ma­te­rial sur­faced. Checks by The Sun­day Times un­cov­ered a pat­tern of out­landish and ques­tion­able claims in the in­ter­views, press re­leases and so­cial me­dia ac­counts of the founders. These range from ex­ag­ger­a­tions to mis­in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The group has ei­ther re­tracted or deleted press re­leases that were on­line, as well as In­sta­gram ac­counts.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, in­di­vid­u­als and or­gan­i­sa­tions have dis­tanced them­selves or de­nied any ties with the group. A Sin­ga­pore-listed stock linked to them has had to halt trad­ing.</p>
    <p>At the heart of the saga are two ques­tions: Why did the trio make the New­cas­tle bid? And how did their own pub­lic­ity ma­te­rial prove to be their un­do­ing?</p>
    <p>Mr James Walton, sports busi­ness group leader at Deloitte Sin­ga­pore and South-east Asia, pointed out that very few foot­ball club own­ers are ac­tu­ally mak­ing a profit.</p>
    <p>To want to own a club, it has to be ei­ther a pas­sion project – or you have to have an­other rea­son.</p>
    <p>He said there has not been any­thing in the trio’s his­tory to sug­gest any con­nec­tions to New­cas­tle, so a con­clu­sion could be the bid was a move to ben­e­fit their over­all busi­ness port­fo­lio.</p>
    <p>“They could use New­cas­tle’s pro­file and the Premier League global au­di­ence to mar­ket their port­fo­lio of brands un­der the BN Group,” he sug­gested.</p>
    <p>“Things like stock prices and the over­all brand­ing of their port­fo­lio do come into play and con­sid­er­a­tion, more so than for in­di­vid­ual bid­ders.”</p>
    <p>As for why New­cas­tle, Mr Walton said the club has a large and loyal fan base, and a large sta­dium.</p>
    <p>“They are a high-pro­file team, with all the in­gre­di­ents for suc­cess but also where the fans have grown ac­cus­tomed to not win­ning tro­phies, so there is no im­me­di­ate de­mand or ex­pec­ta­tions to win im­me­di­ately, but rather just to be in the European places and sta­ble.”</p>
    <p>For an in­vestor who can­not af­ford one of the big six Premier League teams – which would cost at least £1 bil­lion – the next best clubs avail­able at a sig­nif­i­cantly lower price of £200 mil­lion to £400 mil­lion are New­cas­tle, West Ham and Ever­ton, he said.</p>
    <p>The BN Group’s re­ported £280 mil­lion bid is rea­son­able, he added.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic­ity of the bid</p>
    <p>If the bid was to garner pub­lic­ity for the BN Group – and maybe its Catal­ist-listed Ax­ing­ton stock – it has back­fired spec­tac­u­larly.</p>
    <p>It is un­clear, though, if the bid was meant to be pub­lic, or if the pub­lic­ity had gone ac­cord­ing to plan.</p>
    <p>The story of the bid was bro­ken by Bri­tish sports jour­nal­ist Liam Kennedy in the Shields Gazette, a pa­per in north-east Eng­land that is big on New­cas­tle news.</p>
    <p>Mr Kennedy’s exclusive, based on sources, was timed to ap­pear on the morn­ing of Aug 15 in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>It was head­lined “Exclusive: Far East in­vestors Ter­ence and Nel­son Loh hold talks over New­cas­tle United takeover bid”.</p>
    <p>A se­condary head­line said “Mike Ash­ley STILL hopes to push through a deal with the Saudi con­sor­tium”.</p>
    <p>The re­port had de­tails of the Lohs and said they were us­ing their Dorr pri­vate equity ve­hi­cle in the bid. There was no men­tion of the BN Group.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the re­port came out, the Shields Gazette got an e-mail from the group claim­ing the story was “fake news”. An­other re­port was later pub­lished men­tion­ing the BN Group.</p>
    <p>A few hours af­ter Mr Kennedy’s scoop, more than 200 jour­nal­ists around the world – in­clud­ing in Sin­ga­pore – re­ceived an e-mail signed by Mr Nerei­des An­to­nio Gi­a­mundo de Bour­bon, the chief mar­ket­ing and in­vestor re­la­tions of­fi­cer “for and on be­half of the Bel­la­graph Nova Group”.</p>
    <p>Pre­sum­ably re­fer­ring to Mr Kennedy’s story – and per­haps how the Saudis were the pre­ferred choice – the cover note struck an an­gry tone about “some fake state­ments” and urged the re­cip­i­ents to “spread the cor­rect news”.</p>
    <p>Mr de Bour­bon at­tached a statement on the bid, the group’s of­fer of pro­posal, an 18-slide pre­sen­ta­tion deck on the BN Group list­ing all its en­ti­ties, board of di­rec­tors and its cor­po­rate be­liefs, a photo of former New­cas­tle player Michael Cho­pra at its Paris of­fice – and a (pho­to­shopped) pic­ture of the founders with Mr Obama.</p>
    <p>That e-mail was to prove to be the group’s un­do­ing. As it has since emerged, quite a few claims could not be ver­i­fied.</p>
    <p>Mr Kennedy told The Sun­day Times: “From the very start, there has been scep­ti­cism about the BNG bid, and even though I broke the story, I have al­ways had my doubts.</p>
    <p>“There is a real air of un­pro­fes­sion­al­ism about the way they’ve gone about things, even go­ing as far as to send out a statement with the con­tact de­tails of each one of the in­vestors de­tailed in it. This is so far re­moved from usual prac­tice.”</p>
    <p>Bri­tish foot­ball jour­nal­ist Miles Star­forth, who wrote the se­cond re­port for Shields Gazette, has seen a lot of would-be bid­ders for New­cas­tle come and go.</p>
    <p>“I tend to treat all new ex­pres­sions of in­ter­est and bids with a de­gree of scep­ti­cism, es­pe­cially if they are leaked so early in the process,” he said.</p>
    <p>Who are the Loh cousins?</p>
    <p>The Lohs are not par­tic­u­larly known in Sin­ga­pore’s cor­po­rate cir­cles. Over the past decade, though, a fair num­ber of ar­ti­cles have been writ­ten about them, mostly in so­ci­ety mag­a­zines and al­most all in a glow­ing, un­ques­tion­ing tone.</p>
    <p>Af­ter an early start in in­vest­ment bank­ing, they moved into pri­vate equity, and then the health and well­ness in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>A pro­fes­sional peer said the two men are “very so­cia­ble, en­joyed the night life and were a bit flashy. They know how to put on a show, and like to drop names”.</p>
    <p>The Lohs are said to come from a wealthy back­ground and grew up in Bukit Timah.</p>
    <p>They are neph­ews of Mr Luo Hao­cai, a se­nior Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party leader who had been vicechair of the Chi­nese Peo­ple’s Po­lit­i­cal Con­sul­ta­tive Con­fer­ence, a top po­lit­i­cal ad­vi­sory group.</p>
    <p>Mr Luo – who was born in Sin­ga­pore, took part in the anti-colo­nial move­ment and was de­ported to China by the Bri­tish in 1952 – died in 2018.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with Lianhe Zaobao af­ter his death, the Lohs, who spoke about their un­cle and their busi­ness in China, said they liked to keep their Chi­nese con­nec­tion dis­creet.</p>
    <p>But one ex­cep­tion re­counted by Mr Ter­ence Loh dur­ing the in­ter­view was when he broke a fin­ger in Shang­hai and was rushed to the hos­pi­tal in the wee hours. The hos­pi­tal staff were in­dif­fer­ent and did not give him ur­gent med­i­cal help, so he phoned his un­cle in Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Within 45 min­utes, the head of the hos­pi­tal rushed down and ar­ranged for an op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“That was an extraordin­ary mo­ment, I would only use my con­nec­tions at such a crit­i­cal time,” Mr Ter­ence Loh told Zaobao.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to an on­line ar­ti­cle, Mr Nel­son Loh spon­sors a Luo Hao­cai Cam­bridge Schol­ar­ship.</p>
    <p>Cam­bridge is his alma mater and a peer was sur­prised to hear of the cur­rent de­vel­op­ments.</p>
    <p>“He was al­ways a de­cent, nice guy with no airs, de­spite his back­ground. No­body had bad things to say about him. He was also good­look­ing so the girls quite liked him,” the univer­sity mate said.</p>
    <p>Mr Ter­ence Loh grad­u­ated from Santa Clara Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>It does ap­pear that the Lohs have a gen­uine in­ter­est in sports. The Sin­ga­pore Muay Thai Fed­er­a­tion, Xin Hua Novu Blaze bas­ket­ball club, race car driver Yuey Tan and the St Michael’s Soc­cer As­so­ci­a­tion (SMSA) have all ac­knowl­edged spon­sor­ship from the cousins through their Novu Aes­thet­ics clinic, amount­ing up to tens of thou­sands of dol­lars.</p>
    <p>SMSA pres­i­dent Kieren Pereira said of Ter­ence: “From my ex­pe­ri­ence, he is a gen­uine per­son who sin­cerely wants to do his part in con­tribut­ing to the chil­dren.”</p>
    <p>Who is Evangeline Shen?</p>
    <p>While some of Ms Shen’s claims in press re­leases have been ques­tion­able, her ed­u­ca­tional back­ground and le­gal qual­i­fi­ca­tions have checked out.</p>
    <p>She studied law at Fu­dan Univer­sity and did her mas­ter’s at Ren­min Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>In re­cent press re­leases is­sued on her be­half, in­clud­ing one ti­tled “In­tro­duc­ing Evangeline Shen – Re­defin­ing the Fe­male Cor­po­rate Trail­blazer”, there has been much men­tion of her ca­reer but lit­tle of her family life.</p>
    <p>But in a 2017 in­ter­view with Chi­nese fash­ion site Shis­hang Bao­dao, she was de­scribed as com­ing from an in­flu­en­tial family and that her hus­band’s family had been in the gem­stone busi­ness for a long time.</p>
    <p>Be­sides Mor­gan Stan­ley, she has worked for UBS as an in­vest­ment banker, as well as served as vi­cepres­i­dent in a Shang­hai buy­out fund and ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor for CBridge Cap­i­tal. Shang­hai Bar As­so­ci­a­tion records also show she has worked for Dong Lian and Jones Day law firms.</p>
    <p>De­spite hav­ing had prom­i­nent em­ploy­ers in the bank­ing and le­gal world, it seems it is her ca­reer as a jew­ellery mer­chant that she is most proud of.</p>
    <p>In many of the mar­ket­ing ma­te­ri­als put out, she touts Bel­la­graph Jew­elry as one of the “most well­known sub­sidiaries” of the BN Group she is said to have founded.</p>
    <p>An ac­quain­tance said the Chi­nese na­tional of­ten speaks about her jew­ellery busi­ness and has claimed to be a sup­plier to other big jew­ellery brands.</p>
    <p>But while Bel­la­graph Jew­elry’s web­site says it has show­rooms in Van­cou­ver, Shang­hai, Hong Kong, Paris and Sin­ga­pore, nei­ther jewellers and gemol­o­gists here who spoke to The Sun­day Times, nor those in Europe and the US, know of the com­pany.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Au­thor­ity (Acra) records, Ms Shen set up jew­ellery com­pany Bel­la­graph SG in June last year. Its reg­is­tered ad­dress is at Hana con­do­minium in Tom­lin­son Road.</p>
    <p>A search of Chi­nese busi­ness records shows that Ms Shen, also known as Shen Che, has three com­pa­nies reg­is­tered un­der her name.</p>
    <p>Two – Xu­jiangjun Med­i­cal Tech­nol­ogy and Ze An En­ter­prise Con­sult­ing – have Shang­hai ad­dresses while a third, Shen­zhen Bel­la­graph, is reg­is­tered in the tech­no­log­i­cal hub.</p>
    <p>Both Xu­jiangjun and Ze An, which runs a le­gal ad­vice web­site and bot, are in in­dus­trial parks.</p>
    <p>The Bel­la­graph brand does have at least one out­let in Shang­hai – a jew­ellery bou­tique in the base­ment of Shang­hai’s Penin­sula Ho­tel along the iconic Shang­hai Bund.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing two vis­its last week, the shop was closed with cur­tains drawn and jew­ellery kept away from dis­play cab­i­nets.</p>
    <p>Above an empty dis­play case hung a pic­ture of Ms Shen and Mr Obama.</p>
    <p>The BN group</p>
    <p>The BN Group was formed last month fol­low­ing a merger of the Loh cousins’ Dorr Group and Ms Shen’s Bel­la­graph Group, with a paid-up cap­i­tal of $20 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Dorr Group is the in­vest­ment ve­hi­cle of the Lohs and pre­vi­ously re­ported to be man­ag­ing over $5 bil­lion in as­sets.</p>
    <p>The Sun­day Times could not find any busi­ness record of Dorr Group in Sin­ga­pore, which is said to have been set up in 2008. But a search showed Dorr Global Health­care In­ter­na­tional reg­is­tered in 2016.</p>
    <p>There is no busi­ness record of Bel­la­graph Group here or in China, but there is a Bel­la­graph SG that was reg­is­tered in June last year.</p>
    <p>Of the 31 en­ti­ties listed un­der the BN Group, five were found to be reg­is­tered with Acra.</p>
    <p>Even though the rest were not reg­is­tered with Acra, the names were sim­i­lar to some 27 busi­nesses reg­is­tered un­der Mr Nel­son Loh.</p>
    <p>Novena Global Life­care Group, which is part of the Dorr Group, was founded in 2010. The Lohs have talked about growing Novena Global Life­care to be one of Asia’s largest in­te­grated med­i­cal health­care and aes­thetic groups with over 250 cen­tres glob­ally.</p>
    <p>Most of the med­i­cal pro­fes­sion­als The Sun­day Times spoke to said</p>
