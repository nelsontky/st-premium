    <p>VENICE • The world has had spaghetti Westerns – and now it must brace it­self f or a paella West­ern.</p>
    <p>Leg­endary Span­ish direc­tor Pe­dro Almod­ovar said on Thurs­day that he is work­ing on a West­ern, in a sur­pris­ing ca­reer turn for the mas­ter of fe­male-friendly melo­drama, who made his name with Women On The Verge Of A</p>
    <p>Ner­vous Break­down (1988).</p>
    <p>The Os­car win­ner told re­porters at the Venice film fes­ti­val that he has writ­ten the cow­boy flick, but that it was “a dif­fer­ent kind of West­ern, which will be very colour­ful... very the­atri­cal”.</p>
    <p>Spaghetti Westerns made by Ital­ian di­rec­tors such as the late Ser­gio Leone be­came a phe­nom­e­non in the 1960s, with many shot in</p>
    <p>Spain’s dry south-east­ern Alme­ria re­gion.</p>
    <p>Almod­ovar pre­miered his lat­est film, The Hu­man Voice, at Venice on Thurs­day, with Bri­tish ac­tress Tilda Swin­ton in the lead as a des­per­ate, venge­ful woman wait­ing for her es­tranged lover to call her.</p>
    <p>Filmed last month, the 30-minute film is Almod­ovar’s first to be shot in English and is loosely adapted from French play­wright Jean Cocteau’s clas­sic play of the same name.</p>
    <p>The direc­tor, 70, ad­mit­ted that the play and its theme of the jilted lover wait­ing on a “call that will never come” was close to his heart.</p>
    <p>“It hap­pened to me,” he told a press con­fer­ence, adding that char­ac­ters hang­ing on a tele­phone call was a thread that ran through much of his work.</p>
    <p>Almod­ovar, once fa­mous for his vis­ual and emo­tional flam­boy­ance, also claimed he has started mov­ing in a more aus­tere direc­tion since his 2016 film Juli­eta. “I am work­ing to­wards a leaner nar­ra­tive with fewer el­e­ments, which I an­a­lyse very deeply,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The ex­pe­ri­ence of so­bri­ety and aus­ter­ity ac­com­pa­nied me also in Pain And Glory,” he added, re­fer­ring to the largely au­to­bi­o­graph­i­cal film last year, in which Span­ish ac­tor An­to­nio Ban­deras played a film direc­tor suf­fer­ing from chronic back pain, as Almod­ovar does.</p>
    <p>The direc­tor said he hopes to start his next fea­ture, Madres Par­ale­las, next month, be­fore mak­ing the West­ern and an­other film called A Man­ual For Clean­ing Women.</p>
