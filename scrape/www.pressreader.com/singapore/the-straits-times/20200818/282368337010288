    <p>LON­DON • World No. 2 Si­mona Halep will not travel to New York to play in the US Open due to Covid-19 con­cerns, leav­ing the women’s draw at the hard-court Grand Slam with­out six of the world’s top-10 play­ers.</p>
    <p>The Ro­ma­nian yes­ter­day con­firmed her with­drawal, join­ing top-ranked Ash­leigh Barty, de­fend­ing cham­pion Bianca An­dreescu (No. 6), Elina Svi­tolina (No. 5), Kiki Bertens (No. 7) and Belinda Bencic (No. 8) in skip­ping the Aug 31-Sept 13 event.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter weigh­ing up all the fac­tors in­volved and with the ex­cep­tional cir­cum­stances in which we are liv­ing, I have de­cided that I will not travel to New York to play the US Open,” the reign­ing Wim­ble­don win­ner tweeted.</p>
    <p>“I al­ways said I would put my health at the heart of my de­ci­sion and I there­fore pre­fer to stay and train in Europe.</p>
    <p>“I know the United States Ten­nis As­so­ci­a­tion and WTA Tour have worked tire­lessly to put on a safe event and I wish ev­ery­one there a suc­cess­ful tour­na­ment.”</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old won the Prague Open on Sun­day – her first event since the pan­demic – but has opted to fo­cus on the clay-court swing ahead of the French Open, where she will be one of the favourites, hav­ing made the fi­nal at Roland Gar­ros twice in the past three years, win­ning in 2018.</p>
    <p>The US Open will be held be­hind closed doors and her ab­sence is an­other blow to or­gan­is­ers fol­low­ing a spate of with­drawals.</p>
    <p>On the men’s side, world No. 2 and de­fend­ing cham­pion Rafael Nadal will give the Ma­jor a miss, while five-time win­ner Roger Fed­erer is tak­ing the rest of the year off to re­cover from knee surgery. Other notable ab­sen­tees in­clude Nick Kyr­gios, Stan Wawrinka, Gael Mon­fils and Fabio Fognini.</p>
    <p>Kei Nishikori could j oin the grow­ing list af­ter the Ja­panese revealed he had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19. The former world No. 4, the 2014 run­ner-up who has twice made the semi-fi­nals in the last four edi­tions, said on Sun­day he was pulling out of this week’s West­ern & South­ern Open, the fi­nal warm-up tour­na­ment for the US Open, and would be in self-iso­la­tion.</p>
