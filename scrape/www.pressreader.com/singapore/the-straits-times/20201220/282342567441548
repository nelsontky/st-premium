    <p>When the go­ing gets tough, the tough bake bread.</p>
    <p>Yeast and bread flour – in truth, all kinds of flour – van­ished from su­per­mar­ket shelves faster than they could be re­plen­ished when the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod was an­nounced.</p>
    <p>To keep a sour­dough starter go­ing, it needs to be fed flour – and lots of it. To make bread, you need bread or plain flour.</p>
    <p>With time on their hands, Sin­ga­pore­ans kneaded their anx­i­ety away. Long queues formed at bak­ing sup­plies chain Phoon Huat. Tem­pers flared. Cus­tomers shouted at staff and at one an­other.</p>
    <p>In su­per­mar­kets, bak­ing sup­plies were scarce. There was no in­stant yeast to be found; no bread, plain or even self-rais­ing flour.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Phoon Huat and flour miller Prima were scram­bling to get their stocks out there. They had sup­plies, but pack­ag­ing for re­tail-friendly quan­ti­ties was hard to find. Even­tu­ally, they pow­ered through, work­ing round the clock.</p>
    <p>Prima in­vested in a new pack­ag­ing ma­chine. Phoon Huat was sell­ing in­stant yeast in 500g tubs. Sheng Siong of­fered plain flour in 3kg bags. Even Mai­son Kayser, pur­veyor of bread and pas­tries, started sell­ing dif­fer­ent kinds of flour.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­thing was snapped up, even those 500g tubs of yeast. Friends would send text mes­sages about yeast and flour sight­ings in this store or that.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, peo­ple can now buy sour­dough and other kinds of bread from the grow­ing num­ber of home-based food busi­nesses that have sprung up in the wake of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of the bak­ing frenzy set alight by the pan­demic, many of us can now make our own daily bread.</p>
