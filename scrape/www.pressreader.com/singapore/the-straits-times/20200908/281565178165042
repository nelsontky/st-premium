    <p>In­dia re­ported over 90,000 new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, bring­ing the to­tal to 4.2 mil­lion, the sec­ond-high­est tally of in­fec­tions af­ter the United States. Mean­while, the US saw cases rise in 22 of its 50 states ahead of the hol­i­day week­end, while Bri­tain and France shared re­newed con­cern over a fresh wave as in­fec­tions ac­cel­er­ated.</p>
    <p>CHICAGO • Coro­n­avirus cases were ris­ing in 22 of the 50 US states, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters anal­y­sis, a wor­ri­some trend on a Labour Day hol­i­day week­end tra­di­tion­ally filled with fam­ily gath­er­ings and par­ties to mark the end of sum­mer.</p>
    <p>Just three weeks ago, cases were in­creas­ing i n only three states, Hawaii, Illi­nois and South Dakota, ac­cord­ing to an anal­y­sis com­par­ing cases for the two-week pe­riod of Aug 8-22 with the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>Most of the 22 states where cases are now ris­ing are in the less-pop­u­lated parts of the Mid­west and South. On a per­cent­age ba­sis, South Dakota had the big­gest rise over the past two weeks at 126 per cent, re­port­ing over 3,700 new cases.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials have linked some of the rise to hun­dreds of thou­sands of mo­tor­cy­clists who de­scended on Stur­gis, South Dakota, for an an­nual rally in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Cases are also ris­ing rapidly in Iowa, with 13,600 new in­fec­tions in the past two weeks, and North Dakota, with 3,600 new cases in the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The in­creases are masked na­tion­wide by de­creas­ing new in­fec­tions in the most pop­u­lous states of Cal­i­for­nia, Florida and Texas.</p>
    <p>In Cal­i­for­nia, cases fell by 39,000 over the past two weeks com­pared with the prior two weeks, com­pared to a 37,000-case in­crease in the 22 states in the same pe­riod, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters anal­y­sis of state and county data.</p>
    <p>While cases na­tion­ally have dropped from a peak in July, the United States went into the Labour Day hol­i­day week­end with an av­er­age of 44,000 new cases a day – dou­ble the num­ber ahead of the May 23-25 Me­mo­rial Day week­end.</p>
    <p>Many health ex­perts partly blame the July spike on so­cial gath­er­ings held around Me­mo­rial Day.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the US con­tin­ues to av­er­age about 1,000 new deaths from Covid-19 each day, with the to­tal num­ber of lives lost ap­proach­ing 190,000 – the high­est death toll in the world.</p>
    <p>Also con­tribut­ing to the spike in cases is the re­open­ing of schools and col­leges in many ar­eas and the big gath­er­ings tak­ing place de­spite the warn­ings of health ex­perts, rang­ing from protests against racial in­jus­tice to ral­lies in sup­port of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment’s top in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­pert, Dr An­thony Fauci, has said that it is cru­cial that the out­break be con­tained be­fore the cold weather sets in, when in­fluenza cases are likely to spike along­side Covid-19 and more peo­ple be­gin to move in­doors, in­creas­ing the risk of con­ta­gion.</p>
