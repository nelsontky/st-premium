    <p>LON­DON Ever­ton man­ager Carlo Ancelotti praised his side for their fight­ing spirit in their 1-1 Premier League draw at Burn­ley yes­ter­day, af­ter Do­minic Calvert-Lewin can­celled out Rob­bie Brady’s early opener.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to Sky Sports af­ter the game, the Ital­ian ad­mit­ted a point apiece was prob­a­bly a fair re­sult for the two sides who both had chances to win at Turf Moor.</p>
    <p>“We have to ac­cept the per­for­mance and the re­sult. We suf­fered men­tally but we were in the game and un­til the end we played a good game,” the 61-year-old said.</p>
    <p>“I think we played quite good, of course we want to win but I think the point is ac­cept­able.”</p>
    <p>Burn­ley grabbed the lead in the third minute when Ever­ton mid­fielder Al­lan gave the ball away and Ashley West­wood fed Brady who drilled the ball into the bot­tom corner from the edge of the box.</p>
    <p>Ever­ton had the alert­ness of Jor­dan Pick­ford to thank in the 41st minute when Dwight McNeil slipped Chris Wood through but the goal­keeper was out quickly to foil the Burn­ley striker.</p>
    <p>Calvert-Lewin then brought Ever­ton level on the stroke of half­time, slid­ing in to meet a cross from the left by Richarli­son for his 11th league goal of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Sky Sports, the 23-year-old Eng­land striker has scored more league goals from in­side the box (11) than any other player in Europe’s top five di­vi­sions this cam­paign.</p>
    <p>“It was a dif­fi­cult game for him but at the right time he was ready. The per­for­mance was dif­fi­cult for him but he was good and Richarli­son did a good per­for­mance,” added Ancelotti.</p>
    <p>Pick­ford de­nied Wood again in the 84th, div­ing to palm away a firm header from a corner, and then Burn­ley goal­keeper Nick Pope kept Gylfi Sig­urds­son’s ef­fort out with an ex­cel­lent save with his feet.</p>
    <p>McNeil failed to make the most of a late chance for Burn­ley, who re­main in the bot­tom three with six points from 10 games.</p>
    <p>“We started the game brightly with good en­ergy. Ever­ton have a top man­ager and have put a lot of in­vest­ment into the team,” said Burn­ley man­ager Sean Dyche, who was in charge of his 200th Premier League game yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“I thought both (goal­keep­ers) made key saves to­day. There was a good feel about us to­day, we are giv­ing a lot to the cause and go­ing right to the end.</p>
    <p>“It’s tougher and tougher for English man­agers in the Premier League so I am happy with 200 games. I’ll have a small glass of wine later.”</p>
    <p>Ever­ton were the sur­prise early sea­son pace­set­ters in the English top flight but have lost their way in re­cent weeks, with four de­feats in their last six league games be­fore yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>They have also now con­ceded in 10 con­sec­u­tive league games – their long­est run with­out a clean sheet in the com­pe­ti­tion since Novem­ber 2017 (12 games).</p>
    <p>“We’ve not had a clean sheet since the first game of the sea­son and we were gut­ted to con­cede so early. We had chances to win it but it wasn’t our day,” de­fender Michael Keane said.</p>
    <p>The Tof­fees have 17 points from 11 matches, four points off lead­ers Tot­ten­ham, who host north Lon­don ri­vals Arse­nal to­day.</p>
