    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump sparked fresh con­tro­versy as he was dis­charged from hos­pi­tal on Mon­day evening af­ter be­ing treated for Covid-19, telling Amer­i­cans not to fear the coro­n­avirus that has so far in­fected over 7.5 mil­lion in the coun­try and left more than 200,000 dead.</p>
    <p>“Don’t be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dom­i­nate your life,” he tweeted from hos­pi­tal be­fore his re­lease. “We have de­vel­oped, un­der the Trump Ad­min­is­tra­tion, some re­ally great drugs & knowl­edge. I feel bet­ter than I did 20 years ago.”</p>
    <p>Upon re­turn­ing to the White House, Mr Trump re­moved his mask on the build­ing’s bal­cony as pho­to­graphs were taken, alarm­ing those who noted that a wi­den­ing cir­cle of White House staff, top aides and Repub­li­can law­mak­ers had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 in re­cent days.</p>
    <p>As he left the Wal­ter Reed Na­tional Mil­i­tary Med­i­cal Cen­tre out­side Washington, the Pres­i­dent de­clined to an­swer ques­tions shouted out by the me­dia, in­clud­ing how many White House em­ploy­ees were ill and whether he was a su­per spreader.</p>
    <p>Seek­ing a sec­ond term in of­fice, Mr Trump is keen to project an im­age of business as usual and re­turn to cam­paign­ing, with less than a month to the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>He has been trail­ing his Demo­cratic ri­val Joe Bi­den in the polls with a gap that widened af­ter the pres­i­den­tial de­bate and his Covid-19 di­ag­no­sis last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“Will be back on the Cam­paign Trail soon!!! The Fake News only shows the Fake Polls,” he tweeted on Mon­day evening.</p>
    <p>In a later tweet yes­ter­day morn­ing, he said: “I am look­ing for­ward to the de­bate on the evening of Thurs­day, Oc­to­ber 15th in Mi­ami. It will be great!” The sec­ond pres­i­den­tial de­bate in Mi­ami had been thrown into un­cer­tainty af­ter Mr Trump fell ill.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent’s physi­cian, Dr Sean Con­ley, while speak­ing to the me­dia ear­lier, nei­ther green­lit Mr Trump’s travel plans nor coun­selled against it.</p>
    <p>“As far as travel goes, we’ll see,” said Dr Con­ley at a press con­fer­ence on Mon­day af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump dou­bled down on down­play­ing Covid-19 yes­ter­day morn­ing, liken­ing it to the flu.</p>
    <p>He said on Twit­ter: “Many peo­ple ev­ery year, some­times over 100,000, and de­spite the Vac­cine, die from the Flu. Are we go­ing to close down our Coun­try? No, we have learned to live with it, just like we are learning to live with Covid, in most pop­u­la­tions far less lethal!!!” This was later hid­den and marked as mis­lead­ing by Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists, ethi­cists and doc­tors were out­raged by the Pres­i­dent’s com­ments about a dis­ease that has killed nearly 210,000 peo­ple in the United States.</p>
    <p>Weigh­ing in, Mr Bi­den said: “Tell that to the 205,000 fam­i­lies who lost some­body.”</p>
    <p>Poll­ster Nate Silver, who founded the elec­tion mod­el­ling web­site FiveThir­tyEight, said on Twit­ter that Mr Trump’s tweet was not likely to be well re­ceived.</p>
    <p>“Trump’s ‘it’s just the flu!’ mes­sag­ing on Covid is likely to be quite un­pop­u­lar, but it will be even more so if he’s also still demon­stra­bly suf­fer­ing from per­sonal health prob­lems caused by Covid,” Mr Silver wrote on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers also noted that Mr Trump, as Pres­i­dent, had ac­cess to a level of care that most Amer­i­cans did not have and likely could not af­ford.</p>
    <p>Dr Natalie Azar, as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor of rheuma­tol­ogy at the NYU Lan­gone Med­i­cal Cen­tre, wrote on Twit­ter that the av­er­age Amer­i­can who gets Covid-19 would not be med­i­cally evac­u­ated to the hos­pi­tal, nor re­ceive the Re­gen­eron an­ti­body cock­tail the Pres­i­dent re­ceived within 24 hours – if at all.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump was pro­vided the ex­per­i­men­tal drug in re­sponse to a “com­pas­sion­ate use” re­quest from his doc­tors, but it is not read­ily avail­able to most Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>It was de­vel­oped us­ing blood sam­ples from three pa­tients in Sin­ga­pore, ac­cord­ing to a report by the Asian Scientist mag­a­zine.</p>
    <p>Wrote Dr Azar: “Nor will they be dis­charged to their home which has been con­verted to a mini hos­pi­tal.”</p>
    <p>She added: “So to any­one who in­ter­prets the Pres­i­dent’s ex­pe­ri­ence with Covid-19 as the norm, please know that this is not how it plays out for most. Es­pe­cially for peo­ple of colour, es­pe­cially for peo­ple liv­ing in ru­ral ar­eas with poor ac­cess to spe­cialised care.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s doc­tors have said that he would re­turn to a White House med­i­cal unit staffed around the clock with “top-notch physi­cians, nurses, physi­cian as­sis­tants, lo­gis­ti­cians”.</p>
    <p>They also said that he had “met or ex­ceeded all dis­charge cri­te­ria” and that it had been more than 72 hours since his last fever.</p>
    <p>“Though he might not be en­tirely out of the woods yet, the team and I</p>

    <p>Don’t be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dom­i­nate your life. U.S. PRES­I­DENT DON­ALD TRUMP, on Twit­ter. HE LACKS EM­PA­THY</p>
    <p>He can check him­self in and has a team of 14 doc­tors; most of us couldn’t find one doc­tor to lis­ten to us. You’d think with him con­tract­ing it, he’d gain a lit­tle em­pa­thy.</p>

    <p>I saw a tweet he did... he said, ‘don’t let Covid con­trol your life’. Tell that to the 205,000 fam­i­lies that lost some­one.</p>
    <p>DEMO­CRATIC RI­VAL JOE BI­DEN, in an in­ter­view with WPLG, the Mi­ami ABC af­fil­i­ate.</p>
    <p>agree that all our eval­u­a­tions and, most im­por­tantly, his clin­i­cal sta­tus sup­port the Pres­i­dent’s safe re­turn home, where he’ll be sur­rounded by world-class med­i­cal care,” said Dr Con­ley.</p>
    <p>“We’re in a bit of un­charted ter­ri­tory when it comes to a pa­tient who re­ceived the ther­a­pies he has so early in the course,” he added.</p>
    <p>“So we’re look­ing to this week­end. If we can get through to Mon­day with him re­main­ing the same or im­prov­ing, bet­ter yet, then we will all take that fi­nal deep sigh of re­lief.”</p>
