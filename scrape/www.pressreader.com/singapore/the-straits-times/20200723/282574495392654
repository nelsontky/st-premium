    <p>LON­DON • John Cleese (left) does not have much time for po­lit­i­cal cor­rect­ness or can­cel cul­ture, and as for the state of the world? It is com­pletely hope­less, the former Monty Python star says.</p>
    <p>In­stead Cleese, 80, is promis­ing “a short se­lec­tion of Peru­vian burial dit­ties” when he presents a comedic live stream plus Q&A ses­sion from Lon­don next month.</p>
    <p>Why There Is No Hope is de­scribed as a part-lec­ture and part-com­edy stand-up live stream. Cleese says it is an ex­per­i­ment in front of the small au­di­ence re­quired by so­cial dis­tanc­ing in the coro­n­avirus era.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish ac­tor is per­haps best known as rude ho­tel owner Basil Fawlty in the 1970s Bri­tish TV se­ries Fawlty Tow­ers, and the man from The Min­istry Of Silly Walks in the ab­sur­dist sketch se­ries Monty Python’s Fly­ing Cir­cus in the 1970s.</p>
    <p>Cleese last month called the BBC “cowardly and gut­less” for tem­po­rar­ily tak­ing down an episode of Fawlty Tow­ers that made fun of Ger­mans and World War II and also fea­tured a char­ac­ter us­ing a ra­cial slur.</p>
    <p>Can­cel cul­ture “mis­un­der­stands the main pur­poses of life, which is to have fun”, he told Reuters, re­fer­ring to the trend in which peo­ple are os­tracised be­cause of be­hav­iour or re­marks seen as ob­jec­tion­able.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­thing hu­mor­ous is crit­i­cal. If you have some­one who is per­fectly kind and in­tel­li­gent and flex­i­ble and who al­ways be­haves ap­pro­pri­ately, they’re not funny. Fun­ni­ness is about peo­ple who don’t do that, like Trump,” he said, re­fer­ring to United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem with po­lit­i­cal cor­rect­ness, he added, is that co­me­di­ans “have to set the bar ac­cord­ing to what we are told by the most touchy, most emo­tion­ally un­sta­ble and frag­ile and least stoic peo­ple in the coun­try”.</p>
    <p>As for the Aug 2 live stream to be held at Lon­don’s Cado­gan Hall, Cleese says he ex­pects to per­form for about 50 peo­ple seated at a so­cial dis­tance.</p>
    <p>He says he is not both­ered by play­ing in front of such a small crowd.</p>
    <p>“I played to an au­di­ence once in New Zealand where I did not get a laugh,” he said.</p>
