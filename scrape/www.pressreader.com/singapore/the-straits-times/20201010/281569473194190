    <p>Re­turns on sov­er­eign bonds have dropped to his­tor­i­cal lows glob­ally as cen­tral banks cut bench­mark in­ter­est rates amid the re­ces­sion. This has sparked a hunt for higher yields, push­ing in­vestors away from gov­ern­ment-is­sued pa­per into higher-yield­ing cor­po­rate bonds and other al­ter­na­tive in­vest­ments like com­modi­ties.</p>
    <p>BAL­ANCE AND DI­VER­SI­FI­CA­TION</p>
    <p>Re­turns on sov­er­eign bonds have dropped to his­tor­i­cal lows world­wide as cen­tral banks cut bench­mark in­ter­est rates to help their economies re­cover from the coro­n­avirus-driven re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>The low yields – which mean higher bond prices – are good for com­pa­nies and gov­ern­ments strug­gling to keep their heads above wa­ter as they can raise much-needed funds cheaply.</p>
    <p>Given the depth of the down­turn, cen­tral banks in­tend to keep rates lower for much longer.</p>
    <p>But low fixed in­come re­turns have sparked a hunt for higher yields, push­ing in­vestors and savers away from gov­ern­ment-is­sued pa­per into higher-yield­ing cor­po­rate bonds and other al­ter­na­tive in­vest­ments like com­modi­ties.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment-is­sued fixed in­come securities are con­sid­ered risk-free as the prin­ci­pal amount in­vested is guar­an­teed against de­fault.</p>
    <p>Cor­po­rate bonds, on the other hand, are only as good as the fi­nan­cial health of the com­pany is­su­ing them. If the com­pany goes bust, bond hold­ers can lose all or a sub­stan­tial part of their in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>The Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore does not set bench­mark in­ter­est rates like other cen­tral banks do. It uses the ex­change rate as the in­ter­me­di­ate tar­get of mon­e­tary pol­icy, al­low­ing do­mes­tic in­ter­est rates to move along with for­eign rates.</p>
    <p>Do­mes­tic in­ter­est rates have typ­i­cally been be­low United States lev­els. With the US Fed­eral Re­serve tar­get­ing its bench­mark in the range of 0 per cent to 0.25 per cent, the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­bank Of­fered Rate (Si­bor) dropped to 0.41 per cent on Sept 30 – the low­est level in six years, ac­cord­ing to Bloomberg data.</p>
    <p>The drop in the bench­mark Si­bor has pulled bond yields down across the board, with re­turns on gov­ern­ment securities suf­fer­ing the most.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the Oc­to­ber is­sue of Sin­ga­pore Sav­ings Bonds (SSB) of­fers an in­ter­est rate of 0.26 per cent for the first year – the low­est level since the bonds were launched in 2015.</p>
    <p>This SSB rate pales in com­par­i­son with rates of as high as 1.3 per cent be­ing of­fered by some banks for a one-year fixed de­posit.</p>
    <p>How­ever, re­turns on these de­posits have also dropped from highs of above 2 per cent, and un­like SSBs, where rates are locked – usu­ally for 10 years – fixed de­posit rates can move ei­ther way ev­ery time they are rolled over for an­other year.</p>
    <p>Cor­po­rate bonds, on the other hand, have made an im­pres­sive re­cov­ery from the peak of the cri­sis in March-April when the Covid-19 out­break turned into a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Bloomberg Bar­clays Global Ag­gre­gate In­dex, which cov­ers in­vest­ment-grade bonds in gen­eral, has re­turned close to 6 per cent year to date – bet­ter than the red-hot US S&P 500 stock in­dex, which has re­turned 5.5 per cent in the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Mr Kelvin Goh, head of wealth ad­vi­sory at OCBC Bank, be­lieves in­vestors will have to weigh the op­tions of tak­ing on more risk by in­vest­ing in longer dated bonds or go­ing down the credit qual­ity curve for higher yield.</p>
    <p>“This may have the in­ad­ver­tent ef­fect of greater ex­po­sure to the credit risk of com­pa­nies which are still grap­pling with an uncer­tain eco­nomic out­look,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Jake Foo, fixed in­come an­a­lyst at DBS Bank, said that in­vestors who can af­ford the risk-re­turn trade-off should favour cor­po­rate bonds over gov­ern­ment ones.</p>
    <p>In­come seek­ers in­vested in cor­po­rate bonds will be re­warded with ex­cess re­turns as the high de­mand for such bonds will pull their yields down and close to gov­ern­ment bonds – a phe­nom­e­non called spread com­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>Mr Foo be­lieves that bonds is­sued by for­eign com­pa­nies here in Sin­ga­pore of­fer bet­ter re­turns if the po­ten­tial for spread com­pres­sion is taken into ac­count.</p>
    <p>“Sim­i­lar to other risk as­sets, Sin­ga­pore dol­lar (SGD) bonds sold off sharply in the first half of 2020 but have since re­bounded sig­nif­i­cantly. How­ever, SGD bonds is­sued by for­eign com­pa­nies are gen­er­ally lag­ging be­hind bonds is­sued by do­mes­tic Sin­ga­pore com­pa­nies,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Chung Shaw Bee, Sin­ga­pore and re­gional head of wealth man­age­ment at United Overseas Bank, said in­vestors should un­der­stand the risks of any in­vest­ment ahead of any po­ten­tial re­ward.</p>
    <p>“In­vestors who adopt a bal­anced ap­proach to in­vest­ing are also able to min­imise tak­ing on ex­ces­sive risks in their port­fo­lios,” she said.</p>
    <p>“In ad­di­tion, di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion is key to re­duc­ing risks in an in­vest­ment port­fo­lio, to weath­er­ing dif­fer­ent mar­ket cy­cles and to gen­er­at­ing steady re­turns over the long term.”</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, to min­imise the credit risk, in­vestors can buy fixed in­come ex­change-traded funds (ETFs) that en­able them to di­ver­sify port­fo­lios across a bas­ket of bonds at a low cost.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change, ex­clud­ing two re­cent list­ings, fixed in­come ETFs have de­liv­ered one-year an­nu­alised re­turns of be­tween 3.3 per cent and 7.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>In­vestor in­ter­est in these ETFs is clear: Turnover has ex­ceeded $350 mil­lion so far this year, a 122 per cent growth over the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion is key to re­duc­ing risks in an in­vest­ment port­fo­lio, to weath­er­ing dif­fer­ent mar­ket cy­cles and to gen­er­at­ing steady re­turns over the long term.</p>
