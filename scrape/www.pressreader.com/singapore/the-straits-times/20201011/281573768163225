    <p>PE­TAL­ING JAYA • Sev­eral Umno MPs have started lodg­ing po­lice re­ports to deny ac­cu­sa­tions that they are sup­port­ing Datuk Seri An­war Ibrahim as the next Prime Min­is­ter of Malaysia.</p>
    <p>They have re­sorted to lodg­ing po­lice re­ports as their names are on the list of MPs be­ing spread on so­cial me­dia, al­leg­ing they sup­port Mr An­war’s claim that he has a “for­mi­da­ble” group of MPs be­hind him to top­ple the govern­ment of Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin.</p>
    <p>Some of these MPs had al­ready is­sued state­ments deny­ing any in­volve­ment on the plot by Mr An­war, but they felt the need to lodge com­plaints with the po­lice j ust be­fore Mr An­war is sched­uled to meet the Malaysian King on Tues­day to present his list of MPs.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Muhyid­din, who came to power seven months ago in a ma­jor re­align­ment of MPs, has the sup­port of 113 MPs in the 222-seat Par­lia­ment at the last count. This is just two more than the min­i­mum 111 needed to pass Bills and stave off a no-con­fi­dence mo­tion against him.</p>
    <p>There has been wide­spread spec­u­la­tion in the last two weeks since Mr An­war’s claim, that he has the sup­port of 120 or 121 fed­eral law­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war has been coy about who ac­tu­ally are on his list, say­ing he must first show it to Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ri’ay­atud­din.</p>
    <p>His claim gained cre­dence af­ter Umno pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi said he knew “many” Umno leg­is­la­tors sup­port Mr An­war, but that the party is pow­er­less to stop them. Umno has 38 MPs, the sec­ond big­gest num­ber held by a sin­gle party in Par­lia­ment af­ter the 42 seats held by the op­po­si­tion Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party.</p>
    <p>Umno MP Shahi­dan Kas­sim from Perlis said he has di­rected his aide to lodge a po­lice re­port on his be­half as he is un­der self-quar­an­tine at home.</p>
    <p>“I am sur­prised my name is on the list of MPs al­legedly sup­port­ing An­war as no­body had called or ap­proached me,” he said when con­tacted yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“I asked my aide to lodge a po­lice re­port on my be­half re­cently as I have vol­un­tar­ily put my­self un­der ex­tended self-quar­an­tine while await­ing the third Covid-19 test re­sult although the first two tests re­turned neg­a­tive,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Shahi­dan said he is a party man, and he would fol­low only Umno’s de­ci­sion on who to sup­port.</p>
    <p>“My party is Barisan Na­sional, Muafakat Na­sional, and cur­rently Perikatan Na­sional as Umno MPs are hold­ing Cabi­net posts. If Umno no longer sup­ported Perikatan, its MPs would not be hold­ing Cabi­net posts,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Shahi­dan said it was ir­re­spon­si­ble of Mr An­war to use the me­dia to stake the claim that he had the majority to form a new govern­ment.</p>
    <p>“If he had the num­bers, he should prove it in Par­lia­ment or present it be­fore the Yang di-Per­tuan Agong (King),” the vet­eran MP said. ”Why make a pre-emp­tive an­nounce­ment in the me­dia, trig­ger­ing the per­cep­tion of po­lit­i­cal in­sta­bil­ity?” he added.</p>
    <p>Pa­hang MP Ah­mad Na­zlan Idris has also lodged a po­lice re­port deny­ing he had en­dorsed any statu­tory dec­la­ra­tion sup­port­ing Mr An­war as the next Prime Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Datuk Ah­mad Na­zlan said nei­ther Mr An­war nor his rep­re­sen­ta­tive had ever ap­proached him to dis­cuss the mat­ter. “Claims that I sup­port An­war are not true,” he said.</p>
    <p>Of the list of 121 MPs al­legedly sup­port­ing Mr An­war, 22 are from Umno. Fif­teen of these have openly de­nied sup­port­ing him.</p>
