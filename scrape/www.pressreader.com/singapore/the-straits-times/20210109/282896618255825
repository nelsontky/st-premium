    <p>When it came to ren­o­vat­ing their ex­ec­u­tive flat in Wood­lands, hav­ing ad­e­quate space for en­ter­tain­ing was a key con­sid­er­a­tion for Mr Ken Chin and Ms Case­lyn Lee as they host friends and fam­ily of­ten.</p>
    <p>The 20some­thing cou­ple wanted an open plan that would al­low ev­ery­one to move seam­lessly from the din­ing area to the liv­ing area in the 1,400 sq ft home.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing cel­e­bra­tions, we want peo­ple to feel like they’re to­gether even when they’re in dif­fer­ent parts of the home,” says Ms Lee, a fi­nan­cial consultant.</p>
    <p>This idea of shar­ing a com­mu­nal space was in­spired by Mr Chin’s fre­quent stays in hos­tels over­seas. The civil ser­vant and his wife also wanted a mono­chrome pal­ette and ho­tel-like am­bi­ence.</p>
    <p>To ex­e­cute their de­sign plan, they ap­proached Ms Sher­lynn Low, founder of home-grown in­te­rior de­sign com­pany Mil­lime­ters Stu­dio.</p>
    <p>She re­con­fig­ured the lay­out. The orig­i­nal kitchen wall made way for an in­te­grated kitchen and din­ing space, and one of the three be­d­rooms was re­moved to cre­ate a larger mas­ter bed­room, en-suite bath­room and walk-in wardrobe.</p>
    <p>As the cou­ple of­ten so­cialise over meals, Ms Low made the din­ing area a fo­cal point. The kitchen is­land and din­ing ta­ble can be eas­ily joined to­gether to form one long sur­face, and the clean lines are mir­rored in the grid de­sign that runs the length of the ceil­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Low says: “The ceil­ing grid proved to be a ver­sa­tile de­sign el­e­ment. It not only con­ceals the wiring for the lamps, but also al­lows the cou­ple to hang fairy lights and plants for spe­cial oc­ca­sions.”</p>
    <p>Al­though the home own­ers were ini­tially con­cerned about the grid re­duc­ing the height of the ceil­ing, it has had quite the op­po­site ef­fect as it draws one’s eye up­wards.</p>
    <p>This de­sign el­e­ment is echoed through­out the home, with the liv­ing room show­cases, cof­fee ta­ble and the open-con­cept wardrobe.</p>
    <p>Com­bined with the black-and­grey pal­ette and com­ple­mented by luxe touches such as tinted mir­rors and chrome fin­ishes, the over­all look is con­tem­po­rary and in­dus­trial.</p>
    <p>To bal­ance the mono­chrome scheme, Ms Low used shades like yel­low for the ac­ces­sories. She also cu­rated pieces from the cou­ple’s col­lec­tion of travel me­mora­bilia to dis­play and cus­tom-painted bold graphic art­works for the walls.</p>
    <p>“Those with the al­pha­bets K and C were a house­warm­ing gift,” she says. These and the cou­ple’s me­men­tos give the home plenty of per­son­al­ity.</p>
    <p>A lot of thought also went into the light and spa­cious mas­ter bath­room, with his and hers basins and a luxurious 1.7m-long bath­tub.</p>
    <p>While el­e­ments were in­tro­duced for en­ter­tain­ing, Ms Low al­lo­cated plenty of space for cou­ple time.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, a counter by the liv­ing room win­dow of­fers an ex­pan­sive view of the green­ery out­side and has be­come the cou­ple’s favourite spot for working and read­ing.</p>
    <p>They moved in in March 2019 af­ter a three-month ren­o­va­tion that cost $120,000.</p>
    <p>“We wanted our home to have a ho­tel-like vibe so we’d al­ways feel like we’re on a stay­ca­tion. Sher­lynn helped us achieve that,” Ms Lee says with a smile.</p>
