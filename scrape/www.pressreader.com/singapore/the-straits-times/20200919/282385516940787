    <p>LON­DON Gareth Bale ar­rived at Lu­ton Air­port near Lon­don yes­ter­day, ahead of com­plet­ing his im­mi­nent re­turn to Tot­ten­ham Hot­spur.</p>
    <p>The Wales for­ward, who left Pre­mier League club Spurs to join Real Madrid for a then-world record €100 mil­lion (S$161 mil­lion) i n 2013, was ex­pected to be un­veiled yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Sky Sports footage showed him step­ping off a pri­vate jet owned by Tot­ten­ham chair­man Daniel Levy.</p>
    <p>Real Madrid left-back Ser­gio Reguilon was also on the plane and is also set to join the Lon­don club.</p>
    <p>Bale, 31, is ex­pected to join ini­tially on loan. He orig­i­nally joined Tot­ten­ham from Southamp­ton in 2007 and, af­ter strug­gling ini­tially, evolved into one of the club’s great­est play­ers. He scored 56 goals and pro­vided 58 as­sists in more than 200 ap­pear­ances. Af­ter j oin­ing Real, he won four Cham­pi­ons League and two La Liga ti­tles, but has fallen out of favour with coach Zine­dine Zi­dane.</p>
    <p>With Spurs new sign­ing Matt Do­herty, a right-back, and Reguilon ar­riv­ing this sea­son, man­ager Jose Mour­inho could opt to play a wing­back for­ma­tion which could bring out the best in Bale.</p>
    <p>The idea could be that when the wing-backs ad­vance to join the at­tack, Bale and South Korean for­ward Son He­ung-min, two po­tent scor­ers, would then be able to get closer to Harry Kane to ease to the striker’s scor­ing load.</p>
    <p>Bale op­er­ates in this for­ma­tion well, as while he is still a threat get­ting by his mark­ers on the out­side, his main weapon now is to cut in­side on his left foot.</p>
    <p>While Do­herty pro­vides the width on the right, Mour­inho would be able to use Bale as an in­side for­ward, rather than an out­side right. Ac­cord­ing to Sky Sports, Bale found the net when cut­ting into the zone no fewer than nine times from out­side the penalty box in his most re­cent sea­son as a Pre­mier League player. No­body has come close to that num­ber since.</p>
    <p>Mour­inho may also be wary of</p>
    <p>Bale’s off-pitch is­sues.</p>
    <p>First, Spurs must get him back to full match fit­ness af­ter he scarcely played for Real in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>But the more press­ing prob­lem would be his am­bi­tions.</p>
    <p>Just last year, there were re­ports that he was leav­ing Real to join Chi­nese club Jiangsu Sun­ing on a three-year deal that would see him earn £1 mil­lion (S$1.75 mil­lion) a week, sug­gest­ing that he wants an easy pay day.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Liver­pool have com­pleted the sign­ing of Bayern Mu­nich mid­fielder Thi­ago Al­can­tara on a four-year deal worth an ini­tial £20 mil­lion, with £5 mil­lion in add-ons. He be­comes the club’s sec­ond sign­ing of the trans­fer win­dow af­ter Kostas Tsimikas.</p>
    <p>“I think it’s an amaz­ing feel­ing. I was wait­ing for this mo­ment for a long time and I am very, very happy to be here,” said the Spa­niard, 29.</p>
    <p>He spent seven sea­sons with Bayern and played in last sea­son’s Cham­pi­ons League fi­nal vic­tory over Paris Saint-Ger­main.</p>
