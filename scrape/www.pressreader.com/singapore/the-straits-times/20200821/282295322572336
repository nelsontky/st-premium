    <p>BARCELONA • Ron­ald Koe­man will “fight to put Barcelona back on top” after he was of­fi­cially ap­pointed on Wed­nes­day as the Span­ish La Liga club’s new coach on a two-year deal.</p>
    <p>“It’s a chal­lenge and it won’t be easy, it will de­mand the best of me and I like that,” the 57-year-old, who left his po­si­tion as coach of the Nether­lands na­tional team, said at his Nou Camp un­veil­ing.</p>
    <p>“It was a dream and this dream be­came a re­al­ity. We’re go­ing to fight to put Barca back on top.”</p>
    <p>The for­mer Ever­ton and Va­len­cia man­ager, who spent six tro­phy­laden cam­paigns as a Barca player from 1989 to 1995, win­ning their maiden Euro­pean Cup, added: “I’ve signed, I’m the coach of Barcelona and we’re go­ing to work start­ing from now.</p>
    <p>“Changes need to be made. The im­age from the other day is not the one we want to re­turn to, not me, nor the play­ers, di­rec­tors, sup­port­ers, any­one.”</p>
    <p>While crit­ics be­lieve Barca’s tik­i­taka pass­ing style may fast be over­whelmed by the high-in­ten­sity press­ing that is cur­rently in vogue, Koe­man in­sisted he would stay true to tra­di­tion and stick to pos­ses­sion-based foot­ball.</p>
    <p>He also rowed back on sug­ges­tions that the likes of veter­ans Luis Suarez, 33; Ser­gio Bus­quets, 32, and Jordi Alba, 31, and 33-year-old cap­tain Lionel Messi, who will be a free agent next sum­mer if no ex­ten­sion is agreed, were up for sale.</p>
    <p>“If de­ci­sions need to be made, we’ll take them,” he said. “A player who is 31, 32 years old, he’s not fin­ished. It’s all about the hunger he has to want to be at this club and give the max­i­mum.</p>
    <p>“He (Messi) still has a year on his con­tract, he’s part of Barca. I don’t know if I need to con­vince him. He’s the best player in the world. And you want to have the best in your team, not against you.</p>
    <p>“As a man­ager, I love the idea of coach­ing Messi. He wins matches on his own. I will speak to him, but I hope he will stay here for sev­eral more years.”</p>
    <p>Koe­man re­places Quique Se­tien, who was fired on Mon­day after a hu­mil­i­at­ing 8-2 loss in the Champions League against Bayern Munich. It was the first time they had con­ceded eight goals in a game since 1946.</p>
