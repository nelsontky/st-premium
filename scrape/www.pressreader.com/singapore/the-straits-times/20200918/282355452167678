    <p>•</p>
    <p>SHANG­HAI Lux­ury-watch maker Of­ficine Pan­erai-Firenze is famed for its big and bulky World War IIera wrist pieces. But its best­sellers are now be­com­ing smaller and smaller, largely due to the might of Chi­nese buy­ers.</p>
    <p>Though its orig­i­nal mil­i­tary watches had di­als stretch­ing 60mm, the Swiss brand now sells mod­els as small as 38mm in China, due to the lo­cal pref­er­ence for more dis­creet prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>The watch­maker’s pivot is an ex­am­ple of how lux­ury-good mak­ers are re­tool­ing them­selves to suit Chi­nese tastes.</p>
    <p>This pro­cess is be­ing ac­cel­er­ated by the Asian na­tion’s re­bound as the rest of the world still reels from the eco­nomic dev­as­ta­tion of the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“China, for the first time in the his­tory of the brand, will be­come our No. 1 coun­try this year,” said Mr Jean-Marc Pon­troue, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Pan­erai, a unit of Swiss lux­ury group Richemont.</p>
    <p>“Now that we have a clear view of how big China is for the brand, how much even big­ger it could be in the fu­ture, we know where to fo­cus our in­vest­ments.”</p>
    <p>China, where the novel pathogen first emerged, has be­come a life­line for the lux­ury in­dus­try amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Driven by pent-up de­sire to spend af­ter months of so­cial dis­tanc­ing and un­able to travel overseas, Chi­nese con­sumers are splurg­ing at home.</p>
    <p>Lux­ury de­mand on the main­land may surge 10 per cent this year, even as it plunges 45 per cent glob­ally, Bos­ton Con­sult­ing Group es­ti­mated in June.</p>
    <p>AD­JUST STRATE­GIES</p>
    <p>That is push­ing global brands to ad­just their long­stand­ing prac­tices, strate­gies and brand iden­ti­ties to cater to Chi­nese cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Louis Vuit­ton held its lat­est men’s show first in Shang­hai last month.</p>
    <p>The an­nual in­ter­na­tional watch fair for Richemont brands known as Watches & Won­ders – an elite in­dus­try event hosted usu­ally in Geneva – was brought for the first time to Shang­hai this week. In April, the Geneva fair was re­placed by an on­line ver­sion.</p>
    <p>Brands such as Louis Vuit­ton, Givenchy and Chloe have also started us­ing live stream­ing to push prod­ucts in China – a pop­u­lar style of so­cial com­merce where an in­flu­encer speaks live, pro­mot­ing and try­ing out items.</p>
    <p>All ma­jor brands saw soar­ing sales in the past few months, said Mr Ja­son Yu, man­ag­ing direc­tor at Kan­tar World­panel Greater China.</p>
    <p>LVMH’s China sales last quar­ter rose more than 65 per cent from a year ago, while the over­all rev­enue for the wine-to-watches lux­ury group dropped 38 per cent.</p>
    <p>Es­tee Lauder’s sales in main­land China jumped 60 per cent, while Ker­ing saw sales rise by more than 40 per cent af­ter a hit in the first quar­ter.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve the China mar­ket is big enough to jus­tify any prod­uct adap­ta­tion,” Mr Yu said. “A one-siz­e­fits-all ap­proach is less likely to suc­ceed.”</p>
    <p>BEEF UP PRES­ENCE</p>
    <p>Be­yond shrink­ing its watch di­als, Pan­erai plans to add eight new stores by March to beef up its pres­ence be­yond the mega-cities of Bei­jing and Shang­hai.</p>
    <p>It cur­rently has 57 stores in China, ac­count­ing for about 40 per cent of its global net­work. It will open two stores in Hainan in the next two months af­ter its first pop-up store achieved “ex­cep­tional” suc­cess, Mr Pon­troue said.</p>
    <p>China re­cently ex­panded its taxfree rules in the is­land of Hainan.</p>
    <p>Opened in June, the foot traf­fic at Hainan’s pop-up store is al­most dou­ble that of the pre-Covid level foot traf­fic seen in its flag­ship Hong Kong store – the com­pany’s largest bou­tique by space.</p>
    <p>Hainan is mak­ing up 30 per cent to 50 per cent of Pan­erai’s lost Hong Kong sales, he said.</p>
    <p>China’s bil­lion-plus and in­creas­ingly af­flu­ent buy­ers also make a fer­tile test­ing ground for the com­pany to test new prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>“It’s a very good lab­o­ra­tory to test new ideas,” Mr Pon­troue said.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing China as our prime tar­get is also a very good pa­ram­e­ter to see if the new con­cept is a po­ten­tial suc­cess or not.”</p>
