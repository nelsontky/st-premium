    <p>Covid-19 has been a stress­ful pe­riod for many, but it is even more dif­fi­cult for those with men­tal health is­sues, said Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>She was speak­ing at the of­fi­cial open­ing of a new ac­tiv­ity hub un­der Psalt Care, a char­ity ded­i­cated to help­ing those with men­tal health and ad­dic­tion chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>She said it is cru­cial to pro­vide care for those with men­tal health chal­lenges in the com­mu­nity, as Psalt Care has done. “We don’t want to have ev­ery­one with men­tal health chal­lenges go­ing to in­sti­tu­tional care. I think that’s not de­sir­able, not good for the in­di­vid­ual or so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>Psalt Care, es­tab­lished in 2014, is one of the so­cial ser­vice agen­cies sup­ported by the Pres­i­dent’s Chal­lenge. There are cur­rently about 180 peo­ple who use its ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Psalt Care’s ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor Jackie Tay said the new ac­tiv­ity hub in Jalan Lepas in Hougang is meant to be a “place for peers by peers”, where those seek­ing to re­cover from men­tal health con­di­tions can find sup­port from oth­ers with sim­i­lar con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>It is called Betsy’s Place in hon­our of the late Mrs Betsy Winslow, an avid sup­porter of so­cial causes whose son is Psalt Care’s found­ing direc­tor Mu­nidasa Winslow.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay said he hoped more such places will be set up across Sin­ga­pore in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that those with men­tal health is­sues need ad­di­tional sup­port and en­cour­age­ment, Madam Hal­imah high­lighted the im­por­tance of peer sup­port pro­grammes, such as those run by Psalt Care, in help­ing them along their jour­ney.</p>
    <p>Psalt Care’s pro­grammes in­clude reg­u­lar sup­port meet­ings, work­shops and coun­selling.</p>
    <p>“If you were to tell some­one with men­tal health is­sues to do this or that... it is not as ef­fec­tive as peers do­ing it, be­cause they have gone through the same ex­pe­ri­ence,” said Madam Hal­imah, adding that many of the ben­e­fi­cia­ries, clients and peers have told her that Psalt Care had be­come a safe space for them, as well as like a sec­ond home.</p>
