    <p>I took up cy­cling af­ter the cir­cuit breaker, to ease the monotony of work­ing, sleep­ing and eat­ing in the same apart­ment. Af­ter bor­row­ing a friend’s fold­able Brompton for weeks, I got my­self a fold­able Tern.</p>
    <p>Since then, I have tra­versed park con­nec­tors and foot­paths. I do not have con­fi­dence to ride on roads, but have edged gin­gerly to­wards rid­ing on bi­cy­cle lanes that run along­side roads.</p>
    <p>The first time I did so, on Sen­tosa is­land, I was ex­hil­a­rated but ner­vous. When lor­ries trun­dled past, too close for my lik­ing, my bike wob­bled and I bal­anced it with dif­fi­culty.</p>
    <p>As a new­bie cy­clist, I of­ten saw Face­book posts of peo­ple who had rid­den down Tanah Merah Coast Road, which con­nects East Coast Park to Changi Beach Park via a 10km fully on-road cy­cling lane.</p>
    <p>One day, I vowed, I would con­quer TMCR, as it is fondly short-handed by the cy­cling com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>So one bu­colic evening, I did. I rode out from East Coast to Changi on the park con­nec­tor on the pave­ment, heeding the ad­vice of my cy­cling mate to avoid the cy­cling lane which was too close for com­fort to the many con­struc­tion lor­ries thun­der­ing down the road at that peak hour. At Changi Vil­lage, we stopped for din­ner. For­ti­fied, I de­cided to brave the on-road bike lane on the re­turn jour­ney, as the traf­fic had also thinned.</p>
    <p>Within min­utes, I was beam­ing. The ride is just smoother on the tar­mac. I rode as the sky dark­ened; the air cooled, and the night hush deep­ened. Cy­cling is med­i­ta­tion in ac­tion: The wheels race, the wind blows in your face, time seems to slow, and you are fully in the mo­ment – body poised, mind still yet alert, heart afloat.</p>
    <p>Rid­ing on park con­nec­tors is nice, but hav­ing to con­stantly avoid pedes­tri­ans is dis­tract­ing. Rid­ing on roads is nerve-rack­ing for all but sea­soned rid­ers. For recre­ational cy­clists like me, or those who want to com­mute on bikes for the last-mile connection, ded­i­cated bike lanes are the best.</p>
    <p>So when Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung spoke about the pos­si­bil­ity of turn­ing some un­der­used roads into cy­cling lanes, I cheered.</p>
    <p>He said: “The lower traf­fic and new travel pat­terns brought about by Covid-19 have opened a win­dow of op­por­tu­nity to reimag­ine our road in­fra­struc­ture.” Less-used roads could be con­verted to bus or cy­cling lanes, or pedes­tri­anised.</p>
    <p>When the speech was made in Au­gust, I con­tem­plated drop­ping the Min­istry of Trans­port (MOT) an e-mail to sug­gest that the stretch of road out­side my home be tri­alled for con­ver­sion to a cy­cling lane.</p>
    <p>It is al­ready on the path of many cy­clists rid­ing to Mandai or Wood­lands. In­stead of driv­ing 30km to East Coast for my rid­ing high, I en­vis­aged do­ing so from my doorstep.</p>
    <p>I de­sisted be­cause, be­fore we con­vert more roads to cy­cling lanes, we have to make sure road users are ready.</p>
    <p>MOT should learn from its ex­pe­ri­ence with per­sonal mo­bil­ity de­vices (PMDs), when a law was passed in 2017 to let PMDs and bi­cy­cles be used on pub­lic paths such as pave­ments – and then tweaked along the way, af­ter a se­ries of ac­ci­dents.</p>
    <p>Over the years, reg­u­la­tions were in­tro­duced on PMD us­age, speed lim­its were in­tro­duced and low­ered, and li­cens­ing re­quire­ments were tight­ened. And then a year ago, the rule was over­turned and mo­torised PMDs were banned from foot­paths.</p>
    <p>Of course, there were many ben­e­fits to al­low­ing PMDs on pave­ments be­fore they were banned – many peo­ple used these to be­come food-de­liv­ery rid­ers, or used them for last-mile con­nec­tions to link up with the MRT or bus from home to their work­place. But for pedes­tri­ans, PMDs were a men­ace, turn­ing leisurely strolls in parks into haz­ardous ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>If not care­fully planned and im­ple­mented, there is a risk that cre­at­ing more on-road cy­cling lanes can see the same cy­cle: re­lax­ation – angst – ac­ci­dents – tight­en­ing – over­turn­ing.</p>
    <p>So what has to be done, be­fore un­der­used roads are con­verted to cy­cling lanes?</p>
    <p>CLAR­I­FY­ING RULES</p>
    <p>First, clar­ity in rules.</p>
    <p>The Road Traf­fic Act and Ac­tive Mo­bil­ity Act are among the laws that gov­ern be­hav­iour of cy­clists. But many rules are new, or were up­dated re­cently, which means many Sin­ga­pore­ans prob­a­bly do not know the lat­est rules.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, can cy­clists ride two abreast, which is not un­com­mon in group rides? Such be­hav­iour of­ten draws dis­ap­proval from mo­torists.</p>
    <p>The an­swer is “yes”, ac­cord­ing to the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity’s web­site on rules for cy­clists. Cy­clists are per­mit­ted to ride two abreast or on roads with more than one lane.</p>
    <p>Oth­er­wise, they should keep “as near as prac­ti­ca­ble to the far left edge of the road”, as dic­tated by the Road Traf­fic Act un­der the Road Traf­fic (Bi­cy­cles) Rules sec­tion.</p>
    <p>An­other quandary: If there is a ded­i­cated bike lane, can cy­clists go be­yond the lane onto the main road? For ex­am­ple, can you go be­yond the bike lane to over­take?</p>
    <p>Un­der the Road Traf­fic (Bi­cy­cle) Rules, the an­swer is “no”. “When a bi­cy­cle lane is pro­vided on part of a road, no bi­cy­cle, power-as­sisted bi­cy­cle, tr­ishaw or tri­cy­cle shall be used on any other part of the road­way.”</p>
    <p>On foot­paths, the rules say that bi­cy­cles must not ex­ceed 20kg or be wider than 70cm, cy­clists must ad­here to the speed limit of 10kmh on foot­paths and 25kmh on cy­cling paths, and the use of mo­bile com­mu­ni­ca­tion de­vices while rid­ing is dis­al­lowed on all pub­lic paths.</p>
    <p>‘RIGHT OF WAY’ NOT THE RIGHT AP­PROACH</p>
    <p>But what about rid­ing on roads with other ve­hi­cles?</p>
    <p>When a cy­clist wants to use a ze­bra cross­ing, for ex­am­ple, who has the right of way? Does the cy­clist need to dis­mount and push the bike across? Do mo­torists have to stop for a cy­clist rid­ing across the junc­tion? I ven­ture that many driv­ers and cy­clists will not know the an­swer. Although I am both a reg­u­lar mo­torist and cy­clist, I was not sure ei­ther and the an­swer was not easy to find on­line.</p>
    <p>So I turned to Mr Steven Lim, a safe-rid­ing ad­vo­cate since 2006 and pres­i­dent of the Safe Cy­cling Task Force, a reg­is­tered so­ci­ety,</p>
    <p>The fac­tual an­swer, he says, is that cy­clists need not dis­mount and push. They need, how­ever, to stop at the junc­tion and look out for traf­fic be­fore rid­ing across.</p>
    <p>But he adds that the whole no­tion of which road user has “right of way” is a wrong one.</p>
    <p>He ex­plains: “Right of way is not some­thing for users to in­sist on. Safety is im­por­tant. If you’re at a ze­bra cross­ing, as a pedes­trian you may have right of way and you just walk across the road. That is wrong. You must make sure the car has stopped for you first be­fore you walk.</p>
    <p>“Sim­i­larly, as a cy­clist, you may think you can ride across since you don’t need to dis­mount. But does the car driver know that and did he stop for you?</p>
    <p>“Right of way is of no use if it leads you to be­have in a cer­tain way that puts you in dan­ger. This is why I say right of way is not some­thing for a road user to ap­ply. It is for the Traf­fic Po­lice to ap­ply af­ter there is an ac­ci­dent, dur­ing an in­ves­ti­ga­tion. By then, for the road user, it may be too late.”</p>
    <p>Rather than in­sist on right of way, he says, the key is mindset change so that all road users learn to ac­com­mo­date one an­other as le­git­i­mate users – so mo­torists see cy­clists, who ride on roads yet do not pay road tax, as equal users and give way to them, and cy­clists do not vent their ire on pedes­tri­ans on shared paths.</p>
    <p>“We must find ways to co­ex­ist.</p>
    <p>It’s all about re­spect and tol­er­ance for each other as road users.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lim does not think ex­ist­ing rules are con­fus­ing, although he thinks they need to be more widely spread so all road users un­der­stand them clearly. This in­cludes the many for­eign­ers in Sin­ga­pore who cy­cle or are pedes­tri­ans.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim’s point is a good one. Af­ter all, for­eign cy­clists may bring ex­pec­ta­tions and be­hav­iour com­mon in their coun­tries to Sin­ga­pore. For ex­am­ple, in Ger­many, cy­clists can ride against the flow of traf­fic on one-way streets. On so-called bi­cy­cle streets there, “cy­clists may make use of the whole street whereas cars have to stay be­hind the cy­clists”, ac­cord­ing to the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion web­site.</p>
    <p>In the United States, vul­ner­a­ble road-user laws re­quire mo­torists to ob­serve min­i­mum safe dis­tances when pass­ing cy­clists, and im­pose se­vere penal­ties if a mo­torist in­jures a cy­clist or pedes­trian, who is deemed more vul­ner­a­ble as he is not pro­tected in a steel-caged ve­hi­cle.</p>
    <p>Con­flict will en­sue if for­eign cy­clists bring those ex­pec­ta­tions of mo­torists’ be­hav­iour to Sin­ga­pore and ex­pect driv­ers to give way to them.</p>
    <p>PUB­LIC ED­U­CA­TION</p>
    <p>So much as I would love to have more kilo­me­tres of tar­mac to ride on overnight, I think more pub­lic ed­u­ca­tion is needed to in­cul­cate good road-shar­ing habits. This in­cludes road-safety ba­sics about con­sid­er­a­tion and re­spect for other users.</p>
    <p>It is also im­por­tant to clar­ify and pub­li­cise ex­ist­ing rules gov­ern­ing cy­cling and PMDs, which have gone through many rounds of changes in the last few years.</p>
    <p>To add to the con­fu­sion, there are dif­fer­ent de­vices with dif­fer­ent weight and speed lim­its such as reg­u­lar pedal bi­cy­cles, e-bikes and e-scooters.</p>
    <p>There are also a myr­iad of paths and cross­ings with dif­fer­ent rules for each: rid­ing on the road; on on-road cy­cling lanes; on shared paths, in­clud­ing park con­nec­tors; on foot­paths such as pave­ments; at traf­fic junc­tions; at pedes­trian cross­ings; and, in­creas­ingly as more are built, at bi­cy­cle cross­ings.</p>
    <p>No won­der mo­torists and cy­clists alike are con­fused.</p>
    <p>One les­son from the PMD episode is that changes in road-us­age rules must be ac­com­pa­nied by clear rules, bet­ter pub­lic ed­u­ca­tion as well as reg­u­la­tion and en­force­ment.</p>
    <p>Just as mo­torised PMDs were re­quired to be reg­is­tered be­fore use, my view is that cy­clists who want to ride on roads, in­clud­ing on cy­cling lanes, should be re­quired to reg­is­ter, at­tend and pass a road-safety course, and pay a li­cens­ing fee. This creates ad­min­is­tra­tive has­sle but is nec­es­sary to en­sure a proper sys­tem of ed­u­ca­tion and ac­count­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>Cy­cling is a key plank of the car-lite strat­egy. Un­der LTA’s is­land­wide cy­cling net­work plan, the 440km cy­cling-path net­work (as at March this year) will ex­pand to 800km by 2023, when ev­ery HDB town will have cy­cling paths. By 2030, the net­work of paths will grow to 1,320km. These paths will con­nect to the park con­nec­tors al­ready criss-cross­ing the is­land.</p>
    <p>As more Sin­ga­pore­ans be­come more en­vi­ron­men­tally con­scious or want to adopt a health­ier life­style, cy­cling has po­ten­tial to be a vi­able last-mile op­tion for trans­port jour­neys. But while dou­bling down on the hard­ware of in­creas­ing cy­cling paths, just as much at­ten­tion needs to be paid to the soft­ware of up­grad­ing road users’ habits and mind­sets.</p>
