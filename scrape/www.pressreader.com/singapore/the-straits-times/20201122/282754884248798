    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>You have some­thing real star­ing you in the face and it may be tempt­ing to turn away. You have some good en­ergy, for sure, but if you are not up to this chal­lenge, call in the re­in­force­ments.</p>
    <p>Tau­rus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>This is the time to ex­pand your fo­cus – as wide as pos­si­ble. If you are a busi­ness owner, you need a new mar­ket. If you are sin­gle, you need an ex­panded pool of pos­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Gem­ini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>You do not get the point of an offhanded com­ment made by a col­league or friend, and the con­se­quences may take some time to un­ravel. Try not to let it sim­mer for very long.</p>
    <p>Cancer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>You get a dis­tress call mid­day or pos­si­bly later on and you need to give it your all. Your ter­rific en­ergy helps you rack up tons of karma as you make life easy for some­one you love.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Cre­ative juices are flow­ing all around you. Progress may be slower than you would like, but you can en­joy dream­ing up new ideas. It may be a bet­ter day than you had thought.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Re­mem­ber that ev­ery­thing changes to­day – some­times for the worse, but some­times for the bet­ter. You can­not al­ways know ahead of time, so be open to what­ever comes your way this time.</p>
    <p>Li­bra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Your rou­tines are shaken up by some­thing small that hap­pens early to­day, but you should not try too hard to force your sched­ule back into shape. Just let it ride and see what hap­pens.</p>
    <p>Scor­pio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>A wild idea gets stuck in your brain early to­day, but you are bet­ter off with it there. Keep play­ing with it un­til you see how to make it work. A lit­tle creativ­ity should serve you well.</p>
    <p>Sagit­tar­ius (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>You see morals ev­ery­where – it is like you are liv­ing in a book of fa­bles. Your en­ergy is a lit­tle thin, but you can still learn some im­por­tant lessons if you sit qui­etly and ob­serve.</p>
    <p>Capri­corn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>Your in­ner voice is loud and clear and it has plenty to say. You may find that you need to tell it to take a break at some point, so you can get to work on some­thing hard.</p>
    <p>Aquar­ius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>You may find that it is hard to get any work done, in part be­cause you keep get­ting dis­tracted with one lit­tle thing af­ter an­other. Some are fun, some are ir­ri­tat­ing, but none can be ig­nored.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>Try to help a friend in need. You can score bonus points with the uni­verse if you as­sist him with­out re­veal­ing that you are be­hind it. Your sneaky ways can help you win big.</p>
