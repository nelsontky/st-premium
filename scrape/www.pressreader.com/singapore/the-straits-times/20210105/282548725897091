    <p>“Is this Sin­ga­pore?” my hus­band’s col­leagues around the world ask in dis­be­lief over Zoom as he gives them a lap­top tour of the Dusit Thani La­guna Sin­ga­pore’s pool­side area.</p>
    <p>Dusit In­ter­na­tional’s first prop­erty here has that ef­fect on you. Un­like ho­tels in Sen­tosa which are set in lush forested plots or by the beach, this five-star ho­tel is flanked by the green fair­ways of La­guna Na­tional Golf & Re­sort Club’s two cham­pi­onship golf cour­ses.</p>
    <p>The ho­tel feels pri­vate and peace­ful – it helps that only 77 out of its 198 rooms are open when we check in on a Mon­day just be­fore Christ­mas. The oc­ca­sional roar of pas­sen­ger jets from nearby Changi Air­port sparks joy rather than ir­ri­ta­tion – only in a Covid-19 year, per­haps.</p>
    <p>While golf clubs such as Or­chid Coun­try Club have ho­tel rooms, the Dusit’s stun­ning ar­chi­tec­ture and in­te­ri­ors, dis­creetly op­u­lent fin­ish­ings and top-notch fa­cil­i­ties take it to the next level.</p>
    <p>We see touches of its Thai hos­pi­tal­ity roots, from the door­man dressed in a Thai cos­tume who chirps a greet­ing of “sawadee kap”, to the fresh co­conuts placed in our lovely deluxe La­guna pa­tio pool view room.</p>
    <p>Golfers will ap­pre­ci­ate the luxe lodg­ings, which al­low them to sleep a lit­tle bit longer be­fore an early tee-off. Ho­tel guests who are not mem­bers of La­guna Na­tional en­joy ac­cess when they book the Stay and Play pack­age.</p>
    <p>My hus­band plays 18 holes with a cou­ple who en­trust their baby to the ho­tel’s babysit­ting staff, and finds the Mas­ters course a sat­is­fy­ing chal­lenge, thanks to its many wa­ter haz­ards.</p>
    <p>La­guna Na­tional was the first golf club here to host Amer­i­can pro­fes­sional golfer Tiger Woods, among many other golf lu­mi­nar­ies over the years.</p>
    <p>I, on the other hand, am con­tent to frolic in the main pool, all 53 glo­ri­ous me­tres of it. Clev­erly con­structed with a very de­cent 30m lap pool area that se­ri­ous swim­mers will ap­pre­ci­ate, it also has built-in so­cial spa­ces (both wet and dry) for those who pre­fer to lounge.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the main pool, there is a fun kids’ pool that re­sem­bles a putting green, as well as a 32mlong re­lax­ation pool with chic chairs where you can read a book or sun­bathe with­out get­ting more than your an­kles wet.</p>
    <p>Go early to grab one of the comfy pool­side ca­banas be­cause they fill up by 10am. You can re­serve them for a fee of $100, which comes with $75 in food and bev­er­age credit.</p>
    <p>In line with the re­sort’s well­ness fo­cus, guests have ac­cess to a well equipped DFiT gym and De­varana Well­ness spa, which has seven treat­ment rooms.</p>
    <p>My 90-minute De­varana Sig­na­ture Mas­sage ($220++) com­bines Thai, ayurvedic and shi­atsu tech­niques with Swedish mas­sage and aro­mather­apy, and while ther­a­pist Ly­dia’s strokes are in­tense at times, she man­ages to put me in a sleepy stu­por mid­way through and I feel re­ju­ve­nated af­ter­wards.</p>
    <p>As the Dusit Thani La­guna Sin­ga­pore is still in its soft-launch phase, with an of­fi­cial open­ing slated for mid-year, not all its fa­cil­i­ties are fully op­er­a­tional.</p>
    <p>Its all-day din­ing restau­rant, Greenhouse, is cap­ti­vat­ing with its for­est theme and mag­nif­i­cent curved win­dows that look out onto the golf course. But only three of its five kitchens are open when I visit – the Chi­nese kitchen and Mediter­ranean one with a pizza oven are ex­pected to open next Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The sa­tay I have for lunch is good, but the rest of its of­fer­ings, in­clud­ing break­fast, are av­er­age con­sid­er­ing you pay five-star ho­tel prices. Still, I am sure it will im­prove and Greenhouse looks set to be a go-to din­ing des­ti­na­tion this year.</p>
    <p>Also in the works are three out­door ten­nis courts and a recre­ation room.</p>
    <p>La­guna Na­tional or­gan­ises work­shops and classes for its mem­bers, and ho­tel guests can also sign up if space per­mits, pay­ing $10 more than mem­bers. I peek into a Christ­mas bak­ing work­shop ($69 for 21/</p>
    <p>2 hours for mem­bers) and see chil­dren hap­pily knead­ing, rolling and cut­ting cook­ies.</p>
    <p>The work­shop is held in one of the Dusit’s eight dou­ble-storey pavil­ions, each of which has its own pool. Orig­i­nally planned as guest ac­com­mo­da­tion pre-Covid-19, some units are avail­able to the pub­lic for smallscale events such as cor­po­rate re­treats or wed­ding cer­e­monies.</p>
    <p>As dusk ar­rives and the Dusit’s curvi­lin­ear form twin­kles like a space­ship against the un­blocked sky, I re­alise that its ap­peal lies in its splen­did iso­la­tion away from the city and the usual ho­tel hubs.</p>
    <p>Driv­ing past the dusty mega con­struc­tion site of the East Coast In­te­grated De­pot to get to the ho­tel is some­what off-putting. (Dusit pro­vides shut­tle buses to and from Expo MRT sta­tion and Jewel Changi Air­port for those who do not drive.)</p>
    <p>But en­sconced in the re­sort’s co­coon of lux­ury, I feel like I am on hol­i­day for the first time since the pan­demic. If only I could keep it my lit­tle stay­cay se­cret for longer.</p>
