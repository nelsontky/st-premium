    <p>GENEVA/ZURICH • The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) on Wed­nes­day said healthy young peo­ple might have to wait un­til 2022 to be vac­ci­nated against Covid-19, as it warned against com­pla­cency in the disease death rate.</p>
    <p>De­spite the global push for a Covid-19 vac­cine, with dozens in clin­i­cal tri­als and hopes for ini­tial in­oc­u­la­tions this year, WHO chief sci­en­tist Soumya Swami­nathan re­it­er­ated that speedy, mass shots were un­likely, Reuters re­ported.</p>
    <p>Two can­di­dates, from John­son & John­son’s and As­traZeneca’s tri­als in the United States, have been halted on safety con­cerns, while man­u­fac­tur­ing bil­lions of doses of an even­tual suc­cess­ful vac­cine will be a colos­sal chal­lenge de­mand­ing hard de­ci­sions about who gets in­oc­u­lated first.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple tend to think that on the first of Jan­uary or the first of April, I’m go­ing to get the vac­cine, and then things will be back to nor­mal,” Dr Swami­nathan said dur­ing a WHO so­cial me­dia event.</p>
    <p>“It’s not go­ing to work like that.” She added that she hoped the world would have at least one safe and ef­fec­tive vac­cine by next year, but it would be avail­able only in “lim­ited quan­ti­ties”.</p>
    <p>“Most peo­ple agree, it’s start­ing with health­care work­ers, and front­line work­ers, but even there, you need to de­fine which of them are at high­est risk, and then the el­derly, and so on,” Dr Swami­nathan said.</p>
    <p>“There will be a lot of guid­ance com­ing out, but I think an av­er­age per­son, a healthy young per­son might have to wait un­til 2022 to get a vac­cine.”</p>
    <p>The WHO has said that let­ting the in­fec­tion spread in the hope of achiev­ing “herd im­mu­nity” is un­eth­i­cal and would cause un­nec­es­sary deaths. It urges hand wash­ing, so­cial dis­tanc­ing, masks and, when un­avoid­able, lim­ited and tar­geted re­stric­tions on move­ments, to con­trol disease spread.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple talk about herd im­mu­nity. We should talk about it only in the con­text of a vac­cine,” Reuters quoted Dr Swami­nathan as say­ing.</p>
    <p>“You need to vac­ci­nate at least 70 per cent of peo­ple... to re­ally break trans­mis­sion.”</p>
    <p>New cases are hit­ting 100,000 daily in Europe. Nearly 20,000 in­fec­tions were re­ported in Bri­tain, while Italy, Switzer­land and Rus­sia were among na­tions with record case numbers.</p>
    <p>While deaths glob­ally have fallen to around 5,000 a day from April’s peak ex­ceed­ing 7,500, Dr Swami­nathan said caseloads were ris­ing in in­ten­sive care units, Reuters re­ported.</p>
    <p>“Mor­tal­ity in­creases al­ways lag be­hind in­creas­ing cases by a cou­ple of weeks,” Dr Swami­nathan said.</p>
    <p>“We shouldn’t be com­pla­cent that death rates are com­ing down.”</p>
    <p>More than 38 mil­lion peo­ple have been re­ported in­fected glob­ally and 1.1 mil­lion have died.</p>
    <p>SLOW PROGRESS AHEAD</p>
    <p>Peo­ple tend to think that on the first of Jan­uary or the first of April, I’m go­ing to get the vac­cine, and then things will be back to nor­mal... It’s not go­ing to work like that.</p>
    <p>DR SOUMYA SWAMI­NATHAN,</p>
