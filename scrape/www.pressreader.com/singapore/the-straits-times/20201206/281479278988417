    <p>The woman needed a tra­cheotomy, which is a sur­gi­cal pro­ce­dure per­formed when you can­not breathe and doc­tors cut a hole in your throat to stick a rub­ber tube in to sup­ply your lungs and heart with oxy­gen.</p>
    <p>By her side in the Univer­sity of Mary­land’s Bal­ti­more Wash­ing­ton Med­i­cal Cen­tre, nurse Alie Cavey, 28, held up an iPad so the Covid-19-stricken woman, in her 60s or 70s, could talk to her daugh­ter. “Just let me die,” she re­peat­edly tried to say.</p>
    <p>Even­tu­ally the woman re­cov­ered and was pro­fusely thank­ful to the staff. She was one of the lucky ones, even though she may have to strug­gle with the long-term ef­fects of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The United States is in for a grim win­ter. Nearly 37,000 Amer­i­cans died of Covid-19 last month, the most in any month since this year’s sav­age spring.</p>
    <p>Death rates lag be­hind hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions, which are soar­ing again, lead­ing ex­perts to fore­cast that the coun­try could soon see 2,000 or more fa­tal­i­ties a day. That would be the equiv­a­lent of a ma­jor nat­u­ral dis­as­ter, like 2005’s Hur­ri­cane Ka­t­rina (1,800 deaths), every sin­gle day.</p>
    <p>Last Wed­nes­day, Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion direc­tor Robert Red­field warned: “I ac­tu­ally be­lieve (De­cem­ber, January and Fe­bru­ary) are go­ing to be the most dif­fi­cult time in the pub­lic health his­tory of this na­tion.”</p>
    <p>HOS­PI­TALS FILLING UP</p>
    <p>Hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions from the coro­n­avirus topped 100,000 last Thurs­day – more than dou­ble the num­ber at the be­gin­ning of last month.</p>
    <p>The to­tal death toll as at last Fri­day was 276,000.</p>
    <p>“If you tell me the hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions are up this week, I’ll tell you that sev­eral weeks down the road, the deaths will be up,” Dr Jeremy Faust, an emer­gency medicine physi­cian at Brigham and Women’s Hos­pi­tal in Bos­ton, told The New York Times.</p>
    <p>And, un­like the spring, when the cases were con­cen­trated in a few states, this time they are na­tion­wide – helped, epi­demi­ol­o­gists say, by last week­end’s Thanks­giv­ing hol­i­day, which saw mil­lions ig­nor­ing pleas not to travel.</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia Gov­er­nor Gavin New­som has is­sued new re­stric­tions, with hos­pi­tal in­ten­sive care units filling up rapidly.</p>
    <p>Bay Area health of­fi­cials plan to im­ple­ment stay-at-home or­ders as soon as to­day – and keep them in place un­til af­ter the Christ­mas and New Year hol­i­day pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“There’s no rea­son to wait,” said Santa Clara County Ex­ec­u­tive Jeff Smith. “It’s sort of like wait­ing to put the brakes on when you’re about to go over the cliff. If you’re go­ing to get the pub­lic health bene</p>
    <p>fit, you have to do it now.”</p>
    <p>The hu­man tragedy is mount­ing. The eco­nomic crash trig­gered by the pan­demic is bit­ing ever deeper as states move to re­strict gath­er­ings again; re­ports say 26 mil­lion Amer­i­cans do not have enough to eat and long queues can be seen at food banks. Churches are among those sup­ply­ing food aid.</p>
    <p>Mil­lions of Amer­i­cans face los­ing sup­port pro­grammes at the end of the month, as Congress has failed to agree on re­lief and stim­u­lus mea­sures; it has un­til the end of this week to do so.</p>
    <p>Hos­pi­tals across the coun­try are near ca­pac­ity and mak­ing con­tin­gen­cies for mo­bile re­frig­er­a­tor trucks to func­tion as tem­po­rary morgues. Re­ports are mount­ing of lo­cal au­thor­i­ties, from McLen­nan County in Texas to Cuya­hoga and neigh­bour­ing Stark County in Ohio, al­ready or­der­ing or us­ing them.</p>
    <p>MEN­TAL STRAIN</p>
    <p>Health­care work­ers (HCWs) also face “ag­gra­vated psy­cho­log­i­cal pres­sure and even men­tal ill­ness”,</p>
    <p>con­cluded an Oc­to­ber Na­tional In­sti­tute of Health (NIH) pa­per af­ter a re­view of data and re­ports.</p>
    <p>The caseload has re­lent­lessly in­creased. Deaths have risen. “It is ex­pected of HCWs to work long hours while they are un­der over­whelm­ing pres­sure,” the NIH said.</p>
    <p>It added: “They are at the risk of be­ing in­fected when treat­ing ill pa­tients. On the other hand, like other in­di­vid­u­als, they are ex­posed to a con­sid­er­able amount of fake news and ru­mours, all of which in­crease their anx­i­ety.”</p>
    <p>Ms Cavey, a mother of two boys, aged one and three, told The Sun­day Times: “It’s def­i­nitely a men­tal strug­gle.”</p>
    <p>“There’s re­ally no out­let be­cause we’re so over­worked dur­ing this time. And hon­estly, we have not ad­dressed our men­tal health as much as we should at this point be­cause we haven’t had rest,” she added.</p>
    <p>“It’s just re­ally hard. We have to be strong for our pa­tients be­cause they don’t have fam­ily at the bed­side be­cause of all the re­stric­tions. But when we’re walk­ing a thin line with our own men­tal health, it’s hard to help them cope... There’s</p>
    <p>been a l ot of nurses that j ust couldn’t take it any­more,” Ms Cavey said.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know the ex­act num­ber, but we’ve had a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of res­ig­na­tions in the hos­pi­tal be­cause... they can’t do it much longer, so they go else­where.”</p>
    <p>DIF­FER­ENT KIND OF FEAR</p>
    <p>The fear now is dif­fer­ent from back in the spring. Then, there was the fear of the un­known, and HCWs did not have enough per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment. In the ini­tial phase of the pan­demic, 29 per cent of all hos­pi­talised pa­tients were HCWs.</p>
    <p>Now, though staff are bet­ter equipped and more prac­tised at car­ing for Covid-19 pa­tients, the fear is of not be­ing able to cope with the flood.</p>
    <p>“The spread is just so mas­sive at this point that it is over­whelm­ing sys­tems ev­ery­where,” said Mr Bob At­las, pres­i­dent and chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Mary­land Hos­pi­tal As­so­ci­a­tion. “The strain is real right now. And we re­ally have to hope that peo­ple will pull back, if not vol­un­tar­ily then, as is hap­pen­ing in some other states, with more re­stric­tions... on move­ment in pub­lic spa­ces and things like that.”</p>
    <p>Ms Cavey said: “It’s a scary thing think­ing if the spike is go­ing to get worse, where are we go­ing to put all these pa­tients? Who’s go­ing to take care of all these pa­tients?”</p>
    <p>There’s been a lot of nurses that just couldn’t take it any­more. I don’t know the ex­act num­ber, but we’ve had a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of res­ig­na­tions in the hos­pi­tal be­cause... they can’t do it much longer, so they go else­where.</p>
