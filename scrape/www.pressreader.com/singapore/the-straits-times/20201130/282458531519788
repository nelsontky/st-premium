    <p>A mag­nif­i­cent sec­ond-half turn­around – which in­cluded three goals in 14 min­utes – helped Tampines Rovers beat Al­birex Ni­igata 4-1 last night and dis­place the Ja­panese side at the top of the Sin­ga­pore Premier League (SPL).</p>
    <p>With each team hav­ing just two games left this sea­son, the ti­tle race now looks likely to go down to the wire on Satur­day. Tampines are on 27 points, with Al­birex a point be­hind.</p>
    <p>Third-placed Lion City Sailors, who beat the Young Lions 4-0 yes­ter­day at Jurong West Sta­dium, are four points be­hind Tampines.</p>
    <p>The task for Tampines is clear: Win their two re­main­ing games and they will claim their sixth league ti­tle and first since 2013. They host the Sailors on Wednesday and end the sea­son against Gey­lang In­ter­na­tional.</p>
    <p>Said coach Gavin Lee: “The most im­por­tant thing for us now is to re­cover and try to be as fresh as pos­si­ble for the next game.</p>
    <p>“Nei­ther team is go­ing to be at 100 per cent, but we’ll just re­it­er­ate what we want to do, and stay calm. A lot of things can hap­pen in foot­ball and we’ll just con­trol what we can con­trol.”</p>
    <p>Keep­ing calm, he added, was the key to last night’s come­back af­ter Al­birex went ahead at Jurong East Sta­dium through To­moyuki Doi in the 38th minute.</p>
    <p>Lee threw on wing-backs Madhu Mo­hana and Ir­wan Shah at the start of the sec­ond half, and the move paid in­stant div­i­dends.</p>
    <p>Just three min­utes af­ter the restart, Madhu was per­fectly placed to set up Boris Ko­pi­tovic to equalise from close range.</p>
    <p>Eight min­utes later, Amirul Adli put Tampines in front when poor de­fend­ing at a cor­ner by Al­birex saw the ball break to him at the far post.</p>
    <p>The Stags then ex­tended their lead in the 62nd minute when Madhu seized on a slip by Hiroyoshi Ka­mata and played Ko­pi­tovic in again, with the Mon­tene­grin striker fin­ish­ing with aplomb on his sec­ond try.</p>
    <p>Tampines sub­sti­tute Tau­fik Su­parno then added gloss to the score­line in the 88th minute, latch­ing onto a stray pass by Ya­suhiro Hanada and fir­ing home the fourth.</p>
    <p>Said Madhu: “We came back in the sec­ond half once be­fore against Young Lions (on Nov 17) and we know we’re a good enough team to do it against Al­birex too.</p>
    <p>“We just stayed calm and did not panic. Now, we have to for­get this re­sult and fo­cus on the Sailors. It’s not easy but we have the depth to get the re­sults we need.”</p>
    <p>Last night’s re­sult helped Tampines pull off a dou­ble over Al­birex, af­ter a 2-0 win last month, and White Swans coach Keiji Shige­tomi pointed to the Stags’ ex­pe­ri­ence as be­ing the dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“In the sec­ond half, my play­ers were over­whelmed by the op­po­nent and lost pos­ses­sion eas­ily,” he said.</p>
    <p>“But I have told them not to be dis­cour­aged. There are two more games, and we must try our best to win them, and hope for the best.”</p>
    <p>On pa­per, Al­birex have an eas­ier run-in than Tampines. They en­ter­tain bot­tom side Tan­jong Pa­gar United, who are still win­less, be­fore vis­it­ing an Hougang United side de­void of for­eign play­ers.</p>
    <p>But if Lee can gee his play­ers up to per­form like they did in the sec­ond half last night, then they stand a good chance of end­ing their seven-year wait for the league ti­tle.</p>
