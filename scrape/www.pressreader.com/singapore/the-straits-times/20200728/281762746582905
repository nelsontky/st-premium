    <p>HONG KONG • From to­mor­row, Hong Kong will ban gath­er­ings of more than two peo­ple not from the same house­hold, close down restau­rant din­ing and in­tro­duce manda­tory face masks in pub­lic places, as it tries to rein in a new coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>It will be the first time the city has com­pletely banned din­ing in restau­rants.</p>
    <p>“The sit­u­a­tion is very wor­ry­ing,”</p>
    <p>Chief Sec­re­tary Matthew Che­ung said yes­ter­day, adding that the cur­rent out­break is the most se­vere the city has ex­pe­ri­enced.</p>
    <p>The mea­sures will be in place for seven days, he said.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong has seen a spike in lo­cally trans­mit­ted coro­n­avirus cases over the past three weeks, with yes­ter­day the sixth con­sec­u­tive day of triple-digit in­fec­tions. The au­thor­i­ties re­ported 145 cases, a new daily record, of which 142 were lo­cally trans­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>Since late Jan­uary, more than 2,700 peo­ple have been in­fected, 20 of whom have died.</p>
    <p>The ban on din­ing at restau­rants and food out­lets threat­ens to com­pli­cate life for many peo­ple who de­pend on eat­ing out for daily meals as their tiny apart­ments lack kitchen fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The city, with a pop­u­la­tion of more than seven mil­lion, had ear­lier halted dine-in ser­vices from 6pm but al­lowed restau­rants and cafes to func­tion through the day as nor­mal.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have warned that peo­ple have be­come too lax about wear­ing mask and so­cial dis­tanc­ing. Over the week­end, they stepped up con­trols, seal­ing off pop­u­lar beaches and in­tro­duc­ing new rules to limit move­ments of ship and flight crews.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Hos­pi­tal Au­thor­ity says new cases are be­ing found faster than pub­lic hos­pi­tals can take them in, ac­cord­ing to pub­lic broad­caster RTHK.</p>
    <p>China’s li­ai­son of­fice in Hong Kong said on Sun­day that the cen­tral govern­ment will boost the ter­ri­tory’s ca­pac­ity in tests and help set up hos­pi­tals.</p>
