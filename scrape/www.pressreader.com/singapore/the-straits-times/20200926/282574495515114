    <p>For this fam­ily of six, be­ing near the chil­dren’s pa­ter­nal grand­par­ents was the priority when they moved into their Choa Chu Kang Hous­ing Board flat in Novem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>The flex­i­bil­ity of space was also im­por­tant as they wanted to re­con­fig­ure the 1,300 sq ft unit to com­fort­ably house ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>When one steps into their five­room flat, though, it is dif­fi­cult to tell that there are four chil­dren, aged two to 11, liv­ing here.</p>
    <p>Lov­ingly de­signed by home owner T.S. Wong, 42, who runs de­sign firm MOW In­te­rior with busi­ness part­ner and co-founder Sher­maine Ong, the flat feels more like an el­e­gant restau­rant or art gallery.</p>
    <p>The two-month ren­o­va­tion cost about $150,000.</p>
    <p>Stor­age space was key in hid­ing the bric-a-brac that comes with the day-to-day life of a large fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong re­con­fig­ured the kitchen so there would be more space for the main store­room. He also made sure to in­cor­po­rate plenty of cup­board space along the walls and to have it hid­den be­hind con­tin­u­ous pan­elling.</p>
    <p>But rather than blend­ing into the rest of the home, the pan­elling – also known as French mould­ing – is a feature in it­self. Done in the same deep blue as the kitchen cab­i­nets and ac­cented by brass han­dles, the pan­elling adds a dis­tinc­tively clas­sic yet con­tem­po­rary look.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong also did away with the ser­vice yard to make space for both wet and dry kitchens. “Our fam­ily cooks a lot, so we needed to make sure the grease didn’t get into the rest of the house,” he says.</p>
    <p>An es­sen­tial part of the de­sign process was know­ing when to splurge and save. The coun­ters feature an el­e­gant Cala­catta Gold quartz sur­face from Sile­stone’s Eter­nal Col­lec­tion, while some of the home ac­ces­sories, in­clud­ing the ab­stract paint­ing that dom­i­nates the din­ing room, were pur­chased from on­line shop­ping web­site Taobao.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­thing comes to­gether, thanks to Mr Wong’s eye for de­tail. “I wanted ev­ery­thing to be gold, so you can see that the tap, sink and even my wa­ter dis­penser are all gold,” he says with a laugh. Th­ese pop against the neu­trals and deep blue of the home’s pal­ette, lend­ing an el­e­gant touch.</p>
    <p>The at­ten­tion to de­tail con­tin­ues through­out the home.</p>
    <p>The wardrobes i n the mas­ter bed­room feature the same French mould­ing in white, for in­stance, and the switches in the home have the same cham­pagne hue from wiring spe­cial­ist Le­grand’s Galion se­ries.</p>
    <p>The bunting i n the chil­dren’s rooms lends a play­ful touch.</p>
    <p>Th­ese ac­cents were part of the de­sign in­put from Mr Wong’s an­a­lyst wife Sharon and Ms Ong, his busi­ness part­ner who is an in­te­rior de­signer spe­cial­is­ing i n home styling.</p>
    <p>He adds: “We wanted the de­sign to be a fu­sion of both de­sign­ers’ ideas, not just mine.”</p>
