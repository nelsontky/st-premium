    <p>WASH­ING­TON • As the of­ten­quoted line from The Dark Knight (2008) goes: “You ei­ther die a hero or you live long enough to see your­self be­come the vil­lain.”</p>
    <p>Now, a more re­spectable im­mor­tal­ity awaits this Bat­man block­buster from direc­tor Christophe­r Nolan, which earned late ac­tor Heath Ledger a post­hu­mous Academy Award for his per­for­mance as the Joker.</p>
    <p>It is among the mem­o­rable mo­tion pic­tures, along with Shrek (2001), The Joy Luck Club (1993) and Grease (1978), that have been cho­sen for preser­va­tion this year on the United States Li­brary of Congress’ Na­tional Film Reg­istry.</p>
    <p>The li­brary made its an­nual an­nounce­ment yesterday that it has se­lected a new ros­ter of 25 films, from 1913 to 2010, that will be hon­oured for their his­tor­i­cal and cul­tural sig­nif­i­cance and added to this reg­istry, help­ing to pre­serve them for fu­ture gen­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Those se­lec­tions in­clude mile­stone films like Lilies Of The Field, the 1963 drama for which Sid­ney Poitier be­came the first black man to win Best Ac­tor at the Os­cars; and The Hurt Locker, Kathryn Bigelow’s 2008 war drama for which she be­came the first woman to win the Best Direc­tor Os­car.</p>
    <p>This year’s list also in­cludes Kid Auto Races At Venice, the 1914 Key­stone Stu­dios com­edy that was the first re­leased film to fea­ture English comic ac­tor Char­lie Chap­lin play­ing the char­ac­ter of the Lit­tle Tramp.</p>
    <p>Com­mer­cial hits like the an­i­mated Shrek and the mu­si­cal Grease have been cho­sen as well.</p>
    <p>The li­brary noted that this year, it had added nine films di­rected or co-di­rected by women. It said seven films from peo­ple of colour were also se­lected, in­clud­ing Free­dom Rid­ers (2010), Stan­ley Nel­son’s doc­u­men­tary about 1960s civil rights ac­tivism in seg­re­gated Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tional films in­clude Otto Preminger’s drug-ad­dic­tion drama The Man With The Golden Arm (1955), which starred Frank Si­na­tra; A Clock­work Orange (1971), Stan­ley Kubrick’s adap­ta­tion of the dystopian An­thony Burgess novel; and Wayne Wang’s The Joy Luck Club, adapted from the Amy Tan novel.</p>
    <p>The Li­brary of Congress said in a state­ment that th­ese ad­di­tions brought the to­tal num­ber of ti­tles on its preser­va­tion reg­istry to 800.</p>
    <p>Films must be at least 10 years old and “cul­tur­ally, his­tor­i­cally or aes­thet­i­cally sig­nif­i­cant” to be con­sid­ered.</p>
    <p>Nom­i­na­tions can be made by the pub­lic and se­lec­tions are made by Ms Carla Hay­den, the Li­brar­ian of Congress.</p>
