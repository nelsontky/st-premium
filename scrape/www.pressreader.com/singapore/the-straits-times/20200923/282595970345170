    <p>Who will be the next global sen­sa­tion in K-pop?</p>
    <p>It may be hard to pre­dict as the fiercely com­pet­i­tive South Korean music in­dus­try de­buts dozens of boy bands and girl groups an­nu­ally, but Ms Kim Yeon-jeong has a good guess, with data to back it up.</p>
    <p>The head of global K-pop part­ner­ships at so­cial me­dia gi­ant Twit­ter says in a Zoom video call with The Straits Times from Seoul that she has her eye on the eight-piece boy band Stray Kids.</p>
    <p>She says: “They came to Twit­ter Blue­room early in their de­but days and they’ve been back since. They re</p>
    <p>ally love to in­ter­act with their fans.</p>
    <p>“They’ll do ‘men­tion par­ties’ on their own ini­tia­tive and also ques­tion-and-an­swer ses­sions at mid­night (in South Korea), which is smart be­cause that al­lows their ses­sions to have con­tin­ued trac­tion for a longer pe­riod of time with Amer­i­can fol­low­ers wak­ing up to the tweets.”</p>
    <p>Twit­ter Blue­room is a plat­form to host in­ter­views, ques­tion-an­dan­swer ses­sions and per­for­mances, while a men­tion party takes place when a K-pop act replies to as many tweets that men­tion it as pos­si­ble in a spe­cific time frame.</p>
    <p>In data pro­vided by Twit­ter, the group man­aged by JYP En­ter­tain­ment – which de­buted in 2018 af­ter be­ing formed via the re­al­ity show Stray Kids (2017) – topped the list for fastest-ris­ing K-pop artists in the world over the past year. This is ac­cord­ing to the num­ber of men­tions they re­ceived among K-pop acts which de­buted post-2017.</p>
    <p>They were fol­lowed by boy bands</p>
    <p>Ateez, which Ms Kim noted has a large fan base in Amer­ica and Brazil, ac­cord­ing to Twit­ter’s break­down of their fans by ge­og­ra­phy; and Big Hit En­ter­tain­ment’s TXT.</p>
    <p>Ms Kim, who is in her 40s, says the ex­pan­sion and evo­lu­tion of her coun­try’s most fa­mous cul­tural ex­port – its pop music and idol in­dus­try – can be traced through Twit­ter, a hugely pop­u­lar plat­form for the K-pop fan com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>In 2010, go­ing by the num­ber of artist hash­tags and ac­count men­tions, early groups to go in­ter­na­tional like Su­per Ju­nior, Girls’ Gen­er­a­tion and BigBang were the big­gest K-pop acts.</p>
    <p>In 2012, the year of vi­ral hit Gang­nam Style, its singer Psy took the top spot. By 2014, newer groups like GOT7, EXO, Seven­teen and the jug­ger­naut BTS had taken over the charts.</p>
    <p>Ms Kim says BTS were so­cial me­dia savvy from the get-go.</p>
    <p>“They de­buted in 2013, but the BTS Twit­ter ac­count posted for the</p>
    <p>first time in 2012, so they ac­ti­vated on Twit­ter early. They selected Twit­ter as a pri­mary plat­form – an­nounc­ing all their news on Twit­ter and us­ing it to in­crease vis­i­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>“That’s why the BTS Army (the band’s fans) is so strong on Twit­ter be­cause the group has had a long time to build their fan base on it.”</p>
    <p>Look­ing ahead, Ms Kim says Twit­ter is work­ing on trans­la­tion tools.</p>
    <p>A live Blue­room ses­sion yes­ter­day to dis­cuss 10 years of K-pop and Twit­ter – which was mod­er­ated by Ms Kim and fea­tured Ki­hyun and Hyung­won from Mon­sta X, Bang Chan from Stray Kids and Sunmi, pre­vi­ously of Won­der Girls – came with a live trans­la­tion of the ses­sion in the sub­ti­tles.</p>
    <p>As Ms Kim puts it: “While there are no bar­ri­ers to lan­guage in music, I know K-pop can be even big­ger if the lan­guage bar­rier was bro­ken down with swift trans­la­tion of con­tent.”</p>
