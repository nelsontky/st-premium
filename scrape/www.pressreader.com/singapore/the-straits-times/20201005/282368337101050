    <p>At his first press event of the year, Man­dopop king Jay Chou ad­mit­ted to feel­ing a lit­tle ner­vous be­ing in front of so many cam­eras again.</p>
    <p>“Thank god I haven’t been drink­ing that much bub­ble tea re­cently,” the 41-year-old Tai­wanese singer said at a launch for watch­maker Tu­dor’s new Royal col­lec­tion of sport-chic watches in Taipei last Tues­day.</p>
    <p>He said: “You can pho­to­shop your own pub­lic­ity photos but no one does that for you at a press event.”</p>
    <p>Chou, who is a Tu­dor am­bas­sador, put in a 20-minute ap­pear­ance at the event which was broad­cast live to the press in Hong Kong, China and Sin­ga­pore, tak­ing only ques­tions sent in advance.</p>
    <p>The multi-hy­phen­ate, who has di­rected mu­sic videos and his own films like Se­cret (2007), helmed an ad­ver­tise­ment fea­tur­ing him­self for the brand.</p>
    <p>He said: “I’m more ca­sual with my own videos but this is the first time I’m do­ing some­thing like this for an in­ter­na­tional brand so I’m more cau­tious. I want to sat­isfy the client, af­ter all.”</p>
    <p>In the ad­ver­tise­ment, he is seen act­ing out a fight scene and later sit­ting down to play the pi­ano.</p>
    <p>Film­ing it brought back old mem­o­ries. “It re­minded me of days film­ing (2011 Hol­ly­wood ac­tion com­edy) The Green Hor­net. I def­i­nitely tire more eas­ily now, but I shouldn’t be de­feated by old age.”</p>
    <p>Chou, who wore a 41mm Tu­dor Royal watch with a blue dial, said he wants to con­tinue do­ing ac­tion scenes. “I have 20 years left be­fore I’m 60 so I’d bet­ter film fight scenes while I still can,” he said with a laugh.</p>
    <p>On his cri­te­ria for pick­ing out time­pieces, he said: “Firstly, price. I’m prac­ti­cal like that, but also how the watch looks. I like some­thing bright but still el­e­gant, some­thing that goes with ev­ery­thing.”</p>
    <p>Asked how the brand’s slo­gan Born To Dare res­onates with him, he re­flected on his ca­reer, which spans singing, act­ing, di­rect­ing and host­ing.</p>
    <p>“I think you can say I’m a greedy per­son in the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try. I even want to host.</p>
    <p>“Host­ing J-Style Trip (Chou’s Net­flix trav­el­ogue se­ries), for ex­am­ple, is a dar­ing thing for me be­cause it’s a re­al­ity se­ries which goes to so many places in the world where there are lan­guage bar­ri­ers. I could only com­mu­ni­cate with my mu­sic and my magic tricks.”</p>
    <p>Out­side of his travel se­ries, he has some­times posted in English on his In­sta­gram ac­count. Chou, who is mar­ried to Tai­wanese-Aus­tralian model Hannah Quin­li­van and has two chil­dren with her, says: “I’m learning a bit but my wife helps to trans­late my posts too.”</p>
