    <p>The Sin­ga­pore bourse be­gan the week on a dour note, led by a tri­fecta of fac­tors – the pan­demic, the United States elec­tion and cor­po­rate earn­ings sea­son.</p>
    <p>The key Straits Times In­dex (STI) fell 14.08 points, or 0.6 per cent, to 2,523.31 yes­ter­day as Covid-19 cases hit record num­bers in the US and sev­eral Euro­pean coun­tries.</p>
    <p>This week marks the fi­nal stretch be­fore the high-stakes US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion on Nov 3, and the mar­ket fo­cus will also be on the earn­ings sea­son, with tech gi­ants in the US set to re­lease their re­port card.</p>
    <p>Across the re­gion, key gauges in Ja­pan, China, Tai­wan, South Korea, Aus­tralia and Malaysia closed in the red. Hong Kong was closed for hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>“US po­lit­i­cal drama will con­tinue to be the ma­jor mar­ket mov­ing fac­tor for the up­com­ing week and prob­a­bly be­yond,” said FXTM chief mar­ket strate­gist Hus­sein Sayed.</p>
    <p>“So far, bet­ting odds con­tinue to show Bi­den in the lead with a 66 per cent chance of win­ning the elec­tion, ac­cord­ing to RealClearP­ol­i­tics. How­ever, chances of a blue wave have dropped to 50 per cent, sug­gest­ing a more volatile mar­ket re­ac­tion to the re­sult on Nov 3.”</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s muted trad­ing also comes ahead of Brexit’s loom­ing dead­line on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral key mon­e­tary pol­icy meet­ings are in the off­ing in the euro zone, Canada and Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts ex­pect the Euro­pean Cen­tral Bank to pave the way for more stim­u­lus as chal­lenges mount with ris­ing Covid-19 cases, a Brexit trade deal and the ris­ing risk of a dou­ble-dip re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>Many coun­tries will re­port their third-quar­ter gross do­mes­tic prod­uct es­ti­mates. CIMB Pri­vate Bank­ing econ­o­mist Song Seng Wun ex­pects the US, the euro zone, Hong Kong, Tai­wan and South Korea to re­port sharp re­bounds fol­low­ing the col­lapse in the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Over­all trad­ing vol­ume in the lo­cal mar­ket stood at 1.27 bil­lion shares worth $885.60 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Among STI con­stituents, 10 coun­ters were up and 18, down.</p>
    <p>The losses were led by DBS Bank, United Over­seas Bank and OCBC Bank, which col­lec­tively shaved 10.26 in­dex points off the STI.</p>
    <p>Kep­pel Corp fell three cents, or 0.7 per cent, to $4.48. It is set to re­lease its third-quar­ter busi­ness and op­er­a­tional up­dates on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines bucked the gen­eral trend and rose four cents, or 1.12 per cent, to $3.62. Last week, it said it will start three weekly non-stop flights to New York in Novem­ber, amid “early signs of op­ti­mism”.</p>
