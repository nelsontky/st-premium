    <p>More than 400ha of wet­lands, marshes, na­ture parks and eco-cor­ri­dors along the north­ern coast, which in­clude Sungei Bu­loh Wet­land Re­serve, the Kranji Marshes and the up­com­ing Mandai Man­grove and Mud­flat Na­ture Park, have col­lec­tively be­come Sin­ga­pore’s se­cond na­ture park net­work – the Sungei Bu­loh Na­ture Park Net­work.</p>
    <p>More than 400ha of wet­lands, marshes, na­ture parks and eco­cor­ri­dors along the north­ern coast, which in­clude Sungei Bu­loh Wet­land Re­serve, the Kranji Marshes and the up­com­ing Mandai Man­grove and Mud­flat Na­ture Park, have col­lec­tively be­come Sin­ga­pore’s se­cond na­ture park net­work.</p>
    <p>More than thrice the size of the wet­land re­serve, the Sungei Bu­loh Na­ture Park Net­work safe­guards wet­land habi­tats and strength­ens the con­ser­va­tion of wet­land bio­di­ver­sity in the north­ern re­gion.</p>
    <p>It will be com­ple­mented by the Round Is­land Route (RIR), an up­com­ing 150km recre­ational route around Sin­ga­pore that will con­nect var­i­ous green spa­ces through trails and park con­nec­tors. The RIR will be com­pleted pro­gres­sively by 2035.</p>
    <p>The net­work is part of the coun­try’s aim to tran­si­tion from a “city in a gar­den” to “a city in na­ture”. The Na­tional Parks Board (NParks) aims to have at least an ad­di­tional 200ha of na­ture parks by 2030.</p>
    <p>The Sungei Bu­loh Na­ture Park Net­work in­cludes an 18ha coastal na­ture park for­merly re­ferred to as the West­ern Ex­ten­sion. Now named Lim Chu Kang Na­ture Park, it links the wet­land re­serve to the Lim Chu Kang man­groves.</p>
    <p>“The wet­lands have food sources and are im­por­tant nurs­ery grounds for fish and re­fu­elling sites for mi­gra­tory birds. Man­groves are also very im­por­tant in car­bon se­ques­tra­tion and in mit­i­gat­ing coastal ero­sion,” Dr Adrian Loo, group di­rec­tor of con­ser­va­tion at NParks, said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Sur­round­ing na­ture parks act as buf­fers against ur­ban­i­sa­tion, help­ing to con­serve and pro­tect core bio­di­ver­sity ar­eas such as wet­lands and marshes that are filled with in­dige­nous flora and fauna.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, 279 species of birds have been recorded in the 130ha wet­land re­serve and the sur­round­ing habi­tats. Pre­serv­ing these eco­log­i­cally in­ter­de­pen­dent ar­eas in the Sungei Bu­loh Na­ture Park Net­work will en­hance the con­ser­va­tion of these birds.</p>
    <p>Pro­vid­ing green cover, na­ture parks can also serve as habi­tats for wildlife and mi­gra­tory birds.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s first na­ture park net­work is the 2,500ha Cen­tral Na­ture Park Net­work that pro­tects the rain­for­est habi­tats around and within the Bukit Timah and Cen­tral Catch­ment na­ture re­serves.</p>
    <p>There will be more than 15km of na­ture trails within the Sungei Bu­loh Na­ture Park Net­work by 2022, when about 5km of new trails are added to Lim Chu Kang Na­ture Park and Mandai Man­grove and Mud­flat Na­ture Park.</p>
    <p>The Lim Chu Kang Na­ture Park will fea­ture na­ture-in­spired play spa­ces for chil­dren, while her­itage buffs can look for­ward to a new ex­hi­bi­tion gallery in the colo­nial-era Cashin House along the trail.</p>
    <p>Built in 1920 for the Cashin fam­ily, who came from Ire­land, the 100-year-old bun­ga­low cur­rently stands va­cant at the end of a jetty in Lim Chu Kang which was used to trans­port rub­ber be­fore Lim Chu Kang Road was built.</p>
    <p>Cashin House has de­te­ri­o­rated be­yond re­pair and suf­fers from damp­ness due its lo­ca­tion on the edge of the shore.</p>
    <p>The build­ing will be re­con­structed later this year, and is ex­pected to be ready by 2022 to house a vis­i­tor gallery, sem­i­nar rooms for work­shops and a sea-view ter­race.</p>
    <p>The ad­join­ing pier will also be re­con­structed, and the ar­eas sur­round­ing the house will be kept rus­tic and ex­ist­ing veg­e­ta­tion re­tained and sen­si­tively en­hanced, said NParks.</p>
    <p>Separately, NParks is work­ing with the com­mu­nity to plant more than a mil­lion trees across Sin­ga­pore over the next decade, in line with Sin­ga­pore’s “a city in na­ture” vi­sion.</p>
    <p>It aims to ramp up the ex­ist­ing tree-plant­ing ef­forts from 50,000 trees to 100,000 trees an­nu­ally. So far, as part of the move­ment, more than 48,000 trees have been planted is­land­wide.</p>
