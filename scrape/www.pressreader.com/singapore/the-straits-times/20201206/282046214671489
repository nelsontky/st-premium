    <p>The se­cond edi­tion of a high-level fo­rum to pro­mote har­mony and co­he­sion will be or­gan­ised by Sin­ga­pore again in two years, an­nounced Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The next In­ter­na­tional Con­fer­ence on Co­he­sive So­ci­eties (ICCS) will fo­cus on “gath­er­ing best prac­tices and sup­port­ing par­tic­i­pants with the tools and net­works to ad­vance so­cial co­he­sion”, said Madam Hal­imah, who had mooted the idea of the in­ter­faith fo­rum, which was first held here last year.</p>
    <p>“We want to con­tinue us­ing this plat­form to bring to­gether re­li­gious and com­mu­nity lead­ers from around the world, as well as prac­ti­tion­ers and pol­i­cy­mak­ers, to fos­ter dis­cus­sions on build­ing stronger and more co­he­sive so­ci­eties,” she said.</p>
    <p>She added that the in­au­gu­ral con­fer­ence, which was at­tended by al­most 1,000 del­e­gates from nearly 40 coun­tries, had pro­vided op­por­tu­ni­ties for di­verse per­spec­tives to be heard and shared, and the forg­ing of net­works across com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>“Strength from di­ver­sity can only grow from di­a­logue and mu­tual un­der­stand­ing,” said Madam Hal­imah, who was speak­ing to par­tic­i­pants and guests of a hackathon or­gan­ised by the Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth.</p>
    <p>The hackathon is aimed at sup­port­ing com­mu­nity-build­ing projects, and fol­lows the first edi­tion of the ICCS and its Young Lead­ers’ Pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Over 200 par­tic­i­pants worked in teams to pro­pose projects to fos­ter so­cial co­he­sion, and 10 se­lected teams yes­ter­day pre­sented their work to a panel of judges.</p>
    <p>The top three teams were awarded up to $50,000 in grants to im­ple­ment their projects, and the re­main­ing seven will re­ceive up to $30,000 in grants.</p>
    <p>Pro­posed projects in­clude an on­line site to bring to­gether peo­ple of dif­fer­ent com­mu­ni­ties through shared ex­pe­ri­ences like her­itage trails or din­ing ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pant Chwa Wei Jie, 27, said his team will use the grant money to de­velop its project idea, a web­site that would sup­port more in­ter­faith and in­ter­ra­cial col­lab­o­ra­tions in char­ity projects.</p>
    <p>“We hope this can be a bridge for peo­ple of dif­fer­ent faiths to en­gage in mean­ing­ful con­ver­sa­tions and un­der­stand each other,” said Mr Chwa, who joined the hackathon with his col­leagues from The Bi­ble So­ci­ety of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Madam Hal­imah said the hackathon was a timely one, bring­ing youth to­gether and en­cour­ag­ing them to draw from their di­verse so­cial net­works and dif­fer­ent per­spec­tives.</p>
    <p>“Your en­thu­si­asm and creativ­ity give me con­fi­dence that our youth are com­mit­ted to forg­ing a co­he­sive so­ci­ety,” she said.</p>
