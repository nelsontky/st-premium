    <p>LONDON • Arsenal man­ager Mikel Arteta be­lieves that his team are on the “right path” af­ter squeez­ing past Liver­pool 5-4 on penalties on Thurs­day to advance to the League Cup quar­ter-fi­nals af­ter a goal-less 90 minutes.</p>
    <p>With the Premier League cham­pi­ons mak­ing sev­eral changes to the team that beat Arsenal 3-1 in the top flight on Mon­day and their op­po­nents also ro­tat­ing, it was al­ways un­likely to be a high-class en­counter.</p>
    <p>But Arteta was pleased with his side’s ef­forts at An­field.</p>
    <p>“We still have lots to learn but we’re on the right path,” the Spa­niard, just 10 months into the job, said. “It’s the third time in eight weeks we have played against the best team in Europe, in my opinion, and it is a step for­ward for my team.</p>
    <p>“We want to treat ev­ery com­pe­ti­tion as an op­por­tu­nity to win a tro­phy, we have to do that for the club we rep­re­sent and we will do that.”</p>
    <p>Liver­pool had the bet­ter chances and should have been awarded a 44th-minute penalty when Diogo Jota was brought down in the box.</p>
    <p>The re­sult­ing free kick even­tu­ally led to Takumi Mi­namino find­ing space and smash­ing his closerange shot onto the cross­bar.</p>
    <p>Arsenal goal­keeper Bernd Leno made two con­sec­u­tive saves to stop Jota and Marko Gru­jic, and the vis­i­tors re­sponded with a chance of their own as Rob Hold­ing’s header was punched away by Adrian in the 70th minute.</p>
    <p>The Gun­ners also ap­pealed for a penalty in stop­page time when James Milner fell and han­dled the ball in the box.</p>
    <p>Ref­eree Kevin Friend, how­ever, did not point to the spot and there is no video as­sis­tant ref­eree tech­nol­ogy used in the com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>But Arsenal cel­e­brated in the end, pre­vail­ing in the shoot-out when Joe Wil­lock’s spot kick crept un­der Adrian to send them through, af­ter Leno had saved from Divock Origi and Harry Wil­son.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool boss Jur­gen Klopp told Sky Sports: “If there would have been a win­ner in 90 minutes, it should have been us but we are not in dream­land, you have to score.</p>
    <p>“I liked a lot of parts of the game, we mixed it up a lot and I saw a proper per­for­mance, a lot of things we like on the pitch when you wear this won­der­ful shirt.</p>
    <p>“A penalty shoot-out is tricky, ev­ery­one knows.”</p>
