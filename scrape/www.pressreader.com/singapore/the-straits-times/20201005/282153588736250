    <p>Free­lancers in fields like the arts are pleased to fi­nally be get­ting back to work, but the eco­nomic down­turn is putting the squeeze on their usual rates and hurt­ing their pro­fes­sional pride.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic­ity bud­gets have been slashed due to the pan­demic, which has in turn cre­ated a dilemma for those work­ing in the cre­ative area and in Mice (meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­fer­ences and ex­hi­bi­tions) industries.</p>
    <p>Free­lancers say they feel com­pelled to ac­cept lower pay as they need the in­come, but do­ing so could un­der­value the qual­ity of their work and ce­ment low rates as a long-term bench­mark.</p>
    <p>A free­lance ac­tor who wanted to re­main anony­mous said that while low-balling has al­ways been the norm, the mas­sive un­der­cut­ting of rates in re­cent times makes ne­go­ti­a­tion seem­ingly point­less.</p>
    <p>He was re­cently of­fered a role in a video for a tourism ad­ver­tise­ment for just $100, well un­der the prepan­demic fee of $1,500 to $2,000, though rates of­ten de­pend on fac­tors such as how vis­i­ble the ad will be and the du­ra­tion it is shown.</p>
    <p>Though he even­tu­ally re­jected the role as the $100 fee was too low, he has been will­ing to ac­cept rates that are 20 to 30 per cent lower than his usual fee.</p>
    <p>“It’s hard for tal­ent like us to dis­cern be­tween com­pa­nies who gen­uinely have a much lower bud­get for ad­ver­tis­ing and pub­lic­ity, and op­por­tunists who are seiz­ing the moment to ben­e­fit from lower rates,” he said.</p>
    <p>A free­lance writer, who spoke on con­di­tion of anonymity, said she re­cently turned down an In­ter­net mar­ket­ing agency that of­fered $30 for an ar­ti­cle of be­tween 800 and 1,000 words. “(The agency) ex­plained that it’s due to bud­get con­straints, but the max­i­mum they were will­ing to of­fer is $40 per ar­ti­cle,” she said.</p>
    <p>“I’m sure they know it’s low but they should pay fair rates as the work in­volves a fair amount of writ­ing, re­search and im­age sourc­ing.”</p>
    <p>She used to pay her free­lance writers $250 for ar­ti­cles of be­tween 500 and 600 words, al­though she has also worked for publi­ca­tions that paid a flat rate of $100 for ar­ti­cles slightly longer in length.</p>
    <p>“Even though there might be es­tab­lished mar­ket rates, in re­al­ity, many publi­ca­tions set their own rates which writers just have to work with,” she said.</p>
    <p>If the low rates per­sist, she plans to take on a full-time job as free­lanc­ing would no longer be vi­able.</p>
    <p>A free­lance de­signer, who wanted to be known only as Ms Leong, 31, said she has been pro­duc­ing dig­i­tal ban­ners for fees as low as $20 to $30, when she would pre­vi­ously have charged be­tween $80 and $200.</p>
    <p>She noted that busi­nesses are cut­ting costs as they shift to the dig­i­tal realm, and she is will­ing to ac­cept lower rates for the time be­ing just to re­tain her client pool.</p>
    <p>Mr David Leong, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of hu­man re­source firm Peo­ple-World­wide Con­sult­ing, said: “Free­lancers and con­tract work­ers have much weaker bar­gain­ing power in a con­tract-for-ser­vice ar­range­ment, as they are mainly price tak­ers and have lit­tle price com­mand un­less their skills are ex­cep­tional or if sup­ply is lim­ited.”</p>
    <p>He added that their sit­u­a­tion is one of sim­ple sup­ply and de­mand: If the free­lancers choose to main­tain their cur­rent price, “they are hold­ing out with lit­tle hope that the ser­vice buyer will im­prove on the of­fered price, which no union or gov­ern­ment in­ter­ven­tion could help with ne­go­ti­a­tion”, as it re­lies purely on mar­ket de­mand.</p>
    <p>So when a free­lancer re­jects a job, the of­fer will likely go to “some­one who is hun­grier and ready to bite the bul­let”.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong urges free­lancers to take the chance to “build good­will and trust with their cus­tomers, which will likely be re­cip­ro­cated with fu­ture jobs”.</p>
    <p>The ap­proach was echoed by Mr Rudy de Rozario , whose firm Drape Em­pire sets up drapes and back­drops for events.</p>
    <p>“For clients whom I have a longterm work­ing re­la­tion­ship with, I’ll be will­ing to re­duce my prices by up to 30 per cent – some­thing which I call the Covid good­will pack­age – be­cause of the mu­tual trust and un­der­stand­ing we have with one an­other,” said Mr de Rozario, 43.</p>
    <p>A typ­i­cal ball­room drape costs around $2,000 though the price may vary de­pend­ing on cov­er­age.</p>
    <p>But there is a limit to how big a dis­count he can of­fer; he has turned down clients ask­ing for cuts of more than 50 per cent as this would not do justice to the qual­ity of his work.</p>
    <p>Ms Jean See, act­ing di­rec­tor of the Na­tional Trades Union Congress’ Free­lancers and Self-Em­ployed Unit, said: “Busi­nesses will ben­e­fit from hav­ing a re­li­able and cred­i­ble ecosys­tem of sup­pli­ers in­clud­ing free­lance pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>“Hence, it is in their best in­ter­est to en­gage in sus­tain­able business prac­tices so that busi­nesses gain from free­lancers’ ex­per­tise and, in turn, free­lancers find it vi­able to in­vest in build­ing their ca­pa­bil­i­ties and skills.”</p>
    <p>She en­cour­ages free­lancers and ser­vice buy­ers to “have an open dis­cus­sion to come to an agree­ment on ex­pec­ta­tions, fees and con­tract terms be­fore start­ing a project”.</p>
