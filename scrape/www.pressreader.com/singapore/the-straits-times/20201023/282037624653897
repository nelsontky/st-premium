    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s first util­ity-scale En­ergy Stor­age Sys­tem (ESS) has been in­stalled at an SP Wood­lands sub­sta­tion, the En­ergy Mar­ket Au­thor­ity (EMA) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The ca­pac­ity of the ESS is equiv­a­lent to pow­er­ing more than 200 four-room Hous­ing Board (HDB) flats for a day.</p>
    <p>The in­stal­la­tion is part of an ini­tia­tive by the EMA – in col­lab­o­ra­tion with in­dus­try stake­hold­ers, the re­search com­mu­nity and other govern­ment agen­cies – to grow Sin­ga­pore’s so­lar en­ergy ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>In the light of cli­mate change con­cerns, the Re­pub­lic is mov­ing to­wards a clean, af­ford­able and re­li­able en­ergy fu­ture, with so­lar power be­ing the most vi­able re­new­able en­ergy source here, EMA said.</p>
    <p>The util­ity-scale sys­tem will man­age the stor­age of so­lar en­ergy, among other func­tions. It is a re­li­able source of power, due to its quick re­sponse when so­lar in­stal­la­tions are af­fected by cloud cover and rain.</p>
    <p>The sys­tem is be­ing tested in the whole­sale elec­tric­ity mar­ket, mit­i­gat­ing power fluc­tu­a­tions from so­lar en­ergy as well as re­duc­ing peak de­mand.</p>
    <p>Group chief ex­ec­u­tive of SP Group Stan­ley Huang said: “The de­ploy­ment of ESS, de­signed for lo­cal con­di­tions, will en­able us to in­cor­po­rate a greater amount of re­new­ables and other sus­tain­able en­ergy so­lu­tions into our elec­tric­ity grid.”</p>
    <p>The EMA has also worked with the HDB, Sun­seap En­ergy Ven­tures, Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity (NTU) and Pana­sonic Asia Pa­cific to de­ploy dis­trib­uted ESS at elec­tri­cal switch rooms for five HDB blocks in Pung­gol.</p>
    <p>These sys­tems op­er­ate on a smaller scale com­pared with the util­ity-scale ESS.</p>
    <p>By us­ing HDB blocks as test sites, the project looks to solve prob­lems that might arise in fu­ture sys­tems due to in­ter­mit­tent so­lar en­ergy at large-scale in­stal­la­tions.</p>
    <p>EMA’s chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer, Mr Ngiam Shih Chun, said these en­ergy stor­age sys­tems are “crit­i­cal in sup­port­ing Sin­ga­pore’s tar­get of at least two gi­gawatt-peak of so­lar de­ploy­ment by 2030”, as they help in­te­grate more so­lar en­ergy into the power grid.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s first ESS tech­nol­ogy road map was also launched yes­ter­day. Com­mis­sioned by EMA, it was cre­ated by En­ergy Re­search In­sti­tute @ NTU and the Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search to chart the tech­no­log­i­cal trends and eco­nom­ics of the ESS ecosys­tem.</p>
    <p>It can be viewed on­line at go.gov.sg/ess-roadmap-2020</p>
    <p>Com­ple­ment­ing the road map is the Tech­ni­cal Ref­er­ence 77, Sin­ga­pore’s first set of tech­ni­cal guide­lines to ed­u­cate and guide con­sumers on the safe and re­li­able de­ploy­ment of ESS in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
