    <p>A new jobs and skills train­ing ini­tia­tive called Skills Ig­ni­tion SG has been launched by Google in con­junc­tion with gov­ern­ment agen­cies Economic De­vel­op­ment Board, In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity and Skill­sFu­ture Sin­ga­pore, tar­geted at en­try-level and mid-ca­reer work­ers (Google launches jobs and train­ing ini­tia­tive with govt agen­cies, July 21).</p>
    <p>This is on top of the SGUnited Trainee­ships Pro­gramme that aims to sup­port up to 21,000 re­cent and new grad­u­ates and im­prove their em­ploy­a­bil­ity, and the SGUnited Skills Pro­gramme train­ing ini­tia­tive that aims to help trainees ac­quire in­dus­try-rel­e­vant skills.</p>
    <p>The com­mon thread among all th­ese pro­grammes is that there is no guar­an­tee of em­ploy­ment after the end of the pro­gramme from par­tic­i­pat­ing com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>There needs to be some­thing more con­crete. The Gov­ern­ment should con­sider sup­port­ing the set­ting up of worker co­op­er­a­tives, an im­por­tant op­tion when it comes to cre­at­ing jobs.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, such co­op­er­a­tives have shown the abil­ity to main­tain em­ploy­ment dur­ing an economic down­turn. Since work­ers are di­rectly in­volved in the de­ci­sion-mak­ing, co­op­er­a­tives are less likely to cut jobs. They of­fer an economic model based on mu­tual sup­port, fair­ness and sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>In coun­tries such as Spain, Bri­tain, Den­mark, Italy, Ja­pan and Canada, net­works of worker co­op­er­a­tives were started and sus­tained in re­sponse to economic down­turns. In Spain, for ex­am­ple, about 20,000 co­op­er­a­tives were recorded in 2015, em­ploy­ing around 300,000 per­sons, ac­cord­ing to a pub­li­ca­tion by the Euro­pean Net­work of Cities and Re­gions for the So­cial Econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Re­cent mea­sures to con­tain</p>
    <p>Covid-19 have been dev­as­tat­ing for many com­pa­nies. An in­creas­ing num­ber of busi­nesses will have to close down, with the prospect of sig­nif­i­cant un­em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment can im­prove the en­vi­ron­ment for the trans­fer of own­er­ship of such busi­nesses to em­ploy­ees and the trans­for­ma­tion of the busi­nesses into worker co­op­er­a­tives.</p>
    <p>Since work­ers are di­rectly in­volved in the de­ci­sion-mak­ing, co­op­er­a­tives are less likely to cut jobs. They of­fer an economic model based on mu­tual sup­port, fair­ness and sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
