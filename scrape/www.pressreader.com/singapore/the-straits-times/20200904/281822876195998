    <p>Peo­ple in Bri­tain con­tin­ued to grad­u­ally re­turn to their work­places late last month, some­thing Prime Min­is­ter Boris Johnson wants to speed up this month to help the econ­omy re­cover from its his­toric coro­n­avirus slump.</p>
    <p>Fifty-seven per cent of work­ing adults trav­elled to work be­tween Aug 26 and 30, up from 55 per cent two weeks ear­lier and 33 per cent in May, the coun­try’s sta­tis­tics of­fice said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Those work­ing ex­clu­sively from home slipped to 20 per cent from 22 per cent, the Of­fice for Na­tional Sta­tis­tics (ONS) said. That fig­ure stood at nearly 40 per cent in June.</p>
    <p>Mr Johnson has urged more peo­ple to get back to their work­places.</p>
    <p>Last week, one of the coun­try’s busi­ness leaders said big ur­ban centres looked like ghost towns, putting at risk swathes of firms that cater to commuter work­ers.</p>
    <p>The ONS said that foot­fall in re­tail ar­eas hit more than 75 per cent of its level a year ear­lier in the week be­gin­ning on Aug 24, largely driven by peo­ple re­turn­ing to high streets.</p>
    <p>Counts of cars, pedes­tri­ans and cy­clists in Lon­don and the north­east of Eng­land re­turned to around pre-lock­down lev­els.</p>
    <p>But there was a re­minder that Bri­tain is fac­ing higher un­em­ploy­ment as the govern­ment winds down its job re­ten­tion scheme – on­line job ad­ver­tise­ments re­mained around 55 per cent of their 2019 av­er­age for a fourth straight week, the ONS said.</p>
