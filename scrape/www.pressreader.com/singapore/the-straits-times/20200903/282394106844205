    <p>BERN (Switzer­land) • Europe’s na­tional teams will emerge from a 10month hia­tus as the sec­ond edi­tion of the Na­tions League kicks off to­day, still in the shadow of the Covid-19 pan­demic which brought foot­ball to a stand­still this year.</p>
    <p>There has been no in­ter­na­tional ac­tion on the con­ti­nent since last Novem­ber and the in­ter­ven­ing pe­riod has seen the Euro­pean Cham­pi­onship de­layed un­til next June, with club foot­ball the pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>For­mer world cham­pi­ons Ger­many and Spain will meet to­day, when six other games take place. Re­vi­talised Italy wel­come Bos­nia to­mor­row and, on Satur­day, Euro­pean cham­pi­ons and hold­ers Por­tu­gal host Croa­tia, while world cham­pi­ons France visit Swe­den.</p>
    <p>“We will restart with even greater de­ter­mi­na­tion,” said Az­zurri coach Roberto Mancini, whose side had chalked up an Ital­ian record-break­ing 11 suc­ces­sive wins be­fore the in­ter­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter not play­ing for so long, there’s even more de­sire to get back on the pitch.”</p>
    <p>De­spite travel curbs around Europe and a surge in coro­n­avirus cases in some coun­tries, Uefa has con­firmed that all games, bar one, would be played in the orig­i­nally sched­uled venues and prac­ti­cally ev­ery as­so­ci­a­tion will host a game.</p>
    <p>“Most mem­ber as­so­ci­a­tions have man­aged to ob­tain from their com­pe­tent na­tional/lo­cal au­thor­i­ties ex­emp­tions al­low­ing teams to travel to the match venue and their play­ers to re­turn to their clubs af­ter their na­tional team duty,” a state­ment read.</p>
    <p>The only game to be moved was for po­lit­i­cal rea­sons – Moldova’s re­fusal to recog­nise Kosovo as an in­de­pen­dent na­tion means they will host their match in Parma, Italy.</p>
    <p>Matches will still have to be played be­hind closed doors and there are po­ten­tial com­pli­ca­tions if play­ers test pos­i­tive for Covid-19 be­fore matches. Uefa says that matches will go ahead as long as both teams have at least 13 play­ers avail­able. Teams who are not able to field a side could for­feit the match, with the fi­nal de­ci­sion rest­ing with its dis­ci­plinary com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>The Na­tions League, con­cep­tu­alised to re­place friendlies, fea­tures all 55 of Europe’s na­tional teams di­vided into four di­vi­sions – Leagues A to D – that are them­selves split into four groups.</p>
    <p>There is rel­e­ga­tion and pro­mo­tion between each league, al­though un­like the first edi­tion, the groups in Leagues A, B and C have been in­creased from three to four coun­tries so that teams will play six matches in the next two months, in­stead of four.</p>
    <p>The com­pe­ti­tion could also pro­vide a back door to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar as two of the 12 places in the Euro­pean play-offs will be re­served for Na­tions League teams.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, in­ter­na­tional foot­ball in the rest of the world will re­main on hold with this month’s World Cup qual­i­fiers in Asia and South Amer­ica post­poned.</p>
