    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shanmugara­tnam gave his take on sev­eral is­sues during a virtual di­a­logue at the Sin­ga­pore Tech Fo­rum yesterday.</p>
    <p>ECO­NOMIC RE­CON­FIG­U­RA­TION AND CHINA</p>
    <p>Con­trary to what some might think, glob­al­i­sa­tion is not on the de­cline. In­stead, what the global econ­omy is see­ing is a re­con­fig­u­ra­tion as a re­sult of China’s evo­lu­tion, said Mr Thar­man.</p>
    <p>He noted that the big­gest trend was the evo­lu­tion of the Chi­nese econ­omy. “It is get­ting larger. (China is) hav­ing a much larger mid­dle class con­sum­ing a lot more. (They) are hav­ing much more ca­pa­bil­i­ties do­mes­ti­cally, able to pro­duce within China what was pre­vi­ously im­ported, and that might give the im­pres­sion of some wan­ing of glob­al­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>“But ac­tu­ally, it’s the same story – it’s about a coun­try that’s emerg­ing and mov­ing up the global value curve and cre­at­ing more value for it­self and oth­ers,” he said, not­ing that China’s ex­ports are stronger than ever, even amid the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
    <p>The global econ­omy is still the fu­ture, he said, not­ing that big tech com­pa­nies still set up of­fices in dif­fer­ent parts of the world and have teams in­ter­na­tion­ally.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus might have thrown a span­ner in the works for some of these firms in terms of in­ter­na­tional ex­pan­sion, but Mr Thar­man said the pandemic has also ac­cel­er­ated real-time uni­fied global man­age­ment, where com­pa­nies are man­aged not by in­di­vid­ual sites but as a whole.</p>
    <p>This, he added, is pos­si­ble through data flows, which are global and in­stan­ta­neous, mak­ing them ef­fi­cient.</p>
    <p>THE NEED FOR RE­SILIENCE</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has made clear the need for re­silient hubs which in­ter­na­tional com­pa­nies can count on to con­tinue do­ing busi­ness in a sta­ble man­ner, even amid un­prece­dented chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>What com­pa­nies could also be seeking now are hubs – places where they can feel as­sured that de­spite any dis­rup­tions, their busi­nesses will be able to con­tinue, Mr Thar­man said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s aim is to be a multi-faceted hub that cor­po­ra­tions can rely on to steer them through crises like the coro­n­avirus pandemic, he added.</p>
    <p>“Our fu­ture is as a hub – a hub for tal­ent, local and for­eign; a hub that is con­nected to the rest of the world as ef­fi­ciently as pos­si­ble, and where data in par­tic­u­lar flows in and out with­out fric­tion; but also a hub in the new sense that is very im­por­tant, which is about re­silience – pre­dictable, re­li­able, and re­silient.”</p>
    <p>COVID-19 AND BE­LIEF IN THE PUB­LIC GOOD</p>
    <p>An emerg­ing dif­fer­en­tia­tor be­tween coun­tries aris­ing from the pandemic is whether peo­ple be­lieve in civic-mind­ed­ness, or what Mr Thar­man re­ferred to as the “pub­lic good”.</p>
    <p>So­ci­eties such as Sin­ga­pore, South Korea, Hong Kong, Tai­wan and New Zealand have man­aged to bring their in­fec­tion num­bers to low lev­els be­cause their peo­ple re­spect the pub­lic good, the se­nior min­is­ter noted.</p>
    <p>If peo­ple think that wear­ing face masks and re­spect­ing norms to keep Covid-19 at bay are less im­por­tant than their own per­sonal rights, ev­ery­one is going to be worse off in a so­ci­ety, he added.</p>
    <p>“Your chances of suc­cumb­ing to Covid-19 are much greater if peo­ple think it’s just a mat­ter of free choice and in­de­pen­dent in­di­vid­ual pref­er­ences. But if you be­lieve in the pub­lic good, in ev­ery­one play­ing their part, then ev­ery­one is bet­ter off,” he said.</p>
