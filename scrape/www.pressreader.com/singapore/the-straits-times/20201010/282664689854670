    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong vet­eran ac­tor Lau Dan has de­nied that his son, Haw­ick Lau, will be ap­pear­ing in a Chi­nese re­al­ity tele­vi­sion show with his grand­daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>Also an ac­tor, the younger Lau, 45, and Chi­nese ac­tress Yang Mi, 34, di­vorced in 2018 af­ter a fiveyear mar­riage. They have joint cus­tody of their six-year-old daughter.</p>
    <p>The lit­tle girl lives and at­tends school in Hong Kong, where she is be­ing cared for by her father and pa­ter­nal grand­par­ents.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a report in Hong Kong’s Ori­en­tal Daily News on Wed­nes­day, Haw­ick was in­vited to take part in a Chi­nese re­al­ity show fea­tur­ing celebri­ties and their chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Yang was said to have ob­jected strongly, as she did not want her daughter in­volved in show business at such an early age.</p>
    <p>The report was later de­nied by her for­mer hus­band, who is known for act­ing in Chi­nese TV se­ri­als such as Sealed With A Kiss (2011), Ru Yi (2012) and A Clear Mid­sum­mer Night (2013). He and Yang be­came a couple af­ter they starred in Ru Yi.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, Lau Dan, 76, re­it­er­ated his son’s stance while promoting the sit­com Lo And Be­hold.</p>
    <p>He said his whole fam­ily pre­ferred the lit­tle girl to lead a nor­mal life and did not want her to be un­der pub­lic scru­tiny.</p>
    <p>“My grand­daugh­ter has lit­tle in­ter­est in act­ing, al­though she can act on stage with her class­mates in school,” the el­der Lau said.</p>
    <p>He added that his grand­daugh­ter, who is in Pri­mary 1, was very happy to re­turn to school, as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has kept her mostly in­doors.</p>
