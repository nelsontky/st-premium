    <p>• Ja­pan’s Hideki Mat­suyama drilled a 67-foot birdie putt on his last hole to grab a one-stroke lead at the BMW Cham­pi­onship on Thurs­day, a day when only three play­ers man­aged to break par.</p>
    <p>His three-un­der 67 put him one clear of Amer­i­can Tyler Dun­can and two ahead of Canada’s Macken­zie Hughes, as play­ers strug­gled with fast and firm con­di­tions at Olympia Fields Coun­try Club near Chicago.</p>
    <p>“Greens were firm and play­ing re­ally tough,” Mat­suyama said. “There’s some wa­ter holes that you’ve got to avoid, but all in all, I played good and was able to stay out of trou­ble.”</p>
    <p>Trou­ble is ex­actly where many play­ers found them­selves in the sec­ond of three FedExCup Playoffs events, in which they are bat­tling for a place in next week’s Tour Cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>World No. 1 Dustin John­son, fresh off an 11-shot win in the playoffs opener and lead­ing the sea­son­long stand­ings, hit just six fair­ways but still man­aged a 71.</p>
    <p>“I’m happy with the score. I’m right there,” said the two-time BMW cham­pion.</p>
    <p>“If I can get my bad round out of the way today and play three solid ones the next cou­ple days, I’ll be all right.”</p>
    <p>The third-ranked Justin Thomas, sec­ond in the FedExCup stand­ings, and 15-time Ma­jor cham­pion Tiger Woods, who needs a strong fin­ish to make next week’s tour­na­ment, both fin­ished with three straight bo­geys for 73s.</p>
    <p>Asked whether any thought was put into not play­ing the round af­ter ma­jor North Amer­i­can sports like the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion halted play this week to protest racial injustice, Woods, who is half-black, said the de­ci­sion was made to go ahead.</p>
    <p>“I talked to the (PGA Tour) com­mis­sioner and they were on board,” he added.</p>
    <p>“So no, ob­vi­ously there was talk about it be­cause of ob­vi­ously what hap­pened, but we’re all on board, on the same page.”</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, the Tour said it would sup­port any play­ers who de­cide to protest in the wake of the po­lice shoot­ing of African-Amer­i­can Ja­cob Blake in Wis­con­sin last Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Cameron Champ, who is bira­cial, wore one white shoe and one black shoe with mes­sages of sup­port for the Black Lives Mat­ter move­ment dur­ing his open­ing round of 77.</p>
    <p>“I want to show my love,” he said. “Black Lives Mat­ter means all lives mat­ter. Yes, all lives mat­ter, but so do black lives.”</p>
