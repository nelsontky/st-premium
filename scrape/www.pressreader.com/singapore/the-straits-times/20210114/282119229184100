        <p>While I ap­plaud the Gov­ern­ment for its ini­tia­tives to pro­mote dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and for for­mu­lat­ing safe mea­sures amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, it ap­pears there is still a gap when it comes to the avail­abil­ity of fa­cil­i­ties to sup­port those ini­tia­tives.</p>
        <p>I would like to share a re­cent ex­pe­ri­ence to il­lus­trate this.</p>
        <p>In the past week, my home un­der­went ren­o­va­tion as part of the Home Im­prove­ment Pro­gramme (HIP).</p>
        <p>While I ap­pre­ci­ate that a rest-and-work area was set up nearby for us to use as we were not al­lowed to stay in our units amid the ren­o­va­tion works, I am baf­fled that the area did not have an In­ter­net con­nec­tion.</p>
        <p>As most peo­ple are still en­cour­aged to work from home be­cause of the pan­demic, the lack of In­ter­net con­nec­tiv­ity at such work sta­tions is not help­ful.</p>
        <p>I went to the HIP of­fice to in­quire and was told that the ap­pli­ca­tion to Sing­tel for Wi-Fi ser­vices was not ap­proved. The rea­son for this was not men­tioned.</p>
        <p>Then I went around the neigh­bour­hood to look for a place that pro­vides free In­ter­net ac­cess. For­tu­nately, there are a few places, such as hawker cen­tres, which pro­vide free Wi-Fi un­der the Wire­less@SG scheme. There were, how­ever, no power out­lets to be found.</p>
        <p>When I went next to the li­brary, I found that all the work desks were occupied. When I fi­nally found an empty space at a ta­ble where there was some­one else seated, I was told by the se­cu­rity staff that I was not al­lowed to sit there.</p>
        <p>This was de­spite the fact that I had made sure the per­son and I were at least 1m apart and I had my mask on the en­tire time.</p>
        <p>The next day, I went to the com­mu­nity cen­tre. I asked if there was a workspace I could use, with a power out­let that I could con­nect my lap­top to. I was di­rected to a desk with the only us­able power out­let; the rest of the power out­lets were locked.</p>
        <p>On the third day, I made my way to the same desk at the same com­mu­nity cen­tre. But I was told that I could not use that power out­let in case it caused a power trip. I did not un­der­stand how my work lap­top could cause a power trip.</p>
        <p>I then asked po­litely if there was any other space in the com­mu­nity cen­tre with a us­able power out­let, but was told that there was none.</p>
        <p>It is dis­ap­point­ing that while we are mov­ing to­wards be­ing a Smart Na­tion, I en­coun­tered those in­con­ve­niences which could eas­ily have been worked around.</p>
        <p>I urge the rel­e­vant par­ties to look into these is­sues and hope­fully im­prove these fa­cil­i­ties soon.</p>
