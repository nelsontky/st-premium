    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s bud­get of­fice is block­ing Mr Joe Bi­den’s tran­si­tion team from meet­ing key staff to help pre­pare the Pres­i­dent-elect’s first an­nual spend­ing plan, a move that could de­lay ma­jor pro­pos­als.</p>
    <p>The di­rec­tor of the Of­fice of Man­age­ment and Bud­get (OMB), Mr Russ Vought, has ar­gued in­ter­nally that the agency needs to fo­cus on fin­ish­ing new reg­u­la­tions the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion plans to pub­lish be­fore the Pres­i­dent leaves of­fice, ac­cord­ing to sources fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>But ex­perts on the fed­eral bud­get say Mr Vought’s re­fusal to give Mr Bi­den’s team ac­cess to ca­reer OMB of­fi­cials is un­prece­dented and could hurt Mr Bi­den’s ef­forts to roll out big-pic­ture, for­ward­look­ing ideas on every­thing from health­care to climate change and taxes at the start of his four-year term. The ca­reer OMB staff could pro­vide Mr Bi­den’s team with in­for­ma­tion such as cost es­ti­mates and de­tails on ex­ist­ing pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>Mr Vought said in a se­ries of tweets and in a let­ter sent to for­mer se­na­tor Ted Kauf­man, Mr Bi­den’s tran­si­tion leader, that claims his agency has not been co­op­er­a­tive are false.</p>
    <p>“We have pro­vided all in­for­ma­tion re­quested from OMB about on­go­ing pro­grammes,” he wrote in the let­ter dated Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“OMB has fully par­tic­i­pated in ap­pro­pri­ate tran­si­tion ef­forts,” he wrote, in­clud­ing tak­ing 45 meet­ings with Bi­den of­fi­cials “to dis­cuss spe­cific is­sues, op­er­a­tional ques­tions and more”.</p>
    <p>“What we have not done and will not do is use cur­rent OMB staff to write the BTT’s leg­isla­tive pol­icy pro­pos­als to dis­man­tle this ad­min­is­tra­tion’s work,” he added, us­ing an acro­nym for the Bi­den tran­si­tion team.</p>
    <p>“OMB staff are work­ing on this ad­min­is­tra­tion’s poli­cies and will do so un­til this ad­min­is­tra­tion’s fi­nal day in of­fice. Redi­rect­ing staff and re­sources to draft your team’s bud­get pro­pos­als is not an OMB tran­si­tion re­spon­si­bil­ity.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den com­plained on Mon­day that Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials at OMB and the Pen­tagon were ham­per­ing his tran­si­tion, but he did not give de­tails.</p>
    <p>“Right now we just aren’t get­ting all the in­for­ma­tion that we need from the out­go­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion in key na­tional se­cu­rity ar­eas,” Mr</p>
    <p>Bi­den said af­ter a meet­ing with his na­tional se­cu­rity ad­vis­ers and tran­si­tion of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>“It’s noth­ing short, in my view, of ir­re­spon­si­bil­ity.”</p>
    <p>No ad­min­is­tra­tion from ei­ther party has ever pre­vented its suc­ces­sor from meet­ing OMB staff, ac­cord­ing to Mr Wil­liam Hoagland, a for­mer top Repub­li­can Se­nate aide who had worked on bud­get pol­icy and ap­pro­pri­a­tions for more than 25 years.</p>
    <p>“Not hav­ing ac­cess to OMB and pre­par­ing their bud­get will fur­ther de­lay any ac­tions they want to pur­sue. There will be a se­ri­ous de­lay in the in­com­ing Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion’s abil­ity to put for­ward their bud­get,” Mr Hoagland said in an in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>Mr Yo­hannes Abra­ham, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Bi­den tran­si­tion team, said the OMB’s alleged stonewalli­ng has par­tic­u­larly set back the Pres­i­dent-elect’s ef­fort to plan his re­sponse to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In­com­ing pres­i­den­tial ad­min­is­tra­tions typ­i­cally be­gin their bud­get plan­ning well be­fore the in­au­gu­ra­tion on Jan 20, so they could send the doc­u­ment to Congress by the first Mon­day in Fe­bru­ary. But in re­cent years, the sub­mis­sion has of­ten been de­layed.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump sub­mit­ted his first bud­get to Congress about four months af­ter he took of­fice, on May 23, 2017.</p>
    <p>No ad­min­is­tra­tion from ei­ther party has ever pre­vented its suc­ces­sor from meet­ing with</p>
    <p>OMB staff, ac­cord­ing to Mr Wil­liam Hoagland, a for­mer top Repub­li­can Se­nate aide who worked on bud­get pol­icy and ap­pro­pri­a­tions for more than 25 years.</p>
    <p>“Not hav­ing ac­cess to OMB and pre­par­ing their bud­get will fur­ther de­lay any ac­tions they want to pur­sue,” Mr Hoagland said in an in­ter­view.</p>
