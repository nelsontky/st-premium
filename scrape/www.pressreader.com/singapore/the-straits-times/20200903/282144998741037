    <p>There is an ur­gent need to tackle the per­cep­tion of elitism and lack of so­cial mo­bil­ity in Sin­ga­pore de­spite the raft of pro­grammes and schemes to ad­dress the prob­lem, said Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang GRC).</p>
    <p>In her wide-rang­ing maiden speech dur­ing the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day, the Work­ers’ Party (WP) MP said one so­lu­tion to ad­dress this “real dan­ger fac­ing Sin­ga­pore” could be to en­cour­age more un­der­grad­u­ates and pro­fes­sion­als to speak to and men­tor young peo­ple from dis­ad­van­taged back­grounds.</p>
    <p>These men­tors can en­cour­age stu­dents, dis­cuss their con­cerns and guide them through the re­cruit­ment or ap­pli­ca­tion process, said Ms He, a Cam­bridge-ed­u­cated lawyer.</p>
    <p>“When I worked with my univer­sity’s ac­cess schemes to en­cour­age stu­dents from dis­ad­van­taged back­grounds to ap­ply to top uni­ver­si­ties, we found that it was of­ten a lack of be­lief and con­fi­dence that held many of these stu­dents back,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Of­ten, they showed great po­ten­tial, but it would never cross their minds to even put in an ap­pli­ca­tion, as they felt they stood no chance.”</p>
    <p>This per­cep­tion can per­sist even for stu­dents who ap­plied and suc­ceeded, she added.</p>
    <p>She cited the case of a vol­un­teer she had met, who came from an un­der­priv­i­leged back­ground.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter ob­tain­ing a polytech­nic diploma, he was suc­cess­ful in gain­ing a place to read law at one of our lo­cal uni­ver­si­ties and was about to start a train­ing con­tract with a pres­ti­gious firm.</p>
    <p>“When asked if he was a ster­ling ex­am­ple of our mer­i­toc­racy, he replied firmly that he was an ex­am­ple, in­stead, of to­kenism.”</p>
    <p>Ms He said it is a good start that Sin­ga­pore is now recog­nis­ing the lim­its and even the fail­ures of mer­i­toc­racy, sim­i­lar to what is hap­pen­ing in other de­vel­oped economies.</p>
    <p>“We must not let blind re­liance on what mer­i­toc­racy can achieve turn us into a harsh and un­for­giv­ing so­ci­ety where the vul­ner­a­ble are blamed for their plight, for not be­ing hard­work­ing or tal­ented enough to strive for a bet­ter life for them­selves and their fam­i­lies,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms He also spoke on the im­por­tance of sus­tain­abil­ity, adding that this goes be­yond cli­mate change and en­vi­ron­men­tal is­sues. She said Sin­ga­pore must also en­sure it re­mains so­cially, eco­nom­i­cally and de­mo­graph­i­cally sus­tain­able.</p>
    <p>En­vi­ron­men­tal sus­tain­abil­ity does not just mean costs and com­pli­ance, but can also of­fer new op­por­tu­ni­ties for de­vel­op­ing ex­per­tise in sus­tain­able sup­ply chains that can be ex­ported to other economies in the re­gion, she said.</p>
    <p>Green fi­nanc­ing and tech­nol­ogy should be made more ac­ces­si­ble to small and medium-sized en­ter­prises, Ms He said, and aware­ness of green is­sues should be in­stilled in Sin­ga­pore­ans from a young age.</p>
    <p>She also called on the au­thor­i­ties to mea­sure un­paid care and do­mes­tic work to make such work more vis­i­ble and bet­ter un­der­stand if poli­cies aimed at help­ing care­givers are effective.</p>
    <p>“Such an ap­proach im­me­di­ately recog­nises this work as be­ing of tremen­dous value to our so­ci­ety and will be a first step in chang­ing how we think about such work and in un­der­stand­ing the pro­file of these work­ers,” she added.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing bet­ter vis­i­bil­ity and mea­sures of un­paid work also means that it is eas­ier for our poli­cies to pay more at­ten­tion to in­equal­ity.”</p>
    <p>Ms He said one way to do this would be to con­duct time-use sur­veys, which are a key part of na­tional sta­tis­tics sys­tems in Europe and the United States, as well as some regional coun­tries such as South Korea, Aus­tralia, New Zealand and Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore does not cur­rently con­duct such sur­veys, she added.</p>
