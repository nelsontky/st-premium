    <p>BOTANICO</p>
    <p>With the world open­ing up, I of­ten get the urge to es­cape the hus­tle and bus­tle. Since I can’t travel, I’ll head to Botanico, a restau­rant housed in an Art Deco bun­ga­low at the Sin­ga­pore Botanic Gar­dens.</p>
    <p>I have not been to this part of the gar­dens and am charmed by how laid-back it is. Botanico is on level 2 of the house, above the cafe Bee’s Knees.</p>
    <p>The 120-seat restau­rant has an air-con­di­tioned semi-out­door area that is lit up pret­tily at night, and the main din­ing room has the feel of someone’s din­ing room.</p>
    <p>Someone lucky enough to have a very good head chef. Su­jatha Asokan worked at Pollen and Esquina, among other places, be­fore join­ing the 1-Group, which owns Botanico.</p>
    <p>The 29-year-old In­dian-Chi­nese chef has a way of tak­ing the fa­mil­iar flavours of Sin­ga­pore food and show­cas­ing them in sur­pris­ing – and de­li­cious – ways.</p>
    <p>Take, for in­stance, Herbal Chicken ($29). The ac­com­pa­ny­ing cous­cous is cooked with gin­ger-gar­lic paste, which of course makes it taste like chicken rice.</p>
    <p>There is also a sauce made with an­gel­ica, Solomon’s seal and Chi­nese yam, rem­i­nis­cent of herbal chicken. The chef rat­tles off the names of these Chi­nese herbs in flu­ent Man­darin.</p>
    <p>The rice and sauce taste so good I will over­look the fact that it’s chicken breast – the least in­ter­est­ing part of any chicken – on the plate. It is cooked sous vide and isn’t dry. But how about us­ing chicken thighs in­stead?</p>
    <p>Then there is Beef Tongue Tacos ($18), an ap­pe­tiser with baby bok choy serv­ing as the tacos. Beef tongue is brined and cooked sous vide so it is ten­der and vel­vety. You pile a slice of tongue on the bok choy, add a spoon­ful of bangk­wang slaw and eat.</p>
    <p>The yam bean salad is not there just for crunch. It has lay­ers of flavour from baby bok choy pick­led in fish sauce, lime juice, Thai palm su­gar, chilli padi and Ja­panese vine­gar; gin­ger flower; and toasted and ground up Thai fra­grant rice. Sort of like a veg­etable larb.</p>
    <p>Ro­jak ($15) is sim­i­larly com­plex – guava; ba­lon­g­long, a tart, crunchy fruit; green pa­paya; rose ap­ple and kohlrabi are served with shrimp paste foam, gin­ger flower and prawn oil aioli. Ev­ery bite is in­tense and I could eat a bucket of those del­i­cate sago crack­ers that top this salad.</p>
    <p>Two other ap­pe­tis­ers re­ally hit the spot for me.</p>
    <p>One is As­sam Laksa Ce­viche ($17), fea­tur­ing raw cubes of seabass tossed with lemon and lime juices, house­made chilli jam, ex­tra vir­gin olive oil, finely diced jalapeno, shal­lots, co­rian­der and mint. The glass noo­dles un­der the fish is dressed with a tamarind-bela­can sauce that tastes like as­sam laksa gravy, and the dish is topped with shrimp paste ice cream. It is cool, spicy and perky.</p>
    <p>The other is Wing Bean Salad ($15), which boasts ten­der, young wing beans sliced thin, hard­boiled egg and chick­pea tofu dressed with belachan, lemon­grass, shal­lots, gar­lic and gin­ger.</p>
    <p>There is also lime aioli, which I think is overkill. That pow­er­ful dress­ing is more than enough. And I love the shower of crisp, deep-fried ikan bilis on top.</p>
    <p>The rather pro­saic names of chef Su­jatha’s dishes do not be­gin to de­scribe their com­plex­ity, or hint at her skill in us­ing fresh herbs, Chi­nese herbs, spices and Asian condi­ments to great ef­fect.</p>
    <p>And she show­cases all this bounty in gar­dens full of the very botan­i­cals that shine in her food.</p>
