    <p>•</p>
    <p>Af­ter help­ing more than a mil­lion brick-and-mor­tar Chi­nese re­tail­ers mod­ernise their op­er­a­tions, Alibaba has now set its sights on a new tar­get: the coun­try’s out­dated fac­to­ries.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, China’s largest cor­po­ra­tion un­veiled its first smart fac­tory, a se­cret ex­per­i­ment it had been con­duct­ing for three years on the out­skirts of its home town of Hangzhou.</p>
    <p>The three-storey fa­cil­ity known as Xunxi – trans­lated lit­er­ally as “fast rhino” – is the com­pany’s at­tempt at lev­er­ag­ing its con­sumer data and tech­nolo­gies to help the multi-tril­lion-dol­lar man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor im­prove ef­fi­ciency and meet ris­ing con­sumer ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>Alibaba’s path to smart man­u­fac­tur­ing starts with gar­ments, a mar­ket worth 2.2 tril­lion yuan (S$449 bil­lion) in China last year, based on Euromon­i­tor In­ter­na­tional’s es­ti­mates. Alibaba has said that one in four clothes pur­chased in the coun­try was shipped via its e-com­merce plat­forms, grant­ing it ac­cess to an ocean of data that it is now de­ploy­ing to as­sist do­mes­tic gar­ment mak­ers in de­sign and pro­duc­tion plan­ning.</p>
    <p>Alibaba is also cen­tral­is­ing the ma­te­rial pro­cure­ment process to help re­duce costs. Ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI), ro­botic arms as well as many other in-house tech­nolo­gies have also been put into use at the Xunxi fac­tory pro­to­type.</p>
    <p>It usu­ally takes months for ap­parel com­pa­nies to bring a new de­sign from the run­way to stores, but Alibaba claims it is able to cut or­der lead times by 75 per cent with its so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>This would ad­dress the grow­ing de­mand for in­stant grat­i­fi­ca­tion among China’s Gen-Z con­sumers. For in­stance, with the help of AI, de­sign­ers can re­view sim­u­lated ren­der­ing ef­fects on so-called dig­i­tal fab­rics on their com­puter screens, rather than go­ing through a time-con­sum­ing process of dye­ing the fab­ric.</p>
    <p>Gar­ment work­ers at the fac­tory have high-tech as­sis­tants, such as AI-en­abled cut­ting ma­chines and In­ter­net-con­nected sewing de­vices that help fine-tune their work.</p>
    <p>Once a step has been com­pleted, the item will be trans­ferred to the next work sta­tion via a con­veyor belt.</p>
    <p>Since the en­tire work­flow is recorded dig­i­tally, fac­tory man­agers no longer have to stay on site. In­stead, they can track the progress re­motely on com­put­ers or through their mo­bile phones.</p>
    <p>The data and tech­nol­ogy de­ployed at the Xunxi fac­tory mean mer­chants, which typ­i­cally need at least 90 days to get their goods ready for the store­front, can de­cide what items to make and the scale of the pro­duc­tion over the course of two weeks, re­duc­ing the need to ac­cu­mu­late in­ven­tory.</p>
    <p>Its ul­ti­mate goal, ac­cord­ing to Alibaba, is to be­come a one-stop pro­duc­tion so­lu­tion provider for gar­ment mer­chants on its Taobao and Tmall mar­ket­places.</p>
