    <p>A so­lar in­dus­try re­cruit­ment drive yes­ter­day saw more than 200 res­i­dents sign up for jobs, with agen­cies here an­nounc­ing plans to build skills and ex­pe­ri­ence for Sin­ga­pore­ans to man­age so­lar projects in their en­tire cy­cle, from in­stal­la­tion to main­te­nance.</p>
    <p>This is to meet the Repub­lic’s grow­ing re­new­able en­ergy needs as it strives to achieve 2 giga watt­peak by 2030, al­most five times the cur­rent so­lar us­age.</p>
    <p>Be­tween 3,000 and 4,000 jobs will be cre­ated in the so­lar in­dus­try in the next two to three years, said Mr Gil­bert Tan, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the labour move­ment’s Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute (e2i) and as­sis­tant di­rec­tor-gen­eral of the National Trades Union Con­gress (NTUC).</p>
    <p>To build up the skilled work­force for the in­dus­try, e2i and the Sus­tain­able En­ergy As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (Seas) signed two mem­o­ran­dums of un­der­stand­ing (MOUs) with nine so­lar com­pa­nies and two train­ing providers. NTUC sec­re­tary-gen­eral Ng Chee Meng wit­nessed the sign­ing.</p>
    <p>The agree­ments are aimed at tack­ling man­power chal­lenges and build­ing up skills, train­ing and job prospects for the so­lar in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The MOUs will also see a ca­reer plan de­vel­oped for so­lar tech­nol­o­gists, to en­sure well-de­fined pro­gres­sion in skills, job roles, wages and pro­duc­tiv­ity for the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Of the 430 avail­able jobs at the re­cruit­ment drive, held at the Sin­ga­pore Sus­tain­abil­ity Academy in City Square Mall, 405 va­can­cies were for so­lar tech­nol­o­gists.</p>
    <p>A so­lar tech­nol­o­gist, who would</p>
    <p>have a di­ploma, Nitec or Higher Nitec qual­i­fi­ca­tion, will be in­volved in in­stalling and main­tain­ing so­lar pho­to­voltaic (PV) sys­tems.</p>
    <p>With a di­ploma or de­gree with rel­e­vant ex­pe­ri­ence, a se­nior so­lar tech­nol­o­gist will progress to de­sign­ing PV sys­tems and per­form­ing data anal­y­sis.</p>
    <p>A prin­ci­pal so­lar tech­nol­o­gist will have the re­spon­si­bil­ity of as­sess­ing the fea­si­bil­ity of PV in­stal­la­tions, as well as plan­ning, ex­e­cut­ing and man­ag­ing projects.</p>
    <p>A per­son in this role would have at least eight years of rel­e­vant ex­pe­ri­ence, re­gard­less of whether he has a di­ploma, de­gree or higher Nitec qual­i­fi­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Frank Phuan, chief ex­ec­u­tive and co-founder of lo­cal so­lar en­ergy firm Sun­seap Group, a sig­na­tory of the MOU, said the so­lar in­dus­try has been heav­ily re­liant on for­eign work­ers un­der the con­struc­tion sec­tor to in­stall so­lar pan­els.</p>
    <p>How­ever, that means their job is tran­sient in na­ture, said Mr Phuan, who is also vice-chair­man of Seas.</p>
    <p>“They (the work­ers) will leave some­how, some day. So there’s hardly any ca­reer de­vel­op­ment we can talk about,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Steven Lau was among those who signed up for a job at the re­cruit­ment drive.</p>
    <p>The 33-year old, who works part­time in a lo­gis­tics com­pany, has a de­gree in elec­tri­cal and elec­tron­ics en­gi­neer­ing from Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>He said the so­lar in­dus­try was what he pic­tured him­self be­ing in­volved in when he grad­u­ated four years ago.</p>
    <p>“I hope to se­cure a role (as a so­lar tech­nol­o­gist) by the end of the year, although the time­line is tight.”</p>
