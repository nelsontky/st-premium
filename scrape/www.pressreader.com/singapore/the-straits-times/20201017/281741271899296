    <p>For the first time since March 12, there are fewer than 100 ac­tive coro­n­avirus cases in Sin­ga­pore, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said last night.</p>
    <p>It added that 30 pa­tients re­main in hospital, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 59 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. Th­ese add up to 89 ac­tive cases as of yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>There were nine new coro­n­avirus cases re­ported yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,901.</p>
    <p>None of them were pa­tients in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Of the new cases, eight were im­ported, com­pris­ing two Sin­ga­pore­ans, four work per­mit hold­ers and two short-term visit pass hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Both Sin­ga­pore­ans and two work per­mit hold­ers re­turned from the Philip­pines. One work per­mit holder and one short-term visit pass holder re­turned from In­done­sia. The re­main­ing short-term visit pass holder and work per­mit holder re­turned from In­dia and Myan­mar, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>All the i mported cases were placed on stay-home no­tices upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, said MOH.</p>
    <p>The last new case yes­ter­day was a migrant worker who was tested as part of the ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of work­ers in dor­mi­to­ries. He was asymp­to­matic when tested.</p>
    <p>The clus­ter at The Jovell con­struc­tion site in Up­per Changi has been closed as there have been no new cases linked to it for 28 days, or two in­cu­ba­tion pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of fewer than one case per day in the past two weeks. The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has de­creased from an av­er­age of fewer than one case per day to no cases over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>More than 450,000 con­tact-trac­ing de­vices will also be is­sued to all migrant and lo­cal work­ers liv­ing or work­ing in dor­mi­to­ries here, as well as those in the con­struc­tion, ma­rine ship­yard and process sec­tors, by the Gov­ern­ment and in­dus­try part­ners.</p>
    <p>The dis­tri­bu­tion of the de­vices will start to­mor­row, and is ex­pected to be com­pleted by early next month.</p>
