    <p>When Madam Lim Ee Chin saw black smoke bil­low­ing out from the front door of the Hous­ing Board flat next to hers, the 81-year-old’s first thought was not of her own safety but that of her neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>Madam Lim im­me­di­ately filled a pail with wa­ter in her bathroom, dragged it across her liv­ing room floor to her front gate and passed it to her fran­tic neigh­bour, who had run out of his house to seek help in putting out the fire.</p>
    <p>“Of course I had to help. When I saw their house burn­ing, it hurt my heart. They didn’t set the fire on pur­pose. What if they have no house to live in?” said Madam Lim, in Man­darin, when The Straits Times vis­ited her last night.</p>
    <p>On the night of Aug 9, Madam Lim had been watch­ing tele­vi­sion in the liv­ing room of her 12th­storey flat in Block 917 Jurong West Street 91 when she saw the smoke and heard her neigh­bour’s cry for help.</p>
    <p>For her brav­ery, she re­ceived the Com­mu­nity First Re­spon­der Award on Aug 27, the Singapore Civil De­fence Force (SCDF) said in a Face­book post yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Madam Lim is the old­est re­cip­i­ent of the award, which is pre­sented to mem­bers of the pub­lic who have stepped for­ward to ren­der as­sis­tance to oth­ers in dis­tress or to save prop­erty or both.</p>
    <p>“My other worry was whether the fire would get big­ger be­fore the fire­fight­ers came, but thank­fully it didn’t,” she said.</p>
    <p>Madam Lim, who has a curved spine and heart is­sues, could not re­call how many pails of wa­ter she fetched that night, but “it felt like an hour that would never end”.</p>
    <p>Her 68-year-old sis­ter, who lives in the same flat, called the SCDF. Both women are not mar­ried.</p>
    <p>The flames were al­most out by the time SCDF per­son­nel ar­rived on the scene.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the SCDF left, Madam Lim spent the next two hours – well past mid­night – mop­ping up the wet liv­ing room floor of her flat.</p>
    <p>It was a mem­o­rable Na­tional Day, joked Madam Lim.</p>
    <p>Said the SCDF: “De­spite her age, she did not hes­i­tate to help put out the fire.</p>
    <p>“Her self­less act as­sisted in mit­i­gat­ing the dam­ages and in­juries caused by the fire.”</p>
    <p>Two other neigh­bours also helped in ex­tin­guish­ing the fire but the SCDF said they did not wish to be named and de­clined the award.</p>
    <p>The fire in­volved con­tents of the liv­ing room, said the SCDF.</p>
    <p>In its af­ter­math, three peo­ple were taken to Singapore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>SCDF com­mended Madam Lim for her self­less­ness, not­ing that the in­stinct for many peo­ple would be to get away from the fire in­stead of ren­der­ing help like she did.</p>
    <p>“Madam Lim’s ac­tion ex­em­pli­fied brav­ery and, in her own words, the kam­pung spirit”, SCDF added.</p>
    <p>On re­ceiv­ing the award, Madam Lim said she only re­luc­tantly ac­cepted it as she does not view her ac­tions as “any­thing spe­cial” but “it’s what neigh­bours do”.</p>
    <p>Of I course had to help. When I saw their house burn­ing, it hurt my heart. They didn’t set the fire on pur­pose. What if they have no house to live in?</p>
    <p>MADAM LIM EE CHIN, on why she did not hes­i­tate to help her neigh­bour put out the fire in his flat.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Madam Lim Ee Chin may be 81 years old and have heart is&#xAD;sues. But in&#xAD;stead of flee&#xAD;ing to safety when a fire broke out in her neigh&#xAD;bour&#x2019;s Jurong West Hous&#xAD;ing Board flat on Na&#xAD;tional Day on Aug 9, she rushed to help him. For her brav&#xAD;ery, the Singapore Civil De&#xAD;fence Force hon&#xAD;oured Madam Lim with the Com&#xAD;mu&#xAD;nity First Re&#xAD;spon&#xAD;der Award.
