    <p>Gal­lerist Helina Chan has seen bet­ter days. Her gallery in Orchard, iPre­ci­a­tion, which deals in mod­ern and con­tem­po­rary Asian art, has been quiet amid the global pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In more nor­mal times, art lovers – many of them col­lec­tors from other parts of Asia – would stroll in, pull out a chair and sit down with Ms Chan and her staff to find out more about the art­works and their artists. These days, foot­fall is down by about 80 per cent.</p>
    <p>“The way we usu­ally do busi­ness is per­son-to-per­son, but this model is not work­ing any­more,” Ms Chan says, not­ing that the gallery will do more to en­gage younger col­lec­tors via plat­forms such as so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>“Rent in Sin­ga­pore is very high. I still be­lieve you need a phys­i­cal pres­ence, a phys­i­cal space. But do we need such a big space when peo­ple’s be­hav­iours have changed? We need to relook our busi­ness model.”</p>
    <p>In July, iPre­ci­a­tion launched an on­line show­case of paint­ings by Sin­ga­pore ink mas­ter Zhuang Sheng­tao. Some col­lec­tors made ap­point­ments to view the art in per­son and bought pieces in the $6,000 to $9,000 range. This did not re­ally help the bot­tom line, says Ms Chan.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has hit gal­leries hard. Fairs have been can­celled or post­poned, over­seas col­lec­tors can­not travel, and buyers are more cau­tious. Of the 15 gal­leries The Straits Times spoke to, most say busi­ness has not re­turned to pre-pan­demic lev­els, with vary­ing de­grees of loss in rev­enue.</p>
    <p>At Tan­glin Shop­ping Cen­tre, some gal­leries have had a rough cou­ple of months. Gnani Arts low­ered its shut­ters and moved to 55 Gent­ing Lane this month. Hai Hui Art Gallery, whose busi­ness has fallen by at least half, cut its oper­at­ing hours to just two to three days a week. Kwan Hua Art Gallery, whose cus­tomers are largely for­eign­ers, has seen its busi­ness plum­met by at least 90 per cent. It will re­lo­cate to a smaller unit in the same build­ing at the end of next month.</p>
    <p>“Our art gallery has been es­tab­lished for 25 years,” says Kwan Hua gal­lerist Sandy Tan, “but this is the first time that busi­ness has been dis­mal for an ex­tended pe­riod of time.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, the Gov­ern­ment in­tro­duced a raft of mea­sures to help arts groups tide through the pan­demic. Among them are the Ca­pa­bil­ity Devel­op­ment Scheme for the Arts, as well as a Dig­i­tal Pre­sen­ta­tion Grant (DPG) for the Arts to sup­port the ef­forts of artists and arts groups to go dig­i­tal.</p>
    <p>Yeo Work­shop is one of a dozen gal­leries to have re­ceived the DPG so far. It mounted a solo show by lo­cal artist Wong Lip Chin, with paint­ings, a recorded per­for­mance and an in­ter­ac­tive vir­tual ex­hi­bi­tion in the form of a video game.</p>
    <p>“We were very slow to the dig­i­tal game,” ad­mits Yeo Work­shop’s Ms Au­drey Yeo. “A lot of our sales were done in per­son and we al­ways</p>
    <p>We were very slow to the dig­i­tal game. A lot of our sales were done in per­son and we al­ways were events-based, in­stal­la­tions-based, and peo­ple had to come in to ex­pe­ri­ence it.</p>
    <p>MS AU­DREY YEO of Yeo Work­shop, which has since re­vamped its web­site , up­dated its so­cial me­dia pro­file and hired staff to fo­cus on dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing</p>
    <p>What I find in­ter­est­ing is that peo­ple are look­ing in­wards and look­ing at lo­cal artists, in­stead of think­ing ‘for­eign is best’.</p>
    <p>MR RICHARD KOH of Richard Koh Fine Art, who ob­serves a sim­i­lar trend in his Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok gal­leries</p>
    <p>were events-based, in­stal­la­tions-based, so peo­ple had to come into ex­pe­ri­ence it.”</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the pan­demic, the gallery’s strat­egy changed. It re­vamped its web­site, up­dated its so­cial me­dia pro­file and hired a full­timer and two free­lancers to fo­cus on dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing. It also now has ac­tive deal­ings with dig­i­tal plat­forms Artsy and The Artling.</p>
    <p>Ms Yeo adds: “More peo­ple are dis­cov­er­ing us on­line, but I won­der if that trans­lates into them walk­ing into the gallery, which then trans­lates into sales.”</p>
    <p>Yeo Work­shop is one of many gal­leries that have beefed up their on­line pres­ence. While some are scep­ti­cal about how ef­fec­tive an on­line ex­hi­bi­tion can be, those who have mounted such shows – which typ­i­cally fea­ture im­ages of art­works on a web­site, or a 360de­gree view – tend to see them as merely a com­ple­ment to phys­i­cal ones. Ul­ti­mately, noth­ing beats see­ing a work of art in per­son.</p>
    <p>“The great­est hap­pi­ness for a dealer is when some­one walks into his phys­i­cal space,” says Ga­jah Gallery founder Jas­deep Sandhu, who has launched sev­eral dig­i­tal ex­hi­bi­tions.</p>
    <p>Some gal­leries which have sold art on­line find that col­lec­tors usu­ally go for artists they are fa­mil­iar with, or art­works at a lower price range.</p>
    <p>This was the case for Gnani Arts co-founder P. Gnana, who re­cently re­vamped his web­site and in­tro­duced a new on­line pay­ment gate­way. He also no­ticed that some col­lec­tors ex­pect big­ger dis­counts these days. “We will check with the artist. We have to be very care­ful, we can’t bring down the artist’s im­age and pro­file,” he adds.</p>
    <p>RE­DIS­COVER LO­CAL ART</p>
    <p>Amid the pan­demic, there are sil­ver lin­ings. A few gal­leries have no­ticed more in­ter­est from lo­cal col­lec­tors who, un­able to travel, are look­ing home­ward.</p>
    <p>Richard Koh Fine Art’s re­cent A Decade Apart/To­gether ex­hi­bi­tion, fea­tur­ing Sin­ga­pore artists born in the 1980s and 1990s, saw “tremen­dous sup­port from the Sin­ga­pore com­mu­nity – we al­most sold out”, says founder Richard Koh. Works sold were gen­er­ally priced un­der $4,000. “What I find in­ter­est­ing is that peo­ple are look­ing in­wards and look­ing at lo­cal artists, in­stead of think­ing ‘for­eign is best’,” says Mr Koh, who ob­serves a sim­i­lar trend in his Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok gal­leries. His busi­ness is still down by about 60 per cent.</p>
    <p>With Sin­ga­pore’s push for do­mes­tic tourism, some gal­leries are see­ing a more di­verse crowd.</p>
    <p>At Kam­pong Glam, gallery Coda Cul­ture says re­cent ex­hi­bi­tion sales have out­done ex­pec­ta­tions. Founder See­lan Palay says around half of the works by young painter Faris Heizer, whose de­but solo show is on­go­ing, have been sold. These are priced from $900 to $1,400.</p>
    <p>He adds: “You don’t ex­pect peo­ple to fo­cus on art at this point, but I guess it’s also ther­a­peu­tic.”</p>
    <p>Art Porters Gallery, housed in a shop­house in Spot­tis­woode Park Road, is see­ing more do­mes­tic tourists on week­ends.</p>
    <p>Co-founder Guil­laume LevyLam­bert says: “Some peo­ple are look­ing more at art as an in­vest­ment. Art is some­thing tan­gi­ble. If you put your money in the stock mar­ket it is a bit ab­stract.”</p>
    <p>The gallery is ex­pand­ing the price range of its works. It will in­tro­duce more af­ford­able pieces, but also sell more ex­pen­sive mas­ter works from sec­ondary mar­kets to cater to would-be in­vestors.</p>
    <p>Levy-Lam­bert, who will soon launch an ex­hi­bi­tion on art in­for­ma­tion web­site Mu­tu­alArt, be­lieves art lovers will con­tinue to buy art that speaks to them. He said that a fort­night be­fore the cir­cuit breaker, an ex­pa­tri­ate cou­ple walked into his gallery and told him they had lost most of their life sav­ings in the stock mar­ket crash.</p>
    <p>“They said, ‘ We woke up this morn­ing and we de­cided to not be de­pressed. We’re go­ing to buy art.’”</p>
    <p>They left with two art­works – one of Levy-Lam­bert’s, priced at $2,400, and an­other by young artist Priyageeth­a Dia, priced at less than $1,000.</p>
    <p>From Nov 20 to 22, Art Porters Gallery will join about 20 gal­leries for an SG Gallery Week­end, or­gan­ised by the Art Gal­leries As­so­ci­a­tion Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Art fairs are a way for gal­lerists to reach out to new col­lec­tors, but not ev­ery­one is upset that many have been can­celled or post­poned. “We’ve been on this carousel for so many years – it’s good to take a breather,” says Mr Koh, whose gallery spends US$50,000 (S$68,800) to US$100,000 a fair. Be­fore Covid-19, they had al­ready at­tended fewer art fairs – down from about eight a year to five, as they had found it in­creas­ingly hard to meet new col­lec­tors that way.</p>
    <p>The Af­ford­able Art Fair is go­ing dig­i­tal. Ut­terly Art is one of 50 gal­leries from around the world that will take part in the Af­ford­able On­line Art Fair from Nov 4 to 30. Works at the fair cost no more than £6,000 (S$10,600) each.</p>
    <p>Col­lec­tors may be more cau­tious these days, but many are still will­ing to col­lect good art if they see it.</p>
    <p>Prom­i­nent Sin­ga­pore collector Jack­son See, 60, is keep­ing an eye out for young lo­cal artists re­spond­ing to the pan­demic in their work.</p>
    <p>“If the artist can think out­side the box and do some­thing re­lated to Covid-19, it would be very in­ter­est­ing,” he says. “This is his­tory (in the mak­ing). The im­pact is so heavy and it af­fects ev­ery­one. In 20, 30 years, we’ll look back and re­flect on what the sit­u­a­tion was like in the world.”</p>
    <p>With so much un­cer­tainty over how long the pan­demic will last, gal­leries hope col­lec­tors will con­tinue to sup­port them.</p>
    <p>Kwan Hua Art Gallery’s Ms Tan says: “For those who en­joy art and have been for­tu­nate to not be badly im­pacted by the pan­demic, I hope they can con­tinue to show sup­port for lo­cal art gal­leries. It would be a sad day if lo­cal art gal­leries put up their shut­ters be­cause of the pan­demic.”</p>
