    <p>A law could be passed in Sin­ga­pore that could al­lay busi­ness con­cerns about li­a­bil­ity is­sues from the do­na­tion of un­sold food, The Straits Times has learnt.</p>
    <p>Mr Louis Ng, an MP for Nee Soon GRC and chair­man of the Gov­ern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee on Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment, plans to ta­ble the Good Sa­mar­i­tan Food Do­na­tion Act through a Pri­vate Mem­ber’s Bill.</p>
    <p>Food waste is a ma­jor waste stream, he said, and chan­nelling food still safe for con­sump­tion to ben­e­fi­cia­ries is a win-win sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“It helps on both the en­vi­ron­men­tal and so­cial fronts,” he said.</p>
    <p>Fig­ures from the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) show that Sin­ga­pore gen­er­ated 744,000 tonnes of food waste last year.</p>
    <p>“We es­ti­mate that about 40 per cent of the food waste gen­er­ated in Sin­ga­pore is from com­mer­cial and in­dus­trial premises such as food man­u­fac­tur­ers, cater­ers, sup­pli­ers and whole­salers,” said an NEA spokesman.</p>
    <p>Asked why food waste was an is­sue he de­cided to raise, Mr Ng re­counted his ex­pe­ri­ence at a buf­fet line with his fam­ily last year.</p>
    <p>A staff mem­ber had brought a cake out when re­plen­ish­ing the dessert plat­ter near clos­ing time, only to later throw al­most the en­tire cake away – just one slice had been taken – after the line was closed.</p>
    <p>“It was a huge waste,” Mr Ng said. “The ex­cess food could have been chan­nelled to ben­e­fi­cia­ries.”</p>
    <p>He has also come across food busi­nesses, such as bak­eries, that throw out un­sold food at the end of the day. He cited a con­cern over do­na­tion raised by one: “The food do­nated may be safe for con­sump­tion, but it is harder to de­ter­mine when the ben­e­fi­cia­ries will con­sume the food or how they store it.”</p>
    <p>The Good Sa­mar­i­tan law that Mr Ng hopes to raise will be his sec­ond Pri­vate Mem­ber’s Bill.</p>
    <p>The first, which pro­posed changes to an ex­ist­ing law to bet­ter pro­tect na­tive wildlife, was passed as the Wildlife Act in Par­lia­ment in March.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng said he has set up a com­mit­tee with mem­bers from su­per­mar­kets, ho­tels, restau­rants and char­i­ties. The first meet­ing was held last week and a se­ries of pub­lic con­sul­ta­tions will be launched soon.</p>
    <p>But it may take some time be­fore the leg­is­la­tion can be raised in Par­lia­ment due to the com­plex­ity of is­sues in­volved, he said. The first Bill took al­most three years of work.</p>
    <p>Li­a­bil­ity con­cerns were also raised by food busi­nesses dur­ing NEA’s en­gage­ment with them, said the agency’s spokesman.</p>
    <p>Guide­lines on the proper han­dling and re­dis­tri­bu­tion of un­sold and ex­cess food to ad­dress food safety con­cerns has since been incorporat­ed in Food Waste Min­imi­sa­tion Guide­books, which are avail­able online.</p>
    <p>A Sin­ga­pore Food Agency (SFA) spokesman said that in con­sid­er­ing the fea­si­bil­ity of Good Sa­mar­i­tan laws, there is a need to strike a bal­ance be­tween fa­cil­i­tat­ing food do­na­tion, and en­sur­ing that food donors and food dis­trib­u­tors ex­er­cise due care and prac­tise good hy­giene when dis­tribut­ing do­nated food.</p>
    <p>“SFA will work with Mr Ng to ex­plore the in­tro­duc­tion of Good Sa­mar­i­tan laws in Sin­ga­pore, to ease busi­ness con­cerns... and min­imise food wastage,” she said.</p>
    <p>NEA noted that a work group com­pris­ing gov­ern­ment agen­cies</p>
    <p>744,000</p>
    <p>The amount of food waste in tonnes that Sin­ga­pore gen­er­ated last year, ac­cord­ing to fig­ures from the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency. and char­i­ties was also con­vened by the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment last year to en­hance food co­or­di­na­tion and min­imise food waste.</p>
    <p>“Some key is­sues that the work group is study­ing in­clude us­ing data and dig­i­tal so­lu­tions to co­or­di­nate food sup­port in Sin­ga­pore, and to en­sure do­nated food meets the needs of the ben­e­fi­cia­ries,” said the NEA spokesman.</p>
