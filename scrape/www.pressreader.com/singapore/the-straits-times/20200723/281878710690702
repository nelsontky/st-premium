    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tain re­mains com­mit­ted to agree­ing the out­lines of a bal­anced trade agree­ment with the Euro­pean Union, but sig­nif­i­cant dif­fer­ences be­tween the two sides re­main, a spokesman for Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son said yesterday.</p>
    <p>Talks on a so-called fu­ture re­la­tion­ship, which are now in their fifth round, have all but stalled, rais­ing fears among some com­pa­nies that there will be dis­rup­tion at the end of the year if the two sides fail to se­cure a trade deal.</p>
    <p>“We re­main com­mit­ted to work­ing hard to find the out­lines of a bal­anced agree­ment,” the spokesman told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“Our pref­er­ence is to leave with an FTA (free trade agree­ment) as long as it guar­an­tees our po­lit­i­cal and economic in­de­pen­dence... We will make sure that we’re pre­pared for all pos­si­ble sce­nar­ios.”</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, The Tele­graph re­ported that Bri­tain and the EU will fail to sign a post-Brexit trade deal, with only a few days left be­fore Mr John­son’s July deadline.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish gov­ern­ment’s as­sump­tion is that there will not be a deal, though it re­mains pos­si­ble that a “ba­sic” agree­ment could be reached if the EU gives ground in the au­tumn, the news­pa­per said, cit­ing gov­ern­ment sources.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment ex­pects it will trade with Europe on World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion terms when the tran­si­tion pe­riod ends, the re­port added.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain left the EU on Jan 31, and its re­la­tion­ship with the bloc is now gov­erned by a tran­si­tion ar­range­ment that keeps pre­vi­ous rules in place while the two sides ne­go­ti­ate new terms.</p>
    <p>Ne­go­tia­tors re­main dead­locked on fish­ing rights, the deal’s gov­er­nance, the Euro­pean Court of Jus­tice’s role and so-called level play­ing field guar­an­tees, the news­pa­per re­ported.</p>
    <p>Yesterday, Mr John­son also said Bri­tain did not vote to leave the EU in 2016 be­cause of any pres­sure from Rus­sia, after a re­port said the gov­ern­ment had failed to in­ves­ti­gate whether Moscow had med­dled in the ref­er­en­dum.</p>
