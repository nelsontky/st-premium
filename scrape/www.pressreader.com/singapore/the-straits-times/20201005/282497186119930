    <p>LONDON • Spit­ting Im­age, the ground-break­ing Bri­tish satir­i­cal tele­vi­sion show that used grotesque pup­pets to skewer politi­cians and pub­lic fig­ures, re­turned last Satur­day af­ter a 24-year break – with Mr Boris J ohn­son and Mr Don­ald Trump in its sights.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter and United States Pres­i­dent are among 100 char­ac­ters i mmor­talised in foam la­tex for a new se­ries for stream­ing ser­vice BritBox, along­side Face­book chief ex­ec­u­tive Mark Zucker­berg, re­al­ity TV star Kim Kar­dashian and Bri­tain’s Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle.</p>
    <p>In its 1980s hey­day, Spit­ting Im­age’s silly and of­ten crass sketches brought pol­i­tics to a mass au­di­ence and pro­vided an out­let for anger against the right-wing re­forms of then Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Mar­garet Thatcher as well as then US Pres­i­dent Ron­ald Rea­gan.</p>
    <p>The show ran from 1984 to 1996 and drew in 15 mil­lion view­ers a week at its peak.</p>
    <p>Co-cu­ra­tor Roger Law said it was a “good time” to bring it back as the so­cial up­heaval of that time “is not dis­sim­i­lar with what’s go­ing on now”, cit­ing di­vi­sions in Bri­tain over Brexit.</p>
    <p>The new pro­gramme pulls no punches against Mr Trump, who is shown in the first episode try­ing to make a deal with an ac­tual coro­n­avirus and then asleep as his snake­like ex­tended anus writes an­gry tweets.</p>
    <p>The show – which will be writ­ten and aired weekly to keep it top­i­cal – had to be hastily up­dated af­ter Mr Trump last week con­tracted Covid-19 and por­trays him com­plain­ing about be­ing quar­an­tined with his wife Me­la­nia.</p>
    <p>Closer to home, PM John­son is shown as a bum­bling idiot con­trolled by his chief ad­viser Do­minic Cum­mings, an alien over­lord with a throb­bing head.</p>
    <p>In other scenes, Prince Harry searches in vain for a job in Los An­ge­les, while Dis­ney ex­ec­u­tives dis­cuss whether to cre­ate a “black Yoda” in re­sponse to de­mands for racial justice.</p>
    <p>Lead writer Jeff West­brook, of The Simp­sons (1989 to present) and Fu­tu­rama (1999 to 2013) fame, said he hoped view­ers would see the new se­ries as “satire, rather than cru­elty”.</p>
    <p>“I don’t set out to re­ally of­fend peo­ple,” he said at a pre­view, adding that the show was “a lit­tle bit whim­si­cal and silly”.</p>
    <p>PM John­son said he was not averse to his rub­ber dou­ble, adopt­ing the same tack as pre­vi­ous politi­cians who claimed to like their pup­pets.</p>
    <p>“I saw a big poster and I have to say I thought he looked con­sid­er­ably bet­ter than me,” he told ITV News.</p>
    <p>“But I think they’ve been too kind, they need to go back to the draw­ing board and have an­other go. It’s far too flat­ter­ing in my gen­eral view.”</p>
