    <p>• The ar­chae­o­log­i­cal crypt of Notre-Dame re­opens to­day with an ex­hi­bi­tion re­trac­ing the cathe­dral’s tur­bu­lent his­tory, nearly 18 months af­ter it was rav­aged by fire.</p>
    <p>The blaze i n April l ast year top­pled the cathe­dral’s spire and de­stroyed much of the roof of what is one of France’s most cher­ished na­tional trea­sures.</p>
    <p>The crypt, sit­u­ated below the square in front of the cathe­dral and con­tain­ing the re­mains of for­ti­fi­ca­tions and ther­mal baths, had to be cleaned of lead dust – an ar­du­ous job that took more than a year be­fore visi­tors could be al­lowed back in.</p>
    <p>The ex­hi­bi­tion pays homage to French writer Vic­tor Hugo and ar­chi­tect Eu­gene Vi­ol­let-le-Duc, the two men be­hind the res­ur­rec­tion of the cathe­dral in the 19th cen­tury.</p>
    <p>FOR­BID­DING AND DAN­GER­OUS</p>
    <p>Hugo’s novel The Hunch­back Of Notre-Dame, pub­lished in 1831, was in­stru­men­tal in win­ning pub­lic back­ing for the restora­tion of the mon­u­ment, which had been left in a state of aban­don and de­cay.</p>
    <p>“The ex­hi­bi­tion starts with how the cathe­dral looked at the time the novel was pub­lished,” said Mr Vin­cent Gille, a cu­ra­tor at the Vic­tor Hugo mu­seum in Paris.</p>
    <p>“It was a fright­fully for­bid­ding and dan­ger­ous build­ing which bore no re­sem­blance to a ra­di­ant and shin­ing cathe­dral,” he added, point­ing to sev­eral of Hugo’s sketches as ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>The ex­hi­bi­tion con­sists mostly of pho­to­graphs, draw­ings, paint­ings and film ex­cerpts il­lus­trat­ing the world’s fas­ci­na­tion with the cathe­dral, from its his­tor­i­cal be­gin­nings to mod­ern-day an­i­mated fea­ture films.</p>
    <p>WAR AGAINST THE DE­MOL­ISH­ERS</p>
    <p>Notre-Dame was badly dam­aged by van­dal­ism in the early 19th cen­tury. In­dif­fer­ent city au­thor­i­ties were plan­ning to tear it down when Hugo called for “war against the de­mol­ish­ers” in a pam­phlet pub­lished in 1825.</p>
    <p>“There is per­haps not a sin­gle city in France to­day that is not think­ing about, be­gin­ning or com­plet­ing the de­struc­tion of some na­tional mon­u­ment,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the pub­li­ca­tion of Hugo’s novel, the ex­hi­bi­tion shows, the French pub­lic swung be­hind the idea that Notre-Dame was worth sav­ing. It gave cru­cial sup­port to Vi­ol­let-le-Duc’s work on the cathe­dral be­tween 1844 and 1864, which laid the foun­da­tions of the na­tional­mon­u­ment sta­tus it en­joys to­day.</p>
    <p>The in­spi­ra­tion for some of the cathe­dral’s fea­tures, such as the malev­o­lent chimeras over­look­ing Paris, came di­rectly from Hugo’s novel – which had also, eerily, de­scribed a dev­as­tat­ing fire.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers see the ex­hi­bi­tion as the first step to­wards a re­turn to nor­mal for the crypt’s mu­seum, which be­fore the fire wel­comed some 170,000 visi­tors a year.</p>
    <p>“The pro­ject started very soon af­ter the fire and was mo­ti­vated by the wish to hon­our the cathe­dral,” cu­ra­tor Anne de Mon­denard said.</p>
    <p>Work on Notre-Dame’s re­con­struc­tion af­ter last year’s fire has been plagued by de­lays due to bad weather, con­cerns over lead pol­lu­tion and, most re­cently, the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It was only in early June that work­ers be­gan the del­i­cate task of re­mov­ing tonnes of metal scaf­fold­ing that had melted to­gether in the fire – ren­o­va­tion work had been un­der way when the blaze struck.</p>
    <p>French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron gave his bless­ing in July to a faith­ful re­con­struc­tion of the cathe­dral’s spire, in a change of heart af­ter pre­vi­ously call­ing for a “con­tem­po­rary” touch.</p>
