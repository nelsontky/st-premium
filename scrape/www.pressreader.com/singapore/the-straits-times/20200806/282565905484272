    <p>For decades, the chef has been cast as the star at the cen­tre of the kitchen.</p>
    <p>In the same way the au­teur the­ory in film frames the di­rec­tor as the au­thor of a movie’s cre­ative vi­sion, the chef has been con­sid­ered en­tirely re­spon­si­ble for the res­tau­rant’s suc­cess. Ev­ery­one else – line cooks, servers, dish­wash­ers, even din­ers – is back­ground, there to sup­port that vi­sion.</p>
    <p>This way of think­ing has in­formed the in­dus­try’s cul­ture at ev­ery level. But the power of the chef-au­teur as an idea is fad­ing, and as res­tau­rant work­ers or­gan­ise and speak up about abu­sive work­places, toxic bosses and in­equities in pay and ben­e­fits, it is clear the res­tau­rant in­dus­try has to change.</p>
    <p>The el­e­va­tion of the chef to front and cen­tre is rel­a­tively new. Un­til about 40 years ago, chefs were con­sid­ered unglam­orous, trolls of the stove, hid­den be­hind the kitchen’s swing­ing doors.</p>
    <p>With a few ex­cep­tions, they were not thought of as artists or vi­sion­ar­ies. They could not gen­er­ally as­pire to mag­a­zine cov­ers or amass de­voted, cult-like in­ter­na­tional fol­low­ings. They did not get book deals, dis­cuss their in­spi­ra­tions in in­ter­views, star in doc­u­men­taries or hire pub­li­cists to make hor­rific scan­dals dis­ap­pear.</p>
    <p>As chefs inched to­wards au­teur­ship, they were fi­nally recog­nised for gru­elling, pre­vi­ously un­der­val­ued labour. They were also given more room to reimagine dishes and menus, to tinker with how res­tau­rants worked and who they were for. They made res­tau­rants an in­fin­itely more ex­cit­ing place to dine and work.</p>
    <p>Kitchen Con­fi­den­tial, by the late celebrity chef Anthony Bour­dain, was also canon. Through­out his ca­reer, Bour­dain called for at­ten­tion and re­spect for im­mi­grants, work­ers who were in the coun­try il­le­gally and the many un­der­paid, over­looked roles es­sen­tial to a res­tau­rant.</p>
    <p>But he was also a celebrity who up­held a ro­man­tic ideal of a chef’s work as the kind of bru­tal, im­pos­si­bly de­mand­ing, but ul­ti­mately mean­ing­ful work that ex­alted mis­fits, draw­ing them to­gether with a sense of pur­pose – at least, for the du­ra­tion of din­ner ser­vice.</p>
    <p>This com­pli­cated, shared un­der­stand­ing of res­tau­rant kitchens was of­ten used to jus­tify the work, the hours and the un­rea­son­able ex­pec­ta­tions in ser­vice of ex­cel­lence and glory. It ex­plained away the gross, sys­temic de­fi­cien­cies of the busi­ness and nor­malised abu­sive work cul­tures.</p>
    <p>As chefs built big res­tau­rant busi­nesses, of­ten re­ferred to as em­pires, they be­came pow­er­ful brands, ca­pa­ble of ob­scur­ing abuse, as­sault and dis­crim­i­na­tion. And if they con­tin­ued to make money for in­vestors, they of­ten main­tained their power – as in the case of Mario Batali.</p>
    <p>Batali be­came one of the United States’ most high-pro­file chefs and res­tau­ra­teurs, open­ing pop­u­lar res­tau­rants, host­ing shows on ABC and the Food Net­work, pub­lish­ing a se­ries of pop­u­lar cook­books and play­ing a cen­tral role in Bill Bu­ford’s vivid book Heat, pub­lished in 2007.</p>
    <p>But in 2017, sev­eral women spoke up about Batali’s pat­tern of sex­ual ha­rass­ment and as­sault. It was not un­til last year that he di­vested his shares in the Bas­tianich & Batali Hos­pi­tal­ity Group and stopped prof­it­ing from the res­tau­rants he had es­tab­lished.</p>
    <p>In the same way, chef April Bloom­field sev­ered her part­ner­ship with restau­ra­teur Ken Fried­man in 2018 af­ter he was ac­cused of sex­ual ha­rass­ment. She con­ceded in an in­ter­view that she had not done enough to end the abuse.</p>
    <p>The i dea of a chef-au­teur is tena­cious and sly – it lim­its the nar­ra­tive and it sus­tains it­self.</p>
    <p>Look at the ho­mo­gene­ity among ma­jor in­dus­try best-of lists from or­gan­i­sa­tions such as the James Beard Foun­da­tion, Miche­lin and the World’s 50 Best Res­tau­rants.</p>
    <p>White male chefs who al­ready fit neatly into the stereo­type of the au­teur are over-rep­re­sented, praised for a highly spe­cific ap­proach to fine din­ing, then re­warded with more in­vest­ment and op­por­tu­ni­ties to repli­cate that same ap­proach.</p>
    <p>So many al­ter­na­tive kinds of food busi­nesses are never con­sid­ered for awards or in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>They do not fit into the chefau­teur frame­work, and in some cases have no de­sire to do so – com­mu­nity farms with food stalls, rov­ing trucks or fam­ily res­tau­rants where three dif­fer­ent cooks take turns in the kitchen, de­pend­ing on their child­care sched­ules.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has ex­posed the fragility and in­equity of the res­tau­rant in­dus­try, dis­pro­por­tion­ately af­fect­ing black peo­ple, peo­ple of colour, res­tau­rant work­ers and those who keep the food chain run­ning in US fac­to­ries and farms.</p>
    <p>Bol­stered by the power of the #MeToo and Black Lives Mat­ter move­ments, work­ers are speak­ing up. The model for the in­dus­try, as it ex­ists now, has to change.</p>
    <p>Menus are col­lab­o­ra­tive, to some de­gree or an­other. Chefs lead that work, per­haps as­sign­ing tests, ap­prov­ing new dishes or tasting them, edit­ing them and in most cases mak­ing the fi­nal de­ci­sions that shape the way the food comes to the ta­ble. But in some cases, dozens of other cooks could be in­volved in the process.</p>
    <p>Res­tau­rants are the work of teams, kitchens full of cooks and dish­wash­ers co­or­di­nat­ing with din­ing rooms full of servers, run­ners and bar­tenders.</p>
    <p>Each role, each day, plays a part in a res­tau­rant’s suc­cess.</p>
