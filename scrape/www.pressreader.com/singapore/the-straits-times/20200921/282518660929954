    <p>NEW YORK • “How’s your den­tal prac­tice?” a friend of mine asked, con­cern ev­i­dent on her face.</p>
    <p>Since the on­set of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, with a city­wide shut­down in New York and so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures firmly en­trenched, more than a hand­ful of friends and fam­ily mem­bers have pre­sumed I must be on the brink of clos­ing. But I let her know that I am busier than ever.</p>
    <p>“I’ve seen more tooth frac­tures in the last six weeks than in the pre­vi­ous six years,” I ex­plained.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, that is no ex­ag­ger­a­tion.</p>
    <p>One ob­vi­ous an­swer is stress and it is no secret that pan­demic-re­lated anx­i­ety is af­fect­ing our col­lec­tive men­tal health. That stress, in turn, leads to clench­ing and grind­ing, which can dam­age the teeth.</p>
    <p>But more specif­i­cally, the surge I am see­ing in tooth trauma may be a re­sult of two ad­di­tional fac­tors.</p>
    <p>First, an un­prece­dented num­ber of Amer­i­cans are sud­denly work­ing from home, of­ten wher­ever they can cob­ble to­gether a makeshift work­sta­tion.</p>
    <p>The awk­ward body po­si­tions that en­sue can cause us to hunch our shoul­ders for­ward, curv­ing the spine into some­thing re­sem­bling a C-shape.</p>
    <p>If you are won­der­ing why a den­tist cares about er­gonomics, the sim­ple truth is that poor pos­ture dur­ing the day can trans­late into a grind­ing prob­lem at night.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, most of us are not get­ting the restora­tive sleep we need.</p>
    <p>Since the on­set of the pan­demic, I have lis­tened to pa­tient af­ter pa­tient de­scribe sud­den rest­less­ness and in­som­nia. Th­ese are hall­marks of an over­ac­tive or dom­i­nant sym­pa­thetic ner­vous sys­tem, which drives the body’s “fight or flight” re­sponse.</p>
    <p>Think of a glad­i­a­tor pre­par­ing for bat­tle: balling his fists, clench­ing his jaw. Be­cause of the stress of coro­n­avirus, the body stays in a bat­tle-ready state of arousal, in­stead of rest­ing and recharg­ing. All that ten­sion goes straight to the teeth.</p>
    <p>So what can we do?</p>
    <p>You would be sur­prised how many peo­ple are un­aware that they are clench­ing and grind­ing. Even pa­tients who come into the of­fice com­plain­ing of pain and sen­si­tiv­ity are of­ten in­cred­u­lous when I point it out.</p>
    <p>Aware­ness is key. Are your teeth cur­rently touch­ing? Even as you read this ar­ti­cle? If so, that is a sure sign that you are do­ing some dam­age – your teeth should not ac­tu­ally touch through­out the day at all un­less you are ac­tively eat­ing and chew­ing your food.</p>
    <p>In­stead, your jaw should be re­laxed, with a bit of space be­tween the teeth when the lips are closed. Be mind­ful and try to stop your­self from grind­ing when you catch your­self do­ing it. If you have a night guard or re­tainer – de­vices that keep the teeth in proper align­ment and pre­vent grind­ing – try pop­ping them in dur­ing the day. Th­ese pro­vide a phys­i­cal bar­rier, ab­sorb­ing and dis­pers­ing pres­sure.</p>
    <p>And since many of us will be con­tin­u­ing to work from home for months, it is im­per­a­tive to set up a proper work­sta­tion.</p>
    <p>Ide­ally, when seated, your shoul­ders should be over your hips and your ears should be over your shoul­ders. Com­puter screens should be at eye level; prop up your mon­i­tor or lap­top on a box or a stack of books if you do not have an ad­justable chair or desk.</p>
    <p>At the end of the work­day, I ad­vise my pa­tients to – ex­cuse the very tech­ni­cal, med­i­cal term here – “wig­gle like a fish”.</p>
    <p>Lie down on the floor on your back, with your arms ex­tended straight above your head and gen­tly wig­gle your arms, shoul­ders, hips and feet from side to side.</p>
    <p>The goal is to de­com­press and elon­gate the spine, as well as re­lease and re­lieve some of that ten­sion and pres­sure.</p>
    <p>Then, right be­fore bed, take five min­utes to quiet your mind. The more re­laxed your body, the more likely you are to wake up with less ten­sion in the jaw. That means less grind­ing at night.</p>
