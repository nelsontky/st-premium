    <p>Bri­tain has un­veiled its pri­or­ity list of re­cip­i­ents as the first phase of mass vac­ci­na­tion is rolled out this week. These are other coun­tries that have come up with their own pri­or­ity lists:</p>
    <p>JA­PAN</p>
    <p>Ja­pan has said it will give its el­derly pri­or­ity ac­cess to the coro­n­avirus vac­cine, but not ex­pec­tant moth­ers. The gov­ern­ment has cited the lack of con­clu­sive ev­i­dence in­di­cat­ing the in­creased vul­ner­a­bil­ity of preg­nant women to the dis­ease. The vac­cines will be dis­trib­uted free of charge once they be­come avail­able in the first half of next year.</p>
    <p>A more detailed list is yet to be fi­nalised but so far, these are the peo­ple who will get it first, in the fol­low­ing or­der:</p>
    <p>1. Health­care workers</p>
    <p>2. The el­derly</p>
    <p>3. Peo­ple with pre-ex­ist­ing con­di­tions</p>
    <p>4. Gen­eral pub­lic</p>
    <p>IN­DONE­SIA</p>
    <p>In­done­sia will pri­ori­tise its work­ing pop­u­la­tion aged be­tween 18 and 59 for vac­ci­na­tion. It plans to de­liver the first jabs early in Jan­uary us­ing a two-pronged ap­proach. Those who pay will fall un­der the Mandiri scheme and re­ceive vac­cines of their choice on a first­come-first-served ba­sis. Oth­ers will re­ceive theirs for free, with pri­or­ity given to:</p>
    <p>1. Med­i­cal workers, po­lice, mil­i­tary of­fi­cers and Sat­pol PP (Pub­lic Or­der Of­fi­cers)</p>
    <p>2. Res­i­dents in the red zone of Java, the most pop­u­lous is­land which has high in­fec­tion rates</p>
    <p>MALAYSIA</p>
    <p>Malaysia has said it will fo­cus on in­oc­u­lat­ing adults only, as the ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cines have yet to be tested on chil­dren un­der the age of 12. It has se­cured at least 12.8 mil­lion doses so far, enough to im­mu­nise 6.4 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>With its first vac­cine ship­ment ex­pected to ar­rive in the first quar­ter of next year, the gov­ern­ment’s spe­cial com­mit­tee on vac­cine sup­ply ac­cess has di­vided pri­or­ity re­cip­i­ents broadly into three groups: 1. Front-line workers such as staff of the health min­istry, po­lice, the armed forces, im­mi­gra­tion of­fi­cers 2. High-risk groups such as in­di­vid­u­als with more than one se­ri­ous health con­di­tion and se­nior cit­i­zens</p>
    <p>3. Other adults</p>
    <p>IN­DIA</p>
    <p>In­dia has set a rel­a­tively lower age thresh­old – 50 years – for pri­or­ity ac­cess. Ac­cord­ing to the Times of In­dia, the vac­cines will be given to the fol­low­ing peo­ple first, in de­scend­ing or­der:</p>
    <p>1. Health­care workers</p>
    <p>2. Front-line workers in­clud­ing po­lice, the armed forces and mu­nic­i­pal workers</p>
    <p>3. Peo­ple aged above 50</p>
    <p>4. Peo­ple aged be­low 50 with se­vere co-mor­bid con­di­tions and those re­quir­ing spe­cial care</p>
    <p>THE UNITED STATES</p>
    <p>The Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine could be in use in the US as early as Fri­day, once the Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion gives its clear­ance for emer­gency use.</p>
    <p>Three groups of peo­ple will be first in line, in the fol­low­ing or­der: * 1a. Health­care per­son­nel; res­i­dents and staff of long-term care fa­cil­i­ties such as nurs­ing homes</p>
    <p>* 1b. Es­sen­tial workers, e.g. school staff, po­lice, gro­cery workers and bus driv­ers</p>
    <p>* 1c. Peo­ple aged 65 and older; adults with un­der­ly­ing med­i­cal con­di­tions that put them at higher risk of se­vere Covid-19</p>
    <p>(* to be voted on by the Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol)</p>
    <p>SWITZER­LAND</p>
    <p>Switzer­land is pre­par­ing to start mass vac­ci­na­tion next month. Up to 70,000 per day are planned.</p>
    <p>Its fed­eral of­fice of pub­lic health said pri­or­ity ac­cess will be given in this or­der:</p>
    <p>1. In­di­vid­u­als who are at a high risk of de­vel­op­ing se­ri­ous symp­toms from coro­n­avirus</p>
    <p>2. Health­care pro­fes­sion­als and staff car­ing for in­di­vid­u­als at es­pe­cially high risk</p>
    <p>3. Close con­tacts such as house­hold mem­bers of in­di­vid­u­als at es­pe­cially high risk</p>
    <p>4. Res­i­dents of var­i­ous ages in com­mu­nal fa­cil­i­ties vul­ner­a­ble to out­breaks</p>
    <p>5. Other adults</p>
