    <p>Did you re­ceive an e-mail or text mes­sage from Net­flix ask­ing you to up­date your pay­ment de­tails? Do not click on it – it is most likely a phish­ing scam, as the stream­ing gi­ant does not ask for credit card or bank ac­count de­tails via e-mails and text mes­sages.</p>
    <p>With more peo­ple turn­ing to pop­u­lar on­line ser­vices such as Net­flix while they stay at home amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, scam­mers have been tar­get­ing these users, lead­ing to a spike in non-bank­ingre­lated phish­ing scams this year.</p>
    <p>Po­lice told The Straits Times that 238 non-bank­ing-re­lated phish­ing scams were reported be­tween Jan­uary and June, a huge jump from the seven reported in the same pe­riod last year. There are likely to have been more of such scams since June.</p>
    <p>In the first half of this year, the amount of money lost to such scams was about $268,000, which is 67 times the $4,000 lost dur­ing the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Be­sides im­per­son­at­ing Net­flix staff, scam­mers also sent phish­ing e-mails pre­tend­ing to be from SingPost, StarHub and Pay­Pal, as more peo­ple turn to dig­i­tal op­tions to do ev­ery­thing from re­mote work to shop­ping and en­ter­tain­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Stephan Neumeier, manag­ing di­rec­tor for Asia-Pa­cific at cy­ber-se­cu­rity firm Kasper­sky, told The Straits Times: “Cy­ber crim­i­nals are tak­ing ad­van­tage of this seis­mic shift in dig­i­tal habits to launch so­cial en­gi­neer­ing at­tacks such as phish­ing e-mails. By in­clud­ing hot top­ics and phrases re­lated to their on­line ac­tiv­i­ties like shop­ping and stream­ing en­ter­tain­ment in their mes­sages, the chances of an un­sus­pect­ing user click­ing in­fected links or ma­li­cious at­tach­ments in­crease tremen­dously.”</p>
    <p>Phish­ing scams work through con­vinc­ing im­per­son­ations that trick vic­tims into giv­ing sen­si­tive bank­ing de­tails and pass­words.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Cy­ber Se­cu­rity Agency of Sin­ga­pore (CSA) ad­vised mem­bers of the pub­lic to stay vig­i­lant and be wary of e-mails or text mes­sages that use “ur­gent lan­guage”, such as threats of be­ing logged out of their ac­counts if they do not up­date their ac­count de­tails or pay­ment in­for­ma­tion promptly, or of­fers that may sound too good to be true.</p>
    <p>Users should not re­spond to such re­quests or click on any un­known links, or pro­vide their per­sonal de­tails, fi­nan­cial in­for­ma­tion or pass­words, if they are un­sure of the au­then­tic­ity of the re­quest, added the CSA.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, the po­lice warned in an ad­vi­sory that as year-end on­line shop­ping events ap­proach, mem­bers of the pub­lic may be ex­posed to more phish­ing scams as fake on­line of­fers be­come more wide­spread.</p>
