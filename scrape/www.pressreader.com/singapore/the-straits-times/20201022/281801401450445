    <p>The ex­u­ber­ance was pal­pa­ble as the crowd gath­ered at Bangkok’s Democ­racy Mon­u­ment un­der a dark­en­ing sky.</p>
    <p>Form­ing hu­man chains, they care­fully re­moved hun­dreds of pot­ted plants in­side the traf­fic cir­cle – adorn­ment that made it look more like a me­dieval French gar­den than a tow­er­ing re­minder of the day in 1932 when the king was forced to give up ab­so­lute power. The pro­test­ers said they wanted to re­claim the mon­u­ment for the peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Along the same Ratchadam­noen Av­enue, some 2km away, hun­dreds of peo­ple dressed in yel­low sat out­side the Grand Palace, wait­ing to re­ceive King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn. His mo­tor­cade ar­rived some two hours later.</p>
    <p>“We are noth­ing but dust com­pared with His Majesty,” said 62-year-old Su­patip Rakquant, who had pre­pared sand­wiches to be dis­trib­uted to other roy­al­ists.</p>
    <p>The events on that Wed­nes­day – Oct 14 – would mark a turn­ing point in Thai­land’s months-long prodemoc­racy move­ment.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers who had taken a de­tour to avoid block­ing a royal con­voy un­ex­pect­edly en­coun­tered one bear­ing Queen Suthida and Prince Di­pangkorn Ras­mi­joti.</p>
    <p>Some jeered. The gov­ern­ment de­clared a state of “se­ri­ous emer­gency” in Bangkok and then turned on the wa­ter can­non dur­ing a down­town rally last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>On the same day, the King ap­peared on state tele­vi­sion speak­ing to for­mer com­mu­nists, say­ing the coun­try needed peo­ple who loved the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery day since then, de­fi­ant young pro­test­ers have surged back onto the streets. Some of them in­sulted the King pub­licly de­spite laws that for­bid this.</p>
    <p>Four­teen-year-old school­girls roared into loud­hail­ers, call­ing for Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha to step down, the mil­i­tary-backed Con­sti­tu­tion to be changed and the monar­chy to be re­formed.</p>
    <p>Now, law­mak­ers are try­ing to con­vene an ex­tra­or­di­nary par­lia­men­tary ses­sion to avert a spi­ralling cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Po­lice on Mon­day searched a pub­lish­ing house, tak­ing away some books re­lated to the monar­chy as Mr Prayut stressed that the gov­ern­ment must pro­tect the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>He said: “This is the duty for all Thai cit­i­zens.”</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, a Thai court or­dered the shut­down of on­line broad­cast out­let Voice TV.</p>
    <p>‘WAY OF KINGS’</p>
    <p>Nowhere is this brew­ing con­flict more ap­par­ent than in Ratchadam­noen Av­enue.</p>
    <p>“Ratchadam­noen is both one street in the cap­i­tal and also a re­flec­tion of the whole polity,” said Uni­ver­sity of Wis­con­sin-Madi­son po­lit­i­cal his­to­rian Tyrell Haberkorn.</p>
    <p>In­spired by Euro­pean boule­vards like Champ El­y­sees in Paris, the “Way of Kings”, as it is called in Thai, was com­mis­sioned by King Chu­la­longkorn in 1899 to link the an­cient Grand Palace with the newer Dusit Palace over 3km away.</p>
    <p>It was meant to be a sig­nal of Si­amese moder­nity, directed at po­ten­tial colonis­ers.</p>
    <p>Mod­ern-day Ratchadam­noen is a ma­jor artery through a district that is home to some of Thai­land’s most im­por­tant in­sti­tu­tions – the palace, the army and, un­til last year, the Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>“Ratchadam­noen Av­enue is the most im­por­tant av­enue in Thai pol­i­tics,” said Dr Cha­tri Prak­it­non­thakan, an ar­chi­tec­tural his­to­rian at Sil­pakorn Uni­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>“It is also a con­tested space.” Long-time res­i­dent Niaw Sae­han, 83, still re­mem­bers the day when the young King Ananda Mahi­dol – King Va­ji­ra­longkorn’s un­cle – ar­rived in the coun­try af­ter World War II. Those were the days when steak at Mr Niaw’s fam­ily-run restau­rant by the Grand Palace cost the princely sum of 3 baht.</p>
    <p>“The restau­rant was so crowded, be­cause ev­ery­one had come to see the royal fam­ily,” he said. “That was my hap­pi­est mem­ory.”</p>
    <p>Sanam Luang, or “royal field” by the Grand Palace, once hosted a week­end flea mar­ket where lo­cals could pick up sec­ond-hand Van Heusen shirts.</p>
    <p>Used by suc­ces­sive gov­ern­ments to build their own nar­ra­tives, Ratchadam­noen’s char­ac­ter changes with the po­lit­i­cal wind.</p>
    <p>Now, it is once again trans­form­ing un­der what Dr Cha­tri has called an “ide­o­log­i­cal cleans­ing” project to rid traces of the group that top­pled ab­so­lute monar­chy.</p>
    <p>Af­ter 1932, the gov­ern­ment led by the Khana Rat­sadon, or “Peo­ple’s Party”, erected Art Deco-style build­ings, us­ing the sim­ple forms to con­vey the egal­i­tar­ian ideals of a demo­cratic Thai­land.</p>
    <p>Tham­masat Uni­ver­sity was es­tab­lished to ed­u­cate peo­ple about democ­racy. The Supreme Court was added, bear­ing im­pos­ing pil­lars that rep­re­sented the party’s six prin­ci­ples en­shrin­ing equal­ity and peo­ple’s wel­fare.</p>
    <p>The seven-storey-high Democ­racy Mon­u­ment – with a gi­ant replica of Thai­land’s first Con­sti­tu­tion rest­ing on a golden pedestal – was erected i n t he cen­tre of Ratchadam­noen.</p>
    <p>“The mon­u­ment is very hard to ac­cess, since it is in the mid­dle of a busy multi-lane traf­fic cir­cle and is fre­quently blocked off. The mes­sage is clear: You must suf­fer and risk your life for democ­racy,” said Dr Haberkorn.</p>
    <p>“Its lo­ca­tion on Ratchadam­noen pro­vides another layer of sym­bolic mean­ing: Democ­racy is con­tained within the Way of Kings.”</p>
    <p>This in­her­ent ten­sion be­tween roy­al­ist and demo­cratic forces con­tin­ues to leave its mark on Thai pol­i­tics and Ratchadam­noen’s ar­chi­tec­ture.</p>
    <p>The Supreme Court was de­mol­ished in 2012, its flat-top struc­ture re­placed with a more Thai-style de­sign, in a throw­back to the tra­di­tional build­ings used to de­note hi­er­ar­chy.</p>
    <p>In 2017, a brass plaque com­mem­o­rat­ing the 1932 rev­o­lu­tion dis­ap­peared. It was re­placed with one bear­ing the cur­rent Chakri dy­nasty’s motto. Of­fi­cials can­not say how or why the switch oc­curred.</p>
    <p>Many Art Deco build­ings along Ratchadam­noen have now been emp­tied out and boarded up.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, the Crown Prop­erty Bureau (CPB), which owns the land around Ratchadam­noen, shared briefly on its web­site that it would ren­o­vate build­ings in the</p>
    <p>“neo­clas­si­cal” style.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted by The Straits Times, the CPB said it does not give press in­ter­views.</p>
    <p>The “Way of Kings” con­tin­ues to be a stag­ing ground for stun­ning royal dis­plays. It was where thou­sands turned up to pros­trate them­selves be­fore King Va­ji­ra­longkorn as he sat aloft a gilded palan­quin dur­ing his coronation last year.</p>
    <p>He has be­come, ar­guably, the world’s rich­est monarch, tak­ing per­sonal own­er­ship of an es­ti­mated US$40 bil­lion (S$54.3 bil­lion) or more in as­sets man­aged by the CPB as well as con­trol of two army units.</p>
    <p>The newly en­throned King also sent a Con­sti­tu­tion al­ready ap­proved by a na­tional ref­er­en­dum back to the gov­ern­ment for amend­ments. And he would go on to anoint a royal con­sort, and then sack her, only to re­in­state her less than one year later.</p>
    <p>On Aug 3, 36-year-old l awyer Arnon Nampa, dressed like Harry Pot­ter with a wand to take on “he who must not be named”, went on stage at an anti-gov­ern­ment</p>
    <p>SUF­FER FOR DEMOC­RACY</p>
    <p>The mon­u­ment is very hard to ac­cess, since it is in the mid­dle of a busy multi-lane traf­fic cir­cle and is fre­quently blocked off. The mes­sage is clear:</p>
    <p>You must suf­fer and risk your life for democ­racy.</p>
    <p>DR TYRELL HABERKORN, Uni­ver­sity of Wis­con­sin-Madi­son po­lit­i­cal his­to­rian, on the Democ­racy Mon­u­ment. CLI­MATE OF FEAR</p>
    <p>I saw peo­ple pile bod­ies up with tyres to burn them on the road. No­body dared to say any­thing, be­cause we didn’t know who was who. Any­body could have pointed the fin­ger at you and said you were a com­mu­nist. I wanted to cry but I could not cry.</p>
    <p>MR CHATTAWA KLINSUNTOR­N, a for­mer sen­a­tor and jour­nal­ist, on his most un­for­get­table im­age of Ratchadam­noen Av­enue. On Oct 6, 1976, pro­test­ers in Tham­masat Uni­ver­sity, who were ral­ly­ing against the re­turn of for­mer dic­ta­tor Thanom Kit­tika­chorn, were at­tacked by se­cu­rity forces and ul­tra-roy­al­ist mobs.</p>
    <p>protest by the Democ­racy Mon­u­ment. “We have a democ­racy with a con­sti­tu­tional monar­chy, but the monar­chy al­ready has power be­yond what is al­lowed in the sys­tem,” he said. “This is­sue needs to be se­ri­ously dis­cussed.”</p>
    <p>As of yes­ter­day morn­ing, Arnon was still de­tained along­side Panusaya Sithi­ji­rawat­tanakul, a Tham­masat Uni­ver­sity stu­dent who tried to con­vey 10 de­mands for monar­chy re­form di­rectly to the King dur­ing a Septem­ber protest by the Grand Palace.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing that two-day gath­er­ing, protest lead­ers de­clared them­selves the mod­ern-day Khana Rat­sadon and un­veiled their own ver­sion of the 1932 rev­o­lu­tion plaque.</p>
    <p>They ce­mented it into the ground at Sanam Luang. Within 24 hours, the plaque was gone.</p>
    <p>BACK TO THE FU­TURE</p>
    <p>Mr Chattawa Klinsuntor­n, 76, is a for­mer sen­a­tor who spent two decades work­ing as a jour­nal­ist in Si­amrath, a news­pa­per for­merly head­quar­tered in Ratchadam­noen.</p>
    <p>Asked about his most in­deli­ble mem­ory of the av­enue, he wells up with emo­tion.</p>
    <p>It was Oct 6, 1976, when pro­test­ers in Tham­masat Uni­ver­sity, who were ral­ly­ing against the re­turn of for­mer dic­ta­tor Thanom Kit­tika­chorn, were de­nounced as com­mu­nists, and then at­tacked by se­cu­rity forces and ul­tra-roy­al­ist mobs.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cially, 46 peo­ple were killed that day, but sur­vivors say the ac­tual toll is far higher.</p>
    <p>“I saw peo­ple pile bod­ies up with tyres to burn them on the road. No­body dared to say any­thing, be­cause we didn’t know who was who. Any­body could have pointed the fin­ger at you and said you were a com­mu­nist,” said Mr Chattawa, dab­bing his eyes with tis­sue. “I wanted to cry but I could not cry.”</p>
    <p>He saw a half-naked woman be­ing dragged by a rope around her neck, and peo­ple stab­bing her with sticks. “I still re­mem­ber her face,” he said.</p>
    <p>Some par­al­lels are be­ing drawn with the present-day protest move­ment amid the po­lit­i­cal di­vide with in­di­vid­u­als like veteran politi­cian Warong Dechgitvi­grom launch­ing a group called Thai Pakdee, or “Loyal Thais”, to pro­tect the monar­chy against “na­tion-haters”.</p>
    <p>“There is no rea­son to cor­rect or change the monar­chy,” he told The Straits Times. “This coun­try’s prob­lems have never been caused by the monar­chy, but by politi­cians.”</p>
    <p>Dr Warong al­leges that the pro­test­ers are try­ing to stoke vi­o­lent con­flict.</p>
    <p>“We know that is what they want, so we’ve never or­gan­ised any protest to di­rectly con­front them. We let them ex­er­cise their rights and de­mands, and we sup­port the gov­ern­ment to ar­rest any­one who vi­o­lates the laws,” he said.</p>
    <p>“But I can’t say that for all Thais. Their pa­tience is wear­ing thin with each pass­ing day.”</p>
