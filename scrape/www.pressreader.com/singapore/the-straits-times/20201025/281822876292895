    <p>A blood test kit that can ac­cu­rately de­tect gas­tric can­cer in its early stages is be­ing rolled out in lo­cal hos­pi­tals and eval­u­ated for use in pri­mary care set­tings such as poly­clin­ics, said the Na­tional Univer­sity Health System (NUHS) on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The test kit, known as Gas­tro­clear, is the first of its kind in the world. It has been pro­gres­sively rolled out in pub­lic hos­pi­tals such as Na­tional Univer­sity Hospi­tal (NUH) and Tan Tock Seng Hospi­tal, some pri­vate gen­eral prac­ti­tioner clin­ics and spe­cial­ist clin­ics for pre­screen­ing of gas­tric can­cer.</p>
    <p>This form of can­cer is usu­ally di­ag­nosed through en­doscopy, a pro­ce­dure per­ceived to be ex­pen­sive and in­va­sive, as it in­volves in­sert­ing a thin tube with a cam­era into the pa­tient’s mouth and all the way down to the stom­ach.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Min­istry of Health’s web­site, an en­doscopy costs around $200 to $800 with med­i­cal sub­sidy.</p>
    <p>Us­ing the blood test would be more cost-ef­fec­tive – it is priced at un­der $200 at pub­lic hos­pi­tals. The test is also non-in­va­sive, can en­cour­age higher up­take among the pub­lic for early de­tec­tion of the can­cer and re­duce re­liance on en­doscopy.</p>
    <p>The test can de­tect 87 per cent of all gas­tric can­cers, in­clud­ing 87.5 per cent of stage one can­cers, com­pared with con­ven­tional blood tests which have only an ac­cu­racy rate of be­tween 50 per cent and 60 per cent.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause con­ven­tional tests are usu­ally used for mon­i­tor­ing the pa­tient’s re­sponse to can­cer treat­ment or can­cer re­cur­rence, and are not suit­able for iden­ti­fy­ing can­cer pa­tients.</p>
    <p>The project to de­velop the new</p>
    <p>blood test be­gan in 2012.</p>
    <p>It was led by Pro­fes­sor Jimmy So, head and se­nior con­sul­tant with NUH’s Di­vi­sion of Gen­eral Surgery (up­per gas­troin­testi­nal surgery); Pro­fes­sor Yeoh Khay Guan, se­nior con­sul­tant with NUH’s Di­vi­sion of Gas­troen­terol­ogy and Hepa­tol­ogy; and As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Too HengPhon from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine’s Depart­ment of Bio­chem­istry.</p>
    <p>The team also in­cluded clin­i­cians and sci­en­tists from NUHS, the Bio­pro­cess­ing Technology In­sti­tute (BTI) of the Agency for Sci­ence, Technology and Research (A*Star), na­tional plat­form Di­ag­nos­tics De­vel­op­ment (DxD) Hub, and MiRXES, a molec­u­lar di­ag­nos­tic com­pany which was spun off from BTI.</p>
    <p>The test kit was first man­u­fac­tured in 2012, and has been able to dif­fer­en­ti­ate be­tween gas­tric can­cer pa­tients and nor­mal pa­tients us­ing 12 mi­croRNA biomark­ers with an ac­cu­racy rate of 92 per cent.</p>
    <p>Be­tween 2013 and 2018, it was val­i­dated among some 5,000 sub­jects from Sin­ga­pore and re­ceived ap­proval from the Health Sciences Author­ity last year.</p>
    <p>Said Prof So: “The ma­jor­ity of gas­tric can­cer pa­tients are di­ag­nosed</p>
    <p>at ad­vanced stages, for which the five-year sur­vival rate is lower than 5 per cent.</p>
    <p>“On the other hand, the five-year sur­vival rate for stage one can­cer is at more than 90 per cent. Early de­tect­ing is thus key to re­duc­ing death from gas­tric can­cer.”</p>
    <p>As it costs less than en­doscopy, the test could po­ten­tially be used as part of the na­tional screen­ing pro­gramme for gas­tric can­cer in high risk groups.</p>
    <p>As­soc Prof Too, how­ever, em­pha­sised that the test does not re­place en­doscopy, and in­stead pro­vides an op­tion to pa­tients who may not be keen on ini­tial en­do­scopic screen­ing.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause en­doscopy still re­mains the gold stan­dard for ac­cu­rately di­ag­nos­ing gas­tric can­cer, as it in­volves a biopsy of the af­fected tis­sue.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the test “adds to the cur­rent can­cer de­tec­tion tool ar­ma­men­tar­ium” by of­fer­ing a pre­screen­ing op­tion for at-risk pa­tients, so that those with gas­tric can­cer can be iden­ti­fied early.</p>
    <p>The team is now look­ing to de­velop sim­i­lar blood tests for early di­ag­no­sis of lung, liver and breast can­cers.</p>
