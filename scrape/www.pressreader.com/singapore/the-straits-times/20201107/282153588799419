    <p>In the end, the big­gest in­ter­fer­ence in Amer­ica’s elec­tions didn’t come from Rus­sia, or China, or Iran or North Korea. It came from the Pres­i­dent of the United States.</p>
    <p>As I write this, we still don’t know for cer­tain who won the elec­tion, al­though Mr Joe Bi­den seems in a strong po­si­tion to win the White House and the Repub­li­cans to re­tain the Se­nate.</p>
    <p>But we do know for cer­tain that Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump lied to the public early Wed­nes­day when he claimed vic­tory and sought a ju­di­cial res­cue from vot­ers. His brazen­ness un­der­mines our elec­tion sys­tem and the very idea of a peace­ful tran­si­tion of power.</p>
    <p>It’s hard to imag­ine that the Supreme Court, how­ever politi­cised it may have be­come, would go along with such a cha­rade.</p>
    <p>I don’t be­lieve that Mr Trump, if he loses in a clear-cut way, will be able to re­main in of­fice; if he tries to bar­ri­cade him­self in the Oval Of­fice, he’ll be es­corted out on</p>
    <p>Jan 20.</p>
    <p>Yet what Mr Trump has al­ready done is what the Rus­sians have al­ways tried to do: cast doubt on Amer­i­can elec­tions and desta­bilise the US.</p>
    <p>The 2018 fed­eral in­dict­ment of Rus­sian elec­tion hack­ers al­leged that they were en­gaged in “in­for­ma­tion war­fare against the United States of Amer­ica”, by fos­ter­ing con­fu­sion and dis­trust that im­pair the in­tegrity of elec­tions and dam­age the le­git­i­macy of the gov­ern­ment that emerges. That’s pre­cisely what Mr Trump is now do­ing.</p>
    <p>He may hug and kiss Amer­i­can flags and pre­tend to be a great pa­triot, but this is a be­trayal of his coun­try.</p>
    <p>If Mr Bi­den wins af­ter this poi­son­ing of the chal­ice, he will in­herit a badly di­vided coun­try af­ter an elec­tion that many will deem il­le­git­i­mate, and it will be harder to gov­ern and more dif­fi­cult for the US to ex­ert in­flu­ence around the world.</p>
    <p>It’s one thing for Rus­sian hack­ers in St Peters­burg to sab­o­tage our gov­ern­ment; it’s far more tragic when the Pres­i­dent does the same from the White House.</p>
    <p>Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence spoke right af­ter Mr Trump and did not re­peat the Pres­i­dent’s claim of vic­tory or his call for the courts to in­ter­vene. But Mr Pence let his boss’ lies stand, and most lead­ing Repub­li­cans have also kept quiet.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s lat­est at­tack on the in­tegrity of Amer­ica’s elec­toral sys­tem and on the peace­ful trans­fer of power – the lit­mus test for any democ­racy – comes af­ter years of other lies and ef­forts to dis­credit the elec­toral sys­tem.</p>
    <p>And yes, it’s true that it is an elec­toral sys­tem that has ob­vi­ous un­demo­cratic el­e­ments, but these aren’t what Mr Trump has been talk­ing about.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den will eas­ily win the pop­u­lar vote by mil­lions of bal­lots, yet the out­come is in doubt only be­cause of the Elec­toral Col­lege.</p>
    <p>Be­tween 2000 and 2016, in two of the three times when Repub­li­cans won the pres­i­dency, it was while los­ing the pop­u­lar vote. And if the Supreme Court does weigh in on this elec­tion, one-third of the jus­tices were ap­pointed by Mr Trump af­ter he lost the pop­u­lar vote by 2.9 mil­lion votes.</p>
    <p>The Se­nate has sim­i­lar is­sues. The cur­rent Demo­crat sen­a­tors rep­re­sent 14 mil­lion more vot­ers than the Se­nate Repub­li­cans, but it’s the Democrats who are in the mi­nor­ity be­cause of the out­size in­flu­ence of low-pop­u­la­tion states.</p>
    <p>Se­na­tor Mike Lee, a Repub­li­can from Utah, has bluntly said, “we’re not a democ­racy” but a re­pub­lic (ac­tu­ally, we’re both).</p>
    <p>Mr Lee, along with Se­na­tor Ted Cruz of Texas, even rec­om­mended re­peal­ing the 17th Amend­ment, which pro­vides for di­rect elec­tion of sen­a­tors.</p>
    <p>If sen­a­tors were again cho­sen by state leg­is­la­tures, Repub­li­cans would gain a few seats. More broadly, much of the Repub­li­can</p>
    <p>Party seems to fear vot­ers and be­lieves that its best path to vic­tory is to sup­press vot­ing or even, in the case of Har­ris County, Texas, dis­card bal­lots.</p>
    <p>We no longer have poll taxes and grand­fa­ther clauses to dis­en­fran­chise black vot­ers, but GOP of­fi­cials mod­ernised the bar­ri­ers to vot­ing by peo­ple of colour.</p>
    <p>TRUMP’S FAITH­FUL BASE</p>
    <p>One care­ful study pub­lished in Sci­en­tific Amer­i­can last year found that vot­ers in pre­dom­i­nantly black neigh­bour­hoods are 74 per cent more likely to have to wait more than 30 min­utes to vote than res­i­dents of white neigh­bour­hoods.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump him­self said in March that he op­posed ef­forts to en­cour­age more vot­ing be­cause</p>
    <p>“if you agreed to it, you’d never have a Repub­li­can elected in this coun­try again”.</p>
    <p>Yet here’s an­other thought: Per­haps Repub­li­cans and Democrats alike have been too quick to as­sume that higher turnouts are in­evitably bad for GOP prospects.</p>
    <p>This elec­tion ap­pears to have had the high­est turnout in 120 years, and Mr Bi­den and Mr Trump may end up as the No. 1 and No. 2 win­ners of the pop­u­lar vote in Amer­i­can his­tory.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump had the sup­port of mil­lions more vot­ers in this elec­tion than four years ago. Ac­cord­ing to exit polls, Mr Trump won votes from 18 per cent of black men and 36 per cent of Latino men, along with those of 58 per cent of white men.</p>
    <p>The Democrats had a great deal go­ing for them in this elec­tion: a nom­i­nee viewed as sooth­ing and electable, streams of new out­rages from Mr Trump, fre­quent rev­e­la­tions of cor­rup­tion or im­pro­pri­eties in­volv­ing him, de­nun­ci­a­tions of him from fam­ily mem­bers and for­mer aides, and above all, a mis­man­aged pan­demic that killed 230,000 Amer­i­cans and dev­as­tated the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Yet many vot­ers saw all this and were un­fazed.</p>
    <p>Dr Ir­win Redlener, an ex­pert in man­ag­ing health dis­as­ters, says that Mr Trump won nine of the 10 states with the high­est preva­lence of coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>So as I fret about Mr Trump’s ef­forts to do Rus­sia’s work and dele­git­imise this elec­tion, I also keep wrestling with this ques­tion: How is it that so many mil­lions of Amer­i­cans watched Mr Trump for four years, suf­fered the pain of his bungling of Covid-19, lis­tened to his stream of lies, ob­served his at­tacks on Amer­i­can in­sti­tu­tions – and then voted for him in greater num­bers than be­fore?</p>
