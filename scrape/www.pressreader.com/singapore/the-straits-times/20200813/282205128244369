    <p>Straits Times colum­nist Ly­dia Lim makes sev­eral im­por­tant points about the care sec­tor in Sin­ga­pore (Re-imag­ine Sin­ga­pore as a care econ­omy, Aug 9).</p>
    <p>Given that there is go­ing to be a dra­matic in­crease in the need for pro­fes­sional care­givers as Sin­ga­pore’s pop­u­la­tion ages, espe­cially for home care, why do Sin­ga­pore­ans un­der­value them?</p>
    <p>Per­haps it’s be­cause, for some kinds of care, it is of­ten car­ried out by a fam­ily mem­ber or by for­eign do­mes­tic helpers. Maybe the logic is “if I can do it my­self, then why pay for a pro­fes­sional?”.</p>
    <p>The an­swer to that ques­tion lies in the word “pro­fes­sional” – it im­plies a stan­dard of knowl­edge, skill, train­ing and for­mal qual­i­fi­ca­tion that goes be­yond what an ev­ery­day per­son would pos­sess.</p>
    <p>As some­one who was a part-time care­giver for many years, I can at­test to the stress and emo­tional bur­den that care­givers ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>This is go­ing to in­crease as care­giv­ing moves more from the phys­i­cal to the emo­tional well-be­ing of the re­cip­i­ents – which will hap­pen be­cause of the in­crease in de­men­tia cases, as well as the side ef­fects of age-re­lated phys­i­cal ill­nesses.</p>
    <p>What can be done?</p>
    <p>Af­ford­abil­ity is an is­sue even in Sin­ga­pore. While there are govern­ment grants, they are means tested and lim­ited in ap­pli­ca­bil­ity. As for pri­vate med­i­cal care, per­haps a part of Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund sav­ings can be un­locked for re­cur­ring care needs filled by pri­vate care providers, espe­cially for home care.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers, whether in­di­vid­u­als or com­pa­nies, need to un­der­stand the bur­den and value of care­giv­ing.</p>
    <p>For pro­fes­sional em­ploy­ers, they are lim­ited in how much they can pay by how much they can charge, but au­toma­tion can help re­duce over­heads.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there are other ac­tions em­ploy­ers can take. At present, most care­givers are ei­ther em­ployed full time or work for plat­form providers where they are in ef­fect self-em­ployed con­trac­tors.</p>
    <p>This means a choice be­tween se­cu­rity with lit­tle flex­i­bil­ity, and flex­i­bil­ity with lit­tle se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>There is a mid­dle way, which is to pro­vide flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments that guar­an­tee a cer­tain num­ber of hours and level of pay, while al­low­ing flex­i­bil­ity in when those hours are worked.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power’s guide­lines do pro­vide for this, but they are not clear, and more in­cen­tives should be pro­vided for em­ploy­ers and em­ploy­ees to adopt such schemes.</p>
