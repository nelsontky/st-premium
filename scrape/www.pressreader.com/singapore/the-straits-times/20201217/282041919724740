    <p>Con­stantly check­ing for news about the Covid-19 pan­demic takes a toll on men­tal health, a Sin­ga­pore study of more than 1,100 par­tic­i­pants has shown.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple who spent more time check­ing the news – for ex­am­ple, more than two hours a day – at the peak of the pan­demic in Sin­ga­pore were at a higher risk of feel­ing de­pressed, anx­ious and stressed.</p>
    <p>The study, con­ducted by YaleNUS Col­lege as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor of so­cial sciences (psy­chol­ogy) Jean Liu, was pub­lished in the Jour­nal of Med­i­cal In­ter­net Re­search in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>It is the first of five Covid-19-re­lated projects she has been work­ing on since March, to be pub­lished i n an i nter­na­tional aca­demic jour­nal.</p>
    <p>To­gether with her col­lab­o­ra­tor, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ed­die Tong from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s psy­chol­ogy de­part­ment, Prof Liu sur­veyed some 1,145 par­tic­i­pants – most of whom were Sin­ga­pore­ans – be­tween March 7 and April 21.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing that pe­riod, the Repub­lic recorded its first two deaths from the coro­n­avirus, as well as a peak in daily cases – both im­ported and in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the start of the cir­cuit breaker on April 7, mask wear­ing be­came manda­tory and safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures were tight­ened.</p>
    <p>Nine in 10 of the study’s par­tic­i­pants spent two hours or less con­sum­ing news on Covid-19.</p>
    <p>But the 10 per cent who spent more than two hours daily read­ing about the pan­demic – and par­tic­u­larly those who con­stantly checked for up­dates – present a case for con­cern, said Prof Liu.</p>
    <p>These par­tic­i­pants re­ported in­creased symp­toms of de­pres­sion, anx­i­ety and stress in an on­line ques­tion­naire of 21 ques­tions widely used by re­searchers to mea­sure well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>Said Prof Liu: “It’s not to say that we must bury our heads in the sand and not get any up­dates at all, but spend­ing ex­ces­sive amounts of time get­ting up­dates is a prob­lem.”</p>
    <p>She added that other stud­ies have found that dur­ing crises, such as the so­cial un­rest in Hong Kong, spend­ing more than two hours a day get­ting up­dates pre­dicted worse men­tal health.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic is the first truly in­ter­na­tional pub­lic health cri­sis since the ex­plo­sion of so­cial me­dia plat­forms, she said.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ous health crises such as Zika or Ebola were not as pro­longed and widespread, and so­cial me­dia chat­ter then was noth­ing com­pared with what was gen­er­ated by Covid-19, she added.</p>
    <p>Said Prof Liu: “This pan­demic has gen­er­ated a lot of con­tent, both in terms of in­for­ma­tion and mis­in­for­ma­tion. Peo­ple are ex­posed to a lot of up­dates and rumours from global and lo­cal sources. In­creas­ingly, they get up­dates from tra­di­tional and so­cial me­dia sources.</p>
    <p>“Anx­i­ety has a lot to do with wor­ry­ing and be­ing afraid... So when you come across ar­ti­cles that tell you not to do this or that, it’s scary to nav­i­gate a world where ev­ery­thing is sud­denly dan­ger­ous.”</p>
    <p>But Prof Liu’s study also found that ac­cu­rate and timely in­for­ma­tion from of­fi­cial sources helps to al­lay those fears.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants who sub­scribed to the Gov.sg chan­nel – which dis­trib­utes of­fi­cial up­dates and de­bunks false i nfor­ma­tion – re­ported less anx­i­ety and symp­toms of de­pres­sion than those who did not.</p>
    <p>Prof Liu said: “This shows that in­sti­tu­tional trust can help to mit­i­gate some of these neg­a­tive ef­fects, es­pe­cially when the Gov­ern­ment ad­dresses rumours quickly, as it did about the coun­try go­ing into l ock­down mode or about some­one dy­ing of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“If there is no trust, peo­ple may seek out other sources of in­for­ma­tion.”</p>
    <p>Not­ing that clin­i­cians had ear­lier this year also urged gov­ern­ments to adopt tech­nol­ogy to dis­sem­i­nate news, Prof Liu added: “My hope is that pub­lic health agen­cies can... de­liver in­for­ma­tion in a timely fash­ion, and con­sider chan­nels like What­sApp and Tele­gram.”</p>
    <p>Mes­sages on such plat­forms spread very eas­ily as most peo­ple are al­ready us­ing such com­mu­ni­ca­tion apps, and they can be eas­ily for­warded to groups, she said.</p>
    <p>Prof Liu, who runs the So­cial Neuro-En­docrinol­ogy Re­search Group – also known as The Syn­ergy Lab at Yale-NUS – is also study­ing, with mem­bers of the lab, how Covid-19 has im­pacted peo­ple in dif­fer­ent ways.</p>
    <p>One study mon­i­tored peo­ple’s us­age of What­sApp for a pe­riod of one week be­tween March and May to see how per­va­sive the topic of Covid-19 was in their con­ver­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>The other stud­ies are on top­ics such as the take-up of TraceTo­gether, Covid-19 rumours and how fre­quently peo­ple shared these, as well as be­havioural changes due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It’s not to say that we must bury our heads in the sand and not get any up­dates at all, but spend­ing ex­ces­sive amounts of time get­ting up­dates is a prob­lem... Anx­i­ety has a lot to do with wor­ry­ing and be­ing afraid... So when you come across ar­ti­cles that tell you not to do this or that, it’s scary to nav­i­gate a world where ev­ery­thing is sud­denly dan­ger­ous.</p>
