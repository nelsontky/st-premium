    <p>A six-year-old girl who trav­elled from In­dia was among the 24 coro­n­avirus cases – all im­ported – con­firmed by the Min­istry of Health yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The de­pen­dant’s pass holder is linked to three pre­vi­ously re­ported cases.</p>
    <p>The new cases take Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,721. All were asymp­to­matic and tested pos­i­tive while serv­ing stay-home no­tice or in iso­la­tion af­ter their ar­rival here. Be­sides the girl, the oth­ers were a Sin­ga­porean, an­other de­pen­dant’s pass holder, two work pass hold­ers, a short-term visit pass holder and 18 work per­mit hold­ers.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean is a 62-year-old woman who re­turned from the United States. The de­pen­dant’s pass hold­ers and work pass hold­ers ar­rived from In­dia. The 18 work per­mit hold­ers, of whom 15 are for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers, ar­rived from In­done­sia and In­dia.</p>
    <p>One of the work per­mit hold­ers is a 28-year-old In­done­sian man who boarded a ves­sel on Nov 1 last year in In­done­sia. Last Thurs­day, he was placed on quar­an­tine as he had been iden­ti­fied as a close con­tact of a pre­vi­ously re­ported case, who is a crew mem­ber on the same ves­sel. He was taken to a govern­ment quar­an­tine fa­cil­ity on Satur­day, and tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 on Sun­day. Be­fore that, he had not left the ves­sel.</p>
    <p>The short-term visit pass holder is a 29-year-old man who ar­rived from Ro­ma­nia to board a ship docked here as a crew mem­ber.</p>
    <p>With 10 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 58,482 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease. A to­tal of 67 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, in­clud­ing one in the in­ten­sive care unit, while 128 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
