    <p>Aries</p>
    <p>(March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Try to show some­one close how much you care – with ac­tions, not words. You should find that the two of you are even closer by day’s end.</p>
    <p>Tau­rus</p>
    <p>(April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>Take in a show tonight – go­ing out is aus­pi­cious for you. If you can­not, your mood is sure to im­prove with some of your favourite music.</p>
    <p>Gemini</p>
    <p>(May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Pay at­ten­tion to the small stuff even if it gets re­ally bor­ing. It is a great time for you to take care of er­rands that you have been putting off.</p>
    <p>Can­cer</p>
    <p>(June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>You get good news, though it may fly un­der the radar. Stay open to all mes­sages so you can fig­ure out what the uni­verse is try­ing to say.</p>
    <p>Leo</p>
    <p>(July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Take a sec­ond look at your bud­get. One lit­tle de­tail is all it takes to turn things up­side down. Root it out be­fore it be­comes a prob­lem.</p>
    <p>Virgo</p>
    <p>(Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>You have achieved some­thing great, though you may not re­alise it. The en­ergy around you should of­fer a clue. Good news should come soon.</p>
    <p>Libra</p>
    <p>(Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>You are fac­ing too many projects or de­mands. Try to pri­ori­tise so you can get back on track, but do not sweat the small stuff for now.</p>
    <p>Scorpio</p>
    <p>(Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>You have se­crets to spare, so keep track of who knows what. Your en­ergy is great, but it is im­por­tant you re­mem­ber all your sto­ries.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s</p>
    <p>(Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>Try not to push your­self too hard or you may end up mov­ing back­wards. Your en­ergy is a lit­tle off, so see if you can just ride it out.</p>
    <p>Capricorn</p>
    <p>(Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>You need to look up some facts or dates – and your an­a­lyt­i­cal mind is per­fect for re­search. You may learn some­thing that changes your plans.</p>
    <p>Aquarius</p>
    <p>(Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Take an­other look at your emo­tions. The day brings sta­bil­ity and you should be able to come to terms with what has been both­er­ing you.</p>
    <p>Pisces</p>
    <p>(Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>Avoid pro­ject­ing neg­a­tive emo­tions on oth­ers, tempt­ing though it may be. You are feel­ing well bal­anced, so it should not be dif­fi­cult.</p>
