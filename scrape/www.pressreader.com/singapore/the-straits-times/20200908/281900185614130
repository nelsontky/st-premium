    <p>Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte has granted an ab­so­lute par­don to a US ser­vice­man who was found guilty of killing a Filipino trans­gen­der woman nearly five years ago.</p>
    <p>For­eign Sec­re­tary Teodoro Loc­sin first broke the news on his Twit­ter ac­count that Lance Cor­po­ral Joseph Scott Pem­ber­ton, 25, could now walk free.</p>
    <p>“Cut­ting mat­ters short over what con­sti­tutes time served, and since where he was de­tained was not in the pris­oner’s con­trol – and to do jus­tice – the Pres­i­dent has granted an ab­so­lute par­don to Pem­ber­ton,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte’s spokesman Harry Roque con­firmed that Mr Duterte “had erased the jail term that Pem­ber­ton should have served”.</p>
    <p>“He can go home be­cause he has been par­doned,” said Mr Roque, who once served as a lawyer for the vic­tim’s fam­ily.</p>
    <p>The spokesman in­sisted that the Pres­i­dent did not over­turn Pem­ber­ton’s con­vic­tion.</p>
    <p>“He’s still a killer,” said Mr Roque. Pem­ber­ton was found guilty of killing Ms Jen­nifer Laude, then 26, in a drunken rage in­side a mo­tel in Olon­gapo city, near the for­mer US naval base in Su­bic Bay, north of the cap­i­tal Manila.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court records, Pem­ber­ton, who was off-duty af­ter par­tic­i­pat­ing in a joint mil­i­tary ex­er­cise off Su­bic, met Ms Laude, who was dressed as a school­girl, at a bar at Olon­gapo’s red-light district on Oct 12, 2014. They later agreed to head to a nearby mo­tel.</p>
    <p>While hav­ing sex, the ma­rine turned vi­o­lent when he re­alised that Ms Laude – who was born “Jef­frey Laude” – had male gen­i­tals.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte’s de­ci­sion took even his crit­ics by sur­prise, con­sid­er­ing his anti-US rhetoric in re­cent years as he pur­sued closer ties with China.</p>
    <p>“What is the ba­sis of grant­ing ab­so­lute par­don to… Pem­ber­ton? Why pre-empt the court process? Why is the Pres­i­dent in a rush to par­don the killer of Filipino transwoman Jen­nifer Laude? The ab­so­lute par­don, and the con­text and tim­ing of the same, is a be­trayal of na­tional in­ter­est and a great in­jus­tice for the Laude fam­ily,” said Mr Re­nato Reyes, spokesman for the na­tion­al­ist group Bagong Alyansang Mak­abayan (New Peo­ple’s Al­liance).</p>
    <p>Mr Roque, how­ever, said Mr Duterte “was never anti-US”.</p>
    <p>“He has al­ways been for an in­de­pen­dent for­eign pol­icy,” he said.</p>
    <p>The case struck a nerve in the Philip­pines as ques­tions over cus­tody of US ser­vice­men ac­cused of crimes turned into ju­ris­dic­tional dis­putes that sparked heated de­bates on sovereignt­y.</p>
    <p>It once again tested pro­vi­sions of the 1999 Vis­it­ing Forces Agree­ment, specif­i­cally those on ju­ris­dic­tion over Amer­i­can troops who com­mit crimes while off-duty in the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte sought to scrap that pact in Fe­bru­ary, but changed his mind in June, not­ing the US’ help for the Philip­pines in its fight against the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
