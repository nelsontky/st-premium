    <p>While most pre­fer to stay dry, oth­ers are happy to em­brace the rain.</p>
    <p>The Ab­dat sib­lings have been hav­ing plenty of fun dur­ing the fre­quent down­pours re­cently, which have brought the tem­per­a­ture down to be­low 22 deg C on some days. Be­sides bak­ing and play­ing at home, they get to have fun out­doors as well.</p>
    <p>Ms Suhana Ab, 39, says: “My kids love it, es­pe­cially my sec­ond child who would shout, ‘It’s rain­ing, let’s go down.’”</p>
    <p>Her chil­dren are Arissa, eight; Omar, five; and Eissa, seven months old.</p>
    <p>With um­brel­las, rain­coats and pails in tow, they would rush out.</p>
    <p>This fam­ily ac­tiv­ity started with Ms Ab, cre­ative di­rec­tor at a chil­dren’s fash­ion la­bel, want­ing to col­lect rain­wa­ter for her in­door plants. She had read that they may be sen­si­tive to flu­o­ride found in tap wa­ter.</p>
    <p>While wait­ing for the pails to be filled up, Arissa and Omar asked if they could play in the rain.</p>
    <p>“I thought, ‘Why not?’” she says. “They’re only young once and such an ex­pe­ri­ence is some­thing they will re­mem­ber for a life­time.”</p>
    <p>Her two older kids, oc­ca­sion­ally joined by their six-year-old cousin Amaya Gu­nawan, get up to half an hour of fun in the rain. Then they head home im­me­di­ately for a warm shower and a cup of hot Milo.</p>
    <p>Al­low­ing chil­dren to play out­doors – in any weather – po­ten­tially in­creases their ex­po­sure to bac­te­ria or viruses, but most ex­perts re­gard this as a good thing be­cause it al­lows chil­dren to build a strong im­mu­nity and re­duce their risk of al­ler­gies.</p>
    <p>“Chil­dren get sick when they are ex­posed to bac­te­ria and viruses, not wa­ter or wet weather,” says Dr Natalie Ep­ton, a spe­cial­ist pae­di­a­tri­cian and neona­tol­o­gist at SBCC Baby and Child Clinic at Mount El­iz­a­beth Novena Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>She has three chil­dren aged 15, 12 and eight.</p>
    <p>She adds: “Ac­tu­ally, play­ing in the rain can be a fun and en­rich­ing ac­tiv­ity for chil­dren, ex­pos­ing them to new and ex­cit­ing sen­sory ex­pe­ri­ences, and teach­ing them to im­prove their mo­tor skills as they learn not to slip and slide in the mud.”</p>
