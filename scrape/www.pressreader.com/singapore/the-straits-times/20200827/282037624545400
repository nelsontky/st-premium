    <p>One of the hosts of an un­law­ful gath­er­ing in a Sengkang flat amid the Covid-19 out­break was fined $4,000 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Cassie Ong Shi Hong, who was then the fi­ancee of the flat’s owner, Leong Chee Mun, 37, pleaded guilty to an of­fence un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that they are no longer en­gaged to each other.</p>
    <p>The court heard that the 32-yearold Sin­ga­porean had ear­lier been of­fered a job in the child­care sec­tor.</p>
    <p>The em­ployer has since with­drawn its of­fer, fol­low­ing me­dia cov­er­age of the case, said her de­fence lawyers Jose­phus Tan, Mar­shall Lim and Cory Wong in their mit­i­ga­tion plea.</p>
    <p>The team from In­vic­tus Law added: “Cassie is there­fore once again in be­tween child­care jobs, and it had not been easy for her to land this prospec­tive job in the first place, given many par­ents’ aver­sion to send­ing their chil­dren to joint care fa­cil­i­ties and thereby in­creas­ing their risk of ex­po­sure to Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>Ong was the 11th per­son linked to the case to be dealt with in court.</p>
    <p>On Aug 5, Jack­son Tan Chia Ho and Jas­min Tan Ee Lin, both 30, were each fined $3,000.</p>
    <p>Poh Yang Ting, 21; Peh Si Qin, 22; Felisa Chua Jia Xuan, 23; Low Wei Hao, 25; Nic­man Lim Wei Fong, 25; Chee Min Hui, 27; Kho Zi Ting, 27; and Priscilia Tan Sze Hui, 32, were each fined $2,500.</p>
    <p>The cases in­volv­ing Leong and six other peo­ple are still pend­ing.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker from April 7 to June 1, mem­bers of the pub­lic were not al­lowed to leave their place of res­i­dence without a valid rea­son or meet other peo­ple not liv­ing in the same place of res­i­dence for any so­cial pur­pose.</p>
    <p>De­spite this, Jack­son Tan and Jas­min Tan were in the flat at Block 295C Com­pass­vale Cres­cent from around 6am on May 8, as they had break­fast there.</p>
    <p>The other guests turned up from around 9pm that day.</p>
    <p>While in the unit, the group min­gled and came into close con­tact with one an­other while en­gaged in var­i­ous ac­tiv­i­ties such as eat­ing, drink­ing al­co­holic bev­er­ages, play­ing games and watch­ing Net­flix pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>A res­i­dent in the same block alerted the po­lice to the gath­er­ing at around 2am the next day, stat­ing: “This has been go­ing on al­most ev­ery night.”</p>
    <p>The po­lice of­fi­cers who ar­rived at the unit later found the of­fend­ers in­side the flat.</p>
    <p>For each charge un­der t he Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act, a first-time of­fender can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to $10,000. A re­peat of­fender can be jailed for up to a year and fined up to $20,000.</p>
