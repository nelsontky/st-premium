    <p>Dis­tressed wa­ter treat­ment firm Hyflux has been liv­ing on borrowed time since it filed for bank­ruptcy pro­tec­tion in May 2018 and ob­tained a mora­to­rium for nearly $3 bil­lion in debts.</p>
    <p>One won­ders if the sword will fi­nally fall on Nov 16 at a High Court hear­ing that is sup­pos­edly the last chance for Hyflux to come up with a firm re­struc­tur­ing deal with broad sup­port. Ob­servers say it will likely be put un­der ju­di­cial man­age­ment if it fails to do so.</p>
    <p>De­spite be­ing given 12 ex­ten­sions of the debt mora­to­rium over</p>
    <p>21/ years, the Hyflux board is still no closer to nail­ing down a deal, and some cred­i­tors fear the group’s value is al­ready be­ing dis­si­pated. Com­pound­ing mat­ters, Hyflux and its cur­rent and for­mer di­rec­tors are now un­der probe for sus­pected false and mis­lead­ing state­ments and breaches of dis­clo­sure rules.</p>
    <p>With the board’s cred­i­bil­ity in ques­tion, more cred­i­tors los­ing con­fi­dence and no firm deal in hand, the ar­gu­ment for hav­ing a ju­di­cial man­ager (JM) in place to man­age Hyflux’s re­struc­tur­ing is get­ting stronger by the day.</p>
    <p>This es­pe­cially af­ter an ex­as­per­ated Jus­tice Aedit Ab­dul­lah, ac­cord­ing to a Busi­ness Times re­port, chas­tised Hyflux’s lawyer for mak­ing a last-minute re­quest for yet an­other ad­journ­ment on Oct 14, when a hear­ing was to have been held on whether to put the firm un­der ju­di­cial man­age­ment. The judge pointed to “sus­pi­cion... build­ing up con­sid­er­ably whether there is some sort of games­man­ship go­ing on here”.</p>
    <p>That, ac­cord­ing to gov­er­nance ex­pert Mak Yuen Teen, may re­fer to new “white knights” that have sur­faced in re­sponse to UAE util­ity Utico push­ing to get a deal done as well as the push for ju­di­cial man­age­ment by a large cred­i­tor – the un­se­cured work­ing group (UWG) of 19 banks that hold more than $931 mil­lion of debt.</p>
    <p>“Both are not the Hyflux board’s pre­ferred op­tions. Utico’s of­fer is not con­di­tional on the di­rec­tors be­ing re­leased from po­ten­tial li­a­bil­i­ties, and a JM could po­ten­tially take ac­tion against the di­rec­tors if there are breaches of du­ties,” As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Mak said.</p>
    <p>The lat­est suitor to emerge two days be­fore the ju­di­cial man­age­ment ap­pli­ca­tion hear­ing is Amer­i­can fund man­ager Strate­gic Growth In­vest­ments (SGI). It pro­poses to in­vest at least $204.8 mil­lion, with se­nior un­se­cured cred­i­tors get­ting $97 mil­lion, trade cred­i­tors</p>
    <p>$15.8 mil­lion, and the per­pet­ual se­cu­ri­ties and pref­er­ence shares (PnP) in­vestors $32 mil­lion – all on a pro-rata ba­sis. But SGI’s “ex­pres­sion of in­ter­est fol­lows the now too fa­mil­iar pat­tern of late and vague pro­pos­als re­ceived at the eleventh hour prior to hear­ings... and does not present a vi­able re­struc­tur­ing plan”,</p>
    <p>Mr Cosimo Bor­relli, man­ag­ing direc­tor at Bor­relli Walsh, a re­struc­tur­ing firm ad­vis­ing the UWG, said in court doc­u­ments seen by The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>An­other suitor is Pi­son, the in­vest­ment ve­hi­cle of In­done­sian mag­nate Johnny Wid­jaja. In early July, it made a for­mal cash of­fer for the debts of Hyflux’s bank lenders, note hold­ers and other se­nior un­se­cured cred­i­tors via a “re­verse Dutch auc­tion”. Pi­son’s of­fer is sub­ject to a min­i­mum of­fered dis­count of 91 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Hyflux ex­ec­u­tive chair­man and group chief ex­ec­u­tive Olivia Lum, “Pi­son con­firmed it agreed in-prin­ci­ple to pay up to nine cents in the dol­lar cash pay­ment on com­ple­tion of the debt pur­chase”, sub­ject to cer­tain con­di­tions in­clud­ing “reach­ing agree­ment on the terms of the pur­chase”.</p>
    <p>In com­par­i­son, if Hyflux were liq­ui­dated, “the es­ti­mated re­cov­ery for se­nior un­se­cured cred­i­tors of Hyflux was 2.8 per cent to 6.1 per cent, and it could take up to five years for re­turns to be re­alised”, Ms Lum said in court doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>In ask­ing for an ex­ten­sion of the mora­to­rium, she claimed that “Pi­son and the UWG ap­pear to be mak­ing progress to­wards the con­clu­sion of an agree­ment”.</p>
    <p>But Mr Bor­relli dis­agreed. “Pi­son has not demon­strated its bona fides as a po­ten­tial in­vestor and the terms of their debt pur­chase pro­gramme re­main un­ac­cept­able,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sias or the Se­cu­ri­ties In­vestors As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore) has re­peat­edly stressed that it would not sup­port any res­cue deal that does not in­clude a con­crete pro­posal to re­solve the $900 mil­lion owed to 34,000 retail in­vestors hold­ing Hyflux’s PnPs. Yet, Mr Bor­relli claims, “it is only in the fi­nal week be­fore the JM ap­pli­ca­tion hear­ing that Pi­son tells Sias that it is will­ing to meet to get their in­put”.</p>
    <p>In the fi­nal anal­y­sis, con­cerns over how to re­solve the debt owed to the retail PnP in­vestors may be partly why an un­usu­ally long leash was given to the com­pany-led re­struc­tur­ing ef­fort. This even though Jus­tice Aedit had warned Hyflux in May last year that he “will be keep­ing the com­pany on a tight leash” af­ter a $530 mil­lion deal with its first suitor, In­done­sian con­sor­tium SM In­vest­ments, was aborted and Utico sur­faced.</p>
    <p>If Hyflux is put into liq­ui­da­tion, the PnP in­vestors, a good num­ber of whom are mom-and-pop ones who in­vested their re­tire­ment funds and life sav­ings, will re­cover noth­ing. But 11/ years on, more cred­i­tors</p>
    <p>2 have lost faith in Hyflux’s abil­ity to de­liver a re­struc­tur­ing. Even if the odds of re­cov­ery seem bleak, a JM could ini­ti­ate ac­tion against the di­rec­tors if it be­lieves there have been breaches of du­ties and con­sider claw­back ac­tion. Hyflux will “no longer be com­pelled to pay a $26 mil­lion suc­cess fee” to its ad­viser once a JM is ap­pointed. That will pro­vide more than enough funds to cover the costs of ju­di­cial man­age­ment, Mr Bor­relli added.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Aedit had warned Hyflux in May last year that he would give the UWG “lib­erty to ap­ply to re­vive its ap­pli­ca­tion for ju­di­cial man­age­ment should cir­cum­stances change” and “leave this sword hang­ing over Hyflux’s head”.</p>
    <p>As the say­ing goes, jus­tice de­layed is jus­tice de­nied. Given that the Hyflux group has failed to achieve a re­struc­tur­ing in over two years, its as­sets and avail­able cash have suf­fered a huge de­ple­tion, and in view of the on­go­ing reg­u­la­tory in­ves­ti­ga­tions, per­haps it is time to tighten the leash.</p>
