    <p>PwC Sin­ga­pore will hon­our job of­fers made late last year to 200 grad­u­ates, even as it is cut­ting costs af­ter suf­fer­ing a sig­nif­i­cant drop in rev­enue dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Ex­ec­u­tive chair­man Yeoh Oon Jin noted that more skilled work­ers are needed to meet a grow­ing de­mand for dig­i­tal-re­lated busi­ness trans­for­ma­tion sup­port ser­vices. This is a key de­vel­op­ment as PwC evolves from pro­vid­ing pro­fes­sional ser­vices to tech­nol­ogy so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>Of its 3,500 em­ploy­ees in Sin­ga­pore, 300 are in dig­i­tal-re­lated ser­vices, and there are plans to hire more than 50 spe­cial­ists in ar­eas such as cy­ber se­cu­rity and data-re­lated ad­vi­sory ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeoh said that to help small and medium-sized en­ter­prises ac­cess over­seas mar­kets, PwC can help ad­vise them on how to en­ter the mar­kets, de­velop their on­line pres­ence and brand, and their mar­ket­ing dis­tri­bu­tion chan­nels.</p>
    <p>To that end, PwC Sin­ga­pore’s dig­i­tal busi­ness leader Greg Unsworth said it has set up a dig­i­tal in­no­va­tion of­fice and is look­ing to of­fer up to 40 dig­i­tal prod­ucts and so­lu­tions in the next 18 months. These in­clude a dig­i­tal fit­ness as­sess­ment app that al­lows peo­ple to up­skill them­selves in ar­eas like ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and ro­bot­ics, he said.</p>
    <p>Un­der­scor­ing the need for more busi­nesses to in­vest in dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion, Mr Yeoh said some of PwC’s clients were not able to pro­vide doc­u­ments for au­dits and other work be­cause their records were not fully digi­tised. The cir­cuit breaker from April to June saw most peo­ple work­ing from home, among other mea­sures. Some work sched­uled dur­ing the pe­riod had to be de­ferred, he said.</p>
    <p>PwC’s rev­enues were also af­fected by the de­fer­ment or can­cel­la­tion of some projects and deals amid the pan­demic, he added.</p>
    <p>There is also a height­ened risk of fraud that could re­sult as most peo­ple are still not able to work from the of­fice.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeoh said: “Man­age­ment and em­ploy­ees, in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tors, au­di­tors have to be more vig­i­lant... Some cus­tomers may not be able to re­pay their debts, so the au­dit­ing process has to be more thor­ough.”</p>
