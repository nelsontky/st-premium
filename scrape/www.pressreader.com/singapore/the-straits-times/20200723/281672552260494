    <p>Two busi­ness events, each with on­site at­ten­dance of up to 50 peo­ple, plus vir­tual at­ten­dance of many oth­ers, will take place in Sin­ga­pore in the next two months.</p>
    <p>If suc­cess­ful, this hy­brid for­mat could pave the way for more of such events to be held here, said the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) yesterday.</p>
    <p>The two func­tions are the first busi­ness events in­volv­ing phys­i­cal gath­er­ings to be held here since March, when all phys­i­cal busi­nessto-busi­ness (B2B) events, in­clud­ing meet­ings, con­ven­tions, ex­hi­bi­tions and trade shows, were put on hold as part of mea­sures to con­tain the Covid-19 out­break in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Such hy­brid events, with a mix of face-to-face and vir­tual in­ter­ac­tions, are “likely to be the norm for busi­ness events in the near fu­ture”, the board said.</p>
    <p>It also said that as Sin­ga­pore re­sumes economic ac­tiv­i­ties, “STB is pre­par­ing for the cal­i­brated and safe re­sump­tion of B2B events in the com­ing months”.</p>
    <p>“To do so, STB has de­vel­oped a risk man­age­ment frame­work for busi­ness events of up to 50 at­ten­dees, based on strict safe man­age­ment mea­sures,” it added.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Safe Busi­ness Event Risk Man­age­ment Frame­work, event or­gan­is­ers must achieve five key out­comes.</p>
    <p>They must have in­fec­tion con­trol mea­sures for ev­ery stage of the jour­ney of a per­son at­tend­ing the event, lim­its on crowd den­sity, lim­its on close con­tact be­tween in­di­vid­u­als, en­sure a safe and clean en­vi­ron­ment, and pre­pare for emer­gen­cies re­lated to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>STB said the frame­work was cre</p>
    <p>RISK MAN­AGE­MENT FRAME­WORK</p>
    <p>STB is pre­par­ing for the cal­i­brated and safe re­sump­tion of B2B events in the com­ing months. To do so, STB has de­vel­oped a risk man­age­ment frame­work for busi­ness events of up to 50 at­ten­dees, based on strict safe man­age­ment ’’ mea­sures.</p>

    <p>ated in con­sul­ta­tion with the in­dus­try. It is also aligned with in­ter­na­tional best prac­tices and takes into ac­count lessons learnt in the last few months.</p>
    <p>It will be tri­alled at the 2020 IEEE In­ter­na­tional Con­fer­ence on Com­pu­ta­tional Elec­tro­mag­net­ics from Aug 24 to 26, and the Asia Pa­cific MedTech Vir­tual Fo­rum 2020 on Sept 24.</p>
    <p>Both events will have on­line dis­cus­sions, which are ex­pected to draw a to­tal of about 1,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Mr Gabriel Sim, di­rec­tor of strategic part­ner­ships at APACMed, said it ex­pects hy­brid events to take off strongly.</p>
    <p>But phys­i­cal meet­ings con­tinue to be im­por­tant, he said, adding: “One of the key foun­da­tions of busi­ness events is the abil­ity for at­ten­dees to con­nect, net­work and ex­change views. Face-to-face meet­ings will re­main a crit­i­cal fea­ture... and this is un­likely to be re­placed fully by vir­tual el­e­ments.</p>
    <p>STB said the two events were se­lected as pi­lots be­cause their or­gan­is­ers have ac­tively en­gaged event venues and STB to ex­am­ine the safe man­age­ment mea­sures re­quired.</p>
    <p>STB added that it is work­ing with</p>
    <p>En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore and the Sin­ga­pore As­so­ci­a­tion of Con­ven­tion and Ex­hi­bi­tion Or­gan­is­ers and Sup­pli­ers to for­mu­late an In­dus­try Re­silience Road Map, to give the Mice (meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­fer­ences and ex­hi­bi­tions) sec­tor fur­ther guid­ance in plan­ning for re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>It will fo­cus on es­tab­lish­ing stan­dards for new event safety mea­sures, cre­at­ing ag­ile busi­ness models with a fo­cus on dig­i­tal ca­pa­bil­i­ties, and de­vel­op­ing path­ways for pro­fes­sional de­vel­op­ment in the world after Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said at a dia­logue yesterday that Sin­ga­pore will work with event or­gan­is­ers to have largescale events that can be bro­ken up into dif­fer­ent parts and com­bined through technology.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that the Mice in­dus­try forms a sig­nif­i­cant part of Sin­ga­pore’s in­bound travel, he added: “Our op­por­tu­nity is this – if we can do this well in Sin­ga­pore, we will then show the way for the rest of the in­dus­try in other parts of the world to come to­gether to work with us as well.”</p>
