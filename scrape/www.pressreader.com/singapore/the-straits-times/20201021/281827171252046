    <p>PARIS • France has un­leashed a broad crack­down on Mus­lims ac­cused of ex­trem­ism, car­ry­ing out dozens of raids, vow­ing to shut down aid groups and threat­en­ing to ex­pel for­eign­ers as anger swept the coun­try fol­low­ing the de­cap­i­ta­tion of a high-school teacher for show­ing car­i­ca­tures of Prophet Muham­mad in class.</p>
    <p>Many of those swept up in raids were al­ready in po­lice files for show­ing “sig­nals” of po­ten­tial rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion, such as preach­ing rad­i­calised ser­mons or shar­ing hate mes­sages on so­cial net­works, gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials said. Over 200 oth­ers – the bulk al­ready in prison – were threat­ened with a rare mass ex­pul­sion.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, the po­lice be­gan their work at 6am, go­ing af­ter “nu­mer­ous” Mus­lims in mul­ti­ple raids, hard­line In­te­rior Min­is­ter Ger­ald Dar­manin said.</p>
    <p>“Other ac­tions will fol­low”, Prime Min­is­ter Jean Cast ex said in a speech on Mon­day, against “net­works and in­di­vid­u­als who are at­tack­ing our ba­sic val­ues and the repub­li­can ideal”.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, 51 Mus­lim aid or­gan­i­sa­tions will be tar­geted by the po­lice this week, the In­te­rior Min­is­ter said, some of which would be dis­solved at Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron’s re­quest. By the day’s end, it was not clear how many ar­rests had re­sulted from the po­lice raids.</p>
    <p>The scope of the re­sponse was a mea­sure of how last Fri­day’s killing of Mr Sa­muel Paty, a teacher in a sub­urb north of Paris, had re­opened old wounds in France.</p>
    <p>The na­tion re­mains trau­ma­tised by ter­ror­ists at­tacks by Mus­lim ex­trem­ists that killed scores in 2015, start­ing with the edi­to­rial of­fices of the satir­i­cal Char­lie Hebdo mag­a­zine – whose car­toons the teacher had shown.</p>
    <p>A si­lent rally was planned yes­ter­day evening, as well as a cer­e­mony today at the Sor­bonne at­tended by Mr Macron.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic fig­ures called the lat­est killing an as­sault on the repub­lic and on French val­ues, and Mr Paty is to posthu­mously re­ceive France’s high­est award, the Le­gion d’Hon­neur.</p>
    <p>Among the 15 peo­ple de­tained so far were four stu­dents who may have helped the killer – an 18-yearold of Chechen ori­gin who was killed by po­lice – to iden­tify the teacher in re­turn for pay­ment.</p>
    <p>The killer, Ab­dul­lakh An­zorov, had been in con­tact with a par­ent who was lead­ing an on­line cam­paign against the teacher, po­lice sources said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>An­zorov had ex­changed mes­sages on What­sApp with the man, who wanted Mr Paty fired af­ter his daugh­ter told him how the teacher had shown car­toons of Prophet Muham­mad.</p>
    <p>The fa­ther, whose daugh­ter was a stu­dent of Mr Paty’s but was not in class at the time of the les­son, ac­cord­ing to po­lice sources, ac­cused the teacher of “pornog­ra­phy” for show­ing a car­toon of the Prophet naked.</p>
