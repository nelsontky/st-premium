    <p>Fans have waited two years for the sec­ond sea­son of A Dis­cov­ery Of Witches, a his­tor­i­cal fan­tasy se­ries that be­came a sleeper hit when it de­buted in 2018.</p>
    <p>Adapted from the in­ter­na­tion­ally best-sell­ing All Souls tril­ogy of nov­els by Deb­o­rah Hark­ness, the story be­gan with the dis­cov­ery of a be­witched man­u­script in an Ox­ford li­brary.</p>
    <p>Sea­son 2, which pre­mieres on Satur­day at 9pm on Fox Life (Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 301, StarHub TV Chan­nel 501), is based on the sec­ond novel, 2012’s Shadow Of Night.</p>
    <p>It com­bines mod­ern and pe­riod ele­ments as the char­ac­ters travel back in time to 16th-cen­tury Eng­land in their quest to pro­tect the man­u­script and learn its se­crets.</p>
    <p>Teresa Palmer reprises her role as Diana Bishop, a his­to­rian who dis­cov­ers the en­chanted text – and who also hap­pens to be a witch. Matthew Goode re­turns as Matthew Clair­mont, the sci­en­tist and vam­pire she falls in love with.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at an on­line panel for the show, which has a small but en­thu­si­as­tic fan base, Palmer and Goode say the story was dif­fi­cult to trans­late to the screen.</p>
    <p>And they be­came such fans of the books, they were dis­ap­pointed that parts of them had to be dropped.</p>
    <p>Palmer, the 34-year-old Aus­tralian star of the hor­ror films Lights Out (2016) and Warm Bod­ies (2013), says: “When you have very thick books filled with amaz­ing in­for­ma­tion, rich back­sto­ries and won­der­ful char­ac­ter arcs, it’s hard to adapt that for the screen be­cause you lose so much of that.”</p>
    <p>The tele­vi­sion show also loses a core el­e­ment of the nov­els, which is that they are told in Diana’s voice.</p>
    <p>“We don’t have any of that voiceover through the se­ries. So, I found there were mo­ments where I’d be dis­ap­pointed that cer­tain things were not be­ing kept in the show.”</p>
    <p>But Palmer ac­knowl­edges that is the way it goes with adap­ta­tions. “Some­times, you have to lose your dar­lings – the things you con­nected to in the books that don’t get to be in the show.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, the se­ries i ncor­po­rates so many beloved char­ac­ters from the nov­els that there is still plenty to en­joy.</p>
    <p>Goode, the 42-year-old English star of the ro­man­tic com­edy Leap Year (2010), says: “There are a lot of char­ac­ters to put in, so it’s in­cred­i­bly dif­fi­cult to adapt, but one of the great things is we have the force of a big team of ac­tors do­ing it.”</p>
    <p>And Hark­ness fans seem to have em­braced the show, per­haps be­cause the au­thor has been so in­ti­mately in­volved as a pro­ducer.</p>
    <p>Her pres­ence has been an in­valu­able re­source to the ac­tors, Palmer says.</p>
    <p>“There are so many par­al­lels be­tween her life and Diana’s. I can call her up and say, ‘What was she think­ing? What was her arc here and where does it come from?’ and just get be­neath the words.”</p>
    <p>Hark­ness, 55, an Amer­i­can scholar and pro­fes­sor of history, is not pre­cious about stick­ing pre­cisely to the orig­i­nal story and says the se­ries has added new di­men­sions to the tale.</p>
    <p>“In the nov­els, ev­ery­thing’s from Diana’s point of view, but the adap­ta­tion gave us the op­por­tu­nity to delve into what’s re­ally hap­pen­ing.</p>
    <p>“So, for me, it felt more true to the story in my head,” she says.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause as the writer of the nov­els, I had to know where ev­ery­body (in the story) was even if no­body else did. So, when I see the show, I feel like some­how you’ve been in my brain and you’ve seen what I got to see.”</p>
