    <p>WELLING­TON • New Zealand’s stock ex­change was halted for more than three hours yes­ter­day as it came un­der cy­ber at­tack for a sec­ond day.</p>
    <p>Ex­change op­er­a­tor NZX halted its cash mar­kets at 11.24am in Welling­ton and trad­ing did not re­sume un­til 3pm.</p>
    <p>It said in a brief state­ment that yes­ter­day’s is­sue was “sim­i­lar” to Tues­day’s cy­ber at­tack, which dis­rupted the fi­nal hour of trad­ing.</p>
    <p>The NZX web­site and feed of com­pany an­nounce­ments also went down, but have since been re­stored.</p>
    <p>“This is a very se­ri­ous at­tack on crit­i­cal in­fra­struc­ture in New Zealand,” said Dr Dave Parry, a pro­fes­sor of com­puter sci­ence at Auck­land Uni­ver­sity of Tech­nol­ogy. “The fact that this has hap­pened on a sec­ond day in­di­cates a level of so­phis­ti­ca­tion and de­ter­mi­na­tion which is rel­a­tively rare.”</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, NZX said trad­ing was dis­rupted by a “vol­u­met­ric dis­trib­uted de­nial of ser­vice at­tack from off­shore” – an at­tempt to dis­rupt ser­vice by sat­u­rat­ing a net­work with sig­nif­i­cant vol­umes of In­ter­net traf­fic. It was able to mit­i­gate the is­sue and the mar­ket be­gan as nor­mal at 10am yes­ter­day be­fore prices and in­dex up­dates were again halted.</p>
    <p>The S&P/NZX 50 bench­mark in­dex was near a record high when yes­ter­day’s in­ci­dent oc­curred. It was trad­ing at 11,995 points at 4.23pm, lit­tle changed from Tues­day’s close.</p>
    <p>There is no in­di­ca­tion yet as to who might have mounted the at­tack.</p>
