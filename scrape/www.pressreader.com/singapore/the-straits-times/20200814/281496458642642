    <p>Planned changes to bus ser­vices in Bukit Pan­jang will be amended, after the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA) and MPs dis­cussed ways to cush­ion the i mpact of these changes on com­muters.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties last week said four bus ser­vices ply­ing along the MRT Down­town Line (DTL) – which runs from Bukit Pan­jang to the Sin­ga­pore Expo – will ei­ther stop op­er­at­ing or be rerouted by Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The LTA had, in an­nounc­ing the changes and in seek­ing com­muters’ un­der­stand­ing ear­lier, cited the need for fi­nan­cial pru­dence, with rid­er­ship for these par­al­lel bus ser­vices fall­ing since the DTL be­gan op­er­at­ing in 2015.</p>
    <p>But three pub­lic pe­ti­tions i n quick suc­ces­sion, as well as the in­ter­ven­tion of Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Trans­port Chee Hong Tat</p>
    <p>CA­TER­ING TO DIF­FER­ENT GROUPS</p>
    <p>I seek ev­ery­one’s un­der­stand­ing that we need some give and take in such situations, to cater to dif­fer­ent groups of com­muters while en­sur­ing pru­dent use of pub­lic funds. ’’</p>
    <p>SE­NIOR MIN­IS­TER OF STATE FOR TRANS­PORT CHEE HONG TAT, on the need to reach a com­pro­mise.</p>
    <p>and other MPs, led to ne­go­ti­a­tions for ad­just­ments.</p>
    <p>Yesterday, Mr Chee and the MPs an­nounced on Face­book the com­pro­mise that they had reached.</p>
    <p>While bus ser­vices 700 and 700A will still be re­moved, routes of ex­ist­ing buses will be al­tered to plug the gap, en­sur­ing that res­i­dents in Pe­tir Road – one of the most af­fected by the changes – will still have a di­rect bus ser­vice to town dur­ing peak hours.</p>
    <p>Ser­vice 972, which links Bukit Pan­jang to Or­chard Road and was set to be rerouted to Newton MRT sta­tion, will also con­tinue to ply its old route so that fares and trav­el­ling time are un­af­fected.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a por­tion of ser­vice 972 buses will still be redi­rected to Scotts Road and Newton MRT sta­tion in a new ser­vice 972M, which could mean a longer wait time as there will be fewer buses for each ser­vice. Still, the agreed-upon mea­sures di­rectly ad­dressed the two main grouses of res­i­dents, namely the con­nec­tiv­ity be­tween Pe­tir Road and town, and the ad­di­tional trav­el­ling time that the rerout­ing of ser­vice 972 would have caused.</p>
    <p>With the cur­rent peak-hour ex­press ser­vice 971E con­verted to a peak-hour non-ex­press ser­vice 971, to link those in Pe­tir Road to the city, com­muters will also pay less and be brought closer to their des­ti­na­tions as there will be more stops.</p>
    <p>To al­low bus op­er­a­tors more time to pre­pare for the ad­just­ments, cur­rent bus routes will now con­tinue un­til Aug 30.</p>
    <p>Said Bukit Pan­jang MP Liang Eng Hwa: “Bukit Pan­jang Town has the ben­e­fit of the three modes of pub­lic trans­port to serve our res­i­dents and we in­tend to keep it that way.</p>
    <p>“Buses will re­main an es­sen­tial mode of trans­port for our res­i­dents and we will con­tinue to work with</p>
    <p>LTA to im­prove ser­vices.”</p>
    <p>LTA has also given as­sur­ances to MPs and res­i­dents that more buses will be added, if there is crowd­ing or long wait­ing times.</p>
    <p>Bukit Pan­jang res­i­dent El­liot Lin, who started one of the three pe­ti­tions, said he recog­nised the ef­fort that had gone into fi­nal­is­ing the so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the 35-year-old re­al­tor said that the new 972M ser­vice should also pass through Pe­tir Road so that res­i­dents there can still have a di­rect bus ser­vice to town dur­ing</p>
    <p>non-peak hours. “That would cut trav­el­ling time by about 15 min­utes. In­stead, we now have to take bus ser­vice 973 to the DTL sta­tion for a trans­fer,” he said. “It seems un­fair for peo­ple to be ex­cluded from more con­ve­nience to make up for the un­prof­itabil­ity of the DTL.”</p>
    <p>LTA has said that there will be more buses for ser­vice 973 to in­crease its fre­quency.</p>
    <p>Mr Chee and Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung had said ear­lier that the af­fected bus ser­vices and the DTL re­quire heavy gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies and that there is a need to ex­er­cise pru­dence in spend­ing pub­lic funds.</p>
    <p>Bus ser­vices 171 and 700 need $14 mil­lion in pub­lic funds an­nu­ally to keep run­ning, while about $60 mil­lion a year in pub­lic funds goes to­wards sub­si­dis­ing op­er­a­tions for a stretch of the DTL con­nect­ing Bukit Pan­jang to the city.</p>
    <p>Mr Chee said yesterday: “I seek ev­ery­one’s un­der­stand­ing that we need some give and take in such situations, to cater to dif­fer­ent groups of com­muters while en­sur­ing pru­dent use of pub­lic funds.”</p>
