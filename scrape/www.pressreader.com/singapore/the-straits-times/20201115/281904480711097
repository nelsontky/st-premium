    <p>The pandemic has put a damp­ener on Deep­avali for mi­grant work­ers but the spirit of the event was cel­e­brated when var­i­ous or­gan­i­sa­tions dis­trib­uted good­ies to about 168,000 res­i­dents across 144 dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>They also helped to pre-record prayers and greet­ings by the chief priests of var­i­ous Hindu tem­ples here and trans­mit­ted them to mi­grant work­ers via so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Work­ers in dorms were the worst af­fected when the pandemic hit here with tens of thou­sands in­fected. Many were placed in quar­an­tine or un­der lock­down and re­stric­tions were im­posed on what they could do on rest days.</p>
    <p>More than 1,000 vol­un­teers be­gan distribut­ing bags on Thurs­day in an ini­tia­tive or­gan­ised by the Min­istry of Man­power’s As­sur­ance, Care and En­gage­ment Group, the Hindu En­dow­ments Board and the Co­or­di­nat­ing Coun­cil of Sikh In­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo and Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Man­power Tan See Leng vis­ited work­ers at a fac­tory-con­verted dorm in Sungei Kadut yes­ter­day morn­ing to help dish out 580 goodie bags.</p>
    <p>In­dian na­tional Praba­ha­ran, a 33-year-old se­nior project co­or­di­na­tor who goes by one name, said he was sad that he could not go for his usual tem­ple visit this year but added: “I and my com­pany (are) ... very proud that the min­is­ter came out to cel­e­brate (with us).”</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said at the event: “Deep­avali is al­ways a cel­e­bra­tion of tri­umph of light over dark­ness and sym­bol­i­cally also sig­nals a very im­por­tant mile­stone in our jour­ney in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
    <p>“We want to thank very much the many mi­grant broth­ers – we know that many of them have weath­ered many storms dur­ing this jour­ney, and with­out their sup­port we re­ally could not have come this far.”</p>
    <p>The treats con­tin­ued i n the even­ing when 8,000 mi­grant work­ers in more than 70 fac­tory-con­verted dorms re­ceived a fes­tive meal of chicken briyani, In­dian sweets and mu­rukku.</p>
    <p>Mr Alvin Tan, the Min­is­ter of State for Trade and In­dus­try and Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth, helped out at P-Way Con­struc­tion and En­gi­neer­ing’s dorm in Tuas South, where about 200 work­ers tucked into the meals.</p>
    <p>The dis­tri­bu­tion was or­gan­ised by the Al­liance of Guest Work­ers Out­reach, an ini­tia­tive of Hope Ini­tia­tive Al­liance.</p>
    <p>Hope Ini­tia­tive Al­liance pres­i­dent Ezekiel Tan said: “We hope to bring (the work­ers) some cheer.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve, es­pe­cially on im­por­tant oc­ca­sions, there is a need to bring some kind of com­fort and as­sur­ance for their men­tal and re­li­gious well-be­ing.”</p>
