    <p>Per­haps the re­mark­able thing about last week’s Asean Min­is­te­rial Meet­ings that brought the 10 South-east Asian states to­gether with key in­ter­locu­tors in­clud­ing the United States, China and Ja­pan was that they were held at all. Covid-19 has af­flicted South-east Asia to var­i­ous de­grees – a health emer­gency that has pinned down al­ready slow­ing economies. All this has been com­pli­cated by the most dire geopo­lit­i­cal sit­u­a­tion of our time as the US con­fronts China, which, at the same time, also has se­ri­ous on­go­ing is­sues with sev­eral other fel­low mem­bers of the Asean Re­gional Fo­rum, in­clud­ing Asia’s other big mil­i­tary power, In­dia. To the credit of Viet­nam, the current Asean chair, it has broadly kept up the group­ing’s cal­en­dar amid these most un­usual cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>The lat­est meet­ing held ex­tra sig­nif­i­cance since Wash­ing­ton mod­i­fied its po­si­tion on the South China Sea in July, as­sert­ing that all of China’s claims out­side its in­ter­na­tion­ally recog­nised wa­ters were il­le­gal. Against this back­ground, to hope for balm on the many fes­ter­ing geopo­lit­i­cal dis­putes would have been wish­ful think­ing. Not un­ex­pect­edly, the US-China ex­changes were ro­bustly forth­right to the ex­tent that set-piece speeches could be. Per­haps it was for­tu­nate that the in­ter­locu­tors were meet­ing vir­tu­ally and not face to face. With­out com­pro­mis­ing essen­tial in­ter­ests – Asean mem­ber-states with claims to the South China Sea needed to state their po­si­tions – they seem to have suc­cess­fully avoided tak­ing sides in the larger geopo­lit­i­cal dis­pute.</p>
    <p>It was not missed that Asean, this time, came out with an agreed joint com­mu­nique rather than a mere chair­man’s state­ment. This doc­u­ment, run­ning into 28 pages, makes clear that up­per­most on Asean’s col­lec­tive mind is the chal­lenge of tack­ling the Covid-19 pan­demic. In its own way, by cut­ting across sev­eral tracks from health to sup­ply chains, the virus is in­flu­enc­ing the group. Asean’s abil­ity to adopt a co­he­sive and col­lec­tive re­sponse to the health chal­lenge and sus­tain growth is key to com­mu­nity build­ing, the very heart of the Asean project. The think­ing has long been: big na­tion or small, we sink or swim to­gether.</p>
    <p>But much work lies ahead. There is the is­sue of vac­cine mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism – en­sur­ing that an ef­fec­tive vac­cine, once dis­cov­ered, is avail­able across the re­gion and ac­ces­si­ble to all re­gard­less of so­cial strata. The other is the press­ing need to re­open travel amid Covid-19. Some bi­lat­eral ar­range­ments for this are al­ready in place and more are tak­ing shape, but Asean needs to start con­sid­er­ing travel ar­range­ments as a bloc. Travel is essen­tial to re­open­ing economies. Equally so is trade. For this rea­son, it pro­vides wel­come re­lief that min­is­ters agreed that the 15-na­tion Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship, a trade pact that groups economies ac­count­ing for nearly a third of global gross domestic prod­uct, will be signed this year.</p>
