    <p>While re­count­ing the con­stant beat­ing, kick­ing and ver­bal abuse she al­legedly suf­fered for years while train­ing in China, for­mer na­tional fig­ure skater Yu Shuran spoke in tones so mea­sured that one could al­most miss the un­der­cur­rent of anger be­hind her words.</p>
    <p>Be­ing hit by her coach re­peat­edly with a plas­tic blade guard till her skin was raw. Get­ting kicked by the toe-pick of her coach’s blade – the small, jagged edges at the front of the blade – and hav­ing to con­tinue prac­tice de­spite bleed­ing. Be­ing driven to a se­cluded area dur­ing an over­seas train­ing camp, then get­ting dragged out of the car for a beat­ing as pun­ish­ment for a bad prac­tice ses­sion.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know if there’s one worst in­ci­dent be­cause it just shouldn’t be hap­pen­ing in the first place... there were some in­ci­dents that were worse than oth­ers,” the 19-year-old told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“But the fact that it hap­pened over the course of a few years and there were a few years where I was con­stantly scared to get on the ice, I think that might be the worst part be­cause it’s so sys­temic.”</p>
    <p>The 2017 SEA Games cham­pion, who was born and raised in Bei­jing by a Chi­nese mother and a Sin­ga­porean father, was speak­ing to this news­pa­per via video con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>She opened up about the abuse she suf­fered while train­ing in China on Wed­nes­day via Instagram, re­veal­ing in her post that the phys­i­cal abuse started when she was 11 years old.</p>
    <p>At age 13, she re­called feel­ing “so burnt out” and com­ing close to quit­ting be­cause be­ing on the ice “just wasn’t en­joy­able any more”.</p>
    <p>Yu, who re­tired in 2018 ow­ing to ill­ness, told ST: “Know­ing all of this now, that shouldn’t come as a sur­prise be­cause why would it be en­joy­able when I’m lit­er­ally be­ing yelled at, cursed at, in­sulted and at­tacked all the time?”</p>
    <p>Those at the rink wit­nessed the abuse, she said, adding that some par­ents had jus­ti­fied the coach’s ac­tions by telling her that he “cares about your re­sults” and “he thinks you have po­ten­tial”.</p>
    <p>She added: “There’s al­most this val­i­da­tion that peo­ple try to at­tach to it for me. I didn’t agree with that but at the same time, it got to my head in the sense that if ev­ery­one’s see­ing this and no one’s do­ing any­thing about it, how wrong is it?”</p>
    <p>The abuse “less­ened by a lot” around the time she turned 16, re­called Yu, and that was when she re­gained her love for the sport.</p>
    <p>“How I got through the tougher parts (of the abuse) was just to numb it out... maybe it was a method while I was com­pet­ing, but I re­alised it’s not good to just go through your teenage years numb,” said Yu, who in 2017 was Sin­ga­pore’s first fig­ure skater to qual­ify for the In­ter­na­tional Skat­ing Union World Fig­ure Skat­ing Cham­pi­onships. “Right now I’m pro­cess­ing things for the first time and, what­ever I ‘numbed out’ be­fore, I still have to process now.”</p>
    <p>The “pro­cess­ing” started when she read Amer­i­can Olympic cham­pion gym­nast Laurie Her­nan­dez’s pub­lic ac­count of how she was ver­bally and emo­tion­ally abused by her for­mer coach Mag­gie Haney.</p>
    <p>Yu said: “I feel re­ally bad but it just shows how messed up it is that the first thing I (thought) af­ter read­ing it was, ‘That’s not that bad.’</p>
    <p>“That just goes to show how in­sanely in­ter­nalised and nor­malised that had be­come for me, be­cause I res­onated with every sin­gle part of her story... I didn’t even know the ver­bal and emo­tional stuff could be con­sid­ered abuse.”</p>
    <p>Her de­ci­sion to speak out was also in part driven by Ath­lete A, the Net­flix doc­u­men­tary de­tail­ing for­mer USA Gym­nas­tics doc­tor Larry Nas­sar’s abuse of the girls and young women un­der his care, and sev­eral elite Bri­tish gym­nasts’ al­le­ga­tions of phys­i­cal and emo­tional abuse.</p>
    <p>Since go­ing pub­lic with her ac­count, Yu has re­ceived mes­sages from other ath­letes in and out­side skat­ing about how they can re­late to her story.</p>
    <p>“It’s so dis­ap­point­ing be­cause you don’t want any­one to be able to re­late to that and you can’t find joy in that,” she said.</p>
    <p>“But, at the same time, it high­lights that it’s a much big­ger prob­lem than we ever re­alised.</p>
    <p>“Skat­ing is a very en­joy­able thing and yes, it’s a very dif­fi­cult sport and it re­quires sac­ri­fice and hard work. But that should al­ways be re­ward­ing and not in a way that’s done to make the ath­lete feel mis­er­able.”</p>
    <p>Urg­ing na­tional govern­ing bodies around the world to re-eval­u­ate their poli­cies and ques­tion if they are do­ing enough to pre­vent and treat abuse cases, she added: “There needs to be ed­u­ca­tion done for coaches around the world about how abuse just isn’t a valid method.</p>
    <p>“There has to be a sen­ti­ment, where we want to pro­tect the child at all costs and I say child very de­lib­er­ately be­cause so of­ten we’re not treated as chil­dren, when we are. We’re treated as ro­bots and ma­chines that are pro­duced to get re­sults, and then dis­carded af­ter we’re</p>
    <p>IN A BLUR</p>
    <p>I didn’t agree with that but at the same time, it got to my head in the sense that if ev­ery­one’s see­ing this and no one’s do­ing any­thing about it, how wrong is it?</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>YU SHURAN, for­mer fig­ure skater, on how some peo­ple tried to ra­tio­nalise coaches’ abuse as part of train­ing and de­vel­op­ment. HU­MANS, NOT MA­CHINES</p>
    <p>Peo­ple ab­so­lutely have to start see­ing ath­letes as chil­dren and even if they’re legally adults, they’re peo­ple, not ro­bots. ’’</p>

    <p>“Peo­ple ab­so­lutely have to start see­ing ath­letes as chil­dren and even if they’re legally adults, they’re peo­ple, not ro­bots.”</p>
    <p>While she had re­mained si­lent early on, she has pledged to speak up about the mat­ter now in or­der to con­tinue shed­ding light on the is­sue.</p>
    <p>“I was si­lent for a long time and right now, I don’t in­tend on be­ing any­thing but loud about this, be­cause if I’m not loud about it... this is­sue over­all will still be ig­nored,” she said.</p>
