    <p>Asec­tion of power ca­ble that was burned through and a faulty cir­cuit breaker along the Tuas West Ex­ten­sion were the pri­mary causes of a mas­sive dis­rup­tion that af­fected three MRT lines on Oct 14. The 3hr 36min in­ci­dent af­fected 123,000 com­muters. Of th­ese, 6,500 com­muters were on 12 stalled trains along the North-South and EastWest lines, while 275 were on three stalled Cir­cle Line trains. It is re­as­sur­ing to learn that all elec­tri­cal power ca­bles along the Tuas West Ex­ten­sion will now be re­placed. This move recog­nises the mag­ni­tude of a tech­ni­cal glitch that could af­flict three lines and leave thou­sands of pas­sen­gers stuck on trains for up to three hours.</p>
    <p>In a joint brief­ing with rail op­er­a­tor SMRT and sys­tems sup­plier Al­stom, the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity said the French com­pany will re­place some 150km of ca­bles which sup­ply power to trains by the end of next year. The re­place­ment ca­bles will have tougher in­su­la­tion. Al­stom will also re­place all 113 trip coils – core com­po­nents of cir­cuit break­ers – along the three-year-old west­ern stretch of the East-West Line by the end of this year. The com­pany will do so at its own cost, thus recog­nis­ing its re­spon­si­bil­ity to SMRT and, ul­ti­mately, to pas­sen­gers. This would pro­vide some com­fort to those af­fected by the break­down and to the trav­el­ling public at large, which ex­pects ac­count­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>The tech­ni­cal prob­lem was wors­ened by hu­man er­ror. Hence, two em­ploy­ees – a su­per­vi­sor and a staff mem­ber – who had mis­read equip­ment at a sub­sta­tion, have been sus­pended and will have to un­dergo re­train­ing and re­cer­ti­fi­ca­tion be­fore they can re­sume their du­ties. This sanc­tion should alert other SMRT em­ploy­ees, par­tic­u­larly those en­gaged in cru­cial tech­ni­cal jobs, to the crit­i­cal ne­ces­sity of possessing both the knowl­edge and pres­ence of mind to en­sure the proper func­tion­ing of the sys­tem. Since no sys­tem is tested more than in a cri­sis, they should be skilled enough to know what to do when things go wrong. SMRT should in­cul­cate a sharper cul­ture of emer­gency think­ing in its ranks.</p>
    <p>Com­muters do un­der­stand that no sys­tem can be per­fect. SMRT faces a chal­lenge com­mon to all ex­pand­ing en­ti­ties: how to pre­serve ex­ist­ing stan­dards of re­li­a­bil­ity even while the ser­vice net­work widens. Equip­ment grows old, hu­man re­sources are stretched, and cus­tomers de­mand the best of what they en­joy although they are promised more.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Sin­ga­pore’s trans­port sys­tem nat­u­rally is held up to high so­cial stan­dards in a coun­try that prizes it­self on the qual­ity of the ser­vice it pro­vides to com­muters. SMRT has come a long way since the mul­ti­ple train break­downs of al­most a decade ago caused a cri­sis of con­fi­dence in the work­ings of an ef­fi­cient sys­tem. It must keep mov­ing for­ward.</p>
