    <p>Free­ing up more time to fo­cus on skills like crit­i­cal think­ing “by not plac­ing con­tent on too high a pedestal” al­lows stu­dents time to de­velop more an­a­lyt­i­cal abil­i­ties that will ben­e­fit them in the work­ing world. “The con­tent in a cer­tain subject area might change dras­ti­cally down the road, but it’s un­likely that the skills will,” said Mr Koh Wein­ing, head of Te­masek Ju­nior Col­lege’s hu­man­i­ties de­part­ment.</p>
    <p>With a mix of on­line and in-per­son les­sons, Mr Hen­dri Adri­adi Rizal has found more op­por­tu­ni­ties to get his stu­dents en­gaged in mean­ing­ful de­bates.</p>
    <p>And more de­bates of that kind, which are con­cep­tu­ally deeper, are made pos­si­ble when stu­dents have picked up a base level of knowl­edge at home be­fore class as part of blended learn­ing, said the se­nior history teacher at Te­masek Ju­nior Col­lege (TJC) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>TJC has been ex­per­i­ment­ing with blended learn­ing since 2018, a tech­nique that in­te­grates on­line and face-to-face teach­ing.</p>
    <p>A key strat­egy em­ployed at TJC is “flipped” learn­ing – the stu­dents first study the les­son con­tent and take sim­ple quizzes on an on­line por­tal, and then at­tend class where fur­ther clarificat­ions on the subject mat­ter can be made.</p>
    <p>This is a re­ver­sal from the tra­di­tional way of learn­ing where stu­dents learn con­tent in school and then ap­ply it after class when com­plet­ing home­work as­sign­ments.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, TJC’s subject head for Chi­nese, Ms Cai Jun Jun, said stu­dents may watch a recorded les­son on let­ter writ­ing be­fore ap­ply­ing this skill with a teacher’s guid­ance in class, al­low­ing them to have a clearer pic­ture of what let­ter writ­ing en­tails be­fore they em­bark on it.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh Wein­ing, head of TJC’s hu­man­i­ties de­part­ment, said the “flipped” model has changed the role teach­ers play.</p>
    <p>“We have to fa­cil­i­tate (learn­ing) a lot more dur­ing face-to-face les­sons rather than teach con­tent, so we are no longer ‘the sages on the stage’, where we just lec­ture,” said Mr Koh.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents are also en­cour­aged to learn more in­de­pen­dently when en­gag­ing in home-based learn­ing, he said.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, they are given short quizzes at the end of each seg­ment dur­ing e-les­sons, and can re­play them if they get the an­swers wrong or to clear up mis­un­der­stand­ings. Their teacher’s feed­back also ap­pears on screen when wrong an­swers are se­lected.</p>
    <p>These meth­ods have en­hanced stu­dents’ mo­ti­va­tion and al­lowed them to master sub­jects better, said Mr Koh, based on feed­back and test scores col­lated by the school and the qual­ity of stu­dents’ ques­tions.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, the teach­ers hope blended learn­ing, which Education Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said yes­ter­day will be im­ple­mented at se­condary schools and ju­nior col­leges from next year, will allow stu­dents to pick up skills for use be­yond school, such as a cu­rios­ity for the world or a sense of ac­count­abil­ity and own­er­ship over learn­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh said free­ing up more time to fo­cus on skills like crit­i­cal think­ing “by not plac­ing con­tent on too high a pedestal” al­lows stu­dents time to de­velop more an­a­lyt­i­cal abil­i­ties that will ben­e­fit them in the work­ing world. “The con­tent in a cer­tain subject area might change dras­ti­cally down the road, but it’s un­likely that the skills will.”</p>
