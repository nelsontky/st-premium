    <p>Kep­pel Cor­po­ra­tion’s third quar­ter net profit fell to “sig­nif­i­cantly lower” lev­els from the same pe­riod a year ago, as it emerges from a $697 mil­lion net loss in the pre­ced­ing quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the main­board-listed con­glom­er­ate re­ported that de­spite swing­ing back into the black this quar­ter, it was still loss-mak­ing for the first nine months of this year due to $919 mil­lion of sig­nif­i­cant im­pair­ments recorded in the se­cond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue for the nine months was at $4.8 bil­lion, down 10.5 per cent year on year from $5.4 bil­lion, fol­low­ing de­creased con­tri­bu­tions from Kep­pel Off­shore & Ma­rine (O&M).</p>
    <p>The group’s net gear­ing was lower at 0.96x as at Sept 30, com­pared with 1.00x in the se­cond quar­ter. This was mainly due to lower work­ing cap­i­tal re­quire­ments, it said. In the year to date, the group has raised more than $3 bil­lion in loans and com­mit­ted bank fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Kep­pel’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Loh Chin Hua said: “Kep­pel’s key busi­nesses have per­formed re­siliently in the third quar­ter of 2020, with all key busi­ness units re­main­ing prof­itable, ex­cept for Kep­pel O&M which con­tin­ues to face very chal­leng­ing con­di­tions due to both the down­turn in the sec­tor and the re­duced top line re­sult­ing from the Covid-19 pan­demic and mea­sures to con­tain its spread.”</p>
    <p>The off­shore and ma­rine arm’s Q3 net loss comes on the back of con­tin­ued dis­rup­tions re­lated to Covid-19, de­spite a grad­ual re­turn of its work­force, it said. “Kep­pel O&M will con­tinue to face chal­lenges in its prof­itabil­ity for the rest of the year as the in­dus­try con­tin­ues to face head­winds amidst de­pressed oil prices.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, its pivot into other mar­ket seg­ments is “bear­ing fruit”, it added. In the year to date, Kep­pel O&M has se­cured about $900 mil­lion worth of new con­tracts, of which off­shore re­new­ables and gas-re­lated projects com­prise about 72 per cent.</p>
    <p>As at Sept 30, Kep­pel O&M’s net or­der book stood at $4.1 bil­lion, up from $3.5 bil­lion as at end-June.</p>
    <p>Since the start of the pan­demic, Kep­pel O&M has put in place cost man­age­ment mea­sures, which will re­sult in re­duc­tion in an­nual over­head costs of more than $90 mil­lion start­ing from next year, and is work­ing on fur­ther cost re­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>Kep­pel In­fras­truc­ture, on the other hand, con­tin­ued to per­form re­siliently and recorded earn­ings be­fore in­ter­est, taxes, de­pre­ci­a­tion, and amor­ti­sa­tion (Ebitda) of $119 mil­lion for the first nine months of this year, slightly above the $115 mil­lion a year ago.</p>
    <p>In the year to date, Kep­pel In­fras­truc­ture has se­cured $2.1 bil­lion worth of waste-to-en­ergy and dis­trict cool­ing con­tracts across Sin­ga­pore, In­dia and Thai­land.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Kep­pel Land sold about 2,030 homes in the first nine months of this year, a drop from 3,520 homes sold in the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Kep­pel Telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions & Trans­porta­tion’s (T&T) new data cen­tre project in part­ner­ship with Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings has met with “strong de­mand from both ex­ist­ing as well as new cus­tomers”; M1, in which the con­glom­er­ate’s T&T arm owns a stake, main­tained a “sta­ble” Ebitda of $202 mil­lion for the first nine months.</p>
    <p>Kep­pel Corp shares closed seven Sin­ga­pore cents, or 1.61 per cent, lower at $4.27 yes­ter­day.</p>
