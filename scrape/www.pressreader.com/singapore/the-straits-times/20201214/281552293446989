    <p>The hands-on man­age­ment style that In­done­sian Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo’s son Gi­bran Rak­abum­ing Raka (right) learnt from his fa­ther has worked its charms on the res­i­dents of Solo city in Cen­tral Java, where Mr Gi­bran is set to be­come its mayor. His quiet, dili­gent de­meanour is ex­pected to see him through his new role.</p>
    <p>With his quiet de­meanour and terse pub­lic re­marks, Mr Gi­bran Rak­abum­ing Raka of­ten ap­pears cold and aloof, but to the res­i­dents of Solo city in Cen­tral Java, their mayor-to-be is nowhere near stand-off­ish.</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old, who is Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo’s son, lis­tens to their com­plaints, from choked drains to leaky roofs.</p>
    <p>No job seems too small or dirty – he once helped clean a filthy canal in a neigh­bour­hood dur­ing an im­promptu visit.</p>
    <p>The hands-on man­age­ment style that he learnt from his fa­ther – who was the city’s mayor from 2005 to 2012 – has cer­tainly worked its charms on res­i­dents, who over­whelm­ingly voted for him in the Dec 9 re­gional elec­tions.</p>
    <p>“As the son of the pres­i­dent, he leads a priv­i­leged life. Yet, he’s still will­ing to go to the ground and meet or­di­nary peo­ple. He has done this con­sis­tently for more than a year... it’s not penci­traan, it’s more than that,” cam­paign vol­un­teer Guntur Wahyu Nugroho, 42, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“Penci­traan” in Ba­hasa In­done­sia means “build­ing a good im­age”, but in In­done­sian pol­i­tics, it is of­ten used to de­scribe pre­ten­tious politi­cians seek­ing praise.</p>
    <p>“Per­son­ally I think we need this kind of leader: young, will­ing to hear and learn,” added Mr Guntur.</p>
    <p>To him, Mr Gi­bran is de­ter­mined, com­mit­ted to his causes, and en­thu­si­as­tic to learn new things, in­clud­ing pol­i­tics which he had shown lit­tle in­ter­est in un­til about a year ago.</p>
    <p>This gave rise to spec­u­la­tion that Pres­i­dent Joko, pop­u­larly known as Jokowi, wanted to build a po­lit­i­cal dynasty, ru­mours ve­he­mently de­nied by Mr Gi­bran as he strug­gled to step out from the shadow of his fa­ther.</p>
    <p>“I am tak­ing part in the race and I can win or lose. Peo­ple can vote for me or not and there’s no obli­ga­tion to choose me. It is a con­test, not ap­point­ment,” he said in July.</p>
    <p>Team­ing up with vet­eran politi­cian Teguh Prakosa as his deputy in the may­oral race, Mr Gi­bran was backed by five par­ties with seats in the lo­cal Par­lia­ment – in­clud­ing Mr Joko’s In­done­sian Demo­cratic Party of Strug­gle, Golkar and Gerindra. They ef­fort­lessly de</p>
    <p>NOT PRE­TEN­TIOUS</p>
    <p>feated tailor Bagyo Wahy­ono and his run­ning mate FX Su­pardjo, both in­de­pen­dents.</p>
    <p>Mr Gi­bran stud­ied at Sin­ga­pore’s Or­chid Park Sec­ondary School and Man­age­ment De­vel­op­ment In­sti­tute of Sin­ga­pore, be­fore en­ter­ing the Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy Syd­ney Insearch.</p>
    <p>Af­ter re­turn­ing to In­done­sia, he set up a cater­ing busi­ness at 23, re­fus­ing to take over his fa­ther’s fur­ni­ture busi­ness.</p>
    <p>He sold lo­cal snacks and drinks with a West­ern twist, from sweet pan­cakes topped with Nutella choco­late and cheese, to tra­di­tional drinks such as iced green bean pack­aged like bub­ble tea.</p>
    <p>So far, he has at least eight busi­nesses to his name, amass­ing a tidy for­tune to­talling 21.15 bil­lion ru­piah (over S$2 mil­lion). But like his fa­ther, Mr Gi­bran lives mod­estly. He of­ten flew on econ­omy class to do­mes­tic and over­seas des­ti­na­tions and with­out se­cu­rity guards.</p>
    <p>He is mar­ried to Solo beauty queen Selvi Ananda and they have two chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Mr Gi­bran’s ca­pa­bil­ity was ini­tially doubted by some res­i­dents who thought he was an easy shooin by the po­lit­i­cal elites.</p>
    <p>But Solo res­i­dent Is Hariyanto said he be­came con­vinced about vot­ing for Mr Gi­bran af­ter closely study­ing his de­vel­op­ment pro­grammes for Solo and lis­ten­ing to his speeches. “He was will­ing to work hard. By meet­ing peo­ple on the ground, he knew prob­lems that res­i­dents faced, is­sues in ev­ery sin­gle kam­pung,” he added.</p>
    <p>As the son of the pres­i­dent, he leads a priv­i­leged life. Yet, he’s still will­ing to go to the ground and meet or­di­nary peo­ple. He has done this con­sis­tently for more than a year... it’s not penci­traan, it’s more than that.</p>
