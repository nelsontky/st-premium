    <p>LIS­BON • Ney­mar is where he en­vi­sioned him­self to be when he left Barcelona in 2017, in a Cham­pi­ons League fi­nal as the leader of a Paris Saint-Ger­main team, out of Lionel Messi’s shadow and a stage to show that in Lis­bon to­day.</p>
    <p>Bay­ern Mu­nich striker Robert Le­wandowski is also ea­ger to prove that he is the world’s best player when the su­per­stars col­lide to­day.</p>
    <p>Un­like Ney­mar, the Cham­pi­ons League re­mains miss­ing from the Pole’s re­sume. He was in the de­feated Dort­mund team in the 2013 fi­nal against Bay­ern, the fifth and last time the Bavar­ian gi­ants won Europe’s elite club com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>Four sur­vivors of the 2013 tre­blewin­ning team – Manuel Neuer, Jerome Boateng, David Alaba and Thomas Muller – are likely to start, with Le­wandowski set to be the main goal threat. He is in the form of his life and just two short of Cris­tiano Ron­aldo’s record of 17 goals in a Cham­pi­ons League sea­son.</p>
    <p>His clin­i­cally headed goal to seal Wednes­day’s 3-0 semi-fi­nal win over Lyon – his 55th in all com­pe­ti­tions this sea­son – meant he has scored in all nine games he has played in this term’s Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>“I think for every player the Cham­pi­ons League is the big goal,” said Le­wandowski, who turned 32 on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Muller, whose record 21 as­sists in the Bun­desliga last sea­son helped con­trib­ute to Le­wandowski’s 34 league goals this sea­son, said about his team­mate: “His goals are what makes him fa­mous world­wide, but he is very team-ori­ented, that’s why we’re strong at the mo­ment.”</p>
    <p>Bay­ern will ar­rive at Es­ta­dio da Luz on a 20-match win­ning streak in com­pet­i­tive games while PSG are on an im­pres­sive run of their own.</p>
    <p>The French cham­pi­ons have scored in 34 straight matches in ma­jor Euro­pean com­pe­ti­tions – equal with Real Madrid in the Cham­pi­ons League – from 2011 to 2014.</p>
    <p>Cru­cially for the first-time fi­nal­ists, Ney­mar does not have their men­tal scars from this com­pe­ti­tion as in­juries forced him to miss their most re­cent last-16 de­feats by Real Madrid and Manch­ester United.</p>
    <p>The Brazil­ian for­ward has also evolved this sea­son. In at­tack, he does not try to take on de­fences alone. When PSG do not have the ball, the 28-year-old has put in de­fen­sive shifts, press­ing op­po­nents from the front.</p>
    <p>“I see him as de­ter­mined to take PSG to the top,” PSG mid­fielder Marco Ver­ratti told Gazzetta dello</p>
    <p>Sport. “Hav­ing him in this phys­i­cal and men­tal con­di­tion is an added bonus. Ney­mar is a leader who al­ways plays and trains hard, an ex­am­ple to us all.”</p>
    <p>All that is left for the Brazil­ian is to lead his team­mates to the tro­phy he was brought to Paris for.</p>
