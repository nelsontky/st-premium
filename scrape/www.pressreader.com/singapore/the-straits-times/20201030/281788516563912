    <p>Trav­ellers in China were muted in their re­sponse to the lift­ing of Sin­ga­pore travel re­stric­tions, with many cit­ing the need for a twoweek quar­an­tine upon their re­turn as the main in­con­ve­nience.</p>
    <p>Be­gin­ning next Fri­day, trav­ellers from Vic­to­ria, Aus­tralia, and China with neg­a­tive Covid-19 tests will be able to en­ter Sin­ga­pore with­out the need for a quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>But this has not been re­cip­ro­cated by Can­berra and Bei­jing, which are still keep­ing their bor­ders shut with cer­tain ex­cep­tions.</p>
    <p>China closed its bor­ders to all for­eign­ers on March 28, in­clud­ing those with long-term visas.</p>
    <p>Con­trols were grad­u­ally eased from late April when it an­nounced a “fast track” agree­ment with South Korea, al­low­ing quar­an­tine-free travel in ur­gent and es­sen­tial cases. A sim­i­lar ar­range­ment was an­nounced with Sin­ga­pore on May 28.</p>
    <p>From Sept 28, this was fur­ther re­laxed to al­low for­eign­ers hold­ing visas for work, per­sonal matters and fam­ily re­unions to re-en­ter the coun­try. But all ar­rivals would have to un­dergo a 14-day quar­an­tine at a gov­ern­ment fa­cil­ity at their own ex­pense.</p>
    <p>For me­dia ex­ec­u­tive Bao Hongguang, it would be a good op­por­tu­nity, if the Sin­ga­pore move came ear­lier, to visit his 17-year-old daugh­ter who is at­tend­ing a Sin­ga­pore sec­ondary school.</p>
    <p>His plan to visit was thrice resched­uled be­cause of the pan­demic, and he has now pen­cilled it in for March next year.</p>
    <p>“The eas­ing of quar­an­tine mea­sures would have been help­ful, but my daugh­ter is fin­ish­ing her O lev­els this week and will be com­ing back in Novem­ber, so there is no point. It is the same for my other friends with chil­dren in Sin­ga­pore,” he said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Even if I went, I would have to quar­an­tine when I come back, and I don’t have that much time off.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a study com­mis­sioned by the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board in June, Chi­nese trav­ellers pri­ori­tise hav­ing no quar­an­tine upon re­turn, the avail­abil­ity of treat­ment and vac­cines, and no new cases in their des­ti­na­tion coun­try as cri­te­ria for trav­el­ling.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers like Sin­ga­porean busi­ness­man Ric Koh said the new mea­sures do not make much of a dif­fer­ence to them. The Shen­zhen-based founder of an elec­tron­ics man­u­fac­tur­ing firm said he could al­ways come back to Sin­ga­pore but had held back be­cause the pa­per­work for sub­se­quent re­turn to China is “com­pli­cated”.</p>
    <p>“I wouldn’t mind go­ing through nu­cleic acid tests ev­ery day, or even tak­ing the vac­cine at an ex­per­i­men­tal stage just so I can travel freely for work,” Mr Koh added.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Aus­tralia has also not re­cip­ro­cated Sin­ga­pore’s eas­ing of travel re­stric­tions and con­tin­ues to bar en­try to non-cit­i­zens and non-res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Al­most all in­ter­na­tional ar­rivals in Aus­tralia must un­dergo 14 days of quar­an­tine, typ­i­cally at the trav­eller’s own ex­pense. And Aus­tralians are barred from trav­el­ling over­seas un­less they get an ex­emp­tion from the fed­eral gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son has said that the gov­ern­ment is con­sid­er­ing cre­at­ing travel bub­bles with Sin­ga­pore, South Korea, Ja­pan and Pa­cific is­land na­tions.</p>
    <p>So far, Aus­tralia’s only travel bub­ble is with New Zealand. Even then, only select Aus­tralian re­gions have agreed to be part of it.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s de­ci­sion to ac­cept trav­ellers from Vic­to­ria could add to pres­sure on Aus­tralian states and ter­ri­to­ries which have yet to open their own doors to Vic­to­rian vis­i­tors. New South Wales pre­mier Gla­dys Bere­jik­lian said yes­ter­day she will con­sider open­ing the bor­der with Vic­to­ria in the com­ing weeks, af­ter it be­comes clear that Vic­to­ria’s eas­ing of curbs will not lead to more cases.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria’s gov­ern­ment could not be reached for com­ment last night about Sin­ga­pore’s de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>NOT A DE­CID­ING FAC­TOR</p>
    <p>The eas­ing of quar­an­tine mea­sures would have been help­ful, but my daugh­ter is fin­ish­ing her O lev­els this week and will be com­ing back in Novem­ber, so there is no point. It is the same for my other friends with chil­dren in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>ME­DIA EX­EC­U­TIVE BAO HONGGUANG, who would have taken the chance to visit his daugh­ter here if the move had come ear­lier.</p>
