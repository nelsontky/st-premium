    <p>The prospect of Mr Joe Bi­den in the White House has eased Ja­pan’s wor­ries over their se­cu­rity al­liance but there are rip­ples of trep­i­da­tion that the United States may be­come more con­cil­ia­tory to­wards China.</p>
    <p>Tokyo suf­fered fours years of ap­pre­hen­sion as Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump took a trans­ac­tional view of their de­fence treaty, and his im­pend­ing de­par­ture has stirred ex­pec­ta­tions of a likely re­turn of the US to mul­ti­lat­eral in­sti­tu­tions and greater re­spect be­ing shown to bi­lat­eral al­liances.</p>
    <p>But there is a silent mi­nor­ity which sees Mr Trump as bet­ter for the re­gion, given his hard­line pos­ture to­wards China. This con­ser­va­tive sec­tion thinks the en­gage­ment pol­icy pur­sued by for­mer US pres­i­dent Barack Obama, un­der whom Mr Bi­den served as vi­cepres­i­dent, was a dis­as­ter.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing dis­cus­sions with for­mer diplo­mats, Dr Ki­ichi Fu­ji­wara, who teaches in­ter­na­tional pol­i­tics at Univer­sity of Tokyo, says: “Fac­ing China’s rise is a high pri­or­ity for Ja­pan and there is a fear of a re­turn to an Obama-era pol­icy of en­gage­ment. Trump is tough and un­pre­dictable but some be­lieve that a mad man is bet­ter than a soft guy.”</p>
    <p>Still, there is hope that even as Mr Bi­den moves to mend ties with Bei­jing, he will put more faith in the US’ al­liance with Tokyo.</p>
    <p>Dr Fu­ji­wara adds: “Bi­den’s ap­proach to China would be, in many ways, just as hard­line but the key dif­fer­ence is that he would try to mo­bilise sup­port from al­lies.”</p>
    <p>In part em­bold­ened by a more hawk­ish Wash­ing­ton, Ja­pan has pur­sued tougher poli­cies against China. Tokyo has, in its re­cent an­nual de­fence re­views, cited China as a greater se­cu­rity threat than North Korea.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan will ef­fec­tively ban the pro­cure­ment of Chi­nese-made drones for de­fence and in­fra­struc­ture sur­veil­lance from next year, the Nikkei re­ported ear­lier this week.</p>
    <p>It will also tighten in­spec­tion pro­ce­dures in is­su­ing visas for Chi­nese stu­dents and re­searchers over for­eign in­ter­fer­ence fears, the Yomi­uri re­ported last month.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, given how in­ex­orably linked the Chi­nese and Ja­panese economies have be­come, Tokyo can­not af­ford to en­tirely de­cou­ple from a coun­try it views as its great­est se­cu­rity threat.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan is also hedg­ing, with the re­al­i­sa­tion that, as an Asahi Shim­bun ed­i­to­rial puts it, “an over-re­liance on one ma­jor power is not a wise strat­egy in this new era”.</p>
    <p>Amid the US’ wan­ing global in­flu­ence – a trend that Ja­panese me­dia said be­gan un­der Mr Obama who noted that “Amer­ica is not the world’s po­lice­man” – Ja­pan has sought to build closer ties with Europe, Aus­tralia and Asian na­tions.</p>
    <p>There are calls for Ja­pan to be the “sixth eye” in the Five Eyes in­tel­li­gence al­liance that com­prises Aus­tralia, Bri­tain, Canada, New Zealand and the US.</p>
    <p>This week, as the US and Ja­pan suc­cess­fully test-fired a jointly de­vel­oped in­ter­con­ti­nen­tal bal­lis­tic mis­sile, Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga wel­comed his Aus­tralian coun­ter­part Scott Mor­ri­son in Tokyo.</p>
    <p>The two lead­ers agreed on a bi­lat­eral de­fence pact to al­low their troops to work more closely, in what is the first such ar­range­ment for Ja­pan since the 1960 sta­tus of forces deal with the US.</p>
    <p>Dr Tosh Mi­no­hara, who chairs the Re­search In­sti­tute for Indo-Pa­cific Af­fairs, says it is a “cat-and­mouse game” with a risk of China, North Korea and Rus­sia align­ing to­gether even more closely.</p>
    <p>This re­in­forces the im­por­tance of Ja­pan build­ing part­ner­ships and beef­ing up its own de­fence ca­pa­bil­i­ties, he adds. “Un­like the US, Ja­pan has no op­tion of falling back (given its ge­o­graph­i­cal lo­ca­tion),” he says. “While Bi­den’s elec­tion means it is gen­er­ally back to busi­ness as usual, it does not mean that Ja­pan can just sit back and not be proac­tive in en­gag­ing the US.”</p>
