    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s chal­leng­ing fis­cal po­si­tion is the re­sult of a global pan­demic that no one could have pre­dicted, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>But what is within the na­tion’s con­trol is how to use its fis­cal re­sources well to re­spond to the Covid-19 cri­sis and pre­pare for the fu­ture, he told Par­lia­ment in a min­is­te­rial state­ment.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, Sin­ga­pore is ded­i­cat­ing nearly $100 bil­lion to sup­port its peo­ple and busi­nesses, said Mr Heng, who is also the Fi­nance Min­is­ter. But the coun­try must be care­ful not to spend this in a way that “squan­ders what gen­er­a­tions be­fore us have painstak­ingly built up”, he added.</p>
    <p>“Our guid­ing prin­ci­ple is pru­dence, not aus­ter­ity. We will con­tinue to in­vest de­ci­sively in our na­tional pri­or­i­ties, with a deep com­mit­ment to leave be­hind a bet­ter fu­ture for our chil­dren.”</p>
    <p>Mr Heng told Par­lia­ment that Sin­ga­pore’s rev­enue po­si­tion will con­tinue to be weak for a num­ber of years, as the ef­fects of Covid-19 on the global econ­omy linger and the do­mes­tic econ­omy slows.</p>
    <p>At the same time, ex­pen­di­ture will rise as the Gov­ern­ment con­tin­ues to pro­vide sup­port for Sin­ga­pore­ans and busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng added: “In short, the Gov­ern­ment is bear­ing a sub­stan­tial part of the econ­omy-wide ad­just­ment dur­ing this cri­sis, through re­duced rev­enues and sub­stan­tial trans­fers to house­holds and busi­nesses.”</p>
    <p>The re­vised op­er­at­ing rev­enue is pro­jected to be $63.7 bil­lion, 7.4 per cent lower than the es­ti­mates pre­sented in the For­ti­tude Bud­get in May. The de­crease is mainly due to more sub­dued eco­nomic growth due to Covid-19 and lower eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue col­lec­tion is ex­pected to fall across all cat­e­gories. Com­pared with es­ti­mates made at the start of the year, goods and ser­vices tax col­lec­tions are ex­pected to fall by 14 per cent.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment’s pro­jected to­tal ex­pen­di­ture is $102.1 bil­lion, 7.6 per cent lower com­pared with the For­ti­tude Bud­get es­ti­mates.</p>
    <p>Spe­cial trans­fers are up 6.3 per cent com­pared with the May es­ti­mate and now pro­jected to be $54.5 bil­lion. The $3.2 bil­lion in­crease is mainly due to the ex­ten­sion of Jobs Sup­port Scheme to cover wages up to next March.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Net In­vest­ment Re­turns Con­tri­bu­tion, which is the re­turn on in­vest­ments of Sin­ga­pore’s re­serves, has not changed and is es­ti­mated to be $18.6 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the Gov­ern­ment projects a deficit of $74.2 bil­lion for its 2020 fi­nan­cial year, $0.1 bil­lion less than the For­ti­tude Bud­get pro­jec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said there is no ad­di­tional draw on the re­serves for the lat­est sup­port mea­sures an­nounced yes­ter­day, which in­clude a one-off sup­port mea­sure for par­ents of new­born ba­bies.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter said there was much work to be done “to trans­form our econ­omy, and to build a fair and in­clu­sive so­ci­ety, a sus­tain­able and live­able city, and a safe and se­cure Sin­ga­pore”, and that “dif­fi­cult choices” have to be made to fund them sus­tain­ably through higher taxes and more ef­fec­tive spend­ing.</p>
    <p>“We will also main­tain a dis­ci­plined and ju­di­cious use of bor­row­ing, re­serv­ing its use for long-term in­fras­truc­ture whose ben­e­fits are spread across many gen­er­a­tions,” he said.</p>
    <p>The past re­serves have been crit­i­cal in the na­tion’s fight against Covid-19, Mr Heng noted.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ments around the world have com­mit­ted tril­lions of dol­lars to their pan­demic re­sponse, and their record-high debt lev­els will take gen­er­a­tions to pay off.</p>
    <p>“We have avoided this out­come, be­cause suc­ces­sive gen­er­a­tions have built up strong re­serves ahead of this cri­sis,” said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>“We must have the dis­ci­pline to start earn­ing, sav­ing and in­vest­ing for the fu­ture again. Covid-19 is not our first cri­sis and cer­tainly will not be the last.”</p>
