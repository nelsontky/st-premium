    <p>Spec­u­la­tion is rife that the col­lec­tive sale mar­ket could kick off again next year due to the con­tin­ued drop in un­sold in­ven­tory and a con­ser­va­tive slate of sites on the Gov­ern­ment Land Sales (GLS) pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­sold units has dropped for six straight quar­ters, with new pri­vate home sales out­per­form­ing ex­pec­ta­tions de­spite the re­ces­sion, global real es­tate ser­vices firm JLL said.</p>
    <p>There were 26,578 units on the mar­ket as of the third quar­ter of this year, well down from the peak of 37,799 in the first quar­ter of last year. “The con­tin­ued drop might lead to some re­vival in the col­lec­tive sale mar­ket next year. It is not nec­es­sary for un­sold in­ven­tory to reach a very low level be­fore de­mand for res­i­den­tial sites picks up,” JLL said in its Sin­ga­pore res­i­den­tial mar­ket out­look 2021 re­port.</p>
    <p>Case in point, the num­ber of un­sold pri­vate res­i­den­tial units was 23,282 when the col­lec­tive sale of Shunfu Ville oc­curred in the sec­ond quar­ter of 2016, which set the stage for the col­lec­tive sale fever in 2017 and early 2018, it noted.</p>
    <p>An­other fac­tor is the mod­er­ate sup­ply un­der the GLS pro­gramme, which could lead to a short­age of sites in cer­tain mar­ket seg­ments.</p>
    <p>“The con­firmed list sup­ply of 1,930 pri­vate res­i­den­tial units for 2020 is a low level com­pared with the an­nual sup­ply of pri­vate homes rang­ing from 2,875 units to 4,355 units in the con­firmed lists of the pre­ced­ing five years,” JLL said.</p>
    <p>The grow­ing hunger for land is ev­i­dent in the ten­der for the Tanah Merah Kechil Link par­cel, which has at­tracted 15 bid­ders.</p>
    <p>The site yielded a top bid of $930 per sq ft per plot ra­tio (psf ppr) while an ex­ec­u­tive con­do­minium plot in Yishun Av­enue 9 at­tracted $576 psf ppr, both “higher than ex­pected”, JLL noted.</p>
    <p>These prices are un­der­pinned by ex­pec­ta­tions that home buy­ing could im­prove fur­ther next year. Although some an­a­lysts see devel­op­ers cap­i­tal­is­ing on the sales mo­men­tum, Ms Chris­tine Sun, OrangeTee & Tie’s head of re­search and con­sul­tancy, ex­pects fewer launches next year than this year and last, as “most mega projects would al­ready have been launched”.</p>
    <p>Devel­op­ers launched 7,736 units, or 20 new projects, for sale in the first nine months of the year.</p>
    <p>“The num­ber of projects launched from the 2017 to 2018 spate of ag­gres­sive land deals has neared its peak and is ex­pected to ta­per from next year,” she said.</p>
    <p>Chal­lenges re­main even as pri­vate home prices could rise by 2 per cent to 5 per cent next year, said an­a­lysts. They cited the new wave of Covid-19 in­fec­tions in Europe, among other rea­sons.</p>
