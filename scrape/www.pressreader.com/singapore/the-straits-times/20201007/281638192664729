    <p>There was no proper jus­ti­fi­ca­tion for Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong to sue blog­ger and fi­nan­cial ad­viser Leong Sze Hian for defama­tion, con­tended Mr Leong’s lawyer Lim Tean yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This was be­cause the Gov­ern­ment had al­ready taken suf­fi­cient ac­tion to de­bunk the false al­le­ga­tions against it, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim, an op­po­si­tion politi­cian who heads the Peo­ples Voice party, pointed the High Court to state­ments put out by the Sin­ga­pore High Com­mis­sion in Malaysia, the Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore and the In­fo­comm and Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Author­ity on the case, as well as re­marks made in Novem­ber 2018 by Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam.</p>
    <p>All these were widely car­ried in the main­stream me­dia, he said.</p>
    <p>The law­suit against his client, added Mr Lim, was “re­ally an at­tempt to pro­tect the in­tegrity of the Gov­ern­ment and rep­u­ta­tion of the Gov­ern­ment, not a gen­uine li­bel ac­tion for the plain­tiff to re­cover his rep­u­ta­tion”.</p>
    <p>PM Lee had sued Mr Leong over a post the blog­ger shared on his Face­book page on Nov 7, 2018, which con­tained a link to an ar­ti­cle by Malaysian news site The Cov­er­age.</p>
    <p>The ar­ti­cle con­tained al­le­ga­tions that for­mer Malaysian prime min­is­ter Na­jib Razak had signed “se­cret deals” with PM Lee in ex­change for Sin­ga­pore banks’ help in laun­der­ing money from scan­dal-rid­den Malaysian state fund 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had, or 1MDB.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim be­gan the four-day hear­ing, presided over by Justice Aedit Ab­dul­lah, by go­ing through var­i­ous me­dia re­ports of state­ments made by the au­thor­i­ties on the case. These me­dia out­lets were all “prom­i­nent and in­flu­en­tial” in Sin­ga­pore, and the state­ments would have been read by many Sin­ga­pore­ans, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim said the gov­ern­ment state­ments had been ef­fec­tive in de­bunk­ing the false al­le­ga­tions, and PM Lee might have been en­ti­tled to sue, but not jus­ti­fied in do­ing so.</p>
    <p>PM Lee replied: “We went to the best of our abil­ity to re­but as strongly as we could.”</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment state­ments, he said, “had an im­pact but they didn’t an­swer one ques­tion: What is Lee Hsien Loong do­ing to clear his name?”</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment ac­tions do not ob­vi­ate the need for him to take pri­vate civil ac­tion, he added.</p>
    <p>PM Lee said he had to act, adding: “In pre­vi­ous cases, where there is jus­ti­fi­ca­tion, I have sued.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lim also asked PM Lee if he was “rid­ing two horses” by tak­ing ac­tion as head of gov­ern­ment and as a pri­vate cit­i­zen.</p>
    <p>“I don’t ac­cept that,” PM Lee replied. “As PM, I am re­spon­si­ble for the op­er­a­tion of gov­ern­ment and to make sure it pro­tects its rep­u­ta­tion. But at the same time, as a pri­vate cit­i­zen, I have to pro­tect my rep­u­ta­tion and in­tegrity and I have a re­spon­si­bil­ity to do so.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lim then pointed out that PM Lee sued Mr Leong on Nov 12, sev­eral days af­ter the au­thor­i­ties is­sued their state­ments.</p>
    <p>PM Lee said his lawyer’s let­ter to Mr Leong was is­sued af­ter the var­i­ous agen­cies put up state­ments, but his in­struc­tions to his lawyer Davin­der Singh were made be­fore that.</p>
    <p>“Whether there were state­ments by the Gov­ern­ment were ir­rel­e­vant to my de­ci­sion to sue the de­fen­dant. Does he take down, apol­o­gise and com­mit not to re­peat? He had not at the time I de­cided to sue,” he added.</p>
