    <p>As you walk through the doors of Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal (NTFGH) next month, a ro­bot will scan your SafeEn­try check-in and record your tem­per­a­ture.</p>
    <p>The se­cu­rity and concierge ro­bot will also de­tect vis­i­tors and pa­tients who are not wear­ing masks or fol­low­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules, and deny these non-com­pli­ant vis­i­tors en­try.</p>
    <p>The ro­bot will be de­ployed at NTFGH from next month, and it will also be in ac­tion at Alexan­dra Hos­pi­tal from Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Around the same time, the Na­tional University Hos­pi­tal will have a rov­ing se­cu­rity ro­bot that can iden­tify sus­pi­cious ac­tiv­i­ties such as crowd­ing and peo­ple lurk­ing in re­stricted ar­eas.</p>
    <p>The three hos­pi­tals are part of the public healthcare clus­ter un­der the Na­tional University Health Sys­tem (NUHS).</p>
    <p>NUHS said ro­bots, drones and touch-free tech­nolo­gies will be­come the new nor­mal. The shift to tech­nol­ogy-based solutions comes as the hos­pi­tals seek to min­imise labour-in­ten­sive op­er­a­tions and move to a more ef­fi­cient, safer and pro­duc­tive way to man­age its fa­cil­i­ties. This will not only save time but also slice costs by at least 50 per cent in each hos­pi­tal, NUHS said.</p>
    <p>“We are not us­ing tech­nol­ogy to replace our col­leagues at the NUHS Group Fa­cil­ity Man­age­ment Team,” said Mr Ng Kian Swan, the chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer of NUHS.</p>
    <p>“In­stead, the tech­nolo­gies will be used to sup­port them in their work and give them the op­por­tu­nity to reskill and up­skill.”</p>
    <p>Some staff are learn­ing on the job as they work with In­ter­net of Things sen­sors, for in­stance, and oth­ers have been sent for cour­ses to learn how to fly drones, added Mr Ng.</p>
    <p>RO­BOTS NOT RE­PLAC­ING WORK­ERS</p>
    <p>We are not us­ing tech­nol­ogy to replace our col­leagues at the NUHS Group Fa­cil­ity Man­age­ment Team. In­stead, the tech­nolo­gies will be used to sup­port them in their work and give them the op­por­tu­nity to reskill and up­skill.</p>
    <p>MR NG KIAN SWAN, chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer of NUHS.</p>
    <p>With the bots on the front line pa­trolling and ob­serv­ing, se­cu­rity of­fi­cers can fo­cus on value-adding du­ties such as us­ing video an­a­lyt­ics to re­view footage that the ro­bots send in. Drones are al­ready be­ing used to scan the build­ings’ ex­te­rior, to look out for haz­ards and ar­eas that need main­te­nance work.</p>
    <p>NUHS is the first or­gan­i­sa­tion in the lo­cal healthcare scene to use</p>
    <p>drones to in­spect hos­pi­tals. Armed with high-res­o­lu­tion cam­eras, the drones can cap­ture live footage of hard-to-reach ar­eas such as roof gut­ters, and de­tect wa­ter pond­ing on rooftops, a po­ten­tial breed­ing ground for Aedes mos­qui­toes.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, gon­do­las – manned and moved by work­ers – were used to in­spect build­ing fa­cades. Work­ers were also ex­posed to dan­ger when</p>
    <p>scal­ing lad­ders and by walk­ing on ledges and weak roofs.</p>
    <p>To pre­vent trans­mis­sion of bac­te­ria and viruses, the three hos­pi­tals will in­stall touch-free but­tons in lifts that pa­tients and vis­i­tors fre­quently use, by next year. To pi­lot this, some lifts at NTFGH’s Tower B have been in­stalled with touch-free but­tons.</p>
