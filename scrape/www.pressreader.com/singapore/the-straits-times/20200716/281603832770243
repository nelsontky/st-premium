    <p>In­ter­na­tional stu­dents breathed a sigh of re­lief on Tues­day as the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion re­versed a rule that would have de­nied them visas to re­main in the United States or en­ter the coun­try, if their col­leges moved classes fully on­line due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The im­mi­gra­tion pol­icy re­ver­sal came amid eight fed­eral law­suits chal­leng­ing the snap de­ci­sion, which had first been de­clared on July 6, and fierce op­po­si­tion from dozens of uni­ver­si­ties, tech gi­ants and Repub­li­can mem­bers of Congress.</p>
    <p>The re­ver­sal was an­nounced at a hear­ing in a fed­eral court in Bos­ton for a law­suit brought by Har­vard Univer­sity and the Mas­sachusetts In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy (MIT).</p>
    <p>This means the US Im­mi­gra­tion and Cus­toms En­force­ment (ICE) agency will re­turn to its March di­rec­tive that tem­po­rar­ily ex­empted for­eign stu­dents from hav­ing to take most of their classes in per­son, as col­leges moved lessons on­line amid the surge in Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the re­ver­sal, in­ter­na­tional stu­dents cur­rently in the US, whose en­tire course load had shifted on­line, would have had to leave or be de­ported, while those out­side the US might have been de­nied stu­dent visas for the new school year.</p>
    <p>“The ICE di­rec­tive sought to force each of us to choose be­tween the health of our com­mu­ni­ties and the ed­u­ca­tion of our in­ter­na­tional stu­dents – a false and dan­ger­ous choice which we re­jected,” said</p>
    <p>UNSTABLE SIT­U­A­TION</p>
    <p>Since things are quite volatile in the US at this point, es­pe­cially with the up­com­ing pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in Novem­ber, ’’ any­thing can hap­pen. MS BENITA LIM, who is in Los An­ge­les. She had de­cided not to re­turn to Sin­ga­pore as that would have been dis­rup­tive to her stud­ies at Fuller The­o­log­i­cal Sem­i­nary.</p>
    <p>Har­vard Univer­sity pres­i­dent Lawrence Ba­cow in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Har­vard, MIT and other uni­ver­si­ties which had an­nounced plans for re­mote teach­ing ar­gued that the ICE di­rec­tive was reck­less and cruel, as well as a ploy to force them to open classes. The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has been push­ing for schools to re­open in au­tumn.</p>
    <p>There are more than one mil­lion in­ter­na­tional stu­dents in the US con­tribut­ing over US$41 bil­lion (S$57 bil­lion) to the econ­omy yearly and the loss of the mil­lions of dol­lars in tu­ition fees they pay would have dealt a heavy blow to higher ed­u­ca­tion in­sti­tutes, they ar­gued.</p>
    <p>With the change, Sin­ga­porean stu­dents re­luc­tant to re­turn to the US can now study for their au­tumn se­mes­ter from Sin­ga­pore if they wish. Those in the US will not have to risk their health to show up for classes in per­son, which had con­cerned some, as the US is re­port­ing al­most 60,000 new cases a day.</p>
    <p>Sales di­rec­tor Eu­gene Tan, 48, whose son re­turned to Sin­ga­pore in April mid­way through his first-year stud­ies in the US, said he has strongly ad­vised the 22-year-old against go­ing back to the US and to ei­ther switch to a univer­sity in Sin­ga­pore or take a gap year. “Not only is the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion get­ting worse there, but you also have the gov­ern­ment do­ing a flip-flop on their pol­icy with re­gard to in­ter­na­tional stu­dents.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion an­nounced that the six au­ton­o­mous uni­ver­si­ties here have stepped up to of­fer around 2,000 more places this year be­cause of the dis­rup­tions caused by the pan­demic. Some of the ad­di­tional of­fers went to Sin­ga­pore­ans whose over­seas study plans had been dis­rupted.</p>
    <p>Mr Dar­ius Cheong, 21, had orig­i­nally planned to head to the Univer­sity of Vir­ginia in the US to study busi­ness man­age­ment, but will in­stead be pur­su­ing a busi­ness de­gree at the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity from next month.</p>
    <p>He is wor­ried politi­cians like US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump may whip up sen­ti­ments against for­eign­ers, in­clud­ing in­ter­na­tional stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Ms Kather­ine Su­mantri, 25, who re­turned to Sin­ga­pore in March, is plan­ning a trip back to the US on hear­ing the news. “That just caused me a week of high anx­i­ety,” said Ms Su­mantri, who is study­ing for a mas­ter’s de­gree in speech-lan­guage pathol­ogy at Teach­ers Col­lege, Columbia Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Ms Benita Lim is still in Los An­ge­les. The 33-year-old, who will soon be­gin the sec­ond year of her PhD pro­gramme in the­ol­ogy and cul­ture at Fuller The­o­log­i­cal Sem­i­nary, said hav­ing to re­turn to Sin­ga­pore would have been dis­rup­tive. But she is aware the sit­u­a­tion can change again.</p>
    <p>The Depart­ment of Home­land Se­cu­rity is still mulling over whether to treat stu­dents al­ready in the US dif­fer­ently than those seek­ing to en­ter the coun­try for the first time, re­ported Reuters.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Lim: “Since things are quite volatile in the US at this point, es­pe­cially with the up­com­ing pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in Novem­ber, any­thing can hap­pen.”</p>
