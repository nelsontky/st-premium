    <p>GENEVA • The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion ( WHO) re­ported a record one-day in­crease in global coro­n­avirus cases on Sun­day, with the to­tal ris­ing by 307,930 in 24 hours.</p>
    <p>The big­gest increases were from In­dia, the United States and Brazil, ac­cord­ing to the agency’s web­site. Deaths rose by 5,537 to a to­tal of 917,417.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a col­lec­tive fail­ure by po­lit­i­cal lead­ers to heed warn­ings and pre­pare for an in­fec­tious dis­ease pan­demic has trans­formed “a world at risk” to a “world in dis­or­der”, ac­cord­ing to a re­port on in­ter­na­tional epi­demic pre­pared­ness.</p>
    <p>“Fi­nan­cial and po­lit­i­cal in­vest­ments in pre­pared­ness have been in­suf­fi­cient, and we are all pay­ing the price,” said the re­port by The Global Pre­pared­ness Monitoring Board (GPMB).</p>
    <p>“It is not as if the world has lacked the op­por­tu­nity to take these steps,” it added. “There have been nu­mer­ous calls for ac­tion... over the last decade, yet none has gen­er­ated the changes needed.”</p>
    <p>The GPMB, co-con­vened by the World Bank and WHO, is chaired by for­mer WHO di­rec­tor-gen­eral Gro Har­lem Brundt­land.</p>
    <p>Last year, the board’s re­port that was re­leased a few months be­fore the coro­n­avirus emerged in China said there was a real threat of “a rapidly spread­ing pan­demic due to a lethal res­pi­ra­tory pathogen” and warned that such an event could kill mil­lions and wreak havoc on the global econ­omy.</p>
    <p>This year’s re­port – en­ti­tled A World In Dis­or­der – said global lead­ers had never be­fore “been so clearly fore­warned of the dan­gers of a dev­as­tat­ing pan­demic”, and yet they had failed to take ad­e­quate ac­tion.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has ex­posed “a col­lec­tive fail­ure to take pan­demic preven­tion, pre­pared­ness and re­sponse se­ri­ously and pri­ori­tise it ac­cord­ingly”, it said.</p>
    <p>“Pathogens thrive in dis­rup­tion and dis­or­der. Covid-19 has proven the point.”</p>
    <p>The re­port noted that de­spite call­ing a year ago for heads of gov­ern­ment to com­mit and in­vest in pan­demic pre­pared­ness, for health sys­tems to be strength­ened and for fi­nan­cial risk plan­ning to take se­ri­ously the threat of a dev­as­tat­ing pan­demic, lit­tle progress had been made on any of these.</p>
    <p>A lack of lead­er­ship, it said, is ex­ac­er­bat­ing the current pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Fail­ure to learn the lessons of Covid-19 or to act on them with the nec­es­sary re­sources and com­mit­ment will mean that the next pan­demic, which is sure to come, will be even more dam­ag­ing,” it said.</p>
    <p>Signs of the con­tin­ued ex­pert warn­ings be­ing ig­nored could be seen around the world in re­cent days.</p>
    <p>In the US pres­i­den­tial campaign, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump held a rally in Ne­vada at an in­door venue on Sun­day de­spite pub­lic health pro­fes­sion­als’ warn­ings against such gath­er­ings. Most peo­ple in the crowd were seated close to­gether and many did not wear masks.</p>
    <p>In France, In­te­rior Min­is­ter Ger­ald Dar­manin crit­i­cised fans of foot­ball club Olympique Mar­seille for cel­e­brat­ing en masse on the streets of the city yes­ter­day, after Mar­seille beat Paris Saint Ger­main, given the risks from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mar­seille is among the main­land French cities hard­est hit by the virus’ resur­gence.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, ex­perts have de­scribed as dan­ger­ous and pre­ma­ture the Philip­pines’ de­ci­sion to cut the so­cial dis­tanc­ing min­i­mum to 30cm on pub­lic trans­port, as the coun­try saw an­other daily record in new deaths.</p>
    <p>This is a third of the 1m min­i­mum dis­tance re­quire­ment ad­vised by ex­perts.</p>
    <p>DIS­RUP­TION AND DIS­OR­DER</p>
    <p>Pathogens thrive in dis­rup­tion and dis­or­der. Covid-19 has proven the point.</p>
