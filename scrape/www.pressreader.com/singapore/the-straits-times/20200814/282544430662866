    <p>Kueh led the way at the Sin­ga­pore Book Awards yesterday, as Christo­pher Tan’s her­itage food book The Way Of Kueh won Book of the Year at the an­nual in­dus­try awards by the Sin­ga­pore Book Pub­lish­ers As­so­ci­a­tion (SBPA).</p>
    <p>The sixth edi­tion of the Sin­ga­pore Book Awards, which recog­nise the best in lo­cal book pub­lish­ing, was live-streamed on the SBPA’s Face­book page.</p>
    <p>Tan, 47, wrote the book to make his fel­low Sin­ga­pore­ans more aware of the food of their her­itage. It took him al­most five years to re­search its recipes.</p>
    <p>“I want to thank all the kuehmak­ers es­pe­cially,” he said. “They are the true na­tional trea­sures of our coun­try.”</p>
    <p>The book, which also won Best Il­lus­trated Non-Fic­tion Ti­tle, spent four weeks on The Straits Times best­seller list last year.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, the Book of the Year judg­ing panel hailed The Way Of Kueh as the first book to cover the his­tory and cul­ture of kueh in all its splen­dour and range: “Its im­pact, rel­e­vance and im­por­tance is in its con­tri­bu­tion to the her­itage and knowl­edge it brings to the com­mu­nity as well as to the culi­nary world.”</p>
    <p>The panel com­prises for­mer Books Ki­noku­niya Asia-Pa­cific se­nior store and mer­chan­dis­ing direc­tor Kenny Chan, Na­tional Li­brary Board (NLB) se­nior head of se­lec­tion Kathryn Lane and for­mer SBPA pres­i­dent Triena Ong.</p>
    <p>In a rare move, they also gave an hon­orary men­tion to Loss Ad­just­ment by Linda Collins, a lit­er­ary mem­oir about how the au­thor’s teenage daugh­ter took her own life. They praised the book for “bravely break­ing the si­lence on sui­cide”.</p>
    <p>There is tra­di­tion­ally no short­list for the Book of the Year cat­e­gory, which is judged by a sep­a­rate panel after other prizes are de­cided. The win­ning ti­tles of the other cat­e­gories, plus in­de­pen­dent sub­mis­sions, are con­sid­ered.</p>
    <p>Ten ti­tles, cho­sen from 46 fi­nal­ists, scored wins at the cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>Home­less – a mem­oir by Liyana Dhami­rah about how, aged 22, she wound up preg­nant and liv­ing in a tent on Sem­bawang Beach – won Best Non-Fic­tion Ti­tle.</p>
    <p>Best Lit­er­ary Work went to Fall Baby by In­done­sian writer Laksmi Pa­munt­jak, a novel about a con­tro­ver­sial artist who dis­cov­ers her birth fa­ther died a po­lit­i­cal pris­oner. It was pub­lished lo­cally by Pen­guin Ran­dom House South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Three cat­e­gories for Best E-book,</p>
    <p>Best Au­dio­book and Best Dig­i­tal Mar­ket­ing Cam­paign were in­tro­duced this year.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion Sim Ann, the event’s guest of hon­our, said she was en­cour­aged to see the new cat­e­gories.</p>
    <p>In the first half of this year alone, she said, Sin­ga­pore­ans bor­rowed more than three mil­lion e-books from li­braries. “While some of these fig­ures could be at­trib­uted to the cir­cuit breaker, which gave many the op­por­tu­nity to re­dis­cover the joy of read­ing, there has un­doubt­edly been an un­der­ly­ing shift in con­sumer de­mand.”</p>
    <p>Sto­ry­tel Sin­ga­pore, the Swedish au­dio­book gi­ant’s en­try into the lo­cal mar­ket, won Best Dig­i­tal Mar­ket­ing Cam­paign. Best E-Book went to Shing Lee Pub­lish­ers’ think! Ad­di­tional Math­e­mat­ics e-text­books.</p>
    <p>Best Au­dio­book was awarded to Penghuni Rumah Tua by Malay­lan­guage pub­lisher Pus­taka Na­sional, which also re­ceived a spe­cial men­tion for its use of tech­nol­ogy to cre­ate bilin­gual e-re­sources.</p>
    <p>As with last year, Epi­gram Books was the big win­ner, with four awards in­clud­ing The Way Of Kueh’s two wins, Home­less and Best Book Cover De­sign for Bar­rie Sher­wood’s short story col­lec­tion, The An­gel Tiger And Other Sto­ries.</p>
    <p>To qual­ify for the awards, books must be pub­lished in one of Sin­ga­pore’s four of­fi­cial lan­guages be­tween Jan 1 and Dec 31 the pre­vi­ous year.</p>
    <p>They must have a Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Stan­dard Book Num­ber, a unique num­ber that iden­ti­fies each edi­tion of a book, with hard copies legally de­posited with the NLB. Books sold in print must be sold in re­tail stores lo­cally and/or over­seas.</p>
    <p>Win­ners, who were cho­sen by a panel of judges com­pris­ing writ­ers, aca­demics and other in­dus­try in­sid­ers, re­ceived a plaque and a cer­tifi­cate of recog­ni­tion.</p>
