    <p>Ex­ten­sions were granted to the national ser­vice (NS) de­fer­ments of Olympic-bound swim­mers Joseph School­ing and Quah Zheng Wen, the Min­istry of Defence (Min­def) an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It said in a state­ment that both ath­letes’ ap­pli­ca­tions for ex­ten­sions for the Tokyo Games – post­poned by a year due to the coro­n­avirus cri­sis – were ap­proved by the Armed Forces Coun­cil, and sup­ported by the Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth (MCCY).</p>
    <p>Min­def also ex­tended its best wishes to the pair “as they pur­sue national pride for Sin­ga­pore in the Olympic Games in 2021”.</p>
    <p>Reign­ing 100m but­ter­fly cham­pion School­ing, 25, and Quah, 23, were both granted long-term de­fer­ment from NS to com­pete at this year’s Sum­mer Games, orig­i­nally sched­uled for July 24-Aug 9.</p>
    <p>Should next year’s July 23-Aug 8 Games be can­celled, both swim­mers will be sched­uled for en­list­ment, said Min­def.</p>
    <p>The min­istry added: “They have also com­mit­ted to be fully fo­cused in their prepa­ra­tions for the Olympic Games, in or­der to reach their peak form and will not un­der­take any ad­di­tional ac­tiv­i­ties such as com­mer­cial spon­sor­ships.”</p>
    <p>Both ath­letes’ ex­ist­ing com­mer­cial spon­sor­ships are not af­fected by the ex­ten­sion, said Min­def.</p>
    <p>School­ing, who was first granted de­fer­ment in Oc­to­ber 2013 for the 2016 Olympics which was later ex­tended, said he was thank­ful to Min­def and MCCY for their sup­port. Headded: “This will al­low me to con­tinue un­hin­dered on my Olympic jour­ney. Train­ing has al­ways been and re­mains my first pri­or­ity.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter strug­gling with his form and fit­ness in 2019, School­ing ad­mit­ted in a Zoom di­a­logue ses­sion last month that he did not think he was ready to head into Tokyo 2020, and that the ex­tra year has given him a “big boost”.</p>
    <p>His time of 52.93 sec­onds at the World Cham­pi­onships in Gwangju in July last year meant he failed to even make the semi-fi­nals. Caeleb Dres­sel of the United States won gold in 49.66sec in the fi­nal.</p>
    <p>School­ing had set an Olympic record of 50.39sec en route to win­ning gold at the 2016 Rio Games.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Swim­ming As­so­ci­a­tion tech­ni­cal di­rec­tor Sonya Porter wel­comed the news, say­ing it “takes away any am­bi­gu­ity” and al­lows the ath­letes to fo­cus on their prepa­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>She said both School­ing and Quah had “kept on push­ing phys­i­cally and men­tally” through­out the Covid-19 pan­demic and the dif­fi­cul­ties that arose with it.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, Zheng Wen and his younger sis­ter Jing Wen, 19, re­turned to the United States to con­tinue their univer­sity stud­ies. School­ing will re­main here un­til given the all clear to head back to US and his home base in Vir­ginia to train un­der his coach Ser­gio Lopez.</p>
    <p>Porter added: “The plan con­tin­ues for both with train­ing pro­gres­sions and hope­fully com­pet­i­tive op­por­tu­ni­ties in the near fu­ture with fo­cus on per­for­mance out­comes for the (Olympics).</p>
    <p>“The de­fer­ment ex­ten­sion this week gave clear ex­pec­ta­tions and re­in­forced their fo­cus to stay on track to ful­fill­ing the jour­ney rep­re­sent­ing Sin­ga­pore on the big­gest sport­ing stage.”</p>
    <p>MCCY Min­is­ter Ed­win Tong said in a Face­book post yes­ter­day he was “very happy” that the ex­ten­sions were ap­proved.</p>
    <p>“The Gov­ern­ment is fully sup­port­ing their train­ing and prepa­ra­tion in their bid for Olympic suc­cess,” he said. “I wish them the very best in their cam­paigns, and hope that they will con­tinue to in­spire national pride among Sin­ga­pore­ans!”</p>
    <p>FULL STEAM AHEAD</p>
    <p>This will al­low me to con­tinue un­hin­dered on my Olympic jour­ney. Train­ing has al­ways been ’’ and re­mains my first pri­or­ity. JOSEPH SCHOOL­ING, Olympic cham­pion, on the ex­ten­sion granted by Min­def.</p>
    <p>NO DIS­TRAC­TIONS</p>
    <p>They have also com­mit­ted to be fully fo­cused in their prepa­ra­tions for the Olympic Games, in or­der to reach their peak form and will not un­der­take any ad­di­tional ac­tiv­i­ties such as com­mer­cial spon­sor­ships.</p>
