    <p>News that Ms Si­neenat Wong­va­ji­ra­pakdi is back in favour with Thai­land’s King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn took cit­i­zens by sur­prise last Wed­nes­day, but the de­vel­op­ment once again shone the spot­light on the King’s per­sonal life.</p>
    <p>No one ex­pected that Ms Si­neenat would be back in the royal fold. Then again, no one could have pre­dicted her swift fall from grace 10 months ago ei­ther, less than three months af­ter be­ing made royal noble con­sort.</p>
    <p>The lat­est palace in­trigue comes amid wide­spread protests across Thai­land by pro-democ­racy groups call­ing for more trans­parency and re­forms in the royal in­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>“(Si­neenat’s re­in­state­ment) will add fire to the demon­stra­tions and calls for re­forms,” Pro­fes­sor James Chin, di­rec­tor of the Asia In­sti­tute at the Univer­sity of Tas­ma­nia, told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>The Royal Gazette i n its an­nounce­ment dated Aug 29 de­clared that Ms Si­neenat, 35, had all her ti­tles re­stored as she “is un­tainted”.</p>
    <p>The phrase be­came a top trend­ing Twit­ter hash­tag in Thai­land on Thurs­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>High school stu­dent group Bad Stu­dent, which or­gan­ised a protest at the Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry yes­ter­day, de­clared on Fri­day that any stu­dent who does a three-fin­ger salute “is un­tainted”.</p>
    <p>The three-fin­ger salute has been used by anti-govern­ment pro­test­ers as a sym­bol against dic­ta­tor­ship.</p>
    <p>The for­mer royal body­guard was stripped of her ti­tles for “mis­be­haviour and dis­loy­alty against the monarch” last Oc­to­ber. She was also ac­cused of seek­ing to sab­o­tage Queen Suthida’s ap­point­ment in a bid to take the po­si­tion her­self.</p>
    <p>“(She) was act­ing out against the royal mar­riage and the ap­point­ment of the queen,” said the Royal Gazette in a de­tailed con­dem­na­tion of the dis­graced con­sort.</p>
    <p>Soon af­ter, the King fired nearly a dozen palace of­fi­cials – all of whom re­ceived harsh re­buke in the Royal Gazette – for rea­sons such as “ex­tremely evil mis­con­duct”.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing her royal ex­com­mu­ni­ca­tion, Ms Si­neenat dis­ap­peared</p>
    <p>ADDING FUEL TO PROTESTS</p>
    <p>(Si­neenat’s re­in­state­ment) will add fire to the demon­stra­tions and calls for re­forms.</p>
    <p>PRO­FES­SOR JAMES CHIN, di­rec­tor of the Asia In­sti­tute at the Univer­sity of Tas­ma­nia, on news that Ms Si­neenat Wong­va­ji­ra­pakdi is back in favour with King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn.</p>
    <p>from pub­lic view and all men­tion of her in the palace web­site was scrubbed.</p>
    <p>It is un­clear why Ms Si­neenat, who is be­lieved to be in Ger­many now, is be­ing re­in­stated.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment once again shone the spot­light on the 68-yearold monarch’s per­sonal life, long a sub­ject of spec­u­la­tion both in his home­land and abroad.</p>
    <p>King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn – who as­cended the throne in De­cem­ber 2016 af­ter the death of his father, King Bhu­mi­bol Adulyadej, two months ear­lier – spends most of his</p>
    <p>time abroad, es­pe­cially i n Ger­many, where he keeps a home.</p>
    <p>In March, af­ter an over­seas Thai ac­tivist posted on­line about the King con­tin­u­ing to travel in Ger­many dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the Thai-lan­guage hash­tag #why­dowe­needak­ing be­came one of the top trend­ing top­ics on Thai­land’s Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment sub­se­quently came out to warn cit­i­zens about on­line posts ques­tion­ing the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>Thai­land is strictly gov­erned by lese ma­jeste laws which pun­ish</p>
    <p>those who in­sult or de­fame the monar­chy with up to 15 years in jail.</p>
    <p>Face­book has taken down con­tent and groups that the govern­ment deemed to be in­sult­ing to the monar­chy, the lat­est be­ing a group with one mil­lion mem­bers that has crit­i­cised the King.</p>
    <p>Although Thai­land abol­ished ab­so­lute monar­chy more than 80 years ago, the king still wields sig­nif­i­cant power.</p>
    <p>Since he as­cended the throne, King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn has con­sol­i­dated his power by tak­ing per­sonal con­trol of the multi­bil­lion-dol­lar as­sets of the Crown Prop­erty Bureau and two army units.</p>
    <p>He also di­rected the govern­ment to re­write parts of the Con­sti­tu­tion that touched on the role of the king, in­clud­ing the pro­ce­dure for ap­point­ing a re­gent in the king’s ab­sence and whether royal edicts should be coun­ter­signed by a govern­ment min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Since July, pro­test­ers have gath­ered in large num­bers in the coun­try call­ing for amend­ments to the mil­i­tary-backed Con­sti­tu­tion, a fresh elec­tion and a democ­racy “with the monarch un­der the Con­sti­tu­tion”.</p>
    <p>King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn has been mar­ried four times.</p>
    <p>His first wife was his cousin whom he di­vorced in 1991.</p>
    <p>In 1994, he mar­ried ac­tress Su­jari­nee Vi­vachara­wongse.</p>
    <p>She had been his steady com­pan­ion since the late 1970s and gave birth to four sons and a daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the mar­riage did not last long, with Ms Su­jari­nee flee­ing to Bri­tain in 1996 with her chil­dren.</p>
    <p>She now lives with her sons in the United States, while her daugh­ter re­turned to live with her father in Thai­land.</p>
    <p>The King in 2001 mar­ried Ms Sri­rasmi Suwadee – who had served as his “lady-in-wait­ing” in the 1990s – and they have a son to­gether. The mar­riage ended abruptly and ac­ri­mo­niously in 2014 when she was purged and stripped of all her ti­tles while mem­bers of her fam­ily were jailed for in­sult­ing the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>He mar­ried Queen Suthida Va­ji­ra­longkorn Na Ayud­hya in May last year and raised eyebrows two months later when he anointed Ms Si­neenat as “Chao Khun Phra” or noble con­sort, a ti­tle that was last used al­most a cen­tury ago.</p>
    <p>Born in the north­ern Thai prov­ince of Nan, Ms Si­neenat, nick­named Koi, is a trained pi­lot and a for­mer nurse.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the unexpected el­e­va­tion of her sta­tus came the un­prece­dented re­lease of a se­ries of can­did pic­tures fea­tur­ing the new con­sort – from her in a crop top at the con­trols of a fighter jet, to her and the King dressed in com­bat fa­tigues, with royal poo­dle in arm – which drew so many vis­i­tors to the palace web­site that it crashed.</p>
    <p>Those pho­tos, along with her re­pute, were, how­ever, ef­faced less than three months later.</p>
