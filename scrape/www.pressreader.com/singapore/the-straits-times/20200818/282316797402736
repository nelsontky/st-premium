    <p>LON­DON • Ron­nie O’Sul­li­van is as quick with his quips as he is when pot­ting balls on the snooker ta­ble.</p>
    <p>There were no spec­ta­tors at the Cru­cible The­atre in Sheffield for the ma­jor­ity of the World Cham­pi­onship, but it did not pre­vent the 44-year-old from liven­ing up pro­ceed­ings on and off the ta­ble.</p>
    <p>He courted con­tro­versy ear­lier in the tour­na­ment, lam­bast­ing the new gen­er­a­tion of snooker play­ers and claim­ing they were so bad he would have to “lose an arm and a leg” to fall out of the top 50.</p>
    <p>But on Sun­day, he dis­played his charm­ing side that has made him such an enig­matic char­ac­ter in the sport and ar­guably its great­estever show­man.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a dev­as­tat­ing burst to crush fel­low English­man Kyren Wilson 18-8 to wrap up his sixth world ti­tle, O’Sul­li­van likened him­self to Rod­ney from Bri­tish clas­sic sit­com Only Fools And Horses.</p>
    <p>“I’ve watched a bit of (comic char­ac­ters) Del Boy and Rod­ney (be­fore matches),” he said. “Laila (Rouass, his ac­tress fi­ancee) says I’m like Rod­ney. Ron­nie the plonker, rather than Rod­ney the plonker, maybe.”</p>
    <p>O’Sul­li­van has not changed since turn­ing pro­fes­sional 28 years ago – he re­mains a lov­able rogue and one of the game’s best play­ers.</p>
    <p>The stage looked set for an­other slice of drama when Wilson re­cov­ered from 8-2 on Satur­day to trail 10-7 overnight and then won Sun­day’s opener to close the gap to two frames.</p>
    <p>But O’Sul­li­van, jaded and out of touch pre­vi­ously, pot­ted a red by a fluke early in the sec­ond frame of the day and pro­ceeded to switch on the kind of ef­fort­less break-build­ing that is his trade­mark, reel­ing off a vic­to­ri­ous streak of eight straight frames.</p>
    <p>He en­tered the evening ses­sion 17-8 ahead, need­ing just one more frame to get his hands back on the tro­phy he first claimed in 2001 and won in 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2013.</p>
    <p>There was to be no mir­a­cle come­back for Wilson as O’Sul­li­van wrapped up the ti­tle with a ma­jes­tic break of 96 and af­ter­wards, he de­clared his sat­is­fac­tion with his “won­der­ful ca­reer”, with only one record still stand­ing.</p>
    <p>On draw­ing level with Stephen Hendry’s record of seven world ti­tles next year, “Rocket”, who sur­passed the Scot’s pre­vi­ous mark of 36 rank­ing ti­tles here, said: “I was happy to get one world ti­tle at one stage. Once I got to four, I knew I could call my­self one of the greats, be­cause that’s how many times John Hig­gins had won it.</p>
    <p>“Any­thing above that and you are in fan­tas­tic com­pany. If I was to go out there and play as if I wanted to break records, I would not play as well as I do. I never re­ally think about ti­tles. When I was a kid, I never re­ally dreamt I would be here.”</p>
    <p>The vic­tory was the big­gest win­ning mar­gin in a fi­nal in 12 years. In 2008, O’Sul­li­van beat com­pa­triot Ali Carter by an iden­ti­cal score­line. He is the old­est win­ner since Ray Rear­don, who was 45 when he won in 1978, and Wilson be­lieves there is no one like him.</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old said: “I lost to the great­est player of all time in Ron­nie O’Sul­li­van.”</p>
