    <p>Train To Bu­san: Penin­sula steam­rolled its way to a week­end box-of­fice record for a South Korean film in Sin­ga­pore, by tak­ing $962,000. The movie, about a team of sur­vivors fight­ing their way out of the zom­bie-over­run Korean penin­sula, pushes the first movie in the fran­chise, Train To Bu­san, to sec­ond place.</p>
    <p>The first week­end of box-of­fice take af­ter the re­open­ing of cin­e­mas on July 13 ap­pears to show that au­di­ences are re­turn­ing to cin­e­mas.</p>
    <p>The zom­bie movie Train To Bu­san: Penin­sula steam­rolled its way to a week­end box-of­fice record for a South Korean movie in Sin­ga­pore, tak­ing $962,000 from Thurs­day to Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The movie, about a team of sur­vivors fight­ing their way out of the zom­bie-over­run Korean penin­sula, has pushed the first movie in the fran­chise, Train To Bu­san (2016), with its first week­end earn­ings of $611,000, to sec­ond place.</p>
    <p>Pe­riod ac­tion film The Bat­tle­ship Is­land (2017) is now third at $460,000.</p>
    <p>The stel­lar per­for­mance of Penin­sula, which opened on 97 screens, comes de­spite new hy­giene mea­sures such as the limit of 50 per­sons per screen­ing and a 1m so­cial dis­tance between groups.</p>
    <p>Such mea­sures have lim­ited seat­ing to about 25 per cent of the usual ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>Cin­ema op­er­a­tors to whom The Straits Times spoke were also car­ry­ing out more in­ten­sive dis­in­fec­tion rou­tines between screen­ings, in turn lead­ing to fewer screen­ings.</p>
    <p>The resur­gence in traf­fic bodes well for Hol­ly­wood block­busters, which have been held back from re­lease un­til next month and be­yond.</p>
    <p>Cin­e­mas have been closed since March 27 in a bid to curb the spread of the coro­n­avirus, but there were signs be­fore then that film­go­ers were stay­ing away for fear of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Shaw The­atres, which has seven out­lets cur­rently in op­er­a­tion, says they “did bet­ter than an­tic­i­pated” over the open­ing week­end.</p>
    <p>Penin­sula per­formed well for them, as did the bi­o­graph­i­cal film Es­cape From Pre­to­ria.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve pa­trons will come back to the cin­ema when there is a pop­u­lar ti­tle and know­ing that the cin­ema has all the nec­es­sary safe man­age­ment mea­sures in place,” the spokesman said.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Cathay Cine­plexes, which op­er­ates in eight lo­ca­tions, said “it is still early days, but we are en­cour­aged by the re­sponse of our guests”.</p>
    <p>The strong per­for­mance of Penin­sula shows that “peo­ple are still very much look­ing for­ward to the movie ex­pe­ri­ence in the cin­e­mas, that they feel safe and are will­ing to go through the safety mea­sures for that”.</p>
