    <p>JO­HOR BARU In­dus­try lead­ers in Jo­hor have urged Jo­hore­ans to work hard in com­bat­ing the cur­rent spike in Covid-19 cases, in or­der for Sin­ga­pore to re­open its bor­der with the state.</p>
    <p>Mr Michael Tay, gov­ern­ment af­fairs co­or­di­nat­ing chair­man for the Jo­hor chap­ter of the Malaysian Chi­nese As­so­ci­a­tion, said Sin­ga­pore would not re­open the two land links with the state if Covid-19 cases in Jo­hor re­mained high.</p>
    <p>“We have been de­clared a red zone. This is not good, es­pe­cially when we are look­ing at re­open­ing the bor­der for work­ers soon,” he said, adding that Sin­ga­pore has man­aged to bring its daily Covid-19 cases down to sin­gle dig­its.</p>
    <p>Jo­hor Baru dis­trict has been de­clared a red zone af­ter more than 40 coro­n­avirus cases were logged in the last 14 days.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay hoped every­one would com­ply with rules, such as main­tain­ing ap­pro­pri­ate dis­tanc­ing and wear­ing masks, when­ever they are out, say­ing that Jo­hor’s econ­omy has been badly af­fected since the bor­der clo­sure on March 18.</p>
    <p>“If the gov­ern­ment an­nounces a con­di­tional move­ment con­trol or­der (MCO), sim­i­lar to the Klang Val­ley, here in Jo­hor Baru, we are all go­ing to be in se­ri­ous trou­ble.”</p>
    <p>Jo­hor Baru Chi­nese Cham­ber of Com­merce and In­dus­try pres­i­dent Low Kueck Shin said sac­ri­fices must be made to keep the num­bers down.</p>
    <p>“We need to work re­ally hard to en­sure the num­bers do not go up in the months to come. This is cru­cial for the state’s econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“Sac­ri­fices such as lim­it­ing un­nec­es­sary trav­els must be made,” he said, adding that busi­nesses in Jo­hor Baru would be hard hit if the dis­trict re­mained a red zone for some time or if a con­di­tional MCO (CMCO) was im­ple­mented.</p>
    <p>Malaysian Tourist Guides Coun­cil pres­i­dent Jimmy Leong urged the pub­lic, in­clud­ing tourism in</p>
    <p>dus­try play­ers, to con­tinue fol­low­ing health pro­to­cols strictly.</p>
    <p>Jo­hor Health and En­vi­ron­ment com­mit­tee chair­man R. Vidyanan­than said Jo­hor Baru dis­trict was de­clared a red zone last Thurs­day, with 65 ac­tive Covid-19 cases re­ported by then.</p>
    <p>“Ten new Covid-19 cases were re­ported on Thurs­day, in­clud­ing nine cases from ex­ist­ing clus­ters and one from other screen­ings,” he said in a state­ment last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the state gov­ern­ment has or­dered the clo­sure of kinder­gartens, child­care cen­tres and com­mu­nity re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion cen­tres, along with chil­dren and se­nior cit­i­zens ac­tiv­ity cen­tres, as well as re­li­gious schools in the dis­trict.</p>
    <p>The Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry has shut all ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tions in the dis­trict for two weeks, start­ing from to­day.</p>
    <p>The rise in Jo­hor cases is a re­flec­tion of a Covid-19 surge in Malaysia</p>
    <p>in the last few weeks.</p>
    <p>The fed­eral ter­ri­to­ries of Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya, and Se­lan­gor and Sabah states have been placed un­der a CMCO, which re­stricts in­ter-dis­trict travel and bans large gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>Malaysia yes­ter­day re­ported 659 new Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours, with eastern Sabah re­port­ing 529, or 80.3 per cent. There were zero new cases re­ported for Jo­hor.</p>
    <p>Jo­hor Baru dis­trict has been de­clared a red zone af­ter this num­ber of coro­n­avirus cases were logged in the last 14 days.</p>

If Jo&#xAD;hor Baru dis&#xAD;trict re&#xAD;mained a red zone for some time or if a con&#xAD;di&#xAD;tional move&#xAD;ment con&#xAD;trol or&#xAD;der were to be im&#xAD;ple&#xAD;mented, it would spell trou&#xAD;ble for lo&#xAD;cal busi&#xAD;nesses, in&#xAD;dus&#xAD;try lead&#xAD;ers warned.</p>
