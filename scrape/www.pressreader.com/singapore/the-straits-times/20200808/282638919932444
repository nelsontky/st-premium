    <p>The Kia Sel­tos com­petes in a rather crowded com­pact cross­over seg­ment pop­u­lated by the likes of Honda’s HR-V, Toy­ota’s C-HR, Mazda’s CX-30, MG’s HS and Hyundai’s Kona.</p>
    <p>The ini­tial launch vari­ant is the top GT Line, with a 1.4-litre turbo en­gine mated to a seven-speed dual-clutch trans­mis­sion – the same driv­e­train as the Hyundai i30’s if it is re­turned for sport util­ity ve­hi­cle (SUV) du­ties.</p>
    <p>It pro­duces 140hp, 11hp more than the i30.</p>
    <p>Do not ex­pect it to han­dle like a nim­ble hatch­back, though. The sus­pen­sion set-up is com­fort-bi­ased, cou­pled with high side­wall tyres for good bump ab­sorp­tion over patch­work city roads.</p>
    <p>The Sel­tos is not lack­ing in ac­cel­er­a­tion, though, es­pe­cially in Sport mode. Just do not get too ex­u­ber­ant along wind­ing roads. If un­der-steer roll around fast bends – typ­i­cal of SUVs – does not dis­cour­age you to back off on the ac­cel­er­a­tor, the numb power steer­ing cer­tainly will.</p>
    <p>As a cross­over, the Sel­tos has a few tricks up its sleeves. Apart from</p>
    <p>Eco, Nor­mal and Sport driv­ing modes, it has Mud, Snow and Sand ter­rain modes. These give it some off-road cred, even if the car is merely a front-wheel-drive.</p>
    <p>Fuel econ­omy-wise, the car man­aged 7.6 litres/100km over 80km of mostly high­way driv­ing – not far off Kia’s claimed 6.3 litres.</p>
    <p>The Sel­tos scores on its ath­letic good looks. Pro­ject­ing an out­doorsy image is a bold up­right face, with Kia’s sig­na­ture “tiger nose” grille flanked by full LED head­lights. Else­where, rugged mat­tblack plas­tic clad the lower sills and wheel arches.</p>
    <p>More sporty ac­cents can be found in the mod­ern cabin, such as red stitch­ing trim and “GT Line” em­bossed on the front seats and steer­ing wheel. It gets a classy leather-wrapped helm, which looks to be Mercedes-Benz-in­spired, down to the multi-func­tion con­trols.</p>
    <p>For wow fac­tor, there are fea­tures more com­monly found in pre­mium cars. Wire­less charg­ing, ven­ti­lated front seats, rear-door win­dow sun­shades and a sun­roof are stan­dard-is­sue.</p>
    <p>Ei­ther an 8-inch or 10.25-inch in­fo­tain­ment screen with Ap­ple CarPlay and An­droid Auto con­nec­tiv­ity takes cen­tre stage on the dash.</p>
    <p>Other frills in­clude mu­sic-pul­sat­ing mood light­ing for the front door speak­ers (barely vis­i­ble in day­light), and a pop-up head-up dis­play.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, the cabin is lined with rather cheap-look­ing hard plas­tics.</p>
    <p>The sin­gle-zone au­to­matic air­con­di­tioner with rear vents is su­per ef­fi­cient, ca­pa­ble of cool­ing the in­te­rior on hot days even at its low­est fan speed.</p>
    <p>The 433-litre boot gets a bumper sill-level floor­board, mak­ing it easy to slide heav­ier ob­jects in and out. Rear seat­backs can be low­ered to in­crease stowage ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the Kia Sel­tos is a prac­ti­cal all-rounder with am­ple space, de­cent pace and a com­fort­able ride suited for Sin­ga­pore’s ur­ban jun­gle.</p>
    <p>From $112,999, it stands out as a value buy, with its sporty trim and nifty pre­mium fea­tures.</p>
    <p>The GT Line will be joined by an SX vari­ant at about $5,000 less and a base EX vari­ant at $15,000 or so less.</p>
