    <p>Mil­lions of Australian­s have rushed to with­draw a to­tal of A$33.3 bil­lion (S$32.2 bil­lion) from their re­tire­ment sav­ings un­der a con­tro­ver­sial scheme that allows peo­ple strug­gling fi­nan­cially due to the Covid-19 pan­demic to raid their nest eggs.</p>
    <p>As the na­tion went into lock­down ear­lier this year, the fed­eral gov­ern­ment de­cided to al­low those who were unem­ployed, had lost their jobs or whose hours had been re­duced by at least 20 per cent to ac­cess up to A$20,000 from their com­pul­sory su­per­an­nu­a­tion, or re­tire­ment sav­ings.</p>
    <p>The fi­nan­cial ser­vices reg­u­la­tor, the Aus­tralian Pru­den­tial Reg­u­la­tion Author­ity, re­vealed on Mon­day that up to 3.2 mil­lion Australian­s had ap­plied to ac­cess some of their sav­ings. Most are be­lieved to be younger Australian­s.</p>
    <p>As at Sept 13, A$33.3 bil­lion had been with­drawn.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment in­tro­duced the scheme in April and ini­tially planned to end it on Sept 24. But the scheme has since been ex­tended un­til Dec 31.</p>
    <p>Su­per­an­nu­a­tion funds and some econ­o­mists have con­demned the scheme, say­ing that younger Australian­s who tap it will be en­dan­ger­ing their fu­ture re­tire­ment in­come.</p>
    <p>Many peo­ple with­drew funds af­ter the share mar­ket plunged in April. Cal­cu­la­tions by In­dus­try Su­per Aus­tralia, which man­ages col­lec­tive pro­grammes on be­half of the 15 in­dus­try funds, show that a 25-year-old who with­draws A$20,000 from his re­tire­ment sav­ings now will have A$95,696 less when he re­tires.</p>
    <p>Dr An­drew Charl­ton, an econ­o­mist who was an ad­viser to for­mer prime min­is­ter Kevin Rudd, said many Australian­s had ac­cessed their re­tire­ment sav­ings for “con­ve­nience rather than ne­ces­sity”.</p>
    <p>He noted that younger Australian­s tended to pay lit­tle at­ten­tion to their re­tire­ment sav­ings and were the big­gest group to make with­drawals un­der the scheme, yet would “lose the most from decades of fore­gone re­turns”.</p>
    <p>“Su­per­an­nu­a­tion is for re­tire­ment, not crises, and it can’t do both – once money is with­drawn, it’s gone,” Dr Charl­ton, now a di­rec­tor of con­sul­tancy firm Al­phaBeta, wrote in The Syd­ney Morn­ing Herald ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>“In­stead of help­ing peo­ple with fi­nan­cial hard­ship, the pol­icy is kick­ing that hard­ship down the road,” he added.</p>
    <p>In Aus­tralia, em­ploy­ers must make com­pul­sory con­tri­bu­tions to the su­per­an­nu­a­tion funds of their em­ploy­ees, amount­ing to 9.5 per cent of their in­comes. Th­ese funds can­not be ac­cessed un­til they re­tire or un­til they are aged 65.</p>
    <p>The con­ser­va­tive Lib­eral-Na­tional gov­ern­ment has de­fended the de­ci­sion to al­low peo­ple to ac­cess their funds, say­ing the money be­longs to those who with­draw it and should be ac­ces­si­ble due to the cur­rent eco­nomic chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>But the op­po­si­tion Labor Party has at­tacked the de­ci­sion, say­ing most of those with­draw­ing funds are aged un­der 35 and will have with­drawn much or all of their sav­ings.</p>
    <p>A 57-year-old from Mel­bourne, Ms Jus­tine Cole­man, said she with­drew A$10,000 from her su­per­an­nu­a­tion be­cause her bank bal­ance was “close to ground zero”. She said she has been unem­ployed since late last year.</p>
    <p>“It up­sets me, to be honest, that so many of us were forced into dip­ping into our su­per,” she told ABC News.</p>
    <p>As at yes­ter­day, Aus­tralia had recorded 27,000 cases of Covid-19 and 869 deaths.</p>
    <p>A re­cent study con­ducted by the ARC Cen­tre of Ex­cel­lence in Pop­u­la­tion Age­ing Re­search and the su­per­an­nu­a­tion fund Cbus found that many peo­ple who with­drew from their re­tire­ment sav­ings showed lit­tle aware­ness of or con­cern about the long-term con­se­quences.</p>
    <p>The study was based on sur­veys of 3,000 peo­ple who with­drew funds. About 30 per cent were un­sure of, or un­con­cerned about, the con­se­quences of their with­drawal.</p>
    <p>And about 50 per cent ei­ther un­der­es­ti­mated or did not es­ti­mate the im­pact of their with­drawal on their su­per­an­nu­a­tion bal­ance at re­tire­ment.</p>
