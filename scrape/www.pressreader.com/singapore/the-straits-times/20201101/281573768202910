    <p>Re­tiree Serene Tan was on a mis­sion when she vis­ited the Robin­sons out­let at Raffles City Shop­ping Cen­tre yes­ter­day, a day af­ter the 162-year-old depart­ment store an­nounced it would close its last two stores here.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan, who de­clined to give her age, was there to say good­bye to Ms Janet Chng, the Shi­seido counter chief there.</p>
    <p>“She’s very nice to talk to. I was afraid I would not be able to find her af­ter the store closes,” said Ms Tan, who has known Ms Chng since 2018 and has been a re­turn­ing cus­tomer since.</p>
    <p>Ms Chng, 52, said other cus­tomers had mes­saged her to ask if she was okay af­ter Robin­sons an­nounced on Fri­day that it would close its stores at The Heeren and Raffles City.</p>
    <p>Their con­cern was not a sur­prise to her as she and the cus­tomers un­der­stand one an­other very well, said Ms Chng, who will be re­de­ployed to an­other store.</p>
    <p>She has been a Shi­seido pro­moter at Robin­sons for 17 years.</p>
    <p>“The Robin­sons staff and pro­mot­ers are like fam­ily. I am very happy work­ing here, this is our sec­ond home,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Chng added that many staff and pro­mot­ers put up a brave front af­ter learn­ing of the clo­sures. “They keep it to them­selves. Once one tears up, every­one will tear up.</p>
    <p>Robin­sons said on Fri­day that it had de­cided to liq­ui­date its stores ow­ing to fac­tors like chang­ing con­sumer tastes and cost pres­sures such as rent.</p>
    <p>Ap­pointed liq­uida­tor Kor­daMen­tha will take con­trol of Robin­sons’ as­sets and as­sess the op­tions to re­alise value to max­imise re­turns to cred­i­tors.</p>
    <p>The re­tailer said it plans to do its best to trans­fer its staff to other brands un­der its par­ent com­pany, the Dubai-based Al-Fut­taim Group­which owns other fran­chises, in­clud­ing Marks & Spencer and Zara.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, shop­pers turned up in droves at Robin­sons’ two out­lets, which were vis­i­bly more packed than on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>A queue of about 300 peo­ple had formed out­side its store at The Heeren in Or­chard Road be­fore it opened at 11am.</p>
    <p>The queue stretched past the Ap­ple store down the road and snaked around the empty space in front of the mall sev­eral times.</p>
    <p>At the Raffles City out­let, about 150 peo­ple were queue­ing out­side the store at around 3pm.</p>
    <p>The crowds came de­spite there be­ing no clos­ing-down sale yet. There were, how­ever, co-pro­mo­tions and dis­counts for some brands.</p>
    <p>Robin­sons said yes­ter­day that it is work­ing with the land­lords to ar­range for an or­derly sale of stock.</p>
    <p>“We hope to be able to pro­vide de­tails of planned sales mov­ing for­ward, very shortly,” it added.</p>
    <p>The two stores’ last day is un­clear. Robin­sons has said it hopes to stay open “for the com­ing weeks”.</p>
    <p>Some cus­tomers were anx­ious about de­posits and pre-pay­ments made for mat­tresses.</p>
    <p>In a no­tice at its Raffles City store, the re­tailer ac­knowl­edged the wor­ries and said it is “sched­ul­ing meet­ings with mat­tress sup­pli­ers on an ur­gent ba­sis” to try to ad­dress the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The re­tailer added that it would no­tify af­fected cus­tomers once it resolves the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>There were many empty shelves at both stores when The Sun­day Times vis­ited yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Shortly af­ter Robin­sons an­nounced the clo­sure on Fri­day, pro­mot­ers were seen pack­ing up their goods to send them back to ware­houses.</p>
    <p>They had been told to do so by the brands that hire them.</p>
    <p>Ms Win­nie Teo, 35, who has spent 10 years work­ing in var­i­ous Robin­sons out­lets as a pro­moter for a bed sheet re­tailer, said that ru­mours were al­ready swirling among pro­mot­ers about the im­pend­ing clo­sure two months ago.</p>
    <p>Like Ms Chng, she will be re­de­ployed to other stores that stock her brand’s prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>But un­cer­tainty hangs over Robin­sons’ 175 em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>A 69-year-old cashier, who de­clined to be named, said she does not know if she can keep her job.</p>
    <p>The cashier, who has worked at Robin­sons for nearly 50 years, said “it was hard to ac­cept” the clo­sure.</p>
    <p>She will be missed by cus­tomer Faith Tok, 30. Ms Tok said the cashier had wrapped a baby car­rier she bought for her brother last month. The wrap­ping was very nicely done, said Ms Tok, who works in fi­nance.</p>
    <p>An­other cus­tomer who sang the praises of Robin­sons staff was 85-year-old re­tiree C. Yong, who waited 40 min­utes to en­ter the Raffles City store.</p>
    <p>“Even though other stores may have sim­i­lar of­fer­ings, we pre­fer Robin­sons,” Mrs Yong said.</p>
    <p>“There is a depth of sin­cer­ity their staff have that you can’t find else­where,” she said. “There is noth­ing like Robin­sons... If not, why would I take the time to queue up?”</p>
