    <p>MID­SOM­MAR (above) M18, 145 min­utes, 2019</p>
    <p>Hor­ror can hap­pen in day­light, in a place filled with gen­tle peo­ple wear­ing flow­ers and singing folk songs. That is the premise of writer-di­rec­tor Ari Aster and he makes good on the idea. When a group of out­siders visit a Swedish com­mune, they thought they were sign­ing up for a trip filled with learning and heal­ing. In­stead, they find a vil­lage steeped in prac­tices that have died out in the world at large long ago.</p>
    <p>SHEEP WITH­OUT A SHEP­HERD PG13, 112min­utes, 2019</p>
    <p>This Chi­nese thriller fea­tures Joan Chen as a Thai po­lice in­spec­tor look­ing into the dis­ap­pear­ance of her son. One of the chief sus­pects is a Chi­nese ex­pat fam­ily who have lived in north­ern Thai­land for over a decade, run­ning an In­ter­net cafe. A game of cat-and-mouse en­sues be­tween the cop and the fam­ily. This re­make of the 2013 Malay­alam-lan­guage movie Dr­ishyam was one of the top-gross­ing films in China last year.</p>
    <p>NC16, 108 min­utes, 2019</p>
    <p>This South Korean miss­ing-child thriller, called “not for the faint-hearted” by The Hol­ly­wood Re­porter, stars Lee Young-ae (above) as a mother who has never given up hope of find­ing her son who van­ished 14 years ago. The woman, who still puts up posters of her miss­ing child, one day re­ceives a clue that proves her in­stincts are right – her son is still alive, some­where.</p>
    <p>Rentals are priced at $5.98. The movies are avail­able to watch within a 14-day pe­riod at cathaycine­home.com</p>
