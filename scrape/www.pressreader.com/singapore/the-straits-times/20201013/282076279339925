    <p>Stu­dents will have to learn how to learn rather than fo­cus on skills and spe­cific tools as most con­tent will be ob­so­lete in two years or less, said the head of com­put­ing gi­ant Nvidia’s ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) tech­nol­ogy cen­tre Si­mon See.</p>
    <p>“Tech­nol­ogy is mov­ing so fast, you have to keep adopt­ing new skills,” he said. “What you have to learn is the method­ol­ogy of learn­ing new things.”</p>
    <p>Dr See was speak­ing at a panel dis­cus­sion at the launch of Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s (NTU) Deep Learn­ing Week yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter-in-charge of the Smart Na­tion Ini­tia­tive Vi­vian Balakrishn­an was the guest of hon­our.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing over a video call to stu­dents, staff, alumni and mem­bers of the pub­lic, Dr Balakrishn­an em­pha­sised the need for univer­sity stu­dents to de­velop “deep tech­ni­cal skills” in ar­eas such as data an­a­lyt­ics, ma­chine learn­ing and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI).</p>
    <p>“You are the dy­namos that will drive our trans­for­ma­tion and push the bound­aries of how we can lever­age tech­nol­ogy to transform our econ­omy – and make a real dif­fer­ence,” he added.</p>
    <p>This is the sec­ond edi­tion of NTU’s Deep Learn­ing Week, which is or­gan­ised an­nu­ally by the Ma­chine Learn­ing and Data An­a­lyt­ics Lab at the NTU School of Elec­tri­cal and Elec­tronic En­gi­neer­ing (EEE).</p>
    <p>It started yes­ter­day and will run till Sun­day, and will have AI-re­lated work­shops as well as a vir­tual AI ca­reer fair for stu­dents, end­ing with a ma­chine learn­ing hackathon themed “AI in busi­ness and eco­nomics”, NTU said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The panel dis­cussed the im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic on the econ­omy and dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion, but agreed that while Covid-19 forced com­pa­nies to speed up, most trends were al­ready in mo­tion since last year.</p>
    <p>Pan­el­lists also em­pha­sised that pas­sion was more im­por­tant than an aca­demic back­ground when pur­su­ing a ca­reer in AI.</p>
    <p>Along with Dr See, the other mem­bers of the panel in­cluded Mr Sim Kai, deputy di­rec­tor of the na­tional AI of­fice, Dr Lau­rence Liew, di­rec­tor for AI in­dus­try in­no­va­tion at AI Sin­ga­pore, Ms Jane Shen, chief sci­en­tist and man­ag­ing di­rec­tor at Pensees, Dr Pan Yaozhang, head of data sci­ence at Shopee, and Dr Yap Kim Hui, as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor at EEE.</p>
    <p>The ses­sion was mod­er­ated by Dr Wes­ley Tan, se­nior lec­turer at EEE.</p>
    <p>Dr Liew said that com­puter sci­en­tists formed a mi­nor­ity of ap­pli­cants for his or­gan­i­sa­tion’s AI ap­pren­tice­ship pro­gramme, and that he had so­cial sci­en­tists and many peo­ple from other dis­ci­plines ap­ply­ing and do­ing well.</p>
    <p>“A lot of the most suc­cess­ful tech peo­ple in the world do not come from a com­puter sci­ence back­ground.</p>
    <p>“It doesn’t re­ally mat­ter what your first de­gree is in, as long as you are pas­sion­ate, you can get into AI,” he said.</p>
