    <p>Un­her­alded golfer Sophia Popov’s win at the Women’s Bri­tish Open on Sun­day is proof that “any­thing is pos­si­ble” is no empty slo­gan, writes as­sis­tant sports ed­i­tor Ro­hit Bri­j­nath, as the 304th-ranked player in the world over­came nu­mer­ous ob­sta­cles to win the big­gest tro­phy, and pay cheque, of her sport­ing ca­reer.</p>
    <p>If you want to know what sport means to ath­letes, just look at Sophia Popov’s tear-stained face. If you wish to even par­tially un­der­stand the tests that ath­letes en­dure, just lis­ten to her break­ing voice.</p>
    <p>Af­ter she strikes her sec­ond-last putt at the Women’s Bri­tish Open and knows that vic­tory is as­sured, the world No. 304 cov­ers her eyes and cries at the un­likely bril­liance she has wrought.</p>
    <p>When she, who’s never won ex­cept on a small tour in the western US, taps in her win­ning putt at a Ma­jor, she weeps and asks her play­ing part­ner, Min­jee Lee, “Can we, like, hug?” She’s ask­ing for per­mis­sion in a Covid world and yet it sounds like an over­come young woman just need­ing a hug.</p>
    <p>When she, who lost her LPGA Tour card last year, is later told she is now a full mem­ber of the Tour, she says “Oh my God” and turns away and tries to com­pose her­self. “I’m not go­ing to cry”, she says but a voice nearby says, “You’re al­lowed” and you bet she is.</p>
    <p>And then, fi­nally, when she stands be­fore the mi­cro­phone at the tro­phy pre­sen­ta­tion, her eyes flood and her voice shakes. The last event she won, on the Cac­tus Tour, had a win­ner’s prize money of US$2,300 (S$3,150). Here it is US$675,000. It is an ad­e­quate rep­re­sen­ta­tion of the dis­tance she has come.</p>
    <p>Sun­day was a study in faith on a course – the Royal Troon – that golfers con­sider a piece of holy land. Faith that Popov had in her­self and the faith that other play­ers will take from her. The road from no­body to some­body is vast and bumpy and yet it can be ne­go­ti­ated.</p>
    <p>We spend our lives cap­ti­vated by the gifted and fa­mous, yet it is the out­sider’s oc­ca­sional tri­umph which moves us. The mas­ter­ful ath­lete awes us, the out­sider ro­mances us. One raises sport, the other sus­tains it. One prefers the dic­ta­tor­ship of dom­i­nance, the other re­minds the field this is a democ­racy. Any­one can win.</p>
    <p>Popov, 27, is the story every ath­lete should read be­cause she’s not some prodigy or spon­sored favourite but a lower-ranked sur­vivor who held onto the strands of hope. If Tiger Woods is unique, Popov is im­itable. No one looks at him and thinks, “If he can, so can I”, but that is pre­cisely the mus­cu­lar mes­sage of her vic­tory.</p>
    <p>She’s an am­bas­sador for golf’s un­no­ticed strug­glers, whose names ring no faint bell and whose faces adorn no bill­board. When she says “I al­most quit last year”, the oth­ers know ex­actly what she’s talk­ing about. Sport keeps bul­ly­ing those in the shad­ows, yet they keep work­ing to find their way into the light. That is a grand con­test in it­self.</p>
    <p>Popov is the spokesman for the un­her­alded be­cause, like them, she’s faced “a lot of ob­sta­cles”. For some young ath­letes this ob­sta­cle is debt, the death of a par­ent, the as­sault of doubt or per­sis­tent in­juries. For her it was six years, 20 doc­tor vis­its and over 10kg lost be­fore she was di­ag­nosed with Lyme dis­ease. At the Open, let’s be clear, she was de­feat­ing more than a field of play­ers.</p>
    <p>On any sport­ing tour, the greats aside, ev­ery­one has roughly the same mea­sure of abil­ity, sep­a­rated only by the small, shift­ing mar­gins of luck, con­fi­dence, trust, work ethic. It’s not that they don’t play well, it’s often about when they play well, about find­ing con­fi­dence on a Sun­day as Popov did, rid­ing a hot put­ter, keep­ing calm, ris­ing to the mo­ment.</p>
    <p>The greats, said Popov, “are al­ways in con­tention” on any given week. Class is built from con­sis­tency. But, she added, “there are so many other play­ers out there that can make it on any given week and I want them to know that and have the con­fi­dence that they can do it, too”.</p>
    <p>And so this is who Popov was on Sun­day, not just a per­son but an of­fer­ing of proof. “Any­thing is pos­si­ble” is an empty slo­gan till some­one proves it dur­ing a con­test and turns it into an ar­ti­cle of faith. She might have snatched a Ma­jor from her peers but she has also given them some­thing: The con­vic­tion that, ir­re­spec­tive of rank­ing, they have one mag­i­cal week in them. Not ev­ery­one will even­tu­ally win – there aren’t enough tro­phies – but it’s about be­liev­ing in the idea of it.</p>
    <p>When the golf­ing was done, Popov ar­rived at the cer­e­mony with a grin on her face. In a time of Covid, with the ac­cent on min­i­mal con­tact, an of­fi­cial in­di­cated that she lift the tro­phy her­self from the ta­ble. And so she did and it was a sym­bol­i­cally pow­er­ful mo­ment be­cause, like on the course, no one had handed her any­thing. Vic­tory was not given, only tear­fully seized.</p>
    <p>We spend our lives cap­ti­vated by the gifted and fa­mous, yet it is the out­sider’s oc­ca­sional tri­umph which moves us. The mas­ter­ful ath­lete awes us, the out­sider ro­mances us. One raises sport, the other sus­tains it. One prefers the dic­ta­tor­ship of dom­i­nance, the other re­minds the field this is a democ­racy. Any­one can win.</p>
