    <p>Two min­is­te­rial state­ments in Par­lia­ment on Mon­day un­der­lined the uni­fied ap­proach be­ing taken to roll out the vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme and the need for cal­i­brat­ing the mo­men­tum of Sin­ga­pore’s grad­ual open­ing up to the world. The em­pha­sis is still on a cau­tion­ary ap­proach to the han­dling of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. Even as the au­thor­i­ties fine-tune the evolv­ing bal­ance be­tween an in­creas­ingly vac­ci­nated pub­lic and lib­er­alised for­eign travel, for ex­am­ple, Sin­ga­pore­ans owe it to them­selves to em­brace the op­por­tu­nity that is pro­vided by in­oc­u­la­tion while con­tin­u­ing to ob­serve ev­ery­day pro­to­cols of so­cial be­hav­iour that are es­sen­tial to their safety. Any let­ting up on the pub­lic vig­i­lance would set so­ci­ety back.</p>
    <p>On the in­oc­u­la­tion front, a vac­cine will be used only if it is as­sessed to be suf­fi­ciently ef­fi­ca­cious and safe, and only if the ben­e­fits of the vac­cine are as­sessed to out­weigh the risks of any po­ten­tial ad­verse ef­fects from the vac­ci­na­tion. The Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine has been put through a rig­or­ous re­view process and has been au­tho­rised for use. The Moderna and Si­no­vac vac­cines are un­der­go­ing the same strin­gent re­view process. This safe­guard should help to ease the con­cerns of Sin­ga­pore­ans who might pre­fer one vac­cine over an­other be­cause of per­sonal per­cep­tions of their vary­ing ef­fi­cacy and safety.</p>
    <p>Al­low­ing in­di­vid­u­als to choose would bur­den an al­ready com­plex vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme, given that the main task is to cover the en­tire pop­u­la­tion as ef­fi­ciently as pos­si­ble. Here, it is some­what trou­bling that sur­veys and other of­fi­cial out­reach meth­ods in­di­cate that while nearly 60 per cent of peo­ple will will­ingly get in­oc­u­lated once a vac­cine is avail­able, about a third pre­fer to wait for more data be­fore de­cid­ing. In mat­ters of pub­lic health, there is a need to de­fer to sci­en­tific con­clu­sions reached by com­pe­tent au­thor­i­ties. Vac­ci­na­tions are not com­pul­sory, but their na­tional pur­pose would be un­der­cut should a sub­stan­tial num­ber here de­cide to ab­stain from them. It is to be hoped that more peo­ple will be con­vinced of the value of in­oc­u­la­tion to them­selves and to others as the pro­gramme moves beyond its ini­tial, most vul­ner­a­ble, ben­e­fi­cia­ries to em­brace larger swathes of the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The question of whether bor­der mea­sures could be re­laxed for vac­ci­nated per­sons is also be­ing stud­ied. A de­ci­sion would de­pend on the de­gree to which vac­ci­na­tion, while pro­tect­ing an in­di­vid­ual, can re­duce the risk of trans­mis­sion of the virus as well. For the time be­ing, it makes sense to sub­ject vac­ci­nated trav­ellers to pre­vail­ing bor­der mea­sures and other re­quire­ments. The same cau­tion needs to pre­vail within Sin­ga­pore, too. Safe dis­tanc­ing rules that are ob­served scrupu­lously help to raise the gen­eral level of pro­tec­tion from Covid-19. Ev­ery breach in that de­fence is cause for con­cern.</p>
