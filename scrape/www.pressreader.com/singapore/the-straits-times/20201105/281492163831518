    <p>Phase three of the na­tion’s re­open­ing in the wake of Covid-19 could last a year or more, Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong told Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ms Cheng Li Hui (Tampines GRC) had asked about phase three, in­clud­ing what fac­tors are taken into ac­count when de­cid­ing on the max­i­mum num­ber of peo­ple al­lowed for var­i­ous events, what safe­guards will be put in place when ac­tiv­i­ties re­sume on a larger scale, and what might hap­pen if cases were to surge again.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan replied that phase three – which Sin­ga­pore could move into by the year end if the virus re­mains un­der con­trol here – would not be a re­turn to pre-Covid-19 days. It will last un­til the rest of the world has the virus un­der tight con­trol or when ef­fec­tive treat­ments or vac­cines are widely avail­able.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan said group size lim­its de­pend on fac­tors such as how fre­quently an ac­tiv­ity takes place, what po­ten­tial risks it has, and whether ad­di­tional safety mea­sures can be im­ple­mented to mit­i­gate such risks.</p>
    <p>Point­ing to the large clus­ters of Covid-19 cases that had formed dur­ing events like the Safra Jurong din­ner and the Mei Hwan Drive Chi­nese New Year gath­er­ing, Mr Gan said: “The prob­a­bil­ity of trans­mis­sion tends to be higher in so­cial set­tings... (as) it is nat­u­ral to lower our guard when we are among fam­ily and friends.”</p>
    <p>He noted that hav­ing meals in a group raises the risk of trans­mis­sion as masks are re­moved while eat­ing and drink­ing.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tion­ally, many peo­ple go out for meals al­most ev­ery day with dif­fer­ent groups, fur­ther mul­ti­ply­ing the risk.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties are cur­rently con­sid­er­ing in­creas­ing group size lim­its from five to eight in phase three.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan said that be­fore the pan­demic, ban­quet ta­bles used to have a ca­pac­ity of about 10 peo­ple – so the new limit of eight is the max­i­mum that such ta­bles can take while al­low­ing for ad­di­tional safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>He noted that gath­er­ings of any size pose a risk of Covid-19 trans­mis­sion, but at the same time, it is “not ten­able nor de­sir­able” to ban so­cial gath­er­ings for a long pe­riod of time.</p>
    <p>Al­low­ing gath­er­ings of up to eight in phase three will strike a bal­ance be­tween main­tain­ing safe dis­tance and per­mit­ting larger groups to meet, he said.</p>
    <p>He added that larger group sizes can be al­lowed in set­tings where safe man­age­ment mea­sures can be put in place. These in­clude wed­dings, which are still con­sid­ered high-risk and have re­sulted in clus­ters across the world.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan noted that there have</p>
    <p>REACH­ING A STEADY STATE</p>
    <p>Our ob­jec­tive in phase three is to reach a steady state of per­mit­ted eco­nomic and so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties un­til an ef­fec­tive vac­cine or treat­ment is widely avail­able... Should there be a spike in cases, we need to re­spond swiftly and de­ci­sively. We can­not rule out the need to reim­pose mea­sures or in­tro­duce new mea­sures in or­der to keep the virus un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>HEALTH MIN­IS­TER GAN KIM YONG</p>
    <p>been re­quests to raise the cap on the num­ber of wed­ding par­tic­i­pants. So ad­di­tional mea­sures have al­ready been put in place, in­clud­ing keep­ing guests from min­gling be­yond groups of five at their ta­bles, and en­sur­ing they use SafeEn­try and TraceTo­gether.</p>
    <p>Test­ing and con­tact trac­ing are the two keys to al­low­ing more ac­tiv­i­ties to re­sume, the min­is­ter said.</p>
    <p>On test­ing, he said pre-event test­ing is be­ing pi­loted to al­low high­er­risk ac­tiv­i­ties such as wed­dings to scale up safely, by re­duc­ing the chance of a Covid-19 case be­ing present at the event.</p>
    <p>On con­tact trac­ing, Mr Gan said the au­thor­i­ties are pro­gres­sively rolling out TraceTo­gether-only SafeEn­try to en­sure that all those who are vis­it­ing places where they are likely to be in con­tact with many oth­ers for pro­longed pe­ri­ods, or where hu­man traf­fic is high, have the TraceTo­gether app or to­ken. This will help speed up con­tact trac­ing ef­forts and pro­vide any­one who be­comes in­fected with early med­i­cal care.</p>
    <p>“Our ob­jec­tive in phase three is to reach a steady state of per­mit­ted eco­nomic and so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties un­til an ef­fec­tive vac­cine or treat­ment is widely avail­able,” Mr Gan said.</p>
