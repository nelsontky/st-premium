    <p>Prop­erty giant Cap­i­taLand ex­pects its fi­nan­cial per­for­mance for the cur­rent fi­nan­cial year to be ma­te­ri­ally ad­versely im­pacted, de­spite see­ing signs of re­cov­ery in op­er­at­ing met­rics for the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>The group said in a busi­ness up­date on Tues­day evening that this fol­lows the “sig­nif­i­cantly re­duced” prof­its in the first half of this year aris­ing from a sub­dued op­er­at­ing en­vi­ron­ment, lower-than-ex­pected cap­i­tal re­cy­cling, year-end reval­u­a­tions of the group’s in­vest­ment port­fo­lio, and im­pair­ment assess­ment for eq­uity in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, the com­pany an­nounced the re­tire­ment of chair­man Ng Kee Choe, who has been on its board since April 2010. He will step down at the con­clu­sion of its next an­nual gen­eral meet­ing sched­uled for April next year, and will be suc­ceeded by Mr Miguel Ko, deputy chair­man of the group.</p>
    <p>Cap­i­taLand said it still ex­pects to de­liver pos­i­tive cash prof­its for FY2020 from its diver­si­fied op­er­at­ing in­come streams, adding that its fi­nan­cial po­si­tion “re­mains re­silient”.</p>
    <p>It pre­vi­ously re­ported an 89 per cent year-on-year drop in net profit to $96.6 mil­lion for the fis­cal first-half ended June.</p>
    <p>There were en­cour­ag­ing signs of re­cov­ery in the third quar­ter as the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion im­proved glob­ally, with op­er­at­ing met­rics im­prov­ing on a quar­terly ba­sis, noted the group, es­pe­cially in the res­i­den­tial, re­tail and lodg­ing seg­ments.</p>
    <p>These seg­ments were hit hard­est by Covid-19 mit­i­ga­tion mea­sures ear­lier this year, when res­i­den­tial sales of­fices were forced to close, non-es­sen­tial re­tail trades were un­able to op­er­ate, and oc­cu­pancy of lodg­ing as­sets was re­duced due to travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Cap­i­taLand said that in the res­i­den­tial seg­ment, unit han­dovers were back on track in China and Viet­nam. The group sold over 1,900 units in China dur­ing the third quar­ter, 40 per cent higher than in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Unit han­dovers in China for the nine months ended Septem­ber ex­ceeded the prior year pe­riod in to­tal value, while its Viet­nam busi­ness saw a year-on-year tre­bling in both units and han­dover value.</p>
    <p>For the Sin­ga­pore res­i­den­tial mar­ket, Cap­i­taLand sold three times the num­ber of units dur­ing the third quar­ter, com­pared with the to­tal sold in the first half of this year. Some 131 units worth $201 mil­lion were sold in the first nine months of the year.</p>
    <p>The re­tail seg­ment saw shop­per traf­fic and ten­ant sales nar­row the gap to pre-Covid-19 lev­els for the nine months.</p>
    <p>Cap­i­taLand said the com­mit­ted oc­cu­pancy rate re­mained largely sta­ble and al­most all ten­ants have re­sumed op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Ten­ant re­ten­tion rate also re­mained high for its Sin­ga­pore port­fo­lio, at more than 80 per cent. The group has dis­bursed over $320 mil­lion in rental re­bates to ten­ants for the nine months.</p>
    <p>For the lodg­ing seg­ment, Cap­i­taLand said there was op­ti­mism with in­creas­ing re­sump­tion of do­mes­tic travel, adding that its as­set-light op­er­at­ing plat­form main­tained pos­i­tive cash flow for the nine months.</p>
    <p>Around 96 per cent of its lodg­ing prop­er­ties were op­er­a­tional as at the end of the quar­ter, with oc­cu­pancy ris­ing to around 50 per cent dur­ing the quar­ter, up from about 40 per cent in the prior pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Cap­i­taLand said that while there has been progress in the third quar­ter, over­all busi­ness and con­sumer sen­ti­ment re­mains cau­tious, given the un­even pace of re­cov­ery and con­cerns over a resur­gence in the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>For FY2021, Cap­i­taLand ex­pects the pace of the global eco­nomic re­cov­ery to re­main highly de­pen­dent on fac­tors such as a re­li­able Covid-19 vac­cine, the re­sump­tion of nor­mal in­ter­na­tional travel and the eas­ing of geopo­lit­i­cal ten­sions.</p>
    <p>“Un­til then, fi­nan­cial re­turns ex­pec­ta­tions based on pre-Covid as­sump­tions may also have to be mod­er­ated,” it said.</p>
    <p>Cap­i­taLand shares, which hit an eight-year low on Mon­day, fell 0.39 per cent yes­ter­day to close at $2.56.</p>
