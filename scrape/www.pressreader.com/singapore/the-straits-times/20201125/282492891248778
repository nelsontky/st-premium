    <p>MILAN • Real Madrid may have been Euro­pean cham­pi­ons for a record 13 times but they have never won at the San Siro since they first played there in 1966.</p>
    <p>Zine­dine Zi­dane’s side are seek­ing to erase that un­wanted mark, but the odds are against them with key first-team play­ers out of their crunch Cham­pi­ons League clash with In­ter Milan today.</p>
    <p>Real cap­tain and tal­is­man Ser­gio Ramos is on the side­lines af­ter suf­fer­ing a ham­string in­jury while the de­fender was on in­ter­na­tional duty with Spain last week.</p>
    <p>France striker Karim Ben­zema missed Satur­day’s 1-1 draw in La Liga with Vil­lar­real, and was also ab­sent from the trav­el­ling squad. Back-up striker Luka Jovic is ruled out af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>While Zi­dane is with­out his most po­tent at­tack­ing weapon and most ex­pe­ri­enced de­fender, he can call upon Casemiro.</p>
    <p>Casemiro and Eder Mil­i­tao have both re­cov­ered from Covid-19 and the for­mer linked up with the squad for the game with Vil­lar­real, al­though he was deemed not sharp enough for ac­tion.</p>
    <p>The re­turn of the 28-year-old, who played in Real’s 3-2 home win over In­ter ear­lier this month, is a huge boost as he of­fers con­trol in the mid­dle of the park.</p>
    <p>“We’re aware that there’s still a long way to go, but that win was very im­por­tant,” said Casemiro on Real’s web­site.</p>
    <p>“We know it’s a dif­fi­cult group. And In­ter are a great team, with a coach who has a very clear vi­sion of the game. But we all live and breathe the Cham­pi­ons League here and we all live to win it.”</p>
    <p>Eden Haz­ard, Na­cho Fer­nan­dez and Dani Car­va­jal also re­turned from pos­i­tive Covid tests and in­juries to play against Vil­lar­real and should be able to fea­ture today.</p>
    <p>The two sides have met seven times at the San Siro, with In­ter win­ning five and two matches end­ing in draws. In­ter have lost only two of their 21 meet­ings with Span­ish sides at home.</p>
    <p>Both teams, though, are strug­gling in Group B – Real (four points) and In­ter (two) are third and fourth re­spec­tively, with Borus­sia Monchengla­d­bach (five) and Shakhtar Donetsk (four) sur­pris­ingly ahead of the fan­cied duo.</p>
    <p>This is a win­ner-take-all con­test as a de­feat would ef­fec­tively kill any hopes of qual­i­fi­ca­tion with two games left af­ter this round.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter our pre­vi­ous re­sults, we don’t have many ways out, so this is a fi­nal,” said In­ter man­ager Antonio Conte yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We are go­ing to need seven points, maybe nine to qual­ify. This is the most dif­fi­cult group...</p>
    <p>“If we haven’t got the re­sults, it’s right to look in­side and try to un­der­stand why. By dis­play­ing hu­mil­ity and re­main­ing fo­cused, we can win the match.”</p>
