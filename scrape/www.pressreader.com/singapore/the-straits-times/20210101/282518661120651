    <p>There are de­sign­ers who cre­ate per­fectly lovely, de­sir­able clothes and then there are de­sign­ers who dig a lit­tle deeper and think a lit­tle big­ger.</p>
    <p>The works of the lat­ter camp are al­most like cul­tural mark­ers — not just re­flect­ing the mood of the times, but of­ten also help­ing to crys­tallise it and, in some cases, even shift­ing it.</p>
    <p>One of the most orig­i­nal, im­por­tant voices shap­ing the fu­ture of fash­ion to­day be­longs to Marine Serre. She burst onto the scene with a bang in 2017, her de­but col­lec­tion net­ting her the LVMH Prize.</p>
    <p>Since then, she has been gar­ner­ing both crit­i­cal and com­mer­cial suc­cess with a sin­gu­lar point of view that ex­plores ques­tions of iden­tity, flu­id­ity, di­ver­sity and sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>Call it pre­science or co­in­ci­dence, but there has al­ways been some­thing dystopian about Serre’s shows and col­lec­tions. Way be­fore any­one could have pre­dicted that face masks would be this year’s most preva­lent (and nec­es­sary) ac­ces­sory, she was al­ready putting it on her run­ways along­side bal­a­clavas, full-cov­er­age body­suits and other sur­vival gear.</p>
    <p>But it is not all doom and gloom. Serre holds out a life­line, a po­ten­tial path for­ward: From her very first col­lec­tion, she has placed up­cy­cling at the very core of her brand — with silk dresses pieced to­gether from old scarves and later, cou­ture-like mar­vels re­fash­ioned from vin­tage jacquards, blan­kets and tow­els.</p>
    <p>In a con­ver­sa­tion with deputy fash­ion ed­i­tor Priya Elan of The Guardian last year, Serre noted: “The most im­por­tant thing was try­ing to fig­ure out the prob­lem­atic pro­duc­tion process. We’re con­sum­ing so much. We felt the en­thu­si­asm about the re­gen­er­ated gar­ments. Peo­ple are like, ‘I could wear a skirt made out of car­pet, I don’t think it’s that weird’. The goal of all this is to make a bet­ter world.”</p>
    <p>As sus­tain­abil­ity be­comes an in­creas­ingly ur­gent is­sue for fash­ion to ad­dress, Serre has helped thrust up­cy­cling into the main­stream ver­nac­u­lar. This most sus­tain­able ap­proach to cre­at­ing is now be­ing prac­tised all across the fash­ion spec­trum, from in­die dar­lings such as Bode all the way to big con­glom­er­ates such as Coach.</p>
    <p>While the lux­ury in­dus­try used to scoff at any­thing last-sea­son, the pan­demic has brought about a much-needed change of per­spec­tive — clever use of dead­stock or archival fab­rics is now a virtue.</p>
    <p>SYS­TEM RE­BOOT</p>
    <p>With the pan­demic dis­rupt­ing the way peo­ple work, cre­ate and con­sume, fash­ion is now in the throes of one of its big­gest reck­on­ings ever. Shifts that were merely con­tem­plated or fan­ta­sised about be­fore this are slowly com­ing to fruition. Gucci un­der Alessan­dro Michele has al­ways dared to be more different when com­pared with its fel­low multi­bil­lion-dol­lar lux­ury brands.</p>
    <p>Feel­ing change com­ing — one in which consumers and cre­ators alike are crav­ing a slower, more thought­ful ap­proach to fash­ion — Gucci be­came one of the first big brands to an­nounce its de­par­ture from the tra­di­tional fash­ion cal­en­dar (around the same time Dries Van Noten gath­ered a group of de­sign­ers and re­tail­ers to call for a re­align­ment of when col­lec­tions are shown, de­liv­ered and dis­counted).</p>
    <p>Michele, of course, has long done away with sea­sonal dis­counts, firm in his belief that his Gucci tran­scends sea­sons. Now push­ing that train of thought fur­ther, he has chafed against the re­lent­less cy­cle of four to five run­way shows a year — some staged in far-flung lo­ca­tions to which hun­dreds fly over for just a 15-minute spec­ta­cle.</p>
    <p>And so Michele has re­cal­i­brated Gucci to a ca­dence of two col­lec­tions a year — the how and when of the show­ings left fluid and flex­i­ble. But first, a last chap­ter to close out the old way of do­ing things. In July, Michele pre­sented The Epi­logue.</p>
    <p>Ini­tially con­ceived as a cruise show in San Fran­cisco, it was staged at home in Italy in the guise of a re­al­time, sur­veil­lance-style live stream of the col­lec­tion’s cam­paign shoot.</p>
    <p>In a con­ver­sa­tion with fash­ion jour­nal­ist Alexan­der Fury ear­lier this year, Michele said: “The show has al­ways rep­re­sented an in­cred­i­bly pow­er­ful means of com­mu­ni­ca­tion. Each time, I trans­formed it to bet­ter an­swer my need to tell. But this need can now find other spa­ces, other paths. It can also rad­i­cally rein­vent it­self. What we’re liv­ing in is a gym for the imag­i­na­tion.”</p>
    <p>The first re­sult of that imag­i­na­tive ex­er­cise was un­veiled over sev­eral days i n Novem­ber as Guc­ciFest — a fash­ion and film fes­ti­val with ap­pear­ances by the likes of Harry Styles and Billie Eilish. This fes­ti­val not just show­cased Michele’s lat­est col­lec­tion, but also spotlit the works of 15 young in­de­pen­dent de­sign­ers.</p>
    <p>Now all across the i ndus­try, de­sign­ers are wak­ing up to the re­al­i­sa­tion that they do not have to be locked into a rigid sys­tem that does not work. The last Fash­ion “Month” in Septem­ber stretched out to al­most three, with Ce­line, Michael Kors and Tory Burch choos­ing to show later, and all in different for­mats, in Oc­to­ber and even Novem­ber — all the bet­ter to align the clothes they are show­ing closer to when they would be avail­able for pur­chase.</p>
    <p>Then there are those like Marc Ja­cobs, who chose to sit out Fash­ion Week en­tirely — high­light­ing the hu­man toll the pan­demic has taken on an in­dus­try driven by cre­ativ­ity and crafts­man­ship.</p>
    <p>BET­TER TO­GETHER</p>
    <p>While Gucci closed a chap­ter by reimag­in­ing what a fash­ion show can be, another Ital­ian heavy­weight opened a new one by re­mak­ing the idea of a fash­ion col­lab­o­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>Mi­lan Fash­ion Week in Septem­ber saw the de­but of Mi­uc­cia Prada and Raf Si­mons’ joint ef­fort at</p>
    <p>Prada. To­gether, they rewrote the rules of how cre­ative minds in fash­ion can work to­gether – truly and equally – beyond the one-off co-branded cap­sule.</p>
    <p>Those new rules, how­ever, are evolv­ing to meet the needs of the mo­ment. Re­spond­ing in a post­show con­ver­sa­tion to crowd­sourced ques­tions about their col­lab­o­ra­tive process, Prada said: “This is a be­gin­ning. We have time to develop, sub­tract, add and col­lab­o­rate in any way – this is the beauty of it; that we don’t know where we’re go­ing.”</p>
    <p>From Valentino’s upcoming ros­ter of Rock­stud rein­ter­preters to Emilio Pucci and Jean Paul Gaultier’s sta­bles of guest de­sign­ers, most of the col­lab­o­ra­tions at fash­ion’s high­est level right now are built on one-off part­ner­ships.</p>
    <p>It is still too early to tell, but per­haps Prada and Si­mons’ ap­proach will her­ald a new way of work­ing — one that is more re­ward­ing and sus­tain­able in the long run.</p>
    <p>BE KIND, REWIND</p>
    <p>Vir­gil Abloh was also think­ing about flex­i­bil­ity, but from another as­pect. The de­signer’s ru­mi­na­tion on the life­span of a col­lec­tion led him to the rad­i­cal idea that a col­lec­tion can keep on evolv­ing and ex­pand­ing even af­ter the lights have been turned off at the run­way show.</p>
    <p>Abloh con­ceived his spring/sum­mer 2021 menswear col­lec­tion for Louis Vuit­ton as some­thing that can shift shapes and take on new di­men­sions.</p>
    <p>What was teased in an an­i­mated film set in Paris and re­leased in July turned into a full-fledged run­way show in Shang­hai in Au­gust, which then popped up again in Tokyo in Septem­ber in a new form — with different stag­ing and new looks added.</p>
    <p>The col­lec­tion was no­table not just for its amor­phous na­ture and its ad­di­tion of new looks, but also for the way it ex­tended the shelf life of older ones. Abloh in­cor­po­rated prints and mo­tifs from his en­tire Vuit­ton oeu­vre — a bold state­ment on how good de­sign ideas don’t have to die af­ter one sea­son.</p>
    <p>A NEW DAWN</p>
    <p>No­table as Abloh’s ap­proach was, the one who has re­ally thrived in these un­prece­dented times, com­ing up with so­lu­tions as un­ex­pected as the co­nun­drum we find our­selves in, is Jonathan An­der­son. Apart from John Gal­liano (and his show-all, tell-all doc­u­men­taries for French lux­ury fash­ion house Mai­son Margiela), no other de­signer came close to tak­ing the lim­i­ta­tions of this mo­ment and chan­nelling them into pow­er­ful new work that was of the mo­ment, while tran­scend­ing it at the same time.</p>
    <p>An­der­son ar­rived at a path for­ward by cast­ing an eye to­wards the past, re­ject­ing dig­i­tal look­books and im­per­sonal films for the phys­i­cal, the tac­tile, the per­ma­nent. His “show in a box” and “show on the wall” for Loewe’s spring/sum­mer 2021 menswear and wom­enswear re­spec­tively gath­ered to­gether boxes and books, pa­pers and swatches, cutouts and fold-outs, and even scent and sound – all lov­ingly cre­ated and cu­rated.</p>
    <p>They went beyond mere show­cases of a new sea­son’s worth of clothes to be­come a ver­i­ta­ble time cap­sule of the unique ex­pe­ri­ence peo­ple are liv­ing through now.</p>
    <p>An­der­son says: “We’re now in a mo­ment where fash­ion needs to change. It needs to be about ex­plo­ration and I feel no mat­ter what hap­pens, we, as hu­mans, need tac­til­ity; we want tac­til­ity.”</p>
    <p>It is de­sign­ers like An­der­son and all the ones afore­men­tioned who are able to cut through the noise and chaos, and dis­til it into a crys­tal-clear vi­sion that will shine a way for­ward for fash­ion. They will be the light burst­ing through the dark clouds in these times.</p>
