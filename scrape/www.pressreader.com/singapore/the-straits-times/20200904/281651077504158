    <p>Young peo­ple to­day want to push for a more car­ing and in­clu­sive so­ci­ety by re­duc­ing so­cial in­equal­ity and im­prov­ing civic dis­course and par­tic­i­pa­tion, govern­ment en­gage­ment ef­forts un­der the SG Youth Ac­tion Plan last year have found.</p>
    <p>This, in turn, brings up the more fun­da­men­tal questions of what kind of so­cial com­pact and pol­i­tics Sin­ga­pore­ans want for the coun­try in the long run, Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The key is to har­ness the en­ergy of youth to bring about pos­i­tive change, in­stead of al­low­ing un­cer­tainty and dis­con­tent about their fu­ture and as­pi­ra­tions to fes­ter and re­sult in neg­a­tive con­fronta­tion, Mr Tong said on the fourth day of the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress.</p>
    <p>He out­lined two key thrusts of his min­istry’s plans on this front.</p>
    <p>First, his min­istry will work with the young to give voice to their dreams and as­pi­ra­tions, and the space and av­enues to en­gage with the rest of so­ci­ety. Sec­ond, Sin­ga­pore needs to give its youth hope of a brighter fu­ture, in­clud­ing hav­ing good jobs and good lives.</p>
    <p>The Youth Corps In­tern­ship Scheme that starts this month with 300 op­por­tu­ni­ties at so­cial and com­mu­nity groups, and a YouthTech pro­gramme to equip at least 1,000 youth with dig­i­tal skills and place­ments at such or­gan­i­sa­tions, can help pave the way to­wards more op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>On the as­pi­ra­tions of youth, Mr Tong said the Govern­ment recog­nises their chang­ing val­ues and ideals when it comes to longert­erm so­cial and po­lit­i­cal is­sues, and will work with them to bet­ter sup­port vul­ner­a­ble com­mu­ni­ties, em­brace di­verse view­points, and on other causes like the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>Build­ing a more car­ing, in­clu­sive so­ci­ety in­cludes weav­ing the ta­pes­try of Sin­ga­pore’s so­ci­ety to ac­com­mo­date its di­ver­sity of threads seam­lessly, he said. Keep­ing it to­gether is a must, for when a thread comes loose, it threat­ens the in­tegrity of that next to it and if left unchecked, could un­ravel the en­tire fab­ric.</p>
    <p>And youth must have as much of a voice in this dis­course as any­one else, he added.</p>
    <p>“While previous gen­er­a­tions might have chased the tra­di­tional 5Cs, this gen­er­a­tion is con­cerned with some other Cs – cli­mate change, con­stant com­pe­ti­tion and car­ing com­mu­ni­ties,” he said.</p>
    <p>His min­istry will also ex­pand its part­ner­ships with youth on top­ics such as the stigma as­so­ci­ated with men­tal health is­sues and en­vi­ron­men­tal sus­tain­abil­ity, said Mr Tong, who said he agrees with Ms Raeesah Khan’s (Sengkang GRC) view that youth need to have a seat at the table to look at such is­sues.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tinue to cre­ate more op­por­tu­ni­ties and av­enues for youth to part­ner the Govern­ment and so­ci­ety on is­sues that mat­ter to them, and we will do so on a reg­u­lar and sus­tained ba­sis,” said Mr Tong.</p>
    <p>They can also be given more plat­forms to have con­ver­sa­tions with older gen­er­a­tions to im­ple­ment change, while un­der­stand­ing the con­straints and trade-offs that age and ex­pe­ri­ence can some­times give a bet­ter in­sight to, he added.</p>
    <p>“The older gen­er­a­tions in turn need to be a lit­tle more pa­tient, ac­cept­ing and ap­pre­cia­tive of... dif­fer­ing views (across gen­er­a­tions as)... these shared ideas help take us for­ward.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tong also ac­knowl­edged that young peo­ple had asked “hard questions” about the fair­ness and tone of po­lit­i­cal cam­paigns at the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“They asked to see more di­verse views in Par­lia­ment, more checks and bal­ances, and more open de­bates on con­struc­tive pol­icy al­ter­na­tives. These con­cerns and questions are en­tirely valid, and re­flect the rapid changes in our eco­nomic, po­lit­i­cal and so­cial en­vi­ron­ment, am­pli­fied and catal­ysed by the cur­rent Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment does not have all the answers in the best of times, and in an un­cer­tain en­vi­ron­ment, it is all the more im­por­tant that it charts a path to­gether with the com­mu­nity to forge a way for­ward, said the min­is­ter. In the same way, Sin­ga­pore’s di­ver­sity means there will al­ways be peren­nial questions that re­volve around race and re­li­gion, but also newer, di­vi­sive and con­tentious is­sues, in­clud­ing questions con­cern­ing LGBTQ+, equal­ity and per­sonal free­doms.</p>
    <p>While it is a para­dox to keep enough space be­tween dif­fer­ent parts of the whole while build­ing a tightly knit so­ci­ety, he said, this is a para­dox Sin­ga­pore “must, can and will over­come” through re­spect and ex­pand­ing the com­mon space.</p>
    <p>All Sin­ga­pore­ans play a role in keep­ing the Sin­ga­pore Ta­pes­try from fray­ing or worse, be­ing stretched and torn apart, he said. “Yet even as there is only one ta­pes­try, we re­main in­di­vid­u­als, with our own iden­ti­ties, dreams and as­pi­ra­tions. In fact, it is this di­ver­sity of yarns that makes Sin­ga­pore ex­cit­ing and more beau­ti­ful than it would other­wise have been,” he added. “Our dif­fer­ences, our di­verse eth­nic­i­ties, cul­tures, her­itage and be­liefs, make for a col­lec­tive which is far richer, and a whole which is far greater than the sum of its parts.”</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter also noted that to­day’s youth face in­tense com­pe­ti­tion. While glob­al­i­sa­tion presents new op­por­tu­ni­ties, it also opens up aca­demic com­pe­ti­tion be­yond na­tional bound­aries. Com­pe­ti­tion for jobs and op­por­tu­ni­ties have also been ex­ac­er­bated. Sin­ga­pore has taken steps to bet­ter pro­tect Sin­ga­pore­ans, but the “hard truth” is that com­pe­ti­tion is a fact of life, and Sin­ga­pore can­not in­flu­ence the tra­jec­tory of other coun­tries, he said.</p>
    <p>“I want to en­cour­age our youth to re­alise that com­pe­ti­tion drives us to ex­cel. Com­pe­ti­tion pushes us out of our com­fort zone to be more than what we thought we could be, and re­alise a bet­ter ver­sion of our­selves,” said Mr Tong.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore also needs to re­main mer­i­to­cratic, but not os­si­fied. “The forces that en­abled the Boomers and Gen X to progress ought not be al­lowed to strat­ify so­ci­ety,” he said, adding Sin­ga­pore must work hard to en­sure that mer­i­toc­racy does not de­velop into struc­tural in­equal­ity.</p>
    <p>“Many of the young in other de­vel­oped coun­tries see the dreams of their par­ents slip­ping be­yond their grasp and are re­act­ing against a sys­tem which they might feel is no longer ca­pa­ble of giv­ing them hope. We can­not let this hap­pen to us.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tong urged Sin­ga­pore’s youth not to stop dream­ing and never to lose their sense of op­ti­mism.</p>
    <p>“This is not a ‘lost gen­er­a­tion’, de­spite what some have said. This, in fact, is a gen­er­a­tion of op­por­tu­nity,” he said, as­sur­ing them that the Govern­ment will work with them to re­alise their dreams.</p>
    <p>“One day, you can tell your own kids of how mum and dad over­came the cri­sis of a gen­er­a­tion. You can tell them how you united with fel­low Sin­ga­pore­ans to leave be­hind a more beau­ti­ful and tightly knit­ted ta­pes­try.”</p>
