    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has rad­i­cally dis­rupted work en­vi­ron­ments around the world.</p>
    <p>Work from home has prompted cor­po­rate oc­cu­piers to seek more flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments, and tech­nol­ogy is en­abling com­pa­nies to al­low re­mote work­ing.</p>
    <p>This is likely to re­sult in com­pa­nies chang­ing their size needs, by re­quir­ing less space.</p>
    <p>But so­cial dis­tanc­ing re­quire­ments have re­sulted in a de­crease in of­fice den­sity, so more space is needed to ac­com­mo­date the same num­ber of work­ers.</p>
    <p>We be­lieve that in the short term, the preva­lence of work­ing from home will re­duce the im­me­di­ate need for ex­pan­sion space by firms and, over time, we be­lieve that or­gan­i­sa­tions will re­quire less space in the long term.</p>
    <p>If nu­mer­ous com­pa­nies opt to save on real es­tate costs by al­low­ing more em­ploy­ees to work from home, this could lead to a drop in of­fice de­mand in the long run.</p>
    <p>We can look at what banks and tech­nol­ogy firms, which are huge oc­cu­piers of prime of­fice space across the globe, are do­ing.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the fi­nance and tech sec­tors oc­cupy more than half of Grade A Cen­tral Busi­ness Dis­trict (CBD) space.</p>
    <p>Ma­jor in­ter­na­tional banks have in­di­cated they will al­low a sig­nif­i­cant pro­por­tion of their em­ploy­ees to work from home.</p>
    <p>Bar­clays de­clared they would be re-eval­u­at­ing their space needs go­ing for­ward, with chief ex­ec­u­tive Jes Sta­ley not­ing that head­quar­ters built to ac­com­mo­date thou­sands of staff could be a “thing of the past”.</p>
    <p>Other chief ex­ec­u­tives have ex­pressed sim­i­lar views.</p>
    <p>Mor­gan Stan­ley CEO James Gor­man stated that the bank would have “much less real es­tate” in the fu­ture, while So­ci­ete Gen­erale CEO Fred­eric Oudea said that around 20 per cent of its staff would con­tinue re­mote work­ing even af­ter the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Stan­dard Char­tered chair­man Jose Vi­nals opined that there would not be a need to have 100 per cent of peo­ple in the of­fice 100 per cent of the time.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Chris­tian Sewing of Deutsche Bank noted that this pre­sented an op­por­tu­nity for the bank to re­alise sub­stan­tial sav­ings in real es­tate costs.</p>
    <p>Large tech firms have also been very sup­port­ive of long-term re­mote work­ing.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Twit­ter and Square have an­nounced that all of their em­ploy­ees would be able to work from home in­def­i­nitely.</p>
    <p>This shift in at­ti­tude was sur­pris­ing, as tech firms have long be­lieved that in-per­son in­ter­ac­tion was cru­cial in pro­mot­ing creativ­ity and gain­ing a com­pet­i­tive edge.</p>
    <p>Con­cerns by tech CEOs such as Face­book founder Mark Zucker­berg that re­mote work­ing would re­duce the pro­duc­tiv­ity of their soft­ware en­gi­neers have also been dis­pelled dur­ing the lock­down pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Mr Zucker­berg was im­pressed by the fo­cus main­tained by his staff, and un­veiled a plan for up to half of Face­book’s 48,000 work­ers to telecom­mute per­ma­nently within the decade.</p>
    <p>The firm plans to ad­just wages based on em­ployee lo­ca­tion, with lower pay for those who re­side in more af­ford­able cities.</p>
    <p>There will also be sav­ings on the ser­vices pro­vided for on-cam­pus em­ploy­ees such as free cafe­te­rias, dry clean­ing and mas­sages.</p>
    <p>As we look to the fu­ture, we know the new work­place is no longer a sin­gle lo­ca­tion but an ecosys­tem of a va­ri­ety of lo­ca­tions and ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>This will have sig­nif­i­cant im­pli­ca­tions for Sin­ga­pore’s Grade A CBD of­fice mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Ma­rina Bay has long been re­garded as the pre­mium sub-mar­ket, with a huge pro­por­tion of its tenants be­ing fi­nance and tech firms.</p>
    <p>Should these firms go ahead with their long-term re­mote work­ing plans, the rental dif­fer­en­tial be­tween Ma­rina Bay and the other sub-mar­kets is ex­pected to nar­row.</p>
    <p>Even if of­fice de­mand re­mains muted in the long run, the Govern­ment has al­ready stated its in­ten­tion to fo­cus on its de­cen­tral­i­sa­tion ini­tia­tive and tighten fu­ture sup­ply in the CBD, which will aid in mit­i­gat­ing any re­duc­tion in de­mand.</p>
    <p>Cor­po­rates may now se­ri­ously look to de­cen­tralised lo­ca­tions with Grade A specs as ei­ther an al­ter­na­tive to the CBD or split oper­a­tions.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to the Covid-19 pan­demic, Cush­man & Wake­field in­tro­duced the Ex­pe­ri­ence per Square Foot data­base, which en­ables busi­nesses to un­der­stand how their em­ploy­ees are cop­ing with work­from-home con­di­tions and what they most need to re­main healthy, happy and en­gaged.</p>
    <p>To date, we have an­a­lysed more than 2.5 mil­lion data points driv­ing work­place ex­pe­ri­ence from work­ers all over the globe in the preCovid-19 era and a fur­ther 1.7 mil­lion data points from more than 50,000 re­spon­dents world­wide in the re­cent work-from-home en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>THE NEW OF­FICE</p>
    <p>Cush­man & Wake­field has pi­o­neered a so­cial dis­tanc­ing of­fice con­cept in Am­s­ter­dam and Syd­ney that out­lines strate­gies and tac­tics to min­imise the like­li­hood of virus spread­ing in the work­place, known as the 6 Feet Of­fice.</p>
    <p>This is a first-to-mar­ket con­cept to up­hold so­cial dis­tanc­ing, re­duce over­all touch points and pro­mote one-way cir­cu­la­tion and per­sonal hy­giene. The key el­e­ments of this con­cept are:</p>
    <p>• 6 Feet Quick Scan: A con­cise but thor­ough anal­y­sis of the cur­rent work­ing en­vi­ron­ment and other op­por­tu­ni­ties for im­prove­ment. • 6 Feet Rules: A set of sim­ple and clear rules of con­duct that put the safety of every­one first.</p>
    <p>• 6 Feet Rout­ing: A vis­ually dis­played and unique rout­ing for each of­fice, mak­ing traf­fic flows safe.</p>
    <p>• 6 Feet Work­sta­tion: An adapted and fully equipped work­place at which the user can work safely. • 6 Feet Fa­cil­ity: A trained em­ployee who ad­vises on and en­sures an op­ti­mally func­tion­ing and safe fa­cil­ity en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>• 6 Feet Cer­tifi­cate: A cer­tifi­cate stat­ing that mea­sures have been taken to im­ple­ment a virus-safe work­ing en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>The con­cept of main­tain­ing a safe dis­tance of six feet (1.8m) be­tween in­di­vid­u­als starts at the en­trance to the build­ing.</p>
    <p>In­di­cat­ing the de­sir­able dis­tances near the re­cep­tion desk and by the lifts is easy if you use vis­ual el­e­ments such as floor stick­ers.</p>
    <p>Floor mark­ings can also help to di­rect em­ploy­ees’ move­ments around the build­ing, its cor­ri­dors and floors – by in­di­cat­ing the sixfeet dis­tance and the pre­ferred one-way traf­fic in the clock­wise direc­tion.</p>
    <p>In con­fer­ence rooms, seats for meet­ing par­tic­i­pants will be placed at ad­e­quate dis­tances, and ar­rivals and de­par­tures will fol­low rules.</p>
    <p>Each work­sta­tion has to be sani­tised, so each em­ployee should have sani­tiser on hand to clean their work­sta­tions at the start and end of their work­ing hours.</p>
    <p>For shared work­sta­tions, it is pos­si­ble to im­prove san­i­ta­tion us­ing one-off desk­top pa­per pads that em­ploy­ees sim­ply throw away once they have com­pleted their work.</p>
    <p>RE­TURN OF CU­BI­CLES</p>
    <p>Open of­fices could be­come a thing of the past as the very na­ture of their open and dense design also in­creases the ease of trans­mis­sion of in­fec­tious dis­eases.</p>
    <p>A re­turn to the days of cu­bi­cles will pro­vide phys­i­cal sep­a­ra­tion be­tween work­ers and re­duce the cir­cu­la­tion of air­borne droplets.</p>
    <p>Firms that want to main­tain a “semi-open” look may opt to re­place cu­bi­cle walls with plexi-glass di­viders.</p>
    <p>IN­CREASE IN SIZE AND NUM­BER OF MEET­ING ROOMS</p>
    <p>With the need for par­tic­i­pants in a meet­ing to be seated apart, ex­ist­ing small meet­ing rooms will need to be en­larged.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of meet­ing rooms will also need to be in­creased as group con­ver­sa­tions which used to take place at the aisle, em­ploy­ees’ desks, pantry and other com­mon ar­eas should be shifted to meet­ing rooms to ad­here to so­cial dis­tanc­ing re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>EVO­LU­TION OF CO-WORK­ING</p>
    <p>Hot-de­sk­ing should be re­placed by as­signed seat­ing to re­duce the spread of in­fec­tious dis­eases should a co-work­ing mem­ber fall ill.</p>
    <p>Large open ar­eas for mem­bers to so­cialise could be­come a thing of the past. These open ar­eas can be con­verted into pri­vate of­fices.</p>
    <p>Firms can use co-work­ing spa­ces as part of their busi­ness con­tin­gency plan by plac­ing a back-up team in these pri­vate of­fices.</p>
    <p>In the event of an out­break in the firm’s own of­fice space, the backup team will be able to re­place the main team.</p>
