    <p>There were 42 new coro­n­avirus cases an­nounced by the Health Min­istry yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 55,395.</p>
    <p>This was the low­est daily to­tal in more t han four months since March 30, when 35 new in­fec­tions were re­ported.</p>
    <p>But 800 mi­grant work­ers had been newly quar­an­tined be­cause the min­istry dis­cov­ered a case among them in a dor­mi­tory cleared of the virus. They are among about 22,800 work­ers who are still serv­ing out their quar­an­tine pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said these work­ers will be tested when their quar­an­tine ends, and it ex­pects the new in­fec­tion case counts to re­main high in the com­ing days be­fore ta­per­ing off.</p>
    <p>Like the new cases, the num­ber of Covid-19 pa­tients in hos­pi­tals also hit dou­ble dig­its yes­ter­day, as 92 of them re­mained in hospi­tal. There were, how­ever, none in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>A sole pa­tient in the com­mu­nity was an­nounced yes­ter­day. He is a 58-year-old Sin­ga­porean who had been iden­ti­fied as a con­tact of a pre­vi­ously con­firmed case, and had been placed on quar­an­tine ear­lier. He was tested dur­ing quar­an­tine, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>There were also 11 i mported pa­tients, com­pris­ing two Sin­ga­pore­ans, three work pass hold­ers, one work per­mit holder, four de­pen­dant’s pass hold­ers and one spe­cial pass holder.</p>
    <p>Of the two Sin­ga­pore­ans – one re­turned from In­dia on July 3 and the other from In­done­sia on July 30.</p>
    <p>The pa­tient who re­turned from In­dia is an eight-year-old boy who had served his stay-home no­tice (SHN) with his par­ent and sib­lings in the same room at a ded­i­cated fa­cil­ity and was sub­se­quently placed on quar­an­tine again when his SHN con­tacts tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19. He had been tested again dur­ing quar­an­tine to ver­ify his sta­tus.</p>
    <p>The four de­pen­dant’s pass hold­ers ar­rived from In­dia on July 28 and 31. An­other four cases are work pass and work per­mit hold­ers em­ployed in Sin­ga­pore and they separately ar­rived from the Philip­pines on July 29 and from In­dia on July 31.</p>
    <p>All of them had been placed on 14-day SHN on ar­rival here and had been tested while serv­ing their notices or quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing im­ported pa­tient is a Filipino sea­man hold­ing a spe­cial pass who ar­rived from In­dia on Aug 8 on a ves­sel.</p>
    <p>He re­ported symp­toms and was swabbed while on the ves­sel, where he re­mained un­til his test re­sult came back pos­i­tive for Covid-19. He was taken to hospi­tal in an am­bu­lance.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Is Sa­lon in Bukit Ba­tok, War­ren Golf & Coun­try Club, HomeTeamNS Khatib, Chong Pang Wet Mar­ket & Food Cen­tre and North­point City were added to the list of places vis­ited by in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions and the times that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients have vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes to get those who were at these places at spe­cific pe­ri­ods to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>The full list of lo­ca­tions and times can be found on the min­istry’s web­site.</p>
    <p>The min­istry has said that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and that there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 30 new coro­n­avirus pa­tients an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of two cases a day in the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also stayed sta­ble at an av­er­age of one case a day over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 392 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 50,505 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 4,756 were re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>800 mi­grant work­ers had been newly quar­an­tined be­cause the Health Min­istry dis­cov­ered a case among them in a dor­mi­tory cleared of the virus. They are among about 22,800 work­ers who are still serv­ing out their quar­an­tine pe­riod.</p>
