    <p>HONG KONG • China’s move to stamp out on­line gam­bling to help con­tain cap­i­tal out­flows is hit­ting liq­uid­ity in Ma­cau’s VIP seg­ment, at a time when the world’s No. 1 gam­bling hub is hob­bled by slow­ing eco­nomic growth, Sino-US ten­sions and coro­n­avirus lock­downs.</p>
    <p>In June, Bei­jing iden­ti­fied the cross-bor­der flow of funds for gam­bling as a na­tional se­cu­rity risk.</p>
    <p>Since then, fi­nanc­ing chan­nels used by the on­line gam­bling sec­tor and cryp­tocur­rency lend­ing plat­forms have been cut off, with tens of thou­sands of sus­pects ar­rested.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have frozen thou­sands of bank ac­counts and seized more than 229 bil­lion yuan (S$45 bil­lion), ac­cord­ing to gov­ern­ment state­ments, while il­le­gal gam­bling rings across the coun­try have been purged on a near-weekly ba­sis.</p>
    <p>Casino ex­ec­u­tives and jun­ket op­er­a­tors in Ma­cau, a spe­cial ad­min­is­tra­tive re­gion where casino gam­bling is le­gal, say the crack­down is hit­ting big-spend­ing VIP cus­tomers due to wor­ries over their fi­nanc­ing chan­nels via the jun­kets.</p>
    <p>“It def­i­nitely im­pacts liq­uid­ity,” said Mr Lam Kai Kuong, di­rec­tor of the Ma­cau Jun­ket As­so­ci­a­tion, adding the VIP in­dus­try may never re­turn to rev­enue lev­els hit two years ago un­less China stops its sup­pres­sion of VIP gam­bling.</p>
    <p>Gam­bling is il­le­gal on the main­land and jun­kets op­er­ate in a grey area, lur­ing big spen­ders with lux­ury perks and lines of credit, of­ten us­ing un­der­ground bank­ing net­works and pay­ment chan­nels.</p>
    <p>The VIP jun­ket sec­tor in the former Por­tuguese colony ac­counts for al­most 50 per cent of over­all rev­enues, which hit US$36.5 bil­lion (S$50 bil­lion) last year.</p>
    <p>While many top jun­kets are not di­rectly in­volved in on­line gam­bling, agents un­der them use these chan­nels to set­tle debts and pro­vide credit for high rollers.</p>
    <p>“The jun­ket sec­tor in Ma­cau has been liv­ing on bor­rowed time for years, and the end is draw­ing nearer,” says Mr An­thony Lawrance, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of con­sul­tancy Greater Bay In­sight.</p>
    <p>“China clearly in­tends to cut out these mid­dle­men and gain better con­trol over the out­flows of ren­minbi through Ma­cau.”</p>
    <p>Ma­cau jun­ket ex­ec­u­tives said while China was not tar­get­ing the Ma­cau casino in­dus­try it­self, the fo­cus on money laun­der­ing and il­le­gal trans­ac­tions put pres­sure on liq­uid­ity. It prompted some spec­u­la­tion that Asia’s top j un­ket op­er­a­tor, Suncity, had been tar­geted by the au­thor­i­ties last month.</p>
    <p>The spec­u­la­tion saw around 900 play­ers with­draw de­posits from Suncity’s VIP clubs across casi­nos in Ma­cau be­tween July 9 and July 11, ac­cord­ing to an in­ter­nal e-mail sent among op­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>Ma­cau’s po­lice and gam­ing reg­u­la­tor was ad­vised of the with­drawals, the no­tice said, while pho­to­graphs on mes­sag­ing app WeChat showed dozens of i nvestors lin­ing up out­side Ma­cau’s lux­ury par­lours to with­draw cash amid fears it would be seized by the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the with­drawals, Suncity chair­man Alvin Chau spoke in rare de­tail about the com­pany’s fi­nan­cials in a seven-minute on­line video, deny­ing the com­pany had been tar­geted and say­ing it had enough cash to cover bad debts and de­posits for its cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Ma­cau’s gam­ing reg­u­la­tor told Reuters last week it was pay­ing close at­ten­tion to the mat­ter, al­though it had not seen any “ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties” con­cern­ing Suncity.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, in a no­tice to cus­tomers, AG Asia En­ter­tain­ment, which tar­gets Chi­nese gam­blers via on­line op­er­a­tions in the Philip­pines, said it was ceas­ing op­er­a­tions and asked them to with­draw de­posits be­fore Aug 12.</p>
    <p>The crack­down comes as casi­nos strug­gle with a dearth of trav­ellers due to coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>China has an­nounced the re­sump­tion of Ma­cau tourist visas for na­tion­als from Sept 23.</p>
    <p>Mr Ben Lee, founder of Ma­cau gam­ing con­sul­tancy IGamiX, said that even if there was demand from high rollers to go to Ma­cau, the abil­ity of the jun­kets to fi­nance gam­ing ac­tiv­ity re­mains se­verely con­strained.</p>
