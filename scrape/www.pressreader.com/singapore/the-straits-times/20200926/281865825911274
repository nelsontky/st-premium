    <p>PRIME MIN­IS­TER MUHYID­DIN YASSIN</p>
    <p>A one-time deputy prime min­is­ter un­der the Na­jib ad­min­is­tra­tion be­fore he was sacked for speak­ing out on the 1MDB scan­dal, Tan Sri Muhyid­din, 73, joined hands with Tun Dr Ma­hathir to oust BN in the 2018 na­tional polls.</p>
    <p>He held the pow­er­ful Home Min­is­ter port­fo­lio in Dr Ma­hathir ’s ad­min­is­tra­tion but was pro­pelled to the pre­mier­ship af­ter Dr Ma­hathir re­signed and the Pakatan Hara­pan gov­ern­ment col­lapsed in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>• How­ever, his hold on his seven-month-old Perikatan Na­sional gov­ern­ment – an al­liance of 13 par­ties – is ten­u­ous: he com­mands only</p>
    <p>113 MPs in the 222-strong Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>• Malaysia’s gen­eral elec­tion is not due un­til 2023, but Mr Muhyid­din has said he may hold a snap elec­tion sooner if his coali­tion wins the state polls to­day in Sabah, where he is cur­rently cam­paign­ing.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing Mr An­war ’s an­nounce­ment, Mr Muhyid­din has main­tained that he is still the le­git­i­mate leader, but his op­tions are in­creas­ingly run­ning out. He could ei­ther ad­vise the King to dis­solve Par­lia­ment to pave the way for a snap elec­tion, or Mr Muhyid­din could an­nounce that he has lost the ma­jor­ity and al­low Mr An­war to take over.</p>
    <p>OP­PO­SI­TION LEADER AN­WAR IBRAHIM</p>
    <p>• Al­ways the brides­maid, never the bride. Datuk Seri An­war, 73, has come tan­ta­lis­ingly close to the pre­mier­ship twice – in the 1990s when he was deputy prime min­is­ter be­fore he was fired and jailed for six years on charges of sodomy and abuse of power, and in 2018 when he waited pa­tiently for for­mer prime min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad to ful­fil a pledge to even­tu­ally name him prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>• On Wed­nes­day, he dropped a bomb­shell that he has a “strong, con­vinc­ing, for­mi­da­ble ma­jor­ity ” to form a new gov­ern­ment and that the gov­ern­ment of Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin has “col­lapsed”.</p>
    <p>• There is scep­ti­cism over</p>
    <p>Mr An­war ’s claims, es­pe­cially since he re­fused to state the num­ber of pledges he has from MPs and no lead­ers from across the aisle have openly pledged sup­port for him.</p>
    <p>• More­over, back in Septem­ber 2008, he claimed he had se­cured enough sup­port to top­ple the then Barisan Na­sional (BN) gov­ern­ment led by</p>
    <p>Tun Ab­dul­lah Badawi but the claim quickly fiz­zled out.</p>
