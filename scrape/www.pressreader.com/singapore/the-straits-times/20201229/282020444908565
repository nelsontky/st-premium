    <p>A group of teens are be­ing in­ves­ti­gated after they al­legedly played foos­ball us­ing live frogs.</p>
    <p>A video of the in­ci­dent, which sur­faced on­line over the week­end, shows the uniden­ti­fied teens un­box­ing about a dozen live frogs in a Burberry shoe box, with the words “Merry Christ­mas” splashed across the clip.</p>
    <p>It then cuts to a scene of the teens play­ing at a foos­ball ta­ble, hit­ting the ball around with a frog on the ta­ble try­ing to avoid be­ing hit.</p>
    <p>The words “Thanks for the 100 frogs” are splashed across a sec­ond clip.</p>
    <p>An­other scene shows the teens plac­ing the ball care­fully on the ta­ble, be­fore punt­ing it straight at one am­phib­ian, which is smacked onto the side of the foos­ball ta­ble be­fore hop­ping away.</p>
    <p>A third clip claimed to fea­ture the group’s “last frog”.</p>
    <p>Though no faces can be seen, the footage in­di­cates three youths, one of whom was film­ing, and a teenage girl were in­volved in the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Ms Jes­sica Kwok, group direc­tor for com­mu­nity an­i­mal man­age­ment at the An­i­mal and Vet­eri­nary Ser­vice (AVS), said it was con­cerned about the in­ci­dent and is in­ves­ti­gat­ing. “AVS takes all feed­back re­ceived from the pub­lic se­ri­ously and will look into the cases re­ported,” she said.</p>
    <p>In a me­dia state­ment, the So­ci­ety for the Preven­tion of Cru­elty to</p>
    <p>An­i­mals (SPCA) ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor Jaipal Singh Gill said that it has re­ceived a re­port on the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>The video de­picts a clear case of an­i­mal cru­elty that is pun­ish­able un­der the law, Mr Singh added.</p>
    <p>Any­one with in­for­ma­tion on the case, in­clud­ing the iden­ti­ties of the peo­ple in­volved, can e-mail the SPCA at in­spec­tor@spca.org.sg. Any in­for­ma­tion pro­vided will be treated in the strictest of con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>The videos have sparked ou­trage on­line, with many ne­ti­zens slam­ming the ac­tions of the young peo­ple and call­ing for tough ac­tion to be taken against them.</p>
    <p>It was also al­leged that one of the teenagers in the in­ci­dent is al­ready un­der po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tion for tres­pass­ing into the white rhino en­clo­sure at the Sin­ga­pore Zoo.</p>
    <p>In that in­ci­dent on Dec 17, the teen posted a video on TikTok show­ing him do­ing a back­flip in the en­clo­sure with the rhi­nos be­fore he leapt over the bar­ri­cade to return to the vis­i­tors’ foot­paths. At least four rhi­nos could be seen in the en­clo­sure at the time.</p>
    <p>Wildlife Re­serves Sin­ga­pore (WRS) had is­sued a state­ment con­demn­ing the youth’s ac­tions, call­ing it a “reck­less and mind­less act which is so­cially ir­re­spon­si­ble, ex­tremely dangerous and sim­ply dis­re­spect­ful to wildlife and an­i­mals”.</p>
    <p>WRS urged oth­ers not to pull such stunts as lives could be en­dan­gered.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with Chi­nese evening daily Lianhe Wan­bao, the youth said the in­ci­dent with the frogs oc­curred on Christ­mas Eve at a friend’s home where they had a small din­ner gath­er­ing. He said there were a to­tal of 17 frogs, which were meant to be fed to fishes.</p>
    <p>He claimed that all but one of the frogs were re­leased, and they wanted to feed that frog to the fishes but needed to dis­mem­ber it as it was too big.</p>
    <p>“We didn’t know how to kill the frog as quickly as pos­si­ble, and my friend thought that shoot­ing it with the ball might be ef­fec­tive, so we did that,” he said.</p>
    <p>“After that, we fed the frog to the fishes.”</p>
    <p>Post­ing a note on his In­sta­gram ac­count on Sun­day, the youth claimed that the group was not play­ing foos­ball with the frogs.</p>
    <p>“There was no in­ten­tion of an­i­mal cru­elty on my part,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>“I un­der­stand it’s easy to as­sume this, es­pe­cially be­cause of my re­cent rhino in­ci­dent, but peo­ple just as­sum­ing things does noth­ing but make them­selves look dumb when the real story comes out.”</p>
    <p>The videos have sparked ou­trage on­line, with many ne­ti­zens slam­ming the ac­tions of the young peo­ple and call­ing for tough ac­tion to be taken against them.</p>
