    <p>Malaysia’s Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin said yes­ter­day that the coun­try’s move­ment curbs have been ex­tended to Dec 31, as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic is not show­ing any signs of end­ing soon.</p>
    <p>In a na­tional tele­vised ad­dress, Tan Sri Muhyid­din said that the re­cent wor­ry­ing emer­gence of new clus­ters in sev­eral states and num­ber of cases also led him to ex­tend the recovery move­ment con­trol or­der (MCO).</p>
    <p>“Al­though we have han­dled the cri­sis well... in the in­ter­est of every­one, the gov­ern­ment has de­cided that the recovery MCO will be ex­tended to Dec 31, 2020,” he said.</p>
    <p>The ex­ten­sion will al­low the gov­ern­ment to quickly han­dle out­breaks un­der the Pre­ven­tion and Con­trol of In­fec­tious Dis­eases Act 1988, he said, while Malaysians will con­tinue to ad­here to health pro­to­cols set by the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Un­der the recovery MCO that be­gan on June 10, most busi­nesses have been al­lowed to reopen as long as they fol­low pro­to­cols such as record­ing the tem­per­a­tures of vis­i­tors to their premises and im­pos­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Night­clubs and pubs re­main shut un­der the recovery MCO, with the au­thor­i­ties say­ing it would be im­pos­si­ble to en­sure health pro­to­cols such as so­cial dis­tanc­ing at such out­lets.</p>
    <p>The move­ment re­stric­tions were orig­i­nally slated to end on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s bor­ders will also gen­er­ally re­main shut, with those fly­ing into Malaysia re­quired to un­dergo a manda­tory 14-day quar­an­tine to pre­vent the spread of im­ported cases.</p>
    <p>“Tourists are still not al­lowed to en­ter the coun­try to avoid im­ported cases,” the Malaysian PM said.</p>
    <p>Malaysia first im­posed the move­ment curbs on March 18, forc­ing schools and non-es­sen­tial busi­nesses to shut down. Peo­ple were con­fined to their homes ex­cept to buy food and es­sen­tial items, or to seek med­i­cal treat­ment.</p>
    <p>The strict stay-at-home rules bore fruit when daily cases be­gan ta­per­ing, which led to the gov­ern­ment start­ing the recovery MCO from June 10, grad­u­ally reopen­ing many busi­nesses and mass ac­tiv­i­ties such as pub­lic wor­ship and con­tact sports.</p>
    <p>Malaysia on Aug 1 made it com­pul­sory for every­one to wear face masks in crowded pub­lic places and on pub­lic trans­port, af­ter the au­thor­i­ties ob­served lower com­pli­ance of so­cial dis­tanc­ing when it en­tered the recovery phase of the curbs.</p>
    <p>“Due to face masks be­com­ing an es­sen­tial item in our ev­ery­day life, the Min­istry of Do­mes­tic Trade and Con­sumer Af­fairs is dis­cussing with man­u­fac­tur­ers to re­duce the price. If it’s fruit­ful, the price will be more af­ford­able and can ease our bur­den,” Mr Muhyid­din said in his speech.</p>
    <p>Malaysia yes­ter­day re­ported 10 new Covid-19 cases, bring­ing to­tal in­fec­tions to 9,306. The to­tal death toll caused by the virus re­mained at 125.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry has pro­posed rais­ing the fine by 10 times to RM10,000 (S$3,200), for those who break the Pre­ven­tion and Con­trol of In­fec­tious Dis­eases Act 1988 (Act 342).</p>
    <p>“I sup­port the rec­om­men­da­tion by the Health Min­istry to in­crease the fine for those who com­mit­ted an of­fence (un­der the Act), at least two or three times more than the amount now. But this needs to be stud­ied first be­fore the Act is amended,” Mr Muhyid­din said.</p>
    <p>The pro­posal by the min­istry came just days af­ter Cab­i­net min­is­ter Mohd Khairud­din Aman Razali breached the manda­tory quar­an­tine or­der fol­low­ing his re­turn from Turkey on July 7.</p>
    <p>In­stead of be­ing quar­an­tined for 14 days like other re­turnees from abroad, he was seen on his so­cial me­dia post­ings go­ing about at­tend­ing func­tions with oth­ers in­clud­ing meet­ing other min­is­ters.</p>
    <p>This sparked pub­lic anger as other Malaysians had been fined and even jailed, for vi­o­lat­ing the quar­an­tine.</p>
