    <p>Hin Leong Trad­ing, un­der ju­di­cial man­agers from Price­wa­ter­house­Coop­ers (PwC), has made an ap­pli­ca­tion to freeze as­sets, shares and funds held by its founder Lim Oon Kuin and his two chil­dren as ef­forts to re­coup US$3.5 bil­lion (S$4.61 bil­lion) of debt from the col­lapsed oil trader con­tinue.</p>
    <p>PwC is seek­ing to block the sale of any pri­vate prop­er­ties and re­moval of as­sets from Sin­ga­pore, among other mea­sures, court fil­ings show.</p>
    <p>The ap­pli­ca­tion was mo­ti­vated by a real risk of as­set dis­si­pa­tion, even as its ju­di­cial man­agers made progress with the sale of as­sets such as Uni­ver­sal Ter­mi­nal.</p>
    <p>More than 20 banks are fight­ing to re­cover bil­lions of dol­lars in loans to the trader af­ter wrong­way bets on Covid-19’s im­pact on oil prices un­furled hid­den losses and al­leged frauds.</p>
    <p>The fall­out is still re­ver­ber­at­ing across global mar­kets, prompt­ing fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to re­assess their ex­po­sure and shak­ing out large tracts of the of­ten opaque US$4 tril­lion oil trad­ing in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The ap­pli­ca­tion to the High Court of Sin­ga­pore was filed early last month. The court has re­quested the Lim fam­ily to file its re­sponse to the ap­pli­ca­tion by next Wed­nes­day, doc­u­ments show.</p>
    <p>The hear­ing is fixed for March 4. Hin Leong Trad­ing’s ju­di­cial man­agers de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>Calls and an e-mail to Davin­der Singh Cham­bers, which rep­re­sents Lim Oon Kuin, or O.K. Lim, went unan­swered. Sep­a­rately, no one re­sponded to an e-mail sent to the Lim fam­ily seek­ing com­ment.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily as­sets high­lighted by Hin Leong Trad­ing in­clude prop­er­ties, cash and in­vest­ments, in­sur­ance poli­cies, shares and club mem­ber­ships, ac­cord­ing to the fil­ings.</p>
    <p>Lim and his chil­dren may re­move any of the as­sets from Sin­ga­pore, or dis­pose of or deal with the as­sets, so long as the to­tal un­en­cum­bered value of his as­sets still in the coun­try re­mains no less than US$3.5 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, the Sin­ga­pore court re­ceived wind­ing-up ap­pli­ca­tions for sev­eral busi­nesses owned by the Lim fam­ily, ac­cord­ing to gov­ern­ment no­tices.</p>
    <p>An ap­pli­ca­tion to wind up Hin</p>
    <p>Leong Ma­rine In­ter­na­tional, a lu­bri­cant oil-blend­ing unit, was filed by Lim and his son Evan, a doc­u­ment showed.</p>
    <p>An­other ap­pli­ca­tion for the wind­ing up of eight ship­ping en­ti­ties un­der Xihe Hold­ings, also owned by the Lim fam­ily, was also seen.</p>
    <p>Hin Leong’s cred­i­tors are sched­uled to hold a meet­ing next Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Its ju­di­cial man­agers are set to pro­vide up­dates on the com­pany’s sta­tus and seek ap­proval for fees and costs, ac­cord­ing to an­other no­tice in the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment Gazette.</p>
