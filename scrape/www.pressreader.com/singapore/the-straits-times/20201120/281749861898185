    <p>Eight trav­ellers who ar­rived here this month are be­ing in­ves­ti­gated for mak­ing false stay-home no­tice dec­la­ra­tions, with four non-Sin­ga­pore­ans among them at risk of los­ing their per­ma­nent res­i­dency or long-term passes if found guilty of the of­fence.</p>
    <p>The Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Au­thor­ity (ICA) and po­lice said yesterday that four Sin­ga­pore­ans, two per­ma­nent res­i­dents and two long-term pass hold­ers who ar­rived from South Korea and Thai­land had made the false dec­la­ra­tions to avoid serv­ing their stayhome no­tices at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>This is the first time such an of­fence has been re­ported.</p>
    <p>Prior to their ar­rival here be­tween Nov 5 and Nov 12, the eight had ap­plied to serve the no­tices at their place of res­i­dence. In their ap­pli­ca­tions, they had de­clared they would be oc­cu­py­ing their place of res­i­dence alone, or only with house­hold mem­bers with the same travel his­tory and serv­ing stay-home no­tices of the same du­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, be­tween Nov 6 and 13, en­force­ment of­fi­cers con­ducted checks at their res­i­dences and found them with house­hold mem­bers who were not serv­ing stayhome no­tices. The eight trav­ellers were then taken to ded­i­cated stayhome no­tice fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The two PRs may have their sta­tuses re­voked or re-en­try per­mits can­celled or short­ened, while the two long-term pass hold­ers may have their passes can­celled or short­ened, the two agen­cies said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>They added that as a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure “to safe­guard pub­lic health”, house­hold mem­bers who were with the eight, but were not on stay-home no­tices, have been is­sued the no­tices as well.</p>
    <p>ICA has re­quired all trav­ellers serv­ing stay-home no­tices out­side of ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties to wear an elec­tronic mon­i­tor­ing de­vice through­out their no­tice pe­riod since Aug 11, which has al­lowed more trav­ellers to serve their no­tices at their place of res­i­dence, based on a risk-based ap­proach adopted by the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>ICA and the po­lice warned the pub­lic to take all dec­la­ra­tions re­lated to health, travel and stayhome no­tices se­ri­ously, adding that “firm en­force­ment ac­tion will be taken against those found to have made false dec­la­ra­tions”.</p>
    <p>Of­fend­ers have been jailed and fined for of­fences such as breach­ing stay-home no­tices or quar­an­tine or­ders, in­clud­ing a man who was sen­tenced to six weeks in jail af­ter he breached a stay-home no­tice and went out to eat bak kut teh on March 23.</p>
