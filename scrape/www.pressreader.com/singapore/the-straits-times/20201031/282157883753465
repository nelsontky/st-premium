    <p>While the world wres­tles with a deadly pan­demic and how to con­front cli­mate change, there’s an­other, long-term global chal­lenge that no one re­ally knows how to deal with: Pop­u­la­tion age­ing.</p>
    <p>As the hu­man race tran­si­tions from a bur­geon­ing, ex­plod­ing species to a static or shrink­ing one, economies around the world will come un­der sig­nif­i­cant strain.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan is the ca­nary in the coal mine here. Al­though its birth rate is not as low as that of many other rich coun­tries, it’s been low for a longer time.</p>
    <p>That’s why Ja­pan is now the world’s old­est ma­jor econ­omy: On the one hand, Ja­pan demon­strates why a shrink­ing pop­u­la­tion doesn’t au­to­mat­i­cally im­pov­er­ish a coun­try. Its pop­u­la­tion is slowly de­clin­ing and is back down to the level of two decades ago, yet the coun­try’s in­come per capita has con­tin­ued to rise as pro­duc­tiv­ity grows and more women en­ter the work­force.</p>
    <p>But pro­nounced age­ing like Ja­pan’s does come at an eco­nomic cost.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery year, a dwin­dling pool of work­ing-age Ja­panese peo­ple is forced to sup­port an ex­pand­ing pool of grey-haired con­sumers. This is why Ja­pan’s liv­ing standards are fall­ing be­hind rich coun­tries with grow­ing pop­u­la­tions: In con­crete terms, this means more adults forced into spend­ing hours do­ing elder­care, more taxes to pay for pen­sions and health­care, and lower liv­ing standards for the elderly.</p>
    <p>There’s also an­other po­ten­tial cost to se­vere age­ing: Macroe­co­nomic dys­func­tion.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to stan­dard macroe­co­nomic the­ory, ev­ery coun­try has a nat­u­ral rate of in­ter­est; when in­ter­est rates linger above this nat­u­ral level, a coun­try slips into de­fla­tion. Be­cause the nat­u­ral rate is tied to a coun­try’s fu­ture over­all growth rate, most the­o­ries agree that low pop­u­la­tion growth low­ers the nat­u­ral rate and makes it harder for cen­tral banks to ward off de­fla­tion.</p>
    <p>As Ja­pan’s pop­u­la­tion has lev­elled off, its econ­omy has slipped into a seem­ingly per­ma­nent state of de­fla­tion or near-de­fla­tion: In the early 2010’s af­ter Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe took of­fice, the Bank of Ja­pan made a heroic at­tempt to es­cape de­fla­tion, buy­ing up as­sets at a prodi­gious, un­prece­dented pace. And for a while it seemed to work, with in­fla­tion ris­ing al­most to the 2 per cent tar­get rate. But it soon fell down to near zero again.</p>
    <p>Now, thanks to the pan­demic, Ja­pan ap­pears to be slip­ping back into de­fla­tion.</p>
    <p>Some macroe­conomists be­lieve that per­sis­tent de­fla­tion threat­ens eco­nomic growth.</p>
    <p>It’s the­o­ret­i­cally pos­si­ble for a coun­try to ex­ist in a state of “sec­u­lar stag­na­tion”, in which prices can never rise and there’s al­ways a bit too much un­em­ploy­ment. Ja­pan doesn’t seem to be in this sit­u­a­tion yet; un­em­ploy­ment is still very low. But this may be com­ing at the ex­pense of pro­duc­tiv­ity, since more Ja­panese peo­ple are get­ting hired for low-pay­ing, ir­reg­u­lar jobs.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, fis­cal stim­u­lus, which econ­o­mists typ­i­cally of­fer as the rem­edy for sec­u­lar stag­na­tion, might be less ef­fec­tive in an age­ing so­ci­ety, as a re­cent In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund re­port ex­plains.</p>
    <p>Age­ing might also have an­other sub­tle cor­ro­sive ef­fect on pro­duc­tiv­ity. Es­pe­cially in coun­tries like Ja­pan that pro­mote peo­ple by se­nior­ity, a deficit of dy­namic, fresh-think­ing young peo­ple might make com­pa­nies less nim­ble and less open to new ideas.</p>
    <p>Pop­u­la­tion shrink­age also saps the power of eco­nomic ag­glom­er­a­tion, by mak­ing it harder to sus­tain a net­work of grow­ing, pro­duc­tive cities.</p>
    <p>Coun­tries can, and do, try to com­pen­sate for pop­u­la­tion age­ing. Old peo­ple work longer, and more par­ents go to work in­stead of stay­ing home with the chil­dren. Coun­tries also in­vest in au­to­ma­tion; it’s no ac­ci­dent that Ja­pan has pushed hard to be a leader in the field of ro­bot­ics.</p>
    <p>But un­less ro­bots get much bet­ter, there’s prob­a­bly a limit to how much th­ese mea­sures can fight the grey­ing tide.</p>
    <p>For now, the global pop­u­la­tion con­tin­ues to grow. That means that if coun­tries skew­ing older can over­come do­mes­tic po­lit­i­cal hur­dles, they can keep grow­ing by tak­ing in young work­ing-age im­mi­grants; that’s how Canada, the United States, Bri­tain and Ger­many have all grown faster than Ja­pan, and it’s why Ja­pan it­self has been ramp­ing up im­mi­gra­tion.</p>
    <p>But this so­lu­tion will be tem­po­rary, be­cause the tran­si­tion to small fam­i­lies is hap­pen­ing all over the world. Fer­til­ity in Mus­lim coun­tries, once be­lieved to be bas­tions of high birth rates for re­li­gious rea­sons, has crashed in the last two decades.</p>
    <p>Even sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa, the last bul­wark of high fer­til­ity, is see­ing its num­bers fall faster and faster. This doesn’t mean that the globe is headed for a child­less fu­ture, like the one de­picted in the movie Chil­dren Of Men, but it does mean that the win­dow is clos­ing for a few de­vel­oped coun­tries to con­tinue to meet the chal­lenges of pop­u­la­tion age­ing.</p>
    <p>So­ci­eties like Ja­pan are there­fore on the front lines of what will even­tu­ally be a global chal­lenge. The hu­man species has never be­fore dealt with pro­longed and con­tin­u­ous age­ing.</p>
    <p>Coun­tries need to con­tinue to ag­gres­sively search for so­lu­tions – es­pe­cially tech­no­log­i­cal fixes like au­to­ma­tion – in or­der to ease this un­prece­dented tran­si­tion.</p>
