    <p>Sin­ga­pore knew that fa­cil­i­tat­ing crew change for sea­far­ers stuck at sea could bring about risks such as im­port­ing Covid-19 cases, but it de­cided to go ahead any­way, to do the right thing as a mar­itime na­tion, said Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Trans­port and For­eign Af­fairs Chee Hong Tat yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic saw the sit­u­a­tion – in which hun­dreds of thou­sands of sea­far­ers were turned away by ports glob­ally in the past months – as a hu­man­i­tar­ian cri­sis that also com­pro­mised nav­i­ga­tional safety and threat­ened the flow of es­sen­tial goods.</p>
    <p>“We took the po­si­tion that we must start by do­ing the right thing, and then work with part­ners to do things right by putting in place the nec­es­sary risk mit­i­ga­tion mea­sures,” said Mr Chee.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment thus worked with in­dus­try play­ers and unions to im­ple­ment a pro­to­col to fa­cil­i­tate crew change. More than 57,000 crew mem­bers of dif­fer­ent na­tion­al­i­ties from over 3,500 ships have ben­e­fited from this since March, added Mr Chee.</p>
    <p>This stance to do the right thing is the first of three ar­eas in which the Repub­lic has dif­fer­en­ti­ated it­self amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, he told an au­di­ence of about 300 peo­ple at a vir­tual awards gala din­ner or­gan­ised by the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Cham­ber of Com­merce.</p>
    <p>This, along with stand­ing by tri­par­tite part­ners, is es­pe­cially im­por­tant in times of cri­sis, for oth­ers to re­tain trust in Sin­ga­pore, Mr Chee added.</p>
    <p>“It is dur­ing a cri­sis that we can see clearly who our true friends are and which coun­tries are re­li­able and can be counted upon.</p>
    <p>“Con­versely, it is also an op­por­tu­nity to know who the fair-weather friends are.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has also dif­fer­en­ti­ated it­self in its com­mit­ment to plan­ning long term and in­vest­ing for the fu­ture “when oth­ers pur­sue ini­tia­tives for short-term gain”, said Mr Chee.</p>
    <p>Third, even as “oth­ers turn in­wards and erect bar­ri­ers in re­sponse to pop­ulist pres­sures”, Sin­ga­pore’s goal is to stay open to tal­ent and stay con­nected to the world. This has cre­ated open­ness and di­ver­sity in the so­ci­ety, he said.</p>
    <p>“In­no­va­tion is most likely to hap­pen at the in­ter­sec­tion of dif­fer­ent ideas and per­spec­tives, when these come to­gether to cre­ate some­thing new,” said Mr Chee.</p>
    <p>He warned that the de­vel­op­ment of pop­ulist and xeno­pho­bic pol­i­tics would lead to com­pa­nies re­lo­cat­ing to other coun­tries, which would re­sult in more Sin­ga­pore­ans los­ing their jobs.</p>
    <p>Mr Chee also pre­sented awards to win­ners in four cat­e­gories yes­ter­day. A wine-pick­ing ro­bot at Changi’s DFS, which was the re­sult of a col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween Changi Air­port Group, Te­masek Polytech­nic and Soft­bank Tele­com Sin­ga­pore, was awarded the best tech­no­log­i­cal col­lab­o­ra­tion.</p>
