    <p>COM­PLE­MENTS DIG­I­TAL EF­FORTS</p>
    <p>The new seg­re­gated travel lane ar­range­ment for busi­ness meet­ings is likely to have only a small im­pact on Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy, ex­perts said, although it could be im­por­tant to in­creas­ing the coun­try’s rep­u­ta­tion as a safe place for busi­ness.</p>
    <p>This is all the more im­por­tant as Sin­ga­pore pre­pares to host the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum (WEF) in May next year, which was moved from Switzer­land when the WEF de­cided the Repub­lic was best placed to host the an­nual high­pro­file meet­ing.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try an­nounced a new scheme that will let for­eign busi­ness­men travel here to ded­i­cated build­ings equipped with fa­cil­i­ties to hold meet­ings with lo­cals, as well as with busi­ness­men from other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>It aims to al­low those from coun­tries of dif­fer­ent Covid-19 risk pro­files to meet in a con­trolled space, boost­ing Sin­ga­pore’s rep­u­ta­tion as a busi­ness hub and al­low­ing a ten­ta­tive re­sump­tion of face-to­face meet­ings.</p>
    <p>CIMB Pri­vate Bank­ing econ­o­mist Song Seng Wun said the scheme will be read as proof that Sin­ga­pore, although not the cheap­est place to host busi­ness meet­ings, can be the safest place for in­ter­na­tional meet­ings.</p>
    <p>He added that “ev­ery lit­tle ini­tia­tive to build con­fi­dence helps”, es­pe­cially when the $28 bil­lion tourism sec­tor, which in­cludes busi­ness travel, has been badly hurt.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lawrence Loh of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness School said it is also only pos­si­ble be­cause of Sin­ga­pore’s suc­cess in the past few months in con­trol­ling lo­cal trans­mis­sion of Covid-19. “This is one of the first steps we can take to pivot back to sit­u­a­tions where per­sonal in­ter­ac­tions are nec­es­sary,” he said.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses noted that face-to­face in­ter­ac­tions re­main ideal for build­ing trust and mak­ing in­vest­ment de­ci­sions. US avi­a­tion com­pany Kel­ley Aerospace, which re­cently opened its first base in Sele­tar, said the speed of key busi­ness in­for­ma­tion ex­change has been hin­dered by Covid-19 con­straints on cross-bor­der meet­ings.</p>
    <p>“Face-to-face meet­ings are still in­valu­able in fa­cil­i­tat­ing rapid in­for­ma­tion ex­change, ex­e­cut­ing change and cre­at­ing strong busi­ness part­ner­ships, es­pe­cially for the up­per man­age­ment,” a spokesman said. “We are ex­cited to ex­plore how we can utilise it to ramp our busi­ness speed back up.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lai Chang Wen, co-founder</p>
    <p>Face-to-face meet­ings and in­ter­ac­tions are es­sen­tial to build­ing strong and mean­ing­ful busi­ness re­la­tion­ships, es­pe­cially in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing this op­tion will com­ple­ment our cur­rent ef­forts that lever­age dig­i­tal tools and plat­forms to con­nect with our busi­ness part­ners across the re­gion.</p>
    <p>MR LAI CHANG WEN, co-founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of de­liv­ery firm Ninja Van.</p>
    <p>and chief ex­ec­u­tive of de­liv­ery firm Ninja Van, said: “Face-to-face meet­ings and in­ter­ac­tions are es­sen­tial to build­ing strong and mean­ing­ful busi­ness re­la­tion­ships, es­pe­cially in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing this op­tion will com­ple­ment our cur­rent ef­forts that lever­age dig­i­tal tools and plat­forms to con­nect with our busi­ness part­ners across the re­gion.”</p>
    <p>Re­cov­ery on a greater scale, how­ever, will have to await the es­tab­lish­ment of more sub­stan­tial air travel bub­bles that in­clude per­sonal and leisure travel, said in­de­pen­dent avi­a­tion an­a­lyst Bren­dan So­bie of So­bie Avi­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“The num­ber of pas­sen­gers gen­er­ated by the schemes for busi­ness trav­ellers, such as the re­cip­ro­cal green lanes, has so far not been that sig­nif­i­cant. Travel bub­bles open up a much big­ger seg­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Even then, the re­cov­ery would be rel­a­tively small-scale in the ini­tial phases. There will be no largescale re­cov­ery for at least sev­eral months.”</p>
