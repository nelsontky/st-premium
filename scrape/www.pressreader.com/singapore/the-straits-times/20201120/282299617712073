    <p>Phil Fo­den thanked Gareth South­gate for keep­ing faith in him af­ter the Eng­land mid­fielder made amends for “one of the hard­est mo­ments of his life” by scor­ing his first in­ter­na­tional goals in Wed­nes­day’s 4-0 win against Ice­land.</p>
    <p>Fo­den was sent home by South­gate along with Ma­son Green­wood af­ter the pair breached coro­n­avirus pro­to­cols by invit­ing local women into the team ho­tel during Eng­land’s trip to Ice­land in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>The 20-year-old was mak­ing his first Eng­land start since be­ing re­called and with the hosts lead­ing 2-0 in the Na­tions League dead rub­ber, the Manch­ester City mid­fielder grabbed a brace.</p>
    <p>“I am just happy to re­pay (South­gate) with the goals and play well,” Fo­den said af­ter be­com­ing the youngest Eng­land player to score more than once in a match at Wem­b­ley.</p>
    <p>“I was j ust de­ter­mined to get back and do the best I can.”</p>
    <p>Eng­land mid­fielder De­clan Rice, 21, also scored his first in­ter­na­tional goal in the Wem­b­ley rout.</p>
    <p>It was made all the sweeter com­ing along­side a goal for Ma­son Mount as Eng­land had three play­ers aged 21 or younger score in the same match for the first time since 1883.</p>
    <p>West Ham’s Rice and Chelsea’s Mount, 21, ful­filled a life­long dream as they played to­gether in Eng­land’s mid­field.</p>
    <p>“We have been best mates since we were eight years old. We have seen each other’s jour­neys and seen each other grow,” Rice said. “Be­fore the game, when we knew we were play­ing in mid­field to­gether, that was a spe­cial mo­ment, and then to score in the same game was in­cred­i­ble.”</p>
    <p>It has been a frus­trat­ing year for South­gate as Eng­land strug­gled to es­tab­lish any mo­men­tum on the pitch, while there was a rash of un­wanted head­lines pro­voked by sev­eral of his play­ers’ an­tics off it.</p>
    <p>He will hope his team’s last game of the year – which saw an­other eye-catch­ing dis­play from Jack Gre­al­ish – serves as the spring­board for a suc­cess­ful Euro­pean Cham­pi­onship cam­paign.</p>
    <p>“With Eng­land there is al­ways something to play for,” said South</p>
    <p>Eng­land have had three play­ers aged 21 or younger score in the same match for the first time since Fe­bru­ary 1883 v Ire­land (Wil­liam Cob­bold, Oliver Whate­ley and Frank Paw­son). gate, who em­ployed the 3-4-3 sys­tem for the seventh straight match.</p>
    <p>“There are big op­por­tu­ni­ties for young play­ers, es­pe­cially.”</p>
    <p>Else­where in Group 2, there was more at stake for Bel­gium, who beat Den­mark 4-2 to reach the fi­nal four of the com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>“We have proven now we can play dif­fi­cult games,” said striker Romelu Lukaku af­ter scor­ing twice in the win.</p>
    <p>“We can play teams off the park but we also know how to win when it’s needed even if it is not with our best style. When we need we can play with a strong de­fence and on the counter-at­tack.”</p>
    <p>Italy se­cured first place in Group 1 with a 2-0 win over Bos­nia and Herze­gov­ina in Sara­jevo, en­sur­ing they fin­ished a point ahead of the Nether­lands, who beat Poland 2-1 away.</p>
    <p>The Az­zurri and world’s topranked Bel­gium join Spain and World Cup hold­ers France in a knock­out tour­na­ment ex­pected to be held in Italy next Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Italy man­ager Roberto Mancini ad­mit­ted he now faces a se­lec­tion headache for the June-July Euro 2020 af­ter a young Ital­ian side proved solid de­spite in­jury and coro­n­avirus woes that led to the ab­sence of play­ers in­clud­ing Leonardo Bonucci, Gior­gio Chiellini, Marco Ver­ratti, Ciro Im­mo­bile and Fed­erico Chiesa.</p>
    <p>In­ter Mi­lan de­fender Alessan­dro Bas­toni, 21, was among those who im­pressed.</p>
    <p>“It was al­ready dif­fi­cult to choose, but af­ter these four to five months it will be even more.</p>
    <p>“Many play­ers have emerged and are prov­ing to be ex­cel­lent,” said Mancini.</p>
