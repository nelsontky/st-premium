    <p>WUHAN • China is re­cast­ing Wuhan as a heroic coron­avirus vic­tim and try­ing to throw doubt on the pan­demic’s ori­gin story as it aims to seize the nar­ra­tive at a time of grow­ing global dis­trust of Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic re­la­tions blitz plays out daily in com­ments by Chi­nese of­fi­cials and lav­ish state me­dia cov­er­age of a “re­born” Wuhan that trum­pets China’s epi­demic-con­trol ef­forts and eco­nomic re­cov­ery while the United States strug­gles.</p>
    <p>The drive peaked in the past week as Chi­nese pri­mary schools wel­comed back pupils with much fan­fare and Wuhan hosted ex­ec­u­tives from dozens of multi­na­tion­als, from Pana­sonic to Dow and Nokia, on a highly chore­ographed tour of the cen­tral Chi­nese city.</p>
    <p>“There are few places in the world to­day where you don’t need a mask and can gather,” a Chi­nese of­fi­cial, Mr Lin Song­tian, told the ex­ec­u­tives, im­ply­ing that Wuhan was one of those places. “This tes­ti­fies to Wuhan’s tri­umph over the virus and that (the city) is back in busi­ness.”</p>
    <p>Lost in this retelling, how­ever, is that a wet mar­ket in Wuhan is widely be­lieved to be ground zero for the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>China’s For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi sug­gested on Aug 28 dur­ing a Euro­pean out­reach trip that the virus might not have emerged in China.</p>
    <p>The drive in­di­cates China recog­nises Covid-19’s dam­age to its brand and wants to lever­age its rel­a­tively suc­cess­ful re­cov­ery to</p>
    <p>counter grow­ing in­ter­na­tional chal­lenges, an­a­lysts said.</p>
    <p>China faces for­eign bit­ter­ness over the virus and an ini­tial coverup at­tempt by Wuhan of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>“Bei­jing wants the nar­ra­tive to be: we han­dled it, we can help you han­dle it and (hope­fully) we’re the first to have a vac­cine that works,” said</p>
    <p>Ms Kelsey Brod­er­ick, Asia an­a­lyst with Eura­sia Group.</p>
    <p>The fum­bling US pan­demic re­sponse pro­vides a clear open­ing, said Ms Yun Jiang, di­rec­tor of Aus­tralian Na­tional Univer­sity’s China Pol­icy Cen­tre. “The fact that the US is not only not do­ing enough, but ac­tu­ally do­ing things that go against</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can in­ter­ests, is a big help to China,” she said.</p>
    <p>The city of 11 mil­lion – which suf­fered more than 80 per cent of China’s 4,634 Covid-19 deaths – has come a long way since the pan­demic’s grim early days, when a suf­fo­cat­ing weeks-long lock­down ren­dered it a ghost town.</p>
    <p>No new lo­cal trans­mis­sions have been re­ported in months, traf­fic jams are back, shop­pers cram malls, and al fresco din­ers gob­ble up the city’s sig­na­ture spicy cray­fish dish.</p>
    <p>Face masks sag from the neck or are aban­doned al­to­gether.</p>
    <p>But not ev­ery­one is tak­ing a vic­tory lap. Many Wuhan cit­i­zens ex</p>
    <p>press per­sis­tent con­cern over an un­even re­cov­ery and fear of new out­breaks. “Ev­ery­one is afraid the epi­demic will re­turn, you know? The sum­mer is over, and win­ter is com­ing,” said Ms Yi Xin­hua, 51. “We’ve re­cov­ered a bit. But if the virus comes back, we’ll be hit again.”</p>
