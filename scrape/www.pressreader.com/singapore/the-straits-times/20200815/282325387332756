    <p>• The LPGA Tour on Thurs­day can­celled the Tai­wan Swing­ing Skirts tour­na­ment be­cause of con­cerns and travel re­stric­tions ow­ing to the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The event – which Amer­i­can world No. 4 Nelly Korda has won for the past two years – had been sched­uled for Oct 29- Nov 1 at Mi­ram ar Golf Coun­try Club in Taipei, but the Tour said the de­ci­sion to call it off was based on the latest ad­vice from the Tai­wanese gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>A state­ment read: “While we are dis­ap­pointed we can­not play this year, both Swing­ing Skirts and the LPGA are fully com­mit­ted to re­turn­ing in 2021 for the Tai­wan Swing­ing Skirts LPGA.”</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment comes two days after the LPGA Tour can­celled its Shanghai tour­na­ment, after China said that it would not hold most in­ter­na­tional sports events for the rest of this year be­cause of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>With both events be­ing axed, this means there are only two re­main­ing Asian-based LPGA Tour events – the BMW Ladies Cham­pi­onship and the Toto Ja­pan Clas­sic – left on the re­vamped and con­densed sched­ule.</p>
    <p>Both are said to be doubt­ful and, if they are also scrapped, it would mean there will be no LPGA Tour events in Asia this year.</p>
    <p>In late Jan­uary and Fe­bru­ary, its Thai­land event, the Blue Bay tour­na­ment in China and the HSBC Women’s World Cham­pi­onship at Sen­tosa were all axed at the out­set of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Men and women’s pro­fes­sional golf has made a ten­ta­tive re­turn in the United States and Europe, but with no spec­ta­tors in at­ten­dance and strict virus-preven­tion pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>The LPGA Tour sea­son was shut down by the pan­demic in Fe­bru­ary after just four events, two in Florida and two in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>It restarted just two weeks ago with back-to-back events in Ohio, both won by Amer­i­can world No. 2 Danielle Kang.</p>
    <p>The cir­cuit is cur­rently based in Britain for the Scot­tish Open, which ends to­mor­row, ahead of the year’s first Ma­jor, the women’s Bri­tish Open, which is sched­uled to start next Thurs­day.</p>
