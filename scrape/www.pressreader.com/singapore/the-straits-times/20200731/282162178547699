    <p>Share­hold­ers of main­board-listed telco Sing­tel can be paid in shares in­stead of cash after a suc­cess­ful vote to in­clude a scrip div­i­dend scheme in the com­pany’s char­ter.</p>
    <p>The amend­ment was passed at an an­nual gen­eral meet­ing (AGM) yes­ter­day, even as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic hung over the group’s out­look in the months ahead.</p>
    <p>“Given the un­prece­dented dis­rup­tion from Covid-19, we have not pro­vided guid­ance on our out­look, capex and div­i­dend for the cur­rent fi­nan­cial year,” group chief ex­ec­u­tive Chua Sock Koong told share­hold­ers at the AGM, which was de­liv­ered over live we­b­cast.</p>
    <p>Sing­tel re­cently cut its pay­out for the fi­nan­cial year to March 31 to 12.25 cents a share, down from 17.5 cents the year be­fore.</p>
    <p>That is even as the telco ex­pects pro­vi­sions for bad debts to in­crease in line with an eco­nomic slow­down, ac­cord­ing to a bourse fil­ing aimed at ad­dress­ing com­mon share­holder ques­tions.</p>
    <p>On how the Covid-19 pan­demic has af­fected cus­tomers’ abil­ity to pay their bills on time, Sing­tel noted that pre­paid mo­bile use has de­clined, while post­paid sales and col­lec­tion are slower. But re­gional as­so­ci­ates are pro­mot­ing the use of on­line chan­nels to col­lect top-ups and bill pay­ments, while eco­nomic re­cov­ery in re­gional mar­kets of­fers up­lift, the group said.</p>
    <p>“The full im­pact of the pan­demic will only be­come clearer as the eco­nomic con­se­quences un­fold. Mean­while, our as­so­ci­ates are push­ing ahead with their dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion to nav­i­gate the un­cer­tain­ties and po­si­tion them­selves for a dig­i­tal-led re­cov­ery.”</p>
    <p>The com­pany also re­as­sured in­vestors that its net­work and op­er­a­tions re­main re­silient, de­spite ear­lier work­force and sup­ply-chain dis­rup­tions from the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, hand­set ship­ments to Sin­ga­pore have re­cov­ered from de­lays at the start of the out­break, while re­sources in Sin­ga­pore and Aus­tralia have helped to ease a labour crunch when lock­downs in Malaysia, In­dia and the Philip­pines af­fected off­shore ser­vice cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Sing­tel also re­it­er­ated its stance on fi­nan­cial pru­dence at the AGM, cit­ing both Covid-19-re­lated un­cer­tain­ties, and the need to in­vest in 5G wire­less tech­nol­ogy, which it billed “a multi-year in­vest­ment pro­gramme for long-term growth”.</p>
    <p>The com­pany also re­cently clinched a li­cence to build and run a na­tion­wide 5G net­work in Sin­ga­pore, with the roll­out ex­pected to be­gin from next year.</p>
    <p>While the telco does not ex­pect 5G to be a key driver of re­turns in the near term, it still an­tic­i­pates new rev­enue op­por­tu­ni­ties in the longer run from con­sumer ap­pli­ca­tions such as cloud gam­ing, and en­ter­prise ap­pli­ca­tions such as edge com­put­ing.</p>
    <p>“We ex­pect that the in­dus­try will see more ra­tio­nal pric­ing de­ci­sions to en­able ac­cept­able re­turns and con­tin­ued net­work in­vest­ments,” it said of the Sin­ga­pore mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, key Sing­tel as­so­ciate Bharti Air­tel has posted a loss of 151.9 bil­lion rupees (S$2.79 bil­lion) for the three months to June 30, on the back of ex­cep­tional items such as ad­justed tax charges and pro­vi­sions for net­work-re­lated fees owed to the In­dian govern­ment.</p>
    <p>In all, In­dia-based Air­tel clocked 155 bil­lion rupees in ex­cep­tional charges for the quar­ter, after taxes and mi­nor­ity in­ter­ests, with Sing­tel’s eq­uity share of this com­ing to $911 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Sing­tel will dis­close its share of its re­gional as­so­ci­ates’ re­sults – in­clud­ing Air­tel’s – next month, the group added in a bourse up­date on Wednes­day.</p>
