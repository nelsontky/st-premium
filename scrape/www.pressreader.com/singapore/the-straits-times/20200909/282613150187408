    <p>You must have been crushed when the Cir­cuit Breaker mea­sures made it hard for you to view your dream prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>But Phase 2 means that you can go back to view­ing your dream prop­er­ties again.But the fol­low­ing safe man­age­ment mea­sures must be fol­lowed to min­imise the risk of COVID-19 trans­mis­sion:</p>
    <p>• View­ings are by ap­point­ment only with fixed time slots; no open house or walk-ins are al­lowed • Ev­ery­one must log their en­trance and exit tim­ings to the show gallery they visit to fa­cil­i­tate con­tact trac­ing • Each show gallery and within show units must have a max­i­mum ca­pac­ity based on a min­i­mum of 10 sqm per per­son</p>
    <p>• Group view­ings are lim­ited to a max­i­mum of five per­sons, in­clud­ing sales­per­sons and prospec­tive buy­ers</p>
    <p>• A min­i­mum of 1m dis­tance must be main­tained be­tween in­di­vid­u­als</p>
    <p>• Per­sons who are un­well must not at­tend. The sales­per­sons may ask clients who ap­pear un­well to leave and go home/see a doc­tor</p>
    <p>• No min­gling or mix­ing of groups are al­lowed</p>
    <p>• All per­sons must wear masks. Chil­dren 12 years or below and per­sons who have health con­di­tions that may re­sult in breath­ing or other dif­fi­cul­ties when a mask is worn for a pro­longed pe­riod of time, may use face shields in­stead</p>
    <p>• All at­ten­dees are en­cour­aged to sani­tise their hands us­ing hand sani­tis­ers</p>
    <p>• Ap­pro­pri­ate mea­sures must be taken to re­duce con­tact with sur­faces</p>
    <p>• Reg­u­lar clean­ing and sani­tis­ing of high-touch ar­eas, such as kitchen counter tops, must take place</p>
    <p>• No ma­te­ri­als must be taken or given out. Fly­ers, doc­u­ments and brochures should be de­liv­ered via elec­tronic means to clients</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar mea­sures are also in place for view­ing com­pleted prop­er­ties. Take note of the fol­low­ing points:</p>
    <p>• View­ing is by ap­point­ment only.</p>
    <p>• Start and end times must be clearly stated and ad­hered to</p>
    <p>• Du­ra­tion of view­ing should be as shortas pos­si­ble</p>
    <p>• Per­sons from dif­fer­ent house­holds must main­tain 1m safe dis­tance at all times</p>
    <p>• Per­sons who are un­well must not at­tend• All at­ten­dees are en­cour­aged to sani­tise their hands us­ing hand sani­tis­ers</p>
    <p>• View­ing records must be kept, man­u­ally or dig­i­tally. The seller’s agent may reg­is­ter a SafeEn­try QR code for the prop­erty prior to any view­ing and re­quire all visi­tors to sign in/out</p>
    <p>• If no seller’s agent is in­volved, the buyer’s agent can reg­is­ter for a SafeEn­try QR code be­fore the view­ing</p>
    <p>• Back-to-back view­ings are not al­lowed. There should be a time gap be­tween ap­point­ments to pre­vent gath­er­ings or phys­i­cal in­ter­ac­tions be­tween groups of view­ers/other peo­ple.</p>
