    <p>LACEY, WASH­ING­TON • Law en­force­ment agents shot and killed an An­tifa sup­porter as they moved to ar­rest him in the fa­tal shoot­ing of a right-wing ac­tivist who was part of a pro-Trump car­a­van in Port­land, Ore­gon, of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>The sus­pect, Michael For­est Rei­noehl, 48, was shot by of­fi­cers from a fed­er­ally led fugi­tive task force on Thurs­day dur­ing the en­counter in Lacey, Wash­ing­ton, south-west of Seat­tle, ac­cord­ing to four law en­force­ment of­fi­cials fa­mil­iar with the in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>Lieu­tenant Ray Brady of the Thurston County Sher­iff’s Of­fice said in an in­ter­view that the sus­pect be­ing sought by the law en­force­ment team had ex­ited an apart­ment and got into a ve­hi­cle. “As they at­tempted to ap­pre­hend him, there was gun­fire,” he said.</p>
    <p>He said four law en­force­ment of­fi­cers fired their weapons. Lt Brady added that of­fi­cers at the scene re­ported that the sus­pect was armed but that in­ves­ti­ga­tors had not con­firmed that as of early yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the shoot­ing, sev­eral hun­dred pro­test­ers in Port­land gath­ered in front of a po­lice sta­tion in a res­i­den­tial neigh­bour­hood, chant­ing racial jus­tice slo­gans as they have on most nights since May, al­though the mood shortly be­fore mid­night was rel­a­tively calm.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, New York Gover­nor An­drew Cuomo on Thurs­day called for “ex­pe­di­tious” an­swers from an in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the death of Mr Daniel Prude, a black man, af­ter Rochester po­lice put a hood over his head and as­phyx­i­ated him while ar­rest­ing him in March.</p>
    <p>Mr Prude’s fam­ily re­leased on Wed­nes­day body cam­era footage from his ar­rest in March, show­ing a group of of­fi­cers putting a hood over his head as he knelt on the ground, hand­cuffed and naked, apparently to pre­vent his spit from trans­mit­ting the novel coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>“For the sake of Mr Prude’s fam­ily and the greater Rochester com­mu­nity, I am call­ing for this case to be con­cluded as ex­pe­di­tiously as pos­si­ble. For that to oc­cur, we need the full and timely co­op­er­a­tion of the Rochester Po­lice Depart­ment and I trust it will fully com­ply,” Mr Cuomo said.</p>
    <p>Mr Prude’s fam­ily has called for the ar­rest of the of­fi­cers in­volved in his death, which came seven days af­ter the in­ci­dent. Mr Prude was 41.</p>
    <p>The Monroe County med­i­cal ex­am­iner ruled Mr Prude’s death a homi­cide caused by “com­pli­ca­tions of as­phyxia in the set­ting of phys­i­cal re­straint”, ac­cord­ing to an au­topsy re­port, the New York Times re­ported.</p>
