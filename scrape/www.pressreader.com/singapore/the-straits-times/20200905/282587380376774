    <p>TORONTO • Amer­ica’s top ath­letes could be banned from the Olympic Games and other ma­jor in­ter­na­tional sport­ing events if the United States fol­lows through on its threat to with­draw fund­ing from the World Anti-Dop­ing Agency (Wada), anti-dop­ing lead­ers told Reuters.</p>
    <p>The threat has sent shock­waves through the anti-dop­ing com­mu­nity and prompted sev­eral gov­ern­ments to urge Wada to in­tro­duce leg­is­la­tion that would find the US non-com­pli­ant with the Wada Code, ef­fec­tively bar­ring Amer­i­can ath­letes from in­ter­na­tional com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>“We have been ap­proached by a num­ber of gov­ern­ments of the world that were shocked by the threats from the US gov­ern­ment sup­ported by Usada (United States Anti-Dop­ing Agency),” Wada chief Wi­told Banka told Reuters.</p>
    <p>“These gov­ern­ments want us to con­sider an amend­ment to the com­pli­ance stan­dard, mean­ing that non-pay­ment by a gov­ern­ment of its Wada con­tri­bu­tion could lead di­rectly to that coun­try’s Nado (Na­tional Anti-Dop­ing Or­gan­i­sa­tion) be­ing de­clared non-com­pli­ant with the World Anti-Dop­ing Code.”</p>
    <p>Wada’s ex­ec­u­tive committee could dis­cuss the re­quests for the rule amend­ment this month, when of­fi­cials meet on Sept 14 and 15. But any for­mal de­ci­sion would also need to be con­sid­ered by Wada’s com­pli­ance re­view committee.</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional Olympic Committee (IOC) rules stip­u­late there needs to be Wada com­pli­ance to al­low Games par­tic­i­pa­tion.</p>
    <p>Usada pres­i­dent Travis Ty­gart fired back by la­belling the Wada threat empty and il­le­gal.</p>
    <p>“To threaten one coun­try’s ath­letes over Wada’s failed gover­nance model is pretty re­mark­able and dis­ap­point­ing,” he told Reuters.</p>
    <p>“They ought to spend the time try­ing to fix and make Wada what the world wants it to be, which is a strong, in­de­pen­dent Wada.”</p>
    <p>A re­port by the White House’s Of­fice of Na­tional Drug Con­trol Pol­icy (ONDCP), pre­sented to the US Congress in June, was highly crit­i­cal of Wada, de­mand­ing that it im­ple­ment im­me­di­ate re­forms.</p>
    <p>The US is the largest sin­gle con­trib­u­tor to Wada, pay­ing over US$2.7 mil­lion (S$3.6 mil­lion) into the 2020 bud­get of US$37.4 mil­lion. Half of Wada’s fund­ing comes from the IOC.</p>
    <p>Even with­out an amend­ment to Wada’s rules, an un­prece­dented move to cut fund­ing could trig­ger a messy non-com­pli­ance is­sue and leave Amer­i­can ath­letes in limbo.</p>
    <p>Those aim­ing to qual­ify for ma­jor com­pe­ti­tions would have prob­lems be­cause, even if they were not di­rectly sanc­tioned by Usada’s com­pli­ance sta­tus, they could have dif­fi­culty demon­strat­ing a clean record.</p>
