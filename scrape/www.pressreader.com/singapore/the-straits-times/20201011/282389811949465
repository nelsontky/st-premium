    <p>From ev­ery place I have lived, I have ben­e­fited. In ev­ery place I have lived, I have hoped to be­long. More than just be­ing a reg­u­lar tax­payer, a good em­ployee or con­sid­er­ate neigh­bour, I have tried to add value.</p>
    <p>When it was time to re­new my pass­port, I placed old pass­ports side by side.</p>
    <p>An­no­tated with colour­ful visa stamps from thirty-odd coun­tries, the pan­els formed a travel-themed trip­tych, a work­ing map of the places I have been in the 30 years since my first flight away from In­dia, my first home.</p>
    <p>The names of my de­ceased par­ents ap­pear in each ver­sion. Stamps of some coun­tries ap­pear on mul­ti­ple pages; oth­ers, just once. Who are the peo­ple and what are the places that left more than just an im­pres­sion on me? What is my legacy from these trav­els?</p>
    <p>My pass­ports pro­vide a clue. They don’t tell the full story.</p>
    <p>One sunny win­ter morn­ing, I stepped into a 7-Eleven store in down­town Bal­ti­more to ask for di­rec­tions to the Univer­sity of Mary­land School of Phar­macy. I had mar­velled at the sparsely pop­u­lated com­part­ments on the com­muter train I had boarded from my home in a suburb of Wash­ing­ton, DC, so dif­fer­ent from the crowded trains back in Mum­bai.</p>
    <p>Un­aware of how strange I must have looked in my beige cot­ton sal­war kameez and prom­i­nent red bindi on my fore­head, I no­ticed how ev­ery­thing was dif­fer­ent in the United States – the peo­ple, their ac­cent and even the side of the road they drove on.</p>
    <p>On that first day at univer­sity, I could not have known that “home” would be phys­i­cally lo­cated in three coun­tries over the next three decades. That my three sub­se­quent pass­ports would be re­newed in three con­sulates. That work would lead to sat­is­fac­tion and growth, but also de­mand sac­ri­fice and ad­just­ments. That life would be a process of con­stant ne­go­ti­a­tion with what was pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“Life can only be un­der­stood back­wards; but it must be lived for­wards,” wrote Dan­ish philoso­pher Soren Kierkegaar­d.</p>
    <p>As a wide-eyed, fear­less stu­dent in the US, I had brought with me a strong aca­demic foun­da­tion from my early ed­u­ca­tion in In­dia along with a re­solve to work hard. In five years, I ac­quired a PhD and learnt to com­mu­ni­cate clearly and con­cisely.</p>
    <p>At my first work­place in Cal­i­for­nia, as part of a di­verse, dy­namic and driven work­force, I thrived in ma­trix struc­tures that were fo­cused on pro­duc­tiv­ity, not hi­er­ar­chy, and de­liv­ered within tight time­lines.</p>
    <p>I came to ap­pre­ci­ate my boss, a for­mer con­struc­tion worker who had earned a col­lege ed­u­ca­tion late in life, and col­leagues who man­aged to squeeze in time for a game of ten­nis af­ter a long day at the of­fice.</p>
    <p>Re­turn­ing to In­dia in the new mil­len­nium, I found a vast dif­fer­ence in the ethos of my coun­try­men and women. I looked like ev­ery­one else, but did not feel like I be­longed. My global out­look was at odds with their cul­tural mind­set. Over time, I came to</p>
    <p>ad­mire their abil­ity to get work done de­spite traf­fic woes, elec­tric­ity short­ages and fam­ily de­mands. I learnt to be flex­i­ble, fo­cused and cre­ative, the cor­ner­stones of “ju­gaad” – the abil­ity to solve a prob­lem in an in­no­va­tive way, us­ing lim­ited re­sources.</p>
    <p>When I ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore, I brought not just the de­gree and job ti­tles listed on my re­sume, but also the parts of me that had been shaped by all the peo­ple I had met and worked with. Not all of it was vis­i­ble. Not much could be doc­u­mented.</p>
    <p>On job ap­pli­ca­tions, there was no place to in­di­cate my abil­ity to func­tion in­de­pen­dently but co­op­er­a­tively in mul­ti­cul­tural teams, a skill I ac­quired in my</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can work­life. There was no check­box to high­light my ease with am­bi­gu­ity, an in­her­ent cul­tural trait that had resur­faced dur­ing my stint in In­dia.</p>
    <p>In the last three decades, I have spent 20 years of my adult life in coun­tries where I have been la­belled as a for­eigner, and a decade in In­dia where I was la­belled “for­eign-re­turned”.</p>
    <p>At one of my ear­li­est job in­ter­views as a freshly minted PhD at a phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal start-up in the US, I was po­litely shown the door in the first few min­utes for lack­ing an au­tho­rised work visa. I cried on the way home, feel­ing in­ad­e­quate, an­gry and un­sure about the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Shortly af­ter that un­happy day, I was asked to join a high-pro­file col­lab­o­ra­tive project which then led to a job at a top multi­na­tional com­pany in Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>Years later, when I left the highly cov­eted job to re­turn to In­dia, a thought­ful col­league wrote “Amer­ica’s loss is In­dia’s gain” in my farewell card.</p>
    <p>At a re­cent col­lo­quium or­gan­ised by the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity, guest speaker and well-known travel writer Pico Iyer said: “It’s im­pos­si­ble to have glob­al­ism with­out the lo­cal com­po­nent. And it’s dan­ger­ous to have lo­cal­ism with­out global vi­sion.” Iyer finds “great lib­er­a­tion” in not be­long­ing to any one tribe, pre­fer­ring in­stead to be known for his pas­sions than for his pass­port. I agree.</p>
    <p>My pass­port in­di­cates my na­tion­al­ity. The visa stamps doc­u­ment my trav­els. But with each new place that I call home, it is be­com­ing in­creas­ingly dif­fi­cult to re­spond with a one-word an­swer to the de­cep­tively sim­ple ques­tion: “Where are you from?”</p>
    <p>From ev­ery place I have lived, I have ben­e­fited. In ev­ery place I have lived, I have hoped to be­long. More than just be­ing a reg­u­lar tax­payer, a good em­ployee or con­sid­er­ate neigh­bour, I have tried to add value.</p>
    <p>Whether that meant con­duct­ing science ex­per­i­ments for un­der­priv­i­leged mid­dle-school kids in Cal­i­for­nia, lob­by­ing for and set­ting up a child­care cen­tre in Hy­der­abad or vol­un­teer­ing at a soup kitchen in Sin­ga­pore, I have tried to be a pas­sion­ate con­trib­u­tor, not just a pas­sive con­sumer.</p>
    <p>A few weeks ago, a lit­tle girl ap­proached me at a bus stop. “Can you please lend me 60 cents for the bus? I for­got my EZ-link card.”</p>
    <p>As I handed over the money, I no­ticed the name of her pri­mary school on her uni­form.</p>
    <p>“Did you walk all this way? It’s so far away.”</p>
    <p>As she looked away shyly and boarded the next bus, my me­mory zoomed back to the times I had been at the re­ceiv­ing end of sim­ple acts of kind­ness.</p>
    <p>The pa­tient stranger who had given me di­rec­tions on that first day in Bal­ti­more and the gen­er­ous one who had paid for my din­ner one night when I had for­got­ten my wal­let.</p>
    <p>While there is give and take in ev­ery sit­u­a­tion, each in­ter­ac­tion is more than a mere trans­ac­tion. I owe a debt of grat­i­tude not just to com­mit­ted teach­ers and con­sid­er­ate bosses, but also to strangers who had reached out be­yond their com­fort zone. Their kind­ness left a mark on me along with the daily ban­ter with my class­mates, col­leagues and friends.</p>
    <p>It has been my good for­tune to learn the truth of the San­skrit phrase “Va­su­daiva Ku­tum­bakam” – the world is one fam­ily, on a global can­vas.</p>
