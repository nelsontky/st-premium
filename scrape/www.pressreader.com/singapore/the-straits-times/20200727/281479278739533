    <p>More than 100 Sin­ga­pore films and tele­vi­sion se­ries, in­clud­ing the ac­claimed fam­ily drama Ilo Ilo (2013) and com­ing-of-age tale Sand­cas­tle (2010), will be pro­gres­sively added to the Net­flix li­brary from Satur­day, ahead of Na­tional Day.</p>
    <p>This is made pos­si­ble fol­low­ing sev­eral part­ner­ships be­tween the stream­ing ser­vice gi­ant and lo­cal stu­dios such as Clover Films, mm2 En­ter­tain­ment and Me­di­a­corp, says Net­flix in a press re­lease.</p>
    <p>Mr Raphael Pang, Net­flix’s con­tent ac­qui­si­tion man­ager for South­east Asia, says: “By mak­ing th­ese ti­tles eas­ily ac­ces­si­ble through Net­flix, we hope it will reignite the joy they’ve brought to many Sin­ga­pore­ans over the decades, but more im­por­tantly, in­tro­duce th­ese great works of art by some of the best lo­cal film-mak­ers to the younger gen­er­a­tions.”</p>
    <p>The direc­tors and pro­duc­ers of the films and se­ries cel­e­brate the move, not­ing that their out­put will be ac­ces­si­ble to many more view­ers.</p>
    <p>Ilo Ilo direc­tor An­thony Chen is “al­ways heart­ened” by op­por­tu­ni­ties to in­tro­duce his work to new au­di­ences.</p>
    <p>“It’s been seven years af­ter the first re­lease of Ilo Ilo and I hope the film will con­tinue to touch the hearts of au­di­ences in Sin­ga­pore and across the re­gion, es­pe­cially if they are see­ing it for the first time,” he says of his Golden Horse Award­win­ning film, which is cen­tred on a Sin­ga­pore fam­ily and its do­mes­tic helper.</p>
    <p>Direc­tor Jack Neo, whose films – in­clud­ing Home­run (2003), I Not Stupid (2002) and Ah Boys To Men 2 (2013) – will be added to the li­brary, is happy that even more of his films and some of his “proud­est works” will be on Net­flix.</p>
    <p>His hit film Ah Boys To Men (2012), about a group of army re­cruits, is al­ready on the plat­form and has made it to Sin­ga­pore’s Top 10 most-watched list.</p>
    <p>Other works view­ers can look out for on Net­flix in­clude Kelvin Tong’s pe­riod film It’s A Great, Great World (2011), Michelle Chong’s com­edy Al­ready Fa­mous (2011) and Eric Khoo’s ac­claimed drama Mee Pok Man (1995).</p>
    <p>Iconic tele­vi­sion se­ries such as sit­coms Under One Roof (1995 to 2003) and Phua Chu Kang Pte Ltd (1997 to 2007), and fam­ily drama Grow­ing Up (1996 to 2001) will also be on the plat­form.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the ex­panded li­brary, Net­flix will up­date its user in­ter­face by lo­cal­is­ing cat­e­gory names, start­ing on Satur­day for a lim­ited pe­riod.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, hor­ror ti­tles will come under “Could Have Hap­pened In Yishun”, while shows about lux­ury homes and fash­ion will be grouped as “That Atas Life”.</p>
