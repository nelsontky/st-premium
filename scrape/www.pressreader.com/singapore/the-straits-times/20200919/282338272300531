    <p>CHAM­PAG­NOLE (France) • Den­mark’s Soren Kragh An­der­sen claimed his sec­ond au­da­cious solo stage win of the Tour de France yes­ter­day with a per­fectly-timed at­tack late in the 19th stage, an un­du­lat­ing 166.5km ride from Bourg en Bresse to Cham­pag­nole.</p>
    <p>The Sun­web rider, who also won the 14th stage in Lyon, jumped away from a group of late break­away rid­ers to give his team their third stage win this year af­ter Marc Hirschi’s vic­tory in the 12th stage.</p>
    <p>Slove­nian Luka Mezgec was sec­ond, and Bel­gian Jasper Stuyven fin­ished third, both 53 sec­onds be­hind, as Pri­moz Roglic re­tained the over­all leader’s yel­low jersey.</p>
    <p>“I have to say that, in the last kilo­me­tres, I was ac­tu­ally scream­ing in pure dis­be­lief. I got two stage wins on the same Tour de France… It’s in­cred­i­ble,” said Kragh An­der­sen.</p>
    <p>“When I saw who was in the break­away group, I re­alised I was in the mix with some of the best rid­ers of the world for this type of race.</p>
    <p>“I hon­estly didn’t know how to beat them, and I was on my limit too. But then I re­alised that, if I man­aged some­how to get a small gap, it may en­able me to pull it off… This is a mem­ory I will carry in my mind for the rest of my life.”</p>
    <p>Roglic leads near­est ri­val and fel­low Slove­nian Tadej Po­gacar by 57 sec­onds go­ing into to­day’s de­ci­sive in­di­vid­ual time trial, which should see the Jumbo Visma rider se­cure his maiden Tour ti­tle.</p>
    <p>Ire­land’s Sam Ben­nett kept three­time world cham­pion Peter Sa­gan at bay, even ex­tend­ing his lead in the points clas­si­fi­ca­tion to 55 points from 52. He is hop­ing to be­come the first Ir­ish­man to win the green jersey since Sean Kelly in 1989, while Slo­vakian Sa­gan is look­ing to claim it for a record-ex­tend­ing eighth time.</p>
    <p>France’s Remi Cav­agna was the only early break­away rider and the De­ce­un­inck-Quick Step rider, helped by a strong tail­wind, opened a de­cent gap. But he was caught by the bunch 50km from the fin­ish and sev­eral at­tacks took place within the group of 12 rid­ers, fea­tur­ing top sprint­ers and one-day race spe­cial­ists, who broke clear with 25km to go. Kragh An­der­sen then ac­cel­er­ated away and his move went unan­swered.</p>
