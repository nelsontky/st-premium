    <p>A pact un­der which Is­rael pledges to sus­pend its planned an­nex­a­tion of Pales­tinian lands in ex­change for a nor­mal­i­sa­tion of ties with the United Arab Emi­rates (UAE) was met with mixed re­ac­tions in Asia. The deal was strongly con­demned by the Pales­tinian lead­er­ship, which said it was a be­trayal of their cause.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia, which has the world’s largest Mus­lim pop­u­la­tion, has been tight-lipped about the United States-bro­kered diplo­matic ac­cord be­tween Is­rael and the United Arab Emi­rates (UAE).</p>
    <p>The ac­cord was an­nounced on</p>
    <p>Thurs­day and would see “full nor­mal­i­sa­tion of re­la­tions” be­tween the two coun­tries in ex­change for Is­rael sus­pend­ing an­nex­a­tion of the oc­cu­pied West Bank ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian For­eign Min­istry spokesman Teuku Faiza­syah, when con­tacted by The Straits Times last night, said the min­istry had “so far no com­ment” on the agree­ment.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­den­tial spokesman Fad­jroel Rach­man de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>Jakarta-based in­ter­na­tional af­fairs ob­server Yon Mach­mudi told lo­cal news por­tal liputan6.com that In­done­sia had no choice but to re­spect the UAE, but the gov­ern­ment must speak louder and re­mind other coun­tries in the Mid­dle East to keep push­ing for a two-state so­lu­tion to en­sure Pales­tine’s in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>“The ac­cord hurt the Pales­tini­ans… and made them fur­ther marginalis­ed for the sake of the eco­nomic in­ter­est of the coun­tries in the Mid­dle East,” Mr Yon said in a text-mes­sage re­ply to The Straits Times last night.</p>
    <p>Mr Zuhairi Misrawi, a noted aca­demic from In­done­sia’s largest Is­lamic or­gan­i­sa­tion, Nahd­latul Ulama, urged the In­done­sian gov­ern­ment to con­tinue to help Pales­tine, in line with the coun­try’s Con­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>“In­done­sians should re­spect the peace deal, but our com­mit­ment to help­ing Pales­tine will never fade away,” Mr Zuhairi was quoted as say­ing by liputan6.com. He told The Straits Times that In­done­sia should not ac­cept the nar­ra­tive of­fered by the US, Is­rael and UAE.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia was the first coun­try to recog­nise Pales­tinian in­de­pen­dence after the dec­la­ra­tion of the state of</p>
    <p>Pales­tine in Al­ge­ria on Nov 15, 1988.</p>
    <p>Mixed re­ac­tions came from other Asian coun­tries, with China hail­ing the peace deal and Malaysia’s former prime min­is­ter crit­i­cis­ing it.</p>
    <p>“China is happy to see mea­sures that are help­ing to ease ten­sions be­tween coun­tries in the Mid­dle East and pro­mot­ing re­gional peace and sta­bil­ity,” said For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Lijian, adding that he hoped “con­crete ac­tions” would be taken to bring the is­sue of Pales­tine back to the ne­go­ti­at­ing ta­ble soon.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s former prime min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mohamad warned that the land­mark ac­cord was a step back­wards for peace and would di­vide the Mus­lim world into war­ring fac­tions, and that “Is­raelis will add fuel to the fire”, the South China Morn­ing Post re­ported.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said on Thurs­day the ac­cord would lead to greater co­op­er­a­tion in in­vest­ment, tourism, se­cu­rity, tech­nol­ogy, en­ergy and other ar­eas.</p>
    <p>PRO­MOT­ING PEACE</p>
    <p>China is happy to see mea­sures that are help­ing to ease ten­sions be­tween coun­tries in the Mid­dle East and pro­mot­ing re­gional peace and</p>
    <p>’’ sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>CHINA’S FOR­EIGN MIN­ISTRY SPOKESMAN ZHAO LIJIAN</p>
    <p>COM­MIT­MENT TO PALES­TINE In­done­sians should re­spect the peace deal, but our com­mit­ment to help­ing Pales­tine will ’’ never fade away.</p>
    <p>MR ZUHAIRI MISRAWI, an aca­demic from In­done­sia’s largest Is­lamic or­gan­i­sa­tion, Nahd­latul Ulama.</p>
    <p>RE­WARD FOR CRIMES</p>
    <p>The agree­ment with the UAE is a re­ward for the Is­raeli oc­cu­pa­tion and ’’ crimes.</p>
    <p>MR HAZEM QASEM, spokesman for Pales­tinian Is­lamist group Ha­mas, which con­trols the Gaza Strip.</p>
