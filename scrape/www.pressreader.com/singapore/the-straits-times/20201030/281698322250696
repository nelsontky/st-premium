    <p>JUST AD­VICE</p>
    <p>Ad­vice is ad­vice and we hope it is ad­hered to, but it is not il­le­gal... to take a dif­fer­ent po­si­tion as it is their (MPs’) right. But we do hope His Majesty’s call is given a</p>
    <p>’’ se­ri­ous con­sid­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>TAN SRI ANNUAR MUSA, sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the Barisan Na­sional coali­tion.</p>
    <p>We must not lose sight of the con­text within which the royal de­cree was made – the coun­try is deal­ing with the Covid-19 pan­demic. MPs were there­fore re­minded that na­tional in­ter­est must take pri­or­ity over per­sonal in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>The call by the Malaysian King for fed­eral law­mak­ers to ap­prove the up­com­ing bud­get has raised a stir, with some ques­tion­ing whether he has over­stepped his con­sti­tu­tional limit.</p>
    <p>Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah on Wed­nes­day called on MPs to “give ful­some sup­port” for Bud­get 2021, which will be pre­sented in Par­lia­ment next week.</p>
    <p>A state­ment is­sued by the na­tional palace said: “Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah ad­vises MPs to give ful­some sup­port to Bud­get 2021 for the peo­ple’s well-be­ing and con­ti­nu­ity of their lives, as well as to help the na­tion’s econ­omy, which has been af­fected by the Covid-19 pan­demic, re­cover.”</p>
    <p>The King had ear­lier met Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin, who dis­cussed with him the con­tents of the bud­get for next year.</p>
    <p>Con­sti­tu­tional lawyer Ger­ard Lorde­samy wrote that it is not the con­sti­tu­tional role of the sov­er­eign to ad­vise MPs on the mat­ter as the prime min­is­ter is an­swer­able to Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>“That is the core of our par­lia­men­tary democ­racy. A health pan­demic is not a valid rea­son to weaken the ba­sic struc­ture of the Con­sti­tu­tion,” he wrote on Wed­nes­day on the Malaysi­akini news site. “It is equally ir­re­spon­si­ble for a prime min­is­ter who is plagued with po­lit­i­cal is­sues from within his own ranks and also ex­ter­nally to hide be­hind the Crown to save him­self by re­sort­ing to con­sti­tu­tional jug­ger­nauts and som­er­saults,” Mr Lorde­samy added.</p>
    <p>But oth­ers said the King has not</p>
    <p>MR NIZAM BASHIR, a con­sti­tu­tional lawyer.</p>
    <p>over­stepped his con­sti­tu­tional role as the con­text of his in­ter­ven­tion must be taken into ac­count.</p>
    <p>Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah had on Sun­day re­jected Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s re­quest for the King to in­voke a na­tional emer­gency.</p>
    <p>An emer­gency de­cree would al­low Mr Muhyid­din to push through the an­nual ex­pen­di­ture with­out a par­lia­men­tary vote.</p>
    <p>By par­lia­men­tary con­ven­tion, the fail­ure to pass a sup­ply Bill to fund the gov­ern­ment is akin to a no-con­fi­dence mo­tion. In this case, the event would re­sult in the col­lapse of the Muhyid­din ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Barisan Na­sional sec­re­tary-gen­eral Annuar Musa said yes­ter­day that the mes­sage from the ruler was just “ad­vice”.</p>
    <p>“Ad­vice is ad­vice and we hope it is ad­hered to, but it is not il­le­gal... to take a dif­fer­ent po­si­tion as it is their (MPs’) right,” Tan Sri Annuar told re­porters. “But we do hope His Majesty’s call is given a se­ri­ous con­sid­er­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Sun­way Univer­sity po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Wong Chin Huat said while the “royal ad­vice” would likely help Mr Muhyid­din avoid out­right de­feats in the se­cond and third read­ing of the bud­get, the King’s in­ter­ven­tion is un­usual. This is be­cause one of Par­lia­ment’s key func­tions is to scru­ti­nise and ap­prove the bud­get, he said.</p>
    <p>Giv­ing his take on the King’s in­ter­ven­tion, con­sti­tu­tional lawyer Nizam Bashir said the con­text matters.</p>
    <p>“We must not lose sight of the con­text within which the royal de­cree was made – the coun­try is deal­ing with the Covid-19 pan­demic. MPs were there­fore re­minded that na­tional in­ter­est must take pri­or­ity over per­sonal in­ter­est,” Mr Nizam told ST.</p>
    <p>Univer­siti Malaya po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst Awang Az­man Awang Pawi said Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah’s ad­vice does not equate in­ter­fer­ence. “At the end of the day, MPs have the right and free­dom to in­di­vid­u­ally, or in a group, ex­press their views in Par­lia­ment. Whether they’re for or against the bud­get, it doesn’t mean t hey’re dis­loyal to t he King,” he said.</p>

The King&#x2019;s call for MPs to &#x201C;give ful&#xAD;some sup&#xAD;port&#x201D; for Bud&#xAD;get 2021 has raised some eye&#xAD;brows.</p>
