    <p>Barcelona coach Ron­ald Koe­man was glow­ing with pride af­ter his side’s 3-2 away win over Ath­letic Bil­bao on Wed­nes­day and said the per­for­mance was a bench­mark for the re­main­der of the La Liga sea­son.</p>
    <p>Barca fell be­hind in the third minute to an Inaki Wil­liams goal dur­ing a counter-at­tack. But they re­sponded em­phat­i­cally with goals from teenager Pedri and a resur­gent Lionel Messi ei­ther side of half-time be­fore Iker Mu­ni­ain struck late for the hosts.</p>
    <p>“That’s the way we need to con­tinue. We con­trolled the game the whole time and there were barely any dips in our play,” Koe­man said.</p>
    <p>The win lifted Barca into third place in the La Liga stand­ings and led the Dutch­man to re­assess pre­vi­ous pes­simistic com­ments about his side’s faint chances of catch­ing lead­ers Atletico Madrid (38 points), who lead Real by two points and are ahead of the Cata­lans by seven points with two games in hand.</p>
    <p>“The ti­tle race is still open be­cause the sea­son is very long. There can be in­juries, teams can have down­turns and a side that looks very good can end up strug­gling,” Koe­man said.</p>
    <p>He also praised Messi, who pro­duced ar­guably his best per­for­mance of the sea­son and was un­lucky not to grab a hat-trick.</p>
    <p>On 18-year-old play­maker Pedri, who served up Messi’s first goal with an out­ra­geous back­heel into his path, Koe­man added: “He plays with so much ma­tu­rity de­spite his age and most im­por­tantly he uses his head.”</p>
