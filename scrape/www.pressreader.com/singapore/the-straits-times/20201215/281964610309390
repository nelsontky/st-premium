    <p>The cur­rent pan­demic has raised ques­tions about Singapore’s food se­cu­rity, espe­cially in view of cli­mate change (S’pore boost­ing pro­duc­tion of food lo­cally amid Covid-19, Nov 30).</p>
    <p>Singapore is a small na­tion with lim­ited land re­sources where a small per­cent­age is used as agri­cul­tural land and 90 per cent of the food sup­ply is im­ported. In this sce­nario, the dream of at­tain­ing self-suf­fi­ciency in food pro­duc­tion seems far-fetched but is not im­pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Fo­cus must be on three food S’s: se­cu­rity, self-suf­fi­ciency and sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment plans to in­crease food self-suf­fi­ciency to 30 per cent by 2030. This will be achieved pri­mar­ily through fish­ery and aqua­cul­ture, as well as by em­ploy­ing ur­ban, high-tech, in­no­va­tive farm­ing meth­ods.</p>
    <p>How­ever, given space con­straints and the fluc­tu­at­ing world food sup­ply, un­con­ven­tional and al­ter­na­tive food op­tions will have to be ex­plored. This need for dis­rup­tion paves the way for al­ter­na­tive food choices such as cul­tured meat (lab-grown meats), im­i­ta­tion meats (non-meat prod­ucts that mimic meat’s tex­ture, taste and</p>
    <p>ap­pear­ance) and highly nu­tri­tious foods (which in­clude al­gae such as spir­ulina and chlorella).</p>
    <p>The ben­e­fit of th­ese food op­tions is that they re­quire much less land and have lower car­bon foot­prints. Spir­ulina, for ex­am­ple, is rich in pro­tein, vi­ta­mins and min­er­als. It re­quires lit­tle land and lit­tle water.</p>
    <p>An­other area of fo­cus could be</p>
    <p>lo­cally grown al­ter­na­tive pro­tein-rich fish feed for lo­cal fish farms, which is safer for marine ecosys­tems and is sus­tain­able.</p>
    <p>Shifts in diet and con­sump­tion habits take time. How­ever, the good news is that mil­len­ni­als are more open to changes. A re­cent col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween a Singapore-based start-up and a ho­tel group in­tro­duced spir­ulina</p>
    <p>pasta that was quite well re­ceived. There has also been a pos­i­tive re­sponse to lab-grown seafood.</p>
    <p>Changes in con­sumer be­hav­iour and di­etary habits take time and ef­fort, but when com­bined with food waste re­duc­tion, it can lead to a sus­tain­able food sys­tem, health­ier food habits and greater food se­cu­rity for Singapore.</p>
