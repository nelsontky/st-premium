    <p>“I’ve mea­sured out my life in cof­fee spoons,” wrote Modernist poet T.S. Eliot in The Love Song Of J. Al­fred Prufrock. In the play Cafe, life is mea­sured out in cups of cof­fee and the bill creeps up on you.</p>
    <p>Two sec­ondary school friends, now a suc­cess­ful ac­coun­tant and a civil ser­vant, meet in a cafe on a rainy af­ter­noon to trade shal­low gos­sip, In­sta­gram their brunch and snipe at the wait­staff.</p>
    <p>But out­side the cafe, some</p>
    <p>thing is strangely, in­ex­press­ibly wrong. The rain gets heav­ier. Phone re­cep­tion is down. The milk sours, the lights flicker and grad­u­ally, peo­ple dis­ap­pear.</p>
    <p>“Why are we here?” the char­ac­ters ask. “I want to go home.” And yet they linger in the cafe, talk­ing in cir­cles and pour­ing end­less lat­tes.</p>
    <p>Cafe, the sec­ond of four plays in Wild Rice’s res­i­dency pro­gramme for young di­rec­tors, is helmed by</p>
    <p>Hazel Ho.</p>
    <p>She has made a clever choice with Joel Tan’s ex­is­ten­tial dark com­edy, which was first staged at The Twenty-Some­thing Theatre Fes­ti­val in 2016 and was a con­tender for Best Orig­i­nal Script at the M1-The Straits Times Life Theatre Awards.</p>
    <p>In her hands, Cafe is a dark, po­tent brew with plenty of acid notes.</p>
    <p>The set, an un­der­stated but ef­fec­tive de­sign by Wong Chee Wai, is split into two lev­els, with the ta­ble above and the bar – com­plete with a func­tion­ing espresso ma­chine – be­low, de­lin­eat­ing the classes of the servers and the served.</p>
    <p>Seong Hui Xuan ex­cels as cus­tomer-from-hell Jae­clyn, blithely de­ter­mined to keep her com­pan­ion Shireen (El­iz­a­beth Loh) cap­tive with catty chat­ter and un­sub­tle one-up­man­ship. Jae­clyn is ap­palling to watch, yet also dis­turbingly fa­mil­iar.</p>
    <p>On the other side of the counter are “the es­sen­tial workers”, led by man­ager Zat (Adib Kos­nan), who tries to keep in check part-timer El (Ants Chua), a brit­tle anx­i­ety suf­ferer, and Kim (Dar­ren Guo), an ex-con­vict strug­gling to make ends meet for his young fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Guo in­hab­its his role with a par­tic­u­lar in­ten­sity, es­pe­cially in the painfully awk­ward scene when his char­ac­ter at­tempts to sell the cus­tomers key­chains – point­ing out that at $6 each, they cost around as much as a Star­bucks cof­fee – only to be hu­mil­i­ated by Jae­clyn.</p>
    <p>Sim­mer­ing be­neath the sur­face laughs are ugly ten­sions around class priv­i­lege, in­come in­equal­ity and the ways the for­mer per­pet­u­ates the de­nial of the lat­ter.</p>
    <p>One hopes this will not be Cafe’s last or­der. It is a play that is hard to sleep on.</p>
