    <p>PARIS • The at­mos­phere of Venus con­tains a gas that on Earth can be at­trib­uted to liv­ing or­gan­isms, sci­en­tists have said. It is a dis­cov­ery the head of the Na­tional Aero­nau­tics and Space Ad­min­is­tra­tion (Nasa) called “the most sig­nif­i­cant de­vel­op­ment yet” in the hunt for ex­trater­res­trial life.</p>
    <p>Con­di­tions on Earth’s plan­e­tary neigh­bour are of­ten de­scribed as hellish with day­time tem­per­a­tures hot enough to melt lead and an at­mos­phere com­prised al­most en­tirely of car­bon diox­ide. How­ever, a team of ex­perts de­tected traces of phos­phine, a flammable gas that on Earth of­ten oc­curs from the break­down of or­ganic mat­ter. They used tele­scopes in Hawaii and Chile’s Ata­cama Desert to ob­serve Venus’ up­per cloud deck, around 60km from the sur­face.</p>
    <p>Writ­ing in Na­ture Astron­omy on Mon­day, the team stressed the pres­ence of phos­phine did not prove the pres­ence of life on Venus. But, as the clouds swirling about its broil­ing sur­face are highly acidic and there­fore de­stroy phos­phine very quickly, the re­search did show that some­thing was cre­at­ing it anew.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers con­ducted sev­eral mod­el­ling cal­cu­la­tions in a bid to ex­plain the new phos­phine pro­duc­tion. They con­cluded that their re­search pro­vided ev­i­dence “for anoma­lous and un­ex­plained chem­istry” on Venus.</p>
    <p>The break­through was hailed by Nasa ad­min­is­tra­tor Jim Bri­den­s­tine, who tweeted, “it’s time to pri­ori­tise Venus”.</p>
    <p>Other plan­e­tary sci­en­tists counter that a non-bi­o­log­i­cal ori­gin can­not be ruled out. “De­spite prior spec­u­la­tion (mostly by the same au­thors), this can hardly be taken as a biosig­na­ture,” Dr Ger­ald Joyce, a bi­ol­o­gist at the Salk In­sti­tute in Cal­i­for­nia, said in an e-mail.</p>
    <p>The bulk of current ef­forts to look for past ex­trater­res­trial life fo­cuses on Mars, known to have once con­tained all the nec­es­sary ingredient­s to sup­port car­bon-based or­gan­isms. The United States and China re­cently sent rovers to the Red Planet, while the United Arab Emi­rates sent an at­mo­spheric probe.</p>
    <p>Venus, which ro­tates in the op­po­site di­rec­tion to Earth and where a day lasts 243 times longer, is a sub­ject of in­tense in­ter­est among astronomer­s. It is so close and of such sim­i­lar size to Earth that some ex­perts be­lieve it serves as a warn­ing of the dan­gers of run­away cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ous stud­ies have un­earthed tan­ta­lis­ing clues sug­gest­ing Venus has ac­tive vol­ca­noes, in­clud­ing signs of re­cent lava flows.</p>
