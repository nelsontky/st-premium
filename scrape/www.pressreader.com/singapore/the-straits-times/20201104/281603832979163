    <p>De­spite not be­ing able to op­er­ate since March, the owner of a night­club has been chalk­ing up debts from a run­ning lease that will ex­pire only in March next year.</p>
    <p>Mov­ing to another busi­ness model such as food and bev­er­age­would be dif­fi­cult as his work­ers have re­turned to their home coun­tries. Adding to his woes is the high cost of ter­mi­nat­ing the lease, with some nightlife busi­nesses hav­ing early ter­mi­na­tion fees of around $250,000.</p>
    <p>Changes to the law ap­proved by Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day will be a life­line for such busi­nesses badly hit by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Law Ed­win Tong cited this ex­am­ple of an ap­peal the min­istry re­ceived in mak­ing the case for small and mi­cro busi­nesses to be al­lowed to ter­mi­nate cer­tain com­mer­cial con­tracts with­out penalty un­der the Re­Align Frame­work if they are un­able to rene­go­ti­ate new terms.</p>
    <p>Such busi­nesses have lim­ited ne­go­ti­at­ing power and are most in need of help, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong, who is also Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth, was mak­ing the case for the third set of amend­ments to the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act.</p>
    <p>The frame­work cov­ers small and mi­cro busi­nesses, with a pre­scribed an­nual rev­enue cap, that have seen a sig­nif­i­cant fall in rev­enue. Details will be given at a later date.</p>
    <p>It cov­ers con­tracts gov­erned by Sin­ga­pore law, en­tered into be­fore March 25 and ter­mi­nated from Nov 2. One of the par­ties must also have a place of busi­ness in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>These con­tracts may be leases or li­cences for com­mer­cial prop­erty; the sale and pur­chase of goods and ser­vices; and rental, hire-pur­chase or con­di­tional sales agree­ments for com­mer­cial equip­ment and ve­hi­cles, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Once the amended Act com­mences, busi­nesses will have only six weeks to en­ter into rene­go­ti­a­tions by serv­ing no­tice to the other con­trac­tual party or par­ties.</p>
    <p>Par­ties will then have a manda­tory four weeks to rene­go­ti­ate the terms. If they fail to agree on new terms, con­tracts can be ter­mi­nated with­out penalty. Any ear­lier debts and li­a­bil­i­ties from the con­tract will still con­tinue to stand.</p>
    <p>Par­ties who dis­agree on the busi­ness’ el­i­gi­bil­ity to be cov­ered un­der the frame­work or the amount owed upon ter­mi­na­tion of the con­tract can seek an as­ses­sor ap­pointed by the Min­istry of Law to make the fi­nal de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>Ex­plain­ing the frame­work, Mr Tong noted that the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act was passed in April, al­low­ing busi­nesses and in­di­vid­u­als to de­fer cer­tain con­trac­tual obli­ga­tions with­out penalty for a re­lief pe­riod of six months.</p>
    <p>But the re­lief pe­riod can­not be pro­longed and mea­sures can­not be con­tin­ued in­def­i­nitely.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Tong: “We will risk sus­tain­ing busi­nesses that are no longer vi­able. It would trap and lock away pre­cious eco­nomic ca­pac­i­ties such as work­ers, or prop­erty and as­sets, and this, in the longer term, would be dam­ag­ing</p>
    <p>for our economy.”</p>
    <p>In­stead, the Gov­ern­ment is now mov­ing to­wards help­ing busi­nesses – par­tic­u­larly smaller ones – to fo­cus on re­cov­er­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong shared an ex­am­ple of a mall ten­ant who has a dras­tic fall in earn­ings to around $3,000 a month, after safe man­age­ment bar­ri­ers were put up near his shops.</p>
    <p>His lease, which costs $9,000 a month and was signed be­fore the pan­demic hit, would end only in Oc­to­ber next year.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter shared that the ten­ant had ap­proached his land­lord, hop­ing to ne­go­ti­ate a tem­po­rary re­duc­tion in rent un­til things im­prove.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, in this case, his land­lord will not en­ter­tain any dis­cus­sions,” said Mr Tong. “On the other hand, if he ter­mi­nates the con­tract be­fore his lease ends next year, he will have to pay sub­stan­tial dam­ages for early ter­mi­na­tion.”</p>
    <p>“He is there­fore stuck in this po­si­tion, and con­tin­ues to bleed. If noth­ing changes, it is likely that he will breach the ten­ancy.</p>
    <p>“If the ar­rears or com­pen­sa­tion for ter­mi­na­tion is not paid, par­ties will end up in lit­i­ga­tion and the ten­ant might end up in­sol­vent.”</p>
    <p>Such sit­u­a­tions are not in the in­ter­ests of the par­ties, or for the greater over­all good of Sin­ga­pore’s economy, as busi­nesses will close down with a likely un­re­cov­er­able moun­tain of debt, and jobs will be lost while busi­nesses and cred­i­tors tus­sle in court, he said.</p>
    <p>In the case of the mall ten­ant, he had en­tered into the lease con­tract be­fore Covid-19 amid a dif­fer­ent busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment and op­er­at­ing as­sump­tions, and is now un­able to com­ply with obli­ga­tions through no fault of his own, said Mr Tong.</p>
    <p>The right to ter­mi­nate his lease un­der the new frame­work will give the ten­ant some lever­age to rene­go­ti­ate the terms of the con­tract.</p>
    <p>Ex­cep­tions will ap­ply to cer­tain small land­lords to re­ceive ad­di­tional com­pen­sa­tion that will be de­ter­mined by an as­ses­sor, as they are likely to face hard­ship if ten­ants ter­mi­nate their leases.</p>
    <p>Hir­ers and renters of com­mer­cial equip­ment and ve­hi­cles will also be able to seek up to 18 months to re­pay their loans un­der a statu­tory repayment scheme, in­stead of ter­mi­nat­ing their con­tracts, with in­ter­est capped at 5 per cent per an­num.</p>
    <p>This is a nec­es­sary op­tion for some busi­nesses, as they need the equip­ment or ve­hi­cles to main­tain their liveli­hoods, said Mr Tong.</p>
