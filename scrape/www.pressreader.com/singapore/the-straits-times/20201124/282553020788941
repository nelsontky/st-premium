    <p>Bees may ap­pear fright­ful to many but one man, who calls him­self a “friend of the bees”, wants to debunk people’s fears of his small, buzzy com­pan­ions.</p>
    <p>For­mer vice-prin­ci­pal John Chong, 61, is the founder of three­year-old api­ary Bee Amazed Gar­den. It is lo­cated within GroundUp Ini­tia­tive, a non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion in Yishun that aims to demon­strate ur­ban sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>As part of the My Com­mu­nity Fes­ti­val, vis­i­tors will learn about bee­keep­ing, put on a bee suit and get up close to a hive.</p>
    <p>The last one may cause some anx­i­ety for those afraid of in­sects. To lift a hon­ey­comb crawl­ing with bees and hear a stray in­sect buzz around one’s head is star­tling, even from within the safety of a bee jacket.</p>
    <p>But if you know how to ap­proach the bees – slowly, with­out sud­den move­ments – and stay out of their flight path, they are likely to leave you alone, says Mr Chong, demon­strat­ing by plac­ing his un­pro­tected hands and face near a buzzing comb.</p>
    <p>Learn­ing about bees in 2016, first on his own and later from two bee­keep­ers in Aus­tralia, he found he iden­ti­fied with their char­ac­ter­is­tics.</p>
    <p>Bees are not de­signed for fly­ing, he says. Their bod­ies are not stream­lined and aero­dy­namic. But flap­ping their wings hun­dreds of times a sec­ond keeps them aloft.</p>
    <p>“Bees are hard­work­ing and ded­i­cated to their colony, never give up and suc­ceed against the odds,” he says.</p>
    <p>Mr Chong’s own jour­ney mir­rors this. Grow­ing up in a kam­pung in Klu­ang, Johor, he was a late bloomer and did not speak un­til he was five.</p>
    <p>Home was a wooden at­taproofed hut that leaked when it rained. The fam­ily used a bucket for a toi­let.</p>
    <p>See­ing his friends live in bet­ter con­di­tions, with flush toi­lets, left him with an in­se­cu­rity that lin­gered un­til his 20s.</p>
    <p>When he moved to Sin­ga­pore aged 20 to take up a teach­ing job, he rented a wooden hut in Cle­menti for $30 a month. A nearby pond dou­bled as his la­trine.</p>
    <p>Each day, he walked past Hous­ing Board flats and bun­ga­lows to get to work, silently com­par­ing him­self with their res­i­dents. “I felt like a no­body, like good things were not meant for me,” he says.</p>
    <p>The turn­ing point came when, one day, a stu­dent called him a “hero” for help­ing him un­der­stand math­e­mat­ics prob­lems.</p>
    <p>For the next few decades, he poured his heart and soul into teach­ing, in­clud­ing an eight-year stint in Hong Kong where he taught at an in­ter­na­tional school.</p>
    <p>There, he took night classes to­wards a bach­e­lor’s de­gree and later a master’s de­gree in phys­i­cal ed­u­ca­tion and sports science at the Univer­sity of Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>“It was a very pro­duc­tive trip. My wife and I went to Hong Kong with two suit­cases; we came back with two de­grees and two kids,” quips Mr Chong. His wife, 59, is a vi­ceprin­ci­pal at a pri­mary school.</p>
    <p>Yet, back in Sin­ga­pore, people never stopped ques­tion­ing him.</p>
    <p>When he be­came a vice- prin­ci­pal, they asked if his “nice, soft per­son­al­ity” would get in the way.</p>
    <p>When he took up bee­keep­ing, they won­dered why he would de­vote his re­tire­ment years to a com­pletely new ven­ture.</p>
    <p>Mr Chong was non­plussed. His api­ary, he says, is the re­sult of “learn­ing, hard work and train­ing” – traits he hopes to im­part to young vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>Bee Amazed Gar­den hosts classes and work­shops for stu­dents and fam­i­lies, as well as con­ducts cor­po­rate train­ing. Mr Chong has also taught about 10 hob­by­ist bee­keep­ers and hopes they can col­lec­tively pro­duce lo­cal honey in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Most im­por­tantly, how­ever, he wants to en­cour­age a bee-friendly so­ci­ety in Sin­ga­pore, where people do not call pest-con­trol ser­vices to de­stroy hives, but in­stead live in har­mony with them.</p>
    <p>He be­lieves this can come from be­ing less afraid of bees and un­der­stand­ing their role in ecol­ogy, point­ing out that about a third of the world’s crops rely, to an ex­tent, on bee pol­li­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Only then can Sin­ga­pore con­sider it­self a thriv­ing, nat­u­ral gar­den city, he says.</p>
    <p>“In Sin­ga­pore, we are taught to cher­ish what we have, not to waste food and to cher­ish ev­ery drop of wa­ter. Shouldn’t we say the same of our bees and flow­ers too?” BEE AMAZED GAR­DEN TOUR</p>
