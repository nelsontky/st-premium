    <p>The can­cel­la­tion of the high-speed rail project to link Kuala Lumpur and Sin­ga­pore has raised spec­u­la­tion that the Malaysian govern­ment will in­stead build a KL to Johor Baru HSR line.</p>
    <p>But ex­perts say a do­mes­tic HSR line could end up as a white ele­phant.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment is al­ready build­ing a dou­ble­track elec­tric train ser­vice to link JB to KL, and with the line go­ing all the way to Perlis be­side south­ern Thai­land.</p>
    <p>A do­mes­tic high-speed rail net­work in Malaysia alone is not fea­si­ble and likely to end up a white ele­phant if it is built, trans­port an­a­lysts said.</p>
    <p>The Malaysian govern­ment had, prior to the ex­piry of the sus­pen­sion pe­riod of the Kuala LumpurSin­ga­pore High Speed Rail (HSR) project, an­nounced that it will con­duct a study on the vi­a­bil­ity of a do­mes­tic high-speed rail net­work, with the line end­ing in Johor Baru in Malaysia, in­stead of Jurong East in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Malaysian trans­porta­tion con­sul­tant Y.S. Chan said that un­less Malaysia has a huge pop­u­la­tion like China’s, a do­mes­tic high-speed rail net­work would not work.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan, who was pre­vi­ously with the Tourism Min­istry, told The Sun­day Times: “There are no is­sues with cur­rent air, rail and road con­nec­tiv­ity (to Johor Baru).</p>
    <p>“But if we need to spend to spur the econ­omy and pre­pare for the fu­ture, ex­tend­ing the West Coast Ex­press­way, now from Taiping to Bant­ing (yet to be com­pleted), all the way down the west coast to cover Port Dick­son, Me­laka, Muar, Batu Pa­hat, Pon­tian and Johor Baru, would be a bet­ter op­tion.”</p>
    <p>He added: “As for rail, the dou­ble-track­ing from Ge­mas, Negeri Sem­bi­lan, to Johor Baru would be com­pleted next year and we can have fast trains all the way from Padang Be­sar, at the Thai bor­der, down to JB.”</p>
    <p>Dou­ble-track rail­way sys­tems run one track in each di­rec­tion, in­stead of hav­ing one track for trains in both di­rec­tions.</p>
    <p>“Another rail­way line would be re­dun­dant... it is likely to be­come a white ele­phant or a long python stretch­ing from KL to JB,” said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>Malaysia and Sin­ga­pore had on Fri­day an­nounced that the KL-Sin­ga­pore HSR project was ter­mi­nated.</p>
    <p>It came af­ter both coun­tries failed to reach an agree­ment on changes pro­posed by Malaysia be­fore the end of the sus­pen­sion pe­riod on Dec 31 last year.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of Trans­port said in a sep­a­rate state­ment that Malaysia had al­lowed the HSR bi­lat­eral agree­ment to lapse, and has to com­pen­sate Sin­ga­pore for costs al­ready in­curred in ac­cor­dance with the agree­ment.</p>
    <p>The 350km link be­tween Kuala Lumpur and Sin­ga­pore would have cost an estimated RM60 bil­lion ($19.5 bil­lion) to RM80 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Slated for com­ple­tion in 2031, it would have slashed travel times be­tween the coun­tries, ramped up trade and boosted tourism.</p>
    <p>Towns sit­u­ated at key stops along the line in Malaysia had been ex­pect­ing to wel­come mil­lions of ring­git in de­vel­op­ment and in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>EX­PLORE AL­TER­NA­TIVES</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on Fri­day, Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Depart­ment Mustapa Mo­hamed said the Malaysian govern­ment will con­duct a de­tailed study to ex­plore all al­ter­na­tives, in­clud­ing the vi­a­bil­ity of a do­mes­tic high-speed rail net­work.</p>
    <p>For­mer trans­port min­is­ter An­thony Loke la­belled the idea as “non­sen­si­cal” and “re­dun­dant”, adding that there is al­ready a train line run­ning from Johor Baru to Kuala Lumpur.</p>
    <p>Chim­ing in, for­mer prime min­is­ter Na­jib Razak called on the govern­ment to be more trans­par­ent in its plans for al­ter­na­tives to the KLSin­ga­pore HSR, with­out us­ing Covid-19 or the econ­omy as an ex­cuse.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Malaysian As­so­ci­a­tion of Tour and Travel Agents pres­i­dent Tan Kok Liang said the can­cel­la­tion of the project is a bless­ing in dis­guise for the coun­try’s tourism sec­tor, as the project would have re­duced Malaysian air­ports and cruise ports to mere feeder providers in­stead of be­com­ing key trans­port play­ers.</p>
    <p>“The HSR, there­fore, ac­tu­ally con­sol­i­dates Sin­ga­pore’s po­si­tion as a ma­jor trans­porta­tion hub at the ex­pense of our coun­try’s tourism rev­enue,” he was quoted as say­ing on Fri­day by the New Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party branch in Johor is urg­ing Pu­tra­jaya to pro­pose a re­place­ment trans­port in­fra­struc­ture project to drive the state’s eco­nomic growth and en­hance re­gional con­nec­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Public trans­port re­searcher SM Sabri SM Is­mail said the govern­ment should now re­set and ex­plore al­ter­na­tives to a do­mes­tic high-speed rail net­work.</p>
    <p>These could in­clude an up­grade to the ex­ist­ing na­tional Kere­tapi Tanah Me­layu (KTM) rail­way net­work, and an ex­ten­sion of the in­ter-city Elec­tric Train Ser­vice (ETS) sys­tem, to run from Kuala Lumpur to Johor Baru.</p>
    <p>“The study should of course in­clude com­par­isons of the vi­a­bil­ity of a KL-JB HSR (with re­vised align­ment in Johor) sys­tem ver­sus up­grad­ing the KL-JB cur­rent me­tre­gauge dou­ble-track rail­way.</p>
    <p>“I don’t see any good ter­mi­nal lo­ca­tion in JB for a sep­a­rate KL-JB HSR (but) if a ‘higher’ speed rail is re­ally needed in JB, up­grad­ing KTM’s ETS and the KL-JB me­tre­gauge tracks would make more sense,” he told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>Like Mr Chan, Mr Sabri said that even with­out an up­grade to the ETS net­work, to al­low for high­speed trains, the com­ple­tion of the Ge­mas-JB elec­tric dou­ble­track­ing project will en­able ETS trains to run from Kuala Lumpur to Johor Baru.</p>
    <p>“It would pro­vide much eas­ier train ser­vice for pas­sen­gers from KL to JB, with­out hav­ing to change trains at Ge­mas (in Negeri Sem­bi­lan).</p>
    <p>“If both op­tions (re­vised HSR align­ment and an ETS up­grade) are not fi­nan­cially or eco­nom­i­cally vi­able, then we don’t re­ally need it,” he added.</p>
    <p>The Ge­mas ETS project, at a cost of RM10 bil­lion, would link Johor’s cap­i­tal city to Kuala Lumpur and all the way north to Padang Be­sar in Perlis.</p>
    <p>A WHITE ELE­PHANT</p>
    <p>Another rail­way line would be re­dun­dant... it is likely to be­come a white ele­phant or a long python stretch­ing from KL to JB.</p>
