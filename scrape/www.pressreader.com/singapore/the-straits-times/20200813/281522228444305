    <p>BER­LIN/MOSCOW • Ger­man Health Min­is­ter Jens Spahn said yes­ter­day that Rus­sia’s Covid-19 vac­cine has not been tested suf­fi­ciently, adding that the aim is to have a safe prod­uct rather than just to be the first to vac­ci­nate peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin an­nounced on Tues­day that Rus­sia had be­come the first coun­try to grant reg­u­la­tory ap­proval to a Covid-19 vac­cine af­ter less than two months of hu­man test­ing. It will start mass in­oc­u­la­tion this month.</p>
    <p>Moscow’s de­ci­sion to grant ap­proval be­fore fi­nal tri­als have been com­pleted has raised con­cerns.</p>
    <p>Mr Spahn told ra­dio broad­caster Deutsch­land­funk: “It can be dan­ger­ous to start vac­ci­nat­ing mil­lions, if not bil­lions, of peo­ple too early be­cause it could pretty much kill the ac­cep­tance of vac­ci­na­tion if it goes wrong, so I am very scep­ti­cal about what is go­ing on in Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>“I would be pleased if we had an ini­tial, good vac­cine, but based on ev­ery­thing we know – and that is the fun­da­men­tal prob­lem, namely that the Rus­sians aren’t telling us much.”</p>
    <p>He added it was cru­cial, even dur­ing a pan­demic, to carry out proper stud­ies and tests, and make the re­sults pub­lic to give peo­ple con­fi­dence in the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>“It is not about be­ing first some­how, it is about hav­ing an ef­fec­tive, tested and, there­fore, safe vac­cine,” he said when asked about Rus­sia’s vac­cine, which will be called “Sput­nik V”, in homage to the world’s first satel­lite launched by the Soviet Union.</p>
    <p>Only about 10 per cent of clin­i­cal tri­als are suc­cess­ful, and some sci­en­tists fear that Moscow may be putting na­tional pres­tige be­fore safety.</p>
    <p>But Mr Putin and other of­fi­cials have said the vac­cine, de­vel­oped by Ga­ma­leya In­sti­tute in Moscow, Rus­sia’s De­fence Min­istry and the sov­er­eign Rus­sian Direct In­vest­ment Fund, is com­pletely safe.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Mikhail Murashko said yes­ter­day: “West­ern col­leagues, who can sense the com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tage of the Rus­sian drug, are try­ing to ex­press some opin­ions that are com­pletely un­jus­ti­fied in our view.</p>
    <p>“This vac­cine is a plat­form that is al­ready well known and stud­ied.”</p>
    <p>He added that other coun­tries have de­vel­oped an­ti­dotes un­der ac­cel­er­ated test­ing pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>The Rus­sian au­thor­i­ties plan to start in­oc­u­lat­ing med­i­cal work­ers and other high-risk groups within two weeks on a vol­un­tary ba­sis, said Dr Murashko. The vac­cine will be avail­able to the wider pop­u­la­tion from Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus has killed nearly 750,000 peo­ple world­wide, in­fected more than 20 mil­lion and crip­pled na­tional economies.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies in­clud­ing As­traZeneca and Moderna are still con­duct­ing fi­nal-stage tri­als of their vac­cines i n stud­ies that are ex­pected to yield re­sults soon.</p>
    <p>The Rus­sian Direct In­vest­ment Fund said it will be able to pro­duce more than 500 mil­lion doses a year in five coun­tries. At least 20 na­tions, in­clud­ing the Philip­pines, are in­ter­ested in ob­tain­ing sup­plies, it added.</p>
    <p>Philip­pine Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte has lauded the Rus­sian vac­cine and of­fered to be “in­jected in pub­lic” to al­lay pub­lic fears about its safety.</p>
    <p>Philip­pine Health Un­der­sec­re­tary Maria Rosario Vergeire said the coun­try’s ex­perts will meet rep­re­sen­ta­tives of Ga­ma­leya In­sti­tute to dis­cuss tri­als and will re­quest a “com­plete dossier” on the vac­cine. “We will see if the al­le­ga­tions are true,” Dr Vergeire said, re­fer­ring to con­cerns that the vac­cine was ap­proved hastily.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines has among Asia’s high­est num­ber of Covid-19 cases, which rose to 143,749 yes­ter­day, two days af­ter hit­ting a daily record of 6,958 cases. A strict lock­down has been re-im­posed in and around the cap­i­tal Manila.</p>
