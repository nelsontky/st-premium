    <p>By his own ac­count, start-up founder An­ders Tan was a “chal­leng­ing” stu­dent in sec­ondary school.</p>
    <p>“I was in­volved in a lot of bad com­pany and ac­tiv­i­ties. I of­ten got into trou­ble with teach­ers,” the 35-yearold re­calls.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, his older cousin man­aged to keep him in check. Af­ter his N lev­els in 2002, Mr Tan scored a place in the then newly launched In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion (ITE) Nitec in Info-com­mu­ni­ca­tions Tech­nol­ogy course at the MacPher­son cam­pus.</p>
    <p>For the first time, he en­joyed study­ing and his grades im­proved markedly. He also started vol­un­teer­ing and was in­spired to set up a so­cial busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“At ITE, I met many peers who had grown up amid chal­leng­ing back­grounds, just like me. I wanted to do some­thing to help peo­ple who are caught in sit­u­a­tions they can’t break free from,” Mr Tan says.</p>
    <p>Tjo­huern­steayrt of a fruit­ful</p>
    <p>With his stel­lar ITE grades, Mr Tan pur­sued busi­ness in­for­mat­ics at Nanyang Polytech­nic. He even­tu­ally grad­u­ated with a Bach­e­lor of Science in in­for­ma­tion sys­tems man­age­ment from Singapore Man­age­ment Univer­sity (SMU).</p>
    <p>Mr Tan, who worked part-time as a tu­tor to help fund his stud­ies, says: “I never thought that I would en­ter univer­sity, much less get a de­gree, when I first started in ITE. How­ever, the grad­ual im­prove­ment in my stud­ies and pos­i­tive feed­back from the lec­tur­ers gave me the added push to want to do more. I be­gan to see some light at the end of the tun­nel and noth­ing was too dif­fi­cult or im­pos­si­ble to achieve any more.”</p>
    <p>In 2013, dur­ing his fi­nal year at SMU, he co-founded so­cial en­ter­prise EduS­nap, which em­ployed peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties (PWDs) as vir­tual tu­tors for needy stu­dents. The ex­pe­ri­ence work­ing with PWDs left a deep im­pres­sion on him.</p>
    <p>“I re­alised how ill-equipped our so­ci­ety and work­places are to sup­port the needs of PWDs.”</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing EduS­nap, Mr Tan started soft­ware devel­op­ment agency Bit Stu­dio. But he kept tabs on what lead­ing non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tions in other coun­tries were do­ing in the PWD space.</p>
    <p>In 2018, af­ter a year of con­cep­tu­al­i­sa­tion, he and a part­ner started In­clus, a so­cial busi­ness that helps young PWDs tran­si­tion to adult­hood with gain­ful em­ploy­ment and in­de­pen­dent liv­ing. In­clus, which is prof­itable, has 18 em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>Back to his roots</p>
    <p>De­ter­mined to give back to his alma mater, Mr Tan, who is mar­ried with one son, started vol­un­teer­ing for the ITE Alumni men­tor­ing pro­gramme in 2017. Two years later, he was se­lected to join the ITE Alumni man­age­ment com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>In­clus also hires ITE stu­dent in­terns and full-time em­ploy­ees un­der ITE’s Work-Study Diploma in Com­mu­nity En­gage­ment and Devel­op­ment course. “The course ob­jec­tives are an ex­act fit for our com­pany’s goals and needs. I am also in­ter­ested in stay­ing con­nected with young peo­ple and learn­ing from them, even while I’m also a men­tor to them,” Mr Tan ex­plains.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan’s ad­vice to ITE stu­dents is to pick a course that in­ter­ests them: “ITE pro­vides end­less op­por­tu­ni­ties that are noth­ing less than those at poly­tech­nics and uni­ver­si­ties.</p>
    <p>“We are all dealt dif­fer­ent cards at dif­fer­ent points in our lives. How you re­spond to var­i­ous chal­lenges de­fines who you are. As long as you have a strong be­lief that you can learn and ben­e­fit, re­gard­less of your sit­u­a­tion, you will even­tu­ally find suc­cess.”</p>
