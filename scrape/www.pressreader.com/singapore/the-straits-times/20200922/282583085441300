    <p>FIC­TION</p>
    <p>By Mieko Kawakami, trans­lated by Sam Bett and David Boyd Pi­cador/Pa­per­back/404 pages/ $29.95/Avail­able at bit.ly/BEg­gs_MK</p>
    <p>Cramped apart­ments with barely any win­dows; a stained tank top; ci­garette butts out­side the front door.</p>
    <p>The stain of poverty per­me­ates this novel by Mieko Kawakami, 44, who was a singer-song­writer and blog­ger be­fore she be­came known as a writer.</p>
    <p>In 2008, she won Ja­pan’s Aku­ta­gawa Prize for promis­ing new writ­ers of se­ri­ous fic­tion for her novella Breasts And Eggs, which has since been ex­panded into a novel and now trans­lated into English.</p>
    <p>Writer Nat­suko, her older sis­ter Makiko and the lat­ter’s daugh­ter Mi­doriko are at the cen­tre of this book, which looks at work­ing-class women.</p>
    <p>The sis­ters grew up in a tiny apart­ment in town near the ocean with a “lit­tle man” of a fa­ther and a mother who worked a few jobs a day.</p>
    <p>The girls later run away from their dead­beat and abusive fa­ther with their mum to join their ma­ter­nal granny in Osaka. But in two years, they lose their mother to breast can­cer and their grand­mother to lung can­cer.</p>
    <p>Makiko, who works as a bar host­ess, gets knocked up and be­comes a sin­gle mother like her mum be­fore her. Nat­suko, mean­while, grabs 10 of her favourite books and moves to Tokyo for her stud­ies, later be­com­ing a strug­gling writer.</p>
    <p>The first half of the story un­folds when Makiko, 39, and the teenage Mi­doriko travel to Osaka to visit Nat­suko, 30, one sum­mer.</p>
    <p>Makiko, who faces com­pe­ti­tion from young foreign ri­vals, is ob­sessed with the idea of breast en­large­ment, while Mi­doriko, who is grap­pling with pu­berty, finds it a strain to talk to her mum.</p>
    <p>Poverty and gen­der in­ter­sect in the case of Makiko and Nat­suko, who find them­selves ek­ing out paths starkly dif­fer­ent from that usu­ally taken by women in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>The story, told through Nat­suko, ex­plores the ways in which women rebel against so­cial norms in Ja­pan and the re­la­tion­ships be­tween sis­ters as well as mother and daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>The first half of the book cul­mi­nates in a sticky and messy scene as mother and daugh­ter crack un­der pres­sure.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond half, which is ex­panded from the novella, in­tro­duces more char­ac­ters and ex­am­ines the topic of chil­dren con­ceived through donor sperm and the en­su­ing eth­i­cal is­sues.</p>
    <p>Now 10 years older and still sin­gle, Nat­suko has achieved some suc­cess with a pub­lished book of short sto­ries. Some envy her free-an­deasy ex­is­tence as a writer, yet she won­ders if she is miss­ing out on life.</p>
    <p>She dreads the act of sex and toys with the idea of bring­ing life into the world us­ing donor sperm.</p>
    <p>But she reweighs her op­tions af­ter en­coun­ter­ing two in­di­vid­u­als, Aizawa and Yuriko, who are scarred from be­ing the off­spring of anony­mous donor dads. Hor­ri­ble scars in the case of Yuriko, who was sex­u­ally abused in her youth.</p>
    <p>Au­thor Kawakami dis­plays a deft satir­i­cal touch in a scene in which a pudgy man with a wart, who claims his sperm is in the top per­centile, of­fers to grease Nat­suko’s quest to be a mother, in­clud­ing the op­tion of “skin to skin” de­liv­ery of his sperm.</p>
    <p>The trans­la­tors have cap­tured the mu­si­cal­ity of Kawakami’s prose, though it is hard to dis­cern if they have man­aged to pre­serve the orig­i­nal’s Osaka di­alect.</p>
    <p>Leav­ened by some comic mo­ments, Breasts And Eggs is an am­bi­tious work that takes a good crack at in­ter­ro­gat­ing what makes a wo­man a wo­man and the pre­car­i­ous­ness of a wo­man’s ex­is­tence.</p>
    <p>If you like this, read: Con­ve­nience Store Wo­man by Sayaka Mu­rata (Granta Books, 2019, $17.95, avail­able at bit.ly/Con­vS­toreW_SM), which tells the story of a fe­male out­sider in Ja­pan. The pro­tag­o­nist is 36, sin­gle and de­voted to her job in a con­ve­nience store and the novel paints a fas­ci­nat­ing view of life in­side these ubiq­ui­tous places.</p>
