    <p>Muay Thai fighter Josh Tonna has com­peted in a packed arena of 70,000 cheer­ing and hoot­ing fans, but the big­gest fight of his ca­reer tonight will be fought in a silent sta­dium.</p>
    <p>The 31-year-old Aussie will chal­lenge for Thai star Sam-A Gaiyang­hadao’s strawweigh­t Muay Thai world ti­tle in the main event of One Cham­pi­onship’s Reign of Dy­nas­ties show at the Sin­ga­pore In­door Sta­dium.</p>
    <p>The event will be closed-door ow­ing to strict gov­ern­ment mea­sures to en­sure par­tic­i­pants’ safety amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Tonna ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore with his trainer and videog­ra­pher on Mon­day. Af­ter touch­ing down at Changi Air­port, they were whisked off – in sep­a­rate cars – to ShangriLa Ho­tel, where they have been quar­an­tined. Since then, they have been in al­most com­plete iso­la­tion in their own rooms.</p>
    <p>He is one of five fight­ers out of the 12 fea­tur­ing on the card who have flown in for the event. Overseas-based fight­ers will be tested for Covid-19 four times – be­fore they fly to Sin­ga­pore, upon ar­rival, be­fore and af­ter the fight – while oth­ers will be tested twice.</p>
    <p>One chief ex­ec­u­tive Cha­tri Si­ty­o­d­tong had ex­plained in an ear­lier me­dia con­fer­ence call that, as part of gov­ern­ment guide­lines spe­cific to the event, overseas-based ath­letes are not re­quired to un­dergo the manda­tory 14-day quar­an­tine or­der in place for reg­u­lar trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>On the eve of his big ti­tle fight, Tonna told The Straits Times in a phone in­ter­view that it has been a “very unique” fight week, un­like any of his 51 pre­vi­ous fights.</p>
    <p>“Leav­ing Can­berra and com­ing to Sin­ga­pore was a real ex­pe­ri­ence, with the swab tests, so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures and things like that,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Typ­i­cally, when we travel to­gether we’d all be in one room.</p>
    <p>“But this time, we were guided to our rooms and es­corted all around the ho­tel… Still, I com­pletely ap­pre­ci­ate all the mea­sures the One Cham­pi­onship staff and Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment have done to keep ev­ery­one safe and our in­dus­try go­ing.”</p>
    <p>Reign of Dy­nas­ties will mark the re­turn of live sport in Sin­ga­pore since the pan­demic oblit­er­ated the Re­pub­lic’s sports cal­en­dar.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board said on Wed­nes­day in a state­ment that it hoped this pi­lot project with mixed mar­tial arts (MMA) or­gan­i­sa­tion One on safe man­age­ment mea­sures “could pave the way for sports events to take place in the fu­ture”.</p>
    <p>These mea­sures in­clude cre­at­ing an event “bub­ble” where train­ing is al­lowed only at pri­vate des­ig­nated ar­eas within the ho­tel and fight­ers have to fol­low strict sched­ules.</p>
    <p>Tonna claims that this has not af­fected his prepa­ra­tion for his big bout, de­spite be­ing re­stricted to mostly shadow box­ing in iso­la­tion for the past week.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, vet­eran Thai fighter Sam-A is non­plussed by the un­usual na­ture of the lead-up to this fight. The Sin­ga­pore-based 36-year-old, who has won 369 of his 425 Muay Thai fights, has been stay­ing at the Shangri-La the past week, but told ST he has been able to train two hours daily.</p>
    <p>“Phys­i­cally, I am very well pre­pared and this is an im­por­tant fight for me be­cause it is the first de­fence of my strawweigh­t ti­tle,” he said. “Men­tally, it has also been good be­cause I like be­ing alone be­cause I am able to be more re­laxed be­fore the big day.”</p>
    <p>He did, how­ever, lament the ab­sence of fans on fight night. He had ex­pe­ri­enced this once when he cap­tured his ti­tle in Fe­bru­ary at One’s King of the Jun­gle event at the In­door Sta­dium.</p>
    <p>“It does af­fect us fight­ers a lit­tle bit,” con­ceded Sam-A. “Some­times in a fight when you need to sum­mon some­thing ex­tra and push, you need the fans but with­out hear­ing their voices and their cheers it is tough. But I al­ready passed the test in Fe­bru­ary, and I have to do it again on Fri­day.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter pur­chas­ing a med­i­ta­tion app to help him clear his mind,</p>
    <p>For the big­gest bout of his ca­reer, Aus­tralian fighter Josh Tonna will have no fans to cheer – or jeer – him. At tonight’s One Cham­pi­onship Reign of Dy­nas­ties event, he will chal­lenge for Sam-A Gaiyang­hadao’s strawweigh­t Muay Thai ti­tle be­hind closed doors.</p>
    <p>Tonna is fo­cused and ready for his dec­o­rated Thai ri­val.</p>
    <p>“This ti­tle fight is the big­gest op­por­tu­nity I could pos­si­bly have in Muay Thai, and to me it’s like the equiv­a­lent to the NBA Fi­nals or Olympic gold, so I’m re­ally hon­oured,” said Tonna. “I want to do well so I can be an am­bas­sador for the sport in Aus­tralia, bring One there, and in­spire our kids.”</p>
    <p>Reign of Dy­nas­ties will fea­ture six con­tests, in­clud­ing a light­weight MMA bout be­tween Sin­ga­porean Amir Khan and In­dia’s Rahul Raju.</p>
