    <p>The pan­demic is chang­ing as peo­ple in their 20s, 30s and 40s are in­creas­ingly driv­ing the spread of Covid-19 in­fec­tions in coun­tries in this re­gion that are see­ing a surge in cases.</p>
    <p>In Ja­pan, the Philip­pines and Aus­tralia’s state of Vic­to­ria, more than half the peo­ple in­fected are younger than 40 years old, said Dr Ta­mano Mat­sui, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s (WHO) Western Pa­cific Pro­gramme area man­ager for health emer­gency in­for­ma­tion and risk as­sess­ment. In fact, 65 per cent of peo­ple in­fected in Ja­pan last month and this month are 39 years old or younger.</p>
    <p>Dr Mat­sui added: “This is par­tic­u­larly con­cern­ing as these age groups are more likely to have mild or even no symp­toms.”</p>
    <p>Many of these younger peo­ple are un­aware that they have been in­fected and are spread­ing the disease, said Dr Takeshi Ka­sai, WHO’s re­gional di­rec­tor for the Western</p>
    <p>Pa­cific. “They’re in­fected with very mild symp­toms, or none at all. This can re­sult in them un­know­ingly pass­ing on the virus to oth­ers.”</p>
    <p>He said the higher num­ber of younger peo­ple test­ing pos­i­tive is due to sev­eral fac­tors. One is greater test­ing ca­pac­ity in these coun­tries. But an­other rea­son is that peo­ple in that age group might not see ob­vi­ous symp­toms that push them to get tested.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple in these younger age groups could “po­ten­tially be­come an im­por­tant driv­ing force of the pan­demic” if they have mild or no symp­toms, as most of them tend to be ac­tive.</p>
    <p>This in­creases the spread, driv­ing num­bers up. Dr Ka­sai added that this also “in­creases the risk of spillovers to the most vul­ner­a­ble: the el­derly, the sick, peo­ple in longterm care, peo­ple who live in densely pop­u­lated ur­ban ar­eas and un­der-served ru­ral ar­eas”.</p>
    <p>So it is im­por­tant for young peo­ple to pay at­ten­tion to any mild symp­toms they may have. “We must re­dou­ble ef­forts to stop the virus from moving into vul­ner­a­ble com­mu­ni­ties.”</p>
