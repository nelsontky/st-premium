    <p>Although the Covid-19 pan­demic has dom­i­nated head­lines in 2020, it is un­for­tu­nately not the only danger to public health that Sin­ga­pore and South-east Asia face this year. With the re­turn of the dry sea­son, there is a chance that trans­bound­ary haze re­leased by for­est and peat fires in In­done­sia might re­turn. Early ac­tion is needed to en­sure that the re­gion does not end up bat­tling health threats on mul­ti­ple fronts.</p>
    <p>The In­done­sian prov­inces of Cen­tral Kal­i­man­tan, Riau and South Su­ma­tra have al­ready de­clared states of emer­gency in re­sponse to ris­ing num­bers of hot spots, or pos­si­ble fires de­tected by satel­lites.</p>
    <p>This is a typ­i­cal pre­cau­tion­ary prac­tice at the start of the mid-year dry sea­son, and is not in it­self alarm­ing. Rather, it sig­nals that the pro­vin­cial au­thor­i­ties are in­creas­ing pa­trols and fire sup­pres­sion ef­forts, with the state of emer­gency al­low­ing them to re­quest help from the cen­tral govern­ment.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia has good rea­son to take the threat of haze se­ri­ously. Of­fi­cial fig­ures show that nearly 900,000 In­done­sians suf­fered from res­pi­ra­tory ail­ments at the height of last year’s haze, and the World Bank be­lieves that the crisis cost the coun­try some US$5.2 bil­lion (S$7.2 bil­lion), or 0.5 per cent of In­done­sia’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct.</p>
    <p>Typ­i­cally, the like­li­hood of haze de­pends on two fac­tors. One is how hot and dry the weather is likely to be. The other is hu­man ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>The haze-in­duc­ing fires in In­done­sia are thought to be largely man-made, the re­sult of fire be­ing used to clear land for agri­cul­ture. Govern­ment pol­icy, as well as ac­tion by both the au­thor­i­ties and pri­vate sec­tor, is there­fore crit­i­cal to the suc­cess of fire preven­tion and man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Based on the weather alone, we are not likely to see a ma­jor haze in­ci­dent like the one last year, when the re­gion suf­fered an un­usu­ally strong drought. Pro­jec­tions by the Asean Spe­cialised Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Cen­tre and other agen­cies sug­gest that the 2020 dry sea­son might be milder than av­er­age.</p>
    <p>This leaves the hu­man fac­tor. In­done­sia has taken steps to strengthen fire and haze preven­tion across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Since 2011, In­done­sia has stopped grant­ing new li­cences for com­pa­nies to con­vert pri­mary for­est and peat­land to agri­cul­tural use. This started off as a mora­to­rium in 2011, a tem­po­rary mea­sure that ended up be­ing pe­ri­od­i­cally ex­tended in two-year in­ter­vals.</p>
    <p>Last Au­gust, In­done­sian Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo made the ban per­ma­nent, a move that sig­nalled the na­tion’s con­tin­ued com­mit­ment to­wards safe­guard­ing the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Po­lice an­nounced ear­lier this month that 73 peo­ple and two com­pa­nies are cur­rently under in­ves­ti­ga­tion for set­ting fires since the start of the year.</p>
    <p>THE COVID-19 RISK FAC­TOR</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, 2020 is far from an or­di­nary year. De­spite ef­forts on the ground, the on­go­ing Covid-19 pan­demic raises the risk that fires might still burn out of con­trol.</p>
    <p>Fire and haze re­sponses have al­ready been hin­dered due to the health crisis.</p>
    <p>With govern­ment cof­fers under strain, In­done­sia’s Min­istry of En­vi­ron­ment and Forestry has had its bud­get re­duced, af­fect­ing its abil­ity to con­duct fire pa­trols. Pro­vin­cial and dis­trict gov­ern­ments have sim­i­larly had to di­vert fund­ing to hos­pi­tals, or to deal with job losses caused by the global eco­nomic slow­down.</p>
    <p>So­cial dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions have in­ter­rupted crit­i­cal fire preven­tion work, such as the con­struc­tion of in­fra­struc­ture to main­tain ground­wa­ter lev­els in fire-prone ar­eas. Face-to-face en­gage­ment ef­forts to ed­u­cate vil­lages and smaller com­pa­nies about the dan­gers of un­con­trolled burn­ing have also been dis­rupted.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, re­cent re­ports that the In­done­sian govern­ment may dis­solve the Peat­land Restora­tion Agency, or BRG, bear watch­ing. It is still too early to tell whether the BRG’s task of restor­ing some 2.67 mil­lion ha of peat­land will be smoothly car­ried over to other agen­cies, if it is dis­solved.</p>
    <p>More wor­ry­ingly, the eco­nomic slow­down caused by the pan­demic has also im­pacted liveli­hoods across In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>To some ex­tent, the weak com­modi­ties mar­ket is a dis­in­cen­tive for grow­ers to clear land and ex­pand plan­ta­tions. But In­done­sia’s agri­cul­tural sec­tor has nu­mer­ous mid-sized and smaller grow­ers that have low mar­gins and lean bal­ance sheets. Such plan­ta­tion op­er­a­tors may feel pres­sure to keep plant­ing de­spite the slug­gish mar­ket, and some may re­sort to the use of fire as a cost-sav­ing mea­sure.</p>
    <p>WHAT SIN­GA­PORE, ASEAN CAN DO</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of In­ter­na­tional Af­fairs re­leased its an­nual Haze Out­look re­port last month, warn­ing that a se­vere trans­bound­ary haze re­mains a risk – rated am­ber on a scale of green, am­ber and red – be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Within In­done­sia, govern­ment agen­cies and non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions have also sounded the alarm. The au­thor­i­ties have al­ready car­ried out cloud-seed­ing op­er­a­tions to in­duce rain in fire-prone re­gions.</p>
    <p>Me­dia re­ports also say Mr Joko told a special Cabi­net meet­ing that In­done­sia must not for­get the ur­gent need to deal with for­est and land fires, even though the na­tion is busy fight­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But the haze is not merely a na­tional-level prob­lem. Other coun­tries in the re­gion also have roles to play in ad­dress­ing the is­sue.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is a key part of agribusi­ness sup­ply chains, and sev­eral lead­ing firms in the sec­tor are based in Sin­ga­pore. As a re­gional hub, Sin­ga­pore can use trade, fi­nan­cial and con­sumer levers to en­cour­age sus­tain­able in­dus­try prac­tices.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tion­ally, Asean has set a goal of achiev­ing a haze-free re­gion by this year. Asean should con­tinue strength­en­ing its plat­forms for mem­ber states to co­or­di­nate ac­tion to tackle trans­bound­ary haze and im­prove sus­tain­abil­ity stan­dards.</p>
    <p>The link be­tween Covid-19 and the risk of haze il­lus­trates how the pan­demic can have sig­nif­i­cant knock-on ef­fects be­yond the mor­tal­ity rate of the virus it­self.</p>
    <p>If a haze crisis oc­curs while the re­gion and world are still fight­ing the pan­demic, it would com­pound the strain on public health re­sources.</p>
    <p>By ad­dress­ing the risk of haze and fires with early in­ter­ven­tion and con­tin­ued vig­i­lance, we can en­sure that the lat­ter half of this year does not see mul­ti­ple health threats en­dan­ger­ing the public all at once, po­ten­tially push­ing re­sources to break­ing point.</p>

        <p data-role="text">A coastal area of Jakarta shrouded in thick haze last month. If a haze crisis oc&#xAD;curs while South-east Asia and the world are still fight&#xAD;ing the pan&#xAD;demic, it would com&#xAD;pound the strain on public health re&#xAD;sources, the writ&#xAD;ers say, stress&#xAD;ing the need to ad&#xAD;dress the risk of haze and fires with early in&#xAD;ter&#xAD;ven&#xAD;tion and con&#xAD;tin&#xAD;ued vig&#xAD;i&#xAD;lance.</p>
