    <p>BEI­JING • Main­land China has barred en­try to non-Chi­nese vis­i­tors from Bri­tain, Bel­gium and the Philip­pines and de­manded that trav­ellers from the US, France and Ger­many present re­sults of ad­di­tional health tests, as coro­n­avirus cases rise around the world.</p>
    <p>China has tem­po­rar­ily sus­pended en­try of non-Chi­nese na­tion­als trav­el­ling from Bri­tain even if they hold valid visas and res­i­dence per­mits, the Chi­nese em­bassy in Bri­tain said yes­ter­day, in some of the most strin­gent bor­der re­stric­tions im­posed by any coun­try in re­sponse to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese em­bassies in Bel­gium and the Philip­pines re­leased sim­i­lar state­ments an­nounc­ing re­stric­tions on trav­ellers from the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“We are con­cerned by the abrupt­ness of the an­nounce­ment and the blan­ket ban on en­try, and await fur­ther clar­i­fi­ca­tion on when it will be lifted,” said the Bri­tish Cham­ber of Com­merce in China.</p>
    <p>The re­jec­tion of non-Chi­nese trav­ellers from Bri­tain came as Eng­land en­tered a month-long lock­down, which stated yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s death toll from Covid-19 is the high­est in Europe and it is grap­pling with more than 20,000 new coro­n­avirus cases a day.</p>
    <p>Bel­gium has Europe’s high­est per-capita num­ber of new con­firmed cases, while the Philip­pines has the sec­ond-high­est num­ber of in­fec­tions and deaths in South­east Asia, af­ter In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>The sus­pen­sion was a par­tial re­ver­sal of an eas­ing on Sept 28, when China al­lowed all for­eign­ers with valid res­i­dence per­mits to en­ter. In March, China had banned en­try of for­eign­ers in re­sponse to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>From today, all pas­sen­gers from the United States, France, Ger­many and Thai­land bound for main­land China must take both a nu­cleic acid test and a blood test for an­ti­bod­ies against the coro­n­avirus. The tests must be done no more than 48 hours be­fore board­ing, the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties said.</p>
    <p>If the pas­sen­ger needs to make a tran­sit stop en route to China, the same tests must be done in the tran­sit coun­try or re­gion.</p>
    <p>Ms Linyi Li, a Chi­nese na­tional, had planned to fly from Seat­tle to China in the mid­dle of this month but switched her flight to today to cir­cum­vent the rule, even though fares had tripled. “The tick­ets were sold out in sec­onds, as peo­ple were all scram­bling to beat the dead­line,” said Ms Li, 30.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar re­quire­ments have been im­posed on trav­ellers from coun­tries such as Aus­tralia, Sin­ga­pore and Ja­pan, start­ing from Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The dual-testing rule is not un­prece­dented. Pas­sen­gers ar­riv­ing on spe­cially ar­ranged flights from coun­tries like In­dia can un­dergo sev­eral rounds of those tests.</p>
    <p>“Un­for­tu­nately, while tech­ni­cally leav­ing the door open, these changes im­ply a de facto ban on any­one try­ing to get back to their lives, work and fam­i­lies in China,” said the European Union Cham­ber of Com­merce in China.</p>
    <p>The cham­ber also said the an­ti­body test was not widely avail­able in many coun­tries.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, China South­ern Air­lines, the coun­try’s big­gest car­rier by pas­sen­ger load, said it would sus­pend tran­sit ser­vices for pas­sen­gers em­bark­ing from 21 coun­tries, mostly African and Asian coun­tries such as In­dia and the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>From today, all pas­sen­gers from the United States, France, Ger­many and Thai­land bound for main­land China must take both a nu­cleic acid test and a blood test for an­ti­bod­ies against the coro­n­avirus. The tests must be done no more than 48 hours be­fore board­ing.</p>
