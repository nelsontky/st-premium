    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Health ex­perts have de­ter­mined that face cov­er­ings are a vi­tal tool in re­duc­ing the spread of the coro­n­avirus – but lit­tle re­search has been done into how dif­fer­ent kinds of masks com­pare.</p>
    <p>A new study has ranked 14 types of com­monly avail­able masks, find­ing that med­i­cal masks of­fer sig­nif­i­cantly more pro­tec­tion against droplet spread than cot­ton al­ter­na­tives – while ban­danas and bal­a­clavas do not do much at all.</p>
    <p>The find­ings have public pol­icy im­pli­ca­tions, par­tic­u­larly in the United States where the au­thor­i­ties have en­cour­aged the public to use tex­tile masks and leave the med­i­cal prod­ucts to health­care work­ers be­cause they are in short sup­ply.</p>
    <p>“We need to scale up sur­gi­cal mask pro­duc­tion and dis­tri­bu­tion,” tweeted Dr Tom Frieden, for­mer di­rec­tor of the Cen­tres for Disease Con­trol and Preven­tion un­der then Pres­i­dent Barack Obama, in re­sponse to the study that ap­peared in Sci­ence Ad­vances.</p>
    <p>Masks are i mpor­tant be­cause some 30 per cent to 40 per cent of peo­ple who are in­fected may not show symp­toms but still un­wit­tingly spread the virus when they cough, sneeze or just talk.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists at Duke Univer­sity cre­ated an in­ex­pen­sive set-up: Peo­ple stood in a dark room and spoke the words “Stay healthy, peo­ple” five times into the di­rec­tion of an ex­panded laser beam, which was recorded with a cell­phone cam­era.</p>
    <p>A com­puter al­go­rithm was then used to cal­cu­late the num­ber of droplets. The laser and lens can be bought for US$200 (S$275) and the ex­per­i­men­tal de­sign is easy to repli­cate by non-ex­perts.</p>
    <p>“This sort of test could eas­ily be con­ducted by busi­nesses and oth­ers that are pro­vid­ing masks to their em­ploy­ees or pa­trons,” said the study’s co-au­thor Martin Fis­cher, a chemist and physi­cist.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sion­ally fit­ted N95 masks – hos­pi­tal-grade pro­tec­tion worn by front-line work­ers in hos­pi­tals – re­duced droplet trans­mis­sion to less than 0.1 per cent.</p>
    <p>Sur­gi­cal or polypropy­lene masks were not far be­hind, cut­ting droplet trans­mis­sion by 90 per cent or more com­pared with no face cov­er­ings.</p>
    <p>Hand­made cot­ton face cov­er­ings pro­vided good cov­er­age, elim­i­nat­ing 70 per cent to 90 per cent of the spray from nor­mal speech, de­pend­ing on the num­ber of lay­ers and pleat­ing.</p>
    <p>But ban­danas re­duced the droplets by only about 50 per cent and neck fleeces ac­tu­ally in­creased the amount of spray, prob­a­bly by dispersing the largest droplets into many smaller droplets.</p>
    <p>N95 masks with valves – de­signed for in­dus­trial set­tings where the user’s ex­ha­la­tion was less im­por­tant than what they in­haled – per­formed roughly on a par with cot­ton masks in terms of the amount of spray trans­mit­ted. The health au­thor­i­ties have dis­cour­aged the use of valved N95 masks.</p>
    <p>Co-au­thor Eric West­man said he had al­ready put the in­for­ma­tion to use, avoid­ing the bulk pur­chase of a type of mask he and a lo­cal non­profit group had planned to dis­trib­ute to the public in Durham, North Carolina, where the univer­sity is based. “The no­tion that ‘any­thing is bet­ter than noth­ing’ didn’t hold true,” he said.</p>
