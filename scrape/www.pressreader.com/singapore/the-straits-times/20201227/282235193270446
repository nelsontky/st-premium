    <p>When Mr Al­van Koh be­gan tin­ker­ing with the hand tools and spare wood ly­ing around the house about six years ago, he wanted to make a wooden box for his wife.</p>
    <p>It was meant for her to keep her el­ven neck­lace, a piece in­spired by the fan­tasy novel and film se­ries The Lord Of The Rings.</p>
    <p>Lit­tle did he know it would spark an en­dur­ing pas­sion for car­pen­try and he would end up start­ing a hand­made fur­ni­ture label.</p>
    <p>The 41-year-old says: “It turned into a hobby that I found my­self putting more and more hours into. One day, I thought, ‘If I’m hav­ing so much fun do­ing this, why not make it my pro­fes­sion?’”</p>
    <p>So, he started Mokko Wood Stu­dio in 2018. It was not easy go­ing pro, says Mr Koh, whose pre­vi­ous jobs in­clude work­ing at a bank and be­ing an English teacher. He was a pri­vate-hire driver when he ven­tured into car­pen­try full time.</p>
    <p>He re­calls: “Any YouTube video on car­pen­try, I had prob­a­bly seen it a few times. What­ever I watched at night, I would put into prac­tice the next day, so I im­proved very quickly in the be­gin­ning. But I plateaued in my self-learn­ing jour­ney af­ter a few years and re­alised I needed some­one to teach me.”</p>
    <p>But there were no suit­able lessons for car­pen­try here, let alone Ja­panese wood­work­ing, which in­ter­ested Mr Koh.</p>
    <p>De­spite not speak­ing Ja­panese, he sourced for ap­pren­tice­ships in Ja­pan by send­ing e-mail mes­sages to car­pen­ters there, but he had lit­tle luck ini­tially. Then, one of the Ja­panese car­pen­ters he ap­proached started a one-month course con­ducted in English in Ky­oto.</p>
    <p>With his wife’s sup­port, the fa­ther of two chil­dren aged eight and nine moved to Ky­oto for a month in 2018 to hone his skills un­der a tem­ple builder.</p>
    <p>He says of mak­ing the jump to be­com­ing a pro­fes­sional car­pen­ter: “I had doubts, like ‘Am I good enough?’ or ‘Is this even vi­able?’.</p>
    <p>“Go­ing to Ja­pan gave me con­fi­dence as my mas­ter en­cour­aged me. By then, I also had friends and fam­ily mem­bers ask­ing me to make small pieces of fur­ni­ture for them, such as cab­i­nets, shelves and boxes. If peo­ple were ask­ing for my work, then I must be good enough.”</p>
    <p>Mr Koh says he used a five-fig­ure sum from his sav­ings to fund his trip to Ja­pan and buy tools for his car­pen­try ven­ture.</p>
    <p>He runs his stu­dio out of a rented space in Tampines, where the bulk of his time is spent craft­ing be­spoke fur­ni­ture pieces. He of­ten uses ex­pen­sive Euro­pean wood such as walnut, oak and maple.</p>
    <p>As all his pieces are hand­crafted, he can take on a max­i­mum of only three com­mis­sions a month. Prices for his side­boards start at $4,000, while ta­bles start at $3,500 and cof­fee ta­bles start at $1,500.</p>
    <p>The self-con­fessed per­fec­tion­ist has never made a piece of fur­ni­ture for him­self, though.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter I make some­thing,</p>
    <p>I</p>
    <p>al­ways think what I could have done better,” he says. “I want the per­fect piece for my­self, but no piece is per­fect to me yet.”</p>
    <p>He also runs a monthly wood­work­ing course and one-off coaster-mak­ing ses­sions us­ing the Ja­panese ku­miko wood­work­ing tech­nique.</p>
    <p>“This was a prom­ise I made to my­self in Ja­pan. When I wanted to learn from some­one here, I could not find any­one. But there must be peo­ple out there with sim­i­lar in­ter­ests, so I wanted to pro­vide a plat­form to teach oth­ers,” he says.</p>
    <p>Learn­ing is a jour­ney that will</p>
    <p>not end for Mr Koh, whose ex­per­tise is in cab­i­netry. Last year, he took a short course taught by a fel­low car­pen­ter who spe­cialises in mak­ing chairs.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic, he had plans this year to re­turn to Ja­pan to visit his mas­ter and hone his plan­ing skill – to take the thinnest pos­si­ble shav­ing from a block of wood – for a car­pen­try com­pe­ti­tion there.</p>
    <p>He adds: “The learn­ing never stops. I think that’s a phi­los­o­phy tied to the shokunin (Ja­panese for crafts­man) spirit – we are never a fin­ished prod­uct.”</p>
