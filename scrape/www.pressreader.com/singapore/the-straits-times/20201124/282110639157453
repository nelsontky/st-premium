    <p>Six­teen-year-old Jayne Peh Hin Peng has been writ­ing songs since she was 11, but it was only this year that she started pen­ning Chi­nese songs, in­spired by an im­mer­sion trip to China at the end of last year.</p>
    <p>Even though she was new to this, two of her Chi­nese songs made the win­ning list at this year’s “Xin Kong Xia” Na­tional Schools Xinyao Song­writ­ing Com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>The com­pe­ti­tion aims to pro­mote aware­ness and ap­pre­ci­a­tion of xinyao – a term that refers to lo­cal Chi­nese mu­sic cul­ture – as well as ig­nite stu­dents’ love for learn­ing the Chi­nese lan­guage through com­pos­ing Chi­nese songs.</p>
    <p>This year, 336 stu­dents from 60 schools sub­mit­ted 267 en­tries, the high­est num­ber of en­tries re­ceived in six years of the com­pe­ti­tion. This was in part due to a new cat­e­gory in which par­tic­i­pants could sub­mit lyrics to an al­ready-com­posed tune.</p>
    <p>The en­tries were judged by a panel made up of mu­sic in­dus­try veter­ans, with the re­sults an­nounced at a hy­brid on-site and vir­tual award cer­e­mony yes­ter­day that was streamed live.</p>
    <p>The guest of hon­our was Ms Sun Xuel­ing, Min­is­ter of State for Ed­u­ca­tion as well as So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Ms Sun, who also chairs the Com­mit­tee to Pro­mote Chi­nese Lan­guage Learn­ing (CP­CLL), an­nounced the cham­pion of each of the three com­pe­ti­tion cat­e­gories.</p>
    <p>Jayne won first place in the Song­writ­ing (Cre­ative) Cat­e­gory, in which stu­dents wrote songs draw­ing in­spi­ra­tion from their Chi­nese text­books.</p>
    <p>The Nanyang Girls’ High School Sec 4 stu­dent also placed third in the Song­writ­ing (Open) Cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>As a first-time par­tic­i­pant, Jayne said she felt mo­ti­vated to im­prove her stan­dard of Chi­nese.</p>
    <p>She added: “I am look­ing at my fel­low com­peti­tors and I am in awe of their grasp of the lan­guage.”</p>
    <p>Like Jayne, the cham­pi­ons in the other two cat­e­gories are first-time par­tic­i­pants in the com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim Kian Hui, 25, a fi­nal-year chem­i­cal en­gi­neer­ing stu­dent at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, was the win­ner in the Song­writ­ing (Open) Cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>CHIJ St Ni­cholas Girls’ School Sec 2 stu­dent Zhou Yun Qing, 14, was the win­ner in the Lyrics Writ­ing Cat­e­gory, in which stu­dents penned lyrics to a tune com­posed by lo­cal com­poser and singer Li Fey Huei, who was one of the eight judges.</p>
    <p>Prizes were given this year to 22 stu­dents. The com­pe­ti­tion was coor­gan­ised by the CP­CLL, Jurong Pi­o­neer Ju­nior Col­lege, Lianhe Zaobao and TCR Mu­sic Sta­tion.</p>
