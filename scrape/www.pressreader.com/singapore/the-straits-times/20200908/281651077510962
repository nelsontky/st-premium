    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s con­sumer pro­tec­tion laws may soon have more teeth, with the Gov­ern­ment look­ing into strengthen­ing the en­force­ment pow­ers of the Com­pe­ti­tion and Con­sumer Com­mis­sion of Sin­ga­pore (CCCS).</p>
    <p>CCCS’ as­sis­tant chief ex­ec­u­tive of le­gal, en­force­ment and con­sumer pro­tec­tion Lee Cheow Han said yes­ter­day that this could en­tail em­pow­er­ing the com­mis­sion to is­sue fines for breaches of con­sumer pro­tec­tion laws with­out hav­ing to go through the courts.</p>
    <p>While the CCCS can cur­rently is­sue such penal­ties to firms for in­fringe­ments of the Com­pe­ti­tion Act, it is un­able to do so in its con­sumer pro­tec­tion role.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to a ques­tion at a me­dia con­fer­ence, Mr Lee said there is scope for the CCCS to re­view its ad­min­is­tra­tion of the Con­sumer Pro­tec­tion (Fair Trad­ing) Act, and “per­haps take a look at hav­ing some ad­di­tional statu­tory pow­ers, so that there can be bet­ter and more ef­fec­tive en­force­ment of the Act”.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Act, the CCCS can in­ves­ti­gate er­rant busi­nesses and file an in­junc­tion ap­pli­ca­tion to or­der them to cease an un­fair prac­tice. If these busi­nesses per­sist, they can be charged with con­tempt of court, which car­ries a fine of up to $10,000 and up to a year in jail.</p>
    <p>But this can be a lengthy and in­ef­fec­tual process.</p>
    <p>The com­mis­sion has been awarded two in­junc­tion or­ders since it took over the ad­min­is­tra­tion of the Act from Spring Sin­ga­pore in 2018.</p>
    <p>The first – against a car im­porter – took 16 months to be granted af­ter the now-de­funct Spring had ap­plied for it. The sec­ond, against an on­line re­tailer, was granted in two months.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers have said that Sin­ga­pore’s con­sumer pro­tec­tion laws and en­force­ment pow­ers need to be beefed up to be more ef­fec­tive. They noted that the coun­try lags be­hind oth­ers like Aus­tralia, where breaches of con­sumer pro­tec­tion laws can in­cur hefty fines on a par with penal­ties for anti-com­pet­i­tive con­duct.</p>
    <p>Ms Sia Aik Kor, CCCS’s chief ex­ec­u­tive, said the re­view is on­go­ing and more de­tails will be an­nounced later.</p>
