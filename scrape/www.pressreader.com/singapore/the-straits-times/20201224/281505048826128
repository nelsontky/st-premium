    <p>There will be no fire­works at this year’s Ma­rina Bay New Year’s Eve count­down but Sin­ga­pore­ans can still catch them at 11 lo­ca­tions in the heart­land to usher in 2021.</p>
    <p>Part of year-end events or­gan­ised by the Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion (PA), fire­works dis­plays will take place in Hous­ing Board towns like Be­dok, Tampines, Bis­han and Yew Tee, and be live-streamed on the Facebook pages of the con­stituen­cies.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, PA said the vir­tual pro­grammes bring year-end fes­tiv­i­ties to fam­i­lies “in a safe way”, al­low­ing ev­ery­one to en­joy the pro­grammes in the com­fort of their homes.</p>
    <p>“As 2020 comes to a close and we ap­proach phase three of re­open­ing, we need to re­main vig­i­lant par­tic­u­larly dur­ing festive pe­ri­ods,” said the as­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Two of the year-end vir­tual pro­grammes are tak­ing place this Sun­day. An­other 12 will be held on New Year’s Eve, and the re­main­ing two on New Year’s Day.</p>
    <p>High­lights in­clude Mar­sil­ingYew Tee GRC’s Vir­tual Count­down 2021 on Dec 31 from 10.30pm, fea­tur­ing lo­cal artistes like Sezairi, MICap­pella, TheLionCi­tyBoy and The Lorong Boys.</p>
    <p>Those liv­ing in Cle­menti can ring in 2021 with a work­out on Jan 1 dur­ing the con­stituency’s sport­s­themed morn­ing pro­gramme that starts at 9am. The af­ter­noon seg­ment, start­ing at 2pm, fea­tures lo­cal singers and bands.</p>
    <p>Be­sides Be­dok, Tampines, Bis­han and Yew Tee, the seven other HDB towns with dis­plays of fire­works are: Boon Lay, Gey­lang, Hougang, Jurong, the Nanyang ward in West Coast GRC, Tiong Bahru and Wood­lands.</p>
    <p>PA did not pro­vide spe­cific van­tage points to watch the fire­works as res­i­dents are en­cour­aged to do so from home since the dis­plays will be live-streamed.</p>
    <p>A PA spokesman said safe man­age­ment mea­sures will be in place at dis­play sites to en­sure pub­lic safety.</p>
    <p>“We are work­ing with rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties and will be de­ploy­ing safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors to re­mind res­i­dents not to gather and to en­sure safety at the re­spec­tive sites,” he said.</p>
    <p>Yew Tee res­i­dent Chan Cui Si, who is in her 50s, said that, if pos­si­ble, she would try to catch the dis­play from her flat.</p>
    <p>“With­out know­ing where the fo­cal point of the dis­play is, leav­ing the house might be fu­tile,” said the house­wife, who added that an open area in the neigh­bour­hood was crowded dur­ing a sim­i­lar event on Na­tional Day, mak­ing the view­ing ex­pe­ri­ence an un­pleas­ant one.</p>
    <p>Those hop­ing to revel in New Year fes­tiv­i­ties in the city can head to Ma­rina Bay for two light shows, one of which has been go­ing on since the be­gin­ning of the month. De­tails are avail­able at marin­abay count­down.gov.sg</p>
