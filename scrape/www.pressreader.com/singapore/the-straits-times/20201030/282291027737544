    <p>An in­ci­dent in­volv­ing a large ceil­ing fan in­jured two cus­tomers at a cof­fee shop in Tampines on Wed­nes­day night.</p>
    <p>The in­jured pa­trons are un­der­stood to be a young man and an el­derly woman who were seated at the same ta­ble.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force said it re­ceived a call for as­sis­tance at Block 201D Tampines Street 21 at about 7.10pm on Wed­nes­day. The 20-year-old man and 82-year-old woman were taken con­scious to Changi Gen­eral Hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>The cof­fee shop’s owner, Mr K.B. Soh, told The Straits Times that the fan had un­der­gone yearly main­te­nance works ear­lier on Wed­nes­day. In the 10 years since the fan and an­other had been in­stalled in the cof­fee shop, there had been no prior in­ci­dents in­volv­ing them, said Mr Soh.</p>
    <p>After the works were com­pleted, the fan was switched on and a ser­vice­man on site tried to move a lad­der be­low the fan.</p>
    <p>This caused the fan’s blades to hit the lad­der, which re­sulted in part of a blade break­ing off.</p>
    <p>There are con­flict­ing ac­counts on what hap­pened next but the in­ci­dent caused two cof­fee shop pa­trons to be in­jured.</p>
    <p>Photos posted on­line show one of the pa­trons, the young man, clutch­ing the back of his head, which ap­peared to be bleed­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Soh said that the man’s head was in­jured while the other cus­tomer, the el­derly woman, had arm in­juries.</p>
    <p>While many cus­tomers ran from the scene when the in­ci­dent hap­pened, some tried to help the in­jured duo, re­ported Chi­nese-lan­guage pa­per Shin Min Daily News.</p>
    <p>One of them was med­i­cal doc­tor Lee Shi Zhong who ban­daged the man’s wound. He said the man had a 3cm-long wound on his head.</p>
    <p>Dr Lee said that the el­derly woman’s arm was bleed­ing too, but her in­jury ap­peared to be su­per­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>Mr Soh said he was in con­tact with the cof­fee shop’s in­sur­ance com­pany and the two pa­trons to try to help the lat­ter.</p>
    <p>“This is the first time some­thing like this has hap­pened in my 36 years of run­ning this cof­fee shop,” said Mr Soh.</p>
    <p>“It’s like be­ing a fa­ther who ac­ci­den­tally hit his child while driv­ing. I never thought some­thing like this would hap­pen.”</p>
