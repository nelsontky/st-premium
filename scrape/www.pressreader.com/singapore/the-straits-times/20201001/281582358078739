    <p>Valu­ing time is of­ten used in trans­port stud­ies to gauge how much com­muters value con­ges­tion-free travel. It can be ex­tended to study­ing the eco­nomic im­pact of Covid-19 as peo­ple spend more time work­ing from home and on house­hold ac­tiv­i­ties, says Pro­fes­sor Eus­ton Quah.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has raised in­ter­est­ing ques­tions on the value of time. Time spent at home ver­sus time spent in the of­fice; time spent trav­el­ling to work; leisure and recre­ation time; time spent in treat­ment and hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion; time spent on vol­un­teer work; and time in lock­down.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mists are of­ten called upon to value time for such pur­poses as in es­ti­mat­ing the costs of traf­fic con­ges­tion, time sav­ings in trans­porta­tion projects, pro­duc­tiv­ity gains from time sav­ings, and as part of valu­ing the bene­fits of avert­ing dis­eases or ill­nesses; and, last but not least, in mea­sur­ing non-mar­ket pro­duc­tive ac­tiv­i­ties such as vol­un­teer work and house­hold pro­duc­tion, which should, but do not, count to­wards gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP).</p>
    <p>Time has eco­nomic value just like any mar­ket com­mod­ity, and mea­sur­ing and valu­ing time for all its dif­fer­ent users is not just a cu­rios­ity but ac­tu­ally a ne­ces­sity.</p>
    <p>WORK­ING TIME</p>
    <p>Dur­ing this pan­demic, many work­ers spend more time work­ing from home than in the of­fice. This work­ing ar­range­ment, which is likely to be the new nor­mal af­ter the pan­demic is over, calls into ques­tion whether pro­duc­tiv­ity can be main­tained or even raised from work­ing at home vis-a-vis of­fice time. So what is the value of work­ing time?</p>
    <p>Es­ti­ma­tion of the value of work­ing time is rela­tively easy. Con­ven­tion­ally, this will be in­di­cated by the wage rates earned. Em­ploy­ers hire labour as long as the value added to the ad­di­tional out­put by the last worker hired is higher than the wage rate paid to this worker (or when mar­ginal labour cost is lower than mar­ginal out­put). This hir­ing will stop when the last worker hired adds value just equal to the wage rate paid. Em­ploy­ers would not want to in­cur higher costs with more work­ers if the mar­ket value they bring in to the firm is less than the wage costs.</p>
    <p>Thus, whether the em­ployee works at home or in the of­fice does not mat­ter. The same value is as­cribed to the op­por­tu­nity cost of time which is the wage rate. Lim­i­ta­tions of this ap­proach, how­ever, in­clude rigidi­ties in the lump-sum amount of work­ing time – eight-hour day or 40-hour week – mak­ing it dif­fi­cult to know how much an hour of time is worth since work­ers can­not of­ten choose the num­ber of hours they wish to work.</p>
    <p>The value of time to the in­di­vid­ual and the value of time to the em­ployer would also likely be dif­fer­ent. This is be­cause to the em­ployer, labour is only one com­po­nent cost to to­tal cost (cap­i­tal costs, non-wage costs and so on) whereas the in­di­vid­ual will also con­sider house­hold pro­duc­tion and leisure val­ues.</p>
    <p>It is also the case that for the em­ployer, labour needs to com­ple­ment such things as cap­i­tal, dis­ci­plines of a work­place, and some in­tan­gi­bles in­clud­ing so­cial in­ter­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>NON-WORK­ING TIME</p>
    <p>An em­ployee’s non-work­ing time com­prises time spent on house­hold work and time spent en­joy­ing recre­ation and leisure.</p>
    <p>In the same way as we es­ti­mate the value of work­ing time, the value of non-work­ing time must be equal to what a per­son for­goes by way of earn­ings from putting that time to mar­ket work.</p>
    <p>If this for­gone wage or in­come rises, or if disu­til­ity of non-work time in­creases, then the amount of time spent at home will be re­duced.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, non-work­ing time will in­crease if wage rates fall from work­ing time or if work at the of­fice be­comes more un­plea­sur­able.</p>
    <p>Time is thus mea­sur­able, can be val­ued and ex­changed. And if one does not have enough time to do ev­ery­thing one wants, then one can also buy some­one else’s time. For ex­am­ple, we hire babysit­ters and do­mes­tic work­ers to do child-mind­ing and house­keep­ing, and free up our time for en­gage­ments in other ac­tiv­i­ties. The value of time is de­rived from how much we value what that time could be used for.</p>
    <p>How­ever, this trade-off ap­proach of mea­sur­ing time has draw­backs be­cause it fails to take ac­count of the fact that time val­ues are of­ten sit­u­a­tion-spe­cific.</p>
    <p>TRAV­EL­LING TIME</p>
    <p>Take the case of trans­porta­tion stud­ies in­volv­ing travel-time sav­ings. Re­search into the eco­nomic value of time in trans­port stud­ies has focused on two main ar­eas: re­duc­ing con­ges­tion and im­prove­ments in trans­port links and net­works.</p>
    <p>Sav­ings in com­muters’ time could be es­ti­mated by their wage rates. This is par­tic­u­larly rel­e­vant for sales­peo­ple, as sav­ing trav­el­ling time means they could earn more. Fixed-in­come earn­ers, such as salaried em­ploy­ees, may value their sav­ings in trav­el­ling time dif­fer­ently from their wage rates, and some stud­ies have in­di­cated this value to be be­tween one-quar­ter and half of their wage rates. This op­por­tu­nity cost of time mea­sure is thus one ap­proach to valu­ing trav­el­ling time.</p>
    <p>An­other way is to ob­serve how peo­ple make choices in trans­port op­tions in their com­par­i­son be­tween cost and speed or sav­ings in trav­el­ling time. Those who choose a higher speed mode of trans­port save time but have to in­cur a higher cost. The ad­di­tional cost pro­vides an in­di­ca­tion of the value of trav­el­ling time. This method, known as the trade-off ap­proach, can be ap­plied in pub­lic ver­sus pri­vate trans­port choices.</p>
    <p>Yet an­other ap­proach to valu­ing travel time is to ask com­muters about their will­ing­ness to pay for cer­tain op­tions. This non-mar­ket-con­tin­gent val­u­a­tion method elic­its this value of sav­ings in time by es­ti­mat­ing how much con­sumers would be pre­pared to pay for free­ing up some trav­el­ling time.</p>
    <p>Last but not least is to value such sav­ings in time by ref­er­ence to real es­tate val­ues. One rea­son why some prop­er­ties com­mand a higher price is their prox­im­ity to down­town or to some other well-known place. This dif­fer­en­tial prop­erty price can be de­duced from re­gres­sion stud­ies and used as the value of com­mut­ing time.</p>
    <p>RECRE­ATIONAL AND LEISURE TIME</p>
    <p>Dur­ing much of Sin­ga­pore’s cir­cuit breaker pe­riod when of­fices and re­tail shops were mostly closed, many res­i­dents re­sorted to spend­ing recre­ational time in neigh­bour­hood parks. Un­like nor­mal times when res­i­dents are not re­stricted in their choice of ac­tiv­i­ties, the value of recre­ational time dur­ing this re­stricted pe­riod must be lower than the un­re­stricted pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Thus the value of recre­ational time must be equal to what peo­ple can do with their time not spent in recre­ation; and this value can be the for­gone op­por­tu­ni­ties for mar­ket work and/or time de­voted to house­work.</p>
    <p>And, be­cause this recre­ational time takes place out­side mar­ket work time, then the op­por­tu­nity cost must be based on time val­ued for leisure and not that of work time. Stud­ies have shown that peo­ple tend to value work time and leisure time dif­fer­ently, and they dis­count their value of time in leisure by as much as 40 per cent from their wage rates.</p>
    <p>The same is ex­pected from the value of house­work time where tra­di­tion­ally for­gone mar­ket wages would be used as a proxy mea­sure. In the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, this value would be less than the full wage rates. As the time de­voted to house­hold pro­duc­tion in­creases in­vol­un­tar­ily be­cause of re­duced op­tions in alternativ­e uses of time in­clud­ing mar­ket-work time, this value of time per hour would surely be val­ued less com­pared with pre-cir­cuit breaker days.</p>
    <p>TIME AS A COST</p>
    <p>In many pub­lic sec­tor projects or poli­cies, time is of­ten not given its proper value, whether as time sav­ings as bene­fits; or time costs where in­curred.</p>
    <p>In valu­ing time as a com­mod­ity, per­haps the most im­por­tant as­pect is not to value it with a sin­gle-pur­pose use in mind but rather to recog­nise that time should be val­ued by its dif­fer­ent uses, such as whether it is work or non-work­ing time, trav­el­ling time, leisure and recre­ational time, and time for house­hold pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>VOL­UN­TEER WORK</p>
    <p>One ma­jor use of time dur­ing this pan­demic is that many peo­ple of­fered to work as vol­un­teers in pub­lic health sup­port and in the myr­iad of ac­tiv­i­ties for as­sis­tance to the el­derly. Vol­un­teer work, though not re­mu­ner­ated, has eco­nomic value as peo­ple read­ily give up other uses of their time to do such vol­un­teer work, and this amount can and should be es­ti­mated in any ex­er­cise to elicit the cost of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Thus, whether we re­sort to us­ing for­gone wages as a mea­sure of op­por­tu­nity cost, or be­havioural es­ti­mates as to how peo­ple make choices be­tween sav­ing time and in­cur­ring higher mon­e­tary costs, one must take into con­sid­er­a­tion and ad­just such time val­u­a­tions given con­straints and re­stric­tions in the use of time dur­ing this pan­demic pe­riod.</p>
    <p>There will be many stud­ies at­tempt­ing to de­rive the to­tal cost of the pan­demic. Such costs will in­clude costs of med­i­cal treat­ment, hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion and health­care.</p>
    <p>Also in­cluded will be losses in pro­duc­tiv­ity and for­gone sav­ings, as well as losses in GDP, busi­ness and tourism, and losses from can­celled school classes and events, and lost in­tan­gi­bles such as re­duced so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties and in­ter­ac­tion, in­creased men­tal stresses and dys­func­tional fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>But an im­por­tant loss that should be recog­nised and ac­counted for is time costs. The short take from all this is that time is a good that has value in its use, and it is nec­es­sary to put a value on time costs or time sav­ings when we es­ti­mate the to­tal cost of the pan­demic as well as for mea­sur­ing the trade-off eco­nomic costs be­tween lock­downs (sav­ing liveli­hoods) and pub­lic health safety (sav­ing lives). Valu­ing time is there­fore cru­cial in any such stud­ies be­yond con­ven­tional mea­sure­ment of time in trans­port stud­ies.</p>
