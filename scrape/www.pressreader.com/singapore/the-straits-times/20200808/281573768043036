    <p>Covid-19 has cre­ated unique chal­lenges for coaches like Stephan Wid­mer, the na­tional swim­ming head coach and per­for­mance direc­tor. To help swim­mers stay sharp dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, when they were un­able to train in the pool, Wid­mer and his col­leagues had to think of in­no­va­tive train­ing ex­er­cises.</p>
    <p>In a cof­fee shop in Kal­lang a man is ex­tend­ing his arms to mimic the move­ment of a lizard. This is not a class in an­i­mal be­hav­iour, but a les­son in dry-land ex­er­cises from a swim­ming sa­vant. Na­tional swim­ming head coach and per­for­mance direc­tor Stephan Wid­mer, his cap­puc­cino go­ing cold, is ex­plain­ing how coaches work in a Covid time.</p>
    <p>With swim­mers ini­tially stuck at home dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, coaches had to be in­ven­tive. You can’t swim on land, says Wid­mer, but you can crawl on the floor, stay­ing low, arms reach­ing out like a lizard. “It is quite chal­leng­ing. What you have to do is con­nect from the fin­gers in the front to the feet in the back. The main aim is en­gag­ing the core.”</p>
    <p>Swim­mers had never had three months off and too long on land can play sub­tle havoc with a tuned ma­chine. “If I do a bit more run­ning on land, then my an­kles may get a bit stiffer,” Wid­mer ex­plains. “So I have the risk of los­ing an­kle mo­bil­ity which is so cru­cial for kicks.”</p>
    <p>And so this is what the coaches, nu­tri­tion­ists, biomech­a­nists, phys­io­ther­a­pists had to do, be more in­no­va­tive, in this case pro­vid­ing “a pro­gramme that main­tains the range of mo­tion and the mo­bil­ity of joints”.</p>
    <p>Wid­mer is a swim­ming ad­vo­cate – our in­ter­view com­prised al­most 11,000 words – who snaps open his lap­top, gives you a peek at pre­sen­ta­tions made for club coaches, for his con­cern dur­ing Covid is not just for elite ath­letes but the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>One of the things he kept telling coaches dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker was “re­main in (the swim­mers’) cor­ner, still be their coach, even if you can’t be there”. But swim­mers were also ex­pected to cleverly home­school them­selves. If they couldn’t swim, he says, they could at least study the skills of other ath­letes.</p>
    <p>So as they pull at stretch cords, they vi­su­alise the mo­tion of an­other great swim­mer. Think of it as a men­tal rac­ing re­hearsal. “Maybe watch videos of a great stroke and then close their eyes and en­vi­sion do­ing it that way”. Or even get in­spired by footage of them­selves swim­ming well. “If you were to do something like with Jo (School­ing), he’d prob­a­bly want to copy his own stroke be­cause his stroke is unique”.</p>
    <p>Never in Wid­mer’s con­ver­sa­tion do you sense weari­ness, for he is a so­lu­tion-fin­der who is in­trigued by dis­cov­ery. “One of the nice changes we saw was the alert­ness of the ath­letes. Be­cause they were sud­denly sleep­ing more.” And here, too, was a les­son: The brain needs to sleep.</p>
    <p>When the swim­mers re­turned to the pool it was like a team di­vided into pieces. Can’t walk in to­gether, can’t use the same doors, can’t hang in the locker room, can’t be too many in one lane, can’t share tow­els, can’t be any­where but in their small pre­scribed bub­bles.</p>
    <p>Sport is never a smooth road and the virus tests ev­ery­thing, like the art of com­mu­ni­ca­tion. It’s “quite tricky”, ex­plains Wid­mer, to film a swim­mer and show them a video on your tablet from three me­tres.</p>
    <p>Small im­ped­i­ments sur­faced. Usu­ally, he says, if a swim­mer is 20 paces away, coaches “are pretty good at send­ing our voices across pools even in com­pe­ti­tions when it’s noisy”. But the mask now muf­fles all long-dis­tance mes­sages.</p>
    <p>So sign lan­guage – which coaches use any­way – be­came con­ve­nient be­cause it’s pithy, fast and doesn’t re­quire a long walk across a pool deck. Touch­ing an el­bow is code for “keep the high el­bow” and point­ing to­wards the hip area means “use more core en­gage­ment”.</p>
    <p>Coaches have al­ways been prob­lem solvers but now the puz­zles are unique. One by-prod­uct of smaller bub­bles is that when groups get split up or re­duced in size it hurts com­pet­i­tive­ness. Be­cause nor­mally, when it comes down to the end of a set, ath­letes are push­ing each other and it builds fight­ing spirit. But now, says Wid­mer, “you sud­denly have fewer peo­ple in the group which means it’s less likely to have that per­fect sce­nario”.</p>
    <p>So coaches use “hand­i­cap races” more of­ten. Or, as he says, “you’re nor­mally 1.2 sec­onds faster than me in the last 50m, so I go first and you have to chase me down”. Does the swim­mer quickly chase a ri­val down or pace him­self – it all be­comes a les­son in ex­e­cu­tion. “It cre­ates a great plat­form again to learn about rac­ing un­der pres­sure and ex­pec­ta­tion.”</p>
    <p>Now the swim­mers have been back for a while and coaches are start­ing to push them. “One of the big­gest coach­ing tools that I feel coaches have to be great at,” says Wid­mer “is to teach your ath­letes to be su­per com­fort­able with be­ing in­cred­i­bly un­com­fort­able”.</p>
    <p>But what they found, un­der­stand­ably, was that in the three months out of wa­ter the ath­letes had for­got­ten a lit­tle about what it’s like to be un­com­fort­able. On land, you can’t mimic a sit­u­a­tion where the pain hits and your head’s full of noise and you still have to ex­e­cute a skill. They had for­got­ten “how hard they could push and how much they still had left when they thought that was it”. And so now the swim­mers are re-learn­ing how to stretch them­selves.</p>
    <p>At the heart of ev­ery­thing in an al­tered world is the abil­ity to adapt. “Covid,” says Wid­mer, “is just dis­guised as a chal­lenge and the hu­man race is nor­mally very good at step­ping up to the mark when chal­lenged”. Whing­ing is al­ways one op­tion, but to the in­tense man across the ta­ble this is also an op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>To be­come a bet­ter coach.</p>
    <p>Small im­ped­i­ments sur­faced. Usu­ally, Wid­mer says, if a swim­mer is 20 paces away, coaches “are pretty good at send­ing our voices across pools even in com­pe­ti­tions when it’s noisy”. But the mask now muf­fles all long-dis­tance mes­sages.</p>
