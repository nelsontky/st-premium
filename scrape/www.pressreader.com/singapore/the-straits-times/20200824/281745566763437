    <p>Coro­n­avirus cases have been surg­ing faster in In­dia than any­where else in the world for close to three weeks now, as the pan­demic en­gulfs ru­ral ar­eas and ramps up pres­sure on the coun­try’s shaky health­care sys­tem.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s of­fi­cial daily to­tal of new cases has inched closer to 70,000 for the last four con­sec­u­tive days, tak­ing its tally past the three mil­lion mark on Satur­day with a sin­gle­day spike of 69,239 in­fec­tions. This comes just 15 days af­ter it crossed two mil­lion cases on Aug 7.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day morn­ing, the of­fi­cial death toll stood at 56,706, af­ter 912 deaths were added to the tally from the pre­vi­ous day.</p>
    <p>There are con­cerns that the health in­fra­struc­ture in ru­ral ar­eas is not equipped to han­dle the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Dr T. Sundararam­an, global co­or­di­na­tor of the Peo­ple’s Health Move­ment, told The Straits Times that ar­eas in the north and east are par­tic­u­larly vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>“Their abil­ity to pro­vide in­ten­sive care at a level that will be re­quired is highly com­pro­mised. There has been a whole level of com­pla­cency in pre­par­ing for it,” he said.</p>
    <p>The im­pact of the surge in in­fec­tions in In­dia has been felt in Singapore too, which has seen 141 im­ported Covid-19 cases since Aug 1. Of these, 96 were trav­ellers ar­riv­ing from In­dia.</p>
    <p>And while In­dia still trails be­hind the United States and Brazil in terms of to­tal coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, it could over­take them in the com­ing weeks as it has been re­port­ing more cases than ei­ther of them in re­cent days.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s rise in cases comes on the back of in­creased test­ing and the in­fec­tion mak­ing its way into ru­ral ar­eas, away from the big cities that were first im­pacted by the pan­demic. On Aug 21, In­dia crossed a sig­nif­i­cant mile­stone of test­ing more than one mil­lion sam­ples in a day, tak­ing to­tal tests to more than 34 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>De­spite the spike in in­fec­tions, the re­cov­ery rate of pa­tients in In­dia has im­proved to 74.69 per cent and the case fa­tal­ity rate has dropped to 1.87 per cent, which is one of the low­est in the world. In­dia also recorded a new high of re­cov­er­ies on Satur­day – at 63,631.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 deaths world­wide, mean­while, passed 804,000 on Satur­day as cases rose to more than 23 mil­lion, ac­cord­ing to data from Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity and Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>Mex­ico, which has the world’s third-high­est death toll, also moved past an­other grim mile­stone on Satur­day with 644 ad­di­tional fa­tal­i­ties that brought the coun­try’s to­tal num­ber of deaths to 60,254. The num­ber of cases stood at 556,216, with 6,482 new cases on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>South Korea, once praised for sup­press­ing the pan­demic, also con­tin­ued to bat­tle a new wave of in­fec­tions that is now spread­ing be­yond Seoul and Bu­san to its pro­vin­cial ar­eas.</p>
    <p>The coun­try re­ported 397 new virus cases yes­ter­day, ac­cord­ing to Yon­hap news agency. This is the high­est num­ber since March 7 and marks more than a week of daily three-digit in­creases. It is also the first time in re­cent weeks that 100 cases had been re­ported out­side of greater Seoul.</p>
    <p>Else­where i n Asia, In­done­sia added over 2,000 new in­fec­tions yes­ter­day, bring­ing its to­tal to 153,535. Its death toll from the virus re­mains the high­est in South-east Asia at 6,680, af­ter an­other 86 fa­tal­i­ties were re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In Italy, fresh daily cases went past the thou­sand mark, reach­ing this level for the first time since early May. Con­firmed new cases touched 1,071 on Satur­day, with many in­fec­tions de­tected in trav­ellers who were tested as they re­turned to the Ital­ian main­land from Sar­dinia af­ter hol­i­day­ing.</p>
    <p>Other coun­tries in Europe, such as France and Ger­many, have also seen a sim­i­lar in­crease in in­fec­tions in re­cent days, which has sparked fears of a new wave.</p>
    <p>Brazil recorded 50,032 new cases of Covid-19 on Satur­day. The coun­try has reg­is­tered more than 3.5 mil­lion cases and more than 112,000 deaths. Both fig­ures are sec­ond­high­est to­tals, fol­low­ing the US. There are signs, how­ever, that the pan­demic may be plateau­ing in this global hot spot.</p>
    <p>From a daily high of 69,074 on July 29, the num­ber of daily new in­fec­tions has sta­bilised to be­tween 50,000 and 60,000. Any re­ver­sal of the spread of the virus in Brazil would be “a suc­cess for the world”, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion has said.</p>
    <p>The US, on the other hand, reg­is­tered more than 45,000 new cases and 958 deaths on Satur­day, tak­ing its to­tal to 5.69 mil­lion cases and 176,355 deaths re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Their abil­ity to pro­vide in­ten­sive care at a level that will be re­quired is highly com­pro­mised. There has been a whole level of com­pla­cency in pre­par­ing for it. ’’ DR T. SUNDARARAM­AN, global co­or­di­na­tor of the Peo­ple’s Health Move­ment, on how ar­eas in the north and east of the coun­try are par­tic­u­larly vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>De­spite the spike in in­fec­tions, the re­cov­ery rate of pa­tients in In­dia has im­proved to 74.69 per cent and the case fa­tal­ity rate has dropped to 1.87 per cent, which is one of the low­est in the world.</p>
