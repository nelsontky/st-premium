    <p>Less than a day af­ter Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son an­nounced on Satur­day a month-long lock­down for Eng­land, Cabi­net Of­fice Min­is­ter Michael Gove sig­nalled that the mea­sures may have to be ex­tended if they fail to con­tain the spread of Covid-19. “It will get re­viewed on Dec 2,” he said in an in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>BER­LIN • Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son has be­come Europe’s lat­est leader to re­treat from a no-lock­down pledge, faced with a pan­demic that is wreak­ing havoc on gov­ern­ment plans and de­rail­ing an eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>A one-month stay-at-home pol­icy for all of Eng­land will take ef­fect on Thurs­day, with waivers for schools, uni­ver­si­ties and es­sen­tial stores, Mr John­son said on Satur­day as Bri­tain’s Covid-19 cases sur­passed one mil­lion. Ger­many and France im­posed sim­i­lar par­tial shut­downs last week.</p>
    <p>Lead­ers across the re­gion are seek­ing to beat back the virus surge be­fore the end-of-year hol­i­day sea­son in Europe.</p>
    <p>“Christ­mas is go­ing to be dif­fer­ent this year,” Mr John­son said. “But it’s my sin­cere hope and be­lief that by tak­ing tough ac­tion now, we can al­low fam­i­lies across the coun­try to be to­gether.”</p>
    <p>Cabi­net Of­fice Min­is­ter Michael Gove said yes­ter­day that the mea­sures might have to be ex­tended if they fail to con­tain the spread of the coron­avirus. “It will get re­viewed on Dec 2, but we’re al­ways driven by what the data shows,” Mr Gove said in a Sky News in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>In Ger­many, start­ing to­day, bars, restau­rants, leisure fa­cil­i­ties and cul­tural venues have to close, while schools and most shops can re­main open. France be­gan its ver­sion of “lock­down lite” last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Bel­gium is clos­ing all non-es­sen­tial stores and cur­tail­ing fam­ily vis­its to avoid crash­ing its health­care sys­tem. And Greek Prime Min­is­ter Kyr­i­akos Mit­so­takis, in­tent on avoid­ing a na­tional lock­down, ex­panded eco­nomic aid for busi­nesses and tight­ened re­stric­tions in pop­u­la­tion cen­tres.</p>
    <p>With protests mul­ti­ply­ing and po­lit­i­cal unity fray­ing, of­fi­cials had been try­ing to avoid the sweep­ing re­stric­tions that plunged the con­ti­nent into re­ces­sion in the spring.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son’s de­ci­sion to lock down Eng­land came af­ter its out­break out­stripped the gov­ern­ment’s worst-case pro­jec­tions. “The mea­sures... are less pro­hib­i­tive (than the full-scale lock­down in spring),” he said.</p>
    <p>Fur­loughed work­ers will be el­i­gi­ble for state pay­ments cov­er­ing as much as 80 per cent of wages through the new lock­down pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Cases in Bri­tain in­creased by al­most 22,000 on Satur­day. The coun­try leads Europe’s Covid-19 death toll, with more than 46,000 fa­tal­i­ties com­pared with France’s 36,800 deaths with a sim­i­lar pop­u­la­tion size.</p>
    <p>In Ger­many, Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel and busi­ness lead­ers will dis­cuss eas­ing the bur­den on in­dus­try on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“We need to do ev­ery­thing in our power to get the in­fec­tion num­bers un­der con­trol” while pro­tect­ing jobs, Dr Merkel said.</p>
    <p>She had an­nounced mea­sures last week to se­verely limit move­ment, while keep­ing schools open and the econ­omy tick­ing over.</p>
    <p>Ger­many is in a “dra­matic sit­u­a­tion”, with health­care ser­vices stretched close to the limit and of­fi­cials no longer able to track in­fec­tions back to the source, she said.</p>
    <p>Dr Merkel is strug­gling to re­tain con­trol over the cri­sis. An ad­dress she made in Par­lia­ment last Thurs­day was re­peat­edly in­ter­rupted by heck­ling from op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers as she con­demned “lies and dis­in­for­ma­tion, con­spir­acy and hate”.</p>
    <p>France’s goal is to limit eco­nomic con­trac­tion to 15 per cent dur­ing the lat­est lock­down, about half of the 30 per cent de­cline dur­ing March’s lock­down, ac­cord­ing to Fi­nance Min­is­ter Bruno Le Maire.</p>
    <p>That was caused, in par­tic­u­lar, by a halt in con­struc­tion work while this time, build­ing sites and stores sell­ing build­ing ma­te­ri­als will re­main open, as well as gov­ern­ment ser­vices han­dling per­mits.</p>
    <p>The new curbs were an­nounced less than a week af­ter France ex­panded a cur­few to about twothirds of the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron told the na­tion last week: “The virus is cir­cu­lat­ing in France at a speed that even the most pes­simistic fore­cast didn’t fore­see.”</p>
    <p>On Fri­day, France re­ported the most new deaths since April 20, the same day the first lock­down went into ef­fect.</p>
    <p>In neigh­bour­ing Italy, Health Min­is­ter Roberto Sper­anza said yes­ter­day that new data on the coron­avirus was “ter­ri­fy­ing” and that the coun­try had two days to ap­prove fur­ther re­stric­tions to curb its spread.</p>
    <p>Italy recorded al­most 32,000 new Covid-19 cases on Satur­day, its high­est daily record since the start of the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“We have 48 hours to try to ap­prove a fur­ther tight­en­ing (of the rules), there are too many peo­ple around,” Mr Sper­anza was quoted as say­ing by lo­cal daily Cor­riere della Sera.</p>
    <p>“The epi­demi­o­log­i­cal curve is still very high. What wor­ries me the most is the ab­so­lute data, which shows a ter­ri­fy­ing curve.”</p>
    <p>A new lock­down ap­peared to be the only op­tion, he added.</p>
    <p>Italy, which has al­ready been un­der a par­tial lock­down for the past week, could add a ban on travel be­tween re­gions, Cor­riere della Sera had re­ported on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Mi­lan, Naples, Bologna, Turin and Rome are among ci­ties that could face lock­downs of at least parts of their met­ro­pol­i­tan ar­eas.</p>
    <p>In Spain, a ma­jor­ity of the coun­try’s 17 re­gions have al­ready closed their do­mes­tic bor­ders or will do so this week, pre­vent­ing non-es­sen­tial travel. Tar­geted re­gional lock­downs will re­main in force un­til at least Nov 9.</p>
    <p>Spain re­ported more than 9,000 daily coron­avirus in­fec­tions on two con­sec­u­tive days last week, the most since track­ing started.</p>
