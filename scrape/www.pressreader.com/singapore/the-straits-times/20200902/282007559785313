    <p>A 45-year-old man orig­i­nally sen­tenced to five years’ jail and six strokes of the cane for mo­lest­ing a mar­ried wo­man he in­vited to his home was ac­quit­ted yes­ter­day, af­ter his ap­peal to the High Court.</p>
    <p>Mr Chen Ben­zhong, a pho­tog­ra­pher, was charged with hug­ging the 39-year-old wo­man and touch­ing her breasts af­ter pin­ning her down on a bed.</p>
    <p>He con­tested the charges, ar­gu­ing that she was a will­ing party in the in­ci­dent on Sept 3, 2017, but a dis­trict judge found him guilty of two mo­lesta­tion charges last year.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, High Court Judge Chua Lee Ming al­lowed the ap­peal, say­ing that it was un­safe to up­hold the con­vic­tion.</p>
    <p>The judge ac­cepted ar­gu­ments by Mr Chen’s lawyers, Mr Philip Fong and Mr Hee Theng Fong, that his in­ten­tion of ask­ing the wo­man to spend the night with him was very clear in text mes­sages be­tween them.</p>
    <p>In mes­sages to the wo­man the night be­fore, Mr Chen, who is also mar­ried, in­vited her to his home, not­ing that her hus­band was out of town.</p>
    <p>She asked “is it safe”, and when he asked if it would be okay if she did not go home, she replied with an emoji of a shocked face.</p>
    <p>The judge said she was clearly aware of the man’s in­ten­tion and was at least open to the pos­si­bil­ity of a tryst with him.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chua also noted that when Mr Chen asked her to go to his bed­room, she com­plied.</p>
    <p>He also found it “dif­fi­cult” to see how her bra could have been un­hooked, based on her ac­count of how she was be­ing held down.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Mr Chen, who met the wo­man four months be­fore the in­ci­dent, had sent her mes­sages with terms of en­dear­ment.</p>
    <p>The wo­man, who can­not be named due to a gag or­der to pro­tect her iden­tity, main­tained that they were just friends.</p>
    <p>She tes­ti­fied that she had asked Mr Chen to help her pho­to­graph some beauty prod­ucts that she was sell­ing and he in­vited her to his stu­dio, which turned out to be his flat.</p>
    <p>She al­leged that he re­peat­edly told her to go to the bed­room, and she re­luc­tantly fol­lowed him.</p>
    <p>She claimed that af­ter he hugged her, she tried to push him away. But he pushed her onto the bed, reached un­der her blouse and tugged at her bra be­fore grop­ing her. She added that he stopped af­ter she shouted loudly.</p>
    <p>The wo­man then ran out of the room and locked her­self in the bath­room, where she phoned a col­league for help. She also told Mr Chen to go to his room.</p>
    <p>Af­ter more than one hour, she came out of the bath­room, searched for the keys and left the flat with­out her shoes.</p>
    <p>Her col­league and two po­lice of­fi­cers who saw her at the void deck tes­ti­fied that she was cry­ing, said Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Joshua Lim. But Mr Chen’s lawyers ar­gued that signs of dis­tress did not mean she had been vi­o­lated.</p>
