    <p>Fraz­zled store as­sis­tants prompted the novel de­sign of Sun­day Sta­ples’ new­est out­let.</p>
    <p>The lo­cal fast-fash­ion footwear brand ob­served how, at its first two stores in Far East Plaza and Sun­tec City, re­tail as­sis­tants were swamped serv­ing mul­ti­ple cus­tomers who wanted to try nu­mer­ous pairs of shoes.</p>
    <p>“Cus­tomers would point at four dif­fer­ent pairs and want to try them in their sizes, and our staff would have to go to the store­room and re­mem­ber which shoes to take,” says co-founder Mau­rice Bay, 33. “Some­times, cus­tomers try up to 10 pairs.”</p>
    <p>Other times, they would wave the shoes on dis­play at store as­sis­tants and the dis­play shoes would end up mis­placed.</p>
    <p>For the new store open­ing on Jan 16 at 313@som­er­set, Mr Bay and his wife, who is a co-founder, did away with the scat­tered seat­ing of con­ven­tional shoe stores and built des­ig­nated booths for cus­tomers to try shoes com­fort­ably.</p>
    <p>The footwear is dis­played on shelves with cor­re­spond­ing wooden tags. Shop­pers col­lect tags for the styles they want to try, pass them to store staff and head to the booths, which were partly in­spired by those in Amer­i­can din­ers.</p>
    <p>For a seam­less ex­pe­ri­ence, ta­bles on the side are equipped with bar­code scan­ners for con­tact­less pay­ment, adds Mr Bay.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple spent more than $200,000 on ren­o­va­tions “af­ter ex­ten­sive hag­gling”.</p>
    <p>“Struc­turally, curves are re­ally ex­pen­sive to make,” he says. But the curvy look is on trend with other re­tail stores and cafes, he points out, and par­al­lels the shift in cus­tomers’ buy­ing pat­terns.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the cir­cuit breaker, he no­ticed cus­tomers buy­ing more slides than heels as they edged to­wards com­fort and work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>“Sim­i­larly, I think the re­tail store look and feel have started to soften – mov­ing away from the clean, pro­fes­sional look of sharp edges and white lights, to­wards soft curves and warm light­ing. It’s that home­away-from-home vibe.”</p>
    <p>Asked how the decor may pay off, he says: “The booths and in­stant check­out al­low for quicker con­ver­sion. It re­duces buyer remorse when they are queue­ing to pay and low­ers the chance of los­ing a sale.”</p>
    <p>But more im­por­tantly, de­tails such as co­or­di­nat­ing the colour scheme of the store to the pal­ette of their shoes play a big­ger part in build­ing brand iden­tity, he says.</p>
    <p>“The en­tire store is in line with this theme that our cus­tomers can re­late to. It’s om­nichan­nel and ho­moge­nous – you get the same ex­pe­ri­ence on­line and off­line.”</p>
