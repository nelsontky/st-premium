    <p>Three in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tors from Eagle Hos­pi­tal­ity Trust (EHT) – Tarun Kataria, Lau Chun Wah and Kelvin Tan – who were among those pre­vi­ously ar­rested and re­leased on bail, have re­signed from the sta­pled group’s board.</p>
    <p>Last Oc­to­ber, EHT an­nounced that six of its for­mer and cur­rent Sin­ga­pore-based di­rec­tors had been ar­rested on “rea­son­able sus­pi­cion” that dis­clo­sure re­quire­ments may have been breached.</p>
    <p>The other di­rec­tors are Salvatore G. Tak­oushian, Carl Gabriel Flo­rian Stubbe and Ng Kheng Choo.</p>
    <p>Some of them cur­rently sit on, or were on, the boards of other lo­cally listed com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>EHT is a sta­pled trust com­pris­ing Eagle Hos­pi­tal­ity Real Es­tate In­vest­ment Trust (EH-Reit) and the cur­rently dor­mant Eagle Hos­pi­tal­ity Busi­ness Trust.</p>
    <p>DBS Trustee is the trustee of EHReit.</p>
    <p>In a bourse fil­ing yes­ter­day, DBS</p>
    <p>Trustee noted that Kataria, 62, had re­signed from the board with ef­fect from Dec 31 last year to “pur­sue per­sonal in­ter­ests”.</p>
    <p>Kataria was also a mem­ber of EHT’s au­dit and risk com­mit­tee, nom­i­nat­ing and re­mu­ner­a­tion com­mit­tee and spe­cial com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>He is also on the board of Maple­tree Lo­gis­tics Trust Man­age­ment, among other com­pa­nies’ boards.</p>
    <p>Lau re­signed with ef­fect from Tues­day to “pur­sue other per­sonal com­mit­ments”, DBS Trustee said.</p>
    <p>Lau, 66, is also chair­man of EHT’s nom­i­nat­ing and re­mu­ner­a­tion com­mit­tee and spe­cial com­mit­tee, as well as a mem­ber of the au­dit and risk com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>And Tan, 56, is leav­ing the board to “ex­plore other op­por­tu­ni­ties”, ac­cord­ing to DBS Trustee. To­day is the ef­fec­tive date of this ces­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The three di­rec­tors were ap­pointed in April 2019.</p>
    <p>Taken to­gether, their res­ig­na­tions leave EHT’s au­dit com­mit­tee without the req­ui­site min­i­mum of three mem­bers as stip­u­lated in the Com­pa­nies Act and Catal­ist rules.</p>
    <p>Over the past 12 months, there have been seven ces­sa­tions of ap­point­ments re­lated to key mem­bers of the com­pany, a reg­u­la­tory fil­ing yes­ter­day showed.</p>
    <p>Last week, unit hold­ers of the be­lea­guered EHT voted against the pro­posed change of a manager.</p>
    <p>Se­cu­rity hold­ers voted on four in­ter-con­di­tional res­o­lu­tions at an ex­tra­or­di­nary gen­eral meet­ing.</p>
    <p>One res­o­lu­tion that failed to re­ceive the nec­es­sary votes to pass was a pro­posed base fee sup­ple­ment to pay a new Reit manager – SCCPRE Hos­pi­tal­ity Reit Man­age­ment – at least US$4.5 mil­lion (S$6 mil­lion) a year.</p>
    <p>This ex­tra­or­di­nary res­o­lu­tion re­quired at least 75 per cent of the vote share to be in favour, but gar­nered only 56.3 per cent.</p>
    <p>EHT units have been sus­pended. They last traded at 13.7 US cents on March 19 last year.</p>
