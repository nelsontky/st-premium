    <p>Po­ten­tial Hyflux in­vestor Pi­son In­vest­ments said on Tues­day it has hith­erto re­ceived 158 ten­der ap­pli­ca­tion forms from note hold­ers and other el­i­gi­ble cred­i­tors, but ef­forts to en­gage with the un­se­cured work­ing group (UWG) of seven banks have fallen through.</p>
    <p>The banks are Mizuho, KfW, Bangkok Bank, BNP Paribas, Stan­dard Char­tered Bank, CTBC Bank and Korea Devel­op­ment Bank.</p>
    <p>Last month, the group filed its ap­pli­ca­tion for a ju­di­cial man­age­ment order, after the court gave the go-ahead for it to be carved out of Hyflux’s debt mo­ra­to­rium.</p>
    <p>This was be­cause the UWG felt it could no longer trust Hyflux’s man­age­ment to lead any re­struc­tur­ing ef­fort.</p>
    <p>Given the lack of progress in mov­ing mat­ters for­ward through the UWG’s ad­vis­ers, Pi­son took the ini­tia­tive to reach out to the mem­bers of the UWG di­rectly, via in­vi­ta­tion ad­viser Cor­po­rate FinEdge, with its pro­posal to buy out their debt.</p>
    <p>Pi­son, the in­vest­ment ve­hi­cle of In­done­sian mag­nate Johnny Wid­jaja, had in early July made a for­mal cash of­fer for the debts of Hyflux’s bank lenders, note hold­ers and other se­nior un­se­cured cred­i­tors via a “re­verse Dutch auction”.</p>
    <p>It said in a let­ter on Tues­day to Hyflux’s ex­ec­u­tive chair­man and group chief ex­ec­u­tive Olivia Lum that more than 40 note hold­ers at­tended a town hall meet­ing via Zoom on Aug 31 for Cor­po­rate FinEdge to walk them through the key terms of the in­vi­ta­tion mem­o­ran­dum. Their ques­tions were an­swered by Mr Wid­jaja.</p>
    <p>Pi­son as­sessed the note hold­ers ap­peared “gen­uinely in­ter­ested” in the of­fer.</p>
    <p>It added that it was “very en­cour­aged” that a “sig­nif­i­cant por­tion” of el­i­gi­ble cred­i­tors had taken part in the ten­der, in­clud­ing es­tab­lished fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions and cor­po­ra­tions such as ma­jor banks and multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>Al­though the Sept 4 dead­line has passed, it con­tin­ues to re­ceive sub­mis­sions of ten­der ap­pli­ca­tion forms and will con­sider them.</p>
    <p>Pi­son, how­ever, has yet to re­ceive any ten­der ap­pli­ca­tions from the mem­bers of the UWG. It reached out to each mem­ber in July.</p>
    <p>“There are ten­der ap­pli­ca­tion forms Pi­son has re­ceived from el­i­gi­ble cred­i­tors with a quan­tum of el­i­gi­ble debt larger than some mem­bers of the UWG.”</p>
    <p>These el­i­gi­ble cred­i­tors must have found the terms of the in­vi­ta­tion mem­o­ran­dum ac­cept­able, it said.</p>
    <p>Pi­son also said more than 150 other el­i­gi­ble cred­i­tors who have sub­mit­ted ten­der ap­pli­ca­tions must have found the terms ac­cept­able too.</p>
    <p>Pi­son has to de­cide which of the sub­mit­ted ten­ders to ac­cept by 5pm on Sept 25.</p>
    <p>It said that once it has com­pleted the pur­chase of a “sig­nif­i­cant por­tion” of the el­i­gi­ble debt, it will turn its at­ten­tion to the hold­ers of the per­pet­ual cap­i­tal se­cu­ri­ties and pref­er­ence shares (P&P hold­ers).</p>
    <p>“We are in­tent on and keen to progress the in­vi­ta­tion mem­o­ran­dum to com­ple­tion, ac­tively en­gage with the UWG mem­bers and deal with the P&P hold­ers through the Se­cu­ri­ties In­vestors As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore) and its ad­vis­ers over the course of the next few weeks,” it added.</p>
    <p>Pi­son is to make pay­ment for the ac­cepted bids on the set­tle­ment date of Oct 23. The long-stop date on the deal is Dec 31.</p>
    <p>Hyflux said it will make an­nounce­ments when there are fur­ther ma­te­rial de­vel­op­ments on the mat­ter.</p>
