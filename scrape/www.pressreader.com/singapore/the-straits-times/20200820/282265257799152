    <p>BOS­TON • Im Sung-jae heads into The North­ern Trust to­day with a spring in his step as he chases his dream of be­com­ing Asia’s first win­ner of the PGA Tour’s ul­ti­mate prize, the FedEx­Cup.</p>
    <p>The 22-year-old South Korean has con­tin­ued to blos­som as one of the most ex­cit­ing stars in the game and en­ters the first week of the play-offs ranked fifth in the FedEx­Cup stand­ings, and in prime po­si­tion to chal­lenge for a slice of golf his­tory in what has been an ab­bre­vi­ated sea­son.</p>
    <p>Asia has been wait­ing to cel­e­brate its first FedEx­Cup cham­pion since the sea­son-long race was in­au­gu­rated in 2007 and Im will have six other rep­re­sen­ta­tives from the re­gion for com­pany. Com­pa­tri­ots An Byeong-Hun (world No. 55), Kang Sung-hoon (No. 62), Kim Si­woo (No. 86), Lee Ky­oung-hoon (No. 224); Ja­pan’s Hideki Mat­suyama (No. 27); and Zhang Xin­jun (No. 131), the first Chi­nese golfer to qual­ify for the play-offs, carry the con­ti­nent’s hopes.</p>
    <p>Im, who won The Honda Clas­sic in March and has six other top-10 fin­ishes this sea­son, tied for ninth at last week’s Wyn­d­ham Cham­pi­onship which was a timely re­turn to form. He had un­char­ac­ter­is­ti­cally missed three cuts in his pre­vi­ous seven starts when golf made a re­turn in June fol­low­ing a three­month sus­pen­sion due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“It feels great to have my swing back,” said the world No. 24, who earned the nick­name “Ironman Im” after play­ing in 35 events en route to be­com­ing Rookie of the Year last sea­son. “I would, of course, like to win the FedEx­Cup, but there are so many strong com­peti­tors. If I were to win, I don’t think I could even put into words what it would mean to me. It would def­i­nitely be a turn­ing point in my ca­reer.”</p>
    <p>Straight-shoot­ing Mat­suyama has been one of Asia’s star per­form­ers over the past few sea­sons, where he has not fin­ished lower than 16th po­si­tion on the fi­nal FedEx­Cup stand­ings since 2015.</p>
    <p>He tees off at TPC Bos­ton ranked 18th, with four top-25 fin­ishes since June.</p>
    <p>“I still have so much more to learn and a lot of work ahead to achieve the goals I have set for my­self, which in­clude play­ing in the Tour Cham­pi­onship ev­ery year, win­ning on the PGA Tour and, of course, win­ning a Ma­jor tour­na­ment,” said the five-time Tour win­ner.</p>
    <p>The fi­nale of the three-round play-offs is the Sept 4-7 Tour Cham­pi­onship at East Lake Golf Club out­side At­lanta, Georgia, and is lim­ited to the top-30 golfers, with the cham­pion pock­et­ing US$15 mil­lion (S$20.5 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can Justin Thomas starts the play-offs ranked No. 1, fol­lowed by ris­ing star Collin Morikawa and Webb Simpson in third.</p>
    <p>Reign­ing FedEx­Cup cham­pion Rory McIl­roy is in eighth while Tiger Woods, a two-time win­ner and ranked 49th, is also in the TPC Bos­ton field this week.</p>
