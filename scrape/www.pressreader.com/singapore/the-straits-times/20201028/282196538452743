    <p>HONG KONG • Ant Group will close in­sti­tu­tional or­der books of the Hong Kong por­tion of its record­set­ting dual ini­tial pu­bic of­fer­ing (IPO) ahead of sched­ule due to strong de­mand, sources with di­rect knowl­edge of the mat­ter said.</p>
    <p>The i nsti­tu­tional book of the US$17.2 bil­lion (S$23.4 bil­lion) Hong Kong list­ing was due to close to­mor­row, but that dead­line will be ac­cel­er­ated to 5pm to­day in each re­gion, three sources said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The book was over­sub­scribed just one hour af­ter the launch on Mon­day, ac­cord­ing to two sep­a­rate sources, demon­strat­ing in­vestor frenzy for shares in the Chi­nese fin­tech gi­ant that has stoked heavy de­mand for cash and sent Hong Kong money mar­ket rates to five-month highs.</p>
    <p>Ant Group de­clined to com­ment on the planned early clo­sure of the Hong Kong in­sti­tu­tional book.</p>
    <p>It is look­ing to raise up to US$34.4 bil­lion in Hong Kong and Shang­hai, with the of­fer split be­tween the two cities, giv­ing it a val­u­a­tion of about US$312 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Ant, which runs China’s big­gest mo­bile pay­ments plat­form Ali­pay, is an af­fil­i­ate of e-com­merce gi­ant Alibaba Group Hold­ing.</p>
    <p>It will of­fer 41.76 mil­lion shares, or 2.5 per cent of its to­tal shares in Hong Kong, to re­tail in­vestors whose de­mand to buy the stock is ex­pected to be strong.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong op­er­ates a “claw­back” sys­tem where heavy over­sub­scrip­tion from small in­vestors can re­sult in them get­ting a greater share.</p>
    <p>Ant’s IPO prospec­tus shows the to­tal amount will be in­creased to 167.1 mil­lion shares, or 10 per cent of the deal, if the ini­tial re­tail al­lo­ca­tion is more than 20 times over­sub­scribed.</p>
    <p>The city’s bro­kers are ready­ing bil­lions of dol­lars of mar­gin fi­nanc­ing to lend to cus­tomers to buy the stock. Re­tail in­vestors need to fi­nalise and pay for the shares they have bid for by Fri­day, ac­cord­ing to Ant’s prospec­tus.</p>
    <p>The cash will be locked up un­til al­lo­ca­tions are an­nounced on Nov 4, and bro­kers ex­pect it could tie up more than HK$1 tril­lion (S$175 bil­lion) in re­tail funds.</p>
    <p>“The de­mand is over­whelm­ing... it will smash all pre­vi­ous records,” Mr Fran­cis Lun, Hong Kong-based chief ex­ec­u­tive of GEO Se­cu­ri­ties, said about re­tail de­mand for Ant.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Hong Kong’s money mar­kets tight­ened yes­ter­day as de­mand for cash to buy Ant shares pushed up Hong Kong dol­lar rates. The one-week Hong Kong In­ter­bank Of­fered Rate (Hi­bor) jumped nearly 40 ba­sis points to 0.51054 per cent, its high­est since late May.</p>
    <p>Spot week Hong Kong dol­lar for­wards also hit their most ex­pen­sive since May.</p>
    <p>“Given the size of the IPO... ev­ery man and their dog will be try­ing to get in, and that means a lot of money is go­ing to be locked up which causes a tight­en­ing and squeezes the Hi­bor up,” said Mr Khoon Goh, head of Asia re­search at ANZ Bank in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“But once it’s over, and who­ever is lucky gets their hands on it, the rest of them will have their money re­turned... the Hi­bor will drop.”</p>

Ant’s IPO prospec­tus shows the to­tal amount will be in­creased to 167.1 mil­lion shares, or 10 per cent of the deal, if the ini­tial re­tail al­lo­ca­tion is more than 20 times over­sub­scribed.</p>
