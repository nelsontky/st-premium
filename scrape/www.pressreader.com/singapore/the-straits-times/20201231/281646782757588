    <p>Crew mem­bers of Sin­ga­pore car­ri­ers will have to un­dergo stricter Covid-19 control mea­sures with im­me­di­ate ef­fect, fol­low­ing news that a Sin­ga­pore Air­lines cabin crew mem­ber and a pi­lot have tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>An­nounc­ing this last night, the Civil Avi­a­tion Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (CAAS) said it was tight­en­ing mea­sures to en­sure the safety and well-be­ing of air crew and to safe­guard public health in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“Air crew face con­sid­er­able risks in the course of their du­ties. They do so be­cause it is crit­i­cal for Sin­ga­pore to main­tain air con­nec­tiv­ity. Many es­sen­tial sup­plies, such as vac­cines, can only be de­liv­ered by air. Sin­ga­pore­ans over­seas and other es­sen­tial trav­ellers need to be able to travel to and from Sin­ga­pore,” CAAS said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>It added that its pre­lim­i­nary in­ves­ti­ga­tions had found that both the in­fected cabin crew mem­ber and pi­lot had ad­hered to the man­dated in-flight and lay­over mea­sures, in­clud­ing wear­ing a mask, min­imis­ing con­tact with pas­sen­gers and lo­cals, and stay­ing in their ho­tel rooms through­out.</p>
    <p>The cabin crew mem­ber tested pos­i­tive on Dec 27. He had last flown to New York on Flight SQ24 on Dec 12.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the lay­over in New York, he in­ter­acted with the im­mi­gra­tion of­fi­cer and ho­tel check-in staff, and col­lected his meal from a ho­tel em­ployee who de­liv­ered it to his room.</p>
    <p>He then re­turned to Sin­ga­pore on Dec 16 on Flight SQ23.</p>
    <p>He was asymp­to­matic at the time and was tested on Dec 23 and 25 un­der the test­ing pro­to­col for</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore car­ri­ers’ air crew when they re­turn from over­seas. Both tests were in­con­clu­sive, but an ad­di­tional test on Dec 27 re­turned pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>All crew mem­bers and 16 pas­sen­gers who were seated in the sec­tion of the air­craft cabin served by him have tested neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health sep­a­rately con­firmed with The Straits Times yes­ter­day that the man had also driven for Grab from Dec 17 to 24.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond case, a pi­lot, tested pos­i­tive on Dec 29. He had last flown to Lon­don on Flight SQ322 on Dec 19. Dur­ing the lay­over in Lon­don, he in­ter­acted with the im­mi­gra­tion of­fi­cer and ho­tel checkin staff, and also had a meal de­liv­ered to his room by a ho­tel em­ployee.</p>
    <p>He then re­turned to Sin­ga­pore on Dec 22 on Flight SQ317. On both flights, he had no con­tact with pas­sen­gers on board.</p>
    <p>He was tested on Dec 23 and re­ceived a neg­a­tive re­sult on Dec 25. But on Dec 26, he de­vel­oped a fever. The fol­low­ing day, he went to a clinic for a poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) test, which re­turned pos­i­tive on Dec 29.</p>
    <p>CAAS said that after con­sult­ing with MOH, it will now re­quire air crew on lay­over to fur­ther min­imise their con­tact with lo­cals.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, food de­liv­ered through room ser­vice should be left out­side the room at the door in­stead of be­ing handed over.</p>
    <p>Those who lay over in high-risk des­ti­na­tions will be re­quired to un­dergo a PCR test on ar­rival, and on the third and sev­enth day fol­low­ing their re­turn to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Crew mem­bers will be re­quired to self-iso­late un­til they re­ceive a neg­a­tive re­sult from their sev­enth day PCR test.</p>
    <p>Also, crew trav­el­ling to and from South Africa will have to don full per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment, in­clud­ing N95 masks, face shields, pro­tec­tive gowns and gloves.</p>
    <p>This is in ad­di­tion to the cur­rent strin­gent mea­sures in place on Sin­ga­pore-based air­lines, which in­clude crew mem­bers hav­ing to mask up at all times and wear gog­gles while in­ter­act­ing with pas­sen­gers. Where pos­si­ble, they use sep­a­rate toi­lets from the pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>Air crew are also as­signed spe­cific sec­tions within the air­craft to fa­cil­i­tate con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>CAAS added that to date, over 22,500 PCR tests have been car­ried out on air crew, with all but the two cases test­ing neg­a­tive.</p>
