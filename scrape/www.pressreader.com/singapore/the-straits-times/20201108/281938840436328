    <p>I had to ask my sis­ters to sup­port me fi­nan­cially a few times this year.</p>
    <p>MR HARIDASS VANKADASAL­AM,</p>
    <p>Boxes of freshly baked fes­tive cook­ies were de­liv­ered to the doorsteps of res­i­dents of one-room rental flats in Choa Chu Kang yes­ter­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dent Sal­biah Ya­cob, 87, whose late hus­band was Pun­jabi, said that re­ceiv­ing the pineap­ple tarts, suji cook­ies and other treats at this time of the year re­minded her of when she cel­e­brated Deep­avali with him years ago.</p>
    <p>Madam Sal­biah was among 200 in­di­vid­u­als and fam­i­lies who re­ceived the good­ies that were meant for them to en­joy as they ring in the fes­tive spirit of Deep­avali, which falls on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>By Nov 15, nearly 2,250 low-in­come fam­i­lies is­land­wide will re­ceive fes­tive cook­ies as part of an ini­tia­tive by the Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion In­dian Ac­tiv­ity Ex­ec­u­tive Com­mit­tees Coun­cil (Narpani Pear­a­vai), which started dis­tribut­ing the baked goods to house­holds last Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The Malay Ac­tiv­ity Ex­ec­u­tive Com­mit­tees Coun­cil is sup­port­ing the ini­tia­tive as well.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, vol­un­teers from both coun­cils and their youth sub-com­mit­tees were joined by Mr Don Wee – MP for Chua Chu Kang GRC’s Brick­land ward – who dis­trib­uted the cook­ies to house­holds in Block 813A Choa Chu Kang Av­enue 7.</p>
    <p>Mr Wee said: “Through this, we can ap­pre­ci­ate each other’s cul­tures, and see how we can col­lab­o­rate to up­lift the lives of the un­der­priv­i­leged, to re­main an in­clu­sive and com­pas­sion­ate so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>Block 813A res­i­dent Haridass Vankadasal­am, 70, said the baked good­ies brought some light to an other­wise bleak year for him.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously a track-and-field coach in an in­ter­na­tional school, he lost his job early this year ow­ing to the pan­demic. He was also start­ing to have knee prob­lems.</p>
    <p>He switched to the se­cu­rity field, but works in­fre­quently be­cause of his grow­ing knee pain.</p>
    <p>“I had to ask my sis­ters to sup­port me fi­nan­cially a few times this year,” said Mr Vankadasal­am, who lives alone.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore In­dian Devel­op­ment As­so­ci­a­tion (Sinda), along with its group of se­nior In­dian busi­ness lead­ers, yes­ter­day com­pleted its dis­tri­bu­tion of gift packs to about 200 low-in­come In­dian fam­i­lies is­land­wide. The gift packs con­tained per­son­alised Deep­avali greet­ing cards and cook­ies.</p>
    <p>In the same vein of spread­ing fes­tive cheer, Narpani Pear­a­vai and the Hindu En­dow­ments Board will be send­ing In­dian veg­e­tar­ian meals and mu­rukku mix­ture snacks to about 400 low-in­come fam­i­lies in 11 neigh­boura for­mer track-and-field coach in an in­ter­na­tional school who lost his job early this year ow­ing to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>hoods to­day. The neigh­bour­hoods in­clude Ke­bun Baru, Boon Lay and Telok Blan­gah.</p>
    <p>This cooked-meals ini­tia­tive is part of a monthly ef­fort by both or­gan­i­sa­tions to reach out to fam­i­lies who have been af­fected fi­nan­cially by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Sinda’s chief ex­ec­u­tive An­barasu Ra­jen­dran said the pan­demic has made things tougher for low-in­come fam­i­lies, and many have ap­proached the self-help group for as­sis­tance with mat­ters such as fi­nan­cial aid, job se­cu­rity and adapt­ing to home-based learn­ing.</p>
    <p>“Fac­ing these chal­lenges in un­cer­tain times has also af­fected the men­tal health of many within our com­mu­nity. The Sinda fam­ily ser­vice cen­tre has seen an in­creased num­ber of clients this year,” said Mr Ra­jen­dran.</p>
    <p>Sinda has set aside $7 mil­lion in fi­nan­cial aid for use till the end of the year to fur­ther help those ad­versely af­fected by the eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion, through schemes such as in­creased bur­saries, cash pay­outs and trans­port vouch­ers.</p>
