    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • The Philadel­phia 76ers were not a team known for three-point­ers. They en­tered their Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) game on Thurs­day 27th in the league in three-point ac­cu­racy.</p>
    <p>But that changed when they made eight of their first 12 at­tempts from be­yond the arc and built a first-half lead as big as 37 points.</p>
    <p>Joel Em­biid scored 21 points and grabbed nine re­bounds, Seth Curry also scored 21 points and the vis­it­ing Six­ers crushed the pre­vi­ously un­de­feated Or­lando Magic 116-92.</p>
    <p>Curry made five three-point­ers and Philadel­phia con­verted a sea­son-high 15 of 33 at­tempts from long range (45.5 per cent).</p>
    <p>“Tonight, we did a good job of mov­ing that ball around and mix­ing it up with three-point shots off the dou­ble teams and driv­ing the bas­ket­ball,’’ said Curry.</p>
    <p>“We know we have a lot of po­ten­tial and ways to grow, but to be 4-1 al­ready is good.”</p>
    <p>To­bias Har­ris had 20 points and nine re­bounds while Shake Mil­ton scored 14 points for the Six­ers, who won their se­cond in a row.</p>
    <p>The 15 three-point­ers in­cluded one from Ben Sim­mons, who drained just the third of his ca­reer. He fin­ished with nine points, 10 re­bounds and eight as­sists.</p>
    <p>Nikola Vuce­vic led the Magic with 19 points and 10 re­bounds, while rookie Cole An­thony added 16 points. Or­lando, who played their fifth game of the sea­son, be­came the last team in the league to lose.</p>
    <p>Evan Fournier, who scored in dou­ble fig­ures in the past four games, had three first-quar­ter points in eight min­utes for the Magic be­fore leav­ing with back spasms. He did not re­turn af­ter that.</p>
    <p>With­out Fournier, the t eam strug­gled to find their of­fen­sive rhythm and trailed 75-40 at half­time. It was the Six­ers’ fourth-big­gest half-time lead in fran­chise his­tory.</p>
    <p>Em­biid paced the Six­ers with 16 points be­fore the break, and Philadel­phia were 10 of 17 from long dis­tance in the open­ing 24 min­utes.</p>
    <p>The Magic, mean­while, missed 14 of their 17 first-half shots from be­yond the arc.</p>
    <p>“We’re not putting enough into guard­ing the ball and help­ing. We’re not,’’ Or­lando coach Steve Clif­ford said on ESPN.</p>
    <p>“Things that we’ve been very good at for two years we’re not do­ing, and that’s the hard things.”</p>
