    <p>As the roll-out of vac­cines sig­nals a light at the end of the pan­demic tun­nel, a “new deal” for South-east Asia’s in­for­mal work­ers which ex­pands safety nets and for­gives sur­vival debt is needed to en­sure a ro­bust and fair re­gional eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>As gov­ern­ments have re­sponded to eco­nomic wipe-outs, many for­mal sec­tor busi­nesses within South-east Asia have ben­e­fited from stim­u­lus pack­ages.</p>
    <p>Yet, ca­sual, con­tract and in­for­mal labour­ers, in­clud­ing street ven­dors, couri­ers, mi­grant labour­ers or lo­cal sup­pli­ers for gar­ment fac­to­ries, have of­ten fallen be­tween the cracks.</p>
    <p>In­for­mal work­ers com­prise around 60 per cent of the re­gional work­force and they have lit­tle ac­cess to un­em­ploy­ment in­sur­ance, med­i­cal leave or health in­sur­ance from their em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>Most in­stead rely on of­ten patchy gov­ern­ment so­cial schemes and sup­port, which</p>
    <p>Asean gov­ern­ments have ex­panded lit­tle dur­ing 2020 – spend­ing around 1 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct on av­er­age on Covid-19 so­cial stim­u­lus com­pared with more than 16 per cent in Europe.</p>
    <p>House­holds that rely on the in­for­mal sec­tor have thus faced a ter­ri­ble choice through­out the pan­demic: go hun­gry or take on new debt to sur­vive.</p>
    <p>Many house­holds across Asean have been do­ing both. In Thai­land, al­ready dire house­hold debt has wors­ened con­sid­er­ably, with scores re­sort­ing to bor­row­ing from loan sharks. In In­done­sia, the down­turn is driv­ing mil­lions of peo­ple back into poverty and push­ing many into deeper debt. In Myan­mar, 80 per cent of house­holds in re­cent sur­veys say they have re­duced meals while more than half have taken new debt to pay for food and sur­vival.</p>
    <p>House­hold sur­vival debt poses a threat both to eco­nomic re­cov­ery and sta­bil­ity as it feeds a phe­nom­e­non econ­o­mists have termed “in­debted de­mand”: Peo­ple who take high-in­ter­est loans to sur­vive Covid-19 must re­pay them be­fore they can make dis­cre­tionary pur­chases or re­build their busi­nesses, de­lay­ing macroe­co­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Re­cent modelling on Asia by the In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund sug­gests house­hold debt could hold back post-pan­demic bounce more than cor­po­rate debt. Mean­while, a re­cent anal­y­sis by the Asian Devel­op­ment Bank sug­gests pri­vate debt is a stronger driver of eco­nomic volatil­ity than gov­ern­ment debt.</p>
    <p>Given that many Asian coun­tries al­ready saw ma­jor spikes in house­hold debt af­ter the 2008 global fi­nan­cial cri­sis, the ac­crual of sur­vival debt across Asean could sup­press growth and in­crease fi­nan­cial volatil­ity in the years ahead.</p>
    <p>BOLD EF­FORTS FOR RE­COV­ERY</p>
    <p>De­spite these risks, Asean’s re­cov­ery strat­egy has not yet pri­ori­tised the prob­lem of house­hold in­debt­ed­ness. The re­cent Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship “mega” trade deal, for in­stance, low­ers tar­iffs in the hope of stim­u­lat­ing in­dus­try growth.</p>
    <p>Yet, for re­cov­ery to be ro­bust and fair, bold ef­forts must be taken to ex­pand so­cial safety nets for Asean’s work­ers – both for­mal and in­for­mal – who have car­ried the re­gion through the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>There are po­lit­i­cal risks to let­ting in­for­mal sec­tor work­ers fall be­tween the cracks. The Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis of 1997/1998, which was driven partly by mount­ing pri­vate in­debt­ed­ness, pro­voked a re­gion­wide pop­u­lar backlash against es­tab­lished po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic elites.</p>
    <p>More than two decades on and anger is grow­ing about the vul­ner­a­bil­ity many work­ers face. In In­done­sia, tens of thou­sands of work­ers took to the streets in Oc­to­ber to protest against re­gres­sive labour laws de­signed to re­strict the rights of work­ers tech­ni­cally em­ployed in the for­mal sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a re­mark­able protest move­ment against Thai­land’s es­tab­lished or­der and grow­ing in­equal­ity has taken shape. Sim­i­lar pop­u­lar resur­gences are fore­see­able across the re­gion, es­pe­cially given that so many in­for­mal work­ers are ex­cluded from Covid-19 stim­u­lus spend­ing.</p>
    <p>To avert fi­nan­cial and po­lit­i­cal in­sta­bil­ity, a “new deal” is needed to struc­turally re­duce house­hold in­debt­ed­ness, es­pe­cially for peo­ple em­ployed in the in­for­mal sec­tor. The World Bank fore­casts that 38 mil­lion peo­ple across East Asia and the Pa­cific will fall be­low the poverty line as a re­sult of the pan­demic and expects re­cov­ery to pre-pan­demic growth lev­els to take a decade or more.</p>
    <p>To build back bet­ter and en­sure a ro­bust and fair re­cov­ery, in­vest­ments in job cre­ation must be cou­pled with struc­tural im­prove­ments to so­cial safety nets and re­duce house­hold sur­vival debt.</p>
    <p>So­cial spend­ing has so far been a small part of Asian pan­demic stim­u­lus. This is not sur­pris­ing, given South-east Asia’s pref­er­ence to spend on “pro­duc­tive” sec­tors such as ed­u­ca­tion and health rather than so­cial pro­tec­tion. Yet, given the bar­ri­ers pri­vate in­debt­ed­ness poses to eco­nomic re­cov­ery and sta­bil­ity, a new ap­proach is needed.</p>
    <p>Through­out the pan­demic, gov­ern­ments around the world, in­clud­ing in Asean, have ex­tended the gen­eros­ity and reg­u­lar­ity of so­cial pay­ments to peo­ple al­ready reg­is­tered to re­ceive sup­port due to poverty, dis­abil­ity, old age or fol­low­ing child­birth.</p>
    <p>Yet, the num­ber of house­holds re­ceiv­ing and fully us­ing these schemes has ex­panded very lit­tle due to con­straints both of re­sourc­ing and tar­get­ing, de­spite mil­lions falling fur­ther into poverty.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia’s largest scheme, for ex­am­ple, was slated to grow from 9.2 mil­lion to 10 mil­lion re­cip­i­ents over the past year – an im­pres­sive ex­pan­sion in a pan­demic con­text but ob­jec­tively in­suf­fi­cient given that an ad­di­tional five mil­lion or so peo­ple are pro­jected to fall be­low the poverty line as a re­sult of the pan­demic down­turn.</p>
    <p>RE­DUC­ING IN­DEBT­ED­NESS</p>
    <p>Plans must be drawn up to ex­pand both the mag­ni­tude and breadth of so­cial schemes to en­sure house­holds are not go­ing into dire debt to pay for so­cial ba­sics like health­care or sus­tain­ing the el­derly in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>To make these plans fair, ac­tion on the spend­ing side – for ex­am­ple, boost­ing pub­lic health fund­ing – must be linked to pro­gres­sive rev­enue mea­sures that do not see the poor sim­ply pay­ing more con­sump­tion tax.</p>
    <p>To re­duce the risks of house­hold in­debt­ed­ness, gov­ern­ments should also take ac­tion to ab­solve those who have ac­crued sur­vival debt. Debt ju­bilees of this kind have bib­li­cal ori­gins; in Old Tes­ta­ment law, ev­ery 50 years, trum­pets were to be blown and all per­sonal debts can­celled to mark the Year of the Lord. Re­searchers of the an­cient Near East sug­gest these amnesties ac­tu­ally did oc­cur as they were of­ten used by new kings to pre­vent debt bondage among their sub­jects and dis­cour­age debt-re­lated flight to other king­doms – mea­sures which en­sured a loyal pop­u­lace and a sta­ble labour force.</p>
    <p>Debt ju­bilees have also been used in more mod­ern times, in­clud­ing to ease the pres­sure on heav­ily in­debted In­dian farm­ers fol­low­ing a rash of sui­cides in the wake of the 2008 fi­nan­cial cri­sis. Stud­ies of In­dian farm­ers who re­ceived these debt waivers found that for­give­ness sig­nif­i­cantly low­ered the rate of later de­fault among in­debted house­holds.</p>
    <p>This sug­gests tar­geted loan re­lief, funded ei­ther by gov­ern­ments, loans from in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions or by cred­i­tors them­selves, can be im­ple­mented fol­low­ing eco­nomic disas­ters while avoid­ing sys­temic moral haz­ards.</p>
    <p>Mi­cro-fi­nance in­sti­tu­tions (MFIs), which lend to mil­lions of peo­ple across Asean, have al­ready been de­fer­ring pay­ments or restruc­tur­ing loans through­out the pan­demic, ac­cord­ing to the Con­sul­ta­tive Group to As­sist the Poor, a global MFI al­liance that is ded­i­cated to ex­pand­ing ac­cess to fi­nance for poor peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Yet, with­out gov­ern­ment lead­er­ship across Asean, few lenders – for­mal or in­for­mal – are go­ing to write off debt en­tirely.</p>
    <p>In the months ahead, South-east Asian gov­ern­ments and or­gan­i­sa­tions need to as­sess the depth of house­hold sur­vival debt across the re­gion and price the risks it poses to re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>The eco­nomic, po­lit­i­cal and so­cial div­i­dends of debt amnesties and more com­pre­hen­sive safety nets may far ex­ceed the sys­temic risks house­hold in­debt­ed­ness could pose to eco­nomic and so­cial sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Given how much cheaper it is for gov­ern­ments to bor­row than house­holds, ex­pand­ing state so­cial schemes and for­giv­ing sur­vival debt must be on the ta­ble if Asean is to chart a path to­wards ro­bust post-pan­demic re­cov­ery.</p>
