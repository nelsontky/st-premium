    <p>NEW YORK • A new Tay­lor Swift al­bum usu­ally ar­rives with a months-long mar­ket­ing roll­out: ra­dio sin­gles, cor­po­rate tie-ins, a string of me­dia ap­pear­ances – all care­fully chore­ographed to send her to No. 1.</p>
    <p>For her lat­est re­lease, Folk­lore, Swift (left) threw out al­most her en­tire play­book, yet still rock­eted to the top with sales that most artists can only dream of. Folk­lore, which came out on July 24 with less than 24 hours’ no­tice, opened at No. 1 on Bill­board’s lat­est al­bum chart with a whop­ping 846,000 sales in the United States, ac­cord­ing to Nielsen Mu­sic.</p>
    <p>That is the third-high­est weekly to­tal for any al­bum in four years, beaten only by Swift’s last two al­bums: Rep­u­ta­tion (1.2 mil­lion in 2017) and Lover (867,000 last year).</p>
    <p>By com­par­i­son, Cana­dian rap­per Drake’s Scor­pion, a mon­ster stream­ing hit, opened with the equiv­a­lent of 732,000 sales i n 2018, while Amer­i­can rap­per Ken­drick La­mar’s Damn notched 603,000 the year be­fore that.</p>
    <p>Sell­ing more than one mil­lion copies in a sin­gle week – once a Swift spe­cial­ity – may no longer be pos­si­ble in the stream­ing era, but through canny mar­ket­ing, the 30-year-old singer-song­writer has kept her num­bers as high as al­most any­one can.</p>
    <p>Folk­lore may also be one of the last block­buster re­leases to take full ad­van­tage of one of Nielsen and Bill­board’s most con­tested rules, over the so-called bundling of al­bums – sell­ing a copy of an al­bum along with an­other item, such as mer­chan­dise or a con­cert ticket. Bill­board is set to stop count­ing most of these deals in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>When her al­bum was an­nounced, Swift’s web­site was fully primed to de­liver her al­bum bun­dled with an ar­ray of deals for items such as a US$49 (S$67) cardi­gan and a US$15 phone stand.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, Swift sold 17 phys­i­cal ver­sions of Folk­lore – eight CDs, eight LPs and a cas­sette tape – that surely lured l arge num­bers of col­lec­tors and fans. Her 846,000 sales to­tal is a com­pos­ite num­ber that in­cludes 615,000 copies sold as a full al­bum.</p>
    <p>Yet, her sur­prise re­lease strat­egy brought its own mo­men­tum and in the days af­ter its re­lease, it was a le­git­i­mate sen­sa­tion on­line – as well as a crit­ics’ favourite, for the most part – that drew 290 mil­lion streams. The Folk­lore sin­gle, Cardi­gan, also de­buted at No. 1 on Hot 100.</p>
    <p>Swift man­aged to avoid one piece of po­ten­tial com­pe­ti­tion in her open­ing week.</p>
    <p>Rap­per Kanye West, her eter­nal celebrity neme­sis, had an­nounced a new al­bum, Donda: With Child, for the same day, but so far, it has not ma­te­ri­alised.</p>
