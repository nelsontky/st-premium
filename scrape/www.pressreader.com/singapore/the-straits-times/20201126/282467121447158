    <p>TURIN • Al­varo Mo­rata said he “got lucky” af­ter he grabbed a late win­ner as Ju­ven­tus qual­i­fied for the Cham­pi­ons League last 16 with a 2-1 vic­tory over Ferenc­varos on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Myrto Uzuni had given the Hun­gar­i­ans a shock lead in the Group G clash in Italy, only for Cris­tiano Ron­aldo to ri­fle in the equaliser for his first Cham­pi­ons League goal this sea­son, ex­tend­ing his record to 131 goals in the com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>Mo­rata came off the bench to seal vic­tory two min­utes into stop­page time with his fifth group­stage goal this term as the hosts seek their first Euro­pean Cup win since 1996.</p>
    <p>“To­day, I think I was lucky on the goal, but no one re­mem­bers luck, ev­ery­one re­mem­bers the goal and that’s it,” said the Spain striker. “It was a com­pli­cated game, that’s how it is in the Cham­pi­ons League now.”</p>
    <p>An­drea Pirlo has achieved his first ob­jec­tive as Ju­ven­tus coach, hav­ing taken over from Mau­r­izio Sarri, who was fired af­ter the Ital­ian side crashed out in the last 16 to Lyon last sea­son.</p>
    <p>“Our goal was to start the match with a dif­fer­ent at­ti­tude but when you play these ap­par­ently sim­ple games, you run into dif­fi­cul­ties,” he said. “Our game was too slow. We didn’t press hard, af­ter many matches, it’s also nor­mal not to have the same in­ten­sity.</p>
    <p>“The lads were good at re­act­ing and try­ing to win un­til the end. We got the re­sult, that’s the im­por­tant thing.”</p>
    <p>Prais­ing Matthijs de Ligt, who made just his sec­ond ap­pear­ance of the sea­son af­ter un­der­go­ing shoul­der surgery in Au­gust, Pirlo added: “He’s a cham­pion, al­ready a cap­tain de­spite be­ing in his early 20s. His is an im­por­tant come­back.”</p>
    <p>Fel­low Group G side Barcelona also clinched their spot in the knock­out phase with a 4-0 win away to Dy­namo Kiev.</p>
    <p>Coach Ron­ald Koe­man, who is un­der pres­sure af­ter a poor start in La Liga, made eight changes from the team who were beaten 1-0 by Atletico Madrid on Saturday and left all-time top scorer and cap­tain Lionel Messi back home.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the squad ro­ta­tion worked as the vis­i­tors had more im­pe­tus. A brace from Martin</p>
    <p>Braith­waite, Sergino Dest’s maiden strike since ar­riv­ing from Ajax in the sum­mer, and a late goal by sub­sti­tute An­toine Griez­mann sealed the win.</p>
    <p>“Some games turn out bet­ter than oth­ers but the big­gest dif­fer­ence to­day was how fresh we looked,” Koe­man said.</p>
    <p>“We did the right thing in rest­ing some play­ers and giv­ing an op­por­tu­nity to oth­ers who were in a bet­ter phys­i­cal shape. We were much bet­ter in mid­field, we showed lots of hunger and pressed our op­po­nents very well.”</p>
    <p>With lead­ers Barca three points ahead of Juve (nine), top spot will likely be de­cided when both sides clash in the group’s fi­nal fix­ture at the Nou Camp next month.</p>
