    <p>Wired to thrive amid change, techno­preneur and pri­vate eq­uity in­vestor Loke Wai San has what it takes to stay re­silient, even through dark days.</p>
    <p>“One thing you re­alise over the years is that noth­ing usu­ally goes ac­cord­ing to plan,” said Mr Loke, the ex­ec­u­tive chair­man of AEM Hold­ings, which de­signs and man­u­fac­tures semi­con­duc­tor test han­dlers.</p>
    <p>“When that hap­pens, the abil­ity to sit back, re­assess the sit­u­a­tion and pivot be­comes in­valu­able.”</p>
    <p>Back in 2011, Mr Loke, founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of Sin­ga­pore­based pri­vate eq­uity fund ad­viser Novo Tel­lus Cap­i­tal Part­ners, parachuted into AEM as an in­vestor and was forced to hone his pivot skills in the days that fol­lowed.</p>
    <p>AEM, which had been placed on the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX) watch list in 2010, then had two main busi­nesses – a sub­strates unit in the red and an equip­ment di­vi­sion that was still afloat.</p>
    <p>The com­pany was gen­er­at­ing cash, but was sad­dled with losses.</p>
    <p>“We re­ceived a US$20 mil­lion in­vest­ment to de­velop our strug­gling sub­strates busi­ness, which ap­peared to be a god­send, but un­for­tu­nately, that life­line didn’t pan out,” he re­called, re­fer­ring to Sil­i­con­ware Pre­ci­sion In­dus­tries’ 2012 eq­uity in­vest­ment in MCT, AEM’s sub­strates sub­sidiary.</p>
    <p>Although AEM ex­ited the watch list that same year, the MCT di­vi­sion con­tin­ued to in­cur op­er­at­ing losses. Two years later, AEM bit the bul­let and sold off the unit.</p>
    <p>“We were then left with the equip­ment di­vi­sion, which also needed to be re­set,” said Mr Loke, 52.</p>
    <p>Things were stormy in 2013 and 2014, but AEM had a strong man­age­ment team who shared a sin­gle vi­sion.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieved what we were work­ing on was revo­lu­tion­ary and would dis­rupt the way semi­con­duc­tor test­ing was car­ried out,” said Mr Loke, who has more than 25 years of global tech­nol­ogy man­age­ment and in­vest­ment ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>“Es­sen­tially, semi­con­duc­tor test­ing has not changed over the last 25 years – chips are get­ting more and more com­plex, but test­ing pro­ce­dures have re­mained static. Play­ing a part in rewrit­ing how semi­con­duc­tors can be tested in fu­ture – that means a lot to me, and the team.”</p>
    <p>Mr Loke, who has a Bach­e­lor of Sci­ence in elec­tri­cal and elec­tron­ics en­gi­neer­ing from Le­high Univer­sity in Penn­syl­va­nia and a Mas­ter of Busi­ness Ad­min­is­tra­tion from The Univer­sity of Chicago, was ap­pointed ex­ec­u­tive chair­man in 2017.</p>
    <p>DRIVEN BY IN­NO­VA­TION</p>
    <p>He had spent eight years of his ca­reer in Sil­i­con Val­ley do­ing earlystage in­vest­ing, so he placed a pre­mium on in­no­va­tion. In the early days, AEM was an au­to­ma­tion house, fo­cus­ing on sys­tems in­te­gra­tion and con­tract man­u­fac­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>“Since 2011, we’ve in­vested sub­stan­tially in our en­gi­neer­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties, from R&D (re­search and de­vel­op­ment) to man­u­fac­tur­ing and field ser­vice sup­port. This en­abled us to grow glob­ally and be­come a full-fledged prod­uct en­gi­neer­ing firm,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We also ex­panded our R&D reper­toire be­yond me­chan­i­cal en­gi­neer­ing to in­clude elec­tri­cal, elec­tron­ics and soft­ware. Where the gaps were sig­nif­i­cant, we made ac­qui­si­tions.”</p>
    <p>AEM listed on the SGX main­board in De­cem­ber 2000. It is now a leader in ap­pli­ca­tion-spe­cific in­tel­li­gent sys­tem test and han­dling so­lu­tions for semi­con­duc­tor and elec­tron­ics com­pa­nies, serv­ing the ad­vanced com­put­ing, 5G and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) mar­kets.</p>
    <p>The group has five plants – in Sin­ga­pore, Pe­nang, Suzhou in China, Fin­land and France. R&D is car­ried out here, and in France and Fin­land.</p>
    <p>AEM re­ported a 57.5 per cent yearon-year surge in net profit to $52.8 mil­lion for last year, with rev­enue up 23.2 per cent to $323.1 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The strong per­for­mance ex­tended into the first quar­ter ended</p>
    <p>March 31, with sales nearly tripling to a record $146.8 mil­lion and net profit jump­ing more than five­fold to $36.1 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>AEM has raised its rev­enue guid­ance to $430 mil­lion to $445 mil­lion for the full year, which would mean an­other record per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>Some of the world’s largest global semi­con­duc­tor man­u­fac­tur­ers num­ber among AEM’s cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Although no names have been of­fi­cially dis­closed by the com­pany, an­a­lysts have named United States chip gi­ant In­tel as a key client that ac­counts for more than 90 per cent of its rev­enue.</p>
    <p>“If we can de­liver com­plex chip so­lu­tions for the big boys, it al­most in­stantly qual­i­fies us for other cus­tomers,” Mr Loke added. “If you can climb Mount Ever­est, you won’t have a prob­lem scal­ing Bukit Timah Hill.”</p>
    <p>While AEM ac­knowl­edges the risks of de­riv­ing the bulk of its sales from one key cus­tomer, it has also high­lighted that this sup­plier-client re­la­tion­ship is into its 19th year.</p>
    <p>At the same time, over the last three years, AEM has ac­quired four com­pa­nies to ex­pand its range.</p>
    <p>In March, it com­pleted the ac­qui­si­tion of France’s Mu-Test. Dur­ing the first three months of 2018, it bought Sin­ga­pore-based In­spiRain Tech­nolo­gies and Iris Solution, and Fin­land’s Afore Oy.</p>
    <p>“Our ac­qui­si­tions fo­cus on fore­see­able fu­ture ar­eas of growth, such as test and man­age­ment so­lu­tions for IoT (In­ter­net of Things), AI, cloud and data cen­tres, as well as elec­tric ve­hi­cles and 5G in­fra­struc­ture,” Mr Loke said.</p>
    <p>The strong bal­ance sheet, with zero bor­row­ings, pro­vides fi­nan­cial flex­i­bil­ity to pur­sue these goals. As of Dec 31 last year, AEM’s cash and cash equiv­a­lents stood at $107.7 mil­lion, up 82.8 per cent year on year.</p>
    <p>AEM’s fu­ture will be driven by ex­po­nen­tial growth in in­te­grated cir­cuits, as de­mand moves from con­sumer ap­pli­ca­tions such as lap­tops and smart­phones into in­fra­struc­ture and au­to­mo­biles.</p>
    <p>“With stronger de­mand for chips, which will in­crease in com­plex­ity, test­ing needs will cor­re­spond­ingly es­ca­late,” Mr Loke noted.</p>
    <p>STRONG VI­SION</p>
    <p>Play­ing a part in rewrit­ing how semi­con­duc­tors can be tested in fu­ture – that means a lot to me, and the team.</p>

    <p>AEM Hold­ings team shares a sin­gle vi­sion for the com­pany.</p>
