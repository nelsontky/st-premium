    <p>Af­ter the cir­cuit breaker ended on June 1, more pa­tients have come for­ward to seek help for their hear­ing loss.</p>
    <p>Seek­ing early treat­ment for hear­ing loss is ad­van­ta­geous as it gets more chal­leng­ing to adapt to hear­ing aids the longer one has lived with un­treated hear­ing loss.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, an el­derly gen­tle­man came to see me. He was ac­com­pa­nied by his son, who asked: “Doc­tor, can you per­suade my dad to wear a hear­ing aid? He has de­men­tia and it is get­ting harder to look af­ter him as he also can­not hear.”</p>
    <p>Upon check­ing his fa­ther’s med­i­cal records, I re­alised the se­nior had con­sulted us 15 years ago, when he al­ready had sig­nif­i­cant hear­ing loss, but was cog­ni­tively in­tact.</p>
    <p>Like many pa­tients, he had re­fused to wear a hear­ing aid.</p>
    <p>The pa­tient’s son ex­plained that he had al­ready bought two pairs of hear­ing aids in the past 18 months, but that his fa­ther sim­ply re­fuses to wear them.</p>
    <p>I pa­tiently ex­plained to him the im­mense chal­lenges in try­ing to get pa­tients who have de­men­tia to start wear­ing a hear­ing aid for the first time. This is be­cause cog­ni­tive re­serves are needed for pa­tients to adapt to their new hear­ing aids.</p>
    <p>I was then asked if there is any link be­tween de­men­tia and hear­ing loss.</p>
    <p>A 2011 study by Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity in the United States had mon­i­tored more than 600 adults over 12 years; and iden­ti­fied hear­ing loss as an im­por­tant risk fac­tor of de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>Af­ter fac­tor­ing in other risks, pa­tients with hear­ing loss were two to five times more likely to de­velop de­men­tia, de­pend­ing on the sever­ity of their hear­ing prob­lem.</p>
    <p>Other stud­ies, in­clud­ing one from Singapore, also ar­rived at a sim­i­lar con­clu­sion.</p>
    <p>There are three the­o­ries that might be able to ex­plain the link be­tween hear­ing loss and de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>First, cer­tain diseases (for ex­am­ple, those that cause the nar­row­ing of blood ves­sels) can ac­cel­er­ate both cog­ni­tive de­cline and hear­ing loss.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, the in­creased cog­ni­tive re­sources di­verted to­wards un­der­stand­ing what one is hear­ing can re­sult in less cog­ni­tive re­serves be­ing avail­able for mem­ory and other men­tal func­tions.</p>
    <p>Last, hear­ing loss re­sults in so­cial iso­la­tion, which is a risk fac­tor of de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>A com­pre­hen­sive re­view of de­men­tia re­search pub­lished in The Lancet (among the high­est-ranked aca­demic med­i­cal jour­nals) in 2017 iden­ti­fied hear­ing loss as the sec­ond most im­por­tant mod­i­fi­able risk fac­tor of de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>The first be­ing early child­hood ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Hear­ing loss can usu­ally be treated once di­ag­nosed. How­ever, one will not be able to travel back in time to im­prove one’s early child­hood ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>This study es­ti­mated that 25 per cent of de­men­tia cases might be pre­vented from treat­ing hear­ing loss.</p>
    <p>When the son heard that, he con­fessed to hav­ing hear­ing loss him­self. He is in his 50s and asked if he could pre­vent de­men­tia in the fu­ture by wear­ing a hear­ing aid now.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, there is a lack of qual­ity re­search to pro­vide a de­fin­i­tive an­swer to this ques­tion, likely due to eth­i­cal con­sid­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Such ran­domised clin­i­cal tri­als would en­tail “flip­ping a coin” for a large num­ber of peo­ple with hear­ing loss to ei­ther re­ceive or not to re­ceive hear­ing aids over an ex­tended pe­riod while mon­i­tor­ing for the on­set of de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>I re­as­sured him that should he de­velop de­men­tia later on, he could still hear well if he starts us­ing a hear­ing aid now.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) has clas­si­fied de­men­tia as a ma­jor pub­lic health prob­lem that has a pro­found im­pact on our lives.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, the num­ber of peo­ple with de­men­tia will triple to</p>
    <p>150 mil­lion by 2050; with the eco­nomic bur­den to so­ci­ety ris­ing to US$2 tril­lion (S$2.73 tril­lion) by 2030.</p>
    <p>To­day, one in 10 Sin­ga­pore­ans over the age of 60 has de­men­tia. Singapore is age­ing fast.</p>
    <p>By 2050, half its pop­u­la­tion will be above 65 years old, with an es­ti­mated 250,000 peo­ple with de­men­tia liv­ing in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>The WHO also recog­nised that hear­ing loss is a ma­jor pub­lic health con­cern, with 5 per cent of the cur­rent global pop­u­la­tion suf­fer­ing from hear­ing loss that is se­vere enough to cause dis­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>By 2050, one in 10 peo­ple, or</p>
    <p>900 mil­lion, will have dis­abling hear­ing loss. In­deed, the 2017 Global Bur­den of Dis­ease study has iden­ti­fied hear­ing loss as the third lead­ing cause of dis­abil­ity world­wide.</p>
    <p>The 2010 Singapore Na­tional Health Sur­vey found that 3 per cent of the coun­try’s adult pop­u­la­tion have dis­abling hear­ing loss. This rises rapidly to 10 per cent for those aged 60 to 69.</p>
    <p>Yet, over­all, only 3 per cent of Sin­ga­pore­ans with dis­abling hear­ing loss use hear­ing aids. Fur­ther stud­ies also con­firmed that they would wait un­til their hear­ing loss is ad­vanced be­fore seek­ing help.</p>
    <p>As Singapore rides the Sil­ver Tsunami, it is im­por­tant to pre­vent and man­age de­men­tia and hear­ing loss.</p>
    <p>The fo­cus of health­care is shift­ing to­wards healthy life ex­pectancy, away from life ex­pectancy alone.</p>
    <p>Early di­ag­no­sis and treat­ment of hear­ing loss can help pre­serve our so­cial, com­mu­ni­ca­tion and men­tal func­tions, and help trans­form our sil­ver years into golden ones.</p>
    <p>Hear­ing loss is not only harder to treat in some­one who al­ready has de­men­tia, but is also a sig­nif­i­cant risk fac­tor of de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>It is al­ways best to get help early.</p>
