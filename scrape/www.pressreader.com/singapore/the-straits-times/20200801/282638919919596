    <p>I am try­ing to im­prove the fuel ef­fi­ciency of my three-year-old hatch­back. Which of these fac­tors has the big­gest in­flu­ence on ef­fi­ciency – weight, tyre pres­sure or driv­ing style?</p>
    <p>There are fac­tors other than the three you men­tioned which will af­fect ef­fi­ciency.</p>
    <p>But as­sum­ing your car is well-main­tained and the wheels are prop­erly aligned, these three are prob­a­bly the most sig­nif­i­cant ones.</p>
    <p>And be­cause they are linked to be­hav­iour, they can be as easy or as dif­fi­cult to cor­rect.</p>
    <p>For weight, the big­gest de­ter­mi­nant would be the num­ber of peo­ple you carry, which is of­ten some­thing you can­not con­trol.</p>
    <p>What is within your con­trol, how­ever, is what you carry in your car boot. But un­less you have a bath­tub back there, a boot full of spare cloth­ing and shoes or tools is not go­ing to in­flu­ence fuel econ­omy very much.</p>
    <p>Tyre pres­sure has a big­ger in­flu­ence. In my ex­pe­ri­ence, ev­ery 20 per cent in­crease in in­fla­tion trans­lates to an im­prove­ment of around 3 per cent in ef­fi­ciency.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, if tyres are un­der-in­flated, you can ex­pect fuel econ­omy to drop by the same quan­tum.</p>
    <p>Per­son­ally, I pre­fer a higher-than-rec­om­mended pres­sure. It af­fects com­fort a lit­tle, but I get bet­ter fuel econ­omy and han­dling. I would not go be­yond 20 per cent above the rec­om­mended pres­sure though. And if you are trav­el­ling long dis­tances at higher speeds – to Malaysia for in­stance – it is best to stick to the rec­om­mended pres­sure.</p>
    <p>Mon­i­tor­ing tyre pres­sure is not some­thing we do nat­u­rally, so it takes some dis­ci­pline to check each time you fill up.</p>
    <p>Next, driv­ing style. This un­doubt­edly has the big­gest in­flu­ence on fuel con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>In the city, ob­serv­ing traf­fic and ter­rain helps you reg­u­late throt­tle pres­sure.</p>
    <p>Al­low the car to coast as much as pos­si­ble (while in gear, of course) and avoid hard ac­cel­er­a­tion be­cause it will in­vari­ably be fol­lowed by hard brak­ing. These two acts alone will re­sult in wasted en­ergy.</p>
    <p>Even if you are driv­ing an elec­tri­fied car, which is able to re­cap­ture some of the en­ergy lost to brak­ing, a smooth driv­ing style is more ef­fi­cient than a fast and fu­ri­ous one.</p>
    <p>Fre­quently, mo­torists here brake un­nec­es­sar­ily when they ap­proach a turn. If you an­tic­i­pate a turn, there is rarely a need to brake. A well-judged coast to a cor­ner will al­low you to ne­go­ti­ate the turn safely. And if you are al­ready at crawl­ing speed, there is no need to de­press the brake pedal be­fore turn­ing.</p>
    <p>Adopt­ing an ef­fi­cient driv­ing style usu­ally means a safe driv­ing style. Both re­quire alert­ness and a keen aware­ness of what goes on around you.</p>
