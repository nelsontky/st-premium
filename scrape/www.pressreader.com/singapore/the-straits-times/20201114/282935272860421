    <p>TOKYO • Ja­panese mu­sic en­thu­si­asts, loyal to CDs long af­ter the rest of the world went on­line, have be­gun reach­ing for the eject but­ton and switch­ing to stream­ing ser­vices as artists can­cel in-store events and fans stay home be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>De­spite a slow de­cline in sales in the past decade, CDs are still the most-pop­u­lar mu­sic for­mat in Ja­pan, ac­count­ing for about 70 per cent of recorded mu­sic sales last year.</p>
    <p>In the United States and Euro­pean mar­kets, CDs have long been rel­e­gated to the his­tory bin in favour of on­line down­loads and, re­cently, stream­ing.</p>
    <p>Stream­ing ser­vices, which had ac­counted for less than 10 per cent of sales in Ja­pan un­til a few years ago, grew to 15 per cent last year and will likely ex­ceed 20 per cent this year, said Mr Jamie MacEwan, who cov­ers the Ja­panese me­dia busi­ness for anal­y­sis firm En­ders Anal­y­sis.</p>
    <p>The shift is closely watched by the global mu­sic in­dus­try be­cause Ja­pan is the world’s sec­ond-big­gest mu­sic mar­ket af­ter the US, worth nearly US$3 bil­lion (S$4.05 bil­lion) an­nu­ally.</p>
    <p>“The cross­over point where to­tal dig­i­tal rev­enues eclipse phys­i­cal pro­duc­tion is now just a mat­ter of time,” Mr MacEwan said.</p>
    <p>Be­yond hurt­ing CD re­tail­ers like Tower Records, still a big pres­ence in Ja­pan, the shift may also sig­nal more growth for stream­ing ser­vices such as Ama­zon and Spo­tify, which en­tered Ja­pan only four years ago, as well as smaller do­mes­tic ri­vals.</p>
    <p>Tower Records Ja­pan, which runs more than 80 stores in the coun­try, would not re­lease data, but said it has suf­fered a se­ri­ous slump since the pan­demic as con­sumers avoided go­ing out and artists can­celled new re­leases along with events to pro­mote them.</p>
    <p>“It will take a long time for things to re­turn to nor­mal,”said Mr Tat­suro Ya­gawa, a spokesman for the stores, which be­came in­de­pen­dent from the now-bank­rupt US chain af­ter a 2002 man­age­ment buy­out. Still, he was op­ti­mistic about a re­turn.</p>
    <p>“Mu­sic fans here like buy­ing CDs to show sup­port for their favourite artists. I don’t think peo­ple will stop buy­ing CDs, ” he said.</p>
    <p>One ma­jor rea­son CDs have re­mained so pop­u­lar in Ja­pan has been that record la­bels of­ten bun­dle CD sin­gles and al­bums with perks for pop-idol fans, in­clud­ing vouch­ers for pri­or­ity con­cert ticket pur­chases and in­vi­ta­tions to hand­shake events.</p>
    <p>Such events and con­certs have mostly been can­celled or scaled down in re­cent months be­cause of the pan­demic, with some mov­ing on­line.</p>
    <p>Avex, Ja­pan’s big­gest listed mu­sic la­bel and en­ter­tain­ment group, held its an­nual mu­sic fes­ti­val on­line in Au­gust for the first time.</p>
    <p>Fea­tur­ing acts in­clud­ing vet­eran singer Ayumi Ha­masaki and K-pop group Red Vel­vet, the event at­tracted 1.6 mil­lion views in­clud­ing free and pay-per-view spots – a rare bit of cheer for a busi­ness hit by plung­ing sales.</p>
    <p>But Avex chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Kat­sumi Kuroiwa, talk­ing to in­vestors last Fri­day af­ter the com­pany re­ported losses for its fis­cal first-half, de­scribed the fi­nan­cial re­sults of its foray into largescale on­line events as mixed.</p>
    <p>On the one hand, he said, Avex learnt it could at­tract huge au­di­ences on­line, but on the other, tick­ets had to be priced much lower than phys­i­cal events – a predica­ment it will grap­ple with as it seeks to live-stream more events.</p>
    <p>So far, CD sales have been but­tressed by a lack of new hits on stream­ing ser­vices as record com­pa­nies seek to avoid can­ni­bal­is­ing phys­i­cal sales.</p>
    <p>But this, too, is seen chang­ing as CD sales de­cline and record com­pa­nies recog­nise money shift­ing to stream­ing. Re­cent chart-hit­ting sin­gles by singer-song­writer Ken­shi Yonezu and vet­eran boy band Arashi are avail­able on Spo­tify.</p>
    <p>“Do­mes­tic la­bels are likely to make more of their cat­a­logues avail­able to stream closer to the phys­i­cal re­lease, which will ac­cel­er­ate the dig­i­tal tran­si­tion in the com­ing years,” Mr MacEwan said.</p>
    <p>But he also said that un­like in other mar­kets where Spo­tify and Ap­ple Mu­sic are the main stream­ing ser­vices, lo­cal Ja­panese stream­ing ser­vices such as Line Mu­sic, Avex’s AWA and Re­coChoku may have an ad­van­tage by of­fer­ing live stream­ing and other con­tent aimed at J-pop fans.</p>
    <p>“This will pre­vent the emer­gence of an Ap­ple-Spo­tify du­op­oly as seen else­where,” Mr MacEwan said.</p>
