    <p>View­ers who have seen both the 2008 hit lo­cal drama The Lit­tle Ny­onya and the 2020 Chi­nese re­make are likely to no­tice a dif­fer­ence in the por­trayal of the pro­tag­o­nist Yue­ni­ang be­tween the two shows.</p>
    <p>This time round, the char­ac­ter, played by rookie Chi­nese ac­tress Xiao Yan, is a lot less pas­sive. Sin­ga­porean ac­tress Jeanette Aw played the part 12 years ago.</p>
    <p>This was a de­lib­er­ate de­ci­sion by the pro­duc­ers, who wanted to make her a bet­ter role model for mod­ern fe­male au­di­ences, says Mr Chen Xiao, se­nior vice-pres­i­dent of pro­duc­tion com­pany and stream­ing plat­form iQiyi, where The Lit­tle Ny­onya is stream­ing.</p>
    <p>He told The Straits Times over the phone in Man­darin: “Yue­ni­ang goes through all sorts of tragedy and the orig­i­nal ver­sion painted her as a very pas­sive char­ac­ter.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to make her more in con­trol of some of her de­ci­sions in the new ver­sion, so that young women who watch the show can em­pathise with her and feel like they can also cre­ate a bet­ter life for them­selves.”</p>
    <p>Yue­ni­ang, a young Per­anakan woman, also comes across as more youth­ful in the re­make.</p>
    <p>Mr Chen ex­plains: “These were con­sid­er­a­tions to make the series feel more mod­ern, even though it is still a pe­riod piece. We wanted to make a show that would res­onate bet­ter with au­di­ences to­day.”</p>
    <p>Xiao’s age – she is 23 – also con­trib­utes to her char­ac­ter’s youth­ful vibe. Aw was 29 when she played the role.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate in­ter­view with The Straits Times, Chi­nese ac­tor Dai Xiangyu, 35, who plays the same role of a Ja­panese pho­tog­ra­pher who mar­ried Jux­i­ang (Yue­ni­ang’s mother) in both series, said: “Jeanette was a bit older than Xiao when she acted in the series so her char­ac­ter showed more life ex­pe­ri­ence, whereas Xiao is more in­no­cent and cute in her por­trayal.” The roles of Jux­i­ang and Yue­ni­ang are both played by Xiao.</p>
    <p>Mostly though, the re­make stays true to the orig­i­nal, says Mr Chen.</p>
    <p>Span­ning sev­eral decades from the 1930s, The Lit­tle Ny­onya re­volves around the life of Yue­ni­ang, who, de­spite be­ing mis­treated by her own fam­ily, re­mains kind and shows re­silience.</p>
    <p>Mr Chen says: “The orig­i­nal is, after all, a beloved series and many view­ers in China had seen it and were fans of it as well.</p>
    <p>“The story is so rich, we didn’t want to change that too much. It is not easy to do re­makes, but we felt that peo­ple would still be drawn to this story.”</p>
    <p>He was right. The 45-episode re­make, which has many episodes filmed in Malaysia for au­then­tic “Nanyang flavour”, is a hit in China, top­ping rat­ings and In­ter­net search rank­ings charts.</p>
    <p>In the last two weeks of its broad­cast, which ended on July 13, the show was the most-watched drama in the coun­try, ac­cord­ing to me­dia anal­y­sis firm CSM.</p>
    <p>On pop­u­lar video stream­ing app Douyin, the show was also the No. 1 trend­ing search term on the night the fi­nale aired.</p>
    <p>“Be­yond the char­ac­ters and the plot, view­ers in China also loved the Per­anakan el­e­ments,” Mr Chen says.</p>
    <p>He notes that the pro­duc­ers had put in a lot of ef­fort to en­sure the cos­tumes and sets looked au­then­tic and hired ex­perts to teach the cast mem­bers about the cul­ture.</p>
    <p>It will not be the last time a Sin­ga­pore story is re­told for Chi­nese au­di­ences.</p>
    <p>iQiyi and China-backed home­grown pro­duc­tion out­fit GHY Cul­ture And Me­dia – which col­lab­o­rated on The Lit­tle Ny­onya – are work­ing on a re­make of the 1984 clas­sic The Awak­en­ing.</p>
    <p>The orig­i­nal, which starred the late vet­eran ac­tor Huang Weny­ong, is about the lives of a group of first­gen­er­a­tion Chi­nese im­mi­grants in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple will al­ways want to watch good sto­ries,” says Mr Chen.</p>
    <p>• The Lit­tle Ny­onya is avail­able on iQiyi (www.iq.com).</p>
