    <p>There were 63 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed as of noon yes­ter­day, tak­ing Singapore’s to­tal to 57,229.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health (MOH) also an­nounced two new Covid-19 clus­ters in dor­mi­to­ries yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 26 newly con­firmed cases were linked to nine pre­vi­ous cases to form a new clus­ter at Avery Lodge Dor­mi­tory in the Jurong area.</p>
    <p>Eight pa­tients that were ear­lier con­firmed were also linked to form a new clus­ter at PPT Lodge 1A in Sele­tar North, said MOH.</p>
    <p>The new cases an­nounced yes­ter­day in­cluded two com­mu­nity cases, com­pris­ing a Sin­ga­porean and a work per­mit holder.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean, a 36-year-old man, was linked to three pre­vi­ous im­ported cases who are his fam­ily mem­bers. They had re­turned from In­dia on Aug 24, and were placed on stay-home no­tices at a ded­i­cated fa­cil­ity upon ar­rival in Singapore.</p>
    <p>While the man had not trav­elled over­seas with them, he re­quested to take care of his spouse and young chil­dren at the quar­an­tine fa­cil­ity, and was iso­lated with them from Aug 24, said MOH.</p>
    <p>The other case in the com­mu­nity, a 33-year-old Chi­nese na­tional, was un­linked to other pa­tients as of yes­ter­day. He was de­tected as a re­sult of ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of work­ers in the con­struc­tion, ma­rine and process sec­tors who stay out­side dor­mi­to­ries. This was even though he did not show symp­toms.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, six new im­ported cases were an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Among them is a Sin­ga­porean who re­turned to Singapore from the United Arab Emi­rates on Aug 29.</p>
    <p>Four of them are work­ers cur­rently em­ployed here. One is a work pass holder who ar­rived from Bangladesh on Aug 31, while another work pass holder ar­rived from Rus­sia on Aug 29. Two work per­mit hold­ers ar­rived from In­done­sia on Aug 29.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing im­ported pa­tient is a stu­dent’s pass holder who ar­rived from the Philip­pines on Aug 27.</p>
    <p>All of them were placed on 14-day stay-home no­tices upon ar­rival in Singapore, and were tested while serv­ing their no­tices at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>One new lo­ca­tion was added to the list of places vis­ited by in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Yaleju-Tong Bei Huo Guo, a restau­rant at 149 Gey­lang Road, was vis­ited by at least one pa­tient be­tween 10am and 12.05pm on Aug 30, said MOH.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 55 new coro­n­avirus pa­tients an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from three cases two weeks ago to two in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has also de­creased from a daily av­er­age of two cases to one over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 66 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 56,543 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 47 pa­tients re­mained in hos­pi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 597 were re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Singapore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
