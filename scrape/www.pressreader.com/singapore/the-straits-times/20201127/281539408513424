    <p>Malaysian Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s first fed­eral bud­get sur­vived a Par­lia­ment vote yes­ter­day, en­sur­ing his ad­min­is­tra­tion’s con­tin­ued sur­vival de­spite its slim ma­jor­ity and chal­lenges from al­lies and ri­vals alike. At RM322.5 bil­lion (S$106 bil­lion), the bud­get will be Malaysia’s big­gest to date.</p>
    <p>Malaysian Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s first fed­eral bud­get sur­vived a Par­lia­ment vote yes­ter­day, en­sur­ing his ad­min­is­tra­tion’s con­tin­ued sur­vival de­spite its slim ma­jor­ity and chal­lenges from al­lies and ri­vals alike.</p>
    <p>Bud­get 2021 was sur­pris­ingly passed by a voice vote at its sec­ond read­ing in Par­lia­ment, with the op­po­si­tion fail­ing to muster the 15 law­mak­ers nec­es­sary to re­quest bloc vot­ing. The Bill will now move to a three-week-long com­mit­tee stage of de­bates be­fore a third and fi­nal read­ing is ap­proved.</p>
    <p>At RM322.5 bil­lion ($106 bil­lion), the bud­get will be Malaysia’s big­gest to date.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s Perikatan Na­sional (PN) coali­tion had just 113 MPs – one more than the 112 needed for a sim­ple ma­jor­ity – when he first pre­sented the ex­pan­sion­ary bud­get ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>The spend­ing plan had drawn crit­i­cism even from his govern­ment ally Barisan Na­sional (BN), which holds the most num­ber of seats in PN.</p>
    <p>How­ever, BN law­mak­ers unan­i­mously backed the Bill yes­ter­day, af­ter weeks of sug­gest­ing that their sup­port would de­pend on cer­tain de­mands be­ing met.</p>
    <p>Some of these de­mands, as well as re­quests from op­po­si­tion MPs, were ac­com­mo­dated, Fi­nance Min­is­ter Tengku Zafrul Aziz said yes­ter­day as he an­nounced sev­eral changes to the bud­get.</p>
    <p>These in­cluded en­hanc­ing mea­sures to tackle the economic fall­out from the coronaviru­s pan­demic such as mak­ing more peo­ple and busi­nesses eli­gi­ble for loan re­pay­ment ex­emp­tions and with­drawals from the state pen­sion fund. More funds will also be al­lo­cated for front-line work­ers and Sabah state, one of the worstaf­fected by the virus.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Zafrul also an­nounced that the RM85.5 mil­lion orig­i­nally al­lo­cated for a re­vived govern­ment pro­pa­ganda unit would be re­duced, af­ter MPs from both sides of the aisle slammed it as a mis­placed pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din yes­ter­day thanked law­mak­ers who sup­ported the Bill, es­pe­cially those from his PN coali­tion. He noted in his state­ment that the eleventh hour changes to the bud­get showed that the PN govern­ment was “open to dif­fer­ent opinions and crit­i­cisms”.</p>
    <p>De­spite spend­ing past weeks sound­ing their dis­plea­sure over the bud­get, most op­po­si­tion MPs chose not to ob­ject to it or even force a bloc vot­ing process, which means count­ing votes for and against the Bill.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s pro­ceed­ings also dis­played dis­so­nance within the 108-strong op­po­si­tion bloc. For­mer prime min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad, who heads Parti Pe­juang Tanah Air, was among 13 MPs who sup­ported the re­quest for a bloc vote.</p>
    <p>He was joined by a few law­mak­ers from Parti Amanah Ne­gara, which is a mem­ber of the Pakatan Hara­pan coali­tion led by Datuk Seri An­war Ibrahim. The other two par­ties in PH, Mr An­war’s Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat and the Demo­cratic Action Party, opted not to force a bloc vote. The two par­ties have 80 MPs be­tween them.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din last month sought an emer­gency dec­la­ra­tion from the King, which would have al­lowed him to by­pass par­lia­men­tary ap­proval for the bud­get and avoid a snap elec­tion if he lost the vote. The King re­jected the pro­posal, but urged all law­mak­ers to pass the bud­get to help the govern­ment weather the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Royal Palace yes­ter­day thanked law­mak­ers who it said “sup­ported His Majesty’s ad­vice” by help­ing the bud­get’s pas­sage.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin has emerged tri­umphant af­ter the much-an­tic­i­pated show­down in Malaysia’s Par­lia­ment over his bud­get failed to ma­te­ri­alise yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>No law­mak­ers de­fected from Umno, the largest party in his Perikatan Na­sional (PN) pact, as had been widely spec­u­lated. And op­po­si­tion MPs barely raised a whim­per when the Bill was ap­proved in a sim­ple voice vote.</p>
    <p>Yet his cel­e­bra­tion is likely to be short-lived, as both friend and foe con­tinue deal-mak­ing for power in the “new nor­mal” of the coun­try’s pol­i­tics. “The win shows how dif­fi­cult it is for Umno to break ranks. But dis­senters may still find rea­son to ob­ject to spe­cific items in the bud­get, and ob­struct the third read­ing. Po­lit­i­cal un­cer­tainty is not over in Malaysia,” Bow­erGroupAsi­a’s po­lit­i­cal risk an­a­lyst Adib Zalka­pli told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment must now nav­i­gate the mine­field of the com­mit­tee stage de­bates – where each min­istry’s al­lo­ca­tion must be in­di­vid­u­ally ap­proved – for three weeks, begin­ning on Monday, be­fore these cul­mi­nate in a vote for a third and fi­nal read­ing set for mid-De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>Still, the win is a huge boost for Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia chief Muhyid­din, un­der­lin­ing how the King’s en­dorse­ment re­mains a po­tent ob­sta­cle for those plan­ning to oust his slim-ma­jor­ity govern­ment by de­feat­ing the bud­get Bill. Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah had urged all law­mak­ers to back the bud­get, to en­sure the fight against a resur­gent coronaviru­s out­break is not dis­rupted.</p>
    <p>Even if politi­cians obey the King’s ad­vice, the in­tense machi­na­tions and deal-mak­ing that have be­come the norm since the shock end to Umno’s six-decade rule at the 2018 polls are set to re­sume in the new year.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Muhyid­din is barely hold­ing on to a ma­jor­ity, with just the needed min­i­mum of 112 MPs. And Umno, his largest ally with 38 law­mak­ers, con­tin­ues to threaten to with­draw its sup­port. It is a mat­ter of when, not if, Mr Muhyid­din’s ten­u­ous grip on the 222-seat Par­lia­ment will come un­der as­sault again.</p>
    <p>The likes of Umno pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi and his pre­de­ces­sor, for­mer premier Na­jib Razak, con­tinue to flirt with mov­ing their sup­port­ers over to back op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim in­stead, much to the dis­may of oth­ers in the party and other PN al­lies.</p>
    <p>But Datuk Seri An­war con­tin­ues to strug­gle with the task of re­unit­ing his own Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) pact.</p>
    <p>Months of dis­agree­ments over po­lit­i­cal strat­egy cul­mi­nated in the in­de­ci­sive­ness at yes­ter­day’s bud­get vote, where mem­bers of his coali­tion – which has 91 MPs – were split on whether to call for a bloc vote and risk look­ing like they were de­fy­ing the King.</p>
    <p>While his own Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat and largest ally Demo­cratic Action Party (DAP) voiced “nays” against the Bill, they did not stand up to sup­port Parti Amanah Ne­gara vice-pres­i­dent Mah­fuz Omar’s re­quest for a bal­lot. In­stead, Amanah MPs were joined by those from Parti Pe­juang Tanah Air, the party helmed by Mr An­war’s ri­val, Tun Dr Ma­hathir Mo­hamad. Only 13 op­po­si­tion MPs stood up, short of the 15 needed to force a bloc vote.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war has in­sisted the move was tac­ti­cal, to give the Cabi­net ev­ery chance of rec­ti­fy­ing short­com­ings in the bud­get, as well as to al­lay fears among the pub­lic of a govern­ment shut­down should the sec­ond read­ing of the Sup­ply Bill be de­feated.</p>
    <p>But al­ready, sev­eral DAP law­mak­ers have taken to so­cial me­dia to clar­ify that they do op­pose the bud­get, and were merely abid­ing by the PH lead­er­ship’s de­ci­sion not to force a bal­lot.</p>
    <p>For­mer premier Ma­hathir also lam­basted op­po­si­tion col­leagues who sat on their hands, ac­cus­ing them of sup­port­ing “a cor­rupt govern­ment... with­out a shred of guilt for break­ing their prom­ise to the pub­lic”.</p>
    <p>For now, these sorts of schisms work in Mr Muhyid­din’s favour. He may be balanc­ing on the high wire, but his ri­vals have not yet man­aged to band to­gether to shake him off.</p>
