    <p>LON­DON • Jude Bellingham is ex­pected to earn his first cap for Eng­land as the Three Lions take on Ire­land in a friendly at Wem­b­ley to­day.</p>
    <p>The 17-year-old has en­joyed a me­te­oric rise since mak­ing the jump from Cham­pi­onship side Birm­ing­ham to Ger­man Bun­desliga out­fit Borus­sia Dort­mund in the sum­mer for an ini­tial £25 mil­lion (S$44.8 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>Bellingham re­ceived his maiden call-up ear­lier this week and mul­ti­ple Bri­tish me­dia re­ports have said he is set to be re­warded for his club form with his first ap­pear­ance in Eng­land colours.</p>
    <p>If he fea­tures to­day, he will be­come the Three Lions’ thirdy­oungest player af­ter Theo Wal­cott (17 years 75 days) and Wayne Rooney (17 years 111 days).</p>
    <p>But that will not faze the mid­fielder, who has al­ready made big de­ci­sions de­spite mak­ing his pro de­but only last sea­son.</p>
    <p>He turned down the over­tures of Manch­ester United to move to Ger­many and has set­tled quickly.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, he be­came the club’s youngest goalscorer, break­ing Nuri Sahin’s record by six days and last month, he be­came the youngest English­man to start a Cham­pi­ons League game to sur­pass the mark pre­vi­ously set by Manch­ester City’s Phil Foden.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, Bellingham told reporters he had no re­grets turn­ing down United as “the way Dort­mund in­te­grate young play­ers into the first-team squad is next level”.</p>
    <p>As­ton Villa de­fender Ty­rone</p>
    <p>Jude Bellingham will be third-youngest player af­ter Theo Wal­cott and Wayne Rooney to fea­ture for Eng­land if he makes his de­but to­day.</p>
    <p>Mings, who is part of Gareth South­gate’s squad, also feels he was jus­ti­fied in choos­ing to link up with Eng­land for­ward Jadon San­cho, 20, at Dort­mund in­stead.</p>
    <p>“I have had the op­por­tu­nity to see him in train­ing over the past cou­ple of days, and what a fan­tas­tic ta­lent he looks,” he said on Tues­day. “I know he is from the blue side of Birm­ing­ham, but I have got no prob­lem in ad­mit­ting what a fan­tas­tic player he is and what a fan­tas­tic lad he seems.</p>
    <p>“For some­one who has achieved so much in such a short space of time, he seems to be very grounded and hum­ble. It is a huge oc­ca­sion for him, and fair play to him.”</p>
