    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has put an end to the spe­cial sta­tus ac­corded to Hong Kong by his coun­try. He has also signed a Bill that would sanc­tion Chi­nese of­fi­cials crack­ing down on po­lit­i­cal dis­sent in the city, while Bei­jing has vowed to im­pose re­tal­ia­tory sanc­tions. Hong Kong cor­re­spon­dent Claire Huang ex­plains what this means.</p>
    <p>Q What’s so unique about</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s spe­cial sta­tus?</p>
    <p>A Un­der the US-Hong Kong Pol­icy Act of 1992, the US gives pref­er­en­tial treat­ment to Hong Kong in trade and eco­nomic re­la­tions, as long as the city re­mains “suf­fi­ciently au­ton­o­mous” from the main­land.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong has en­joyed such sep­a­rate and spe­cial treat­ment since the 1997 han­dover by Bri­tain to China, on the ba­sis that Bei­jing prac­tises the “one coun­try, two sys­tems” model, which was agreed to by China and guar­an­teed a high de­gree of free­dom for Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Q What does treat­ing Hong Kong as sep­a­rate from the main­land mean?</p>
    <p>A Hong Kong is not sub­ject to rules ap­plied to the main­land.</p>
    <p>Q How ex­ten­sive could the im­pact be?</p>
    <p>A Pre­vi­ously, as a sep­a­rate Cus­toms ter­ri­tory for im­ports into the US, Hong Kong was not sub­ject to tar­iffs placed on China, in­clud­ing the wide-rang­ing Sec­tion 301 tar­iffs on about US$370 bil­lion (S$514 bil­lion) of Chi­nese goods now in place.</p>
    <p>In the past, un­der the Ex­port Ad­min­is­tra­tion Reg­u­la­tions and In­ter­na­tional Traf­fic in Arms Reg­u­la­tions, ex­ports like goods, soft­ware and tech­nol­ogy to Hong Kong re­ceived favourable treat­ment.</p>
    <p>These will now be sub­ject to more re­stric­tive con­trols. Some ex­ports will im­me­di­ately re­quire li­cens­ing and cer­tain ex­ports re­lat­ing to mil­i­tary or satel­lite items will be strictly pro­hib­ited.</p>
    <p>In terms of US im­mi­gra­tion pol­icy, Hong Kong pass­port hold­ers will no longer be treated any dif­fer­ently from China pass­port hold­ers.</p>
    <p>The US will also sus­pend the ex­tra­di­tion agree­ment it has with Hong Kong, as well as end train­ing of mem­bers of the Hong Kong Po­lice Force or se­cu­rity ser­vices at the US Depart­ment of State’s In­ter­na­tional Law En­force­ment Academies.</p>
    <p>The im­pact spills over into the aca­demic world as the US sus­pends co­op­er­a­tion with the Chi­nese Univer­sity of Hong Kong in earth sci­ences re­search and ends the Ful­bright ex­change pro­gramme with both China and Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Q What is the Hong Kong Au­ton­omy Act?</p>
    <p>A On July 2, the US Congress passed the Hong Kong Au­ton­omy Act which al­lows manda­tory sanc­tions against in­di­vid­u­als, en­ti­ties and fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions said to be be­hind China’s new na­tional se­cu­rity law for Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Q What can the Hong Kong Au­ton­omy Act do?</p>
    <p>A The Hong Kong Au­ton­omy Act lists po­ten­tial sanc­tions such as: re­fusal of credit from any US in­sti­tu­tion; pro­hi­bi­tion from act­ing as a pri­mary dealer in US debt; a ban from act­ing as an agent of the US gov­ern­ment for US pub­lic funds; a ban on for­eign ex­change trans­ac­tions; a ban on the fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion en­ter­ing into trans­ac­tions with other fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions; a ban on the fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion from hold­ing, us­ing or deal­ing with any prop­erty; no ex­port of com­modi­ties or soft­ware to the fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion; and not al­low­ing any US per­son from in­vest­ing in eq­uity or debt of the fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>These are all sub­ject to the reach of US ju­ris­dic­tion.</p>
    <p>The sanc­tions ex­clude of­fi­cers or con­trol­ling share­hold­ers from the US but al­low the gov­ern­ment to im­pose them on in­di­vid­ual of­fi­cers of the fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>Q What is the po­ten­tial dam­age?</p>
    <p>A Iden­ti­fied in­di­vid­u­als may be banned from en­ter­ing the US.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness or deal­ings with peo­ple des­ig­nated as a US sanc­tions tar­get will also be af­fected. For in­stance, an im­me­di­ate as­set freeze will ex­pose all as­sets the in­di­vid­ual has in­ter­ests in and can se­verely limit op­tions for di­vest­ment or ex­its from fi­nan­cial re­la­tion­ships.</p>
    <p>Q What is the United States’ stake in Hong Kong?</p>
    <p>A Hong Kong was the source of the largest bi­lat­eral US goods trade sur­plus last year, at US$26.1 bil­lion, and is a huge mar­ket for US le­gal and ac­count­ing busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>The US State Depart­ment says 85,000 US cit­i­zens lived in Hong Kong in 2018 and more than 1,300 US com­pa­nies op­er­ate in the city, in­clud­ing nearly every ma­jor US fi­nan­cial firm. More than 1,300 US firms have offices there.</p>
