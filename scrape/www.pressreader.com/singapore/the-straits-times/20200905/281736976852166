    <p>Day in the life of a dig­i­tally savvy Ah Ma</p>
    <p>In a Man­darin speech, Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion Sim Ann imag­ined a day in the life of a dig­i­tally savvy se­nior, which she said could be “any Ah Ma in the neigh­bour­hood”.</p>
    <p>In the morn­ing, she checks the Trans­port.SG app to find out when her bus will ar­rive. She sends a selfie to her fam­ily What­sApp chat group, uses PayNow to buy gro­ceries and picks up pre­scrip­tion med­i­ca­tion from a parcel locker.</p>
    <p>The Ah Ma does not stop there – she watches videos on YouTube, re­ports stag­nant wa­ter on the OneSer­vice app, tracks her daily step count with the Health Pro­mo­tion Board’s Healthy365 app, reads enews­pa­pers on the Na­tional Li­brary Board app and uses SingPass Mo­bile to check in to a shop­ping mall with SafeEn­try.</p>
    <p>More se­niors will be able to en­joy such con­ve­niences with the help of the Se­niors Go Dig­i­tal move­ment, Ms Sim said.</p>
    <p>2 Give de­liv­ery rid­ers grace pe­riod for park­ing</p>
    <p>First-time MP Hany Soh (Mar­sil­ing-Yew Tee GRC) re­vealed that she had paid a visit to Foodpanda de­liv­ery rider Ab­dul Rah­man, who was filmed wav­ing to by­standers from his mo­tor­cy­cle from the back of a mo­bile col­umn dur­ing the Na­tional Day Pa­rade last month. The video was widely shared.</p>
    <p>She said Mr Rah­man, a res­i­dent in her Wood­grove ward, shared with her some of the dif­fi­cul­ties faced by de­liv­ery rid­ers like him­self, in­clud­ing the oc­ca­sional fine im­posed by the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity or shop­ping mall man­age­ment for park­ing of­fences.</p>
    <p>Ms Soh sug­gested a “tran­si­tional park­ing” 15-minute grace pe­riod for food de­liv­ery rid­ers be im­ple­mented and that shop­ping malls pro­vide des­ig­nated food de­liv­ery pick-up points.</p>
    <p>“This will pro­vide a win-win sit­u­a­tion that re­duces the risk of fines and clamp­ing charges for il­le­gal park­ing, en­abling a smoother food col­lec­tion and de­liv­ery process.”</p>
    <p>3 MPs come to grips with new pro­cesses</p>
    <p>The first ses­sion of ques­tion time in the new term of Par­lia­ment saw MPs get­ting used to pro­cesses old and new.</p>
    <p>New MP Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio GRC) read out her par­lia­men­tary ques­tion for Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo in full, which prompted Speaker Tan Chuan-Jin to re­mind MPs to sim­ply state their ques­tion num­ber.</p>
    <p>When Mr Louis Ng (Nee Soon GRC) stepped up to the podium to ask Mrs Teo a ques­tion, he stood di­rectly across her, sep­a­rated only by the clear per­spex screen put in place as a safety mea­sure against Covid-19. MPs usu­ally speak from mi­cro­phones near their seats, but now have to speak from the podium as their seats do not have the clear screens. Mr Tan quipped that their con­ver­sa­tion “seems very in­ti­mate with you stand­ing there”, prompt­ing laugh­ter from the House.</p>
    <p>The Speaker also re­minded MPs to keep their sup­ple­men­tary ques­tions brief and “cut the pream­ble”.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>Tan See Leng’s ex­change with WP’s Gerald Giam</p>
    <p>A speech from Work­ers’ Party MP Gerald Giam (Alju­nied GRC) on pro­tect­ing for­eign worker in­ter­ests prompted a re­sponse from Se­cond Man­power Min­is­ter Tan See Leng.</p>
    <p>There are mul­ti­ple mech­a­nisms to pro­tect the work­ers’ wel­fare, said Dr Tan, who is also Se­cond Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try. But he noted that the Gov­ern­ment has no ju­ris­dic­tion over em­ploy­ment agen­cies in the work­ers’ home coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan also thanked Mr Giam for sug­gest­ing a por­tal for em­ploy­ers to list avail­able jobs so work­ers do not have to go through in­ter­me­di­aries to find new work once their con­tracts end. He said: “If you have more ideas, this is con­struc­tive feed­back, we would wel­come them as well.”</p>
    <p>Mr Giam said he ap­pre­ci­ated the at­ten­tion be­ing paid to the is­sue, and noted he was call­ing for more trans­parency on the part of em­ploy­ers, not the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>Min­is­ters spar with Leong Mun Wai over DBS CEO</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion S. Iswaran yes­ter­day said he was trou­bled by Non-Con­stituency MP Leong Mun Wai’s ex­pres­sion of dis­ap­point­ment at Sin­ga­pore not hav­ing a home­grown chief ex­ec­u­tive at DBS Bank.</p>
    <p>The bank’s CEO Piyush Gupta was born in In­dia and be­came a Sin­ga­porean in 2009.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong had made the re­mark in his maiden speech on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter yes­ter­day urged him to con­sider what mes­sage he was send­ing, es­pe­cially to nat­u­ralised Sin­ga­pore­ans and the world. “We have painstak­ingly built an open and in­clu­sive econ­omy that is able to cre­ate op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans by wel­com­ing com­pet­i­tive en­ter­prises and tal­ent.”</p>
    <p>Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said it would be wrong to set a quota or rule that there “must be a Sin­ga­porean CEO, born here, be­fore we de­clare suc­cess”.</p>
