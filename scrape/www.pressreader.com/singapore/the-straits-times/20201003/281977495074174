    <p>The visit by the US ta­ble tennis team to Bei­jing in April 1971 is widely re­garded as a key turn­ing point in US-China re­la­tions, cul­mi­nat­ing in rap­proche­ment when then US Pres­i­dent Richard Nixon vis­ited the Chi­nese cap­i­tal less than a year later.</p>
    <p>Less widely known, how­ever, is that ping-pong diplo­macy also played a role, that same year, in nascent Sin­ga­pore-China ties when the Re­pub­lic sent a team in Novem­ber to the first Afro-Asian Ta­ble Tennis Friend­ship In­vi­ta­tional Tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>The two coun­tries then had no of­fi­cial ties as China did not recog­nise Sin­ga­pore’s in­de­pen­dence in 1965. But un­of­fi­cially, both sides recog­nised the value of ex­pand­ing com­mer­cial and other ties.</p>
    <p>This was ev­i­dent when, about a fort­night be­fore the pad­dlers com­peted, Sin­ga­pore sent its first of­fi­cial trade mis­sion to China.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s par­tic­i­pa­tion in the tour­na­ment also led to China send­ing its ping-pong team here in 1972, paving the way for other sports and cul­tural ex­changes, like vis­its of China’s ac­ro­batic troupes.</p>
    <p>The mile­stone year also saw the Sin­ga­pore Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion send­ing a high-level team to China.</p>
    <p>Though low-key, these early links demon­strated the prag­matic ap­proach of the two coun­tries in de­vel­op­ing their friend­ship and mu­tual un­der­stand­ing amid the tur­bu­lent times of the Sino-Soviet split and the Viet­nam War.</p>
    <p>Em­i­nent his­to­rian Wang Gungwu noted that Chi­nese Sin­ga­pore­ans, many of them emi­gres, were deeply com­mit­ted to main­tain­ing links with their home towns in China, while China was keen to grow trade and restart its econ­omy.</p>
    <p>By then, the Malayan Com­mu­nist Party had also been de­feated, the Chi­nese were wind­ing down their Cul­tural Rev­o­lu­tion ac­tiv­i­ties, and Sin­ga­pore’s then Prime Min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew was “skil­fully non-com­mu­nist”, said Pro­fes­sor Wang, who is Univer­sity Pro­fes­sor at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore. “Since ev­ery­body ben­e­fited from ex­pand­ing com­mer­cial and fi­nan­cial con­tacts, you could dis­pense with for­mal diplo­matic ties and act prag­matic.”</p>
    <p>Trade fig­ures re­flected this new re­al­ity: In the 10 years from 1965, Sin­ga­pore’s trade with China more than tripled, from $246.9 mil­lion to $786.2 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing also did not for­get Sin­ga­pore’s vote of sup­port that helped China gain a seat at the United Na­tions in Oc­to­ber 1971.</p>
    <p>In 1974, at a pri­vate din­ner in New York, then Chi­nese Vice-Min­is­ter for For­eign Af­fairs Qiao Guan­hua ex­tended an in­vi­ta­tion to Sin­ga­pore’s For­eign Min­is­ter S. Ra­jarat­nam to visit China.</p>
    <p>Mr Ra­jarat­nam’s trail­blaz­ing good­will mis­sion to Bei­jing the fol­low­ing March fos­tered warmer ties even as Sin­ga­pore main­tained its pol­icy of be­ing the last among the found­ing Asean mem­bers to for­malise ties with China – a move to al­lay the fears of its neigh­bours that the Re­pub­lic would be a “third China” as 75 per cent of its pop­u­la­tion was eth­nic Chi­nese.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing’s ma­te­rial sup­port for com­mu­nist move­ments in South-east Asia in the 1950s and 1960s had also made some coun­tries in the re­gion wary of Chi­nese over­tures. In­done­sia, in par­tic­u­lar, had a dif­fi­cult re­la­tion­ship with China. Ties were sev­ered in 1967 af­ter Jakarta ac­cused Bei­jing of com­plic­ity in an abortive com­mu­nist coup at­tempt in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>In a late-evening meet­ing with Mr Ra­jarat­nam dur­ing his China trip, Premier Zhou En­lai said China re­spected Sin­ga­pore’s sovereignt­y, and did not see it as a third China.</p>
    <p>He also told Mr Ra­jarat­nam that while China hoped to es­tab­lish diplo­matic ties with Sin­ga­pore soon, it un­der­stood the sen­si­tiv­i­ties Sin­ga­pore faced and was will­ing to post­pone for­mal re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>The suc­cess of Mr Ra­jarat­nam’s visit laid the ground­work for Prime Min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew to make his maiden trip to China in May 1976.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the two-week trip, Mr Lee held lengthy meet­ings with Premier Hua Guofeng, and had a face-to-face meet­ing with Chair­man Mao Ze­dong de­spite the Great Helms­man’s frail health.</p>
    <p>Vet­eran diplo­mat Tommy Koh, who or­gan­ised Mr Lee’s visit, re­called that the 15-minute meet­ing with Chair­man Mao, although not par­tic­u­larly sub­stan­tive, was still a strong sig­nal from the Chi­nese.</p>
    <p>“It was im­por­tant sym­bol­i­cally: that Mao Ze­dong ap­proved of the visit by Sin­ga­pore, and wanted to have good re­la­tions with Sin­ga­pore,” Pro­fes­sor Koh said in a re­cent in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>The re­cip­ro­cal visit to Sin­ga­pore by para­mount leader Deng Xiaop­ing in 1978 would help cement not just the un­der­ly­ing bi­lat­eral re­la­tion­ship but also a bud­ding per­sonal friend­ship be­tween Mr Lee and Mr Deng.</p>
    <p>Im­pressed by Sin­ga­pore’s gov­er­nance model and the way it had man­aged to at­tract and chan­nel for­eign in­vest­ments, Mr Deng re­turned home with the Re­pub­lic’s for­mula in mind as he de­signed China’s eco­nomic re­forms, which came to be his sig­na­ture re­form and open­ing-up pol­icy.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee re­counted in his mem­oirs that of­fi­cial Chi­nese news cov­er­age of Sin­ga­pore changed af­ter Mr Deng re­turned home. “Sin­ga­pore was de­scribed as a gar­den city worth study­ing for its green­ing, pub­lic hous­ing and tourism. We were no longer ‘run­ning dogs of the Amer­i­can im­pe­ri­al­ists’,” Mr Lee noted, ref­er­enc­ing an ep­i­thet Ra­dio Bei­jing had once used to describe him.</p>
    <p>In the en­su­ing years, of­fi­cial vis­its con­tin­ued apace de­spite the lack of diplo­matic re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee made his sec­ond visit to China, in 1980, while then Premier Zhao Ziyang vis­ited Sin­ga­pore in 1981, af­ter which the two na­tions ex­changed trade rep­re­sen­ta­tives for the first time, with the of­fices serv­ing as de facto em­bassies.</p>
    <p>The breadth of re­la­tions ex­panded into other spheres: In 1985, di­rect air links were es­tab­lished, with the first Sin­ga­pore Air­lines flights to Shang­hai and Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Trade and in­vest­ments con­tin­ued to blos­som: By 1990, two-way trade had reached $5.2 bil­lion, while Sin­ga­pore’s com­pa­nies had di­rectly in­vested more than $1 bil­lion in China.</p>
    <p>Af­ter In­done­sia re­sumed for­mal re­la­tions with China in Au­gust 1990, Sin­ga­pore and China for­malised ties in a sim­ple cer­e­mony at the United Na­tions com­plex in New York on this day, 30 years ago.</p>
    <p>The sub­se­quent years saw Mr Lee main­tain an abid­ing in­ter­est in China that its lead­ers keenly re­cip­ro­cated. He would visit China 33 times over 37 years and meet five gen­er­a­tions of Chi­nese lead­ers, be­com­ing a re­spected el­der to suc­ces­sive groups of po­lit­i­cal lead­ers from both sides.</p>
    <p>These early years of Sin­ga­pore-China re­la­tions still hold valu­able lessons for keep­ing ties on a strong foot­ing, like the value of prag­matic, mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial co­op­er­a­tion in over­com­ing ide­o­log­i­cal hur­dles, said schol­ars of China and Sin­ga­pore-China ties.</p>
    <p>One such les­son is to com­bine the build­ing of per­sonal re­la­tion­ships among lead­ers with strong in­sti­tu­tional frame­works to en­sure con­tin­u­ous part­ner­ship at dif­fer­ent lev­els, said ISEAS – Yu­sof Ishak In­sti­tute se­nior fel­low Lye Liang Fook.</p>
    <p>“An­other key in­gre­di­ent is to be for­ward-look­ing and con­tinue to pur­sue co­op­er­a­tion based on each coun­try’s na­tional in­ter­est,” he said. “Pro­ceed­ing on each other’s na­tional in­ter­est of­fers a good ba­sis to re­view not only ex­ist­ing ar­eas of co­op­er­a­tion, but also to ex­plore new ar­eas of co­op­er­a­tion.”</p>
