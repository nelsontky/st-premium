    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON Over 70 mil­lion Amer­i­cans have cast their bal­lots in the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, more than half the to­tal turnout of the 2016 elec­tion with one week to go un­til Elec­tion Day, a Tues­day tally from the US Elec­tions Project shows.</p>
    <p>The tally, which shows a record­break­ing pace that could lead to the high­est voter turnout in per­cent­age terms in more than a cen­tury, is the lat­est sign of in­tense in­ter­est in the con­test be­tween Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and Demo­cratic chal­lenger Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>It also high­lights vot­ers’ de­sire to re­duce their risk of ex­po­sure to Covid-19 as the pan­demic re­gath­ers strength head­ing into win­ter.</p>
    <p>Democrats hold a sig­nif­i­cant ad­van­tage in early vot­ing due to their em­brace of mail bal­lots, which Repub­li­cans have his­tor­i­cally cast in large num­bers but have shunned amid re­peated and un­founded at­tacks by Mr Trump, who says the sys­tem is prone to wide­spread fraud.</p>
    <p>Over­all, Democrats hold a roughly two-to-one ad­van­tage in early vot­ing num­bers.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Repub­li­cans in re­cent weeks have nar­rowed the gap in early, in-per­son vot­ing, data shows.</p>
    <p>The high level of early vot­ing has led Univer­sity of Florida pro­fes­sor Michael McDon­ald, who ad­min­is­ters the US Elec­tions Project, to pre­dict a record US voter turnout of about 150 mil­lion, rep­re­sent­ing 65 per cent of those el­i­gi­ble to vote, the high­est rate since 1908.</p>
    <p>US vot­ers had al­ready cast far more early votes dur­ing this pres­i­den­tial cam­paign than they did in all of 2016 when they passed the 47 mil­lion mark ear­lier this month, data shows.</p>
    <p>The huge vol­ume of mail bal­lots – more than 46.8 mil­lion have al­ready been cast – could take days or weeks to tally, ex­perts say, mean­ing a win­ner might not be de­clared on the night of Nov 3, when polls close.</p>
