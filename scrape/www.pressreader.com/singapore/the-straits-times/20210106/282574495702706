    <p>Many proud par­ents have been post­ing photos of their child’s first day of school on Mon­day, but ac­tor Christo­pher Lee had to miss that mile­stone for his only child Zed.</p>
    <p>The 49-year-old has been film­ing a drama se­rial, Pur­suers, in Tai­wan for the past three months, but said he was sure his wife Fann Wong, 49, could han­dle the task solo.</p>
    <p>In a phone in­ter­view with Lianhe Wan­bao on Mon­day, he also ex­pressed con­fi­dence in his son’s abil­ity to adapt to a new school.</p>
    <p>“He has been look­ing for­ward to it since the mid­dle of last year and has asked us many ques­tions about school,” he said.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, as par­ents, we still wor­ried if he knew how to take care of him­self in school, if he knew how to buy food, if he could get along with his class­mates,” he added. “But this is part of the process of grow­ing up and he has to fig­ure these things out for him­self.”</p>
    <p>He did get his wife to do a live stream of the first day of school, so he could still be a part of it from afar.</p>
    <p>He also com­forted him­self with the fact that only one par­ent was al­lowed to be present any­way, due to safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>While he did not re­veal which school his son is in due to pri­vacy con­cerns, he said he be­lieves in Sin­ga­pore’s ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem and that choos­ing a school was not a hard de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>He added that he left all the prepa­ra­tion for Pri­mary 1, such as get­ting uni­forms and books ready, to his able wife.</p>
    <p>“She can def­i­nitely han­dle ev­ery­thing. She does it when I’m not around.”</p>
    <p>The cou­ple, who mar­ried in 2009, cel­e­brated their 11th an­niver­sary in Oc­to­ber last year and ded­i­cated ro­man­tic posts to each other on In­sta­gram.</p>
