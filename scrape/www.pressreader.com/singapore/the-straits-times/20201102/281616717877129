    <p>It shouldn’t al­ways be Moshe Safdie’s Ma­rina Bay Sands that gets top billing as an ar­chi­tec­tural icon.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic has its own post-in­de­pen­dence land­marks to boast of, such as Golden Mile Com­plex – a mono­lithic cruise ship per­ma­nently docked at Kal­lang Basin – Ta­man Jurong’s blocks 63 to 66, linked in a strik­ing di­a­mond lay­out, and Peo­ple’s Park Com­plex, which rein­vented Chi­na­town’s en­er­getic public spa­ces within its mas­sive atria.</p>
    <p>Th­ese struc­tures are prod­ucts of their time, and rep­re­sent how the city was built and ur­ban liv­ing con­ceived of by the coun­try’s pi­o­neer­ing plan­ners and ar­chi­tects in the early days of na­tion build­ing.</p>
    <p>Her­itage ad­vo­cates, ar­chi­tects and in­ter­ested mem­bers of the public, there­fore, ap­plauded the au­thor­i­ties’ re­cent pro­posal to con­serve Golden Mile Com­plex.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts said the un­prece­dented move, which in­cludes the of­fer of ad­di­tional plan­ning in­cen­tives for de­vel­op­ers, re­flects po­lit­i­cal com­mit­ment to pro­tect­ing im­por­tant build­ings in the Sin­ga­pore story.</p>
    <p>Golden Mile Com­plex res­i­dent Ponno Kalas­tree, 73, said that while own­ers like him do not have strong feel­ings towards the build­ing, the pro­posal by the au­thor­i­ties gives de­vel­op­ers a strong in­cen­tive to step into the fray.</p>
    <p>“The pro­posal will help us to sell our prop­erty,” he said. “At the same time, Sin­ga­pore­ans can ben­e­fit from the re­ten­tion of an im­por­tant lo­cal land­mark.”</p>
    <p>With the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity now hav­ing made the first move, what should hap­pen next?</p>
    <p>With­out public buy-in, con­ser­va­tion would be a mean­ing­less en­deav­our.</p>
    <p>As a first step, a list of key build­ings from this era should be pub­lished by ex­perts in col­lab­o­ra­tion with the rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties and made avail­able to the public. With­out such recog­ni­tion or watch list, the coun­try’s post-65 gems will re­main un­der­val­ued and un­der­ap­pre­ci­ated, for­ever in the shadow of his­toric na­tional mon­u­ments.</p>
    <p>Se­cond, sto­ries of Sin­ga­pore’s pi­o­neer ar­chi­tects and their tan­gi­ble con­tri­bu­tions to the city’s sky­line should be sys­tem­at­i­cally doc­u­mented and cap­tured be­fore it is too late. Th­ese sto­ries could also be used in lo­cal text­books and serve as the ba­sis of her­itage walks. Mu­se­ums could also run ex­hi­bi­tions on th­ese pi­o­neers.</p>
    <p>Tak­ing a leaf from the books of other coun­tries, Sin­ga­pore could em­bark on a cam­paign to pro­mote lo­cal ar­chi­tec­ture.</p>
    <p>Her­itage con­ser­va­tion spe­cial­ist Ho Weng Hin noted that English Her­itage, a Bri­tish char­ity that man­ages his­toric struc­tures, or­gan­ised a three-year cam­paign in the late 1980s to sur­vey and con­duct out­reach on Eng­land’s post-war her­itage. The pro­gramme fa­cil­i­tated dis­course, he said.</p>
    <p>“Even­tu­ally, a con­sen­sus was reached to pro­tect this as­pect of its iden­tity as a na­tion. This led to a man­date and more mo­ti­va­tion to prop­erly cat­e­gorise, eval­u­ate and even­tu­ally con­serve th­ese build­ings,” he added.</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional Coun­cil on Mon­u­ments and Sites (Sin­ga­pore) pres­i­dent Yeo Kang Shua added that it is timely to cap­i­talise on the travel re­stric­tions as a re­sult of the pan­demic, and cast the spot­light on the lo­cal liv­ing en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>With ed­u­ca­tion, the no­tion that con­ser­va­tion holds back progress can be ques­tioned. Lo­cal de­vel­op­ers can also play a proac­tive role in strik­ing that bal­ance and chart­ing the way for­ward.</p>
    <p>And while the au­thor­i­ties and ex­perts ham­mer out a process to sort out what must stay and what can af­ford to go, it is time we came to­gether as a com­mu­nity to cel­e­brate “lo­cal”.</p>
