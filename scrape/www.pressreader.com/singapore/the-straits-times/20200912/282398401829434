    <p>NEW YORK • Cit­i­group Inc on Thurs­day named con­sumer bank­ing head Jane Fraser to suc­ceed Michael Cor­bat next year as the bank’s chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer, mak­ing her the first wo­man to lead a ma­jor Wall Street bank.</p>
    <p>Ms Fraser, 53, has been a ris­ing star in the fi­nan­cial in­dus­try, with a ca­reer span­ning in­vest­ment bank­ing, wealth man­age­ment, trou­bled mort­gage work­outs and strat­egy in Latin Amer­ica – a key busi­ness for Cit­i­group.</p>
    <p>Her pro­mo­tion to CEO was widely ex­pected since be­ing el­e­vated to Cit­i­group pres­i­dent last year, and was cel­e­brated as a step in the right di­rec­tion for an in­dus­try that has few women or di­verse ex­ec­u­tives in its top ranks.</p>
    <p>“Great news for the com­pany and for women ev­ery­where!” tweeted Bank of Amer­ica Corp op­er­a­tions and tech­nol­ogy chief Cathy Bes­sant. “A big and fan­tas­tic mo­ment.”</p>
    <p>Cit­i­group shares were up 1 per cent in morn­ing trade.</p>
    <p>In­deed, Ms Fraser joins a small group of women who have bro­ken through the glass ceil­ing to reach the C-suite at ma­jor fi­nan­cial firms. In ad­di­tion to Ms Bes­sant, there is Fi­delity In­vest­ments CEO Abi­gail John­son, JPMor­gan’s con­sumer lend­ing head Mar­i­anne Lake and its fi­nance chief Jennifer Piep­szak, and Bri­tish bank NatWest CEO Ali­son Rose.</p>
    <p>Ms Fraser launched her ca­reer at Gold­man Sachs in its mergers and ac­qui­si­tions de­part­ment in Lon­don, and then worked for As­esores Bursátiles in Madrid. She joined Cit­i­group 16 years ago and is cred­ited in­ter­nally with help­ing the bank re­cover af­ter the fi­nan­cial cri­sis, when it had to take US$45 bil­lion (S$61 bil­lion) in tax­payer funds to sur­vive.</p>
    <p>Through the years, she has run client strat­egy in Citi’s in­vest­ment bank, as well as its pri­vate bank, its mort­gage busi­ness and its op­er­a­tions in Latin Amer­ica, which ac­counted for 14 per cent of an­nual rev­enue at the end of last year. Her name was floated last year as a po­ten­tial CEO can­di­date at Wells Fargo and Co, be­fore the board set­tled on former JPMor­gan ex­ec­u­tive Charles Scharf.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber, Ms Fraser was pro­moted to the role of pres­i­dent and tasked to head its global con­sumer bank, a move that was widely seen as a pre­cur­sor to her el­e­va­tion.</p>
    <p>Credit Suisse an­a­lyst Su­san Roth Katzke said the pro­mo­tion came sooner than ex­pected, and that in­vestors are ea­ger to get an au­di­ence with her. “In­vestors will need to hear more from Jane, sooner rather than later,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mr Cor­bat was launched into the CEO role in 2012, when his pre­de­ces­sor sud­denly left un­der pres­sure from in­vestors. Since then, he has shifted Cit­i­group’s strat­egy to fo­cus on cor­po­rate busi­nesses where it has strengths, such as fixed in­come trad­ing and cash man­age­ment, as well as credit cards and dig­i­tal con­sumer bank­ing.</p>
    <p>He also wound down a huge book of trou­bled as­sets known as Citi Hold­ings, ef­fec­tively trans­form­ing the bank from a bailed out, money-los­ing en­tity with op­er­a­tions span­ning the world into a slim­mer, more prof­itable ver­sion with tar­geted global op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>He will of­fi­cially hand the reins to Ms Fraser in Fe­bru­ary, Cit­i­group said in a state­ment. “We be­lieve Jane is the right per­son to build on Mike’s record and take Citi to the next level,” said Mr John C. Du­gan, chair of the board of di­rec­tors at Citi.</p>
