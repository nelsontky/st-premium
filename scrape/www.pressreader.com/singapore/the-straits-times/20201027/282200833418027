    <p>Pres­sure is mount­ing on South Korea to exit a mul­ti­mil­lion-dol­lar coal project in Viet­nam, with a con­sor­tium of 21 Euro­pean in­vestors be­ing the lat­est to raise ob­jec­tions to the coun­try’s de­ci­sion to invest in coal over­seas while pur­su­ing a low-car­bon ini­tia­tive back home.</p>
    <p>Green ac­tivists are al­ready up in arms over what they have called a “hyp­o­crit­i­cal” move by the sta­te­owned Korea Elec­tric Power Cor­po­ra­tion (Kepco) to go ahead with the Vung Ang 2 coal project in Viet­nam, weeks af­ter Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in de­clared a cli­mate cri­sis and the Na­tional As­sem­bly voted in favour of set­ting a goal to achieve net zero emis­sions by 2050.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean con­sor­tium, which man­ages over US$5.5 tril­lion (S$7.5 tril­lion) in as­sets, sent a let­ter last week to firms in­volved in the project, in­clud­ing Kepco, Sam­sung C&T, Ja­pan’s Mit­subishi Cor­po­ra­tion, the United States’ Gen­eral Elec­tric and En­ergy China GPEC.</p>
    <p>Mr Eric Ped­er­sen of Nordea As­set Man­age­ment, the largest as­set man­ager in the Nordics, said it “shares with a fast-grow­ing group of in­ter­na­tional in­vestors the view that it is not too late to change course”. Nordea man­ages €235 bil­lion (S$378 bil­lion) in as­sets and has about €400 mil­lion in­vested in com­pa­nies in­volved in the Viet­namese project.</p>
    <p>To­gether with 20 other in­vestors, in­clud­ing Dan­ish state fund MP Pen­sion and the Church of Fin­land, Nordea has urged the firms in­volved in Vung Ang 2 to with­draw from the project, ar­gu­ing that it goes against the Paris Agree­ment’s net zero emis­sions tar­get and did not meet in­ter­na­tion­ally ac­cepted stan­dards for eval­u­at­ing po­ten­tial en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact.</p>
    <p>South Korea has long been crit­i­cised for be­ing one of the world’s largest coal fi­nanciers. A re­port re­leased last week by Green­peace Seoul Of­fice, Korea Sus­tain­abil­ity In­vest­ing Fo­rum, and law­maker Yangyi Wony­oung of the rul­ing Demo­cratic Party shows that South Korean in­sti­tu­tions, both pub­lic and pri­vate, have fi­nanced US$50 bil­lion worth of coal projects in the past 12 years.</p>
    <p>Of the US$8.92 bil­lion in­vested over­seas, 92 per cent is backed by pub­lic in­sti­tu­tions. This “coal ad­dic­tion” is prob­lem­atic as it sends a mes­sage for pri­vate fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to fol­low suit, the re­port said. The pri­vate sec­tor ac­counts for 63 per cent of to­tal coal in­vest­ments, while the rest is pub­lic money.</p>
    <p>Ms Yangyi said the re­port “shows how far be­hind the coun­try stands in the global tran­si­tion from coal to re­new­ables”.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts and ac­tivists said it is not too late for South Korea to bow out of the Viet­namese project.</p>
    <p>Mr Youn Se-jong, direc­tor of cli­mate fi­nance at non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion So­lu­tions for Our Cli­mate, said a with­drawal would be in the in­ter­est of the play­ers in­volved as the eco­nomic prospects of the project, ac­cord­ing to a pre-fea­si­bil­ity study, are poor. There is also in­creas­ing rep­u­ta­tional risk, as well as the risk of de­lay and cost over­runs, he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“It is not too late be­cause the con­trac­tual ar­range­ments for the project are not com­plete yet, and it can be fur­ther de­layed.”</p>
    <p>Ms Thu Vu, en­ergy fi­nance an­a­lyst of the Institute for En­ergy Eco­nom­ics and Fi­nan­cial Anal­y­sis, a global think-tank, noted that Viet­namese ne­go­tia­tors are still “care­fully re­assess­ing the ne­ces­sity of the project” in view of fac­tors such as the pos­si­bil­ity that the new coal plant may “no longer be cost-com­pet­i­tive” by the time it is com­pleted, say, in five years.</p>
    <p>South Korean spon­sors might not be able to af­ford the time needed by their Viet­namese state part­ners, “given the quickly nar­row­ing win­dow for fos­sil fuel fi­nanc­ing and mount­ing pres­sure from global in­vestors and green ac­tivists”, she added.</p>
    <p>For Sam­sung C&T, Vung Ang 2 would be its last coal power project. The com­pany told ST that it de­cided to par­tic­i­pate in the project af­ter “care­ful re­view” of var­i­ous fac­tors, in­clud­ing in­ter­gov­ern­men­tal re­la­tions and the firm’s tech­no­log­i­cal ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Vung Ang 2 will be built to “en­vi­ron­men­tal stan­dards much tighter than those set forth by the Viet­namese gov­ern­ment and even the World Bank”, it said.</p>
    <p>South Korea still has 60 coal plants gen­er­at­ing about 40 per cent of the coun­try’s elec­tric­ity. But there are plans to close 30 of them by 2034, in line with na­tional goals to cut green­house emis­sions and shift to re­new­able en­ergy.</p>
