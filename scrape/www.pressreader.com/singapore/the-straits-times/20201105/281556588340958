    <p>There were good rea­sons and suf­fi­cient ev­i­dence to charge Ms Parti Liyani for theft, and po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tors and prosecutor­s had as­sessed that she was un­truth­ful, Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>After she was ar­rested, Ms Parti ad­mit­ted tak­ing 10 to 15 items of male cloth­ing with­out per­mis­sion, and her ex­pla­na­tions for some of the items changed from one state­ment to another, he told Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter was de­liv­er­ing a min­is­te­rial state­ment on the case of Ms Parti, who was ac­quit­ted by the High Court on Sept 4 of steal­ing from then Changi Air­port Group chair­man Liew Mun Leong – who had lodged a po­lice re­port against her in 2016 – and his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>The case sparked an up­roar, with MPs and oth­ers rais­ing ques­tions about the crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam said the case was han­dled as a rou­tine theft case and there was no at­tempt by any­one to in­flu­ence the po­lice or prosecutor­s. “There was suf­fi­cient ev­i­dence which showed theft of­fences were likely to have been com­mit­ted,” he added.</p>
    <p>In his state­ment, the min­is­ter re­counted the facts of the case, which were heard in court.</p>
    <p>He told MPs that when Ms Parti was ar­rested on Dec 2, 2016, some items were found on her, in­clud­ing two Longchamp bags, two watches and two white iPhone 4s.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam also noted how, for ex­am­ple, on Dec 4, 2016, she said in her po­lice state­ment that two watches – one a “Vacheron Con­stantin” and the other a “Swatch” – were gifts from a friend.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in a state­ment on May 29, 2017, she changed her story to say that she had found the two watches – which turned out to be coun­ter­feits – in the trash of Mr Liew’s daugh­ter May.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti’s claim that she had found items such as a Prada bag, two Ap­ple iPhones and a pair of Gucci sun­glasses in the trash were also found to be not cred­i­ble by the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC), said Mr Shan­mugam.</p>
    <p>Putting to­gether Ms Parti’s ap­par­ent in­con­sis­ten­cies, her ques­tion­able claims about find­ing ex­pen­sive items in the trash and her own ad­mis­sion to tak­ing the male cloth­ing, the AGC’s view was that there was a case to pros­e­cute, said the min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>He added that at that point in time, the Liews had iden­ti­fied all the items in the charges as their be­long­ings.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, while Ms Parti claimed she had found some jewellery in the trash, Ms Liew said she never threw jewellery away and would give away un­wanted</p>
    <p>jewellery to the Sal­va­tion Army or friends.</p>
    <p>In this in­stance, the AGC as­sessed that Ms Liew’s ev­i­dence was more be­liev­able.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam said the AGC also took the view that there was a clear public in­ter­est in pros­e­cut­ing Ms Parti for two rea­sons.</p>
    <p>“One, it ap­peared that Ms Parti had stolen many items, in­clud­ing some seem­ingly ex­pen­sive items. Two, it ap­peared that she had been steal­ing for years, and it was not im­pul­sive, spur-of-the-mo­ment de­ci­sions,” he added.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter said he was set­ting out these ma­te­ri­als in some de­tail so that MPs can as­sess for them­selves the ba­sis for the de­ci­sions the po­lice and the AGC had reached.</p>
    <p>He also said there was a prima fa­cie case against Ms Parti, and that the po­lice and prose­cu­tion did not know that the Liews, in par­tic­u­lar, Mr Karl Liew, would be in­con­sis­tent dur­ing the trial.</p>
    <p>After her trial in the State Courts, which was heard for over 20 days, the district judge found se­ri­ous in­con­sis­ten­cies in Ms Parti’s ev­i­dence and that she had var­i­ous ver­sions for cer­tain items.</p>
    <p>The trial judge noted that Ms Parti said dif­fer­ent things in her state­ment, com­pared with her tes­ti­mony in court, which some­times changed un­der cross-ex­am­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>The trial judge also found her tes­ti­mony on some items to be im­plau­si­ble. For ex­am­ple, Ms Parti said she had picked up two phones from a rub­bish bag. The iPhone 4 mod­els were about six years old at the time.</p>
    <p>The trial j udge pre­ferred the Liews’ tes­ti­mony that they would not dis­card old mo­bile phones and used them as spares or to keep pho­to­graphs.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam said the trial judge found Ms Parti to be un­truth­ful, after hear­ing ev­i­dence from 12 prose­cu­tion wit­nesses and four de­fence wit­nesses, and had the op­por­tu­nity to ob­serve them and con­sider their tes­ti­mony.</p>
    <p>The High Court, how­ever, came to a dif­fer­ent view after a three­day ap­peal. Mr Shan­mugam noted that the High Court judge gave Ms Parti the ben­e­fit of doubt be­cause he was trou­bled by Mr Karl Liew’s un­re­li­able state­ments.</p>
    <p>About 10 per cent of ap­peals in crim­i­nal cases suc­ceed in set­ting aside the con­vic­tions or re­duc­ing the sen­tence, Mr Shan­mugam said, adding that this case fell within that cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>The High Court’s de­ci­sion on the ac­quit­tal is fi­nal and there is no ap­peal, he noted, say­ing the state­ment is not an ex­er­cise of re­open­ing it.</p>
