    <p>Ma­rina Bay Sands (MBS) and Sen­tosa is­land have been ear­marked by ob­servers as po­ten­tial venues for Sin­ga­pore to stage the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum (WEF) an­nual meet­ing in May next year.</p>
    <p>The gath­er­ing of global po­lit­i­cal and busi­ness lead­ers typ­i­cally at­tracts around 3,000 to its usual lo­ca­tion in the ritzy Alpine ski re­sort of Davos in Switzer­land.</p>
    <p>Asked for po­ten­tial venues be­ing con­sid­ered, Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try (MTI) said such in­for­ma­tion and fur­ther de­tails would be pro­vided at a later date.</p>
    <p>Dr Michael Chiam, a se­nior tourism lec­turer at Ngee Ann Polytech­nic, said the venue must be large and mod­u­lar enough to pro­vide meet­ing rooms and spa­ces to ac­com­mo­date par­tic­i­pants – with safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>“In the past, many peo­ple could con­gre­gate in a big hall. With the pan­demic, par­tic­i­pants will likely be spread across the venue space in var­i­ous rooms,” he sug­gested.</p>
    <p>With a plethora of key main meet­ings ac­com­pa­nied by an even greater num­ber of smaller in­ter­ac­tions on the side, it would not be pos­si­ble for one sin­gle ho­tel to hold the en­tire event, said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lawrence Loh from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) busi­ness school.</p>
    <p>He pointed to Ma­rina Bay Sands, with its ho­tel and con­ven­tion cen­tre ca­pa­bil­i­ties, as most equipped to han­dle at least the bulk of key gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>An­other pos­si­bil­ity, said Prof Loh, would be a “hub-and-spoke” con­cept with a cen­tral meet­ing lo­ca­tion such as Sin­ga­pore Expo or the Re­sorts World Con­ven­tion Cen­tre on Sen­tosa, sup­ple­mented with ho­tels scat­tered around the is­land.</p>
    <p>“Lodg­ing is more flex­i­ble and can be de­cen­tralised. But we don’t want peo­ple to waste time hop­ping around for meet­ings,” he said,</p>
    <p>Dr Chong Ja Ian from NUS’ po­lit­i­cal sci­ence depart­ment noted that Sen­tosa could also be sealed off eas­ily for se­cu­rity rea­sons.</p>
    <p>Prof Loh said that above all, safety should be the or­gan­is­ers’ fun­da­men­tal con­sid­er­a­tion when set­tling on the venue. “And the most im­por­tant fac­tor is the safety of our own res­i­dents in Sin­ga­pore,” he added.</p>
    <p>Agree­ing, Dr Jeremy Lim from NUS’ Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health said: “What’s im­por­tant is that the del­e­gates, and ev­ery­one who’s in­volved in host­ing the WEF meet­ing, don’t have un­fet­tered cir­cu­la­tion among the gen­eral pub­lic.”</p>
