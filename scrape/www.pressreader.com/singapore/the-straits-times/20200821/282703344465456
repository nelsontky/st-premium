    <p>SEOUL • Dy­na­mite, the first song by South Korean boy band BTS to be sung en­tirely in English, drops to­day.</p>
    <p>As with any­thing to do with the world’s big­gest boy band, ex­cite­ment has reached fever pitch and re­ac­tions have been ex­plo­sive.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, the septet re­leased a teaser clip for the mu­sic video on YouTube and it has al­ready seen more than 40 mil­lion views.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with Amer­i­can news­pa­per USA To­day, the group, through an in­ter­preter, shared the story be­hind Dy­na­mite’s pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>They said step­ping out of their com­fort zones to sing in English took some get­ting used to, es­pe­cially get­ting the pro­nun­ci­a­tions right.</p>
    <p>“It was not hard but in­ter­est­ing. It was an in­ter­est­ing kind of chal­lenge,” mem­ber Jung-kook said.</p>
    <p>Nam-joon, bet­ter known by his RM stage name, noted it was “fun hard”.</p>
    <p>The group, which de­buted in 2013, said cre­at­ing the song was “like des­tiny”. Nam-joon added: “Who would ever think of this pan­demic? No meet­ing, no karaoke, no con­certs? Even no walk­ing in the park. So we never ex­pected this song would come fully in English. Dur­ing the process of mak­ing our al­bum... it just came to us.”</p>
    <p>Yoon-gi, whose stage names are Suga and Agust D, added that the pan­demic is “a sit­u­a­tion that ev­ery­body else around the world is fac­ing, so we just started to ex­plore what can we do right now, what can we do re­ally good?”</p>
    <p>When they an­nounced the re­lease of Dy­na­mite last month, BTS said: “When we first heard and recorded the song, we were en­er­gised.”</p>
    <p>When asked dur­ing the USA To­day in­ter­view if the group plan to re­lease more mu­sic in English, Tae-hyung, also known as V, said: “Don’t not look for­ward to it.”</p>
