    <p>•</p>
    <p>Re­quir­ing just one vic­tory from their two re­main­ing games, Real Madrid are in the driv­ing seat to qual­ify from Group B in the Cham­pi­ons League this week.</p>
    <p>The same, how­ever, can­not be said in La Liga. The Span­ish cham­pi­ons slumped to their third de­feat of the sea­son on Satur­day, go­ing down 2-1 at home to un­fan­cied Alaves.</p>
    <p>Real have now lost three of their last five home games in all com­pe­ti­tions, as many de­feats as in their pre­vi­ous 31 matches at home and to make mat­ters worse, Eden Hazard suf­fered yet an­other in­jury.</p>
    <p>In what coach Zine­dine Zi­dane de­scribed as their “worst start to a game all sea­son”, Madrid were not at the races as Lu­cas Perez opened the scor­ing from the spot just five min­utes in.</p>
    <p>Thibaut Cour­tois then made a ter­ri­ble er­ror early in the sec­ond half by send­ing a stray pass to Alaves for­ward Joselu, who scored eas­ily.</p>
    <p>Casemiro grabbed one back four min­utes from the end but the vis­i­tors hung on for the de­served vic­tory, leav­ing Zi­dane per­plexed over their league tra­vails.</p>
    <p>“I have no ex­pla­na­tion, the de­feat wasn’t down to our at­ti­tude or how well we played, given our per­for­mance (in Europe) last week, but you can­not af­ford to start a match like we did to­day. That was the worst start we have made this sea­son,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We were a lit­tle bit bet­ter in the sec­ond half but what we did was not enough, we did very lit­tle to change the game.”</p>
    <p>Madrid had six ab­sen­tees in­clud­ing Ser­gio Ramos and Karim Ben­zema and Hazard had to be taken off although Zi­dane in­sisted the €100 mil­lion (S$160 mil­lion) for­ward, who since mov­ing to the San­ti­ago Bern­abeu last sum­mer has spent most of the time on the side­lines, was car­ry­ing a knock.</p>
    <p>The French­man is now count­ing on the re­turn of his miss­ing play­ers as they seek to get back to win­ning ways in La Liga.</p>
    <p>“We have a lot of prob­lems with in­juries, we don’t want to look for ex­cuses but that’s the re­al­ity,” Zi­dane said. “Hope­fully, when we get play­ers back, we’ll start to im­prove. Right now, the prob­lem we have is con­sis­tency, that’s clear.”</p>
    <p>Else­where, Atletico Madrid pro­vi­sion­ally moved to the top of La Liga along­side Real So­ciedad af­ter an own goal by Toni Lato saw the vis­i­tors se­cure a 1-0 vic­tory at Va­len­cia.</p>
    <p>Diego Sime­one’s men, who have 23 points from nine matches, also have one game in hand and the Mestalla win of­fers proof of their “huge progress” this term, said the Ar­gen­tinian coach.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, goals by Martin Braith­waite, An­toine Griez­mann, Philippe Coutinho and Lionel Messi gave Barcelona a 4-0 vic­tory over Osasuna at the Nou Camp to move up to sev­enth, nine points be­hind the co-lead­ers.</p>
