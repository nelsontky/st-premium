    <p>U.S. SEC­RE­TARY OF STATE MIKE POM­PEO, ON THE UNITED STATES REIMPOSING SANC­TIONS AGAINST IRAN DE­SPITE OB­JEC­TIONS FROM OTHER WORLD POW­ERS</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASHINGTON Over the stren­u­ous ob­jec­tions of its clos­est al­lies, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion reim­posed United Na­tions sanc­tions against Iran on Satur­day, though the weight of their reper­cus­sions is un­clear with­out the co­op­er­a­tion of the world’s other ma­jor pow­ers.</p>
    <p>In an evening state­ment, United States Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo an­nounced the “re­turn of vir­tu­ally all pre­vi­ously ter­mi­nated UN sanc­tions” and, in ef­fect, de­clared a 2015 nu­clear ac­cord with Iran as no longer in force.</p>
    <p>“The world will be safer as a re­sult,” Mr Pom­peo said.</p>
    <p>He also warned that the US “is pre­pared to use our do­mes­tic au­thor­i­ties to im­pose con­se­quences” on other coun­tries that do not en­force the sanc­tions. He did not elab­o­rate.</p>
    <p>Min­utes af­ter Mr Pom­peo’s state­ment, the Ira­nian Am­bas­sador to the UN, Mr Ma­jid Takht Ra­vanchi, said the sanc­tions were “null and void”.</p>
    <p>“The US’ il­le­gal and false ‘dead­line’ has come and gone,” Mr Ra­vanchi wrote on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>He warned that Amer­ica’s “swim­ming against in­ter­na­tional cur­rents will only bring it more iso­la­tion”.</p>
    <p>Just a day ear­lier, Bri­tain, France and Ger­many said in a let­ter that the sanc­tions – which the UN had sus­pended af­ter the sign­ing of a</p>
    <p>2015 nu­clear ac­cord – would have no le­gal ef­fect.</p>
    <p>To un­der­score their fun­da­men­tal op­po­si­tion, the let­ter said all three coun­tries would work to pre­serve the 2015 agree­ment, which they jointly ne­go­ti­ated with the US, China and Rus­sia, even as Washington sought to de­stroy its last rem­nants.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion with­drew from the agree­ment more than two years ago.</p>
    <p>“We have worked tire­lessly to pre­serve the nu­clear agree­ment and re­main com­mit­ted to do so,” said the let­ter, a copy of which was viewed by The New York Times.</p>
    <p>Some an­a­lysts said that by reimposing snap­back sanc­tions, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has splin­tered al­liances and frac­tured un­der­stand­ings with the US’ su­per­power ad­ver­saries, Rus­sia and China, which had been uni­fied in reach­ing the 2015 agree­ment.</p>
    <p>Now the US has gone its own way, and Rus­sia and China seem poised to re­sume con­ven­tional weapons sales to Iran next month when an arms em­bargo against Iran ex­pires, over the ob­jec­tions of Washington.</p>
    <p>“The irony I see here is that Trump is ac­tu­ally do­ing the UN and mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism a big favour, be­cause by in­vok­ing the snap­back, he is putting on dis­play that the kind of clumsy uni­lat­er­al­ism that he is known for doesn’t work,” said pro­fes­sor of in­ter­na­tional law Ian John</p>
    <p>stone of the Fletcher School at Tufts Uni­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>He pre­dicted that the sanc­tions would not be en­forced by other coun­tries and would be “met with a col­lec­tive shrug”.</p>
    <p>“The US will in­sist that the sanc­tions are back on, and most other coun­tries will say, ‘No, they’re not,’” said Pro­fes­sor John­stone, who ad­vised for­mer UN sec­re­tary­gen­eral Kofi An­nan.</p>
    <p>In fact, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s in­sis­tence on reimposing the orig­i­nal UN sanc­tions, which had been for­mu­lated dur­ing the Bush and Obama ad­min­is­tra­tions to force Iran to the ne­go­ti­at­ing ta­ble, means that the US alone will en­force them.</p>
    <p>That has raised doubts over whether the sanc­tions will bring much, if any, ad­di­tional eco­nomic pain; one UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil diplo­mat com­pared the US sabr­erat­tling to pulling the trig­ger of an un­loaded gun.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Union has its own arms em­bargo against Iran that is not set to ex­pire un­til 2023, once the In­ter­na­tional Atomic En­ergy Agency rules that the gov­ern­ment in Iran has fol­lowed the terms of the nu­clear deal.</p>
    <p>Un­til such em­bargo is lifted, for­eign diplo­mats pre­dicted that com­pa­nies and busi­ness em­ploy­ees in Europe would con­tinue to ad­here to it – mak­ing the UN sanc­tions largely ir­rel­e­vant for Western al­lies.</p>
    <p>Some an­a­lysts said that by reimposing snap­back sanc­tions, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has splin­tered al­liances and frac­tured un­der­stand­ings with the US’ su­per­power ad­ver­saries, Rus­sia and China, which had been uni­fied in reach­ing the 2015 agree­ment.</p>

        <p data-role="text">A bazaar in the Ira&#xAD;nian cap&#xAD;i&#xAD;tal Te&#xAD;heran this month. There are doubts over whether the United States&#x2019; reim&#xAD;po&#xAD;si&#xAD;tion of the orig&#xAD;i&#xAD;nal United Na&#xAD;tions sanc&#xAD;tions will bring much, if any, ad&#xAD;di&#xAD;tional eco&#xAD;nomic pain to the Ira&#xAD;ni&#xAD;ans, since the Trump ad&#xAD;min&#xAD;is&#xAD;tra&#xAD;tion&#x2019;s in&#xAD;sis&#xAD;tence on the move over the stren&#xAD;u&#xAD;ous ob&#xAD;jec&#xAD;tions of its al&#xAD;lies means that the US alone will en&#xAD;force them.</p>
