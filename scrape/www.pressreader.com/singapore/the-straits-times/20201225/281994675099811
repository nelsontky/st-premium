    <p>Of­fer­ing clar­ity amid un­cer­tainty is tricky, es­pe­cially since lead­ers are ex­pected to have all the an­swers.</p>
    <p>Au­then­tic­ity in com­mu­ni­ca­tion, and be­ing equally open about what is clear and what is not clear is crit­i­cal to es­tab­lish trust. One way is by pro­vid­ing clar­ity of in­for­ma­tion sim­ply, quickly and fre­quently, and by demon­strat­ing that crit­i­cal is­sues are be­ing per­son­ally mon­i­tored by lead­ers.</p>
    <p>PwC Sin­ga­pore con­vened a</p>
    <p>Work from Home Task Force com­pris­ing the firm’s part­ners at the on­set of the pan­demic, which made sure em­ployee men­tal well-be­ing is on its agenda, shared Mr Sam Kok Weng, a se­nior part­ner of the firm.</p>
    <p>When lead­ers have a clear sense of pur­pose that ties back to the mis­sion and val­ues of the or­gan­i­sa­tion, they are more able to in­spire work­ers to feel con­fi­dent and pos­i­tive of their fu­ture. This fos­ters trust and builds good­will.</p>
    <p>Clar­ity in words and ac­tions can help em­ploy­ees feel safe, help them ad­just and cope emo­tion­ally dur­ing a cri­sis like Covid-19. Such clar­ity also helps em­ploy­ees put their ex­pe­ri­ence into con­text – and draw mean­ing from it.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve that we must treat ev­ery­one fairly to cre­ate psy­cho­log­i­cal safety for em­ploy­ees to be them­selves and to feel a sense of be­long­ing to the com­pany, re­gard­less of who they are,” shared Mr Koh Khai Yang, Asia-Pa­cific chair­man of global en­ergy re­search and con­sul­tancy group Wood Macken­zie.</p>
    <p>This year, in ad­di­tion to adding men­tal health to the com­pany’s ben­e­fits pro­gramme for all, Mr</p>
    <p>Koh also made the ground­break­ing de­ci­sion to recog­nise the sta­tus of his em­ploy­ees’ same-sex part­ners by ex­tend­ing the same spouse ben­e­fits to them as het­ero­sex­ual cou­ples.</p>
    <p>Lead­ers who live up to their val­ues and take ac­tion to be con­sis­tent with what they be­lieve in are never si­lent about hard choices, as lead­er­ship ex­pert</p>
    <p>Brene Brown has noted. Men­tal health is a hard and com­plex chal­lenge, made more so by Covid-19 and a fu­ture that is in­creas­ingly more volatile and un­cer­tain as the na­ture of work changes.</p>
    <p>Yet, this “cri­sis of a gen­er­a­tion”, as many have termed the pan­demic, has also pre­sented an un­prece­dented op­por­tu­nity for lead­ers in pub­lic and pri­vate sec­tors to move em­ployee men­tal health and well-be­ing up the pri­or­ity chain.</p>
    <p>In­stead of see­ing the work­place as a source of stress, anx­i­ety and men­tal ills that must be con­stantly mit­i­gated, can lead­ers com­mit to mak­ing work­places a source of men­tal well-be­ing as our fun­da­men­tal re­spon­si­bil­ity?</p>
    <p>When lead­ers show up with courage, com­pas­sion, con­gru­ence and clar­ity for well-be­ing as a strate­gic pri­or­ity, I be­lieve we can.</p>
