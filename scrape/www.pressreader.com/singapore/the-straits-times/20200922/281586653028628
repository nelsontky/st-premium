    <p>While the Covid-19 pan­demic threat­ens to ex­act a heavy toll on its labour market, Sin­ga­pore has still man­aged to drum up and of­fer some 5,400 jobs in the food ser­vice and food man­u­fac­tur­ing in­dus­tries. These po­si­tions have been avail­able since April un­der the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Pack­age.</p>
    <p>While the Covid-19 pan­demic threat­ens to ex­act a heavy toll on Sin­ga­pore’s labour market, the coun­try has still man­aged to drum up and of­fer some 5,400 jobs in the food ser­vice and food man­u­fac­tur­ing in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>These po­si­tions have been avail­able since April un­der the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Pack­age, and about two in five of them, or 2,070, are for pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs), it was re­vealed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>With the econ­omy slow­ing and re­trench­ments start­ing to bite, Sin­ga­pore has been squeez­ing out jobs, at­tach­ments and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties across var­i­ous sec­tors to en­gage and reskill its work­force amid the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Said Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo yes­ter­day: “Work­ers who have been reskilled not only get to keep their jobs, but also ac­quire new skills and take on high­er­value tasks. There is also scope for them to earn higher wages when the econ­omy im­proves.”</p>
    <p>She was giv­ing the sixth edi­tion of her min­istry’s job sit­u­a­tion re­port yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Past edi­tions of the job re­port, which started on Aug 11, have thrown up a to­tal of 16,100 jobs and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties in sec­tors such as pre­ci­sion en­gi­neer­ing, in­fo­com­mu­ni­ca­tion tech­nol­ogy, man­u­fac­tur­ing and start-ups.</p>
    <p>Some 2,430 in­di­vid­u­als have al­ready man­aged to take up these jobs and other op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>The im­pact on the food sec­tor dur­ing the pan­demic was un­even, Mrs</p>
    <p>Teo said. Food ser­vices were badly hit, es­pe­cially dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker. On the other hand, food man­u­fac­tur­ing com­pa­nies that sold sta­ple foods man­aged to do well.</p>
    <p>Now jobs are avail­able again, with about 2,070 PMET po­si­tions for roles such as food tech­nol­o­gists, chefs, food and bev­er­age ser­vice man­agers and busi­ness devel­op­ment man­agers.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing 3,350 j obs in­cluded su­per­vi­sors and gen­eral fore­men for food pro­cess­ing, bak­ers, pas­try and con­fec­tionery mak­ers as well as shop and store sales­men.</p>
    <p>Salaries can vary and while a man­u­fac­tur­ing man­ager at the 75th per­centile can earn $6,050, the me­dian salary is around $2,850.</p>
    <p>For bar­tenders and baris­tas, those at the 75th per­centile earn $2,600 while the me­dian salary is $2,150.</p>
    <p>Apart from the jobs avail­able in the two food-re­lated in­dus­tries, Mrs Teo re­vealed that there are around 540 com­pany-hosted trainee­ships and at­tach­ments on of­fer as well as 740 train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties avail­able.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mrs Teo also said that more than 1,800 peo­ple found jobs or un­der­went train­ing in the food sec­tor through Work­force Sin­ga­pore’s (WSG) pro­grammes be­tween April and July. Nearly 80 of them were mid-ca­reer in­di­vid­u­als who en­tered the sec­tor through ca­reer con­ver­sion pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said peo­ple could con­sider tak­ing up jobs in the food sec­tor, even if they had no pre­vi­ous ex­pe­ri­ence in it, as long as they came with the right at­ti­tude.</p>
    <p>“For those who are com­ing from sec­tors where they have trans­fer­able skills, such as in in­no­va­tion man­age­ment or man­u­fac­tur­ing prac­tice, they will cer­tainly have a more seam­less ex­pe­ri­ence to tune into the food sec­tor, but there will still be spe­cific skills that they will need to pick up,” she said.</p>
    <p>Within the food ser­vice in­dus­try it­self, she said that 900 work­ers were be­ing trained to take up new or higher-value roles un­der WSG’s Job Re­design Reskilling Pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is racing against the clock to cre­ate new jobs while oth­ers are be­ing lost. Labour market statis­tics pub­lished last week re­vealed that 11,350 peo­ple were re­trenched in the first half of this year – the worst show­ing since the 2009 global fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Last Oc­to­ber, Mr David Yeo, 49, quit his job as a sales ex­ec­u­tive at an in­te­rior de­sign com­pany.</p>
    <p>He wanted a job with more sta­ble pay. Af­ter a few months of be­ing a pri­vate tu­tor, he learnt about Work­force Sin­ga­pore’s (WSG) At­tac­hand-Train Pro­gramme for Food Pro­duc­tion Spe­cial­ist, and ap­plied for the nine-month pro­gramme which started in April.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t know any­thing about food man­u­fac­tur­ing. I didn’t even know much about bac­te­ria in daily cook­ing,” said Mr Yeo. “But I was given the chance to join this pro­gramme, so I just jumped right in.”</p>
    <p>Apart from class­room train­ing, Mr Yeo is also re­ceiv­ing train­ing on the job as a food en­gi­neer trainee at Gelato Spe­cial­ists, a lo­cal small to medium-sized en­ter­prise spe­cial­is­ing in man­u­fac­tur­ing gelato, pas­try and choco­late.</p>
    <p>Un­der the pro­gramme, Mr Yeo re­ceives a monthly train­ing al­lowance of $3,500, a sta­ble in­come which helps sup­port his wife and two chil­dren who are in se­condary school. Pre­vi­ously, his pay was er­ratic as it was based on com­mis­sions from com­pleted projects and sales.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo said that join­ing the pro­gramme has opened up new pos­si­bil­i­ties for his ca­reer.</p>
    <p>“At first I feared that maybe I would be slow to pick up new knowl­edge and skills be­cause ev­ery­thing was new and I didn’t know what were the ex­pec­ta­tions,” he said.</p>
    <p>“But you just have to be hum­ble and things will pick up.”</p>
