    <p>Ms Kim Yeon-jeong, head of global K-pop part­ner­ships at Twit­ter, says the ex­pan­sion of South Korea’s pop music and idol in­dus­try can be traced through the so­cial me­dia plat­form, which is hugely pop­u­lar with the K-pop fan com­mu­nity. And she has a good guess as to who the next big thing in K-pop might be.</p>
    <p>For the first time, Twit­ter has part­nered data plat­form K-pop Radar to re­lease num­bers on K-pop con­tent over 10 years. The fig­ures paint a pic­ture of how the global music move­ment has evolved over time and can be ac­cessed in full at bit.ly/2EsiVlu.</p>
    <p>Here are some in­ter­est­ing nuggets gleaned from the re­port.</p>
    <p>THE YEAR K-POP GOT EVEN BIG­GER</p>
    <p>The num­ber of K-pop-re­lated tweets climbed steeply in 2017.</p>
    <p>That was the year pop­u­lar boy band EXO, which made their de­but in 2012, fi­nally started their Twit­ter ac­count.</p>
    <p>That was also the year BTS won Top So­cial Artist, voted for by fans, at the Bill­board Music Awards. They broke Cana­dian singer Justin Bieber’s six-year hold on the award – mark­ing their en­trance into the cir­cuit of Amer­i­can music awards.</p>
    <p>SIN­GA­PORE IS SMALL BUT LOUD</p>
    <p>Go­ing by the num­ber of unique users who post about K-pop, Sin­ga­pore does not even rank in the top 20 coun­tries on Twit­ter which talk about K-pop.</p>
    <p>But go­ing by tweet vol­ume, Sin­ga­pore is the 13th-big­gest mar­ket for K-pop this year – prov­ing that fans here are pas­sion­ate about it.</p>
    <p>ARTISTS ON TOP</p>
    <p>The most-fol­lowed K-pop group ac­count on Twit­ter be­longs to BTS, who have over 29 mil­lion fol­low­ers. EXO are next, with</p>
    <p>9.1 mil­lion fol­low­ers.</p>
    <p>For in­di­vid­ual ac­counts, BigBang leader G-Dragon, of­ten known as the King of K-pop, is tops with</p>
    <p>8.7 mil­lion fol­low­ers.</p>
    <p>MOST-MEN­TIONED SONGS</p>
    <p>EXO’s Ob­ses­sion took the top spot for the most men­tioned K-pop song in the past year, but BTS had five en­tries on the list, with On, Boy With Luv, Black Swan, In­ter­lude: Shadow and DNA.</p>
    <p>The list was rounded out by Su­perM’s Jop­ping,</p>
    <p>GOT7’s Not By The Moon, Black­pink’s How You Like That and Twice’s Feel</p>
    <p>Spe­cial.</p>
    <p>WHO’S POP­U­LAR IN SIN­GA­PORE</p>
    <p>The most men­tioned K-pop artists in Sin­ga­pore in the last year are, in de­scend­ing or­der, BTS, EXO, Twice, GOT7, Seven­teen, Ma­mamoo, IZ*One, TXT, Black­pink and Stray Kids.</p>
