    <p>TOKYO • Ja­pan yes­ter­day re­ported a record of more than 3,000 new coro­n­avirus cases in one day, pub­lic broad­caster NHK re­ported, as the num­ber of cases con­tin­ues to rise in the win­ter.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 3,041 peo­ple were in­fected, NHK said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The cap­i­tal Tokyo yes­ter­day con­firmed 621 new cases, sur­pass­ing the pre­vi­ous record of 602 marked last Thurs­day, Ky­odo news agency re­ported.</p>
    <p>In most ar­eas of Tokyo, restau­rants, bars and karaoke es­tab­lish­ments that serve al­co­hol have been asked to shorten their busi­ness hours and close at 10 pm.</p>
    <p>Tokyo started to see the num­ber of cases rise sharply in the mid­dle of last month and is the hard­esthit among the coun­try’s 47 pre­fec­tures, with more than 46,000 cases con­firmed to date.</p>
    <p>A panel of med­i­cal ex­perts on Fri­day urged the cen­tral gov­ern­ment to stop the Go To Travel cam­paign – that pro­vides mas­sive sub­si­dies for do­mes­tic tourists – in ar­eas where med­i­cal sys­tems have come un­der strain.</p>
    <p>But Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga, who has been in­sist­ing that the travel cam­paign should not be made a scape­goat for the third wave of Covid-19 cases, has been re­luc­tant to roll back the pro­gramme as he seeks to bal­ance sup­port­ing the econ­omy and fight­ing the virus.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion leader Yukio Edano of the Con­sti­tu­tional Demo­cratic Party of Ja­pan told re­porters in Tokyo the Go To Travel sub­sidy pro­gramme “needs to be sus­pended as soon as pos­si­ble” to help ar­rest the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>So far, at least 2,588 peo­ple have died in Ja­pan from the virus.</p>
    <p>South Korea also re­ported a record 950 daily coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, ex­ceed­ing the late-Fe­bru­ary peak of 909, with the Pres­i­dent calling the coun­try’s third wave of Covid-19 an “emer­gency”.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials an­nounced 950 new in­fec­tions af­ter sev­eral days re­port­ing num­bers rang­ing from about 500 to 600. Some 669 were re­ported in the greater Seoul area yes­ter­day, ac­cord­ing to the Korea Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion Agency, prompt­ing wor­ries about a ma­jor out­break in the densely pop­u­lated area – home to half the coun­try’s 52 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>South Korea has a to­tal to 41,736 in­fec­tions with 578 deaths.</p>
    <p>The South Korean au­thor­i­ties warned they may tighten so­cial dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions to their strictest level, but held off for now.</p>
    <p>“This is in­deed an emer­gency sit­u­a­tion,” said Pres­i­dent Moon Jaein, or­der­ing the mo­bil­i­sa­tion of po­lice, mil­i­tary per­son­nel and pub­lic med­i­cal doc­tors in an ef­fort to curb the fur­ther spread of the coro­n­avirus, chiefly driven by small, wide­spread clus­ters.</p>
    <p>“We plan to ex­ten­sively ex­pand drive-through and walk-through coro­n­avirus test­ing meth­ods... as pre­emp­tive mea­sures to track down in­fected peo­ple and block the spread,” Mr Moon said in a Face­book post.</p>
    <p>South Korea is likely to see a fur­ther rise in the caseload with sig­nif­i­cant in­creases in test­ing, he added.</p>
    <p>An ad­di­tional 150 test­ing cen­tres will be set up in ar­eas with heavy move­ment of peo­ple in­clud­ing train sta­tions. Of­fi­cials said in­fec­tions linked to a church and a hos­pi­tal in the Seoul met­ro­pol­i­tan area, as well as pri­vate gath­er­ings, drove up the tally of cases.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Chung Sye-kyun told an emer­gency meet­ing: “If we don’t curb the spread now, es­ca­lat­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions to Level 3 would be in­evitable.”</p>
