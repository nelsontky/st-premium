    <p>The coun­try’s fa­tal­ity rate is one of the low­est, daily com­mu­nity in­fec­tions are down to a hand­ful, and fewer than 100 pa­tients re­main in hospi­tal. Sin­ga­pore avoided al­low­ing Covid-19 to burn through the pop­u­la­tion to de­velop herd im­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>By build­ing up con­tact trac­ing and test­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties, Sin­ga­pore quickly iso­lated pa­tients and close con­tacts and tested many peo­ple daily.</p>
    <p>More pa­tients could be treated as Sin­ga­pore dou­bled its in­ten­sive care unit ca­pac­ity and set up tem­po­rary com­mu­nity care and iso­la­tion fa­cil­i­ties. It mo­bilised the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces and the Home Team to han­dle out­breaks in mi­grant worker dor­mi­to­ries while tak­ing care of work­ers’ health and wel­fare. Sin­ga­pore slowed down the spread of Covid-19 in the com­mu­nity by putting in place the circuit breaker.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties could have quar­an­tined all re­turn­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans, and not just those re­turn­ing from cer­tain places, due to the risk of asymp­to­matic spread. They could also have tested all of them, in­stead of just those with symp­toms.</p>
    <p>Face masks could have been rec­om­mended to ev­ery­one sooner. The Gov­ern­ment took the best avail­able sci­en­tific ad­vice at the time and changed its pol­icy once the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion recog­nised asymp­to­matic trans­mis­sion was a ma­jor prob­lem. Sin­ga­pore could have acted more quickly and ag­gres­sively to con­trol the rapid spread of the dis­ease in mi­grant worker dorms.</p>
