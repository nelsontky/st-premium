    <p>With Malaysia’s Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion wors­en­ing, peo­ple are ques­tion­ing gov­ern­ment flip-flop­ping over re­stric­tions in the Klang Val­ley, even as Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s gov­ern­ment is at risk of col­lapse. Just days af­ter an­nounc­ing tighter con­trols, the gov­ern­ment, among other things, al­lowed mosques, gyms and parks to re­open.</p>
    <p>With Malaysia’s Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion wors­en­ing and a record daily in­crease of 871 cases on Sun­day, peo­ple are ques­tion­ing gov­ern­ment flip-flops over re­stric­tions in the Klang Val­ley even as Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s gov­ern­ment is at risk of col­lapse.</p>
    <p>Just days af­ter an­nounc­ing that tighter con­trols would be­gin on Oct 14, the gov­ern­ment, among other things, al­lowed mosques, gyms and parks to re­open.</p>
    <p>“There are quar­ters who called for stricter con­trol, but there are also those who think other­wise,” said Se­nior Min­is­ter for Se­cu­rity Is­mail Sabri Yaakob. “Nev­er­the­less, we must cre­ate a bal­ance be­tween re­viv­ing the econ­omy and pro­tect­ing the peo­ple from the virus.”</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, he an­nounced yet an­other new rule: Klang Val­ley res­i­dents must work from home start­ing to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Malaysia is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing its worst wave of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Sabah’s Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion is in­creas­ingly dire, prompt­ing the fed­eral gov­ern­ment to fly front-line work­ers into the state and send in the mil­i­tary to set up field hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>Sarawak may be the next Covid-19 bat­tle­ground as some politi­cians are push­ing for state polls soon even though they are not due un­til mid-next year.</p>
    <p>Kuala Lumpur res­i­dent Su­san Lim, 50, said: “The U-turns make it seem like the gov­ern­ment is bow­ing to pop­ulist de­mand. Our pos­i­tive cases are higher and more wide­spread than dur­ing the ear­lier lock­down in March, but the mea­sures are more re­laxed.”</p>
    <p>The con­di­tional move­ment con­trol or­der in Kuala Lumpur, Se­lan­gor and Pu­tra­jaya is ex­pected to end next Tues­day, but health ex­perts have said it may be ex­tended if the out­break does not im­prove.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Muhyid­din was pre­vi­ously seen as hav­ing man­aged the out­break well but this is fast chang­ing, with politi­cians seem­ingly dis­tracted by on­go­ing power grabs and the con­stant U-turns.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst Awang Az­man Awang Pawi of Univer­siti Malaya said: “Muhyid­din’s po­si­tion is in­creas­ingly shaky... as many Malaysians are un­happy over how the cur­rent out­break is han­dled.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment needs to be firmer in han­dling the out­break. Flip-flops will just cre­ate con­fu­sion among the peo­ple, and the gov­ern­ment will be seen as lack­ing a clear pol­icy in the fight against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“This will lead to a fur­ther lack of con­fi­dence in the Perikatan Na­sional ad­min­is­tra­tion and Muhyid­din’s premier­ship.”</p>
    <p>There are also con­cerns that a snap gen­eral elec­tion, if called, would cause cases to spike fur­ther.</p>
    <p>For now, the au­thor­i­ties have ruled out a re­turn of the stricter move­ment con­trol or­der (MCO) in Klang Val­ley. The MCO saw all nonessen­tial busi­nesses and schools shut be­tween March 18 and May 4.</p>
    <p>“An MCO prob­a­bly will work in a shorter pe­riod of time but will cost the coun­try eco­nom­i­cally,” Health Min­istry direc­tor-gen­eral Noor Hisham Ab­dul­lah said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He noted that the na­tional re­pro­duc­tion num­ber (Rt) fell in the last week to 1.5 from 2.2. The aim is to achieve an Rt of 0.3. Rt refers to the in­fec­tion rate and is an es­ti­ma­tion of the av­er­age num­ber of peo­ple one pa­tient can in­fect.</p>
    <p>Se­lan­gor’s Rt dropped from 1.98 to 1.48 in the last week.</p>
    <p>But some, like Madam Lim, be­lieve tighter curbs are needed.</p>
    <p>“We can’t af­ford more dis­rup­tions to the econ­omy but surely a short but strict lock­down is bet­ter than a pro­longed one that al­lows so much move­ment,” she said.</p>
