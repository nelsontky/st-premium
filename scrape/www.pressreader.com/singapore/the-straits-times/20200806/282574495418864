    <p>This week, two films put dam­aged per­sons at the cen­tre of the story. In the first, a sur­vivor of child­hood abuse has to make a reck­on­ing with her past and, in the other, a man hurt by di­vorce un­leashes his anger on an un­lucky woman.</p>
    <p>South Korean le­gal thriller In­no­cence (PG13, 90 min­utes, opens to­day, ) mis­takes noisy act­ing for big emo­tions, but makes up for it with strong mo­ments of court­room and in­ves­tiga­tive drama.</p>
    <p>Bril­liant young lawyer Jung-in (Shin Hye-sun) trav­els from Seoul to her back­wa­ter birth­place af­ter the fam­ily she left be­hind is im­pli­cated in a mur­der. In try­ing to free her mother from a mur­der charge, she is frus­trated at ev­ery turn by lo­cal au­thor­i­ties, who seem strangely re­luc­tant to pur­sue leads that might clear her mother’s name.</p>
    <p>That prodi­gal daugh­ter-ver­sus-lo­cals theme is sup­ple­mented by char­ac­ters pulled from the Korean drama se­rial play­book, such as the tragic, de­men­tia-ad­dled mother (Bae Jong-ok) and autis­tic brother, both of whom ex­ist mainly as han­kie-fod­der in scenes show­ing them ha­rassed by cops and pros­e­cu­tors.</p>
    <p>Jung-in is her­self a sur­vivor of abuse, a trait that in the story has left its mark by giv­ing her a par­tic­u­larly steely glare and an un­con­quer­able will, show­ing that in Korean drama land, what does not kill you drives you to suc­ceed in your ca­reer.</p>
    <p>In Un­hinged (NC16, 93 min­utes, now show­ing, ), sin­gle mother Rachel (Caren Pis­to­rius) has a scary but all-too-com­mon ex­change of words with an­other driver at a stop sign. That driver, Tom (Russell Crowe), as the ti­tle of the movie sug­gests, is the kind who ex­pects his chivalry – what oth­ers would see as sim­ple de­cency – to be re­warded with ef­fu­sive fem­i­nine grat­i­tude.</p>
    <p>Crowe’s char­ac­ter, a hu­man tank fu­elled by hate, is the best thing about the film, which takes the ur­ban night­mare char­ac­ter of the road-rager and squeezes a thin but work­able chase movie out of it.</p>
    <p>Tom is the misog­y­nist who takes his In­ter­net taunts into real life. As mass shoot­ings in North Amer­ica have proven, men like him are all too real – a fact that the screen­play works seam­lessly into the story with­out mak­ing his ver­balised ideas sound like a plac­ard or a Red­dit post about men’s rights.</p>
    <p>Crowe and Pis­to­rius, as the re­lent­less hunter and ter­ri­fied prey, play off each other well.</p>
    <p>The film fails, as so many of these ur­ban thriller projects do, when it ditches psy­cho­log­i­cal ter­ror for phys­i­cal com­bat, wast­ing the hard-earned sus­pense of the first two acts on a fi­nale that be­fits a C-grade slasher movie.</p>
    <p>Other films open­ing this week but not re­viewed in­clude the ro­mance The Se­cret: Dare To Dream (PG, 107 min­utes, opens to­day), based on the 2006 best-sell­ing self-help book The Se­cret by Rhonda Byrne. The book’s max­ims are per­son­i­fied in Miranda (Katie Holmes), a sin­gle mother who meets the mys­te­ri­ous Bray (Josh Lu­cas), a man who will change her life.</p>
    <p>In Ja­panese hor­ror-thriller Sig­nal 100 (R21, 88 min­utes, opens to­day), a high-school class­room be­comes a scene of car­nage af­ter stu­dents watch a film em­bed­ded with hyp­notic sug­ges­tions, caus­ing them to kill them­selves one by one. The sur­vivors race against time to de­code the mes­sages or be the next to die.</p>
