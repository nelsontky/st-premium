    <p>When Madam Ng Chong Poy, 74, found out late last year that she had de­men­tia, she be­came moody and said she did not want to live any more.</p>
    <p>Her el­dest son, Mr Ray­mond Shong, 51, was at his wits’ end try­ing to pacify her while learn­ing about the syn­drome, which is marked by pro­gres­sive de­te­ri­o­ra­tion in memory, think­ing, be­hav­iour and the abil­ity to per­form ev­ery­day ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>But help was at hand – her doc­tor re­ferred the fam­ily to a new pro­gramme that of­fers hand-hold­ing sup­port to those newly di­ag­nosed with de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>Call­ing it a god­send, Mr Shong, a tu­ition teacher and a fa­ther of three, said the pro­gramme has helped im­prove his mother’s mood, and less­ened his stress con­sid­er­ably.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme, an­nounced at an on­line press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, is Sin­ga­pore’s first post-di­ag­nos­tic de­men­tia sup­port plan. Launched with $2.6 mil­lion from the Lien Foun­da­tion to de­fray the costs for those it helps, Post Di­ag­nos­tic Sup­port (PDS) was de­vel­oped by the foun­da­tion and the Alzheimer’s Dis­ease As­so­ci­a­tion (ADA).</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing a pi­lot at Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal (TTSH) and Khoo Teck Puat Hos­pi­tal (KTPH) last year, PDS will also be avail­able to suit­able pa­tients at the Na­tional Neu­ro­science In­sti­tute in about a month.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 186 peo­ple are now on PDS – 126 from TTSH and 60 from KTPH.</p>
    <p>With PDS, help can be a call away. A ded­i­cated case worker will make one or two ini­tial home vis­its and reg­u­lar phone calls for at least a year. Care­givers on PDS are given a mo­bile num­ber that they can call for ad­vice and sup­port, should they re­quire it.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple can ex­pe­ri­ence iden­tity loss, a lot of un­cer­tainty and a sense of help­less­ness when first told they have de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>IM­PROV­ING QUAL­ITY OF LIFE</p>
    <p>Dr Noor­ha­zlina Ali, a se­nior con­sul­tant at TTSH’s cen­tre for geri­atric medicine, said yes­ter­day that PDS can help those newly di­ag­nosed with de­men­tia and their care­givers come to terms with the di­ag­no­sis, and ad­dress care­giver bur­den and burnout.</p>
    <p>The head of ADA’s Care­giver Sup­port Cen­tre Stephen Chan said PDS em­pow­ers the per­son with de­men­tia and his care­giver to have a better qual­ity of life in­stead of “wait­ing for some­thing bad to hap­pen”.</p>
    <p>He said that some­times, care­givers panic and rush their charges to the emer­gency de­part­ment as they can­not cope with ag­gres­sion in the per­son with de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, when a per­son with de­men­tia has memory loss and this (wors­ens)... they get anx­ious when do­ing sim­ple tasks like bathing or even cook­ing, which can be­come very com­plex,” he said.</p>
    <p>Usu­ally, the first thing peo­ple do is to stop the per­son with de­men­tia from do­ing “risky ac­tiv­i­ties” when the fo­cus should be on how to sup­port him so that he can con­tinue to cook or do an ac­tiv­ity he likes.</p>
    <p>Se­nior so­cial worker Eileen Lee said PDS helped the fam­ily of an el­derly woman with de­men­tia find ways to man­age af­ter the woman for­got she had a new helper and thought the helper was a stranger who might steal her things.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee, one of five case work­ers with the PDS team, said each client will have a cus­tomised care plan when he leaves the pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>It may spell out the kind of care the per­son may wish to have in fu­ture. For in­stance, some­one with a sweet tooth might like an ice cream when he is moody. An­other per­son may give his chil­dren per­mis­sion to place him in a nurs­ing home when they can­not cope any more.</p>
    <p>For about three more years, while PDS is be­ing funded, it will be of­fered free to about 1,400 peo­ple with de­men­tia. The PDS team may be boosted later on with two to three more case work­ers.</p>
    <p>To be on PDS, pa­tients must be re­ferred by a doc­tor. Mr Chan said PDS is mod­elled af­ter a sim­i­lar pro­gramme in Scot­land that en­ti­tles ev­ery­one di­ag­nosed with de­men­tia to at least a year of post-di­ag­nos­tic sup­port.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of peo­ple liv­ing with de­men­tia is pro­jected to rise to 140,000 by 2030, from an es­ti­mated 86,050 last year.</p>
    <p>“We want to be able to re­duce the care­giver bur­den and stress... and the cri­sis sit­u­a­tions that could es­ca­late ad­mis­sion to hos­pi­tal and nurs­ing homes,” Lien Foun­da­tion’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Lee Poh Wah told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“If we do it well, we’ll pre­vent un­nec­es­sary suf­fer­ing, im­prove qual­ity of life and (help to) re­duce healthcare and so­ci­etal costs.”</p>
