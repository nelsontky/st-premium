    <p>Sin­ga­pore val­ues the con­tin­ued con­fi­dence and trust of Bri­tish com­pa­nies in the coun­try as a busi­ness hub, said Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Over 5,000 Bri­tish busi­nesses are op­er­at­ing in Sin­ga­pore, with many us­ing the Repub­lic as a base and launch pad to tap the growth po­ten­tial of South-east Asia, he noted.</p>
    <p>In a re­cent sur­vey by the Bri­tish Cham­ber of Com­merce Sin­ga­pore, over three-quar­ters of re­spon­dents said they have no plans to re­lo­cate their busi­nesses out of the coun­try, demon­strat­ing their con­tin­ued con­fi­dence in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the cham­ber’s an­nual awards cer­e­mony, which was held vir­tu­ally, Mr Chan said Sin­ga­pore will con­tinue to value and wel­come in­ter­na­tional firms and tal­ent in the coun­try. This is even as the Repub­lic will, at times, make ad­just­ments to its man­power poli­cies in ac­cor­dance with the eco­nomic and em­ploy­ment sit­u­a­tion, he added.</p>
    <p>“We recog­nise the role we play as a crit­i­cal node in the global sys­tem, and we’ll con­tinue to build on the com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tages that have brought many of you to Sin­ga­pore,” he said, ac­knowl­edg­ing that con­nec­tiv­ity and open­ness are core val­ues here and es­sen­tial for the coun­try’s con­tin­ued ex­is­tence.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan noted: “I firmly be­lieve that greater in­ter­de­pen­dence and in­te­gra­tion, not frag­men­ta­tion, is what is needed for a strong global re­cov­ery.”</p>
    <p>There is much the United King­dom and Sin­ga­pore can do to­gether to po­si­tion them­selves for re­cov­ery, he said.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, UK-head­quar­tered phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal gi­ant As­traZeneca has en­tered into strate­gic part­ner­ships with lead­ing Sin­ga­pore health­care in­no­va­tors this year, push­ing for bet­ter health out­comes and new eco­nomic op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, al­most half the sub­mis­sions for re­search and devel­op­ment projects be­tween Sin­ga­pore and the Eureka net­work were by Sin­ga­pore-UK part­ner­ships, Mr Chan noted. “All these re­flect the strong mu­tual in­ter­est on the part of Sin­ga­pore and UK com­pa­nies to col­lab­o­rate on projects to­gether.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore also looks for­ward to greater clar­ity in bi­lat­eral eco­nomic and trade ties with the UK with the end of the Brexit tran­si­tion pe­riod this year, Mr Chan said.</p>
    <p>“This will pro­vide much needed cer­tainty to busi­nesses in both Sin­ga­pore and the UK, not just to en­sure trade and in­vest­ment con­ti­nu­ity, but also to seize op­por­tu­ni­ties for growth in the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>In his speech, Mr Chan also said Sin­ga­pore is in­ter­ested to pur­sue fur­ther dig­i­tal econ­omy agree­ments (DEAs) with like-minded economies, in­clud­ing Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>The agree­ments build on Sin­ga­pore’s net­work of free trade agree­ments, and aim to es­tab­lish high­stan­dard rules for is­sues re­lated to dig­i­tal trade, in­clud­ing the safe­guard­ing of per­sonal data.</p>
    <p>“These DEAs help to fos­ter in­no­va­tion, and grow trade and in­vest­ments in new dig­i­tal in­dus­tries such as fin­tech. They also en­able com­pa­nies to use Sin­ga­pore as a base to ac­cess the large and fast­grow­ing South-east Asian dig­i­tal econ­omy, which is ex­pected to grow to US$300 bil­lion (S$409 bil­lion) by 2025,” Mr Chan said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has em­barked on a series of DEAs with coun­tries such as Aus­tralia and New Zealand, and has also launched ne­go­ti­a­tions with South Korea.</p>
    <p>Among the win­ners an­nounced at the Bri­tish cham­ber’s 21st an­nual awards were en­gine maker Rolls-Royce Sin­ga­pore, which clinched the Tech­no­log­i­cal Im­pact Of The Year award, and lo­cal en­vi­ron­ment group Seven Clean Seas, which was named Sus­tain­abil­ity Cham­pion Of The Year.</p>
    <p>EN­SUR­ING STRONG GLOBAL RE­COV­ERY</p>
    <p>I firmly be­lieve that greater in­ter­de­pen­dence and in­te­gra­tion, not frag­men­ta­tion, is what is needed for a strong global re­cov­ery. ’’</p>
    <p>MR CHAN CHUN SING, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter.</p>
