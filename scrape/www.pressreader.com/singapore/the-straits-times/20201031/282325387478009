    <p>On Oct 21, Ital­ian Eu­ge­nio Mon­gelli was about to board an Air France flight in Milan to travel to Sin­ga­pore when the air­line ground crew stopped him.</p>
    <p>Mr Mon­gelli and his Sin­ga­porean part­ner Michelle Poh had suc­cess­fully ap­plied for a short-term visit pass un­der the “spouse-to-be” cat­e­gory for him to travel here. But the crew did not be­lieve him.</p>
    <p>“It was heart-stop­ping. He had al­ready re­ceived his ap­proval let­ter... but the staff didn’t know that Sin­ga­pore was now ac­cept­ing non-busi­ness trav­ellers,” said Ms Poh, 45.</p>
    <p>Mr Mon­gelli, a 55-year-old en­tre­pre­neur, was sup­posed to fly to Amsterdam be­fore catch­ing his oneway con­nect­ing flight to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“He got me on the phone (at 10pm) and I had to con­vince them with my Sin­ga­porean ac­cent and of­fi­cial e-mails,” said Ms Poh.</p>
    <p>Mr Mon­gelli’s short-term visit pass had been ap­proved on Oct 15, af­ter sev­eral ini­tial re­jec­tions when he ap­plied un­der a dif­fer­ent cat­e­gory. For­tu­nately, he was even­tu­ally able to board the plane. His flight from Amsterdam had only 10 pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>On Oct 22, he landed in Sin­ga­pore and passed through the check­point with­out is­sue.</p>
    <p>“The im­mi­gra­tion of­fi­cers were ex­pect­ing me, and af­ter they checked my doc­u­ments, I was quickly taken to my ho­tel by bus to be quar­an­tined,” Mr Mon­gelli said in an in­ter­view from the Man­darin Or­chard ho­tel, where he is serv­ing his stay-home no­tice.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple will fi­nally be re­united when he com­pletes it next Thurs­day, af­ter hav­ing been apart for more than nine months.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple had met in April 2016 when Ms Poh, a vo­cal coach and singer, was per­form­ing at the</p>
    <p>Con­rad Cen­ten­nial ho­tel in Sin­ga­pore. Mr Mon­gelli was in the coun­try for busi­ness.</p>
    <p>He re­turned to Italy about two weeks later but they stayed in touch, oc­ca­sion­ally trav­el­ling to see each other.</p>
    <p>“You know when you’re younger it seems like you have so much time, but for us time is of the essence. He knows he has to come over,” said Ms Poh. “It is very heart­en­ing to see Sin­ga­pore con­sider al­low­ing peo­ple in for rea­sons that are not prac­ti­cal or about busi­ness.”</p>
    <p>The phys­i­cal sep­a­ra­tion has been dif­fi­cult for them as the cou­ple are ac­cus­tomed to see­ing each other for at least two weeks ev­ery month.</p>
    <p>She has busi­ness in Europe and he of­ten trav­els to Asia for work.</p>
    <p>Ms Poh, who is di­vorced, said she could not fly to Italy amid the pan­demic be­cause she has to take care of her 14-year-old son.</p>
    <p>Mr Mon­gelli is also par­ent to a boy, aged 12. The boy lives with his mother.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Poh: “It’s been so hard for all of us, and even harder for peo­ple in non-tra­di­tional re­la­tion­ships to get in­sti­tu­tions to un­der­stand their predica­ment.”</p>
    <p>Mr Mon­gelli, who nar­rowly avoided an­other lock­down in Milan, where the virus is surg­ing again, is plan­ning to stay with Ms Poh as long as his pass al­lows.</p>
    <p>His short-term visit pass is for a month, but he can ap­ply to have it ex­tended by an­other two months.</p>
    <p>He said: “We will al­ways live our lives in both Sin­ga­pore and Europe.</p>
    <p>“We have busi­ness there and Italy is where I was born, but Sin­ga­pore is our base and a very beau­ti­ful coun­try, and I in­tend to ap­ply to be­come a per­ma­nent res­i­dent.”</p>
