    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) pi­lots have agreed to take deeper pay cuts of up to 50 per cent so that more of them can stay em­ployed.</p>
    <p>This is on top of a 10 per cent cut in the monthly vari­able com­po­nent (MVC) of their salaries, The Straits Times has learnt.</p>
    <p>With the new agree­ment reached be­tween SIA and the Air Line Pi­lots As­so­ci­a­tion – Sin­ga­pore (Alpa-S), re-em­ployed cap­tains and first of­fi­cers will see their salaries cut by 60 per cent and 50 per cent, re­spec­tively, start­ing on Oct 1. This in­cludes the 10 per cent MVC cut.</p>
    <p>Other cap­tains will take pay cuts of up to 28.5 per cent, while first of­fi­cers will take pay cuts of up to 18.5 per cent, de­pend­ing on their cur­rent pay.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­nal cir­cu­lar – a copy of which was seen by The Straits Times – the pi­lots were told: “We are pleased to an­nounce that a me­moran­dum of agree­ment was signed with Alpa-S ef­fec­tive 1 Oc­to­ber 2020 to 31 March 2022 on ad­di­tional pay cuts to avoid fur­ther job losses.”</p>
    <p>This latest agree­ment su­per­sedes the pre­vi­ous one dated Aug 6, said SIA’s se­nior vice-pres­i­dent of flight op­er­a­tions Quay Chew Eng and Alpa-S pres­i­dent Ken­neth Lai.</p>
    <p>The pay cuts will be re­viewed and ad­justed if fly­ing hours in­crease, the pi­lots were told.</p>
    <p>An SIA spokesman con­firmed that an agree­ment has been reached.</p>
    <p>He said yes­ter­day: “As per to­day’s agree­ment, the com­pany will im­ple­ment ad­di­tional pay cuts for all re­main­ing pi­lots in Sin­ga­pore Air­lines and SilkAir with ef­fect from Oct 1. As a re­sult, this agree­ment will help to mit­i­gate fur­ther job losses for our pi­lots.</p>
    <p>“The SIA Group is fo­cused on nav­i­gat­ing and over­com­ing the chal­lenges ahead of us in this ex­tremely un­cer­tain op­er­at­ing cli­mate.”</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that SIA, which has about 2,600 pi­lots, has re­trenched about 50 of them, mainly for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>The air­line has said it ex­pects to op­er­ate at un­der 50 per cent of its ca­pac­ity at the end of this fis­cal year, com­pared with pre-Covid-19 lev­els.</p>
    <p>It now op­er­ates at about 8 per cent of its pas­sen­ger ca­pac­ity com­pared with be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>SIA is cur­rently in the process of down­siz­ing its work­force.</p>
    <p>It an­nounced last week that it would cut around 4,300 po­si­tions, and this in­cluded let­ting go 2,400 staff in a re­trench­ment ex­er­cise that started on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, it was re­ported that SIA had let go about half of its cadet pi­lots and cabin crew trainees.</p>
    <p>The rest will have to leave af­ter their train­ing is com­pleted.</p>
    <p>The air­line said it will be un­able to keep them af­ter that due to the cur­rent sur­plus in staff num­bers.</p>
