    <p>At least one in­fec­tious coro­n­avirus pa­tient had vis­ited sev­eral places in Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity (NTU) be­tween Aug 25 and 28, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Three lo­ca­tions in the univer­sity were added to a list of places vis­ited by coro­n­avirus pa­tients while they were in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>They are: Quad Cafe at NTU’s School of Bi­o­log­i­cal Sciences, Korean eatery Paik’s Bibim in NTU’s North Spine Plaza, and the North Spine Food Court.</p>
    <p>Also newly added to the list were food­court Essen at The Pin­na­cle @</p>
    <p>Dux­ton, Yuhua Market and Hawker Cen­tre and Apgu­jeong Hair Stu­dio in Jem.</p>
    <p>MOH pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes and the times they vis­ited them, to get peo­ple who were at those places at the same time to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>The full list of lo­ca­tions and times can be found on MOH’s web­site.</p>
    <p>The min­istry has said close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied, and that there is no need to avoid th­ese places as they would have been cleaned if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>A new clus­ter in a dor­mi­tory was also an­nounced yes­ter­day. MOH said one of the newly con­firmed cases is linked to 13 pre­vi­ous cases, form­ing a new clus­ter at S11 Dor­mi­tory @ Pung­gol, lo­cated at 2 Sele­tar North Link.</p>
    <p>Among the 47 new cases re­ported yes­ter­day, one was an im­ported case. The one-year-old Sin­ga­porean baby ar­rived from In­dia on Aug 24. He had been placed on a 14-day stay-home no­tice upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, and was tested while serv­ing the no­tice at a ded­i­cated fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 46 new coro­n­avirus pa­tients an­nounced yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,091.</p>
    <p>Of the 46, 25 had been iden­ti­fied ear­lier as con­tacts of pre­vi­ous cases, and had al­ready been quar­an­tined to pre­vent fur­ther trans­mis­sion. They were tested dur­ing their quar­an­tine pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing 21 cases were de­tected through sur­veil­lance test­ing, such as bi­weekly ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from three cases two weeks ago to two in the past week.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has in­creased from a daily av­er­age of one case to two cases over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 53 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 56,446 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 48 pa­tients re­mained in hos­pi­tal yes­ter­day, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 555 were re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from three cases two weeks ago to two in the past week. How­ever, the num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has in­creased from a daily av­er­age of one case to two cases over the same pe­riod.</p>
