    <p>Based on find­ings from in­de­pen­dent sur­veys con­ducted in the sec­ond half of the year, Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings (SPH) has reg­is­tered favourable lis­ten­er­ship num­bers across all of its five ra­dio sta­tions man­aged and op­er­ated by the group’s sub­sidiary, SPH Ra­dio.</p>
    <p>In the lat­est Nielsen Ra­dio Di­ary Sur­vey, Kiss92 saw an in­crease i n over­all lis­ten­er­ship, with the high­est exclusive lis­ten­er­ship of 160,000 weekly.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey in­di­cated that the sta­tion has es­tab­lished the largest base of young au­di­ences between 20 and 29 years old, and was also the English sta­tion with the high­est reach among au­di­ences be­low 40 years old.</p>
    <p>ONE FM 91.3 demon­strated strong ap­peal among the mass af­flu­ent, ac­cord­ing to the sur­vey. Com­pared with its peers, the English ra­dio sta­tion’s core au­di­ence had the high­est me­dian per­sonal in­come at $6,694.</p>
    <p>Some 90 per cent of the sta­tion’s core lis­ten­ers are pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and busi­ness­men (PMEBs), while 54 per cent are pri­vate prop­erty dwellers.</p>
    <p>Find­ings by Nielsen also showed a dou­bling in lis­ten­er­ship for Money FM 89.3, which had the high­est reach to car own­ers (60 per cent) and gro­cery buy­ers (79 per cent) in its core au­di­ence of PMEBs between ages 35 and 54.</p>
    <p>In a press state­ment yes­ter­day, SPH Ra­dio said the sta­tion’s emerg­ing base of loyal lis­ten­ers is a clear in­di­ca­tion that au­di­ences are turn­ing to Money FM 89.3 as their trusted source for busi­ness and per­sonal fi­nance up­dates.</p>
    <p>UFM100.3 came in sec­ond in its core au­di­ence time spent lis­ten­ing at nine hours and 26 min­utes weekly. Among the Chi­nese ra­dio sta­tions sur­veyed by Nielsen, UFM100.3 lis­ten­ers have the high­est house­hold and per­sonal me­dian i ncomes at $6,379 and $3,272 re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey also re­flected a 13 per cent in­crease in over­all lis­ten­er­ship for Chi­nese ra­dio sta­tion 96.3 Hao FM, which reg­is­tered the high­est growth in core au­di­ence time spent lis­ten­ing. On av­er­age, lis­ten­ers tuned in one hour and 56 min­utes longer each week.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate study in­volv­ing more than 2,000 re­spon­dents and con­ducted in Oc­to­ber by in­de­pen­dent lo­cal con­sumer in­sights com­pany Mi­lieu In­sights, Kiss92 was named the most-liked sta­tion in Sin­ga­pore, while Money FM 89.3 re­tained its top spot with its in­flu­ence on pur­chas­ing de­ci­sions at 65 per cent.</p>
    <p>Both sur­veys by Nielsen and Mi­lieu sug­gested ra­dio was a key me­dia chan­nel dur­ing the pan­demic, with Nielsen re­port­ing a 1.7 per cent in­crease in au­di­ence share.</p>
    <p>Some 74 per cent of re­spon­dents for the Mi­lieu study agreed they had been lis­ten­ing to the ra­dio more of­ten af­ter the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion es­ca­lated ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>SPH Ra­dio sta­tions’ pod­cast down­loads went up by al­most twofold dur­ing this pe­riod, high­light­ing that pod­casts were a grow­ing favourite au­dio for­mat. The healthy av­er­age monthly growth in down­loads of 37 per cent was largely driven by Money FM 89.3 pod­casts and 96.3 Hao FM pod­casts at 162 per cent and 106 per cent re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>App and Web stream­ers con­tin­ued to be well re­ceived among lis­ten­ers. Data from Tri­ton Dig­i­tal showed that SPH Ra­dio saw an over­all dig­i­tal stream­ing growth dur­ing the sec­ond half of the year, led by 96.3 Hao FM and Money FM 89.3 at 20 per cent and 16 per cent re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>SPH Ra­dio gen­eral man­ager Sim Hong Huat said he found the sur­vey re­sults “en­cour­ag­ing”, and that he was “pleased with the over­all pos­i­tive re­sults” across the ra­dio net­work.</p>
    <p>“We are very grate­ful for the sup­port of our fans and part­ners, and will con­tinue to work hard at de­liv­er­ing bet­ter con­sumer ex­pe­ri­ences, which in­clude more in­ter­ac­tive fea­tures in-app in the fol­low­ing months, de­signed with our lis­ten­ers in mind for an en­gag­ing dig­i­tal ex­pe­ri­ence,” he added.</p>
