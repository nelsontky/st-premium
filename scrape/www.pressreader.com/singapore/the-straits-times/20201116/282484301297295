    <p>• Tokyo Olympics or­gan­is­ers will wel­come Thomas Bach to­day with a spring in their step, but the In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee (IOC) pres­i­dent is sure to ask de­mand­ing ques­tions in pri­vate, even if his sup­port re­mains un­wa­ver­ing in pub­lic.</p>
    <p>The visit will be the Ger­man’s first to the Ja­panese cap­i­tal since he and then Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe in March de­cided to post­pone the Games for the first time be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pandemic.</p>
    <p>His ar­rival comes after Tokyo over a week ago hosted a suc­cess­ful in­ter­na­tional gym­nas­tics meet where a va­ri­ety of Covid-19 counter-mea­sures were tested, and with news of a po­ten­tially suc­cess­ful vac­cine from Pfizer on the hori­zon.</p>
    <p>In a video mes­sage broad­cast dur­ing the four-na­tion gym­nas­tics event, Bach said the event gave con­fi­dence that the Games can go ahead next year, even if it has to be held with re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the post­pone­ment de­ci­sion, Bach praised Tokyo as the “most pre­pared” host city he had ex­pe­ri­enced and the 1976 Mon­treal Games fenc­ing gold medal­list in team foil is ex­pected to con­vey a sim­i­larly pos­i­tive mes­sage this time around.</p>
    <p>How­ever, de­spite what Bach may say in pub­lic dur­ing his two­day trip, he will also be push­ing Tokyo 2020 or­gan­is­ers to for­mu­late con­crete plans for the re­ar­ranged Games and en­act fur­ther cost-re­duc­tion mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The two key ar­eas Bach will want to hash out with the or­gan­is­ers are whether spec­ta­tors will be al­lowed in venues, and how best to safely ac­com­mo­date over 11,000 ath­letes ar­riv­ing in Tokyo from across the world.</p>
    <p>“It (the trip) is im­por­tant be­cause we are now com­ing to a cru­cial stage of putting this tool­box to­gether with Covid-19 coun­ter­mea­sures to get the feel­ing what will be needed next year,” he said last week.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the visit, the Ger­man is ex­pected to meet Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga and will award his pre­de­ces­sor Abe the Olympic Or­der, the IOC’s high­est ac­co­lade, for his sup­port of the Games.</p>
    <p>Bach will also meet Tokyo Gov­er­nor Yuriko Koike, visit the newly built Na­tional Sta­dium, and hold a news con­fer­ence along­side Tokyo 2020 or­gan­is­ers.</p>
