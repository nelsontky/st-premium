    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans should be per­turbed by the an­nounce­ment ear­lier this week that the In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity Depart­ment had in­ves­ti­gated 37 in­di­vid­u­als, 14 of them Sin­ga­pore­ans, in the wake of the re­cent ter­ror at­tacks in France. These peo­ple were in­volved in in­cit­ing vi­o­lence and stok­ing com­mu­nal un­rest, or made deroga­tory re­marks against Mus­lims. Six­teen for­eign­ers have been repa­tri­ated, while in­ves­ti­ga­tions into the re­main­ing 21 in­di­vid­u­als, in­clud­ing a rad­i­calised Bangladesh­i worker ar­rested un­der the In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity Act, are on­go­ing. These de­vel­op­ments show that the threat of rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion, which could lead to ac­tual at­tacks un­less de­tected and de­fanged early, con­tin­ues to be a menace here.</p>
    <p>The irony is that rad­i­calised res­i­dents, whether Sin­ga­pore­ans or for­eign­ers, have acted on the ba­sis of events else­where – de­vel­op­ments over which Sin­ga­pore has no con­trol and for which it is not re­spon­si­ble: for ex­am­ple, the at­tacks in France last month, which in­cluded the be­head­ing of teacher Sa­muel Paty by a man aveng­ing the teacher’s class­room use of re­li­gious car­i­ca­tures deemed blas­phe­mous. Sin­ga­pore played no role in ei­ther the per­ceived provo­ca­tion or the con­se­quent vendetta. The suf­fer­ings of Mus­lims in Syria or else­where are real but, again, Sin­ga­pore does not con­trib­ute to them.</p>
    <p>Yet, so­ci­ety and the au­thor­i­ties here have of­ten had to con­tend with the fall­out from such in­ci­dents. What this un­der­lines is the far reach of ma­lig­nant echo cham­bers, and the am­pli­fi­ca­tion on­line of mis­guided views, dis­torted teach­ings and hate speech. In­su­lat­ing com­mu­ni­ties as much as is pos­si­ble from the mis­rep­re­sen­ta­tion of events else­where can help, but only up to a point, given the reach of the In­ter­net. What is im­por­tant is hav­ing cred­i­ble voices here to counter the on­slaught, in­clud­ing by re­mind­ing that Mus­lim com­mu­nity mem­bers here have al­ways been free to prac­tise their faith in peace and in har­mony with other re­li­gious com­mu­ni­ties. Mus­lims should also ap­pre­ci­ate that the Sin­ga­pore au­thor­i­ties would not al­low the pub­li­ca­tion of re­li­giously of­fen­sive car­toons un­der the guise of freedom of speech.</p>
    <p>What must also be made clear is that any­one who chooses to bring some­one else’s con­flict into Sin­ga­pore will be dealt with. Rad­i­cals and ex­trem­ists are not ex­clu­sive to any re­li­gion. Sec­u­lar and re­li­gious lead­ers have to work con­stantly to keep the main­stream of all faiths here free of con­tam­i­na­tion from im­ported rad­i­cal­ism. More im­por­tant, how­ever, must be the role that the com­mu­nity, fam­ily and friends them­selves play to spot, coun­sel and alert – not to ig­nore and turn a blind eye to a re­al­ity that they may see un­fold­ing at home or in the work­place. They are ev­ery bit as re­spon­si­ble for stop­ping some­one they know from fall­ing prey to re­li­gious ex­trem­ism.</p>
