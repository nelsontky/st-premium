    <p>Two telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions com­pa­nies here were hit with fines to­talling $610,000 for caus­ing In­ter­net ser­vice dis­rup­tions dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod which af­fected many Sin­ga­pore­ans work­ing from home or at­tend­ing home­based learn­ing.</p>
    <p>M1 was is­sued a fi­nan­cial penalty of $400,000 for broad­band ser­vice dis­rup­tions in May, while StarHub was given a penalty of $210,000 for sim­i­lar dis­rup­tions in April.</p>
    <p>An­nounc­ing this in a re­lease yes­ter­day, the In­fo­comm Me­dia Devel­op­ment Au­thor­ity (IMDA) said the tel­cos had con­tra­vened the 2016 Code of Prac­tice for Telecom­mu­ni­ca­tion Ser­vice Re­silience.</p>
    <p>“In de­ter­min­ing the fi­nal penalty quan­tum for each in­ci­dent, IMDA took into con­sid­er­a­tion rel­e­vant fac­tors such as the du­ra­tion, im­pact and cus­tomer ser­vice mea­sures adopted by the op­er­a­tors to mit­i­gate im­pact,” IMDA said.</p>
    <p>In M1’s case, the au­thor­ity said that an is­sue with a cor­rupted pro­file data­base in the telco’s broad­band net­work gateway dis­rupted ser­vices for some 18,000 sub­scribers for 23 hours from 7am on May 12 to 6am on May 13.</p>
    <p>There was also a sec­ond M1 dis­rup­tion on May 13 af­ter a soft­ware fault oc­curred in the telco’s net­work equip­ment. It af­fected the rout­ing of In­ter­net traf­fic for some 20,000 sub­scribers for six hours.</p>
    <p>In its in­ves­ti­ga­tions, IMDA said the first in­ci­dent oc­curred be­cause M1’s staff and ven­dor had not fol­lowed pre­scribed pro­ce­dures, but added that the telco could not have rea­son­ably fore­seen or pre­vented the sec­ond in­ci­dent as it was the “first of its kind” for such equip­ment. M1 had thus breached reg­u­la­tions for the first in­ci­dent and not the sec­ond one, said IMDA.</p>
    <p>It added that in de­ter­min­ing the $400,000 penalty, the au­thor­ity con­sid­ered that the dis­rup­tion lasted al­most a full day, which caused sig­nif­i­cant in­con­ve­nience to af­fected sub­scribers.</p>
    <p>IMDA also fac­tored in M1’s com­pen­sa­tion ef­forts to af­fected sub­scribers fol­low­ing the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>In StarHub’s case, the au­thor­ity said the dis­rup­tions on April 15 oc­curred when one of the telco’s staff made a con­fig­u­ra­tion er­ror dur­ing a planned net­work mi­gra­tion ex­er­cise. IMDA found that the in­ci­dent, which af­fected up to 250,000 peo­ple, could have been pre­vented if StarHub had bet­ter su­per­vised its staff.</p>
    <p>In de­cid­ing the penalty, IMDA had con­sid­ered StarHub’s ef­forts to quickly re­store ser­vices, and its prompt com­mu­ni­ca­tion and com­pen­sa­tion to af­fected sub­scribers.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, M1 apol­o­gised for the in­con­ve­nience caused by the dis­rup­tions and thanked cus­tomers for their pa­tience and un­der­stand­ing.</p>
    <p>It said it will be in­vest­ing in a cloud-based call cen­tre plat­form that can man­age in­creased call loads and lower its re­sponse time.</p>
    <p>StarHub said it re­gret­ted the dis­rup­tions to its ser­vice and noted that it has im­ple­mented ad­di­tional mea­sures to pre­vent such an in­ci­dent from hap­pen­ing again.</p>
    <p>IMDA’s deputy chief ex­ec­u­tive Aileen Chia said the au­thor­ity takes a se­ri­ous view of any ser­vice dis­rup­tion to pub­lic tele­coms ser­vices, par­tic­u­larly dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod when most peo­ple were work­ing and study­ing from home.</p>
    <p>She added that IMDA will take firm and de­ci­sive ac­tion to safe­guard its con­sumers’ in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>“Op­er­a­tors must com­mu­ni­cate any ser­vice dif­fi­cul­ties with their cus­tomers and rec­tify in­ci­dents ex­pe­di­tiously, and should pro­vide good ser­vice re­cov­ery mea­sures to af­fected cus­tomers,” said Ms Chia.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tinue to work with op­er­a­tors to strengthen net­work re­silience and im­prove cus­tomer com­mu­ni­ca­tions.”</p>
