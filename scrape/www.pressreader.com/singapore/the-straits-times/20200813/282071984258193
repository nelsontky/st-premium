    <p>The so­cial sec­tor needs lead­ers who can come up with creative ways to help Sin­ga­pore’s vul­ner­a­ble groups, whose lives and liveli­hoods have been up­set by the Covid-19 pan­demic, said Pres­i­dent Halimah Yacob.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent, who was speak­ing to a group of 40 peo­ple aged be­low 40, called on them to be bold and in­no­va­tive as they strive to bring change to the or­gan­i­sa­tions they serve.</p>
    <p>In her ad­dress yes­ter­day dur­ing the Na­tional Coun­cil of So­cial Ser­vice’s (NCSS) 40-Un­der-40 pro­gramme, she also praised Sin­ga­pore’s so­cial ser­vice agen­cies for ris­ing to meet the chal­lenges brought about by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“I’m en­cour­aged by the cre­ativ­ity and re­source­ful­ness (they) have shown dur­ing this pe­riod,” she said, not­ing that some have dig­i­talised their func­tions and pro­grammes, such as en­gag­ing se­niors through video chat.</p>
    <p>Still, Madam Halimah added, the agen­cies need to look into how they can fur­ther col­lab­o­rate across sec­tors and agen­cies to serve their ben­e­fi­cia­ries bet­ter.</p>
    <p>She also said that as agen­cies lever­age more on tech­nol­ogy, they must keep an eye on the is­sue of in­equal­ity.</p>
    <p>“We don’t want to have a sit­u­a­tion where... (it is) a lot harder for those from the lower-in­come house­holds to ac­cess op­por­tu­ni­ties and to have ac­cess to ser­vices,” said Madam Halimah.</p>
    <p>The three-day pro­gramme, which started on Tues­day, is aimed at build­ing a com­mu­nity of young lead­ers em­pow­ered to solve prob­lems and drive change in an­tic­i­pa­tion of a new nor­mal in the post-Covid-19 world. The par­tic­i­pants were nom­i­nated by so­cial ser­vice agen­cies, so­cial en­ter­prises and or­gan­i­sa­tions from the pub­lic and pri­vate sec­tors.</p>
    <p>They also heard yes­ter­day morn­ing from Min­is­ter-in-charge of So­cial Ser­vices In­te­gra­tion Des­mond Lee, who was re­cently ap­pointed Min­is­ter for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment, and will hear from Speaker of Par­lia­ment Tan Chuan-Jin to­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said: “It is timely for our next-gen­er­a­tion lead­ers to gather, iden­tify and ex­am­ine prob­lems grap­pling the so­cial ser­vice sec­tor to­day, draw out col­lec­tive learn­ing and to­gether plan for the fu­ture be­yond the Covid-19 pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>NCSS pres­i­dent Anita Fam said: “In ad­di­tion to be­ing a lead­er­ship fo­rum, the pro­gramme builds a net­work of the next gen­er­a­tion of lead­ers who can, in turn, lever­age each other’s strengths and ex­pe­ri­ences to re­spond to in­creas­ingly com­plex needs.”</p>
    <p>Two young lead­ers – Ms Chen Shiling and Mr Mo­hamed Fa­reez Mo­hamed Fahmy – spoke of their ex­pe­ri­ences in work­ing amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Fa­reez, 39, se­nior as­sis­tant di­rec­tor at AMKFSC Com­mu­nity Ser­vices, a so­cial ser­vice agency that serves res­i­dents in Ang Mo Kio, said one ma­jor prob­lem fam­i­lies face is not hav­ing ba­sic equip­ment for home-based learn­ing.</p>
    <p>“We re­alised that hav­ing Wi-Fi and a tablet or com­puter is ac­tu­ally a ba­sic need for ev­ery house­hold... and this be­came even more em­pha­sised dur­ing this Covid-19 pan­demic,” he added.</p>
    <p>Ms Chen, 38, head of Hua Mei In­tel­lec­tual Dis­abil­ity Ser­vice at non­profit or­gan­i­sa­tion Tsao Foun­da­tion, said the pan­demic has been a clear re­minder of how a sit­u­a­tion can change swiftly and sud­denly.</p>
    <p>She hopes to see greater in­te­gra­tion in the so­cial ser­vice sec­tor as well as across sec­tors. “It will ac­tu­ally bring about more ef­fi­ciency, which is some­thing we need to look at now with Covid-19 and all the re­source lim­i­ta­tions.”</p>
    <p>PRAISE FOR AGEN­CIES’ EF­FORTS</p>
    <p>I’m en­cour­aged by the cre­ativ­ity and re­source­ful­ness (they) have shown dur­ing this pe­riod. ’’</p>
    <p>PRES­I­DENT HALIMAH YACOB, prais­ing Sin­ga­pore’s so­cial ser­vice agen­cies for ris­ing to meet the chal­lenges brought about by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
