    <p>Malaysia was thrown into po­lit­i­cal tur­moil last night af­ter Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin met Malaysia’s King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah, to dis­cuss im­pos­ing emer­gency mea­sures, but a much an­tic­i­pated an­nounce­ment of the move over tele­vi­sion failed to ma­te­ri­alise.</p>
    <p>This sparked spec­u­la­tion that Tan Sri Muhyid­din might make the an­nounce­ment at the week­end, ahead of the open­ing of mar­kets on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The move ap­pears to be aimed at en­sur­ing that the up­com­ing vote in Par­lia­ment on the Bud­get does not re­sult in snap elec­tions if it fails to pass. The gov­ern­ment is also try­ing to buy time to deal with the resur­gent cases of Covid-19 in parts of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The con­sti­tu­tional monarch’s con­sent is needed to in­voke emer­gency pow­ers.</p>
    <p>The day’s frenzy of ac­tiv­i­ties be­gan when Mr Muhyid­din chaired a spe­cial Cabi­net meet­ing yes­ter­day morn­ing in the ad­min­is­tra­tive cap­i­tal Pu­tra­jaya to dis­cuss the emer­gency mea­sures, The Straits Times was in­formed by its sources.</p>
    <p>The spe­cial meet­ing was at</p>
    <p>tended by armed forces chief Af­fendi Buang, In­spec­tor-Gen­eral of Po­lice Ab­dul Hamid Bador and At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Idrus Harun.</p>
    <p>Af­ter se­cur­ing his min­is­ters’ ap­proval to put the mat­ter be­fore the King for royal as­sent, Mr Muhyid­din rushed to Kuan­tan in the east­ern Pa­hang state for his royal au­di­ence with the monarch.</p>
    <p>His mo­tor­cade was seen en­ter­ing the palace grounds around 4.45pm.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din emerged more than two hours later and flew back to Kuala Lumpur, but did not make any an­nounce­ment on the mea­sures.</p>
    <p>It is un­der­stood that the King will first con­sult the coun­try’s eight other state rulers be­fore ar­riv­ing at a de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din holds a slim ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment and fail­ure to pass the Bud­get, which is sched­uled to be tabled on Nov 6, would be tan­ta­mount to a no-con­fi­dence vote in his gov­ern­ment and could trig­ger snap polls.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers have said that hold­ing a gen­eral elec­tion amid Malaysia’s resur­gent wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions could prove dis­as­trous.</p>
    <p>Sources with knowl­edge of th­ese dis­cus­sions told ST that an “eco­nomic emer­gency” could be pro­claimed to en­sure that gov­ern­ment spend­ing to curb Covid-19 – to­tal num­ber of cases of the dis­ease dou­bled this month alone – is not jeop­ar­dised by an in­creas­ingly un­sta­ble po­lit­i­cal at­mos­phere.</p>
    <p>“It will not be sim­i­lar to the cur­fews and mil­i­tary pres­ence we had af­ter the 1969 race ri­ots.</p>
    <p>“In­stead, nor­mal life un­der the move­ment con­trol or­der will con­tinue, with­out pol­i­tics get­ting in the way of deal­ing with a health cri­sis,” one source said on the con­di­tion of anonymity.</p>
    <p>The Star news­pa­per quoted of­fi­cials in Pu­tra­jaya as say­ing that only po­lit­i­cal ac­tiv­i­ties would be af­fected by any state of emer­gency be­ing de­clared.</p>
    <p>“It will be busi­ness as usual. Eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties will carry on and there will be no cur­fews.</p>
    <p>“In a nut­shell, life goes on as we know it,” the source said.</p>
    <p>The move­ment con­trols were rein­tro­duced on Oct 14 in the cap­i­tal Kuala Lumpur, and in the states of Se­lan­gor and Sabah, af­ter new daily cases reached record highs of close to 900 cases.</p>
    <p>A top min­is­te­rial aide told ST that the Cabi­net’s de­ci­sion to in­voke emer­gency pow­ers was brought to the Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil meet­ing yes­ter­day af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>“The spe­cial Cabi­net meet­ing was to en­sure we have a Bud­get 2021 that can be im­ple­mented. We have to wait for the Prime Min­is­ter’s au­di­ence with the King,” he said.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim, who re­cently claimed that he has suf­fi­cient sup­port from law­mak­ers in the 222-strong Par­lia­ment to form a new gov­ern­ment, crit­i­cised the plan, say­ing that Mr Muhyid­din’s ad­min­is­tra­tion is us­ing the Covid-19 cri­sis as an ex­cuse to jus­tify its abuse of power.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment has failed to pro­vide strong lead­er­ship in han­dling this cri­sis and is in­stead re­sort­ing to un­demo­cratic means to stay in power,” said Datuk Seri An­war.</p>
    <p>ST un­der­stands that the po­lice and armed forces chiefs and the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral who at­tended yes­ter­day’s spe­cial Cabi­net meet­ing were also con­sulted ear­lier in the week, af­ter health of­fi­cials ve­he­mently ar­gued that a na­tional elec­tion should not be held un­til the coro­n­avirus out­break is con­tained.</p>
    <p>Last month’s state polls in Sabah set off new in­fec­tion clus­ters, which now ac­count for the ma­jor­ity of new cases recorded in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has seen over 800 daily new in­fec­tions re­ported sev­eral times this week, far more than pre­vi­ous highs of just over 200.</p>
    <p>Elec­tion Com­mis­sion chief Ab­dul Ghani Salleh had said on Oct 13 that “in the light of the out­break, we urge, if pos­si­ble, that no elec­tion be held dur­ing this pe­riod”.</p>
    <p>The Fed­eral Con­sti­tu­tion al­lows for an emer­gency to be called with the con­sent of the King.</p>
    <p>An “eco­nomic emer­gency” could be pro­claimed to en­sure that gov­ern­ment spend­ing to curb Covid-19... is not jeop­ar­dised by an in­creas­ingly un­sta­ble po­lit­i­cal at­mos­phere...</p>
    <p>The Star news­pa­per quoted of­fi­cials in Pu­tra­jaya as say­ing that only po­lit­i­cal ac­tiv­i­ties would be af­fected... “It will be busi­ness as usual. Eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties will carry on and there will be no cur­fews. In a nut­shell, life goes on as we know it,” the source said.</p>
