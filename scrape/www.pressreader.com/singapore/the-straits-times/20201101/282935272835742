    <p>• New Zealand served up a Hal­loween night­mare for an in­ex­pe­ri­enced Wal­la­bies side by romp­ing to a record 43-5 vic­tory in the Tri-Na­tions opener yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The ruth­less All Blacks re­tained the Bledis­loe Cup for an 18th straight year by blitz­ing a young Aus­tralian team to re­in­force their trans-Tas­man dom­i­nance.</p>
    <p>Af­ter win­ning 27-7 in Auck­land, which fol­lowed a tense 16-16 draw in Welling­ton, they ac­com­plished their mis­sion in Syd­ney by their big­gest win­ning mar­gin against the Wal­la­bies, with one match of the se­ries to go next week.</p>
    <p>Fly-half Richie Mo’unga bagged 23 points to en­sure brag­ging rights went to New Zealand coach Ian Fos­ter who, like his op­po­site num­ber Dave Ren­nie, is in charge for his first Bledis­loe Cup tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>“It’s more than a re­lief, it’s ex­cit­ing,” said All Blacks cap­tain Sam Cane, adding that the team would cel­e­brate with “a few fizzies”.</p>
    <p>“It’s a lot of feel­ings but I’m just re­ally proud of the group and ex­cited about what’s ahead.”</p>
    <p>Mo’unga scored two bril­liant in­di­vid­ual tries in six first-half min­utes and for­wards Karl Tu’inukuafe and Dane Coles also crossed as the vis­i­tors raced to a 26-0 lead in just half an hour.</p>
    <p>While the match was the third Bledis­loe fix­ture, it was also the first of the Tri Na­tions – also fea­tur­ing Ar­gentina – re­branded from the Rugby Cham­pi­onship af­ter world cham­pi­ons South Africa pulled out.</p>
    <p>In front of just 25,000 fans at a wet ANZ Sta­dium, fewer than the 38,000 al­lowed un­der Covid-19 rules, the All Blacks over­whelmed the Wal­la­bies in a breath­less first half that saw two yel­low cards, four tries and two dis­al­lowed tries.</p>
    <p>A ragged Aus­tralia were for­tu­nate to be down only 26-0 at the break and there was no way back for Ren­nie’s men.</p>
    <p>The pain eased for the home crowd early in the sec­ond half when Aus­tralia fly­half Noah Lole­sio scored a try on his Test de­but, but Rieko Ioane and Jordie Bar­rett blew out the score in the last 10 min­utes.</p>
    <p>Mo’unga con­verted five of six tries and added a penalty to en­sure the high­est vic­tory mar­gin for the All Blacks in 169 Tests against their neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>New Zealand were phys­i­cally too strong and again ex­posed the frail­ties of Aus­tralia’s de­fen­sive wall. The hosts badly missed the calm­ing pres­ence of ex­pe­ri­enced backs Matt To’omua and James O’Con­nor, who were both in­jured.</p>
    <p>“We’re hurt­ing a lot from that,” said Wal­la­bies cap­tain Michael Hooper. “It’s a hit to the con­fi­dence now. We’re go­ing to go look back at stick­ing to our game plan, we got out on the field and we changed di­rec­tion.”</p>
