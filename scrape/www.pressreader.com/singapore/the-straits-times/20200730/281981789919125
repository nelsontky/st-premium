    <p>WASH­ING­TON • At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Wil­liam Barr on Tues­day par­ried at­tacks in the Demo­cratic-led House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives, deny­ing ac­cu­sa­tions that he is do­ing United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s bid­ding by in­ter­ven­ing in high-pro­file cases and send­ing fed­eral agents into US cities.</p>
    <p>He tes­ti­fied to the House Ju­di­ciary Com­mit­tee for the first time since tak­ing of­fice in Fe­bru­ary last year as the Jus­tice De­part­ment faces crit­i­cism for send­ing fed­eral of­fi­cers to forcibly dis­perse an­tiracism protesters in Port­land, Ore­gon, and Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>Com­mit­tee Democrats re­peat­edly in­ter­rupted Mr Barr, of­ten run­ning out the clock be­fore he could an­swer their ques­tions and draw­ing crit­i­cism from Mr Barr’s fel­low Repub­li­cans, who re­sponded by let­ting him ad­dress the Democrats’ crit­i­cism dur­ing their own al­lot­ted time to ask ques­tions – a tac­tic that made it eas­ier for Mr Barr to stay on mes­sage.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing an ex­change about the de­ploy­ment of fed­eral agents to Port­land, where they have clashed nightly with anti-racism demon­stra­tors who have also set fires and thrown ob­jects, Mr Barr re­sponded: “We can­not j ust stand aside and watch the fed­eral court­house be de­stroyed.”</p>
    <p>Com­mit­tee chair­man Jer­rold Nadler opened the hear­ing by telling Mr Barr: “Your ten­ure is marked by a per­sis­tent war against the de­part­ment’s pro­fes­sional core in an ap­par­ent ef­fort to se­cure favours for the Pres­i­dent.”</p>
    <p>Mr Barr re­jected Mr Nadler’s as­ser­tion that the de­ploy­ment of fed­eral agents to US cities was an ef­fort to boost Mr Trump’s re-elec­tion cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Mr Barr also de­nied tak­ing ac­tions to help Mr Trump’s as­so­ci­ates, say­ing they do not de­serve spe­cial breaks but also should not be treated more harshly than other de­fen­dants.</p>
    <p>The de­part­ment’s in­ter­nal watchdog launched probes last week into fed­eral in­volve­ment in the Port­land and Wash­ing­ton protests.</p>
    <p>Wide­spread and mostly peace­ful protests against racial bias and po­lice bru­tal­ity have taken place in the US since May 25 when Mr Ge­orge Floyd, a black man, died un­der the knee of a white of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>Mr Barr has high­lighted the ar­son and vi­o­lence at some protests, blam­ing them pri­mar­ily on far-left “an­tifa” el­e­ments – an as­ser­tion that is heav­ily dis­puted – and urg­ing fed­eral prosecutor­s to bring crim­i­nal charges when­ever pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Com­mit­tee Repub­li­cans – in­clud­ing rank­ing mem­ber Jim Jor­dan – high­lighted the de­gree to which Democrats did not al­low Mr Barr to speak.</p>
    <p>Some Demo­cratic po­lit­i­cal com­men­ta­tors said the Democrats’ style of ques­tion­ing had made it eas­ier for Mr Barr to avoid ma­jor mis­steps, in­stead high­light­ing scenes of vi­o­lence at protests that have fac­tored promi­nently in Mr Trump’s cam­paign ads.</p>
    <p>“Barr is hav­ing a great day re-an­nounc­ing the Trump re-elec­tion strat­egy,” said Mr Hank Sheinkopf, a vet­eran Demo­cratic Party po­lit­i­cal con­sul­tant. He said Mr Barr’s tes­ti­mony likely would help Mr Trump in his bid to win over cru­cial sub­ur­ban vot­ers.</p>
