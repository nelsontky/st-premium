    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, when Ms Shaza Ishak went shop­ping for gro­ceries, she no­ticed plants wilt­ing out­side a gar­den cen­tre in her Be­dok neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>She had toyed with the idea of buy­ing plants there be­fore Covid-19 hit, but fig­ured that she and her two flat­mates were too busy for gar­den­ing.</p>
    <p>But see­ing the dy­ing plants “was de­press­ing”, says the man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of the­atre com­pany Teater Eka­ma­tra. She de­cided to buy some to stop them from dy­ing, and also be­cause she had more time to tend to them since she was work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>The gar­den cen­tre was shut­tered, but there was a num­ber to call. She got in touch with the owner, who let her have some plants for a low price.</p>
    <p>Af­ter mak­ing the nec­es­sary e-pay­ments, Ms Shaza, 31, be­came a plant par­ent. Just like a new mama, she has given her plant ba­bies names and sends their pho­tos to her friends.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing at home all the time, the plants be­came a bit of an ob­ses­sion, as well as a way for my house­mates and me to bond,” says Ms Shaza, who is sin­gle.</p>
    <p>From hav­ing zero fo­liage, her four-room HDB flat now hosts 25 plants, in­clud­ing cacti, hoya and fi­cus plants, a fish­bone fern and a small olive tree.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the day, some of the plants are ro­tated ev­ery few hours around the flat for op­ti­mum sun­light.</p>
    <p>She even has an Ex­cel spread­sheet keep­ing track of when the plants were last wa­tered and re­pot­ted. She has also ex­changed mint and curry plants with her friends via de­liv­ery ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The ben­e­fits of her new hobby are man­i­fold. She has learnt to be more pa­tient, for one thing.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause plants grow so slowly, it’s a whole new un­der­stand­ing of the phrase, de­layed grat­i­fi­ca­tion,” she says.</p>
    <p>“Be­sides, you can give all your love to plants, but they can still die on you... It ma­tures you. It’s 50 per cent about ef­fort; the other 50 per cent is up to your ‘child’.”</p>
    <p>She did not get rid of a plant which had ap­par­ently died and was sur­prised when seedlings sprouted a week later.</p>
    <p>“I feel like all my breaks have been spent hang­ing out with my plants,” says Ms Shaza, who looks for­ward to check­ing on them in the morn­ing to see if there are any new leaves sprout­ing.</p>
    <p>In­door gar­den­ing has been a balm for her now that time feels “rub­bery”, some­times flow­ing fast, some­times slowly, in ways you may not ex­pect, she says.</p>
    <p>Teater Eka­ma­tra has had to let go of two em­ploy­ees due to the pan­demic. She has been work­ing from home for more hours than usual on projects like Baca Skrip, a monthly se­ries of on­line read­ings of Malay plays that will run till next month.</p>
    <p>The up­com­ing ses­sion on Fri­day fea­tures Ikan Can­tik (ikan­can tik.peatix.com), writ­ten by play­wright Aidli Mos­bit, which ex­plores ideas about beauty.</p>
    <p>Ms Shaza says the se­date rhythms of gar­den­ing have a dif­fer­ent qual­ity.</p>
    <p>“It forces you to be slower. There is some fragility to it. I have the time to take a breath and to do it more con­sciously.”</p>
