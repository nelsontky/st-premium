    <p>You have the right skill set, the rel­e­vant work ex­pe­ri­ence and the per­fect cover let­ter, so why are you still not land­ing that j ob in­ter­view? Some­one could be stand­ing in the way of your dream job, and he may not even be hu­man.</p>
    <p>In­creas­ingly, com­pa­nies are us­ing re­sume ro­bots, or soft­ware known as ap­pli­cant track­ing sys­tems (ATS), to sort, screen and rank job ap­pli­ca­tions, at least dur­ing the first round of the hir­ing process.</p>
    <p>With re­trench­ments and un­em­ploy­ment ris­ing amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, com­pa­nies are be­ing flooded with new job ap­pli­ca­tions, ne­ces­si­tat­ing the use of some form of ATS and au­to­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Job­scan, the Seat­tle-based re­sume op­ti­mi­sa­tion com­pany, 99 per cent of For­tune 500 com­pa­nies in the US, such as Nike and Tesla, use some form of ATS to screen ap­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, more than 85 per cent of com­pa­nies with at least 100 em­ploy­ees use some form of ATS, said Mr Adrian Tan, a prac­tice leader at hu­man re­source tech­nol­ogy com­pany Peo­pleStrong.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing in­ter­nal data, he said the pub­lic ser­vice is the largest em­ployer in the Repub­lic that uses an ATS.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan’s firm, which has of­fices in Sin­ga­pore, In­dia and Thai­land, of­fers hu­man re­source dig­i­tal so­lu­tions, in­clud­ing an ATS known as Alt Re­cruit. Even among small and medium-sized en­ter­prises in Sin­ga­pore, 40 per cent have em­braced the tool, said Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>Given how such au­to­mated sys­tems can process a lot of in­for­ma­tion very ef­fi­ciently, they are of­ten used i n the ini­tial screen­ing process to help hu­man re­cruiters save time.</p>
    <p>When re­sumes do get passed to the next round, hir­ing man­agers can then re­view only among, ar­guably, the best ap­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>But there are down­sides.</p>
    <p>Many re­sumes could be re­jected well be­fore they even reach hu­man eyes for vet­ting, sim­ply be­cause they were deemed by the ro­bots to be un­suit­able.</p>
    <p>“Com­pa­nies can miss out on good ap­pli­cants, es­pe­cially if they use ATS that rely only on key­word­match­ing,” said Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>“Any al­ter­na­tive terms on a re­sume may be con­sid­ered to be not fit­ting for the role,” he added.</p>
    <p>A ba­sic ATS works by search­ing for cer­tain key­words to match a job de­scrip­tion, whether in skills or a job ti­tle.</p>
    <p>So if a com­pany is hir­ing a mar­ket­ing man­ager, one of the key­words that the ATS may look out for is “mar­ket­ing man­ager”, which will help to iso­late can­di­dates who have done the ex­act job be­fore.</p>
    <p>Re­sumes that do not in­clude such a term may then be tossed out, even if the ap­pli­cant may have been able to take on the job well.</p>
    <p>A more so­phis­ti­cated ATS goes be­yond key­word-match­ing and uses ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) to look at po­ten­tially hun­dreds of data points, such as the in­dus­try that an ap­pli­cant has worked in be­fore. For ex­am­ple, if most hired can­di­dates for a role come from a cer­tain in­dus­try, the sys­tem may in­fer that peo­ple who have that back­ground would be a good fit.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal lenders DBS Bank and OCBC Bank both use AI dur­ing the ini­tial screen­ing of ap­pli­cants for se­lected roles, they told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>DBS has used its Jobs In­tel­li­gence Mae­stro, or Jim, since 2018 to help re­cruiters hire for high­er­vol­ume roles such as wealth-plan­ning man­agers.</p>
    <p>More re­cently, in June, the bank used the sys­tem for its 500 trainee­ship posts for fresh grad­u­ates, of­fered as part of DBS’ par­tic­i­pa­tion in the SGUnited Trainee­ships Pro­gramme be­ing run in part­ner­ship with the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Jim re­views re­sumes, col­lects ap­pli­cant re­sponses for pre-screen­ing ques­tions, and con­ducts psy­cho­me­t­ric pro­fil­ing as­sess­ments on can­di­dates. From there, it cre­ates a holis­tic re­port of the can­di­date, in­clud­ing scores from the ques­tions and as­sess­ments.</p>
    <p>A re­cruiter will then re­view the re­sults to de­cide if an ap­pli­cant should pro­ceed to a face-to-face in­ter­view with a hir­ing man­ager.</p>
    <p>Ms Susan Cheong, DBS group head of tal­ent ac­qui­si­tion, said: “On av­er­age, re­cruiters now take about eight min­utes to as­sess a can­di­date, com­pared with about 30 min­utes be­fore the bank de­ployed the chat­bot.</p>
    <p>“This frees re­cruiters up for higher value-added tasks, such as sourc­ing for qual­ity can­di­dates, in­ter­view­ing ap­pli­cants, fo­cus­ing on tal­ent ad­vi­sory or even per­sonal up­skilling.”</p>
    <p>She added that about one-third of the can­di­dates who have passed Jim’s vet­ting were of­fered and have ac­cepted roles with DBS, com­pared with only one-sev­enth of the ap­pli­cant pool un­der the old sys­tem which re­lied solely on hu­man re­cruiters.</p>
    <p>Still, both banks noted that their use of such smart sys­tems do not strip the hu­man el­e­ment from the re­cruit­ment process. Hu­mans are still needed to do their own vet­ting of ap­pli­cants, whether it is via in­depth in­ter­views, ref­er­ences or back­ground checks.</p>
    <p>Mr Ernest Phang, OCBC head of cor­po­rate ser­vices for group hu­man re­sources (HR), said: “To com­ple­ment the use of AI, our HR man­agers and hir­ing man­agers will in­ter­view the short­listed ap­pli­cants to en­sure that the po­ten­tial em­ployee has the right skills and ex­pe­ri­ence which best fit the role, as well as val­ues which align with our or­gan­i­sa­tion’s core val­ues.”</p>
    <p>That is why try­ing to beat the sys­tem by do­ing such things as key­word stuff­ing – or shov­ing as many rel­e­vant key­words on a re­sume to please the ATS – will un­likely get the ap­pli­cant the job.</p>
    <p>Ms Be­tul Genc, coun­try man­ager of Adecco Sin­ga­pore, said: “You would still have to go through hu­man in­ter­views with an ex­pert re­cruiter such as hu­man re­sources, your po­ten­tial boss and even team-mates where they can eval­u­ate the ac­cu­racy of your re­sume.”</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, the old-fash­ioned way of build­ing hu­man con­nec­tions may be the key to boost­ing one’s chances of snag­ging a job.</p>
    <p>Man­pow­erGroup Sin­ga­pore coun­try man­ager Linda Teo said: “Be­sides send­ing out ap­pli­ca­tions, job seek­ers can take the ini­tia­tive to net­work with re­cruiters on sites like LinkedIn. But when send­ing a con­nec­tion re­quest, job seek­ers should per­son­alise their mes­sages in­stead of mass e-mail­ing to show their sin­cer­ity.”</p>
    <p>This frees re­cruiters up for higher value-added tasks, such as sourc­ing for qual­ity can­di­dates, in­ter­view­ing ap­pli­cants, fo­cus­ing on tal­ent ad­vi­sory or even per­sonal up­skilling.</p>
