    <p>Pre-school teach­ers can look for­ward to bet­ter and clearer ca­reer paths, with the Early Child­hood De­vel­op­ment Agency (ECDA) con­duct­ing a re­view of how their pro­fes­sional de­vel­op­ment is struc­tured.</p>
    <p>In the con­text of the coro­n­avirus cri­sis, there will also be a stronger em­pha­sis on ed­u­ca­tors’ and pupils’ so­cial and emo­tional well-be­ing, the agency said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Even as more out­door learn­ing is in the works for pupils, an oc­cu­pa­tional health and safety as­sess­ment to im­prove teach­ers’ well-be­ing at their work­place is un­der way.</p>
    <p>More de­tails of the var­i­ous ini­tia­tives will be an­nounced next year.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing on the an­nounce­ments at the first vir­tual Early Child­hood Con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, Min­is­ter for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment Masa­gos Zulkifli, who took over the port­fo­lio in Au­gust, said: “The pri­or­ity is to help all teach­ers deepen their ex­per­tise and de­velop ful­fill­ing ca­reers in the sec­tor.</p>
    <p>“This will ul­ti­mately ben­e­fit both teach­ers and chil­dren.”</p>
    <p>Mr Masa­gos was in the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion in 2006, and had then vis­ited sev­eral coun­tries to study their pre-school sys­tems.</p>
    <p>He said that de­spite the changes and ad­vance­ments made over the years, “our goal has not changed – we want to give ev­ery child a good start in life”.</p>
    <p>ECDA said one key fac­tor in the so­cial-emo­tional de­vel­op­ment of chil­dren is out­door learn­ing and, with Te­masek Foun­da­tion’s sup­port, the agency is launch­ing more cour­ses so that teach­ers can be bet­ter equipped to fa­cil­i­tate this.</p>
    <p>A fund will be set up early next year to help more cen­tres in­tro­duce out­door learn­ing pro­grammes, build­ing on the agency’s ef­forts that be­gan last year, which in­clude the cre­ation of more out­door learn­ing spa­ces in Hous­ing Board es­tates and parks.</p>
    <p>Mrs Pa­tri­cia Koh, chief ex­ec­u­tive of child­care cen­tre Maple Bear, said the out­doors is very im­por­tant for build­ing chil­dren’s con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>She re­calls her time in Aus­tralia when she saw chil­dren climb­ing trees and their par­ents en­cour­ag­ing them to ex­plore na­ture with­out be­ing over­pro­tec­tive of them.</p>
    <p>“It helps them be sure of them­selves with­out wor­ry­ing about fail­ing, es­pe­cially as teach­ers are not giv­ing them scores in the out­doors. If they fall, they will be tended to, and they will get up.”</p>
    <p>She hopes to see more pub­lic spa­ces de­mar­cated for chil­dren’s play.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, lower-in­come fam­i­lies will re­ceive more sup­port in ar­eas such as nu­tri­tion through the ex­pan­sion of KidS­tart, a govern­ment pi­lot pro­gramme started in 2016 to help chil­dren up to six years old from such fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>While it has helped about 1,000 chil­dren to date, the plan is for the scheme to help another 5,000 chil­dren over the next three years, be­gin­ning next year with those liv­ing in Yishun, Sem­bawang and Ang Mo Kio, Mr Masa­gos said.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus cri­sis has in­creased the stress lev­els of teach­ers and forced pre-schools to come up with cre­ative ways to en­sure pupils ad­here to safe dis­tanc­ing and keep their masks on from 7am to 7pm.</p>
    <p>Ms Jamie Ang, chief ex­ec­u­tive of ECDA, told pre-school teach­ers at yes­ter­day’s event: “The work you do is vi­tally im­por­tant but not easy. Do take care of your­self first so that you can con­tinue in this call­ing of help­ing oth­ers.”</p>
