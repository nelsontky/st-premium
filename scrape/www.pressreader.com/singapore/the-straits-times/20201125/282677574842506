    <p>PALLAVI THROUGH AB­STRAC­TIONS Chowk Pro­duc­tions Kalaa Ut­savam – In­dian Fes­ti­val of Arts Sis­tic Live Last Satur­day</p>
    <p>Through the com­puter screen, the stage looks vast, like a float­ing plat­form in a black void.</p>
    <p>Three women ap­pear, dressed sim­ply in long black tops and leg­gings that high­light their feet.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery stamp of the foot re­ver­ber­ates through my speak­ers, along with the sooth­ing notes of a wo­man singing.</p>
    <p>This dance film is a col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween dancer-chore­og­ra­pher Raka Maitra, artis­tic direc­tor of home-grown con­tem­po­rary In­dian dance com­pany Chowk, and film-maker Ler Jiyuan.</p>
    <p>It is the cul­mi­na­tion of the Pallavi se­ries, which be­gan in 2016 and has de­con­structed the gram­mar of the odissi dance form over three it­er­a­tions, ex­am­in­ing its re­la­tion­ship to space, time and still­ness.</p>
    <p>All these ex­plo­rations come to­gether in the film, which makes its pre­miere at the Es­planade’s dig­i­tal Kalaa Ut­savam fes­ti­val, forced on­line by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The min­i­mal set­ting of bod­ies, space and mu­sic gives a greater scope to ap­pre­ci­ate the pu­rity of move­ment and the ab­stract re­la­tion­ships on­stage.</p>
    <p>The pre­ci­sion and sculp­tural poses of odissi trans­late well to a dig­i­tal medium. The an­gles of the el­bows, hips and knees are clearly out­lined on screen, ac­cen­tu­ated by the mo­saic pat­tern cast on the floor by Daryl Soh’s light­ing.</p>
    <p>At some mo­ments, the light­ing draws at­ten­tion to the feet. At oth­ers, it fo­cuses on the space. When it closes in on the dancers, they ap­pear as minia­tures trapped within the screen.</p>
    <p>The cam­era cuts from close-ups of faces and hands to wide shots, vary­ing the rhythm of the watch­ing ex­pe­ri­ence. It draws at­ten­tion to the de­tails of the foot­work and the sheen of per­spi­ra­tion on the dancers’ skin, re­veal­ing their ef­fort even as they ap­pear calm and com­posed.</p>
    <p>The trio of dancers – Maitra, Sand­hya Suresh and Caro­line Chin – move in syn­chrony while ex­hibit­ing supreme con­trol in ev­ery mus­cle, whether stamp­ing to­gether, slowly lift­ing a leg or sub­tly shift­ing the torso. Their bod­ies un­du­late in uni­son from side to side, nei­ther wob­bling nor fal­ter­ing.</p>
    <p>Their gazes hold the viewer’s at­ten­tion com­pletely, with Suresh ap­pear­ing es­pe­cially re­gal as she stares out be­yond the screen, the look in her eyes grad­u­ally soft­en­ing.</p>
    <p>This is clas­si­cal odissi as pure dance, stripped of story and char­ac­ter­i­sa­tion. Yet, there is a wealth of emo­tion in Maitra’s eyes as she al­lows an al­most-smile to grace her lips.</p>
    <p>The film proves a fit­ting con­clu­sion to a ground-break­ing se­ries, cap­tur­ing what came be­fore for pos­ter­ity.</p>
