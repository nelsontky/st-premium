    <p>In the past few months, homegrown de­sign stu­dio Asy­lum has seen its new projects be­ing can­celled or re­as­signed amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The firm, which is be­hind niche as­sign­ments such as the Johnny Walker House in Shang­hai and The Ware­house Ho­tel in Sin­ga­pore, is likely to feel the full im­pact of the Covid-19 cri­sis early next year, said its founder Chris Lee. About 80 per cent of its projects are out­side of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The com­pany, for in­stance, had a few re­quests for ho­tel de­signs in China that came to noth­ing.</p>
    <p>“They waited for us for our recce trip and a kick-off meet­ing, but it never hap­pened in the end be­cause we can’t travel,” the 50-year-old said.</p>
    <p>The firm, which has 18 staff, has not re­sorted to mea­sures such as pay cuts just yet, but is keep­ing a close watch on the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“If all the over­seas projects were to dry up, we would need to down­size and main­tain a skeleton crew.</p>
    <p>Of course, I am hop­ing that it doesn’t hap­pen,” said Mr Lee, adding that most of its ex­ist­ing hos­pi­tal­ity projects are long-term ones, al­low­ing the firm to con­tinue work­ing on them.</p>
    <p>For now, Asy­lum is work­ing on more projects in Sin­ga­pore to ride out these un­cer­tain times.</p>
    <p>“We have taken on new projects that we nor­mally would not do, such as con­do­minium show suites,” said Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>“It is a bless­ing that we are multi-dis­ci­plinary, so we are able to take on dif­fer­ent port­fo­lios dur­ing this pe­riod.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lee, who is mar­ried with a seven-year-old son, has also had to get used to not get­ting on a flight at least three times a month to travel for work. “It was dif­fi­cult ini­tially, but I must say that it has given me un­ex­pected joy. I have more time to spend with my fam­ily and friends.”</p>
    <p>He added: “It is im­por­tant that we re­main highly adapt­able and that we are able to re­act to chang­ing cir­cum­stances.”</p>
