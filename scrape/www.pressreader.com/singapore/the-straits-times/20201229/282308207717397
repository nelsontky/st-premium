    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Paul Ge­orge dis­missed the Los An­ge­les Clip­pers’ 124-73 de­mo­li­tion at the hands of the Dal­las Mav­er­icks as “not that big of a deal” but it is fair to say Kawhi Leonard would have felt dif­fer­ently.</p>
    <p>Leonard, the Fi­nals Most Valu­able Player (MVP) two sea­sons ago, sat out Sun­day’s Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) matchup after get­ting eight stitches in his mouth the game be­fore and a return date has yet to be con­firmed.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he watched the de­ba­cle un­fold at the Sta­ples Cen­tre as the vis­it­ing Mavs pow­ered to a league-record 77-27 lead at half­time.</p>
    <p>Luka Don­cic scored 18 of his game-high 24 points in the first half. Josh Richard­son added 21 points and Tim Har­d­away Jr chipped in with 18 for the Mavs, who got off the mark after open­ing the sea­son with two de­feats.</p>
    <p>They broke a record held by the</p>
    <p>Golden State War­riors, who led the Sacra­mento Kings by 47 points after two quar­ters in 1991.</p>
    <p>The Clip­pers fell to their first de­feat of the cam­paign after two vic­to­ries over Western Con­fer­ence ri­vals, with Ge­orge, who had 15 points, Serge Ibaka (13) and Ivica Zubac (10) the only play­ers to emerge with any form of credit.</p>
    <p>But de­spite get­ting ut­terly dom­i­nated – Dal­las were 29-for-50 (58 per cent) com­pared to nine­for-37 (24.3 per cent) for Los An­ge­les from the field – Ge­orge claimed it was a one-off.</p>
    <p>“Yes, we got our butts kicked to­day, but it’s one game,” the for­ward said.</p>
    <p>“It was a tough game, com­ing from Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>“I en­joyed my Christ­mas Day yes­ter­day, to­day just popped up on me a lit­tle too fast. I take full re­spon­si­bil­ity. It’ll be a dif­fer­ent sit­u­a­tion next game. We will be ready.”</p>
    <p>Don­cic, who last sea­son led Dal­las to the play-offs for the first time since 2016 and gave the Clip­pers a fright in the first round, in­sisted it was less about how badly the hosts played but rather a true in­di­ca­tion of his team’s po­ten­tial after a shaky start.</p>
    <p>“We showed who we are. Peo­ple judge us like first two games of sea­son, it’s a long sea­son,” the 2019 Rookie of the Year said. “We got to keep go­ing like that. We got to play de­fence.”</p>
    <p>Mav­er­icks coach Rick Carlisle agreed, chal­leng­ing his play­ers to “main­tain that level of com­pet­i­tive­ness”.</p>
    <p>He added: “Our guys es­tab­lished a stan­dard for col­lec­tive tough­ness and will that we need to find a way to main­tain.”</p>
    <p>Over in the East, there was an­other up­set as the New York Knicks, among the worst teams in the league for the past few sea­sons, stunned the Mil­wau­kee Bucks, the top seeds for the last two years, 130-110 at Madi­son Square Gar­den.</p>
    <p>The Knicks’ win snapped a fiveg­ame los­ing streak against the Bucks, who swept all three games last sea­son by a com­bined 91 points.</p>
    <p>Julius Ran­dle had a game-high 29 points for New York, who won for the first time un­der new coach Tom Thi­bodeau, while two-time MVP Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo paced Mil­wau­kee with 27 points.</p>
    <p>NBA cham­pi­ons Los An­ge­les Lak­ers, how­ever, bucked the trend of shocks, rout­ing the Min­nesota Tim­ber­wolves 127-91 de­spite miss­ing lead­ing scorer An­thony Davis be­cause of in­jury.</p>
    <p>Last sea­son’s Fi­nals MVP Le­Bron James played only three quar­ters but his 18 points along­side a teamhigh 20 from Kyle Kuzma ended the vis­i­tors’ two-game win­ning start.</p>
