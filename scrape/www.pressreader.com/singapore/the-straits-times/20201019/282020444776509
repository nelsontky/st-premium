    <p>Sin­ga­pore stu­dents con­tin­ued to do well in in­ter­na­tional com­pe­ti­tions de­spite the damper that the Covid-19 pan­demic has put on such meets.</p>
    <p>The com­pe­ti­tions had been mod­i­fied to al­low coun­tries to par­tic­i­pate vir­tu­ally, the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion said last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>For one, the In­ter­na­tional Bi­ol­ogy Olympiad this year was can­celled and re­placed with a spe­cial chal­lenge edi­tion that was con­ducted re­motely.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore team gar­nered one gold medal and three sil­ver medals at the chal­lenge, which was held from Aug 11 to 12. Stu­dents had to per­form a di­verse range of com­plex tasks, such as re­con­sti­tut­ing and draw­ing the shape of a struc­ture based on pho­to­graphs.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore ranked fifth in a field of 47 coun­tries/ter­ri­to­ries with 186 par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>At the 52nd In­ter­na­tional Chem­istry Olympiad on July 25, Sin­ga­pore se­cured three gold medals and one sil­ver medal. Stu­dents un­der­took the­o­ret­i­cal tasks, in­clud­ing to­tal syn­the­sis of an or­ganic com­pound iso­lated from the cat­nip plant. Sin­ga­pore was placed joint third among 60 coun­tries/ter­ri­to­ries with 231 par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>More re­cently, at the 61st In­ter­na­tional Math­e­mat­i­cal Olympiad from Sept 19 to 28, the Sin­ga­pore team won four sil­ver medals and two bronze medals. The stu­dents were tasked to solve six chal­leng­ing prob­lems, in­clud­ing one in­spired by the cur­rent so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures im­posed around the world. Sin­ga­pore ranked 16th among 105 coun­tries/ter­ri­to­ries with 616 par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, at the 32nd In­ter­na­tional Olympiad in In­for­mat­ics or­gan­ised by the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore from Sept 13 to 19, the Sin­ga­pore team clinched three sil­ver medals and one bronze medal.</p>
    <p>As host, Sin­ga­pore also fielded a sec­ond team, which clinched an­other sil­ver medal and two more bronze medals. Dur­ing the com­pe­ti­tion, stu­dents tack­led com­pu­ta­tional prob­lems that tested their abil­ity to de­sign and im­ple­ment ef­fi­cient al­go­rithms and data struc­tures. Based on the first team’s re­sults, the Repub­lic placed joint 19th among 87 coun­tries/ter­ri­to­ries and 343 par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>The 33rd In­ter­na­tional Young Physi­cists’ Tour­na­ment was can­celled due to the pan­demic. How­ever, the Sin­ga­pore team was in­vited to par­tic­i­pate in an­other com­pe­ti­tion, the New Zealand Young Physi­cists’ Tour­na­ment, from July 10 to 12, where it emerged as first.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the meet, stu­dents pre­sented their re­search on prob­lems re­lated to ev­ery­day phe­nom­e­non.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong praised the win­ners in a Face­book post last week, adding: “I hope these achieve­ments will in­spire all our stu­dents to pur­sue their pas­sions and strive for ex­cel­lence in learn­ing about what they love.”</p>
