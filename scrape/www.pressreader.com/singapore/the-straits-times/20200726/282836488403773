    <p>Even economies that were ini­tially hailed for their han­dling of the coro­n­avirus sit­u­a­tion have wit­nessed a surge in cases.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore, for ex­am­ple, saw a spurt in cases among its for­eign worker pop­u­la­tion in April but com­mu­nity cases are now viewed as be­ing low enough to per­mit a par­tial re­turn to nor­malcy.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong, which also en­joyed ini­tial suc­cess against the virus, is sud­denly see­ing a spurt in cases. It has had more than 1,000 cases since early July, ac­count­ing for over 40 per cent of its to­tal cases since the virus first hit the Chi­nese ter­ri­tory in late Jan­uary.The de­vel­op­ment has alarmed health of­fi­cials, who face a short­age of iso­la­tion beds and test­ing ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia, too, has wit­nessed an un­abated rise in cases, which led it to sur­pass China – the epi­cen­tre of the orig­i­nal out­break – in terms of the to­tal num­ber of in­fec­tions. In­done­sia had 97,286 cases, against 83,784 in China, as of 5pm yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In Ja­pan, the na­tion­wide death toll is near­ing 1,000, with cases emerg­ing on a daily ba­sis, many of them in the cap­i­tal Tokyo. The num­ber of con­firmed cases in Ja­pan rose by a record 1,000 on Fri­day to touch 27,956.</p>
    <p>In Aus­tralia, of­fi­cials have en­forced a six-week par­tial lock­down and made face masks manda­tory for res­i­dents in Mel­bourne, the cap­i­tal of Vic­to­ria state, af­ter a fresh out­break that saw a record num­ber of new cases de­tected in a sin­gle day last week.</p>
    <p>In the West, Barcelona in Spain has in­structed mil­lions of peo­ple to stay at home fol­low­ing a spike in in­fec­tions. Spain recorded 922 new cases last Fri­day, prompt­ing of­fi­cials to is­sue warn­ings against go­ing out.</p>
    <p>\The toll in Mex­ico is also spi­ralling up, with its Health Min­istry re­port­ing 7,573 new cases and 737 fa­tal­i­ties on Fri­day, tak­ing the coun­try-wide to­tal to 378,285 cases and 42,645 deaths.</p>
