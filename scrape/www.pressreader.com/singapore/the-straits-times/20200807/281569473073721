    <p>A bright red la­bel on the pack­ag­ing will help shop­pers iden­tify lo­cal pro­duce from this month. The “SG Fresh Pro­duce” logo was cre­ated in con­sul­ta­tion with more than 30 lo­cal farm­ers, re­tail­ers and in­dus­try as­so­ci­a­tions. It will be pro­gres­sively rolled out to home-grown pro­duce in su­per­mar­kets and re­tail­ers here.</p>
    <p>A bright red la­bel on the pack­ag­ing will help shop­pers iden­tify lo­cal pro­duce with greater ease from this month on­ward.</p>
    <p>The “SG Fresh Pro­duce” logo was cre­ated in con­sul­ta­tion with more than 30 lo­cal farm­ers, re­tail­ers and in­dus­try as­so­ci­a­tions. It will be pro­gres­sively rolled out to home-grown pro­duce in su­per­mar­kets and re­tail­ers here, the Sin­ga­pore Food Agency (SFA) said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>It added that this in­cludes pro­duce sold through on­line re­tail­ers such as RedMart.</p>
    <p>The la­bel won al­most 70 per cent of the votes in an on­line ex­er­cise. Over 2,200 peo­ple had been in­vited to pick their favourite logo de­signs.</p>
    <p>It was first un­veiled at the launch of the Sin­ga­pore Food Story in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>The then Min­is­ter for the En­vi­ron­ment and Wa­ter Re­sources Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli had urged con­sumers to look out for the la­bel and sup­port lo­cal pro­duce when they shop.</p>
    <p>The push to sup­port lo­cal pro­duce comes as the Repub­lic ramps up lo­cal food pro­duc­tion in or­der to hit its “30 by 30” goal – to grow enough food lo­cally to meet 30 per cent of its nu­tri­tional needs by 2030.</p>
    <p>Dr Choo Li Nah, se­nior direc­tor of SFA’s com­mu­ni­ca­tions and ser­vice qual­ity di­vi­sion, said: “Be­yond the Gov­ern­ment’s sup­port for lo­cal farm­ers to ramp up pro­duc­tion, de­mand from con­sumers is equally im­por­tant to sus­tain a healthy and vi­brant agri-food ecosys­tem.</p>
    <p>“By choos­ing lo­cal pro­duce, con­sumers can help sup­port our lo­cal farm­ers and spur farm­ers to em­brace tech­nol­ogy and be­come more pro­duc­tive to meet in­creased de­mand.”</p>
    <p>Grow­ing lo­cal is a key strat­egy in SFA’s three-pronged ap­proach to­wards mak­ing Sin­ga­pore a food se­cure na­tion, along­side di­ver­si­fy­ing food im­port sources to guard against global sup­ply chain shocks and help­ing lo­cal busi­nesses ex­pand their op­er­a­tions over­seas and ex­port food pro­duce back home.</p>
    <p>Last year, lo­cal farms pro­duced 14 per cent of leafy veg­eta­bles, 26 per cent of eggs and 10 per cent of fish con­sumed here. Fish, leafy veg­eta­bles and eggs are the three most com­monly con­sumed food items in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>SFA had ear­lier said it will con­tinue to work with su­per­mar­ket chains, such as FairPrice, Cold Stor­age and Prime Su­per­mar­ket, to en­cour­age peo­ple to buy lo­cal pro­duce.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes or­gan­is­ing joint pro­mo­tions and dis­play­ing in-store brand­ing col­lat­er­als with key mes­sages to pro­mote lo­cal pro­duce.</p>
    <p>Madam Es­ther Chia, 68, told The Straits Times in Man­darin: “With the red la­bel, it will def­i­nitely make lo­cal pro­duce more prom­i­nent and eas­ier to find.”</p>
    <p>The home­maker said that she al­ways pur­chases lo­cally pro­duced eggs as she feels that they “are fresher and taste bet­ter”.</p>
    <p>“The pandemic made us re­alise we can’t al­ways de­pend on food im­ports. That’s why I al­ways sup­port home-grown pro­duce,” she said.</p>
