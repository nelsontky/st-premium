    <p>Ris­ing star Tyler Herro lived up to his name on Wed­nes­day, com­ing off the bench to score a ca­reer-high 37 points as the Mi­ami Heat seized com­mand of their Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) Eastern Con­fer­ence Fi­nals se­ries with a 112-109 win.</p>
    <p>The 20-year-old rookie made five of 10 threes as Mi­ami took a 3-1 lead over the Bos­ton Celtics in the best-of-seven se­ries in the NBA’s quar­an­tine bub­ble in Or­lando, Florida.</p>
    <p>His points to­tal is the sec­ond most in a play-off game for a player 20 or younger, be­hind only Magic John­son who had 42.</p>
    <p>“I’m just go­ing to bet on my­self,” the No. 13 pick in last June’s draft told ESPN.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been do­ing that my whole life. I went from a small town in Mil­wau­kee to Ken­tucky, and nobody thought I would sur­vive there, and nobody thought I would sur­vive here. At the end of the day, it’s just bet­ting on my­self.”</p>
    <p>Herro upped the ante af­ter post­ing a post-sea­son-high 22 points in Game 3. His team­mates are com­fort­able bank­ing on him too. Af­ter all, the swing­man is av­er­ag­ing 36 min­utes per game against Bos­ton, mak­ing 48 per cent of his shots and 34 per cent of shots from be­hind the arc.</p>
    <p>“Not too many peo­ple get an op­por­tu­nity to make it this far in the play-offs and be in a game like this, but for him, it’s an­other day in the of­fice,” Jimmy But­ler, who added 24 points, said of Herro.</p>
    <p>Mi­ami coach Erik Spoel­stra agreed that Herro’s suc­cess has sur­prised no one at the Heat.</p>
    <p>“He is a worker, and he shows up the next day try­ing to get better ev­ery sin­gle day,” he said. “And he earns the trust – I think it’s more im­por­tant earn­ing the trust of his team­mates than the coach­ing staff, but it’s that daily grind when nobody is watch­ing and do­ing it when most peo­ple don’t.”</p>
    <p>The win moved the Heat to within one vic­tory of an NBA Fi­nals berth, which they will try to se­cure in Game 5 today.</p>
    <p>Go­ran Dragic had 22 points, and Bam Ade­bayo added 20 points and 12 re­bounds for Mi­ami, who re­bounded from just their sec­ond loss of the post-sea­son in Game 3.</p>
    <p>Jayson Ta­tum scored a teamhigh 28 points, all com­ing in the sec­ond half, and he knows he can­not af­ford an­other flat start.</p>
    <p>“I wish we would have played like that from the start. I take a lot of blame, you know, I didn’t play like my­self in the first half,” said the Celtics for­ward.</p>
    <p>Jaylen Brown had 21 points for Bos­ton, who were look­ing to win con­sec­u­tive play-off games for the first time since the start of their sec­ond-round se­ries against then ti­tle-hold­ers Toronto Rap­tors.</p>
    <p>Kemba Walker scored 20, Gordon Hay­ward 14 and Mar­cus Smart had 10 points, but the Celtics turned the ball over 19 times in the game. “We’ve got to do a better job of han­dling the ball and tak­ing care of it,” said coach Brad Stevens.</p>
