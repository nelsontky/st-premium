    <p>What is your se­cret to look­ing fab­u­lous?</p>
    <p>There’s no se­cret. A lot of us know it, but ap­ply­ing knowl­edge to ac­tion has al­ways been the big­gest chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>Aes­thet­ics is a by-prod­uct of be­ing healthy, by be­ing con­sis­tent with your phys­i­cal ac­tiv­i­ties, diet and sleep. Many peo­ple tend to ne­glect get­ting enough hours of sleep, but it is so vi­tal as most of our bod­ies’ re­cov­ery and re­pair is done dur­ing this time.</p>
    <p>I try to clock in at least 40 minutes of phys­i­cal ac­tiv­ity and eight hours of sleep every day.</p>
    <p>Has there ever been a time when you were not fit and fab?</p>
    <p>Ab­so­lutely. I was ex­ces­sively drink­ing for years, smok­ing and eat­ing what­ever I wanted. It was ev­i­dent I did not care for my health. I was lethar­gic, un­fit and over­weight, and con­vinced my­self I was “do­ing enough” by play­ing recre­ational sports over the week­end to negate the life­style I led.</p>
    <p>About five years ago, I started fac­ing health is­sues such as chronic gas­tri­tis. That was a wake-up call and I de­cided to take charge of my life then.</p>
    <p>What is your diet like?</p>
    <p>While I did put my­self through some short-term chal­lenges and strict di­ets in the past, I now try to main­tain a high pro­tein and mod­er­ate car­bo­hy­drate diet that also in­cludes avoid­ing pro­cessed food and be­ing ad­e­quately hy­drated through­out the day.</p>
    <p>I don’t re­ally re­strict my­self from eat­ing some­thing, but I try to limit my al­co­hol con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>What are your in­dul­gences?</p>
    <p>I love my “lemak” food like nasi padang, nasi lemak and Per­anakan food.</p>
    <p>How do you main­tain a healthy work-life bal­ance?</p>
    <p>De­cid­ing to work out in the morn­ing be­fore work hours has been the game-changer for me.</p>
    <p>This win­dow of un­in­ter­rupted time be­fore I start my day proper al­lows me to get a big en­dor­phin boost which in­creases my alert­ness and fo­cus dur­ing the day at work.</p>
    <p>I tend to keep the week­ends free for ev­ery­thing else I wish to do.</p>
    <p>What are the three most im­por­tant things in your life?</p>
    <p>God, my fi­ancee and my health.</p>
    <p>What is your favourite and least favourite part of your body?</p>
    <p>I like them all. I’m just grate­ful to God who has blessed me with func­tional limbs, a liv­ing and healthy body that I can progress in and jour­ney to­gether with my mates.</p>
    <p>What are your must-dos be­fore and af­ter a work­out?</p>
    <p>No spe­cific rit­u­als. I do, how­ever, pre­fer work­ing out in a fasted state (ex­er­cis­ing on an empty stom­ach).</p>
    <p>It helps that I gen­er­ally do not eat break­fast, although this is usu­ally a con­tentious topic be­cause it does not work for and is not agreed on by ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>How im­por­tant is it for you to keep up with your fit­ness rou­tine?</p>
    <p>Ex­tremely. Ever since ex­er­cis­ing be­came a habit for me, I do feel quite ir­ri­ta­ble when I skip or miss a work­out – I need the en­dor­phins.</p>
    <p>I work out six times a week and al­lo­cate about 40 minutes to an hour to each work­out.</p>
    <p>How are you keep­ing fit dur­ing this pe­riod?</p>
    <p>Over the past few years, I built up my fit­ness pri­mar­ily on high-in­ten­sity in­ter­val train­ing work­outs, but re­cently fo­cused on cal­is­then­ics.</p>
    <p>Be­cause cal­is­then­ics is so ver­sa­tile, I don’t need any bulky gym equip­ment to put in a good work­out. All I need is my own body weight. It has been per­fect for the work-from-home sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>What are the changes you have made to keep ex­er­cis­ing dur­ing this time?</p>
    <p>I al­ways pre­ferred work­ing out with a com­mu­nity, so not be­ing able to phys­i­cally do that and work­ing out alone was tough.</p>
    <p>Thank­fully, ap­pli­ca­tions like video-con­fer­enc­ing plat­form Zoom have al­lowed me and my friends to work out to­gether vir­tu­ally in our re­spec­tive homes at the same time.</p>
    <p>In­ter­est­ingly, it also helped me to re­con­nect with old friends and build re­la­tion­ships with new ones through th­ese vir­tual work­outs.</p>
    <p>How has your ac­tive life­style in­flu­enced your fam­ily and friends?</p>
    <p>The truth is that many of them in­flu­enced and in­spired me first. I was a stub­born child grow­ing up and only re­cently re­alised the im­por­tance of an ac­tive and healthy life­style.</p>
    <p>I rarely say it, but I guess this is the per­fect chance to do so – what­ever trans­for­ma­tion I have ex­pe­ri­enced was not done on my own. Along the way, my friends and fam­ily have con­trib­uted to the pos­i­tive changes I have made in my life.</p>
    <p>What is the most ex­treme thing you have done in the name of fit­ness?</p>
    <p>Snow­board­ing down a moun­tain dressed in a mank­ini (a sling swim­suit worn by men) in mi­nus 20 deg C in ex­change for a free snow­board bought by my friends.</p>
    <p>It wasn’t a pleas­ant ex­pe­ri­ence, but it was a pleas­ant gift.</p>
    <p>How ex­ten­sive is your col­lec­tion of sports-re­lated para­pher­na­lia?</p>
    <p>Liver­pool jer­seys from every sea­son since 2007 and tro­phies from my rugby play­ing days.</p>
    <p>Would you go for plas­tic surgery?</p>
    <p>I would pre­fer to save the sur­geon from ex­ten­sive work.</p>
    <p>Do you think you’re sexy?</p>
    <p>Some days.</p>
