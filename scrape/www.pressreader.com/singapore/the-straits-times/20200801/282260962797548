    <p>• China’s fac­to­ries stepped up ac­tiv­ity in July for the fifth straight month as im­prov­ing prospects for elec­tri­cal and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal goods helped sus­tain a broader re­cov­ery from ear­lier coro­n­avirus shut­downs.</p>
    <p>The world’s sec­ond-largest econ­omy has largely shaken off the strict lock­downs that led to weeks of busi­ness paral­y­sis ear­lier this year, al­though it is now bat­tling a resur­gence of the coro­n­avirus, driven by in­fec­tions in the coun­try’s west and north-east.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment’s man­u­fac­tur­ing Pur­chas­ing Man­agers’ In­dex (PMI), re­leased yes­ter­day by the Na­tional Bureau of Statis­tics, un­ex­pect­edly rose to 51.1 in July from June’s 50.9. That was the high­est read­ing since March and beat an­a­lyst expectatio­ns for a fall to 50.7. The 50-point mark separates growth from con­trac­tion.</p>
    <p>The PMI echoed up­beat read­ings from other ma­jor Asian ex­port na­tions, with fac­tory pro­duc­tion in South Korea jump­ing at the fastest rate in more than 11 years, and Ja­pan’s out­put snap­ping four months of de­cline.</p>
    <p>How­ever, an­a­lysts cau­tion that the re­cov­ery could stall amid ris­ing global in­fec­tions and as China’s fac­to­ries deal with flood dis­rup­tions.</p>
    <p>“The cur­rent rapid pace of re­cov­ery is likely to slow in the com­ing months as the ini­tial boost from re­open­ing busi­nesses fades,” said Cap­i­tal Eco­nom­ics an­a­lyst Ju­lian Evans-Pritchard. “The prop to ex­ports from ship­ments of goods linked to the pan­demic (like masks and work-from-home equip­ment) is also likely to di­min­ish.”</p>
    <p>Re­in­forc­ing the down­beat out­look for global de­mand, in­dus­try re­search re­leased yes­ter­day showed world­wide smart­phone sales down 14 per cent year on year in the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>China’s PMI sur­vey showed new ex­port or­ders fell, in­di­cat­ing con­tin­ued pres­sure on ex­ter­nal de­mand, while firms con­tin­ued to shed more work­ers than they hired. But the pace of de­clines slowed from the pre­vi­ous month, sug­gest­ing a bot­tom­ing out in these trends, while pro­duc­tion and to­tal new or­ders both hit four-month highs.</p>
    <p>Small com­pa­nies con­tinue to feel both sup­ply and de­mand pres­sure, with a sub-in­dex for them fall­ing fur­ther into con­trac­tion.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan also showed signs of mod­est re­cov­ery in broader busi­ness and con­sumer ac­tiv­ity as in­dus­trial out­put snapped four months of de­cline in June. Of­fi­cial data re­leased yes­ter­day showed fac­tory out­put in the world’s third-largest econ­omy rose 2.7 per cent in June from the pre­vi­ous month when it hit its low­est level since March 2009 dur­ing the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The rise was largely thanks to a bounce in mo­tor ve­hi­cle pro­duc­tion, and beat the me­dian fore­cast for a 1.2 per cent in­crease in a Reuters poll of econ­o­mists. Ja­pan’s eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity has grad­u­ally re­sumed in re­cent months af­ter the gov­ern­ment lifted a state of emer­gency at the end of May.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rate data showed its June job­less rate edged down from a three­year high reached in the pre­vi­ous month, al­though the num­ber of avail­able jobs per ap­pli­cant fell to a more than five-year low.</p>
