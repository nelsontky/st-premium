    <p>Zouk night­club will be trans­form­ing its dance floor into a spin stu­dio by day and cin­ema by night, as it piv­ots to stay afloat with club­bing off the cards for the fore­see­able fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Zouk Group’s chief ex­ec­u­tive An­drew Li told The Sun­day Times that the tie-up with spin stu­dio Ab­so­lute Cy­cle will al­low the club to bet­ter utilise its space, and help its part­ner cater to ex­cess de­mand as safe dis­tanc­ing rules have forced fit­ness stu­dios to re­duce their ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>Zouk can ac­com­mo­date 50 bikes across two floors, Mr Li said, adding that classes will run seven days a week, start­ing to­mor­row. “We have all this space, and the sound sys­tem, light­ing and smoke ma­chines make for the per­fect set­ting.”</p>
    <p>The club is also await­ing fi­nal ap­proval to start screen­ing films, with plans to of­fer themed movie nights four times a week.</p>
    <p>“We can set up spaced-out ta­bles of up to five and dec­o­rate the club to match the theme of the month.</p>
    <p>We’re also work­ing on food pro­gram­ming to com­ple­ment the movie ex­pe­ri­ence,” Mr Li said.</p>
    <p>In July, the Clarke Quay club con­verted Cap­i­tal, a lounge in the 31,000 sq ft Zouk com­plex, into a dine-in eatery. Rent­ing space to Lazada for live stream­ing has also been among the new sources of rev­enue.</p>
    <p>Zouk’s lat­est plans come as the</p>
    <p>op­er­a­tors pivot or exit, which was an­nounced by Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Mr Li said packed dance floors are un­likely to re­turn in the near fu­ture. “We have to keep think­ing out­side the box, be­cause we don’t know how long this will last.”</p>
    <p>He said the new rev­enue streams, combined with wage sub­si­dies, have</p>
    <p>Zouk night­club’s tie-up with Ab­so­lute Cy­cle al­lows the club to bet­ter utilise its space while help­ing the spin stu­dio cater to ex­cess de­mand. al­lowed Zouk to break even and re­tain staff. The trans­for­ma­tion into an all-day des­ti­na­tion is also part of Zouk’s larger shift from nightlife op­er­a­tor to life­style group, Mr Li said.</p>
    <p>“You can spin in the af­ter­noon, watch a movie and have din­ner all in the same place,” he said, adding that plans to part­ner ho­tels on stay­ca­tion pack­ages are in the works.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, other night­clubs like Bang Bang and Lulu’s Lounge re­main in hi­ber­na­tion mode as par­ent SJS Group fo­cuses on its other food and bev­er­age brands, while venues such as Mar­quee are keep­ing the party go­ing with vir­tual events.</p>
    <p>Some op­er­a­tors say there are hur­dles in piv­ot­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Volkan G., manag­ing di­rec­tor of F Club x At­tica, said the na­ture and lay­out of the unit make chang­ing its use dif­fi­cult. “Piv­ot­ing might not be eco­nom­i­cal, look­ing at the in­vest­ment needed; it might also be dif­fi­cult to keep the club li­cence af­ter­wards.”</p>
    <p>Ms Francesca Way, co-founder of en­ter­tain­ment and nightlife com­pany A Phat Cat Col­lec­tive, said plans to re­open its ar­cade-themed bar and night­club Nine­teen80 as a din­ing con­cept have been de­layed.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause its ap­pli­ca­tion to tem­po­rar­ily change the unit’s use re­mains un­der as­sess­ment by the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity, pend­ing the Govern­ment’s re­view of its ap­proach to night­clubs.</p>
    <p>While Zouk has been able to pivot, it has been ex­tremely dif­fi­cult for other night­clubs to do so with­out a pre-ex­ist­ing kitchen and help from land­lords and the au­thor­i­ties, given the com­plex­ity of the process, Ms Way said.</p>
    <p>Mr Joseph Ong, manag­ing di­rec­tor of 1-Group, said he is wait­ing for ap­proval to trans­form Yang club at Clarke Quay into a din­ner and en­ter­tain­ment con­cept.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong, who is pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore Nightlife Busi­ness As­so­ci­a­tion, said the in­dus­try has been en­gag­ing the au­thor­i­ties on the av­enues of sup­port for the busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>To help its mem­bers pivot, the as­so­ci­a­tion is work­ing with En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore to sim­plify the process of ap­ply­ing for the En­ter­prise De­vel­op­ment Grant, which will help fund up to 80 per cent of el­i­gi­ble costs.</p>
    <p>It has also pro­posed ex­tend­ing al­co­hol-sale hours at li­censed es­tab­lish­ments be­yond 10.30pm and al­low­ing karaoke joints to re­open with safe man­age­ment mea­sures in place.</p>
    <p>Asked about these pro­pos­als and if nightlife will be al­lowed to re­open in phase three, the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try said it is tak­ing a cau­tious ap­proach to en­ter­tain­ment es­tab­lish­ments in the sec­tor, given the higher risk of Covid-19 trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment is closely en­gag­ing the in­dus­try to work out pos­si­ble so­lu­tions to move for­ward, a spokesman said.</p>
    <p>“Nightlife busi­nesses have sub­mit­ted pro­pos­als which we are re­view­ing care­fully, and we are also ex­plor­ing ways to sup­port them, such as switch­ing to ac­tiv­i­ties that are per­mit­ted.”</p>
    <p>We have all this space, and the sound sys­tem, light­ing and smoke ma­chines make for the per­fect set­ting... We have to keep think­ing out­side the box, be­cause we don’t know how long this will last.</p>
