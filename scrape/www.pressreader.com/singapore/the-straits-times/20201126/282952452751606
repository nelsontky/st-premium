    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Bey­once dom­i­nated nom­i­na­tions on Tues­day for next year’s Grammy Awards in a field that favoured al­ter­na­tive artists over main­stream mu­si­cians, topped by a stun­ning snub for Cana­dian singer The Weeknd, who called the process “cor­rupt”.</p>
    <p>Bey­once’s nine nods made her the sec­ond most-nom­i­nated Grammy artist in his­tory, with 79, and came through projects that cel­e­brated black cul­ture in a year of racial tur­moil in the United States.</p>
    <p>Record pro­ducer Quincy Jones and rap­per Jay-Z have 80 apiece.</p>
    <p>The big­gest shut-out for the high­est hon­ours in the mu­sic in­dus­try was The Weeknd, whose crit­i­cally ac­claimed al­bum Af­ter Hours, was No. 1 on the Bill­board 200 charts for four weeks.</p>
    <p>Va­ri­ety called the omis­sion of the R&B singer, who has been cho­sen to play the half-time show at the Su­per Bowl next year, “the big­gest snub in mem­ory”.</p>
    <p>The Weeknd, in a Twit­ter post, said: “The Gram­mys re­main cor­rupt. You owe me, my fans and the in­dus­try trans­parency.”</p>
    <p>The Record­ing Academy’s chair and in­terim chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer, Mr Har­vey Ma­son, said in a writ­ten state­ment that he un­der­stood The Weeknd’s dis­ap­point­ment.</p>
    <p>“We were thrilled when we found out he would be per­form­ing at the upcoming Su­per Bowl and we would have loved to have him also per­form on the Grammy stage the week­end be­fore. Un­for­tu­nately, ev­ery year, there are fewer nom­i­na­tions than the num­ber of de­serv­ing artists,” Mr Ma­son said.</p>
    <p>In June, the academy, whose mem­bers choose the nom­i­nees and vote on the win­ners, an­nounced tighter rules re­gard­ing po­ten­tial con­flicts of in­ter­est in re­sponse to claims that the se­lec­tion process was open to rig­ging.</p>
    <p>The Gram­mys will be handed out in Los An­ge­les on Jan 31, hosted by co­me­dian-ac­tor Trevor Noah.</p>
    <p>In a his­tory-mak­ing turn, South Korea’s K-pop megas­tars BTS were nom­i­nated for the Grammy Award in best pop duo/group per­for­mance, be­com­ing the first South Korean act to be up for the Amer­i­can mu­sic award.</p>
    <p>The pow­er­house septet, one of the world’s most suc­cess­ful boy bands since its de­but in 2013, was nom­i­nated for its hit sin­gle Dy­na­mite.</p>
    <p>BTS were one of five nom­i­nated in the cat­e­gory, which in­cluded In­ten­tions by Justin Bieber, fea­tur­ing Quavo; Rain On Me by Lady Gaga and Ari­ana Grande; and Tay­lor Swift’s Ex­ile, fea­tur­ing Bon Iver.</p>
    <p>But that was the boy band’s only nom­i­na­tion – Dy­na­mite was shut out of Record of the Year and Song of the Year de­spite be­ing con­sid­ered a strong con­tender.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish singer Dua Lipa, pop star Tay­lor Swift and rap­per Roddy Ricch got six nom­i­na­tions apiece.</p>
    <p>Swift and Lipa will com­pete for the top prize – Al­bum of the Year – along with R&B singer Post Malone, Bri­tish band Cold­play, fe­male band Haim, avant-garde Bri­ton Ja­cob Col­lier, Amer­i­can soul band Black Pu­mas and Amer­i­can al­ter­na­tive R&B singer Jhene Aiko.</p>
    <p>Bill­board called the nom­i­na­tions for Al­bum of the Year, Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best New Artist sur­pris­ing for the range of “su­per­star nom­i­nees as well as out-of-nowhere new­com­ers”.</p>
    <p>Bob Dy­lan, 79, was a no-show de­spite ac­claim for his first al­bum of new mu­sic in eight years, Rough And Rowdy Ways, while es­tab­lished artists such as Katy Perry, Maren Morris, The Chicks, Halsey and the Jonas Broth­ers were not nom­i­nated.</p>
    <p>The Best New Artist field in­cluded rap­pers Me­gan Thee Stal­lion and Doja Cat, as well as al­ter­na­tive artist Phoebe Bridgers and Noah Cyrus, younger sis­ter of Mi­ley Cyrus.</p>
    <p>Women, in­clud­ing Fiona Ap­ple, Brit­tany Howard and new­comer In­grid An­dress, packed the rock and coun­try mu­sic fields, while Britain’s Harry Styles got his first taste of Grammy love with three nods for his work on the al­bum Fine Line.</p>
    <p>South Korean girl group Blackpink – which in re­cent years col­lab­o­rated on bangers with Cardi B, Lady Gaga and Lipa – were sur­pris­ingly left out of the Best New Artist race.</p>
    <p>The spo­ken word cat­e­gory that reg­u­larly fea­tures un­ex­pected Grammy con­tenders – for­mer US first lady and pres­i­dent Michelle and Barack Obama are past win­ners – this year in­cludes jour­nal­ists Rachel Mad­dow and Ro­nan Far­row.</p>
    <p>Red Hot Chili Pep­pers’ bassist</p>
    <p>Flea is also nom­i­nated for his mem­oir, as is ac­tress Meryl Streep for her read­ing of the chil­dren’s book Char­lotte’s Web, and Ken Jen­nings, star of Jeopardy, for read­ing the mem­oir writ­ten by the beloved game show’s late host Alex Tre­bek.</p>
    <p>Euro­vi­sion got an un­likely shoutout this time around, as the sound­track for a com­edy film about the kitschy con­test was nom­i­nated for Best Com­pi­la­tion Sound­track For Vis­ual Me­dia.</p>
