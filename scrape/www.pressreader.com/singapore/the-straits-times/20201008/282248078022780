    <p>TOKYO • The Tokyo Stock Ex­change (TSE) has ap­pointed four ex­ter­nal board mem­bers to a com­mit­tee to in­ves­ti­gate last week’s trad­ing out­age as its sys­tem de­vel­oper, Fu­jitsu, con­tin­ues to ex­am­ine the cause of the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>A hard­ware glitch paral­ysed trad­ing in the world’s third-largest eq­uity mar­ket last Thurs­day, test­ing the ex­change’s cred­i­bil­ity just as the coun­try’s new prime min­is­ter pri­ori­tises dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The ex­change said on Mon­day that the board mem­bers, in­clud­ing well-known lawyer Hideaki Ku­bori, would work to iden­tify the cause of its worst sys­tem out­age and ex­plore mea­sures to pre­vent such incidents in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>The ex­change, owned by Ja­pan Ex­change Group, said the sys­tem crash hap­pened af­ter a mem­ory in one of its discs was phys­i­cally bro­ken and an au­to­matic switch to a back-up sys­tem failed due to a fault in the set­tings.</p>
    <p>“We are look­ing into why it was set up this way,” di­rec­tor of trad­ing sys­tems at the ex­change Ya­suhiko Ta­mura told re­porters.</p>
    <p>The ex­change has sub­se­quently changed the set­tings in ques­tion and con­firmed that the au­to­matic switch-over now works, it said.</p>
    <p>Mr Takahito Tokita, the chief ex­ec­u­tive of Fu­jitsu – the de­vel­oper of the TSE’s Ar­row­head trad­ing sys­tem – said the firm was still in­ves­ti­gat­ing the cause of the out­age, which led to the first full-day sus­pen­sion since the ex­change switched to all-elec­tronic trad­ing in 1999.</p>
    <p>“We will make ut­most ef­forts to find the causes and pre­vent re­cur­rences of such trou­bles,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ar­row­head de­buted in 2010, bring­ing pro­cess­ing times for trades to five mil­lisec­onds.</p>
    <p>The sys­tem was over­hauled in Novem­ber, and cur­rently pro­cesses or­ders in about 0.2 mil­lisec­onds.</p>
    <p>Asked who was re­spon­si­ble for the sys­tem fail­ure, Mr Tokita said it was too early to say be­cause the in­ves­ti­ga­tion was still on­go­ing. He de­clined to com­ment fur­ther.</p>
    <p>The TSE has said it has no plans at this point to ask Fu­jitsu for com­pen­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Tokita said Fu­jitsu had made no de­ci­sion on the is­sue.</p>
    <p>Mr Ei­ichiro Yana­gawa, a Toky­obased senior an­a­lyst at fi­nan­cial ser­vices tech con­sult­ing firm Ce­lent, said: “From what we learnt through the press con­fer­ence, Ar­row­head doesn’t need a ma­jor up­date right now ex­cept for the elim­i­na­tion of the sin­gle point of fail­ure.”</p>
    <p>He added: “The chal­lenge is how to re­duce down­time.”</p>
