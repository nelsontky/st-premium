    <p>• The Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) said on Wed­nes­day that 48 players have tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, a dra­matic in­crease over the zero pos­i­tive tests re­ported dur­ing last season’s “bub­ble” in Or­lando, Florida.</p>
    <p>The league added the pos­i­tive tests were the re­sult of 546 tests car­ried out be­tween Nov 24 and Nov 30 as pre-season games tip off next week ahead of the new term.</p>
    <p>One team, the Golden State War­riors, have al­ready de­layed the be­gin­ning of their in­di­vid­ual work­outs by a day be­cause of players test­ing pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>This was the ini­tial round of tests for players as they re­turned to their teams ahead of the start of in­di­vid­ual work­outs on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The NBA has con­firmed it will be test­ing all of its players daily through­out the season.</p>
    <p>The in­fec­tion rate of 9 per cent is also higher than the 46 players or 5.3 per cent who tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 as the league geared up to restart the pan­demic-dis­rupted term back in July.</p>
    <p>Un­der the league’s tough new Covid-19 pro­to­cols, a player who tests pos­i­tive has to re­frain from work­outs for at least 10 days, even if asymp­to­matic. If he is show­ing symp­toms, then he can­not re­turn un­til the symp­toms have been gone for 10 days.</p>
    <p>Once back i n camp, players would have to work out on their own, and also pass a car­diac screen­ing be­fore they can par­tic­i­pate in team ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“Any­one who has re­turned a con­firmed pos­i­tive test... is iso­lated un­til they are cleared for leav­ing iso­la­tion un­der the rules es­tab­lished by the NBA and the Players As­so­ci­a­tion in ac­cor­dance with CDC (Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion) guid­ance,” an of­fi­cial state­ment read.</p>
    <p>The reg­u­lar season is sched­uled to be­gin on Dec 22.</p>
