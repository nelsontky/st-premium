    <p>July 2020 will al­most cer­tainly be re­mem­bered as the month the US-China re­la­tion­ship went into a steep nose­dive.</p>
    <p>Un­der Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, the United States’ push­back against China, long tele­graphed by Mr Trump from the early days of his 2016 cam­paign, has only gath­ered mo­men­tum.</p>
    <p>Part of the rea­son for the depth and mo­men­tum is that the US has been try­ing to catch up with the ex­tent of what it per­ceives as the China threat. This meant turn­ing around decades of rosy op­ti­mism dat­ing back to then Pres­i­dent Richard Nixon’s break­through visit to China in Fe­bru­ary 1972, and China’s ac­ces­sion to the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO) in 2001.</p>
    <p>To do this, the US has adopted a “whole of gov­ern­ment” ap­proach, re­view­ing ties with China across the spec­trum.</p>
    <p>One thing it takes is­sue with is a lack of rec­i­proc­ity – China, while tak­ing ad­van­tage of the US’ open mar­ket and open so­ci­ety, does not of­fer the same open­ness to the US or oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Another is ma­lign ac­tiv­ity. At a Fri­day brief­ing for jour­nal­ists, a se­nior US of­fi­cial said, in the con­text of a Chi­nese na­tional who had con­cealed her links with the</p>
    <p>Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army and taken refuge in China’s con­sulate in San Fran­cisco: “We have about 2,000 ac­tive coun­ter­in­tel­li­gence in­ves­ti­ga­tions tied to China and we open a new case about ev­ery 10 hours.”</p>
    <p>Cer­tainly, when Mr Nixon went to China in 1972 and shook hands with Mao Ze­dong and</p>
    <p>Zhou En­lai, it seemed a good idea at the time. It was “the week that changed the world”, he said then.</p>
    <p>But it changed the world in a way the US did not an­tic­i­pate.</p>
    <p>Forty-eight years later, last Thurs­day at the Richard Nixon Pres­i­den­tial Li­brary and Mu­seum in Orange County, Cal­i­for­nia, Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo said in a ma­jor speech: “I grew up and served my time in the army dur­ing the Cold War. And if there is one thing I learnt, com­mu­nists al­most al­ways lie.”</p>
    <p>It was a strong speech that in many ways chan­nelled the lan­guage of the Cold War, cap­ping a se­ries of speeches by top US of­fi­cials in a month that will cer­tainly be seen as mark­ing the death of so-called ping pong diplo­macy and a new era of hard­ball.</p>
    <p>And there are in­her­ent risks, es­pe­cially in heav­ily mil­i­tarised and traf­ficked zones like the South China Sea, where the US navy has stepped up free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion op­er­a­tions which bring it into close prox­im­ity with China’s navy.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo’s re­marks came as Amer­i­can diplo­mats in Chengdu were pack­ing their bags af­ter Bei­jing closed the US con­sulate there in re­tal­i­a­tion for the clo­sure by the US of China’s con­sulate in Hous­ton.</p>
    <p>One ques­tion that arises is the sig­nif­i­cance of do­mes­tic pol­i­tics as a fac­tor for Mr Trump, in the cur­rent full-court as­sault on China from across the US gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The as­sault is not only from the US ad­min­is­tra­tion. Congress has, in rare bi­par­ti­san con­sen­sus, been pass­ing a stream of Bills tar­get­ing Chi­nese of­fi­cials and firms linked to China’s ac­tions in Hong Kong, Xin­jiang and the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>A sec­ond ques­tion is whether and, if so, how, US pol­icy may change if Mr Trump loses the elec­tion and pre­sump­tive Demo­cratic Party nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den is Amer­ica’s next pres­i­dent. The elec­tion is only 100 days away.</p>
    <p>The short an­swer is that the style will be dif­fer­ent, but the sub­stance and di­rec­tion will re­main the same. In the cur­rent en­vi­ron­ment, Mr Bi­den can­not af­ford not to be tough on China.</p>
    <p>But a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion, ac­cord­ing to re­ports cit­ing his ad­vis­ers, will likely en­gage more warmly with al­lies, re­turn­ing to a global, mul­ti­lat­eral ap­proach as op­posed to the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s more ap­par­ently uni­lat­eral Amer­ica First doc­trine.</p>
    <p>It would for in­stance re­turn the US to the Paris Agree­ment on cli­mate change, and likely to the WTO as well.</p>
    <p>Cer­tainly, be­ing tough on China is part of Mr Trump’s re-elec­tion strat­egy as it was in 2016 when he was seek­ing the pres­i­dency, but with an even sharper edge now that he has two in­ter­linked prob­lems – the econ­omy he was count­ing on re­mains in the dol­drums and the coro­n­avirus pan­demic is still ram­pant. That leaves blam­ing China as his strong­est card.</p>
    <p>“Trump is con­trast­ing a tough-as-nails ap­proach to China with Bi­den’s squishy and less-de­fined pol­icy,” said</p>
    <p>Dr Pa­trick Cronin, Asia-Pa­cific Se­cu­rity Chair at the Hud­son In­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>“Many Bi­den ad­vis­ers and Democrats in Congress can agree with the ma­jor­ity of the ad­min­is­tra­tion’s re­sponses to Bei­jing’s to­tal com­pe­ti­tion, but they can never ap­pear more hard line,” Dr Cronin told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>“The mi­nor dif­fer­ences be­tween the two par­ties don’t mat­ter,” he said. “What mat­ters is the per­cep­tion that Trump alone is will­ing to give mem­bers of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party some of their own medicine, where oth­ers who know the re­gion pre­fer a higher de­gree of diplo­macy and en­gage­ment.</p>
    <p>“Softly, softly may work for South-east Asian states, but loudly, loudly is what Trump hopes will win re-elec­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Yun Sun, se­nior fel­low and di­rec­tor of the China pro­gramme at the Stim­son Cen­tre in Wash­ing­ton, told ST: “There is a bi­par­ti­san con­sen­sus on China be­ing a threat.</p>
    <p>“In that sense, I think the style and rad­i­cal­ness of Bi­den’s pol­icy will be dif­fer­ent, but the cen­tral theme that China is a prob­lem will re­main.”</p>
    <p>Dr James Carafano, vice-pres­i­dent of the Davis In­sti­tute for Na­tional Se­cu­rity and For­eign Pol­icy at the con­ser­va­tive Her­itage Foun­da­tion, said: “Both (po­lit­i­cal par­ties) re­ally share the goal of tam­ing Chi­nese ma­li­cious and desta­bil­is­ing ac­tiv­ity by push­ing back. The goal is to ei­ther mit­i­gate the threat or press China till it backs off.</p>
    <p>“Both in­creas­ingly look to a broader coali­tion of na­tions from the ‘free world’ to work with. Re­gard­less of elec­tions in Asia, we are go­ing to be work­ing with In­dia, Aus­tralia and Ja­pan.”</p>
    <p>The “five eyes” – an in­tel­li­gence al­liance com­pris­ing Aus­tralia, Canada, New Zealand, the United King­dom and the United States – will be in­creas­ingly im­por­tant, Dr Carafano added.</p>
    <p>The flurry of speeches and mea­sures tar­get­ing China re­flects the cur­rent mood in Wash­ing­ton, said Dr Robert Man­ning, res­i­dent se­nior fel­low at the At­lantic Coun­cil’s Scowcroft Cen­tre for Strat­egy and Se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>“It’s al­most a cru­sade at this point,” he said. “It’s more of an at­ti­tude than a con­sid­ered pol­icy.”</p>
    <p>He added: “The po­lit­i­cal cam­paign is kind of baked into this... Bi­den ob­vi­ously has to play tough for the cam­paign. But I think if Bi­den wins… un­less we have rea­son to be­lieve the CCP (Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party) is go­ing to go away, how­ever bad we think China is, we have to deal with them, we have to build some frame­work for com­pet­i­tive co­ex­is­tence, and I think that’s what the next ad­min­is­tra­tion will do.”</p>
    <p>And Dr Cronin said: “If he wins, Trump will be in a stronger po­si­tion to strike a new bar­gain with China. Even if he loses, Trump can say his legacy was to force a course cor­rec­tion on Amer­ica’s China pol­icy.”</p>
