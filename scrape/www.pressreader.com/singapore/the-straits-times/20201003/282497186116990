    <p>•</p>
    <p>Chelsea’s spend­ing spree of around £220 mil­lion (S$391 mil­lion) in the cur­rent trans­fer win­dow was sup­posed to help Frank Lam­pard’s men close the gap to Premier League cham­pi­ons Liver­pool af­ter they fin­ished 33 points adrift last sea­son.</p>
    <p>The Blues, how­ever, have had a less than ideal start to the cam­paign with one win, one draw and one de­feat. They beat Brighton 3-1, lost 2-0 to Liver­pool, be­fore com­ing back from 3-0 down to draw 3-3 with West Brom last week­end.</p>
    <p>But Chelsea boss Lam­pard is not dis­cour­aged, in­sist­ing his team will “at­tack” ev­ery game as they come.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at his pre-match press con­fer­ence ahead of to­day’s home clash with Crys­tal Palace, he said: “It’s (the league game) im­por­tant, but as im­por­tant as ev­ery game is.</p>
    <p>“Brighton was tough, we have lost to the cham­pi­ons and then clear mis­takes at West Brom.</p>
    <p>“There is clear per­spec­tive of the first three games and we are get­ting more set­tled. We will at­tack the game with con­fi­dence and a de­sire to win, like with ev­ery game.”</p>
    <p>In the early stages of in­te­grat­ing new sign­ings Timo Werner, Kai Havertz, Thi­ago Silva, Ben Chilwell and Edouard Mendy, Chelsea laboured to vic­tory at Brighton be­fore be­ing out­classed by Liver­pool.</p>
    <p>Fight­ing back from three goals down to draw at West Brom was en­cour­ag­ing for their team spirit but a wor­ry­ing sign of their de­fen­sive weak­ness.</p>
    <p>Lam­pard, how­ever, also said that an im­prove­ment of his back­line will re­quire time and pa­tience.</p>
    <p>He said: “Most coaches will tell you that you need to find a pretty set­tled back two, you strive for it but it’s hard. Last year, we had to change a lot, this year will likely be the same.”</p>
    <p>The 42-year-old also con­firmed</p>
    <p>Chris­tian Pulisic would be in the squad for Palace but would not start fol­low­ing his ham­string in­jury.</p>
    <p>Hakim Ziyech, an­other new sign­ing this term, is close to full fit­ness but “not close enough to be on the bench” and make his Blues de­but.</p>
    <p>Lam­pard be­lieves both for­wards will have a big part to play as the sea­son pro­gresses, say­ing: “They will all bring the best out of each other. It’s a shame we haven’t had them.</p>
    <p>“Hakim will bring some­thing com­pletely dif­fer­ent for us. I am very ex­cited to have them fit. I have a clear idea of where I want them to play.”</p>
    <p>Palace, mean­while, have two wins and one loss and man­ager Roy Hodg­son is pleased with his side’s good start so far.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been pleased with the three per­for­mances against three top teams (Southamp­ton, Manch­ester United, Ever­ton),” he said. “On pa­per, it’s a tough start, but I’m very pleased and six points on the board, and hope­fully, a few more on Satur­day.”</p>
