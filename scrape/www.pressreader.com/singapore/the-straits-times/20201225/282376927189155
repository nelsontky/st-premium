    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • The 76ers have not lost at home in Philadel­phia since Dec 20 last year but much has changed since, in­clud­ing a new coach in Doc Rivers.</p>
    <p>The thing that re­mained the same? Joel Em­biid be­ing dom­i­nant down the stretch.</p>
    <p>The for­ward scored 29 points and grabbed 14 re­bounds to lift Philadel­phia past the Wash­ing­ton Wizards 113-107 in Rivers’ de­but with the 76ers in their Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) sea­son opener on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>He was un­stop­pable i n the fourth quar­ter, get­ting the ball on five con­sec­u­tive pos­ses­sions and wip­ing out a 10-point deficit.</p>
    <p>His lay-up with 1min 9sec left put his team up 105-103, and he ended the game 10 of 17 from the floor.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think any­body can stop me, es­pe­cially with the men­tal­ity I have this year,” Em­biid said on ESPN.</p>
    <p>Shake Mil­ton added 19 points while Ben Sim­mons had 16 points, nine re­bounds and seven as­sists. Sim­mons’ dunk in the fi­nal 30 sec­onds keyed the vic­tory.</p>
    <p>Seth Curry chipped in 13 points. Rus­sell West­brook led the Wizards with 21 points, 15 as­sists and 11 re­bounds for his 147th ca­reer triple-dou­ble. He be­came the first player in fran­chise his­tory to post a triple-dou­ble on his de­but.</p>
    <p>“You know what I loved about the game is, we didn’t play well,” said Rivers. “We had stretches that we played well. You can see in that lit­tle third quar­ter, body lan­guage is strug­gling, but they just find a way to win.”</p>
    <p>The Six­ers missed their first 10 shots of the third quar­ter and trailed 70-58. The Wizards were ag­gres­sive and led 83-73 by the end of the pe­riod.</p>
    <p>But Em­biid hit four free throws early in the fourth quar­ter and the Six­ers quickly cut the lead to 83-80. He stayed hot, mak­ing a 15-foot jumper, and the Six­ers tied the game at 88 apiece.</p>
    <p>Bradley Beal, who had a teamhigh 31 points, made a dif­fi­cult three-pointer with 4:02 left for a 99-95 Wizards lead.</p>
    <p>The Six­ers then came back with a 6-0 run capped by Sim­mons’ layup for a 101-99 ad­van­tage with 2:27 re­main­ing.</p>
    <p>Beal be­lieved that Em­biid was the game changer in the last pe­riod.</p>
    <p>He said: “He’s the fo­cal point. The ball is go­ing to Em­biid on ev­ery sin­gle play. He’s a has­sle down there.”</p>
