    <p>What is the name of this plant (right)? Is it a medic­i­nal herbal plant? If so, what are its uses?</p>
    <p>Arnold Loke</p>
    <p>With sparse mor­pho­log­i­cal de­tails seen in the pic­ture, the plant may be the Christ­mas Tree Plant. Its botan­i­cal name is Kalan­choe lacini­ata.</p>
    <p>The plant grows as a suc­cu­lent that shows some drought tol­er­ance. Its leaves and growth habit make it an at­trac­tive plant to grow. Its leaves have been re­ported to be used in tra­di­tional medicine and valued for their anti-in­flam­ma­tory prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>Do not at­tempt to self-med­i­cate with medic­i­nal plants with­out pro­fes­sional su­per­vi­sion. This genus of plants con­tains toxic car­diac gly­co­sides. Keep the plant out of reach of young chil­dren and pets.</p>
    <p>When seeds do not ger­mi­nate, one of the most com­mon rea­sons could be that they are not fresh and hence not vi­able.</p>
    <p>Seeds have a life­span and most species need to be sown fresh to en­sure ger­mi­na­tion.</p>
    <p>An­other rea­son could be non-ideal seed ger­mi­na­tion con­di­tions. If you are us­ing tis­sue pa­per, en­sure that it is nei­ther too wet nor dry as ei­ther con­di­tion can im­pede ger­mi­na­tion. The tis­sue pa­per should be moist – not drip­ping wet – and be placed in a covered con­tainer to pre­vent it from dry­ing out.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, sun­flow­ers can be chal­leng­ing to grow in high-rise apart­ments. They re­quire large pots – one plant should be grown in a pot of at least 30cm in di­am­e­ter and get at least six hours of di­rect sun­light. Small pots and the lack of sun­light will re­sult in weak and scrawny plants that pro­duce rather small flow­ers.</p>
