    <p>Ten to­bacco re­tail­ers who sold cig­a­rettes to peo­ple un­der the min­i­mum le­gal age had their li­cences sus­pended by the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The pun­ish­ment was meted out be­tween Au­gust last year and last month.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, the Health Sciences Au­thor­ity (HSA) said the re­tail­ers were caught by its ground sur­veil­lance and en­force­ment team.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult of the sus­pen­sion, the re­tail­ers are not al­lowed to sell to­bacco prod­ucts dur­ing their six­month sus­pen­sion pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Six out of the 10 re­tail­ers have been fined amounts rang­ing from $1,500 to $2,000, with in­ves­ti­ga­tions un­der way for the re­main­ing cases.</p>
    <p>With ef­fect from Jan 1 this year, the min­i­mum le­gal age to use, pos­sess or buy to­bacco prod­ucts is 20 years old, up from 19. It will be raised to 21 years old from Jan 1 next year.</p>
    <p>“To­bacco re­tail li­censees are re­minded that they are re­spon­si­ble for all trans­ac­tions of to­bacco prod­ucts tak­ing place at their out­lets, as well as the ac­tions of their em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>“Sell­ers take the risk of con­tra­ven­ing the laws if they as­sess age by mere phys­i­cal ap­pear­ance of the buyer,” the HSA said.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the HSA’s list of sus­pended and re­voked re­tail li­cences, seven re­tail­ers have had their li­cences sus­pended or re­voked to date this year.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 16 re­tail­ers had their li­cences sus­pended or re­voked last year, down from 27 in 2018 and 29 in 2017.</p>
    <p>Be­tween 2015 and last month, 102 li­cences were sus­pended and 16 were re­voked.</p>
    <p>Those caught sell­ing to­bacco prod­ucts to un­der­age buy­ers can be fined up to $5,000 for the first of­fence and up to $10,000 for the sec­ond or sub­se­quent of­fence.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the to­bacco re­tail li­cence of the seller will be sus­pended for six months for the first of­fence and re­voked for the sec­ond of­fence.</p>
    <p>If any out­let is caught sell­ing to­bacco prod­ucts to un­der­age buy­ers in school uni­form or those be­low the age of 12, the to­bacco re­tail li­cence will be re­voked, even if it is the first of­fence.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the pub­lic who have in­for­ma­tion on the il­le­gal sale or sup­ply of to­bacco prod­ucts to un­der­age peo­ple can re­port the mat­ter to the To­bacco Reg­u­la­tion Branch via the on­line form or call 6684-2036 or 6684-2037 dur­ing of­fice hours.</p>
