    <p>All schools moved to full home­based learn­ing (HBL) on April 8, the day af­ter the cir­cuit breaker started. While a wholly re­mote ex­pe­ri­ence is far from an ideal sub­sti­tute for class­room learn­ing, it al­lowed stu­dents to keep learn­ing un­der the ex­cep­tional cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>HBL com­prised on­line and off­line modes of learn­ing.</p>
    <p>Like many teach­ers, Mrs Jayasutha Vijaya had to ex­plore in­no­va­tive ways to keep her stu­dents en­gaged and con­nected with her.</p>
    <p>Daily les­sons were taught us­ing Pow­erPoint Mix, with recorded les­sons to sim­u­late a class­room ex­pe­ri­ence and in­ter­ac­tive tools for stu­dents to com­mu­ni­cate with her as well as each other.</p>
    <p>HBL was hard in other ways for Mrs Vijaya, who has three chil­dren – one in sec­ondary school and two in pri­mary school. She had to jug­gle teach­ing with tak­ing care of them, es­pe­cially the youngest child.</p>
    <p>To man­age, she asked the older ones to help look af­ter the youngest sib­lings. Af­ter les­sons came fam­ily time, which was spent play­ing games or watch­ing movies.</p>
    <p>Her hus­band, who is an en­gi­neer and has to work on site, helped when he got home from work, so she could pre­pare her les­sons for the next day.</p>
