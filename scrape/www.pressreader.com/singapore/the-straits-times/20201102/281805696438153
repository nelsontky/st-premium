    <p>When China or­dered fac­to­ries to shut at the height of the coron­avirus out­break in Fe­bru­ary, the ex­port-de­pen­dent tech­no­log­i­cal and elec­tron­ics hub of Shen­zhen was se­verely hit.</p>
    <p>The city’s econ­omy shrank 6.6 per cent in the first quar­ter, its worst-ever de­cline in four decades, of­fi­cial fig­ures show.</p>
    <p>Yet boosted by a surge in the pro­duc­tion of med­i­cal sup­plies, an in­creased de­mand for elec­tron­ics and tech ser­vices, the city staged a re­mark­able re­cov­ery in its se­cond quar­ter. Its gross do­mes­tic prod­uct for the first half of this year stood at 1.26 tril­lion yuan (S$257 bil­lion), an in­crease of 0.1 per cent.</p>
    <p>But there are con­cerns about the sus­tain­abil­ity of the growth given weak in­ter­na­tional de­mand amid a global re­ces­sion, as well as the lin­ger­ing ef­fects of the trade war be­tween China and the United States. This has led Beijing to fo­cus on “dual cir­cu­la­tion”, an eco­nomic frame­work in­creas­ing em­pha­sis on do­mes­tic con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>In Shen­zhen’s tech and man­u­fac­tur­ing-driven econ­omy, the pan­demic has been key to its re­bound.</p>
    <p>With much of the coun­try or­dered to stay home in Fe­bru­ary and March dur­ing the height of the coron­avirus out­break, con­sumers turned their fo­cus to elec­tronic de­vices like com­put­ers and tablets, as well as ap­pli­ances re­lated to health and well­ness such as ther­mome­ters and air pu­ri­fiers.</p>
    <p>Tech gi­ant Huawei, de­spite be­ing at the heart of US-China ten­sions, re­ported an in­crease in sales of de­vices in­clud­ing mo­bile phones, as well as a spike in de­mand for com­mu­ni­ca­tions in­fra­struc­ture as more peo­ple worked re­motely. Last month, it re­ported prof­its for the first three quar­ters of this year, and said it will con­tinue “con­tribut­ing to... eco­nomic growth”.</p>
    <p>HOME ELEC­TRON­ICS</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Guangzhou-based re­search house iiMe­dia Re­search, some 170.5 bil­lion yuan worth of smart home prod­ucts, or about 229 mil­lion units, are ex­pected to have been sold in the do­mes­tic mar­ket this year. Com­pa­nies man­u­fac­tur­ing med­i­cal equip­ment have also ben­e­fited, with at least one ther­mome­ter man­u­fac­turer re­port­ing or­der books filled till “the mid­dle of next year”.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one is or­der­ing ther­mome­ters th­ese days, we can’t make them fast enough,” said the man­ager of a med­i­cal de­vice man­u­fac­tur­ing plant who de­clined to be named.</p>
    <p>The com­pany usu­ally makes half a mil­lion sets of equip­ment, in­clud­ing in­frared and in-ear ther­mome­ters, neb­u­lis­ers and blood pres­sure mon­i­tors, the man­ager said. But since the pan­demic, it has in­creased pro­duc­tion ca­pac­ity by 20 per cent.</p>
    <p>“Trade war or not, when there’s a global pan­demic and coun­tries need med­i­cal equip­ment, they still have to turn to the fac­tory of the world – China,” he said.</p>
    <p>Pre-pan­demic, ex­port-fo­cused man­u­fac­tur­ers were badly hit amid trade ten­sions be­tween the world’s top two economies when clients started man­u­fac­tur­ing in In­dia and Viet­nam in­stead, said Mr Jacky Chen, gen­eral man­ager of con­tract man­u­fac­turer AQS.</p>
    <p>“But a num­ber have ended up com­ing back be­cause they re­alise that the cost of pro­duc­tion is still cheaper here,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“You can set up a fac­tory any­where in the world, but where else is there a lo­gis­tics and sup­ply chain that can repli­cate the one here (in Guang­dong prov­ince).”</p>
    <p>Raw ma­te­rial sup­pli­ers are lo­cated at the very most two hours away from fac­to­ries, which are mostly within an hour by road from ports where ships stand ready to ex­port to the world.</p>
    <p>“Even if there’s a part in the man­u­fac­tur­ing process where some­thing goes wrong and needs to be fixed, we can eas­ily call for parts that ar­rive within hours in­stead of days,” Mr Chen added.</p>
    <p>GREATER BAY AREA</p>
    <p>Much of Shen­zhen’s growth is tied to that of the Pearl River Delta, bet­ter known as the Greater Bay Area, which in­cludes Hong Kong, Ma­cau and nine Chi­nese ci­ties in Guang­dong prov­ince.</p>
    <p>The re­gion of some 70 mil­lion is part of the cen­tral gov­ern­ment’s plan to drive in­no­va­tion, en­trepreneur­ship and growth, and is in­tended to ri­val Tokyo Bay or San Fran­cisco-Sil­i­con Val­ley.</p>
    <p>While com­pa­nies are of­ten head­quar­tered and listed in Shen­zhen or Hong Kong, man­u­fac­tur­ing has been spread out to ar­eas like Dong­guan, Shunde and Zhuhai.</p>
    <p>Go­ing for­ward, Shen­zhen is also likely to play a lead­ing role in the coun­try be­com­ing a tech power by 2035, a goal an­nounced af­ter a meet­ing of top Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party lead­ers last week.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, the city is be­ing used as a test bed for some of the gov­ern­ment’s more in­no­va­tive poli­cies, in­clud­ing its first roll-out of dig­i­tal cur­rency.</p>
    <p>“China’s pur­suit of in­no­va­tion has never been en­closed or ex­clu­sive. It is based on mu­tual re­spect, mu­tual learn­ing. We will not shut our door to the world in pur­su­ing in­no­va­tion,” Science and Tech­nol­ogy Min­is­ter Wang Zhi­gang said last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Yet months af­ter the coron­avirus pan­demic has come un­der con­trol in the main­land, the city re­mains shut off to the world.</p>
    <p>Luowu, where the bustling bor­der cross­ing with Hong Kong is lo­cated, was mostly empty when The Straits Times vis­ited in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>A stone’s throw away in Huaqiang­bei in Shen­zhen, the world’s largest elec­tron­ics mar­ket, an open plaza be­tween malls where traders wheel­ing carts and trol­ley bags jos­tle with one an­other, was mostly clear.</p>
    <p>“Many of our in­ter­na­tional cus­tomers have been un­able to come back in be­cause of travel re­stric­tions, so we’ve been forced to in­no­vate in the way we do busi­ness,” said Ms Amanda Jing, who works as a mid­dle­man con­nect­ing en­trepreneur­s with pro­to­type mak­ers and hard­ware sup­pli­ers.</p>
    <p>Her firm has part­nered en­gi­neers who help clients stuck out­side China to re­motely as­sem­ble pro­to­types in Shen­zhen, while con­duct­ing test­ing on the de­vices and send­ing over the data.</p>
    <p>“It’s not ideal be­cause peo­ple would pre­fer to work on the ma­chine them­selves... but there’s no choice. If not, projects get de­layed,” she said.</p>
    <p>One such client is Sin­ga­pore­based Green Li-ion, which builds bat­tery-re­cy­cling robots. The com­pany is work­ing with en­gi­neers from Hax, an ac­cel­er­a­tor for hard­ware start-ups, to fine-tune its pro­to­type, while its founders have been un­able to travel to China.</p>
    <p>“We own four patents and a lot of the tech­nol­ogy are trade se­crets,” said Green Li-ion chief ex­ec­u­tive Leon Far­rant. “To build things to an in­dus­trial scale, (chief tech­ni­cal of­fi­cer) Reza (Katal) needs to be in Shen­zhen, in the same room with the ma­chine.”</p>
    <p>There are also con­cerns of whether the cur­rent eco­nomic growth, much of which is in di­rect re­sponse to the pan­demic, can be sus­tained.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Chen: “The virus will go away, but the US-China ten­sions are the big prob­lem. We’ve been buffered this year by in­creased de­mand for house­hold elec­tron­ics, but what next?”</p>
