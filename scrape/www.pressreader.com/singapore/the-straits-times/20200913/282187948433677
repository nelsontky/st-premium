    <p>Some­one in Chi­na­town has been mur­dered and, in one of the worst policing de­ci­sions ever made, the case has been en­trusted to us, a group of five sexy de­tec­tives known more for their youth and smoul­der­ing good looks than smarts.</p>
    <p>Solv­ing the crime will re­quire dili­gence and a sharp mind. At 10am in the morn­ing, just out­side Chi­na­town MRT sta­tion, sur­rounded by cafes and hawker stalls from which de­li­cious smells are waft­ing, both are in short sup­ply.</p>
    <p>The mys­tery-solv­ing walk­a­bout, called Chi­na­town Mur­ders, is a new one or­gan­ised by Tribe, a tour com­pany.</p>
    <p>Keep­ing us fo­cused on the case – and stop­ping us from wan­der­ing off to eat – is Ms Elaine Low, our guide and sto­ry­teller.</p>
    <p>As our two groups of five de­tec­tives move along Sago Street, Pagoda Street, South Bridge Road and Tem­ple Street, she tells us sto­ries of her child­hood here, when it was a busy cen­tre of com­merce and wor­ship, and bul­lock carts trans­ported wa­ter along its streets.</p>
    <p>I de­duced that she was speak­ing in char­ac­ter, as she is only 42, not 110 – proof that maybe we are not so dumb af­ter all.</p>
    <p>From time to time, we stop to solve puz­zles.</p>
    <p>Th­ese are based on our sur­round­ings – the colours of shop­houses, the de­signs of tem­ples – and each suc­cess­ful so­lu­tion prompts the game mas­ters fol­low­ing us to hand us a new piece of in­for­ma­tion that elim­i­nates a sus­pect from the pro­vided list.</p>
    <p>This walk­ing form of Cluedo will not finger the killer as the but­ler who did it in the li­brary. More in keep­ing with the dis­trict’s his­tory, it is more like the coolie who did it close by the tem­ple.</p>
    <p>There are two teams of five par­tic­i­pants each. Do you know what hap­pens when there are two teams</p>
    <p>com­prised of mostly Sin­ga­pore­ans in a game of men­tal prow­ess?</p>
    <p>That is right, you get a duel. A show­down. All is for­got­ten as we re­live our school years.</p>
    <p>We start by play­ing it cool, read­ing the ques­tions and act­ing ca­sual. We are told to keep it fun. But our Sin­ga­porean in­stincts kick in. We can­not help it.</p>
    <p>I be­gin eye­ing the other team,</p>
    <p>see­ing if they are get­ting ahead. When we are told to prowl an area for clues, steps grow quicker as we ap­proach the close of the game.</p>
    <p>As our sto­ry­teller, Ms Low says at one point: “I know you’re not lis­ten­ing to me be­cause you just want to get to the puz­zle, right?”</p>
    <p>What gave it away? The crazed look in our eyes? The way I stood in the rain, not notic­ing how wet I was get­ting, to look at a tem­ple de­sign in­stead of tak­ing a photo of it to in­spect un­der shel­ter?</p>
    <p>The way quicker folks snatch the ques­tion sheets from my hand to solve puz­zles solo with­out say­ing a word to oth­ers on the team? (Oh yes, I am still sore about that one.)</p>
    <p>Gam­i­fy­ing a tour makes it more en­gag­ing, but it can be a blow to the ego for those who are a tad slower in logic-spa­tial skills.</p>
    <p>I am not speak­ing of my­self, of course. I could solve the puz­zles eas­ily if I wanted to.</p>
    <p>It is just that as a man of cul­ture, I was dis­tracted by the area’s rich his­tory and ar­chi­tec­ture.</p>
