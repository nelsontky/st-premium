    <p>Two groups, each com­pris­ing 20 peo­ple or more, are un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion for al­legedly breach­ing safe dis­tanc­ing rules at Sin­ga­pore’s na­ture re­serves.</p>
    <p>One in­volves 26 hik­ers who at­tempted to go off-trail il­le­gally in the Cen­tral Catch­ment Na­ture Re­serve, the largest on the is­land.</p>
    <p>The other is a group of 20 who gath­ered for a birth­day cel­e­bra­tion at Labrador Na­ture Re­serve, said the Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment (MSE).</p>
    <p>Of greater con­cern is that th­ese two groups are not the only ones be­ing in­ves­ti­gated for pos­si­ble vi­o­la­tion of Covid-19 safety mea­sures, nor are they the big­gest groups.</p>
    <p>The min­istry re­vealed on Thurs­day that a group of 50 peo­ple is also be­ing in­ves­ti­gated. The New Pa­per un­der­stands this is the largest group linked to such a breach since safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures were put in place in March.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to queries from TNP, an MSE spokesman said th­ese in­ci­dents are among a spate of re­cent cases in­volv­ing 12 to 50 peo­ple in­ter­min­gling in large groups at var­i­ous parks, birth­day cel­e­bra­tions, baby show­ers, food and bev­er­age out­lets, and bas­ket­ball and foot­ball games at Hous­ing Board es­tate courts.</p>
    <p>Th­ese cases are un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion and the ap­pro­pri­ate en­force­ment ac­tion will be taken, she added.</p>
    <p>Not­ing the re­cent in­crease in such gath­er­ings, the spokesman added: “It is im­por­tant for all of us to re­main vig­i­lant and ad­here to safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures to avoid a resur­gence of cases as seen in other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“We have been able to keep the num­ber of Covid-19 cases low due to the ma­jor­ity play­ing their part.</p>
    <p>“With the fes­tive sea­son com­ing up, and as we make the tran­si­tion to phase three, it is even more cru­cial for us to ad­here to th­ese mea­sures so that we can con­tinue to keep our com­mu­nity safe.”</p>
    <p>Un­der the cur­rent phase two of the coun­try’s re­open­ing, so­cial gath­er­ings of up to five peo­ple are al­lowed with safety mea­sures such as the wear­ing of masks.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Grace Fu voiced con­cern in a Face­book post on Tues­day about the “in­creas­ing num­ber of fla­grant vi­o­la­tions of the rules”.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tious diseases ex­perts warned that this is not the time for com­pla­cency, de­spite the drop in com­mu­nity cases.</p>
    <p>With re­cip­ro­cal green lanes es­tab­lished be­tween Sin­ga­pore and coun­tries like Malaysia and Ja­pan and the im­mi­nent air travel bub­ble with Hong Kong, an un­de­tected case of the virus could slip through, said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, a spe­cial­ist at Mount El­iz­a­beth Novena Hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>“Our de­fence of masks and so­cial dis­tanc­ing must hold. If not, we will see a new wave of com­mu­nity spread,” he added.</p>
    <p>“I would en­cour­age ev­ery­one to not give up the huge gains that we have achieved.”</p>
    <p>An­other ex­pert, Dr Ling Li Min, who is also based at Mount El­iz­a­beth Novena, said the re­cent rise in breaches sug­gests that peo­ple may be suf­fer­ing from Covid-19 mea­sure fa­tigue.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she stressed the im­por­tance of re­main­ing so­cially re­spon­si­ble, as stud­ies have shown that gath­er­ing in large groups in close prox­im­ity re­sults in an es­ti­mated sec­ondary in­fec­tion rate of up to 53 per cent should some­one in the group have the virus.</p>
    <p>“Get­ting to where we are now with our low com­mu­nity in­fec­tion rates has been a chal­lenge, and we have seen from the ex­pe­ri­ences of other coun­tries how easy it is for a new clus­ter of in­fec­tions to form,” she added.</p>
    <p>“Let us not be tempted to let our guard down now.”</p>
