    <p>Scep­ti­cism and a wari­ness of deals that are too good to be true are the first line of de­fence against be­ing scammed, said Mr Ger­ald Sing­ham, chair­man of the Na­tional Crime Pre­ven­tion Coun­cil (NCPC).</p>
    <p>In the first half of this year, there were 7,253 re­ported scam cases in the top 10 scam cat­e­gories – more than dou­ble the 3,027 cases re­ported in the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>This makes con­stant vig­i­lance all the more im­por­tant now as scam­mers have de­vel­oped cre­ative ways to carry out their ne­far­i­ous ac­tiv­i­ties: us­ing tech­nol­ogy to mask their numbers, or em­ploy­ing new meth­ods to fil­ter scores of po­ten­tial vic­tims in search of an ideal tar­get.</p>
    <p>Mr Sing­ham high­lighted the need for a healthy dose of scep­ti­cism and vig­i­lance, par­tic­u­larly when re­ceiv­ing du­bi­ous calls or mes­sages.</p>
    <p>“There is no vac­cine against scams. The best way to in­oc­u­late our­selves against them is to be vig­i­lant, to be watch­ful, and to spot the signs,” he said.</p>
    <p>To this end, the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force and the NCPC yes­ter­day rolled out the sixth edi­tion of their an­nual anti-scam cam­paign: “Spot the signs. Stop the crimes.”</p>
    <p>The cam­paign will run from this month to March next year, with a fo­cus on shar­ing real scam ex­am­ples with the pub­lic to ed­u­cate them on how to spot the var­i­ous tell­tale signs of scams, in­clud­ing im­per­son­ation scams and credit-for-sex scams.</p>
    <p>The launch fol­lows the re­lease of statis­tics on Wed­nes­day in­di­cat­ing the 139 per cent year-on-year rise in cases in the top 10 scam cat­e­gories for the first six months of this year.</p>
    <p>E-com­merce scams, so­cial me­dia im­per­son­ation ruses, loan scams and bank­ing-re­lated scams topped the list of com­mon scams, with surges in the num­ber of cases in each of th­ese cat­e­gories.</p>
    <p>The amount lost in the top 10 scam cat­e­gories al­most dou­bled in the half-year pe­riod to $82 mil­lion from $41.6 mil­lion in the first six months of last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Sing­ham en­cour­aged mem­bers of the pub­lic not only to stop and think be­fore re­veal­ing per­sonal de­tails or hand­ing over one-time pass­words, but also to take the ex­tra step to ver­ify in­for­ma­tion with a third party or the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“The onus must be on us – the po­ten­tial vic­tim – to stop the crimes from hap­pen­ing and cut off com­mu­ni­ca­tion be­fore any im­por­tant in­for­ma­tion can be di­vulged,” he said.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple should be more vig­i­lant as scam­mers might cre­ate fake pro­files to as­sume the iden­ti­ties of an old friend or fam­ily mem­ber, to get one to un­wit­tingly part with cash.</p>
    <p>In the in­stance of John (not his real name), 20, a scam­mer made off with around $1,400 from his bank ac­count last month af­ter dup­ing him into hand­ing over three Shopee one-time ver­i­fi­ca­tion codes.</p>
    <p>The scam­mer posed as John’s sec­ondary school friend from Malaysia – whom he had not spo­ken to for two to three years – by du­pli­cat­ing the friend’s In­sta­gram pro­file, and then chat­ted with him.</p>
    <p>The scam­mer claimed that in or­der to join a lu­cra­tive con­test on Shopee, John had to give the scam­mer sev­eral six-digit codes to his ac­count that were sent to his phone.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t even think about it and didn’t ask for ver­i­fi­ca­tion be­fore send­ing over the one-time PINs be­cause I thought it was my friend,” John said. “It was only af­ter I saw to my shock that the money was gone from my bank ac­count that I thought to check if it was re­ally her.”</p>
