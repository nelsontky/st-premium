    <p>A near three-month shut­down sent Ma­rina Bay Sands (MBS) deep into the red in the sec­ond quar­ter, with a loss of US$113 mil­lion (S$156.3 mil­lion). This was a marked re­verse from the US$346 mil­lion profit it made in the same pe­riod last year, noted par­ent com­pany Las Ve­gas Sands on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>A near three-month shut­down sent Ma­rina Bay Sands (MBS) deep into the red in the sec­ond quar­ter, with a loss of US$113 mil­lion (S$156.3 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>This was a marked re­verse from the US$346 mil­lion profit it made in the same pe­riod last year, noted par­ent com­pany Las Ve­gas Sands (LVS) on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The fig­ures re­fer to Ebitda, or earn­ings be­fore in­ter­est, tax, de­pre­ci­a­tion and amor­ti­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The eye-wa­ter­ing hit MBS has taken from the shut­down can be seen in its rev­enue per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>Turnover for the three months to June 30 plunged from US$688 mil­lion a year be­fore to US$23 mil­lion, with casino rev­enue div­ing from US$468 mil­lion to US$7 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Sales from other oper­a­tions like rooms, food and bev­er­age, mall and con­ven­tion came in at US$16 mil­lion, down from US$220 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>United States-based LVS has not an­nounced any lay­offs, and told an­a­lysts in an earn­ings call that it would con­tinue with its pre­vi­ously an­nounced cap­i­tal ex­pen­di­ture pro­grammes in Ma­cau and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>MBS de­clined to com­ment yes­ter­day, but The Straits Times un­der­stands the com­pany, which had about 10,000 full-time em­ploy­ees last year, is still hir­ing and has not re­trenched any staff.</p>
    <p>The $9 bil­lion ex­pan­sion plans an­nounced last year by Sin­ga­pore’s two in­te­grated re­sorts (IRs) were called into ques­tion af­ter Re­sorts World Sen­tosa (RWS) said last week it would be lay­ing off staff.</p>
    <p>But RWS has con­firmed that it will con­tinue with its de­vel­op­ment plans, which are slated for com­ple­tion by 2025.</p>
    <p>LVS chief ex­ec­u­tive Shel­don Adel­son told the earn­ings call that progress is be­ing made on the MBS ex­pan­sion, but de­lays to its sched­uled 2023 com­ple­tion are likely. He said: “These are prin­ci­pally re­lated to the im­pact of the pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>The com­mit­ment to ex­pand pri­mar­ily non-gam­ing of­fer­ings sealed the deal for RWS and MBS to ex­tend their ex­clu­sive rights to run casi­nos here un­til the end of 2030. The $4.5 bil­lion MBS plans in­clude a fourth ho­tel tower, an en­ter­tain­ment arena and ad­di­tional events space.</p>
    <p>LVS it­self swung to a net loss of US$985 mil­lion for the three months to June 30, com­pared with a net profit of US$1.11 bil­lion in the same quar­ter last year. Rev­enue dived 97.1 per cent to US$98 mil­lion from US$3.33 bil­lion pre­vi­ously, on the back of global clo­sures of its casi­nos due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s IRs re­mained shut be­yond the two-month cir­cuit breaker, which be­gan on April 7.</p>
    <p>A grad­ual re­sump­tion of oper­a­tions be­gan ear­lier this month, with casino ac­cess lim­ited to mem­bers and an­nual levy hold­ers for now.</p>
    <p>At­trac­tions, deemed higher-risk for virus transmissi­on, re­open from this month, sub­ject to ca­pac­ity lim­its and ap­proval. Some ho­tels, in­clud­ing those at the IRs, have also been given the green light to of­fer stay­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>MBS said some venues in its com­plex, such as the Sands Expo and Con­ven­tion Cen­tre, theatre and Mar­quee night­club, would re­sume oper­a­tions later, in line with of­fi­cial guide­lines.</p>
    <p>LVS chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer Rob Gold­stein told an­a­lysts he was con­fi­dent that MBS could break even in the near term, de­spite Sin­ga­pore’s re­stric­tions on vis­i­tors and so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>While the re­sort may be “hand­i­capped”, ow­ing to air travel re­stric­tions, it ben­e­fits from a strong clien­tele of af­flu­ent per­ma­nent res­i­dents, he said, not­ing that the casino is see­ing a re­turn of vis­i­tors, and some de­mand for stay­ca­tions is also ex­pected.</p>
    <p>“We feel pos­i­tive about what’s hap­pen­ing in Sin­ga­pore... It’s our best prospect as we speak to­day, a much bet­ter po­si­tion than we are (at) in Las Ve­gas.”</p>
    <p>Mr Adel­son said in a state­ment that the com­pany is see­ing early stages of re­cov­ery in each of its mar­kets, and re­mains op­ti­mistic about an even­tual re­cov­ery of travel and tourism spend­ing as well as fu­ture growth prospects.</p>
