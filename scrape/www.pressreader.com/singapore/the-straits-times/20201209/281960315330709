    <p>Ia­gree with Dr Wil­liam Wan that the re­cent news of the el­derly woman dy­ing at home alone with­out any­one know­ing is not only pro­foundly de­press­ing, but also says a lot about the so­ci­ety we are liv­ing in (Am I my neigh­bour’s keeper? The tragedy of those who die alone, Dec 7).</p>
    <p>We live in a First World coun­try with a su­perb gov­ern­ment, liv­ing stan­dards and en­vi­ron­ment. How­ever, all this ex­em­plary hard­ware be­comes mean­ing­less and hol­low if ev­ery­one goes about car­ing only about his own busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Dr Wan men­tioned some in­ter­est­ing points to ad­dress the prob­lems. I think an­other vi­able so­lu­tion would be to re­vive the reg­u­lar house-to-house vis­its by po­lice of­fi­cers that were ini­ti­ated by the neigh­bour­hood po­lice post (NPP) sys­tem many years ago.</p>
    <p>As a re­tired po­lice of­fi­cer, I re­mem­ber serv­ing in the now-de­funct Kuo Chuan NPP and hav­ing to make reg­u­lar house vis­its to HDB blocks in Toa Payoh dur­ing the 1980s.</p>
    <p>Though it was te­dious work, it served an im­por­tant role for the po­lice to know who lived in each unit and what prob­lems they faced. We also knew who was liv­ing alone and re­ferred those with prob­lems to so­cial ser­vices if the need arose.</p>
    <p>I re­mem­ber how res­i­dents treated the neigh­bour­hood po­lice of­fi­cers as friends that they could chat with and pro­vide valu­able in­for­ma­tion to.</p>
    <p>The com­mu­nity po­lice of­fi­cers’ reg­u­lar house vis­its pro­vided an ex­tra layer of as­sur­ance in en­sur­ing that the el­derly did not live or die in iso­la­tion.</p>
    <p>These el­derly res­i­dents could at least be com­forted, know­ing that there would be some­one who cared enough to knock on their doors to check on them.</p>
