    <p>With the number of Covid-19 cases in Singapore on a down­trend and plans in place to have more re­gional screen­ing cen­tres, poly­clin­ics here will be con­duct­ing fewer swab tests to bet­ter focus on chronic dis­ease man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Health Janil Puthuc­heary said that pa­tients who are re­ferred by their gen­eral prac­ti­tion­ers (GPs) to the poly­clin­ics to have a Covid-19 swab test will now be re­ferred to the re­gional screen­ing cen­tres in­stead.</p>
    <p>These pa­tients come un­der the Swab And Send Home (Sash) pro­gramme, where they are swabbed and sent home to wait for their test re­sults.</p>
    <p>The sam­ples are sent to a lab­o­ra­tory, where test­ing can take up to three work­ing days.</p>
    <p>There are 400 GPs and 20 poly­clin­ics un­der the Sash pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>“We will in­crease the number of re­gional screen­ing cen­tres to about 25 to 30 by the end of the year, so that more and more of this work can then be off­loaded from the poly­clinic,” said Dr Janil, who is also Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has said it will set up more of these cen­tres as well as in-dor­mi­tory test­ing fa­cil­i­ties by the end of the year, to scale up rou­tine Covid-19 swab test­ing for mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>Dr Janil said that pri­mary care fa­cil­i­ties will al­ways have an im­por­tant role in look­ing af­ter those who may have Covid-19, and that those who seek help for “acute res­pi­ra­tory ill­nesses, par­tic­u­larly, will have a swab and some of those swabs are done on site”.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a visit yes­ter­day to Ang Mo Kio Poly­clinic, Dr Janil thanked health­care work­ers.</p>
    <p>He said pri­vate prac­ti­tion­ers and the health­care staff at the poly­clin­ics have had to carry on look­ing af­ter pa­tients with chronic diseases, on top of fight­ing Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Dr Janil noted: “We have 950 pub­lic health pre­pared­ness clin­ics, which, to­gether with 20 poly­clin­ics, have been at the front line for com­mu­nity care against Covid-19.”</p>
