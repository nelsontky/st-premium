    <p>SAN FRAN­CISCO • Face­book, for the first time, has dis­closed num­bers on the preva­lence of hate speech on its plat­form, say­ing that out of ev­ery 10,000 con­tent views in the third quar­ter, 10 to 11 in­cluded hate speech.</p>
    <p>The world’s largest so­cial me­dia firm, un­der scru­tiny over its polic­ing of abuses, par­tic­u­larly around the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, re­leased the es­ti­mate in its quar­terly con­tent mod­er­a­tion re­port.</p>
    <p>Face­book said it took ac­tion on 22.1 mil­lion pieces of hate speech con­tent i n the third quar­ter, about 95 per cent of which was proac­tively iden­ti­fied, com­pared with 22.5 mil­lion in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>The com­pany de­fines “tak­ing ac­tion” as re­mov­ing con­tent, cov­er­ing it with a warn­ing, dis­abling ac­counts, or es­ca­lat­ing it to ex­ter­nal agen­cies.</p>
    <p>This sum­mer, civil rights groups or­gan­ised a wide­spread ad­ver­tis­ing boy­cott to try to pres­sure Face­book to act against hate speech.</p>
    <p>The com­pany agreed to dis­close the hate speech met­ric, cal­cu­lated by ex­am­in­ing a rep­re­sen­ta­tive sam­ple of con­tent seen on Face­book, and sub­mit it­self to an in­de­pen­dent au­dit of its en­force­ment record.</p>
    <p>On a call with re­porters, Face­book head of safety and in­tegrity Guy Rosen said the au­dit would be com­pleted “over the course of 2021”.</p>
    <p>The Anti-Defama­tion League (ADL), one of the groups be­hind the boy­cott, said that Face­book’s new met­ric still lacked suf­fi­cient con­text for a full as­sess­ment of its per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>“We still don’t know from this re­port ex­actly how many pieces of con­tent users are flag­ging to Face­book – whether or not ac­tion was taken,” said ADL spokesman Todd Gut­nick. That data mat­ters, he said, as “there are many forms of hate speech that are not be­ing re­moved, even af­ter they’re flagged”.</p>
    <p>Ri­vals Twit­ter and YouTube, owned by Al­pha­bet Inc’s Google, do not dis­close com­pa­ra­ble preva­lence met­rics.</p>
    <p>Mr Rosen also said that from March 1 un­til the Nov 3 elec­tion, the com­pany re­moved more than 265,000 pieces of con­tent from Face­book and In­sta­gram in the United States for vi­o­lat­ing its voter in­ter­fer­ence poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Face­book said it took ac­tion on 19.2 mil­lion pieces of vi­o­lent and graphic con­tent in the third quar­ter, up from 15 mil­lion in the sec­ond. On In­sta­gram, it took ac­tion on 4.1 mil­lion pieces of vi­o­lent and graphic con­tent.</p>
