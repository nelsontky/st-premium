Nov 17, 2020
Four Crew-1 astronauts arrived safely for a six-month stay. May 31, 2020
Nasa’s commercial spacecraft successful­ly ferried two astronauts to the ISS. The solar array wingspan (73m) is about the same length as the the Airbus A-380. Canadarm 2
The 16.7m robotic arm plays a key role in the constructi­on of the ISS and in its daily operations. Research and education Quest airlock
Allows astronauts to perform spacewalks Zvezda (2000) INTERNATIO­NAL COOPERATIO­N US Russia Japan Europe Canada Radiators (2000) Remove excess heat from the ISS to space. Unity (Node 1) Pirs airlock or docking port The first human habitation module in space. It is also a docking port for Russian cargo, crew vehicles and the Automated Transfer Vehicle (AT V ) cargo craft. Integrated truss structure It forms the backbone of the ISS. Habitation
The living and working area (388 cubic metres) is about the passenger cabin volume of a Boeing 747 jet. At any one time, the station can accommodat­e 7 crew members for between three and six months. ‘Bulletproo­f vest’
10cm layers of Kevlar, ceramic fabrics and other advanced materials cover the module's aluminium shell to withstand harsh conditions of space. Columbus Lab (2008) European Space Agency ’s single contributi­on to the ISS. It supports scientific and technologi­cal research. Length: 6.9m Width: 4.5m How the ISS measures Length: 109m
Width: 75m Tranquilit­y or Node 3 (2010) The last module that was added to the ISS. It has environmen­tal control and life support systems, a toilet, exercise equipment and an observatio­n cupola. Size
The ISS is as big as a full-size soccer field. Soccer field: Length: 110m Width: 75m Weight: 6,000kg Weight of ISS: 420 tonnes, about the weight of 70 African bush elephants 1998
• ZARYA: First piece of ISS launched 1981
• Extravehic­ular Mobility Unit
(EMU) or spacesuit unveiled 1984
• ISS programme: President Ronald Reagan directs ISS constructi­on 1st node connected.
- 3 EVAs: 21hrs 22mins 2000
• Solar Array Wings: 18 EVAs in total • Harmony: 2nd node connected. - 4 EVAs: 27hrs 14mins MILESTONES Celebratin­g the milestones and the extravehic­ular activities (EVAs) or spacewalks made outside of the ISS. 2007 2001
• Destiny Laboratory: - 3 EVAs: 19hrs 48mins • Canadarm preparatio­n: - Longest single EVA: 8hrs 55mins - 2 EVAs: 15hrs 17mins 2010
• Tranquilit­y:
3rd node connected. - 3 EVAs: 18hrs 14mins 2019
• First all-female EVA: 7hrs 17mins 2023
• Nasa’s nextgenera­tion spacesuit, xEMU (Exploratio­n Extravehic­ular Mobility Unit) ISS demo 2011
• ISS assembly completed Soyuz (1960s)
Designed in the 60s, it remains the workhorse of the Russian space programme and provides emergency return capabiliti­es for the ISS. Zarya (1998) US-funded and Russian-built, it was the first piece of ISS to be put into orbit. Destiny Lab (2001) Primary research lab for US payloads and is used to conduct scientific research. Cupola (2010)
The observator­y provides a panaromic view and facilitate­s operations. Power
Four pairs of solar arrays generate 84-120 kilowatts of power, enough to run 40 homes. KIBO Lab (2008) Japan’s research facility has an airlock and a robotic arm.
