    <p>•</p>
    <p>LON­DON Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son said he did not want an­other na­tional lock­down but that new re­stric­tions may be needed be­cause the coun­try was fac­ing an “in­evitable” sec­ond wave of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>His com­ment came as Euro­pean coun­tries from Den­mark to Spain an­nounced new re­stric­tions to curb surg­ing coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions in some of their largest cities.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ters were re­ported to be con­sid­er­ing a sec­ond na­tional lock­down, af­ter new Covid-19 cases al­most dou­bled to 6,000 per day, hospi­tal ad­mis­sions rose and in­fec­tion rates soared across parts of north­ern Eng­land and Lon­don.</p>
    <p>That rise in cases was part of a sec­ond wave that was now un­stop­pable, Mr John­son said.</p>
    <p>“We are now see­ing a sec­ond wave com­ing in... It is ab­so­lutely, I’m afraid, in­evitable, that we will see it in this coun­try,” he told UK me­dia.</p>
    <p>Asked if the whole coun­try should brace it­self for a new lock­down rather than just lo­cal re­stric­tions, he said: “I don’t want to get into a sec­ond na­tional lock­down at all.”</p>
    <p>But he did not rule out fur­ther na­tional re­stric­tions be­ing brought in.</p>
    <p>The UK has re­ported the fifth largest num­ber of Covid-19 deaths in the world, af­ter the United States, Brazil, In­dia and Mex­ico, ac­cord­ing to data col­lected by Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity of Medicine.</p>
    <p>The UK’s of­fi­cial num­ber of new pos­i­tive cases rose by nearly 1,000 on Fri­day to 4,322, the high­est since May 8, af­ter an Of­fice for Na­tional Sta­tis­tics model pointed to about 6,000 new cases a day in</p>
    <p>Eng­land in the week to Sept 10.</p>
    <p>That was up from mod­el­ling of 3,200 cases per day in the pre­vi­ous week, with the North West and Lon­don seen as hot spots.</p>
    <p>The UK said its re­pro­duc­tion “R” num­ber of in­fec­tions has risen to a range of 1.1-1.4 from the pre­vi­ous week’s 1.0-1.2.</p>
    <p>“We’re see­ing clear signs this virus is now spread­ing widely across all age groups and I am par­tic­u­larly wor­ried by the in­crease in rates of ad­mis­sion to hospi­tal and in­ten­sive care among older peo­ple,” said Prof Yvonne Doyle, med­i­cal di­rec­tor at Pub­lic Health Eng­land.</p>
    <p>“This could be a warn­ing of far worse things to come.”</p>
    <p>More than 10 mil­lion peo­ple in the UK are al­ready in lo­cal lock­down.</p>
    <p>De­spite the grim out­look, thou­sands of peo­ple yes­ter­day de­scended on cen­tral Lon­don to protest against mass coro­n­avirus vac­ci­na­tions.</p>
    <p>World­wide, in­fec­tions have ex­ceeded 30.5 mil­lion cases and deaths have topped 950,000.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tions have climbed steadily across most of Europe over the last two months. In­ten­sive care ad­mis­sions and deaths have also be­gun to tick up, es­pe­cially in Spain and France.</p>
    <p>In Den­mark, where the 454 new in­fec­tions on Fri­day was close to a record of 473 in April, Prime Min­is­ter Mette Fred­erik­sen said the limit on pub­lic gath­er­ings would be low­ered to 50 peo­ple from 100 and or­dered bars and restau­rants to close early.</p>
    <p>Ice­land or­dered en­ter­tain­ment venues and pubs in the cap­i­tal area to close for four days start­ing on Fri­day un­til to­mor­row, while in Ire­land, in­door restau­rant din­ing and in­door events were banned in Dublin af­ter a surge in cases in re­cent days.</p>
    <p>In Greece, the com­mit­tee of health ex­perts rec­om­mended ex­tra curbs on pub­lic gath­er­ings, the sus­pen­sion of cul­tural events for 14 days and other mea­sures which “could be de­cided today... and go into force on Mon­day”, said Prime Min­is­ter Kyr­i­akos Mit­so­takis.</p>
