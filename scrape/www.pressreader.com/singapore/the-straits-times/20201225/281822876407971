    <p>• The Euro­pean Union trans­port com­mis­sioner warned yes­ter­day that 10,000 Euro­pean truck­ers were strug­gling to re­turn from Bri­tain and crit­i­cised France for im­pos­ing coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions on them.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral coun­tries around Europe and the world im­posed bans on travel from the United King­dom this week af­ter the dis­cov­ery of a new strain of the virus.</p>
    <p>“We is­sued a com­mu­ni­ca­tion ap­peal­ing for pro­por­tional, non-dis­crim­i­na­tory mea­sures and the lift of any re­stric­tions for trans­port work­ers,” Ms Ad­ina Valean said. “I de­plore that France went against our rec­om­men­da­tions.”</p>
    <p>But French Min­is­ter for Euro­pean Af­fairs Cle­ment Beaune de­nied this, re­spond­ing an­grily in a Twit­ter post: “We have ex­actly fol­lowed the EU rec­om­men­da­tion (open­ing with tests) and are now more open than other Euro­pean coun­tries, hav­ing worked jointly with the UK au­thor­i­ties on this.”</p>
    <p>France’s de­ci­sion to re­strict traf­fic has had the most im­pact, with trains and fer­ries across the Chan­nel halted for 48 hours and huge freight traf­fic jams built up in south-east Eng­land.</p>
    <p>“Around 10,000 truck driv­ers are seek­ing to get back in the EU. Other thou­sands are al­ready in the Dover area in their ve­hi­cles,” said Ms Valean.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion ad­vised mem­ber states to drop the blan­ket ban, and France agreed to let in driv­ers if they had neg­a­tive Covid-19 tests. But Brussels sug­gested ex­empt­ing trans­port work­ers from the re­stric­tion.</p>
    <p>“I want to thank UK au­thor­i­ties that they started test­ing the driv­ers at a ca­pac­ity of 300 tests per hour,” Ms Valean said, com­par­ing the sit­u­a­tion to the break­down in co­or­di­na­tion be­tween Euro­pean cap­i­tals in March that ham­pered early ef­forts to con­tain the virus “when the sup­ply chains were in­ter­rupted”.</p>
