    <p>With in­ter­na­tional travel open­ing up, some des­ti­na­tions are de­mand­ing pre-de­par­ture Covid-19 swabs from the coun­try of ori­gin (Trav­ellers to Tai­wan must test neg­a­tive for Covid-19, Dec 1).</p>
    <p>Most re­quire the tests to be done within three days of de­par­ture, with China re­quir­ing tests within two days of de­par­ture.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) and dif­fer­ent em­bassies have is­sued con­flict­ing in­struc­tions.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, if a flight de­parts late on Fri­day evening and pa­tients come for a swab on Wed­nes­day morn­ing, it qual­i­fies as within a two-day pe­riod but ex­ceeds 48 hours.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers have been told by the Chi­nese em­bassy that this is al­lowed, but doc­tors have been told ex­plic­itly by MOH that since it ex­ceeds 48 hours be­tween swab and de­par­ture, it doesn’t pass muster.</p>
    <p>An of­fi­cial, con­sulted on the MOH hot­line for Covid-19-re­lated mat­ters, gave the guide­line that doc­tors could pro­ceed to per­form the pre-de­par­ture swab as de­manded by pa­tients based on the cri­te­ria given to them by their em­bassies.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors can eas­ily cede re­spon­si­bil­ity for all con­se­quences as long as pa­tients are made aware of them and have un­der­signed for them, but the un­cer­tainty still leaves some dis­quiet. Telling doc­tors to seek oral con­fir­ma­tion from each em­bassy in our pri­vate ca­pac­ity is def­i­nitely not the way for­ward. Of­ten, we don’t even get a re­sponse.</p>
    <p>To pre­vent or set­tle dis­putes, a clear di­rec­tive in black and white is nec­es­sary.</p>
