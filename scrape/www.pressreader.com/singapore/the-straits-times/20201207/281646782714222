    <p>SACRA­MENTO (Cal­i­for­nia) • More than half of Cal­i­for­nia will be stuck at home this hol­i­day sea­son.</p>
    <p>The state’s two most densely in­hab­ited re­gions and its agri­cul­tural bread­bas­ket were set to see the im­po­si­tion of stay-at-home or­ders yes­ter­day night as the Covid-19 pan­demic strained hos­pi­tals, of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>De­signed to kick in when in­ten­sive care unit (ICU) ca­pac­ity in any of five re­gions falls be­low 15 per cent, the or­der af­fect­ing South­ern Cal­i­for­nia and the San Joaquin Val­ley closes bars, hair sa­lons and bar­ber shops, and al­lows restau­rants to re­main open only for take­away and de­liv­ery ser­vice.</p>
    <p>It al­lows crit­i­cal in­fra­struc­ture to stay open, in­clud­ing schools that have ob­tained waivers so in-per­son classes can be held. Den­tal of­fices will also re­main open.</p>
    <p>The shut­downs, which were sched­uled to go into ef­fect at 11.59pm yes­ter­day, were trig­gered by an or­der an­nounced last Wed­nes­day by Gover­nor Gavin New­som, a Demo­crat. The curbs will re­main in ef­fect for at least three weeks, and will be lifted on</p>
    <p>Dec 28 only if the ICU thresh­old and other met­rics are met.</p>
    <p>The San Fran­cisco Bay Area was also ex­pected to go into lock­down yes­ter­day night un­der a dif­fer­ent set of or­ders an­nounced on Fri­day by of­fi­cials there.</p>
    <p>Los An­ge­les County, with the na­tion’s high­est death toll and case count from the coro­n­avirus, had al­ready im­posed stay-at-home or­ders a week ago and will mod­ify its curbs in line with the lat­est state or­der.</p>
    <p>“We know that peo­ple are tired of the strin­gent mea­sures, but they are the only weapons we have to</p>
    <p>com­bat the virus,” said Dr Mag­gie Park, a public health of­fi­cer in San Joaquin County.</p>
    <p>The or­ders have been crit­i­cised by some Repub­li­can politi­cians, who say clos­ing small busi­nesses and or­der­ing peo­ple to stay mostly at home will do more harm than good.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials said on Satur­day that more than 25,000 new cases of Covid-19 were di­ag­nosed in Cal­i­for­nia on Fri­day, a record since the pan­demic be­gan. The state also recorded 209 deaths, bring­ing the to­tal to 19,791, of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>For the third day in a row, the United States on Satur­day notched up a record num­ber of coro­n­avirus cases in 24 hours, reach­ing nearly 230,000 new in­fec­tions, ac­cord­ing to a tally by Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity. In the same pe­riod, the US recorded 2,527 Covid-19-re­lated deaths, ac­cord­ing to real-time data pro­vided by the Bal­ti­more-based univer­sity at 8.30pm.</p>
    <p>For two weeks, the US has reg­u­larly topped 2,000 deaths a day, as it had in spring, at the height of the first wave of the coun­try’s out­break.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of peo­ple hos­pi­talised with Covid-19 is also steadily in­creas­ing, ac­cord­ing to the Covid Track­ing Pro­ject. The US has recorded more than 14.6 mil­lion Covid-19 cases and more than 281,000 re­lated deaths since the start of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Univer­sity of Wash­ing­ton’s In­sti­tute for Health Met­rics and Eval­u­a­tion now projects nearly 539,000 Covid-19 deaths by April 1 next year.</p>
    <p>In­creas­ing num­bers of chil­dren are go­ing hun­gry in the coun­try on ac­count of the eco­nomic dev­as­ta­tion caused by the pan­demic, with nearly 12 per cent of adults saying they lived in a house­hold where there was not enough to eat “some­times” or “of­ten” last month, ac­cord­ing to the Com­merce Depart­ment.</p>
    <p>Some 10 per cent of moth­ers re­ported that their chil­dren un­der the age of five went hun­gry to some de­gree in Oc­to­ber and last month, a Brook­ings In­sti­tu­tion sur­vey found.</p>
    <p>Non­profit Feed­ing Amer­ica es­ti­mates over 50 mil­lion peo­ple will be con­sid­ered food inse­cure this year, in­clud­ing about one in four chil­dren, re­vers­ing gains made in re­cent years that had brought hunger among chil­dren to its low­est level in at least two decades.</p>
    <p>Schools have shut down, mak­ing it com­pli­cated for poorer chil­dren to get free meals pro­vided there. There is also a gap for par­ents with chil­dren too young to at­tend school – the age at which poor nu­tri­tion can have life­long con­se­quences.</p>
    <p>The num­bers are jar­ring for a coun­try that has the world’s largest economy and is a ma­jor donor of food aid world­wide.</p>
    <p>They have pro­pelled a po­lit­i­cal tus­sle over Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s choice for agri­cul­ture secretary, who will be tasked with fight­ing hunger.</p>
