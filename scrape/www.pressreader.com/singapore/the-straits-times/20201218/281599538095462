    <p>When you get the in­fec­tion, you are get­ting the real thing, virus and RNA (ri­bonu­cleic acid) and all. Whereas when you get the vac­cine, you have pre­pared the body to know how to deal with it. It is like help­ing your child pre­pare for the PSLE by do­ing a few pa­pers be­fore­hand, rather than send­ing the poor kid in, com­pletely naive.</p>
    <p>CRE­ATED BY THE BEST</p>
    <p>The best minds in the world have worked on this, and we have paid good money for the vac­cines, and we have looked at them as hard as we can. So, all that work and all that re­source should not go to waste.</p>
    <p>SAFE AND EF­FEC­TIVE</p>
    <p>I am a doc­tor, I am go­ing to be one of the first groups to get jabbed. And the proof of the pud­ding is in the eat­ing... We would not rec­om­mend it un­less we felt it was ef­fec­tive, safe and of a good qual­ity.</p>

    <p>AS­SO­CIATE PRO­FES­SOR LIM POH LIAN,</p>
    <p>di­rec­tor of the high-level iso­la­tion unit at the National Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases and mem­ber of the ex­pert com­mit­tee on Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion ap­pointed by the Min­istry of Health.</p>
    <p>THE RIGHT IN­FOR­MA­TION</p>
    <p>At the end of the day, the de­ci­sion to vac­ci­nate or not rests with the per­son, not with some­one forc­ing him to do what he doesn’t want. But that de­ci­sion should be made based on in­for­ma­tion, rather than mis­in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>PRO­FES­SOR OOI ENG EONG, an ex­pert in emerg­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases at Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School and co-de­vel­oper of a Covid-19 vac­cine in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>SE­CUR­ING THE COLD CHAIN</p>
    <p>En­sur­ing that the cold chain is not com­pro­mised is a very crit­i­cal part of the dis­tri­bu­tion lo­gis­tics sup­ply chain process... There are very clear checks and bal­ances along the way to en­sure that there is no com­pro­mise on the stor­age con­di­tions along­side trans­porta­tion con­di­tions from the point that it (the vac­cine) leaves the man­u­fac­tur­ing plant to the point it gets to the health­care provider’s of­fice.</p>
