    <p>GUWA­HATI • Nearly four mil­lion peo­ple i n In­dia’s north-eastern state of As­sam and neigh­bour­ing Nepal have been dis­placed by heavy flood­ing from mon­soon rain, with dozens miss­ing as deaths rose to at least 189, gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The over­flow­ing Brahmaputr­a River, which flows through China’s Ti­bet, In­dia and Bangladesh, has dam­aged crops and trig­gered mud­slides, dis­plac­ing mil­lions of peo­ple, of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>More than 2.75 mil­lion peo­ple in As­sam have been dis­placed by three waves of floods since late May that have claimed 79 lives after two more deaths were re­ported overnight, a state gov­ern­ment of­fi­cial said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“The flood sit­u­a­tion re­mains crit­i­cal with most of the rivers flow­ing men­ac­ingly above the dan­ger mark,” As­sam Wa­ter Re­sources Min­is­ter Ke­shab Ma­hanta said.</p>
    <p>In neigh­bour­ing Nepal, mean­while, the gov­ern­ment asked res­i­dents along its south­ern plains yes­ter­day to re­main alert as heavy mon­soon rain was ex­pected to pound the Hi­malayan na­tion where more than 100 have died in floods and land­slides since last month, of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>Some 110 peo­ple were killed and an­other 100 in­jured as land­slides and flash floods washed or swept away homes, up­ended roads and bridges, and dis­placed hun­dreds of oth­ers in 26 of the coun­try’s 77 dis­tricts, po­lice said.</p>
    <p>Home Min­istry of­fi­cial Mu­rari Wasti said the death toll was ex­pected to rise, with 48 peo­ple still miss­ing.</p>
    <p>“Search and res­cue teams are look­ing for those who are miss­ing in dif­fer­ent places but chances of find­ing them alive are slim,” Mr Wasti told Reuters.</p>
    <p>Mr Barun Paudel of the weather fore­cast­ing of­fice in the cap­i­tal, Kath­mandu, said heavy rain was ex­pected to pound much of the mainly moun­tain­ous na­tion in the next four days. “We have urged res­i­dents to re­main alert against pos­si­ble land­slides and floods,” he said.</p>
    <p>Land­slides and flash floods are com­mon in Nepal and In­dian states, in­clud­ing As­sam and Bi­har, dur­ing the June to Septem­ber an­nual rainy sea­son.</p>
