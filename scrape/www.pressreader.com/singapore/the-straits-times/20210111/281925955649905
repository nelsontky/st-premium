    <p>In the end, two bil­lion­aires from Cal­i­for­nia did what le­gions of politi­cians, pros­e­cu­tors and power bro­kers had tried and failed to do for years: They pulled the plug on Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter’s de­ci­sion to per­ma­nently sus­pend Mr Trump’s ac­count on Fri­day “due to the risk of fur­ther in­cite­ment of vi­o­lence”, after a de­ci­sion a day ear­lier by Face­book to ban the Pres­i­dent at least to the end of his term, was a wa­ter­shed mo­ment in the his­tory of so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Both com­pa­nies had spent years de­fend­ing Mr Trump’s con­tin­ued pres­ence on their plat­forms, only to change course days be­fore the end of his pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>Why these com­pa­nies’ chief ex­ec­u­tives – Mr Jack Dorsey of Twit­ter and Mr Mark Zucker­berg of Face­book – de­cided to act now is no mys­tery. They have been un­der pres­sure for years to hold Mr Trump ac­count­able, and that pres­sure in­ten­si­fied enor­mously this past week, as ev­ery­one from Ms Michelle Obama to the com­pa­nies’ own em­ploy­ees called for a per­ma­nent ban in the wake of Wed­nes­day’s deadly Capi­tol riot.</p>
    <p>These com­pa­nies, cor­po­rate au­toc­ra­cies mas­querad­ing as mini-democ­ra­cies, of­ten por­tray their mod­er­a­tion de­ci­sions as the re­sults of a kind of for­mu­laic due process, as if “don’t in­cite an in­sur­rec­tion­ist mob” had been in the com­mu­nity guide­lines all along.</p>
    <p>But high-stakes calls like these typ­i­cally come down to gut de­ci­sions made un­der ex­treme duress. In this case, Mr Dorsey and Mr Zucker­berg con­sid­ered the ev­i­dence, con­sulted their teams, weighed the trade-offs and risks of in­ac­tion – in­clud­ing the threat of a worker re­volt that could dam­age their abil­ity to at­tract top tal­ent – and de­cided that they’d seen enough.</p>
    <p>Jour­nal­ists and his­to­ri­ans will spend years un­pack­ing the im­pro­vi­sa­tional na­ture of these bans, and scru­ti­n­is­ing why they ar­rived just as Mr Trump was los­ing his power and Democrats were poised to take con­trol of Congress and the White House.</p>
    <p>The bans have also turned up the heat on a free-speech de­bate that has been sim­mer­ing for years. On Fri­day night, pro-Trump Repub­li­cans raged, claim­ing Twit­ter’s move was an ex­am­ple of Sil­i­con Val­ley’s tyran­ni­cal speech con­trols.</p>
    <p>THE SHAPERS OF PUBLIC DIS­COURSE</p>
    <p>And while many lib­er­als cheered Twit­ter’s de­ci­sion as an over­due and ap­pro­pri­ate step to pre­vent more vi­o­lence, some also cringed at the thought of so much con­trol rest­ing in so few hands. “We un­der­stand the de­sire to per­ma­nently sus­pend him now,” Ms Kate Ruane, a lawyer for the Amer­i­can Civil Lib­er­ties Union, wrote in a state­ment on Fri­day. “But it should con­cern ev­ery­one when com­pa­nies like Face­book and Twit­ter wield the unchecked power to re­move peo­ple from plat­forms that have be­come in­dis­pens­able for the speech of bil­lions – es­pe­cially when po­lit­i­cal re­al­i­ties make those de­ci­sions eas­ier.”</p>
    <p>Above all, Mr Trump’s muz­zling pro­vides a clar­i­fy­ing les­son in where power re­sides in our dig­i­tal so­ci­ety – not just in the prece­dent of law or the checks and bal­ances of gov­ern­ment, but in the abil­ity to deny ac­cess to the plat­forms that shape our public dis­course.</p>
    <p>Mr Dorsey’s and Mr Zucker­berg’s names have never ap­peared on a bal­lot. But they have a kind of au­thor­ity that no elected of­fi­cial on earth can claim.</p>
    <p>This power ap­pears mostly in sub­tle and un­spo­ken ways – like the eerily calm, hostage-like video Mr Trump filmed on Thurs­day, hours after Twit­ter and Face­book threat­ened to delete his ac­counts.</p>
    <p>In the video, he con­ceded that he had lost the elec­tion and con­demned the Capi­tol at­tack, two things he had stub­bornly re­fused to do even as Congress talked of im­peach­ing him a sec­ond time and his own Cabi­net mem­bers dis­cussed in­vok­ing the 25th Amend­ment to re­move him from of­fice.</p>
    <p>Le­gal and po­lit­i­cal con­cerns cer­tainly pres­sured the Pres­i­dent to adopt a more con­cil­ia­tory stance. But there was an­other in­ter­pre­ta­tion of his change of heart: Mr Trump would rather lose his pres­i­dency than his post­ing priv­i­leges.</p>
    <p>In some ways, the Pres­i­dent – who used to boast that the plat­forms “would never” ban him – would be cor­rect to make his so­cial me­dia ac­counts a pri­or­ity over his re­main­ing days in of­fice.</p>
    <p>A suc­cess­ful im­peach­ment would be an em­bar­rass­ing end to his po­lit­i­cal ca­reer. But los­ing his huge on­line fol­low­ing – 88 mil­lion fol­low­ers on Twit­ter, and 35 mil­lion on Face­book – would de­prive him of cul­tural in­flu­ence long into the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>It takes away the priv­i­lege he seems to covet most: the abil­ity to com­man­deer the world’s at­ten­tion with the push of a but­ton.</p>
    <p>LIM­I­TA­TIONS OF ALT-PLAT­FORMS</p>
    <p>Mr Trump is no or­di­nary in­mate in Twit­ter jail. Un­like other de-plat­formed par­ti­sans, he has a huge right-wing me­dia ap­pa­ra­tus that will fol­low him wher­ever he goes, and le­gions of fol­low­ers who will am­plify what he says, no mat­ter where he says it.</p>
    <p>His fol­low­ers have pledged to de­camp to so-called “alt-plat­forms” like Gab and Par­ler, which have less strin­gent rules. But these apps are tiny by com­par­i­son and, be­cause they are largely un­mod­er­ated, of­ten amount to last-re­sort echo cham­bers for nox­ious ex­trem­ists. If none of the alt-plat­forms suf­fices, Mr Trump may well start his own so­cial net­work, one where he can post with aban­don. And if all else fails, he can al­ways call into Fox News.</p>
    <p>But re­build­ing a huge au­di­ence on a new plat­form is no sim­ple thing, even for a for­mer pres­i­dent, and these alt-plat­forms face their own le­gal and tech­ni­cal bat­tles. Par­ler it­self suf­fered a ma­jor blow on Satur­day when Ap­ple joined Google in block­ing it from their app stores, cit­ing the app’s lax mod­er­a­tion poli­cies.</p>
    <p>No mat­ter where he ends up post­ing, it’s doubt­ful that Mr Trump will ever have what he had in Face­book and Twit­ter – a fric­tion­less soap­box, where he could joust with his en­e­mies as well as bask in the ado­ra­tion of his fans, and a di­rect line to ev­ery news­room in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>In some ways, Mr Trump’s so­cial me­dia dom­i­nance was an ac­ci­dent of his­tory. In 2009, when he first joined Twit­ter, he was a re­al­ity TV star look­ing for at­ten­tion, and Twit­ter was a fledg­ling so­cial net­work that needed high-pro­file celebritie­s to at­tract growth. It was a per­fect match, and he soon be­gan hon­ing the free­wheel­ing, stream-of-con­scious­ness style that would be­come his sig­na­ture.</p>
    <p>For years, he used the plat­form to weigh in on ev­ery­thing from wind tur­bines (ugly) to pres­i­dent Barack Obama’s birth cer­tifi­cate (fake) to writer-pro­ducer Jon Ste­wart’s com­edy (over­rated). Mr Trump’s fil­ter-free mus­ings turned out to be en­gage­ment gold for Twit­ter, which rec­om­mended his tweets to mil­lions of new users through its al­go­rithms.</p>
    <p>So­cial me­dia be­came an even more pow­er­ful as­set for him when he turned to pol­i­tics. And after he got elected pres­i­dent, thanks in large part to his dom­i­nance on Twit­ter and Face­book, he used his ac­counts in ways no world leader ever had: to an­nounce ma­jor poli­cies, bully for­eign gov­ern­ments, whip up votes in Congress, hire and fire se­nior of­fi­cials, and in­ter­act with a mot­ley crew of racists and cranks.</p>
    <p>In time, we learnt that the ver­sion of Trump we saw on our feeds was, in many ways, more real than the flesh-and-blood hu­man who oc­cu­pied the Oval Of­fice. Peo­ple who wanted to know what Mr Trump ac­tu­ally thought about kneel­ing NFL play­ers or House Speaker Nancy Pelosi didn’t watch him read a pre­pared speech or hold a news con­fer­ence. They looked to @re­alDon­aldTrump, the most hon­est rep­re­sen­ta­tion of who he was.</p>
    <p>The most pre­dictable re­sult of Mr Trump’s dis­missal from</p>
    <p>Twit­ter – and, most likely, a sim­i­lar ban he’ll face from Face­book after In­au­gu­ra­tion Day – is that it will be­come a ral­ly­ing cry for con­ser­va­tives who see them­selves as vic­tims of Sil­i­con Val­ley cen­sor­ship.</p>
    <p>“We are liv­ing Or­well’s 1984,” the Pres­i­dent’s son Don­ald Trump Jr fumed on his (still op­er­a­tional, 6.5 mil­lion-fol­lower) Twit­ter ac­count. “Free-speech no longer ex­ists in Amer­ica. It died with big tech.”</p>
    <p>No se­ri­ous thinker be­lieves that Twit­ter and Face­book, as pri­vate com­pa­nies, are ob­li­gated to give any user a plat­form, just as no one doubts that a restau­rant owner can boot an un­ruly diner for caus­ing a scene.</p>
    <p>But there are le­git­i­mate ques­tions about whether a small hand­ful of un­elected tech ex­ec­u­tives, ac­count­able only to their boards and share­hold­ers (and, in Mr Zucker­berg’s case, to nei­ther) should wield such enor­mous power.</p>
    <p>These ac­tions also raise longer-term ques­tions, such as whether the busi­ness mod­els of so­cial me­dia com­pa­nies are fun­da­men­tally com­pat­i­ble with a healthy democ­racy, or whether a gen­er­a­tion of Twit­ter-ad­dicted politi­cians can ever be un­taught the les­son that rack­ing up retweets is a surer path to power than gov­ern­ing re­spon­si­bly.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s ban will have tan­gi­ble ef­fects on the spread of dis­in­for­ma­tion about the 2020 elec­tion, much of which orig­i­nated on his ac­counts.</p>
    <p>SPLIN­TER­ING OF AMER­I­CAN IN­TER­NET</p>
    <p>It will also prob­a­bly ac­cel­er­ate the splin­ter­ing of the Amer­i­can In­ter­net along par­ti­san lines, a process that was al­ready un­der way, and in­ten­sify calls on the right for the re­peal of Sec­tion 230 of the Com­mu­ni­ca­tions De­cency Act, which shields so­cial me­dia com­pa­nies from le­gal li­a­bil­ity for their users’ posts.</p>
    <p>In the short term, peo­ple wor­ried about a slip­pery slope of cen­sor­ship on Twit­ter and Face­book can take some com­fort in the fact that Mr Dorsey and Mr Zucker­berg ap­pear to hate play­ing the role of speech po­lice, and avoid do­ing it when­ever pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>For them, Mr Trump’s case is un­like any other – a celebrity who rode their plat­forms to the pres­i­dency, then used them to stage an at­tack on Amer­i­can democ­racy it­self – and their de­ci­sions to ban him aren’t likely to set much of a prece­dent.</p>
    <p>But that will be cold com­fort to Mr Trump, who now finds him­self on the wrong side of the bright line these com­pa­nies have drawn. The Pres­i­dent railed against Twit­ter’s ban on Fri­day night, re­leas­ing a fiery state­ment through the White House press of­fice that claimed, “We will not be SILENCED!” But in the ways that mat­ter most to him, he al­ready had been.</p>
