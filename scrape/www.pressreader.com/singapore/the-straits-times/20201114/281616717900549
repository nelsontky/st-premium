    <p>• China yes­ter­day con­grat­u­lated US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den, who won the Nov 3 election that Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has not con­ceded, nearly a week af­ter the for­mer vice-pres­i­dent clinched enough states for the win.</p>
    <p>“We re­spect the choice of the Amer­i­can peo­ple. We ex­tend con­grat­u­la­tions to Mr Bi­den and Ms Har­ris,” Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin said at a reg­u­lar daily brief­ing, re­fer­ring to Vice-Pres­i­dent-elect Ka­mala Har­ris.</p>
    <p>“We un­der­stand the re­sults of the US election will be de­ter­mined ac­cord­ing to US laws and pro­ce­dures,” he added, re­peat­ing Bei­jing’s ear­lier stance.</p>
    <p>China was pre­vi­ously among a hand­ful of coun­tries, in­clud­ing Russia and Mex­ico, that had not con­grat­u­lated the Pres­i­dent-elect, with Bei­jing com­ment­ing ear­lier this week that it had “no­ticed Mr Bi­den de­clared he is the win­ner”.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, who leads by more than five mil­lion in the pop­u­lar vote, ce­mented his vic­tory late on Thurs­day by win­ning Ari­zona, US net­works said.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s four years in the White House have been marked by soar­ing ten­sions as he por­trayed China as the great­est threat to the United States and global democ­racy, and the two sides sparred over top­ics from blame for the Covid-19 pan­demic to tech­nol­ogy to China’s hu­man rights record.</p>
    <p>In 2016, Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping sent con­grat­u­la­tions to Mr Trump on Nov 9, a day af­ter the election.</p>
    <p>It is, how­ever, far from cer­tain that US-China re­la­tions will im­prove un­der a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion, with Mr Bi­den, dur­ing a Demo­cratic Party pri­mary de­bate in Fe­bru­ary, call­ing Mr Xi a “thug”.</p>
    <p>For­mer Chi­nese fi­nance min­is­ter Lou Ji­wei said yes­ter­day that trade fric­tions be­tween the two coun­tries may not ease soon.</p>
    <p>When asked about the out­look for the US-China eco­nomic and trade re­la­tion­ship at the Caixin Sum­mit in Bei­jing, he said: “Even if Mr Bi­den is elected, the US sup­pres­sion of China will be in­evitable.”</p>
