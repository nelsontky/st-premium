    <p>Five men aged be­tween 21 and 40 have been ar­rested af­ter a ri­ot­ing in­ci­dent in Clarke Quay on Satur­day night that in­volved a deadly weapon.</p>
    <p>The brawlers had fled the scene in Eu Tong Sen Street by the time the po­lice ar­rived af­ter be­ing alerted at about 10.40pm, while mem­bers of the pub­lic were help­ing two in­jured peo­ple. The Straits Times un­der­stands that a flick knife was the weapon used in the fight.</p>
    <p>A 27-year-old woman and a 36-year-old man at the scene were con­scious when taken to the Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hospi­tal (SGH). A 29-year-old man was ar­rested for dis­or­derly be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>A 40-year-old man sus­pected of be­ing in­volved in the fight was found hid­ing in a dark cor­ner of a back al­ley near Car­pen­ter Street. He was ar­rested and taken to SGH to have his in­juries treated.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions by of­fi­cers from the Cen­tral Po­lice Di­vi­sion and Crim­i­nal In­ves­ti­ga­tion Depart­ment, as well as closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion footage, helped iden­tify some oth­ers in­volved in the brawl.</p>
    <p>“Four men, aged be­tween 21 and 34, were ar­rested within 16 hours fol­low­ing the in­ci­dent. A man­hunt is un­der way to ar­rest the other sus­pects in­volved,” said the po­lice in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Pre­lim­i­nary in­ves­ti­ga­tions found that the fight erupted af­ter a dis­pute in a nearby restau­rant.</p>
    <p>The po­lice are still in­ves­ti­gat­ing the case.</p>
    <p>A video up­loaded by Face­book user Navin Ku­mar, which has gar­nered more than 80,000 views, shows sev­eral peo­ple shov­ing each other out­side The Cen­tral mall in Clarke Quay. A woman can be heard scream­ing as sev­eral men, in­clud­ing one who had taken his shirt off, fight each other on the walkway lead­ing to­wards an un­der­pass out­side the mall.</p>
    <p>The video then cuts to the point when the po­lice have ar­rived. Of­fi­cers can be seen us­ing torches and break­ing up an­other scuf­fle be­tween two men on the foot­path in front of the mall.</p>
    <p>Near the end of the three-minute video, blood is seen splat­tered on the wall and floor of the walkway as paramedics tend to a man ly­ing down, as well as a woman who is seated on the side of the path.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said they will not tol­er­ate “such brazen acts of vi­o­lence and bla­tant dis­re­gard of the law” and “will spare no ef­fort to ap­pre­hend such of­fend­ers and deal with them in ac­cor­dance with the law”.</p>
    <p>Of­fend­ers con­victed of ri­ot­ing while armed with a deadly weapon can be jailed for up to 10 years and caned.</p>
