    <p>If Mr Joe Bi­den is elected pres­i­dent, his top for­eign pol­icy chal­lenge will be China – but not the China that he dealt with un­der Mr Barack Obama. It will be a much more ag­gres­sive China, a China look­ing to sup­plant Amer­i­can tech­nol­ogy dom­i­nance, smother democ­racy in Hong Kong and cy­ber­steal your per­sonal data.</p>
    <p>Push­ing back on that China, without blow­ing up the global trad­ing sys­tem, will re­quire re­vers­ing one of US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s big­gest mis­takes – his fail­ure to build a part­ner­ship with Ger­many to counter Bei­jing. Yes, you read that right.</p>
    <p>The Cold War with the Soviet Union was fought and won in Ber­lin. And the loom­ing Cold War with China – over trade, tech­nol­ogy and global in­flu­ence – will be fought and won in Ber­lin. As Ber­lin goes, so goes Ger­many, and as Ger­many goes, so goes the Euro­pean Union, the world’s big­gest sin­gle mar­ket.</p>
    <p>And which­ever coun­try – the United States or China – is able to lever­age the EU on its side in the com­pe­ti­tion for whose tech­nol­ogy stan­dards, trade rules and tech­nol­ogy will pre­vail will set the rules for global dig­i­tal com­merce in the 21st cen­tury.</p>
    <p>“The rea­son that the United States was on the win­ning side of the three great con­flicts of the 20th cen­tury – World War I, World War II and the Cold War – is that we were part of the strong­est coali­tion,” said Dr Michael Man­del­baum, au­thor of The Rise And Fall Of Peace On Earth.</p>
    <p>“The World War I coali­tion we joined be­lat­edly. The World War II coali­tion we joined less be­lat­edly. The Cold War coali­tion to de­feat the Soviet Union, we or­gan­ised. This should have been the model for deal­ing with China.”</p>
    <p>If we make this a story of Amer­ica act­ing against China alone – with the goal of mak­ing Amer­ica, and only Amer­ica, great again – Amer­ica loses.</p>
    <p>If we make this a story of the world ver­sus China on what are the right and fair rules of 21st-cen­tury com­merce – we can bend Bei­jing our way.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump had to im­pose bil­lions of dol­lars in taxes on US im­ports from China – and force US farm­ers to live with China’s re­tal­i­a­tion of cur­tailed Amer­i­can agricultur­e pur­chases – just to com­pel China to prom­ise to buy more US goods. But he still did not se­cure a sus­tained open­ing of China’s econ­omy for truly re­cip­ro­cal com­merce.</p>
    <p>As The New York Times re­ported on Tues­day, “since sign­ing the deal, China has taken steps to open its mar­kets to Amer­i­can banks and farm­ers, but its pur­chases of Amer­i­can prod­ucts are far be­hind” – more than 50 per cent – “its prom­ise to buy an ad­di­tional US$200 bil­lion (S$274 bil­lion) by the end of next year”.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has been tougher on China than any pre­vi­ous pres­i­dent, and rightly so in my view. As a friend of mine who does busi­ness in China likes to say: Mr Trump is not the Amer­i­can pres­i­dent Amer­ica de­serves, but he is the Amer­i­can pres­i­dent China de­serves.</p>
    <p>But I pre­fer not to use the term “China”. I pre­fer “1.3 bil­lion peo­ple who speak Chi­nese”. Be­cause the be­hav­iour of those 1.3 bil­lion Chi­nese speak­ers, whose econ­omy is grow­ing very dy­nam­i­cally, is not eas­ily mod­i­fied by 328 mil­lion Amer­i­cans op­er­at­ing on Mr Trump’s Amer­ica-First-Amer­ica-Alone strat­egy.</p>
    <p>This is why I thought it was a huge mis­take for Mr Trump to be si­mul­ta­ne­ously ham­mer­ing China and bash­ing Ger­many over EU car tar­iffs and Ber­lin’s lag­ging mil­i­tary spend­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump should have pri­ori­tised a part­ner­ship with Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel of Ger­many – also known as “the Chan­cel­lor of Europe” – who is as con­cerned about China’s bul­ly­ing as Amer­i­cans are.</p>
    <p>Ger­many has a small army that would be use­less in a shoot­ing war against Rus­sia, but it is a man­u­fac­tur­ing su­per­power that would be a de­ci­sive ally in a trade war against China. “We share your griev­ances with China, but why has Trump never tried to ad­dress them with your Euro­pean al­lies?” a vet­eran Ger­man diplo­mat asked me.</p>
    <p>Now Mr Trump is also pun­ish­ing Ger­many by bring­ing home some of the US troops there.</p>
    <p>The re­sult? Pew Re­search re­ported in May that Ger­mans last year pri­ori­tised their coun­try’s re­la­tion­ship with the US over that with China – 50 per cent to 24 per cent. To­day, 37 per cent of Ger­mans pri­ori­tise their coun­try’s re­la­tion­ship with the US and 36 per cent pri­ori­tise re­la­tions with China.</p>
    <p>So, do the maths: On tak­ing of­fice, Mr Trump tore up the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship agree­ment, which set the rules for free trade in the 21st cen­tury in line with US in­ter­ests and was sup­ported by the 12 big­gest Pa­cific economies – ex­clud­ing China. And now he’s weak­en­ing ties with Ger­many. Then, in the mid­dle of all of this, Mr Trump’s sec­re­tary of state, Mr Mike Pom­peo, gave a speech declar­ing that “se­cur­ing our free­doms from the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party is the mis­sion of our time”, there­fore it is also time “for a new group­ing of like-minded na­tions, a new al­liance of democ­ra­cies” to de­ter China.</p>
    <p>“If the free world doesn’t change,” Mr Pom­peo went on, “com­mu­nist China will surely change us.”</p>
    <p>That speech left me speech­less. It’s hard to have an al­liance without al­lies. If man­ag­ing com­mu­nist China is, truly, “the mis­sion of our time”, then wouldn’t you set aside nickel-and-dime com­plaints about Ger­man de­fence spend­ing aimed at Rus­sia – a third-rate power best known for sell­ing vodka, caviar and oil and gas – to en­list the whole EU on our side?</p>
    <p>It is true that the EU coun­tries are wary of get­ting caught in the cross­fire be­tween Wash­ing­ton and Bei­jing – or of hav­ing to choose be­tween an Amer­i­can or a Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy ecosys­tem. Nev­er­the­less, the EU last year la­belled China a “sys­temic ri­val” – much to the cha­grin of the Chi­nese, who are cur­rently try­ing to di­vide and buy off Eastern Europe from its Western brethren.</p>
    <p>The thing China fears most is the one thing Mr Trump re­fused to build – a united coali­tion that in­cludes the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship, the US and the EU, built around Wash­ing­ton and Ber­lin.</p>
    <p>Economist Tyler Cowen put it well on Bloomberg View the other day: The Trump China hawks “were right about ev­ery­thing, ex­cept how to deal with China”. The great grand strat­egy chess move of the 1970s was Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger build­ing an al­liance be­tween China and Amer­ica to con­tain the Soviet Union. The great grand strat­egy chess move to­day is build­ing an al­liance be­tween the US and Ger­many to coun­ter­bal­ance China.</p>
