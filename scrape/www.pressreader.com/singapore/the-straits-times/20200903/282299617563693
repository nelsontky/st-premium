    <p>Busi­nesses are con­cerned about what hap­pens when gov­ern­ment sup­port dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic ta­pers off, but they are also us­ing this time to ex­plore op­por­tu­ni­ties, said Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>She added that firms are also com­mit­ted to cre­at­ing an in­clu­sive work­force that is bal­anced and has a Sin­ga­porean core.</p>
    <p>Madam Hal­imah was speak­ing to re­porters af­ter a closed-door di­a­logue with about 20 mem­bers of the Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Cham­ber of Com­merce and In­dus­try (SCCCI).</p>
    <p>The ses­sion, held dur­ing a busi­ness meet­ing for SCCCI coun­cil mem­bers, was mod­er­ated by SCCCI vice-pres­i­dent Charles Ho.</p>
    <p>Madam Hal­imah said that based on dis­cus­sions and feed­back dur­ing the di­a­logue, com­pa­nies are con­cerned about how long gov­ern­ment sup­port will con­tinue, and “what hap­pens af­ter the sup­port is no longer there”. “They’re aware of the fact that this can­not go on for­ever, but they also are con­cerned about how that will im­pact them – whether there will be re­cov­ery in time for them to be able to con­tinue with their busi­ness,” she said.</p>
    <p>But she added that they are also ex­plor­ing new op­por­tu­ni­ties, such as go­ing on­line and reach­ing new mar­kets, es­pe­cially with gov­ern­ment schemes that help them ac­cess dig­i­tal tools and set up e-com­merce plat­forms.</p>
    <p>“They’re be­ing con­nected to op­por­tu­ni­ties over­seas with­out hav­ing a phys­i­cal pres­ence there, and that’s im­por­tant,” she said.</p>
    <p>Madam Hal­imah pointed to Mer­lin Gold­smith, a tra­di­tional jew­ellery shop that has seen its on­line sales grow dur­ing this pe­riod.</p>
    <p>She said firms “want to ex­plore new op­por­tu­ni­ties and ar­eas of growth, like our bio­med­i­cal sec­tor, our dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion that pro­vides op­por­tu­ni­ties, and also sus­tain­abil­ity”.</p>
    <p>“Our green econ­omy, which deals with waste man­age­ment and is a</p>
    <p>CON­CERNED</p>
    <p>very im­por­tant thing... as well as fin­tech ser­vices, are growth ar­eas which they know are very im­por­tant and will cre­ate good jobs,” she said.</p>
    <p>The com­pa­nies are also fully com­mit­ted to cre­at­ing an in­clu­sive work­force, while sup­port­ing the ini­tia­tive to have a Sin­ga­porean core, Madam Hal­imah noted.</p>
    <p>“But at the same time, they also said that be­cause of the na­ture of their busi­nesses, a bal­ance is im­por­tant for them,” she said.</p>
    <p>“So I told them that get­ting the right bal­ance is al­ways not an easy thing to do and is some­thing that has to con­tinue to be looked at and re­viewed. But they are com­mit­ted to cre­at­ing a Sin­ga­porean core, that I think is im­por­tant. With reskilling and up­skilling, they are also aware of the nu­mer­ous ini­tia­tives that are on­go­ing and how they can make use of those.”</p>
    <p>SCCCI pres­i­dent Roland Ng agreed that bal­ance in hav­ing both Sin­ga­pore­ans and for­eign tal­ent in the work­force is im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>He said com­pa­nies would like to hire Sin­ga­porean staff, but work­ers should also do their part by up­skilling them­selves.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore­ans can take this down­time to... up­grade their skills so that when busi­nesses come back, they can em­ploy them.”</p>
    <p>They’re aware of the fact that this can­not go on for­ever, but they also are con­cerned about how that will im­pact them – whether there will be re­cov­ery in time for them to be able to con­tinue with their busi­ness.</p>
