    <p>WASHINGTON • Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump raised US$165 mil­lion (S$226 mil­lion) in July for his re-elec­tion cam­paign and shared com­mit­tees with the Repub­li­can Na­tional Com­mit­tee (RNC), out­pac­ing his ri­val Joe Bi­den, who raised US$140 mil­lion last month as a record-set­ting pace of money con­tin­ued to flood into the pres­i­den­tial cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, the pre­sump­tive Demo­cratic nom­i­nee, had out­raised Mr Trump in the two pre­vi­ous months, the first time that he had out­raised the Repub­li­can in­cum­bent.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den raised US$141 mil­lion in his shared ac­counts with the Demo­cratic Na­tional Com­mit­tee in June, com­pared with US$131 mil­lion for Mr Trump with the RNC.</p>
    <p>The sums for both par­ties are far higher than for the cam­paigns four years ago, when Mrs Hil­lary Clin­ton raised US$89 mil­lion with the Demo­cratic Party in July and Mr Trump col­lected US$80 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Both cam­paigns an­nounced their du­elling July fig­ures late on Wed­nes­day, with Mr Bi­den’s cam­paign go­ing first and Mr Trump’s fol­low­ing soon af­ter.</p>
    <p>“Silent Ma­jor­ity Donors”, wrote Mr Gary Coby, Mr Trump’s dig­i­tal direc­tor, on Twit­ter, sur­round­ing the phrase with four Amer­i­can flag emo­jis.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s cam­paign team cheered how much of its haul it saved for the com­ing weeks be­fore the Nov 3 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“The Bi­den cam­paign is on the march, build­ing off the in­cred­i­ble mo­men­tum from this sum­mer with an­other lights-out fundrais­ing month, bank­ing an­other US$50 mil­lion for the fi­nal stretch to elec­tion day,” cam­paign man­ager Jen­nifer O’Mal­ley Dil­lon said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>She added that the cam­paign and party en­tered Au­gust with US$294 mil­lion in the bank. Mr Trump’s cam­paign said it and the party had more than US$300 mil­lion cash on hand.</p>
    <p>“The en­thu­si­asm be­hind Pres­i­dent Trump’s re­elec­tion con­tin­ues to grow as July’s mas­sive fundrais­ing to­tals prove,” said Mr Bill Stepien, Mr Trump’s new cam­paign man­ager.</p>
    <p>The Trump cam­paign said that July was its big­gest on­line fundrais­ing month ever, as do­na­tions poured in even as Mr Trump trails Mr Bi­den in na­tional and key bat­tle­ground polls.</p>
