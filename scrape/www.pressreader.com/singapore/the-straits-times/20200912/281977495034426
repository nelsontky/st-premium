    <p>MOSCOW • Rus­sian po­lice have traced op­po­si­tion politi­cian Alexei Navalny’s move­ments and what he drank be­fore fall­ing ill in Siberia last month, and are try­ing to lo­cate a wit­ness who has left the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The in­te­rior min­istry yes­ter­day said it was pre­par­ing another re­quest for le­gal as­sis­tance from Ger­many, where Mr Navalny is hos­pi­talised af­ter be­ing air­lifted there fol­low­ing what Ber­lin says was a poi­son at­tack on him with Novi­chok, a nerve agent.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, the in­te­rior min­istry’s trans­port de­part­ment in Siberia said it wanted to send in­ves­ti­ga­tors to work along­side Ger­man col­leagues on the case, af­ter re­ports that Mr Navalny had emerged from a coma.</p>
    <p>“This re­quest will in­clude an ap­pli­ca­tion for the pos­si­ble pres­ence of Rus­sian in­ter­nal af­fairs in­ves­ti­ga­tors... and a Rus­sian spe­cial­ist when Ger­man col­leagues are con­duct­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tions with Navalny, doc­tors and ex­perts.”</p>
    <p>It also re­quested per­mis­sion to ask clar­i­fy­ing and more ques­tions.</p>
    <p>The re­quest ap­peared to have no chance of success, given that Ger­many says it has al­ready es­tab­lished the pres­ence of Novi­chok and de­manded ex­pla­na­tions from Moscow – a call strongly echoed by other Western coun­tries. Some Ger­man politi­cians have called for ad­di­tional sanc­tions against Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia has not opened a for­mal crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion and is stick­ing to its po­si­tion that it needs hard ev­i­dence from Ger­many that Mr Navalny was in­deed poi­soned.</p>
    <p>Trans­port po­lice in Tomsk had es­tab­lished a time­line of events lead­ing up to Mr Navalny fall­ing ill, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>It listed a ho­tel, restau­rant, flat and cof­fee shop that Mr Navalny had vis­ited, and said he had drunk wine and an al­co­holic cock­tail.</p>
    <p>In the days fol­low­ing Mr Navalny’s ill­ness, his spokesman strongly de­nied al­le­ga­tions that he had con­sumed al­co­hol.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said po­lice had in­ter­viewed five of the six peo­ple it said ac­com­pa­nied Mr Navalny on the jour­ney when he fell ill.</p>
    <p>It said it was look­ing for a sixth per­son it named as Ms Ma­rina Pevchikh, a Bri­tish res­i­dent who flew to Ger­many on Aug 22 and whose where­abouts it said were be­ing es­tab­lished.</p>
