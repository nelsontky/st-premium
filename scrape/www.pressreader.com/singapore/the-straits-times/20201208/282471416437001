    <p>In 2008, a teenage Gabriel Quak watched from the back of a ho­tel ball­room as Alek­san­dar Duric and Khairul Amri picked up the Player of the Year and Young Player of the Year awards re­spec­tively at the SLeague Awards.</p>
    <p>Then a player with the Young Li­ons, the 17-year-old dreamed of stand­ing on that same stage one day.</p>
    <p>Quak’s goal was ful­filled yes­ter­day at the Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore Awards Night when the Lion City Sailors for­ward was crowned Player of the Year at The Gym at Jalan Be­sar. He was re­warded for con­sis­tent per­for­mances this sea­son with five goals and eight as­sists in 14 games.</p>
    <p>The 29-year-old told The Straits Times: “It’s been a long jour­ney full of ups and downs. I was in the spot­light early on in my ca­reer be­cause I was a mi­nor­ity, and it was both phys­i­cally and men­tally drain­ing.</p>
    <p>“There were times when I won­dered if I was cut out for this, and I’m thank­ful for my family, coaches and team­mates for help­ing me to per­se­vere and grow stronger as a per­son.”</p>
    <p>While un­de­ni­ably ta­lented and fleet-footed, Quak did not al­ways get as much play­ing time as he would have liked. But af­ter play­ing for the Young Li­ons, Lion­sXII and Gey­lang In­ter­na­tional, a stint at Thai League 1 side Navy FC in 2018 ex­panded his hori­zons and helped him to be more fo­cused on his ca­reer.</p>
    <p>“I re­flected on what I wanted to achieve, and I told my­self I wanted to stamp my au­thor­ity and leave a mark in th­ese last six to seven years of my play­ing ca­reer,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I’m grate­ful for teams that give me free­dom to ex­press my­self and show what I can do, and I’m glad to achieve one of th­ese per­sonal tar­gets. My next goal must be to win the league.”</p>
    <p>The night saw a Sailors dou­ble as Sai­ful­lah Ak­bar was named Young Player of the Year, fol­low­ing a break­through sea­son with two goals in 11 games.</p>
    <p>The 21-year-old said: “My goal this sea­son was to be play­ing week in, week out, and I achieved that thanks to the help of coach Aure­lio Vid­mar and my team­mates.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t ex­pect to win this and it is a spe­cial feel­ing. Hope­fully, this is the start of some­thing greater and we can win the league, do well in the AFC Cup, and I can break into the na­tional team.”</p>
    <p>The Coach of the Year gong went to Keiji Shige­tomi, who led Al­birex Ni­igata to their fourth Sin­ga­pore Premier League (SPL) ti­tle in five years this term.</p>
    <p>Ac­knowl­edg­ing the work of the club’s play­ers and staff, as well as sup­port from spon­sors and fans, the 41-year-old said: “There is al­ways pres­sure to win at this club, but we took it game by game and won the league. We will take the same ap­proach next sea­son.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter the suc­cess­ful com­ple­tion of the 25th SPL sea­son in a coro­n­avirus-im­pacted year, out­stand­ing in­di­vid­u­als from the cam­paign were recog­nised across nine cat­e­gories at the awards. FAS Recog­ni­tion Awards were also given to eight in­di­vid­u­als, with na­tional captain Hariss Harun, who earned 100 in­ter­na­tional caps, and Tampines Rovers for­ward Jor­dan Webb, who reached 100 SPL goals since his de­but in 2010, lauded for their sport­ing ex­cel­lence.</p>
