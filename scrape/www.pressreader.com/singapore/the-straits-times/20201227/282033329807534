    <p>The de­ci­sion to add Sin­ga­pore’s hawker cul­ture to the Unesco Rep­re­sen­ta­tive List of the In­tan­gi­ble Cul­tural Her­itage of Hu­man­ity capped al­most three years of ef­fort by the Na­tional Her­itage Board, Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency and Fed­er­a­tion of Mer­chants’ As­so­ci­a­tions. There were rum­blings from some neigh­bours who groused that their food was better. But the Unesco in­scrip­tion is not sim­ply about the qual­ity of the food. In Asia, af­ford­able food is lumped un­der the catchall of street food, which is un­der­stand­able be­cause, in many coun­tries, hawk­ers ply their trade on the street. Sin­ga­pore’s hawker cul­ture may have orig­i­nated in a sim­i­lar way.</p>
    <p>But hawk­ers here have long since evolved, mov­ing into pur­pose-built cen­tres, go­ing from lais­sez faire to li­censed trade, all the while feed­ing gen­er­a­tions of Sin­ga­pore­ans. Early en­force­ment poli­cies and ur­ban plan­ning de­ci­sions have shaped lo­cal hawker cul­ture in un­ex­pected ways. Many Sin­ga­pore­ans have grown up with a hawker cen­tre within a stone’s throw, and the ex­pec­ta­tion that meals for less than $10 would be eas­ily avail­able and that food op­tions would span Chi­nese, In­dian and Malay. The cen­tral­ity of the hawker cen­tre to Sin­ga­pore’s tan­gi­ble ur­ban land­scape and in­tan­gi­ble food cul­ture is unique to this lit­tle red dot. Now that the dust has set­tled a lit­tle, it is time to take a hard look at sus­tain­ing this tra­di­tion. Part of Unesco’s re­quire­ment is for Sin­ga­pore to sub­mit a report ev­ery six years on what has been done to safe­guard this her­itage. This might prove the harder task. Hope­fully, Unesco’s recog­ni­tion will give a more de­ter­mined push to solve the mul­ti­ple chal­lenges hawk­ers face, from high costs to low prof­its. But ev­ery Sin­ga­porean has a part to play in sup­port­ing this liv­ing her­itage: visit hawker cen­tres more of­ten, clear trays and ac­cept small price in­creases. These are small but cru­cial ways to keep Sin­ga­pore’s hawk­ers go­ing.</p>
