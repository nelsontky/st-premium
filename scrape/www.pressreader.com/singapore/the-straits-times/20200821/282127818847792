    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has not blunted the wealth of Sin­ga­pore’s rich­est, even as it pro­pelled some ahead of oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Hot­pot chain Haidi­lao founder Zhang Yong topped the list again this year, adding US$5.2 bil­lion (S$7.1 bil­lion) to his net worth.</p>
    <p>His wife Shu Ping, who is co­founder and di­rec­tor of Haidi­lao In­ter­na­tional Hold­ing, has been listed to­gether with him this year.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple led the pack with a com­bined net worth of US$19 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Mr Li Xit­ing, co-founder and chair­man of Shen­zhen Min­dray Bio-Med­i­cal Elec­tron­ics, came in sec­ond with US$17.8 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>He is a new en­trant to the list, pro­pelled by his com­pany’s soar­ing share prices, which were due to a surge in de­mand for its ven­ti­la­tors amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Both Mr Li and Mr Zhang are nat­u­ralised Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>Ty­coon Goh Cheng Liang of Nip­pon Paint, tech mogul Ed­uardo Saverin and real es­tate sib­lings Robert and Philip Ng of Far East Or­ga­ni­za­tion took the third, fourth and fifth spots re­spec­tively in this year’s edi­tion of the Forbes Sin­ga­pore Rich List.</p>
    <p>The list, which ranks Sin­ga­pore’s 50 rich­est peo­ple, saw their col­lec­tive wealth rise by 28 per cent to</p>
    <p>US$167 bil­lion, from</p>
    <p>US$130 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh moved up one spot to No. 3 as his net worth in­creased to US$14.8 bil­lion from US$9.5 bil­lion last year.</p>
    <p>Face­book shares, which hit record highs dur­ing the pan­demic, boosted co-founder Saverin’s wealth to US$14 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The Ng broth­ers also saw their com­bined net worth in­crease by US$1.1 bil­lion to US$13.2 bil­lion. But the in­crease was not enough to ar­rest their drop from last year’s No. 2 to No. 5 this year.</p>
    <p>Mr For­rest Li, group chief ex­ec­u­tive and chair­man of gam­ing and ecom­merce firm Sea, broke into the ranks of the top 10 on Forbes’ list this year. He added US$5.53 bil­lion to his wealth to be at No. 7 with US$7.1 bil­lion. Sea is Sin­ga­pore’s most valu­able home-grown pub­lic com­pany.</p>
    <p>The for­tunes of some ty­coons, how­ever, have taken a hit be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Hote­liers saw their wealth fall as tourism stalled. For in­stance, Fra­grance Group CEO Koh Wee Meng saw his net worth fall from US$1.2 bil­lion last year to US$870 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Four ty­coons ex­ited the list this year, in­clud­ing Lim Oon Kuin, the man be­hind one of Sin­ga­pore’s largest oil traders, Hin Leong Trad­ing, after the com­pany filed for bank­ruptcy in April. last year’s</p>
