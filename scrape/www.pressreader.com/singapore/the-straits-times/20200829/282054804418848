    <p>I’ve been think­ing about the two fam­i­lies we’ve en­coun­tered over the past two weeks. The Bi­den fam­ily is emo­tion­ally open, ren­dered vul­ner­a­ble by tragedy and driven by a pow­er­ful de­sire to con­nect. The Trump fam­ily is emo­tion­ally closed, iso­lated by en­mity and driven by a pow­er­ful de­sire to dom­i­nate.</p>
    <p>Oc­ca­sion­ally this week, one of the fe­male mem­bers of the Trump fam­ily would strug­gle to stick her head above the muck of her fam­ily’s val­ues and dis­play some hu­man­ity. But Don­ald, Don Jr and Eric showed no such im­pulse. Trump fam­ily val­ues are mean world val­ues.</p>
    <p>Mean world syn­drome is a con­cept con­ceived in the 1970s by com­mu­ni­ca­tions pro­fes­sor Ge­orge Gerb­ner.</p>
    <p>His idea was that peo­ple who see re­lent­less vi­o­lence on tele­vi­sion be­gin to per­ceive the world as be­ing more dan­ger­ous than it re­ally is. By the 1990s, it was no longer vi­o­lent pro­gram­ming that drove mean world cul­ture, but re­al­ity tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>That’s an en­tire in­dus­try de­signed to give the im­pres­sion that hu­man be­ings are in­her­ently ma­nip­u­la­tive, self­ish and petty. If you grow up watch­ing those pro­grammes, or star­ring in them, nat­u­rally you be­lieve that other peo­ple are fun­da­men­tally un­trust­wor­thy.</p>
    <p>Th­ese days, mean world cul­ture is ev­ery­where. It’s a siege men­tal­ity. Men­ace is ev­ery­where.</p>
    <p>This week’s Repub­li­can con­ven­tion was a four-day cav­al­cade of mean world alarmism.</p>
    <p>Mean world thrives on fear and per­pet­u­ates it­self by ex­ag­ger­at­ing fear. Its rhetor­i­cal ploy is catas­trophis­ing and its tone is apoc­a­lyp­tic.</p>
    <p>The Democrats are not just wrong, many speak­ers as­serted this week, but they are also “sub­vert­ing our repub­lic”, abol­ish­ing the sub­urbs, de­stroy­ing Western civil­i­sa­tion and es­tab­lish­ing a Cas­tro-style com­mu­nist dic­ta­tor­ship.</p>
    <p>The Democrats, Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Matt Gaetz of Florida said, want to “dis­arm you, empty the pris­ons, lock you in your home and in­vite (crim­i­nal gang) MS-13 to live next door”.</p>
    <p>St Louis cou­ple Mark and Pa­tri­cia McCloskey are the team mas­cots of mean world. They see Black Lives Mat­ter pro­test­ers walk­ing past their man­sion and de­cide they’re in the mid­dle of a race war. They come out wav­ing their guns.</p>
    <p>The im­plicit ar­gu­ment of the Repub­li­can con­ven­tion was that Demo­cratic can­di­date</p>
    <p>Joe Bi­den is too old, or soft, or com­pas­sion­ate to sur­vive in mean world. He’ll cower be­fore ris­ing crime rates. He’ll get pushed around by the hard left. He’ll get swal­lowed in the mael­strom.</p>
    <p>“You won’t be safe in Joe Bi­den’s Amer­ica,” is how Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence put it. This is the Repub­li­cans’ strong­est ar­gu­ment, es­pe­cially if mur­der rates con­tinue to soar and if Port­land and Kenosha-style may­hem be­comes com­mon­place this au­tumn.</p>
    <p>Democrats have fool­ishly al­lowed them­selves to be por­trayed as the en­e­mies of polic­ing. There’s a lot of fear float­ing around Amer­ica right now, avail­able to be ex­ploited by some­one.</p>
    <p>But let’s also be clear about what the real threats are. In many ways, this election is about two ri­val ver­sions of threat per­cep­tion. It will be won by which­ever party more per­sua­sively iden­ti­fies what we should fear.</p>
    <p>Yes, there have been dis­grace­ful scenes of far-left phys­i­cal and ver­bal bru­tal­ity, which get mag­ni­fied on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>The far big­ger threat, how­ever, is that we have a Pres­i­dent too busy fight­ing a cul­ture war to re­spond to a pan­demic and an economic cri­sis, or even to per­form ba­sic gov­er­nance. What part of 180,000 coro­n­avirus deaths does Mr Don­ald Trump not un­der­stand?</p>
    <p>The larger threat is that we’re caught in a po­lar­i­sa­tion cas­cade. Mean world fa­nat­ics – on the left and right – are play­ing a mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial game.</p>
    <p>Trumpian chaos jus­ti­fies and mag­ni­fies the woke mobs on the left. Woke mobs mag­nify and jus­tify Trumpian au­thor­i­tar­i­an­ism on the right.</p>
    <p>The up­shot of the mean world war is the oblit­er­a­tion of nor­mal pol­i­tics, the hol­low­ing out of the cen­tre and the degra­da­tion of pub­lic mo­ral­ity.</p>
    <p>Un­der the cover of this souped-up, screw-or-be-screwed men­tal­ity, norms are evis­cer­ated, truth is mas­sa­cred, big­otry is jus­ti­fied and pol­i­tics turns into a strug­gle to cul­tur­ally oblit­er­ate the other side.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den is go­ing to have to take on this wide­spread anx­i­ety about per­sonal safety by in­sist­ing that the real source of dan­ger is Mr Trump’s chaotic in­com­pe­tence and that the Pres­i­dent’s mean world ex­trem­ism is cor­ro­sive to the so­cial or­der. When the so­cial or­der dis­solves, peo­ple suf­fer.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den could point out that dis­or­der from left and right will only ac­cel­er­ate so long as</p>
    <p>Mr Trump is in the White House. He could make clear that compassion is not weak­ness, that the tough­est thing is to stand in a hail­storm of ha­tred and in­sist on kind­ness and con­sid­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>In a civilised so­ci­ety, law and or­der is not es­tab­lished with a bul­ly­ing jack­boot.</p>
    <p>Law and or­der is es­tab­lished through the calm, reg­u­lar enforcemen­t of de­cency, so peo­ple across so­ci­ety be­have like sta­ble, hon­ourable hu­man be­ings.</p>
