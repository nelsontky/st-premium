    <p>As the pace of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion picks up, there must also be a con­certed push across so­ci­ety to com­bat the neg­a­tive ef­fects of the dig­i­tal rev­o­lu­tion, Min­is­ter of State in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice Tan Kiat How said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>To co­or­di­nate this na­tional ef­fort, the Govern­ment should set up a new agency re­spon­si­ble for pre­vent­ing on­line harm such as cy­ber scams, while bring­ing to­gether com­mu­nity part­ners and ex­perts to con­tend with this com­plex prob­lem.</p>
    <p>At the same time, firms in the dig­i­tal sec­tor should pri­ori­tise the se­cu­rity of cus­tomer in­for­ma­tion, and be proac­tive in de­tect­ing bad ac­tors, said Mr Tan, who is also Min­is­ter of State for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said in Par­lia­ment that no one min­istry to­day is re­spon­si­ble for this is­sue; in­stead, dif­fer­ent agen­cies deal with as­pects such as dig­i­tal lit­er­acy, men­tal well-be­ing and sup­port for vic­tims.</p>
    <p>“We do not fully un­der­stand the shape of the ele­phant, much less tame the beast,” Mr Tan, pre­vi­ously the chief ex­ec­u­tive of the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Author­ity, said at the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress.</p>
    <p>“This ap­proach must change, so that we can adapt to the grow­ing com­plex­ity of the prob­lem.”</p>
    <p>By work­ing with in­dus­try rep­re­sen­ta­tives and part­ners like men­tal health pro­fes­sion­als, Sin­ga­pore will be able to deal with the mat­ter holis­ti­cally and stay on top of the is­sue, in­stead of play­ing catch-up as it of­ten does now, ow­ing to the fast pace of change, he said.</p>
    <p>Part­ners in the com­mu­nity also have a role to play in map­ping the so­cial and psy­cho­log­i­cal dynamics of the on­line space, the im­pact on vul­ner­a­ble groups and the sup­port they may need, and best prac­tices on how stu­dents can learn about these top­ics, he added.</p>
    <p>This new agency should also be em­pow­ered to make rec­om­men­da­tions on how to pre­vent on­line harm from com­ing to po­ten­tial vic­tims and to pro­vide timely help, even propos­ing changes to the law to do so, he said.</p>
    <p>He shared with the House var­i­ous anec­dotes of peo­ple who have fallen prey to bad ac­tors on­line, in­clud­ing an el­derly woman who was scammed out of more than $10,000 and a teenager who was pres­sured by a preda­tor to send nude pho­tos.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment can­not act alone in pre­vent­ing such cases from hap­pen­ing, and Mr Tan called on com­pa­nies to play their part by be­ing more thought­ful in their prod­ucts and ser­vices and build­ing in safety fea­tures from the out­set, just like how cars and con­sumer ap­pli­ances have to meet stan­dards be­fore be­ing sold.</p>
    <p>Tel­cos should also main­tain a com­mon data­base of black­listed num­bers and block in­com­ing calls from these num­bers, adding that these func­tions should be made ac­ces­si­ble to all se­niors, who are prime tar­gets for scams.</p>
    <p>So­cial me­dia plat­forms like­wise need to take ini­tia­tive to de­tect and re­solve bad be­hav­iour early, be­fore harm is done, said Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>He ac­knowl­edged that plat­forms such as In­sta­gram and Twit­ter have ex­ist­ing func­tions for re­port­ing con­tent, com­ments or ac­counts, but said they can work with the Govern­ment to bet­ter com­bat cy­ber bul­ly­ing and cy­ber groom­ing.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans can also con­trib­ute by help­ing one an­other not just ac­cess, but also nav­i­gate cy­berspace safely.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan sug­gested a new na­tional move­ment that could gal­vanise the ef­forts of pas­sion­ate in­di­vid­u­als and groups to pro­mote a cul­ture of in­clu­sive­ness, re­spect and safety on­line.</p>
    <p>Part of this ef­fort will be to cre­ate an en­vi­ron­ment to dis­cuss these is­sues in a sup­port­ive, non-stig­ma­tis­ing way, pro­vid­ing a safe space for vic­tims to come for­ward, said Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore­ans are proud that we have one of the safest streets in the world – we let our chil­dren and loved ones walk freely around the neigh­bour­hood, and we trust they have pleasant in­ter­ac­tions,” said Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>“Like­wise, we must also strive to build a safe and kind on­line space – one marked with care and re­spect, where ev­ery­one in­clud­ing our chil­dren and our se­niors can in­ter­act freely with­out con­stantly look­ing over their shoul­ders for preda­tors.”</p>
    <p>We do not fully un­der­stand the shape of the ele­phant, much less tame the beast. This ap­proach must change, so that we can adapt to the grow­ing com­plex­ity of ’’ the prob­lem.</p>
