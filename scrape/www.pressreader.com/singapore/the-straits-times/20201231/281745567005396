    <p>To es­cape the scourge of a con­ta­gious, mi­cro­scopic foe, var­i­ous na­tions went into lockdown ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>As peo­ple were con­fined to their homes, cars stowed away and in­dus­trial ac­tiv­i­ties slowed, it was as though an in­vis­i­ble broom had swept away the pall of smog, soot and harm­ful pol­lu­tants, to re­veal clear skies.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore saw im­prove­ments in its air qual­ity be­fore and dur­ing the two-month cir­cuit breaker, as key pol­lu­tants plum­meted to lev­els within the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s air qual­ity guide­lines, some of which the coun­try pre­vi­ously could not meet.</p>
    <p>In April, for the first time in decades, peo­ple in Pun­jab could view the Hi­malayan moun­tain range about 200km away as In­dia en­forced a na­tion­wide lockdown.</p>
    <p>The good news was that car­bon diox­ide emis­sions fell by a record 7 per cent this year, the Global Car­bon Pro­ject, an in­ter­na­tional group of re­searchers who track emis­sions, found.</p>
    <p>But the dip in emis­sions will ac­count for a neg­li­gi­ble 0.01 deg C re­duc­tion in global warm­ing by 2050, said the United Na­tions En­vi­ron­ment Pro­gramme’s (UNEP) lat­est Emis­sions Gap Re­port re­leased early this month.</p>
    <p>The world is still on a dan­ger­ous tra­jec­tory of a more than 3 deg C rise in tem­per­a­ture by the end of the century, fail­ing to meet the Paris Agree­ment’s goals of lim­it­ing global warm­ing to be­low 2 deg C.</p>
    <p>As lock­downs started to ease by mid-2020, many coun­tries re­turned to fos­sil fuel-based ac­tiv­i­ties to re­vive their economies.</p>
    <p>The Group of 20 (G-20) na­tions, which con­trib­ute about 78 per cent of global emis­sions, are spend­ing 50 per cent more in their Covid-19 stim­u­lus pack­ages on sec­tors linked to fos­sil fu­els than on low-car­bon en­ergy, said the United Na­tions Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral An­to­nio Guter­res at the Cli­mate Am­bi­tion Sum­mit this month.</p>
    <p>The G-20 com­prises 19 large ad­vanced and emerg­ing economies such as China, In­dia and the United States, and the Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts said the drop in car­bon emis­sions was largely caused by falls in avi­a­tion and land travel, but trans­port is not the largest green­house gas emit­ter. Glob­ally, most emis­sions come from power gen­er­a­tion and in­dus­trial ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>A per­ma­nent re­duc­tion in emis­sions can be achieved only by shift­ing away from the de­pen­dence on fos­sil fu­els.</p>
    <p>The UNEP re­port said the Covid-19 global eco­nomic down­turn pro­vided an op­por­tu­nity for na­tions to in­cor­po­rate de­car­bon­i­sa­tion ef­forts in their eco­nomic re­cov­er­ies. But few coun­tries have seized the mo­ment.</p>
    <p>Such a “green re­cov­ery” could shave up to 25 per cent off 2030 emis­sions, the re­port pro­jected.</p>
    <p>“En­vi­ron­men­tal and so­cial ben­e­fit should be an in­her­ent goal of any stim­u­lus, rather than treat­ing sus­tain­abil­ity as a ‘lux­ury good’,” said the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of In­ter­na­tional Af­fairs’ as­sis­tant di­rec­tor of sus­tain­abil­ity, Ms Meixi Gan.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts said Sin­ga­pore is on the right track as it re­vives its econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Un­der the coun­try’s Emerg­ing Stronger Task­force, sus­tain­abil­ity is the fo­cus of one of seven in­dus­try-led coali­tions. Sin­ga­pore wants to be­come a car­bon ser­vices hub in Asia to al­low for the ex­change of car­bon cred­its, cre­ate jobs, and en­hance the Re­pub­lic’s role in com­modi­ties trad­ing.</p>
    <p>The coun­try is also aim­ing to phase out ve­hi­cles with in­ter­nal com­bus­tion en­gines by 2040.</p>
    <p>De­spite the UNEP’s rec­om­men­da­tions, coun­tries gravely crip­pled by Covid-19 will likely choose to stick with the sta­tus quo rather than in­tro­duce un­fa­mil­iar al­ter­na­tives, noted weather and cli­mate sci­en­tist Koh Tieh Yong from the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing In­dia, the fourth largest green­house gas emit­ter, he said: “In­dia has wind farms. But why is it still us­ing coal? Many are strug­gling with poverty, and the coun­try chose (eco­nomic) op­tions that will yield results quickly.</p>
    <p>“From the en­vi­ron­men­tal point of view, it looks like a missed op­por­tu­nity when they don’t ap­por­tion the ma­jor­ity of their stim­u­lus pack­age on green en­er­gies. But the re­al­ity is they can’t do that be­cause they need the eco­nomic re­turns quickly to avoid a graver prob­lem.”</p>
    <p>Still, the onus re­mains on the ma­jor emit­ters – China, In­dia, the EU and the US – to do more to cut emis­sions.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity cli­mate sci­en­tist Win­ston Chow said: “Even if Sin­ga­pore de­car­bonises mostly by 2030, it will still be a drop in the ocean, in terms of meet­ing the Paris Agree­ment goals.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore con­trib­utes around 0.11 per cent of global emis­sions.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, China – the world’s largest car­bon emit­ter – promised to be car­bon neu­tral be­fore 2060, an am­bi­tion that UNEP wel­comed, along with mid-century net-zero emis­sion goals by other economies in­clud­ing the EU, Ja­pan and South Africa.</p>
    <p>“If China is able to suc­ceed in its 2060 goal, global tem­per­a­tures will in­crease by only 2.1 deg C by the end of the century,” said Prof Chow.</p>
    <p>Apart from cleaner air, the re­prieve offered by the re­duc­tion of hu­man ac­tiv­i­ties seemed for a mo­ment to be en­joyed by wildlife as well.</p>
    <p>Images abounded of, among many ex­am­ples, ot­ters frol­ick­ing out­side Mustafa Cen­tre and wild goats roaming the streets of a Welsh town.</p>
    <p>But the ur­ban ar­eas the an­i­mals strayed into may have been wilder­ness not that long ago, high­light­ing the ex­tent of the hu­man foot­print, said Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity botanist Shawn Lum.</p>
    <p>Be­yond the In­sta­grammable pic­tures, the pan­demic-bio­di­ver­sity link is bleak.</p>
    <p>The degra­da­tion of na­ture can in­crease the risk of fu­ture pan­demics as wildlife-hu­man con­tact may cause the spillover of new dis­eases, a re­cent re­port by The In­ter­gov­ern­men­tal Sci­ence-Pol­icy Plat­form on Bio­di­ver­sity and Ecosys­tem Ser­vices said.</p>
    <p>7% Record de­crease in car­bon diox­ide emis­sions this year, ac­cord­ing to the Global Car­bon Pro­ject, an in­ter­na­tional group of re­searchers who track emis­sions.</p>
    <p>-0.01 deg C Re­duc­tion in global warm­ing by 2050 as a re­sult of the dip in emis­sions, ac­cord­ing to the United Na­tions En­vi­ron­ment Pro­gramme’s lat­est Emis­sions Gap Re­port. Ex­perts said the drop in emis­sions was largely caused by falls in avi­a­tion and land travel. But most emis­sions come from power gen­er­a­tion and in­dus­trial ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
