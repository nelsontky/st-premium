    <p>Ju­nior col­leges and Mil­len­nia In­sti­tute (MI) can tap the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion’s (MOE) bulk ten­der to pur­chase per­sonal learn­ing de­vices (PLDs) for their stu­dents, MOE said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>This fol­lows the an­nounce­ment made ear­lier in the day that all se­condary and ju­nior col­lege stu­dents will un­der­take home-based learn­ing at least two days a month from the third term of next year.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the roll-out of PLDs by the end of next year ap­plies only to se­condary school stu­dents and not their JC coun­ter­parts.</p>
    <p>The de­vices – ei­ther tablets or lap­tops – will be cho­sen by each se­condary school from a range of models se­lected by MOE.</p>
    <p>This flex­i­ble ar­range­ment will al­low dif­fer­ent schools to choose a de­vice that best sup­ports their teach­ing and the learn­ing needs of their stu­dents.</p>
    <p>A min­istry spokesman said on Tues­day that each JC has de­vel­oped its own ap­proach to us­ing dig­i­tal de­vices for ed­u­ca­tional pur­poses.</p>
    <p>He added that the use of such de­vices has grown sig­nif­i­cantly over time.</p>
    <p>MOE will con­tinue to sup­port JCs and Mil­len­nia In­sti­tute with re­sources and train­ing, the spokesman said.</p>
    <p>MOE said its bulk ten­der will lower the cost for stu­dents but did not state how much each de­vice will cost them.</p>
    <p>It said cost will de­pend on the PLDs se­lected by the school and em­pha­sised that ex­pected outof-pocket ex­penses from stu­dents will be kept to a min­i­mum, as stu­dents may use their Edusave ac­count to pur­chase the de­vices.</p>
    <p>Un­der cur­rent Edusave dis­burse­ment rates, se­condary school stu­dents re­ceive $290 a year, amount­ing to be­tween $1,160 and $1,450 for four to five years of ed­u­ca­tion, while pri­mary school pupils re­ceive $230 a year, to­talling $1,380 over six years.</p>
    <p>On top of these, a one-off $200 top-up was given to all pri­mary and se­condary stu­dents in April.</p>
    <p>For Sin­ga­porean stu­dents on the MOE Fi­nan­cial As­sis­tance Scheme, a sub­sidy will be pro­vided, and those who still can­not af­ford t he de­vice with t heir Edusave bal­ance and the sub­sidy will be fur­ther aided to bring their out-of-pocket ex­penses to zero.</p>
    <p>The spokesman said yes­ter­day that se­condary school stu­dents who wish to use their own de­vices must have them meet spec­i­fi­ca­tions stated by the school.</p>
    <p>They must also al­low the school to in­stall a de­vice man­age­ment ap­pli­ca­tion on their de­vice, sim­i­lar to those in­stalled on school-se­lected de­vices.</p>
    <p>With­out nam­ing spe­cific de­vice models, MOE said on Tues­day that its se­lected range has dif­fer­ent op­er­at­ing sys­tems and spec­i­fi­ca­tions, all of which sup­port the run­ning of key ap­pli­ca­tions like the min­istry’s Sin­ga­pore Stu­dent Learn­ing Space por­tal.</p>
    <p>It added that the PLDs will last long enough to cover each stu­dent’s time in se­condary school.</p>
    <p>This flex­i­ble ar­range­ment will al­low dif­fer­ent schools to choose a de­vice that best sup­ports their teach­ing and the learn­ing needs of their stu­dents.</p>
