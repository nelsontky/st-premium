    <p>LON­DON • For­mer Bri­tish prime min­is­ter Tony Blair has been ac­cused of break­ing the coun­try’s Covid-19 re­stric­tions af­ter fail­ing to self-iso­late for two weeks fol­low­ing a two-day trip to the United States, the Sun­day Tele­graph re­ported.</p>
    <p>The news­pa­per said it had ob­tained pic­tures show­ing Mr Blair, who served as prime min­is­ter from 1997 to 2007, leav­ing a Lon­don restau­rant 10 days af­ter his re­turn from Wash­ing­ton last month.</p>
    <p>The Sun­day Tele­graph said it un­der­stood that Mr Blair had ap­pealed to White­hall of­fi­cials for spe­cial dis­pen­sa­tion from the Covid-19 rules, but that he was not is­sued with the for­mal ex­emp­tion let­ter he would have needed to avoid a 14-day iso­la­tion pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Mr Blair was in Wash­ing­ton for a</p>
    <p>White House cer­e­mony at which Is­rael signed agree­ments es­tab­lish­ing for­mal re­la­tions with Bahrain and the United Arab Emi­rates.</p>
    <p>The news­pa­per quoted a spokesman for Mr Blair as say­ing he was in­vited by the US gov­ern­ment be­cause of the role he played in the deal, de­scrib­ing the cer­e­mony as a “di­plo­matic con­fer­ence”.</p>
    <p>The spokesman also in­sisted Mr Blair “posed no risk to any­one” as he was tested be­fore his de­par­ture, on ar­rival at the White House, and again sev­eral times since re­turn­ing to Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral ma­jor fig­ures have been ac­cused of dam­ag­ing pub­lic con­fi­dence in the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment’s coro­n­avirus re­sponse by break­ing or ap­pear­ing to break rules.</p>
    <p>In May, Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son’s most se­nior ad­viser, Mr Dominic Cum­mings, re­fused to quit af­ter it emerged that he had driven 400km from Lon­don to north­ern Eng­land when all but es­sen­tial travel was for­bid­den.</p>
