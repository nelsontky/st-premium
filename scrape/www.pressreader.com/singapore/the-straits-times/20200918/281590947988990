    <p>Best-sell­ing Harry Pot­ter au­thor J.K. Rowl­ing (be­low) has stoked anger in the trans­gen­der com­mu­nity by in­clud­ing a cross-dress­ing se­rial killer in her lat­est novel, pub­lished on Tues­day. Penned un­der a pseu­do­nym, Trou­bled Blood is Rowl­ing’s fifth book to fea­ture pri­vate in­ves­ti­ga­tor Cor­moran Strike, the first four of which have been drama­tised by the BBC.</p>
    <p>LON­DON • Best­selling Harry Pot­ter au­thor J. K. Rowl­ing (left) has stoked anger in the trans­gen­der com­mu­nity by in­clud­ing a cross-dress­ing se­rial killer in her lat­est novel, pub­lished on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Penned un­der the pseu­do­nym Robert Gal­braith, Trou­bled Blood is Rowl­ing’s fifth book to fea­ture pri­vate in­ves­ti­ga­tor Cor­moran Strike, the first four of which have been drama­tised by the BBC.</p>
    <p>Rowl­ing, 55, has faced se­rial ac­cu­sa­tions of trans­pho­bia in re­cent months and trans ac­tivists said the new book ap­peared to take a de­lib­er­ate swipe at the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“It’s re­ally sad to see this road J.K. Rowl­ing ap­pears to be on,” said writer and trans ad­vo­cate Ugla Ste­fa­nia Kristjonud­ot­tir Jons­dot­tir, who quit Rowl­ing’s lit­er­ary agency in J une i n protest against the writer’s stance.</p>
    <p>“It’s one thing to have di­verse char­ac­ters, but when you write about a man dress­ing up as a woman in or­der to kill women, you are de­lib­er­ately en­forc­ing an aw­ful trope about trans­gen­der peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>The trans-rights row does not ap­pear to have dented sales, how­ever, with the var­i­ous hardback, au­dio­book and Kin­dle ver­sions of</p>
    <p>Trou­bled Blood all oc­cu­py­ing top five po­si­tions in Ama­zon’s best­sellers’ list.</p>
    <p>The book re­volves around the case of a woman missing since 1974 and pre­sumed to be the un­known vic­tim of a long-jailed se­rial killer.</p>
    <p>In one scene in the novel, the mur­derer dis­guises him­self as a woman to abduct his vic­tim.</p>
    <p>Rowl­ing, whose Harry Pot­ter se­ries has sold more than 500 mil­lion books, weighed into the tran­srights de­bate in June, when she pub­lished an ini­tial tweet crit­i­cis­ing a head­line that said “cre­at­ing a more equal post-Covid-19 world for peo­ple who men­stru­ate”.</p>
    <p>But while many in the trans com­mu­nity were out­raged by what they saw as fur­ther trans­pho­bia from the world’s wealth­i­est au­thor, oth­ers have de­fended her.</p>
    <p>Scot­tish ac­tor Rob­bie Coltrane, who played the gen­tle gi­ant Rubeus Ha­grid in the Harry Pot­ter film se­ries (2001 to 2011), told a Bri­tish mag­a­zine that peo­ple were “wait­ing to be of­fended”.</p>
    <p>Ms Bev Jack­son, co-founder of ac­tivist group LGB Al­liance, said it was “ex­tra­or­di­nary that peo­ple have opin­ions about a book they haven’t read”.</p>
    <p>“There are thou­sands of thrillers pub­lished ev­ery year, many of them will fea­ture peo­ple who dress up in dis­guises, and this is fic­tion,” she added.</p>
