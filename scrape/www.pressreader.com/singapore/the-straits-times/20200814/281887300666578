    <p>This year was sup­posed to be key for promis­ing Chilean bal­let dancer Sofia Shaw. But her hopes were dashed by the ar­rival of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Shaw had made it into the cap­i­tal city San­ti­ago’s mu­nic­i­pal bal­let school last year. The 19-year-old had told her­self be­fore the pan­demic struck that she was go­ing to give it her all this year, and re­ally im­prove.</p>
    <p>Orig­i­nally from Chillan city in cen­tral Chile, Shaw was able to move to the cap­i­tal thanks to her per­se­ver­ance and the sup­port of her mother, who works as an in-house maid to fi­nance her daugh­ter’s dream.</p>
    <p>But in March, as the start of classes ap­proached, her life came to a stand­still. “They said quar­an­tine would only last two weeks. I was hope­ful,” she told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>But on­line classes are just not the same for the dancer, who has even in­stalled a barre in her small apart­ment to prac­tise. “Some­times, I lift my legs and bang into the wall. But at least I can do the ba­sics.”</p>
    <p>Chile has faced one of Latin Amer­ica’s fiercest coro­n­avirus out­breaks, but case and fa­tal­ity rates have de­clined steadily over the last two months, Reuters re­ported.</p>
    <p>For now, her only hope is that life will soon go back to a new nor­mal where she can con­tinue to pur­sue her dream of dancing.</p>
