    <p>LONDON • Leeds United have only reached “base camp’ after se­cur­ing pro­mo­tion to the Premier League and their vi­sion is to re­turn to the Cham­pi­ons League in the com­ing sea­sons, chief ex­ec­u­tive An­gus Kin­n­ear has said.</p>
    <p>Leeds were pro­moted to the Premier League on Fri­day after sec­ond-placed West Bromwich Al­bion’s loss at Hud­der­s­field Town be­fore be­ing con­firmed as cham­pi­ons with Brent­ford’s de­feat by Stoke City on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Marcelo Bielsa’s men did not take their foot off the gas and reached 90 points yes­ter­day with a 3-1 win at Derby.</p>
    <p>Ahead of their fi­nal Cham­pi­onship match this week, Leeds want to dream big again.</p>
    <p>“Whilst we’re cel­e­brat­ing, whilst we’re all very ex­cited, we’ve got back to where we be­long. This re­ally is base camp for Leeds,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Now, it’s go­ing to be re­ally about build­ing on that and mak­ing sure that over the next few years, we start to com­pete at the level Leeds should be com­pet­ing in, which ul­ti­mately is the top six.</p>
    <p>“Leeds should have a Premier League team. Can­didly, Leeds should have a Cham­pi­ons League team and that’s the vi­sion.”</p>
    <p>The top four re­mains an in­cred­i­bly tough group to break into – only Everton and Le­ices­ter, when they se­cured the league in 2016 – have man­aged to up­set the hege­mony of English foot­ball’s “Big Six”, dat­ing back to the 2004-05 sea­son.</p>
    <p>Even Leeds, dur­ing their last hey</p>
    <p>LOFTY AM­BI­TIONS</p>
    <p>Leeds should have a Premier League team. Can­didly, Leeds should have a Cham­pi­ons League team and that’s the vi­sion.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>AN­GUS KIN­N­EAR, Leeds’ chief ex­ec­u­tive, out­lin­ing the English Cham­pi­onship win­ners’ am­bi­tious tar­gets after re­turn­ing to the big time.</p>
    <p>day when they played Euro­pean foot­ball for five con­sec­u­tive sea­sons from 1998 to 2003, qual­i­fied only once for the Cham­pi­ons League dur­ing that pe­riod.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Kin­n­ear, who was ap­pointed in 2017, be­lieves the sleep­ing giants, who reached the 1975 Euro­pean Cup fi­nal and the 1973 Uefa Cup-Win­ners’ Cup fi­nal, must strive to hit those heights once again.</p>
    <p>If Leeds are to do the un­think­able and shake up the es­tab­lished or­der, 64-year-old man­ager Bielsa will have to re­main at the helm.</p>
    <p>Such has been his im­pact at El­land Road since ar­riv­ing in June 2018 that the for­mer Ar­gentina coach has been linked with clubs like Fiorentina and Roma.</p>
    <p>His con­tract is due to ex­pire at the end of the sea­son but Kin­n­ear feels Bielsa is in for the long haul.</p>
    <p>“He has a re­view, he knows the di­rec­tion he wants to take the club in,” the Leeds chief said.</p>
    <p>“The chal­lenge with Marcelo is his in­ten­tions are al­ways a bit of a mys­tery... think he’s fallen in love with the club. I think he’s com­mit­ted to it.”</p>
    <p>The play­ers, mean­while, are still bask­ing in their achieve­ment as Cham­pi­onship win­ners.</p>
    <p>Cap­tain Liam Cooper said: “I’m ab­so­lutely de­lighted. This club has been in the dol­drums for 16 years and to be part of the club and this group of play­ers is hon­estly un­be­liev­able.”</p>
