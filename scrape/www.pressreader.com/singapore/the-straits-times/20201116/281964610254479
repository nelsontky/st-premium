    <p>Much as I sym­pa­thise with</p>
    <p>Mr Lim Wei Yang’s sit­u­a­tion re­gard­ing his neigh­bour’s home alarm go­ing off in the wee hours and the re­sponses he re­ceived (Cit­i­zen feed­back: Govt chan­nels could be more re­spon­sive, Nov 13), I beg to dif­fer.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, I sent two e-mails that re­ceived quick re­sponses.</p>
    <p>On July 14 at 8.10am, I sent a long list of com­plaints and sug­ges­tions to my MP, Mr Heng Chee How. At 4.17pm, he re­sponded and promised to look into the is­sues.</p>
    <p>I have a torn menis­cus and the only upright bi­cy­cle in the fit­ness cor­ner be­side my block is al­ways oc­cu­pied by res­i­dents from other es­tates and nearby con­do­mini­ums that do not have such a fa­cil­ity. I have to wake up at 5am to use the bi­cy­cle.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng not only paid me a visit but also kept his prom­ise. To­day, there is an upright bi­cy­cle newly in­stalled nearby.</p>
    <p>Other mat­ters I raised with him were also looked into.</p>
    <p>Last month, I con­tacted the Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion (PA) re­gard­ing prob­lems with my PAs­sion card, and EZ-Link on an auto top-up is­sue.</p>
    <p>Both re­sponded to my feed­back – PA after two weeks and EZ-Link after two days.</p>
    <p>I am very im­pressed not only with the re­sponses but also the kind­ness and help I re­ceived from my MP, the PA cus­tomer ser­vice staff who ad­vised and di­rected me to the ap­pro­pri­ate chan­nel, and also Ms Joanna Lim from EZ-Link, who ended her e-mail with “Stay safe in these dif­fi­cult times”.</p>
    <p>This pi­o­neer salutes all of you.</p>
