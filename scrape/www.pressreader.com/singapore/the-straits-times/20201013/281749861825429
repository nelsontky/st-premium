    <p>WASHINGTON Top US in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­pert An­thony Fauci says his words were taken out of con­text in a new cam­paign ad prais­ing Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s han­dling of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“The com­ments at­trib­uted to me with­out my per­mis­sion in the GOP cam­paign ad were taken out of con­text from a broad state­ment I made months ago about the ef­forts of fed­eral pub­lic health of­fi­cials,” Dr Fauci said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump re­sponded on Twit­ter that the favourable com­ments “are in­deed Dr Fauci’s own words”, adding: “Many peo­ple agree... And now come the Vac­cines & Cures, long ahead of pro­jec­tions!”</p>
    <p>The ad­ver­tise­ment re­leased by the Trump cam­paign last week in­cludes a brief clip of Dr Fauci say­ing: “I can’t imag­ine that any­body could be do­ing more.” His com­ment in a March in­ter­view with Fox News gave the im­pres­sion he was re­fer­ring to Mr Trump. The cam­paign ad did not note the date.</p>
    <p>“In my nearly five decades of pub­lic ser­vice, I have never pub­licly en­dorsed any po­lit­i­cal can­di­date,” Dr Fauci, 79, said in his state­ment.</p>
    <p>CNN said the 30-sec­ond spot has aired in Michi­gan, a bat­tle­ground state. Trump cam­paign spokesman Tim Mur­taugh said the com­ments in the ad “are Dr Fauci’s own words. The video is from a na­tion­ally broad­cast tele­vi­sion in­ter­view in which Dr Fauci was prais­ing the work of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion. The words spo­ken are ac­cu­rate, and di­rectly from Dr Fauci’s mouth”.</p>
