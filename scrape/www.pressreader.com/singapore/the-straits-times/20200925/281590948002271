    <p>The im­pact of the pan­demic has caused anx­i­ety in three in four Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents, ac­cord­ing to a study by mar­ket­ing com­mu­ni­ca­tions agency Wun­der­man Thomp­son. The econ­omy, which has taken a big hit, was the main cause of anx­i­ety among those sur­veyed.</p>
    <p>The im­pact of the coronaviru­s outbreak has caused anx­i­ety among three in four Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents, ac­cord­ing to a study con­ducted by mar­ket­ing com­mu­ni­ca­tions agency Wun­der­man Thomp­son.</p>
    <p>The re­sults of the study, which polled 500 re­spon­dents be­tween June 29 and July 6, were re­leased yes­ter­day. The econ­omy, which has taken a big hit in the wake of the outbreak here, was the main cause of anx­i­ety among those sur­veyed.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy con­tracted by 13.2 per cent year on year in the sec­ond quar­ter, the worst on record.</p>
    <p>About 78 per cent of those in the study said that they were anx­ious about eco­nomic is­sues, with a ma­jor­ity wor­ry­ing about is­sues such as un­em­ploy­ment rates and the cur­rent state of the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Among the 18- to 24-year-olds, their main con­cerns were find­ing jobs that fit their skills, with the grad­u­ates fac­ing dif­fi­culty in their job search, the sur­vey showed.</p>
    <p>Health con­cerns also fig­ured high on the list of anx­i­ety causes, with 73 per cent of re­spon­dents say­ing they were wor­ried about such is­sues.</p>
    <p>A ma­jor­ity of those who were trou­bled about health in­di­cated that they were anx­ious about global pan­demic diseases, such as Covid-19.</p>
    <p>When it came to Covid-19, two main con­cerns dom­i­nated: the fear of con­tract­ing the dis­ease in public spaces, and worry about the longterm eco­nomic dis­rup­tion from the pan­demic fall­out.</p>
    <p>About 37 per cent said they were both­ered about their fam­i­lies and friends con­tract­ing the virus, as many as those who feared catch­ing it them­selves at public places.</p>
    <p>Thirty-six per cent were afraid of catch­ing Covid-19 on public trans­port, while about 33 per cent feared be­ing in­fected while in a taxi or ride-hail­ing ve­hi­cle.</p>
    <p>On the Covid-19 eco­nomic dis­rup­tion, 40 per cent were wor­ried it would go on for a re­ally long time.</p>
    <p>A sim­i­lar per­cent­age feared that the econ­omy would crash, while 30 per cent were anx­ious about los­ing their jobs.</p>
    <p>Wun­der­man Thomp­son In­tel­li­gence Asia-Pa­cific direc­tor Chen May Yee said: “Dif­fer­ent groups are anx­ious about dif­fer­ent things but what’s clear is peo­ple are anx­ious on mul­ti­ple lev­els... Mean­while, (peo­ple) are also look­ing at the wider econ­omy and brac­ing (them­selves) for what is yet to come.”</p>
    <p>Well-be­ing and lead­er­ship coach Nitya Rao-Per­era said that it is im­por­tant to deal with such fears, as be­ing anx­ious can lead to a num­ber of dif­fer­ent con­di­tions such as de­pres­sion or burnout.</p>
    <p>“What can in­no­cently creep up as feel­ings of doom and de­spair, be­ing in­de­ci­sive or un­sure, can lead to some­thing more com­pli­cated,” she said. To com­bat this, she sug­gested that peo­ple fo­cus on things that are within their con­trol, re­mem­ber that life’s great­est lessons are usu­ally learnt at the worst times, and re­frame one’s in­ter­pre­ta­tion of a sit­u­a­tion to per­ceive it more pos­i­tively.</p>
