    <p>As Bri­tain be­comes sub­sumed by a sec­ond wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions and deaths, the coun­try’s doc­tors and nurses are brac­ing them­selves for what is ex­pected to be a del­uge of new pa­tients over the next six months.</p>
    <p>But un­like in the spring, they say they are now fac­ing the pan­demic with­out the same sense of cau­tion among a coro­n­avirus-weary pub­lic or a clear gov­ern­ment strat­egy to con­tain the virus and deal with rapidly fill­ing in­ten­sive care units.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, morale is wilt­ing among over­stretched health work­ers.</p>
    <p>Hos­pi­tals have can­celled non-es­sen­tial op­er­a­tions and trans­ferred pa­tients to nearby fa­cil­i­ties, a re­sult of crowd­ing caused in part by the gov­ern­ment’s ef­fort to restart elec­tive pro­ce­dures halted in the spring. Some emer­gency units are al­ready telling non-ur­gent pa­tients to stay away again.</p>
    <p>“We’ve been through it once be­fore, and it wasn’t very nice, but there was an end to it,” said Dr Ali­son Pit­tard, dean of the Fac­ulty of In­ten­sive Care Medicine. “Whereas now, this is go­ing to go on for much longer. We did not and do not have enough staff.”</p>
    <p>When the coro­n­avirus first hit Bri­tain in the spring, the Na­tional Health Ser­vice or­dered hos­pi­tals to empty beds and stop elec­tive pro­ce­dures. Heed­ing gov­ern­ment ap­peals, many peo­ple stayed away by choice.</p>
    <p>Politi­cians across the po­lit­i­cal spec­trum largely ac­cepted the need for the first lock­down, and doc­tors limped through the cri­sis, fu­elled by adren­a­line and the hope that the gov­ern­ment could keep an even­tual resur­gence of cases from in­un­dat­ing the health ser­vice again.</p>
    <p>But that has not hap­pened. With 367 deaths and 22,885 con­firmed cases on Tues­day alone, Bri­tain is swamped by a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions that could pose an even big­ger test than the first wave for its overex­tended health ser­vice.</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion is hardly bet­ter else­where in Europe.</p>
    <p>A resur­gence of Covid-19 cases in Spain has pushed ex­hausted doc­tors to stage their first na­tional strike in 25 years on Tues­day to de­mand bet­ter work­ing con­di­tions and greater recog­ni­tion.</p>
    <p>About 85 per cent of Spain’s 267,000 doc­tors took part in the walk­out although most of them did so sym­bol­i­cally as they con­tin­ued to see pa­tients, said the State Con­fed­er­a­tion of Med­i­cal Union.</p>
    <p>Clad in white lab coats, dozens of them protested out­side Par­lia­ment in Madrid at a safe dis­tance from one another, many hold­ing posters of a large black boot about to stomp on a group of healthcare work­ers.</p>
    <p>One of them said “the straw that broke the camel’s back” was a gov­ern­ment de­cree say­ing they could be as­signed to other hos­pi­tal ser­vices, re­gard­less of their spe­cial­i­sa­tion, when­ever needed.</p>
    <p>Bel­gian hos­pi­tals are so over­whelmed that of­fi­cials asked doc­tors in­fected with the coro­n­avirus to work if they were not show­ing symp­toms. Its gov­ern­ment is con­sid­er­ing a new na­tional lock­down, with the coun­try now suf­fer­ing the high­est rate of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions. The na­tion of 11 mil­lion peo­ple had 1,390 new in­fec­tions per 100,000 res­i­dents over the past two weeks, ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cial data. It also has one of the high­est per capita Covid-19 fa­tal­ity rates in the world.</p>
    <p>Like­wise in Ger­many, Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel is ex­pected to press re­gional lead­ers to agree to a par­tial lock­down in Ger­many which would see restau­rants and bars closed but keep schools open, as the num­ber of new in­fec­tions hit a record high. Cases rose to 464,239 yes­ter­day with 10,183 deaths.</p>
    <p>The dras­tic mea­sures, to take ef­fect from Nov 4, will al­low peo­ple to go out only with mem­bers from their own and one other house­hold.</p>
    <p>In many ways, doc­tors in Bri­tain are bet­ter equipped to han­dle the sec­ond wave of a pan­demic that has killed roughly 60,000 peo­ple in the coun­try, the high­est toll in Europe.</p>
    <p>The scarci­ties that pan­icked doc­tors in March – of face masks, test­ing kits and oxy­gen – have largely been al­le­vi­ated. Doc­tors have learnt to de­lay us­ing ven­ti­la­tors.</p>
    <p>But a de­ci­sion by the health ser­vice to re­store nor­mal ser­vices in Bri­tain has meant that there are fewer un­oc­cu­pied hos­pi­tal beds than there were in the spring and fewer doc­tors who can be re­de­ployed to coro­n­avirus wards.</p>
    <p>Mak­ing mat­ters worse, hos­pi­tals are al­ready treat­ing the usual win­ter­time stream of flu and other ill­nesses that, even in a nor­mal year, can push bed oc­cu­pancy rates past 95 per cent.</p>
    <p>As a sense of bat­tle fa­tigue sets in, many health work­ers are call­ing in sick.</p>
    <p>“The first time around, it’s al­most like a once-in-a-life­time kind of med­i­cal chal­lenge,” said Dr Paul Whi­taker, a res­pi­ra­tory doc­tor in Brad­ford, north­ern Eng­land, where the num­ber of coro­n­avirus pa­tients has re­turned to its early May peak.</p>
    <p>“But the prospect of go­ing into another six months is rel­a­tively fright­en­ing. How are you go­ing to main­tain the morale, the fo­cus and the en­ergy of all these peo­ple?”</p>
