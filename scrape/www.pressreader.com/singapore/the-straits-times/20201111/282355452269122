    <p>NAIROBI • Kenya’s North Rift has for decades won ac­co­lades for pro­duc­ing some of the most dis­tin­guished ath­letes in the world.</p>
    <p>The moun­tain­ous re­gion has nur­tured run­ners who have gone on to win ti­tles on the global stage.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the town of El­doret – the base of 2016 Rio Games gold medal­list and world record-holder in the marathon, Eliud Kip­choge, and its en­vi­rons – have wit­nessed tremen­dous eco­nomic growth on ac­count of large in­vest­ments in­jected by their elite run­ners.</p>
    <p>“The econ­omy of this town has al­ways been de­pen­dent on farm­ing. How­ever, in re­cent years, we have seen in­vest­ments from ath­letes com­pete with agri­cul­tural rev­enues,” said Philip Kem­boi, an of­fi­cial at Uasin Gishu county.</p>
    <p>“The town is now at­trac­tive to in­vestors thanks to the new ameni­ties and bet­ter in­fra­struc­ture.”</p>
    <p>Known for sup­ply­ing maize and wheat to the rest of Kenya, El­doret is now tak­ing on a new sta­tus as a com­mer­cial hub, with de­vel­op­ments such as high-rise build­ings, malls and in­ter­na­tional schools help­ing to at­tract in­vestors.</p>
    <p>Ivy Lan­gat, who owns a chain of en­ter­prises, most of which are found in build­ings owned by fa­mous ath­letes, re­calls the dras­tic changes in El­doret over the years.</p>
    <p>“The town is not as it was 10 years ago. There were a few com­mer­cial build­ings in the Cen­tral Busi­ness Dis­trict. More­over, they were a pre­serve of the af­flu­ent busi­ness own­ers who could af­ford high rents,” she said.</p>
    <p>An­drew Rotich, a sea­soned run­ner and pace­set­ter, said that he man­aged to buy land off the pro­ceeds from his first race.</p>
    <p>“I built a home for my fam­ily and there­after, I bought a few more plots that I am yet to de­velop, hope­fully, I will con­struct rentals or dis­pose of plots,” he said.</p>
    <p>In El­doret, ath­let­ics is a her­itage. The cul­ture of run­ning is so in­grained in the lives of the lo­cals that au­thor­i­ties have erected a gi­gan­tic TV screen where ma­jor races can be watched by fans.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the Lon­don Marathon last month, thou­sands of res­i­dents, in­clud­ing politi­cians, cel­e­brated as Brigid Kos­gei, an­other run­ner who has made the town her home, re­tained her women’s ti­tle.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has hit run­ners and lo­cals hard – four of the six World Marathon Ma­jors were axed this year, while Tokyo and a con­densed Lon­don edi­tion were held be­hind closed doors – but sports­wear en­tre­pre­neur Faith Modi is hope­ful things will grad­u­ally get back to nor­mal by next year.</p>
    <p>“Many ath­letes are not mov­ing out of the county to com­pete, there­fore the up­take is low and far apart,” she said. “My hope is that or­gan­is­ers will sched­ule more races in the com­ing months be­cause the ath­letes are slowly get­ting de­mor­alised.”</p>
