    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>You are ir­ri­tated with some­one and he or she is sure to know by the time you are done with him or her. The good news is you patch up quickly.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>Do not lec­ture oth­ers. No­body wants to hear how wrong he or she is, even if noth­ing can get done. Wait for a bet­ter day.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20) Fo­cus on your friends, fam­ily or clos­est busi­ness con­tacts. You should be able to get peo­ple to see things your way soon.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Things are look­ing good, as long as you can keep your op­tions open for one more day. The sit­u­a­tion should make a lot more sense to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Your ad­ven­tur­ous en­ergy is amaz­ing. Your peo­ple may not have the stamina to keep up with you, but you can tell them all about it later.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>You have to let the uni­verse call the shots. Do not let any­one con­vince you to try to force your point of view on the world.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>You have to stick with what­ever is on your plate. You should be able to glide through to­day’s projects and make room for up­com­ing ones.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>You may get lost in the crowd of oth­ers who are try­ing to im­press the world. If any­thing, you may sur­prise them all in the end.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>You can bring a smile to al­most any face. You find that one par­tic­u­lar act of kind­ness is re­paid quickly, though there is no rea­son to stop there.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>You are mov­ing at greater speed and may leave your al­lies in the dust. It is not the best time to ex­pect sup­port. You can get by on your own.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>It is a day of com­mu­nion, which can mean dif­fer­ent things to dif­fer­ent peo­ple. You may need to spend time with like-minded peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>You want to shake some­one by the col­lar un­til he or she straight­ens out, but that would be fu­tile. Things will look up for ev­ery­one.</p>
