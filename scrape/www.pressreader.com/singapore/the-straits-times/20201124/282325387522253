    <p>France rugby coach Fa­bien Galthie praised his team’s abil­ity to get re­sults af­ter Les Bleus claimed their third win in a row by beat­ing Scot­land 22-15 at Mur­ray­field in the Au­tumn Na­tions Cup on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>France, who were suf­fer­ing from a lack of con­sis­tency be­fore Galthie took over ear­lier this year, have now won six of seven Tests un­der their new coach.</p>
    <p>“I’m sat­is­fied by the vic­tory, which is the ul­ti­mate goal. And also to­tally sat­is­fied with the play­ers’ be­hav­iour and this se­ries of three wins against Celtic na­tions,” he said of his team, who also beat Wales in a friendly and Ire­land in a coro­n­avirus-de­layed Six Na­tions fi­nale last month.</p>
    <p>Cen­tre Vir­imi Vakatawa scored the only try early in the sec­ond half in Ed­in­burgh af­ter com­bin­ing with winger Vin­cent Rat­tez fol­low­ing a line-out.</p>
    <p>“It was part of the plan,” said Galthie. “We pre­pare our line-outs ac­cord­ing to our op­po­nents. This time it worked, it was a two-pass try that al­lowed us to score points with­out spend­ing too much en­ergy.”</p>
    <p>France will now have to work with a re­vamped squad for their last Group B match against Italy fol­low­ing an agree­ment be­tween the fed­er­a­tion and the league which al­lows each player to feature on a max­i­mum of three team sheets over the au­tumn Tests.</p>
    <p>“There is no frus­tra­tion. We did what we had to do,” said Galthie, who will be with­out scrum-half and Six Na­tions Player of the</p>
    <p>Cham­pi­onship, An­toine Dupont, who has played three Tests.</p>
    <p>France lead Group B with nine points, hav­ing been awarded a 28-0 vic­tory against Fiji af­ter the game was can­celled fol­low­ing a string of Covid-19 cases within the Pa­cific Is­lan­ders’ team.</p>
    <p>Scot­land are sec­ond on six points and Italy – Les Bleus’ op­po­nents at the Stade de France on Saturday – are one point fur­ther adrift. The fi­nal round of closed­door Tests will be staged the fol­low­ing week­end.</p>
