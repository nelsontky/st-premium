    <p>The pan­demic has led many mil­len­ni­als to re-ex­am­ine the longterm prospects of their jobs – but few may have done so with as much comic-book flair as Mr He Ruiming and Mr Goh Wei Choon.</p>
    <p>The pair, both 31, quit their jobs this year to work full time on their comic-style per­sonal fi­nance blog The Woke Salary­man.</p>
    <p>Their post in Septem­ber on things to con­sider be­fore chang­ing ca­reers in one’s 30s in­cludes ad­vice such as con­sid­er­ing in­come and growth op­por­tu­ni­ties be­sides fol­low­ing one’s pas­sion, and be­ing fi­nan­cially pre­pared be­fore hand­ing in a res­ig­na­tion let­ter. It be­came one of their most pop­u­lar ca­reer-re­lated posts.</p>
    <p>An­other was on how to earn a higher salary: Make sure your skill set is in short sup­ply.</p>
    <p>“Many Sin­ga­pore­ans think that get­ting a de­gree guar­an­tees a high salary; no longer. We need to take into ac­count what the job mar­ket wants, and adapt ac­cord­ingly,” said Mr He and Mr Goh in an email in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>Mr He, who writes, and Mr Goh, who il­lus­trates, started the blog in April last year. What be­gan as a pro­ject to teach brands how to cre­ate social con­tent took on a life of its own when their comics and ar­ti­cles started go­ing vi­ral.</p>
    <p>They post most ac­tively on In­sta­gram and Face­book, where they have about 179,000 and 200,000 fol­low­ers, re­spec­tively. Such com­mu­ni­ties can help peo­ple feel less alone when fac­ing inse­cu­ri­ties, said Mr He and Mr Goh.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore­ans are nat­u­rally a shy bunch and can find it hard to ap­proach friends or peers. We pro­vide a non-judg­men­tal and anony­mous plat­form for peo­ple to ask stuff that might raise eye­brows in real life.”</p>
    <p>Be­sides draw­ing on their own ex­pe­ri­ences to cre­ate their posts, they con­sult hu­man re­source prac­ti­tion­ers, ca­reer coaches, re­cruiters, in­dus­try ex­perts and peo­ple who have found suc­cess in their ca­reers.</p>
    <p>“When pos­si­ble, we also cross­check... with in­dus­try-spe­cific White Pa­pers to make sure the in­for­ma­tion we pub­lish can be trusted,” they said.</p>
    <p>In their pre­vi­ous jobs, Mr He was a cre­ative lead at prop­erty por­tal 99.co and Mr Goh was a cre­ative mar­ket­ing spe­cial­ist at med­i­cal de­vice com­pany Dornier MedTech.</p>
    <p>They now earn money through branded con­tent part­ner­ships, en­abling them to reach their fi­nan­cial goals while pro­vid­ing free con­tent for read­ers.</p>
    <p>They said: “Hav­ing a voice on social media al­lows us to ad­vo­cate for things we be­lieve in, (like) men­tal health, gra­cious­ness in so­ci­ety and the im­por­tance of per­sonal re­spon­si­bil­ity.”</p>
