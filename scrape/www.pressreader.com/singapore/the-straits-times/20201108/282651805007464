    <p>Strength build­ing is cru­cial in pre­vent­ing in­jury and can help to im­prove or main­tain run­ning form through bet­ter co­or­di­na­tion.</p>
    <p>For run­ners, strength build­ing would largely fo­cus on ex­er­cises which build mus­cle en­durance, such as lift­ing light weights or us­ing body weight to per­form high­rep­e­ti­tion ex­er­cises.</p>
    <p>Im­proved up­per-body strength can help re­duce the load on your lower body dur­ing runs. A strong up­per body, cou­pled with strong sta­biliser mus­cles, can help to main­tain good run­ning form and sup­port in for­ward move­ment dur­ing each stride.</p>
    <p>A weak up­per body may re­sult in ro­ta­tion of the up­per torso, which causes loss of sta­bil­ity and the body may have to work harder to en­sure a proper run­ning pos­ture, which trans­lates to wasted en­ergy.</p>
    <p>As run­ners, our leg mus­cles need to be strong in or­der to im­prove our bal­ance and run­ning form. Our thigh mus­cles play an im­por­tant role in sta­bil­is­ing our knees to re­duce in­jury and also help to ab­sorb the shock from each stride.</p>
    <p>These ex­er­cises will help to tar­get the es­sen­tial mus­cle groups and im­prove your run­ning form.</p>
    <p>UP­PER BODY AND STABILISER­S</p>
    <p>1. PUSH-UPS</p>
    <p>(3 sets of 15-20 rep­e­ti­tions)</p>
    <p>2. HIGH BIRD DOG PLANK (3 sets of 10 reps)</p>
    <p>How to do:</p>
    <p>• Get into a push-up po­si­tion, hands shoul­der width apart. • Raise one arm and the op­po­site leg off the ground and hold them straight for 3-5 sec­onds.</p>
    <p>• Re­turn your arm and leg to the start­ing po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>• Do the same with your other arm and op­po­site leg.</p>
    <p>• Re­peat the se­quence. 3. SIN­GLE-LEG BRIDGE</p>
    <p>(3 sets of 15 reps for each leg)</p>
    <p>How to do:</p>
    <p>• Lie face up on the floor with knees bent, feet flat on floor, arms rest­ing at sides.</p>
    <p>• Ex­tend right leg straight out, keep­ing both knees in line. • Press through left heel to lift hips up to­wards ceil­ing, then slowly lower back down. • Com­plete reps, then re­peat on the other leg.</p>
    <p>4. SIDE-LY­ING LEG LIFT</p>
    <p>(3 sets of 30 reps on each leg)</p>
    <p>How to do:</p>
    <p>• Lie on right side with legs ex­tended out straight. Place your right hand un­der your head.</p>
    <p>• Lift left leg up while keep­ing your hips steady and fac­ing for­ward (do not ro­tate back­wards).</p>
    <p>• Lower leg and re­peat. Do the same for the other leg.</p>
    <p>Note: Place a re­sis­tance band around an­kles for a chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>LOWER BODY</p>
    <p>6. SQUATS</p>
    <p>(3 sets of 20 reps)</p>
    <p>7. SIDE TO SIDE SKATERS (3 sets 20 reps)</p>
    <p>How to do:</p>
    <p>• Stand­ing with your legs hip-width apart, with hips and knees slightly bent.</p>
    <p>• Shift your weight onto your left leg and lift your right foot off the ground.</p>
    <p>• Bend your left (stand­ing) knee to lower your hips a few cen­time­tres, push ex­plo­sively off your left foot be­fore land­ing on your right foot.</p>
    <p>• After you land, bring your left leg to­wards your right an­kle with­out it touch­ing the floor. • Re­peat for the other side. Note: You should jump as far as pos­si­ble so that when you land, you im­me­di­ately take off again to the other side. For an added chal­lenge, touch the floor with your hand at very rep. The deeper you go, the more you will have to ac­ti­vate your hip flexor mus­cles.</p>
    <p>8. STEP UP WITH KNEE RAISE (3 sets of 15 reps for each leg)</p>
    <p>How to do:</p>
    <p>• Find a chair or bench and place it in front of you. En­sure the plat­form is sta­ble.</p>
    <p>• Step up on the plat­form with your left leg. Lift your right knee and raise it in front of you into the air.</p>
    <p>• Step down with your right leg. Re­peat ex­er­cise with the same leg and switch upon com­ple­tion of the num­ber of rep­e­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>9. LUNGES</p>
    <p>(3 sets of 20 reps)</p>
    <p>How to do:</p>
    <p>• Stand in a split stance with the right foot for­ward and the left leg back. Feet should be about 0.6m to 1m apart. The split stance will re­quire bal­ance, so hold on to a wall or chair if you feel un­sta­ble. Be­fore you lunge, make sure your torso is straight and toes are point­ing straight to­wards the front.</p>
    <p>• Bend the knees and lower the body down un­til the back knee is a few cen­time­tres from the floor. Both knees at 90 deg an­gle.</p>
    <p>• At the end of the move­ment, the front thigh should be par­al­lel to the floor and the back knee should point to­wards the floor. The weight should be evenly dis­trib­uted be­tween both legs. • Push back up, keep­ing the weight on the heel of the front foot.</p>
    <p>• Com­plete reps, then re­peat for the other leg.</p>
    <p>10. SIDE LUNGES (3 sets of 20 reps)</p>
    <p>How to do:</p>
    <p>• Stand with your feet shoul­der-width apart, fac­ing front.</p>
    <p>• Shift your weight to your right leg and lower your body, bend­ing your right knee.</p>
    <p>En­sure your knee is not in front of your toe line and push your butt back.</p>
    <p>• Rais­ing your­self all the way to stand­ing po­si­tion, shift your weight to your left side. • Al­ter­nate back and forth be­tween sides.</p>
