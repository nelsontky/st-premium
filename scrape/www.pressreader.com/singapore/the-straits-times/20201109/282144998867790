    <p>A mother of two was al­ready fac­ing mar­i­tal prob­lems, but the dis­tress she felt was made worse when she had to work from home dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker from April to June.</p>
    <p>Her hus­band was in a job pro­vid­ing an es­sen­tial ser­vice and so kept work­ing at his work­place. But the en­forced iso­la­tion got to her.</p>
    <p>Ms Ng, who de­clined to give her full name, said: “It was made worse as I was con­stantly at home and lacked the hu­man in­ter­ac­tion and dis­trac­tion to di­vert my at­ten­tion (away from my mar­i­tal prob­lems).”</p>
    <p>The trou­bled 38-year-old ex­ec­u­tive, who has two chil­dren aged nine and 12, sought on­line coun­selling in June through the Com­mu­nity Psy­chol­ogy Hub. She found the free on­line ser­vice help­ful.</p>
    <p>Her coun­sel­lor ad­vised her on ways to deal with her mar­i­tal prob­lems and pro­vided her with read­ing ma­te­rial that gave her a bet­ter in­sight into her woes.</p>
    <p>She re­mained anony­mous through the six on­line coun­selling ses­sions, which she pre­ferred given that she was seek­ing help for per­sonal is­sues.</p>
    <p>Ms Ng said she is in a bet­ter emo­tional state now.</p>
    <p>After she sought on­line coun­selling, Ms Ng and her hus­band of 15 years are now see­ing an­other coun­sel­lor to­gether to work through their mar­i­tal is­sues.</p>
    <p>Like Ms Ng, over 900 peo­ple have tapped the Com­mu­nity Psy­chol­ogy Hub On­line Coun­selling ser­vice since it was launched in April. Those seek­ing help are gen­er­ally aged be­tween 20 and 40, and about seven in 10 are women.</p>
    <p>A Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment (MSF) spokesman said: “Our coun­sel­lors have also helped hus­bands who were fac­ing mar­i­tal prob­lems to turn things around and learn how to im­prove their re­la­tion­ships with their wives.”</p>
    <p>The ser­vice is a joint ini­tia­tive be­tween the MSF and the Com­mu­nity Psy­chol­ogy Hub, which pro­vides psy­cho­log­i­cal and re­search ser­vices, to sup­port fam­i­lies fac­ing mar­i­tal, di­vorce or par­ent­ing stresses.</p>
    <p>The on­line coun­selling ser­vice will even­tu­ally be hosted on a yetto-be-named por­tal that will con­sol­i­date in­for­ma­tion and re­sources re­lated to di­vorce – such as hous­ing, fi­nance and le­gal mat­ters – when it is launched.</p>
    <p>The por­tal, tar­geted at those who want help sav­ing their mar­riages or those headed for di­vorce, is ex­pected to be launched late next year.</p>
    <p>Ms Stephanie Wong, a clin­i­cal psy­chol­o­gist at the Com­mu­nity Psy­chol­ogy Hub, said they saw a higher level of stress and anx­i­ety among their clients dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Some were al­ready fac­ing fi­nan­cial stress from pay cuts or job losses or were wor­ried about their job se­cu­rity, on top of the other stresses the Covid-19 pan­demic brought about.</p>
    <p>She added: “The cir­cuit breaker ag­gra­vated mar­i­tal is­sues as peo­ple worked from home and there was less per­sonal space. Bound­aries (be­tween work and home) be­come blurred.</p>
    <p>“Some also strug­gled with work­ing from home and jug­gling their chil­dren’s home-based learn­ing. All these led to in­creased ten­sion and con­flicts among fam­ily mem­bers.”</p>
    <p>What is unique about the coun­selling of­fered is that it is con­ducted through a live chat or email – so peo­ple can seek help with­out leav­ing their homes.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, the coun­selling ser­vices were also of­fered to those who pre­ferred to talk over the phone, Ms Wong said.</p>
    <p>Some of those seek­ing help pre­ferred to re­main anony­mous as they feel they can be more can­did about their sit­u­a­tion, she added.</p>
    <p>More in­for­ma­tion on the Com­mu­nity Psy­chol­ogy Hub On­line Coun­selling ser­vice can be found at www.cphon­linecoun­selling.sg</p>
    <p>You can also call the Na­tional Care Hot­line on 1800-202-6868 if you need psy­cho­log­i­cal and emo­tional sup­port amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
