    <p>NEW YORK • It is likely to be any­one’s game in the women’s field at next week’s US Open, go­ing by the string of up­sets at the Western and South­ern Open.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, Karolina Pliskova and Sofia Kenin, the top two seeds at the hard-court Grand Slam, both crashed out of the fi­nal warm-up event be­fore Flush­ing Mead­ows.</p>
    <p>Twenty-three time Ma­jor cham­pion Ser­ena Wil­liams joined them at the exit door on Tues­day, go­ing down 5-7, 7-6 (7-5), 6-1 to Greek Maria Sakkari in the third round.</p>
    <p>The for­mer world No. 1, who is gun­ning for a record-equalling 24th Slam, was also stunned in the quar­ter-fi­nals of the in­au­gu­ral WTA Top Seed Open al­most two weeks ago.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing not played on the Tour be­fore the Lex­ing­ton tour­na­ment – Fe­bru­ary’s Fed Cup was the last time she com­peted – her sec­ond early exit in as many events comes as a big blow to her prepa­ra­tions for the sec­ond Slam of the year.</p>
    <p>Liken­ing her de­feat to a toxic re­la­tion­ship, Wil­liams, who will be one of the favourites in New York given a dec­i­mated field that has seen the likes of world No. 1 Ash­leigh Barty, Si­mona Halep and de­fend­ing cham­pion Bianca An­dreescu all pull out over Covid-19 fears, said: “I lit­er­ally put my­self in this sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“You know, it’s like dat­ing a guy that you know sucks. That’s lit­er­ally what I keep do­ing out here. It’s like I have got to get rid of this guy. It just makes no sense. It’s frus­trat­ing.</p>
    <p>“It was hard... I had so many op­por­tu­ni­ties to win and I have to fig­ure that one out, like how to start win­ning those matches again. It was tough. There was no ex­cuse.”</p>
    <p>Wil­liams, whose match fit­ness had been ques­tioned, also ad­mit­ted she was also strug­gling with cramps to­wards the end of the match.</p>
    <p>“I started cramp­ing but shouldn’t have been in that sit­u­a­tion,” she added. “I don’t think that helps men­tally.”</p>
    <p>There were, how­ever, no such is­sues for an­other for­mer world No. 1, Naomi Osaka, who blasted eight aces past Dayana Yas­trem­ska of Ukraine in the 6-3, 6-1 vic­tory.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese, who beat Wil­liams in the 2018 US Open fi­nal for her maiden Slam, will be the one to watch when the event starts on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>In the men’s draw, world No. 1 and 17-time Grand Slam cham­pion No­vak Djokovic was barely tested in his third-round match as the Serb sailed past Amer­i­can Ten­nys Sand­gren 6-2, 6-4 .</p>
