    <p>Q: Do dig­i­tal plat­forms use per­sonal data to charge more?</p>
    <p>A: Con­sumers are mak­ing ever greater use of dig­i­tal plat­forms for online shop­ping, ride hail­ing and food de­liv­ery. At the same time, th­ese plat­forms – in­clud­ing Lazada, Grab and Foodpanda – col­lect data about us: Where we live, what de­vices we are us­ing, how much we have pur­chased be­fore and what other apps we are us­ing.</p>
    <p>Do they make use of all this data to charge us more if they think we are less likely to shop around?</p>
    <p>Just be­cause firms can set per­son­alised prices, doesn’t mean they will. An im­por­tant rea­son they may not is the fear of a con­sumer back­lash if caught.</p>
    <p>Fa­mously, in its early days, Ama­zon ex­per­i­mented by charg­ing dif­fer­ent cus­tomers dif­fer­ent prices for the same DVDs. Be­tween Aug 31 and Sept 5, 2000, Ama­zon var­ied the prices on 68 DVDs to test how price changes would af­fect their sales.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately for Ama­zon, cus­tomers com­pared notes. They were out­raged, as­sum­ing that Ama­zon was charg­ing them more based on where they lived or how much they had pur­chased be­fore. “We’ve never tested and we never will test prices based on cus­tomer de­mo­graph­ics,” founder Jeff Be­zos said in a news re­lease at the time.</p>
    <p>Fast for­ward to this year, and some kinds of price dis­crim­i­na­tion do seem to have be­come ac­cepted. One com­mon prac­tice is tar­geted promo codes. Their ac­cep­tance may re­flect that they are framed as dis­counts, and that re­cip­i­ents are aware of the special deals be­ing of­fered.</p>
    <p>An­other com­mon prac­tice is surge pric­ing. Ride-hail­ing op­er­a­tors in­crease the price on a route if de­mand ex­ceeds sup­ply. But be­cause prices can vary for each dif­fer­ent trip, it raises the prospect that th­ese plat­forms could also charge rid­ers more based on the par­tic­u­lar ad­dress they are go­ing to (such as a fine-din­ing restaurant) or the rider’s his­tory (if they al­ways take a cer­tain route us­ing the same plat­form, for ex­am­ple) with­out rid­ers re­al­is­ing.</p>
    <p>To shed light on whether such price dis­crim­i­na­tion does arise, we gath­ered data on De­liv­eroo’s de­liv­ery fee in Sin­ga­pore. This is the fee that De­liv­eroo charges and col­lects from cus­tomers on top of the restaurant’s price when hav­ing food de­liv­ered. We did this in two ways.</p>
    <p>First, we ran seven ran­domised ex­per­i­ments, each vary­ing a dif­fer­ent char­ac­ter­is­tic of in­ter­est. For each experiment, we con­ducted the fol­low­ing ex­er­cise 120 times: 1</p>
    <p>A clean-slate De­liv­eroo ac­count was cre­ated based on pre­de­ter­mined spec­i­fi­ca­tions – sim­u­lat­ing a new user with no past or­ders, us­ing a phone with all prior con­tent and set­tings erased via a fac­tory re­set; 2</p>
    <p>A sam­ple or­der was made from the same food stall based on the same spec­i­fi­ca­tions ex­cept for the char­ac­ter­is­tic of in­ter­est that was ran­domly cho­sen (such as whether the phone type was An­droid or iPhone);</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>The de­liv­ery fee shown was recorded.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, we sur­veyed more than 1,000 De­liv­eroo users, asked them to en­ter a sam­ple or­der and col­lected the cor­re­spond­ing user char­ac­ter­is­tics and de­liv­ery fees.</p>
    <p>What we found was re­mark­ably sim­i­lar across the two ap­proaches. The find­ings show price dif­fer­en­ti­a­tion in Sin­ga­pore by De­liv­eroo based on per­sonal data over the pe­riod of our study (from July to Septem­ber).</p>
    <p>In our ex­per­i­ments, our base­line “user” has an An­droid phone, signed up to De­liv­eroo via e-mail, is 25 years old, with a de­liv­ery dis­tance fixed at 0.7km to an HDB ad­dress, and re­quests a $20.80 or­der. Given ev­ery­thing else is fixed, this phan­tom user re­ceives a de­liv­ery fee of $1.99.</p>
    <p>When the same user in­stead starts with an iPhone, that cus­tomer would some­times get the same $1.99 de­liv­ery fee and some­times a de­liv­ery fee of $2.49. Av­er­ag­ing over all such users, they are charged 12 cents more per or­der for us­ing an iPhone.</p>
    <p>The re­sults from our sur­vey data found iPhone users are charged around 29 cents more per or­der than An­droid phone users, af­ter con­trol­ling for ev­ery­thing else.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, we found sign­ing up to De­liv­eroo by us­ing Face­book or Google ac­counts rather than by e-mail in­creases the de­liv­ery fee by 44 cents and 38 cents re­spec­tively based on the ex­per­i­men­tal re­sults, and 54 cents and 39 cents re­spec­tively based on the anal­y­sis of the sur­vey data.</p>
    <p>Other in­ter­est­ing re­sults are that users be­low 20 or above 60 face lower de­liv­ery fees, users who have other food de­liv­ery apps in­stalled on their phone face lower de­liv­ery fees, those who sub­scribe to and fre­quently read De­liv­eroo’s news­let­ter pay more, and those or­der­ing from pri­vate con­dos or landed houses pay more.</p>
    <p>While the dol­lar amounts in­volved are small, as a per­cent­age of De­liv­eroo’s fee charged they are sig­nif­i­cant. Taken to­gether, they could be quite sub­stan­tial. And yet, with­out the kind of care­ful study we have car­ried out, it would be hard for in­di­vid­ual users to de­tect th­ese small dol­lar dif­fer­ences, es­pe­cially as the dif­fer­ences seem to be ran­domised (for ex­am­ple, in our ex­per­i­ments, the iPhone user only some­times faces a higher price).</p>
    <p>The bottom line is that for at least one dig­i­tal plat­form in Sin­ga­pore, the ev­i­dence points to price dif­fer­en­ti­a­tion for cus­tomers based on their dig­i­tal foot­print.</p>
    <p>This begs the ques­tion: How widespread is this prac­tice in Sin­ga­pore and else­where? While from an eco­nomic ef­fi­ciency per­spec­tive, such prac­tices are not nec­es­sar­ily harm­ful, con­sumers may want to know how their data is be­ing used (es­pe­cially when in some cases, it is used against them).</p>
    <p>Ef­forts were made to get De­liv­eroo’s com­ment on the find­ings, but no re­sponse was avail­able by press time.</p>
    <p>A more thor­ough in­ves­ti­ga­tion by the au­thor­i­ties seems war­ranted. But a word of cau­tion: once the au­thor­i­ties start look­ing, they might not find any­thing. The plat­forms are likely to tweak their al­go­rithms if they are con­cerned about any in­ves­ti­ga­tion and the as­so­ci­ated risk of a con­sumer back­lash. So per­haps by the time you’ve fin­ished read­ing this col­umn, it will be too late to ex­ploit our find­ings for your next food de­liv­ery or­der.</p>
