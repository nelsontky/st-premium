    <p>Malaysia’s largest rul­ing party Umno scored a thump­ing vic­tory with 85 per cent of the votes in yes­ter­day’s by-elec­tion in Slim, trounc­ing former prime min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad’s weeks-old Parti Pe­juang Tanah Air.</p>
    <p>Pe­juang, in its elec­toral de­but, failed to make a dent in Umno’s stronghold of Slim, gar­ner­ing less than 14 per cent of the votes for the Perak state as­sem­bly seat.</p>
    <p>Umno can­di­date Mohd Zaidi Aziz, who con­tested un­der the Barisan Na­sional flag, re­ceived 13,060 votes, soundly de­feat­ing Pe­juang’s Mr Amir Khusyairi Mo­hamad Tanusi, who man­aged only 2,115 votes.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, in­de­pen­dent can­di­date San­tha­rasekaran Subra­ma­niam re­ceived 276 votes.</p>
    <p>Safety pro­ce­dures to curb the spread of the coro­n­avirus were in place at all 12 polling sta­tions, with vot­ers al­lot­ted time slots and re­quired to main­tain so­cial dis­tanc­ing and have their tem­per­a­ture taken.</p>
    <p>Umno had de­fended the seat in the 2018 Gen­eral Elec­tion with 45 per cent of the votes. Yes­ter­day’s wide mar­gin was in part due to the fact that two of its op­po­nents in 2018 are now its al­lies in the Perikatan Na­sional (PN) govern­ment.</p>
    <p>Umno, Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia (PAS) and Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia are all part of the fed­eral govern­ment, as well as the Perak state ad­min­is­tra­tion, af­ter de­fec­tions in Fe­bru­ary led to Tun Dr Ma­hathir be­ing de­posed.</p>
    <p>PAS had in 2018 taken 22 per cent of the votes in Slim, while Ber­satu was backed by a third of vot­ers.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir, 95, formed Pe­juang ear­lier this month along with a handful of Ber­satu lead­ers who re­fused to join hands with Umno.</p>
    <p>The el­der states­man had in the 2018 Gen­eral Elec­tion led the Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) coali­tion, which then in­cluded Ber­satu, to a shock win that ended Umno’s sixdecade rule.</p>
    <p>But Umno’s land­slide vic­tory yes­ter­day in­di­cates that Dr Ma­hathir faces an up­hill bat­tle to re­peat his past suc­cess with Pe­juang, if, as widely spec­u­lated, na­tional polls are called in the next six months.</p>
    <p>Umno pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi said last night the mar­gin of vic­tory showed Umno was gain­ing back the sup­port of those who had turned their backs on the party at the last polls in 2018.</p>
    <p>“This shows the vot­ers have missed us,” he told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“This will be fur­ther re­vealed if the Sabah state elec­tions or GE15 are held,” he said, re­fer­ring to the next gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Three-quarters of the vot­ers in Slim are Malay Mus­lim, who make up the ma­jor­ity in more than half of Malaysia’s par­lia­men­tary con­stituen­cies.</p>
    <p>The re­sults show that most of those who had voted for Ber­satu in 2018, when Dr Ma­hathir was still its chair­man, did not back his new party yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Pe­juang was formed to go up against the three Malay par­ties in PN, but this by-elec­tion has shown it will need a mir­a­cle to mount a cred­i­ble chal­lenge at the next gen­eral elec­tion,” risk con­sul­tancy Bow­erGroupAsi­a’s di­rec­tor Adib Zalkapli told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>This was the third by-elec­tion since Mr Muhyid­din led Ber­satu out of the PH govern­ment, and all three have been won by Umno.</p>
    <p>This was also the only by-elec­tion of the three that saw an op­po­si­tion can­di­date try­ing to win a Malay-ma­jor­ity seat, pro­vid­ing the first real bell­wether of the cru­cial Malay vote.</p>
    <p>Just over two-thirds of the 22,749 reg­is­tered vot­ers in Slim cast their bal­lots yes­ter­day, less than the 81 per cent two years ago, re­flect­ing voter fa­tigue which was ap­par­ent dur­ing the two-week cam­paign.</p>
    <p>If the out­come in Slim is in­dica­tive of the na­tional sen­ti­ment among Malay vot­ers, it would mean that Pe­juang, as well as other op­po­si­tion par­ties, will strug­gle to gal­vanise enough sup­port to un­seat the cur­rent govern­ment.</p>
    <p>UN­DER­WHELM­ING DE­BUT</p>
    <p>Pe­juang was formed to go up against the three Malay par­ties in Perikatan Na­sional, but this by-elec­tion has shown it will need a mir­a­cle to mount a cred­i­ble chal­lenge at the next gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
