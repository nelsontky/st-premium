    <p>HOUSTON • US Women’s Open cham­pion Kim A-lim likes the Cham­pi­ons Golf Club venue so much she said she wants to put up a tent and stay a few more days.</p>
    <p>With two weeks’ quar­an­tine await­ing her back in South Korea, it is no sur­prise she is re­luc­tant to leave Houston.</p>
    <p>Kim, mak­ing her US Women’s Open de­but, ral­lied from a five­stroke deficit in the fi­nal round to seal her first Ma­jor ti­tle with a one-shot vic­tory, ty­ing the record for big­gest come­back in the tour­na­ment’s his­tory. She was the sev­enth player to do so, and the first since An­nika Soren­stam in 1995.</p>
    <p>The 25-year-old’s vic­tory also con­tin­ued her coun­try’s dom­i­na­tion of the tour­na­ment in re­cent years, with nine of the last 13 US Women’s Opens be­ing won by a South Korean golfer.</p>
    <p>Kim said it took her some time to ad­just to the dif­fer­ent con­di­tions at the course.</p>
    <p>“Back home there’s no Ber­muda grass, so it took some time for me to get used to it,” she said.</p>
    <p>“But I love this golf course, love this en­vi­ron­ment. I even said ear­lier I want to ac­tu­ally put a tent up here and stay a few more days.</p>
    <p>“Still can’t re­ally soak in that I’m the cham­pion.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, she ran into trou­ble af­ter she birdied the fi­nal three holes for a four-un­der 67 and a three-un­der 281 to­tal that cat­a­pulted her to her win on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>As she sat in front of a TV in the play­ers’ din­ing area watch­ing the com­peti­tors with a chance to catch her, she fum­bled with her phone, which was vi­brat­ing with mes­sages from fam­ily mem­bers and friends back home in South Korea who had stayed up all night to watch her round.</p>
    <p>The phone fell to the bot­tom of her golf bag and Kim re­moved all</p>
    <p>her clubs to re­trieve it while, one af­ter the other, her chal­lengers fell by the way­side.</p>
    <p>“I’d been eye­ing the leader­board through­out the round and I knew how many shots I was back,” she said. “That’s prob­a­bly the rea­son why I tried to hit more ag­gres­sive, tried to more at­tack the pins.”</p>
    <p>Hi­nako Shi­buno of Ja­pan, the 54-hole leader, could not catch Kim. She had held a one-stroke lead af­ter Sun­day’s fi­nal round was post­poned by in­clement weather, but bo­geyed the penul­ti­mate hole the next day and fin­ished fourth at one-un­der 283 with a clos­ing 74.</p>
    <p>Kim’s com­pa­tri­ots, Park In-bee and world No. 1 Ko Jin-young, both carded the sec­ond-low­est score of the day, 68. Ko was one stroke short of Kim at two-un­der 282, while Park was in a three-way tie for sixth at two-over 286.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can Amy Ol­son, who was play­ing af­ter the sud­den death on Satur­day night of her father-in­law from a heart at­tack, tied for sec­ond with Ko with a 72.</p>
    <p>Kim, who is not a mem­ber of the LPGA, earned US$1 mil­lion (S$1.34 mil­lion) for the vic­tory. She also is el­i­gi­ble for a two-year Tour mem­ber­ship, but said she is not sure if she will join next year.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion would likely re­quire sev­eral ma­jor dis­rup­tions to her life.</p>
    <p>“Once I go back home, I’ll think about it and see.”</p>
