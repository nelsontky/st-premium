    </section>

    <p>It was an or­di­nary week day and 22-year-old Te­sha (not her real name) was pre­par­ing for work. She never made it to work that day. She suf­fered a sud­den car­diac ar­rest and col­lapsed at home.</p>
    <p>Her hus­band called 995 – Sin­ga­pore’s emer­gency ser­vices num­ber – and re­ceived in­struc­tions to start car­diopul­monary re­sus­ci­ta­tion (CPR). When the am­bu­lance paramedics ar­rived, they found her without a pulse be­cause her heart was stuck in an ab­nor­mal rhythm called ven­tric­u­lar fib­ril­la­tion. De­liv­er­ing elec­tric shocks with a de­fib­ril­la­tor, they man­aged to restart it.</p>
    <p>Te­sha was rushed to the hospi­tal. Along the way, her heart stopped another 31 times. At the emer­gency depart­ment, my col­leagues and I had to rely on ad­vanced re­sus­ci­ta­tion tech­niques to sta­bilise her con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>She sur­vived her or­deal and was dis­charged af­ter a week. Later, I found out that Te­sha has a strong fam­ily his­tory of sud­den car­diac death. Her brother died from car­diac ar­rest at the age of 30.</p>
    <p>Twenty years ago, pa­tients like Te­sha had a less than 2 per cent chance of sur­vival. This sad fact mo­ti­vated me to study car­diac ar­rests as a young emer­gency physi­cian more than 20 years ago. Since then, I have evolved into a clin­i­cian sci­en­tist and health ser­vices re­searcher fo­cus­ing on im­prov­ing out­comes for car­diac ar­rest vic­tims.</p>
    <p>Over the last 20 years, re­search and im­ple­men­ta­tion have helped Sin­ga­pore dra­mat­i­cally im­prove sur­vival rates for car­diac ar­rest. We have seen sur­vival for wit­nessed, “shock­able” ar­rests in­crease ten­fold from less than 2 per cent to more than 20 per cent to­day.</p>
    <p>With World Heart Day tak­ing place ear­lier in the week, and Restart-a-Heart cam­paigns hap­pen­ing world­wide this month, it is timely to look at what has hap­pened in terms of treat­ing car­diac ar­rest vic­tims in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion to­day is that car­diac ar­rest is a fa­tal – yet sur­viv­able – con­di­tion. It can oc­cur in any­one and at any time. Al­most 3,000 peo­ple have a sud­den car­diac ar­rest ev­ery year in Sin­ga­pore and car­diac ar­rests kill more peo­ple yearly than cancer, stroke or trauma.</p>
    <p>Yet, the ini­tial treat­ment is fairly sim­ple and ef­fec­tive if de­liv­ered early: CPR and de­fib­ril­la­tion.</p>
    <p>More ad­vanced treat­ments are avail­able, de­liv­ered by am­bu­lance crews and at the hospi­tal, but this is of­ten con­di­tional upon timely ini­tial care.</p>
    <p>Time is the enemy. In the time you take to read this ar­ti­cle, the fate of a sud­den car­diac ar­rest vic­tim is de­cided. Without any in­ter­ven­tion, the chances for sur­vival de­cline by 10 per cent for ev­ery minute that passes. Glob­ally, the av­er­age time taken by an am­bu­lance to re­spond is more than 10 min­utes.</p>
    <p>That means the best chance a vic­tim has to sur­vive is if some­one who has wit­nessed the event (what we call a “by­stander”) starts CPR and uses an au­to­mated ex­ter­nal de­fib­ril­la­tor (AED).</p>
    <p>MUCH PROGRESS MADE</p>
    <p>Com­mu­nity in­ter­ven­tions such as CPR train­ing in schools, dur­ing na­tional ser­vice and through the Dare (Dis­patcher-As­sisted First Re­spon­der) pro­gramme, dis­patcher-as­sisted CPR and the MyRe­spon­der ap­pli­ca­tion (ac­ti­va­tion of vol­un­teer first re­spon­ders with a smart­phone app) have seen Sin­ga­pore’s “by­stander” CPR rates in­crease from 20 per cent to more than 50 per cent to­day.</p>
    <p>We are also see­ing a five­fold in­crease in the use of AEDs through the Save-A-Life pro­gramme and map­ping of pub­lic AEDs.</p>
    <p>Ad­vanced treat­ments by fire­fight­ers and am­bu­lance crews (high-per­for­mance CPR, de­vices to de­liver drugs, open the air­way, and me­chan­i­cal CPR) and at the hospi­tal (cool­ing to pro­tect vi­tal or­gans, open­ing blocked ar­ter­ies, heart-lung by­pass) mean that more than 70 per cent of sur­vivors have good brain func­tion on dis­charge.</p>
    <p>But the cur­rent pan­demic has shown how frag­ile this progress is. We have seen a small de­cline in by­stander CPR rates (10 per cent to 15 per cent). With a highly trans­mis­si­ble virus, there have been concerns about by­stander CPR.</p>
    <p>How­ever, with “hands-only” CPR, low com­mu­nity rates of Covid-19, mask­ing of the pop­u­la­tion and hand hy­giene, the po­ten­tial ben­e­fits of by­stander CPR far out­weigh po­ten­tial harm.</p>
    <p>CHAIN OF SUR­VIVAL</p>
    <p>It takes a sys­tem to save a life. Re­searchers use a con­cept called the “chain of sur­vival” to de­scribe the fact that a well-co­or­di­nated re­sponse is key to sur­vival and there is no sin­gle “magic bul­let”. The key el­e­ments in the chain of sur­vival in­clude: com­mu­nity (early recog­ni­tion of car­diac ar­rest, CPR, AED), dis­patch (early ac­ti­va­tion of the 995 sys­tem, tele­phone CPR in­struc­tions and send­ing ap­pro­pri­ate help), am­bu­lance (early ad­vanced care) and hospi­tal (post-re­sus­ci­ta­tion care).</p>
    <p>Re­search into im­prov­ing sys­tems of care, such as that con­ducted at Sin­ga­pore’s newly es­tab­lished Pre-hospi­tal and Emer­gency Re­search Cen­tre, hosted at Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School, is vi­tal in our ef­forts to save lives.</p>
    <p>I spoke to Te­sha af­ter her dis­charge from hospi­tal and it was a joy to hear that she had re­turned to her nor­mal life. I re­mem­ber how pas­sion­ately she ad­vo­cated for ev­ery­one to learn CPR to save a life.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the truth is that even to­day, most of our car­diac ar­rest vic­tims still do not have as good an out­come as Te­sha. Re­cently, one of my col­leagues, a won­der­ful sur­geon and hu­man be­ing, died in the prime of his life from sud­den car­diac ar­rest af­ter col­laps­ing while run­ning in East Coast Park.</p>
    <p>Yet, many car­diac ar­rest vic­tims can be saved with a lit­tle help from by­standers.</p>
    <p>With an age­ing pop­u­la­tion, the num­bers of car­diac ar­rests are still in­creas­ing ev­ery year. While we are see­ing more sur­vivors ev­ery year, the ma­jor­ity of car­diac ar­rest vic­tims still die. Many could have been saved.</p>
    <p>Each year, we hold a sim­ple cer­e­mony called the Sur­vivor Awards to cel­e­brate the lives saved and the un­sung he­roes – by­standers, 995 staff, paramedics and MyRe­spon­der vol­un­teers – who helped to save them. To­gether, we can snatch vic­tims like Te­sha from the jaws of death and save more lives.</p>
