    <p>BELFAST • Mr John Hume, a key Roman Catholic ar­chi­tect of North­ern Ire­land’s 1998 Good Fri­day peace agree­ment who won the No­bel</p>
    <p>Peace Prize for his role in end­ing 30 years of sec­tar­ian vi­o­lence, died yes­ter­day at the age of 83.</p>
    <p>Mr Hume, a vet­eran civil rights cam­paigner cred­ited with kick­start­ing peace ne­go­ti­a­tions in a Bri­tish re­gion con­vulsed by blood­shed in the early 1990s, shared the</p>
    <p>Peace Prize with North­ern Ire­land’s then-First Min­is­ter David Trim­ble of the Protes­tant Ul­ster Union­ist Party.</p>
    <p>Mr Hume died in a care home in his na­tive Lon­don­derry early yes­ter­day morn­ing, his fam­ily said.</p>
    <p>“John Hume was a po­lit­i­cal titan; a vi­sion­ary who re­fused to be­lieve the fu­ture had to be the same as the past. His con­tri­bu­tion to peace in North­ern Ire­land was epic,” said Mr Tony Blair, who was Bri­tain’s prime min­is­ter at the time of the Good Fri­day ac­cord.</p>
    <p>Mr Hume, in 1968, joined a move­ment to pro­tect the civil rights of the prov­ince’s pro-Ir­ish Roman Catholic mi­nor­ity, fight­ing against dis­crim­i­na­tion by the pro-Bri­tish Protes­tant ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>As leader of the mod­er­ate So­cial Demo­cratic and Labour Party, Mr Hume was an im­por­tant ad­vo­cate of non-vi­o­lence as fight­ing erupted be­tween Ir­ish na­tion­al­ists who wanted a united Ire­land and proBri­tish forces who wanted to main­tain the re­gion’s Bri­tish sta­tus. By 1998, more than 3,600 had died.</p>
    <p>In a key break­through, Mr Hume in 1993 took part in pi­o­neer­ing talks with Mr Gerry Adams, then leader of Sinn Fein, the po­lit­i­cal wing of the guerilla Ir­ish Repub­li­can Army.</p>
    <p>The talks helped pave the way for a joint ini­tia­tive by the Bri­tish and Ir­ish gov­ern­ments in 1993, lead­ing to the Good Fri­day ac­cord.</p>
