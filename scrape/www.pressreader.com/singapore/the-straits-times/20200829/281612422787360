    <p>Spread­ing false­hoods on the hir­ing prac­tices of fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions is unhelpful and un­fair to for­eign­ers who work and con­trib­ute to Sin­ga­pore, the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It was re­spond­ing to queries from The Straits Times on re­cent so­cial me­dia posts tar­get­ing for­eign pro­fes­sion­als at fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions, some of which made false claims and sought to cre­ate ill feel­ings against work­ers from cer­tain back­grounds.</p>
    <p>“We hear the views and con­cerns of Sin­ga­pore­ans who have spo­ken up on the is­sue of lo­cal rep­re­sen­ta­tion in the fi­nan­cial sec­tor,” the cen­tral bank and fi­nan­cial reg­u­la­tor said.</p>
    <p>“But the prop­a­ga­tion of false­hoods by some in­di­vid­u­als is unhelpful for an in­formed dis­cus­sion on th­ese is­sues; not to men­tion, un­fair to the fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions con­cerned as well as to the for­eign­ers who work here and con­trib­ute to Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>MAS said over­all, the pic­ture is a pos­i­tive one for Sin­ga­pore­ans. Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens take up seven out of 10 jobs in the fi­nan­cial ser­vice sec­tor.</p>
    <p>The reg­u­la­tor said that it has been work­ing closely with fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions for many years now to grow a work­force with a strong Sin­ga­porean core. “Th­ese ef­forts have helped to train and de­velop many Sin­ga­porean fi­nance pro­fes­sion­als,” it said.</p>
    <p>“But we need to do more, es­pe­cially un­der the cur­rent economic con­di­tions, to cre­ate more job op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
    <p>MAS said that it is “step­ping up ef­forts to en­sure more di­ver­sity in firms and func­tions, and equal op­por­tu­nity for Sin­ga­pore­ans” and that more de­tails will be shared in the com­ing months of what has been achieved and what more needs to be done.</p>
    <p>“As an in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial cen­tre with global and re­gional func­tions, we will nec­es­sar­ily have an in­ter­na­tional char­ac­ter to the work­force,” MAS said. “But there are ar­eas we can do bet­ter – some func­tions and some firms where there is scope to in­crease the pro­por­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
    <p>Par­tic­u­larly, there is an ur­gent need to build the lo­cal tal­ent pool in tech­nol­ogy-re­lated ar­eas to meet in­creas­ing demand, MAS added.</p>
    <p>It said: “Sin­ga­pore­ans are gen­er­ally do­ing well in the fi­nan­cial sec­tor but MAS would like to see more of them move into the se­nior ranks.”</p>
    <p>The is­sue of hir­ing bias has been a con­cern among pro­fes­sional, man­age­rial and ex­ec­u­tive work­ers in the fi­nan­cial ser­vice sec­tor, more so in a weak labour mar­ket as a re­sult of the Covid-19 pan­demic, and the au­thor­i­ties have been tak­ing mea­sures to en­sure Sin­ga­pore­ans are fairly treated.</p>
    <p>Early this month, the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) an­nounced it had placed an­other 47 em­ploy­ers – of whom 30 were in the fi­nan­cial ser­vice and pro­fes­sional ser­vice sec­tors – on a watch list for po­ten­tially dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, the MOM raised the salary thresh­olds for Em­ploy­ment Passes (EPs), with a higher bar for fi­nan­cial ser­vices, and for S Passes, a move likely to push em­ploy­ers to hire more lo­cal work­ers.</p>
    <p>From next Tues­day, com­pa­nies ap­ply­ing for new EPs for for­eign­ers will need to pay them at least $4,500 a month, up from $3,900 now.</p>
    <p>In the fi­nan­cial ser­vice sec­tor, from Dec 1, new EP hold­ers need to be paid at least $5,000. This is the first time a higher qual­i­fy­ing salary has been set for a spe­cific sec­tor.</p>
    <p>The qual­i­fy­ing salaries for older and more ex­pe­ri­enced work­ers will be re­vised ac­cord­ingly.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to a Straits Times reader’s com­ments on the work­force com­po­si­tion in banks, MAS man­ag­ing direc­tor Ravi Menon said in a let­ter to The Straits Times Forum page pub­lished on Aug 19 that Sin­ga­pore­ans make up 70 per cent of the sec­tor’s work­force and per­ma­nent res­i­dents make up an­other 14 per cent.</p>
    <p>He said that while Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens ac­count for about 70 per cent of se­nior man­age­ment roles in re­tail banks’ lo­cal func­tions, this pro­por­tion is about 43 per cent across the en­tire sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Mr Menon noted this re­flects Sin­ga­pore’s role as an in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial cen­tre. He also said while Sin­ga­pore­ans are well rep­re­sented across busi­ness func­tions, there is a need to im­prove the lo­cal pro­por­tion in ar­eas like tech­nol­ogy and risk man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>The three lo­cal banks, DBS, OCBC and UOB, have said that over 90 per cent of their work­force here are Sin­ga­pore­ans and PRs, while Stan­dard Char­tered has Sin­ga­pore­ans and PRs form­ing 83 per cent of its staff.</p>
    <p>Hu­man re­sources prac­ti­tioner Joanna Yeoh, who has been in the sec­tor for 25 years and took to so­cial me­dia this month to write about how “the scale has been tipped against lo­cals for a while”, said the lat­est move to raise the min­i­mum salary cri­te­ria of for­eign pro­fes­sion­als sends “a strong sig­nal” that the au­thor­i­ties are se­ri­ous about en­sur­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans are given fair ac­cess to job op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Other ob­servers said neg­a­tive sen­ti­ments about for­eign­ers tend to grow in times of un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple face a higher risk of be­ing laid off and may per­ceive for­eign­ers to be competing for jobs, said Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore se­nior eco­nom­ics lec­turer Kelvin Seah.</p>
    <p>In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies se­nior re­search fel­low Mathew Mathews said many Sin­ga­pore­ans are aware of the re­al­ity that a small coun­try like Sin­ga­pore has to at­tract for­eign tal­ent to stay glob­ally com­pet­i­tive.</p>
    <p>“But when economic dif­fi­cul­ties hit home, it is hard to also be sup­port­ive of many for­eign­ers tak­ing up what is per­ceived as the bet­ter jobs,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr David Leong, man­ag­ing direc­tor of hu­man re­sources firm Peo­pleWorld­wide Con­sult­ing, pointed out that many highly paid ex­pa­tri­ates in the fi­nan­cial scene are global work­ers with var­ied ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>He added: “I am cer­tain Sin­ga­pore­ans can have the same op­por­tu­ni­ties for such roles but they must be will­ing to be im­mersed over­seas for those ex­pe­ri­ences.”</p>

        <p data-role="text">Pho&#xAD;tos pur&#xAD;port&#xAD;edly claim&#xAD;ing to be taken in a DBS Bank of&#xAD;fice here but which showed a large num&#xAD;ber of non-Sin&#xAD;ga&#xAD;porean work&#xAD;ers made their way onto chat groups and so&#xAD;cial me&#xAD;dia plat&#xAD;forms (above). When con&#xAD;tacted and asked by ST if he had made an ef&#xAD;fort to ver&#xAD;ify the source of the im&#xAD;age, ne&#xAD;ti&#xAD;zen Den&#xAD;nis Lim asked why he should do such checks.&#xD;&#xA;The claims were de&#xAD;bunked by the bank, which clar&#xAD;i&#xAD;fied in a Face&#xAD;book post (be&#xAD;low) on Aug 15 that the images were from its of&#xAD;fice in In&#xAD;dia.</p>
