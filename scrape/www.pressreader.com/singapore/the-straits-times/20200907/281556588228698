    <p>Nearly 70 years af­ter she was given up for adop­tion, Madam Jenny Chow fi­nally re­united with her bi­o­log­i­cal sib­lings yes­ter­day. The re­u­nion was the first time that the 67-year-old Madam Chow, who was given up for adop­tion when she was three months old, met seven of her eight bi­o­log­i­cal sib­lings.</p>
    <p>Some 67 years af­ter she was given up for adop­tion, Madam Jenny Chow fi­nally re­united with her bi­o­log­i­cal sib­lings yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The re­u­nion, which took place at Block 516 Be­dok North Av­enue 2, was the first time Madam Chow, 67, met seven of her eight bi­o­log­i­cal sib­lings. The fam­ily lost con­tact with the last sib­ling decades ago.</p>
    <p>Born Lua Siew Hong, Madam Chow was given up for adop­tion when she was three months old.</p>
    <p>She grew up as the only child of Mr Chow Xiang Cheow and Madam Tan Ah Bee.</p>
    <p>She was in pri­mary school when she found out that she was an adopted child – she saw her birth cer­tifi­cate, which had the names of her bi­o­log­i­cal par­ents, and the adop­tion doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>But she did not pur­sue the mat­ter as she was afraid her adop­tive par­ents would be hurt, she said.</p>
    <p>She started mak­ing at­tempts to search for her bi­o­log­i­cal fam­ily only in 2004, in­clud­ing search­ing for their home, but to no avail.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s meet­ing came about af­ter her hus­band, Mr David Wong, 68, who owns a print­ing busi­ness, con­tacted Crime Li­brary last month to help find the fam­ily, at a friend’s sug­ges­tion.</p>
    <p>The vol­un­teer group also tracks down miss­ing peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Madam Chow met five of her sib­lings – three sis­ters and two brothers – at the void deck of the Hous­ing Board block, where they com­pared birth cer­tifi­cates. She was also given pho­tos of the fam­ily. An­other sis­ter and an­other brother joined them later at a nearby cof­fee shop, where the fam­ily had lunch to­gether.</p>
    <p>Madam Chow, who works part­time in ho­tel ad­min­is­tra­tion, told The Straits Times that she was a bit stressed dur­ing the re­u­nion as she grew up as an only child.</p>
    <p>She and her hus­band now have two chil­dren and six grand­chil­dren. They had a third child who has since died.</p>

    <p>Madam Jenny Chow, who works part-time in ho­tel ad­min­is­tra­tion, told</p>
    <p>The Straits Times that she was a bit stressed dur­ing the re­u­nion as she grew up as an only child.</p>
    <p>She and her hus­band now have two chil­dren and six grand­chil­dren. They had a third child who has since died.</p>
    <p>Man­darin that she was happy to be re­united with her sis­ter and hoped to keep in touch with her.</p>
    <p>Mr Joseph Tan, who founded Crime Li­brary, said the or­gan­i­sa­tion had made in­quiries around the neigh­bour­hood in Changi. That was where the fam­ily used to live, ac­cord­ing to the ad­dress on Madam Chow’s birth cer­tifi­cate.</p>
    <p>Crime Li­brary found out that Madam Chow’s late bi­o­log­i­cal mother used to work at Changi Air­port and later man­aged to find her house. It is now in­hab­ited by two of Madam Chow’s brothers, one of whom con­firmed with Crime Li­brary that she was their long-lost sis­ter.</p>
    <p>“We are happy that both fam­i­lies fi­nally have clo­sure, and that Crime Li­brary is here for them,” Mr Tan said.</p>
