    <p>Why did we fall for him? Skill, of course, but also be­cause he seemed so hu­man a cham­pion, not re­mote, but real. He bat­tled life – poverty, weight, ad­dic­tion, pres­sure – and yet also rose above it. He was not any­one’s ver­sion of a role model, nor some suited brand, just fallible and fab­u­lous all at once. He flew and fell.</p>
    <p>As a young man in Kolkata in the late 1980s, my friends and I man­aged to get our hands on a video­tape of Hero, the of­fi­cial film of the 1986 World Cup. Maradona’s com­plex­ity as a man was yet to fully emerge, and we were novice writ­ers be­witched by this booted man. We watched him so of­ten that we wore out the video­tape. But mem­ory of magic is al­ways be­yond era­sure.</p>
    <p>If we didn’t have time for the whole film, we pressed for­ward wind till we came to the goal. That goal. The one which is an 11-sec­ond hymn to skill and a roughly 60m run into im­mor­tal­ity. The goal that comes four min­utes af­ter the Hand Of God and is the Left Foot Of Ge­nius. Some­times, you wish the ball could tell the full story of ev­ery spin, nudge, idea and ca­ress.</p>
    <p>The goal was scored on June 22, 1986, af­ter 55 min­utes in Es­ta­dio Azteca in Mex­ico City in front of over 100,000 fans. Pas­tors have preached on that ground, a Bea­tle (Paul McCart­ney) has played there, but Maradona had his own faith­ful.</p>
    <p>The goal was mock­ery and mad­ness, it was a nose thumbed at Eng­land af­ter the open­ing goal (an im­prob­a­ble sec­ond af­ter the im­moral­ity of the first), it was power, speed, chutz­pah. It was a goal that changed us for we did not know that this could be done. Maradona was an orig­i­nal.</p>
    <p>How many times have you seen the goal? In the last year? In your life? Do you watch it just for fun or to in­tro­duce a child to it or to con­sider the IQ of his toes? The in­vis­i­ble cor­ri­dor on the field he runs down made me think of him hurtling down the tight lanes of his child­hood, hold­ing the ball close.</p>
    <p>Is there any­thing in sport, any act of skill, any McEn­roe vol­ley, Co­maneci rou­tine, Louga­nis dive, Jor­dan bas­ket that you re­visit so of­ten on YouTube? Has any sin­gle sport­ing act so fe­ro­ciously em­bed­ded it­self in your mem­ory? The goal has a grip on us.</p>
    <p>Once in a while, we all bring up Getafe and Lionel Messi as a com­par­i­son, and that is just us be­ing silly. It is a fake con­test. Messi is divine, but Getafe are not Eng­land and the Span­ish league is not the World Cup. Great goals are about places and oc­ca­sions and ri­vals and bit­ter his­to­ries, which are what give them their weight. One English tabloid had car­ried a suit­ably sub­tle head­line be­fore the match: “It’s war, Senor”.</p>
    <p>The goal is sig­nif­i­cant be­cause Maradona has gone at 60 and foot­ball weeps. You, too? We are shaken and grate­ful, un­sur­prised at his early death, and yet moved. Few sto­ries in sport were so full of pain and yet streaked with such un­for­get­table per­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Maradona of­ten got it wrong ex­cept when his feet met the ball, and then for 90 min­utes he was our trans­porter to a for­eign field. He had the low cen­tre of grav­ity of a gym­nast and the ac­cel­er­a­tion of some­thing wild, hun­gry and four-legged. Else­where, life trapped him or he tripped him­self, but here, he was free and in flow.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery now and then – and again yes­ter­day – peo­ple for­ward a clip of him, just 2min 20sec long, warm­ing up for a game, his laces un­done. He is play­ing with the ball, danc­ing re­ally, as the band Opus sings Live Is Life, and this was the best part of Maradona, the joy­ous, ca­sual, ex­pres­sive kid.</p>
    <p>Small things about him will stay for­ever. The pho­to­graph of a posse of six Bel­gians con­fronting him in 1982. His drib­ble past a tribe of Brazil­ians and then a threaded pass to Clau­dio Canig­gia in 1990. In be­tween, he kicked a Brazil­ian in 1982 and was sent off. Maradona had never met the half-mea­sure.</p>
    <p>Why did we fall for him? Skill, of course, but also be­cause he seemed so hu­man a cham­pion, not re­mote, but real. He bat­tled life – poverty, weight, ad­dic­tion, pres­sure – and yet also rose above it. He was not any­one’s ver­sion of a role model, nor some suited brand, just fallible and fab­u­lous all at once. He flew and fell.</p>
    <p>His story has many un­seemly chap­ters and he did not age well, like an old un­cle who makes you wince. But this is pre­cisely why that goal is im­por­tant. Be­cause it is his great gift to us, a moment for us to carry, to trea­sure, to pass on. And to re­mind us for­ever of the prom­ise of this man.</p>
    <p>The Hand Of God was some­thing that had never hap­pened in foot­ball. It was quick think­ing, and how he did it, putting his hand close to his head… some may say it was not pure sports­man­ship or what­ever, but hey, that is ’’ Maradona.</p>

    <p>He was very quick, and had a very low cen­tre of grav­ity. It was very dif­fi­cult to push him off the ball... ’’ he just would not go down.</p>
