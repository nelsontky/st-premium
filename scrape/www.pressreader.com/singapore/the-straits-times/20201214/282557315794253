    <p>HOUS­TON • Hi­nako Shi­buno said on Satur­day she is learn­ing to live with the overnight celebrity she gained af­ter com­ing from nowhere to win last year’s Women’s Bri­tish Open in her first LPGA event.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese, who is known for her solid all-round game and mag­netic per­son­al­ity, was dubbed the “Smil­ing Cin­derella” af­ter her break­through vic­tory, which cat­a­pulted her to fame in her coun­try and be­yond.</p>
    <p>The 22-year-old said the at­ten­tion that came from her TV ap­pear­ances has not im­pacted her play but did re­quire an ad­just­ment on a per­sonal level.</p>
    <p>“Ap­pear­ing on the TV shows and stuff like that does not af­fect my golf per­for­mance at all,” she said af­ter the third round of the US Women’s Open, where she held a one stroke lead. She had carded a third-round three-over 74 to fin­ish four-un­der 209.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, once I be­came a celebrity, and (with) celebrity sta­tus, it makes it dif­fi­cult to be my­self. So just re­cently I was able to get rid of my shell, so to speak, so that I can be my­self again.”</p>
    <p>The lack of at­ten­tion might ac­tu­ally have been hin­der­ing her at the year’s fi­nal Ma­jor, where no fans are al­lowed at Hous­ton’s Cham­pi­ons Golf Club due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“When I won the Ma­jor, there was a large num­ber of peo­ple out in front of me be­cause of the au­di­ence. That gave me power and it’s easy for me to get the mo­men­tum as well. Now there’s no peo­ple, no au­di­ence and it’s very dif­fi­cult for me to get any mo­men­tum, be­cause when I get a run of birdies, when I get the birdie, it’s si­lence.”</p>
    <p>If she can hold on for the win, it will be any­thing but silent in Ja­pan and she can ex­pect the spot­light to in­ten­sify. Aside from Shi­buno, the only Ja­panese to win a Ma­jor was Hisako “Chako” Higuchi in 1977.</p>
    <p>The world No. 16 led Amer­i­can Amy Ol­son (71) by a stroke af­ter 54 holes. South Korean Kim Ji-yeong (67) and Thai Moriya Ju­tanu­garn (72) are a fur­ther three shots back.</p>
