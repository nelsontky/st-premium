    <p>The other day, I came across an ar­ti­cle that asked: “What does death mean?” (What is death? Lessons from a pan­demic, Dec 21?).</p>
    <p>And as I read through the ar­ti­cle, I started to pon­der: What does “be­ing alive” mean? Does be­ing alive mean be­ing able to feel; to feel the rush of adren­a­line pul­sat­ing through my body as I sit on a roller coaster, the fear as I face a ma­jor turn­ing point in life, the empti­ness as I lose a loved one and the com­pas­sion to­wards an in­jured an­i­mal?</p>
    <p>Or does be­ing alive per­haps mean achiev­ing, ac­com­plish­ing, earn­ing, get­ting?</p>
    <p>Is liv­ing, breath­ing, be­ing and ex­ist­ing re­ally based on whether my heart is pound­ing?</p>
    <p>Some be­lieve that “be­ing alive” means to achieve as much as they can and strive for their best.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers be­lieve that “be­ing alive” means to love, to show kind­ness and to truly live for oth­ers.</p>
    <p>As of now, I feel that “be­ing alive” means feel­ing, in­flu­enc­ing, lov­ing, learn­ing and, most im­por­tantly, be­ing. But as I age,</p>
    <p>I’m sure that my thoughts will change. Af­ter all, learn­ing is a part of “be­ing alive”.</p>
