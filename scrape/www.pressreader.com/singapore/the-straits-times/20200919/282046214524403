    <p>A bus driver, who be­lieved that his wife of 28 years was hav­ing an af­fair and stabbed her to death, was sen­tenced to 10 years’ jail by the High Court yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Kr­ish­nan Raju, 53, pleaded guilty in July to a charge of cul­pa­ble homi­cide for killing Madam Raithena Vaithena Samy, 44, on the night of Oct 26, 2017, at their Loyang Gar­dens con­do­minium.</p>
    <p>He was orig­i­nally charged with mur­der for the killing, in which he in­flicted 13 stab wounds on his wife, in­clud­ing five to the ch­est that were fa­tal.</p>
    <p>The charge was re­duced af­ter an In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health psy­chi­a­trist di­ag­nosed him with a type of delu­sional dis­or­der known as mor­bid jeal­ousy, in which the suf­ferer is pre­oc­cu­pied with the thought that his spouse is un­faith­ful, with­out any real proof.</p>
    <p>Kr­ish­nan was so pre­oc­cu­pied with thoughts of his wife’s un­faith­ful­ness that he could not cope with his job and started drink­ing heav­ily in the weeks lead­ing up to the killing.</p>
    <p>In sen­tenc­ing, Jus­tice Hoo Sheau Peng said that while the at­tack was largely un­pro­voked by the vic­tim, it was not pre­med­i­tated.</p>
    <p>She noted that the at­tack was trig­gered af­ter Kr­ish­nan lis­tened to an au­dio record­ing of one of his wife’s con­ver­sa­tions, which he be­lieved con­firmed his sus­pi­cions about her in­fi­delity.</p>
    <p>The judge said Kr­ish­nan’s self-in­tox­i­ca­tion and his fail­ure to seek help af­ter he stabbed his wife were fac­tors that ag­gra­vated his of­fence.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she ac­cepted that he was re­morse­ful and had sur­ren­dered to the au­thor­i­ties the next day.</p>
    <p>The court heard ear­lier that Kr­ish­nan had been very pos­ses­sive of Madam Raithena, an op­er­a­tions ex­ec­u­tive. Fam­ily mem­bers, in­clud­ing their two chil­dren, aged 22 and 20, no­ticed that he kept tabs on her where­abouts.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple’s re­la­tion­ship started break­ing down in De­cem­ber 2016.</p>
    <p>Kr­ish­nan felt her at­ti­tude to­wards him had changed. He claimed she of­ten came home late in a drunken state and made ex­cuses not to have sex with him. He be­gan stalk­ing her, and once showed up at the ho­tel she was stay­ing at when she went to Me­laka for a com­pany event.</p>
    <p>He checked her phone and un­der­wear, and, in front of other fam­ily mem­bers, ac­cused her of cheat­ing on him, which led her to ask for a di­vorce.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing an ar­gu­ment in Oc­to­ber 2017, when he threat­ened sui­cide, Madam Raithena moved out of the mas­ter bed­room to sleep in her daugh­ter’s room.</p>
    <p>Kr­ish­nan then planted an au­dio record­ing de­vice in that room to lis­ten to his wife’s con­ver­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>On the night of the killing, Kr­ish­nan started drink­ing as he lis­tened to a record­ing in which he heard his wife laugh and men­tion a man’s name, “Sar­a­vanan”.</p>
    <p>He be­lieved she was laugh­ing at him and sus­pected that she was hav­ing an af­fair with Sar­a­vanan.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Madam Raithena re­turned home from work and went to take a shower, he barged into the bath­room and stabbed her with a kitchen knife.</p>
    <p>He dragged her out to lis­ten to the au­dio clip, and when she strug­gled and begged him to stop, he stabbed her re­peat­edly and grabbed her neck un­til she stopped mov­ing.</p>
    <p>Kr­ish­nan left the flat and fled to Jo­hor Baru, where he stayed with his el­der brother.</p>
    <p>His daugh­ter and nephew found Madam Raithena’s body at about mid­night.</p>
    <p>Kr­ish­nan re­turned to Sin­ga­pore the next morn­ing and sur­ren­dered him­self.</p>
    <p>Po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions re­vealed that Madam Raithena had been hav­ing an af­fair with a male col­league from Novem­ber 2016, but none of her fam­ily mem­bers or friends knew about it.</p>
    <p>Deputy Public Pros­e­cu­tor Li Yi­hong had sought 12 years’ jail, while de­fence coun­sel Kal­i­dass Mu­ru­gaiyan asked for eight years.</p>
