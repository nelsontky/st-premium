    <p>DELAWARE • LVMH coun­ter­sued Tif­fany & Co on Mon­day, ar­gu­ing that the iconic United States jew­eller’s fi­nan­cial mis­man­age­ment in the pan­demic per­mit­ted the French lux­ury goods gi­ant to walk away from its pro­posed US$16 bil­lion (S$22 bil­lion) ac­qui­si­tion of the com­pany.</p>
    <p>The move comes after Tif­fany sued LVMH ear­lier this month, ob­ject­ing to the Paris-based com­pany’s de­ci­sion not to go through with the deal they signed last Novem­ber be­cause of a French govern­ment re­quest and the im­pact of the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>In its coun­ter­claims filed in Delaware Chancery Court on Mon­day, LVMH said the agree­ment with Tif­fany had no carve-out for pan­demics un­der the def­i­ni­tion of a so-called ma­te­rial ad­verse ef­fect. As a re­sult, Tif­fany as­sumed the risk of a virus out­break, LVMH added.</p>
    <p>The French com­pany also said Tif­fany breached its agree­ment to op­er­ate as usual by pay­ing out the high­est pos­si­ble div­i­dend.</p>
    <p>LVMH said it could not close the deal with Tif­fany be­cause it re­ceived a let­ter from the French govern­ment ask­ing the con­glom­er­ate to de­lay the trans­ac­tion un­til next year, beyond the Nov 24 con­trac­tual dead­line the com­pa­nies had agreed to.</p>
    <p>Tif­fany did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment. It has dis­puted LVMH’s as­ser­tion that the French govern­ment in­ter­ven­tion pre­vented it from clos­ing the deal and that a ma­te­rial ad­verse ef­fect had oc­curred. It also de­fended its abil­ity to pay out div­i­dends un­der its con­tract with LVMH.</p>
    <p>LVMH also said Tif­fany stands to profit “far more” if the deal pro­ceeds than as a stand­alone com­pany.</p>
    <p>Tif­fany’s top five ex­ec­u­tives are in line to re­ceive at least US$100 mil­lion in to­tal com­pen­sa­tion if the deal moves for­ward, ac­cord­ing to the coun­ter­claims.</p>
    <p>A US judge last week set a four-day trial on the case begin­ning on Jan 5.</p>
    <p>The judge said dur­ing a hear­ing that he hoped Tif­fany and LVMH could have “pro­duc­tive dis­cus­sions to avoid the need for lit­i­ga­tion”, re­fer­ring to a po­ten­tial set­tle­ment.</p>
    <p>The let­ter that LVMH says pre­vents it from com­plet­ing the deal was signed by France’s For­eign Min­is­ter, who said his of­fice had re­ceived an in­quiry from LVMH and that it was nat­u­ral for him to re­spond with ad­vice.</p>
    <p>LVMH in its coun­ter­claim said the let­ter is a manda­tory di­rec­tive to take part in France’s ef­forts to de­fend its na­tional in­ter­ests in a trade dis­pute with the US.</p>
