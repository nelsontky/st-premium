    <p>Rod­ney Seow loved fast cars and the thrill of racing and made his­tory by win­ning the 1967 Sin­ga­pore Grand Prix, but among his great­est traits was his hu­mil­ity.</p>
    <p>The 85-year-old, who was a fa­mil­iar and fa­mous face in the lo­cal mo­tor sports cir­cuit, died last Friday. The Straits Times un­der­stands that his death was due to nat­u­ral causes. He leaves be­hind his wife Eve­lyn, six chil­dren and eight grand­chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Fel­low former racing car driver William Lyou, who at­tended the wake last Satur­day night, paid trib­ute to his friend and said one of his fond­est mem­o­ries was watch­ing Seow tri­umph in 1967 at the old Thom­son Road Cir­cuit.</p>
    <p>Seow’s vic­tory re­mains the last time a Sin­ga­porean has won the Sin­ga­pore Grand Prix. The an­nual race was dis­con­tin­ued af­ter 1973 be­fore it re­turned as part of the For­mula One World Cham­pi­onship in 2008 and moved to the Ma­rina Bay Street Cir­cuit.</p>
    <p>Lyou, 72, who quit racing in 1973, said Seow was an in­spi­ra­tion to other lo­cal driv­ers. He added: “He was a good driver who was in­spir­ing and down-to-earth. He was gen­uine and never boast­ful. I’m glad to have learnt all th­ese at­tributes from him.</p>
    <p>“Mo­tor racing is a sport that you have to re­ally put your ded­i­ca­tion into to do well and that’s what he did. Even af­ter he stopped racing, he con­trib­uted to so­ci­ety as well.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter Seow called time on his racing ca­reer in 1968, he ran a car as­sem­bly plant in Jo­hor where he hired work­ers di­rectly from trade school and de­vel­oped their skills.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with Esquire Sin­ga­pore in 2014, he said build­ing the plant was his big­gest ac­com­plish­ment and was more im­por­tant than any­thing he had achieved in his racing ca­reer.</p>
    <p>Former Sin­ga­pore Mo­tor Sports As­so­ci­a­tion (now known as Mo­tor Sports Sin­ga­pore) pres­i­dent Harold Netto was the chief course mar­shal at the 1967 race where he watched Seow win.</p>
    <p>“He’s a very good driver as he could over­take peo­ple even along nar­row roads in the cir­cuit,” said Netto, 79. “A lot of younger peo­ple used to go to him and ask how to get into racing. He’s not some­one who would chase them away. He used to sit down and give them ad­vice.”</p>
    <p>In 2012, Seow at­tended an F1 event here along­side Bri­tish star Lewis Hamil­ton, now a six-time world cham­pion. The lat­ter pre­sented Seow with a cus­tomised John­nie Walker race hel­met, in recog­ni­tion of Seow’s con­tri­bu­tions to Sin­ga­pore’s racing scene.</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton said then: “I have a huge amount of re­spect for driv­ers like him. He raced dur­ing a ‘dan­ger­ous’ time, when there weren’t the kind of safety mea­sures there are now.”</p>
    <p>Veteran lo­cal racing driver Ringo</p>
    <p>Chong, 53, of­fered his con­do­lences to Seow’s fam­ily and hailed Seow as “one of the racing greats in Sin­ga­pore”, de­scrib­ing him as “a very hum­ble and quiet man like all true heroes from the ear­lier days”.</p>
