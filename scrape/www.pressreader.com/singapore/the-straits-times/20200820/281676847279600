    <p>The pro­longed Covid-19 pan­demic is likely to have a long-term ef­fect on men­tal health, as stress lev­els rise with the un­cer­tainty of the out­break as well as the eco­nomic down­turn it brings, ex­perts have warned.</p>
    <p>Dr Cor­nelia Chee, head of the depart­ment of psy­cho­log­i­cal medicine at the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore and the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity Hospi­tal, said that when it comes to Sin­ga­pore’s re­sponse to the Covid-19 pan­demic, the “honey­moon” phase is long over.</p>
    <p>That was from Jan­uary to endMarch, when the var­i­ous task forces and health­care ser­vices were ac­ti­vated, and com­mu­nity and im­ported case trans­mis­sion ap­peared to be well con­tained by ro­bust public health mea­sures, she said.</p>
    <p>“In the hos­pi­tals, morale was rel­a­tively high be­cause we could see that health­care work­ers were not get­ting in­fected, un­like dur­ing the Sars out­break,” said Dr Chee, re­fer­ring to the se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is now in the dis­il­lu­sion­ment phase, and more cases of anx­i­ety and de­pres­sion can be ex­pected in the com­ing months, Dr Chee said.</p>
    <p>“We cer­tainly en­tered it i n March as the dorm work­ers’ cases in­creased and it was be­com­ing ob­vi­ous that our over­all eco­nomic re­cov­ery was de­pen­dent not only on our abil­ity to con­tain our im­ported and lo­cally trans­mit­ted cases, but on how well other coun­tries man­aged their out­breaks and re­sponses too,” said Dr Chee.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had more than 56,000 coro­n­avirus cases and 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Dr Chee said Sin­ga­pore’s re­cov­ery phase – which comes after the dis­il­lu­sion­ment phase – will get un­der way here when there is pan­demic con­trol and eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>At the mo­ment, this phase seems to hinge on the avail­abil­ity of a safe, ef­fec­tive and well-dis­trib­uted vac­cine, she said.</p>
    <p>These phases were orig­i­nally de­scribed in a man­ual by the Sub­stance Abuse And Men­tal Health Ser­vices Ad­min­is­tra­tion in the United States for health work­ers help­ing vic­tims dur­ing a dis­as­ter, such as a hur­ri­cane or ter­ror­ist at­tack.</p>
    <p>The Sa­mar­i­tans of Sin­ga­pore (SOS) chief ex­ec­u­tive Gasper Tan said: “With­out a clear in­di­ca­tion of when the sit­u­a­tion will im­prove, the pro­longed ex­po­sure to these stres­sors and the im­pact of the pan­demic may take a toll on one’s men­tal health.”</p>
    <p>These may then lead to pro­nounced feel­ings of worth­less­ness and help­less­ness, he said.</p>
    <p>SOS started a text mes­sag­ing­based ser­vice last month, some three months ahead of its planned launch, to help ad­dress some of the men­tal health needs in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Data on in­creased men­tal health cases due to the pan­demic may not be avail­able yet, but calls to help hot­lines have risen.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, calls to the SOS hot­line rose from 3,826 in March to 4,319 in</p>
    <p>TOLL ON MEN­TAL HEALTH</p>
    <p>With­out a clear in­di­ca­tion of when the sit­u­a­tion will im­prove, the pro­longed ex­po­sure to these stres­sors and the im­pact of the pan­demic may take a toll on one’s men­tal health.</p>

    <p>SA­MAR­I­TANS OF SIN­GA­PORE CHIEF EX­EC­U­TIVE</p>
    <p>GASPER TAN, on the pan­demic’s ef­fects.</p>
    <p>April and 4,265 in May.</p>
    <p>The April and May fig­ures are about 30 per cent to 35 per cent higher than a year ago.</p>
    <p>June saw fewer calls logged – 3,831 – but this is still higher than the 2,863 calls in the same month a year ago.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Care Hot­line, which was launched in April to pro­vide emo­tional and psy­cho­log­i­cal sup­port to those fac­ing dif­fi­cul­ties dur­ing the pan­demic, has re­ceived 26,000 calls.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment (MSF), which op­er­ates the hot­line that is manned by trained vol­un­teers, said the ma­jor­ity of the callers are above age 21.</p>
    <p>Their top con­cerns in­clude “men­tal health, mar­i­tal and fam­ily is­sues, emo­tional sup­port needed and fi­nan­cial or em­ploy­ment wor­ries”.</p>
    <p>Dr Goh Kah Hong, head and se­nior con­sul­tant of psy­cho­log­i­cal medicine at Khoo Teck Puat Hospi­tal, said his depart­ment is see­ing higher de­mand for its ser­vices.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple are seek­ing help now be­cause what they would have usu­ally put up with has be­come too over­whelm­ing to just bot­tle up.”</p>
    <p>He ex­pects the pan­demic to have a “long tail” be­cause of the ram­i­fi­ca­tions of pro­longed stress and so­cial iso­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“With so much un­cer­tainty sur­round­ing the pan­demic, it is hard to pre­dict how long peo­ple will con­tinue to strug­gle when it wraps up,” he said.</p>
    <p>MSF chief psy­chol­o­gist Vivi­enne Ng said that apart from some peo­ple who may ex­pe­ri­ence psy­cho­log­i­cal dis­tress, there are also vul­ner­a­ble groups such as those with dis­abil­i­ties, peo­ple with men­tal health needs and the el­derly, who may be iso­lated at home and need ad­di­tional emo­tional sup­port and ac­cess to spe­cialised ser­vices.</p>
    <p>“In­di­vid­u­als with fi­nan­cial prob­lems and/or who are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing un­em­ploy­ment, as well as those with car­ing re­spon­si­bil­i­ties for young chil­dren, the el­derly or in­di­vid­u­als with spe­cial needs may also feel ad­di­tional stress dur­ing this pe­riod.”</p>
    <p>She ad­vises peo­ple to talk to friends or fam­ily if they feel dis­tressed.</p>
    <p>“If you find your­self not able to func­tion daily – hav­ing a poor ap­petite or be­ing un­able to sleep prop­erly or con­cen­trate, in low mood, for in­stance – please seek help early from a men­tal health prac­ti­tioner,” she said.</p>
