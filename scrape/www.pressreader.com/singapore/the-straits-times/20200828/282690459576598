    <p>LON­DON • Land­ing the role of Bri­tish Se­cret Ser­vice agent, James Bond, also known as 007, would be a dream come true for many ac­tors.</p>
    <p>Not Dev Pa­tel. The 30-year-old English ac­tor (right) said that he is not in­ter­ested in tak­ing on the role, as he does not want to be a “to­kenis­tic” di­ver­sity hire.</p>
    <p>Known for roles in films such as Lion (2016) and The Best Ex­otic Marigold Ho­tel (2011), Pa­tel has been a fan favourite to take on the Bond man­tle, with an en­tire thread on on­line forum Red­dit on why he would be the per­fect choice.</p>
    <p>But, in an in­ter­view with IndieWire on Tues­day, Pa­tel said his vote for the next Bond goes to Idris Elba.</p>
    <p>“I mean, you don’t want me blast­ing through a door with a Walther PPK to try to save you. I’ll do the com­edy ver­sion with Ar­mando,” he joked, re­fer­ring to film-maker Ar­mando Ian­nucci, who re­cently cast Pa­tel as the ti­tle char­ac­ter in the Charles Dickens adap­ta­tion The Per­sonal History of David Cop­per­field.</p>
    <p>He added: “I also don’t want to be gifted a role just be­cause of the to­kenis­tic na­ture of me be­ing a gar­nish – ‘let’s sprin­kle some di­ver­sity into this!’ That doesn’t make me feel good ei­ther.”</p>
    <p>For Pa­tel, “if it works for the story and I feel like I can bring some truth out of this role or em­body it well, then that’s what it should come down to”.</p>
    <p>Cur­rent Bond Daniel Craig has been play­ing the role since 2006’s Casino Royale, tak­ing over from Pierce Bros­nan.</p>
    <p>How­ever, 52-year-old Craig says No Time To Die – slated for re­lease in Novem­ber – will be his fifth and fi­nal out­ing as the Bri­tish spy.</p>
    <p>While pro­duc­ers have kept mum on who the next 007 will be, spec­u­la­tion is rife that the role may be given to a non-white ac­tor for the first time.</p>
