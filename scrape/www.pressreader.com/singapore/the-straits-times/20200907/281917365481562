    <p>Armed po­lice sup­port­ers and anti-racism d e mo n s t r a t o r s clashed in Louisville be­fore the Ken­tucky Derby horse race, while Rochester po­lice used tear gas to dis­perse pro­test­ers, as dis­cord in cities across the US con­tin­ues to sim­mer.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers in Port­land, Ore­gon, threw fire bombs at po­lice last Sat­ur­day night and at least one per­son was in­jured, po­lice said, on the 100th day of demon­stra­tions in the West Coast city over racial in­jus­tice and po­lice bru­tal­ity.</p>
    <p>In the af­ter­noon, hun­dreds of pro­test­ers marched to­wards the Churchill Downs track in Louisville chant­ing, “No Jus­tice, No Derby” – a nod to ac­tivists’ calls to can­cel the an­nual race, which was be­ing held with­out spec­ta­tors be­cause of the coron­avirus.</p>
    <p>Separately, roughly 250 mem­bers of a black mili­tia group named NFAC that has protested against the po­lice killings of black peo­ple as­sem­bled out­side Churchill Downs, all armed with long guns.</p>
    <p>NFAC leader John “Grand­mas­ter Jay” John­son taunted the of­fi­cers stand­ing guard in front of the race track, but the group later re­treated with­out in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Louisville has emerged as a key flash­point in a sum­mer of un­rest be­cause of out­rage over the death of Ms Bre­onna Tay­lor, a 26-year-old black woman who was killed in March when the city’s po­lice burst into her apart­ment us­ing a so­called “no-knock” ar­rest war­rant that did not re­quire them to an­nounce them­selves.</p>
    <p>Ms Sadiqa Reynolds, pres­i­dent of the Louisville Ur­ban League, said that while the race was not can­celled as hoped, she be­lieves the pro­test­ers’ de­mands – which in­clude hold­ing of­fi­cers in­volved in Ms Tay­lor’s death ac­count­able – were heard.</p>
    <p>“To­day was a show of force from the com­mu­nity of Louisville to say that enough is enough,” she told Reuters. “We are tired of our lives not mat­ter­ing.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier on Sat­ur­day, a group of counter-pro­test­ers, bran­dish­ing pis­tols and long guns squared off against Black Lives Mat­ter pro­test­ers and got into shov­ing matches in a park down­town.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple on both sides screamed at each other, faces cen­time­tres apart. Af­ter about 45 min­utes, po­lice cleared the peo­ple from the park, but the protests out­side Churchill Downs con­tin­ued.</p>
    <p>The counter-pro­test­ers in­cluded about 250 pro-po­lice demon­stra­tors, in­clud­ing Mr Dy­lan Stevens, who goes by the nick­name “The An­gry Vik­ing” and claims to lead a group of what he calls “Pa­tri­ots”.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to his web­site, Mr Stevens sup­ports Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, the po­lice, the mil­i­tary and the right to bear arms.</p>
    <p>Mr Stevens, who was armed and dressed in tac­ti­cal gear, told pro­test­ers he was not there to op­pose them, ac­cord­ing to the Louisville Courier-Jour­nal.</p>
    <p>He said his group had come be­cause of a threat made by NFAC leader John­son in July to “burn the city to the ground” if jus­tice was not done in the Tay­lor case, the Courier-Jour­nal re­ported.</p>
    <p>Demon­stra­tions against racism and po­lice bru­tal­ity have swept the US since May 25, when Mr Ge­orge Floyd, a black man, died af­ter a Min­neapo­lis po­lice of­fi­cer knelt on his neck for nearly nine min­utes.</p>
    <p>Over in Rochester, New York, po­lice used ba­tons, pep­per balls and tear gas to push back about 2,000 pro­test­ers who marched to­wards the Pub­lic Safety Build­ing last Sat­ur­day night, chant­ing “Black Lives Mat­ter” and “Daniel Prude” – a ref­er­ence to a black man who died af­ter an encounter with the po­lice in March.</p>
    <p>The Rochester Po­lice Depart­ment said in a state­ment that pro­test­ers had ig­nored their or­ders to dis­perse, and that some hurled bot­tles, rocks and fire­works at of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>Demon­stra­tors started their march at the site of Mr Prude’s ar­rest. It was the fourth night of protests, which came af­ter Mr Prude’s fam­ily re­leased body cam­era footage show­ing of­fi­cers pinned Mr Prude to the pave­ment and re­strained him with a hood.</p>
    <p>In Port­land, po­lice de­scribed what they called “tu­mul­tuous and vi­o­lent con­duct” by pro­test­ers on the city’s Stark Street.</p>
    <p>“Fire bombs were thrown at of­fi­cers, in­jur­ing at least one com­mu­nity mem­ber,” po­lice said on Twit­ter, while re-tweet­ing a video posted by a New York Times re­porter show­ing fire bombs be­ing thrown and a pro­tester run­ning with his legs on fire.</p>
    <p>Port­land has seen nightly protests for over three months that have at times turned into vi­o­lent clashes be­tween demon­stra­tors and of­fi­cers, as well as be­tween right- and left-wing groups. Po­lice said they made ar­rests but did not give a num­ber.</p>
