    <p>• Af­ter months of vir­tu­ally en­cour­ag­ing his sup­port­ers to vote for Mr Joe Bi­den, Se­na­tor Bernie San­ders marked his re­turn to the cam­paign trail last Satur­day with a rally in New Hamp­shire for his one-time ri­val.</p>
    <p>Though many of his words were recog­nis­able to any­one who has long watched the Ver­mont se­na­tor speak, the cir­cum­stances were dra­mat­i­cally dif­fer­ent from any rally he has held be­fore – a point that was not lost on him.</p>
    <p>“I have par­tic­i­pated in many ral­lies in my life,” Mr San­ders said with a smile. “This is clearly the most un­usual.”</p>
    <p>But if the rally was atyp­i­cal for him, un­like his cus­tom­ar­ily large crowds that pack to­gether, those in at­ten­dance were in­structed from the out­set to main­tain so­cial dis­tanc­ing of at least 1.8m – it also felt fa­mil­iar.</p>
    <p>There was Mr San­ders, walk­ing up to his lectern to the song, Power To The Peo­ple. There he was, in his sig­na­ture sweater and jacket, wav­ing his right hand in the air.</p>
    <p>Much of his ad­dress, of course, was de­voted to Mr Bi­den. “It is no great se­cret that Joe Bi­den and I dis­agree on a num­ber of is­sues,” he said, as he of­ten does. But un­like dur­ing the pri­mary cam­paign, dur­ing which he and Mr Bi­den were ad­ver­saries, he went on to praise sev­eral of Mr Bi­den’s pro­pos­als, in­clud­ing on the econ­omy and health­care.</p>
    <p>“While Joe and I dis­agree on the best path to get to uni­ver­sal cov­er­age, his pro­posal will greatly ex­pand ac­cess to health­care and make it more af­ford­able for tens of mil­lions of peo­ple across this coun­try,” Mr San­ders said.</p>
    <p>And as he has many times since he dropped out of the pres­i­den­tial race in early April, Mr San­ders un­equiv­o­cally urged his sup­port­ers to vote for the for­mer vice-pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>“In the worst pub­lic health cri­sis of the last 100 years, we need Joe Bi­den as our pres­i­dent,” he said.</p>
    <p>One notable de­par­ture from his now-rou­tine Bi­den-back­ing speech was when Mr San­ders wished Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and First Lady Me­la­nia Trump, who were di­ag­nosed with the coro­n­avirus, “a full and speedy re­cov­ery”.</p>
    <p>He said: “What the last few days have told us is if there was ever any doubt, it should now be clear that no one – no one – is safe from this pan­demic.”</p>
