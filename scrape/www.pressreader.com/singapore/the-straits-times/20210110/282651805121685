    <p>• It has been more than 20 years since Ever­ton last won a ma­jor tro­phy in the 1995 FA Cup.</p>
    <p>Since then, the Tof­fees have gone through eight man­age­rial changes, and cur­rent boss Carlo Ancelotti in­sisted on Fri­day he knows the im­por­tance of the FA Cup in Eng­land.</p>
    <p>His side just about came through the third round of the com­pe­ti­tion with yes­ter­day’s 2-1 vic­tory in ex­tra time over Cham­pi­onship side Rother­ham at Good­i­son Park.</p>
    <p>“It was a tough match. We started the game well and Cenk (To­sun) scored a lovely goal. But they pushed us all the way,” said Ever­ton as­sis­tant man­ager Dun­can Fer­gu­son, who was on post-match me­dia du­ties.</p>
    <p>“It is a bit of a re­lief to get through, to be hon­est. The main thing is we are through to the next round, that’s the main pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>“The Cup is very im­por­tant to us. It’s a big com­pe­ti­tion and it’s a pri­or­ity for us. Hope­fully we can go as deep as we can.”</p>
    <p>Ancelotti rested key play­ers such as top scorer Do­minic Calvert-Lewin, for­ward Richarli­son and goal­keeper Jordan Pick­ford.</p>
    <p>To­sun, who started in place of Calvert-Lewin, opened the scor­ing in the ninth minute when he picked up a through pass from mid­fielder An­thony Gor­don be­fore chip­ping Rother­ham goal­keeper Ja­mal Black­man.</p>
    <p>The 29-year-old Turk­ish striker was mak­ing his first start for Ever­ton since Novem­ber 2019 and his re­turn to scor­ing form will be a boost to his hopes of mak­ing his coun­try’s squad for the Euro­pean Cham­pi­onship this sum­mer.</p>
    <p>Rother­ham hit back in the 56th minute when right-back Matthew Olo­sunde pounced on a loose ball in­side the box and beat Ever­ton goal­keeper Robin Olsen with a shot to the bot­tom-left cor­ner.</p>
    <p>To­sun looked to have sneaked in a late win­ner in the 87th minute but a VAR (video as­sis­tant ref­eree) re­view deemed that the striker was off­side and the match went into ex­tra time, with no re­plays in this sea­son’s FA Cup.</p>
    <p>The Premier League side’s qual­ity even­tu­ally showed through French­man Ab­doulaye Doucoure as he burst through mid­field and fired an un­stop­pable shot into the bot­tom-left cor­ner in the 93rd minute to seal the win.</p>
    <p>“I thought we were or­gan­ised re­ally well and in and out of pos­ses­sion. We caused them prob­lems, so I could not be prouder,” said Rother­ham man­ager Paul Warne, whose side are sec­ond-last in the sec­ond-tier Cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>With Ever­ton through to the fourth round, Ancelotti can still har­bour hopes of win­ning the club’s sixth FA Cup.</p>
