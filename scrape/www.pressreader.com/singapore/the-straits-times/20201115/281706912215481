    <p>Mr Amar Tukaram Shinde, 24, felt like a bird let out of a cage as he set foot on land after be­ing at sea for 19 months.</p>
    <p>He boarded a cargo ship in Sin­ga­pore in April last year to ful­fil an 11-month con­tract, but after it ex­pired, he could not leave due to the coro­n­avirus pandemic.</p>
    <p>Along with his four In­dian and 16 Viet­namese crew mates, he signed off in Ho Chi Minh City yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Shinde said: “I am so happy. I feel a dif­fer­ent en­ergy cours­ing through me after touch­ing land. I feel like a bird that has been let out of its cage and is soar­ing through the air, en­joy­ing its free­dom.”</p>
    <p>Over the last few months, he had veered be­tween hope and de­spair, un­able to sign off at any port for var­i­ous Covid-19-re­lated rea­sons.</p>
    <p>The crew was turned away from China in May and Au­gust be­cause of bor­der re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>In the Philip­pines, the crew could not get per­mis­sion to sign off as there was no re­place­ment crew to take over.</p>
    <p>To put pres­sure on the com­pany that hired them, he and his four In­dian crew mates had been on strike since Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Once Mr Shinde is on shore, he is re­quired to quar­an­tine for 14 days be­fore he can re­turn home to his anx­ious par­ents in the city of Pune, in the west­ern In­dian state of Ma­ha­rash­tra.</p>
    <p>“The body is weak. I am men­tally ex­hausted,” he said, adding that he is long­ing for In­dian food after months of Viet­namese fare.</p>
    <p>Crew sign-off and sign-on have al­ways been a com­plex lo­gis­ti­cal is­sue, with many mov­ing parts.</p>
    <p>Sea­far­ers re­quire pa­per­work to cross mul­ti­ple bor­ders and work ac­cord­ing to con­tracts that usu­ally do not stretch be­yond 11 months.</p>
    <p>But the pandemic has up­ended the en­tire process.</p>
    <p>An in­com­ing crew mem­ber who tests pos­i­tive for Covid-19 means the out­go­ing crew mem­ber can­not be re­lieved, as roles on ships are mostly non-trans­fer­able.</p>
    <p>Shipown­ers noted that dif­fer­ent re­stric­tions in dif­fer­ent coun­tries – some go­ing in and out of lock­downs – added to the chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>Since the pandemic, the 24-hour Bri­tish-based helpline of the In­ter­na­tional Sea­far­ers’ Wel­fare and As­sis­tance Net­work (Iswan) has re­ceived, on av­er­age, 600 to 700 cases each month in­volv­ing dis­tressed sailors around the world. At its peak, cases reached 800.</p>
    <p>Mr Chi­rag Bahri, di­rec­tor of re­gions (In­dia) at Iswan, said the situa</p>
    <p>FAM­ILY’S TEARS</p>
    <p>All this time, I have never cried in front of Ken­zie. I quickly rushed into the kitchen. I don’t want to cry in front of my son.’’</p>
    <p>MS INGRID FREDERICA, whose hus­band Sam­farid Fauzi has not been home for 21/2 years. Their son, Rhafa</p>
    <p>Ken­zie Arz­iqi, burst into tears be­fore he blew out his birth­day can­dles in May, say­ing he wanted his dad.</p>
    <p>tion has eased since May and June, but it has not been fully re­solved.</p>
    <p>“There are good com­pa­nies which are do­ing char­tered flights and mak­ing use of ev­ery pos­si­ble re­source to get crew ex­changed,” he said, adding that the chal­lenge is the com­pa­nies that do not want to spend the ex­tra money, which has left the crews of many ships stranded on their ves­sels.</p>
    <p>Cap­tain Shiv Halbe, chief ex­ec­u­tive of The Mar­itime As­so­ci­a­tion of Shipown­ers, Ship­man­agers and Agents (Massa), said the cost of fly­ing a crew out has gone up by 10 to 12 times, since most in­ter­na­tional flights are grounded.</p>
    <p>“Com­mer­cially, we are ex­pected to op­er­ate at the same level,” said Capt Halbe, not­ing that this is un­re­al­is­tic with over­worked crews.</p>
    <p>“When duty over­runs take place, there is bound to be an ad­verse im­pact on sea­far­ers’ per­for­mance, and then they will make silly mis­takes. The world has to be kinder to sea­far­ers.”</p>
    <p>So far this year, In­dia has repa­tri­ated 199,000 sea­far­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Amitabh Ku­mar, In­dia’s Direc­torate-Gen­eral of Ship­ping, said: “Given the trend, we will see more repa­tri­a­tion (of In­dian sea­far­ers) this year, com­pared with the 234,000 last year.”</p>
    <p>But there are thou­sands of other sea­far­ers still un­able to get home.</p>
    <p>Many are at the mercy of un­scrupu­lous shipown­ers, who have used the pandemic as an ex­cuse to ex­ploit sailors.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian Sam­farid Fauzi has not been home for 21/ years.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>His anx­ious wife does not even know the where­abouts of her hus­band, who is work­ing on a Chi­ne­se­owned fish­ing ves­sel.</p>
    <p>The shipowner, via an agency in In­done­sia, blamed the coro­n­avirus for the de­layed repa­tri­a­tion, and broke sev­eral prom­ises that her hus­band would re­turn home, Ms Ingrid Frederica, 31, told The Sun­day Times on Thurs­day at her rented home in Te­gal, a city in Cen­tral Java prov­ince.</p>
    <p>Mr Sam­farid signed a two-year con­tract be­gin­ning in April 2018 to work for In­done­sian fish­ing boat agency Pun­cak Jaya Sa­mu­dra, which is owned by a Chi­nese com­pany.</p>
    <p>Though sailors should not work more than 11 months in a row, many In­done­sian sea­far­ers on fish­ing boats are given the op­tion of only a two-year con­tract.</p>
    <p>Mr Sam­farid worked on two sep­a­rate fish­ing boats in his first two trips. But in Au­gust last year, he asked to cut short his con­tract, say­ing he faced bru­tal work­ing hours and was given ined­i­ble food. The cap­tain de­nied his re­quest and he was not al­lowed to leave the boat.</p>
    <p>Mr Sam­farid waited un­til his con­tract ex­pired in April, where­upon he was told that a crew change was not pos­si­ble be­cause of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old for­mer fac­tory labourer was then promised he could go home in June, but was in­stead trans­ferred to an­other com­pany ves­sel. Most re­cently, his fam­ily ex­pected him back last Tues­day, but that day came and went.</p>
    <p>In all this time, Ms Ingrid has heard her hus­band’s voice only twice – in Oc­to­ber 2018 and in July last year. She showed The Sun­day Times a mo­bile text mes­sage he had sent ear­lier this year that de­scribed the work­ing con­di­tions on board.</p>
    <p>The mes­sage said: “We feel like we are be­ing tor­tured. Be­tween Septem­ber and November, they gave us fried rot­ten chicken… some­times we just had rice and salt… other times rice with rot­ten cu­cum­ber.”</p>
    <p>In May, she pan­icked when In­done­sian me­dia re­ported that a video had shown the bod­ies of three In­done­sian sea­men be­ing thrown into the sea off a Chi­nese boat.</p>
    <p>Mr Toni Pan­garibuan, from the In­done­sian Sea­far­ers’ Union, told The Sun­day Times that the coun­try needs a mora­to­rium on sea­men work­ing on for­eign fish­ing ves­sels un­less there is a guar­an­tee of pro­tec­tions and a one-year max­i­mum work con­tract. He said: “A lot of shipown­ers from China, Tai­wan re­quire sea­far­ers work­ing for them to have a two-year con­tract, leav­ing no other op­tion.”</p>
    <p>Mr Toni noted that shipown­ers con­tin­ued to use the pandemic as an ex­cuse to avoid a crew change, stress­ing that such a change is ev­ery sea­farer’s right and any rel­e­vant costs must be borne by the em­ployer.</p>
    <p>“There are flights for char­ter. Fares are more ex­pen­sive. But this is a risk that must be cov­ered by any shipown­ers. If you run a com­pany, you should not ex­pect you will only op­er­ate on profit.”</p>
    <p>Be­fore Mr Sam­farid left, he promised his son, Rhafa Ken­zie Arz­iqi, that he would take him to school on the very first day.</p>
    <p>Ken­zie is now six and a kinder­gartener, and knows only that the pandemic is pre­vent­ing his fa­ther from com­ing home.</p>
    <p>In May, he cel­e­brated his birth­day, which is two days shy of his fa­ther’s. The boy burst into tears just be­fore he blew out his birth­day can­dles, say­ing he wanted his dad.</p>
    <p>“All this time, I have never cried in front of Ken­zie,” Ms Ingrid said.</p>
    <p>“I quickly rushed into the kitchen. I don’t want to cry in front of my son.”</p>
