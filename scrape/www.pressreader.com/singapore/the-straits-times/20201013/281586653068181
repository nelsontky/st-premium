    <p>Com­pa­nies look­ing to in­crease pro­duc­tiv­ity, ex­pand over­seas, or sim­ply pivot and grow will soon be able to tap big­ger grants and ex­panded loan schemes. These schemes are no longer about tid­ing busi­nesses over the cur­rent cri­sis, but about help­ing them to adapt to the new re­al­ity, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies look­ing to in­crease pro­duc­tiv­ity, ex­pand over­seas, or sim­ply pivot and grow, will soon be able to tap big­ger grants and ex­panded loan schemes.</p>
    <p>These sup­port schemes are no longer about tid­ing busi­nesses over the cur­rent cri­sis, but about help­ing them to adapt to the new re­al­ity, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said as he an­nounced sev­eral en­hance­ments yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Firms look­ing to in­ter­na­tion­alise will be able to have up to 80 per cent of qual­i­fy­ing costs cov­ered from Nov 1 to Sept 30 next year – up from 70 per cent cur­rently – un­der the Mar­ket Readi­ness As­sis­tance Grant.</p>
    <p>The scope of the grant’s cov­er­age will also be ex­tended to cover par­tic­i­pa­tion in vir­tual trade fairs, to en­cour­age com­pa­nies to find new over­seas op­por­tu­ni­ties through such plat­forms, Mr Chan said dur­ing a vir­tual me­dia brief­ing.</p>
    <p>Re­tail­ers, in par­tic­u­lar, would be wise to ex­pand their reach over­seas, as the Covid-19 pan­demic has ac­cel­er­ated the growth of on­line shop­ping and opened up new op­por­tu­ni­ties, he said.</p>
    <p>The higher level of sup­port cur­rently avail­able to busi­nesses look­ing to pivot, grow and dig­i­talise will be avail­able for an ad­di­tional nine months.</p>
    <p>The En­ter­prise De­vel­op­ment and Pro­duc­tiv­ity Solutions grants will now cover up to 80 per cent of qual­i­fy­ing costs un­til Sept 30 next year.</p>
    <p>More help will also be avail­able to busi­nesses seek­ing loans.</p>
    <p>From Jan 1 next year, con­struc­tion com­pa­nies can ap­ply for loans to fi­nance the ful­fil­ment of se­cured do­mes­tic projects with at least half of the risk shared by the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The Tem­po­rary Bridg­ing Loan Pro­gramme, which pro­vides ac­cess to work­ing cap­i­tal, and a fi­nanc­ing scheme for trade loans will also be ex­tended by six months.</p>
    <p>Both schemes will see the Gov­ern­ment’s risk share low­ered from 90 per cent to 70 per cent from April 1 next year, how­ever.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing af­ter a visit to SK Jew­ellery’s head­quar­ters in Changi Busi­ness Park, Mr Chan said the re­tail sec­tor faces a bumpy road to re­cov­ery, as the chal­lenges it faces are twofold.</p>
    <p>Struc­tural pres­sures such as the rise of e-com­merce had al­ready put it un­der strain be­fore the pan­demic hit, the min­is­ter noted, while a lower propen­sity to spend will per­sist in the near term.</p>
    <p>There are se­ri­ous im­pli­ca­tions to this, as the re­tail sec­tor em­ploys about 4.1 per cent of the Repub­lic’s to­tal work­force, Mr Chan said.</p>
    <p>“Any im­pact on the re­tail in­dus­try will have very grave con­se­quences on the em­ploy­ment prospects of the work­ers in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said at the same event that there are 2,500 jobs avail­able in the re­tail in­dus­try, of which two in five are for pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians.</p>
    <p>Work­ers in the sec­tor are also be­ing trained to meet the chal­lenges of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and re­de­ployed to higher value-add job roles, she said.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan warned that busi­nesses that do not move away from the traditiona­l re­tail model will find it dif­fi­cult to sur­vive.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore com­pa­nies will have to dis­tin­guish them­selves in an in­ter­na­tional mar­ket­place, he said, cit­ing SK Jew­ellery as an ex­am­ple of a re­tailer that has de­vel­oped a niche by cre­at­ing lab-grown di­a­monds.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim Yong Sheng, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor and group chief ex­ec­u­tive of SK Jew­ellery, said these di­a­monds tap into the trend of younger con­sumers seek­ing more en­vi­ron­men­tally friendly pur­chases.</p>
    <p>The firm has also de­vel­oped vir­tual con­sul­ta­tions for cus­tomers shop­ping for en­gage­ment rings, tap­ping schemes such as the En­ter­prise De­vel­op­ment Grant to en­hance its e-com­merce and last-mile de­liv­ery ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mr Ho Meng Kit, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion, said the ex­ten­sion of gov­ern­ment as­sis­tance schemes will pro­vide more time for busi­ness con­di­tions to sta­bilise.</p>
    <p>Urg­ing firms to make full use of the schemes to re­tool, he said: “This will help busi­nesses forge a new path for­ward and thrive in the long run.”</p>
