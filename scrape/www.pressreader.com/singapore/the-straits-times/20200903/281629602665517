    <p>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that Sin­ga­pore can­not let its guard down in fight­ing Covid-19, even if the sit­u­a­tion is get­ting bet­ter here.</p>
    <p>He cited a re­cent sur­vey by The Straits Times pub­lished on Aug 16 that showed al­most half of the re­spon­dents were weary of pan­demic safety mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Join­ing the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress i n Par­lia­ment, PM Lee said: “The irony (is) the more suc­cess­ful we are in keep­ing cases low, the more peo­ple won­der whether all these painful mea­sures are necessary.”</p>
    <p>The on­line sur­vey of 1,000 peo­ple, rep­re­sen­ta­tive of the Sin­ga­pore res­i­dent pop­u­la­tion aged 16 and above, showed that 44 per cent were tired of fol­low­ing the necessary health mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Of those sur­veyed, 27 per cent said that hav­ing to wear a mask was the most frus­trat­ing virus coun­ter­mea­sure.</p>
    <p>Other re­sults of the sur­vey in­clude how one in five saw check­ing in with SafeEn­try as a nui­sance, while 14 per cent were un­happy about hav­ing to limit the size of phys­i­cal gather­ings with friends and fam­ily.</p>
    <p>De­spite the fa­tigue, most re­spon­dents said they largely un­der­stood the ra­tio­nale be­hind the rules and fol­lowed them.</p>
    <p>More than three quar­ters felt the mea­sures were ei­ther pro­por­tion­ate to the scale of the out­break, or “a bit strict, but rea­son­able”.</p>
    <p>The sta­ble Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion here must not lull Sin­ga­pore­ans into let­ting their guard down, said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>He re­counted to the House a re­cent e-mail he re­ceived from a univer­sity stu­dent, whose so­cialis</p>
    <p>ing had been dis­rupted.</p>
    <p>The stu­dent com­plained that Sin­ga­pore’s re­sponse to Covid-19 was “one of the great­est over­re­ac­tions to a pub­lic health is­sue”.</p>
    <p>As proof, the stu­dent noted that hospi­tals here were far from be­ing over­whelmed. In­stead, he ad­vo­cated the coun­try let young Sin­ga­pore­ans “do us the ser­vice of achiev­ing herd im­mu­nity”.</p>
    <p>“You only have to look at the sit­u­a­tion in other cities that have let this hap­pen to imag­ine how this could have turned out for us,” PM Lee said.</p>
    <p>The Prime Minister cau­tioned that the coro­n­avirus re­mains as in­fec­tious and po­tent as it was be­fore, and that this has not changed.</p>
    <p>What has changed, how­ever, are the mea­sures that Sin­ga­pore has taken to turn the tide against the</p>
    <p>dis­ease, and how the coun­try has built up its ca­pa­bil­i­ties to con­tain it.</p>
    <p>“If we re­lax these mea­sures now be­cause the num­bers have come down, we will have a resur­gence,” he said, point­ing to how this has hap­pened in some cities in Europe as well as in many other places in the world.</p>
