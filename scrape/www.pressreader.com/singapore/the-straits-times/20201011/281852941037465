    <p>1</p>
    <p>What does the law con­tain?</p>
    <p>The “om­nibus law” re­vises 79 ex­ist­ing laws and cov­ers a wide range of is­sues in 11 clus­ters, in­clud­ing re­duc­ing bu­reau­cracy, stream­lin­ing pro­ce­dures for get­ting in­vest­ment per­mits, labour ar­range­ment and land ac­qui­si­tion, and in­creas­ing the ease of do­ing busi­ness, that are all in­tended to fa­cil­i­tate in­vest­ment and j ob cre­ation.</p>
    <p>Ba­si­cally, it does away with over­lap­ping rules and com­pli­cated pro­ce­dures so that it is eas­ier for in­vestors to do busi­ness. The re­forms pro­moted by the law also bring flex­i­bil­ity to In­done­sia’s labour market.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>What is con­tro­ver­sial about the law?</p>
    <p>The law cuts sev­er­ance pay to a max­i­mum of 19 months’ salary, from 32 months pre­vi­ously. The govern­ment pays an ad­di­tional six months of wages.</p>
    <p>It re­moves a two-year cap on con­tract em­ploy­ment, al­low­ing firms to keep work­ers on con­tract in­def­i­nitely.</p>
    <p>It also re­laxes re­stric­tions on out­sourc­ing and eases re­quire­ments on the hir­ing of for­eign work­ers.</p>
    <p>The law opens the pos­si­bil­ity of firms re­quir­ing labour­ers to work six days a week, seven hours a day.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>What are the main crit­i­cisms?</p>
    <p>Labour unions say the law slashes work­ers’ rights to a de­cent wage and threat­ens their job se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Civil so­ci­ety groups crit­i­cise the lack of trans­parency and pub­lic en­gage­ment in de­lib­er­at­ing the Bill and the haste with which Par­lia­ment passed it into law.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers slam the bad tim­ing, as the coun­try strug­gles eco­nom­i­cally due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>What does the busi­ness com­mu­nity say?</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses cheer the pas­sage of the over­due law.</p>
    <p>They also say the law is fair towards work­ers as new rules re­quire com­pa­nies to com­pen­sate con­tract work­ers in the event of job terminatio­n.</p>
    <p>Lower sev­er­ance pay and sim­pler pro­ce­dures to ob­tain busi­ness per­mits will raise In­done­sia’s com­pet­i­tive­ness glob­ally and lure more in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>What is in it for Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo?</p>
    <p>In­done­sia has long tried to re­vise its un­friendly labour law to pre­vent for­eign in­vestors from flee­ing to ri­val coun­tries such as Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ous pres­i­dents had tried – and failed – to push through sim­i­lar laws, as they were fiercely op­posed by labour unions. Covid-19 has in­jected fresh im­pe­tus into push­ing through the re­forms, which are ex­pected to cre­ate mil­lions of jobs.</p>
    <p>6</p>
    <p>Was the back­lash not an­tic­i­pated? Why was there no pub­lic con­sul­ta­tion?</p>
    <p>The govern­ment said it had in­vited labour unions to dis­cuss the Bill, but not all turned up as views were split among them.</p>
    <p>It also main­tained that the protests are be­ing fu­elled by dis­in­for­ma­tion and fake news on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Some of­fi­cials have also alleged that in­flu­en­tial fig­ures are fund­ing the protests for self-serv­ing pur­poses.</p>
