    <p>China warned yes­ter­day that the United States is de­stroy­ing peace and sta­bil­ity, and stir­ring trou­ble in the South China Sea, af­ter the US’ guided mis­sile de­stroyer USS Mustin car­ried out a free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion op­er­a­tion near the Para­cel Is­lands, where the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army has been car­ry­ing out an ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>Washington is de­stroy­ing peace and sta­bil­ity, and stir­ring trou­ble in the South China Sea, Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>His com­ments came af­ter the US’ guided mis­sile de­stroyer USS Mustin car­ried out a free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion op­er­a­tion near the Para­cel Is­lands, where the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army (PLA) is car­ry­ing out an ex­er­cise from Sun­day to today.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese me­dia noted this was the sec­ond time in a week that Washington had car­ried out such “risky” op­er­a­tions in ar­eas where the PLA is hold­ing ex­er­cises. The na­tion­al­ist Global</p>
    <p>Times ran a re­port that Bei­jing’s naval and air forces had tracked, iden­ti­fied and ex­pelled the USS Mustin.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers say Bei­jing has been un­usu­ally vo­cal about what it sees as in­cur­sions by the US, point­ing out that this was likely a move to paint Washington as provo­ca­teur.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, the United States sent a U2 spy plane into an area des­ig­nated by Bei­jing as a no-fly zone, where the PLA’s North­ern Theatre Com­mand was car­ry­ing out live­fire ex­er­cises, and drew an­gry protests from Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>China launched anti-ship bal­lis­tic mis­siles af­ter the U2 spy plane’s in­cur­sion, drop­ping them near the Paracels.</p>
    <p>The US De­fence Depart­ment on Thurs­day said the mis­sile tests threat­ened peace and sta­bil­ity in the re­gion and “call into ques­tion (China’s) mo­ti­va­tions with on­go­ing ne­go­ti­a­tions for a Code of Con­duct be­tween China and Asean”, re­fer­ring to talks to set­tle on a set of rules and norms to pre­vent con­flict.</p>
    <p>“This mil­i­tary ex­er­cise is the lat­est in a long string of PRC ac­tions to as­sert un­law­ful mar­itime claims and dis­ad­van­tage its South-east</p>
    <p>Asian neigh­bours i n the South China Sea,” the De­fence Depart­ment said in a state­ment, re­fer­ring to the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has over­lap­ping claims with Viet­nam, the Philip­pines, Malaysia, In­done­sia and Tai­wan in the South China Sea, where it has been build­ing mil­i­tary in­stal­la­tions on dis­puted reefs and out­crop­pings to as­sert its sovereignt­y.</p>
    <p>The USS Mustin’s sail­ing is the lat­est tit for tat in­volv­ing the mil­i­taries of both su­per­pow­ers, which in the past months have seen re­la­tions sour over is­sues in­clud­ing trade, tech­nol­ogy and es­pi­onage.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhao said yes­ter­day that China’s drills in the South China Sea were not tar­geted at any coun­try and were un­re­lated to the ter­ri­to­rial dis­putes in those wa­ters.</p>
    <p>Tak­ing aim at the US, he said: “The United States is the de­stroyer of peace and sta­bil­ity, and a trou­ble­maker in the South China Sea, this is ob­vi­ous to the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity. The United States should stop mak­ing trou­ble and sow­ing dis­cord, and play a con­struc­tive role in main­tain­ing re­gional peace and sta­bil­ity in the South China Sea.”</p>
    <p>Bei­jing’s vo­cal stance is a strat­egy to paint Washington as the ag­gres­sor, said ob­servers.</p>
    <p>Re­gard­ing the US re­con­nais­sance plane, Shang­hai-based mil­i­tary com­men­ta­tor Ni Lex­iong said China chose to “pub­licly ad­mon­ish the US for it even though it would mean a loss of face”.</p>
    <p>“It was an ob­vi­ous provo­ca­tion and wanted to cause trou­ble... In the past there were in­ci­dents like th­ese but China would usu­ally keep quiet about it,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Collin Koh, a re­search fel­low at the In­sti­tute of De­fence and Strate­gic Stud­ies in Sin­ga­pore, called this a “con­tes­ta­tion of nar­ra­tives” be­tween Bei­jing and Washington.</p>
    <p>So while ten­sions are ris­ing in the South China Sea, ac­tual con­flict is un­likely as the party that fires the first shot would lose the moral high ground, he said. “China cer­tainly wants to gain the up­per hand when it comes to the moral high ground, it wants to be painted as the vic­tim and paint the US as the ag­gres­sor.”</p>
    <p>CHINA WANTS MORAL HIGH GROUND</p>
