    <p>A we­fie of DBS Bank chief ex­ec­u­tive Piyush Gupta with a room full of the bank’s In­dian em­ploy­ees was cir­cu­lated on­line re­cently to play up the is­sue of the con­cen­tra­tion of for­eign pro­fes­sion­als in banks, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
    <p>It was first posted on a Face­book page last Sep­tem­ber, and had been cap­tioned “Eye sight test: Find a Sin­ga­porean or Chi­nese in this DBS photo”, sug­gest­ing that the bank was favour­ing for­eign­ers over Sin­ga­pore­ans here, added PM Lee.</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing it as “fake news”, he said the pic­ture had in fact been taken in In­dia where the bank had opened a new of­fice. It was taken in Mum­bai in Sep­tem­ber 2017.</p>
    <p>“The pic­ture resur­faced re­cently and went vi­ral, which just shows that dur­ing tough times, this sub­ject is more neu­ral­gic,” said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>“Last Sep­tem­ber was a dif­fer­ent world. Many peo­ple took of­fence, got worked up, and be­rated DBS, flamed them.”</p>
    <p>He said: “The per­son who put up the post surely knew this, yet he ir­re­spon­si­bly mis­used the we­fie to in­sin­u­ate that DBS in Sin­ga­pore was not be­ing fair to Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
    <p>Even then, added PM Lee, the dam­age was done. He noted that with the Covid-19 pan­demic tak­ing a toll on the econ­omy, and pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians fac­ing more un­cer­tainty in their jobs, the is­sue of the num­ber of for­eign pro­fes­sion­als in par­tic­u­lar in­dus­tries can be eas­ily played up.</p>
    <p>“We know there are some peo­ple who are stir­ring this up,” he said.</p>
