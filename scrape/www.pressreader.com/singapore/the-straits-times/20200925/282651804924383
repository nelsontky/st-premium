    <p>Peo­ple here talk very ca­su­ally about hawk­ers. When we do that, we’re re­fer­ring to peo­ple who op­er­ate in hawker or food cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Ah Pui – real name Ang Boon Ee – was a hawker in the true sense of the word. The 64-year-old used to ply the streets of Tiong Bahru with his push­cart, sell­ing pork satay. He kept get­ting busted, of course. This is Sin­ga­pore af­ter all.</p>
    <p>My friends and I would have him grill satay at house par­ties and it was al­ways the high­light of our meals. His satay – he does only pork – is non­pareil.</p>
    <p>Since Au­gust last year, he has joined a group of en­trepreneur­s who run a cafe in Pearl’s Hill Ter­race, a laid-back en­clave perched on top of a hill. It used to house the op­er­a­tional head­quar­ters of the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force.</p>
    <p>One of the peo­ple be­hind the cafe, Mr Ben­jamin Tan, 38, used to live in Tiong Bahru and was a reg­u­lar cus­tomer. They be­came friends and Mr Tan per­suaded Mr Ang to join him and his part­ners. So now, there is no need for hawk­ing on the streets. Mr Ang has a le­git gig.</p>
    <p>Is his pork satay still as good?</p>
    <p>It is still the best I have ever had.</p>
    <p>But it is dif­fer­ent from what it used to be.</p>
    <p>The spe­cial thing about his pork satay ($9 for 10 sticks) is the strip of fat in be­tween the pieces of meat. He grills it so ex­pertly that the fat has a QQ tex­ture.</p>
    <p>The pork pieces used to be smaller, so the fat stood out more. Now, there’s a bit more pork. It’s a chunkier bite, to be sure, and most peo­ple will not com­plain.</p>
    <p>I won’t ei­ther. Not when I dunk the satay into the thick peanut sauce with a big dol­lop of fresh pineap­ple puree in the mid­dle. Then crunch,</p>
    <p>QQ, tart­ness and spice meld and make magic.</p>
    <p>If you are very lucky, you might see Mr Ang tend­ing to the grill him­self. Oth­er­wise, he is in the kitchen, prep­ping satay, cut­ting pieces of pork off a huge chunk.</p>
    <p>I go to the cafe just for the pork satay, but am per­suaded to try the Pin­cho Sate Chicken ($9 for 10 sticks), with a very perky chimichurr­i driz­zle.</p>
    <p>There are pasta dishes on the menu too, done by Mr Sebastian Liu, 37, who used to work for the Les</p>
    <p>Amis Group. Mr Tan of­fers an ar­ray of Nanyang-style coffee drinks.</p>
    <p>Many peo­ple talk about pre­serv­ing hawker cul­ture and lament when stel­lar hawk­ers re­tire. In­stead of just talk­ing and lament­ing, the peo­ple who run the cafe – Mr Tan, Mr Liu, Mr Mau­rice Goh and Mr Melvin Tay – did some­thing about it. They per­suaded Mr Ang to join them and, in the process, are in­tro­duc­ing his pork satay to a new au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>Plus, fans like me can have this phe­nom­e­nal pork satay al­most any­time we want.</p>
    <p>Thank you.</p>
