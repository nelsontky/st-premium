    <p>Three new coro­n­avirus clus­ters in worker dor­mi­to­ries were an­nounced by the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The first, Changi Lodge II at 80 Tanah Merah Coast Road, was linked to six cases, while North Coast Lodge in Ad­mi­ralty was linked to seven cases. Two new pa­tients from Toh Guan Dor­mi­tory at 19A Toh Guan Road East were linked to five pre­vi­ous cases.</p>
    <p>Mul­ti­ple lo­ca­tions in Or­chard Road were added to the list of places in­fec­tious pa­tients vis­ited. They in­clude Ap­ple Or­chard Road, Cineleisur­e Or­chard and Lucky Plaza. Also on the list were Uni­ver­sal Stu­dios Sin­ga­pore, Sky­line Luge Sen­tosa and shops in VivoCity.</p>
    <p>MOH pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions that in­fec­tious pa­tients vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes and the times they vis­ited to get peo­ple who were at those places at the same time to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit. The full list of lo­ca­tions and times is on MOH’s web­site. It has said close con­tacts would have been no­ti­fied and there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned if necessary.</p>
    <p>Three com­mu­nity cases were re­ported yes­ter­day: a Sin­ga­porean, a work pass holder and a work per­mit holder. All three were un­linked as of yes­ter­day, and MOH said close con­tacts have been iso­lated and placed on quar­an­tine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quar­an­tine pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>Three im­ported cases were also re­ported yes­ter­day. Of these, two are a work pass holder and a work per­mit holder who ar­rived here sep­a­rately from In­dia and the Philip­pines on Aug 21. Both were placed on 14-day stay-home no­tices and were tested while serv­ing their no­tices at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing im­ported case is a sea­man who was tested upon ar­rival from In­done­sia on Aug 26. He was iso­lated while await­ing his test re­sult, which came back pos­i­tive on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing i n dorms made up the re­main­ing 43 of 49 new cases an­nounced yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 56,860.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has in­creased from two cases two weeks ago to three in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of one case per day over the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>With 142 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 55,876 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 75 pa­tients re­mained in hospi­tal yes­ter­day, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 867 were re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
