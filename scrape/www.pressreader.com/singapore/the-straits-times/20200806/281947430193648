    <p>With pre­lim­i­nary data show­ing that the un­em­ploy­ment rate rose to 2.9 per cent in June – the high­est in over a decade – the Na­tional Wages Coun­cil (NWC) will re­con­vene this year to up­date its rec­om­men­da­tions on wages. This is only the fourth time that the coun­cil is relook­ing its guide­lines in the same year. Many em­ploy­ers fol­lowed its ear­lier rec­om­men­da­tions to re­duce other costs and tap gov­ern­ment sup­port be­fore slash­ing wages. But there re­main sig­nif­i­cant eco­nomic head­winds and un­cer­tain­ties. Labour chief Ng Chee Meng has warned that while gov­ern­ment re­lief has shielded ev­ery­one from the worst eco­nomic ef­fects of the Covid-19 pan­demic, there will be more cut­backs and re­trench­ments ahead.</p>
    <p>Much of the un­cer­tainty sur­rounds how long the pan­demic will last. Coun­tries which ear­lier earned world­wide ad­mi­ra­tion for their han­dling of Covid-19 are see­ing a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions. Aus­tralia and Ja­pan are now record­ing more daily cases than at the peak of the first wave in March and April. An im­ported, and more in­fec­tious, strain has spread in Hong Kong. Un­til an ef­fec­tive vac­cine is found, or the virus burns it­self out, it will find a way to sneak past bor­ders and spread among com­mu­ni­ties. As coun­tries cy­cle through re­peated lock­downs and safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, busi­nesses will con­tinue to ex­pe­ri­ence un­der-ca­pac­ity and weak de­mand, and face pres­sure to re­trench work­ers.</p>
    <p>Mea­sures sim­i­lar to those taken dur­ing past crises can help deal with the weak labour mar­ket. On top of a cut to em­ploy­ers’ Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund con­tri­bu­tions, the NWC may well sug­gest a wage cut of sev­eral per­cent­age points, just as it had done in the 1998 Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis. The Jobs Sup­port Scheme of wage sub­si­dies could be ex­tended for the worst-hit in­dus­tries. Em­ploy­ers could also sec­ond work­ers to sec­tors that are still hir­ing, so as to pre­serve their own man­power ca­pa­bil­i­ties while keep­ing work­ers em­ployed. Oth­ers have called for a dedicated tri­par­tite of­fice to look af­ter gig work­ers, as well as pay hikes for lowwage work­ers in es­sen­tial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>But the fis­cal im­pact of such mea­sures will need to be weighed care­fully. Gov­ern­ments typ­i­cally aim for a bal­ance over the busi­ness cy­cle, re­pay­ing in up­turns what they borrow in down­turns. In the past, such debt was eas­ier to re­pay due to strong growth that pared down debt even as in­comes ex­panded. Yet to­day, de­spite low in­ter­est rates, an age­ing pop­u­la­tion and low pro­duc­tiv­ity growth mean that the debt passed on is likely to weigh down fu­ture gen­er­a­tions. While gov­ern­ments must pro­tect work­ers by re­train­ing them and pro­vid­ing so­cial safety nets, they can­not pro­tect ev­ery job. They will have to be dis­crim­i­nat­ing in the firms they sup­port, rather than pay them to re­tain work­ers in­def­i­nitely when some of their work has clearly dis­ap­peared.</p>
