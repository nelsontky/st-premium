    <p>This year, on­line Robin­hood and its mil­lions of younger-than-av­er­age cus­tomers have found them­selves at the cen­tre of at­ten­tion that is comic and tragic.</p>
    <p>“Robin­hood: ‘ We now al­low teenagers with their par­ents’ credit cards to trade stocks’” went the April head­line on satire site Stonk Mar­ket. Two months later, the head­lines were far more sober­ing, af­ter a 20-year-old killed himself, leav­ing be­hind a note about his neg­a­tive Robin­hood bal­ance.</p>
    <p>Robin­hood’s cus­tomers trade fast – of­ten in par­tic­u­larly volatile types of in­vest­ments – and can lose lots quickly. Cus­tomers have gone to its head­quar­ters in Menlo Park, Cal­i­for­nia, to com­plain, and the com­pany has in­stalled bul­let­proof glass.</p>
    <p>All of this ac­tiv­ity fright­ens many par­ents and with good rea­son. But own­ing just a few shares of a com­pany’s stock is some­thing else en­tirely, and it need not lead to ruin or in­grain bad in­vest­ing habits. It can be the way to build good ones.</p>
    <p>Learn­ing about fi­nan­cial risks can be chal­leng­ing for chil­dren whose fam­i­lies have never faced much eco­nomic hard­ship. Nev­er­the­less, it’s a cru­cial les­son.</p>
    <p>The best way for most peo­ple to save enough for re­tire­ment is to start early, in­vest most of the money in stocks early on and hang on tight for half a cen­tury.</p>
    <p>Watch­ing with dread or ex­hil­a­ra­tion as bal­ances fall when the mar­ket swoons or rise when it booms can lead to poor de­ci­sions. The ear­lier some­one experience­s that volatil­ity and learns how to re­act to it, the bet­ter.</p>
    <p>Why stocks for teenagers then? They of­fer reg­u­lar score-keep­ing and the pos­si­bil­ity of a bit of real pain when the stakes are lower than they are when man­ag­ing larger amounts of money. Erect the proper guardrails, and stocks can teach your emerg­ing adults valu­able lessons.</p>
    <p>THE RIGHT AC­COUNT</p>
    <p>It may be tempt­ing for par­ents to sim­ply open a reg­u­lar ac­count and trade with their chil­dren, but a bet­ter op­tion may be a cus­to­dial ac­count, which an adult sets up for a per­son who is not yet 18.</p>
    <p>It may come with lower taxes on any gains, although the over­all bal­ance is sub­ject to the cal­cu­la­tions of col­lege fi­nan­cial aid ex­am­in­ers. Ask ques­tions about trad­ing com­mis­sions, ac­count fees and any min­i­mum bal­ance re­quire­ments. Also, in­quire about whether you can buy frac­tional shares of in­di­vid­ual stocks that may have high prices for even a sin­gle share.</p>
    <p>THE RIGHT RULES</p>
    <p>There are some guide­lines that you as a par­ent, rel­a­tive or men­tor ought to set. Stick to ba­sics for the first few years, which means no short sales, op­tions or use of debt to buy on mar­gin.</p>
    <p>Then there are the in­vest­ment firms’ rules, which adults some­times ig­nore. Charles Sch­wab, Fi­delity and TD Amer­i­trade had a pretty much unan­i­mous re­frain: Don’t give chil­dren the ac­count pass­words so they can trade on their own. And if you do, don’t come run­ning to us for help if they make some gonzo bet that doesn’t work out.</p>
    <p>SKIN IN THE GAME</p>
    <p>Like so many new­bie in­vestors in the 1990s, I was set on a straight path by col­umns from The Wall Street Jour­nal’s Jonathan Cle­ments, who used his own chil­dren as guinea pigs in de­light­ful ways.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view last week, he re­minded me of one failed test, in</p>
    <p>which he doled out a bit of money and then held a mu­tual-fund-pick­ing con­test. His son lost to his dad and his sis­ter, but he didn’t seem to care or learn all that much from the ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Best, then, to have kids in­vest money they have earned – so they can re­call the hours of toil it took to as­sem­ble their lit­tle all.</p>
    <p>SET A GOAL</p>
    <p>In a spir­ited Twit­ter ex­change and fol­low-up ar­ti­cle in June, Morn­ingstar’s di­rec­tor of per­sonal fi­nance Chris­tine Benz ex­pressed se­ri­ous reser­va­tions about buy­ing in­di­vid­ual stocks if you’re a new in­vestor. Peo­ple who in­vest in them, af­ter all, tend not to earn as much over time as those who just put</p>
    <p>their money in a mu­tual or ex­change-traded fund that owns scores of in­di­vid­ual stocks.</p>
    <p>Why not have novices in­vest in in­dex funds from the get-go?</p>
    <p>Well, that can be bor­ing. Also, in­di­vid­ual stocks get teenagers think­ing about larger eco­nomic forces: Why is this com­pany per­form­ing bet­ter than an­other? And the dizzy­ing losses that are more likely with in­di­vid­ual stocks can teach a valu­able early les­son.</p>
    <p>When Ms Benz and I chat­ted re­cently, we agreed on this: Any stock in­vest­ment must be­gin with defin­ing the point of the ex­er­cise. And that de­pends on the teenager, too.</p>
    <p>“What re­ally got me stoked was achiev­ing a goal,” Ms Benz pointed out. A shorter-term ob­jec­tive like sav­ing for a bi­cy­cle prob­a­bly would have mo­ti­vated her to take less in­vest­ment risk, not more. That would also have had her avoid­ing in­di­vid­ual stocks.</p>
    <p>THE UP­PER LIM­ITS</p>
    <p>One down­side of teen stock own­er­ship is the up­side.</p>
    <p>Big gains can make you feel in­vin­ci­ble. It is a real dan­ger now, given how well some tech­nol­ogy stocks have per­formed of late.</p>
    <p>Mr Cle­ments has a sug­ges­tion: Set a limit on gains in any stock. Once past that point, sell enough to cap­ture all the win­nings and put them in a ba­sic in­dex fund.</p>
    <p>Then you have an ex­per­i­ment cook­ing, in which the money that you have left in the stock faces off against the new fund. That fund will zigzag far less than the stock, most likely. Hope­fully it ends up as the bet­ter per­former, re­in­forc­ing the les­son that di­ver­si­fy­ing your in­vest­ments is a smart move and cre­ates less anx­i­ety, too.</p>
    <p>But even if sin­gle-stock gun­sling­ing does net a wind­fall for a young in­vestor, that ex­po­sure to mu­tual funds will count for some­thing.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, they make up the back­bone of work­place re­tire­ment plans, and those funds are the best routes to long-term fi­nan­cial se­cu­rity for most in­vestors. Own­ing a bit of stock should also help young in­vestors know what to do by the time they en­ter the work­ing world.</p>
    <p>“With any luck, it will be the trig­ger that ex­cites them about in­vest­ing and turns them into some­one in­vest­ing in the stock mar­ket for the rest of their lives,” Mr Cle­ments said. “If you can do that, the pay­off is huge.”</p>
