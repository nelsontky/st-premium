    <p>LON­DON • Sec­ond-tier Wi­gan Ath­letic will re­ceive a 12-point de­duc­tion af­ter their fi­nal game of the sea­son at home to Ful­ham to­day, the English Foot­ball League (EFL) has con­firmed.</p>
    <p>The sanc­tion was im­posed af­ter the Cham­pi­onship club went into ad­min­is­tra­tion on July 1, com­ing just four weeks af­ter they were sold from one Hong Kong-based com­pany to an­other, both of which were ma­jor­ity-owned by pro­fes­sional poker player and busi­ness­man Stan­ley Choi.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness­man Au-ye­ung Wai Kay has since re­placed Choi as the ma­jor­ity share­holder of Next Leader Fund (NFL), which pur­chased Wi­gan from In­ter­na­tional En­ter­tain­ment Cor­po­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to var­i­ous Bri­tish me­dia, there is spec­u­la­tion that NLF placed a bet on the club to be rel­e­gated, and it is al­leged that the own­ers placed Wi­gan into ad­min­is­tra­tion so a points de­duc­tion would en­sure they drop to League One.</p>
    <p>The Lat­ics are 13th in the stand­ings, but only 10 points above third-from-bot­tom Lu­ton (48).</p>
    <p>That means the points de­duc­tion could rel­e­gate them even if they win. But Wi­gan do have the right of ap­peal, as do Sh­effield Wednesday, who stand to lose up to a max­i­mum of 21 points af­ter be­ing ac­cused of an ag­gra­vated breach of the EFL’s profit and sus­tain­abil­ity rules.</p>
    <p>The Owls are 16th on 56 points and will go down should the harsh­est pun­ish­ment be ap­plied.</p>
    <p>An EFL state­ment con­firmed the clubs who fin­ish 22nd, 23rd and 24th (once Wi­gan’s 12-point de­duc­tion has taken ef­fect) would be rel­e­gated “sub­ject to the res­o­lu­tion of any on­go­ing pro­ceed­ings”. It added: “In­de­pen­dent Dis­ci­plinary Com­mis­sions are well aware of the chal­lenges for any club sub­ject to pro­ceed­ings, and the need for clar­ity for fi­nan­cial and op­er­a­tional plan­ning pur­poses.”</p>
    <p>Since their rel­e­ga­tion from the Premier League in the 2012-13 sea­son, Wi­gan have bounced be­tween the sec­ond and third di­vi­sions, but man­ager Paul Cook has called on his play­ers to de­cide the club’s future on the pitch.</p>
    <p>He told local daily Wi­gan Post: “There’s prob­a­bly more pride in and around this foot­ball club than there has been for some time, and that’s the most im­por­tant thing head­ing into Wednesday.”</p>
