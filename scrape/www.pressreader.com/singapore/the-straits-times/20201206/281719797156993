    <p>(Ethiopia) • Mr Don­ald Trump’s de­ci­sion to pull US troops out of So­ma­lia in the wan­ing days of his pres­i­dency has trig­gered dis­may from some So­ma­lis, who ap­pealed to the in­com­ing US pres­i­dent to re­verse the de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>“The US de­ci­sion to pull troops out of So­ma­lia at this crit­i­cal stage in the suc­cess­ful fight against AlShabaab and their global ter­ror­ist net­work is ex­tremely re­gret­table,” Se­na­tor Ayub Is­mail Yusuf told Reuters yes­ter­day in a state­ment, re­fer­ring to the Al Qaeda-linked Al-Shabaab in­sur­gency.</p>
    <p>“US troops have made a huge con­tri­bu­tion and had great im­pact on the train­ing and op­er­a­tional ef­fec­tive­ness of So­mali sol­diers,” said Mr Yusuf, a mem­ber of So­ma­lia’s Se­nate For­eign Af­fairs Com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>He tagged US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den in a tweet crit­i­cis­ing Mr Trump’s de­ci­sion on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The So­mali gov­ern­ment could not be reached for com­ment yes­ter­day on the US move to with­draw al­most all its roughly 700 troops from the coun­try by Jan 15.</p>
    <p>The with­drawal from So­ma­lia fol­lowed Mr Trump’s or­ders to re­duce the Amer­i­can pres­ence in Afghanista­n and Iraq, and re­flected his long-stand­ing de­sire to end long-run­ning mil­i­tary en­gage­ments against Is­lamic in­sur­gen­cies in failed and frag­ile coun­tries in Africa and the Mid­dle East, a grind­ing mis­sion that has spread since the Sept 11, 2001, at­tacks.</p>
    <p>But the Pen­tagon, in an­nounc­ing the pull­out, stressed that the US “is not with­draw­ing or dis­en­gag­ing from Africa”.</p>
    <p>It said: “We re­main com­mit­ted to our African part­ners and en­dur­ing sup­port through a whole-of­gov­ern­ment ap­proach.”</p>
    <p>So­ma­lia’s frag­ile in­ter­na­tion­ally backed gov­ern­ment is due to hold par­lia­men­tary elec­tions this month and na­tional elec­tions in early Fe­bru­ary, a pre­cur­sor to the planned draw­down of the 17,000-strong African Union peace­keep­ing force.</p>
    <p>US troops in So­ma­lia have mostly been sup­port­ing So­mali spe­cial forces known as Danab in op­er­a­tions against Al-Shabaab, whose at­tacks in na­tions like Kenya and Uganda have killed hun­dreds of civil­ians, in­clud­ing Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>Danab punches above its weight be­cause reg­u­lar forces are of­ten poorly trained and equipped, fre­quently desert their posts or be­come en­meshed in power strug­gles be­tween the na­tional and re­gional gov­ern­ments.</p>
    <p>If the with­drawal is per­ma­nent, “it will have a huge toll on coun­tert­er­ror­ism ef­forts”, said Colonel Ahmed Ab­dul­lahi Sheikh, who served for three years un­til 2019 as the Danab com­man­der.</p>
    <p>He fought along­side US forces, he said, ad­ding that dur­ing his com­mand, two Amer­i­cans and more than a hun­dred of his own men had died. Both US and So­mali forces are op­posed to the with­drawal, he said.</p>
    <p>The US pro­gramme to ex­pand Danab to 3,000 men was sup­posed to con­tinue un­til 2027, Col Sheikh said, but its fu­ture is un­clear.</p>
    <p>Air strikes will likely con­tinue from bases in Kenya and Dji­bouti, which could also pro­vide a launch­pad for cross-bor­der op­er­a­tions. Rights group Amnesty In­ter­na­tional says the air strikes have killed at least 16 civil­ians in the past three years.</p>
    <p>The US with­drawal comes at a tur­bu­lent time in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Ethiopia, which is a ma­jor troop con­trib­u­tor to the peace­keep­ing forces and has thou­sands more troops in So­ma­lia bi­lat­er­ally, is dis­tracted by an in­ter­nal con­flict that broke out last month. It has al­ready dis­armed hun­dreds of its peace­keep­ers in So­ma­lia.</p>
    <p>So­ma­lia has been riven by civil war since 1991, but the en­try of the peace­keep­ing force in 2008 helped in­cu­bate fledg­ling gov­ern­ment struc­tures that al­lowed for grad­ual re­forms of the mil­i­tary, such as a bio­met­ric sys­tem to pay sol­diers and the for­ma­tion of Danab.</p>
    <p>But many prob­lems with the So­mali mil­i­tary re­main, in­clud­ing cor­rup­tion and po­lit­i­cal in­ter­fer­ence. Per­haps a with­drawal of US forces will force So­ma­lia to con­front them, said Col Sheikh. Or per­haps it will make them worse.</p>
