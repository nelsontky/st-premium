    <p>Ital­ian side Napoli’s San Paolo Sta­dium has been of­fi­cially re­named the Diego Armando Maradona Sta­dium af­ter the late Ar­gentina foot­baller who led them to their only two Serie A ti­tles and the Uefa Cup, the city’s coun­cil said on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Maradona died in his sleep on Nov 25 af­ter a heart at­tack at his home in Buenos Aires, less than a month af­ter his 60th birth­day.</p>
    <p>The city coun­cil ap­proved the res­o­lu­tion pro­posed by Naples Mayor Luigi de Mag­istris to change the sta­dium’s name to hon­our the World Cup-win­ning great, who scored 115 goals in seven years at the club.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been in talks with lo­cal au­thor­i­ties for the past 17 years, I’ve al­ways asked to buy the sta­dium and re­name it ‘ Diego Armando Maradona’,” Napoli pres­i­dent Aure­lio de Lau­ren­tiis told Sky in Italy.</p>
    <p>“If then, for tra­di­tion, we will need to call it both ‘San Paolo’ and ‘Maradona’ so be it. It won’t change much, but it’s only right that Maradona has this recog­ni­tion. Even if we were to build a whole new sta­dium, I would name it like that.</p>
    <p>“Your years here re­main in­deli­ble in the mem­o­ries of the peo­ple of Naples – sym­bolic of a cov­eted redemp­tion and yearned-for res­ur­rec­tion.”</p>
    <p>Maradona signed for Napoli in 1984 and helped the club con­quer the north­ern teams such as Ju­ven­tus, AC Mi­lan and In­ter Mi­lan – the aris­to­cratic es­tab­lish­ment of Ital­ian foot­ball – and briefly turned Serie A on its head.</p>
    <p>Back home in Ar­gentina, he could also have a street in Buenos Aires named af­ter him un­der a pro­posal put for­ward on Fri­day by city coun­cil law­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>They want to put his name to part of an av­enue lead­ing to the sta­dium of Ar­genti­nos Ju­niors, the team for whom Maradona be­gan his ca­reer at the age of 15. That arena was al­ready named af­ter him in 2004.</p>
    <p>The new bill also aims to cre­ate a “tourist, sport­ing and cul­tural cir­cuit” in a 30-block area around the sta­dium as a “per­ma­nent trib­ute” to Maradona in the area where he started as a foot­baller.</p>
    <p>“Noth­ing can equal the joy and hap­pi­ness that Maradona gave the peo­ple of Ar­gentina. But we think that this cul­tural and sport­ing cir­cuit would be es­sen­tial to keep­ing him alive, now and for­ever,” said city coun­cil­lor Clau­dio Mor­resi, the spon­sor of the leg­is­la­tion.</p>
