        TOPOF THE NEWS A8 THE STRAITS TIMES THURSDAY, AUGUST 6, 2020 | | | Coronaviru­s pandemic Hong Kong Jokowi, ministers get flak for not wearing masks Nine more deaths amid 3,462 new infections 3 local transmissi­ons as city battles third wave • • • Indonesia recorded 1,815 new coronaviru­s infections yesterday, bringing the total number of cases in the South-east Asian country to 116,871, data by the country’s Health Ministry showed.
There were 64 additional deaths, taking the overall number of fatalities to 5,452, the data showed.
Indonesia’s cumulative tally meant it still has the most cases among the 10 South-east Asian countries, with the Philippine­s reporting 3,462 new cases to bring the total to 115,980.
Separately, the Indonesian State Palace vowed compliance with health protocol on Tuesday after President Joko Widodo and several ministers faced criticism on social media for not wearing masks in photograph­s taken during a Cabinet meeting on Monday.
In the photos posted on the Cabinet Secretaria­t’s Twitter account, Mr Joko was seen without a mask while leading a limited Cabinet meeting discussing the Covid-19 pandemic and the national economic recovery at Merdeka Palace in Jakarta. Six ministers sat around him, also with no masks.
Social media users took to Twitter to remind Mr Joko and his ministers to wear masks during the pandemic. The Philippine­s’ Health Ministry yesterday reported 3,462 new coronaviru­s infections and nine additional deaths in the country, a day after a lockdown was implemente­d in Metro Manila and other virus hot spots.
In a bulletin, the ministry said total infections had risen to 115,980, putting the tally just behind Indonesia’s 116,871 cases, which is the highest in East Asia.
Covid-19 deaths in the Philippine­s have reached 2,123.
Meanwhile, Vietnam’s Health Ministry yesterday reported 41 new cases, taking the country’s total to 713 infections, with eight deaths. Forty of the new cases are linked to Danang, the new epicentre where Vietnam on July 25 detected its first locally transmitte­d infections in more than three months.
The outbreak in Vietnam has spread to two more provinces, the country’s health minister said.
However, Vietnam’s Covid-19 task force declared the contagion “under control” in Danang.
There have been 264 cases since the virus resurfaced in Danang, which include all eight of the country’s Covid-19 deaths. Infections have since been found in at least 10 locations in Vietnam. Hong Kong reported 85 new coronaviru­s cases yesterday, including three that were locally transmitte­d, as the authoritie­s battled to control a third wave of the outbreak which has seen a resurgence in infections over the past month.
Since late January, around 3,700 people have been infected in Hong Kong, 43 of whom have died. Two weeks ago, there were only 10 fatalities.
Yesterday’s figure was up marginally from Tuesday’s 80 cases. Officials warned that case numbers could surge.
While the situation in Hong Kong is not yet under control, the lower numbers are a reprieve after local cases topped 100 in 11 of the previous 12 days.
Hong Kong is battling a fierce resurgence that is straining its healthcare infrastruc­ture and testing capacity, with isolation beds and wards in public hospitals nearing their limits.
After opening two community isolation centres that can host 350 and 500 patients with mild symptoms, the government is studying where and how to open more makeshift hospitals when needed.
