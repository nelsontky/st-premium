    <p>It looks like Chi­nese ac­tress Fan Bing­bing’s le­gal woes are not over, two years af­ter her tax-eva­sion scan­dal.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Chi­nese me­dia re­ported that Fan, who has yet to make a full re­turn to the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try, has been sued by Le Vi­sion Pic­tures, with the case to be heard on Sept 14.</p>
    <p>Le Vi­sion is su­ing Wuxi Aimeishen Movie & Cul­ture, a com­pany un­der Fan and her mother Zhuang Chuan­mei, due to con­trac­tual dis­putes, ac­cord­ing to in­for­ma­tion on the Chi­nese courts’ web­site.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese me­dia said the case was over the movie L.O.R.D: Leg­end Of Rav­aging Dy­nas­ties 2, which stars Fan, singer Kris Wu and Hong Kong ac­tor Wil­liam Chan.</p>
    <p>Le Vi­sion is one of the in­vestors in the fan­tasy movie, which was sched­uled to be screened in July 2018. It was held over af­ter Fan was ac­cused in May 2018 over her ink­ing of so-called “yin-and-yang con­tracts” to avoid pay­ing taxes.</p>
    <p>She then dis­ap­peared from pub­lic view for sev­eral months be­fore resur­fac­ing on so­cial me­dia af­ter an in­ves­ti­ga­tion by the Chi­nese tax au­thor­i­ties found her guilty of tax eva­sion.</p>
    <p>She was or­dered to pay more than 800 mil­lion yuan (S$159 mil­lion) in over­due taxes and fines.</p>
    <p>Last week, Chi­nese me­dia re­ported that the ac­tress has also been sued by a com­pany un­der Chi­nese ac­tor Wu Xi­ubo, with the case first men­tioned on Aug 10.</p>
    <p>Khor­gos Buer Cul­ture Me­dia is seek­ing dam­ages over con­trac­tual dis­putes re­port­edly re­lat­ing to tele­vi­sion se­rial Leg­end Of Ba Qing and movie Sky Hunter (2017).</p>
    <p>Leg­end Of Ba Qing is an epic his­tor­i­cal drama that stars Fan and Chi­nese ac­tor Gao Yunx­i­ang.</p>
    <p>The show was sched­uled to air in April 2018, but was canned af­ter Gao was ar­rested in Aus­tralia in March that year, when a wo­man ac­cused him of sex­ual as­sault. Fan’s tax-eva­sion scan­dal did not help mat­ters. Gao was ac­quit­ted in March this year.</p>
    <p>The case over Sky Hunter, which was di­rected by Fan’s ex-fi­ance Li Chen and stars both of them, was al­legedly due to fi­nan­cial dis­putes.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Fan, who turns 38 on Sept 16, did not seem per­turbed by the two cases, as she posted on Weibo pho­tos of her­self at­tend­ing di­rec­tor Jia Zhangke’s art ex­hi­bi­tion late on Mon­day. She also posted pho­tos of her­self with Jia and ac­tors like Liao Fan and Song Jia.</p>
