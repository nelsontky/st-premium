    <p>All med­i­cal stu­dents at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) will be taught pa­tient safety through a vir­tual re­al­ity (VR) game, a move prompted by the Covid-19 so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules.</p>
    <p>The game, called PA­tient Safety aS In­ter-Pro­fes­sional Train­ing (PASS-IT), will use VR to get all 1,500 of them ac­quainted with the proper pro­ce­dures in op­er­at­ing the­atres.</p>
    <p>It was de­vel­oped by the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (NUS Medicine). The school has 12 such VR sta­tions. Each has a 15-minute game with var­i­ous med­i­cal sce­nar­ios that will re­quire the stu­dents to “act out” the stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures.</p>
    <p>These range from how to check for a pa­tient’s con­sent and ver­ify their iden­tity, as well as the cor­rect ways to han­dle sur­gi­cal tools and what must be done if a team mem­ber ac­ci­den­tally cuts him­self.</p>
    <p>NUS Medicine said yes­ter­day that such skills have tra­di­tion­ally been taught in clin­i­cal set­tings, in which med­i­cal stu­dents are brought to a pa­tient’s bed­side to ob­serve how doc­tors work.</p>
    <p>But with the Covid-19 si­t­u­a­tion, “stu­dents have been re­moved from these set­tings of prac­ti­cal learn­ing due to the risk of ex­pos­ing them to aerosol-gen­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures”, it added in its state­ment.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Al­fred Kow, as­sis­tant dean of ed­u­ca­tion of NUS Medicine, said: “This VR sys­tem is a good tool to help the stu­dents con­sol­i­date their learn­ing de­spite in­creased clin­i­cal re­stric­tions.”</p>
    <p>In PASS-IT, stu­dents don VR head­sets and wield hand-held con­trollers as their move­ments are ob­served by ed­u­ca­tors who guide them.</p>
    <p>Their phys­i­cal move­ments and ac­tions are tracked and dis­played in real time on a screen, al­low­ing their teach­ers to see and eval­u­ate them.</p>
    <p>They also have to at­tend an hour­long les­son be­fore the game, as well as a short de­brief ses­sion af­ter.</p>
    <p>PASS-IT was de­vel­oped late last year and has been in trial for the past two months.</p>
    <p>De­pend­ing on their area of spe­cial­i­sa­tion, stu­dents will go through the game in the third, fourth or fifth year.</p>
    <p>NUS Medicine said stu­dents who have com­pleted the game showed im­proved un­der­stand­ing of the steps that have to be taken in an op­er­at­ing the­atre.</p>
    <p>Un­der­grad­u­ate Eleanor Loh, 20, said that while it was not the first time she and her course­mates had been told of the pro­ce­dures fea­tured in PASS-IT, it was the first time they had to phys­i­cally act them out.</p>
    <p>Even though it was a vir­tual ex­pe­ri­ence, Miss Loh, a third-year stu­dent, said it was bet­ter than sit­ting through a lec­ture or con­ven­tional les­son.</p>
    <p>“Play­ing the game gave me a good un­der­stand­ing of the flow of these pro­ce­dures and how they work. And from act­ing out these pro­ce­dures, they tend to stick,” she said.</p>
