    <p>M1 has apol­o­gised to its cus­tomers for a fi­bre broad­band outage yes­ter­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>The outage – the sec­ond in a month – was ex­pe­ri­enced just af­ter 10am by users is­land­wide, in­clud­ing those in Wood­lands, Yishun, Pasir Ris, Tiong Bahru and Hougang. The dis­rup­tion was due to a faulty equip­ment card sup­port­ing its fi­bre broad­band ser­vice, which the telco has re­placed, M1 said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Given the re­cur­rence, we will be re­view­ing our com­plete broad­band tech­ni­cal architectu­re to pre­vent the oc­cur­rence of such in­ci­dents,” M1 added.</p>
    <p>On Dec 4, M1 users were also hit by a fi­bre broad­band outage that lasted over four hours.</p>
    <p>The telco added in its state­ment that its en­gi­neers and re­cov­ery team were im­me­di­ately ac­ti­vated to re­solve the is­sue af­ter it re­ceived re­ports of the dis­rup­tion at 11am. Ser­vice was pro­gres­sively re­stored.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Down-de­tec­tor web­site that logs In­ter­net out­ages, M1 started hav­ing prob­lems at 10.08am, with the num­ber of re­ports peak­ing at more than 12,000 at about 11.30am.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, M1 had two other dis­rup­tions which lasted for al­most 30 hours in to­tal from May 12 to 13.</p>
    <p>The first was due to a cor­rupted pro­file data­base in the telco’s broad­band net­work gate­way, while the sec­ond was caused by a soft­ware fault in its net­work equip­ment.</p>
    <p>M1 was fined $400,000 by the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Author­ity in Septem­ber for those ser­vice dis­rup­tions.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the outage yes­ter­day morn­ing, M1 users took to so­cial me­dia, in­clud­ing the telco’s Face­book page, to voice their is­sues.</p>
    <p>Toa Payoh res­i­dent Ken Kwee, 47, said his broad­band con­nec­tion was down from 10am. Mr Kwee, who works in sales, added that de­spite restart­ing his router five times, his con­nec­tion was still cut off as at 1pm.</p>
    <p>“I was in a Zoom meet­ing with my clients and due to this tech­ni­cal glitch, I had to waste 15 min­utes of their time,” he said.</p>
    <p>Pung­gol res­i­dent Ngee Key Chan, 48, also had con­nec­tion is­sues. The ca­reer tran­si­tions coach had to restart his Mi­crosoft Teams meet­ing, but has no plans to switch telco.</p>
    <p>“I have been with M1 for eight years and this is the first year when there have been se­vere out­ages,” he said.</p>
