    <p>Ja­pan’s Chief Cabi­net Sec­re­tary Yoshi­hide Suga, known af­fec­tion­ately as “Suga-chan” to his close friends, has risen from the straw­berry fields of win­try Akita pre­fec­ture to be on the cusp of the pinnacle of Ja­panese pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>He was born on Dec 6, 1948 in the town of Ogachi (now part of Yuzawa city, which is not to be con­fused with the more well-known Yuzawa ski re­sort town in Ni­igata) in moun­tain­ous Akita, the north­east re­gion from where the dog breed of the same name orig­i­nated.</p>
    <p>His fa­ther, Wasaburo, who died in 2010 at the age of 92, was a straw­berry farmer. The young Yoshi­hide helped out on the farm.</p>
    <p>“I’m just an or­di­nary per­son,” Mr Suga, now 71 and the front run­ner in the race to suc­ceed out­go­ing Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe, said last week as he launched his elec­toral cam­paign. “I en­tered pol­i­tics with no lo­cal con­nec­tions nor blood ties.”</p>
    <p>If he pre­vails, as widely ex­pected, he will be Ja­pan’s first prime min­is­ter born in Akita, and the first Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party (LDP) leader with no po­lit­i­cal blood since 1989.</p>
    <p>The fa­ther of three sons – all salaried work­ers with no in­ter­est in pol­i­tics – fol­lows a strict dis­ci­pline, wak­ing up at 5am and read­ing all the ma­jor dailies ev­ery morn­ing.</p>
    <p>He has a sweet spot for pancakes but has zero tol­er­ance for al­co­hol, and stays healthy by do­ing 100 situps ev­ery morn­ing and night.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga also takes a 30- to 40-minute walk ev­ery morn­ing, in a suit, in case he needs to rush back to work.</p>
    <p>He is now Ja­pan’s long­est-serv­ing top gov­ern­ment spokesman, a role he has held since De­cem­ber 2012 when Mr Abe be­came prime min­is­ter for the sec­ond time.</p>
    <p>He wields tremen­dous po­lit­i­cal and bu­reau­cratic in­flu­ence, tak­ing an ac­tive man­age­rial role in gov­ern­ment, and is seen as a pol­icy maven within the LDP.</p>
    <p>As a teenager, Yoshi­hide, the third of four sib­lings and the el­der son, was al­ready am­bi­tious – and au­da­cious. Find­ing the prospect of spend­ing his life in a re­mote val­ley un­ap­peal­ing – just go­ing to school had meant a two-hour jour­ney by bus and train each day – he packed his bags and left for Tokyo at the age of 17.</p>
    <p>In do­ing so, he de­fied his par­ents’ ex­pec­ta­tions that he would take over the straw­berry farm. (De­spite the act of re­bel­lion, he was fil­ial and would reg­u­larly re­turn home, and also take his par­ents on trips.)</p>
    <p>He knew no one in Tokyo and toiled through a se­ries of odd jobs to pay his way through univer­sity. Among other things, he has worked at a cor­ru­gated card­board fac­tory, and as a night watch­man, a news­pa­per run­ner, and a dolly-cart driver at the Tsuk­iji fish mar­ket.</p>
    <p>LAW, THEN POL­I­TICS</p>
    <p>He en­rolled in the law fac­ulty at Ho­sei Univer­sity, where he picked up karate, as it was the cheap­est op­tion at the time. Af­ter grad­u­a­tion, he toyed with be­com­ing a salaried worker, but knew it was “pol­i­tics (that) makes the world go round”.</p>
    <p>But the young Mr Suga knew no one in pol­i­tics. He got his foot in the door by ask­ing his school’s ca­reer cen­tre to con­nect him with po­lit­i­cal alumni.</p>
    <p>“No mat­ter how harsh the win­ter is, spring will come and the snow will melt,” Mr Suga was quoted in a Nikkei ar­ti­cle as say­ing. “The coun­try­side has taught me per­se­ver­ance be­fore I even re­alised it.”</p>
    <p>His first job in pol­i­tics lasted 11 years, as the aide to LDP law­maker Hikos­aburo Okonogi.</p>
    <p>There, he met his wife Mariko, the sis­ter of a col­league. He quit in 1986 to run for the Yoko­hama City Coun­cil, oust­ing the LDP in­cum­bent who had ac­cused him of be­ing a green­horn with no com­mit­ment.</p>
    <p>But Mr Suga did not shrink from the chal­lenge. He cam­paigned door to door on foot, vis­it­ing 30,000 homes and wear­ing out six pairs of shoes.</p>
    <p>He served on the coun­cil for nine years be­fore set­ting his sights on na­tional pol­i­tics. In 1996, he en­tered the Diet at the age of 47, which is con­sid­ered late in Ja­panese pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>He is now into his eighth term as MP of Kana­gawa pre­fec­ture, in a dis­trict that cov­ers Yoko­hama.</p>
    <p>He has been cred­ited for his em­pa­thy, and in­vented the prac­tice of tsu­ji­dachi, a cam­paign­ing style where can­di­dates ad­dress vot­ers in front of busy train sta­tions.</p>
    <p>Buck­ing the norm of aloof politi­cians whose i ndoor ral­lies are geared to­wards sup­port­ers, he per­son­ally greeted com­muters and handed out sur­veys to find out their key ar­eas of con­cern.</p>
    <p>He was in­ter­nal af­fairs min­is­ter in Mr Abe’s first term as PM from 2006 to 2007, and has been a loyalist since. Af­ter Mr Abe abruptly quit, he lost his stand­ing among many LDP col­leagues but Mr Suga vowed to make Mr Abe PM again.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga’s ca­chet surged on April 1 last year, when he an­nounced on tele­vi­sion the name of Ja­pan’s new im­pe­rial era Reiwa (beau­ti­ful har­mony). The act gave him the col­lo­quial nick­name Reiwa ojisan, or Un­cle Reiwa.</p>
    <p>He has been cred­ited for his em­pa­thy, and in­vented the prac­tice of tsu­ji­dachi, a cam­paign­ing style where can­di­dates ad­dress vot­ers in front of busy train sta­tions. Buck­ing the norm of aloof politi­cians whose in­door ral­lies are geared to­wards sup­port­ers, he per­son­ally greeted com­muters and handed out sur­veys to find out their key ar­eas of con­cern.</p>
    <p>STRONG WILL</p>
    <p>Do­mes­tic is­sues are his forte, but a rare diplo­matic trip to meet United States Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence the fol­low­ing month fu­elled talk that Mr Suga was be­ing groomed for the top job. Still he be­trayed no am­bi­tion and con­tin­ued to in­sist that he was happy be­ing Mr Abe’s trusty right-hand man, un­til the lat­ter’s abrupt res­ig­na­tion as prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga said i n a cam­paign speech last week: “Even if you don’t have money or con­nec­tions, you can do any­thing through strong will and hard work.”</p>
