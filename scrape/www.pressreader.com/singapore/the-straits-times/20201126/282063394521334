    <p>As a reg­u­lar run­ner, I of­ten see a fam­ily of wild boars in Pasir Ris Coast In­dus­trial Park 6. This area can be crowded with kite fliers and re­mote-con­trolled car rac­ers, who drive there with all their para­pher­na­lia.</p>
    <p>They spend many hours set­ting up, play­ing and chat­ting. They also have food and drinks with them.</p>
    <p>The wild boars, too, of­ten show up on the other side of the drain where the cars are parked. De­spite a prom­i­nent sign ask­ing peo­ple not to feed wild an­i­mals, the crowds do feed them gen­er­ously.</p>
    <p>As pointed out by the Na­tional Parks Board (NParks) and wildlife ad­vo­cates, an­i­mals once fed tend to re­turn to the same place ex­pect­ing to be fed. Peo­ple may be feed­ing them out of sym­pa­thy or just not to waste the re­main­ing food they have.</p>
    <p>There are also many stray dogs in the area and some­times the dogs and boars fight over the food.</p>
    <p>A few things can be done to pre­vent in­ci­dents like the re­cent one of a wild boar in­jur­ing a woman (Woman in hos­pi­tal af­ter boar at­tack at park in Pasir Ris, Nov 21).</p>
    <p>More warn­ing sign­boards can be in­stalled at the road en­trance to ad­vise peo­ple against feed­ing an­i­mals. There are no waste bins in this area, and a few an­i­mal-proof waste bins should be in­stalled along the road so peo­ple can dis­pose of their left­over food in­stead of feed­ing it to the an­i­mals.</p>
    <p>NParks of­fi­cers should also pa­trol the area around Pasir Ris Coast In­dus­trial Park 6 and Sungei Api Api to en­sure peo­ple fol­low the ad­vice against an­i­mal feed­ing.</p>
    <p>As pointed out by the Na­tional Parks Board and wildlife ad­vo­cates, an­i­mals once fed tend to re­turn to the same place ex­pect­ing to be fed.</p>
