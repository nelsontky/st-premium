    <p>MADRID • Spain has be­come the first coun­try in Western Europe to reg­is­ter 500,000 coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, af­ter a sec­ond surge in cases that co­in­cided with the re­open­ing of schools.</p>
    <p>Health Min­istry data showed a to­tal of 525,549 cases on Mon­day, up from 498,989 last Fri­day, with 2,440 in­fec­tions reg­is­tered over 24 hours.</p>
    <p>Spain up­dates its data retroac­tively, so the lat­est num­bers could be re­vised. Re­cent in­fec­tions have been more com­mon among younger peo­ple who of­ten de­velop no symp­toms thanks to their stronger im­mune sys­tems, and the death rate re­mains far below the March-April peak when daily fa­tal­i­ties rou­tinely ex­ceeded 800.</p>
    <p>De­spite the un­wanted mile­stone, un­like then, hos­pi­tals have enough beds to treat Covid-19 pa­tients. Af­ter a first wave in spring that rav­aged Spain’s el­derly pop­u­la­tion and over­whelmed the hos­pi­tal sys­tem, the au­thor­i­ties brought the out­break un­der con­trol with the help of one of the world’s tough­est lock­downs.</p>
    <p>But as re­stric­tions on move­ment were lifted and mass test­ing be­gan in late June, in­fec­tions rose from a few hun­dred a day to a new peak of over 10,000 around 10 days ago, out­strip­ping other hard-hit na­tions such as France, Bri­tain and Italy. The over­all mor­tal­ity rate since the pan­demic first struck is around 6 per cent in Spain, lower than in Italy, Bri­tain and France.</p>
    <p>Spain re­ported eight new deaths on Mon­day, bring­ing the to­tal to 29,516.</p>
    <p>While dis­count­ing the need for a new na­tion­wide lock­down, Dr Rafael Ben­goa, co-founder of Spain’s In­sti­tute for Health and Strat­egy, said lo­calised con­fine­ments of city neigh­bour­hoods could be­come in­creas­ingly use­ful to con­trol trans­mis­sion. Some Spa­niards think cur­rent re­stric­tions are in­suf­fi­cient.</p>
