    <p>Malaysia’s new­est po­lit­i­cal party led by states­man Tun Dr Ma­hathir Mo­hamad is fac­ing an up­hill bat­tle in a by-election in a ru­ral district in Perak state.</p>
    <p>The Slim state con­stituency, about an hour’s drive north of Kuala Lumpur, is an Umno strong­hold, with the party work­ing well with its part­ner, Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia (PAS), to can­vass for votes on the ground.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir formed Parti Pe­juang Tanah Air (Fight­ers of the Na­tion) ear­lier this month af­ter a bit­ter split from Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia, a party he had co­founded with Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin.</p>
    <p>But with Pe­juang’s reg­is­tra­tion not of­fi­cially ap­proved yet, its can­di­date in Slim is stand­ing in the state polls as an in­de­pen­dent.</p>
    <p>With just one day left be­fore polling to­mor­row, Dr Ma­hathir hit the sleepy town of Slim River yes­ter­day to speak at two po­lit­i­cal ral­lies.</p>
    <p>“The party which I set up with Muhyid­din was to top­ple (for­mer premier) Na­jib Razak. We suc­ceeded be­cause the peo­ple sup­ported us when we said we will oust the un­just Na­jib ad­min­is­tra­tion,” Dr Ma­hathir told about 250 peo­ple at a rally in the heart of a Felda land set­tle­ment.</p>
    <p>“But when we won, we turned around and said we would sup­port Na­jib and he came back. This is a be­trayal,” he added.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir’s Pakatan Hara­pan gov­ern­ment lost power af­ter just 22 months in of­fice, as Tan Sri Muhyid­din and most MPs from his Ber­satu de­fected to form an al­liance with Na­jib’s Umno party and 10 other par­ties.</p>
    <p>At the rally, Dr Ma­hathir warned his party’s can­di­date in Slim not to de­fect.</p>
    <p>“I trust you won’t sell your­self. What is your price?” he asked jok­ingly.</p>
    <p>“If BN of­fers you RM5 mil­lion (S$1.6 mil­lion) to jump, say no,” he said to loud cheers from the au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>A 72-year-old Felda set­tler who de­clined to be named said he will vote for Pe­juang.</p>
    <p>“I used to vote for Umno, but the lead­ers are cor­rupt. They don’t care about the peo­ple, they only think about them­selves,” he claimed.</p>
    <p>An­other Felda set­tler, Mr Abas Mo­hamad, 73, said: “Tun Dr Ma­hathir is my idol. Umno can­not be trusted.”</p>
    <p>The Slim polls are the 12th by­elec­tion since the 2018 gen­eral election.</p>
    <p>The cam­paign has been hit by voter fa­tigue as politi­cians from both sides of the po­lit­i­cal di­vide are con­tin­u­ously bick­er­ing de­spite the coro­n­avirus pan­demic that has caused deep job losses.</p>
    <p>Pe­juang is field­ing Is­lamic lawyer Amir Kusyairi Mohd Tanusi, 38, in the three-way con­test.</p>
    <p>He is fac­ing off against Umno can­di­date Mohd Zaidi Aziz, 43, and in­de­pen­dent can­di­date S. San­tha­rasekaran, a teacher, 44.</p>
    <p>Mr Mohd Zaidi is run­ning un­der the blue flag of the Barisan Na­sional (BN) coali­tion.</p>
    <p>In the 2018 election, BN re­tained the seat de­spite a three-cor­ner fight with its then en­e­mies PAS and Ber­satu.</p>
    <p>BN then net­ted 8,327 votes, against 4,103 gar­nered by PAS and 6,144 won by Ber­satu.</p>
    <p>With Umno and PAS now closely al­lied, ob­servers expect most of the PAS votes to mi­grate to BN.</p>
    <p>And Ber­satu, too, is now part of the rul­ing Perikatan Na­sional par­ties ar­rayed against Pe­juang.</p>
    <p>“Pe­juang is up against Umno, PAS and Ber­satu, in an Umno strong­hold,” po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst Awang Az­man Awang Pawi told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>He added: “If Pe­juang can get 3,000 or more votes, that would be good enough. But if it gets less than that, then Pe­juang will not go far.”</p>
