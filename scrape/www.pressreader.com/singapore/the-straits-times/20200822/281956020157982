    <p>This is home, truly...</p>
    <p>I found my­self ques­tion­ing what Sin­ga­pore meant as a home as ev­ery sin­gle fel­low of­fi­cer cadet around me loudly sang the words of Kit Chan’s fa­mous National Day song dur­ing a route march, while I silently marched ahead, not know­ing a sin­gle word.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing moved to Aus­tralia at the age of eight, then gone on a schol­ar­ship rep­re­sent­ing Aus­tralia to an in­ter­na­tional school in the United States, I ques­tioned how “Sin­ga­porean” I truly was in mo­ments like this.</p>
    <p>An ear­lier mo­ment when my Sin­ga­porean iden­tity came into ques­tion was when my par­ents showed me the en­list­ment let­ter that had come from the Min­istry of De­fence, four days af­ter my ad­mis­sion let­ter to study law in the United King­dom, which could not be de­ferred.</p>
    <p>I found my­self at a chal­leng­ing cross­roads – de­cid­ing be­tween a ca­reer path that I had dreamt of since I was 12, and a duty to a coun­try that had ceased to be home for over 12 years.</p>
    <p>As Hin­dus, my par­ents had in­stilled in me the prin­ci­ple of dharma. Dharma can be un­der­stood as liv­ing in align­ment with our higher val­ues, which also con­sti­tutes the duty we have to our fam­ily, coun­try, global com­mu­nity and en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>Though it ap­peared to be a chal­leng­ing de­ci­sion, it was clear be­cause it had been 18 years in the mak­ing. I tore up my ad­mis­sion let­ter and re­turned to Sin­ga­pore to serve full-time national ser­vice be­cause com­pro­mis­ing on my prin­ci­ples by not serv­ing was train­ing my­self to make moral com­pro­mises when I knew the right – but more dif­fi­cult – path.</p>
    <p>Where I know I must be...</p>
    <p>Ten years later, hav­ing worked in the United Na­tions in New York, in cor­po­rate law in Lon­don and Syd­ney, and im­pact in­vest­ment in Mel­bourne, it is dharma which once again brings me home to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Dharma shaped my de­ci­sion to leave the se­cu­rity of cor­po­rate law to set up an ad­vi­sory firm fo­cused on im­pact in­vest­ment so I could serve peo­ple and the en­vi­ron­ment through my work. Im­pact in­vest­ments are in­vest­ments made with the in­ten­tion to gen­er­ate pos­i­tive and mea­sur­able so­cial and en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact along­side a fi­nan­cial re­turn.</p>
    <p>The chal­lenges Asia faces in­clude cli­mate change, rapid ur­ban­i­sa­tion, an age­ing pop­u­la­tion and the rise of car­diometabol­ic dis­eases such as di­a­betes, stroke and heart fail­ure, which are the lead­ing causes of death and dis­abil­ity in both Sin­ga­pore as well as the re­gion. To achieve the United Na­tions’ Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Goals, there is an es­ti­mated</p>
    <p>US$3 tril­lion (S$4.1 tril­lion) to US$5 tril­lion global fund­ing gap.</p>
    <p>These pro­found chal­lenges and the scale at which they are grow­ing de­mand re­sources be­yond those of gov­ern­ments and de­vel­op­ment fi­nance in­sti­tu­tions. While it is not a panacea, im­pact in­vest­ment could pro­vide a valu­able com­ple­ment in ad­dress­ing these chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>As a port city, Sin­ga­pore has played a sig­nif­i­cant role in en­abling trade and the flow of goods. To­day, we are pre­sented with a sig­nif­i­cant op­por­tu­nity to be a global cen­tre in catalysing the flow of cap­i­tal into im­pact in­vest­ment in the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion. It is the op­por­tu­nity to shape this and the duty I feel to max­imise my pos­i­tive con­tri­bu­tion that has brought me home.</p>
    <p>Where my dreams wait for me...</p>
    <p>While we are still work­ing through our own chal­lenges, Sin­ga­pore’s fun­da­men­tal trans­for­ma­tion from in­de­pen­dence has pro­vided valu­able lessons which are per­ti­nent to sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>I now work on a number of im­pact sec­tors, in­clud­ing fi­nanc­ing sus­tain­able smart ci­ties and tran­sit-ori­ented de­vel­op­ment. As I col­lab­o­rate with the in­sti­tu­tions which have played a piv­otal role in</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s trans­for­ma­tion, and as we work on fi­nanc­ing sus­tain­able ur­ban de­vel­op­ment in coun­tries in emerg­ing Asian coun­tries such as In­dia, the lessons we have learnt in our jour­ney over the last 55 years pro­vide valu­able in­sights.</p>
    <p>In­te­grated ur­ban mas­ter-plan­ning, re­source ef­fi­ciency, af­ford­able hous­ing and ac­ces­si­ble mass tran­sit so­lu­tions pro­vide us with a unique ca­pac­ity to shape the de­vel­op­ment of our re­gion in a way that im­proves the lives of peo­ple and the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>Pre­sent­ing this story of</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore be­fore global in­sti­tu­tional in­vestors in New York, Lon­don, Paris and Am­s­ter­dam, I am proud as a Sin­ga­porean to hear the re­gard they have for the progress we have made, and the trust we in­spire when they know that Sin­ga­porean en­ti­ties are at the helm of these projects.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, in health­care, the</p>
    <p>Global Health Im­pact Part­ner­ship that we are co-lead­ing with Dr Ra­jesh Dash at Stan­ford Med­i­cal School will be un­lock­ing US$1 bil­lion to in­vest in out­comes-based fi­nanc­ing to im­prove health out­comes across dis­ease groups, in­clud­ing car­diometabol­ic dis­eases and ma­ter­nal and child health, with a strong fo­cus on Asia.</p>
    <p>In out­comes-based fi­nanc­ing, in­sti­tu­tional in­vestors fi­nance the up­front costs of pre­ven­ta­tive pro­grammes, such as com­mu­nity health work­ers and the pre­ci­sion pre­ven­tion ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence plat­form devel­oped at Stan­ford, and re­alise a re­turn from the sav­ings de­liv­ered to out­come pay­ers. Those out­come pay­ers in­clude govern­ment health schemes, em­ployee health schemes and in­sur­ance com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is cur­rently a front run­ner for the re­gional base for this work, be­cause of the im­pres­sion left on the Stan­ford team by the team at the Eco­nomic</p>
    <p>De­vel­op­ment Board.</p>
    <p>These op­por­tu­ni­ties to serve at scale have been en­abled by be­ing in Sin­ga­pore, and are a re­al­i­sa­tion of the path I set out on when I first left cor­po­rate law to work in im­pact in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>Where the river al­ways flows</p>
    <p>Who knows where the path ahead will take me, but I know that Sin­ga­pore, and all that it rep­re­sents, is a place that I call home.</p>
    <p>The same sense of duty that was in­stilled in me as a Hindu, and as an in­fantry of­fi­cer, guides my com­mit­ment to us­ing im­pact in­vest­ment as a tool to serve the world. It is this spirit, this sense of home that I will carry with me no mat­ter where I go. scal­able so­lu­tions to our global chal­lenges, in­clud­ing health, cli­mate change and ur­ban de­vel­op­ment. He is man­ag­ing part­ner of Global Im­pact Part­ners, an im­pact in­vest­ment ad­vi­sory firm serv­ing peo­ple and the planet. by The Birth­day Col­lec­tive, which puts out an an­nual an­thol­ogy of es­says on chal­lenges and op­por­tu­ni­ties Sin­ga­pore faces. This year’s edi­tion is edited by Selina Chong and Chua Jun Yan.</p>
    <p>The book is be­ing launched to­day from 2pm to 3 pm at the col­lec­tive’s Face­book page www.face­book.com/ the­birth­day­col­lec­tive</p>
