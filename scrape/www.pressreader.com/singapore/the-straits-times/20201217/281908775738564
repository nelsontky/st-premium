    <p>WELLING­TON • Up to a quar­ter of a mil­lion chil­dren, young peo­ple and vul­ner­a­ble adults were abused in New Zealand’s faith­based and state care in­sti­tu­tions in the past sev­eral decades, a pub­lic in­quiry re­vealed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>An in­terim re­port by the Royal Com­mis­sion of In­quiry into his­toric abuse of chil­dren in state care es­ti­mated that up to 256,000 peo­ple were abused be­tween 1950 and last year. This ac­counts for al­most 40 per cent of the 655,000 peo­ple in care dur­ing that pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“The hurt and an­guish that has been caused in New Zealand’s his­tory is in­ex­cus­able,” said Min­is­ter for the Pub­lic Ser­vice Chris Hip­kins, who de­scribed the re­port as a “dif­fi­cult read”.</p>
    <p>The re­port said most sur­vivors were aged be­tween five and 17, but some were as young as nine months and as old as 20. Most were abused over a five- to 10-year pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The abuse in­cluded phys­i­cal as­sault and sex­ual abuse, with staff in some psy­chi­atric in­sti­tu­tions forc­ing male pa­tients to rape fe­male pa­tients. It also in­cluded the im­proper use of med­i­cal pro­ce­dures, in­clud­ing elec­tric shocks on gen­i­tals and legs, im­proper strip searches and vagi­nal ex­am­i­na­tions, and ver­bal and racial slurs.</p>
    <p>“On any as­sess­ment, this is a se­ri­ous and long­stand­ing so­cial prob­lem that needs to be ad­dressed,” the re­port said, ad­ding there was ev­i­dence that abuse con­tin­ued today.</p>
    <p>The re­port comes af­ter pri­vate and pub­lic re­dress hear­ings where sur­vivors bravely nar­rated har­row­ing ac­counts of abuse.</p>
    <p>One Maori sur­vivor, Peter, told the in­quiry he drove a car off a cliff in an at­tempted sui­cide to es­cape the abuse. “I didn’t want to live any­more... if any­body just stopped and looked at why, they would have fig­ured some­thing out, but they didn’t,” he said.</p>
    <p>The re­port ac­knowl­edged that indige­nous Maori chil­dren prob­a­bly suf­fered the most.</p>
