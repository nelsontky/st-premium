    <p>Eight women who have played a sig­nif­i­cant role in Sin­ga­pore’s fight against the Covid-19 pan­demic were hon­oured with Her World’s Women Of The Year award yes­ter­day. This is the first time the mag­a­zine is recog­nis­ing a col­lec­tive group of women in its an­nual awards.</p>
    <p>The win­ners, who have con­trib­uted to the fields of health­care and med­i­cal re­search, were picked as they are ex­em­plary fig­ures of strength, lead­er­ship and in­spi­ra­tion, Her World said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Ong Bi­auw Chi, for ex­am­ple, who is chair­man of the med­i­cal board at Sengkang Gen­eral Hospi­tal, worked on the front lines at the height of the out­break.</p>
    <p>When med­i­cal teams from the hospi­tal were de­ployed to nearby mi­grant worker dor­mi­to­ries, Prof Ong, 58, was seen at­tend­ing to pa­tients per­son­ally.</p>
    <p>The other women at the top of their fields who have led the bat­tle against the coro­n­avirus in­clude Pro­fes­sor Leo Yee Sin, 60, ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases (NCID).</p>
    <p>Colonel Shalini Aru­lanan­dam, 41, chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer of the Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force (SCDF), helps en­sure the safety of med­i­cal per­son­nel re­spond­ing to Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>Dr Sid­ney Yee, 53, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search’s (A*Star) Di­ag­nos­tics Devel­op­ment Hub, led a team that helped to de­velop di­ag­nos­tic tests used by health­care pro­fes­sion­als both lo­cally and glob­ally.</p>
    <p>Dr Hoi Shu Yin, chief nurse at Tan Tock Seng Hospi­tal, was part of a team that over­saw the con­ver­sion of two hospi­tal floors into a ded­i­cated area for Covid-19 pa­tients. Dr Hoi, 41, also helped to equip more than 380 nurses with nec­es­sary skills to sup­port oper­a­tions at the neigh­bour­ing NCID fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>Ms Kather­ine Leong, 49, as­sis­tant direc­tor of nurs­ing at Na­tional Univer­sity Hospi­tal (NUH), led a team that helped set up the Tuas South com­mu­nity care fa­cil­ity for pa­tients with mild or no symp­toms.</p>
    <p>Top row from left: House of­fi­cer Sudesna Roy Chowd­hury, 24; As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Ong Bi­auw Chi, 58; staff nurse Shahi­dah Suhaimy, 30; Ms Kather­ine Leong, 49, NUH as­sis­tant direc­tor of nurs­ing. Bot­tom row, from left: Dr Sid­ney Yee, 53, chief ex­ec­u­tive of A*Star’s Di­ag­nos­tics Devel­op­ment Hub; Prof Leo Yee Sin, 60, NCID ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor; Dr Hoi Shu Yin, 41, chief nurse at Tan Tock Seng Hospi­tal; Colonel Shalini Aru­lanan­dam, 41, SCDF chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>Younger pro­fes­sion­als also made valu­able con­tri­bu­tions.</p>
    <p>Dr Sudesna Roy Chowd­hury, 24, house of­fi­cer at Changi Gen­eral Hospi­tal, de­vel­oped Trans­lateFor.sg, an English-Ben­gali trans­la­tion web­site that helps mi­grant</p>
    <p>work­ers bet­ter com­mu­ni­cate with health­care staff. Ms Shahi­dah Suhaimy, 30, who was do­ing ma­rine con­ser­va­tion work in Thai­land, re­turned to nurs­ing in Sin­ga­pore ear­lier this year to help in the front-line ef­fort.</p>
    <p>The eight women are fea­tured in the 60th an­niver­sary is­sue of the mag­a­zine, which came out yes­ter­day. The awards were or­gan­ised by Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings (SPH).</p>
    <p>Mr Eu­gene Wee, head of SPH Mag­a­zines, said: “As Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>works her way out of the dis­quiet of the pan­demic, we hope our spe­cial group of Women of the Year 2020 will con­tinue to lead and in­flu­ence count­less oth­ers to carve their own unique paths to­wards con­tribut­ing to so­ci­ety.”</p>
