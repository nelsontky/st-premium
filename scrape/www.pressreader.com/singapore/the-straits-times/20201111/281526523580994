    <p>From next Tues­day night, all trav­ellers from higher-risk ar­eas will have to take a poly­merase chain re­ac­tion test (PCR) for Covid-19 within 72 hours be­fore de­part­ing for Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>These trav­ellers will still have to serve a 14-day stay-home no­tice (SHN) af­ter ar­riv­ing and be tested at the end of their quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, only those who have re­cently trav­elled to In­dia, In­done­sia and the Philip­pines have to test neg­a­tive for Covid-19 to en­ter or tran­sit through Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The new re­quire­ment, which aims to re­duce the risk of im­ported cases, is part of Sin­ga­pore’s dou­ble-bar­relled strat­egy to con­tain the virus as the coun­try moves to­wards phase three of its re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>It will take ef­fect at 11.59pm on Nov 17, and does not ap­ply to Sin­ga­pore­ans or per­ma­nent res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>As Sin­ga­pore in­ten­si­fies its test­ing regime, Covid-19 tests will also be made more ac­ces­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, those who are well and do not need to meet spe­cific re­quire­ments – such as pre-de­par­ture or pre-event tests – can­not re­quest a Covid-19 test.</p>
    <p>From Dec 1, any com­pany or per­son who needs to be tested can pay for a PCR test at about 600 clin­ics and pri­vate health­care providers.</p>
    <p>Im­ported cases and com­mu­nity cases are two broad ar­eas of risk that the Gov­ern­ment is mon­i­tor­ing closely, said Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong who co-chairs the Multi-min­istry Task­force han­dling the cri­sis. “On both fronts, we are tak­ing care­ful and con­trolled mea­sures to re­open and to re­sume ac­tiv­i­ties,” he added.</p>
    <p>Re­open­ing Sin­ga­pore’s borders is an ex­is­ten­tial is­sue be­cause of the coun­try’s small size and need to con­nect with the world, he said.</p>
    <p>“It’s not just for eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties, but also for our so­cial and com­mu­nity needs, be­cause we must al­low fam­i­lies to re­unite and we would also want to fa­cil­i­tate the en­try of for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers who are tak­ing care of our loved ones,” Mr Wong said.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers from lower-risk coun­tries or re­gions have to ei­ther take a PCR test – the gold stan­dard for Covid-19 tests – upon ar­rival, or serve a seven-day SHN at home and be tested at the end of that pe­riod. These coun­tries in­clude Brunei, New Zealand, Viet­nam, Aus­tralia and main­land China.</p>
    <p>Those from the higher-risk group have to serve their 14-day SHN at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties. In some in­stances, they will be al­lowed to serve this no­tice at home, but will have to meet re­quire­ments like wear­ing elec­tronic mon­i­tor­ing de­vices.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong cau­tioned that while com­mu­nity cases are cur­rently very low, “it is in­evitable” that the risk of clus­ters form­ing will rise when Sin­ga­pore en­ters phase three and more ac­tiv­i­ties re­sume.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans must be “men­tally pre­pared” for the num­ber of com­mu­nity cases to go up to dou­ble dig­its – and per­haps even to the 20s and 30s, he added.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s test­ing ca­pa­bil­ity has been stepped up to pre­vent large, out-of-con­trol clus­ters from form­ing, he said. For the same rea­son, Sin­ga­pore also needs to strengthen its con­tact trac­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties through the ex­pan­sion of SafeEn­try and TraceTo­gether.</p>
    <p>“If we all do co­op­er­ate and do our part, we can move con­fi­dently to­wards phase three,” he added.</p>
    <p>“And, even in phase three, en­sure that the re­open­ing of our borders and the re­sump­tion of ac­tiv­i­ties do not re­sult in large clus­ters form­ing again, be­cause all of us do not want to have to go through an­other cir­cuit breaker.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore could have a Covid-19 vac­cine by early next year.</p>
    <p>The first ship­ments of a vac­cine co-de­vel­oped by Sin­ga­pore re­searchers are ex­pected in the first quar­ter, said Arc­turus Ther­a­peu­tics – the Amer­i­can phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany work­ing with DukeNUS Med­i­cal School sci­en­tists on the vac­cine – yes­ter­day, as it an­nounced pos­i­tive pre­lim­i­nary re­sults from the early-stage clin­i­cal tri­als be­ing con­ducted in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board (EDB) is pump­ing in some US$45 mil­lion (S$61 mil­lion) into the man­u­fac­ture of the vac­cine, which will be used for the pur­chase of equip­ment, ma­te­ri­als and ser­vices re­lated to the vac­cine’s man­u­fac­ture, said Arc­turus.</p>
    <p>The EDB will also have the right to pur­chase up to US$175 mil­lion (S$236 mil­lion) worth of the vac­cine at pre-ne­go­ti­ated prices, with ship­ments ex­pected to be­gin in the first quar­ter of next year, the firm added in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School’s Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong, who co-de­vel­oped the vac­cine with Arc­turus, said the re­sults so far were promis­ing and showed that the vac­cine could be ef­fec­tive as a sin­gle dose.</p>
    <p>“This dif­fer­en­ti­ates this in­ves­ti­ga­tional vac­cine from many other Covid-19 vac­cines in de­vel­op­ment,” said Prof Ooi, who is also a mem­ber of Arc­turus’ Vac­cine Plat­form Sci­en­tific Ad­vi­sory Board.</p>
    <p>“The vac­cine has the po­ten­tial to pro­vide im­por­tant pub­lic health ben­e­fits by greatly fa­cil­i­tat­ing broad ad­min­is­tra­tion across mul­ti­ple pop­u­la­tions world­wide.”</p>
    <p>Some 106 vol­un­teers were en­rolled in the early-stage tri­als in Sin­ga­pore, of whom 28 re­ceived place­bos. The rest re­ceived ei­ther one or two doses.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing early-stage tri­als, mainly car­ried out among smaller groups of up to hun­dreds of vol­un­teers, re­searchers look out for dan­ger­ous side ef­fects and an­a­lyse pa­tient sam­ples to see how the hu­man im­mune sys­tem re­sponds to the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>They also seek to de­ter­mine how many doses are needed to in­cite the de­sired im­mune re­sponse.</p>
    <p>Pre­lim­i­nary find­ings for the vac­cine, dubbed Lu­nar-Cov19, in­di­cate pos­i­tive re­sponses in both safety and im­mune re­sponse.</p>
    <p>Arc­turus said no sub­jects have with­drawn from the study and there have been no se­ri­ous ad­verse events deemed to be treat­ment-re­lated.</p>
    <p>As for the im­mune re­sponse, both an­ti­body and T-cell re­sponse has been ob­served in vol­un­teers.</p>
    <p>Arc­turus said it is in dis­cus­sions with the Health Sciences Au­thor­ity to ad­vance into later-stage clin­i­cal stud­ies.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times had ear­lier re­ported that phase three clin­i­cal tri­als could start be­fore the end of this year.</p>
    <p>Such tri­als are much larger in</p>
    <p>scope than ear­lier ones, usu­ally in­volv­ing thou­sands to tens of thou­sands of peo­ple. These are of­ten held across mul­ti­ple ju­ris­dic­tions or coun­tries, and aim to see if the vac­cine can con­fer pro­tec­tion from in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The en­cour­ag­ing pre­lim­i­nary find­ings for the Sin­ga­pore co-de­vel­oped vac­cine come as the vac­cine de­vel­op­ment race heats up.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Pfizer and BioN­Tech an­nounced that their ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cine is 90 per cent ef­fec­tive at pre­vent­ing Covid-19 in on­go­ing phase three tri­als. They are await­ing data on safety, which could come later this month.</p>
