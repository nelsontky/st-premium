    <p>An ex­pert com­mit­tee has been ap­pointed to ad­vise the Gov­ern­ment on its Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion strat­egy. The Health Min­istry an­nounced yes­ter­day that the 14-mem­ber panel, which in­cludes ex­perts in im­munol­ogy and other fields, is chaired by se­nior ad­viser to the direc­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices Ben­jamin Ong.</p>
    <p>A 14-mem­ber com­mit­tee has been ap­pointed by the Min­istry of Health (MOH) to make rec­om­men­da­tions to the Gov­ern­ment on its Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion strat­egy, and en­sure the safe and ef­fec­tive use of vac­cines against the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, MOH said in a news state­ment that the com­mit­tee is chaired by As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ben­jamin Ong, se­nior ad­viser to the direc­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices. He is also se­nior vice-pres­i­dent of health ed­u­ca­tion and re­sources at the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The com­mit­tee com­prises ex­perts in in­fec­tious dis­eases, im­munol­ogy and other rel­e­vant fields. Its mem­bers in­clude Pro­fes­sor Tan Chorh Chuan, chief health sci­en­tist and ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of MOH’s Of­fice for Health­care Trans­for­ma­tion; Dr Danny Soon, chief ex­ec­u­tive at the Con­sor­tium for Clin­i­cal Re­search and In­no­va­tion Sin­ga­pore; and Dr Lisa Ooi, vi­cepres­i­dent of health­care and well­ness at the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board.</p>
    <p>MOH said: “The ex­pert com­mit­tee will lever­age sci­en­tific and clin­i­cal ex­per­tise to as­sess vac­cine can­di­dates, and rec­om­mend the ap­pro­pri­ate vac­cines for use against Covid-19 in Sin­ga­pore when they be­come avail­able.”</p>
    <p>The min­istry added that the com­mit­tee’s role is to con­sider the most up-to-date in­for­ma­tion and as­sess­ment of Covid-19 vac­cines, in­clud­ing closely mon­i­tor­ing the global vac­cine de­vel­op­ment land­scape and stance of agen­cies such as the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>As the lat­est clin­i­cal data of vac­cine can­di­dates emerges, the ex­pert com­mit­tee will as­sess their safety, ef­fi­cacy and suit­abil­ity for use by the dif­fer­ent seg­ments of Sin­ga­pore’s pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>It will then make rec­om­men­da­tions re­gard­ing the ad­min­is­tra­tion of vac­cines to spe­cific seg­ments of the pop­u­la­tion and the over­all vac­ci­na­tion strat­egy for Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The com­mit­tee was an­nounced on Tues­day. MOH said yes­ter­day that its ap­point­ment came into ef­fect on Oct 5.</p>
    <p>It con­vened its first meet­ing on Oct 13 and has met reg­u­larly in the past month to dis­cuss the pro­files of var­i­ous vac­cine can­di­dates, as well as the con­di­tions for their de­ploy­ment in Sin­ga­pore’s con­text.</p>
    <p>Prof Ong said yes­ter­day that as more vac­cine can­di­dates are made avail­able, en­sur­ing they are safe and ef­fec­tive will be a top pri­or­ity for the com­mit­tee – es­pe­cially since not all vac­cines are suit­able for all seg­ments of the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>He added: “The safety of Sin­ga­pore­ans is our top pri­or­ity, and the di­verse range of ex­per­tise among my col­leagues in the ex­pert com­mit­tee will put us in good stead as we de­lib­er­ate on strate­gies for the im­ple­men­ta­tion of Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>DI­VERSE RANGE OF EX­PERTS</p>
    <p>The safety of Sin­ga­pore­ans is our top pri­or­ity, and the di­verse range of ex­per­tise among my col­leagues in the ex­pert com­mit­tee will put us in good stead as we de­lib­er­ate on strate­gies for the im­ple­men­ta­tion of Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>AS­SO­CIATE PRO­FES­SOR BEN­JAMIN ONG, se­nior ad­viser to the direc­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices. He is also se­nior vice-pres­i­dent of health ed­u­ca­tion and re­sources at the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s cam­paign has taken an­other step in its long-shot le­gal strat­egy to over­turn his elec­tion de­feat with a Michi­gan law­suit, while Geor­gia an­nounced a re­count and Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den worked on lay­ing the foun­da­tion of his ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den will name long-time aide Ron Klain as his White House chief of staff, ac­cord­ing to the New York Times.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s team went to the fed­eral court on Wed­nes­day to try to block Michi­gan, a Mid­west­ern bat­tle­ground state that he won in 2016 but lost to Mr Bi­den, from cer­ti­fy­ing the Nov 3 elec­tion re­sults.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump trailed in the state by roughly 148,000 votes, or 2.6 per­cent­age points, ac­cord­ing to Edi­son Re­search, with nearly 100 per cent of the vote counted. The law­suit made al­le­ga­tions of vot­ing mis­con­duct, with the fo­cus on the Demo­cratic strong­hold of Wayne County, which in­cludes Detroit.</p>
    <p>Mr Jake Rol­low, a spokesman for the Michi­gan Depart­ment of State, said the Trump cam­paign was pro­mot­ing false claims to erode public con­fi­dence in the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“It does not change the truth: Michi­gan’s elec­tions were con­ducted fairly, se­curely, trans­par­ently, and the re­sults are an ac­cu­rate re­flec­tion of the will of the peo­ple,” Mr Rol­low said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den last Satur­day clinched vic­tory as he won a se­ries of bat­tle­ground states to ex­ceed the 270 elec­toral votes needed in the state-by-state Elec­toral Col­lege that de­ter­mines who wins the pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>He also was win­ning the na­tional pop­u­lar vote by more than 5 mil­lion votes, with a few states still count­ing bal­lots.</p>
    <p>Judges have tossed out sev­eral of the Trump law­suits, and le­gal ex­perts say the lit­i­ga­tion has scant chance of chang­ing the out­come.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den widened his lead on Wed­nes­day in key states as vote­count­ing con­tin­ued, in­clud­ing Penn­syl­va­nia where he now holds a 50,000-vote lead.</p>
