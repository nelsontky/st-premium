    <p>I am dis­ap­pointed to hear Mr Chong Kee Hiong, MP for Bis­han-Toa Payoh GRC, say in Par­lia­ment that Sin­ga­pore work­ers should be al­lowed to take up two jobs for “job se­cu­rity”. It plainly shows a lack of em­pa­thy for work­ers.</p>
    <p>Given a choice, most peo­ple would choose to work in one job. I know of many low-in­come work­ers who hold two or three jobs be­cause of their poor fi­nan­cial sit­u­a­tion. They need to do it to sup­port their fam­i­lies be­cause what they earn from one job is not suf­fi­cient to cover their ex­penses.</p>
    <p>In­stead of sug­gest­ing that peo­ple take up a se­cond job, a bet­ter so­lu­tion would be to re­duce the cost of liv­ing and tar­get more so­cial as­sis­tance for low-in­come work­ers.</p>
    <p>Many coun­tries are ad­vo­cat­ing work-life bal­ance, and it goes against work­ers’ wel­fare to take up two jobs in or­der to suf­fi­ciently feed one’s fam­ily in present day Sin­ga­pore. This is not the direc­tion a self-pro­fessed car­ing so­ci­ety should be tak­ing.</p>
    <p>A worker de­prived of suf­fi­cient rest will not be able to func­tion prop­erly in his main job. Em­ploy­ers, too, do not en­cour­age their em­ploy­ees to take up two jobs as they know that it is not healthy for their em­ploy­ees, es­pe­cially if it com­pro­mises safety.</p>
