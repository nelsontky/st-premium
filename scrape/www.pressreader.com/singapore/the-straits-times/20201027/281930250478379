    </section>

    <p>On Oct 27, 1980, the gov­ern­ments of Peru and Sin­ga­pore ex­changed for­mal notes to estab­lish of­fi­cially bi­lat­eral diplo­matic re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>The notes were signed by the Peruvian Am­bas­sador Juan Calle and the Sin­ga­porean Am­bas­sador Tommy Koh, who were at that time rep­re­sen­ta­tives of their coun­tries to the United Na­tions.</p>
    <p>The world has changed sig­nif­i­cantly in the past 40 years, but it is highly prob­a­ble that in 1980, no­body could have imag­ined the rel­e­vance achieved cur­rently by our bi­lat­eral ties.</p>
    <p>In those days, the process of glob­al­i­sa­tion was just loom­ing on the hori­zon. But even then the emer­gence of the so-called “Asian tigers”, with Sin­ga­pore among them, was draw­ing the at­ten­tion of in­ter­na­tional ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Peru was bent on re­in­forc­ing its links with Asian coun­tries lo­cated on the other side of the Pa­cific Ocean. This de­ci­sion was spurred by the cre­ation in 1989 of the Asia-Pa­cific Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion (Apec) and the pos­si­bil­ity of free and open trade and in­vest­ment in the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion, the most im­por­tant en­gine of global eco­nomic growth.</p>
    <p>The Peruvian strat­egy to join Apec as a full mem­ber in­cluded the es­tab­lish­ment of res­i­dent em­bassies in Asian coun­tries, and in 1992, Peru de­cided to open its first em­bassy in Sin­ga­pore. Apec may have acted as a spur to forge new links but the ties be­tween Peru and Asia go back much fur­ther.</p>
    <p>In the mid­dle of the 19th cen­tury, due to scarcity of man­power in the coun­try­side, Peruvian busi­ness­men trav­elled to China to hire labour­ers to work in their plan­ta­tions and mines.</p>
    <p>Be­tween 1849 and 1874, al­most 100,000 Chi­nese work­ers, mostly from Guang­dong and Fu­jian prov­inces, ar­rived in Peru. Many of them de­cided to set­tle down in the host coun­try and mixed with the lo­cal peo­ple.</p>
    <p>As a con­se­quence, 10 per cent of the cur­rent Peruvian pop­u­la­tion are de­scen­dants of those Chi­nese mi­grants and have cre­ated new cul­tural ex­pres­sions which merged Chi­nese and lo­cal in­flu­ences, such as “Chifa” food, in a way very sim­i­lar to the evo­lu­tion of Per­anakan cui­sine in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>To reg­u­late such mi­gra­tion, Peru was the first Latin Amer­i­can coun­try to estab­lish diplo­matic re­la­tions with China un­der the</p>
    <p>Qing dy­nasty in 1874 when both coun­tries signed a Treaty of Amity, Trade and Nav­i­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>At the end of the 19th cen­tury, the ar­rival of the first Ja­panese mi­grants en­riched the Asian pres­ence in Peru. Now Peru has the largest Chi­nese com­mu­nity in Latin Amer­ica and the sec­ond-largest Ja­panese com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>This ex­cep­tional his­toric ex­pe­ri­ence en­cour­aged cu­rios­ity about Asian cul­ture in Peru and has been one of the driv­ers of its ef­forts to build con­nec­tions with Asian coun­tries from the 20th cen­tury to to­day.</p>
    <p>Since the ad­mis­sion of Peru as a full mem­ber of Apec in 1998, the growth in its ties with Sin­ga­pore has ex­pe­ri­enced greater mo­men­tum as a re­sult of de­vel­op­ments in two spe­cific spheres: eco­nomic is­sues and po­lit­i­cal co­in­ci­dences in mul­ti­lat­eral fora re­gard­ing global mat­ters of mu­tual in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>In eco­nomic terms, one of the mile­stones of diplo­matic re­la­tions was the sign­ing of the bi­lat­eral Free Trade Agree­ment (FTA) in 2008 dur­ing Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong’s par­tic­i­pa­tion in the Apec Sum­mit in Lima.</p>
    <p>Since then, bi­lat­eral trade has risen at an av­er­age an­nual rate of 23 per cent. The ben­e­fits of the FTA also in­cluded in­vest­ments, as a grow­ing num­ber of com­pa­nies based in Sin­ga­pore has been in­volved in Peruvian projects in sec­tors such as en­ergy, fish­eries, agribusi­ness and mar­itime ser­vices.</p>
    <p>In 2018, both coun­tries signed an air ser­vices agree­ment aimed at en­hanc­ing con­nec­tiv­ity be­tween them, and Peru is in­ter­ested in join­ing the Dig­i­tal Econ­omy Part­ner­ship Agree­ment re­cently pro­moted by Sin­ga­pore and other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>At the mul­ti­lat­eral level, Peru and Sin­ga­pore have main­tained sim­i­lar po­si­tions on is­sues rel­e­vant to the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity, such as cli­mate change and the need to im­ple­ment the Paris Agree­ment; the up­hold­ing of in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty rights; the fight against drug traf­fick­ing; mar­itime se­cu­rity; and, lately, the im­per­a­tive of sup­port­ing the prin­ci­ple of free trade and the com­mer­cial in­ter­na­tional sys­tem based on rules.</p>
    <p>Along these lines, Peru and Sin­ga­pore par­tic­i­pate in the Al­liance for Mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism to pro­mote the rule of law and co­op­er­a­tion as a means to ef­fec­tively face the un­prece­dented chal­lenges posed by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, Peru is a mem­ber of the Global Gov­er­nance Group led by Sin­ga­pore and firmly en­dorses pri­or­i­ties pro­moted by this ini­tia­tive, such as strength­en­ing of global pre­pared­ness and re­sponse to Covid- 19 and other in­fec­tious dis­eases; re­silience in global sup­ply chains; and dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion of small and medium-sized en­ter­prises.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent ne­go­ti­a­tions for Sin­ga­pore to be­come an as­so­ciate mem­ber of the Pa­cific Al­liance (PA), com­pris­ing Chile, Colom­bia, Mex­ico and Peru, could be yet an­other build­ing block to stronger bi­lat­eral ties.</p>
    <p>The suc­cess­ful con­clu­sion of these ne­go­ti­a­tions would reaf­firm our com­mit­ment to free trade and in­crease com­merce and in­vest­ments be­tween Sin­ga­pore and this bloc of Latin Amer­i­can coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Peru could be­come a gate­way for Sin­ga­pore to en­hance its pres­ence in the re­gion, par­tic­u­larly in ar­eas of grow­ing rel­e­vance, such as agribusi­ness and aqua­cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, PA and Asean are de­vel­op­ing a joint work­ing plan to re­in­force co­op­er­a­tion on is­sues of com­mon in­ter­est, such as dig­i­tal econ­omy and ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>While Peru and Sin­ga­pore are ge­o­graph­i­cally far apart, his­tory of­fers par­al­lels and un­ex­pected con­nec­tions that will res­onate with the peo­ple of our two na­tions. Let us build upon those foun­da­tions to build more bridges to 40 more years of friend­ship and co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
