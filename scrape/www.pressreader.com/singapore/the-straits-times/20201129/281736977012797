    <p>NEW YORK/LOS AN­GE­LES • In ex­cru­ci­at­ing pain with le­sions on her face and scalp, Ms Tracey Fine lay for 13 hours on a gur­ney in a hos­pi­tal’s emer­gency room hall­way. All around her, Covid-19 pa­tients filled the beds of the hos­pi­tal in Madi­son, Wis­con­sin.</p>
    <p>Her nurse was so har­ried that she could not re­mem­ber Ms Fine’s con­di­tion, and the staff was slow to bring her pain medicine or food.</p>
    <p>In a ru­ral hos­pi­tal in Mis­souri, Mr Shain Zun­del’s se­vere headache turned out to be a brain ab­scess. His con­di­tion would typ­i­cally re­quire an op­er­a­tion within a few hours, but he was forced to wait a day while doc­tors strug­gled to find a neu­ro­sur­geon and a bed – fi­nally, at a hos­pi­tal 600km away in Iowa.</p>
    <p>From New Mexico to Min­nesota to Florida, hos­pi­tals across the US are teem­ing with record num­bers of Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Staff mem­bers at smaller hos­pi­tals have had to beg larger med­i­cal cen­tres re­peat­edly to take one more, just one more pa­tient, but many of the big­ger hos­pi­tals have sharply limited the trans­fers they will ac­cept, their own halls and wards over­flow­ing.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, the pan­demic was con­cen­trated mainly in hard­hit re­gions like New York, which of­fered lessons to hos­pi­tals in other states an­tic­i­pat­ing the spread of the virus. But de­spite months of plan­ning, many hos­pi­tals in the United States are now hit with a stag­ger­ing swell of pa­tients, no avail­able beds and wi­den­ing shortages of nurses and doc­tors. Some hos­pi­tals have had to turn away trans­fer re­quests for pa­tients.</p>
    <p>And ris­ing in­fec­tion rates among nurses and other front-line work­ers have dou­bled the pa­tient load on those left stand­ing.</p>
    <p>There is no end in sight for the na­tion’s hos­pi­tals as the pan­demic con­tin­ues to ham­mer cities and ru­ral ar­eas, with cases to­talling 13 mil­lion so far this year. Public health ex­perts warn that the hol­i­days may speed the al­ready fast-mov­ing pace of in­fec­tion, driv­ing the de­mand for hos­pi­tal beds and med­i­cal care ever higher.</p>
    <p>Some 90,000 Amer­i­cans are now hos­pi­talised with Covid-19, and new cases have been climb­ing to nearly 200,000 daily.</p>
    <p>Na­tion­wide, state and lo­cal au­thor­i­ties have in­sti­tuted or re-im­posed a wide range of Covid-19 lim­i­ta­tions in hopes of blunt­ing the wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions. For ex­am­ple, come to­mor­row, Los An­ge­les will ban all so­cial gatherings of in­di­vid­u­als from more than a sin­gle house­hold for at least</p>
    <p>three weeks, ac­cord­ing to lo­cal health of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>And even if hos­pi­tals in some cities ap­pear to have enough phys­i­cal space staff shortages still pose chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>“Beds don’t take care of peo­ple; peo­ple take care of peo­ple,” said Dr Marc Har­ri­son, chief ex­ec­u­tive of In­ter­moun­tain Health­care.</p>
