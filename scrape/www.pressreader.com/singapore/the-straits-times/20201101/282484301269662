    <p>AN­GUS CHOW, 38</p>
    <p>SAKE LABO www.en­vy­hos­pi­tal­ity.co/sake­labo</p>
    <p>To say that chef An­gus Chow has paid his dues would be an un­der­state­ment.</p>
    <p>His first restau­rant job was a part-time one, at age 15, in a ho­tel restau­rant, where he says he was “run­ning around like a head­less chicken”.</p>
    <p>Then came work in a string of Ja­panese restau­rants, and de­tours into other cuisines at, among other places, French restau­rant Les Amis, and Span­ish restau­rants Food­bar Dada and FOC.</p>
    <p>You would think some­one like him would be jaded by the restau­rant scene, a lit­tle cyn­i­cal. He is savvy and knows how to please his din­ers. But there is also a will­ing­ness to try new things, to push the bound­aries of his cook­ing.</p>
    <p>At the end of this month, he opens Sake Labo in Stan­ley Street. It has a re­tail shop sell­ing sake and ac­cou­trements such as sake cups and carafes and a restau­rant, and he will pre­side over a four-seat omakase counter, where din­ner will fea­ture at least six cour­ses and cost $188 a per­son.</p>
    <p>At age 38, the fa­ther of two has found a backer will­ing to trust his in­stincts and to give him a stake in the busi­ness.</p>
    <p>This was not al­ways the case, al­though he de­clines to give the gory de­tails. But one gets the feel­ing that he has been bit­ten hard in other ven­tures.</p>
    <p>At Sake Labo, he aims to show­case sake from small brew­eries, un­usual la­bels that are not easy to find in Sin­ga­pore. The restau­rant will serve what he calls Ja­pas – Ja­panese and Span­ish in­spired tapas de­signed to go well with sake. Th­ese will cost $8 and up.</p>
    <p>Din­ers at the omakase counter will be served sashimi, grilled fish, a fried item such as an uni pil­low or eel tem­pura, among other cour­ses.</p>
    <p>“I want to build a sake cul­ture in Sin­ga­pore. Sake is not re­stricted to Das­sai,” he says, re­fer­ring to a pop­u­lar brand.</p>
    <p>He is spar­ing no ex­pense to out­fit the place, with $10,000 worth of crock­ery from</p>
    <p>Ja­pan and Turkey.</p>
    <p>Since he has been in the busi­ness longer than the other chefs, what are the three most im­por­tant lessons he has learnt? He mulls over this for a while. “Open your­self up to new tech­nol­ogy and try new in­gre­di­ents,” he says.</p>
    <p>“You must al­ways lis­ten. Chefs think they are al­ways right. Be hum­ble. If you are nice to peo­ple, they’ll be nice to you.”</p>
    <p>Hav­ing worked in so many places, he also knows why restau­rants fail. “It’s bad man­age­ment, where there is no trust be­tween the in­vestors and the chefs and oper­a­tors.”</p>
    <p>All of this speaks of the grow­ing up he has had to do in the busi­ness. He says: “I started with a low EQ. I thought that if the food was good, I didn’t have to care who the din­ers were. I was anti-so­cial.”</p>
    <p>So what changed?</p>
    <p>“Seven or eight years ago, I de­cided I wanted to have my own restau­rant,” he says. “There is more to this busi­ness than cook­ing. You have to know peo­ple.”</p>
