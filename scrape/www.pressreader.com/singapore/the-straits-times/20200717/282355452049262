    <p>LON­DON • Manch­ester United man­ager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has claimed that it is un­fair Chelsea have an ex­tra two days of rest be­fore their FA Cup semi-fi­nal show­down on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The Red Devils trav­elled to Lon­don yes­ter­day to take on Crys­tal Palace in the Pre­mier League, be­fore the Wem­b­ley en­counter with the Blues. They had also played on Mon­day in a 2-2 home draw with Southamp­ton.</p>
    <p>But un­like United’s hec­tic sched­ule, Chelsea have been rest­ing since Tues­day’s 1-0 win over Nor­wich at Stam­ford Bridge.</p>
    <p>With Solskjaer’s men chas­ing a top-four po­si­tion and Cham­pi­ons League foot­ball, there has been lit­tle op­por­tu­nity for him to ro­tate play­ers.</p>
    <p>The Nor­we­gian is con­cerned that United’s bid to reach the FA Cup fi­nal is be­ing jeop­ar­dised by the fix­ture con­ges­tion.</p>
    <p>“There is a con­cern, ob­vi­ously. They’ve (Chelsea) had 48 hours’ more rest and recovery than us. It’s not fair,” he told re­porters on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“We spoke about a fair sched­ul­ing go­ing into this restart. Of course, it isn’t... let’s pick up the pieces af­ter that (Palace).”</p>
    <p>How­ever, he feels United have the en­ergy and drive to cope with the tax­ing pro­gramme de­spite fit­ness con­cerns over Ma­son Greenwood, Luke Shaw and Bran­don Wil­liams.</p>
    <p>“We’ve not re­ally played ev­ery three days – we will now, def­i­nitely,” Solskjaer said.</p>
    <p>“The next two weeks will be hec­tic but, then again, we’re fit. Very fit. Our lads have not felt as fit as this for years, I’m sure.</p>
    <p>“It was a big thing to­wards the end of last sea­son that we felt our team wasn’t fit enough, we got a few in­juries.</p>
    <p>“This sea­son, we’ve not had that kind of a prob­lem.</p>
    <p>“No, it’s not go­ing to be a prob­lem and a con­cern for us, but 24 hours, 48 hours is a big dif­fer­ence at this time of the sea­son as well.</p>
    <p>“So we’ve not been handed four aces, to put it that way, for the last two weeks. But we’re go­ing to have to put on a poker face and play the cards well.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, one player that Solskjaer has no con­cerns about is mid­fielder Paul Pogba.</p>
    <p>The 2018 World Cup win­ner has fea­tured in all seven of United’s games since the restart, af­ter barely play­ing pre­vi­ously ow­ing to a se­ri­ous knee in­jury for which he needed surgery.</p>
    <p>The French­man is likely to be one of the first names on the team sheet against Frank Lam­pard’s men on Sun­day. “I’ve been speak­ing more or less ev­ery day with Paul,” Solskjaer added.</p>
    <p>“He knows he wouldn’t be dropped.</p>
    <p>“When Paul plays like this, he won’t be dropped from any team in the world – France or United.</p>
    <p>“He’s been fan­tas­tic since the restart and brought a lot to the team.</p>
    <p>“He’s been out for a long, long time, there was a question mark be­fore the game (against Southamp­ton). But he felt ready for it.”</p>
    <p>The FA Cup re­mains Chelsea’s last op­por­tu­nity for sil­ver­ware this sea­son.</p>
    <p>United, mean­while, still have the Europa League – they have a 5-0 ad­van­tage go­ing into the home sec­ond leg of their last-16 tie with Aus­tria’s Lask – to look for­ward to next month.</p>
    <p>UN­DAUNTED</p>
    <p>So we’ve not been handed four aces, to put it that way, for the last two weeks. But we’re go­ing to have to put on a poker face and play the cards well.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
