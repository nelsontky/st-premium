    <p>Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyid­din Yassin has been given the thumbs up by nearly seven in 10 Malaysians, thanks largely to his gov­ern­ment’s han­dling of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, but his pop­u­lar­ity has slipped below 70 per cent for the first time since he took power in March.</p>
    <p>Top poll­ster Merdeka Cen­tre said yes­ter­day a sur­vey found that 69 per cent of 3,415 vot­ers polled from July 15 to Aug 10 ap­proved of his lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>The last time a premier scored higher was within the first 100 days of the Ma­hathir Mo­hamad ad­min­is­tra­tion amid the eu­pho­ria of Pakatan Hara­pan’s (PH) shock vic­tory in the May 2018 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Some 93 per cent also said they were sat­is­fied with the gov­ern­ment’s per­for­mance in man­ag­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, 68 per cent for help­ing the needy and 61 per cent for run­ning the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Un­sur­pris­ingly, Tan Sri Muhyid­din scored much higher among bu­mi­put­era – a term used to col­lec­tively re­fer to the Malay ma­jor­ity and other indige­nous tribes – with more than nine in 10 sup­port­ing him, com­pared with other com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Only a third of Chi­nese ap­proved of Mr Muhyid­din, who leads a gov­ern­ment dom­i­nated by bu­mi­put­era par­ties, in­clud­ing the three main Malay-Mus­lim out­fits – Umno, Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia (PAS) and his Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia.</p>
    <p>“In our view, this in­crease of Malay voter sup­port takes place on the back of a pos­i­tive man­age­ment of the Covid-19 pan­demic, rapid re­sponse i n dis­pens­ing fi­nan­cial aid to af­fected l ow­in­come house­holds and busi­nesses, as well as the la­tent sat­is­fac­tion at see­ing Malay po­lit­i­cal par­ties which had been in decades-long com­pe­ti­tion with one an­other fi­nally com­ing together in a pact,” Merdeka Cen­tre chief Ibrahim Suf­fian said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Merdeka Cen­tre said the sur­vey also found that Mr Muhyid­din’s pop­u­lar­ity has slipped below 70 per cent – from as high as 74 per cent – for the first time since he took power on March 1.</p>
    <p>The dip jus­ti­fies the push by lead­ers of the rul­ing par­ties for early polls, as they seek to cap­i­talise on pos­i­tive sen­ti­ment over the gov­ern­ment’s han­dling of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But amid the jostling between Ber­satu and Umno – which ruled Malaysia for six decades un­til 2018 – for lever­age within the rul­ing pact ahead of fresh elec­tions ex­pected within months, there is wide­spread sup­port among Malays for these par­ties to unite.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey showed that some 65 and 68 per cent re­spec­tively want Umno and PAS to be part of Mr Muhyid­din’s Perikatan Na­sional (PN) coali­tion, while six in 10 say Ber­satu should also be part of Muafakat Na­sional (MN), the Malay-Mus­lim in­ter­est plat­form set up by Umno and PAS last year.</p>
    <p>The only coali­tion that the ma­jor­ity of Malaysians are sat­is­fied with is PN, with 51 per cent say­ing they are happy with the pact.</p>
    <p>Hap­pi­ness and dis­sat­is­fac­tion lev­els for Umno-led Barisan Na­sional (BN) are both at 40 per cent and sim­i­larly for MN at 37 per cent. Only a quar­ter of Malaysians are happy with PH, now the main op­po­si­tion coali­tion.</p>
    <p>Three-quar­ters of Malays are also happy with PN, ver­sus 70 per cent for MN and 57 per cent for BN.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, for­mer premier Na­jib Razak fared poorly, with more peo­ple across all de­mo­graph­ics agree­ing with his graft con­vic­tion in July than dis­agree­ing.</p>
    <p>Even among the Malays, 57 per cent be­lieve the High Court made the right de­ci­sion.</p>
