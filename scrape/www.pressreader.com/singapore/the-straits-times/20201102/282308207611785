    <p>Dr Hindumathi Palanisamy has en­joyed study­ing the skies and the stars since she was a child, a pas­sion she turned into a ca­reer as a sci­en­tist study­ing the ocean through satel­lites.</p>
    <p>“Grow­ing up in In­dia, my mother and I would of­ten go starspot­ting,” Dr Hindumathi, 33, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“That got me in­ter­ested in the so­lar sys­tem, the ori­gins of the uni­verse, and I also loved the earth sciences, be­cause it was so in­ter­est­ing to know more about the planet we are liv­ing on.”</p>
    <p>Dr Hindumathi, now a se­nior re­search sci­en­tist in the na­tional sea-level pro­gramme un­der the Cen­tre for Cli­mate Re­search Sin­ga­pore (CCRS), is lev­er­ag­ing her ex­per­tise in oceanog­ra­phy and space tech­nol­ogy to study how ris­ing sea lev­els could im­pact Sin­ga­pore and the re­gion.</p>
    <p>The oceans cover more than 70 per cent of the earth’s sur­face, yet their sheer size and in­ac­ces­si­bil­ity of some ar­eas mean it is dif­fi­cult to scru­ti­nise how sea lev­els vary across the globe.</p>
    <p>“Tide gauges are use­ful to di­rectly mea­sure how sea lev­els vary, but th­ese are very sparsely dis­trib­uted along the coast­lines and there­fore can­not cap­ture ev­ery part of the ocean,” she said.</p>
    <p>But satel­lites of­fer broader cov­er­age, func­tion­ing as eyes in the sky for sci­en­tists study­ing how sea lev­els are ris­ing in re­sponse to melt­ing ice sheets and ther­mal ex­pan­sion of wa­ter.</p>
    <p>This is done through a tech­nique known as satel­lite al­time­try, a rel­a­tively new field of science that gained trac­tion only in the 1990s, said Dr Hindumathi, who spent 11 years in France study­ing and work­ing on sea-level science be­fore mov­ing to Sin­ga­pore, with her hus­band and two chil­dren, last year to join CCRS.</p>
    <p>Satel­lite radar al­time­ters mea­sure sea lev­els by de­ter­min­ing the time it takes a radar pulse to make a round trip from the satel­lite to the sea sur­face and back, noted the United States’ Na­tional Oceanic and At­mo­spheric Ad­min­is­tra­tion on its web­site.</p>
    <p>But this is not the only strat­egy in a cli­mate sci­en­tist’s tool­kit.</p>
    <p>Sea-level rise is also stud­ied through data col­lected through tide gauges and high-tech buoys, known as Argo floats, that can mea­sure the tem­per­a­ture and salin­ity pro­file in a wa­ter col­umn. Other tools, such as the use of ocean mod­els, can also con­trib­ute to a more com­plete un­der­stand­ing of sealevel rise and coastal im­pacts.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple of­ten as­sume that with global warm­ing, sea lev­els would rise the same way around the world, but that’s not the case,” said Dr Hindumathi.</p>
    <p>Pre­lim­i­nary stud­ies at CCRS show that ris­ing sea lev­els in trop­i­cal ar­eas could be up to 30 per cent higher than the global av­er­age due to var­i­ous fac­tors.</p>
    <p>The Equa­tor is lo­cated away from the two ice sheets, in Green­land and Antarc­tica. When the ice sheets lose mass due to higher tem­per­a­tures – the grav­i­ta­tional pull that once held wa­ters around the ice close to them re­laxes. This causes wa­ter to “slosh” away from the ice sheets – and likely, towards the Equa­tor.</p>
    <p>“Many peo­ple may think that cli­mate change doesn’t con­cern them, be­cause the ice sheets are so far away. But it’s some­thing that we need to think about. We, cli­mate sci­en­tists, should make it a pri­or­ity to con­vey to peo­ple the im­por­tance of cli­mate change.”</p>
