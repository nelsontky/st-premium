    <p>I agree fully with the two youth con­trib­u­tors to the Fo­rum – Yew Jien Lynn (Schools’ role in youth men­tal health) and Chan Sze Yin (Sup­port those with men­tal health is­sues, both on Oct 5) and thank them for rais­ing the is­sue.</p>
    <p>The men­tal well-be­ing of stu­dents is im­por­tant and we will do our best to sup­port them. Also, it is cru­cial that those who suf­fer from men­tal health is­sues do not feel that they are stig­ma­tised.</p>
    <p>As fam­i­lies face ad­di­tional pres­sures, fi­nan­cial or oth­er­wise, in the wake of Covid-19, youth men­tal well-be­ing can suf­fer too.</p>
    <p>It is im­por­tant that we iden­tify trig­gers and is­sues early to be able to sup­port them ap­pro­pri­ately.</p>
    <p>Our schools aim to pro­vide a sup­port­ive en­vi­ron­ment, so that stu­dents feel safe in seek­ing help. They work closely with com­mu­nity part­ners and so­cial ser­vice agen­cies to sup­port stu­dents and their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>Our teach­ers know that apart from teach­ing, they also pro­vide a lis­ten­ing ear to their stu­dents. They have reg­u­lar con­ver­sa­tions with their stu­dents and look out for dis­tress signs. If needed, school coun­sel­lors of­fer ad­di­tional sup­port.</p>
    <p>Un­der­stand­ably, some stu­dents may still pre­fer to share their feel­ings with their friends. We are thus strength­en­ing peer sup­port in all schools, so that peers can alert an adult for timely help if their friends are dis­tressed.</p>
    <p>As part of men­tal health education in the re­vised char­ac­ter and cit­i­zen­ship education cur­ricu­lum, stu­dents learn how to cope with emo­tional sit­u­a­tions, seek help, and be a source of care and com­fort to oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, we set up the Youth Men­tal Well-be­ing Net­work to part­ner the com­mu­nity on this is­sue. Over 1,000 in­di­vid­u­als, com­pris­ing youth, par­ents, care­givers, men­tal health and so­cial sec­tor pro­fes­sion­als, re­sponded. We are ex­tremely heart­ened by this as the whole of so­ci­ety needs to come to­gether to ef­fec­tively sup­port our youth and their men­tal well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>We wel­come ev­ery­one who is con­cerned about this is­sue to join us, con­trib­ute ideas and be a part of change. This is a long jour­ney but we are only stronger to­gether.</p>
