    <p>In an­other push to re­open its bor­der, re­sume gen­eral travel on a lim­ited ba­sis and re­vive its dec­i­mated air hub, Sin­ga­pore is plan­ning to start talks on air travel bub­bles with coun­tries that have man­aged the Covid-19 pan­demic well.</p>
    <p>In an­other push to re­open its bor­ders, re­sume gen­eral travel on a lim­ited ba­sis and re­vive its dec­i­mated air hub, Sin­ga­pore is plan­ning to start talks on air travel bub­bles with coun­tries that have man­aged the Covid-19 pan­demic well.</p>
    <p>Tourists and other trav­ellers who come in un­der this pro­posed ar­range­ment will be tested for the coro­n­avirus, but would not have to be quar­an­tined or fol­low a fixed itin­er­ary, said Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He noted in his min­is­te­rial state­ment that test­ing is the key to un­lock­ing air travel, and to that end, a ded­i­cated Covid-19 test­ing lab­o­ra­tory will be set up at Changi Air­port in the next few months.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Ong: “The longer our bor­ders re­main closed, the greater the risk of los­ing our sta­tus as an air hub, and our at­trac­tive­ness as a place to in­vest... The sta­tus quo is there­fore not sus­tain­able for us.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s sta­tus as an air hub has played a key role in at­tract­ing com­pa­nies to in­vest heav­ily here, he noted. This is be­cause com­pa­nies know their var­i­ous stake­hold­ers can travel in and out of Sin­ga­pore eas­ily.</p>
    <p>But con­nec­tiv­ity has been se­verely ham­pered. For ex­am­ple, Changi now has di­rect flights to just 49 cities world­wide, down from 160 be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We need to take proac­tive steps to re­vive the Changi air hub, as a top na­tional pri­or­ity,” said Mr Ong.</p>
    <p>“Our avi­a­tion hub sta­tus is es­sen­tial, even ex­is­ten­tial, to the health of the Sin­ga­pore econ­omy, to our jobs and our fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>The Changi air hub and its ad­ja­cent industries con­trib­uted to more than 5 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct and em­ployed more than 190,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>But the sit­u­a­tion has be­come dire since Covid-19 struck. Changi Air­port, which was the sev­enth busiest air­port in the world in terms of in­ter­na­tional pas­sen­ger traf­fic be­fore the pan­demic, has fallen to 58th place.</p>
    <p>It is serv­ing just 1.5 per cent of its usual pas­sen­ger vol­ume and 6 per cent of the usual num­ber of pas­sen­ger flights at the moment.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral avi­a­tion com­pa­nies – most no­tably Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) – have re­trenched staff amid ex­pec­ta­tions of a long-drawn-out re­cov­ery for the air travel sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong pledged that while the</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment will con­tinue to sup­port SIA, Changi Air­port Group and the avi­a­tion sec­tor as much as it can, the best way to help them would be to re­store pas­sen­ger traf­fic in a con­trolled and safe man­ner.</p>
    <p>Test­ing in­com­ing trav­ellers will be key to this move.</p>
    <p>More Covid-19 tests will be al­lo­cated to air trav­ellers, with Sin­ga­pore on track to raise its test­ing ca­pac­ity from 27,000 peo­ple a day cur­rently to 40,000. It is also look­ing at faster and less in­tru­sive tests.</p>
    <p>Test­ing trav­ellers must be com­ple­mented by the abil­ity to trace con­tacts of in­fected cases and hav­ing a lo­cal sit­u­a­tion un­der con­trol, he said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s re­sults in con­trol­ling the pan­demic – re­flected in its low fa­tal­ity rate and low com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion – mat­ter greatly to coun­tries and re­gions seek­ing part­ners to re­store avi­a­tion links, said Mr Ong. “The key is to make sure we stay safe and man­age the risks while we open up avi­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Point­ing to how Sin­ga­pore is es­tab­lish­ing more re­cip­ro­cal green lanes, fa­cil­i­tat­ing trans­fers at Changi and uni­lat­er­ally open­ing its bor­ders to coun­tries where the pan­demic is un­der con­trol, he said: “We can­not con­trol what other coun­tries want to do with their bor­ders. But we can con­trol ours, to wel­come back vis­i­tors, bring back jobs, and re­vive our air hub safely.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ong added: “The mes­sage we want to send to the world is this – Sin­ga­pore has started to re­open its bor­ders. In the near fu­ture, if you have the virus un­der con­trol and in­fec­tion rates are as low as Sin­ga­pore’s, you are wel­come to visit us, but trav­ellers will be sub­ject to a Covid-19 test, as a pre­cau­tion.”</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment will sit again next Wed­nes­day.</p>
