    <p>An­other board mem­ber of City De­vel­op­ments Lim­ited (CDL) has re­signed, cit­ing con­cerns over the com­pany’s in­vest­ment in Sin­cere Prop­erty Group.</p>
    <p>In a late-night fil­ing on Tues­day, CDL announced that Mr Koh Thiam Hock, 70, had stepped down as an in­de­pen­dent non-ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor, with im­me­di­ate ef­fect from Mon­day, after more than four years on the prop­erty gi­ant’s board.</p>
    <p>CDL said Mr Koh be­lieved it was “most ap­pro­pri­ate for him to now step down as a di­rec­tor” after hav­ing “shared his ob­ser­va­tions, con­cerns and sug­ges­tions on the group’s in­vest­ment in Sin­cere”.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh’s res­ig­na­tion comes not</p>
    <p>long after for­mer non-ex­ec­u­tive and non-in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tor Kwek Leng Peck quit abruptly in Oc­to­ber after more than 30 years in the role.</p>
    <p>Mr Kwek is the cousin of Mr Kwek Leng Beng – the bil­lion­aire ex­ec­u­tive chair­man of CDL who also helms the Hong Leong group of com­pa­nies – and the un­cle of CDL group chief ex­ec­u­tive Sher­man Kwek Eik Tse, son of Mr Kwek Leng Beng.</p>
    <p>At the time, Mr Kwek Leng Peck cited dis­agree­ments with the board over CDL’s in­vest­ment in Sin­cere, as well as its con­tin­u­ing pro­vi­sion of fi­nan­cial sup­port to the Chi­nese prop­erty group. He also had reser­va­tions over the com</p>
    <p>pany’s ap­proach in manag­ing its Lon­don-based wholly owned unit, Mil­len­nium & Copthorne Ho­tels, which he con­cur­rently re­signed from as a di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>With Mr Koh’s exit, CDL has ap­pointed Ms Carol Fong, group chief ex­ec­u­tive of CGS-CIMB Se­cu­ri­ties, as its new in­de­pen­dent nonex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor with im­me­di­ate ef­fect. She was also ap­pointed a mem­ber of the re­mu­ner­a­tion com­mit­tee on the com­pany’s board.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate fil­ing with the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change on Tues­day night, CDL said it looked for­ward to Ms Fong’s “con­tri­bu­tion of skills and di­ver­sity” to its board’s cur­rent core com­pe­ten­cies.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tion­ally, it announced a change in com­po­si­tion of its board and cer­tain board com­mit­tees fol­low­ing Mr Koh’s res­ig­na­tion and Ms Fong’s ap­point­ment.</p>
    <p>With ef­fect from Tues­day, Mr Chong Yoon Chou and Mr Colin Ong Lian Jin were ap­pointed as mem­bers of CDL’s au­dit and risk, and re­mu­ner­a­tion com­mit­tees, re­spec­tively, while Mr Philip Yeo stepped down as a mem­ber of the re­mu­ner­a­tion com­mit­tee. At the same time, Mr Sher­man Kwek was ap­pointed mem­ber of the board com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>CDL’s re­cent lead­er­ship changes come after the group’s de­ci­sion to ac­quire a 51.01 per cent stake in China-based real es­tate de­vel­oper Sin­cere for 4.39 bil­lion yuan (S$891 mil­lion) in April. The group has since ap­pointed Deloitte & Touche Fi­nan­cial Ad­vi­sory Ser­vices to con­duct a re­view of its in­vest­ment in Sin­cere. It says Deloitte has “as­cer­tained that there are good as­sets that the group can ex­tract fur­ther value (from)”.</p>
