    <p>WASH­ING­TON The Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vac­cine will reach hos­pi­tals across the United States by to­day, a top of­fi­cial said, ready to be in­jected into the arms of mil­lions of Amer­i­cans as the world’s death toll reaches 1.6 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The im­mi­nent start of the mass vac­ci­na­tion cam­paign in the world’s hard­est-hit coun­try comes as Italy over­takes Bri­tain as the Euro­pean na­tion with the high­est coro­n­avirus death toll.</p>
    <p>“I am wor­ried about the two weeks of Christmas hol­i­days. We are up against a dra­matic pan­demic which is on­go­ing – the bat­tle still has not been won,” Italian Health Min­is­ter Roberto Speranza said as the coun­try’s 64,036 deaths sur­passed Bri­tain’s 64,026.</p>
    <p>Re­gional Af­fairs Min­is­ter Francesco Boc­cia said that un­less peo­ple adopted a care­ful ap­proach, “the risk of a third wave is almost cer­tain”.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tions in the US are still soar­ing, with 1.1 mil­lion new cases con­firmed in the past five days and a death toll near­ing 300,000.</p>
    <p>Doses of the Pfizer vac­cine started leav­ing the firm’s fac­tory in Kala­ma­zoo, Michi­gan, yes­ter­day, stored in boxes of dry ice that can stay at mi­nus 70 deg C to pre­serve the drug.</p>
    <p>Gen­eral Gus Perna, who is over­see­ing the mas­sive lo­gis­ti­cal op­er­a­tion, likened the mo­ment to the turn­ing point of World War II.</p>
    <p>“I am ab­so­lutely 100 per cent con­fi­dent that we are go­ing to dis­trib­ute safely, this pre­cious com­mod­ity, this vac­cine, needed to de­feat the en­emy Covid.”</p>
    <p>Gen Perna said hun­dreds of sites, in­clud­ing hos­pi­tals and dis­tri­bu­tion cen­tres, would re­ceive the vac­cines from to­day to Wed­nes­day, cov­er­ing the first wave of about three mil­lion of the most vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple to be vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>The US plans to in­oc­u­late 20 mil­lion peo­ple this month and an­other 25 mil­lion to 40 mil­lion next month, as well as in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>“We would have im­mu­nised 100 mil­lion peo­ple by the first quar­ter of 2021,” US Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed chief ad­viser Mon­cef Slaoui said in an in­ter­view with Fox News yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Fed­eral health au­thor­i­ties rec­om­mend that health­care work­ers and nurs­ing home res­i­dents be at the front of the line, but the fi­nal de­ci­sions are left to the states.</p>
    <p>In a met­ro­pol­i­tan area where one in 20 peo­ple has been in­fected with Covid-19, Los An­ge­les Mayor Eric Garcetti pre­sented an­other warn­ing: They are dy­ing too.</p>
    <p>“This week, ev­ery 20 min­utes some­one in LA County is dy­ing from Covid-19,” he tweeted.</p>
    <p>Los An­ge­les County, the most pop­u­lous in the US with 10 mil­lion peo­ple, said on Fri­day that the num­ber of in­fec­tions had sur­passed 500,000. They rose by 11,476 to 512,872 on Satur­day af­ter ris­ing by a record the day be­fore.</p>
    <p>The county is home to the high­est num­ber of in­fec­tions and fa­tal­i­ties in the US. The jump in cases came two weeks af­ter mil­lions trav­elled across the coun­try for the Thanks­giv­ing break.</p>
    <p>As at yes­ter­day noon, the US had re­ported more than 16 mil­lion Covid-19 in­fec­tions and nearly 298,000 deaths. Los An­ge­les is in week two of its sec­ond lock­down and is part of a re­gion in Cal­i­for­nia that has im­posed more re­stric­tions through the hol­i­day sea­son.</p>
    <p>“Some peo­ple aren’t do­ing what we’re ask­ing them to do, and I think the big­gest prob­lem we have right now is there’s so much trans­mis­sion that when even just a small per­cent­age of peo­ple are not tak­ing sen­si­ble steps to pro­tect them­selves and pro­tect oth­ers, it has a tremen­dous cas­cad­ing im­pact,” Ms Bar­bara Fer­rer, the county’s di­rec­tor of pub­lic health, said.</p>
    <p>The vac­ci­na­tion cam­paign could not be com­ing at a bet­ter time.</p>
    <p>The Pfizer vac­cine has been shown in a clin­i­cal trial of 44,000 peo­ple to be 95 per cent ef­fec­tive in pre­vent­ing Covid-19, and no se­ri­ous safety con­cerns have been iden­ti­fied. The US be­came the sixth coun­try to give the green light to the vac­cine on Fri­day, af­ter Bri­tain, Bahrain, Canada, Saudi Ara­bia and Mex­ico.</p>
