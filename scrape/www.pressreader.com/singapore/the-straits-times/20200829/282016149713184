    <p>United States-China re­la­tions are in a new phase of height­ened strate­gic com­pe­ti­tion. Nuclear de­ter­rence makes war highly im­prob­a­ble. The fear of mu­tu­ally as­sured de­struc­tion will keep the peace be­tween the US and China, as it kept the peace be­tween the US and the Soviet Union for more than 40 years dur­ing the Cold War.</p>
    <p>As dur­ing the Cold War, the US and China will avoid di­rect mil­i­tary con­fronta­tion and find less dan­ger­ous ways to com­pete.</p>
    <p>The US and China are in­ter­de­pen­dent as the US and Soviet Union never were, and in a way never be­fore ex­pe­ri­enced in history by strate­gic ri­vals. They are en­meshed in a com­plex web of sup­ply chains of an in­tri­cacy and so­phis­ti­ca­tion pre­vi­ously un­known in the global econ­omy. This makes com­plete across-the-board de­cou­pling or the cre­ation of two com­pletely sep­a­rate sys­tems im­prob­a­ble.</p>
    <p>But in­ter­de­pen­dence also ac­cen­tu­ates strate­gic mis­trust by high­light­ing crit­i­cal vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties. Sup­ply chains in some do­mains are be­ing dis­rupted and re­ori­ented as China tries to mit­i­gate its vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties and the US gains strate­gic ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>SE­RI­OUS VUL­NER­A­BIL­ITY FOR CHINA</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy, in par­tic­u­lar semi­con­duc­tors, has emerged as a crit­i­cal arena of US-China geopo­lit­i­cal com­pe­ti­tion, far more crit­i­cally so than dur­ing the Cold War.</p>
    <p>Semi­con­duc­tors are a very se­ri­ous vul­ner­a­bil­ity for China. Semi­con­duc­tors of some sort are used in al­most ev­ery­thing that is not purely me­chan­i­cal. Amer­i­can ef­forts to pres­sure or per­suade coun­tries not to adopt Huawei for 5G net­works have drawn the most at­ten­tion. But this is re­ally a sec­ond-or­der is­sue.</p>
    <p>With­out semi­con­duc­tors of the right type, Huawei’s abil­ity to win con­tracts to run 5G net­works is moot. China has made re­mark­able progress in many ar­eas of high tech­nol­ogy. But to ap­ply and take full economic ad­van­tage of what it has achieved, China needs semi­con­duc­tors, which it does not have, or does not have enough of the right type.</p>
    <p>Semi­con­duc­tors are China’s largest im­port, larger than oil.</p>
    <p>China ac­counts for 40 per cent of the global semi­con­duc­tor mar­ket. But only about 9 per cent of China’s needs is made in China. And of the 91 per cent that China needs to im­port, 56 per cent comes from the US. And even the 9 per cent pro­duced in China is mostly from for­eign firms. In 2018, Chi­nese semi­con­duc­tor com­pa­nies ac­counted for only US$4.78 bil­lion (S$6.5 bil­lion) of the</p>
    <p>US$23.8 bil­lion worth of lo­cal pro­duc­tion and were mainly at the low end of the semi­con­duc­tor value chain.</p>
    <p>The high-end semi­con­duc­tor in­dus­try is dom­i­nated by just three firms: In­tel, Sam­sung and Tai­wan Semi­con­duc­tor Man­u­fac­tur­ing Com­pany (TSMC), which are ca­pa­ble of pro­duc­ing at the most ad­vanced process nodes, the in­dus­try term for a spe­cific gen­er­a­tion of man­u­fac­tur­ing process and named ac­cord­ing to its small­est fea­ture size. The three in­dus­try lead­ers are pro­duc­ing at 7 nanome­tres (nm) and push­ing to­wards 5nm and smaller.</p>
    <p>It would not have es­caped the no­tice of Chi­nese strate­gists that two of the three in­dus­try lead­ers are from ju­ris­dic­tions highly de­pen­dent on the US for se­cu­rity (TSMC from Tai­wan and Sam­sung from South Korea) while the third (In­tel) is Amer­i­can.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try ex­perts es­ti­mate that Semi­con­duc­tor Man­u­fac­tur­ing In­ter­na­tional Corp (SMIC),</p>
    <p>China’s prin­ci­pal semi­con­duc­tor fab­ri­ca­tor, is sev­eral gen­er­a­tions, or three to five years, be­hind th­ese lead­ing-edge for­eign de­sign­ers and man­u­fac­tur­ers, and the fron­tiers of semi­con­duc­tor de­sign and pro­duc­tion are con­tin­u­ally mov­ing out­wards.</p>
    <p>SMIC only re­cently be­gan pro­duc­ing semi­con­duc­tors of 14nm. China’s av­er­age is 28nm. China is highly de­pen­dent on TSMC for semi­con­duc­tors of 7nm.</p>
    <p>China does not need high-end semi­con­duc­tors for ev­ery­thing.</p>
    <p>But it needs them for the new tech­nolo­gies that are ex­pected to drive what has been termed the fourth in­dus­trial rev­o­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>This gap in the coun­try’s ca­pa­bil­i­ties is a fail­ure of Chi­nese in­dus­trial pol­icy which Bei­jing is now scram­bling to rec­tify.</p>
    <p>The “Made in China 2025” vi­sion en­vis­ages China pro­duc­ing 80 per cent of its semi­con­duc­tor needs. That is a very am­bi­tious tar­get.</p>
    <p>China has many cre­ative sci­en­tists and is try­ing to at­tract more through its “thou­sand tal­ents” pro­gramme. It will cer­tainly pour vast amounts of money into its semi­con­duc­tor in­dus­try. But it is still go­ing to be very hard for the coun­try to move up the semi­con­duc­tor value chain.</p>
    <p>The US and its al­lies con­trol crit­i­cal tech­nol­ogy choke points in the semi­con­duc­tor man­u­fac­tur­ing process, among them, elec­tronic de­sign au­to­ma­tion (EDM) and ex­treme ul­travi­o­let lithog­ra­phy (EUV). EDM is a cat­e­gory of soft­ware tools used to de­sign elec­tronic sys­tems such as in­te­grated cir­cuits and printed cir­cuit boards. As high-end chips can have bil­lions of com­po­nents, it is ba­si­cally im­pos­si­ble to de­sign them with­out EDMs – which is a tech­nol­ogy con­trolled by just three firms, two of which are Amer­i­can and the third Ger­man.</p>
    <p>It is also ba­si­cally im­pos­si­ble to man­u­fac­ture high-end chips with­out EUV, a tech­nol­ogy crit­i­cal to de­vel­op­ing next-gen­er­a­tion chips that al­low more com­po­nents to be built in­side a chip, pack­ing more speed and power onto smaller chips.</p>
    <p>The US has suc­cess­fully pressed the Nether­lands to block the sale of EUV tech­nol­ogy by a Dutch com­pany to SMIC. EUV tech­nol­ogy con­tains sub­stan­tial amounts of Amer­i­can in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty.</p>
    <p>AMER­I­CAN RE­STRIC­TIONS</p>
    <p>The US re­cently put in place an ar­ray of re­stric­tions on the sale of semi­con­duc­tors to China. The lat­est re­stric­tions, which came into force on Aug 20, pro­hibit any firm “where US soft­ware or tech­nol­ogy is the ba­sis for a for­eign-pro­duced item” from sup­ply­ing Huawei with­out a li­cence from the US Com­merce Depart­ment. This ap­plies to any semi­con­duc­tor com­pany any­where that uses Amer­i­can in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty at any stage of pro­duc­tion. In ef­fect, this means just about every­one and cer­tainly all three in­dus­try lead­ers.</p>
    <p>If strictly ap­plied, th­ese reg­u­la­tions have suc­cess­fully “de­cou­pled” China from the in­ter­na­tional semi­con­duc­tor sup­ply chain.</p>
    <p>Th­ese sweep­ing re­stric­tions can hamper China’s long-term growth tra­jec­tory and its abil­ity to har­ness new tech­nolo­gies at a time when the old Chi­nese growth model is near­ing the end of its shelf life, when the ex­pec­ta­tions of the Chi­nese peo­ple are ris­ing, when struc­tural prob­lems are ac­cu­mu­lat­ing in the Chi­nese econ­omy, and when the Covid-19 pan­demic has al­ready low­ered China’s growth prospects.</p>
    <p>China will not col­lapse. Given suf­fi­cient time and re­sources, it could per­haps pro­duce its own ver­sions of EDMs and EUVs and what­ever else it needs.</p>
    <p>But re­sources are never in­fi­nite and, in strate­gic com­pe­ti­tion, time is a pre­cious re­source. The ob­jec­tive of strate­gic com­pe­ti­tion in the nuclear age is not to de­stroy the ad­ver­sary. That is sim­ply too dan­ger­ous. Rather, the ob­jec­tive is to dis­rupt and de­lay your ad­ver­sary’s plans and force your ad­ver­sary to di­vert re­sources from other uses.</p>
    <p>So far the lat­est re­stric­tions ap­ply only to Huawei.</p>
    <p>CHINA’S OP­TIONS</p>
    <p>Once its stock­pile of semi­con­duc­tors runs out, which in­dus­try ex­perts think will be some time next year, Huawei will col­lapse, un­less it re­ceives a re­prieve by way of its sup­pli­ers re­ceiv­ing a li­cence. But the re­stric­tions could eas­ily be ex­tended to other Chi­nese firms too. SMIC is the next log­i­cal tar­get.</p>
    <p>The US will prob­a­bly even­tu­ally grant some li­cences to ex­port some types of semi­con­duc­tors to Huawei and other Chi­nese com­pa­nies. Af­ter all, deny­ing ex­ports to the ma­jor mar­ket im­poses costs on sup­pli­ers as well, and many sup­pli­ers are Amer­i­can com­pa­nies or com­pa­nies of friends and al­lies. Nor will the US want to make China des­per­ate, as it made Ja­pan des­per­ate be­fore the out­break of World War II by cut­ting off its oil sup­plies.</p>
    <p>But li­cences granted can also be li­cences de­nied. The de­ci­sion is en­tirely in the hands of the US.</p>
    <p>The US gov­ern­ment has its hands around the throats of Huawei and other Chi­nese users of semi­con­duc­tors, and can stran­gle them when­ever it con­sid­ers ex­pe­di­ent. De­ci­sions on li­cences will be made ac­cord­ing to strate­gic and not purely com­mer­cial con­sid­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Semi­con­duc­tor sup­ply chains are very in­tri­cate. The new re­stric­tions give the US the dis­cre­tion to in­ter­vene at any point of a very com­plex and ge­o­graph­i­cally widely dis­trib­uted pro­duc­tion process, from de­sign to fab­ri­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The un­cer­tainty this gen­er­ates for China and sup­pli­ers is a po­tent strate­gic weapon. For­eign sup­pli­ers will not aban­don the China mar­ket, but they will cer­tainly be­come far more cau­tious about what they do in China and for China. Some will shift part of their op­er­a­tions out of China and di­vert planned new fa­cil­i­ties home or to other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>It is not clear that China can ef­fec­tively re­tal­i­ate or cir­cum­vent the re­stric­tions. All the ma­jor ad­vanced economies ca­pa­ble of pro­vid­ing the tech­nol­ogy that China needs – Ja­pan, South Korea, Aus­tralia, the United King­dom and, in the Euro­pean Union, Ger­many, France and the Nether­lands, among oth­ers – share Amer­i­can con­cerns about Chi­nese be­hav­iour. Re­tal­i­a­tion could only har­den those con­cerns.</p>
    <p>While China is im­por­tant, the US is even more im­por­tant to them in both economic and strate­gic terms. Bei­jing’s best hope is that a new US ad­min­is­tra­tion will take a dif­fer­ent ap­proach. This is a for­lorn hope.</p>
    <p>A Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion – if there is a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion, which is not yet to be taken for granted de­spite polls sug­gest­ing Demo­cratic Party nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den has more sup­port than in­cum­bent Don­ald Trump – is un­likely to re­move or even sub­stan­tially mod­ify the re­stric­tions. It would prob­a­bly im­ple­ment them within a more or­derly and trans­par­ent de­ci­sion-mak­ing process. This may mit­i­gate con­di­tions for sup­pli­ers, but not for China.</p>
    <p>The Asean coun­tries in the semi­con­duc­tor sup­ply chain, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, will have to deal with the geopol­i­tics of semi­con­duc­tors as a long-term fac­tor. Techno-na­tion­al­ism is here to stay.</p>
