    <p>The Covid-19 outbreak has not stopped Sin­ga­pore­ans from spruc­ing up their hous­ing es­tates for Na­tional Day, with dec­o­ra­tions al­ready preva­lent a week be­fore the coun­try cel­e­brates its 55th birth­day.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude three struc­tures made up of light-emit­ting diodes near Block 187A Be­dok North Street 4, which light up daily from 7pm to 10pm.</p>
    <p>The struc­tures are meant to “lift up the res­i­dents’ spir­its”, said Mr Kee Sek Soon, 49, who is the vicechair­man of the Feng­shan Com­mu­nity Club Man­age­ment Com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>Mr Kee, who spear­headed the dec­o­ra­tion ef­fort, said that var­i­ous Feng­shan grass­roots or­gan­i­sa­tions were in­volved in the plan­ning and cre­ation of th­ese struc­tures.</p>
    <p>At Yew Tee, res­i­dents com­peted in dec­o­rat­ing their neigh­bour­hoods.</p>
    <p>Yew Tee Zone 10 Res­i­dents’ Com­mit­tee (RC) was de­clared the win­ner yes­ter­day with a dis­play near Block 631 Choa Chu Kang North 6 that in­cluded heart-shaped card­board plac­ards and a card­board lion with lights at­tached to it.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim Geok Kheng, the chair of the RC, said that re­cy­cled ma­te­ri­als were used in the dis­play.</p>
    <p>Yew Tee Zone 8 RC, whose dec­o­ra­tions near Block 673 Choa Chu Kang Cres­cent in­cluded a Mer­lion made from re­cy­cled bad­minton shut­tle­cocks, came in se­cond. The shut­tle­cocks were do­nated by res­i­dents, said RC chair Jenny Chen, 60.</p>
    <p>Six RCs and three neigh­bour­hood com­mit­tees in all took part in the com­pe­ti­tion in Yew Tee.</p>
    <p>PAs­sionArts, a divi­sion of the Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion, is also in­volved in Na­tional Day dec­o­ra­tions through the “HeARTs in Unity” project.</p>
    <p>A col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween PAs­sionArts, the var­i­ous com­mu­nity arts and cul­ture clubs (CACCs) and the NDP2020 ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee, the project fea­tures pho­to­graphs of res­i­dents on art­work hung from the fa­cade of Hous­ing Board blocks across Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 11 HDB blocks, si­t­u­ated in hous­ing es­tates such as Jurong East, Nee Soon and Tampines, will be dis­play­ing the art­work, all of which have been de­signed by lo­cal artists, by Sun­day.</p>
    <p>So far, nine art in­stal­la­tions have been set up, in­clud­ing at Block 319 Cle­menti Av­enue 4 and Block 365 Wood­lands Av­enue 5.</p>
    <p>Project co­or­di­na­tor Jo­lene Wong, 27, said that the pur­pose of the project is to en­gage res­i­dents and boost their morale.</p>
    <p>The blocks dis­play­ing the art­work were se­lected be­cause they were at prom­i­nent lo­ca­tions with high traf­fic flow, she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Mindy Ding, 52, the chair of Wood­grove CACC, which is in­volved in the Wood­lands in­stal­la­tion, said that the piece is very “close to the heart”.</p>
    <p>“It is about fam­i­lies and groups of friends com­ing to­gether,” she said.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal artist Ama­lina Ah­mad, 30, who de­signed the art in­stal­la­tions at Cle­menti and Tampines, said that the project was a good op­por­tu­nity for her to bring the com­mu­nity closer through art.</p>
    <p>“It serves as a re­minder that we are all in this dif­fi­cult phase to­gether,” said the cre­ative di­rec­tor of Hikari Art Stu­dio.</p>
