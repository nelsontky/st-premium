    <p>When hockey player Tif­fany Lim first joined the na­tional Un­der-21 squad last year, the then 15-yearold felt out of place as she was the youngest in team.</p>
    <p>While she felt in­tim­i­dated by her older and more ex­pe­ri­enced team­mates, they were wel­com­ing and helped her to master skills on the pitch. Off the pitch, they would also show in­ter­est in her life and of­fer ad­vice.</p>
    <p>The Seng Kang Se­condary School stu­dent said: “My team­mates al­ways give me op­por­tu­ni­ties that al­low me to im­prove and be­come a bet­ter player.”</p>
    <p>She took about two months to gel with her team­mates and now feels a part of the team, who won the Ai­rA­sia Women’s Ju­nior Asian Hockey Fed­er­a­tion Cup in Sin­ga­pore last year.</p>
    <p>Tif­fany’s suc­cess at the tour­na­ment and her ef­forts in school saw her named the Best Sports­girl for hockey at this year’s Sin­ga­pore Sports Coun­cil (SSSC) Colours Awards.</p>
    <p>The 16-year-old has been vol­un­teer­ing as a school sports leader since Se­condary 1, a role that re­quires her to help out at ma­jor sports events in her school, as well as as­sist other schools with their sports car­ni­vals.</p>
    <p>The award came as a sur­prise to Tif­fany, who has been play­ing hockey for six years. She said: “I was quite scep­ti­cal that they would choose me be­cause I’m just a reg­u­lar girl in a neigh­bour­hood school and af­ter I heard the news, I was quite happy be­cause my dili­gence hasn’t gone un­no­ticed, which mo­ti­vates me to do bet­ter in fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>Tif­fany was one of the 39 Best Sports­boy and Best Sports­girl win­ners of the SSSC Colours Awards, which saw 309 stu­dent-ath­letes recog­nised for their sport­ing achieve­ments and good char­ac­ter this year.</p>
