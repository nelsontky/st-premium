    <p>The amount of govern­ment fi­nan­cial sup­port an­nu­ally that is po­ten­tially en­vi­ron­men­tally harm­ful, from fos­sil fuel sub­si­dies to land clear­ing, says a re­port by the UN Con­ven­tion on Bi­o­log­i­cal Di­ver­sity (CBD). It says sub­si­dies for pro­duc­tion of com­modi­ties linked to for­est de­struc­tion in Brazil and In­done­sia alone were es­ti­mated in 2015 to ex­ceed by a fac­tor of 100 or more the amount spent on mea­sures to com­bat de­for­esta­tion.</p>
    <p>TAR­GETS WAY OFF TRACK</p>
    <p>In 2010, world na­tions agreed on 20 tar­gets, called the Aichi Biodiversi­ty Tar­gets, that aimed to ar­rest the de­cline of na­ture, from forests to reefs to fish stocks, by this year.</p>
    <p>The tar­gets were agreed on un­der the CBD. In a progress re­port on the tar­gets in Septem­ber 2020, the CBD con­cluded progress has been far too lit­tle and that only six of the tar­gets were par­tially achieved and none were fully achieved.</p>
    <p>The rate of de­for­esta­tion has fallen glob­ally by about a third com­pared with the pre­vi­ous decade.</p>
    <p>Pro­tected ar­eas on land in­creased dur­ing the 2000-2020 pe­riod from about 10 per cent to at least 15 per cent and from about 3 per cent to at least</p>
    <p>7 per cent in ma­rine ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Al­most 100 coun­tries have incorporat­ed biodiversi­ty val­ues into na­tional ac­count­ing sys­tems.</p>
    <p>De­stroy­ing ecosys­tems, such as rain­forests, also places hu­mans in closer con­tact with an­i­mals and dis­eases that can spread to hu­mans, such as Sars.</p>
