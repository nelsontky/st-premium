    <p>Ex­pect more wet weather with tem­per­a­tures dipping to 22 deg C on a few days in the first half of this month, said the weather­man on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Ser­vice Sin­ga­pore (MSS) said show­ers are fore­cast for most days in the next two weeks due to pre­vail­ing north-east mon­soon con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Daily tem­per­a­ture will mostly range be­tween 24 deg C and 33 deg C, and could hit 34 deg C on one or two days.</p>
    <p>De­cem­ber is typ­i­cally wettest month of the year.</p>
    <p>These show­ers are ex­pected over parts of the is­land in the af­ter­noons, but may ex­tend to the evenings. the</p>
    <p>On a few days, in­tense thun­dery rain will be wide­spread due to the con­ver­gence of winds over Sin­ga­pore and the sur­round­ing re­gion. Stronger winds can be ex­pected in the sec­ond week of this month.</p>
    <p>MSS said last month was the sec­ond-coolest Novem­ber in the past decade, with a monthly mean tem­per­a­ture of 27.2 deg C.</p>
    <p>Rain­fall was also higher for most parts of the is­land, with the high­est anom­aly of 78 per cent above av­er­age recorded in Paya Le­bar.</p>
    <p>Heavy rain led to flash floods and fallen trees in parts of Sin­ga­pore on Nov 2. The high­est daily to­tal rain­fall for the month was recorded at 134.2mm in Paya Le­bar on the same day, said MSS.</p>
    <p>Wa­ter lev­els in drains and canals</p>
    <p>across Sin­ga­pore trig­gered flood warn­ings for 12 lo­ca­tions on Nov 22.</p>
    <p>MSS said these in­tense show­ers could be at­trib­uted to strong so­lar heat­ing of land ar­eas as well as the large-scale con­ver­gence of winds over Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>While La Nina con­di­tions may have in­flu­enced rain­fall, MSS said that other fac­tors such as mon­soonal and lo­cal wind con­di­tions were more sig­nif­i­cant.</p>
    <p>There were also a few warm days last month, mainly in the first fort­night of the month. The high­est daily tem­per­a­ture of 34.9 deg C was recorded in Cle­menti on Nov 5 and Paya Le­bar on Nov 12.</p>
