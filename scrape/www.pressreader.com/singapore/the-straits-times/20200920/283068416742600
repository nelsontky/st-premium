    <p>Ro­bots may have made their de­but as gim­micky gad­gets to draw din­ers to restau­rants in the past few years. But they are now pos­ing as a se­ri­ous com­pe­ti­tion for jobs in this ser­vice in­dus­try due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic which dis­cour­ages close hu­man con­tacts.</p>
    <p>Some restau­rants in China have al­ready cut down on hu­man em­ploy­ees as they use tech­nol­ogy to drive their busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, China’s Tai Er chain, which spe­cialises in sauer­kraut fish, a pop­u­lar Sichuan-style dish, has din­ers or­der di­rectly from the restau­rant’s WeChat ac­count. Other than the one waiter who puts the food on the ta­ble, the bill is set­tled with mo­bile pay­ment apps such as Ten­cent’s WeChat Pay.</p>
    <p>But even such jobs are now at risk, with de­liv­ery ro­bots no longer an un­com­mon sight at trendy hot­pot restau­rants in Shang­hai.</p>
    <p>De­signed like tray carts – some even with com­i­cal ex­pres­sions – th­ese ro­bots roam around kitchens and hall­ways, bring­ing plates of raw meat, vegeta­bles and tofu to your ta­ble.</p>
    <p>China is well ahead of other coun­tries in restau­rant au­to­ma­tion. Early this year, UBS Group found that 64 per cent of the Chi­nese re­spon­dents to its sur­vey said they had or­dered meals via their mo­bile de­vices at least once a week, ver­sus only 17 per cent in the US.</p>
    <p>With dig­i­tal-or­der­ing ubiq­ui­tous, ro­bot wait­ers and chefs are the next log­i­cal step.</p>
    <p>The eco­nom­ics is start­ing to work in ro­bots’ favour too.</p>
    <p>Th­ese days, a chef typ­i­cally costs up to 10,000 yuan (S$2,000) a month, while a server can earn up to 4,000 yuan. But a restau­rant owner can rent a de­liv­ery ro­bot built by Shang­hai-based Keenon Ro­bot­ics for 3,000 yuan a month.</p>
    <p>As for ro­bot dim sum chefs, you can buy a dumpling ma­chine from</p>
    <p>Guangzhou Xuzhong Food Ma­chin­ery for 26,800 yuan. As it comes with a one-year ser­vice guar­an­tee, this works out to be barely 2,300 yuan a month.</p>
    <p>This is why the pop­u­lar hot-pot restau­rant chain Haidi­lao vows to even­tu­ally con­vert some lo­ca­tions to smart restau­rants. Known for its long op­er­at­ing hours and ar­ray of services, which span man­i­cures and shoe shines while you are wait­ing for a ta­ble, Haidi­lao man­aged an im­pres­sive ta­ble turnover rate of 5.2 at the store-level last year.</p>
    <p>But this has its price – it has to hire a lot of work­ers. Labour costs ac­counted for 30.7 per cent of sales last year, ver­sus 19.7 per cent at Tai Er, ac­cord­ing to HSBC Hold­ings.</p>
    <p>Haidi­lao’s first flag­ship smart restau­rant in Bei­jing, which opened al­most two years ago, show­cases how ro­bots can save money. It has a cold room that houses nine ro­botic arms made by Pana­sonic. Th­ese ap­pendages pick fresh meat and vegeta­bles from a shelf, place them on a con­veyor belt, and pass them for hu­man in­spec­tion be­fore be­ing placed on Keenon’s ro­bot wait­ers.</p>
    <p>The re­sult is a whop­ping 37 per cent re­duc­tion in staff, or a monthly sav­ings of 172,000 yuan. Covid-19 is per­haps a wake-up call be­cause a smart kitchen and con­tact-free ser­vice could re­duce the chance of food con­tam­i­na­tion and give con­sumers some peace of mind.</p>
    <p>Tai Er has a very sim­ple menu: the sig­na­ture spicy fish dish, of­fered in three sizes, and no more than 23 ba­sic add-ons, which in­clude bev­er­ages and ex­tra soup ingredient­s. True, Haidi­lao stores are larger and stock more than 100 items for the boil­ing pot. But in both cases, cook­ing largely comes down to pre­par­ing a soup base, which can eas­ily be done by ro­bot chefs. In fact, the per­fect blend of Sichuan cui­sine’s two flavours – spicy and numb­ing – have lit­tle room for er­ror, so au­to­ma­tion could come in handy.</p>
    <p>The ro­bot con­cept can eas­ily ex­tend be­yond Sichuan spicy soups. Fresh seafood mar­kets at the Bos­ton or San Fran­cisco piers can bor­row the con­cept from Alibaba Group’s smart restau­rant Ro­bot.He in Shang­hai. Hu­mans still as­sist and cook, but a ro­botic arm places seafood into a re­frig­er­a­tor so it stays cool un­til the cus­tomer is seated and ready to eat. Sim­i­larly, mak­ing a salad bowl is per­fectly suited to ro­bot prepa­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>Is it such a bad thing that ro­bots are re­plac­ing hu­mans? We don’t have to frown over a stray hair or un­wanted pieces of corn in our salad bowls. There are le­git­i­mate wor­ries that ro­bots are tak­ing our jobs. But in China’s big cities, mil­len­ni­als are not will­ing to wait ta­bles, any­how. They’d rather open stores on Alibaba’s e-com­merce site Taobao or strive to be­come so­cial in­flu­encers via livestream­ing. China’s US$671 bil­lion (S$912 bil­lion) cater­ing in­dus­try has no choice but to be smart, an­ti­so­cial and ro­botic.</p>
