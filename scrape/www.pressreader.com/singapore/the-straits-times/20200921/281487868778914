    <p>Last Wed­nes­day, the United States Fed­eral Re­serve an­nounced it will keep in­ter­est rates near zero for years un­til the US econ­omy heals from the ef­fects of the Covid-19 pan­demic and the labour mar­ket re­cov­ers.</p>
    <p>The US stance of “lower for longer” on in­ter­est rates has also been widely adopted glob­ally as cen­tral banks ex­pand bal­ance sheets in step with gov­ern­ment fis­cal sup­port to prop up economies badly dam­aged by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, in­ter­est rates have plunged to their low­est lev­els in decades. The Sin­ga­pore In­ter­bank Of­fered Rate or Si­bor is now un­der 0.5 per cent, com­pared with al­most 1.5 per cent over a year ago.</p>
    <p>This has been wel­come news for bor­row­ers. Banks have seen a del­uge of mort­gage re­struc­tur­ings, with bor­row­ers opt­ing for lower fixed rates, sav­ing them as much as half their in­ter­est pay­ments.</p>
    <p>Home pur­chases have also risen sharply re­cently de­spite the pan­demic, as the cost of bor­row­ing comes down.</p>
    <p>In short, the low in­ter­est rate en­vi­ron­ment has been a boon for the prop­erty mar­ket and as­set pur­chasers, given that fi­nanc­ing has be­come cheaper and more ac­ces­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Lower in­ter­est rates are also gen­er­ally good for busi­nesses and the stock mar­ket. Busi­nesses can bor­row at lower cost and ex­pand. As for the stock mar­ket, the higher liq­uid­ity en­vi­ron­ment will nat­u­rally lift all boats. The fact that mar­kets are con­tin­u­ing to climb to new heights amid dam­aged real economies is a sign that this is al­ready hap­pen­ing.</p>
    <p>How­ever, an ex­tended low in­ter­est rate en­vi­ron­ment is a dou­ble-edged sword.</p>
    <p>While it will ben­e­fit seg­ments of the econ­omy, es­pe­cially par­tic­u­lar as­set mar­kets, it re­sults in a lower yield en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>This has crit­i­cal im­pli­ca­tions for fast-grey­ing so­ci­eties like Sin­ga­pore. By some es­ti­mates, one in four Sin­ga­pore­ans will be re­tired by 2030. Given the qual­ity of life and health­care, many 60-year-olds in Sin­ga­pore today will likely live well into their 90s. So we are talk­ing about a so­ci­ety where a quar­ter of its cit­i­zens could be liv­ing on re­turns on re­tire­ment sav­ings for up to 30 years.</p>
    <p>While most Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents have Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund sav­ings, this alone will not be suf­fi­cient if the cost of liv­ing con­tin­ues to creep up over the years. Many will – and should – put funds in yield-ac­cre­tive as­sets such as in­sur­ance and pen­sion funds that de­liver a de­cent rate of re­turn. And therein lies the prob­lem. Many in­sur­ance and pen­sion funds could find them­selves un­able to de­liver the re­turns and yields pro­jected ear­lier when they sold their poli­cies and plans. This means less pay­outs to the as­set hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Par­ents who pur­chased en­dow­ment poli­cies to fi­nance their chil­dren’s ed­u­ca­tion in, say, 20 years, could find their bonus pay­outs fall­ing far short of ear­lier pro­jec­tions.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, fixed de­posit rates in Sin­ga­pore have al­ready fallen by over 100 ba­sis points over the past year. Today, it stands at around</p>
    <p>0.6 per cent, com­pared with al­most 2 per cent or more a year ago. So if you had $1 mil­lion stashed in the bank last year, you would get al­most $20,000 a year, or some $1,600 per month. Today, that $1 mil­lion will earn you about $6,000 a year, or $500 a month.</p>
    <p>In short, low in­ter­est rates mean lower re­turns on in­vest­ments, re­tire­ment sav­ings, ed­u­ca­tion funds and even in­ter-gen­er­a­tional trans­fers.</p>
    <p>The fall in re­turns could prompt a scram­ble for yield. Many could reach for riskier as­sets, with equities the most ob­vi­ous choice.</p>
    <p>If the right picks are made, for ex­am­ple, stocks that de­liver strong and sus­tained div­i­dends, re­tirees and in­vestors might be able to prop­erly re­bal­ance their port­fo­lios. Oth­er­wise, more money could be lost.</p>
    <p>Low in­ter­est rates over a pro­longed pe­riod will also im­pact banks and fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions, es­pe­cially if lend­ing rates move down faster than de­posit rates. The com­pres­sion of in­ter­est mar­gins will put pres­sure on banks’ profit. The re­cent re­treat in the stock prices of banks sug­gests some in­vestors are al­ready pric­ing in such a sce­nario.</p>
    <p>A low in­ter­est rate en­vi­ron­ment could also im­pact bond mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Is­suers who tapped mar­kets some years ago and are pay­ing, say, 4 per cent, could be tempted to re­deem their bonds. Why pay 4 per cent to lenders when there is a 2 per cent loan to be had from the banks?</p>
    <p>Again, this would im­pact bond hold­ers and pen­sion funds that in­vested for long-term sta­ble re­turns.</p>
    <p>As Mr Ni­cola Mai and Dr Peder Beck-Friis from Pimco noted, per­sis­tent low rates could lead to in­sta­bil­ity in var­i­ous sec­tors and po­ten­tially trig­ger calls for cap­i­tal in­jec­tions into cor­po­rate pen­sion plans and in­sur­ance com­pa­nies over time.</p>
    <p>A “lower for longer” in­ter­est rate en­vi­ron­ment is symp­to­matic of poor eco­nomic cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>While some will ben­e­fit, many oth­ers may not.</p>
    <p>But there are some things you could do to mit­i­gate the im­pact and take ad­van­tage of it.</p>
    <p>First, re­struc­ture all your loans, es­pe­cially your hous­ing loan.</p>
    <p>Lower fixed rates are avail­able now.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, con­sol­i­date all your debt in a man­ner that will en­able you to re­duce your in­ter­est pay­ments.</p>
    <p>Third, take cal­cu­lated risks in the stock mar­ket. Con­sider dol­lar-cost av­er­ag­ing, which is buy­ing a lit­tle at a time to keep av­er­age cost down.</p>
    <p>Con­sider ac­cu­mu­lat­ing higher yield­ing as­sets such as real es­tate in­vest­ment trusts and other stocks that have strong up­side. But do your home­work and study com­pa­nies’ bal­ance sheets and fun­da­men­tals. Also con­sider buy­ing some bonds. There are nu­mer­ous re­tail bonds here that of­fer sta­bil­ity and rea­son­able re­turns.</p>
    <p>Gold and other pre­cious met­als could also be ben­e­fi­cia­ries of the low in­ter­est rate en­vi­ron­ment. On the other hand, cur­ren­cies like the US dol­lar could weaken con­sid­er­ably.</p>
    <p>As Mr Vasu Menon, OCBC Bank’s ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor for in­vest­ment strat­egy and wealth man­age­ment, put it: “Di­ver­sify over time and as­set classes. In an en­vi­ron­ment like this, you need to seek out yield. The easy money on the stock mar­ket, 20 to 30 per cent gains, has al­ready been made. Aim for high sin­gle-digit gains now.”</p>
    <p>Of course, the low in­ter­est rate en­vi­ron­ment is also a good time to ac­cu­mu­late as­sets like prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>If you do de­cide on an in­vest­ment prop­erty, keep in mind lower in­ter­est rates for longer does not mean lower in­ter­est rates for­ever. If jobs are lost and the ex­pa­tri­ate community shrinks, de­mand for rental prop­erty could also slide.</p>
    <p>In­ter­est rates in Ja­pan col­lapsed af­ter the 1990s as­set bub­ble and have yet to re­cover. A com­bi­na­tion of de­clin­ing pop­u­la­tion and high as­set prices means yields could re­main low over the longer term.</p>
    <p>With the global econ­omy strug­gling to find its way back amid the pan­demic and de­pressed de­mand, cen­tral banks are poised to con­tinue ex­pand­ing bal­ance sheets.</p>
    <p>In­ter­est rates will likely re­main low for the next three to five years.</p>
    <p>Win­ners and losers will be sep­a­rated by the qual­ity and sus­tain­abil­ity of their as­sets.</p>
    <p>Whether you are in your 60s – who has in­vested for re­tire­ment re­turns – or in your 40s – who has set aside funds for your chil­dren – spend some time to eval­u­ate how your in­vest­ments are im­pacted.</p>
    <p>Re­fine your pri­or­i­ties, re­cal­i­brate your port­fo­lio and re­al­lo­cate your funds where nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Low in­ter­est rates mean lower re­turns on in­vest­ments, re­tire­ment sav­ings, ed­u­ca­tion funds and even in­ter-gen­er­a­tional trans­fers. The fall in re­turns could prompt a scram­ble for yield.</p>
