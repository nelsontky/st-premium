    <p>LON­DON • Re­nault have with­drawn their ap­peal to the FIA, For­mula One’s gov­ern­ing body, against the pu­n­ish­ment im­posed on Rac­ing Point for copy­ing Mercedes’ brake ducts, the French team said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Stew­ards have docked Rac­ing Point 15 points and i mposed a €400,000 (S$646,000) fine for a breach of the sport­ing reg­u­la­tions at ev­ery race since the Aus­trian sea­son-opener.</p>
    <p>Re­nault had joined Fer­rari in protest­ing the stew­ards’ de­ci­sion, seek­ing a stiffer penalty against the team owned by Cana­dian bil­lion­aire Lawrence Stroll.</p>
    <p>But they have de­cided against tak­ing the mat­ter to FIA’s In­ter­na­tional Court of Ap­peal, leav­ing Fer­rari the only team still chas­ing the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>“Be­yond the de­ci­sions, the mat­ters at is­sue were vi­tal to the in­tegrity of F1, both dur­ing the cur­rent sea­son and in the fu­ture,” Re­nault said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, in­ten­sive and con­struc­tive work be­tween the FIA, Re­nault... and all F1 stake­hold­ers has led to con­crete progress in safe­guard­ing the orig­i­nal­ity in the sport by way of amend­ments to the Sport­ing and Tech­ni­cal Reg­u­la­tions planned for the 2021 rac­ing sea­son, con­firm­ing the re­quire­ments to qual­ify as a con­struc­tor.</p>
    <p>“Reach­ing this strate­gic ob­jec­tive, in the con­text of the new Con­corde Agree­ment, was our pri­or­ity. The controvers­y of the start of this sea­son should be put be­hind us, as we need to fo­cus on the re­main­der of an in­tense and unique cham­pi­onship.”</p>
    <p>Rac­ing Point, whose car this sea­son is a close copy of last year’s Mercedes, have been al­lowed to con­tinue com­pet­ing without hav­ing to re­design the of­fend­ing parts.</p>
    <p>Separately, for­mer Re­nault team prin­ci­pal Flavio Bri­a­tore was hos­pi­talised on Tues­day af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19. The flam­boy­ant Ital­ian busi­ness­man, 70, has been a fierce critic of re­stric­tions aimed at curb­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He is warded at Mi­lan’s San Raf­faele hospi­tal, and his con­di­tion is said to be “good and sta­ble”.</p>
    <p>Bri­a­tore, who men­tored world cham­pion driv­ers Michael Schu­macher and Fer­nando Alonso, also owns the Bil­lion­aire night­club on the Ital­ian re­sort is­land of Sar­dinia.</p>
    <p>His club has since been iden­ti­fied as a Covid-19 hotspot with more than 60 staff mem­bers and guests test­ing pos­i­tive in re­cent days.</p>
