    <p>The speed with which Covid-19 spread round the globe and shifted the nor­mal has been as­tound­ing, and we are still try­ing to fig­ure out how it will af­fect the way we live, study, work and play af­ter the pan­demic has passed.</p>
    <p>For schools, the adap­ta­tion to home-based learn­ing (HBL) has been swift. Schools were shut down all over the world for two to three months and are only grad­u­ally re­open­ing with safe­guards against in­fec­tion, such as safe dis­tanc­ing, tem­per­a­ture-tak­ing, masks, re­duced num­bers, and so on.</p>
    <p>Not ev­ery sys­tem in the world was ready for HBL with tech­nol­ogy plat­forms, ed­u­ca­tional re­sources, adapt­able teach­ers and In­ter­net band­width at home. Sin­ga­pore did well to quickly adapt its Stu­dent Learn­ing Space so that students could con­tinue with some learn­ing, though without the so­cial in­ter­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>What fur­ther changes are likely to await us af­ter this ex­pe­ri­ence?</p>
    <p>HOW IT ALL BE­GAN</p>
    <p>First, it’s im­por­tant to look at the ex­ist­ing ed­u­ca­tional sys­tem as it is now.</p>
    <p>Today’s sys­tem, world­wide, is adopted from the in­dus­trial model de­vel­oped in 18th- and 19th-cen­tury Europe, de­signed to pro­duce young work­ers – chil­dren of agri­cul­tural work­ers – for fac­tory own­ers and in­dus­tri­al­ists.</p>
    <p>The re­quire­ment was to pro­duce students who could fol­low or­ders, were dis­ci­plined, did not ques­tion the ex­ist­ing hi­er­ar­chy, and had ba­sic nu­mer­acy, lit­er­acy and skills to work in a me­chan­i­cal en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>The char­ac­ter­is­tics of this model were schools and class­rooms; teach­ing by rep­e­ti­tion and learn­ing by rote; lock-step pro­gres­sion by age-co­hort, and tests to de­ter­mine learn­ing ac­cord­ing to a stan­dard­ised cur­ricu­lum.</p>
    <p>The pil­lars of such a sys­tem are: schools, students, teach­ers, a stan­dard­ised cur­ricu­lum and as­sess­ment and gov­er­nance.</p>
    <p>To a large ex­tent, we have not moved the nee­dle much since those days. Schools and class­rooms are still brick and mor­tar, of stan­dard sizes.</p>
    <p>Students con­tinue to at­tend these phys­i­cal schools by age-co­hort, ac­cord­ing to a pre­scribed daily timetable which com­prises in­di­vid­ual sub­jects.</p>
    <p>Teach­ers stand in front of the class and re­main an authority fig­ure as the source of cor­rect knowl­edge, val­ues and dis­ci­pline.</p>
    <p>The cur­ricu­lum is fixed by a cen­tral body which de­ter­mines what should be learnt by students – a state-le­git­imised cur­ricu­lum – and students are tested against this. Pro­gres­sion de­pends on students reach­ing ex­ter­nally man­dated stan­dards.</p>
    <p>Why has this sys­tem stood for three cen­turies without sig­nif­i­cant change, though the world around it has changed ex­po­nen­tially?</p>
    <p>A pri­mary rea­son is that the sys­tem has worked well to the ben­e­fit of busi­ness and in­dus­try, pro­duc­ing pli­ant em­ploy­ees who are nu­mer­ate and lit­er­ate.</p>
    <p>A sec­ond rea­son is that it is not easy to re­form a well-es­tab­lished ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem due to legacy and struc­tural rigidi­ties. To even make in­cre­men­tal changes re­quires changes across a vast and com­plex sys­tem, and over­com­ing re­sis­tance from or­gan­ised stake­hold­ers like bu­reau­crats, par­ents, teach­ers’ unions and con­ser­va­tive politi­cians.</p>
    <p>FU­TURE PIL­LARS</p>
    <p>The pil­lars of ed­u­ca­tion will still be the same as at present – cur­ricu­lum, schools, teach­ers, tech­nol­ogy, gov­er­nance and students. How­ever, what they mean in fu­ture will be un­recog­nis­able.</p>
    <p>Cur­ricu­lum: The cur­rent se­quen­tial and lin­ear na­ture of learn­ing will be­come ob­so­lete, giv­ing way to a more var­ied and in­ter­est­ing “on-de­mand” cur­ricu­lum, rather than a fixed and struc­tured one. Stu­dent progress can be tracked through ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) and con­tin­u­ous adap­tive test­ing, al­low­ing each stu­dent to have a unique cur­ricu­lum that is non-lin­ear and based on ap­ti­tude and tal­ent.</p>
    <p>Sub­jects will give way to themes, with mul­ti­dis­ci­plinary and sys­tems-ori­ented ap­proaches to con­tent. Text­books will dis­ap­pear, re­placed by more dy­namic on­line ma­te­rial in 3D or 4D. Students will have a much broader range of choices – in what they want to learn, how, when and with whom.</p>
    <p>Cur­ric­ula will move to­wards be­com­ing more re­la­tion­ship-based, deal­ing with in­ter­ac­tions, ethics and val­ues. These will pre­pare students to face con­tin­u­ous dis­rup­tion with equa­nim­ity and re­silience. The em­pha­sis will move to­wards in­creas­ing ca­pac­ity for life­long learn­ing and know­ing what is needed on a “just-in-time” ba­sis.</p>
    <p>Cer­ti­fi­ca­tion of learn­ing through com­mon, stan­dard­ised and age-based land­mark ex­am­i­na­tions will dis­ap­pear.</p>
    <p>Schools: With AI, it would be in­creas­ingly pos­si­ble to track each stu­dent’s learn­ing ca­pac­ity, pace, ap­ti­tude, and progress. In fu­ture, students can learn and progress at their own in­di­vid­ual rate without be­ing sub­ject to the re­stric­tions of their age-co­hort.</p>
    <p>Mixed age groups will be­come the norm, with students mov­ing about as in­di­vid­u­als and not as a class.</p>
    <p>Learn­ing will be driven by the students them­selves, ac­cord­ing to many op­tions avail­able, and need not be even on a full-time ba­sis.</p>
    <p>Schools in the cur­rent form would be ob­so­lete as they are geared to­wards an out­dated de­liv­ery model. Stan­dard class­rooms will give way to more di­verse learn­ing spaces such as malls, home, civic and com­mu­nity cen­tres, places of wor­ship, fac­to­ries, zoos and hos­pi­tals – and pos­si­bly con­ducted by lay per­sons.</p>
    <p>Teach­ers: Teach­ing as we now know it could dis­ap­pear since knowl­edge and in­for­ma­tion is al­ready freely avail­able or by sub­scrip­tion. On­line tu­tor­ing by world-class in­struc­tors will be avail­able, us­ing ma­chine learn­ing and AI tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>The authority of teach­ers as sub­ject-mat­ter ex­perts will be eroded. In­stead, teach­ers will be­come moral guides, putting is­sues in con­text and mod­er­at­ing dis­cus­sions, and men­tor­ing them on their learn­ing curves.</p>
    <p>These changes will re­de­fine who can be­come teach­ers and how they are pre­pared for their new roles. In the new world, teach­ers will be­come students and vice-versa.</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy: Tech­nol­ogy will play a key role in the trans­for­ma­tion of the ed­u­ca­tion land­scape, not just in the de­liv­ery of con­tent, but also in de­ter­min­ing the cur­ricu­lum for each stu­dent, mod­u­lat­ing the de­liv­ery meth­ods across a spec­trum of op­tions and pro­vid­ing in­di­vid­ual feed­back.</p>
    <p>Gov­er­nance: With these changes, there will be chal­lenges to the public sec­tor from the pri­vate ed­u­ca­tion mar­ket. The man­dated stan­dard le­git­imised cur­ricu­lum will give way to a more open ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem where con­tent is sourced from any­where.</p>
    <p>Stresses will ap­pear in the public sec­tor and is­sues of eq­uity and ac­cess will be­come ac­cen­tu­ated. New reg­u­la­tions and laws may be needed to ad­dress is­sues of na­tional pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>Au­ton­omy at the school level, with par­ents, em­ploy­ers and the com­mu­nity play­ing a greater part in the man­age­ment of the school, and in ex­tend­ing the school be­yond its phys­i­cal struc­ture, will be the new gov­er­nance model.</p>
    <p>Students: They will con­tinue to be the core of the new ed­u­ca­tional sys­tem. They will have to get used to the fact that their friends will change reg­u­larly, they will have to make more in­formed choices, and de­cide what ar­eas they would like mas­tery over. Their mas­tery over tech­nol­ogy will be the first to be ob­vi­ous.</p>
    <p>Cer­tainly, they will learn to take charge of their own lives with greater con­fi­dence and de­velop the ca­pac­ity to un­der­stand and dis­cover their own un­lim­ited po­ten­tial.</p>
    <p>Students at the higher lev­els will seek mean­ing in their study rather than study for a piece of paper.</p>
    <p>CHAL­LENGES AHEAD</p>
    <p>We have out­lined what we think needs to hap­pen and will hap­pen. How­ever, it will be ob­structed by vested in­ter­ests, fear of the new and un­known and loss of con­trol.</p>
    <p>How to bring teach­ers, ed­u­ca­tors and par­ents on board will be the main chal­lenge. This can be achieved through con­sul­ta­tion, com­mu­ni­ca­tion and sce­nario-plan­ning the fu­ture. Po­lit­i­cal will and abil­ity to take a long-term view will be crit­i­cal. In­cre­men­tal­ism, though ap­peal­ing to the risk-averse, needs to give way to more ex­per­i­men­tal­ism.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor S. Gopinathan is the former dean of the Schoolof Ed­u­ca­tion at the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Ed­u­ca­tion. Dr N. Vara­prasad was the found­ing prin­ci­pal of Te­masek Polytech­nic, deputy pres­i­dent of the Na­tional University of Sin­ga­pore and CEO of the Na­tional Li­brary Board.</p>
    <p>Both are prin­ci­pal con­sul­tants at the Sin­ga­pore Ed­u­ca­tion Con­sult­ing Group.</p>
