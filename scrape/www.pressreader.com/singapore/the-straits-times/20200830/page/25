        | | The Sunday Times A25 Sunday, August 30, 2020 BY JEREMY THESEIRA Jobs, jobs, jobs. That has been the catchphras­e in recent months since the Covid-19 pandemic rocked the world economical­ly and emotionall­y.
And saving jobs by deployment to new areas with skills training is one way the Government has been helping Singaporea­ns keep their livelihood.
Golf clubs in Singapore have also done their part by keeping their marshals, caddies and buggy bay helpers employable during this tough period.
Tanah Merah Country Club caddie Jumahat Ahmad is one such employee who has benefited from the club’s and its members’ generosity and benevolenc­e.
The 51-year-old has been working at TMCC for the last 33 years, a testament to his happiness with the club for having taken care of him all through the years.
“When I started working here, the Garden course had only nine-holes,” said Jumahat, who has been a caddie at TMCC since 1987 — five years after the club’s inaugurati­on.
He works to support his family and ageing mother who live with him in a five-room Housing Developmen­t Board flat in Bedok.
When golf courses closed on April 7 because of the Circuit Breaker measures, caddies like Jumahat were affected financiall­y because of loss of caddie fees, allowances and tips.
“I needed the job. Supporting my family and mum were my main concerns. And the bills were mounting,” he said.
As caddies are not compulsory in local golf clubs, they are often hired on a part-time basis, either when requested by golfers or to assist in operations during tournament days. As such, they do not draw a monthly salary and their income varies each month.
However, his concerns were eased thanks to the appeal by the club to members, who stepped forward to render financial assistance to the workhorses of the golf course.
On April 12, the general committee of TMCC appealed to their members for donations to their Caddie Welfare Fund — an existing fund that is in place for aspects such as caddie insurance and welfare.
So in April and May, 28 caddies received financial assistance in two cash payouts to tide them through the period before golf courses reo- GOLF CLUBS HELP STAFF KEEP THEIR JOBS lping d. lpers iod. addie loyee s nevo- TANAH MERAH MEMBERS STEP FURTHER BY RAISING FUNDS FOR CADDIES AMID THE PANDEMIC rking Caddie Jumahat Ahmad checks if all is well with the buggy. The remaining donations will be placed in the fund as a safety blanket for caddies, in the event that golf courses are closed once more due to the pandemic.
TMCC also prides in the fact that despite so much inactivity on the courses, it did not let off or retrench any staff.
So also Warren Golf and Country Club, which retained all its golf operations staff and helped them by applying for the Government’s Job Support Scheme.
“We have about a dozen marshals and buggy bay helpers, and they all remain employable,” said Warren general manager Jinder Aujla.
Marina Bay Golf Course (MBGC) also took steps to provide support to their affected staff.
While the public golf course saw a substantia­l drop in revenue, a spokesman said that the course did not resort to pay cuts or layoffs to ease the financial strain.
“We carried out regular staff engagement online to assure staff on continuous salary payment, and that there was no retrenchme­nt.” said the spokesman.
MBGC also secured temporary accommodat­ion for its Malaysian staff as they were unable to travel home due to the border lockdown.
With the added time, MBGC turned its attention to its staff, encouragin­g them to upgrade their skills and knowledge through online courses and cross-department training. TMCC caddie Jumahat Ahmad places a golf bag in the buggy. available to all their caddies.
“We didn’t know whether all our caddies were eligible for these relief schemes, but we knew that some of them came from families that relied on their income. Through the generosity of our members, we are glad to offer some relief,” he added. sisted caddies in applying for eligible relief schemes that were announced by the Government during the Circuit Breaker period.
The club’s director of golf, Ian Roberts, explained that even with the government relief schemes, the club wanted to ensure that assistance was pened on June 19.
“I’m very thankful for the committee and members in looking out for us, and supporting us through this difficult time,” beamed Jumahat.
In addition to the financial assistance from the Caddie Welfare Fund, Jumahat said that the club has as- SGA BOOST FOR JUNIOR GOLFERS ganising a special event for the kids.
The Junior Challenge, for boys and girls aged between seven and 12, is slated for Sept 11 at the Mandai course to be played on a stableford format.
About 50 players have entered for the event for a nine-hole afternoon competitio­n and the respective boys’ and girls’ champions will be honoured with a poster basically each to be put up at the Executive Course notice boards.
The SGA hopes to increase the frequency of this event —the first was staged in the beginning of the year — to alternate Fridays basically to keep the juniors engaged with the sport in practice and competitio­n.
The leading players will compete in the three-day SGA Junior Golf Challenge in November or December at the Sembawang Country Club.
The juniors aside, members of the National and Developmen­t squads have been busy with their high-performanc­e training under national coach Matt Ballard and High Perfor- BY GODFREY ROBERT Junior golf is alive and buzzing.
And much of the credit should go to the Singapore Golf Associatio­n for believing that the future of local golf is in their hands.
During a period when many junior events had to be postponed or cancelled for almost six months because of the imposition­s placed by the Covid-19 pandemic, the SGA has been keeping its young golfers active.
After encouragin­g the youngsters to keep themselves busy at the driving ranges – two that are busy are both public courses, namely Marina Bay Golf and Country Club and The Executive Course at Mandai – the SGA is or- mance Manager Joshua Ho at the Laguna National Golf and Country Club.
The training sessions resumed on an intensive basis following the online practice workouts during Phase Two of the Circuit Breaker.
There are 16 players in the National Squad and 14 members in the Developmen­t Squad.
Among the National Squad members James Leow, Nicklaus Chiam, Yoko Tai, Zachary Ong, Ashley Menne and Hailey Loh are in the United States while Wong Qi Wen (studying in North Carolina in the US) and Shannon Tan (studying in Queensland, Australia) are in Singapore. Why starting young in golf is important for these kids. BY JEREMY THESEIRA CHIPPING WITH EASE GIVING YOU SPEED AND DISTANCE While the Tour pros train tirelessly to dial in their game, most amateurs are simply out to enjoy a casual game.
Enter the new CBX Full-Face and Smart Sole 4, designed to make the game easier ever so slightly.
A new addition to their line-up, the CBX Full-Face sports a high toe profile with a half-cavity design near the heel that moves the CG forward, allowing the face to slide under the ball with ease.

Within the Tour Speed’s thermoplas­tic urethane (TPU) cover is a highspeed core formulatio­n wrapped with an ionomer casing layer that provides more distance off the tee without sacrificin­g greenside spin for more short game control.
The TPU exterior also sports a new 346 quadrilate­ral dipyramid dimple design that optimises aerodynami­cs to deliver a penetratin­g and consistent ball flight.
The Tour Speed was built on the research and testing of their experiment­al golf ball — the EXP•01 — which was an early prototype that was released late last year. different widths for each model.
