    <p>The launch of the Sin­ga­pore-Hong Kong air travel bub­ble will be de­ferred for two weeks, and the new launch date will be an­nounced later, Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The post­pone­ment came hours af­ter the au­thor­i­ties in the two cities had said ear­lier in the day that the in­au­gu­ral flights to­day would go ahead de­spite a spike in the num­ber of Covid-19 in­fec­tions in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post at around 5pm, Mr Ong said that he and Hong Kong Sec­re­tary for Com­merce and Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Ed­ward Yau agreed that it would be bet­ter to de­fer the launch, given the evolv­ing sit­u­a­tion in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>“We will re­view within two weeks on the new launch date and up­date again,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore-Hong Kong air travel bub­ble – the Repub­lic’s first since bor­der re­stric­tions were im­posed amid the Covid-19 pan­demic – was sup­posed to take off with one flight into each city with a max­i­mum ca­pac­ity of 200 pas­sen­gers on ev­ery flight.</p>
    <p>“I can fully un­der­stand the dis­ap­point­ment and frus­tra­tion of trav­ellers who have planned their trips. But we think it is bet­ter to de­fer from a pub­lic health stand­point,” Mr Ong said.</p>
    <p>“This is a sober re­minder that the Covid-19 virus is still with us, and even as we fight to re­gain our nor­mal lives, the jour­ney will be full of ups and downs. But we will press on and look for­ward to when we can safely launch the (air travel bub­ble),” he added.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong health au­thor­i­ties yes­ter­day re­ported 43 Covid-19 cases, 13 of which were un­linked.</p>
    <p>Un­der the terms of the ar­range­ment, travel will be sus­pended for two weeks if the seven-day mov­ing av­er­age of the daily num­ber of un­linked Covid-19 cases is more than five in ei­ther city. A two-day no­tice pe­riod will ap­ply be­fore the travel bub­ble is sus­pended.</p>
    <p>The un­linked cases in the territory yes­ter­day took the rolling seven-day av­er­age to 3.9. An­other nine un­linked cases to­day, which is likely to oc­cur, would see Hong Kong breach the thresh­old.</p>
    <p>Mr Yau said there was mu­tual agree­ment to de­lay the travel bub­ble plans by two weeks “for the Hong Kong (Covid-19) wave to set­tle a bit”, de­scrib­ing it as the re­spon­si­ble thing to do and also to ad­here to the con­di­tions set out in the deal.</p>
    <p>Re­tired bank­ing profession­al Tan Lay Hoon, 53, who was sup­posed to take the first bub­ble flight from Sin­ga­pore to see her hus­band who is based in Hong Kong now re­grets book­ing it.</p>
    <p>“I should have trav­elled two weeks ago with home quar­an­tine in­stead of wait­ing for this bub­ble flight,” she lamented. “Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) is only able to tell me that it is able to change my ticket at no charge, but there are no seats avail­able on the travel bub­ble flight up till Jan 31, 2021.”</p>
    <p>SIA and Cathay Pa­cific said cus­tomers may re­quest a full re­fund for their flights with can­cel­la­tion fees waived.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, SIA said it sup­ported the post­pone­ment. “The health and safety of our cus­tomers re­main our top pri­or­ity,” a spokesman said, adding that af­fected cus­tomers will be con­tacted.</p>
    <p>Cathay Pa­cific said pas­sen­gers can opt to resched­ule their flights at no cost.</p>
    <p>The Civil Avi­a­tion Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore yes­ter­day an­nounced that vis­i­tors ar­riv­ing from Hong Kong un­der the travel bub­ble will have to take a Covid-19 poly­merase chain re­ac­tion test upon ar­rival.</p>
    <p>With the sus­pen­sion of the travel bub­ble, Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens, per­ma­nent res­i­dents and long-term pass hold­ers can travel from Hong Kong to Sin­ga­pore on non-bub­ble flights. But they will have to serve a seven-day stay-home no­tice.</p>
    <p>Asia is brac­ing it­self for fur­ther in­creases in Covid-19 cases as many coun­tries in the re­gion, which had ini­tially tamped down on ris­ing in­fec­tions, are see­ing alarm­ing flare-ups.</p>
    <p>South Korea, Ja­pan, Malaysia, In­done­sia and In­dia are among the Asian coun­tries that are see­ing a resur­gence of the virus.</p>
    <p>This comes as cases reach 57.6 mil­lion world­wide, with deaths at 1.37 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga par­tially halted the Go To Travel do­mes­tic tourism cam­paign yes­ter­day as Covid-19 cases con­tin­ued to soar na­tion­wide.</p>
    <p>The abrupt U-turn just days af­ter say­ing the scheme would con­tinue as planned came as hos­pi­tals have be­gun to feel the strain from the ex­plo­sive growth in in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan had a fourth straight record-bust­ing day yes­ter­day with at least 2,560 cases, driven by new peaks in cities like Tokyo and Osaka, but clus­ters have also arisen in ru­ral re­gions that are far less equipped to deal with the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“We will tem­po­rar­ily stop tak­ing new reser­va­tions un­der the Go To Travel pro­gramme for des­ti­na­tions where in­fec­tions are on the rise,” Mr Suga said.</p>
    <p>But Tourism Min­is­ter Kazuyoshi Ak­aba said later that the finer de­tails – such as where the af­fected ar­eas are and when the sus­pen­sion will start – have yet to be worked out.</p>
    <p>The Go To Travel scheme gives sub­si­dies to trav­ellers with the aim of re­viv­ing the hos­pi­tal­ity in­dus­try. Un­der the scheme, up to 20,000 yen (S$260) of dis­counts are avail­able for an overnight stay.</p>
    <p>Dr Toshio Nak­a­gawa, who heads the Ja­pan Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion, and Dr Haruo Ozaki, who leads the Tokyo Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion, said the cam­paign had surely acted as a ve­hi­cle to spread the virus as it drives the move­ment of mil­lions across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The resur­gence in cases in the past week did noth­ing to stop mil­lions from go­ing on hol­i­day as the coun­try marked the start of a three-day-long week­end yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Flights and shinkansen bul­let trains were full, while traf­fic jams stretch­ing over as much as 26km were recorded on ma­jor ex­press­ways.</p>
    <p>Tourists cited the fact that their va­ca­tions had been planned months in ad­vance and that it would be a waste to in­cur can­cel­la­tion fees as rea­sons for go­ing ahead with their trips. Oth­ers said they would have thought twice about trav­el­ling had the govern­ment made the first step to sus­pend the Go To Travel scheme.</p>
    <p>A woman told TBS News be­fore she boarded the bul­let train bound for Mo­rioka in Iwate pre­fec­ture in north-east Ja­pan: “The fact that the cam­paign is still on­go­ing is tacit per­mis­sion that travel is OK.</p>
    <p>“Why can’t the govern­ment be more de­ci­sive?”</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s tally was driven by new peaks in ar­eas like Tokyo, where 539 cases marked the third straight day the city has logged more than 500 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>It was also the first day the Greater Tokyo re­gion, the world’s most pop­u­lated area, crossed a cu­mu­la­tive 1,000 cases.</p>
    <p>Chiba, east of Tokyo, set a new high of 109 cases, while Saitama to</p>
    <p>the north had a new peak of 173 in­fec­tions. Kana­gawa to the south recorded 193 new cases.</p>
    <p>Osaka in western Ja­pan had a third con­sec­u­tive record-break­ing day with 415 cases. Hyogo pre­fec­ture, where the city of Kobe is sit­u­ated, reg­is­tered a new peak of 153.</p>
    <p>Other ar­eas also saw high tal­lies. Aichi pre­fec­ture, where Nagoya is sit­u­ated, had 211 cases, while Hokkaido added 234 in­fec­tions, mostly in Sap­poro.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to sus­pend the Go To Travel scheme in hard-hit ar­eas came af­ter Dr Shigeru Omi, who heads a govern­ment panel of med­i­cal ex­perts, said on Fri­day: “Just re­ly­ing on the be­hav­iour of in­di­vid­u­als may not con­tinue to work, given the in­creas­ing num­ber of clus­ters in un­pre­dictable ar­eas, and the ris­ing num­bers of un­trace­able in­fec­tions.”</p>
