    <p>NEW YORK • A United States Navy plane crashed in a res­i­den­tial area in south­ern Alabama on Fri­day af­ter­noon, killing its two crew mem­bers, the mil­i­tary said.</p>
    <p>The plane went down next to a home near Fo­ley, Alabama, a coastal area about 48km south-east of Mo­bile, of­fi­cials said. No civil­ians on the ground were in­jured, the Bald­win County Sher­iff’s Of­fice said.</p>
    <p>The plane was a T-6B Texan II, the Navy said. This type of air­craft is of­ten used to train Navy and Marine Corps pi­lots, ac­cord­ing to the Navy’s web­site.</p>
    <p>The two pi­lots in the plane were an in­struc­tor and a stu­dent, said Com­man­der Zach Har­rell, a naval spokesman. The Navy said it would not re­lease the names of the pi­lots un­til 24 hours af­ter the next of kin had been no­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>The plane had de­parted from the Naval Air Sta­tion Whit­ing Field in Santa Rosa County, Florida, about 95km north-east of where it crashed, he said.</p>
    <p>The crash, which oc­curred around 4.20pm, sent de­bris to­wards a house, set­ting it ablaze, said Mr Joseph Darby, chief of the Fo­ley Fire Depart­ment. The two oc­cu­pants in the home at the time es­caped un­hurt, Mr Darby said.</p>
    <p>Two ve­hi­cles and the “re­main­ders of the plane” were de­stroyed in the fire, he said. Fire crews were able to ex­tin­guish the blaze quickly, he said, pre­vent­ing it from spread­ing to other homes.</p>
    <p>Mr James Far­ris, who lives across the street from the house that caught fire, said he saw the crash through the front win­dow of his home of­fice. He of­ten hears train­ing air­craft fly­ing over­head, he said, but the plane on Fri­day af­ter­noon was audi­bly fly­ing low.</p>
    <p>“It sounded like the Blue An­gels,” he said, re­fer­ring to the group of Navy jets that per­form ae­rial demon­stra­tions. “It was fly­ing re­ally low.”</p>
    <p>As Mr Far­ris was look­ing for the plane, he saw it dive nose-first into the ground.</p>
    <p>“At im­pact, it ex­ploded,” he said, adding that it shot a “big ball of flame” to­wards the house that caught fire. “When the fuel ex­ploded, it went for­ward into that house,” he said.</p>
    <p>The two peo­ple who es­caped from the house were a fa­ther and a daugh­ter, he said.</p>
    <p>The Depart­ment of De­fence is in­ves­ti­gat­ing the ac­ci­dent, the sher­iff’s of­fice said.</p>
