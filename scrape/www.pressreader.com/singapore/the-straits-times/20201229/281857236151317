    <p>The lat­est re­port pub­lished by the Bri­tish think­tank, the Cen­tre for Eco­nomics and Busi­ness Re­search (CEBR), fore­casts that the Chi­nese econ­omy will over­take that of the United States in 2028, five years ear­lier than ex­pected. This pro­jec­tion in its an­nual World Eco­nomic League Ta­ble is based largely on Bei­jing’s “skil­ful han­dling” of the Covid-19 pan­demic. CEBR also sees com­pre­hen­sive power steadily tilt­ing in China’s favour. This aside, In­dia push­ing Bri­tain down from fifth place in 2024 and pip­ping Ja­pan for the No. 3 spot in the early 2030s are other key fore­casts. While most of the re­port should not sur­prise those who watch global de­vel­op­ments un­fold, the im­proved fore­cast for China is par­tic­u­larly sig­nif­i­cant for Asia, and the world.</p>
    <p>China’s econ­omy over­took that of Ja­pan in nom­i­nal gross do­mes­tic prod­uct in 2010. Judged by pur­chas­ing power par­ity, the mea­sure used by many econ­o­mists, it al­ready is the No. 1 econ­omy, sur­pass­ing the US. While all this does not make China rich – at the end of the day the crit­i­cal num­ber for mea­sur­ing wealth is per capita in­come – ag­gre­gated eco­nomic heft does mat­ter and there is no gain­say­ing China’s steady rise to global em­i­nence in that re­gard. China is also mov­ing swiftly to ex­ceed tar­gets on is­sues such as climate mit­i­ga­tion. All this, and Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s rise and con­sol­i­da­tion of power, has re­quired ev­ery na­tion to redo its sums on the China ac­count.</p>
    <p>But it would be folly to think of China’s as­cent as a one-way street, or that Amer­ica’s yield­ing of pre-em­i­nence is in­evitable. De­spite the set­back from the Covid-19 pan­demic and the ob­vi­ous nar­row­ing of the gap with China thanks to the re­sult­ing eco­nomic hit it took, the US has al­ways had a tremen­dous ca­pac­ity to rein­vent it­self. With the vac­cines hav­ing ar­rived and the burst of in­no­va­tion that the pan­demic prompted, the econ­omy is poised for a smart re­bound. Ap­pli­ca­tions for patents have soared in the last half of 2020. World Bank data sug­gests that for all the pe­ri­odic eco­nomic crises and its dys­func­tional gover­nance, the US has main­tained its roughly 25 per cent share of global eco­nomic out­put since 1980.</p>
    <p>Yet, China’s share of global GDP has in­dis­putably in­creased, from 1.7 per cent four decades ago to about 16 per cent, while the rel­a­tive shares of Ja­pan, Ger­many and Bri­tain fell. This is re­order­ing the global strate­gic bal­ance. While the postWorld War II pass­ing of the global torch from Bri­tain to the US was ef­fected with­out much angst, China’s political sys­tem, as­sertive mil­i­tary and diplo­macy com­bine to make the loom­ing tran­si­tions in global power more fraught. Both sides of the equa­tion need to tread care­fully around this; the West and its al­lies need to find ways to ad­just to the sec­ond sun that has en­tered the global so­lar sys­tem. Equally, China needs to tem­per its ra­di­ance from glare to a glow.</p>
