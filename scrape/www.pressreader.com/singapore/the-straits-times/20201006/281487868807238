    <p>IN PLACE OF TRAVEL</p>
    <p>The Christ­mas light-up in Or­chard Road will be a scaled-down af­fair this year, with the usual street fes­tiv­i­ties called off ow­ing to the on­go­ing pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But or­gan­is­ers are still promis­ing a daz­zling spec­ta­cle when it kicks off on Nov 13, with a win­try dis­play of snowflakes, mistle­toe and hol­lies to set the shop­ping street aglow.</p>
    <p>This year’s light-up will fea­ture nearly 50km of LED string lights, up from 6km last year. The num­ber was cut last year as the fo­cus shifted to the pedes­trian ex­pe­ri­ence, with more lights on trees and lamp-post dec­o­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>With the scal­ing back of street ac­tiv­i­ties this year, the LED string lights will be re­stored to lev­els sim­i­lar to ear­lier years, the Or­chard Road Business As­so­ci­a­tion (Orba) told The Straits Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>For the first time, view­ers at home will be able to ex­pe­ri­ence “driv­ing” along the 2.9km stretch from Tan­glin Mall to Plaza Sin­ga­pura in a vir­tual tour fea­tur­ing 360de­gree views.</p>
    <p>The 14m main arch at the junc­tion of Or­chard Road and Pater­son Road will be adorned with a blue rib­bon and glit­ter­ing rein­deer, while lamp-post dec­o­ra­tions will fea­ture Christ­mas trees and white and gold baubles un­til Jan 1.</p>
    <p>The Great Christ­mas Vil­lage fair that typ­i­cally ac­com­pa­nies the light-up with food, amuse­ment rides, games and per­for­mances will not be re­turn­ing this year, how­ever.</p>
    <p>Orba said in a state­ment that the de­ci­sion was made to min­imise the risk of crowds gath­er­ing and to safe­guard pub­lic health and safety.</p>
    <p>In ded­i­cat­ing this year’s light-up to front-line work­ers, the as­so­ci­a­tion will be work­ing with ini­tia­tives such as Lions of Health­care to re­ward health­care staff, se­cu­rity guards, de­liv­ery staff and oth­ers with pro­mo­tions for shop­ping, din­ing and ser­vices. More in­for­ma­tion will be made avail­able on the Christ­mas on A Great Street mi­crosite next month, it said.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors to the mi­crosite can also nom­i­nate front-line he­roes by shar­ing their in­spir­ing sto­ries of re­silience, and get a chance to win prizes for them­selves as well as their he­roes.</p>
    <p>On how the bud­get for this year’s light-up com­pares with that in pre­vi­ous years, Orba de­clined to com­ment, cit­ing con­fi­den­tial­ity agree­ments. Orba chair­man Mark Shaw said the event aims to lift spir­its amid a chal­leng­ing year and lack of year-end travel for lo­cals.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, de­spite a l ack of tourists, who typ­i­cally make up about half of all vis­i­tors to Or­chard Road, foot­fall has been im­prov­ing steadily since shops were al­lowed to re­open in June, he said. “The num­bers are look­ing very en­cour­ag­ing... and (food and bev­er­age) es­tab­lish­ments seem to be mak­ing quite a strong come­back. We want to get peo­ple back into the re­tail shops.”</p>
    <p>There are plans for a Black Fri­day sale event to draw shop­pers, with de­tails to be an­nounced later.</p>
    <p>While the lack of street ac­tiv­i­ties may put a damper on the Christ­mas fes­tiv­i­ties, “we ex­pect peo­ple will still come to look at the lights, be­cause that’s usu­ally the main at­trac­tion any­way”, Mr Shaw added.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has made plans to re­ju­ve­nate Or­chard Road more ur­gent, he said, as more pedes­trian-friendly fea­tures and out­door ac­tiv­i­ties will give the street a boost.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, malls and re­tail­ers are re­tool­ing and re­think­ing the way they do business ow­ing to the new re­al­ity and long road to re­cov­ery ahead, Mr Shaw noted. “I think the fu­ture of Or­chard Road is se­cure, par­tic­u­larly if we go ahead and do this re­ju­ve­na­tion prop­erly.”</p>
    <p>Mr Amos Tan, a senior lec­turer at Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic’s School of Business, be­lieves the Christ­mas light-up is likely to draw more lo­cals than in pre­vi­ous years even with­out the street fair. “With the lim­i­ta­tion of not be­ing able to travel, many will go to Or­chard Road to soak in the fes­tive mood,” he said.</p>
    <p>This presents an op­por­tu­nity for re­tail­ers to grow their base of cus­tomers, which should take pri­or­ity over short-term prof­its, he added.</p>
    <p>Mrs Ann Ho, 42, an ad­min­is­tra­tive as­sis­tant, said that while she typ­i­cally avoids Or­chard Road dur­ing the hol­i­day sea­son be­cause of the large crowds, she may make an ex­cep­tion this year. “Since we can­not go overseas for hol­i­day, we might as well take the chil­dren out to see the Christ­mas lights,” she said.</p>
