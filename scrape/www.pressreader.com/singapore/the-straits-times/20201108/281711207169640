    <p>COPEN­HAGEN • Den­mark and the United States are among six coun­tries that have re­ported new coro­n­avirus cases linked to mink farms, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) said.</p>
    <p>Italy, the Nether­lands, Spain and Swe­den are the other na­tions to have dis­cov­ered Sars-CoV-2 i n minks, it added in a state­ment on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Den­mark has im­posed strict mea­sures in the north of the coun­try after warn­ing that a mu­ta­tion of the virus had jumped from minks to hu­mans and in­fected 12 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Copen­hagen has cau­tioned that the mu­ta­tion could threaten the ef­fec­tive­ness of any fu­ture Covid-19 vac­cine and or­dered the slaugh­ter of all the es­ti­mated 15 mil­lion to 17 mil­lion minks in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain yes­ter­day banned en­try to all non-res­i­dent for­eign­ers com­ing from Den­mark after the mu­ta­tion was found in hu­mans.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish trans­port depart­ment said the pro­hi­bi­tion will be re­viewed after one week.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists say virus mu­ta­tions are com­mon and of­ten harm­less, and that this one does not cause a more se­vere ill­ness in hu­mans.</p>
    <p>But the Dan­ish health au­thor­i­ties have ex­pressed con­cern that this strain, known as “Clus­ter 5”, is not in­hib­ited by an­ti­bod­ies to the same de­gree as the nor­mal virus, which they fear could threaten the</p>
    <p>ef­fi­cacy of vac­cines that are be­ing de­vel­oped across the globe.</p>
    <p>“Ini­tial ob­ser­va­tions sug­gest that the clin­i­cal pre­sen­ta­tion, sever­ity and trans­mis­sion among those in­fected are sim­i­lar to that of other</p>
    <p>cir­cu­lat­ing Sars-CoV-2 viruses,” the WHO state­ment said.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, this vari­ant... the ‘clus­ter 5’ vari­ant, had a com­bi­na­tion of mu­ta­tions, or changes that have not been pre­vi­ously ob­served.</p>
    <p>“The im­pli­ca­tions of the iden­ti­fied changes in this vari­ant are not yet well un­der­stood,” the UN agency warned.</p>
    <p>It added that pre­lim­i­nary find­ings in­di­cated this mink-as­so­ci­ated vari­ant has “mod­er­ately de­creased sen­si­tiv­ity to neu­tral­is­ing an­ti­bod­ies”.</p>
    <p>The WHO has called for fur­ther stud­ies to ver­ify the pre­lim­i­nary find­ings.</p>
    <p>“Al­though the virus is be­lieved to be an­ces­trally linked to bats, its ori­gin and in­ter­me­di­ate host(s) of Sars-CoV-2 have not yet been iden­ti­fied,” it noted.</p>
    <p>Since June, 214 hu­man cases of Covid-19 have been iden­ti­fied in Den­mark with vari­ants as­so­ci­ated with farmed minks, in­clud­ing 12 cases with a unique vari­ant that were re­ported last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 300,688 peo­ple have died from the coro­n­avirus in Europe, ac­cord­ing to a tally com­piled by Agence France-Presse on Fri­day. The re­gion is the sec­ond­worst af­fected by the pan­demic in terms of fa­tal­i­ties, after Latin Amer­ica and the Caribbean.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Liver­pool in Eng­land on Fri­day be­gan the coun­try’s first city-wide coro­n­avirus test­ing pro­gramme. All 500,000 res­i­dents will be of­fered re­peat tests, even if asymp­to­matic, un­der a pi­lot scheme that could be rolled out na­tion­wide if suc­cess­ful</p>
    <p>The surge in virus cases has forced Italy, France, Ire­land, Bri­tain and Greece to ei­ther im­pose re­stric­tions or a lock­down to con­tain the spread of the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Ini­tial ob­ser­va­tions sug­gest that the clin­i­cal pre­sen­ta­tion, sever­ity and trans­mis­sion among those in­fected are sim­i­lar to that of other cir­cu­lat­ing Sars-CoV-2 viruses... How­ever, this vari­ant... the ‘clus­ter 5’ vari­ant, had a com­bi­na­tion of mu­ta­tions, or changes that have not been pre­vi­ously ob­served. The im­pli­ca­tions of the iden­ti­fied changes in this vari­ant are not yet well un­der­stood.</p>
