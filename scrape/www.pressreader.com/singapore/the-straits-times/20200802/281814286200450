    <p>The po­lice are in­ves­ti­gat­ing the chief priest of Sin­ga­pore’s old­est Hindu tem­ple, the Sri Mari­amman Tem­ple, for an in­ci­dent in­volv­ing crim­i­nal breach of trust.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment re­leased last night, the tem­ple said a po­lice re­port was lodged re­gard­ing gold or­na­ments that went miss­ing in the cus­tody of its chief priest, Mr Si­vashri Kan­dasamy Se­na­p­athi.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries from The Sun­day Times, the po­lice con­firmed the re­port, and said that a 36-year-old man had been ar­rested for crim­i­nal breach of trust as a ser­vant.</p>
    <p>Po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing. The man is cur­rently on bail.</p>
    <p>Gold or­na­ments, which are fre­quently used for prayers, are kept in the cus­tody of the chief priest in the in­ner sanc­tum of the tem­ple, and reg­u­lar au­dits are done to en­sure that the or­na­ments are phys­i­cally ac­counted for, said the tem­ple in the state­ment.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing the last au­dit, it was dis­cov­ered (that) some gold or­na­ments were miss­ing. The chief priest was ques­tioned, and he sub­se­quently re­turned all miss­ing gold or­na­ments,” said the tem­ple, which is lo­cated along South Bridge Road in Chi­na­town.</p>
    <p>It added that fur­ther checks by the tem­ple com­mit­tee con­firmed that all gold or­na­ments were fully ac­counted for and no other per­son was in­volved in the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>“As it ap­peared that an of­fence (had) been com­mit­ted, a po­lice re­port was lodged not­with­stand­ing the fact that the tem­ple suf­fered no loss,” said the state­ment.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted, a tem­ple spokesman con­firmed the name of the chief priest.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he said the tem­ple was un­able to give more de­tails of the case, such as the dates of the in­ci­dent and the re­port, and fur­ther de­tails of the of­fence, as in­ves­ti­ga­tions were on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>The Sun­day Times un­der­stands that the in­ci­dent was dis­cov­ered on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The tem­ple com­mit­tee has kept the Hindu En­dow­ments Board in­formed of the in­ci­dent and they are work­ing closely to have clo­sure on this mat­ter, added the state­ment.</p>
    <p>Sri Mari­amman Tem­ple was con­structed in 1827 and is one of the main tem­ples for Hindu wor­ship­pers in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Before the Covid-19 pan­demic, it was a pop­u­lar tourist spot in Chi­na­town, and it is also home to the an­nual fire­walk­ing fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>The of­fence of crim­i­nal breach of trust hap­pens when a per­son dis­hon­estly mis­ap­pro­pri­ates, takes, uses or dis­poses of any prop­erty which he has con­trol over.</p>
