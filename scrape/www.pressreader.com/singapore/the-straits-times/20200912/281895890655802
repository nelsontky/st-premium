    <p>• Malaysia’s former fi­nance min­is­ter Lim Guan Eng has pleaded not guilty to two charges of dis­hon­est mis­ap­pro­pri­a­tion of prop­erty amount­ing to over RM200 mil­lion (S$66 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>Lim was charged yes­ter­day with dis­pos­ing of two prop­er­ties in the form of land to two firms linked to a con­tro­ver­sial un­der­sea tun­nel project.</p>
    <p>The charge was on the dis­hon­est mis­ap­pro­pri­a­tion of prop­erty lead­ing to the dis­posal of state land in Ban­dar Tan­jong Pi­nang, Pe­nang, worth RM135,086,094, to Ewein Zenith in Fe­bru­ary 2015. Lim was the chief min­is­ter at that time.</p>
    <p>He was also charged with dis­hon­est mis­ap­pro­pri­a­tion of prop­erty lead­ing to the dis­posal of another plot of state land in Ban­dar Tan­jong Pi­nang worth RM73,668,986 to Zenith Ur­ban De­vel­op­ment in March 2017.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Pe­nal Code, a per­son who dis­hon­estly mis­ap­pro­pri­ates, or con­verts to his own use, or causes any other per­son to dis­pose of, any prop­erty, faces a jail term of not less than six months and up to five years. The per­son also faces caning and a fine.</p>
    <p>Last month, Lim was slapped with mul­ti­ple charges.</p>
    <p>He was charged on Aug 7 with so­lic­it­ing a 10 per cent cut of prof­its from Con­sor­tium Zenith Con­struc­tion in March 2011 in ex­change for help­ing the firm se­cure the RM6.3 bil­lion Pe­nang un­der­sea tun­nel project.</p>
    <p>On Aug 10, he was charged with so­lic­it­ing a bribe of RM3.3 mil­lion from Con­sor­tium Zenith Con­struc­tion be­tween Jan­uary 2011 and Au­gust 2017 in ex­change for help­ing the firm to be ap­pointed as the builder of three roads re­lated to the un­der­sea tun­nel project.</p>
    <p>On Aug 11, Lim was charged – along with his wife Betty Chew and businesswo­man Phang Li Koon – with abus­ing his pub­lic of­fice for grat­i­fi­ca­tion when he was chief min­is­ter and Pe­nang De­vel­op­ment Cor­po­ra­tion chair­man be­tween Aug 19, 2013, and March 3, 2016. He pleaded not guilty to all charges.</p>
