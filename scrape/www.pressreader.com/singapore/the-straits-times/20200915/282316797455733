    <p>Sports fans here could be in for a “long ride” in their re­turn to a packed Na­tional Sta­dium if two “crit­i­cal un­cer­tain­ties” move in the wrong way as the world comes to terms with the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, said Sin­ga­pore Sports Hub chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Lionel Yeo.</p>
    <p>The two fac­tors are the pace of sci­en­tific de­vel­op­ment and state of in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion, said Yeo, who made the com­ments about the re­birth of the live sports and en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try dur­ing a panel dis­cus­sion yes­ter­day at the All That Mat­ters busi­ness fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>When asked about when he en­vi­sioned the 55,000-ca­pac­ity Na­tional Sta­dium be­ing full again, he said: “You need both ‘crit­i­cal un­cer­tain­ties’ to be work­ing in the same di­rec­tion, and in the right di­rec­tion, be­fore we can get back to 55,000 at the Na­tional Sta­dium.</p>
    <p>“So I’ m watch­ing that very closely. One with­out the other doesn’t quite work.</p>
    <p>“You (would) get a mid­dling sce­nario, where you mud­dle through, get stops and starts, some economies will open and then close down again.</p>
    <p>“And ob­vi­ously when you get those two crit­i­cal un­cer­tain­ties go­ing in the wrong di­rec­tion, then hang on, it’s go­ing to be a long ride.”</p>
    <p>Yeo, 47, who was chief of the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board from 2012 to 2018, i n Fe­bru­ary be­came the fourth man to helm the Sports Hub after French­man Philippe Collin</p>
    <p>Delavaud (March 2011-De­cem­ber 2015), and Sin­ga­pore­ans Manu Sawh­ney (Oc­to­ber 2015-May 2017) and Oon Jin Teik (Jan­uary 2018-April 2019).</p>
    <p>He added that the fu­ture of live sports and en­ter­tain­ment events at the Sports Hub is one that the $1.33 bil­lion facility needs to “co-cre­ate” to­gether with the live events in­dus­try and the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that there have been “a lot of be­hind-the-scenes dis­cus­sions” on a safe re­turn to live sports and en­ter­tain­ment, Yeo said: “There are dozens of re­open­ing plans and tem­plates that have been drawn up, dis­cussed, de­bated.</p>
    <p>“We have table­top ex­er­cises to talk through (them)... ‘Is this plan good enough? Will it in­spire confidence in the pub­lic?’</p>
    <p>“Will it be good enough to con­vince our health of­fi­cials that we will be able to re­spond should there be an out­break, for ex­am­ple, where we can do con­tact trac­ing with a rea­son­ably sized num­ber of peo­ple?”</p>
    <p>He also said that one sil­ver lin­ing to the dis­rup­tion caused by the Covid-19 out­break – at least seven ma­jor sports events have been axed in the last seven months – is that it has made event or­gan­is­ers “alive” to dig­i­tal en­gage­ment.</p>
    <p>“We will then emerge from this pan­demic with a much bet­ter play­book for en­gage­ment, and how we cre­ate mean­ing­ful ex­pe­ri­ences,” he added.</p>
    <p>Echo­ing Yeo’s view, Sport Sin­ga­pore chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Lim Teck Yin said that this in­no­va­tion and shift to­ward dig­i­tal en­gage­ment is part of a “re­siliency” that needs to take root in the sports in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing in a sep­a­rate All That Mat­ters panel dis­cus­sion that took place ear­lier, he said: “Let’s start to en­gen­der con­ver­sa­tions about greater creativity and in­no­va­tion in this space, and then pretty soon, the dy­nam­ics be­tween the dif­fer­ent stake­hold­ers in the in­dus­try will play out.</p>
    <p>“But I’m op­ti­mistic that, sport be­ing what it is, we’ll think about this for the longer term in terms of how we build greater re­siliency in the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause if this pan­demic is any­thing to go by, and all the com­men­ta­tors sug­gest that this is go­ing to (re­peat­edly) come and go, we have to make our shifts.”</p>
    <p>A LONG ROAD AHEAD</p>
    <p>There are dozens of re­open­ing plans... will it be good enough to con­vince our health of­fi­cials we will be able to re­spond should there be an out­break?</p>
