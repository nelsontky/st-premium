    <p>The elec­tion ex­penses of can­di­dates who con­tested the Gen­eral Elec­tion (GE) this year can be in­spected at the Elec­tions Depart­ment (ELD), start­ing to­day.</p>
    <p>They are avail­able for in­spec­tion for six months, un­til Feb 20 next year.</p>
    <p>A pay­ment of $2 is re­quired to in­spect each can­di­date’s re­turns.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, the ELD said that un­der the Par­lia­men­tary Elec­tions Act, the elec­tion agents of all can­di­dates must sub­mit a dec­la­ra­tion and a re­turn of elec­tion ex­penses to the Re­turn­ing Of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>They have to do it within 31 days after the day the GE re­sults are pub­lished in the Gazette, the ELD added in its state­ment.</p>
    <p>“These re­turns are re­quired to en­sure ac­count­abil­ity and trans­parency in the can­di­dates’ cam­paign fi­nance,” it said.</p>
    <p>The max­i­mum amount can­di­dates were al­lowed to spend on each voter in the July 10 elec­tion was $4.</p>
    <p>This year, tighter rules on elec­tion ad­ver­tis­ing meant that can­di­dates had to clearly state the amount spent on paid on­line ads when they sub­mit­ted their elec­tion ex­penses re­turns.</p>
    <p>The cost of re­mov­ing elec­tion ban­ners or posters in breach of the rules also counted to­wards each can­di­date’s elec­tion ex­penses.</p>
    <p>In the 2015 gen­eral elec­tion, Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) can­di­dates spent $5.3 mil­lion on the 89 seats the party con­tested, while the ex­penses of the eight op­po­si­tion par­ties con­test­ing the elec­tion to­talled $1.8 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>This worked out to an ex­pense of $2.16 per voter for the PAP, and for the op­po­si­tion par­ties, 73 cents.</p>
    <p>Apart from elec­tion posters and ban­ners, money has tra­di­tion­ally been spent on lo­gis­tics, such as the stage back­drops and tech­ni­cal equip­ment needed for ral­lies.</p>
    <p>In past elec­tions, can­di­dates also spent on food and re­fresh­ments for vol­un­teers, as well as on train­ing and con­sul­ta­tion for can­di­dates on how to man­age so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Those who wish to in­spect this year’s elec­tion ex­penses re­turns are re­quired to make an ap­point­ment with the ELD at least one work­ing day in ad­vance.</p>
    <p>They can e-mail ei­ther joyce_kow@eld.gov.sg or ng_hui_peng@eld.gov.sg</p>
