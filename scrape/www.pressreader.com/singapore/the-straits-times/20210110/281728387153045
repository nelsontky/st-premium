    <p>NEW DELHI • In­dian forces have de­tained a Chi­nese sol­dier on the dis­puted Hi­malayan fron­tier where the world’s two most pop­u­lous coun­tries fought a deadly bat­tle last year, the In­dian mil­i­tary said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It is the sec­ond de­ten­tion on the high-al­ti­tude bor­der since the pitched bat­tles last June, when 20 In­dian soldiers and an un­known num­ber of Chi­nese troops were killed.</p>
    <p>Both sides have since poured tens of thou­sands of troops and heavy weaponry into the ten­sion zone in the Ladakh re­gion, cur­rently in the grip of freez­ing win­ter tem­per­a­tures.</p>
    <p>The In­dian army said in a state­ment that the People’s Lib­er­a­tion Army (PLA) sol­dier was “ap­pre­hended” on the In­dian side of the Line of Ac­tual Con­trol (LAC), as the bor­der is known, in the early hours of Fri­day and taken into cus­tody.</p>
    <p>“The PLA sol­dier is be­ing dealt with as per laid­down pro­ce­dures, and cir­cum­stances un­der which he had crossed the LAC are be­ing in­ves­ti­gated,” the state­ment added.</p>
    <p>China has called for the swift re­turn of the sol­dier. China Mil­i­tary On­line, a news por­tal run by the mil­i­tary’s of­fi­cial PLA Daily news­pa­per, said the In­dian au­thor­i­ties should “promptly trans­fer” the sol­dier back to China and “jointly main­tain peace and tran­quil­lity in the bor­der area”.</p>
    <p>Another Chi­nese sol­dier was briefly held by In­dian forces in the same re­gion last Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>In­dia and China have dis­puted their fron­tier for seven decades and fought a brief war in 1962.</p>
    <p>The two sides blame each other for the cur­rent stand-off.</p>
    <p>The neigh­bours have held sev­eral rounds of dis­en­gage­ment talks, but failed to ease the mil­i­tary build-up.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s For­eign Min­istry said last Fri­day that the two sides have agreed to a new round of talks be­tween se­nior com­man­ders.</p>
