    <p>Get your fix of ten­don (tem­pura on rice) when the pop­u­lar Ja­panese chain Tem­pura Ten­don Tenya makes its de­but on Oct 15 at Or­chard Cen­tral.</p>
    <p>The brand is best known for its value-for-money rice bowls. At $8.50, its sig­na­ture Tenya Ten­don fea­tures tem­pura black tiger prawn, red fish, ten­der squid, Ja­panese pump­kin and French beans – driz­zled with a savoury glaz­ing sauce made of soya sauce and grilled eel essence. The Seafood Ten­don ($12.90) in­cludes anago (salt­wa­ter eel), scal­lop, tem­pura black tiger prawn, Ja­panese pump­kin and French beans.</p>
    <p>The menu also of­fers an ar­ray of ten­don or tem­pura served with ei­ther soba or udon (hot or cold, from $11.90). It also of­fers add-ons such as tori karaage ($4.90) and truf­fle fries ($3.90). For dessert, there is Hokkaido soft serve ($2), or a brownie slice with vanilla ice cream ($6.90).</p>
    <p>There are plenty of ten­don eater­ies in Sin­ga­pore. What sets Tenya apart – aside from its price – is its use of tech­nol­ogy to en­sure a con­sis­tent bowl of lightly bat­tered and crisp seafood and veg­eta­bles.</p>
    <p>In an ex­clu­sive pre­view for The Straits Times, Tenya Sin­ga­pore’s spokesman Bhakt Yap show­cased the restau­rant’s patented au­to­matic fryer which cooks the tem­pura in choles­terol-free canola oil. An in­frared heater en­ables the ma­chine to fry 1,000 pieces of tem­pura in an hour, with­out de­te­ri­o­ra­tion of the oil from con­tin­u­ous fry­ing.</p>
    <p>The kitchen also has pre­pro­grammed au­to­mated rice cook­ers and noo­dle boil­ers that cater to ef­fi­cient pre­ci­sion cook­ing for a high vol­ume of or­ders.</p>
    <p>Other nifty gad­gets help mon­i­tor the op­ti­mum tem­per­a­ture of the tem­pura bat­ter, as well as check on the vis­cos­ity of the glaz­ing sauce to en­sure qual­ity con­trol.</p>
    <p>In the din­ing area, an LED ceil­ing dis­play sets the mood, with ro­tat­ing, an­i­mated scenes of na­ture and kalei­do­scopic graph­ics. Dur­ing ser­vice, food is de­liv­ered to the ta­ble by sen­sor-nav­i­gated ro­bots.</p>
    <p>Es­tab­lished in 1989 in Asakusa, Tokyo, the tem­pura spe­cial­ist has grown its pres­ence to 226 stores across Ja­pan, as well as i n the Philip­pines, Thai­land, Tai­wan and Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>There are plans to ex­pand to heart­land lo­ca­tions in Sin­ga­pore, as well as Kuala Lumpur next year.</p>
    <p>Tenya’s en­trance into Sin­ga­pore is a fran­chise col­lab­o­ra­tion with Yotei Group Sin­ga­pore, which brought in Ja­panese chain Genki Sushi.</p>
    <p>On why they are open­ing Tenya here in this cur­rent cli­mate, Mr Yap says: “Don­buri has be­come in­creas­ingly pop­u­lar over the years and ac­cepted as an ev­ery­day meal. Like­wise, tem­pura has been well­re­ceived in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“If Tenya opened here 10 years ago, we would have faced a lot of chal­lenges, es­pe­cially with sup­ply, which, in turn, would have made our ten­don more ex­pen­sive. Now with the grow­ing pop­u­lar­ity of ten­don, there is a good sup­ply net­work and new tech­nolo­gies in place.”</p>
    <p>Tem­pura Ten­don Tenya opens on Oct 15 (11am to 10pm daily) at B1-01 Or­chard Cen­tral, 181 Or­chard Road.</p>
