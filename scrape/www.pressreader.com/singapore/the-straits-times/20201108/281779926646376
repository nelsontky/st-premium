    <p>• Staff at a fac­tory in north-west Eng­land run by en­gines maker Rolls-Royce have be­gun a three-week strike over the pos­si­ble re­lo­ca­tion of op­er­a­tions to Sin­ga­pore, the Bri­tish aero­space gi­ant con­firmed.</p>
    <p>The in­dus­trial ac­tion at the fa­cil­ity i n Barnoldswi­ck, Lan­cashire, started on Fri­day and is sched­uled to last un­til Nov 27, the Unite trade union said sep­a­rately.</p>
    <p>“We are work­ing hard to mit­i­gate any risk that this will have to our cus­tomers,” a Rolls spokesman told AFP on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The fa­cil­ity em­ploys 550 work­ers but 350 roles are at risk should Rolls-Royce move its fan-blade ac­tiv­i­ties to Asia.</p>
    <p>The group’s fi­nances have been rav­aged by plung­ing de­mand as the deadly Covid-19 pan­demic sparks an air trans­port cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“In May 2020, we an­nounced a ma­jor re­struc­ture of our busi­ness be­cause of the im­pact of the pan­demic on avi­a­tion,” the spokesman said.</p>
    <p>“We also an­nounced a strate­gic re­view of our global fa­cil­i­ties – and this (Barnoldswi­ck) pro­posal is part of that re­view.”</p>
    <p>Unite, Bri­tain’s big­gest trade union, slammed the plan as it de­fended the strike ac­tion.</p>
    <p>“The work­ers... are fight­ing to pre­serve the long-term vi­a­bil­ity of the site, fol­low­ing the de­ci­sion by Rolls-Royce to off­shore the pro­duc­tion of the man­u­fac­ture of its Trent j et en­gine blades to a fac­tory in Sin­ga­pore,” it said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“Unite be­lieves that this would make the fac­tory... po­ten­tially un­vi­able. The pro­posed loss of jobs, let alone the to­tal clo­sure of the site, would have a dev­as­tat­ing ef­fect on Barnoldswi­ck, where the com­pany re­mains the prin­ci­pal em­ployer.”</p>
    <p>Rolls-Royce stressed, how­ever, that it had not yet de­cided on the num­ber of job cuts and vowed the plant would re­main open.</p>
    <p>Un­der an over­haul an­nounced in May, Rolls-Royce is slash­ing 9,000 jobs, with more than half go­ing this year.</p>
    <p>Last month, it launched plans to shore up its fi­nances by up to £5 bil­lion (S$9.6 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>The com­pany, whose prod­ucts power Air­bus and Boe­ing air­craft, is strength­en­ing its bal­ance sheet to help it nav­i­gate the dam­ag­ing fall­out from the on­go­ing global health emer­gency that has grounded jets world­wide.</p>
