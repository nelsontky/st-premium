    <p>WASH­ING­TON • US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has con­demned protests in Port­land, Ore­gon, and vi­o­lence in “Demo­crat-run” cities as his Repub­li­can ad­min­is­tra­tion moves to in­ter­vene in ur­ban cen­tres that he says have l ost con­trol of an­tiracism demon­stra­tions.</p>
    <p>Fed­eral law en­force­ment of­fi­cers, armed with a new ex­ec­u­tive or­der aimed at pro­tect­ing mon­u­ments across the United States, last week started crack­ing down on crowds gath­er­ing in Port­land to protest against po­lice bru­tal­ity and sys­temic racism.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a chaotic night in Port­land that saw a po­lice as­so­ci­a­tion build­ing set on fire and of­fi­cers shoot­ing tear gas at a group of moth­ers protest­ing against po­lice bru­tal­ity, Mr Trump and Port­land’s mayor traded barbs over who was to blame for the es­ca­lat­ing un­rest.</p>
    <p>“We are try­ing to help Port­land, not hurt it. Their lead­er­ship has, for months, lost con­trol of the an­ar­chists and ag­i­ta­tors. They are miss­ing in ac­tion. We must pro­tect Fed­eral prop­erty, AND OUR PEO­PLE,” Mr Trump wrote in a Twit­ter post on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Fac­ing de­clin­ing polling num­bers ahead of the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion where he will be up against Demo­crat Joe Bi­den, Mr Trump is mak­ing “law and or­der” a cen­tral cam­paign is­sue to ap­peal to crit­i­cal sub­ur­ban vot­ers.</p>
    <p>The crack­down in the lib­eral bas­tion of Port­land drew wide­spread crit­i­cism and le­gal chal­lenges as videos sur­faced of cam­ou­flage-clad of­fi­cers with­out clear iden­ti­fi­ca­tion badges and rid­ing in un­marked ve­hi­cles us­ing force to ar­rest pro­test­ers with­out ex­pla­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Port­land Mayor Ted Wheeler said on Sun­day that it was the fed­eral author­i­ties who sharply es­ca­lated the sit­u­a­tion. “Their pres­ence here is ac­tu­ally lead­ing to more vi­o­lence and more van­dal­ism,” Mr Wheeler said on CNN’s State Of The Union pro­gramme. “And it’s not help­ing the sit­u­a­tion at all. They’re not wanted here. We haven’t asked them here.</p>
    <p>In fact, we want them to leave.”</p>
    <p>Mr Wheeler and Ore­gon Gov­er­nor Kate Brown, both Democrats, called the move an abuse of power by the fed­eral gov­ern­ment and the state filed a law­suit against the US agen­cies in­volved.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, Democrats in the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives de­manded in­ter­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions into whether the Jus­tice and Home­land Se­cu­rity de­part­ments had “abused emer­gency author­i­ties” in han­dling the Port­land protests.</p>
    <p>White House chief of staff Mark Mead­ows said At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Wil­liam Barr and Act­ing Home­land Se­cu­rity Sec­re­tary Chad Wolf are work­ing on mea­sures that the ad­min­is­tra­tion can take to counter the un­rest.</p>
    <p>“You’ll see some­thing rolled out this week as we start to go in and make sure that the com­mu­ni­ties, whether it’s Chicago or Port­land or Mil­wau­kee, or some­place across the heart­land of the coun­try, we need to make sure our com­mu­ni­ties are safe,” Mr Mead­ows said on Fox News’ Sun­day Morn­ing Fu­tures.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment is ex­pected to ex­pand a new Jus­tice De­part­ment ini­tia­tive that sends fed­eral law en­force­ment into cities fac­ing protests.</p>
    <p>In Port­land last Satur­day night, Ms Me­lanie Damm said she saw uniden­ti­fied fed­eral of­fi­cers in mil­i­tary-style gear fire tear gas can­is­ters into a group of moth­ers, clad mostly in white, who were protest­ing against po­lice bru­tal­ity.</p>
    <p>“The level of vi­o­lence es­ca­lated by th­ese GI sol­diers was such an over­re­ac­tion. You’re see­ing mums get­ting tear-gassed,” said Ms Damm, 39, who is a mother her­self. “We aren’t young and An­tifa-look­ing,” she added, re­fer­ring to more mil­i­tant anti-fas­cism pro­test­ers.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view on Fox News Sun­day, Mr Trump said of the in­crease in vi­o­lence in cities such as Chicago and New York that “they’re Demo­crat-run cities, they are lib­er­ally run. They are stupidly run”.</p>
