    <p>Voices of Sin­ga­pore is one of the first choirs to go on­line for vir­tual prac­tices amid the pan­demic. Since then, it has per­formed vir­tu­ally for sev­eral events, in­clud­ing ChildAid and the Pres­i­dent’s Star Char­ity con­certs. The choir has also been in­volved in med­i­cal re­search us­ing mu­sic.</p>
    <p>In be­tween pre­sen­ta­tions and school course­work, third-year univer­sity stu­dent Amir Mirza makes sure to find time to at­tend vir­tual choir prac­tices with the Voices of Sin­ga­pore (VOS) com­mu­nity cho­rus ev­ery Wed­nes­day evening.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) un­der­grad con­tin­ued singing with the choir even af­ter prac­tices were moved onto Zoom be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“It’s some­thing I look for­ward to ev­ery week. As a univer­sity stu­dent, things get re­ally hec­tic some­times. (The prac­tices) keep me sta­ble and grounded,” says the 24-year-old bass. “Be­sides the singing, there is also the so­cial part of be­ing con­nected with friends.”</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the ses­sions, mem­bers log on and sing alone, muted, while cho­rus lead­ers lead vo­cal warm-ups and score revision – a new ex­pe­ri­ence with “lim­i­ta­tions”, but worth­while, he says.</p>
    <p>“At the end of the day, it’s about the pas­sion for singing – it is a source of com­fort and so­lace for us, and some­thing we use to ex­press our sor­rows and grief in this crit­i­cal pe­riod. Even though it’s on­line, we share our voices to­gether.”</p>
    <p>Bet­ter known as the group that or­gan­ised the 900-strong vir­tual sin­ga­long of Dick Lee’s Home in April, VOS started out as an an­nual choral fes­ti­val – the VOS Choral Fes­ti­val – in 2015.</p>
    <p>Only in March last year was the VOS Choral So­ci­ety of­fi­cially formed and reg­is­tered as a non­profit arts or­gan­i­sa­tion, with five per­ma­nent cho­rus groups un­der it: the Chil­dren’s Choir, Ladies Choir, Com­mu­nity Cho­rus, VOS Singers and Coro­na­tion Singers.</p>
    <p>VOS founder and artistic di­rec­tor Dar­ius Lim, 34, be­lieves the choir is one of the first to go on­line and try vir­tual prac­tices. It hap­pened be­cause of a Covid-19 scare back in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>“One of our mem­bers had been ex­posed to a Covid-19 pa­tient from the Safra clus­ter,” he says, re­fer­ring to a clus­ter of Covid-19 in­fec­tions traced to a Chi­nese New Year gath­er­ing in Safra Jurong. “We freaked out, to say the least. So we can­celled the whole sea­son of con­certs and de­cided to vir­tu­alise ev­ery­thing.”</p>
    <p>Snow­balling sto­ries of fam­i­lies and friends sep­a­rated abroad be­cause of the pan­demic touched him: “We thought, what if we have a vir­tual mu­si­cal plat­form where we can unite fam­i­lies? Al­though they’re not phys­i­cally to­gether, it’d give them some sense of com­fort.”</p>
    <p>The Home video gar­nered over 226,000 views on Face­book and sparked a na­tion­wide sin­ga­long.</p>
    <p>Cho­rus mem­bers have been kept busy since. In June, the chil­dren’s choir pre­sented a mi­grant worker vir­tual choir project A World To­gether, in part­ner­ship with lo­cal char­ity Health­serve.</p>
    <p>In July, there was a singing project with Unicef, fund-rais­ing con­cert ChildAid, and the VOS Choral Fes­ti­val that fea­tured other lo­cal choirs. Most re­cently, the en­tire choral so­ci­ety sang in the Pres­i­dent’s Star Char­ity con­cert yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Any­one can join the com­mu­nity cho­rus, which has no au­di­tions. Mem­bers range from 18 years old to 80 and come from all walks of life, says Mr Lim. In fact, in­ter­est in the com­mu­nity cho­rus has sky­rock­eted in the past six months, with the full strength hav­ing tripled from 48 to 165.</p>
    <p>Some are even based overseas and call into the weekly vir­tual prac­tices at odd hours of the night.</p>
    <p>“I think a lot of the mo­ti­va­tion comes from rid­ing off the in­ter­ac­tions and one an­other’s en­ergy,” Mr Lim says. “We may be on Zoom, but it’s not just me talk­ing – the chat bar on the side is con­stantly ring­ing with peo­ple ask­ing ques­tions. It’s a very interactiv­e thing.”</p>
    <p>Val Chong, who sings in the chil­dren’s choir, be­lieves singing with VOS helped her men­tal health and well­ness dur­ing this time. “The cir­cuit breaker pe­riod was chal­leng­ing for me as I felt dis­con­nected and iso­lated from the rest of the com­mu­nity. I missed the phys­i­cal in­ter­ac­tion of per­form­ing to­gether in a choir,” says the 17-year-old School of the Arts Sin­ga­pore stu­dent.</p>
    <p>“But the weekly prac­tice ses­sions made me re­alise the power of mu­sic as a cre­ative plat­form. We had fun games and ac­tiv­i­ties that bonded us, and our con­duc­tor Mr Dar­ius would al­ways check in on our well­be­ing and men­tal state. I am proud to call the choir my sec­ond home.”</p>
    <p>HEAL­ING WITH SONG</p>
    <p>Be­sides such com­mu­nity projects, VOS has also been an ad­vo­cate of us­ing mu­sic to fur­ther med­i­cal re­search here.</p>
    <p>Since 2015, Mr Lim has been run­ning a de­men­tia preven­tion re­search choir in part­ner­ship with Jurong Town Coun­cil and the NUS.</p>
    <p>To de­ter­mine if singing in a choir can pre­vent de­men­tia, senior vol­un­teers were given choral train­ing once a week. Ev­ery few months, they took MRI scans to in­ves­ti­gate the ef­fi­cacy of choral singing on their emo­tional and men­tal health, says Mr Lim. NUS pi­loted the re­search, while he led the mu­sic plan­ning – which VOS took over last year. The ini­tia­tive has been put on pause in­def­i­nitely since Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>VOS also started a mu­sic-mak­ing pro­gramme for chil­dren with spe­cial needs last month. Sup­ported by Te­masek Trust, the free 10-week-long pro­gramme takes place en­tirely over Zoom.</p>
    <p>The pre-recorded ses­sions show two con­duc­tors, trained in spe­cial needs education, singing and us­ing props and vis­ual aids. Chil­dren get to learn rhythms and songs, and sing in other lan­guages.</p>
    <p>“The pro­gramme is very phys­i­cal – there is a lot of kines­thetic move­ments; tap­ping of the shoul­ders and feet. It’s mu­sic-mak­ing just for fun, with no em­pha­sis on choral ex­cel­lence,” says Mr Lim.</p>
    <p>Re­sponse has been ro­bust, with more than 60 sign-ups from both within and out­side the spe­cial needs com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>And soon, higher-func­tion­ing in­di­vid­u­als “want­ing a chal­lenge” will be able to get their fix too. VOS will pi­lot a spe­cial needs cham­ber choir in Jan­uary, called Starlight Voices. “It will cater to the high­er­func­tion­ing in­di­vid­u­als who are look­ing for greater chal­lenges in mu­sic, where they can sing in parts and do se­ri­ous choral work,” Mr Lim says.</p>
    <p>In the next six months, he also plans to start cor­po­rate choirs – a “huge thing” in coun­tries like Wales where he did his post­grad­u­ate stud­ies. Such cor­po­rate recre­ational ac­tiv­i­ties have been proven to build friend­ship and work­place har­mony, and im­prove the work-life en­vi­ron­ment, he says.</p>
    <p>“We ul­ti­mately want to bring singing to of­fices be­cause that’s where the high­est stress lev­els are.”</p>
    <p>On his pas­sion for such projects, he says his aim is sim­ply to bring choral mu­sic to the masses, and ad­vo­cate that “ev­ery­one can sing”.</p>
    <p>Grow­ing up, he found the choral scene ex­clu­sive, with its main au­di­ence be­ing friends and fam­ily of those per­form­ing.</p>
    <p>Life-chang­ing ex­pe­ri­ences watch­ing the Na­tional Day Pa­rade re­hearsal in Pri­mary Five, and at a rugby match in Wales, also made him re­alise the im­por­tance of com­mu­nity spirit in cul­ture-build­ing.</p>
    <p>“There were 60,000 men in the sta­dium cheer­ing, and they spon­ta­neously broke out into song, singing their Welsh songs,” he re­calls. “There was no stigma in male singing, and ev­ery­one was just so proud of where they come from.</p>
    <p>“Ex­pe­ri­ences like these re­ally helped me to feel we are build­ing some­thing big­ger than our­selves. That’s what I feel most pas­sion­ate about – giv­ing peo­ple re­newed pur­pose through mu­sic.”</p>
