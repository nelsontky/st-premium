    <p>The news of Bangladesh na­tion­als be­ing picked up dur­ing a re­cent se­cu­rity crack­down in Sin­ga­pore has caused their coun­try­men here to worry that it may lead to dis­crim­i­na­tion against them.</p>
    <p>Mr Ab­dul Khaeer Mo­hammed Mohsin, ed­i­tor of Banglar Kan­tha, a Ben­gali news­pa­per here, yes­ter­day said Bangladesh­is in Sin­ga­pore were “very sad” on hear­ing the news.</p>
    <p>“Last night I met some of our coun­try­men. They said very few were in­volved, so why should they suf­fer and be blamed as if they are also in­volved just be­cause they are Bangladesh­i?”</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Home Af­fairs (MHA) had an­nounced on Tues­day that 37 peo­ple had been in­ves­ti­gated in the wake of ter­ror at­tacks in France and else­where.</p>
    <p>Among them were 15 Bangladesh­is who had made so­cial me­dia posts in­cit­ing vi­o­lence and com­mu­nal un­rest.</p>
    <p>A 26-year-old Bangladesh­i con­struc­tion worker, Ahmed Faysal, was also de­tained un­der the In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity Act for ter­ror-re­lated ac­tiv­i­ties, the MHA said.</p>
    <p>Mr Sahidul Is­lam, an ad­min­is­tra­tive as­sis­tant in the mar­itime sec­tor, said he was at a loss as to how Faysal could find the time for his ac­tiv­i­ties. Bangladesh­is choose to work here to earn higher in­comes, so they are fo­cused on their jobs, and the last thing on their minds is pol­i­tics, he added.</p>
    <p>“We are all so busy ev­ery day. How he man­aged to do that (get rad­i­calised), I also don’t un­der­stand,” said the 44-year-old who came to work here in 2008.</p>
    <p>Also, his com­pany of­ten re­minds them not to share things on so­cial me­dia that may breach the law.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Bangladesh So­ci­ety has con­demned the ac­tions of those nabbed and said it strongly sup­ports the Gov­ern­ment’s firm ac­tion to up­hold na­tional se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Its spokesman fur­ther said the so­ci­ety “sees this as an iso­lated and un­for­tu­nate in­ci­dent”, and sup­ports “any ac­tion that is vi­tal to elim­i­nate rad­i­cal­ism and pro­mote sec­u­lar­ism”.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam had said that while there is con­cern about for­eign­ers us­ing Sin­ga­pore as a base for ag­i­tat­ing vi­o­lence abroad, “we ought not be look­ing at ev­ery mi­grant worker as a po­ten­tial ter­ror­ist”.</p>
    <p>Mr Mohsin said that fol­low­ing the at­tacks in France, his news­pa­per had pub­lished an edi­to­rial call­ing on Bangladesh­is here not to write so­cial me­dia posts that in­cite vi­o­lence or com­mu­nal un­rest, or to get in­volved in re­li­gious or po­lit­i­cal con­tro­ver­sies.</p>
    <p>This was also echoed in his meet­ing with the Bangladesh High Com­mis­sion here, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Mohsin also blamed the Covid-19 pan­demic, say­ing it has caused most of the work­ers to be con­fined to their dor­mi­to­ries in their free time, “so they end up surf­ing so­cial me­dia as there is noth­ing much else to do”.</p>
    <p>He added that this leaves them ex­posed to rad­i­cal pro­pa­ganda.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Bangladesh So­ci­ety spokesman said it also works with the Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore to pro­mote re­li­gious har­mony and counter rad­i­cal re­li­gious teach­ings.</p>
