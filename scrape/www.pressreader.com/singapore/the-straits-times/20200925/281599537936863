    <p>With more coun­tries and firms pay­ing at­ten­tion to cli­mate change and sus­tain­abil­ity, there may be op­por­tu­ni­ties to be reaped in pro­vid­ing car­bon ser­vices – an area Sin­ga­pore is study­ing. En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore and the Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Board re­cently called a ten­der for a study to see how Sin­ga­pore can be de­vel­oped as a car­bon ser­vices hub.</p>
    <p>With more na­tions and com­pa­nies pay­ing at­ten­tion to cli­mate change and sus­tain­abil­ity, there may be eco­nomic op­por­tu­ni­ties to be reaped in pro­vid­ing car­bon ser­vices – an area that Sin­ga­pore is study­ing.</p>
    <p>En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG) and the Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Board (EDB) re­cently called a ten­der for a study to see how Sin­ga­pore can be de­vel­oped as a car­bon ser­vice hub.</p>
    <p>“The in­creased fo­cus on cli­mate change and sus­tain­abil­ity and the im­ple­men­ta­tion of var­i­ous in­ter­na­tional agree­ments lim­it­ing the growth of car­bon emis­sions will re­sult in an in­crease in de­mand for car­bon cred­its and re­lated car­bon ser­vices,” said the agen­cies in the ten­der doc­u­ment seen by The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Among other things, the study seeks to iden­tify, as­sess and quan­tify eco­nomic op­por­tu­ni­ties aris­ing from the growth of car­bon mar­kets glob­ally, and de­ter­mine which ar­eas are most rel­e­vant to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>As the two gov­ern­ment agen­cies in charge of eco­nomic and en­ter­prise devel­op­ment, EDB and ESG said they are con­tin­u­ally on the look­out for new op­por­tu­ni­ties that will add value to the econ­omy and cre­ate good jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Car­bon ser­vices have been iden­ti­fied as a po­ten­tial growth area, they told ST.</p>
    <p>“The pur­pose of the ten­der is to sup­port these ef­forts as we seek ad­vice from con­sul­tants who are able to help us study this op­por­tu­nity fur­ther,” said their joint state­ment, which was signed by the EDB’s vice-pres­i­dent for en­vi­ron­men­tal sus­tain­abil­ity Ade­line Aw, and the ESG’s direc­tor for trade and busi­ness ser­vices Ivan Tan.</p>
    <p>“This is part of Sin­ga­pore’s over­all ef­forts to pro­mote green growth, ride on op­por­tu­ni­ties from de­car­bon­i­sa­tion and grow green in­dus­tries.”</p>
    <p>Mr San­deep Cham­ling Rai, se­nior ad­viser for global cli­mate adap­ta­tion pol­icy at the World Wide Fund for Na­ture Sin­ga­pore, said there are three main types of car­bon ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The first in­volves the es­tab­lish­ment of car­bon off­set projects, which could in­clude re­for­esta­tion projects or the re­place­ment of coal plants with re­new­able en­ergy sources.</p>
    <p>The main goal of such projects is to ei­ther cap­ture car­bon diox­ide or pre­vent the emis­sion of the heat-trap­ping gas into the at­mos­phere. Com­pa­nies are usu­ally set up to un­der­take these projects, added Mr San­deep.</p>
    <p>An­other type of car­bon ser­vice, he said, is the val­i­da­tion of car­bon off­set projects.</p>
    <p>Said Mr San­deep: “A project needs to be val­i­dated by cer­ti­fied val­ida­tors, sim­i­lar to ISO cer­ti­fiers, that will cal­cu­late the ex­act amount of (emis­sions) gen­er­ated in a year.”</p>
    <p>Such val­i­da­tion is im­por­tant as it es­tab­lishes the ba­sis for the cal­cu­la­tion of car­bon cred­its, which are used in car­bon trad­ing – the third type of car­bon ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Car­bon trad­ing es­sen­tially treats car­bon as a com­mod­ity.</p>
    <p>“Com­pa­nies or gov­ern­ments can choose to buy car­bon cred­its to off­set their car­bon foot­print or to reach their emis­sions mit­i­ga­tion tar­get through car­bon off­sets,” said Mr San­deep.</p>
    <p>Mr Eric Bea, an en­vi­ron­men­tal law re­searcher at the Na­tional University of Sin­ga­pore, said Sin­ga­pore is in a good po­si­tion to es­tab­lish it­self as a hub for car­bon ser­vices, con­sid­er­ing its close ties with coun­tries in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>It is not yet clear if es­tab­lish­ing a car­bon ser­vice hub would help to re­duce Sin­ga­pore’s own car­bon foot­print.</p>
    <p>Mr Bea said t hat glob­ally, putting a price on car­bon would make com­pa­nies and coun­tries more conscious about the emis­sions they pro­duce.</p>
    <p>“But un­less Sin­ga­pore chooses to be a buyer as well, it doesn’t make a dif­fer­ence since the en­vi­ron­men­tal goods are not made here,” he said, re­fer­ring to goods such as car­bon off­set­ting projects.</p>
    <p>Mr San­deep noted that ul­ti­mately, in­vest­ing in car­bon cred­its is just a com­ple­men­tary strat­egy to other emis­sions-re­duc­tion pro­grammes, he said.</p>
    <p>“Gov­ern­ments and busi­nesses should first work to­wards re­duc­ing their di­rect car­bon emis­sions, and turn to car­bon off­set­ting only if there are no fur­ther do­mes­tic mea­sures avail­able.”</p>
