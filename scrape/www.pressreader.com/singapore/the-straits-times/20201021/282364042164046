    <p>We are there for him, he knows that and we will wait for him like a good wife is wait­ing when the hus­band is in jail.</p>
    <p>LON­DON • Liver­pool man­ager Jur­gen Klopp is con­fi­dent de­fender Vir­gil van Dijk will come back stronger as the Dutch­man un­der­goes knee surgery and faces a bat­tle to play again this sea­son.</p>
    <p>The Premier League cham­pi­ons said on Sun­day that van Dijk, 29, has dam­aged knee lig­a­ments fol­low­ing a chal­lenge by Ever­ton goal­keeper Jor­dan Pick­ford dur­ing Satur­day’s 2-2 Mersey­side derby draw at Good­i­son Park.</p>
    <p>His knee op­er­a­tion has yet to be sched­uled and Klopp did not put a timescale on the re­turn of the cen­tre back, whose run of start­ing the last 94 Premier League games will now come to an end.</p>
    <p>“A few things are clear... he now will be out for a while,” Klopp told Liver­pool’s web­site. “I ex­pected it pretty much on Satur­day af­ter the game im­me­di­ately, es­pe­cially when I saw the chal­lenge back.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese sit­u­a­tions are ab­so­lutely rub­bish. “You don’t need it but you have to get over it and Vir­gil will get over it, 100 per cent, and today is al­ready the first day, if you want, of the re­cov­ery. We are in con­tact.</p>
    <p>“We are there for him, he knows that and we will wait for him like a good wife is wait­ing when the hus­band is in jail.”</p>
    <p>Pick­ford will not face ret­ro­spec­tive ac­tion over his chal­lenge af­ter the Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion de­ter­mined the in­ci­dent was seen at the time by the match of­fi­cials, in­clud­ing VAR(video as­sis­tant ref­eree).</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Liver­pool cap­tain Jor­dan Henderson wants the team to use van Dijk’s ab­sence as an added in­cen­tive to stay in the tro­phy hunt.</p>
    <p>“It’s a tough one. It’s a big blow for us,” Henderson said. “For him per­son­ally, ob­vi­ously. But for us as a team, a mas­sive blow. I’m just gut­ted for him. It’s a dif­fi­cult mo­ment, but that’s when you need to be there for each other.”</p>
    <p>The skip­per said it was up to the team to “win as many games as we can for him”.</p>
    <p>“That’s down to us to make sure that when he is back and he is fit that we’re still fight­ing to be suc­cess­ful and fight­ing for tro­phies.”</p>
    <p>Klopp also said mid­fielder Naby</p>
    <p>Keita could fea­ture in today’s Cham­pi­ons League Group D match at Ajax Am­s­ter­dam af­ter he re­sumed train­ing fol­low­ing a neg­a­tive Covid-19 re­sult. The 25-year-old had tested pos­i­tive for the virus while on in­ter­na­tional duty with Guinea last week.</p>
    <p>Thi­ago Al­can­tara will also un­dergo a fit­ness test for a knock sus­tained dur­ing the derby.</p>
