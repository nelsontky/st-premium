    <p>Dr R. Theyven­dran, former sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the Man­age­ment De­vel­op­ment In­sti­tute of Sin­ga­pore (MDIS) and a vet­eran com­mu­nity leader, died on Tues­day at the age of 79.</p>
    <p>His cre­ma­tion took place yes­ter­day, and he is sur­vived by his wife and son.</p>
    <p>Dr Theyven­dran, who was fondly known as De­nan, was also ac­tive in var­i­ous com­mu­nity or­gan­i­sa­tions, in­clud­ing as chair­man of Tamils Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Council (TRC), an um­brella body of about 30 Tamil or­gan­i­sa­tions in Sin­ga­pore, and the Sin­ga­pore In­dian Cham­ber of Com­merce and In­dus­try (SICCI).</p>
    <p>“He took TRC to new heights. Many new ini­tia­tives were es­tab­lished dur­ing his ten­ure, most no­tably bur­saries for stu­dents,” said TRC chair­man V. Pandiyan, 58.</p>
    <p>“A man with a good heart, he never said no to any­one who ap­proached him. He al­ways lent a help­ing hand, whether mon­e­tary or oth­er­wise to many or­gan­i­sa­tions and in­di­vid­u­als,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Pandiyan said Dr Theyven­dran’s pass­ing is a loss to Tamil or­gan­i­sa­tions and the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Dr Theyven­dran, who is of Sri Lankan an­ces­try, also helmed the Cey­lon Sports Club and the Sin­ga­pore Cey­lon Tamils’ As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr M. Luk­shu­mayeh, pres­i­dent of Cey­lon Sports Club, said: “He was a gi­ant of a man. His heart and soul was for oth­ers and his vi­sion was to see as many peo­ple come up in life. I will cer­tainly not see some­body like him in my lifetime.”</p>
    <p>Cey­lon Sports Club and the In­dian As­so­ci­a­tion, which are neigh­bours in Balestier Road, were sched­uled to ob­serve a minute of si­lence, with their lights off, as a mark of re­spect last night.</p>
    <p>“It is a mo­ment for us to come to­gether to cel­e­brate the life of this ex­tra­or­di­nary man who has pos­i­tively im­pacted our lives and whose achieve­ments and legacy will live on,” said Mr Luk­shu­mayeh.</p>
    <p>Among Dr Theyven­dran’s other no­table con­tri­bu­tions were as chair­man of the Tele­coms Credit Co-op­er­a­tive, se­cond deputy chair­man of the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Co­op­er­a­tive Fed­er­a­tion, project chair­man of the re­build­ing of Sri Sen­paga Vi­naya­gar Tem­ple in Cey­lon Road, ad­viser to Sem­bawang Tamils As­so­ci­a­tion and chair­man of the Se­cureGuard Se­cu­rity Ser­vices co-op­er­a­tive.</p>
    <p>He was also a trustee of the Print and Me­dia As­so­ci­a­tion, Sin­ga­pore, the na­tional rep­re­sen­ta­tive body for the print­ing in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The vet­eran busi­ness­man had a rep­u­ta­tion for turn­ing trou­bled or­gan­i­sa­tions around, and af­ter join­ing loss-mak­ing print­ing com­pany Stam­ford Press in 1983, grew it into Stam­ford Me­dia In­ter­na­tional in 2001. The com­pany was named one of the top 50 En­ter­prise Com­pa­nies in 1996 and in 2000, and ven­tured into ar­eas such as e-com­merce, soft­ware de­vel­op­ment and tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Dr Theyven­dran was a member of the MDIS gov­ern­ing council from 1989 to 2020, where he had “con­trib­uted im­mensely to the growth of MDIS”, the not-for­profit pri­vate ed­u­ca­tion in­sti­tu­tion said in an obit­u­ary on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>When he joined, it had been mak­ing losses of about $60,000 a year. Within three years, he turned it around and it ran a sur­plus of more than $1 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>“Which­ever roles and re­spon­si­bil­i­ties he un­der­took, he was very fo­cused and did it ex­traor­di­nar­ily well,” said Dr T. Chan­droo, chair­man of SICCI who served as vicechair­man when Dr Theyven­dran was chair­ing the as­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“His en­ergy and en­thu­si­asm would last through the en­tirety of the task he em­barked on and I had never seen lethargy in him. His style of lead­er­ship had al­ways mes­merised me,” he said.</p>
