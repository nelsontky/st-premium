    <p>• Aus­tralia’s Vic­to­ria state will send in the army to ques­tion peo­ple who have tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, as it bat­tles to con­trol an out­break that claimed a record num­ber of lives yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s sec­ond-most pop­u­lous state will de­ploy Aus­tralian De­fence Force per­son­nel to the homes of peo­ple who have tested pos­i­tive and who have not an­swered tele­phone calls, in or­der to kick-start the con­tact trac­ing process, state Premier Daniel An­drews said.</p>
    <p>A flare-up of in­fec­tions in Melbourne, the state’s largest city, prompted the gov­ern­ment to en­force a six-week par­tial lock­down and make face masks manda­tory for its res­i­dents or risk a A$200 (S$196) fine.</p>
    <p>“This is about go­ing that ex­tra step to make sure that we can­not just call but we can con­nect... get that in­ter­view done and then be­gin the process of trac­ing con­tacts,” Mr An­drews told a reg­u­lar press con­fer­ence. “If you were door knocked and you were not found at home... that would al­most cer­tainly lead to you be­ing fined.”</p>
    <p>The state recorded six deaths overnight, the high­est daily toll for the na­tion since the pan­demic be­gan. All the deaths were linked to aged care homes, of which more than 40 have recorded out­breaks.</p>
    <p>Statewide, 300 new in­fec­tions were found, drop­ping from a record of 484 on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Two cases were de­tected among Abo­rig­i­nal peo­ple in the re­gional Vic­to­rian city of Bal­larat, a cause for con­cern for of­fi­cials, given a high de­gree of health is­sues among indige­nous Aus­tralians.</p>
    <p>“No one should be mov­ing to­wards try­ing to pro­vide de­fin­i­tive com­men­tary that we have turned a cor­ner,” Mr An­drews added.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has so far es­caped the high Covid-19 ca­su­alty num­bers of other na­tions, with just over 13,500 in­fec­tions and 139 deaths from the virus as of yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In the most pop­u­lous state of New South Wales, re­stric­tions were rein­tro­duced yes­ter­day af­ter sev­eral clus­ters emerged, in­clud­ing dozens of cases stem­ming from a Thai restau­rant.</p>
    <p>New cases in the state fell to seven overnight, from sev­eral days in the tens.</p>
    <p>Group book­ings at restau­rants, cafes and clubs will be lim­ited to 10 peo­ple, and pa­trons in­side a venue will be capped at 300.</p>
    <p>Wed­dings and cor­po­rate events will be lim­ited to 150 peo­ple, with strict so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules, in­clud­ing a ban on singing, danc­ing and min­gling, while only 100 can at­tend funer­als and places of wor­ship.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s na­tional Cabi­net met yes­ter­day and laid out new mea­sures to combat the virus, in­clud­ing tougher re­stric­tions on truck drivers trans­port­ing goods be­tween states, some of which have not seen any cases of com­mu­nity transmissi­on for months.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son reaf­firmed the coun­try’s ag­gres­sive sup­pres­sion strat­egy to stamp out all com­mu­nity transmissi­on, even as it looks to soften the eco­nomic blow. Aus­tralia’s bud­get is set to plunge to its big­gest deficit since World War II this year as the coro­n­avirus cri­sis knocks the coun­try into its first re­ces­sion in three decades and forces pol­i­cy­mak­ers to roll out hun­dreds of bil­lions of dol­lars in stim­u­lus.</p>
    <p>Mean­time, the south­ern is­land state of Tas­ma­nia will next month be­gin ac­cept­ing tourists from other ar­eas of the coun­try that have seen sig­nif­i­cant pe­ri­ods with no fresh cases of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>State of­fi­cials said yes­ter­day that Tas­ma­nia, which has not recorded a case of com­mu­nity transmissi­on in 77 days, will ac­cept tourists from Western Aus­tralia and South Aus­tralia states, as well as the North­ern Ter­ri­tory – none of which has recorded com­mu­nity transmissi­on in more than 90 days.</p>
    <p>The new pol­icy, which be­gins on Aug 7, in­cludes stricter test­ing at air­ports.</p>
    <p>A doc­u­ment pub­lished on Thurs­day by China’s State Coun­cil also warned that the coun­try’s pub­lic health sys­tem should pre­pare for a pos­si­ble sec­ond wave of the virus in the win­ter... China re­ported</p>
    <p>21 new coro­n­avirus cases for Thurs­day, com­pared with 22 cases a day ear­lier, the health com­mis­sion said yes­ter­day.</p>
