    <p>TAR­IFFS</p>
    <p>The deal means there will be no tar­iffs or quo­tas on goods pro­duced in Britain and the Euro­pean Union mov­ing be­tween the two sides.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish ex­ports still have to com­ply with EU health and safety stan­dards and there are strict rules gov­ern­ing prod­ucts made with parts from out­side the EU or Britain.</p>
    <p>FISH­ING</p>
    <p>Britain wanted to take back full con­trol of its rich wa­ters, while EU coastal states sought to guar­an­tee that their fish­er­men could keep fish­ing there.</p>
    <p>The two sides reached a hard­fought com­pro­mise that will see EU grad­u­ally re­lin­quish 25 per cent of their cur­rent quo­tas in a 5 1/2- year tran­si­tion pe­riod. Af­ter that, there will be annual ne­go­ti­a­tions on the amount of fish EU ves­sels can take from Bri­tish wa­ters.</p>
    <p>LEVEL PLAY­ING FIELD</p>
    <p>The EU had in­sisted on “level play­ing field” rules to pre­vent Bri­tish</p>
    <p>firms hav­ing an ad­van­tage if Lon­don low­ers stan­dards or sub­sidises its in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>Britain had fought hard to avoid hav­ing a sys­tem that could see Brus­sels able to force it to fol­low EU’s rules on such is­sues as en­vi­ron­men­tal or labour reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>But Lon­don ad­mit­ted the deal al­lowed for ei­ther side to im­pose “coun­ter­mea­sures if they be­lieve they are be­ing dam­aged”, sub­ject to ar­bi­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>CUS­TOMS</p>
    <p>Britain will leave the EU’s Cus­toms union along with the sin­gle mar­ket at the end of the year,</p>
    <p>mean­ing that firms face new red tape for im­ports and ex­ports across the Chan­nel.</p>
    <p>SE­CU­RITY</p>
    <p>The deal will see both sides con­tinue to share DNA, fin­ger­print and pas­sen­ger de­tails and co­op­er­ate through EU’s Europol.</p>
    <p>MOVE­MENT OF PEO­PLE</p>
    <p>Bri­tons will be treated by the EU as “third coun­try” na­tion­als, no longer en­joy­ing free­dom of move­ment to work, study or re­tire across the EU.</p>
    <p>Britain in turn will process EU</p>
    <p>na­tion­als at its bor­ders as it does non-UK pass­port hold­ers.</p>
    <p>STU­DENTS & UNI­VER­SI­TIES</p>
    <p>From Jan 1, EU stu­dents go­ing to Britain will need a visa for cour­ses longer than six months, and will have to pay steeper tu­ition fees – four times as much for de­grees such as medicine or MBAs at pres­ti­gious uni­ver­si­ties.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish stu­dents want­ing to go to EU uni­ver­si­ties will en­counter higher fees in some coun­tries, as well as visa re­quire­ments that in many cases will curb their right to work in those coun­tries.</p>
