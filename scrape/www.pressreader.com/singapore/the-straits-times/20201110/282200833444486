    <p>A free­lance cam­era­man sex­u­ally abused his girl­friend’s two un­der­age daugh­ters over a pe­riod of six years and both suf­fered in si­lence as they were vi­o­lated by the man they had ac­cepted as their fa­ther.</p>
    <p>On one oc­ca­sion, he preyed on the older girl un­der the guise of play­ing a “game” in which she had to iden­tify dif­fer­ent spices and condi­ments that he put into her mouth while she was blind­folded.</p>
    <p>Af­ter she tasted in­gre­di­ents such as sugar and salt from his fin­ger, he low­ered his pants and forced the un­sus­pect­ing Pri­mary 5 school­girl to per­form a sex act on him.</p>
    <p>The man, now 36, was yes­ter­day sentenced to 17 years’ jail and 24 strokes of the cane af­ter he pleaded guilty to two counts of sex­ual as­sault by pen­e­tra­tion of a per­son un­der the age of 14 and two counts of out­rage of mod­esty against a per­son un­der the age of 14. An­other five charges, for var­i­ous sex­ual of­fences, were taken into con­sid­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>He can­not be named due to a gag or­der to pro­tect the iden­ti­ties of the two vic­tims, who are now 19 and 14 re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>The High Court heard that since 2010, the vic­tims had been told by their mother, a di­vorcee, to call the man “daddy” and they treated him as their own fa­ther be­cause their bi­o­log­i­cal fa­ther had left them when they were very young.</p>
    <p>The man oc­ca­sion­ally stayed over at their one-room flat and moved in per­ma­nently with the sisters, their el­der brother and mother some­time at the end of 2014 or early 2015.</p>
    <p>He be­gan sex­u­ally abus­ing the older girl in 2012, when she was in Pri­mary 5. While ev­ery­one in the house­hold slept to­gether in the liv­ing room, he com­mit­ted var­i­ous sex­ual acts on her, in­clud­ing touch­ing her gen­i­talia and mak­ing her per­form oral sex on him.</p>
    <p>The girl, who was then be­tween 10 and 11, felt an­gry and an­noyed but did not know how to stop him.</p>
    <p>Once, he forced her to per­form oral sex on him on the pre­text of play­ing the “blind­fold game”. Im­me­di­ately af­ter the act, he in­serted his fin­ger, which was dipped in some­thing spicy, into her mouth.</p>
    <p>This was to “de­ceive (the vic­tim) into think­ing that they were still play­ing the game”, said Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tors Nicholas Lai and Re­becca Wong in sen­tenc­ing ar­gu­ments.</p>
    <p>The abuse car­ried on for about three years un­til 2015.</p>
    <p>In 2014, the man also turned his at­ten­tion to the younger sis­ter, who was then eight, and abused her un­til 2017.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther sis­ter was aware of what had hap­pened to the other.</p>
    <p>On Sept 17, 2017, the younger girl felt she could not take the as­saults any more af­ter the man grabbed her breasts.</p>
    <p>The next day, she told school coun­sel­lors about the abuse, and they re­ported the mat­ter to the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment. A child pro­tec­tion of­fi­cer made a po­lice re­port af­ter call­ing the girl’s mother to meet her at the po­lice sta­tion .</p>
    <p>The ac­cused, who was with the woman at the time, fol­lowed her and was ar­rested at the sta­tion.</p>
    <p>The of­fences against the older girl came to light as a re­sult of in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the pros­e­cu­tion sought at least 17 years’ jail, ar­gu­ing that the man had ex­ploited his po­si­tion of au­thor­ity as a fa­ther fig­ure.</p>
    <p>De­fence coun­sel Ramesh Ti­wary sought 14 to 15 years’ jail, say­ing that the man’s de­ci­sion to plead guilty spared the girls from re-liv­ing their trauma by tes­ti­fy­ing in a trial.</p>
    <p>The man, now 36, was yes­ter­day sentenced to 17 years’ jail and 24 strokes of the cane af­ter he pleaded guilty to two counts of sex­ual as­sault by pen­e­tra­tion of a per­son un­der the age of 14 and two counts of out­rage of mod­esty against a per­son un­der the age of 14.</p>
