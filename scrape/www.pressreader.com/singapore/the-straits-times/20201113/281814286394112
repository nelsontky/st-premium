    <p>United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has no chance of re­vers­ing the re­sults of the just-con­cluded elec­tion through law­suits, ex­perts say.</p>
    <p>He con­tin­ues to chal­lenge the re­sults, which have Mr Joe Bi­den ahead by five mil­lion in the pop­u­lar vote, and 290 to 217 in the more im­por­tant Elec­toral Col­lege vote – a unique fea­ture of the US sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Thirty-one Elec­toral Col­lege votes are out­stand­ing from two states yet to be called – Geor­gia and North Carolina. But even if Mr Trump wins both states, he can­not reach the win­ning num­ber of 270. The math­e­mat­ics of the elec­tion is sim­ply against him.</p>
    <p>The Repub­li­can Party has launched an ar­ray of law­suits against al­leged ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties in sev­eral states. None has re­sulted in a favourable ver­dict. Le­gal ex­perts do not ex­pect any­thing to emerge that would have any sig­nif­i­cant im­pact on the re­sult.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, Mr Trump ap­pears in­tent on some­how push­ing his case up to the Supreme Court. The only prob­lem: at least as of now, he has no case.</p>
    <p>“There is no chance – zero – that this elec­tion can be over­turned,” Mr John Zogby, founder of the poll and data firm John Zogby Strate­gies, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“Thus far, all court chal­lenges that have reached judges have been dis­missed for lack of ev­i­dence. There is still no ev­i­dence be­ing pro­vided for any of the cur­rent and fu­ture chal­lenges.”</p>
    <p>So, why is the Pres­i­dent do­ing this?</p>
    <p>One rea­son is ob­vi­ous: He hates to lose.</p>
    <p>A sec­ond is more sin­is­ter – that he is lay­ing the ground for the equiv­a­lent of a coup d’etat. In or­der to do that, he must dis­credit the sys­tem and main­tain his per­sona as a “real Amer­i­can” fight­ing a cor­rupt Wash­ing­ton “deep state” in bed with cor­rupt politi­cians and lib­eral glob­al­ist elites.</p>
    <p>In an ar­ti­cle in The Bos­ton Globe, pro­fes­sor of his­tory Ti­mothy Snyder from Yale Uni­ver­sity warned: “What we face now in the United States is a new, Amer­i­can in­car­na­tion of the old false­hood: that Don­ald Trump’s de­feat was not what it seems, that votes were stolen from him by in­ter­nal en­e­mies – by a left-wing party.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump claims that his votes were all “le­gal votes”, as if by def­i­ni­tion those for his op­po­nent were not, Prof Snyder added.</p>
    <p>“We might like to think that this is all some strat­egy to find the Pres­i­dent an exit ramp. But per­haps that is wish­ful think­ing.”</p>
    <p>“Cling­ing to power by claim­ing you are the vic­tim of in­ter­nal en­e­mies is a very dan­ger­ous tac­tic. Don’t un­der­es­ti­mate where this can go,” Prof Snyder warned.</p>
    <p>An­other rea­son be­ing spec­u­lated is that Mr Trump is pre­par­ing to try again in 2024 for the White House, or pos­si­bly push­ing for­ward one of his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Yet an­other is that it is a “scorched earth” tac­tic, lever­age to get im­mu­nity for him­self and his fam­ily, from fu­ture prose­cu­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s former na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser John Bolton – no favourite of lib­er­als – who had an ac­ri­mo­nious break with the Pres­i­dent, on Wed­nes­day wrote in The Wash­ing­ton Post: “The real is­sue is the griev­ous harm he is caus­ing to public trust in Amer­ica’s con­sti­tu­tional sys­tem.”</p>
    <p>Even though on flimsy ground, the job is done; even if most Amer­i­cans be­lieve Mr Bi­den won a fair elec­tion, most Re­pub­li­cans seem to be­lieve the Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>The “coup” may take a more Machi­avel­lian but ten­u­ously le­gal route as well – ma­nip­u­lat­ing the Elec­toral Col­lege.</p>
    <p>On Dec 14, the elec­tors will meet in their states and cast their bal­lots for pres­i­dent and vice-pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>In a po­ten­tial, if long shot, sce­nario, the Pres­i­dent could have Repub­li­can-ma­jor­ity state leg­is­la­tors ram through ap­point­ments of new elec­tors.</p>
    <p>Key swing states Ari­zona and Geor­gia have Repub­li­can gov­er­nors and leg­is­la­tures. Michi­gan, Penn­syl­va­nia and Wis­con­sin have Demo­cratic gov­er­nors but Repub­li­can leg­is­la­tures.</p>
    <p>If law­suits some­how scut­tle the cer­ti­fi­ca­tion of re­sults, leg­is­la­tors can step into the void – and pick pro-Trump elec­tors.</p>
    <p>While that may be chal­lenged in the Supreme Court, it is a route to by­pass­ing the pop­u­lar vote and sim­ply switch­ing dozens of Elec­toral Col­lege votes to Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, the Pres­i­dent’s son Don­ald Trump Jr. retweeted con­ser­va­tive com­men­ta­tor Mark Levin: “RE­MINDER TO THE REPUB­LI­CAN STATE LEG­IS­LA­TURES, YOU HAVE THE FI­NAL SAY OVER THE CHOOS­ING OF ELEC­TORS.”</p>
    <p>“It’s ba­si­cally hi­jack­ing democ­racy,” US news site Ax­ios quoted one lawyer de­scribed as fa­mil­iar with the process. “They’ve got noth­ing else; you’d be try­ing to deny Joe Bi­den 270.”</p>
    <p>What­ever the route cho­sen, the con­test could well lead to vi­o­lence, ex­perts have warned.</p>
    <p>To­mor­row, Wash­ing­ton DC will see op­pos­ing ral­lies for and against Pres­i­dent Trump.</p>
    <p>With the Pres­i­dent mov­ing loy­al­ists into top po­si­tions at the Depart­ment of De­fence, an­a­lysts are en­ter­ing un­charted ter­ri­tory – spec­u­lat­ing on the role of the US mil­i­tary in a con­sti­tu­tional cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“Un­der­es­ti­mat­ing Don­ald</p>
    <p>Trump is a mis­take that peo­ple should not go on mak­ing,” Prof Snyder wrote.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter all, a claim that an elec­tion was il­le­git­i­mate is a claim to re­main­ing in power.”</p>
    <p>The “coup” may take a more Machi­avel­lian but ten­u­ously le­gal route as well – ma­nip­u­lat­ing the Elec­toral Col­lege. On Dec 14, the elec­tors will meet in their states and cast their bal­lots for pres­i­dent and vice-pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>In a po­ten­tial, if long shot, sce­nario, the Pres­i­dent could have Repub­li­can­ma­jor­ity state leg­is­la­tors ram through ap­point­ments of new elec­tors.</p>
