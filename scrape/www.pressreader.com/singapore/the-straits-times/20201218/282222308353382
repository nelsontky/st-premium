    <p>WELLING­TON New Zealand’s econ­omy grew a record 14 per cent in the third quar­ter from the pre­vi­ous three months, bounc­ing back from a Covid-19 lock­down ear­lier in the year that shut busi­nesses and brought ac­tiv­ity to a stand­still.</p>
    <p>An­nual gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) rose 0.4 per cent, Sta­tis­tics New Zealand said yes­ter­day, with both fig­ures beat­ing ex­pec­ta­tions in a Reuters poll for quar­terly growth of 13.5 per cent and an an­nual con­trac­tion of 1.3 per cent.</p>
    <p>The GDP num­bers also topped the Re­serve Bank of New Zealand’s Novem­ber fore­cast of quar­terly and an­nual growth of 13.4 per cent and mi­nus 1.3 per cent, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>The New Zealand dol­lar was largely muted in re­sponse, as mar­kets had al­ready fac­tored in a strong re­cov­ery af­ter a sharp con­trac­tion in the sec­ond quar­ter fol­low­ing Covid-19 re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond-quar­ter GDP was re­vised to a drop of 11 per cent from an ini­tial es­ti­ma­tion of mi­nus 12.2 per cent. On an an­nual av­er­age ba­sis, GDP fell 2.2 per cent in the year ended Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>“This is as close as you get to a true V-shaped re­cov­ery,” said Ki­wibank chief econ­o­mist Jar­rod Kerr. All in­dus­tries recorded large in­creases in ac­tiv­ity, and a sec­ond wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions in Auck­land in Au­gust ap­pears to have had a muted im­pact, he added.</p>
    <p>New Zealand is among a hand­ful of economies that man­aged to con­tain Covid-19 within their bor­ders. Busi­nesses, schools and of­fices in the coun­try have re­turned to al­most pre-coro­n­avirus nor­malcy.</p>
    <p>The Trea­sury said on Wed­nes­day that it ex­pected the coun­try to bounce back sooner than pre­vi­ously thought. Fis­cal and mone­tary stim­u­lus has played a part in the re­bound, and yes­ter­day’s re­sults could move the dial on how much fur­ther sup­port is needed, West­pac Bank said in a note.</p>
    <p>“For the Re­serve Bank’s part, the bot­tom line is whether in­fla­tion is on track to meet its man­dated tar­get. A stronger-than-ex­pected econ­omy cer­tainly goes in that di­rec­tion, but this needs to be bal­anced against other de­vel­op­ments such as the sharply higher New Zealand dol­lar,” West­pac se­nior econ­o­mist Michael Gordon said.</p>
