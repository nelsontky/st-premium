    <p>BANGKOK • More than 1,000 protesters took to the streets i n Bangkok yes­ter­day, the fifth day they have de­fied a gov­ern­ment ban aimed at stop­ping three months of ac­tion to de­mand the oust­ing of Thai Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chano-cha and re­forms to the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>Protesters at Kaset­sart in­ter­sec­tion raised the three-fin­ger salute of op­po­si­tion to the gov­ern­ment and chanted “Get Out, Get Out” in ref­er­ence to Mr Prayut.</p>
    <p>Demonstrat­ions were also held in two other places – an area in front of the Bangkok Re­mand Prison, where de­tained lead­ers of the protests are be­ing held, and the MRT’s Pub­lic Health Min­istry sta­tion in Non­thaburi, the Bangkok Post re­ported.</p>
    <p>A Thai court yes­ter­day granted bail to 19 people who had been ar­rested in con­nec­tion with the protests, the Thai Lawyers for Hu­man Rights group said.</p>
    <p>But those re­leased did not in­clude any of the main protest lead­ers, the group said.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s protests, which com­prised mostly young people, saw the BTS sky­train’s ser­vices af­fected. The metro an­nounced that it would not stop at three sta­tions from 5.30pm, and re­sumed op­er­a­tions only about two hours later in the evening, af­ter the crowds had dis­persed peace­fully.</p>
    <p>Else­where in the coun­try, demonstrat­ions also took place in var­i­ous univer­sity cam­puses and parks, in­clud­ing Songkhla Univer­sity in north-east Thai­land and at the Three Kings Mon­u­ment in Chi­ang Mai, the Bangkok Post re­ported.</p>
    <p>The protesters is­sued four de­mands: The re­lease of their de­tained com­pa­tri­ots, Mr Prayut’s res­ig­na­tion, Par­lia­ment to con­sider the people’s con­sti­tu­tional amend­ment Bill, and monar­chy re­forms.</p>
    <p>The pro-democ­racy ral­lies have been in­creas­ingly or­gan­ised through the use of mes­sag­ing apps, pos­ing a chal­lenge for po­lice to track or crack down on them.</p>
    <p>As the un­rest con­tin­ued with no end in sight, in­vestors dumped Thai stocks yes­ter­day, push­ing the coun­try’s bench­mark eq­uity in­dex down 2 per cent to a six-month low.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts warned of a po­ten­tial sell-off in the coun­try’s cur­rency as well, as wor­ries mount that es­ca­lat­ing con­fronta­tion be­tween the au­thor­i­ties and protesters could drag Asia’s worst-per­form­ing mar­ket even lower.</p>
    <p>The baht fell 0.1 per cent to 31.24 per dol­lar on a day when the Amer­i­can cur­rency was weak­en­ing against most other cur­ren­cies.</p>
    <p>“The re­cent po­lit­i­cal de­vel­op­ments... are un­set­tling in­vestors’ nerves,” said Mr Kobsidthi Silpachai, head of cap­i­tal mar­kets re­search of Kasiko­rn­bank. “Such an at­mos­phere prompts in­vestors to re­duce risk.”</p>
