    <p>Aid for the more af­fected sec­tors in the mar­itime in­dus­try will be ex­tended un­der the Mar­itimeSG To­gether Pack­age to tide them over the Covid-19 pan­demic, the Mar­itime and Port Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MPA) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>With var­i­ous re­lief mea­sures un­der the pack­age set to ex­pire after Dec 31, MPA said it will ex­tend some of these un­til June 30 next year, bring­ing the cu­mu­la­tive amount of sup­port to $33 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>These in­clude fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance for sea­far­ers, port dues con­ces­sion for ships that carry pas­sen­gers, and ex­ten­sion of credit terms for mar­itime com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>The Mar­itimeSG To­gether Pack­age took ef­fect on May 1 to pro­vide sup­port for ship­ping com­pa­nies, Sin­ga­porean sea­far­ers and peo­ple un­der­go­ing mar­itime train­ing, to the tune of $27 mil­lion. This was on top of re­lief mea­sures an­nounced by the Gov­ern­ment in four sup­ple­men­tary Bud­gets.</p>
    <p>MPA chief ex­ec­u­tive Quah Ley Hoon said in a state­ment that MPA recog­nises the con­tin­ued chal­lenges faced by some in the mar­itime in­dus­try, and is com­mit­ted to sup­port­ing them through the ex­ten­sion of re­lief mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Mea­sures that are not ex­tended will lapse after Dec 31. These in­clude a 30 per cent port dues con­ces­sion for ocean-go­ing cargo ves­sels.</p>
    <p>The Sea­far­ers Re­lief Pack­age for el­i­gi­ble Sin­ga­porean sea­far­ers, who face un­cer­tainty with in­creased bor­der con­trol mea­sures and crew change re­stric­tions, will be ex­tended.</p>
    <p>Those un­able to se­cure ship­board em­ploy­ment be­tween Jan 1 and June 30 next year can ap­ply. The pack­age pro­vides up to $700 a month in fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance for a max­i­mum of six months.</p>
    <p>There are about 500 Sin­ga­porean sea­far­ers who could ben­e­fit from the pack­age. MPA said it worked with the Sin­ga­pore Mar­itime Of­fi­cers’ Union and the Sin­ga­pore Or­gan­i­sa­tion of Sea­men for the ex­ten­sion.</p>
    <p>The three or­gan­i­sa­tions, with the Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute, will ex­tend an award scheme to re­ward el­i­gi­ble sea­far­ers with up to $10,000 for suc­cess­fully ob­tain­ing their Sin­ga­pore-is­sued Cer­tifi­cate of Com­pe­tency 1 and ac­cu­mu­lat­ing at least six months of work­ing ex­pe­ri­ence in se­nior ship­board man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>An­other scheme to help mar­itime com­pa­nies pro­vide in­tern­ship op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans or per­ma­nent res­i­dents will be ex­tended for a fur­ther six months.</p>
    <p>MPA co-funds 50 per cent of the in­tern­ship al­lowance paid by these com­pa­nies, capped at $500 per month per in­tern, up to a max­i­mum of six months.</p>
    <p>Co-fund­ing sup­port of up to 90 per cent for se­lected train­ing schemes – to en­cour­age skills im­prove­ment and dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion ef­forts – will be ex­tended for an­other six months.</p>
    <p>With pas­sen­ger vol­umes re­main­ing low due to the pan­demic, MPA said it will con­tinue to pro­vide eco­nomic re­lief to pas­sen­ger ves­sel own­ers and op­er­a­tors, as well as pas­sen­ger ter­mi­nal op­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>A 50 per cent port dues con­ces­sion for pas­sen­ger-car­ry­ing ves­sels from March 1 to Dec 31 that was pre­vi­ously an­nounced will be ex­tended for an­other six months.</p>
    <p>Pas­sen­ger ter­mi­nal op­er­a­tors Sats-Creuers Cruise Ser­vices and Sin­ga­pore Cruise Cen­tre will be granted a 100 per cent waiver of their pub­lic li­cence fees for one more year.</p>
    <p>As for com­pa­nies which face dif­fi­cul­ties man­ag­ing their cash flows, MPA said it will con­tinue to ex­tend credit terms of up to an ad­di­tional 45 days, be­yond the ex­ist­ing 30-day stan­dard credit terms, un­til June 30 next year.</p>
    <p>The mar­itime in­dus­try con­trib­utes about 7 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct and em­ploys more than 170,000 workers, ac­cord­ing to the Mar­itime Sin­ga­pore web­site.</p>
