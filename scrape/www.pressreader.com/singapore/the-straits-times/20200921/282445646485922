    <p>Prof Chew said reg­u­lar aer­o­bic ex­er­cise of moderate in­ten­sity for at least 30 min­utes every day has been shown to im­prove blood pres­sure, lipid pro­file, in­sulin sen­si­tiv­ity and re­duce ad­verse car­dio­vas­cu­lar out­comes as­so­ci­ated with meta­bolic syn­drome.</p>
    <p>He also ad­vised se­niors with the con­di­tion to do re­sis­tance ex­er­cises at least twice a week to en­hance mus­cle health.</p>
    <p>Prof Mer­chant cau­tioned against con­sum­ing sug­ary food and drinks and pro­cessed food. In­stead, she ad­vised adopt­ing a diet rich in whole grains, fruits, veg­eta­bles, lean meat, skin­less poul­try and non-fried fish, and low-fat or fat-free dairy prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>She also high­lighted the im­por­tance of go­ing for a med­i­cal checkup an­nu­ally to screen for di­a­betes, and high blood pres­sure and choles­terol.</p>
    <p>A study done by re­searchers from</p>
    <p>Tu­lane Uni­ver­sity in New Or­leans found that peo­ple with meta­bolic syn­drome are more likely to have worse Covid-19 out­comes.</p>
    <p>The study ex­plored the in­di­vid­ual ef­fects of obe­sity, hy­per­ten­sion and di­a­betes on Covid-19 sever­ity and com­pared them with their com­bined ef­fect in pa­tients with meta­bolic syn­drome.</p>
    <p>The re­search, pub­lished in peer­re­viewed med­i­cal jour­nal Di­a­betes Care, showed that Covid-19 pa­tients with meta­bolic syn­drome were more than three times more likely to die than those with­out it. They were also nearly five times more likely to be ad­mit­ted to an in­ten­sive care unit or re­quire a ven­ti­la­tor.</p>
    <p>Said Prof Mer­chant: “In the cur­rent cli­mate, it is im­por­tant for peo­ple to strengthen their im­mune re­sponse by ex­er­cis­ing reg­u­larly, drink­ing enough wa­ter and main­tain­ing a healthy diet of fruit and veg­eta­bles.”</p>
    <p>She also stressed the im­por­tance of prac­tis­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing and good per­sonal hy­giene habits.</p>
