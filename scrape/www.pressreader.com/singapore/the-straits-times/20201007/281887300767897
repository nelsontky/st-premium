    <p>The cav­a­lier at­ti­tude among In­done­sians to­wards the coro­n­avirus has of­ten been cited as the main rea­son for the spike in cases in the coun­try. En­force­ment of­fi­cers strug­gle to con­vince peo­ple to heed the rules, as found out.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian pub­lic or­der of­fi­cer Lana Har­di­nata has watched ev­ery­one around him like a hawk ev­ery day for the past six months.</p>
    <p>He is look­ing out for those who break health pro­to­cols, such as by not wear­ing face masks or stand­ing too close to one an­other. They may re­ceive a stern warn­ing or be fined, or pub­licly shamed into per­form­ing com­mu­nity ser­vice by don­ning bright orange vests and sweep­ing the side­walks of Jakarta.</p>
    <p>No one has been de­tained so far; the cen­tral gov­ern­ment has said that this will be re­served for those who refuse to prac­tise safe dis­tanc­ing and wear masks.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment has set its poli­cies for our mu­tual in­ter­est. The ban on gath­er­ing aims to pre­vent in­fec­tion. Those in­fected by the virus are mostly asymp­to­matic,” Mr Lana said when rep­ri­mand­ing a group of four peo­ple who were not wear­ing their masks prop­erly.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic or­der of­fi­cers, known lo­cally as Sat­pol PP, have joined forces with the po­lice and sol­diers to clear the streets of crowds and any­one who breaks the rules meant to keep peo­ple safe from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mr Lana, 34, said his job is a tough one as In­done­sians are so­cial peo­ple who en­joy in­ter­act­ing with their friends in close prox­im­ity.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times ac­com­pa­nied him on one of his re­cent pa­trols with other of­fi­cers in a truck. Along the way, the of­fi­cers hopped on and off the ve­hi­cle fre­quently to dis­perse crowds, chase away hawk­ers who dis­re­garded so­cial dis­tanc­ing, and urge peo­ple to fol­low the rules.</p>
    <p>Many in­di­vid­u­als could be seen hur­riedly pulling up their face masks from un­der their chins when the of­fi­cers ar­rived, but re­moved them as soon as they left.</p>
    <p>Mr Lana knew many were only putting on a show for the of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>“As you can see, ev­ery time pub­lic or­der of­fi­cers pass by, peo­ple quickly put on their masks prop­erly al­though we don’t scold them. This means they know they are guilty,” he said. “Even though we have told them re­peat­edly and stepped up our su­per­vi­sion, peo­ple con­tinue to break rules.”</p>
    <p>Jakarta Gov­er­nor Anies Baswedan reim­posed a par­tial lock­down in the city on Sept 14, but the re­stric­tions are less se­vere than the curbs in April. While restau­rants and cafes can pro­vide only de­liv­er­ies and take­aways, non-es­sen­tial business sec­tors are al­lowed to op­er­ate with 25 per cent of their em­ploy­ees work­ing in of­fices.</p>
    <p>The Jakarta ad­min­is­tra­tion has vowed to get tougher on those who flout the rules, warn­ing of pro­gres­sively heav­ier fines. Yet, to many Sat­pol PP of­fi­cers like Mr Lana, the job re­mains chal­leng­ing.</p>
    <p>The hard­est task by far is to con­vince peo­ple that Covid-19 ex­ists, he said. “Many don’t be­lieve it. That’s why we al­ways make them aware that Covid-19 ex­ists. It’s real, but it’s in­vis­i­ble.”</p>
