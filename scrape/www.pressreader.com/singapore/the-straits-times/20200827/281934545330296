    <p>UNITED NA­TIONS • A con­tro­ver­sial bid by the United States to reim­pose in­ter­na­tional sanc­tions on Iran has been blocked by the United Na­tions, with the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil say­ing it could not pro­ceed with the dis­puted move.</p>
    <p>The pres­i­dency of the UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil, as­sumed this month by In­done­sia, is “not in a po­si­tion to take fur­ther ac­tion” on Wash­ing­ton’s re­quest, said am­bas­sador Dian Tri­an­syah Djani on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>In a video con­fer­ence on the Mid­dle East, the In­done­sian diplo­mat cited the lack of con­sen­sus in the UN’s high­est body on the US strat­egy as the main rea­son.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion ac­cuses Te­heran of fail­ing to com­ply with the terms of the his­toric 2015 Iran nu­clear deal, and is de­mand­ing the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil reim­pose sanc­tions on the Is­lamic Repub­lic. Wash­ing­ton in­sists on its le­gal right to trig­ger the dis­puted pro­ce­dure, called “snap­back”, de­spite pulling out of the deal two years ago.</p>
    <p>The move threat­ens to tor­pedo the Iran ac­cord and plunge the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil into cri­sis, while widen­ing the gulf be­tween the US and al­most ev­ery other mem­ber on Iran pol­icy. Thir­teen of the 15 Coun­cil mem­bers had writ­ten to the In­done­sian pres­i­dency to re­ject its va­lid­ity.</p>
    <p>The US “is alone” in the ap­proach, and its “ul­ti­mate goal is to de­stroy the nu­clear agree­ment when it has al­ready im­posed (na­tional) sanc­tions on Iran”, a diplo­mat who spoke on con­di­tion of anonymity told AFP. An­other said that with the sound re­jec­tion of the US bid by al­most the en­tire coun­cil, “nor­mally the mat­ter is closed”.</p>
    <p>The US did not see it that way. “We re­minded mem­bers of our right un­der Res­o­lu­tion 2231 to trig­ger snap­back, and our firm in­tent to do so in the ab­sence of courage and moral clar­ity by the coun­cil,” said US am­bas­sador to the UN Kelly Craft.</p>
    <p>The move, never be­fore used, comes af­ter the US suf­fered a hu­mil­i­at­ing de­feat at the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil ear­lier this month when it failed to muster sup­port for a res­o­lu­tion to ex­tend a con­ven­tional arms em­bargo on Iran. Ac­cord­ing to the 2015 agree­ment, in which sanc­tions against Iran were lifted in ex­change for it agree­ing not to de­velop nu­clear weapons, a no­ti­fi­ca­tion that Te­heran has bro­ken its prom­ise must in prin­ci­ple be fol­lowed by a draft res­o­lu­tion by the pres­i­dency of the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>The ex­clu­sion of this op­tion by In­done­sia was wel­comed on Tues­day by most of the Coun­cil mem­bers.</p>
    <p>The Ira­nian mis­sion to the UN wel­comed the coun­cil’s re­jec­tion of the US move. Iran said the US re­quest, “in­clud­ing all ref­er­ences therein, are null and void, have no le­gal stand­ing and ef­fect and are thus com­pletely in­ad­mis­si­ble”.</p>
