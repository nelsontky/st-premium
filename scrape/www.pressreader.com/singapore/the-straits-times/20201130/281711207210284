    <p>BANGKOK • Hun­dreds of pro­test­ers marched on a bar­racks of Thai­land’s royal guards unit yes­ter­day, hoist­ing in­flat­able rub­ber ducks high above their heads in a whim­si­cal show of force by a pro-democ­racy move­ment call­ing for curbs to the power of the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>The yel­low toy has been har­nessed as a sym­bol by the pro­test­ers, whose lead­ers have em­pha­sised peace­ful tac­tics de­spite re­cent use of wa­ter can­non and tear gas by se­cu­rity forces.</p>
    <p>But their de­mands to re­form the king­dom’s monar­chy – once a taboo topic due to a dra­co­nian royal defama­tion law – have sent shock waves through Thai­land’s po­lit­i­cal and rul­ing class.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s protest – the lat­est in a se­ries of near-daily turnouts across Bangkok – was meant to tar­get the 11th In­fantry Reg­i­ment.</p>
    <p>Along with the 1st In­fantry Reg­i­ment, the two units were placed un­der King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn’s di­rect con­trol last year – a move ex­perts saw as a way for the monarch to as­sert more au­thor­ity.</p>
    <p>“These two reg­i­ments have been in­volved in crack­ing down on peo­ple in the past,” said prom­i­nent protest leader Parit “Pen­guin” Chi­warak. “They have also played key roles in past coups.”</p>
    <p>The black-clad pro­test­ers wore hair clips with yel­low rub­ber ducks, while those on the front line donned gas masks and hel­mets – pre­pared for any po­ten­tial skir­mishes with the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The en­trances, gates and walls of the bar­racks were cov­ered with coils of barbed wire, while the po­lice in riot gear stood guard out­side.</p>
    <p>“The things used against us are bought us­ing our taxes, so they are us­ing our money to hurt us,” 30-year-old grad­u­ate stu­dent Farng told Agence France-Presse, de­clin­ing to pro­vide her full name.</p>
    <p>“As tax­pay­ers, the army should be serv­ing us, not the monar­chy,” she said. “Their duty should be to pro­tect the peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>The mil­i­tary has long po­si­tioned it­self as a defender of Thai­land’s enor­mously wealthy royal fam­ily.</p>
    <p>In the name of pro­tect­ing the King, the army has staged more than a dozen coups since the end of ab­so­lute monar­chy in 1932.</p>
    <p>The most re­cent was in 2014. Protests which be­gan in July ini­tially de­manded the de­par­ture of</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha, a for­mer junta leader, and a new Con­sti­tu­tion, but now also seek to curb the pow­ers of the King.</p>
    <p>The For­eign Min­istry said in a state­ment that the coun­try ad­hered to the rule of law, but that the right to free­dom of speech must keep within it.</p>
    <p>“In ev­ery case where the law is vi­o­lated, of­fi­cials take ac­tion with strict ad­her­ence to the ap­pro­pri­ate le­gal pro­cesses without dis­crim­i­na­tion,” the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut has re­jected pro­test­ers’ de­mands that he quit, along with their ac­cu­sa­tions that he en­gi­neered last year’s elec­tion to keep power that he first took from an elected gov­ern­ment in 2014.</p>
    <p>The Royal Palace has made no com­ment since the protests be­gan, but the King has said that de­spite their ac­tions, the pro­test­ers are loved “all the same”.</p>
