    <p>Hav­ing more op­po­si­tion MPs in Par­lia­ment will mean a greater di­ver­sity of views and more ro­bust de­bate, said Leader of the House In­dra­nee Ra­jah yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>But Sin­ga­pore should work to en­sure that this di­ver­sity does not lead to po­lar­ity of coun­try or peo­ple, she added in a min­is­te­rial state­ment on the du­ties and priv­i­leges of the Leader of the Op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>“Ex­pe­ri­ence else­where shows that unity in di­ver­sity is not an as­sured out­come,” said Ms In­dra­nee, who is Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice.</p>
    <p>“Our goal should be to har­ness this di­ver­sity of views in a con­struc­tive man­ner, so that we can as a Par­lia­ment bet­ter serve the in­ter­ests of Sin­ga­pore­ans and Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>There are 12 op­po­si­tion MPs in Par­lia­ment – 10 elected MPs from the Work­ers’ Party (WP) and two NonCon­stituency MPs from the Progress Sin­ga­pore Party.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong had an­nounced af­ter the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion that WP chief Pri­tam Singh will be for­mally des­ig­nated as Leader of the Op­po­si­tion (LO).</p>
    <p>With more op­po­si­tion MPs in the House, re­flect­ing the strong de­sire among Sin­ga­pore­ans for a greater di­ver­sity of views in pol­i­tics, it is “timely and ap­pro­pri­ate” that the po­si­tion of LO be more for­mally recog­nised, Ms In­dra­nee said.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh will sit op­po­site PM Lee in Par­lia­ment, sim­i­lar to the prac­tice in other coun­tries that recog­nise this role, she added.</p>
    <p>She noted that the post of LO is not pro­vided for in Sin­ga­pore’s Con­sti­tu­tion or the Stand­ing Or­ders of Par­lia­ment. The Govern­ment had con­sid­ered the con­ven­tions and prac­tices of other West­min­ster­style par­lia­men­tary sys­tems, such as those in the United King­dom and Aus­tralia, in de­cid­ing the LO’s du­ties and priv­i­leges, she added.</p>
    <p>“What I have set out... re­flects what we have adapted to suit our cur­rent po­lit­i­cal and par­lia­men­tary con­text,” she said.</p>
    <p>As LO, Mr Singh will have the right to ask the lead ques­tion to min­is­ters on poli­cies, Bills and mo­tions, sub­ject to ex­ist­ing speak­ing con­ven­tion and at the dis­cre­tion of the Speaker of Par­lia­ment. The House also moved a mo­tion to dou­ble the time he has for his speeches to 40 min­utes – equiv­a­lent to that given to po­lit­i­cal of­fice-hold­ers.</p>
    <p>He will be given an of­fice in Par­lia­ment, staff sup­port and an al­lowance that is dou­ble that of an elected MP, or $385,000 a year.</p>
    <p>“With more op­po­si­tion MPs in Par­lia­ment, we hope the op­po­si­tion will play a big­ger role in putting up al­ter­na­tive views and pro­pos­als for de­bate,” Ms In­dra­nee said, as she set out the LO’s du­ties.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh (Alju­nied GRC) will be re­spon­si­ble for lead­ing the op­po­si­tion in pre­sent­ing al­ter­na­tive views in par­lia­men­tary de­bates on poli­cies, Bills and mo­tions. He will also lead and or­gan­ise the scru­tiny of govern­ment po­si­tions and ac­tions in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, he will be con­sulted on the ap­point­ment of op­po­si­tion MPs to se­lect com­mit­tees, in­clud­ing stand­ing se­lect com­mit­tees like the Pub­lic Ac­counts Com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>He may also be called upon to at­tend of­fi­cial state func­tions, and will from time to time re­ceive con­fi­den­tial brief­ings by the Govern­ment to en­sure bet­ter un­der­stand­ing across both sides of the House on is­sues such as na­tional se­cu­rity and ex­ter­nal re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>“The role of the Leader of the Op­po­si­tion in Sin­ga­pore will evolve with our pol­i­tics,” Ms In­dra­nee said. “It must al­ways be the am­bi­tion of this House to live up to the ex­pec­ta­tions of our peo­ple and cre­ate a po­lit­i­cal sys­tem that is fo­cused on serv­ing Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore­ans to the best of our abil­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>She added that she looks for­ward to work­ing with Mr Singh to achieve th­ese out­comes.</p>
    <p>Speaker Tan Chuan-Jin said he looks for­ward to work­ing with Ms In­dra­nee and Mr Singh to en­sure the “pro­duc­tive and or­derly con­duct” of par­lia­men­tary busi­ness and de­bates. “I’m also con­fi­dent that un­der their ca­pa­ble lead­er­ship and cooperatio­n across the aisle, the deco­rum, dig­nity and hon­our of the House will be up­held by all mem­bers at all times.”</p>
