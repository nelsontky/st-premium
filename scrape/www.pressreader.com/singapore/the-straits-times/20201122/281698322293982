    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had no new coron­avirus cases in the com­mu­nity for the 11th day in a row.</p>
    <p>There were also no cases in the dor­mi­to­ries yes­ter­day, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) re­ported.</p>
    <p>There were five new coron­avirus cases con­firmed as of noon yes­ter­day, all of which were im­ported.</p>
    <p>They were all placed on stay-home no­tice upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore and tested dur­ing that pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Four were asymp­to­matic and were de­tected from proac­tive screen­ing and sur­veil­lance, while one was symp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>One case is a Sin­ga­porean who re­turned from Mex­ico, while an­other is a Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent who re­turned from Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>An­other two are work per­mit hold­ers cur­rently em­ployed in Sin­ga­pore who ar­rived from the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing case is a longterm visit pass holder who ar­rived from Oman.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Bugis Street and the Ko­pi­tiam @ Jurong East were places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were still in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>MOH pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes and the times they vis­ited them to get peo­ple who were at those places at the same time to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>It has said that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and that there is no need to avoid th­ese places as they would have been cleaned, if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with no new cases in the past week, MOH noted.</p>
    <p>Six more cases of coron­avirus in­fec­tion have been dis­charged from hos­pi­tals or com­mu­nity iso­la­tion fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>In all, 58,049 peo­ple have fully re­cov­ered from the in­fec­tion and dis­charged from hos­pi­tals or com­mu­nity care fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>There are cur­rently 22 con­firmed cases who are still in hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Of th­ese, most are sta­ble or im­prov­ing, but one is in crit­i­cal con­di­tion in the in­ten­sive care unit.</p>
    <p>An­other 34 are iso­lated and cared for at com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. Th­ese are those who have mild symp­toms, or are clin­i­cally well but still test pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 28 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
