    <p>NEW YORK The sound­track to Maya Mon­toya’s year was white noise. Specif­i­cally, a track on Spo­tify called Ce­les­tial White Noise: three whole hours of warm, sooth­ing fuzz.</p>
    <p>Ms Mon­toya, who is 27 and lives in Everett, Washington, had been a nanny up un­til the pan­demic. But when she found her­self out of work in April, she be­gan in­dulging in day­time naps, which ru­ined her sleep sched­ule.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been lis­ten­ing to the white noise all the time,” she said.</p>
    <p>De­spite play­ing the track most nights for the better part of 2020, Ms Mon­toya was still sur­prised when Ce­les­tial White Noise ap­peared at the top of her Spo­tify Wrapped chart this month. She posted a screenshot from the app on In­sta­gram, which was met with a del­uge of af­fir­ma­tion from her fol­low­ers.</p>
    <p>“So many peo­ple mes­saged me say­ing they got the ex­act same thing,” she said. “It was nice to know I wasn’t the only one blast­ing white noise into the ether so that I could sleep through­out all this.”</p>
    <p>In an av­er­age year, Spo­tify Wrapped is a shar­ing-op­ti­mised nov­elty hing­ing on nos­tal­gia for a time that has barely passed.</p>
    <p>But in 2020, this data mir­ror in­stead pre­sented many users with un­ex­pected em­pir­i­cal ev­i­dence of their pan­demic-cop­ing mech­a­nisms: a strange hit pa­rade of am­bi­ent mu­sic, back­ground noise and calm­ing sound ef­fects that soothed them through an unusu­ally anx­ious and sleep­less time. Spo­tify de­clined to com­ment on this trend.</p>
    <p>While thou­sands of users posted in dis­be­lief about their stress­in­flected re­sults, the sit­u­a­tion made sense to cul­tural critic Liz Pelly, who has writ­ten ex­ten­sively about how Spo­tify and its com­peti­tors work to shape our lis­ten­ing habits.</p>
    <p>“It says a lot about the ways that cor­po­rate stream­ing ser­vices have in­grained them­selves into our lives and fa­cil­i­tated mu­sic lis­ten­ing be­com­ing more of a back­ground ex­pe­ri­ence,” she said.</p>
    <p>Some lis­ten­ers have used sound as a cop­ing mech­a­nism for years, but be­came more re­liant on it over the last nine months.</p>
    <p>Ms Iso­bel Snel­len­berger, a 21-year-old in Fargo, North Dakota, has anx­i­ety and is neu­ro­di­ver­gent (a cat­e­gory that in­cludes a range of neu­ro­log­i­cal dif­fer­ences, in­clud­ing autism spec­trum disor­der and dys­lexia), both of which she man­ages in a va­ri­ety of ways, in­clud­ing with mu­sic.</p>
    <p>“Es­pe­cially towards the be­gin­ning of Covid, my mind was rid­dled with in­tru­sive thoughts about my friends’ and fam­ily’s safety, and my brain would go into panic mode,” she said. So, she be­gan play­ing rain sounds al­most round-the­clock, which helped her turn off the cog­ni­tive noise.</p>
    <p>When her Spo­tify round-up ar­rived, nine of her top 10 tracks were rain sounds. “Even though I lis­ten to them a lot, I was still caught off guard,” she said, not­ing that Harry Styles and David Bowie typ­i­cally dom­i­nate her list. Like Ms Mon­toya, she found the re­sults both sad and funny.</p>
    <p>The find­ings of some forth­com­ing re­search about pan­demic cop­ing mech­a­nisms sug­gest am­bi­ent lis­ten­ing may be part of a larger pat­tern.</p>
    <p>Dr Pablo Ripolles, a pro­fes­sor at New York Univer­sity who stud­ies mu­sic and the brain, was part of an in­ter­na­tional team of re­searchers that sur­veyed lock­down habits in Italy, Spain and the United States.</p>
    <p>Of 43 ac­tiv­i­ties men­tioned in a sur­vey the team con­ducted, like cook­ing, prayer, ex­er­cise and sex, lis­ten­ing to or play­ing mu­sic had one of the big­gest in­creases in en­gage­ment dur­ing lock­down, as well as the high­est num­ber of re­spon­dents who said it was the ac­tiv­ity that helped them the most.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple re­al­is­ing from their Spo­tify Wrapped that they were lis­ten­ing to a lot more back­ground mu­sic to cope with the pan­demic fits with what we saw,” Dr Ripolles said.</p>
    <p>But not ev­ery­one wants to have the dark­ness of this year re­flected back at him. With the pan­demic ex­pected to en­dure, at least in some coun­tries, well into next year, a few savvy subscriber­s are us­ing a work­around to en­sure that next year’s re­cap is a lit­tle less grim.</p>
    <p>Video ed­i­tor Dy­lan River Lopez, has re­lied through­out the pan­demic on a track called Brown Noise – 90 Min­utes to drown out many dis­trac­tions.</p>
    <p>“I pretty much devel­oped a re­la­tion­ship with the noise,” said the 29-year-old. Lopez searched on­line about how to block Spo­tify from count­ing those min­utes. The an­swer: a fea­ture called Pri­vate Ses­sion, which Lopez now turns on along with the brown noise.</p>
