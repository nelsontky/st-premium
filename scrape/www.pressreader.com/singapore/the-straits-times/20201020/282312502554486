    <p>• Liver­pool’s stand­out de­fender Vir­gil van Dijk is fac­ing a lengthy ab­sence ow­ing to a knee in­jury and that gap­ing hole will open up the English Pre­mier League ti­tle race, pun­dit Jamie Car­ragher has said.</p>
    <p>The cham­pi­ons con­firmed late on Sun­day that the 29-year-old will have surgery for dam­aged lig­a­ments suf­fered dur­ing Satur­day’s 2-2 Mersey­side derby draw against Ever­ton af­ter a hor­ror chal­lenge by op­po­si­tion goal­keeper Jor­dan Pick­ford.</p>
    <p>The Eng­land No. 1 was not pe­nalised as van Dijk was ad­judged to be off­side when it hap­pened, even though pun­dits like Graeme Souness likened it to an “as­sault”.</p>
    <p>The Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion yes­ter­day con­firmed that Pick­ford will not face any ret­ro­spec­tive dis­ci­plinary ac­tion, a rul­ing that will in­cense Liver­pool as van Dijk may po­ten­tially be out for the rest of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>While the Reds have not given a time­line on his re­cov­ery pe­riod, Car­ragher be­lieves it is im­per­a­tive that manager Jur­gen Klopp signs another cen­tre-back in Jan­uary, given that the trans­fer win­dow has al­ready closed.</p>
    <p>“The big ques­tion you’re look­ing at now is, can Liver­pool win the league with­out van Dijk there? I think it blows the ti­tle race wide open,” the former Liver­pool de­fender, who played at An­field from 1996 to 2013, told Sky Sports.</p>
    <p>“I still felt at the start of this sea­son Liver­pool were the team to beat. With van Dijk out for what looks like the whole sea­son, it’s go­ing to be all on for Liver­pool.</p>
    <p>“Liver­pool have to go into the mar­ket in Jan­uary and not just be­cause of van Dijk’s in­jury. They were weak in that area any­way. They lost (De­jan) Lovren be­fore the start of the sea­son... oth­ers in those po­si­tions are in­jury prone.”</p>
    <p>Former Liver­pool mid­fielder Danny Mur­phy agreed, de­scrib­ing van Dijk as the best cen­tre-back in the world and claimed Liver­pool would be more vul­ner­a­ble with­out him.</p>
    <p>“(Mid­fielder) Fabinho can drop in there if (Joel) Matip and (Joe)</p>
    <p>Gomez are strug­gling but be­yond that, there’s not much there,” he told the BBC. “They’ve got to get through to Jan­uary with­out him.”</p>
    <p>Dutch cap­tain van Dijk said in a state­ment on so­cial me­dia that he was hop­ing to make a quick re­turn.</p>
    <p>“In foot­ball and in life, I be­lieve ev­ery­thing hap­pens for a rea­son and it’s im­por­tant to try and keep lev­el­headed whether go­ing though the highs or the lows,” he added.</p>
    <p>Since join­ing in Jan­uary 2018, the 2018-19 Pro­fes­sional Foot­ballers’ As­so­ci­a­tion Play­ers’ Player of the Year has had a trans­for­ma­tive ef­fect on Liver­pool, miss­ing only one Pre­mier League game and play­ing the last two full sea­sons.</p>
    <p>In his 95 Pre­mier League starts,</p>
    <p>Jur­gen Klopp’s men have let in just 78 goals and recorded 44 clean sheets, whereas in the 95 games be­fore his de­but, they con­ceded 117 goals with 29 clean sheets.</p>
