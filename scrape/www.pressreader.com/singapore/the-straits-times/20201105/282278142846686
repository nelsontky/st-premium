    <p>Cer­tifi­cate of en­ti­tle­ment (COE) prices ended l ower across the board in the lat­est ten­der yes­ter­day, fol­low­ing the start of a higher three-month quota.</p>
    <p>The COE price for cars up to 1,600cc and 130bhp fin­ished at $35,990, down from $37,334 two weeks ago. The pre­mium for cars above 1,600cc or 130bhp closed at $39,000, down from $40,990.</p>
    <p>The pre­mium for the Open COE, which can be used for any ve­hi­cle type ex­cept mo­tor­cy­cles but ends up pre­dom­i­nantly used for big­ger cars, ended slightly l ower at $39,500 from $39,889.</p>
    <p>The com­mer­cial ve­hi­cle COE price closed at $31,502, down from $33,778. Mo­tor­cy­cle pre­mi­ums fin­ished at $7,251, down from $7,300.</p>
    <p>The Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity an­nounced last month that the quota of COEs for cars (in­clud­ing Open COEs) will in­crease by 5.8 per cent to 4,865 a month for the Novem­ber to Jan­uary pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Of the lot, 1,925 will be for cars up to 1,600cc (down from 1,967), 2,014 for cars above 1,600cc (up from 1,729), and 926 for the Open cat­e­gory (up from 903).</p>
    <p>Com­mer­cial ve­hi­cle buy­ers will have 735 COEs a month, up from 674, while mo­tor­cy­clists will have 1,049 a month, up from 934.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, the av­er­age monthly quota comes up to 6,649, or 7.1 per cent more than for the pre­vi­ous pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Mr Ray­mond Tang, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Yong Lee Seng Mo­tor, said a drop in COE prices was ex­pected, given the in­crease in the COE sup­ply for this three-month pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“But it’s not a great drop... The mar­ket is still very strong,” he said. “There were a lot of buy­ers who were wait­ing to see what will hap­pen to the COE prices with the quota in­crease.”</p>
    <p>He added that the in­crease in COE sup­ply was due to a de­lay in cars get­ting scrapped dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod from April to June. This led to a spike in scrapped cars in the sub­se­quent months, which re­sulted i n the higher quota for new cars in the cur­rent cy­cle.</p>
    <p>“The COE sup­ply will fall and the price will rise again next year,” Mr Tang added.</p>
    <p>DE­MAND STILL STRONG</p>
    <p>It’s not a great drop... The mar­ket is still very strong. There were a lot of buy­ers who were wait­ing to see what will hap­pen to the COE prices with the quota in­crease. ’’</p>
