    <p>Food­ies know Shunfu Mart as a hawker cen­tre in Up­per Thom­son with con­ve­nient covered park­ing and some ex­cel­lent food stalls.</p>
    <p>Queues are of­ten seen at the muf­fin stall, the char kway teow stall, the prawn noo­dle stall, and the stall sell­ing soon kueh and suan pan zi (Hakka aba­cus seeds).</p>
    <p>Among them is a hum­ble-looking stall un­der the name Leong Hainanese Chicken Rice. It is run by Mr Neo Cheng Leong, 60, also known as Un­cle Leong, who has been sell­ing chicken rice for 30 years, from a stall in Novena, to Sin Ming, and now at Shunfu.</p>
    <p>The ob­ser­vant vis­i­tor to stall #02-22 at Block 320 Shunfu Road Mar­ket & Food Cen­tre will no­tice the slew of news­pa­per ar­ti­cles framed above the stall. Among them is one from The Straits Times on Aug 13, 2019, which named the stall No. 3 among Sin­ga­pore’s top five chicken rice stalls. Those who try Un­cle Leong’s fare know that the re­views do not lie. His chicken rice is fra­grant and slick. The chicken is juicy and ten­der, aro­matic, flavour­ful but not over­pow­er­ing.</p>
    <p>I’ve been eat­ing Un­cle Leong’s chicken rice for nearly 20 years. On a re­cent visit, I no­ticed a young man, in a black T-shirt and glasses, help­ing at the counter, busy pack­ing food and serv­ing cus­tomers. I found out Un­cle Leong had an ap­pren­tice. I re­turned the next day, on a Sun­day af­ter­noon when the stall is not busy, to find out more about this.</p>
    <p>THE AP­PREN­TICE</p>
    <p>As a child, Lim Wei Keat, now 25, en­joyed watch­ing cook­ing shows at his grand­mother’s house. He started ex­per­i­ment­ing with cook­ing for him­self in pri­mary school. By the time he fin­ished his O lev­els at Coral Sec­ondary School in Pasir Ris, he knew he wanted to be in the food and bev­er­age line. His grades were good enough to get him a place in a ju­nior college but he chose Te­masek Polytech­nic to study bak­ing and culi­nary sci­ence.</p>
    <p>He has worked at var­i­ous restau­rants, in­clud­ing three­Miche­lin-star French restau­rant Les Amis, where he was com­mis cook at the saucier sta­tion (mak­ing sauces). He went on to get a Bach­e­lor of Pro­fes­sional Stud­ies in Culi­nary Arts Man­age­ment from the Culi­nary In­sti­tute of Amer­ica, which has a joint pro­gramme with the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>He also clinched an in­tern­ship at Aqua­vit, a two-star Miche­lin restau­rant in New York known for its in­no­va­tive Nordic cui­sine.</p>
    <p>“I was all packed, and the visa and pa­per­work was all ready. Then, Covid hap­pened and the bor­ders closed,” said Mr Lim, shrug­ging. The New York in­tern­ship would have given him a foothold in the in­ter­na­tional fine din­ing scene. But here he was, stuck in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“Covid made me go back to ba­sics. I thought back to my stu­dent days. We of­ten went to New­ton Hawker Cen­tre for sup­per, for fried car­rot cake and sa­tay. When I started work, on my days off, I would go around and eat hawker food around Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“For Sin­ga­pore­ans, hawker food is what we re­turn to... I thought, with Covid and the lock­down, peo­ple are not going to spend a lot of money. Whereas hawker food is about feed­ing the masses.”</p>
    <p>The son of an en­gi­neer fa­ther and ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer mother, he says his think­ing about his ca­reer shifted. He found out about a pro­gramme run by the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) that helps de­velop young hawk­ers and pairs them with hawker men­tors for ap­pren­tice­ships. He grad­u­ated in Septem­ber this year and promptly en­rolled in the pro­gramme. Into his sec­ond week of a two-month ap­pren­tice­ship, Mr Lim says he has learnt a lot from Un­cle Leong.</p>
    <p>“My years of culi­nary train­ing can­not com­pare with his craft. We are trained to use in­duc­tion stoves and cook us­ing temperatur­e and time. We use met­ric and im­pe­rial mea­sure­ments. For Un­cle Leong, it is all by sight and feel. Just by sight, he knows if the wa­ter temperatur­e is right or whether the chicken is cooked – no need to use ther­mome­ter,” re­counts Mr Lim, who starts his work day at about 7am and leaves around 4pm, six days a week. The stall is closed on Mon­days.</p>
    <p>Food prepa­ra­tion is done by hand: pluck­ing the rem­nants of feath­ers off the raw chicken one by one; peel­ing the gin­ger and gar­lic; slic­ing the lemon grass and chilli. The stock is care­fully watched and stirred. The rice is boiled. The chilli is mixed in a food pro­ces­sor. Blanch­ing and poach­ing the chicken is done man­u­ally.</p>
    <p>For all the work, a plate of chicken rice costs $3; with drum­stick and rice, $3.50. It is $24 for a whole chicken, and $12 for half.</p>
    <p>THE FU­TURE</p>
    <p>There are 114 markets and hawker cen­tres run by the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency, with about 6,000 stalls of­fer­ing af­ford­able, de­li­cious meals. Some 85 per cent of Sin­ga­pore­ans eat out at least once a week, many at hawker stalls.</p>
    <p>But the hawker trade is at risk. Many hawk­ers are age­ing; and not enough young ones are en­ter­ing the trade, where the tra­di­tion­ally low prices of hawker food do not make for good busi­ness prof­its.</p>
    <p>As most hawker cen­tres are run by the Gov­ern­ment, rentals are kept low. The me­dian monthly rental of stalls in hawker cen­tres is about $2,100, com­pared with that of stalls in pri­vately run cof­fee shops or food­courts in com­pa­ra­ble lo­ca­tions, which can range from $4,000 to $13,000 a month.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, work hours for hawk­ers are a strain. Hawk­ers can’t sub­let their stalls and must per­son­ally op­er­ate them. They can’t hire for­eign workers, but few lo­cals want to be hawker as­sis­tants. This causes a labour crunch for the hawk­ers, many of whom rely on fam­ily mem­bers for help. Suc­cess­ful hawk­ers find it hard to scale up their busi­ness with­out staff.</p>
    <p>While hawker food re­mains pop­u­lar across all ages, many younger food­ies pre­fer to hang out at air-con cafes with free Wi-Fi, gladly pay­ing three to 10 times the price of a bowl of noo­dles for a plate of pasta.</p>
    <p>The NEA started its slew of train­ing, ap­pren­tice­ship and in­cu­ba­tion pro­grammes from 2013, to at­tract new hawk­ers to the trade. It sub­sidises up to half of stall rentals for 15 months.</p>
    <p>The In­cu­ba­tion Stall Pro­gramme drew 29 suc­cess­ful ap­pli­cants, of which 14 re­main in op­er­a­tion. Op­er­a­tors of new hawker cen­tres also at­tract new hawk­ers un­der a dif­fer­ent pro­gramme, drawing 54 op­er­a­tors, of which about half re­main in busi­ness. This means about 40 new hawk­ers were drawn by var­i­ous pro­grammes into the trade since 2013.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a new hawker devel­op­ment pro­gramme rolled out this year of­fers more hand-hold­ing for hawker wannabes – it in­cludes busi­ness op­er­a­tions train­ing and an ap­pren­tice­ship. Close to 150 peo­ple signed up. About 50 went on to do ap­pren­tice­ships, of which 35 are mov­ing on to the in­cu­ba­tion stage where they set up their own stalls.</p>
    <p>De­spite the small num­bers, the NEA says the “re­sults have been promis­ing”. En­cour­ag­ingly, the me­dian age of new en­trants into the hawker trade since 2013 is 46 years. Among new en­trants to the hawker cen­tres run by social en­ter­prises, the me­dian age is even younger, at 34. The me­dian age of all hawk­ers is 60.</p>
    <p>RE­SPECT HAWK­ERS’ AR­TI­SANAL SKILLS</p>
    <p>What can be done to at­tract more young peo­ple into the hawker trade? This is­sue has been raised many times, but is given ur­gency this year, as Sin­ga­pore has nom­i­nated its hawker cul­ture to be added to the Unesco Rep­re­sen­ta­tive List of the In­tan­gi­ble Cul­tural Her­itage of Hu­man­ity. (Dis­clo­sure: I am on the nom­i­nat­ing com­mit­tee.)</p>
    <p>An in­ter­na­tional ex­pert body this week rec­om­mended that Sin­ga­pore’s bid be ac­cepted. A 24-mem­ber Unesco in­ter-gov­ern­men­tal com­mit­tee will make the fi­nal de­ci­sion next month.</p>
    <p>Such in­ter­na­tional recog­ni­tion, if re­ceived, would put the spot­light sharply on hawker cul­ture, in­clud­ing its sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Neo is one of about 40 hawker men­tors will­ing to take on ap­pren­tices un­der the NEA’s pro­gramme. “Hawker food is our her­itage. If we don’t teach the young, how will it sur­vive? Do we want to end up eat­ing mala hot­pot at hawker cen­tres?” he asked, re­fer­ring to the pop­u­lar food trend from China.</p>
    <p>So what can make hawker cul­ture more sus­tain­able?</p>
    <p>The NEA’s myr­iad pro­grammes do help. Be­yond that, sug­ges­tions in­clude giv­ing hawk­ers more lee­way to em­ploy staff, in­clud­ing for­eign­ers. Chang­ing mind­sets so cus­tomers stop see­ing hawker fare mainly as cheap eats and ap­pre­ci­ate the craft that goes into the de­li­cious fare. Clean­ing up hawker cen­tres and the im­age of hawk­ers.</p>
    <p>When I asked Mr Lim what would at­tract his peers into the hawker trade, he was quick with his views.</p>
    <p>First, re­move the social stigma and recog­nise them as crafts­men with ar­ti­sanal skills.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple ask me, you have a de­gree, why do you want to be a hawker? You can work in a Miche­lin-starred restau­rant. So the first thing is to re­move the social stigma of be­ing a hawker.”</p>
    <p>His New York dream set aside, Mr Lim knows what he wants: “My plan is to try my hand at run­ning a hawker stall, do­ing chicken rice. I hope to pre­serve local her­itage and hope that more peo­ple of my age will fol­low suit.”</p>
    <p>Sec­ond: Make hawker cen­tres more at­trac­tive places to eat and work in.</p>
    <p>Point­ing to the clut­tered ta­bles, some with my­nahs or pi­geons peck­ing at food left­overs, he says: “Look around you. A lot of young peo­ple now pre­fer to go to cafes.”</p>
    <p>Third: Im­prove work con­di­tions in the kitchen. The cook­ing area is small and stuffy, and poorly ven­ti­lated.</p>
    <p>Fourth: Cus­tomers must re­spect the craft of hawk­ers and be pre­pared to pay more.</p>
    <p>Many Sin­ga­pore­ans think noth­ing of“pay­ing $15 for a few slices of smoked salmon with a poached egg”; or “$12 for a plate of car­bonara which isn’t even real car­bonara”, he says, adding that car­bonara sauce is made with egg yolk, guan­ciale (bacon made from pork jowl), black pep­per and pecorino Romano (salty cheese made from sheep’s milk).</p>
    <p>Yet many will com­plain if a bowl of noo­dle costs more than $4 at a hawker cen­tre. Such dou­ble stan­dards in cus­tomers’ spend­ing habits un­der­es­ti­mate the ar­ti­sanal value of many hawker dishes.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing ob­served the skill and work that go into cook­ing a sim­ple dish of chicken rice, the ap­pren­tice says ad­mir­ingly of his men­tor chef: “Can you imag­ine it – this guy spent 30 years learn­ing to cook a bird.”</p>
    <p>He sums up suc­cinctly: “At $3, his craft is un­der­val­ued.”</p>
    <p>PEO­PLE’S FARE</p>
    <p>For Sin­ga­pore­ans, hawker food is what we re­turn to... I thought, with Covid and the lock­down, peo­ple are not going to spend a lot of money. Whereas hawker food is about feed­ing the masses.</p>
