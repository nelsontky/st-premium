    <p>When the Covid-19 pan­demic struck, Sea Wheel travel agency trans­port man­ager Goh Jin Xiong was wor­ried that the elderly might not have been get­ting enough food.</p>
    <p>So he de­cided to de­liver hawker food to se­niors on week­days for nearly three months, as part of the YMCA Wok The Talk project, where vol­un­teers de­liv­ered more than 70,000 meals to vul­ner­a­ble groups be­tween May and July.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh, 35, said: “Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, most food cen­tres and daycare cen­tres were closed.</p>
    <p>“The elderly who lived alone might not have been fit enough to cook for them­selves, and there was no one to take care of them.</p>
    <p>“There were days when I had to de­liver over 30 pack­ets of food to flats in 10 (Hous­ing Board) blocks in the rain. But the hard work was all worth it when I saw the elderly folk wait­ing for me.”</p>
    <p>For putting in nearly 100 hours of vol­un­teer work, Mr Goh was awarded the YMCA-Lim Kim San Vol­un­teer Ex­cep­tional Award on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The in­au­gu­ral award is given to those who made ex­tra­or­di­nary con­tri­bu­tions in Covid-19 relief ef­forts. It is named af­ter Sin­ga­pore’s first fi­nance min­is­ter Lim Kim San, who was a YMCA hon­orary life mem­ber.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh was among the 96 award win­ners.</p>
    <p>They in­cluded busi­nesses, ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tions and in­di­vid­u­als who gave their time to char­i­ta­ble causes.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the vir­tual cer­e­mony, Mr Eric Chua, who is Par­lia­men­tary Sec­re­tary for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth as well as for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment, thanked the 6,000 vol­un­teers for help­ing 23,000 ben­e­fi­cia­ries and con­tribut­ing over 89,000 vol­un­teer hours in the past year.</p>
    <p>Fourth-year Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity stu­dent Heng Jun Jie, 25, who re­ceived the YMCALim Kim San Vol­un­teer Ex­cel</p>
    <p>lence Award for lead­ing vol­un­teer projects in Sin­ga­pore and over­seas, said: “There’s a warm feel­ing I get when kids ask me when I’m</p>
    <p>com­ing back again to vol­un­teer, when elderly folk talk to you like you’re their own son, and when mi­grant work­ers are happy with</p>
    <p>the ini­tia­tives my team and I put to­gether.”</p>
