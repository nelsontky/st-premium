    <p>PARIS Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer was full of praise for his “ex­cel­lent” Manch­ester United side on Tues­day af­ter Mar­cus Rash­ford’s late strike saw them win at Paris Saint-Ger­main in the Cham­pi­ons League for the sec­ond time in three sea­sons.</p>
    <p>“The per­for­mance was good and we de­served to win it. It was a bet­ter per­for­mance than last time and it shows how we have de­vel­oped,” the United boss said fol­low­ing the 2-1 vic­tory at the Parc des Princes in their Group H opener.</p>
    <p>Rash­ford’s 87th-minute ef­fort de­cided the en­counter in United’s favour af­ter An­thony Mar­tial’s own goal had can­celled out Bruno Fer­nan­des’ penalty.</p>
    <p>It was a stun­ning three points for the Premier League side away to last sea­son’s Cham­pi­ons League run­ners-up, and Sol­sk­jaer was de­lighted with the way his de­fence largely kept quiet the hosts’ star at­tack­ing trio of Ney­mar, Kylian</p>
    <p>Mbappe and An­gel di Maria.</p>
    <p>“We played against a fan­tas­tic team, and we have to de­fend well. The play­ers have the keys. I don’t think there is any se­cret, we need to play well and de­fend well to win against PSG,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Nor­we­gian elected to hand a de­but at left-back to trans­fer deadline re­cruit Alex Telles and play with Luke Shaw, Vic­tor Lin­de­lof and Axel Tuanzebe in a three-man cen­tral de­fence. It was the lat­ter’s first start of the year due to in­juries, but the United academy grad­u­ate looked like he had never been away.</p>
    <p>“We know Axel’s qual­i­ties, he’s a top de­fender. His first game in 10 months which is tes­ta­ment to the de­fender he is,” Sol­sk­jaer said.</p>
    <p>Pun­dit Owen Har­g­reaves agreed that Tuanzebe should keep his spot even when Harry Maguire and Eric Bailly re­turn from in­jury, telling BT Sport: “He’s not getting out of the side – if you’ve got this much ath­leti­cism in these po­si­tions.”</p>
    <p>Sol­sk­jaer also praised Rash­ford, whose dra­matic last-gasp penalty at the same end had given them a 3-1 vic­tory here in the last 16 in March last year.</p>
    <p>Jok­ing that the for­ward “likes that side of the sta­dium”, the Nor­we­gian added: “It’s a dif­fer­ent feel­ing from the last time we won here, it’s at the start of the group stage but we’ve beaten a fan­tas­tic team.</p>
    <p>“Last time, it was a knock­out and it was eu­phoric, this is ster­ile with­out the fans, but it’s still ex­cel­lent and we de­served to win.”</p>
    <p>Group H re­mains one of the trick­ier draws, with United fac­ing last sea­son’s Cham­pi­ons League semi-fi­nal­ists RB Leipzig at home next week. The Ger­man side had beaten Is­tan­bul Basak­se­hir 2-0 on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Af­ter that, the Red Devils have a dou­ble-header against the Turk­ish cham­pi­ons, with PSG still to visit</p>
    <p>Old Traf­ford in De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>“We know that to get through, you probably need 10 points,” Sol­sk­jaer said. “We only have three so Leipzig is a big game but we have Chelsea next then Arse­nal af­ter (Leipzig).”</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing PSG’s de­feat – their first group-stage home loss in 25 years – the group is now very much open, leav­ing coach Thomas Tuchel a wor­ried man in the dugout.</p>
    <p>Months be­tween PSG’s last two Cham­pi­ons League de­feats at the Parc des Princes, both times to Manch­ester United.</p>
    <p>The French tre­ble win­ners have been be­set by in­juries – five first­team play­ers were ab­sent against United – and they suf­fered another blow when an al­ready un­fit Idrissa Gu­eye had to go off with a prob­lem.</p>
    <p>Ad­mit­ting that PSG were never at the races, Tuchel said: “There was no in­ten­sity, no ag­gres­sive­ness, no press­ing, no counter-press­ing. It was weird, I don’t know why.”</p>
