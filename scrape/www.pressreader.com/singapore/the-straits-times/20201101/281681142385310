    <p>NICE (France) • A de­voted sex­ton re­spected for his en­ergy and good hu­mour. A Brazil­ian mother of three who never stopped smil­ing and passed on her ra­di­ant en­thu­si­asm to oth­ers. And a faith­ful church­goer with grown-up chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Three lives were bru­tally cut short in the at­tack by a sus­pected Is­lamist at the Notre-Dame Basil­ica in the south­ern French city of Nice, in what should have been a time of peace and re­flec­tion on Thurs­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Vin­cent Lo­ques, the basil­ica’s sex­ton charged with the up­keep of the build­ing, would have turned 55 on Fri­day, ac­cord­ing to parish priest Franklin Par­men­tier. “He took care of this church so it would be beau­ti­ful, and clean,” the priest told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>The sex­ton opened the basil­ica’s doors each day and pre­pared litur­gi­cal ob­jects for mass and other re­li­gious cer­e­monies. “He was a good man, full of en­ergy,” said for­mer parish priest Jean-Louis Gor­dian. Mr Lo­ques had re­mar­ried and had two daugh­ters from his first mar­riage.</p>
    <p>The Rev­erend Gil Florini, dean of the priests in Nice, said the sex­ton had worked for about 20 years at two churches in the city and was “kind, open, an or­di­nary guy in the good sense of the term”.</p>
    <p>Mr Lu­dovic Balade saw Mr Lo­ques al­most ev­ery morn­ing as the sex­ton had a cup of cof­fee near the church. “He was al­ways smil­ing, and al­ways had time for oth­ers, for the neigh­bour­hood and for his basil­ica,” he said.</p>
    <p>Parish trea­surer Jean-Fran­cois Gour­don noted that Mr Lo­ques came from a fam­ily of clergy, and said he re­ceived “217 voice mes­sages and more than 300 texts” ask­ing about the sex­ton af­ter the at­tack. He had pre­vi­ously worked in con­struc­tion, was handy with tools and built “mag­nif­i­cent” manger scenes for Christ­mas, Mr Gour­don re­called.</p>
    <p>Ms Si­mone Bar­reto Silva, 44, was a sin­gle mother of three chil­dren, two of whom are very young, neigh­bours said. The Brazil­ian woman was able to run to a restau­rant nearby af­ter be­ing at­tacked, but died there of her wounds.</p>
    <p>“Si­mone was an ex­tra­or­di­nary woman, al­ways smil­ing; she spoke with every­one and came to eat with us with her fam­ily and sis­ter,” said Ms An­gela Tavares, who runs a cafe and restau­rant that serves food from Cape Verde in the build­ing where Ms Silva lived.</p>
    <p>Ms Silva of­ten stopped over for cof­fee be­fore go­ing to pick up her chil­dren at school. “She liked pi­can­has, a Brazil­ian spe­cial­ity made with beef. The other day we put some mu­sic on and we danced to­gether,” Ms Tavares re­called as tears welled up in her eyes.</p>
    <p>Ms Nathalie Moya, who runs Fo­rum Jorge Fran­cois, an as­so­ci­a­tion that aids women, said of Ms Silva: “We worked with her as part of our ‘Women and Stars’ project that helps pro­vide food-ser­vice train­ing. She earned her diploma two years ago and wanted to open a restau­rant.”</p>
    <p>Lit­tle is known of the third vic­tim, a woman aged 60 who suf­fered the most savage vi­o­lence and has yet to be named. She was mar­ried, had grown-up chil­dren and of­ten went to the church, a source close to the case said.</p>
    <p>Anti-ter­ror­ist pros­e­cu­tor Jean-Fran­cois Ri­card said that the woman’s body was found at the basil­ica en­trance and her throat had been cut “deeply in the man­ner of a de­cap­i­ta­tion”.</p>
