    <p>When Covid-19 be­gan its march across the world ear­lier this year, in­ter­na­tional diplo­macy all but came to a halt. Meet­ings were can­celled and diplo­mats were grounded as bor­ders slammed shut.</p>
    <p>It was a challenge, said Am­bas­sador Umej Bha­tia, Sin­ga­pore’s Per­ma­nent Rep­re­sen­ta­tive to the United Na­tions Of­fice in Geneva where sev­eral UN or­gan­i­sa­tions are head­quar­tered, in­clud­ing the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO).</p>
    <p>“We couldn’t stay in the trenches and say, ‘Oh, we can’t work be­cause we don’t feel safe’.”</p>
    <p>Far from it. With mod­ern com­mu­ni­ca­tion tech­nol­ogy and work­ing re­motely in their of­fice, he and his staff in the Swiss city were among a group of Sin­ga­pore gov­ern­ment of­fi­cers who spear­headed a multi­na­tion ef­fort to de­velop and dis­trib­ute a Covid-19 vac­cine next year to all coun­tries, rich and poor, big and small.</p>
    <p>The need for such vac­cine mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism was stressed by Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong at the Global Vac­cine Sum­mit and the Global Goal: Unite For Our Fu­ture sum­mit, both held vir­tu­ally in June.</p>
    <p>Vac­cine na­tion­al­ism then was on the rise as gov­ern­ments around the world scram­bled to se­cure ex­clu­sive ac­cess to Covid-19 vac­cines ahead of any­one else.</p>
    <p>Mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism is not a luxury, said Mr Bha­tia, but an “ex­is­ten­tial ne­ces­sity” for small states that de­pend on global health se­cu­rity for the safe flows of trade and peo­ple.</p>
    <p>GROUP­ING TO FIND VAC­CINE</p>
    <p>The for­ma­tion of the Friends of the Covid-19 Vac­cine Global Ac­cess (Covax) Fa­cil­ity, or FOF, in­volved of­fi­cers from Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs, as well as the Min­istry of Health and Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board.</p>
    <p>Switzer­land joined, too, as cochair of FOF.</p>
    <p>“With larger coun­tries lock­ing up vac­cines for their own use, we worked against the clock and round the clock to ad­vance vac­cine mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism,” said the 50-year-old diplo­mat.</p>
    <p>Within weeks, the in­for­mal group­ing had 15 mem­bers brought to­gether by Sin­ga­pore: Aus­tralia, Canada, the Euro­pean Union, Ice­land, Is­rael, Ja­pan, South Korea, New Zealand, Nor­way, Qatar, Saudi Ara­bia, Sin­ga­pore, Switzer­land, the United Arab Emi­rates and the United King­dom.</p>
    <p>As of last Fri­day, all 15 had sub­mit­ted legally bind­ing com­mit­ment agree­ments to take part in Covax.</p>
    <p>The mis­sion of FOF is to dis­cuss and co-cre­ate the de­sign of Covax, par­tic­u­larly the fi­nanc­ing, gov­er­nance and al­lo­ca­tion of vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Un­der Sin­ga­pore’s lead­er­ship, it worked closely with Gavi, Cepi and WHO on these is­sues. Gavi is a pub­lic-pri­vate vac­cine al­liance, while Cepi (Coali­tion for Epi­demic Pre­pared­ness In­no­va­tions) is a global vac­cine part­ner­ship.</p>
    <p>Covax aims to make two bil­lion doses avail­able by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive did not go un­no­ticed. Vac­cine mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism has since been adopted by Euro­pean Com­mis­sion pres­i­dent Ursula von der Leyen and se­nior WHO of­fi­cials to push back against the forces of vac­cine na­tion­al­ism.</p>
    <p>A VOICE FOR SMALLER NA­TIONS</p>
    <p>SIZE IS NOT DES­TINY</p>
    <p>But why Covax and not a bi­lat­eral deal, which could be faster?</p>
    <p>Ac­knowl­edg­ing the com­plex­i­ties of mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism, Mr Bha­tia ex­plained that its ad­van­tage is that the 193 UN na­tions must fol­low a rules-based or­der. This means coun­tries can look for­ward to a more pre­dictable out­come, which ben­e­fits small states in par­tic­u­lar, he said.</p>
    <p>“Mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism ex­tends the range of op­tions for smaller states like Sin­ga­pore – not just on vac­cines, but other is­sues af­fect­ing the global com­mons that could come back to im­pact us, like cli­mate change.”</p>
    <p>Vac­cines, how­ever, are just one part of the pic­ture, he said.</p>
    <p>Also im­por­tant is ac­cess to other Covid-19 treat­ments and di­ag­nos­tic test kits, and this is where WHO’s</p>
    <p>Ac­cess to Covid-19 Tools Ac­cel­er­a­tor Fa­cil­i­ta­tion Coun­cil comes in.</p>
    <p>In June, Sin­ga­pore, as the con­vener and chair of the Fo­rum of Small States – an in­for­mal group­ing of 108 coun­tries with pop­u­la­tions of less than 10 mil­lion – was in­vited to the coun­cil.</p>
    <p>“There’s strength in num­bers, so this es­tab­lished a prece­dent for deal­ing with press­ing prob­lems (like Covid-19). Size is not des­tiny,” Mr Bha­tia added, stress­ing that Sin­ga­pore tries to play a con­struc­tive role de­spite its small size. “We were able to speak up and rep­re­sent the in­ter­ests of the small­est states, whose views could be ig­nored or put aside by big­ger ones.”</p>
    <p>BUD­DING SPACE IN­DUS­TRY</p>
    <p>One of the more es­o­teric bod­ies that Sin­ga­pore be­longs to is the UN Com­mit­tee on the Peace­ful Uses of Outer Space (Cop­uos).</p>
    <p>Its in­ter­ests in Cop­uos have more to do with the civil­ian and gov­ern­ment func­tions that outer space</p>
    <p>sup­ports, such as ur­ban plan­ning, weather mon­i­tor­ing and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s nascent space in­dus­try em­ploys more than 1,000 peo­ple across 30 com­pa­nies, in ac­tiv­i­ties like pack­ag­ing data from satel­lite im­agery for the con­struc­tion, mar­itime safety and agri­cul­ture sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Cop­uos looks after the norms gov­ern­ing these ac­tiv­i­ties, and is the fo­rum to co­or­di­nate and har­monise them glob­ally.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore does not join in­ter­na­tional group­ings merely to sat­isfy its “na­tional ego”, said Mr Bha­tia.</p>
    <p>“When we do so, it’s prac­ti­cal, there’s a key func­tion, and it ac­cords with what we need to achieve in terms of na­tional in­ter­est.”</p>
    <p>Size is not des­tiny... We were able to speak up and rep­re­sent the in­ter­ests of the small­est states, whose views could be ig­nored or put aside by big­ger ones.</p>
