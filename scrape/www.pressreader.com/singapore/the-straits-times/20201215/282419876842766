    <p>LON­DON • Arse­nal have lost four straight league games at home for the first time in 61 years.</p>
    <p>The Gun­ners have gone 12 hours and 32 min­utes with­out find­ing the net from open play. And with four wins and a draw af­ter 12 games, this is their worst start to a top-flight sea­son since 1974-75.</p>
    <p>Their tally of 10 goals af­ter 12 Premier League games is also their low­est at this stage of a top-flight sea­son since 1981-82.</p>
    <p>But af­ter go­ing down 1-0 at home to Burnley, a de­feat that saw the 2,000 fans in the Emi­rates boo the team off, Arse­nal man­ager Mikel Arteta claimed he is not press­ing the panic but­ton just yet.</p>
    <p>The pres­sure is build­ing on the Spa­niard, whose hon­ey­moon pe­riod that cul­mi­nated in their 13th FA Cup win last sea­son is over, with his side lan­guish­ing in 15th, just five points above the rel­e­ga­tion zone.</p>
    <p>While Arteta be­lieves he can turn the club’s for­tunes around, he ad­mit­ted the team was their own worst en­emy af­ter Granit Xhaka was shown the third red card of his Gun­ners ca­reer for grab­bing Ash­ley West­wood by the throat.</p>
    <p>The hosts lost their shape af­ter go­ing down to 10 men and to com­pound mat­ters, Pierre-Em­er­ick Aubameyang, who has yet to score from open play in the league since Septem­ber, net­ted at the wrong end to give the Clarets their first win at Arse­nal.</p>
    <p>“I wouldn’t say there’s panic. I can see in train­ing the way they try and the en­ergy they put in,” Arteta said. “A team that is strug­gling nor­mally you don’t see them play the way we were play­ing, and the way they played against Tot­ten­ham.</p>
    <p>“But we lost the game, we gave the op­po­nents a chance and they scored. At this level it is all about win­ning foot­ball matches.”</p>
    <p>Since Arteta’s ap­point­ment last year, Arse­nal have re­ceived six red cards in the league, dou­ble that of any other side in the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>On his play­ers’ in­abil­ity to con­trol them­selves – Nico­las Pepe served the fi­nal game of a three­match ban for a head­butt at Leeds – he said: “We know that th­ese things are unac­cept­able and the mo­ment that we are in now, it’s even more so.”</p>
    <p>De­spite his pos­i­tive out­look amid the gloom, de­fender Kieran Tier­ney said the team “de­served” to be heck­led off the pitch.</p>
    <p>“We are not show­ing the man­ager what we can do and how much we be­lieve in him,” he added. “Ev­ery game, there are signs we are do­ing a bit bet­ter but it is still not good enough.</p>
    <p>“There are no ex­cuses.”</p>
