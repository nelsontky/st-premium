    <p>It seemed like any other day, with no sig­nif­i­cant jump in the morn­ing and lunchtime crowds in the Cen­tral Busi­ness District (CBD) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This is de­spite the eas­ing of mea­sures which al­lowed more peo­ple to re­turn to the work­place from yes­ter­day, al­though em­ploy­ers still had to en­sure safe man­age­ment prac­tices such as stag­gered work ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>All of the of­fice work­ers The Straits Times spoke to yes­ter­day said they had re­turned to the work­place for a cou­ple of weeks. Stall­hold­ers in the CBD said the lunch crowd, al­though promis­ing, seemed to be no dif­fer­ent com­pared with that of pre­vi­ous weeks.</p>
    <p>With work-from-home ar­range­ments still the de­fault, the stall own­ers are hop­ing that more em­ploy­ers will adopt the re­laxed rules which, in turn, will lead to bet­ter busi­ness.</p>
    <p>There ap­peared to be no rush in the Cen­tral Busi­ness District yes­ter­day as rules were eased to al­low more peo­ple to re­turn to the work­place.</p>
    <p>Vis­its by The Straits Times to Raf­fles Place dur­ing the morn­ing rush hour and at noon showed a slow but steady stream of work­ers, but the crowds seemed no dif­fer­ent to those last Fri­day be­fore the re­lax­ing of work­place rules kicked in.</p>
    <p>All 30 work­ers whom ST in­ter­viewed said it was not their first time re­turn­ing to their work­places since the two-month cir­cuit breaker ended in early June.</p>
    <p>Barista Shawn Tan, 23, who works at a Star­bucks cof­fee out­let in Raf­fles Place, said there was “no sig­nif­i­cant dif­fer­ence” in the num­ber of cus­tomers yes­ter­day com­pared with the last few weeks.</p>
    <p>He now sees an av­er­age of 10 to 15 cus­tomers from 7.30am to 10am, but he no­ticed one reg­u­lar cus­tomer yes­ter­day whom he had not seen for ages and be­lieves she could have just re­cently re­turned to her work­place.</p>
    <p>The eas­ing of rules for peo­ple to re­turn to their work­places was an­nounced by Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence last Wed­nes­day. It came as the num­ber of Covid-19 cases in the com­mu­nity re­mained low.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers, though, have to en­sure that safe man­age­ment mea­sures are in place, and that flex­i­ble work­ing hours and stag­gered re­port­ing times are im­ple­mented.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, em­ploy­ees must con­tinue to work from home for at least half of their work­ing hours, and no more than half the num­ber of em­ploy­ees who are able to work from home are to be at the work­place at any point in time.</p>
    <p>For many peo­ple like Mr Ang Chung Yuh, 33, re­turn­ing to work in the CBD yes­ter­day morn­ing has been the case for sev­eral weeks now.</p>
    <p>The fixed in­come man­ager said he has been back at the of­fice since phase two of the re­open­ing be­gan in June and, for now, his com­pany was un­likely to change plans for split op­er­a­tions for em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>Mr Eric Neo, chief ex­ec­u­tive of in­vest­ment com­pany RF In­ter­na­tional Hold­ings, has been back in the of­fice since the cir­cuit breaker ended.</p>
    <p>Asked if he pre­ferred work­ing from home or in the of­fice, the 46-year-old said: “I’m a par­ent of two young kids so it’s def­i­nitely more pro­duc­tive work­ing from the of­fice.”</p>
    <p>Mr Neo also felt that the re­turn­ing CBD crowd in the past few weeks has cre­ated a sense that “the mar­ket is com­ing alive”. This was par­tic­u­larly ap­par­ent dur­ing lunchtime when the sight of queues at food stalls was a pos­i­tive sign for in­vestors and traders alike, he said.</p>
    <p>This was the case at Mar­ket Street In­terim Hawker Cen­tre which was packed dur­ing the lunch hour yes­ter­day, but stall own­ers in­ter­viewed by ST in­sisted that they had seen fewer cus­tomers and much shorter lunch hours in the past few weeks.</p>
    <p>A stall owner who wanted to be known only as Mr Loke, 47, said: “On good days, busi­ness is back to</p>
    <p>60 to 70 per cent of what it used to be, but the crowd mainly comes on Mon­days and Tues­days. For the rest of the week, it’s been rel­a­tively quiet.”</p>
    <p>Though he saw slightly more cus­tomers than usual yes­ter­day, he does not fore­see that busi­ness will im­prove much in the com­ing weeks, say­ing that it would be “per­haps around 10 per cent more than the cur­rent lunch crowd”.</p>
    <p>On the shorter lunch hours, he said: “In the past, queues would start to form as early as 11am, and the crowds would dis­perse by around 2pm, but the lunch crowd now seems to linger only from 12pm to 1.30pm.”</p>
    <p>Other stall own­ers in the vicin­ity hope the lunch crowds will re­turn as com­pa­nies be­gin to im­ple­ment stag­gered work ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>Mr Ger­ald Gan, 49, who co-owns Tai­wanese eatery Healthy Pas­sion at The Ar­cade, said: “I started see­ing some of my reg­u­lars over the past few weeks, but many were say­ing that their com­pa­nies needed more time to work out the lo­gis­tics of split-work op­er­a­tions, such as get­ting clean­ers in and en­sur­ing that of­fice pantries are stocked up.”</p>
