    <p>BARCELONA • Pele paid trib­ute to Lionel Messi af­ter the Barcelona cap­tain equalled the Brazil leg­end’s record for the most num­ber of goals with a sin­gle club.</p>
    <p>The Ar­gentina skip­per drew level with the three-time World Cup win­ner’s tally of 643 goals for San­tos, with a div­ing header on the stroke of half-time in Barcelona’s 2-2 draw with Va­len­cia in La Liga on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>“When your heart over­flows with love, it is dif­fi­cult to change your path,” Pele said in an In­sta­gram post. “Like you, I know what it’s like to love wear­ing the same shirt ev­ery day. Like you, I know that there is noth­ing bet­ter than the place we feel at home.</p>
    <p>“Con­grat­u­la­tions on your his­toric record, Lionel. But above all, con­grat­u­la­tions on your beau­ti­ful ca­reer at Barcelona. Sto­ries like ours, of lov­ing the same club for so long, un­for­tu­nately, will be in­creas­ingly rare in foot­ball. I ad­mire you very much.”</p>
    <p>While Messi achieved the feat in 748 matches, Pele needed only 665 games to reach the fig­ure and the 80-year-old also still holds the record for the most num­ber of ca­reer goals at 1,283. But de­spite the 33-year-old’s ef­forts, the fifth­placed hosts again stum­bled in their at­tempt to close the gap at the top of the Span­ish league.</p>
    <p>Lead­ers Atletico Madrid pulled fur­ther ahead af­ter Satur­day’s 3-1 home vic­tory over Elche, putting them eight points clear on 29 points with a game in hand.</p>
    <p>Lax de­fend­ing saw Mouc­tar Di­akhaby and Maxi Gomez score for the vis­i­tors and the Cata­lans have now dropped points in seven of their 13 La Liga games.</p>
    <p>Barca coach Ron­ald Koe­man was an an­gry man af­ter the game, slam­ming his side for switch­ing off in key mo­ments.</p>
    <p>The Dutch­man, whose side also net­ted via Ron­ald Araujo, said: “He (Di­akhaby) was all alone when he jumped up to score. We have to de­fend bet­ter and mark our op­po­nents more. We’re smaller than most teams and we have prob­lems at set pieces.</p>
    <p>“We gave an in­con­sis­tent per­for­mance... We lost the ball in dan­ger­ous ar­eas.”</p>
    <p>Va­len­cia man­ager Javi Gar­cia was pleased with his side’s pro­gres­sion – they are 12th with 15 points.</p>
    <p>“From the first minute to the last, we showed that we wanted to win,” he said. “It is a step for­ward com­pared to other games, in which we have not been so con­sis­tent.”</p>
