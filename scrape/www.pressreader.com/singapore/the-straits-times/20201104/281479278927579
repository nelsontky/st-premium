    <p>With more peo­ple get­ting on bi­cy­cles as a so­cially dis­tant way to get out and about dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, phys­io­ther­a­pists here are see­ing a jump in in­juries re­lated to cy­cling.</p>
    <p>Mr Jeremy Mok, a se­nior phys­io­ther­a­pist at Park­way East Hos­pi­tal, said: “Gen­er­ally, cy­cling in­juries are not com­mon. I would see about one case ev­ery two months. But since April, there has been at least one case ev­ery month.”</p>
    <p>Many of these in­juries re­sult from falls or col­li­sions.</p>
    <p>IT project man­ager Pa­trick See was cy­cling along Pen­juru Road with his friends last month when the front wheel of his bike hit the edge of a pot­hole, throw­ing him off the bike.</p>
    <p>“I tried to break the fall with my arm and broke my right wrist,” said the 59-year-old.</p>
    <p>He was sent to Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal and had his arm in a cast for 10 days be­fore go­ing for wrist re­con­struc­tion surgery. He has been un­der­go­ing phys­io­ther­apy to re­gain strength and move­ment in his wrist.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal’s de­part­ment of or­thopaedic surgery has also seen an uptick in cy­cling-re­lated in­juries, such as wrist and shoul­der dis­lo­ca­tions and frac­tured col­lar­bones.</p>
    <p>Dr Puah Ken Lee, a con­sul­tant at the de­part­ment, said com­mon cy­cling in­juries in­volve the up­per limbs and torso. “This is be­cause most cy­cling in­juries in­volve the cy­clist be­ing flung for­ward.”</p>
    <p>Ms Joyce Poh, a se­nior phys­io­ther­a­pist at Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal, said ac­ci­dents can hap­pen be­cause of poor bike con­trol and safety aware­ness, or un­fa­mil­iar­ity with new equip­ment and traf­fic rules.</p>
    <p>Aside from more se­ri­ous in­juries aris­ing from col­li­sions, phys­io­ther­a­pists have also seen cy­clists with strains and aches from overex­er­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Kelvin Ng, a se­nior phys­io­ther­a­pist at Sengkang Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal, has no­ticed a rise in cy­clin­gre­lated in­juries in the past few months, but not so much trau­matic ones. He said: “Repet­i­tive strain or overuse in­juries, on the other hand, seem more com­mon due to peo­ple cy­cling too fast, too far and too much.”</p>
    <p>Like week­end war­riors who push them­selves too hard at football or bas­ket­ball, Covid-19 cy­cling war­riors are also at risk of in­juries aris­ing from a sud­den in­crease in an ac­tiv­ity they are not used to do­ing.</p>
    <p>Dr Puah has seen more cy­cling in­juries than other sports-re­lated in­juries. This could be be­cause of re­stric­tions on group sport­ing ac­tiv­i­ties such as football and bas­ket­ball dur­ing the pan­demic, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Michael Yan, a clin­i­cal di­rec­tor at Bal­ance Core Phys­io­ther­apy Cen­tre, has ob­served “a slight in­crease” in cy­cling-re­lated in­juries since July. He said his clients come in with groin, knee or neck pain as­so­ci­ated with cy­cling.</p>
    <p>These pains are usu­ally caused by poor cy­cling tech­nique, he said.</p>
    <p>“For in­stance, keep­ing the knees too close to the cen­tre of the bi­cy­cle tends to cre­ate ten­sion on the hip flexor mus­cle and knees.”</p>
    <p>Poor cy­cling er­gonomics can also cause neck, back and knee pain. Bi­cy­cle han­dle­bars that are too low can cause in­creased stress to the back and neck as cy­clists may have to round their backs while cy­cling, noted Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal’s Ms Poh.</p>
    <p>Cy­clists may also de­velop knee con­di­tions. These in­clude quadri­ceps tendinopa­thy – in­flam­ma­tion of the ten­don of the large mus­cle on the front of the thigh – or patellofem­oral pain syn­drome, pain in the front of the knee and around the kneecap.</p>
    <p>“These could oc­cur due to a sad­dle height that is too low, which causes in­creased stress to the knee when ped­alling,” she added.</p>
    <p>To min­imise in­juries, it is im­por­tant to choose the right bi­cy­cle and to warm up and cool down.</p>
    <p>Stretch­ing be­fore a ride will help pre­pare your mus­cles and joints for the high-in­ten­sity ac­tiv­ity, while stretch­ing after cy­cling can help re­lease ten­sion and tight­ness in the mus­cles, said Park­way East Hos­pi­tal’s Mr Mok.</p>
    <p>De­spite the risk of falls and col­li­sions, cy­cling has re­mained pop­u­lar dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Steven Lim, vice-pres­i­dent (safety and ed­u­ca­tion) of the Sin­ga­pore Cy­cling Fed­er­a­tion: “It is less tax­ing com­pared with run­ning and brings you to far­ther places.”</p>
    <p>There are also many ben­e­fits as­so­ci­ated with reg­u­lar cy­cling.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Mok: “Cy­cling helps with stress re­duc­tion, es­pe­cially dur­ing Covid-19. It also im­proves car­dio­vas­cu­lar fit­ness and helps with weight man­age­ment.”</p>
