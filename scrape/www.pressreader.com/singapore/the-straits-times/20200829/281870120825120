    <p>The United Na­tions chief yes­ter­day called In­dia’s grow­ing in­vest­ment in coal “deeply trou­bling” and warned that ex­pand­ing fos­sil fuel sub­si­dies is “a hu­man dis­as­ter and bad eco­nom­ics” that only means more deaths and ris­ing health­care costs.</p>
    <p>UN Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral An­to­nio Guter­res’ re­marks, made dur­ing an on­line lec­ture held by The En­ergy and Re­sources In­sti­tute in Ban­ga­lore, come as In­dia pre­pares to hold its first com­mer­cial coal mine auc­tion in Oc­to­ber. The gov­ern­ment has said auc­tion­ing 41 coal blocks is part of In­dia’s stim­u­lus for economic recovery from Covid-19. But cli­mate change ac­tivists and states with coal re­serves have op­posed the auc­tions. In­dia’s ma­jor coal in­vestor Adani Group will sit out the auc­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Guter­res said it makes “no com­mer­cial sense” to dou­ble down on do­mes­tic coal and open up coal auc­tions. As the cost of re­new­ables falls, and 39 per cent of coal plants be­come un­com­pet­i­tive – some 60 per cent could be­come so in 2022 – the world’s largest in­vestors are in­creas­ingly aban­don­ing coal, he added.</p>
    <p>In­dia is the world’s third largest emit­ter of green­house gases af­ter China and the United States.</p>
    <p>Coal pro­vides about half of In­dia’s com­mer­cial pri­mary en­ergy sup­ply and is the dom­i­nant fuel for power pro­duc­tion. It ac­counts for 80 per cent of all in­dus­trial emis­sions.</p>
    <p>In­dia has com­mit­ted to mak­ing clean re­new­able en­ergy 40 per cent of its en­ergy mix by 2040 and last year, its spend­ing on so­lar en­ergy sur­passed that on coal-fired power gen­er­a­tion for the first time.</p>
    <p>“Yet, here in In­dia, sub­si­dies for fos­sil fu­els are still some seven times more than sub­si­dies for clean en­ergy,” said Mr Guter­res. Many In­dian coal plants are fi­nan­cially dis­tressed, and ready to be over­taken by re­new­ables and clean coal plants.</p>
    <p>The UN chief spoke of In­dia’s role in staving off the threat of cli­mate change. This meant “end­ing fos­sil fuel sub­si­dies, plac­ing a price on car­bon pol­lu­tion and com­mit­ting to no new coal af­ter 2020,” he added.</p>
    <p>Twenty top busi­ness lead­ers from In­dia have signed a state­ment ask­ing the gov­ern­ment to ac­cel­er­ate the move away from coal, sup­port elec­tric ve­hi­cles, and pi­o­neer “green in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion”.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s cen­tral bank, in its lat­est an­nual economic out­look, said the im­pacts of cli­mate change would be the sever­est and In­dia would need an ap­pro­pri­ate frame­work to man­age fi­nan­cial risks from wors­en­ing and er­ratic weather con­di­tions. In­dia was hit by eight cy­clones last year while floods have al­ready dev­as­tated three states this year .</p>
    <p>Ex­perts expect coal to dom­i­nate the power econ­omy at least un­til 2030. They say that af­ter years of stitch­ing to­gether a clean coal pol­icy, In­dia has un­done th­ese plans.</p>
    <p>On May 21, it re­versed a Jan­u­ary 2014 no­ti­fi­ca­tion that re­quired ther­mal power plants to use coal with less than 34 per cent ash con­tent. New rules al­low power plants to use low­grade In­dian coal that pro­duces more fly ash, as long as they meet emis­sions norms and con­trol pol­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>Se­nior re­searchers Kanchi Kohli and Manju Menon wrote in a Cen­tre for Pol­icy Re­search re­port: “By re­fus­ing to rem­edy the gov­er­nance prob­lems of coal use ... the en­vi­ron­ment min­istry has put on the line the lives of the poor­est peo­ple re­sid­ing in the coun­try’s coal en­claves.”</p>
    <p>Mr Guter­res had this ad­vice for In­dia: “Do not bail out pol­lut­ing in­dus­tries. End fos­sil fuel sub­si­dies.”</p>
