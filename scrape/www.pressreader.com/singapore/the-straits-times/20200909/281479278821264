    <p>SEOUL • K-pop sen­sa­tion BTS’ (right) United States chart-top­ping sin­gle, Dy­na­mite, could gen­er­ate more than 1.7 tril­lion won (S$1.96 bil­lion) for the South Korean econ­omy and thou­sands of new jobs in the coun­try, a gov­ern­ment study claimed on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The trail­blaz­ing septet ce­mented their promi­nence in the world’s big­gest mu­sic market last week, when the all-English track de­buted at No. 1 on the Bill­board Hot 100.</p>
    <p>The feat eluded rap­per Psy, whose Gang­nam Style was a global megahit in 2012, but peaked at No. 2 in the US for seven weeks that year.</p>
    <p>The study by South Korea’s Min­istry of Cul­ture, Sports and Tourism and a gov­ern­ment tourism in­sti­tute pro­jected that the track would gen­er­ate 1.7 tril­lion won of eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity and nearly 8,000 new jobs.</p>
    <p>As well as di­rect sales of more than 400 bil­lion won, it would lead to nearly 600 bil­lion won of cos­met­ics sales and al­most 180 bil­lion won in food and drinks, the study found.</p>
    <p>The es­ti­mates were drawn from analysing the sales of BTS’ la­bel Big Hit En­ter­tain­ment, along with sta­tis­tics from South Korea’s Cus­toms, the cen­tral Bank of Korea and Google Trends data.</p>
    <p>It ex­cluded for­eign tourism in the face of tight travel re­stric­tions, im­posed by Seoul over the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, which have also led to sev­eral con­cert can­cel­la­tions.</p>
    <p>“If we in­clude the pro­jected tourism rev­enue down the road... we ex­pect the eco­nomic im­pact to be stronger,” the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>It added that the eco­nomic ef­fect will likely en­hance South Korea’s im­age and brand value.</p>
    <p>K-pop, along with K-drama soap op­eras, has been one of South Korea’s most suc­cess­ful cul­tural ex­ports.</p>
    <p>A key com­po­nent of the “Korean Wave” that has swept Asia and be­yond over the last two decades, the K-pop in­dus­try is es­ti­mated to be worth some US$5 bil­lion (S$6.83 bil­lion).</p>
