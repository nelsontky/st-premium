    <p>HONG KONG • China’s sweep­ing na­tional se­cu­rity law has forced tech­nol­ogy firms to re­con­sider their pres­ence in Hong Kong. The nim­blest among them – start-ups – are al­ready mov­ing data and people out or are de­vis­ing plans to do so.</p>
    <p>En­trepreneur­s now face a wave of con­cern from over­seas clients and sup­pli­ers about the im­pli­ca­tions of run­ning data and In­ter­net ser­vices un­der the law’s regime of ex­panded on­line polic­ing pow­ers. Many are mak­ing con­tin­gency plans and re­struc­tur­ing their op­er­a­tions away from Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Their ac­tions may fore­shadow sim­i­lar moves by In­ter­net gi­ants such as Face­book, Al­pha­bet’s Google and Twitter. The l arger firms are tak­ing time to fully as­sess the im­pact of the law, while sen­ti­ment in the city it­self is dour, with about half of US busi­ness people say­ing they plan to leave, a re­cent poll by the Amer­i­can Cham­ber of Com­merce in Hong Kong shows.</p>
    <p>“We are in a dilemma. If we fol­low the law in Hong Kong, we may vi­o­late other coun­tries’ reg­u­la­tions,” said Mr Ben Cheng, co­founder of soft­ware firm Oursky. “We worry that people will not trust us some day if we tell them we are a Hong Kong-based com­pany.”</p>
    <p>Oursky has al­ready had trou­ble in the short pe­riod since the law took ef­fect, with some for­eign cloud ser­vice providers re­fus­ing to work with Hong Kong-based en­ti­ties, Mr Cheng said. To cir­cum­nav­i­gate these is­sues, his com­pany will set up of­fices in Bri­tain in about a year and then ex­pand to Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>Tech com­pa­nies that han­dle data are par­tic­u­larly vul­ner­a­ble. The po­lice can ask them to delete or re­strict ac­cess to con­tent deemed to en­dan­ger na­tional se­cu­rity, with non-com­pli­ance pun­ish­able with a fine of HK$100,000 (S$18,000) and six months in prison for rep­re­sen­ta­tives of in­fring­ing pub­lish­ers. Such pro­vi­sions put tech­nol­ogy firms un­der “tremen­dous risk and li­a­bil­ity”, said Hong Kong l aw­maker Charles Mok. “It’s a sig­nal to these com­pa­nies to be very care­ful. If you want to be safe and you don’t want the un­cer­tainty, then maybe you have to leave Hong Kong.”</p>
    <p>In re­cent years, the global fi­nan­cial cen­tre has grown into an at­trac­tive des­ti­na­tion for fin­tech en­trepreneur­s, and its close prox­im­ity to Shen­zhen and the so-called Greater Bay Area has helped foster re­search and de­vel­op­ment ties be­tween start-ups and Chi­nese univer­si­ties. Hong Kong had been ex­pected to reach US$1.7 bil­lion (S$2.4 bil­lion) in data cen­tre rev­enue by 2023, ri­valling nearby Singapore whose server mar­ket brought in US$1.4 bil­lion last year, data from Struc­ture Re­search shows. All that is now un­der threat.</p>
    <p>Over half of Mea­sur­able AI’s clients are United States-based. The Hong Kong firm tracks busi­ness re­ceipts and pro­vides trans­ac­tional data to hedge funds and cor­po­ra­tions, many of which are con­cerned about how data trade may be af­fected by the Bei­jing law and Wash­ing­ton’s re­tal­ia­tory mea­sure of re­scind­ing Hong Kong’s spe­cial trade sta­tus. “Right now might be a good time for us to re­think how we can re­struc­ture or have the op­er­a­tions out­side of Hong Kong,” co­founder Heatherm Huang said, adding that the com­pany is ac­cel­er­at­ing plans to mi­grate parts of its busi­ness de­vel­op­ment and sales to Singapore and New York.</p>
    <p>Mr Scott Sa­landy-De­four, co­founder of en­ergy-tech start-up Liq­uid­star, said: “Do­ing a start-up in Hong Kong is al­ready dif­fi­cult. It’s a su­per ex­pen­sive city.” Even be­fore the new law, the sit­u­a­tion in the city was fraught with US-China ten­sions over ev­ery­thing from trade to hu­man rights. In­vestors have be­come very cau­tious about people and busi­nesses with ties to China and the new law “is like the last nail in the cof­fin”, said the en­tre­pre­neur, who is now plan­ning to re­lo­cate to Singapore.</p>
    <p>But Chi­nese Univer­sity of Hong Kong’s as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of eco­nomics Ter­ence Chong said: “This would be just a short-term phe­nom­e­non. I think af­ter they un­der­stand the so­ci­ety is more sta­ble, busi­nesses will come back. Hong Kong is the gate­way to China. If they want to have ac­cess to China’s mar­ket, it is the best place for them.”</p>
    <p>Sup­port­ers of the law see it as nec­es­sary to re­store in­vestor and busi­ness confidence by curb­ing months of some­times-vi­o­lent un­rest that have rocked the city.</p>
    <p>For some, the al­lure of closer in­te­gra­tion with China through the Greater Bay Area is too good a chance to pass up. “I think Hong Kong can still play the role it’s al­ways played, bring­ing in­ter­na­tional and Chi­nese play­ers in tech­nol­ogy closer to­gether,” said Mr Tony Verb, co-founder of GreaterBay Ven­tures. “I don’t see rea­sons right now to run away.”</p>
