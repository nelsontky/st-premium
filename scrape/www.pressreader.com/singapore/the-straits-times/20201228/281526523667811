    <p>GENEVA • The coro­n­avirus cri­sis will not be the last pan­demic, and at­tempts to im­prove hu­man health are “doomed” with­out tack­ling cli­mate change and an­i­mal wel­fare, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s (WHO) chief said.</p>
    <p>Dr Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus also con­demned the “dan­ger­ously short-sighted” cy­cle of throw­ing cash at out­breaks but do­ing noth­ing to pre­pare for the next one, in a video mes­sage mark­ing yes­ter­day’s first In­ter­na­tional Day of Epi­demic Pre­pared­ness.</p>
    <p>The WHO di­rec­tor-gen­eral said it was time to learn the lessons from the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“For too long, the world has op­er­ated on a cy­cle of panic and ne­glect,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We throw money at an out­break, and when it’s over, we for­get about it and do noth­ing to pre­vent the next one. This is dan­ger­ously short-sighted, and, frankly, dif­fi­cult to un­der­stand.”</p>
    <p>The Global Pre­pared­ness Mon­i­tor­ing Board’s Septem­ber 2019 first an­nual re­port on world readi­ness for health emer­gen­cies – pub­lished a few months be­fore the coro­n­avirus broke out – said the planet was woe­fully un­pre­pared for po­ten­tially dev­as­tat­ing pan­demics.</p>
    <p>“His­tory tells us that this will not be the last pan­demic, and epi­demics are a fact of life,” said Dr Te­dros. “The pan­demic has high­lighted the in­ti­mate links be­tween the health of hu­mans, an­i­mals and planet,” he added. “Any ef­forts to im­prove hu­man health are doomed un­less they ad­dress the crit­i­cal in­ter­face be­tween hu­mans and an­i­mals, and the ex­is­ten­tial threat of cli­mate change that’s mak­ing our earth less hab­it­able.”</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus has killed at least 1.76 mil­lion peo­ple, and more than 80 mil­lion cases have been recorded since the out­break emerged in China last De­cem­ber, ac­cord­ing to a tally from of­fi­cial sources com­piled by Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>Europe is the world’s hard­est-hit re­gion, pass­ing the 25 mil­lion case mark last Fri­day and with 546,000 deaths. Af­ter Europe, the United States and Canada make up the se­cond worst-hit re­gion, with 346,636 deaths out of over 19.4 mil­lion cases.</p>
    <p>The individual coun­tries with the largest num­ber of in­fec­tions are the US, with more than 18.9 mil­lion cases and 331,916 deaths; In­dia, with over 10.1 mil­lion cases and 147,343 deaths; and Brazil, with more than 7.4 mil­lion cases and 190,795 deaths.</p>
    <p>Last week, an av­er­age of 580,000 new cases were reg­is­tered every day.</p>
    <p>“In the past 12 months, our world has been turned up­side down. The im­pacts of the pan­demic go far be­yond the dis­ease it­self, with far-reach­ing con­se­quences for so­ci­eties and economies,” said Dr Te­dros. But he said the coro­n­avirus cri­sis should not have come as a sur­prise, given the re­peated warn­ings. “We must all learn the lessons the pan­demic is teach­ing us,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Te­dros called for stronger pri­mary health­care pro­vi­sion. With in­vest­ments in pub­lic health, “we can en­sure that our chil­dren and their chil­dren in­herit a safer, more re­silient and more sus­tain­able world”, he said.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Day of Epi­demic Pre­pared­ness was called for by the United Na­tions Gen­eral Assem­bly to pro­mote the im­por­tance of pre­ven­tion, pre­pared­ness and part­ner­ship in tack­ling epi­demics.</p>
    <p>INTERCONNE­CTEDNESS OF LIFE ON PLANET</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has high­lighted the in­ti­mate links be­tween the health of hu­mans, an­i­mals and planet. Any ef­forts to im­prove hu­man health are doomed un­less they ad­dress the crit­i­cal in­ter­face be­tween hu­mans and an­i­mals, and the ex­is­ten­tial threat of cli­mate change that’s mak­ing our earth less hab­it­able.</p>
