    <p>•</p>
    <p>LON­DON Pep Guardiola ad­mit­ted that Manch­ester City are not ready to sus­tain their level of play for 90 min­utes af­ter they ground out a 1-0 win over Arse­nal in the Pre­mier League on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>City dropped points in their two pre­vi­ous league games be­fore the in­ter­na­tional break and were again far from their free-flow­ing best with­out the in­jured Kevin de Bruyne and Aymeric La­porte.</p>
    <p>But af­ter a short pre­sea­son and a host of pos­i­tive coro­n­avirus tests and in­juries, Guardiola is con­tent just to stay “alive”.</p>
    <p>“We are not un­for­tu­nately able to sus­tain for 90 min­utes the way we want to play, but these games help us achieve it,” he said. “We need time to grow as a team. I think this game is go­ing to help us to make a step for­ward.”</p>
    <p>The Spa­niard added that his side were not af­forded “the prepa­ra­tion that Liver­pool or Arse­nal had”.</p>
    <p>“They had three more weeks than us, then we have four guys with Covid and af­ter that, Joao Cancelo and Bernardo (Silva) were in­jured in the in­ter­na­tion­als,” he added.</p>
    <p>“With the po­si­tion we have, it’s im­por­tant in games to take time and come back. La­porte is out and (Ben­jamin) Mendy is out... We can­not be 90 min­utes in the top level but we did it... We strug­gled a lot in the be­gin­ning, for the lack of prepa­ra­tion and amount of ab­sences but even with that, we’re still alive.”</p>
    <p>In a matched billed as a meet­ing be­tween master and ap­pren­tice, Guardiola won the bat­tle af­ter leav­ing his for­mer as­sis­tant Mikel Arteta be­mused by the most fluid of for­ma­tions.</p>
    <p>Arteta got the bet­ter of his old boss when the sides last met in the FA Cup semi-fi­nals in July and Guardiola re­sponded with a change to a 3-5-2 sys­tem to match up with Arse­nal. That pushed Ra­heem Ster­ling up front along­side Ser­gio Aguero, who was mak­ing his first ap­pear­ance since June. And Ster­ling was on hand to grab the only goal af­ter Bernd Leno could only parry Phil Fo­den’s ini­tial ef­fort.</p>
    <p>Arse­nal re­main with­out an away league win against one of the “Big Six” in 29 games dat­ing back to Jan­uary 2015. And de­spite a spir­ited per­for­mance, los­ing again at Liver­pool and the Eti­had in the first five games of the cam­paign shows the strides Arteta still has to make to re­store the Gun­ners as ti­tle con­tenders.</p>
    <p>“We’ve come a long way,” said Arteta. “I am up­set be­cause I think we de­serve more from the game.</p>
    <p>“I am ex­tremely happy about the per­for­mance, the at­ti­tude, the courage to play they way we did today. I can­not de­mand much more from the play­ers apart from the three big chances we have, you have to score.”</p>
    <p>Arse­nal were left to rue two huge op­por­tu­ni­ties late in the first-half as they were de­nied by City goal­keeper Eder­son. They also saw strong penalty ap­peals fall on deaf ears with the fi­nal ac­tion of the first-half when Kyle Walker’s high foot was not pun­ished as he chal­lenged Gabriel Ma­gal­haes inside the area.</p>
    <p>Early in the sec­ond half, Aguero dis­puted a throw-in call then put his arm on the shoul­der of fe­male as­sis­tant ref­eree Sian Massey-El­lis.</p>
    <p>The Ar­gen­tinian, play­ing his first game since June af­ter knee surgery, was crit­i­cised on so­cial me­dia and his for­mer team-mate Micah Richards said on Sky Sports that Aguero should “know bet­ter”.</p>
    <p>Un­der rules in­tro­duced in 2016 play­ers can be cau­tioned or sent off for touch­ing match of­fi­cials de­pend­ing on the na­ture of the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>But City’s all-time record scorer went un­pun­ished and in his post­match press con­fer­ence, Guardiola de­fended his player.</p>
    <p>“Come on guys. Ser­gio is the nicest per­son I ever met in my life,” he said. “Look for prob­lems in other sit­u­a­tions, not in this one.”</p>
    <p>STILL PLAY­ING CATCH-UP</p>
    <p>We strug­gled a lot in the be­gin­ning (of the sea­son), for the lack of prepa­ra­tion and amount of ab­sences but even with that, we’re still alive.</p>
