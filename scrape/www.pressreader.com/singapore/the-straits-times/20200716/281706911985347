    <p>The feel­ings of peo­ple around the world about Covid-19 have shifted from fear to anger and joy as the pan­demic de­vel­oped, ac­cord­ing to a study led by Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity (NTU) that an­a­lysed 20 mil­lion tweets on Twit­ter from Jan­uary to April.</p>
    <p>The team’s find­ings re­leased yes­ter­day showed that fear was the dom­i­nant emo­tion from late Jan­uary to early March, ac­count­ing for up to half of daily tweets an­a­lysed.</p>
    <p>But that be­gan to de­cline as anger spiked in late Fe­bru­ary, peak­ing at 29 per cent of tweets on March 12, a day af­ter the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion de­clared the Covid-19 out­break a pan­demic, while the feel­ing of joy be­gan to climb slowly from late March to early April.</p>
    <p>The study, a col­lab­o­ra­tion with over­seas uni­ver­si­ties, an­a­lysed tweets in English that made ref­er­ence to the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>A ma­chine-learn­ing al­go­rithm called Crys­talFeel, de­vel­oped by the Agency for Science, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search, was used to iden­tify joy, sad­ness, fear and anger based on words or phrases.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, words such as “scared” or “panic” could have ap­peared along­side Covid-19-re­lated terms such as “con­firmed case”.</p>
    <p>These point to fears over the ini­tial un­knowns sur­round­ing the coro­n­avirus and later, the short­age of Covid-19 tests, the team said.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, xeno­pho­bia was a com­mon theme among anger-re­lated tweets at the start of the pan­demic when China was the epi­cen­tre of the out­break, with “Chi­nese peo­ple” be­ing one of the most com­mon phrases found.</p>
    <p>But the anger sub­se­quently evolved in April, the team said, with “stay home” and a va­ri­ety of swear words be­com­ing more com­mon in tweets, re­flect­ing neg­a­tive feel­ings as­so­ci­ated with iso­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The study also found an uptick in sen­ti­ments of joy re­lat­ing to na­tional pride and com­mu­nity spirit as time went on, which re­searchers said of­fered a “glim­mer of hope”.</p>
    <p>“Our find­ings sug­gest that col­lec­tive is­sues driven by emo­tions, such as shared ex­pe­ri­ences of dis­tress (dur­ing) the Covid-19 pan­demic... are de­vel­op­ing,” said team leader May O. Lwin, who chairs NTU’s Wee Kim Wee School of Com­mu­ni­ca­tion and In­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>She said wide­spread mis­trust and a be­lief in on­line false­hoods could hin­der the on­go­ing con­trol of the dis­ease, should such emo­tions not be ad­dressed through clear and de­ci­sive com­mu­ni­ca­tion by gov­ern­ments, cit­i­zen groups and so­cial me­dia stake­hold­ers. Pro­fes­sor Lwin in­tends to con­duct fol­low-up stud­ies to ex­am­ine coun­try-spe­cific trends in pub­lic emo­tions.</p>
    <p>Pre­lim­i­nary find­ings in­di­cate there has been a mod­er­ate bal­ance of pos­i­tive sen­ti­ments in Sin­ga­pore, re­lat­ing to re­silience, civic pride and cel­e­bra­tion of acts of kind­ness. This is in con­trast to other coun­tries where strong neg­a­tive emo­tions over­whelm­ingly fea­ture in so­cial me­dia posts.</p>
