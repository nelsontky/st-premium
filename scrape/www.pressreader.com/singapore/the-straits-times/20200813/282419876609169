    <p>LON­DON • Tot­ten­ham have signed Pierre-Emile Ho­jb­jerg from Southamp­ton in a re­ported £15 mil­lion (S$26.9 mil­lion) deal on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The Dan­ish mid­fielder be­came Spurs’ first sign­ing since the end of the Premier League sea­son af­ter agree­ing a five-year con­tract with the north Lon­don club.</p>
    <p>“We are de­lighted to an­nounce the sign­ing of Pierre-Emile Ho­jb­jerg from Southamp­ton,” the club said on their Twit­ter ac­count.</p>
    <p>The 25-year-old was stripped of the Saints cap­taincy and dropped for most of Southamp­ton’s post­coro­n­avirus lock­down matches af­ter he in­formed them he would not be sign­ing a new con­tract.</p>
    <p>Ever­ton were also in the hunt to sign Ho­jb­jerg, but his de­sire to work with Tot­ten­ham man­ager Jose Mour­inho is be­lieved to have helped seal his sig­na­ture.</p>
    <p>“What was very im­por­tant for me was I wanted to play at a club where I could see my­self for many years and Tot­ten­ham was the one,” said Ho­jb­jerg, who made 134 ap­pear­ances for Southamp­ton in all com­pe­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>“I al­ways like to say what­ever you put in, you get out. Spurs has fan­tas­tic play­ers, a fan­tas­tic man­ager and a fan­tas­tic set-up.”</p>
    <p>Ho­jb­jerg, who ar­rived in Eng­land in 2016 from Bay­ern Mu­nich, had been so in­tent on join­ing Tot­ten­ham that he liked sev­eral so­cial me­dia posts link­ing him with the club.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate move, Tot­ten­ham right-back Kyle Walker-Peters joined Southamp­ton for £12 mil­lion af­ter spend­ing the sec­ond half of the sea­son on loan at St Mary’s.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old Spurs acad­emy grad­u­ate has agreed a five-year deal, ahead of the new Premier League sea­son that be­gins on Sept 12.</p>
