    <p>Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics (SA) has with­drawn its de­ci­sion to ban its for­mer vice-pres­i­dent of fi­nance and part­ner­ship Poh Seng Song from hold­ing any of­fice within SA and/or its af­fil­i­ates for two con­sec­u­tive terms.</p>
    <p>This also in­cludes its rep­ri­mand and ter­mi­na­tion of the for­mer na­tional sprinter as an of­fice holder in the track and field body.</p>
    <p>In re­turn, Poh will with­draw his ap­pli­ca­tion for ju­di­cial re­view that he com­menced in the High Court against SA.</p>
    <p>These come af­ter the two sides reached an agree­ment in their months-long dis­pute fol­low­ing a me­di­a­tion ses­sion yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The squab­ble be­tween both par­ties stemmed from a Board of Inquiry (BOI) con­vened in March to look into a leak of in­for­ma­tion from the man­age­ment com­mit­tee’s (MC) What­sApp group chat.</p>
    <p>In a let­ter dated Aug 4, the MC had in­formed Poh that it “unan­i­mously agreed” with the find­ings of the BOI, which al­legedly con­cluded he was “very likely” the one who had leaked a mes­sage. It also in­formed him of the ban, rep­ri­mand and ter­mi­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Poh later said his lawyers sought to ap­peal against the BOI find­ings, and re­quested for an open ap­peal hear­ing.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the res­o­lu­tion of the mat­ter, SA pres­i­dent Tang Weng Fei said in a state­ment: “We are grate­ful to Sport Sin­ga­pore for as­sist­ing in the res­o­lu­tion of this dis­pute. The SA has al­ways been open to the idea of tak­ing all and suf­fi­cient steps to en­sure good gover­nance and where nec­es­sary, SA will re­visit its de­ci­sions with a view to trans­parency and mov­ing for­ward in pro­mot­ing the sport.</p>
    <p>“We are not in the busi­ness of com­ing to log­ger­heads with any­one and will al­ways be open to the idea of en­sur­ing fair play. While we strive hard to pro­mote the sport, we also will de­fend all mat­ters when there is a need to. But there is no ques­tion of us be­ing un­able to close out is­sues when we see it fit to do so.”</p>
    <p>In turn, Poh said: “I am pleased that par­ties have come to an am­i­ca­ble res­o­lu­tion and are able to move for­ward from here.</p>
    <p>“I thank SA pres­i­dent Tang Weng Fei for gra­ciously at­tend­ing the me­di­a­tion and un­der­stand­ing my side of the story.”</p>
    <p>Both par­ties thanked the me­di­a­tor Chia Chor Leong and their re­spec­tive coun­sel for their as­sis­tance and guid­ance.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to The Straits Times’ queries on what led to the about­turn, Tang said: “SA took a de­ci­sion based on what was be­fore SA at that time. If you note, Seng Song did not take part in the SA ma­chin­ery.</p>
    <p>“At to­day’s me­di­a­tion, he was present and with the ben­e­fit of a healthy ex­change, SA took the de­ci­sion most suit­able for both par­ties.”</p>
    <p>Tang did not com­ment on whether SA still held Poh cul­pa­ble for the leak, cit­ing the con­fi­den­tial na­ture of the me­di­a­tion.</p>
    <p>We are not in the busi­ness of com­ing to log­ger­heads with any­one and will al­ways be open to the idea of en­sur­ing fair play. ’’</p>
    <p>TANG WENG FEI, Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>I am pleased that par­ties have come to an am­i­ca­ble res­o­lu­tion and are able to move for­ward from here. ’’</p>
    <p>POH SENG SONG, for­mer SA vice-pres­i­dent of fi­nance and part­ner­ship.</p>
