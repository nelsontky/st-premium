    <p>Noth­ing makes Mr Zhai Dong prouder than see­ing his work be­ing used and en­joyed by the public.</p>
    <p>“See­ing the build­ings that I’ve worked on ben­e­fit­ting so­ci­ety makes my job very re­ward­ing,” says the op­er­a­tions man­ager at China Jinye En­gi­neer­ing Cor­po­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>The list of developmen­ts he has worked on in­clude Universal Stu­dios Sin­ga­pore, One Can­berra Ex­ec­u­tive Con­do­minium and The Poiz Res­i­dences. The en­gi­neer cur­rently over­sees dif­fer­ent teams that build re­in­forced con­crete (RC) and steel struc­tures for com­mer­cial and res­i­den­tial projects. Some of his re­cently com­pleted projects in­clude the In­sti­tute of Sys­tems Sci­ence at Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore and Queens Peak con­do­minium, which was com­pleted last month.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhai joined the com­pany as an en­gi­neer in 2009. He has since moved up the ranks to take on big­ger roles and re­spon­si­bil­i­ties as a zone man­ager, ma­te­rial man­ager and steel struc­ture spe­cial­ist.</p>
    <p>In his cur­rent role as an op­er­a­tions man­ager in the com­pany’s man­power and spe­cial­ist depart­ment, he over­sees the man­age­ment of labour, pro­duc­tiv­ity, qual­ity con­trol and safety mea­sures of 10 teams, which in­clude RC and steel struc­ture spe­cial­ist teams and pro­ject teams.</p>
    <p>A firm be­liever in skills up­grad­ing, Mr Zhai has at­tended cour­ses to stay up to date with the latest trends in the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>He ex­plains that ac­quir­ing new skills and knowl­edge will en­able him to con­struct bet­ter build­ings while be­ing more pro­duc­tive with his time.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, get­ting cer­ti­fied as a Green Mark Ac­cred­ited</p>
    <p>See­ing the build­ings that I've worked on ben­e­fit­ting so­ci­ety makes my job very re­ward­ing.</p>
    <p>MR ZHAI DONG, op­er­a­tions man­ager, China Jinye En­gi­neer­ing Cor­po­ra­tion</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sional last year has l ed him to un­der­stand how to eval­u­ate and select so­lu­tions to de­velop sus­tain­able build­ings ac­cord­ing to the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity’ s guide­lines. He is also cer­ti­fied in a soft­ware called Build­ing In­for­ma­tion Mod­el­ling that en­ables him to cre­ate dig­i­tal ren­der­ings of struc­tures be­fore they are built, as well as pro­ject man­age­ment safety and un­der­ground con­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>Other than ac­quir­ing tech­ni­cal skills, Mr Zhai has had plenty of op­por­tu­ni­ties to hone soft skills such as com­mu­ni­ca­tion and cre­ative think­ing while lead­ing projects.</p>
    <p>In the con­struc­tion sec­tor, ev­ery de­ci­sion made at each stage of the work­flow would im­pact time­lines and pro­ject out­comes. He has to earn the re­spect of his team, as well as be or­gan­ised and clear in his com­mu­ni­ca­tion so as to mo­ti­vate t hem to achieve mile­stones.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing a deep un­der­stand­ing of the in­dus­try gives us an edge,” he adds. “This is why I al­ways share my knowl­edge with my team mem­bers and part­ners. At the same time, I am learn­ing from them.”</p>
