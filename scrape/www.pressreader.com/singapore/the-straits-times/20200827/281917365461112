    <p>LON­DON • UK judges can set global roy­alty rates for the use of telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy, Bri­tain’s high­est court said in a pair of cases over how much Huawei Tech­nolo­gies owes a US patent owner.</p>
    <p>The United King­dom Supreme Court yes­ter­day af­firmed a de­ci­sion that Huawei would ei­ther have to pay Un­wired Planet In­ter­na­tional a global rate set by judges or face an or­der lim­it­ing its Bri­tish sales.</p>
    <p>In a re­lated de­ci­sion in­volv­ing an­other patent owner, the court re­jected Huawei and ZTE Corp’s ar­gu­ment that, if any court were to es­tab­lish a global rate, it should be in China, where man­u­fac­tur­ing and the bulk of sales are lo­cated.</p>
    <p>Un­wired Planet and Con­ver­sant Wire­less Li­cens­ing each have patents re­lated to the 2G, 3G, and 4G telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions stan­dards.</p>
    <p>Un­wired Planet is seek­ing roy­al­ties on Huawei’s phones and in­fra­struc­ture, while Con­ver­sant con­tends it is en­ti­tled to roy­al­ties from both Huawei and ZTE.</p>
    <p>Huawei and ZTE were chal­leng­ing rul­ings that would ef­fec­tively make Bri­tish courts a one-stop shop to set global roy­alty rates.</p>
    <p>Since the orig­i­nal rul­ing, the coun­try’s tri­bunals have be­come in­creas­ingly pop­u­lar. The “de­ci­sion makes the UK one of the lead­ing global ju­ris­dic­tions for the res­o­lu­tion of such dis­putes”, EIP, one of the law firms rep­re­sent­ing the patent hold­ers, said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Huawei did not im­me­di­ately re­turn a mes­sage seek­ing com­ment.</p>
    <p>The cases have pit­ted the own­ers of patents on stan­dard­ised tech­nol­ogy, in­clud­ing Qualcomm Inc and Eric­s­son, against those who use the sys­tems in their prod­ucts, such as Ap­ple Inc. It is a thorny is­sue that is be­com­ing more im­por­tant as the world tran­si­tions to the next gen­er­a­tion of wire­less tech­nol­ogy known as 5G.</p>
