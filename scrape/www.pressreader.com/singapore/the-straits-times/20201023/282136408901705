    <p>There will be a to­tal of 1,000 train­ing slots, com­pany at­tach­ments as well as trainee­ship op­por­tu­ni­ties of­fered in the maritime sec­tor to Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>They will be in ar­eas such as au­to­ma­tion sys­tems, dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion, ship­ping op­er­a­tions and maritime su­per­in­ten­dency.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the 10th Sin­ga­pore Maritime In­sti­tute Fo­rum yes­ter­day, Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Trans­port and For­eign Af­fairs Chee Hong Tat said the open­ings re­flect skills in de­mand in the in­dus­try, adding that these skills can ben­e­fit trainees if they later de­cide to join other sec­tors.</p>
    <p>“Our maritime sec­tor is not only re­silient, it is ac­tu­ally grow­ing from strength to strength dur­ing this pan­demic. This is the chal­lenge we have set for our­selves... how to grow Maritime Sin­ga­pore and cre­ate more good jobs,” said Mr Chee.</p>
    <p>“Be­sides cre­at­ing new jobs, we must also help our peo­ple to de­velop the skills to take on these jobs.”</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, the Govern­ment said there were 200 open­ings in the sec­tor. Yes­ter­day, Mr Chee an­nounced an additional 800 places.</p>
    <p>The Maritime and Port Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MPA) is part­ner­ing Skill­sFu­ture Sin­ga­pore (SSG), Work­force Sin­ga­pore, the Sin­ga­pore Ship­ping As­so­ci­a­tion, maritime com­pa­nies and in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing to pro­vide the op­por­tu­ni­ties un­der the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Ini­tia­tive, the or­gan­i­sa­tions said in a joint state­ment.</p>
    <p>MPA and SSG are also col­lab­o­rat­ing with some in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing and maritime play­ers on train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties through the SGUnited Skills Pro­gramme and SGUnited Mid-Ca­reer Path­ways – Com­pany Train­ing Pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s fo­rum, held at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, fo­cused on the fu­ture of port and ship­ping.</p>
    <p>In his speech, Mr Chee said Covid-19 has greatly dis­rupted many sec­tors glob­ally and changed peo­ple’s way of life. How­ever, Sin­ga­pore’s maritime sec­tor has re­mained re­silient.</p>
    <p>He added: “As sup­ply chains shift and be­come more com­plex, due to Covid-19 and other global de­vel­op­ments, we must be ready to adapt and re­main rel­e­vant.”</p>
    <p>Among other things, the sec­tor must em­brace dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion, which is fun­da­men­tally chang­ing busi­ness mod­els and pro­cesses across dif­fer­ent sec­tors, said Mr Chee, who also em­pha­sised the im­por­tance of global col­lab­o­ra­tion in the sec­tor in ar­eas such as au­to­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>He added that the pur­suit of de­car­bon­i­sa­tion will change the face of maritime, such as the type of marine fuel used, the de­sign of ves­sels, and how port in­fra­struc­ture and op­er­a­tions are or­gan­ised.</p>
    <p>Mr Chee noted that Sin­ga­pore, as the world’s largest trans­ship­ment hub and a ma­jor maritime cen­tre, will do its part in the fight against cli­mate change by sup­port­ing the In­ter­na­tional Maritime Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s emis­sions tar­gets.</p>
    <p>“We do not be­lieve that be­ing a place that is ‘busi­ness friendly’ is at odds with be­ing ‘en­vi­ron­men­tally friendly’,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that the Govern­ment will also pro­vide a reg­u­la­tory en­vi­ron­ment that sup­ports busi­ness and in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>“When we suc­ceed in at­tain­ing sus­tain­able growth, we can also achieve other im­por­tant out­comes like cre­at­ing good jobs for our work­ers and putting in place in­dus­try prac­tices that pro­tect the en­vi­ron­ment.”</p>
    <p>At the event, Mr Chee also launched two re­search and de­vel­op­ment ini­tia­tives by the Cen­tre of Ex­cel­lence in Mod­el­ling and Sim­u­la­tion for Next Gen­er­a­tion Ports, to cre­ate dig­i­tal mod­els of ports for port au­thor­i­ties and op­er­a­tors to test so­lu­tions for dif­fer­ent op­er­at­ing sce­nar­ios.</p>
