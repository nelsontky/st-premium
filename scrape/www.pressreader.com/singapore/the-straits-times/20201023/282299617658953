    <p>• Bay­ern Munich coach Hansi Flick praised his team’s ef­fi­ciency fol­low­ing Wed­nes­day’s 4-0 de­mo­li­tion of Atletico Madrid in their Cham­pi­ons League Group A opener.</p>
    <p>The Spa­niards were no match for the quin­tu­ple win­ners, who took con­trol of the game from the start and never al­lowed their op­po­nents a look-in as they launched their ti­tle de­fence with a re­sound­ing win.</p>
    <p>“Our game was just good tonight,” Flick, who could not field Serge Gnabry after the Ger­many winger be­came the club’s first coro­n­avirus case the pre­vi­ous day, told re­porters. “It was a tough task but we mas­tered it. Our ef­fi­ciency was good today and I am very sat­is­fied. It is very im­por­tant to win that first game.”</p>
    <p>Bay­ern won their sixth Euro­pean Cup in Au­gust and de­spite a shorter pre-sea­son, showed no lack of de­sire and hunger against an Atletico side known for their de­fen­sive shape and team­work.</p>
    <p>“We were phys­i­cally present. That was im­por­tant, to be there, to win those one-on-one sit­u­a­tions. We had a match plan and we ap­plied it, play­ing out four beau­ti­ful goals,” Flick said. “We can be sat­is­fied with it and that is what mat­ters. We re­ally, re­ally wanted to win the first game today.”</p>
    <p>Bay­ern, who have won their last 12 Cham­pi­ons League games, were clin­i­cal, with Kings­ley Co­man scor­ing twice and Corentin Tolisso and Leon Goret­zka also on tar­get. Co­man, whose header set­tled l ast sea­son’s fi­nal against Paris Saint-Ger­main, was out­stand­ing. The France winger as­sisted the sec­ond goal as they handed out Atletico’s joint-heav­i­est de­feat un­der Diego Sime­one.</p>
    <p>“The winning goal in last sea­son’s fi­nal is a good mo­ti­va­tor, but it’s in the past now and we have fresh goals this sea­son,” he said.</p>
