    <p>Cer­tifi­cate of en­ti­tle­ment (COE) pre­mi­ums ended mostly higher in the lat­est ten­der yes­ter­day, the last one be­fore the next three-month quota starts in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>The COE price for cars up to 1,600cc and 130bhp fin­ished at $37,334, 2.2 per cent higher than the pre­vi­ous premium two weeks ago. The premium for cars above 1,600cc or 130bhp closed 0.7 per cent higher at $40,990.</p>
    <p>The price for the Open COE, which can be used for any ve­hi­cle type ex­cept motorcycle­s but ends up pre­dom­i­nantly for big­ger cars, ended 1 per cent lower at $39,889.</p>
    <p>The premium for the com­mer­cial ve­hi­cle COE, which has been trend­ing at its high­est in over two years, rose by another 2.1 per cent to reach $33,778. The mo­tor­cy­cle premium was 2 per cent lower at $7,300.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try watch­ers reckon the rise in the COE price for cars up to 1,600cc can be at­trib­uted to a smaller sup­ply of cer­tifi­cates in the new quota start­ing next month.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the sup­ply of COEs for the other two cat­e­gories used for cars will be larger, which may ex­plain the dip in the premium for the Open cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Ve­hi­cle Traders As­so­ci­a­tion pres­i­dent Ed­die Loo said the re­sults were within ex­pec­ta­tions, but “we thought Cat­e­gory B (cars above 1,600cc) would fall” be­cause of the big­ger quota next month.</p>
    <p>He said the fact that the Open cat­e­gory price fell showed “the spec­u­la­tive com­po­nent was ab­sent”. Mo­tor deal­ers of­ten se­cure Open COEs in an­tic­i­pa­tion of higher pre­mi­ums down the road.</p>
    <p>In the case of Cat­e­gory A (cars up to 1,600cc), Mr Loo said pre­vail­ing pre­mi­ums “do not re­ally re­flect sen­ti­ment” of the masses. “A lot of lux­ury cars are in this cat­e­gory, which is sup­posed to cater to econ­omy car buy­ers,” he said, adding that sell­ers of econ­omy cars can­not com­pete with those sell­ing lux­ury cars, which usu­ally have far fat­ter profit mar­gins.</p>
    <p>Look­ing ahead, he said bid­ding should heat up as com­pe­ti­tion in­creases with the tra­di­tional yearend rush to meet sales tar­gets.</p>
