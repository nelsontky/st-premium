    <p>In his first New Year mes­sage since be­com­ing the Leader of the Op­po­si­tion, Work­ers’ Party (WP) chief Pri­tam Singh pledged that his party will con­tinue to cham­pion ro­bust pol­icy al­ter­na­tives that rep­re­sent the needs of Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>The WP will also con­tinue in its mod­er­ate path so as to pro­vide a trusted al­ter­na­tive to vot­ers and act as a balanc­ing force in Sin­ga­pore’s po­lit­i­cal sys­tem, he said on Thurs­day in a mes­sage is­sued to the me­dia.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh was made Leader of the Op­po­si­tion af­ter his party won the Alju­nied and Sengkang group rep­re­sen­ta­tion con­stituen­cies and sin­gle-seat Hougang in the July 10 Gen­eral Elec­tion held amid the pan­demic – a first for any op­po­si­tion party since in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong, in an­nounc­ing the new role, had said the elec­tion re­sults showed a de­sire for a di­ver­sity of voices in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Thank­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans for their sup­port, Mr Singh said in his mes­sage: “We also ap­pre­ci­ate the sup­port shown to the Work­ers’ Party this GE2020, and along­side it, the weight of re­spon­si­bil­ity and hard work needed to earn your trust as we strive to­wards bal­anced and plu­ral politics for Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>He noted that in the last year, the WP had made sug­ges­tions on min­i­mum wage, widen­ing ac­cess to jus­tice, and op­ti­mis­ing Sin­ga­pore’s re­serves, among other things.</p>
    <p>WP MPs, mem­bers and vol­un­teers have also en­gaged Sin­ga­pore­ans through di­a­logues and other ac­tiv­i­ties and pro­vided in­ter­ven­tion and sup­port to the less for­tu­nate, he said, adding that the party would con­tinue to sup­port Sin­ga­pore­ans “to the fullest ex­tent pos­si­ble” with ap­peals, ad­vice and aid.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has dis­rupted liveli­hoods and cast a shadow of fear and un­cer­tainty over so­ci­ety, Mr Singh noted.</p>
    <p>The new year “will not be a bed of roses”, he said, es­pe­cially as some sec­tors of the econ­omy have still not re­cov­ered and some peo­ple have lost their jobs or taken pay cuts.</p>
    <p>But he added that the cir­cu­la­tion of Covid-19 vac­cines is an en­cour­ag­ing de­vel­op­ment and a re­mark­able achieve­ment for the world.</p>
    <p>“It is also a keen re­minder that Sin­ga­pore must re­main a responsibl­e con­trib­u­tor to the global or­der, so as to ben­e­fit from it,” he said.</p>
    <p>End­ing his mes­sage with a wish for suc­cess, good health and peace to Sin­ga­pore­ans, he said: “As we move into 2021, I want to salute the resilience and so­cial unity shown by Sin­ga­pore­ans over the past year. We have weath­ered this storm, and I am proud to be a mem­ber of a united peo­ple that will con­tinue to stand firm in the face of the storms that lie ahead of us.”</p>
