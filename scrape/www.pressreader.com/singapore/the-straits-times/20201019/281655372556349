    <p>CLEVE­LAND (Ohio) • Trump signs are ev­ery­where. A big flag with a dra­matic de­pic­tion of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump mus­cled up like Rambo, jaw set, clad in a black sin­glet, tot­ing a grenade launcher, hangs from the win­dow of a ram­shackle sin­gle-storey house.</p>
    <p>Grafton vil­lage is a smat­ter­ing of cheap pre­fab houses and sec­ond­hand and bro­ken cars, roughly an hour from the cor­niced tow­ers of down­town Cleve­land. It has a poverty rate of around 10 per cent – and that is among its ma­jor­ity (65.67 per cent) white pop­u­la­tion. There is a lo­cal pen­i­ten­tiary which pops up when you search for Grafton on Google Maps.</p>
    <p>This is part of Mr Trump’s bedrock solid base, in a bell­wether state with­out which no Repub­li­can can­di­date has ever won the White House.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Trump car­ried Ohio by eight points in 2016, af­ter the state had twice in a row voted for Mr Barack Obama. It is blue-col­lar Amer­i­cans like those in Grafton, Lord­stown and the Ap­palachian min­ing coun­try – but also con­ser­va­tives in wealthy dis­tricts – that pow­ered Mr Trump to vic­tory in a state which has 18 Elec­toral Col­lege votes.</p>
    <p>On a main road near Grafton, a young man with a beard man­ning a stall sell­ing Trump-Pence mer­chan­dise jumps out of the way of a pho­to­graph. An­other young man, also with a big beard, and wear­ing what looks like a sheathed knife at his belt, is hold­ing sev­eral “Drain the Swamp” signs. He too backs out of the pic­ture.</p>
    <p>And in Grafton, among the ram­shackle homes, a bald man, bearded and bare-chested, shouts bel­liger­ently: “Hey, are you pho­tograph­ing my house?”</p>
    <p>In his po­lit­i­cal news­let­ter Crys­tal Ball, Univer­sity of Vir­ginia pro­fes­sor of pol­i­tics Larry Sa­bato said: “Ohio should vote con­sid­er­ably to the right of the na­tion, thanks to its high per­cent­age of white vot­ers who don’t have a four-year col­lege de­gree – a strong group for Trump.”</p>
    <p>The 2018 midterms saw the</p>
    <p>Democrats mak­ing up some ground, but the Repub­li­can Party re­mains strong in ru­ral and post-in­dus­trial Ohio. Lat­est polls, how­ever, show Demo­cratic Party can­di­date J oe Bi­den and Pres­i­dent Trump vir­tu­ally neck and neck. This time around, Ohio is a toss-up.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think every­body’s com­ing home, but I think a lot of peo­ple are,” Demo­crat Con­gress­man Tim Ryan told The Wash­ing­ton Post. “Af­ter Covid, peo­ple are call­ing out his (Mr Trump’s) lead­er­ship skills. There’s a path here.”</p>
    <p>There are warn­ing signs cer­tainly for the Pres­i­dent. One sign out­side the sprawl­ing auto plant in Lord­stown that Gen­eral Mo­tors closed in 2016 says “Dump Trump”.</p>
    <p>The plant, bought by Lord­stown Mo­tors which plans to man­u­fac­ture an elec­tri­cal pickup truck, has not em­ployed the many hun­dreds that once worked the assem­bly lines here.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics point to it as ev­i­dence of false prom­ises.</p>
    <p>And even in the up­mar­ket sub­urb of re­li­ably Repub­li­can Brecksvill­e, there are the odd Bi­den-Har­ris yard signs – and one large “Black Lives Mat­ter” sign.</p>
    <p>“We have to get him out of there,” said re­tired chem­i­cal en­gi­neer Robert Page, 69, an in­de­pen­dent voter.</p>
    <p>“I think it’s prob­a­bly the most im­por­tant elec­tion since the civil war,” he told The Straits Times. “Ba­si­cally once he is re-elected he will do any­thing he wants; there are no bars.”</p>
    <p>Chair­man of the city’s School Board Fred Ped­er­sen, 73, laments how Amer­ica’s in­ter­na­tional im­age has suf­fered.</p>
    <p>A re­cent Pew Re­search poll of sev­eral ad­vanced coun­tries found that most had a lower opin­ion of Pres­i­dent Trump than of Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping of China.</p>
    <p>“When he took of­fice, the Pres­i­dent of the United States was the leader of the world,” Mr Ped­er­sen told ST. “That is no longer the case.”</p>
    <p>“I don’t think he is a role model for any­body… I be­lieve as the leader of our coun­try, as Pres­i­dent of the United States, he’s been a fail­ure.”</p>
    <p>But then there is Hun­gar­ian im­mi­grant Pe­tra Las­zlo, a 38-year-old mother of four mar­ried to a fam­ily doc­tor who is also of Hun­gar­ian an­ces­try, who ap­pre­ci­ates Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>“I ap­pre­ci­ate his cap­i­tal­ism. My fam­ily moved to the United States (when I was eight) right af­ter the col­lapse of com­mu­nism in Hun­gary,” she said.</p>
    <p>Reve­la­tions by a long New York Times in­ves­ti­ga­tion of Mr Trump that he has paid lit­tle or no in­come tax, are wa­ter un­der the bridge.</p>
    <p>“What I fo­cus on more is that he left a life of com­fort... to be in the White House.”</p>
    <p>But ob­serv­ing the in­tol­er­ance on ei­ther side of the po­lit­i­cal spec­trum, she is wor­ried like many, fear­ing a civil war. “It does seem like a per­fect storm,” she said.</p>
