    <p>• Lionel Messi beat Pele’s record of goals for a sin­gle club when he scored his 644th for Barcelona in a 3-0 Span­ish La Liga vic­tory over Val­ladolid on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The Ar­gentina skip­per scored Barca’s third goal when he col­lected Pedri’s back-heel be­fore fir­ing past goal­keeper Jordi Masip in the 65th minute.</p>
    <p>“When I started play­ing football I never thought I would break any records. And even less the one I achieved to­day,” Messi posted on In­sta­gram shortly af­ter the game.</p>
    <p>“I can only thank all those who helped me over the years, my team­mates, my fam­ily, my friends and all those who sup­port me ev­ery day.”</p>
    <p>Messi, who is Barca’s record goalscorer, had equalled Pele on Satur­day in a 2-2 draw with Va­len­cia, with both play­ers net­ting at al­most an equal rate for their clubs.</p>
    <p>It was the 33-year-old’s 749th com­pet­i­tive match for Barca, mean­ing he has scored a goal ev­ery 1.16 games. The Brazil l egend scored 643 goals in 757 matches with San­tos, where he played from 1956 to 1974, or one ev­ery 1.17 matches.</p>
    <p>Six-time Bal­lon d’Or win­ner Messi – with 10 goals in all com­pe­ti­tions and five be­ing penal­ties – is enduring his worst in­di­vid­ual sea­son since 2007-08. How­ever, Barca coach Ron­ald Koe­man is hop­ing that by switch­ing to an un­fa­mil­iar 3-5-2 for­ma­tion, he can free up his cap­tain in at­tack­ing ar­eas.</p>
    <p>De­spite drop­ping An­toine Griez­mann and Philippe Coutinho, the vis­i­tors dom­i­nated at Val­ladolid and the Dutch­man, whose side also scored via Cle­ment Len­glet and Martin Braith­waite, hopes they can build on the away win, their first in the league since Oct 1.</p>
    <p>Koe­man said: “I see Messi happy. He is work­ing hard, and he is a very im­por­tant part of our at­tack­ing game.</p>
    <p>“For this game, we changed our for­ma­tion to give us more se­cu­rity at the back and make the most of the qual­ity of our full-backs.</p>
    <p>“At the same time, we were able to build plays with­out any prob­lems, and have lots of pos­ses­sion and play­ers run­ning between the lines. We saw a team that meant busi­ness, that showed good con­cen­tra­tion, and we cre­ated a lot of op­por­tu­ni­ties.”</p>
    <p>Barca re­main eight points be­hind lead­ers Atletico Madrid (32), who won 2-0 at third-placed Real So­ciedad (26) on Tues­day, and have also played a game more.</p>
