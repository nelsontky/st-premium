    <p>Af­ter nearly nine months of ask­ing to be “put in a par­cel” and sent from Jo­hor to re­unite with her par­ents across the Causeway, Reiko Cheah fi­nally ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore at the end of last month.</p>
    <p>But the four-year-old, ac­com­pa­nied by her father Kenny Cheah dur­ing a manda­tory 14-day quar­an­tine, found her­self still sep­a­rated from her mother Sylvia Chong, whom she could only wave at from four floors up in a ho­tel and be­hind the glass win­dow of its room where she was serv­ing her stay­home no­tice.</p>
    <p>“They were cry­ing to each other on the phone, say­ing ‘so near yet so far’. And when my wife came to</p>
    <p>pick us up two weeks later, they ran to each other and started cry­ing again... very dra­matic,” a chuck­ling Mr Cheah re­counted to The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>On the same day that his fam­ily of five – in­clud­ing his sons Ni­cholas, 13, and Devin, eight – were brought to­gether again, the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment brought back more than 30 chil­dren who, like Reiko, had been left in Malaysia as Covid-19 travel re­stric­tions came into ef­fect in March.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs (MFA) said it has brought back more than 350 Sin­ga­pore­ans across the Causeway since March.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that the Dec 13 repa­tri­a­tion op­er­a­tion was a “larger than usual” ex­er­cise, For­eign Min­is­ter Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan wrote on Face­book that pub­lic of­fi­cers “have been work­ing hard be­hind the scenes... with lit­tle fan­fare”, to re­unite loved ones.</p>
    <p>“They are among the un­seen he­roes dur­ing this cri­sis,” added Dr Balakr­ish­nan.</p>
    <p>For MFA con­sular of­fi­cer Tay Woon Min, it was sim­ply about an­swer­ing a call for as­sis­tance from</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans. “Some Sin­ga­porean par­ents with fam­i­lies in Malaysia had made the dif­fi­cult de­ci­sion to leave their young chil­dren be­hind in Malaysia then,” she said.</p>
    <p>“But as the bor­der clo­sure was fur­ther ex­tended, they be­came in­creas­ingly anx­ious about when they could be re­united with their chil­dren, whom they had not seen for months. (The chil­dren) needed our help to re­turn (to Sin­ga­pore).” Reiko was one of them.</p>
    <p>Said the 35-year-old Mr Cheah: “With all the dif­fer­ent lock­downs and cir­cuit breaker, it was just day af­ter day of be­ing un­sure over what to do for Reiko. We called her every day, and she would keep say­ing how she wants her dad and mum.”</p>
    <p>In pre-Covid-19 days, the mar­ket­ing man­ager and his wife, who is self-em­ployed, lived in Sin­ga­pore with their two sons who at­tend school here. Their week­ends were spent cross­ing the Causeway to visit their daugh­ter, who was cared for by Mr Cheah’s mother in Jo­hor.</p>
    <p>When the fam­ily, who are Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dents, fi­nally de­cided to bring Reiko over in Oc­to­ber, Mr Cheah con­tacted Sin­ga­pore’s Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Au­thor­ity, which has been work­ing with MFA on weekly op­er­a­tions since April to bring mi­nors over from Jo­hor.</p>
    <p>Mr Cheah said the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties went to an “amaz­ing ex­tent” to get his daugh­ter back with the fam­ily. This in­cluded se­cur­ing ap­proval from Malaysia’s im­mi­gra­tion agency to have his mother take Reiko to the Jo­hor check­point; hav­ing two of­fi­cers drive him there to pick her up; and get­ting a bus to take them to their as­signed quar­an­tine ho­tel – Capri by Fraser, China Square.</p>
    <p>Such op­er­a­tions re­quire the co­or­di­na­tion of mul­ti­ple other agen­cies such as the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity and Trans­port and Health min­istries. But for MFA vice-con­sul (ad­min and con­sular) Ka­mar Faizal Ba­haram, the big­gest chal­lenge of the larger-scale repa­tri­a­tion this month was man­ag­ing the wor­ried par­ents.</p>
    <p>“(We) helped to make sure all their doc­u­ments were in order and that they fol­lowed in­struc­tions,” he ex­plained. “This was time-con­sum­ing, but cru­cial for the suc­cess of the op­er­a­tion and safety of ev­ery­one in­volved.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ka­mar also said that on Dec 13, they de­cided to switch to a smaller bus so par­ents with young chil­dren would not have to climb up to the up­per deck of a larger ve­hi­cle that was orig­i­nally char­tered.</p>
    <p>“The smiles and warm hugs at the re­unions made all the hard work worth­while,” said Ms Tay, his MFA col­league.</p>
    <p>In his Face­book post, Dr Balakr­ish­nan wrote: “It’s a spe­cial priv­i­lege to wel­come the new year, and at­ten­dant hopes and as­pi­ra­tions, to­gether as a fam­ily.”</p>
    <p>Mr Cheah agrees. Reiko will stay put in Sin­ga­pore for the fore­see­able fu­ture – for it is the abil­ity to do the sim­plest of ac­tiv­i­ties to­gether, as a com­plete fam­ily unit, that mat­ters most to Mr Cheah now.</p>
    <p>“The first thing we did was to have a meal. Our first out­ing was to Be­dok Reser­voir, for the kids to just run about and blow bub­bles,” he said. “For the new year, we will go to Or­chard Road to walk around. Noth­ing much... but it will be nice.”</p>
