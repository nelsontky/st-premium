    <p>In the now-dis­tant Repub­li­can pres­i­den­tial pri­maries of 2016, Sen­a­tor Ted Cruz of Texas hand­ily won the Iowa cau­cuses. This was de­ter­mined by a method that has lately come un­der at­tack but at the time was con­sid­ered stan­dard – el­e­men­tary maths.</p>
    <p>One of the losers in Iowa, de­vel­oper and TV per­son­al­ity Don­ald Trump, soon ac­cused Mr Cruz of elec­toral theft. He fired off sev­eral in­flam­ma­tory tweets, in­clud­ing this fore­shad­ow­ing of our cur­rent democ­racy-test­ing mo­ment: “Based on the fraud com­mit­ted by Sen­a­tor Ted Cruz dur­ing the Iowa cau­cus, ei­ther a new elec­tion should take place or Cruz re­sults nul­li­fied.”</p>
    <p>The episode van­ished in the tsunami of po­lit­i­cal vit­riol to come dur­ing the Trump pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>Still, it re­flects what those who have worked with Mr Trump say is his modus operandi when try­ing to slip the hu­mil­i­at­ing ep­i­thet he has so read­ily ap­plied to oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Loser.</p>
    <p>“The first thing he calls some­one who has wronged him is a loser,” said Mr Jack O’Don­nell, who ran an At­lantic City casino for Mr Trump in the 1980s. “That’s his main at­tack word. The worst thing in his world would be to be a loser. To avoid be­ing called a loser, he will do or say any­thing.”</p>
    <p>Across his long ca­reer, he has spun, cajoled and at­tacked – in the press, in law­suits and lately, of course, on Twitter – when­ever faced with ap­pear­ing as any­thing less than the su­perla­tive of the mo­ment: the great­est, the smartest, the health­i­est, the best.</p>
    <p>This has at times re­quired au­da­cious at­tempts to twist a neg­a­tive into a pos­i­tive, of­ten by say­ing some­thing over and over un­til it ei­ther dis­places the truth or ex­hausts the au­di­ence into sur­ren­der.</p>
    <p>It is a mat­ter of record that Mr Trump has been a loser in many busi­ness ven­tures (Trump Steaks, any­one?). In fact, his great­est suc­cess flowed not from real es­tate</p>
    <p>but from the cre­ation of a pop­u­lar al­ter­nate-re­al­ity tele­vi­sion per­sona – Trump, mas­ter of the board­room – that he ul­ti­mately rode to the White House.</p>
    <p>But his fa­mous aver­sion to the la­bel of loser has now reached its apoth­e­o­sis.</p>
    <p>Since Mr Joe Bi­den was de­clared the win­ner of the Nov 3 elec­tion – and Mr Trump there­fore de­clared the loser – the Pres­i­dent has re­peat­edly traf­ficked in base­less al­le­ga­tions of a fraud­u­lent and cor­rupt elec­toral process.</p>
    <p>What was once con­sid­ered the quirky trait of a self-in­volved New York de­vel­oper has be­come an in­ter­na­tional em­bar­rass­ment, nearly up­end­ing the sa­cred tran­si­tion of power and leav­ing the world’s lead­ing democ­racy – grap­pling with a deadly pan­demic and a tee­ter­ing econ­omy – with a leader who re­fuses to con­cede de­spite the ba­sic maths.</p>
    <p>“AND I WON THE ELEC­TION,” Mr Trump tweeted on Nov 18.</p>
    <p>“VOTER FRAUD ALL OVER THE COUN­TRY.”</p>
    <p>Last Monday, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion fi­nally au­tho­rised a weeks-de­layed tran­si­tion process af­ter Michi­gan cer­ti­fied Mr Bi­den as its win­ner. Still, Mr Trump con­tin­ued to press quixotic law­suits and tweets of fraud and de­fi­ant resolve. “Our case STRONGLY con­tin­ues, we will keep up the good fight.”</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent’s tweets have suc­ceeded in sow­ing doubt about the foun­da­tional un­der­pin­nings of the repub­lic among his many mil­lions of fol­low­ers. In a re­cent Reuters/lp­sos poll, about half the Repub­li­cans ques­tioned be­lieved that Mr Trump had “right­fully won” re-elec­tion, and 68 per cent ex­pressed con­cern that the elec­tion was “rigged”.</p>
    <p>A BI­NARY AP­PROACH TO LIFE</p>
    <p>Such be­hav­iour by the Pres­i­dent re­flects a bi­nary ap­proach to life that spares no room for nuance or</p>
    <p>com­pli­ca­tion. If a per­son isn’t a one, then that per­son is a zero.</p>
    <p>“You are ei­ther a win­ner or a loser,” said Michael Co­hen, Mr Trump’s for­mer lawyer and fixer, in an in­ter­view ear­lier this month. “Re­al­ity is sec­ondary. It is all about per­cep­tion.”</p>
    <p>Co­hen, who was con­victed in 2018 of tax eva­sion and cam­paign fi­nance vi­o­la­tions and who has since be­come a vo­cal critic of the Pres­i­dent, pro­vided sev­eral ex­am­ples in his re­cent book, Dis­loyal: A Mem­oir.</p>
    <p>He re­counted how, in 2014, CNBC was pre­par­ing a poll of the 25 most in­flu­en­tial peo­ple in the world. Mr Trump, who ini­tially ranked 187th out of 200, or­dered Co­hen to im­prove his stand­ing. “Just make sure I make it to the top 10,” Mr Trump said, ac­cord­ing to</p>
    <p>Co­hen, who hired some­one to as­sess the op­tions.</p>
    <p>Af­ter that per­son de­ter­mined that the poll could be ma­nip­u­lated, US$15,000 was spent to buy</p>
    <p>dis­creet IP ad­dresses through which votes for Mr Trump could be cast. The scheme worked, with Mr Trump el­e­vated to ninth place when all the votes were counted.</p>
    <p>But CNBC re­moved him from the list without ex­pla­na­tion. The in­fu­ri­ated Mr Trump or­dered Co­hen to get the net­work to change course. This failed. He then or­dered him to plant a story in the me­dia about “the ter­ri­ble treat­ment Trump had re­ceived at the hands of CNBC”. This also failed.</p>
    <p>Still, Mr Trump man­aged to ex­ploit the fake rank­ing be­fore he was dropped from the list.</p>
    <p>FROM BUILD­ING BLOCKS TO TAJ MA­HAL</p>
    <p>This fear of be­ing seen as some­how less than the very best is a re­cur­ring theme in the moun­tains of books and ar­ti­cles writ­ten about Mr Trump. In his own book, Trump: The Art Of The Deal, he re­called glu­ing to­gether the blocks of his younger brother</p>
    <p>Robert, ef­fec­tively en­sur­ing that he would not be out­done in any com­pe­ti­tion in­volv­ing... blocks.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Mr O’Don­nell, Mr Trump pushed to have his Taj Ma­hal casino open pre­ma­turely in 1990 be­cause he feared the shame a de­lay would bring af­ter promis­ing the world a glitzy, celebrity-packed open­ing.</p>
    <p>The casino wasn’t ready. Among other is­sues, only one-quar­ter of the slot ma­chines were open, leav­ing the cav­ernous space quiet and empty. Pri­vately, Mr Trump was fu­ri­ous and blamed his brother Robert for some of the prob­lems. Pub­licly, though, he boasted of the won­der that was the Taj Ma­hal.</p>
    <p>Ap­pear­ing on CNN’s Larry King Live, he said the only prob­lem with the Taj Ma­hal’s open­ing day was too much suc­cess. Gam­blers were play­ing the slots with such fe­roc­ity that the ma­chines al­most burst into flames.</p>
    <p>The Taj Ma­hal filed for bank­ruptcy the fol­low­ing year.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump ex­pounded on his world­view in a 2014 in­ter­view with au­thor Michael D’An­to­nio.</p>
    <p>“You can be tough and ruth­less and all that stuff, and if you lose a lot, no­body’s go­ing to fol­low you, be­cause you’re looked at as a loser,” he said. “Win­ning is a very im­por­tant thing. The most im­por­tant as­pect of leadership is win­ning. If you have a record of win­ning, peo­ple are go­ing to fol­low you.”</p>
    <p>Of course, Mr Trump’s need to be seen as a win­ner has in­formed his pres­i­dency. The self-de­clared su­perla­tives cover all bases, from be­ing the “best thing that ever hap­pened to Puerto Rico” to doing the most for black Amer­i­cans (with the “pos­si­ble ex­cep­tion” of Abra­ham Lin­coln). In an­tic­i­pa­tion of his even­tual im­peach­ment this year, Mr Trump re­ferred to him­self as “our great­est of all pres­i­dents”.</p>
    <p>Af­ter he was sworn in as the 45th pres­i­dent of the United States in Jan­uary 2017, his ad­min­is­tra­tion as­serted that the inau­gu­ra­tion’s au­di­ence was the largest ever, de­spite all ev­i­dence to the con­trary. But any sug­ges­tion other­wise would have ren­dered Mr Trump a loser in some imag­ined con­test about inau­gu­ra­tion crowd sizes.</p>
    <p>Now, nearly four years later, the cit­i­zens have cast their bal­lots, base­less law­suits al­leg­ing elec­toral fraud have been dis­missed and states have cer­ti­fied the vote.</p>
    <p>Still, the loser of the 2020 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion con­tin­ues to see crowds that the rest of the coun­try does not.</p>
    <p>It ends as it be­gan.</p>
