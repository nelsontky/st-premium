    <p>At­ten­dees at One Cham­pi­onship’s In­side The Ma­trix event last night were greeted by stan­chions with red belts and a mul­ti­tude of ush­ers wear­ing face shields out­side the Sin­ga­pore In­door Sta­dium. The lucky 250 fans were the first to get the op­por­tu­nity to watch a live sport event in the Repub­lic since the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In­stead of blar­ing loud mu­sic and a red car­pet, at­ten­dees at One Cham­pi­onship’s In­side The Ma­trix event last night were greeted by stan­chions with red belts and a mul­ti­tude of ush­ers wear­ing face shields out­side the Sin­ga­pore In­door Sta­dium.</p>
    <p>Not that the un­char­ac­ter­is­ti­cally muted at­mos­phere out­side the arena mat­tered to the 250 fans who were the first to get the op­por­tu­nity to watch a live sports event in the Repub­lic since the coro­n­avirus pan­demic be­gan.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial ad­viser Ian Leo Tay, 33, told The Straits Times: “Be­ing out here feels like we’re get­ting back a bit of our nor­mal life.</p>
    <p>“Even though it’s only 250 peo­ple, it’s a good start, and hope­fully this one turns out well so in the fu­ture we can have big­ger events with more peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>The In­side The Ma­trix event with its lim­ited crowd comes three weeks af­ter One’s pre­vi­ous closed­door show, Reign of Dy­nas­ties, which was held at the same venue.</p>
    <p>The events are part of a pi­lot project that the Govern­ment hopes will help iden­tify a model that can be widely im­ple­mented so that more large-scale events can re­sume safely in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Last night’s spec­ta­tors were re­quired to un­dergo an anti­gen rapid test at one of 10 des­ig­nated clin­ics on the same day, and pro­duce a valid neg­a­tive test cer­tifi­cate be­fore they were al­lowed into the venue.</p>
    <p>The test re­turns re­sults in un­der half an hour, com­pared with the gold-stan­dard poly­merase chain re­ac­tion test that takes a few hours to process. Both pro­ce­dures are sim­i­lar.</p>
    <p>It was the first swab test Mr Tay had un­der­gone, and while he ad­mit­ted with a wry smile that it was “a bit un­com­fort­able”, he added that he did not feel in­con­ve­nienced by all the ex­tra mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“The only thing ex­tra was the test, re­ally,” said the mixed mar­tial arts (MMA) fan, who tries to at­tend all of One’s shows in Sin­ga­pore. “The process, as a whole, was quite smooth sail­ing. The in­struc­tions were very clear so we knew what we had to do.”</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to the test­ing pro­to­cols, at­ten­dees ac­cessed the In­door Sta­dium through five sep­a­rate en­trances, with ush­ers and mar­shals en­sur­ing safe dis­tanc­ing was ad­hered to through­out.</p>
    <p>In­side, spec­ta­tors were seated apart, with only about 10 per cent of the 10,000-ca­pac­ity arena’s seats al­lo­cated for them.</p>
    <p>An­other spec­ta­tor, 36-year-old en­gi­neer Nay Zar, also gave the thumbs up for the or­gan­i­sa­tion of the event.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­thing was very fast,” said the Myan­mar na­tional, who was at the event to sup­port coun­try­man Aung La N Sang, One’s mid­dleweight and light heavy­weight cham­pion. “I have been to other events where there were prob­lems, but not here. One Cham­pi­onship’s ar­range­ment is very nice.”</p>
    <p>Based in Sin­ga­pore for the past 12 years, Mr Nay Zar works in the con­struc­tion line and has been tested reg­u­larly – yes­ter­day’s anti­gen rapid test was his 13th swab test – so he ex­plained he had no is­sues be­ing tested again.</p>
    <p>“It’s ex­pected for an event like this,” he added. “I think Sin­ga­pore is ready for more op­por­tu­ni­ties of live events like this and I hope more come back soon.”</p>
    <p>It was clear from the at­mos­phere in­side the arena once the event started that the fans were hun­gry for live sports en­ter­tain­ment.</p>
    <p>En­thu­si­as­tic ap­plause and whoops of de­light met the ring of the first bell for the open­ing bout be­tween In­dia’s Ritu Phogat and Cam­bo­dia’s Nou Srey Pov, and fans lapped up all the ac­tion through­out the three-hour card.</p>
    <p>For Sin­ga­pore’s Tif­fany Teo, who lost her fight with China’s Xiong Jing­nan for the women’s strawweigh­t ti­tle, the fans at the venue were a wel­come sight. She had fought in­side an al­most-empty arena at One’s closed-door event in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>She said: “The en­ergy was re­ally dif­fer­ent. It was not a full sta­dium but I could hear ev­ery­one loud and clear. In a usual event with a big crowd, the sound is muf­fled... It was a dif­fer­ent ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>In­side The Ma­trix is One’s big­gest event of the year and fea­tured six fights, four of which were world ti­tle bouts.</p>
