    <p>Ja­pan hit a new daily high i n Covid-19 cases yes­ter­day, with at least 1,651 cases na­tion­wide, ac­cord­ing to a tally by broad­caster NHK.</p>
    <p>Econ­omy Min­is­ter Ya­su­toshi Nishimura, who is in charge of the coro­n­avirus re­sponse, warned of more strin­gent mea­sures if the in­fec­tions con­tin­ued to spike, lead­ing to an over­bur­den­ing of med­i­cal in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>“We are not at a point where a state of emer­gency must be de­clared, but we need to have the strong­est sense of cau­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts say the cur­rent surge is par­tic­u­larly wor­ry­ing, given that so­cio-eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties have, for the most part, re­turned to pre-Covid-19 days.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials have i n re­cent days stressed the in­fec­tion risks posed by nomikais – af­ter-work drink­ing par­ties – that are com­mon at work­places or among friends.</p>
    <p>Adding to these fears is the on­set of win­ter, when peo­ple tend to spend more time i ndoors i n heated, poorly ven­ti­lated rooms.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to the surge, Mr Nishimura said ca­pac­ity lim­its for large events will be kept in place for an­other three months un­til the end of next Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan has capped at­ten­dance of events at 10,000 peo­ple or 50 per cent of a venue’s ca­pac­ity, which­ever is lower, though in a trial last month, 32,000 base­ball fans were packed into a Yoko­hama sta­dium over three match days.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has also said the Go To Travel do­mes­tic tourism cam­paign should not be made a scapegoat for the rise in in­fec­tions, de­spite a surge in asymp­to­matic cases in pop­u­lar tourist des­ti­na­tions with large ur­ban pop­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s worst day in its bat­tle against the coro­n­avirus comes de­spite the na­tion hav­ing en­tered into agree­ments to re­lax travel re­stric­tions with coun­tries that have largely man­aged to put a lid on in­fec­tions, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, China and South Korea.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese main­land reg­is­tered 15 new cases on Wed­nes­day, the na­tional health au­thor­ity said yes­ter­day. This brings China’s tally to 86,299. South Korea added 143 cases yes­ter­day, rais­ing its caseload to 27,942. Ja­pan’s to­tal is 113,816 cases.</p>
    <p>Tokyo recorded 393 cases yes­ter­day, its high­est since Aug 8. In­fec­tious dis­ease ex­pert No­rio Oh­ma­gari, who is ad­vis­ing Tokyo au­thor­i­ties, warned that this por­tends the start of a sharp rise in in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Osaka logged 231 in­fec­tions on the third straight day it has had more than 200 cases.</p>
    <p>Aichi, where the city of Nagoya is sit­u­ated, had 143 cases, the high­est fig­ure since Aug 8.</p>
    <p>New daily peaks were logged in ar­eas like Hokkaido, with the bulk of the 236 cases in Sap­poro.</p>
    <p>Kana­gawa, which is part of the Greater Tokyo re­gion, had 147 cases. And Hyogo, where the city of Kobe is sit­u­ated, had 81 cases.</p>
    <p>These spikes come even as Tokyo pre­pares to wel­come two high-level vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee chief Thomas Bach will make a four-day visit from Sun­day, and Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son will make a two-day trip from next Tues­day. Mr Mor­ri­son will be the first head of state in Tokyo since the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>Mr Bach, who will be on his first visit to Tokyo since the de­ci­sion was made in March to post­pone the Olympic Games by a year, said dis­cus­sions over the pos­si­bil­ity of an out­right can­cel­la­tion of the Games will not be on the ta­ble.</p>
    <p>A Ja­panese panel, tasked to look into virus pre­ven­tion mea­sures, said yes­ter­day that it will de­cide by spring whether to set au­di­ence caps at sport­ing venues, and whether to even al­low for­eign spec­ta­tors into the coun­try. In the event they are al­lowed, how­ever, they will most likely be ex­empted from serv­ing a 14-day quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga has asked his Cabi­net to com­pile a third sup­ple­men­tary bud­get for the cur­rent fis­cal year to fi­nance a new eco­nomic stim­u­lus pack­age that is likely to in­clude more sup­port for busi­nesses, as well as fund­ing for an ex­ten­sion of the Go To Travel cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Even with­out the lat­est spike, the Covid-19 cri­sis has driven up bank­rupt­cies and sui­cides across Ja­pan, while also push­ing unem­ploy­ment to a three-year high.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment must work at full force to al­low so­cial and eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties as well as mea­sures to slow the spread of the virus to keep go­ing as we pre­pare for win­ter,” Mr Suga said.</p>
