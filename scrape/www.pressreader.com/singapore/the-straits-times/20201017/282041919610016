    <p>Just two days af­ter a mas­sive break­down crip­pled the North-South, East-West and Cir­cle MRT lines, a fire broke out in a train tun­nel between Or­chard and Som­er­set sta­tions early yes­ter­day soon af­ter op­er­at­ing hours ended.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent took place when an en­gi­neer­ing lo­co­mo­tive – used for haul­ing heavy equip­ment for af­ter­hours main­te­nance – caught fire. Soon, thick smoke en­gulfed the tun­nel, ac­cord­ing to a source. “Work­ers were run­ning for their lives,” he said.</p>
    <p>Two work­ers at the site were taken to hospital for smoke in­hala­tion. SMRT said at around 10.30pm yes­ter­day that they have been dis­charged and are rest­ing at home.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force (SCDF) said it re­ceived a call at 12.45am yes­ter­day about a fire at Som­er­set MRT sta­tion.</p>
    <p>“The fire in­volved the en­gine com­part­ment of a lo­co­mo­tive train,” said an SCDF spokesman. “SMRT staff ex­tin­guished the fire us­ing four ex­tin­guish­ers prior to SCDF’s ar­rival.</p>
    <p>“SCDF con­veyed two per­sons to Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hospital for smoke in­hala­tion. The cause of fire is un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion.”</p>
    <p>SMRT said the fire broke out around 12.35am. “There were nine staff on board who helped to ex­tin­guish the fire,” said an SMRT spokesman. She said the two work­ers taken to hospital “were checked for smoke in­hala­tion”, but there were “no in­juries”.</p>
    <p>“Train ser­vice was not af­fected,” she added. “In­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing.”</p>
    <p>This was not the first time tun­nel fires have bro­ken out in MRT sta­tions. In Oc­to­ber 2017, a fire was spot­ted in a tun­nel between Ma­rina Bay and Raf­fles Place sta­tions, on the same day the Bis­han tun­nels were flooded.</p>
    <p>In Novem­ber 2015, an elec­tri­cal fire hap­pened just be­fore 6am on the North-South line.</p>
    <p>In that same year, a cir­cuit­breaker fire shut down the Bukit Pan­jang LRT sys­tem for a day.</p>
    <p>In 2013, a short-cir­cuit fire broke out near New­ton, en­gulf­ing the sta­tion in smoke and dis­rupt­ing ser­vice for two hours in the morn­ing peak.</p>
    <p>Also in 2004, a fire broke out in the tun­nel near New­ton, ap­par­ently caused by a short cir­cuit.</p>
    <p>Most such fires were sparked by elec­tri­cal faults, such as failed cir­cuit break­ers.</p>
    <p>Fires in­volv­ing en­gi­neer­ing lo­co­mo­tives are how­ever rarer, ac­cord­ing to in­dus­try play­ers.</p>
    <p>Most of th­ese lo­co­mo­tives are diesel-pow­ered. While diesel is less com­bustible than petrol, it can ig­nite when over­heat­ing and fuel leaks oc­cur. On the roads, diesel taxis burst into flames oc­ca­sion­ally.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary 2008, a main­te­nance train slammed into its lo­co­mo­tive be­cause work­ers failed to en­gage the park­ing brake. The in­ci­dent dis­rupted ser­vice on the East-West line for seven hours.</p>
