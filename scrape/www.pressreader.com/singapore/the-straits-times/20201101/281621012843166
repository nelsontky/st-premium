    <p>Talks on a bi­par­ti­san con­fi­dence and sup­ply agree­ment (CSA) have be­gun ahead of Malaysia’s cru­cial bud­get vote in a pos­si­ble boost for Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin and the longevity of his shaky gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The Sun­day Times has learnt that in­for­mal dis­cus­sions have been on­go­ing last week be­tween the Perikatan Na­sional (PN) gov­ern­ment and the Pakatan Hara­pan-led (PH) op­po­si­tion, be­fore an ex­ploratory meet­ing was held in Par­lia­ment on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Fi­nance Min­is­ter Tengku Zafrul Aziz has also held con­sul­ta­tions with for­mer min­is­ters from the op­po­si­tion last week, and will meet PH rep­re­sen­ta­tives to­day. PH chief sec­re­tary Sai­fud­din Na­su­tion con­firmed the meet­ing and told The Sun­day Times it was a sep­a­rate mat­ter from the CSA talks.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Muhyid­din called on law­mak­ers in a tele­vised ad­dress yes­ter­day to “put the pub­lic in­ter­est above all other in­ter­ests”. “An un­der­stand­ing can be framed to en­sure Bud­get 2021 is ap­proved with the sup­port of gov­ern­ment and op­po­si­tion MPs,” the premier said.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cial sources said that ne­go­ti­a­tions will be­gin in earnest when MPs re­con­vene be­gin­ning to­mor­row, be­fore the Nov 6 tabling of Bud­get 2021. “Law Min­is­ter Takiyud­din Has­san is to chair ne­go­ti­a­tions to be­gin on Mon­day or Tues­day,” one op­po­si­tion MP said.</p>
    <p>Datuk Takiyud­din, the Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia sec­re­tary-gen­eral, could not be reached for im­me­di­ate com­ment, while an­other Sabah-based MP said he was aware of on­go­ing talks. “There have been for­mal and in­for­mal meet­ings. We hope it will re­sult in a bud­get and re­forms that are in the best in­ter­est of the pub­lic,” he said.</p>
    <p>Pro­pos­als for a CSA sur­faced af­ter King Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah re­jected last Sun­day the gov­ern­ment’s sud­den re­quest for emer­gency pow­ers. He called on politi­cians not to threaten the sta­bil­ity of the Muhyid­din ad­min­is­tra­tion which has only 113 MPs in the 222-strong Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Po­ten­tial elec­tions, should the gov­ern­ment’s bud­get be de­feated, would ex­ac­er­bate an on­go­ing wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions which has al­ready seen Oc­to­ber record more cases than the rest of the year com­bined.</p>
    <p>The royal re­buff was an em­bar­rass­ing set­back for the premier that came af­ter a month-long po­lit­i­cal im­broglio which was trig­gered when Datuk Seri An­war claimed to have a “for­mi­da­ble ma­jor­ity” in late Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Umno, the gov­ern­ment’s largest com­po­nent party, has since backed away from threats to leave the PN gov­ern­ment, es­pe­cially af­ter Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah re­peated on Wed­nes­day his call to en­sure that Bud­get 2021 is ap­proved.</p>
    <p>The Sun­day Times un­der­stands that in ex­change for sup­port­ing the gov­ern­ment in votes con­cern­ing spend­ing or con­fi­dence, op­po­si­tion rep­re­sen­ta­tives are ask­ing for equal al­lo­ca­tion for their con­stituen­cies and the set­ting up of bi­par­ti­san par­lia­men­tary com­mit­tees to con­sult on leg­is­la­tion. Malaysia’s rul­ing par­ties have typ­i­cally al­lo­cated RM1.5 mil­lion (S$492,000) to RM6 mil­lion an­nu­ally to their own MPs while hand­ing op­po­si­tion coun­ter­parts RM100,000 or less.</p>
    <p>Sources said the time frame for the CSA could last un­til the bud­get for 2023, just be­fore Par­lia­ment’s term ends that year. How­ever, Umno’s in­sis­tence that snap polls be held as soon as coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions are un­der con­trol could dras­ti­cally shorten the length, or even scup­per the deal.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Muhyid­din (be­low) called on law­mak­ers in a tele­vised ad­dress yes­ter­day to “put the pub­lic in­ter­est above all other in­ter­ests”. “An un­der­stand­ing can be framed to en­sure Bud­get 2021 is ap­proved with the sup­port of gov­ern­ment and op­po­si­tion MPs,” the premier said.</p>
