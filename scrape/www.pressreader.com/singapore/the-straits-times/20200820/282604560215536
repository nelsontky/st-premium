    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Bri­tish ac­tor Ben Cross, who is best known to one gen­er­a­tion for play­ing a de­ter­mined run­ner i n the Acad­emy Award-win­ning film Char­i­ots Of Fire (1981) and to an­other au­di­ence decades later for his role in a re­boot of Star Trek (2009), died on Tues­day after a short ill­ness. He was 72.</p>
    <p>His daugh­ter Lauren an­nounced his death, after an un­spec­i­fied ill­ness, on Cross’ Face­book page. She said he had died in Vi­enna, The As­so­ci­ated Press re­ported.</p>
    <p>The film Char­i­ots Of Fire tells the story of two Bri­tish track stars in the 1924 Olympics who are com­pet­ing for some­thing greater than medals and world records.</p>
    <p>Cross trained daily for 21 /</p>
    <p>2 months to play the role of Harold Abra­hams, a fu­ri­ously com­pet­i­tive ath­lete and son of Jewish im­mi­grants look­ing to be­come vis­i­ble in an An­glo-Saxon so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>In 2009, Cross ap­peared in a re­boot of t he Star Trek film fran­chise, play­ing Spock’s fa­ther Sarek, who i mparts this bit of ad­vice to this son: “What is nec­es­sary is never un­wise.”</p>
    <p>Harry Bernard Cross was born on Dec 16, 1947, in Lon­don, ac­cord­ing to his pro­file on IMDB.</p>
    <p>After roles in re­gional theatre and a brief part in the war epic A Bridge Too Far (1977), Cross had his break in a Broad­way mu­si­cal trans­ported to Lon­don’s West End, I Love My Wife.</p>
    <p>Then came an­other mu­si­cal, Chicago, in which he was work­ing when he read for a role in Char­i­ots Of Fire.</p>
    <p>The f i l m, co-star­ring Ian Charleson, who died in 1990, would go on to win four Os­cars, in­clud­ing Best Pic­ture and Best Orig­i­nal Score for its mem­o­rable theme.</p>
    <p>For decades, Cross worked steadily in tele­vi­sion and film.</p>
    <p>He had just com­pleted shoot­ing for the com­ing film The Devil’s</p>
    <p>Light, about an ex­or­cism, ac­cord­ing to a state­ment from his rep­re­sen­ta­tive Tracy Mapes.</p>
    <p>She said he would also be seen in</p>
    <p>Last Let­ter From Your Lover, about a jour­nal­ist who dis­cov­ers a se­ries of let­ters de­pict­ing a star-crossed love af­fair from the 1960s.</p>
