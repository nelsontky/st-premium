    <p>Fi­nan­cial ser­vices firm GoBear on Tues­day an­nounced that it will close the busi­ness due to its in­abil­ity to “raise more funds to con­tinue op­er­a­tions” amid the global pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, the fin­tech firm said Covid-19 has made the op­er­at­ing and fund-rais­ing en­vi­ron­ment “very chal­leng­ing”, de­spite the firm hav­ing made progress in its growth and trans­for­ma­tion plans last year.</p>
    <p>The fac­tors in­cluded a pro­longed pe­riod of weak­ened de­mand for some fi­nan­cial prod­ucts and ser­vices, in par­tic­u­lar travel in­sur­ance.</p>
    <p>Go Bear said the busi­ness clo­sure will be con­ducted in a “phased and con­trolled” man­ner over a “short time frame” and in ad­her­ence with lo­cal laws and reg­u­la­tions across the mar­kets in which it op­er­ates.</p>
    <p>Head­quar­tered in Sin­ga­pore, GoBear em­ploys 165 staff in six of­fices across Asia. Em­ploy­ees will be pro­vided their re­quired no­tice pe­ri­ods and salaries. The firm said it in­tends to ful­fil ex­ist­ing com­mit­ments to em­ploy­ees, part­ners and ven­dors, and work with the rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties to en­sure ad­her­ence to lo­cal laws and reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Its chief ex­ec­u­tive Adrian Chng said: “GoBear has made the dif­fi­cult de­ci­sion to close the busi­ness. Our pur­pose has been to im­prove the fi­nan­cial health of peo­ple across Asia, and I’m proud and grate­ful for the con­tri­bu­tions that all our em­ploy­ees and part­ners have made to­wards that mis­sion.</p>
    <p>“This is a dif­fi­cult time for our em­ploy­ees, and our pri­or­ity is to con­duct the process with the ut­most care and guid­ance to our staff. We take our re­spon­si­bil­ity to our cus­tomers, em­ploy­ees, part­ners and ven­dors very se­ri­ously and we in­tend to ful­fil our ex­ist­ing com­mit­ments to them as part of an or­derly busi­ness clo­sure process.”</p>
    <p>Last Septem­ber, the firm laid off 22 em­ploy­ees, or about 11 per cent of its to­tal work­force, on the back of the grim busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>GoBear was founded in 2015 and has served over 55 mil­lion users search­ing for more than 2,000 per­sonal fi­nance prod­ucts.</p>
