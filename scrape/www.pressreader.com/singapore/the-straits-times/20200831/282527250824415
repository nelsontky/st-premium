    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • TikTok stars Bryce Hall, 21, and Blake Gray, 19, are fac­ing crim­i­nal charges for throw­ing mega-par­ties at their Hol­ly­wood Hills man­sion in de­fi­ance of a ban against large gath­er­ings in Los An­ge­les, pros­e­cu­tors an­nounced last Friday.</p>
    <p>The two were each charged with a mis­de­meanour for vi­o­lat­ing the Safer L.A. health or­der and the city’s Party House Or­di­nance, said Mr Mike Feuer, the Los An­ge­les city at­tor­ney.</p>
    <p>The charges are among the first filed amid the city’s crack­down on so­cial gath­er­ings dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic. The two could face up to a year in jail and a fine of US$2,000 (S$2,717) if con­victed.</p>
    <p>“With hun­dreds of peo­ple at­tend­ing, loud mu­sic all night long and cars block­ing ac­cess for emer­gency ve­hi­cles, party houses are re­ally out-of-con­trol night­clubs, and they’ve hi­jacked the qual­ity of life of neigh­bours nearby,” Mr Feuer said in a statement last Friday. “As if that weren’t enough, the hosts are in­cred­i­bly ir­re­spon­si­ble, with Covid-19 spread­ing and par­ties banned be­cause of it. We’ve got to put a stop to it.”</p>
    <p>A rep­re­sen­ta­tive for Hall and Gray de­clined to comment on the charges. Hall and Gray are prom­i­nent Gen-Z so­cial me­dia in­flu­encers with a com­bined 19 mil­lion fol­low­ers on TikTok.</p>
    <p>Mr Feuer said he hoped those with such a pow­er­ful plat­form would use it more re­spon­si­bly. “You should be mod­el­ling good be­hav­iour – not brazenly vi­o­lat­ing the law and post­ing videos about it, as we al­lege,” he said.</p>
    <p>On Aug 19, Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los An­ge­les or­dered the wa­ter shut off at Hall and Gray’s home, also in re­sponse to their con­tin­ued par­ty­ing.</p>
    <p>Hall threw at least three large par­ties this month, in­clud­ing one for his 21st birth­day at a house in En­cino with hun­dreds of guests. At least two of Hall’s par­ties re­sulted in ci­ta­tions af­ter neigh­bours called in noise complaints.</p>
    <p>Mr Feuer said he was not aware of any coro­n­avirus cases re­sult­ing di­rectly from Hall and Gray’s par­ties, but that the virus could still be in an in­cu­ba­tion phase. Hall’s most re­cent party was held on Aug 14.</p>
    <p>High-pro­file in­flu­encers con­tinue to face back­lash for so­cial­is­ing and ig­nor­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing rec­om­men­da­tions. The county has recorded nearly 237,000 cases of Covid-19 and more than 5,700 deaths.</p>
    <p>“It isn’t just the party house it­self that’s af­fected,” Mr Feuer said. “These in­di­vid­u­als who at­tend your par­ties could leave and spread it to sib­lings, to par­ents, to grand­par­ents, to co-work­ers, to oth­ers in the pub­lic.”</p>
    <p>He also warned those who at­tend these par­ties. “In­di­vid­u­als who at­tend par­ties could also face con­se­quences.”</p>
