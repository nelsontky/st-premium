    <p>From Oct 3, all re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions will be al­lowed to con­duct con­gre­ga­tional and other wor­ship ser­vices for up to 100 peo­ple, Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This is dou­ble the limit for ser­vices held by most re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions cur­rently.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­i­sa­tions will still have to en­sure that safe dis­tanc­ing and safe man­age­ment mea­sures are in place when such ser­vices re­sume.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, only some re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions – which in­clude some mosques, churches and Hindu and Bud­dhist tem­ples – are al­lowed to hold gath­er­ings of up to 100 peo­ple, un­der a pi­lot scheme started by the Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth (MCCY) on Aug 7.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­i­sa­tions cho­sen were found to have proven they could con­duct ser­vices for up to 50 peo­ple, with safe man­age­ment prac­tices in place.</p>
    <p>These in­clude re­quir­ing con­gre­gants to wear a face mask at all times, and not al­low­ing singing and live per­for­mances.</p>
    <p>MCCY is also con­sid­er­ing a pi­lot to in­crease wor­ship lim­its for up to 250 peo­ple – split into five zones of 50 peo­ple for con­gre­ga­tional ser­vices – and will re­lease fur­ther de­tails in due course, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence, Mr Gan said the re­stric­tions were lifted as the pi­lot scheme car­ried out by MCCY had shown that safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures can be ef­fec­tively im­ple­mented.</p>
    <p>“Glob­ally and in Sin­ga­pore, we have seen large clus­ters seeded at re­li­gious gath­er­ings, and we have there­fore been very cau­tious in mit­i­gat­ing trans­mis­sions at these events.</p>
    <p>“At the same time, we recog­nise that re­li­gious ac­tiv­i­ties and wor­ship are im­por­tant facets of many Singa</p>
    <p>pore­ans’ daily lives... We hope these mea­sures will go some way to help sup­port Sin­ga­pore­ans’ spir­i­tual needs, es­pe­cially dur­ing these dif­fi­cult times,” said Mr Gan.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan Thiam Lye, chair­man of the Taoist Fed­er­a­tion, cheered the move to al­low more peo­ple to at­tend re­li­gious ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The re­lax­ation of rules from Oct 3 will mean that more devo­tees will be able to mark the an­nual Fes­ti­val of the Nine Em­peror Gods, also known as Kew Ong Yah in Hokkien, he said. The key Taoist fes­ti­val is due to kick off in the mid­dle of next month.</p>
    <p>But Mr Tan added that it is im­por­tant to en­sure that safe man­age­ment mea­sures are in place.</p>
    <p>Rev­erend Mal­colm Tan from Covenant Com­mu­nity Methodist Church in Bukit Timah said it wel­comes the an­nounce­ment.</p>
    <p>“It sits with our plans to come back to church by Christ­mas and to have some kind of on-site ser­vice then,” he said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, phys­i­cal ser­vices may not re­sume next month as de­tails will first have to be worked out, he added. The church, which has about 900 mem­bers, is cur­rently hold­ing ser­vices on­line.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally and in Sin­ga­pore, we have seen large clus­ters seeded at re­li­gious gath­er­ings, and we have there­fore been very cau­tious in mit­i­gat­ing trans­mis­sions at these events. At the same time, we recog­nise that re­li­gious ac­tiv­i­ties and wor­ship are im­por­tant facets of many Sin­ga­pore­ans’ daily lives... We hope these mea­sures will go some way to help sup­port Sin­ga­pore­ans’ spir­i­tual needs.</p>
