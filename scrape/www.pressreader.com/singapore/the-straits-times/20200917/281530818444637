    <p>Two con­struc­tion sites have re­ceived two stop-work or­ders each for fail­ing to pre­vent mosquito breed­ing this year. The Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency said en­force­ment ac­tion will be taken against the com­pa­nies man­ag­ing the two con­struc­tion sites.</p>
    <p>Two con­struc­tion sites have re­ceived two stop-work or­ders each for fail­ing to pre­vent mosquito breed­ing this year.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on the lo­cal dengue sit­u­a­tion is­sued yes­ter­day, the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) said en­force­ment ac­tion will be taken against the com­pa­nies man­ag­ing the two con­struc­tion sites.</p>
    <p>One of the sites, near Ar­nasalam Chetty Road and Kim Yam Road, in River Val­ley, was is­sued stop-work or­ders on July 20 and Sept 9.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond stop-work order is still in ef­fect, and will be lifted only when nec­es­sary pre­ven­tive mea­sures have been car­ried out, said NEA. The work site is lo­cated within a dengue clus­ter that cur­rently has 364 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Mul­ti­ple mosquito breed­ing habi­tats found at the work site in­cluded an air-con­di­tioner com­pres­sor, a can­vas sheet, a planter box and a wooden frame. Fifty or more mosquito lar­vae were found in each habi­tat.</p>
    <p>The other con­struc­tion site to re­ceive two stop-work or­ders is in Seran­goon North Av­enue 1. It re</p>
    <p>ceived the or­ders on July 15 and yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The mosquito breed­ing habi­tats de­tected at the site in­cluded water pond­ing in units of higher floors, with 50 or more lar­vae in each habi­tat.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, around 250 sum­monses were is­sued to con­struc­tion sites from Jan­uary to last month, while 10 con­trac­tors will be charged in court for re­peat of­fences.</p>
    <p>Apart from the four stop-work or­ders is­sued to the two work sites, an­other 17 such or­ders were is­sued this year.</p>
    <p>NEA said that it has worked with the Sin­ga­pore Con­trac­tors As­so­ci­a­tion, com­pa­nies man­ag­ing con­struc­tion sites, com­mu­nity part­ners and res­i­dents to step up dengue pre­ven­tion and con­trol ef­forts in con­struc­tion sites.</p>
    <p>To man­age mosquito breed­ing at work sites, con­struc­tion site op­er­a­tors were in­structed to main­tain a min­i­mum work­force to per­form house­keep­ing and fa­cil­i­tate pest con­trol ser­vices within the sites dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Since the cir­cuit breaker started on April 7, all 1,213 con­struc­tion sites across the is­land have also</p>
    <p>been in­spected at least once.</p>
    <p>Al­though last week was the fifth con­sec­u­tive week of de­cline in the weekly num­ber of dengue cases, with 726 cases re­ported, Sin­ga­pore is still in the midst of its largest dengue out­break.</p>
    <p>Some 28,944 cases were re­ported in the first 37 weeks of this year, sur­pass­ing the pre­vi­ous high of 22,170 re­ported in the whole of 2013.</p>
    <p>As at Sept 5, 21 peo­ple aged be­tween 25 and 92 have died of dengue this year. Of these, 18 worked or lived in ac­tive dengue clusters.</p>
