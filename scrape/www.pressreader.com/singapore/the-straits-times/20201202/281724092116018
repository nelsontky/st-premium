    <p>SEOUL • China’s ef­forts to win an in­ter­na­tional cer­ti­fi­ca­tion for “pao cai”, a pick­led veg­etable dish from Sichuan, is turn­ing into a so­cial me­dia show­down be­tween Chi­nese and South Korean ne­ti­zens over the ori­gin of kim­chi, a sta­ple Korean dish made of cab­bage.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing re­cently won a cer­ti­fi­ca­tion from the In­ter­na­tional Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Stan­dard­i­s­a­tion (ISO) for pao cai, an achieve­ment the state-run Global Times re­ported as “an in­ter­na­tional stan­dard for the kim­chi in­dus­try led by China”.</p>
    <p>South Korean me­dia was fast to dis­pute such a claim and ac­cuse the big­ger neigh­bour of try­ing to make kim­chi a type of China-made pao cai.</p>
    <p>The episode trig­gered anger on South Korean so­cial me­dia. “Its to­tal non­sense, what a thief steal­ing our cul­ture!” a South Korean ne­ti­zen wrote on Naver.com, a widely pop­u­lar web por­tal.</p>
    <p>“I read a me­dia story that China now says kim­chi is theirs, and that they are mak­ing in­ter­na­tional stan­dard for it. It’s ab­surd. I’m wor­ried that they might steal the han­bok and other cul­tural con­tents, not just kim­chi,” said Ms Kim Seol-ha, 28, in Seoul, re­fer­ring to the tra­di­tional Korean cloth­ing.</p>
    <p>Some South Korean me­dia even de­scribed the episode as China’s “bid for world dom­i­na­tion”, while some so­cial me­dia com­ments flagged con­cerns that Bei­jing was ex­er­cis­ing “eco­nomic co­er­cion”.</p>
    <p>On China’s Twit­ter-like Weibo, Chi­nese ne­ti­zens were claim­ing kim­chi as their coun­try’s tra­di­tional dish, as most of the kim­chi con­sumed in South Korea is made in China. “Well, if you don’t meet the stan­dard, then you’re not kim­chi,” one wrote on Weibo.</p>
    <p>“Even the pro­nun­ci­a­tion of kim­chi orig­i­nated from Chi­nese, what else is there to say,” wrote an­other.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s Agri­cul­ture Min­istry on Sun­day re­leased a state­ment say­ing mainly that the ISO-ap­proved stan­dard does not ap­ply to kim­chi.</p>
    <p>“It is in­ap­pro­pri­ate to re­port (about pao cai win­ning the ISO) with­out dif­fer­en­ti­at­ing kim­chi from pao cai of China’s Sichuan,” the state­ment said.</p>
