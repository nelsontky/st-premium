    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has hit many in­dus­tries hard, but it has also pro­vided op­por­tu­ni­ties for sec­tors such as pre­ci­sion engi­neer­ing to grow.</p>
    <p>Semi­con­duc­tor test and han­dling com­pany AEM has ad­justed its rev­enue ex­pec­ta­tions up­wards to be­tween $480 mil­lion and $500 mil­lion. It has also seen rev­enue growth of nearly 82 per cent in the first half of this year com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>The 30-year-old com­pany, which has around 350 staff here, is look­ing to ex­pand its head­count here by 10 per cent to 15 per cent to pre­pare for the next wave of growth.</p>
    <p>Its chief ex­ec­u­tive Chan­dran Nair said: “The de­mand for semi­con­duc­tors has risen tremen­dously this year be­cause of fac­tors such as work­ing from home, data cen­tre de­mand, and due to changes in tech­nol­ogy nodes.</p>
    <p>“As tech­nol­ogy changes, semi­con­duc­tor test be­comes more com­plex, and as a lead­ing com­pany in semi­con­duc­tor testing world­wide, our method of testing is be­com­ing in­creas­ingly used and the de­mand for our tools is grow­ing.”</p>
    <p>He added that the growth of a 5G-driven econ­omy also cre­ates the need for high con­nec­tiv­ity and drives de­mand for the kind of tools that the com­pany makes.</p>
    <p>AEM’s prod­ucts are sold world­wide and it has a di­rect pres­ence in seven mar­kets, in­clud­ing China, the United States and France.</p>
    <p>“In the long term, al­though there will be pe­ri­ods of un­cer­tainty along the way, we see our­selves poised for growth,” said Mr Nair.</p>
    <p>To sup­port this growth, the com­pany is look­ing to hire for roles such as elec­tri­cal and elec­tronic engi­neer­ing, and me­chan­i­cal de­sign en­gi­neers and soft­ware en­gi­neers.</p>
    <p>The firm has also worked with gov­ern­ment agen­cies to al­low for work­ers from sec­tors such as aero­space engi­neer­ing to be sec­onded to AEM.</p>
    <p>It is also of­fer­ing more than 20 places for fresh grad­u­ates un­der the SGUnited Trainee­ships Pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The next year or so is pre­dicted to be a growth pe­riod for the semi­con­duc­tor in­dus­try, Mr Nair said.</p>
    <p>“We will ex­pand with re­gard to con­tin­u­ing to im­prove our prod­uct lines through tech­nol­ogy. We will also con­tinue to man­u­fac­ture and ramp up pro­duc­tion. A ma­jor focus for the com­ing 12 to 18 months would be on de­vel­op­ing tech­nol­ogy to cre­ate highly dif­fer­en­ti­ated prod­ucts that would de­crease the costs of testing semi­con­duc­tors,” he said.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Chan Chun Sing, who vis­ited AEM in Seran­goon North yes­ter­day, said the firm is an ex­am­ple of a com­pany that is grow­ing de­spite the pan­demic be­cause it is able to in­no­vate and pen­e­trate the mar­ket, even cap­tur­ing a part of the global value chain.</p>
    <p>“Nowa­days, when we look at in­vest­ments into Sin­ga­pore, cre­at­ing good jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans, we can­not just look at how much money we are mak­ing, how many jobs we are cre­at­ing, but we also need to look at where we sit in the en­tire global value chain so that we can­not be eas­ily by­passed or re­placed by other peo­ple,” he added.</p>
    <p>AEM elec­tri­cal en­gi­neer Rabiah Rai­han, 27, said the in­dus­try has bright prospects for work­ers like her. “I’ve been here for only three years, but I have been given the chance to lead a project, for in­stance. I de­sign ma­chines but also per­form other roles like tech­ni­cal sup­port as­sis­tance and even pack­ing and ship­ment. The com­pany nur­tures me to not just be the typ­i­cal en­gi­neer but also do things that help me to be an all rounder,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan added in a Face­book post after the visit: “As a small coun­try, we might not be able to be at ev­ery part of the global value chain but we are de­ter­mined to main­tain our po­si­tion as a key node within crit­i­cal parts of the global sup­ply chain where we can value-add.”</p>
