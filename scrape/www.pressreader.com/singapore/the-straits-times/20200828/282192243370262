    <p>We need a sys­tem­atic ap­proach to en­sure Sin­ga­porean work­ers con­tin­u­ally re­ceive train­ing to up­grade and sharpen their skill sets – just like op­er­a­tionally ready na­tional ser­vice­men af­ter they have com­pleted their full-time na­tional ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Rather than de­pend­ing on in­di­vid­ual mo­ti­va­tion or em­ployer nom­i­na­tion, a sys­tem­atic ap­proach en­sures the whole work­force is al­ways learn­ing and in the best shape of com­pet­i­tive­ness for Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy.</p>
    <p>This life­long learn­ing could pos­si­bly be a way to make Sin­ga­pore’s work­force unique and proac­tively trans­form along with the changes and needs.</p>
    <p>While the cur­rent Skill­sFu­ture ap­proach is good, its reach is of­ten not wide enough or does not reach spe­cific tar­get groups in a timely fash­ion.</p>
    <p>It is of­ten pas­sive and re­ac­tive as it re­lies on in­di­vid­u­als and em­ploy­ers to take the ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>I pro­pose that all Sin­ga­porean grad­u­ates from lo­cal uni­ver­si­ties or poly­tech­nics be of­fered up­grad­ing cour­ses upon grad­u­a­tion just like what is done for op­er­a­tionally ready na­tional ser­vice­men.</p>
    <p>Those who at­tend the rec­om­mended rel­e­vant train­ing or cour­ses get cred­its and recog­ni­tion to help them in their ca­reer. This will en­sure they do not start look­ing for job con­ver­sion only when they are re­trenched or when a cri­sis hap­pens.</p>
    <p>If one has em­barked on a ca­reer that is dif­fer­ent from what he had stud­ied, he could be rec­om­mended the rel­e­vant course in the in­dus­try he has switched to.</p>
    <p>Just as doc­tors and lawyers have to chalk up con­tin­u­ing ed­u­ca­tion hours or cred­its in or­der to re­tain their prac­tis­ing li­cence, the same kind of sys­tem can be ex­tended to other jobs in var­i­ous in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>At the end of the day, hav­ing such a sys­tem is about proac­tively sus­tain­ing work­force ex­cel­lence.</p>
