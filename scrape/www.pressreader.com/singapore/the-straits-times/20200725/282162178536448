    <p>Dr Alexan­der Davis ad­mits that he can be a glut­ton for pun­ish­ment. He staked part of his PhD on find­ing some of the world’s best-cam­ou­flaged fish in the ocean’s deep­est depths. These an­i­mals are so keen on not be­ing found that they have evolved the abil­ity to ab­sorb more than 99.9 per cent of the light that hits their skin.</p>
    <p>To lo­cate and study these so­called ul­tra-black fish, the Duke Univer­sity bi­ol­o­gist said he re­lied largely on the luck of the draw. “We ba­si­cally just drop nets and see what we get,” he said. “You never know what you’re go­ing to pull up.”</p>
    <p>When he and his col­leagues did cash in, they cashed in big. In a pa­per pub­lished in Cur­rent Bi­ol­ogy, they re­port snar­ing the first doc­u­mented ul­tra-black an­i­mals in the ocean, and some of the dark­est creatures ever found: 16 types of deepsea fish that are so black, they man­i­fest as per­ma­nent sil­hou­ettes – light-de­vour­ing voids that seem to shred the fab­ric of space-time.</p>
    <p>“It’s like look­ing at a black hole,” Dr Davis said.</p>
    <p>To qual­ify as ul­tra-black, a sub­stance has to re­flect less than 0.5 per cent of the light that hits it. Some birds of par­adise man­age this, beam­ing back as lit­tle as 0.05 per cent, as do cer­tain types of but­ter­flies (0.06 per cent) and spi­ders (0.35 per cent).</p>
    <p>A feat of engi­neer­ing al­lowed hu­mans to best them all with syn­thetic ma­te­ri­als, some of which re­flect only 0.045 per cent of in­com­ing light. (“Black” pa­per, on the other hand, re­turns a whop­ping 10 per cent of the light it meets.) Now, it seems fish may come close to trounc­ing them all.</p>
    <p>One species pro­filed in the pa­per, a bi­o­lu­mi­nes­cent an­gler­fish in the genus Oneirodes, re­flects as lit­tle as 0.044 per cent to 0.051 per cent of the deep-sea light it en­coun­ters. The other 99.95 per cent, Dr Davis and his col­leagues found, gets lost in a labyrinth of light-swal­low­ing pig­ments un­til it ef­fec­tively dis­ap­pears.</p>
    <p>“I’m al­ways ar­gu­ing with bird peo­ple on the In­ter­net,” said Dr Kory Evans, a fish bi­ol­o­gist at Rice Univer­sity who was not in­volved in the study. “I say, ‘I bet these deep-sea fish are as dark as your birds of par­adise.’ And then boom, they checked, and that was ex­actly the case.”</p>
    <p>Su­per-dark skin might seem re­dun­dant hun­dreds or thou­sands of feet be­neath the sur­face of the sea, where the sun’s rays do not reach. But thanks to the DIY light cooked up by bi­o­lu­mi­nes­cent creatures, this part of the ocean can ac­tu­ally “sparkle like the sky”, said Dr Prosanta Chakrabart­y, a fish bi­ol­o­gist at Louisiana State Univer­sity who was not in­volved in the study.</p>
    <p>Birds, but­ter­flies and spi­ders tend to use ul­tra-black for con­trast, mak­ing vi­brant patches of colour pop against an ex­treme back­drop. Some fish may do this, too. But in a world where many deep-sea lurk­ers use their home­made glow to lure in prey, ul­tra-black may func­tion more as a dis­ap­pear­ing act for swim­mers that do not want to be spot­ted, Dr Evans said.</p>
    <p>To suss out how deep-sea fish con­jure their cloaks of in­vis­i­bil­ity, the re­searchers took skin sam­ples from</p>
    <p>To qual­ify as ul­tra-black, a sub­stance has to re­flect less than 0.5 per cent of the light that hits it. Some birds of par­adise man­age this, beam­ing back as lit­tle as 0.05 per cent, as do cer­tain types of but­ter­flies (0.06 per cent) and spi­ders (0.35 per cent). A feat of engi­neer­ing al­lowed hu­mans to best them all with syn­thetic ma­te­ri­als, some of which re­flect only 0.045 per cent of in­com­ing light... Now, it seems fish may come close to trounc­ing them all.</p>
    <p>nine species of ul­tra-black fish and an­a­lysed them un­der the mi­cro­scope.</p>
    <p>Like many other an­i­mals, in­clud­ing hu­mans, fish pig­ment their skin with me­lanin, a light-ab­sorb­ing com­pound stored in mi­cro­scopic com­part­ments called melanosome­s. Typ­i­cally coloured fish scat­ter these pock­ets of pig­ment into a sparse, even layer held up by a pro­tein called col­la­gen. Any light that hits the me­lanin head-on is gob­bled up, while light that misses the mark ric­o­chets back to­wards the viewer.</p>
    <p>To main­tain their stealth, the re­searchers found, ul­tra-black fish skimp on the col­la­gen. That al­lows them to pack their melanosome­s to­gether like piled grains of rice. When light con­tacts the clut­ter, what is not ab­sorbed is de­flected side­ways – straight into the path of an­other ravenous melanosome.</p>
    <p>Ul­tra-black birds, but­ter­flies and spi­ders do some­thing sim­i­lar, but per­haps in a less ef­fi­cient way, said Dr Karen Os­born, a zo­ol­o­gist at the Smith­so­nian Na­tional Mu­seum of Nat­u­ral His­tory and an au­thor on the study, which she be­gan in 2014.</p>
    <p>Rather than us­ing the same struc­ture – melanosome­s – to ab­sorb and de­flect light, as fish do, these land-liv­ing an­i­mals em­bed their me­lanin in mazes of bumps, boxes or spikes that bounce pho­tons back and forth. What deep-sea fish do “is a much sim­pler sys­tem”, ac­cord­ing to Dr Os­born.</p>
    <p>That could be a sav­ing grace for creatures that must eke out a liv­ing in an en­vi­ron­ment as harsh and un­for­giv­ing as the deep sea, said Dr Anela Choy, a deep-sea re­searcher at the Scripps In­sti­tu­tion of Oceanog­ra­phy in San Diego who was not in­volved in the study.</p>
    <p>Down there, Dr Choy said, ev­ery­thing “has to do with sur­vival: eat­ing, not be­ing eaten and re­pro­duc­ing your­self”.</p>
    <p>Some of the ocean’s deep­est dwellers might be even darker than what Dr Davis and his col­leagues have dredged up.</p>
    <p>“I would not be sur­prised if we have not yet found the black­est fish in the sea,” Dr Chakrabart­y said.</p>
