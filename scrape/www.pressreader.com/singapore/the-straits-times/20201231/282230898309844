    <p>A man fell into a pit about 1.5m deep out­side a cof­fee shop in Yishun on Sun­day, after step­ping on a metal lid that gave way.</p>
    <p>Mr Colin Pereira, 57, pulled a back mus­cle and suf­fered cuts on his right knee as a re­sult of the fall near Block 732 Yishun Av­enue 5, Chi­nese lan­guage news­pa­per Lianhe Zaobao re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The pit is a grease trap, which cap­tures oil from the cof­fee shop’s waste wa­ter.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times, Nee Soon Town Coun­cil spokesman Pauline Kwa said a team was dis­patched to cor­don off the area im­me­di­ately after it was alerted to the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>“(The grease trap) is un­der the cof­fee shop owner’s main­te­nance... The town coun­cil is in touch with the cof­fee shop to ex­pe­dite re­pair works and (has) alerted the Hous­ing and De­vel­op­ment Board,” Ms Kwa said.</p>
    <p>She added that the town coun­cil will be send­ing out a let­ter to all cof­fee shops in Nee Soon town to re­mind them to con­duct reg­u­lar checks and main­te­nance of their grease trap cov­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Pereira, a part-time de­liv­ery man, told Zaobao that two bird cages he had been car­ry­ing were dam­aged in the fall.</p>
    <p>Passers-by came to his aid, helped him out of the pit and called for an am­bu­lance.</p>
    <p>After paramedics came and ban­daged his knee, Mr Pereira said he did not want to be taken to hospi­tal. But the pain wors­ened and he went to hospi­tal later that day, he told Zaobao.</p>
    <p>Mr Pereira, who was given a week of med­i­cal leave, said he spent $600 on his med­i­cal treat­ment.</p>
