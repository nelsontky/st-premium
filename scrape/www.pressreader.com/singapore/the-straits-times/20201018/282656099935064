    <p>Pre­fer to do it your­self? Here are ex­pert tips for plan­ning a bud­get-friendly pic­nic with the wow fac­tor: 1</p>
    <p>PACK RIGHT, PACK LIGHT</p>
    <p>Ms Camie Chua, a se­nior man­ager in mar­ket­ing and busi­ness de­vel­op­ment at One Faber Group – which runs restau­rants such as Good Old Days in Sen­tosa and is cur­rently of­fer­ing pic­nic sets – says: “Make sure to pack right and light, es­pe­cially if you are look­ing to hike up a long dis­tance be­fore reach­ing your pic­nic spot.</p>
    <p>“While wicker bas­kets may be charm­ing, they may not al­ways be the most prac­ti­cal op­tion. If pos­si­ble, do use in­su­lated bags to keep your packed food and fruit at the right tem­per­a­ture.”</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>DON’T STRUG­GLE WITH THE MAT</p>
    <p>Save space for bums, not just food.</p>
    <p>Ms Chua says: “Be sure to take along a sturdy pic­nic mat that is large enough. Pic­nic­go­ers of­ten strug­gle with lim­ited mat space, es­pe­cially af­ter all the food is laid out on the mat.</p>
    <p>“To avoid deal­ing with a dirty and dam­aged mat, do not use a thin plas­tic sheet that tears eas­ily. Us­ing a thick mat also means you can sit com­fort­ably without be­ing trou­bled by the un­even ground.”</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>LO­CA­TION IS KEY</p>
    <p>Mr Khairul Amri Mohd Sidik, co-founder and direc­tor of Pic­needs, sug­gests venues such as</p>
    <p>Ma­rina Bar­rage and Bay East Gar­den for In­sta­grammable views of the Cen­tral Busi­ness District.</p>
    <p>Be­sides beaches like East Coast Park and Changi Beach, try more un­usual pic­nic spots like Kent Ridge Park or Labrador Na­ture Re­serve.</p>
    <p>He also rec­om­mends ap­ply­ing in­sect re­pel­lent as a de­fence against mos­qui­toes and sand­flies, and to take mini por­ta­ble fans to beat the hu­mid­ity.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>JAZZ UP THE FOOD</p>
    <p>Ms Si­ti­s­arah Sham­sudin, founder of Love4pic­nic & Glamp­ing As­so­ciate, sug­gests cut­ting up fruit, such as ki­wifruit and pineap­ple, into pieces shaped like stars, moons and other ob­jects us­ing cookie cut­ters.</p>
    <p>If sand­wiches are too bor­ing, try fuss-free ke­babs in­stead, us­ing mi­crowav­able sa­tay sold at su­per­mar­kets, she sug­gests. Pasta salad is also easy to pre­pare by adding olives, onions and cu­cum­ber, and is por­ta­ble – just driz­zle with a light lemony dress­ing and tuck in.</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>SET THE STAGE</p>
    <p>Ms Si­ti­s­arah sug­gests spread­ing out old bed sheets, du­vets or over­sized tow­els on the ground for a lux­u­ri­ous feel. Keep decor to a pas­tel pal­ette and a max­i­mum of three colours to make the colour scheme easy on the eye, she adds.</p>
    <p>Try mak­ing sim­ple ban­ners by print­ing out let­ters and past­ing them on card­board. Tie these dec­o­ra­tions be­tween some trees.</p>
