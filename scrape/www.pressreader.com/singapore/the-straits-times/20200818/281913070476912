    <p>BANGKOK • More than 10,000 peo­ple on Sun­day joined the big­gest protest in Thai­land since a 2014 coup to de­mand that the govern­ment step down and bring in a new Con­sti­tu­tion for fresh elec­tions.</p>
    <p>Some pro­test­ers are also push­ing for re­forms to the monar­chy – un­til re­cently a taboo sub­ject.</p>
    <p>HOW DID THE PROTESTS START?</p>
    <p>Anti-govern­ment protests first emerged late last year af­ter courts banned Fu­ture For­ward, the most vo­cal party op­pos­ing the govern­ment of former junta leader Prayut Chan-o-cha and one that drew strong sup­port among Thai youth.</p>
    <p>The protests went largely on­line while curbs were in place due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, but re-emerged in mid-July. Since then, demon­stra­tions or­gan­ised by stu­dent groups have taken place al­most daily.</p>
    <p>There was strong stu­dent rep­re­sen­ta­tion at the protest on Sun­day, but there were also many older peo­ple among the crowds.</p>
    <p>WHAT ARE PRO­TEST­ERS DE­MAND­ING?</p>
    <p>There are three key de­mands: For Mr Prayut’s govern­ment to step down, for a new Con­sti­tu­tion to be drawn up and for an end to the harassment of op­po­si­tion ac­tivists.</p>
    <p>But some stu­dents have also pre­sented 10 de­mands for re­forms to the pow­er­ful monar­chy of King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn.</p>
    <p>These in­clude curbs on his con­sti­tu­tional pow­ers and his author­ity over the palace for­tune and armed forces. They also want an end to the monar­chy’s role in pol­i­tics, but em­pha­sise they are not seek­ing to abol­ish it. Such pub­lic de­mands for change by any group are un­prece­dented in liv­ing mem­ory.</p>
    <p>WHAT IS DRIV­ING GRIEV­ANCES?</p>
    <p>Op­po­nents of Mr Prayut ac­cuse him of main­tain­ing the power he first seized in a 2014 coup through an elec­tion last year that was held un­der rules that favoured him. He dis­putes this.</p>
    <p>Other fac­tors have also emerged, in­clud­ing anger over ac­cu­sa­tions of govern­ment corruption and a feel­ing that the Thai elite acts with im­punity.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, poverty has been ex­ac­er­bated by the col­lapse of the cru­cial tourism in­dus­try as a re­sult of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The dis­ap­pear­ance of a Thai anti-govern­ment ac­tivist in Cam­bo­dia, the lat­est of nine to go miss­ing in re­cent years, has fu­elled dis­af­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Many young Thais also voice frus­tra­tion with an es­tab­lish­ment that em­pha­sises obe­di­ence to the au­thor­i­ties and tra­di­tion, with the monar­chy de­scribed by the Con­sti­tu­tion as “en­throned in a po­si­tion of revered wor­ship”.</p>
    <p>HOW HAS THE GOVERN­MENT RE­SPONDED?</p>
    <p>The govern­ment has said that peo­ple are al­lowed to show dis­sent and Mr Prayut has said he seeks di­a­logue with the pro­test­ers.</p>
    <p>But three stu­dent protest lead­ers have al­ready been ar­rested and re­leased on bail on charges over the ear­lier protests, and po­lice say there are war­rants for the ar­rest of a fur­ther 12.</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut has said the King has re­quested him not to use the lese ma­jeste laws that pro­vide for up to 15 years in prison for any­one in­sult­ing the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>WHAT OP­PO­SI­TION IS</p>
    <p>THERE TO THE PRO­TEST­ERS?</p>
    <p>There have been a hand­ful of promonar­chy demon­stra­tions to counter the anti-govern­ment protests, but even the big­gest has drawn no more than a few dozen peo­ple. Those have in­cluded former mem­bers of the strongly roy­al­ist “yel­low shirts”, who for more than a decade be­fore the last coup had clashed with “red shirt” pro­test­ers loyal to former pop­ulist prime min­is­ter Thaksin Shi­nawa­tra.</p>
    <p>Some former red shirts have mean­while ap­peared at the antigov­ern­ment protests.</p>
    <p>This has stirred con­cerns in Thai­land that there could be a re­turn to the street violence of the past, although so far the protests have been peace­ful.</p>
    <p>WHAT HAP­PENS NEXT?</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers have vowed to con­tinue tak­ing ac­tion un­til their de­mands are met.</p>
    <p>The protests, and par­tic­u­larly the crit­i­cism of the monar­chy, have put the govern­ment in a bind.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal an­a­lysts have said that if it acts too harshly, it risks pro­vok­ing a back­lash that will fur­ther en­cour­age sup­port for the protests.</p>
    <p>If it does not take strong ac­tion, how­ever, the pro­test­ers may be fur­ther em­bold­ened to break long­stand­ing taboos.</p>
