    <p>Brazil­ian po­lice ex­panded a long-run­ning cor­rup­tion probe at state-con­trolled oil com­pany Petroleo Brasileiro, or Petro­bras, based in part on se­cret record­ings made by a for­mer ex­ec­u­tive of Swiss trad­ing firm Vi­tol, ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments re­leased on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Po­lice on Tues­day served war­rants seek­ing doc­u­ments from six peo­ple and two com­pa­nies as part of what is known as the Car Wash probe into bribery to win con­tracts to buy and re­sell Petro­bras fuel.</p>
    <p>Pros­e­cu­tors al­lege that at least 12 million reais (S$2.9 million) had been paid be­tween 2005 and 2015 to Petro­bras em­ploy­ees work­ing in Hous­ton, Lon­don and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Tues­day’s probe ex­pands the reach of the in­ves­ti­ga­tion from oil and bunker fuel trades at Petro­bras’ of­fices i n Hous­ton and Rio de Janeiro to diesel and jet fuel there and in Europe and Asia.</p>
    <p>Petro­bras said in an e-mailed re­sponse it only learnt of Tues­day’s war­rants af­ter the po­lice op­er­a­tion was made pub­lic. Petro­bras said it was a vic­tim of cor­rupt em­ploy­ees and that it has co­op­er­ated with the au­thor­i­ties, pro­vid­ing in­for­ma­tion that led to the search war­rants.</p>
    <p>The search war­rants were ap­proved based in part on record­ings and other in­for­ma­tion pro­vided by Mar­cio Du­tra Gon­calves, a for­mer Vi­tol ex­ec­u­tive in Brazil, Judge Gabriela Hardt wrote in au­tho­ris­ing the po­lice search war­rants.</p>
    <p>Du­tra, who was Vi­tol’s Brazil chief ex­ec­u­tive in 2013, is co­op­er­at­ing with pros­e­cu­tors in ex­change for le­niency, the court said. He did not re­spond to mes­sages seek­ing com­ment. Vi­tol de­clined to com­ment on Tues­day. In the past, it has said it has a zero tol­er­ance pol­icy for bribery and cor­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>No new crim­i­nal charges were brought on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The in­ves­ti­ga­tion into al­leged kick­backs spans trades across four con­ti­nents. Car Wash be­gan in 2014 when a money laun­der­ing scheme was dis­cov­ered at a fuel sta­tion in Brazil’s cap­i­tal, Brasilia, that led to top ex­ec­u­tives at Petro­bras.</p>
    <p>Some of the for­mer Petro­bras staff and mid­dle men cited in pre­vi­ous phases of the probe tar­get­ing trad­ing firms have pleaded guilty and are co­op­er­at­ing with the au­thor­i­ties in ex­change for re­duced sen­tences, Reuters has re­ported.</p>
    <p>The trans­ac­tions be­ing re­viewed in­volved 3.3 bil­lion litres of fuel, pros­e­cu­tors said in a state­ment on Tues­day.</p>
