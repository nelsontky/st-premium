    <p>Con­sumers will soon be able to trans­fer funds from their bank ac­counts to mo­bile wal­lets, and be­tween e-wal­lets, in a faster and more has­sle-free way. This comes as two ma­jor funds trans­fer ser­vices are set to open to non-bank fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions from Fe­bru­ary, in a step to­wards mak­ing dig­i­tal pay­ments in Sin­ga­pore more seam­less.</p>
    <p>Con­sumers will soon be able to trans­fer funds from their bank ac­counts to mo­bile wal­lets, and be­tween such e-wal­lets, in a faster and more has­sle-free way.</p>
    <p>This comes as two ma­jor funds trans­fer ser­vices will open up to non-bank fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions (NFIs) from Fe­bru­ary, in a sig­nif­i­cant step to­wards mak­ing dig­i­tal pay­ments here more seam­less.</p>
    <p>NFIs that are li­censed as ma­jor pay­ment in­sti­tu­tions will be al­lowed to con­nect di­rectly to Fast (Fast And Se­cure Trans­fers) and PayNow, said the Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS).</p>
    <p>Th­ese NFIs in­clude Grab Fi­nan­cial Group, which op­er­ates mo­bile wal­let GrabPay; Razer Fin­tech, the fi­nan­cial tech­nol­ogy arm of gam­ing firm Razer; and e-wal­let Sing­tel Dash.</p>
    <p>The move will al­low users of NFI wal­lets to make real-time funds trans­fers be­tween their bank ac­counts and e-wal­lets, as well as be­tween var­i­ous e-wal­lets.</p>
    <p>Most e-wal­lets cur­rently re­quire users to top up their funds us­ing debit or credit cards, and do not al­low trans­fer of funds be­tween e-wal­lets. With the change, a cus­tomer can choose to trans­fer funds via Fast or PayNow from his mo­bile bank­ing app or In­ter­net bank­ing plat­form to top up his mo­bile wal­lets, in­stead of key­ing in his credit or debit card de­tails.</p>
    <p>MAS man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Ravi Menon said the move closes the “last-mile gap in Sin­ga­pore’s e-pay­ments jour­ney”. He added: “Con­sumers who may not have ready ac­cess to debit or credit cards to fund their e-wal­lets will now have the op­tion to do so di­rectly through their bank ac­counts.”</p>
    <p>Mer­chants are also ex­pected to ben­e­fit as they will have a larger mar­ket of con­sumers than be­fore for re­ceiv­ing pay­ments in­stantly, said Sin­ga­pore’s cen­tral bank.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses that part­ner any of the 23 Fast or nine PayNow banks, or e-wal­lets that have tra­di­tion­ally been closed-loop ecosys­tems, will soon be able to re­ceive real-time pay­ments from users of other e-wal­lets or mo­bile bank­ing ap­pli­ca­tions that will be join­ing Fast or PayNow.</p>
    <p>The nine par­tic­i­pat­ing PayNow banks are Bank of China, Citibank, DBS Bank, HSBC, the In­dus­trial and Com­mer­cial Bank of China, May­bank, OCBC Bank, Stan­dard Char­tered Bank, and United Over­seas Bank.</p>
    <p>As for the me­chan­ics of the ini­tia­tive, NFIs will be able to con­nect di­rectly through a new Ap­pli­ca­tion Pro­gram­ming In­ter­face (API) pay­ment gate­way de­vel­oped by the Di­rect Fast Work­ing Group.</p>
    <p>The group is guided by the Sin­ga­pore Clear­ing House As­so­ci­a­tion and the As­so­ci­a­tion of Banks in Sin­ga­pore (ABS), which gov­ern Fast and PayNow, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>ABS di­rec­tor Ong Ai-Boon said this is the first time the in­dus­try has opened ac­cess to th­ese two im­por­tant e-pay­ment plat­forms to non-banks.</p>
    <p>“Fast and PayNow adop­tion rates have ex­ceeded ex­pec­ta­tions, and we are con­fi­dent that the ad­di­tion of new play­ers will help ac­cel­er­ate the na­tional path to­wards a less-cash econ­omy,” said Mrs Ong.</p>
    <p>Trans­ac­tion vol­umes for Fast av­er­aged more than 12.5 mil­lion per month from July to Septem­ber. Monthly trans­ac­tion vol­umes for PayNow made up al­most half of all Fast trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Lawrence Chan, chair­man of Bank­ing Com­puter Ser­vices, which op­er­ates Fast and PayNow, said: “The suc­cess­ful launch of the API pay­ment gate­way is a sig­nif­i­cant mile­stone for Fast and PayNow, which are the foun­da­tion of in­stan­ta­neous, open and ac­ces­si­ble pay­ments.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore will be­come more com­pet­i­tive as a fin­tech hub once non­bank fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions (NFIs) are al­lowed to con­nect di­rectly to ma­jor funds trans­fer ser­vices Fast (Fast And Se­cure Trans­fers) and PayNow, ex­perts said.</p>
    <p>The move brings Sin­ga­pore a step closer to a con­ver­gence of banks and non-bank play­ers in of­fer­ing a uni­fied bank­ing sys­tem, said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lawrence Loh of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness School.</p>
    <p>It is also con­sis­tent with re­cent mea­sures to de­velop Sin­ga­pore’s dig­i­tal bank­ing scene, added Prof Loh. “You can see pieces of the puz­zle join­ing to­gether to lib­er­alise the bank­ing in­dus­try.”</p>
    <p>The Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore is ex­pected to is­sue up to two dig­i­tal full bank li­cences and three dig­i­tal whole­sale bank li­cences this month, al­low­ing even non­bank play­ers to con­duct dig­i­tal bank­ing busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Aurobindo Ghosh of Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity’s Lee Kong Chian School of Busi­ness said that open­ing up Fast and PayNow to NFIs will en­cour­age them to be more in­no­va­tive.</p>
    <p>“This might also catal­yse in­no­va­tion among tra­di­tional play­ers like banks to have wider and more in­no­va­tive of­fer­ings as usual bar­ri­ers to en­try to pro­tect their turf would be re­duced,” said Prof Ghosh.</p>
    <p>NFIs cheered the move to open up the pay­ment rails to them.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim Kell Jay, head of Grab Fi­nan­cial Group Sin­ga­pore, said:</p>
    <p>“The in­te­gra­tion of Fast and PayNow with GrabPay will greatly en­hance the pay­ments ex­pe­ri­ence by giv­ing con­sumers new ways to seam­lessly and se­curely top up and trans­act via GrabPay.”</p>
    <p>Like­wise, Razer Fin­tech chief ex­ec­u­tive Lee Li Meng said: “This con­certed push is a tes­ta­ment to Sin­ga­pore’s vi­brant and pro­gres­sive pay­ments ecosys­tem.”</p>
    <p>De­spite the greater com­peti</p>
    <p>tion, banks said the move will ben­e­fit Sin­ga­pore’s dig­i­tal pay­ments en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Des­mond Tan, head of group life­style fi­nanc­ing at OCBC, said that to achieve fi­nan­cial in­clu­sion, Sin­ga­pore must avoid frag­men­ta­tion by closed-loop app ecosys­tems.</p>
    <p>“We pre­fer open, na­tion­wide in­fra­struc­tures that have uni­ver­sal ac­cep­tance across Sin­ga­pore, and which mul­ti­ple bank users can ride on to­gether. This will spur Sin­ga­pore’s dig­i­tal pay­ments drive, and in­crease our cus­tomers’ con­ve­nience and adop­tion of dig­i­tal pay­ment so­lu­tions.”</p>
    <p>DBS Sin­ga­pore coun­try head Shee Tse Koon said: “Mak­ing Fast – a se­cure, in­stant pay­ment net­work – avail­able to a broader range of pay­ment providers, so both re­tail and cor­po­rate cus­tomers have more ways to adopt dig­i­tal pay­ments, is a pos­i­tive de­vel­op­ment we are proud to sup­port.”</p>
    <p>Like­wise, United Over­seas Bank (UOB) chief Wee Ee Cheong said the bank has cham­pi­oned open and in­ter­op­er­a­ble sys­tems as part of its com­mit­ment to im­prove dig­i­tal pay­ments.</p>
    <p>He said: “Through our on­go­ing in­no­va­tion drive at UOB and col­lab­o­ra­tion with like-minded in­dus­try play­ers, we will con­tinue to drive the adop­tion and us­age of dig­i­tal pay­ments in ar­eas that in­ter­sect with where our cus­tomers live, play and work.”</p>
