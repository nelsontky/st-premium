    <p>Pre-event test­ing for Covid-19 will be a re­quire­ment in some mass events in the months ahead, in a move that will bol­ster Sin­ga­pore’s fight against the coro­n­avirus as the na­tion re­sumes more ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Un­der a new pilot scheme, par­tic­i­pants will have to un­dergo anti­gen rapid tests, where re­sults are out in 30 min­utes.</p>
    <p>Those who ob­tain a neg­a­tive re­sult will be al­lowed to take part in the events.</p>
    <p>Those who test pos­i­tive must self-iso­late and go for a poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) con­fir­ma­tory swab, said the Health Min­istry yes­ter­day. They can­not leave their place of iso­la­tion un­til a neg­a­tive re­sult is re­ceived.</p>
    <p>Anti­gen rapid tests can be con­ducted at the event venue or at a sep­a­rate test­ing fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>The large-scale events will be iden­ti­fied by the Gov­ern­ment from this month to De­cem­ber, and will in­clude busi­ness-to-busi­ness events, wed­ding re­cep­tions, live per­for­mances and sports events.</p>
    <p>As part of this pilot scheme, the anti­gen rapid tests, and con­fir­ma­tory PCR tests if re­quired, will be pro­vided free of charge to the par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants in some mass events will have to take an anti­gen rapid test for Covid-19 and ob­tain a neg­a­tive re­sult be­fore ad­mis­sion to the events, un­der a new pilot pro­gramme meant to help Sin­ga­pore re­sume more ac­tiv­i­ties safely.</p>
    <p>Re­sults of anti­gen rapid tests are out within 30 min­utes and the tests can be con­ducted at the event venue, or off site at a sep­a­rate test­ing fa­cil­ity, the Min­istry of Health said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>For tests done off site, par­tic­i­pants have to pro­duce a cer­tifi­cate show­ing a neg­a­tive test re­sult, which is valid for a 24-hour time­frame in­clud­ing the du­ra­tion of the event.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants of multi-day events will have to un­dergo daily test­ing. Those at­tend­ing mul­ti­ple events within 24 hours need to go for only one test.</p>
    <p>As part of the pilot scheme, the anti­gen rapid tests will be pro­vided free of charge to par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>Those who test pos­i­tive must self-iso­late and go for a free poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) con­fir­ma­tory swab, said MOH. They can­not leave their place of iso­la­tion un­til a neg­a­tive re­sult is re­ceived.</p>
    <p>From this month to De­cem­ber, the Gov­ern­ment will iden­tify the events where anti­gen rapid test­ing is re­quired. Th­ese will in­clude wed­ding re­cep­tions, live per­for­mances and sports events, as well as busi­ness-to-busi­ness events such as the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional En­ergy Week next week, MOH said.</p>
    <p>“Pre-event test­ing pi­lots will en­able MOH to study pre-event test­ing pro­cesses and to iden­tify a model which can be im­ple­mented more widely and al­low more largescale events to re­sume even­tu­ally,” the min­istry added.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, na­tional swab­bing ex­er­cises make use of the “gold stan­dard” PCR tests, which are con­sid­ered the most ac­cu­rate. They de­tect the pres­ence of vi­ral ge­netic ma­te­rial in a sam­ple.</p>
    <p>But the en­tire process – swab­bing a pa­tient, send­ing the sam­ple to a lab­o­ra­tory and wait­ing for the re­sult – can take up to two days. The tests can also be costly, and re­quire trained per­son­nel and spe­cialised equip­ment to ad­min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Anti­gen rapid tests, on the other hand, are point-of-care tests that look for pro­teins on the virus sur­face. They are cheaper and yield quick re­sults.</p>
    <p>The test be­ing piloted in­volves us­ing a nasal swab to take a sam­ple from the lower part of the nose and should not be un­com­fort­able, MOH said.</p>
    <p>While other rapid tests are be­ing de­vel­oped, in­clud­ing a breathal­yser-type one that can yield re­sults in un­der one minute, the min­istry said it is cur­rently fo­cus­ing on the anti­gen rapid test.</p>
    <p>It noted that such tests may not be as ac­cu­rate as the PCR test. For ex­am­ple, they may not de­tect some Covid-19 pos­i­tive cases, or may show a pos­i­tive re­sult even though the per­son is healthy.</p>
    <p>MOH said: “As there is still a pos­si­bil­ity that a Covid-19 pos­i­tive case could slip through to at­tend the event, there is still a need for the same safe man­age­ment mea­sures to be put in place – in­clud­ing mask-wear­ing, safe dis­tanc­ing, group size and ca­pac­ity lim­its – to re­duce the risk of trans­mis­sion.”</p>
    <p>Those who test pos­i­tive in the anti­gen rapid test will have to go for a PCR test to de­ter­mine if they are re­ally in­fected.</p>
    <p>MOH said it has eval­u­ated the tests used in the pilot pro­gramme and they min­i­mally meet the rec­om­men­da­tions set out by the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>This means that the tests will be able to pick up at least 80 per cent of in­di­vid­u­als who are in­fected, and iden­tify 97 per cent of healthy in­di­vid­u­als as be­ing free from in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants will be in­formed by the event or­gan­iser on the spe­cific re­quire­ments for each pilot event.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, if test­ing is be­ing con­ducted at the event venue, par­tic­i­pants will likely have to ar­rive ear­lier to al­low for test­ing.</p>
