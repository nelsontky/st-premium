    <p>A small num­ber of em­ploy­ers have stepped up to hire peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties (PWDs), be­liev­ing such em­ploy­ment is good for their work­force and their busi­ness. More should be en­cour­aged to do so, says jour­nal­ist Goh Yan Han (be­low).</p>
    <p>Ms Ch­eryl Tan, 29, has been look­ing for a job for more than 18 months, send­ing out “count­less” ap­pli­ca­tions since she left her last job as a pa­tient ser­vice as­so­ciate at an eye clinic in Fe­bru­ary last year.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan, who has pro­gres­sive mul­ti­ple scle­ro­sis and moves around in a mo­torised wheel­chair, says that her dis­abil­ity has made it more dif­fi­cult to find a job. Add to that the cur­rent eco­nomic out­look as a re­sult of the pan­demic – and em­ploy­ment has been elu­sive.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan’s ex­pe­ri­ence re­flects the dif­fi­cul­ties faced by peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties (PWDs) look­ing for a job.</p>
    <p>With the pan­demic threat­en­ing many jobs and call­ing for a relook at the fu­ture of work, this is an op­por­tune time to look at ways to in­clude PWDs in the work­force of the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>In June, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob said as much when she high­lighted in a Face­book post the need for jobs for PWDs to be planned at the na­tional level and urged that PWDs be in­cluded in main­stream job cre­ation and job place­ment ef­forts. Her call is timely.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent em­ploy­ment rate of PWDs here is 28.6 per cent, ac­cord­ing to the lat­est data on the Min­istry of Man­power’s (MOM) web­site from its Com­pre­hen­sive Labour Force Sur­vey 2018. The pro­por­tion is cal­cu­lated out of all PWDs aged be­tween 15 and 64, and in­cludes those in full-time and part-time em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>How­ever, while it gives the em­ploy­ment rate, the to­tal num­ber of PWDs of work­ing age here is not dis­closed.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to MOM data, an­other 4.2 per cent of PWDs are un­em­ployed.</p>
    <p>The rest are con­sid­ered out­side the labour force for rea­sons such as poor health or dis­abil­ity, ed­u­ca­tion or train­ing-re­lated mat­ters, tak­ing a break or feel­ing dis­cour­aged.</p>
    <p>In com­par­i­son, Sin­ga­pore’s res­i­dent em­ploy­ment rate was 65.2 per cent last year.</p>
    <p>Help­ing PWDs find em­ploy­ment was an is­sue that came up in the de­bate last week on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party MP Ra­hayu Mahzam (Jurong GRC) said that it is not enough to in­cen­tivise em­ploy­ers to em­ploy PWDs. In­stead, con­ver­sa­tions about aware­ness and inclusivit­y must be en­cour­aged among em­ploy­ers and co-work­ers.</p>
    <p>Work­ers’ Party MP Ger­ald Giam (Alju­nied GRC) said that with mod­ern as­sis­tive tech­nol­ogy, PWDs can be as pro­duc­tive at work as their able-bod­ied col­leagues and sug­gested in­tro­duc­ing anti-dis­crim­i­na­tion leg­is­la­tion.</p>
    <p>PRO­FILES OF PWDS</p>
    <p>Un­der­stand­ing the de­mo­graph­ics of this group is help­ful in help­ing them in­te­grate into the work­force. Just who are the PWDs?</p>
    <p>In a Novem­ber 2018 an­swer to a par­lia­men­tary ques­tion, the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment (MSF) said that about half of an es­ti­mated 676,000 PWDs here have sen­sory dis­abil­i­ties such as be­ing blind or deaf, and phys­i­cal dis­abil­i­ties, while the rest com­prise those with in­tel­lec­tual dis­abil­i­ties, autism and other dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>About 9,660 were stu­dents then, while the rest were above the age of 18 and in­cluded those with dis­abil­i­ties in their old age who may not have been part of the labour force.</p>
    <p>MSF said then that it was work­ing with the De­part­ment of Sta­tis­tics to in­clude dis­abil­ity-re­lated ques­tions in a 2020 pop­u­la­tion cen­sus. Pro­files of PWDs are var­ied.</p>
    <p>Some have con­gen­i­tal dis­abil­i­ties or de­velop dis­abil­i­ties when they are young, while oth­ers in­cur dis­abil­i­ties ow­ing to ac­ci­dents, ill­nesses such as a stroke, or old age.</p>
    <p>Some have higher ed­u­ca­tional qual­i­fi­ca­tions, while oth­ers are more suited for sim­pler, rou­tine tasks.</p>
    <p>Mr Ab­hi­manyau Pal, chief ex­ec­u­tive of lo­cal dis­abil­ity-fo­cused char­ity SPD, which runs an em­ploy­ment sup­port pro­gramme, said a con­sid­er­able num­ber of its clients are ma­ture work­ers who have nec­es­sary work ex­pe­ri­ence but lack cer­tain in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy com­pe­ten­cies.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, they could have lo­gis­tics and re­tail ex­pe­ri­ence but might not be fa­mil­iar with on­line tools like video­con­fer­enc­ing plat­form Zoom.</p>
    <p>The char­ity in its last fi­nan­cial year suc­cess­fully placed 201 PWDs in jobs, out of the 381 it helped with job-seek­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Patricia Goh, a se­nior em­ploy­ment sup­port spe­cial­ist at SPD, said many clients pre­fer of­fice-based ad­min­is­tra­tive roles, while some join ac­coun­tancy, cy­ber se­cu­rity and data an­a­lyt­ics.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to MOM, about half of em­ployed PWDs here work in com­mu­nity, so­cial and per­sonal ser­vices; food and bev­er­age (F&B) ser­vices; ad­min­is­tra­tive and sup­port ser­vices and man­u­fac­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>Ex­am­ples of PWDs in the work­force in­clude some­one in a wheel­chair who works as a univer­sity teach­ing as­sis­tant, some­one with in­tel­lec­tual dis­abil­ity who cleans and does other rou­tine tasks at an F&B out­let, or some­one with hear­ing im­pair­ment who works in pub­lic re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Given the va­ri­ety and com­plex­ity of in­di­vid­ual PWDs and their needs, in­creas­ing their em­ploy­ment rate is not a straight­for­ward task.</p>
    <p>And yet, it is im­por­tant to raise the em­ploy­ment rate of PWDs who are ca­pa­ble of hold­ing down a job. It re­duces their de­pen­dence on state or com­mu­nity sup­port. As with their able-bod­ied peers, a job gives PWDs a sense of in­de­pen­dence, fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity and the abil­ity to con­trib­ute to so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>For 27-year-old Alis­ter Ong, who has cere­bral palsy and uses a wheel­chair, hav­ing a ca­reer gives him a sense of pur­pose. He works in the so­cial ser­vice sec­tor as an as­sis­tant man­ager, fa­cil­i­tat­ing re­la­tion­ships be­tween his or­gan­i­sa­tion and its part­ners.</p>
    <p>“I wanted a job that is mean­ing­ful, and it is this sense of pur­pose that keeps me go­ing,” said Mr Ong.</p>
    <p>EM­PLOY­ERS WHO HIRE PWDS</p>
    <p>While some PWDs in­ter­viewed en­counter em­ploy­ers who back out on hear­ing of their dis­abil­ity, some em­ploy­ers have hired PWDs ei­ther as part of their com­pa­nies’ di­ver­sity and in­clu­sive­ness ef­forts, or be­cause they be­lieve do­ing so im­proves the com­pany cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral em­ploy­ers told ST how they had re­designed roles and ad­justed the work­place to be PWD-friendly.</p>
    <p>Mr Ang Kian Peng, founder and di­rec­tor of Sam­sui Kitchen, hires more than 10 PWDs – about half of his staff – whose dis­abil­i­ties vary.</p>
    <p>Sam­sui Kitchen is the so­cial en­ter­prise arm of Soup Restau­rant, and is self-sus­tain­able, said Mr Ang.</p>
    <p>“I hire PWDs be­cause I think they can do a very good job, and it helps to fu­ture-proof our labour force – if a PWD can do it, we can give them the job op­por­tu­nity rather than hire a for­eigner,” he added.</p>
    <p>He al­lo­cates job scopes based on in­di­vid­ual strengths. One of his staff, who uses a wheel­chair, is adept at ad­min­is­tra­tive mat­ters and su­per­vises the other PWDs. Some with in­tel­lec­tual dis­abil­i­ties are fo­cused and good at repet­i­tive tasks – they help with mak­ing pas­tries.</p>
    <p>Sam­sui Kitchen’s space at the En­abling Vil­lage – a com­mu­nity space in Lengkok Bahru ded­i­cated to in­te­grat­ing PWDs into so­ci­ety – has been de­signed to make it safe for the PWDs and con­ducive to their work.</p>
    <p>The level of the work­sta­tions is lower, while the aisles are wide and the doors are slid­ing ones, to ac­com­mo­date wheel­chairs. The kitchen also does not have open fires as it uses in­duc­tion cook­ers.</p>
    <p>Though more re­sources are re­quired to train them, the ben­e­fits of hir­ing PWDs in­clude a kinder and more un­der­stand­ing pool of work­ers as well as more un­der­stand­ing cus­tomers. It also at­tracts more mil­len­ni­als aligned with the com­pany’s mis­sion to work with PWDs, said Mr Ang.</p>
    <p>Ms Rose Tan, owner of two vege­tar­ian Korean restau­rants – The Bone­less Kitchen in Tai Seng and Dae­hwa in one-north – hires four PWDs. One of them is deaf, one uses a wheel­chair, one has in­tel­lec­tual dis­abil­ity and an­other had had a stroke.</p>
    <p>“The truth is, there is a limit to how much they can do, but we un­der­stand that it is not pos­si­ble for any per­son to do ev­ery­thing. We de­sign the roles to suit what they are able to do,” said Ms Tan.</p>
    <p>Her first PWD hire in 2014, some months af­ter the restau­rant opened, was a man she knew who had cere­bral palsy. He was un­able to find a job de­spite be­ing hard-work­ing, said Ms Tan.</p>
    <p>She later de­cided to hire more PWDs.</p>
    <p>“Most of the time, run­ning a busi­ness is about dol­lars and cents. But when it comes to hir­ing PWDs, the ben­e­fits are in­tan­gi­ble,” said Ms Tan. It builds em­pa­thy and un­der­stand­ing among em­ploy­ees, and trans­lates to a bet­ter work­ing en­vi­ron­ment that also helps to re­tain work­ers, she added.</p>
    <p>Big­ger em­ploy­ers, such as cloth­ing re­tailer Uniqlo, also hire PWDs. Uniqlo has 31 em­ploy­ees with dis­abil­i­ties at its stores here.</p>
    <p>Ms Nur Atiqah Mo­hamed Ab­dul­lah, 29, a se­nior sus­tain­abil­ity ex­ec­u­tive, works with store man­agers to iden­tify strengths and con­sider new tasks for PWD col­leagues.</p>
    <p>“We should not un­der­es­ti­mate the po­ten­tial of these PWD col­leagues. While they may need a lit­tle more time to get used to their scope of work, we have ob­served that they are very metic­u­lous in their work once they are fa­mil­iar with the as­signed tasks,” said Ms Nur Atiqah.</p>
    <p>Their roles in­clude prod­uct un­pack­ing and re­plen­ish­ment, and en­sur­ing stores are kept clean.</p>
    <p>CAR­ING BOSSES</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said hav­ing ac­com­mo­dat­ing bosses makes a big dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>At one of his work­places, the of­fice changed the door on his floor to an au­to­matic one and in­stalled a sen­sor that he could reach with a spe­cially-as­signed RFID (ra­dio fre­quency iden­ti­fi­ca­tion) card.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the di­rec­tor gath­ered the team for a chat on his first day, as Mr Ong was the first PWD to join the de­part­ment. “It fa­cil­i­tated an open and au­then­tic en­vi­ron­ment,” said Mr Ong.</p>
    <p>Mr Sean Poh, who uses hear­ing aids, said he hoped to see ac­com­mo­dat­ing PWDs be­come an es­sen­tial part of the job ecosys­tem.</p>
    <p>He found his job in pub­lic re­la­tions in May, about 17 months af­ter grad­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“My boss was very wel­com­ing and got me a re­ally good speaker so I can hear the sounds bet­ter, es­pe­cially since our meet­ings are done vir­tu­ally now,” said Mr Poh, 27.</p>
    <p>Ms Goh added: “It is a big en­dorse­ment for PWDs, some of whom strug­gle with self-es­teem is­sues, to be hired, es­pe­cially if su­per­vi­sors help to shape the be­hav­iour of co-work­ers. It shows that they care.”</p>
    <p>While there are many pos­i­tive ex­am­ples of com­pa­nies hir­ing and in­te­grat­ing PWDs, more still needs to be done to im­prove Sin­ga­pore’s em­ploy­ment rate for PWDs.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan Ko We, SG En­able’s as­sis­tant chief ex­ec­u­tive, en­cour­aged em­ploy­ers to get a head start in learn­ing how to sup­port and in­ter­act with PWDs even amid the cur­rent eco­nomic down­turn.</p>
    <p>“When the econ­omy im­proves, they can then tap this tal­ent pool and hire them,” he said.</p>
    <p>SG En­able has de­vel­oped in­tern­ship and men­tor­ship op­por­tu­ni­ties and school-to-work pro­grammes, and works with part­ners to pro­vide pre-em­ploy­ment and in-em­ploy­ment train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties, said Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers who hire PWDs can tap the gov­ern­ment-funded Open Door Pro­gramme ad­min­is­tered by SG En­able that funds train­ing, work­place mod­i­fi­ca­tions, job re­design and pur­chase of as­sis­tive tech­nolo­gies to sup­port PWDs at work.</p>
    <p>Many Sin­ga­pore­ans want a fairer, more just and in­clu­sive so­ci­ety. In­te­grat­ing PWDs into the work­force is a step to­wards achiev­ing that goal.</p>
