    <p>SUS­TAIN­ABLE RE­COV­ERY NEEDED</p>
    <p>The re­cent pledges by China, Ja­pan and South Korea to go car­bon neu­tral are a ma­jor boost to global ac­tion on cli­mate change and could prompt other na­tions to back more am­bi­tious plans to cut car­bon emis­sions, the United Na­tions cli­mate chief has said.</p>
    <p>“The an­nounce­ments by these three coun­tries are re­ally very im­por­tant. And they come at a time when we need to see lead­er­ship in our process,” Ms Pa­tri­cia Espinosa, ex­ec­u­tive sec­re­tary of the UN Frame­work Con­ven­tion on Cli­mate Change, told The Straits Times from Bonn, in Ger­many.</p>
    <p>“I cer­tainly hope that many coun­tries will fol­low,” she added.</p>
    <p>“This is also im­por­tant be­cause we need to send the sig­nal right now that cli­mate change re­mains a pri­or­ity,” she said, adding that the threat from cli­mate change has not waned and that the Covid-19 pan­demic rep­re­sents a golden op­por­tu­nity to re­build economies that are greener and good for growth and jobs.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, China’s Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping sur­prised the world by set­ting 2060 as the tar­get for China to be car­bon neu­tral.</p>
    <p>Late last month, Ja­pan’s Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga set 2050 as his na­tion’s tar­get. Two days later, South Korea’s Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in made the same 2050 pledge.</p>
    <p>Car­bon neu­tral means dra­mat­i­cally re­duc­ing emis­sions of car­bon diox­ide, the main green­house gas heat­ing up the at­mos­phere. Any re­main­ing emis­sions need to be re­moved from the at­mos­phere us­ing tree plant­ing or other off­set­ting projects.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ments by the three coun­tries are cru­cial be­cause they are large car­bon pol­luters from us­ing fos­sil fu­els. China is the world’s top green­house gas pol­luter and top coal pro­ducer and con­sumer. Ja­pan is the fifth-largest car­bon pol­luter, while South Korea is 13th.</p>
    <p>The pledges are also key be­cause they un­der­score a grow­ing global shift to­wards cleaner en­ergy, a shift that has not been de­railed by the pan­demic, with a num­ber of na­tions back­ing green re­cov­ery pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>Cru­cially, the pledges come a year be­fore a ma­jor UN cli­mate con­fer­ence in Britain called COP26, which is meant to breathe life into the 2015 Paris Agree­ment in which nearly 200 na­tions agreed to limit global warm­ing to well be­low 2 deg C and aim for 1.5 deg C if pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>The world has al­ready warmed 1.1 deg C and weather-re­lated ex­tremes are in­ten­si­fy­ing. Record wild­fires have scarred east­ern Aus­tralia and the west coast of the United States this year, se­vere floods and storms have bat­tered Viet­nam and the Philip­pines and the US South has been hit by re­peated hur­ri­canes.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Paris pact, na­tions this year are meant to submit new or up­dated cli­mate plans to make deeper cuts to emis­sions this decade, a decade the UN says is crit­i­cal for avoid­ing the worst im­pacts of cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>“This decade will de­ter­mine the fate of hu­man­ity with re­spect to cli­mate change,” Ms Espinosa said, be­cause deep emis­sions cuts need to be made by 2030 to try to limit warm­ing to 1.5 deg C. Mid-cen­tury car­bon-neu­tral­ity pledges are vi­tal but so, too, are car­bon cuts be­fore then.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem, though, is that the global ap­petite for am­bi­tious cli­mate ac­tion has waned since the Paris deal was agreed, Ms Espinosa said. Last year’s UN cli­mate gath­er­ing in Madrid, called COP25, ended in only a wa­tered down agree­ment to make deeper car­bon cuts.</p>
    <p>The pledges by China, Ja­pan and South Korea have bright­ened hopes for more am­bi­tion, she said, adding that she was also en­cour­aged by the cli­mate plans of US Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic, too, has trig­gered a greater fo­cus on how the world needs to change.</p>
    <p>“I t hink t he ar­rival of t his Covid-19 cri­sis has re­ally ex­posed hu­man­ity’s greatest vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties and has mag­ni­fied its most ur­gent chal­lenges.”</p>
    <p>She said the pan­demic has cre­ated an op­por­tu­nity to ac­cel­er­ate the green tran­si­tion that has long been dis­cussed. Now there was an op­por­tu­nity to di­rect public money to­wards green in­dus­tries and green jobs and shift away from pol­lut­ing eco­nomic mod­els as part of na­tional eco­nomic re­cov­ery plans.</p>
    <p>“A re­cov­ery that is not sus­tain­able is not a re­cov­ery. Why would you call re­cov­ery some­thing that brings you back to a place where you are look­ing at so much suf­fer­ing, loss of hu­man lives? That’s not a re­cov­ery. That would be a set­back.”</p>
