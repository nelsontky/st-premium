    <p>TOKYO • Bad­minton world No. 1 Kento Mo­mota tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 yes­ter­day, prompt­ing the with­drawal of the Ja­panese na­tional team from the Jan 12-17 Thai­land Open.</p>
    <p>Na­tional broad­caster NHK said he tested pos­i­tive at Narita Air­port ahead of the team’s de­par­ture for Thai­land.</p>
    <p>An of­fi­cial from the Ja­pan Bad­minton As­so­ci­a­tion con­firmed that none of the other 22 Ja­panese play­ers tested pos­i­tive, but said the en­tire team would with­draw none­the­less.</p>
    <p>Its spokesman told Agence France-Presse: “Mo­mota has tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus, and the as­so­ci­a­tion has de­cided not to send any play­ers, in­clud­ing Mo­mota, to Thai­land.”</p>
    <p>Mo­mota had been look­ing for­ward to his in­ter­na­tional come­back in Bangkok af­ter al­most a year out fol­low­ing a car crash that left him with se­ri­ous in­juries.</p>
    <p>The 26-year-old won his first com­pe­ti­tion – the do­mes­tic All-Ja­pan cham­pi­onships – late last month since be­ing in­volved in an ac­ci­dent af­ter win­ning the Malaysia Mas­ters last Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>The crash killed the driver of the van that was tak­ing him to Kuala Lumpur In­ter­na­tional Air­port and left Mo­mota fear­ing for his ca­reer fol­low­ing a frac­tured eye socket.</p>
    <p>His in­jury cou­pled with the coro­n­avirus pan­demic meant last sea­son was a write-off, so the left-han­der, who won a record-break­ing 11 ti­tles in 2019, was keen to test him­self against top in­ter­na­tional play­ers in Bangkok.</p>
    <p>Mo­mota had been drawn to face 33rd-ranked Thai Khosit Phet­pardab in the first round and his pullout will be a big blow to Thai­land Open or­gan­is­ers.</p>
    <p>While the resched­uled Su­per 1000 tour­na­ment – it did not take place last year be­cause of the pan­demic – will be held be­hind closed doors and in bio-se­cure “bub­ble” con­di­tions, the ab­sence of the world cham­pion will likely hurt TV view­ing fig­ures.</p>
    <p>The Thai­land Open is set to be the first Bad­minton World Fed­er­a­tion World Tour event to be held in Asia since the Covid-19 shut­down in March.</p>
    <p>It is also one of three tour­na­ments tak­ing place in the coun­try this month, fol­low­ing mas­sive dis­rup­tions to last year’s sched­ule.</p>
