    <p>MANAMA • For­mula One cham­pion Lewis Hamil­ton has tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 and will miss the up­com­ing Sakhir Grand Prix in Bahrain, the sport’s gov­ern­ing body, the FIA, said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Bri­ton Hamil­ton, who has al­ready wrapped up his sev­enth world ti­tle and picked up his 11th win of the sea­son at Sun­day’s Bahrain Grand Prix, is iso­lat­ing with mild symp­toms but oth­er­wise fit and well, his Mercedes team said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“Lewis was tested three times last week and re­turned a neg­a­tive re­sult each time, the last of which was on Sun­day af­ter­noon at the Bahrain In­ter­na­tional Cir­cuit,” the Brack­ley-based team said.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, he woke up on Mon­day morn­ing with mild symp­toms and was in­formed at the same time that a con­tact prior to ar­rival in Bahrain had sub­se­quently tested pos­i­tive. Lewis there­fore took a fur­ther test and re­turned a pos­i­tive re­sult. This has since been con­firmed by a retest.”</p>
    <p>By miss­ing the penul­ti­mate race on the cal­en­dar, Hamil­ton will not be able to match the record for most wins in a sin­gle sea­son. Michael Schu­macher and Se­bas­tian Vet­tel share that mark with 13 wins, Schu­macher from 18 races in 2004 and Vet­tel from 19 in 2013.</p>
    <p>The sea­son will end with the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix at the Yas Ma­rina Cir­cuit on Dec 13. It is un­clear whether Hamil­ton will take part.</p>
    <p>Mercedes said they would an­nounce a re­place­ment driver for the Sakhir race in due course.</p>
    <p>Bel­gian Stof­fel Van­doorne, who races for the Mercedes For­mula E team and al­ready sched­uled to fly to Bahrain, and Mex­i­can Este­ban Gutierrez are the team’s re­serve driv­ers. They also have Bri­ton Ge­orge Rus­sell, who races for Wil­liams, on their books.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Nikita Mazepin, the son of a Rus­sian bil­lion­aire, will race for Haas next year af­ter agree­ing a multi-year deal, the US-based F1 team an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The 21-year-old is third in the For­mula Two stand­ings and is ex­pected to be joined at Haas next sea­son by F2 leader Mick Schu­macher, son of Fer­rari legend Michael. The F2 sea­son ends in Bahrain this week­end.</p>
    <p>Mazepin’s fa­ther Dmitry owns Rus­sian fer­tiliser maker Uralchem and tried to buy the Force In­dia team af­ter they went into ad­min­is­tra­tion in 2018, los­ing out to Cana­dian Lawrence Stroll.</p>
    <p>Haas an­nounced in Oc­to­ber that French driver Ro­main Gros­jean, in­volved in a fiery crash in Bahrain on Sun­day, and Den­mark’s Kevin Mag­nussen would both leave af­ter this sea­son.</p>
