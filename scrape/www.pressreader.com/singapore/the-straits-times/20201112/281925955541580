    <p>Hey, Joe!</p>
    <p>If that over-fa­mil­iar greet­ing sounds like the name of a song made fa­mous by Jimi Hen­drix, the con­nec­tion is de­lib­er­ate.</p>
    <p>For most of us raised in post-colo­nial Asia it was not Bri­tain, the for­mer colo­nial master, that served as our bea­con, but the coun­try you are des­tined to lead, the United States of Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>Your coun­try’s hard power re­mains un­matched, but it is its soft power that drew us to Amer­ica more. In my case, that in­cluded a visit to Zob­tronix, the shop that once stood on Seat­tle’s Uni­ver­sity Av­enue where Hen­drix bought gui­tars, a drive past the Ever­glades to drink at Sloppy Joe’s Bar in Key West, Florida, a favoured hang­out of Ernest Hem­ing­way, and a road jour­ney into Kentucky to visit the sta­bles of the great race horse Sec­re­tar­iat, winner of the 1973 Triple Crown.</p>
    <p>Give me a swag­ger stick to hold and I can do a fair im­i­ta­tion of Gen­eral Ge­orge Pat­ton’s “no bas­tard ever won a war by dy­ing for his coun­try” speech to the Third Army in 1944, prior to the Al­lied in­va­sion of France.</p>
    <p>The Bard’s home in Stratford-upon-Avon or Liver­pool’s Penny Lane, scene of the Bea­tles’ grow­ing up years, were draws as well, but they had lesser pri­or­ity than Amer­ica’s icons when it came to the urge to get to them. Many of us knew more about the Ap­palachian Moun­tains than we did about our own</p>
    <p>Visayas. We ac­cepted, some­times un­think­ingly, that “free­dom” as Amer­ica de­fined it was im­por­tant to us as well and that the causes it es­poused were some­how ours too, even if so dis­tant.</p>
    <p>Sim­ply stated, the US, for those of us who once thought we stood on lower ground, was the “city upon the hill” in so many ways.</p>
    <p>To­day, we can look Amer­ica in the eye but that coun­try we ad­mired – it didn’t need the pre­fix “Great” be­fore it to em­pha­sise its place in the world – has been miss­ing, par­tic­u­larly in th­ese past four years of Trumpian pres­i­den­tial pique and peev­ish­ness. Long­stand­ing al­lies such as Ja­pan and South Korea look askance at the de­mands to pay up or put up. Amer­ica with­drew from the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship Agree­ment and World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion. It even threat­ened to leave the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO), some­thing it helped build, if the WTO did not meet de­mands for the US to be des­ig­nated a “de­vel­op­ing coun­try” along the lines of China and In­dia!</p>
    <p>The at­tacks on glob­al­i­sa­tion, the thinly veiled dis­trust of im­mi­grants in a na­tion of im­mi­grants, and the bla­tant play to ma­jori­tar­ian sen­ti­ments th­ese past four years have been as­tound­ing for those of us who saw Amer­ica as epit­o­mis­ing the val­ues of lib­er­a­tion, free­dom, equal­ity and res­cue.</p>
    <p>Frankly, we’d be­gun to sense some of this con­fu­sion and na­tional fa­tigue even while you held the vice-pres­i­dency un­der Mr Barack Obama – US ten­sions with the WTO, for in­stance, date to that time, and ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Some might even say the fevered brain was ev­i­dent when your na­tion un­der Mr Ge­orge W. Bush waged a wholly mis­guided war on Iraq and de­liv­ered a crude hang­man’s jus­tice to its strong­man leader Sad­dam Hus­sein. Cer­tainly, it set off a chain of events that would un­set­tle all of West Asia, with spillover ef­fects for the rest of the world, your mil­i­tary in­cluded.</p>
    <p>Per­haps we were too po­lite to men­tion it then. We know the US blun­ders, and of­ten. But we also know it is ca­pable of self-cor­rect­ing and that it mostly means well. Be­sides, it was al­ways com­fort­ing to have it around; as Gen­eral Pat­ton told his troops, Amer­i­cans have never lost be­cause the very thought of los­ing was hate­ful to Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>INDO-PA­CIFIC PRES­I­DENT</p>
    <p>To­day, while we wel­come your rise to the high­est of­fice – so many Asian lead­ers have known you at some point or the other over the past four decades – we are more than a lit­tle un­sure about the US re­solve to never lose. This, even as we strug­gle to cope with an­other su­per­power at our doorstep, one whose rise is both daz­zling in its size and scope, and vex­ing in its im­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>So, here’s the thing. If you are con­vinced that it is in Amer­ica’s in­ter­ests to be en­trenched in this re­gion, there are a few things you might con­sider do­ing.</p>
    <p>Start by an­nounc­ing your­self as the first Indo-Pa­cific pres­i­dent, in the same way that the Hawaii-born Mr Obama held him­self up as the first Pa­cific pres­i­dent. Your claims would be cred­i­ble: your an­ces­tors ap­par­ently served in the Bri­tish East In­dia Com­pany and, what’s more, Vice-Pres­i­dent-elect</p>
    <p>Ka­mala Har­ris draws half her lin­eage from south­ern In­dia. Be­sides, you were vice-pres­i­dent your­self when the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion fash­ioned its “pivot to Asia” and sub­se­quently re­branded it as a “re­bal­ance”.</p>
    <p>Se­condly, it ap­pears that you in­tend to an­nounce that the US is re­turn­ing to the Paris Agree­ment on cli­mate change as a sig­na­ture state­ment of your ad­min­is­tra­tion. Good idea. Si­mul­ta­ne­ously, also con­sider an­nounc­ing that the US will restart ne­go­ti­a­tions on join­ing the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship (CPTPP), as the de­funct Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship is now called.</p>
    <p>You need to do this to es­tab­lish to Asia, es­pe­cially East Asia, that the US has a vi­sion for this re­gion that goes be­yond merely at­tempt­ing to put a pair of iron bracelets on China’s wrists – a fu­tile en­deav­our in any case be­cause it is now be­yond your power to do so.</p>
    <p>Stress­ing cli­mate change sug­gests you see scope to co­op­er­ate with China. CPTPP sig­nals re­solve to stand your ground with it on core is­sues of con­cern.</p>
    <p>RCEP v CPTPP</p>
    <p>There’s only so much time. This week­end, the re­gion’s re­la­tion­ship with China, its largest trad­ing part­ner, is set to fur­ther ma­ture when 15 na­tions, in­clud­ing all 10 Asean states, sign the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (RCEP) agree­ment.</p>
    <p>Even as we are ex­cited about its po­ten­tial, many of us, in­clud­ing in Ja­pan and South Korea, are wary of be­ing over­run by the power and mo­men­tum of Chi­nese man­u­fac­tur­ing. There also is fear that in time it will mean be­ing dom­i­nated by China it­self, even though RCEP is an Asean-driven ini­tia­tive. In­deed, reg­u­lar RCEP sum­mits are even a pos­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>The RCEP struc­ture pre­cludes your pres­ence in those coun­cils but you have the op­tion of par­tic­i­pat­ing in an al­ter­na­tive, higher-qual­ity ar­range­ment that is the CPTPP.</p>
    <p>Even if it may ap­pear po­lit­i­cally fraught for the mo­ment, do know that peo­ple have a way of com­ing to ac­cept un­pop­u­lar de­ci­sions if they sense you are act­ing with the right mo­tives. That is the les­son be­queathed by Mr Lee Kuan Yew, whom you un­fail­ingly never omit­ted to meet when he dropped by the Se­nate on his trips to Washington.</p>
    <p>There’s an­other is­sue you have high­lighted for pri­or­ity at­ten­tion, Rus­sia. Ties with Moscow seem to have gone badly wrong de­spite Mr Obama’s stated in­ten­tion for a re­set. With your long ex­pe­ri­ence in the Se­nate For­eign Re­la­tions Com­mit­tee, as well your pre­vi­ous stint in ad­min­is­tra­tion, you would surely know that the US must share the blame for this.</p>
    <p>It was your Cabinet col­league, Sec­re­tary of State Hil­lary Clin­ton’s un­wise at­tempts to in­ter­fere in Rus­sian pol­i­tics that ex­ac­er­bated in­se­cu­ri­ties in Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin that would prove costly for neigh­bour­ing coun­tries like Ukraine.</p>
    <p>Not just in Europe, the re­ver­ber­a­tions man­i­fested all the way out East – Rus­sia has more ter­ri­tory in Asia than in Europe and parks a ma­jor­ity of its naval as­sets here. Asia needs a sta­ble, neu­tral Rus­sia, not one pushed by Amer­i­can hos­til­ity to em­brace al­ter­na­tive strate­gic ar­range­ments that could, ul­ti­mately, come back to haunt you.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, a word on hu­man rights. Both you and Ms Har­ris set much store by this, and why not. The Trump years saw the cod­dling of dic­ta­tors, many of whom wan­tonly trod on the hu­man rights of their own peo­ple. Just don’t be par­tial in go­ing about it; if you want to take on Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping over Mus­lim Uighurs, by all means do so. But do not forget to also call out Myan­mar’s State Coun­sel­lor Aung San Suu Kyi on the Ro­hingya or Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi on the In­dian gov­ern­ment’s ma­jori­tar­ian in­stincts.</p>
    <p>The un­even ap­pli­ca­tion of uni­ver­sal prin­ci­ples at the al­tar of ex­pe­di­ency di­min­ishes Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>There’s so much the US could do in part­ner­ship with Asia in the four years ahead. Vac­cine de­vel­op­ment, pro­duc­tion and dis­tri­bu­tion with­out in­sist­ing on wind­fall gains for US phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies would res­onate on a scale match­ing the help Amer­ica ren­dered South-east Asia in the af­ter­math of the 2004 tsunami or in the wake of Ty­phoon Haiyan that dev­as­tated the Philip­pines nine years later.</p>
    <p>More than the B-1 strate­gic bombers you can fly over the South China Sea or the car­rier groups you sail through the re­gion, it is Amer­i­can self­less­ness that res­onates the most. We hope you will keep it go­ing be­cause this is not the last virus that will ter­rorise us, or the last nat­u­ral dis­as­ter we will need to en­dure.</p>
    <p>We do look for­ward to see­ing you soon in our neigh­bour­hood. And a US am­bas­sador in sta­tion in Sin­ga­pore at the ear­li­est. We have been miss­ing one for four years.</p>
