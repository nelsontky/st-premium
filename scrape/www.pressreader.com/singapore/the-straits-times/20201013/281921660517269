    <p>A 17-year old girl from Texas has made it into the Guin­ness World Records 2021 as hav­ing the world’s long­est legs for a fe­male, and the long­est legs on a teenager.</p>
    <p>Maci Cur­rin from Cedar Park, stands at 2.08m. Her legs make up 60 per cent of her to­tal height, ac­cord­ing to the Guin­ness World Records’ web­site.</p>
    <p>Her left leg mea­sures 135.3cm, and her right leg mea­sures 134.3cm.</p>
    <p>Though Maci’s fam­ily mem­bers are rel­a­tively tall, none of her sib­lings or par­ents come close to her height.</p>
    <p>She said that hav­ing such long legs come with both ben­e­fits and chal­lenges – in­clud­ing the re­ac­tions of those around her.</p>
    <p>“I was never bul­lied for my legs... I was bul­lied be­cause I was taller than ev­ery­one,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Around sopho­more year I just stopped car­ing what peo­ple thought of me and once I just stopped car­ing I wasn’t af­fected by any­thing,” she told the web­site.</p>
    <p>She said she some­times finds it hard to fit through door­ways, get into cars, or have clothes that fit her prop­erly.</p>
    <p>In fact, she first re­alised that she had longer than av­er­age legs in 2018, when some­one asked her if she wanted a cus­tom pair of leg­gings af­ter she was un­able to find any that fit­ted her.</p>
    <p>Her height helps her when it comes to play­ing on her high school’s vol­ley­ball team, Guin­ness World Records re­ports.</p>
    <p>In the future she hopes to go to col­lege in the UK and achieve the record for be­ing the world’s tallest pro­fes­sional model.</p>
