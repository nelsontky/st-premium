    <p>Timo Werner and Roberto Firmino fea­tured in dif­fer­ent leagues last sea­son, with the Ger­man in the Bun­desliga and the Brazil­ian in the Premier League. But Werner showed his ef­fi­ciency as a striker can­not be over­looked. Here is a look at their key sta­tis­tics last term.</p>
    <p>LON­DON Timo Werner could have been in Liver­pool red today. In­stead, he will be in Chelsea blue, de­ter­mined to show the English Premier League cham­pi­ons what they missed out on.</p>
    <p>The Mersey­side club baulked at the £53 mil­lion (S$93.1 mil­lion) fee that Chelsea paid RB Leipzig but made Diogo Jota their fourth-most ex­pen­sive player yes­ter­day. Liver­pool signed the Wolves for­ward on a five-year deal for £41 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old can play any­where along the front line. He also boasts a work rate and abil­ity to press that Jur­gen Klopp de­mands.</p>
    <p>Jota, who scored 44 times in 131 ap­pear­ances for Wolves, will be a back-up op­tion to Roberto Firmino, Mo­hamed Salah and Sa­dio Mane – a role Werner was not keen on. With Blues boss Frank Lampard con­vinc­ing Werner that he would be his first-choice striker, the Ger­man in­ter­na­tional joined the Lon­don club.</p>
    <p>“There were some other clubs that I talked to... like Liver­pool, who have a great team. But at the end I de­cided (to move to) Chelsea,” said Werner.</p>
    <p>“Not only be­cause of the style of foot­ball but also be­cause of what they have shown to me...</p>
    <p>“I’m look­ing for­ward to play­ing Liver­pool. There are a lot of good teams in the league but Liver­pool are one of the best in the world.</p>
    <p>“It will be a good chal­lenge to show how far we have come. We will try to win the game, but the whole of Liver­pool’s de­fence is good. We also have great play­ers and we have the qual­ity to beat them.”</p>
    <p>Werner, scorer of 34 goals for Leipzig last sea­son, suf­fered a dead leg in Chelsea’s sea­son open­ing 3-1 win against Brighton. But he will be ready for his Stam­ford Bridge de­but af­ter i mpress­ing in win­ning a penalty last week.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, Firmino was off colour in Liver­pool’s 4-3 win over Leeds. Liver­pool’s No. 9 scored just nine league goals last sea­son but Klopp val­ues his link-up play with Salah and Mane.</p>
    <p>Still, for­mer Reds striker John Aldridge be­lieves that com­pe­ti­tion could help boost Firmino’s pro­duc­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>He told the Liver­pool Echo: “Bobby Firmino still seems to have the shack­les around him a lit­tle bit... in the box at An­field it wasn’t hap­pen­ing for him... I can’t help but feel it might do Bobby some good if he did have some­one breath­ing down his neck for his place so he knows he’s got to score goals.”</p>
    <p>That Werner was just one of five ma­jor sum­mer sign­ings for Chelsea has added ex­tra spice to today’s fix­ture fol­low­ing a feisty ex­change be­tween the man­agers over trans­fer spend­ing.</p>
    <p>Klopp point­edly said that dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic that Liver­pool could not spend in the same way as clubs owned by “coun­tries” and “oli­garchs” such as Chelsea, who splashed out around £200 mil­lion on new play­ers.</p>
    <p>Lampard, who also be­came em­broiled in a spat with Liver­pool’s bench in July, high­lighted that the An­field side had spent big in pre­vi­ous sea­sons as they built their ti­tlewin­ning side.</p>
    <p>His re­tort came when Liver­pool re­mained rel­a­tively quiet, adding just Greece left-back Kostas</p>
    <p>Tsimikas to their squad. But on a whirl­wind Fri­day, the Reds agreed to terms on the Jota deal hours af­ter the ar­rival of Spain mid­fielder Thi­ago Al­can­tara for an ini­tial £20 mil­lion fee.</p>
    <p>Although the Por­tuguese will cost the club less than only Vir­gil van Dijk (£75 mi l l i o n ) , A l i s s o n (£66.8 mil­lion), and Naby Keita (£45 mil­lion), Liver­pool have struc­tured the deal cre­atively.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to The Ath­letic, Wolves have al­lowed Liver­pool to pay just 10 per cent of the guar­an­teed fee over the next 12 months.</p>
    <p>More­over, the net spend will be closer to £30 mil­lion, with 18-yearold de­fender Ki-Jana Ho­ever go­ing the other way for £9 mil­lion and a pos­si­ble £4.5 mil­lion in add-ons.</p>
    <p>Thi­ago is un­likely to fea­ture for the vis­i­tors today, but could make his Premier League de­but when Liver­pool host Arse­nal on Sept 28.</p>
    <p>Lampard will be with­out new boys Thi­ago Silva, Ben Chilwell and Hakim Ziyech today due to fit­ness is­sues while Chris­tian Pulisic has also been ruled out.</p>
