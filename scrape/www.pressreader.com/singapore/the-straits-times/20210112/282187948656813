        <p>Home-grown chain Founder Bak Kut Teh, which had four out­lets a year ago, is now left with just two – its Balestier Road flag­ship store and a branch at Down­town East in Pasir Ris.</p>
        <p>It closed its out­let i n North Bridge Road op­po­site Bugis Junc­tion at the end of Oc­to­ber. And the one in Ho­tel Boss in Jalan Sul­tan was shut­tered on Dec 31.</p>
        <p>Founder Bak Kut Teh was started in 1978 by Mr Chua Ch­wee Whatt in a cof­fee shop in Choa Chu Kang and moved to Balestier Road in 1998.</p>
        <p>Sec­ond-gen­er­a­tion owner Nigel Chua, 45, who had started help­ing his fa­ther since he was young, said busi­ness at the two closed out­lets was badly af­fected by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
        <p>He added: “The Bugis out­let de­pended mainly on tourists and the of­fice crowd, both of which were non-ex­is­tent in Oc­to­ber. And 90 per cent of the din­ers at Ho­tel Boss were tourists.”</p>
        <p>He had sent out an ap­peal on so­cial me­dia on July 15 last year to save the chain, but it was met with a mix of sup­port and crit­i­cism.</p>
        <p>Some ne­ti­zens rooted for him but oth­ers called it a shame­less pub­lic­ity stunt.</p>
        <p>In his post, Mr Chua said the brand was in dan­ger of clos­ing in the fol­low­ing two months as busi­ness had plum­meted by 85 per cent over the past five months.</p>
        <p>Busi­ness im­proved slightly af­ter the ap­peal but quickly plunged again.</p>
        <p>Mr Chua said the two re­main­ing out­lets are strug­gling too, with busi­ness at only 20 to 30 per cent of what it was dur­ing pre-Covid times. He will de­cide at the end of this week if he will close the Pasir Ris branch. His con­tract with Down­town East will end in the mid­dle of March.</p>
        <p>But he plans to keep the Balestier Road flag­ship run­ning. “Hope­fully, things will pick up af­ter Chi­nese New Year,” he said.</p>
        <p>Founder Bak Kut Teh also has over­seas fran­chises in places like In­done­sia, Viet­nam, Tai­wan and China.</p>
        <p>While Mr Chua is not in­volved in their op­er­a­tions, he said that, ex­cept for Tai­wan, most of them are not do­ing well.</p>
        <p>“In­done­sia is af­fected be­cause of the lock­down. China is not do­ing well ei­ther. And one of the two out­lets in Viet­nam is clos­ing at the end of this month,” he said.</p>
