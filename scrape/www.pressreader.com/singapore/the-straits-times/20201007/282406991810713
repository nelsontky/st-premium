    <p>The £45 mil­lion (S$79.3 mil­lion) Arsenal shelled out for Thomas Partey on Mon­day could prove to be a bar­gain, for­mer Gun­ners for­ward Paul Mer­son has said.</p>
    <p>Mer­son added that the 27-yearold Ghana­ian mid­fielder, who ar­rived from Atletico Madrid in what was the big­gest move on trans­fer dead­line day, would bring dis­ci­pline and qual­ity to the side.</p>
    <p>“I think Thomas Partey is a top drawer player. I nearly fell off my chair with £45 mil­lion, I don’t think that’s a lot of money at all for the qual­ity of player,” Mer­son, who played for Arsenal be­tween 1985-97, told Sky Sports.</p>
    <p>“One thing he brings as well is dis­ci­pline. Atletico Madrid are prob­a­bly one of the most dis­ci­plined teams in Europe and he will do that.</p>
    <p>“He’s not a mid­fielder that goes run­ning all over the place... I think he will be a great sign­ing.”</p>
    <p>Partey has been a long-term tar­get for the Gun­ners, who ac­ti­vated his re­lease clause in hopes of bol­ster­ing their op­tions in cen­tral mid­field.</p>
    <p>“He is a dy­namic mid­fielder with great en­ergy. He brings a lot of ex­pe­ri­ence from a top club that has com­peted at the high­est level in La Liga and the Cham­pi­ons League for sev­eral years,” said Arsenal man­ager Mikel Arteta.</p>
    <p>Uruguayan in­ter­na­tional Lu­cas Tor­reira has gone the other way on a sea­son-long loan deal.</p>
    <p>Arsenal have made an im­pres­sive start to the sea­son, win­ning three of their open­ing four Premier League games, as they aim to re­turn to the Cham­pi­ons League next sea­son for the first time in five years.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Lon­don­ers have been short in mid­field with Me­sut Ozil and Mat­teo Guen­douzi, who has joined Hertha Berlin on a sea­son-long loan, frozen out by Arteta.</p>
    <p>Partey was part of the Atletico sides that reached the 2016 Cham­pi­ons League fi­nal and beat Arsenal on the way to win­ning the Europa League in 2018.</p>
    <p>A tough-tack­ling mid­fielder with an eye for goal, he scored 16 times in 188 ap­pear­ances for Atletico since break­ing into the first team in 2015.</p>
    <p>“He is a leader on and off the pitch, and he is ex­actly the kind of player we want at the club,” said Arsenal’s tech­ni­cal di­rec­tor Edu.</p>
    <p>“With his all-round game and pos­i­tive ag­gres­sive style, he will be a bril­liant ad­di­tion to our squad.”</p>
    <p>Partey will join up with his new team­mates next week af­ter he re­turns from in­ter­na­tional duty.</p>
    <p>Arsenal have also signed Wil­lian, Pablo Mari, Cedric Soares, Gabriel Ma­gal­haes and Dani Ce­bal­los as they bid to im­prove on their eighth­placed fin­ish last sea­son.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, fel­low Premier League club Manch­ester United were also busy on trans­fer dead­line day with four new sign­ings.</p>
    <p>United signed vet­eran Uruguayan striker Edin­son Ca­vani on a free trans­fer, Brazil­ian left­back Alex Telles from Porto, Uruguayan 18-year-old winger Fa­cundo Pel­listri and also reached an agree­ment to sign Ata­lanta’s teenage winger Amad Diallo.</p>
    <p>Ca­vani, 33, and Telles, 27, are set to be in­te­grated into the first team.</p>
    <p>Pel­listri joined from Club Atletico Pe­narol on a five-year con­tract, with an op­tion to ex­tend for a fur­ther year. The speedy teenager has fea­tured 37 times for the Uruguayan Primera Di­vi­sion club and will go into United’s youth team. Highly-rated Ivo­rian Diallo, 18, whose sign­ing could cost United up to £37 mil­lion in­clud­ing ad­dons, will not join un­til Jan­uary due to work per­mit is­sues.</p>
    <p>ALL-ROUND GAME</p>
    <p>He is a dy­namic mid­fielder with great en­ergy. He brings a lot of ex­pe­ri­ence from a top club that has com­peted at the high­est level.</p>
