    <p>A move by the Alju­nied-Hougang Town Coun­cil (AHTC) to amend its claims in a long-run­ning court case is “prej­u­di­cial” and an abuse of the court process, said lawyers rep­re­sent­ing town coun­cil­lors from the Work­ers’ Party (WP).</p>
    <p>WP chief Pri­tam Singh, party chair­man Sylvia Lim and for­mer party chief Low Thia Khi­ang, along with the two other town coun­cil­lors who were taken to court by the town coun­cil, have op­posed the amend­ment in sub­mis­sions re­leased on­line yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The five de­fen­dants noted that the trial is al­ready over, and judg­ment has al­ready been de­liv­ered.</p>
    <p>They also said the amend­ments AHTC wants to make are in­tended to take ad­van­tage of the or­ders made in the High Court judg­ment re­leased last Oc­to­ber, which also cov­ered a par­al­lel law­suit brought by the Pasir Ris-Pung­gol Town Coun­cil (PRPTC) against the five de­fen­dants and oth­ers.</p>
    <p>This is the lat­est de­vel­op­ment in the court case, which is now be­fore the Court of Ap­peal.</p>
    <p>AHTC, act­ing through an independen­t panel, had taken the five town coun­cil­lors, along with their man­ag­ing agent FM So­lu­tions and Ser­vices (FMSS) and the com­pany’s own­ers, to court over $33 mil­lion in im­proper pay­ments that the town coun­cil made un­der their watch.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Kan­nan Ramesh had found Ms Lim and Mr Low in breach of their fidu­ciary du­ties to­wards AHTC in award­ing a con­tract to FMSS with­out call­ing a ten­der.</p>
    <p>It also found Mr Singh and the other two town coun­cil­lors, Mr Ken­neth Foo and Mr Chua Zhi Hon, in breach of their duty of skill and care.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court pa­pers filed by AHTC lawyers Shook Lin & Bok, the town coun­cil is seek­ing to add to the claims against Mr Singh, Mr Chua, Mr Foo and Ms How Weng Fan, the owner of FMSS, who is also rep­re­sent­ing the es­tate of her late hus­band Danny Loh.</p>
    <p>AHTC’s claims against Mr Singh, Mr Chua and Mr Foo were fo­cused on sev­eral spe­cific con­tracts, while its claims against Ms How were fo­cused on breaches of fidu­ciary duty.</p>
    <p>Now, AHTC is also seek­ing to claim against them for breaches of a duty to ex­er­cise due skill and care to­wards the town coun­cil.</p>
    <p>In con­test­ing this, lawyers from Tan Ra­jah and Cheah, rep­re­sent­ing the WP town coun­cil­lors, and Netto and Ma­gin, rep­re­sent­ing Ms How, said in sep­a­rate sub­mis­sions that AHTC was at­tempt­ing to “take a se­cond bite of the cherry”.</p>
    <p>Lawyers for the WP town coun­cil­lors ar­gued that AHTC had the in­for­ma­tion it needed to make the claims pre­vi­ously, but had not done so, and said the town coun­cil had also run its case ac­cord­ing to its orig­i­nal claims over a span of two years from July 2017 un­til last Oc­to­ber, when the judg­ment was re­leased.</p>
    <p>They also said the ap­pli­ca­tion was a “bla­tant at­tempt” to ben­e­fit from the find­ings in the judg­ment in re­la­tion to the par­al­lel law­suit brought by PRPTC.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing had sight of the judg­ment, AHTC is clearly at­tempt­ing to have a se­cond bite at the cherry,” the WP town coun­cil­lors’ lawyers said, adding that this is an abuse of the process of the court.</p>
    <p>The lawyers ar­gued that there was a time limit for mak­ing the claims that the town coun­cil wants to add on through the amend­ment.</p>
    <p>When AHTC first filed the law­suit in 2017, it would have been in time to make the claims, but it was now too late, they said.</p>
    <p>An­other ar­gu­ment the lawyers for the WP town coun­cil­lors and Ms How made was that al­low­ing AHTC to change its claims is se­verely prej­u­di­cial, be­cause they had run their case based on the orig­i­nal claims.</p>
    <p>This de­prives the de­fen­dants of the chance to fight the claims, since the trial is over.</p>
    <p>“The prej­u­dice suf­fered is ir­re­me­di­a­ble as the first to fifth de­fen­dants would have con­ducted their de­fence dif­fer­ently if th­ese claims had been made at the out­set,” said the lawyers of the WP town coun­cil­lors.</p>
    <p>They added that they would have ad­duced ad­di­tional ev­i­dence and also called other town coun­cil­lors to tes­tify on the is­sue of the man­ag­ing agent and es­sen­tial main­te­nance ser­vice unit con­tracts.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Ramesh, who heard the ap­pli­ca­tion to amend the state­ment of claim yes­ter­day, has re­served judg­ment.</p>
