    <p>Mi­crosoft’s new Sur­face Book 3 al­ready feels l ong in the tooth de­spite be­ing launched in Sin­ga­pore in June.</p>
    <p>This two-in-one con­vert­ible looks ex­actly like the orig­i­nal Sur­face Book from 2015, though it is pow­ered by the l at­est 10thgen­er­a­tion In­tel Core processor.</p>
    <p>What was in­no­va­tive then – such as the ful­crum hinge, which ex­tends when the lid is open to keep the top-heavy Sur­face Book 3 from tip­ping over – now feels in­creas­ingly like an anachro­nism.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause the PC in­dus­try seems to have moved away from the Sur­face Book’s de­tach­able 2-in-1 de­sign, where the screen de­taches from the key­board to be­come a tablet.</p>
    <p>A down­side of the ful­crum hinge is that the screen is not flush with the key­board when closed, which makes the Sur­face Book 3 sig­nif­i­cantly thicker than most note­books. The ful­crum hinge also pinches the thighs when you open the lid with the lap­top on your lap.</p>
    <p>You have to press a but­ton or tap on an on-screen icon to de­tach the screen from the key­board base. Be­cause the base con­tains the op­tional ded­i­cated graph­ics chip (a mid-range Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 in my re­view set), you are re­minded to prop­erly close any open apps us­ing this graph­ics chip be­fore de­tach­ing the screen.</p>
    <p>In short, this hinge de­sign has one too many dis­ad­van­tages, es­pe­cially when 2-in-1 con­vert­ibles that use a flex­i­ble 360-de­gree hinge are now as sleek as ul­tra­books.</p>
    <p>To be fair, the gap be­tween the screen and key­board en­ables Mi­crosoft to in­crease key travel for the Sur­face Book 3, which makes it more com­fort­able to type with than the shal­low key­boards of most ul­tra­books.</p>
    <p>The touch­pad re­mains one of the in­dus­try’s best. It is smooth, re­spon­sive and pro­duces a sat­is­fy­ing click when pressed. But Mi­crosoft has re­sisted the urge to fol­low the trend of in­creas­ingly large touch­pads.</p>
    <p>Also miss­ing is a Thun­der­bolt 3 port, which has higher band­width than USB-C to con­nect to mul­ti­ple sec­ondary 4K dis­plays and ex­ter­nal graph­ics cards. This is due to se­cu­rity con­cerns that the in­ter­face could be used to ac­cess the de­vice’s me­mory, ac­cord­ing to Mi­crosoft.</p>
    <p>As a tablet, the Sur­face Book 3 weighs around a handy 700g for its 13.5-inch screen size.</p>
    <p>It feels bal­anced in the hand, though the chas­sis be­comes fairly warm when run­ning in­ten­sive apps, de­spite hav­ing cool­ing vents run­ning along its edge.</p>
    <p>Adding to the dated feel of the de­vice are the chunky screen bezels. But the dis­play it­self is sharp and vi­brant. Like other Sur­face de­vices, the screen has a 3:2 as­pect ra­tio that is op­ti­mised for edit­ing doc­u­ments or surf­ing the In­ter­net.</p>
    <p>De­spite hav­ing the same Core i7 processor and twice the amount of me­mory as the Sur­face Pro 7, the Sur­face Book 3 ac­tu­ally falls be­hind in PCMark 10 with a score of just 4,084, com­pared with 4,233 for the Sur­face Pro.</p>
    <p>And while the Sur­face Book 3 has a mid-range GeForce GTX 1650 graph­ics chip, this chip comes pre­loaded with Nvidia’s Stu­dio driver, which is op­ti­mised for pro­fes­sional graph­ics ap­pli­ca­tions, un­like the gam­ing-cen­tric Nvidia Game Ready driver.</p>
    <p>Per­haps this is why the Sur­face Book did not per­form well in my gam­ing tests. While it achieves an av­er­age of 69 frames per sec­ond in Apex Leg­ends at 1,920 x 1,080 pix­els, there are se­vere dips in frame rates dur­ing the game’s hec­tic mo­ments, which af­fect my gam­ing per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>I am also dis­ap­pointed by the short bat­tery life of the Sur­face Book 3 when used as a tablet. With­out the key­board base, which has a sec­ond bat­tery, the Sur­face Book 3 lasts only two hours and 10 min­utes with the screen set to max­i­mum bright­ness.</p>
    <p>To be fair, the Sur­face Book 3 man­ages a very good eight hours, which is com­pa­ra­ble with the best ul­tra­books, when at­tached to its base and used as a lap­top.</p>
