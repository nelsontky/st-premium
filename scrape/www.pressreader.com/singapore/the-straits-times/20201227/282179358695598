    <p>MARYLYN TAN, 27 Poet</p>
    <p>Marylyn Tan made literary his­tory this year by be­com­ing the first woman to win the Sin­ga­pore Lit­er­a­ture Prize for English po­etry.</p>
    <p>She was also the first fe­male poet to score a solo win in the prize’s 28 years. Her ex­per­i­men­tal, sub­ver­sive de­but col­lec­tion, Gaze Back, was praised by the judges as “a clar­ion call for gen­der and lin­guis­tic recla­ma­tion”.</p>
    <p>This made Tan, who was one of the youngest short­listed for the prize this year, a pi­o­neer at the ten­der age of 27.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know that it’s changed my life,” she says of her win. “Maybe it just gives greater power to the point of the writ­ing – which is to make the world a safer, more eq­ui­table place, and to over­turn the dom­i­nant ide­olo­gies that per­pet­u­ate daily fear for dis­en­fran­chised mi­nori­ties.”</p>
    <p>Gaze Back, which was pub­lished by Ethos Books, takes its ti­tle from French fem­i­nist the­o­rist He­lene Cixous’ es­say The Laugh Of The Me­dusa, which refers to the Greek myth of the Gor­gon whose gaze turns men to stone.</p>
    <p>It pushes bound­aries, both in form and con­tent, and tack­les ta­boo top­ics such as men­stru­a­tion, fe­male sex­u­al­ity and witch­craft.</p>
    <p>It was also short­listed for the Lambda Literary Awards, a no­table United States-based prize for les­bian, gay, bi­sex­ual and trans­gen­der works.</p>
    <p>Tan’s win earns her a spot on this year’s Life Power List.</p>
    <p>“I am as­sum­ing it is a list of peo­ple with out­ra­geous amounts of life force surg­ing within their tiny bod­ies,” she quips. “Or maybe it’s about dis­man­tling op­pres­sive power struc­tures. Ei­ther way, I’m into it.”</p>
    <p>Be­fore her, the Sin­ga­pore Lit­er­a­ture Prize for po­etry had al­most en­tirely been won by men.</p>
    <p>Harti­nah Ah­mad won the prize for Malay po­etry in 2016 for an­thol­ogy Taf­siran Tiga Alam, which she co-au­thored with Hamed Is­mail and Sam­sudin Said.</p>
    <p>In 2014, Kr­ish­na­murthi Mathangi re­ceived a com­men­da­tion for Tamil po­etry for her col­lec­tion Malai­galin Parathal.</p>
    <p>Tan was taken aback by her vic­tory. She had writ­ten Gaze Back for a “very niche and marginalis­ed au­di­ence” and never ex­pected to get a nod from the estab­lish­ment.</p>
    <p>She works i n the reg­is­ter of shock and dis­com­fort.</p>
    <p>“At its core, dis­com­fort al­lows us to feel very vis­cer­ally what is wrong,” she says. “If you are un­com­fort­able with some­thing, that is more than an un­pleas­ant­ness – it is an op­por­tu­nity to ob­serve the ugly thing in its fullest ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>“I find dis­com­fort a great tool for em­pow­er­ment or even awak­en­ing. If you look at a piece of art and you find that it nau­se­ates you or it makes you feel itchy all over – it’s an ac­com­plish­ment in it­self. It’s a big deal for artists to be able to garner that kind of re­sponse to their work.”</p>
    <p>She stud­ied lin­guis­tics at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity (NTU) and now works as a con­tract cur­ricu­lum writer.</p>
    <p>Since her win, she has started an in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary artist col­lec­tive, Dis/Con­tent, which last month live-streamed a show­ing in col­lab­o­ra­tion with NTU Un­masked and will hold its first of­fi­cial show­case in Fe­bru­ary next year.</p>
    <p>“We have a mix of post­mod­ern po­etry, ritual, ob­ject-ori­ented on­tol­ogy and ex­per­i­men­tal lin­guis­tics, and are look­ing very much for­ward to see­ing how ev­ery­thing plays with it­self and each other,” she says.</p>
    <p>As for her­self, she re­solves to con­tinue to “kick down the door, to dis­rupt the sta­tus quo and to drink more wa­ter”.</p>
