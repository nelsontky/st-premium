    <p>•</p>
    <p>MOSCOW Moscow be­gan dis­tribut­ing the Sput­nik V Covid-19 vac­cine via 70 clin­ics yes­ter­day, mark­ing Rus­sia’s first mass vac­ci­na­tion against the dis­ease, the city’s coro­n­avirus task force said.</p>
    <p>The task force said the Rus­sian­made vac­cine would first be made avail­able to doc­tors and other med­i­cal work­ers, teach­ers and so­cial work­ers be­cause they ran the high­est risk of ex­po­sure to the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>“You are work­ing at an ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tion and have top pri­or­ity for the Covid-19 vac­cine, free of charge,” read a text mes­sage re­ceived by one Mus­covite, an el­e­men­tary school teacher, early yes­ter­day and seen by Reuters.</p>
    <p>Moscow, the epi­cen­tre of Rus­sia’s coro­n­avirus out­break, reg­is­tered 7,993 new cases overnight, up from 6,868 a day be­fore and well above the daily tal­lies of around 700 seen in early Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>“Over the first five hours, 5,000 peo­ple signed up for the jab – teach­ers, doc­tors, so­cial work­ers, those who are to­day risk­ing their health and lives the most,” Mayor Sergei Sobyanin wrote on his per­sonal web­site on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The age for those re­ceiv­ing shots is capped at 60. Peo­ple with cer­tain un­der­ly­ing health con­di­tions, preg­nant women and those who have had a res­pi­ra­tory ill­ness for the past two weeks are barred from vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia has de­vel­oped two Covid-19 vac­cines – Sput­nik V, which is backed by the Rus­sian Di­rect In­vest­ment Fund, and an­other de­vel­oped by Siberia’s Vec­tor In­sti­tute, with fi­nal tri­als for both yet to be com­pleted.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists have raised con­cerns about the speed at which Rus­sia has worked, giv­ing the reg­u­la­tory go-ahead for its vac­cines and launch­ing mass vac­ci­na­tions be­fore full tri­als to test its safety and ef­fi­cacy have been com­pleted.</p>
    <p>The Sput­nik V vac­cine is ad­min­is­tered in two in­jec­tions, with the se­cond dose ex­pected to be given 21 days af­ter the first.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Bahrain an­nounced it had ap­proved the emer­gency use of the Pfizer-BioNTech coro­n­avirus vac­cine, be­com­ing the se­cond coun­try af­ter Bri­tain to green­light the drug.</p>
    <p>“The ap­proval of the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine will add a fur­ther im­por­tant layer to the king­dom’s na­tional Covid-19 re­sponse,” said Na­tional Health Reg­u­la­tory Au­thor­ity chief ex­ec­u­tive Mariam alJalahma, ac­cord­ing to a state­ment car­ried by the of­fi­cial Bahrain News Agency on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Manama did not spec­ify when it would be­gin the vac­cine roll-out.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, Bri­tain said it ap­proved the Covid-19 vac­cine for gen­eral use.</p>
    <p>The first Pfizer-BioNTech vac­ci­na­tions in Eng­land are ex­pected to­mor­row, while Wales and North­ern Ire­land will be­gin on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>In the United States, com­pa­nies are gear­ing up for a mas­sive lo­gis­ti­cal ef­fort to aid vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>Car­maker Ford has or­dered its own freez­ers, while meat pro­cess­ing gi­ant Smith­field said it is ready to put the cold room at its abat­toirs at the dis­posal of vac­cine roll-out op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies spe­cial­is­ing in in­su­lat­ing con­tain­ers have been on a war foot­ing for weeks af­ter Pfizer and BioNTech said the vac­cine they had jointly de­vel­oped needs to be stored at mi­nus 70 deg C.</p>
    <p>US lo­gis­tics gi­ant UPS is al­ready pro­duc­ing 500kg of dry ice an hour in its de­pots and has de­vel­oped por­ta­ble freez­ers.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, US re­frig­er­a­tor man­u­fac­turer So-Low re­ported a “tremen­dous surge” in or­ders for its freez­ers that can main­tain tem­per­a­tures as low as mi­nus 84 deg C.</p>
    <p>GOOD RE­SPONSE</p>
    <p>Over the first five hours, 5,000 peo­ple signed up for the jab – teach­ers, doc­tors, so­cial work­ers, those who are to­day risk­ing their health and lives the most.</p>
    <p>MOSCOW MAYOR SERGEI SOBYANIN, on the re­sponse to the roll-out of the Sput­nik V Covid-19 vac­cine in the city.</p>
