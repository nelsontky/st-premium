    <p>HONG KONG • Lead­ing jockey Joao Moreira is seek­ing to repli­cate the hero­ics which saw him cap­ture two of last year’s four Group 1 Longines Hong Kong In­ter­na­tional Races at Sha Tin to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Last year, the for­mer four-time Sin­ga­pore cham­pion won the Hong Kong Sprint over 1,200m aboard Beat The Clock and the Hong Kong Vase over 2,400m on Glory Vase. He was sec­ond in the Hong Kong Mile over 1,600m on Waikuku, who will cross swords with his con­queror, Japan’s Ad­mire Mars, again.</p>
    <p>The Brazil­ian, dubbed the “Magic Man” for his wiz­ardry in the sad­dle, is look­ing for­ward to to­mor­row’s grand meet­ing, which sees keen par­tic­i­pa­tion from over­seas horses and jock­eys.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Group 1 Sin­ga­pore Guineas-Lion City Cup hero In­ferno was sup­posed to run in the HK$22 mil­lion (S$4 mil­lion) Hong Kong Sprint but was scratched on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>He was found to be lame in the left front leg.</p>
    <p>“It’s once a year only and, even more, it’s spe­cial now as we can’t travel for other in­ter­na­tional races (due to the Covid-19 pan­demic). So we, as jock­eys, have to make sure we do our job at home the best we can,” said Moreira, who has had a great sea­son with 51 wins, 20 clear of his near­est ri­val, reign­ing cham­pion Zac Pur­ton.</p>
    <p>He kicks off his first in­ter­na­tional ride on the Cas­par Fownes­trained Colum­bus County in the HK$20 mil­lion Hong Kong Vase.</p>
    <p>The tal­ented five-year-old was one of last sea­son’s lead­ing hopes for the Four-Year-Old Clas­sic Se­ries. This term, he has re­turned a solid Class 2 win first-up, be­fore step­ping up in grade to fin­ish third in the Group 2 Jockey Club Cup over 2,000m last start.</p>
    <p>“His run last time was quite im­pres­sive. He’s very likely to re­peat that and he’s ca­pa­ble of be­ing right there among the top three in the fin­ish. With a lit­tle bit of luck in the small field – you never know,” said Moreira.</p>
    <p>The jockey will rely on the John Size-trained Hot King Prawn, in the Hong Kong Sprint. The con­sis­tent grey lost nar­rowly to Beat The Clock last year.</p>
    <p>“He’s so con­sis­tent and he’s had a great prepa­ra­tion this term. He’s no doubt an­other horse that I am quite ex­cited about,” said Moreira.</p>
    <p>The 37-year-old will aim to go one bet­ter on the Size-trained Waikuku in the HK$25 mil­lion Hong Kong Mile.</p>
    <p>“The thing about him is that he likes to be fresh – his form shows that – and he’s go­ing to be fresh go­ing into the race. I have won on him first-up in the past – he likes to be that way,” said Moreira.</p>
    <p>The tal­ented miler won the Group 1 Stewards’ Cup over 1,600m in Jan­uary, beat­ing one of Hong Kong’s great­est horses, Beauty Gen­er­a­tion, by a neck.</p>
    <p>But, like most, Moreira thinks Hong Kong ris­ing cham­pion Golden Sixty, who has been beaten only once in 14 starts, is prob­a­bly the one to beat.</p>
    <p>“Win­ning is a dif­fer­ent story. Golden Sixty seems a star, so it might be a bit dif­fi­cult. But what­ever he does this time, we know next time, he’s go­ing to bring what he’s got best,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Tony Cruz-trained Furore com­pletes Moreira’s fi­nal Group 1 hope in the rich­est race on the pro­gramme – the HK$28 mil­lion Hong Kong Cup over 2,000m.</p>
    <p>The New Zealand-bred won the Group 3 Sa Sa Ladies’ Purse Hand­i­cap over 1,800m, be­fore over­haul­ing last sea­son’s Horse of The Year, Ex­ul­tant, in last month’s Group 2 Jockey Club Cup over 2,000m.</p>
    <p>“I think his chances are great. He did sur­prise me how he won last time. If he brings this form, he’s go­ing to be one of the horses to beat,” said Moreira.</p>
    <p>Be­sides seek­ing glory in the four In­ter­na­tional Races, he is also aim­ing at an­other mile­stone – his 1,000th Hong Kong win.</p>
    <p>He is only four wins away from be­com­ing just the third jockey in Hong Kong to record 1,000 wins. Only Dou­glas Whyte and Pur­ton have achieved the feat.</p>
    <p>With a full book of 10 rides, it is not out of reach, es­pe­cially for a man who has rid­den three or more win­ners in a sin­gle day 10 times al­ready this sea­son.</p>
    <p>It would be a phe­nom­e­nal achieve­ment, es­pe­cially with only eight sea­sons un­der his belt.</p>
