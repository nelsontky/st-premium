    <p>NEW YORK • Kim Clijsters will re­turn to Flush­ing Mead­ows this week look­ing to rekin­dle the magic that saw her emerge from her first re­tire­ment in 2009 to win the US Open, but ques­tions about her readi­ness and a tough draw do not bode well for her chances.</p>
    <p>The Bel­gian, 37, re­tired a sec­ond time in 2012 but came back again this year seek­ing to add to her tro­phy col­lec­tion of four Grand Slams, in­clud­ing three US Open ti­tles.</p>
    <p>The good news for the former world No. 1 is that she will be play­ing on her pre­ferred hard-court sur­face, which re­wards her ag­gres­sive style of play.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, Clijsters has suf­fered first-round ex­its in Dubai and Mon­ter­rey and, de­spite im­pres­sive wins as part of the New York Em­pire in World TeamTen­nis, she with­drew ahead of last week’s Western & South­ern Open with an ab­dom­i­nal in­jury.</p>
    <p>The US Open wild­card will also face a stiff chal­lenge in Rus­sia’s 21st seed Eka­te­rina Alexan­drova in the first round to­day.</p>
    <p>“Her first come­back was extraordin­ary when she won as a mum,” former US Open fi­nal­ist and now ESPN broad­caster Pam Shriver said.</p>
    <p>“This is a much tougher sit­u­a­tion be­cause late 30s is a lot dif­fer­ent,” she added of Clijsters, a mother of three.</p>
    <p>A fac­tor that could work in the Bel­gian’s favour is the un­prece­dented na­ture of this year’s Grand Slam.</p>
    <p>It will be held with­out fans due to the Covid-19 pan­demic and re­quire com­peti­tors to stay in a bio-se­cure bub­ble, some­thing that may re­ward more ex­pe­ri­enced play­ers.</p>
    <p>How­ever, her match readi­ness re­mains a big ques­tion.</p>
    <p>“If she’s healthy and has re­ally been able to train and put in the hours in the last 10 days to get her­self to 100 per cent, she can still play at a pretty high level,” Shriver said.</p>
    <p>But, given her lack of matches in the lead-up to the US Open, Clijsters might have a bet­ter shot at mak­ing a run in Jan­uary’s Aus­tralian Open, Shriver added.</p>
    <p>“I just feel like it’s too early for the US Open to bode well,” she said.</p>
    <p>“It would be a tremen­dous story if it does and I would be happy if I’m wrong.</p>
    <p>“Kim is one of the most pop­u­lar cham­pi­ons ever, so any suc­cess she has around ev­ery cor­ner would be a happy mo­ment.”</p>
