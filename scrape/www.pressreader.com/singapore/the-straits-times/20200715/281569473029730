    <p>The econ­omy took a far big­ger hit than ex­pected in the sec­ond quar­ter as the cir­cuit breaker took its toll and sent the coun­try into its first tech­ni­cal re­ces­sion in 11 years.</p>
    <p>Gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) dived 12.6 per cent com­pared with the same pe­riod last year – markedly more than the 10.5 per cent drop economists tipped in a Bloomberg poll.</p>
    <p>It is also much worse than in the first quar­ter, when GDP fell by a re­vised 0.3 per cent, mark­ing the first time growth had turned neg­a­tive in a decade.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try (MTI) said yes­ter­day that the sharp fall in GDP was due to the cir­cuit breaker mea­sures that were im­ple­mented from April 7 to June 1 as well as weak ex­ter­nal de­mand amid a global eco­nomic down­turn.</p>
    <p>The quar­ter-on-quar­ter es­ti­mates are es­pe­cially stark, show­ing that the econ­omy shrank a record 41.2 per cent from the first quar­ter to the sec­ond, sig­nalling a tech­ni­cal re­ces­sion for the first time since 2009.</p>
    <p>A tech­ni­cal re­ces­sion refers to two straight quar­ters of quar­teron-quar­ter con­trac­tion.</p>
    <p>Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said yes­ter­day that the num­bers show the ex­tent of the chal­lenges fac­ing Sin­ga­pore amid the pan­demic and the ef­fort re­quired to re­store the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“The road to re­cov­ery in the months ahead will be chal­leng­ing,” he added in a Face­book post.</p>
    <p>“We ex­pect re­cov­ery to be a slow and un­even jour­ney, as ex­ter­nal de­mand con­tin­ues to be weak and coun­tries bat­tle the sec­ond and third waves of out­breaks by re­in­stat­ing lo­calised lock­downs or stricter safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.”</p>
    <p>The pace of re­cov­ery will also de­pend on how well Sin­ga­pore keeps com­mu­nity in­fec­tions low, noted Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Trades Union Congress as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Pa­trick Tay said in a sep­a­rate Face­book post that the num­bers “paint a som­bre and wor­ry­ing out­look for the Sin­ga­pore econ­omy for the rest of 2020”.</p>
    <p>We ex­pect re­cov­ery to be a slow and un­even jour­ney, as ex­ter­nal de­mand con­tin­ues to be weak and coun­tries bat­tle the sec­ond and third waves of out­breaks by re­in­stat­ing lo­calised lock­downs or stricter safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay said he ex­pects “a sharp spike in re­trench­ments and unemployme­nt fig­ures as well”, ahead of sec­ond-quar­ter labour mar­ket data due at the end of this month.</p>
    <p>The MTI fore­cast in May that the econ­omy could con­tract by be­tween 4 per cent and 7 per cent for the full year, which would make it Sin­ga­pore’s worst re­ces­sion since in­de­pen­dence in 1965.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond-quar­ter slump was led by the con­struc­tion sec­tor, which plunged 54.7 per cent year on year, a sig­nif­i­cant de­te­ri­o­ra­tion from the 1.1 per cent de­cline in the first quar­ter.</p>
    <p>“Con­struc­tion out­put weak­ened on ac­count of the cir­cuit breaker mea­sures, which led to a stop­page of most ac­tiv­i­ties dur­ing the pe­riod, as well as man­power dis­rup­tions... to curb Covid-19, in­clud­ing move­ment re­stric­tions at for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries,” the MTI said.</p>
    <p>On a quar­ter-on-quar­ter ba­sis, con­struc­tion shrank 95.6 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter, far worse than the 12.2 per cent con­trac­tion in the first three months.</p>
    <p>Ser­vice in­dus­tries fell 13.6 per cent year on year in the sec­ond quar­ter, steeper than the 2.4 per cent de­cline in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>The only bright spot was man­u­fac­tur­ing, which grew 2.5 per cent year on year in the three months to June 30, but this lagged be­hind the 8.2 per cent pace of the first quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Man­u­fac­tur­ing growth in the sec­ond quar­ter was pri­mar­ily aided by a surge in bio­med­i­cal out­put.</p>
    <p>Still, weak ex­ter­nal de­mand and work­place dis­rup­tions dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod weighed on pro­duc­tion in the chem­i­cals, trans­port engi­neer­ing and gen­eral man­u­fac­tur­ing clus­ters, the MTI said.</p>
    <p>SLOW RE­COV­ERY AHEAD</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>TRADE AND IN­DUS­TRY MIN­IS­TER CHAN CHUN SING</p>
    <p>The dou­ble-digit de­cline in sec­ondquar­ter eco­nomic growth could mark the be­gin­ning of the end for Sin­ga­pore’s worst re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts be­lieve the econ­omy may have al­ready hit rock bot­tom and is now on the path to re­cov­ery, but the depth of the de­cline means growth will re­main in neg­a­tive ter­ri­tory through the year.</p>
    <p>Ad­vance es­ti­mates from the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try yes­ter­day showed that the econ­omy shrank 12.6 per cent year on year in the sec­ond quar­ter as cir­cuit breaker mea­sures at home and lock­downs abroad crimped growth.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the ad­vance es­ti­mates were largely based on data from April and May, co­in­cid­ing with the two-month cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>The ab­sence of data from last month, when Sin­ga­pore started to re­lax re­stric­tions may have dis­torted the es­ti­mate, said an­a­lysts, who ex­pect the sec­ond-quar­ter es­ti­mate to be re­vised higher next month to re­flect the im­pact of the re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>“The worst is likely over,” said Ms Se­lena Ling, head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy at OCBC Bank.</p>
    <p>She said that with the econ­omy shrink­ing 6.5 per cent year on year in the first six months, some sta­bil­i­sa­tion may start to emerge with smaller con­trac­tions in sub­se­quent quar­ters. How­ever, Mr Irvin Seah, se­nior econ­o­mist at DBS Bank, said that the turn of the tide may not lift all boats at the same time.</p>
    <p>“The pace of re­cov­ery in the con­struc­tion and some ser­vice sec­tors will be com­par­a­tively slower.”</p>
    <p>Sec­tors like ac­com­mo­da­tion and air trans­port were se­verely af­fected by global and do­mes­tic travel curbs, which brought vis­i­tor ar­rivals and air travel to a stand­still, so tourism and avi­a­tion could po­ten­tially take more than two years to re­cover to pre-Covid-19 lev­els, Mr Seah said.</p>
    <p>“Even as pol­i­cy­mak­ers try to es­tab­lish travel bub­ble and green lanes, aim­ing to re­vive cross-bor­der travel, short of an ef­fec­tive vac­cine, the process is ex­pected to be painfully slow due to the per­sis­tent spread of the virus across the world,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Seah also noted that the phased re­open­ing of the econ­omy should boost pri­vate con­sump­tion that had col­lapsed amid the cir­cuit break pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The un­prece­dented fis­cal mea­sures, in the form of four stim­u­lus pack­ages, would also start to show up in gross do­mes­tic prod­uct growth from the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>In fact, some of the Bud­get mea­sures tar­get­ing jobs may po­ten­tially be ex­tended if the do­mes­tic labour mar­ket con­tin­ues to soften fur­ther, Mr Seah said.</p>
