    <p>Covid-19 has re­minded coun­tries of the need for more co­or­di­na­tion. If the mul­ti­lat­eral ef­fort to vac­ci­nate the world and enable eco­nomic re­cov­ery suc­ceeds, one hopes this will also pro­vide the im­pe­tus for con­tin­ued co­op­er­a­tion to tackle other global prob­lems such as the cli­mate chal­lenge, says Sin­ga­pore edi­tor Zakir Hus­sain.</p>
    <p>The an­nual cy­cle of re­gional and global sum­mits that tra­di­tion­ally takes place ev­ery Novem­ber sees a flurry of air travel on the part of lead­ers and their of­fi­cials, and is an in­di­ca­tor of some of their press­ing con­cerns – from trade deals to skills devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Last year, Asean lead­ers and their key part­ners meet­ing in Bangkok re­solved to press on to con­clude a re­gion-wide trade pact even as India dropped a bomb­shell by say­ing that it was pulling out of the deal.</p>
    <p>Then, of­fi­cials’ plans to make it to San­ti­ago for the Asia-Pa­cific Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion (Apec) sum­mit and the United Na­tions Cli­mate Change Con­fer­ence, or COP 25, were scup­pered as mass protests crip­pled Chile’s cap­i­tal and forced these sched­uled meet­ings to be aborted.</p>
    <p>This year, as the coro­n­avirus ground air travel to a near halt, face-to-face diplo­macy has had to take a back­seat.</p>
    <p>Yet the pan­demic has led to some pos­i­tive out­comes.</p>
    <p>It has pushed coun­tries ne­go­ti­at­ing the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship past the fin­ish line, as they signed the agree­ment one-by-one, vir­tu­ally, at a sum­mit hosted by Viet­nam on Nov 15. This brings about the for­ma­tion of the world’s largest free trade area.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral days later, on Nov 20, Apec lead­ers reached agree­ment on a joint dec­la­ra­tion – their first in three years, as their 2018 sum­mit failed to reach con­sen­sus be­cause of US-China trade ten­sion.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 ap­pears to have given coun­tries a hard re­al­ity check; not just on the need to re­main open and work to­wards low­er­ing bar­ri­ers to trade, but also as a re­minder of the need for mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism, and for stepped-up co­or­di­na­tion and co­op­er­a­tion – from en­sur­ing suf­fi­cient es­sen­tial med­i­cal sup­plies and shar­ing in­for­ma­tion on dis­eases to de­vel­op­ing and dis­tribut­ing vac­cines.</p>
    <p>This is cru­cial.</p>
    <p>As the Apec lead­ers noted in the Kuala Lumpur dec­la­ra­tion is­sued min­utes after their vir­tual meet­ing ended a week ago: “Our co­or­di­nated ac­tion and co­op­er­a­tion are more im­por­tant than ever to over­come the chal­lenges of Covid-19 and re­alise new and emerg­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for pros­per­ity for all.”</p>
    <p>They also ac­knowl­edged that sci­ence, tech­nol­ogy and in­no­va­tion are im­por­tant to the re­gion’s post-Covid-19 re­cov­ery, say­ing: “We reaf­firm the need to co­op­er­ate con­struc­tively on Covid-19 in­clud­ing the re­search and devel­op­ment, pro­duc­tion, manufactur­ing and dis­tri­bu­tion of di­ag­nos­tic tests, es­sen­tial med­i­cal prod­ucts and ser­vices, ther­a­peu­tics and vac­cines.”</p>
    <p>The lead­ers added: “We high­light the im­por­tance of fa­cil­i­tat­ing eq­ui­table ac­cess to safe, qual­ity, ef­fec­tive and af­ford­able vac­cines and other med­i­cal coun­ter­mea­sures that are vi­tal to safe­guard peo­ple’s health and well-be­ing, while in­cen­tivis­ing in­no­va­tion. We ac­knowl­edge that the role of ex­ten­sive im­mu­ni­sa­tion against Covid-19 is crit­i­cal in or­der to bring the pan­demic to an end.”</p>
    <p>Vac­cine mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism</p>
    <p>The rapid global spread of</p>
    <p>Covid-19 – with over 61 mil­lion cases and more than 1.4 mil­lion deaths to date – un­der­scores the im­por­tance of the widely re­peated say­ing: “No one is safe un­til ev­ery­one is safe.”</p>
    <p>As coun­tries be­gan lock­ing down bor­ders ear­lier this year, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO), var­i­ous gov­ern­ments and a num­ber of or­gan­i­sa­tions joined forces to ac­cel­er­ate the devel­op­ment of tests and vac­cines.</p>
    <p>One sig­nif­i­cant out­come has been the Covid-19 Vac­cine Global Ac­cess (Co­vax) fa­cil­ity, which works to sup­port the re­search, devel­op­ment and manufactur­ing of a wide range of vac­cine can­di­dates, and ne­go­ti­ate their pric­ing.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has backed this ef­fort, co-found­ing with Switzer­land a Friends of the Co­vax Fa­cil­ity group that brings to­gether a num­ber of like-minded coun­tries to un­der­line the im­por­tance of vac­cine mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism.</p>
    <p>The con­cept be­hind Co­vax – started by Gavi, the Vac­cine Al­liance, a foun­da­tion that be­gan 20 years ago to im­prove ac­cess to vac­ci­na­tion for chil­dren liv­ing in the world’s poor­est coun­tries; the Coali­tion for Epi­demic Pre­pared­ness, which was launched in 2017 by the gov­ern­ments of Nor­way and India as well as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foun­da­tion; and the WHO – is that coun­tries pool funds to in­vest in strong vac­cine can­di­dates, help­ing man­u­fac­tur­ers scale up promis­ing ones, and en­sur­ing that par­tic­i­pat­ing coun­tries get equal ac­cess to vac­cines once these are de­vel­oped.</p>
    <p>The ini­tial aim is to scale this up to two bil­lion doses – a fig­ure slightly over 25 per cent of the world’s pop­u­la­tion – of safe, ef­fec­tive vac­cines that have passed reg­u­la­tory ap­proval, WHO pre-qual­i­fi­ca­tion, or both, by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>If achieved, this should be enough to pro­tect high-risk and vul­ner­a­ble per­sons, in­clud­ing front-line health­care work­ers.</p>
    <p>Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, ex­plains: “We don’t just need Covid-19 vac­cines, we also need to en­sure that ev­ery­one in the world has ac­cess to them.”</p>
    <p>Oth­er­wise, “there is a very real risk that the ma­jor­ity of peo­ple in the world will go un­pro­tected against Sars-CoV-2, and this would al­low the virus and its im­pact to con­tinue un­abated”.</p>
    <p>There is also the con­cern that larger and bet­ter-off coun­tries would strike ar­range­ments with man­u­fac­tur­ers to mo­nop­o­lise a lion’s share of vac­cines as they be­come avail­able.</p>
    <p>Un­der Co­vax, once any of the vac­cines in its port­fo­lio have suc­cess­fully un­der­gone clin­i­cal tri­als and proved them­selves to be both safe and ef­fec­tive, and have re­ceived reg­u­la­tory ap­proval, avail­able doses will be al­lo­cated to all par­tic­i­pat­ing coun­tries at the same rate, pro­por­tional to their to­tal pop­u­la­tion size.</p>
    <p>A small buf­fer of about 5 per cent of the avail­able doses will be kept aside for a stock­pile to help with acute out­breaks and to sup­port hu­man­i­tar­ian groups, for ex­am­ple, those help­ing refugees who may not oth­er­wise have ac­cess to a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>An ad­vance mar­ket com­mit­ment also helps en­sure that 92 middle- and lower-in­come coun­tries which can­not af­ford to fund the vac­cines them­selves will get equal ac­cess to the vac­cines as the 97 higher-in­come economies that can pay their way – and get them at vir­tu­ally the same time.</p>
    <p>Dr Berkley noted that the vast ma­jor­ity of vac­cines un­der­go­ing devel­op­ment are likely to fail.</p>
    <p>Based on pre­vi­ous vac­cines, those at the pre-clin­i­cal trial stage have a roughly 7 per cent chance of suc­ceed­ing, while the ones that make it to clin­i­cal tri­als have about a 20 per cent chance.</p>
    <p>Co­vax has nine can­di­date vac­cines in devel­op­ment, with a fur­ther nine un­der eval­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>There are now more than 180 coun­tries that have signed on to the Co­vax fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>The United States, which has with­drawn from the WHO, is not one of them, hav­ing de­cided to strike its own deals with vac­cine de­vel­op­ers. Amer­ica’s Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed has set the goal of de­liv­er­ing 300 mil­lion doses starting next Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>The en­vi­ron­ment mat­ters too</p>
    <p>Jan­uary is also the month that Amer­ica’s next pres­i­dent takes of­fice. And while few ex­pect</p>
    <p>Mr Joe Bi­den to change course en­tirely, there are hopes that he will sig­nal greater sup­port for mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has pledged to re­verse Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s de­ci­sions to with­draw from the WHO as well as the Paris Agree­ment on cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has de­ferred the next ma­jor UN cli­mate gath­er­ing, COP 26, to next Novem­ber, to be held in Glas­gow. But it has also seen gov­ern­ments pay greater at­ten­tion to the en­vi­ron­ment and sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>The sharp drop in air travel has led to a re­duc­tion in emis­sions this year, and the dis­rup­tion in sup­ply chains forced many to re­visit the is­sue of re­silience.</p>
    <p>It will likely be some time be­fore we see a re­sump­tion of global, let alone re­gional, travel to 2019 lev­els, and be­fore so­ci­eties can dial back on mea­sures such as safe distancing and mask wear­ing.</p>
    <p>But when we do, we should not re­turn to old pat­terns of op­er­at­ing that may have framed the is­sue as one of ef­fi­ciency over health, or eco­nom­ics over the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>These are in­ter­linked con­sid­er­a­tions that have to be care­fully bal­anced, rather than be com­pet­ing pri­or­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Apec’s pol­icy sup­port group drew at­ten­tion to this cal­i­bra­tion that had to be struck in its re­port this month.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 has mer­ci­lessly ex­ploited old chal­lenges of en­vi­ron­men­tal dam­age and grow­ing in­equal­ity that have not been ad­e­quately ad­dressed. En­vi­ron­men­tal dam­age through de­for­esta­tion, log­ging and min­ing in­creases our ex­po­sure to dis­eases by in­creas­ing hu­man-to-an­i­mal con­tact. In­fec­tious dis­eases with zoonotic ori­gins, such as Covid-19, are a side ef­fect of un­sus­tain­able prac­tices. The fre­quency and sever­ity of dis­eases are also af­fected by changes in cli­mate pat­terns, with ris­ing tem­per­a­tures pro­vid­ing ideal con­di­tions for the spread of pathogens and dis­ease vec­tors,” it said.</p>
    <p>Re­gional co­op­er­a­tion and col­lab­o­ra­tion will have a key role to play in the process of re­build­ing and re­cov­ery, the re­port added.</p>
    <p>“In a year like no other, the re­gion has been com­pelled to re­think how it works, how it learns, and what it pri­ori­tises. The re­gion needs to in­vest in green jobs and in­fra­struc­ture, shift away from a fos­sil fuel econ­omy, and in­ter­nalise en­vi­ron­men­tal and cli­mate im­pact into eco­nomic pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>“It needs to en­sure eq­ui­table ac­cess to health­care, in­fra­struc­ture, tech­nol­ogy, and ed­u­ca­tion and skills devel­op­ment to enable all peo­ple to con­trib­ute to and ben­e­fit from eco­nomic op­por­tu­ni­ties. It needs to max­imise the po­ten­tial of the dig­i­tal econ­omy through in­no­va­tion and com­pe­ti­tion, but at the same time ad­dress po­ten­tial ad­verse im­pact on jobs and in­comes in the pur­suit of an equal and in­clu­sive so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>In­vest­ing in what is key, en­abling in­no­va­tion and com­pe­ti­tion and en­sur­ing equal and in­clu­sive ac­cess to ben­e­fits – these are also crit­i­cal el­e­ments of the mul­ti­lat­eral ef­fort to vac­ci­nate the world against Covid-19 and enable economies to re­build and re­cover from their worst cri­sis in decades.</p>
    <p>If the ef­fort suc­ceeds, as many are bank­ing on it to, one hopes this will also pro­vide the im­pe­tus for con­tin­ued co­op­er­a­tion to tackle other global prob­lems, in­clud­ing the cli­mate chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>An ad­vance mar­ket com­mit­ment also helps en­sure that 92 mid­dle­and lower-in­come coun­tries which can­not af­ford to fund the vac­cines them­selves will get equal ac­cess to the vac­cines as the 97 higher-in­come economies that can pay their way – and get them at vir­tu­ally the same time.</p>
