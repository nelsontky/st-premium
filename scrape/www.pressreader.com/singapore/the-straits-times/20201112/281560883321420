    <p>Bri­tish com­pa­nies cited three big ob­sta­cles to hir­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent residents, in a re­cent sur­vey by the Bri­tish Cham­ber of Com­merce. Half of the busi­nesses polled cited tech­ni­cal skills as the big­gest ob­sta­cle, fol­lowed by salary ex­pec­ta­tions and the avail­abil­ity of advanced soft skills.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish com­pa­nies cited three big ob­sta­cles to hir­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent residents (PRs), in a re­cent sur­vey by the Bri­tish Cham­ber of Com­merce (BritCham).</p>
    <p>Half of the busi­nesses polled in the in­au­gu­ral man­power sur­vey re­leased yes­ter­day cited tech­ni­cal skills as the big­gest ob­sta­cle.</p>
    <p>This was fol­lowed by salary ex­pec­ta­tions (38 per cent) and the avail­abil­ity of advanced soft skills (35 per cent).</p>
    <p>About a quar­ter, or 26 per cent, of re­spon­dents said se­nior man­age­ment roles were the most dif­fi­cult po­si­tions to fill with Sin­ga­porean and PR can­di­dates in the past 12 months.</p>
    <p>Other roles cited as the most dif­fi­cult to fill with lo­cal man­power in­cluded po­si­tions in busi­ness de­vel­op­ment (17 per cent), fol­lowed by po­si­tions in IT as well as mar­ket­ing and com­mu­ni­ca­tions (12 per cent).</p>
    <p>The sur­vey on hir­ing prac­tices polled 79 Bri­tish com­pa­nies from in­dus­tries such as ed­u­ca­tion and train­ing, pro­fes­sional ser­vices, fin­tech and con­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>It was con­ducted be­tween Nov 4 and Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans and PRs com­prised 66 per cent of the Sin­ga­pore-based work­force on av­er­age in the com­pa­nies polled in the BritCham sur­vey.</p>
    <p>De­spite the Covid-19 out­break, the ma­jor­ity of busi­nesses in the poll said they were ei­ther ac­tively re­cruit­ing (37 per cent) or ex­pected to hire staff in the next six months (36 per cent). The re­main­ing 27 per cent said they had no plans for re­cruit­ment in the next six months.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, one in five com­pa­nies polled said it had laid off work­ers in Sin­ga­pore due to the out­break.</p>
    <p>Of those that did, about 8 per cent of their pre-Covid-19 work­force in Sin­ga­pore were laid off on av­er­age.</p>
    <p>This in­creased to 21 per cent when it came to re­dun­dan­cies at the re­gional level.</p>
    <p>At the global level, re­dun­dan­cies came to 9 per cent on av­er­age.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey also looked at the chal­lenges that Bri­tish com­pa­nies faced when hir­ing in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>When asked whether Sin­ga­pore uni­ver­si­ties ad­e­quately pre­pare fresh grad­u­ates for “re­al­is­tic en­try-level roles” within multi­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions, nearly half of the re­spon­dents some­what agreed (43 per cent) with the state­ment and 3 per cent strongly agreed.</p>
    <p>More than one-fifth, or 22 per cent, ei­ther strongly dis­agreed or some­what dis­agreed with the state­ment.</p>
    <p>When ap­plied to small and medium-sized or­gan­i­sa­tions, 29 per cent of re­spon­dents ei­ther strongly dis­agreed or some­what dis­agreed with the state­ment, 3 per cent strongly agreed and 40 per cent some­what agreed.</p>
    <p>BritCham ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor David Kelly said in a state­ment yes­ter­day that the cham­ber will con­tinue to sup­port its nearly 9,000 mem­bers with their man­power re­quire­ments and the pro­fes­sional de­vel­op­ment of their staff, by col­lab­o­rat­ing with the Min­istry of Man­power and Work­force Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>He added that BritCham will con­tinue to gather feed­back and busi­ness updates from its net­work, “to sup­port the needs of busi­nesses and to aid the min­istry with its strat­egy and plan­ning go­ing for­ward, par­tic­u­larly as Sin­ga­pore looks to re­cover and grow be­yond the pan­demic”.</p>
