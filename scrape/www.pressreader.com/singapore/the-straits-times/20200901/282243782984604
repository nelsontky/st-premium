    <p>Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day elected Mr Christo­pher de Souza (Hol­landBukit Timah GRC) and Ms Jes­sica Tan (East Coast GRC) as Deputy Speak­ers of Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>They will re­place Mr Charles Chong, who has re­tired from pol­i­tics, and Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mount­bat­ten).</p>
    <p>Mr Chong had held the post for two terms, since 2011, while Mr Lim had served in the role for one term, since 2016.</p>
    <p>As Deputy Speak­ers, Mr de Souza and Ms Tan will take over the re­spon­si­bil­i­ties of Speaker Tan Chuan-Jin when he is not around.</p>
    <p>Th­ese du­ties in­clude pre­sid­ing over par­lia­men­tary pro­ceed­ings and reg­u­lat­ing the time al­lot­ted to var­i­ous MPs dur­ing de­bates.</p>
    <p>The mo­tion to elect the two fourth-term MPs as Deputy Speak­ers was moved by Deputy Leader of the House Zaqy Mo­hamad, who re­ferred to them as highly ex­pe­ri­enced par­lia­men­tar­i­ans and model pro­fes­sion­als with a strong sense of fair­ness and ob­jec­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>In 2014, Mr de Souza in­tro­duced a Pri­vate Mem­ber’s Bill – a pro­posed law put forth by an MP who is not a min­is­ter – on pre­vent­ing hu­man traf­fick­ing which was later passed by Par­lia­ment, said Mr Zaqy. He added that Mr de Souza had also served as chair­man of the Govern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee (GPC) for Home Af­fairs and Law from 2015 to this year.</p>
    <p>And Ms Tan “comes with ex­ten­sive cor­po­rate ex­pe­ri­ence in se­nior lead­er­ship roles with in­ter­na­tional firms”, said Mr Zaqy. He added that she had served as chair­man of the Pub­lic Ac­counts Com­mit­tee from 2016 to this year, and as chair­man of the GPC for Fi­nance, Trade and In­dus­try from 2010 to 2015.</p>
    <p>“I am con­fi­dent that both Mr Christo­pher de Souza and Ms Jes­sica Tan, with their ex­per­tise, ex­pe­ri­ence and char­ac­ter, will make good deputies in dis­charg­ing their du­ties and sup­port Mr Speaker in the course of this 14th Par­lia­ment ses­sion,” Mr Zaqy said.</p>
