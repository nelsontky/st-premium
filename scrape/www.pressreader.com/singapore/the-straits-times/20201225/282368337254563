    <p>NEW YORK • In an im­me­di­ate blow to the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion’s (NBA) at­tempt to stage a sea­son with­out the pro­tec­tion of a re­stricted-ac­cess bub­ble, league of­fi­cials were forced to post­pone Hous­ton’s sea­son opener on Wed­nes­day against Ok­la­homa City Thun­der when the Rock­ets were un­able to field the re­quired min­i­mum of eight play­ers in uni­form.</p>
    <p>On just the se­cond night of the 2020-21 sea­son, an an­nounce­ment that the game would be post­poned “in ac­cor­dance with the league’s health and safety pro­to­cols” came less than three hours be­fore the game’s tip-off in Hous­ton.</p>
    <p>Three Rock­ets play­ers, ac­cord­ing to the league, had coro­n­avirus tests that were ei­ther pos­i­tive or in­con­clu­sive, lead­ing to the place­ment of four other Rock­ets play­ers in quar­an­tine af­ter con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, Chris Cle­mons is in­jured, and All-Star James Har­den was pre­vented from play­ing be­cause of what the league termed “a vi­o­la­tion” of its health and safety guide­lines. The league later fined Har­den US$50,000 (S$66,500) for at­tend­ing “a pri­vate in­door party” on Mon­day; a video cir­cu­lat­ing this week showed him at an in­door venue with­out a mask.</p>
    <p>The Rock­ets were one of six teams in the 30-team NBA sched­uled to al­low re­duced-ca­pac­ity crowds into their build­ings at the start of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>Com­mis­sioner Adam Sil­ver said in a se­ries of in­ter­views on Mon­day that the NBA was an­tic­i­pat­ing “bumps in the road along the way”, but be­ing forced to or­der a post­pone­ment so soon il­lu­mi­nated the var­i­ous com­pli­ca­tions it faces.</p>
    <p>The NBA is try­ing to oper­ate a con­tact sport played en­tirely in­doors with mere 17-player ros­ters and fre­quent travel amid an un­yield­ing pan­demic.</p>
    <p>No de­ci­sion has been made about the Rock­ets’ next game to­mor­row night at Port­land.</p>
    <p>Har­den, who for weeks has been push­ing be­hind the scenes for a trade, con­firmed ear­lier on Wed­nes­day in a since-deleted In­sta­gram post that he re­cently at­tended an “event” to sup­port a friend.</p>
    <p>The league’s nearly 160 pages of health and safety guide­lines pro­hibit play­ers from go­ing to bars, lounges or clubs this sea­son, as well as from us­ing pub­lic trans­porta­tion and from at­tend­ing in­door gath­er­ings of more than 15 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Hous­ton’s sud­den short­age of play­ers on Wed­nes­day, how­ever, stemmed largely from coro­n­avirus con­cerns sep­a­rate from those sur­round­ing Har­den.</p>
    <p>ESPN re­ported that vet­er­ans John Wall and De­Mar­cus Cousins and rookie Kenyon Martin Jr had gath­ered at an apart­ment away from the team’s fa­cil­i­ties for hair­cuts. Wall and Cousins tested neg­a­tive for the coro­n­avirus, ESPN said, but Hous­ton did not have eight play­ers avail­able for what was to be the team’s first game with Stephen Si­las as their head coach.</p>
    <p>Sil­ver also said on Tues­day that with teams play­ing in their home are­nas he “wouldn’t be sur­prised” to see post­pone­ments re­lated to Covid-19. That was why the league re­leased a sched­ule only for the first half of the sea­son, with the se­cond half slate to be filled in later.</p>
    <p>“When you’re play­ing out­side a bub­ble it’s al­most im­pos­si­ble to avoid this virus,” he added.</p>
    <p>The league re­ported zero Covid-19 cases af­ter three months and 172 games in its Dis­ney World “bub­ble” in Or­lando, Florida last sea­son.</p>

He had at&#xAD;tended a pri&#xAD;vate in&#xAD;door party on Mon&#xAD;day and was later fined US$50,000 by the league.</p>
