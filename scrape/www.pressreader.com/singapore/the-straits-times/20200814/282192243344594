    <p>MOSCOW • Rus­sia’s ath­let­ics fed­er­a­tion (Rusaf) on Wed­nes­day said it had paid a dop­ing fine with help from the coun­try’s sports min­istry to avoid ex­pul­sion from track and field’s global gov­ern­ing body.</p>
    <p>Last month, World Ath­let­ics said the fed­er­a­tion would be ex­pelled if it failed to pay US$6.3 mil­lion (S$8.6 mil­lion), a sum that in­cludes a fine for breach­ing anti-dop­ing rules, be­fore Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The Rus­sian sports min­istry said ear­lier on Wed­nes­day it had “made an un­prece­dented de­ci­sion” to give Rusaf a “one-time sub­sidy to de­velop the sport, in­clud­ing to pay off a debt to World Ath­let­ics”.</p>
    <p>It would also “con­tinue to ren­der sup­port and as­sis­tance in the im­ple­men­ta­tion of a plan to en­force a zero-tol­er­ance at­ti­tude to­wards dop­ing and re­in­stat­ing Rusaf mem­ber­ship in World Ath­let­ics”.</p>
    <p>An ex­pul­sion would have meant Rus­sian ath­letes would be side­lined from in­ter­na­tional com­pe­ti­tions in­clud­ing the de­layed Tokyo Games, which are sched­uled to start on July 23 next year.</p>
    <p>It would also have ex­cluded those who had pre­vi­ously been au­tho­rised to com­pete as neu­trals.</p>
    <p>The US$6.3 mil­lion pay­ment was the re­main­ing part of a US$10 mil­lion fine that Rusaf paid off only par­tially by July 1.</p>
    <p>Rusaf has been sus­pended since 2015, and its ath­letes were barred from the 2016 Rio Olympics, with the far­ci­cal sit­u­a­tion heav­ily crit­i­cised by Rus­sia’s top ath­letes, in­clud­ing three-time world high jump cham­pion Maria La­sitskene.</p>
    <p>While the fine has been set­tled, World Ath­let­ics is still de­mand­ing the body set out a de­tailed plan for its re­in­state­ment by Aug 31, in­clud­ing com­mit­ments to anti-dop­ing and gov­er­nance re­forms.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Rusaf re­vealed the plan was be­ing de­vel­oped with the in­volve­ment of Rus­sia’s Olympic Com­mit­tee and Rus­sia’s anti-dop­ing lab­o­ra­tory as well as its sports min­istry.</p>
