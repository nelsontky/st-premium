    <p>One les­son can be drawn from the re­cent United States pres­i­den­tial election: Na­tional lead­ers have a duty to unite the peo­ple they lead in the face of forces that threaten to pull them apart. Only then can their so­ci­eties stay strong and make progress, says Ly­dia Lim.</p>
    <p>What a leader does and says mat­ters, but build­ing cul­ture is hard work. There will be push­back. It takes time, ed­u­ca­tion and prac­tice to change minds and hearts.</p>
    <p>I hope po­lit­i­cal par­ties will do their part to help their sup­port­ers learn new norms to guide their ex­changes with op­po­nents.</p>
    <p>I hope that as part of cit­i­zen­ship ed­u­ca­tion, schools will find ways to teach stu­dents the skills they need to en­gage in a ro­bust con­test of ideas, with­out re­sort­ing to at­tacks on one an­other.</p>
    <p>The peo­ple we dis­agree with are here to stay. We need to live with one an­other as fel­low ci­ti­zens, not en­e­mies.</p>
    <p>I was struck by how US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den reached out to Trump vot­ers in his vic­tory speech.</p>
    <p>“I un­der­stand your dis­ap­point­ment tonight. I’ve lost a cou­ple of elec­tions my­self,” he said, hours af­ter he was de­clared the win­ner on his third try at the pres­i­dency, and hav­ing won 50.8 per cent of the votes cast to Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s 47.4 per cent.</p>
    <p>“But now, let’s give each other a chance,” Mr Bi­den added. “It’s time to put away the harsh rhetoric. To lower the tem­per­a­ture. To see each other again. To lis­ten to each other again.</p>
    <p>“To make progress, we must stop treat­ing our op­po­nents as our en­emy. We are not en­e­mies. We are Amer­i­cans.”</p>
    <p>It is, of course, far eas­ier to say those words than to put them into prac­tice. And even if Mr Bi­den means to do so, his party mem­bers and sup­port­ers may not feel the same. But if there is one les­son I draw from the re­cent United</p>
    <p>States pres­i­den­tial election, it is this: Na­tional lead­ers have a duty to unite the peo­ple they lead in the face of forces that threaten to pull them apart. Only then can their so­ci­eties stay strong and make progress.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing won the election, Mr Bi­den now faces an even tougher chal­lenge – that of try­ing to gov­ern a deeply di­vided coun­try.</p>
    <p>What lessons might Sin­ga­pore draw from the US ex­pe­ri­ence as its pol­i­tics evolves?</p>
    <p>UNITY IS HARD WORK</p>
    <p>At the rul­ing Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) con­fer­ence on Sun­day, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat was frank about what lies ahead, telling party cadres that elec­tions are set to get tougher, and warn­ing that sharper con­tes­ta­tion can spi­ral into un­sta­ble and di­vided pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>“We have seen this hap­pen in other coun­tries, where po­lit­i­cal op­por­tunists seek po­lit­i­cal gains in the ex­treme ends of is­sues and by ap­peal­ing to spe­cial in­ter­ests,” he said.</p>
    <p>While such po­lar­i­sa­tion has not taken root in Sin­ga­pore, the na­tion is not im­mune to such pres­sures, Mr Heng added, cit­ing how anti-for­eigner sen­ti­ments can be eas­ily stirred up.</p>
    <p>Race, re­li­gion and in­equal­ity are other fault lines that can greatly di­vide Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ety, he said, adding: “We must take an in­clu­sive ap­proach to serve all Sin­ga­pore­ans, and not pit one group against an­other. If our unity is lost, Sin­ga­pore will stum­ble.”</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong went one step fur­ther, say­ing that core to the iden­tity of the PAP – which has gov­erned Sin­ga­pore since 1959 – is that it rep­re­sents all Sin­ga­pore­ans, and not just a par­tic­u­lar sliver or seg­ment of the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Once again, the chal­lenge is for the rul­ing party to put those uni­fy­ing words into prac­tice as pres­sure builds on its lead­ers to de­liver not just on so­cial and eco­nomic goods, but also make way for more al­ter­na­tive voices and open the Gov­ern­ment to greater scru­tiny.</p>
    <p>That is the bur­den of suc­cess, the price of dom­i­nance, in a so­ci­ety where some seg­ments are be­com­ing more crit­i­cal of the sta­tus quo.</p>
    <p>DI­VERSE AND NOISY</p>
    <p>Although Sin­ga­pore­ans have long lived with dif­fer­ences of race, re­li­gion, place of ori­gin and wealth, the di­verse polity of to­day dif­fers from that of the past in be­ing more vo­cif­er­ous.</p>
    <p>For many years, the Gov­ern­ment kept the peace by set­ting lim­its on what could be said in pub­lic and by whom.</p>
    <p>It did so through a com­bi­na­tion of laws and in­flu­ence, set­ting “out-of-bounds mark­ers”, a phrase bor­rowed from the sport of golf, where it refers to those ar­eas out­side the golf course from which play is not al­lowed.</p>
    <p>Those lim­its on ex­pres­sion are far more dif­fi­cult to en­force to­day as a grow­ing num­ber of Sin­ga­pore­ans find their voice and turn to a range of chan­nels – on­line and off – to pub­lish and spread their views.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, new ten­sions are com­ing to the fore, aris­ing from two types of in­for­ma­tion. The first is mis­in­for­ma­tion or fake news, spread out of ig­no­rance or mal­ice. The sec­ond is dis­sent, de­fined by Cam­bridge Dic­tionary as a strong dif­fer­ence of opin­ion on a par­tic­u­lar sub­ject, es­pe­cially about an of­fi­cial sug­ges­tion or plan or a pop­u­lar be­lief.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment has sought to rein in mis­in­for­ma­tion through a law – the Pro­tec­tion from On­line False­hoods and Ma­nip­u­la­tion Act – which has it­self proven con­tro­ver­sial be­cause of con­cerns that dif­fer­ences of opin­ion might be cast as false­hoods and out­lawed.</p>
    <p>Such con­cerns arise pre­cisely be­cause the Sin­ga­pore es­tab­lish­ment is of­ten wary of dis­sent and bad at deal­ing with dis­agree­ment.</p>
    <p>That needs to change.</p>
    <p>Dis­sent is le­git­i­mate and nor­mal in a de­vel­oped coun­try. The con­tes­ta­tion of ideas is a nec­es­sary part of democ­racy, to quote Pro­fes­sor Tommy Koh, who has been stead­fast in urg­ing the</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment to ac­cept</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s</p>
    <p>“lov­ing crit­ics”.</p>
    <p>“We should, there­fore, not black­list in­tel­lec­tu­als, artists and writ­ers just be­cause they are crit­i­cal of the Gov­ern­ment or hold dis­sent­ing views. We should wel­come crit­i­cism as long as the critic loves Sin­ga­pore and is not out to de­stroy Sin­ga­pore,” he said in Oc­to­ber last year.</p>
    <p>Surely, the way for­ward for a global city like Sin­ga­pore lies not in sup­press­ing views that chal­lenge the sta­tus quo or dom­i­nant nar­ra­tive, but in equip­ping ci­ti­zens with the skills they need to read and en­gage crit­i­cally with in­for­ma­tion, and to dis­agree with one an­other con­struc­tively and re­spect­fully.</p>
    <p>OP­PO­NENTS, NOT EN­E­MIES</p>
    <p>This will re­quire a new po­lit­i­cal cul­ture that breaks from the past. We need a new way to do pol­i­tics here, based on norms of ci­vil­ity, re­spect and fair play. We must ar­gue ro­bustly when needed and fight for the things we care about, but al­ways en­gage with one an­other as fel­low ci­ti­zens, not en­e­mies.</p>
    <p>We must re­sist the temp­ta­tion, as Mr</p>
    <p>Heng said, to pit one group against an­other.</p>
    <p>PM Lee took an im­por­tant step in July, af­ter a highly con­tested gen­eral election which saw the PAP lose 10 seats to the Work­ers’ Party (WP) – the rul­ing party’s big­gest loss since in­de­pen­dence in 1965.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the re­sults were an­nounced, Mr Lee called to con­grat­u­late WP chief Pri­tam Singh and ex­pressed his in­tent to for­mally des­ig­nate Mr Singh Leader of the Op­po­si­tion, with staff and re­sources to sup­port him in the car­ry­ing out of his du­ties.</p>
    <p>Ex­plain­ing his de­ci­sion later, Mr Lee said the re­sults of GE2020 showed a strong de­sire among Sin­ga­pore­ans for a greater di­ver­sity of views in pol­i­tics and that this trend was here to stay.</p>
    <p>“We have to give ex­pres­sion to it, and evolve our po­lit­i­cal sys­tem to ac­com­mo­date it, while main­tain­ing our co­he­sion and sense of na­tional pur­pose,” he said as he was sworn in as prime min­is­ter for a new term of gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>What a leader does and says mat­ters, but build­ing cul­ture is hard work. There will be push­back.</p>
    <p>It takes time, ed­u­ca­tion and prac­tice to change minds and hearts.</p>
    <p>I hope po­lit­i­cal par­ties will do their part to help their sup­port­ers learn new norms to guide their ex­changes with op­po­nents.</p>
    <p>I hope that as part of cit­i­zen­ship ed­u­ca­tion, schools will find ways to teach stu­dents the skills they need to en­gage in a ro­bust con­test of ideas, with­out re­sort­ing to at­tacks on one an­other.</p>
    <p>I hope more ci­ti­zens, my­self in­cluded, will prac­tise ci­vil­ity and mu­tual re­spect when we dis­agree so that we can stay en­gaged, rather than cut one an­other off or de­scend into de­mon­i­sa­tion of the other.</p>
    <p>The work of build­ing a healthy po­lit­i­cal cul­ture is never done, as ev­i­dent from events in Amer­ica, the world’s old­est democ­racy.</p>
    <p>Po­lar­i­sa­tion is a real threat to a na­tion’s pre­cious unity.</p>
    <p>The an­swer can­not be to elim­i­nate dis­agree­ment, which is im­pos­si­ble, but to in­stil shared norms of ci­vil­ity and re­spect to serve as a bul­wark.</p>
    <p>We can do this to­gether. We are not en­e­mies. We are Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
