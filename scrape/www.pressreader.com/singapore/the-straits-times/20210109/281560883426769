    <p>Hours af­ter Tokyo’s sec­ond state of emer­gency went into ef­fect yes­ter­day, vet­eran In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee (IOC) of­fi­cial Dick Pound warned that the Games are not cer­tain to go ahead in July ow­ing to the lat­est coro­n­avirus wave in Ja­pan. But the or­gan­is­ers main­tain that they will plan for a safe and se­cure event.</p>
    <p>TOKYO • A high-pro­file mem­ber of the Olympic move­ment has said that the ever-chang­ing na­ture of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic meant no­body could be sure whether the Games would go ahead in less than 200 days.</p>
    <p>“I can’t be cer­tain be­cause the on­go­ing ele­phant in the room would be the surges in the virus,” Cana­dian Dick Pound, the In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee’s (IOC) long­est-serv­ing mem­ber told the BBC.</p>
    <p>Over 15,000 ath­letes from al­most ev­ery coun­try in the world are ex­pected to de­scend on Tokyo for the Olympics, which start on July 23, and the sub­se­quent Par­a­lympics.</p>
    <p>Fears over whether the Games can be held in Tokyo have in­creased in the last few weeks as Covid-19 cases surge in Ja­pan and around the world.</p>
    <p>Pound’s com­ments come on the back of Games host Ja­pan declar­ing a one-month state of emer­gency in the cap­i­tal, Tokyo, and three neigh­bour­ing pre­fec­tures on Thurs­day to stem the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga this week in­sisted he was still com­mit­ted to hold­ing the Games as “proof of mankind’s vic­tory over the virus”.</p>
    <p>The Games or­gan­is­ers also in­sisted that the emer­gency would not de­rail plans.</p>
    <p>“This dec­la­ra­tion of emer­gency of­fers an op­por­tu­nity to get the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion un­der con­trol and for Tokyo 2020 to plan for a safe and se­cure Games this sum­mer, and we will pro­ceed with the nec­es­sary prepa­ra­tions ac­cord­ingly,” they said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>But the emer­gency is likely to harden public opin­ion, with a ma­jor­ity al­ready op­posed to hold­ing the qua­dren­nial Games this year even be­fore the third wave wors­ened.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan has yet to ap­prove a coro­n­avirus vac­cine, with Mr Suga say­ing that he hopes the first jabs can be­gin late next month.</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion around the rest of the world is no bet­ter, with much of Europe and the United States also in the grip of a sec­ond or third wave of the virus.</p>
    <p>The US counted a record num­ber of daily coro­n­avirus deaths on Thurs­day of nearly 4,000, dur­ing which the coun­try notched up 265,246 new in­fec­tions, ac­cord­ing to data from Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, the day Eng­land went into a lock­down, Bri­tain recorded 62,322 new coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions and 1,041 deaths.</p>
    <p>The same day, Por­tu­gal – a na</p>
    <p>tion of just 10 mil­lion peo­ple – re­ported 10,000 new cases while Ire­land closed its schools in a bid to bring its own in­fec­tion rates un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>There are also two vari­a­tions of Covid-19 steadily mak­ing their way around the world. The Bri­tish strain and an­other which emerged in South Africa are both be­lieved to be more in­fec­tious ver­sions of the virus.</p>
    <p>Pound, 78, is one of the Olympic move­ment’s most vo­cal of­fi­cials. A for­mer chief of the World Anti</p>
    <p>Dop­ing Agency, he was one of the first IOC mem­bers to in­di­cate early last year that the Tokyo Olympics were in doubt be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>That even­tu­ally came to pass with the IOC and the Ja­panese gov­ern­ment jointly an­nounc­ing last March that the Games would be de­layed by a year.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, he also told Sky News that ath­letes should be pri­ori­tised for the Covid-19 vac­cines so the be­lea­guered Tokyo Games could go ahead.</p>
    <p>“In Canada, where we might have 300 or 400 ath­letes – to take 300 or 400 vac­cines out of sev­eral mil­lion in or­der to have Canada rep­re­sented at an in­ter­na­tional event of this stature, char­ac­ter and level – I don’t think there would be any kind of a public out­cry about that,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It’s a de­ci­sion for each coun­try to make and there will be peo­ple say­ing they are jump­ing the queue but I think that is the most re­al­is­tic way of it go­ing ahead.”</p>
    <p>I can’t be cer­tain be­cause the on­go­ing ele­phant in the room would be the surges in the virus.</p>
