    <p>Na­tional swim­mer Christie Chue is thrilled to achieve her dream of study­ing and train­ing in the United States and has ac­cepted a schol­ar­ship from Florida In­ter­na­tional Univer­sity to be­gin next Au­gust. The 20-year-old SEA Games cham­pion is also work­ing to qual­ify for next year’s Olympics in the breast­stroke events.</p>
    <p>Two months ago, na­tional swim­mer Christie Chue re­ceived a di­rect mes­sage on In­sta­gram from Florida In­ter­na­tional Univer­sity invit­ing her to fur­ther her stud­ies and train there. Her im­me­di­ate thought was: “Is this a scam?”</p>
    <p>The first thing she did was to show her mum the mes­sage and ask if it was real, be­fore ver­i­fy­ing that it was when she checked the In­sta­gram ac­count and the col­lege’s web­site.</p>
    <p>Even then, the of­fer felt sur­real. “When I found out it was real, it was a shock. I thought, ‘This is not hap­pen­ing’,” said the 20-year-old.</p>
    <p>The breast­stroke spe­cial­ist, who won three gold medals at last year’s SEA Games, had given up her goal of pur­su­ing her stud­ies in the United States af­ter she was re­jected by the Univer­sity of Michi­gan two years ago. She had trained full-time in Sin­ga­pore from 2018 un­til her en­rol­ment in the In­ter­na­tional Sports Academy last April, where she is pur­su­ing a diploma in sport sci­ence and man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Pur­su­ing a de­gree in the US ap­pealed to her be­cause she had pre­vi­ously heard from friends that there was a bet­ter bal­ance be­tween train­ing and study­ing.</p>
    <p>Hence it did not take much con­vinc­ing for her to ac­cept Florida In­ter­na­tional Univer­sity’s of­fer. She has not de­cided on a course of study but will re­ceive a schol­ar­ship grant of $10,000 in her first year and will be on full schol­ar­ship for the re­main­ing two years.</p>
    <p>Chue, who will en­rol next Au­gust, said: “I didn’t want to miss such a good op­por­tu­nity, so I de­cided to go for it. It wasn’t just swimming; they have ad­vis­ers to help us with our school work if we are be­hind time or need any help and I feel that is what I re­ally need. I’ve been trained here my whole life and I wanted to try some­thing new.”</p>
    <p>The Pan­thers swim team, led by head coach Randy Horner, are in Di­vi­sion 1 of the Na­tional Col­le­giate Ath­letic As­so­ci­a­tion (NCAA) Swimming and Div­ing Cham­pi­onships.</p>
    <p>In his 10 sea­sons in charge, Horner has led the team to five ti­tles in the Con­fer­ence USA, an in­ter-col­le­giate ath­letic con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Chue knows that she will be up against some stiff com­pe­ti­tion in the NCAA, but she rel­ishes the chal­lenge and sees it as a learn­ing op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>“I’m ex­cited about that be­cause I see my friends com­pete in the NCAA and it looks re­ally fun,” said Chue. “Also, be­cause you are com­pet­ing with top swim­mers and many other bet­ter ath­letes, it would be a good chance to see where you stand against US swim­mers and gain ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, three na­tional swim­mers, Quah Zheng Wen (Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, Berke­ley), Quah Jing Wen (Texas A&M) and Dar­ren Lim (Ge­or­gia Tech) are train­ing and study­ing in the US.</p>
    <p>One of the top breast­stroke swim­mers in Sin­ga­pore, Chue had an ex­cel­lent cam­paign last sea­son with her SEA Games ti­tles and four na­tional records.</p>
    <p>Aside from clock­ing new marks in the 100m and 200m breast­stroke last year, she also linked up with her team­mates to re­write the 4x200m freestyle re­lay and 4X100m med­ley re­lay records at the Philip­pines SEA Games.</p>
    <p>Na­tional swimming head coach and per­for­mance di­rec­tor Stephan Wid­mer said he had spo­ken to her about the need to ad­just quickly when goes to the US.</p>
    <p>He added: “She has slowly started to be­lieve more in her abil­i­ties that were al­ways there and took that to an­other level. She’s evolved in a re­ally nice way to get some good re­sults at the SEA Games, but to me, that’s just the start.</p>
    <p>“Time will tell if it’s a good de­ci­sion for her – she will have to adapt very quickly to the US col­lege sys­tem, to new train­ing part­ners, coach­ing staff and so on, so she has to be on the ball about that. It’s a new chal­lenge that she’ll have to adapt to and push for­ward.”</p>
    <p>For now, Chue, who is a part of Swim­fast Aquatic Club, will con­tinue to train in Sin­ga­pore in her bid to qual­ify for next year’s Tokyo Olympics. Her per­sonal bests for the 100m and 200m breast­stroke are 1:09.06 and 2:28.71 re­spec­tively, and she is work­ing on meet­ing the Olympic A qual­i­fy­ing times of 1:07.07 and 2:25.52.</p>
    <p>Her in­tern­ship with the Sin­ga­pore Swimming As­so­ci­a­tion, where she has been work­ing with tech­ni­cal di­rec­tor Sonya Porter to com­pile tim­ing data for the na­tional swim­mers and com­par­ing it with the top 10 ath­letes in the world, keeps her mo­ti­vated in train­ing.</p>
    <p>“When I train, I keep in mind the tim­ings I need to aim for, so it’s a daily re­minder that I need to hit those tar­get times,” she said.</p>
    <p>Be­cause you are com­pet­ing with top swim­mers and many other bet­ter ath­letes, it would be a good chance to see where you stand against US swim­mers and gain ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>CHRISTIE CHUE, na­tional swim­mer, is look­ing for­ward to par­tic­i­pat­ing in the Na­tional Col­le­giate Ath­letic As­so­ci­a­tion (NCAA) Swimming and Div­ing Cham­pi­onships.</p>
