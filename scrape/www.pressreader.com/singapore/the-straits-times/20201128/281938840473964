    <p>When Ms Yang Meng first started live-stream­ing last year, she was ter­ri­fied of freez­ing on cam­era.</p>
    <p>“I was wor­ried that I wouldn’t know what to say, so I spent so much time work­ing on my script,” she said.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old, who was in­charge of e-com­merce for her fam­ily’s lo­cal pro­duce business, had just started to tap live-stream­ing plat­forms to sell dried pep­per­corns and fer­mented tofu.</p>
    <p>One year on, Ms Yang is a pro – on cam­era – rat­tling off to view­ers on why pep­per­corns from her home Yuexi county in Sichuan’s Liang­shan pre­fec­ture are su­pe­rior to those else­where.</p>
    <p>“Our pep­per­corns are larger than those pro­duced else­where and es­pe­cially fra­grant. These pep­per­corns are the soul of Sichuan food,” she said.</p>
    <p>With the grow­ing pop­u­lar­ity of live-stream­ing plat­forms like Douyin and Kuaishou, young peo­ple in China’s ru­ral ar­eas are increasing­ly look­ing to the medium as a way of reach­ing con­sumers in the big cities, hawk­ing lo­cal pro­duce and pro­mot­ing their homes as tourist des­ti­na­tions.</p>
    <p>In one year of live-stream­ing, Ms Yang es­ti­mates that she has sold 300,000 yuan to 400,000 yuan (S$70,000 to S$80,000) worth of pep­per­corns and fer­mented tofu to con­sumers all across China.</p>
    <p>“I feel I don’t need a script any more, after all, no one knows my prod­ucts bet­ter than me,” she said.</p>
    <p>Her fam­ily’s business used to tar­get mostly pro­cess­ing fac­to­ries that would turn the pep­per­corns into the spicy, numb­ing soup bases used in Sichuan hot­pot.</p>
    <p>“But live-stream­ing al­lowed us to reach or­di­nary con­sumers both in Sichuan prov­ince and else­where, it’s a whole new mar­ket for us,” Ms Yang said.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts say that live-stream­ing – once a niche sales chan­nel – will take a larger slice of China’s con­sumer mar­ket post-Covid-19.</p>
    <p>This trend is also be­ing fu­elled by the bur­geon­ing pop­u­lar­ity of short-video shar­ing apps such as Kuaishou and Douyin.</p>
    <p>Sta­tis­tics from the China In­ter­net Net­work In­for­ma­tion Cen­tre (Cinic) show there were 773 mil­lion users of such apps in the coun­try, of which 216 mil­lion were from ru­ral ar­eas.</p>
    <p>There are about 940 mil­lion In­ter­net users in the coun­try, ac­cord­ing to Cinic.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, other young peo­ple in ru­ral ar­eas are us­ing live stream­ing to try and earn a liv­ing and pro­mote their vil­lages to tourists.</p>
    <p>Mr Yang Yang, who lives in Atulie’er vil­lage, a lit­tle ham­let perched atop a 1,500m cliff in Liang­shan’s Zhao­jue county, livestream­ed on Kuaishou and talked about vil­lage life.</p>
    <p>Atulie’er is also known as China’s “cliff vil­lage” and is ac­ces­si­ble only by climb­ing a se­ries of steep steel lad­ders.</p>
    <p>“Most young peo­ple here livestream to in­tro­duce our home to peo­ple out­side and at­tract tourists,” said Mr Yang, 26, who started do­ing it in 2015.</p>
    <p>Al­though he has since stopped, pre­fer­ring to fo­cus on his work run­ning a goat farm and olive or­chard in the vil­lage, he said other young vil­lagers were at­tracted by the in­come gen­er­ated by the medium.</p>
    <p>“You can earn a few thou­sand yuan a month, or even more than 10,000 yuan, from gifts from fans, but this is not a sta­ble in­come,” he said.</p>
    <p>WHOLE NEW MAR­KET</p>
    <p>Live-stream­ing al­lowed us to reach or­di­nary con­sumers both in Sichuan prov­ince and else­where, it’s a whole new mar­ket for us.</p>
