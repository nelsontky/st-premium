    <p>There are a lot of fe­males in mid­dle man­age­ment, but as you scale the cor­po­rate lad­der, they get fewer... is that a real de­ci­sion they get to make or one that is a re­sult of so­ci­etal norms (and ex­pec­ta­tions) of a woman’s role?</p>
    <p>For the head of a global beauty con­glom­er­ate, Ms Nicole Tan is sur­pris­ingly down-to-earth when it comes to her ap­pear­ance.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the photo shoot for this interview, she re­sists hair spray from the make-up artist on standby and fum­bles en­dear­ingly with her poses. “I don’t know what to do with my hands,” she protests weakly.</p>
    <p>Her can­dour be­lies her ti­tle.</p>
    <p>The 45-year-old is Shi­seido Asi­aPa­cific’s first fe­male pres­i­dent and chief ex­ec­u­tive, newly ap­pointed in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>At the Ja­pan-based beauty com­pany’s re­gional head­quar­ters atop Frasers Tower, she is the pic­ture of Ja­panese hospi­tal­ity as she of­fers this reporter green tea and bis­cuits.</p>
    <p>Beauty is in her blood, she says. She has al­ways been drawn to “be­fore-after sto­ries”.</p>
    <p>“How just chang­ing the way you look can trans­form a per­son’s ex­pe­ri­ence and how he or she pre­sents him­self or her­self to the world – that re­ally at­tracted me and I felt I un­der­stood that in­tu­itively.”</p>
    <p>Grow­ing up, she spent her pocket money on beauty mag­a­zines, por­ing through Her World and Cleo to read beauty news and trans­for­ma­tion sto­ries. “I had stacks and stacks of them and my mum used to tell me, ‘this is an ut­ter waste of your money’ – but clearly not,” she says with a laugh.</p>
    <p>Yet her ca­reer be­gan not in beauty, but in an unglam­orous first job at ra­zors and per­sonal care com­pany Gil­lette.</p>
    <p>She grad­u­ated with a de­gree in busi­ness stud­ies from Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity in the thick of the 1997 Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis. Jobs were scarce, but she man­aged to snag a man­age­ment trainee role with Gil­lette.</p>
    <p>After two years, Ms Tan felt she could bet­ter add value to the in­dus­try if she did some­thing “more in­tu­itive” to her­self.</p>
    <p>Beauty com­pa­nies rarely hired fresh grad­u­ates, she re­calls, so she sent cold job in­quiries to mul­ti­ple com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>“I sent many cold CVs, but via courier – so it would not just be in the mail, it would land on the hir­ing per­son’s desk,” she adds con­spir­a­to­ri­ally.</p>
    <p>L’Oreal’s beauty arm an­swered and she was of­fered a po­si­tion with its cos­met­ics brand L’Oreal Paris.</p>
    <p>Her two-year stint there marked the start of what would be a 23-year-long jour­ney in the beauty in­dus­try, which took her to brands in­clud­ing The Body Shop, home­grown Lux­a­sia and Es­tee Lauder Com­pa­nies (ELC), where she spent al­most 15 years.</p>
    <p>To­day, it is still that “crit­i­cal first step­ping stone” for which Ms Tan is most grate­ful.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­body needs a chance. If L’Oreal hadn’t be­lieved that I could make that tran­si­tion from FMCG (fast-mov­ing con­sumer goods) into FMCG beauty, then I would never have got­ten my break.”</p>
    <p>MS NICOLE TAN (left), Shi­seido Asia-Pa­cific pres­i­dent and chief ex­ec­u­tive, on women of­ten hav­ing to choose be­tween their ca­reers and fam­i­lies</p>
    <p>CHART­ING A WOMAN’S WORLD</p>
    <p>There was no drama in mak­ing the move to a ri­val con­glom­er­ate, Ms Tan says, al­though she had kept a keen eye on Shi­seido’s growth and ac­qui­si­tions over the last five years in her pre­vi­ous role. “It was the group to watch.” Be­ing ap­pointed the first fe­male re­gional pres­i­dent and CEO of a beauty com­pany is a mile­stone, she says.</p>
    <p>Iron­i­cally, though women form the ma­jor­ity of the global beauty in­dus­try, it is still largely chaired by men.</p>
    <p>“If you look across the spec­trum of cos­metic com­pa­nies, all of them have male CEOs,” she says.</p>
    <p>The mother of two boys aged 18 and 13 cred­its her hus­band’s un­wa­ver­ing sup­port in her ca­reer.</p>
    <p>In 2015, the fam­ily up­rooted to Shang­hai for her to take a new role set­ting up the China travel re­tail hub for ELC.</p>
    <p>Her hus­band, who is now a ven­ture cap­i­tal­ist, had been work­ing with a sup­ply chain tech­nol­ogy so­lu­tions provider and ne­go­ti­ated with his em­ployer to man­age his team out of Shang­hai.</p>
    <p>“The role and sup­port of the spouse can­not be un­der­mined. My hus­band was al­ways flex­i­ble to work, not around my ca­reer, but in a way that worked well for the two of us,” says Ms Tan. The fam­ily moved back to Sin­ga­pore in June this year.</p>
    <p>She sees her ap­point­ment at Shi­seido as “a strong stance from the com­pany to show di­ver­sity and lo­cal rel­e­vance”.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier in her ca­reer, she says, a head­hunter had dealt her harsh truths about the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“She said there are a l ot of fe­males in mid­dle man­age­ment, but as you scale the cor­po­rate lad­der, they get fewer. Some­times, you get the im­pres­sion that it’s a choice women make for fam­ily.”</p>
    <p>She saw friends and col­leagues bow out of the rat race as their chil­dren grew older, in or­der to spend more time at home and help with stud­ies.</p>
    <p>“But is that a real de­ci­sion they get to make or one that is a re­sult of so­ci­etal norms (and ex­pec­ta­tions) of a woman’s role?</p>
    <p>“I think men have to play a more ac­tive part in help­ing to de­fine gen­der roles. It would be very dif­fi­cult for a woman to suc­ceed in the pro­fes­sional world if she’s ex­pected to do her pro­fes­sional role, then go home and do ev­ery­thing a wife is ex­pected to do.”</p>
    <p>THE NEXT CHAP­TER</p>
    <p>Her move is Shi­seido “putting money where its mouth is”, she says, given the com­pany’s com­mit­ment to im­prov­ing gen­der equal­ity as part of its so­cial sus­tain­abil­ity ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Shi­seido aims to em­power less ad­van­taged women with es­sen­tial skills and sup­port needed for so­cial mo­bil­ity and fu­ture lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>The com­pany set up the Shi­seido Life Qual­ity Beauty Cen­tre last year, pro­vid­ing free ap­pear­ance care coun­selling to peo­ple with se­ri­ous skin is­sues and other side ef­fects from can­cer treat­ment.</p>
    <p>It links back to Ms Tan’s pen­chant for help­ing women feel con­fi­dent through their ap­pear­ance.</p>
    <p>She looks for­ward to chart­ing Shi­seido’s next chap­ter – which, to her, means dou­bling down on sto­ry­telling for its mul­ti­ple brands.</p>
    <p>Apart from the Shi­seido brand it­self, the group owns about 30 oth­ers, in­clud­ing pres­tige la­bels Nars, Laura Mercier, Cle de Peau Beaute and the most re­cently ac­quired Drunk Ele­phant.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan finds this lat­est ac­qui­si­tion the most ex­cit­ing. The Amer­i­can skin­care la­bel has a cult fol­low­ing on so­cial me­dia and brings “a very dif­fer­ent cus­tomer pro­file and fresh mar­ket­ing strate­gies” the other brands can learn from.</p>
    <p>She says: “We have so many in­ter­est­ing brands with great sto­ries to tell, but we’re a bit shy; they’re not com­mu­ni­cated. An au­then­tic way to build a con­nec­tion with con­sumers is through the power of sto­ry­telling.”</p>
    <p>Strength­en­ing the con­sumer con­nec­tion and “speak­ing their lan­guage” is es­pe­cially cru­cial in a post­pan­demic era, which has changed how and where con­sumers shop.</p>
    <p>“(An event like) the pan­demic forces you to look at what you’ve been do­ing and how you can fine­tune that to do even bet­ter,” she says, point­ing out that though Covid-19 may have briefly up­ended the make-up in­dus­try, Shi­seido has been “grow­ing by leaps” since 2015.</p>
    <p>“The busi­ness will still be chal­lenged, but if you can be more rel­e­vant to the con­sumer in meet­ing his or her needs, you will be in a bet­ter po­si­tion than the next best guy.”</p>
    <p>In the short term, that means piv­ot­ing to ad­dress evolv­ing needs such as eye make-up and maskre­lated skin con­cerns, al­though Shi­seido has al­ready seen re­cov­ery in re­gional mar­kets since July.</p>
    <p>“Com­ing into the job at this time is chal­leng­ing, but there will be an up,” Ms Tan says con­fi­dently. “This is an op­por­tu­nity to try new things – it can only get bet­ter.”</p>
