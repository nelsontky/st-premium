    <p>I’ve come to re­alise I will never not be a doc­tor, even if I never prac­tise again. AC­TOR-CO­ME­DIAN KEN JEONG (left)</p>
    <p>How do you tell your Asian im­mi­grant par­ents you want to be an ac­tor and not a doc­tor?</p>
    <p>Ken Jeong was a prac­tis­ing physi­cian when he gave it up to chase a ca­reer in show busi­ness, even­tu­ally go­ing on to steal scenes in The Hang­over come­dies (2009 to 2019) and the sit­com Com­mu­nity (2009 to 2013).</p>
    <p>But Covid-19 has brought out his in­ner doc­tor, the 51-year-old Amer­i­can ac­tor-co­me­dian tells The Straits Times in a tele­phone chat from his Los An­ge­les home.</p>
    <p>You are a celebrity pan­el­list on the Amer­i­can ver­sion of The Masked Singer (2019 to now), where masked con­tes­tants – also celebri­ties – com­pete anony­mously to be named the best singer. The for­mat, which orig­i­nated in South Korea, has been a huge hit in the United States. Were you sur­prised?</p>
    <p>I’m of Korean de­scent and my mum, although she lives in the States, watches a lot of Korean tele­vi­sion and is a big fan of the orig­i­nal The Masked Singer. So when I was ap­proached to be a pan­el­list, I ran it by her and she sent me links to her favourite mo­ments on the Korean ver­sion. That con­vinced me to do this.</p>
    <p>I also host I Can See Your Voice, which de­buted in the US in Septem­ber and is an adap­ta­tion of a South Korean game show. I asked my mum about it, she walked me through some episodes and now I do that.</p>
    <p>So the point is: Just lis­ten to your mum and ev­ery­thing will be all right. That’s kind of what has hap­pened in the last few years. My mum must be de­mand­ing a 10 per cent cut right now.</p>
    <p>You and the other celebrity pan­el­lists try to guess, along with the au­di­ence, who the masked singers are. Any point­ers on how to make a good guess?</p>
    <p>Watch­ing the show is like play­ing black­jack at a casino – the house al­ways wins.</p>
    <p>So how can you stay com­pet­i­tive with the house? I think the clue pack­ages – (hints the show drops about the singers’ iden­ti­ties) – are re­ally im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>And some­times, the per­for­mances can dis­tract you from the clues; they do for me.</p>
    <p>I’m not a pro­fes­sional mu­si­cian, so just when I go down one al­ley­way with the clues, the per­for­mance changes my mind and some­times, I go down an­other path or over­reach.</p>
    <p>There’s no al­go­rithm for how to do it. And each sea­son, I’ve no­ticed the pro­duc­ers are mak­ing the clues more chal­leng­ing be­cause the viewer does get bet­ter at guess­ing.</p>
    <p>You gave up a med­i­cal ca­reer to be­come an ac­tor. Did your par­ents threaten to dis­own you at the time?</p>
    <p>When I was a pre-med stu­dent at Duke University and dis­cov­er­ing my love of act­ing, it was def­i­nitely a cross­roads of what to do, be­cause this was 30 years ago and not many Asian Amer­i­cans were in en­ter­tain­ment.</p>
    <p>So it’s not sur­pris­ing that any­body would be un­der­stand­ably hes­i­tant (about their child choos­ing act­ing as a ca­reer). I don’t see any­thing wrong with that, es­pe­cially if you love your chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Iron­i­cally, I went back into doc­tor mode dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic be­cause I wanted to break down what was go­ing on, and how to stay safe, healthy and in­formed.</p>
    <p>I’ve come to re­alise I will never not be a doc­tor, even if I never prac­tise again. And with this pan­demic, it’s like in The God­fa­ther III (1990) when Al Pa­cino’s char­ac­ter goes: “Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in”.</p>
    <p>And ev­ery­one has asked me med­i­cal ques­tions on ev­ery sin­gle project I’ve ever done. If I don’t know the an­swer, I have a great re­source – my wife (Tran Ho, 47), who is an ac­tive physi­cian.</p>
    <p>Are you en­cour­aged by Hol­ly­wood’s moves to­wards greater eth­nic di­ver­sity and would you want your chil­dren to work in the in­dus­try?</p>
    <p>As a proud Korean Amer­i­can, it’s re­ally im­por­tant. That’s why the Net­flix an­i­mated film this year, Over The Moon, with an all AsianAmer­i­can voice cast, and the film Crazy Rich Asians (2019) are two of the most im­por­tant projects I’ve ever been a part of.</p>
    <p>I have two (13-year-old) daugh­ters and they may want to go into en­ter­tain­ment, so I want to show them that it’s a sus­tain­able pro­fes­sion to be a part of, whether one is per­form­ing, writ­ing, act­ing or direct­ing.</p>
    <p>To me, it’s a won­der­ful pro­fes­sion.</p>
    <p>I was just telling my daugh­ter that there’s no other pro­fes­sion where you can chan­nel your per­son­al­ity and emo­tions into your work ev­ery day. And you can re­ally put your mark on it.</p>
    <p>The Masked Singer 4 airs on Thurs­days at 9.45pm on Blue Ant En­ter­tain­ment (StarHub TV Chan­nel 509, Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 318).</p>
