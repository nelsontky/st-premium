    <p>Sin­ga­pore has seen a rise in the num­ber of peo­ple with Covid-19 en­ter­ing the coun­try since it re­opened its bor­ders to more long-term pass hold­ers on June 19. The 239 cases who tested pos­i­tive after com­ing here since then rep­re­sent al­most 30 per cent of all im­ported cases in the Repub­lic.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has seen a rise in the num­ber of peo­ple with Covid-19 en­ter­ing the coun­try since it re­opened its bor­ders to more longterm pass hold­ers on June 19.</p>
    <p>The 239 cases who tested pos­i­tive after com­ing into the coun­try since then rep­re­sent al­most 30 per cent of all im­ported cases in the Repub­lic.</p>
    <p>None­the­less, the in­fec­tions rep­re­sent only a tiny pro­por­tion of peo­ple en­ter­ing the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health (MOH) told The Straits Times that there were more than 83,000 ar­rivals here by land, sea and air be­tween June 18 and Aug 6 (ex­clud­ing those ar­riv­ing by lorry for de­liv­er­ies). Only 152 im­ported cases were re­ported dur­ing the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>About eight in 10 of those in­fected had ar­rived from In­dia and the Philip­pines – two coun­tries which pro­vide a large pro­por­tion of Sin­ga­pore’s for­eign work­force, and both of which have suf­fered a spike in in­fec­tion rates.</p>
    <p>To pre­vent the in­fec­tion from spread­ing in the com­mu­nity, all in­com­ing trav­ellers have to serve a 14-day stay-home no­tice (SHN), and are tested for the virus be­fore this is over.</p>
    <p>The re­cent rise in im­ported cases led some ST read­ers to ask why trav­ellers are not swabbed im­me­di­ately after they ar­rive, in­stead of at the tail end of their 14-day SHN pe­riod.</p>
    <p>MOH ex­plained that the coro­n­avirus has an av­er­age in­cu­ba­tion pe­riod of five to six days, with a max­i­mum of 14 days.</p>
    <p>“A swab test at the point of ar­rival may not pick up cases dur­ing the in­cu­ba­tion pe­riod,” it said.</p>
    <p>No­tably ab­sent from the list of coun­tries where re­cent cases were im­ported from was Malaysia. Some read­ers had ex­pressed con­cern about trav­ellers from Sin­ga­pore’s im­me­di­ate neigh­bour fol­low­ing news of the spe­cial travel ar­range­ments be­tween the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>There have been no im­ported cases from Malaysia since at least April 27.</p>
    <p>Un­der spe­cial travel ar­range­ments such as the pe­ri­odic com­mut­ing ar­range­ment (PCA), trav­ellers from Malaysia un­dergo a short­ened seven-day SHN and a swab test.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong said ear­lier this month that the SHN was short­ened be­cause Covid-19 preva­lence rates in Malaysia are sim­i­lar to Sin­ga­pore’s or lower.</p>
    <p>“There­fore, the risk of in­fec­tion is quite sim­i­lar to a fel­low Sin­ga­porean,” he said.</p>
    <p>MOH’s di­rec­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices Ken­neth Mak had said that most symp­to­matic visi­tors dis­play symp­toms within five or six days of en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“That al­lowed us then to think about con­sid­er­ing short­en­ing the du­ra­tion of SHN for coun­tries where the orig­i­nal preva­lence (of Covid-19) in that coun­try was low,” he said.</p>
    <p>Those trav­el­ling un­der the re­cip­ro­cal green lane (RGL) scheme also need to be swabbed for the virus and must iso­late them­selves un­til neg­a­tive re­sults are re­turned. They can stay a max­i­mum of 14 days, and must fol­low a pre-de­clared con­trol itin­er­ary.</p>
    <p>The ar­range­ments al­low em­ploy­ers to travel for es­sen­tial meet­ings and give work­ers op­por­tu­ni­ties to see their fam­i­lies more of­ten.</p>
    <p>The cross-bor­der travel ar­range­ments be­tween Sin­ga­pore and</p>
    <p>Malaysia kicked off on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s For­eign Min­is­ter Hisham­mud­din Hussein said last month that 2,000 Malaysians and Sin­ga­pore­ans are al­lowed to cross daily un­der the PCA.</p>
    <p>Un­der the RGL, 400 Malaysians and Sin­ga­pore­ans can travel to and fro be­tween the two coun­tries a week.</p>
