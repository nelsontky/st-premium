    <p>LON­DON Amer­i­can stream­ing plat­form Net­flix has re­jected a call from Bri­tain’s cul­ture min­is­ter to add dis­claimers at the start of episodes of its hit se­ries The Crown (2016 to present), to make clear that it is a work of fic­tion, sev­eral Bri­tish me­dia re­ported on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Cul­ture Sec­re­tary Oliver Dow­den (above) is among sev­eral prom­i­nent fig­ures in Bri­tain who have ar­gued that the scripted se­ries, in which ac­tors play mem­bers of the royal family, risked giv­ing view­ers a wrong and dam­ag­ing im­pres­sion of the roy­als.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the re­ports, Mr Dow­den and Net­flix ex­changed cor­re­spon­dence about the is­sue.</p>
    <p>Net­flix did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to an e-mail from Reuters re­quest­ing com­ment, and a spokesman for the cul­ture min­istry in Lon­don de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>Net­flix was quoted by me­dia re­ports as say­ing it was con­fi­dent its view­ers knew the se­ries was loosely based on true events.</p>
    <p>“We have al­ways pre­sented The</p>
    <p>Crown as a drama – and we have ev­ery con­fi­dence our mem­bers un­der­stand it’s a work of fic­tion that’s broadly based on his­tor­i­cal events,” it said. “As a re­sult, we have no plans – and see no need – to add a dis­claimer.”</p>
    <p>Mr Dow­den had told The Mail on Sun­day on Nov 28 that The Crown was “a beau­ti­fully pro­duced work of fic­tion”, but he was con­cerned that a gen­er­a­tion of view­ers who did not live through the events de­picted may mis­take fic­tion for fact.</p>
    <p>While many Bri­tish view­ers have en­joyed watch­ing The Crown, the most re­cent sea­son has at­tracted crit­i­cism from some com­men­ta­tors over scenes sug­gest­ing that the late Princess Diana was treated coldly, even cru­elly, by se­nior roy­als.</p>
    <p>Colum­nist Si­mon Jenk­ins of the Guardian news­pa­per ac­cused the fourth sea­son of hav­ing “upped the fab­ri­ca­tion and the of­fence”.</p>
    <p>Ar­gu­ing that mod­ern his­tory was “too close to what should be sa­cred ground – bear­ing wit­ness to pass­ing events”, he wrote that artis­tic li­cence could not jus­tify fab­ri­ca­tions that showed liv­ing or re­cently dead peo­ple in the worst pos­si­ble light.</p>
