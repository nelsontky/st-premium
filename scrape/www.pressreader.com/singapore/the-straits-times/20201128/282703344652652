    <p>He has played foot­ball since he was four, rep­re­sented Brazil at the Un­der-17 World Cup in 2007 and played in North Africa, the Middle East, In­done­sia and Malaysia.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary, Luiz Ju­nior ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore in high spir­its, ready to help Tan­jong Pa­gar United make their mark in the Sin­ga­pore Pre­mier League (SPL) after a fiveyear ab­sence. But dis­as­ter struck in the third game against Al­birex Ni­igata on March 20 as Ju­nior frac­tured his left shin bone.</p>
    <p>A month later, he was dealt a fur­ther blow when travel re­stric­tions be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pre­vented his wife and daugh­ter, who turns 10 next month, from trav­el­ling here. They are still in Rio de Janeiro.</p>
    <p>Ju­nior told The Straits Times that this is the longest he has gone with­out see­ing his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“I only know how to play foot­ball. If I don’t, I be­come crazy,” the 30-year-old said. “If my fam­ily were here with me, they could help me stay re­laxed but I had to re­cover alone. It’s not the same with­out them.</p>
    <p>“I miss them very much, my daugh­ter video calls me ev­ery day and some­times she’s cry­ing. Ev­ery­thing I do is be­cause of them. I’m play­ing foot­ball for them.”</p>
    <p>De­spite the heartache, his per­for­mances on the field have not been af­fected. He is the club’s top scorer with five goals from his last seven matches.</p>
    <p>The for­ward said he is only at 85 per cent fit­ness and still feels some pain, but paid trib­ute to Tan­jong Pa­gar team man­ager Noh Alam Shah and coach Has­rin Jailani for their pa­tience.</p>
    <p>He said: “The coaches gave me time to train and re­cover well. They never put pres­sure on me and told me to play only when I have no pain... that’s why I can re­lax, play well and score goals for the club.”</p>
    <p>His im­me­di­ate pri­or­ity is to help the Jaguars, bot­tom of the eight­team league on five points, earn their first win of the sea­son in the re­main­ing three matches, starting with the game against Hougang United to­day.</p>
    <p>Tan­jong Pa­gar are the only side yet to record a vic­tory this term and Has­rin, who re­placed Hairi Su’ap just be­fore the restart last month, said his team need to start more ag­gres­sively.</p>
    <p>“What we need to im­prove on is... to see char­ac­ters in the team who can take the lead, in­stead of wait­ing for us to go 1-0 down and come back,” said the 45-year-old.</p>
    <p>To­day’s clash will be their third game in seven days but the coach re­mained hope­ful.</p>
    <p>He said: “Ju­nior is very im­por­tant for us. If you look at him, he is in a dif­fer­ent class. He’s still com­ing back from in­jury but I think he will get bet­ter. We’re very happy with his goals for us.</p>
    <p>“Any team that meet us may think it’s a def­i­nite win for them but we will try to stay mo­ti­vated and go all out, and hope­fully, we can spring a sur­prise.”</p>
    <p>Chee­tahs coach Cle­ment Teo is re­ly­ing on de­fend­ers An­ders Aplin and Lionel Tan to shackle the Brazil­ian for­ward.</p>
    <p>Point­ing to their re­cent 2-0 de­feat by Tampines Rovers, Teo said: “They were taught a les­son by (Stags striker Boris) Ko­pi­tovic in the last game and they might lose out on the phys­i­cal as­pect. But I’m con­fi­dent they will get the job done.</p>
    <p>“Ju­nior will be tricky. In­di­vid­u­ally, they’ve been briefed on what needs to be done but it’s a learn­ing process.</p>
    <p>“We have im­proved through­out the sea­son, es­pe­cially in our last game. We were pa­tient and cre­at­ing bet­ter chances. What I could see is de­sire, team­work and de­ter­mi­na­tion of the play­ers and that will be the bot­tom line.”</p>
