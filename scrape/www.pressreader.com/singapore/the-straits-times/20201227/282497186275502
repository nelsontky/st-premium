    <p>This has been a chal­leng­ing year, to say the least, but it has high­lighted some sound fi­nan­cial lessons that we should learn to help pre­pare for fu­ture crises.</p>
    <p>Key among these is to put sav­ings first and to stay in­vested in the mar­ket, de­spite the temp­ta­tions to cut and run.</p>
    <p>It’s also painfully clear that the Covid-19 cri­sis will not van­ish overnight once the new year rolls around so stick­ing to fun­da­men­tals like hav­ing an emer­gency fund and a clear un­der­stand­ing of your fi­nances re­main vi­tal safe­guards for 2021.</p>
    <p>SAV­INGS COME FIRST</p>
    <p>The World Bank fore­cast in June that the global econ­omy would shrink by over 5 per cent this year, mark­ing the deep­est re­ces­sion since World War II.</p>
    <p>Jobs in Sin­ga­pore were also lost as re­trench­ments rose and the to­tal em­ploy­ment shrank.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts stress that it is para­mount amid such gloom and un­cer­tainty to have the se­cu­rity of enough cash in the bank to cover per­sonal ex­penses for six months.</p>
    <p>OCBC wealth ad­vi­sory head Kelvin Goh notes: “Life needs to go on. What the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion has shown is how one needs to plan for the worst-case sce­nario.</p>
    <p>“Com­pa­nies can close overnight, and if one were to de­pend en­tirely on their monthly in­come to get by, it would make for a tough sit­u­a­tion should that in­come stream dry up sud­denly.”</p>
    <p>He adds that ne­ces­si­ties in­clude mort­gage and in­sur­ance pay­ments and ex­penses like chil­dren’s school fees.</p>
    <p>Mr Ian Yim, HSBC’s head of wealth and in­ter­na­tional here, ad­vo­cates the 50-30-20 rule: half the monthly salary goes to­wards es­sen­tial ex­penses; 30 per cent to sav­ings and in­vest­ing; and 20 per cent for dis­cre­tionary spend­ing.</p>
    <p>Pay your­self first, sug­gests DBS head of fi­nan­cial plan­ning and per­sonal in­vest­ing Evy Wee: “This means au­to­mat­i­cally sav­ing a por­tion of your pay cheque the mo­ment it is re­ceived.</p>
    <p>“With dig­i­tal bank­ing, this is easy to ex­e­cute. Sim­ply au­to­mate the monthly trans­fer of this fixed amount from your salary cred­it­ing ac­count to an­other ac­count when your pay comes in.”</p>
    <p>This strat­egy beats just spend­ing the pay cheque and then sav­ing the bal­ance, she adds.</p>
    <p>Any fi­nan­cial plan should also in­clude us­ing the Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) to max­imise sav­ings</p>
    <p>Ms Wee notes: “For ex­am­ple, you can top up your nest egg or that of your loved ones via the CPF Re­tire­ment Sum Top­ping-Up Scheme to lever­age at­trac­tive in­ter­est rates and com­pound­ing.”</p>
    <p>STAY IN­VESTED AS WITH MAR­KET DE­CLINE COMES OP­POR­TU­NITY</p>
    <p>Adopt­ing a long-term and di­ver­si­fied ap­proach can help in­vestors weather storms. The best in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties of­ten present them­selves dur­ing an eco­nomic cri­sis, so be pre­pared to seek them out, adds Ms Wee.</p>
    <p>There have been five eco­nomic re­ces­sions since Sin­ga­pore’s in­de­pen­dence, in­clud­ing this one. A DBS re­search pa­per noted that the av­er­age post-re­ces­sion bull mar­ket re­cov­ery was a solid 141 per cent re­turn over a 381-day pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“The stock mar­ket be­hav­iour in the past four re­ces­sions is on the side of i nvestors who stay i nvested, as­sum­ing one has the hold­ing power to ride out any re­main­ing near-term price un­cer­tainty and sit through a po­ten­tial re­cov­ery over the next 12 months or be­yond,” Ms Wee says.</p>
    <p>Ms Chung Shaw Bee, UOB’s head of wealth man­age­ment for Sin­ga­pore and the re­gion, adds: “It can be daunt­ing to hold on to your in­vest­ments when it seems that ev­ery­one else is sell­ing. The key is to stay fo­cused on your long-term in­vest­ment goals and not be dis­tracted by mar­ket noise such as price cor­rec­tions.</p>
    <p>“To be more con­fi­dent dur­ing mar­ket sell-offs, we rec­om­mend that in­vestors con­sider a ‘time in the mar­ket’ ap­proach and to in­vest a fixed amount on a reg­u­lar ba­sis.”</p>
    <p>For in­stance, dol­lar-cost av­er­ag­ing means i nvest­ing a fixed amount at fixed in­ter­vals so an in­vestor au­to­mat­i­cally buys more units when the price is low. Over time, the ap­proach will lower the av­er­age in­vest­ment cost, trans­lat­ing to po­ten­tially higher re­turns.</p>
    <p>Mr Wil­son Loy, Standard Char­tered Sin­ga­pore’s head of in­vest­ment ad­vi­sory and strat­egy, says in­vestors also have to con­sider their risk appetite, fi­nan­cial sit­u­a­tion and tol­er­ance for po­ten­tial losses.</p>
    <p>“For those who are in­ter­ested in eq­ui­ties trad­ing, we would ad­vise you to start small and get ac­quainted with the var­i­ous as­pects of the stock mar­ket first. Don’t jump in with both feet or put all your eggs into one bas­ket hop­ing to make a quick buck, as you could end up los­ing ev­ery­thing.”</p>
    <p>Stay­ing di­ver­si­fied is important, OCBC’s Mr Goh agrees, adding that an as­set al­lo­ca­tion strat­egy with a good mix of ex­po­sure to var­i­ous as­set classes is nec­es­sary to hedge against volatil­ity.</p>
    <p>Take an in­vestor who had been back­ing the S&P 500 in­dex on Wall Street. While the port­fo­lio was hit badly by more than 30 per cent from the highs in Fe­bru­ary to the depths of March, the in­dex then re­cov­ered strongly.</p>
    <p>At the same time, if an in­vestor’s over­all port­fo­lio had bonds and even pre­cious met­als like gold and sil­ver, their hold­ings would have been re­silient to the swings in the eq­uity mar­ket back in March.</p>
    <p>HSBC’s Mr Yim con­cludes that one key les­son is that with mar­ket de­clines also comes op­por­tu­nity: “This mat­ters to long-term in­vestors be­cause cheaper en­try points to global mar­kets now ex­ist.</p>
    <p>“This means long-term prospec­tive re­turns on in­vest­ments are higher than be­fore, mak­ing them more at­trac­tive for in­vestors with a longer-term time hori­zon.”</p>
    <p>BE PRE­PARED FOR THE NEXT CRI­SIS</p>
    <p>The chal­lenges that arose in 2020 will not mag­i­cally dis­ap­pear, ex­perts note.</p>
    <p>OCBC’s Mr Goh says: “With the world chang­ing rapidly, it’s even more important to be well-pre­pared fi­nan­cially.”</p>
    <p>He notes that an OCBC survey this year found that just half of Sin­ga­pore­ans have enough funds to sus­tain them­selves for six months if they were to lose their job, while 75 per cent are not on track to re­tire at their ideal age or with their ideal life­style.</p>
    <p>Ms Wee points out that pur­chas­ing power with the same dol­lar will shrink over time due to in­fla­tion, so peo­ple should have a re­silient fi­nan­cial plan to pre­serve their wealth.</p>
    <p>Ms Chung sug­gests that in­vestors should also be pre­pared to keep at it for the long haul, as bouts of mar­ket volatil­ity are ex­pected to per­sist next year as the pan­demic con­tin­ues to im­pact economies and sup­ply chains.</p>
    <p>They can also look at grow­ing sec­tors like global health­care, in­clud­ing med­i­cal tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Mr Yim adds that sus­tain­able in­vest­ments such as elec­tric vehicles and de-car­bon­i­sa­tion ini­tia­tives will be­come the “new nor­mal”.</p>
