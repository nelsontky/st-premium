    <p>HOUS­TON • Hur­ri­cane Marco and Tropical Storm Laura tore through the Caribbean and Gulf of Mex­ico on Sun­day, forc­ing thou­sands of coastal res­i­dents in Louisiana and Cuba to flee, and flood­ing roads in Haiti’s cap­i­tal, with dam­age across the re­gion ex­pected to worsen this week.</p>
    <p>Marco, which later weak­ened to a tropical storm pack­ing max­i­mum sus­tained winds of 110kmh, was fore­cast to make land­fall along the Louisiana coast yes­ter­day af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>Laura, which hit the Do­mini­can Repub­lic and Haiti ear­lier on Sun­day, killing at least 10 peo­ple be­fore strik­ing Cuba on Sun­day evening, is fore­cast to strengthen into a hur­ri­cane be­fore making land­fall in Texas or Louisiana on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump is­sued a disas­ter dec­la­ra­tion on Sun­day for Louisiana. He had pre­vi­ously is­sued a sim­i­lar dec­la­ra­tion for Puerto Rico.</p>
    <p>In New Or­leans, Mr Billy Wright spent his Sun­day buy­ing bot­tled wa­ter, non-per­ish­able food and an at­tic axe, which can be used to chop through a roof if flood wa­ters block doors and win­dows. The 33-yearold at­tor­ney lives with his fi­ancee in a one-storey house just blocks from a canal that failed dur­ing 2005’s Hur­ri­cane Ka­t­rina.</p>
    <p>“You’d rather have it and not need it than be stuck in your at­tic with ris­ing flood wa­ters,” he said. “Get­ting two storms back to back is a big con­cern.”</p>
    <p>Laura could strengthen into a Cat­e­gory 2 or 3 hur­ri­cane on the five-step Saf­fir-Simp­son scale for mea­sur­ing hur­ri­cane in­ten­sity and move west, closer to Hous­ton, said Mr Chris Kerr, a me­te­o­rol­o­gist at DTN, an en­ergy, agri­cul­ture and weather data provider.</p>
    <p>Cat­e­gory 2 storms have sus­tained winds of at least 155kmh. The thresh­old for Cat­e­gory 3 storms is 178kmh.</p>
    <p>In the Do­mini­can Repub­lic, at least three peo­ple died, in­clud­ing a mother and her seven-year-old son, due to col­laps­ing walls. Laura knocked out power to more than a mil­lion peo­ple in that coun­try and forced more than a thou­sand oth­ers to evac­u­ate, the au­thor­i­ties said.</p>
    <p>In Port-au-Prince, peo­ple waded waist-deep in muddy wa­ters in some of the worst flood­ing the Haitian cap­i­tal has seen in years.</p>
    <p>The Haitian au­thor­i­ties re­ported seven deaths, in­clud­ing at least two peo­ple swept away in flood­ing and a 10-year-old girl crushed when a tree fell on her home.</p>
    <p>Laura hit east­ern Cuba on Sun­day evening with sus­tained winds of 95kmh down­ing trees and rip­ping flimsy roof­ing from build­ings.</p>
    <p>Crude oil prices rose yes­ter­day as the ap­proach­ing storms shut more than half of oil pro­duc­tion in the Gulf of Mex­ico. En­ergy firms shut more than one mil­lion bar­rels a day of off­shore crude oil pro­duc­tion and work­ers were evac­u­ated from over 100 pro­duc­tion plat­forms.</p>
