    <p>GREAT RAC­ING AGAIN</p>
    <p>De­spite less-than-ideal train­ing stints in Europe due to the pan­demic, there were still plenty of pos­i­tives to take home for sailors Kim­berly Lim, Cecilia Low and Ryan Lo as they cel­e­brated the New Year in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The 49erFX pair of Lim and Low, who have earned Sin­ga­pore a spot at the Tokyo Games, said one of the big­gest lessons has been to be adapt­able.</p>
    <p>They spent three months in Por­tu­gal from Septem­ber and re­turned last month. Lim said: “The last times we were in Europe, we al­ways spent six months there so we had to have proper rest blocks in be­tween.</p>
    <p>“But be­cause we were away from Por­tu­gal for so long this time, when we went for that three months, we made it pretty in­tense so it was a lot of sail­ing, a lot of boat work and gym work.”</p>
    <p>They trained five times a week and com­peted in a few events, in­clud­ing two coaches’ re­gat­tas, fin­ish­ing first and third.</p>
    <p>Lim, 24, added: “It was re­ally good back rac­ing be­cause that’s why we do our sport – to race and com­pete. It was re­ally nice, es­pe­cially hav­ing strong teams to com­pete against in Cas­cais.</p>
    <p>“It was ex­cit­ing and a big morale booster for us with each event we com­peted in.”</p>
    <p>It was also a fruit­ful few months for Lo, who headed to Split, Croa­tia in August. He com­peted in the 2020 Laser Se­nior Euro­pean Cham­pi­onships and Open Euro­pean Tro­phy in Gdansk, Poland, be­fore head­ing to Malta for a train­ing camp.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber’s Laser Se­nior Euro­pean Cham­pi­onships and Open Euro­pean Tro­phy – his first ma­jor event since the Laser Stan­dard World Cham­pi­onships last Jan­uary – he fin­ished 21st.</p>
    <p>The field of 126 in­cluded win­ner Elliot Han­son, Bri­tain’s rep­re­sen­ta­tive for the up­com­ing Tokyo Olympics, and Croa­tia’s Olympic sil­ver medal­list Tonci Sti­panovic.</p>
    <p>Lo, 23, said: “I was def­i­nitely very ea­ger to see how it was like com­pared to other sailors, how (the work we did dur­ing) quar­an­tine had trans­lated into progress.</p>
    <p>“That event showed me, my coach, the Sin­ga­pore Sport In­sti­tute and the Sin­ga­pore Sail­ing Fed­er­a­tion that we were on the right path – that the work we’d done in quar­an­tine, the train­ing in Europe had worked.”</p>
    <p>Un­like pre­vi­ous over­seas tours, which would see the sailors chang­ing lo­ca­tion ev­ery few weeks, there was a lot less trav­el­ling this time ow­ing to the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>They found them­selves fac­ing Europe’s se­cond wave as the num­ber of Covid-19 cases be­gan to sky­rocket in Oc­to­ber and made sure they wore masks and kept their so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties to a min­i­mum.</p>
    <p>Low, 29, said: “We do miss the free­dom be­cause it can feel a bit bor­ing like when we had to be in the cir­cuit breaker. But other than that, we are al­ways to­gether, so it’s not too bad.</p>
    <p>“Through­out the year, we tried to look at the pos­i­tives of the sit­u­a­tion that we’d been put in, in­stead of be­ing sulky about it. All my plans are ru­ined but what we tried to do – think of it as op­por­tu­ni­ties to im­prove our­selves in ar­eas that we couldn’t do pre­vi­ously.”</p>
    <p>With seven months till the July 23-Aug 8 Games, the trio will be on the move again. Lo is head­ing to Abu Dhabi for the Feb 14-21 Asian Sail­ing Fed­er­a­tion Asian Cham­pi­onships – the last Olympic qual­i­fier for his event – and hopes to se­cure his spot in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>Lim and Low are leav­ing in a few weeks, first to Lan­zarote, a Span­ish is­land, for a train­ing camp be­fore they re­turn to Por­tu­gal. They then head to Palma, Spain to com­pete and pos­si­bly France.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic’s sailors have qual­i­fied for ev­ery edi­tion of the Sum­mer Games since 1984, with its big­gest con­tin­gent of 10 sailors in seven events at Rio 2016.</p>
    <p>Lim said: “We’ve spent quite a lot of years on this cam­paign and work­ing to­wards this goal, so the most im­por­tant thing is to be able to be there and per­form.</p>
    <p>“It’s im­por­tant that we re­mem­ber to take our mini-breathers – like what hap­pened last year helped us a lot – dur­ing the seven months to­wards the Games and be ready for them.”</p>
    <p>It was re­ally good back rac­ing be­cause that’s why we do our sport – to race and com­pete.</p>
    <p>KIM­BERLY LIM, who, along with</p>
    <p>49erFX part­ner Cecilia Low, has earned Sin­ga­pore a spot at the Tokyo Games.</p>
    <p>ON THE RIGHT TRACK</p>
    <p>That event showed... that the work we’d done in quar­an­tine, the train­ing in Europe had worked.</p>
    <p>RYAN LO, Laser sailor, who fin­ished 21st in Oc­to­ber’s Laser Se­nior Euro­pean Cham­pi­onships and Open Euro­pean Tro­phy in Gdansk, Poland.</p>
