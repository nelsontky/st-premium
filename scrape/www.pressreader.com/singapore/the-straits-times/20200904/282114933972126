    <p>Work­ers’ Party (WP) MP Den­nis Tan’s al­le­ga­tion that PAP rep­re­sen­ta­tives pulled down posters dur­ing the July gen­eral elec­tion is a se­ri­ous one that he must back up with ev­i­dence, said Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan (Tan­jong Pa­gar GRC), who is also sec­ond as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party, said: “Any­one who makes such al­le­ga­tions pub­licly should sub­stan­ti­ate their al­le­ga­tions with ev­i­dence, more so when such al­le­ga­tions are made in this House.”</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, dur­ing the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress in Par­lia­ment, Mr Tan (Hougang) charged that the PAP had en­gaged in “petty and bad pol­i­tics” dur­ing the elec­tion, and asked if the PAP had “gone back­wards in time” in the way it con­ducted its cam­paign in Hougang.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said a res­i­dent had told him that she saw some­one from the PAP team pulling down WP posters from the orig­i­nal height at which they were placed. Two com­plaints were later made to the Elec­tions Depart­ment (ELD) about the posters be­ing placed be­low the 2.2m min­i­mum height re­quire­ment, and Mr Tan had to get this rec­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing late on Mon­day, the ELD, in a press state­ment, said it did not re­ceive any re­port from Mr Tan about his posters be­ing pulled down, and asked him to file a re­port so that it could in­ves­ti­gate. It said its ap­proach is to get the elec­tion agent to rec­tify the is­sue within three hours, and if this is done, no fur­ther ac­tion will be taken. For the com­plaints it re­ceived about Mr Tan’s posters, it said it adopted the same ap­proach.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan said Mr Tan replied to the ELD on Wed­nes­day, say­ing he did not make a re­port to the ELD dur­ing the elec­tion as he was fo­cus­ing on his elec­tion cam­paign, and that he had no plans to do so now.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Chan said: “In the spirit of con­struc­tive pol­i­tics that we dis­cussed in re­cent days in this House, it can­not be that a mem­ber stands up to raise doubts, and does not fol­low through to sub­stan­ti­ate his al­le­ga­tions.”</p>
    <p>He added: “ELD takes such al­le­ga­tions se­ri­ously and will in­ves­ti­gate them thor­oughly and im­par­tially. This is to be fair to all par­ties in­volved, pro­tect the in­tegrity of the elec­tion pro­cesses and con­tinue to up­hold trust in our elec­tions.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tan was not present in the Cham­ber when Mr Chan spoke yes­ter­day. The min­is­ter asked that the ELD press state­ment and the cor­re­spon­dence be­tween Mr Tan and the ELD be brought to the at­ten­tion of MPs and en­tered into the par­lia­men­tary records.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Mr Mu­rali Pil­lai (Bukit Ba­tok) had asked Mr Tan to ac­knowl­edge that the ELD had been even-handed in han­dling com­plaints it got from all po­lit­i­cal par­ties and can­di­dates, which Mr Tan did.</p>
    <p>SUB­STAN­TI­ATE THE AL­LE­GA­TIONS In the spirit of con­struc­tive pol­i­tics that we dis­cussed in re­cent days in this House, it can­not be that a mem­ber stands up to raise doubts, and does not fol­low through to sub­stan­ti­ate his al­le­ga­tions. ’’ TRADE AND IN­DUS­TRY MIN­IS­TER CHAN CHUN SING</p>
