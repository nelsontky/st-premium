    <p>In a bi­nary world of win­ners and losers, he­roes and suck­ers, United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s per­sonal vic­tory over Covid-19 en­hanced his per­sonal myth to an ador­ing base.</p>
    <p>“Covid, covid, covid,” he has taken to say­ing re­cently, cast­ing it as an overblown phe­nom­e­non am­pli­fied by a hos­tile me­dia to crash the econ­omy and make him look bad.</p>
    <p>“Fire Fauci!!” the crowd has bel­lowed in re­turn, re­fer­ring to the US’ top epi­demi­ol­o­gist An­thony Fauci – that char­ac­ter in a play who has the un­en­vi­able role of bring­ing un­pleas­ant news to the king.</p>
    <p>Yet, if Pres­i­dent Trump loses the White House, one of the char­ac­ters laugh­ing in the shad­ows may well be the coro­n­avirus, which – con­trary to Mr Trump’s sug­ges­tion that it will dis­ap­pear af­ter Nov 3 be­cause it is only a po­lit­i­cal weapon – is still very much around.</p>
    <p>On Nov 3 it­self, the US re­ported more than 90,000 new Covid-19 cases in one day for the sec­ond time since the on­set of the pan­demic. The fol­low­ing day, new cases ex­ceeded 100,000.</p>
    <p>Case num­bers are ris­ing near ver­ti­cally, and the death toll is fol­low­ing suit. This week alone, 21 states have set records for new cases. Three – Mon­tana, South Dakota and North Carolina – had a record num­ber of weekly deaths.</p>
    <p>There is lit­tle doubt that the pan­demic played a ma­jor role in this elec­tion. Cer­tainly, it crashed Mr Trump’s boom­ing econ­omy. Even more sig­nif­i­cantly for his po­lit­i­cal fu­ture, it has driven a surge in mail-in bal­lots.</p>
    <p>Mail-in voting – of­ten called ab­sen­tee voting or vote-by-mail – has steadily gained in pop­u­lar­ity in the US, with vot­ers this year cast­ing a record num­ber of over 65 mil­lion mail bal­lots.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic was a cat­a­lyst. Mul­ti­ple stud­ies show a sig­nif­i­cant surge in voting by mail this past sum­mer, and the ac­tual mail-in bal­lot num­bers for the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion bear that out. The bat­tle for Penn­syl­va­nia, which may yet de­cide the out­come of the elec­tion, hinges on mail-in bal­lots which – in a re­flec­tion of the par­ti­san pol­i­tics that sab­o­taged a uni­fied so­ci­etal re­sponse to the pan­demic – favour Demo­cratic can­di­date Joe Bi­den.</p>

    <p>There is lit­tle doubt that the pan­demic played a ma­jor role in this elec­tion. Cer­tainly, it crashed Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s boom­ing econ­omy. Even more sig­nif­i­cantly for his po­lit­i­cal fu­ture, it has driven a surge in mail-in bal­lots. Mail-in voting – of­ten called ab­sen­tee voting or vote-by-mail – has steadily gained in pop­u­lar­ity in the US.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic was a cat­a­lyst.</p>
    <p>ma­jor con­cern for Democrats, who also give the Pres­i­dent low marks for his man­age­ment of it.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, Repub­li­cans give the Pres­i­dent good marks, or at least a pass, on his pan­demic man­age­ment, and the pan­demic is lower on their list of pri­or­i­ties than the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump him­self weaponised the pan­demic, pounc­ing on a state­ment from Mr Bi­den that he would lis­ten to sci­en­tists and lock down where and when the sci­ence deemed it nec­es­sary. If Mr Bi­den be­comes pres­i­dent, he will ruin the coun­try (“There will be no more</p>
    <p>Christ­mas… no more Fourth of July!!”), Mr Trump has thun­dered at his packed ral­lies.</p>
    <p>Thus, wor­ries over the risk of in­fec­tion from min­gling at voting sta­tions have been more acute among Democrats than among Repub­li­cans. It is quite prob­a­ble that the mas­sive turnout that this elec­tion has seen would not have been that large if there had been no mail-in voting. More Democrats would likely have kept away from voting in per­son.</p>
    <p>In the words of Pew Re­search, mail-in voting re­ceived a big boost ear­lier this year as the pri­mary sea­son ran head-on into the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Mail-in bal­lots ac­counted for just over half of this year’s pri­mary votes cast in the 37 states (plus the District of Columbia) for which data is avail­able,” Pew said last month. “That was roughly dou­ble the mail-in share of the vote in those same ju­ris­dic­tions in the 2018 and 2016 gen­eral elec­tions.</p>
    <p>“On the one hand, this year’s surge in mail-in voting con­tin­ues a years-long trend. But the mag­ni­tude of the in­crease also re­flects peo­ple’s con­cerns about voting in per­son dur­ing the</p>
    <p>Covid-19 pan­demic and changes states made to their voting laws and pro­ce­dures in re­sponse to the pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>“Don’t let it dom­i­nate your life,” Pres­i­dent Trump de­clared when he re­turned to the White House last month af­ter re­cov­er­ing from Covid-19 (partly due to a cock­tail of drugs not read­ily avail­able for an or­di­nary per­son).</p>
    <p>He won that bat­tle, but the coro­n­avirus may have won the war – and it is not go­ing away any time soon.</p>

Ac&#xAD;cord&#xAD;ing to&#xD;&#xA;Pew Re&#xAD;search, the huge in&#xAD;crease in mail-in votes is a re&#xAD;flec&#xAD;tion of peo&#xAD;ple&#x2019;s con&#xAD;cerns about voting in per&#xAD;son dur&#xAD;ing the pan&#xAD;demic.</p>
