    <p>COPEN­HAGEN • World-class bad­minton re­sumed on Tues­day for the first time in seven months although the pres­ti­gious Su­per 750 tour­na­ment, Den­mark Open, saw its en­try list short­ened by the with­drawal of many big names.</p>
    <p>The Odense tour­na­ment, which ends on Sun­day, of­fered to­tal prize money of US$750,000 (S$1 mil­lion) but most play­ers from Asia – in­clud­ing former women’s No. 1 Saina Ne­hwal and fel­low In­dian P.V. Sindhu – with­drew ow­ing to coro­n­avirus con­cerns be­fore the start.</p>
    <p>Men’s world No. 1 Kento Mo­mota was set to make his re­turn fol­low­ing his near-death road ac­ci­dent in Jan­uary and sub­se­quent eye op­er­a­tion, but the Ja­panese had also de­cided not to travel.</p>
    <p>Dane world No. 2 Vik­tor Ax­elsen was also ab­sent as he con­tin­ued his re­cu­per­a­tion from an­kle surgery.</p>
    <p>De­spite the with­drawal, there was still keen in­ter­est in the tour­na­ment with Ja­pan’s No­zomi Okuhara and Spain’s 2016 Olympic cham­pion Carolina Marin, the two top ranked play­ers, set to tus­sle for the women’s sin­gles ti­tle.</p>
    <p>Both got their cam­paign off safely, with the Ja­panese, world cham­pion in 2017, tak­ing 37 min­utes to crush Scot Kirsty Gil­mour 21-7, 21-19 in the first round yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, three-time world cham­pion Marin got off to an even quicker start, brush­ing aside Natalia Per­mi­nova 21-7, 21-15 in 28 min­utes.</p>
    <p>The Rus­sian was sim­ply no match for the hun­gry Spa­niard play­ing in her first com­pet­i­tive tour­na­ment since the All Eng­land in March, when she reached the semi-fi­nals.</p>
    <p>“I feel happy to be back, fi­nally.</p>
    <p>The most im­por­tant thing for us is our health and we have to try to en­joy be­ing back on court, get­ting the com­pe­ti­tion feel­ing be­cause we miss it, and to give our best in ev­ery game,” Marin said.</p>
    <p>Among the lead­ing play­ers in the men’s sin­gles fray is Chi­nese Taipei’s Chou Tien-chen, who emerged from a 46-minute con­test un­scathed yes­ter­day with a 21-16, 21-11 win over Den­mark’s Vic­tor Svend­sen, while Dan­ish ris­ing star An­ders An­ton­sen beat In­dia’s Ajay Ja­yaram 21-12, 21-14 in 37 min­utes.</p>
    <p>An­other ti­tle con­tender, Srikanth Ki­dambi of In­dia, also cleared his first-round hur­dle with a 21-12, 21-18 vic­tory over Toby Penty of Eng­land. Ja­pan’s Kenta Nishi­moto and In­dia’s Lakhsya Sen were among those who ad­vanced to the last 16 on Tues­day.</p>
