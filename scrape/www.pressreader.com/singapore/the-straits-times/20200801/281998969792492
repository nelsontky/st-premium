    <p>What bet­ter way to cel­e­brate the 100th an­niver­sary of women’s suf­frage than by dis­cussing the way it turned out to be a big flop?</p>
    <p>The great cham­pi­ons of the 19th Amend­ment thought that when Amer­ica’s women got the right to vote, they’d im­me­di­ately start to change the na­tion. Pro­mote women’s is­sues, like bet­ter health­care and ed­u­ca­tion. Re­fo­cus pol­i­tics from spe­cial in­ter­ests to the gen­eral good.</p>
    <p>Then in 1920, for the first time, they went to polls across the na­tion with their hus­bands, broth­ers, fa­thers and sons and elected – pres­i­dent War­ren Hard­ing.</p>
    <p>In 1921, Con­gress, with a wary eye on the newly en­fran­chised sex, passed the Shep­pard-Towner Ma­ter­nity and In­fancy Pro­tec­tion Act. It was a mod­est ef­fort to im­prove health­care for the poor by train­ing nurses, li­cens­ing mid­wives and es­tab­lish­ing clin­ics for young moth­ers and their ba­bies.</p>
    <p>The physi­cians’ as­so­ci­a­tions saw it as gov­ern­ment-sub­sidised com­pe­ti­tion – so­cialised medicine! – and hated it. Dur­ing de­bate on the Bill, one op­po­nent claimed the spon­sors were pan­der­ing to busy­body old maids who were al­ways push­ing do-gooder causes.</p>
    <p>“Old maids are vot­ing now,” a col­league re­minded him.</p>
    <p>But the doc­tors kept com­plain­ing, and as time passed, politi­cians be­gan to no­tice that they weren’t hear­ing much from the new fe­male elec­torate. In 1929, the Act was re­pealed.</p>
    <p>The Shep­pard-Towner de­ba­cle was one of the best ex­am­ples of how the ef­fects of women’s suf­frage turned out to be more com­pli­cated than its cham­pi­ons had imag­ined. Ev­ery­thing worked great when it came to the ti­tle cause of giv­ing women the right to vote. But the lead­ers of the move­ment had ex­pected to use the bal­lot to trans­form the na­tion. For a very long time, noth­ing hap­pened.</p>
    <p>Well, ex­cept for Pro­hi­bi­tion. Ban­ning the sale of liquor was one cause that re­ally did bring the women to­gether. Most of them didn’t drink, but their hus­bands did. The up­per-class men re­tired to the study or a club af­ter din­ner to sip some liquor and have fun talk­ing among them­selves. Poor men went off to a sa­loon to get soused, spend­ing the fam­ily’s much-needed cash.</p>
    <p>Many Amer­i­can girls grew up be­liev­ing that vir­tu­ally ev­ery so­cial evil came from al­co­hol. Frances Perkins, the New Deal sec­re­tary of labour, re­called that she was raised to be­lieve that poverty was just a re­sult of drink­ing – and lazi­ness.</p>
    <p>Once Con­gress ap­proved the 19th Amend­ment, the liquor lob­by­ists stam­peded to the state leg­is­la­tures to try to stop rat­i­fi­ca­tion. They won enough bat­tles to leave suf­frag­ists one state short of vic­tory and only Ten­nessee left to vote. All eyes turned to Nashville.</p>
    <p>The state Se­nate voted “yes” while vir­tu­ally ev­ery­body in the capi­tol was get­ting swacked on the lob­by­ists’ free sam­ples. Then it all came down to the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives, where the “no” group had a one-man ma­jor­ity. On Aug 18, 1920, a 24-year-old suf­frage op­po­nent named Harry Burn got up and re­ported to his col­leagues that he’d got­ten a let­ter from his mother telling him to “be a good boy” and help the women’s cause.</p>
    <p>“I know that a mother’s ad­vice is al­ways the safest for a boy to fol­low,” he said. And he switched his vote. Suf­frage ruled.</p>
    <p>That was a great cul­mi­na­tion, and much more fun to re­port than the slog that pre­ceded it. We will re­frain from re­vis­it­ing what suf­frag­ists counted as 480 cam­paigns to get state leg­is­la­tures to sub­mit the is­sue to the vot­ers.</p>
    <p>Some fights had been much, much eas­ier than oth­ers. Law­mak­ers in Wy­oming had ea­gerly voted for the fran­chise in 1869, hop­ing it might be a draw for a ter­ri­tory in which men out­num­bered women six to one. “We now ex­pect quite an im­mi­gra­tion of ladies to Wy­oming,” said The Cheyenne Leader news­pa­per hope­fully af­ter the leg­is­la­ture voted for women’s suf­frage, as well as women’s prop­erty rights and equal pay for fe­male school­teach­ers.</p>
    <p>(There was noth­ing like be­ing a rare commodity to raise the bar on women’s op­por­tu­ni­ties. Back when the first male colonists were set­tling into the New World, they wrote back advertisin­g for fe­male emi­gres, promis­ing they would find a hus­band in a snap, as long as they were “but civil and un­der 50 years of age”.)</p>
    <p>Wher­ever suf­frage ar­rived, there were lots of women who re­sisted the idea of get­ting in­volved. Elec­tion day was, in many neigh­bour­hoods, a rowdy time when po­lit­i­cal par­ties tried to en­cour­age voter turnout with – yes! – free liquor. “Sa­loons, march­ing, drink­ing all day – vot­ing was seen as a very mas­cu­line act,” said Debbie Walsh of the Cen­tre for Amer­i­can Women and Pol­i­tics at Rut­gers Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Theodore Roo­sevelt told a crowd of suf­frage sup­port­ers he was the only per­son in his fam­ily who agreed with their agenda, and urged them to “go and con­vert my wife and daugh­ters”. His young niece Eleanor was among the un­en­thu­si­as­tic.</p>
    <p>I don’t have to tell you that things changed. Women went to the polls more and more with ev­ery gen­er­a­tion. But politi­cians still pre­sumed that they’d vote with their men­folk un­less some­thing very un­usual cropped up.</p>
    <p>When Woodrow Wilson was up for re-elec­tion in 1916, his han­dlers did worry about the “women’s vote” in the states where they al­ready had the fran­chise. The pres­i­dent’s wife had died dur­ing his first term of of­fice and Wilson rather quickly picked up with</p>
    <p>Edith Galt, the widow of a prom­i­nent Wash­ing­ton jew­eller. They wanted to marry right away, but Wilson’s aides were afraid of how the news might af­fect the fe­male elec­torate. In the end, the an­swer was: not much.</p>
    <p>Per­haps vot­ers didn’t hear the gos­sip in po­lit­i­cal cir­cles about what was said to be a hot and heavy pre­mar­i­tal af­fair. (The po­lit­i­cal colum­nist Mur­ray Kemp­ton told me he heard a joke when he was a boy in the 1920s, in which when the pres­i­dent pro­posed, Galt was so ex­cited she fell out of bed. “I think my sainted mother told me that one,” Kemp­ton re­called.)</p>
    <p>Af­ter the Wilson en­gage­ment be­came of­fi­cial, The Wash­ing­ton Post printed a so­cial note con­tain­ing one of the most fa­mous ty­pos in Amer­i­can his­tory: “The Pres­i­dent gave him­self up for the time be­ing to en­ter­ing his fi­ancee.” OK, that’s just an in­ter­est­ing di­ver­sion. But Wilson won, and the con­vic­tion that women were mainly just du­pli­cat­ing the votes of their hus­bands or fa­thers held sway.</p>
    <p>You have to won­der, as the years went on, how many hus­bands were ac­tu­ally re­flect­ing their wives’ opin­ions when they went to the polls. The bal­ance of power within fam­i­lies has shifted dra­mat­i­cally over the past 50 years, mainly be­cause of money. The trans­for­ma­tion be­gan when the coun­try’s post-World War II eco­nomic boom hit the killer re­ces­sion of the 1970s, and ev­ery­one be­gan to re­alise that a whole lot of the fam­i­lies of the fu­ture would not be able to af­ford a mid­dle-class life­style un­less the wives kept work­ing.</p>
    <p>The women’s move­ment com­bined with the hard facts of the econ­omy cre­ated a world in which al­most no one en­vi­sioned young women with a dis­tinctly dif­fer­ent wage-earn­ing fu­ture from men. I’ll never for­get a visit I made to a com­mu­nity col­lege in Con­necti­cut, back around 1980. I was in­vited for some rea­son to speak to a class of young men, and I asked them to de­scribe for me their ideal mate. There were a few po­lite mur­murs about a good sense of hu­mour and fine moral char­ac­ter – then some­one called out: “And a good earner!” I can­not tell you how en­thu­si­as­tic the room be­came over the “good earner” qual­i­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>It took pro­fes­sional politi­cians quite a while to no­tice there was a change go­ing on. Then in 1980, when Ron­ald Rea­gan de­feated then-Pres­i­dent Jimmy Carter, it be­came clear the US had moved on to a whole new po­lit­i­cal wave. Anal­y­sis of the fi­nal tal­lies showed that both sexes favoured Rea­gan, but the women split very nar­rowly while the men went Repub­li­can 55 per cent to 36 per cent. The gender gap was born, and it re­ally turned into a canyon in 1996, when Bill Clin­ton won the women’s vote by a wide mar­gin, while men nar­rowly favoured Bob Dole.</p>
    <p>These days, women go to the polls more faith­fully than men, and they are more likely to vote Demo­cratic. That doesn’t mean they al­ways win. In 2000, women favoured Al Gore for pres­i­dent over Ge­orge W. Bush, 54 per cent to 44 per cent, while the men went for Bush, 54 per cent to 43 per cent. In 2016, the male vot­ers gave us Don­ald Trump in an elec­tion where the gender gap yawned at 11 points.</p>
    <p>But the power is there. Black women, who’ve fought dual bat­tles against racism and sex­ism to ex­er­cise their right to vote, knocked the socks off Demo­cratic or­gan­is­ers in Alabama in 2017 when they gave long-shot Se­nate can­di­date Doug Jones 98 per cent of their vote and vic­tory over Repub­li­can for­mer judge-and-pur­suerof-teenage-girls Roy Moore.</p>
    <p>If 1920s hero­ines like Su­san B. Anthony and Ida B. Wells were around now, they’d be set­ting their tar­gets way higher than the vot­ing booth. We live in an era that’s be­gin­ning to find women run­ning for of­fice al­most as nor­mal as Mum hav­ing a job out­side the home. Nearly a quar­ter of the cur­rent US Con­gress is fe­male, and the pace is pick­ing up all the time. I still re­mem­ber in 2001 when Hil­lary Clin­ton was sworn in to the Se­nate and my young niece in­no­cently asked my sis­ter if men were al­lowed to be in the Se­nate, too. Su­san B. Anthony would have fainted with hap­pi­ness.</p>
    <p>Women who tearily dis­cov­ered in 2016 that they weren’t go­ing to be able to in­tro­duce their daugh­ters to the first fe­male pres­i­dent have mostly got over it. If ev­ery­thing we think we know about the cur­rent pres­i­den­tial race is rea­son­ably true – and noth­ing crazy hap­pens over the rest of the cam­paign – next Jan­uary the coun­try will have a fe­male vice-pres­i­dent, a woman who the vot­ers trusted as sec­ond in com­mand to 78-year-old Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>“Women’s is­sues” – like guar­an­teed qual­ity health­care for all and re­pro­duc­tive free­dom – may still not have univer­sal po­lit­i­cal sup­port. But they’re now po­lit­i­cal goals for a vast swathe of the vot­ing pub­lic, both male and fe­male. And maybe it won’t be too long be­fore some­one’s lit­tle niece in the fu­ture in­no­cently asks her mother whether men are al­lowed to be pres­i­dent, too.</p>
    <p>You have to won­der, as the years went on, how many hus­bands were ac­tu­ally re­flect­ing their wives’ opin­ions when they went to the polls. The bal­ance of power within fam­i­lies has shifted dra­mat­i­cally over the past 50 years, mainly be­cause of money.</p>
