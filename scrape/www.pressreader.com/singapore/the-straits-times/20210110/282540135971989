    <p>No sooner had Cit­i­group an­nounced its new sab­bat­i­cal pol­icy – 12 weeks at 25 per cent pay for em­ploy­ees who’d been at the bank at least five years – than the de­bate erupted: In the highly com­pet­i­tive world of fi­nance, would it be a ca­reer killer to take ad­van­tage of that kind of deal?</p>
    <p>I’m not sur­prised some people asked. In 2018, the av­er­age Amer­i­can full-time em­ployee earned 23 paid days off a year, but used only 17 of them, ac­cord­ing to a study funded by the non-profit US Travel As­so­ci­a­tion (USTA) us­ing data from the Bu­reau of Labour Sta­tis­tics and Bu­reau of Eco­nomic Anal­y­sis.</p>
    <p>That’s six days of paid time off (PTO) left on the ta­ble – the equiv­a­lent of hand­ing a week’s salary back to your em­ployer. When you con­sider that the United States has the rich world’s stingi­est va­ca­tion poli­cies, this be­comes even more de­press­ing.</p>
    <p>Other forms of paid leave – like fam­ily leave – also see a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of people leav­ing time on the ta­ble. Es­pe­cially men. Clearly, Amer­i­cans think they can’t af­ford to take time off, even when their firms are pay­ing them to take it.</p>
    <p>But in many years of look­ing, I’ve seen no data to sug­gest such fears are jus­ti­fied. Some re­search on Amer­i­cans who take their va­ca­tion time, for ex­am­ple, shows they are more likely to get a raise or pro­mo­tion – not less. Ad­mit­tedly, this find­ing also comes from the USTA study, and it shows only cor­re­la­tion, not cau­sa­tion. Maybe only ge­niuses feel en­ti­tled to take all their va­ca­tion time. None­the­less, it should help as­suage the fear that tak­ing time off might hurt your ca­reer.</p>
    <p>Nor will log­ging longer hours help you. In fact, another study – an aca­demic, peer-re­viewed one – found that man­agers couldn’t tell the dif­fer­ence be­tween those who ac­tu­ally worked 80 hours a week and those who were only fak­ing it.</p>
    <p>Rest re­ally does im­prove per­for­mance, mainly by nip­ping burnout in the bud. It’s been well doc­u­mented that over­work has cog­ni­tive, in­ter­per­sonal and phys­i­cal costs, which can eas­ily trans­late into lost pro­duc­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Cyn­ics tend to think that paid time off is some­thing com­pa­nies of­fer to at­tract tal­ent, and then pun­ish em­ploy­ees for ac­tu­ally us­ing. But in the case of Citi’s of­fer, I think it pays to take the com­pany at its word: “People just some­times need a break.”</p>
    <p>Tak­ing a break might even re­mind your col­leagues how much value you con­trib­ute. I know that’s my re­ac­tion to any co-worker re­turn­ing from a break, whether a short or long one: Thank good­ness you’re back! This place has been a mess with­out you!</p>
    <p>OK, I may have per­suaded you to take your va­ca­tion time be­fore it evap­o­rates. But what about a longer break, like a 12-week sab­bat­i­cal?</p>
    <p>We can ex­trap­o­late a bit here from data on parental leave. Re­search pub­lished in the Jour­nal of Ap­plied Psy­chol­ogy that looked at longer leave – those last­ing a year or more, as some new par­ents in Canada and Europe can com­mand – found that be­ing out of the of­fice for that length of time re­ally can cost you. Work­ers might miss ca­reer op­por­tu­ni­ties; their in­dus­try knowl­edge might erode. But leave that lasts six months or less does not show a neg­a­tive im­pact on a per­son’s ca­reer.</p>
    <p>Par­ent­hood does of­ten hurt women’s ca­reers, but that’s not be­cause of ma­ter­nity leave, which in the US tends to be un­paid and short. It’s be­cause em­ploy­ers un­fairly per­ceive moth­ers as less com­pe­tent and com­mit­ted. To pick just one of sev­eral stud­ies doc­u­ment­ing this, re­search led by so­ci­ol­o­gist Shelley Cor­rell showed that moth­ers were of­fered US$11,000 (S$14,600) less in salary, 79 per cent less likely to be hired, and 100 per cent less likely to be pro­moted than women whose parental sta­tus was un­known.</p>
    <p>Men’s ca­reers can be hurt by tak­ing even short pa­ter­nity leave, though that may be slowly start­ing to change. (Bias against fathers is one of the fastest-grow­ing ar­eas of em­ploy­ment dis­crim­i­na­tion.) But there’s no ev­i­dence that tak­ing leave for other rea­sons costs men one whit.</p>
    <p>This is not to say there are never trade-offs be­tween time and money. But at least one study, by pro­fes­sors Ash­ley Whillans, El­iz­a­beth Dunn and their col­lab­o­ra­tors, finds that people who pri­ori­tised time over money re­ported feel­ing hap­pier one year af­ter be­ing sur­veyed, and that pri­ori­tis­ing time over money leads to stronger social con­nec­tion. That’s why one of the best ways we can spend our money is to buy our­selves more time.</p>
    <p>Sup­pose an amaz­ing chance comes up at work and you’re not there to seize it. All I can say is that no one can be ev­ery­where all the time, and many work op­por­tu­ni­ties come around more than once. But the chance to take a sab­bat­i­cal, even one that’s only partly paid? That could be a once-in-a-life­time ex­pe­ri­ence. And there are lots of rea­sons to take a break in the mid­dle of your ca­reer, rather than grind­ing it out un­til re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>Think about it this way: Money is the ul­ti­mate re­new­able re­source. You can al­ways earn more of it. But time is fleet­ing and fi­nite. Once it’s gone, it’s gone.</p>
