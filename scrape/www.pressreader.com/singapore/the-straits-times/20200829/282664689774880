    <p>A Tai­wanese YouTu­ber was shot three times in the early hours of Fri­day at around 2am.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Tai­wanese news re­ports, Chen Chih-han took bul­lets in his arm and leg, but is in sta­ble con­di­tion af­ter suc­cess­ful surgery.</p>
    <p>Chen – of­ten re­ferred to as Guan Zhang (Chi­nese for direc­tor) as he is the owner of a chain of mixed mar­tial arts gyms named Genghis Khan Fit­ness Club in Tai­wan – even went live on Face­book at the scene af­ter the shoot­ing, which took place out­side one of his gyms.</p>
    <p>In the video taken by his com­pan­ions, he is seen ly­ing on the ground wait­ing for med­i­cal as­sis­tance, at times scream­ing in pain. There was blood on the ground.</p>
    <p>At one point, the 41-year-old spoke di­rectly into the cam­era: “If I die from this, I hope every­one can carry on my spirit. Take care of my wife and kids.”</p>
    <p>He has a son and a daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>The video, which has gar­nered about 1.7 mil­lion views, ended when medics ar­rived to take Chen to the hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>The sus­pected per­pe­tra­tor, a 23-year-old man with the sur­name Liu, has turned him­self in.</p>
    <p>It is said that Liu is an ob­sessed fan of Chen and has al­legedly sex­u­ally ha­rassed Chen. When Chen com­plained about the in­ci­dent on­line, Liu was re­port­edly doxxed by other fans of Chen, which en­raged him.</p>
    <p>Chen, a for­mer ath­lete, is known for his an­gry, of­ten ex­ple­tive-filled rants about pol­i­tics in Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>He has 986,000 YouTube sub­scribers and some 1.3 mil­lion Face­book fol­low­ers.</p>
