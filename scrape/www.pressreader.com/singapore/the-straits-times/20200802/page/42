    <h3>LIFE FOOD &amp; DRINK</h3>
    <p>
        Life Food & Drink | The Sunday Times Sunday, August 2, 2020 | C16 Some of Kki’s new offerings Plated Dessert ($24) J ($13.50) Marronnier ($9.50) Teh ($9.50) Fromage ($13.50) This cake is named after the couple’s friend James, who bonded with Mr Seah because they both made concrete planters for a spell.
The edible planter is made with black sesame mousse. It is filled with yuzu cremeux, its brightness tempered with white chocolatem­atcha rice puffs and kinakochoc­olate streusel. Mr Seah’s version of the Mont Blanc features chestnut mousse on chestnut sponge.
The earthiness and richness of these elements are elevated with a bright melange of red fruit in the middle – cassis, strawberri­es and raspberrie­s.
Instead of squiggles of chestnut cream, Mr Seah’s version features an elaboratel­y piped labyrinth. The tea element in this cake is Earl Grey mousse and it sits on hazelnut sponge with pear compote in the middle.
Wisps of cornflower­s adorn the cake, as do the most delicate hazelnut tuiles. Elements such as tuiles are now possible because the cakes are assembled upon ordering. The cheese course of a dessert meal at Kki is a sweet-savoury creation featuring cream cheese and Cambozola, a mild, “entry-level” blue cheese, as Ms Liau calls it.
Figs, prunes and apricots – the dried fruit that might adorn a cheese plate – are soaked in rum for this cake, which also features kinako cookie cubes. This summery dessert features sweet Japanese fruit tomatoes made into sorbet as well as adorning the top, together with strawberri­es.
It sits on red pepper and blood orange coulis, and there are crisp shards of basil sugar tuiles on top. PRINTED AND DISTRIBUTE­D BY PRESSREADE­R PressReade­r.com +1 604 278 4604 ORIGINAL COPY .
