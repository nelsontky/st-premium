    <p>WASH­ING­TON Mr Joe Bi­den’s US$2 tril­lion (S$2.72 tril­lion) plan to fight global warm­ing is the most am­bi­tious cli­mate pol­icy pro­posed by a lead­ing pres­i­den­tial can­di­date, a po­lit­i­cal light­ning rod spot­lighted last Thurs­day night when the Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee ac­knowl­edged dur­ing a de­bate that it would “tran­si­tion” the coun­try “from the oil in­dus­try”.</p>
    <p>But no one knows bet­ter than Mr Bi­den, a for­mer vice-pres­i­dent, that it al­most surely will not be en­acted, even if his party se­cures the White House and the Se­nate. Thirty-six years in the Se­nate and the sear­ing ex­pe­ri­ence of watch­ing the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion’s less am­bi­tious cli­mate plan die a decade ago have taught him the art of the pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Still, a pres­i­dent Bi­den could have real im­pact: so­lar pan­els and wind tur­bines spread across the United States’ moun­tains and prairies, elec­tric charg­ing sta­tions nearly as ubiq­ui­tous as petrol sta­tions, and a grad­ual de­crease in the na­tion’s plan­et­warm­ing green­house gas pol­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>“The oil in­dus­try pol­lutes sig­nif­i­cantly,” Mr Bi­den said at the fi­nal pres­i­den­tial de­bate, adding: “It has to be re­placed by re­new­able en­ergy over time.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s ad­vis­ers in­sist that cli­mate change is not just a po­lit­i­cal slo­gan. And on Capi­tol Hill, his team is al­ready strate­gis­ing with Demo­cratic lead­ers on how they can re­al­is­ti­cally turn at least some of those pro­pos­als into law.</p>
    <p>“There are three things we have to do – cli­mate, eco­nomic equal­ity and democ­racy,” said Se­na­tor Chuck Schumer, who would be­come the ma­jor­ity leader if the Democrats win con­trol of the Se­nate. “All three are vi­tal, and cli­mate is not go­ing to be the ca­boose.”</p>
    <p>If Mr Bi­den wins, he will face a dilemma he knows well – so much to do, and so lit­tle time.</p>
    <p>As a newly in­au­gu­rated vice-pres­i­dent, he and then Pres­i­dent Barack Obama dove first into pass­ing an eco­nomic re­cov­ery Bill in the wake of the 2008 fi­nan­cial cri­sis, then fo­cused on the Af­ford­able Care Act. By the time Congress moved to cli­mate change, the White House’s po­lit­i­cal cap­i­tal was ex­hausted.</p>
    <p>Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Demo­crat, had in 2010 forced the House to ap­prove com­pli­cated leg­is­la­tion to cap car­bon emis­sions, but that “cap and trade” Bill never even came to a vote in the Se­nate. Its pas­sage in the House helped sweep Democrats from power months later.</p>
    <p>“The big­gest fac­tor in not get­ting cli­mate change done in 2010 was health­care,” said Mr Phil Schiliro, who was pres­i­dent Obama’s li­ai­son to Congress at the time. “And this could hap­pen again, with the other things that have to come first. The coron­avirus is such an enor­mous wild card.”</p>
    <p>If Mr Bi­den wins the White House but Re­pub­li­cans main­tain their hold on the Se­nate, then the Demo­crat’s lofti­est cli­mate pledges will cer­tainly die. In that sce­nario, “all Bi­den can try to do is cob­ble back to­gether the Obama en­vi­ron­men­tal agenda”, said Mr Dou­glas Brink­ley, a his­to­rian who fo­cuses on pres­i­dents’ en­vi­ron­men­tal lega­cies.</p>
    <p>That would in­clude, he said, re­join­ing the in­ter­na­tional Paris ac­cord – the agree­ment be­tween na­tions to fight cli­mate change, which Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump is with­draw­ing from – and re­in­stat­ing Obama-era cli­mate reg­u­la­tions. And with a 6-3 con­ser­va­tive ma­jor­ity on the Supreme Court, even that could be thwarted.</p>
    <p>But even a nar­row Demo­cratic ma­jor­ity in the Se­nate would leave a pres­i­dent Bi­den with op­tions. And this time around, Mr Bi­den wants to do it dif­fer­ently, not with a stand­alone cli­mate Bill but by tuck­ing cli­mate mea­sures into broader, pop­u­lar leg­is­la­tion to in­su­late them from par­ti­san at­tack.</p>
