    <p>The dis­rup­tion caused by Covid-19 has pushed some restau­rants to try out a new busi­ness model – sell­ing frozen ver­sions of their dishes.</p>
    <p>The TungLok Group, which op­er­ates more than 10 Chi­nese restau­rants here, is one of the early adopters.</p>
    <p>It set up an on­line store called HomeFi­esta about four years ago to sell frozen dim sum such as siew mai and pork buns. But the last two months have seen its of­fer­ings ex­pand ex­po­nen­tially to more than 50 items, in­clud­ing noo­dle soups and Western dishes such as beef stroganoff.</p>
    <p>It now sells more than 17,000 pack­ets of food on­line a month, rang­ing from $6.80 to $19.80 a pack. Its best­sellers are Chi­nese fare like siew mai, bar­be­cued pork bun and braised pork with pre­served veg­eta­bles.</p>
    <p>Hawker stall Koung’s Wan Tan Mee in Sim’s Avenue sim­i­larly launched a frozen won­ton noo­dle of­fer­ing in end-May, ahead of sched­ule, to tap the grow­ing mar­ket for ready-to-eat meals. It has sold more than 6,000 frozen pack­ets on­line and through phone or­ders.</p>
    <p>Last month, both Din Tai Fung and Par­adise Dy­nasty de­buted their own ver­sion of frozen dumplings, which were swiftly sold out. New stocks will be avail­able soon.</p>
    <p>Frozen dim sum is next in line, with Swee Choon Tim Sum, an old-school eatery in Jalan Be­sar, plan­ning to launch a menu of 15 items at the end of this month. They in­clude car­rot cake ($4.20 for six pieces) and bean curd prawn roll ($7.60 for six).</p>
    <p>The ad­van­tage that frozen meals have over chilled ones is that they can keep for months in­stead of days. They come in handy when hunger pangs strike at odd hours. There is one thing you need though – freezer space.</p>
    <p>Here are five picks to sam­ple.</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>DIM SUM AND MORE FROM TUNGLOK</p>
    <p>The TungLok Group’s ded­i­cated website homefi­esta.tunglok.com lists more than 50 dishes that come frozen in sealed bags and just need heat­ing up be­fore serv­ing.</p>
    <p>I tried some steamed Prawn & Pork Siew Mai ($29.80 for 48 pieces) and my verdict is they are al­most as good as freshly made ones, with the prawns in the fill­ing just a tad less suc­cu­lent.</p>
    <p>The fra­grant and mildly spicy</p>
    <p>Beef Ren­dang ($18, above), heated in a wa­ter bath, was de­li­cious. I loved how soft and moist the meat was. The serv­ing was am­ple for four peo­ple and good value for money.</p>
    <p>Other dishes worth a try in­clude Prawn Paste Chicken Mid Wing ($14.50 for 12 pieces), Braised Beef Shank And Ten­don With Radish ($19.80) and Braised Pork Car­ti­lage Noo­dle With Chicken Broth ($15).</p>
    <p>How to or­der: Go to homefi­esta.tunglok.com</p>
    <p>Price: From $6.80 for desserts to $19.80 for braised beef shank and ten­don. The Trea­sure Bowl or pen­cai for 10 per­sons is $268</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>DUMPLINGS FROM DIN TAI FUNG</p>
    <p>Din Tai Fung, the fa­mous xiao long bao chain from Tai­wan, has ex­cel­lent Hand­made Pork & Cab­bage Dumplings ($11 for 12 pieces, above).</p>
    <p>Also known as Bei­jing jiao zi, they boast a thin flour wrap­ping and a gen­er­ous fill­ing of coarsely chopped meat and veg­eta­bles.</p>
    <p>They can be boiled or pan-fried and taste great with a black vine­gar dip.</p>
    <p>The restau­rant also sells frozen buns with fill­ings like sesame ($8 for six) or pork ($8.80 for six).</p>
    <p>How to or­der: Go to or­der.din­tai­fung.com.sg or any of the Din Tai Fung out­lets</p>
    <p>Price: $11 for dumplings and from $8 for buns</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>DUMPLINGS FROM PAR­ADISE DY­NASTY</p>
    <p>Par­adise Dy­nasty, the la mian and xi­ao­long­bao chain by the</p>
    <p>Par­adise Group, sells a range of frozen dumplings and a veg­etable bun.</p>
    <p>I sam­pled the Pork And Prawn Dumpling In Hot Chilli Vinai­grette ($24.80 for 20 pieces, above), which needs to be boiled be­fore mix­ing in a sauce.</p>
    <p>The stuff­ing was juicy, but what im­pressed was the smooth and thin flour skin. It was softer than com­mer­cial brands of frozen dumplings sold in su­per­mar­kets and slid down the throat.</p>
    <p>Other pop­u­lar items on the menu in­clude Pork Dumpling In Hot Chilli Vinai­grette ($18.80) and Veg­etable And Pork Wan­ton ($13.80).</p>
    <p>How to or­der: Go to www.par­adise­dy­nasty.od­dle.me Price: From $13.80 for won­tons to $25.80 for veg­etable buns</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>GYOZA FROM IPPUDO</p>
    <p>Ja­panese ra­men chain Ippudo launched its frozen gyoza last month. Priced at $45.45 for a bag of 30 (above), these are the most ex­pen­sive of the lot. They are the small­est in size too.</p>
    <p>The cook­ing in­struc­tions are easy to fol­low, though it takes skill to know when to scoop the dumplings out of the pan when the base is crisp but not burnt.</p>
    <p>They are filled with minced chicken, which is bland com­pared with pork. So make sure you have a vine­gar dip ready.</p>
    <p>How to or­der: Go to www.ippudo.od­dle.me Price: $45.45 for 30 pieces</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>WON­TON MEE FROM KOUNG’S</p>
    <p>I would never have imag­ined that won­ton noo­dles could come frozen.</p>
    <p>But lo­cal food com­pany Gozen has done it, in col­lab­o­ra­tion with hawker stall Koung’s Wan Tan Mee.</p>
    <p>Gozen is a sub­sidiary of Kalms, known for its chain of gift shops in the 1990s, which has rein­vented it­self by rolling out vend­ing ma­chine meals. It is be­lieved to be the first frozen dish of­fer­ing from a hawker here.</p>
    <p>To com­pare both ver­sions, I tried the fresh dish again at the stall in Sim’s Avenue, where a plate costs $4. The stall, for­merly lo­cated at Gey­lang Lorong 21A, is per­pet­u­ally thronged with queues and has been around since 1964.</p>
    <p>The frozen meal (above), which needs to be heated in a mi­crowave oven, com­pares very well with the orig­i­nal. The noo­dles have a firm and smooth tex­ture, and do not clump to­gether.</p>
    <p>The three won­tons in each frozen pack ac­tu­ally taste bet­ter, with a heav­ier sea­son­ing that I pre­fer to the blander ones at the stall. The skin re­mains soft and slip­pery.</p>
    <p>The frozen char siew is more juicy and suc­cu­lent too, maybe be­cause the meat has been ten­derised and the slices are chunkier.</p>
    <p>The frozen dish only loses out in two aspects – the ac­com­pa­ny­ing caixin veg­etable is hor­ri­bly over­cooked and there is no crispy lard. At the stall, I get to help my­self to the de­lec­ta­ble heart-stop­pers.</p>
    <p>Still, I look for­ward to Gozen’s plans to put the noo­dles in vend­ing ma­chines when the econ­omy fully re­opens in phase three.</p>
    <p>How to or­der: Go to www.gozen.com.sg/shop or What­sApp 9769-4163</p>
    <p>Price: $5.50</p>
