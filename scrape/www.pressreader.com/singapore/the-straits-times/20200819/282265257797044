    <p>LAS VE­GAS • The fight­ing fu­ture of Jon Jones ap­peared to be in doubt fol­low­ing his an­nounce­ment on so­cial me­dia on Mon­day, say­ing he had va­cated the Ul­ti­mate Fight­ing Cham­pi­onship (UFC) light heavy­weight ti­tle fol­low­ing a pub­lic spat over pay with the world’s big­gest mixed mar­tial arts pro­mo­tion.</p>
    <p>Fans were alarmed after “Bones” an­nounced that he could quit as UFC pres­i­dent Dana White re­fused to en­ter­tain a higher purse for his fights, tweet­ing: “Just got off the phone with the UFC, to­day I con­firm I’m va­cat­ing the light heavy­weight cham­pi­onship. It’s of­fi­cially up for grabs.”</p>
    <p>He gave no in­di­ca­tion as to what he planned to do next, say­ing only that “in good faith I will be stay­ing in the (dop­ing) test­ing pool for prob­a­bly the next half year or so.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, the 33-year-old Amer­i­can had an ap­par­ent change of heart later after fur­ther dis­cus­sions, con­firm­ing he would now be fight­ing at heavy­weight for the first time in his 12-year ca­reer.</p>
    <p>“Just had a re­ally pos­i­tive con­ver­sa­tion with UFC. Sounds like there will be ne­go­ti­a­tions for my next fight at heavy­weight,” he tweeted.</p>
    <p>“All good news, the weight gain­ing process be­gins.”</p>
    <p>Jones had hinted he was pre­pared to move up a weight class over the week­end fol­low­ing the block­buster tril­ogy be­tween heavy­weight ti­tle holder Stipe Mio­cic and long-time ri­val Daniel Cormier, who re­tired at 41 after his unan­i­mous loss on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Jones, whose only pro­fes­sional loss in 27 fights came by way of dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tion, has been the dom­i­nant force in the light heavy­weight di­vi­sion for al­most a decade, but bans for dop­ing and is­sues out­side the oc­tagon have tar­nished his oth­er­wise stel­lar fight­ing record.</p>
