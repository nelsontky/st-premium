    <p>Puz­zle­ment turned to won­der when a group of Dutch doc­tors who were car­ry­ing out cancer re­search stum­bled upon a pair of new sali­vary glands.</p>
    <p>It was a feat made pos­si­ble by their cu­rios­ity and new tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>The doc­tors from the Nether­lands Cancer In­sti­tute (NCI) in Am­s­ter­dam were in 2017 study­ing scans from prostate and ure­thral gland cancer pa­tients, which pin­pointed pools of cancer cells in the body. The spe­cialised scans de­tect sali­vary glands as well.</p>
    <p>When they called up the first images of the pa­tients’ head and neck re­gions, they ex­pected to see the three known pairs of sali­vary glands near the ears and jaw light up in or­ange.</p>
    <p>But they were sur­prised to see a pair of cu­ri­ous-look­ing spindly struc­tures smack in the mid­dle of the head glow­ing too. The struc­tures had never been seen be­fore.</p>
    <p>“At first, we thought... it’s not real. Or maybe it was some sort of tis­sue. But it looked a bit like a sali­vary gland, and then we won­dered if it is a sali­vary gland,” said Dr Wouter Vo­gel, a ra­di­a­tion on­col­o­gist at NCI.</p>
    <p>All 100 scans – 99 from men and one from a woman – de­tected the hook-like pair lodged in the area where the nasal cav­ity and throat meet. The av­er­age length of each tis­sue was 4cm.</p>
    <p>“We were con­fused and sur­prised by this find­ing, and we wanted to in­ves­ti­gate this fur­ther to make sure they are in­deed sali­vary glands,” added Dr Vo­gel.</p>
    <p>The doc­tors set aside their orig­i­nal re­search and be­came or­gan Sher­locks. They pored over old anatomy books and manuscript­s, and found that some anatomists have recorded a higher den­sity of mi­cro­scopic cells at the same area the pair of tis­sues is lo­cated, said Dr Matthijs Val­star, a sur­geon at NCI who deals with de­fects and dis­eases af­fect­ing the face and neck.</p>
    <p>Both Dr Vo­gel and Dr Val­star led the re­search team which com­prised mem­bers from NCI and three aca­demic hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>The scan images could pro­vide only so much in­for­ma­tion. They needed to work with real tis­sues.</p>
    <p>The doc­tors ob­tained these from two bod­ies that came to them through a body do­na­tion pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>A closer look un­der the mi­cro­scope and 3D mod­el­ling showed par­al­lels be­tween the tis­sues and known sali­vary glands: mu­cous glands with drain­ing ducts, the pres­ence of en­zymes, glan­du­lar tis­sue and a type of pro­tein found in sali­vary glands.</p>
    <p>Pieces of the puz­zle were com­ing to­gether.</p>
    <p>“We thought there were enough ar­gu­ments to call it a sali­vary gland. But it could also be a col­lec­tion of mi­nor glands that are re­ally dense and clus­tered,” said Dr Val­star.</p>
    <p>On top of the three ma­jor pairs of sali­vary glands, roughly 1,000 mi­nor sali­vary glands are dot­ted through­out the mu­cous mem­branes of the head-neck area.</p>
    <p>“But the im­por­tant thing is (the new sali­vary glands) seem to have a role in lu­bri­cat­ing and moist­en­ing the nasal phar­ynx, the up­per part of the throat,” he added.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers tagged the new glands as part of the sali­vary gland or­gan sys­tem.</p>
    <p>In mid-March last year, the re­searchers went pub­lic with their dis­cov­ery at a head and neck on­col­ogy con­fer­ence in Barcelona.</p>
    <p>The au­di­ence, mostly cancer ex­perts from Europe, were scep­ti­cal at first, but be­came con­vinced as the team piled up the ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>Dr Vo­gel said: “Many in the au­di­ence agreed that they were sali­vary glands, and they de­served a name.”</p>
    <p>The re­searchers called the new tis­sues tubar­ial glands, and pub­lished a pa­per on the dis­cov­ery in sci­en­tific journal Ra­dio­ther­apy And On­col­ogy last month.</p>
    <p>Knowl­edge of the hu­man body has ex­ploded since the 17th cen­tury. So, what are the chances of</p>
    <p>dis­cov­er­ing new or­gans or or­gan parts these days?</p>
    <p>Sci­ence Cen­tre Sin­ga­pore’s chief ex­ec­u­tive, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lim Tit Meng, said: “This find­ing shows us that there is much more for us to dis­cover, es­pe­cially in ar­eas we think we are very fa­mil­iar with.”</p>
    <p>He said that while find­ing a new or­gan or body part is rare nowa­days, there are ad­vanced visu­al­i­sa­tion tech­nolo­gies and new trac­ers that al­low sci­en­tists to ex­am­ine finer struc­tures that have es­caped tra­di­tional anatom­i­cal stud­ies.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, the tubar­ial glands had nowhere to hide ow­ing to bet­ter imag­ing tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>The spe­cialised scan the doc­tors used was de­vel­oped only about five years ago. The prostate-spe­cific mem­brane anti­gen (PSMA) PET-CT scan is more sen­si­tive com­pared with stan­dard ones such as PET, CT and MRI.</p>
    <p>“Those scans (PET and MRI) look at tis­sues and anatomy, but not at in­di­vid­ual cells. But the PSMA PET-CT can de­tect a smaller vol­ume of tis­sue, and it can also de­tect more dif­fi­cult lo­ca­tions with com­plex anatomy,” said Dr Vo­gel.</p>
    <p>Dr Val­star added: “This par­tic­u­lar gland struc­ture is in the mid­dle of the head. It’s not easy to ac­cess, and it is re­ally thin. If some­body has a tu­mour there, it’s re­ally hid­den.”</p>
    <p>The doc­tors see the new body part as some­thing else to in­ves­ti­gate as they de­ter­mine how the glands af­fect pa­tients’ health and cancer treat­ment.</p>
    <p>Sali­vary glands get dam­aged by ra­dio­ther­apy, a cancer treat­ment where beams of ra­di­a­tion pierce through the body to kill cancer cells and shrink tu­mours.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients with head and neck-re­lated can­cers who un­dergo ra­dio­ther­apy suf­fer side ef­fects such as dry mouth, dif­fi­culty swal­low­ing and tast­ing, and even speak­ing – al­though doc­tors spare the glands from high lev­els of ra­di­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The Dutch re­searchers said the new sali­vary glands could ex­plain why pa­tients con­tinue to get those side ef­fects de­spite pre­cau­tions. The over­looked glands were never shielded from the toxic rays be­fore.</p>
    <p>But re­searchers and on­col­o­gists in Sin­ga­pore agreed that the tubar­ial glands must be fur­ther stud­ied be­fore ra­dio­ther­apy pro­to­cols are changed.</p>
    <p>Dr Natascha Putri, a con­sul­tant from the di­vi­sion of surgery and sur­gi­cal on­col­ogy at Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>Gen­eral Hospi­tal and the Na­tional Cancer Cen­tre Sin­ga­pore (NCCS), said: “The ex­act phys­i­o­log­i­cal func­tions of the tubar­ial glands have not yet been fully as­cer­tained, and the ex­tent of their role in lu­bri­cat­ing the phar­ynx rel­a­tive to all the other ma­jor and mi­nor sali­vary glands still mer­its fur­ther study.”</p>
    <p>Dr Ki­at­tisa Som­mat, a con­sul­tant from NCCS’ di­vi­sion of ra­di­a­tion on­col­ogy, said spar­ing the glands is not pos­si­ble in pa­tients who have cancer in the same area or near the area.</p>
    <p>Dr Val­star said in­de­pen­dent stud­ies in other in­sti­tu­tions are needed to prove how much ra­dio­ther­apy af­fects the new glands.</p>
    <p>The doc­tors are now do­ing lab work to find out more about the new bag of saliva – from the type of mu­cus it se­cretes to what pro­teins it is made of.</p>
    <p>Dr Val­star said that be­yond ra­dio­ther­apy, the dis­cov­ery could shed new light on other health is­sues such as au­toim­mune dis­eases that in­flame the glands. “This (dis­cov­ery) is a start­ing point for a new vi­sion and re­search in this area. It’s not an end point.”</p>
