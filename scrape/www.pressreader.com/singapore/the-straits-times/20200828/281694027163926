    <p>In the next 10 years, 55,000 jobs are ex­pected to be cre­ated as Sin­ga­pore pur­sues sus­tain­able devel­op­ment, in­clud­ing about 4,000 in the next year, said Min­is­ter for Sustainabi­lity and the En­vi­ron­ment Grace Fu yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Skilled jobs will be cre­ated in the high-tech agri­cul­ture and aqua­cul­ture in­dus­try, she said, as Sin­ga­pore looks to lo­cal pro­duc­tion to in­crease its food se­cu­rity in the face of global food sup­ply shocks.</p>
    <p>And with the Covid-19 pan­demic high­light­ing the ur­gent need to raise pub­lic hy­giene stan­dards, “food safety guardians” will be ap­pointed at food es­tab­lish­ments, she added in the Min­istry of Sustainabi­lity and the En­vi­ron­ment’s (MSE) Ad­den­dum to the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress.</p>
    <p>Ms Fu out­lined th­ese pos­si­ble ar­eas of growth as op­por­tu­ni­ties Sin­ga­pore­ans can ex­ploit from the threats posed by pan­demics, cli­mate change and re­source con­straints.</p>
    <p>Her min­istry will also fo­cus on en­hanc­ing the skill sets of clean­ing and waste man­age­ment pro­fes­sion­als, so that they can take on more spe­cialised roles in dis­in­fec­tion, re­cy­cling or waste treat­ment.</p>
    <p>It will also de­velop a pipe­line of tal­ent to sup­port sustainabi­lity in Sin­ga­pore, by of­fer­ing schol­ar­ships in spec­i­fied ar­eas, such as cli­mate adap­ta­tion and cli­mate science.</p>
    <p>“This will train a work­force that is ready for the sustainabi­lity chal­lenges and op­por­tu­ni­ties of the fu­ture,” said the min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Be­yond de­vel­op­ing the work­force, the Gov­ern­ment will shore up poli­cies in some ar­eas to meet en­vi­ron­men­tal chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude up­grad­ing stan­dards of pub­lic hy­giene, for in­stance, and boost­ing in­fra­struc­ture in oth­ers, like in lo­cal agri­cul­ture, so that Sin­ga­pore’s food sup­ply is not com­pro­mised dur­ing a global food sup­ply shock.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s wa­ter se­cu­rity will also con­tinue to be a priority, Ms Fu said, point­ing to the ex­pan­sion of the Changi Ne­wa­ter plant.</p>
    <p>Ne­wa­ter, or re­cy­cled used wa­ter, is one of Sin­ga­pore’s four na­tional taps, the oth­ers be­ing rain­wa­ter, im­ported wa­ter and de­sali­na­tion.</p>
    <p>She noted that sustainabi­lity has al­ways been part of Sin­ga­pore’s DNA.</p>
    <p>“But we will push for it to be at the heart of our plans, poli­cies and pro­cesses,” she added, say­ing this re­newed com­mit­ment is re­flected in the re­nam­ing of her min­istry, for­merly known as the Min­istry of the En­vi­ron­ment and Wa­ter Re­sources.</p>
    <p>MSE’s immediate priority, amid Covid-19 and the record-break­ing spread of dengue here, is to raise pub­lic hy­giene stan­dards, said Ms Fu.</p>
    <p>The dis­rup­tion of global sup­ply chains dur­ing Covid-19 is a re­minder of the need to safe­guard Sin­ga­pore’s food se­cu­rity, she said.</p>
    <p>Hence, her min­istry will strive to speed up lo­cal food pro­duc­tion in the next six to 24 months, and has launched the “30x30 Ex­press” grant to sup­port agri-food play­ers.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore pro­duces less than 10 per cent of its own food, but plans are un­der way to ramp this up to 30 per cent by 2030.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter said Sin­ga­pore can­not take its eye off the ex­is­ten­tial threat of cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>“We will push for a green recovery from Covid-19, to sup­port a com­pet­i­tive tran­si­tion to a low-car­bon and cli­mate-re­silient fu­ture,” she said.</p>
    <p>“We will pro­mote green growth, ride on op­por­tu­ni­ties from de­car­bon­i­sa­tion and grow green in­dus­tries, such as car­bon ser­vices, and cli­mate science.”</p>
    <p>Ms Fu noted that Sin­ga­pore has in­vested heav­ily in re­search and devel­op­ment on cli­mate science.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the Cli­mate Science Re­search Pro­gramme Of­fice will be set up at the end of this year to drive ef­forts to for­mu­late a na­tional cli­mate science re­search mas­ter­plan.</p>
    <p>She also said her min­istry will do its part to keep Sin­ga­pore at the fore­front of pub­lic health, cli­mate ac­tion and re­source se­cu­rity, with sustainabi­lity at the core.</p>
    <p>“We ask all Sin­ga­pore­ans to work with us to make Sin­ga­pore a green and live­able home and a global cham­pion for sustainabi­lity.”</p>
    <p>A GREEN RECOVERY</p>
    <p>We will push for a green recovery from Covid-19, to sup­port a com­pet­i­tive tran­si­tion to a low-car­bon and cli­mate-re­silient fu­ture... We will pro­mote green growth, ride on op­por­tu­ni­ties from de­car­bon­i­sa­tion and grow green in­dus­tries, such as car­bon ser­vices, and ’’ cli­mate science.</p>
    <p>MS GRACE FU, Min­is­ter for Sustainabi­lity and the En­vi­ron­ment.</p>
