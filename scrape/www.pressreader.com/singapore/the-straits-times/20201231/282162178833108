    <p>Ev­ery busi­ness, big or small, wants to be as­so­ci­ated with sus­tain­able prac­tices and prod­ucts. How­ever, on dig­ging deeper, it is of­ten found that the ac­count­abil­ity is only skin-deep. This is known as green­wash­ing, where busi­nesses con­vey a false im­pres­sion of sell­ing sus­tain­able “eco-friendly” prod­ucts, while chang­ing noth­ing more than the pack­ag­ing.</p>
    <p>Sus­tain­able prod­ucts are of­ten priced higher than reg­u­lar ones. Care­fully crafted mar­ket­ing gim­micks tar­get en­vi­ron­men­tally con­scious cus­tomers who do not mind pay­ing more.</p>
    <p>To avoid such shams, it is im­por­tant for con­sumers to un­der­stand the true mean­ing of sus­tain­abil­ity and sus­tain­able prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Sus­tain­abil­ity broadly stands on three legs, namely, en­vi­ron­men­tal, so­cial and eco­nomic.</p>
    <p>Thus, when we pur­chase a prod­uct la­belled as “sus­tain­able”, we need to be mind­ful of the fol­low­ing:</p>
    <p>• Who man­u­fac­tures the prod­uct? For in­stance, a prod­uct man­u­fac­tured by a small busi­ness that sup­ports ru­ral com­mu­ni­ties by help­ing to el­e­vate peo­ple from ex­treme poverty and re­duc­ing in­equal­i­ties, may be con­sid­ered more sus­tain­able than one man­u­fac­tured by a large en­ter­prise that does not ad­dress these so­cial is­sues.</p>
    <p>By choos­ing the prod­uct man­u­fac­tured by the more so­cially re­spon­si­ble busi­ness, con­sumers can drive other busi­nesses to fol­low suit.</p>
    <p>• What is it made of?</p>
    <p>Is it made from a re­source that is eas­ily grown, such as bam­boo, or from a waste prod­uct such as bagasse or dis­carded clothes?</p>
    <p>If a prod­uct utilises non-re­new­able re­sources or if its man­u­fac­tur­ing causes mas­sive pol­lu­tion, then it can­not be con­sid­ered a sus­tain­able prod­uct.</p>
    <p>• Where does it come from? Know­ing the jour­ney of the prod­uct is im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>A prod­uct man­u­fac­tured sus­tain­ably, but shipped from thou­sands of kilo­me­tres away, might not be the most sus­tain­able op­tion.</p>
    <p>In com­par­i­son, a prod­uct man­u­fac­tured closer to you will have a lower car­bon foot­print, as the amount of fuel utilised and green­house gases gen­er­ated are re­duced.</p>
    <p>• How much does the prod­uct con­trib­ute to waste gen­er­a­tion? An­other im­por­tant as­pect is if the prod­ucts form a part of a cir­cu­lar econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Un­less a prod­uct can be reused, re­cy­cled, re­pur­posed or re­duced, it is not truly sus­tain­able.</p>
    <p>There­fore, the next time you pick up a prod­uct, don’t just go by the pack­ag­ing.</p>
    <p>Look for more de­tails pro­vided on the la­bels and for re­li­able third-party cer­ti­fi­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Oth­er­wise, the only thing that will be sus­tained is the busi­ness’ bank bal­ance.</p>
