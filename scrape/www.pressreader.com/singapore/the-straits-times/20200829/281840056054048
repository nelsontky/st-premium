    <p>• Ja­pan will lift a re-en­try ban on for­eign­ers from next month, Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe said yes­ter­day, as the coun­try looks to re­build an econ­omy hit by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“From Sept 1, we will al­low for­eign­ers with proper visas to re-en­ter af­ter leav­ing the coun­try, on con­di­tion that they take ad­di­tional mea­sures to pre­vent in­fec­tion,” Mr Abe said.</p>
    <p>The pol­icy will “al­low those who are cur­rently in coun­tries on which Ja­pan has im­posed an en­try ban to re-en­ter”, he added.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan has faced crit­i­cism for a strict Covid-19 bor­der con­trol pol­icy that has kept out most non-cit­i­zens, in­clud­ing those with long-term res­i­dency.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe said the loos­en­ing of the rules would be im­ple­mented along­side mea­sures to keep the virus at bay. The an­nounce­ment came hours be­fore news of Mr Abe’s plan to re­sign over health is­sues.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan has been hit less hard than most ad­vanced economies by the pan­demic, with just over 65,000 cases and around 1,200 deaths.</p>
