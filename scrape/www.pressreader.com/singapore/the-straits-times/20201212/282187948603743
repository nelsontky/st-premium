    <p>The Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Ar­bi­tra­tion Cen­tre (SIAC) opened a rep­re­sen­ta­tive of­fice for the Amer­i­cas in New York last week, with a record-break­ing an­nounce­ment that its caseload this year had crossed the 1,000 mark.</p>
    <p>It reg­is­tered 1,005 cases for the first 10 months of this year, which was more than dou­ble the an­nual caseload of over 400 in each of the last few years.</p>
    <p>The new of­fice, its fifth out­side Sin­ga­pore, will also fur­ther bol­ster its rep­u­ta­tion as an in­ter­na­tional ar­bi­tra­tion in­sti­tu­tion that will have a global reach, lawyers told The Straits Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Law and Home Affairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam said as much at the vir­tual launch of the New York of­fice, not­ing that among the big­gest users of the SIAC are par­ties from the United States. The largest num­ber of cases in 2018 came from US par­ties, he said, point­ing out that they have con­sis­tently been one of SIAC’s top 10 for­eign users in the last five years.</p>
    <p>“It has been SIAC’s in­ten­tion for some time to open an of­fice in the US. There is sig­nif­i­cant de­mand, as seen from the caseload break­down since 2014.”</p>
    <p>He also said that “in this part of the world, ar­bi­tra­tion has be­come an ex­tremely im­por­tant means of re­solv­ing dis­putes which may arise from in­vest­ments. If you look around Asia, I think most peo­ple would agree SIAC is con­sid­ered the top ar­bi­tral in­sti­tu­tion”.</p>
    <p>SIAC coun­sel Adri­ana Uson will head the New York of­fice, which will serve as a spring­board to foster deeper ties with users in the Amer­i­cas, who will ben­e­fit from real-time ac­cess to SIAC.</p>
    <p>SIAC Court of Ar­bi­tra­tion pres­i­dent Gary Born said the US was picked for the cen­tre’s first of­fice out­side Asia as Amer­i­can users have found SIAC ar­bi­tra­tion con­ducive for re­solv­ing busi­ness dis­putes.</p>
    <p>“This year, more than 500 US par­ties al­ready have ar­bi­trated their dis­putes un­der the SIAC ar­bi­tra­tion rules. We look for­ward to work­ing with our col­leagues in the US and Latin Amer­ica,” he added.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Coun­sel Davin­der Singh, chair­man of the SIAC board of di­rec­tors, said the choice of New York is an ac­knowl­edge­ment that the Amer­i­cas will be shap­ing much of the fu­ture of in­ter­na­tional ar­bi­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>“The open­ing of our New York of­fice is our way of show­ing our many friends and sup­port­ers in the Amer­i­cas that they mat­ter to us,” he added.</p>
    <p>SIAC chief ex­ec­u­tive Lim Seok Hui said that the open­ing of the of­fice cou­pled with the cross­ing of the sym­bolic 1,000-case thresh­old and a record num­ber of US par­ties at SIAC “will firmly mo­ti­vate us to do bet­ter”.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try play­ers say the New York of­fice un­der­scored SIAC’s con­tin­u­ing promi­nence as an in­ter­na­tional ar­bi­tra­tion in­sti­tu­tion with a global reach.</p>
    <p>Mr Chou Sean Yu, head of lit­i­ga­tion and dis­pute res­o­lu­tion at WongPart­ner­ship, said: “The New York open­ing is in line with SIAC’s re­mark­able land­mark in record­ing over 1,000 cases this year and po­ten­tially over­tak­ing other premier in­ter­na­tional ar­bi­tra­tion in­sti­tu­tions.”</p>
