    <p>Get­ting Sin­ga­pore’s hawker cul­ture on the Unesco Rep­re­sen­ta­tive List of the In­tan­gi­ble Cul­tural Her­itage of Hu­man­ity was a national feat, and was over­due and wellde­served, said Sin­ga­pore­ans The Straits Times spoke to yes­ter­day, a day af­ter the nom­i­na­tion was ac­cepted by the world body’s in­ter­gov­ern­men­tal com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans spoke of hawker cen­tres’ unique at­mos­phere and food di­ver­sity. “I have spent al­most ev­ery day of my last 10 years eat­ing at hawker cen­tres,” said Ms Kelly Ng, who is in her 50s.</p>
    <p>The for­mer IT worker noted the stalls she loves at the Ghim Moh Food Cen­tre – the chicken rice stall in the cor­ner and the fried chicken seller in the first row. She said that all her years of eat­ing at hawker cen­tres have given her an “ex­quis­ite palate”.</p>
    <p>Her claim is not un­usual in Sin­ga­pore, which prides it­self on its rep­u­ta­tion as a foodie na­tion.</p>
    <p>The hawker cul­ture in­scrip­tion is Sin­ga­pore’s first on the list.</p>
    <p>Grab driver Jef­frey Chua, 60, said food at hawker cen­tres tastes bet­ter than what is served at other food and bev­er­age out­lets.</p>
    <p>“Hawk­ers cook it them­selves and pre­pare the in­gre­di­ents them­selves, un­like (what is) cooked at cen­tral kitchens and dis­trib­uted ev­ery­where,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Kidd Teo, 44, said hawker cen­tres’ unique­ness lies in the am­bi­ence, with no fine din­ing re­stric­tions. “You can sweat, or­der a beer and the peo­ple here are easy-go­ing,” she said.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a walk to thank hawk­ers at the Ghim Moh Food Cen­tre yes­ter­day, Min­is­ter for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Grace Fu em­pha­sised that the cul­tural mile­stone has rel­e­vance to all Sin­ga­pore­ans, what­ever their pro­fes­sion.</p>
    <p>She said it gives “a very young coun­try... some­thing to an­chor our national iden­tity with”.</p>
    <p>“(Hawker cen­tres) didn’t close through­out the pan­demic and pro­vided very es­sen­tial food, nour­ish­ment and also a bit of a so­cial an­chor­ing for Sin­ga­pore­ans,” she said. “I think this in­scrip­tion is a call for all Sin­ga­pore­ans to step for­ward, to help us pro­mote, sus­tain this cul­ture.</p>
    <p>“They can do so by rec­om­mend­ing good food to one an­other (and) to their friends abroad. They can also help us keep the place clean af­ter they have used the place be­cause we do want this place to be one we are proud of.”</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong, who had spo­ken in a pre-recorded video to the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity on Wed­nes­day night af­ter Sin­ga­pore achieved the recog­ni­tion, said that hawker cul­ture should never be taken for granted.</p>
    <p>“Hawker cul­ture is so much more than just about the food. It tells us a bit about the history, the her­itage of the food... It is also a gath­er­ing point for peo­ple from all walks of life,” he said. “I think that is some­thing we should cher­ish. It is a very beau­ti­ful sym­bol of what we are as a coun­try.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ronak Robert, 24, agreed. The civil ser­vant is con­fi­dent Sin­ga­pore­ans will still brave the heat and rain for hawker food, even as more build­ings be­come air-con­di­tioned. “More than an over­seas body recog­nis­ing our hawk­ers, I hope us Sin­ga­pore­ans can have a re­newed sense of ap­pre­ci­a­tion for the craft of our hawk­ers,” he said.</p>
