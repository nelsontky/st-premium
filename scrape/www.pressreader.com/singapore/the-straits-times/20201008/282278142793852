    <p>MI­LAN • Ital­ian Luca Wack­er­mann was forced to with­draw from the Giro d’Italia with mul­ti­ple in­juries fol­low­ing a big crash in Tues­day’s fourth stage caused by a low-fly­ing he­li­copter.</p>
    <p>The crash, which brought down Wack­er­mann and Dutch­man Eti­enne van Em­pel of the Vini ZabuKTM team, hap­pened at the end of the stage when a bar­rier was blown over by the draft from the he­li­copter and struck the two rid­ers.</p>
    <p>A state­ment from the Ital­ian team said Wack­er­mann, 28, had suf­fered a con­cus­sion due to a head in­jury, as well as a bro­ken nose and mul­ti­ple con­tu­sions to the face, chin and right knee.</p>
    <p>He also had mul­ti­ple bruises on his arms and legs and a sus­pected back frac­ture.</p>
    <p>“Wack­er­mann will spend the night in the hos­pi­tal kept un­der ob­ser­va­tion and los­ing that chance to live a dream van­ished be­cause of an episode that could have brought some heav­ier con­se­quences,” added the state­ment.</p>
    <p>Vini Zabu team boss An­gelo Ci­tracca also said that Wak­er­mann “was barely con­scious” when he was sent to the hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>“The he­li­copter was fly­ing too low, the move­ment of the air blew up the bar­ri­ers,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, van Em­pel took to so­cial me­dia to con­firm he was fine.</p>
    <p>“I am OK. Only some small cuts on my fin­gers,” he tweeted.</p>
    <p>“Not re­ally sure what hap­pened but out of nowhere, the bar­ri­ers flew into our group. For now, my thoughts are with my team­mate Luca and hope some good news will ar­rive soon.”</p>
    <p>Giro or­gan­is­ers RCS Sport has re­ported that it was caused by a he­li­copter that was be­ing used by Ital­ian state broad­caster RAI.</p>
    <p>“Our del­e­gate is in­ves­ti­gat­ing what hap­pened to­day at the Giro,” stated rid­ers’ group, the CPA.</p>
    <p>“Clearly who­ever caused this se­ri­ous and unac­cept­able ac­ci­dent will have to take re­spon­si­bil­ity.”</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Ineos Gre­nadiers team leader and 2018 Tour de France win­ner Geraint Thomas pulled out of the Giro af­ter suf­fer</p>
    <p>ing a frac­tured pelvis in a crash be­fore the start of the third stage, which was caused when the front wheel of the Welsh­man’s bi­cy­cle hit a feed­ing bot­tle while he was rid­ing at full speed.</p>
    <p>The Giro is one of cy­cling’s Grand Tours along with the Tour de France and Vuelta a Es­pana.</p>
