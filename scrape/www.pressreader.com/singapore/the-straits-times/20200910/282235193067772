    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Forced to stay home when Malaysia de­ployed its army to en­sure strict ad­her­ence to a coro­n­avirus-in­duced lock­down ear­lier this year, Mr Vic­tor Yap sat in his liv­ing room, lis­ten­ing care­fully to a March 27 speech by the na­tion’s Premier.</p>
    <p>As Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin pre­sented the de­tails of the gov­ern­ment’s stim­u­lus pack­age, one thing in par­tic­u­lar caught the at­ten­tion of the 35-year-old prop­erty val­uer from Kuala Lumpur: a six-month mora­to­rium on loan re­pay­ments.</p>
    <p>Re­al­is­ing that the re­lief mea­sure was set to leave him with spare cash, given his two mort­gages, Mr Yap de­cided he would put the funds into shares.</p>
    <p>“At first, I thought the ex­tra cash would barely help me sur­vive these tough times, but then I saw ev­ery­one jump into the stock mar­ket and make big money,” he said by phone. “I also jumped in and did well. It was bet­ter than just sur­viv­ing.”</p>
    <p>Now, with the mora­to­rium set to lapse at the end of this month, the fa­ther of two is among hordes of in­di­vid­ual in­vestors look­ing to drop out of the mar­ket – a move that threat­ens the bench­mark eq­uity in­dex’s re­bound from March lows and could fur­ther sap trad­ing vol­umes, which surged to a record last month.</p>
    <p>“The only way was all in, but now I have to go all out to re­turn to nor­mal life”, and pre­pare to re­sume loan re­pay­ments, Mr Yap said.</p>
    <p>While stim­u­lus mea­sures and stay-home or­ders ow­ing to the virus out­break have seen am­a­teur in­vestors storm eq­uity mar­kets the world over, the re­tail frenzy has been par­tic­u­larly prom­i­nent i n Malaysia.</p>
    <p>The boom in in­vest­ing by new­bies has also been a fac­tor be­hind the me­te­oric rise in shares of glove mak­ers and the re­cent surge in lit­tle-known Malaysian jew­ellers, with sev­eral of these stocks climb­ing more than 400 per cent since the start of the year.</p>
    <p>Mr Yap said he used a part of his spare funds “to ride” the rally in glove mak­ers. Some stocks in this space count among the world’s top per­form­ers this year, and their eye­pop­ping gains have changed the con­tours of the broader Malaysian mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The top three glove mak­ers have added about RM100 bil­lion (S$32.8 bil­lion) in com­bined mar­ket value this year, with Top Glove still the big­gest gainer on the MSCI Asia-Pa­cific In­dex.</p>
    <p>About US$1 (S$1.37) of every US$10 in­vested in Malaysia’s stock mar­ket is a bet on gloves – a feat that makes the South-east Asian na­tion a play on global hy­giene, much like South Korea and Tai­wan are for semi­con­duc­tors.</p>
    <p>“Cash in hand will be re­duced sub­stan­tially the mo­ment the mora­to­rium is over and they have to start pay­ing off their loans,” said Mr Tee Sze Chiah, head of re­tail re­search for Malaysia at May­bank In­vest­ment Bank, re­fer­ring to in­di­vid­ual in­vestors.</p>
    <p>“I hope so, but I don’t think so,” he said, when asked if the rally in Malaysian stocks would sus­tain.</p>
    <p>He ex­pects trad­ing vol­umes – which reached an all-time high of 27.8 bil­lion shares on Aug 11 – to drop in the months ahead.</p>
    <p>That said, Mr Yip Kit Weng, deputy group man­ag­ing di­rec­tor at Af­fin Hwang In­vest­ment Bank – which houses Malaysia’s largest stock­broking house – ex­pects many of the am­a­teur in­vestors to stay in the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“With the mar­ket pro­vid­ing an at­trac­tive and pos­i­tive yield, it will re­main an in­vest­ment choice,” he said.</p>
    <p>But re­cent trends sug­gest that the frenzy in Malaysian stocks is los­ing mo­men­tum, with vol­umes wan­ing sharply over the past few weeks.</p>
    <p>While the bench­mark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI In­dex is still up nearly 23 per cent from its March low, the gauge has fallen more than 7 per cent since reach­ing its 2020 high on July 29. It slid 1.5 per cent amid a broad re­gional sell-off yes­ter­day, more than the 1.3 per cent de­cline seen in the MSCI Asia in­dex.</p>
    <p>Bro­ker­ages are turn­ing cau­tious also be­cause Malaysia’s stock ex­change is pre­par­ing more mea­sures to curb ex­ces­sive spec­u­la­tion on share prices and en­sure or­derly trad­ing fol­low­ing the surge in trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>In­vestors would be bet­ter placed if they hold a high por­tion of cash, as well as div­i­dend stocks and those in the con­sumer sta­ples sec­tor, said Areca Cap­i­tal chief ex­ec­u­tive Danny Wong.</p>
