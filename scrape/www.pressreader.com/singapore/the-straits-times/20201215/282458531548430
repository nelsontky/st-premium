    <p>For seven weeks, Ikhsan Fandi could not find his scor­ing touch as he watched his team slide into the Nor­we­gian sec­ond-tier rel­e­ga­tion dog­fight with a wretched run of just one win in eight games.</p>
    <p>The FK Jerv striker grew so frus­trated that he shaved his head. But the 21-year-old showed up when his side needed him most on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Com­ing off the bench in the sec­ond half against Stjordals-Blink, he un­leashed a 90th-minute left­footed equaliser. The 1-1 draw was enough to avoid his club from en­ter­ing the rel­e­ga­tion play-offs against third-tier Asker.</p>
    <p>Jerv fin­ished the sea­son 11th out of 16 teams with 35 points from 30 games, while Stjordals ended up 14th, two points back.</p>
    <p>Ikhsan, who also struck the post in the game, said: “This is the 20th goal of my club ca­reer and the most im­por­tant one yet. Af­ter the fi­nal whis­tle, we all got quite emo­tional and I cried all out.</p>
    <p>“We were on a good run af­ter I joined, and then we started play­ing the top teams and our re­sults and goals dried up and we started hav­ing injuries and I was cop­ing with a jumper’s knee too. It was tough. I cut my hair be­cause I wasn’t scor­ing and wanted a fresh start.”</p>
    <p>The goal was Ikhsan’s fifth for Jerv – he scored four in his first three starts – since he moved from Rau­foss IL on Oct 5. It is also his 11th league goal in Europe, match­ing his fa­ther Fandi Ah­mad’s tally with Dutch club Gronin­gen from 1983 to 1985.</p>
    <p>In his maiden Euro­pean sea­son, he scored five league goals for Rau­foss in 1,154 min­utes (26 games, 10 starts) and im­proved on his goals-per-minute ra­tio to five for Jerv in 809 min­utes (14 games, nine starts).</p>
    <p>Rau­foss fin­ished sixth to make the pro­mo­tion play­offs but while Ikhsan will not be part of the ac­tion, he hopes for the best for his for­mer club.</p>
    <p>The Singapore in­ter­na­tional, who has eight goals in 18 ap­pear­ances, added: “I’m re­ally happy for the boys be­cause they worked hard to be in this po­si­tion. I have many close friends there like (de­fender) Emil Breivik and I want to see them do well.”</p>
    <p>With the sea­son go­ing on a win­ter break, Ikhsan will fly home to serve the 14-day quar­an­tine and spend time with his fam­ily be­fore re­turn­ing to Jerv next month. “Avoid­ing rel­e­ga­tion is a big weight off my shoul­ders and now I just want to see my fam­ily, re­lax, be­fore com­ing back stronger for next sea­son,” he said.</p>
    <p>Jerv coach Arne Sand­sto is look­ing for­ward to call­ing upon Ikhsan as a key player next sea­son.</p>
    <p>He said: “When he came on yesterday, he was fresh and scored a good goal in the fi­nal min­utes, and we hope he can keep the goals com­ing next sea­son.”</p>
