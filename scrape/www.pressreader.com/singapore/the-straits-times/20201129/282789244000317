    <p>Lewis Hamil­ton in­sisted he is still fo­cused de­spite hav­ing al­ready clinched his sev­enth For­mula One world cham­pi­onship, as he took his 98th ca­reer pole po­si­tion in qual­i­fy­ing for the Bahrain Grand Prix yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>His Mercedes team­mate Valt­teri Bot­tas was along­side him on the front row, while Red Bull’s Max Ver­stap­pen qual­i­fied third.</p>
    <p>The Dutch­man’s team­mate Alex Al­bon was fourth, just over a sec­ond back, in a qual­i­fy­ing ses­sion that saw Fer­rari’s Charles Leclerc and Se­bas­tian Vet­tel fail to make the top 10 places.</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton, who won his sev­enth driv­ers’ ti­tle in Turkey two weeks ago, posted a track record of 1min 27.264sec. “I didn’t re­ally cel­e­brate too much (his sev­enth ti­tle),” said the Bri­ton. “I was train­ing and try­ing to make sure I was ready for this and keep­ing my mind and eye on the ball.</p>
    <p>“This is a con­tin­u­a­tion of what we can do as a team. I just con­tinue to be amazed by my guys who work so hard, week­end in, week­end out.</p>
    <p>“To be out here, in Bahrain, and be able to put a lap like that to­gether – I came today and said ‘Let’s just have fun and en­joy it’. That’s the most im­por­tant thing and, with the pres­sure off, it’s a bit of a re­lease to drive like I did.”</p>
    <p>With two races to go, Hamil­ton could reach a re­mark­able to­tal of 100 pole po­si­tions at the fi­nal race. He is also seek­ing to in­crease his to­tal of wins from 10 to a record-equalling 13 tri­umphs.</p>
    <p>Bot­tas, mean­while, felt that he did the best he could but just could not catch up with Hamil­ton.</p>
    <p>The Finn said: “It felt good. That’s the prob­lem when it feels good and it feels like you are ex­tract­ing the best from the car and the lap time is not there.</p>
    <p>“The last lap there were no mis­takes, only small things here and there – at least there is an­other lock­out for us. I am look­ing for­ward to to­mor­row.”</p>
    <p>Ver­stap­pen was sat­is­fied with third ahead of Al­bon, who yes­ter­day made a re­mark­able re­cov­ery in a car built with a new chas­sis overnight fol­low­ing his heavy crash in sec­ond prac­tice on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“My lap was pretty good,” said Ver­stap­pen. “Just lack­ing a bit of rear grip in the lower speed cor­ners for my lik­ing. But over­all I think it was a de­cent qual­i­fy­ing – let’s see how we go to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>“I def­i­nitely think Mercedes picked up their pace a bit today.”</p>
