    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Gen­eral Mo­tors will re­call 7 mil­lion ve­hi­cles world­wide with po­ten­tially dan­ger­ous Takata air bag in­fla­tors af­ter a US safety agency said on Mon­day that it had re­jected the car­maker’s pe­ti­tion to avoid the call­back.</p>
    <p>The Detroit car­maker es­ti­mated it would cost US$1.2 bil­lion (S$1.6 bil­lion) if it were re­quired to re­place in­fla­tors it had sought to avoid fix­ing. It said it will re­call 7 mil­lion ve­hi­cles world­wide, in­clud­ing 544,000 in Canada.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional High­way Traffic Safety Ad­min­is­tra­tion (NHTSA) said GM must re­call 5.9 mil­lion 2007-2014 model year trucks and SUVs be­cause the in­fla­tors “are at risk of the same type of ex­plo­sion af­ter long-term ex­po­sure to high heat and hu­mid­ity as other re­called Takata in­fla­tors”.</p>
    <p>The com­pany had ar­gued the re­calls were un­nec­es­sary be­cause they did not pose a safety risk. It said on Mon­day it still be­lieved “a re­call of these ve­hi­cles is not war­ranted based on the fac­tual and sci­en­tific record”, but that it would “abide by NHTSA’s de­ci­sion and be­gin tak­ing the nec­es­sary steps”.</p>
    <p>The de­fect, which leads in rare in­stances to air bag in­fla­tors rup­tur­ing and send­ing po­ten­tially deadly metal frag­ments fly­ing, prompted the largest au­to­mo­tive re­call in United States his­tory of more than 63 mil­lion in­fla­tors. World­wide, about 100 mil­lion in­fla­tors by 19 ma­jor car­mak­ers have been re­called. This in­cludes Chevro­let Sub­ur­ban, GMC Sierra and GMC Yukon ve­hi­cles, among oth­ers, built over an eight-year pe­riod.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, 18 US deaths have been re­ported tied to Takata in­fla­tors, though none in­volved GM ve­hi­cles. To date, 15 US deaths have been re­ported in Honda ve­hi­cles, two in Ford Mo­tor ve­hi­cles and one in a BMW since 2009.</p>
    <p>GM ar­gues its 5.9 mil­lion ve­hi­cles are dif­fer­ent from oth­ers with Takata in­fla­tors. It says that 66,894 Takata pas­sen­ger air bag in­fla­tors have de­ployed in its ve­hi­cles un­der re­view with­out a re­ported rup­ture. But Mr Peter Pri­eto, a lawyer rep­re­sent­ing con­sumers in Takata law­suits, said this “proves that GM’s Takata in­fla­tors are nei­ther unique nor spe­cial. GM’s in­fla­tors carry the same risk of ex­plod­ing and se­verely harm­ing ve­hi­cle oc­cu­pants as all other Takata in­fla­tors”.</p>
