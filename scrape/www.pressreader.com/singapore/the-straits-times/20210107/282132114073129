    <p>Fearing that her four cats would spread Covid-19 to her fam­ily, a 45-year-old woman de­cided to aban­don them at the let­ter box area of her hous­ing block in Mar­sil­ing Drive.</p>
    <p>Zariyah, who goes by one name, was fined $4,000 yes­ter­day and dis­qual­i­fied from own­ing any pet an­i­mals for six months, af­ter she was found guilty of in­ten­tion­ally aban­don­ing an­i­mals un­der the An­i­mals and Birds Act.</p>
    <p>The court heard that at about 9pm on March 28 last year, a man was at the void deck of Block 31 Mar­sil­ing Drive when he saw Zariyah re­leas­ing four cats from a cage at the let­ter box area.</p>
    <p>A com­plaint was made to the Na­tional Parks Board.</p>
    <p>Over the course of in­ves­ti­ga­tions, Zariyah ad­mit­ted to keep­ing the cats in her home for some time be­fore March 28. Court doc­u­ments did not state how long she had kept the cats.</p>
    <p>How­ever, due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, she de­cided to aban­don them as she thought her fam­ily might get in­fected with the coro­n­avirus through the cats.</p>
    <p>She took the cats down­stairs and re­leased them. As the cats were me­ow­ing loudly, the man asked Zariyah why she was re­leas­ing them. She said she was not able to take care of the cats, and re­turned home with­out them.</p>
    <p>Two of the cats were adopted by passers-by while the other two were res­cued by the So­ci­ety for the Preven­tion of Cru­elty to An­i­mals.</p>
    <p>Those found guilty of aban­don­ing an an­i­mal with­out a rea­son­able ex­cuse can be fined up to $10,000 and/or jailed for up to 12 months.</p>
    <p>World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion epi­demi­ol­o­gist Maria Van Kerkhove told a news con­fer­ence in April last year that pets are not be­lieved to be play­ing a role in the trans­mis­sion of Covid-19, but they may be able to catch the virus from an in­fected per­son.</p>
