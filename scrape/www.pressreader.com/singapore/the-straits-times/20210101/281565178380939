    <p>The co-chairs of the multi-min­istry task force will de­liver min­is­te­rial state­ments in Par­lia­ment on Mon­day on the Gov­ern­ment’s re­sponse to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong and Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong will ad­dress ques­tions by MPs on var­i­ous as­pects of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Eight MPs have asked about the Covid-19 vac­cine roll-out, ac­cord­ing to the agenda set in the Or­der Pa­per is­sued by the Clerk of Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast GRC) asked for details of the roll­out plans, while Work­ers’ Party (WP) MP He Ting Ru (Sengkang GRC) wanted to know about mea­sures to as­suage con­cerns on the ground about the safety of the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mount­bat­ten) asked about Sin­ga­pore’s na­tional con­tact trac­ing pro­gramme TraceTo­gether.</p>
    <p>Last Mon­day, Sin­ga­pore moved into its third phase of re­open­ing. It be­gan its Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion ex­er­cise two days later.</p>
    <p>MPs also sought up­dates on other is­sues.</p>
    <p>Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPher­son) and WP MP Leon Per­era (Alju­nied GRC) asked about plans to livestream par­lia­men­tary pro­ceed­ings to the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, Min­is­ter for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion S.</p>
    <p>Iswaran said the Gov­ern­ment agreed in prin­ci­ple to live-stream these pro­ceed­ings, and that his min­istry would study the tech­ni­cal and im­ple­men­ta­tion details.</p>
    <p>Five MPs filed ques­tions on the is­sue of about 90 breast cancer pa­tients who may have re­ceived un­nec­es­sary treat­ment since 2012 due to in­ac­cu­rate test re­sults by</p>
    <p>Khoo Teck Puat Hos­pi­tal (KTPH).</p>
    <p>Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong GRC), an on­col­o­gist, asked what is be­ing done to help these pa­tients and what mea­sures are be­ing taken to en­sure the fidelity of lab­o­ra­tory tests. Progress Sin­ga­pore Party Non-Con­stituency MP Hazel Poa wants to know what are the rea­sons for the wrong test re­sults.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health has said it takes a se­ri­ous view of the in­ci­dent and has re­quested that the hos­pi­tal review other lab­o­ra­tory pro­to­cols, beyond those for the af­fected tests, as a safety pre­cau­tion.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to KTPH, side ef­fects from the drug given to the af­fected pa­tients may in­clude di­ar­rhoea, chills and fever. In 3 per cent to 4 per cent of cases, pa­tients may also ex­pe­ri­ence heart prob­lems.</p>
    <p>Four Bills will be de­bated, in­clud­ing the Pay­ment Ser­vices (Amend­ment) Bill, which in­volves strength­en­ing mea­sures that reg­u­late virtual pay­ment ser­vices providers to counter money laun­der­ing and ter­ror­ist fi­nanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Louis Ng (Nee Soon GRC) filed an ad­journ­ment mo­tion on pro­vid­ing more help for those un­der­go­ing in-vitro fer­til­i­sa­tion (IVF) treat­ments.</p>
    <p>In a Facebook post on Wed­nes­day, he said: “I know that go­ing through IVF is an ex­haust­ing, emo­tional and phys­i­cally de­mand­ing jour­ney. It is not easy, and we can and should do more to help those who are try­ing so hard to have kids.”</p>
    <p>Four Bills will be de­bated, in­clud­ing the Pay­ment Ser­vices (Amend­ment) Bill, which in­volves strength­en­ing mea­sures that reg­u­late virtual pay­ment ser­vices providers to counter money laun­der­ing and ter­ror­ist fi­nanc­ing.</p>
