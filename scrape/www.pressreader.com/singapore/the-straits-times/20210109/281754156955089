    <p>SAO PAULO • A coro­n­avirus vac­cine de­vel­oped by China’s Si­no­vac Biotech was 78 per cent ef­fec­tive in a late-stage Brazil­ian trial, with no se­vere Covid-19 cases, re­searchers said, al­though a lack of data de­tails stirred calls for more trans­parency.</p>
    <p>The trial re­sults, closely watched by de­vel­op­ing coun­tries count­ing on the vac­cine to be­gin mass in­oc­u­la­tions to help end a rag­ing pan­demic, came in be­low pre­lim­i­nary find­ings from Turk­ish re­searchers and lacked de­tailed data pro­vided on US and Euro­pean vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Dr Di­mas Co­vas, di­rec­tor of Brazil’s bio­med­i­cal cen­tre Bu­tan­tan, which is Si­no­vac’s re­search and pro­duc­tion part­ner, on Thurs­day said de­tailed re­sults were be­ing sub­mit­ted to health reg­u­la­tor An­visa as part of a re­quest for emer­gency use of the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Dr Cristina Bonorino, who is on the Brazil­ian Im­munol­ogy So­ci­ety’s sci­en­tific com­mit­tee, said a pre­sen­ta­tion at a news con­fer­ence is one thing, but “it’s some­thing else to get the data and an­a­lyse it, which is what An­visa will do”.</p>
    <p>“If it’s what they say, that’s an ex­cel­lent re­sult,” she added.</p>
    <p>Brazil and In­done­sia, which have the most Covid-19 cases in Latin Amer­ica and South-east Asia, re­spec­tively, are pre­par­ing to roll out Si­no­vac’s vac­cine, called Coron­aVac, this month. Tur­key, Chile, Sin­ga­pore, Ukraine and Thai­land have also struck sup­ply deals with Si­no­vac.</p>
    <p>Al­though Coron­aVac’s ef­fi­cacy falls short of the 95 per cent suc­cess rate of vac­cines from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, it is eas­ier to trans­port and can be stored at nor­mal re­frig­er­a­tor tem­per­a­tures.</p>
    <p>The 78 per cent ef­fi­cacy rate is also well above the 50 per cent to 60 per cent bench­mark set by global health au­thor­i­ties for vac­cines in devel­op­ment early in the pan­demic, given the ur­gent need.</p>
    <p>Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech re­leased de­tailed re­sults of their late-stage tri­als last year, be­fore re­ceiv­ing emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tions in the United States and else­where.</p>
    <p>Dr Co­vas told a news con­fer­ence that full Coron­aVac data would be re­leased in an un­spec­i­fied sci­en­tific pub­li­ca­tion, but did not pro­vide a time­line.</p>
    <p>Pressed by jour­nal­ists, Dr Co­vas said there had been 218 Covid-19 cases in the trial of 13,000 vol­un­teers. Just over 160 of those cases oc­curred among par­tic­i­pants who re­ceived a placebo, and the rest were in vac­ci­nated vol­un­teers, he added.</p>
    <p>Un­like other stud­ies of the vac­cine, Brazil’s Coron­aVac trial in­cluded el­derly vol­un­teers, a par­tic­u­larly vul­ner­a­ble pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Dr Co­vas also said Coron­aVac had en­tirely pre­vented se­vere Covid-19 cases among the vac­ci­nated group, in­clud­ing the el­derly. None of those who re­ceived the vac­cine be­came ill enough to re­quire hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion, he said.</p>
    <p>PAR­TIAL DIS­CLO­SURE</p>
    <p>Piece­meal dis­clo­sure of re­sults from global Coron­aVac stud­ies has also led to con­cerns about trans­parency of the tri­als, a sit­u­a­tion not helped by Bu­tan­tan’s news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“It was not clear or trans­par­ent,” said Dr Denise Gar­rett, an epi­demi­ol­o­gist who worked for 23 years at the US Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion. “They pre­sented sec­ondary out­comes on pre­vent</p>
    <p>ing mild cases, se­ri­ous ones and hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions, but not the ef­fi­cacy in pre­vent­ing dis­ease.”</p>
    <p>The par­tial dis­clo­sure by Bu­tan­tan, which had de­layed its an­nounce­ment three times, cit­ing obli­ga­tions to Si­no­vac, added to scep­ti­cism in Brazil about the Chi­nese vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Nearly half of Brazil­ians said they would not take a Covid-19 vac­cine de­vel­oped by China, ac­cord­ing to a poll last month.</p>
    <p>Brazil­ian Pres­i­dent Jair Bol­sonaro has ex­pressed dis­dain for the Si­no­vac vac­cine, cit­ing doubts about its “ori­gin”. He has traded barbs with his po­lit­i­cal ri­val Joao Do­ria, the Gov­er­nor of Sao Paulo. The state is fund­ing tri­als and pro­duc­tion of the shot.</p>
    <p>Still, Health Min­is­ter Ed­uardo Pazuello said on Thurs­day that the fed­eral gov­ern­ment would buy Bu­tan­tan’s full out­put of Coron­aVac this year, near­ing a deal to se­cure 100 mil­lion doses for a na­tional im­mu­ni­sa­tion pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Brazil has the world’s sec­ond­dead­li­est out­break af­ter the US, with a death toll that passed 200,000 on Thurs­day. It aims to vac­ci­nate 51 mil­lion peo­ple, or about one-fourth of its pop­u­la­tion, in the first half of this year.</p>
    <p>Im­mu­ni­sa­tions have not yet be­gun. Mr Do­ria re­it­er­ated that Sao Paulo, the coun­try’s most af­flu­ent and pop­u­lous state, ex­pects to start vac­ci­na­tions on Jan 25.</p>
