    <p>For a sup­pos­edly aloof king, the gre­gar­i­ous dis­play was cer­tainly stun­ning.</p>
    <p>On Oct 23, Thai­land’s King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn, flanked by Queen Suthida, waded through the gath­ered crowds out­side Bangkok’s Grand Palace and stopped in front of kneel­ing fire­brand roy­al­ist Suvit Thongprase­rt.</p>
    <p>The 68-year-old monarch leaned down and whis­pered into the man’s ear. He then pat­ted Mr Suvit’s shoul­der.</p>
    <p>As if on cue, roy­al­ist ral­lies around Thai­land have since gained mo­men­tum, with thou­sands of yel­low-clad sup­port­ers gath­er­ing at key Bangkok land­marks – such as Lumpini Park and Wong­wian Yai – to counter the months-long call by stu­dent-led protesters for monar­chy re­form.</p>
    <p>The largely se­nior crowds have laid bare a gen­er­a­tional di­vide and stirred un­ease about a pos­si­ble con­fronta­tion that could de­rail ef­forts to re­ha­bil­i­tate an econ­omy bat­tered by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ul­tra-roy­al­ists are ris­ing to the fore. Sev­eral are for­mer lead­ers of the street protests that helped pave the way for a 2014 coup staged by then army chief and cur­rent Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chano-cha. To show that Thais want­ing monar­chy re­form are just the mi­nor­ity, they are mo­bil­is­ing sup­port­ers to wear yel­low and gather.</p>
    <p>Mr Suvit, 64, is bet­ter known by his monas­tic name Phra Bud­dha Isara. A monk for many years, he was de­frocked and spent time in jail two years ago over charges re­lat­ing to fake royal seals and as­sault of un­der­cover po­lice of­fi­cers when he was lead­ing the 2014 protests.</p>
    <p>Clad in white in­stead of saf­fron th­ese days, he con­tin­ues to live in the com­pound of Or Noi tem­ple in Nakhon Pathom, where he used to be the ab­bot.</p>
    <p>On Oct 23, Mr Suvit and his dis­ci­ples bussed in some 10,000 sup­port­ers to line the streets out­side the palace, he re­vealed.</p>
    <p>Asked about his ex­change with the King, which was filmed and posted on Face­book, Mr Suvit would say only that the monarch ut­tered “thank you”.</p>
    <p>“The rest, I can­not re­veal,” he told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>Asked how he felt about that en­counter, he paused. “When I was im­pris­oned, His Majesty sent word to me,” he said. “A per­son con­veyed His Majesty’s words to me over the phone.”</p>
    <p>He would not dis­close what was con­veyed. The palace, when con­tacted, de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Suvit was more gar­ru­lous when it came to his opin­ion of the grow­ing stu­dent-led protests that are de­mand­ing that the mil­i­tary­backed Constituti­on be amended, Mr Prayut re­sign and royal spend­ing and power be trimmed. King Va­ji­ra­longkorn, ar­guably the rich­est royal in the world, con­trols two army units even though Thai­land is a con­sti­tu­tional monar­chy.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of young protesters – many of them high-school stu­dents – marched to the Ger­man em­bassy on Mon­day to ask Ber­lin to probe the con­duct of the King, who lives for long stretches in Ger­many as a pri­vate per­son. He is in prin­ci­ple not al­lowed to con­duct pol­i­tics from Ger­man soil.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day night, when his fash­ion-de­signer daugh­ter Princess Siri­van­navari Nari­ratana was due to present her lat­est col­lec­tion, protesters staged their own satir­i­cal run­way show in Bangkok’s Silom Road.</p>
    <p>“Re­form should come from good in­ten­tion but they come with ill in­ten­tion,” Mr Suvit said. The protesters, he al­leged, want to re­duce the King to a mere icon by prevent­ing him from meet­ing the peo­ple or do</p>
    <p>ing work that will ben­e­fit them.</p>
    <p>He al­leged that young protesters are divorced from re­al­ity be­cause they con­sume bi­ased in­for­ma­tion on­line.</p>
    <p>“The ac­tual world con­sists of their par­ents, grand­par­ents, teach­ers and all re­spected per­sons. But to them, th­ese peo­ple are in­signif­i­cant and back­ward. They look down on the older gen­er­a­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ma­li­cious par­ties try­ing to seize power were por­tray­ing Thai cul­ture as an ob­sta­cle to de­vel­op­ment, he added. The youth have been “brain­washed”.</p>
    <p>“Talk­ing to them now is like steer­ing a boat against rapid wa­ter,” he said, adding that it would be bet­ter to step back and let the youth learn by them­selves. In the mean­time,</p>
    <p>he in­tends to or­gan­ise talks across Thai­land to con­vince those yet to be swayed by the protesters to speak out for the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>An­other high-pro­file roy­al­ist mo­bil­is­ing sup­port­ers is for­mer deputy Bangkok gov­er­nor Taya Teep­suwan.</p>
    <p>“I think that is the prob­lem in our coun­try, the gen­er­a­tion gap,” the 48-year-old mother of three told The Sun­day Times on the side­lines of a roy­al­ist gath­er­ing at Lumpini Park on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Like Mr Suvit, she helped to lead the 2014 demon­stra­tions.</p>
    <p>“This young gen­er­a­tion re­ceives news on so­cial me­dia. They were not born, like us, in a time where they saw what the royal fam­ily was do­ing for this coun­try... I hope they have enough rea­son to make their own judg­ment.”</p>
    <p>Ms Taya thinks it is pos­si­ble to have a “civilised” dis­cus­sion about monar­chy re­form with­out re­sort­ing to what she de­scribes as “vi­o­lent” and deroga­tory lan­guage.</p>
    <p>“The man­ner in which they riled peo­ple up in the crowd to make them go against the royal fam­ily was very in­ap­pro­pri­ate,” she said.</p>
    <p>Some oth­ers who joined Tues­day’s roy­al­ist rally were less re­strained, dis­miss­ing the youth­ful protesters as child­ish and declar­ing in­ter-gen­er­a­tional di­a­logue im­pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“It’s like adults ar­gu­ing with kids – the adults can never win. Once the kids cry and throw a tantrum, we have to give in, be­cause we love them at the end of the day,” said 70-year-old Mayuree Trakul­tam­pu­pathum.</p>
    <p>“If you are a child, your first re­spon­si­bil­ity is to study,” she said. “Do they think they have enough knowl­edge, at high-school level?”</p>
    <p>As crowds at the rally waved Thai flags and held pic­tures of the late King Bhu­mi­bol Adulyadej – King Va­ji­ra­longkorn’s fa­ther – over their heads, an an­nouncer said: “If you can’t say ‘Long Live the King’, you are not Thai.”</p>
    <p>Some worry that this kind of bel­liger­ence might spi­ral into more se­ri­ous con­flict as both sides en­trench their po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, a food ven­dor slapped a 15-year-old girl at Ayut­thaya train sta­tion for not stand­ing up when the na­tional an­them was played.</p>
    <p>The woman was fu­ri­ous that the girl was show­ing dis­re­spect, though the girl was later re­ported to be suf­fer­ing from men­strual cramps. Po­lice charged the ven­dor with as­sault.</p>
    <p>The next evening, many stu­dents de­scended upon the same sta­tion and re­mained seated on the train plat­forms dur­ing the na­tional an­them, flash­ing their sig­na­ture three-fin­ger salute against dic­ta­tor­ship.</p>
    <p>Roy­al­ists re­sponded by rais­ing funds to help the ven­dor cover her le­gal costs.</p>
    <p>STAND-OFF</p>
    <p>Talk­ing to them now is like steer­ing a boat against rapid wa­ter.</p>
