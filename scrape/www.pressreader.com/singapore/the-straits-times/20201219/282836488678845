    <p>Get­ting peo­ple to know more about en­vi­ron­men­tal con­ser­va­tion from a young age is at the heart of a new pro­gramme by Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings (SPH) Foundation and its part­ner Terra SG.</p>
    <p>Pre-school­ers aged three to six will get to learn about na­ture in a dig­i­tal jour­ney to Sungei Bu­loh Wet­land Re­serve, and also be taught how to re­pur­pose un­wanted items in a craft work­shop, among other ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The Lit­tle Eco Prints pro­gramme, which is con­ducted vir­tu­ally ow­ing to the Covid-19 pan­demic, has been rolled out to se­lected MY World Pres­chool cen­tres un­der a col­lab­o­ra­tion with the pre-school op­er­a­tor, and is ex­pected to reach more than 1,000 pre-school­ers.</p>
    <p>Dr Lee Boon Yang, chair­man of SPH, said: “Wildlife con­ser­va­tion and en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion are two of the im­por­tant causes that SPH Foundation cham­pi­ons. We be­lieve in rais­ing aware­ness in the next gen­er­a­tion to be eco-con­scious cit­i­zens and ed­u­cat­ing the young on sus­tain­abil­ity through this mean­ing­ful pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>“This will hope­fully cre­ate a rip­ple ef­fect where the chil­dren can ex­tend their knowl­edge to their fam­i­lies and friends.”</p>
    <p>SPH Foundation is the char­ity arm of SPH, which pub­lishes The Straits Times and also has busi­nesses in prop­erty and aged care, while Terra SG is an en­vi­ron­men­tal so­cial en­ter­prise.</p>
    <p>The four-part pro­gramme in­cludes the screen­ing of a video about the Pu­lau Se­makau land­fill’s waste man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive is an out­reach pro­gramme un­der the Na­tional En­gage­ment with Sus­tain­abil­ity part­ner­ship be­tween SPH Foundation and Terra SG, which in­cludes an on­go­ing six-part ex­hi­bi­tion se­ries at the Sus­tain­able Sin­ga­pore Gallery at Ma­rina Bar­rage.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme runs this month at half of MY World’s 42 preschools is­land­wide. It is be­ing in­tro­duced in tan­dem with the pres­chool op­er­a­tor’s pro­gramme on sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>Ms Jane Choy, head of op­er­a­tions at MY World, said the ini­tia­tive aligns with the pre-school op­er­a­tor’s en­vi­ron­men­tal and sus­tain­abil­ity goals. “In our bid to in­cul­cate the val­ues of care and re­spect in our chil­dren, we en­cour­age them to care for the en­vi­ron­ment around us and to re­spect na­ture,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Iryn Gan, whose son Leroy How at­tends MY World @ An­chor­vale Parkview, made a pup­pet with him as part of the pro­gramme. “It is a fun way to teach kids about sus­tain­abil­ity,” she said.</p>
