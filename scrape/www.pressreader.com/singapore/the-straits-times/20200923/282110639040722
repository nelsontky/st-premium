    <p>Na­tional Day cel­e­bra­tions may be over, but some Sin­ga­pore­ans are hold­ing fast to the Na­tional Day Pa­rade (NDP) mes­sage of “To­gether, A Stronger Sin­ga­pore”.</p>
    <p>More than 2,400 re­pur­posed NDP packs have been do­nated to mi­grant work­ers by res­i­dents via the #SG­grat­i­tude­pack cam­paign that be­gan on Na­tional Day.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive was driven by lo­cal com­mu­nity co­op­er­a­tive A Good Space, which brings to­gether in­di­vid­u­als and groups such as char­i­ties, ad­vo­cates and so­cial en­ter­prises for civic en­gage­ment.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­is­ers con­tacted a group of mi­grant work­ers to iden­tify the items they needed while weather­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The list of items, which in­cluded masks, power banks, ket­tles and rice cook­ers, helped to guide donors in their con­tri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>Co-founder of out­door ad­ven­ture so­cial en­ter­prise SerendipET and a mem­ber of the or­gan­is­ing team, Mr Tines An­barasan, 35, saw the ini­tia­tive as an op­por­tu­nity to reach out to the mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>“Many of the mi­grant work­ers we spoke to have come to see Sin­ga­pore as their sec­ond home,” he said.</p>
    <p>“They were unan­i­mous in ex­press­ing how they will cher­ish the grat­i­tude pack as a gift and re­as­sur­ance that they are wel­come here.”</p>
    <p>By Aug 31, the cam­paign had col­lected more than 1,200 packs from the pub­lic. It also re­ceived sup­port from global bio­phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany As­traZeneca, which ral­lied its em­ploy­ees and a group of can­cer sur­vivors un­der their Can­cer Can Give move­ment to put to­gether al­most 1,200 care packs.</p>
    <p>One such vol­un­teer is Mr Ellil Mathiyan Lak­sh­manan, 60, a se­cu­rity agency di­rec­tor. He said he and the other 12 can­cer sur­vivors in his group find per­sonal ful­fil­ment in giv­ing back to so­ci­ety through the ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>“As can­cer sur­vivors, we have all gone through a dif­fi­cult jour­ney and adopt a dif­fer­ent per­spec­tive to­wards life. We em­pathise with the mi­grant work­ers who have been iso­lated for the past few months,” said Mr Mathiyan.</p>
    <p>The care packs were dis­trib­uted to mi­grant work­ers at six lo­ca­tions from early this month.</p>
    <p>For one of the re­cip­i­ents, Mr Mon­dal Md Es­rafil, it was the small items in his pack that bright­ened up his day.</p>
    <p>As the sole bread­win­ner of his fam­ily back in Bangladesh, Mr Es­rafil, 32, who has been in Sin­ga­pore for 10 years and works as a se­nior tech­ni­cian in a lo­cal hos­pi­tal, said: “In the pack, there are items such as soap, sham­poo, tooth­brush and bis­cuits. These are items that I use daily and I feel happy re­ceiv­ing them. In these times, some­times we may not be able to go out­side, so this pack is help­ful to me.”</p>
