    <p>Af­ter fac­ing heavy crit­i­cism for not do­ing enough to stem mis­in­for­ma­tion ahead of the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, YouTube an­nounced last week it would re­move videos that al­leged fraud had changed the out­come of the con­test.</p>
    <p>But half a world away in Myan­mar, which held a gen­eral elec­tion just five days af­ter the US polls and faced a tidal wave of online mis­in­for­ma­tion, in­clud­ing un­founded claims of voter fraud, the new rules do not ap­ply.</p>
    <p>So­cial me­dia re­searchers and civil so­ci­ety groups in Myan­mar say the un­even stan­dard is em­blem­atic of YouTube’s com­par­a­tively hands-off ap­proach to elec­tion mis­in­for­ma­tion glob­ally at a time when ri­val Face­book is tak­ing more ag­gres­sive coun­try-by-coun­try mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“It looks like 2020 might be YouTube’s equiv­a­lent of Face­book’s 2016, hold­ing on to hope that a universal ap­proach might work, even when it’s clear that it’s not go­ing to be the case,” said Ms Eve­lyn Douek, a Har­vard Law School lec­turer who re­searches online speech.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts, in­clud­ing Ms Douek, warn that this is­sue will only es­ca­late for Al­pha­bet’s YouTube in elec­tions world­wide un­til it cre­ates poli­cies that ac­count for its role for po­ten­tially volatile sit­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“With other plat­forms, there’s at least start­ing to be a recog­ni­tion that universal rules just aren’t go­ing to cut it. For the US and Myan­mar elec­tions, Face­book tried to learn from the crit­i­cisms it re­ceived and roll out dis­tinc­tive poli­cies,” Ms Douek told Reuters.</p>
    <p>YouTube did not re­spond to those crit­i­cisms but said it con­sis­tently en­forced its guide­lines and had deleted more than 1.8 mil­lion chan­nels for pol­icy vi­o­la­tions in the third quar­ter of this year, in­clud­ing more than 54,000 for hate speech.</p>
    <p>Face­book, which faced ac­cu­sa­tions that it helped in­cite geno­cide in Myan­mar in 2017, launched an un­usual Myan­mar-only civic mis­in­for­ma­tion pol­icy ahead of the re­cent elec­tion, al­low­ing it to re­move false claims that could lead to voter sup­pres­sion or oth­er­wise dam­age the elec­toral process.</p>
    <p>The tem­po­rary pol­icy, a first for Face­book on elec­tion mis­in­for­ma­tion, fol­lowed pre­vi­ous Sri Lanka-spe­cific mea­sures on curb­ing mis­in­for­ma­tion which could lead to vi­o­lence that were even­tu­ally ex­panded world­wide.</p>
    <p>The com­pany also built part­ner­ships with civil so­ci­ety or­gan­i­sa­tions in Myan­mar, who say the plat­form’s per­for­mance dur­ing the elec­tion, while im­per­fect, im­proved.</p>
    <p>YouTube, by con­trast, chose a light-touch ap­proach and ap­peared to block only false elec­tion claims that peo­ple com­plained about, or if the ma­te­rial vi­o­lated its broader guide­lines on hate speech and ha­rass­ment, re­searchers said.</p>
    <p>“When it comes to hate speech and dis­in­for­ma­tion in Myan­mar, YouTube is the new fron­tier,” said Ms Vic­toire Rio, an ad­viser to the Myan­mar Tech Ac­count­abil­ity Net­work, a con­sor­tium of civil so­ci­ety or­gan­i­sa­tions that study risks on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Ms Rio told Reuters the videoshar­ing site was un­pre­pared and did not make the in­vest­ments needed to mit­i­gate risk in Myan­mar, call­ing for it to do a hu­man rights im­pact as­sess­ment.</p>
    <p>A re­view by Reuters found more than a dozen re­cently cre­ated YouTube chan­nels that pro­moted Myan­mar elec­tion-re­lated mis­in­for­ma­tion while pos­ing ei­ther as news out­lets or po­lit­i­cal pro­grammes. Myan­mar fact-check­ing or­gan­i­sa­tions say hun­dreds of such chan­nels ap­peared this year.</p>
    <p>The chan­nels’ reach var­ied, with pop­u­lar ones ac­cu­mu­lat­ing mil­lions of views, far more than most ac­cred­ited me­dia. A video last month falsely stat­ing the rul­ing party had al­ready picked a new pres­i­dent had more than 350,000 views.</p>
    <p>PROB­LEM­ATIC CON­TENT</p>
    <p>YouTube states in its guide­lines that it re­moves po­lit­i­cal mis­in­for­ma­tion only when it per­tains specif­i­cally to false claims about a vot­ing process, or vi­o­lates other rules.</p>
    <p>“Our com­mu­nity guide­lines pro­hibit spam, scams or other ma­nip­u­lated me­dia, co­or­di­nated in­flu­ence op­er­a­tions, and any con­tent that seeks to in­cite vi­o­lence,” a YouTube spokesman told Reuters.</p>
    <p>She said YouTube had ter­mi­nated a num­ber of chan­nels for vi­o­lat­ing its hate speech and ha­rass­ment poli­cies, but did not com­ment on whether the plat­form had a Myan­mar-lan­guage team or a lo­cal “trusted flag­gers” pro­gramme that al­lows recog­nised groups to flag prob­lem­atic con­tent.</p>
    <p>YouTube has ar­gued i n blog posts that it also re­duces the spread of mis­in­for­ma­tion by push­ing peo­ple to au­thor­i­ta­tive sources.</p>
    <p>But democ­racy ad­vo­cates say that is not enough.</p>
    <p>A re­cent YouTube search for the word “fraud” in the Myan­mar lan­guage re­vealed as the third re­sult a chan­nel full of videos that al­lege, with­out ev­i­dence, that the rul­ing party com­mit­ted fraud i n the Myan­mar elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Other searches for elec­tion-re­lated terms showed other chan­nels con­tain­ing po­lit­i­cal mis­in­for­ma­tion in top re­sults.</p>
    <p>Ms Yata­nar Htun, a di­rec­tor of the Myan­mar ICT for De­vel­op­ment Or­gan­i­sa­tion, which mon­i­tors online hate speech, told Reuters that YouTube videos had been used in fake e-mails to vot­ers that spoofed e-mails from the Myan­mar au­thor­i­ties to al­lege fraud and for­eign in­ter­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>WHAT WON’T WORK</p>
    <p>It looks like 2020 might be YouTube’s equiv­a­lent of Face­book’s 2016, hold­ing on to hope that a universal ap­proach might work, even when it’s clear that it’s not go­ing ’’ to be the case.</p>
    <p>MS EVE­LYN DOUEK, a Har­vard Law School lec­turer who re­searches online speech, on YouTube’s com­par­a­tively hands-off ap­proach to elec­tion mis­in­for­ma­tion glob­ally.</p>
