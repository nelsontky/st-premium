    <p>A con­flu­ence of fac­tors is con­tribut­ing to Sin­ga­pore’s worst dengue out­break.</p>
    <p>A new dom­i­nant strain means fewer Sin­ga­pore­ans are im­mune.</p>
    <p>This co­in­cides with the Covid-19 pan­demic, which saw more peo­ple work­ing from home and thus were more sus­cep­ti­ble to get­ting bit­ten in the day, even as main­te­nance work such as land­scap­ing was re­duced.</p>
    <p>More than 20,000 in­fec­tions have been recorded in less than seven months of this year.</p>
    <p>This is more than the an­nual to­tal in other years – with the ex­cep­tion of 2013, which had a to­tal of 22,170 cases.</p>
    <p>This year’s to­tal will cer­tainly ex­ceed that.</p>
    <p>High in­fec­tion num­bers will re­main for some time as the three months till Oc­to­ber are ideal for mos­qui­toes to breed.</p>
    <p>Dengue is en­demic in Sin­ga­pore, so out­breaks of this mos­quito-borne virus are nei­ther new nor un­ex­pected.</p>
    <p>But the num­ber of cases this year is so high it puts pre­vi­ous out­breaks in the shade. More than 20,000 in­fec­tions have been recorded in less than seven months of this year.</p>
    <p>This is more than the an­nual to­tal in other years – with the ex­cep­tion of 2013, which had 22,170 cases.</p>
    <p>The to­tal this year will cer­tainly ex­ceed that.</p>
    <p>For the first time, Sin­ga­pore is see­ing weekly in­fec­tions top 1,000. Not just a one-off spike, this has been run­ning for seven weeks.</p>
    <p>This trend is likely to con­tinue for some time.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts told The Straits Times that it is due to a con­flu­ence of fac­tors which build on one another.</p>
    <p>Rise of DenV-3</p>
    <p>There are four dengue serotypes.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple who have been in­fected usu­ally gain i mmu­nity to that serotype, but can be in­fected by any of the other three.</p>
    <p>Out­go­ing Trans­port Min­is­ter Khaw Boon Wan was di­ag­nosed with dengue last week – the third time he has been in­fected.</p>
    <p>Of the four, DenV-1 and DenV-2 are more ac­tive here. DenV-2 ac­counted for a high of 77 per cent of in­fec­tions in Jan­uary last year, dwin­dling to 45 per cent by De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>About 14 per cent of 16- to 20-year-olds here have im­mu­nity against this strain.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the less com­mon DenV-3 started its up­ward climb in De­cem­ber, when it in­fected 41 per cent of dengue pa­tients.</p>
    <p>In the first four months of this year, it had over­taken the other serotypes, and ac­counted for 43 per cent to 47 per cent of monthly in­fec­tions. Be­cause it has not been dom­i­nant in the past three decades, fewer peo­ple here are im­mune to it. Any change in dom­i­nant serotype usu­ally re­sults in a spike in cases.</p>
    <p>Among 16- to 20-year-olds, only 2.7 per cent are im­mune to DenV-3, said the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA).</p>
    <p>It said the first four months of the year, when DenV-3 was dom­i­nant, “co­in­cided with an un­usu­ally high num­ber of dengue cases, rang­ing be­tween 300 to 400 cases a week”.</p>
    <p>“This sus­tained high num­ber of dengue cases out­side of the tra­di­tional dengue peak sea­son is likely due to our lower pop­u­la­tion im­mu­nity to DenV-3, which was last dom­i­nant about three decades ago.”</p>
    <p>But DenV-3 ap­pears to be los­ing steam, with 36 per cent of in­fec­tions last month.</p>
    <p>High num­bers in Q1</p>
    <p>The nor­mal pat­tern for dengue in­fec­tions here is for the year to start with fairly low num­bers. Cases grad­u­ally in­crease dur­ing the peak dengue months of May to Oc­to­ber, when the hot wet weather short­ens the mos­quito breed­ing cy­cle.</p>
    <p>But this year, Sin­ga­pore was re­port­ing more than 300 cases a week in Jan­uary. By Fe­bru­ary, the num­ber was top­ping 400 a week.</p>
    <p>This could be due to DenV-3 in­fect­ing more peo­ple than usual.</p>
    <p>The NEA told The Straits Times: “The high base of dengue cases in the first few months of the year means a high ‘vi­ral load’ within the pop­u­la­tion; this is a sit­u­a­tion that is con­ducive for an out­break.”</p>
    <p>The agency said it has also ob­served a rise in the Aedes mos­quito pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>What­ever the rea­son, the usual pat­tern then fol­lowed.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tion num­bers charted in­creased as the warmer months ap­proached – un­til May, when cases went into an acute climb. From April to May alone, there was a 32 per cent spike in dengue cases.</p>
    <p>Covid-19</p>
    <p>The steep in­crease in in­fec­tions was prob­a­bly spurred by Sin­ga­pore’s fight against another vi­ral out­break – Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Cir­cuit breaker mea­sures were in­tro­duced on April 7, re­sult­ing in most peo­ple stay­ing home from work and school and avoid­ing public ar­eas for two months.</p>
    <p>The Aedes ae­gypti mos­quito, which is the main trans­mis­sion mode for the dengue virus, is a day biter. More peo­ple stay­ing home – and away from air-con­di­tioned of­fices and shop­ping malls – gave the mos­quito more op­por­tu­ni­ties for the blood meal the fe­males need in or­der to lay eggs.</p>
    <p>The mos­quito pop­u­la­tion also in­creased as main­te­nance work in con­do­mini­ums, com­mon ar­eas and even schools was re­duced with the cir­cuit breaker mea­sures.</p>
    <p>It was made worse with the Covid-19 out­break in for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries, as the num­ber of peo­ple able to pro­vide such ser­vices was re­duced.</p>
    <p>The NEA said: “Other pos­si­ble fac­tors at play dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod are re­duc­tion in some land­scap­ing works due to man­power short­ages and the ces­sa­tion of the bulk of con­struc­tion ac­tiv­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>Its of­fi­cers found a two-fold in­crease in mos­quito breed­ing at con­struc­tion sites and a five-fold in­crease in homes and com­mon cor­ri­dors in res­i­den­tial ar­eas in the two cir­cuit breaker months com­pared with the two prior months.</p>
    <p>What the fu­ture holds</p>
    <p>Some of the fac­tors caus­ing the sharp spike in cases will re­main over the next few months.</p>
    <p>The three months till Oc­to­ber re­main ideal for mos­qui­toes to breed.</p>
    <p>Many peo­ple are still work­ing from home, giv­ing the fe­male mos­qui­toes bet­ter breed­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>But work at con­struc­tion sites, schools, con­do­mini­ums and com­mon ar­eas in towns has re­sumed.</p>
    <p>This will hope­fully re­duce the num­ber of breed­ing sites and bring down the mos­quito pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Even so, it will take time for the ef­fects to be felt, so high in­fec­tion num­bers will re­main for some time.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, the Aedes ae­gypti is an ur­ban mos­quito, pre­fer­ring to breed in­doors.</p>
    <p>This is why, in the first half of the year, two in three breed­ing sites were found in res­i­dences.</p>
    <p>So the big­ger fight is in peo­ple’s homes and not public spa­ces.</p>
    <p>The only way to quickly bring the num­ber of in­fec­tions down is for peo­ple to en­sure that mos­qui­toes are not given the chance to breed in their homes; and to break the trans­mis­sion chain by pre­vent­ing them­selves from be­ing bit­ten.</p>
    <p>While the so­lu­tion is ob­vi­ous, and has of­ten been re­peated, dengue num­bers are still soar­ing to un­prece­dented highs – a sig­nal that the mes­sage is not get­ting through.</p>
