    <p>Em­ploy­ers who want to pro­vide in­sur­ance cov­er­age for their employees for stress or er­gonomic in­juries sus­tained while work­ing at home now have a new op­tion to do so.</p>
    <p>In­surer Chubb yes­ter­day an­nounced a new Work from Home In­sur­ance pol­icy, which cov­ers risks rang­ing from men­tal health is­sues to trip­ping over toys. The an­nual pre­mium per em­ployee is $38.</p>
    <p>Mr Ben How­ell, deputy head for re­gional ac­ci­dent and health at Chubb in Asia-Pa­cific, said the prod­uct was launched as the firm ex­pects that com­pa­nies will con­tinue to en­cour­age workspace flex­i­bil­ity even as lockdown mea­sures are eas­ing across the re­gion.</p>
    <p>“Although employees have ad­justed well to be­ing dig­i­tally con­nected from home via video­con­fer­enc­ing and other ap­pli­ca­tions, there are emerg­ing risks as a re­sult of this new work ar­range­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>This is be­lieved to be the first pol­icy specif­i­cally for work­ing from home, though other in­sur­ers of­ten cover work­ing from home un­der ex­ist­ing group plans, such as those for per­sonal ac­ci­dents.</p>
    <p>Chubb’s pol­icy pro­vides $2,000 for surgery for pos­tural in­juries or strains re­sult­ing from poor work­sta­tion set-ups, as well as $250 for on-site con­sul­ta­tion and an­other $250 for new fur­ni­ture rec­om­mended by an oc­cu­pa­tional ther­a­pist to im­prove the er­gonomics of the home of­fice.</p>
    <p>A $500 men­tal health pay­ment per em­ployee is avail­able if psy­cho­log­i­cal coun­selling is needed for some­one di­ag­nosed with stress dis­or­ders due to work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>Employees are also cov­ered for ac­ci­den­tal death or to­tal and per­ma­nent dis­abil­ity if they slip and fall at home from haz­ards such as stairs and un­kept toys, or get se­ri­ously burned while cook­ing. They are also cov­ered when work­ing out­side the home or on the move.</p>
    <p>Other in­sur­ers have also en­hanced their cor­po­rate or busi­ness in­sur­ance poli­cies in re­cent months to in­clude ben­e­fits such as free Covid-19 cov­er­age and pre­mium de­fer­rals.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, AIA Sin­ga­pore is of­fer­ing free Covid-19 cov­er­age to cor­po­rate cus­tomers un­til Dec 30 or 30 days af­ter the Dorscon level has gone down to green, whichever is ear­lier. Green, the low­est alert sta­tus, would in­di­cate that the risk of in­fec­tion by the coro­n­avirus is low or the dis­ease is mild.</p>
    <p>As of last Wed­nes­day, more than 320 in­di­vid­ual and cor­po­rate cus­tomers have re­ceived ben­e­fit pay­ments from free Covid-19 cov­er­age, said AIA chief cor­po­rate solutions of­fi­cer Alvin Fu.</p>
    <p>Last month, AXA In­sur­ance said ex­ist­ing and new cus­tomers of its SmartPlan busi­ness in­sur­ance scheme who re­new or en­rol from June 1 to Aug 31 will re­ceive an ad­di­tional month of free in­sur­ance cov­er­age with their an­nual pol­icy.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies could also pay these pre­mi­ums via monthly in­ter­est­free in­stal­ments.</p>
    <p>Pru­den­tial Sin­ga­pore al­lows small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) to de­fer pre­mium pay­ments for group in­sur­ance poli­cies for up to three months, if they ap­ply for the de­fer­ral by Dec 31.</p>
    <p>The firm also of­fers a one-time $500 cash pay­out for employees of cor­po­rate and SME cus­tomers and their im­me­di­ate fam­ily mem­bers who were served quar­an­tine or­ders, and a $200 daily hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion al­lowance for up to three months if they were hos­pi­talised for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>This ap­plied to cases that sur­faced be­tween Jan 23 and June 30.</p>
    <p>Great Eastern’s group in­sur­ance cus­tomers can ap­ply to pay an­nual pre­mi­ums in quar­terly in­stal­ments to ease their cash flow, said man­ag­ing di­rec­tor for gen­eral and group in­sur­ance Jimmy Tong.</p>
    <p>The firm also rolled out an in­sur­ance plan for self-em­ployed, free­lance and gig econ­omy work­ers last month in a tie-up with tele­health start-up Doc­tor Any­where. The an­nual re­new­able Great Com­pre­hen­sive Care plan cov­ers hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion in­come, per­sonal ac­ci­dent cov­er­age and out­pa­tient care.</p>
    <p>Tokio Marine Life In­sur­ance Sin­ga­pore chief mar­ket­ing of­fi­cer Gil­bert Pak said cor­po­rate clients can ap­ply to pay pre­mi­ums by in­stal­ments, sub­ject to ap­proval on a case-by-case ba­sis. The firm is work­ing to en­hance pa­per­less pro­cesses, such as for claims sub­mis­sion, new sign-ups and re­newals, to sup­port re­mote work­ing.</p>
    <p>Checks with five in­sur­ers showed that de­spite the risks of Covid-19, there has not been an in­crease in firms tak­ing up cor­po­rate in­sur­ance plans, though Great Eastern’s Mr Tong said there has been more in­ter­est in such plans.</p>
    <p>AXA Sin­ga­pore man­ag­ing di­rec­tor for com­mer­cial lines Kevin Leong said: “In­sur­ance is even more rel­e­vant and crit­i­cal in times such as this, where com­pa­nies are es­pe­cially vul­ner­a­ble to many risks. The pur­pose of in­sur­ance is to en­sure busi­ness sus­tain­abil­ity in the worst-case sce­nario.”</p>
