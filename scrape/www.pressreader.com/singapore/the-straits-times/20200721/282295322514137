    <p>As Lewis Hamil­ton scored the 86th grand prix vic­tory of his ca­reer on Sun­day, bring­ing him within five of equalling Michael Schu­macher’s tally, the Ger­man’s old team were hu­mil­i­ated yet again as Hamil­ton’s Mercedes lapped the Fer­raris of Se­bas­tian Vet­tel and Charles Le­clerc.</p>
    <p>Last year, the red cars were strong con­tenders for pole po­si­tion and vic­tory, and Mercedes and Red Bull-Honda found them­selves out­gunned. But not this year. In</p>
    <p>Aus­tria and Styria, they were also woe­fully off the pace, only strong driv­ing and luck help­ing Le­clerc to sec­ond place in the sea­son opener.</p>
    <p>So many things are wrong within the famed Scud­e­ria that it is not sim­ply a case of kick­ing out Vet­tel in favour of ris­ing Span­ish hot­shot Car­los Sainz for 2021.</p>
    <p>Since 2014, F1 cars have a fuel flow me­ter­ing unit to limit fuel con­sump­tion to 100kg per hour. Last year, some teams al­leged that Fer­rari had found a way to ex­ceed this, hy­poth­e­sis­ing that their unit, which mea­sures the flow rate more than 2,000 times per sec­ond and sends mea­sure­ments to the In­ter­na­tional Au­to­mo­bile Fed­er­a­tion, could the­o­ret­i­cally de­liver fuel more rapidly while send­ing out sig­nals that sug­gested that the flow rate was slower.</p>
    <p>Their re­search sug­gested that this might gen­er­ate an­other 50bhp at cer­tain mo­ments, help­ing the cars ac­cel­er­ate more rapidly and thus reach top speed more quickly and thus gain time on the straights.</p>
    <p>The key mo­ment came in Austin, Texas af­ter the FIA had is­sued a tech­ni­cal di­rec­tive giv­ing de­tails of a sys­tem sim­i­lar to the one de­scribed, that Red Bull had pro­posed. The FIA said it would clearly be il­le­gal.</p>
    <p>Red Bull knew this in ad­vance so it was clear that the pur­pose of the re­quest was to get a rul­ing from the FIA not for a sys­tem that the team were ever plan­ning to use, but rather one that they be­lieved Fer­rari could be us­ing.</p>
    <p>Co­in­ci­den­tally, Fer­rari’s per­for­mance tailed off soon af­ter the di­rec­tive came out.</p>
    <p>Then in Abu Dhabi, Le­clerc’s car was found to have a fuel ir­reg­u­lar­ity.</p>
    <p>Teams have to tell the FIA how much fuel they in­tend to put in each car be­fore a race, and his was found to be car­ry­ing 4.88kg more than the team had de­clared.</p>
    <p>Fer­rari blamed the mea­sur­ing tech­niques, but were fined US$50,000 (S$69,500) and the FIA be­gan an in­ves­ti­ga­tion into their power unit. In­cred­i­ble as it might seem that an in­ter­na­tional fed­er­a­tion would keep the find­ings se­cret, this was what tran­spired as FIA pres­i­dent Jean Todt said the re­sults were kept con­fi­den­tial “in the best in­ter­ests of the sport” de­spite the anger of Mercedes, Honda and Re­nault.</p>
    <p>This caused a rift between Fer­rari’s Mat­tia Binotto and other team prin­ci­pals, par­tic­u­larly Mercedes’ Toto Wolff, whose cars had lost races to the Fer­raris.</p>
    <p>At the same time, Binotto is be­lieved to have made an agree­ment with the FIA and FOM (For­mula One Man­age­ment) for the next Con­corde Agree­ment, when Wolff be­lieved they had been united in push­ing for bet­ter terms.</p>
    <p>Fer­rari are play­ing down the en­gine is­sues and talk­ing up prob­lems with the aero­dy­nam­ics and han­dling of their cars, but they clearly lack the power and straight­line speed they had last year. They have not been found guilty of any in­frac­tion, but nei­ther have they been proved in­no­cent.</p>
    <p>The Ital­ian me­dia are an­gry at Fer­rari’s fall from grace, espe­cially as there is now an en­gine de­vel­op­ment freeze, and the once pop­u­lar Binotto faces rumours that he is about to go the way of his pre­de­ces­sor Mau­r­izio Ar­riv­abene, and that he could be re­placed by An­tonello Coletta, the head of Fer­rari’s GT racing pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>But just like get­ting rid of Vet­tel, sack­ing Binotto would at best be a pal­lia­tive. There is no short-term cure for the cur­rent agony of F1’s best-known team.</p>
    <p>So many things are wrong within the famed Scud­e­ria that it is not sim­ply a case of kick­ing out Vet­tel in favour of ris­ing Span­ish hot­shot Car­los Sainz for 2021.</p>
