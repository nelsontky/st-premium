    <p>WHERE 01-09 Beauty World Cen­tre, 144 Up­per Bukit Timah Road</p>
    <p>OPEN 11.30am to 3pm, 4 to 8.30pm daily TEL 9773-4644</p>
    <p>This hole-in-the-wall eatery on the first floor of Beauty World Cen­tre is in a quirky lo­ca­tion that makes you feel as if you are on a road trip.</p>
    <p>The air-con­di­tion­ing is ef­fi­cient and ser­vice is brisk.</p>
    <p>Co-owner and chef Ji­ra­porn Wat­tana­mon, 33, who hails from Bangkok, learnt to cook Thai noo­dles from her aunt, who owns a beef noo­dle stall in Bangkok.</p>
    <p>The Braised Pork Noo­dle ($7) is hearty and com­fort­ing. The pork bone broth is made daily with 18 herbs and spices, in­clud­ing cin­na­mon, star anise and pan­dan leaves.</p>
    <p>Want to skip carbs? Go for the Braised Pork ($8), which has a sauce made with 18 herbs and spices such as Sichuan pep­per­corns, le­mon­grass and co­rian­der root. The pork belly, cov­ered with fatty bits of suc­cu­lent pork skin, feels in­dul­gent, but not over­whelm­ing. The braise is light-tast­ing and not too salty.</p>
    <p>The Tom Yum Minced Pork Noo­dle Soup ($6) packs heat with­out numb­ing your tongue. The noo­dles come with a soft-boiled egg that adds rich­ness to the broth cooked with chicken bones. Fried gar­lic adds a punchy flavour.</p>
    <p>The Grill Pork Col­lar Salad ($8) has a gar­nish of fresh mint leaves and a spicy, tangy dress­ing. Chef Ji­ra­porn takes pride in the salad dress­ing which con­tains toasted rice pow­der that is pre­pared in­house. Thai gluti­nous rice is toasted in a pan, then ground into a fine pow­der. She makes a new batch ev­ery three days.</p>
    <p>The Red Ruby ($4) seems pricey, but it is a labour-in­ten­sive dish that re­quires peel­ing wa­ter chest­nuts by hand, then cut­ting them into chunky pieces for crunch and tex­ture. The pieces of wa­ter chest­nuts are lightly dipped in tapi­oca starch so they taste more of wa­ter ch­est­nut than starch.</p>
    <p>The only down­side is the eatery got rid of its crushed ice-maker due to space con­straints, and now serves the dessert with ice cubes in­stead.</p>
