    <p>Spy­ing cases in­volv­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans are rare, but Dick­son Yeo’s is not the first to have been un­cov­ered. In 1980, a cypher of­fi­cer work­ing at the Sin­ga­pore Em­bassy in Moscow was jailed for 10 years af­ter he was caught pass­ing se­cret in­for­ma­tion to a Soviet in­tel­li­gence op­er­a­tive.</p>
    <p>Alan Wee Kheng Soon, then 30, was en­snared by a fe­male agent, or “swal­low”, who se­duced and black­mailed him into hand­ing over in­for­ma­tion on how to code and de­code mes­sages be­ing sent be­tween Sin­ga­pore and its em­bassy in Moscow.</p>
    <p>The woman, who told Wee that her name was Luba Lubov Maluba, tele­phoned him at the Moscow apart­ment where he was stay­ing with his wife and their two-year-old daugh­ter. She claimed to be a friend of the apart­ment’s pre­vi­ous ten­ant, also a Sin­ga­porean, and the pair struck up a con­ver­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>They later met at a restau­rant nearby and ended up spend­ing the night to­gether.</p>
    <p>The Soviet agent even­tu­ally re­vealed that she was af­ter the cypher code used to en­crypt mes­sages be­ing sent to and from the Sin­ga­pore Em­bassy. She threat­ened to ex­pose Wee’s af­fair to his wife and also threat­ened to harm his fam­ily if he did not com­ply.</p>
    <p>Wee did not in­form his wife or the am­bas­sador about the in­ci­dent. In­stead, he gave in to the de­mands and started hand­ing de­crypted mes­sages to the woman while con­tin­u­ing to have sex with her on oc­ca­sion. He even­tu­ally gave her the codes she wanted as well.</p>
    <p>Wee was fi­nally caught by Fin­nish po­lice in Helsinki for smug­gling. He at­tempted to stay in Moscow to avoid fac­ing the mu­sic back in Sin­ga­pore, but the Soviet woman de­clined to help him.</p>
    <p>Se­nior District Judge Michael Khoo, who over­saw Wee’s trial, said when pass­ing judg­ment that his acts “un­der­mine and greatly dam­age the se­cu­rity and in­ter­ests of Sin­ga­pore”.</p>
    <p>Wee pleaded guilty and re­ceived the max­i­mum five-year sen­tence for each of the two charges of di­vulging se­cret in­for­ma­tion. The judge or­dered that the sen­tences be served con­sec­u­tively due to the “ut­most grav­ity” of the of­fences.</p>
    <p>The Soviet agent even­tu­ally re­vealed that she was af­ter the cypher code used to en­crypt mes­sages be­ing sent to and from the Sin­ga­pore Em­bassy. She threat­ened to ex­pose Wee’s af­fair to his wife and also threat­ened to harm his fam­ily if he did not com­ply.</p>
