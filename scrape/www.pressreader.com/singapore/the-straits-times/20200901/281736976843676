    <p>Work­ing to­wards a com­mon goal</p>
    <p>Speaker Tan Chuan-Jin, WP chief Pri­tam Singh and Mr Seah Kian Peng (Ma­rine Pa­rade GRC) share a com­mon love for foot­ball, although they sup­port dif­fer­ent teams in the English Premier League.</p>
    <p>Per­haps in­evitably, it pro­vided in­spi­ra­tion for Mr Seah when he spoke of how po­lit­i­cal dis­course and de­bate should take place with­out lead­ing to po­lar­i­sa­tion and di­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing played foot­ball with both of you, I can say that Pri­tam – you’re the best player among the three of us, by far,” Mr Seah said with a grin, draw­ing laugh­ter from the House.</p>
    <p>When they were in the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces, they held dif­fer­ent ranks, Mr Seah noted. Mr Tan held the high rank of bri­gadier-gen­eral while “many ranks be­low that” were Mr Singh, a ma­jor, and Mr Seah, a cap­tain.</p>
    <p>Their com­mon ex­pe­ri­ences and in­ter­ests, de­spite some dif­fer­ences, have a par­al­lel in how MPs of dif­fer­ent po­lit­i­cal stripes can con­tinue to find a com­mon pur­pose and re­main united when dis­cussing is­sues in the House, Mr Seah pointed out.</p>
    <p>“We all have dif­fer­ent vo­ca­tions but in our own ways, we all love our coun­try. And we want to make lives bet­ter for all. So, too, my as­pi­ra­tion for Sin­ga­pore: Our unity must lie in the small things – care for each other, love for the fam­ily, fight­ing for the per­son next to you.”</p>
