    <p>Reg­is­tra­tion for early birds and loyal run­ners of The Straits Times Virtual Run (STVR) closed on Fri­day night, with the or­gan­is­ers re­veal­ing that the re­main­ing slots are sell­ing out fast.</p>
    <p>De­mand for places in the in­au­gu­ral edi­tion has been over­whelm­ing and run­ners are urged to sign up be­fore all slots are snapped up.</p>
    <p>The early bird and loyal run­ner reg­is­tra­tion pe­riod saw over 10,000 slots be­ing taken up in less than three weeks.</p>
    <p>The main ST Run has, over the last few years, at­tracted a steady par­tic­i­pa­tion rate of over 13,000 a year.</p>
    <p>ST sports editor and STVR or­gan­is­ing chair­man Lee Yulin said: “We are de­lighted with the keen re­sponse that the first ST Virtual Run has re­ceived from the run­ning com­mu­nity and we are grate­ful for their sup­port.</p>
    <p>“There are lim­ited slots left and we ex­pect th­ese to be taken up very soon, so run­ners are en­cour­aged to sign up quickly.”</p>
    <p>To re­ward par­tic­i­pants for their sup­port, all lo­cal en­tries – de­fined as those re­sid­ing in Sin­ga­pore – will be el­i­gi­ble to en­ter lucky draws and social me­dia con­tests for a va­ri­ety of prizes and give­aways from the event’s main spon­sors.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude the grand prize of a Pana­sonic 55-inch 4K Ul­tra HD OLED TV set worth $3,699, New Bal­ance Fu­el­Cell Prism shoes val­ued at over $180 and 100Plus ham­pers worth $100.</p>
    <p>To com­mem­o­rate the paper’s 175th an­niver­sary this year, two dis­tances are of­fered for the STVR – 17.5km ($22) and 175km ($27). The race pe­riod for the 17.5km run is Oct 9 to 18, while the 175km run is from Oct 19 to Dec 17.</p>
    <p>Run­ners can record their dis­tances over sev­eral ses­sions.</p>
    <p>Race fin­ish­ers will re­ceive a New Bal­ance “NB Dry” T-shirt worth $49, de­signed by ST as­sis­tant art editor Lee Chee Chew, and a medal which can com­plete the three­piece keep­sake in­tro­duced by the ST Run last year.</p>
    <p>Those in­ter­ested can sign up at the ST Run web­site, while the full terms and con­di­tions for the STVR’s var­i­ous give­aways and lucky draws can also be found at www.strait­stimes­run.com</p>
