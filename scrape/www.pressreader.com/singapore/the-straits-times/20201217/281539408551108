    <p>More peo­ple rented con­do­minium units and Hous­ing Board flats last month, even with bor­der re­stric­tions still in place. The rental vol­ume for con­do­mini­ums rose 3.8 per cent month on month to an es­ti­mated 4,443 units from 4,281 units in Oc­to­ber, ac­cord­ing to data re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>More peo­ple rented con­do­minium units and Hous­ing Board (HDB) flats last month, even with bor­der re­stric­tions still in place.</p>
    <p>The rental vol­ume for con­do­mini­ums rose 3.8 per cent month on month to an es­ti­mated 4,443 units from 4,281 units in Oc­to­ber, ac­cord­ing to flash data from real es­tate por­tal SRX Prop­erty re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Year on year, pri­vate leas­ings were 1.1 per cent higher than in Novem­ber last year, be­fore the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>HDB rental vol­ume – a re­flec­tion of units suc­cess­fully rented out – climbed 6.7 per cent month on month to an es­ti­mated 1,762 flats last month, com­pared with 1,652 flats in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>How­ever, on a year-on-year ba­sis, HDB leas­ings are down by 11.7 per cent from Novem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>ERA Realty’s head of re­search and con­sul­tancy Ni­cholas Mak said that while the month-on­month in­crease in leas­ing vol­ume “may ap­pear sur­pris­ing” as for­eign­ers are a ma­jor source of res­i­den­tial leas­ing de­mand, a group of new ten­ants could be newly mar­ried young cou­ples.</p>
    <p>“These young fam­i­lies could wish to live in­de­pen­dently while wait­ing for their per­ma­nent new homes, such as HDB flats or ex­ec­u­tive con­do­mini­ums, to be com­pleted, and may rent HDB flats or pri­vate con­do­mini­ums (in the in­terim),” he said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he noted that the in­crease in leas­ing vol­ume is mar­ginal, with mixed im­pact on rental in­dexes as the HDB rental in­dex re­mained un­changed, while that for pri­vate apart­ments rose just 0.4 per cent month on month.</p>
    <p>Over­all rents for condo units last month edged up 0.5 per cent from the month be­fore, climb­ing for the</p>
    <p>fifth con­sec­u­tive month. Year on year, rents are still down by 0.6 per cent.</p>
    <p>Rents in the rest of cen­tral re­gion in­creased month on month by 1.6 per cent, and in the out­side cen­tral re­gion by 0.2 per cent, while those in the core cen­tral re­gion de­creased by 0.4 per cent.</p>
    <p>Over­all rents for HDB flats last month re­mained un­changed from the month be­fore. But com­pared with a year ago, they are up by 0.8 per cent.</p>
    <p>Rents in ma­ture es­tates de­creased by 0.4 per cent, while those in non-ma­ture es­tates in­creased by 0.6 per cent.</p>
    <p>Four-room, five-room and ex­ec­u­tive flat rents rose by 0.1 per cent,</p>
    <p>0.4 per cent and 0.8 per cent re­spec­tively, while three-room flat rents de­creased by 0.3 per cent.</p>
    <p>Rents are down 13.7 per cent from their peak in Au­gust 2013, ac­cord­ing to the SRX data.</p>
    <p>Mr Mak said he ex­pects the Sin­ga­pore hous­ing mar­ket to get a shot in the arm next year as the Gov­ern­ment rolls out the Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme and grad­u­ally eases bor­der re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>“More for­eign­ers are ex­pected to re­turn to Sin­ga­pore next year, and one of the ben­e­fi­cia­ries will be the res­i­den­tial leas­ing mar­ket,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Chris­tine Sun, head of re­search and con­sul­tancy at OrangeTee & Tie, said one sec­tor that may ramp up em­ploy­ment of for­eign</p>
    <p>pro­fes­sion­als with niche skills is the dig­i­tal fi­nan­cial sec­tor, as the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore re­cently awarded four new dig­i­tal bank li­cences.</p>
    <p>“These highly skilled work­ers, who will prob­a­bly com­mand higher in­comes or hous­ing bud­gets, will likely ben­e­fit the mid­dle to up­per tier of the rental mar­ket, such as pri­vate homes in the lux­ury and city fringe ar­eas,” she said.</p>
    <p>But she fore­casts that amid macroe­co­nomic un­cer­tain­ties, over­all rental vol­ume next year may de­cline by 5 per cent to 8 per cent, and rents may fall up to 4 per cent, as more homes are com­pleted.</p>
