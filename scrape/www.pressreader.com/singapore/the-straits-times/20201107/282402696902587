    <p>If Sin­ga­pore is still suf­fer­ing from the fall­out of the Covid-19 pan­demic in four to five years, will Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong have to re­main longer at the helm, and re­visit his ear­lier in­ten­tion not to lead the rul­ing Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) into the next gen­eral elec­tion?</p>
    <p>This is the ques­tion posed by for­mer se­nior min­is­ter S. Jayaku­mar in his new book, Gov­ern­ing: A Sin­ga­pore Per­spec­tive.</p>
    <p>In it, he wrote that af­ter the on­set of the pan­demic and GE2020, the view that PM Lee should re­main longer at the helm has in­ten­si­fied, de­spite the Prime Min­is­ter stat­ing that he hopes to step down by the time he turns 70, which would be in Fe­bru­ary 2022.</p>
    <p>Much de­pends on how long the Covid-19 cri­sis takes to abate, said</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Jayaku­mar. “Of course, if ‘nor­malcy’ has been re­stored be­fore the next GE, I think the public will sup­port his de­sire to step down as PM.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, if the cri­sis per­sists, I be­lieve many Sin­ga­pore­ans will want him to re­con­sider that as­pect of his time­line as well, and hand over only af­ter Sin­ga­pore has turned the dan­ger­ous cor­ner.”</p>
    <p>Given the un­prece­dented na­ture of the pan­demic, now may not be the right time to talk of lead­er­ship suc­ces­sion, said Prof Jayaku­mar.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is in a “very per­ilous and very dan­ger­ous sit­u­a­tion in our his­tory as a coun­try”, he told re­porters at the Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs on Oct 30 when they in­ter­viewed him about his new book.</p>
    <p>“We’ve had many other crises be­fore, but this is a par­tic­u­larly dif­fi­cult one,” he said. “I don’t think this is the time, re­ally, to talk of suc­ces­sion.”</p>
    <p>In his Fuller­ton elec­tion rally on July 6, PM Lee said he had not ex­pected to en­counter such “an over­whelm­ing cri­sis” in the last stretch of his premier­ship.</p>
    <p>He also said he would see this through with his older col­leagues, such as se­nior min­is­ters Teo Chee Hean and Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam, and the 4G (fourth-gen­er­a­tion) min­is­ters so as to hand over Sin­ga­pore in­tact and in good work­ing or­der to the next team.</p>
    <p>Prof Jayaku­mar wrote i n the book that he is glad PM Lee has given him­self some flex­i­bil­ity in terms of the suc­ces­sion time­line. “In my view, how­ever ca­pa­ble the 4G lead­ers, we should not change horses in mid­stream.”</p>
    <p>When asked if a shift in the time­line would af­fect a smooth tran­si­tion to the 4G lead­er­ship, Prof Jayaku­mar said: “I’ve not spo­ken to the 4G, I do not know their views, but I’m quite sure that they will be guided by the main con­sid­er­a­tion of what is best in Sin­ga­pore’s in­ter­ests. I’m con­fi­dent of that. We’ll have to see how events un­fold.”</p>
    <p>Led by Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat, the 4G lead­ers are the next gen­er­a­tion of min­is­ters who will helm the Gov­ern­ment when PM Lee steps down.</p>
    <p>In the book, Prof Jayaku­mar wrote that the Prime Min­is­ter’s in­di­ca­tion that he will see the Covid-19 cri­sis through gives a valu­able op­por­tu­nity for the younger 4G min­is­ters – and newly elected MPs who were also made of­fice­hold­ers – to learn from PM Lee and the more se­nior min­is­ters.</p>
    <p>He likened this to the way he and his gen­er­a­tion of min­is­ters had learnt from pi­o­neer lead­ers such as Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Mr S. Ra­jarat­nam and Dr Goh Keng Swee.</p>
    <p>He ob­served that the 4G lead­ers have shown a steady hand un­der dif­fi­cult cir­cum­stances. They have been trans­par­ent in set­ting out the facts in their reg­u­lar tele­vi­sion brief­ings, and con­fi­dent in mak­ing and ex­plain­ing de­ci­sions as the coro­n­avirus out­break pro­gressed, he said.</p>
    <p>De­spite crit­i­cisms that they were mis­han­dling the cri­sis ow­ing to an ear­lier spike in in­fec­tion num­bers, the 4G lead­ers have done a “cred­itable job”, he added.</p>
    <p>“I was wor­ried as to whether they would be flus­tered by this crit­i­cism, and was very cheered when</p>
    <p>I saw that they were un­fazed. They went about their tasks in a very de­ter­mined man­ner.”</p>
    <p>A more for­mi­da­ble chal­lenge, he said in his book, is win­ning the hearts and minds of younger Sin­ga­pore­ans. This is be­cause they have needs that are more emo­tional and ex­pe­ri­en­tial, they want their voices heard and they want to play a part.</p>
    <p>He dis­agreed with those who say that the young are “soft”, are by de­fault re­bel­lious and counter-es­tab­lish­ment, and likely to vote against the PAP.</p>
    <p>“I do not think this is nec­es­sar­ily true,” he wrote, adding that if the 4G lead­ers demon­strate good lead­er­ship and the abil­ity to gov­ern well through a cri­sis, the younger gen­er­a­tion would re­spect them and look up to them.</p>
