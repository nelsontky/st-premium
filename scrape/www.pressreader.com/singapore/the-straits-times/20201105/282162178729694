    <p>More should be done to level the play­ing field for de­fence lawyers, so that jus­tice can be fur­thered, said Leader of the Op­po­si­tion Pri­tam Singh in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Among other things, he called for the prose­cu­tion’s duty to the court to dis­close rel­e­vant ma­te­rial not favourable to its case to be cod­i­fied in the Crim­i­nal Procedure Code.</p>
    <p>While the prose­cu­tion’s obli­ga­tion to do so has been set out in case law from a 2011 Court of Ap­peal judg­ment, the prose­cu­tion has not nec­es­sar­ily done so in all cases, said Mr Singh, who cited the re­cent case of Dr Wee Teong Boo, who was cleared of all charges in June after be­ing ac­cused of rap­ing and mo­lest­ing a pa­tient.</p>
    <p>In the judg­ment on Dr Wee’s case, the Court of Ap­peal had ruled that the prose­cu­tion did not make avail­able to the de­fence doc­u­ments that would have es­tab­lished “clear and ma­te­rial in­con­sis­ten­cies” in the prose­cu­tion’s ev­i­dence, Mr Singh noted.</p>
    <p>“Al­most 10 years after (the 2011 Court of Ap­peal judg­ment), it is ap­po­site to ask how deeply the prose­cu­tion’s com­mon law dis­clo­sure obli­ga­tions have been in­ter­nalised in our crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh was speak­ing dur­ing the de­bate on a mo­tion moved by Work­ers’ Party chair­man Sylvia Lim (Alju­nied GRC) on i ssues raised by a court case in­volv­ing Ms Parti Liyani, the for­mer do­mes­tic worker of for­mer Changi Air­port Group and Sur­bana Jurong chair­man Liew Mun Leong.</p>
    <p>“In Ms Parti Liyani’s case, the lack of forthright­ness of t he deputy public prosecutor­s in in­form­ing the trial court about the ser­vice­abil­ity of the DVD player makes a sim­i­lar point about fair­ness in our ad­ver­sar­ial sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“Cru­cially, how­ever, it raised the public’s eye­brows about our pros­e­cu­to­rial cul­ture,” he added.</p>
    <p>While he stressed that cases of non-dis­clo­sure of such in­for­ma­tion by the prose­cu­tion are not syn­ony­mous with the sup­pres­sion of ev­i­dence, rev­e­la­tions of non-dis­clo­sure, like in Dr Wee’s case, risk crys­tallis­ing such a public per­cep­tion.</p>
    <p>The Chief Jus­tice had in Oc­to­ber given the go-ahead for investigat­ions into two deputy public prosecutor­s (DPPs) to com­mence, fol­low­ing a mis­con­duct com­plaint by Ms Parti.</p>
    <p>At the trial, the DPPs showed Ms Parti the ma­chine could play a video stored dig­i­tally in the hard disk. But at the ap­peal, it was shown it could not play DVDs. The Chief Jus­tice had found there was a prima fa­cie case that the DPPs’ con­duct might sug­gest a lack of can­dour on their part.</p>
    <p>While the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral serves as the Gov­ern­ment’s le­gal ad­viser to pro­tect the in­ter­ests of the Gov­ern­ment, as public pros­e­cu­tor, the of­fice also rep­re­sents the public, said Mr Singh.</p>
    <p>“(He) must pros­e­cute with­out fear or favour, even if it means dam­ag­ing the rep­u­ta­tion of the gov­ern­ment of the day, or pros­e­cut­ing min­is­ters or even the prime min­is­ter.”</p>
    <p>This dual role cre­ates a con­flict of in­ter­est, he pointed out.</p>
    <p>To re­move this pos­si­ble con­flict of in­ter­est, the role of gov­ern­ment le­gal ad­viser should be split from the role of public pros­e­cu­tor, with nei­ther role sub­or­di­nate to the other, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Den­nis Tan (Hougang) also pro­posed hav­ing a sep­a­rate ded­i­cated ju­di­cial ser­vice in the State Courts.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, he noted, the Le­gal Ser­vice Com­mis­sion chooses le­gal of­fi­cers who may be posted from the min­istries or the At­tor­ney­Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC) into the State Court ju­di­ciary, and then out again.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing a sep­a­rate ju­di­cial ser­vice would avoid a sit­u­a­tion where mag­is­trates and judges find them­selves hav­ing col­leagues from the AGC – some with greater se­nior­ity – ar­gu­ing cases be­fore them, while know­ing they may them­selves be posted back to the AGC in the fu­ture, he said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Leon Per­era (Alju­nied GRC) called for an om­buds­man to be set up, given the ques­tions of wider ac­cess to crim­i­nal jus­tice and av­enues of re­dress for those with lesser means aris­ing from Ms Parti’s case.</p>
    <p>He said such an om­buds­man will func­tion as an in­de­pen­dent of­fice open to Sin­ga­pore­ans of all back­grounds and in­come lev­els to in­ves­ti­gate complaints about un­fair ad­min­is­tra­tive de­ci­sions or ac­tions of a public agency.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Law Ed­win Tong pointed out that om­buds­men in other coun­tries have their fail­ings, and that Sin­ga­pore has al­ready many of such ex­ter­nal re­view pan­els set up, though he agreed with Mr Per­era that there is room to bet­ter the jus­tice sys­tem.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to Mr Singh, Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam agreed that it is un­sat­is­fac­tory to let the prose­cu­tion’s dis­clo­sure re­quire­ments re­main a com­mon law prin­ci­ple.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment is look­ing at set­ting out these dis­clo­sure re­quire­ments in statute, and it has been hav­ing in­ter­nal dis­cus­sions on this since early this year, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam also re­it­er­ated to Mr Tan his point made ear­lier that all move­ments in the le­gal ser­vice are over­seen by per­son­nel boards or com­mit­tees, which are chaired by the Chief Jus­tice and Le­gal Ser­vice Com­mis­sion, of which the Chief Jus­tice is pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>He had also ear­lier ex­plained that the Le­gal Ser­vice Com­mis­sion be­lieves that ro­ta­tion pro­vides ac­cess to a larger pool of tal­ent and helps its of­fi­cers be­come more well-rounded, among other things.</p>
