    <p>Ri­val protest groups ral­lied in and around Bangkok yes­ter­day, rais­ing fears of a re­turn to street vi­o­lence af­ter al­most daily anti-gov­ern­ment demon­stra­tions across Thai­land.</p>
    <p>BANGKOK • Ri­val protest groups ral­lied in and around the Thai cap­i­tal yes­ter­day, rais­ing the po­lit­i­cal tem­per­a­ture amid al­most daily antigov­ern­ment stu­dent protests na­tion­wide and stir­ring fears of a re­turn to street vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>Thai­land was roiled for more than a decade by spo­radic street clashes be­tween con­ser­va­tives and those loyal to former pop­ulist prime min­is­ter Thaksin Shi­nawa­tra. There have been two mil­i­tary coups in the past 15 years, the last led by cur­rent Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha in 2014.</p>
    <p>Dozens of sup­port­ers ral­lied in front of Par­lia­ment House yes­ter­day in sup­port of Mr Prayut’s gov­ern­ment. Thou­sands later joined an anti-gov­ern­ment demon­stra­tion at Tham­masat Univer­sity on the out­skirts of Bangkok, the largest such protest by stu­dents, chal­leng­ing the gov­ern­ment and con­ser­va­tive roy­al­ist es­tab­lish­ment.</p>
    <p>In a sign of a more co­or­di­nated opposition to the stu­dents, a former na­tion­al­ist ac­tivist, Mr Sumet Trakul­woon­noo, 46, an­nounced a new pro-gov­ern­ment group, the Co­or­di­na­tion Cen­tre of Vo­ca­tional Stu­dents for the Pro­tec­tion of Na­tional In­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>“A group of peo­ple are in­sti­gat­ing young mi­nors to come out and at­tack the mil­i­tary, the gov­ern­ment and also in­volv­ing the monar­chy, and this could lead to vi­o­lence and de­struc­tion of our sys­tem of gov­er­nance and our cul­ture,” Mr Sumet told re­porters at the rally.</p>
    <p>“We’re set­ting up to re­mind youth groups, par­ents, teach­ers and of­fi­cials about the dan­ger to the na­tion from these peo­ple who are in­sti­gat­ing youth to be­come god­less and ob­sessed with Western cul­ture, do drugs and hate their par­ents and teach­ers.”</p>
    <p>The anti-gov­ern­ment protesters have made a grow­ing num­ber of veiled ref­er­ences to the monar­chy, a highly sen­si­tive topic, and one speaker at a re­cent rally called for its reform.</p>
    <p>The stu­dents ac­cused the pro­gov­ern­ment demon­stra­tors of try­ing to cre­ate con­fronta­tion which could lead to an­other mil­i­tary in­ter­ven­tion. “They staged a coun­ter­protest to­day to cre­ate a con­di­tion that could lead us to an­other coup,” Maha Sarakham Univer­sity stu­dent ac­tivist Nick Thanawit told the crowd yes­ter­day. “We do not want this and will op­pose it.”</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut has said the gov­ern­ment is cre­at­ing a way for po­lit­i­cal groups to ex­press their views but he has voiced con­cern about con­fronta­tion.</p>
    <p>The re­ac­tion from the au­thor­i­ties to the anti-gov­ern­ment protests has been lim­ited but two ac­tivists were ar­rested last Fri­day.</p>
