    <p>To say that Bri­ton Tom Bell is a BMW fan would be an un­der­state­ment.</p>
    <p>The 39-year-old strat­egy head of a min­ing com­pany has owned sev­eral rides from the Ger­man mar­que since he was posted here in 2012. They in­clude a 325i, a 525i and a 335i Con­vert­ible.</p>
    <p>“I quickly found out that the con­vert­ible was not suit­able i n Sin­ga­pore’s hot and hu­mid cli­mate,” he quips.</p>
    <p>He owns two BMWs.</p>
    <p>His daily ride is a BMW 730Li, but he is more smit­ten with his E24, the code name for the first-gen­er­a­tion 635CSi Coupe.</p>
    <p>His 635CSi is a 1980 model im­ported from Bri­tain. It was reg­is­tered un­der the Clas­sic Ve­hi­cle Scheme (CVS), which ap­plies to ve­hi­cles that are at least 35 years old, in 2017 by its first Sin­ga­pore owner, an avid car col­lec­tor.</p>
    <p>“It was an im­pulse buy,” con­fesses Mr Bell, who paid $70,000 for the two-door ride in 2018.</p>
    <p>His first car was not a Beemer, though. It was a Ford Es­cort, which he says had to be reg­u­larly bump­started. “It was not a good car.”</p>
    <p>In Bri­tain, he also drove a Peu­geot 306, Volvo V40, Volk­swa­gen Golf, Audi A3, Volk­swa­gen Pas­sat Vari­ant and Honda Civic.</p>
    <p>It was not un­til he came to Sin­ga­pore that he fell in love with BMW. “I like the BMW driv­ing ex­pe­ri­ence,” he says.</p>
    <p>That and the fact that he found a lo­cal work­shop spe­cial­is­ing i n BMWs, which has kept his cars go­ing with min­i­mum fuss.</p>
    <p>All his BMW cars were pre­owned and out­side of the war­ranty pe­riod, mak­ing a re­li­able work­shop all the more im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>On the two cars he owns and why he prefers the retro 6-se­ries ride to the more mod­ern 7-se­ries, he says with a smile: “To me, the E24 is the best-look­ing BMW ever re­leased. It’s also of sim­i­lar vin­tage as me.</p>
    <p>“From the sound of the straight­six engine to the en­gag­ing way it drives, ev­ery­thing about it is ana­logue. The only thing dig­i­tal is the clock.”</p>
    <p>His wife Isobel and two daugh­ters aged five and seven are less en­thu­si­as­tic about his clas­sic car, pre­fer­ring the mod­ern com­forts of the 7-se­ries.</p>
    <p>Un­der the CVS, Mr Bell’s E24 can be driven for up to 45 days a year.</p>
    <p>“It has a low-stress life and usu­ally serves one of three pur­poses – a quick trip to the shops, morn­ing cof­fee meet-ups or a short drive to Sen­tosa for fish­ing,” he says.</p>
    <p>He adds that his car of­ten gets the thumbs-up from other driv­ers and is a con­ver­sa­tion starter.</p>
    <p>“The road is a much friend­lier place in a clas­sic car,” he says.</p>
    <p>“It’s great when the sun is out, the mu­sic is on, with the win­dows down. It is a fine place to sit in.”</p>
    <p>Hav­ing ac­quired a taste for clas­sic sports cars, he is keep­ing an eye out for a BMW 3.0CS, as well as a Lo­tus Esprit, a Bri­tish car.</p>
    <p>But he ad­mits that find­ing one in good con­di­tion and at an af­ford­able price re­mains a chal­lenge. “Older col­lectibles ap­pear to hold their value well,” he says.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the BMW 635CSi re­mains his pride and joy.</p>
    <p>What’s in the boot?</p>
    <p>• Two fish­ing rods • Bag with fish­ing gear • Two um­brel­las</p>
