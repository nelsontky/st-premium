    <p>NEW YORK • When Ms Meera Parat de­cided to leave her onebed­room flat in Seat­tle and re­turn to her child­hood home in Palo Alto, Cal­i­for­nia, she fig­ured she would be stay­ing for a few weeks.</p>
    <p>Three months later, Ms Parat, 25, a data sci­en­tist, was still tak­ing video calls from her child­hood bed­room, which is dec­o­rated with ele­men­tary school tro­phies and notes with in­side jokes.</p>
    <p>“It’s prob­a­bly ex­actly the same from when I left it in high school,” she said.</p>
    <p>A re­cent Pew Re­search Cen­tre sur­vey found that roughly 20 per cent of Amer­i­can adults moved, or know some­one who re­lo­cated per­ma­nently or tem­po­rar­ily, be­cause of the pan­demic. The study found that higher in­come and ed­u­ca­tion played a role in who was able to move.</p>
    <p>Some moved to re­duce their risk of con­tract­ing the virus. Oth­ers, be­cause of fi­nan­cial in­sta­bil­ity or a fear of be­ing in quar­an­tine alone. Many left cities and re­turned to their smaller home towns.</p>
    <p>Stay­ing with their fam­i­lies, many slept and worked in the rooms where they grew up, de­scrib­ing an ex­pe­ri­ence that felt like vis­it­ing a mu­seum filled with relics of their past selves.</p>
    <p>Ms Chi­na­zor Of­for, 25, who works i n e-com­merce at Bus­tle Dig­i­tal Group, was hes­i­tant at first, but when the pan­demic hit and her work hours were cut in half, she re­alised she could not sus­tain her life in New York.</p>
    <p>She de­cided to move home to Senoia, Ge­or­gia, at the end of April to ride out the rest of her self­im­posed quar­an­tine with her par­ents.</p>
    <p>After be­ing away from New York for nearly two months, Ms Of­for said she found her­self be­ing less dis­tracted by the hus­tle and bus­tle of the city. She started prac­tis­ing reg­u­larly on the gui­tar, which she used to play in high school.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know if I could go back after feel­ing like I can ac­tu­ally pay off debt,” she said. “I can ac­tu­ally save for the first time.”</p>
    <p>Other emo­tions and old teenage angst have resur­faced as peo­ple have been us­ing their time back home – some­times vol­un­tary; some­times not – to go through the boxes, clos­ets and draw­ers con­tain­ing their trea­sures from the past.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing back def­i­nitely brings up a lot of in­se­cu­rity you had as a kid and as a young adult at this house, in par­tic­u­lar,” said Ms De­laney Hues­gen, 21, who grad­u­ated from Kent State Univer­sity in De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>She moved to New York City in Jan­uary and moved back home to Seat­tle a month later when the of­fice of the fash­ion pub­lic re­la­tions firm where she had been in­tern­ing closed.</p>
    <p>“We moved here when I was just start­ing high school so there’s lots of those weird kind of awk­ward feel­ings.”</p>
    <p>For Ms Hues­gen, the de­ci­sion to re­turn home was not ini­tially fi­nan­cial, but stay­ing be­came more about money as time passed.</p>
    <p>“I re­alised that be­ing home and sav­ing money on rent, although I was still pay­ing for my apart­ment in New York till June, was go­ing to be re­ally ben­e­fi­cial in the long run,” she said.</p>
    <p>“It is kind of nice now, though, be­cause I know that any money I make is be­ing saved for when I get back on my feet in the city.”</p>
    <p>While some peo­ple have em­braced the ex­pe­ri­ence of be­ing in the rooms that shaped their for­ma­tive years, oth­ers have been more re­luc­tant.</p>
    <p>Ms Lisa Car­avelli de­scribed her child­hood bed­room as not only un­changed but “worse”.</p>
    <p>“My par­ents took my old room dec­o­ra­tions from when I was a tod­dler, like ev­ery­thing Min­nie Mouse and bub­blegum pink and did the room as if l was four years old again,” said Ms Car­avelli, 26, who works in ad­ver­tis­ing soft­ware sales in Chicago. The Min­nie Mouse re­vival was for her two younger nieces, who oc­ca­sion­ally sleep over.</p>
    <p>“I’m thank­ful for Zoom back­grounds be­cause other­wise, it’s a big bow head­board and polka dots.”</p>
    <p>But more than Dis­ney decor, for many peo­ple, cer­tain mem­o­ries from the past have emerged as un­ex­pected op­por­tu­ni­ties for sel­f­re­flec­tion in terms of how they have changed through­out the years and the ways in which they have stayed the same.</p>
    <p>Although some are itching to get back to pre-pan­demic life, oth­ers like Ms Alex Rose – a 33-year-old pro­ducer on self-im­posed quar­an­tine in Austin, Texas – have de­cided they are not in any rush.</p>
    <p>For her, be­ing back in Austin has led to re­dis­cov­ery. She has been ac­cepted to grad­u­ate school to study pub­lic pol­icy in her home town, a city she had not pre­vi­ously con­sid­ered.</p>
    <p>And while she said she was lucky to have the means to move home, she felt that “luck” wasn’t quite the right word.</p>
    <p>“It’s priv­i­lege,” she said.</p>
    <p>In a world where there is “sys­temic in­jus­tice ev­ery­where”, Ms Rose said this ex­pe­ri­ence has helped her de­cide where she wants to put her en­ergy next.</p>
    <p>“This is not where I ex­pected to be in 2020, but it is ex­actly where I’m meant to be,” she said.</p>
