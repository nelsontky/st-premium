    <p>spread by tainted bot­tles of hand sani­tiser.</p>
    <p>Ms Yang Dong-sook, another pas­tor, said the Sarang Jeil Church at one point re­ceived bot­tles of what looked like hand sani­tiser that smelled more like chem­i­cals.</p>
    <p>“We ig­nored it then, but now that I see so many in­fec­tions, I think it could be true,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mr Moon on Fri­day called for le­gal penal­ties for any­one ob­struct­ing anti-virus mea­sures, in­clud­ing those con­duct­ing “all-out mis­in­for­ma­tion cam­paigns”.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Kwon Yon-gy­ong, dean of the Grad­u­ate School of Chris­tian Stud­ies at Seoul’s Soongsil Univer­sity, said Sarang Jeil Church was closer to a po­lit­i­cal or­gan­i­sa­tion than a re­li­gious com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“Rev­erend Jun Kwang-hoon is a po­lit­i­cal fig­ure – a far-right po­lit­i­cal icon. He is a pas­tor, but has earned ex­po­sure through the far-right po­lit­i­cal move­ment.”</p>
    <p>The leader of the Shin­cheonji Church of Je­sus, Lee Man-hee, was ar­rested on Aug 1 after be­ing ac­cused of hin­der­ing the virus re­sponse by hid­ing in­for­ma­tion about the church’s mem­bers and gath­er­ings, al­le­ga­tions which he de­nies.</p>
    <p>GENEVA • The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) says it hopes the planet will be rid of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic in less than two years – faster than it took for the Span­ish flu.</p>
    <p>“We hope to fin­ish this pan­demic be­fore less than two years,” WHO di­rec­tor-gen­eral Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus told re­porters on Fri­day in Geneva, hours be­fore the global death toll from Covid-19 topped 800,000.</p>
    <p>Dr Te­dros in­sisted that it should be pos­si­ble for the world to tame the coro­n­avirus faster than it took for it to bring the deadly 1918 pan­demic un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with back then, the world to­day is at a dis­ad­van­tage due to its “glob­al­i­sa­tion, close­ness, con­nect­ed­ness”, which has al­lowed the virus to spread around the globe at light­ning speed, Dr Te­dros ac­knowl­edged, but added that the world now also has the ad­van­tage of far bet­ter tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>By “util­is­ing the avail­able tools to the max­i­mum and hop­ing that we can have ad­di­tional tools like vac­cines, I think we can fin­ish it in a shorter time than the 1918 flu”, he said.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has to date killed more than 800,000 peo­ple and in­fected more than 23 mil­lion world­wide.</p>
    <p>But the dead­li­est pan­demic in modern history, the Span­ish flu, killed as many as 50 mil­lion vic­tims and in­fected around 500 mil­lion glob­ally be­tween Fe­bru­ary 1918 and April 1920.</p>
    <p>Five times more peo­ple died from the ill­ness than there were ca­su­al­ties from World War I. The first vic­tims were recorded in the United States, be­fore it spread to Europe and then around the world.</p>
    <p>That pan­demic came in three waves, with the dead­li­est sec­ond wave beginning in the lat­ter half of 1918. “It took three waves for the dis­ease to in­fect most of the sus­cep­ti­ble in­di­vid­u­als,” WHO emer­gen­cies chief Michael Ryan told jour­nal­ists.</p>
    <p>After that, the flu virus be­hind the pan­demic evolved into a far less deadly sea­sonal bug, which re­turned for decades.</p>
    <p>“Very of­ten, a pan­demic virus set­tles into a sea­sonal pat­tern over time,” Dr Ryan said.</p>
    <p>He warned, though, that so far, “this virus is not dis­play­ing a sim­i­lar wave-like pat­tern”.</p>
    <p>“Clearly, when the dis­ease is not un­der con­trol, it jumps straight back up,” he said.</p>
    <p>In the cur­rent pan­demic, Latin Amer­ica and the Caribbean is now the worst-hit re­gion, with about 255,000 Covid-19 deaths. More than half of the global fa­tal­i­ties have been re­ported in four coun­tries – the United States, Brazil, Mex­ico and In­dia.</p>
    <p>The to­tal num­ber of deaths has dou­bled since June 6, and 100,000 have been recorded in the last 17 days alone. The global toll reached 400,000 some 147 days after the an­nounce­ment of the first fa­tal­ity in China, but took just 77 days to reach 800,000.</p>
    <p>The US re­ported the most fa­tal­i­ties over the past week, with nearly 7,000 deaths, fol­lowed by Brazil, In­dia, Mex­ico and Colom­bia.</p>
    <p>Bel­gium re­mains the coun­try with the great­est num­ber of deaths per capita – 86 for every 100,000 in­hab­i­tants – fol­lowed by Peru, Spain, Bri­tain and Italy.</p>
    <p>In­dia crossed three mil­lion in­fec­tions yes­ter­day, just 13 days after log­ging two mil­lion cases.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Ger­many recorded its high­est num­ber of new cases in over four months as the au­thor­i­ties boosted test­ing and sum­mer trav­ellers re­turned home. Ger­man cases rose by over 2,000, the most since April, ac­cord­ing to data from the Robert Koch In­sti­tute, the Ger­man gov­ern­ment’s mon­i­tor­ing agency.</p>
    <p>But Europe’s re­newed surge of coro­n­avirus cases seems to be less deadly than the first wave. Ger­many yes­ter­day re­ported just seven deaths linked to virus com­pli­ca­tions.</p>
