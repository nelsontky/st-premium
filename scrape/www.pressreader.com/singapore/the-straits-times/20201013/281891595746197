    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASHINGTON When the US ju­di­ciary com­mit­tee con­sid­ers the nom­i­na­tion of Judge Amy Coney Bar­rett to the Supreme Court, Ms Ka­mala Har­ris will take on an out­size role in the pro­ceed­ings as the Demo­cratic Party’s vice-pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee. Al­most as many eyes will be on her as on Ms Bar­rett.</p>
    <p>De­spite be­ing the low­est-rank­ing Demo­crat on the panel, Ms Har­ris’ seat there will pro­vide her a prom­i­nent plat­form to frame the stakes of Ms Bar­rett’s nom­i­na­tion for vot­ers and am­plify the mes­sage that Mr Joe Bi­den, the party stan­dard­bearer, is press­ing as Nov 3 looms.</p>
    <p>But it will also re­quire her to strike a del­i­cate bal­ance – one that she has been forced to cal­i­brate ever since she joined Mr Bi­den on the Demo­cratic ticket – be­tween be­ing on the at­tack and com­ing across as sin­cere and broadly ap­peal­ing.</p>
    <p>Col­leagues say Ms Har­ris’ ca­pa­ble turn at the de­bate last week against Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence made it clear she will have done her home­work and be un­afraid to chal­lenge Ms Bar­rett, ar­gu­ing that she poses a grave threat to the Af­ford­able Care Act (ACA) and abor­tion rights.</p>
    <p>“Ka­mala Har­ris has al­ready shown her­self to be well grounded and well pre­pared, but also able to ask pointed ques­tions,” said Demo­cratic Sen­a­tor Chris Coons, a fel­low mem­ber of the panel. “She will help make clear to the Amer­i­can peo­ple the enor­mous con­se­quences of Judge Bar­rett be­ing con­firmed to the Supreme Court.”</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris has said she will at­tend the hear­ings from her Se­nate of­fice, re­in­forc­ing the Demo­cratic ar­gu­ment that Repub­li­cans are act­ing ir­re­spon­si­bly i n push­ing for­ward with t he pro­ceed­ings even as Covid-19 has in­fected mem­bers of the com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>Still, Repub­li­cans ex­pect Ms Har­ris to be among the most out­spo­ken against the nom­i­na­tion, given her prom­i­nent po­lit­i­cal role and their mem­ory of her par­tic­i­pa­tion at other Se­nate con­fir­ma­tion bat­tles.</p>
    <p>In 2018, j ust sec­onds into the Supreme Court con­fir­ma­tion hear­ing of Jus­tice Brett Ka­vanaugh, Ms Har­ris had i nter­rupted Sen­a­tor Chuck Grass­ley, then the chair­man of the ju­di­ciary com­mit­tee, with a sharp de­mand to be recog­nised.</p>
    <p>“We can­not move for­ward, Mr Chair­man, with this hear­ing,” she in­sisted af­ter he tried re­peat­edly to si­lence her. Mr Ka­vanaugh went on to be con­firmed af­ter a sear­ing fight fea­tur­ing sharp ques­tion­ing by the</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia sen­a­tor.</p>
    <p>Two years on, af­ter Ms Har­ris’ se­lec­tion by Mr Bi­den, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump ac­cused her of be­ing “ex­traor­di­nar­ily nasty” to Mr Ka­vanaugh in her ques­tion­ing.</p>
    <p>Democrats say the crit­i­cism re­flects the Repub­li­cans’ con­cern about the for­mer pros­e­cu­tor’s abil­i­ties when grilling wit­nesses.</p>
    <p>“I think this is an op­por­tu­nity for her be­cause she is just so great as a ques­tioner and as a force for jus­tice,” said Sen­a­tor Richard Blu­men­thal, an­other Demo­crat on the panel.</p>
    <p>In the Ka­vanaugh hear­ings, Ms Har­ris quizzed the nom­i­nee on var­i­ous top­ics such as abor­tion rights and Mr Trump’s com­ment about a white su­prem­a­cist rally in Char­lottesvill­e, Vir­ginia, in 2017 that there was “blame on both sides”.</p>
    <p>“Do you, sir, be­lieve there was blame on both sides?” she asked with the ac­cusatory style of a pros­e­cu­tor. Mr Ka­vanaugh re­fused to an­swer, say­ing judges should “stay out of com­ment­ing on cur­rent events”.</p>
    <p>Prob­a­bly her most noted line of in­quiry, though, came up empty af­ter a lengthy ex­change with Mr Ka­vanaugh over whether he had dis­cussed the spe­cial coun­sel in­ves­ti­ga­tion of Mr Trump and Rus­sia with any lawyers at a firm founded by a lawyer for the pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>“Be sure about your an­swer, sir,” she warned in a tone that in­ti­mated she knew the an­swer and it was not good for Mr Ka­vanaugh. He re­sponded that he was un­sure, since Ms Har­ris would not pro­vide a name. Af­ter some in­ves­ti­ga­tion, Mr Ka­vanaugh re­sponded the next day that he had not dis­cussed the in</p>
    <p>quiry with any­one at the firm. The is­sue died, and Repub­li­cans scoffed that Ms Har­ris looked fool­ish.</p>
    <p>“I hope the Democrats have learnt from the an­tics of 2018... Some of the most ag­gres­sive ques­tion­ing came from Har­ris, and some of the things that lacked any cred­i­bil­ity came from her,” said Mr Grass­ley, a Repub­li­can.</p>
    <p>Democrats on the panel said they an­tic­i­pated that Ms Har­ris would join them in try­ing to use the hear­ings to show­case pol­icy di­vi­sions with Repub­li­cans over the ACA, com­monly known as Oba­macare, stress­ing that Ms Bar­rett could join four other con­ser­va­tives on the court in over­turn­ing it.</p>
