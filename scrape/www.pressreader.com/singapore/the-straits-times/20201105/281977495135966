    <p>Last Thurs­day, a trans­gen­der pro­tester wear­ing the tra­di­tional garb of a queen strut­ted down a red car­pet in a street of cen­tral Bangkok. Another pro­tester dressed like a court page – with sneak­ers – fol­lowed her, hold­ing a red um­brella aloft in the style of a royal para­sol. A crowd sat on the ground, pros­trate, eyes cast down, as is re­quired in the pres­ence of roy­alty.</p>
    <p>For cen­turies, the kings and queens of Thai­land have walked un­der para­sols that are colour-coded as­tro­log­i­cally. Ev­ery planet is as­so­ci­ated with both a colour and a day of the week, and Thai roy­als have para­sols in the colour that rep­re­sents the day on which they were born.</p>
    <p>This sym­bol­ism is just one of the means by which the monar­chy presents its le­git­i­macy as ce­les­tial, its man­date as di­vine. The state pro­motes var­i­ous stories and nar­ra­tives cel­e­brat­ing Thai­land’s mon­archs as demigods or Bud­dhas-to-be.</p>
    <p>But now all that sym­bol­ism is be­ing co-opted by the peo­ple. For sev­eral months, pro­test­ers have held marches and ral­lies call­ing for a new Con­sti­tu­tion; for Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha, the for­mer gen­eral who seized power in a coup in 2014, to step down; and, more rad­i­cally, for the monar­chy to “truly”, as pro­test­ers say, come un­der the law.</p>
    <p>King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn, who as­cended to the throne in late 2016, in­au­gu­rated his reign by ask­ing the junta to amend its new Con­sti­tu­tion, partly so he could rule from Ger­many. In 2018 he claimed di­rect con­trol over the as­sets of the Crown Prop­erty Bu­reau – the royal fam­ily’s for­tune, worth</p>
    <p>US$40 bil­lion (S$54.6 bil­lion) then. He has re­in­stated a spe­cial sta­tus for royal con­cu­bines, a defin­ing fea­ture of the ab­so­lutist kings of old.</p>
    <p>The protests can be tongue-in-cheek but they are earnest, and they are danger­ously dar­ing given the sever­ity of pun­ish­ments for any crit­i­cism of the monar­chy. They are also both cos­mopoli­tan and exquisitel­y</p>
    <p>Thai.</p>
    <p>The sym­bols they bor­row from the pro-democ­racy protests in Hong Kong in 2015 and last year – um­brel­las, black T-shirts, flash­lights in the night – have taken on a uniquely rad­i­cal sig­nif­i­cance.</p>
    <p>Light, which is as­so­ci­ated with the awak­en­ing of the Bud­dha, has long been a sym­bol of the monar­chy in Thai­land. In of­fi­cial im­ages auras glow around kings, not only in paintings but also in pho­to­graphs. The daily television pro­gramme ded­i­cated to roy­alty-re­lated news opens with a bo­nanza of light bursts and flashes.</p>
    <p>Nearly ev­ery night these days, thou­sands of pro­test­ers hold their mo­bile phones up high, beam­ing flash­lights. The Thai royal fam­ily may claim that po­lit­i­cal le­git­i­macy comes from the heav­ens, but now the pro­test­ers do as well.</p>
    <p>Their black T-shirts also are a chal­lenge to the monar­chy. An ac­tivist I spoke to last week said they evoke a so­lar eclipse – a phe­nom­e­non tra­di­tion­ally thought to be a bad omen for kings. And then there’s the plaque.</p>
    <p>One night in April 2017, a small, round brass plaque com­mem­o­rat­ing the end of ab­so­lute monar­chy in 1932 dis­ap­peared from the paving of the Royal Plaza. Another one ap­peared in its place that ex­horted cit­i­zens to wor­ship the mon­archs.</p>
    <p>Jour­nal­ists try­ing to in­ves­ti­gate what had hap­pened were in­tim­i­dated by po­lice of­fi­cers; talk of the switcha­roo im­me­di­ately was taboo.</p>
    <p>The 1932 plaque it­self had been a pointed re­sponse to another marker of power: Thai­land’s first con­sti­tu­tional gov­ern­ment had in­stalled it as a coun­ter­point to the log of Javanese cas­sia wood that the first king in the Chakri dy­nasty had or­dered put on dis­play to an­nounce the ad­vent of a new era.</p>
    <p>The sa­cred log was im­planted in the royal grounds on April 21, 1782, at pre­cisely 6.54am. At that mo­ment, the sun was in Aries and Mars in Taurus. The first align­ment was an au­gur of pow­er­ful kings and a long-last­ing dy­nasty, the sec­ond of a bold and influentia­l army.</p>
    <p>Some astrologer­s look upon the 1932 plaque as a threat to the or­der of things as they had been. They have said the ce­les­tial align­ment at the mo­ment it was in­stalled favoured pop­u­lar sovereignt­y over the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>And when that plaque was re­placed in 2017, some whis­pered that the move sig­nalled another correction, a re­turn to pre-con­sti­tu­tional, ab­so­lutist times. King Va­ji­ra­longkorn is the 10th monarch of the Chakri dy­nasty.</p>
    <p>The pro­test­ers to­day know very well this lan­guage of power and how to bor­row its sym­bol­ism.</p>
    <p>Nine is an aus­pi­cious num­ber in much of South-east Asia, rep­re­sent­ing the nine plan­ets and plan­e­tary deities in tra­di­tional Hindu-Bud­dhist cos­mol­ogy. One day in late Septem­ber – the ninth month – nine protest lead­ers knelt on the royal pa­rade grounds out­side the Grand Palace in Bangkok. While one, wear­ing the white robes of a court astrologer, chanted prayers, the oth­ers pressed yet another plaque into a block of fresh ce­ment in the ground.</p>
    <p>Also round and made of brass, the plaque fea­tured the three-fin­ger salute from The Hunger Games movies and text that read: “This coun­try be­longs to the peo­ple. It is not the king’s prop­erty as they have de­cep­tively told us.”</p>
    <p>The plaque dis­ap­peared that night. But nu­mer­ous repli­cas soon popped up else­where, be­yond the state’s im­me­di­ate reach, as In­ter­net memes and on stick­ers, mag­nets, tat­toos, T-shirts and bar­be­cue grills.</p>
    <p>For cen­turies, of­fi­cial pro­pa­ganda has por­trayed the man­date of Thai­land’s kings as di­vine. Now the pro­test­ers are ap­pro­pri­at­ing that sym­bol­ism to crown them­selves the coun­try’s right­ful sov­er­eigns.</p>
