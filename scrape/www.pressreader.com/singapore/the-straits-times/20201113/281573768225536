    <p>A US$600 mil­lion (S$809 mil­lion) life­line has been of­fered by Te­masek unit Heli­co­nia Cap­i­tal Man­age­ment to the trou­bled Pa­cific In­ter­na­tional Lines (PIL), paving the way for a res­cue of the world’s 10th-largest con­tainer ship­ping line now fac­ing “tremen­dous strain on its liq­uid­ity”.</p>
    <p>A US$600 mil­lion (S$809 mil­lion) life­line has been of­fered by Te­masek unit Heli­co­nia Cap­i­tal Man­age­ment to trou­bled Pa­cific In­ter­na­tional Lines (PIL).</p>
    <p>This paves the way for a res­cue of the world’s 10th-largest con­tainer ship­ping line, now fac­ing “tremen­dous strain on its liq­uid­ity” amid the pan­demic-in­duced re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>Ne­go­ti­a­tions with Heli­co­nia and PIL’s lenders have been com­pleted, and the Sin­ga­pore-based box­ship op­er­a­tor plans to im­ple­ment the re­struc­tur­ing via a scheme of ar­range­ment.</p>
    <p>But the deal hinges on ma­jor­ity ap­proval from cred­i­tors which are owed US$3.5 bil­lion, sources told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>A US$112 mil­lion emer­gency credit fa­cil­ity has been ad­vanced to PIL to pay over­due trade ven­dors and fund other op­er­at­ing cash re­quire­ments, sources say.</p>
    <p>The re­main­der of the US$600 mil­lion pack­age, which com­prises a mix of debt and eq­uity in­vest­ment, will be used to “re­pay crit­i­cal ven­dors and re­cal­i­brate PIL’s cap­i­tal struc­ture to sus­tain­able levels”, the com­pany told the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX) on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, PIL’s lawyers from Wong-Part­ner­ship filed an ap­pli­ca­tion to the High Court to hold a meet­ing for cred­i­tors to vote on the re­struc­tur­ing pack­age next Jan­uary. PIL also seeks to in­clude hold­ers of PIL $60 mil­lion fixed rate bonds due this year in the scheme.</p>
    <p>The firm also filed an ap­pli­ca­tion for mora­to­rium pro­tec­tion to keep cred­i­tors from start­ing windin­gup or en­force­ment pro­ceed­ings. The hear­ing date on the ap­pli­ca­tions has not been set.</p>
    <p>The scheme must be ap­proved by a ma­jor­ity rep­re­sent­ing at least 75 per cent in value of each class of cred­i­tors present and vot­ing at each scheme meet­ing. Al­ter­na­tively, the scheme must be ap­proved by a ma­jor­ity rep­re­sent­ing at least 75 per cent in value of at least one class of cred­i­tors and ap­proved by a ma­jor­ity rep­re­sent­ing at least 75 per cent in value of all scheme cred­i­tors.</p>
    <p>If the req­ui­site ma­jor­ity vote is se­cured, PIL’s re­struc­tur­ing could be com­pleted by the first quar­ter of next year, sources say. Heli­co­nia will own a ma­jor­ity in­ter­est in PIL upon com­ple­tion.</p>
    <p>Heli­co­nia could not be reached for com­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A Bloomberg re­port in June cited sources say­ing that Heli­co­nia is keen to take a stake in PIL in part to se­cure lo­gis­tics for food sup­plies to Sin­ga­pore amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>PIL’s ex­ec­u­tive chair­man and man­ag­ing direc­tor Teo Siong Seng, who is bet­ter known as S.S. Teo, told cred­i­tors on Wed­nes­day that “2018 to 2020 have been chal­leng­ing years for the con­tainer ship­ping industry, with the down­turn fur­ther ex­ac­er­bated by the pro­longed im­pact of the pan­demic”.</p>
    <p>In meet­ing min­utes filed with SGX, Mr Teo said: “On the back of a smooth-sail­ing 2017 in the ship­ping industry, many con­tainer lin­ers were overly op­ti­mistic in in­creas­ing ca­pac­ity dur­ing 2018, re­sult­ing in ca­pac­ity over­sup­ply and falling freight rates. Com­bined with es­ca­lat­ing bunker prices, con­tainer lin­ers, in­clud­ing PIL, were faced with com­pressed mar­gins and cash flows.”</p>
    <p>He added that de­spite ini­tia­tives to im­prove prof­itabil­ity, the un­favourable industry dy­nam­ics and PIL’s un­sus­tain­able cap­i­tal struc­ture re­sulted in con­tin­ued losses in 2018 and last year.</p>
    <p>An­tic­i­pat­ing a fur­ther down­turn, PIL be­gan talks with fi­nan­cial lenders to con­sen­su­ally re­pro­file its debts, and en­tered into a prin­ci­pal and in­ter­est mora­to­rium in the sec­ond quar­ter of this year, Mr Teo said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the global econ­omy con­tin­ued to de­te­ri­o­rate dur­ing the pan­demic, re­sult­ing in PIL “fac­ing tremen­dous strain on its liq­uid­ity, which threat­ens its abil­ity to op­er­ate as a go­ing con­cern”.</p>
    <p>To re­cap­i­talise its busi­ness, PIL be­gan talks with Heli­co­nia in May on an in­vest­ment into PIL, and then en­tered into a six-month ex­clu­siv­ity agree­ment with the firm.</p>
    <p>“This is dif­fer­ent from re­struc­tur­ing at­tempts like Hin Leong or Hyflux, which filed for bank­ruptcy pro­tec­tion and then used the time to find in­vestors. If PIL had gone that route, it would have ended up like Han­jin,” a source close to the deal said, re­fer­ring to Han­jin Ship­ping, which was once the largest ship­ping line in South Korea and the seventh-big­gest in the world, but went bank­rupt in 2016 af­ter ex­cess ca­pac­ity caused the industry’s worst cri­sis at the time.</p>
    <p>“In PIL’s case, the lenders sup­ported a stand­still on en­force­ment ac­tions un­til the end of 2020, and PIL used the time to find an in­vestor. Once PIL se­cured a deal with the in­vestor and ma­jor cred­i­tors, then it ap­plied to court to hold a scheme meet­ing,” the source said.</p>
