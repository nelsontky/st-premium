    <p>One is a Bangladesh­i worker whose baby was born dur­ing the more than two months he spent in in­ten­sive care. The other is a lo­cal church pas­tor.</p>
    <p>They have more in com­mon than a cur­sory glance may sug­gest.</p>
    <p>Not only were they both stricken with Covid-19, but they were in­fected by the same clade – or branch – of the coro­n­avirus, mak­ing them part of the same clus­ter.</p>
    <p>The ex­act in­fec­tion link be­tween Mr Raju Sarker, who was part of the Sele­tar Aero­space Heights con­struc­tion site clus­ter, and the Rev­erend Wil­son Teo of the Grace Assem­bly of God church clus­ter, re­mains a mys­tery.</p>
    <p>But that they both be­long to the same clus­ter is be­yond doubt, as the virus in both men had a unique ge­netic marker.</p>
    <p>In fact, sci­en­tists now know that pa­tients from the Grace Assem­bly of God, The Life Church and Mis­sions Sin­ga­pore, Sci­ence Park II and Sele­tar Aero­space Heights con­struc­tion site clus­ters, were all in­fected with clade S, which had the unique ge­netic marker, mak­ing them part of the same clus­ter.</p>
    <p>While the pan­demic started in the cen­tral Chi­nese city of Wuhan – which is thus the source of all the coro­n­aviruses that cause Covid-19 – the virus mu­tated into a num­ber of dis­tinc­tive clades as it raged around the world.</p>
    <p>Such mu­ta­tions al­low sci­en­tists to track the way the pan­demic has spread by ob­serv­ing the move­ments of these clades.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has, at one time or an­other since the start of the year, seen all the Sars-CoV-2 vi­ral clades, or their sub­clades, that are found glob­ally.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists here use the same clas­si­fi­ca­tion as Gi­said (Global Ini­tia­tive on Shar­ing All In­fluenza Data), which has four pri­mary clades – S, L, V and G – three sub­clades of G called GR, GH and GV, and a group of un­clas­si­fied clades des­ig­nated O, for “oth­ers”.</p>
    <p>This clas­si­fi­ca­tion ac­tu­ally comes from Sin­ga­pore, as it was de­vel­oped by Dr Se­bas­tian Mau­r­erStroh, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor (des­ig­nate) at the Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search’s Bioinforma­tics In­sti­tute, and his team.</p>
    <p>It was adopted for use by the apo­lit­i­cal, not-for-profit, in­ter­na­tional sci­en­tific or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Thanks to the genomes se­quenced in Sin­ga­pore – which all go to­wards the in­ter­na­tional Gi­said data­base – the Repub­lic is shown to have been suc­cess­ful in con­tain­ing the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Such ge­nomic se­quenc­ing not only helps to con­nect dif­fer­ent, pre­vi­ously un­linked clus­ters, it also in­di­cates how ef­fec­tively the spread of Covid-19 is be­ing tack­led.</p>
    <p>The S clade with the unique ge­netic marker, for ex­am­ple, was seen once in Tai­wan early on, but is not found glob­ally now, so it shows that Sin­ga­pore was able to to­tally con­tain and erad­i­cate it.</p>
    <p>Dr Mau­rer-Stroh said: “The im­por­tant thing is that al­though there were some clus­ters here, they have been well con­tained. So it has not been found any­where else in the world. It has be­come ex­tinct.”</p>
    <p>Other clades that no longer cir­cu­late here are clades L and V.</p>
    <p>Clade L came here di­rectly from Wuhan and was part of the Yong Thai Hang health prod­ucts shop clus­ter – Sin­ga­pore’s first Covid-19 clus­ter – with nine peo­ple.</p>
    <p>This clade, brought in by a group of vis­i­tors, also caused the Grand Hy­att clus­ter that saw three lo­cal res­i­dents and four for­eign­ers in­fected, all of whom at­tended the same busi­ness con­fer­ence from Jan 20 to 22 at the ho­tel. That meet­ing spread the virus to Malaysia, South Korea and Bri­tain, where there was a medium-sized out­break, and there­after to France and Spain.</p>
    <p>Clade V, a close rel­a­tive of clade L in China, was part of the out­break in north­ern Italy. It was also spread across Europe, but has since been re­placed by clade G.</p>
    <p>Clade G be­came fa­mous in the re­gion ow­ing to its D614G spike mu­ta­tion, when the Malaysian health di­rec­tor-gen­eral wrongly claimed that it was 10 times more in­fec­tious than other strains. The G clade was dom­i­nant in the world from Fe­bru­ary to June.</p>
    <p>Dr Mau­rer-Stroh said G’s daugh­ter clades – GR and GH – con­tinue to dom­i­nate, with GR ac­count­ing for the large sec­ond wave in Europe, while GH is ram­pant in the United States.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore too has seen fairly large num­bers of the GR and GH clades, but largely in im­ported cases and not in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, a new mem­ber of the clade G fam­ily has emerged, named clade GV. It has been iden­ti­fied in sev­eral Euro­pean coun­tries, in­clud­ing Spain and Switzer­land, since July, and be­come more ac­tive since Septem­ber. Sin­ga­pore has had a cou­ple of im­ported GV cases who had been quar­an­tined.</p>
    <p>Dr Mau­rer-Stroh said many who were in­fected by these clades were re­turn­ing cit­i­zens, es­pe­cially stu­dents study­ing over­seas. They were quar­an­tined or on stay-home no­tice, so these clades did not spread into the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“We are well off be­cause our bor­der pro­tec­tion is good, and there is a whole-of-gov­ern­ment ef­fort with many col­leagues do­ing in­cred­i­ble work from se­quenc­ing to con­tact trac­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>The largest num­ber of in­fec­tions here – the 54,500 peo­ple in­fected in the dor­mi­to­ries – were caused</p>
    <p>by the virus in other clades, clas­si­fied as O.</p>
    <p>The dor­mi­tory out­break was caused by a sub­clade that is re­ferred to as O(B.6). It is one large</p>
    <p>con­nected clus­ter, but it was con­nected over sev­eral months. This clade most likely came to Sin­ga­pore from In­dia.</p>
    <p>Dr Mau­rer-Stroh ex­plained: “We looked at the time of the be­gin­ning of our O(B.6) cases, and there was a large ma­jor­ity of the same type in In­dia as well as a hand­ful also in Malaysia and Aus­tralia.”</p>
    <p>While genomes se­quenced throw up some in­ter­est­ing links, they do not tell the whole story.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause in most coun­tries, se­quenc­ing is done only for the virus taken from se­lected pa­tients. Also, some coun­tries, no­tably in Europe, do far more se­quenc­ing than oth­ers.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, many of the re­cent asymp­to­matic com­mu­nity cases had very low vi­ral loads. While they can be con­firmed to have Covid-19, it makes get­ting a full genome se­quence dif­fi­cult.</p>
    <p>So it is like read­ing sev­eral chap­ters of a book at ran­dom, and some­times, not even in or­der, while miss­ing other chap­ters.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, it does throw light on a rag­ing pan­demic.</p>
