    <p>The swear­ing-in cer­e­mony for a new Cabi­net at the Is­tana is tra­di­tion­ally at­tended by mem­bers of the es­tab­lish­ment and in­vited guests from a cross-sec­tion of so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>With the coun­try in the grip of the Covid-19 pan­demic, this year’s cer­e­mony was a far more quiet af­fair, split up over two lo­ca­tions for safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>In the Is­tana’s State Room were Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob and Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon, along with Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong and half the Cabi­net.</p>
    <p>The oth­ers, in­clud­ing Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat and Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing, took their oaths in Par­lia­ment House in­stead. Mr Heng and Mr Chan are the Peo­ple Ac­tion Party’s (PAP) first and sec­ond as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­er­als, re­spec­tively, and head the party’s fourth-gen­er­a­tion lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>The two venues were linked by video, with po­lit­i­cal of­fice-hold­ers on both sides able to see each other. But their seats were spaced out at reg­u­lar in­ter­vals, driv­ing home the mes­sage of safe dis­tanc­ing. In­vited guests, too, watched the pro­ceed­ings from sep­a­rate rooms in each building.</p>
    <p>Also in­vited were PAP MPs past and present, and the Work­ers’ Party’s newly elected MPs. PM Lee later posed for a we­fie with WP chief Pri­tam Singh, whom he has des­ig­nated Leader of the Op­po­si­tion, af­ter the event.</p>
    <p>Like the PAP MPs, the WP MPs were split too – with Alju­nied GRC MPs at the Is­tana, and Sengkang GRC MPs and Hougang MP Den­nis Tan at Par­lia­ment House.</p>
    <p>The cer­e­monies of pre­vi­ous years wel­comed guests of ev­ery stripe – from top civil ser­vants to blue-col­lar work­ers, who would min­gle with the newly sworn-in min­is­ters on the Is­tana’s man­i­cured lawns af­ter the cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>But this year’s guest list was far more pared down. It in­cluded MPs, former po­lit­i­cal of­fice-hold­ers, am­bas­sadors from around the re­gion, judges, per­ma­nent sec­re­taries and the chair­men of statutory boards. All of them, too, had to sit far apart in the in­ter­est of health and safety.</p>
    <p>A mask adorned ev­ery face, from the cam­era crew film­ing the event to the Pres­i­dent’s aidesde-camp.</p>
    <p>Many wore the ba­sic sur­gi­cal va­ri­ety, although some – like Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo and Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice In­dra­nee Ra­jah – wore fash­ion­able cloth cre­ations that blended in seam­lessly with their for­mal at­tire.</p>
    <p>Newly minted MP Yip Hon Weng even had on a unique beige-coloured cre­ation with a clear plas­tic panel in the front, show­ing off his beam­ing smile.</p>
    <p>PM Lee was the first to be sworn in at the Is­tana, fol­lowed by DPM Heng and Se­nior Min­is­ter Teo Chee Hean at Par­lia­ment House, and Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam at the Is­tana.</p>
    <p>Each took their oaths in­di­vid­u­ally, led by CJ Menon. They were then pre­sented with their in­stru­ments of ap­point­ment by Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob or, for those in Par­lia­ment House, by Mr Eddie Teo, who chairs the Coun­cil of Pres­i­den­tial Ad­vis­ers.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 33 min­is­ters and min­is­ters of state took their oath of of­fice dur­ing the pro­ceed­ings, which lasted a lit­tle over an hour.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the for­mal­i­ties were over, it was time to snap pho­tos and up­load so­cial me­dia posts to com­mem­o­rate the oc­ca­sion.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng posted a photo of the politi­cians and their spouses pos­ing for a pic­ture out­side Par­lia­ment House, while Speaker of Par­lia­ment Tan Chuan-Jin posted a rue­ful shot of him­self ad­just­ing the strap of his mask, which ap­peared to have snapped.</p>
    <p>“Les­son learnt: Don’t fid­dle with mask. Make friends with cam­era­man,” he wrote. “Al­ways prac­tise your knots.”</p>
