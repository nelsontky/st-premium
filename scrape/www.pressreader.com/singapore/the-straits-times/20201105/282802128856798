    <p>The Indian en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try has in re­cent years flour­ished well be­yond the bounds of Bol­ly­wood and the cliches as­so­ci­ated with it. This is thanks in no small part to the pro­lif­er­a­tion of stream­ing ser­vices in the coun­try and the grow­ing role they have af­forded women on both sides of the cam­era.</p>
    <p>Em­body­ing this trend are Lara Dutta and Rasika Du­gal, movie stars who have made the leap from tra­di­tional Bol­ly­wood films to edgier and more fe­male-cen­tric projects on stream­ing plat­forms.</p>
    <p>In re­cent tele­phone in­ter­views from Mum­bai, the pair spoke to The Straits Times about two such se­ries: Hun­dred, an ac­tion com­edy star­ring Dutta; and Out Of Love, a psy­cho­log­i­cal drama head­lined by Du­gal. Both shows are on the Indian stream­ing ser­vice Hot­star, which launched in Sin­ga­pore last Sun­day. (See other story.)</p>
    <p>Dutta, 42, con­firms what other ob­servers of the Indian en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try have noted: Women are play­ing a more prom­i­nent role in se­ries and films as stream­ing video ser­vices have boomed.</p>
    <p>Another fac­tor is the en­try of Amer­i­can stream­ing gi­ants Net­flix and Ama­zon Prime Video onto the scene, with more than half the Net­flix films re­leased in In­dia this year hav­ing a fe­male di­rec­tor or pro­ducer.</p>
    <p>In Hun­dred, Dutta plays Saumya Shukla, a po­lice of­fi­cer whose ca­reer is stymied be­cause of her gen­der. Then she meets Ne­tra Patil (Rinku Ra­jguru) – a girl with just a hun­dred days to live be­cause of an ill­ness – and de­cides to turn her into an un­der­cover agent.</p>
    <p>The two women are the stars of the acer­bically funny story, which also of­fers a sting­ing cri­tique of sex­ism.</p>
    <p>“The ad­vent of dig­i­tal plat­forms in In­dia has re­ally been a god­send for the in­dus­try,” says Dutta. “The writ­ing and the char­ac­ters are far bet­ter in qual­ity com­pared to what we had pre­vi­ously, es­pe­cially for women,” says the 2000 Miss Uni­verse pageant win­ner.</p>
    <p>Dutta, who starred in the hit films No En­try (2005) and Don 2 (2011), adds: “We’re fi­nally be­ing al­lowed to play women that are well­writ­ten, lay­ered and have their faults.”</p>
    <p>Her char­ac­ter in Hun­dred is a per­fect ex­am­ple – “un­abashedly am­bi­tious and liv­ing life on her own terms” – in­clud­ing hav­ing an ex­tra­mar­i­tal re­la­tion­ship “that’s at her own con­ve­nience”.</p>
    <p>In Out Of Love – an adap­ta­tion of the hit Bri­tish se­ries Doc­tor Fos­ter (2015 to 2017), Du­gal, 35, plays a physi­cian who be­gins to think her hus­band is cheat­ing on her.</p>
    <p>Du­gal’s ca­reer has taken off be­cause of pop­u­lar stream­ing ti­tles such as Net­flix’s hit po­lice pro­ce­dural Delhi Crime (2019) and Ama­zon’s crime thriller Mirza­pur (2018 to now).</p>
    <p>The stream­ing space has “re­ally pushed the bound­aries and bro­ken out of for­mu­laic writ­ing – things that, in Indian cin­ema, would get you cer­tain num­bers at the box of­fice”, says Du­gal, who ear­lier this year ap­peared in the Bri­tish television se­ries A Suit­able Boy.</p>
    <p>She be­lieves what is hap­pen­ing on-screen also re­flects what has been hap­pen­ing off-screen.</p>
    <p>“We’re go­ing through a phase in our coun­try where we are re­ally ques­tion­ing stereo­types about women.”</p>
    <p>The pop­u­lar­ity of fe­male-led stream­ing se­ries such as Out Of Love, Hun­dred and Delhi Crime in</p>
    <p>In­dia demon­strates that au­di­ences there have been ready for more di­verse, pro­gres­sive and nu­anced stories all along, Du­gal adds.</p>
    <p>“I’ve felt for the long­est time that au­di­ences in In­dia were ready for much more than we were giv­ing them,” she says.</p>
    <p>Hun­dred and Out Of Love are stream­ing on Hot­star.</p>
