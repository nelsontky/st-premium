    <p>Robots will de­stroy 85 million jobs at mid-sized to large busi­nesses over the next five years as the Covid-19 pan­demic ac­cel­er­ates changes in the work­place, a World Eco­nomic Fo­rum (WEF) study has found.</p>
    <p>Sur­veys of nearly 300 global com­pa­nies found four out of five busi­ness ex­ec­u­tives were ac­cel­er­at­ing plans to digi­tise work and de­ploy new tech­nolo­gies, un­do­ing employment gains made since the fi­nan­cial cri­sis of 2007-2008.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 has ac­cel­er­ated the ar­rival of the fu­ture of work,” WEF manag­ing direc­tor Saa­dia Zahidi said.</p>
    <p>For work­ers set to re­main in their roles in the next five years, nearly half would need to learn new skills, and by 2025, em­ploy­ers will di­vide work be­tween hu­mans and ma­chines equally, the study found.</p>
    <p>Over­all, job cre­ation is slow­ing and job de­struc­tion is ac­cel­er­at­ing as com­pa­nies around the world use tech­nol­ogy rather than peo­ple for data en­try, ac­count­ing and ad­min­is­tra­tion du­ties.</p>
    <p>The good news is that more than 97 million jobs will emerge across the care econ­omy, in tech in­dus­tries like ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI), and in con­tent cre­ation, Geneva-based WEF said.</p>
    <p>“The tasks where hu­mans are set to re­tain their com­par­a­tive ad­van­tage in­clude manag­ing, ad­vis­ing, de­ci­sion-mak­ing, rea­son­ing, com­mu­ni­cat­ing and in­ter­act­ing,” it said.</p>
    <p>De­mand would rise for work­ers who can fill green econ­omy jobs, cut­ting-edge data and AI func­tions, and new roles in en­gi­neer­ing, cloud com­put­ing and prod­uct de­vel­op­ment.</p>
