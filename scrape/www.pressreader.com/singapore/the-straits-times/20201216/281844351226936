    <p>PARIS • French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron said on Mon­day that he plans to call a ref­er­en­dum on chang­ing the Con­sti­tu­tion to in­clude a com­mit­ment to fight against cli­mate change and for the pro­tec­tion of the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>Speaking to mem­bers of a Ci­ti­zen’s Con­ven­tion on Cli­mate, Mr Macron said that the ref­er­en­dum would pro­pose adding a clause to the first ar­ti­cle of the Con­sti­tu­tion which lays out the foun­da­tional prin­ci­ples of the repub­lic.</p>
    <p>“Con­sti­tu­tion­ally it (the ref­er­en­dum pro­posal) must first go to the Na­tional As­sem­bly and then the Se­nate and be voted in iden­ti­cal terms,” Mr Macron said.</p>
    <p>The Ci­ti­zen’s Con­ven­tion is com­posed of 150 ran­domly picked mem­bers of the pub­lic who were tasked by Mr Macron’s cen­trist govern­ment with propos­ing ways in which France could cut its emis­sions.</p>
    <p>They made a series of prac­ti­cal pro­pos­als from re­duc­ing speed lim­its to im­prov­ing home in­su­la­tion, but chang­ing the Con­sti­tu­tion to in­clude the cli­mate com­mit­ment and mak­ing de­stroy­ing na­ture a crime – so-called “eco­cide” – topped their list of ideas in June.</p>
    <p>Mr Macron formed the coun­cil in re­sponse to de­mands for greater “di­rect democ­racy” in the wave of the “yel­low vest” anti-govern­ment protests that rocked the coun­try in 2018 and last year.</p>
    <p>The un­ex­pect­edly fierce re­bel­lion was sparked by a planned fuel tax hike aimed at fund­ing the cli­mat­e­change fight, which crit­ics said un­fairly tar­geted peo­ple who have no choice but to rely on their cars.</p>
    <p>The last ref­er­en­dum in France was in 2005 when vot­ers were asked to back the cre­ation of a Euro­pean Con­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>They re­jected the pro­posal in a hu­mil­i­at­ing de­feat for then Pres­i­dent Jac­ques Chirac.</p>
    <p>Although the ref­er­en­dum pro­posal should clear the lower House, Na­tional As­sem­bly, where Mr Macron’s Repub­lic on the Move party com­mands a ma­jor­ity, it may face op­po­si­tion or de­lay in the Se­nate.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­den­tial elec­tions are sched­uled for the first half of 2022.</p>
    <p>Mr Macron, a 42-year-old cen­trist, has sought to sus­tain mo­men­tum in­ter­na­tion­ally to cut car­bon emis­sions as laid out in the land­mark 2015 Paris cli­mate ac­cord, which was hit by the US with­drawal un­der Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>But Mr Macron also has do­mes­tic crit­ics who ac­cuse him of pay­ing only lip ser­vice to the en­vi­ron­men­tal cause.</p>
    <p>Of the 149 ideas pro­posed by the Ci­ti­zen’s Con­ven­tion, Mr Macron said in June that he would ac­cept 146 of them, which are set to form the ba­sis of a new law.</p>
