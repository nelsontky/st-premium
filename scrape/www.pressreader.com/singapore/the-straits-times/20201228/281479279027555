    <p>With the O-level re­sults out next month, stu­dents and par­ents are likely in the midst of weigh­ing their post-sec­ondary op­tions.</p>
    <p>Ms Jeanne Liew (above), prin­ci­pal of Nanyang Polytech­nic (NYP), pro­vides some ad­vice for par­ents to help them de­cide which route might suit their child best.</p>
    <p>Which route should my child take – ju­nior col­lege (JC) or polytech­nic?</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion be­tween JC and poly is prob­a­bly the first ques­tion many would have.</p>
    <p>A lit­tle less than half of the Olevel co­hort chose the poly route as their first choice this year.</p>
    <p>A key con­sid­er­a­tion would be your child’s pre­ferred learn­ing style: Does he or she pre­fer a more aca­demic mode of learn­ing or a more ap­plied, hands-on type of learn­ing?</p>
    <p>When they were in sec­ondary school, did they en­joy ac­tiv­i­ties, work­shops and project work bet­ter? Or did they like ex­plor­ing the the­o­ries be­hind the science, ex­plor­ing math­e­mat­i­cal logic, or delv­ing deep into his­tor­i­cal and lit­er­a­ture texts?</p>
    <p>The key dif­fer­ence is the mode of learn­ing. In polys, the em­pha­sis is on build­ing in­dus­try-rel­e­vant skills through ap­plied learn­ing. So, you will no­tice that poly cour­ses are ori­ented to­wards help­ing stu­dents ex­cel in in­dus­tries and work tasks.</p>
    <p>If your child is al­ready in­ter­ested in a spe­cific in­dus­try, say in so­cial work, health­care, cy­ber se­cu­rity or de­sign­ing ex­pe­ri­ences for cus­tomers, then a polytech­nic could be a suit­able op­tion.</p>
    <p>Polys now also have com­mon en­try pro­grammes – so if your child is un­sure about the specifics, but knows in gen­eral that he is in­ter­ested in en­gi­neer­ing, for ex­am­ple, one can join the Com­mon En­gi­neer­ing Pro­gramme. Get some fun­da­men­tals in, then de­cide which kind of en­gi­neer­ing spe­cial­i­sa­tion to pur­sue.</p>
    <p>Polys are also pro­vid­ing stu­dents with in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary skills so that a grad­u­ate can be rel­e­vant to mul­ti­ple sec­tors upon grad­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>So many diploma cour­ses sound sim­i­lar. How does one se­lect a course that will be a good fit?</p>
    <p>Many cour­ses sound some­what sim­i­lar be­cause all polys pre­pare their stu­dents for the in­dus­try – so the cour­ses would be a re­flec­tion of what in­dus­tries and sec­tors need and want.</p>
    <p>Once you have a gen­eral area in mind, I would rec­om­mend delv­ing into each of­fer­ing by the var­i­ous polys. Look at the cur­ricu­lum and the de­liv­ery. All five polys hold an Open House an­nu­ally. Next year, it is going to be from Jan 7 to 9, and all of the polys will be hold­ing their Open House on­line.</p>
    <p>Lec­tur­ers and se­nior stu­dents will be on­line to chat and answer your ques­tions.</p>
    <p>If your child is re­ally un­sure, you and your child may want to at­tend an Ed­u­ca­tion and Ca­reer Guid­ance (ECG) talk/work­shop or speak to an ECG coun­sel­lor.</p>
    <p>What are some as­pects par­ents should con­sider in choos­ing a course?</p>
    <p>Choose by clus­ters first. Start by pick­ing gen­eral ar­eas or clus­ters of cour­ses that in­ter­est your child. Th­ese clus­ters can range from en­gi­neer­ing and me­dia and de­sign, to busi­ness man­age­ment, IT and ap­plied sci­ences.</p>
    <p>Think about what he en­joys study­ing, or sub­jects that your child does well in.</p>
    <p>Look at course cur­ric­ula. Once you have iden­ti­fied the clus­ters with your child, short­list the cour­ses that in­ter­est him within the clus­ters.</p>
    <p>Ex­plore the course cur­ric­ula of th­ese cour­ses, as sim­i­lar sound­ing cour­ses across the polys might still have dif­fer­ent cov­er­age and fo­cus.</p>
    <p>Look for the Open House. As men­tioned, the polys are of­fer­ing com­pre­hen­sive pro­grammes dur­ing the Open House. I will be chair­ing the Choices Af­ter O’s Par­ents’ We­bi­nar to help par­ents and chil­dren with course se­lec­tions. There will be a Q&A ses­sion too.</p>
    <p>What are the skills my child should pick up to stay ahead of the com­pe­ti­tion?</p>
    <p>The world is chang­ing rapidly. To re­main rel­e­vant, one has to make sure that the skills we learn are up to date, and we never stop our learn­ing jour­ney. We have to deepen do­main skills as well as core skills that cut across dis­ci­plines, strengthen our core val­ues and re­main ag­ile for fu­ture chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>Poly­tech­nics in­vest in fa­cil­i­ties and work closely with our part­ners so our stu­dents have ac­cess to tech­nolo­gies and equip­ment that will be chang­ing lives in the near fu­ture.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, ear­lier this year, NYP opened a new NYP-StarHub Ap­pli­ca­tion & Ex­pe­ri­ence Cen­tre for 5G to give our stu­dents the op­por­tu­nity to be at the fore­front of de­vel­op­ing 5G in­no­va­tions. We are work­ing with a tech­nol­ogy gi­ant on a cen­tre for Ar­ti­fi­cial In­tel­li­gence next.</p>
    <p>To en­sure that we re­main ag­ile, we at NYP are also re-ex­am­in­ing our own mind­sets and as­sump­tions. This year, we an­nounced how we are reimag­in­ing polytech­nic ed­u­ca­tion – with the NYP Pro­fes­sional Com­pe­tency Model.</p>
    <p>In­stead of the tra­di­tional way of teach­ing by sub­jects, in this Teach­ing & Learn­ing model, mul­ti­ple dis­ci­plines are in­te­grated and taught con­cur­rently in the con­text of an ac­tual work task. In­dus­try part­ners have strongly sup­ported this.</p>
    <p>How will poly life be dif­fer­ent from sec­ondary school?</p>
    <p>Real-world ex­pe­ri­ence. There will be hands-on learn­ing and re­al­world ex­pe­ri­ences such as in­tern­ships and in­dus­try projects.</p>
    <p>Cu­mu­la­tive GPA. Each mod­ule counts to­wards a fi­nal cu­mu­la­tive grade point av­er­age. Dis­ci­pline and con­sis­tency – also highly val­ued at­tributes in the work­place are im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>Ex­po­sure to learn­ing be­yond the class­room. At NYP, we be­lieve that learn­ing is holis­tic and goes be­yond the class­room.</p>
    <p>We of­fer Gen­eral Stud­ies Mod­ules to ex­pose stu­dents to do­main ar­eas be­yond their spe­cial­i­sa­tion. Co-cur­ric­u­lar ac­tiv­i­ties are a great way to de­velop at­tributes like team­work and lead­er­ship – and we have more than 80 of them.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents at NYP can also opt for work­shops and lunchtime talks at our Stu­dent Life Academy. In ad­di­tion, there is a whole range of over­seas pro­grammes to fur­ther ex­pand the stu­dents’ hori­zons.</p>
