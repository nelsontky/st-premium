    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s beauty in­dus­try is get­ting a skills “facelift” with the launch of a new frame­work to help more than 13,000 work­ers in the in­dus­try to plan their ca­reer and de­vel­op­ment path­ways. Un­der the frame­work, ca­reer pro­gres­sion path­ways are clearly mapped out, cov­er­ing 45 job roles across five tracks.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s beauty in­dus­try is get­ting a skills facelift with the launch of a new frame­work to help more than 13,000 work­ers in the in­dus­try to plan their ca­reer and de­vel­op­ment path­ways.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the launch of the Beauty Ser­vices Com­pe­tency Frame­work yes­ter­day, Min­is­ter of State for Trade and In­dus­try Low Yen Ling said it will serve as a sin­gle point of ref­er­ence for busi­nesses and em­ploy­ees to strengthen train­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties in a sec­tor that has “in­cred­i­ble growth po­ten­tial”.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that the beauty ser­vices in­dus­try is grow­ing at a rate of 10 per cent year on year, she said that there re­mains a strong lo­cal de­mand for beauty and well­ness ser­vices here even as Covid-19 has led to many challenges.</p>
    <p>Ms Low said: “Peo­ple still want to look good and feel great. In fact, given the cur­rent travel re­stric­tions, more peo­ple are hav­ing to look for spa and beauty ser­vices lo­cally. There is also a good level of cus­tomer con­fi­dence and as­sur­ance in our own lo­cal es­tab­lish­ments... (that they) will put in place safe man­age­ment mea­sures.”</p>
    <p>She added: “With strength in con­sumer de­mand, there is po­ten­tial for new job op­por­tu­ni­ties.”</p>
    <p>Un­der the frame­work, ca­reer pro­gres­sion path­ways are clearly mapped out, cov­er­ing 45 job roles across five tracks. For ex­am­ple, an ap­pren­tice in the nail ser­vices in­dus­try could move up the ranks to be­come a man­i­curist, a nail artist and even earn a man­age­ment role.</p>
    <p>Those work­ing in the in­dus­try can there­fore look to it for how they can up­skill to stay rel­e­vant, while in­ter­ested new en­trants can use the in­for­ma­tion to gain a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of the sec­tor and the spe­cific skills re­quired of var­i­ous roles.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness own­ers can also use the frame­work to guide de­ci­sion-mak­ing in re­cruit­ment and tal­ent man­age­ment, among other things.</p>
    <p>Ms Low men­tioned the ex­am­ple of Ms Jamie Lai, a se­nior bar­ber and trainer at Sul­tans Of Shave, a chain of men’s groom­ing sa­lons.</p>
    <p>Us­ing the frame­work, Ms Lai iden­ti­fied coach­ing skills as an area of im­prove­ment, and went on to com­plete a course at the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion (ITE) to be­come a cer­ti­fied bar­ber trainer.</p>
    <p>As her com­pany is also ap­ply­ing to be an ap­proved train­ing cen­tre within the in­sti­tute, she hopes to be a coach to not just new bar­bers where she works, but also ITE students.</p>
    <p>The frame­work was un­veiled by the Beauty Ser­vices Al­liance, which brings to­gether five trade as­so­ci­a­tions in the in­dus­try. The al­liance rep­re­sents the in­ter­ests of about 6,000 busi­nesses, and aims to cre­ate ini­tia­tives to drive the beauty ser­vices in­dus­try’s growth.</p>
    <p>Its spokesman Si­mon Lee said he hopes the frame­work will en­cour­age more Sin­ga­pore­ans to join the sec­tor as they de­velop a clearer un­der­stand­ing of the in­dus­try and the pos­si­ble ca­reer paths.</p>
    <p>He ex­pects that there will be at least 2,000 to 3,000 more po­si­tions for lo­cals over the next five years. About 40 per cent of the work­ers in the in­dus­try now are lo­cals. The rest are from neigh­bour­ing coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Al­liance rep­re­sen­ta­tive Rachel Tang said the frame­work will hope­fully rid some of the “mis­con­cep­tions” about the in­dus­try. “Beauty ther­a­pists and other pro­fes­sion­als in the beauty ser­vices in­dus­try have... not had a very good im­age, which we’re try­ing to change with this frame­work. (It) brings pro­fes­sion­al­ism and sta­tus to what we do. We’re not just pro­vid­ing the (ba­sic) ser­vice, we’re also able to give con­sul­ta­tions and more pro­fes­sional skills.”</p>
    <p>The al­liance will also work with var­i­ous gov­ern­ment agen­cies to ad­vance the beauty in­dus­try, such as by es­tab­lish­ing an ac­cred­i­ta­tion sys­tem for train­ing providers and an eval­u­a­tion sys­tem for those who wish to learn the tricks of the trade.</p>
