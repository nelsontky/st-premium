    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, dis­cus­sions on and man­age­ment of so­ci­etal fault lines are un­der­pinned by the pur­suit of har­mony and co­he­sion.</p>
    <p>To ef­fect this, the state has adopted a multi-pronged strat­egy, span­ning wide-rang­ing com­mu­nity in­sti­tu­tions, wield­ing firm lead­er­ship in scop­ing sen­si­tive con­ver­sa­tions, and act­ing as a fi­nal ar­biter of con­tentious is­sues.</p>
    <p>Most Sin­ga­pore­ans take pains to tol­er­ate cus­toms and prac­tices that they may not feel com­fort­able with, ap­pre­cia­tive of the di­verse mix of racial, re­li­gious and cul­tural prac­tices here.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, a mix of strong laws and tough poli­cies helps main­tain a har­mo­nious so­cial fab­ric.</p>
    <p>Poli­cies such as the Eth­nic In­te­gra­tion Pol­icy and en­sur­ing mi­nor­ity can­di­da­tures in group rep­re­sen­ta­tion con­stituen­cies serve to pro­mote racial in­te­gra­tion and pre­vent the marginal­i­sa­tion of mi­nori­ties – a sit­u­a­tion preva­lent in other poli­ties.</p>
    <p>Hard leg­is­la­tion, such as the Sedi­tion Act and Sec­tion 298A (which makes it an of­fence to pro­mote en­mity among dif­fer­ent groups on grounds of reli­gion or race), cou­pled with ac­tive en­force­ment, is seen as es­sen­tial to pre­serv­ing the peace. It com­pels of­fend­ing in­di­vid­u­als to cease and de­sist when it comes to so­cially di­vi­sive ac­tions.</p>
    <p>This sta­tus quo has served Sin­ga­pore well over the past few decades.</p>
    <p>Of late, how­ever, some seg­ments of Sin­ga­pore’s pop­u­la­tion have shown their dis­sat­is­fac­tion with a top-down ap­proach to pol­i­cy­mak­ing on race and reli­gion. They want to mean­ing­fully en­gage in open con­ver­sa­tions on fault lines, partly fu­elled by what they see oc­cur­ring in other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The rise of so­cial me­dia, in­de­pen­dent blogs and vi­ral con­tent fa­cil­i­tates such cit­i­zen-led so­cial ad­vo­cacy and protest.</p>
    <p>These Sin­ga­pore­ans are call­ing for the re­moval of hard leg­is­la­tion in the man­age­ment of com­mu­nal re­la­tions. They pre­fer a more lib­eral ap­proach ob­served in many de­vel­oped so­ci­eties, where public dis­cus­sion on race and reli­gion is not curbed and polic­ing is lim­ited to only the worst forms of hate speech.</p>
    <p>Such calls, how­ever, are be­ing met with dis­com­fort by other Sin­ga­pore­ans. This is not sur­pris­ing, as sur­veys show that Sin­ga­pore­ans ex­pect any mis­step in public dis­cus­sions on race and reli­gion to have a neg­a­tive im­pact.</p>
    <p>An In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies pa­per last year on so­ci­etal fault lines in Sin­ga­pore found that nearly half of the 4,000 Sin­ga­porean res­i­dents sur­veyed be­lieved that there would be sus­pi­cion and anger against com­mu­ni­ties if re­la­tions were not man­aged well, al­though two-thirds did not think that vi­o­lence could be one of these con­se­quences.</p>
    <p>With the ma­jor­ity of re­spon­dents in the sur­vey in­di­cat­ing lev­els of our racial and re­li­gious har­mony as “high” or “very high”, it might be un­think­able to them that any group in Sin­ga­pore would re­spond to a ra­cially or re­li­giously charged com­ment with vi­o­lent ac­tion.</p>
    <p>These at­ti­tudes might con­tinue to pre­vail with an in­creas­ingly ed­u­cated and glob­ally con­nected pop­u­lace.</p>
    <p>RE­CAL­I­BRATE, DON’T RE­MOVE</p>
    <p>While hard leg­is­la­tion dis­cour­ages in­di­vid­u­als from com­mit­ting acts that threaten har­mony, this ap­proach has its down­sides.</p>
    <p>The broad scope of such leg­is­la­tion, as well as per­ceived or ac­tual OB (out-of-bounds) mark­ers, and strict polic­ing of dis­cus­sions on race and reli­gion, can re­sult in an un­in­tended but sig­nif­i­cant chill­ing ef­fect on public en­gage­ment and con­ver­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>State­ments or acts made with good in­ten­tions to raise aware­ness or pro­mote so­cial jus­tice may fall into the am­bit of what is pun­ish­able. In­di­vid­u­als with thin skins may feel in­sulted, per­ceive their feel­ings to be wounded, and dial 999 to as­suage their emo­tions.</p>
    <p>While it is good that public trust in the po­lice force to en­force laws fairly is high, there should not be such a strong re­liance on se­cu­rity agen­cies to play the role of com­mu­nity me­di­a­tor.</p>
    <p>Too much re­liance on polic­ing and en­force­ment can shift at­ten­tion away from what truly mat­ters – as­sess­ing whether state­ments il­lus­trat­ing in­jus­tices are true, and if so, how one should clar­ify or re­solve these is­sues.</p>
    <p>We should strive for a bet­ter ap­proach in man­ag­ing race dis­cus­sions. For one thing, there should be guide­lines on the use – and mis­use – of po­lice re­port­ing, even as we pro­mote re­spect­ful civic en­gage­ment.</p>
    <p>Many Sin­ga­pore­ans un­der­stand that sub­stan­tive con­ver­sa­tions on race can be un­com­fort­able – es­pe­cially if they con­front the priv­i­leges of ma­jor­ity groups and delve into the un­fair treat­ment ex­pe­ri­enced by var­i­ous eth­nic or re­li­gious groups.</p>
    <p>In or­der to al­low for more public air­ing of race- and reli­gion-based is­sues even if they cause dis­com­fort, the state will need to in­tro­duce more nu­ance to ex­ist­ing leg­is­la­tion to pre­vent hon­est dis­cus­sion from in­ad­ver­tently cross­ing the line to cause of­fence and be deemed to pro­mote en­mity be­tween groups.</p>
    <p>All this, while en­sur­ing that dis­tress caused by in­sid­i­ous ac­tors is curbed.</p>
    <p>One guide­line might be to be strict about anony­mous al­le­ga­tions but more per­mis­sive of in­di­vid­u­als who pub­licly iden­tify them­selves when they speak up with anec­dotes or ex­pe­ri­ences of dis­crim­i­na­tion. After all, the lived ex­pe­ri­ences of each in­di­vid­ual are of­ten dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>The track records of the in­di­vid­u­als ex­press­ing their opin­ions and views on fault lines mat­ter too. If they have been in­volved in re­lated ac­tivism to ad­vance causes for the so­cial good, their per­spec­tives should be de­lib­er­ated upon and ad­dressed.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple should, how­ever, still act re­spon­si­bly and not add fuel to fire.</p>
    <p>Pro­vid­ing clearer frame­works on public dis­cus­sions of race and reli­gion can help steer such ex­changes to pro­mote un­der­stand­ing.</p>
    <p>A re­fusal to pub­licly ac­knowl­edge dif­fi­cult is­sues of dis­crim­i­na­tion and priv­i­lege around race can cause is­sues to sim­mer, and erupt with more force when they are brought into the open. More im­por­tantly, re­fusal to ac­knowl­edge real is­sues per­pet­u­ates in­equal­ity or in­jus­tice done to mi­nor­ity com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­pore’s law-based ap­proach to racial har­mony has kept the lid on ten­sions for decades, there is scope to ex­am­ine if this har­mony has come at a price: that of down­play­ing fric­tions in our in­ter­ra­cial re­la­tions, and turn­ing a blind eye to the fab­ric of im­plicit bias that is felt daily by mi­nori­ties but in­vis­i­ble to the ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>When dis­cussing racial har­mony, Sin­ga­pore­ans should em­bark on a mind­set shift.</p>
    <p>In the past, the fear of dis­turb­ing racial har­mony stopped many dis­cus­sions. But fear of pun­ish­ment, while ef­fec­tive, should not be the main rea­son why Sin­ga­pore­ans choose to tol­er­ate peo­ple of other races and re­li­gions.</p>
    <p>In­stead, such dis­cus­sions should be based on mu­tual re­spect and un­der­stand­ing, so that each com­mu­nity is sen­si­tive to and aware of what it feels like to be the “other”, so that we can be more “woke”, or awake and aware of dif­fi­cul­ties felt by marginalis­ed com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>But even as we dis­cuss race-based is­sues, we should make sure such dis­cus­sions are di­rected to­wards strength­en­ing the Sin­ga­porean iden­tity rather than fo­cus­ing on one’s race or cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Choos­ing to iden­tify and be­have as Sin­ga­porean first, rather than merely as eth­nic selves, can help us strengthen Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ety as a whole, and leave a more pos­i­tive im­pact on fu­ture gen­er­a­tions and how they per­ceive is­sues of race.</p>
