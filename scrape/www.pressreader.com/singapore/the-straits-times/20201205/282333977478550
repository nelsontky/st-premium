    <p>A man who was speed­ing when his car struck a taxi in 2018, re­sult­ing in the death of a Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) stu­dent, has been fined $5,000.</p>
    <p>Ng Li Ning, 24, was also dis­qual­i­fied from driv­ing all classes of ve­hi­cles for two years.</p>
    <p>He was or­dered to pay the fine on Nov 27 af­ter he pleaded guilty in a dis­trict court to driv­ing at a speed that was dan­ger­ous to the pub­lic – be­tween 83kmh and 92kmh – when the limit was 70kmh.</p>
    <p>On April 19, 2018, taxi driver Yap Kok Hua, 56, picked up four peo­ple, in­clud­ing NUS stu­dents Kathy Ong Kai Ting, 19, and Ting Jun Heng, now 23, at Cle­menti Mall at around 7.30pm. They were headed for Tem­busu College at NUS.</p>
    <p>Min­utes later, Yap de­cided to make a dis­cre­tionary right turn at a sig­nalised Cle­menti Road junc­tion, de­spite know­ing that Ng’s car was hurtling to­wards him from the op­po­site di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>The ac­ci­dent re­sulted and Ms Ong was taken to hospi­tal, where she died of mul­ti­ple in­juries that night.</p>
    <p>The three male pas­sen­gers sur­vived the crash, but Mr Ting, who suf­fered a trau­matic brain in­jury, now walks with a slight limp and has a speech im­ped­i­ment.</p>
    <p>Yap, who is no longer work­ing as a cabby, was sen­tenced to eight weeks’ jail and banned from driv­ing for five years on Aug 2 last year.</p>
    <p>He had pleaded guilty to neg­li­gent driv­ing and caus­ing Ms Ong’s death, as well as neg­li­gent driv­ing and caus­ing griev­ous hurt to the other pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>The le­gal woes of Ng and Yap, how­ever, are not over yet.</p>
    <p>Mr Ting has sued them for neg­li­gence. On Oct 2, the High Court ruled that Yap has to bear 65 per cent of the re­spon­si­bil­ity, and Ng, the other 35 per cent.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Aedit Ab­dul­lah said then: “Pri­or­ity lay with those ve­hi­cles go­ing straight; it was in­cum­bent upon (Yap) to keep a proper look­out, and ex­er­cise pru­dent judg­ment in ex­e­cut­ing the turn. If there was any doubt about whether it was safe, (Yap) should have ei­ther waited for on­com­ing traf­fic to clear, or for it to be stopped and the right-turn green ar­row traf­fic lights to come on.”</p>
    <p>He noted that Yap had failed to do so, and sim­ply fol­lowed an­other ve­hi­cle, which had turned but was not hit by on­com­ing traf­fic.</p>
    <p>The judge also found that Ng had failed to keep a proper look­out, adding: “Hav­ing the right of way es­sen­tially means that other users should yield or give way. But, hav­ing the right of way does not ab­solve that par­tic­u­lar road user of the need to ex­er­cise due care.”</p>
    <p>He re­jected ar­gu­ments by both de­fen­dants that there was con­trib­u­tory neg­li­gence by Mr Ting as he had failed to wear his seat belt.</p>
    <p>The judge said there was no other ev­i­dence on this is­sue, such as from biome­chan­i­cal or other ex­perts, that the in­juries suf­fered could have been caused only by the plain­tiff not wear­ing the seat belt.</p>
    <p>The quan­tum of dam­ages will be de­ter­mined at a sep­a­rate hear­ing and will be borne by the de­fen­dants’ in­sur­ers.</p>
