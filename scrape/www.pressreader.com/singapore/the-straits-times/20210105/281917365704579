    <p>The 2019 death of French-Ir­ish teenager Nora Anne Quoirin in a dense Malaysian jun­gle was due to mis­ad­ven­ture, an in­quest ruled yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Coroner Maimoonah Aid ruled that on the bal­ance of prob­a­bil­ity, there was “no one in­volved” in the death of the 15-year-old, who suf­fered from learn­ing dif­fi­cul­ties.</p>
    <p>“For me to spec­u­late and pre­sume of her ac­tion and in­volve­ment of a third party with­out any proved facts would be a breach of my duty,” Madam Maimoonah said in clos­ing the in­quest.</p>
    <p>The coroner’s rul­ing came af­ter a 24-day hear­ing in­volv­ing 48 wit­nesses at the Coroner’s Court in Serem­ban, in the state of Negeri Sem­bi­lan, where the teen’s naked body was found on Aug 13, 2019.</p>
    <p>Nora Anne was ini­tially re­ported miss­ing by her par­ents on Aug 4, 2019. The fam­ily had been stay­ing at Dusun, a re­sort near a dense rain­for­est in Negeri Sem­bi­lan, some 60km from Kuala Lumpur.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily of five – Nora Anne, her two si­b­lings and their par­ents – had ar­rived at the re­sort from London on Aug 3 to start their va­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Nora Anne was last seen on the night of their ar­rival. Her dis­ap­pear­ance sparked a 10-day res­cue-and­search oper­a­tion that in­volved hun­dreds of of­fi­cials from var­i­ous Malaysian agen­cies as well as lo­cal vol­un­teers, be­fore her body was found on Aug 13 near an aban­doned oil palm plan­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Nora Anne’s fam­ily had said that they sus­pected foul play in her dis­ap­pear­ance and her sub­se­quent death, while the Malaysian po­lice had ruled out foul play in the course of their in­ves­ti­ga­tions. Madam Maimoonah said that the fam­ily’s claims of Nora Anne be­ing ab­ducted re­main as the­o­ries.</p>
    <p>Post-mortem reports had pre­vi­ously in­di­cated that Nora Anne died due to in­ter­nal bleed­ing caused by star­va­tion. No signs of sex­ual as­sault were found on her body.</p>
    <p>Madam Maimoonah said that while the post mortem could not con­clu­sively rule out the pos­si­bil­ity of sex­ual as­sault hav­ing hap­pened early on in her dis­ap­pear­ance, no such ev­i­dence was found when her body was dis­cov­ered, some 10 days later.</p>
    <p>Over the course of the in­quest, pathol­o­gists re­vealed that Nora Anne likely died two or three days prior to her body be­ing dis­cov­ered, leav­ing a week’s gap in which her where­abouts were un­known.</p>
    <p>Madam Maimoonah also said that based on her find­ings, it was pos­si­ble for Nora Anne to have wan­dered out of the ac­com­mo­da­tion where her fam­ily was stay­ing and into the ad­ja­cent for­est be­fore get­ting lost.</p>
    <p>Nora Anne’s par­ents, Mr Se­bas­tian Quoirin and Mrs Me­abh Quoirin, had pre­vi­ously filed a civil suit against the op­er­a­tor of the Dusun re­sort for neg­li­gence, be­fore with­draw­ing the claim prior to the in­quest.</p>
    <p>The re­sort’s lawyer, Mr Gur­dial Singh Ni­jar, said yes­ter­day that the coroner court’s find­ing also con­firms that the re­sort op­er­a­tor was not at fault for Nora Anne’s dis­ap­pear­ance and sub­se­quent death.</p>
