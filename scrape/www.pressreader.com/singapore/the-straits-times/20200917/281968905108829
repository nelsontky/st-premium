    <p>WASH­ING­TON US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said he was not aware of the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO) rul­ing on a trade dis­pute with China, but said he would take a look at it.</p>
    <p>He re­it­er­ated that he was not a fan of the WTO, which said on Tues­day the US had breached global trad­ing rules by im­pos­ing multi­bil­lion-dol­lar tar­iffs in Mr Trump’s trade war with China.</p>
    <p>Asked about the de­ci­sion as he left the White House, Mr Trump said he had not seen it.</p>
    <p>“Then we’ll have to do some­thing about the WTO be­cause they’ve let China get away with mur­der,” he said. “We’ll take a look at that. But I’m not a big fan of the WTO – that I can tell you right now. Maybe they did us a big favour.”</p>
    <p>China’s For­eign Min­istry said yes­ter­day the rul­ing by the WTO proved the US had been break­ing in­ter­na­tional trad­ing rules.</p>
    <p>The WTO ruled that ad­di­tional tar­iffs im­posed by the US against China in 2018 were in­con­sis­tent with global trad­ing rules.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin told a press brief­ing that China hoped the US would re­spect the rul­ing.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion says its tar­iffs im­posed two years ago on more than US$200 bil­lion (S$271.5 bil­lion) of Chi­nese goods were jus­ti­fied be­cause China was steal­ing in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty and forc­ing US com­pa­nies to trans­fer tech­nol­ogy for ac­cess to China’s mar­kets.</p>
    <p>But the WTO’s three-mem­ber panel said the US du­ties broke trad­ing rules be­cause they ap­plied only to China and were above max­i­mum rates agreed to by the US. Wash­ing­ton had not then ad­e­quately ex­plained why its mea­sures were a jus­ti­fied ex­cep­tion, the panel con­cluded.</p>
    <p>“This panel re­port con­firms what the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has been say­ing for four years: The WTO is com­pletely in­ad­e­quate to stop China’s harm­ful tech­nol­ogy prac­tices,” US Trade Rep­re­sen­ta­tive (USTR) Robert Lighthizer said in re­sponse.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion will have lit­tle im­me­di­ate ef­fect on the US tar­iffs and is just the start of a le­gal process that could take years to play out, ul­ti­mately lead­ing to the WTO ap­prov­ing re­tal­ia­tory mea­sures if it is up­held – moves that China has al­ready taken on its own.</p>
    <p>The US is likely to ap­peal against Tues­day’s rul­ing. That would put the case into a le­gal void, how­ever, be­cause Wash­ing­ton has al­ready blocked the ap­point­ment of judges to the WTO’s ap­pel­late body, pre­vent­ing it from con­ven­ing the min­i­mum num­ber re­quired to hear cases.</p>
    <p>The panel was aware it was step­ping into hot water. It noted that it had looked only into the US mea­sures and not China’s re­tal­i­a­tion, which Wash­ing­ton has not chal­lenged at the WTO.</p>
    <p>“The panel is very much aware of the wider con­text in which the WTO sys­tem cur­rently op­er­ates, which is one re­flect­ing a range of un­prece­dented global trade ten­sions,” the 66-page re­port con­cluded. The panel rec­om­mended the US bring its mea­sures “into con­form­ity with its obli­ga­tions”, but also en­cour­aged the two sides to re­solve the over­all dis­pute.</p>
    <p>“Time is avail­able for the par­ties to take stock as pro­ceed­ings evolve and fur­ther con­sider op­por­tu­ni­ties for mu­tu­ally agreed and sat­is­fac­tory so­lu­tions.”</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion could help fuel a Trump de­ci­sion to l eave the 25-year-old WTO or un­der­pin US ar­gu­ments for re­form­ing it, said Ms Mar­garet Cekuta, a for­mer USTR of­fi­cial who helped write a cru­cial re­port on China’s in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty abuses t h a t p r e c e d e d Mr Trump’s tar­iffs.</p>
    <p>“It gives the ad­min­is­tra­tion ammo to say the WTO is out of date. If they can’t rule on in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty rights, then what is their po­si­tion in the broader econ­omy go­ing for­ward?” said Ms Cekuta, now a prin­ci­pal with Capi­tol Coun­sel lob­by­ing firm.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, crit­i­cal of mul­ti­lat­eral in­sti­tu­tions, has al­ready quit Unesco and plans to leave the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
