    <p>To pre­pare for growth in the post­coro­n­avirus years, Sin­ga­pore needs to pro­duce es­sen­tial food and med­i­cal sup­plies lo­cally, in­vest in and adopt en­ergy-ef­fi­cient tech­nolo­gies, and seek new business op­por­tu­ni­ties in the grow­ing “green” econ­omy.</p>
    <p>These ef­forts will make the coun­try’s econ­omy more re­silient and sus­tain­able and, in turn, give it a com­pet­i­tive advantage, said Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The build­ing of such eco­nomic re­silience and sus­tain­abil­ity is one of three “pri­or­ity ar­eas” in Sin­ga­pore’s re­freshed eco­nomic strat­egy for a post-Covid-19 world. It was set out in a min­is­te­rial state­ment in Par­lia­ment by Mr Heng, who is also Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies and Fi­nance Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Eco­nomic re­silience, how­ever, is not a new idea for Sin­ga­pore, he said, not­ing that the coun­try has achieved re­silience through a diver­si­fied econ­omy, with mul­ti­ple en­gines of growth.</p>
    <p>“No one in­dus­try ac­counts for more than 20 per cent of our GDP (gross do­mes­tic prod­uct), so we do not put all our eggs in one bas­ket.”</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, Sin­ga­pore was on a rel­a­tively strong foot­ing when the Covid-19 pan­demic struck, he said.</p>
    <p>It had enough med­i­cal sup­plies and es­sen­tial goods for its peo­ple and health­care work­ers be­cause of its na­tional stock­pile, which was backed by lo­cal pro­duc­tion and a di­verse net­work of trad­ing part­ners, Mr Heng said.</p>
    <p>But the pan­demic also ex­posed vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties. Across the world, there were short­ages of es­sen­tial goods and crit­i­cal in­puts for in­dus­trial pro­duc­tion as well as a halt in ac­cess to work­ers ow­ing to work stop­pages and travel bans.</p>
    <p>De­mand also ground to a halt in many industries, Mr Heng added.</p>
    <p>“We must there­fore act now to im­prove our eco­nomic re­silience.</p>
    <p>“In do­ing this, we may have to cre­atively com­bine the ef­fi­ciency of hav­ing things ready ‘just in time’ with the re­silience of build­ing buf­fers ‘just in case’.”</p>
    <p>One way to re­in­force re­silience and grow is to pro­duce es­sen­tial sup­plies lo­cally, which are not just for use do­mes­ti­cally but can be ex­ported as well, Mr Heng said, cit­ing med­i­cal sup­plies such as masks and test kits.</p>
    <p>An­other ex­am­ple he gave was food. Sin­ga­pore has set a “30 by 30” tar­get, which means to pro­duce 30 per cent of its nu­tri­tional needs lo­cally by 2030, up from less than 10 per cent to­day.</p>
    <p>The tech­nol­ogy used, such as in seeds and al­ter­na­tive pro­teins, can be ex­ported. “We can grow these ca­pa­bil­i­ties, build­ing on our strengths in re­search and de­vel­op­ment and our stand­ing as a trusted hub,” Mr Heng added.</p>
    <p>An im­por­tant part of a re­silient econ­omy is en­vi­ron­men­tal sus­tain­abil­ity, es­pe­cially for a fu­ture that is low car­bon and re­source con­strained, he said.</p>
    <p>It is also an op­por­tu­nity for the green sec­tor to be a growth in­dus­try in its own right, he added.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is transformi­ng its industries to be more sus­tain­able, by con­tin­u­ing to in­vest in re­search into en­ergy- and re­source-ef­fi­cient tech­nolo­gies. They will be en­cour­aged to in­vest in these tech­nolo­gies through in­cen­tives from gov­ern­ment agen­cies.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore will also set it­self up as a car­bon ser­vices hub in Asia, with de­mand for re­lated en­gi­neer­ing, le­gal and con­sul­tancy ser­vices ex­pected to in­crease in tan­dem with ef­forts to limit growth of car­bon emis­sions, said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>With fi­nance also be­ing an im­por­tant en­abler of green growth, fi­nanc­ing so­lu­tions and mar­kets in Sin­ga­pore are be­ing de­vel­oped to help firms fi­nance their adop­tion of more sus­tain­able prac­tices.</p>
    <p>These moves, taken to­gether, serve a dual pur­pose, said the Deputy Prime Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>“They strengthen our econ­omy so that we can bounce back quickly and bet­ter from shocks, while adding to our value propo­si­tion as a vi­tal global node in Asia.</p>
    <p>“In turn, all these ini­tia­tives will cre­ate many new op­por­tu­ni­ties and valu­able jobs for our peo­ple.”</p>
