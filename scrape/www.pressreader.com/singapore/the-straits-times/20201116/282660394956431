    <p>Par­ents’ en­cour­age­ment and un­der­stand­ing can help chil­dren cope with less-than-stel­lar re­sults in a year made even more chal­leng­ing by the pandemic</p>
    <p>As school­child­ren bid farewell this week to an aca­demic year like no other, re­lief will be tinged with dis­ap­point­ment for some, who may not have scored as well as they had hoped to.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts re­mind par­ents that a knee-jerk re­ac­tion to poorer than ex­pected grades does more harm than good, es­pe­cially given the aca­demic dis­rup­tions dur­ing the pandemic.</p>
    <p>It is com­mon to find par­ents putting down their kids or with­draw­ing all priv­i­leges, such as mo­bile phones and out­ings with friends, and ramp­ing up tu­ition dur­ing the year-end school hol­i­days as a form of pun­ish­ment, notes Ms Jose­lyn Loh, man­ager of Par­ent­ing Sup­port Ser­vices at Care Cor­ner Sin­ga­pore, a non-profit so­cial ser­vice agency.</p>
    <p>It pro­vides sup­port to par­ents across 24 schools in Wood­lands and Sem­bawang un­der a scheme by the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>In­stead of think­ing that their kids did not try hard enough, it is im­por­tant to delve into the real rea­son be­hind the chal­lenges, says Dr Lim Lai Cheng, chair­man of the Sin­ga­pore Pos­i­tive Ed­u­ca­tion Net­work (Spen).</p>
    <p>“Con­text, the per­son­al­ity of the child and his/her state of mind mat­ter when we seek ap­proaches to help them over­come set­backs or when we want to mo­ti­vate them,” says Dr Lim, who is also ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of SMU Acad­emy, the pro­fes­sional train­ing arm of Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity (SMU), and a fel­low in its School of So­cial Sciences.</p>
    <p>She gives three sce­nar­ios:</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>THE HARD-WORK­ING CHILD</p>
    <p>Your child is driven and in­de­pen­dent, but un­able to meet his or her de­sired grade, and you do not know why.</p>
    <p>Mrs Chan Wai Leng, year head and school staff de­vel­oper at Gey­lang Methodist School (Pri­mary), ex­plains that there could be ex­ten­u­at­ing fac­tors at play. “Of­ten, as par­ents, we deem low scores as a lack of ef­fort put in by our child. Per­haps this could be a re­sult of the child’s learn­ing method, poor time man­age­ment, teacher’s teach­ing method and ex­ter­nal en­vi­ron­ment that may not lend them­selves con­ducive to his or her deep learn­ing.”</p>
    <p>In such cases, it is im­por­tant to cel­e­brate your child’s com­mit­ment, says Mrs Chan, whose school holds a Par­ent-ChildTeach­er Meet in­stead of the usual par­ent-teacher meet­ings as it be­lieves in giv­ing kids own­er­ship of their learn­ing ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Dr Lim of Spen sug­gests say­ing some­thing like, “I have seen you put in a lot of ef­fort and I am proud of that”, fol­lowed by “let’s find out where you could do bet­ter and we will work at it to­gether”.</p>
    <p>She ex­plains: “This will give the child a lot more as­sur­ance that help is at hand, and that ef­fort is val­ued.”</p>
    <p>Ms Loh of Care Cor­ner adds: “Recog­nise that this is an ex­cep­tional year. If the child typ­i­cally did well pre-Covid-19, un­der­stand that it could just be due to the in­abil­ity to cope with the changes dur­ing this pe­riod.”</p>
    <p>Re­act­ing with tough love may back­fire, says Ms Tan Su-Lynn, a se­nior ed­u­ca­tional psy­chol­o­gist with Prom­ises Health­care.</p>
    <p>Neg­a­tive at­ten­tion from par­ents and teach­ers can de­mor­alise a usu­ally highly mo­ti­vated child, which could lead to poor self­es­teem and other so­cial-emo­tional is­sues in the long term.</p>
    <p>It is also im­por­tant to help your child find some­thing else about school life that he or she en­joys, such as a co-cur­ric­u­lar ac­tiv­ity or strong friend­ships, she adds.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>THE SMART BUT PLAY­FUL CHILD</p>
    <p>If your child has high abil­ity but low will­ing­ness, he or she needs to find mean­ing and pur­pose in aca­demic stud­ies, Dr Lim of Spen says.</p>
    <p>“Get­ting down to what makes math­e­mat­ics in­ter­est­ing or why Chi­nese is worth study­ing will help the child see the rel­e­vance of what he or she is learn­ing and di­rect his or her en­ergy to mas­ter­ing the par­tic­u­lar sub­ject. Build­ing fun around the sub­jects will help, too.”</p>
    <p>She sug­gests look­ing for spon­ta­neous ways to ap­ply what your kids have learnt in school to solve real-world prob­lems.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, at the play­ground, ask your child how many tiles of a cer­tain size you would need to cover that area to en­gage him or her in maths. To make mother tongue more rel­e­vant, ask him or her to or­der food at a restau­rant or food stall and pay the bill, all while us­ing the lan­guage.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>THE UNDIS­CI­PLINED CHILD</p>
    <p>If your kid is not putting in ef­fort and lacks dis­ci­pline, you are not alone.</p>
    <p>Ms Loh of Care Cor­ner re­calls hav­ing to deal with many des­per­ate par­ents dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, who did not have rou­tines for their kids and could not cope with home­based learn­ing and work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>Dr Lim says chil­dren crave bound­aries and struc­ture, which builds char­ac­ter and re­spon­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Be­yond just set­ting up a timetable of daily ac­tiv­i­ties and a dis­trac­tion-free study area, it is use­ful to break up big tasks into smaller tar­gets – ex­perts call this “scaf­fold­ing” – so that your child has fre­quent breaks and feels an “in­cre­men­tal sense of ac­com­plish­ment”, she adds.</p>
    <p>Such ex­trin­sic mo­ti­va­tion (sat­is­fac­tion at achiev­ing a goal) may later turn into in­trin­sic mo­ti­va­tion (study­ing be­cause they want to do bet­ter).</p>
    <p>Of course, par­ents should also look out for learn­ing dis­abil­i­ties in seem­ingly undis­ci­plined kids, so they can get spe­cialised help early, she says.</p>
    <p>Teenagers who lack fo­cus may ben­e­fit from goal set­ting, says Mr Liu Kah Yang, year head of Bart­ley Sec­ondary School.</p>
    <p>He sug­gests that par­ents nav­i­gate the Skill­sFu­ture por­tal (www.skill­sfu­ture.sg) to­gether with their kids to find out about the pro­fes­sions avail­able based on their chil­dren’s per­son­al­ity, in­ter­ests and ex­pec­ta­tions. This helps them re­late their ar­eas of in­ter­est to what they learn in school.</p>
    <p>LEARN­ING FROM FAIL­URE</p>
    <p>What chil­dren need most from their par­ents dur­ing re­port card sea­son is un­con­di­tional love and em­pa­thy so they feel em­pow­ered to keep go­ing rather than give up, ex­perts say.</p>
    <p>Mr Liu of Bart­ley Sec­ondary says: “The Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion has made it a chal­leng­ing year for ev­ery­one. It is thus all the more im­por­tant for par­ents to main­tain pos­i­tive re­la­tion­ships with their chil­dren so that they con­tinue to feel sup­ported.”</p>
    <p>He urges par­ents not to com­pare their child’s per­for­mance with oth­ers, which “pro­motes un­healthy com­pe­ti­tion, and may even re­sult in re­sent­ment”.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan of Prom­ises Health­care says chil­dren also need a safe space to ex­press their feel­ings about learn­ing dif­fi­cul­ties with­out be­ing judged.</p>
    <p>“Lis­ten to them when they are ready to talk, and help them to in­te­grate and con­nect back to calm them­selves down.”</p>
    <p>Teenagers, in par­tic­u­lar, need time and space to process their dis­ap­point­ment, says Ms Loh of Care Cor­ner, so par­ents should not step in too quickly and should al­low them more in­de­pen­dence to make de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>A ro­bust re­la­tion­ship with your child makes dif­fi­cult con­ver­sa­tions eas­ier, she says, but adds that par­ents can­not ex­pect re­sults if they do not put in the hard work first.</p>
    <p>“It is of­ten said that qual­ity time is more im­por­tant than quan­tity. But in our ex­pe­ri­ence of deal­ing with par­ent-child re­la­tion­ships, you can­not get qual­ity time with­out quan­tity.”</p>
    <p>One way to build a stronger bond is to “date” your child, says Mr Eric Neo, 46, co-founder and group chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of in­vest­ment com­pany RF In­ter­na­tional Hold­ings, founder and chair­man of fi­nance and tech­nol­ogy firm Neo & Part­ners Global, and di­rec­tor of RF Fund Man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Be­sides fam­ily out­ings, he makes it a point to take daugh­ter Chloe, 13, and son Sean, seven, out in­di­vid­u­ally about once a month, where they bond over meals that the kids get to choose.</p>
    <p>That “strong com­mu­ni­ca­tion chan­nel” al­lows him to have heartto-heart talks with them, such as the one he had with Chloe when her grades dipped in Term 3 after the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>As she had done well in the first two terms, he told her she had it in her to ex­cel, and that “every­body falls; the key thing is to pick your­self up”.</p>
    <p>“We don’t rep­ri­mand. We try to un­der­stand and we let them know that we un­der­stand the sit­u­a­tion, and en­cour­age them to have the grit to im­prove,” he says.</p>
    <p>HOL­I­DAY HOME­WORK</p>
    <p>No child wants to spend his or her school hol­i­days study­ing, so get your child in­volved in plan­ning his or her daily sched­ule, says Mrs Chan of Gey­lang Methodist School (Pri­mary).</p>
    <p>This helps kids learn about re­spon­si­ble de­ci­sion-mak­ing and they will de­velop own­er­ship of their learn­ing jour­ney, which keeps them mo­ti­vated.</p>
    <p>Drilling through as­sess­ment pa­pers may also be coun­ter­pro­duc­tive, she adds, as “it is more im­por­tant to go through mis­takes made, un­der­stand why that mis­take was made and get the con­cept right. Do­ing more does not nec­es­sar­ily help”.</p>
    <p>Mr Liu of Bart­ley Sec­ondary says older kids can work out their own learn­ing ac­tion plans, while younger ones can choose from op­tions drawn up in con­sul­ta­tion with teach­ers.</p>
    <p>“Based on the child’s ac­tion plan, par­ents can ask guid­ing ques­tions such as, ‘What do you think you can learn from this and do bet­ter?’, ‘How will you go about do­ing it?’ and ‘Who can help you with this?’.</p>
    <p>“Such ques­tions pro­mote a growth mind­set and can help the child see what he or she can do/change to achieve his or her goals,” he says.</p>
    <p>Mrs Chan sug­gests mak­ing sure that there is plenty of time for cour­ses or ac­tiv­i­ties your child likes, space to dream and do noth­ing, as well as op­por­tu­ni­ties to re­con­nect as a fam­ily.</p>
    <p>The long break is also a timely re­minder for par­ents to fo­cus less on marks and more on help­ing kids make their mark in the world.</p>
    <p>As ed­u­ca­tional psy­chol­o­gist Ms Tan puts it: “Suc­cess in life is not just based on school or aca­demic suc­cess, but rather on things like hav­ing a sense of self-worth, the will­ing­ness to ask for and to ac­cept help, the abil­ity to bounce back in the face of ad­ver­sity and to form healthy re­la­tion­ships – val­ues and qual­i­ties that are not quan­tifi­able like exam grades.”</p>
