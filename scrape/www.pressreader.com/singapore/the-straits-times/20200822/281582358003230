    <p>With tourism num­bers down due to the pan­demic, it is time for lo­cal at­trac­tions and hos­pi­tal­ity busi­nesses to go lo­cal and treat the do­mes­tic mar­ket as a vi­able mar­ket, and not as an af­ter­thought, says hos­pi­tal­ity vet­eran Daniel Cheng.</p>
    <p>“The magic down there is so strong,” go the lyrics of a Four Tops hit, but Covid-19 has put paid to the tourism al­lure of Sin­ga­pore and the magic is no more un­til a cure is found for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>With the global econ­omy hit­ting the brakes, un­em­ploy­ment has soared and con­sumer spend­ing nose­dived in tan­dem.</p>
    <p>Tighter wal­lets dras­ti­cally pruned the rev­enues of re­tail­ers.</p>
    <p>Leisure at­trac­tions and ho­tels bear an even greater brunt with the loss of tourists and busi­ness trav­ellers, although ho­tels are earn­ing a bit of respite adapt­ing half of their room in­ven­tory for use as quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>In the 1988 hit Loco In Aca­pulco, Amer­i­can vo­cal group Four Tops crooned on, “your back’s against the wall” – which is lit­er­ally what the leisure and hos­pi­tal­ity in­dus­try is fac­ing right now, with in­ter­na­tional travel at a stand­still, in­stantly re­flected in tourism re­ceipts plum­met­ing al­most 40 per cent in the first quar­ter of this year to $4 bil­lion, and this was still prior to the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the cir­cuit breaker in April, when the full im­pact of the coro­n­avirus had yet to be felt.</p>
    <p>The $27.7 bil­lion tourism tak­ings of the pre­ced­ing year now seemed like a mil­len­nium ago and an unattain­able pipe dream for 2020.</p>
    <p>It is against this back­drop that the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board is spear­head­ing a $45 mil­lion re­dis­cover Sin­ga­pore mar­ket­ing cam­paign to rein­vig­o­rate lo­cal spend­ing in this sec­tor, with pro­mo­tions in din­ing and ho­tel stay­ca­tions for res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat has dou­bled down (more ac­cu­rately – sep­tu­pled) by ex­tend­ing $320 mil­lion worth of tourism cred­its to Sin­ga­pore­ans in the form of Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers vouch­ers to boost do­mes­tic spend­ing.</p>
    <p>It is a band-aid at best, but the ail­ing in­dus­try is wel­com­ing with open flail­ing arms any help tossed its way as many busi­nesses fight for dear life.</p>
    <p>How much these can buf­fer the in­dus­try squarely de­pends on the man­ner the funds are dished out, where the nett spend catal­ysed will be the proof in the pud­ding.</p>
    <p>A best-case sce­nario might see lo­cal con­sumers pony­ing up twice of what is on the ta­ble, re­sult­ing in around a $1 bil­lion spend­ing in­jec­tion into the sec­tor. But that is still a far cry from the pre-Covid-19 tourism space where each of the shop­ping, ac­com­mo­da­tion and at­trac­tion/en­ter­tain­ment seg­ments rang in $5 bil­lion an­nu­ally in the past few years.</p>
    <p>It is thus im­por­tant for busi­nesses to un­der­stand that the Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers hand­out is but a dose of an­tibi­otics to bring down the fever tem­po­rar­ily and not a cure for the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The Four Tops song be­moan­ing the risks of “go­ing loco” (go­ing nuts) is a re­minder that it is im­per­a­tive for the in­dus­try to help it­self and go lo­cal for its sur­vival.</p>
    <p>TOURIST-RE­LIANT BUSI­NESSES SUF­FER</p>
    <p>Like ho­tels, the busi­nesses that are hard­est hit by the pan­demic are those which rely pri­mar­ily on trav­ellers and tourism dol­lars.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus brought the newly minted Jewel Changi Air­port, where seven out of 10 cus­tomers hail from over­seas, to its knees barely a year af­ter open­ing.</p>
    <p>The twin tourism jew­els of Sin­ga­pore are also not spared.</p>
    <p>The Ma­rina Bay Sands and Re­sorts World Sen­tosa (RWS) in­te­grated re­sorts (IRs) en­coun­tered a rare blue moon when the houses turned red in­side the first- and fourth-most prof­itable casi­nos in the world.</p>
    <p>RWS shocked the lo­cal job mar­ket last month when it laid off a quar­ter of its 8,000 em­ploy­ees, unimag­in­able for a cash cow reap­ing hun­dreds of mil­lions of dol­lars in profit ev­ery year since the day the sprawl­ing IR opened its doors to wel­come cus­tomers a decade ago.</p>
    <p>The end of the al­most two-month cir­cuit breaker pe­riod and the grad­ual re­open­ing of the econ­omy did lit­tle to help the cash tills of these tourist-cen­tric busi­nesses, com­pared with other lo­cal-fo­cused es­tab­lish­ments. In re­tail, the crowds are re­turn­ing to the heart­land malls but not so much to the down­town tourist dis­tricts.</p>
    <p>Bus­loads of tourists no longer ply the short bridge to Sen­tosa and the at­trac­tions on the is­land are largely de­serted, with the only throngs of hu­mans seen on the rolling fair­ways of Sen­tosa Golf Club, com­pris­ing golf-starved mem­bers.</p>
    <p>The Chi­na­town streets be­tween Sago Lane and Tem­ple Street are eerily quiet – in­dica­tive of the demise be­falling busi­nesses with all their eggs in the tourism bas­ket.</p>
    <p>Go­ing lo­cal is prov­ing to be the more re­silient theme in these trou­bled times and it would be per­cip­i­ent for busi­nesses bank­ing too heav­ily on for­eign wal­lets to take pause and re­tool their strat­egy to­wards a more ro­bustly bal­anced cus­tomer de­mo­graphic mix.</p>
    <p>A case in point is the casino re­sort across the Cause­way, up in Gent­ing High­lands.</p>
    <p>Since the lift­ing of the move­ment con­trol or­der in June, Re­sorts World Gent­ing has been fac­ing the happy prob­lem of main­tain­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules amid the pent-up de­mand from Malaysians pour­ing through its gates.</p>
    <p>The re­sort counts Malaysians as as im­por­tant a cus­tomer seg­ment as for­eign tourists. De­trac­tors may ar­gue Malaysia has a much larger pop­u­la­tion base of 29.7 mil­lion ci­ti­zens com­pared with Sin­ga­pore, but it is im­por­tant to distin­guish that the over­whelm­ing clien­tele at the hill­top re­sort are Malaysian Chi­nese, who to­tal about 6.7 mil­lion, com­pared with Sin­ga­pore’s pop­u­la­tion of 5.85 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>So why didn’t the two Sin­ga­pore IRs weather Covid-19 as well as the Malaysian re­sort?</p>
    <p>The rea­son is sim­ply that the Malaysian re­sort is cu­rated to serve a more bal­anced cus­tomer de­mo­graphic be­tween lo­cals and for­eign­ers. The Sin­ga­pore IRs are fo­cused much more keenly on for­eign visi­tors and much less so on lo­cals who fancy a wa­ger.</p>
    <p>The lat­ter is ev­i­dent in the park­ing charges at both IRs, which are set ex­or­bi­tantly high to de­ter lo­cals from ca­sual im­pulse vis­its and save the park­ing spa­ces for higher-yield­ing gam­blers and the well-heeled.</p>
    <p>As far as non-gam­bling IR at­trac­tions go, re­peat vis­its to world-class at­trac­tions like Uni­ver­sal Stu­dios Sin­ga­pore gen­er­ally hap­pen when new rides are in­tro­duced but these oc­cur only ev­ery few years, while Cats and other award-win­ning mu­si­cals are not your typ­i­cal av­er­age mid­dle-class Sin­ga­porean fare.</p>
    <p>GO­ING LO­CAL</p>
    <p>The time is nigh for busi­nesses to take stock of their anaemic view of the lo­cal mar­ket as a mere af­ter­thought and re­alise how im­por­tant this base is to tide them over rocky times like this pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Many of the lo­cal at­trac­tions sell kitsch which they now grasp lo­cals do not buy. They could take a leaf from the National Her­itage Board and Wildlife Re­serves Sin­ga­pore, as our museums and national zoo at­tract as many lo­cals as tourists.</p>
    <p>Lo­cals still count for a sig­nif­i­cant 40 per cent go­ing through the turn­stiles of the Sin­ga­pore Zoo and con­sti­tute over 60 per cent of visi­tors at our museums.</p>
    <p>The se­cret to their suc­cess? The lo­cal de­mo­graphic has been a core seg­ment in the con­cep­tu­al­i­sa­tion of their busi­ness plans.</p>
    <p>Ho­tels are now pan­der­ing to lo­cal stay­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>My ad­vice to them is to in­sti­tute this as their per­ma­nent, re­cur­ring strat­egy rather than as a short-term, stop-gap tac­tic.</p>
    <p>Re­tail­ers like­wise need to re­turn to the draw­ing board with their think­ing caps to in­no­vate, rein­vent and be more cre­ative.</p>
    <p>They can ex­plore how they might cap­ture some of the $34 bil­lion that re­pressed Sin­ga­pore­ans splurge an­nu­ally on over­seas travel, short of bring­ing Lon­don, Paris and New York to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>While ex­pe­ri­ences are hard to recre­ate, I re­mem­ber peo­ple lug­ging bag­fuls of Tokyo Banana and Krispy Kreme in plane cab­ins to bring home, be­fore these cov­eted items be­came read­ily avail­able lo­cally. But there are a lot of other goods and ser­vices which have yet to reach our sunny shores, for which we still have to hop onto a plane to get, cre­at­ing a gap that savvy re­tail­ers can fill.</p>
    <p>Sat­is­fy­ing a lit­tle of that ap­petite might war­rant some food for thought as Ama­zon and Shopee only go so far to bridge the void.</p>
    <p>Even size was not an is­sue for some in­no­va­tive heads who had brought in and recre­ated the pop­u­lar Thai out­door Art­box mar­ket and Chatuchak night mar­ket in Sin­ga­pore to great suc­cess.</p>
    <p>With more of such in­ge­nu­ity and out-of-the-box brain­storm­ing, tap­ping lo­cal spend­ing to make up for lost tourism re­ceipts need not in­volve an ex­pen­sive makeover.</p>
    <p>The lo­cal leisure and hos­pi­tal­ity busi­nesses have to ac­cept the Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers pro­gramme and all the govern­ment stim­u­lus pack­ages as the leg-up they are de­signed to be, and it is ul­ti­mately up to them to rein­vent and re­tool their busi­ness mod­els.</p>
    <p>With no free-spend­ing tourists Go­ing Loco with their UnionPay and credit cards and a coro­n­avirus with­out a sell-by date, Go­ing Lo­cal is the only vac­cine that can save the day. • Daniel Cheng is the con­sult­ing prin­ci­pal of Prism & Com­pany and a re­gional leisure and hos­pi­tal­ity in­dus­try pro­fes­sional who for­merly held se­nior ex­ec­u­tive po­si­tions with Hard Rock In­ter­na­tional and the Gent­ing Group.</p>
