    <p>An enor­mous amount of in­ter­na­tional pres­tige, to say noth­ing of profit, awaits the coun­try that first de­vel­ops a Covid-19 vac­cine. This is nat­u­ral. Ear­lier this week, Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin said that Rus­sia had be­come the first coun­try in the world to grant reg­u­la­tory ap­proval to a vac­cine against the disease. This is news that at­tests to the sci­en­tific and tech­no­log­i­cal prow­ess of a tal­ented peo­ple who have reg­is­tered achieve­ments and made his­tory in a wide va­ri­ety of fields over decades – from trans­form­ers and syn­thetic rub­ber to he­li­copters and the launch of Sput­nik 1, the world’s first ar­ti­fi­cial satel­lite. Ap­pro­pri­ately, the vac­cine will be named Sput­nik V. It would be good, in­deed, if a suc­cess­ful vac­cine were to ben­e­fit hu­man­ity in the same way that the satel­lite ex­panded the hori­zons of space ex­plo­ration and re­search for all. But while speed is im­por­tant in dis­cov­er­ing a vac­cine for a disease that has rav­aged lives and economies glob­ally, what is es­sen­tial is that the drug should be ef­fec­tive, tested and safe.</p>
    <p>Con­cerns have emerged over the fact that Moscow’s an­nounce­ment, which paves the way for the mass in­oc­u­la­tion of the Rus­sian pop­u­la­tion, comes after less than two months of hu­man test­ing. Hu­man tri­als are crit­i­cal in as­cer­tain­ing the re­li­a­bil­ity of a vac­cine. This prin­ci­ple ap­plies to all coun­tries and com­pa­nies in the race to pro­duce a vi­able drug. Pop­u­lar ac­cep­tance of vaccinatio­n it­self would be se­verely un­der­mined should an an­ti­dote go wrong by prov­ing to be in­ef­fec­tive or, worse, un­safe. Hence the need for cau­tion.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts, cited in a vac­cine-tracker sur­vey ear­lier this month, es­ti­mate that even a fast-tracked process could pro­pel a vic­to­ri­ous can­di­date to the mar­ket in about 12 to 18 months and that, too, is only if the process pro­ceeds seam­lessly from sci­en­tific con­cep­tion to mar­ket avail­abil­ity. Such a time­frame, and its at­ten­dant caveats, sug­gests just how dif­fi­cult it is to in­vent a vac­cine, test it, pass reg­u­la­tory scru­tiny and ul­ti­mately pro­duce a drug for the mass mar­ket. Thus, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion dis­claims ap­proval or en­dorse­ment of any prod­uct or en­tity men­tioned in its “draft land­scape” of Covid-19 can­di­date vac­cines. The world body needs to stick to cau­tion­ary sci­en­tific ev­i­dence closely in a race in which the quest for fame and profit plays such an im­por­tant part.</p>
    <p>Com­pe­ti­tion is not bad in it­self. Sin­ga­pore, too, is mak­ing progress on this front. The first co­hort of vol­un­teers has been dosed with a vac­cine de­vel­oped jointly by Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School and United States phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany Arc­turus Ther­a­peu­tics. Sin­ga­pore­ans await fur­ther news ea­gerly. Mean­while, ex­pec­ta­tions of a med­i­cal preven­tion should not di­lute so­cial habits that cit­i­zens have de­vel­oped since the disease cut a dread­ful epi­demi­o­log­i­cal and eco­nomic swathe through lives here. Safe dis­tanc­ing and other pre­cau­tions must con­tinue to guide be­hav­iour.</p>
