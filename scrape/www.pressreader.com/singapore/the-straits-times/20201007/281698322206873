    <p>When Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) an­nounced plans for “flights to nowhere” last month, en­vi­ron­men­tal ac­tivists howled in protest.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem of car­bon emis­sions from flights is just the tip of the ice­berg, they said. Pro­duc­ing and later in­cin­er­at­ing used in-flight ameni­ties, such as face masks and sur­face wipes, also add to emis­sions.</p>
    <p>The air­line even­tu­ally scrapped the plan in favour of three al­ter­na­tives: lunch on board an Air­bus A-380 jumbo jet, a tour of its train­ing fa­cil­i­ties, and home de­liv­ery of first and business class meals.</p>
    <p>But Sin­ga­pore­ans need not fret that eat­ing from foil trays in one’s py­ja­mas will be a per­ma­nent state of af­fairs.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung de­liv­ered a min­is­te­rial state­ment on strate­gies to drag the avi­a­tion sec­tor back from the abyss.</p>
    <p>He said that hav­ing reg­is­tered its largest-ever quar­terly loss on record and laid off some 2,000 em­ploy­ees, SIA is “try­ing its best to re­duce cash burn, pre­serve core ca­pa­bil­i­ties, and ex­plore all ways to gen­er­ate rev­enue”.</p>
    <p>Stem­ming the blood­bath have been the Jobs Sup­port Scheme of wage sub­si­dies, cost re­lief through the en­hanced avi­a­tion sup­port pack­age, and tem­po­rary re­de­ploy­ment pro­grammes for af­fected work­ers.</p>
    <p>But the most mean­ing­ful sup­port, said Mr Ong, will be to re­store pas­sen­ger traf­fic and re­vive Sin­ga­pore’s air hub in a con­trolled and safe man­ner.</p>
    <p>Im­proved test­ing and trac­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties mean that the Re­pub­lic can start to re­place eco­nom­i­cally dev­as­tat­ing bor­der clo­sures and stay-home no­tices with tests.</p>
    <p>There are also more coun­tries which are will­ing to ne­go­ti­ate travel bub­ble ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>Bear­ing in mind these im­proved con­di­tions, Mr Ong out­lined sev­eral mea­sures for the fu­ture: pur­sue re­cip­ro­cal green lane ar­range­ments with part­ner coun­tries or re­gions for es­sen­tial travel; fa­cil­i­tate trans­fer pas­sen­gers at Changi Air­port; lift bor­der re­stric­tions to places with com­pre­hen­sive pub­lic health sur­veil­lance sys­tems and com­pa­ra­ble Covid-19 in­ci­dence rates; and ne­go­ti­ate air travel bub­bles for gen­eral trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>But, as he said, SIA is “far from be­ing out of the woods”.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong used a Chi­nese idiom to stress that a sug­ges­tion from As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ja­mus Lim (Sengkang GRC) to im­pose an en­vi­ron­men­tal tax on flights to nowhere was like throw­ing stones at some­one who has al­ready fallen down a well.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter said: “The sim­ple an­swer is this: We’re in a cri­sis. SIA is fer­ry­ing 1.5 per cent of its pas­sen­ger vol­ume. It’s not about pass­ing costs to pas­sen­gers, it’s that there are no pas­sen­gers to pass them to now.</p>
    <p>“SIA would have gone un­der if not for the mas­sive re­cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion ex­er­cise that hap­pened. And there­fore, we need to help SIA pre­serve as much cash as it can.”</p>
    <p>To Mr Liang Eng Hwa’s (Bukit Pan­jang) ques­tion on cost and rev­enue im­pli­ca­tions, Mr Ong ac­knowl­edged that the per-pas­sen­ger cost of run­ning the air­line has risen, thanks to un­der-ca­pac­ity, ex­tra tests and seg­re­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>But there are still many pas­sen­gers who are pre­pared to pay slightly more, he said, even if it means hav­ing to go through the dis­com­fort of be­ing tested.</p>
    <p>“So I think the de­mand is there... and we need to un­lock it.”</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to Ms Poh Li San (Sem­bawang GRC) on whether the au­thor­i­ties will con­sider re­duc­ing the stay-home no­tice pe­riod to three to five days for “safer” coun­tries, he said it is bet­ter to open uni­lat­er­ally to those with sim­i­lar in­fec­tion risk pro­files.</p>
    <p>“Right now is not the time to sim­plify rules or re­view re­quire­ments and ap­ply them gen­er­ally,” he said.</p>
    <p>“What we need to do is to un­der­stand ev­ery coun­try and re­gion, their risk pro­file, and cus­tomise our ap­proach for trav­ellers from each of these coun­tries or re­gions.”</p>
    <p>De­spite dif­fer­ences in pro­posed ap­proaches, one thing re­mains clear: The out­look for the avi­a­tion sec­tor re­mains shaky, de­spite signs of life on do­mes­tic routes in larger mar­kets such as Europe and China.</p>
    <p>Wide-body jets are stand­ing idle, and car­ri­ers such as SIA that rely on in­ter­na­tional trav­ellers and hub air­ports are strug­gling.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Air Trans­port Ac­tion Group, a Geneva-based coali­tion of avi­a­tion in­dus­try or­gan­i­sa­tions, the pan­demic could wipe out 46 mil­lion jobs world­wide. Many in the in­dus­try ex­pect that air travel will not re­cover to last year’s level un­til 2024.</p>
    <p>But this is also an op­por­tu­nity to re­think the in­dus­try’s cor­po­rate struc­ture and en­vi­ron­men­tal foot­print.</p>
    <p>More re­search can be done to re­duce emis­sions, and air­lines can use the cri­sis to make their fleets greener.</p>
    <p>Many are deal­ing with business models that are in­flex­i­ble, held aloft by thin mar­gins.</p>
    <p>Go­ing for­ward, pric­ing in­no­va­tion will be key to keep­ing cus­tomers keen.</p>
    <p>Some have also de­scribed how leas­ing could al­low car­ri­ers more agility to re­spond to de­mand, given the pro­hib­i­tive cap­i­tal costs of ac­quir­ing air­craft.</p>
    <p>With air­lines’ bal­ance sheets in tat­ters and air­ports look­ing like ghost towns, it may seem that the ex­pe­ri­ence of fly­ing will never be the same again.</p>
    <p>Yet avi­a­tion has bounced back from pre­vi­ous crises, in­clud­ing</p>
    <p>9/11. The global econ­omy will con­tinue to need air travel.</p>
    <p>With strong sup­port from Sin­ga­pore­ans and the Gov­ern­ment, there is ev­ery rea­son to be­lieve that SIA will rise from the ashes – and change for the bet­ter in the process.</p>
