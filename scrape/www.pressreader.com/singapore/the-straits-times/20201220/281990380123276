    <p>SANTA ROSA (La­guna) • For over two decades, an amuse­ment park an hour’s drive south of Manila has been a must-stop for fam­i­lies here look­ing for a quick Christ­mas jaunt to re­mem­ber.</p>
    <p>When it opened in 1995, En­chanted King­dom was un­like any other the Philip­pines had ever seen.</p>
    <p>At 16ha, it was larger than any other amuse­ment park at the time. It was not just a hotch­potch of vomit-in­duc­ing me­chan­i­cal rides and car­ni­val games. Its sprawl­ing grounds were di­vided into seven themed sec­tions that co­a­lesced around a story: a Wizard of Oz-like fan­tasy es­cape.</p>
    <p>It was the coun­try’s first true theme park, a skinny ver­sion of Dis­ney­land or Univer­sal Stu­dios.</p>
    <p>Last year, it drew close to two mil­lion vis­i­tors. But then, just as it was putting the fin­ish­ing touches on a year-long, grand cel­e­bra­tion of its 25th an­niver­sary, Covid-19 struck.</p>
    <p>It was shut­tered early this year, along with much of the coun­try, as ev­ery­one grap­pled with the fast-mov­ing, lethal coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>It re­opened in Oc­to­ber, in time for Christ­mas, as the gov­ern­ment eased re­stric­tions for en­ter­tain­ment venues.</p>
    <p>That de­ci­sion did not make much sense, business-wise, be­cause there is still a cap on how many peo­ple can go there on any given day, chil­dren are still barred from go­ing, and the theme park is open only on week­ends.</p>
    <p>It did not help that one typhoon af­ter an­other raced across the Philip­pines each week through much of Oc­to­ber and the whole of last month.</p>
    <p>“But we need this to pre­serve our men­tal health,” said the com­pany’s chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer Cyn­thia Ma­mon.</p>
    <p>In a way, the theme park is a sooth­ing respite from a year blighted by a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines went through one of the long­est and strictest lock­downs in the world early this year, as the num­ber of Covid-19 cases spiked to 200,000, then 400,000.</p>
    <p>The trauma from that ex­pe­ri­ence re­mains raw, even as much of the coun­try stirs back to life and races to­wards some sem­blance of nor­malcy.</p>
    <p>With in­fec­tions fall­ing to be­low 1,500 a day and a death rate of less than 2 per cent in re­cent weeks, the gov­ern­ment has been mov­ing to re­open the econ­omy, put peo­ple back to work and get them to spend once more.</p>
    <p>Tens of thou­sands of fac­tory work­ers are back work­ing at eco­nomic zones in the sub­urbs</p>
    <p>that ring Met­ro­pol­i­tan Manila.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple are flock­ing back to restau­rants, public markets, gyms, spas and sa­lons, and churches. Malls are see­ing a no­tice­able jump in foot traf­fic, from nearly zero dur­ing lock­down. Public trans­port is back up to 50 per cent.</p>
    <p>But the cin­e­mas are still closed. So are bars, dis­cothe­ques, con­cert venues and the­atres.</p>
    <p>While there are plenty of op­por­tu­ni­ties now for so­cial­is­ing, there are so few in the way of pure fun and amuse­ment.</p>
    <p>This is where En­chanted King­dom is try­ing to slide in, of­fer­ing a way to sus­pend our wor­ries, if only mo­men­tar­ily, even as re­al­ity keeps crash­ing into us.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple come here to re­live their happy mem­o­ries – when they pro­posed to their girl­friends or had a great time here with their friends. Com­ing here lets you for­get what we’re go­ing through right now and re­turn to a time when life was more breezy. It gives you a feel­ing that the pan­demic is just a chap­ter in our life,” said the park’s pres­i­dent Mario Ma­mon.</p>
    <p>For now, En­chanted King­dom is open only on Satur­days and</p>
    <p>Sun­days. There is no point in open­ing each day of the week, said Mr Ma­mon.</p>
    <p>He said stu­dents and chil­dren make up a big chunk of En­chanted King­dom’s vis­i­tors: Up to 600,000 stu­dents went on field trips at the park last year. But now, only those above 21 years old can visit the park.</p>
    <p>The park’s grounds are also lim­ited to just 8,000 guests at any given time. At its peak, it had about 20,000 a day. Since it re­opened, it has been get­ting just a thou­sand.</p>
    <p>But the few who have been to the park are all glad they went. Most are in their early 20s. They went there in groups, or as cou­ples on a date.</p>
    <p>“This is the place to be,” Mr Martin Niev­era, 58, one of the Philip­pines’ top singers, told me.</p>
    <p>He said he has been to En­chanted King­dom ev­ery week­end since it re­opened be­cause of his son, who has spe­cial needs.</p>
    <p>“My son re­ally loves it here. He’s a spe­cial boy, and they re­ally take care of him. They don’t spoil him, but it feels like they do. This has ev­ery­thing he likes to do, as far as</p>
    <p>scream­ing goes,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Niev­era said he feels com­pletely safe at the park. “This is one of the few places you can go to where you not only have rules, but you also have peo­ple fol­low­ing them,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Justin Em­paz cer­tainly feels she has noth­ing to fear at the park. She had Covid-19 in Oc­to­ber. It was in­evitable, she said, as she works as an ad­min­is­tra­tive staff mem­ber at a hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>She went to the park to cel­e­brate her 24th birth­day. “I couldn’t have my friends visit my house to cel­e­brate be­cause that would put ev­ery­one at risk,” she said. So, she de­cided to just take along her clos­est friend to En­chanted King­dom.</p>
    <p>“I have very fond mem­o­ries here,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Bing Ledesma, 44, a cor­po­rate sec­re­tary, said she went to En­chanted King­dom with her co-work­ers. “It was a treat from our boss,” she said.</p>
    <p>Her boss wanted to take them some­where more mem­o­rable than a short trip to the mall or lunch at a restau­rant.</p>
    <p>Mr Ma­mon said it has been a very dif­fi­cult year, and he sees the business slog­ging through 2021.</p>
    <p>“We can sur­vive on a week­end oper­a­tion only for one quar­ter… We re­ally need very good re­sults for the Christ­mas hol­i­days, so that we’ll have the band­width to ex­tend to the sum­mer,” he said.</p>
    <p>He is hop­ing the gov­ern­ment will soon al­low those 14 years old and be­low to come to the park, and a vac­cine for Covid-19 will land in the Philip­pines as early as March.</p>
    <p>But he is con­fi­dent that, as in the past 25 years, En­chanted King­dom will over­come the pan­demic. He is, in fact, lay­ing out an am­bi­tious plan to con­vert En­chanted King­dom into a “multi-day des­ti­na­tion”.</p>
    <p>His com­pany is set on ex­pand­ing the park and build­ing lodg­ings and re­tail out­lets around it so that vis­i­tors can stay there not just for a sin­gle day. He is call­ing it an “in­te­grated at­trac­tions des­ti­na­tion”.</p>
    <p>Mr Ma­mon said his fam­ily is in the business for the long haul.</p>
    <p>“If you are an in­vestor and you’re look­ing for a fast buck, this isn’t for you. But if you are able to man­age it prop­erly, the business can tran­scend gen­er­a­tions. We’re still here af­ter 25 years, through thick and thin, and we still are just start­ing on our big plan,” he said.</p>
    <p>My own mem­ory of En­chanted King­dom was not very pleas­ant. De­spite a long-run­ning bout of ver­tigo, I reck­lessly boarded a roller-coaster that had a 360-de­gree loop you pass through first mov­ing for­ward and then back­ward. It was En­chanted King­dom’s crown jewel, and a trip to the park wouldn’t be com­plete with­out rid­ing it.</p>
    <p>I ended up ly­ing on a bench for close to two hours, as my head spun like an out-of-con­trol top. Yet, that mem­ory never went away, and I don’t be­grudge the park for the self-in­flicted tor­ture.</p>
    <p>When I came back years later for this piece, I heard a young man, fresh from a ride that saw him plunge like a fall­ing rock straight to earth and halt sud­denly just be­fore he hit the ground, blurt out: “It was like ev­ery­thing I ate was com­ing out of my mouth.” Yet, he was happy, ea­ger to move on to his next “tor­ture de­vice” of choice.</p>
    <p>It was as Mr Ma­mon said. You come to En­chanted King­dom to cre­ate mem­o­ries you hold on to for when times are just too dif­fi­cult to live through. Like, 2020.</p>
    <p>The park’s grounds are lim­ited to just 8,000 guests at any given time. At its peak, it had about 20,000 vis­i­tors a day. Since it re­opened, it has been get­ting just a thou­sand. But the few who have been to the park are all glad they went. Most are in their early 20s. They went there in groups, or as cou­ples on a date.</p>
