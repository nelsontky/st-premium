    <p>As the year comes to a close, it is time for us to show our grat­i­tude and recog­nise the sac­ri­fices of all front-line work­ers, as they con­tinue to do their jobs dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic de­spite the per­sonal hard­ships and health risks.</p>
    <p>I high­light, in par­tic­u­lar, the heroic ef­forts of our health­care work­ers. Now, more than ever, health­care in­sti­tu­tions need to re­ward their em­ploy­ees on the front lines, as Covid-19 has placed ex­treme stress on the health­care sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Lead­ers of health­care in­sti­tu­tions need to con­sider adapt­ing their op­er­at­ing philoso­phies or poli­cies to sup­port and recog­nise their em­ploy­ees dur­ing this try­ing time.</p>
    <p>They may con­sider pro­vid­ing their em­ploy­ees with some form of hazard pay, or spe­cial in­cen­tives for work­ers with in­creased ex­po­sure to the coro­n­avirus, in­clud­ing spe­cial bonuses or some form of “recog­ni­tion” pay.</p>
    <p>Per­haps the Gov­ern­ment should con­sider in­clud­ing fund­ing for hazard pay in fu­ture stim­u­lus Bills.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers of health­care work­ers could also grant ad­di­tional days of an­nual leave and al­low more days of paid leave for child­care.</p>
    <p>With the in­creased de­mand for health­care pro­fes­sion­als, many of these work­ers are find­ing that they can no longer take their planned an­nual va­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers could con­sider im­ple­ment­ing a sys­tem that gives these work­ers the flex­i­bil­ity to carry over their va­ca­tion time into the fol­low­ing year.</p>
    <p>Also, if there are em­ploy­ees who have put in ex­tra time dur­ing this pan­demic, em­ploy­ers should con­sider pro­vid­ing them with ad­di­tional va­ca­tion time down the road to show ap­pre­ci­a­tion for their sac­ri­fice and ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Lead­ers have the re­spon­si­bil­ity to not only pro­mote ed­u­ca­tion and en­hance com­mu­ni­ca­tion with their teams, but also to sup­port them per­son­ally.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ing learn­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties and cre­at­ing com­mu­ni­ca­tion chan­nels, as well as lend­ing an ear to staff, will en­gage and mo­ti­vate health pro­fes­sion­als in these dif­fi­cult times.</p>
