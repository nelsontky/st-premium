    <p>TOKYO • The Tokyo metropoli­tan govern­ment yes­ter­day con­firmed 95 new daily cases of Covid-19, with the fig­ure drop­ping to the low­est count since July 8.</p>
    <p>The lat­est fig­ure com­pares with 212 new in­fec­tions re­ported on Sun­day and 256 ad­di­tional cases re­ported in the cap­i­tal last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s fig­ure for Tokyo marked the first time since July 8, when 75 cases were con­firmed, that the num­ber of daily in­fec­tions has re­mained below the 100-mark.</p>
    <p>The Tokyo metropoli­tan govern­ment said the cap­i­tal’s cu­mu­la­tive to­tal now stands at 19,428, the high­est among Ja­pan’s 47 pre­fec­tures.</p>
    <p>The na­tion’s to­tal caseload since the out­break be­gan has sur­passed 61,700 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The Tokyo metropoli­tan govern­ment has con­tin­ued to urge res­i­dents to re­frain from trav­el­ling out­side the pre­fec­ture, as well as to avoid din­ing out in groups, even small gath­er­ings held in close prox­im­ity with oth­ers, in a bid to curb the virus’ spread.</p>
    <p>Es­tab­lish­ments serv­ing al­co­hol, such as restau­rants, bars and karaoke par­lours, have been re­quested to shorten their open­ing hours un­til the end of this month.</p>
    <p>They have been asked to shut their doors at 10pm to limit the num­ber of pa­trons drink­ing into the night as another means to try and limit the virus’ spread as peo­ple’s in­hi­bi­tions tend to lower once in­tox­i­cated, in­clud­ing mask wear­ing and main­tain­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>The metropoli­tan govern­ment has de­scribed the sit­u­a­tion in the cap­i­tal of 14 mil­lion as “ex­tremely se­vere” and has said that “ut­most cau­tion is still re­quired” while main­tain­ing its alert level at the high­est on its four-tier scale – mean­ing “in­fec­tions are spread­ing”.</p>
