    <p>In a first, an adult has been con­victed of of­fer­ing drugs to three ju­ve­niles last year, two of whom were 14 years old at the time, while the third was 13.</p>
    <p>Noor Fad­hi­lah Azlan had al­lowed the three sec­ondary school stu­dents to con­sume metham­phetamine, a drug also known as Ice.</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old’s of­fences came to light af­ter of­fi­cers from the Cen­tral Nar­cotics Bureau (CNB) raided her Bukit Ba­tok West res­i­dence and ar­rested the four in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>Noor was yes­ter­day sen­tenced to jail for seven years and nine months, and given a fine of $10,300.</p>
    <p>She had pleaded guilty to three drug-re­lated charges, in­clud­ing one count of per­mit­ting a per­son un­der 21 to con­sume a drug in her pos­ses­sion, and three charges in­volv­ing duty-un­paid cig­a­rettes.</p>
    <p>Eight other charges – of which five are drug-re­lated and three in­volve con­tra­band cig­a­rettes – were taken into con­sid­er­a­tion by Dis­trict Judge Kan Shuk Weng dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>Noor’s case is the first in Sin­ga­pore where a per­son has been con­victed of per­mit­ting an in­di­vid­ual un­der 21 to con­sume a drug in one’s pos­ses­sion.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments, Noor was liv­ing with her two chil­dren in a rented bed­room of a flat in Bukit Ba­tok West Av­enue 4 at the time of her of­fences on Sept 24 last year.</p>
    <p>The chil­dren’s ages were not stated in court doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Noor, who was ped­dling con­tra­band cig­a­rettes, turned to drug traf­fick­ing as a means of earn­ing fast cash.</p>
    <p>She would ob­tain pre-packed Ice through dead drops around her es­tate.</p>
    <p>She then sold the drug to cus­tomers ac­cord­ing to the prices fixed by the sup­plier.</p>
    <p>At about midnight on Sept 24 last year, Noor was smok­ing Ice in the bed­room when she de­cided to of­fer the drug to the three teenagers. They can­not be iden­ti­fied as they are below 18.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Melina Chew said that the teens, who would fre­quently hang out in the bed­room, had been stay­ing over for sev­eral days.</p>
    <p>Two of them be­came ac­quainted with Noor through her sale of con­tra­band cig­a­rettes. One of the two, a 14-year-old, had also pur­chased Ice from her on pre­vi­ous oc­ca­sions.</p>
    <p>“When they in­di­cated that they wished to smoke Ice, the ac­cused per­mit­ted them to do so in the bed­room and pro­ceeded to share her smok­ing uten­sil with them, with ev­ery­one tak­ing turns to take puffs from the smok­ing uten­sil,” the pros­e­cu­tor said.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tor added that the teens did not pay Noor for the Ice they had con­sumed.</p>
    <p>CNB of­fi­cers raided the flat the next day and ar­rested the four in­di­vid­u­als as well as two men – No­raidil Supri and Muham­mad Sharil Ideres, both 37 – who were at the res­i­dence to pur­chase Ice from Noor.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments did not state if the men have been dealt with.</p>
    <p>The CNB of­fi­cers also found 55 car­tons and six pack­ets of duty-un­paid cig­a­rettes in Noor’s bed­room.</p>
    <p>The court heard that this was not the first time con­tra­band cig­a­rettes had been found in the flat.</p>
    <p>Cus­toms of­fi­cers had dis­cov­ered 93 pack­ets of duty-un­paid cig­a­rettes in a raid of the unit a week ear­lier, af­ter they had spot­ted Noor hand­ing over pack­ets of cig­a­rettes to two 14-year-old boys – who were not iden­ti­fied in the court doc­u­ments – near the flat.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Dis­trict Judge Kan granted Noor’s re­quest to de­fer her jail term to Oct 9, so that she can set­tle her per­sonal af­fairs.</p>
    <p>For her of­fence of per­mit­ting a per­son un­der 21 to con­sume a drug in her pos­ses­sion, Noor could have been jailed for up to 10 years.</p>
    <p>Eight other charges – of which five are drug-re­lated and three in­volve con­tra­band cig­a­rettes – were taken into con­sid­er­a­tion by Dis­trict Judge Kan Shuk Weng dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
