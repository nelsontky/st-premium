    <p>NEW YORK • Con­sumers stick­ing close to home as Covid-19 cases spike around the world are reach­ing for more pantry sta­ples such as may­on­naise and peanut but­ter and are buy­ing ro­bot vac­uum clean­ers and com­put­ers.</p>
    <p>As com­pa­nies re­port quar­terly earn­ings and look to the sec­ond half of the year, pan­demic win­ners and losers are be­com­ing more ap­par­ent.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies that sell elec­tron­ics, com­fort food and other prod­ucts for the home con­tinue to ben­e­fit from quar­an­tines and lock­downs.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing at home – or at least out of their nor­mal rou­tines – the ma­jor­ity of the day, con­sumers are em­brac­ing tech­nolo­gies that en­hance their at-home life­style, whether through en­ter­tain­ment or as­sis­tance with chores around the house,” said Mr Daniel Binder, part­ner at Colum­bus Con­sult­ing, a firm that ad­vises on the re­tail sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Last week, elec­tron­ics re­tailer Best Buy said its on­line sales jumped more than three-fold in the cur­rent quar­ter through July 18, while over­all sales rose about 15 per cent. And Roomba ro­bot vac­uum maker iRobot flagged mean­ing­ful growth in de­mand for its vac­u­ums that can cost US$800 (S$1,100).</p>
    <p>Room­bas, which can speak more than a dozen lan­guages in­clud­ing Man­darin, au­to­mat­i­cally zip around car­pets and floors suck­ing up crumbs, dirt and pet hair.</p>
    <p>Keep­ing a clean home has taken on greater promi­nence in the pan­demic, Mr Colin An­gle, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of iRobot, said in the com­pany’s earn­ings re­lease last Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Shares of Best Buy, the Min­neapo­lis-based re­tailer, rose to a record high of US$99.42 last Wed­nes­day, af­ter the com­pany re­ported ro­bust sales of com­put­ers, tablets and ap­pli­ances to home­bound con­sumers and stu­dents. Al­most all its stores had re­opened to shop­pers as of last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple see get­ting a Roomba to get their houses cleaner or up­grad­ing to the lat­est iPhone as a means of get­ting back some sense of con­trol in their lives,” said Mr Dave Mar­cotte, se­nior vice-pres­i­dent, In­sights, at re­tail con­sult­ing and an­a­lyt­ics com­pany Kan­tar.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain-based home im­prove­ment re­tailer King­fisher last Wed­nes­day re­ported ex­cep­tion­ally strong de­mand for do-it-your­self and gar­den­ing prod­ucts. Lock­downs drove a 21.6 per cent jump in sec­ond-quar­ter same-store sales.</p>
    <p>FEEL-GOOD FOOD</p>
    <p>JM Smucker, which makes Smucker’s jams, Jif peanut but­ter and pet food, raised its div­i­dend in a time when many com­pa­nies are slash­ing pay­outs to con­serve cash. Last month, Smucker said it con­tin­ued to ex­pect shop­pers to eat more meals at home.</p>
    <p>Global con­sumer prod­ucts com­pany Unilever last Thurs­day noted strong sales of Brey­ers, Mag­num and Klondike ice cream, along with Hell­mann’s may­on­naise and Knorr soups.</p>
    <p>“We see no signs of North Amer­ica slow­ing down,” Mr Alan Jope, the com­pany’s chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer, told an­a­lysts.</p>
    <p>A new wave of ama­teur bak­ers has led to a surge of more than 40 per cent in sales of Her­shey’s cho­co­late chips and co­coa pow­der that are used in cakes, cook­ies and other desserts.</p>
    <p>The cho­co­late maker said last Thurs­day it ex­pects sales to ac­cel­er­ate in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>By con­trast, jeans maker Levi Strauss & Co said last Tues­day its ex­ec­u­tives would con­tinue to work with re­duced salaries through the end of next month, cit­ing the eco­nomic hit from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Levis, hurt by store clo­sures, said on July 7 that sales tum­bled 62 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
