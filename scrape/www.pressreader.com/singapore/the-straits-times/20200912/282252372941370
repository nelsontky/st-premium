    <p>Body: 1.1cm; coated with blue hair and black pat­terns.</p>
    <p>The bee is at­tracted to plants like the In­dian snake­weed. It sneaks into the nest of the sunda blue-banded dig­ger bee to lay its eggs. When its young emerges, it de­stroys the host’s eggs. As pig­ment is not re­spon­si­ble for its blue colour, its colour will not fade. A 100-year-old spec­i­men will re­main as bril­liantly blue.</p>
    <p>BLUE-SIDED CAR­PEN­TER BEE</p>
    <p>Body: 1.9cm; head, tho­rax and sides of the ab­domen are cov­ered with dense, furry blue hair. Its black wings glim­mer with vi­o­let iri­des­cence.</p>
    <p>This species is rarely seen. The few lo­cal sight­ings were in forests along the South­ern Ridges. But a nest in a woody stem was found up north in Ad­mi­ralty Park.</p>
    <p>BROAD-HEADED LEAF­CUT­TER BEE</p>
    <p>Body: 1.2cm; head and tho­rax are cov­ered with fiery or­ange-red hair.</p>
    <p>This lo­cally wide­spread bee is found in rooftop gar­dens, beaches and man­groves. It is par­tial to the pollen from legumes and the daisy-like aster flower. It has been found liv­ing in man-made bee ho­tels fur­nished with tiny pieces of leaves that it cuts and car­ries home.</p>
