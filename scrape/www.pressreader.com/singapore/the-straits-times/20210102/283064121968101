    <p>In the first ma­jor celebrity news of the new year, hit ro­man­tic K-drama Crash Land­ing On You’s (2019 to 2020) on-screen cou­ple Son Ye-jin and Hyun Bin have ad­mit­ted to be­ing an item in real life as well.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to South Korean en­ter­tain­ment news site Soompi, the stars’ re­spec­tive agen­cies confirmed that Son and Hyun Bin, whose real name is Kim Taepyung, “met through their projects and, af­ter the end of their drama, their pos­i­tive feel­ings to­wards each other de­vel­oped into a ro­man­tic re­la­tion­ship”.</p>
    <p>Son posted on her In­sta­gram af­ter the news broke. She wrote: “Ap­pear­ing in front of all of you with news about my per­sonal life in­stead of work for the first time, I won­der why I feel so em­bar­rassed.”</p>
    <p>She added: “I’m thank­ful to have met a good per­son and I’ll work hard (on the re­la­tion­ship).”</p>
    <p>The A-list cou­ple, both 38, pre­vi­ously starred in the film The Ne­go­ti­a­tion (2018) be­fore re­unit­ing for last year’s wildly pop­u­lar drama Crash Land­ing On You – about a South Korean heiress who falls in love with a North Korean sol­dier.</p>
    <p>The news broke af­ter South Korean tabloid Dis­patch – known for ex­pos­ing celebrity re­la­tion­ships on the first day of the new year – pub­lished a re­port with pho­tos of Son get­ting into Hyun Bin’s car.</p>
    <p>The re­port added that though the stars have been ru­moured to be dat­ing since first work­ing to­gether on crime thriller The Ne­go­ti­a­tion, they be­gan to do so in earnest only af­ter wrap­ping Crash Land­ing On You – some time in March last year.</p>
    <p>They were spot­ted go­ing to a su­per­mar­ket in the United States to­gether in early 2019, but their agen­cies clar­i­fied then that they were friends and not dat­ing.</p>
    <p>Son and Hyun Bin – who have been pop­u­lar lead­ing stars in South Korea for more than a decade – have kept a largely low pro­file re­gard­ing their love life de­spite their fair share of dat­ing ru­mours.</p>
    <p>While Son’s ro­man­tic his­tory is a bit of a mys­tery, Hyun Bin dated fel­low A-lis­ter Song Hye-kyo (Descen­dants Of The Sun, 2016) for about two years af­ter they worked to­gether on the se­ries Worlds Within (2008). The pair broke up in 2011.</p>
