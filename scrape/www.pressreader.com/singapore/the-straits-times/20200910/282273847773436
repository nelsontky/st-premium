    <p>In­vestors piled into shares of Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries on the counter’s first day of trad­ing ex­clud­ing en­ti­tle­ments, while its marine arm’s stock tum­bled.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Sem­b­corp climbed to trade at $1.17 as at 11am, with 32.3 mil­lion shares chang­ing hands, mak­ing it the sec­ond-most heav­ily traded by value on the Sin­ga­pore bourse for the morn­ing.</p>
    <p>The counter closed yes­ter­day at $1.17 with about 50.6 mil­lion shares traded.</p>
    <p>Its lat­est price is 21.6 per cent above its the­o­ret­i­cal price ex-en­ti­tle­ments of around 96.2 cents, cal­cu­lated based on the stock’s clos­ing price of $1.91 on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The con­glom­er­ate on Mon­day said its share­hold­ers would re­ceive 4.911 Sem­b­corp Marine (Sem­bMarine) shares for each Sem­b­corp share held.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Sem­bMarine tum­bled 8.8 per cent to trade at 17.6 cents yes­ter­day as at 11am. It re­cov­ered some ground to end the day 1.6 per cent lower at 19 cents.</p>
    <p>The counter clocked the high­est vol­ume traded on the bourse, with about 209 mil­lion shares chang­ing hands.</p>
    <p>Share­hold­ers last month gave the green light for Sem­bMarine and its par­ent Sem­b­corp to pro­ceed with their two-part pro­posal, which in­cludes a de­merger.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts have said that Sem­b­corp now looks more at­trac­tive with­out</p>
    <p>Sem­bMarine weigh­ing it down, es­pe­cially when eval­u­ated against some of its peers.</p>
    <p>Based on Sem­b­corp’s clos­ing price on Tues­day, the stock has gained 3.2 per cent since share­hold­ers ap­proved the de­merger on Aug 11, and an­a­lysts are ex­pect­ing more gains over the next 12 months. Nine of the 11 calls for Sem­b­corp are “buy” calls, ac­cord­ing to Bloomberg data.</p>
    <p>CGS-CIMB an­a­lyst Lim Siew Khee told The Busi­ness Times: “Rel­a­tive to pure play power names, Sem­b­corp is more di­ver­si­fied and also op­er­ates in dif­fer­ent mar­kets in ad­di­tion to a va­ri­ety of prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>“It is not easy to com­pare them with re­gional peers but given that they are now con­sid­ered as a purer play in the mar­ket, in­vestors could start to give them that credit.”</p>
