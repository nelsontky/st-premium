    <p>ROME • Wayde van Niek­erk, the 400m world record holder, has tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus, ac­cord­ing to Ital­ian daily Gazzetta dello Sport on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The South African, who has been in quar­an­tine since ar­riv­ing in Italy on July 19 on a spe­cial flight, was sup­posed to run in the 100m and 400m at the Tri­este Meet, which would have been his first com­pe­ti­tion out­side his home­land since 2017.</p>
    <p>His man­ager Peet van Zyl was shocked, say­ing: “I don’t know how it’s pos­si­ble. Wayde has been train­ing for the whole week and never had any symp­tom, not even af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive. He hasn’t had a fever.</p>
    <p>“We’ve al­ways been iso­lated, we’ve never been with other peo­ple, we have a ho­tel floor just for us, we only left the ho­tel to go to the track.”</p>
    <p>He also told Gazzetta: “In the last 14 days, each of us has been tested four times, the last one was on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“This af­ter­noon (Fri­day), we were asked to be tested again, we want to make sure to be safe and we are wait­ing for the re­sults.”</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old van Niek­erk clocked a record 43.03 sec­onds to win the 400m gold at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games but has been out of ac­tion since 2017 with a knee in­jury.</p>
