    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong’s Ap­ple Daily has re­sponded with de­fi­ance to the ar­rest of owner Jimmy Lai un­der a new national se­cu­rity law im­posed by Beijing, vow­ing to fight on in a front-page head­line yes­ter­day over an im­age of Lai in hand­cuffs.</p>
    <p>Read­ers had queued to get copies of the pro-democ­racy tabloid, fol­low­ing a raid of its of­fices by po­lice on Mon­day. They also took Lai into de­ten­tion – the high­est-pro­file ar­rest un­der the national se­cu­rity law im­posed on Hong Kong on June 30.</p>
    <p>“Ap­ple Daily must fight on”, the front-page head­line read, amid fears that the new law erodes me­dia free­doms in the semi-au­ton­o­mous ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>“The prayers and en­cour­age­ment of many read­ers and writers make us be­lieve that as long as there are read­ers, there will be writers, and that Ap­ple Daily shall cer­tainly fight on,” it said.</p>
    <p>More than 500,000 copies were printed, against the usual 100,000, the pa­per said on its web­site.</p>
    <p>Main­land-born Lai, who was smug­gled into Hong Kong on a fish­ing boat when he was a pen­ni­less 12-year-old, is one of the most prom­i­nent democ­racy ac­tivists in the Chi­nese-ruled city and an ar­dent critic of Com­mu­nist Party rule in Beijing.</p>
    <p>His ar­rest comes amid a crack­down on the pro-democ­racy op­po­si­tion in Hong Kong that has drawn in­ter­na­tional crit­i­cism and raised fears for the free­doms promised by Beijing when the for­mer Bri­tish colony was re­turned to China’s rule in 1997.</p>
    <p>The national se­cu­rity law pun­ishes any act that China con­sid­ers se­ces­sion, sub­ver­sion, ter­ror­ism or col­lu­sion with for­eign forces with up to life in prison.</p>
    <p>The city’s gov­ern­ment and Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties say the law is nec­es­sary to re­store or­der af­ter months of of­ten vi­o­lent anti-gov­ern­ment protests last year, sparked by fears that China was slowly erod­ing the city’s free­doms.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong has since be­come an­other source of con­tention be­tween the United States and China, whose re­la­tions were al­ready at their most strained in years over var­i­ous is­sues, in­clud­ing trade, the han­dling of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, China’s treat­ment of its Uighur Mus­lim mi­nor­ity and its claims in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo on Mon­day called Lai a “pa­triot”, say­ing Beijing had “evis­cer­ated” Hong Kong’s free­doms.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain said Lai’s ar­rest was fur­ther ev­i­dence that the se­cu­rity law was a “pre­text to si­lence op­po­si­tion”, to which China’s em­bassy replied by urg­ing Lon­don to stop “us­ing free­dom of the press as an ex­cuse to dis­credit” the law.</p>
    <p>Po­lice de­tained Lai, 71, for sus­pected col­lu­sion with for­eign forces af­ter about 200 of­fi­cers searched the news­pa­per’s of­fices, col­lect­ing 25 boxes of ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>Hand­cuffed and ap­par­ently wear­ing the same clothes af­ter spend­ing the night in jail, Lai was driven by po­lice yes­ter­day to his yacht which po­lice searched, me­dia footage showed.</p>
    <p>Beijing has la­belled Lai a “traitor” in the past and is­sued a state­ment sup­port­ing his ar­rest.</p>
    <p>The Beijing-backed China Daily news­pa­per said in an editorial that Lai’s ar­rest showed “the cost of dancing with the en­emy”. The pa­per added that “jus­tice de­layed didn’t mean the ab­sence of jus­tice”.</p>
    <p>Po­lice ar­rested 10 peo­ple in all on Mon­day, in­clud­ing other Ap­ple Daily ex­ec­u­tives and 23-year-old Agnes Chow, one of the for­mer lead­ers of ac­tivist Joshua Wong’s De­mo­sisto pro-democ­racy group. The group was dis­banded be­fore the new law came into force.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s pro-democ­racy move­ment has man­aged to sus­tain broad sup­port across the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Shares in Next Dig­i­tal, which pub­lishes Ap­ple Daily, surged for a sec­ond day, gain­ing more than 2,078 per cent from last Fri­day’s close, af­ter on­line pro-democ­racy fo­rums called on in­vestors to show their sup­port.</p>
    <p>Its mar­ket value rose as high as HK$5.17 bil­lion (S$914 mil­lion), from some HK$200 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>In the work­ing-class neigh­bour­hood of Mong Kok, dozens of peo­ple queued from as early as 2am to buy Lai’s pa­per.</p>
    <p>In an­other show of sup­port, long queues formed at lunch time at the Cafe Sea­sons restau­rant owned by Lai’s son, Ian, who was also ar­rested on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton last week im­posed sanc­tions on 11 top Hong Kong of­fi­cials over what it said was their role in cur­tail­ing po­lit­i­cal free­doms in the city. China re­sponded on Mon­day with sanc­tions on 11 top US leg­is­la­tors and oth­ers.</p>
