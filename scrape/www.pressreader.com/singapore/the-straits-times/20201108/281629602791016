    <p>There were seven new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed as at noon yes­ter­day. All of them were im­ported.</p>
    <p>They were placed on stay­home no­tices on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>There were no new cases in the com­mu­nity or from work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries, for the sec­ond day in a row.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s new cases take Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,054.</p>
    <p>Among the seven im­ported cases, two are Sin­ga­pore­ans – a 59-year-old woman who had been to the United King­dom, and a 46-year-old man who had trav­elled to Canada.</p>
    <p>An­other is a per­ma­nent res­i­dent, a 55-year-old woman who had been to South Korea.</p>
    <p>Two of the new cases are cur­rently em­ployed here – a 28-year-old male work pass holder who ar­rived from the Nether­lands, and a 36-year-old male work per­mit holder who came from Malaysia.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing two cases are short-term visit pass hold­ers.</p>
    <p>One, a 69-year-old woman, was per­mit­ted en­try into Sin­ga­pore from the United King­dom to visit her child, who is a per­ma­nent res­i­dent.</p>
    <p>The other is a 25-year-old man who ar­rived from Ukraine to board a ship docked here as a crew mem­ber.</p>
    <p>Of the new cases, five are asymp­to­matic and were de­tected from MOH’s proac­tive screen­ing and sur­veil­lance, while two were symp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said that all iden­ti­fied close con­tacts of the cases have been iso­lated and quar­an­tined. They will be tested at the start and end of their quar­an­tine pe­riod to de­tect asymp­to­matic cases.</p>
    <p>MOH will also con­duct sero­log­i­cal tests for the close con­tacts to de­ter­mine if the cases could have been in­fected by them.</p>
    <p>The min­istry also said that the clus­ter in Westlite Toh Guan Dor­mi­tory at 18 Toh Guan Road East has been closed, as there have been no new cases linked to it for two in­cu­ba­tion pe­ri­ods, or 28 days.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with one such case in the past week who is cur­rently un­linked.</p>
    <p>With nine cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,953 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 34 pa­tients re­main in hospi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 24 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 28 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
