    <p>The char­ac­ter of Lin­coln Rhyme, a quad­ri­plegic de­tec­tive who chases se­rial killers, will be no stranger to fans of Jef­fery Deaver’s crime nov­els.</p>
    <p>But the last time he was spot­ted on screen was in The Bone Col­lec­tor, the 1999 film based on the Deaver book of the same name star­ring Den­zel Wash­ing­ton and An­gelina Jolie.</p>
    <p>Now, the wheel­chair-us­ing foren­sics ex­pert is fi­nally get­ting his own tele­vi­sion show, Lin­coln Rhyme: Hunt For The Bone Col­lec­tor. New episodes air ev­ery Tues­day at 9.45pm on AXN (Singtel TV Chan­nel 304 and StarHub TV Chan­nel 511).</p>
    <p>The story be­gins with a new mur­der point­ing to the resur­fac­ing of the Bone Col­lec­tor, one of the most in­fa­mous se­rial killers still at large in the United States.</p>
    <p>De­spite an ac­ci­dent on the job leav­ing him paral­ysed, Rhyme (Russell Hornsby), a New York City po­lice de­tec­tive, at­tempts to track him down once and for all. Help­ing him is rookie of­fi­cer Amelia Sachs (Arielle Kebbel), who be­comes the Wat­son to his Sher­lock.</p>
    <p>For Hornsby, the chal­lenge was im­bu­ing the char­ac­ter – a bril­liant crim­i­nol­o­gist with an ego to match – with an un­shake­able con­fi­dence de­spite his lim­ited abil­ity to move.</p>
    <p>And the ac­tor did this by chan­nelling his own up­bring­ing, the­atre back­ground and a sort of hip-hop at­ti­tude, he says.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to re­porters in Los An­ge­les, Hornsby – a clas­si­cally trained stage per­former who has ap­peared in films such as The Hate U Give (2018) and the fan­tasy se­ries Grimm (2011 to 2017) – says his thes­pian back­ground proved in­valu­able.</p>
    <p>“In the­atre train­ing, the first thing they teach you is to stand flat­footed on the stage and let the words work for you.</p>
    <p>“And be­cause of my con­ser­va­tory train­ing at Bos­ton Univer­sity, you’re steeped in Shake­speare, and Shake­speare is about stand­ing still on the stage and pre­sent­ing the text,” says the 46-year-old.</p>
    <p>The main qual­ity he wanted to give Rhyme was a cer­tain con­fi­dence or “swag­ger” and the ac­tor looked to his own back­ground for some of this.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing a black man from Oak­land, Cal­i­for­nia, and raised in hiphop, we lend our­selves to the idea of swag­ger – how one walks and ev­ery­thing like that,” he says.</p>
    <p>“Lin­coln has a cere­bral swag­ger and that’s why I’m us­ing Shake­speare as a model. It’s how he colours his words, his em­pha­sis, where he takes pauses and beats, be­cause that’s very the­atri­cal.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause Lin­coln can’t move, he has to use a the­atri­cal tone as em­pha­sis to help tell the story. So you’ll hear, in a sense, a height­ened</p>
    <p>Lin­coln. It’s a height­ened lan­guage and that’s pur­pose­ful.”</p>
    <p>The se­ries makes a few tweaks to the source ma­te­rial, the best­selling novel The Bone Col­lec­tor, which has in­spired more than a dozen se­quels.</p>
    <p>One that might dis­ap­point fans of the books and the film is the de­ci­sion to kill any hint of ro­mance be­tween Rhyme and Sachs, with the show in­stead hint­ing at the pos­si­bil­ity that Rhyme might rec­on­cile with his ex-wife.</p>
    <p>And un­like in the novel, Rhyme will not be sui­ci­dal over the ac­ci­dent that left him dis­abled be­cause that seemed too dark a place to be­gin the show, its pro­duc­ers say.</p>
    <p>The story has also been up­dated for the 21st cen­tury, with Rhyme get­ting more toys to play with than he did in the 1990s, when the tools avail­able to a wheel­chair-us­ing de­tec­tive were less ad­vanced.</p>
    <p>Hornsby says the new tech­nolo­gies that have arisen in the two decades since “change his sit­u­a­tion im­mensely”.</p>
    <p>This is one rea­son Rhyme is more mo­bile than in pre­vi­ous it­er­a­tions of the story. “From episode 1 to episode 2, Lin­coln goes from the bed to a wheel­chair, and that kind of me­chan­i­cal wheel­chair wasn’t re­ally there to the same de­gree 20 years ago.”</p>
    <p>And as with the BBC’s 2010 to 2017 Sher­lock se­ries star­ring Bene­dict Cum­ber­batch, mod­ern technology will “en­hance the vis­ual ca­pa­bil­i­ties” of the show, Hornsby adds.</p>
    <p>“We’re in a vis­ual medium, so when you talk about Lin­coln’s ge­nius, now, in­stead of telling you how bril­liant he is, we can show you us­ing com­puter graph­ics to en­hance the sto­ry­telling and give peo­ple a rea­son to lean into what they’re watch­ing.”</p>
    <p>New episodes of Lin­coln Rhyme: Hunt For The Bone Col­lec­tor air ev­ery Tues­day at 9.45pm on</p>
    <p>AXN (Singtel TV Chan­nel 304 and StarHub TV Chan­nel 511).</p>
