    <p>A syn­di­cate which police said ap­peared to have a wide net­work of lo­cal and for­eign branches had al­legedly sold fake ha­lal meat for 40 years.</p>
    <p>The group brought in meat from non-ha­lal cer­ti­fied sources, in­clud­ing Brazil, Canada, China and Ukraine, lo­cal news re­ports said.</p>
    <p>Govern­ment of­fi­cers were al­legedly bribed with money and sex to al­low the prod­ucts, in­clud­ing po­ten­tially diseased kan­ga­roo and horse meat, to be sold as ha­lal beef.</p>
    <p>The scan­dal has sparked an in­ves­ti­ga­tion in neigh­bour­ing Sin­ga­pore, to check if the alleged fake ha­lal meat had been sold in the city state.</p>
    <p>Malaysian police said last week they would probe those in­volved in ac­quir­ing, stor­ing, pro­cess­ing and smug­gling, as well as any­one who con­spired to bring in the frozen meat us­ing ap­proved per­mits.</p>
    <p>The Do­mes­tic Trade and Con­sumer Af­fairs Min­istry had de­nied in Par­lia­ment that the syn­di­cate had been op­er­at­ing for 40 years and said meat seized from raids was tested and confirmed not to con­tain any kan­ga­roo, horse or pork.</p>
