    <p>When Mr Xi Jin­ping vis­ited Wash­ing­ton as China’s vice-pres­i­dent on Valen­tine’s Day in 2012, there was no brew­ing bromance.</p>
    <p>His coun­ter­part from the United States then, Mr Joe Bi­den, feted him at a wel­com­ing ban­quet, but pressed him on hu­man rights. It was tan­ta­mount to a di­plo­matic slap, as Bei­jing prefers talk­ing about the is­sue be­hind closed doors.</p>
    <p>With­out sin­gling out any coun­try, a com­posed Mr Xi re­torted at the ban­quet: “There is no best hu­man rights in the world, only bet­ter hu­man rights.”</p>
    <p>The re­but­tal was mea­sured. But it may have been lost in trans­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The un­mixed mes­sage: The US has no busi­ness lec­tur­ing China as Amer­ica’s own record is not the best in the world. On the other hand, China’s record has be­come bet­ter since the Com­mu­nist Party swept to power in 1949.</p>
    <p>The US may see the world in bi­nary op­po­sites, but for China, there are mul­ti­ple shades of grey.</p>
    <p>The US may not agree with Mr Xi’s view on hu­man rights, but he was not fac­tu­ally wrong. For decades, China’s def­i­ni­tion of hu­man rights has been sub­sis­tence rights – feed­ing and cloth­ing more than one bil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>China em­barked on eco­nomic re­forms and gave its cit­i­zens eco­nomic rights to en­rich them­selves only four decades ago. China aims to erad­i­cate ru­ral poverty by the end of this year.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi, who be­came pres­i­dent in 2013, and Mr Bi­den, who nar­rowly de­feated in­cum­bent Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump in the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion on Nov 3, will spar over the next four years over a plethora of is­sues – from hu­man rights abuses in Xin­jiang and Hong Kong to the Covid-19 pan­demic, trade, tech, Tai­wan, Ti­bet and the dis­puted South China Sea.</p>
    <p>“If Bi­den wants to talk, we are will­ing to sit down for talks. If he wants to con­tinue Trump’s fight, we are not afraid of a fight,” a Com­mu­nist Party in­sider told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>He was re­fer­ring to Mr Trump’s threats to de­cou­ple the world’s two big­gest economies, de­clare a fi­nan­cial war, delist Chi­nese com­pa­nies in the US and slap fur­ther sanc­tions over Xin­jiang and Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>“Bi­den will be re­spect­ful and rea­son­able com­pared with Trump, but US pol­icy to­wards China will not change 180 de­grees overnight,” the source said, re­quest­ing anonymity.</p>
    <p>There is a con­sen­sus in the two houses of Congress, and be­tween Democrats and Repub­li­cans, that China is a strate­gic com­peti­tor that needs to be dealt with.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese and Amer­i­cans’ vastly dif­fer­ing val­ues mean it would be dif­fi­cult, if not im­pos­si­ble, for Mr Bi­den to to­tally re­set bi­lat­eral re­la­tions which Mr Trump plunged to their low­est ebb since nor­mal­i­sa­tion in 1979. China and the US will have their own wish list in up­com­ing ne­go­ti­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Trade is the low­est hang­ing fruit. China can im­port more US farm prod­ucts, but would want Mr Bi­den to scrap tar­iffs im­posed by Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>The US was con­spic­u­ously ab­sent when 15 Asia-Pa­cific coun­tries, in­clud­ing China, formed the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship – the world’s largest free trade bloc – at a vir­tual re­gional sum­mit in Hanoi on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>China has fur­ther opened its fi­nan­cial mar­ket, to the de­light of Wall Street, US banks and in­sur­ers.</p>
    <p>But Mr Bi­den will find it dif­fi­cult to undo Mr Trump’s tech war and lift a ban on sell­ing chips to tele­coms gi­ant Huawei, or give up seek­ing the ex­tra­di­tion of Meng Wanzhou, daugh­ter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, from Canada.</p>
    <p>It is a given that Mr Bi­den will press China on hu­man rights. But Xin­jiang and Hong Kong are sovereignt­y is­sues for Bei­jing and back­ing down is not an op­tion. China ar­gues that the tough mea­sures are needed to re­store sta­bil­ity in the two ter­ri­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Uighur Mus­lims were blamed for three ter­ror­ist at­tacks be­tween 2009 and 2014 that left about 230 peo­ple dead and more than 1,900 peo­ple wounded, mostly Han Chi­nese. Hong Kong was rocked by months of ri­ot­ing last year.</p>
    <p>Top­ping China’s wish list is likely to be the US stop­ping mil­i­tary in­cur­sions into China’s airspace and ter­ri­to­rial wa­ters near Tai­wan and in the dis­puted South China Sea.</p>
    <p>“When these hap­pened dur­ing the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, we could un­der­stand and have been re­strain­ing our­selves. But these provoca­tive ac­tions must stop af­ter Bi­den takes over,” a sec­ond source with ties to the Chi­nese lead­er­ship said, re­quest­ing anonymity.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan and the South China Sea are also sovereignt­y is­sues for Bei­jing, which refers to them as “core in­ter­ests”.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing Mr Trump’s four-year pres­i­dency, Amer­ica’s re­la­tions with Tai­wan be­came too close for China’s com­fort. He sent the health sec­re­tary and an un­der­sec­re­tary to the self-gov­erned demo­cratic is­land, which Bei­jing has claimed as its own since 1949.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den will con­tinue to sell weapons to Tai­wan even though it is an open se­cret that the is­land’s rul­ing party pre­ferred Mr Trump over Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>Some Chi­nese party in­sid­ers are op­ti­mistic China and the US can co­op­er­ate on cli­mate change and non-pro­lif­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>But Mr Bi­den will have a lot on his plate af­ter as­sum­ing the pres­i­dency in Jan­uary, grap­pling with the Covid-19 pan­demic, heal­ing the wounds of a po­lit­i­cally and racially di­vided Amer­ica, and wor­ry­ing about eco­nomic re­cov­ery. He could also face a Se­nate dom­i­nated by Repub­li­cans.</p>
    <p>Adding to his woes, Mr Trump, who gar­nered about 73.7 mil­lion votes, just six mil­lion shy of Mr Bi­den’s tally, ap­pears un­will­ing to con­cede de­feat and could give Mr Bi­den grief.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den could try to re­gain the moral high ground lost by Mr Trump and form an al­liance of democ­ra­cies – a move that would be seen by China as vin­di­ca­tion of its sus­pi­cions that the US is de­ter­mined to not just con­tain it, but also bring down the Com­mu­nist Party.</p>
    <p>On the se­cu­rity front, China sees the Quadri­lat­eral Se­cu­rity Di­a­logue – which con­sists of Aus­tralia, In­dia, Ja­pan and the US – as a Na­to­like mil­i­tary al­liance against it.</p>
    <p>A Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman be­lat­edly con­grat­u­lated Mr Bi­den on Nov 13, but Pres­i­dent Xi has yet to send a ca­ble to Mr Bi­den, os­ten­si­bly to give Pres­i­dent Trump face and pre­vent him from re­sort­ing to ex­treme mea­sures in the run-up to Jan 20, when the in­au­gu­ra­tion takes place.</p>
    <p>China also does not want to give the im­pres­sion it is des­per­ate and overea­ger to please Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>At the re­cent Bloomberg New Econ­omy Fo­rum, for­mer US sec­re­tary of state Henry Kissinger urged the in­com­ing Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion to move quickly to re­store lines of com­mu­ni­ca­tion with China.</p>
    <p>“Un­less there is some ba­sis for some co­op­er­a­tive ac­tion (be­tween China and the US), the world will slide into a catas­tro­phe com­pa­ra­ble to World War I.”</p>
    <p>At the same fo­rum, China’s No. 2 se­cu­ri­ties reg­u­la­tor Fang Xing­hai also urged the US to take a more pa­tient ap­proach, say­ing that the su­per­power was push­ing too fast for change from the world’s sec­ond­largest econ­omy.</p>
    <p>He hoped for bet­ter re­la­tions un­der Mr Bi­den and said China and the US need each other.</p>
    <p>The ball is now in Mr Bi­den’s court.</p>
