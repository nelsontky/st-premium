    <p>We are very grate­ful to SportSG for sup­port­ing us through this pe­riod but new growth ob­vi­ously needs ad­di­tional in­vest­ments, so the new com­mit­tee has been look­ing out for spon­sor­ships and com­mer­cial op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>After decades of lo­cal track and field un­der­per­form­ing on the re­gional and in­ter­na­tional stage, it is no sur­prise that newly elected Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics (SA) chief Lien Choong Luen and his team have been in a hurry.</p>
    <p>Less than six weeks after he and his full slate of nine were voted in as SA’s man­age­ment com­mit­tee (MC) on Sept 25, var­i­ous items on a full in-tray have been ad­dressed.</p>
    <p>On Oct 16, it mended fences with na­tional marathoner Soh Rui Yong, who had been em­broiled in le­gal is­sues with the gov­ern­ing body for close to a year.</p>
    <p>High per­for­mance is also on the agenda, with t he Hanoi SEA Games set to take place next Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>A vir­tual town hall is sched­uled for to­day, when SA will host a di­a­logue ses­sion with ath­letes hop­ing to earn a ticket to Viet­nam. Coaches and par­ents of ath­letes have also been in­vited.</p>
    <p>The new SA lead­er­ship has also up­dated the as­so­ci­a­tion’s mul­ti­year sports plan (MYSP) – which had been ap­proved for fund­ing up to 2024 by na­tional agency Sport Sin­ga­pore (SportSG) – with a re­vised bud­get al­lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Lien, who is Gojek Sin­ga­pore’s gen­eral man­ager, said: “High per­for­mance is the sole prov­ince of the as­so­ci­a­tion, and so while par­tic­i­pa­tion is also im­por­tant, in the im­me­di­ate term we have to get the per­for­mance part right.”</p>
    <p>He did not elab­o­rate on the spe­cific changes to the MYSP.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Sports In­sti­tute chief Toh Boon Yi also did not go into details but stressed that for the plan – which fea­tures long-term goals and key mile­stones jointly iden­ti­fied by SportSG and SA – to come to fruition, co­he­sion of the whole ecosys­tem is vi­tal.</p>
    <p>He added that SportSG is “com­mit­ted to sup­port such an ef­fort that comes with de­tailed plan­ning and on-ground ac­tions” to build an en­vi­ron­ment where ath­lete and coach path­ways sup­port their developmen­t and po­ten­tial.</p>
    <p>SA’s over­all fund­ing is another area Lien hopes to beef up. It re­ceived close to $1.52 mil­lion from SportSG for the 2018-2019 fi­nan­cial year.</p>
    <p>He said: “We are very grate­ful to SportSG for sup­port­ing us through this pe­riod but new growth ob­vi­ously needs ad­di­tional in­vest­ments, so the new com­mit­tee has been look­ing out for spon­sor­ships and com­mer­cial op­por­tu­ni­ties.”</p>
    <p>Spon­sor­ship and do­na­tions to­talled about $160,000 in the 2018-2019 pe­riod, and SA is also ex­plor­ing fund-rais­ing ac­tiv­i­ties like event or­gan­is­ing and have ap­proached at least 10 po­ten­tial part­ners.</p>
    <p>Another task to ad­dress is the hir­ing of an ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor fol­low­ing Ma­lik Alju­nied’s de­par­ture last month. The po­si­tion, which is a part of the MC but does not hold a vote in com­mit­tee mat­ters, is va­cant.</p>
    <p>Lien, 43, said he is look­ing for some­one who can man­age ex­ter­nal stake­hold­ers, lead the sec­re­tariat, man­age a bud­get and has ex­pe­ri­ence or­gan­is­ing events.</p>
    <p>He hailed his team for the time, com­mit­ment “and many sleep­less nights” they have put in since the election, hav­ing cam­paigned on a 100-day time­line to achieve some tan­gi­ble re­sults.</p>
    <p>He added: “We have 70 more days to go and hope­fully we’ll have some firm foot­ing by then.”</p>
