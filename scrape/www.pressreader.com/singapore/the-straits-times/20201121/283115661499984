    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Try to make a play – your goals are much closer to com­ple­tion. Things should keep mov­ing your way, but you have to con­trib­ute en­ergy to make it hap­pen.</p>
    <p>Tau­rus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>Peo­ple are pok­ing at you re­lent­lessly – re­sist the urge to poke back. That is ex­actly what they want and you do not have to play their game.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>You could be swayed by sur­pris­ing ar­gu­ments – so see if you can pay at­ten­tion when peo­ple are try­ing to per­suade you.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Some­one asks a sim­ple ques­tion – but it might make you lose your tem­per if you are not care­ful. Take a deep breath and use your head.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Try not to get in­volved in any con­flicts as you are sure to find that you are at least half wrong by the end of the day.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Your men­tal flex­i­bil­ity is the key to suc­cess – a crazy idea is ex­actly what is needed, so keep an open mind.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Cre­ative en­ergy is fill­ing you up and forc­ing you in bold new di­rec­tions. See if you can get your peo­ple to help out as you dream up wild things to try.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Some­one blows up, prob­a­bly at home. It could be you, an up­set child or maybe a guest who is het up over some­thing he heard on the news.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>You need to say hello to new peo­ple – some­one you met is sure to change your life, but that is true only if you get out there and mix it up.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>Your big ideas may not work out all that well, so do what you can to come up with a backup plan. You should be able to min­imise the stress.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>A mount­ing sense of ex­cite­ment keeps you go­ing – so much so that you may in­spire oth­ers to freak out and join your pa­rade.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>A dream points you to­wards some­thing new and ex­cit­ing. It could be cryp­tic, but more likely, it is pretty straight­for­ward. You may need to make big changes.</p>
