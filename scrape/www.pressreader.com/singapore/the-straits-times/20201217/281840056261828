    <p>•</p>
    <p>Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son will travel to In­dia next month in his first ma­jor bi­lat­eral visit to an­other coun­try since tak­ing power last year, his of­fice has said, as the gov­ern­ment eyes post-Brexit trade deals.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the trip, Mr John­son will in­vite In­dia to j oin next year’s Group of Seven sum­mit, which Bri­tain is host­ing, as one of three guest coun­tries, along­side South Korea and Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>The In­dian trip is aimed at strength­en­ing bi­lat­eral trade ties and in­vest­ment, and co­op­er­a­tion in var­i­ous ar­eas in­clud­ing de­fence, se­cu­rity, health and cli­mate change, his of­fice said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>It will co­in­cide with In­dia’s Repub­lic Day cel­e­bra­tions on Jan 26, and come just weeks af­ter Bri­tain leaves the Euro­pean Union sin­gle mar­ket on Dec 31, and as it seeks new trade deals post-Brexit.</p>
    <p>“I am ab­so­lutely de­lighted to be vis­it­ing In­dia next year at the start of an ex­cit­ing year for Global Bri­tain, and look for­ward to de­liv­er­ing the quan­tum leap in our bi­lat­eral re­la­tion­ship that Prime Min­is­ter (Naren­dra) Modi and I have pledged to achieve,” Mr John­son said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“As a key player in the Indo-Pa­cific re­gion, In­dia is an in­creas­ingly in­dis­pens­able part­ner for the UK as we work to boost jobs and growth (and) con­front shared threats to our se­cu­rity.”</p>
    <p>Mr John­son’s planned trip fol­lows an in­vi­ta­tion from Mr Modi, who last week­end took part in a cli­mate sum­mit hosted by Lon­don, and its an­nounce­ment comes as Bri­tish For­eign Sec­re­tary Do­minic Raab vis­ited In­dia on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“What we recog­nise (are) the pos­si­bil­i­ties for a deeper trad­ing re­la­tion­ship, the con­tours of our econ</p>
    <p>omy I think would al­low that,” Mr Raab told a New Delhi news con­fer­ence with his In­dian coun­ter­part S. Jais­hankar. “We will want to nudge our trade min­is­ters along and see</p>
    <p>what we can achieve.”</p>
    <p>Mr Jais­hankar said there was “a very se­ri­ous in­tent” to in­ten­sify the two coun­tries’ trade re­la­tion­ship. “We see the strate­gic case,” he told re­porters.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain left the EU on Jan 31 and is in a stand­still tran­si­tion pe­riod where the bloc’s rules still ap­ply un­til Dec 31, as it tries to se­cure a free­trade agree­ment.</p>
    <p>But it has in re­cent months struck deals with a num­ber of coun­tries, in­clud­ing Ja­pan and Sin­ga­pore, as part of its post-Brexit “Global Bri­tain” strat­egy.</p>
    <p>As part of the plan, Bri­tain an­nounced on Tues­day that it had signed a trade deal with Mex­ico, with plans for a more sub­stan­tial agree­ment next year.</p>
    <p>“This deal sup­ports a trad­ing re­la­tion­ship worth more than £5 bil­lion (S$9 bil­lion) and locks in ac­cess to each other’s mar­kets,” said Bri­tish Trade Sec­re­tary Liz Truss.</p>
    <p>“This is also the sev­enth trade deal we’ve se­cured with a mem­ber of CPTPP (Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Tran­sPa­cific Part­ner­ship), the group­ing of 11 dy­namic economies around the Pa­cific. So, it’s an­other re­ally im­por­tant step­ping stone to­wards the UK join­ing CPTPP,” she added.</p>
    <p>In In­dia, Mr Raab said Bri­tain had been “too my­opi­cally fo­cused just on Europe” in the past, but could now look fur­ther afield.</p>
    <p>“And cer­tainly if you look at In­dia and the Indo-Pa­cific re­gion and take a long-term view, that is where the growth op­por­tu­ni­ties will be,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son will be only the sec­ond Bri­tish leader since In­dia’s in­de­pen­dence from Bri­tain to at­tend the an­nual Repub­lic Day pa­rade in New Delhi as guest of honour, af­ter Mr John Ma­jor in 1993.</p>
    <p>His of­fice high­lighted the two coun­tries’ bur­geon­ing trade and in­vest­ment link, which it said is worth £24 bil­lion an­nu­ally and sup­ports more than half a mil­lion jobs.</p>
    <p>It noted their in­creased co­op­er­a­tion dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, with In­dia’s large phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal sec­tor sup­ply­ing more than half of the world’s vac­cines. At least a bil­lion doses of Bri­tain’s Ox­ford-As­traZeneca vac­cine are be­ing man­u­fac­tured at the Serum In­sti­tute in the In­dian city of Pune.</p>
