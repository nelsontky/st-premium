    <p>De­spite strict lock­downs, In­dia has emerged as a global coro­n­avirus hot spot that could out­strip the US at the rate daily cases are ris­ing.</p>
    <p>The last 24 hours up to Saturday saw 85,362 new in­fec­tions in In­dia, tak­ing the to­tal past 5.9 mil­lion cases.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Harsh Vard­han has blamed “ir­re­spon­si­ble be­hav­iour” amid slowly eased re­stric­tions for the daily surge in cases, while ex­perts be­lieve it is also a fail­ure in com­mu­ni­cat­ing the im­por­tance of main­tain­ing prac­tices like so­cial dis­tanc­ing, par­tic­u­larly dif­fi­cult in densely pop­u­lated cities.</p>
    <p>Singer S.P. Bala­sub­rah­manyam, who was hos­pi­talised af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus last month, died on Friday, aged 74. To date, some 92,290 peo­ple have died of Covid-19-re­lated causes in In­dia.</p>
    <p>Still, in the 24 hours up to Saturday, 93,420 peo­ple re­cov­ered from the virus. “Peo­ple are re­cov­er­ing, they need not panic,” said Dr Ra­jni Kant from the In­dian Coun­cil of Med­i­cal Re­search, adding that the high re­cov­ery rate had been a con­sis­tent trend in In­dia.</p>
    <p>The death rate has been lower than in other na­tions, at 67 deaths per mil­lion pop­u­la­tion com­pared with the US’ 626 deaths per mil­lion pop­u­la­tion. But un­cer­tainty re­mains over the tra­jec­tory of the virus in the world’s sec­ond-most pop­u­lous coun­try of 1.35 bil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“There is a de­cline in some states but it’s too early to pre­dict,” said Dr Kant, warn­ing that there was no room for com­pla­cency.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties are brac­ing them­selves for the fes­tive sea­son, which starts next month and typ­i­cally sees big crowds gath­er­ing for cel­e­bra­tions, in­clud­ing Deep­avali.</p>
    <p>“We have to re­mem­ber that this pan­demic has to be con­trolled and deaths due to Covid kept at a min­i­mum... Crowd­ing dur­ing the festival sea­son can lead to an ex­plo­sive sit­u­a­tion,” think-tank NITI Aayog mem­ber (health) V.K. Paul warned at a re­cent brief­ing.</p>
    <p>In­dia has been slowly eas­ing re­stric­tions since March, al­low­ing flights, train ser­vices and the met­ros. Fed­eral au­thor­i­ties are mov­ing to re­open schools for se­nior classes in spite of re­sis­tance from par­ents and some state au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has been un­der pres­sure to ease re­stric­tions given the de­te­ri­o­rat­ing health of the econ­omy, which con­tracted by 23.9 per cent in the April to June pe­riod.</p>
    <p>But the re­lax­ations, along with the fact that peo­ple are tired of the pan­demic, could lead to a rise in cases.</p>
    <p>“There is fa­tigue set in and the pre­ven­tive mea­sures re­quired to dis­rupt trans­mis­sion are not be­ing taken up with promp­ti­tude. Peo­ple are barely com­ply­ing with the masks, dis­tanc­ing or non-crowd­ing,” said Ms K. Su­jatha Rao, a for­mer sec­re­tary of health and fam­ily wel­fare. “The gov­ern­ment should have in­vested much more on cam­paigns to ed­u­cate peo­ple to bring in the de­sired be­hav­iour change.”</p>
    <p>Ms Rao said that test­ing in some states was in­ad­e­quate, with no uni­form guide­lines to mea­sure work done. She said In­dia, like the United States, did not have a well-co­or­di­nated na­tional re­sponse.</p>
    <p>Re­cent sero-preva­lence stud­ies, which test for an­ti­bod­ies in the pop­u­la­tion in­di­cat­ing pre­vi­ous in­fec­tions, have shown that the virus was much more wide­spread than orig­i­nally es­ti­mated or re­ported.</p>
    <p>In­dia, how­ever, has been able to build up its ca­pa­bil­i­ties dur­ing the lock­down, from ramp­ing up test­ing, which touched 1.5 mil­lion sam­ples, to in­creas­ing pro­duc­tion of masks and pro­tec­tive equip­ment, and adding Covid-19 fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The con­tin­u­ing con­cern is over how the virus spreads in ru­ral ar­eas where health in­fra­struc­ture is weak­est.</p>
    <p>An ar­ti­cle in the jour­nal Lancet noted how the pan­demic had led to in­no­va­tion, with In­dia be­ing the first to use pooled test­ing of mul­ti­ple swab sam­ples at one go to save lab re­sources, and be­ing at the fore­front of vac­cine de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>But the ar­ti­cle warned: “The epidemic in In­dia is far from over, with a po­ten­tially huge bur­den of mor­tal­ity and mor­bid­ity to come un­less pub­lic health mea­sures are used and ad­hered to. With­out clear and hon­est com­mu­ni­ca­tion of the risks of Covid-19 to the pop­u­la­tion, stem­ming the epidemic will be im­pos­si­ble.”</p>
