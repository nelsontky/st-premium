    <p>MANILA • Thou­sands of devo­tees packed a church in the Philip­pine cap­i­tal yes­ter­day for a glimpse of a cen­turies-old statue of Je­sus Christ be­lieved to have mirac­u­lous heal­ing pow­ers, af­ter an an­nual pa­rade was can­celled be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ig­nor­ing of­fi­cial pleas to stay home be­cause of the virus threat, Catholics wear­ing masks and face shields gath­ered along an av­enue out­side the Quiapo Church in Manila where the first of 15 masses for the feast of the Black Nazarene be­gan be­fore dawn.</p>
    <p>People pa­tiently waited to en­ter the church or watched the backto-back masses broad­cast live on large screens out­side.</p>
    <p>The or­derly scenes were in con­trast to the nor­mal fren­zied pro­ces­sion in­volv­ing hun­dreds of thou­sands of pil­grims risk­ing life and limb to touch the icon in the be­lief that it can heal the sick.</p>
    <p>The life-size statue – brought to the Philip­pines in the early 1600s when the coun­try was a Span­ish colony – is tra­di­tion­ally pulled through the packed streets of the cap­i­tal on a float in one of the world’s big­gest dis­plays of Catholic de­vo­tion.</p>
    <p>But fear­ing it could turn into a virus su­per-spreader event this year, the au­thor­i­ties can­celled the pa­rade for the first time in decades and in­stead urged people to watch the masses live-streamed on Face­book.</p>
    <p>Wor­ship­pers at the church were forced to look but not touch the icon, which was placed out of reach on a bal­cony above the en­trance. For many, that was enough.</p>
    <p>“I’m so happy with what I’m see­ing here now,” said Mr Ge­orge Arevalo, 32, af­ter at­tend­ing mass where social distancing rules limited the con­gre­ga­tion to about 400 people for each ser­vice.</p>
    <p>He added that he touched the statue for the first time dur­ing the 2017 pro­ces­sion, an act he be­lieves en­sured his wife, who has epilepsy and was preg­nant at the time, was able to de­liver a healthy baby.</p>
    <p>The risk of catch­ing the coron­avirus, which has in­fected nearly half a mil­lion people in the coun­try, did not bother Ms Mar­lene Or­diales, 58, who be­lieved the Black Nazarene would pro­tect her.</p>
    <p>“I don’t mind the pan­demic. I leave it up to him,” she said as she waited to en­ter the church.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral thou­sand po­lice of­fi­cers were de­ployed to en­sure social distancing in the de­vout crowd, which Manila’s dis­as­ter agency es­ti­mated had to­talled more than 30,000 in the first few hours of the cel­e­bra­tion.</p>
    <p>About 80 per cent of Filipinos con­sider them­selves to be Catholic. The statue is called the Black Nazarene be­cause of its charred colour, be­lieved to have oc­curred when it sur­vived a fire aboard a ship en route from Mex­ico.</p>
