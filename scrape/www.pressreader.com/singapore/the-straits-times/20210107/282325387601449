    <p>MEM­PHIS • With the ex­cep­tion of Den­nis Schroder, the rest of the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers’ sum­mer ac­qui­si­tions have yet to re­ally make their mark on the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) cham­pi­ons.</p>
    <p>But when you have Fi­nals Most Valu­able Player LeBron James and fel­low All-Star An­thony Davis on the court, their pres­ence can pretty much com­pen­sate for any off night the team might have.</p>
    <p>The duo picked up the pace when the Lak­ers needed them most, com­ing up big in the wan­ing min­utes to eke out a 94-92 NBA vic­tory over the Mem­phis Griz­zlies on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>They scored a game-high 26 points apiece to make it four suc­ces­sive wins on the road, im­prov­ing their record to 6-2 over­all and mov­ing to the top of the Western Con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Los An­ge­les came out on the right side of the ledger on a night when their other team­mates strug­gled with their shoot­ing.</p>
    <p>Schroder was the only other player to get into dou­ble fig­ures with 12 points, so Davis and James had to step up, with the four-time NBA cham­pion, who added 11 re­bounds and seven as­sists, scor­ing 21 of his points in the sec­ond half.</p>
    <p>The for­wards com­bined for 15 straight Lak­ers points in the fourth quar­ter, l ead­ing to praise from coach Frank Vo­gel.</p>
    <p>“That’s why he’s great,” he said of James tak­ing the game by the scruff of the neck along­side Davis.</p>
    <p>“He finds a way to make those su­per­hero-type of plays. Our fo­cus is on mak­ing sure we don’t need those su­per­hero-type of plays to close games out.</p>
    <p>“I have a lot of con­fi­dence in LeBron James in the fourth quar­ter. I don’t re­ally know any other way to say that. I trust him.</p>
    <p>“He’s ob­vi­ously one of the most im­pres­sive peo­ple I’ve ever been around.”</p>
    <p>James, how­ever, played down the plau­dits, in­sist­ing it was all about keep­ing the Lak­ers “in the win­ning busi­ness”.</p>
    <p>“We were able to close the game out, get some timely stops and some timely buck­ets,” he added.</p>
    <p>The Lak­ers now have a twogame home­s­tand, start­ing with the San An­to­nio Spurs at the Sta­ples Cen­tre to­day, and Vo­gel is look­ing for­ward to some rest and recre­ation, hav­ing been on the road for the past week and sub­ject to strict coro­n­avirus pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>“It’s al­most like we were in the (Dis­ney World) bub­ble, ex­cept we’re not in the bub­ble,” he said. “You kind of go to work, go back to the ho­tel and not too much else.”</p>
    <p>Over in the Eastern Con­fer­ence, Kyrie Irv­ing car­ried the load for the Brook­lyn Nets in the ab­sence of fel­low All-Star Kevin Du­rant, scor­ing a team-high 29 points in a 130-96 romp over the Utah Jazz.</p>
    <p>It was just what his team, who im­proved to 4-4, needed fol­low­ing Spencer Din­wid­die’s knee lig­a­ment in­jury and see­ing Du­rant ruled out for seven days due to safety pro­to­cols af­ter con­tact with some­one who tested pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Caris LeVert, who con­trib­uted 24 points off the bench, claimed that Irv­ing’s dis­play came as no sur­prise to his Nets team­mates.</p>
    <p>“We kind of ex­pect that from him,” the for­ward added. “That was a great start. He took the shots the de­fence gave him, and he was very ef­fi­cient out there, great at lead­ing as well... it looked very seam­less out there. I think Ky should get a lot of credit for that.”</p>

    <p>FRANK VO­GEL, LA Lak­ers coach, laud­ing LeBron James’ con­tri­bu­tion while lament­ing that the team did not close out the game ear­lier.</p>
