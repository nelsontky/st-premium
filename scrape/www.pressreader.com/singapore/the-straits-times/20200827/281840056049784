    <p>MEX­ICO CITY • Young peo­ple are driv­ing the spread of the novel coro­n­avirus in the Amer­i­cas, the head of the Pan Amer­i­can Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (Paho) said yes­ter­day, not­ing that both deaths and caseloads have dou­bled in the re­gion over the past six weeks.</p>
    <p>Brief­ing re­porters on a we­b­cast, Dr Carissa Eti­enne chas­tised gov­ern­ments that have rushed eco­nomic re­open­ings de­spite data that shows a wors­en­ing pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“This is not a good sign. Wish­ing the virus away will not work,” she said, de­tail­ing what she de­scribed as a “real dis­con­nect” be­tween the re­lax­ation of con­tain­ment mea­sures and t he con­tin­u­ing spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>The Paho is the Wash­ing­ton­based Amer­i­cas arm of the UN World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Since last month, coro­n­avirus cases in the Amer­i­cas have more than dou­bled to about 12 mil­lion con­firmed in­fec­tions, while deaths have shot up by roughly the same rate to some 450,000, ac­cord­ing to Paho data.</p>
    <p>Dr Eti­enne said that “the vast ma­jor­ity” of re­ported Covid-19 cases in the Amer­i­cas have been among those be­tween the ages of 19 and 59, but that al­most 70 per cent of deaths have been among in­di­vid­u­als who are 60 years old or older.</p>
    <p>“This in­di­cates that younger peo­ple are pri­mar­ily driv­ing the spread of the dis­ease in our re­gion,” she said.</p>
    <p>A re­cent uptick in cases in sev­eral Caribbean na­tions in­clud­ing the Ba­hamas is also a grow­ing con­cern, said Dr Eti­enne, with new in­fec­tions driven by not only tourism but also re­turn­ing res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Over­all, gov­ern­ments should base their re­open­ing de­ci­sions on the best avail­able data, and ex­pand test­ing and con­tract trac­ing pro­grammes to bet­ter iden­tify and con­trol spikes in cases, she said.</p>
    <p>Six of the world’s 10 most af­fected coun­tries are in the Amer­i­cas, said Dr Eti­enne, point­ing to the United States, Brazil, Mex­ico, Colom­bia, Peru and Ar­gentina.</p>
