    <p>NO KILLER IN­STINCT</p>
    <p>The game was re­ally poor. Look­ing at the teams, they have to show the de­sire to win the game. I’ve never seen so many hugs and chats af­ter the game... I don’t get it. Ev­ery­one wants to be pals.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>Manch­ester United man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer in­sisted his side pro­duced their best per­for­mance of his time in charge against Manch­ester City even though an unin­spir­ing 0-0 draw at Old Traf­ford did lit­tle for their chances of win­ning the Pre­mier League.</p>
    <p>Af­ter crash­ing out of the Cham­pi­ons League at the group stage in mid­week, Satur­day’s draw at least saved the Nor­we­gian from an­other de­feat that would have brought more scru­tiny of his po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>A share of the spoils also kept eighth-placed United one point and one spot bet­ter off than their lo­cal ri­vals (19) be­fore yes­ter­day’s matches. But there was lit­tle to sug­gest ei­ther side will fight their way into the ti­tle race.</p>
    <p>Other than the video as­sis­tant ref­eree chalk­ing off a penalty that was awarded for a sec­ond-half foul by Kyle Walker on Mar­cus Rash­ford, who was deemed to be off­side, it was a game that saw pre­cious lit­tle ac­tion at both ends.</p>
    <p>United beat City three times last sea­son, in­clud­ing a league dou­ble, but Sol­sk­jaer pointed to the smash and grab na­ture of those vic­to­ries as Pep Guardi­ola’s men were eas­ily un­done on the counter-at­tack.</p>
    <p>With both sides seem­ingly more in­tent on not los­ing than win­ning – there were just two shots on tar­get by ei­ther team – pun­dits unan­i­mously felt it was a drab af­fair, but Sol­sk­jaer dis­agreed.</p>
    <p>“In my time against City, that’s the best per­for­mance we’ve had. Not the best re­sult, but the best per­for­mance,” he said. “We beat them last sea­son but those were dif­fer­ent games, we counter-at­tacked.</p>
    <p>“To­day was the most we’ve been in the game, we kept them away from our box more. With the ball, we didn’t cre­ate as much as we wanted to.</p>
    <p>“They prob­a­bly had the big­ger mo­ments in open play, we had a few mo­ments in cor­ners. Over­all, a draw, ev­ery­one should be happy with that.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Red Devils have now won just one of their open­ing six home league games and look set for an­other cam­paign where a top-four fin­ish rather than a ti­tle tilt will be the tar­get.</p>
    <p>They have also failed to score in three home league games this sea­son, one more than in the whole of the 2019-20 cam­paign, lead­ing for­mer United cap­tain Roy Keane to</p>
    <p>ROY KEANE, for­mer Manch­ester United cap­tain, ques­tion­ing whether United or City wanted to win.</p>
    <p>hit out at the lack of pas­sion on the pitch.</p>
    <p>“The game was re­ally poor. Look­ing at the teams, they have to show the de­sire to win the game,” the pun­dit told Sky Sports.</p>
    <p>“We got two book­ings in a derby. I’ve never seen so many hugs and chats af­ter the game. I’m scratch­ing my head. I’m re­ally frus­trated.</p>
    <p>“At the end, the staff are smil­ing and hug­ging, the play­ers are chat­ting. Just get down the tun­nel. I don’t get it. Ev­ery­one wants to be pals.”</p>
    <p>Gary Neville, his for­mer United team­mate, agreed, adding: “There was no in­tent, whether on the pitch or from the man­agers to win the match.</p>
    <p>“That was re­ally poor, and we shouldn’t ac­cept that.”</p>
    <p>De­spite the bore draw, City went home hap­pier as Guardi­ola felt it was a point gained, rather than two points dropped.</p>
    <p>While they matched a club record af­ter a sixth con­sec­u­tive clean sheet, the vis­i­tors have now failed to score in two straight away league games for the first time since Jan­uary 2017.</p>
    <p>But Guardi­ola ad­mit­ted he had de­lib­er­ately played it conservati­ve af­ter be­ing stung last term.</p>
    <p>“Take a look last sea­son how they beat us,” the Spa­niard said. “The qual­ity of this team is they can play when you let them run.</p>
    <p>“The im­por­tant thing is we were so solid, we didn’t con­cede and on av­er­age had more chances. The game was tight, re­spect from both sides, and a good point for us.”</p>
