    <p>The bats that have been fly­ing into some res­i­dents’ homes in Block 14 Up­per Boon Keng Road do not pos­sess vir­u­lent strains of the coro­n­avirus, Min­is­ter for Man­power and Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Home Af­fairs Josephine Teo said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo, who is MP for Jalan Be­sar GRC where the block is lo­cated, said some res­i­dents had alerted her to the bats, which live in nearby fruit trees.</p>
    <p>Since the start of the Covid-19 out­break, peo­ple have grown con­cerned about the pres­ence of bats, a source of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>A World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion sci­en­tist had said in May that SarsCoV-2, which causes Covid-19, comes from a group of viruses that orig­i­nate or spread in bats.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary, The Straits Times re­ported that the Singapore au­thor­i­ties were re­ceiv­ing more bat-re­lated re­ports than usual, with some peo­ple wor­ried they may catch the coro­n­avirus from the crea­tures.</p>
    <p>One per­son re­port­edly threw a live bat down a rub­bish chute at that time.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar con­cerns have emerged among the Boon Keng res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing this in a Face­book post, Mrs Teo said: “Our res­i­dents were con­cerned about the pos­si­bil­ity of bats be­ing dis­ease car­ri­ers and not know­ing the proper way to ‘usher’ these ‘guests’ out of their homes.”</p>
    <p>She added that her team had con­tacted the Na­tional Parks Board (NParks), which sent an of­fi­cer and a bat re­search spe­cial­ist to visit the af­fected res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>They as­sured the res­i­dents that the bats do not pos­sess vir­u­lent strains of the coro­n­avirus, and also ex­plained the im­por­tant eco­log­i­cal roles of bats as pol­li­na­tors and in con­trol­ling in­sect pop­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said the of­fi­cers also taught res­i­dents how to de­ter bats from fly­ing into their units by us­ing meth­ods such as hang­ing shiny ob­jects like CDs at en­trance points, and in­stalling a mag­netic fly mesh or in­sect net­ting at the win­dows.</p>
    <p>The town coun­cil had also pruned the nearby fruit trees to en­cour­age the bats to cre­ate their homes away from res­i­den­tial units.</p>
    <p>“I hope that our res­i­dents are more as­sured, and have bet­ter ideas how to pre­vent fu­ture oc­cur­rence(s) of such un­wel­comed vis­its,” Mrs Teo wrote.</p>
    <p>She ad­vised those who en­counter sim­i­lar is­sues to call the NParks An­i­mal Man­age­ment Cen­tre on 1800-476-1600 for im­me­di­ate as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>ST has con­tacted NParks for fur­ther in­for­ma­tion on the bats.</p>
