    <p>The move to re­lax re­stric­tions and en­ter phase three of the econ­omy’s re­open­ing on Dec 28 was wel­comed by busi­nesses, with those in the re­tail, restau­rant and tourism sec­tors hope­ful of a boost in sales or foot­fall by 10 per cent to 20 per cent.</p>
    <p>But a real game changer for the econ­omy could be when enough peo­ple take up the Covid-19 vac­cine, so more re­stric­tions can be re­laxed, in­clud­ing bor­der con­trols, busi­nesses and an­a­lysts told The Straits Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Dr Kevin Cheong, chair­man of the As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore At­trac­tions, said the move to al­low ap­proved tourist at­trac­tions to in­crease their op­er­at­ing ca­pac­ity from the cur­rent 50 per cent to up to 65 per cent is sig­nif­i­cant.</p>
    <p>“This will al­low at­trac­tions to be able to ac­com­mo­date more vis­i­tors dur­ing week­ends and pub­lic hol­i­days – we can make hay while the sun shines,” he said, adding that foot­fall to tourist at­trac­tions is ex­pected to grow by 15 per cent to 20 per cent across the board with this change.</p>
    <p>Al­low­ing peo­ple to gather in</p>
    <p>groups of eight – up from five – is also a wel­come move, said Mr An­drew Tjioe, pres­i­dent and chief ex­ec­u­tive of TungLok Group.</p>
    <p>“(The) ma­jor­ity of TungLok’s restau­rants are Chi­nese restau­rants, and din­ers usu­ally come in big­ger fam­ily groups... It is also timely as we pre­pare for Chi­nese New Year re­unions,” he said.</p>
    <p>The re­tail sec­tor will also ben­e­fit from larger group sizes, though re</p>
    <p>tail­ers would have liked to see the changes kick in be­fore the fes­tive sea­son to take ad­van­tage of the hol­i­day sales boost, said Sin­ga­pore Re­tail­ers As­so­ci­a­tion ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Rose Tong. “But we ap­pre­ci­ate that the de­ci­sion was made with safety in mind,” she added.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it will be some time be­fore things re­turn to nor­mal, said Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion CEO Ho Meng Kit. Much hinges on</p>
    <p>the roll-out and take-up rate of a vac­cine, which will even­tu­ally pave the way for bor­ders to be re­opened once con­fi­dence in gov­ern­ments’ abil­ity to man­age the virus re­turns, he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Cheong and Ms Tong agreed, say­ing the re­turn of tourism will help bring foot­fall and sales fig­ures back to pre-Covid-19 lev­els.</p>
    <p>May­bank Kim Eng an­a­lyst Chua Hak Bin said sec­tors such as man­u­fac­tur­ing and con­struc­tion are also af­fected by labour short­age and sup­ply crunch is­sues as bor­ders are still largely closed, and this con­tin­ues to af­fect growth.</p>
    <p>Ms Cinn Tan, chief sales and mar­ket­ing of­fi­cer of Pan Pa­cific Ho­tels Group, said as de­mand in­creases with the relaxation of rules, hav­ing enough trained man­power will be a chal­lenge. More staff and re­sources will be needed so that restau­rants can serve food safely, and for thor­ough clean­ing and dis­in­fect­ing to be car­ried out, she added.</p>
    <p>A fur­ther eas­ing of re­stric­tions on re­turn­ing to the work­place would be ben­e­fi­cial for Sal­adS­top, which serves a large base of cus­tomers in the Cen­tral Busi­ness District, said its manag­ing di­rec­tor Adrien Des­bail­lets.</p>
    <p>Mr Vin­cent Tan, manag­ing di­rec­tor of food ser­vice provider Se­lect Group, hopes food ca­ter­ing ser­vices would be able to grad­u­ally re­sume, with pilot schemes be­ing car­ried out to de­ter­mine what safe man­age­ment mea­sures would be needed.</p>
    <p>While the ca­pac­ity limit for malls and large stand­alone stores will be in­creased from 10 sq m per per­son to 8 sq m, Ms Tong noted that many re­tail­ers are still con­strained by the lay­out of their shop spa­ces.</p>
    <p>“Chang­ing the lay­out is eas­ier said than done, as there are ad­di­tional costs in­volved,” she said.</p>
    <p>Re­lax­ing rules on road shows and pro­mo­tional shows could make a dif­fer­ence to re­tail­ers, she added.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­a­tion of Small and Medium En­ter­prises vice-pres­i­dent Ang Yuit said that while the changes an­nounced have been in­cre­men­tal, they still make a dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“It means that we are mov­ing for­ward and Sin­ga­pore, as a na­tion, has been suc­cess­ful in con­tain­ing and manag­ing the virus,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It gives us room and rea­son to be op­ti­mistic about the fu­ture.”</p>
