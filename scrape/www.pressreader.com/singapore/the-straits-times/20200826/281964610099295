    <p>In the months lead­ing to the cir­cuit breaker (CB), I found my­self con­tem­plat­ing the question of busi­ness sur­vival.</p>
    <p>As our restau­rants geared up for Chi­nese New Year book­ings only to face pan­icked can­cel­la­tions and in­def­i­nite post­pone­ments, what loomed ahead was un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>In the early days of the pan­demic, sur­vival was a nag­ging con­cern. Could we make up the rev­enue lost from big events? That background whine grew into a louder worry as im­ported Covid-19 cases grew.</p>
    <p>With ro­ta­tional teams and work-from-home poli­cies, peo­ple traf­fic de­creased dra­mat­i­cally in the CBD (the Cen­tral Busi­ness District, where our restau­rants are lo­cated). Would we be able to at­tract even half of our usual crowd when the odds were stacked against us?</p>
    <p>Then, that al­ready mad­den­ing hum be­came deaf­en­ing when things came to an abrupt stand­still.</p>
    <p>Very quickly, en­ter­tain­ment out­lets were forced to close and restau­rants were ex­pected to pivot to take­out and de­liv­ery. Din­ing in was no longer an op­tion, not even with the so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules put in place a week ear­lier.</p>
    <p>I re­mem­ber watch­ing the Prime Min­is­ter’s speech live on YouTube with my seven-year- old daugh­ter. As she star­tled de­light­fully over the prospect of home­school­ing for a month, I knew that the question of sur­vival for restau­rants had dras­ti­cally changed in na­ture.</p>
    <p>The question was no longer about how to in­crease rev­enue to sus­tain the busi­ness, be­cause there was no more rev­enue to speak of.</p>
    <p>No mat­ter how hard we worked, take­out and de­liv­ery would make up no more than 5 per cent of nor­mal sales. The ex­is­ten­tial question con­fronting restau­rants was now an im­mi­nent one.</p>
    <p>Should we stay on to fight this war? The crush­ing im­pact of the CB had ex­posed the vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties of the food and bev­er­age (F&B) in­dus­try. Ra­zor-thin mar­gins from hav­ing to cope with ex­or­bi­tant rents and cus­tomer price sen­si­tiv­i­ties en­dowed by the in­for­ma­tion age meant that most restau­rants have no cap­i­tal re­serves.</p>
    <p>When I started out 15 years ago, sell­ing an ex­pe­ri­ence was the heart of F&B. When did that trans­form into sell­ing a so­cial me­dia pres­ence?</p>
    <p>I di­gress, but the point is that com­pe­ti­tion among F&B out­lets on so­cial me­dia gives the false im­pres­sion the in­dus­try is thriv­ing de­spite high rentals, price wars and man­power dif­fi­cul­ties. It is not.</p>
    <p>Now, the Covid-19 cri­sis has plunged us into a deep dive that will drown most of us, while food de­liv­ery plat­forms pig­gy­back on our plight to profit from high de­liv­ery com­mis­sions.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, land­lords de­lude them­selves into be­liev­ing that there will al­ways be an­other F&B ten­ant if we can­not pull through.</p>
    <p>For some, the dev­as­ta­tion of the F&B scene has not sunk in. I as­sure you that the scene has al­ready col­lapsed.</p>
    <p>Yet there is sol­i­dar­ity in the na­tion’s re­sponse to this col­lapse. An in­for­mal coali­tion we call “Savefnbsg” has a mem­ber­ship of around 250 restau­ra­teurs rep­re­sent­ing more than 500 out­lets; we chat ev­ery day on What­sApp and share tips, news and woes.</p>
    <p>We lobby, pe­ti­tion and stand to­gether, putting aside com­pe­ti­tion to fight for what our in­dus­try stands for. There are also other plat­forms, like Sin­ga­pore Restau­rant Res­cue, which has gar­nered 56,000 posts so far, and SG Restau­rant Sup­port.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers, both reg­u­lar and new, have shown us ex­tra­or­di­nary love by or­der­ing de­liv­er­ies and pur­chas­ing vouch­ers, send­ing words of en­cour­age­ment to our em­ploy­ees on the front line.</p>
    <p>Most im­por­tantly, the Gov­ern­ment has been stead­fast, try­ing its best to bal­ance the in­ter­ests of public health against the econ­omy; of cor­po­ra­tions against in­di­vid­ual em­ploy­ees; of per­sonal free­doms against com­mu­nity in­ter­ests. With the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act and Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS), the Gov­ern­ment has given us some­thing to stand be­hind.</p>
    <p>We stand be­hind more than the poli­cies them­selves, which re­quire a del­i­cate bal­anc­ing act that will not and can­not ben­e­fit all of us.</p>
    <p>Yes, there will al­ways be haters, peo­ple who cry in­jus­tice – “not fair!” – and peo­ple who think they would have done dif­fer­ently had they been in the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>There are also those, like me, who lament the short­fall in cer­tain poli­cies while cel­e­brat­ing their over­all co­gency. We call for bolder steps, like cap­ping the commission per­cent­age that food de­liv­ery plat­forms are al­lowed to de­mand to 15 per cent (like San Fran­cisco has done) in­stead of the cur­rent 30 per cent, and man­dat­ing that land­lords charge rental based on an agreed per­cent­age of gross turnover for the CB pe­riod.</p>
    <p>We call for more em­pa­thy, like un­der­stand­ing that JSS re­bates are but a frac­tion of what we need to sur­vive. We call for more trust, like do­ing away with per­sonal guar­an­tees on small loans to cred­i­ble restau­rants with a good track record.</p>
    <p>But what can­not be de­nied is that our Gov­ern­ment has demon­strated un­wa­ver­ing com­po­sure in these un­prece­dented times. Years of prepa­ra­tion for pan­demic readi­ness have paid off, en­abling our lead­er­ship to steer us out of these woods.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 cri­sis turns the spot­light on the mer­its of ev­ery gov­ern­ment’s so­cial con­tract with its peo­ple. Whereas Sin­ga­pore has of­ten been crit­i­cised for its un­will­ing­ness to ex­pand cer­tain free­doms, it is ob­vi­ous that what mat­ters most, in times of un­ex­pected and con­stant change, is that ev­ery­thing works.</p>
    <p>From de­ci­sive law-mak­ing to ex­pe­dited gov­ern­ment pay­outs; from au­to­mated ap­pli­ca­tion forms to cus­tomised ad­vice; from cen­tralised home-based learn­ing to child­care for those in es­sen­tial ser­vices, Sin­ga­pore has man­aged to tran­si­tion into the CB as though it has had sev­eral dress re­hearsals for this sce­nario.</p>
    <p>It is a re­lief that our Gov­ern­ment has been built on a model of so­cial con­tract that can as­sure us pro­tec­tion against a de­scent into chaos.</p>
    <p>It is that which we stand be­hind. I con­tinue to keep my restau­rant open for take­out and de­liv­ery al­though I see the rub­ble around me: em­ploy­ees I have had to lay off, salaries I have had to sus­pend or slash, sup­pli­ers I try to pay but can­not, and the mount­ing rent that my land­lord has stub­bornly re­fused to waive. I keep it open to sus­tain liveli­hoods as best I can, and to keep a small light on for all of us.</p>
    <p>Our restau­rant started a move­ment where we would “pay it for­ward”, do­nat­ing one hot meal to The Food Bank Sin­ga­pore with ev­ery $25 cash voucher pur­chased from us. With this move­ment, we add a lit­tle more fuel to the fight against Covid-19. The idea that we can con­trib­ute keeps us go­ing.</p>
    <p>The af­ter­math is go­ing to stretch for years, and our restau­rant may be shut­tered when this is over, but I be­lieve Sin­ga­pore will sur­vive this and will emerge stronger.</p>
    <p>Per­haps global dy­nam­ics will shift and Sin­ga­pore may no longer be as strate­gic a hub as it was pre-Covid-19, but I am con­fi­dent that we, as a peo­ple, will re­build all that we have lost.</p>
