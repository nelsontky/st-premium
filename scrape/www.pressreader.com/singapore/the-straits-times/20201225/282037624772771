    <p>Is there ir­ra­tional ex­u­ber­ance in the lo­cal prop­erty mar­ket with the surge in new home sales, in­crease in pri­vate prop­erty re­sale prices and spec­u­la­tion that the col­lec­tive sale mar­ket will pick up next year?</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­sold units has dropped for six straight quar­ters, while there has been a con­ser­va­tive slate of sites on the Gov­ern­ment Land Sales (GLS) pro­gramme (Talk of en bloc fever flar­ing up again next year, Dec 23; New home sales surge 19 per cent in Nov as devel­op­ers ramp up launches, Dec 16; and Pri­vate re­sale prices up for fourth straight month: SRX, Dec 16).</p>
    <p>If this de­mand and sup­ply mis­match per­sists, we might en­ter another prop­erty bub­ble.</p>
    <p>We are not out of the woods yet from the on­go­ing pan­demic, with a slow­down in busi­ness and un­cer­tain un­em­ploy­ment sit­u­a­tion, yet in­vest­ment in the stock mar­kets and real es­tate con­tin­ues un­abated due to an abun­dance of liq­uid­ity and ul­tra-low in­ter­est rates.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment should in­ten­sify risk as­sess­ment im­me­di­ately, and take nec­es­sary pre­ven­tive and pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures now be­fore it is too late.</p>
    <p>If the de­mand is gen­uinely com­ing from peo­ple who are look­ing to up­grade their homes or buy a new home, then the Gov­ern­ment should ramp up GLS in the next cy­cle to calm the mar­ket, es­pe­cially to re­as­sure those who are wor­ried that they would be priced out of the mar­ket if they don’t act to­day.</p>
    <p>Next, the Gov­ern­ment should cal­i­brate ex­ist­ing prop­erty cool­ing mea­sures and be ready to tighten the clamp should land bids, col­lec­tive sale mar­ket ac­tiv­i­ties and home prices start to trend up­wards.</p>
    <p>In pre­vi­ous prop­erty cool­ing poli­cies, we were quite be­hind the curve. Al­though the red-hot prop­erty fever then has been tamed and prices have sta­bilised, it was a Pyrrhic vic­tory be­cause the prices al­ready scaled to a new height at that time and es­tab­lished a new bench­mark for sub­se­quent prop­erty prices. In­stead of a non-dis­crim­i­na­tory broad-brush ap­proach, the Gov­ern­ment should tar­get non-oc­cu­pier prop­erty pur­chases and loan ser­vice ser­vice­abil­ity to al­low gen­uine oc­cu­pier-buy­ers to pur­chase their dream homes based on their in­come.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic will not go away soon just be­cause of a new vac­cine. Busi­ness re­cov­ery takes time and full em­ploy­ment is a dis­tant goal.</p>
    <p>Un­til we are out of the woods, we have to be wary of a po­ten­tial prop­erty bub­ble burst that will undo all our ef­forts to tackle the pan­demic.</p>
