    <p>HONG KONG • The Hong Kong po­lice’s new na­tional se­cu­rity unit ar­rested eight peo­ple yes­ter­day over a univer­sity protest last month that vi­o­lated a na­tional se­cu­rity law im­posed by China.</p>
    <p>Eight males – i nclud­ing stu­dents, so­cial work­ers and lo­cal district coun­cil­lors – were ar­rested on al­le­ga­tions of par­tic­i­pat­ing in an un­law­ful as­sem­bly on Nov 19 at the Chi­nese Univer­sity of Hong Kong, po­lice told a news con­fer­ence later in the day.</p>
    <p>Three of them were also ac­cused of chant­ing slo­gans, hold­ing up ban­ners or spray-paint­ing mes­sages pro­mot­ing Hong Kong in­de­pen­dence, breach­ing the Chi­nadrafted se­cu­rity law im­posed on the city in June.</p>
    <p>“Through­out the one-hour pro­ces­sion in­side the cam­pus, some of them were shout­ing slo­gans that were pro-Hong Kong i nde­pen­dence and dis­play­ing ban­ners that also in­volved pro-Hong Kong in­de­pen­dence – that’s the rea­son we made the ar­rests,” said Se­nior Su­per­in­ten­dent Steve Li Kwai-wah of the po­lice’s Na­tional Se­cu­rity De­part­ment. He added that “law en­force­ment ac­tion will con­tinue”.</p>
    <p>The cam­pus protest last month saw many stu­dents at­tend their grad­u­a­tion cer­e­mony in yel­low hard hats and gas masks – equip­ment pre­ferred by front-line protesters dur­ing the city’s un­rest last year – along with their tra­di­tional black robes.</p>
    <p>The univer­sity said in a state­ment that it called the po­lice to re­port the protest, which it said dis­rupted a “solemn” grad­u­a­tion cer­e­mony. Po­lice had pre­vi­ously said they were in­ves­ti­gat­ing the protest for sus­pected vi­o­la­tions of the na­tional se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>China’s top leg­isla­tive body had im­posed the mea­sure ban­ning secession, ter­ror­ism, sub­ver­sion and col­lu­sion with for­eign forces on June 30 with­out de­bate by lo­cal law­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>While Chief Executive Car­rie Lam has sought to play down lim­its on con­sti­tu­tion­ally guar­an­teed free­doms of speech and ex­pres­sion, the gov­ern­ment has in­voked the law to ban sup­port for Hong Kong in­de­pen­dence or even more am­bigu­ous slo­gans such as “Lib­er­ate Hong Kong! Revo­lu­tion of our times!”</p>
    <p>Protesters “dis­played ban­ners and flags, as well as chanted slo­gans ad­vo­cat­ing Hong Kong in­de­pen­dence”, and van­dalised the cam­pus with spray paint, po­lice said about the demon­stra­tion last month. The stu­dents also sang</p>
    <p>Glory To Hong Kong, a protest song that the author­i­ties have out­lawed.</p>
    <p>“Po­lice at­tach great im­por­tance to and se­verely con­demn the bla­tant vi­o­la­tion of the na­tional se­cu­rity law and crim­i­nal dam­age at the cam­pus,” the po­lice said at the time.</p>
