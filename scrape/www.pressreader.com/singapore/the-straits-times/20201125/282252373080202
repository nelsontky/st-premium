    <p>A con­flict be­tween some doc­tors and an on­line re­view start-up has been re­solved. Doc­torxDen­tist (DxD), which lists doc­tors and den­tists, and car­ries reviews, fi­nally re­moved the names of those who do not wish to be listed on its web­site.</p>
    <p>“DxD... will only list doc­tors who wish to opt in,” its chief ex­ec­u­tive Tris­tan Hah­ner told The Straits Times on Mon­day. “We have re­moved over 4,700 doc­tor names since Satur­day.”</p>
    <p>This left the site with a list of 500 doc­tors and den­tists, who are work­ing with them to cre­ate free health content, he said. A pro­por­tion of them pay to make their content more vis­i­ble on Google.</p>
    <p>Around 1,100 doc­tors had in­di­cated to the Sin­ga­pore Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion (SMA) that they did not wish to be as­so­ci­ated with the DxD plat­form. On Satur­day, SMA made these names pub­lic on its web­site, as DxD had not delisted them as re­quested.</p>
    <p>The doc­tors had cried foul over be­ing listed with­out their con­sent and not hav­ing the free­dom to opt out. SMA stepped in ear­lier this month to pres­sure DxD to delist doc­tors who wished to opt out of it.</p>
    <p>DxD had said it listed all the prac­ti­tion­ers, us­ing in­for­ma­tion from the web­site of the Sin­ga­pore Med­i­cal Coun­cil (SMC), af­ter con­sult­ing Min­istry of Health (MOH) com­pli­ance of­fi­cers in 2018.</p>
    <p>In a Nov 13 meet­ing that MOH, SMC and SMA held with DxD, the min­istry asked DxD to pub­lish an er­ra­tum on its web­site to say that MOH had not ad­vised it to list the names. SMC asked DxD to re­move all the list­ings by Nov 20.</p>
    <p>When DxD failed to do so, MOH sent a cir­cu­lar over the week­end to doc­tors and den­tists to make clear its stand. It also said DxD had ob­tained doc­tor list­ings from SMC’s web­site with­out SMC’s per­mis­sion and SMC was “ex­plor­ing av­enues of le­gal re­course against DxD”.</p>
    <p>Apart from content and reviews, DxD car­ries rat­ings of doc­tors, and of­fers a book­ing func­tion.</p>
    <p>“Reviews help cus­tomers get a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of what they are buy­ing be­fore they buy. How­ever, in the health­care world, pa­tient sat­is­fac­tion with their health­care provider is not ac­tu­ally cor­re­lated with good out­comes,” said Dr</p>
    <p>Jeremy Lim, direc­tor of global health at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health. “In fact, a study done a cou­ple of years ago seemed to sug­gest that the more sat­is­fied the pa­tient was, the poorer the out­come.”</p>
    <p>In the United States, doc­tors have spo­ken up against sites that at­tempt to re­view them in the same way as a con­sumer would re­view a restau­rant or a ho­tel. “All of us doc­tors, we have our own per­son­al­i­ties. Some of us are more pa­ter­nal­is­tic, some of us share the de­ci­sion­mak­ing much more,” Dr Lim said.</p>
    <p>Such in­for­ma­tion can be use­ful but it is not enough. For in­stance, if a pa­tient has a com­plex dis­ease and needs dif­fi­cult surgery, he would want to know if the doc­tor has done such oper­a­tions be­fore, and what the suc­cess rate is like.</p>
    <p>“My chal­lenge with DxD is I don’t know whether the reviews have been done well,” Dr Lim said. “It sounds like they ac­cept ad­ver­tis­ing dol­lars and we have to ask whether this colours the num­ber of pos­i­tive reviews.”</p>
    <p>He said doc­tors of­ten have rel­a­tives ask­ing them to rec­om­mend a spe­cial­ist. “As doc­tors, we de­cide which of our col­leagues to re­fer to based on ex­pe­ri­ence, fees, per­son­al­ity type... If we can re­pro­duce this for ev­ery pa­tient, then the pub­lic ben­e­fits.”</p>
    <p>Mr Cole Sirucek, who co-founded DocDoc, a Sin­ga­pore-based firm that of­fers in­sur­ance firms, bro­kers and com­pa­nies a pa­tient-doc­tor match­ing ser­vice us­ing an AI-pow­ered plat­form, told ST that the con­sumer is gen­er­ally poorly served in health­care around the world.</p>
    <p>“The way peo­ple buy health­care right now, it would be like walk­ing into a car deal­er­ship and hand­ing the per­son your black Amer­i­can Ex­press card and say­ing I need a car.</p>
    <p>“You have no idea if you’re go­ing to get a Rolls-Royce, a Dai­hatsu Cha­rade or if you’re go­ing to get a Dai­hatsu Cha­rade while pay­ing for a Rolls-Royce,” said Mr Sirucek.</p>
    <p>“A lot of peo­ple are see­ing this and think­ing there’s got to be an op­por­tu­nity there.”</p>
