    <p>• Healthy ath­letes should take their place in the Covid-19 vac­cine queue be­hind peo­ple with more press­ing needs de­spite events such as the Olympic Games look­ing set to be highly de­pen­dent on com­peti­tors ar­riv­ing free from the virus, said the head of World Ath­let­ics Se­bas­tian Coe.</p>
    <p>Most ath­letes in their 20s and 30s, across all sports, would be just about last in line in most coun­tries when it comes to hand­ing out the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>But the pres­sure to cre­ate a Covid-safe en­vi­ron­ment at sport­ing events has raised the ques­tion of whether they should be treated as a spe­cial case.</p>
    <p>Coe trod a care­ful line when asked about the is­sue at a me­dia con­fer­ence on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“We have to be sen­si­tive here – there are many claims on that pri­or­ity,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Most of us are de­pen­dent on our front-line work­ers and our emer­gency ser­vices and we also recog­nise that there are vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple in the com­mu­nity and we want to make sure that we look af­ter them as much as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“I’m not sure that it is for sport to be press­ing the case for fit young peo­ple. I would like, on the other hand, that when the vac­cine does be­come avail­able and that the ath­letes have the op­por­tu­nity to make use of it that they do.”</p>
    <p>Coe was also con­fi­dent next year’s July 23-Aug 8 Tokyo Games would go ahead.</p>
    <p>“I was in Tokyo a week ago and spent 48 very in­ten­sive hours talk­ing to the or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee and the gov­ern­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>“There is a cast-iron de­ter­mi­na­tion to stage the Games, though there is a recog­ni­tion that we are still in un­cer­tain ter­ri­tory.”</p>
