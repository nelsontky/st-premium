    <p>•</p>
    <p>Af­ter suc­cess­fully com­plet­ing last sea­son in an Or­lando bub­ble, teams will be trav­el­ling again and play­ers, coaches and staff test­ing pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus could be in­evitable.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) sea­son, which starts to­mor­row, has al­ready been re­duced from 82 to 72 games be­cause of the pan­demic and the league will try to com­plete its 16-team play-offs be­tween May 22 and July 22.</p>
    <p>Three teams – At­lanta Hawks, Utah Jazz, and Mem­phis Griz­zlies – have said they will al­low a lim­ited num­ber of fans into their are­nas but the real bat­tle will be keep­ing the virus out.</p>
    <p>Asked what would be the de­ter­min­ing fac­tor in a team’s suc­cess this sea­son, Dal­las Mav­er­icks All­Star guard Luka Don­cic be­lieves who­ever can main­tain a low rate of in­fec­tion will have a greater ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>“Which team is not go­ing to have (Covid-19) pos­i­tive peo­ple,” he added.</p>
    <p>With no bub­ble to pro­tect its par­tic­i­pants, the NBA is count­ing on daily test­ing of play­ers, coaches and team staff mem­bers, vig­i­lant mask-wear­ing and so­cial dis­tanc­ing, and an ex­panded book of health and safety guide­lines to get through the win­ter.</p>
    <p>All 30 teams will also have a league-as­signed “pro­to­col of­fi­cer” with them on the road and on team planes, try­ing to en­sure ad­her­ence to the many re­stric­tions out­lined within the league’s nearly 160 pages of rules to gov­ern the sea­son.</p>
    <p>But Amer­i­can pub­lic health ex­perts project next month to be the most dev­as­tat­ing month yet as the world’s worst-hit coun­try bat­tles against the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Dr An­thony Fauci, the United States’ top in­fec­tious disease ex­pert, re­cently pre­dicted that ac­cess to a Covid-19 vac­cine should be wide­spread na­tion­ally by late spring or early sum­mer.</p>
    <p>The months un­til then, how­ever, could be grim – some­thing the NBA has es­sen­tially ac­knowl­edged by re­leas­ing only the first half of its reg­u­lar-sea­son sched­ule, till March 4.</p>
    <p>The league of­fice wants to main­tain cal­en­dar flex­i­bil­ity to deal with the sort of coro­n­avirus-re­lated dis­rup­tions that have up­ended other sports, such as the Na­tional Foot­ball League, which have not em­ployed bub­bles.</p>
    <p>“We know there are go­ing to be chal­lenges and bumps, but so far things are good, and we’re op­ti­mistic that we have a plan that we can work through those chal­lenges and bumps,” said David Weiss, the NBA’s vice-pres­i­dent of player mat­ters.</p>
