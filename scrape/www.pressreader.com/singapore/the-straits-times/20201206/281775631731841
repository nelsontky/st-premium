    <p>TOKYO • Call it a spe­cial de­liv­ery: Af­ter six years in space, Ja­pan’s Hayabusa-2 probe is head­ing home, but only to drop off its rare as­teroid sam­ples be­fore start­ing a new mis­sion.</p>
    <p>The fridge-sized space probe, launched in De­cem­ber 2014, has al­ready thrilled sci­en­tists by land­ing on and gath­er­ing ma­te­rial from an as­teroid 300 mil­lion kilo­me­tres from Earth. But its work is far from over, with sci­en­tists from Jaxa (Ja­pan Aerospace Ex­plo­ration Agency) plan­ning to ex­tend its mis­sion for more than a decade and tar­get­ing two new as­teroids.</p>
    <p>Be­fore that, Hayabusa-2 has to drop off its pre­cious sam­ples from the as­teroid Ryugu – “dragon palace” in Ja­panese.</p>
    <p>“The probe is now in a very good con­di­tion,” project man­ager Yuichi Tsuda said on Fri­day, hail­ing its re­turn as a “rare event in hu­man his­tory”.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists are hop­ing it will bring around 0.1 gram of ma­te­rial that will of­fer clues about what the so­lar sys­tem was like at its birth some 4.6 bil­lion years ago.</p>
    <p>The sam­ples could shed light on “how mat­ter is scat­tered around the so­lar sys­tem, why it ex­ists on the as­teroid and how it is re­lated to Earth”, Mr Tsuda said, ahead of to­day’s drop-off in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>The ma­te­rial is in a cap­sule that will sep­a­rate from Hayabusa-2 while it is some 220,000km above Earth and then plum­met into the south­ern Aus­tralian desert.</p>
    <p>The sam­ples were col­lected dur­ing two cru­cial phases of the mis­sion last year. In the first, Hayabusa-2 touched down on Ryugu to col­lect dust be­fore fir­ing an “im­pactor” to stir up pris­tine ma­te­rial from be­low the sur­face.</p>
    <p>Months later, it touched down to col­lect ad­di­tional sam­ples.</p>
    <p>“We may be able to get sub­stances that will give us clues to the birth of a planet and the ori­gin of life... I’m very in­ter­ested to see the sub­stances,” mis­sion man­ager Makoto Yoshikawa told re­porters.</p>
    <p>Pro­tected from sun­light and ra­di­a­tion in­side the cap­sule, the sam­ples will be col­lected, pro­cessed, then flown to Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>Af­ter drop­ping off its sam­ples, Hayabusa-2 will com­plete a se­ries of or­bits around the Sun for around six years – record­ing data on dust in in­ter­plan­e­tary space and ob­serv­ing ex­o­plan­ets.</p>
    <p>It will then ap­proach the first of its tar­get as­teroids in July 2026. The probe will not get that close to the as­teroid named 2001 CC21, but sci­en­tists hope it will be able to pho­to­graph it as it com­pletes a “high speed fly-by”.</p>
    <p>Get­ting so close could help de­velop knowl­edge about how to pro­tect Earth against as­teroid im­pact.</p>
    <p>Hayabusa-2 will then head to­wards its main tar­get, 1998 KY26, a ball-shaped as­teroid with a di­am­e­ter of just 30m.</p>
    <p>When the probe ar­rives at the as­teroid in July 2031, it will be about 300 mil­lion km from Earth.</p>
    <p>And the tar­get poses sig­nif­i­cant new chal­lenges, not least be­cause it is spin­ning rapidly, ro­tat­ing on its axis about every 10 min­utes.</p>
    <p>Hayabusa-2 will ob­serve and pho­to­graph the as­teroid, but it is un­likely to land and col­lect sam­ples, as it prob­a­bly will not have enough fuel to re­turn them to Earth.</p>
    <p>Still, just mak­ing it to the as­teroid will be a feat, said Nagoya Univer­sity’s pro­fes­sor of plan­e­tary sci­ence Sei­ichiro Watan­abe, a Hayabusa-2 probe project sci­en­tist</p>
    <p>“It’s like an ath­lete who scored two tries at a Rugby World Cup game at­tempt­ing to com­pete in the Olympics, 10 years af­ter switch­ing over to fig­ure skat­ing,” he told re­porters. “We had never ex­pected that the Hayabusa-2 would carry out an­other mis­sion... but it’s a sci­en­tif­i­cally mean­ing­ful and fas­ci­nat­ing plan.”</p>
