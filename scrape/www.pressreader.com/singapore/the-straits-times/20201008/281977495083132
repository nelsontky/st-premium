    <p>Fincy, a Sin­ga­pore-based cur­rency ex­change and pay­ment ap­pli­ca­tion, is ex­it­ing a con­tro­ver­sial de­vel­op­ment in Myan­mar ac­cused of fa­cil­i­tat­ing il­le­gal on­line gam­bling.</p>
    <p>In an e-mailed state­ment yes­ter­day, it said it was “pulling out of Yatai City fol­low­ing a se­ries of press ar­ti­cles which al­leged that it was be­ing used to pre­vent law en­force­ment from track­ing fi­nan­cial trans­ac­tions in the city”.</p>
    <p>It added: “Fincy re­futes all claims of ne­far­i­ous deal­ings and holds zero tol­er­ance for il­le­gal ac­tiv­i­ties and un­eth­i­cal prac­tices.”</p>
    <p>Prior to this, Fincy had on Google’s Play Store touted it­self as “the ex­clu­sive provider of fi­nan­cial ser­vices in Yatai City” in Myan­mar’s Kayin state. Ac­cord­ing to Fincy’s co-founder Dou­glas Gan, it was used to pay salaries and mer­chants within the de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>A check on the Google Play Store yes­ter­day showed Fincy had re­moved any ref­er­ence to Yatai City.</p>
    <p>The US$15 bil­lion (S$20.4 bil­lion) Yatai City, also called Shwe Kokko New City and lo­cated close to the Thai-Myan­mar bor­der, is un­der probe by the Myan­mar gov­ern­ment. China, on Aug 25, dis­tanced it­self from the de­vel­op­ment, say­ing it “is a third-coun­try in­vest­ment and has noth­ing to do with the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive”.</p>
    <p>The project is be­ing jointly de­vel­oped by a com­pany owned by for­mer mili­tia mem­bers, and Yatai In­ter­na­tional Hold­ing Group. The lat­ter en­tity is headed by China-born busi­ness­man She Zhi­jiang, who re­port­edly ob­tained Cam­bo­dian cit­i­zen­ship in 2017.</p>
    <p>Yatai, in its pro­mo­tional ma­te­rial, has billed Yatai City as a 12,000ha project with in­dus­trial and en­ter­tain­ment zones pow­ered by blockchain-based in­fras­truc­ture and trans­ac­tions. It has also cited casi­nos as a top source of its rev­enue, de­spite the Myan­mar gov­ern­ment not hav­ing li­censed any casino in Kayin state.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cially, Yatai has ap­proval to build only vil­las worth US$22.5 mil­lion on 10ha of land.</p>
    <p>Yatai City was high­lighted by the US Congress-funded United States In­sti­tute of Peace in its July report, which warned that “com­plex transna­tional net­works of Chi­nese in­vestors, forced out of Cam­bo­dia for il­le­gal gam­bling ac­tiv­ity, are re­lo­cat­ing to Karen state to build three megac­i­ties as a hub for casi­nos”.</p>
    <p>Karen state is the for­mer name of Kayin state.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese em­bassy in Myan­mar said in Au­gust that “Chi­nese cap­i­tal is not al­lowed to in­vest in for­eign casi­nos, Chi­nese cit­i­zens are not al­lowed to par­tic­i­pate in for­eign casino oper­a­tions, and for­eign casi­nos are not al­lowed to at­tract Chi­nese cit­i­zens to gam­ble”. It also said China was tight­en­ing co­op­er­a­tion with Myan­mar on law en­force­ment.</p>
    <p>Yatai has de­nied op­er­at­ing il­le­gal casi­nos. It is­sued a state­ment on WeChat that some of its ten­ant com­pa­nies may have hid­den im­proper oper­a­tions. It also blamed its own man­age­ment in­ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Yatai said it plans to launch a “twin city” next year across the bor­der in Thai­land’s Mae Sot district that fo­cuses on the med­i­cal in­dus­try.</p>
