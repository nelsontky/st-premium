    <p>The num­ber of se­niors ty­ing the knot has been in­creas­ing steadily in the past decade.</p>
    <p>Last year, 514 men aged 60 and older wed – al­most 60 per cent more than the 324 grooms in that age group in 2009.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 124 women aged 60 and older be­came brides last year, al­most triple the 46 in 2009.</p>
    <p>More than half of the se­niors aged 60 and older who wed last year are divorcees.</p>
    <p>The rest are ei­ther sin­gle or wid­owed, ac­cord­ing to the data con­tained in the Sta­tis­tics on Mar­riages and Di­vorces 2019.</p>
    <p>This was pub­lished by the Depart­ment of Sta­tis­tics and re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>So­ci­ol­o­gist Tan Ern Ser said more se­niors are mar­ry­ing as they are still phys­i­cally and fi­nan­cially healthy even at an older age.</p>
    <p>Fo­cus on the Fam­ily prin­ci­pal coun­sel­lor Theresa Pong said an­other rea­son is that se­nior cit­i­zens have a strong de­sire for com­pan­ion­ship, and that age is less of a bar­rier to mar­riage to them than one’s per­cep­tion of the qual­ity of mar­riage and re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>She added: “While cul­ture is evolv­ing, what re­mains time­less and key to re­silient mar­riages is that cou­ples are able to com­mu­ni­cate their ex­pec­ta­tions and needs and are com­mit­ted to work­ing through con­flict and dif­fer­ences in every life stage.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, though most grooms are older than their wives, more women are mar­ry­ing younger men.</p>
    <p>The pro­por­tion of first mar­riages where the bride is older than the groom rose from 16 per cent in 2009 to 18.3 per cent last year.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan noted that age is less of a bar­rier when it comes to mar­ry­ing later th­ese days for most cou­ples, and that phys­i­cal at­trac­tion and wealth could also com­pen­sate for age.</p>
    <p>There is also greater so­cial ac­cep­tance of women mar­ry­ing a younger men, he added.</p>
