    <p>I was re­cently asked by the In­vest Editor to give an in­ter­view for the Me And My Money col­umn.</p>
    <p>Why me, I thought? I’m ter­ri­ble with numbers and have no sense for busi­ness. I know noth­ing about bonds or Reits or even how to buy a US stock.</p>
    <p>Em­bar­rassed, I de­clined as I felt I didn’t have any ad­vice or fi­nan­cial pearls to share with read­ers. Af­ter all, I’m not in the fi­nance line, have no real in­vest­ment knowl­edge and I wouldn’t even know how to take a sum of money and grow it in a mean­ing­ful way. I thought I did when I was young but now, in hind­sight, I re­alise I didn’t. They were mere pipe dreams.</p>
    <p>But for what it’s worth, I think there are lessons to be learnt from my litany of fail­ures and thwarted at­tempts to get rich. In my 40 years of adult life, I have been scammed and cheated, gullibly fallen into in­vest­ment traps so many times, and taken aw­ful ad­vice from pri­vate bankers.</p>
    <p>I have lost so much money that it’s just not funny. I may not be able to tell you how to in­vest but per­haps I can tell you how not to in­vest and what you shouldn’t do.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing my teenage years in the 1970s, I wit­nessed my mother and grand­fa­ther ac­tively play­ing the stock mar­ket. I use the term “play­ing” as they didn’t have any fi­nan­cial back­ground or sound in­vest­ment strat­egy.</p>
    <p>It was a big casino to them. All they did was lis­ten to friends who had “hot tips” and bought shares in a hap­haz­ard, emo­tion­ally charged way.</p>
    <p>They didn’t re­ally un­der­stand the fun­da­men­tals and how stocks can be ma­nip­u­lated. They fell vic­tim to the stock mar­ket crash of 1973 and it took us decades to re­cover from that crash.</p>
    <p>When I grad­u­ated and be­came a house­man in 1984, my first pay packet was $1,250. I used a small amount to pay for an in­sur­ance pol­icy which I promptly gave up af­ter a year as I didn’t think it made sense.</p>
    <p>I man­aged to save most of the rest and what did I do? I used it to buy some shares, think­ing that I knew better than my folks.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, I knew what price-to-earn­ings ratio was, and a good friend was a remisier with his ear to the ground. I was sure his tips would be good.</p>
    <p>I’d also read about Roth­schild’s in­vest­ment prin­ci­ple of “sell 10 per cent up and buy 10 per cent down”. If I stuck to these ba­sic steps, I’d surely make a bomb.</p>
    <p>Wrong. I lost ev­ery­thing I’d earned in the crash of 1987. In 1989, I didn’t even have suf­fi­cient funds left to travel to Eng­land to take my sur­gi­cal ex­ams. Luck­ily, an uncle of mine gave me a sum of money that en­abled me to do so.</p>
    <p>In the 1990s, as a mid­dle-ranked doctor, I was mak­ing a bit more money and, to­gether with a small sum left to me when my grand­fa­ther died, I put down a deposit for a small shop­house in a con­ser­va­tion area. I had to take a loan for the re­main­ing 80 per cent of the pur­chase price.</p>
    <p>When I re­alised that I’d be paying back the loan over the next 30 years, I thought that there had to be a better way of ac­cel­er­at­ing this.</p>
    <p>Stupidly, I played the stock mar­ket again. This time, it would be dif­fer­ent, I told my­self. I had pri­vate bankers and surely they would give me good ad­vice and mul­ti­ply my money.</p>
    <p>Wrong again. Upon their ad­vice, I bought stocks they had guar­an­teed would reap div­i­dends even for my grand­chil­dren and ac­quired a sub­stan­tial amount of Malaysian Clob shares which were en­joy­ing a bull run.</p>
    <p>When the stock mar­ket col­lapsed in 1998, I was truly clob­bered. I lost ev­ery­thing – again. This time, sev­eral hun­dreds of thou­sands of dol­lars. I felt like an id­iot.</p>
    <p>In­ter­est­ingly, at about the same time, I vis­ited a for­tune teller on one of my con­fer­ence trips to</p>
    <p>New York. She was a gypsy lady and had a pack of tarot cards in front of her from which she read my fu­ture. She cor­rectly pre­dicted I would marry the woman I was trav­el­ling with and that we would have two chil­dren.</p>
    <p>She also told me that I would never be rich, just com­fort­able, and that the only way I could earn money was with my hands and what­ever skills I had as a doctor.</p>
    <p>She said I must never in­vest in busi­nesses, stocks or any­thing that re­motely looked like gam­bling. I would lose it all, she warned. The only thing I should in­vest in is prop­erty, she said as her fi­nal words of ad­vice.</p>
    <p>From that day on, I vowed never to touch stocks or lis­ten to a pri­vate banker again. With my mind freed from look­ing at stock mar­ket up­dates and mak­ing sur­rep­ti­tious calls to my bro­ker, I would just put my nose to the grind­stone and con­cen­trate on my ca­reer.</p>
    <p>And save. In 2000, I opened my own pri­vate clinic and did what I know how to do best – look af­ter pa­tients.</p>
    <p>When the ter­ri­ble Lehman Broth­ers fi­nan­cial cri­sis oc­curred in 2008, my friends and col­leagues – and I’m sure many other peo­ple world­wide – who were heav­ily in­vested in the mar­ket thought the world had col­lapsed.</p>
    <p>I felt so sorry for them. But I was un­scathed be­cause I had no more in­vest­ments. In­stead, op­por­tu­ni­ties arose and I man­aged to pur­chase sev­eral choice prop­er­ties at rea­son­able prices and I now de­rive a small rental in­come from them. The gypsy lady had been right.</p>
    <p>The moral of this story is that you just need to rely on your­self, make the best of what you have, and be mod­est in your out­look on life.</p>
    <p>For­get about in­stant riches. Work and save. There re­ally are no “get rich quick” schemes. Most are scams and cons. Why on earth would any­one want to make money for you if there is noth­ing in it for them?</p>
    <p>Don’t be­lieve ev­ery­thing you hear.</p>
