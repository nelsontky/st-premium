    <p>SEOUL • At the age of 93, the arc of South Korean tele­vi­sion host Song Hae’s life mir­rors that of his coun­try, from Ja­panese colo­nial­ism to war to cul­tural rise, che­quered by suf­fer­ing and loss.</p>
    <p>Song is known across the South as the host of Na­tional Sing­ing Con­test, a tal­ent show broad­cast from a dif­fer­ent lo­ca­tion each week that has been run­ning for 40 years and re­mains pop­u­lar.</p>
    <p>His warm and funny personalit­y has earned him a huge fan base, from chil­dren to teenagers to the el­derly, and the lo­ca­tions named af­ter him in­clude a street in Seoul and a park in Daegu.</p>
    <p>But Song was born in to­day’s North Korea and was among the mil­lions of peo­ple whose fam­i­lies were left di­vided by the Korean War – which he played a part in end­ing when he re­layed the or­der to cease fire.</p>
    <p>“My gen­er­a­tion lived i n very hap­less times,” Song told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>His ex­tra­or­di­nary life is fea­tured in a doc­u­men­tary that has its world pre­miere at the Bu­san film fes­ti­val, Asia’s largest, this week.</p>
    <p>Di­rected by the award-win­ning Jero Yun, Song Hae 1927 fo­cuses on Song’s pri­vate grief and the tur­moil of his fam­ily his­tory – as well as be­ing sep­a­rated from his par­ents and sib­lings by the war, his only son was killed in a traf­fic ac­ci­dent at the age of 23.</p>
    <p>“Mr Song is a sur­vivor,” said Yun, who has pre­vi­ously tack­led themes of mi­gra­tion and North Korean de­fec­tors. “My ques­tion for this pro­ject was, how do we deal with the holes in our mind when we lose some­one?”</p>
    <p>Born as Song Bok-hee in 1927 in Jaery­ong, in what is now the North, Song grew up dur­ing the Ja­panese colo­nial era, when he re­mem­bers be­ing beaten for speak­ing Korean and spend­ing gru­elling hours cut­ting hay to feed Ja­panese cav­al­ry­men’s horses.</p>
    <p>“I still have a scar on my leg from those days, from cut­ting my­self while us­ing a sickle,” he said.</p>
    <p>He stud­ied sing­ing at mu­sic school and once hos­til­i­ties broke out, he reg­u­larly stayed away from home to avoid be­ing con­scripted into the North’s forces.</p>
    <p>On one oc­ca­sion, his mother called him back as he was leav­ing. “She told me, ‘Be care­ful this time.’ So I just told her, ‘I’m com­ing back in two days.’”</p>
    <p>It was the last time they ever spoke. With North Korean forces ad­vanc­ing, he sought shel­ter on a United States war­ship evac­u­at­ing civil­ians to the South.</p>
    <p>He spent most of the three-day jour­ney star­ing at the open wa­ters, not know­ing if he would ever be able to re­turn home, and later re­named him­self Hae – mean­ing</p>
    <p>“sea” – to re­mem­ber the voy­age that for­ever sep­a­rated him from his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>In the South, Song be­came a mil­i­tary sig­naller, and said that he and his col­leagues later trans­mit­ted the en­coded mes­sage that ended hos­til­i­ties and sealed the di­vi­sion of the penin­sula.</p>
    <p>“We later learnt it meant, ‘As of 2200 on July 27, 1953, fight­ing on all front lines will cease,’” he lamented. “It was me who sent it, and even now I still can’t re­turn.”</p>
    <p>In the sub­se­quent decades, South Korea has un­der­gone an eco­nomic boom while en­dur­ing au­thor­i­tar­ian mil­i­tary govern­ments from the 1960s to the 1980s – Song was once in­ter­ro­gated for three days for com­plain­ing about hard­ships.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has gone on to es­tab­lish it­self as a vi­brant democ­racy and a tech­no­log­i­cal and en­ter­tain­ment pow­er­house.</p>
    <p>He made a ca­reer as a singer, co­me­dian and tele­vi­sion personalit­y, and spent 17 years host­ing a ra­dio show do­ing traf­fic re­ports, un­til his son Chang-jin was killed in a mo­tor­cy­cle crash.</p>
    <p>“I just couldn’t say ‘be care­ful of car ac­ci­dents’ on air af­ter los­ing my son that way,” he said.</p>
    <p>In 1988, he took over as the Na­tional Sing­ing Con­test host – some­what in­con­gru­ously, given that he had dis­cour­aged Chang-jin from pur­su­ing a mu­si­cal ca­reer.</p>
    <p>At the time, pro­fes­sional singers like him were l ooked down on so­cially, and he fol­lowed the ex­am­ple of his own fa­ther, who had also sought to dis­suade him.</p>
    <p>“It’s a sin for a fa­ther to not un­der­stand what his child is go­ing through,” he said, wip­ing away tears.</p>
    <p>Song has since hosted al­most 1,500 episodes of the show from ev­ery part of the South, and one in­stal­ment in Py­ongyang, dur­ing the Sun­shine Pol­icy rap­proche­ment of the early 2000s.</p>
    <p>But he was un­able to visit his home town, pay his re­spects at his pre­sum­ably long-dead par­ents’ graves, nor meet the sis­ter he had left be­hind, and cried through­out the jour­ney back to Seoul.</p>
    <p>Un­re­solved feel­ings of sad­ness and re­sent­ment against in­jus­tice, known as “han”, are a long­stand­ing theme in Korean cul­ture and lit­er­a­ture.</p>
    <p>Song said: “Even an en­tire day would not be enough to count the things that I find to be filled with han.”</p>
