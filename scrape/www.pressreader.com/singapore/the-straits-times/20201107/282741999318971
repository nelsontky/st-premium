    <p>RACE 1 (1,650M)</p>
    <p>4 Won­der­ful Tiger won third-up last cam­paign. He gets an ex­cel­lent chance to re­peat with a lovely run from Gate 1 for Chad Schofield.</p>
    <p>1 Hum­ble Steed re­turns to Class 5, where he is a two-time win­ner. He just has to over­come a wide draw.</p>
    <p>5 Smil­ing Suc­cess gets a favourable draw which should al­low him to find the front with ease. 10 Vir­tus Star is next best, off the back of a tidy last-start win.</p>
    <p>RACE 2 (1,800M)</p>
    <p>4 Shadow Breaker has led and won over this course and dis­tance. There is ev­ery like­li­hood he will try to do the same from a good draw.</p>
    <p>12 Nunchuks has held his form up in class. He rates strongly with a good gate and a light weight.</p>
    <p>7 In­dige­nous Star draws awk­wardly this time. But he does get cham­pion jockey Zac Pur­ton.</p>
    <p>2 Mag­netism is next best.</p>
    <p>RACE 3 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>6 My Ec­static has tri­alled well. With even luck, he looks a lead­ing player first-up.</p>
    <p>5 Good Shot won sec­ond-up last term. He mixes his form, but does have plenty of abil­ity on his day.</p>
    <p>10 Coura­geous Dragon is look­ing to go one bet­ter, af­ter fin­ish­ing sec­ond last start. He has drawn well.</p>
    <p>8 Shin­ing On is rac­ing well. He should not be too far away.</p>
    <p>RACE 4 (1,000M)</p>
    <p>8 Win­ner’s Heart looks ready to fire in what ap­pears to be a suit­able race.</p>
    <p>2 Mo­men­tum Galaxy strug­gled to make ground last start, but his win be­fore that was ex­cel­lent.</p>
    <p>10 Travel Datuk is win­less from 44 at­tempts, but is a solid earner for con­nec­tions.</p>
    <p>4 Wild West Wing won with plenty in hand last start. He rates strongly with the good gate.</p>
    <p>RACE 5 (1,650M)</p>
    <p>7 King Dragon has abil­ity. He is near­ing a win with two top-three ef­forts.</p>
    <p>9 Daily Beauty gets a good gate. He de­serves re­spect.</p>
    <p>2 Villa Fionn is rac­ing well. He should be able to score off his cur­rent fig­ure.</p>
    <p>8 Univer­sal Go Go has drawn poorly, but is in solid enough form to war­rant re­spect.</p>
    <p>RACE 6 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>8 Wins All closed in last start to sug­gest that he could mea­sure up in this grade with a pos­i­tive ride.</p>
    <p>1 Kinda Cool is a tal­ent who ap­pears to have plenty of rat­ing points in hand.</p>
    <p>2 Sim­ply Fluke is con­sis­tent. He should get his chance.</p>
    <p>4 Lucky Qual­ity rarely runs a bad race. He can fin­ish around the mark.</p>
    <p>RACE 7 (1,650M)</p>
    <p>9 Wealthy De­light has shown im­prove­ment. He looks primed to take an­other step for­ward.</p>
    <p>3 Holy Heart is a lightly raced tal­ent. He seems bet­ter on dirt, but he can fig­ure with the right run.</p>
    <p>2 Un­cle Steve mixes his form. But, on his day, he can be ul­tra-im­pres­sive. He is worth con­sid­er­ing.</p>
    <p>6 Jolly Hon­our, a two-time course-and-dis­tance win­ner, de­serves re­spect.</p>
    <p>RACE 8 (1,000M)</p>
    <p>10 We The South can find the front and take plenty of catch­ing from the in­side draw.</p>
    <p>9 Fab­u­lous Eight missed nar­rowly last time. Off that run, he must be re­spected.</p>
    <p>8 Heart Con­quered is not too far away from a first Hong Kong win. The wide draw is awk­ward though. 3 Har­mony And Rich is lightly raced and on the up. He bears close watch­ing.</p>
    <p>RACE 9 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>4 Chicken Dance has re­turned well from a ten­don in­jury with two com­pet­i­tive ef­forts. He is ca­pa­ble of tak­ing this race.</p>
    <p>8 Ares is look­ing for back-to-back wins. He can find the front and play catch me if you can.</p>
    <p>11 Takingu fur­ther mixes his form but is ca­pa­ble on his day. The light weight suits.</p>
    <p>1 Cal­i­for­nia deep shot just needs to shoul­der the big weight.</p>
    <p>RACE 10 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>3 Gun­ni­son ran a blinder last start. If he has come on, he rates as a lead­ing player.</p>
    <p>4 Good Luck Friend is a supreme tal­ent look­ing for his fifth Hong Kong win at his ninth start.</p>
    <p>6 All In Mind is look­ing to snap a streak of two run­ner-up ef­forts. He caught the eye in his re­cent trial.</p>
    <p>1 Shin­ing Ace is next best. He has had the ben­e­fit of two runs this cam­paign.</p>
