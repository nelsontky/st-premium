    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON Just as vac­cines be­gin to of­fer hope for a path out of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, of­fi­cials in Bri­tain this past week­end sounded an ur­gent alarm about what they called a highly con­ta­gious new vari­ant of the coro­n­avirus cir­cu­lat­ing in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>In South Africa, a sim­i­lar ver­sion of the virus has emerged, shar­ing one of the mu­ta­tions seen in the Bri­tish vari­ant, ac­cord­ing to the sci­en­tists who de­tected it.</p>
    <p>That virus has been found in up to 90 per cent of the sam­ples whose ge­netic se­quences have been an­a­lysed i n South Africa since the mid­dle of last month.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists are wor­ried about th­ese vari­ants but not sur­prised.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers have recorded thou­sands of tiny mod­i­fi­ca­tions in the ge­netic ma­te­rial of the coro­n­avirus as it has hopped across the world.</p>
    <p>Some vari­ants be­come more com­mon in a pop­u­la­tion sim­ply by luck, not be­cause the changes some­how su­per­charge the virus.</p>
    <p>But as it be­comes more dif­fi­cult for the pathogen to sur­vive – due to vac­ci­na­tions and grow­ing im­mu­nity in hu­man pop­u­la­tions – re­searchers also ex­pect the virus to gain use­ful mu­ta­tions en­abling it to spread more eas­ily or to es­cape de­tec­tion by the im­mune sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“It’s a real warn­ing that we need to pay closer at­ten­tion,” said Dr Jesse Bloom, an evo­lu­tion­ary bi­ol­o­gist at the Fred Hutchin­son Can­cer Re­search Cen­tre in Seat­tle. “Th­ese mu­ta­tions are go­ing to spread, and def­i­nitely, the sci­en­tific com­mu­nity, we need to mon­i­tor th­ese mu­ta­tions, and we need to char­ac­terise which ones have ef­fects.”</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish vari­ant has about 20 mu­ta­tions, in­clud­ing sev­eral that af­fect how the virus locks onto hu­man cells and in­fects them.</p>
    <p>Dr Muge Ce­vik, an in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­pert at the Univer­sity of St An­drews in Scot­land and a sci­en­tific ad­viser to the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment, said th­ese mu­ta­tions may al­low the vari­ant to repli­cate and trans­mit more ef­fi­ciently.</p>
    <p>But the es­ti­mate of greater trans­mis­si­bil­ity – Bri­tish of­fi­cials said the vari­ant was as much as 70 per cent more trans­mis­si­ble – is based on mod­el­ling and has not been con­firmed in lab ex­per­i­ments, said Dr Ce­vik.</p>
    <p>“We can’t en­tirely rule out the fact that some of this trans­mis­si­bil­ity data might be re­lated to hu­man be­hav­iour,” she said.</p>
    <p>In South Africa, too, sci­en­tists were quick to note that hu­man be­hav­iour was driv­ing the epi­demic, not nec­es­sar­ily the new mu­ta­tions whose ef­fect on trans­mis­si­bil­ity had yet to be quan­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish an­nounce­ment also prompted con­cern that the virus might evolve to be­come re­sis­tant to the vac­cines just now rolling out.</p>
    <p>The worries are fo­cused on a pair of al­ter­ations in the vi­ral ge­netic code that may make it less vul­ner­a­ble to cer­tain an­ti­bod­ies.</p>
    <p>But sev­eral ex­perts urged cau­tion, say­ing it would take years for the virus to evolve enough to ren­der the cur­rent vac­cines im­po­tent.</p>
    <p>Said Dr Bloom: “No one should worry that there is go­ing to be a sin­gle cat­a­strophic mu­ta­tion that sud­denly ren­ders all im­mu­nity and an­ti­bod­ies use­less.</p>
    <p>“It is go­ing to be a process that oc­curs over the time scale of mul­ti­ple years and re­quires the ac­cu­mu­la­tion of mul­ti­ple vi­ral mu­ta­tions. It’s not go­ing to be like an on-off switch.”</p>
    <p>Like all viruses, the coro­n­avirus is a shape-shifter. Some ge­netic changes are in­con­se­quen­tial, but some may give it an edge.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists fear the lat­ter pos­sibil­ity es­pe­cially.</p>
    <p>The vac­ci­na­tion of mil­lions may force the virus to new adap­ta­tions, mu­ta­tions that help it evade or re­sist the im­mune re­sponse.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, there are small changes in the virus that have arisen in­de­pen­dently mul­ti­ple times across the world, sug­gest­ing the mu­ta­tions are help­ful to the pathogen.</p>
    <p>The mu­ta­tion af­fect­ing an­ti­body sus­cep­ti­bil­ity is tech­ni­cally called the 69-70 dele­tion, mean­ing there are miss­ing let­ters in the ge­netic code. The dele­tion changes the spike pro­tein on the sur­face of the coro­n­avirus, which it needs to in­fect hu­man cells.</p>
    <p>The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vac­cines in­duce an im­mune re­sponse only to the spike pro­tein car­ried by the coro­n­avirus on its sur­face. But each in­fected per­son pro­duces a large, unique and com­plex reper­toire of an­ti­bod­ies to this pro­tein.</p>
    <p>“The fact is that you have a thou­sand big guns pointed at the virus,” said Dr Kar­tik Chan­dran, a virus ex­pert at the Al­bert Ein­stein Col­lege of Medicine in New York.</p>
    <p>“No mat­ter how the virus twists and weaves, it’s not that easy to find a ge­netic so­lu­tion that can re­ally com­bat all th­ese dif­fer­ent an­ti­body speci­fici­ties.”</p>
    <p>In short: It will be very hard for the coro­n­avirus to es­cape the body’s de­fences, de­spite the many vari­a­tions it may adopt.</p>
    <p>Es­cape from im­mu­nity re­quires that a virus ac­cu­mu­late a se­ries of mu­ta­tions, each al­low­ing the pathogen to erode the ef­fec­tive­ness of the body’s de­fences.</p>
    <p>Some viruses, like in­fluenza, amass those changes rel­a­tively quickly. But oth­ers, like the measles virus, col­lect hardly any of the al­ter­ations.</p>
    <p>Dr Bloom noted that even the flu virus needs five to seven years to col­lect enough mu­ta­tions to es­cape im­mune recog­ni­tion en­tirely.</p>
    <p>The scale of the in­fec­tions in this pan­demic may be quickly gen­er­at­ing di­ver­sity in the new coro­n­avirus. Still, a vast ma­jor­ity of peo­ple world­wide have yet to be in­fected, and that has made sci­en­tists hope­ful.</p>
    <p>Univer­sity of Bern molec­u­lar pub­lic health re­searcher Emma Hod­croft said: “It would be a lit­tle sur­pris­ing to me if we were see­ing ac­tive se­lec­tion for im­mune es­cape.... In a pop­u­la­tion that’s still mostly naive, the virus just doesn’t need to do that yet.”</p>
    <p>Im­mu­nis­ing about 60 per cent of a pop­u­la­tion within about a year and keep­ing the num­ber of cases down while that hap­pens will help min­imise the chances of the virus mu­tat­ing sig­nif­i­cantly, she added.</p>
    <p>Still, sci­en­tists will need to closely track the evolv­ing virus to spot mu­ta­tions that may give it an edge over vac­cines.</p>
    <p>NOT AN ON-OFF SWITCH</p>
    <p>No one should worry that there is go­ing to be a sin­gle cat­a­strophic mu­ta­tion that sud­denly ren­ders all im­mu­nity and an­ti­bod­ies use­less. It is go­ing to be a process that oc­curs over the time scale of mul­ti­ple years and re­quires the ac­cu­mu­la­tion of mul­ti­ple vi­ral mu­ta­tions. It’s not go­ing to be like an on-off switch.</p>
